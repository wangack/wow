[0:18:46] Ezionn: Farming normal BG's feels so incredible lonely because its me as a player vs 90% scripted bots.

[0:24:11] nightmxz: @StromicusRex https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyL3j6kAap0
[0:24:14] StromicusRex: gonna become a body builder to counteract carpal tunnel
[0:24:17] Koraszdormu: @CoffeeASAP Good habit- Don't rage.  If you feel tilted, take a deep breath and move on to the next game.  If you let the BS that can happen get to you, you stop having fun.  And if you aren't having fun- what's the point?
[0:24:30] zerx_gg: the only logical solution StromicusRex
[0:24:31] StromicusRex: lmao night
[0:24:33] nightmxz: Good morning :)
[0:24:34] primejusticegaming: Hey ven, do you know if its possible to make a focus macro that has every classes kick or CC ability so you can reduce the amount of Macros you ahve?
[0:24:36] RoaminIrl: did not know maximum came out with a wow podcast will have to check it out. thanks chat!
[0:24:56] migliqt: i play and train for golf which helps
[0:25:11] StromicusRex: @zerx_gg as a writer and artist, it is indeed the only logical solution
[0:25:22] CoffeeASAP: @Koraszdormu Oh my mental is solid hah I just like having fun, but want to feel like I'm playing as best I can. Healing pugs in M+ for years has strengthed my head  against rage lol
[0:25:50] yippey_: @StromicusRex wrist and forearms mobility and exercise to strengthen your structures around the median nerve to prevent compression (which is what leads to CTS)
[0:25:58] StromicusRex: i was talking to zerx!
[0:26:07] StromicusRex: you are right
[0:26:16] StromicusRex: zerx wanna be silly with me i will be silly back
[0:26:22] primejusticegaming: I mean yes you could use them lol but then you have arena target 1,2,3 focus X and stuff on every class takes up your toon specific slots real quick
[0:26:26] zerx_gg: i am never silly, always serious
[0:26:31] zerx_gg: idiot
[0:26:36] CoffeeASAP: Thank you @venruki I appreciate it. I feel like I'm doing a good job of bursting and then ccing healer but i'm playing at the lowest level so far so who knows hah
[0:26:36] zerx_gg: xdd
[0:26:40] StromicusRex: if i could ban u..
[0:26:44] zerx_gg: but you cant
[0:26:47] primejusticegaming: unfortch
[0:26:49] zerx_gg: sucks to suck!!
[0:27:00] zerx_gg: anyway you're free of me for like 30 minutes
[0:27:04] StromicusRex: @yippey_ yeeah i used to do a bunch and stopped when they worked, time to go back lmao
[0:27:08] BCboy_: mod on mod crime PepoCheer
[0:27:11] StromicusRex: bye felicia
[0:27:19] famous1939: when you die, make sure to focus on what your team did wrong and could have done better for you
[0:27:22] Koraszdormu: Saving block for next round.
[0:27:22] jaullberg: You can do it if you use [known: Kick, @arena1] Kick
[0:27:36] stopeating: how important is learning positioning for arena
[0:27:39] EliteDamit: so true
[0:27:41] kusoneko: they had that for hardcore wow LUL
[0:27:50] phanabananana: Really good warrior lobby here
[0:27:53] nightmxz: Dying with ice block? Who would ever make that mistake LUL
[0:27:55] Koraszdormu: Someone code up the addon so that if you die with defensives up, it plays the Down goes Venruki sound clip Kappa
[0:27:57] belfastcl: teammates will usually remind you of the ice block Kappa
[0:27:59] RoaminIrl: does that work @jaullberg if so very cool
[0:28:00] StromicusRex: rukiDownGoes
[0:28:01] itz_killjoy: i like addons, why are ppl complaining about them so much now?
[0:28:02] azliaris1: this looks so bad for a warrior
[0:28:03] jaullberg: I have a macro for every kick in the shared macro tab
[0:28:04] azliaris1: wtf
[0:28:12] Saitistreamy: how many people do you think que BGs but not arenas?
[0:28:12] EliteDamit: Kappa
[0:28:13] kozlodui: Why they still not nerfing DH's
[0:28:21] phanabananana: lol
[0:28:22] zachgamegodx: u can use warcraft logs to log ur arena and you can reverse engineer all of your mistakes for sure
[0:28:35] RoaminIrl: so at the end of the macro you put the class kick or leave it just like that @jaullberg
[0:29:27] jaullberg: #showtooltip /cast [@arena1, known: Rebuke] Rebuke /cast [@arena1, known: Pummel] Pummel /cast [@arena1, known: Mind Freeze] Mind Freeze /cast [@arena1, known: Kick] Kick /cast [@arena1, known: Disrupt] Disrupt
[0:29:40] RoaminIrl: thanks
[0:29:50] jaullberg: Use the same for purges, dispels, stuns, etc
[0:30:10] RoaminIrl: nice cool to know thanks
[0:30:38] henkiwar: Is needing "known" a new necessity? Think I had mine without when I still played
[0:30:53] jaullberg: Yeah it won't work without known, it will only use the first spell in the list
[0:30:57] Saitistreamy: they need to bring back a portion of the precog haste buff lol
[0:31:12] henkiwar: damn, when did they change that?

[0:40:30] heymomimonttv: i've been enjoying ww more than warrior so far this season
[0:40:50] heymomimonttv: @azliaris1 i dont think u bladestorm for dmg really i think it's pressure and avoiding cc

[0:44:51] kusoneko: I WAITTTTTTEDDD 74 YEARSSSSS
[0:44:53] curseofthemorningwood: Id love to see some disc buffs. Feels very weak compared to other healers

[0:45:04] Hammer90x: that's so toxic lol
[0:45:22] nightmxz: I just want frost mage to get reworked for real this time instead of just ray of frost buff :)
[0:45:30] sethron: sethron subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Morning, Ven.  You were great on PoddyC
[0:45:32] kusoneko: I want to see Judgment on hpal do 100k non crit
[0:45:34] Jun_bug__: more throughput maybe?
[0:45:35] curseofthemorningwood: I dunno, im doing way better on my druid, but maybe im just a bad disc
[0:46:05] reavethederp: mage should scale soon
[0:46:08] zachgamegodx: do u really like the current mastery for frost?
[0:46:11] zachgamegodx: isnt it like icicles
[0:46:16] tidusisthedream: MORNING DAD
[0:46:24] heymomimonttv: i'd like to see arms hit a little higher again, hitting low 100s on MS and execute is dookie
[0:46:30] chubmax: chat, does crafting quality matter for pvp crafted items?
[0:46:57] gypsyeyez: hi
[0:47:17] Sideshift: hey ven
[0:47:17] imitatewater: @heymomimonttv what matters most is that arms as a spec is in a really good spot
[0:47:32] reavethederp: @chubmax i dont think it does, but im not certain
[0:47:33] Sideshift: I haven’t watched wow PvP in awhile. what specs are super strong / super bad?
[0:47:34] nightmxz: But the changes changed nothing about the gameplay or how we build our characters except we can get more of 1 secondary stat (which is a great change don't get me wrong) I want frostbite gone and splitting ice gone
[0:47:47] heymomimonttv: @imitatewater i think its in just an ok spot, it's mainly a utility class now and not so much a pumper.
[0:47:50] curseofthemorningwood: Is arms even bad or are DH, WW and rogues just way overtuned
[0:48:00] tidusisthedream: ven ty for streaming so consistently always look forward to waching u
[0:48:11] zachgamegodx: for defensives, id like to see blink stun removed obviously, not sure what the does about icy floes since it becomes infinitely worse with regular blink compared to shimmer but maybe thats fine
[0:48:15] imitatewater: @heymomimonttv if dh gets gutted arms is probably gonna be the best melee ( not counting rogues )
[0:48:15] sethron: I just want Frost to have less buttons so I feel like I can play it again
[0:48:19] nightmxz: Yeah isolated prey is really cool for sure
[0:48:25] zachgamegodx: id like to see displacement or alter times reset on blink gone, 1 of the 2
[0:48:37] Cariffo: what does it do??
[0:48:39] chubmax: @curseofthemorningwood DH/WW are for sure overtuned
[0:48:41] gsr_: what expac verson of frost mage was most fun?
[0:48:47] tidusisthedream: ty for always steaming ven u always make my mornings!
[0:48:49] chubmax: arms does really good consistent pressure
[0:48:54] heymomimonttv: @imitatewater right now i think WW dmg is profile is kinda similar to how arms should be. i dont love bleed build on arms which is my biggest issue
[0:49:03] nightmxz: Delete alter time, reduce shimmer cd to 18secs and have displacement refund a charge of shimmer :)
[0:49:07] nightmxz: Mage fixed EZ
[0:49:08] Secretwombatbro: just make it blink through time
[0:49:11] Synckery: make alter a longer CD but make it undispelable
[0:49:17] itz_killjoy: remove 1 charge of mobility from all classes :)
[0:49:17] tidusisthedream: to many demon hunters qin so qs are bugged
[0:49:24] Secretwombatbro: when you use blink/shimmer you cover like 30% hp
[0:49:26] itschen: do you when this season gonne end>
[0:49:32] Secretwombatbro: no more alter hehe
[0:49:35] zachgamegodx: blink stun sucks to play and play against like youve said
[0:49:40] zachgamegodx: i hate not being able to use my blink
[0:49:56] SloppyWalrus_: defensives and healing needs to be active choices, not passive
[0:50:07] nightmxz: Damage isn't permanent, it's a biproduct  of that
[0:50:20] nightmxz: A healer sees someone at 5% and presses 1 or 2 buttons to top

[0:50:38] imitatewater: @venruki is playing whirling dragon punch a must?
[0:50:44] Secretwombatbro: but blink stun makes you invisible to some rogues after the first kidney
[0:50:46] Secretwombatbro: its great
[0:50:47] itschen: do you know when this season gonna end?
[0:50:48] myStylez: lots of talk about class balance but isn't the real issue bots and lack of inflation?
[0:50:50] famous1939: hot take but i love blink stun, dont mind it since i get trained a lot and use the icy floes to run/cast land cc's
[0:50:52] agren13: Think it's both the strength of the defensives as well as the huge damage boost from stacking offensive cds in pvp
[0:50:57] zachgamegodx: assasination rogue has a reasonable defensive kit, cheat death is their "once a game" defensive, evasion 2minute cd, cloak 2 minute cd. you look down at omnibar u see cloak evasion on cd and you look at his debuffs and he has the chea tdeath debuff you know he can die in a swap
[0:51:17] zachgamegodx: demon hunter would have a reasonable defensive kit if their passives didn't give them a a wall passively
[0:51:21] heymomimonttv: yes he was
[0:51:35] itz_killjoy: u guys don't  change talents each rd?
[0:51:44] tidusisthedream: DO IT DAD!!!!!!!!

[0:52:52] Yimbus737: wasnt he making fun of the situation, not flaming you?
[0:52:56] ALLtheEXP: honestly, in SS I think it's wise to use YOUR cooldowns as DPS first to allow your healer to use theirs at a later time
[0:53:04] YayFiber: @Yimbus737 that's how i read it
[0:53:21] BCboy_: i swear theres some sniper shot bug or somthing ive seen people getting 1 shot by mm all week randomly
[0:54:16] Fros365: WideBoris
[0:54:31] drreww: he's never played a healer
[0:54:46] Yimbus737: oh nvm that does sound like blaming
[0:54:51] reavethederp: i think its just a reflex to not take blame on things
[0:55:06] Saitistreamy: hunter didnt even hit anything with the hunt still did 150k

[0:55:59] Encryptic_Tv: predictions on when tuning will finally happen?
[0:56:17] Encryptic_Tv: im tired of dh and destro every game on the ladder
[0:56:21] Saitistreamy: they arent going to tune anything till 10.2.6
[0:56:35] Saitistreamy: thats why this is massively bad
[0:56:37] katfished: maybe 10.2.6 is gonna be that cool, itll be worth the wait
[0:56:43] Fros365: VIBE
[0:57:08] NeroTVWoW: This hunter face-tanking dam refuses to turtle is just solo shuffle in a nutshell.
[0:57:09] Saitistreamy: its just delayed longer then they wanted it to be, so they are shipping changes with it, but now its taking too long so they are kinda screwed
[0:57:10] nikthevoker: SKEWTCHYYYY
[0:57:37] CabinetMistake: i still like the snipershot negative correlation in that skillcapped video lol

[1:04:19] BCboy_: atleast lower the cd if they wanna make the healing bad
[1:04:46] FatalStrats: re-wind should bring everyone back to starting gates with countdown going, just restart the match

[1:08:48] Jakora: Ven, does your old teammate sodah still play the game? how is he doing? great healer
[1:08:52] hobk1204: doubt
[1:08:57] heymomimonttv: @ent3n get more conq gear in 2s or bg blitz before healing in solo shuffle. you will 0-6 most lobbies in honor gear this late in the season
[1:09:00] chancywilson: i ate 100 MGs n just sank into my seat and it was amazing
[1:09:08] ZiegeOG: best movie ive ever seen
[1:09:13] ChumpSeason: the helms deeps scene the 1st time watching was pog for sure
[1:09:30] hobk1204: yeah but people lose their minds about horrible movies all the time. Dune 1 was meh
[1:09:33] chancywilson: IDK it wasnt that diff then the 1st one both were great
[1:09:39] CaranoBlaze: You should review it.
[1:09:42] 2pikula: i thought the visuals we're incredible. the story was good but not best movie ever!
[1:09:42] katfished: went to an early access imax, and then went 2 more times this last week. only other movie i remember going to more than once was top gun 2
[1:09:53] heymomimonttv: 100mg is pretty ez
[1:10:00] waelrick: @2pikula this is the correct take
[1:10:03] turn1concede: are we talking about fentanyl

[1:10:05] What_ln_Tarnation: i loved dune 1
[1:10:08] sethron: at 100mg you become the Dune
[1:10:11] CaranoBlaze: Dune 2 is significantly better than Dune 1.
[1:10:19] Mrshmyt: 10 mg of what?
[1:10:19] yippey_: if 100mg is easy, you need a taper LMAO
[1:10:20] waelrick: story was mid, but visuals were outstanding
[1:10:21] heymomimonttv: 10mg i dont even notice

[1:10:32] boogie113_: 10 mg of what?
[1:10:35] checkemcharles: i think the art style in the 1984 movie is better but the pacing of the stiry is better in the remakes

[1:11:56] Bennton: @venruki took 100mg the other day by accident, thought it was the last time I was going to see my children, changed my life really.
[1:12:01] pizzanwingz: that was a solid pull through

[1:41:50] chaps_86: if he said that to me
[1:41:54] Bourbons86: disabling chat has led to me going from 600cr to 2300cr. Struggled to climb because I would just leave all lobbies where a dps talked trash
[1:42:09] Applezbtw: @Bourbons86 this is 100% accurate

[1:44:19] agren13: sending jonathan down to the lower bracket :(
[1:44:19] Bourbons86: @reaperz14 not sure about that lol, I haven't left in 2-3 days worth of sessions and owe it to the disabled chat 100%, even when I am losing, my head space is much better with chat disabled
[1:44:24] Cojax11: Just 6-0 every game ez

[1:45:26] Bourbons86: @JustDai_TV yeah this 100%. The whole "go on X or swap to Y" isn't that helpful most of the time anyway imo
[1:45:31] PPowzer74: do you like dried fruit?
[1:45:32] freelofear: 3-3 lost 30 mmr lol
[1:45:37] JustDai_TV: I haven't played retail in a while, do healers still have 200~ish rating less than equivalent dps?
[1:45:46] BMaStream: Hey, Venruki! I'm trying to get into smoking, any tips?
[1:45:50] kusoneko: did mmr squish?
[1:45:50] jporter_: @JustDai_TV ya, nothings changed

[1:47:18] jporter_: fiance and I are watching first Dune tonight then going to the theatre tomorrow. super pumped

[1:48:28] infraredpen: Just watched the podcast you did with Maximum and Dratnos. Really enjoyed your appearance on there, it was a great listen!
[1:48:31] vodkacran: I was so sad when they delayed dune two because of the strikes
[1:48:32] grimmjowhd: i fell asleep in theaters during dune 1
[1:48:34] grimmjowhd: lol
[1:48:37] Bruteson: Song name? :)

[1:49:01] TyHeals: Also watched it this morning, great episode.
[1:49:02] spirantsix: Me and the wife watched it again before going to the second and when it ended we were both like oh its over. Felt like an hour not almost 3
[1:49:02] Applezbtw: now hopefuly blizzard watches it
[1:49:06] jporter_: was an excellent listen, made work fly by
[1:49:07] TripleXTN: slightly slow. like the scene where they rescue the mining crew thing in the helicopter from the worm felt unneeded honestly. I loved it because I love exposition, but not for everyone
[1:49:08] goesidd: only 130k more until u pass asmon

[2:13:52] Blastmindx: hey at least you're up rating at all

[2:14:22] FatalStrats: mr abrocket with the 1 win on the game he didnt tower dive in the opener

[2:15:38] FatalStrats: agreed, evoker is best to watch
[2:15:39] figurines: evoker is one of the most fun healers. to play and watch. but it can be so hard to do well on
[2:15:40] SweatyDaniels: evoker my favorite healer
[2:15:42] codyallyn: I think evoker and fw are the most fun to watch

[2:15:56] shad3dspectr3: KEKW
[2:15:57] Blastmindx: yeah i think fw and prevoker are the most fun to watch cuz they are just in there perma aggro basically
[2:15:57] thatguy1632: only healer i havent played so no idea whats going on lol

[2:16:18] sanatalive: stop egoizing
[2:16:21] joyrex_j9: its more relatable when you play
[2:16:28] codyallyn: I do like how meep calls out everything he's doing, so its obvious why he's doing what he's doing
[2:16:33] CoffeeASAP: you're the best evoker Ive ever seen in pvp, although you're the first
[2:16:34] goesidd: thats many rounds

[2:17:36] zachgamegodx: dragon will be fun to watch next szn with living flame instants
[2:17:42] goesidd: its an mmr thing and its a 1v1 instead of 1v3 thing
[2:17:46] figurines: don't get put into priority Q. you get lower MMR healers a lot of the time
[2:17:47] Dalfire: peace, have to go back to treat some neck and backs
[2:17:49] figurines: leave Q and re-1
[2:17:50] vortex071232: hey ruki how do you feel about disc lately?
[2:17:55] raven1103: God I can't wait for war within the state of wow is so sad for me :(
[2:18:01] vortex071232: i tried playing it and feel like i dont heal
[2:18:14] joyrex_j9: they should probably find a more clever way to do the MMR for healers that isnt just directly compared to the enemy healer
[2:18:22] joyrex_j9: since the enemy healer is actually the least important person
[2:18:41] vortex071232: well it has some importance
[2:18:49] MATTwithanM: whats the best website for pvp talents, etc.? Murlok?
[2:18:50] CabinetMistake: chat i'm leveling a priest for the first time since legion

[2:22:02] cantfindthebox: something at some time might happen with the chair
[2:22:25] JustDai_TV: @CabinetMistake it's not baseline anymore, but void form still exists in the shadow tree as a talent. Void Eruption activates it

[2:41:46] zerx_gg: and then wonder why no one q healers xdding
[2:41:49] nikthevoker: all from 1 hunter

[2:41:50] driftwood_tc: I wonder why no one likes to heal anymore in SS
[2:41:52] ogkoop: Classic tilter lobby
[2:41:54] Skillcap: healing is fun guys :)
[2:41:56] CabinetMistake: at least we still have the oatmeal Sadge
[2:41:58] Texdizzle: jonathann just needs teammates half as good as him and hed be r1 mmkay

[2:42:01] tarth_100: Just triple 6-0 next three lobbies, u got this
[2:42:05] carneasada34: this last 5 queues is precisely why healing shuffle sucks and theres a healer shortage.
[2:42:08] Shores2424: hip hip hooray
[2:42:10] riba000: I was in this chat like 2 weeks ago talking about how I want to start playing a healer

[2:42:20] carneasada34: you dont get rewards, and the people are terrible humans
[2:42:22] riba000: today I am here to announce that I do not in fact want to start playing a healer
[2:42:26] invincibledalyeth: hey @venruki  hope today is a good day buddy
[2:42:26] joyrex_j9: none of this would have happened if you just healed jonathan properly
[2:42:27] hawgcast: Jonathan is definitely 1 of the warriors of all time
[2:42:28] rawrces: why do you loose more on 1 loss than gian in 3 wins?
[2:42:31] rawrces: why is that?
[2:42:42] Texdizzle: jonathann went by the name of laintime in classic
[2:42:47] CabinetMistake: rukiCreep
[2:42:59] ogkoop: Tragic
[2:43:02] stickchip: The crazy thing is why does your mmr decrease by 3 but your rating decreases by 48!
[2:43:03] thewy: 0 and 3 cr for 4/2 LOL
[2:43:06] mcbroner06: mcbroner06 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Sup Ven!
[2:43:07] smokechiefx: this is what deters me from ever considering healing
[2:43:24] leeka: i wonder why no one heals
[2:43:35] Kujo_XX: And thus the reason I'm saving my $15 a month
[2:43:36] stickchip: But why didn't your MMR increase on any of those 'win' matches
[2:43:36] carneasada34: 16-14 on the day and down 30 rating
[2:43:46] Kujo_XX: It's the most maddening waste of time on the market
[2:43:47] BCboy_: Classic
[2:43:51] SaintHearth: they need change the way rating gain changes and make it more linier accross the board
[2:43:53] eceria: Please show it to Blizzard
[2:43:55] Tpyoeror: if healers just healed
[2:44:05] Zartirian: thought shadowlands was bad... this is just quit worthy
[2:44:06] CabinetMistake: 16-14 and down 30 jesus @carneasada34
[2:44:09] robbpy: rating gains should be fixed and not based on mmr, period
[2:44:14] Cocoapuffs1: they fact they limit how you gain mmr at all is such a joke
[2:44:16] Kujo_XX: It's even more maddening that they have all the data, but SoD and AWC are more important
[2:44:19] robbpy: at least on ss
[2:44:28] gdodmebxu: @sainthearth linear
[2:44:35] Zartirian: dont worry bro the next SOD season is out!

[2:46:24] storm_chaser_ron: well ven if he didnt have to play with no stun dargons hed be 2600\
[2:46:25] CabinetMistake: he lives there you were just visiting
[2:46:26] FlyFYI: its usually the people who talk poop that are stuck
[2:46:29] driftwood_tc: 2k rating is the worst most toxic imo. People think they are better than they are, and their egos cant handle it.
[2:46:32] Zartirian: and players like him contribute to long queue times
[2:46:36] Aby3200: Ven how to improve video settings for earthen wall

[2:51:47] storm_chaser_ron: @squarepusher_ the hunt initial dam was pretty marginal
[2:51:55] galdinator: its because melee classes get kited, so when they get uptime it has to be rewarding
[2:51:56] storm_chaser_ron: he paused after hunt hit
[2:52:16] Reuhn: @galdinator dhs literally fly over whole arena

[4:28:10] addyz0r: which setting was that?
[4:28:34] addyz0r: got it
[4:28:37] TootinFresh: Deep haunt makes all targets take 20% extra DMG from dots

[4:46:20] skez_live: nice bodify!
[4:46:23] Bodify: yea lol, its messy but it gets the job done
[4:46:33] ItsPriceyy: @Bodify Does this addon change totem plates?
[4:46:34] skez_live: what other cool stuff can we do
[4:46:44] zerx_gg: i dont think its messy at all for how many options there are lol
[4:46:55] Bodify: @ItsPriceyy There is a different addon called BetterBlizzPlates which is for nameplates and does totems yes
[4:47:14] skez_live: are there any Buffs/Debuffs you want to highlight on the target or focus? You can add those to Whitelist and click important
[4:47:49] Bodify: Yes, add them to blacklist yea by name/id
[4:47:49] ItsPriceyy: @Bodify Thanks man, is this similar visual to how Ven's looks?
[4:48:03] ItsPriceyy: For totems
[4:48:05] Axtin: should prob filter dampening in target/focus

[4:48:31] Axtin: and targ of focus
[4:48:31] Ronsimus: @Bodify if possible, it would be very nice to have the option to make targets out of range darker on the raid frame. its hard to see if someone is in range sometimes
[4:48:43] hunchurio: hey my name's kellen lol
[4:48:54] hunchurio: that's not me tho
[4:49:00] Magottx: i feel like you'll notice when rdruids are goin for clones etc
[4:49:06] Axtin: blizz has it un such a bad spot it should be hugging the frame more, i moved mine with MoveAny
[4:49:12] Bodify: @ItsPriceyy Not entirely sure how ven has it setup but probably, check the screenshots on curseforge
[4:49:32] dewwy_o: even if rdruids are going for clones could be a macro for a separate arena target
[4:49:36] noirlol: looks clean tho
[4:49:47] addyz0r: Chan made a whole new char yesterday to redo his frames.
[4:50:13] zerx_gg: @Ronsimus check out RaidFrameSettings addon

[4:55:34] TimmyShoes: @Xeliumimar he actually acknowledges this, keep watching the vid
[4:56:05] ImSmoothz: @venruki Thats not a 100% fool proof way ill tell you why
[4:56:19] freelofear: I had a DH get stuck in mugambala starting room every round lol, the other team went up stairs and the bot would move around trying to attack them
[4:56:27] ogkoop: Makes sense. Pretty strong indicator at the least. Smart
[4:56:29] TheMercDeadpool: My favorite are the monks using rop on priest's barrier with pixel perfect accuracy every time
[4:56:37] williwhite94: LMAOOOO
[4:56:43] ImSmoothz: @venruki people who have keyboards that allow you to have a spam macro. alowing you to press a key and have it spam 1000 times. gives you a simlar thing were u cast faster
[4:56:43] FateIRL: thats pathetic
[4:56:45] Frig0z: that's so bad
[4:56:55] mrmsix6: that's just an average DH player, nothing out of the ordinary
[4:56:59] williwhite94: ofc it is lOL
[4:57:02] Badasti: i was in a game... "Anyone who has a face and a keyboard" lmao, I love that
[4:57:05] Xeliumimar: blizzard doesnt ban unless you flame some one in shuffle
[4:57:08] williwhite94: he is prolly in SS rn while he at work
[4:57:13] Badasti: you almost caused me to lose with that comment
[4:57:13] TimmyShoes: not just an account ban imo, a name ban. like you shouldn't be able to make new accounts after this.
[4:57:13] FlyFYI: its a bling person playing dh LUL
[4:57:15] Badasti: that was hilarious
[4:57:15] ImSmoothz: so watching globals will show false posatives with people who have keyboards with spam macros
[4:57:18] FlyFYI: using echo location
[4:57:23] SlyMooseMan: Probably Q'in right now.
[4:57:31] DoYouSeeOk: i reported a bot on SOD got bail from blizz a day or 2 later on retail last time i id that it took months
[4:57:33] ImSmoothz: Watching globals is an old trick from wod against botters
[4:57:38] DoYouSeeOk: mail*
[4:57:52] williwhite94: tbh i think blizz is letting this happen so they can kill this game from the inside @venruki
[4:57:52] ImSmoothz: @venruki people who have keyboards that allow you to have a spam macro. alowing you to press a key and have it spam 1000 times. gives you a simlar thing were u cast faster

[4:58:52] nubcakemeng: @venruki You should not ban these immediately because it's an arms race for software. You need to gather data and then ban them in a way where they don't know what triggered the bans.
[4:58:58] booba1421: It’s so good and important that supatease s facing and addressing these problems
[4:59:00] eloriene: guy should be insta banned for logging in with some shit like this

[5:00:22] zerx_gg: they cast on a freelance basis Vramii

[5:00:26] zerx_gg: they're just like you and me
[5:00:52] williwhite94: someone has to make an addon that tracks software usage for blizzard and let it be built in

[5:10:47] Bakes00: how many hours in queue is that?
[5:10:51] eloriene: 7300 games * an average wait of 30 mins is 3650 HOURS OF JUST WAITING

[5:11:26] Robofat: @eloriene its not 7300 games but 7300 rounds so only 1k+ games
[5:11:28] cantfindthebox: What's the song?
[5:11:29] ferahgok: They say it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert. My man Rend is well on his way!
[5:11:32] Cocoapuffs1: Also 1 game is 6 rounds
[5:11:35] eloriene: ok let's assume 20 min average then it's 2410 hours
[5:11:38] leeka: that warrior has the 2nd most wins in NA shuffle
[5:11:49] Jihnn: @eloriene You're confusing games and rounds
[5:11:59] Wrathbb1: @eloriene you need to check your math lmfao
[5:12:01] ferahgok: My guy is in the hyperbolic time chamber, training his ass off to be the best. Your envy is showing chat
[5:12:31] eloriene: ok 7300 games is not 7300 rounds so divide 2410 by 6
[5:12:33] Sheepyou: @eloriene its 7k GAMES so its 7000:6 its like 1200 games
[5:12:37] Zenfuzz: You like aff spec the best for lock to have fun?

[5:13:44] Robofat: ques are not 30 min at lower mmr
[5:13:44] husquatch: thats like what a month of your life gone just sitting in q?
[5:13:45] zerx_gg: bro loves world of warcraft
[5:13:47] magnesiium1: bro has sat around 400 hours of just que waiting
[5:13:48] Xeliumimar: TEENAGE WASTELANDDDD
[5:13:50] eloriene: it's 1216 rounds or so, assume 20 min wait per round? that = about 406 hours in waiting
[5:14:01] Wrathbb1: @Dopaminex they say it takes 1,000 hours to learn something so they got a ways to go
[5:14:03] magnesiium1: like dawg
[5:14:04] eloriene: that does not count hte time actually playing
[5:14:08] magnesiium1: 400 hours just afk waiting
[5:14:08] rynosaurwow: My guess is he works from home and sits in que while doing work.
[5:14:10] magnesiium1: like what the fuck
[5:14:14] Dopaminex: that's 610 hours of waiting for q pop, 405 hours of shuffling (assuming each shuffle is an average of 20 minutes), roughly 42 full days of shuffling or waiting to shuffle
[5:14:28] zerx_gg: time to end the season
[5:14:30] zerx_gg: poor guy
[5:14:32] R1_Prototype: I mean, are you guys not running two accounts? queuing them at the same time? Are you  trolling then? JK JK
[5:14:40] Wrathbb1: Total War players are over here like :)
[5:14:41] baxter5569: i get bored/annoyed after i hit the 400-500 round mark
[5:14:41] Sheepyou: 7k games on 6 rounds is about 1200+ games average wait time lets say 20mins its like 400+ hours of q time
[5:14:41] magnesiium1: @Dopaminex someone hurt this man and said he has a small penis or something.
[5:14:43] Robofat: i watch movies between ques
[5:14:50] baxter5569: just call it a day. this is a true gamer o7
[5:15:09] peeachy8: I watch shows when I wait lol but damn they really like shuffle
[5:15:36] emergencxyz: yeah its about 450/500 hrs of waiting for shuf pops depending on your wait time
[5:15:39] baxter5569: lesson learned. do 7000 games and hit 2400 by attrition and lobby RNG
[5:15:43] RenanFleck: !addons
[5:15:43] Moobot: @RenanFleck Details, SArena, Omnibar, OmniCD, Big Debuffs, Weak Auras, RaiderIO addon
[5:15:54] magnesiium1: 400 hours of waiting roughly with 20 min q times
[5:15:56] hellotwice: idk how rendlol is not banned, he told me to kms in pretty graphic detail after a ss
[5:15:58] Dizzlx: @baxter5569 he likely peaked long ago and has slowly gone down
[5:16:03] Dopaminex: assuming that gentleman sleeps for 8 hours a day, that means that since this patch came out 113 days ago on november 14th 2023 he has been shuffling (either in game or waiting for game) for more time than he hasn't been
[5:16:45] Sheepyou: u can say this guy LOVES warrior
[5:16:45] Dopaminex: (113 days ago, 38 of which he would have slept through assuming 8 hours per night, 42 days spent shuffling and the remaining 33 days spent doing something else)
[5:16:49] Dopaminex: and that accounts for one character.
[5:16:56] zerx_gg: look at all these algebros
[5:17:01] Dizzlx: he just plays the one character
[5:17:09] baxter5569: wonder if this guy is a tweaker. solo shuffle really grinds most down. wonder if he rages most days
[5:17:11] ALLtheEXP: r/ theydidthemath
[5:17:49] peeachy8: I mean damage wise they are doing very well
[5:17:56] Dopaminex: it is crazy to think that assuming 30 minute average waits, 20 minute average shuffles, that that dude has spent more time shuffling since the season came out
[5:18:01] Dopaminex: than he has spent time both sleeping, or not shuffling
[5:18:06] Bourbons86: good game, nice playing with ya:)
[5:18:21] Dopaminex: (38 hours and 33 hours respectfully lmao)
[5:18:26] magnesiium1: 7k+

[5:18:47] notoriousztv: times 30 mins
[5:18:50] emergencxyz: 7273
[5:18:52] emergencxyz: rounds

[5:19:39] magnesiium1: GAMER
[5:19:40] Dopaminex: then double that number bc you have to account for the amount of time he spends IN the shuffle games
[5:19:47] Dopaminex: and the season came out 113 days ago
[5:19:50] dismantlle: xdd
[5:19:53] ferahgok: @Dopaminex Although the season has been out for 105 days. So that's not that crazy in that context
[5:19:54] nikthevoker: thats it?
[5:19:55] Dopaminex: roughly 40 days of which he would be asleep for bc of 8 hours per day
[5:20:03] notoriousztv: thats just an estimate
[5:20:07] Gushingcoom: wonder how many ques he's missed
[5:20:08] famous1939: full time shuff degen, i can relate

[5:20:36] willie_stroker_99: I tell you what he does, he plays
[5:20:41] shugguls: he would have got to 2400 in half that time if he played a DH
[5:20:55] Dumblexgamer: @venruki  remember there are games with leavers haha
[5:20:55] Dopaminex: oh i reported this guy
[5:21:04] Dizzlx: @shugguls i guarantee you he was 2400 in his first 100 games the rest has been pure madness
[5:21:17] nikthevoker: i swear i had like 10k games
[5:21:42] Dopaminex: 150k is low tbh LMAO

[5:26:23] dismantlle: I think they first were unsuccessful playing themselves and then get bots
[5:26:27] repsac1442: the funny thing is they keep all there stuff if they get banned
[5:26:33] potkopvp: @Wrathbb1 yea but they dont really use them, mostly sell them and get data from the douchebags who use them
[5:26:34] Garthd: Not just pleasure, they sell that stuff, and if you live in a poorer country uou can make a realtive fourtune
[5:26:38] uhzyncz: Csgo has a vod review thing where u watch peoples games from when theyre reported and u ban them if its undeniable. U need a certain status to be eligible
[5:26:43] cornflakes_au_getchop: they rather spend cash on IA / automation stuff instead of paying people doing it manually
[5:26:46] Wrathbb1: @potkopvp  yeah i just mean thats why we have them at all
[5:26:46] MorcsXL: bruh 5 add bomb. why you doing me like this
[5:26:46] repsac1442: it’s disgusting
[5:26:48] cornflakes_au_getchop: and they accept the fail in it
[5:26:55] famous1939: when you can't hold on.. hold on
[5:26:55] cornflakes_au_getchop: as long as they dont loose money
[5:26:56] Bodify: I understand the banwaves for non competitive stuff but competitive bots should be insta banned, they do in every other game
[5:26:58] potkopvp: @Wrathbb1 yea for sure
[5:27:06] stopeating: its a video game problem, CS had the same issue
[5:27:08] Wrathbb1: @potkopvp but you are right no disagreement.
[5:27:15] skez_live: shuffle roulette time?? :)
[5:27:17] repsac1442: they should have a record button in game for that kinda stuff so you can send it directly to blizz
[5:27:21] uhzyncz: https://youtu.be/0JN8Nque1Sc?si=zMmQDMDKumVafaUn
[5:27:51] Wrathbb1: @repsac1442 windows is easy to do
[5:27:54] dismantlle: I started playing OSRS again few months ago but that game is like 70% bots and i hated it
[5:27:54] repsac1442: make a whisper window
[5:27:57] R1_Prototype: separate whisper window
[5:28:01] Jihnn: Jonathann rukiS
[5:28:01] potkopvp: @venruki make a chat window called whispers and only enable whispers there
[5:28:09] LordRatigan: You don't have a separate chat window that just records whispers and Btag messages?
[5:28:13] dinalia: lol jonathan....
[5:28:13] repsac1442: yes you can lol
[5:28:18] Zeniticon: You can remove Trade-service by left clicking
[5:28:26] Wrathbb1: @repsac1442 windows key+alt+W opens the interface to record
[5:28:33] R1_Prototype: like just a tab for whispers? lmao
[5:28:34] smokechiefx: wait was it my boy jonathann
[5:28:36] Sheepyou: i have seperated chats for years lol
[5:28:40] dismantlle: what a brain dead message xd
[5:28:47] repsac1442: because it wasn’t like that every gamw
[5:28:54] TheMercDeadpool: Check that guy's hard drive
[5:28:55] repsac1442: they found a way to exploit the bot
[5:28:55] addyz0r: the bot made an account to say that XD
[5:28:57] ultra_content: hes the dh bot
[5:29:04] nikthevoker: LLU
[5:29:09] Wrathbb1: lol no one likes bots in pvp what is that take
[5:29:10] repsac1442: lol
[5:29:16] exxornfm: the bot out performs elite players outside of the wall bug it looks like
[5:29:19] Wrathbb1: that is hilarious wtf
[5:29:22] stopeating: what are your BIS protein shake ingredients
[5:29:22] exxornfm: so big issue
[5:29:23] Hobblefoot: He is not serious. Because no one is that stupid.
[5:29:24] Dizzlx: why would you care about entire matches being ruined cmon mannnn
[5:29:24] razzmatazzt: U gonns try dev.lock tonight?
[5:29:27] R1_Prototype: that guy eats food off the floor. prove me wrong
[5:29:28] Wrathbb1: delulu is the solulu
[5:29:29] dinalia: ill take jonathan over a bot any day  lol
[5:29:40] karthos: loved your episode of PoddyC, Ven. really good discussions
[5:29:42] TheSticksAndBricks: you want to have fun in a video game? what's wrong with you
[5:29:46] LordRatigan: If you make a new Tab and then   go to setting you can select to only show Whispers/Btag so you can always see what was sent with trade chat rolling
[5:29:46] addyz0r: some people just shows that being lobotimised and alive is a thing xD
[5:29:47] cadillacseville: if your floor is clean what does it matter if you eat off the floor or not
[5:30:12] Wrathbb1: @cadillacseville wait they are multiplying.... like the bacteria they are eating!
[5:30:13] skez_live: next blizz is gonna be secretly putting bot healers in shuffle Qs  so dps players wont complain about long waits haha
[5:30:16] hamsti: I think so
[5:30:25] sadbeyou: its account wide
[5:30:26] Izzythediscpriest: blizz needs to employ the people making the bots so we can get npc bots to q solo with to shorten q times
[5:30:27] AtomJar: imagine if blizz makes healer bots to speed up dps Q :)
[5:30:28] sadbeyou: yes
[5:30:34] brutusbrbr: remember playing classic BG and got a full hord bot team was INSANE
[5:30:34] hamsti: IMO bots aren't inherently a bad thing if tuned to play humanlike or at least semi humanlike. Imagine how fast queues would be if blizzard supplemented player slots with bots. They'd have to be pretty good though
[5:30:39] TootinFresh: how do you like void elf lock
[5:30:41] potkopvp: @venruki is poddyc on spotify?
[5:30:42] hamsti: lmao yeah
[5:30:45] cadillacseville: as a man that sits to pee, i would gladly toss ketchup right in front of my toilet and eat fries. filthy standers.
[5:30:45] Magottx: I want to sub afflic with oblivion
[5:31:01] Wrathbb1: yeah practice mode would be good for some people for sure
[5:31:01] dismantlle: @Izzythediscpriest wait a second... if both sides had healer bots tho PepoThink
[5:31:08] Wrathbb1: @dismantlle sign me up
[5:31:16] R1_Prototype: arena skirmish should be bots. so its instant ques.
[5:31:17] dinalia: @cadillacseville wtf?  lol
[5:31:17] Wrathbb1: WTB healer bots cmon cheaters
[5:31:28] Wrathbb1: do something right for once
[5:31:29] Sheepyou: healing bots in shuffle would be cool , dunno why
[5:31:30] dinalia: go fore it
[5:31:31] Bodify: One rapid fire later
[5:31:32] addyz0r: sounds eew
[5:31:36] dinalia: *go for it
[5:31:39] Magottx: We need a 4th frost mage
[5:31:40] strafekey: down for mage
[5:31:41] tragixxz: How are windwalker monks going at the moment?
[5:31:42] hamsti: Kappa impossible to make a bot for a healer. You have to have a massive brain and huge IQ score to play healer
[5:31:42] ram13ll: cheating of any kind is bad.. i dont understand how people can do it...dont know how they can live with themselves
[5:31:44] tomer_186: maybe this bots are created by blizzard and final version will be healers so we can have insta soloq :D
[5:31:44] greenflamingo117: I'm here to watch you play mage
[5:31:46] nikthevoker: some devoker always good (not bias) LUL
[5:31:51] YayFiber: Anybody playing feral atm? Is it any fun?
[5:31:52] Wrathbb1: @tomer_186 pls
[5:31:58] Wrathbb1: stop toying with my heart
[5:31:59] W00dyyx: Bring back Ieatmages
[5:32:01] Magottx: It’s your job! You get a pass
[5:32:02] R1_Prototype: @Wrathbb1 yesssssss
[5:32:09] Roxxybolts: what’s up brotha man
[5:32:12] Hobblefoot: Here is a crazy take:  Cheating and cheaters suck.  They ruin the game for everyone else. Even if they are bad at cheating. Moreover, they are losers that feel like being validated over achieving 'wins' illegitimately somehow means they are good.  Here is a tip, cheaters.  That 1200 player is 10x the player you are, you piece of trash.   Okay that is all for today for me.
[5:32:36] Wrathbb1: @Hobblefoot fresh pasta?
[5:32:38] Roxxybolts: top 30 sheeeeeeeesh
[5:32:39] hamsti: Yeah cheating is bad --- bots not necessarily @Hobblefoot
[5:32:41] Roxxybolts: who’s this guy
[5:32:42] pans_pov: @venruki really enjoyed your podcast with the boys, near the end you mentioned WAs in the pvp scene, any chance you can tease us with what you were thinking? some that come to mind are Mind Games WA a cc and int tracker
[5:33:18] pans_pov: p sure private auras don't affect pvp at all
[5:33:18] Bodify: Yeah
[5:33:20] Sheepyou: @venruki how many shuffle games do you have on all ur alts
[5:33:25] Hobblefoot: Yeah not sure why this topic sets me off.  But if you are using a Bot to win over someone you are garbage and need therapy for your raging insecurities.
[5:33:25] Garthd: yes
[5:33:35] pans_pov: trinket?
[5:33:39] ImSmoothz: dr
[5:33:44] Kymagez: my rating
[5:33:44] leeka: drinking?
[5:33:47] Bodify: I think they need to prune the amount of auras and make the UI better. Weakauras are just solution to a bad ui and 10000 trash auras
[5:33:48] leeka: healing totem
[5:33:48] Wrathbb1: how funny would it be if they used hidden auras to give everyone randomized base stats like D&D characters
[5:33:50] Gapplebees1: DR's?
[5:33:51] Dizzlx: gcd tracker is sus
[5:33:51] tbg1122: d/r ?
[5:33:58] Mokuof300: brooooo this song was on nfs underground 2
[5:34:06] brutusbrbr: everything, F*ck it, do it R A W
[5:34:13] MorcsXL: its not the game its human emotion, why do people take performance inhancing druids
[5:34:15] pans_pov: interrupt? so samiyam can't go godmode with the cyclones
[5:34:16] MorcsXL: drugs
[5:34:18] R1_Prototype: anyone botting arena is probably doing so to get the glad mount and then sell that account. maybe im wrong tho
[5:34:28] biofreaks: aff doesn’t feel too bad in SS. I think it has to do with the quick dampening.
[5:34:42] pans_pov: can only bot in SS not rated
[5:34:42] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[5:34:46] brutusbrbr: I would love to Hide totems, getting totem snipped bc some WA feels CHEAP
[5:34:47] Roxxybolts: idk what I’m gonna eat for dinner I have chicken tendies raw and hamburger meat gimme your best
[5:34:50] dismantlle: @MorcsXL imo botting competitive is like botting going to gym irl. like why even bother xd
[5:34:54] cadillacseville: weak auras are only necessary for pve because the base buff/debuffs and power auras are terrible. filter out buffs/your own power auras and weak auras wouldnt be necessary at all.
[5:34:57] Blastmindx: you cant get glad mount from shuffle so
[5:35:03] AtomJar: the problem is blizz waits for big ban waves
[5:35:05] Blastmindx: nobody is botting in shuffle for glad mount
[5:35:13] AtomJar: instead of doing it more often
[5:35:15] Blastmindx: they are botting for no reason basically
[5:35:16] skez_live: def dont eat any raw meat
[5:35:18] nightmxz: Woah woah woah Pokemons was unjustly banned 10 times, he just practices his rotation A LOT every day so he does it very well
[5:35:27] Roxxybolts: some people assume like Tyson chicken tendies
[5:35:33] nightmxz: LMFAO
[5:35:37] Roxxybolts: but I just have chicken tendies uncooked
[5:35:44] Endoraesh: movie in the making there
[5:35:47] ram13ll: Hey Ven.. do you think its worth subscribing to the skilled capped website if I am a player that does not have that much time to play... im currently stopping as soon as i reach 1800 but the next glad mount seem to be purple..so I want it hehe
[5:35:57] Wrathbb1: @Roxxybolts at the grocery store, like any of them right?
[5:36:00] Wrathbb1: I get them at TJ
[5:36:03] cadillacseville: someone tell him not microwaving leftovers doesnt mean they are uncooked
[5:36:33] tikdoks: skill capped worked for me
[5:36:33] Roxxybolts: chicken tenderloins is what they are advertised as
[5:36:45] biofreaks: @ram13ll I wouldn’t, watching streams is very helpful! and it’s free!
[5:36:49] skez_live: rofl
[5:36:50] Izzythediscpriest: make some meatballs and stick a tendie inside
[5:36:50] david_v_goldberg: where info about new glad mount for next seasone?
[5:36:51] Kymagez: tenderloinx
[5:36:52] Wrathbb1: I made chicken tenderloins for dinner last night
[5:36:53] turnipstampede: asks someone eating raw chicken tendies if they have any vegetables LOL
[5:36:54] Wrathbb1: literally
[5:37:05] foreverloved: kickbots that kick late are the worst. you cant even tell its a bot
[5:37:14] skez_live: ROFL
[5:37:17] Wrathbb1: wut
[5:37:18] ram13ll: ty Ven and ty @biofreaks
[5:37:19] TheMercDeadpool: Oh hell yeah
[5:37:28] Roxxybolts: what am I hearing right now
[5:37:35] Roxxybolts: I’m contacting the authorities
[5:37:37] Wrathbb1: the most NA shit you ever done hear

[5:37:44] Izzythediscpriest: i like going to wendys and getting a baconator and sticking a spicy chicken in between the burger pattys
[5:38:05] R1_Prototype: yeah doing solo isn't getting you the mount. but they gotta get the conquest gear to then farm the mount. but my thinking is your not going to bot solo shuffle on an account you care about.
[5:38:07] Roxxybolts: my dear god
[5:38:13] LordRatigan: rukiHmm
[5:38:17] ram13ll: @david_v_goldberg  i saw a screenshot somewhere...but not sure if its real on not

[5:39:35] AdvancingBlade: Hey, Ven, have any advice for a survival at 2050 looking to push higher?
[5:39:36] Tragictomb: you’d either get a dope sandwich or invited out behind the dumpster
[5:39:40] ImSmoothz: to big
[5:39:42] ogkoop: Ah
[5:39:44] skez_live: I better go eat a healthy dinner before I start ordering doordash for some trash lol

[5:39:55] tikdoks: I mean you have poutine up there and that is something I could not get with
[5:39:56] mindrazor: You'd have to have python jaw to eat that.
[5:40:07] Wrathbb1: 2.16

[6:02:09] carlosdermeister: i'm suffering on my affliction warlock at 1800 and i'm not enjoying it LUL

[6:04:10] Badasti: i dunno what hasan said but i cant stand that dude
[6:04:23] Runescale: Dude when you stream for 10 hours and talk politics all day every day ofc it's drains you mentally
[6:04:26] stilljane: service industry will drain you physically and mentally over the years, but i love it.
[6:04:31] Blastmindx: i dont like hasan either but that particular thing was taken out of context 100%
[6:04:38] Roxxybolts: I’m gonna be honest I know for a fact I will always have job security with how dumb these kids are now LUL
[6:04:38] foxyllama: i blame andrew tate hes exposing the cooked ones, i love that guy
[6:04:38] rembrandt89: social media influencers are frying brains on the daily
[6:04:39] dewwy_o: worked mental health for years, nicest kind of people. Its the normal that is crazy
[6:04:39] zachgamegodx: @Runescale he doesnt do it all day

[6:05:38] addyz0r: chat: Where do I get water as a healer?
[6:05:40] Badasti: problem is people use mental health as an excuse to be complete assholes too
[6:05:40] nikthevoker: people are soft
[6:05:42] nightmxz: Some people just love being miserable, and anything that breaks up their misery is even more miserable
[6:05:44] Kymagez: you better not...
[6:05:47] stilljane: @Badasti omg i cannot stand that
[6:05:48] Garthd: that was very offensive
[6:05:54] Krykoda: u think echo only won cuz running dh which is op rn, as always?

[6:06:08] SteLawBro: I think this conversation has traumatized me.
[6:06:12] Vigi9413: i think there are people who actually just enjoy being mad
[6:06:15] rembrandt89: call them what they are ven
[6:06:29] Roxxybolts: I accidentally said yes sir to a “ma’am” because I’m a distinguished southern gentlemen and boy oh boy I got in so much trouble.
[6:06:34] Robohobbo: I want Echo to lose so I can finally say that they are an echo of what they used to be
[6:06:34] kusoneko: Both are true
[6:06:39] skez_live: playing the meta is kinda a winning strategy so :D
[6:06:41] zachgamegodx: its the genz thing to get mad over everythign
[6:06:43] lmeno: You know what else is Meta? The tunes Ven is playing. Loving it <3
[6:06:52] ALLtheEXP: @Roxxybolts did you apologize to him?
[6:06:52] Magottx: I’m upset you’re not upset /anger
[6:06:52] stilljane: most restaurant jobs you cannot say "thanks guys" "or hey guys"
[6:06:55] lilknarcyon: That echo question was so copium......destro is also op not just dh
[6:06:59] nikthevoker: @Roxxybolts thats a DUCK and COVER situation
[6:07:08] Kymagez: ?
[6:07:16] Cocoapuffs1: People can't agree on fundamental facts of life
[6:07:18] SteLawBro: I swear the only negative interactions i have are with people online. When i walk out into the real world its nothing but great.
[6:07:20] ginyu_music: more than what?
[6:07:21] zachgamegodx: gen z people unironically threaten friends and family that they'll stop being their friends if they don't speak out about x issue on social media
[6:07:27] stilljane: @SteLawBro yeah i can agree with that lol
[6:07:36] Magottx: @stilljane LA has to be so bad with that stuff now

[6:08:20] strafekey: this is THE BEST
[6:08:25] Robohobbo: I belieb
[6:08:25] peeachy8: i believe
[6:08:28] W00dyyx: 2 priests battling for Vens heart
[6:08:31] strafekey: I belieb
[6:08:37] Vigi9413: i'm not a good people person but i find it way easier to have conversations on twitch
[6:08:40] lilknarcyon: I think it's a /exit angle tbh
[6:08:42] stilljane: retail might be worse than restaurant work. you get paid HORRIBLE money and deal wit the worst people.
[6:09:01] Magottx: They’re not even physical anyways right
[6:09:25] rembrandt89: do not fuck with restaurant workers ive watched waiting
[6:09:47] Magottx: @stilljane AND have to convince them to buy stuff if you’re sales retail. Sales at Best Buy was awful
[6:10:13] Vigi9413: A friend of mine told me something yesterday and i think it might be true... i've been alive 30 years almost and i don't think i've ever seen a chinese food commercial lol
[6:10:49] legiontheworgen: @Vigi9413 oh you know what now that i think about it i haven't either
[6:10:55] SteLawBro: No ads but yoou have 40 of their menuss on top of the fridge lol
[6:11:04] lilknarcyon: At least in the restaurant people's shitty behavior is limited by the fact that their face is attached to their actions. On twitch it's all anonymous. I don't mind service industry one bit
[6:11:16] skez_live: @Vigi9413 in China those are just called Food commercials
[6:11:35] rembrandt89: lol

[6:15:17] Magottx: Bros getting kinda goated on the lock can’t lie
[6:17:59] raymaann: they were all melting
[6:18:10] Robohobbo: Venruki at the start:" you think I can win this?" now 3/3 wins
[6:18:13] Robohobbo: jesus
[6:19:20] zachgamegodx: @Robohobbo he's like batman

[6:23:35] koonakeenay: like insanely clear just the dot alone will do like 3-4% extra free damage
[6:23:50] koonakeenay: and then the numbers being higher, ui was JW because the glad wep is like an extra 4% vers
[6:24:11] drfeltgood: @koonakeenay I had the same Questions tbh.

[6:30:28] addyz0r: set > weap
[6:30:52] Blastmindx: it's mr. solo shuffle himself

[6:33:11] 34chev: how do you target your team mates as a healer
[6:33:12] storm_chaser_ron: jesus christ 7200 games
[6:34:03] Runescale: I don't want to play my healer even though I am below 1k raiting
