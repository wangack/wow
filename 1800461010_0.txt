[3:54:38] Mecabeast: you cant be a tank/heals/meta dps for retail hard core imo
[3:54:57] Snabido: Anduin looking directly at the Light was pretty hardcore in the bfa cinematic
[3:55:28] TheLoho: Oof, a level 52 death. That's a tilter
[3:55:41] freddy_fazbearrr: Was it iron man rules as well for retail with hardcore?
[3:55:42] Holyryze: yea i wanna see DH lol

[3:56:15] Cello_73: they had to have aggrod other mobs but the flayer is what killed them
[3:56:25] adxx: I think their should be an ilvl cap set. Like 400 ilvl for whole group and try to push 21-22’s. It makes the gear min-maxing interesting and makes the overall dungeon runs just harder with lower stars
[3:56:41] manmower: you should design a challenge specifically so you can win it yourself, learned this one trick to be cool back in grade school
[3:56:48] Starryskys: Are they neutral in classic ? I thought they weren't back then

[4:22:57] Ezcotli: Miami
[4:22:58] bugcatcher19: he almost 39 i think
[4:23:25] Mostdangspy: I dont think you can judge just based on rings. Thats all Steph has compared Lebron
[4:23:25] CDubTheRIPper: NODDERS
[4:23:28] burrddy: Wouldn't stat padding in a professional sport be just playing your game good? lmao
[4:23:29] EpicJune: He padding dem meters KEKW
[4:23:36] Xirmak: no
[4:23:52] mavericks312: @Mostdangspy what else matters in sports other then championships?
[4:23:55] Molvonos: Hot takes with weird/no reasoning.
[4:23:57] CDubTheRIPper: i guess you could throw steph and klay in there with all their 3s KEKW
[4:23:58] lurker198: if only the other team would stop stat padding we could beat them
[4:24:02] sipilde: DSPin' that ball man
[4:24:05] DunzoCD: stat padding is emmit smith playing after he sucked just to make his #1 rushing number higher lol

[4:25:19] Mostdangspy: @mavericks312 Its a team sport. You can't compare individual talent based on the teams they were on. In that sense Bill Russell would be the GOAT of all time
