[1:55:13] Feegar: i still miss wow
[1:55:55] Feegar: im your next main healer u will see Kappa
[1:56:20] chewytowel: Sco are you in the super secret TWW alpha?
[1:56:37] chewytowel: FeelsBadMan
[1:57:02] loweery: jaja
[1:57:13] Feegar: this answer gives me a "yes" feeling :D
[1:57:25] okok28: @eatsleeprepeatx if I was to make a guild from scratch these days, I would probs start with pugging M+, find some decent consistent solo players and start a guild with them and try to build from there
[1:57:54] loweery: ha
[1:58:02] loweery: you mean poch people
[1:58:29] eatsleeprepeatx: @okok28 i see i see
[1:58:33] sputzke: what do you feel about boost communities?
[1:58:36] Feegar: how can a alpha beeing super secret, if "random peoples" knows about it? LUL
[1:58:44] sputzke: helpful or harmful to wow
[1:58:45] sputzke: ?
[2:00:16] sputzke: I have been managing guilds since vanilla and for my take RMT oriented boost communities are damaging the community vibe at some point since it individualize people
[2:00:25] sputzke: to just go solo boosting etc
[2:00:33] sputzke: Many activities are now revolving around boosting
[2:01:13] sputzke: However it might also be one of the reasons why wow survives compared to short seasoned games ie. diablo
[2:01:41] sputzke: I see thanks
[2:01:41] Feegar: diablo is not that good since d3 imo

[2:03:16] chewytowel: monkaHmm Is Method going super hard next raid tier or is Season 4 a meh season?
[2:03:33] chewytowel: ok
[2:04:04] Feegar: next expansion u do all world firsts i trust in u :p
[2:04:28] chewytowel: You could make it so if not in your guild you don't get mounts or achievements
[2:04:38] chewytowel: and add in a cd for inviting new members
[2:05:02] chewytowel: It'd still be annoying imo
[2:05:26] kieranmh1995: does that not stop pug groups doing runs as well though?
[2:05:45] Feegar: is it the game or ur pc? :D i was wondering about your 50-54 fps in open world
[2:05:48] Itankarenas: my fps has been shit since tuesday
[2:05:48] chewytowel: PuGs don't deserve AOTC or mounts!  Disgusting!
[2:05:51] Coffeeguru: Sell junk
[2:06:07] tripl3heart: farm old transmog items
[2:06:11] chewytowel: You can make gold doing all the gold missions on all your alts
[2:06:13] Feegar: Advertise gr :D
[2:06:14] chewytowel: not too much tho
[2:06:16] sputzke: Then there is the second question. Those who are buying boosts... How do THEY get the gold then?
[2:06:20] sputzke: Farming herbs?
[2:06:27] n1451: since they unified the auction house it's difficult to earn gold by selling herbs
[2:06:36] sputzke: Legit
[2:06:40] sputzke: =)
[2:06:44] chewytowel: Some make a lot of gold from tips apparently
[2:06:45] kieranmh1995: why donâ€™t they chewy? so people who have come back to the game after a break if the guild is mythic running and you want HC you shouldnâ€™t get AOTC because itâ€™s not guild run?
[2:07:14] chewytowel: @kieranmh1995 Exactly!
[2:07:26] tripl3heart: Farm old transmog items and wait for right times to sell, also some items sell well during start of xpacs or seasons
[2:07:40] kieranmh1995: so basically new players shouldnâ€™t get AOTC?
[2:07:51] chewytowel: Never they should be on probation
[2:08:10] chewytowel: Sorry I'm waking up my trolling is a little bad atm
[2:08:25] kieranmh1995: why would new players come to the game then?
[2:08:36] Itankarenas: best slideshow Iâ€™ve seen in a while
[2:08:42] Ch4rm0s14n: i make my gold from running old raids
[2:08:51] chewytowel: Is that still very viable?
[2:08:53] Itankarenas: wow.ppt
[2:09:41] chewytowel: I thought they heavily nerfed all the gold from legacy raids
[2:10:34] sputzke: buon apetito
[2:10:38] sputzke: have a nice evening
