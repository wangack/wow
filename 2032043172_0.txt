[2:59:24] Cybernytez: idk man hpal getting cct is bad Sac got nerfed really big to only 20% dam reduce and bop doesnt do shit vs casters and u have no hots and what else
[2:59:42] dawsonator171: chuck, you're dead AF with 2 hpriest.
[2:59:49] Kymagez: ibs?
[2:59:53] pietyhs: happy Saturday night cdew I noticed you never have music playing in streams, do you have a preferred genre?
[3:00:03] Frostyjoneslol: @Cybernytez u can still play big sac, bop is the same its always been, glimmer is a pretty decent hot lol
[3:00:24] Cybernytez: thing is if u dont fake cast on hpal and get interrupted u almost autolose insta and u are very not tanky when gettin trained as well bc u have to cast
[3:01:38] Frostyjoneslol: @Cybernytez thats like most healers if u get int except druid. I can name like 6 instant cast u can use to heal urself
[3:01:52] waffleberryx: oh no did they double swap
[3:01:55] waffleberryx: hate to see it
[3:02:01] FoxiekittenWoW: @Cybernytez dno its not what the ladder is saying tbh, they are no druid, but looking at ladder and shuffle they seem to be the second best healer right now
[3:02:26] Cybernytez: shuffle ladder maybe ^^ but where are all the hpals in 3s on the top xD
[3:02:37] FoxiekittenWoW: look at the eu ladder
[3:02:43] FoxiekittenWoW: there are alot of hpals
[3:03:37] Frostyjoneslol: @Cybernytez there at 3 in the top 100 on NA

[3:04:29] Cybernytez: idk if 3 hpals out of 100 slots is a good representation
[3:04:33] Frostyjoneslol: This is the same argument u see when people look at logs, everything gets inflated becuz players dont play things they feel is inferior even if its not by much.
[3:04:43] dawsonator171: so good when they can't stop the bolts.
[3:04:50] Cybernytez: and on eu its 6 hpals but
[3:04:54] dawsonator171: I retract my prior statement.
[3:05:04] Cybernytez: doesnt really tell me its good
[3:05:05] DizziestShot: spell steal is so annoying
[3:05:07] Frostyjoneslol: Im not saying Hpal is gods gift to pvp healing right now, buts its not bad either nor dog water tier
[3:05:23] itz_killjoy: what a good lobby for a destro , damn ur lucky
[3:05:51] Cybernytez: idk man i played my hpal and for me its not it
[3:05:56] ChilledsDogTreats: no immo on dk pet?
[3:06:07] Cybernytez: maybe some people can have success with it but there were way better times on ot
[3:06:14] Cybernytez: it*
[3:06:50] atoker: !macros
[3:07:24] Frostyjoneslol: There are way better times for every class lol hpals biggest downfall right now is mana control if you go againts a heavy dam comp, u will oom. They have TONS of CD's to trade which makes them inherently tanky
[3:07:37] Cybernytez: i rather play my disc and i have way more fun on it
[3:08:08] Frostyjoneslol: I mean i get it fotm classes are fun cuz they do well
[3:08:21] Frostyjoneslol: why u see all the zug zug 4head dh's lol
[3:08:23] Cybernytez: disc isnt the best either but still better than hpal imo
[3:08:27] EFFSIN: solo shuffle looks fun with priests
[3:08:39] FoxiekittenWoW: fun and good is two different things, but if you think disc is better than pala i dont knwo
[3:08:44] exizt_01: double hpriest lobby
[3:08:46] exizt_01: unheard of
[3:09:30] Cybernytez: disc has thrash tier but i actually think its better than hpal
[3:09:30] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:10:20] FoxiekittenWoW: maybe you are just better disc then, but in general they are not
[3:10:26] Frostyjoneslol: @Cybernytez well then by ur logic there are only 2 disc in the top 100 3v3
[3:10:59] FoxiekittenWoW: 1 disc in top 100 on eu
[3:11:25] brewtank: 2 hpriests lol
[3:11:43] Cybernytez: only bc there are 2 disc and 3 hpals in NA top 100 u wanan tell me that figures which one is better ?
[3:11:44] Frostyjoneslol: we should all go buy lottery tickets getting 2 hpriest in the same solo shuffle
[3:12:15] sh3ikmustafa: yo is kalvish a r1?
[3:12:16] Cybernytez: for me disc is betetr ok
[3:12:43] FoxiekittenWoW: yea thats fine disc is also better for me

[3:21:30] Frostyjoneslol: i wouldnt use gloves
[3:21:43] Frostyjoneslol: i skipped gloves
[3:21:51] Elmozez: Cause of the beacon talent where you always benefit from full mastery

[3:24:04] Cybernytez: bop needs anerf ? lmao thats the funniest thing ive ever heard ^^ it can be purged wich almost everx class in the game can do and it can be mded and shattered as well, on top of that its useless vs every caster and even vs some melees than not only do melee dmg ^^ mages can spellsteal it etc etc
[3:24:12] feldoggo: damn just tabbd out and come back lol, why did you do the spells on the action bar? is there an addon to it? to copy from alts?
[3:24:40] Frostyjoneslol: @Laythos i think hpal has enough throughput through CD's crit helps with mana
