[1:24:02] alantin77: yea i wasn't expecting the SOD its out of left field so good they are trying new things
[1:24:18] neftario105: Im going warrior Human then
[1:24:30] xAcidElfx: im so excited for shaman tank finally

[1:24:44] EKS90_: im making a paladin, warrior and warlock, my 3 favourite classes. paladin been my main for 19 years so.
[1:24:49] SirTedric: wouldnt "classic + retail" just be the starting zone of retail? im confused whats gonna be hyped about it lol not to down talk just trying to understand it
[1:24:53] neftario105: I'm tire of playing Hunter lol
[1:25:05] Krait06: With the exp boost itll be easy to lvl
[1:25:09] SirTedric: i main druid lol so curious how thats gonna turn out in SoD

[1:25:17] Decree22: i always wanted survival to be a tank spec lol
[1:25:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I've heard people say hundreds of times over the years that they wanted a real shaman tank
[1:25:34] neftario105: true
[1:25:59] Krait06: Theyre complaining that SoD is going too far
[1:26:02] Buttscratchrr: SOD will be the future of wow  their main apple sauce watch BCWarrior
[1:26:02] Nevindaz: they want the vanilla exp.. specif no sys changes, talents
[1:26:13] SirTedric: is there limitations in sod with the abilities or is it a free for all on all classes?
[1:26:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I always said that there is a place in the game for a tank that wears mail, like the shammy
[1:26:30] xAcidElfx: LOL so true tho
[1:26:31] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:26:33] Krait06: yeah true
[1:26:41] EKS90_: That is 100% one reason, the hate between classic and retail players are so idiotic
[1:26:41] drippyschlongstocking: i think classic is attracting wow noobs
[1:26:41] Decree22: bingo
[1:26:50] McReubenn: i feel like theres not as many people upset as most people think
[1:26:54] Masqerader: i hate classic, i hate retail - Blizzard you fools not matter what you like its $$$$
[1:26:55] SirTedric: DING
[1:26:57] nezz231: gz
[1:27:03] Masqerader: *no
[1:27:12] Buttscratchrr: why can't we all just get along!
[1:27:22] drippyschlongstocking: bg3 was the gateway drug to wow this year
[1:27:22] Krait06: They'll all be there the 30th leveing riding the hype
[1:27:47] SamboNZ: i just dont get why 'classic' Cata is happening and will replace Wratch =( at least leave us with a perm Wrath Era server?
[1:27:49] SirTedric: whats cap ?
[1:27:50] Broomba: It’s like new streamers going to moon guard and hijacking the RP in the inn @towelliee
[1:27:53] Masqerader: @Buttscratchrr it's mostly just a small group of players no matter what you released would complain
[1:27:54] SirTedric: 60 still?
[1:28:31] ArcaneSyntax: Right now the classic sub is big mad 2h enhance is being left in the dust.
[1:28:58] xAcidElfx: its funny to me, that people are so die hard retail/CataProg/classic era, ect  bhecause i love all of thbem hahahahaha
[1:29:02] SamboNZ: yeh i guess =(
[1:29:06] Thicc_Fil_A: game needs a reset

[1:29:17] xALcaPWNedx: They really want a marvel multiverse of wow - and bringing back iron man … I mean lmfao
[1:29:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was a little sad that some wanted to stay in Burning Crusade but couldn't, but it would be a lot of resources for few players

[1:29:29] ImjustBatin: i got bored of wrath
[1:29:29] Masqerader: not having lfd from that start didn't help it
[1:29:30] ArcaneSyntax: No dungeon finder killed it
[1:29:32] xAcidElfx: really? its insanely populated
[1:29:38] Landon72: Wraith died quick
[1:29:40] 1nsaynCoffee: If they try Classic WoD! We RIOT!!!!
[1:29:41] EKS90_: nothing would be bigger than Vanilla.
[1:29:48] trivotix: hands down hurt them
[1:29:50] Landon72: atleast my realm
[1:29:56] Morpheusx25: @1nsaynCoffee oh they prob will lol
[1:30:12] jfdesign: just finished presumably my last heroic sark run before season 3 and no lego for my evoker.. feelsbad
[1:30:20] Masqerader: @1nsaynCoffee other than the lack of world content, dungeons and raids in WOD were pretty good
[1:30:20] Rabbi19: That’s exactly why I didn’t play. Wanted the dungeon finder.
[1:30:26] ArcaneSyntax: I would've played way more at release if they had dungeon finder.
[1:30:48] EKS90_: I wanted dungeon finder, but i dont want raid finder
[1:30:50] xAcidElfx: LFR will kill cata

[1:31:22] VenutianSpring: i dont think lfr was the real problem it was the entire dragon soul tier
[1:32:15] trivotix: The GS bs just killed things. People wanted stupid high gear score to do things that did not need it. Was a waste
[1:32:36] willy_billy_silly: how many times have you died on hardcore
[1:33:07] goldiesoulo: did you used to smoke before vaping ? im thinking of taking up vaping to quit smoking lol
[1:33:09] Broomba: Dem meta players
[1:33:10] Masqerader: no rdf, lack of players for end game and mindless gdkp, fun times in wrath
[1:33:12] Eminim97: thats why you que with a friend and than you can never get kicked lol
[1:33:26] willy_billy_silly: oh
[1:33:32] Geeds__: how many years have you streamed this game now
[1:33:48] brentosxd: Yeah like i'm getting my parses checked everytime i try to pug a 15y old raid like im trying to join a mythic raid or smth lol
[1:33:51] Masqerader: lucky 13
[1:34:10] theDirtyon3: almost 4 decades man thats wild at one company
[1:34:23] npringel: would much rather see no Cata classic and see them focus all efforts into Classic SoD and future Classic content but that's just me...

[1:35:09] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @rockman7654321 (warning)
[1:35:12] EKS90_: @npringel yeah I mean I agree, but with the survey they probablyt judged enough people wanted it.
[1:35:14] Masqerader: it's funny because I pug a lot when my group isn't around during our usual key times and I haven't had an issues with getting into keys
[1:35:22] neftario105: FFXIV have toxic player and ESO too
[1:35:25] Metsu83: "if given the chance players will optimize the fun out of a game"
[1:35:25] goldiesoulo: any social media, including video games if you think about it, are a breeding ground for negativity
[1:35:25] Masqerader: on top of that you can't get declined if u run ur own key
[1:35:31] VenutianSpring: people will be toxic until tech exists to separate them from everyone else
[1:35:33] WallyW4: So is it best to just play for the story lfg and rfg?
[1:35:47] Geeds__: find a chill guild ^
[1:36:28] GodTheMechanic: The game doesn't make the community, the community makes the game. People seemed to think that playing older versions the same way they play the newer ones would bring back the old school feel

[1:37:05] Endin: old as dirt feelsbadman
[1:37:07] Masqerader: I think a lot of toxic bs especially with keys could be alleviated if the got rid of key deplete and made keystones, just have the dungeon on it, and have a drop down menu like d3 and u just run the key level on w/e level u choose from your highest current and below
[1:37:14] oldmanmetal: When the gear score addon was introduced back in WotLK...what a shitshow.
[1:37:16] veryhairyheyyall: towel ty for streaming!! im hyped for next week too
[1:37:16] WallyW4: The only nice people I have ran into have been in hardcore which I believe is because there are only 2 servers and ppl don’t want a bad rep

[1:38:42] BfAleTitan: wrath was definitely the start of gear gating groups
[1:38:56] EKS90_: this is how GS worked in vanilla wow " come to bridge in Ironforge for inspection" LUL I remember.
[1:38:57] oldmanmetal: In Vanilla you got inspected before you could join raid guilds. Understandable.
[1:39:10] snarlins: Well back then no transmog you could see and know if they had good gear
[1:39:16] Buttscratchrr: another level of all classic wow  Andy's
[1:39:18] Grotesko80: There wasn't any great MMO back then. Nobody know what they were doing really, so it's was alright to not be optimal.
[1:39:28] willy_billy_silly: for casual raiding in WoW retail it still takes a while
[1:39:30] neftario105: true
[1:39:36] Cross_Contour: @Towelliee you think thats bad try get 60 man raids when everquest was out LUL
[1:39:38] mechos: remember Thottbot :)

[1:41:04] GodTheMechanic: You knew by looking at the people in the cool looking hear on Ironforge bridge betweny he bank and AH
[1:41:05] Masqerader: there was this shaman on my server named zeus and he went over honor cap back in vanilla... his ass got blacklisted no guild or honor team would touch him lol
[1:41:13] jfdesign: last heroic sark kill before seaseon 3.. no evoker lego.. feelsbadman
[1:41:32] EKS90_: im still playing the same paladin, so it was just a matter of talking and we kinda had some stories from back then.
[1:41:44] Buttscratchrr: crossrealm change alot
[1:41:56] mechos: Cannot even describe the feeling when you finally figured out how and got into Molten Core - it was like wowzaaa!!
[1:42:02] oldmanmetal: I as a Hunter back then had to go prove that I could pull mobs and kit them around before I could join the guild I applied to.
[1:42:02] ArcaneSyntax: Sod has gotta be doing some talent and class stuff outside of just runes right?

[1:43:36] Masqerader: 40 man scholomance
[1:43:37] MaRcuSCheVz: yea that would be sick
[1:43:41] Masqerader: 40 man strat
[1:43:48] MaRcuSCheVz: I hope its good
[1:43:49] Kwurky: 40 man Dire Maul could be cool. It's big enough for that many.
[1:44:06] ArcaneSyntax: I hope they nuke the shaman 2h talent from orbit
[1:44:12] brentosxd: The amount of creativity the team can show is crazy, hope they arent afraid
[1:44:16] Masqerader: 6,000,000 crusader orbs drop from 40 man strat, market dies

[1:44:41] oldmanmetal: *annoying
[1:45:24] oldmanmetal: Yep
[1:45:34] Masqerader: ya
[1:45:47] EKS90_: In vanilla wow, I was in aa AQ40 clearing guild and i pugged a lot too, so that is why this guild remembered me ^^ I was very active.
[1:45:59] EKS90_: and I will always be greatful they still played and I got invited.
[1:46:12] PulsarCologne: i cant wait to play boomkin in classic SoD XD
[1:46:19] EKS90_: They said yes to that
[1:46:24] Buttscratchrr: They said Ultra slow
[1:46:26] Nevindaz: turtle wow have cool zones and dungeons like mount hyjal, gilneas, isles but the problem is the client is the 1.12 version and is very buggy and clunky
[1:46:29] heropepsi: idrop
[1:46:33] GodKingMuninn: We'll just kill a lot faster
[1:46:33] Velanthos: it will, especially being gated leveling throughout
[1:46:52] EKS90_: @GodKingMuninn They are buffing the open world to still be hard.
[1:46:53] Masqerader: How 40 man UBRS will go down "make raid, summon everyone, hand out food, buff everyone"  hype everyone up with fight music by eminem... "who has key"  *crickets* 40 people hearth
[1:47:16] oldmanmetal: haha

[1:49:07] llamatodd: you made it into the guild Pog

[1:52:18] llamatodd: that hilton was packed, probably patient 0 in there
[1:52:43] Mortuno: tangMask
[1:52:58] EKS90_: @Buttscratchrr I just don't agree with SoD being 1 last chance for something, there is still the entire trilogy of retail going soon, etc.
[1:53:29] EKS90_: they could announce some other classic thing and people would play that too.
[1:54:10] Kwurky: Saturday night was nuts with the show over at 7:00PM plus the Marines.

[3:21:36] notColt45: Lost ark just got a reaper class too
[3:21:38] Sathalan: EW relics yes
[3:21:40] anxietyrising: all the manderville quests from back in 2.0 til current, but yes
[3:21:47] Fynale: you have to do EVERY EXPANSION's set of manderville quests as a prereq to do the relics
[3:21:51] Rudric_Ice: this is how big scythes and 2handed swords should look like FUCKING HUGE
[3:21:54] Arkangel_I: Yes at the current stage, 1 more stage left to finish them
[3:22:01] Fynale: no
[3:22:05] Fynale: MULTIPLE EXPANSIONS WORTH
[3:22:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: you have to become a manderville man
[3:22:16] Fynale: like 15 patches worth
[3:22:20] tlsmith3638: oh yea hildibrand is needed
[3:22:28] mitchyy2: yeah it's lengthy but could do it in a day
[3:22:30] anxietyrising: its a side quest chain from every expansion, all comedy stuff
[3:22:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: these are worth watching
[3:22:49] Morpheusx25: @anxietyrising every xpac except for shadowbringers
[3:22:56] EKS90_: Manderville is a must see if you do it
[3:22:58] EKS90_: for sure
[3:22:58] Fynale: apperently it's really good
[3:23:13] tlsmith3638: hildibrand is pretty cool it like a wacky mystery show
[3:23:15] Sathalan: manderville quests are almost all story. worth a read through
[3:23:17] Morpheusx25: manderville is comedy gold
[3:23:40] anxietyrising: @Morpheusx25 right
[3:23:56] Sathalan: the raid stories for EW were good too
[3:24:01] EKS90_: I stopped playing ff14, but did the firrst parts of manderville questlines, they are 100% worth every damn watch and read @Towelliee like 100% for suuure.
[3:24:24] Arkangel_I: Yea the first time I saw ffxiv was when you streamed Stormblood launch.
[3:24:31] Sathalan: I, personally, can't stand the manderville quests humor
[3:25:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: after they burned me in 1.0 it took heavensward for me to come back
[3:25:31] akia03: just the degen playerbase sucks in ff14
[3:25:53] Breakernaut: don't you have to go up to the troll village?
[3:25:57] anxietyrising: Ultimates would definitely test your mettle, the rest I think would get old quick for you
[3:26:01] TheUnknowing: I love ff14 but i definitely have issues sticking with it, especially when there is WoW. I typically play for a few months and drop it for awhile, so on so forth.

[3:27:38] anxietyrising: In a perfect world, the FF14 seasons and the WoW seasons would not overlap
[3:27:42] Nevindaz: they added an aproppiate vers of m+ criterion dungeon in this patch
[3:27:46] Sathalan: I imagine mythic raiding on its own is super stressful at times

[3:28:20] Nevindaz: bshit
[3:28:22] Nevindaz: KEKW
[3:28:34] Nevindaz: and a mount
[3:28:43] xhighpaulx: I thought pally was banned in onlyfangs
[3:28:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Endwalker definitely started strong

[3:28:53] Cyenna: whats the best tank for the war within
[3:28:58] Jarlan23: they didnt add a gridy endgame system like they usually do
[3:29:00] Jarlan23: is what i heard
[3:29:09] anxietyrising: its just the end of the expansion burn out
[3:29:10] Rudric_Ice: its not just zepla is bascially all FF creators
[3:29:13] Nevindaz: yea cus Yoshi was way to focused on ff16 for sure and some devs from ff14
[3:29:14] EKS90_: I think it depends on what you do in the game, I have a friend who still plays everyday has done for over 2 years now, doing guild events and server events etc
[3:29:20] illuminate90: @xhighpaulx Pretty sure that was just for Esfand cause he only plays it
[3:29:21] Sathalan: I'm pretty sure they're meant to be an optional for fun challenge tho, not a way to gear
[3:29:33] Nevindaz: yea like Eureka, Bozhja
[3:29:41] Nevindaz: for midcore aud
[3:29:45] Nevindaz: player
[3:29:55] anxietyrising: They already have plans for more midcore stuff in Dawntrail though
[3:30:08] Nevindaz: Eureka it takes too long
[3:30:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah eureka was not fun to me
[3:30:20] xhighpaulx: @illuminate90 prob cuz he only plays ret
[3:30:52] Sathalan: I'd rather shit in my hands and clap than go back into eureka or bozja
[3:31:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: you fell asleep for shadowbringers
[3:31:06] anxietyrising: too many spoilers man!
[3:31:38] Menion01: Nobody who plays FFXIV WATCHED FFXIV at launch because they don't want the story spoiled. THey watch after they finish the MSQ because they can see the reaction.
[3:31:42] Arkangel_I: Oh yea no one watches at launch. Everyone is playing
[3:31:50] Jarlan23: story is the only reason i played ff14. after i finished it i quit

[3:32:27] Jarlan23: what were ur viewers like for swtor? thats a story heavy game
[3:32:39] Jarlan23: or atleast it was. but i guess swtor had like 8 stories in it
[3:32:39] anxietyrising: We are an odd bunch
[3:32:51] mitchyy2: i'd watch, my ADHD doesnt let me watch ff14 cutscenes, way too long and i lose focus lmaoo
[3:33:01] mitchyy2: I'd rather listen to someone play through while i skip the scenes
[3:33:15] AdamCbass: swtor is a great game. ive played it since launch
[3:33:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: i mean we had swtor beta spioilers going into it
[3:33:21] AdamCbass: on and off
[3:33:23] Breakernaut: I think people who play SWTOR are more like WoW players than FF14
[3:33:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: ff14 we know nothing at launch
[3:33:40] Arkangel_I: Smart
[3:33:46] kingg3d: no one cared for swtor story
[3:33:52] notColt45: drops maybe
[3:33:54] hypoxic_za: Swtor is a great single player game now.

[3:34:02] abracka_: he walks out and you can run in
[3:34:03] Breakernaut: It'll be dicy but probably fine
[3:34:09] Ewol66: he patrols out
[3:34:28] notColt45: raid boss engaged

[3:35:08] notColt45: forget how big fiery is
[3:35:42] notColt45: viper looks sick
[3:35:43] Arkangel_I: Warrior is OP this expansion
[3:35:46] Nevindaz: warrior is the most fun
[3:35:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: warriors pretty op last i heard
[3:35:56] xendros78: warrior
[3:36:00] anxietyrising: really isnt any at this point
[3:36:01] TheUnknowing: warrior has been my main since launch so

[3:37:49] anxietyrising: New melee job, dual swords
[3:37:50] Sathalan: New melee dps
[3:37:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: viper is a dual sword wielding that connects them together like a darth maul saber
[3:38:11] anxietyrising: gubnreaker was a brand new job, was not in ff11
[3:38:21] Arkangel_I: the last 3 jobs that they added are all new concepts
[3:38:25] xendros78: yep, viper reminds of the jedi sentinel/sith marauder from SWTOR
[3:38:48] anxietyrising: no idea, 11 was not my kind of game
[3:39:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: it breaks everytime they do a major patch so not worth using
[3:39:33] abracka_: you can get banned for using any mod in XIV
[3:39:34] Tebatusasula42069: @Towelliee actually crazy how bad the WoW UI is even after the "big" update
[3:39:35] Nevindaz: Kappa

[3:39:45] Tebatusasula42069: 0 customisabilty

[3:40:57] neugassh: Everybody uses gshade
