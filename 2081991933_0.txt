[0:14:56] heymomimonttv: i have a hard enough time remembering other birthdays, half the time i dont even realize mine is coming up
[0:15:02] heymomimonttv: that weap is cool af tho
[0:15:03] Slunkss: !song
[0:15:04] Nightbot: Enable the AHA Music Identifier to find out the song! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aha-music-music-identifie/dpacanjfikmhoddligfbehkpomnbgblf?hl=en
[0:15:18] zachgamegodx: so i watched the poddyc, i figured we'd watch it on stream so i didnt bother going past 15 mins
[0:15:21] heymomimonttv: journey rips
[0:15:23] Luigicamp: I have all their albums
[0:15:38] heymomimonttv: and the crazy thing is they've had so many different singers that have mostly all been awesome
[0:15:54] heymomimonttv: yea he is
[0:15:58] heymomimonttv: and is way younger than them
[0:16:29] checkemcharles: does it make you realize how much of a dork you sound like
[0:16:44] zachgamegodx: what was the most interesting topic u did?
[0:17:08] wowsuomi: Noone likes hearing there own voice
[0:17:08] Slunkss: absolutely
[0:17:23] zachgamegodx: yes, if u ever play with whaazz he'll get bad imprsesion of u without that
[0:17:25] zachgamegodx: you heard him last time
[0:17:25] heymomimonttv: i wish the arms 4 set bonus wasn;t so gimped
[0:17:41] Bwrecker: I really like the 4 set
[0:17:43] heymomimonttv: the execute bleed is severely nerfed in pvp
[0:17:51] NightMunchies: ikr!
[0:17:54] Secretwombatbro: yeah but its a free clap
[0:17:57] zachgamegodx: its the free rend application on execute that's nice @heymomimonttv
[0:17:58] shugguls: not as good as season 1 or 2
[0:18:00] Secretwombatbro: that applies rend for free
[0:18:00] NightMunchies: i like the 4th set
[0:18:16] heymomimonttv: yea i like the free rend i just wish that 50% bleed worked somewhat lol
[0:18:21] suspicious94: for 3k health?
[0:18:27] zachgamegodx: it's overall a meh tier set since execute isn't really hititng mroe than mortal strike and mortal strike is up every 3.2 seconds or resets
[0:18:33] NightMunchies: bonus on warrior is good for Arms
[0:18:34] zachgamegodx: but it's worth using, good stats
[0:18:40] akaYidus: that belt enchant is the most stupid thing I seen in a while
[0:18:45] akaYidus: so expensive for shit stat
[0:18:55] heymomimonttv: yea
[0:18:58] Bwrecker: I have yes
[0:19:05] fredscoop: yee
[0:19:05] zachgamegodx: @akaYidus stam isn't shit
[0:19:06] NightMunchies: i have
[0:19:07] shugguls: @zachgamegodx agree , was disappointed in it
[0:19:09] Luigicamp: the 1984 one? yes
[0:19:17] akaYidus: @zachgamegodx depends on the class I guess
[0:19:19] heymomimonttv: i thought dune 1 was boring af and have seen it a few times. everyone says dune 2 was way better
[0:19:25] Crucaider: It's fantastic, both parts
[0:19:32] Bwrecker: I really liked dune and dune 2
[0:19:33] nikthevoker: sup @venruki howsit going man
[0:19:38] StromicusRex: i had a hard time following it, but i did enjoy it. friends and i are actually gonna rewatch it soon so we can watch the new one
[0:19:47] Crucaider: You've got bad movie friends
[0:19:48] cinnabooms: venruki boring confirmed?
[0:19:54] fredscoop: cause its hard to keep up with
[0:19:58] sleightxyz: hello ven!
[0:20:12] tangell0s: @venruki i cannot believe this expansion is this close to being over and Blizzard hasn't released a duck mount
[0:20:16] fredscoop: second one more than first
[0:20:17] fredscoop: both good
[0:20:18] NightMunchies: dune the older 1 was way better i think
[0:20:20] wackpoetic: I feel like if you didn't know the original story it can be a little hard to follow. It's also more of an atmospheric vibe
[0:20:22] zachgamegodx: @shugguls execute gets watered down bc of the fact that sudden death exists then they have an execute set so sudden death is procing all the time so ofc they're not gonna make execute hit hard but man if execute hit hard it would be awesome
[0:20:23] cinnabooms: i never watched dune 1 i thought no one did either lol
[0:20:24] Luigicamp: if they think that's slow, try recommending them 2001 A Space Odyssey LuL
[0:20:38] Luigicamp: I loved it
[0:20:42] zachgamegodx: if they removed sudden death and execute was 35 and under and amped hte dmg warrior would be so much m ore fun
[0:20:48] Bwrecker: I'm older so maybe thats why
[0:20:53] NightMunchies: dune 1984
[0:21:08] Imahackerone: Dune 1 is basically setup for Dune 2 but overall is amazing insane graphics and all
[0:21:40] heymomimonttv: @zachgamegodx i wish execute hit harder for sure, you're right on the money when you say it doesnt hit harder than MS, even some overpowers can rip
[0:21:40] nikthevoker: ive stopped being a movie person and only really liked tv shows
[0:22:06] NightMunchies: i watched em all from 1984  and 2024 i  still liked the 1984 1 way better
[0:22:07] heymomimonttv: i wanna see that new adam sandler movie "the spaceman"
[0:22:09] Badasti: yo
[0:22:12] StromicusRex: i dont care much for shows or movies, i'm a weirdo
[0:22:16] Crucaider: I love Denis Villeneuve cinematic style. His scenes are works of art
[0:22:17] MaximumnNeo: im a huge movie guy too. I love them, and lots of movies that others hate i love
[0:22:31] Badasti: all good man, we got some sunshine here = instant good mood. How are you doing?
[0:22:32] StromicusRex: i dont like sitting there watching something, i wanna be doing stuff ya know
[0:22:35] nikthevoker: @StromicusRex twittch is the only pllace for cool people cmon
[0:22:44] axellent_x: Nice poddy c interview sir, touched on a lot of topics I'm concerned about. Especially mythic tuning and weakauras.
[0:22:48] j0j0j0j0j0j0: TV has seen a huge surge in production quality in the last 10 years. it's also hard to pack as much character development into a movie as opposed to a TV show that has 10 hours of run time

[0:23:40] nikthevoker: howd it go
[0:23:46] suspicious94: I live in Manitoba and yeah this blizzard was bad. snow drifts up to people’s car windows. can’t even get in the vehicle. if people didn’t shovel yesterday the drifts are now rock hard since it’s -34 today

[0:26:29] wowsuomi: Ithought it was boring
[0:26:31] nikthevoker: drama time LUL
[0:26:42] StromicusRex: god we watched talk to me twice in a week
[0:26:46] zerx_gg: i like how jelly always says everything he's doing or looking out for
[0:26:53] Jenjiy0: spill
[0:26:55] Badasti: man I want a new series like Supaernatural to watch, that was the shit
[0:26:56] heymomimonttv: i think jelly viewership is literally just cause of drama even though all parties have been trying to avoid it
[0:27:10] dirtydeus: great poddy c episode gonna try pvp again

[0:27:34] Bwrecker: Ven are you surprised there are no changes?
[0:27:47] heymomimonttv: watching jelly and pika both yesterday and 1 out of every 3 chats was asking what happened and talking shit about the other party. and they both kept trying to shut it down
[0:27:49] xSoulstacex: You do a podcast ven? What was the last ep about?

[0:28:23] shugguls: they could have just added some mmr if no changes
[0:28:29] dirtydeus: uhh how do I start though only pve gear
[0:28:29] heymomimonttv: don't we have to wait for MDI to end as well?
[0:28:39] zachgamegodx: the longer the wait the bigger the list of changes people are expecting
[0:28:42] laalaaland22: AYOOO
[0:28:43] Luigicamp: DinoDance
[0:28:46] Badasti: @wowsuomi yeah for sure, I just want another cool series like that to watch, especially if it has ghosts n stuff
[0:28:50] Jarettol: a few big nerfs to dh would be nice
[0:29:19] zerx_gg: my warrior is still in your guild on EU xdx
[0:29:37] tangell0s: They just don't need to have their entire single target rotation be cleave damage

[1:12:38] amateur_proctologist_: yeah but gorillas have thumbs
[1:12:40] Koraszdormu: "The Grizzly bear's neck is thicker than a Gorilla, so they can't just snap or choke the Bear. A Gorilla could easily snap and choke a weaker opponent's neck with its strong paws, but a bear is a much bigger fish. On the counter, a Grizzly Bear has two weapons to finish off the Gorilla – the claws and the bites."

[1:16:50] cassmann: @What_ln_Tarnation saying you can't outrun a camel fam?
[1:16:56] Luigicamp: just because you see bear-looking people fighting outside iHop it doesn't mean you can take on an actual bear.

[1:30:43] Wild_Shiny: glad you went on Max's podcast, they never talk about pvp and i feel like they have Blizzar'ds ear more than anthing
[1:30:45] Xawo87: Ven I had a really good idea on how to fix Arenas, or at least shuffle mmr - If a class is overrepresented then it should not gain as much rating as a class that is barely played, this would make classes a bit balanced again and people would try to play other things or their main classes. Its sort of the same idea as when people went healers just to be able to play shuffles. What you think?
[1:30:46] KingKingg: Omg
[1:30:50] Bwrecker: ez
[1:30:52] Jenjiy0: omg

[1:31:52] zerx_gg: PepeSpit
[1:31:53] Xawo87: @xanahar or at the very least, classes that are underrepreseted should earn more, just like healers receiving extra stuff from shuffle boxes

[1:51:32] Dopaminex: i think it needs a damage rework
[1:51:41] chancywilson: boomy doesnt have many buttons imo
[1:51:43] Dopaminex: its rotation is really one dimensional
[1:51:45] driftwood_tc: I hate getting trained every game all day as boomie... its exhausting after 5 games.
[1:51:51] atrain742: I loved solo pvp WQs before people started grouping up with 100 buffs
[1:51:56] SloppyWalrus_: boomy feels easy to play
[1:51:57] Dopaminex: dots and starsurge

[1:52:07] ItsBees: Sadge
[1:52:12] Bronloch: DRUID doesnt have many buttons LUL with 4 specs none of them are very complex
[1:52:19] Dopaminex: mushrooms, and 4set wraths, and fury of elune i guess but it all feels negligible
[1:52:25] maralok31: boomy next xpac scares me. don't like the directions
[1:52:26] Dopaminex: just feels like dots and starsurge at the core
[1:52:34] gr_faux: I’ve been having a absolute blast on feral
[1:52:38] Badasti: yeah boomy is kinda like a slightly more mobile shadow priest in my mind, you're just getting clapped 24/7.
[1:52:46] Bronloch: i mean all together all 4 have a lot of buttons but each spec is super simple which is why its the most popular class in the game
[1:52:49] chancywilson: @Bronloch try again that didnt maake sense

[1:53:08] heymomimonttv: since when is druid the most popular class in the game lmfao
[1:53:12] chancywilson: Rdruid has most buttons of heals and is highest skill capped @Bronloch
[1:53:22] Dopaminex: the pig sticker + primordial victory combo looks so cool tho on the unc
[1:53:25] FawxMcRave: should cyclone have a CD
[1:53:26] ferahgok: @Badasti This is true. Boomy is my favorite spec but don't play it if you don't want to get rolled all game everygame
[1:53:27] LilSmashi: its so annoying
[1:53:30] Bronloch: Druid, Pally, Hunter top 3 classes popularity
[1:53:30] Badasti: its really stupid, it shoudl be dispellable, or have a cd and decursed like hex
[1:53:31] LilSmashi: should have hex cd
[1:53:33] NightMunchies: its not mostly u see is Demonhunters lol
[1:53:36] shakeypeachy: how would you nerf cyclone if you were on the balance team? curious for different thoughts from high rated glads
[1:53:44] Bronloch: been that way for years
[1:53:45] famous1939: what if it had a 6 second cd
[1:53:46] Dopaminex: and tbh at the high end i feel like playing against a boomy is so free unless they're paired with a REALLY good rog
[1:53:50] ezprit07: @venruki do you recommend sp or ele for pvp?
[1:53:58] heymomimonttv: @Bronloch in what content?
[1:53:58] storm_chaser_ron: uncleelliott pog
[1:54:06] Dopaminex: like playing dh ele into boomy is so easy if you pair kicks, stuns, and ground
[1:54:07] FlyFYI: if you kick clone it should go on cd
[1:54:10] atrain742: Do you ever change your zoom distance?

[1:54:30] canecreek8: Honestly giving cyclone a 10-15 second cooldown would help
[1:54:43] ATHLTE: lmao
[1:54:45] vodkacran: Or a talent to make it dispellable or have a cd
[1:54:48] Xeliumimar: The hunted as become the Hunter

[1:54:56] Dopaminex: starsurged that guy so frickin hard BIG DAM
[1:55:03] ItsBees: Pog
[1:55:05] ferahgok: @canecreek8 Lol that would absolutely break feral and boomy.

[1:57:16] Ohmx1337: that is a perfect comparison
[1:57:19] Jun_bug__: 1 disc priest took on 10-15 people and won with all the buffs and pets you can get so yeah

[2:45:00] Saitistreamy: @figurines I was just wanting the live reaciton from Venruki on a DH botting at 2.4
[2:45:16] Saitistreamy: in one of the most insanely obvious examples
[2:45:52] figurines: @Saitistreamy yeah I tuned into it. Probably will be a supa videoo to react to later. I was just being a troll sorrry <3
[2:46:51] tonshi1: @figurines 100% Supa will put that on YouTube. That last round was pretty wild, lol
[2:47:24] Saitistreamy: people will still say bots arent a issue or that its mostly ele
[2:49:00] Dawudz: HOW Bot work with ele? @Saitistreamy
[2:49:30] figurines: If there are this many cheats that are obvious it makes you wonder how many are cheating behind the scenes
[2:49:31] freelofear: I just had a DH bot on Mugambala stuck in the starting room lol
[2:50:18] heymomimonttv: are we all gonna have to start fighting/hiding in starting room if there's a DH in lobby now?
[2:51:12] NixxJWM: grease
[2:51:24] Dawudz: who play ench here in ss?
[2:51:27] cyborg1141: We need a observe report system like csgo I dunno
[2:51:27] kerrekerra: Good job on the awc! was really fun to watch this time! just to bad i didnt get to see any hunter ;) !
[2:51:31] heymomimonttv: @Dawudz i do
[2:51:48] rembrandt89: no changes today ?

[2:52:00] heymomimonttv: @Dawudz i like it but its not the best

[2:52:57] Hark0n: a bit of passive def tbh, maybe let ferocity pets also use master's call so they have extra 10% leech
[2:52:59] SteLawBro: Hunters are def weird. Tricky class to pull off but when you see someone good at it they can be a problem. Still seems like they are missing something though.
[2:53:10] CKBandit: if hunters get more defensive, theyll have to nerf their damage, feels insane
[2:53:33] azrothlol: is 1500 subs a good payday?
[2:53:38] kerrekerra: As a hunter main i dont think leech is the move, its the oneshots thats the problem i think
[2:53:43] Cocoapuffs1: they need some type of damage reduction
[2:53:43] bumble_tv: whats that transmog effect called?
[2:53:54] heymomimonttv: @azrothlol its like $3k in a day, so yes
[2:53:57] SteLawBro: The thing is...Screw hunters 😂 Because when hunters are good nobody is having any fun.

[2:55:09] zachgamegodx: they had a twitter beef i think
[2:55:13] Magottx: I was dying yesterday when you were like “yea you and bicmex played for years and became bros” and he’s like “na I trained him he’s not my bro he’s my dog” lmao

[3:02:10] Moobot: Latest video "Breaking Down The Best AWC Game In History (Echo VS Liquid)" view it here: youtu.be/D-DVZfRBzAs
[3:02:22] Grimey_George: I really enjoyed that podcast you had with max and drat. As a player that plays both PVP/PVE, no one ever really talks about the cross overs of the two games modes. We need more of those types of convos imo
[3:02:30] obviouslytai: @StijnDaMan preference
[3:02:52] azrothlol: boomy is only good with Trill on your team
[3:04:01] Dawudz: WHY PPL Jump when they are focus??

[3:40:40] vinnie_on_ttv: Hey dude, Since checking out cata changes and gameplay I was curious if you could tell me about you experience in cata if you remember it.
[3:40:40] NewDee: rudar plays around 13-15% mastery
[3:41:30] vinnie_on_ttv: what about arenas specifically
[3:41:57] Sattiix: why isent rbg popular ?
[3:41:57] jiffyjake: cunning of the cruelll
[3:41:58] jepazo: Whats your opinion on raiding then?

[3:42:04] Six_awc: it was really cool watching the poddyc yesterday! glad they talked about pvp a little bit
[3:42:04] Garthd: Cata raids were good at the time, not sure they hold up today. Was quite a lot harder than wotlk if I recall
[3:42:12] Magottx: i kinda liked cata raids tho back then
[3:42:26] Cvarks: is it gonna be on anyones youtube?

[3:42:40] Cvarks: oh ok
[3:43:02] darkwingdad__: sub rogues one shot in a cheap shot in cata have fun trinketing a cheap shot
[3:43:10] pvalue01: was that your first time speaking with max or dratnos?
[3:43:19] NewDee: seems like dipi is really high at solo na and he goes for 9% mastery so guess it can be both ways
[3:43:23] nikthevoker: YES

[3:47:20] Jenjiy0: nah he's good lmao
[3:47:23] checkemcharles: wtf happened to dratnos tooth
[3:47:26] shivwren: Blizzard doesn't actually read the reports
[3:47:26] tarth_100: lol. no shot its joe’s first time to report for gameplay sabotage
[3:47:39] goesidd: @checkemcharles he bit into bread and it broke
[3:47:42] Badasti: did he scratch his nuts mid rant?
[3:47:45] Europicq: @pvalue01 You really think there are gms who look at "False reports" lol
[3:48:03] Europicq: @pvalue01 They just laid off like 90% of gm teams, it's all automated :)
[3:48:04] ilavayoutv: @pvalue01 kinda hard to ban when a player can rando decide to throw. this goes both ways
[3:48:24] shivwren: NOT SOLO SHUFFLE CONTENT, REPORTED
[3:48:37] pvalue01: @ilavayoutv the SP did not throw. he didnt play the way Joe liked. there's a difference
[3:49:04] pvalue01: @Europicq yep, and thats exactly why false reporting is so fucked. you can get people banned. Should be a severe punishment for false reporting..especially on stream
[3:49:23] Zenfuzz: what video is this
[3:49:38] chaps_86: Good afternoon Ven, really enjoyed your interview will dratnos/max!

[3:51:54] ALLtheEXP: lel
[3:52:07] pvalue01: W for we wireless gamers
[3:52:08] ilavayoutv: @pvalue01 at high rating like joe and other r1s. the plays that that sp was making can be seen as throws. he breaks every cc, even his own
[3:52:32] tangell0s: omni CC is annoying yea
[3:52:33] Axtin: bro fr
[3:52:38] Axtin: how do ppl use that
[3:52:40] Jenjiy0: tell me when?
[3:52:40] pvalue01: @ilavayoutv no it cant quit trolling. making mistakes is not the same as throwing. Throwing is sitting in the gate room and afking

[3:52:43] absterge: well it hates you too

[3:54:04] ilavayoutv: @pvalue01 ? you good? im just having a discussion, but like i said at higher ratings, those go from mistakes to throws real fast. sitting in the starting room is just more obvious
[3:54:09] tangell0s: when pika whips out the selfie cam you know you're having a bad time
[3:54:15] absterge: only rogue can literally stun lock global you then CC you off the stuns to take a selfie for their stream

[3:55:05] chaps_86: the 1v1 on your rsham? or is there a more recent one?
[3:55:12] pvalue01: @ilavayoutv you cannot create a ban policy that bans people for subjective "throws". it is a false report and Joe should be warned or banned

[3:57:18] ItsBees: It's awesome :D
[3:57:23] willie_stroker_99: You should since new patch
[3:57:40] yoko1ono: I mean this bearform is sick
[3:57:49] ilavayoutv: @pvalue01 i see both sides, but tbh the real issue is that blizzard doesnt care enough to do the job themselves and rely on players to do it for them. But as a brief example i had a mage that only blocked when not on my team. i view this as a throw because he had free globals and wasnt locked out
[3:57:55] SAND3LZ: i cant remember but i think it was mage tower tank for the really cool bear form
[3:58:09] piffzorz: lookin good unc

[4:01:06] yoko1ono: Absterge is so hot
[4:01:13] Falcanus: yes but 10.2.6 is coming in march
[4:01:16] SacsTvT: they said so
[4:01:25] Falcanus: 10.2.6 is end of s3
[4:01:27] IuckyIee: who said so
[4:01:33] SAND3LZ: new season is meant to be coming out in about a month
[4:01:40] Falcanus: new season will start a few weeks after 10.2.6 is initially released since its untested
[4:01:51] JonnyJoystick: nerf boomy
[4:01:53] Falcanus: i doubt they will keep s3 going while they test s4 stuff on new patch...
[4:01:55] Swolfz: S4 is 10.2.6, but 10.2.6 launch isn't S4
[4:01:55] yoko1ono: Nerf boomy
[4:01:58] seaent: when ww pre-patch
[4:02:07] seaent: that will be hysterically entertaining
[4:02:15] SacsTvT: i swear i read it in a blue post, but i cant find it now, so i might be lying

[4:02:26] Falcanus: cant member who, but they said 10.2.6 is coming out in march
[4:02:28] Fury73: Said spring release
[4:02:32] IuckyIee: LOL
[4:02:34] Jun_bug__: So what are the thoughts on next expansion
[4:02:36] wabaflaba: 10.2.6 is coming out in march, but idk if itll be the new season
[4:02:40] IuckyIee: this dude posted an article from a month ago
[4:02:47] luriosbael: @venruki this is week 17. the season is 20 weeks with a preseason week. like every other season in this expansion
[4:02:55] thewy: wouldnt it be like a 10.5 if its a new season or something?
[4:02:55] Moobot: Latest video "Breaking Down The Best AWC Game In History (Echo VS Liquid)" view it here: youtu.be/D-DVZfRBzAs
[4:03:06] SAND3LZ: so its been announced for spring
[4:03:11] ItsBees: So much confidence from people who make stuff up Sadge
[4:03:18] SacsTvT: that post says season 4 after launch tho
[4:03:28] satirically1: says ptr will have season 4 testing
[4:03:29] Swolfz: Specifically the 3rd paragraph
[4:03:38] Falcanus: so 10.2.6 is coming in March aka 3 weeks
[4:03:45] Kujo_XX: "We have nothing, so we'll show nothing, Dewey is coming up with something on the fly"
[4:03:46] Vautry: sounds really interesting
[4:03:49] Falcanus: they will test new stuff before starting season 4 on live essentially
[4:03:51] Emerno: another half baked world event like azeroth archive zz
[4:04:04] Falcanus: theres no chance s3 continues with those changes
[4:04:14] JonnyJoystick: probably LFG Rated BGs
[4:04:25] yepbeef: banger
[4:04:26] thewy: I did they were super funky
[4:04:26] Salanzo: tbh a DH nerf is all this season needs to thrive
[4:04:34] TheAgonistxX: top of the post says there will be a PTR for season 4
[4:04:35] mrmsix6: nothing is something worth doing
[4:04:38] ariacy: I just 6-0'd my first shuffle on pres evoker and lost 44 mmr  :D   That encourages me to keep queueing lol

[5:02:53] supatease: wat r u trying to do
[5:02:56] firemonkey170: @venruki what do you think of a mode where you choose PVP only on your char and you insta 70 get insta gear and can go straight into matches? Think it would help arena popularity and easy of access?
[5:03:00] antelopetheuniverse: i wish fire was mage meta
[5:03:00] nightmxz: but destro locks will be getting it instead of mage Kappa
[5:03:07] prometheusx47: ill play dh boomie with u
[5:03:18] ALLtheEXP: @venruki play with Pikabussy
[5:03:56] firemonkey170: for alot of people if they saw arena and wanted to try it they have to either lvl to 70 or buy a boost and still lvl to 70 (from 60) and then spend time gearing up... idk I could see that discouraging people from trying it
[5:03:56] Moobot: Latest video "Breaking Down The Best AWC Game In History (Echo VS Liquid)" view it here: youtu.be/D-DVZfRBzAs
[5:04:29] firemonkey170: lets build yo8ur grocery list together
[5:04:36] morrs: what is the minimum (not too low to be blown away instantly) Item lvl for arenas this season in your opinion
[5:04:41] cixxay: irl reagent bag empty FeelsBadMan
[5:04:46] firemonkey170: do you go when you're hungry or full stomach?
[5:04:50] wackpoetic: They could remove the barrier of entry for PvP by going to PvP Gear Templates instead. I think that, plus copying Ranked Systems from other games (i.e. Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.) and doing a monthly Battle Pass - like a PvP only Adventure Guide - would be great for participation
[5:04:51] Zenfuzz: they should do tier set with picking the stats like before. not these fixed statted pieces we have now
[5:04:56] firemonkey170: if you go when you're hungry i swear it doubles the price
[5:04:57] nc716: YOGURT and string cheese
[5:04:59] gilliytine: @venruki It would be cool if they did an event at this point of the season where u just get 12k conq and can buy a full set of gear. Just to get people into arena.
[5:05:01] Badasti: i was in a shuffle, did someone say pikabussy? wtf lmao
[5:05:04] firemonkey170: MEAT
[5:05:04] Jenjiy0: surely there's some wagyu in the freezer

[5:23:22] SnuxyGG: I think you had ice block
[5:23:40] illEvan11_11: boomies are good when on coordinated teams, in shuffle you basically just get trained all game and nobody does anything reliable to peel or keep you alive
[5:23:47] thatfriggindude: nerf rogue, buff ret!
[5:24:11] zerx_gg: hes pressing the butts
[5:24:13] Roxxybolts: that’s not true @firemonkey170 I’d like to see you try to push on DH
