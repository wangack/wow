[0:00:06] StreamElements: Hydramist is now live! Streaming World of Warcraft: SoD PHASE 2 RUNES & INFO RELEASED | !talents !runes
[0:00:49] Caendras_: Hello there!
[0:01:15] toonits: quick queue into premade eh
[0:01:50] miniwhits: blizz heard your request for mind spike
[0:02:04] Caendras_: I deleted all my alliance characters on living flame cause I wanted to play horde and now Im not able to create a character because the server is locked FeelsBadMan
[0:02:46] miniwhits: yeah hopefully theres more runes for each slot besides what they showed
[0:02:46] toonits: @Caendras_ thats what my friend did a couple days in, he was not happy KEKW
[0:02:57] timortis: priest runes look amazing, warlock runes are hot garbage
[0:03:02] Caendras_: me neither KEKW
[0:03:22] Xerk1: monkaS
[0:04:37] Caendras_: did they leak the new runes?
[0:05:12] Caendras_: check
[0:05:23] Caendras_: how are you today Mr. Streamer?
[0:05:37] Quentey: Best thing is u can PS in Shadowform PogBones
[0:05:55] marduxd: PS and Disperse on same slot would be a good thing
[0:06:08] xdingerx92: How do you think shadow priest will do in pve and pvp in phase 2?
[0:06:35] Sinostra: Hey Hydra, basically blizzard implemented two of your ideas
[0:07:21] Sinostra: are you hyped for phase 2 now ?
[0:07:33] daveydavey27: I'd like to see more new stuff. rather than previous ideas  from other expansions. Although I don't mind a bit of that, for familiarity and things that just work well for classes.
[0:07:51] Sinostra: bg queues and battle royale
[0:08:17] ephixa_fan: hi
[0:08:26] Sinostra: nah, it's FFA
[0:08:33] Sinostra: you'll face horde aswell
[0:09:00] flugrman: the red fog sounds dope af
[0:09:05] zantoria: yo mate, where can i find out more info about the duel tourn coming up?
[0:09:24] zobew: Where is the duel tuorney happening
[0:09:30] bolleboris1: what do you think about the runes?
[0:09:34] Sinostra: the fact you'll be aable to attack your own faction is a big change imo
[0:09:50] daveydavey27: People will also group up unofficially, not in a party/raid but just not attacking each other.
[0:10:16] WeAreFlood: premades will still be a thng with 5 man parties, look at classic era av ranking as an example. 50 ppl jump on disc and form 5 man parties and only take the queue if at least 2 full parties get same queue pop
[0:10:54] Hozitojones: hellow m8
[0:11:16] prodigy_wow: shobekShonoods
[0:11:29] Hozitojones: @Prodigy________________  Heyge
[0:11:32] toonits: pug wsg games are hella enjoyable when the people actually push and try
[0:11:34] daveydavey27: They should introduce rated BGs IMO, but it's not available 24/7. Maybe 2 hours on. 2 hours off.
[0:11:38] WeAreFlood: Im not opposed to premades but if they are going to implement a "fix" then implement a fix, otherwise leave it alone lol
[0:11:40] toonits: but most of the time, nope KEKW
[0:11:53] luzid7: painsub and shadowform is big
[0:11:59] varatupaj: i am so "exited" to play vs priests with that 40% dmg reduction thing Kappa
[0:11:59] prodigy_wow: @Hozitojones  shobekTong shobekTong shobekTong
[0:12:25] justingatlin: @Hydramist will it be possible to use pain suppression on yourself or only on "friendly" targets ?
[0:12:30] FloggerFlogger: Maybe join some GDKP for fun/gold?
[0:12:36] vimovo: stv event sounds similar to your idea with the red fog
[0:12:46] RidarenH: !runes
[0:12:46] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[0:12:46] prodigy_wow: GDKP ban starts p2
[0:12:49] ama__deus: DId i miss you geing over the info drop?
[0:12:52] Quentey: They get banned on p2 launch
[0:12:59] daveydavey27: To avoid people spamming rated BGs all day, allow people some down time to farm consumes and keep people in the world. Plus it will be hype and improve queue times "Rated Bgs up in 30 mins guys, let's get a group together"
[0:13:14] Wilya: Oh, cool, we are playing together
[0:14:00] ama__deus: Will get people's back up if they can't play at that time at all
[0:14:02] callumld67: The problem with death=out, stealth is too powerful
[0:14:20] prodigy_wow: @justingatlin You are a friendly target :D
[0:14:28] daveydavey27: The downside of that, is if some people can't play at that time, even if it's 'prime time' for most people
[0:14:46] kreavesy: or fogs and zone debuffs that occasionally mess with stealth
[0:14:48] FloggerFlogger: Benseven full BiS now?
[0:15:24] prodigy_wow: Im expecting every class gets 6/8 new runes. 4 in boot slot and 4 in belt.  just like we have it now for chest,hands,leg
[0:16:02] xProloli: mind spike 🤡
[0:16:07] tywilldoittv: I was curious from a caster POV do you feel like the changes are going to make casters over tuned in PVP/PVE @ 40 bracket now , or do you feel like at least in PVE stand point this is what casters needed to keep up with the melee meta of warrior/rogue stacking
[0:16:18] callumld67: i really would be interested to see what level a player needs to be to reward currency i guess if they reward honour they reward currency, otherwise its pool boosting fun again :P
[0:16:27] lasagnalord13: gathering professions kinda dead? people just gonna double up on getting profession buffs
[0:16:34] luzid7: ye its so retail ^^
[0:16:36] Danimal_Media: who wanted eclipse too?
[0:16:48] DnB_Junkee: @Prodigy________________ prolly more, as there is runes new runes for existing slots revealed
[0:16:48] ama__deus: At least it's not the worst version of eclipse
[0:16:55] justingatlin: mage runes seems kinda uselees for frost mage thats sad :-(
[0:16:59] garmok1979: STV event HYPE
[0:17:12] daveydavey27: Druid needs more runes that are universal for all specs
[0:17:15] prodigy_wow: @DnB_Junkee Where? the new stuff was all belt and boot runes
[0:17:34] prodigy_wow: @DnB_Junkee Oh i see the shaman one
[0:17:35] DnB_Junkee: @Prodigy________________ two hand shaman rune is for chest for instance
[0:17:50] fiskensfriend: with talents + proc starfire is 2.5 sec. Just like a frostbolt
[0:17:53] prodigy_wow: @DnB_Junkee Maybe thats just some extra 2 handed shaman support for the 2 handed boys who were crying
[0:18:01] callumld67: i feared boots will be all mobilty shit
[0:18:04] marduxd: 2hand shaman wont work with maelstrom
[0:18:09] garmok1979: yeah no toxic stuff looks like
[0:18:25] Shabz_: what happens to everyone should be OP
[0:18:26] rosing123: no engi toys until p3 pepehands
[0:18:30] garmok1979: @marduxd not necessarily. Maybe it'll be procs-per-minute, so 2h will proc as much as dual wield
[0:18:31] vimovo: kinda wish they didn’t reveal so much tbh
[0:18:32] moosywow: cant wait to spam r1 bolt to get missiles procs
[0:18:33] Danimal_Media: still hoping for spell reflect and shockwave
[0:18:33] daveydavey27: cloak of shadows would be soooo toxic
[0:18:35] ama__deus: Played it safe with the runes and it's probably the right call
[0:18:38] nizule: truth
[0:18:39] alexbilbaoo: true haha
[0:18:40] tywilldoittv: TRUE
[0:18:41] ama__deus: LUL
[0:18:42] xProloli: lol
[0:18:43] jooperus: yes
[0:18:46] tywilldoittv: When is that coming FFS
[0:18:46] nednerbtx: trap launcher seems like a horrible addition imo
[0:18:52] DnB_Junkee: @Prodigy________________ I expect more runes than 8 per class, because of quite some more areas and dungeons being available
[0:18:53] ama__deus: Just encourages people to not play the objectives in pugs, though
[0:18:55] Danimal_Media: yeah 100% need it, hate seeing like 16 KBs knowing they're jsut kill stealing
[0:19:03] Shabz_: they didn't talk about dual spec tho..
[0:19:04] omawamousinda: hunter who is defending with low damage o7
[0:19:05] nednerbtx: agree with in combat trapping
[0:19:10] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:19:39] Wilya: If you don't have the epic sword from BFD. Do you reckon SMF and one-handers are better for pvp?
[0:19:54] Sinostra: lock runes are kinda underwhelming :(
[0:19:54] alexbilbaoo: Dwarfs hunters POGGERS 2 blinds off
[0:20:09] justingatlin: priest looks one of the strongest with the new runes
[0:20:11] nizule: just like pws
[0:20:12] UnsafeCell: priests are going to be op, right?
[0:20:26] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist best and worst change that has been announced for P2?
[0:20:42] callumld67: i guess disperion will be same slot, its a must
[0:20:47] justingatlin: and shaman aswell they got three runes
[0:20:57] jazni_23: disc 4life
[0:21:04] ama__deus: Make shared CDs persist then
[0:21:19] stahlbizeps: make it not switchable if its on cd
[0:21:31] prodigy_wow: Rune swapping is fun but my bags are sad
[0:21:32] rosing123: only rockethelm will be plate now right, from ulda
[0:21:35] rosing123: or is it mail
[0:21:44] omawamousinda: 4 rogues :D
[0:21:58] Shabz_: they didn't talk about gnomes engeneer being OP
[0:21:58] ama__deus: Not a fan of rune swapping OOC in the same engagement and stuff like that, but we do have it for items equipped, so who knows. It IS fun with trinkets
[0:22:18] justingatlin: omg eye cancer incoming with the new "red shining STV"
[0:22:22] nokkxmokk: hey man, from a scale to 1-10 how happy were you to find out we are getting ps?
[0:22:27] fiskensfriend: @ama__deus rune swapping is the best thing about sod imo
[0:22:27] rosing123: @Shabz_ they delaying engi specs till p3
[0:22:27] garmok1979: honestly, event swapping weapons for 2x rockbiter to snapshot Sham Rage is not fun
[0:22:28] shingoshango: what professions are you going for in p2?
[0:22:56] ama__deus: @fiskensfriend I mean in the sense of, using a powerful one, then waiting for combat to drop and then using another powerful one while the other is on CD
[0:23:04] ama__deus: Seems too arcadey to me
[0:23:15] fiskensfriend: @ama__deus ye i actually think that is pretty cool.
[0:23:20] Baxxtah: rofl
[0:23:22] ama__deus: @fiskensfriend Fair!
[0:23:49] fiskensfriend: @ama__deus as is ur take! Maybe ill do a 180 come lvl 60 with 36 abilites
[0:23:57] Shabz_: you not switching to retail like other streamers ?
[0:24:03] UnsafeCell: imagine ps and md in the same slot
[0:24:12] omawamousinda: are you gonna farm till 21k?
[0:24:14] Shabz_: waiting room
[0:24:16] varatupaj: i chronobooned dmf buff
[0:24:21] ama__deus: Nobody waits in retail KEKW
[0:24:23] peeweeherman69: sod is dead af
[0:24:33] mesiausx: super pumped for P2! I am tossed between my feral or my rogue....
[0:24:35] robocoptitletheme: classic jackass
[0:24:36] ama__deus: Yeah, definitely was Jackass LUL
[0:24:38] Xerk1: LUL
[0:24:43] pew2700: Dude priest is going to be so freaking insane!
[0:24:52] pew2700: That mind spike looks crazy
[0:24:59] Dreameaterz: yoooo ryan i can see some changes in the room mate looks sick
[0:24:59] nizule: Feral going to be nasty imo
[0:25:07] nokkxmokk: so shadowform+ps will be a thing?
[0:25:07] DistrictDingo: I could have lived my whole life without that omelette info, fuck
[0:25:09] omawamousinda: "yay my penance bounce 20 times" POGGIES Gayge
[0:25:15] mesiausx: @nizule getting king of the jungle seems sick
[0:25:48] Bloch29: Do you think Mind Spike will be a cast or instantcast?
[0:26:24] prodigy_wow: Spike was spammable when it came out
[0:26:31] prodigy_wow: its from cata i believe
[0:26:49] vesand: cata removed
[0:26:50] miniwhits: how quick was the mind spike cast usually
[0:27:11] Dreameaterz: we need a mana regen ability bro, shadow gonna be gutted without
[0:27:18] vesand: but it made mind blast instant cast also if i remember
[0:27:18] salken: i wish they added that mind spike instead and also shadow orbs instead of the stacking buffs
[0:27:31] Bloch29: Twisted Faith with Mind Blast talents
[0:27:37] ama__deus: Boots aren't the only new rune slot we get, is it?
[0:27:54] fiskensfriend: rogues get insane ability as a MANUAL legit 3rd rune right there
[0:27:58] Insolencexx: I hope they also come up with more new stuff and not just copy later expansions
[0:27:59] ama__deus: Still plenty of potential for belt then
[0:27:59] flugrman: do you think epic staff will remain bis @hydramist ?
[0:28:39] callumld67: @sportstud007 they said there will be 3x the amount of epics in gnomer than BFD, so imma say no
[0:28:46] prodigy_wow: @sportstud007 it wont
[0:29:01] vitaminabcdefgh: pvp events etc
[0:29:02] Bloch29: From dungeon and epics from STV coins
[0:29:13] ama__deus: Think they mean additional sources outside the raid
[0:29:21] Bloch29: STV Bloodmoon will be so hype
[0:29:32] flugrman: enchanting epic looks good
[0:29:48] prodigy_wow: Im thinking the boots will be bis forever
[0:30:08] ama__deus: Yeah, solid
[0:30:33] isheria: @Hydramist i reckon this new event in STV is almost like you wanted it right?:)
[0:31:36] ama__deus: Glad the pummeler got feral AP on it as well
[0:32:02] ama__deus: Just a vanity trinket, I think
[0:32:04] prodigy_wow: Just for fun items
[0:32:16] Synckery: sup Ry, excited for phase 2? looks like solid decisions so far from blizz
[0:32:17] prodigy_wow: I love the set token
[0:32:23] ama__deus: I wonder if there will be multiple sets per armor class or only 1 again
[0:32:45] ama__deus: Hope we get fortitude mana reduction KEKW
[0:32:54] umadcozudead: !runes
[0:32:54] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[0:33:02] Tromto: +1% range attack hit / crit on plate armor xD
[0:33:02] prodigy_wow: Maybe we will get AOE Fort / Shadow prot
[0:33:12] flugrman: what does enhanced blessings do
[0:33:13] xdingerx92: surely feral needs to get that too then
[0:33:16] Restartlife: BigW for shadow priest
[0:33:17] jookmeat: moving totems
[0:33:17] miniwhits: all totems in one spot
[0:33:19] Synckery: moving totems
[0:33:20] brexy808: can throw your totems
[0:33:26] joebu123: all totems
[0:33:29] prodigy_wow: Relocates your active totems to the specified location.
[0:33:30] brexy808: or 4 down at a time
[0:33:32] jookmeat: saves mana, don't have to recast totems when you move around
[0:33:35] motod0x: nah, crafting is on helm this time
[0:33:36] Restartlife: They can place their totems down where they want
[0:33:38] motod0x: you go 3 set
[0:33:55] jookmeat: could be sicko mode with earthgrab totem
[0:34:08] jookmeat: totem project the slow to chase
[0:34:31] Bloch29: It is one from each item yes
[0:34:32] ama__deus: @jookmeat also sick to keep people in combat with a ranged searing totem etc LUL
[0:34:47] jookmeat: agreed
[0:35:00] motod0x: it is 1 on each, it says first sentence which slot its for
[0:35:08] Baxxtah: Totemic Projection is to move your current totems you have down?
[0:35:21] justingatlin: can u use both rune slots ? or only one of them ?
[0:35:32] callumld67: you still wont cast starfire thou surely cos of kicks locking you out of surge
[0:35:39] toonits: ferals can start booping clothies in wpvp POGGERS
[0:35:42] Synckery: melee wings pala is how it feels like theyre trying to push pala
[0:35:53] Quentey: Preg paladin incoming Kappa
[0:35:56] Bloch29: Same with shaman rune
[0:36:05] shingoshango: could be op for PVP?
[0:36:07] nx310: pallys had to do that in wrath a bit so
[0:36:25] sm3ed: it’s divine plea
[0:36:31] stuttersx: basically a plea, 25% total
[0:36:38] justingatlin: because paladin boots glyph not good in many situation so u dont use it ?
[0:36:39] marduxd: Personaly i hope for holy shield or the instant flash of light procc thingy
[0:36:46] callumld67: its surely like plea, you pop it then have to melee
[0:36:50] prodigy_wow: Shockadin support? :o
[0:36:50] justingatlin: just let the slot empty
[0:37:38] racerkill: yes it's broken
[0:37:41] callumld67: +flanking strike reset
[0:37:43] Synckery: ye theyre gonna do omega dmg
[0:37:43] Bloch29: Yeah crazy dmg with Flanking Strike also
[0:37:44] ControversyTV: hunters sound more dangerous in mele now then ranged its confusing
[0:38:02] DucktorLarsen: It looks hella broken, you'll speak 2/2 savage strikes in Survival and rest in BM.
[0:38:09] stuttersx: surv gonna own
[0:38:15] Synckery: someone call Kasu its time to come to SoD Kappa
[0:38:16] varatupaj: now hunters will run around toss traps at people
[0:38:42] ama__deus: Imagine launching a freezing trap onto a FC LUL
[0:38:44] callumld67: DOuble Entrapment with Frost and explosive trap!!
[0:39:16] Bloch29: Need to update you pvp tier list BuddhaBar
[0:39:30] Studiovirtanen: @Bloch29 WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[0:39:51] ama__deus: Blood Surge also looks like a massive PVE buff again LUL
[0:40:03] varatupaj: you toss frost trap on someone and send pet with bestial wrath - gg
[0:40:06] Caledvwych: How long in SoD is 1-25?
[0:40:11] racerkill: it will work with quick strike too
[0:40:22] ama__deus: @Caledvwych like 2 days of playing at most
[0:40:41] peeweeherman69: trash
[0:40:44] prodigy_wow: Rogue preview is super boring
[0:40:51] prodigy_wow: Master of sub is so lame
[0:40:51] callumld67: @Caledvwych and 50% exp buff 1-25 coming with P2 launch
[0:40:55] jookmeat: it's over for us rogue bros....
[0:41:20] ama__deus: Doesn't help that MB itself is kinda low damage LUL
[0:41:47] lordlaesooor: i think its a little bit too bc/wrath focused rune wise. like priest is just wrath rn with pain supp/mending/penance? so wrath priest in the vanilla setting. i was hoping for a bit more creativity, hunter and rog is step in right directions i think.
[0:41:52] prodigy_wow: I wouldnt think so
[0:41:55] prodigy_wow: itll be like TBC PS
[0:41:58] justingatlin: rogues runes not healthy for the game @Hydramist
[0:41:59] callumld67: No chance while stunned
[0:42:01] optik_rec0rds: doubt
[0:42:04] Dreameaterz: The dispell resist on pain seems good too
[0:42:10] Bloch29: But remember we get lvl 40 Mind Blast, so might actually be good
[0:42:16] ama__deus: @lordlaesooor isn't every hunter complaining that they're basically the same as classic? LUL
[0:42:28] optik_rec0rds: the warlock runes are total garbage and have to be a joke
[0:42:33] Sinostra: lock runes are pve focused, they don't add much
[0:42:36] lordlaesooor: @ama__deus for melee hunter i meant
[0:42:45] varatupaj: @optik_rec0rds +
[0:43:08] ama__deus: Dance seems a tank lock rune
[0:43:12] prodigy_wow: Tanks dont want to lifetap i guess
[0:43:13] optik_rec0rds: its 1 dot tick extra for an entire rune slot like wtf
[0:43:14] callumld67: tanks i guess
[0:43:16] Studiovirtanen: YE!!
[0:43:18] stuttersx: so tanks dont have to waste a global on tap
[0:43:19] justingatlin: mindspike mindblast shadow word death is good burst @Hydramist
[0:43:19] Studiovirtanen: GIVE US SOME FUKING MANA
[0:43:20] Sinostra: i'm hoping for better once P2 comes out
[0:43:43] varatupaj: even dot refreshing thing is bad, you dont want to refresh agony because you will lose dmg
[0:44:01] prodigy_wow: I dont get this one at all. need to see it in game
[0:44:07] Synckery: basically like a held atonement
[0:44:08] ama__deus: You just deal damage and get a buff that you can heal with within 15s
[0:44:09] Haurlin: suspiciously missing druid runes 🤔
[0:44:11] ama__deus: from my understanding
[0:44:16] Zhadix: Its like the evoker ability
[0:44:19] ofcorpse_: interactions with fire/frost/arcane talents tho
[0:44:22] Studiovirtanen: @Haurlin NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:44:28] Synckery: @Haurlin theyre at the top :)
[0:44:28] ama__deus: @Haurlin they are there. Eclipse + King of the Jungle
[0:44:29] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[0:44:31] prodigy_wow: Does that mean if you counterspell this they are locked out of everything?
[0:44:33] callumld67: i guess its based on the damage you output during the time you build it up?
[0:44:54] UnsafeCell: work with arcane blast
[0:45:05] smalltpyo: Super interesting thing is the new rune slots as well - these are for boots and belt whichj currently have no runes :)
[0:45:07] ama__deus: Think it' s passive with a CD
[0:45:10] alexander_yudin: Magee only get 2 new runes !?
[0:45:13] smalltpyo: Excited to see those lvl 60 neck runes haha
[0:45:17] Joelol360: hey ryan whats up read the patch it looks pretty good what do u think about it
[0:45:50] marduxd: Its crazy that lava burst is on maelstrom
[0:45:56] prodigy_wow: great vs rogue
[0:46:30] Landon_MDL: ofc
[0:46:31] Landon_MDL: ppc
[0:46:34] callumld67: 2.00 Crowd Pummeler + 30% haste + Flurry + One Use + gloves + WF....
[0:46:49] googlewooglex: missed your comments about priest runes
[0:47:04] optik_rec0rds: do i understand it right that enchanters get a constant 20 spell power buff
[0:47:59] Busa170: youre enemy with your own faction too I heard?
[0:48:06] callumld67: i dont think thats possible to do, and hurts healers if you need to tag
[0:48:12] alexbilbaoo: @Busa170 yeah.ffa
[0:48:15] Tearyn_: thats how i read it. "Free for all"
[0:48:46] Busa170: if its ffa it will be hard to coordinate a big group of multiple parties
[0:48:50] jvandervennet: Penalized for grouping right?  Has to be solo?
[0:49:01] cunderthuntz_: they will all be hostile to each other though?
[0:49:09] meuusi: Penalized for raiding not grouping
[0:49:20] alexander_yudin: layering too
[0:49:23] darkstarklife: thats the big one
[0:49:28] cunderthuntz_: will get confusing with your team in red
[0:49:30] cunderthuntz_: also aoe
[0:49:30] darkstarklife: out of groups but still grouping
[0:49:37] robocoptitletheme: seems like a hassle, but people will min max like always ofc
[0:49:42] UnsafeCell: loa will punish them
[0:49:48] callumld67: weak aura / assist X
[0:49:51] stereomonkey_: how to prevent ppl wintrading kills?
[0:49:58] ironpallyone: this will get changed fast, people will just exploit and kill each other and not do the evenet
[0:50:13] Extramediums: taming
[0:50:13] alexbilbaoo: Honestly,the only thing that concerns me is the LAG
[0:50:16] Extramediums: teaming*
[0:50:30] Busa170: @ironpallyone yeh I can see people trading/feeding for marks etc
[0:50:30] prodigy_wow: Colluding
[0:50:43] motod0x: they should make the travelling mob walk to the place in stv that is the highest density of players - that will also encourage them to split up
[0:50:44] callumld67: i guess blizz have that tech for mobs.. i wonder if they can make that work on players 'to grey the player'
[0:50:50] darkstarklife: grouping up will bring dmg reduction probably or some crazy debuf that attracts elites maybe
[0:50:50] peeweeherman69: ofc gonna be some fuckfest exploits its wow they always find a way to cringe it up
[0:50:57] alexander_yudin: it invites lots of griefing
[0:51:10] meuusi: I think marks will not loot multiple time from the same player
[0:51:43] motod0x: its like a fel reaver
[0:51:44] darkstarklife: TBH i couldnt ask for anything more the whole system sounds really inviting but will defiantly be buggy
[0:51:47] lilty92: Like a fel reaver
[0:51:47] motod0x: that pats STV
[0:51:50] Restartlife: Big Elite mob/boss
[0:51:51] ugyesgyerek: like a gigachad Fel Reaver?
[0:51:53] prodigy_wow: My guess is a mob
[0:51:59] callumld67: surely gunna be a NPC that like camps the gy and stuff
[0:52:01] alexander_yudin: would be cool if it were a player but probably a mob
[0:52:05] ironpallyone: that is the 40 man raid buster, I will spawn on raids
[0:52:10] darkstarklife: OH GUYS HALO NEW SEASON ON FEB 8 SO EXCITED
[0:52:11] alexbilbaoo: It appears in the video
[0:52:18] Kreynz: looking forward to +50% dmg on-use helm + arcane power + arcane surge?
[0:52:21] Restartlife: That tiger looks sweet
[0:52:50] darkstarklife: or get both
[0:52:55] prodigy_wow: Underworld is hot
[0:52:57] optik_rec0rds: did you check out the new profs yet ? do i understand it right that enchanters get  a passiv 20 sp buff ?
[0:53:07] darkstarklife: Have you talked about your opinioin on MIND SPIKE
[0:53:32] callumld67: talking of 20 groups of 5 people grouping on discord :P
[0:53:38] Restartlife: There will be 5man premade than
[0:54:21] faygodreaming_: solo q will still hurt 😞
[0:54:27] ecthor2205: they did this in wsg in season of mastery, the quetime was 30min+
[0:54:52] prodigy_wow: Cross faction bgs would help with this too
[0:55:35] callumld67: also likely the premade meta will go AB tho right?
[0:56:09] Restartlife: Will not apply to playters after 39! Pog
[0:56:16] ecthor2205: @callumld67 ranking in season of mastery they still went wsg for faster games and more honor, unless u had only 7min games in AB, which rarely happend
[0:56:25] Omgezzz: really like it....tired of all premade , even if some are easy pray tho
[0:56:29] lordlaesooor: what pvp rank will be max next phase?
[0:56:39] ecthor2205: 5
[0:57:47] peeweeherman69: cloth helm is op af LUL
[0:58:01] Kreynz: i guess you still need to use level 25 boots if theres no upgrade to it
[0:58:07] Kreynz: 30% dr too good
[0:58:08] Restartlife: by the tooltip from that LW head, I see that Nature protection pot in the raid will be bis
[0:58:53] Synckery: fuck rogues kek
[0:59:12] marduxd: ye
[0:59:17] ugyesgyerek: earth shock too
[0:59:18] alexbilbaoo: Dwarfs hunters fukcing with 2 blinds
[0:59:20] Restartlife: Alot of shaman spells
[0:59:20] Goated_Goods: Stormstrike
[0:59:20] Synckery: and wrath ye
[0:59:23] prodigy_wow: i bet this is also very good vs some gnomer mechanic
[0:59:43] zickiwow: means eleshaman op in p2
[0:59:58] prodigy_wow: This helm will also be bis forever
[1:00:01] Kreynz: imagine stacking that on-use with arcane power on mage with surge
[1:00:07] Javylyne: enh sham will be fun too
[1:00:07] Goated_Goods: Damn!
[1:00:11] prodigy_wow: Cheap dplague with that
[1:00:26] callumld67: DP back on the menu
[1:00:33] prodigy_wow: Its divine illumination on a helm
[1:00:38] Seriumosa: No specializations means no Goblin Sapper Charge in P2 then I guess
[1:01:01] shingoshango: devouring plague baby with that helm for sure!
[1:01:25] Restartlife: Void is so insane
[1:01:30] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Will you have to redo your tierlist?
[1:01:48] lordlaesooor: better than arcane shards from elf lul
[1:02:01] Peoplewhinetoomuch: I think Enha shaman might jump up
[1:02:05] yicetv: best race on alliance? :x
[1:02:12] alexbilbaoo: Dwarf hunters s+ haha
[1:02:19] prodigy_wow: Can it actually kill you? says side effect : death
[1:02:28] MxKV__: morning Hydra!  o7
[1:02:54] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Mutation, turns you into a trogg LUL
[1:02:55] varatupaj: you drink this and die :D
[1:02:57] callumld67: 1% of death?
[1:03:17] MxKV__: INSTADEATH
[1:03:18] Goated_Goods: Maybe you don't want to point it in a certain "direction"? :)
[1:03:32] fdwl2008: !runes
[1:03:33] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[1:03:57] peeweeherman69: mfing 3 month p1 for that????
[1:04:00] Kreynz: wonder if pain sup will be usable while stunned
[1:04:08] zickiwow: cloak of shadows and shadowstep inc
[1:04:08] ugyesgyerek: trap launcher + entrapment will be nutty
[1:04:10] nizule: caster shaman still a big ?. Shame
[1:04:39] callumld67: Wpvp is always a clusterfck, so we can never expect too much
[1:04:39] gitzw: you can ps yourself right?
[1:04:43] ugyesgyerek: you can throw both frost trap and explo, both proccing entrapment
[1:04:53] Kreynz: i have no diea how the new mage rune heal works, tooltip seems confusing, is it a proc or what
[1:05:02] tecncaldificltes: Radiant Ray Reflectors .... BiS
[1:05:35] vitaminabcdefgh: +15% extra hp to all members in a 40 raid is kinda clutch though
[1:06:10] UnsafeCell: like mass disspell?
[1:06:10] peeweeherman69: stv gonna be lagfest shitfest or getting ganked by groups kl beans
[1:06:12] MxKV__: It'll be crazy to have pain sup as shadow (potentially)
[1:06:33] Restartlife: Shadow priest gonna be nutty
[1:06:37] callumld67: PS cld come with a 'weakened soul' esk debuff to stop the rune swap
[1:07:09] Kreynz: @MxKV__ imagine spriest with both penance and pain sup, without penance breaking sform
[1:07:12] svettsune: Ey peeps!
[1:07:14] Bloch29: I want a twohand shaman spell also. Can't use Lava Lash
[1:07:17] prodigy_wow: permanent bloodlust for 2 handed shaman nbd
[1:07:23] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @Bloch29 lava burst
[1:07:24] MxKV__: @Kreynz Pog
[1:07:30] Yungbtw: 3pc set bonus are pretty nice
[1:07:36] Bloch29: Survival Hunter S-tier now?
[1:07:38] nintoz: do you break shadow when popping ps?
[1:07:57] nabiyaz: is bloodmoon possibly a battle royale-style storm? sorry just joined
[1:08:08] Goated_Goods: It shouldn't. It has always been a Disc spell and not Holy
[1:08:41] nwjames1310: I bet we get VT for shadow pain supp for disc
[1:08:48] Kreynz: penance is like pws as well
[1:08:53] Dotcomgodx: Starting to look like Robbie Williams now when ur older :D
[1:08:53] Goated_Goods: Yeah last talent in Disc for WOTLK. has to run the same
[1:09:06] Goated_Goods: errr not last but deep
[1:09:16] nwjames1310: True
[1:09:17] alexander_yudin: no more GDKP runs wow !!
[1:09:31] Kreynz: i think mindspike could be good for pve purely because it will benefit from curse of elements (frost dmg)
[1:10:08] nwjames1310: I mean druids got innervate
[1:10:14] nwjames1310: Mages evo
[1:10:22] DeathToad007: sod team saving wow
[1:10:26] peeweeherman69: sod dev team defo main priest
[1:10:34] Kreynz: i'd like mages to get a rune that makes evo a 2 min cd instant cast that also restores 60% of your health
[1:10:46] rollinsthechamp: How they gonna ban it tho? If there´s a community they will continue doing gdkp's on discord
[1:10:51] Baxxtah: bm to queue up with rs
[1:11:04] ironpallyone: how can you even que with rez sickness? like how is that a thing
[1:11:14] robocoptitletheme: impressed by phase 2 so far, looks like another 2-3 months of gaming
[1:12:09] Kreynz: paypal gdkps
[1:12:13] Kreynz: just auction everything for real money in disc
[1:12:15] Kreynz: no gold traded in-game
[1:12:17] Extramediums: people will just say "Oh, can I buy this item off the highest roller?"
[1:13:04] nwjames1310: Stv is gonna be insane with all these abilities
[1:13:32] DeathToad007: isnt wild growth better utility then sunfire is damge?
[1:14:28] megablink1: is that a technics 1200 in the back?
[1:14:55] Gallowxyz: Anyone know how to get Classic Aura Durations working?
[1:15:11] fitthasse: download the addobn
[1:15:16] Kappa_Boyz: what OP spec yall playing in season 2?
[1:15:23] bcalicore: did he comment on mind spike yet?

[1:16:47] fitthasse: What addon is it that "highlights" dispellable magic buffs on enemy uniframes? @Hydramist  <3
[1:17:39] Lunaatj: Nice rotation you got there bro.
[1:17:44] Lunaatj: 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 3
[1:17:46] Lunaatj: KEKW
[1:18:04] varatupaj: its a best rotation
[1:18:08] varatupaj: all dmg is free
[1:18:13] varatupaj: no mana
[1:18:27] Lunaatj: True.
[1:19:23] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[1:21:32] Sinostra: yeah, but you also gotta consider the other specs
[1:21:37] ama__deus: I don't know where I am supposed to get the keybinds from on priest with all those new runes NotLikeThis
[1:21:46] mrchappey: what are you thinking is gonna be top dog after those notes my dude
[1:21:56] justingatlin: warlock priest mage and balance druid are mine LUL
[1:21:57] Sinostra: there's one shit affliction rune, dunno how much other runes affli is gonna get
[1:21:58] Macdaddyswag69: do u think they should add augmentation evoker to sod?
[1:22:06] Steggy_730: should i take my boomie or hunter to 40? please help me choose!
[1:22:25] ausgeo: what’s your boomkin build?
[1:22:44] Sinostra: that's why affli needs UA, to protect DL :)
[1:23:26] beetleplop: what proffs do you think will be bussin for priest and druid P2?
[1:23:32] Cafe0le: eclipse is ResidentSleeper for boomy
[1:23:41] varatupaj: i am planning to go full braindead mode and farm arati to exalted as  well, so at 60 i will get epic bracers, pants, shoulders and and weapon :D
[1:23:46] icestag: i think meeles will destroy them with that dmg they have at 40
[1:24:05] justingatlin: this range trapping for hunter is cringe also the range stun rogue already has. makes no sense... and the paladin range instant damage is stupid af...
[1:24:28] icestag: and with sl they dont realy have instant casts
[1:24:38] faygodreaming_: @hydramist did they show anything new for Druid ?
[1:24:46] justingatlin: what makes it healthy is that they can use it in fight but the range trapping makes no sense in the classic mind i think
[1:25:08] ama__deus: All depends how long the arm time is imo
[1:25:10] svizura: hello h
[1:25:15] varatupaj: the problem with drain that its the same as starsurge for druids, you just die without it because everyone does a lot of dmg with runes
[1:25:34] justingatlin: the most stupid thing is that  rogues have a RANGE stun in classic... thats very sad
[1:26:02] ama__deus: Is it just ClassicAuraDurations for you to see buffs on enemies? Never seems to work for me
[1:26:53] Plushie__Tv: i have the same issue ama_deus
[1:27:08] alexbilbaoo: @ama__deus u need to check an option
[1:27:21] alexbilbaoo: @ama__deus the one that realoads
[1:27:56] Kreynz: a bit sad they didn't add arena, oh well maybe next phase
[1:28:23] alexbilbaoo: rbgs > arenas
[1:28:23] ama__deus: @alexbilbaoo I only got "Hook target frame, "Full aura recplament", "show portrait icon", "verbose portrait icon", "player portrait icon" and "large personal debuffs" as my ClassicAuraDurations options
[1:28:27] justingatlin: gurubashi 2v2
[1:28:42] Kreynz: gurubashi has no los tho it's not really arena
[1:28:51] Kreynz: 1v1 could work in gurubashi i guess
[1:29:31] justingatlin: 2v2 gurubashi disc priest / frost mage <3
[1:29:55] alexbilbaoo: @ama__deus "Hook" - "Full aura"  and "large personal debuffs"
[1:30:06] futurafree_: mate. I lost epic staff vs resto Druid 11 to 12 roll
[1:30:09] futurafree_: true pain
[1:30:11] prodigy_wow: 1v1 arena would be dope i wouldnt mind a pillar that goes up and down like ring of valor
[1:30:29] alexbilbaoo: @ama__deus The one that do the job is Full Aura Replacement
[1:30:31] berni2031: sup :) where are u steaming for ?
[1:30:37] Kreynz: ring of valor would actually be good for 1v1 i think lmao
[1:31:01] jazni_23: how about dueling zones that reset all cd's everytime a duel starts? basically 1v1 arena w/o ranking
[1:31:23] prodigy_wow: @vexile_23 the dream
[1:31:32] Kreynz: imo they should remove the jumping exploits in wsg if they do rbg's
[1:31:37] Kreynz: it's a bit cringe
[1:32:26] xProloli: tunnel jumps are cool
[1:32:29] icestag: why do you think warlocks will be good at 40? the drainlife can be dispellt, blink out of range, block and sl have no instant casts
[1:32:39] Kreynz: they could add some new bg's as well
[1:32:45] Kreynz: silvershard mine would be fun
[1:32:51] Kreynz: it's even in STV lore wise!
[1:32:53] JavaSkrpt: Buzzy bee
[1:33:27] JavaSkrpt: SSM was a favorite
[1:33:28] Kreynz: unless warlocks get UA xd
[1:33:50] futurafree_: thoughts on priest runes?
[1:33:59] JavaSkrpt: I presume more runes will pair w/ Mind Spike and PS.
[1:34:07] Sinostra: depends on what other classes gets
[1:34:16] Kreynz: mage will have a guaranteed unavoidable 1 shot if u can use the crafted helm with arcane power
[1:34:20] Sinostra: you make it sound like locks dominated p1, lol
[1:34:31] Conqueroraabqzxt: whats the point to spam this lvl25 server?
[1:34:50] satras12: are the runes that they showed the only ones we get or there are more in p2?
[1:35:25] futurafree_: ps + shadow form + boots
[1:35:31] Sprovs323: Why do you think mind spike is bad? I feel like it could be super good for shadow, also makes a non rune ability like Mind Blast way stronge
[1:35:46] Kreynz: shadowform is only physical damage reduction i think
[1:35:53] Kreynz: in classic
[1:36:07] ama__deus: Same for me actually (though with premade) LUL
[1:36:24] Sinostra: premades are enjoying it while they can
[1:36:33] JavaSkrpt: 9 v 10 premade, gg
[1:36:42] icestag: i think feral will be sooo good
[1:36:47] JavaSkrpt: It's a done deal
[1:37:10] JavaSkrpt: Other than Mind Spike, what offensive priest spell would be a good option?
[1:37:25] Sinostra: they want the rep
[1:37:34] Sinostra: they don't care about pvp itself
[1:38:00] Kreynz: i did a few premade games the other day and we were still just GY farming other premades
[1:38:03] Kreynz: i think most premades just suck
[1:38:05] ama__deus: There isn't a lot of self respect to go around in Classic tbf KEKW
[1:38:08] wheeezyp: meanwhile the shamelss premade camp the gy lol
[1:38:10] Kreynz: but they will will steamroll pugs
[1:38:34] JavaSkrpt: VT on disc...hmm.
[1:38:37] JavaSkrpt: Could be nutty
[1:38:41] ama__deus: 5% better, but still go from not winning anything to winning 90% LUL
[1:39:00] Kreynz: earlier on i queued up as 5 and we beat some disc using streaming full 10 bis comp premade lmao
[1:39:01] Kreynz: was satisfying
[1:39:31] JavaSkrpt: Sweaty dickin'
[1:40:16] Sinostra: so how'd that smite spec bfd go ?
[1:41:04] prodigy_wow: Noice
[1:41:06] Kreynz: were you using many gcds on healing still?
[1:41:07] Kreynz: or pure dmg
[1:41:13] ama__deus: Still healed, right? Just healer dps?
[1:41:15] ama__deus: Ah
[1:41:34] prodigy_wow: Needed shadow dmg bracers
[1:41:44] prodigy_wow: or you did nevermind
[1:42:14] jram_tv: click on your name
[1:42:22] Kreynz: is that actually avizura playing sod lmao
[1:42:24] Kreynz: or someone memeing
[1:42:33] Kreynz: ahk
[1:42:51] Kreynz: is that cause you oom'd?
[1:42:57] Kreynz: need better kill times!
[1:44:01] Kreynz: i tried to join some rando group on my full bis priest as a dps priest just for fun
[1:44:04] Kreynz: but no group would take me :(
[1:44:20] Kreynz: they're all like 'why dont u heal' lmao
[1:44:27] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[1:45:00] prodigy_wow: not even a plains ring
[1:45:21] g_1_t: did i miss the hydraa react to p2
[1:45:28] deltrexx: are u satisfied with the priest runes, and what runes look most interesting?
[1:45:41] Kreynz: i have 95 parse for shadow but thats while healing it just counts me as shadow cause low healing
[1:45:45] Kreynz: i'd like to try using 0 healing gcds
[1:46:20] Extramediums: Is plains ring gonna be worth 40+g at this point with s2 coming in just over a week?
[1:46:21] fudderx: !talent

[1:46:35] DanUK_47: The Jc buff looks nice
[1:46:37] prodigy_wow: Mindspike is gonna banggg. 36 yrd spammble shadow spell :O
[1:46:37] Kreynz: imo mind spike will be good for pve
[1:47:08] Kreynz: well mind spike will benefit from CoE in pve
[1:47:13] Kreynz: which will help it for pve
[1:47:26] Knossi: i would assume its gonna be very mana efficient dmg castable while locked out of shadow
[1:47:40] Cafe0le: we'll get 6-8 new runes in p2 ?
[1:47:49] prodigy_wow: and its a rune so we know mind spike is going to for -7 mana for no reason
[1:48:19] Nsixtyfour: it doesn’t remove dots either with the rune. spriest burst just became amazing.
[1:48:22] Kreynz: wonder what the cast time on mind spike will be
[1:48:23] Gunnolfz: new priest glyph to fix shadow's problems: "shadow surge"
[1:49:06] Kreynz: yeah it seems awk
[1:49:12] Kreynz: twisted fate should also buff mind spike probs
[1:49:15] prodigy_wow: you shouldnt always compare one to one since each rune has its situational use
[1:49:15] JavaSkrpt: Could be boomy but very setup-dependent
[1:49:20] Nsixtyfour: I didn’t want mind spike. I love mindflay
[1:49:30] Nsixtyfour: agree
[1:49:37] Knossi: true. vt would be much better
[1:49:55] justingatlin: on range i cast mind spike and when melee is next to you and hitting u, u cast mind shear and finish with mindblast into shadowword death @Hydramist
[1:49:59] JavaSkrpt: VT, SWP, VP, flay and blast would be kit

[1:50:40] Nsixtyfour: we get screwed again on pain spell rank in P2 right?
[1:50:48] Kreynz: 3 second cast with a 6 second cd!
[1:50:49] Kreynz: lmao
[1:51:04] Kreynz: whats the flay rank?
[1:51:43] Kreynz: so for pve that might make mindspike better
[1:51:46] Kreynz: just for that reason
[1:52:12] Kreynz: yeah u just do the one with more dmg
[1:52:14] Kreynz: which is boring
[1:52:31] meuusi: What do you think about pain sup ?
[1:52:33] Kreynz: oh the other thing is
[1:52:34] Sinostra: i'm willing to bet you forgot to respec
[1:52:39] Kreynz: i assume mind spike can crit while mind flay cannot crit
[1:52:40] Sinostra: you're smite spec atm
[1:52:44] Kreynz: so thats another bonus for spike for pve
[1:52:45] g_1_t: im super happy with the feral rune they showed too just more PVE dmg
[1:52:51] g_1_t: super unhappy sorry*
[1:53:07] Pepegagodxx: !talents

[1:53:33] g_1_t: its for PVE
[1:53:38] Kreynz: the missile barrage rune for pve for arcane mage looks INSANE
[1:53:44] g_1_t: ya but ferals problem isnt our dmg
[1:53:47] omawamousinda: @Hydramist dont you think wording for PS is kinda off? can we even use it on ourself?
[1:53:47] g_1_t: rn
[1:54:00] g_1_t: imo
[1:54:10] jookmeat: jookmeat subscribed with Prime. 
[1:54:33] ssupermario64: what are your tip to earn money as a priest in vanilla classic?
[1:55:14] Kreynz: @omawamousinda wording is the same as wrath minus the -5% threat part of it
[1:55:20] Kreynz: so im sure u can self use it
[1:55:36] Kreynz: just no use while stunned glyph obviously
[1:55:43] Exodyqq: !tierlist

[1:56:21] Mystylerocks: yo
[1:57:07] Mystylerocks: good, stocked on the latest updates. hype is real ^_^
[1:57:13] ssupermario64: what addon do you have where it shows the aggro procent above their health?
[1:57:16] helichTV: !runes
[1:57:16] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[1:57:53] g_1_t: cat still has no gap closer no slow, no stun, no defensive.. if any class slows us or fears us or roots us we still just have to perma shift out which makes u run out of mana and auto lose kinda like our current problem. Maybe you see something i dont would love to hear your thoughts <3
[1:58:34] Kreynz: imo it would be cool for them to add racial specific runes at some point to buff some existing racials
[1:58:37] Gunnolfz: not everyone needs a gap closer
[1:58:39] Mystylerocks: did u cover/review the new stuff alrdy or laterino?
[1:58:40] Kreynz: like shadowmeld while in combat
[1:59:17] g_1_t: @Gunnolfz a mage roots us then blinks how does cat feral gte back to the mage to do dmg?
[1:59:24] Kreynz: give humans a rune that gives them a pvp trinket xd
[1:59:43] g_1_t: other than the dash we wil lget
[1:59:53] bahamasvvv: @Hydramist  Thoughts on Mind spike rune?
[1:59:57] Sinostra: @Kreynz yeah, 2 min cd please
[1:59:58] Gunnolfz: @g_1_t you unshift? it doesn't cost mana to unshift
[2:00:15] g_1_t: @g_1_t we un shift then... what we have to shift back in right
[2:00:39] Gunnolfz: dude you could just play retail dh if you want everything
[2:00:46] Gunnolfz: i don't know what to tell you
[2:00:48] g_1_t: no im jsut asking friend
[2:00:54] Gunnolfz: asking for cat charge is insanity
[2:00:58] g_1_t: i know i dont know waht to tell myself either
[2:01:34] Sinostra: cat still has passive 30% movement speed  buff
[2:01:57] g_1_t: thats from a talent
[2:02:04] g_1_t: and any clow coutners it
[2:02:11] g_1_t: slow*
[2:02:14] g_1_t: yes
[2:02:33] g_1_t: but why not jsut go bear feral at that point i say right?
[2:02:40] g_1_t: i think.. in my opinion
[2:02:40] prodigy_wow: no
[2:02:49] g_1_t: again this is just my opnion
[2:03:01] Gunnolfz: maybe use your brain and decide which is better for which situation
[2:03:27] prodigy_wow: Druid should use the whole kit, thats the point of druid
[2:03:31] prodigy_wow: play rogue otherwise
[2:03:54] Sinostra: your cats are also doing their thing tbh
[2:04:06] Sinostra: why shouldn't this one aswell ?
[2:04:35] Kreynz: im looking forward to dealing with beastial wrath
[2:04:36] JePsr: how we doin big man ? =D
[2:05:07] Sinostra: you're gonna miss ashenvale, watch out for that
[2:05:12] Kreynz: nope im on alliance shadowstrike D:
[2:05:23] Sinostra: more ashenvale = less solo bgs
[2:05:31] SchmeckoButterboy: SchmeckoButterboy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! p2 hypee, looks really really good tbh, they have learned form p1
[2:05:40] Mystylerocks: u think the shadowfrost dmg is gonna be like
[2:05:44] Mystylerocks: actually +frost?
[2:05:47] flackycl: flackycl watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[2:06:18] Kreynz: @Mystylerocks it's both, and if a target has both shadow and frost resist, the lowest resist gets used for calculation
[2:06:28] Kreynz: and also curse of elements buffs frost
[2:06:33] Kreynz: so that will benefit mind spike
[2:06:47] optik_rec0rds: hydra is that a working version of dispel border which well puts a shiny border over purgeable buffs..
[2:06:48] Kaacia: Well frostfire bolt did slow and dot so maybe it will slow
[2:07:01] Chazzmichael: Im so confused about what to play now 😅
[2:07:20] g_1_t: thank you though for the insight hydra dont mean to sound like im starting an argument just trying to see what other people are thinking how we handle pvp if ur specced Cat feral
[2:07:21] nalexzandre: whats the best prof so far?
[2:07:33] Kaacia: My guild totally shat on me in irl and ingame so I've lost all motivation to play SoD since I have nobody to play with anymore.
[2:07:36] sechsacht68: whats the addon who shows possible dispells?
[2:07:55] finance_amigo: did you stop playing wrath?
[2:08:19] Mystylerocks: kaacia theres always time to find a new community, its phI
[2:08:22] Mystylerocks: fuck em
[2:09:12] Kaacia: @Mystylerocks Yeah I guess, my M+ team is never on in retail and in wrath and SoD my guild fucked me big time so I'm just more or less solo on all versions of wow. I might take a little break and find new people to play with but with season 4 in df and cata and season 2 SoD it's bad timing
[2:09:14] misstherese: hello
[2:09:39] Sinostra: RIP ashenvale
[2:09:44] robzzr: !runes
[2:09:44] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[2:09:47] optik_rec0rds: nah i am talking about the addon that highlighs purgeable buffs not the one that shows enemy buffs ! my clasicauradurations does not do that
[2:09:47] Mystylerocks: ngl a bit happy on the gdkp decision
[2:10:01] Pbunny02: ofc
[2:10:18] xProloli: tailor eng still bis?
[2:10:19] Kreynz: i checked gold prices and the prices have dropped by 50% or so on the 'popular' website
[2:10:45] Dakkroth: wait for real? @Kreynz
[2:10:55] Kreynz: on my server anyway
[2:10:58] Kreynz: idk how universal that is
[2:11:00] Mystylerocks: dakk rubbing his hands, time to invest kekw
[2:11:06] xProloli: yeah it’s down to like 0.05/g
[2:11:24] Dakkroth: nah gold is like 10% less
[2:11:26] Mystylerocks: can u up the music a bit :D
[2:11:37] toonits: KEKW
[2:12:07] Dakkroth: gdkps will still happen tho, just gna be discord pumped again
[2:12:09] Mystylerocks: love this remix
[2:12:11] Dakkroth: trusted gdkp leaders etc
[2:12:24] Sinostra: just /afk and hearth
[2:12:24] Mystylerocks: @Dakkroth yea but ppl will infiltrate and snitch kekw
[2:12:30] Kreynz: yeah i mean how can they possibly enforce it
[2:12:32] Dakkroth: cuz im assuming theyre gna restrict it by banning advertising in trade chat and maybe unable to trade gold for items in raids
[2:12:47] Kreynz: the best they'll be able to do is just not allow people to advertise it in-game imo
[2:12:50] htvizzle: people would just take the gold first right
[2:12:51] darkstarklife: GDKP for TRADE GOODs instead of gold
[2:13:00] toonits: "bidding starts on x item, minbid 10 Magic dust!"
[2:13:28] Sinostra: nah, people are gonna bid gold bars
[2:13:37] timbroslice: damn priest is getting pain supp
[2:13:56] Dlax: trollsweat GDKP
[2:14:12] darkstarklife: mindspike gonna be crazy strong depending on cast time
[2:14:14] TV_Kuro: 1.5 cast 100%
[2:14:16] waffleberryx: if u can cast mind spike when kicked on shadow like in retail then that gna be busted
[2:14:16] timbroslice: they are gonna be required to win bg’s even more I feel
[2:14:24] segelduk: i'll match your bid of 2000 peaceflowers and raise you by 400 iron bars
[2:14:25] htvizzle: mind spike into blackout into a HUGE mb/death, spri even scarier than it was gnna be with just twisted faith or w/e it is
[2:14:29] Sinostra: what if mind spike is instant without a cd ?
[2:14:33] prodigy_wow: Effects that increase either Shadow or Frost damage also increase Shadowfrost damage. Shadowfrost damage is calculated using your enemy's Shadow or Frost resistance, whichever is lower. Immunities that only apply to Shadow or Frost are ignored by Shadowfrost damage
[2:14:34] darkstarklife: that burst
[2:14:48] prodigy_wow: Thats what wiki told me
[2:14:48] Dakkroth: ferals lookin hella litty next phase
[2:14:50] darkstarklife: x3 mindspike , MB , SWD boom
[2:14:55] Dakkroth: litty kitty time
[2:15:05] htvizzle: problem is chicken looks even better LUL
[2:15:05] Kreynz: 1.5 sec cast seems too fast
[2:15:06] garmok1979: "back by popular demand, Eclipse!" Kappa
[2:15:10] Kreynz: i'd expect 2 or 2.5 sec cast
[2:15:58] Abstrection: gdkp was what made gold making fun for me so i dont really know about this change
[2:16:02] prodigy_wow: @Kreynz Its always been 1.5
[2:16:22] Kreynz: arcane blast is 1.5 in wrath
[2:16:24] Kreynz: but on sod it's 2.5
[2:17:03] htvizzle: its 1.5 on wrath cause of haste no?
[2:17:09] htvizzle: baseline its higher i thought
[2:17:17] Kreynz: maybe i swear it's 1.5 tho
[2:17:19] Kreynz: ill double check
[2:17:39] Kreynz: wait no im wrong it's 2.5
[2:17:41] segelduk: thoughts on the new big red harambe meta inc at 40?
[2:17:43] Kreynz: i guess u just have so much haste on wrath xd
[2:17:52] htvizzle: ye ofc haste is goated stat
[2:18:20] Kreynz: ya cause u get gcd capped on blast in wrath thats how much haste u have lmao
[2:18:20] ezypzxd: I really hope that mindspike is a filler and do good dmg and very cheap on mana
[2:18:22] Kreynz: u just have so much of it
[2:18:52] Kreynz: well if mind spike is 1.5 that means it will have poor sp scaling right
[2:18:54] ezypzxd: otherwise we back on mana struggle
[2:19:15] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[2:19:16] lHlUlLlK: just missed it
[2:19:57] Studiovirtanen: :O
[2:20:22] Sinostra: why don't you change guild then ?
[2:20:26] Kreynz: i'd like to see VT with the TBC mana battery mechanic
[2:20:37] ironpallyone: Join Wooddepartment those guys are pretty good
[2:23:04] Seriumosa: You can ctrl click the NovaWorldBuffs icon to see what layer guildies are in and /w them for better chance of layer hops
[2:25:04] reggieface420: if u can ps yourself as shadow that'd be pretty good
[2:25:11] reggieface420: there's never been a way to test that right
[2:25:22] reggieface420: u can never access ps + shadowform in the regular game
[2:26:29] bolleboris1: u going sp or disc for p2?
[2:26:46] Thorxs: rip to all the ppl leveing 17 shamans to spam GDKPs for money
[2:27:04] JePsr: this music SeemsGood cartSnus
[2:27:19] Thorxs: if u are the one running them yes
[2:27:24] Mystylerocks: nah its not so many are scuffed, unless u re in some discord with juicy oilers
[2:27:31] Kreynz: i make more gold boosting stocks than i do leeching gdkps
[2:27:35] Kreynz: the gold from leeching gdkps is not that much
[2:28:02] reggieface420: boosts is the next thing that reddit is coming for
[2:28:12] Thorxs: tbh i mad 800g with alch
[2:28:17] herespapi: Jokerd says that GDKP is getting bannable in ph2
[2:28:26] Kreynz: i'd say boosting stocks is aboutg 100-150g per hour
[2:28:34] g_1_t: Swiftthistle at almsot 5 g  a stack
[2:28:36] flowen001: evening all
[2:28:39] g_1_t: on cruasder strike thats my muse
[2:29:09] zerkum: the mana ticker u got, what addon is it?
[2:29:15] prodigy_wow: p2
[2:29:18] Thorxs: p2 i believe
[2:29:19] reggieface420: its on the 8th
[2:29:33] reggieface420: im really curious how they would ever enforce something like this
[2:29:36] Thorxs: can u go over the talentsw u are going to run for leveling/ are u making a short on it?
[2:29:44] Kreynz: if they can't even ban gold buyers how are they gonna ban gdkp
[2:29:49] cendrifione: GDKP on Discord now
[2:30:14] cendrifione: EZ clap
[2:30:50] Sinostra: btw, penance andd pain supp will not be considered disc spells in sod
[2:31:13] Kroovy: I really hope Mind Spike is a rune you can get early on
[2:31:28] reggieface420: level 26 is a new rank of sw:p, can maybe make shared pain own in dungeons
[2:31:38] Sinostra: i can tell you that because haunt is not considered affliction
[2:31:51] Sinostra: haunt is not affected by suppression
[2:31:55] Thorxs: Given what we have seen so far, do u think Spirest will be somewhat viable, or usless like at 25?
[2:32:05] prodigy_wow: https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=33206/pain-suppression
[2:32:06] Sinostra: it''s just nothing
[2:32:07] prodigy_wow: school says holy
[2:32:08] ratpapii: Is mind flay obsolete with this?
[2:32:14] reggieface420: with like 125 spell power + the swp talents, at level 26, shared pain should be 500 damage or so per SWP
[2:32:23] reggieface420: the school always said holy
[2:32:31] reggieface420: its what u get locked out of when u get csed
[2:32:32] ratpapii: MF only gonna be useful for slows
[2:32:33] Sinostra: @Prodigy________________ school and talents aren't the same
[2:32:35] Kreynz: shield is also holy school but u can still use in shadowform because it's a disc spell
[2:32:43] Kreynz: shield is disc spell that is holy school
[2:32:44] prodigy_wow: Yeah okay thats true
[2:33:36] Kreynz: that crit talent affects penance on wrath though
[2:33:38] Kreynz: so that's probably why
[2:34:23] Kreynz: if u follow the logic of wrath etc. and they dont change anything then penance would be usable in sform
[2:34:23] ratpapii: PS in shadow form would be nutty for pvp
[2:34:26] Kreynz: but they should change it
[2:34:28] DistrictDingo: penance in shadowform would be wild!
[2:34:32] reggieface420: if PS is in the game its likely that dispersion will make it in at some point
[2:34:48] jallaballan: but void plague procs blackout doesnt it
[2:34:59] Larr_y_: I really hope dual talents comes soon
[2:35:03] Kreynz: i wonder if they would add dispersion, cause having dispersion for disc would be so broken lmao
[2:35:06] justingatlin: PS is Disc ability so it has to be useable in shadow form
[2:35:07] Kreynz: but it would be fine for shadow
[2:35:51] Kreynz: potentially dispersion should be on the same rune slot as PS I guess
[2:35:52] Kreynz: if they add it
[2:35:59] Sinostra: @jallaballan because it says shadow damage spells, implying shadow school, not shadow book
[2:36:18] streetjamez: best professions for phase 2?
[2:36:23] felstavd: @hydramist when we get blink as priest? That would be cool pr even heroic leap
[2:36:51] Kreynz: i'd love for priests to get life grip tho xd
[2:36:59] streetjamez: You think they'd introduce arena in the last phase?

[2:53:18] xBarLey: GDKP will be restricted starting with Phase 2
[2:53:47] lazarus_v: hopefully its better than mindflay. Also if its 30yd range perfect
[2:53:49] MVPeteTV: whats the addon for dispellable buffs highlighting?
[2:54:45] Zelimeth: what are your overall /TLDR thoughts on the phase 2 release notes
[2:54:45] optik_rec0rds: mind to share it in your discord ? :p
[2:54:47] Scrawlyqt: Hey what do you think about enchanting now to replace engineer with the new enchant 20 spell power, i feel its so powerful at 40
[2:55:19] MannySJ: Gladge
[2:55:40] Deftvx: Is there a secondary bis pvp prof to enchanting
[2:55:48] theEntropie: They will probably have some weird engineering stuff for  wayland supplies, still worth it for gold at least. Made 200g selling turbochargers
[2:55:48] optik_rec0rds: the tailor heads look insane
[2:56:02] MannySJ: You can share it Okayge
[2:56:03] Deftvx: ** i mean is there a 2nd bis profession after engineering for pvp
[2:56:18] Deftvx: bet ty
[2:56:35] theEntropie: Boots + pain suppression
[2:57:16] MannySJ: It's kinda scuffed since buffs glow on my hunter too
[2:59:05] perseay797: You don't have friends to dungeon pump with? Sadge
[2:59:35] theEntropie: Barrage on mage looks sick, will boost him after priest
[2:59:41] MannySJ: Quest with friends Gladge
[3:00:32] theEntropie: best pvp professions are those that give you gold for faps xD
[3:00:38] jarlo123: @Hydramist u think locks will be bad at 40? these new runes was so boring
[3:00:46] MannySJ: Originally it should be glowing only on "Stealable" buffs, so hostile and dispelable. Just changed it to magic
[3:01:06] theEntropie: I use faps on mage when pulling dungeons
[3:01:15] MannySJ: I think stealable isn't a real condition in vanilla
[3:01:50] g_1_t: awwww
[3:02:41] JustOndore: 22 raiders from JustOndore have joined! 
[3:02:45] Omgezzz: u think im safe rank 2 to 3 with 6.2 k honor ?

[3:03:39] JustOndore: Not too happy about warlock runes tho hydraF
[3:03:41] varatupaj: its 10 - 6
[3:03:47] perseay797: Do you they will be adding new runes for chest, gloves and legs or only for new slots, boots and belt? @Hydramist

[3:04:27] bisonkron: sham gets a new chest rune
[3:04:29] JustOndore: They  are adding chest runes. Shaman is getting a chest rune. The 2 hand mastery
[3:04:45] theEntropie: we get 3 slots per phase
[3:05:06] Sinostra: @theEntropie are you sure ? so far we've only seen 2 slots P2
[3:05:19] jarlo123: @Hydramist u think locks will be bad at 40? these new runes was so boring
[3:05:23] theEntropie: There was some older blue post about it pre release
[3:05:35] theEntropie: we should have 9 slots in total with XX number of runes
[3:05:45] Studiovirtanen: @theEntropie NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:06:13] lazarus_v: @theEntropie theres no way they add 3 more slots. my guess is 1 max 2
[3:06:22] theEntropie: let me find it quick
[3:06:28] Sinostra: the more, the merrier
[3:06:44] lazarus_v: i prefer more but i doubt they will do that much since total runes gonna be 30
[3:06:52] theEntropie: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/future-rune-engraving-slots-datamined-on-the-classic-season-of-discovery-ptr-336045
[3:07:08] perseay797: There are wrists, shoulders and head. So at least 9.
[3:07:17] perseay797: At least 3 more* For a total of 8
[3:07:20] theEntropie: Ok this was a PTR datamine (chest, legs, hands, bracer, cloak, feet, helm, shoulder, waist)
[3:07:24] jarlo123: @Hydramist u think locks will be bad at 40? these new runes was so boring
[3:07:54] perseay797: @jarlo123 These are only few runes revealed though.
[3:07:59] lazarus_v: 9 would be good. prayge
[3:08:05] JustOndore: Don't sleep on destro meta lock
[3:08:42] leeroyjenkinsohyeah: all I want is just to nuke people with my imba chain lightnings in a few weeks
[3:09:18] perseay797: I'm really happy to see QoL class books like totem recall and paladin buff extenders.
[3:10:17] Snewch: Interesting new runes
[3:10:49] MannySJ: No purple staff? o7
[3:11:36] Snewch: Enhance might be scary with these new runes damn
[3:12:09] perseay797: We're getting 15+ more new epics from Gnomeregan. Huuuuge.
[3:12:32] JavaSkrpt: Blackout madness, what a treat
[3:12:39] MannySJ: Gonna be fun seeing tunnel frost trapped from 40 yards away, proccing non dr non dispelable entrapment
[3:13:34] JavaSkrpt: I honestly thought VT was referencing void tendrils for a minute earlier
[3:13:58] perseay797: Yeah like 30 y is more like it.
[3:14:05] Tnormous92: Fred Again <3
[3:14:05] leeroyjenkinsohyeah: @Snewch problem with enhance is mobility, so easily kited
[3:14:07] perseay797: 40 yards is higher than you can shoot
[3:14:38] Snewch: @leeroyjenkinsohyeah yeah but I have a feeling spellhence will be big, windfury 2h crits with big lava burst/chain
[3:14:59] MannySJ: Ah yeah maelstrom lets you lava burst KEKW
[3:16:07] perseay797: Maelstrom lava burst is big but i don't think it will be that good with 2handers, coz attack rate is slow. Dual wield tho - will let you spam lava burst on cd.
[3:16:28] MannySJ: Will always crit too if you keep flameshock up
[3:16:45] leeroyjenkinsohyeah: enhance wont be gearing for spelldamage though
[3:17:06] optik_rec0rds: our ehance wants to..
[3:17:11] optik_rec0rds: enhance*
[3:18:03] perseay797: For sure, but since no talent from elemental or spell power from gear, it'll be much weaker than from Elemental. Elemental will have high huge potential. I already calculated that their CL with 150 spell power will crit for 1k. Add lava burst to it and it's gonna be 80% hp of even tanky targets.

[3:19:13] perseay797: Randies be randies, as you call them :D
[3:19:31] Rebukenx: Do we know if its possible to use pain suppression while stunned?
[3:20:40] xaviwoo: @Rebukenx I think it is
[3:21:25] theEntropie: I get stunned by my wife all the time and can still suppress pain
[3:21:54] felstavd: 48 more wins for exalted. or a lot more games if im going to lose many xD

[3:23:22] EruhiniTV: @Hydramist yo sup hmm p2 stv looks good so far we know or?
[3:23:53] perseay797: Gotta get ready your pvp gear and build for STV even right? Basically solo event.
[3:24:33] EruhiniTV: @Hydramist i am decked out and rdy for it ;-)
[3:24:43] khalidhaxe: why no more wrath hydra
[3:24:47] perseay797: They didn't specify whether 5man grouppers wil lget a penalty. So we don';t know yet?

[3:25:28] Fomse: p2*
[3:25:29] khalidhaxe: true
[3:25:30] Nsixtyfour: They only stated raid groups = bad
[3:25:30] perseay797: What's scripting about? Like third party software?
[3:25:38] Snewch: Are you tempted to go play retail when you see how it is there right now LUL
[3:25:48] Nsixtyfour: I’m looking forward to 5man pvp groups
[3:26:24] infuze27: with the free for all format of stv I suspect a lot of 5 separate groups of 5 still “teaming up” also a lot of win trading kills lol
[3:26:28] JavaSkrpt: External software to support client-side execution based on server responses, allows for split-second interrupts and the like
[3:26:44] ironpallyone: I love they are trying things like PVP ques, and no GDKP.  Hopefully at the end we can find a better game

[3:27:33] saund: class or something
[3:27:52] Ironchin420: your music taste is nice, fred again is sick
[3:27:52] noose9k: Bro p2 looks so hype actually
[3:28:00] garmok1979: Resto Sham? XD
[3:28:01] lHlUlLlK: didnt paladins rule the world in cata pvp?
[3:28:33] VersusGamesFL: Im sure you already talked about it, what are your thoughts on Mind Spike? @Hydramist
[3:28:33] JavaSkrpt: Is Arathi Basin not available? Belt and boots, right?
[3:28:50] saund: i think clamweave is actualyl worth to get agian, because the tailor 225 headpiece will break 2 set if we keep epic boots too @Hydramist
[3:28:53] saund: for tank gear
[3:28:56] perseay797: @javaskrpt Now - no, will be in p2.
[3:29:00] noose9k: Lol hell yeah
[3:29:08] VersusGamesFL: crossing fingers for discoverable VT rune
[3:29:16] rns_aurelius: im surprised s priest didnt get anything for mana sustain
[3:29:35] VersusGamesFL: @rns_aurelius i thought we were forsureeee going to get VT this time
[3:29:41] Nsixtyfour: all I wanted was like “x% of damage dealt by mind blast returned as mana”
[3:29:42] theEntropie: fortitude mana reduction buff plx
[3:29:48] JustOndore: All I want is demonic circle for locks
[3:29:54] Tnormous92: This Freds boiler room set?!
[3:29:59] Ironchin420: yes!
[3:30:22] Nsixtyfour: I don’t want VT but more likely they add the mana return to a dot
[3:30:37] JavaSkrpt: Disc dispersion, lol
[3:30:39] wheeezyp: Seal of Sylvanas has 8 stam on it, with 3 str kinda meh but its free
[3:30:46] perseay797: You can get about 1750 with all buffs and stam gear, i do with my mage.
[3:30:47] JavaSkrpt: Self-cast PS + evocate
[3:30:59] leeroyjenkinsohyeah: WORCHIEF Kreygasm
[3:31:06] JavaSkrpt: Fishing tourney hat with massive stam
[3:31:31] prodigy_wow: p2 probably
[3:31:36] JavaSkrpt: If you haven't seen people running with it, then prolly not yet.
[3:31:47] prodigy_wow: they turned off the fishing stuff
[3:32:01] JavaSkrpt: Gnomer helm might be twinked out with the new epics
[3:32:38] JavaSkrpt: Cheeky as fuck
[3:32:40] JustOndore: LUL
[3:32:42] JavaSkrpt: LOL
[3:33:02] JavaSkrpt: Snatched ya leaf
[3:33:57] xBarLey: what does the % mean next to the FCs?
[3:34:22] Snewch: Their HP
[3:34:39] xBarLey: @Snewch ty!
[3:35:03] perseay797: That's smells like an L this one.
[3:35:36] JavaSkrpt: I don't know if I like the % without the # of HP
[3:38:05] xBarLey: aaand what do the numbers mean above their names and healthbars?
[3:38:24] MannySJ: I went human priest, big regret Sadge
[3:38:34] Caendras_: its the distance between him and his target
[3:38:35] xBarLey: like 5 - 15 / 20 - 30 and so on?
[3:38:41] xBarLey: Ah okay ty!
[3:38:55] theEntropie: first time went horde, love it. Thunderbluff is super nice
[3:39:04] xBarLey: I got a lot Noob Questions LUL

[3:42:32] NeddTheNerd: ahh yes authetic wsg gameplay
[3:44:19] TheZtiff: biggest hype announce for season 2?
[3:49:32] NeddTheNerd: they didnt tease druid runes Sadge
[3:50:05] JavaSkrpt: Melee hunter piqued my interest, for sure.
[3:50:09] lHlUlLlK: why everyone always hating on the huntards
[3:50:15] lHlUlLlK: let them have something
[3:50:17] theEntropie: warlock runes are F tier
[3:50:19] cryptomeganinja: because thats what we do
[3:50:28] NeddTheNerd: @lHlUlLlK no one likes getting solod by a pet
[3:50:39] JavaSkrpt: Trap Launcher, instant attacks w/ no cooldown, can mana dump Mongoose into mages
[3:50:47] JavaSkrpt: Pet, too. Right
[3:51:23] JavaSkrpt: Wing Clip is a great snare, right weapon on, I can see survival pumping
[3:51:42] NeddTheNerd: fred again set, a connoiseur i see
[3:52:11] JavaSkrpt: Fiend! Love it
[3:52:12] justingatlin: @Hydramist what is your expectation for frostmage on 40  in pvp ?
[3:52:31] shrroom: Evening!
[3:52:47] shrroom: STV on paper looked kinda cool
[3:52:56] shrroom: good that they gutted raid grps for that
[3:52:57] NeddTheNerd: do you believe starsurge deserves a nerf ?
[3:53:55] NeddTheNerd: i play boomie and i do agree its a bit overtuned, i hope they bring stuff that balances it out tho
[3:54:31] DeathToad007: eclipse is a crap mechanic though hope they dpo something new
[3:54:45] shrroom: I think feral is going to be really strong
[3:55:04] NeddTheNerd: that would be so sick
[3:55:06] Kavsen: Excited  to see Ele sham runes, since they only displayed enhance runes
[3:55:10] StingoX: druid is ok :D
[3:55:35] StingoX: yeah. starfire cast is too long. to be valuable
[3:55:50] StingoX: vs value you get.
[3:55:53] NeddTheNerd: i kinda hope they dont add starfall tho
[3:56:17] DeathToad007: overload
[3:56:24] JavaSkrpt: Maelstrom, Overload
[3:56:24] StingoX: DAESuppy @neddthenerd that would be too much ye
[3:56:27] Studiovirtanen: tru
[3:56:27] TheZtiff: The design atm is instant spells like stargsurge takes 50% hp and 3 sec cast not even 10%
[3:56:32] JavaSkrpt: I'm excited for it. As an Ele main.
[3:56:36] shrroom: hmm brb levleing my shaman now
[3:56:43] JavaSkrpt: At the end of it all, elemental was my class
[3:56:44] StingoX: @theztiff yep. sadge

[3:56:58] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[3:57:02] StingoX: good luck casting fireball for example.
[3:57:04] JavaSkrpt: Mobile lightning bolt was a great time, short lived but great
[3:57:14] StingoX: in the meantime you got 2 starsurges
[3:57:18] perseay797: Crit chain lightning for 1k, overload procs that 1.5k in a single cast. Add lava burst to it that's like another 1k damage. It's gonna get busted 100%.
[3:57:23] NeddTheNerd: starfire castable while moving YEP
[3:57:36] JavaSkrpt: It'll be fun to watch for the first week or so.
[3:57:52] fakemejo: wonder what fire mage is going to get
[3:58:28] Caendras_: Which account do you level first on phase 2?
[3:58:40] NeddTheNerd: im having so much FOMO from SoD its insane.. i wanna play so many different classes and specs
[3:58:45] shrroom: heck yeah eu
[3:59:01] shrroom: 44
[3:59:04] NeddTheNerd: 44
[4:00:06] saund: think prot warriors might become a thing at 40 for pvp?
[4:00:08] Caendras_: Which runes would you prefer on shadow priest?
[4:00:13] saund: some tanky fucker action
[4:00:16] shrroom: same @NeddTheNerd lol
[4:00:57] perseay797: Adding disperse wouldn't make much sense though. They already add PS that will be avaiable to SP right?
[4:01:14] JavaSkrpt: SoD seems like proper fun. Strange that it's the only playable option of the versions available
[4:02:18] saund: tbh i ran out of stuff to do in SOD on 3 alts, i might do some wrath bg's until P2 is out now
[4:02:26] saund: should've released this week
[4:02:31] apit0v: apit0v subscribed with Prime. 
[4:03:33] Caendras_: Whats your guess for casting penance in shadow form?
[4:03:34] perseay797: @saund Did a proper prep? Mats for professions, good amount of gold for training and mount? @saund
[4:03:44] DeathToad007: i dont have bis on any of my 3 toons or exalted wsg.  Happy for the extra week to fill in the gaps.
[4:03:48] HunterEZ: I personally think it should have been released already in the beginning of januari
[4:04:18] saund: @DeathToad007 i'm not prepping quests, i have around 50 gold for my first mount but im dungeon grinding (then im doing all 30-40 quests on my mount to make enough for my alts) so not much to do
[4:04:31] saund: exalted wsg on all 3
[4:04:36] saund: honored timbermaw on my main
[4:04:42] saund: i proper sweated it LuL
[4:04:59] HunterEZ: Saund the type of guy to do his homework the same day and then do 3 more friends b4 deadline
[4:05:03] Caendras_: So Penance counts as holy spell with this push back talent. I think that this way it wouldnt be castable as shadow
[4:05:07] perseay797: @DeathToad007 I didn't do exact calculations but i think your 50g will melt away on buying new ranks for spells on 40.
[4:05:47] saund: i did it in a raid group for 3 days straight, 5 rep per mob and you need 24k rep
[4:05:52] rafak_1: you get gold while leveling for spells
[4:05:54] saund: took like 40 hours?
[4:05:55] ch0wder92: pennance should benifit from inspiration
[4:05:59] Caendras_: ah sry my bad
[4:06:06] saund: they're lvl 50 mobs
[4:06:24] perseay797: ASHENVAAALE HYYYPE
[4:06:25] saund: the medicine pouch doesn't even work the on use, but its still 10 stam which is nice, hope it works at 40
[4:06:29] perseay797: Lagfest we're coming
[4:06:31] saund: but need rep in future anyways
[4:06:49] HunterEZ: 40h rep grind thats insane
[4:06:54] goffy1993: ever seen Warcraft bro you look like the king of alliance
[4:06:56] perseay797: Madge
[4:07:19] HunterEZ: @goffy1993 He even have the stormwind accent KEKW
[4:08:06] perseay797: @saund Do it on your all 3 characters pussy :D
[4:08:14] kolarovmcfc: hydra what is your favorite futbol club?
[4:09:03] HunterEZ: Well RIP jurgen
[4:09:06] saund: @saund NAH mate it takes like 2-3 hours to get everyone on the correct spot and summoned
[4:09:12] saund: and then you have to replace people all day long
[4:09:19] saund: annoying process
[4:09:27] HunterEZ: What will liverpool do without jurgen
[4:09:48] HunterEZ: Always thought Ryan was an arsenal fan
[4:10:02] powerlinepreston: no rep passed reveres
[4:10:06] powerlinepreston: only the quest item
[4:10:39] Noitheknight333: i miss zae commentating
[4:10:41] robocoptitletheme: i usually heal one target that is in combat, and i get +5 rep from the little ones
[4:10:54] Noitheknight333: ii hope they add arena or 1v1 arenas at later levels
[4:11:09] NeddTheNerd: unironically i like the care package drops in retail
[4:11:18] robocoptitletheme: but not from the boss, gotta damage the boss
[4:11:18] Kataemoi: You're saying 1v1 arenas because you're a priest. How about 2v2 arenas? A bit more balanced I would say
[4:11:34] perseay797: You can 15 rep from each elite trash mob around the bosses
[4:12:17] Drunk_Mantis: i really like the 1v1 arena with pre-match vendor available
[4:12:25] prodigy_wow: Sounds like a fun private server
[4:12:26] Drunk_Mantis: gives classes tools to work around their hard counters
[4:12:49] NeddTheNerd: rip warriors in 1v1 LUL
[4:13:30] NeddTheNerd: you just killed savix LUL
[4:13:37] Kataemoi: I am 100% certain they will add arenas at 60 if we are vocal about it. We just need people to constantly post it on the forums.
[4:13:50] NeVolent: what i want is to reduce cc duration of sap and sheep..
[4:14:42] Kataemoi: What do you mean rated BGs? As in arena ratings?
[4:15:02] NeVolent: yea when u win u get rating
[4:15:10] TareqAK: TareqAK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! o hai Luna, Kiki, TinyKitten, Eli, and everyone. How are you all doing? I am still struggling, but I have plenty to be thankful for.
[4:15:22] perseay797: On Lone Wolf Horde always starts at Zoram and does HS to Splinter.
[4:16:00] perseay797: 0 targets hit, negative
[4:17:29] feodred10: So Enha Sham, disc+shadow, and hunter just got moved to S++ tier as of last night
[4:17:45] feodred10: oh and POTENTIALLY Ret / shockadin
[4:19:25] ngeisler11: do you think the fact they announced new pvp event as more solo focused - does that change any of your rankings?
[4:19:36] lz_vie: might be an image
[4:19:40] perseay797: Survival looking veeery interested i'm tempted to roll it in p2. Going melee + doing traps in combat is super cool. Immolation trap will do 500+ dmg each time it's triggered.
[4:20:39] perseay797: @Kataemoi Elo based matchming for BG's basically

[5:25:42] Kyfoon: they said in a blue post they have tech to track it in and out of dungeons/raids

[5:45:26] flenbober: holy priest dps?
[5:45:37] thecornmaster: priest v lock will be unplayable
[5:45:39] Kroovy: Oh my god dude. Summon Felguard: "The Felguard benefits from all talents and effects that trigger from or benefit any of your other Demon minions."
[5:45:48] Kroovy: that's so stupid
[5:45:48] Shnuphphy: hey man how are you, what do you think about the new priest runes so far is it pve / pvp wise liable?
[5:45:51] vrsswow: @Kyfoon  ty mate
[5:46:04] Nyria001: Are bracers runes for p2 ?
[5:46:04] Kyfoon: @raquu helm is lvl 50 phase I believe?
[5:46:15] Kyfoon: @vrsswow Dreamstate rune:  Your damaging spell critical strikes grant you 50% of your mana regeneration while casting for 8 sec and increase Nature damage dealt to the target by 20% for 12 sec.
[5:46:44] Rslsoccer: they could be trolling us with some of these runes
[5:47:06] Kyfoon: yes
[5:47:15] justingatlin: @Hydramist blizzard should add "damage done " to the scoreboard in WSG/AB
[5:47:22] raquu: @Kyfoon Oh right, didn't even think about that
[5:47:32] Kroovy: I don't think they'd "troll" like that, but they'd absolutely implement spells that they have no intention of making available just yet
[5:47:43] Dakkroth: at least they barely added mobility stuff, which is very gud
[5:48:06] Dakkroth: shadowstep for rogues i guess
[5:48:29] optik_rec0rds: step and deep should not be in the game tbh
[5:48:31] Sinostra: @Dakkroth rogues have two shadowsteps ????
[5:48:34] Sinostra: wtf
[5:48:47] Sinostra: both on belt and pants
[5:49:09] justingatlin: can u link it please :)
[5:49:09] Sinostra: bro, you can still burst a lock
[5:49:19] Sinostra: also, ms affects DL's heal
[5:49:35] Kroovy: It's not just UA, it's that locks can get Pandemic to make DoTs critically strike. It's insanity
[5:49:35] flenbober: 30 yards is kinda far
[5:49:45] bisonkron: UA is on bracers, so maybe won't happen P2
[5:49:51] prodigy_wow: Amazing
[5:49:53] prodigy_wow: Shockadin is real
[5:49:53] Kroovy: wait what
[5:50:04] flenbober: LOL
[5:50:06] optik_rec0rds: @Kroovy we got no crit tho

[5:51:02] prodigy_wow: Rogue rune
[5:51:04] thesunnyside: That looks like rogue surely?
[5:51:04] Kavsen: @Kyfoon in these runes.. they basically got nothing compared to everyone else getting JUICED
[5:51:04] lz_vie: its dumb
[5:51:05] Noitheknight333: no way they release belt bracers helm
[5:51:06] Cupz21: I was told some of these are to throw us off. Guessing that is fake
[5:51:06] flenbober: ???????
[5:51:08] ama__deus: dispersion on the same slot as pain suppression, though
[5:51:09] prodigy_wow: Mouse over

[5:52:12] Plushie__Tv: class tuning post is now up
[5:52:14] Rslsoccer: i’m not going holy
[5:52:30] ama__deus: I mean, it's good that spirit redemption has a use outside of you know... dying LUL
[5:52:40] Kyfoon: @Kavsen yeah i feel some of the belt runes should be on feet instead so they synergise otherwise its a bit meh
[5:52:44] prodigy_wow: PvE rune
[5:52:59] ama__deus: hope it's not a channel, though
[5:53:00] Kroovy: Void Zone proccing blackouts would be amazing honestly
[5:53:01] thesunnyside: Void Zone + Mind Sear must be insane aoe right?
[5:53:11] ama__deus: critical dots sound awesome, though
[5:53:26] oornli1992: we want haste
[5:53:37] ama__deus: Dispersion + shadow fiend? Sign me up
[5:53:44] WrightLEG: shadow looking abit meh? :/

[5:56:04] SoloKwt: shaman still has 7 xd
[5:56:05] pew2700: Druid looking good.  Shaman looking really good esp Ele.  Rogue looking really good.  Locks/priests getting critical hits on dots really good
[5:56:08] ama__deus: Ah, Deeper WIlds is one of those vanity runes, I am guessing
[5:56:17] Kyfoon: yes
[5:56:19] grievousww: yh
[5:56:32] SamAkaforty: it wont take a rune slot

[5:56:44] o0darling0o: druid berserk = 15 sec fear immune
[5:56:44] Kyfoon: effect
[5:56:59] Kyfoon: yah looks like it

[6:00:02] Studiovirtanen: :O
[6:00:06] Kyfoon: ahh ok
[6:00:09] Kroovy: Does twice as much damage, but deals half as much damage back to you. So you take the same general amount that you were before
[6:00:27] EruhiniTV: @Hydramist ah ok than it seems right for me
[6:00:44] Rugmouse: hunter stuff might be some duplicates then as well
[6:00:48] thecornmaster: ye I think thats all old changes except the 50%
[6:00:59] Baxxtah: cheaper buff+duration is low key mvp

[6:03:11] Mapton30: I guess u put Portal then you go afk and make your slaves click instead of you KEKW
[6:03:15] MaDMonKeySC2: its the wardrobe
[6:03:16] Baxxtah: you get the "meeting stone"
[6:03:17] narffius: it's wrath stone they put down
[6:03:18] shawtayuk: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/massive-warlock-quality-of-life-skill-book-datamined-for-phase-2-season-of-337456
[6:03:18] Kyfoon: yes its a summing stone basically
[6:03:21] shawtayuk: yes. portal door
[6:03:23] yiannos1979: best race for shaman ? either ele or ench? horde that is
[6:03:24] lz_vie: yeah, like the coffin in other expacs
[6:03:32] Plushie__Tv: just the standard summon portal, needs 2 people and the lock to "summon" it, then you can summon other people instead of using a soulshard for each one
[6:03:38] Snewch: Lmao
[6:03:43] Studiovirtanen: lol
[6:03:49] Zalelol: make it so you need the epic soulshard bag to get them
[6:03:51] Kroovy: Lol you only say that because they're getting UA
[6:03:55] Sinostra: yeah
[6:03:58] Baxxtah: dont talk like that about new main

[6:05:03] Minikuznitsel: Finally priest can buff everyone in one manapool xD
[6:05:05] Dreameaterz: Well im happy with dispersion, thats frikking huge
[6:05:07] flenbober: shamans can redirec ttotems
[6:05:22] Kroovy: I agree though, I'd really REALLY like to see them try more new things with the classes rather than just making every class more like what they are in retail
[6:05:26] Zalelol: rogues got trolled so hard lmao
[6:05:28] ama__deus: I mean, I'd be gassed if feral druids got that in PVE as well
[6:05:32] screwu666: rogues can play retail if they wanna
[6:05:48] murxll99: pshero only gangs lowies 1v1. why need redirect?
[6:05:56] gegonn1991: But there are all runes till 60 right?? :D
[6:06:04] yiannos1979: best race for shaman ? either ele or ench? horde that is
[6:06:07] Dreameaterz: not sure what to pick dispers vs pain supp, gonna be interesting
[6:06:09] bigmoodx: hpal looks massively buffed lol
[6:06:18] Dreameaterz: think Ps for disc, disperse for shadow?
[6:06:32] motod0x: + wep
[6:06:37] SoloKwt: there is more runes coming right?
[6:06:56] Kroovy: Shadow is gonna be so much fun
[6:07:05] WrightLEG: think it would be good from a pve standpoint?
[6:07:06] thesunnyside: Shadow#s gonna be insane, especially if mind flay can crit
[6:07:08] yiannos1979: best race for shaman ? either ele or ench? horde that is
[6:07:22] prodigy_wow: Which is so crazy
[6:07:24] StingoX: show druid pls
[6:07:25] ch0wder92: crazy
[6:07:33] Dreameaterz: crits on dots is insanely huge
[6:07:44] bisonkron: @yiannos1979 orc for pvp. troll for pve. tauren for fun & warstomp
[6:07:45] falapala: This has to be bait
[6:07:45] fiskensfriend: mage looks craaazy
[6:07:47] Kroovy: I still feel like Mind Spike + Twisted Faith sounds too juicy.
[6:07:48] Hanleyy: what u think bout disc?
[6:07:52] Dreameaterz: feel like SP might just be the winner of the next phase lmao
[6:07:52] flenbober: what about boombeasts?
[6:07:54] prodigy_wow: Imagine you dot someone and then press Inner focus and dont use it and all your dots crit 25% more
[6:07:58] madow90: !runes
[6:07:58] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[6:08:11] varatupaj: lock gets the same thing with dot crits, i dont think dots should crit
[6:08:12] Kyfoon: helm isnt this phase tho
[6:08:19] lz_vie: yeah, pally healing was crap tho
[6:08:20] thesunnyside: With pet scaling I'm a little worried about Soul Link Felguard @Hydramist
[6:08:20] Kyfoon: will be 50 or 60
[6:08:21] Noitheknight333: I feel like these numbers may be changed
[6:08:28] anomyouswhale: !runes
[6:08:38] lz_vie: they needed to buff pallies but it looks overtuned
[6:08:48] realScreaMy: frost mage will be hell of the fun :D
[6:09:02] JavaSkrpt: UA in the game RIP
[6:09:09] ama__deus: They did also warn that not all of those runes even make it into the game
[6:09:11] stilfor: mages had burnout which was 15% in p1
[6:09:21] gegonn1991: Is this for Phase 2 only?
[6:09:27] Kavsen: still feel shaman got shit KEKW

[6:09:42] screwu666: yes
[6:09:43] Sinostra: UA might not be such a big deal
[6:09:43] guidelock: adding the barrage to the oneshot combo EZ
[6:09:47] realScreaMy: mage will destroy the meta
[6:09:49] fiskensfriend: @jooperus ???
[6:09:51] varatupaj: whats so scary about ua? its another dot, you just cant spam dispels
[6:09:58] bisonkron: @Kavsen ya. shamans got hosed
[6:10:01] lz_vie: yeah UA is huge.
[6:10:03] Kroovy: One big question I have about Summon Felguard: it specifically says the Felguard benefits from all talents and abilities that affect other Warlock minions. So would the Felguard benefit from EVERY passive effect of Master Demonologist?
[6:10:05] ama__deus: Better stock up on mats LUL
[6:10:10] anomyouswhale: MAGE BOOTS SLOT 50% crit wtf
[6:10:12] stilfor: ashenvale about to start if you care

[6:13:37] lz_vie: plus that rune that gives 50% regen
[6:13:39] Cupz21: Sucks, Moonkin issue really is not mana in PvE. Just dmg
[6:13:39] Kyfoon: leather price going to go mad now KEKW
[6:13:45] JavaSkrpt: That's actually nice.
[6:13:52] ama__deus: -100% for 20s, -50% for 12s? HUH

[6:14:04] murxll99: priests unkillable unoomable
[6:14:05] guidelock: does that mean my mana surge only uses 50% monkaHmm
[6:14:06] Retsubabe: manacost reduction actually makes you regen less since you cast
[6:14:07] guidelock: new tech
[6:14:10] Kroovy: The cloth one doesn't inflict damage on yourself to wear, though. That's MUCH more useful for pvp
[6:14:22] sanzador: @ama__deus ifu spam abilities for the -50% mana cost you probgably get more value of it
[6:14:23] o0darling0o: oomkin
[6:14:23] gegonn1991: As a Balance Druid I also have Tailoring hehe
[6:14:28] Gunnan22: Its missing the plus dmg part on the cloth item that was shown in the preview
[6:14:29] poiskd: @guidelock lmao it still uses all your mana but double damage, would be sick
[6:14:40] basydb: so feral opens with helm, crowd pummeler and windfury
[6:14:42] ama__deus: Not shabby at all, really
[6:14:44] guidelock: BRO If its double dmg

[6:15:20] ama__deus: 1014 starting
[6:15:21] poiskd: itd be a funny interaction, costs 50% less mana but still uses all your mana so does double per point of mana spent. no idea if itll work like that or not
[6:15:24] Kroovy: Arcane mages wilding out on the opener of the fight. Arcane Power plus Monocle active
[6:15:34] ama__deus: that's with not a lot of mp5/spirit, though, yeah
[6:15:35] guidelock: @poiskd we pray code is shit
[6:15:45] NappyPOG: on level 40 you'll regen more mana than in ur test now
[6:16:06] gegonn1991: Crazy that everything is for P2
[6:16:09] Hanleyy: i think disc still gonna be awesome

[7:07:31] shinas: Channel?

[7:14:11] GamerGierr: costs mana to switch forms
[7:14:31] andorandor: 10% cap per tick

[7:34:20] prodigy_wow: Look at the stats and set bonus on the Irradiated set. Its actually a PVE set and they made a seperate PVP set
[7:34:28] Fakedtv: guess cloth is forced into tailor then, since the helm from tailor is isnane
[7:34:45] Sinostra: there doesn't seem to be an upgrade to the boots
[7:34:48] prodigy_wow: Hyperconductive is PVP, irradiated is PVE
[7:34:50] nobleguyyy: someone share proffessions ?
[7:34:51] ama__deus: Tailoring/Engi still looks like the play unless you only PVE
[7:35:01] prodigy_wow: -5 stam for 2 peice bonus lol
[7:35:07] bomzzwtf: Engi gets no goggles fuck off blizzard
[7:35:19] Sheepmaker: I saw there are some new cloth boots with 1% hit so why would you run tailoriong boots?
[7:35:36] Shangelton: !runes
[7:35:36] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8

[7:36:10] moarpwp: @Hydramist are you gonna update  your tier list with this information
[7:36:15] Fakedtv: kinda hope they jsut make the tailor boots ineffective above lvl 25 tbh

[7:38:08] Kroovy: The amount of hit on gear leads me to suspect that bosses may start to be 3 levels over level cap again
[7:38:19] sanzador: stealth + 1 Susge
[7:38:30] EpShade: imagine going from lvl 17 WC legs to those pants lol

[7:42:41] Kroovy: It's showing that Mind Spike is a 1.5 second cast. That's ridiculous if that's true

[7:43:16] o0darling0o: @broofenix feral
[7:43:24] Kroovy: Mind Spike and Mind Blast are not agnostic from one another. Quite the opposite; they're synergistic
[7:43:36] Pottustv: @Hydramist Do you know how much honor you need to go from rank 0 to 3?
[7:43:48] Rebukenx: are 5 man stealth death squads going to be biz for the pvp event?

[7:45:59] o0darling0o: @prodigypt do you powershift
[7:46:04] prodigypt: and energy regen will still be shit, altho tigers fury helps a bit
[7:46:06] Temmy5: can you link this site?
[7:46:20] thesunnyside: Crowd pummeler for 50% attack speed too
[7:46:29] prodigypt: if u powershift in pvp u are oom in 2 casts :D
[7:46:40] powerlinepreston: how does boomy look?
[7:46:42] prodigypt: with pummeler i can see it, but eh
[7:46:43] nobleguyyy: @hydramist mage or rogue ? which looks better ?
[7:47:00] the_moist_factory: Warlocks are about to fall off
[7:47:02] o0darling0o: @prodigypt innvervate then
[7:47:04] prodigypt: yeah @Hydramist i was awnsering to above :)
[7:47:11] physicx_x: Not all runes are confirmed correct?
[7:47:12] o0darling0o: innervate
[7:47:16] tommmy85: not imp VT?
[7:47:19] Sinostra: i play both lock and feral, gonna have a good time !
[7:47:20] thesunnyside: warlock with seduce could be scary
[7:47:32] perseay797: Is shadow word pain not worth its talents?
[7:47:52] JNOFI: What do you think about hunter? I think Trap Launcher will be strong.
[7:48:05] o0darling0o: meele hunter will kick
[7:48:05] theazg: rogues and hunter have no bracers runes, it's not completed
[7:48:06] Sinostra: much love bro xD
[7:48:09] NeVolent: UA HYPE!
[7:48:14] gioufis: what about boomies
[7:48:31] ch0wder92: caster phase
[7:48:38] Kyfoon: got boomie and shaman at 25, idk what to level first KEKW
[7:48:39] oldirtybrucie: and boomie form

[7:48:50] lastad94: will u make updates tier list ?
[7:48:50] masterbear1: toughts on mages?
[7:49:00] perseay797: Unstable affliction, pandemic for affliction locks..
[7:49:01] thesunnyside: is it confirmed the stun talent works with starsurge?
[7:49:08] steadyvince: what about pve? who will be s-tier you think?
[7:49:09] TheWouze: I wonder how the cloth helm will work with arcane surge
[7:49:28] TheWouze: Tailoring
[7:49:30] bomzzwtf: Why do most hunters go mm now
[7:49:35] theazg: @Hydramist rogues and hunter have no bracers runes, so it will be more for this two, or less for everyone else
[7:49:35] bomzzwtf: thought pets were rap
[7:49:36] khourdrick: I'm trying hard to decide between ele shammy and resto shammy with spiritual guidance. Resto seem's almost as equal when it come's to pvp next to ele since you can use similar runes. What are your thoughts?
[7:49:53] v3lik: what about engi belt?
[7:50:02] lastad94: head too
[7:50:30] lastad94: another tier list ?
[7:50:46] moarpwp: no tier list update first
[7:50:47] lastad94: yesss pls

[7:51:36] lastad94: just tell us the S tier lol
[7:52:07] theazg: preg inc to classic Kappa
[7:52:13] theazg: here we go again
[7:52:26] o0darling0o: shokadin^^
[7:52:26] ace52: what about hunter ?
[7:52:54] bolleboris1: sp?
[7:54:02] cockjab: aggrend said these runes might not all be in and the values are ofc subject to change so who knows
[7:54:26] darkh0rst: if sp can use penance in form it will be s tier
[7:54:54] gitzw: holy priest not worth talking about?
[7:55:02] JNOFI: Trap Launcher will create interesting interactions where NELF hunters use feign death, then eat/drink midfight with shadowmeld
[7:55:03] cockjab: @wrong_pride its considered holy power so prob not
[7:55:50] lastad94: so what rune slots do we get in p2 ?
[7:55:57] bomzzwtf: @Hydramist can you link the site you are on now?
[7:56:04] Sinostra: honestly, i'm wondering if we'll get all those rune slots in P2
[7:56:11] Sinostra: it would be 4 new slots
[7:56:13] darkh0rst: @cockjab but they said the runes are an exception
[7:56:25] Mistolin_: only belt and boots for phase 2
[7:56:33] Sinostra: how are we sure ?
[7:56:43] Nhpriest: !runes
[7:56:43] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8

[7:56:48] Sinostra: but more could be ecoming
[7:57:00] alexander_yudin: mages going to be so much fun !
[7:57:32] moarpwp: omg arent we gonna get unstable and felguard this phase ????
[7:57:40] Mistolin_: @Sinostra They said it when they announced SoD, also paladins get a bracer rune for an ability they get at lvl 44
[7:58:09] Sinostra: @Mistolin_ oh, ok
[7:58:14] Skipiz852: for bgs do you run stam gear or mana sustain ?
[7:58:14] theazg: @Hydramist where is rogues CoS? Every one got tons of cast shit and dots and no cos for rogues
