[0:25:11] guldurkhand2: If you want to become a millionaire, live like a millionaire. Millionaires spent very small percentage of their money every month, but because they get so much money, the small percentage still results in an expensive house and expensive car etc. So if you have low income, save as much as you can and put it investments, that way the percentage between your income and spending slowly grows. After several years you will be a millionaire and can increase your spending. Stop buying those clothes!

[5:26:16] warbringer159: the servers are the same capacity as retail
[5:26:27] gutzwow: increase server size, im a database engineer, its very easy just costs more money
[5:26:31] aidmann: if they allow free transfers back after the game dies down then thats a good fix
[5:26:32] spacemarine55: just open trasnfers to a NEW pvp server problem solved
[5:26:37] BoricuaSJ: there is always a tech solutions.. just means they need to INVEST more money to that.. so it is not beneficial to their budget line
[5:26:54] kirby0021: transfer to a mega server then cry about it being full... someone post the meme of sticking a stick in the bike then crying about it

[5:27:15] MintyLinkz: Asmon had a good idea, it was have like 5 Benedictions so B1, B2, B3 etc and have them all connected like trading, the auction house etc.
[5:27:21] mastermindx421: win trade? or no point, just collecting tokens? i forget
[5:28:31] tutubela: @OfficiallyLinkz That makes too much sense, sorry dude, no chance of that getting implemented LUL
[5:28:31] appleslices19: I mean.. Close to 80k have already free transferred to my server. The numbers aren't a lie.
[5:28:32] Teagens: @TwistedAshEUW Swifty and I have been friends for 9 Years. I've been at his side as a friend during the best of times and worse. Sasha, his wife, has become a dear friend of mine as well and she knows I would never disrespect her relationship with him, nor do I have an interest in a relationship with him. If someone tells you you cant be friends with a girl because you are in a relationship with a woman, you might want to rethink that relationship, because that's pretty controlling and toxic beh
[5:28:45] TheEndIsNear777: Servers can't handle that many People it would constantly crash since they from mid 2000's if they just increase layers since the capacity would be at maximum. What they need to do is buy/make 2022 servers that can handle 100 vs 100 and not crash. They should of done this years ago since they knew classic release was huge
