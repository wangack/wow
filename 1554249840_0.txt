[0:55:06] 인터넷포트: I think they sell most of them on AMazon so amazon figured it would be good for sales long term
[0:55:36] haneything: right next to you in game lol
[0:55:44] haneything: but yeah they are gonna be able to see your house layout
[0:55:58] jarvii_: maybe to use patents and make cheaper versions
[0:56:01] TheEndIsNear777: A superbot
[0:56:15] 7thSaga: you know WaffleBot? @Swifty  from harold and kumar LUL

[0:56:32] TheEndIsNear777: will amazon still sell gaming pcs >:)
[0:56:45] haneything: nah not gonna make cheaper versions
[0:56:49] billybaroo1: roombas are always the most expensive xmas gift on amazon every year lul
[0:56:51] 인터넷포트: thats not why they will continue using the existing ones that would destroy sales numbers
[0:57:15] haneything: they literally are buying it for the tech
[0:57:21] atomruns: I wonder if I can still make addons for WOW like with LUA scripting
[0:57:30] atomruns: I think that's how they all are made anyway
[0:57:31] TheEndIsNear777: as long as amazon still sells Pcs/Gaming stuff, sound cards/headphones :)
[0:57:32] atomruns: LUA
[0:57:33] jarvii_: amazons main goal is to have products in every market and use those products to get people into their ecosystem, main reason why all their stuff has alexa
[0:57:37] vikimek: We watch you from Russia with love Swifty
[0:57:45] munkeyondabs: also people put products on amazon websites that are counterfeit products, for example pet/dog accessories should always be bought by your vet instead of amazon since someone can provide counterfeit product and it could harm your pet since its from some random
[0:58:06] 인터넷포트: Its going to be the same thing the same vacuum just amazon making the $$$ they arent going to rebrand it lol
[0:58:09] atomruns: wow has no anticheat afaik
