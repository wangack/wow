[0:20:22] Flaverflaves: You'd spend way more on Thorium bars if you don't stick to the spurs. I think its a stack of bars just to do the quest for the thorium belt

[7:52:47] ryanc1124: I think WoW stays up forever tbh lol
[7:52:48] Atomblade: @swifty  wanna say thank you For all You did watching since the good old razer naga times ❤️

[7:54:01] headlocks000: @sam_felda it will be years before they take the servers down, people will still play, dont be so gloom and doom
[7:54:03] snappers321: I thought for a sec you had a mole on your forehead but it was just dirt on my monitor
[7:54:07] ryanc1124: the best part of retail at this point is the leveling, max level content sucks

[7:55:59] cicidarippa: @Bixster yeah like if you enjoy it have fun and if you don't move on, ppl so dramatic about everything
[7:56:07] pwnstarqt: Tower?
[7:56:23] Harthel: there are some really interesting wow private servers
[7:57:02] ryanc1124: honestly, the worst part about the way WoW has aged and now even newly released games is that people feel the need to bum rush all the content then complain that there is nothing to do
[7:57:42] ryanc1124: they will all sit there and do months worth of content in 3 weeks and then complain
[7:57:48] Harthel: well thats something they could plan for, right?
[7:58:04] jack75d: @NYYRyan24 or let their viewers farm all content for them
[7:58:05] Johnkw: hej john hope you had a wonderfull christmas.

[7:58:06] triumvirate0: what's the best way to play vanilla right now, season of mastery? are normal classic servers dead?
[7:58:11] Bixster: @Harthel
[7:58:36] ryanc1124: people don't like the time gating either so I mean idk what else they can do
[7:58:54] Bixster: @Harthel if they plan for it players call it timegating
[7:59:10] ryanc1124: they can't just push out an entire expansions content within a year

[11:05:07] MrDerpTV: @Swifty I remember all the stories, remember waiting for videos to launch, back then I was still a 16yo, just waiting for my hero to release a new video :D
[11:05:22] Seck_tor: because stormstrike hits with both weapons and both weapons can proc windfury at the same time
[11:05:36] Knullzey: Disarmed xD
[11:05:40] MaciekMacias: cause it has solid damage output, 2h shammy can oneshot someone in pvp but in pve it is a little bit worse
[11:05:42] Hamsterjan: Because 2 1 handers are way better DPS wise, but 2h hits harder / bigger crits and bigger WF
[11:05:45] Skycoh: 1h Shamans had more consistent DPS, because of the likelihood of proccing Windfury with 2-fast 1 handers.
[11:05:49] onepixelbeyond: So is Peanut gonna make an Apology Video when ya hit rank 15? He seems to talk alot of smack.
[11:05:53] Gizimoo86: @Seck_tor no dual wield in classic only tbc
[11:05:57] pwnstarqt: @seck_tor Yup Wreckage
[11:06:08] Skycoh: 2h Shamans were better for random burst.
[11:06:13] Seck_tor: @Gizimoo86  clearly you missed the convo ...
