Today, this burger was a sign of his failure. The double patties of meat reminded him not of succulent juicy beef but only the mighty veiny vascular muscles of Ameng. The seeded bread buns? It was Ameng’s cheeks as he squatted on Bumper’s face. The tomato? It was his blood dripping off Ameng’s hammer. The mayo? You know what it is

[5:53:48] OrganikCum: i said i play a boomy as alt, im just calling out a bad nerf and ur getting caught in your feelings
[5:53:52] BingoTingler: I play boomkin and starsurge needed nerfed.
[5:53:54] sergogg95: When Xaryu plays mage, everyone says that Mage is overpowered. When @Graycen plays mage, everyone says that other classes are overpowered for one sohtting him
[5:53:56] bassey_: star surge still feels good to use with the nerf
[5:53:59] Grabben33: BALANCED CoolCat

[5:55:34] mojanga: notmad ALERT
[5:55:37] AllieQuack: starsurge is literally doing LESS damage than phase 1 lmao
[5:55:37] oopsfish_: jackass
[5:55:39] sepph_: notmad ALERT monkaW
[5:55:39] Darksyde1029: @Egyptian_Joe Dude some stuff NEEDS to be nerfed because it's so out of line.
[5:55:40] Simply: notmad Looking nymnCorn
[5:55:43] Lifeles85: BOOMIES
[5:55:46] fossland: starsurge with more mana cost relative to dmg done
[5:55:48] keysersoze_taken: ye i saw someone compare the dmg of starsurge vs the arcane nuke mages has, and saying they were doing comparable dmg
[5:55:51] Fludens: it’s the graveyard
[5:55:51] 5L4Y3R: notmad ALERT
[5:55:51] DJspookyghost: DonkPls

[5:55:54] keysersoze_taken: 3 min cd
[5:55:54] oneALMONDMILKplease: gup getting pressed by one boomkin in chat, Sadge
[5:55:54] Egyptian_Joe: @Darksyde1029, yea i get that but all they are doing is nerfing the new flavor and not buffing any other classes
[5:55:56] keysersoze_taken: all mana
[5:55:56] Fludens: right corner
[5:56:14] Boodap1: gayge
[5:56:16] Grabben33: toxic streamer BabyRage
[5:56:18] Lifeles85: peepoHappy aw I hope they have a nice time
[5:56:19] dudeshamus: I wonder if Flop got any sleep yesterday lmao
[5:56:20] 5L4Y3R: peepoPopcorn notmad SmokeTime
[5:56:20] AlphaSimply: i fuck man?
[5:56:21] brownhammer112: wait its your gf bday and flop is offline?
[5:56:23] morpheusx34: doesn't starsurge hit harder than arcane surge, how does that makes sense
[5:56:23] Darksyde1029: @Egyptian_Joe Well everyone has strong shit so we shouldn't really be buffing anyone, we should tune down the overpowered ones
[5:56:28] AllieQuack: SS needed a nerf, but 50% was overkill
[5:56:35] DJspookyghost: Waiting when is the big dam
[5:56:37] BerkTheLUL: wasnt it 30%
[5:56:39] AlphaSimply: its 30%
[5:56:43] jungelregla: @Egyptian_Joe Have you been to STV? Why would they buff everything instead of tuning the ones that are insta cast oneshotting
[5:56:45] Boodap1: rogue need small buff or tuning to a few runes
[5:56:49] BerkTheLUL: 30% and buffs next sf for %66
[5:56:49] AlphaSimply: and it needed it, coming from a druid
[5:56:51] Egyptian_Joe: @Darksyde1029, starsurge definitely shouldve gotten nerfed. I mean hey im not the one who said "nobody is OP if everyone is OP" they did
[5:56:52] 5L4Y3R: it's 20% off scaling too I think
[5:56:54] hemsho: you critin 800 yourself lol
[5:56:54] stonerox: notmad ALERT
[5:56:57] ripinpeace10: wow frost mage does BIG DAM!
[5:56:57] voidzyxd: @Graycen wtf man you said you were going to solo it
[5:56:58] oneALMONDMILKplease: @Boodap1 ????
[5:57:00] OrganikCum: 35% with a spellpower coeff change, it's about a 40% nerf
[5:57:04] BerkTheLUL: they should increase sf range tho
[5:57:05] AllieQuack: they said 30% but actually did 35%, and nerfed the spellpower scaling from 100% to 41.5% which equals 50% overally damage nerf
[5:57:05] grethedren: graycen can mages still teleport to people in sleeping bags?
[5:57:06] ErobbIsWhite: shut up you mage bitch 4Weird
[5:57:07] Fludens: can’t one shot now, unplayable
[5:57:16] christiangodwarrior97: no bro on the dps meter im lower now so the game is unplayable
[5:57:19] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: what sucks is how every class has sustain, but warriors got a 3 min cd to heal for half a starsurge
[5:57:19] mcfly3000_: druids crymore
[5:57:22] fossland: boomkin gets nukes and rogues get throwing knife
[5:57:23] 5L4Y3R: yeah it's about half the damage not counting starfire
[5:57:29] Egyptian_Joe: @jungelregla, obviously starsurge shouldve got nerfed dingus
[5:57:29] 5L4Y3R: cause it's a different spell
[5:57:33] stonerox: oda WideRaveTime
[5:57:34] AlphaSimply: i just read the notes Dentge
[5:57:35] Blinkin: gn chat Bedge
[5:57:37] oneALMONDMILKplease: oda
[5:57:38] OrganikCum: it needed a nerf as i said, they made a bad nerf though
[5:57:39] boyjenus69: is the pvp event dead already, literally no one on my server is doing it rn
[5:57:40] BerkTheLUL: i hit 1300
[5:57:44] Lifeles85: @Blinkin Bedge /
[5:57:46] danteenus: like 1.3k
[5:57:55] verrack714: did druids get cyclone?
[5:57:56] Darksyde1029: @5L4Y3R Yea but you should be including starfire... because casters should have to cast to deal damage... and starfire can do big numbers now with the 66% buff
[5:57:57] BingoTingler: starfire also gets a cast speed increase when you go into eclipse form
[5:57:57] 5L4Y3R: KEKG
[5:57:58] AlphaSimply: at 25 my starfire is 3.5 sec cast pepeW
[5:57:59] danteenus: but it has a 10% crit chance and has a 3 sec cast time
[5:58:00] Iol69: doesnt eclipse lower cast time
[5:58:03] scaff_24: i hit a 1400 shadow word death
[5:58:04] BingoTingler: boomkin is fine
[5:58:04] oneALMONDMILKplease: OneGuy
[5:58:04] morpheusx34: starsurge should atleast need a proc or something to do the dmg it did pre nerf
[5:58:05] Iol69: or no
[5:58:07] whoopsiepoopsieman: yup
[5:58:07] Grabben33: It depends on ur HP
[5:58:08] cr1zpylol: mage will have no cooldown on blink next phase, also no gcd
[5:58:08] paulthecat: yes
[5:58:08] AllieQuack: starfire can hit 1300 if you crit, but crit chance is 5%
[5:58:10] DJspookyghost: moon2NOO sod boomkins when they have to cast
[5:58:29] resume___: starfire is huge mana sink
[5:58:31] 5L4Y3R: nah I need that mana for wild growth off cooldown
[5:58:32] keysersoze_taken: @ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney just get full plate bro and full bis, i could actually win vs prenerf boomies
[5:58:35] jungelregla: geared boomies are critting 1600+ with worldbuffs
[5:58:36] AllieQuack: starsurge got 30% crit chance buff, starfire has 5%, its not the same
[5:58:43] chard_GG: would be ok if eclipse actually stopped pushback
[5:58:48] AlphaSimply: Boomies mad seeing their mana go down, you can tell they didnt play classic boomy
[5:58:49] keysersoze_taken: @ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney fun part of warrior pvp is beating the odds LUL
[5:59:00] 5L4Y3R: @AlphaSimply kek
[5:59:01] mcfly3000_: crymore druids LUL
[5:59:04] Darksyde1029: @AllieQuack Yea it shouldn't be the same because it was fucking overpowered as shit lol
[5:59:10] 5L4Y3R: BabyRage fix it blizzard
[5:59:10] resume___: @AlphaSimply and thats the single reason i didnt play it in OG
[5:59:22] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: @keysersoze_taken good to hear
[5:59:24] AlphaSimply: oomkin name for a reason
[5:59:25] 5L4Y3R: I can't heal and tank and deal damage in one spec anymore! it's a huge nerf
[5:59:26] morpheusx34: warriors should get spell reflect
[5:59:31] Grabben33: But we draw the line when its more broken than mage CoolCat
[5:59:36] Iol69: it reminds me of home when everything feels somewhat broken
[5:59:40] resume___: now they do
[5:59:40] AlphaSimply: yeah its not even bad
[5:59:41] 5L4Y3R: ReallyMad
[5:59:43] AllieQuack: @Darksyde1029 nobody is saying it shouldnt have been nerfed, but 50% nerf was too much.
[5:59:44] danteenus: now we will becasue we are forced to use starfire
[5:59:45] oneALMONDMILKplease: oda
[5:59:45] 5L4Y3R: oomkin now
[5:59:49] 5L4Y3R: casting starfire
[5:59:55] 5L4Y3R: ye
[6:00:06] danteenus: we were already going oom in the raid prenerf
[6:00:17] Darksyde1029: @AllieQuack No it really wasn't. Instant cast spells should not be doing more than hard casted spells. That's literally the opposite of classic design. Casters should have to actually CAST to deal damage.
[6:00:19] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: 600?!
[6:00:23] cbusbb: what kind of jackass question was that
[6:00:24] AlphaSimply: feels bad, mana pots are going down now PEPW
[6:00:26] BerkTheLUL: smartest warlock player lule
[6:00:28] keysersoze_taken: ye but enemy faction can still kill u if they want @Graycen
[6:00:32] DJspookyghost: POGGIES frost is back baby
[6:00:34] Iol69: @danteenus how? your spells cost 0 and 6 mana
[6:00:35] 5L4Y3R: PEPW
[6:01:04] cbusbb: if your gonna quote me u need to say everything UltraMad
[6:01:06] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: so mage is only hitting for 200 shy of what druids hit for
[6:01:06] keysersoze_taken: its about getting the kill no??
[6:01:06] AllieQuack: @Darksyde1029 i'm sorry you got killed by a druid and got angry, but this was clearly too heavyhanded of a nerf
[6:01:07] danteenus: @Iol69 we use starfire and sunfire too in pve Dentge
[6:01:08] Fludens: I would head over there and help, but kind of too late now
[6:01:12] keysersoze_taken: dont think the tag helps
[6:01:13] resume___: @Iol69 sunfire and moonfire and starfire all eat the mana now
[6:01:14] AlphaSimply: 2 manning, bold move cotton
[6:01:22] Aarget: @scaredmoneywontmakemoney 200 is a huge amount lmao

[6:41:31] Jelerman: didnt you want to go some days ago to the barber
[6:41:35] kutebread: ZF won't be a raid.
[6:41:35] scaff_24: ST
[6:41:36] PlebTM_: Sunken
[6:41:36] oneALMONDMILKplease: @81unt o7
[6:41:39] Nathanew321: sunken temple probably

[6:41:43] Wildboomkin: >?
[6:41:44] kutebread: 50 raid is sunken temple
[6:41:46] Fludens: it’s probably ST
[6:41:48] Imperiuss108: mara
[6:41:52] Thedruidtyler: no chance they do st
[6:41:53] 5L4Y3R: lol
[6:41:55] MJ_z1: when are you going to level Spriest?
[6:41:56] kutebread: SM will be 60
[6:41:59] verrack714: i think ampy said it was probably gonna be mara
[6:42:03] nz_jade: SM raid be the final
[6:42:05] bonziatv: mara would be cool
[6:42:11] Tidal96: ST is the best one
[6:42:11] OlympicUSA: Its Karazhan Crypts
[6:42:13] nPayn: ZF makes he most sense
[6:42:13] bigsteve1015: they picked everyones least favorite dungeons and made raids out of them
[6:42:15] Kameari77: maraudon for sure
[6:42:16] AndroTTV: mara raid would also stop the mages from farming it
[6:42:19] morpheusx34: how about they do 2 10 man raids lazy fucks
[6:42:20] kutebread: Blizzard also confirmed that Naxx will be a 80 raid.

[6:42:42] Thedruidtyler: wrath of the lich king
[6:42:43] Razorback1111: zf raid with improved mara gear probably
[6:43:04] verrack714: i hope they dont make mara a raid, I want the princess dagger
[6:43:10] Kameari77: they always did the not so so popular ones
[6:43:22] whoopsiepoopsieman: They are going to have to buff the health of the 60 content right? Its gonna be too easy with these runes.
[6:43:23] oneALMONDMILKplease: Kara crypts at 60 HOLY
[6:43:23] AllieQuack: ZF would probably be most hype to me
[6:43:23] nz_jade: how about we just get ICC
[6:43:28] scaff_24: ST makes more sense imo
[6:43:30] tjzlock: blizzard always trying to stop the actual players from farming instead of banning bots
