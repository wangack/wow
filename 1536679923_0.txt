[1:30:35] wintersteppe: its 1 am here
[1:30:56] tutubela: The reason why I really like the Dragonflight talents so far, is that because you'll be able to have many of the talent combinations you were not able to have in the last like 10 years or so (if ever), shadow dance as outlaw rogue for one is gonna be crazy, also, having cold blod as outlaw? come on dude. And, you can mix and match to get these crazy combinations. I can't wait to get on it and test everything. And knowing you, you might love it, but not just with rogues, but with the other classe
