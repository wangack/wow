[0:10:56] Lusciousdan: Basically 20 minutes of him talking about all the things we DM'ed about for weeks LUL
[0:11:02] Lusciousdan: Well... not all the things zeegerHotdog zeegerHotdog zeegerHotdog
[0:11:54] Lusciousdan: So one of the settings Asus uses... "Default" actually means THEIR insane default of shunting all the power in the world... not the actual Intel default
[0:12:10] your_friend_tim: Dan, I'm going to ask you to calm down.
[0:12:17] your_friend_tim: @Spyke_ZGZ Can't do loud noises.
[0:12:24] SavedEight_ZGZ: anemia and some other things
[0:12:28] Spyke_ZGZ: ASUS swapped to cheaper, less efficient VRM and it shows.

[0:13:37] Spyke_ZGZ: "See our Default is better than theirs."
[0:14:22] your_friend_tim: NOPE
[0:14:23] Lusciousdan: jay was insistent that default has to mean intel defaults... let overclockers turn things on but having everything cook and throttle at default settings is so dumb
[0:14:23] your_friend_tim: CANT GET IN
[0:14:23] snipez_zgz: goal is lvl 100 today, someone come slap me and don't let me quit
[0:14:24] Spyke_ZGZ: Honestly, and this is definitely a dickbag statement, but the TechTubers kinda ruined the industry lmfao
[0:14:26] your_friend_tim: VERY UPSET
[0:14:42] Spyke_ZGZ: All the manufacturers just try to do stupid shit to be better than the other out of the box so Linus says they're good

[0:15:19] your_friend_tim: Do as I say not as I do
[0:15:20] Spyke_ZGZ: It isn't, it's on the companies for using it as a fucking crutch.
[0:15:21] WMAlleG: my monitor broke up today, and now im using a 43" tv as a main monitor. this is really a wild experience hahahaha
[0:15:24] Lusciousdan: Linus just wants products that don't break when he drops them
[0:15:38] SavedEight_ZGZ: @Lusciousdan loll
[0:15:52] SavedEight_ZGZ: dudes dropped SO much shit over the years, it actually hurts me
[0:16:00] Lusciousdan: LTT for actual product reviews... eh I'll stick to GamersNexus and those types
[0:16:05] Spyke_ZGZ: But even when I worked at VisionTek, we sent Jay a USB SSD and my manager made me cherry-pick the absolute best one we had.
[0:16:05] Lusciousdan: They do some fun things tho
[0:16:10] Spyke_ZGZ: 4 of them were just dead when I tried to test.

[0:18:08] SavedEight_ZGZ: honestly it was probably a headache lol
[0:18:10] Spyke_ZGZ: It's been 9 years since I worked that job. It's been 9 years since Jay built Skunkworks.

[0:35:08] your_friend_tim: Agreed, so stupid, and they catch fire so easy where they used to be
[0:35:12] Quelxaxas: as someone who has assembled BBQS for an appliance store, webers are by far my favourite. parts are great and easy to assemble. also you get an even cook
[0:35:33] SavedEight_ZGZ: i love my weber and my trager
[0:35:44] SavedEight_ZGZ: use the traeger more in recent years, but the weber is like, the OG.
[0:36:03] draegon_tengoku_zgz: I'm hungry been sitting in Buffalo wild wings parking lot undecided if I want to go in and eat or go somewhere else but either everything sounds good. I think I'm just glad to be out of the house
[0:36:05] Ghrimm: dabbling in a bunch of things is good, all the streamers ive watched who only play 1 thing get stale after a while. IMHO
[0:36:08] Quelxaxas: i bought my parents a weber and they love it, they grill in the middle of winter
[0:36:17] SavedEight_ZGZ: @draegon_tengoku_zgz Jack Daddy Burger
[0:36:25] SavedEight_ZGZ: dont look at the calories though
[0:36:29] SavedEight_ZGZ: like 1,300
[0:36:44] draegon_tengoku_zgz: Pfft calories are for vegans
[0:37:02] SavedEight_ZGZ: TWO LAMB PATTIES ARE STACKED WITH A BREADED CHICKEN FILLET, JALAPENO AND A BLEND OF CHEESES, WHILE CRISPY ONION RINGS AND OUR SOUTHWESTERN RANCH DRESSING ADD THE FINAL TOUCH TO THIS MOUTHWATERING BURGER. BURGERS ARE MADE TO ORDER AND SERVED ON A TOASTED BUN WITH FRENCH FRIES.
[0:37:08] SavedEight_ZGZ: okay that didnt show on website in caps, my bad lmao
[0:37:28] Quelxaxas: if you really want a quality grill, go with a green egg, but they are quite pricey. best bang for your buck is a weber, hands down
