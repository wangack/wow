[0:33:34] drewbullx: new pathing or no?
[0:33:50] drewbullx: neat
[0:34:42] Pooseboy: I love tower td, it’s the other game I played with my cs and d2 in Internet cafes. I played the Warcraft ones and StarCraft ones. loved seeing people get knocked out 1 at a time
[0:35:03] Ghrimm: lurker D was amazing
[0:35:21] Pooseboy: I rarely played the real game, all custom games back then
[0:35:27] drewbullx: CS D2 and Warcraft in internet cafe - sounds exactly like my youth :D FeelsGoodMan
[0:35:32] LumberChopMan: And are you still playing this on solo since they were having issues with latency on multiplayer?
[0:35:47] AmandaMarie_ZGZ: I have never been to an internet cafe lol
[0:35:56] ivanp88: this does seem very similar to d4 or is just me?
[0:36:20] drewbullx: @AmandaMarie_ZGZ you're missing out KEKLEO
[0:36:49] deadb0lt_: Pretty much stops at the same genre, though. This game is quite a bit different than D4
[0:36:57] Ghrimm: @ivanp88 its also similar to D2, D3 and path of exile
[0:37:08] drewbullx: A lot of people would say this is better than D4 EZ
[0:37:21] Pooseboy: I don’t think Internet cafes would be the same today, it’d be like going to a blockbuster today, which if there was a blockbuster left they would probably sell vegetables nowadays
[0:37:31] deadb0lt_: About the only thing Diablo 4 has on LE is visuals, cutscenes, and overall 'fluff' type stuff. Core gameplay-wise, LE is in a different world.
[0:37:37] Ghrimm: there is 1 still left in business Poose
[0:37:42] Ghrimm: its in Alaska
[0:38:07] drewbullx: what's a Blockbuster?

[0:38:39] Pooseboy: no one picking up the phone at the Internet cafe and disconnecting you
[0:38:58] LumberChopMan: Might jump on LE when that happens

[1:15:39] cajuncanuck: They evolve into legendaries
[1:15:43] cajuncanuck: randomly
[1:16:25] cajuncanuck: you wear they, and they add affixes

[1:16:32] StreamElements: Link to my YouTube Page, HIT THAT SUB BUTTON!! - https://www.youtube.com/c/ZeegersTV
[1:16:37] cajuncanuck: similar to how you add affixes by making a legendary
[1:17:23] mrresetxyz: probl is the base item not too much good, alot of other unique are better, if y need dmg reduction its ok
[1:17:23] cajuncanuck: and the number indicates how many tiers of affixes can be applied. So, 10 = 2 x T5, for an example
[1:17:59] cajuncanuck: that one specifically might not be good for you, but just saying how they work in general
[1:18:54] cajuncanuck: just wear them
[1:19:01] cajuncanuck: and with XP they just evolve
[1:19:06] aginsb: as you use it, it will randomly get more mods
[1:19:07] cajuncanuck: and add affixes
[1:19:12] aginsb: and deplete the weavers will
[1:19:52] cajuncanuck: So, let's say you had a 20 WW item. It could end up with 8! affixes, and maybe 4-5 T5+.
[1:20:09] cajuncanuck: which would be godly
[1:20:13] cajuncanuck: maybe
[1:20:21] cajuncanuck: again, total RNG
