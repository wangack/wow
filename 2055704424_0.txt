[0:18:22] Saltpaetr: I think the general playerbase mostly agrees on that order. Only thing different between me and your lists were that I put Urianger above Thancred

[0:19:36] Hunter_GS: @OniScythe there are plenty of stakes in the world of ff, theres no need to kill characters for that
[0:19:38] Nightshade1008: Yeah agreed
[0:19:42] Saltpaetr: If theyre unwilling to kill the remaining scions, they should be put to the back and introduce new main cast members for sure

[0:19:54] Vinestra28: @OniScythe Don't gotta kill people for stakes.
[0:19:54] Besserguy: i never saw ultima thule as a bait and switch, it was always about scions having absolute faith in the player for me
[0:19:55] Braggardt: I disagree with your opinions on Thancred in ShB, it would have been a great sendoff scene but faaaaar too early in the story. Push that back to 5.1 or 5.2 and it would have more weight
[0:20:01] trebolf: I don't even think it's plot armor. It's MMO armor
[0:20:09] Nimlex_: ultima thule was not a bait and switch, u really think they would start off killing someone offscreen
[0:20:12] Thefatkid145: he should have

[0:20:19] PenguInMug: NODDERS
[0:20:20] TheFuriyon: @Braggardt When he started to feel the drawbacks of the soul being away from the body for too long or?
[0:20:21] annapurna__: YEP
[0:20:24] ravenofjudgement: I was so surprized Thancred was still alive

[0:20:33] clannagh: Where can I see this video?
[0:20:36] DJDigiUK: anime plot armour AYAYA
[0:20:37] Philbobaggins12: Cheer100 Replace ALL of the scions with Elidibus, Hythlodaeus and Emet Selch,  I need my sassy boy back! Ascians did nothing wrong.
[0:20:37] Neroniss_: but then we wouldnt have "This is Thancred"
[0:20:38] Hunter_GS: yeah i dont agree, idk for me character death ads nothing
[0:20:40] Tilendra: I dont think UT was ever about them dying
[0:20:44] trebolf: He should've died. They painted that picture and then suddenly he's back lol
[0:20:49] Phabey: @clannagh the daily preach on YT
[0:20:53] OniScythe: People really thought people died in ultima thule?  Of they ever do kill someone it will be a bit more grandiose than that i think
[0:20:56] KaiZen2048: It would have been a beutiful poetic end
[0:20:59] Zyklon86: PLS MORE OVERLAPPING TALKING
[0:21:02] yuiona: Thancred let her go but also supported her on her self discovery journey
[0:21:02] nohomu67: PepeLaugh We needed a tank for duty support
[0:21:11] trebolf: @Philbobaggins12 Unpopular opinion: Emet Selch is too fan service-y now. Let the man die in peace.
[0:21:12] EeraGames: I think the thing is the Scions all represent "someone" to the players, the twins are the little brother/sister or children. Thancred is the father figure.

[0:21:49] spicyfishalmond: thoughts on ff7 rebirth feature reveals?
[0:21:53] Bisquetz: eh, thancred living in shb is fine.
[0:21:58] Vinestra28: @Miss_Kas Bg3 did establish this PepeLaugh
[0:22:00] darkain89: @Preachlfw  have you checked out the new PS5 state of play with FF7 rebirth new gameplay vid and features etc? (sorry if it was asked again but did not see)
[0:22:02] Braggardt: I would see Thancred's death in 5.1 or 5.2, for the same cause, but with the added weight of Krile not knowing and keeping his body alive on the Source
[0:22:05] Warden120: @spicyfishalmond He hasn't seen it and probably wont
[0:22:08] Hunter_GS: okey so 1 minute of emotional breakdown or years of having them around. idk i wouldnt take the deal
[0:22:09] LeoricDidNothingWrong: who is the dead dude behind you
[0:22:13] Miss_Kas: @Miss_Kas Despairge
[0:22:14] trebolf: It was a great sendoff story wise AND gameplay wise.
[0:22:18] Vinestra28: @darkain89 he aint watching anything
[0:22:18] Zziggz: Thancred didn't deserve to die, now Tataru yes
[0:22:26] 3rayed: @LeoricDidNothingWrong The Emperor of Man
[0:22:28] trebolf: It was a great sendoff story wise AND gameplay wise. His arc was pretty much done anyway.
[0:22:37] SpiderXIV: no way home @Preachlfw ?
[0:22:41] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw My opinion is 100% honest AND an absolute cop-out, I'd be okay with "both" possibilities, either doing something darker/more serious, like you two discussed, and I'd also be okay if we went along our merry way as we did so far. As long as it is told as well as everything so far, I'm okay and I will bawl like an absolute bitch.
[0:22:45] Boxer502: Ye-yeah, very good point
[0:22:46] Droweina: is it similar to the Aurene case?
[0:22:46] Vinestra28: @Preachlfw tbf gwen stacey got fucked by gravity working NODDERS
[0:22:48] rymed: @Hunter_GS I mean, I look at Haurchefant. A minor character and people still obsess over him
[0:22:49] Mutes_: Preach can you do more games like yesterday, that was hilarious
[0:23:00] KhalBones: Yeah we are
[0:23:02] SpiderXIV: Andrew Garfield is great

[0:23:05] Mutes_: well, "will you do" is a better way to word that
[0:23:06] zattania_fey: @preachlfw Mike, can you give a prediction for the WoL moving forward?
[0:23:10] Zziggz: oh who was the murderer yesterday?
[0:23:18] Vinestra28: @Zziggz Rebecca the pub owner
[0:23:22] KhalBones: Andrew Garfield will play Spiderman again
[0:23:23] Umseslad: @Zziggz The bike
[0:23:35] Besserguy: i never saw ultima thule as a bait and switch, it was always about scions having absolute faith in the player for me, never believed they would stay dead for a second @Preachlfw
[0:23:39] world_tree3: PepeLaugh surely disney would not milk it even harder
[0:23:51] yuiona: Estinien is just there KEKW
[0:23:55] EeraGames: The WoL will continue to be alive NODDERS
[0:24:00] KaiZen2048: Garfield was a great spider man, crap Peter Parker though
[0:24:05] Chewmii: Same
[0:24:10] Dragonnan_Drakelos: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say, I'm kind of a cop-out fan, as long as it's told good, I'd be okay with both getting new or sticking with the old. Hell, I'd be even up for a mix of the two.
[0:24:12] Lissariel: @Besserguy same
[0:24:13] ployboi69: Solution 69 Kreygasm
[0:24:19] trebolf: @KaiZen2048 The opposite for Tobey lol

[0:24:28] Ractorious: what is solution 9?
[0:24:33] riotscream: old lurker here @Preachlfw u playing sod p2?
[0:24:35] Vaylufa: HUHH
[0:24:40] KaiZen2048: @trebolf True!
[0:24:41] Sneko13: I have a feeling Estinien will end up supporting a team once he gets there
[0:24:45] Teh_Gaffer: Even if they were open to killing off scions, Dawntrail is absolutely NOT the time to do it if they survived through Shadowbringers and Endwalker.
[0:24:48] Hick12: The WoL will start inspecting things beneath the floors.
[0:24:49] OniScythe: I am cautiously optimistic for the msq but I am nervous tbh
[0:24:49] OzMagi: S9 is such an obvious red gerring its insane
[0:24:52] ravenoushydra: he really hasn't though?

[0:25:03] Hakizu: simp
[0:25:04] PenguInMug: KEKYou "badass fighter doesn't know how to do anything else"
[0:25:04] Brandilath: Estinien is kind of just a dude now.
[0:25:04] KaiZen2048: OMG that notif KEKW
[0:25:05] Chirriu: Chirriu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 83 months! 83 is such a boring number. Cant even think of something witty to put here. Maybe I could load an earlier save file for 69. Just need to scroll up for that.
[0:25:08] TheFuriyon: In hindsight, I really hoped they would've kept Solution 9 a secret so the surprise moment would've been way more effective, speaking of keeping things secret, did you see the new wow post? @Preachlfw
[0:25:09] Mitune: I mean where does he have to go for character development at this point? @preachlfw
[0:25:09] SpiderXIV: if you ask Jordan estinien is the main character KEKW
[0:25:10] BigMightyena: NODDERS
[0:25:11] Devomatics: Estinien has his moments though so I wouldnt really call him that
[0:25:14] ICantFindSock: I dont think he is just comic relief, I think he is a pillar
[0:25:15] 0acht: I think their fear Estinien played straight would overshadow the WoL :)
[0:25:17] yuiona: the gap moe is too strong with estinien KEKW
[0:25:17] Saltpaetr: Its not filler and I'm sure we will appreciate it more in 7.x or 8.x but it is disappointing that we are almost at the exact same time storywise at end of 6.0 and 6.5
[0:25:22] Braggardt: I don't personally want the scions to die, but I DO want us to spend time with other people (yes, hoary boulder WIDEGIGACHAD )
[0:25:28] Mkenzie: Sorry if i missed it, will we be wacthing the Sony State of play for FF7rb?
[0:25:31] Teh_Gaffer: He's not really, he had one joke in thavnair and otherwise is treated as the straight man in funny situations
[0:25:31] nohomu67: Sure
[0:25:31] BigMightyena: KEKW
[0:25:33] Decadence001: @preachlfw the thirst crew will disagree I feel
[0:25:41] DespairInShadows: make them all evil NODDERS
[0:25:45] one_mae_bee: truetrue
[0:25:45] KaiZen2048: Im ok with that but they should use it less than every other cutscene for him
[0:25:47] ravenofjudgement: @Braggardt Concern how about new Hrithgal ?
[0:25:47] Atticon: I think Urianger and Thancred will be the comical duo in DT.
[0:25:48] Mitune: I truly believe estinein has any place to go
[0:25:51] sstarfall_: if a character is done developing, get rid of them Shruge
[0:25:53] Lissariel: I love Estinien, I like that he's loosened up a bit from his early days
[0:25:54] Mitune: No place
[0:26:02] trebolf: @Mkenzie Nah he's avoiding it because FF7R2 is a for sure play anyway

[0:27:04] EeraGames: I think I'm going to miss out on Dawntrail at the moment. Not sure I'm going to vibe with the new story arc and after 10 years of story I'd rather keep FF14 wrapped up in my head for now.
[0:27:05] Khymori: Nearly as many secret siblings as Fast and Furious movies.

[0:27:13] Supersenkel: @Preachlfw did you know Pint made a video about Eureka?
[0:27:13] 0acht: for certain amounts of "did"

[0:27:40] yuiona: What a pathetic bitch KEKW
[0:27:40] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw Eureka has (some kind of) resolution to the grandpapy thing for Krile, don't it? Or were you specifically talking about a payoff to the letter itself? 'Cause you mentioned that too.
[0:27:43] Vinestra28: NOTED Mike has retired and become a boomer. Pint is the new hardcore gamer.
[0:27:43] KaiZen2048: KEKW

[0:29:14] Vinestra28: @Preachlfw But.. we're getting space travel in Dawntrail HmmCult

[0:43:45] arobba: datamining sucks man
[0:43:51] yuiona: they have to introduce a live update system. When someone triggers something (like getting to a new boss) then the content is released and will be downloaded by everyone in the background. That could prevent datamining
[0:43:55] OspreyRed: @KelticNight you instantly dismiss and laugh at everything they do and say
[0:43:55] Geri_0123: encrypted data is a good idea

[0:44:15] TomTomfoolery: how does FF manage data mining?
[0:44:15] HolgerDK: That means no actual testing on the PTR => horribly bugged patch
[0:44:15] Lithirrdys: if this turns out shit it's Mike fault NODDERS
[0:44:16] Holliday1217: have they tried asking the people doing it to stop PepeLaugh
[0:44:17] FafferUK: they can't just keep data on private servers until it's released?

[0:49:56] nohomu67: Pog Season of Wonderment
[0:49:57] Farthers: Is it practice for World Soul saga so the story isnt instantly data mined on release
[0:49:57] DespairInShadows: just wait for the wowhead article PepeLaugh

[0:50:36] Geri_0123: @Mattysaiyan would be possible to only decrypt stuff as event triggers happen, idk if wow's infrastructure would support that
[0:50:37] DeadContext: Do they have the tech to stop dataminers though?
[0:50:41] pupkat: @Preachlfw you building this up too much
[0:50:46] ColdIceCreamMan: @DeadContext yes
[0:50:46] palecarnage: like in FF14 OG
[0:50:47] Derthon: EU players have to basicly hide from internet to avoid spoilers due to staggered launch
[0:50:53] Shelana95: They are making changes, they are affecting us !  Pog ! Huge
[0:51:06] YzieGG: they put fake runes in tho
[0:51:10] ployboi69: NO
[0:51:11] shinra40: no
[0:51:11] Shelana95: I think it is a Datamine test
[0:51:11] Edrem: FF14 has encrypted data that isn't decrypted until people load into Savage, it's a somewhat solution
[0:51:12] tecnicallynot: no
[0:51:12] Vitriol17: I loved during heavensward where the void ark could be seen flying around the sea of clouds long before we knew what it was

[0:51:23] stopher121: The community should shun the Dataminers
[0:51:23] KaiZen2048: test of reflexes?
[0:51:23] KelticNight: would be nice if the dataminers just chilled for 5 minutes LUL
[0:51:24] daris888: put in fakes into so that ppl not knowing what is real?
[0:51:27] AlbieCookie: Not unless it's a minor change
[0:51:28] OspreyRed: SoD rune locations were not found by dataminers in phase 1
[0:51:31] ColdIceCreamMan: please give us global release also. I don't wanna live under a rock for a day&night because US solves everything before we even go live
[0:51:34] Mordy_the_Mighty: @Geri_0123 a decrypt key is a very small amount of info to pass from server to clients, the client will do most of the work in local anyway so it shouldn't be imposible (basically Steam preload tech)
[0:51:35] crashuloxd: Fake descriptions?
[0:51:38] SpiderXIV: how does squeenix deal with dataminers for 14?
[0:51:41] shinra40: its still hinted at
[0:51:44] Bisquetz: just cut the top half of every model in the game NODDERS
[0:51:50] cannedexpectations: microsoft blizzard has chapgpt4 now, and gpt5 is coming out  this year.... so maybe they are testing encryption AI
[0:51:55] spudmorph: but they can analyze sizes etc and theorize
[0:52:00] Anganthyr: @OspreyRed was not needed though ... there was a guide like on day one
[0:52:03] Dernsby: Supposedly some of the more well known dataminers are deciding not to datamine 10.2.6 in accordance with Blizz wishes
[0:52:09] OzMagi: full suite of lawers and cease and desist only orks with dataminers
[0:52:13] tecnicallynot: they can patch only when its relevant/acessible i guess Shruge
[0:52:17] shinra40: @SpiderXIV they dont its a show but dont tell scenario and ppl in 14 avoid data mining things
[0:52:18] zyroth_o7: @SpiderXIV i think people still datamine, just dont make it public
[0:52:18] ployboi69: NO
[0:52:19] yuiona: @SpiderXIV they just dont do PTR so the earliest dataminers can work with is release date
[0:52:27] YzieGG: no PTR is a win
[0:52:27] kurki666: why we have bin cam'
[0:52:28] urbish_: @dernsby Sure
[0:52:33] OspreyRed: @Anganthyr not everything was, some runes took days to find and there was a lot of community discussion in discord to figure out the hints
[0:52:37] glenngf: if they had high quality QA they wouldnt need PTR
[0:52:37] alpaca_god_7000: They just need to drop the patch when the servers go down and let people datamine but with 8 hours left to go it will be too much for people to care
[0:52:49] Kattsallad: Can we remove Mike cam and just have the bin cam?
[0:52:50] riotscream: still is
[0:52:53] KelticNight: i'd take a buggy launch over PTR. less people know the bewtter
[0:52:55] riotscream: worst leggo
[0:53:04] Geri_0123: hope this will be global release, as EU will be fucked with a day delay here
[0:53:15] Tibbroar: @zyroth_o7 it goes public but in general people avoid it because of potential spoilers
[0:53:19] Hupu_a: over hype is always bad Sadge
[0:53:23] yuiona: What if they trigger a live update once they reach a certain boss or something. So you basically download the boss data once you get there @Preachlfw
[0:53:32] spudmorph: keep expectations low and you can't be disappointed NODDERS
[0:53:34] shinra40: the funny thing is wow works with wowhead thats its biggest data miner
[0:53:36] EeraGames: That's on Blizzard though tbh, they've left it unknown and hyped it up with NO limitation or expectation setting
[0:53:37] DespairInShadows: like gilneas Sadge

[0:59:32] lozbozuk: You don’t need to buy DF to access capital cities. it’ll just happen in those instead?

[1:03:01] Indigo___1: don’t say that name
[1:03:03] Boxer502: Hearthstone does a lot of this too, mucking with timelines, that'd be a fun thing to see them spin off of. @Preachlfw

[1:03:23] VallanceHeals: CHRIS
[1:03:28] Mak2349: if it's beta timeline Thorghgast then yes plz
[1:03:31] Geri_0123: that sounds cool
[1:03:34] chomicze89: what if it's thorgagagoost, normal thorgast but with gagagoo playing non stop
[1:03:39] dragothicx: bringing up torghast to current level cap with new rewards would be nice Pog Torghast had potential and it's now completely forgotten Sadge
[1:03:40] Nobbel87: you mean the original concept of the tower of torghast? fight baddies that are dead?
[1:03:43] Phabey: Torghast *should* be evergreen content if they didn't purposefully ruin it from its alpha version Sadge
[1:03:48] TheFuriyon: They did do that sort of with the anniversary event where we went back and fought 3 bosses back to back to back @Preachlfw
[1:03:48] cannedexpectations: DSR
[1:03:53] Plinglebob: DSR?
[1:03:54] truezarosian: DSR is such an amazing ultimate <3
[1:03:55] ployboi69: Lich king reprise Kreygasm
[1:03:56] DaftiDuck_: should watch Rinon's DSR video at some point, its great

[1:04:03] Chewmii: Eeeeee Despairge
[1:04:04] insomnomicon: whats the game for today?
[1:04:05] Decadence001: Calling it - it's a scenario type event based on WC3 where they retcon the Jailer in @Preachlfw KEKW
[1:04:05] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw If you could bring over 1 boss from one game to the other for a limited time event fight (FFXIV - WoW), which one would you choose? Could be dungeon boss, raid boss, world boss, whatever. 󠀀
[1:04:05] ravenoushydra: torghast was so fun I hope you have to do mega torghast to play the new expansion and each individual floor takes three times as long as the original
[1:04:09] 3rayed: Despairge
[1:04:13] Service_charge: save him Smadge
[1:04:16] Kage_Jittai: Because the writers ruining modern WoW isn't enough?

[1:04:21] Geri_0123: Thrall doesn't cross the sea
[1:04:26] Mak2349: a realyyyyyy fuvking hard fight

[1:04:29] EeraGames: @Service_charge let him die GIGACHAD
[1:04:29] Goregie: it got jeathe to play the story
[1:04:30] yuiona: The best Boss experience i ever had
[1:04:33] VallanceHeals: @Preachlfw Do you think they're going to have a time limited period where Dragonflight is insanely cheap to pick up, so you can access all of the content before it and including it, and then this new patch involves every continent? COPIUM
[1:04:33] freakinsnusk: @ravenoushydra and you need to do it 3 times a week instead of two, that would be dope
[1:04:34] cannedexpectations: because of Haurchfant!!
[1:04:34] dwolf010: Holly Twitter (replies tab) is full of pirate flags. So I think it has to do something with pirates
[1:04:35] VipMalis: didnt wow had whole expansion about it
[1:04:44] MrSpaceGrape: Blizzard doesnt have the mind to do anything like that.
[1:04:49] Zirconix: CoT/WoD was along those lines i guess
[1:04:52] Farthers: What if Shadowlands wasnt dogshit
[1:04:59] unseenself: Tbh most ultimates are what if scenarios where villains get to their ultimate form
[1:05:00] LordRavenspire: @VallanceHeals atm you but TWW and you get DF, so that's the "cheap" version
[1:05:03] LordRavenspire: *buy#
[1:05:06] Nobbel87: they did it in dragonflight leveling, murloc world
[1:05:07] truezarosian: @Farthers gotta be somewhat believable :D
[1:05:08] shinra40: why was dragon soul even in canverns of time

[1:05:13] huntaoce: KEKW
[1:05:14] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw If you could bring over 1 boss from one game to the other for a limited time event fight (FFXIV - WoW), which one would you choose? Could be dungeon boss, raid boss, world boss, whatever.

[1:05:46] EazzyBreezzy: All of WoW was a dream and we go back to classic and the world is at peace lol
[1:05:47] Braggardt: nah, shadowlands should have just never happened
[1:05:47] Thelete: shadowlands but without the jailor
[1:05:50] ravenoushydra: yeah dude they're making a whole new expansion for the 10.2.6
[1:05:51] TheFuriyon: "What if Shadowlands was released with all the features from the final patch?" @Preachlfw
[1:05:51] VallanceHeals: You could.... Just play the game, without being hated by the game? :O
[1:05:57] cannedexpectations: lol!
[1:05:58] Mak2349: Now you're going down a rabbit hole KEKW

[1:06:06] ployboi69: Jailer Nipple Kappa
[1:06:09] Edrem: Sylvanas cracks the helm and it just opens a portal to a shard instead NODDERS

[1:06:33] aftergl0w: KEKW
[1:06:38] Traion: Cheer100 I figured it out: The Event is MEGA Thorgast. 100 floors, all powers are just 1% stat increases. If you don't complete at least one run your char gets deleted. At the end of the even the real trailer for the next expac drops: Shadowlands 2: Maw Harder!
[1:06:38] 3rayed: KEKW
[1:06:39] ployboi69: KEKW
[1:06:39] annapurna__: BatChest

[1:06:44] Teh_Gaffer: "What is the Jailer wasn't in Shadowlands" is pretty much just "Shadowlands" tbh Cheer100
[1:06:44] LordRavenspire: Sure

[1:07:01] Jack_Vikas: Visually good, terrible storytelling
[1:07:02] shinra40: they made bolvar look like a bitch
[1:07:03] ravenoushydra: because it reduces the lich king to a fucking joke?
[1:07:03] Shelana95: It is AMASING !
[1:07:04] Hunter_GS: it was amazing, whats the problem?
[1:07:04] nohomu67: Their marketing team is good, at least!
[1:07:05] SnowRhel: Chatting
[1:07:07] LordRavenspire: because they make bolvar a joke
[1:07:07] BasVanDerWerff: cause it makes zero sence
[1:07:07] KelticNight: Bolvar gets bodied like a plum KEKW
[1:07:08] Vinestra28: Bolvar getting beat is the only bad
[1:07:10] mitsoulas: asmon didnt like it so its bad
[1:07:10] truezarosian: it was the lich king
[1:07:10] rymed: I like it, narratively it's a bit meh

[1:07:15] Araken1990: Chatting
[1:07:15] Mitune: Because you learn the jailor was why Sylvannas was empowered @preachlfw
[1:07:17] Kyletyldesley: because she wins because of off screen bullshit? its wank KEKW
[1:07:18] skuull23: this is great cinematic

[1:07:41] truezarosian: @Aaspect10 enough for me!
[1:07:42] Shelana95: SO GOOD
[1:07:43] purplekittea: ive already hated sylvanas, this was just even more sylvanas
[1:07:43] aedras: The reason she destroyed the helm of domination is what made it shit
[1:07:45] markja629: Quality is good. Story is bad
[1:07:45] Hunter_GS: this cinematic was amazing
[1:07:46] anaksana: people didnt like it only because of lore reasons not because of the cinematic itsself I think
[1:07:46] truezarosian: just kidding
[1:07:46] BasVanDerWerff: the actualy quality is great the idea was trash
[1:07:47] ratskyz: Bolvar lost like a moron
[1:07:47] glenngf: It is garbage, because fuck sylvanas

[1:07:52] jakeyplops: its bad because streamer man said it was bad Chatting
[1:07:52] Mitune: Yeah sorry but Sylvannas should never be able to fight the lich king
[1:07:53] Fergyrobots: I really wish that Bolvar stood a better chance, the ending was still good
[1:07:54] Kingpin192: It's only because of the Bolvar simps
[1:07:55] Quatron: No way Bolvar the lich king gets oneclapped this easily... Just no
[1:07:55] Anganthyr: everything sylvana just annoyed me at that point
[1:07:55] Rhiven_: It's a great trailer
[1:07:56] Doimos89: true
[1:07:56] OrlaithSk: i was hyped LUL
[1:07:56] ployboi69: Bolvar became the Bitch-King Kappa
[1:07:56] UnholyLP: people are mad because that helmet dude gets rolled
[1:07:58] rymed: Bolvar jobbing was a let down, but the helm cracking was hype as fuck
[1:07:58] Shelana95: My favorite trailer @Preachlfw
[1:07:59] Lithirrdys: great scene, made bolvar look like a pussy though
[1:07:59] zReevio: its an amazing looking cutscene but bolvar shouldnt have been beaten like a little bitch
[1:08:01] DasFlume: Visually stunning, narratively bankrupt
[1:08:03] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw Sylvanas' Jailer juice wasn't yet revealed or explained, so Sylvanas has NO right to beat up Bolvar, the FUCKING LICH KING so easily. Saying this without the Shadowlands hate.
[1:08:03] ravenoushydra: that's the whole point of it KEKW
[1:08:04] Tickwick: it was stupid
[1:08:04] KelticNight: he jobs LUL

[1:08:09] Vinestra28: NODDERS Bolvar gets jobbed to easily
[1:08:10] Delthanin: I was initially super interested from the scene
[1:08:12] WhipperBrimsnapper: aye
[1:08:13] Hunter_GS: @Mitune  you can hate the shadowlands story all you want, but with the jailors powerset, he had no chance
[1:08:13] Nighthawke21: Yeah it was trash, random op sylvanus for no reason
[1:08:13] daris888: yep
[1:08:15] Chewmii: Shruge

[1:08:21] captainuselessv2: Shruge
[1:08:21] Philbobaggins12: IT WAS THE JAILOR ALL ALONG!
[1:08:22] Delthanin: yeeeeeah…
[1:08:22] zyroth_o7: Yep, main reason for me. The fight should have been more intense
[1:08:22] tetrexo_: @Aaspect10 he also embezzled charity funds, his opinion doesn't matter
[1:08:22] Warden120: I would of prefered if Sylvanus had a bit more trouble winning
[1:08:22] glenngf: bolvar losing like a little bitch was so stupid I just didn't care
[1:08:23] alpaca_god_7000: her power level = whatever the writers decide on the day

[1:08:33] mrstabs: clip that
[1:08:34] EazzyBreezzy: soundbite!
[1:08:35] FafferUK: only 12 fuckign amateur
[1:08:36] Vinestra28: SmadgeW imagine if Sylvs valks came to help
[1:08:36] Delthanin: HUH
[1:08:37] Teh_Gaffer: Sylvanas is a comic book character who is as powerful as the scene needs her to be
[1:08:37] Markreivi: Power Level = Space Marine, depends who is writing her.
[1:08:38] Atreyu_Lavellan: Dayum that's efficient
[1:08:38] Sprakenheit: Was that a confession?
[1:08:38] Rhiven_: He was shit through the whole expac
[1:08:39] aldreth0: New soundbite YEP
[1:08:39] Mattysaiyan: HUHH holup
[1:08:39] YzieGG: EZ
[1:08:43] aedras: The LK should be a gigachad
[1:08:44] Artful_Dodger: Nice. Another sound byte.
[1:08:45] onetwojango: that was .... very specific
[1:08:47] Grashock: we want proof
[1:08:58] cannedexpectations: wow's power level is always BS, changes constantly
[1:08:59] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw That's a lot of people's problem with it, if we take out Shadowlands hate.
[1:09:00] VallanceHeals: The problem with the cinematic is that it's pure rule of cool, and plays way too much on nostalgia. It's kind of a WoW cinematic by numbers, at least IMO.
[1:09:00] nightst314: he is a lvl80 Wrath boss though, legacy buff and such
[1:09:03] boartails: all her power was jailer power as it turns out
[1:09:04] EeraGames: She fought with Gen and was evenly matched iirc. So we know she isn't insane as of recent times
[1:09:09] EeraGames: And then she goes and solos a raidboss
[1:09:10] Markreivi: Yeah but remember, Bolvar is only lvl 80 Shruge
[1:09:11] Hunter_GS: its a fucking western shonen fight, who gives a shit
[1:09:12] Quatron: Bringing back Bolvar and let him get whooped by Syllie... Is SUCH a waste of Bolvar.. Just no
[1:09:15] dragothicx: Shadowlands where Sylvanas becomes a Lich Queen instead of some Jailer guy appearing from nowhere Pog
[1:09:16] WrathzzTV: i never understood the premise that bolvar was automatically OP because he had the helm on
[1:09:18] Shelana95: still best trailer hands down
[1:09:20] Elydian: "Magic"
[1:09:20] SiriusSion: i love the dodging his hammer bits
[1:09:24] Warden120: She won too easily
[1:09:25] Kyletyldesley: No thanks mate I made a deal with a guy youve never seen I win now YEP
[1:09:27] Anganthyr: it looks good but the content is just bollocks
[1:09:28] Vinestra28: @Quatron and then making him spend the entire expansion being a sad sack
[1:09:36] EeraGames: @Warden120 big yeppers
[1:09:36] yuiona: i think the main complaint is that she seems way too strong
[1:09:38] cannedexpectations: a fireball from a mage sometimes can kill frost giant, sometimes can't light a campfire
[1:09:39] alpaca_god_7000: This was such fucking horseshit
[1:09:43] majkos: Bolvar no match for Jailor, he was planning this since WC3
[1:09:43] glenngf: She might as wel have fortnite danced on him
[1:09:44] ployboi69: SUCC
[1:09:47] soth_klf: i mean, the cinematic is still sick
[1:09:48] ratskyz: comparing this to DF or WW LULW
[1:09:49] Hunter_GS: this was fucking cool man
[1:09:51] LordRavenspire: this is so dumb haha
[1:09:51] TreyMetalGamingTTV: bitch var
[1:09:56] Axxi5: It wasnt even a real fight but a 1 sided beating
[1:09:59] EazzyBreezzy: How does wow Not have a animated Series?!
[1:09:59] angrypenguinss: Is this the real or fake Preachlfw?
[1:09:59] ravenoushydra: I love when my favorite legendary characters get reduced to jobbers by shit writers ResidentSleeper
[1:09:59] EeraGames: full DIESOFCRINGE
[1:10:00] Allessii: If Blizz looses Terran Gregory they are lost
[1:10:01] OspreyRed: yep

[1:10:14] ployboi69: Herta VA from Honkai star rail BTW Kappa
[1:10:15] Cryptoji_Jojoji: The line makes no sense when she just rips it apart
[1:10:15] gothen123: Litch queen
[1:10:16] dragothicx: it would have been better tho Chatting
[1:10:16] alpaca_god_7000: we only expected that because that's the level of writing we have been getting
[1:10:17] nohomu67: NOCRINGE SLAY LICH QUEEN
[1:10:18] majkos: Lich Bitch
[1:10:20] soth_klf: Muh Queen
[1:10:20] Impurite: Not anywhere near in character so I didn't Shruge
[1:10:21] hery41: they based the entirety of shadowland's pitch around this twist
[1:10:21] aedras: But we got this crap
[1:10:24] Dernsby: @ployboi69 Wait for real?
[1:10:24] annapurna__: NOCRINGE MY QUEEN
[1:10:25] hery41: they had nothing else
[1:10:25] Vinestra28: Bitch Queen was tossed around too
[1:10:27] tecnicallynot: NOCRINGE
[1:10:29] rymed: NOCRINGE MY QUEEN
[1:10:30] skuull23: her being lich queen would of been way better expansion
[1:10:33] markja629: This is why it sucks. she turns up with un-explained insane power and beats the Lich King in 5 seconds

[1:10:46] Tartuccio: DIESOFCRINGE
[1:10:46] Allessii: DIESOFCRINGE
[1:10:46] Quatron: Breaking the helmet was unexpected for sure..   But again, Bolvar getting railroaded for this made the entire video bad..
[1:10:46] hery41: its like they thought of the twist and then went backwards
[1:10:46] ColdIceCreamMan: stil doesn't make sense
[1:10:46] alpaca_god_7000: retcon: the expansion
[1:10:47] Vinestra28: @ployboi69 @Dernsby Si patty

[1:11:07] Dragonnan_Drakelos: I expected many things, but I didn't expect 2 things. I didn't expect her putting it on, nor did I expect her to shatter it. I expected like using it for some ritual or giving it to someone and that person putting it on, or similar.
[1:11:08] trebolf: NOCRINGE This world is a prison

[1:13:02] Doimos89: people are memeing noone in their right mind think it's shit
[1:13:02] InfiniteWizards: War Within is an amazing cinematic as an art piece, but gave me zero hype for the game
[1:13:02] kuskapog: there is nothing happening in this trailer. just pretty graphics and nothing else, absolute worst

[1:13:28] Gaphill: this was amazing, but naturally not for 12y olds
[1:13:29] skuull23: its good if it was a mid expansion bit like bfa ones, but as a trailer to hype for expansion doesnt do anything

[1:14:04] LordRavenspire: this is the main cinematic tho?
[1:14:04] Azalis1701: It's really hard to separate a trailer from your feelings about how it ended up. I still think The Last Jedi has an amazing trailer but it's hard to look at it
[1:14:09] mitsoulas: Anduin crying = good cinematic :P
[1:14:09] Warden120: I just don't think the dialogue is that good.
[1:14:11] Hunter_GS: KEKW

[1:14:12] truezarosian: @Kyletyldesley THATS true

[1:14:15] SirAppleheart: @stopher121 That whole series of BFA cinematics were excellent

[1:14:18] Boxer502: They did a LOT OF cinematics for BFA.

[1:14:21] hery41: copium
[1:14:21] ravenofjudgement: nice COPIUM
[1:14:22] Dubbauril: bin cam> these traileri
[1:14:24] BlindOwlInTree: legion had two trailers
[1:14:25] HottubFluffy: @Preachlfw i love the cinematic but i cannot get over the fact that anduin looks to much like steven amell
[1:14:25] alwiro: @realnzall keeping an eye on the binman and if he actually shows up today :D

[1:14:30] Nobbel87: df got 2 cutscenes, imagine this one will get too
[1:14:31] ColdIceCreamMan: they'll do another trailer. this is part of the harbinger sequence
[1:14:32] batmern_: COPIUM
[1:14:32] Pixelatedjustice: SLICE IS RIGHT UP
[1:14:32] Umseslad: I expect a cool as fuck trailer with many explosions, flares and monsters YEP
[1:14:33] markja629: true
[1:14:33] nezz231: is this guy high?
[1:14:33] loblow: why is there a bin cam?
[1:14:33] UniqeornRider: I love the change in his eyes as he holds the sword Arthas style
[1:14:34] ZakuzaGB: i get what chris is saying
[1:14:34] Ashidomus: Old Soldier was so good
[1:14:34] skuull23: true

[1:14:39] 625th: COPIUM for sure
[1:14:39] BigWaldo7713: i disagree
[1:14:39] amphila87: anyone saying that video is crap is soulless, poor & needs to be killed asap
[1:14:40] LordRavenspire: this was at blizzcon though
[1:14:42] Thornefield: Honestly I would like more cutscenes.
[1:14:42] ployboi69: COPIUM
[1:14:43] SiriusSion: I mean you say its not marketing but it made me want to play the game again...
[1:14:43] Dragonnan_Drakelos: Old Soldier didn't have the BfA logo in it, did it?
[1:14:43] Hunter_GS: im not expecting another one either
[1:14:43] zyroth_o7: Im waiting for the second expansion in the trilogy, the war within is gonna be a testing ground
[1:14:44] ravenofjudgement: @Preachlfw I'm more invested into Bin Cam than entire War Within
[1:14:45] Kyletyldesley: can we get this boy a shave and haircut so the voice fits
[1:14:45] knukles0: true you are not getting new players in with this trailer
[1:14:47] elderratt: @Preachlfw sylvanas was always powerful sadly and in shadowlands was relegated to idiot despite her being storywise undefeated
[1:14:49] OspreyRed: he does make a good point though NODDERS
[1:14:52] TreyMetalGamingTTV: who
[1:14:54] ZakuzaGB: if your marketing to people that dont play wow as well you need something hype
[1:14:54] Fergyrobots: Considering the cutscenes we had for BFA with saurfang and anduin, this was just another of those. The actual trailers are more bombastic.
[1:14:56] SirAppleheart: Stony Tony was full CGI, no in-game
[1:14:58] LordRavenspire: koranos
[1:14:58] Rhiven_: I think they'll do another. This doesn't say enough about the expansion
[1:15:00] Mak2349: HUHH

[1:15:19] Teh_Gaffer: dragonflight? that was the cinematic of all time

[1:15:19] sstarfall_: true though
[1:15:21] LordRavenspire: COPIUM
[1:15:22] DzikiWegorz1223: ppl dont like it because there is no action. it's because it's another cinematic where 2 ppl are just kinda moaning and dont take action - good comparison is Legion trailer

[1:15:34] Delthanin: Chris is probably right
[1:15:37] jimdowg: once it’s made it’s much easier to make more
[1:15:40] Wodiin: This is mocaped
[1:15:40] CoffeeASAP: if they can pull of a good story this will be seen as hype retroactively, but they usually struggle with that in wow
[1:15:44] Mattysaiyan: Holy COPIUM for 2nd trailer
[1:15:46] spudmorph: start with 2 characters, add more later
[1:15:46] grimeylive: it's not mocap
