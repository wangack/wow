[0:01:32] dankgamer97: Tjena
[0:01:33] Joke_Fistweaver: had you in my lobby yesterday, you got so grieved by a ww who was breaking all your sheeps
[0:01:58] Joke_Fistweaver: you should just expect people to break it
[0:02:37] Joke_Fistweaver: yeah so I was the fistweaver in your lobby
[0:02:43] Joke_Fistweaver: so In theory it should have been easy
[0:03:25] Joke_Fistweaver: that was with Jaimie Mariabanks on Tol vir
[0:03:29] Joke_Fistweaver: with that sus priest
[0:04:23] bossjeezy: happy friday booois
[0:04:36] Joke_Fistweaver: the thing is rdruid is just too good in shuffle, they have almost 0 weakness
[0:04:39] Nextrkw: u think ure playing wotlk chilling in darnassus?
[0:04:45] Joke_Fistweaver: apart from x4 melee lobby that go them all game
[0:05:23] Nextrkw: whats that number when u open pvp tab next to ur 3v3?
[0:05:26] Emiliiooz: u never shuffle your dh?
[0:05:28] Nextrkw: i couldnt see properly
[0:05:42] buzuzuk1: hey raikuu! we are running ww/arcane/paladin but we are having trouble against caster cleaves and ele shaman comps. how should we approach those comps? ty !
[0:05:48] Joke_Fistweaver: I find that people are just CCing arcane mage now with incaps/random kicks
[0:05:53] Joke_Fistweaver: it really hurts your damage
[0:06:00] Joke_Fistweaver: and shifting change sucks
[0:07:00] Djalextv98: haj
[0:07:09] ejj_20: what's amazing about the change...is that it still does nature damage. So we don't even get the benefit of our mastery
[0:07:19] ejj_20: it's exclusively there to shit on it for pvp
[0:07:50] Ceribi: wait what change we talkin about
[0:08:17] notMyk: raiku the oracle coming in again with the "there might be changes"
[0:08:23] Chocapic88: Chocapic88 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Hola hola
[0:08:43] allport22: i just find in general SS isnt set up for mage lol - its perma trained, then if you kite whole game they just swap team mate and they die
[0:08:47] alegpetrovich: what are the chances we get changes tonight?
[0:09:08] Joke_Fistweaver: being initiator as a mage right now feels really bad, you're right
[0:09:38] Chocapic88: Such a massive nerf that shifting power is now arcane
[0:10:45] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Raiku
[0:11:01] Joke_Fistweaver: yeah the blazing soul meta of season 3
[0:11:05] Joke_Fistweaver: was so shit vs season 1 and 2
[0:11:30] tarifa123456: is that the same with rogues right, low win rate in low mmr
[0:11:55] MartyrTV1: feels like any season jungle cleave isnt dominant rmx becomes S tier
[0:11:56] MartyrTV1: ngl
[0:12:30] Joke_Fistweaver: by your logic, if they cater to the lower level players, and they buff mage, wouldn't that buff RMD even more at the pro level?
[0:12:48] allport22: @randomafk ...... i think you miss his point entirely
[0:13:01] allport22: its literally the point hes making
[0:13:10] Joke_Fistweaver: so how do you fix the problem?
[0:13:23] MartyrTV1: u cant fix the problem
[0:13:52] MartyrTV1: wow pvp fundamentals ceased to exist with implementation of dampening and healers being able to heal for 1+ min with sub 5% mana
[0:14:00] MartyrTV1: details addon decides wow pvp now
[0:14:23] Joke_Fistweaver: if they balanced the game at the 1.6/.8 level, what changes would you expect to see?
[0:14:32] Joke_Fistweaver: like would every class have a MS/stun or?
[0:15:20] allport22: NGL surely the easiest change it put CC back to how it was and go back to 2 min trinkets
[0:16:36] Djalextv98: give mage MS poggers
[0:17:01] Djalextv98: i want ineffable truth back on my hpal :)
[0:17:01] Joke_Fistweaver: they should have 20% ms on their chill effect
[0:17:09] tarifa123456: remove MS for all specs
[0:17:10] claud1928: i main healer and i think they should revert the cc changes, people just complained about the wrong issue
[0:17:23] Berlyirltv: oh man the MS cope
[0:17:39] Djalextv98: @Berlyirltv hej börli
[0:17:54] allport22: @claud1928 Pve players complaining that they get CC - or dead rating healers just standing mid and wondering why they get CC
[0:17:56] SmoudiniTTV: doube affli :P
[0:20:19] MartyrTV1: wait
[0:20:27] MartyrTV1: why is lontar is at this mmr on his 1 day old alt
[0:20:28] MartyrTV1: FeelsWeirdMan
[0:20:52] allport22: Also they need to reduce the mobility on some melee... like how is war one of the most mobile classes there is lol!

[0:22:02] notMyk: lovely shuffle experience
[0:22:12] notMyk: main bracket of wow btw :)
[0:22:14] Hilding: do you like arcane most in shuffle
[0:22:51] sourbutts: that priest is losing his mind irl rn
[0:24:36] sourbutts: just pump dmg and win in damp, like every solo shuffle
[0:24:38] 0xaxzy: are you allowed to kick?
[0:24:38] kallesurf: lol
[0:25:07] 0xaxzy: sec, ad
[0:25:12] 0xaxzy: back
[0:25:26] sourbutts: thats true tbf, going for a sheep with no prior CC is a death sentence
[0:27:52] 404Miray: @Raikubest can u link wa for havoc please?
[0:29:04] 0xaxzy: @404Miray go on *** if you didnt know
[0:29:32] Cvarks: what you think about flashbang shiftin power
[0:31:34] leyzini: can you show dmg breakdown of this round?
[0:31:58] Ambiantzz: same with affli
[0:32:03] Ambiantzz: even worse
[0:32:20] Faketagsy: @Ambiantzz afli feels omega fried
[0:32:23] Ambiantzz: who even asked for this
[0:33:10] Cvarks: my first q sesh w it I got kicked on it at the worst times trying to setup my damage, it’s so aids
[0:34:06] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Raiku and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[0:34:48] Berlyirltv: You can argue that all good comps require MS. But why not just give every class 2x stack gapclosers also then, its unfair that a mage can blink out of stuns so why should we not just give everyone an option to blink out of stuns
[0:35:06] wggwf: !ui
[0:35:21] Varaben: @Berlyirltv Kappa
[0:35:28] Cvarks: yea bro exactly
[0:35:34] Berlyirltv: while we're at it we should just remove classes and everyone plays the same generic human with same abilities
[0:35:35] Cvarks: and now I’m just fucked on it
[0:35:47] RedeemedbyJesus: @notMyk Definitely the most enjoyable to play/watch for the non-pros. Playing/watching the same 2-3 meta comps with the same dozen people in 3s at 2k+ rating is too stale.
[0:35:51] kelqoo: soul rot is shadow now aswell right? so not only mage getting cucked Sadge
[0:36:11] Faketagsy: @kelqoo never felt more fried to play afli
[0:36:12] Raikubest: Mes weakaura
[0:36:20] skeeveert: @kelqoo same with mw monk as well
[0:36:48] skeeveert: all covenent abilities are on same spell school now i think right?
[0:37:07] Cvarks: also not being able to shift lockouts anymore is kinda aids but obv that is easier to manage
[0:37:26] kelqoo: @Faketagsy yeah dont think imma logg my lock for now xd
[0:37:34] Varaben: can pallies use divine toll while kicked now?
[0:38:07] NlPPEE: is patchnotes out?
[0:38:52] 404Miray: ty <3
[0:39:06] lzd_nsfl: !wa

[0:39:19] Hilding: 24 hours stream today then
[0:39:22] nizzyfr: will they have class changes even with AWC soon? :O
[0:39:59] flawfox: and a rdruid
[0:40:03] flawfox: you forgot to mention
[0:40:04] Varaben: @nizzyfr theyve definitely made class changes right before AWC in the paast
[0:41:27] nizzyfr: @Varaben oh good to know thanks
[0:42:38] thawg: it randomly dispelled i watched clip
[0:42:49] thawg: it was like on last tick of lava dot but still
[0:42:53] tarifa123456: why is outlaw bad in low MMR ?
[0:42:54] thawg: dont think flame shock would break it
[0:43:05] Hilding: how much dam that round
[0:43:11] TheNutcracka: pog
[0:43:12] Kanketotv: are you 2.8 yet?

[0:45:22] lzd_nsfl: Do you ever play blink stun vs rog
[0:50:00] gaabaage: what a round
[0:50:00] flawfox: wow

[0:50:09] RedeemedbyJesus: How much damage does the mw have?
[0:51:32] batu_x96: op again ofc
[0:51:46] batu_x96: blizzard loves rogues
[0:51:59] didieris: whats that green stuff on the ground ?

[0:52:26] didieris: ah i see
[0:52:45] Blueninezero: the shifting power looks great too
[0:54:55] batu_x96: which weakaura is this for enemy cds?
[0:55:24] quinnm27: big swap ww? no trink
[0:55:30] 0xaxzy: get a trainhorn weakaura for when you are casting poly because jumpscare = accidentally pressing movement keys
[0:55:32] quinnm27: nice nice
[0:56:40] 0xaxzy: to make you not cast poly

[1:16:49] MartyrTV1: drawing ur team icon

[1:17:21] Nadasky: I find it crazy like I remember not too long ago you had barely played much arcane but now in df it's your favourite blindcBlep
[1:17:26] galdinator: alot of people say arcane is the hardest spec in the game for pvp do u agree
[1:17:49] MartyrTV1: blizz artist only draw ur team icon if u make it top 12 right?

[2:41:06] mightyoo: DF enough
[2:41:13] Castorcato: I hate it when you displace in mega damp and heal for 2k atpRtsd
[2:41:14] mightyoo: if ppl think its good xD
[2:41:19] hadoukyn: aging
[2:41:25] igkas: !awc
[2:41:33] igkas: who's your healer for awc?
[2:41:42] pweepysonkun: even DF professions felt like a good move

[2:42:02] SirBeaverTeeth: he didnt wanna play

[2:43:20] Malte_L: you inv you drop combat how is that a bug
[2:43:44] Castorcato: @hadoukyn do you think if Alexander the Great didnt die at an early age he could have reached manchuria?
[2:44:14] Artixono: how long is your solo shuffles queues? @Raikubest
[2:44:20] hadoukyn: he would've get assassinated anyways so no
[2:44:23] nzdog: Have you tried any god comp do you think it's viable?
[2:44:54] gyalsey: @Castorcato his army was on the verge of mutiny more than once, he was already pushing it too much
[2:44:58] Gregg95: so many people watching stream, que dudes espessially healers
[2:48:01] Joke_Fistweaver: holy paladin int resto druid is just depressing
[2:48:04] Joke_Fistweaver: into

[2:48:12] juicy_blaze: yo peace bro, how are you?
[2:48:35] Malte_L: cant win with the daggers
[2:48:36] Malte_L: cursed
[2:50:31] Bushido288: Damn bro sounded like you were actually suffering KEKW
[2:51:11] Wizzuri: You would win 100% of the games with dagger if you had some music while pumping
[2:51:16] Wizzuri: true story
[2:51:20] Wizzuri: <3
[2:51:22] Joke_Fistweaver: what's ur win rate with whaazz in shuffle? like 90%
[2:53:20] kulyowow: 14 raiders from kulyowow have joined! 
[2:53:30] tinderx: no way kulyowow raid that guy is jacked

[2:53:41] kulyowow: he need more viewers
[2:53:42] kulyowow: i think
[2:55:06] boltqt_: druid just let that dk sit 3 sheeps, a root, and a hoj
[2:55:10] boltqt_: didnt even matter
[2:55:34] MaximusTVlive: any mage changes apart from shifting?
[2:55:50] honsou2: @boltqt_ its shuffle, comp rng with player input to trick your brain
[2:56:56] mancloy: I swear every time i faced Titarie last season he dbd me out every alter to dc me aswell so disgusting
[2:56:59] mancloy: dirty gamers
[2:57:44] SirBeaverTeeth: i saw infy go 0-6 the other day, now 6-0 :D
[2:57:56] Joke_Fistweaver: how did you fix your gladius btw? are you using bicmex version?
[2:57:57] azliaris1: that's just shuffle
[2:57:58] MrRaisin7: Your gameplay was great
[2:59:04] willofaronax: Is arcane that popular now? Earlier today u had another arcane in lobby
[2:59:21] azliaris1: do you agree that deep freeze would make mage broken
[2:59:26] willofaronax: Doesnt shuffle try to not have duplicate spec unless too many playing certain spec like dh?
[2:59:50] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Raiku
[3:00:26] Anabolixtv: What spec are the RM in RMD?
[3:00:37] azliaris1: atleast you can kite and cast cast, SP cant kite and cast cast
[3:00:42] Joke_Fistweaver: arcane/sub
[3:00:43] azliaris1: cant cast
[3:01:10] Joke_Fistweaver: oh really?
[3:01:13] Joke_Fistweaver: fair, mb
[3:01:28] tastyyyyy: MLD maybe?
[3:02:23] Raikubest: Meeles are much better than casters
[3:02:24] Raikubest: right now
[3:02:26] Raikubest: so dbl caster
[3:02:27] Raikubest: is rly bad
[3:02:34] idiot_63: Sadge
[3:02:45] Joke_Fistweaver: could you make WW/arcane work?
[3:02:52] Caedalade: you see much dev/outlaw/hpal or rdru
[3:02:52] Raikubest: Casters are good because they can get carried by their meele and they are a good support for the meele
[3:02:53] azliaris1: the best casters dont even cast
[3:02:56] Caedalade: comp is strong
[3:02:58] azliaris1: ele/boomy/destro
[3:03:15] Raikubest: Outlaw ele druid, Ww dk sham, Outlaw arcane druid
[3:03:30] taylors09: dh/ele
[3:03:32] ratatatuixdddd: what about dh bm
[3:03:34] Caedalade: Typically beats mage version from what I've experience - NA and EU is always diff meta though
[3:03:38] ratatatuixdddd: bm + dk *
[3:03:39] Caedalade: and you beat double melee
[3:03:47] infernion: That's why lock sucks atm cuz it auto loses to all 3
[3:03:51] Joke_Fistweaver: where does hunter + dk come into it?
[3:03:53] Caedalade: there are no good ele on NA
[3:04:20] infernion: It is true tho
[3:04:39] infernion: Potentially RLD can win RMD ye
[3:04:46] mlgsap: Thug cleave is rly good into those
[3:04:48] infernion: No he was not lol, Chan also says lock sucks
[3:05:09] boltqt_: But the underlying theme seems to be outlaw
[3:05:10] Anabolixtv: rip boomy dh?
[3:05:20] Ceribi: lock is good just the meta not good for it rn
[3:05:39] taylors09: boomy getting bullied by those comps
[3:05:40] taylors09: kekw
[3:05:46] Braunijs: chans dk is higher rated than his lock no ?
[3:06:10] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Raiku
[3:06:23] Malte_L: Kappa
[3:06:29] Skyle_win: i mean raiku in general mage just feels weak af in shuffle...
[3:06:44] Castorcato: it should be a 1 sec cast, cause even with 80% haste its like 1.5sec its shit
[3:06:54] SweRobb: kom igen Raiku varför ska man prenumerera när du bara kör shuffle hela tiden i din stream
[3:07:03] boltqt_: whats the damage amp on surge & duration?
[3:07:05] Malte_L: A 2 sec cast in DF feels like a 8sec soulfire in Classic KEKW
[3:07:11] akvertical: bring back legion arcane
[3:07:16] taylors09: @skillshotzz_  okay sorry raiku is lying they know better
[3:07:40] willofaronax: They probably wont do that because its problem for highest ladder only as its fraction of playerbase. In my usual 1800-1900 lobby I get it off by shimmering out midcast or something.
[3:07:44] Castorcato: triune ward
[3:07:51] infernion: Actually agree nerf mage mobility and make them a bit more tanky
[3:08:09] Castorcato: oh yeah the blink one
[3:08:12] LOVE_SOSA_666: tempest something
[3:08:18] Castorcato: and blink healed etc
[3:08:19] azliaris1: how do you win in a shuff lobby against ele/resto/dk/dh lobby
[3:08:21] willofaronax: Blazing barruer?
[3:08:22] LOVE_SOSA_666: tempest barrier
[3:08:35] LOVE_SOSA_666: i swear it is
[3:08:44] Joke_Fistweaver: blazing soul
[3:08:46] Joke_Fistweaver: that meta was trash
[3:08:50] SweRobb: @willofaronax ok i see
[3:08:51] Joke_Fistweaver: made you unkillable
[3:09:19] Joke_Fistweaver: triune ward was more pog because you could play shimmer
[3:09:26] Joke_Fistweaver: problem with blazing soul was you were tied into normal blink
[3:09:32] Castorcato: and then they nerf chrono shift anyway
[3:09:43] Nextrkw: the thing i hate about mage is that its impossible to track shimmer or cs properly
[3:09:50] badmy__: it feels like mages have some hidden modifier that increases all incoming damage
[3:09:52] codelean: yo raiku, hope you doing good?
[3:09:53] Nextrkw: its a guessing game if ppl have shimmer cs
[3:09:57] alicannuzun: how you enter darnassus any quest there ?

[3:57:51] Nateypww: maybe since you always lose vs rdruid do you think it would be better to try more of a 1 shot spec into rdruid?? like radiant spark big blasts or something?
[3:58:01] 00ZZEE: go make food during queue?
[3:58:41] liqlevlinggod: Breaks roots also

[4:05:56] galadice: when would you not need temp?
[4:06:00] Zaiyge: you can blink stun the silence off
[4:06:04] man0litos: Temp barely heals
[4:06:37] Cvarks: it was 100% of damage u took ya was completely disgusting
[4:06:43] man0litos: 40% nerf hits hard
[4:06:46] Cvarks: surprised that was ever that broken
[4:06:57] Castorcato: wish it was 70% minimum, they should have been more incremental
[4:07:01] astrry: it also ignored damp, no?
[4:07:08] Jelky55: u could cancel aura it before too
[4:07:14] man0litos: But is it though ? I mean the buff is dispellable

[4:39:07] sistahfistah1: the game is fun when u actually get to play it tho
[4:39:08] Calmseeker89: doesn't make any sense since this season is gonna be short
[4:39:09] acronymeu: anyone else getting constantly banned for shuffles? :D
[4:39:15] ryanjordanrj: dragon is kinda sick
[4:39:19] vothros: how do they balance mmr issue though if they make it too high its also bad
[4:39:21] boltqt_: yeah ret war slands was real fun
[4:39:30] Akrololz: Shadowlands didn't have shuffle so obv better by default Kappa
[4:39:41] 333silas333: shadowlands season 2 had the highest retention rate of any pvp season since legion @Raikubest

[4:40:08] matmontw: so should blizzard let people only increase cr? like 5k cr+ if it mean people gonna play
[4:40:08] boltqt_: thought i was going insane
[4:40:12] willofaronax: @qwneer im new to wow since bfa. Asking out of curiosity. Why do people pay attention to that guy? Tried watching him, he was such a weird dude. Lives with a naked egirl streamer and mods her speed dating. Tried watching his gameplay just average gameplay at 2.5k cr
[4:40:13] Lydiayang: agree I found 2400 teammates for 2s in LFG in SL, now it's dead
[4:40:20] Castorcato: sl was during lockdowns tho
[4:40:35] willofaronax: I get that he was popular in old seasons, but he seemed such a degen guy, no wonder he wad banned
[4:40:42] 333silas333: @imnotagodx yeah going from a S1 to a S2, bfa and dragonflight are worse in terms of characters on ladder
[4:40:53] imnotagodx: @willofaronax what am i reading OMEGALUL
[4:41:19] imnotagodx: @333silas333 i wish i played s2, i only played s1 fuckk

[4:43:49] chromaxen: 6-0 angle
[4:44:47] imnotagodx: @KingSeroTV wasnt s2 of SL a melee meta? at least warr meta?
[4:46:45] 333silas333: i guess there is 0 reason to play early season, like why invest hundreds of hours and sit at 2k cr when you can just play the last 3 Weeks with full inflation to get the rewards with way less effort

[5:02:14] Mirlol: raiku is hardstuck emerald 4
[5:02:15] Mirlol: rn
[5:02:27] brandogzz: INstead of nerfing the good stuff they should just buff the bad classes
[5:02:31] AstralScare: healer balance is not good
[5:02:39] wardelswijk: healer balance is way worse then dps for sure
[5:02:44] sotirios2000: maybe it s on purpose so people reroll and play more
[5:02:55] zeranni1: half of the healers are unplayable atm
[5:02:58] boostgold7: easier to nerf rdru/hpal then surely
[5:03:05] whodatroglol: i think nerf rdruid mage lock and buff ret paladins
[5:03:07] wardelswijk: nerfing hpala makes 0 sense

[5:03:41] zeranni1: just watch them
[5:03:43] brandogzz: just buff underpeforming specs
[5:03:49] wardelswijk: nah hpala meta only means all healers suck
[5:03:57] wardelswijk: and only cds save people
[5:04:11] intranett: :P

[5:05:08] Lucons1: bro they are working on new expansion now they dont give af about df
[5:05:10] whodatroglol: actually just nerf rdruid so its in the void but buff every other healer cus no1 likes rdruids and rdruids ruin the game
[5:05:12] zeranni1: they just look at some spreadsheets
[5:05:17] shredder1111: seemed like there were a lot more healers when disc was good

[5:08:50] 333silas333: Shadowlands Season 1 was 29 Weeks but kinda dead after like one month i think they had some kinda cap for ultra high mmr people
[5:08:59] kuringg: yea but that season and bfa s1 they nerfed mmr so top of the ladder froze for 3 months
[5:09:01] wardelswijk: shuffle feels hardcapped

[5:32:57] Nerilyoo: just to pay employes
[5:33:00] Necrolancer47: Riot mmo  will save us
[5:33:11] originalhellfish: which spec would you recommend for a beginner mage ? frost?
[5:33:15] Nerilyoo: all dragonflight blizz dont care
[5:33:19] Nerilyoo: pve and pvp
[5:33:34] sponkss: cough ret patch cough
[5:33:34] Holtan3111: @raikubest    Why do you craft Infuruious gear in some slots and Vibrant in other slots ? For pvp. Do the equipped effects work in arena ?
[5:33:41] Nerilyoo: but honestly i think the games pretty good in general , best expansion after wrath if u ask me
[5:33:54] Nerilyoo: dumb are only we, playing it
[5:34:02] flapperstv: S1  df was horrendus too
[5:34:22] Nerilyoo: they also should make the game free to play, bring more people in
[5:34:31] Nerilyoo: for more competition
[5:34:54] sponkss: I mean when they fixed the que times you got the ultra dogshit healers in shuffle, which wasn't fun for healers or dps
[5:35:00] loukasqq: playing CATA?
[5:35:16] Esotraz: also suffering from rogues existing Sadge
[5:35:35] Nerilyoo: and whats also killing retail, is this old staff they invent, wrath sod etc
[5:35:42] sponkss: Tbh I kinda like it now, still a mmr gap possible with healers but not as big as it was
[5:35:46] slickdaddyg69: raiku if u played warr u wouldnt have that opinion
[5:35:53] sponkss: but for some reason the mmr feels like it stagnated again
[5:36:00] Necrolancer47: same everyone is leaving
[5:36:09] romserrrr: The queues also have a negative side, i queued a fresh char (1600mmr) i won 5-1 i lost 300mmr
[5:36:11] Nerilyoo: what noway :D
[5:36:18] Nerilyoo: i think the games good, they just dont care
[5:36:27] Nerilyoo: with adjustments
[5:36:32] sponkss: I don't rly mind the balance of the patch, it's more like the mmr
[5:36:41] Nerilyoo: cause they prolly sit on next expansion
[5:36:45] ImZiimZ: playing pvp feels good
[5:36:55] ImZiimZ: everything around it feels shit
[5:36:55] MonsterhunterP: the gameplay of classes i like but the inability to fix broken stuff ingame is so bad
