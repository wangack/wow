[3:13:21] MrBoomToasted: I would rather have classic + then the expansions all over again.
[3:13:22] TopherWinsTV: Allthough, I would absolutely play Legion again
[3:13:27] dojalol: WOD HYPE
[3:13:28] elsiefleur: im good never playing past expacs again lol
[3:13:28] TopherWinsTV: I had a blast in that xpac

[3:13:41] xmedpakx: why do it

[3:14:09] TopherWinsTV: Legion had great raids, I didn't pvp at the time, so i can't speak on that
[3:14:10] pepales: i would keep doing classic stuff, like new challenge bosses or a parallel story who knows
[3:14:27] bellamii66: I can tell y'all right now which xpan I will NOT be playing again...
[3:14:30] kirbz09: I think they would stop at mop
[3:14:31] coconust1: @swifty  have you seen the Unreal engine WoW cities ?
[3:14:44] skwiglz: that would be better
[3:14:45] TopherWinsTV: They need to just let everything scale. If your raid team wants to go do MC, you should be able to. Just scale the drops
[3:14:57] xTmSpAz: yeah time warp back to classic with ur lego weps

[3:18:17] rudy_van_owen: What is endgame in HC once you hit lvl 60?
[3:19:26] TopherWinsTV: Meh, Dungeons. Maybe not raids
[3:19:34] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[3:19:35] lichtv: Gonna be no BG on HC servers?
[3:19:37] C0DEXv2: i think its only about the leveling to 60 lol not endgame
[3:19:49] KhyrisEidan: you perma
[3:20:00] roadkill3s: i might try it at least
[3:20:36] HappyTuckerr: Appeal is cheating aswell imo
[3:20:39] Faiminator: maybe they will nerf hardcore and allow max 1 death in raids when they see its too hard
[3:20:41] Oorlich: D:
[3:20:58] MaerkStrongrock: Hi swifty! Which addon are you using for your bag atm?
[3:21:02] roadkill3s: i thought the addon would show lapses in your character if you turn off the addon
[3:21:09] coconust1: Will anyone even do BWL 2nd boss in hC?
[3:21:19] TopherWinsTV: Thats the trade off. You can party and use AH, but when you die, your actually dead
[3:21:29] Oorlich: World content for the win
[3:21:34] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:21:53] Mikevilly: I really like the challenge of HC but I don't think it's going to be popular long term. I hope I'm wrong tho
[3:22:08] roadkill3s: i think more people will get to 60 though cause you aren't restricted by all the silly rules it may just take some time
[3:22:16] Oorlich: I just got out of the starting zone now im scared
[3:22:35] Faiminator: imagine raiding and getting bis gear from the raid , then dying doing a quest in the overworld because of a disconnect
[3:22:45] TopherWinsTV: there will be a couple guilds going try hard, but I don't expect much more than that
[3:22:48] lichtv: just imagine  of is gonna be content on 60 and people will do stratholm and all that dungeons

[3:24:36] coconust1: Can you do dungeons multiple times ?
[3:24:40] Rodehoved123: Ye, get all the help you can get. There no way of cheating unless you can exploit the game
[3:25:10] kozzonaxx: Swifty you been repping this game 2 long to have to explain anything 2 anyone you keep this game alive!! keep lvling legend
[3:25:12] coconust1: Maan boosting in HC will be a new all time low,
[3:25:25] kirecitsidas: it resets server side
[3:25:33] Boostewil: If you open up your friends list and click on "Raid Info" it tells you how long you have left on dungeon lockout
[3:25:50] roadkill3s: its the same reset as heroic dungeons as far as i know
[3:26:05] Beastafied: you think people will be more helpful in hardcore. and, sadly some people are not.
[3:26:15] roadkill3s: also you can't boost in hc they nerf how much xp you get in dungeons if someone is higher level
[3:26:20] TopherWinsTV: Oh man, I forgot about the voiceover addon. Need to get that
[3:26:22] coconust1: Maan bots in HC might probably have military application:p
[3:26:24] ltj_wow: @Swifty u wanna join stockades?
[3:26:26] baNjoCS2: lvl 60 cant group with lower lvls

[4:20:55] imm00rtalx: @Swifty I leveled a warrior to 22, then my gf wanted to play so we duo rogue/priest. I have so much more fun on rogue. I alrdy have a 44 warr on unofficial HC thats not dead, but goddamn its so slow, and u miss so much. Playing combat swords as human with the extra hit chance talents feel so good
[4:21:34] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:21:57] imm00rtalx: unfortunetly the alliance side of leveling involves so much more grinding compared to horde.

[4:23:26] canadiansnowtech: Wrong cave swifty it was a different one
[4:23:27] Doopness: so slow in stealth
[4:23:47] imm00rtalx: u get faster in stealth the higher rank u get on stealth

[4:24:14] imm00rtalx: also if u go combat u can reduce cd of sprint and evasion by 1.5m
[4:24:24] Greenwizard777: Subtetly rogues are faster in stealth.
[4:24:32] imm00rtalx: its insane evasion being a 5m cd and retaliation being 30m
[4:24:38] canadiansnowtech: Wrong cave
[4:24:50] chuy14rr: Rogue? Did you die again?
[4:25:34] Matt_Fortress: This cave and the furbolg one is   killing a lot of solo night elf players I assume. I remember them being very dangerous.
[4:25:49] canadiansnowtech: We can‚Äôt hear u

[4:28:06] Matt_Fortress: At least you can counter ganking rogues as a warrior quite well (if you got retal up and a decent weapon)
[4:28:13] Legend102t: I think its the same for both of them, Give them good weapons they are strong, but warrior is going to smack harder. Guess it depends on there levels too
[4:28:30] beestingb: good mage can f a rouge up
[4:29:02] NewMetaOrder: was watching your world first vid, then i dreamt i was levelling a druid and i died @ lvl 40, thank god i woke up from that
[4:29:15] Matt_Fortress: That's what happened in my cases at least, but in those cases the rogues were greedy and bad.

[4:56:24] carrastealth: When you go back to level 0 do you have to replace all your gear?
[4:56:29] firetruckdriver1: what happen to war B)

[4:57:08] Doopness: full shadow build
[4:57:10] canadiansnowtech: Wand
[4:57:13] firetruckdriver1: WAND SPEC INTO SPIRIT TAP
[4:57:15] firetruckdriver1: FOR SURE
[4:57:18] firetruckdriver1: WAND SPEC SPIRIT TAP OP
[4:57:42] Fatdownsouth: whats the lowest your health has been on this toon?
[4:57:42] canadiansnowtech: U will never beat me! Muhahah
[4:57:50] Navelji: you want to delete people with duel?
[4:58:02] firetruckdriver1: its so efficient for pure levelling, but not pvp yeah
[4:58:10] Doopness: Blackout is better free random stun is nice
[4:58:13] savagekelr: Spirit tap is a waste at lower levels bc you don‚Äôt have any spirit. Much better at higher levels
[4:58:16] Mangi28: i leveled with wands all the way to like level 30's
[4:58:19] canadiansnowtech: Lmaoooo
[4:58:55] Mangi28: i put one point in blackout when i was leveling ...
[4:59:10] Mangi28: love a random stun  :)
[4:59:35] kourtius1: 1/16
[4:59:45] Doopness: @Mangi28 did you ever notice the stun?
[4:59:55] Lunarhowl: troll priests also have shadowguard at 20 :)
[5:00:06] kourtius1: .063
[5:00:25] Mangi28: yeah , would dot like 2-3 mobs then wand em down with a renew
[5:00:30] canadiansnowtech: Yes
[5:00:30] bonicker: no
[5:00:30] Laratea: no don't end it!
[5:00:32] IcyFoe: yup
[5:00:36] Hells89: NO
[5:00:38] Haia8: Prob not
[5:00:38] Sqwabbles: pretty sure blackout can proc off shadowguard
[5:00:39] savagekelr: Blackout is worth it for trolls because at level 20 you get shadow guard which is free shadow ticks from attacks like lightning shield
[5:00:39] firetruckdriver1: why you building your entire char for duel against rog that wins anyways if they good
[5:00:45] firetruckdriver1: you can have optimal build and u still dont play ur char
[5:00:55] ironmouse34: @savagekelr LuL   is that why every priest leveling guide has you starting with Spirit Tap?  Because it's "worthless"?
[5:01:22] firetruckdriver1: @ironmouse34 yea hes wrong but its fine, u dont need spirit for 100% base spirit bonus to be nutty

[5:02:46] Deatth1: Did you die on gnome warrior last night?
[5:02:52] savagekelr: Ironmouse it‚Äôs just my personal opinion. I‚Äôm leveling priest and I find more benefit from blackout with my play style. I do wand 100% of the time and never go oom so it‚Äôs obvious the stun is better for my play style
[5:02:56] canadiansnowtech: Yes
