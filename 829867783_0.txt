[0:27:15] sgtswoll: Blood is feeling very squishy and slow right now with the beginning of xpac stats. Guardian is feeling much more easy to play and maybe I’m just enjoying the more simple rotation since content is new and I want to focus more on mechanics.

[1:38:06] Kampfire7: @TheItalianStallion321 im with you atleast 3 or 4 hours
[1:38:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Rottencoarse You have to understand it's been crunch time this week for ppl wanting to get thier legos since M+ opens and most ppl will be doing them. Also, with Mythic lockout, Heroic is more ideal to "spam" to get legos since you have a higher chance of it dropping than from Normal.
[1:38:11] Frostfury: Prepare for lags and ques.
[1:38:23] Caaethil: @havocg WeakAuras, looks like one of Luxthos'.

[1:39:10] Rottencoarse: @I_DoctorSatan_I that does not mean them leaving the grp and me waiting for 15 mins to find ppl to continue
[1:39:16] excessior: its the interns just walk to the next platform

[1:39:32] NoPanicBro: u cant 1 shot him in HC
[1:39:38] sLogOG: you only have 2 portals on heroic, so basicly heroic is longer and harder in theory :D
[1:39:41] monkmedian: heroic only has 2 portals yea
[1:39:42] ohbunga: is it just me or does mueh'zala's model remind me more of a warcraft reforged model than a wow

[1:40:27] TheInfamousEkim: you needed that one! XD
[1:40:28] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Rottencoarse I mean, it is what it is. Since M+ is up, ppl won't bne leaving as much. Be glad it's happening now with Normal through Mythic now than later with M+ since the gear will be better which is more incentive for ppl to stay.
[1:40:31] excessior: click on the totems
[1:40:32] Kromede: mystique raider NotLikeThis
[1:40:35] nixxy_7: Yes they made it ez with the Dungeon for daily :) since only 1-3 quests world quests

[3:53:03] LunarVaporz: No
[3:53:03] Sincline387: lots of people will have it on console so no
[3:53:05] UglyMoo4510: are servers back up yet

[3:53:10] remenu: Cyberpunk is not PC only
[3:53:11] funKShun: gaming is full of casuals with kids KEKW
[3:53:12] Osskssa: maybe
[3:53:13] tyrel_jones: Cyberpunk is going to be so so overrated @Towelliee
[3:53:13] Okanta: Cyberpunk will get too many sales on PS5 and Xbox, so no, it won't beat strictly for PC sales
[3:53:13] actionring: nah 2 million ish day `1

[3:53:37] SSD511_: I don’t think so some people don’t like games like that
[3:53:43] 91Niki: If Cyberpunk was PC ONLY , maybe. But we gotta remember, Wow runs on a potato, Cyberpunk doesn't. Which has a huge saying
[3:53:47] Okanta: PS5 and Xbox will take too many sales from PC
[3:53:47] Cabbageman007: Is the increase in sales due to people being home because of Covid?
[3:53:47] Panadol324: if people playd Deus Ex they will love it
[3:53:50] YoooDeej: the heck I got a Realm List and number of characters already, its gonna be up quick
[3:53:52] Moskeebee: "Fortified, Bursting, Volcanic, Prideful " BTW
[3:53:52] Mufinz21: game is way too overhyped
[3:53:53] ThaOriginalGamester: We're an elite group of consumers. very picky with our purchases. not easily swayed by marketing

[3:54:30] cprn: prolly day 1 sales include pre-orders for the past year
[3:54:31] Shrenko: @Towelliee the reviews didnt have the day 1 patch of 46GB thats probably have all the bug fixes in it
[3:54:32] OPENS1NNER: The PC version is nothing but bugs
[3:54:34] TMMOOF: wtf is that game? Only game I know is WoW
[3:54:34] killawatts75: Cyberpunk is so overhyped
[3:54:34] funKShun: They did not play the day 1 patch
[3:54:35] DoubleNova: Its hype
[3:54:41] Moskeebee: @Kinghorn my raider io discord bot just said
[3:54:41] pharmaticus: don't want to download the 43gig patch before it even launches
[3:54:42] KonradGM: who still reads kotaku? lol
[3:54:45] Jarlan23: how is it overhyped its at 91 on metacritici with 44 reviews
[3:54:45] skulldrag03: What is the Levling WA
[3:54:46] crickeyscricket: @Towelliee Well, cyberpunk trailer on one YT channel alone had 27mil views in 2 weeks
[3:54:47] weatherghost23: If you think it’s overhyped then don’t play it let people play what they want
[3:54:48] Okanta: they said it's going to ship with a ton of bugs that will be corrected in future patches
[3:54:48] tarrondor: That's what day one patches are for
[3:54:49] Blah206: THE DAY 1 PATCHES WILL DO LITERALLY NOTHING. No one has EVEN SEEN this game running on console.
[3:54:55] JayWilsonHere: Game will be awesome, but buggy. Their games are always buggy at launch.
[3:54:55] RagingPunk: never hype games
[3:54:58] Motivess: I think the game will be amazing, but you have to enjoy the style of game, slow paced rpg with extensive progression
[3:55:03] Kameeni: @Towelliee I had a gift card, so I paid like 5 euro for it. Would have skipped for a sale if I didn't
[3:55:07] Herzenliegen: @Towelliee Happy Birthday!!!!
[3:55:07] Ghhost117: I think CP2077 has an impossible task of performing up to the hype. It has been through such a long wait, gotten so much attention after CDPR blew up with the Witcher 3
[3:55:10] Densetsu_: Some reviews says its a game that will be rememberd as one of the greats RPGs of all time aswell so.
[3:55:12] cprGhost: all the reviews are prerelease versions there is still a 50gb download plus the day one patch so i think CP will be fine
[3:55:18] funKShun: monkaS
[3:55:21] DigitalChill: if I don't ascend to another form of existence from playing Cyberpunk I will be pissed SwiftRage
[3:55:23] Kneeels: are you working out at home now that gyms are closing down?
[3:55:27] Mallaes: SMOrc
[3:55:27] PayneAS: Pantheon might be a bit more overhyped. LOL
[3:55:29] shrektard69: am i the only one completely uninterested in Cyberpunk
[3:55:29] 91Niki: Kotaku has worse journalists than DailyMail.
[3:55:31] Shrenko: is that Thrall
[3:55:31] exodusarias: are you using morphvox pro @Towelliee I use the same one on my streams LUL
[3:55:32] killawatts75: I’ve asked like 6 people in my guild what cyberpunk is about and they can’t even explain it they just bought it.
[3:55:33] neverbornlucky: Towelliee whats going on I can't log into my Server on NA it says servers down
[3:55:34] weatherghost23: Every game has bugs it’s not going to be perfect

[3:55:37] Kisswani: It does have Keanu Reeves tho , that's a plus
[3:55:39] zminny: I feel like every big launch has been overhyped tho for the last few years
[3:55:41] hooliggan: Can you please you wanna play a game @Towelliee
[3:55:43] freshlux: Star Citizen was overhyped and over funded
[3:55:44] Voidheim: the fuck is Pantheon?
[3:55:45] blinca: wh OMEGALUL
[3:55:45] Aron3DP: Anthem was overhyped as shit
[3:55:47] Shrenko: what KEKW
[3:55:47] Blah206: Man everyone giving CDPR a pass is a fool imo. 10 year dev cycle. 4 delays. No next gen versions. LITERALLY no excuse.
[3:55:47] Biggyp1: what is that lol
[3:55:48] deletedchannellllll123333: how tf is he online still?
[3:55:49] Phantom_wulfstan: most the hype is because the delays imo i don't think its going to live up to the hype its been delayed and teased way to long. will prob be a good game tho @towelliee
[3:55:49] BubbaChubbs420: who?
[3:55:49] deletedchannellllll123333: lol

[3:55:56] duhworks: the review says it's like 8 or 9 out of 10
[3:55:57] ThaOriginalGamester: Most overhyped game? Fable aka Project Ego
[3:56:02] chad10232423: Ill just let the game speak for itself when it comes out
[3:56:04] crickeyscricket: I read through a lot of those reviews, even the bad reviews said the game is good, just bad reviews due to bugs

[3:57:23] Phantom_wulfstan: the delay was for both last gen consoles tbh its a free upgrade anyway
[3:57:25] rimo82: its gonna be a shitshow 100%
[3:57:25] JimtheSFN: There were no preview keys given for consoles so no idea how it works either.

[3:58:09] Blah206: THEY DIDN'T EVEN ALLOW REVIEWERS TO USE THEIR OWN FOOTAGE. That's how bad it is. No one has seen this thing running on consoles. They specifically did not send out console codes

[3:58:41] killawatts75: @bdonny69 it’s super buggy tho
[3:58:42] GrethamPlz: what's your NA covenant?

[3:58:54] 91Niki: It's BOUND to let people down with this hype
[3:58:54] Shrenko: because Witcher 3 was

[3:59:04] Velashen: I'm sure it will be a fun game. Hype is whatever..
[3:59:05] freshlux: They said same thing about Star Citizen Lol
[3:59:05] GrethamPlz: @shrektard69 ty

[3:59:26] duhworks: ppl really saying its the GOAT?
[3:59:27] Dave_Growl: Its got keanu! cannot be bad
[3:59:33] DoubleNova: Whats the over/under odds of a smooth launch?
[3:59:37] zminny: but towelliee gamers are doing that for every big game the gaming community just hypes the shit out of everything then rips it for one small thing that gets fixed in a month
[3:59:37] Steadmoh190: i played ac vallhalla now that game is a hot mess of bug, im sure it cant be worse than that game
[3:59:41] Terminator_Puppy: TBF they've postponed the game for months, crunched after promising no crunch
[3:59:42] Okanta: towLul towLul
[3:59:43] plate_of_food: Very sage
[3:59:44] ifiputyouinameatgrinder: idc if people overhype and get dissapointed bc im sure ill, on a realistic level, enjoy it

[3:59:44] Phantom_wulfstan: tbh i tempered my expectations after the 2nd delay

[3:59:55] DopeBandit: i saw a video where a 3090 ran cyber punk at 40-60fps imagine a GPU trying to run that game thats 3-5 years old. Probably cant @Towelliee
[3:59:55] Blah206: As an RPG. It holds. And a game with this much hype will almost never deliver. But still
[3:59:56] azizo: Another Prot Pala? PogU
[3:59:59] crickeyscricket: @DopeBandit that doesnt tell us much, what resolution? RTX on? etc...

[4:00:26] Osskssa: no, i didnt have one bug in Valhalla
[4:00:27] brevanj: Some reviewers have said that even after 4 delays Cyberpunk still isn't ready and should've been delayed further.

[4:01:02] Okanta: bugs don't ruin games for me. bad gameplay/storylines do. the bugs can be fixed
[4:01:08] Steadmoh190: vallhalla has game breaking bugs like corrupted saves, constant crashing etc

Because your main have done all keystone sand have to wait till 9. AM. But the alt who hasn't done all mythic can go in with ur team and do the myth and get a keystone(Maybe) Then you can do that keystone and all on the team though that keystone will get their keystones, and do them, and at 9. AM you might get the vault rewards???

[4:36:39] printwulf: why does blizzard insist on doing server maintenance in the beginning of the day rather than at like 3am like most companies?
[4:36:40] GoGetItKo: Streamer aura SeemsGood
[4:36:45] Radiag: freefella in classic sometimes the servers would be down for a very long time and then not work properly, usually it takes nothing more than a few hours these days

[4:37:29] cofejar: World boss will be up for sure

[6:11:19] andi2042: is na down right now ?
[6:11:24] Vivelli: de gallo?
[6:11:25] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee did you switch?
[6:11:27] Vigi9413: no reroll tokens? even with wrath of the jailer and world bosses?
[6:11:28] PvtHudson093: Peko Peko
[6:11:29] Shayuki: @Leonidus7 Really, what spec did you use for layer 3?
[6:11:30] NispyCriblet: Is that a weak aura to see what the trinket is gonna do??
[6:11:34] Miracl3Work3r: FOR THE FORSWORN!!!~!
[6:11:35] ssjw1337: I already know that I'm not going to get anything from the world boss.
[6:11:35] TheGreasyMallard: Towelliee is that your weak aura for prot tank? I have to setup mine today.
[6:11:36] SethSteckler: @andi2042 Yea til 2PM PST
[6:11:44] billybaroo1: pico de gallo is cool. he works at the mexican joint here
[6:11:45] andi2042: @SethSteckler ty sir
[6:11:46] Roobi_doobi: doing torghast as boomy was rough af, swapped to bear and it's a joke
[6:11:49] Leonidus7: @Shayuki I main shadow priest but I also did it on my frost mage
[6:11:49] CrunkyBrewster: this is how dumb i was./ i just found out last night that Torghast powers can stack. FailFish
[6:12:00] seitharyn: @CrunkuTV map pin locations are built into the game now, you can set a pin and then shift click it into chat
[6:12:01] TheVigiliance: Moved away from TN for shadowlands, fuck that
[6:12:06] BobbyFlay253: playing on EU?
[6:12:09] asfjordy: best prot paladins legendries?
[6:12:11] Skylin3r: Luxthos has great auras for all specs
[6:12:15] Tubflow: I have been blating torghast on my 149 boomy
[6:12:17] spizzoo: how is it on healers?
[6:12:17] PokerFaceMoose: on boomkin i just got the entangling roots powers and let that afk kill them
[6:12:18] PracTlKaL: If you balance affinity it's pretty easy as crit chicken
[6:12:21] Tubflow: blasting*
[6:12:21] Vigi9413: Have people actually gotten loot from wrath of the jailer?
[6:12:24] PvtHudson093: yubi yubi
[6:12:24] Xunadin: Sever list is up
[6:12:25] Shayuki: @Leonidus7 Interesting, I had to use the 1.5min invulnerability to kill Maw of the Maw and still needed even 30s after
[6:12:25] chrslp: They need to buff the shit out of Shadow Priests in Torghast. Literally impossible to solo level 3s as s priest and level 2 is even difficult
[6:12:25] PracTlKaL: sory resto*
[6:12:25] Skylin3r: i wasn't able to beat T3 on BM hunter
[6:12:32] Kisswani: it's pretty comfortable on my luck
[6:12:38] Qargory: torgast is rough as dps, cant get passed layer 2 so far
[6:12:38] Kisswani: lock *
[6:12:39] Vivelli: just be a mage and 1 shot the boss
[6:12:41] mi3f: yeah some bosses are pretty difficult on certain dps classes
[6:12:42] CrunkyBrewster: @seitharyn oh no no i know its built in.. i mean whatever addon ppl are using to post rare locations in chat
[6:12:43] billybaroo1: is this the beta server?
[6:12:43] TheGreasyMallard: my rogue buddies and a few other dps cant do any l3s and I just laughed as a prot pally
[6:12:44] Skylin3r: those tentacle Eyes man
[6:12:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: I got geared and managed to beat both tier, week 1 was rough AF though
[6:12:52] Vigi9413: Chat he's on EU

[6:13:08] PracTlKaL: looks dope af
[6:13:08] Skylin3r: weak 1 was actually easy on BM hunter
[6:13:12] Leonidus7: @Shayuki Like I said if you get decent RNG with anima powers you should be ok. Those two runs were made easy by powers. Priest can make a clone with fade and frost just kites
[6:13:13] Crypto_IX: whats raid content is soloable for tmogs now? Legion?
[6:13:23] L1quidkurage496: is the idea for dps in torghast at lvl 3 to group up ?
[6:13:27] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee That potion is not just for Bastion, you should see other areas, its epic
[6:13:27] PracTlKaL: Are they still adding controller support?
[6:13:28] Skylin3r: week 2 had to settle on T2's
[6:13:30] MarshallOnline: its hard af on rogue lmao this one boss spawned these adds that use this soul beam on you and did ton of damage and he kept spawning more and more
[6:13:48] Meddok: hey what made you change to kyrian?

[6:13:53] Kisswani: I think they got the tuning right for Torghast
[6:13:54] BearOfLight: Maw of the Maw is a monster, glad I learned that he deals more damage based on how many Powers you have
[6:13:58] Chrysophylax_I: @marshall_online You kill the ads?
[6:13:59] bionic_kn1ght: I was super happy to down the Maw of the Maw with my shaman!
[6:14:03] Vigi9413: alright let's all pray for loot from jailer event, and loot from the world boss
[6:14:03] aumixp: What boss is it in torghast wing that was up this week that looks like a dog and summoned some mobs?
[6:14:04] chrslp: Your ability to finish Torghast shouldnt depend on Anima power RNG
[6:14:07] billybaroo1: you can invis so much with a mage. i got to 3 solo
[6:14:08] Shayuki: @Leonidus7 I play melee so yeah kiting not really an option.
[6:14:10] Outbreak815: on my enhance shaman i go like 80% defensive powers and 20% offense.
[6:14:13] rdm_games: Can we see the mic?
[6:14:15] CrunkyBrewster: true
[6:14:21] PracTlKaL: All single target is what you want imo
[6:14:21] Ballavar: being a bear, and knowing how to use all the the skills available to druids is just not fair. it makes me not want to help my guildies because of the giant difference in the difficulties
[6:14:24] Vigi9413: the trash fucks me
[6:14:25] Leonidus7: @Shayuki What do you play? Yea that is a yikes from me bud lol
[6:14:31] Whytepap3r: That's probably a better mindset. Sometimes you get fcked with the RNG and you get a bunch of Steward buffs.
[6:14:42] Shayuki: @Leonidus7 I play Unholy Death Knight
[6:14:43] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: But muh trash parses in Torghast! towCry @Towelliee
[6:14:46] TarMonA: spice of life for the win
[6:14:55] Varteras: Not to mention some of the enemies in Torghast you want to nuke down as quickly as possible
[6:15:02] Kromede: and than

[6:15:46] BuddySinister: coxBaeloy
[6:15:49] seitharyn: @CrunkuTV Hmm i'm not sure of a specific addon for that, but HandyNotes will put little skull icons on your map to show you where rares are, and then you can set a pin and shift+click it into chat
[6:15:56] ssjw1337: Is it vape proof?
[6:15:57] zorah_illustrations: that is a sexy microphone lol
[6:15:58] skeLEXtor: If that base had a way to mount the shock mount on it, it would be 100% better!!!!
[6:15:58] Ballavar: what?! thats epic!
[6:15:59] Pigeon_Pounder: wonder what comes up if you type "yeti porn" in google

[6:32:40] FluffyRampage69: There s also a blood test where they take your blood
[6:32:41] shagbark_: no blood, just stick a q-tip like 1.5 inches up your shnozz
[6:32:42] Eastwicksavag3: my test was only on my nostrillss

[7:51:26] bmike: China will be winners this tier hehe.
[7:51:34] zeeAbe: Top guilds wipe a fuckton because they try to push with the gear they have. They do not have the luxury of endlessly farming loot so they can beat the boss.
[7:51:36] zminny: I like to be frustrated on like 3/10 bosses that make me feel like I accomplished something when I beat them but not so hard that I am stuck on one boss for weeks like that is the sweet spot
[7:51:43] AshhTones: plus they have a lot of highly proficient players for pretty much all the different specs to be able to adjust for each fight

[8:24:05] arcanostic: I hated Awakening. Did not play to my strengths. Really held me back in keys.
[8:24:07] letrickyxd: Rogues were so important in BFA, Awakened alleviated that issue a lot
[8:24:11] mayonaes: every 20% one spawns
[8:24:19] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee Yeah, I think there's an issue with resubs. If you put in anything OTHER than the emote, you don't get the corresponding banner display on stream. Lot of people are bringing it up and the common denominator, they put the emote and then resub text.
[8:24:35] Dcarter: we got all week im good with it lol

[8:36:24] duncon: for me BFA was the first xpac where I was able to raid all the way through. also the first xpac where i leveling mroe than 1 alt. so i'd say it was a success.
[8:36:36] MagentaPikachu: theres a point where you keep adding to classic and it stops being classic
[8:36:37] Abbz44: Nostalgia can only go so far. Because that's all it is, Nostalgia
[8:36:38] sentorack: how you on wow? says my servers are down?
[8:36:38] Kyrrua: why act like classic stops, when only 200 guilds did naxx ?? I mean its the same as the progress when 1% does it and people say the content is done

[8:37:14] pavepawns: fckin hell thats fast @PLAGUEDxHAVOC
[8:37:17] Molvonos: @Kyrrua Because it does. It has an end-point. Retail will continue as long as the game goes on, but 'classic' ends with Naxxramas.
[8:37:17] neverbornlucky: the BFA Horde story line was so much better then the alliance. I was one who played wow before it was called classic but actual wow only quit during legion
[8:37:19] mavericks312: chiefs and colts are the only legit teams in the afc
[8:37:21] DrakhanGaming: shadowlands>legion>MoP>WoD>BC>Wrath>Vanilla>BFA>classic>cata

[8:37:58] Vigi9413: @drakhangaming not ready to put shadowlands ober legion yet
[8:38:00] peallatwitch: @DrakhanGaming WoD was good at launch too, you cant say its the best expac after 2 weeks FailFish

[8:38:38] dirtyoldgrandpa024: derrick henry trampled colts though 2nd time
[8:38:40] DrakhanGaming: I dont need to grind AP so SL is over Legion all day
[8:38:41] mavericks312: i dont think anyone is taking the browns serious and the steelers arent as great as that 11-0 record
[8:38:42] TheBeardedSpider: go back

[8:39:20] thewillem: Could be worse. I'm a Seahawks fan. We just lost to the Giants and did absolutely nothing on offense. So much for the MVP.
[8:39:21] joshball217: I'm a Bears fan but holy fuck they're awful

[8:41:18] im_n0t_jezus: he knows
[8:41:21] Molvonos: I'm an Oilers fan.
[8:41:26] Kyrrua: that's different subject. tbc getting out can be considered new content or old content depending on the player. for me classic was new content
[8:41:33] dareetv: Im an only fan.
[8:41:57] Buckwink: at least the Jets will have a real quarterback next year
[8:41:59] TarMonA: from 53 mins ago the twitted saying to be 3 hour from then.. so 2 hour from now
[8:42:02] Molvonos: @Kyrrua That's not fact, that's just your opinion. It's not new. It's rehashed from 15+ years ago. Just because you didn't play it back then doesn't magically make it 'new'.
[8:42:02] Totemkatsu: im an towOny fan
[8:42:06] Kyrrua: I just think this whole discussion makes no sense about new content being all that matters

[8:42:28] Slitze: this is the servers are coming up thoon piss.. i better take mine
[8:42:29] BlackAngelxD: cause they're no pvp severs no more
[8:42:35] peallatwitch: @Molvonos And Shadowlands WQ's, Dungeons, Raids are also rehashed content FailFish
[8:42:46] BlackAngelxD: they're all Normal or RP pretty much the samething . .
[8:42:50] mmrghost7: servers are up u just have to smoke more
[8:42:52] Molvonos: @peallatwitch That... is idiotic, yo.
[8:42:53] weirdsp4ce: so the game isn't up?
[8:42:56] Kyrrua: @Molvonos ok classic isnt new contet and it isnt a surprised for everyone, so what ?
[8:42:58] Ryondious: will realm list update real time or do I need to keep exiting and relogging in?
[8:43:03] Anderus00: @slitze Tow knows! he says he doesnt, but he does
[8:43:10] Buckwink: @Vigi9413 he wont get the chance to ruin Trevor Lawrence

[8:43:36] ankregs: real time ryondious
[8:43:37] Kyrrua: except saying "classic isnt new content"
[8:43:44] HavocWolf11B: @kevstirrr 2
[8:43:48] BlackAngelxD: cause classic isn't
[8:43:51] kevstirrr: Kk thanks
[8:43:53] hunterxp: lmao

[9:48:12] Klarynse: Cheer100 Cheer100

[9:48:33] Exoduc: @Towelliee are we going to get kyrian/fae/nath'rezim/bone wings as mounts this expansion? y/n
[9:48:34] Rictamar: Blizz employs Lore just to liason with content creators, that is his job
[9:48:38] ronnyone: the game has been around for nearly twenty years how much more exposure could it possibly need
[9:48:39] jbandz41: Nintendo only did that cause the person had a Pokémon name
[9:48:43] dareetv: I'd like to think it's a little symbiotic because content creators are free advertisement for blizzard. companies ALWAYS need adverts.
[9:48:55] Ribbwich: @Gylduran yea coz he used to be one too
[9:48:58] DrakhanGaming: Casters?
[9:49:04] wraaith: in ur case it would just be free money lmao

[9:50:10] xmiazma: yea cause half the people here are hopping off to play lol
[9:50:11] SirShooks: ofc, thats logical. when the game is down, people cant play, and so they come here to chat. when the servers are up, they go to actually play the game.

[10:05:40] R2RHIN0: There will never be another game like WoW.
[10:05:40] soysos91: @Towelliee you think covid helped SL sales? with ppl having to be at home
[10:05:43] Gr8White26: gr8whiTeLove
[10:05:44] metavahn231: battle for islands
[10:05:50] rutpie: wrong
[10:05:51] PhaseDwarf: @Towelliee What tanks are you gonna be running for the raid?
[10:05:53] gr8fuld3ad: #wodwasgreat
[10:05:54] wild_corndogs: This expansion to me ranks up there with BC and WotLK
[10:05:57] ZinZog: @Towelliee can you sound like a murloc with your new mic?
[10:05:57] Squidnapped: I loved it outside of corruption
[10:06:00] merevin: if maw would be weekly would be better
[10:06:01] rutpie: not better than legion
[10:06:07] KonradGM: people played a lot of bfa, i just dont think they enojyed it
[10:06:07] biscuitness: .... I liked BFA. And the Zones were top tier (Shadowlands doesn't come close to the collection of zones from BFA)
[10:06:07] Cheapesttactics1: how are warrior tanks?
[10:06:09] jimthemanc: I loved in Legion
[10:06:12] Deadsmoke96: legion is my favorite of the more recent expansions, aside from shadowlands
[10:06:12] Dave_Growl: Its legion 2.0
[10:06:14] CashinitGaming: WoD and Cata were the slums of wow expacs imo
[10:06:14] mainetrev: Ayyy happy 40th! @towelliee
[10:06:22] Ballavar: we do know they have an "A" team and a "B" team, it seems the whatever team makes legion and shadowlands are the "A" team haha
[10:06:24] kurlook: Meh, servers still down.
[10:06:24] iDazidan: warrior tanks LUL
[10:06:25] Gapz: @cubertin yeah, im def autistic
[10:06:32] Glucian: I chose Kyrian for my frost mage. Do I switch after 2 weeks, level another mage to go Venthyr, or uninstall the game?
[10:06:35] Deathkanigit101: ever slap something so hard you hurt your hands and joints.
[10:06:36] peallatwitch: its to early to rate Shadowlands. It can turn out to be complete shit in 2 months
[10:06:39] itsbinkgamingtv: @Towelliee happy 40th
[10:06:44] Squidnapped: legion legendary was horrible. I remember getting all of mine the lsat one i got was the one i needed XD
[10:06:46] mainetrev: New mic?
[10:06:48] Skylin3r: or getting legendary in vasnilla/tbc
[10:06:48] merevin: what time is the alt raid ?
[10:06:48] ArcaneMaki: RIP Ysera
[10:06:48] shinyyraichu: really not happy with how the new legendaries function though. Legendaries should be like BC ones or the trinket from Argus.. have them be soooo friggin rare.
[10:06:49] wild_corndogs: I played from Vanilla to WotLK, took a break and came back for BFA (which i HATED)
[10:06:59] kay4964: @Towelliee do the orc sound with new mic?\
[10:07:04] Sonatta: there was sooooo much to do in BFA
[10:07:06] modifiedgrapes: agreed
[10:07:07] neverbornlucky: Towelliee how much you want to bet that the WOW dev's are betting on how long they can keep servers down just to see us all wait around doing nothing for the servers
[10:07:08] Supers18: too much mandatory
[10:07:08] biscuitness: BFA had a ton to do
[10:07:09] Sammael_Darksbane: I enjoyed BfA a ton
[10:07:11] axxowow: we need to fpfate addons today @Towelliee ?
[10:07:17] Tyrandian: And all those systems were basically required.
[10:07:18] axxowow: update*
[10:07:18] Sonatta: people just didn't want to do what BFA was cooking
[10:07:27] Austei: was tough coming back to bfa so i just waited for shadowlands myself
[10:07:30] peallatwitch: Cata sucks, Mop good, Wod sucks, Legion good, Bfa shit, Shadowlands good
[10:07:33] biscuitness: BFA's tail was a bit long between the last major updates and Shadowlands, but that's circumstantial.
[10:07:34] OldHerk: i agree there were alot of systems that were just weirdly disconnected imo as a player who doesnt get to play much
[10:07:38] peallatwitch: definitely a cycle
[10:07:42] VuziieX: How long till us servers are up do u know?
[10:07:43] Wcvechten: Now, if ALL the content was good in BFA, it would've been a S+ tier expansion
[10:07:45] thebakeriscomingforu: pours one out for twilight devestation
[10:07:45] Nelinde: the constant daily grind wore me out as everything was locked behind the rep grind with WQ's and actually drove me away for 6 months. When I came back things had changed for the better and I loved it again <3
[10:07:46] Ballavar: i would say im salty about bfa as i DIDNT have the time. so when i did get time. i was a punching bag to conten
[10:07:48] Stars_Eternall: i miss having so much to do tbh
[10:07:49] DasWhip: What boss are you most excited for?
[10:07:50] littlesack: what's your /played on your main @Towelliee ?
[10:07:51] dinerbr: i prefered legion
[10:07:52] oTurista: is necrolord good for guardian druid?
[10:08:00] iDazidan: I thought legion was great
[10:08:02] jbmoongirl: BFA was ok, I enjoyed a lot of the content, it just went way too long....wasn’t fond of the last patch as much though
[10:08:03] Sonatta: crying about Pathfinder LUL
[10:08:04] geozero: because you had to invest time in BFA to stay ahead. it was awful
[10:08:04] spidyor: had my bday nov 12 ..60 yrs old next me lol LUL LUL
[10:08:07] xvstormvx: Cheer100
[10:08:09] owVanish: was corruption a horrible idea
[10:08:12] kurlook: I spent most of BFA deployed and my wifi was trash.. I just gave up trying lol
[10:08:14] N3_Destro: lol I loved corruption guess my main lol
[10:08:20] peallatwitch: Artifact weapon was so good with all the skins you could collect, they shhould do something like it again
[10:08:21] Gapz: @Towelliee Remember when they had to buff the mana regen of Destros because of all the haste they had make them go OOM?
[10:08:26] Dave_Growl: twight devistation Kreygasm
[10:08:26] jak_gaming: UGH TD RANK 3 x2
[10:08:27] talic420: BFA had way to much for a player that can't play 8hrs a day
[10:08:28] doomester: @Towelliee me, i hated TD as a tank
[10:08:31] Di3r0: Literally everyone i know hated it so i guess its just preference.
[10:08:31] CashinitGaming: ccorruption was the worst for game balance but was fun af
[10:08:34] SlimZz_TV: I mean we have to remember these games arent meant to be played 365 24/7 lol not healthy at all
[10:08:38] drfarringt0n: Shadowlands seems so intimidating early on with all the "currencies" to deal with. glad I am taking my time with it
[10:08:44] SlimZz_TV: there should be a point of pause
[10:08:47] saltychickenbiscuit: <Tank and hated TD. was stacking vers for 20's
[10:08:47] Chanluie: necro is great for bear

[10:10:10] propwash80: @Towelliee one of the problems BFA had was forcing ppl do content they didnt like in order to get the stuff for their neck piece, for example BIS neck ability for my class was unlocked through pvp, i never pvp, and when i tried it burned me out
[10:10:15] nightmayor12: could only complete layer 2

[16:53:07] parmas1: ty
[16:53:28] KardRedren: the difficulty looks like a huge step up from bfa normal raids
[16:53:30] parmas1: it looks tense for normal
[16:53:43] Zeuzo: its nice
[16:53:53] Ryok: well i wanted to answer someone else but i guess i answered 2 people at once ^^
[16:53:54] Zeuzo: finaly raids are not realy easy

[16:54:56] Ransrot: do you think the raid is overtuned
[16:55:09] Solid0Liquid: still can't log in :(
[16:55:09] FrankTizzle: @ransrot it’s the first day so no
[16:55:20] FrankTizzle: Asking for nerfs already is fucking insane
[16:55:53] K_Rok: tbh I wanted to raid this with my homies but seeing people struggle on normal makes me think that's gonna be tough
[16:55:53] Mez42: what's the minimum number of people for normal raid?
[16:55:56] PsychoTendency: Let people learn mechanics. lol
[16:56:04] FrankTizzle: 10 is min

[17:03:47] Holymoomo: IN THE MIDDLE OF A PULL
[17:04:17] snoo_32: it's not a big deal , if you don't want ads just sub. You can buy a 10$ google play or 10$ itunes and get a sub
[17:04:18] givmeafrekinname: @Morchokk You must've been away from Twitch for awhile. They implemented a new ad system. I've gotten upi to 11 ads in a row.
[17:04:48] Poisonblack44: Fucking commercials ruining my immersion ... time to sub
[17:05:04] Holymoomo: @jmg1988 dogshit system, cause no matter what, i still get 3-4 ads in a row even when the last time i was on was 5 hours ago
[17:05:21] givmeafrekinname: @Morchokk I completely agree.
[17:05:26] Noshpan: @jmg1988 Same. I've timed it & got 3 1/2 minutes worth of ads

[17:06:31] Holymoomo: @holyanimal99 cause you look at ads during commercials on television ? no cause they make an ad break at the right time
[17:06:46] Alohafromiowa: see if you can master ate and finish before adds end..I do great challenge

[17:07:15] chukudu: normal seems a bit overtuned :(
[17:07:39] Noshpan: @Morchokk They used to do it that way, but it wasn't generating enough revenue for their weed money
[17:07:41] undisputedmoe: Cam?
[17:07:51] K_Rok: Why is it harder with 10?
[17:08:06] ItsGlime: is story line or thread of fate better for 2nd char/
[17:08:15] Holymoomo: @Noshpan i guess so, still stupid and senseless from them to do such a system
[17:08:21] Archiee: @Towelliee Happy Birthday you beautiful tank bastard, you! I'm out for the night but just wanted to wish you the best man! Love the streams and looking forward to what is yet to come!

[17:13:58] ItsGlime: @K_Rok think mains want to run heroic first, so they can trade normal loot or something like that
[17:14:00] grimxav: why do all runs first?
[17:14:14] duhworks: the hungering destroyer need a hp nerf it was a 9 min fight for my guild

[17:14:23] blrwllm: is this the first alt run ?
[17:14:44] Tsobes: It’s nice to see it’s not a breeze on normal. I think it’s more item level them mechanics with the raid though

[17:19:29] Atrosity: chat, as a new tank. if you had to choose between DH or Prot pally which would you do for shadowlands?
[17:20:03] NeoWokeio: prot paladin is very beginner friendly
[17:20:26] Artivicii: @Atrosity prot pally, although you wont regret going DH if you like m+
[17:20:28] tdpark_: and this is normal?
[17:20:30] parmas1: prot pala bro
[17:20:45] Edump: quinn wiped 24 times on this lol
[17:20:46] parmas1: he is doing the same damage as dps
[17:20:47] Atrosity: im mainly a m+ kinda guy, never tanked a raid so i'm too scared to
[17:20:55] snoo_32: do you think prot pally is more tanky than brew for this fight ?
[17:21:00] Artivicii: @Atrosity prot pally is second to Dh tho, very close second
[17:21:19] Atrosity: @Artivicii maybe prot pally to learn the tank roll a bit, then veng DH later?
[17:21:25] jxakari: wow raids are toxic ngl LUL
[17:21:26] gfield2k: is there a world first yet ?
[17:21:38] Artivicii: @Atrosity sure, but youll probably just stay with prot lol
[17:21:42] NOS_4EVR: its a dps race once all those pillars are gone
[17:21:47] Artivicii: @Atrosity its fun
[17:21:49] upperdeckerdean: my guild only killed 2 bosses :)
[17:21:57] DragonofWolves: well if people aren't listening then yeah RL is going to be mad

[17:22:19] upperdeckerdean: i dont feel grateful
[17:22:31] upperdeckerdean: i feel like it was a clown show lol
[17:23:18] K_Rok: I think it could be toxic but this group is pretty respectful
[17:23:27] blrwllm: the expansion had sold over 3.7 million copies
[17:23:34] blrwllm: did anyone else see that ?
[17:23:35] Tsobes: It’s what happens when devs made normal raids super easy for years people just assume it’s gonna be easy and get frustrated quicker
[17:23:49] KardRedren: do tanks get chained?
[17:24:07] Euboxic: if anyone having issue logging in - copy working friends wow/_retail_/cache directory to your wow directory
[17:24:21] Jigsawzz: @blrwllm don't all the xpac pretty much sell over 3m?
[17:25:02] zennythought: @Jigsawzz Only one that didn't was Mists of Pandatown
[17:25:27] Tsobes: Gonna be interesting to see how cyberpunk sells this week compared to wow
[17:25:27] Jigsawzz: ah kung flu pandas were rejected by the playerbase it seems
[17:26:15] upperdeckerdean: @Jigsawzz atpBigot
[17:26:27] L33TInTheBoat: i ate 75mg edibles and played in Ardenweald. Best decision.
[17:26:34] futilewarrior: monkaS
[17:26:39] Vigi9413: hey chat how's the raid looking
[17:27:02] Jigsawzz: @Vigi9413 toxic
[17:27:10] Zinchii: Is this norm or heroic
[17:27:23] K_Rok: lol @L33TInTheBoat I'm happy for you
[17:27:26] artois: @Vigi9413 just wiped to heroic shriekwing for two hours
[17:27:56] thardem: it's normal
[17:28:01] zennythought: This one is looking closest
[17:28:21] zennythought: All the cooldowns.
[17:28:44] K_Rok: What if everyone blows personals before the pillar so healers can do some damage?
[17:28:49] Plutie: they can do it
[17:28:59] Beeeftw: normal vor hc
[17:29:13] Majedawa: What is that left side timer addon ?
[17:29:13] Jigsawzz: d-e-d
[17:29:19] bettersnekos: @Towelliee how many hours do you think this whole raid will take to complete?
[17:29:26] thardem: Cooldowns
[17:29:28] griffdog125: you all need a sham healer in there <<<
[17:29:42] Ardailec: D: Is that release from body animation based on the covenant?
[17:29:50] Ardailec: Every time I've seen it it was red.
[17:30:01] mrniceguy817: @majed_aw Exorsus idk the spelling
[17:30:02] Jigsawzz: @boomeranng125 so you can drop healing stream totem while you cast frost shock!

[17:31:47] Dcarter: no normal
[17:31:50] Dcarter: and its apure alt run
[17:31:50] PaPaBeaRCA: oh
[17:31:52] Dcarter: pure*

[17:31:59] ascended696: "meaningful choices" xD
[17:32:01] andreastb: just look at the title :)
[17:32:02] pavepawns: Dcarter kill it for us
[17:32:03] Holymoomo: 10-15 min CD would make more sense
[17:32:05] raisw: I heard HC is a bit overtuned?
[17:32:08] Eggsally: is normal too hard? opinions?
[17:32:09] thardem: still raid looks ultra hard compared to bfa raids
[17:32:10] Ballsonfire_: you guys think its a bit overtuned for normal people ?
[17:32:19] Dcarter: meh its fun
[17:32:22] SeckSymbols: Raid is a bit difficult, yeah
[17:32:24] L33TInTheBoat: damn I went to play on a different computer and now I can't login to wow
[17:32:30] Nomad_Manny: Happy Bday Homie !
[17:32:31] alex12645: one people use them to troll goldshire and it dose 17% damge
[17:32:35] realBaldBandit: Raiding exp launch is so fun to watch
[17:32:39] snoo_32: maybe they are trying to go back to catacylsm roots LUL
[17:32:39] Eggsally: seems to be the consensus
[17:32:46] warrenny: Even nyalotha?
[17:32:48] Ardailec: I mean. At least it's not like Emerald Nightmare?
[17:32:55] Xenocide321: This is a good thing
[17:32:56] Ballsonfire_: i just hate that my legos are locked behind hard bosses ..need to invest alot of time
[17:32:57] Chris_127: this boss seems to be a wall
[17:32:59] Dragneelessar: not for uldir but
[17:33:00] Maximum: Happy birthday big man
[17:33:02] PaPaBeaRCA: its a great thing
[17:33:03] Dinermoe: wait is this normal?
[17:33:07] Zeuzo: get gud or get wrekt
[17:33:07] Jigsawzz: maybe you guys are getting old and losing the edge Kappa
[17:33:08] Kinghorn: max!
[17:33:10] Edump: QUinn wiped 24 times
[17:33:11] pavepawns: its normal diff
[17:33:14] d3trak: raids supposed to be easy?
[17:33:21] Solid0Liquid: raids are supposed to be hard right?
[17:33:23] DragonofWolves: maaaaaaax
[17:33:25] SeckSymbols: @d3trak I dont think anyone said that?
[17:33:28] Edump: yup
[17:33:28] realBaldBandit: Imagine mythic hah?

[17:33:29] zennythought: Yup
[17:33:29] YardRage: F
[17:33:33] SeckSymbols: People are just mentioning that they are difficult
[17:33:34] DrDraePhD: yah

[17:33:45] Aravarth: Aravarth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[17:33:46] Mcbeave: Huntsman hitting my monk for 110k on heroic is...
[17:33:47] d3trak: dont answer a question with a question @Secksymbols
[17:33:48] zennythought: They did fine before this boss, then they did fine after this boss.
[17:33:48] Edump: After this boss the next two are super easy
[17:33:48] killawatts75: i like a harder difficulty
[17:33:53] pavepawns: max is watching ye stream :o
[17:33:59] SeckSymbols: @d3trak I will and I just did, get over it
[17:34:06] PaPaBeaRCA: @towelliee maybe its the fact that its been almost one year before this new raid people are rusty
[17:34:10] zennythought: It was really only this boss that caused ridiculous number of wipes and little changes. They just threw every amount of DPS they could.
[17:34:11] Xenocide321: well this boss was the weakest in beta and it got buffed
[17:34:15] d3trak: thanks for helping
[17:34:19] Belirs: KEKW
[17:34:24] Mellamojay: Any updates on the login issues?
[17:34:26] thardem: well, i think it's ok if normal is a bit harder. BUT... if mythic is as much harder, i dislike it. Even in BFA mythic was too hard for most, they did never fill up the hall of fame in time. I know some guilds were rockin through, but...
[17:34:32] Edump: yueah quinn died 24 times to this boss nexs two boss are one shots
[17:34:44] Ballsonfire_: Its fun unless your bis legendary is on the last boss and you dont have time

[17:35:37] thardem: no
[17:35:41] snoo_32: i rmemeber a bunch of expacs back, you had to farm normal a few weeks to get geared for full on farm mode, then climb to heroic and repeat
[17:35:56] snoo_32: they really made normal easy in Legion and BFA imo
[17:35:59] realBaldBandit: Yeah @holyanimal99
[17:36:00] YardRage: Kreygasm
[17:36:01] thardem: Best is 5/10 in HC
[17:36:11] Whytepap3r: Look at that river of pain flowing into him
[17:36:13] Teege2: I can't beat the DC boss towSalt
[17:36:17] zennythought: I think you guys are a little shallow on DPS.
[17:36:27] Tankape: @thardem honestly BFA mythic was mostly on the easier side of things, except some bosses (notably the end bosses and a few others)
[17:36:36] Ardailec: Is Sludgefist this raid's Patchwerk?
[17:36:47] realBaldBandit: Who is toweliee raiding with now?
[17:36:51] DarkPsyanide: @Teege2 i'm having the same issue can't get in
[17:37:17] snoo_32: i think mythic BFA nyloth was so easy because we had tons of enhancements abilities, passives, and other powerful junk to beat it @Tankape
[17:37:26] DatDoubleB: Same won’t let me log in or even sit in que and wait
[17:37:39] Burshu: dafuq is that URL?
[17:37:44] realBaldBandit: Is it still sparty’s guild?

[17:38:16] Solid0Liquid: @Dinermoe i still can't log in :(
[17:38:21] excessior: tihnk normal bit overtuned
[17:38:23] thardem: @Tankape I really think that is because of consistent good guilds playing, and having really good knowledge of the raid before live release. Hall of fame did not fill. It was "easy" end of 8.3, but definitly not in the beginning.
[17:38:31] Supers18: this normal? thought this would just fall over
[17:38:32] Dinermoe: @setupcrust holy shit, really?

[18:20:46] K_Rok: I missed the sludgefist kill :(
[18:21:07] zinbers: This tier is no joke it going to be hard for the next 2-3 weeks but will get easier as you do mythic plus and get better gear
[18:21:16] realBaldBandit: They killed sludge with a one shot easy @k_rok
[18:22:57] realBaldBandit: Feels like a blood prince fight amirite?
[18:23:14] thardem: @zinbers with only one piece of gear dropping in the end of dungeon box, this will get difficult for everyone with a full time job. I heavily dislike this, as I might not find the time to do 5+ dungeons a day.
[18:24:03] Belirs: this fight looks so undertuned
[18:24:08] Belirs: compared to sludgefist
[18:24:09] zinbers: I have a full time job to
[18:24:20] realBaldBandit: Rocks = bad
[18:24:33] ThommHS: @Belirs wait till they reach 3rd phase 4Head
[18:24:39] Daggerstry: Anyone seen Sloot? Was expecting him to be on too
[18:24:48] zinbers: It going to take a while to grind gear this is the classic wow way of gearing
[18:24:49] thardem: Yeah well... expect to run lots of m+ ;-)
[18:25:02] thardem: no, it is not.
[18:25:17] asbringers: thardem u can take ur time u don't run first world
[18:25:28] zinbers: You might get use to how this will be this is the new Norma
[18:25:35] thardem: true - but I still want to give my very best.

[18:26:02] SorionTheGinger: @asbringers problem with taking your time when you're not in a guild is: "jay, week 2 lets find a rai .. what do you mean i need curve!!!!"
[18:26:31] thardem: The thing is - in classic loot is interesting because the items are different and partly, very, very good. With m+ you have the item like in 5 different ilvl iterations, it's always the same. And basicly on m+15 loot matters.
[18:26:35] zinbers: This is going to be a pug killer
[18:26:43] asbringers: SorionZ true
[18:26:54] jasperboy: @zinbers pugs wont even get past sludge LUL
[18:27:05] Coviori: Are those 2 Holy Priest Main Holy or Diszi?

[18:28:25] xheero: We struggled a lot tonight. This makes me feel better
