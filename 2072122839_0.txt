[0:15:15] cthulhuhs123: How much did you COD it for
[0:15:29] zickiwow: Redirect no longer triggers or is affected by the global cooldown, and its own cooldown has been reduced to 10 seconds. Developers’ notes: when Redirect is combined in a macro with other Combo Point related abilities, it often does not function as expected. We recommend not including it in such macros.
[0:15:51] zickiwow: maybe i put it on my bar

[0:50:32] Distressed: As long as the streamer doesnt make enough money to become a local warlord, should be fine.
[0:50:53] Thayir: I mean you both win but US wins more because you’re bringing more money to US (twitch) and they’re paying you a fraction of what you made to them (e.g. via ads, subs)

[1:31:29] medskie: there is plenty of grass-fed beef in the US tho
[1:31:44] therealthracian: hormone injection + corn fed
[1:31:47] HeinMuck: because Grains have carbs
[1:31:53] Silkjet001: @Lrlol i understand what u mean but if the package says 100% grass fed, then its 100% grassfed. are you implying the business is lying to customers?
[1:31:55] ZetItUp: we only fed them grain/wheat during the winter half year

[1:32:51] wizz_z: @PsheroTV why sinister strike instead of 2% dodge in talents?
[1:32:56] slippinjimmmyy: cause when you eat meat, especially the fat from the meat, your technically eating what the animal ate. animals fed a shitty diet tend to be more omega 6s instead of omega 3s.
[1:33:01] triggs390: @wizz_z quick draw
[1:33:09] Lrlol: corn fed steaks are bad for humans, should always get grass fed
[1:33:11] furiousee: The worst hormone injection, GMO or bad diets will do to the meat is give it poor nutritional value relative to better quality meats. That's not poison lol

[1:34:32] Kronblom1: grass fed is much more expensive with pretty much exact same nutrients i do not bother

[1:35:10] CarboN__: thats insane to think the cow suddenly turns into corn when it eats corn. wtf are you talking about.  there is zero difference between a corn fed cow and a grass fed cow.  GRASS FED BEED IS LEANER. thats it. so you cut off the extra fat and u have the exact same meat.

[1:36:21] ACTpohabta: nope it cannot be bad for you. genetic modification does not affect digestion. the chemicals ( herbicides ) can be a problem tho
