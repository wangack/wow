[1:01:12] ThisIsBrutus: wonder if i should sacrifice more for health
[1:01:29] Locktapuss: funny I was just thinking about penance, didn't realise it was so good... leveling as shadow spec was not the move
[1:01:49] abrlol_: @Hydramist How much more rep do you get from flag caps in wsg weekend? do you know?

[1:12:52] ThisIsBrutus: @Hydramist 3pc gnomer + speed on boots, or 2pc + arathi boots with stam? That proc just seems too good to pass up on.
[1:13:18] ThisIsBrutus: guess that makes sense lol

[1:22:41] Selecktt: Eh. Im in two minds about it. On one hand, I like more alts. On the other, I really dont think they should take the rush to 60 approach retail has.
[1:23:28] Selecktt: Imo they should give that exp buff to quests, rather than blanket exp gains. Incentivises more people out in the open world rather than SM grinding.

[1:24:20] Mumples: classic lvling experience is awful so im all for it
[1:24:41] moonweaverx: think its just going to be faster dung grinds lol
[1:24:59] Skry667: classic leveling is great if you have players to level with.
[1:25:32] eza1337: ye i had fun with 4 friends grinding to 40, but dungeon spam with rnd can be very aids
[1:25:40] Skry667: when the bulk of people hit the cap its hard finding groups and thats when it sucks.
[1:25:41] Mumples: can't say I agree
[1:25:46] Mumples: just get me to max lvl asap
[1:26:33] Selecktt: This is probably way outside the scope of SOD, and much more in the Classic+ camp. But I hate the rush to max level notion. Make the leveling less bad instead, but keep it a core part of the game.

[1:27:14] eza1337: ye its super chill
[1:27:33] kinioce: bro nobodies gonna play if it takes 1 week to get to lvl 25
[1:27:43] kinioce: for an alt
[1:27:55] kinioce: if every1 is having fun at 40
[1:28:11] azzepted: how in the living hell does it take ppl 1week to get to lvl 25. even in classic that was about 2days :P
[1:28:24] Mumples: for me the game is at whatever the max level is, long tedious leveling grinds aren't fun
[1:28:27] FiberZ_: I really like the feel of everyone being stopped at 40 and chillin for a bit its nice
[1:28:40] eza1337: 12hours playtime are 1 week of playing for some ppl
[1:28:43] Selecktt: I dunno man. My best memories of the game, and even made some new ones in sod was shit that happened while leveling. Recently did the maelstrom weapon quest 8 levels underleveled with a bunch of other underleveled shamans. Tons of fun strategizing how to kill the 38 elite as a group of 30s.
[1:29:08] Mumples: wpvp while lvling is fun that's about it for me
[1:29:29] azzepted: @eza1337 i get that but we cant build a game around dad gamers that have 12hours to play a week:P
[1:29:44] eza1337: its actually season of dads bro
[1:30:07] Locktapuss: yeah it actually is haha
[1:30:14] Mumples: @azzepted what do u think the majority of the playerbase bro, it's casual players not try hards
[1:30:24] Mumples: is*
[1:30:32] eza1337: ye most are in their 30-40s playin sod
[1:30:35] eza1337: most are actual dads
[1:31:02] FiberZ_: eh idk i feel like everyone is playing it
[1:31:22] DeathToad007: thier numbers were tanking. thats why they rushed this out
[1:31:49] Vetto_7: what will you do on main when you got all the rep? still spam bgs?
[1:32:16] Mumples: @DeathToad007 wym rushed it out lol
[1:32:22] Mumples: it's best cntent they're done in years
[1:32:22] azzepted: thats my issue now having to farm the same stuff over and over again, not much to do exept making alts:P
[1:32:33] Mumples: they've *
[1:32:33] FiberZ_: I think people are just scared of 60 boosts and fast leveling like in retail LUL
[1:32:35] Mumples: i can't spell today
[1:32:39] Locktapuss: yeah it's gunna be awesome for leveling an alt
[1:32:51] squeakymcge: This song is a banger
[1:33:00] Selecktt: @FiberZ_ tbf is a well founded fear. They did it to wotlk classic. Complete with wow tokens.
[1:33:05] Kiroxx: 3 month aniversary, can u lvl fking EU soon
[1:33:07] FiberZ_: yeah 100%
[1:33:08] Kiroxx: ty
[1:33:25] Mumples: I doubt they'll add a boost to sod but u never know with blizz tbh
[1:33:41] Vetto_7: They should add, that if you have one char max lvl. you get 100% boost
[1:33:51] Vetto_7: so you can level alts fast
[1:33:52] FiberZ_: no its 100% a good fear to have but speeding up classic leveling a bit in sod isnt boosts so I think we good for now lol
[1:34:01] azzepted: give horde paladins and alliance shamans. :D
[1:34:14] Omgezzz: nice, a druid in my wsg find a spot with flag outside map :P hope players like that be banned hehe
[1:34:56] Selecktt: Yeah I mean I see the merit of it. But at the same time, we're getting DANGEROUSLY close to just paid level boosts. Which blizzard really loves to add in every version.
[1:35:10] Theodwin91: with so manny difrent runes, u think they will be able to balance classes at the end?
[1:35:40] nebula10: how many silver you got
[1:36:17] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[1:36:20] FiberZ_: yeah if that gets added sod is as good as dead tbh @Selecktt
[1:36:25] Denzax: what race do i go for priest on ally?
[1:36:30] Mumples: @Selecktt not really, if anything them adding an xp boost would mean they'd less likely add an actual boost
[1:36:34] tolsee: hello. it's my first time playing wow, since everybody talks about it so im asking random people about there opinion on a topic of first character. so what do you think?
[1:36:34] DeathToad007: @Mumples they did it a month into the phase. they said in the post it was supposed to go 100% for lower bracket at a later time but they pushed it forward
[1:36:38] Kaekias: tried to make a lfg post in discord, botched the message, panicked. deleted it. now i have 6h cd xD today is not my day

[1:37:56] Jakovasaur_: can you show talents
[1:37:57] Selecktt: Nope. But the excuse they used for wotlk was "this is wotlk classic not wotlk. Boosts are fine now." They could very easily do the same excuse in sod. "This is season of discovery, not classic. Heres some boosts."
[1:38:01] Mumples: they said that it was going to be about that before sod even started

[1:38:27] DeathToad007: @Mumples bro read the post. they say they rushed it out in the literal post. you are arguing just to argue
[1:38:29] Kiroxx: or mop
[1:38:30] nebula10: there was recruit a friend boost thing
[1:38:35] HeyImArty: first character boost was during Siege of orgrimmar

[1:39:10] zickiwow: 30 min adds WTF????????? 󠀀

[5:00:10] Mumples: ye just need to know  when is safe for u to open
[5:00:18] Mumples: if ur the only melee in 1v5 ofc u gna die first
[5:00:33] Hexcellentx: @Ephixza oh that's a good one
[5:01:14] Ephixza: @Hexcellentx  good memories, at least for me
[5:01:52] voodoodrop: all this aoe all this chain cc all this burst .... AND STILL NO CLOAK OF SHADOWS @Mumples
[5:02:45] Mumples: rog is pretty op dno if u can complain >.<
[5:03:10] HeyImArty: Mutilate dmg is questionable atm
[5:03:12] HeyImArty: xd
[5:03:30] gratzitko: i kinda wish i lvld a boomy instead of sp, im having so much fun on my 34 boomy with eclipse right now
[5:03:55] drunkredpriest: Whats everyone's take on twisted faith vs. void plague? I miss void plague so much when I swap, even for juicier MB
[5:04:09] HeyImArty: @Mumples did some calcs, you are right about helm atm
[5:04:37] Alori_: HUH
[5:04:38] HeyImArty: WSG helm might overtake at endgame due to DR scaling with increased HP pools, esp if they keep the BG HP increase
[5:04:46] HeyImArty: but at current level, its not worth
[5:04:53] Mumples: ye
[5:04:54] Mumples: https://sixtyupgrades.com/sod/set/3hAXLNUrj1kG93Rc79FAmx
[5:04:58] Mumples: here's my fc set if u want it

[5:06:45] HeyImArty: DR scales so well as HP pools increase
[5:06:46] Mumples: maybe
[5:06:50] Mumples: depends on options
[5:06:55] HeyImArty: depends on what they put into the game
[5:07:07] HeyImArty: impossible to predict since its SoD
[5:07:07] Kreynz: i hope they add proper pvp gear at 60 with resilience with all the extra dmg
[5:07:08] Kaekias: i could use 1.6k coins :(
[5:07:26] gratzitko: @Hydramist have u played boomy yet its so fun
[5:07:36] Mumples: think I might sub soon and get 40
[5:07:43] voodoodrop: waa? you. died like 4 times whole event??

[5:07:53] voodoodrop: CHEESUZ
[5:08:01] HeyImArty: it's actually pretty insane atm
[5:08:18] Mumples: ye i played 39 fc dru
[5:08:22] Mumples: it was bis then also
[5:08:26] HeyImArty: using it atm, its so strong
[5:08:32] HeyImArty: The amount of rogues that get fucked by it
[5:08:34] Kaekias: transfer the coins to me <3
[5:08:37] prodigy_wow: Could save them for honor in the last week of p2
[5:08:39] Mumples: in heavy rogue games it's good yea

[5:10:14] motorika: duels
[5:10:17] Schweinerz: yo @Hydramist what addon to show enemy player buffs? is there still a way?
[5:10:19] Coilwork: leveling when you know a 100% buff is coming feels really bad
[5:10:20] Mumples: bg time
[5:10:20] chunkybluchz: DUELS
[5:10:20] gratzitko: boomy seems to kinda oom alot
[5:10:30] gratzitko: id say bgs
[5:10:34] chunkybluchz: im tryna learn how to pvp better
[5:10:36] motorika: duelz
[5:10:39] chunkybluchz: so duels would be cool
[5:10:43] Kreynz: so STV is still the main pvp event in phase 3 as well right? No new one?

[5:12:01] Mumples: 100 ms isnt rly that noticable in wow

[5:12:34] Hydramist: Save on selected AMD Ryzen™ processors only for a limited time! Buy now → https://upu.gg/c/deals/24981496
[5:12:35] Kreynz: i found it really hard to death seduce in wrath on 200ms, had to preemptively death when i thought they would use seduce rather than reactively lol
[5:12:44] Mumples: i mean 200 is a lot lol
[5:13:22] voodoodrop: how about lvl a war??
[5:13:22] Ephixza: the 50% increased exp is nice not gonna lie!
[5:13:27] voodoodrop: do you even?
[5:13:37] mylittlehombre: ab would be awesome
[5:13:37] Kreynz: i had like 10 games in a row into chan and people in his chat were like 'does this priest have death bound' and im like bruh u try to death chans seduces on 200ms xd
[5:13:48] Mumples: warrs seem kinda meh atm in pvp
[5:13:51] durtybob: ele shaman
[5:13:52] mylittlehombre: ya Druid are nuts
[5:13:53] Mumples: need a dedicated healer
[5:14:02] chunkybluchz: if you macro /pray to your shadow word death you'll say a prayer for your enemy before you kill them xD
[5:14:07] Ephixza: feral is good, seen dakkan doing insane bursts, ofc he would kill me if i spread it
[5:14:18] voodoodrop: a beefy boy with a bis healer on its back you 2v5 EASILY
[5:14:37] Mumples: idk about 2v5
[5:14:42] voodoodrop: EASILY
[5:14:46] Mumples: not sure about that 1
[5:15:15] mylittlehombre: what about the aoe heal
[5:15:19] mylittlehombre: with mage
[5:15:48] Kreynz: ive just been running a spec with blackout as disc yolo
[5:15:49] Allstarplayabro: your not really gonna be hard casting in blood moon so i think renew is bis
[5:16:10] Mumples: imp renew is shite ye
[5:16:15] mylittlehombre: oh rly then that’s trash
[5:16:27] mylittlehombre: the crit is super nice if you get it on Pom
[5:16:55] Ephixza: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_7dR0RuMCg please this pls ryan
[5:17:18] Locktapuss: cheeky slapper for the list https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--3eIRSg2RY&ab_channel=PaulvanDyk
[5:17:25] Mumples: u ever manaburning in disc in blood moon
[5:17:49] mylittlehombre: yea imo inner fire doesn’t do a lot imo
[5:17:58] Kreynz: meanwhile i feel like whenever a hunter vipers me i lose 20% of my mana from it
[5:18:00] Kreynz: i hate viper so much
[5:18:13] Kreynz: yer i know just lazy xd
[5:18:15] jallaballan: What about full holy and redeemer rune?
[5:18:24] Mumples: ye viper is cringe as priest without anti lol
[5:18:30] mylittlehombre: full holy sucks imo
[5:19:13] prodigy_wow: They put each other on cd
[5:19:13] trickypork: good luck in the tourney hydraaa, unless you get against hozi then i hope you're second, but you know good luck anyway
[5:19:15] Kreynz: i would assume it would share a cd when rune swapping with disperse
[5:19:22] Kreynz: since pain sup and disperse share cds when rune swapping
[5:19:36] prodigy_wow: Redeemer is so depressing
[5:19:38] mylittlehombre: pain supp feels better
[5:20:01] trickypork: oh i see, thanks for the intel, well i hope you have lots of fun in any case
[5:20:19] prodigy_wow: Doesn't make sense to run redeemer, the rune butchers the talent. You'd rather have pain sup or disperse and then have a free redeemer when you die too
[5:20:34] prodigy_wow: Instead of just one on use redeemer every 5 mins
[5:20:50] Allstarplayabro: @Hydramist what are your thoughts about blizzard rolling back the GDKP ban on taiwain/china servers?
[5:21:11] prodigy_wow: I'd love to see more holy support
[5:21:17] prodigy_wow: It's still the least played spec
[5:21:25] Locktapuss: cheeky slapper for the list https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--3eIRSg2RY&ab_channel=PaulvanDyk
[5:21:29] Kreynz: spectral guise instead of redeemer woulda been fun
[5:21:33] Kreynz: u'd actually use it
[5:21:48] gloneiric: please blizzard put in an archangel rune
[5:21:51] DanUK_47: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JXYo0PR4mQ
[5:22:00] prodigy_wow: I was thinking of a rune that makes light wall follow the priest
[5:22:02] trickypork: that would be quite fun, to augment the capstone talents specifically
[5:22:07] prodigy_wow: Light well*
[5:22:07] amexpog: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6LSIBpCzrc
[5:22:08] Mumples: lightwell such a meme
[5:22:11] Alori_: @Hydramist https://youtu.be/WKdAt8uwSg0
[5:22:17] Spindall: i want a wotlk rapture rune for disc
[5:22:22] Kreynz: turn lightwell into a healing stream totem that actually does a decent amount of healing
[5:22:36] gloneiric: i think cata archangel would be the sickest rune
[5:22:45] prodigy_wow: Rapture is pretty cool
[5:22:47] Kreynz: i like wrath rapture but disc has good enough mana as it is
[5:22:54] Spindall: gives you mana when shield is fully used

[5:23:29] prodigy_wow: That would be really neat
[5:23:31] Locktapuss: hopefully paul van dyke made it
[5:23:54] Mumples: it's always annoying having to pick between some major cds like barrier
[5:24:13] Locktapuss: big time pump
[5:24:36] gloneiric: shadow orbs rune ooo
[5:24:36] Kreynz: isn't it really hard to death poly in vanilla cause of how insane spell pushback is
[5:24:45] kjozz: on the roadmap it dosent say there is a new pvp event at level 50, only new runes and a new raid.
[5:24:46] Mumples: not really
[5:25:07] Mumples: @kjozz id be surprised if they dont
[5:25:20] ExehnTV: hydra is imp vapiric emrace worth it for duels?
[5:25:23] BorgirPVP: I miss Atonement healing
[5:25:29] Kaekias: @Mumples like priest hasn't enough cds xD
[5:25:48] Kaekias: for duels you don't need spirit tap, though
[5:25:57] Kaekias: or am i missing something?
[5:25:59] Kaekias: just from a glance

[5:27:17] prodigy_wow: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=412113/remove-greater-curse
[5:28:03] Kreynz: they should have added silvershard mine, since it's located in STV!
[5:28:39] ExehnTV: classicauraduration not working in duels?
[5:29:56] Kreynz: they should just let actually see enemy buffs/debuffs in sod since everyone uses the addon anyway

[5:35:52] Locktapuss: @ExehnTV rogue and mage I think

[5:42:49] Kreynz: holy fuck what are these mage healer buffs!
[5:43:16] solstixeK1: "Grimoire of Synergy now increases damage done by the Warlock and their pet by 25% when it is active (was 5%)"  This gonna be nutty for Link locks lmao
[5:44:30] KcolraWertex: brainfreeze is used but frostfire bolt and spellfrost bolt competes with missile barrage
[5:44:31] HeyImArty: ye but they have fuckall hp
[5:44:37] Kreynz: that ability heals for as much as a greater heal on a 2 sec cast
[5:44:38] HeyImArty: it doesnt heal others for alot is the point
[5:44:42] Kreynz: it heals for like 1.2k non-crit
[5:44:54] Mumples: 88% is hefty
[5:44:55] Alori_: @Hydramist https://youtu.be/yeClJneSNXA

[5:46:44] solstixeK1: Soul link gonna be nutty
[5:46:50] solstixeK1: with ysn
[5:46:54] HeyImArty: i hate instant searing pain above most other things, idk why
[5:47:27] jujujay_myalias: Evenn as a warlock instant searing pain is dumb tbh
[5:47:51] solstixeK1: meta is just banish
[5:47:53] HeyImArty: its a noticeable ret buff
[5:48:42] jujujay_myalias: meta is rough in stv due to banish xD
[5:48:45] Locktapuss: rofl, u can banish a warlock in meta?
[5:49:06] Locktapuss: that's just dumb even if it's super avoidable
[5:49:12] Templetacos: adds ffs lol
[5:49:14] Kameril: Lock strong
[5:51:20] fdaapproved123: is this supposed to be pvp tier list?
[5:51:32] HeyImArty: @fdaapproved123 yes
[5:51:40] fdaapproved123: ok
[5:52:07] prodigy_wow: I haven't faced an adrenaline rush mutilate rogue yet but I feel like it could be really scary in a duel
[5:52:13] KcolraWertex: i think they need to buff icelance if they want frost to be viable
[5:52:34] fdaapproved123: warriors better than SL lock?
[5:53:06] fdaapproved123: feels like warrior should be F tier xD
[5:53:29] HeyImArty: Arms is rly good in group pvp, good harassment, MS, bulky frontline
[5:53:33] Distorpia: they just don't want to buff affliction it's insane
[5:53:47] KcolraWertex: warriors can also delete people in intercept stuns
[5:53:53] prodigy_wow: Commanding
[5:54:00] HeyImArty: Commanding & Rallying

[5:54:56] Mumples: ye war needs some better runes
[5:54:58] Locktapuss: Warrior gunna have a hard time with all these mages existing
[5:55:02] Ultrasuz: I feel that Boomie is not S, rather A maybe and Rogue S

[5:56:19] fictionless33: i messed up opener lol
[5:56:21] fictionless33: lets go again wait for cds
[5:56:31] Locktapuss: @KcolraWertex main issues is boomkin mage and priest on top, they all crush warrior, hunter beats them as melee too which is hilarious

[5:56:59] Ry_Bann: Shaman or Hunter better for 40 and onward into higher levels?
[5:57:27] Distorpia: its comical they buffed boomkin dots , feels like every caster has dots stronger than affliction
[5:57:32] Ultrasuz: @hydramist can you explain why boomie is S, looks more like A
[5:57:38] desmoli: did I just miss a new tier list

[5:58:12] Mumples: @Ultrasuz boomie is top tier in open world and bg content
[5:58:13] Goated_Goods: Put all of the melee below the casters for BM event. Can't hit anyone while casters just spam through the lag ;)
[5:58:20] solstixeK1: Soul link hautn can easily 1v2
[5:58:22] solstixeK1: its great
[5:58:22] Distorpia: healing tier list updates?
[5:58:24] Mumples: cause of spread dmg and mobility bear etc
[5:59:11] Kaekias: nerf 1 button specs, for sure

[6:02:33] solstixeK1: it would be so fun to watch
[6:02:45] fdaapproved123: @solstixeK1 SP just wins currently
[6:02:55] fdaapproved123: but yeah no good SL locks around
[6:03:07] solstixeK1: a good SL lock is dangerous even for spriest
[6:03:26] fdaapproved123: i agree but good luck finding one
[6:03:46] luzid7: they just oneshot you in 1 sec thats also not healthy for the game xD

[6:18:01] Kreynz: seems really dumb
[6:18:04] awkwor_d: @MF_Eyedea warlock buffs look underwhelming
[6:18:16] stuart805: orc probably overall bis rogue race for pvp in sod right? especially with the new trinket pvp removal stuff
[6:18:22] gratzitko: @awkwor_d did u expect anything more from blizzlmao
[6:18:24] MF_Eyedea: I mean boring for sure but 20% buff is nice
[6:18:25] pew2700: Itll be really good in pvp too.. problem with chrono now was mana cost.  and now regen healing is back to being increased.  Spellfrost imo is gonna make frost viable

[6:19:53] Locktapuss: putting gnome above orc is wild

[6:20:45] MF_Eyedea: only 88% buff LOL
[6:21:03] Locktapuss: 88% coefficient
[6:21:16] Mumples: @Kreynz pve :P
[6:21:18] MF_Eyedea: still beyond big

[6:29:23] Kreynz: yeah this is what i dont get about it
[6:29:26] Kreynz: chrono already heals so much
[6:29:36] Kreynz: i get reducing the mana cost but why buff the raw healing it does lol
[6:30:06] Kreynz: you will be able to just heal through MS with chrono now
[6:30:15] pew2700: The raw healing is more for pve.. because mages were wearing spellpower gear not healing power
[6:30:32] Kreynz: it's the same in pve tho, if u chrono someone on 20% it will full heal them currently pre-buff
[6:30:37] Kreynz: so the buff will just make it overheal lol
[6:30:40] Charocalypse: the start vs enh is to simply just roll over and gg next

[6:30:45] MF_Eyedea: balanced
[6:30:51] econicz: does silence + mindcontrol work ?
[6:30:53] SgtPepperTTV: they said because arcane mage takes + damage as a healer they need to compensate the healing to compete with other healers that do + healing gear. I am a mage player so I don't mind it but I was out healing other healers already, Mage might be S tier healer now

[6:34:04] pew2700: @awkwor_d What??? Feral is like bottom of the charts atm.  And in Pvp they rely on their cds  and outside of cds its very meh damage.
[6:34:17] Kreynz: theres also the lvl 38 wsg ring that is nearly as good
[6:34:18] Kreynz: and has stam
[6:34:33] pew2700: Not to mention super squish in cat form,  no mana for shifts/kite/hots etc
[6:34:48] vrsswow: Disco priest have solid potentional in duels , whats your opninion on that
[6:34:49] solstixeK1: 14sp and 10 stam is pretty good upgrade, especially if you really want to go bis
[6:35:32] Locktapuss: outside of silence yeah it's jsut asking for trouble and if impact procs haha
[6:35:34] Longtimer49: i feel the same with lava burst. sometimes that cast time is 8 seconds lol

[6:36:39] pew2700: @awkwor_d Balanced druids are not lower.  Rogues are not lower.  Ranged hunters yes, which they received a slight buff
[6:36:45] farhan_1801: does shadow lose against feral in 1vs1?

[6:37:59] SgtPepperTTV: ctrl + v and use the WA that show buffs
[6:38:01] Kreynz: u need a mage to use detect magic on them!
[6:38:07] gratzitko: did they break it on purpose
[6:38:13] SgtPepperTTV: or the addon big debuff
[6:38:24] farhan_1801: nah man making buffs visible is only good for classes that can purge
[6:38:38] Kreynz: in classic it's not intended to see buffs unless a mage uses detect magic on them lol
[6:38:41] Kreynz: but yer i agree it's dumb
[6:39:05] luzid7: why is everyone playing fire mage its good in bgs but i feel like frost i way better for 1v1
[6:39:28] Kreynz: yer deep frost is better for 1v1 unless u go for arcane power 1 shot surge cheese
[6:39:40] guhsilqueira: u dying to fire bomb i guess

[6:42:13] solstixeK1: is he pom?
[6:42:20] Kreynz: could pain sup be better since u can still stay offensive with it and 8 sec duration?
[6:42:34] appolonia1: can't you outburst him?
[6:42:49] luzid7: you hear the proc but maybe only the mage hear it
[6:43:14] solstixeK1: can you disperse pyro if its airborne?
[6:43:26] gratzitko: what do you mean when u keep saying they broke it, did they break the addon on purpose
[6:43:44] awkwor_d: @pew2700 yes they are xd, you can literally see max percentile
[6:44:03] Visioned: So, the real strat is to just run
[6:44:08] ferreiraxdtv: 20s living flame
[6:45:02] Visioned: basically, the game already knows the damage and your character just hasn't shown it yet
[6:45:03] deltrexx: can drain life be casted while moving with the rune? i cant cast it while moving
[6:45:33] solstixeK1: @deltrexx lock rune? its master channeler
[6:45:40] solstixeK1: not the same icon as dl lol
[6:45:50] awkwor_d: @deltrexx and can be dispelled
[6:46:01] Kreynz: thoughts on pain sup for the duel?
[6:46:41] pew2700: @awkwor_d You dont ever look at that... lol
[6:46:44] Spliiff: What Addon for number sort
[6:46:46] Kreynz: just thinking u can continue using gcds with it and it lasts 8 sec
[6:47:01] bluegorillas: @hydramist Are donations taxable?
[6:47:31] pew2700: @awkwor_d If you looked at boss per boss balance is above feral overall.  Only 2 bosses feral shines are the first 2 when they are 20-30 sec fights and within their berserk window
[6:47:35] awkwor_d: @pew2700 why, you dont wanna look at average people who dont even try to PvE right? xd

[6:48:20] Kreynz: see look at that, he just chrono'd himself from 1% to 83% and they're buffing it by 88%? lol
[6:48:35] pew2700: @Kreynz its not actually an 88% buff..
[6:48:55] Kreynz: right, but still why does it need to heal more than that lol
[6:49:15] conedaddy420: doesnt scale
[6:49:17] Maycryx: cuz blizz makes changes based off pve aswell
[6:49:27] Kreynz: yer but it wont change anything in pve
[6:49:28] paco__gutierrez: @Kreynz spell power coefficient not total healing
[6:49:44] Kreynz: you still wont use chrono in pve

[6:52:57] optik_rec0rds: agree
[6:53:06] Brbgmafell: bro i was duelinig last night on my spriiest bitchhin about same shit
[6:53:07] Kreynz: but mages need their detect magic niche!
[6:53:08] Kreynz: jk
[6:53:17] Brbgmafell: needs to be fixed asap
[6:53:39] stuart805: what was that mage name from the old tbc videos hydra dueled?
[6:53:40] j1gge: if i was a blizz dev i would fix it right now for u hydra. it would take prob not even 5 min
[6:54:05] Maycryx: yah and add dueling support infront of cities

[6:57:32] Maycryx: not*
[6:57:40] prodigy_wow: maybe an hot take but its not like we are supposed to be able to see enemy buffs in vanilla wow
[6:57:48] prodigy_wow: Classic aura durations is kind of cheating
[6:57:58] prodigy_wow: anyone without it is at a massive disadvantage
[6:58:07] optik_rec0rds: well it makes for a way better experience
[6:58:12] optik_rec0rds: hiding buffs is just dumb.
[6:58:23] Longtimer49: mages healing is such a disgusting concept lol. imagine if a warrior could spam cast full heals
[6:58:32] prodigy_wow: it doesnt make anything"better" it makes people who can purge stronger

[6:59:18] DrMaggz: Seeing why you use your spells is basic stuff, no?
[6:59:43] Kreynz: omg yer having mage/ice armour get dispelled is so frustrating lol
[7:00:10] optik_rec0rds: i dont even play a purge class atm and i still wanna see the enemies buffs so i can react and not go like "huh guess he used xx "
[7:00:14] prodigy_wow: Considering vanilla has no dispel protection, having hidden buffs is a reasonable balance
[7:00:25] kkiburz324: try that same thing with twisted fate rune and it might work
[7:00:55] SnotBoogey: @Prodigy________________  vanilla dispell protection is basically the amount of trash buffs and rank 1 buffs
[7:01:08] prodigy_wow: Thats not what i mean when i say dispel protection though
[7:01:13] SnotBoogey: i get that
[7:01:18] SnotBoogey: obv
[7:01:37] nikaedge: do you always win duels vs shamans?
[7:01:38] foolsendit: its on a cd i think
[7:01:44] artform_: living bomb explodes if u dispel it
[7:01:45] optik_rec0rds: yeah got no cd and you still get the explosion damage on dispell
[7:01:49] optik_rec0rds: dont think you should
[7:02:06] foolsendit: @optik_rec0rds oo didnt know it was no cd thats nice
[7:02:39] Toxiferous: SP with peneance KEKW
[7:03:42] xavouzas: and he might get hot-streak procs from explosion
[7:03:44] artform_: yeah and the explosion can crit and ignite you, not worth dispel it

[7:05:24] nikaedge: to life drain i guess
[7:05:27] foe____: can you dispel imp scorch? if so i think its then worth to dispel living bomb cause multiple stacks of fire vulnerability with a living bomb is big dam
[7:05:34] foe____: 2

[7:05:48] SnotBoogey: 2 spells

[8:27:55] bojji900: KEKW
[8:28:30] bojji900: shouldnt they go back to the old client or is it just lost in the sauce
[8:28:54] iamnotsharpie: that's more work than they'd ever want to commit
[8:32:07] Selecktt: I think the entire SOD project is blizzard testing the waters and dipping their toes into a complete classic+ revamp/rework. Reusing existing spells and animations fits the bill.
[8:32:15] nelms42: Have three spots for each alter imo
[8:32:22] nelms42: possible spawns
[8:32:34] Xolido: can u solo Dead mines with wind flay ?
[8:32:43] Xolido: mind**
[8:34:44] Selecktt: @maleficiously I mean more along the lines of a complete rework and overhaul. SOD has all the makings of a pilot program. Small, easy to implement changes using existing spells/abilities/zones/instances. Requires very little new work, but gauges players reaction to major changes to classic.
[8:35:09] Selecktt: I think it's a stepping stone to a much, much larger rework IF SOD proves to be very successful.
[8:35:20] bojji900: what do you think about a fresh normal classic server. beside SOD. since they are cooking, and if something goes bad they can take their time to fix it. Like insane damage output in pvp.
[8:35:59] bojji900: or would that be to many servers KEKW
[8:36:10] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist

[8:38:30] maldommm: yo
[8:39:48] notgarru: explaining factorials might be a bit above twitch
[8:39:52] nelms42: No you are right
[8:40:04] Coilwork: is this factorio?
[8:40:10] dely404: isn't it additive ?
[8:40:13] bojji900: i mean only people who actually does game networking which i heard is actually quite hard
[8:40:14] Tristelol: would add
[8:40:19] bojji900: can know that
[8:41:29] Tristelol: this is also based on the blizz mentality

[8:42:18] MxKV__: PepoG
[8:42:30] nelms42: What about the people around that arent in these grps?
[8:42:33] dely404: But its not peer to peer ?
[8:42:39] nelms42: + their abilities?
[8:42:50] Tristelol: @nelms42 this
[8:43:11] Tristelol: based on auto attack
[8:43:22] Ephixza: went to play retail played solo q and i could not stand my self man
[8:43:52] MxKV__: all why teaching us math LUL
[8:43:56] bojji900: mmo networking is really hard to figure out so i dont blame them taking their time
[8:44:20] freazyblack: 7 raiders from freazyblack have joined! 
[8:44:22] dely404: But the package sent from the server would be the same person, no? its just about the package load that i can manage per node ?
[8:44:26] freazyblack: yoyoy  ryan
[8:44:28] freazyblack: <3
[8:44:42] freazyblack: ah we chillin:>
[8:44:51] freazyblack: i just said i send them to  an old legend <3
[8:45:01] freazyblack: freazyblack subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! wub wqub
[8:45:02] bojji900: I think the way nostalrius did it, they reduced player vision so that kinda fixed the problem
[8:45:27] nelms42: I don't know if even that will fix it
[8:45:30] nelms42: It may make it better
[8:45:43] nelms42: But there will still be massive spikes
[8:46:07] dely404: The diffrence with nost and retail is that nost didn't have 100k diffrent shit running in the background
[8:46:13] bojji900: i dont know what view distance is set at right now, but its real far no?
[8:46:14] bondaru07: !song
[8:46:21] bondaru07: !playing
[8:46:22] Coilwork: man is forgetting the streamer effect, they'll follow the streamer for headhunting Aware
[8:46:25] bojji900: nostalrius had 40yard view distance
[8:46:27] bondaru07: !playlist
[8:46:38] solstixeK1: I think its like 75y or something
[8:46:48] solstixeK1: more in closed instances
[8:46:59] bojji900: that could also be a potential fix
[8:47:17] nelms42: Client needs to be reworked for open scale battles. You said it the best its legion based which is the primary problem
[8:47:23] dely404: But nost's client was the old mangos build so its not even close to whats used on retail nowdays
[8:47:43] dely404: Server structre is completly diffrent
[8:47:45] bojji900: they are to scared to invest much in classic
[8:47:46] nelms42: You can remove the world boss, What happens in BRM and Silithus later?
[8:48:01] solstixeK1: Is probably down to hardware and its not enough money to expand
[8:48:13] nelms42: They have to, What happens in BRM?
[8:48:21] nelms42: We just lag to the instance?
[8:48:45] nelms42: We just skip silithus and open the raid?
[8:48:52] jacobx9898: isnt wow one of the only subscription games that lags?
[8:48:56] jacobx9898: or the only?
[8:48:57] solar_tax: !guide
[8:48:57] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvcBhJCtj0
[8:49:00] jacobx9898: thats kind of an excuse
[8:49:27] jacobx9898: the 15 bucks a month just gets swept under the rug "Dont have money or resources"
[8:49:36] dely404: They've lost touch with the community its not about making goods games anymore. Its about making money
[8:49:36] nelms42: You're right about that, but Profits only exist as long as the product is good.
[8:49:47] bojji900: They probably dont want to invest into something thats not 100% giving them money back. if i was an investor i wouldnt
[8:50:34] bojji900: yup
[8:51:17] bojji900: i think they gave up after overwatch KEKW
[8:51:31] dely404: Its like the retails first store mount, it out sold sc2 within 6 months KEKW with an ingame buyable
[8:51:32] jacobx9898: I think its a little insane that we all pay monthly, they make events that are designed for mass pvp, and they know it doesnt function
[8:51:33] trolls912: looking forward to riot mmo
[8:51:42] jacobx9898: They are shipping a product they know wont work, this path isnt right
[8:52:00] jacobx9898: Just stop making mass wpvp events if you dont want to invest
[8:52:00] bojji900: diablo 4 is such a good example of that ye
[8:52:08] realbiza: do you miss arena hydra? tbc times
[8:52:27] bojji900: best time was 1st classic
[8:52:38] jacobx9898: classic 2019 when wpvp wasnt forced
[8:52:41] jacobx9898: was such a good time
[8:52:43] prophacyx: tbc classic and vanilla classic were my favorates
[8:52:56] bojji900: ye they were dope
[8:53:07] jacobx9898: Wrath derailed the train a bit
[8:53:12] jacobx9898: we now have Gearscore in classic LUL
[8:53:20] prophacyx: i expected alot more from wotlk
[8:53:26] prophacyx: but kinda dissapointed
[8:53:35] solstixeK1: peopel that use gs in classic are aids
[8:53:37] jacobx9898: Wrath changed how people approach Classic
[8:53:49] prophacyx: ye
[8:54:04] jacobx9898: You can just feel it
[8:54:07] jacobx9898: compared to 2019
[8:54:57] solstixeK1: wrath is literally just molten wow which is cancer
[8:54:58] bojji900: i only play classic so i dont know about that
[8:55:01] solstixeK1: warmane i mean
[8:55:01] notgarru: and by that he means tbc community didnt have or at least had less scripters LUL
[8:55:11] jacobx9898: Warmane culture is monkaS
[8:56:14] jacobx9898: People that willingly play War pal for 15 years are psycho
[8:56:16] dashqt: @notgarru I can't believe how bad scripting actually is, I was so blind and now I've seen stuff it's actually mindboggling lol
[8:56:34] xpoisonzc: how do u beat a rogue thats pve n coldblood their env hits me for 1350

[8:57:16] notgarru: its actually gross watching peoples solo shuffle streams and seeing every ele instant do everything
[8:57:20] jacobx9898: @dashqt simple, ego
[8:57:24] jacobx9898: @dashqt go watch Qwneer
[8:57:28] bojji900: retail has insane amounts of scripters acording to my friend
[8:57:38] bojji900: he plays alot of arena
[8:57:43] xpoisonzc: how do u beat a rogue thats pve n coldblood their env hits me for 1350 as spri
[8:57:56] jacobx9898: Warr is so easy to script too
[8:57:57] notgarru: absterge does a lot of calling it out but idk if others do
[8:57:59] jacobx9898: the way its designed
[8:58:05] notgarru: cant say i watch too many retail streamers tbh
[8:58:30] jacobx9898: Truth
[8:58:34] jacobx9898: Actually sad.
[8:58:45] jacobx9898: yes
[8:58:48] jacobx9898: They share scripts etc
[8:59:00] jacobx9898: well Torsten for sure spread scripts
[8:59:01] notgarru: to quote torsten "i'm just better"
[8:59:24] jacobx9898: LOL
[8:59:27] jacobx9898: exactly.
[8:59:29] notgarru: its only funny because he wasnt just better
[8:59:41] notgarru: banned LUL
[9:00:05] jacobx9898: Especially the way war pal is
[9:00:10] jacobx9898: Its such a scripted meta
[9:00:16] jacobx9898: how do you lose
[9:01:00] notgarru: you used to play apex right?
[9:01:02] jacobx9898: LUL
[9:01:04] bojji900: KEKW
[9:01:06] jacobx9898: gotta trick them that way
[9:01:10] jacobx9898: Disgusting class
[9:01:21] notgarru: there was a nice little clip of 15 people trying to beat a god mode cheater, so it could be worse i guess
[9:01:49] dashqt: I remember watching Mir vs a Hpala and he literally could not gouge the Pala for like the whole game the consistency of it is just idk man lol
[9:01:49] bomzzwtf: crazy amount of hp? got like all stam gear?

[9:02:13] jacobx9898: I can see why he got burnt
[9:02:27] solstixeK1: didnt they disable cancelaura?=
[9:02:28] Coilwork: wow, yeah that's shit
[9:02:45] classiccyb: right now
[9:02:54] classiccyb: its because they havent input spell id to classic client
[9:03:01] classiccyb: its a bug they are trying to work on
[9:03:11] Coilwork: KEKW
