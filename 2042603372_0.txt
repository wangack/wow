[4:04:20] velidien: sean seems to want to be a raid lead, he needs to make his own guild and just leave KEKW
[4:04:24] roguerhino: the guild will implode from a mental boom
[4:04:30] oatpleb: Who is Sean?
[4:04:38] baseboned: at least he's not mashing his keyboard while talking
[4:04:49] Skunkjudge: everyone's brain is so big that they're making stacking harder
[4:04:49] MierkaBlue: yeah, consistency is great
[4:04:53] Thiccidaddy: the way he talks would make me rage, tbh. I know im petty.
[4:04:58] velidien: Im going to keep it a stack, im not trying to hate, but have they ever taken accountability themselves or do they think they play 200% perfection everypull?
[4:04:59] caseypastella: man i hate raiding, m+ forever
[4:05:06] Thiccidaddy: not talking to, but talkin down
[4:05:33] ReSeT_VT: This is really standard m raid i think
[4:05:42] ReSeT_VT: Communication wise
[4:06:13] roguerhino: idk man those RWF guilds are solid as hell

[4:06:18] roguerhino: with their mental
[4:06:31] Luna_Trashpanda: @roguerhino That is not the standard haha
[4:06:39] roguerhino: also true
[4:07:07] roguerhino: i havent every raided mythic because of how crazy it gets sometimes
[4:07:10] velidien: @Luna_Trashpanda thats true, but thers a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it, and also if you never accept accountability yourself your words are hallow and meaningless
[4:07:20] ReSeT_VT: Yea, after 200 pulls on a boss you need to talk about things. Sure people might take it badly but those people usually get benched at the 5th boss
[4:07:44] velidien: M+ gang baby
[4:08:19] hdott52: Looking
[4:08:26] Luna_Trashpanda: Its honestly just really hard to find a group of people at this size that are both good enough to be there and are good humans. Your always going to have to give abit

[4:08:48] Luna_Trashpanda: It shouldnt be that way but it is

[4:15:45] Luna_Trashpanda: @oatpleb "Im not mad, Im just disappointed"
[4:15:47] MierkaBlue: raid leading this fight as a healer is a lot, I think he is doing great
[4:15:56] velidien: I have a feeling this raid has broken down a lot of guilds and broken apart a lot of guilds imo
[4:16:20] velidien: specifically Tswift
[4:16:33] Manual_Matt: No frost DK. I see the issue
[4:16:36] roguerhino: dude Tswift is a guild destroyer

[4:18:19] Left_The_Legacy: What's the thing holding y'all back from killing M fyrakk so far you think?

[4:33:08] senseiheals: oh hey no disband
[4:33:19] MierkaBlue: I've seen people mark the friendly add spawns for easier calling and dodging
[4:33:20] Moreon___: idk i liked it, and was much better than healing whatever this shit is on fyrakk
[4:33:57] baseboned: well definitely better, since it was just one npc with a frame and not 98423 different npcs without a frame
[4:34:21] Luna_Trashpanda: Yeah having a frame made it more tolerable

[4:44:38] velidien: I see what the problem is. You should be mandated a GeoTime game in between each pull to refresh the mind
[4:46:05] IAmSolari: today reminded me of why I stopped tanking pugs

[4:48:02] velidien: @roomzie you talking about the timer and abilities?
[4:48:11] kurwiszczon: How bad is healing keys compared to shadowlands? Heard it's super terrible
[4:48:13] roomzie: yeah his main weakaura i mean
[4:48:19] IAmSolari: @velidien just people not doing any affix mechanics, not kicking casters in sanguine and getting angy at me when their key depletes
[4:48:20] velidien: !wa

[4:48:56] velidien: @IAmSolari damn
[4:48:57] Luna_Trashpanda: @IAmSolari Sounds like a pretty normal experience tbh
[4:49:02] Skunkjudge: @kurwiszczon healing isn't too bad this season. Def the dungeons are harder than SL, but it's very achievable
[4:49:34] IAmSolari: I'm by no means a great player but man...
[4:50:10] Luna_Trashpanda: @kurwiszczon There is more reliance on teams to do the right things which has generally made pugging a more difficult experience than SL
[4:50:48] IAmSolari: @Luna_Trashpanda yeah it was more of a reminder than anything
[4:51:10] velidien: GeoTime for breaksi
[4:51:15] baseboned: df dungeons are more about surviving than timing, compared to shadowlands feels like

[4:53:15] IAmSolari: I don't really understand why so many people hate you, you don't say anything crazy KEKW
[4:53:16] velidien: end of patch vibes all the wow players on geo
[4:53:30] velidien: @IAmSolari hes a healer, its the life he chose sadly
[4:53:34] Skunkjudge: anatolia moment
[4:53:43] pinkagandalf: turkey the animal?
[4:54:05] Luna_Trashpanda: @IAmSolari People just like to be dicks, they hear their streamer being a bully and they think its ok for them to do it basically
[4:54:17] minimi12001: grass is green as hell, gotta be scandinavia
[4:54:31] 1111111111112233: geo Pog
[4:54:51] harzu_: KKona
[4:54:54] lapissuu: KKona
[4:55:02] BlazinHurricane: KKona
[4:55:06] minimi12001: midwest chatting
[4:55:09] IAmSolari: I was going to say montana
[4:55:27] lapissuu: OMEGALUL
[4:55:50] reedsworld: mexico
[4:56:00] 1111111111112233: that looks like a mosque tower
[4:56:04] IAmSolari: @Luna_Trashpanda parasocial weirdos tbh
[4:56:42] IAmSolari: india
[4:56:50] Luna_Trashpanda: @IAmSolari Just standard lacking of social skills. The internet is great for it
[4:57:22] minimi12001: especially wow too imo
[4:57:46] IAmSolari: nobody does social ineptitude quite like the world of warcraft community
[4:57:56] minimi12001: some of the most insane lack of social skills ive ever witnessed have been in like +11-+15 pugs
[4:58:13] lapissuu: adave
[4:58:18] baseboned: what is adave supposed to be?
[4:58:19] harzu_: adave
[4:58:23] minimi12001: adave is adave
[4:58:30] Earthtusks: adave
[4:58:38] velidien: @baseboned it is what it is
[4:58:45] kurwiszczon: @minimi12001 i think you mean 20s but then its also inflated ego
[4:58:54] baseboned: danse died for this
[4:58:57] baseboned: sadge
[4:58:59] Luna_Trashpanda: Yeah look MMOs are up there, but I think thats just because there is the ability to communicate. Ive played plenty of FPS games that have a similar level of ineptitude
[4:59:28] lapissuu: Ragey liars
[4:59:29] minimi12001: 11-15 range is somehow worse in my experience, most 20s ive done this season have gone smoothly, last season i played w a new-ish friend and stuck to 11s-15s and it was wayyy worse
[5:00:02] redlegs19: obv I am killing that pussy you know
[5:00:08] minimi12001: last season dungeons also sucked which prolly contributed but idk
[5:00:20] Luna_Trashpanda: I think it changes over an expac tbh, like it shifts as it gets easier to do higher keys at the end.
[5:00:46] IAmSolari: Fort volcanic spiteful in 2 weeks LETSGOOO
[5:00:57] Luna_Trashpanda: But I would agree the worst range is the "I want to cruise through" level of key where noone puts in any effort
[5:01:27] velidien: @Luna_Trashpanda 5-10 is just a fun time KEKW
[5:01:32] IAmSolari: I am excited to tell my pug teammates to stop hitting the spiteful mobs
[5:01:46] minimi12001: no kicks, no ccs, and difference in tank ability in 11-15 is craaaaazy, sometimes youll get a god gamer tank then sometimes youll get someone who doesnt know what sanguine does
[5:01:59] velidien: you legit are doing a Mythic 0 basically and people treat it like a 20 because theyre just starting out on keys and you can just chill and watch them try the hardest
[5:02:14] Luna_Trashpanda: @velidien You can still time a key in that range with everyone just face rolling though so it works out ok
[5:02:23] LordOni: Any lookers?
[5:02:26] velidien: Looking
[5:02:36] lapissuu: Looking
[5:02:48] minimi12001: love that they made dragons instead of giving priest more mobility
[5:03:24] IAmSolari: @Luna_Trashpanda I would say just above that cruise level is the worst, because you get the people from the faceroll keys not doing any mechanics when they actually need to
[5:03:33] Luna_Trashpanda: @minimi12001 But dragons give the priest mobility LUL
[5:03:51] minimi12001: rescue basically being a priest mobility spell is so funny
[5:03:58] velidien: devoker evoker is fun to say and for that reason im going to main them in war within

[5:04:17] velidien: i also understand devoker evoker is like saying rip in peace but it is fun to say lol
[5:04:17] minimi12001: also ur a chad for going devoker
[5:04:26] minimi12001: fuck augs
[5:04:52] Luna_Trashpanda: @IAmSolari Ah yeah thats my fault in the phrasing. I meant the range you mentioned, where it should be cruisy to time but its where all the problems hit
[5:04:54] velidien: I feel bad for people who actively enjoy being a dps support role, but also fuck augs KEKW
[5:05:25] minimi12001: i would enjoy a supportive role if it was actually a support role and not the abomination that aug is
[5:05:29] velidien: the downside is its a mandatory spec so you have people who dont enjoy playing it playing it too
[5:05:40] sundayz58: PunchTrees
[5:05:41] velidien: @minimi12001 true
[5:05:45] minimi12001: comparitive dps to a regular dps with the utility of like multiple healers
[5:05:51] minimi12001: so cringe
[5:05:52] IAmSolari: aug won't be op forever
[5:06:02] IAmSolari: it's not a mage or warlock
[5:06:04] minimi12001: and they fuck up details and logs, so like, fuck augs
[5:06:07] Luna_Trashpanda: Aug was an interesting choice. They didnt learn anything from Disc. You cant bring in a meta defining class and not expect it to either be broken or useless
[5:06:08] velidien: it would be nice if there was another 1-2 support dps roles
[5:06:11] TheTavan: wait wait wait
[5:06:18] pinkagandalf: hahahaha
[5:06:28] minimi12001: !best
[5:06:29] TheTavan: @yumytv raids with TmSean?

[5:07:21] Juicewolff: blugatti epic
[5:07:24] LordOni: Fuck it, sending lust
[5:07:25] velidien: what is yalls lust keybind?
[5:07:28] minimi12001: control f
[5:07:32] harmless52: @LordOni 1
[5:07:39] harmless52: @velidien 1 󠀀
[5:07:44] Juicewolff: must have been busting
[5:07:47] minimi12001: have it macro'd into all my abilities
[5:07:51] velidien: like lust has to be a weirder keybind that wont accidentally get pressed right?
[5:08:03] noldan216: I miss Ventor
[5:08:03] velidien: @minimi12001 fucking chad, stay away from my girl
[5:08:04] Luna_Trashpanda: @velidien Not if you have restraint
[5:08:08] Juicewolff: lust is a click for me since vanilla
[5:08:08] Skunkjudge: gotta have the nuclear keys protecting lust
[5:08:17] Juicewolff: cant bind it with my mage brain
[5:08:22] minimi12001: have to make it easily pressable while not easy to press accidentally
[5:08:22] IAmSolari: I have lust on shift space so it feels like I'm pressing a super turbo button
[5:08:27] JMRG88: where is venthunt?
[5:08:34] velidien: @IAmSolari KEKW
[5:09:27] minimi12001: bro my guild got 6/9 tn and killed nymue in like 8 pulls, now we are wiping over and over to larry who weve killed 3 times already
[5:10:01] velidien: @minimi12001 sometimes people have offnights. best of luck though <3
[5:10:14] minimi12001: yea i dont need any larry drops the other mage is in im chillin
[5:10:19] minimi12001: i just wanna smack smoldy

[5:10:57] minimi12001: nymue just way easier than larry for us for some reason\
[5:11:23] FrabjousDaze: bald RageyBoom
[5:11:35] reedsworld: what happened to onlyfangs?
[5:11:36] mistr__p: Madge
[5:11:40] Valanya11: both breaths got turned away 0.5 seconds left
[5:11:48] Valanya11: and the cleave got parried
[5:11:54] Valanya11: we got mega lucky
[5:12:03] velidien: so is palworld going to get the big dick of pokemon suing them?
[5:12:20] SurfSalsa: @velidien probably
[5:12:23] Luna_Trashpanda: @velidien Not unless they copy the designs
[5:12:34] Valanya11: I got in 2 naxx runs, I got 2 piece t3 now
[5:12:36] IAmSolari: @velidien nah, they passed checks apparently
[5:12:51] Valanya11: and im IEA so im getting CTS prio EZ
[5:12:58] mistr__p: palworld = ark copy
[5:13:02] Luna_Trashpanda: I am pretty sure pokemon IP doesnt just cover general "monster/minion" gameplay
[5:13:16] VivaZebra: im tuning in is this it
[5:13:42] IAmSolari: @VivaZebra thank you for tuning in so they can now kill the boss
[5:13:55] VivaZebra: F
[5:13:59] VivaZebra: disappoint
[5:14:10] Skunkjudge: It's okay next pull, that one didn't count
[5:14:10] velidien: @VivaZebra you seem to be bad luck
[5:14:13] VivaZebra: NotLikeThis
[5:14:15] Myloozy: yo is that the death penalty guy
[5:14:19] Skunkjudge: stream delay so for all you know they already wiped
