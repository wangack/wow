[0:10:34] chestermcdwarf: until we hear an explanation, lets speculate wildly on why the names are concealed. I think its because um.... because ppl rly wanna be in hydras group, for the raw thrill of the spotlight, so he's denied them the exposure by adding some RESISTANCE to the equation
[0:11:24] nike_rise: @Hydramist should i send a boomy or rogue alt
[0:12:32] omgzorro_: so is it twisted faith > void plague now that we have mind spike?
[0:12:42] Samrych: what’s up with the name plates?😅
[0:12:51] omgzorro_: aaalrighty

[0:13:46] chestermcdwarf: lol wtf
[0:13:50] algroe: hey m8! do u think arcane dps is good or should i go fire dps in gnome.. cant see on any sites about arcane..
[0:13:57] flayqtt: melee hunter
[0:13:58] fakemejo: SP ->boomy -> ele  imo xd
[0:14:37] chestermcdwarf: we can deduce from the level of secrecy that this priest is in the witness protection program, has all his identifying details and associates hidden
[0:14:38] fakemejo: once ele gets their raiding gear they will rise
[0:14:43] thommy_brasco: i leveld a druid til 28 yday... im about to quit and start hunter or rog :D
[0:15:37] chestermcdwarf: maybe someone was DDOSing or somehow targetting his party members for something, so he had to hide them
[0:16:04] SvetiSlavi: Any updates of the PvP tier list?
[0:16:22] lilydigital: ive never properly pvp'd before but bloodmoon event looks fun, was gonna try rogue, should I just run SP instead if its dominating?
[0:16:58] SvetiSlavi: You just said also Shadow is King? any guide?
[0:17:02] lilydigital: cool, thanks for the advice ^.^

[0:25:13] genjimainofc: did u find a dispersion cancel macro that worked=?
[0:25:40] gratzitko: @JustOndore LMAO RLY?
[0:26:15] Lunaatj: If you can clear it fast enough to where you're close to hitting the lock out as 4.
[0:26:20] Lunaatj: Then as 4 is better, I assume.
[0:26:29] Annoulol: i just got dispersion and i had no problem at all just writing /cancelaura. But i saw the problem u had yesterday. Very wierd :D
[0:27:18] Annoulol: Can it be an addon or something
[0:27:20] gratzitko: alot of the runes seem to be buggy with macros, i cant make a macro for my haunt
[0:27:23] Annoulol: thats interfering somehow
[0:27:29] Annoulol: Glad u got it to work!
[0:27:38] gratzitko: is there a special way you have to make a macro for runes? cause /cast haunt doesnt work
[0:27:57] lundberg1998: @gratzitko  use the spell ID instead of name
[0:27:58] Lunaatj: Easy pumper logs
[0:28:03] Lunaatj: tell em a friend wants to come
[0:28:04] Lunaatj: ez kick
[0:28:05] piouspectre: damn....pumper prio
[0:28:19] Lunaatj: LMAO
[0:28:19] chestermcdwarf: "see man this guy Warlock C, we go waaay back, but man theres this guy Warlock D who really really looks appealing"
[0:28:29] gratzitko: @Lunaatj so what /cast 12345 basically?
[0:28:47] callie5: Its a dung, who cares about his logs, give hm a chance
[0:28:55] gratzitko: ^

[0:29:02] gratzitko: ight
[0:29:23] peestii: name leaked Kappa
[0:29:39] izzmai_laif: what weakaura or addon does he use for the runes on his portrait. looks sick.
[0:29:55] nv_xdd: issue is more like locks dont really contribute much to spellcleave, more worth to go with 3 mage all doing 250+ dps
[0:30:00] gratzitko: that doiesnt work @lundberg1998
[0:30:15] gratzitko: @Hydramist how do u make a macro for ur runes? like for instance mind spike
[0:30:23] gratzitko: like if you just wanted a /cast mind spike macro
[0:31:01] Lunaatj: Pog Man's feeling this group enough for the unboon.
[0:31:16] Annoulol: #showtooltip /cast [@mouseover,exists,nodead][]Legs Rune Ability
[0:31:16] gratzitko: they dont work for me >.< lkike /cast haunt dont work

[3:12:09] shiftbbg: like u could easily hit 400-500dps on a pull like that
[3:12:17] Mystiggo: I just hope they don't fuck spriest too hard with the death nerf
[3:12:24] Seilou: man they could have made a rune that increases ES stacks from 3 to 9 on belt but lowers healing by 10 % or something
[3:12:27] fattyjuicer: shadow being good will be tragic, 0 healers will xist
[3:12:29] fattyjuicer: exisr
[3:12:36] Deftvx: how do u feel about p2 pvp so far hydra? damage seems way too high rn cant even get healing casts off
[3:12:38] Dreameaterz: why force priests into one spec tho
[3:12:39] Mystiggo: Just reduce death dmg but transfer some power over to Mind Spike
[3:12:41] alschapwny: bro we need you in arena
[3:12:44] lolanrosie: is this eu priest or?

[3:18:38] Nyoxx: love to hear it. ended up playing warrior and im having a blast so far, runes make it smooth.
[3:19:11] ReykooTv: no pun intended
[3:19:23] BluntstepTV: yea i enjoyed warrior in p1, kinda looking forward to it after i hit 40 on priest
[3:19:36] Nyoxx: yeah ive heard a lot of doomers but man the class is just a monster in the right hands
[3:19:40] Mystiggo: most people enjoy warrior if it's op
[3:19:53] hiraethonhs: Nyoxx has right hands
[3:20:15] Dreameaterz: a mage who knows when to block gives me pain
[3:20:26] Nyoxx: it's funny that the seemingly most basic/fundamental classes can have the most depth
[3:20:27] Dreameaterz: predicting the death and blocking it is painfull ngl
[3:20:27] Mystiggo: yea mage has so many tools rn
[3:21:02] Nyoxx: how's everyone feeling about enh shaman? that's the next look for me

[5:48:50] Mystiggo: yea ppl yapping about spriest being op, meanwhile multiple classes doing 500-700 dps on that boss
[5:48:53] rektingator: Is that top dps hunter using pet?
[5:48:53] Mystiggo: where top priest is under 400
[5:49:17] notgarru: i mean i think its more the fact they're doing good damage while almost topping healing
[5:49:18] zakdennisatc: does twisted faith buff mind sear?
[5:49:23] vrsswow: for 99 logs on Elemental boss u need 240+
[5:50:15] vrsswow: check Details on Elemental boss and see what was your dps

[5:51:05] Unholy_john: Can you show your runes pls?
[5:51:06] notgarru: honestly are you sure about 240+ vrs? that sounds really low considering someone else said top was 385
[5:51:11] vrsswow: 371 dps right now is #1
[5:51:19] vrsswow: if some one is loggin this
[5:51:30] notgarru: supposedly the druid is logging
[5:51:35] bkuya: Ty, must be Destro with rune then :)
[5:51:37] Mystiggo: it's pretty common for 99 to be a fair bit below #1, I can see it
[5:51:53] whoiskha_: Do you think spriest gonna get nerfed?
[5:51:57] vrsswow: 302 is #1 atm if some one loggin Ryan will get world #1 as SP

[5:54:24] kinglourenco: mind sear seems pretty good
[5:54:57] Mystiggo: Sear isn't great on 3-4 mob pulls because it doesn't deal dmg to primary target
[5:55:00] MeerTwT: don’t forget to switch it before boss
[5:55:04] Mystiggo: but scales quickly the bigger pulls you do

[5:59:41] drishx: wtf
[5:59:43] kinglourenco: enhance dham doing 66 dps?
[5:59:50] Mystiggo: from what I hear: void plague is better if you can multidot, twisted faith is better if it's pure single target
[5:59:52] notgarru: @drishx he just wanted to give everyone else a shot
[5:59:58] Mystiggo: from spriest discord
[5:59:58] HeyImArty: They literally said they are speficially not making anything immune to bleed or diseases, because they dont wanna fuck classes / specs over
[6:00:02] vexxane: enha not looking too good :(

[6:01:34] Mystiggo: would explain top 3 not using VP
[6:01:47] notgarru: clutch or kick

[7:46:23] Fnyyf: in Phase 2 Melee needs to soak the Frost explosion together or it deals  like 5k pr char
[7:47:00] LoveStruck27: practice makes perfect, so the more you do the run the better it should get, as long  as people try to learn from it
[7:47:11] Revansoon: homies check
