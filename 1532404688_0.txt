[0:26:34] FeineeWildfireSirena: How long have the stream been on för?
[0:26:43] Cabbageman007: With Alpha so far ..seamless, does that point to a better Game is possible in Dec?
[0:26:48] Molvonos: Just started
[0:26:49] Thoreya: @lalelusa November
[0:26:50] Aspectt10: @FeineeWildfireSirena 26min
[0:27:13] Thoreya: I think they’re gonna try to push for a November release instead of December
[0:27:21] FeineeWildfireSirena: uhrg 1 hour intro left then..
[0:27:26] lalelusa: @Thoreya I won't get my hopium up for that XD
[0:27:54] Thoreya: I mean
[0:28:07] Thoreya: They have the dungeon logs in and the raid logs in already
[0:28:17] Thoreya: Journals rather
[0:29:23] Aspectt10: @lalelusa Ion said they started to develop dragonflight way before shadowlands came out so Im not suprised that it comes out this year
[0:29:40] lalelusa: @Thoreya November or December won't make a differnce for them earnings wise. 4th quarter report includes both Nov & Dec. Until yesterday I was team "won't release in 2022 at all"
[0:30:33] eazyyo_: expansion will drop in November
[0:30:37] Thoreya: @lalelusa for raid scheduling purposes I think Nov is a better time
[0:30:40] eazyyo_: calling it now
[0:30:50] Aspectt10: @Thoreya True
[0:30:55] lalelusa: @Aspectt10 I'm just worried about the quality. SL was delayed and still buggy. And since every expansion starts development about 4-5 years prior to release, well, I'll let myself be surprised
[0:31:00] BlueNile: ye, they need to consider everything: raids, etc
[0:31:21] lalelusa: @Thoreya we'll see. HYPE!
[0:31:29] Aspectt10: @lalelusa If you are sceptical just wait and see
[0:31:42] Aspectt10: Time will tell
[0:32:02] eazyyo_: @lalelusa they stopped developing SL early to Mke sure DF wasn't a mess. and DF had been in development for a while now
[0:32:05] lalelusa: the expansion drops when Towelliee says it drops :)
[0:32:26] squiffyk: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[0:32:55] Lesliech0w: i just wish DF came out when the Devs knew wtf they were doing xD
[0:33:07] GiiGa07: is stream over ?
[0:33:07] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[0:49:17] king0fpirates17: Is the new class fun so far?
[0:49:17] grandpa_seth91111: Does armor show up on the Dracthyr?
[0:49:27] Lesliech0w: do evoker talents come like DK talents did?
[0:49:38] Manabucho: wait RUIN is big damn
[0:49:39] Jokervenom1978: Nice we are gonna get a proper dragon fight again.
[0:49:45] GeT_LeNiN: @Towelliee Did you discus any PvP things?
[0:49:47] Tigerklaue: 8 bosses is great dont need more
[0:49:47] TheJetTV: TheJetTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:49:48] cabalish: + weapons/shield and trinkets on first 3 would be nice
[0:49:51] mayran01: can you use deviate delight in the dragon form and still fight and fly?
[0:49:57] Nomolock: Will they ever open up all races for all classes
[0:50:16] grimmy17: Yeah
[0:50:18] Qubilay: max healt or current healts?
[0:50:18] Manabucho: yes up to 20% more dmg i think
[0:50:25] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[0:50:28] mArcioo_: good for m+, kinda shit for raid. who care about p1
[0:50:29] EvilMalek: EvilMalek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[0:50:31] Infebdo: does that work on raid bosses, surely not?
[0:50:32] flushjay: HeyGuys
[0:50:34] Lesliech0w: such a mistake to only have draks as evokers on launch xD
[0:50:35] smward87: only shoulders and belts. as part of their customization you can wear other parts of armor, most people so far just keep them naked lol @grandpa_seth91111
[0:50:36] grimmy17: @Manateedk Scales with mastery so 20% is just the base
[0:50:36] Manabucho: nvm damn cant wait to play this
[0:50:52] ShadoodHD: i'm also interested in mixing mythic+ and older dungeons, might need a tweak or 2 to make it more easy
[0:51:05] Manabucho: @grimmy17 yeah realised it from the tool tip, cant wait to play this class
[0:51:10] Kaype92: No more flasks in dragonflight??
[0:51:28] grimmy17: Just means deep breath is fully mastery capped for the big AoE
[0:51:31] deadalon: The more I see of Dragonflight... the less interested I have in it...  WOW is just outdated by now on so many fronts
[0:51:49] mArcioo_: it is. basically anger management from warri
[0:52:10] Tigerklaue: @ShadoodHD shouldnt be a problem cause alot are testing it on the ptr
[0:52:27] asanjawa: @deadalon the difference between old WoW and Dragonflight is actually insane I see that yeah. I hope the older parts are updated
[0:52:31] parasKamu: so u do dmg with blue and red magic?
[0:52:35] Ribastur0075: Raid Specc would be Full Blue Right?
[0:52:44] miasmuhh: healer spec feels way more interesting than dps spec imo
[0:52:46] Hxlst_: I feel like, not having a melee evoker spec is a missed opportunity
[0:52:46] xraynibba: @deadalon if your that disinterested why not go watch something that peaks your interest
[0:52:48] DoubleNova: it's bare bones?
[0:52:51] StraightErro: @Towelliee with the elemental focus of the expac so far, and the Incarnates being elemental bosses, think Ragnaros or Al'akir or someone might make a surprise appearance later in?
[0:52:54] GiiGa07: Do you believe many people will main evoker ?
[0:52:56] gdtomii: Evoker DPS talents are incredibly boring so far, just flat % damage increases
[0:52:57] Ribastur0075: DH of caster
[0:53:17] Rudric_Ice: i think evoker doesn't do really good single target dmg
[0:53:19] ShadoodHD: @Tigerklaue true, but it can be hit or miss depending on the amount of testing, especially with how much stats changed over time
[0:53:20] Syghtless: What? evoker has so much stuff, so much utility
[0:53:22] RagingPunk: guild wars 2 has a good amount
[0:53:24] Lesliech0w: talent revamp, in general, are % nodes lol
[0:53:32] deadalon: @xraynibba Ye - I'm going. :) Plenty of quality games out now.
[0:53:40] akuma_46: hey do we have a chance to get alpha or this is for streamers only?
[0:53:40] Elff11: Ooh thats smart
[0:53:42] gdtomii: evoker healer talents are bangers tho
[0:53:50] ShadoodHD: @Tigerklaue still excited though :D
[0:53:52] gdtomii: so many possibilities
[0:53:53] Tigerklaue: they feedback on the dk is great directly did the changes people asked for
[0:53:57] asanjawa: @straighterro They are dead
[0:53:59] gmh00: Spriest still shafted
[0:54:10] teatimetox: especially the 500 mount achievement was surprised how fast they said we will change
[0:54:14] EscapePlan01: are you glad the 500 mount reward is changing?
[0:54:16] Lesliech0w: fuckin survival talents lol
[0:54:19] Kyrrua: how about reacting to feedback from classic wow community ? LUL
[0:54:22] akia03: so there is still hope for the hunter talents
[0:54:22] Alexkayzz: No new music in zones yet? @Towelliee
[0:54:23] Nebulizer87: I’ll take streamlined w/o button bloat
[0:54:45] enigma7767: it kinda feels like an apology expansion, essentially did not follow any feedback in SL and now they are trying to reverse.
[0:54:46] bjorne42: Are addons allowed?
[0:54:48] ShadoodHD: are you able to go outside the zone? just curious :p
[0:54:49] ohnomyvirgineyes: oribos!!!!
[0:54:52] StraightErro: @asanjawa Nothing ever seems to stay dead in wow, especially if we get access to the bronze dragonflight
[0:54:54] Nostoroth: some m+ maybe
[0:54:57] TweektheProphet: @Towelliee do you think with how fast they are reacting that they actully might be ready to launch they just want to get feedback for changes that need to be made
[0:55:01] sheerheartattackyk: more warlus people in dragonflight?
[0:55:05] Fumhi: can you get alpha if you havent pre-purchased DF yet?
[0:55:10] GermanManlyMan: i level up all the tanks, then i pick the meta lord at release, easy success
[0:55:10] gdtomii: WoW OST will always deliver at peak quality, never has disappointed
[0:55:11] Tinie_priest: Does the evoker gameplay feel very unique? Or is it similar to some other class ?
[0:55:15] maskedboy999: @milksupply0  what u mean for shafted
[0:55:17] Lesliech0w: legit, if they had released DF after MoP, I'd have hope, buuuut
[0:55:21] littlebaoboy: @Towelliee first impressions?
[0:55:21] oTOKEo: @enigma7767 weird, its like a business is tryin to make it right after their wrong....
[0:55:21] warrenny: @tano_cosplay For sure
[0:55:42] SphinxyOCE: i can't wait to see the dungeons whenever they open them up
[0:55:52] elandura: I got my first alpha invitation after 12 years of playing.
[0:55:52] fastboy42069: whats with the weird pitch shfted music?
[0:55:59] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Running to Dunkin Donuts @towelliee Need a coffee???
[0:56:15] enigma7767: @oTOKEo no one said it was a bad thing. Its needed, if we had another expack where all feedback was ignored we would be worse off than the beginning of SL.
[0:56:19] Elseworldz: Been playing since BC and I've never been in an alpha or beta, but at least I get to watch.
[0:56:26] grylz89: these casted abilityhs remind me of league of legends casts
[0:56:27] chaosweaver69: this evoker class seems incredibly boring imo
[0:56:37] Taaliaaaa: the new ui stuff looks dope as shit
[0:56:39] TweektheProphet: @warrenny it seems like it to me
[0:56:40] parasKamu: would be cooler if abilitys would have more wow effect and particles
[0:56:52] asanjawa: @grylz89 smite actually
[0:56:53] zysmos: I feel like they should add old dungeons in later season, it would be better to let people discover new dungeons and then add old ones in the rotation imo
[0:56:53] Darwoo: how long alpha been live?
[0:57:06] Kaype92: Some of these phials are… very interestinf
[0:57:09] grylz89: @asanjawa truu
[0:57:09] Kaype92: Interesting
[0:57:10] magicclicker: lol
[0:57:11] elandura: 2-3 days at best maybe
[0:57:17] Alexkayzz: Can you even kill eachother with those huge heals? LUL
[0:57:19] Respls: what happens if you just soar and leave him hanging
[0:57:21] Lesliech0w: DF needed other classes as Dragons at launch

[0:57:50] genjosanso: @Towelliee is it me, but i can not see the clock on the minimap. Did you remove it?
[0:57:53] tebbix: what was that
[0:58:00] ShadoodHD: holy pally duel 2.0 towPog
[0:58:12] Feilprodusert: @genjosanso its up there in the corner :D
[0:58:17] chaosweaver69: @genjosanso its literally in the top right
[0:58:17] illidony: @genjosanso above the map
[0:58:18] Taaliaaaa: @genjosanso its above the minimap
[0:58:23] tebbix: one shot lol
[0:58:24] KaisenSiru: Alpha Pog
[0:58:28] Elseworldz: @ShadoodHD Yeah ff14 is like that. Nooo thanks.
[0:58:29] sheerheartattackyk: i hope you can customize dracthyr to be more bifier, dunno why blizz keep making skinny characters
[0:58:35] bankssi: This music is pog
[0:58:48] Laklin1: talent that stores healing done into damage
[0:58:49] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee does evoker have a ranged interrupt besides the knockback?
[0:58:58] teatimetox: with there  being over 100+ tuskar do you think allied races will be coming??
[0:59:01] grimmy17: @Ooshraxa ye
[0:59:02] Syghtless: talent in the generic tree, buffs damage depending on healing
[0:59:05] AureliusXV: hisn living flame gets a buff after healing himslef
[0:59:08] grimmy17: 20sec CD counterspell
[0:59:11] teatimetox: 100+ different models that is
[0:59:12] ShadoodHD: @ShadoodHD there are options to turn other players off, but for wow is yikes towCringe
[0:59:17] tebbix: that is broken lol
[0:59:39] Taaliaaaa: that is getting nerfed
[1:00:00] grimmy17: It's not that broken, the raid ST build barely casts living flame

[1:01:21] Gravity16: loving the new zone?
[1:01:24] Gaelama: Have to give them credit for listening and acting on feedback, it somewhat feels less effective when they've promised to be like this a couple of times before. Fingers crossed that they keep this energy going though

[1:02:21] xraynibba: @Towelliee judging from a early POV would you say this zone has alot of quests to offer?
[1:02:24] teatimetox: the wings looks awesome
[1:02:36] Rudric_Ice: not gonna lie but the visage forms for dracthyr looks really bad
[1:02:47] gmh00: Tried soar? Looks so much fun

[1:08:30] CloudPants8081: FortHype
[1:09:10] Atticon: So many people seem to like the dracthyr but I still find their proportions discomfiting. Heads way too small, torso too long.
[1:09:14] RishTheMage: evoker finally has a tank spec?
[1:09:18] xraynibba: hope all you bois are doing good this morning
[1:09:39] Thoreya: @xraynibba yup tgif

[1:10:11] Nicoz971: Still no paladin talent tree ?
[1:10:21] Thoreya: cdew was saying ln evoker healer in arena may not be that good bc it can only be 25 yards away
[1:10:26] Thoreya: as opposed to 40, so we'll see
[1:10:32] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Rudric_Ice go human female

[1:14:29] Kickack: ping

[1:16:03] Thoreya: @cazhually hunter druid rogue priest dk available also
[1:16:04] Algfader: "Our captains' a tuskar!?...  our captain's a tuskar.. meh.."

[1:16:12] MadKingCraig: Guys I'm coming back to wow. What is the add on manager everyone uses now?
[1:16:14] shadowgrove88: thats the base wow ui now
[1:16:26] Orion280: one of the houses lmao im sorry
[1:16:27] Jimstur: This zone should have the ZG Magic Water Kappa
[1:16:27] Tigerklaue: first zone looks alot like borean tundra
[1:16:28] nephttv_: @MadKingCraig probably curse
[1:16:30] Rabiahtaro132: Good morning Towlliee and Chat
[1:16:30] Lataran: will nameplates also get a change?
[1:16:30] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee it said in the quest text who sells them
[1:16:32] Orion280: i saw someone buy it
[1:16:35] NexusOps: man, for a second I thought you were playing WoTLK
[1:16:57] Meliea_EU: @MadKingCraig the light version of the curseforge bloat
[1:17:16] CloudPants8081: xp bar down there now?
[1:17:16] Vilkanog: Is there gonna be an option to use the old ui health bar for example? I hate the new bar
[1:17:16] Zanmato01: you can fly at the start of the expansion?
[1:17:19] euhunttu: @Towelliee Everything looks good so far what ive seen in DF but Ion said in Preach interview that we have the option to pull the ripcord and it took them a YEAR to do it so i'm not buying that "we listen to our community" bullshit anymore!
[1:17:25] nephttv_: Ive sent a total of 50 tickets to blizz trying to get into alpha, So far all I have gotten is hate mail from Ion
[1:17:26] akia03: omg the new bunny model is adorable hopefully its a beast not a critter
[1:17:31] Diggasen: @Zanmato01 yes
[1:17:34] Syghtless: haha did they make taliesin a tuskarr in the game
[1:17:41] Diggasen: @Zanmato01 Dragonriding
[1:17:47] Jimstur: @lataran in the reveal blizz did 2 months ago the nameplates were different. I guess they just did not put it inthe alpha yet, but it should be coming
[1:17:48] Algfader: What is Towelliees take on wotlk release? (want to know since he was spot on with alpha)
[1:17:56] euhunttu: @Towelliee I hope so too bro
[1:17:58] Kickack: SpeedBall?
[1:17:58] akia03: the new beaver pet is wierd tho
[1:18:00] NexusOps: @MadKingCraig I was in the exact same situation few days ago. WowUp seems to be dead due to access issues. Long story short CurseForge Alpha client is a standalone client without the Overwolf nonsense
[1:18:09] Lataran: @Jimstur alrgiht thanks
[1:18:18] gdtomii: im so hyped for Wrath tbh

[1:18:36] aladinsane444: What pieces of armor can dracthyr wear/transmog?
[1:18:38] MadKingCraig: @NexusOps Yeah I noticed wowup was missing a lot.. Thanks.
[1:18:46] raynestormfur: @aladinsane444 mail
[1:18:50] coldhandsbeatz: I think having wrath classic and dragonflight come that close is a mistake. Wrath probably september and DF prepatch probably november
[1:18:53] Thoreya: 4 months?! i feel like SL and BC was like 2month s lol
[1:18:58] Subjektive: toe jam

[1:19:24] Nachozdood: Toejam better have a buddy named earl
[1:19:26] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee Look for Earl!
[1:19:37] Helios_a: oh nice the alpha
[1:19:38] Funderik: @euhunttu difference is, there's nothing in DF that needs a rip cord either. it's just a game it's not this deep, either play have fun or go somewhere else.,
[1:19:40] Ooshraxa: played the shit out of that game
[1:19:55] Jimstur: Earl? my finger is on the button
[1:19:57] Subjektive: freaking loved that game when i was a kid
[1:20:02] itjustfeelsright: dont you remember the game back in the 90s named toejam and earl?
[1:20:03] lalelusa: Toejam? XD

[1:20:06] futomara01: @Towelliee what spec would you say is closest the same to evoker dps rotation?
[1:20:09] brawlcuttt: final boss confirmed Kappa
[1:20:12] havenbirch: DF seems like a big improvement
[1:20:22] Algfader: I'm so gonna name my son Toejam
[1:20:25] gaminglazytitan: @Towelliee he gonna be the end game raid boss kekw
[1:20:29] swags67: Haha toe jam and earl. That sega game was legit
[1:20:32] euhunttu: @Funderik Guess you miss the point
[1:20:34] Birder_L: @Towelliee is the higer view distam
[1:20:35] Takaoni7: Toejam the chad
[1:20:42] Birder_L: distance in yet
[1:20:50] brawlcuttt: what about dungeons ?
[1:20:50] Bobthedeathsmith: so right now what does the end game content look like? Is it just raids right now? is there any open world activities yet?
[1:20:59] Ety_TV: who will be the BIG bad in DF?
[1:21:02] Tigerklaue: isnt one raid boss missing in the guide?
[1:21:08] Jimstur: @Towelliee you gonna team up with Terry again for a marathon when the game launches?
[1:21:09] chabouy: What tanks have you tried so far?

[1:21:28] aladinsane444: Brightwing will be the end boss of df
[1:21:30] strike879: hope they do less bosses per raid but more raids total and faster
[1:21:33] Molvonos: There are an assload of the timetrials
[1:21:40] Molvonos: According to the achieve strings datamined
[1:21:41] brawlcuttt: are you able to check dungeon bosses on adventure guide for upcomming dungeons or ?

[1:21:48] Whoz: good will hunting ariW
[1:21:49] Funderik: @euhunttu i got your point clearly, but you missed the last 7 months of them listening and used unrelated/old arguments that don't apply right now.
[1:21:51] Araphas: @strike879 agreed
[1:21:56] Thoreya: @hellkrue ya they have dungeons and raid in journal
[1:22:02] George2001k: @towelliee basically you can fly most of the time between quests?
[1:22:08] kutlus91: are they letting us have flying from the start?
[1:22:09] Rabiahtaro132: There has to be some achievement reward for getting gold in all of them.
[1:22:14] brawlcuttt: @Thoreya Alrighty, ty  :D
[1:22:17] Aquadriel: these mini speed things remind me of Ori 2,has a similar thing over the world. really fun extra minigame to fuck around

[1:23:41] specialkidmiles: Have you slept since Alpha came out?
[1:23:55] nietschy: can older dragon mounts also do the dragon flying thing?

[1:24:16] Akselky: your normal wings
[1:24:18] Infebdo: he means ur dracthyr wings
[1:24:19] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee not that, the red wings on your character
[1:24:25] Lupusdeus: think he meant when u'r in dracthyr form
[1:24:28] thetoddfather1990: i like the new action bars
[1:24:30] rbayduden: think he means when you are on the ground
[1:24:32] captiv8: No your wings on you character
[1:24:34] Voidheim: so there is now a default setting for combining all bags into one bag now?
[1:24:41] akia03: hmm would be cool if vial of sands lets you use dragonriding stuff
[1:24:43] Tigerklaue: they should add races against other player would be so much fun
[1:24:49] funnyc4t: Is this new UI or addons?
[1:24:51] Rudric_Ice: DH in shambles after seeing the dracthyr flying racial KEKW

[1:25:21] specialkidmiles: that would be sick
[1:25:21] ShadoodHD: i mean slootHmm
[1:25:21] TheWouze: @Towelliee They could make it like forza, where u race against your friends ghosts
[1:25:30] BubblePriest: racing a Witch during halloween event
[1:25:33] Aquadriel: but inmario kart you see them and colide with t hem.
[1:25:36] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee i meant why are your character wings glowing red not the mount ones
[1:25:41] Aquadriel: Trackmania does the ghost thing and is awesome
[1:25:41] rbayduden: Alterac valley, 40 vs 40 FLYING combat
[1:25:44] Cabbageman007: Alpha seems Seemless..Does that Inspire Hope for a Better Early Launch?
[1:25:44] Rabiahtaro132: It would be cool if you could set up your own races and rings.
[1:25:46] TheWouze: @Towelliee And its against their best times
[1:25:51] MrKimab: !yt
[1:25:51] Moobot: @MrKimab Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW Editable UI System - DRAGONFLIGHT ALPHA EXCLUSIVE youtu.be/jst2FvVYB00

[1:26:13] Thoreya: zone is giga huge
[1:26:16] Lataran: i love the new zone
[1:26:16] K0rzak0v: It is huge
[1:26:19] DecayedmiNt: This zone is one of the largest in game
[1:26:20] Zettabyte: Contentium
[1:26:22] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee i meant why are your character wings glowing red not the mount ones
[1:26:23] Xel_n_Hell: what's the evokers rotation like atm?
[1:26:25] Thoreya: i hope when u hit max lvl this zone turns into a playground
[1:26:26] specialkidmiles: Vanilla zone is music to my ears Towellee
[1:26:26] Thoreya: like ZM
[1:26:29] Cristiex2012: at least we can see the zone while flying, unlike shadowlands :/
[1:26:29] K0rzak0v: And I love the vibes
[1:26:29] BrothaLatinoHeat76: I hope you have the option in the future to change the "glow" that comes out... Imagine adding different colors possibly based on your dragon's color
[1:26:30] Tigerklaue: world quest everywhere LUL

[1:26:42] marshall_madness666: so gw2 with a wow skin kinda thing
[1:26:44] Fierced: @Xel_n_Hell depends on if youre speccing blue evoker or red evoker.
[1:26:45] BubblePriest: honestly flightpaths need to be longer than water refill, but shorter than a shit
[1:26:53] swinging_monk: Are they letting lvl 70 or is there a lower cap?
[1:26:56] Nicoz971: Dont make it convoluted too much
[1:27:00] Poxx26: dragon flight has to be carried into future xpacs imo @Towelliee
[1:27:02] nietschy: can the old nether drakes also do the dragon flying?
[1:27:08] TweektheProphet: @Towelliee we haven't seen any bonus objectives or world quest yet right?
[1:27:08] Googen: they said they wanted to have empty space tho
[1:27:14] TheWouze: havent they made it empty to make it more classic
[1:27:16] Akselky: emptyness helps things feel bigger
[1:27:20] wyman1990vc: dude I got so lucky was able to reserve desthwing, and Smaug on my server
[1:27:20] rbayduden: cap is 68 i think
[1:27:22] Lupusdeus: @Poxx26 yeah the mechanic at least, if not only dragons
[1:27:24] TheMooney: I like the empty space tbh from my own flying around
[1:27:25] Fragglevision: oh, they gon' fill it out
[1:27:25] ShadoodHD: kinda excited for the rest of the zone ngl
[1:27:26] jump_plx: I really hope not, I prefer big empty space zones
[1:27:28] moltencrucible: @Towelliee at what level did you start? does levelling feels smooth?
[1:27:33] Sagyi: i like having empty spaces. the few past expansions felt way to crowded
[1:27:34] Kale_Nd: Guess no answer to why the wings glow...
[1:27:42] Bogzeh: and enable it in all zones
[1:27:43] Fleymour: dragonriding for old expansions too
[1:27:43] Xel_n_Hell: @Fierced fair, is there a hybrid blue and red dmg possibility?
[1:27:51] Narzilx: next expansion they're copy pasting other gw2 mounts hopefully and not only dragonriding
[1:27:54] aladinsane444: Song?
[1:28:00] Nachozdood: dragon riding will be carried over with the silly dragon race
[1:28:02] raynestormfur: @Kale_Nd he did answer...
[1:28:03] ShadoodHD: i also like how focused they are with 1 zone/area instead of the entire expansion like shadowlands and bfa
[1:28:12] Bjorns1: he answered @kale_nd
[1:28:15] tuttalama12: Is that the zone soundtrack ?
[1:28:16] K0rzak0v: Is this game music or playlist
[1:28:19] tuttalama12: No ok
[1:28:25] euhunttu: LUL
[1:28:27] geokouts: ded, d e d , ded

[1:28:31] VezuviusGT: F
[1:28:32] magicclicker: LUL
[1:28:38] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Definitely can see them possibly adding flight courses in old world content...
[1:28:39] fewyn: this is why i can't play non-tank classes now
[1:28:46] TheNeighborhoodOtaku: TheNeighborhoodOtaku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 85 months! Cheers to another month. Tentatively hype for Dragonflight. The potential is 100% there.
[1:28:46] euhunttu: @Towelliee I thought they were OP atm!
[1:28:50] Cristiex2012: What mount was that while you were dead? @Towelliee
[1:28:51] Rabiahtaro132: it would be cool if for future expansions, even if we don't get flying right away, we got to choose between doing regular flying and dragon riding.
[1:28:57] Tigerklaue: questing as tank just pull the whole area
[1:28:58] xquestie: @Towelliee Can you show the azeroth map?
[1:29:02] xHILDAx: I just swapped back from healer and dps to tank because of the pull problem :p
[1:29:05] Meliea_EU: curious about the soundtrack too, but music was always amazing
[1:29:16] Syghtless: so the plan seems to be in 5 weeks are zones are availible
[1:29:16] Rygothx: It would be nice if this race can play as a tank. Not asking for another tank class.
[1:29:17] Ozolz: it seems like dracthys has alot of mobility, is that correct?
[1:29:18] Kisswani: @Towelliee what's the DPS cooldown for Evoker ?
[1:29:19] lalelusa: nottankthyr
[1:29:19] akia03: does it play like a mage?
[1:29:23] Nachozdood: was that a cast time to drink a flask or w/e they call it now?
[1:29:27] akiimbo_sliice: what weapons can they use.?
[1:29:33] TheMooney: btw I found you can upgrade all ur gear to 306 in oribos lol
[1:29:33] moltencrucible: @Towelliee at what level did you start? does levelling feels smooth?
[1:29:43] Fierced: @akia03 if you go full blue spec you have like 1 cast
[1:29:44] GeT_LeNiN: realy cool looking spells
[1:29:45] DarkOnyx7: would be cool if they could add more specs to existing classes in a future xpac
[1:29:50] Fierced: why do stars constantly show up
[1:29:50] furiousduckling: Whats their AOE Cap like?
[1:29:55] Lobcityclipps32: That’s literally a mage
[1:30:08] Lupusdeus: an aura then?
[1:30:10] Rudric_Ice: its a DH mage
[1:30:12] wetterspitze: what class is this? :)
[1:30:13] Fierced: @furiousduckling 8 target cleave on blue version, uncapped on red, but red is a dot based spec
[1:30:13] Pwnoqraphy: do you think its hard to play?^^
[1:30:15] Syghtless: prolonged power pot returns!
[1:30:28] argonia_: any new professions

[1:30:34] furiousduckling: @Fierced cheers bro <3
[1:30:35] Aronim1980: How is the Evoker so far?
[1:30:37] Rabiahtaro132: @juckfrump 65 for testing zone content.
[1:30:38] Fierced: @VezuviusGT no
[1:30:45] Nachozdood: is there a reason to staying in dragon form or is it like worgen and swaps you back when you enter combat?
[1:30:47] Warcraftthor: Warcraftthor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! I wish they were tanks too.
[1:30:47] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Racoe To Lv 70 Alpha?
[1:30:47] StarbuckTech: from the little game play I have seen... it looks fun
[1:30:51] BrothaLatinoHeat76: LOL
[1:30:52] specialkidmiles: I saw someone say DH Ele shaman baby
[1:30:54] Timothious: This a new class?
[1:30:54] Fleymour: thinking back.. how long was legion / bfa / sl alpha ? @Towelliee
[1:31:01] Van_Klinken: Wow that spell is cool
[1:31:03] moltencrucible: @Rabiahtaro132 thank you!
[1:31:09] Fleymour: @Timothious HUH
[1:31:13] VezuviusGT: Mail then?
[1:31:19] Kisswani: damn
[1:31:23] raynestormfur: @VezuviusGT yep
[1:31:25] StarbuckTech: that healing as a tank WTF
[1:31:25] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I think if you stay in the circle of your Firestorm, you get healed or something happens
[1:31:30] Timothious: just got herer whats with that reply
[1:31:31] Fierced: @VezuviusGT yep, as they said when they announced it
[1:31:33] Miklagart: removed
[1:31:40] Algfader: "I wish I was a little bit tanker, not such a wanker, wish I had some def with  a shield I would spanker"
[1:31:45] NickyNiclas: Do both specs use intellect as the main stat?
[1:31:49] Tigerklaue: @Nachozdood same as worgen
[1:31:52] Vilkanog: Fun detected LUL
[1:31:54] Fierced: @kimmo_gaming firestorm doesnt heal
[1:31:57] Lupusdeus: @Fleymour shortest alpha to launch timeframe was 188 days for mists, this will be the shortest at around 150-160 dYA
[1:31:59] Eregbueye: can you fight in human form ?
[1:32:01] Fleymour: @VezuviusGT dragons has scales.. mail armor is made out of scales.. make sense naowhHmm
[1:32:03] MaleFrom73: does the devestation evoker feel squishy in pve?
[1:32:07] VezuviusGT: i was bathing my fish so... missed it
[1:32:18] Fierced: Can you actually/
[1:32:20] captiv8: The self healing and the damage from the talent are going to be nerf’d so damn hard
[1:32:21] Fierced: show please
[1:32:29] Rudric_Ice: @Eregbueye  no only certain abilties
[1:32:38] ColdIceCreamMan: only a few abilities. some abilities transform you into dragon
[1:32:38] Fleymour: @Lupusdeus i ment not duration of alpha i mean the time before release ish :D
[1:32:44] Fleymour: @Lupusdeus but thanks :)
[1:32:45] Bogzeh: dont think u can? i saw some spells just put u in dragon form
[1:32:45] VezuviusGT: so this is a Mail-wearing
[1:32:58] KaisenSiru: New furbolgs?!
[1:33:21] Kelsillium: The more I watch Evoker gameplay the more I wonder could they have made this a half ground, half flight playstyle. Like in dungeons if you could fly about 30 feet from the ground and rain destruction down but you would still pull mobs if you attempted to fly over them.
[1:33:24] Timothious: can heal too
[1:33:26] CloudPants8081: nameplates looks nice
[1:33:27] Nachozdood: XD this is just fancy shaman
[1:33:32] PlagueHit: Chat is frozen?
[1:33:32] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[1:33:34] Tigerklaue: 25 is so short
[1:33:44] VezuviusGT: so these are mail-wearing pumped mages?
[1:33:44] BrothaLatinoHeat76: That's like people playing Worgens... Why would you want to play in human / vestiage form...
[1:33:55] danielthegathering: i hate the new castbar
[1:33:55] akia03: wouldnt that make them easy to kite for full range specs
[1:33:56] Lupusdeus: @Fleymour ah ok, well the timeframe i gave includes beta and prepatch etc, so this ewill basically be the shortest everything in terms of time
[1:33:59] tornbraclet: here is a helpful tip the nameplates show up at 20
[1:34:02] NickyNiclas: 25 for heals too?
[1:34:03] Kale_Nd: @StadiaProPants the nameplates are the same we have now, no change yet
[1:34:05] whyabadi: Lacks a spamable dot it seems?
[1:34:11] Rabiahtaro132: Evoker looks more medium ranged.
[1:34:18] Stiffy84: what lvl will tbey start at?
[1:34:26] nisuunlite: can you change size and location of cast bar? @Towelliee
[1:34:28] Fierced: @whyabadi whats the point of a spammable dot???
[1:34:29] Lupusdeus: is the UI fully moveable etc right now @Towelliee
[1:34:38] Kisswani: @Stiffy1984 58
[1:34:40] whyabadi: @Fierced Multi dotting
[1:34:43] Rabiahtaro132: oh damn.
[1:34:43] Mensias: they added wings to races now? what a garbage choice
[1:34:48] Silverwards: this may be the shrotest alpha/beta cycle but from what Ion was saying yesterday, it's also the most focused and structured alpha/beta cylce
[1:34:53] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Hey @towelliee Don't forget... Shammy tanks... I am sure someone will figure a way to create a tanking spec in the envoker spec ;) They always do...
[1:34:54] thunder993: root is 50 I think?
[1:34:55] Stiffy84: @kisswani ty
[1:34:56] ColdIceCreamMan: @whyabadi thankfully no dots
[1:34:58] Dankind64: Is the healer also medium range?
[1:35:00] CloudPants8081: @StadiaProPants the target nameplates looks likes it changes abit
[1:35:05] Fierced: @whyabadi you do know that the only dot they have, aside from the weak dot on their st filler. is AoE right?
[1:35:08] kenshamrock4: How does the class feel?
[1:35:10] lightswinter: any improvement so far?
[1:35:10] akia03: how are there gap closeres?
[1:35:21] EASanDiego: do you think they'll let drakthyr be other classes eventually? @Towelliee
[1:35:22] HumanXII: @Towelliee i like the all think but i dont like the Dragon style class like is so old style to put dragon class is so idk boring?? ...what you think about this class? you like it? the idea
[1:35:29] Fierced: @whyabadi only dot is flame breath, and its a aoe so idk what youre on about
[1:35:36] BrothaLatinoHeat76: It almost looks like and has a feel of if you merged a mage and a demon hunter...
[1:35:53] Nachozdood: @ayybelmao i hope not there will be no reason to be any other race
[1:35:54] paddystar11: kinda interesting, evoker seems like the first hypermobile ranged. Before Beastmastery hunter was the mobility "god", but rly he only could cast while running lol
[1:35:56] whyabadi: @Fierced Firestorm? Yeah, I was just asking if they have a single target dot without cooldown like Shadow Word: Pain, Moonfire....etc
[1:35:57] Fierced: @ayybelmao no
[1:36:01] Kisswani: @Towelliee what does their mastery do for evoker ?
[1:36:04] Mensias: so sad to see wow going down tihs path
[1:36:15] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Dracthyr Hunter FTW!!!
[1:36:18] Rudric_Ice: the evoker looks fine but its not gonna replace my main that is warrior
[1:36:20] tigzie: agree toewl
[1:36:21] Tigerklaue: everyone would switch
[1:36:21] Qubilay: and why is that?
[1:36:24] DeanoTV: @Mensias what path? FailFish
[1:36:24] Voidheim: yeah, kinda like now that they finally get to leave the Dragon Isles they can learn other classses
[1:36:25] tigzie: towel*
[1:36:25] Ramzilla92: just hope you can cut the wings off then xD
[1:36:27] Rabiahtaro132: A drakthyr warrior would be bad ass.
[1:36:27] Molvonos: @Mensias ????
[1:36:28] manmower: dracthyr racials might have to be tuned down if they did that
[1:36:28] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Also Dracthyr Shammies ;(
[1:36:31] Van_Klinken: @Mensias What path?
[1:36:32] Lupusdeus: @Mensias what path? playable dragons?
[1:36:33] chubahi: @Kisswani  increases dmg done
[1:36:36] Kelsillium: Based on damage numbers here, and the fact there is no borrowed power, what are we predicting damage numbers to be at near the end of the expansion?
[1:36:37] Subjektive: dracthyr have been hidden for 10,000 years they gotta learn new classes
[1:36:39] EASanDiego: dracthyr death knight!
[1:36:40] LakuClap: double jump and glide on all classes sounds op af
[1:36:40] Timothious: how many specs does it have
[1:36:42] Fierced: @whyabadi firestorm isnt a dot, and its a AoE ability thats on the ground that just does x damage during its full duration. not a dot.
[1:36:44] Boosti661: I mean dh is still two races 3 expacs later
[1:36:48] Voidheim: @Ramzilla92 crreamWtf
[1:36:49] sphjk: that stats are huge
[1:36:53] aladinsane444: Dracthyr demon hunter
[1:36:54] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Major tuning will be done between now and release...
[1:36:54] sphjk: 300 stamine
[1:36:54] fewyn: yuge
[1:36:58] Kisswani: @subailin I see , thx for the reply
[1:37:02] DeanoTV: if u hate WoW why u here? FailFish
[1:37:03] Mensias: Yes starting to feel more like a Mobile game tbh
[1:37:04] JudgementRET: So whats the story in the first zone, what are the general main story quest line based on?
[1:37:06] Molvonos: @LakuClap Dracthyr dont get a double jump.  It's just a single jump + autoglide
[1:37:09] uncivil82: @Towelliee you think the colts will be any good this year
[1:37:22] MTCason: @Mensias In what way does it feel like a mobile game?
[1:37:22] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100631756-15027263 towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[1:37:27] Molvonos: @Mensias How in the world do you equate this to mobile out of curiosity?
[1:37:33] the_viznar: @Mensias what??? actual???
[1:37:36] whyabadi: @Fierced I stand corrected. So I guess it's not going to be a multi-dot class.
[1:37:40] lightswinter: hoping wow to improve but disappointing ever time LUL
[1:37:40] manmower: with evokers out, what is the point of bringing mager to groups and raids?
[1:37:47] Zr0_gg: Hopefully I can move cast bar position in the customization. That's an awkward spot.
[1:37:47] TheCountMST: Not sure if it's been said - iLevel Upgrade Vendor in Oribos offers free upgrades for all gear to 306
[1:37:49] Lupusdeus: @Towelliee u heard that Andrew Luck stroy podcast from the athletic, really worth a listen man
[1:37:51] Fierced: @whyabadi ill whisper
[1:37:55] Qoax: This is what Guardian druid should look like 😀
[1:37:55] adeekoowy: Main evoker stat is int/mastery?
[1:37:57] Xeron_159: does it have a slow ability?
[1:38:02] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Glad there isn't a stat squish... :)
[1:38:14] Molvonos: @manmower Mages do different kinds of damage and have different utility.  It'd be like comparing Mage to Warlock.
[1:38:14] amrazzjosh: Morning 🌄
[1:38:18] Mensias: @Molvonos the art, the class design, the animations/movements it's not how wow used to be. hope wotlk is good
[1:38:19] nisuunlite: @Zr0_gg was wondering same thing
[1:38:23] bigbutteredbeans: How’s the TTK on this class versus other classes on alpha? @towelliee
[1:38:28] Rudric_Ice: evoker needs more single target dps
[1:38:34] silodin: They are going to change the 500 mount achievement reward!! legendary!
[1:38:37] ArcaneSyntax: I'm kinda sad that there's no new talent trees outside of the Dracthyr this week.
[1:38:38] MTCason: @Mensias It feels more WoW than a lot of expansions have.
[1:38:46] Rabiahtaro132: Do you think we will see a lot more hybrid builds with the new talent system?
[1:38:54] SIL3NTDE4TH: I just saw a whale eat a flying dragon and then it grew wings and started flying..
[1:38:54] DeanoTV: @Mensias WoW has to move forward, not back in time to waiting 1 minute to press a spell LUL
[1:38:55] nilachip: what class are you playing now ?
[1:38:57] Blumee9: @silodin To what?
[1:38:59] ArcaneSyntax: I did like the datamind stuff for warrior, shaman, mage and paladin tho
[1:39:00] Molvonos: @Mensias I would hope it's not like it used to be, otherwise the game would stagnate to hell and stop making money.  The fact the game is constantly evolving doesn't, however, make it equal to a 'mobile game'.
[1:39:06] pavepawns: the raid sets looking good
[1:39:17] UlsterFarl: That music is making me miss Legion again
[1:39:22] Bandit_IXII: New level cap is 70?
[1:39:27] bigbutteredbeans: How’s the TTK on this class versus other classes on alpha? @towelliee
[1:39:28] danielthegathering: loadouts? POG
[1:39:29] silodin: @Blumee9 not yet disclosed. in the next few builds we will know
[1:39:38] Caedranos: Its good wow is going back to its roots and still moving forward with new classes
[1:39:38] ProPaineTheThird: so annoying to see people still wishing the game would be like it used to be
[1:39:48] fishman_fredd: What does evoker use for weapons?
[1:39:49] Nevindaz: why is your cast bar so weird locked?
[1:39:51] danielthegathering: does dracthyr have a tank spec?
[1:39:53] Geronymo35: @Towelliee does this new race have   an only class? or u can chose severals?
[1:39:58] StarbuckTech: so glad they gave us trees back... makes the game more interesting when there is more variety
[1:39:58] rhsiuol: man feels like evokers are playing a different game compared to the rest of us
[1:39:59] Fierced: no @danielthegathering

[1:40:11] Caedranos: @ProPaineTheThird they are crazed for nostalgia that they can't get, you can not go back to your childhood
[1:40:12] jasonbriggs: @danielthegathering no it dont
[1:40:17] lalelusa: lots of mid maxing possibilities

[1:40:36] lightswinter: what is your race?
[1:40:36] lalelusa: miN maxing
[1:40:42] miguelitin98: Loadout you mean talents specs?

[1:40:55] ColdIceCreamMan: @symmij late november/early december
[1:40:59] adeekoowy: Is there sets already?
[1:40:59] akia03: is that really needed tho like in hunter you go either aoe or st
[1:41:03] darthnemoy: do they have the new tier in apperances?
[1:41:03] Orvulus: @Towelliee r there alry t-set effect in the first raid?
[1:41:03] Sollice: Year of the spear is over man. Was boring as hell
[1:41:05] ProPaineTheThird: @ProPaineTheThird Tell me about it. Things change.. it's hard to keep a game that's been going for 18 years refreshing for everyone. Things change idk how that's so hard to realize
[1:41:06] symmij: @ColdIceCreamMan thanks
[1:41:11] manmower: no reason for Blizz to waste development time on it
[1:41:14] Lukonga: what are the dracthyr race abilities?
[1:41:15] kimmo_gaming: Gratz on the charity pro-am participation, great thing to be in

[1:41:31] lightswinter: that's what they called new style of flying LUL
[1:41:33] BrothaLatinoHeat76: So is there an off fire spec build for envokers, or is it purely just fire... I'd love to run a frost spec version of envoker
[1:41:34] xnorthtv: Is weakauras going to still be a thing, or did i hear that WoW was going to make their own?
[1:41:34] Molvonos: lol @Sollice I kinda wish I'd have played Survival.  I love Dragoon-style fighting.
[1:41:40] Kisswani: I feel bad for Raidbots KEKW the amount of simming will be off the charts

[1:41:55] TraumaOwl: nvm 67
[1:42:02] Jatkins27: this class seems awesome. No way its balanced in pvp though it's going to be so OP.
[1:42:04] gymratspoti: Hows pvp??
[1:42:11] Sollice: @molvonos all it really is is throwing bombs. Dragoon so much dinner play style

[1:47:16] Xeron_159: with " zone " u mean region or the entire new ZONE?
[1:47:22] Tigerklaue: zone is big but feels so empty
[1:47:39] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Bet if you changed the soundtrack to say Elder Scrolls it would match pretty nicely
[1:47:42] Jatkins27: he means Zone
[1:47:50] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee One day i tried with flight master to go from south of Easter Kingdoms to Quel Danas, it took 28 minutes, so go figure
[1:48:00] lalelusa: hop there will be enough tools spawning upon release. the grommit quest in Korthia was terrible until they patched it
[1:48:02] Xeron_159: @Jatkins27 thank you xD
[1:48:10] Nak_FictionFriction: Asmongold Did HYJAL - Thousant Needles in like a minute ....
[1:48:13] BrothaLatinoHeat76: Ion did say that Azure is considered the largest zone map in WoW history...

[1:48:43] TraumaOwl: would be real cool if the default cast bar calculated for latency in red
[1:48:44] Voidheim: No they are new models
[1:48:45] Tooyoo: is that a UI error on the essence counter ? why do some of them empty and some dont?
[1:48:45] xnorthtv: What stats do you think this class will benefit from more??

[1:49:06] Jatkins27: maybe world boss like the one in duskwood back In the day would be cool to see some crazy dragon out in a zone
[1:49:06] the_viznar: new guardian models???
[1:49:06] Xeron_159: the face is weird tho
[1:49:08] jetributions: hey did you notice in the gear filter that theres an option for adventurer
[1:49:12] Voidheim: you'd have to go look

[1:50:32] Timothious: bet they nerf this class down some
[1:50:40] Nicoz971: Hogger looks a lil too small
[1:50:40] zovru: Hey all
[1:50:53] Voidheim: I still say the Final boss of WoW when they finally end is gonna be Murky
[1:50:56] Rabiahtaro132: Hugger more like Pogger.
[1:50:59] Nachozdood: they should have made him look more like Hogger from Hots
[1:51:14] raynestormfur: stiven last night even datamined some of the profession specific gear and they look amaziiiing
[1:51:16] mmrghost7: what item lvl are u ?
[1:51:18] nothumbgamer_ttv: i hope thrall is a raid boss, due to him being an aspect of the dragonflight when he had to step in for one in ICC
[1:51:21] M2thew: hero classes will be broken, that is how they work
[1:51:37] falldrgn: Imean I expect talents and abilities to be wildly out of balance,  in alpha

[1:52:04] Voidheim: @Nicoz971 I know I want Paladin tree so bad
[1:52:07] Qoax: Lol read the bane og the Quest giver
[1:52:10] RathianD: can you customize the nameplates ?
[1:52:11] pavepawns: paladin is kinda bad
[1:52:15] nvnto: I only saw concept art, is there more out already?
[1:52:17] ElDrakenMan: It’s gonna be chaos when a thousand people are all dragon riding around the same zone
[1:52:19] RagingPunk: i hope you can quickly switch from profesion gear to reg
[1:52:21] Cibaninja: does WoW still have the 50 char limit?

[2:04:42] DreamIV: Armour looks good but they could of made the Helm a slim crown or floating symbol or something with the glowing helm backdrop
[2:04:45] fatherfrag: @Towelliee  Do you know if the New Glad mount in the Journal on there is a Customizable mount?
[2:04:46] Alvari: @R0seblue i'm just worried because they are super late with the testing

[2:07:37] Mecabeast: updated dk class tree looks betters
[2:07:37] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee was watching lore today and he said that streamers are the worst bug reporter because they rarely use the report function and just talk with the chat that something is bugged
[2:07:42] TraumaOwl: ret paladin gonna keep up in dps this xpac?
[2:07:44] JBonezey: The ui here totally isn't finished
[2:07:47] Clodagh_Lunaria: xDDDDDD

[2:08:29] Spaydex: Shame only these proto drakes are going to have those fast travel skills. They look like oversized ducks on steroids
[2:08:36] Bahave: obviously doesn't count for every streamer :D
[2:08:37] Milanesa_De_Pollo: redditors are malding about streamers not reporting things LUL
[2:08:38] Xeron_159: @Sleepylol93 almost like ELVUI
[2:08:56] Sleepylol93: @Sleepylol93 finally thank god
[2:09:14] Sleepylol93: More addons from blizz would be awesome
[2:09:18] neomonstr: Shortly after alpha started I remember Xaryu saying "Why would I quest and explore, when I have to do that upon release? I'd rather duel"
[2:09:22] StarbuckTech: what happens when you go into an area that  warns you it is dangerous?
[2:09:24] khazroi: looks like WotlK
[2:09:25] TweektheProphet: @Sleepylol93 i believe Towelliee has a youtube video up about it
[2:09:27] mcgillacutty916: zones look sick
[2:09:34] Kisswani: I think I'm gonna use Base UI with a few WAs in DF , this looks really clean
[2:09:35] CaptainAlkohol: @Xeron_159 not sure if sarcasm but lmao
[2:09:40] Xeron_159: @Sleepylol93 it's not completly finished tho, so it's possible that's gonna be even more customizable
[2:09:46] Sarocus: @StarbuckTech ports you to Orgrimmar
[2:09:54] StarbuckTech: oh
[2:09:54] khazroi: the zone looks too familiar
[2:09:59] Silverwards: KEKW
[2:10:00] Sleepylol93: Would love to just not have to download any addons anymore
[2:10:05] Timothious: do they have a threat meter?
[2:10:07] Xeron_159: @CaptainAlkohol it's not, u can change pos. and event number of colums for each bar
[2:10:07] tebbix: yeah this is not FF KEKW
[2:10:08] superauto2016: azshara
[2:10:11] cooldito: the toxicity ship sailed 15 years ago LOL they should definitely add a basic one you can enable
[2:10:12] Dembar: `maybe they wanna aproaching it like ff14
[2:10:15] JoeeKing: thats what she said
[2:10:17] lucid_wow: this zone kinda looks like azsuna from legion imo
[2:10:22] JoeeKing: short and not much to it
[2:10:27] wakeandbacon95: aye, addons sometimes crashed my game and stuff dunno how blizz is okay with that
[2:10:27] Cibaninja: dps and gearscore/ilvl toxicity in WoW? Never.....
[2:10:33] Sleepylol93: Hope we wont need any addons in the future
[2:10:39] Xeron_159: i mean...it's more than enaugh imo
[2:10:40] XvMetalhead: XvMetalhead subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Thanks for your positivity! Appreciate your work :)
[2:10:50] temp3st98: I love now when df comes out people will make guides for how to set up their UIs LUL
[2:10:51] CaptainAlkohol: @Xeron_159 yeah you can move a few things around and make them bigger. elvui has literally thousands of options. not saying its bad, just not a good comparison
[2:10:53] Mecabeast: i mean theyre already going to retire bagnon and bartender/dominos
[2:10:57] iscripple: does all classes get a drake that fly?
[2:10:59] BabyJoker: they should
[2:11:00] Alvari: i'm starting to get the itch to play wow again..
[2:11:02] SaulMDGaming: I am an addon junkie
[2:11:03] Borsshun: so how is it gonna look like doing dps with the evoker at a raid?
[2:11:12] mrpahitice: can you show us the talents?
[2:11:15] dindu1: first impressions of the new class, whats good and whats bad atm?
[2:11:15] Borsshun: fully ranged, or hybrid?
[2:11:26] Ruthemann: Is that your normal cast bar location? seems really out of place :D
[2:11:30] TheWouze: they dont need to remove them all, would be good if they limited more on raids etc
[2:11:30] mrpahitice: long list
[2:11:33] MrFuzzynuts420: yeah good luck getting people to stop using DBM LUL
[2:11:33] Cibaninja: no addons? how else will you keep track of 40 alts
[2:11:38] fatherfrag: I cannot wait to make a Drak Healer
[2:11:40] BabyJoker: I like certain ones of course so i can't be hypocritical but anything that makes mechnanics of dungeons or raids easier just doesnt sit well with me
[2:11:40] falldrgn: @Borsshun We are so far out from that its not even funny. Things need to be tuned\tested alot m ore
[2:11:42] Xeron_159: the less addon u have the better it is, right now i think blizz is doing a good job with the ui
[2:11:46] Faebaeuwu: Gm kings, how is dragonland?
[2:11:49] moneymcduck: a dragon riding a dragon
[2:11:51] CloudPants8081: wow coming to gamepass?
[2:11:55] robert_332: ooo dragon people i wana make a healer one
[2:11:56] akromayep: 70 is the new cap ?
[2:11:59] Berkilak: I'm not inherently opposed to addons, but I hate that the game is designed with the assumption that you're using them.
[2:11:59] Kabrank: So the UI doesn't let you move castbars etc?
[2:12:00] khazroi: is it just me or the game now looks/feels depressing
[2:12:08] Sleepylol93: we re so used to addons that we cant imagine the wow game without em
[2:12:08] holiweird: I  was reluctant  at first but drakthyr looks so much fun. I found a main after 8 years lol
[2:12:16] moneymcduck: thats been the case the last 5 years at least
[2:12:17] LumberCoffee: Oh you can actually choose to never enter dragon mode?
[2:12:20] ForeverUnitedAsOne: does it not have an option to put your castbar under your frame? like you can do now
[2:12:20] Alvari: can you do the same things in human form as in dragon form?
[2:12:38] Borsshun: @Borsshun I mean generally. Fully ranged, or hybrid?
[2:12:47] Lasidor: Which spec for Dracthyr is better and why is it Preservation? @Towelliee

[2:12:53] TraumaOwl: i thought they were redoing the character ui too, looks the same as it used to be
[2:12:53] Fappy23: is there a only show if mouseover option for the action bars?
[2:12:54] Xeron_159: they should do a recount meter also
[2:12:57] Borsshun: I'm glad fwe finally got a new ranged
[2:12:58] cooldito: the new cast bar looks interesting, those nameplates look new/different too
[2:12:59] Tigerklaue: same
[2:12:59] blade_killa: same KEKW
[2:13:05] roxtempo: garbage KEKW
[2:13:15] stabzmcgeee: anything stock ui can do an addon will do 100% better
[2:13:16] superpudd: Elvui for life!
[2:13:17] Anneris1: i am droppin elvui for this
[2:13:18] Polebegood: i'm gonna try the new UI but I know i'll eventually go back to elvui
[2:13:19] cooldito: I love that the UI is finally getting some changes, it's needed it for 10 years
[2:13:20] xnorthtv: Elvui OP
[2:13:22] LumberCoffee: elvui/tukui 4 lyfe
[2:13:22] Tigerklaue: its a budget version of elvui
[2:13:25] neomonstr: I use default UI, I feel like this change could be nice
[2:13:27] CloudPants8081: murdaJForce
[2:13:27] Jack_the_Dipper: Im not gonna use bartender anymore when I can use this
[2:13:28] tebbix: Yeah I use default and I'm satisfied with this change
[2:13:29] Miklagart: there are still plenty of players even ui that still use base ui
[2:13:30] DeanoTV: ill use this defailt but with pitbull frames
[2:13:32] CritcobainTV: this is just so new players have a better ui by default i think. Nobody that uses UI addons is going to swap to this
[2:13:32] robert_332: i use spartan ui
[2:13:42] CloudPants8081: i started with tankspot ui LUL
[2:13:44] Darquesoul: I miss Mazzle
[2:13:45] holiweird: Lol its so strange to me. I prefer the default UI :D
[2:13:46] Exoduc: Yeah i mean, they did say they wanted to offer a better quality ui off the bat for new players, instead of the 18 year old before
[2:13:51] lucid_wow: i use addons for my ui but it depends on how good the base ui is bc its obviously gonna make the game run smoother than ui mods
[2:13:51] Cibaninja: @neomonstr this looks more like a discount bartender setup
[2:13:52] Alepouditsa: i like the ui
[2:13:54] Jokervenom1978: never liked UI addons myself.
[2:13:58] maldgoat: the minimap looks nice
[2:13:58] Xloun: so is gonna be 60-70
[2:14:01] stabzmcgeee: i love all the people that love this new ui that normally shit on addons,,
[2:14:03] Lorilath: add ons are one of the best things in wow
[2:14:06] anOceaninadrop: @robert_332 are you pleased with spartan ui?
[2:14:08] Darquesoul: Darquesoul subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 78 months! 
[2:14:09] khazroi: BfA vibes
[2:14:10] WayneG947: i use default, after the first time spending hours setting up everything and then it wiped I was like nope
[2:14:14] LT_Biscuit: @Ogidormu Yeah Default is fine for me also
[2:14:17] edenlock: you can easily make this look like elvui with SUF, masque and Aurora
[2:14:23] Jack_the_Dipper: Can you move the buffs and mini-map or are they gonna put that in later? @Towelliee
[2:14:28] Valzark: whats the highest level on the server?
[2:14:29] Cloudplay: does elvui has worst perfomance then standard?
[2:14:29] zenkodac: people think addons is all about dbm and bigwigs but thats not the point of them at all it's the 50 addons you use for convenience to make it look just the way you like it
[2:14:30] neomonstr: @Cibaninja I've just always had the default UI and not cared to set up an addon for it - and this change is definately an upgrade from the current default
[2:14:33] holiweird: chat can you fight in visage form? Like if you don't use flying abilities.
[2:14:42] edenlock: and it wont be much of a performance hit compared to elvui
[2:14:42] eQuinoXady: any changes to personal/enemy player frame???
[2:14:43] Bahave: It's especially good for new players imo
[2:14:48] Sleepylol93: Its nice to switch it up sometimes
[2:14:54] Milanesa_De_Pollo: glad they are partially adding bagnon into the game
[2:14:54] Xeron_159: for me...i don't want to play around an addon that require instruction book to be used...if can  customize the ui like what were seeign...for me is more than emnaugh =) i want to play the game, not a ui customizator
[2:14:56] robert_332: i am
[2:14:58] CloudPants8081: FortHype
[2:15:01] nvnto: I need way too many features that the base game will never offer for me to pass on addons.
[2:15:15] akacvrtops: this got dat northrend vibe
[2:15:18] khazroi: they copied demon hunter and built this class around it
[2:15:18] TrendyIceTee: ert? you mean mrt :^)
[2:15:23] jamsterbamster: every pvp, towelie?
[2:15:23] cooldito: default unit frames are still trash IMO though, the new bars look much nicer though
[2:15:25] anOceaninadrop: @robert_332 what do you like most about it? what features?
[2:15:26] jamsterbamster: ever*
[2:15:27] Jack_the_Dipper: Can you move the buff icons at the top right and mini-map or are they gonna put that in later? @Towelliee
[2:15:27] EpicBananners: i think I could get used to this default stuff then just add in meters and weakauras
[2:15:29] lith1995: is there any customization for the unit frames?
[2:15:38] LoGoshXCIII: KEKW
[2:15:41] Xeron_159: @khazroi so ? it's fun and still different
[2:15:44] edeasknight: elevation problemos
[2:15:46] khazroi: took existing abilities and changed their color
[2:15:49] Alvari: how far do you think they are in development with this xpack?
[2:15:49] Kisswani: @Jack_the_Dipper not in yet , should come later
[2:15:53] LoGoshXCIII: funny animation
[2:15:56] zenkodac: Xeron_159 and thats cool, if blizz ban things then no one would have the choice and would be forced to play like that, now everyone can play as they want
[2:15:57] tebbix: ???? KEKW
[2:15:57] TrendyIceTee: @lith1995 not yet, it's planned but not implemented yet
[2:16:02] Bahave: said no and left FeelsBadMan
[2:16:05] khazroi: bit underwhelming, feels depressing
[2:16:05] holiweird: lol
[2:16:10] jkitchin75: @khazroi and as long as it fun
[2:16:10] Jack_the_Dipper: @Kisswani YES!!!! Me happy :) ty for the repsonse
[2:16:24] Clodagh_Lunaria: he was called Mysterious apparition, i feel like that was meant to happen
[2:16:26] lucid_wow: bro jpc ui KEKW
[2:16:28] Korupcija_: what are you doing in stormheim
[2:16:28] MOLAR305: @Towelliee What classes talent tress arent ready, if any?
[2:16:30] khazroi: not sure whats fun about casting a spell
[2:16:31] Anneris1: I will do that!
[2:16:31] lith1995: @TrendyIceTee ty
[2:16:32] LongSnapper99: Evoker seems really confusing lol.
[2:16:33] robert_332: i love the whole thing mostly the bags and action bars and the look since you can customize the hole look
[2:16:42] Milanesa_De_Pollo: did they improve on the mouseover stuff?
[2:16:44] kimmo_gaming: Sco doesnt have an UI like that, his UI is his whole screen LOL
[2:16:44] holiweird: @Towelliee What kind of caster is Drakthyr? Dot? Builder spender?
[2:16:44] Kamedosin: less addons= less problems
[2:16:45] Valzark: i play with no bars just weak auras
[2:16:47] jamarky23: how come you 1 shot everything?
[2:16:47] Nayllen: which button feels the best to press for dracthyr so far for you @Towelliee
[2:16:52] sharpps: I use default UI with all action bars hidden and weakauras
[2:16:58] Faebaeuwu: People like me who use bartender, grid and such will probs stop using bartender and use default + WAs for our "bars"
[2:16:58] lucid_wow: i think some of the raiders in echo use default or similar too, i think deepshades used default or close to it
[2:17:05] Molvonos: They prolly run default + minimum mods to prevent potential data issues/lag that excessive mods cause, I imagine.
[2:17:08] edeasknight: it has a lot of utility buttons
[2:17:13] Orion280: can you move the castbar?
[2:17:13] TraumaOwl: i prefer to use the minimal amount of addons, ui wise they've fixed most if not all the annoyances with the classic ui
[2:17:18] zenkodac: the UI is shaping up to be cool enough where i drop elv and just use a couple of addons to try and make a lighter version of elvui
[2:17:19] TraumaOwl: only thing you need is a dps meter now really
[2:17:21] anOceaninadrop: @robert_332 alright, thanks for the info, I'll look it up
[2:17:23] nvnto: I wish they added a few more action bars to the base game.
[2:17:24] Berkilak: What would you say the rotation "goal" is?
[2:17:34] szble: the instant essence dumps are strong
[2:17:39] Notwerk80: Notwerk80 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[2:17:43] robert_332: @Spiriteaser no problem
[2:17:47] kaeildk: @Towelliee Method have asked their raiders to get a fully functional backup stock UI so they can quickly switch if their ElvUI etc breaks during WF
[2:17:54] holiweird: Living flame heals and damages?
[2:17:59] Xeron_159: @zenkodac idd blizz should not ban addons, i'm just happy that they're making their ui more customizable =)
[2:18:09] Beave_86: Can't you Teleport back after that fire spell?
[2:18:12] Timothious: can you cast that charge ability off the side of a cliff?
[2:18:13] Korupcija_: evoker feels modern af
[2:18:20] JBonezey: They need to limit their addons and bring up the floor
[2:18:26] holiweird: ooh cool
[2:18:32] shaystafford: Can you attack in human form or only dragon?
[2:18:33] xnorthtv: @Beave_86 if ther talent is specc'd
[2:18:40] roodenburgertje: is it interruptible? the flame breath thing?
[2:18:42] nothumbgamer_ttv: have you seen the grief ability "fly with me"

[2:18:58] Lasidor: Yo, why does that moose look like hes jacked on roids? @Towelliee
[2:19:02] jkitchin75: @LaughingOwlGaming both
[2:19:04] seiyamonk: what you think about the less spell range?
[2:19:06] zenkodac: and the more they give us the better
[2:19:14] Faebaeuwu: @kaeildk Their reasoning is so bad though, they said elvui causes issues, but upon looking into it, it was their 5+ years of undeleted addons and WAs that caused it
[2:19:18] JediNeo99999: Dragonriding feels better than I thought it would

[2:20:30] pavepawns: a guildie got invited
[2:20:31] Nayllen: which button feels the best to press for dracthyr so far for you @Towelliee
[2:20:33] MrCheshireCat_: i hope i will get alpha))hahah dreams)
[2:20:33] supernohva_xt: hmmmm. thats cool
[2:20:35] itjustfeelsright: it seems they do mass invites during beta
[2:20:39] Fappy23: u need CE to get in beta :)
[2:20:44] Milanesa_De_Pollo: When are Alpha key drops? Kappa
[2:20:55] zenkodac: its just one zone for 2 servers probably when they have more zones open they will roll in more waves
[2:21:03] Xeron_159: i think that pplhave to pre purchase the xpac for being invited =)
[2:21:06] LizardGodExtreme: do you like evoker?
[2:21:17] bigstanner98: 5K ANDY
[2:21:18] Kekiro: Kekiro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Dragonflight hype! towLets towGo towHype
[2:21:19] pavepawns: @Xeron_159 nope
[2:21:20] supernohva_xt: Was there a alpha invite sign up? or was it just the beta?
[2:21:22] MightyBone_Yumuros: so if towelliee doesn't play more ppl get invited ? Kappa
[2:21:25] holiweird: @Towelliee Can you cast living flame in visage form on enemies?
[2:21:27] JBonezey: Evoker is going to be super popular
[2:21:29] Beave_86: Do you think they might give beta keys again by watching twitch streams?
[2:21:33] Beave_86: like ow2
[2:21:33] zenkodac: so that the first people go to the new zones and the new people fill the first zones
[2:21:41] Jokervenom1978: Dude he HATES it when you ask him about it.
[2:21:42] Affiiance: You pretty much have to know someone to be in on this round
[2:21:44] SleepyPlant2: how far along does the expansion feel right now? Think it will be ready for end of 2022?
[2:21:46] RegalColaShakenNotStirred: RuPauls Dragonflight
[2:21:48] CritcobainTV: damn, no invite for me Sadge
[2:21:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Can't wait for redditors to claim how they have been playing the game since vanilla pre-alpha and complain about not haveing DF Alpha
[2:21:56] MrCheshireCat_: do u need to buy patch to get alpha?
[2:21:58] Stiffy84: normies like us j7st use the beta opt in
[2:22:03] jkitchin75: wait what you mean he does not have keys @Towelliee i feel robbed
[2:22:06] Xeron_159: so there's still hope :'D
[2:22:06] Berkilak: A Fury Warrior tries to stay Enraged. A Rogue builds up to big combo spenders. An Enhancement Shaman tries to capitalize and prioritize many procs. What is the "goal" of the Devastation Evoker, do you think?
[2:22:09] chrisy444: chat what will be the start lvl for evoker?
[2:22:10] silverplay1304: @Critcobain Did u pre order ?
[2:22:11] StarbuckTech: what brand and flavor of energy drink are you drinking this morning @Towelliee
[2:22:12] edenlock: I opted in the minute it was possible. no alpha sadge
[2:22:13] Diggasen: @Milanesa_De_Pollo KEKW
[2:22:13] xSimplyMike: did they add music to the alpha or is this your music?
[2:22:13] Ertra: the mobs don't have much hp it seems
[2:22:15] pavepawns: 1st raid boss is a giant poop quest
[2:22:18] CritcobainTV: @Critcobain Hell nah
[2:22:21] Madve: this class legit looks cool af
[2:22:23] Angerina: and still not bulky enough
[2:22:28] wommy: can u move camera angel down a bit so while you paly so we can see more fo the zone
[2:22:31] silverplay1304: @Critcobain thats why
[2:22:32] Sionz: It seems like Evoker Weapons will be more like stat sticks than actual useable weapons
[2:22:38] Timothious: wonder wht 2 or 3 of these evokers could do working together
[2:22:41] FewdewTwitch: 2 shotting mobs?
[2:22:42] Ertra: yeah thats a valid point
[2:22:45] Bahave: probably tbc yea LUL
[2:22:46] Sakshi117: vanilla lol
[2:22:48] Stiffy84: @xsimplymike this is his playlist
[2:22:55] Foxdoabarrelrofl: BC is the last time i remember
[2:22:56] lucid_wow: i remember struggling not to fall asleep at my keyboard doing shadowlands leveling the 2nd time around
[2:22:56] xSimplyMike: ty!
[2:22:57] syrtch: Classic
[2:23:00] JediNeo99999: @Sionz They're casters so yeah
[2:23:00] Jacinho1: wow classic/tbc
[2:23:01] denzau: even vanilla isnt hard if you know what youre doing
[2:23:04] Stiffy84: np
[2:23:05] onybear: Vanilla/bc wasthe most difficult  time
[2:23:05] Fappy23: @Sionz yes they're ranged
[2:23:09] spinoulol: you're 3shotting mobs that are same level as u, its already an issue imho
[2:23:09] tyluh_ok: @sionz That’s how it is for all casters basically
[2:23:11] iAm_Fox: Are there any dungeon up on this alpha build?
[2:23:15] Etsku: who cares about leveling
[2:23:18] Angerina: never ever has issues as a warrior tank
[2:23:18] Molvonos: Even BC was faceroll easy leveling
[2:23:18] Etsku: i sure dont
[2:23:30] zenkodac: didnt heirlooms get introduced into the game in wrath?
[2:23:30] Ma3shall: heya @towelliee nice to see ya
[2:23:31] Madve: @Towelliee does the @cursor macro work for the flying ability?
[2:23:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah but with phasing all those elite quests will be easy
[2:23:36] Sleepylol93: really like the vibe of the new Capital
[2:23:38] Ma3shall: how is going
[2:23:38] holiweird: @Molvonos Not if you are a priest lol
[2:23:42] robert_332: @Towelliee how is the Evocator healers?
[2:23:42] Etsku: literally if there was just a questline for a story and youd be max level id like that more
[2:23:43] BubblePriest: Holy pally leveling in wrath is fun
[2:23:47] pavepawns: i would also say spires of arakk in wod. the amount of bodies in that zone was worrying
[2:23:49] Valzark: i leveled as holy priest in vanilla so its always easy to level
[2:23:52] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @iAm_Fox i dont think the new ones are in but you can go to the old ones
[2:23:56] Stiffy84: Towelliee Did u ever get a group for the shark?
[2:24:03] iAm_Fox: @Foxdoabarrelrofl Cheers
[2:24:08] JBonezey: WoW might be easy, but its no where as easy as the ESOs or SWTORs of the world.
[2:24:08] JoeyIsLoud: havent seen anything on the alpha how is it so far? @Towelliee
[2:24:09] Korupcija_: nostalgia Andies
[2:24:14] MOLAR305: Scaling gives flexibility of zone order
[2:24:20] Rottencoarse: @Stiffy1984  he just said sloot and tegu helped him yday
[2:24:24] baaronthemonk: I hope they go back to letting you go back to any zone you want to
[2:24:27] Molvonos: @Ogidormu Sure it was, for any healer.  You just leveled with someone.  If you're leveling solo as a healer, you're doing something wrong, lol
[2:24:28] Sionz: Having really hard leveling content is what GW2 has and I don't think that's where the player base is
[2:24:28] Heroiske: are they a bit squishy?
[2:24:29] ShadyWizWolf: Gerd Merning Tow and Squad <3
[2:24:30] Cibaninja: scaling makes sense competing against the experience in GW2 and ESO
[2:24:31] TweektheProphet: it would also make lvling alts so bad
[2:24:35] baaronthemonk: instead of the on rails story telling of shadowlands
[2:24:36] Madve: @Korupcija_ ''ClAsSiC iS hArDeR''
[2:24:37] Stiffy84: oh i was afk
[2:24:38] theaus: would rather have no leveling and just the story campaign though
[2:24:47] lith1995: they scale to level not ilevel so youll obliterate with mythic gear anyways
[2:24:58] Madve: @Towelliee does the @cursor macro work for the flying ability?
[2:25:05] holiweird: @Molvonos levlled as shadow and it was boring af
[2:25:09] JoeyIsLoud: havent seen anything on the alpha how is it so far? @Towelliee
[2:25:23] RagingPunk: will they have that threads of fate system for df?
[2:25:24] reeosoo: 2
[2:25:26] Molvonos: @Ogidormu Boring = Hard?
[2:25:38] Kotkasilm: more bear asses
[2:25:48] mrpahitice: how long until 70 you think?
[2:25:50] tyluh_ok: It seems like the dracthyr is going to make other classes/races feel old. The dracthyr evoker model and animations are so fresh compared to everyone else
[2:25:51] Prymordias: IMO GW2 doesn't have hard leveling
[2:25:52] mrpahitice: casual gaming
[2:26:01] Sleepylol93: The new capital feels nice, nice  vibes to it
[2:26:01] Aloper60: i see even with all the ui changes, all your buffs are still a mile away from your eyeline, and debuffs....
[2:26:04] Madve: does the @cursor macro work for the flying ability?
[2:26:10] Xeron_159: @Ogidormu some thimes Useless hard = boring ...a game that's challenging  is fun
[2:26:14] Surefirexp: Does the Evoker feel like it has too many buttons or like what’s the learning curve towelliee?
[2:26:17] jamarky23: dont they also only have 4 dungeons on release?
[2:26:21] chuma_22: i hope dragon flight is delayed so people can play wrath a while
[2:26:27] Tigerklaue: dungeon would be good for talent testing
[2:26:33] holiweird: @Molvonos It is hard too. You can't pull more than 2 mobs. If you cast too much you go oom and wanding is slow af too. So i would call it hard
[2:26:34] Exoduc: You dont use the racial flight much, is it not good? towelliee
[2:26:35] captain_cold69: Zones give me a wotlk vibe
[2:26:37] Zanmato01: is the level range 60-70?
[2:26:38] KonaWolfeee: @chuma_22 what a stupid take lmao. Classic is ass
[2:26:43] itjustfeelsright: what if they realize that most testers just spam the dungeon instead of the other stuff ?
[2:26:44] Xeron_159: @Ogidormu remember visions of n'zoth...that was a "hard" that was just boring
[2:26:44] edenlock: yes, @cursor macro works
[2:26:44] 11111andrew11111: With skill trees back. Do you know if we can tank either frost dk again?
[2:26:46] Eikus11: Is this all standard UI now?
[2:26:47] ForsakenReign: It has a long cd

[2:27:02] Sleepylol93: @Eikus11 yea
[2:27:03] davidx2956: ？？
[2:27:05] Madve: is the castbar moveable?
[2:27:17] mrpahitice: how long do you thing from 60-70 casual gaming?
[2:27:26] BabyJoker: nesingway Sadge
[2:27:26] TraumaOwl: 12 hours
[2:27:34] chuma_22: @KonaWolfee if there is a huge demand for it , it isn't ass better Dragonflight is delayed so they can make the expansion better people don't want what happened to shadowlands , you dumbfuck
[2:27:43] tonyr23: Cdew was one shooting people with healer spec as evoker
[2:27:44] king_julian_96: Do they usually only use 1 week to test each zone
[2:27:52] Zuelase: I see, I feel super weak, im probably just not playing it right haha
[2:27:56] tonyr23: one shotting*
[2:27:56] Sionz: @Towelliee I really like the collapsable buff button at the top of your screen
[2:27:59] MankiGames: Yesterday I believe none of the Cooldown Reduction talents were working
[2:28:00] AkuTVgg: Max, Growl, and Dorki zoned into some M0 shadowlands dungeons last night on alpha
[2:28:02] davecorey416: max had a nice red build last night
[2:28:09] Inzidious: @Towelliee will there be profession quests like in legion??
[2:28:10] MARTZiiE: wait evokers have a tank spec??
[2:28:13] Berkilak: Any idea if Devastation's Mastery based on health remaining or health total?
[2:28:24] Dooni: @towelliee any shot you think we get a black dragonflight type tank spec maybe unlocked via campaign/story or something?
[2:28:27] zeitgeiz: No @martziie
[2:28:40] Subtlekaos: Subtlekaos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[2:28:46] Timothious: can you level in different factions starting zones in this expac?
[2:28:52] silverplay1304: @Dooni No ,they answered that 1000 times
[2:28:53] Mistery836: oh lol. they are playing heartstone at those tables LUL
[2:29:01] MARTZiiE: oh it says evoker tank in title so i thought they added something lmao
[2:29:03] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Ion mentioned they will add a tank spec to future new classes. Tinker confirmed?
[2:29:04] TraumaOwl: if only evoker did have a tank spec, mage tank that uses mitigation would be cool
[2:29:14] mrpahitice: how many bugs did you find until now?
[2:29:17] nothumbgamer_ttv: @AkuTVgg but did you see when max killed dorki with fly with me ability? xD
[2:29:34] MankiGames: @TraumaOwl They should just make Survival Hunters the next tank, they dont even have to change the name
[2:29:37] Oldduketree007: these talant trees are going too be you not meta specced
[2:29:52] holyce_gaming: Random question. How long of a cd is on the interupt skill?
[2:29:53] Xeron_159: @TraumaOwl meh...sounds like a multiclass from D&D
[2:30:04] holiweird: @Dooni I font think they would add a tank spec during an expansion. And next xpac they will focus on something else so we are out of luck
[2:30:09] Sakshi117: @Oldduketree007 its going to be multi-scenario it seems
[2:30:22] nolimitzawr: I hope they didnt change rewards from Shadowlands mission tables in Dragonflight ... this is my only income this days easly 5M a month making
[2:30:25] mrpahitice: how many bugs did you find until now?
[2:30:42] Inzidious: @Towelliee will there be profession quests like in legion??
[2:30:44] Mistery836: @TraumaOwl I mean... wow basically got their ideas from D&D including many other games LUL
[2:30:52] Zuelase: I really like the Disintegrate blue side stuff, not so much the red since I feel like it's kind of weaker
[2:30:57] Oldduketree007: @Sakshi117 will intressting to see it live :D
[2:31:09] chuma_22: Dragonflight looks very promising
[2:31:13] TraumaOwl: nothing wrong with D&D inspired specs
[2:31:15] MARTZiiE: so what are thr ups and downs with the new class so far ?
[2:31:24] Ertra: do you get worthwhile things for time trials?
[2:31:28] TraumaOwl: i've wanted mage tank since enh shaman tanks back in bc
[2:31:30] SaulMDGaming: I was about to say in my years of watching you play Alphas... this feels the most polished... considering its an Alpha
[2:31:30] Cynocles: @chuma_22 we said that about SL though xD
[2:31:33] Nayllen: are the time trials hard?
[2:31:34] Layliah79: they prob aren't in yet :(
[2:31:37] xSimplyMike: do you know with talents if you can change them for free?
[2:31:38] MOLAR305: @Towelliee if the same bug gets reported by more people do they prioritize it higher, assuming no active bugs are game breaking
[2:31:39] king_julian_96: Don’t most alpha’s go for 2 months anyway to flesh out all the content they to test and then once everything has been tested blizz start the beta and realese everything ina almost complete state
[2:31:45] nolimitzawr: @Towelliee I like the way you test Alpha  and not like Asmon using hunter eagle for 3hours lol then stopped testing
[2:31:47] Chubfishh: How is it so far? Does it feel like an Alpha or a Beta?
[2:31:47] Oldduketree007: Alpha is just not finished product Beta is more polished but server related like how many can the engine handle what quest works
[2:31:48] donhorse: does ur dragon mount grow?
[2:31:52] chuma_22: @TheCynicalKitty thats what i am afraid of , i hope they take their time with this one
[2:31:57] scumlucki: @Ertra you get a headache for trying to get gold for the time trials other than that
[2:32:04] fewyn: so you're saying there's a chance?
[2:32:06] shockingpleb: tank shaman>
[2:32:07] manmower: mages wanted tank for years
[2:32:09] BabyJoker: makes 0 sense for them not to include a massive beefy tank boi wtf
[2:32:09] Sleepylol93: I hope the armor will look amazing
[2:32:11] AnotherCheche: evoker tank where ur dragon form is a ground dragon
[2:32:13] haalxd: 3 is so big tbh
[2:32:13] Fnchentai: how can u play a ranged tank ?
[2:32:17] Nachozdood: only make since that a black dragon could tank
[2:32:18] TraumaOwl: like patch 10.2 the story adds a way to get evoker tank spec
[2:32:20] BabyJoker: it aboslutely needs a tank class it makes me mad they didnt
[2:32:21] TraumaOwl: would be dope
[2:32:25] TheBroCrow: silithus sword andys should help out
[2:32:25] szble: im guessing they have more ranged ideas
[2:32:25] ForsakenReign: a dragon tank would be pretty sick
[2:32:29] Outlawking_Gaming: We need a Mail Tank for sure
[2:32:30] Milanesa_De_Pollo: He mentioned future classes will have a tank spec tho, could hint to Tinker COPIUM
[2:32:31] quakegoogl: PopCorn draRage
[2:32:31] Qubilay: i rather had a better 500 mount av mount
[2:32:31] Aquadriel: not getting it for df tho
[2:32:33] Taaliaaaa: @Fnchentai make the abilities melee
[2:32:33] danksly: what dragon cant tank cmon bruh
[2:32:33] kranztheman: Been channeling it. I want it.
[2:32:35] Jherny: So let’s get a dh healer a dk healer
[2:32:35] holiweird: @Towelliee Their creator is literally "the tank" of Aspects. They should have it imo.
[2:32:35] scumlucki: Why do you guys want an evoker tank?
[2:32:37] Boosti661: black and bronze tank
[2:32:37] Mistery836: evoker tank would get the shamans so mad LUL
[2:32:37] spiceyholo: it just dont make sense not to make a tank spec on evoker. its a dragon!
[2:32:39] pavepawns: do you think we will see alot of glyphs added to DF too? cause professions being more prominent so giving them more off shoot stuff
[2:32:39] jamarky23: but isnt that just what you want towel?
[2:32:39] ar_melol: but tanks dont pvp. soooo no ty
[2:32:39] Caswa: last 3 new classes had tank specs, just saying :D
[2:32:40] Valzark: i dont think we need a tank we could have 100 tank classes doesnt mean people will play tank
[2:32:42] Timothious: They should put some BIS gear at the end of long quest chains
[2:32:42] Brotcore: but who gives a shit about evoker tank? MY ROGUE !
[2:32:43] jack11040: @Towelliee are there any sets for dracthyr in the appearance tab by any chance?
[2:32:45] MankiGames: Channel the Survival Hunter Tank instead :D
[2:32:47] Nightz101: channel it like u mean it
[2:32:47] haalxd: theres no shot we get evoker tank this expansion though it'd at earliest be next expac no?
[2:32:47] Aquadriel: sorry but i prefer my rogue to do well than your evoket tank
[2:32:48] zagatorr: I saw a clip of your take on LFG on  wrath, 100% agree.
[2:32:48] grizzlyhorn: ill channel that when shaman feels good
[2:32:48] scumlucki: But why?
[2:32:49] Zerqo: u can be a healer as an evoker right ?
[2:32:49] lith1995: evoker tank is a random nonsense whining tho
[2:32:53] Jherny: Everyone wants tanks and no one plays tank
[2:32:54] manmower: survival tank would be cooler
[2:32:54] qineticc: but muh rogue doesnt feel good towelliee
[2:32:54] Taaliaaaa: its crazy that we dont have a mail tank in the first place, we got fuckin leather tanks but not mail?
[2:32:55] Thoreya: i agree evoker shud have a tank spec
[2:32:56] StarbuckTech: Were they not opening all classes to all races etc. So you can be whatever race, class, spec you want. If so the it would makes since to make a tank spec
[2:32:57] Cartharon: or shaman tank maybe?
[2:33:00] Mecabeast: has anyone tried doing SL content on alpha
[2:33:02] xendros78: nah, I like my whining topics
[2:33:03] Bodhisage: Can't give every new class tank spec!
[2:33:03] xnorthtv: @Zerqo yes
[2:33:04] Naturalbeef: It wouldn't be until 11.0 anyway
[2:33:04] Grimmerino90: But i care about my shaman more than about evoker tank :-P
[2:33:05] donhorse: evoker tank does not feel right
[2:33:06] SteveMackTV: 🛡️ EVOKER TANK 🛡️
[2:33:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: i never understood the starbucks every day andys

[2:33:17] Thoriakk: Thoriakk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:33:23] manmower: take tank away from Paladins and give it to Evoker to keep balance
[2:33:25] jamarky23: Shaman tank yes please, now that we should channel
[2:33:25] Outlawking_Gaming: Dragon tank where you can harden your scales thats pretty bad ass
[2:33:29] Chubfishh: Anyone know if a 34inch Curved monitor looks great in dragonflight?
[2:33:32] Oldduketree007: Mage tank would be awesome Kappa
[2:33:41] Zerqo: @xnorthtv nice
[2:33:42] scumlucki: they wear mal i dont see why they would be a tank
[2:33:44] scumlucki: mail*
[2:33:45] executeart: would someone say it's a good time to play retail now or wait till DF launches ?
[2:33:49] dan_monk: real tanks dont want evoker tank kek
[2:33:49] neverbornlucky: towellie stuck at hospital.  possible infection on the knee cap. will you be my sugar daddy  need legendary gems in diablo immortal

[2:33:51] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:33:52] MuddyMcGir: What are our first thoughts on the new Class/Race?
[2:33:53] Madve: @Chubfishh Might look great but it aint practical lol
[2:33:53] Venasmat: We've had plenty of new classes with tank specs over the years, it's time we get a new caster DPS/healing class
[2:33:54] holiweird: @Chubfishh i use 49inch and it looks great
[2:33:54] Nibbel__: @Chubfishh looks great even now in shadowlands
[2:33:57] Korupcija_: why not a shaman tank???
[2:33:59] procyon_mfc: hitchHey
[2:34:01] MuddyMcGir: im sad i didnt make it into alpha
[2:34:01] Thoriakk: @Towelliee can you change your talents at will anywhere ?
[2:34:02] BabyJoker: you need to rally with other streamers and ask for that then @Towelliee
[2:34:03] Mistery836: that evoker mobility monkaS
[2:34:05] Shredx: @towelliee Id rather whine about not giving evoker a Visage form. dragon form looks too much like a lizardman
[2:34:06] Nachozdood: would you do that if Pally and monk tanks were ass? put the QQ aside for evoker?
[2:34:07] dan_monk: thats what ppl say
[2:34:07] xendros78: that would just be another class to bitch about LUL
[2:34:08] Bogzeh: theyre not gonna make an entirely new spec in 3-4 months for launch
[2:34:09] adeekoowy: @eXecuteFX Wait till DF release.
[2:34:09] dan_monk: gimme dragt
[2:34:09] Exusprime: Someone in here yesterday said Drakthyr are not the same as Dragonkin who carry sword in board so...
[2:34:10] Chubfishh: @Oldduketree007  nice
[2:34:12] manmower: give evoker a second healing spec
[2:34:12] oticai: all added classes so far had a tank spec, its fine for 1 new class to not have a tank spec
[2:34:14] ForsakenReign: who wouldnt like a dragon tank?
[2:34:15] DecayedmiNt: Whats a real tank?
[2:34:22] bymz: a caster tank would be pretty strong inm m+ since you can hold aggro while kiting
[2:34:22] danksly: i got a passive 'tail block' evoker tank can block dodge and parry from behind
[2:34:24] thaurman: is dragon riding faster than regular  mounts?
[2:34:27] Chubfishh: @Nibbel__ oh alright haha, then I bought one and not worry then
[2:34:28] holiweird: @Pouilla They can be both ranged healer/dps and a melee tank
[2:34:29] Inzidious: fuck em
[2:34:29] Recording_on_the_grass: thays why we wont get one lol
[2:34:31] Thoriakk: @Towelliee can you change your talents at will anywhere ?
[2:34:32] xraynibba: real player swant more shit to fuck around with always lol
[2:34:36] theoriginalzinng: i run a 34" curved ultrawide and i'll never go back to 16:9 lol
[2:34:36] stabzmcgeee: @oticai this 100% this
[2:34:37] scumlucki: @thaurman 950 percent faster
[2:34:43] Boblars: Boblars subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 84 months, currently on a 84 month streak! 
[2:34:44] ruhroraggy: not true id love it!
[2:34:44] MuddyMcGir: flight system looks neat
[2:34:45] Trifeca: I know this is so off topic but, any heirlooms change ? I would love to see
[2:34:46] Mojohusk: Evoker tank? What's next. Reanged DH
[2:34:50] shortyforthewin: how is the new expansion good or
[2:34:59] haalxd: dragon riding feels so good
[2:34:59] DecayedmiNt: World first tanks arent even tanks. They're dps players that are "forced" to tank.
[2:34:59] StarbuckTech: i remember in BC I could tank as a hunter with my pet lol
[2:35:03] Thoriakk: @Towelliee can you change your talents at will anywhere ?
[2:35:04] Zuelase: dragon riding is super fun
[2:35:04] Chubfishh: Dragonriding better in WoW or in GW2? :P
[2:35:06] executeart: @adeekoowy alrighty tnx !
[2:35:11] Cliffhoof: Do i get access to Alpha if i pre-order the game? LuvUok
[2:35:11] manmower: does it feel much better than normal flying?
[2:35:11] Zuelase: wish we had more charges though
[2:35:12] JediNeo99999: dragonriding is more fun than I thought it would be.
[2:35:13] Zuelase: of flying
[2:35:13] zagatorr: Dragon riding feels like a downgrade from flying we already have lol
[2:35:14] scumlucki: nobody in this game is a tank
[2:35:18] holiweird: @Mojohusk thats a warlock
[2:35:21] Orion280: highlight of dragonflight will probably be dragonriding i want a dragon flying sim and i found it in wow
[2:35:23] SlippieSlik: Can you dragon ride in any zone?
[2:35:23] chuma_22: Blizzard should make an option to make the ui darker
[2:35:26] scumlucki: @zagatorr theres no way you just said that
[2:35:29] Xeron_159: is it good even if it's not properly flying atm?
[2:35:31] MightyBone_Yumuros: I'm very worried it being polished till end of the year
[2:35:31] tarabibble: tarabibble subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:35:33] MuddyMcGir: LUL
[2:35:34] DeanoTV: FailFish
[2:35:35] ArctosPrime: what niche could a new tank have that the other ones dont already cover?
[2:35:35] tasadormir: seems like tiragarde sound loool sh.it map
[2:35:39] xraynibba: lmao
[2:35:41] JediNeo99999: Do you know where the race person is for dragonriding?
[2:35:42] SaulMDGaming: The Heart of the Cards!
[2:35:42] Loisteres: "i have to do stuff to fly, i dont like it" Kappa
[2:35:43] Mojohusk: @Ogidormu Exactly LUL
[2:35:45] Lasidor: These mounts can do things my regular mounts cant! Clearly downgrade lol
[2:35:46] haalxd: No shot, dragonriding is way better
[2:35:49] neverbornlucky: so if you are a dragon you dont just fly as a dragon you fly on the back of a dragon mount
[2:35:53] MuddyMcGir: needs constant speed, bad at aerodynamics
[2:35:54] Venasmat: @Ogidormu All I'm saying is that it's alright if evokers don't have a tank spec, not that big of a deal
[2:35:55] raye_gaming22: lol yugioh
[2:35:55] jamarky23: Is it nice that everything doesnt feel so claustrophobic?
[2:35:56] Rabiahtaro132: it feels like an upgrade tbh
[2:36:01] petrokdk: Do you think Drakthyr will have more classes? like hunter,mage and warrior?
[2:36:02] niekp89: the flying that class it self can do without the mount looks crazy
[2:36:03] ImperioFortisHD: Yeah dragon riding is pretty cool, also very impressed how some of the dragon forms may look like, from initial goofy version to this is pretty good upgrade
[2:36:03] lbsam4793: Spyrooo
[2:36:06] Chubfishh: @Towelliee Grounded mounts seem pointless, either make them able to wear like an parachute so they can fly or just do flying mounts, dragons and such
[2:36:07] Thoriakk: @Towelliee can you change your talents at will anywhere ?
[2:36:09] scumlucki: @neverbornlucky you can do the same thing the dragon riding mounts do as a drakthyr
[2:36:14] holiweird: RIP yugioh creator
[2:36:25] chipmunkings: Blizzard still hasn’t marketed the plot, lore, and story of dragon flight, so it’ll be like shadowlands, khadgar is going to die including other major characters for no reason at all - so on the fence about this
[2:36:27] thaurman: How big is the Dragon Isles compared to Shadowlands
[2:36:30] ur_avg_tryhard: So does the human/dracthyr form work like Worgens?
[2:36:38] neverbornlucky: I want to mount a dragon as a dragon
[2:36:41] MuddyMcGir: oh big choices
[2:36:41] soundpraenk: i hope they'll introduce more new things than dragonriding as it's not something i'm excited for, it's just that thing that is in game and is ok
[2:36:44] Timothious: advertising their other games inside wow
[2:36:51] adeekoowy: @thaurman Main map is bigger.
[2:36:59] Brendo1137: Looks nice that my belfs are getting more and more attention ^^
[2:36:59] raye_gaming22: @Ogidormu yea porb a homage on the passed sensai of yugioh
[2:37:01] MuddyMcGir: TANK
[2:37:03] ShadyWizWolf: "Mortal!" says the ghost of a mortal. >.<
[2:37:05] sardow90: i dont think they should be tanks, we have enough hero class tanks and only 1 hero class healer
[2:37:14] scumlucki: @Arnej35 Be careful you might just get Dragonghast
[2:37:16] stabzmcgeee: @Timothious hearthstone comes from wow
[2:37:19] Pallananana: gotta believe in the heart of the card my dude
[2:37:19] jamarky23: this quest is a hidden ad
[2:37:21] xXSiebzehnXx: I wonder if they put this in as a tribute to the creator of Yu Gi Oh tha died recently. Probably not, but a thought
[2:37:22] Shredx: that's how dracthyr should look
[2:37:31] ShadyWizWolf: Like good grief.

[2:40:17] Tigerklaue: kill a mob and see if you get xp
[2:40:20] baraborat: how long did it take to get to 68?
[2:40:24] Peoplewhinetoomuch: When do we get warrior talents SMOrc

[2:40:45] DeanoTV: @STK_Lucki i grew up with yugioh, been playing master duel since it came out its easy to get back into :)
[2:40:48] Sneblis: what class is that?
[2:40:50] jamarky23: @STK_Lucki Thats fair, but yugioh wouldnt exist without mtg
[2:40:58] nolimitzawr: @baraborat you start as 65 in alpha testing
[2:41:14] Ploxboxx: @jamarky23 mtg wouldn't exist without poker
[2:41:16] BabyJoker: i expect that to decrease
[2:41:33] scumlucki: @DeanoTV ive also played master duel as a new player got shafted in the campaign with the monarch deck shit is so confusing
[2:41:34] jamarky23: @Ploxboxx Poker wouldnt exist without wood
[2:41:48] BabyJoker: it took what casual players a week to level in SL?
[2:41:57] Whoz: monkaS
[2:42:04] DeanoTV: @STK_Lucki just keep at it trust me does get easier, its alot of fun
[2:42:04] Slimbo82: What class is this?
[2:42:08] silverplay1304: I dont see reccount I cant play wow
[2:42:13] scumlucki: Your prolly gonna be max level in like 2 zones for dragonflight
[2:42:17] bukka_hot: LUL
[2:42:29] adeekoowy: @Slimbo82 Drakthyr/Evoker.
[2:42:33] BabyJoker: i hope we get tank dragons man. would be so cool. it makes so much sense
[2:42:36] Inzidious: yo the crystals around you are pretty cool
[2:42:55] chulklol: @STK_Lucki  they started at 65
[2:42:57] chulklol: not 60
[2:42:59] fatherfrag: Recount?? eww
[2:43:02] scumlucki: evoker tanks dont make sense to me ngl
[2:43:06] R0yalFluffy: Are you able to customize your dragon that you ride on?
[2:43:08] scumlucki: @chulklol oh ok
[2:43:13] Osculatus: what weapon(s) do evoker use?
[2:43:16] TemperedGaming: What's your /played ?
[2:43:16] scumlucki: @R0yalFluffy yes u can
[2:43:23] scumlucki: @Osculatus mage shit

[2:43:34] R0yalFluffy: @STK_Lucki Thank you!
[2:43:39] Slimbo82: so like a mage that we know off now??
[2:44:03] chulklol: black dragon tank
[2:44:03] BabyJoker: Its a dragon how does a dragon not being tanky make sense
[2:44:05] scumlucki: how they barely wear armor
[2:44:06] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  profession upgrade maybe or u find a new recipe with those?
[2:44:08] Tigerklaue: a bulky dragon tank would make so much sense
[2:44:08] Korupcija_: nooo, we want shaman tank!!!
[2:44:09] manmower: 3rd evoker spec should be ranged or healer
[2:44:12] Timothious: Dragon knight'
[2:44:14] Inzidious: Evoker melee dps plz =)
[2:44:16] scumlucki: there practically exhibitionistrs
[2:44:19] Lasidor: You should turn into a scalebane when you tank, would be cool.
[2:44:20] Sionz: acceptance
[2:44:21] Megadisaster24: They are caster no?
[2:44:22] captain_cold69: Big armored dragons would be awesome
[2:44:22] Wrath_Twitch: rift had a mage tank... Evoker can tank if they want it to
[2:44:23] Exusprime: Are druid tanks a thing? Whats the difference
[2:44:28] MagusArlanis: Tie them into black dragon fantasy since they seem to have already went down that road
[2:44:28] captain_cold69: Look at deathwing
[2:44:29] Cibaninja: Dragons are glass canons
[2:44:30] BabyJoker: besides being strong a dragon is known for having so much health
[2:44:32] Naturalbeef: We wouldn't see a tank spec until 11.0
[2:44:38] jamarky23: they are so out of touch with what people want from the evoker class imo
[2:44:42] zeitgeiz: Making an int using ranged spec a tank isn’t easy.
[2:44:42] goofywizard: Bro we need a tank spec. I know it’s coming though
[2:44:43] Rabiahtaro132: They have enough instant cast spells to be able to justify them tanking.
[2:44:52] Armdel: isn't dragon scales usually super durable in fantasy settings
[2:44:56] PhatManPyro: What Weapons do the Evoker use?
[2:44:59] paravak: They are made by Neltharion/Deathwing, leader of black dragons who PROTECT azeroth. Why tf would they not make sense as tanks lmao
[2:45:00] NecroTarkan: come on have you ever seen a dragon raid boss? hmm?
[2:45:01] manmower: cast time channels as tank
[2:45:04] WookieeWithPuffyNuts: do you think they work on WOW 2 ?
[2:45:05] Qoax: They could make a  black dragon tanking talent
[2:45:07] BabyJoker: you gotta rally the streamers for this towliee so many want a tank spec with it
[2:45:12] havenbirch: Ranged Tank
[2:45:17] scumlucki: The healing spec for evoker is gonna need some 5head level plays theres so much shit you can do with it
[2:45:20] jamarky23: Evoker is just a reskinned Demon hunter... change my mind
[2:45:21] zeitgeiz: What do you mean we need a tank spec? Last three new classes have all had a tank spec
[2:45:21] udderlyepicgaming: so the new class is able to do all 3 roles? DPS, Tank and Heal
[2:45:21] paprickan: only thing we NEED is a Tinkerer class
[2:45:22] manmower: make a new tank spec that isn't evoker
[2:45:29] scumlucki: how does a ranged tank even work?
[2:45:31] Stiffy84: no need for bagnon anymore
[2:45:34] nolimitzawr: @WookieeWithPuffyNuts WoW 2 will never come there just no logic why would they do it
[2:45:35] Wildspirits2: bc every class they added since classic are melees and tanks. now is time to casters/healers
[2:45:36] Armdel: id guess they'd kinda be a reskin of bear druids though
[2:45:39] Sakshi117: druids wear leather 🤷
[2:45:39] Sneblis: @Slimbo82 Dragon class
[2:45:39] scumlucki: What we need is a freaking bard
[2:45:39] JxJay: they should make deathwing a tank spec for evoker LUL
[2:45:40] Shrapnel_Sponge: @Armdel theres a reason in dnd dragons have high armour class
[2:45:46] Taaliaaaa: @udderlyepicgaming no only dps and heal
[2:45:46] scumlucki: full on support class
[2:45:47] Tordrek_: evoker is magical. unless you take it in the route of spell breaker
[2:45:47] Naturalbeef: Tinker tank!
[2:45:49] CurlyFriass: there might an achievement that shows that no?
[2:45:56] cooldito: @Wildspirits2 this
[2:45:57] Nightz101: like bears can tank but dragons cant huh
[2:46:06] WookieeWithPuffyNuts: @nolimitzawr for Xbox
[2:46:07] goofywizard: It would be nice to see an infusion of dragon and human form for tanks
[2:46:13] Timothious: surprisiong they didnt just get rid of the bags and make one big bag
[2:46:15] scumlucki: @Nightz101 i mean bears are tough asl

[2:47:05] Zynarch: Dragon riding looks good
[2:47:05] Timothious: ahh copied eso

[2:47:19] Mensias: fully copyed
[2:47:19] manmower: i think the dragonflying is a pretty smart way to do flying, force people to fly low to see the landscapes you created
[2:47:19] Timothious: on the crafting stuff
[2:47:24] scumlucki: I dont think wow would ever end up on consoe
[2:47:33] Molvonos: Yea, it scales you down though
[2:47:39] Orion280: proving grounds should scale
[2:47:46] raynestormfur: @STK_Lucki you can play it on the valve steam deck :P

[2:48:27] raynestormfur: @STK_Lucki still goes under the umbrella of "handheld console"
[2:48:29] Slimbo82: can dragon class be every think, like tank healer and dps? Or only dps
[2:48:29] Callistio: @1304SilverPlay save 10 a month, buy before it drops :)
[2:48:44] Zynarch: @manmower I think it's perfect compromise to people who complain that flying took away the traveling through beautiful zones and people who still want flying
[2:48:48] Pallananana: link PHD or no inv

[2:52:48] brabblesauce: new zones are wide open which is a major plus
[2:52:48] xraynibba: uninspired??? they are literally inspired by wrath

[2:52:57] Arwgi: does evoker need macros to play better?
[2:52:58] paprickan: The thing i love with the new zones is the open spaces

[2:57:07] adeekoowy: @rygothx Yep.
[2:57:08] generaljosh721: @jootti im not disagreeing with you. It's just unlikely that they will do any texture updates at this point
[2:57:14] haneything: lmao did you get a covenant?!
[2:57:15] Aft3rGl0w_89: i thought they would remove the covenants?

[2:57:53] goofywizard: Im liking how advanced evoker looks like. Should i preorder the 90 dollar pack?
[2:57:56] jack11040: @Papfar 58 and prepatch they will most likely be creatable
[2:57:56] Beawolf1517: I heard 58

[2:59:57] gfield2k: Why can’t you fly @towelliee ?
[2:59:58] goofywizard: I think it’s cool starting off a as a evoker. Learning and experimentation of the class as u level is great
[2:59:58] Armdel: i imagine they still slowly roll out the points while you go through the starting zone, instead of giving you all 58 points immediately
[3:00:07] mysteriousm4n: back to Korthia
[3:00:08] bendsber: snorthia

[3:02:14] Banjo586: no :)
[3:02:15] Armdel: i
[3:02:19] generaljosh721: @armdel I see what you mean. Although you can't even make one without a max level character so to me there's no point in protecting a new player because they are already experienced enough to have a lvl 60 unless they boosted haha
[3:02:23] CajunCrusader: @Towelliee, if all the zones are this smooth, you think that makes the 2022 release realistic?
[3:02:26] Pallananana: Yeah how would thorgast work? there wouldn't be any spell specific upgrades?
[3:02:28] cruzeal: i wish i had sadge
[3:02:29] Dafrekknpope: 5 ads oof

[3:09:16] mrpahitice: do you have damage meteR?
[3:09:16] PhillyDilly18: @Snlp_ Sure! Season of Mastery is just the original world of warcraft. The devs upped the difficulty of all the raids. There is also an exp buff and some other quality of life stuff. However, it ends in a few months. It was only meant to run 1 year.
[3:09:21] D347Hzor: wonder what skips gonna people find with the new grip in new dungeons

[3:11:48] Adarahhl: Hey Towelliee, great interview with Ion. Quick tank question, do you look at your character or mobs when tanking mainly?
[3:12:02] Clicklesly: Evoker tanking finally happening i see Kappa
[3:12:12] TommySeeker: this is troll lmao
[3:12:14] manmower: blizzard removing damage numbers to make a friendlier playerbase

[3:12:19] miypvp: @Towelliee do this:    /run for _, v in pairs({"CombatHealing", 'CombatDamage', "CombatState", "LowManaHealth", "ComboPoints", "EnergyGains", "PeriodicEnergyGains", "Auras", "DodgeParryMiss", "FriendlyHealers"}) do SetCVar("floatingCombatText"..v, 1) end ReloadUI()

[3:16:25] onous_: Are there any new dungeons open for you to test?
[3:16:28] meroxzx: kiljaden mythic still pain in the ass ?
[3:16:32] Kize_Gaming: @iAkashaHeHe Alpha
[3:16:32] zgag: Toweliee.  Do an all Evoker pvp battel
[3:16:42] Banjo586: @iAkashaHeHe Blizzard damage from the game because it causes toxicity
[3:16:43] Bubisaur: yo @Towelliee do you have any idea if Dragonlands has improved Multi-core support? Or is it the same as Shadowlands?
[3:16:48] Xtops: whats the gcd of the flight breath attack ?
[3:16:56] uwandre: Is this a new UI or just a add on you are using?
[3:17:17] asmodai4823: its still shit
[3:17:19] rohdey: i think the multi core stuff came in bfa no?
[3:17:21] manmower: WoW isn't a very demanding cpu game
[3:17:23] j_bar111: added with dx 12 i think
[3:17:23] Mickker: can you use soar in pvp ?
[3:17:31] Nibbel__: @uwandre no addons, completely new ui
[3:17:32] belaham: Up to 6 cores based on the requirments
[3:17:35] one_rs: @uwandre new ui
[3:17:36] blazeofhell: dx11 is multicore, dx12 is better multicore
[3:17:37] Jollywhompus: Every day I learn of a new complaint from the WoW community
[3:17:41] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee are there gonna be new allied races?
[3:17:41] JediNeo99999: It's more CPU dermaing than GPU...
[3:17:43] Velashen: Been a thing.
[3:17:45] zenohold: You should try thorgast definetly
[3:17:47] Bubisaur: I think the current problem with multi core is limited to like 3 cores - was just wondering based on the new requirement if it acutally means betetr mutli core support
[3:17:48] JediNeo99999: demanding*
[3:17:50] coloursttv: does the evoker class have covenant ability?
[3:17:51] JBonezey: Max and friends said the Alpha ran smoother than live
[3:17:56] sic_xx: evoker has tank spec??
[3:18:00] TheKingOfWit: is wow not performant on a good pc? never really heard about wow not running well
[3:18:05] Evo_Me: lacLaugh lacLaugh
[3:18:15] ggilgamech: since when WoW needs multicore to work smoothly
[3:18:15] brylba: what is the difficulty?
[3:18:18] TheGiant99: no matter what they do people will always complain. it's how things are now....
[3:18:21] grumpnamedjosh: Does your nameplate still have an option to move your castbar underneath it still?
[3:18:22] Lasidor: What would multicore support do for WoW? The game is still a borderline potato in comparison to  other major games.
[3:18:23] ShauzyFX: If you cant run wow then get a new pc
[3:18:26] alextheory_: no idea what that stuff is anyway
[3:18:28] lordJimmbob: to get combat text i think you need to use a command
[3:18:29] xraynibba: who cares about how many cores it uses what does that even effect?
[3:18:44] zgag: Good job bro..  Oh shit
[3:18:44] laurent94: where are the advertised player plates ?
[3:18:49] rantre208: rantre208 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Thanks for streaming the alpha
[3:18:51] blazeofhell: it affects fps and not making you bottleneck GPU
[3:18:57] JediNeo99999: I couldn't find you in LFG
[3:18:57] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:18:58] Dyasis: @laurent94 not in yet
[3:19:07] SsenkradDesruc: @xraynibba It can make a night and day difference
[3:19:15] Lasidor: If your bottlenecking your GPU on WoW, its time to upgrade...
[3:19:21] mrpresbaby: I have a feeling that we'll have a tank shortage at the start of DF
[3:19:29] Naturalbeef: I had multi cores on my WoW Complaint bingo card
[3:19:43] Gingerprimer: @Lasidor there is always a shortage of tanks
[3:19:43] jerryz2810: mist didnt have damage numbers on maxs stream
[3:19:43] andreaued: how you are playing Dragonflight now?You just bought the expansion?
[3:19:46] loddlaen87: @towelliee havent seen any alpha gameplay yet, hows evoker feeling so far?
[3:19:53] Gingerprimer: @andreaued alpha
[3:20:22] 3dRes: @xraynibba the more cores, the smoother the game runs. Old PC's can't handle such things, and many people still play WoW on such machines
[3:20:27] Lasidor: @Gingerprimer Agreed, but in an Alpha like this one where only BDK is "active" is going to be even worse.
[3:20:33] andreaued: @gingerprimer  but i need to buy the expansion to play the Alpha
[3:20:41] thevelblade: I hate this class colour anyone else?
[3:20:48] thevelblade: seems really unrepresentative
[3:20:57] JediNeo99999: @Gingerprimer You can play other tank classes they just don't have new talent trees
[3:21:03] cruzeal: Kreygasm bear time
[3:21:03] Dyasis: @andreaued no, only friends/family and content cretors play alpha
[3:21:06] Volatilestyle: why are damage numbers off
[3:21:12] belaham: i can see alot of evokes dying trying to get that charge up to 3 because of there parse LOL
[3:21:21] the_kisner: @Volatilestyle its alpha, no addons
[3:21:22] Kriven: @thevelblade i mean its a color i dont really care lol
[3:21:23] TSquadSully: TSquadSully subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[3:21:29] the_kisner: @Volatilestyle Oh nvm read it wrong
[3:21:35] Lasidor: @Gingerprimer Sure, so since theres nothing new to see, people arent going to play it in an Alpha.
[3:21:42] Volatilestyle: damage numbers are part of the game lol...
[3:21:45] MightyBone_Yumuros: @Lasidor alot since f.e. the ryzen architecture uses multicore - so you bottleneck way harder in wow then you should f.e. you use 1 core instead of 8 - I can run the most recent games on ultra just wow gives trouble due to no multicore support
[3:21:54] ashnmsr: @thevelblade yeap mee too
[3:22:02] thevelblade: WoW has multicore support now
[3:22:03] JediNeo99999: @Gingerprimer guardian tree looks really good and lots to test not just BDK
[3:22:06] andreaued: @dyasis so i dont need to buy the expansion to play Dragonflight alpha?
[3:22:10] thevelblade: And I know it's just a colour but it's an ugly colour
[3:22:17] bukka_hot: get more dps as well
[3:22:18] Dyasis: @andreaued you can't get into alpha...
[3:22:18] Ramoneko: good morning towe, chat!! hows everyone going?
[3:22:33] zenohold: Try torghast for sure!
[3:22:34] Bubisaur: @Lasidor yeah, that's why i was wondering if the there was any news about this, seeing as the reuiqrements says 'recommend to use 6 cores' but if the game can't even use it, what's the point =p
[3:22:39] Megadisaster24: NGL, no damage numbers would be a great feature to this game
[3:22:42] RiskyChristian: Do they have any of the engineering stuff up ?
[3:22:44] brawlcuttt: Have you tried other classes yet or waiting a bit :D ?
[3:22:47] Lasidor: @Gingerprimer Apologies, forgot about bear.  So 2 tanks are "active".
[3:22:47] Macrodotz: @thevelblade we already have enuf greens aswell I agree with u
[3:22:54] andreaued: @dyasis why?
[3:22:54] xnorthtv: @zenohold I dont think torghast works

[3:23:22] TheWouze: Love how shit players want features taken out of game so people can carry them

[3:23:28] Jollywhompus: Tell me you are an FF14 player without telling me you are an FF14 player
[3:23:30] Dyasis: @andreaued I already told you, only blizzard friends and family and content creators get it, you will have to wait for beta
[3:23:32] Cloudemon: people with bad damage say that
[3:23:32] bendsber: zone looks great
[3:23:32] Fnchentai: yeah  u will never know who to blame
[3:23:32] DarkenedHour97: no if you are a shitter it needs to be broadcasted to the group
[3:23:34] JBonezey: Not having DPS meters removes elitism
[3:23:37] Spaede: Spoken like someone who’s a power bottom on the meters lol
[3:23:46] xraynibba: not it would not remove elitism

[4:04:37] shark_bizzle: I haven't watched much on this expansion, do we think this will help bring wow back to life?
[4:05:21] AlphasaurusRexx: no wow is dead. best to wait until 11.0 and see
[4:05:30] Nachozdood: @SharkBait232 Its going to take more then 1 expansion to bring the game back to life but it will never be the same way it was before
[4:05:37] Daemoos6: @Stiffy1984 We will. Prepatch is the expansion without content

[4:16:52] procyon_mfc: Does changing spec change your class talent selection choices on the left side? @towelliee
[4:17:11] AlphasaurusRexx: @Luxicake yeah. main difference is you can save loadouts for these talents to make switching really easy. but you still need to be in a rested area
[4:17:18] KonaWolfeee: Chat from what we have seen. Is evoker heals even worth speccing into?

[4:31:24] hickey7979: im sitting here watching it so the content isnt overrated, i may have used the wrong word i just dont think its worth buying access for average person
[4:31:25] AlphasaurusRexx: @hickey7979 he does that literally every alpha and beta. are you new to his stream?
[4:31:27] shark_bizzle: So do you get points for both trees no matter the spec?

[4:40:45] Jey1h: LB doesnt have a cd :P
[4:40:49] crawds: do they double jump and glide like DH

[4:40:59] bvbdragon: heal evoker mastery is so boring
[4:41:06] vanz38: after having talents sorted, if we remove 1st talents for not having others unlocked, will they just lock until spending enough talents, or delete and need to take them again?
[4:41:25] heypnuts: @crawds It looked like it in the wowhead videos
[4:41:56] bvbdragon: tranq copy
[4:42:00] Jey1h: its so good
[4:42:00] vengeanceee7: Alter time
[4:42:01] derry10: its a big healing cd
[4:42:01] b00mkind: i wish it had some kind of melee spec or tank
[4:42:01] asmodai4823: death strike
[4:42:03] temp3st98: It's rewind time
[4:42:04] LuiBMHunter: hmm would it bring someone back to life?
[4:42:06] ForsakenReign: it works on fall damage you can test it
[4:42:11] ZarxIV: That is going to be nerfed
[4:42:12] vengeanceee7: It's mass alter time
[4:42:14] gritbarontv: well it has a 4 min CD
[4:42:15] holeindoorstudios: 50% of dmg, so 25%
[4:42:17] ChechiTV: revival basically
[4:42:17] whyabadi: It's 50% of the damage
[4:42:19] holeindoorstudios: 75% hp
[4:42:20] Jey1h: @bvbdragon its nothing like tranq lol
[4:42:24] ijuki: You need to pop it before it happens
[4:42:25] ghost186_: Op
[4:42:32] TyndiVelspaz: if raid loses 30% health. that ability restores 15%
[4:42:32] Vaxhim: No that would bring them back to 75% HP.
[4:42:33] wisplingz: op
[4:42:38] Vaxhim: Heals for 50% of the damage taken unless in party.
[4:42:38] Jey1h: @ijuki No after
[4:42:42] ghost186_: This class is going to get nerfed as fuck
[4:42:44] br3z: put some outlaw rogues in the evoker group
[4:42:45] DaBestGAround: @gritbarontv it can be dropped to 3 minutes or two charges later in the tree
[4:42:53] ijuki: @Jey1h monkaS Really?
[4:42:53] br3z: get that cd down
[4:43:03] N0RCAL1: damn lol
[4:43:10] ijuki: Well, that is busted
[4:43:21] barnanimal: oh thats so broken
[4:43:27] ninetysix: @Towelliee may u please explain to me a pvp talent i forgot the name its the interruption talent and it confused me
[4:43:29] asmodai4823: think of it as a raid wide death strike @Towelliee
[4:43:34] SketchyGlenn: yea it says within 40yards
[4:43:35] elflandeman: mistweaver on steroids
[4:43:35] lalelusa: all allies within 40 yards
[4:43:36] Jey1h: @ijuki Yes, the spell is called rewind, its not rocket science LUL
[4:43:36] barnanimal: 40yd range it seems
[4:43:36] Snabido: Death Strike, but everyone Kappa
[4:43:38] Luwny: hard maths
[4:43:40] Mecabeast: also passive hp5 aura in human form is good too
[4:43:41] endsage21: looks like Evoker wants to stack crit
[4:43:41] infinityarty: at least, if they took more dmg then 7,2k youll heal more
[4:43:44] Daarksyde: like a big Revival but CD dependent on AOE dmg from boss
[4:43:49] K3ks112: everyone atleast 7,2k and in a m+ group it would be atleast 14k i guess
[4:43:50] Jatkins27: it's like divine hymn but instant
[4:44:02] whyabadi: It's just a Revival with some flavor
[4:44:06] shark_bizzle: talk about an oh shit button
[4:44:08] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  crit for dps as well or just preservartion?
[4:44:20] ijuki: @Jey1h Well, rewind is moving back to something that was before... so techinally both of us are correct but the skills works as you wrote :)
[4:44:27] KrimsonElite: it probably splits the healing
[4:44:31] avatar_kevin: it is 4 ppl
[4:44:32] NorthCrusade: Is the echo the only empower ability?
[4:44:37] tedol: 26k looks like full pool, not for every one
[4:44:56] duffluv22: This is like learning the game all over again...I like it
[4:45:05] Sgt_Frosti: Are they like worgens and jump out of humanform when they enter battles? @towelliee
[4:45:18] Jatkins27: no u can be humanform and cast
[4:45:20] heypnuts: stagger
[4:45:21] Zayvion: they give out stagger
[4:45:22] SketchyGlenn: Sheesh evoker heal seems pretty solid.
[4:45:22] ijuki: Mini stagger?
[4:45:23] Snabido: Stagger KEKW
[4:45:26] barnanimal: yeah you turn someone into a monk
[4:45:26] Ralvay: I'm watchin this genshin impact AD 4th times today. I won'T play it god dam please enough Twitch

[4:45:52] KrimsonElite: this class is gonna be fun
[4:45:52] oSirKnight: oSirKnight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[4:45:56] lalelusa: does that work with echo?
[4:45:59] evelcandy: Cheer100
[4:46:01] tedol: yea, for pvp can be very strong
[4:46:04] ChechiTV: that on a dk
[4:46:05] Chrizzor13: he cant purify it
[4:46:07] Rabiahtaro132: Monk double stagger.
[4:46:09] Kickingsite: stagger the stagger
[4:46:18] elflandeman: toweliee is turning my amazon alexa on all morning by saying "echo" lol
[4:46:49] SetaCA: says damage they "would" take. is it staggering any damage?
[4:46:55] Daarksyde: i wouldn't consider that bronze spell a "healing" spell
[4:46:55] NorthCrusade: lmaoo
[4:46:56] Luxicake: LUL
[4:46:58] DeanoTV: KEKW
[4:46:58] MrGattz: you bitch

[4:47:03] alex12645: LUL
[4:47:03] SaulMDGaming: LUL takes sip
[4:47:07] heypnuts: Doubt it echo on this one.
[4:47:07] fewyn: Now Playing....
[4:47:09] tedol: LUL
[4:47:14] Daarksyde: reduces dmg, does not heal or add shields
[4:47:16] Masheck: I'm glad the talent tress are back
[4:47:28] Secondtrigger: You would make blood DKs less spikey for a short time
[4:47:30] hyboric: funny funny
[4:47:35] Zayvion: im looking forward to heal with this class
[4:47:39] shark_bizzle: This is another shaman level of buttons
[4:47:46] oSirKnight: bronze seems good for m+
[4:47:47] grimmy17: @Secondtrigger Not good for blood DK
[4:47:52] tedol: need 3 more
[4:47:56] heypnuts: Need them toe keyboards
[4:47:56] im_n0t_jezus: YESS buttons are back
[4:48:14] itscityboy: how's evoker heals? just tuned in
[4:48:21] grimmy17: I doubt it
[4:48:24] K3ks112: also as a singel target dmg
[4:48:27] Sgt_Frosti: Omfg i want dragonflight NOW!!!
[4:48:36] grimmy17: Probably fish for procs with azure for the essence burst
[4:48:46] lalelusa: echo+living flame
[4:48:55] lalelusa: echo+everything XD
[4:48:57] Secondtrigger: A blood DK with no runic power then gets smacked is dangerous. Giving them stagger long enough to get runic power can be helpful
[4:49:09] TWB1990: it looks like blizzard made something with great potential. I hope they don't squander it
[4:49:16] ForsakenReign: they have really short range on all their heals too

[4:49:55] Jey1h: imagine your main hot on tank, then echo on 2 other people
[4:50:04] grimmy17: It's kind of like beacon from paladin
[4:50:06] Rabiahtaro132: Echo is really good for the HOT
[4:50:09] grimmy17: Plop on tanks and forget
[4:50:10] Zettabyte: But Echo doesn't have its Limit? Kappa
[4:50:13] Zellya: ima absolutely playing evoker-DH combo in DF holy crap blizzard makes new stuff OPPPPP
[4:50:17] nheonkitty: does the dps spec have decent self healing?
[4:50:19] Jey1h: its like a single heal beacon

[4:51:16] ijuki: A wall maybe?
[4:51:22] duffluv22: pvp talent?
[4:51:22] sir_skaeg: try to echo it

[4:54:13] Rabiahtaro132: Does the stagger and time dilation keep passing damage between eachother though?
[4:54:21] Katosama: try with sloot ?

[5:04:55] Balkep: seems like a fairly rare proc though
[5:05:01] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  i think its based on how many essences you have
[5:05:01] cellarrr: Looks kind of slow and unreliable
[5:05:03] nothumbgamer_ttv: @EoTrick that tasty twitch prime badg you have can stop that happening ;) <3
[5:05:08] Luxicake: im kinda over legos so thats sorta nice to hear
[5:05:12] nevillethewizard: @towelliee Do you think a gtx 1070 will be good enough for DragonFlight on 1080p based on your testing?
[5:05:13] emilools: do some flying Pog
[5:05:15] Aenvys: i love it
[5:05:24] net_mi: I hope there is no legendaries
[5:05:26] d1stract10n: get more targets
[5:05:32] EoTrick: @ogthumbless I don't pay for prime. lots of other subscriptions I have to pay for, can't do Amazon prime.
[5:05:33] Luxicake: exactly
[5:05:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: im fine with a questline style of legendary not the each class has 10 to choose from shit
[5:05:34] soapypony: soapypony subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[5:05:35] belaham: thats a short CD for something that has the ability to be pretty powerful
[5:05:40] Balkep: "legendary" Kapp
[5:05:43] Zellya: how many healing buttons do you have towelliee
[5:05:43] Dagomarus: i think when i eventually get a Drakthyr il go healer, it feels like a more intersting healer than a ranged dps
[5:05:43] Jokervenom1978: Towelliee's slot machine mentality taking over. towHAMUP
[5:05:52] barnanimal: I wish they would so something like classic, where there class-specific meta items like Benediction but you'd have to go through a quest
[5:05:55] Wcvechten: make them do pvp again, to filter out people too, like mop
[5:05:56] temp3st98: like mop
[5:05:57] Aruce: like wod ring
[5:05:59] Luxicake: agreed, the cape back in mop
[5:06:00] zakare232: i liked the dreanor quest
[5:06:01] marshmallow110: like the MoP legendary Cloak?
[5:06:03] net_mi: TBH legendaries are no fun to play around
[5:06:05] derry10: MoP with the cloak, and the Ring in WoD
[5:06:05] Rinizon: like the rogue daggers
[5:06:08] Ralykx: like the wrathion ring?
[5:06:08] Frank4LuLz: the o g ring\
[5:06:11] jerseyfive: buying legendary in auction house DansGame
[5:06:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: make a lego trinket
[5:06:19] BlewGamingGroup: the fun in legendaries is the questline stories that go with em
[5:06:22] Luxicake: they just felt more important when you had to do more to earn the lego back then
[5:06:26] xendros78: they were cool questlines that got nuked instead of having their rewards changed after the xpac ended
[5:06:28] Lataran: yeah that was fun
[5:06:29] Frank4LuLz: mop back for the prince
[5:06:37] Nachozdood: id rather have a thunderfury type of leggo
[5:06:39] d1stract10n: @Wcvechten that would exclude people and blizz wont. but also i hate pug pvp
[5:06:50] Zellya: how many buttons in the healing rotation thus far?
[5:06:52] K3ks112: but this doesnt seem 30% ish
[5:06:58] Dagomarus: i dont mind legendaries but i do not want to spend millions of gold over the course of a expansion on white base pieces
[5:06:59] duffluv22: More crit....somehow
[5:07:02] temp3st98: classic to wod had something to do with raids to get legendaries and then came legion
[5:07:06] MorningNickness: Possible the proc is more likely if the player actually needs the heal and isn't full?
[5:07:15] Tooyoo: Sylvanas bow/
[5:07:17] savamalac1: maybe the proc chance is capped?
[5:07:18] d1stract10n: how about shadowmourn style lego
[5:07:22] clubnp: but why? seems like a dev choice
[5:07:31] K3ks112: mayb still hit report
[5:07:37] grumpnamedjosh: What does your mastery stat increase? @towelliee
[5:07:39] d1stract10n: the broc % may be wrong
[5:07:48] TheKingOfWit: legendaries are borrowed power and they're trying to move away from them. adding them as talent choices is way better at this time
[5:07:48] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:07:48] Balkep: 2 max still
[5:08:29] arturiuss44: they should put a long questline in the game where once completed you can choose any legendary from vanilla to now that you can upgrade to highest current ilvl make old leggos relevant.
[5:08:51] temp3st98: I liked fangs of the father legendary for rogues in cata
[5:09:17] Northrad: They should do MOP style legendaries again
[5:09:28] BlewGamingGroup: @arturiuss44 then they would have to go through and rebalance every lego in game
[5:09:46] K3ks112: the orb sstays same, but hp/s goes up
[5:09:46] love_eggplant: i want to breathe healing on peope :3

[5:14:49] LethalHaircut: the "continues healing" didin't really work
[5:14:52] Zellya: well, easy choice for a main i guess
[5:14:53] volkreig: No healing afterwards so bugged?
[5:14:59] sir_skaeg: i wonder if its gonna replicate your spells or what it means
[5:15:08] Balkep: maybe you need to be in combat or something
[5:15:12] noobkouhai: pog
[5:15:14] BloodxxMerchant: looked like it was healingjust no animation?

[5:16:08] belaham: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:16:10] Eejvert: then whats the point of talents
[5:16:11] Exoduc: Means its a nice design no?
[5:16:15] deliriumvoid: don't worry when it the talents get flushed out everyone will have the same build
[5:16:22] net_mi: That's the point with the new talent tree
[5:16:24] versed24: what type of armor do evokers wear???
[5:16:26] lalelusa: can you save different talent trees like armor sets? for easy swapping?
[5:16:26] barnanimal: yeah true, of the healer trees released so far, each of the nodes seems really fun to take
[5:16:31] Siven80: meaningful choice!
[5:16:32] net_mi: no more min-maxing
[5:16:35] Siddie: As long as we have the option to go back and forth depending on what we are doing in game, I think it will be nice
[5:16:47] Daarksyde: it will be everyone's own niche. Healing will be a big difference from player to player
[5:17:07] Ellysia_Banearrow: Toweliee and friends, what's up guys?!
[5:17:34] itscityboy: jesus

[5:20:02] Balkep: yeah, 1m sounds generous
[5:20:12] derry10: that sounds like the old chi torpedo in mom

[5:20:41] stallowned: dayum
[5:20:41] itscityboy: GYAT
[5:20:42] goofywizard: Idk about the talent tree tbh. That pro is that you can make a crazy mixture of gameplay with those talents but a con is that most of these talents can just be baked into the class
[5:20:43] d1stract10n: fly to org
[5:20:56] Deadelus0: WOW :O
[5:20:56] heypnuts: It's cool, but honestly, how useful is it?

[5:21:11] Y2GaMbiNo: That's legit.. I like that
[5:21:12] Murlock07: nice
[5:21:16] BlewGamingGroup: raid stack
[5:21:19] heypnuts: Maybe a mechanic stacks the raid on a long wall
[5:21:24] raldrik: evoker positioning is going to be key for dps or heals
[5:21:25] HAMMERRAZOR: hey towelliee hey chat how are we all?
[5:21:30] Daarksyde: movement with heals, always a HUGE benefit
[5:21:36] diaperman42069: that would have been nice on halondrous intermissions
[5:21:38] Balkep: yeah, just a big spot aoe heal if you play it right
[5:21:39] crawds: what if ppl follow you while breathing
[5:21:41] stallowned: aoe heal + quick movement would be great during a fight
[5:21:44] d1stract10n: 1min CD will make it huge
[5:21:47] Clicklesly: Or fly over the whole raid while everyone's moving
[5:21:51] Zylvax: Can you try using echo with that ability?
[5:22:14] diaperman42069: whats the CD @Towelliee
[5:22:22] lalelusa: dream breath sound like a mouth wash thing
[5:22:29] Murlock07: LUL
[5:22:30] Lasidor: The distance on that is intense
[5:22:31] Daarksyde: the range on this heals is crazy

[5:23:02] volkreig: Cloudburst?
[5:23:02] diaperman42069: wait
[5:23:03] chunk_the_brit: that heal seems broken bit far.. should report
[5:23:05] diaperman42069: so convoke?
[5:23:07] Noxyll: sounds like another cloudburst
[5:23:12] stallowned: crazy burst dmg?

[5:23:44] d1stract10n: use it and cast the bouncing spell 3 times the re cast it
[5:23:46] sir_skaeg: basically build a convoke
[5:23:47] Noxyll: Cloudburst Totem
[5:23:48] grimmy17: yeah
[5:23:48] vargath_: yep
[5:23:48] Lasidor: I would think so
[5:23:54] vargath_: and re use
[5:23:55] Daarksyde: seems legit like cloudburst
[5:23:56] derry10: so you cast it, and then store 3 spells, and then cast it again to use all 3
[5:23:56] Lasidor: use CD>Cast>CD
[5:24:01] duffluv22: @noxyll exactly
[5:24:09] grimmy17: try it with the dream flight

[5:24:53] exziled: the throughput seems really low though in between bursty CDs
[5:24:57] wisplingz: how is scaling of SL dungeons atm ? Is it possible to test the class at there at least :D
[5:25:04] exziled: I think it'll be more balanced than anticipated in raid

[5:27:23] d1stract10n: yeah it would be broken
[5:27:24] CrunkyBrewster: yeah I would sya
[5:27:25] Balkep: it would've been too insane
[5:27:26] Zienvyi: but you stored 2 emerald blossoms atleast xD
[5:27:31] sir_skaeg: doing 3x blossom seems really insane tho
[5:27:34] diaperman42069: dude imagine if it did the dream flight in reverse so you went back to your og position
[5:27:47] MagicMonte: Not even op, just how would the game reconcile your positioning?  Do you fly back the other way ?
[5:27:47] K3ks112: there is no time tho?
[5:27:48] MorningNickness: Not gonna lie, this is the first expansion to get me back to WoW since MoP
[5:27:49] K3ks112: or?
[5:27:49] d1stract10n: no time cap for casting the 3 spells
[5:27:52] heypnuts: probably just all stationary healing are stored
[5:28:03] d1stract10n: there is no time limit to do the 3 casts
[5:28:04] ZeusDNA: I think it has to be within 30 seconds of casting the storing spell
[5:28:07] vargath_: and what the third ulti?
[5:28:10] Balkep: the server died because of the healing experiments LUL
[5:28:18] MorningNickness: Most promising xpac since MoP imo
[5:28:18] matx83: but then you can't do any other heals whilst you wait for the cd
[5:28:22] Texas_Mizfit: alpha seems really stable
[5:28:23] Arendiel_: but how long you can store those heals ?
[5:28:28] DidderX: it's only spells cast in the next 30 sec. you can fit 2 if you're doing no other healing then
[5:28:30] MorningNickness: Now i'm questioning whether I'm gonna stick with Wrath classic or play this
[5:28:37] wisplingz: can you try on SL dungeons ? @Towelliee
[5:28:54] grumpnamedjosh: Emerald blossom 3 times for 3x the amount of rng
[5:29:04] Darkbrute: no time limit
[5:29:10] Balkep: LUL
[5:29:10] d1stract10n: lol
[5:29:10] Rabiahtaro132: Does that not have a timer?
[5:29:15] heypnuts: holy shit
[5:29:15] Zellya: Kekw
[5:29:17] CrunkyBrewster: dude LUL
[5:29:18] Exoduc: Some cough you got there
[5:29:18] Murlock07: hehe
[5:29:23] Silverwards: brb maining Evoker
[5:29:23] d1stract10n: do 3 of the bouncing spell
[5:29:25] halfblood74: omg
[5:29:28] FergusCreative: how do you think alpha phases will work? 6 phases do you think they'll come out weekly?
[5:29:29] derry10: no time limit to store, is there a time limit to use after all 3 are stored?
[5:29:56] bvbdragon: now we need a dungeon and tow heals
[5:30:11] b00mkind: what about the BLACK though
[5:30:14] zgag: If you're overwhelmed I'm wondering how that will work with casual players
[5:30:15] Rhonabu: @derry10 no time limit to store, but 30sec to use the stored
[5:30:18] Exoduc: Fun? dont let them hear  RareParrot
[5:30:28] Rabiahtaro132: You'd have to wait 12 minutes.

[5:30:30] zgag: Will they find it fun ect
[5:30:31] louielouie_l: You cant do anything in between the casts tho
[5:30:35] Velashen: That is a great thing then. Will keep people interested in playing if it has depth.
[5:30:51] matx83: but you are then waiting doing jack shit for 3 mins :D
[5:30:54] acreal: seeing the talent trees return is th best "i told you so" to blizzard lol
[5:30:54] avat707: imagine the healing burst in raids. for certain scenario
[5:30:56] Mockle: how are these spells in the game and then there also exists bear game play which is thrash only lol
[5:31:34] mini2506: Is it like worgen when ur in human form and start combat u change to dragon form ?
[5:31:34] zgag: Max brought up that point yesterday.  How will casual players react to the new tree system
[5:31:41] Balkep: machine gun healing
[5:31:49] Zellya: BRAP BRAP
[5:31:51] Zellya: PEW PEW
[5:31:53] Exoduc: try again but move while you do it :D
[5:31:54] grimmy17: Huuuuuuge
[5:31:59] Exxcar: do the flower!!
[5:32:02] SJC1878: Just tuned in, how does it feel so far?
[5:32:03] marygiggles: reminds me of a frozen orb almost
[5:32:04] grimmy17: Those orbs slow down when they hit an injured person too
[5:32:06] Exxcar: ALL THE RNG
[5:32:15] pronkk_: this looks PoEish
[5:32:18] kyr_slowbro: Most are just followers. Still sorta fun to try their own build though.
[5:32:18] Balkep: @Exoduc drive by healing LUL
[5:32:20] Kale_Nd: wowhead, youtube, icyveins or any other site, that is how casuals will respond
[5:32:20] crawds: they gonna icy-vein builds
[5:32:22] SaulMDGaming: I will do what I use to do... read websites, watch videos, etc.
[5:32:23] Velashen: @zgag Easy. They will copy other peoples ideas. Templates are a thing.
[5:32:25] RiptoreCA: Just trust the guides from icy veins or something
[5:32:28] Texas_Mizfit: 3 emerald blossums will be crazy
[5:32:29] belaham: casuals will do what they always do...look up guides and just follow what they say
[5:32:30] Brodih_: there will be a million guiders byt the time it comes out
[5:32:31] Daarksyde: did those go farther than the initial ones casted?
[5:32:32] marygiggles: whats poe
[5:32:34] wwwyzzerd: nah this type of stuff is in assassin creed and horizon games
[5:32:35] oldkingcolebaby: Casuals will look up a guide and follow that
[5:32:36] spiceyholo: they will just go to Icy veins and find the best build xD like ppl done since start of wow.
[5:32:36] mini2506: Is it like worgen when ur in human form and start combat u change to dragon form ?
[5:32:36] Hronak: @Towelliee are all talents out for all classes/specs?
[5:32:43] joe_g_433: They will look at icy veins and call it a day
[5:32:44] grumpnamedjosh: Emerald blossom x3 will be where it’s at
[5:32:47] PhatManPyro: they be just fine they will do what the always do and just copy Wowhead's guides
[5:32:48] ZyntosAran: another turtle made it into the water?
[5:32:48] Musty_Kutsy: so...3 emerald blossom?
[5:32:50] Xann_: throughput spiritshell
[5:32:51] Malkyr: Yeah. The Classic trees were filled with a bunch of useless +.1% crit type stuff. All of these buttons seem like gas so tons of hard choices
[5:32:52] acreal: @spiceyholo exactly
[5:32:55] akia03: do you have a battle rez or just normal rez
[5:32:55] ZyntosAran: the cycle of life is cruel
[5:32:56] K3ks112: cloudburst
[5:32:58] Suwah84: literally cloudburst
[5:33:02] elunesdruid: it's basically what mushrooms did for resto druids in the past
[5:33:05] Malkyr: @PhatManPyro Yeah this probably
[5:33:15] b00mkind: i just want to know about the black dragon power
[5:33:17] cellarrr: remove grove tender?
[5:33:18] deliriumvoid: yeah exactly just will look up best build and copy paste
[5:33:21] acreal: they've built the entire game around min/maxxing, so most players will just do that via google for their trees
[5:33:22] Joefoshow15: I feel like it may be a lot to take in but once you start placing points each spot seems pretty straightforward (talent trees)
[5:33:23] vargath_: sure
[5:33:24] sir_skaeg: remove the ball
[5:33:30] vargath_: triple
[5:33:41] Texas_Mizfit: get rid of grove
[5:33:45] cellarrr: remove grove tender
[5:33:46] sir_skaeg: left part of bottom middle
[5:33:51] Texas_Mizfit: rewind cd
[5:33:54] grumpnamedjosh: So statis and than emerald blossom x3 will leave behind 3 saplings
[5:33:56] Mr_Ignotus: the left one, on 8th row
[5:33:58] zgag: Problem with following guides that Max brought up is there could be tons of possibilities.  That means a casual might have to look at 100 + guides
[5:34:06] sir_skaeg: the grove tender
[5:34:09] sir_skaeg: jsut get rid of it aswell
[5:34:12] Simajz: just dont remove left part in middle u will do middle part  when u go only right
[5:34:16] zgag: Will a casual want to look over 100+ guides
[5:34:16] sir_skaeg: and take bottom right
[5:34:22] K3ks112: full right one with choose
[5:34:23] T0nKa7a: @Towelliee take only rewind cd on 3rd roll down from the bottom
[5:34:26] Mr_Ignotus: you dont need Grobe
[5:34:33] Simajz: yep like this
[5:34:33] Joefoshow15: @zgag sounds like a good problem to have
[5:34:42] Malkyr: They wont, Wowhead will have a "do this for raids" guide even when it is wrong everyone will do it
[5:34:50] Musty_Kutsy: huge
[5:34:50] nephttv_: Neph__98 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[5:34:51] zgag: @Joefoshow15 That
[5:34:53] Texas_Mizfit: yes
[5:34:55] vargath_: should be
[5:35:01] jmn115: 6
[5:35:01] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:35:02] acreal: @zgag doubtful. they'd have to balanced for that to occur. i expect a very clear "best spec".
[5:35:02] sir_skaeg: and what if the spreading also drops sprouts
[5:35:06] sir_skaeg: seems like insane combo
[5:35:09] sliproach: only one way to find out
[5:35:09] zgag: @Joefoshow15 That's the thing.  A casual player might not see it that way
[5:35:17] Aimessan: Aimessan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[5:35:19] SaulMDGaming: @zgag Thats exactly what I did back in Vanilla/TBC/Wrath. Sits like the forums, ElitestJerks, etc. Then you have IcyVeins, Wowhead, and other community sites.
[5:35:20] bren92: Why would you ever need that much healing :P
[5:35:26] Kickingsite: pooping seeds
[5:35:47] nyroxieu: ELITIST JERKS and maintankadin where BIS
[5:35:47] Joefoshow15: @zgag but if youre playing casually you probably arent going to wowhead to min max
[5:35:52] Wcvechten: imagine if all of that procced more lmao
[5:35:54] sir_skaeg: the extra blossoms also pops seeds
[5:35:56] sir_skaeg: oh god
[5:36:06] RiptoreCA: Level cap 68 right now?
[5:36:09] zgag: Towelliee mentioned POE.  Has anyone ever gone to the POE forums and seen how many guides are out there
[5:36:12] Rhonabu: 6 seeds KEKW
[5:36:12] BlewGamingGroup: popping that in raid would be op
[5:36:15] RiptoreCA: What was rough time 65 to 68?
[5:36:21] sir_skaeg: the capstone u just took also makes seeds
[5:36:22] deliriumvoid: @zgag naw it will be same as always couple builds will be top for their situation
[5:36:23] diaperman42069: new seed of corruption
[5:36:27] sir_skaeg: that capture healing :O
[5:36:36] Joefoshow15: @zgag I just think more customization the better so everyone can play the way they want
[5:36:47] herzlustafir: Might just go healer next expantion looks kinda effectiv
[5:37:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: maxroll is gonna cover the next poe league
[5:37:12] SaulMDGaming: @NioraEU I lived on that site in college. Always theorycrafting and reading posts
[5:37:13] Malkyr: @Joefoshow15 But they cant, they will all folllow the same guide even when the guide isnt exactly optimal
[5:37:16] Coughing_Coffin: Delay the 3 stored blossoms until you can cast another one
[5:37:22] cellarrr: Stasis -> Emerald Blossom x 3 -> Stasis -> Emerald Blossom -> Dream Breath, Temporal Anomaly, Spirit Bloom
[5:37:23] Animemron: I love the new talent system. The current one is way too simplistic
[5:37:33] Lasidor: @Towelliee You should test that in Org.  People all over lol
[5:37:48] avatar_kevin: 10 yards is the circle thing

[5:38:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the circle is 10
[5:38:08] haneything: you had 4 seeds
[5:38:16] haneything: it was your buffs

[5:38:17] Zayvion: looks super fun
[5:38:17] Balkep: some really cool spells
[5:38:17] RiptoreCA: It looks like a totally new healing style.
[5:38:20] xraynibba: awsome cant wait to try it
[5:38:20] RiptoreCA: FInally
[5:38:21] Rabiahtaro132: It looks really cool

[5:38:25] Aquadriel: looks quite unique
[5:38:26] samuel_cunning: OMG I cant wait
[5:38:29] Zettabyte: #FunDetected
[5:38:30] Joefoshow15: @Malkyr thats where it comes down to blizz to actually make it to where different tree builds are viable and serve a unique purpose...im sure ill end up following a guide when my shitty build crashes and burns lmao
[5:38:33] zgag: I can see it changing quite a bit between here and release
[5:38:33] stallowned: seems really fun
[5:38:35] Musty_Kutsy: It looks very versatile and fun
[5:38:41] Balkep: that spell sequence ability is pretty insane in the right hands
[5:38:42] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @zaetemira (warning)
[5:38:48] Texas_Mizfit: looks fun to play
[5:39:07] BlewGamingGroup: pretty sure stasis is going to be a must have talent
[5:39:10] zgag: Max saw the bottom right skill (Evoker points) being a must have in a raid
[5:39:11] Zienvyi: but where is the strong instant heals, like Hpala Wings and Holy Shock?
[5:39:25] Suwah84: do they have a single target heal?
[5:39:30] Balkep: yeah, stasis makes my disc priest hand sweaty - the amount of prep I can do with it
[5:39:30] Dratomae: Problem with that is you'd have to wait way too long between dream breaths
[5:39:36] RiptoreCA: So all the heals are skill shots?
[5:39:44] DigitalChill: towHi towSip
[5:39:52] Rabiahtaro132: Living fire is a single target heal.
[5:40:05] Mad__Parrot: @Towelliee In your opinion (just guessing at this point) where would Heal-Voker land on healers tier list?
[5:40:22] Balkep: jesus LUL
[5:40:23] Luxicake: wtwf
[5:40:25] Dratomae: Maybe a combo of dream breath, emerald bloom and spiritbloom
[5:40:26] Dreija: cuppWow
[5:40:27] StalkerBub: WTF
[5:40:27] Lasidor: Quad halitosis
[5:40:28] sifer007: KEKW
[5:40:35] shallbak: was a full breath ?
[5:40:43] Wcvechten: talk about burst aoe healing lmao
[5:40:53] quakegoogl: EnlightenD
[5:41:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: It looks like there is a skillcap with getting the most out of the burst healing
[5:41:08] DigitalChill: Vorian81 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[5:41:09] Joefoshow15: I do enjoy how evoker seems to be very unique and not a typical class found anywhere and everywhere
[5:41:10] Zienvyi: they need more Single target heals or no?
[5:41:19] Valmurai: yes
[5:41:20] Lasidor: The ultimate troll cd
[5:41:23] Alienfromger: try it :)
[5:41:26] rivera9: ... "to pandaria"
[5:41:29] alex12645: LUL
[5:41:33] Kickingsite: fly them back 3 expansions
[5:41:35] sir_skaeg: @Zienvyi their single target healing is living flame
[5:41:37] Suwah84: if dream flight didnt work I doubt that did
[5:41:47] rivera9: MARTY we goota GO BACK
[5:42:00] RiptoreCA: KEKW
[5:42:02] wisplingz: @Towelliee create a group for mythic gambit tank can pull everything and you can test healing at there prolly
[5:42:07] thefastestsnail: @towelliee can you queue shadowlands dungeons on alpha?
[5:42:16] Valmurai: I saw some drag to cliff
[5:42:17] d1stract10n: wait in capture the flag can you carry the person 3 times lol
[5:42:24] Zienvyi: @Zienvyi So only 1 and lots of AoE? :o
[5:43:15] sir_skaeg: @Zienvyi then they have a hot for ST healing aswell, rescue is also ST healing but on a 17 sec cd
[5:43:27] chulklol: whats that air behind you @Towelliee ?
[5:43:29] Balkep: alpha testers, btw Kappa
[5:43:32] Joefoshow15: try general chat
[5:43:33] d1stract10n: shity ones
[5:43:35] Alienfromger: imagine testing on alpha KEKW
[5:43:38] BlewGamingGroup: imagine testing abilities on an alpha test server
[5:43:38] Atma23: The real reason WoW is dead, the community
[5:43:45] RiptoreCA: If your char name was Towliee maybe they would be more inclined. LUL
[5:43:49] blackoutking: do a barrel roll
[5:43:54] Xindii: monkaS
[5:43:54] Zippaya: they just want advantige when it launch, they dont give a fuck for any testing :D
[5:43:56] sir_skaeg: @Zienvyi oh yea and echo is also ST healing for your essence spending on ST
[5:43:59] CrunkyBrewster: FINALLY

[5:45:26] Molvonos: That's disappointing
[5:45:31] Mockle: can you carry someone over a ridge and kill them? lol
[5:45:34] Rabiahtaro132: Stasis is cool though.
[5:45:43] Rabiahtaro132: Very fun and flexible talent.
[5:45:43] zgag: I really wouldn't call Wow dead.  Wow no doubt took a hit with SL , but it's still one of the top MMO's  In terms of total players Wow is on top.  Active top 3 which will probably chance with DF
