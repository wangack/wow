[0:32:53] SippinSimpSyrup: @ziqoftw do you believe
[0:32:57] THEPROFESS9R: every drug is a gateway if you lean towards drugabuse and your social enviroment supports it

[0:34:02] Sqwibbie: easy answer. Tobacco is bis
[0:34:07] littlepablo13: littol monkatiwest payoM
[0:34:09] Bappster: alcohol and tabacco are the r1 gateway drugs

[0:34:15] Soupwtf: alcohol is the gateway druglol
[0:34:20] radassbadass69: whether someone gets way into hard drugs or not has a lot more to do with being deeply unhappy
[0:34:27] Nuggnuts: each individual person is unique to what their "gateway" is some people will smoke tobacco and never weed or try weed and never do anything harder
[0:34:36] mpeno_xoris: strose mpeko
[0:34:36] liljizza: idea of gateway drug is just a meme pushed by politics
[0:34:36] layziep: Probably right honestly

[0:34:42] dizzypeezy: kurwa mac
[0:34:43] gawnerz: @radassbadass69 Not everyone, you can use "hard" drugs with responsibility
[0:34:43] SippinSimpSyrup: Life is a gateway drug
[0:34:46] Soupwtf: will power and discipline
[0:34:47] wickiiit: for sure, alcohol is where it starts
[0:34:49] Fried1ord: i am pro legalization but just a thought
[0:34:58] layziep: I personally didn't start tobacco until later in life but you're probably right in terms of it being the thing kids first go to
[0:35:01] radassbadass69: @gawnerz I said "way into". I've dabbled myself with some stuff

[1:05:07] aSteamedTomato: KEKW on that topic, we're actually simming spellpower hunter atm, and chimera is kind of funny. It's doubling serpent scaling. So SP hunter is simming higher than regular MM

[1:06:59] willertons_: can we get some gy traps
[1:07:09] aSteamedTomato: wyvern doesn't scale, sadly

[1:37:36] OneHundredFists: hey that guy who banned u is using a bot to stay as admin in world chat, and he kicks everyone wanting to lfg or use it for trade, and he lets toxic people hate on women and society in chat 24/7 (not exaggerating). Please report him to blizzard
[1:37:49] Viccili: world chat is useless they dont want you to LFG in world chat so they ban if you if try.

[1:38:41] mealtiime: just dm new Blizzard CEO
[1:38:50] fanofthebanhammer: oh really? all ppl on living flame EU are spamming about LFG

[1:42:00] ladyb0y420: it lags, because you dont filter the settings, you have everything checked out as deafult, only need gnomeregan + trade chat
[1:42:03] DaaamnTV: sp is hero class
[1:42:06] mealtiime: they really have to add dual talents
[1:42:09] fanofthebanhammer: Ziqo i do a lot of pugs, so a tip is to always write NO HR/SR cause priests have a lot of options, they like that a lot

[2:33:12] ElGompers: If 2 people roll the same number, do you re-roll or something else?
[2:33:14] darko367: i just hope they keep adding too sod after 60 quests, items, new mobs maybe anytthing
[2:33:22] xMentoss: i think TBC will be a part of SOD  and them making a tbc era server would just oversaturate it
[2:34:01] bassiemon123: No they shouldnt fk with tbc, its great expansion. Atleast pvp wise
[2:34:18] jhk97: @xMentoss i really hope SoD doest become TBC SoD
[2:34:24] haileyxzx: man i cant choose on making a mage or a boomkin lol
[2:34:34] mooloos: @haileyxzx mage mage mage mage

[2:35:23] opinionatedfairy6669: so on this serv does al l dungions scale up ?
[2:35:27] bassiemon123: Btw blizzard not knowing what to do with shamans, giving alpha 30% ap bonus to whoever gets it. How is this a good idea LUL
[2:35:30] haileyxzx: thanks guys😄
[2:35:32] retrovideogamesus: @ziqoftw AI
[2:35:36] Maifraind: good stream ziqo
[2:35:41] jhk97: @mooloos they lose the +30% damage when wielding 2 of the same weapon type i think
[2:35:46] bassiemon123: And yet the resto shamans still waiting patiently
[2:36:54] MrChrisJoe: turn off ingame music xd
[2:36:55] Stars69: lf resist, its a wipe
[2:37:02] jhk97: @bassiemon123 isnt it 30% ap for the shaman if he gives alpha to someone else? people have been saaying shamans are gonna give alpha to healers
[2:37:35] bassiemon123: Nope
[2:37:47] bassiemon123: Cant get it urself
[2:37:49] mealtiime: its good
[2:37:50] Nazhjin: spirit of alpha gives AP buff to the shaman not the caster
[2:37:54] mealtiime: it buffs shammy
[2:38:06] jhk97: @bassiemon123 pretty sure you misunderstood it OR they changed it again
[2:38:10] carnnezz: it will give 20% to sham tomorrow
[2:38:12] Nazhjin: threat to whoever its on but shaman gets 20% ap on themselves
[2:38:13] mealtiime: it does to the target
[2:38:14] carnnezz: 20% AP
[2:38:17] Hawksworthers: in the reset it also gives the sham ap
[2:38:19] bassiemon123: Spirit of the Alpha rune now grants the casting Shaman 20% increased Attack Power if they cast the spell on a target other than themselves.
[2:38:26] ghazban1: ye, 45% threat
[2:38:30] bassiemon123: Ye they changed it to 20 seems
[2:38:31] zPeshy: yes youre right
[2:38:39] jhk97: @bassiemon123 this says the shaman gets the ap
[2:38:48] zugmadonk: iceblock the breath
[2:38:50] mealtiime: it only will
[2:38:52] Nazhjin: if blizzard overlooked rockbiter buff then shamans are going to be insane so hopefullyits base AP
[2:38:52] bassiemon123: Yess ur right
[2:38:55] ghazban1: the AP is new
[2:39:08] Qrucials: its the new buff coming tomorrow
[2:39:11] bassiemon123: Reading is hard guys mb
[2:39:15] bassiemon123: SeemsGood

[2:40:30] BlueZense: direct drop from pve
[2:40:32] jhk97: i dont have a set item either but i have the pve legs with -stamina xD
[2:40:34] zugmadonk: synergize the proc with combust+helmet
[2:40:41] zugmadonk: +Power infusion
[2:40:48] johnnypoison69: 3 pc gives 40 sp proc
[2:40:50] radassbadass69: yeah I think they realized BFD gear was too good and they're trying to avoid super power creep
[2:40:52] relodilodingdong: is bm melee now the best hunter spec?
[2:40:53] fafoo204: everything adds up, but its def not a huge spike
[2:40:57] Sohvaperuna2: ALERT2 refresh oil + elixir + firepower + int

[2:44:29] moosywow: did they increase the ice Lance range?
[2:44:39] jhk97: apparently the pve set has a chance to drop off every boss
[2:44:40] Sohvaperuna2: oil weapon BirdgeStare
[2:44:40] Pyroheet: oh thats nice thanks
[2:44:43] jhk97: unless i was lied to

[2:51:43] illumnalol: @hallojjx but you are queuing the raid as ms healer
[2:51:45] hiro25000: the healers one is easiest to get  since they are obtainable by tokens
[2:51:49] Scoffered: LEFT*
[2:51:52] Wutanggggg: those tokens are still viable for all the hit that you need
[2:51:54] daLuhz: healers are heavily deprioritized in sweaty pve guilds anyways

[2:55:22] ottersarepeopletoo: ziqo 100% right
[2:55:22] cheesysub: thats how it is

[2:57:53] 1FrostyWalrus: YEP
[2:57:54] cheesysub: @cheevzzz because you're in the raid as a healer?

[2:57:57] cheevzzz: this chat all 80 parsers its funny
[2:57:58] berks1136: I think it’s pretty standard for “healing and damage increase” gear is dps while the “only healing increased” gear is for healers
[2:57:59] BeakTooth: YEP

[2:58:35] hallojjx: well priest healers are dpsing too?
[2:58:46] Coldfare: Healers not doing dmg should be banned from loot anyway tbh
[2:58:46] hiro25000: guys literally read only what they want. Check closer on the list what is the BEST healing item.
