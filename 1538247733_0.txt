[1:10:13] futomara01: nobody activly mines skins or herbs anymore...

[1:10:22] ogcals: dont worry you've got Wrath coming for that
[1:10:26] sliproach: fishing in bear form added yet ?
[1:10:32] strchsr: @Towelliee Hey John Blizzard, just make it so everyone can mine/herb/skin/fish without having to learn it as a skill, how hard could it be to hit rocks or touch grass?
[1:10:33] nvnto: at least twice? Kappa
[1:10:37] bigoldmeatpie: can't even use that argument anymore since the commodities are region wide. the economy won't change with everyone having secondary professions
[1:10:47] Tamz_tv: yup

[1:10:51] Moobot: @Sollice No we don't have DF keys....yet....Check with Sloot or PandaTV. They have them for sure. Don't let them tell you otherwise. If and when we get key's Towelliee will let you know
[1:11:09] captiv8: Maybe have all 3 secondary professions but only one primary.
[1:11:11] Keyastaron_: @towelliee I was thinking about that all gathering professions should be secondary .... alchemy , blacksmithing, tailoring , leather working engineering be primary so we can 2 primary professions

[1:14:50] KaisenSiru: Alpha Pog
[1:15:26] nightwolf_87: why blizz dont allow bandit guild, where you can make a bandit guild out side of capital cities, which makes you enemy of your own capital and the same time you can loot and steal from SW vendors etc. on the other hand, you can apply for scouting and support SW guards to protect SW from these bandits, which will make you able to fight your own faction ( bandits) for gold and honor.

[1:16:20] Thoreya: they should make a separate playlist for m+ in DF. a separate group of dungeons where players can do m+ for fun and not get gear from. would be dope

[1:17:30] scumlucki: @nightwolf_87 because that sounds fun and you know how blizz feels about fun
[1:17:41] thepaladinjournal: why would they do an m+ system without loot?
[1:17:57] scumlucki: @vorianloken cause peoplelike a challenge probablyidk
[1:18:14] Thoreya: bc i think people would love to do freehold and other good m+ dungeons that once they have good loot they can just do for fun
[1:18:19] scumlucki: What we really need is drgaon racing against other players
[1:18:23] jasonbriggs: m+will have loot
[1:18:26] thepaladinjournal: if people like a challenge they can just roll into a +20 with 233 cypher gear, nothing stopping them

[1:19:07] Molvonos: @Thoreya I don't feel that would be nearly as popular as you think it is.  Without the motivation of loot, I definitely have no interest in doing M+.  My guildies and I do other stuff as a community.
[1:19:30] strchsr: @Towelliee Ah yes, perfect, an hour in the dark, an hour on Wowhead News, gives me time to get my Uber Eats and get ready for testing Heroic dungeons

[1:27:47] Meeckah: There was a lot of salt about this reply but I like it - we should do more low level cooldowns etc cos messing up in your cooldown is too punishing otherwise
[1:27:52] all_res_underscore: its ok to waste procs -blizzard 2022
[1:28:10] Mikromanagement: its just that the only reason trueshot has been a good cooldown has been cause theres been good things alongside it (think of azerite trait in bfa, spirits in shadowlands) and they also have some anti synergy talent nodes around trueshot in the DF talent tree

[1:31:39] Dark_lite7: It only lasts that fight,, think it's for 45 seconds

[1:48:48] KrychaStrimer: @Towelliee do you think there is a chacne they can implement one "gathering profession" in DF or is it already too late?

[1:52:21] Dexesz: @TheCliffyShow I feel you, have been signed up for alpha for the last 3 expansion and never got into alpha ones

[1:53:01] Lasidor: @truman0725 totally agre
[1:53:15] TheCliffyShow: @Dexesz Only alpha/beta I've ever gotten into for WoW was the Lich King beta. Granted, I did leave the game for several years.

[1:53:20] andrejhmm: CONVENIENTLY PACKAGED INGREDIENTS = SOUNDS LIKE WALLAMRT KEKW
[1:53:27] Nixis: @towelliee what do you think of the new professions system? Where you can request items to be crafted for you?
[1:53:33] cswowko: @wesosdqueso i dont think focusing on " reality " is good in WoW
[1:53:35] poklepkin: don't worry about alpha invites, other people will play for you. enjoy twitch content
[1:54:04] blade_killa: true
[1:54:13] rudericus: more bots!
[1:54:16] Dexesz: @woahTJENNE true, but would be fun to at least get into one alpha
[1:54:17] WoWLeia: cant see trade from all booster spam

[1:54:24] Hydere: Third wave alpha when? :P
[1:54:30] valarbravoosi: in KR, that translates to more bots very likely peepoSad
[1:54:36] Nixis: True, would make it more fun also to master a profession
[1:54:40] Eviltuna13: Sad no archeology this expansion would be perfect with dragon themed items
[1:54:49] backstreetalright: Maybe
[1:54:51] andrejhmm: I got into Alpha for Shadowlands and never played it once.
[1:54:55] almostdps: finish agent
[1:55:08] dyslexican1: Honestly im looking forward to chilling and doing professions between content, on live currently I find pref boring and really dated. if they were interesting I might do them more. They are just so mindless RN
[1:55:18] strchsr: Monday
[1:55:34] Nixis: @eviltuna13 yeah! I really liked that profession.
[1:55:59] therealbrigade: Towelliee your so dark on the cam

[1:56:53] munchie66: very few people did archaeology though
[1:56:56] pavepawns: what if they are saving archaeology for the underground patch
[1:56:57] dyslexican1: Yeah its so weird that they didn;t capitolize on it when they focued on professions.
[1:57:00] darkwaves: later in the expac hopefully
[1:57:05] Fyeah: Archaelogy would be a 100% fit for this expa
[1:57:08] andrejhmm: @Towelliee The lighting is fine. You look smexy with the lights in the back. LUL
[1:57:21] procyon_mfc: They said maybe 10.1 or 2

[2:08:03] voordeelpot: @Mikromanagement damn blizz trying their best this time

[2:08:16] doomester: @Towelliee so everyone will be able to have two proffisions while having all gathering ?
[2:08:17] Scoodles91: a lot of gold to buy mats from the AH :D

[2:13:35] NEMERL: @Towelliee one thing i missing right now is Weapons/Armors etc. should be divided for more category. For example Great Axe separately, Swords separately etc.

[2:16:48] Honvar: @Awesm_mossm The one you like the most.
[2:16:59] Tomaterrs: emberon should be interesting
[2:17:26] JBonezey: I hope that BDK isn't the best tank the entire xpac like it has been
[2:17:37] Awesm_mossm: @honvar ok how about this the best dps class that has a utility secondary spec like tanking or healing just in case
[2:17:40] kay0234: @Flytrum its so random, I don't think there really is a way to tell. Right now, a lot of current game materials is dropping significantly in price.

[2:19:24] Mecabeast: I thought 304 was the mythic ilvl?
[2:19:28] Kisswani: maybe that reinforces that this is gonna be a prepatch dungeons ? @Towelliee
[2:19:33] RocketMan23: 304 is baseline mythic ilvl
[2:19:39] Cranxjs: well sure we are maybe on the same itemlvl but new chars wont be

[2:21:36] WoWLeia: where is dmg meter
[2:21:37] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:21:43] WoWLeia: no addons ?
[2:21:45] TheCliffyShow: When was the last time troggs popped up in WoW.
[2:21:46] EllisTheMenace1: Well normally you can't, enter heroic till max level so that's only reason ur getting exp
[2:21:57] mulkon: How is guardian dps with the moonfire build?
[2:22:04] matching_towels: @jhonothesecond likely disabled all addons so users focus on the game, trees, bugs etc. Dps values aren‚Äôt the priority at this stage
[2:22:09] looney199725: dps doesnt matter rn its alpha
[2:22:11] Tamz_tv: @TheCliffyShow BFA
[2:22:12] looney199725: it will all  change
[2:22:35] baaronthemonk: put me in alpha, I will test the crap out of that starting zone
[2:22:45] Alvari: i haven't seen the new starting zone, is it available atm?
[2:22:48] Casual_Oppa: Oh joined the perfect time, Wanted to see the changes to Uld
[2:22:51] Joneeeez: next week we get another alpha build guys, and its a lot two dungs and waking shores zone
[2:22:55] gravlaxxx: i'm sure mrGM has the starting area covered
[2:22:57] TheCliffyShow: @Tamz_tv There was troggs in BFA content?
[2:23:15] Raaeni: on mechagon
[2:23:29] Raaeni: and tiragarde in general
[2:23:36] CoffeeDMG: i love seeing uldaman again. ive spent so much time in that dungeon.
[2:23:43] TheCliffyShow: Oh, I haven't done Mechagon.
[2:23:46] Alvari: 8 dungeon in total?
[2:23:50] Alvari: s*
[2:24:00] Kisswani: Will old uldaman still be available ?
[2:24:10] looney199725: yes
[2:24:10] virevez: !ORIGIN
[2:24:13] cta62: @Towelliee so is Ulda remade just for fun in this xpan or does this fit in the lore somehow?
[2:24:15] looney199725: this isnt deleting any 5 mans
[2:24:19] looney199725: its just adding more
[2:24:25] Kisswani: right
[2:24:29] andrejhmm: @Towelliee The Drachtyr starting area seems fun but too short and it has too little content.
[2:24:44] Synaerio: why fairy bear testing?
[2:24:49] looney199725: @slayer_vvv it fits lore this is were the aspects learn to regain there power
[2:25:03] looney199725: its hidden in the vault of tyr
[2:25:10] Orion280: heroic ilvl only being like 2 ilvl higher than sepulcher fated definitely makes no sense to me seems like ilvl is just weird atm
[2:25:17] cta62: so is this after the events of vanilla ulda or?
[2:25:22] Dzurky: do the dungeons feel more like SL or BFA dungeons?
[2:25:28] AllKindaPillZzz: No Recount?
[2:25:35] DeanoTV: 1 hour and half too short wtf?
[2:25:36] Raaeni: no addons
[2:25:36] Nachkuss: @Dzurky more like dragonflight dungeons
[2:25:40] JBonezey: short and sweet > DK slog
[2:25:41] AllKindaPillZzz: oh
[2:25:44] AllKindaPillZzz: damn
[2:25:47] Kisswani: I thought it was longer than DH
[2:25:50] DeanoTV: its 1 hour and a half, thats plenty
[2:25:54] Raaeni: numbers dont matter
[2:25:55] TheCliffyShow: Panda isn't hero class.
[2:25:57] akromayep: i mean, the dk zone just had a special vibe with the lichking
[2:26:01] andrejhmm: Its better than DH TRUE,
[2:26:06] akromayep: nothing came close since for me
[2:26:09] looney199725: @slayer_vvv yes this is after the events of sl its been 6 years gone since we came back to azeroth

[2:26:14] Hypertitan: yes
[2:26:16] flebbooo: Yeah i hope they atleast give u mount or something like the dh/dk area
[2:26:18] Rawoosh: Pull boss into orb before he enrages
[2:26:24] Hypertitan: before he empowers
[2:26:26] Keyastaron_: 5 mins is nothing anymore
[2:26:32] Hypertitan: i don't think it clears his empower
[2:26:39] Rudric_Ice: @Bruhnders u kill bosses
[2:26:40] Alvari: i hope df is a clean slate for wow
[2:26:41] Hypertitan: all 3
[2:26:47] Rawoosh: One orb removes one debuff
[2:26:50] gelimarr: now
[2:26:51] Orion280: he had a buff where he's immune to 2
[2:26:53] Rawoosh: When all debuffs are gone, next orb will stun
[2:26:54] looney199725: you have to run him thro orbs when he has shield up

[2:26:57] looney199725: so he cant rage
[2:27:02] Hypertitan: it won't do anything if he's empowered
[2:27:03] KilledByAGinger97: can the dracthyr racial be used indoors like in an instance for example? would be pretty funny if they can
[2:27:03] Orion280: he's immune while he's empowered
[2:27:06] ddmcwo: ddmcwo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[2:27:44] Hypertitan: 2 of them clear his shield thing...and the 3rd one stuns and/or puts a damage taken buff on him or something

[2:28:07] htomek: Yo should I lvl a hunter or rogue
[2:28:11] abiduel: who was tyr
[2:28:22] looney199725: tyr was the titan watcher

[2:28:35] JBonezey: Looking forward to stock ui with wa and details
[2:28:40] looney199725: he lost his arm to galakrond
[2:28:49] Norbi33: soo trash can proc 2 time proc right? like it was back in legion?
[2:28:56] looney199725: tyr gave the aspects there power
[2:29:15] EpicBananners: ceiling cast
[2:29:23] JBonezey: tyrs hand in WPL, hes important to the lore and hasn't been covered as much as he deserves
[2:29:42] looney199725: tyr is dead but youll learn about him thro the dragons
[2:29:48] looney199725: hes the reason they are what they are today
[2:30:06] Angsterz: amk mali seni

[2:30:26] Hypertitan: if you have mining it kills it faster
[2:30:27] Tomaterrs: 25 mining
[2:30:38] looney199725: the dragon isle is kinda clueless to all that has happened in the world
[2:30:39] jetributions: or kill it

[2:31:59] Hypertitan: warcraft logs should just add a log for the rock only
[2:32:01] TheCliffyShow: Wrathion is small in the Dracthyr starting zone. He was way bigger in Nya'lota.
[2:32:06] looney199725: since devs said we will find out what corrupted galakrond
[2:32:06] Hypertitan: get them 99 parses on rock

[2:34:43] Zilberg: Using leap of faith to troll people LUL
[2:34:48] Hypertitan: always spins clockwise from what i've seen...so you just start on the other side of it

[2:38:55] looney199725: soar should have no cd like worgans mount form
[2:38:59] bierarnoo: Uldaman quinSmash
[2:39:02] jetributions: soar should be a 1 or 2 min cd
[2:39:07] OviTheGray: on live, wont your dracthyr have the chauffer mount?
[2:39:11] The_Farting_Spaniard: How do you think the Evoker will stack up compared to other healers @Towelliee
[2:39:13] mysteriousm4n: what is the point of soar cd?
[2:39:14] suodubbz: facts
[2:39:20] Orion280: @akia03 i don't think you'll have a mount while doing the starting zone
[2:39:22] RioosLive: Agreed. And not only not soaring, the pathing around the area is awful.
[2:39:25] looney199725: evoker will be busted
[2:39:28] scumlucki: @mysteriousm4n so its not broken?
[2:39:31] looney199725: its toolkit is to strong

[2:39:38] Rabiahtaro132: S
[2:39:44] OviTheGray: you dont need riding skills for the chauffer
[2:39:45] Alvari: will the dragon riding be account-wide?

[2:39:53] Zanzarful: duckWeird
[2:39:53] TweektheProphet: chauffer does not require riding
[2:39:54] looney199725: jp was doing 16-17k as evoker
[2:39:56] akia03: pvp bgs maybe why the cd
[2:39:58] looney199725: its filthy
[2:40:00] bob_the_demon: Or make some type of aura that when you are a new dracthyr and in the starting area the cd for soar is lowered or not there

[2:56:53] KingMarlin4: @robert_332 correct, but it's my understanding we can adjust stuff easily
[2:56:56] vulkankragon: bad news: square enix will introduce nfts into ffxiv despite player protest

[3:21:00] luizbarbosanetom: @Towelliee We can edit the resource bar size?
[3:21:00] Berkilak: Shaman talents seem really messy and unfocued.
[3:21:10] Wolfenhoof: @rucus29 i think this nasty place where people are, no one wants to be there
[3:21:20] valarbravoosi: did those mobs just merge?
[3:21:38] Casual_Oppa: The new dungeon zones are really clean
[3:21:41] MorteaWolf17: @Elseworldz gamer nerd would be better for you?
[3:22:18] Atticus_de: haha your in the dungeon with Sco from method

[3:22:25] looney199725: i wonder when we will get out mega dung for this expac
[3:22:42] mavericks312: the utility in the shaman tree is crazy
[3:22:47] SNaKEBOI: hey that mob had an ability called molten core, 3rd ragnaros fight confirmed?
[3:22:57] mavericks312: @looney199725 could be uldaman tbh
[3:22:59] Nerendis: How much does ilvl increase in season 4?
[3:23:09] Berkilak: @Berkilak Individually, they're fine. It's the structure that I find disorganized.
[3:23:09] Elseworldz: @MorteaWolf17 More like turbo nerd. I'm also into comics and sci fi.
[3:23:10] looney199725: na 5 bosses isnt a mega dung
[3:23:19] shmokindoink: this a new dung?
[3:23:25] doogs44: I'm excited to see what Heroic raid tuning looks like without insta wipe on one mistake/death mechaincs.
[3:23:35] MorteaWolf17: @Elseworldz i dub the king of the nerds
[3:23:35] SNaKEBOI: @mikeysahn no this is deadmines =P
[3:23:51] Hypertitan: @Berkilak they kind of had to do it that way or there wouldn't be any choice at all
[3:24:00] Mecabeast: any other bosses we've fought 3x or more besides kt?
[3:24:04] Elseworldz: @mikeysahn Cataclysm was merely a setback :D
[3:24:16] Hypertitan: @Berkilak choosing and just being able to get all the cool things are different things
[3:24:19] kharnij83: so amazon is making a Fallout tv series
[3:24:37] SirVoro: They are extremely similar
[3:24:41] Elseworldz: Bigwigs > Dbm for me. The default sounds are less obnoxious.
[3:24:42] MorteaWolf17: not going to lie ima watch it
[3:24:56] shmokindoink: are the heroics difficult? @Towelliee
[3:25:08] BarcieTV: @Towelliee are you able to move your druid bar or not in yet?
[3:25:08] MorteaWolf17: that boss lookin pretty cool
[3:25:12] looney199725: this boss is 100% a mount since the the mount journal hes in it
[3:25:29] MorteaWolf17: 0000.1% drop don't worry
[3:25:44] Kriven: Hentai elephant?
[3:25:54] Retiredpvper: does the game feel spammy still and only meaningful damage is during cooldowns?
[3:25:55] feel__alive: nice loot
[3:26:37] budzy_tv: does warior talent are out ?
[3:26:40] mulkon: Is the warrior playing without talents?

[3:28:59] looney199725: the buff is up to 59
[3:29:00] P4weZ: @Kisswani 60
[3:29:02] Lorilath: don't want to hit level 61 remember
[3:29:12] ChanJustWon: I'm on my 3rd character to 60 since the 50% xp buff
[3:29:18] MorteaWolf17: i went from 35 to 60 in about 5 hours
[3:29:28] JBonezey: 8 yards is very close
[3:29:37] Motivess: leveling in shadowlands is so a** though
[3:29:38] Evilbreed83: do I have to turn off leveling or does it not matter right now?
[3:29:39] Robodope: how does the state of the alpha compare to previous alphas? does it feel farther along?
[3:29:41] Evilbreed83: u
[3:29:42] ChanJustWon: as in 3 characters leveled all in the last few days xd
[3:29:45] MorteaWolf17: from 50-60 in like 2 hours i think this was with me being lazy
[3:29:53] ChanJustWon: ^
[3:29:55] Mecabeast: probably only good for melee heavy comps
[3:29:59] Korupcija_: tanks will do dmg? Pog

[3:30:55] MorteaWolf17: this was with skipping the story ofc.
[3:30:56] Korupcija_: you had one boss selected
[3:31:00] SNaKEBOI: i think you had it on only last boss
[3:31:29] Matriakis: @Towelliee I have a 206 warr which I haven't played in almost a year, any point starting now to play again or should I just wait for Dragonflight?
[3:31:43] krausey2: may i ask why everyone on alpha that i have seen is playing bear tank? are they doing really well or?
[3:32:05] NickLeonhearth: Chat, can any1 help me out? do you get renown on new character from killing rares in ZM?
[3:32:09] jasonicusm4: Wastes a global
[3:32:31] Mecabeast: @krausey2 bdk historically feels terrible without high haste
[3:32:32] Truckwood: how do you get on warcraft logs
[3:32:33] Wolfegang16: thats only 1 boss
[3:32:33] Truckwood: i assume an addon is required?
[3:32:37] Chopsor: @Towelliee the talent on the bottom right "After the Wildfire" can you test that ?
[3:32:38] exbang: im pretty sure you dont get renown from Rares
[3:32:39] HiiPPii: @NickLeonhearth no you dont
[3:32:39] Wolfegang16: that was only 1 boss on the other logs
[3:32:40] mayonaes: that was just the last fight
[3:32:55] NickLeonhearth: @HiiPPii sad :( thx
[3:33:13] HiiPPii: @NickLeonhearth np hun :)
[3:33:19] puddypounce: have you tried full maul + ursoc's fury build?
[3:33:22] SuperHaxx: ursoc fury is even buffed in dragonflight and its OP in shadowlands
[3:33:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ursoc's Fury is pretty freakish
[3:33:28] Wolfegang16: ursocs seems a ton better
[3:33:30] LSBreed: the amount healed was so much more with regrowth?
[3:33:31] sliproach: fury! of the bears
[3:33:35] Ezekyler: shhh, don't tell Blizzard
[3:33:43] mayonaes: Ursocs does seem like that play right now
[3:33:47] Keyastaron_: malding out against mald Kappa
[3:33:52] LSBreed: wasn't it like 1mil vs 500k?
[3:33:55] flebbooo: Maul? whats that KEKW
[3:33:58] ChanJustWon: @Towelliee As they say in basketball when a small man is defending a big man "mismatch" LUL
[3:34:05] Keyastaron_: maul*
[3:34:06] burnsie5511: @Oviedange @Towelliee  you press maul when off tanking and capped on rage
[3:34:16] whyabadi: Dream of Cenarius has offhealing potential
[3:34:20] Brynhilderr: is thrash better than maul in single target? not a druid main so dno
[3:34:21] unbreko: u using windows 10 or11?
[3:34:21] Bayne77: fuck maul
[3:34:25] burnsie5511: lmao
[3:34:29] MarquisLek: if you have rage you should use ironfur
[3:34:30] 91Niki: Maul ü§Æ
[3:34:41] SuperHaxx: @Brynhilderr maul hits like 2x harder without the maul dmg talents
[3:34:41] mayonaes: What do you think we optimized over here?
[3:34:44] Gingerprimer: Maul is so trash
[3:34:47] fluh_: i'd rather ramp up 8 ironfurs than hit mual KEKW
[3:34:48] themamadm: are you testing every class>
[3:34:52] Chopsor: why Maul when you can press Ironfur KEKW
[3:34:53] swags67: What would be the best class to learn to tank on?
[3:35:03] Mecabeast: how do you hit maul when you can thrash
[3:35:05] Gingerprimer: @swags67 guardian IMO
[3:35:06] sliproach: @Towelliee the pause is time for you to realise you just F'd up
[3:35:07] Ezekyler: Maul has been useless for years, but Blizzard wants us to like it
[3:35:16] Brynhilderr: @Brynhilderr so it just feels shit to press basically cause of animation
[3:35:17] Nerendis: Maul is still an ability?
[3:35:25] jasonbriggs: have they done paladin yet
[3:35:26] dcmaniac11: Towel was there any changes to orgrimmar this xpac or did it stay the same
[3:35:46] fluh_: they need to let maul proc like mangle, that'd be cool
[3:35:46] Bayne77: maul is like very niche  i use it so occasionally that its an afterthought of an afterthought
[3:36:07] mayonaes: ya
[3:36:08] Ezekyler: og Rage of the Sleeper Kreygasm
[3:36:09] mayonaes: it changed
[3:36:10] atrexy_: you where 70 then
[3:36:14] Nightz101: may elune be with u
[3:36:14] Mockle: yep
[3:36:16] LSBreed: good for grouped aoe fights.
[3:36:21] Strouss: why not maul its more dmg then thrash if it talented. for single target.  mangle mangle mangle maul.
[3:36:54] Talason: haha
[3:37:03] MARTZiiE: have any specs gotten any solid changes ?

[3:41:01] Mecabeast: can't be that interesting to test lvl80 nax
[3:41:06] scumlucki: that expbar is so bare bones
[3:41:23] Maytan26: is blizzard planning to delay this expansion or we will get it this year
[3:41:32] Nachozdood: @Towelliee have not tanked in retail or any past expansions past wrath is it stressful to learn and what tank is best for a newer tank?
[3:41:35] thymos_: @mikeysahn make sure it isnt carrying hiv monkaS
[3:41:47] Kisswani: He's DPSing I think , tank in MDI
[3:42:16] Scoodles91: you just need to learn the routs
[3:42:19] stabzmcgeee: still tanking mdi and M+ but said he hates raid tanking and wants to try out for a dps spot

[3:42:47] stabzmcgeee: naowh probably didnt real;ise it was you with that name haha
[3:42:53] Thoreya: @Maytan26 no, theyve been constantly saying theyre very far into development, and alpha looks pretty done
[3:42:57] Motivess: Dungeon tanking is so much better than raid tanking
[3:43:01] Gurrtug: they enabeled heroic dungeons? :O
[3:43:02] strike879: the difficulty with tanking is not the dungeon but the pugs in your group
[3:43:09] amricatt: @stabzmcgeee who are we talking about?
[3:43:10] Truckwood: @Towelliee I agree tanking is easier, but now theres so much pressure to go so fast which is not for everyone
[3:43:32] stabzmcgeee: @amricatt naowh,, my bad i thought i put that at the start of msg
[3:43:41] dutrockbridge: does the freeze xp thing still exist?
[3:43:47] ChanJustWon: @Motivess BIG FACTS, raid tanking is so sleeper even in mythic
[3:43:54] Nachozdood: lol ill go as fast as any Dps wants long as they have an MD to force my hand

[3:45:01] Mecabeast: I think one route they may go with tier/legos in DF is give you a capstone for free so you can spec into a different capstone
[3:45:19] Nachozdood: is bear still basically 2 button spam? Mangle and swipe?
[3:45:22] ohprawinspree: have you done any dungeons?

[3:48:10] Kloshx: M+ are only harder than mythic raiding in like 28+ or so, but fucking  few ppl are there
[3:48:11] falldrgn: Sloot to Echo confirmed? lol
[3:48:16] Revoca: @Valadian1  so true if you don't know everything about the dungeon or raid its just too much and kinda intimidating
[3:48:17] necree666: What‚Äôs up Towellie
[3:48:36] Skkold: Could you open your talents plz Tow?
[3:48:56] Thoreya: i just think BDGG doesnt have a chance

[3:49:27] Ximora_and_Capy: StepBrothers movie irl LUL
[3:49:44] falldrgn: in all fairness.. the whole tier was rough on everyone
[3:49:49] Tia214: Morning :D
[3:49:49] Mecabeast: watch bdgg wins rwf df
[3:50:07] looney199725: its gonna come down to echo or limit again
[3:50:11] Jaconbacon: i think if the raid doesnt last 3 week straight they will probably do better
[3:50:17] looney199725: but if the raid is easier like devs saying
[3:50:26] smashwow: nah they're not getting paid but they got people trying to do it from what i've heard
[3:50:29] looney199725: then i see limit winning
[3:50:33] zarenadt: teggu and sloot, 2 for price of 1 LUL LUL
[3:50:41] im_capy: reading logs seems to be the make or break LUL
[3:50:43] looney199725: a sprint its limit
[3:50:46] nilo2442: the background of the druid tree looks sick
[3:50:46] looney199725: a marathon its echo
[3:50:51] smashwow: that sloot BOGO
[3:50:54] smashwow: Kappa
[3:50:55] Jahknowme: top end raiding just has to become more accessible
[3:51:00] nick1295: I mean, i'd take it
[3:51:24] Tzarrus: so it's a BOGO lol
[3:51:30] smashwow: top end raiding can't get more accessible when you're dealing with that skill gap and resource gap.
[3:51:38] Mecabeast: trade deal meme right there
[3:51:38] Kriven: i dunno why the eyeball seems creepier on the bottom of the screen instead of on the map
[3:51:58] Jahknowme: fair point!
[3:52:14] scumlucki: Plus the eyeball fking moves
[3:52:22] MaxxFoxx84: Yo Towelliee, I am gonna try tanking in Season 4. Any tips?
[3:52:23] Moobot: No we don't have DF keys....yet....Check with Sloot or PandaTV. They have them for sure. Don't let them tell you otherwise. If and when we get key's Towelliee will let you know
[3:52:29] Bruhnders: can you adjust the size of the xp bar to match the actionbar?
[3:52:33] smashwow: kind of like people just can't really beat Echo in MDI.
[3:52:34] looney199725: at this point i just want sl over and DF out
[3:52:40] scumlucki: Put the eyeball back on the map
[3:52:59] scumlucki: @looney199725 same bro
[3:53:00] doomkry: i think the main thing that stops ppl from trying mythic raiding its the time commitment people think they need to take
[3:53:01] smashwow: you'd have to basically throw everyone on a tourny realm and everyone running blind.
[3:53:16] Alphacy13: make it an event with template characters. No need to fuck us all over for 2 guilds sweatting so much
[3:53:19] Kisswani: for me as a viewer 9 days is great
[3:53:21] Clicklesly: The reset is the biggest issue for the EU/NA conflict though :-I
[3:53:34] looney199725: you say that
[3:53:40] looney199725: but if china started same time as eu and na
[3:53:41] Korupcija_: about time
[3:53:45] looney199725: china would smoke us all
[3:53:45] Tzarrus: i was happy with the 2.5-3 week range that happened this time around.  It gave more guilds to have those resets and made things more interesting.
[3:53:47] Berkilak: Is the Visage form identical in size to Blood Elves/Humans?
[3:53:59] Mecabeast: my guild needs like 6 more dps and maybe a healer before we can do mythic
[3:54:03] scumlucki: A realmreborn
[3:54:04] kingfleshlight: if theres no mandatory weekly crap to increase player power the next tier will already be much improved
[3:54:05] brazkat: @Towelliee how does druid feel tanking wise
[3:54:17] im_capy: rebirth of azeroth(wow)

[3:56:04] Mecabeast: council was thr fight I hated the most in SLs
[3:56:12] Alexm305: 3?! :(
[3:56:16] ChanJustWon: I was in 7 guilds this xpac, 6 disbanded
[3:56:17] mrpresbaby: towHype
[3:56:22] Tzarrus: although i have mixed feelings about Raid Finder though ...part of me just feels like N should be the lowest point, and another part sees the place RF has to try and draw people in to raiding in general
[3:56:26] Alexm305: D:
[3:56:58] imabirdhaww: pantheon was such a cluster f
[3:57:05] looney199725: we got hall of fame and took a break since haha

[4:10:40] looney199725: we missing warrior/mage/dh/lock/pala/monk
[4:10:42] kevdot87: Mage warrior next week
[4:10:49] Scoodles91: @Wolfenhoof totaly fine with that :D
[4:10:54] Jahknowme: Balancing might be pretty sporadic among classes at first with the talent system
[4:11:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: We still need to see Brewmaster with crazy keg smash talents
[4:11:09] LycanKain: 2 classes a week for the next 4 weeks
[4:11:18] Ziddrax: yup
[4:11:23] Norian45: Is this uldaman 2.0?
[4:11:26] Anoia22: @Scoodles91 ok i thought that would be the case hehe
[4:11:27] Poriand: i bet we get something today
[4:11:32] ZonnyArk: warlocks next BBYodaS
[4:11:33] croutomz: i just want warlocks trees so bad
[4:11:42] ChanJustWon: 6 classes left
[4:11:53] looney199725: we just need to be allowed to test lvl 70
[4:11:54] Kriven: bring on the mage tree
[4:11:56] Jahknowme: I say just embrace the idea of making classes feel "fun" and then get the balancing right
[4:11:58] looney199725: low lvl doesnt matter
[4:12:02] looney199725: lvl 70 is were it all counts
[4:12:02] Kson28: dh will be last will be my guess
[4:12:09] kevdot87: Watch warlock absorb DH and demo becomes a tank spec finally lul
[4:12:15] tornbraclet: so there is a chance that not all of the talents would be in alpha
[4:12:16] Norian45: Wait huh this is actually uldaman
[4:12:23] Scoodles91: most likely next
[4:12:25] Norian45: so confused right nopw
[4:12:30] TheHamIsDun: how is bear tank so far?
[4:12:36] scumlucki: @Norian45 yup its uldaman
[4:12:42] Aquadriel: hope we can get some new talents today/tomorrow, even if is just to look about and not test in the alpha
[4:12:44] CaptainAlkohol: "new"
[4:12:46] Kriven: "new"
[4:12:46] HerrehF: I'm getting lost ark vibes xD
[4:12:49] looney199725: im hoping phase 6 is flat lvl 70 testing with tier sets thats the important stuff to balance
[4:12:55] Twankiez1992: pre-patch dungeon?
[4:12:57] Twankiez1992: let's fucking go.
[4:13:01] vluggejaapie89: uldaman legacy of rehash
[4:13:19] Pannekaker: Obviously they wouldn't revamp a dungeon and only use it for a couple weeks max
[4:13:19] warrenny: Ubrs was the same tho
[4:13:25] tornbraclet: i liked the ulda dungeon
[4:13:28] George2001k: @towelliee lol will this destructible rock scale with Fortified?
[4:13:29] EmbraceNext: Looks too long for M+
[4:13:42] warrenny: @cursed13337 Reusing and updating old content isnt a bad thing
[4:13:45] looney199725: people keep saying its to long for m+
[4:13:48] dkenjoyer: WE WILL NEVER BE SLAVES !!! SMOrc
[4:13:51] looney199725: this is the same lenght as dos
[4:14:03] Scoodles91: DoS and ToP are the same
[4:14:13] caffeinator: I don't think watching the dracthyr fire off that beam attack will ever loose it's novelty. I love it.
[4:14:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: F
[4:14:37] Aquadriel: oh is double beam on hc
[4:14:53] warrenny: @dkenjoyer BUT WE WILL BE CONQUERORS üòÇ
[4:14:57] Jahknowme: you have brez if you want it
[4:14:58] TheVigiliance: Seems like a mueh'zala kinda thing
[4:15:01] Ertra: can you rez someone?
[4:15:13] looney199725: evoker dps so squishy
[4:15:23] Aidler: this the heroic version?
[4:15:32] strchsr: this is normal lol
[4:15:46] xFevers: Is bear rotation less mind numbing now?
[4:16:00] Gurrtug: this is the only boss that looks interesting in this dung LUL

[4:16:49] Wolfenhoof: if only  a DD would be alive Kappa
[4:16:52] Aidler: cata dungeon niveau
[4:17:04] Badziee: bear tank op!!
[4:17:10] executeru: no heroic yet ?
[4:17:10] DrinkWater1: This boss fight seems super dope other than how hard that intermission is.
[4:17:15] techsn0w: nice fuckin clutch tow
[4:17:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bear carrying it! gj
[4:17:22] Wolfenhoof: well that was bearable
[4:17:22] dutrockbridge: is the arcane healing noticable?
[4:17:40] RiptoreCA: This boss seems to kill a lot of people
[4:17:40] raye_gaming22: cant wait for this shit at +28 trynical aoeing the grp for 80% a tick
[4:17:45] warrenny: @drinkwater1 If this is heroic tyranical will suck
[4:17:52] LordOverflow: So Rextroy will end up soloing
[4:17:52] atrexy_: imagine the damage in mythic 15+ or something
[4:17:57] Squats3: @Towelliee This boss is a pretty good example of a boss that makes 25 yard healing miserable.
[4:18:24] Squats3: @LordOverflow give it a week form launch. lol
[4:18:25] Sunyankzi: Does this dungeon drop updated versions of the old BoEs like Papal Fez?
[4:18:31] scumlucki: @Squats3 evokers can do a healing version of the flame breath thingy
[4:18:33] 2xVOD: New Bear is so good. I'm so hyped.
[4:18:56] NBK_Sethus: Uldaman is still so great, a true dungeon
[4:18:58] atrexy_: Yea hthe 25y healing isn't a big deal ppl just need too group up
[4:19:20] atrexy_: Yes but once you know the fight just group up
[4:19:37] Thormas0: well they created a short range for  a reason no? in short range they're powerful asf?
[4:19:37] Aidler: @lordoverflow of course. one day Rextroy will pull all raid bosses to the main city and then solo them all together
[4:19:40] Revoca: lol gl pugging  if you want to rely on ppl to be smart
[4:19:41] Squats3: @STK_Lucki everything they do is a 25 yard max though. thats the issue. their kit is good. the range can be a problem
[4:19:48] SirVoro: What drink brand are you working out a deal with again?
[4:19:51] doogs44: instance is a line isnt it?
[4:19:56] ZonnyArk: oof
[4:19:57] Holysal: ppl already hate it on alpha bc how long it is lol
[4:20:02] 2xVOD: I was really hoping for a new wing with updated looks.
[4:20:04] looney199725: half the new so called 5 mans
[4:20:04] Kriven: yeah I would rather have had a new dungeon over this for sure
[4:20:06] looney199725: are old ones
[4:20:07] Norian45: Towelliee did Papal Fez drop yet? Kappa
[4:20:14] MarquisLek: are the 3 dwarfs in the new dungeon
[4:20:19] backstreetalright: Hey man a classic is a classic ikwim
[4:20:24] grumpnamedjosh: Don‚Äôt think anything is wrong with that fight, group needs to stay together or you split healer and than people 100% die cause of it.
[4:20:25] doogs44: imo all instances should be no longer than 25/30 mins
[4:20:34] allwero: this looks like uldaman for me

[4:20:43] warrenny: Im just glad they not afraid of harder content now after sepulcher
[4:20:48] Gurrtug: Neltharius dungeon looks realy cool!!
[4:21:07] BlackbibleTV: Uldaman reskin?
[4:21:14] Gurrtug: @LordOverflow as with past 3 expacks its gonna prob be in middle patch
[4:21:29] im_capy: has mdi viewership been steady over the years? not too sure tbh
[4:21:41] Norian45: Im all up for making the newer dungeons harder
[4:21:44] Pannekaker: I'm still holding out hope that they'll change their minds about not having all the new dungeons in S1 slootCopium
[4:21:53] falldrgn: I don't think this is the last iteration  of the dungeon  tuning wise..
[4:22:01] Aidler: @warrenny they probably made these dungeons before the sepulcher incident
[4:22:03] Kriven: I was hoping they would have changed more with this dungeon
[4:22:07] Revoca: the cave system LOL
[4:22:08] atrexy_: Ohh yeah that was a nightmare

[4:22:37] scumlucki: big dick pulls
[4:22:38] Angryfist40: now brd was a pain in the ass
[4:22:38] WayneG947: I'm pretty sure we just killed bats in here hmm...
[4:22:41] Ant9912: I feel like im one of few ppl that actually liked the maze-like design of WC and Uldaman lol, i never really got lost in them
[4:22:55] RiptoreCA: Is there an AoE target cap for bear tanks on any ability?
[4:22:58] JediNeo99999: @warrenny that's literally what m+ infinite scaling is for
[4:23:04] EmbraceNext: i loved in vanilla having to go here to level up enchanting
[4:23:19] atrexy_: @RiptoreCA no only once there are more you do a bit less dps
[4:23:25] vikingskog: Dire mauil
[4:23:27] vikingskog: maul*
[4:23:28] RiptoreCA: kk
[4:23:30] dutrockbridge: BRD = tired
[4:23:30] geros2013: And that emotion was usually despair
[4:23:37] MR_WYTE: Every dungeon taking like 2+ hours lol
[4:23:38] Nevindaz: KEKW
[4:23:39] procyon_mfc: oh god
[4:23:40] grumpnamedjosh: Full BRD mythic +20 is what I‚Äôm about, have time for 1 run a day
[4:23:41] warrenny: @jedineo99999 Raiding heroic or mythic should have challenge too tho depending on skill level
[4:23:42] Fugazi811: LUL
[4:23:43] Urquhart23: LOL
[4:23:45] kokochris: lol
[4:23:48] Valvax: defend the tauren ffs!

[4:23:51] Ant9912: Lmao my first BRD on classic was like 5 hours long
[4:23:57] WickedNastyGaming: Oh yes..the memories were grand for sure.
[4:24:01] PvtHudson093: or tired and your start BRD and your still there 5 hours later
[4:24:09] Squats3: @Towelliee remember OG gnomer? i did that dungeon when i was a wee child. Fell asleep with the tank on follow. woke up when it was over
[4:24:11] PigPenLen: lol yeah no shit the time that was went poof over the years
[4:24:15] MR_WYTE: MOM!!! More pizza bites!!!
[4:24:18] RiptoreCA: afk boss?
[4:24:32] JediNeo99999: @warrenny and it does? There's thousands of people that don't clear the heroic raid. There's still a finite level of difficulty they can make the raid
[4:24:47] delaine: Way too many hours in lbrs farming the gems for the ubrs key
[4:25:03] mhunt2424: No different from now at the same trinket dropping?
[4:25:34] warrenny: @jedineo99999 So your saying im worried about nothing?
[4:26:05] warrenny: @jedineo99999 can admit raegalon hc sucked tho
[4:26:10] Revoca: the evoker did nothing Yikes
[4:26:24] JediNeo99999: @warrenny I'm saying it's going to be how it's always been. If you are a world top 100 CE raider then the raid is probably not going to be that hard for you. If you barely get AOTC before the end it'll be pretty hard for you.
[4:26:32] Wesley1213: We have to remember when we were all running BRD we were 18 to 20 years younger so 5 hours was ok now that we are getting older time our time is way more of a thinh
[4:26:40] RiptoreCA: Tanks are going to compete for DPS charts? LUL
[4:27:02] Tinie_priest: shadowpriest looking good
[4:27:08] Yil0564: i wonder if mistweaver will be a full fistweaving meele healer....it would be so fun!
[4:27:09] LordOverflow: What kind of gear does those dungeons drop?
[4:27:10] kingxjzeus: great on melee comps?
[4:27:11] Chopsor: ok bad group for that KEKW
[4:27:21] warrenny: @jedineo99999 Thats what im hoping for.just worried theyllgo from that to even casual guilds like mine getting curve in like a month
[4:27:28] Texas_Mizfit: shadow priest and evoker heal themselves
[4:27:34] eatonaround: might be good in raid to do raid heaing for the melee group
[4:27:35] waltermanyballs: I enter dungeon groups with no prior knowledge of the fights to come GIGACHAD. What's a guideM
[4:27:42] scumlucki: @Towelliee check out the alchemy prof equipment
[4:27:50] JediNeo99999: @warrenny I liked heroic rygelon, it wasn't that bad once tanks could survive the orb explosion
[4:28:03] kingxjzeus: even if its just 1-2 other melee dps/dealer it will be useful.

[4:28:04] sharontatestone: Full melee with holy pally would be a mil healing - that's huge
[4:28:14] Tzarrus: so outside of a melee group, it's basically a self heal in dungeons and a group heal for raids
[4:28:16] ChaoticPriest: you're making some real rough estimates considering they are still substantially changes classes and tuning the dungeons. It's almost a moot point to look at the numbers rn
[4:28:18] scumlucki: @waltermanyballs guides are for the weak im prolly the only warrior thats using dragon breath with siegebreaker
[4:28:26] warrenny: @jedineo99999 I dunno it just felt too punishing to me worse then jailor
[4:28:29] strchsr: Unless you're playing blue build
[4:28:33] looney199725: jp had a build for evoker that was doing 16k overall
[4:28:52] waltermanyballs: I learn by dying repeatedly @stk_lucki GIGACHAD
[4:28:57] Î∏îÎ£®ÏπòÏ¶àÎß®: pyre strong
[4:28:59] Shubwub: bro it's so dark in your room you're gonna hurt your eyes! BibleThump
[4:28:59] JediNeo99999: i think blue evoker is better for hese with stuff dying so fast
[4:29:04] strchsr: @Towelliee Wildfire Cluster
[4:29:28] warrenny: Will they split ulda for m+ like the mechagon tazavesh dungeons
[4:29:38] scumlucki: @waltermanyballs If you dont get it the first 5 deaths then you'll get it on the 6th absoulte GIGCHAD
[4:29:49] looney199725: i doubt they will split this
[4:29:56] looney199725: why are ppl wanting a 5 boss dung split?
[4:30:05] Revoca: Firebreath helps heal with one of the talents so its build into the rotation
[4:30:10] looney199725: mega dung have 7+ bosses
[4:30:10] scumlucki: Is there a healer class that does dps to heal others?
[4:30:12] Î∏îÎ£®ÏπòÏ¶àÎß®: are heroic dungeons on Alpha? or only normal difficulty?
[4:30:32] delaine: Yes he's ran heroic earlier
[4:30:33] kingxjzeus: Maybe its meant more for raids?  Or would the melee in raid even be within 8 yards?
[4:30:36] sharontatestone: it would be better to be % based health healing
[4:30:37] strchsr: @Towelliee 3 more runs and we're 62 lol
[4:30:40] RiptoreCA: It should heal like the nearest player or something of the sort
[4:30:44] therad1calbrad1cal: are  you going to check out the dk talent tree? jw
[4:30:49] looney199725: they didnt split top of dos in half those are same as this 5 man
[4:31:05] looney199725: dos has way more trash than this 5 man does
[4:31:20] ashnmsr: so that heals you and all party?

[4:39:29] 91Niki: Agreed
[4:39:29] Architank: @STK_Lucki I'm considering warrior, dk, shaman, and evoker
[4:39:33] DeanoTV: @STK_Lucki undead DK, tauren warrior :D
[4:40:02] Wolfenhoof: A pity, tauren DKs looks dope, i got 3 of them.
[4:40:34] DeanoTV: undead and tauren both look great for plate wearers
[4:40:46] salak_daddy: tauren rogues  gonna be meta
[4:40:50] Mallaes: How did his druid became locked? I was away
[4:40:56] 91Niki: I love undead rogues too
[4:41:02] dkenjoyer: I can't wait for dragonflight music
[4:41:07] Daikanatv: @Mallaes he levelled up
[4:41:14] Mallaes: Ah
[4:41:19] Mallaes: Make sense atm lol
[4:41:29] sliproach: @Mallaes did too much dmg JK he  went over lvl cap
[4:41:30] pant0cratoras: @DeanoTV interesting what do you pick for warlock and mage then
[4:41:40] scumlucki: this music is nostalgic as fuck wth
[4:41:50] scumlucki: Sounds like something i would hear from pirate101

[4:43:23] grumpnamedjosh: Does your DK have the 70 crafted set for dungeons
[4:43:39] Valvax: yey some dk action
[4:43:46] Chiraakitteh: Oversight?
[4:43:58] Diamondead1: @91Niki try 104 on saturday
[4:44:02] ehweron: does DK still run 5 miles behind the rest of the group in dungeons? KEKW

[4:44:57] Valvax: esfandWOW
[4:45:05] Choppsuuey: I need Beta!
[4:45:08] grumpnamedjosh: Probably an incentive to not spam dungeons all week and to actually test the starting zone. Turning on XP makes sure you only have a limited number of runs before you lock your character and have to test something else.
[4:45:10] 91Niki: @Diamondead1 I'm Scandinavian, I don't do well with heat. Anything high 80s and I'm suffering LUL

[4:46:13] Clicklesly: The import/export doesn't work yet, right?
[4:46:28] 91Niki: @PotatoBoyEntertainment It's account flagging, so basically luck. Although if you were in previous alpha / beta, and did good bug reporting, odds seems to be higher ;)
[4:46:37] krausey2: @Towelliee sloot said you had thousands of beta giveaways, was wondering if i could please have 1 for when beta is out :)
[4:46:50] lynixxis: It's only good for Blood.

[4:50:03] Anoia22: Blood are restricted to Two-Handed weapon or they can Dual-wield now?
[4:50:19] lynixxis: Yes. YOu wouldn't run improved DS for leveling. The left side is more important due to the DPS increase.
[4:50:38] furrythighs: wouldnt say it's OP considering how BDK plays
[4:51:52] lynixxis: It's currently OP on Alpha cause you can just spam HS/DS for DRW uptime.
[4:52:12] beyondperfection: yesterday Max was talking with others main BDK and they did pick blood tap @Towelliee
[4:52:29] Davcus09: towF

[4:58:19] Metalcalfe: I still think fury warrior is one of the most fun classes in the game to play. It flows so well
[4:58:20] ChanJustWon: is there a set amount of specializations per profession that we know of? or is it different per prof?
[4:58:24] SusanBoyle03: @Frank4LuLz why do u think that tho
[4:58:35] mavericks312: @Frank4LuLz how so they just said last week every new zone is finished
[4:58:47] DeleldurTV: The thing in legion that made me lover warrior was the lego manawroths bracers, they made you heal for a % of your hp depeing on how much rage you spent, thats my only real gripe with warrior that you are the MOST healer dependatn tank there is

[5:08:07] wastedxtime93: Bet Rextroy could destroy you with a controller lol
[5:08:08] Lightasaurus: I mean, it is elitist. Just because it's the norm doesn't make it not being elitist
[5:08:08] Archiee: LUL THD
[5:08:10] lynixxis: Shots fired.
[5:08:11] RavageTV_: lol
[5:08:11] LesterLinton: LOL
[5:08:12] Aquadriel: Solomonlike you are right, but not gonna invite a casual to a high end activity.
[5:08:12] BafflingRainbow: yeah wow being build on addons makes the console port very unlikely
[5:08:13] dutrockbridge: LUL
[5:08:13] looney199725: lmao

[5:08:31] grannynonny: @bafflingrainbow Ohhh good point!!!!
[5:08:32] xALcaPWNedx: Lol
[5:08:36] BigDiezel: @Towelliee whats to say though that they wont have an addon suite?
[5:08:40] klindatu: We are sorry Mr Lock
[5:08:41] warrenny: Thd has a point...
[5:08:42] Ehrinim: wow on console does not make sense yeah
[5:08:43] PrimalRain: gotta keep the peasants in line KEKW
[5:08:43] innuend0o: but @towelliee , why haven't you taken gorefiend's grasp? Kappa
[5:08:44] Valvax: a man is committed to the grind life
[5:08:46] Rabiahtaro132: Towelliee encourages people to have fun with whatever they do.
[5:08:50] brewgamingtv: lol Idk if he just trolling or being for real xD
[5:08:55] jaacobjames: Good morning towel! how you liking the alpha so far??
[5:08:56] looney199725: they could make a wow spinoff for console
[5:08:58] Sleepylol93: Remember when people got mad they died on Hardcore and they were clicking the spells LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:08:59] looney199725: but wow itself on console
[5:09:02] looney199725: would be terrible
[5:09:17] mavericks312: i mean he isnt wrong
[5:09:23] Gotxiko: nolifer
[5:09:23] danielthegathering: achievement points are endless grind
[5:09:24] procyon_mfc: what twiter is this?
[5:09:26] kashmara: kashmara subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 29 month streak! hype
[5:09:26] Aquadriel: he is reaching greedgodx lvls of bad takes KEKW
[5:09:27] looney199725: i agree with thd
[5:09:28] looney199725: no grind
[5:09:29] Cakeabsorber: if ff can do console why cant wow? :o
[5:09:37] grannynonny: Yeah I don't want it on console, it's the MS buyout that has me concerned
[5:09:38] gritbarontv: not infinite grind, more like infinite content
[5:09:40] mavericks312: @Cakeabsorber addons alone
[5:09:41] looney199725: because
[5:09:44] looney199725: ff was made for console
[5:09:45] looney199725: wow wasnt
[5:09:48] looney199725: thats why
[5:09:53] Mockle: that man fully embraced the sweaty nerd lifestyle
[5:09:53] exilethegamer: WoW on gamepass though? that's possible
[5:09:55] SethLan: i dont have a console
[5:09:59] Siddie: towCopium towCopium
[5:10:02] Sleepylol93: Remember the plebs who used to get mad on hardcore and they had 0 Keybinds LUL LUL
[5:10:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Microsoft will probably press them to get it on console, I think
[5:10:03] Scraggersmeh: @Cakeabsorber FF can do console because FF as a game has very little difficulty, and no addons allowed.
[5:10:05] procyon_mfc: who's twitter was that? @Towelliee
[5:10:05] PrimalRain: it'll come up again when there's another pruning
[5:10:06] Manabucho: lets get to the real spice @Towelliee wow on mobile
[5:10:08] FrankieSmiles: theres no reason for them not to put it on game pass
[5:10:12] Nimz83: Or end up as a part of gamepass, lol
[5:10:12] innuend0o: some games just don't need to be on console
[5:10:12] BafflingRainbow: ff14 hates addons and wow embraced them... two different birds
[5:10:15] InDoddWeTrust: i don't think it'll be on xbox but it could go on PC gamepass.
[5:10:19] grannynonny: I also don't have a console LUL
[5:10:20] im_capy: D4 adding to it as well
[5:10:26] TheZander: please god no wow in console, the game would have to be simplified so so much in terms of abilities you have alone
[5:10:26] IchabodCrain: ff may be on console, but there are some functions that you still need a mouse and keyboard for
[5:10:29] danielthegathering: why would you want housing if you have no friends to come to your house?
[5:10:31] Aquadriel: Cakeabsorber ff was built with console in mind from the begining. WoW was built for pc and has been all this time. Not saying it cant happen but... it might be rough
[5:10:33] raukase: the engine is so old there is no way theyll take the effort of adapting it to consoles
[5:10:33] Thunder4o: People must be crazy to think they can play PvP on console...PvP players got like 50-60 or even more keybinds and positioning and movement in arena is even more important
[5:10:42] looney199725: no one will play wow with console players
[5:10:42] botscast: did someone say HOUSING??
[5:10:43] Cakeabsorber: @Aquadriel aha
[5:10:44] Ezekyler: housing is sowhere hide in the spaghetti code i swear towTinfoil
[5:10:45] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @Towelliee Yeah let WoW go to console but just keep there without cross platform lol
[5:10:45] han_saro: I don't think they would be able to bring it to console so long as they let addons steer the way they design raid encounters in any way. Console players wouldn't have addons and therefore would be at a disadvantage.
[5:10:46] restokin: 4 player WoW on the Nintendo 64
[5:10:46] TheCliffyShow: So, your saying housing is coming?
[5:10:50] EpicJune: Housing will come PepeHands
[5:10:50] Velashen: Housing next expansion. Console never. Quote me on it Kappa
[5:10:57] Nimz83: @InDoddWeTrust We'd all sign up for gamepass, I think it's cheaper than the sub or at least the same price and you get access to other games
[5:10:58] darbuthetank: Wow has too many button left to go on console
[5:11:11] warrenny: Thats a decent burger üòÇ
[5:11:12] Menion01: You already have housing. It‚Äôs called a Garrison.
[5:11:21] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @Towelliee Yeah let WoW go to console but just keep there without cross platform lol
[5:11:26] InDoddWeTrust: @Nimz83 exactly.  it'd be awesome.
[5:11:28] boomerhands80: ohhh, dungeons are out?
[5:11:31] Velashen: @menion01 wrong.
[5:11:31] looney199725: theres classes with to many buttons
[5:11:32] Sleepylol93: Would be awesome
[5:11:32] gritbarontv: FF has the same amount of buttons too, so it's not a surprise if it does, not that care about it, but be real
[5:11:33] looney199725: for console
[5:11:37] eeriEntertainment: Is this a heroic? Or normal
[5:11:47] Cakeabsorber: yeah make it a part of the game PogChamp
[5:11:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: just make warcraft 4 and release on console as well
[5:12:01] looney199725: why do ppl want wow on console
[5:12:05] looney199725: it would be crap
[5:12:08] grannynonny: Warcraft 4 would be great!
[5:12:12] mavericks312: @gritbarontv addons alone will prevent it from releasing on console cause player would be ignored if they didnt have addons
[5:12:13] kpo887: wow would be better if addons never existed - change my mind
[5:12:15] RealBrickTamland: Hey any thoughts on Prot Warrior so far in Alpha?
[5:12:21] Frank4LuLz: green for dragons, like they couldn't come up with another identifying color
[5:12:22] 2MakeMe: mage colors
[5:12:26] Holyryze: @Towelliee looks like blood dk tree had the shadowlands DRW leggo on it...so can we expect DRW high uptime like on retail currently??
[5:12:48] Thiefrider: @towelliee if you drink it again then you get a 1hour time on the flask
[5:13:01] ditaern: @looney199725 Because I can play ESO and FFXIV comfortably on console. I want to be able to play WoW as well.
[5:13:01] gritbarontv: maybe
[5:13:13] looney199725: eso and ffxiv
[5:13:18] looney199725: were designed with console in mind
[5:13:19] looney199725: wow wasnt
[5:13:27] csd_fustian: this fire eles look amazing
[5:13:38] looney199725: eso and ffxiv are alot easier than wow also
[5:13:45] grannynonny: I think casual content could be done but not raiding..
[5:13:45] looney199725: you think you gonna raid mythic on a console?
[5:13:48] mavericks312: @ditaern even if it did release on console do you excect to be invited to things
[5:14:15] Frank4LuLz: dragons aren't to  squishy
[5:14:22] im_capy: wow has a very fast response time for character movement vs games like FF, its why it is night and day for most MMOs being compared to wow, even by todays standards
[5:14:43] Phoenixfiend: you can literally play WoW right now on your phone using STEAM LINK
[5:14:50] looney199725: ffxiv combat is so slow im shocked ppl can even get hit by mechanics
[5:14:54] propwash80: @towelliee from what you've tried how does the bdk feel? have you tried different builds?
[5:14:59] sir_skaeg: @Towelliee is it the ingame music or do u have something running in the background? cause theres some serious MoP vibes going on
[5:15:00] looney199725: every mechanic is highlighted for you in eso and ffxiv
[5:15:08] BelllGoR: @Phoenixfiend stream a key rn
[5:15:27] Hazno: @sir_skaeg I don't think they've added music in the new zones yet, it's his own WoW OST playlist
[5:15:28] ditaern: @looney199725 Not past normal in FFXIV
[5:15:31] hasan666: @looney199725 Yes because the movement is slow too
[5:15:35] mavericks312: @Phoenixfiend stream a +15 with the addons required to run it
[5:15:41] looney199725: exactly
[5:15:43] Valvax: the bottom action bar tile is not aligned with the first two and its triggering my OCD
[5:15:43] looney199725: wow is not slow
[5:15:48] rymerre: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:15:49] looney199725: so console wow makes 0 sense ever
[5:15:57] looney199725: would be a dumpster fire
[5:16:13] sir_skaeg: @Hazno its defo a banger, i absolutely loved MoP
[5:16:13] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:16:32] Phoenixfiend: @mavericks312 I didn't say it was a good idea but you can do it.. you can play on your phone and go collect herbs and mine nodes
[5:16:41] Hazno: I assume they'll add snapping to the action bars to ensure they're properly aligned, to match the behavior of action bar addons
[5:16:44] Rabiahtaro132: Its a learning process
[5:16:47] looney199725: thats not playing the game fully tho
[5:16:51] looney199725: if all you can do is farm ore
[5:16:52] warrenny: Triple evoker?
[5:16:53] looney199725: and do quests
[5:16:53] shagbark_: just push random buttons, isnt that how you play every spec in this game? Kappa
[5:16:56] hasan666: @looney199725 what do you mean? WoW is already a dumpster fire. Blizzard will do anything to make money
[5:16:59] looney199725: your doing 5% ofwow
[5:17:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: can we just drop it
[5:17:13] looney199725: going to console wont make more money haha
[5:17:17] looney199725: it will lose more ppl
[5:17:22] grannynonny: I wouldn't mind casual stuff like pet battles, fishing, etc. on mobile even. Be kind of neat.
[5:17:48] looney199725: wow is not made with console in mind if it was they would have done it already
[5:17:52] Frank4LuLz: AH on mobile was my toilet time
[5:17:56] Amarlian: How about that evoker healing, it seems like they need a bit more range to help it out a bit more
[5:18:04] grannynonny: @frank4lulz Exactly! LUL
[5:18:07] 91Niki: Alright guys, drops that wow on console discussion, or take it to dms
[5:18:19] hasan666: @looney199725 ah..i can't follow your logic anymore
[5:18:22] 91Niki: Y'all agree to disagree
[5:18:34] Frank4LuLz: its just banter
[5:18:40] dkenjoyer: can't wait for the other dungeons
[5:19:05] looney199725: do you think there holding raid testing for beta?
[5:19:06] Archiee: such an elitist, knowing mechanics and stuff LUL lol
[5:19:23] Rabiahtaro132: What do you think next classes are?
[5:19:24] DJ_PWNZ: are you gonna do any WOTLK raid testing today?
[5:19:30] danielthegathering: testin the game before its out, how elite
[5:19:31] un_original: the last class that gets their will be so scuffed on release
[5:19:42] looney199725: dh will prob be last
[5:19:43] looney199725: and be broken
[5:19:44] ssjshoutya: @Towelliee just watched the profession video pretty cool system :D
[5:19:47] csd_fustian: shit yeah i would do mission table, fishing, AH, etc. on mobile
[5:19:50] warrenny: Will they disable azure span then?
[5:19:51] un_original: talents*
[5:19:53] cabalish: that is a lightshow
[5:20:09] Rabiahtaro132: azure span is already disabled.
[5:20:21] Frank4LuLz: WOD was so good, the mobile app was the best during work
[5:20:34] danielthegathering: When are Giants a playable race?
[5:20:43] warrenny: @rabiahtaro132 Whats the current zone?

[5:21:03] danielthegathering: You can do that even when the vendor is there
[5:21:05] Aquadriel: Agree, but increase the material drop rate from nodes, otherwise will take too long
[5:21:10] Rabiahtaro132: @warrenny Evoker starting zone.
[5:21:17] Frank4LuLz: i still want Nagga as a playable race and pally Gnomes
[5:21:20] dkenjoyer: 9 patches? PogChamp
[5:21:24] Wolfenhoof: I hope the fucking goldmakers don't exploit the shit out of every system again so that it's castrated to death at release like in SL.
[5:21:32] warrenny: @rabiahtaro132 Ah my bad
[5:21:36] InDoddWeTrust: i wanted a mail tank PepeHands
[5:21:48] Animemron: Ogres for next playable race "hopium"
[5:21:48] Rabiahtaro132: all good, that's why we ask questions.
[5:21:51] danielthegathering: Luxthos is online
[5:21:56] warrenny: @indoddwetrust Evoker potential üòì
[5:22:03] un_original: remember when people were pissed about losing "progress" on the beta ? LULW
[5:22:04] GamingDad77: tbh... that's how it should be
[5:22:04] ashnmsr: Where is dragon knight!
[5:22:15] Frank4LuLz: or Shammie Gnomes
[5:22:21] ditaern: @ashnmsr Dota 2
[5:22:22] looney199725: DF gonna be so great will be first expac that you struggle to find dps other than evoker lmao
[5:22:24] InDoddWeTrust: @warrenny ikr.  dragon tank would be amazing FeelsBadMan
[5:22:25] Nimz83: So Post Malone was doing a charity stream last night and I'm pretty sure he had a life-sized Kratos statue holding a baby Groot, lol
[5:22:40] warrenny: @indoddwetrust Itd be badass
[5:22:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Professions are BACK - Specialization Talent Trees in Dragonflight youtu.be/Hd8Eg7q0bcs
[5:22:43] ashnmsr: @ashnmsr We could easily have the dragon knight as the 3rd spec!
[5:23:00] Nimz83: They are going to be a Captcha
[5:23:06] Amarlian: @looney199725 that happens most of the expansions with new classes so nothing new
[5:23:07] pavepawns: limit work orders to 10 each hour?
[5:23:07] Frank4LuLz: bots... damn you are right...5head
[5:23:08] Youredoneson666: I thought they said there would be a cooldown on them
[5:23:11] Nimz83: Where we have to pick out all the traffic lights
[5:23:12] RavageTV_: Reagents will be sold region wide, wont bots fill up low pop servers and own the market?
[5:23:14] Youredoneson666: like maybe 5 a day or something
[5:23:17] dracullus: mats should be cheap, we will all be on one megaserver for this part of AH
[5:23:17] InDoddWeTrust: I thought I heard there was a cooldown on filling them but not sure.
[5:23:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: daily limit to complete an order imo to encourage people to tip well for the service to get there item made
[5:23:21] Bayne77: or check the box, i am not a robot
[5:23:21] Solomonlike: Limit? Oh no
[5:23:30] sliproach: @Nimz83 please select all the dragon pictures
[5:23:31] Gutroan: or a captcha, click the traffic lights!
[5:23:34] Amarlian: and who cares, let people play what they want to play. it's not a job @looney199725
[5:23:36] Frank4LuLz: fuck  bots still incoming as usual
[5:23:45] mofoloco1: yeah bud their is a bot problem with every game thatcomes out right now its pretty inevitable that bots are gonna ruin a part of dragonflight
[5:23:55] shagbark_: Do you think tons of players will main evoker or that it will balance out? @Towelliee
[5:23:55] Angeius90: Hey Towelliee!! you've tried warrior yet?  haven't been able to find warrior talent trees anywhere :(
[5:23:59] PrimalRain: gotta click all the trams
[5:23:59] Rabiahtaro132: If they limit it though, the easier and smaller orders have a lower chance of being produced.
[5:24:04] Architank: In game Kaptcha would be hilarious
[5:24:04] Dieelon: Captcha is the new M+ mechanic
[5:24:05] Mecabeast: everywork order popular box requires you to type notarobot
[5:24:06] Dankind64: OMEGALUL that would be perfect
[5:24:14] mavericks312: please click on all the zepplins
[5:24:18] Gotxiko: there is a type of captcha where you do nothing, it just analyzes your mouse input anc check if the input is "natural"
[5:24:19] Phatori: "click all the images that have daddy denathrius to prove youre not a robot"
[5:24:22] Mecabeast: popup*
[5:24:29] Clucky2988: @shagbark_ Probs at the start they will be so popular but will die out and normalize
[5:24:35] Architank: Click on all pictures that don't contain a dirty horde/alliance player
[5:24:36] Frank4LuLz: evoker the the Dh , millions will be quaesting along side
[5:24:54] Frank4LuLz: new*
[5:25:04] Kosen_: I don't want a per character cooldown for it, but I'd be fine w/ a max at once limit e.g. 5 work orders at once
[5:25:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: make a crafting alt named Notabot so people get items crafted by Notabot
[5:25:10] abracka_: @Frank4LuLz astute observation
[5:25:22] Solomonlike: I wonder if they‚Äôre going to control the price then to. Eventually demand will outpace supply and drive the price up
[5:25:29] Architank: If they wanted to they could always flag accounts that fulfill an unnatural number of work orders then have a GM investigate them.
[5:25:38] looney199725: bdk always gargo first season of expac
[5:25:48] Frank4LuLz: @abracka_  ty kind ser
[5:25:55] lithium364: brd :lul 5 hour timer

[5:26:07] Frank4LuLz: love the purps drop
[5:26:14] Bayne77: WC+15
[5:26:23] Artiiz: How are DKs right now compared to SL?
[5:26:30] Milanesa_De_Pollo: M+ Occulus PogChamp
[5:26:47] Artiiz: Do they have any different playstyle or pretty much just the same?
[5:27:06] Aquadriel: NF players in shambles when they realize they losing pot tender on prepatch
[5:27:08] looney199725: there will always be a meta playstyle for content

[5:28:19] smol_gunner: losing Soulshape sucks so bad
[5:28:25] wastedxtime93: I was honestly very suprised to see they didn't add wild spirits to the hunters kit

[5:28:27] Aquadriel: pot tender, flesh craft and soul shape gonna hurt
[5:28:28] CommanderKrano: so, are the Covenant skills completely gone or do they just only work int he SL then?
[5:28:29] MOXP: YEP like legion relics :(
[5:28:30] Menion01: You mean like dragon flying?
[5:28:39] Artiiz: @CommanderKrano Some have been added into talent trees
[5:28:41] looney199725: im glad pod tender is gone
[5:28:49] looney199725: sick of bad players being saved by it
[5:28:58] Hazno: @CommanderKrano they are still in Shadowlands
[5:29:04] Solomonlike: I want to return to Wow but trying to play catch-up and raider I/O and getting into Mythics is going to be a headache
[5:29:05] CommanderKrano: ok, ty
[5:29:08] IchabodCrain: @CommanderKrano they are adding some of them to the talent tree, but not all of them
[5:29:08] BoezIRL: you mean like every piece of gear thath you get?
[5:29:10] looney199725: people to happy to die cuz they know pod is there
[5:29:12] mavericks312: i really hope dragonriding becomes the norm in the future for early flyingesque
[5:29:14] Metalcalfe: I hope they just open it up everywhere eventually
[5:29:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Podtender is bullshit, it needs to be gone....seen it win too many PvP matches
[5:29:18] Vendralos: I want Dragonriding for all the old zones
[5:29:25] Kosen_: Even if it doesn't get updated, having the zones built with it in mind would definitely be amazing
[5:29:26] PvtHudson093: losing all my Azerite powers and essences sucked
[5:29:53] Tizbit: create new types of riding for diff mounts
[5:29:55] 91Niki: That's a lot of work with old mount models, in terms of reanimating them
[5:29:59] Valvax: that would literally cost a raid tier no meme
[5:29:59] Dadinyo: i m playing 15 years wow,but in think is the 1 extasion whoo im not played more!! dragon fly just disgusting mee
[5:29:59] Hazno: what do you mean I can't dragonride with Invincible :)
[5:30:01] wastedxtime93: Someone come hit me with their cat and put me in a temp coma till DF releases pls
[5:30:07] wastedxtime93: car*
[5:30:08] looney199725: i was thinking the same @Towelliee i think they will just add ontop of dragon riding
[5:30:09] Rabiahtaro132: Let the special mounts have the special thing. Like when the waterstriders could waterwalk.
[5:30:12] sliproach: dragon riding on elogon my poor eyes
[5:30:15] Vendralos: yes please
[5:30:16] grannynonny: That would be fun!
[5:30:27] Frank4LuLz: 1000 needs sadge
[5:30:35] PokerFaceMoose: a lot of maps are not really made for dragon riding.
[5:30:41] Mecabeast: I saw a pretty good soar clip in revendreth
[5:30:45] Lanis_aa: The Barrens Grand Prix
[5:30:48] backstreetalright: Cool idea
[5:30:49] TweektheProphet: wowhead just put out Plate PVP armour
[5:30:49] warrenny: One in dragonblight
[5:30:52] 91Niki: @PokerFaceMoose That too
[5:31:12] looney199725: they could start designed future maps with dragon riding in mind now
[5:31:13] mavericks312: most of azeroth doesnt have the zones for dragon riding
[5:31:35] Dankind64: monkaS
[5:31:38] icerasta: @tano_cosplay That was yesterday
[5:31:39] ashnmsr: What if hear me out! What if next expansion they do another catacalysm like expansion and make azeroth like df zones for flying!
[5:32:00] looney199725: next expac is likely gonna be the light vs void war
[5:32:08] looney199725: since nzoth whispers have come true
[5:32:10] Thagoris: Thagoris subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 67 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Happy Thursday!
[5:32:12] BoezIRL: they would need to rework almost all of azeroth
[5:32:14] CommanderKrano: cataclsym 2.0 PogChamp
[5:32:17] ashnmsr: @looney199725 I think it's gonna be legion + sargares
[5:32:31] Architank: @ashnmsr next next expansion is just Cata with Galakrond
[5:32:32] looney199725: a 3rd legion i dont think so
[5:32:32] ashnmsr: @BoezIRL yes but the new 100+ people adding to wow?
[5:32:33] SethLan: how about ground mount... BGS that you can just throw something of your mount and knock that player of the mount :)
[5:32:37] looney199725: sargeres will come back sure
[5:32:45] looney199725: but i dont think he will bring legion
[5:32:46] nesman27: hogger world boss world quest Pog
[5:32:50] luckfore: tentacle mammoth WutFace
[5:32:52] ancientxan: Even if they do a Cata rework I'd be happy with one or part of one continent. Take Arathi and above for instance in EK
[5:32:53] ArcaneMaki: Re-doing old zone is a lot of work (from a World Designer game dev)
[5:32:54] xch4se: xch4se subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[5:32:55] ashnmsr: next expansion is about legion i'm 100% sure it's been long
[5:32:57] DeanoTV: legion raids are doable right?
[5:32:58] Solomonlike: Why do the still have so much gatekeeping in old stuff then lol?
[5:32:59] mavericks312: xpac after DF is most likely void vs light or atleast the start of it
[5:33:00] Twankiez1992: this elephant looks sick
[5:33:05] exilethegamer: Legion in my opinion did WQ the best and it sucks that they went backwards in favor of dailies. Bringing WQ to every zone would be a great experience without updating the zones themselves
[5:33:05] Kosen_: @BoezIRL They should just add old monsters to new zones and then update them in small parts
[5:33:08] looney199725: why do you want a 3rd legion expac?
[5:33:11] Frank4LuLz: mog item
[5:33:13] Hazno: please no more legion, I've had enough green fel shit for another 10 years minimum
[5:33:15] looney199725: people would be so mad at blizz
[5:33:17] Frank4LuLz: mount
[5:33:19] looney199725: for a 3rd legion expac
[5:33:21] 91Niki: Grey item rewards from hogger Kappa
[5:33:24] ashnmsr: @looney199725 It's not about wanting it , it's about the lore
[5:33:28] Artiiz: How much HP do players have at 70?
[5:33:31] Purging: @Towelliee as of right now, how many bars total can you have with default blizz UI? im wondering if id be able to switch from bartender with 10 total bars to default UI
[5:33:32] looney199725: lore wise
[5:33:33] OviTheGray: need to rewind time for Hogger wb... he dead :(
[5:33:36] looney199725: does it make sense#?
[5:33:39] CommanderKrano: i heard we can do the legion raids solo on mythic with DF. cant wait to farm those mythic sets
[5:33:41] ashnmsr: They said legion will be back when legion ended , and we don't know anything about the sword and sargeras
[5:33:42] looney199725: why would the legion be back a 3rd time?
[5:33:48] SethLan: old zones needs to be re-visit - as they r ghost towns
[5:33:48] Aquadriel: imagine riding hogger Gayge
[5:33:53] Nowaayjose: Whoever thinks legion was good for it‚Äôs artifact shit has no worthy opinion in my eyes
[5:34:03] SethLan: A Ship that can carry up to 100 people
[5:34:03] Purging: gotcha, thank you!
[5:34:08] mavericks312: @CommanderKrano becasue at that point we just over level it not due to legacy dmg though lol
[5:34:09] ashnmsr: Because emm like legion is a big part of warcraft?
[5:34:10] Solomonlike: I quit bc the want you in the current xpack but gatekeeps so much of the old stuff
[5:34:11] Thagoris: Extra bag slot will be nice.  Helps my hoarder tendencies
[5:34:11] Gezber: so how's Blood DK?
[5:34:12] Artiiz: @Nowaayjose It was good, its the AP grind that was awful at the beginning until they made QoL changes to it
[5:34:12] jaacobjames: theres no shot people are out here using more than 5 bars, right?
[5:34:18] looney199725: id rather them do the story nzoth built with light vs void expac
[5:34:18] Frank4LuLz: need my bartender
[5:34:26] 91Niki: @Nowaayjose Good thing it's only your opinions then ;)
[5:34:31] norunkai1989: @looney199725 cause sargeras is still alive ?
[5:34:33] Purging: i currently have around 90 bindings on my main so im not sure id be able to swap to default
[5:34:35] Shattermare: You could
[5:34:36] SethLan: lol
[5:34:37] Cakeabsorber: LMAO
[5:34:40] CommanderKrano: @mavericks312 well, true. yeah :( i stopped in SL because that wasnt in there and farming old raids was one of my main doings in WoW
[5:34:43] Zyricks: Ther is only 1 true Goldshire lol
[5:34:44] Nimz83: That's what RP servers are for
[5:34:46] Frank4LuLz: red ridge is og GANK FEST
[5:34:48] rudericus: RPers do I suppose
[5:34:49] Wolfenhoof: Thunderbluff is still the most beautiful town ever made. I mean its full of tauren!
[5:34:53] SethLan: I wanna hang out in barrens, and drink beer with my buddy
[5:34:56] tryune01: yeah who wants the world, in world if warcraft
[5:34:59] sugekite: redridge is kinda fire tho
[5:34:59] looney199725: @norunkai1989 it was also shown he was a pawn of the jailer
[5:35:00] OviTheGray: maybe we get Gilneas back :)
[5:35:00] wetttnine: Lmao
[5:35:05] ArcaneMaki: Legion was excellent.
[5:35:05] Rabbi19: The only way to make that happen would be player housing.
[5:35:24] mavericks312: @CommanderKrano i try to farm the hounds in antoras on all 3 levels but taht shit is rough on mythic
[5:35:27] SpookBoio: @Wolfenhoof biggest true ever true'd
[5:35:37] XanaGear: world is so big they could do player housing without instances
[5:35:45] zelda4tw: any idea when beta is coming?
[5:35:49] looney199725: if next expac is a 3rd legion expac alot of people will quit because they will say blizz is washed up
[5:35:53] CommanderKrano: @mavericks312 yeeeeeah. i tried sageras alone at the start of SL. No really chance on mythic sadly :(
[5:35:53] Hu33ard: @Rabbi19 wouldn't this have the opposite effect
[5:35:56] shrektard69: where is baldy at?
[5:35:59] dkenjoyer: this dungeon looks so good
[5:36:09] sliproach: player housing but most of the npcs don't have homes yet
[5:36:33] DizzyJVD: sweet looking instance
[5:36:33] violentmeme: I guess a lot of the interesting mechanics/challenge comes in with mythic difficulty
[5:36:37] SethLan: I wanna buy new door for my housing
[5:36:39] mavericks312: we need to fix the npc homeless problem before we add player housing lol
[5:36:42] ArcaneMaki: Keep the players together where they can.
[5:36:43] sorshanova: some content would be cool
[5:36:52] sorshanova: adding old things into the game would be cool
[5:36:56] MR_WYTE: Heh... he said "boner"
[5:36:57] Fugazi811: no chance they ever revamp the old zones
[5:37:01] shrektard69: ungoro is cool
[5:37:02] luckfore: legion style prepatch
[5:37:07] looney199725: the way the intro made DF sound azeroth will be born by end of this expac
[5:37:07] Mister_Ript: Garrisons were a huge missed opportunity for Guild Halls.
[5:37:08] therad1calbrad1cal: that would be DOPE. pvp in old zones would be amazing
[5:37:08] ancientxan: Settle down Beavis
[5:37:09] Milanesa_De_Pollo: leaked?
[5:37:11] looney199725: maybe as a titan
[5:37:15] warrenny: People bitch when they use old world stuff tho
[5:37:19] Solomonlike: I‚Äôd rather they lift all the gatekeeping in the old stuff
[5:37:23] SethLan: Bar in Xroads
[5:37:38] Frank4LuLz: we need more time travel and multi-verses

[6:06:09] elkevo20: @NovaHeadTurner Try installing on a different drive?
[6:06:13] Kasvot_Vaxt: do you think there is potential for build variability at a high level or will everyone just use the same thing
[6:06:29] Hazno: core tree feels kinda meh for enhancement imo, but enhancement tree feels good, so many good choices

[6:10:18] 91Niki: @NovaHeadTurner When reinstalling windows did you nuke it and installed windows via bios, or did you reinstall via the media tool? Cuz if you use the media tool, odds are some files might still hang around and fuck shit up

[6:11:10] kirbygageofficial: that needs 3 keyboards
[6:11:14] Novaht: @91Niki I did a full fresh install i went deep down to software stuff
[6:11:15] MirroredZephyr: Thunderous Paws - spirit wolf is pretty meh
[6:11:16] ArcaneSyntax: spirit wolf is bad

[6:13:46] Aquadriel: the left side with primordial wave is pretty nutty if you take lavalash spread
[6:13:50] ParfumAmerican: are u lvl high enaugf?
[6:14:01] garbagaha: Can you play 2H shaman in dragonflight

[6:14:14] FostBros: windfury in middle
[6:14:15] 91Niki: @NovaHeadTurner You got any issues installing any other games on your rig? Like via steam or other stuff?

[6:17:11] infinityarty: witch docters into alpha
[6:17:13] supernohva_xt: grab Doomwinds
[6:17:18] Cyony: you only need 1 point in the 2 passives besides witch doctors

[6:17:38] Zavier420: @Towelliee Are class tier sets in DF?
[6:17:41] MirroredZephyr: gust of wind fills that niche now and doesn't require a target
[6:17:42] tornbraclet: you forgot doom winds
[6:17:49] TheZander: wave is pure aoe
[6:17:54] JellyBeansEU: you are missing frost shock build it's best aoe spec for enhance on right side

[6:19:04] Grimmerino90: I think alpha wolf doesn't work atm on alpha
[6:19:05] 91Niki: @NovaHeadTurner Yeah then you gotta wait for them to reply to your ticket
[6:19:10] infinityarty: @Yinng_K you get 5 more points in each tree
[6:19:22] ArcaneSyntax: @buttnarcknosis i mean, he doesn't play shaman regularly
[6:19:26] Inthezonewow: Same message twice LUL
[6:19:32] Cyony: I would not be suprised if a shaman has 3 times as many buttons as a demon hunter
[6:19:42] techsn0w: @buttnarcknosis so funny seeing you type this twice to get a reaction LMAO
[6:19:47] Peoplewhinetoomuch: What does the wolf lunge look like?
[6:19:54] Hood______: imagine calling Towelliee a noob lmao
[6:19:54] kranztheman: @buttnarcknosis you're a special kind of stupid aren't you?

[6:20:14] wreckshoptv: charge in wolf form
[6:20:16] Mitune: I think its on live @Peoplewhinetoomuch its pvp talent I think
[6:20:16] ArcaneSyntax: yeah it's a charge
[6:20:16] Torkelnder: like cat jump
[6:20:18] Thoreya: lolololol
[6:20:19] nesman27: people gonna be plugging in a MIDI piano to play shaman lol

[6:20:45] Cyony: any theorycrafters in chat. Is it actually worth it taking windfury totem if you are the only melee in your team? I feel like it's an ability you can actually skip taking.
[6:20:45] Nachozdood: thats why you have Ahnk
[6:20:57] willie_zenn: I don't even play DK but I'm excited to see it

[6:21:24] tornbraclet: you have 4 main totems you use all the time
[6:21:25] 91Niki: @NovaHeadTurner Hmm that's an odd one. It sounds like there is a conflict with the files. Not sure what's causing it tho.
[6:21:38] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee We need will of the elements or whatever its called, where you choose which 4 you drop and you just drop them with 1 spell
[6:21:38] ArcaneSyntax: @Cyony probably not, enhance doesn't get that much benefit from it
[6:21:43] falldrgn: @Cyony its always worth it.. it buffs your damage.. not sure if it affects pets or not
[6:21:43] strchsr: @Towelliee Just rebind WASD and move solely with your mouse
[6:21:47] vathus_: Will you also try a full single target Ascendance build??
[6:21:51] cbates30: how lava burst work with enhance shaman

[6:22:20] Shattermare: Will Evoker be OP in WOTLK Classic?
[6:22:21] dewking93: all totem lives matter
[6:22:25] 91Niki: @NovaHeadTurner Have you tried verifying files? If you even can do that if it's stuck installing lol
[6:22:33] Gezber: POGGERS
[6:22:34] donzy986: Should go back to the older days where you can drop 4 totems at once
[6:22:34] Architank: All totems matter but some matter more than others..
[6:22:37] falldrgn: @Shattermare Evoker will not be in WOTLK classic
[6:22:37] geokouts: ez dodged!
[6:22:38] braddeus: @Cyony i'll prob set up a selfish loadout and a support loadout  with windury, tremor, etc.
[6:22:41] Dankind64: yeyeee
[6:22:42] Kisswani: checking towCopium
[6:22:44] ArcaneSyntax: like any DW class doesn't get much from wft, and neither does enhance.
[6:22:47] Urebaldd: Don't give me false hope
[6:22:52] sliproach: @NovaHeadTurner whats the issue buddy?
[6:22:54] geokouts: checked, nothing

[6:23:17] PotbellyGoat: Immortal had bad DCs all last night
[6:23:17] luckfore: probably mrgm breaking the game
[6:23:19] Cyony: @falldrgn sure, it's always a positive, but is it more impactfull then any other good talent? Thats the choice now. Like, would you rather have 5% elemental damage or windfury totem?  for purely self benefit, it might be the worst talent in the tree is what i'm asking
[6:23:21] falldrgn: not even WOTLK beta invite :/
[6:23:24] Rob3phones: nothing in my Bnet FeelsBadMan
[6:23:30] The_Tacozilla: these DCs are getting annoying, happening to me too
[6:23:37] Urebaldd: I'm honestly not bothered right now, just waiting for beta, lets the experts test alpha

[6:59:20] Flonde33: fire ele is in the ele tree
[6:59:26] Aro725: even in wotlk it just worked on your current firetotem that was out

[7:00:44] SLoPPYALieN: ghost wolf can get you back in quickly
[7:00:45] Dratomae: You don't have a filler really
[7:00:47] tastytictacs: usually you have frost shock as a filler @Towelliee
[7:00:48] ParfumAmerican: usualy stormstrike
[7:00:49] TheZander: you dont have one, you press whats up in a priority order
[7:00:50] Aro725: you dont have one, everything has a cd
[7:00:50] Dratomae: You spam everything
[7:00:53] XshadowturkeyX: you spam stormstrike
[7:00:59] Aro725: just press what lights up
[7:01:03] ArcaneSyntax: You have a priority list
[7:01:04] ParfumAmerican: filler with frost shok
[7:01:05] schro0d: Melee (windfury proc) is the filler tbh
[7:01:06] SethLan: 1 2 3  3 2 1
[7:01:10] dantezalive: enh just presses whatever is up lol
[7:01:15] Tocrac: is there no weapon imbue spells?
[7:01:15] Tkfoxy: Tkfoxy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[7:01:17] infinityarty: @Aquadriel true, but it isnt in the talent tree is it?
[7:01:20] TheZander: determined by the proccs (stormstrike reset/hothand)
[7:01:20] ArcaneSyntax: and the lower prio stuff is the filler when you can't hit anything else
[7:01:26] Aquadriel: Your filler in SL is frostshock, but not sure if is needed now
[7:01:28] Rayao: remember flame shock on trash too :)
[7:01:31] Crazy__Alex: Got Money on my Mind
[7:01:38] ArcaneSyntax: like frost shock and crash in ST are filler spells
[7:01:39] MaivGG: is he listening warcraft music all day or is just the music only for the stream?
[7:01:40] Aquadriel: infinityarty is in the CLASS tree, yes

[7:02:39] Aquadriel: np infinityarty
[7:02:41] ArcaneSyntax: I can't wait for towelliee to try primordial wave build, it's HUGE BRAIN
[7:02:51] Titannborn: Yes dude
[7:02:56] SylvanTerror: nova makes it easy to remember flameshock
[7:03:02] tastytictacs: enh is a really different melee spec.. definitely my go to despite being bad 90% of the time
[7:03:17] Titannborn: I always use flame shock first attack to ensure it‚Äôs upm
[7:03:23] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee you really want the cap talents behind primordial wave
[7:03:41] ArcaneSyntax: if you got that build
[7:03:43] bananaamontana: Dude 10 ads
[7:03:51] Pexaan: man I haven't played wow in a long time, I miss elemental shaman so damn much.
[7:03:55] edlest05: does lava lash not spread flame shock
[7:04:05] ArcaneSyntax: @edlest05 it does
[7:04:11] tastytictacs: alpha wolves seem like aoe, primo wave cap chain is cleave and the new ascendance stuff looks like awesome ST
[7:04:16] RiptoreCA: The flameshock chat troll is real
[7:04:23] Tocrac: winfury and flametounge weapon not a thing anymore??
[7:04:32] Gezber: they are
[7:04:34] ArcaneSyntax: @Tocrac they are
[7:04:40] wulftrn: yes
[7:04:44] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee it works with maelstrom weapon
[7:04:46] wulftrn: take it off you don't use it
[7:04:50] Stefan_x64: imagine if you could get an engineer to make a bomb to remove this rock instantly. Would be neat
[7:04:51] ArcaneSyntax: it just doesn't light up
[7:04:52] Gezber: top right action bars @Tocrac
[7:04:53] Tocrac: guess its not a buff anymore i take it
[7:04:56] tastytictacs: i hope they make lava burst work with maelstrom weapon
[7:04:56] mini2506: Have u tried it ?  Maybe its an UI bug ?
[7:05:07] smoke1x2knight: never got the leggo drop NotLikeThis
[7:05:12] Ezekyler: KEKW
[7:05:37] Tocrac: @Gezber oh ya im just a blind fuck
[7:05:40] Nauti_: I think Flametongue and WF weapon actually fell off maybe? They were showing earlier
[7:05:55] duhworks: the lil shaman that could
[7:05:56] frostzebra: odir
[7:05:58] Aquadriel: wind rush here
[7:05:58] Tocrac: @Nauti_ thats what i was thinking
[7:06:03] Nevindaz: towGift
[7:06:09] Nevindaz: c
[7:06:11] Gezber: @Tocrac no worries. it's kinda hard to find them

[7:07:35] Nevindaz: this will be so thought on m+
[7:07:41] 91Niki: @Felldoh_ Yeah you have a lot more options to customize UI in DF
[7:07:48] Mitune: Cough cough* Shaman tank with fire res totem as a choice cough* LUL
[7:07:51] Tocrac: hey @Towelliee make sure you have the winfury and flametounge weapon buff on XD
[7:07:52] Shrenko: hi towelliee how are the dungeons so far?
[7:08:02] zeitgeiz: Dps has to play so much around an Evoker healer
[7:08:10] professorjayctwin: They should just make Evokers 40 range.
[7:08:10] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[7:08:13] wulftrn: that's how
[7:08:13] Nowaayjose: Is fire resistance totem still a thing ?
[7:08:20] CrunkyBrewster: like ESO Dungeons. You gotta stick with the healer
[7:08:20] ArcaneSyntax: no
[7:08:21] Metalcalfe: Evoker should be using their insane mobility to keep in range
[7:08:30] professorjayctwin: Since when did Onyxia only have 25 yard range?
[7:08:31] Mitune: its not
[7:08:32] hirosan84: live enhas is no way as flashy as dragonflight
[7:08:34] ChrisStoll: Is Uldaman rough for a shaman healer?
[7:08:40] Nowaayjose: I was gonna say I thought they removed all the resist ones
[7:08:46] Gezber: @Felldoh_ i recommend watching a video on it. it has tons of options now. moving, resizing, spacing out the action bars
[7:08:47] ArcaneSyntax: @hirosan84 this is pretty similar
[7:08:47] Valyou3: When Zepla gets Alpha and you dont FeelsBadMan
[7:09:07] Shrenko: when do you think they will release the wotlk fresh servers?
[7:09:07] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |

[7:10:56] ArcaneSyntax: man crash lightning is so cool
[7:11:09] GamingDad77: really interested in this log result..
[7:11:25] byrom88: basically same as what they did with scarlet monostary
[7:11:30] noxryl: has anyone tested tip of the spear wig al
[7:11:31] Shrenko: @warrenny I want to lvl abit on tbc right now but all the gold buying and people having thousands of gold is putting me off
[7:11:31] Norbi33: it looks okey ish but will see what alse will come
[7:11:35] luckfore: the dungeon will be available in prepatch
[7:11:50] RadRage69: @byrom88 you realise that the gameplay you are seeing now is like you going to SL and making a lvl 50 character and doing normal dungeons .... he has no gear and no haste
[7:11:50] ArcaneSyntax: It needs like 1-2 less bosess tho
[7:12:04] noxryl: has anyone tested tip of the spear with mongoose bit?
[7:12:15] warrenny: @shrenko Plus boosting
[7:12:16] Chopsor: it doesnt matter anymore if i play Alliance or Horde for M+ and Raids right ?
[7:12:37] Shrenko: @warrenny oh yeah definetly
[7:12:41] warrenny: @chopsor Nop
[7:13:02] ArcaneSyntax: yeah looking at damage when half the new talents dont work is cringe imo
[7:13:03] pako_powr: this is different
[7:13:06] Chopsor: thats cool
[7:13:07] rudericus: even if dmg turns out to be bad, enhance still looks fun to play
[7:13:13] Bareno: @Chopsor only mythic raids to my knowledge it stills matter, as guilds aren't cross faction ATM
[7:13:25] GamingDad77: @rudericus i agree
[7:13:30] warrenny: @bareno Yet hopefully
[7:13:37] Chopsor: @Chopsor f Mythic raiding KEKW not doing that anymore im to old
[7:13:40] Nowaayjose: @byrom88 it‚Äôs alpha dude xD
[7:13:54] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee earth ele is a defensive, it gives you extra hp
[7:14:01] hestar: Do you enjoy playing as a Goblin?
[7:14:02] Mister_Ript: Oh look, a dragon with frontal cone ability and tail swipe, also leaving debris pools.  Never seen this before!
[7:14:20] Kneckt: @Mister_Ript welcome to dragons?
[7:14:23] pako_powr: wow how much health do people have now? 7K dmg is like nothing
[7:14:24] Aquadriel: domo winds
[7:14:34] warrenny: @mister_ript Being consistsnt isnt bad
[7:14:42] looney199725: bruh i swear people complain for sake of complaining if you dont like the game quit
[7:14:44] Aquadriel: fire is elemental spec
[7:14:45] OwndOwndOwnd: as ele
[7:14:45] tastytictacs: if you try putting a point into lightning bolt resets Stormstrike, it might feel much better, towelliee
[7:14:45] Mallaes: In WoD yeah

[7:15:04] BigJustin26: ya it was ele spec and it boosted spell power while it was up
[7:15:11] Suwah84: Only ele shaman
[7:15:15] Mister_Ript: Especially for a final boss of a dungeon.
[7:15:17] TheVigiliance: How is the ulduar dungeon? Only bad i have heard is the boss where everyone dies, and then the lenght of the dungeon

[7:16:47] Gezber: for a first shot, pretty damn good
[7:16:54] Mitune: btw Alpha Wolf is apparently broken on alpha @Towelliee
[7:17:09] Nowaayjose: @deanotv the wow community is filled with wanna be game devs who know nothing of the developers process yet have so much too say
[7:17:14] ashwing_: Wild spirits????
[7:17:17] Mister_Ript: @looney199725 Its okay to have reservations and gripes about something and still enjoy it.  You don't have to love 100% of everything to participate.
[7:17:33] AvrithSATX: Just got back, awesome to see you testing Shaman. Please tell me they aren't being broken/nerfed into the void at the start of an expansion yet again.

[7:22:30] ArcaneSyntax: it wasn't viable in tbc
[7:22:31] Rayao: and the arrow at crash lightning
[7:22:31] Elseworldz: Long enough that people should stop asking for it.
[7:22:31] Malkyr: Sulfuras
[7:22:31] gurkalicious: alpha wolves is broken
[7:22:33] Aquadriel: enhance 2hand was boring AF
[7:22:34] Grimmerino90: Two handed enhancement is a meme
[7:22:35] Reth_Alius: YO TOWELLIEE WYD
[7:22:36] dragore87: you can still equip 2h
[7:22:37] FostBros: i miss 2 hand shammy
[7:22:37] Riolu_x: @Towelliee take fire nova :) really fun talent for aoe
[7:22:39] Rob3phones: TBC it worked but was only really viable in Vanilla
[7:22:41] Coriollis: vrtune enh 2h video ptsd KEKW
[7:22:41] gurkalicious: and 2h enhance has always been a meme, never was better
[7:22:42] shakkyboye: yep ^^
[7:22:43] sshadeh: yes
[7:22:46] house573: UNBREAKABLE
[7:22:48] Titannborn: The last time you can do to handed enhancement was in burning crusades when shamans still use strength as the main stat
[7:22:48] Nachozdood: Enhance kids been crying about it ever since vanilla
[7:22:51] Wolfenhoof: Back when i could make my own ammo for my hunter BibleThump
[7:22:52] Calciyummm: 2h enh shammy in wrath is viable
[7:22:52] Dankind64: it was so sick in vanilla. i loved it
[7:22:53] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee windfury works better with dw
[7:22:54] shakkyboye: hand of rag + windfury one shots
[7:23:00] rudericus: sulfuras + windfury
[7:23:00] Tocrac: i miss tanking in vanilla with a shaman XD

[7:23:14] Rayao: any chance of a link to logs? :)
[7:23:14] Architank: Would you rather 2H Enhance or a Tanking Spec chat?
[7:23:21] ArcaneSyntax: 2h enhance was not viable in tbc
[7:23:31] wulftrn: tanking spex
[7:23:31] tastytictacs: id only want 2h enhancement so i stop having to loot 2 weapons every tier
[7:23:31] dragore87: monks can do 2h/dual. hunters want 2h wth is wrong with 2h enahnce
[7:23:35] house573: unbreakable killed it for everyone
[7:23:43] OwndOwndOwnd: primordial for dung
[7:23:47] Reth_Alius: Moo
[7:23:48] alatryste: alpha Wolfs
[7:23:53] Tocrac: ascendance
[7:23:57] Tocrac: for the luls
[7:24:06] Grimmerino90: To really make pwave work you need thee capstone trait and some practice
[7:24:16] ArcaneSyntax: @dragore87 itemization, laval lash
[7:24:16] Rayao: @Towelliee  any chance for a link to the logs? :)
[7:24:20] brawlcuttt: its just like SL, no ?
[7:24:20] gen0dk: Are you testing Frost DK in Dung BRO?
[7:24:23] LycanKain: necrolord ability from SL
[7:24:26] Towelliee: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Kt6rXzQf9dZV8A74/
[7:24:29] tastytictacs: wave is super fun when you shoot off 6 lightning bolts at once. i love it
[7:24:34] thenormalbeast: Why does mana still exist?
[7:24:39] alatryste: alpha wolf/legacy of the frost wich/wicht doctor Wolf bones currently doesnt work
[7:24:47] ArcaneSyntax: @thenormalbeast for utility spells
[7:24:58] squidderssquid: why would mana not exist lol
[7:24:59] dragore87: @dragore87 those are literally all things that can easily be changed
[7:25:30] Tocrac: do ascendance for the burst
[7:25:34] tastytictacs: hailstorm icestrike would do phat cleave for sure
[7:25:39] volkreig: Ascendance is good for a stormstrike build
[7:25:41] wulftrn: ascendance KEKW
[7:25:41] ArcaneSyntax: go fire nove and primordial wave
[7:25:42] squidderssquid: ascendance would be for single target and primordial wave for AoE
[7:25:54] watpuppy: Yeah a good healer will be oom upon a raid boss dying
[7:26:07] ArcaneSyntax: no, it's st
[7:26:18] ArcaneSyntax: you spread a bunch of flame shocks
[7:26:19] HighThereBud: Anyone remember those little drinks you can get from Fry's Electronics and they looked like health and mana pots?
[7:26:22] gurkalicious: 1 person but makes ur next LB shot each FS target
[7:26:25] squidderssquid: it hits all targets with flame shock
[7:26:27] tastytictacs: spread flameshock with lava lash, then primo wave, then super lightning bolt
[7:26:29] Rayao: every target with flame shock is hit by your next lightningbolt
[7:26:30] ArcaneSyntax: then lightning bolt every target with flame shock
[7:26:33] squidderssquid: spread flame shock, then use lightning bolt
[7:26:34] Gezber: lightning bolt instead of chain lightning > much more damage
[7:26:50] Kneckt: @hightherebud i got some mana ones off amazon years ago lol
[7:26:51] Mister_Ript: @watpuppy I mean, you get to a point in an expansion where you can't even go oom.
[7:27:00] Firepowatv: use it with overflowing maelstrom for big damage
[7:27:08] squidderssquid: yes
[7:27:09] brawlcuttt: did they change flame shock target cap or ?
[7:27:15] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee one of the talents later gives you a fat stack of haste per target hit by the lightning bolt
[7:27:18] tastytictacs: it's juiced dmg.. as long as you dont compare yourself to monk, survival hunters, or warlocks
[7:27:23] Aquadriel: @Towelliee Primordial, Lava Lash, Lightning bolt
[7:27:29] Riolu_x: PW  just do one fire shok on target and small buff for you LB
[7:27:31] HighThereBud: @Kneckt lmao hell yeah!!
[7:27:33] squidderssquid: yeah the haste talent is strong with fire nova on big pulls
[7:27:33] PlagueHit: ooof that music <3
[7:27:38] Daveybutter: grizzly hills vibes
[7:27:51] Aquadriel: @Towelliee No, primordial gives you 5 stacks for free
[7:27:56] pootsmcgee508: the talent under PWave makes the stacks more consistent
[7:28:01] Gezber: yea
[7:28:02] watpuppy: @Mister_Ript Yeah at the very end of an expansion if your entire raid is geared af and have bosses on farm.  If you are progressing in a raid, you should be going oom
[7:28:05] Aquadriel: yeah until next primordial
[7:28:17] sshadeh: the elementalist ascendancy build looks nice lol
[7:28:19] sshadeh: haste stacking
[7:28:33] ArcaneSyntax: Now imagine you have fire nova
[7:28:33] Riolu_x: yes but on all targets affected by fire shok
[7:28:40] Dolas08: PW is micro Lust with full pw branch every 45 sec
[7:28:49] Rayao: tbh, i feel like the good thing about primordial now is the haste from necro leggo, dunno how good it is on its own
[7:28:56] Aquadriel: Yes, An outlaw rogue KEKW

[7:29:11] Gezber: @Aquadriel KEKW
[7:29:17] squidderssquid: right side of enhance tree
[7:29:18] ArcaneSyntax: on live it's 10, it's bonkers, basically a bloodlust every pull
[7:29:19] Riolu_x: fire nova really cool :) don't know why you dont like it
[7:29:20] Aquadriel: Enh tree
[7:29:21] squidderssquid: choice node
[7:29:22] tastytictacs: choice node of fire nova/hailstorm
[7:29:22] gurkalicious: hailstorm talent node
[7:29:23] Gezber: left of WF totem @Towelliee
[7:29:26] Gezber: right*
[7:29:28] straightupphat: Ench tree right side
[7:29:43] Aquadriel: Sadly fire nova was not too good on SL, so will see how its tuning is
[7:29:48] icerasta: I think primodial wave will be the tech for burst target swapping witha 10 stack maestrom ele blast
[7:29:58] ArcaneSyntax: fire nova is great in 9.2
[7:30:00] Rayao: that makes your flame shocks immensely more important to keep up :D
[7:30:21] tastytictacs: it's super fun aoe
[7:30:31] Riolu_x: PW - LL - FN - LB
[7:30:35] Riolu_x: like that
[7:30:51] Elseworldz: @ArcaneSyntax Only if you don't have both a warlock and survival hunter in your group. They'll juice mobs before you can even get a 2nd fire nova off.
[7:31:00] squidderssquid: great on big pulls but terrible on small pulls or ST
[7:31:18] Rayao: fire nova is such a short CD, that shit is ready all the time :D
[7:31:22] tastytictacs: fire nova is blinding when you have 6 of em. i love it
[7:31:42] squidderssquid: also the CDR guy makes it better than it would otherwise be, and the haste buff is nerfed from the legendary which also makes it weaker in dragonflight, still worth taking in some situations though
[7:31:50] Exxcar: towHAMUP hey @Towelliee and chat!
[7:31:58] DHed91: haste
[7:31:59] whyabadi: Haste/Mastery
[7:32:02] Coriollis: massive haste proly
[7:32:03] JzeaDecimate: probably haste
[7:32:04] Gezber: haste was top in SL
[7:32:16] Riolu_x: fire nova doing good numbers on live, hope on beta it stays the same
[7:32:19] tastytictacs: haste/mast gonna be nutty
[7:32:19] Rayao: you might want a bunch of crit aswell, now without conduits
[7:32:19] y0rtek: you do use frost shock as filler when nothing else is up
[7:32:23] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee this is more or less how it plays now
[7:32:31] DHed91: enh feels terrible with low haste honestly
[7:32:51] LearnedSomething: towelie take my talent <3
[7:33:01] Mr_Hanny: Frost Shockis the filler
[7:33:03] warrenny: @dhed91 So do most specs tbf
[7:33:24] shakkyboye: GLORIA
[7:33:24] Kisswani: feral next ? Kappa

[7:33:56] noxryl: has anyone tested tip of the spear with mongoose bit?
[7:33:57] OwndOwndOwnd: surv hunter pls
[7:34:00] its_pepito: MMMMmm yeah Papi!!!
[7:34:00] rudericus: towelliee which are you having the most fun playing?
[7:34:06] Dimensionstv: Why are they even adding talent trees when you will essential get all nodes with the points?? Seems lazy to me.. you should be able to put points into any spec and that would leave 50+ nodes to change from. Every class/spec is going to play the same.
[7:34:07] Shattermare: Why not
[7:34:10] strchsr: @Towelliee And then have our talents lol
[7:34:14] Kisswani: danHmm i'm sure some degenerate is gonna try
[7:34:15] HeatherJC83: max lvl is 68 usbt ut

[7:34:26] Wolfenhoof: @jedicily The right thing. It was about time.
[7:34:27] Shattermare: You can get OP trinkets from Shadowlands and boost them to 306 in Oribos
[7:34:33] TheVigiliance: Only one way to find out i guess
