[1:56:57] ashara_matsui: the amount of healing required for this has been nerfed a little, I can't imagine doing it several ilvl lower AND while it was harder like Echo and Liquid
[1:57:00] RasnerG: Aaaand 2 death xD
[1:58:07] RasnerG: but yeah we banned dh pugs on dathea due to dashes xD
[1:58:17] ashara_matsui: yeah they killed it with average ilvl of like 482.5
[1:58:47] ashara_matsui: I don't know if it's better to release the super hard version that only a handful of guilds do and then slowly nerf 4-5 times, or introduce the "final" product at the start
[1:59:04] RasnerG: why not apply to echo some day
[1:59:11] RasnerG: im sure they will get you
[2:02:16] RasnerG: yeah it was due to the dh's dashing into party members with the thunder debuff
