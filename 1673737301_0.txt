[3:27:13] AgileBeast: no it has passive
[3:27:14] CryMercy: its a passive trinket
[3:27:15] EKCrusher: no its actually sick
[3:27:18] TheSHAYdynasty: the welp is just a passive trinket, spawns a welp and shoots something
[3:27:19] The_Faceless_Void: its a passive
[3:27:21] Call_me_Erebus: the passive is aoe
[3:27:22] EKCrusher: it simmed top 10 on aoe
[3:27:22] zagnorath: it gives haste proc
[3:27:24] geminitrades: the puzzle box is BIS by FAR just look at blodmallet nothing compares @shroud
[3:27:25] doucettt: its super good
[3:27:29] FENIXHAZE10: it is a pssive trinket is good, but not great
[3:27:31] geminitrades: blood*
[3:27:32] alpehue: The passive is decent!
[3:27:34] Ferpectpanda: @shroud its really good, the proc does the same as the cooldown, its just an extra, the proc does a massive aoe and procs often
[3:27:36] Winnverine: the proc rate on the trinket is bad, but it can do crazy damage
[3:27:40] imthewumpus: lol why are you saying it is terrible are you misunderstanding the proc dragon whelp spawn?
[3:28:05] imthewumpus: just see how well it shows up on your DPS meters
[3:28:07] AbsolutPstachio: You tell your welp what to do for the day. If you activate it on an ally then for 24 hours your welp focusing on healing. If you activate it on an enemy your welp passive does damage for 24 hours
[3:28:08] dose1: what race is best to pvp for an alliance priest?

[3:28:52] FENIXHAZE10: you need to be 272 to get 285 from super rares
[3:28:59] pantry_: there is a weakaura for "super elites"
[3:29:03] y_pipe: Every Echo Player Farmer the Trinket on 9 chars each,gotta be Decent
[3:29:15] pantry_: will tell you which ones to kill, the zone and disappear when you kill it
[3:29:19] tachos___: is this game any good?
[3:29:32] keyserv: If an extra 42 agility is better than having the mastery buff from puzzle box then it's worth it.  But those, "summons a whatever to take up space on the screen," trinkets never do any meaningful damage.
[3:29:40] Ferpectpanda: toss your healing totem out, its busted
[3:29:43] geminitrades: The only trinkets better than puzzlebox are as follows 1. Manic Grieftorch 8.26 2. Whispering Incarnate Icon 7.98 3. Hunger of the Pack 7.92 4. Algeth'ar Puzzle Box 7.7 @shroud

[3:33:57] GiveSpineHitbox: yea as a vanilla andy... offhand in my day is seriously reduced in dmg unless that changed best weapon = mh
[3:34:03] Bleedorang3: @Bleedorang3 gotcha, thanks for the clarification
[3:34:33] irrefutable_ire: Chat use FFZ audio compressor, then the music is louder
[3:34:36] sap_yaps: deh music is good vibez shroudYEPPERS
[3:34:38] alpehue: @montongob  Tanks are usually good at aoe burst, so if things die fast they might end on top, the longer the mobs live, the further down they will fast, as a generel rule.
[3:34:42] Pschepps: this UI is amazing. Do you have an import link or code?
[3:34:44] niveous_a: the free fire nova weapon looks crazy on that weapon
[3:34:49] p1xelcrafts: what is shroud's class ?
