[0:23:08] BBMezzy: Is this after the nerf to one of the melee runes?
[0:23:12] Lausten: Thats some fast time to kill
[0:23:14] LuiBMHunter: hmm 2 1h or a 2h I wonder

[0:23:47] Nibbel__: think the nerf is like 5% nerf
[0:23:57] Jack_the_Dipper: I'm really thinking of leaving Twitter. Getting so annoyed by people commenting with multiple comments on one tweet or commenting with something that isn't relevant to the tweet or try to promote their own account.
[0:24:31] FrostBeered: I get a lot of bots on my twitter
[0:24:40] LuiBMHunter: I deleted twitter but then I don't need to promote anything :)
[0:24:53] Raidr211: Not 40 yet.  How does the STV PvP event work?  See people always  LFG.
[0:24:57] Lausten: Thats the main reason I dont actively use Twitter, Facebook or any other social media like that, its just people looking for arguments..
[0:25:13] Jack_the_Dipper: Have a look at a BBC tweet and see the commetns
[0:25:19] Raidr211: how does it work though

[0:30:32] Nibbel__: Sabaton
[0:30:42] NeeK_23: so is this actual PVP or like Ashenvale where you avoided each other and kill worldbosses?
[0:30:43] Lausten: Why 2004?
[0:30:48] Layliah79: Disturbed :D
[0:30:59] Lausten: Ah right, makes sense
[0:31:30] athrem01: We started
[0:31:33] NeeK_23: I dont think I killed a single person in Ashenvale, or even saw a horde
[0:32:03] fetza108: @NeeK_23 it is FFA but people are grouping sadly
[0:32:39] Layliah79: FeelsOkayMan nymnCorn
[0:32:52] LuiBMHunter: watching the priest ermm
[0:33:03] Lausten: Just doing a warmup, dont forget to stretch Kappa
[0:33:30] NeeK_23: luring the enemy in to a false sense of superiority
[0:34:01] Daice_Live: 5 raiders from Daice_Live have joined!

[0:34:33] LuiBMHunter: yep :)
[0:34:50] LuiBMHunter: definately
[0:35:03] AdamShwaginz: yo how‚Äôs the mele hunter gameplay? hearing it‚Äôs the best spec to play rn
[0:35:15] LuiBMHunter: have you changed runes?
[0:35:36] LuiBMHunter: don't forget to rebuff lion as well

[0:37:51] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:38:25] LuiBMHunter: does melee  need more survival talents?
[0:38:36] athrem01: What did you play before hunter?
[0:38:36] LuiBMHunter: ohhh
[0:39:26] NeeK_23: and now back to melee
[0:40:10] NeeK_23: Dont think I could ever be happy not on a caster class. Melee sucks
[0:40:18] Lausten: Gotta rely more on group when being melee
[0:40:19] AdamShwaginz: I‚Äôve always really wanted a spec that was a hybrid of both mele and ranged. survival in retail kind of satisfies that for me but ehh
[0:41:00] LuiBMHunter: Pfft! Charge! Yolo!
[0:42:31] Lausten: 1 vs 5 you always lose
[0:42:37] Lausten: No matter the class
[0:42:39] AdamShwaginz: yes me lol
[0:42:40] NeeK_23: looks at mage, *dies*. feels accurate
[0:42:43] EmpathyLiveChat: yes :)
[0:42:50] LuiBMHunter: I think the trouble is - that all the other people here gear for pvp
[0:43:09] suzyq1503: good afternoon

[0:45:45] LuiBMHunter: mebbe you should start wiv critters and work your way up :)
[0:47:02] athrem01: Pet is still dead
[0:47:04] EmpathyLiveChat: I feel similar
[0:47:27] fooxytv: same, I haven't felt much into WoW at all lately
[0:47:34] EmpathyLiveChat: Is it too predictable? Yeah

[0:50:37] mikeygames: Phase 1 was brilliant, Phase 2 seemed a bit 'flat' profession wise, and especially rune wise.
[0:50:40] CrowMomocle: evilfmGREET  having my wake up coffee
[0:50:51] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:50:52] CrowMomocle: Phase two is after the honeymoon period
[0:50:57] EmpathyLiveChat: When we get to 40, we'll be stuck there for 2 months... then again at 50...
[0:51:00] CrowMomocle: settling in time now
[0:51:48] Lausten: No different than when an expansion launches its super hyped, then season 2 rolls arround and it cant keep the same number of players..
[0:52:27] Bjornsen95: Song name?
[0:52:31] BeefnBeanzTV: 5 raiders from BeefnBeanzTV have joined! 
[0:52:49] Bjornsen95: Holy shit, i forgot about that band, i used to listen to them back in like 2012
[0:53:06] CrowMomocle: I guess it's up to us to make our own fun discovering the new stuff they did add
[0:53:09] Bjornsen95: This song hit me HARD in nostalgia, but i didnt remember who the band was
[0:53:28] BeefnBeanzTV: Loving melee hunter that was a LONG stream lol
[0:53:40] mikeygames: for the average player no way, if you're not interested in pvp, then the only thing you get is the new raid which you need friends/guild for
[0:53:44] BeefnBeanzTV: like 10 hours om
[0:53:45] NeeK_23: rune, raid and pvp, that seems to be it
[0:54:01] BeefnBeanzTV: it seems better in pve
[0:54:18] BeefnBeanzTV: melee hunter in pvp = getting kited as a ranged class feelbadman
[0:54:25] Bjornsen95: Holy, i forgot how GOOD Red is
[0:54:29] CrowMomocle: Sadly I've not got stuck in yet. Getting keys to new house tomorrow and hopefully will have internet so I can play.
[0:54:31] Bjornsen95: Already over is such a banger
[0:54:36] CrowMomocle: unpacking can wait
[0:54:52] S3N71: Good afternoon MrGM and stream chat
[0:55:07] mikeygames: Elden ring dlc in 5 mins! do you play Dark Souls series Dan?
[0:55:23] CrowMomocle: Tip for your later years, do NOT collect loads and loads of STUFF.
[0:55:46] CrowMomocle: collections
[0:55:50] NeeK_23: new Eldren Ring means new insufferable gamers.
[0:56:18] mikeygames: ranged >>>
[0:56:32] S3N71: BM is the way forward in PvP, imho
[0:56:34] mikeygames: should be on a warrior or something if you wanted melee
[0:56:35] CrowMomocle: my late husband collected magazines, bus models, and we had thousands of books and cds and LPs
[0:56:38] twin_cloud: Give it a good PVE Chance
[0:56:44] CrowMomocle: and I hate throwing stuff out
[0:56:52] CrowMomocle: I can't play hunter as melee
[0:56:58] NeeK_23: youre a hunter. Right now youre just being hunted. embrace the distance a bow brings
[0:57:28] mikeygames: #fun
[0:57:56] twin_cloud: Zerg pvp is never fun lol
[0:59:23] S3N71: How many bloods have you accumulated so far?
[1:00:43] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50
[1:00:58] S3N71: I'd come help, but my destroyer of worlds fire mage is only level 16, sorry
[1:01:21] Valen033: Valen033 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:03:44] SlithTheSivak: Keeping up with the Jones'
[1:03:55] S3N71: I don't feel P2 has continued the 'what if' scenarios we embraced in P1
[1:04:25] SlithTheSivak: dat elden ring trailer in 26min..
[1:04:26] mikeygames: Be alright if they put that bengal tiger 'somewhere' in-game for us explorers
[1:05:18] mikeygames: if the playerbase found all the runes in 24 hours, I'm sure they would of found the tiger etc or anything else.   I'm exploring higher level zones but not seeing much of anything new
[1:05:30] RAF_Sean: Good morning legend
[1:06:43] mikeygames: If you don't raid/pvp or do dungeons there's no point to put it bluntly.
[1:07:09] CrowMomocle: Also with phase one there were all the others who joined guilds and were keen together. That was an added excitement.
[1:07:12] RAF_Sean: That is a very well worded and rational tweet. Deffo gonna bring out the chuds lol
[1:07:19] S3N71: I do approve of the XP boost for < level 25 alts :)
[1:07:19] phopheter: did you do gnomeregan already ?

[1:08:15] Pumba2988: your'e just more pumped 10.2.6 than SoD
[1:08:30] Layliah79: then take a break from it and go back to ATT retail
[1:08:38] Layliah79: maybe after a break it might be better
[1:08:52] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:08:54] SlithTheSivak: calm before the storm...10.2.6 and alpha is just a couple weeks away
[1:09:10] NeeK_23: well it is Pandaria TW so could go do some ATT content for a day or so
[1:09:11] S3N71: Roll on TWW alpha
[1:09:20] AdamShwaginz: what would you have liked to see in this phase (if you haven't said already)
[1:09:56] AdamShwaginz: KEKW
[1:10:39] keyboardturner: some games just aren't really "streaming games" tbh, like for example i don't think i could ever stream my personal "immersion" skyrim build, but i would stream a funny thomas the tank engine dragons mod skyrim
[1:10:46] AdamShwaginz: yeah I fucking hate that LFG bulletin board addon
[1:10:55] ArcavusX: I agree, no one likes Gnomer. It is way too big and confusing for a dungeon. But for a RAID....? It's actually a really good size.
[1:10:57] Mister_Kooze: As someone who leveled 30-40 in SM, I don't think my brain could handle more SM right now lol. Gnomer is pretty sweet honestly
[1:11:14] RAF_Sean: Big agree.
[1:11:23] AdamShwaginz: @RAF_Sean hi handsome
[1:11:28] fetza108: I think this opened beta testing was not the best option too. We should have waited for like 1 year and after a ptr we could have played.
[1:11:32] Phats66: they dont say full, you just get radio silence
[1:11:38] Pumba2988: wyeah man agree 100%
[1:12:07] phopheter: After all these years i'm glad they finally gave gnomeregan some love
[1:12:33] NeeK_23: have you seen the old post from Ion in 2014 saying wow would be around in 2024 and all the comments mocking him?
[1:12:34] RAF_Sean: @AdamShwaginz Hello gorgeous. Looking good on the gym posts! Loved your slow mo leg machine vid ;)
[1:12:44] mikeygames: join the spam group then leave
[1:12:46] keyboardturner: join a spam group and do it once
[1:12:53] AdamShwaginz: @AdamShwaginz lol thank you sir <3
[1:12:58] LuiBMHunter: do it once then fake a d/c :)
[1:13:14] LuiBMHunter: well spose that *might* give it away
[1:13:24] AdamShwaginz: I mean the runs go so quick anyway, I've been loving spamming lately
[1:13:28] LuiBMHunter: wow players aren't that bright tho :)
[1:13:43] RAF_Sean: Oh man I would love to see some Scarlet Monastery action
[1:14:31] S3N71: Coffee time :)
[1:14:39] fetza108: i wanted to say we should have a ptr without this beta testing (what we are doing now) after a year development in 2025. sometimes i feel like this sod is in alpha state now.
[1:14:53] AdamShwaginz: grab what gachiBASS
[1:15:02] CrowMomocle: gonna go hit the loo
[1:15:08] CrowMomocle: is what I say
[1:15:12] Pumba2988: anyone know if Mr GM uses OBS for streams
[1:15:15] CrowMomocle: but then I'm not always too couth
[1:15:32] mikeygames: @Pumba2988 think so
[1:16:11] Pumba2988: @mikeygames yeah sweet thx i thought its popular
[1:16:36] RAF_Sean: No shot
[1:16:55] Pumba2988: can you buy a summon thats degen
[1:17:19] ArcavusX: Happened to me ysterday too :/
[1:17:29] BBMezzy: Nice social experience
[1:17:35] mikeygames: it's crazy to think that back in the day when we all played classic in 2005/2006, traveling 8-20 mins on a flight path was considered normal
[1:17:43] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:18:02] databob1: NA server shutdown
[1:18:12] keyboardturner: not by much
[1:18:14] Pumba2988: 2-3 mins
[1:18:29] mikeygames: they are more direct now on retail I think
[1:18:42] S3N71: I just use dynamic flying in retail.  What's a flight point?
[1:20:28] nikaidozz: it was fine
[1:22:25] Lausten: Do you get a bonus for wearing all mail in classic?
[1:22:51] mikeygames: you haven't got aspect of the hawk on, so itll be higher

[1:28:33] Suze_o_0: hunters dont have mana, we have focus.....
[1:29:17] RAF_Sean: @Lausten hahaha if I knew anything about SOD I'd consider it

[1:30:21] SlithTheSivak: 1 min till elden ring
[1:30:22] Suze_o_0: yea, i think yesterday was actually monday xD
[1:30:30] ArcavusX: Server shutdown AGAIN *cries*
[1:31:06] twin_cloud: Not me forgetting about maint and being in a tw dungeon D:
[1:31:37] Kubwa7: right now, it's everyday :(
[1:31:40] Lausten: The real people got off work and watched it, the people that comment 5 min after are obviously your trolls/haters who have it out for you..
[1:31:42] Kubwa7: fired wrong people?
[1:31:45] TruVillainManny: You have to realize that we of the WoW community must always comment the unexpected
[1:31:56] Jelky55: i told u before and i ll tell u again - you have the best and most funniest haters i've seen and i love to see them being mad for nothing
[1:33:27] Lausten: I saw it 15 minutes after it was uploaded and you had comments that was uploaded 5 minutes ago at that point.. And the video is not even 10 minutes long, so they really were quick to come at you with negative comments..
[1:34:03] S3N71: My SoD Mage is currently levelling as fast as any alt I have in Retail!
[1:35:10] fetza108: yesterday i started the sm spam too. i got two level in graveyard. I continue today. :D
[1:35:42] fetza108: great gold and fast leveling
[1:35:56] Chesscape: Earlier you wondered how long a flight point from Booty Bay to Chillwind would take in retail, well over 10 minutes is the answer
[1:37:11] BBMezzy: Is that not just the original version?
[1:37:18] Jelky55: look havoc dh in classic !
[1:37:45] BBMezzy: Retail one that exists now is not the original animation
[1:38:04] fetza108: the new one looks great
[1:38:30] mrsrockguru: !discord
[1:38:31] StreamElements: https://discord.gg/MrGM
[1:41:01] Layliah79: you can only do the same leveling so many times before you burn out. just like in retail - at least with retail you have other options to level then questing.
[1:41:35] Thoreya: agreed with that. i got bored of phase 2 pretty quick. im back to retail and lvling a char in wrath to 80
[1:41:46] mrsrockguru: mrsrockguru subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Weee no more adverts
[1:42:17] Yanoru: There is not enough "Discovery" in SoD. The runes arent enough. Quests like the sleeping bag should be there much more.
[1:42:43] mrsrockguru: And joined the patron, but just to let you know the link to the discord from the patron does not work, you get a blank page  on discord.
[1:42:56] S3N71: I'm just preferring SoD to retail right now.  When I prefer retail more again, I'll simply switch back.  I have less and less gaming time, so play what I enjoy at the time

[1:43:54] RAF_Sean: Nice clickbait wowhead
[1:43:55] Layliah79: desperate for news
[1:44:02] RAF_Sean: lol
[1:44:17] RAF_Sean: I thought this was ALPHA information
[1:44:21] NeeK_23: no its the full backstory and how to access in game, its actuall quite good
[1:44:28] Layliah79: this is the quietest it's been since pre DF launch. news wise
[1:44:53] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:44:55] Layliah79: they could even just give us the dungeon pool for S4 or something to talk about lol
[1:44:58] Thoreya: prob crunch time from now till war within
[1:45:02] RAF_Sean: I wonder if the merger has caused some issues with the delivery of announcements
[1:45:04] Lausten: Maybe we will get it friday with the blue news
[1:45:11] LuiBMHunter: gasp!
[1:45:17] RAF_Sean: Like maybe new approval method or something
[1:45:18] Layliah79: wonder if we'll get to vote on the dungeons for S4 M+ again
[1:45:28] Thoreya: i dont think we'll get news till 10.2.6 next month tbh
[1:45:29] Lausten: So they literally have no news this week
[1:45:38] Thoreya: @Layliah79 we wont. its df dungeons
[1:45:39] NeeK_23: @Layliah79 its DF dungoens
[1:45:43] RAF_Sean: @Layliah79 I hope not >< Grimrail was the bane of my existence
[1:45:43] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50
[1:45:44] Layliah79: booo
[1:46:04] fetza108: I feel your post on twitter about sod. i didn't log into retail for like 1 month because of sod but i don't know why yesterday i felt the need to log in. I don't know what the problem is but in the beginning i felt the vibe but now it is just automatic. i don't feel excitement but i'm playing still. I don't know how long we can play this mode so I want to try out all the content.
[1:46:07] Layliah79: it's so quiet now and in a month we'll be overwhelmed with news/content
[1:46:10] Thoreya: prob not ready to showcase
[1:46:14] RAF_Sean: They probably don't want people to call them clickbait
[1:46:27] Thoreya: theyll prob wait closer to beta to do it
[1:47:25] demololtv: someone said this is the GDKP's revenge
[1:47:26] S3N71: I feel this apathy, for want of a better word, is quite normal.  Once the new expansion is released, I tend to just focus on alt levelling, farming achievements etc., as I feel the current expansion is over.  I'd be doing that right now if I wasn't playing SoD
[1:47:27] mrsrockguru: Yeah alpha might be after Hearthstone/10.2.6.
[1:47:42] RAF_Sean: This week in WOW: Dan crushed a Cathedral run as melee hunter
[1:47:43] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:47:46] S3N71: *announced
[1:48:00] demololtv: yeah lmaop
[1:48:11] demololtv: youll never really know if its an actual DDoS
[1:48:31] demololtv: haha
[1:48:39] SlithTheSivak: quite a few angry ex employees
[1:49:11] Lausten: I hope we will get an XP/Rep bonus soon, not that I really need to level more characters but still LUL
[1:49:26] NeeK_23: I logged on, leveled for an hour, logged off, havent been on since. Even now Retail has more for me to do than SoD
[1:49:47] fetza108: @S3N71 yes like apathy. i agreed with you
[1:50:51] RAF_Sean: I prefer the ATT stuff - but that's because watching SoD makes me sad that I don't like Classic lol
[1:50:56] S3N71: I enjoy completionist and ATT streams, as I then get the urge to give a whirl myself
[1:50:59] NeeK_23: you getting the legs in WC and failing was fun in P1. but idk sod isnt the draw I hoped it would be
[1:51:02] Layliah79: after Hearthstone event is done
[1:51:08] mrsrockguru: Heathstone first 11th - 18th then 10.2.6 some time after that
[1:51:33] fetza108: and dont read a lot about sod on blizzforum. we know what there is going on negativity, dont have fun and everything is bad :D
[1:51:37] Lausten: Get those reconbOne hampapMog ATT points.. Need more dopamine sounds..
[1:51:46] NeeK_23: Im hoping 15-22nd march, purely because I have that booked off work
[1:52:12] RAF_Sean: Any predictions on what the event will be?
[1:52:15] fetza108: yeah the opinions about sod is rather bad i think on blizzforum than good
[1:52:19] RAF_Sean: The 10.2.6 one I mean
[1:52:24] Layliah79: so until then we just wait FeelsStrongMan
[1:52:48] Layliah79: lots of new tmogs!
[1:52:52] RAF_Sean: Kind of hoping for Island Expeditions V2
[1:52:54] LuiBMHunter: Jaina leads a kul tiran invasion of stormwind!
[1:53:14] S3N71: Pirate runes ;-)
[1:53:40] fetza108: we know wow players are not happy about anything especially classic players :D :D
[1:54:11] NeeK_23: Im on whichever side Jaina is on
[1:54:23] Riverxlol: hopefully they rebuild, then garrosh can come back and wipe it out again :)
[1:54:31] mikeygames: she's with Sylvanus having a cuppa
[1:54:33] fetza108: @NeeK_23 PogO
[1:55:00] BBMezzy: Yes
[1:55:01] NeeK_23: she's having eel soup with Kalec and the Tuskarr according to the last we saw of her at the end of 10.2
[1:55:06] mikeygames: she'll make a return in Midnight and save Quel'thalas from the void, and redeem herself probs
[1:55:23] S3N71: Downside to the XP buff, the quests are turning grey before I get a chance to turn them in, lol
[1:55:46] fetza108: @NeeK_23 you like milfs Kappa
[1:55:51] mikeygames: thoughts on melee hunter in dungeons?
[1:56:31] Lausten: Arise my Champion!
[1:56:35] Lausten: At your side my Lady!
[1:56:37] NeeK_23: @fetza_twitch not a milf if she's the same age
[1:56:57] Lausten: Best boss in classic
[1:57:05] BBMezzy: Is there a point to hunters marking as a SoD melee hunter?
[1:57:20] NeeK_23: if she dies too fast you get no loot
[1:57:33] Lausten: That Whitemane Chapeau is the most memorable head item from vanilla I think
[1:58:13] handovdoom666: can't share it's a chain.
[1:58:33] fooxytv: get mana back
[1:58:42] LuiBMHunter: grats! Mana issues no more!
[1:58:42] handovdoom666: you will never run out of mana now
[1:58:55] Lausten: So you can keep pew pewing with those swords..
[1:59:31] Riverxlol: only 10%
[1:59:37] Riverxlol: aspect of viper is op in classic
[2:00:04] fetza108: i feel like the retail story line is rather for the alliance for a while. am i wrong? if you play horde the story is strange for you maybe for a long time.
[2:01:00] Lausten: Without a doubt the Alliance side was the main side in classic.. Onyxia taking the disguise of Lady Katrana Prestor in Stormwind for example
[2:01:06] fetza108: i played a lot horde in retail but i  like the lore and i felt strange in the man story so i started an alliance char.

[2:10:00] Layliah79: still here!!
[2:10:04] S3N71: Affirmative
[2:10:07] BBMezzy: Still lurking
[2:10:19] Layliah79: work is giving me a headache on the other screen
[2:10:28] RAF_Sean: Doing dishes but here
[2:10:31] lindlyn: working and Lurking
[2:10:31] Layliah79: :D
[2:10:53] RAF_Sean: @Layliah79 Just quit your job like I did, now I can watch Dan without interruption
[2:11:08] Hoedown: Doing some testing on the raptor strike normalization...still feels ok...decent tune imo
[2:11:09] RAF_Sean: disclaimer - I am not a certified career coach
[2:11:36] Layliah79: @RAF_Sean Haha!! Wish I could but those darn bills won't pay themselves! mrgmLUL
[2:11:53] Lausten: I can stream to my Google Nest so I guess
[2:11:53] S3N71: The Defias Messanger just set off from Moonbrook and left alive - wouldn't have happended 4 weeks ago ;-)
[2:12:08] Forgiven78: Yes you can i am watching yyou now on mine.
[2:13:35] Forgiven78: Yes
[2:13:44] Forgiven78: and i believe it supports multi cam mode as well
[2:13:54] JakeSezz: yeah my ring doorbell is tied to my Echo‚Äôs
[2:14:29] Lausten: No one bothers walk up to the third floor unless they need to, so I dont need a door bell LUL
[2:15:30] Lausten: No import buttons either, what is this modern version of classic Kappa
[2:16:25] Hoedown: shouldnt ever worry about mana costs after viper was put in...it fills so fast that wasting a talent just doesn't "spend" well
[2:16:58] Hoedown: 30 seconds to full
[2:17:06] Hoedown: no you toggle it on when you need mana
[2:17:16] LuiBMHunter: hawk then viper when out of mana then back to hawk?
[2:17:17] Hoedown: back and forth between hawk and viper etc
[2:17:43] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:18:54] Hoedown: BM is pretty bad dps wise...marksman isn't too bad though

[2:21:28] Lausten: !emote reconbJesus
[2:21:51] Hoedown: running a BM build you really should have the BM rune on your gloves. Only time you really switch off is if your running lone wolf (another hunter or pally providing kings/lion)
[2:22:20] Hoedown: solo, always lion BM runes
[2:23:13] NeeK_23: !emote mrgmOk

[2:24:43] NeeK_23: !emote mrgmG
[2:27:51] Hoedown: if you're lone wolf...carve
[2:28:43] Hoedown: nah only run carve if lone wolf. explosive will be better in groups, chimera for solo
[2:29:34] Hoedown: solo you wont pull multiple mobs...group you will....so that's where chimera vs explosive comes in
[2:30:12] Hoedown: explosive is crazy good in groups pulling big packs....6 second cd too
[2:31:10] Hoedown: when in dungeons I run trap launcher to keep frost down and then explosive shot/multishot weaving in some explosive traps
[2:31:24] Hoedown: it does very good
[2:32:00] Hoedown: I think that's what makes hunter so fun...so many different play styles
[2:32:35] Hoedown: Don't think what I'm saying is to sound elitist...you play how you want to...all just a game....have fun
[2:33:58] Hoedown: Once you start understanding how the runes can play into your groups it really opens up the class for you...really becomes fun to figure out what works best
[2:34:13] LuiBMHunter: I'm a sexy girl?
[2:34:23] Ironhide_Gaming: Does dragonriding allow you to fly to GM island?
[2:34:27] handovdoom666: I'm definitely a sexy girl
[2:34:28] LuiBMHunter: fairly sure i'm not
[2:34:45] handovdoom666: you can be whatever you want
[2:34:51] Hoedown: Lone wolf is really just for raiding...and only if there's another hunter in the group running lion. No rush to get that rune
[2:36:09] Hoedown: Not sure what the cost is now. It might get more expensive if people aren't farming the quest items
[2:37:20] Hoedown: turochargers going for 2g on my server

[2:37:39] handovdoom666: fish oil is mad cheap since theres tons of mobs that drop it now that are within 25-40
[2:37:46] LuiBMHunter: a million gold!
[2:37:51] Hoedown: it's not a gaurateed drop either, will need more than 16 :)
[2:38:22] handovdoom666: you need ~25 of those ENG items to get 16
[2:38:31] Hoedown: big dps increase if you can manage to run it in a raid
[2:38:53] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:41:32] Hoedown: rune, yes
[2:41:52] Hoedown: dungeons, helps the tank

[2:42:23] Hoedown: helps with farming too
[2:42:43] Hoedown: With trap launcher we can farm uldaman haha

[2:44:39] Lausten: I swear half of classic is flight paths

[2:59:47] Ironhide_Gaming: Headset
[3:02:24] chelfx: I really wonder what the new zone is
[3:03:13] WochiTV: afternoon
[3:03:25] WochiTV: all cool

[3:03:45] chelfx: Gm island
[3:04:12] chelfx: That's the other stormwind dng
[3:04:19] chelfx: In the clock tower
[3:05:35] Lausten: Someone sure spend a few hours making that back in 200x
[3:05:43] BBMezzy: That last big room could be an arena
[3:05:44] mrsrockguru: WoW they should use that, as a raid in stormwind
[3:05:56] TylerWolfXIII: Be a neat small raid.
[3:06:29] nyrhalahotep: sorry you had to write that ridiculous explainer tweet for your article, not everyone understands what should be obvious. "First, they fascinate the fools. Then, they muzzle the intelligent." ~ Bertrand Russell
[3:07:03] chelfx: Mega Scarlet
[3:08:21] TylerWolfXIII: This would be an amazing raid.
[3:08:49] Lausten: There have been rumors and whispers in the criminal underworld that The Defias Brotherhood have broken into the old closed down prison and are planning on blowing up Stormwind. Go investegate while I gather the Stormwind Police. Tada new raid with a small story
[3:08:54] S3N71: Maybe it'll be a P4 SoD Fated Raid
[3:10:06] TylerWolfXIII: @Lausten We can take that story as the beginning arc for Vanessa VanCleef after the Alliance killed her father.
[3:11:02] TylerWolfXIII: You know, an underwater Abomination Naga would be a neat fight for the underwater part.

[3:13:58] nyrhalahotep: I think the team that rendered that would appreciate seeing their work utilized
[3:14:01] chelfx: Reminds me of the old hayven games videos
[3:14:26] TylerWolfXIII: Like SoD has the potential to use their old content due to finally having the proper software to run it.
[3:15:01] chelfx: And it's new not really lore breaking
[3:15:13] Hoedown: It's hard to do something like the Stormwind one cause they'd have to come up with some story to allow horde in stormwind city (lorewise)
[3:15:17] Lausten: It would be cool to see them make use of these old maps to make new stuff instead of "destroying" peoples oppotunity to go into Gnomeregan
[3:15:43] StreamElements: EARLY LOOK at Khaz Algar Zones in The War Within (Pre-Alpha) - https://youtu.be/XbrZRxCSM50

[3:17:05] nyrhalahotep: I love my steady shot rune from Arathi, big mana saver
[3:17:09] TylerWolfXIII: I should know because I wanted to scream doing that entire bullshit series.
[3:17:13] Hoedown: thats a bug
[3:17:21] Lausten: That rune is bugged
[3:17:27] Hoedown: have to delete your wow cache and reload game
[3:17:32] Vidaloo: Buggy bug rune
[3:17:34] nyrhalahotep: that's definitely a bug
[3:17:38] TylerWolfXIII: It's Runed
[3:17:40] Lausten: Mantieus had the same issue

[3:19:05] RAF_Sean: McDonald‚Äôs for coffee
[3:19:11] Hoedown: go across the bridge to farm them
[3:19:46] S3N71: BP Red Bean coffee is the best.  McDs a close second
[3:20:32] chelfx: McDonald's coffee in Canada is good, they bought up the Tim Hortons coffee after the coffee company held it hostage trying to charge extra to Tim Hortons
[3:20:51] RAF_Sean: I like that it‚Äôs consistently good. Never have a bad cup
[3:20:59] Lausten: That area usually is swamped with mobs

[3:31:43] Hoedown: in phase 1 I kept leveling an alt to 25....do all the max level quests and delete/reroll...about 180g perchar and each took about 2.5 days...was lucrative
[3:31:53] iRegretn0thing: Im struggling to have a single questing zone to get me from 25 to 30 without jumping all over.
[3:32:21] Hoedown: at level 40 it will take a lot more time haha
[3:32:53] Hoedown: but leveling alts for that keeps your main from eating up all their quests
[3:32:57] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove

[3:37:37] iRegretn0thing: a what? >_>
[3:38:25] Hoedown: you'll need a group for the chest quest last part
[3:38:48] Hoedown: its worth it

[3:39:54] Hoedown: yeah lot of farming for the chicken quest
[3:41:57] Hoedown: I just turn in cloth for exalted rep for mount

[3:52:53] iRegretn0thing: Its been the case for like a month
[3:53:19] onikid89: guess after 2 months of farming i might get it today?
[3:53:35] onikid89: i was thinking the same thing :))
[3:53:36] iRegretn0thing: tbh I thought they were gonna do something similar to the sylvanas bow drop boost from S4
[3:54:32] iRegretn0thing: we definitely need leggos like the FL staff again tho
[3:54:42] iRegretn0thing: drop ones dont seem to work out as much anymore
[3:55:01] onikid89: quest then farm ? if i remember good
[3:55:07] iRegretn0thing: Its a quest you get when you start progressing
[3:55:25] onikid89: yea
[3:55:57] iRegretn0thing: feels better to see your progression as you go, rather than be blind to a drop. Even if it takes as long to get, probably feels better seeing some form of progress
