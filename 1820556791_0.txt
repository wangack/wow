[0:33:41] krimzin_wizard: cringe take L
[0:33:41] Swithorn: world buffs shouldn't be a thing at all
[0:33:41] FrostwulfTV: Classic players complain raids are too easy then pop every buff known to man to make it easier
[0:33:42] Jaivenx: why troll
[0:33:43] Hudman73: we didn't have quest helper in 2005 WTF
[0:33:45] Whitehamma: It's like addons, if you have them, your going to use them @sodapoppin

[0:34:01] Dunderbarn: i think the concept overall is cool, like dropping the ony head for something but the whole culture around it got way out of hand
[0:34:01] jifjam: its so funny classic players hate borrowed power, but they LOVE world buffs!
[0:34:06] r0xorzb0xorz: WORLD BUFFS SHOULD BE BANNED IN HARDCORE. IF YOU USE THEM, YOU ARE A PUSSY.

[0:34:15] embrs: nah make it a disqualifier for all, if a toon get a buff because they happened to be in town a button pops that they click to dismiss the buff
[0:34:15] Reticent_88: @BatmanUn1corn SoM was dead because everyone had just finished playing vanilla on the original servers. Not because of world buffs

[0:35:53] batsun1corn: axe Gayge
[0:35:55] Millehx: Me and my friends do something similar. We delete half of our gear upon death. Not allowed to use AH etc like on hardcore. Only difference is literally that instead of perma death, you delete half your gear, based on slot number and roll 1-18.
[0:35:55] Satoszi: rizz him up
[0:35:55] hyphyted: sup
[0:35:55] outofmaana: hardcore is for low testosterone players.
[0:36:00] embrs: yeah but it wasnt the original intent for the level of buff stacking, and those buff stacks make it not very hardcore
[0:36:01] mizkifsrecedinghairline: Are there Hardcore servers with PvP too?  That would be toxic as fuck.

[0:37:23] Anckael: yea for ironman
[0:37:23] grizzlyhead: do you hate it because of the down time of having to go getting the buff? @sodapoppin
[0:37:23] tomo123: I mean its not a problem to get buffs when pvp is off
[0:37:24] Eaglebrace: ye the addon gonna have some use still
[0:37:25] trollman_9: if fun is tension when close to death why you do green and grey quests?

[0:37:27] Annurco: Hc peeps doing aq last night said thy would play whatever blizz gives them
[0:37:27] Reticent_88: It's not 'hardcore' for somebody to level only while they have world buffs. Impossible to die when you 2-shot everything
[0:37:28] handgestured: @sodapoppin Whats the point of using addon on official servers, HC mods cant appeal shit when you die
[0:37:30] Crossfirev: tell me
[0:37:31] TheColdBacon: @spicyfishalmond yet youre here watching it still
[0:37:32] PushesButtons: the add on stops blizz from ruining it
[0:37:33] outofmaana: @Crossfirev they also announced fresh :) HC is for low T people who wanna sit and grind green mobs and take 0 risk all day. "look how challenging!" Lets play a very slow game in a even slower manner
[0:37:33] rusty414: addon + hc server wont work, addon dev cant appeal your death

[0:37:58] willys_pinballpub: Biggest problem is no appeals with official servers. DC's
[0:37:58] FilthyCasuaILive: you cant use the AH , you cannot transfer a non HC character to a HC server

[0:38:13] nautabass: Aware
[0:38:13] SynSeed: but wont it be stopped by the server itself?

[0:38:13] Fossabot: PaEu ( ° ͜ʖ͡°)╭∩╮

[0:38:18] Eatingtime: true. at least the entire auction house will be made up of things gotten on perma death characters @sodapoppin
[0:38:19] Zymory: you say it like its a bad thing
[0:38:19] folypill: rogues should be able to pickpocket other peoples gold from their bags
[0:38:19] krimzin_wizard: BabyRage i care how others play the game
[0:38:20] Deamonic68: @sodapoppin will there be bots if its 1 life server?
[0:38:21] goblinpride: people will always find a way to beat the system, for sure
[0:38:21] MisterChow: real HC will be just as toxic as normal servers

[0:38:23] Jimmy_Large: wouldn't the pickpocket bots die to the cast being resisted sometimes?
[0:38:24] Onlind: grouping should be allowed
[0:38:24] angelbutt3: Dumb
[0:38:24] Shalestorm: Retrail system for Named mob tagging

[0:38:25] Wrathedd: grouping and playing the game NOOOO
[0:38:26] lakeybc: I like grouping for tags and elite quests personally
[0:38:26] isrx: Hopefully they can use the PTR to refine the ruleset
[0:38:28] Anckael: They should limit dungeons to atleast daily in official servers
[0:38:29] plakkver: You have to suffer
[0:38:30] willys_pinballpub: Ehhh hogger gets plenty of kills
[0:38:31] kubiskos: True, also it will be so disappointing if there will be 0 changes to hardcore servers
[0:38:31] F4RTLOVER: they just need to increase spawn rate of the named mobs
[0:38:31] jifjam: the hardcore experience is different from the classic leveling experience, but blizz wants to meld them
[0:38:32] tenaja22: turtle wow does it well, people still open world. ah is turned off till 60.
[0:38:33] choppeddx: who fuckin cares what the rules are the community will ruin the game mode and burn it to the ground
[0:38:33] krimzin_wizard: BabyRage i care how others play the game BabyRage
[0:38:33] Vesir_1: make tagging like retail
[0:38:34] Qeevdo: tags share up to 5 ppl like in retain would be nice
[0:38:36] baudet94: @sodapoppin what if there is a 3 day lockout for dungeons?
[0:38:36] Ampitere: that's more of an issue with tagging than hc itself
[0:38:36] kketom: ok
[0:38:37] Stronkendary: social credit tags
[0:38:37] tomo123: Soda thats not what average player does

[0:38:38] jayveemilla: Make the taggable mobs like retail imo
[0:38:39] SL4SK3N: Grouping in an mmo DansGame
[0:38:39] Everee: they should have lock outs for dungeons every day/week
[0:38:39] khanlyb: not if its still the 1 dungeon rule
[0:38:40] oldmandrama: wait you wont be allowed to group in official?
[0:38:41] VerdeSol3: lauren hill
[0:38:41] dirkdiglet: cause you are a streamer. They just watch me 1v1 it
[0:38:42] narexa: isnt that the entire point of a PTR?
[0:38:42] glavataliman: they should raise ID limit of dungeons to at least 5
[0:38:43] ScumBot: Or just buff respawns on the named mobs lol
[0:38:45] krimzin_wizard: doomer take L
[0:38:45] Shalestorm: @krimzin_wizard .....thats why boosties can just uh not use the addon and not get into addon guilds and groups

[0:38:50] sad0____: make named 1 or 2 minutes spawn. problem solved.

[0:38:51] CasualTryhrd: 5 tags would be nice
[0:38:52] Iam_StoneK: I agree

[0:38:54] goblinpride: @krimzin_wizard how others play in hc directly impacts your own experience

[0:39:02] 115Vvinny: did he die on druid again? PepeLaugh

[0:39:21] singo00: Why would the need so long time if they only gona add Dead = dead
[0:39:23] automata33: you missed it
[0:39:23] sirblowsalot: appeals goes against the very nature of hc, screw appeals
[0:39:25] MrFallenCrab: Why? If Blizzard would actually put some work into it and make those things embedded into the server itself, at least it would show players they care
[0:39:27] Krydun: missed tag again sadge
[0:39:27] bigblaur: they can just take out the AH NPCs and create a 1 dungeon limit on characters. that solves ur problems right?
[0:39:28] automata33: you did
[0:39:29] Elarisiel: just make dungeons mobs gives 99% reduced exp and increase dungeon quests exp
[0:39:29] KingDiabetic: Where vei is she liking usa
[0:39:29] qubilly: baby hardcore, you die and appeal every death :)
[0:39:30] DuduVi: The dungeon has an easy fix, nerf to hell dungeon kill xp, make just the quests give xp, so it is good to do it once for the quests and more if you want specific items, not xp
[0:39:31] goingupthemountain: this is so much more fun to watch than druid

[0:39:37] Dunderbarn: Not "they" you summoned it for them
[0:39:39] New_Game_Plus_o7: they should just add an ironman mode too. People not into hc could do it and hc could add it on.
[0:39:40] baudet94: @sodapoppin 24 hour lockout per dungeon, increase quest xp to 300%, reduce mob xp to 5%
[0:39:41] goblinpride: @krimzin_wizard Why? The whole appeal of hc servers is a set challenge, there has to be certain rules to make it engaging
[0:39:43] VerdeSol3: idk
