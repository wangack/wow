[0:11:24] zachl_: @Schnuwuuu do you recognize the cadence of which ones u can and cant dispell?
[0:11:27] Ventorpoe: @yumytv i sent on disc
[0:11:53] Ventorpoe: focus up prodigy
[0:11:59] xWB1: oh heck posture check
[0:12:10] Schnuwuuu: ah so there is a certain time when they overlap more? hmmm, so do the fight over and over :D got it
[0:12:10] thepleasuremachine: make sure immersive sck is on
[0:12:41] thetrainboat: do you ever sing Roger Pontare @ karaoke?
[0:12:59] zachl_: @Schnuwuuu kinda, the first 3 dispells u can get for free on cd, after the 3rd they start coming out in intervals of about 6s, so the strat after first few is to anticipate an answer to the dot that isnt dispell
[0:12:59] mythmaster1337: a destro wl tho
[0:13:02] mythmaster1337: not demo
[0:13:36] Dotctori: Yooo prodigy gaming Pog

[0:13:46] zachl_: @Schnuwuuu also, the same person cannot get the dot 2x in one given interval of dots, so you can kinda assume which people are gonna get hit
[0:14:04] Schnuwuuu: oh really? that's nice to know.
[0:14:24] zachl_: yep! hopefully that helps u figure out kinda how to address it... what healer do u play?
[0:14:24] Schnuwuuu: i try to dispell squishy first and keep it on dhs or something. but i got my first 25+ tyran now and iam a bit afraid :D
[0:14:50] Schnuwuuu: monk and evoker. monk is easier but i still struggle sometimes when the tank gets hit hard and i have to keep him alive too
[0:15:01] Meteox: DH noises
