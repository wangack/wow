[0:05:50] budmodeos: haven’t touched my lvl 25 warlock in sod since dinging 25. looking forward to phase 2.
[0:05:56] acaciashrub: did all runes really get datamined D:
[0:06:03] acaciashrub: i dont wanna look and spoil it
[0:06:04] flamgoosee: feb 8 @aspensav
[0:06:09] whipprsnapper: i might have to reroll shaman
[0:06:15] lurkerl0l: Yo xar what it do
[0:06:35] Octane33: Phase 2 Hype inc!  So pumped for this stream!
[0:07:06] Kayn___________: lets do some pvp teorycrafting for p2
[0:07:15] budmodeos: I definitely spoiled it and read all the warlock runes on wowhead. not exciting on the surface, but it seems like big dodge enhancement, and percentage of damage increases. I’ll take it.
[0:07:16] inspect4: tierlist time ofc
[0:07:47] cabeshpash: I'm just happy ret is good now lol
[0:07:48] acaciashrub: awe man im sad they actually got datamined before release but ill wait till we go over them in here to atleast keep SOME of the suspense :/
[0:07:58] budmodeos: I don’t think it is spoiling it. it’s the rp.  if there are new magic items across the world, word gets out fast
[0:08:15] Stingin: Good morning xarbar & chat!
[0:09:11] malkyth: Knowing what's coming is one thing. Finding them the first time is another.
[0:09:40] NotSeger: Sucks how everything gets datamined on WoW
[0:09:53] NotSeger: Games like PoE and FF14 do a great job in hiding stuff
[0:10:13] wowsuomi: Hsven't read about any f it yet
[0:10:14] Stingin: I'm enjoying Enshrouded so much
[0:10:35] cabeshpash: I don't mind stuff getting data mined, you don't have to look at the results lol
[0:10:50] Stingin: Got my wife to play with me! theaim9Ban stingBonk
[0:11:20] BrianAffair: xaryu hype xaryu hype
[0:11:26] Octane33: Even though the runes have been datamined not all of them make it into phase 2 right?
[0:11:27] cabeshpash: xarTroll xarTroll xarTroll
[0:11:34] thatboygsp: the only person spoiling anything for you if it's datamined is yourself, even Wowhead put a big fat "SPOILER" banner with the article title.
[0:12:20] docbhudda: soniiWave soniiWave soniiWave soniiWave soniiWave
[0:12:23] pattyp1101: fake data mines watch
[0:12:30] goatedsp: @thatboygsp Xaryus overweight millenial 36 year old audience is too stupid to understand how the internet works
[0:12:33] connguy1: DEEP FREEZE HYPE
[0:12:38] pattyp1101: some real some fake
[0:13:03] copper_cloud: here we go, time for b f d for thoe 1000th time ResidentSleeper
[0:13:10] Yahfz: @copper_cloud OMEGALUL
[0:13:18] cabeshpash: @RankOnePDF dude the internet became popular when we were young, if anyone understands the internet it's millennials lol
[0:13:21] thatboygsp: @pattyp1101 nothing datamined is guaranteed until it actually releases.
[0:13:43] cabeshpash: I miss netscape navigator days
[0:13:47] Yahfz: ill kill myself if i have to do bfd one more time
[0:13:52] Yahfz: (im gonna do it 3 more times)
[0:14:00] heygoditsme: o7
[0:14:02] Stingin: I literally just finished my raid bis in BFD and it took like 30+ runs, seems most ppl are ready for phase 2 finally
[0:14:06] thatboygsp: @RankOnePDF I for one enjoy reading datamined stuff, i like seeing how things are gonna potentially change.
[0:14:19] copper_cloud: @Stingin imagine the people who got it in a couple weeks..
[0:14:26] thatboygsp: @Yahfz just 3? I still got about 20 in me o7
[0:14:32] Stingin: That's just pure luck copper
[0:14:36] Yahfz: its cause its 3 more until  phase 2
[0:14:58] Yahfz: well i guess more if you have more characters o7
[0:15:04] skrakampf: thank god they banned gdkps
[0:15:06] slpzagaming: Did everyone remember to do their dailies?
[0:15:09] thatboygsp: @Yahfz *cries* but i have every class.
[0:15:14] copper_cloud: @Stingin statistically it was going to happen to a lot of people. this was bad idea for phase 1
[0:15:16] Yahfz: o7
[0:15:16] Xeliumimar: @skrakampf how dare you!
[0:15:20] Stingin: Out of 30 runs we saw strike of hydra once and Turlock bag twice, no crossbow and no staff, how unlucky is that
[0:15:26] raykarben: !death
[0:15:26] Stingin: Murlock*
[0:15:26] StreamElements: We all died... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaEDWAAAWp8
[0:15:26] cabeshpash: it's gonna be really hard to enforce the GDKP ban it seems like tho
[0:15:28] sixetqt: are we playing WoW again? POG
[0:15:37] copper_cloud: yeah im sure theres already a gdkp discord
[0:15:41] Yahfz: @Stingin bro im still missing my serrakis
[0:15:45] thatboygsp: @Stingin about as unlucky as seeing the staff 6 times on a resto druid and never winning the roll.
[0:15:49] Yahfz: it never drops
[0:15:51] handovdoom666: i still enjoy BFD. it's quick. imagine if they made BRD into a raid. that would take hours.
[0:16:01] ZhangTuShi: im going to hug you when you read mage :)
[0:16:05] heygoditsme: @Stingin i did 20+ runs on my rogue the mh sword only dropped twice and warriors got it both time
[0:16:10] sixetqt: @Stingin on my second run yesterday i won the staff with a 99 roll, talk about lucky, rest of 2024 will be 0 luck
[0:16:15] Joxtirol: DEEP FREEZ Hype
[0:16:23] danielbanks: I've been doing bfd since week 2 and never seen staff
[0:16:23] Stingin: Dude it's crazy, My hunters and caster guildies are so upset about it. Phase 2 with no epic drop
[0:16:24] Yahfz: that stupid crossbow always fucking drops
[0:16:28] slpzagaming: @cabeshpash dude I play turtle wow pvt server and not a single GDKP gets by unnoticed. I'm certain the official Blizzard team can weed out the GDKP runs on retail
[0:16:34] thatboygsp: @heygoditsme guildmate rogue on our guild has never seen the talwar drop since launch. and its all he needs for bis.
[0:16:41] heygoditsme: but that sword is not even epic for fck sake :D
[0:16:44] hellseesyou: @slpzagaming after they remove a wow token :)
[0:16:46] heygoditsme: just let me have it
[0:16:57] Seoken1: xarNerdge xarPrime xarNerdge xarPrime
[0:16:59] heygoditsme: @thatboygsp crazyy right
[0:17:00] slpzagaming: @hellseesyou haha ok fair enough
[0:17:01] yoslo1: I am pumped did a parse run yesterday with my guild and I was able to bring my average from 40 to 74 pretty stoked. I brought everyone of my fight parses to a new highest.
[0:17:09] billager91: Took my guild over 30 runs to get the Talwar to drop. Crazy.
[0:17:26] cabeshpash: @slpzagaming IDK blizzard is so bad at banning gold buyers that they just caved in and added the tokens to the game
[0:17:31] billager91: Staff and Crossbow dropped twice each
[0:17:35] slpzagaming: eeeeeeee
[0:17:35] thatboygsp: @heygoditsme and then theres my rogue who's had it since first run and missing most of the gear. lol

[0:17:46] hellseesyou: @slpzagaming i mean its the only reason why they banning gdkp, they are too lazy to deal with bots and cant sell wow tokens just yet ... i would not be surprised if they allowed gdkp again in phase three and said "OH HERES WOW TOKEN" :-D

[0:56:53] Karntar: glad warrior Pog
[0:57:02] Spring_Hell: @Hyperioz don't think so. I also want to have that clarified because it says it's for arcane spells affecting multiple targets so I wonder if LF still operates as it used to when it's a single target
[0:57:03] Mahca_: @boomhonker I think this phase is boots and belt based on their video
[0:57:05] ajchimica: @xaryu bracers and helm are being tested for p3, boots and belt are what we know is coming to p2

[0:57:25] Getz31: Can we have link for this ruines?
[0:57:27] exxxtended: I’d love to see warrior tank swap to more sword and board instead of 2h dps to maintain threat.

[1:00:40] Curtsy: @tetsuaka4 They already stated that they are most likely never adding arena
[1:00:43] Aptness: there is a 2hander spell power sword too from the bloodmoon pvp vendor. pretty slick
[1:00:45] xNotorietyx: @bramicmar yes
[1:00:48] Spring_Hell: @bramicmar what?

[1:01:35] bramicmar: @Resonance_Cero ah okay thanks haha, wanted to see his reaction
[1:01:37] jonquicks_: warr need shattering throw. all we need really cause fuck these filthy paladins
[1:01:39] dramajohns: isnt 4 extra runes slot too much for 1 phase ?
[1:01:42] alf_hd: Wsg bracers bis?
[1:01:43] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: so many reused spells
[1:01:52] Curtsy: @tetsuaka4 gonna have to do gank squads if you want small acale pvp
[1:01:57] hellseesyou: its not all going to phase two thats for sure, thers no way they gonna dump 20 +runes in ph2
[1:02:00] Jubilation12: @dramajohns yea we prob just getting boots and beltr
[1:02:04] LegendOfKilla: gachiBASS
[1:02:08] OtherguyTTV: hi sir, do you think spellhancer will be a thing with fire nova and maelstrom runes....same like in wotlk
[1:02:10] NotASkiller: very interactive in pvp.. totally won't be super op.
[1:02:10] cair178: look at the pally set too
[1:02:10] BlueNeoh: Sacred Shield prob better still
[1:02:19] Tdoh__: rogues get lay on hands on a 3 second cooldown, and it restores 100 energy per lay on hands
[1:02:24] CasualTryhrd: @dramajohns I think they just have the data for all these in the files and we'll only get like 2 new slots or something
[1:02:25] Curtsy: @hellseesyou They already said that a lot of these will never see the light of day
[1:02:26] acaciashrub: its defs just boots/belt and the ones on same slots as p1
[1:02:28] treyywow: Shockadin will never actually be good tho
[1:02:33] epicmadnesss: @xaryu did u read about warlock
[1:02:36] treyywow: maybe for PvP
[1:02:38] bramicmar: @Tdoh__ off GCD too
[1:02:40] NotASkiller: getting ran down by paladins who can't be killed... very good balancing blizzard.
[1:02:45] Exusprime: Fake = holy wrath is lvl 50
[1:02:47] hellseesyou: @Curtsy yea yea i meant more about the slots, its gonna be two slots at max (which is 8 runes in total per char)
[1:02:50] justingatlin: paladin is now caster dps its really stupid and not classic like, same for rogues RANGE stun it makes no sense
[1:02:52] ChaosEmperor24: this doesnt seem great. they rely too much on 1 playstyle here. pushing too much
[1:02:52] Noviike: Numbers seem way too big haha
[1:02:56] serverfirst300003: paladin looks so much more fun than war already
[1:02:56] Kubeniz: @Xaryu Some of these are fake, bait for dataminers we won't get them all
[1:02:57] dramajohns: @Jubilation12 thats prob for the best. I hope so
[1:03:00] xNotorietyx: I think only belt/boots are p2
[1:03:00] ghosey94: Think its only belt and boot runes for phhase 2 though right?
[1:03:00] Curtsy: Talking about synergy when you just read that some of these wont make it to live @Xaryu KEKW
[1:03:06] SilkeySmooth: wait until you see the shaman runes
[1:03:07] naturalduck: brb making paladin
[1:03:08] magrausla: 25% crit more like

[1:03:34] skwumberton: can someone link this
[1:03:39] malvarcla: pronounce the third 3 as an s
[1:03:39] yurchelioz: resto shamans looks so shitty compared to unbelievable buffs for holy paladin jesus christ
[1:03:41] CasualTryhrd: 1 or 2 slots per new phase gotta be the way
[1:03:42] turn2spikejester: Link please
[1:03:43] stillsuitstk: Chat, i don't want to be that guy, but p2 is Waist and Feet runes only
[1:03:44] Peoplewhinetoomuch: I doubt we will get all these runes in phase 2
[1:03:44] xNotorietyx: @skwumberton go to wowhead

[1:04:09] NotASkiller: I hope all of this gets scrapped, taken down, and redirected to retail.
[1:04:09] Exusprime: some are fake 2 are over lvl40 abilities
[1:04:10] justingatlin: @ThisGuyisLocal u will get humiliated because ur a weak  loser SeemsGood
[1:04:10] Curtsy: We have no idea which ones are actually making it into the game, literally no point in beign excited
[1:04:11] mrwaddles22: start lvling a pally
[1:04:11] SirKalikan: too many Ws. gonna be interested what makes it and what doesn't.
[1:04:11] Okiswan: L for going against them in pvp
[1:04:11] floetry7: Insane w
[1:04:13] hofners: yeah i may level one
[1:04:15] leechko: nope - you add the 18% crit + melee % crit with the helm rune
[1:04:15] johnnoski: shockadin is viable
[1:04:16] Mico027: glad I leveled a paladin, sounds fun
[1:04:17] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: can tell lead developer is a pala
[1:04:17] dramajohns: but how do you get crit
[1:04:18] Badbotqt: time to level a pally 1-25 rq
[1:04:21] LegendOfKilla: hunter Pog
[1:04:23] inspect4: cant see any hpala player hating on shockadin
[1:04:23] leechko: so near 50% crit
[1:04:24] Mahca_: helm and bracers not this phase so all that could change easily
[1:04:26] xNotorietyx: Melee HUNTER BIS
[1:04:27] j6simracing: Hammer of Wrath rune but not trainable till 44???
[1:04:28] magrausla: Is the music weird_
[1:04:29] magrausla: ?
[1:04:34] ThisGuyisLocal: @justingatlin weak take, we'll call you weakadin
[1:04:36] Curtsy: @chickenarmsandlegs he's a caster but not pally
[1:04:37] Mico027: infinite mana
[1:04:40] PauldcUK: I'm only interested in Shadow Priest lol
[1:04:44] Exusprime: @j6simracing exactly, only a few people are noticing
[1:04:50] dreamreamer: MANA REGEN IS HUGE
[1:04:58] fr03doc: L for being a paladin
[1:04:59] dreamreamer: IM FUCKING OOM ALL THE TIME ON PALY, SHAMAN AND HUNTER LOL
[1:05:05] j6simracing: Also Pally only has 2 Bracer Runes... everybody else has 3 or more
[1:05:11] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @Exusprime same for druid barkskin
[1:05:13] exxxtended: Are they going to improve paladin buffs to last longer than 5 mins?
[1:05:16] NotASkiller: classic andys thinking this is a "w" when it's already in retail yet trash it. L classic andys
[1:05:17] skrothO: @j6simracing leak shows runes on belt, boots, bracers & head... we won't get all 4 slots in Phase 2
[1:05:18] serverfirst300003: yes but things like that bring us closer to retail version of the game
[1:05:18] Mico027: its good for long fight but useless on short fights
[1:05:28] Curtsy: @j6simracing They said that not all of these runes are actually making it into the game
[1:05:30] pandemanium_tv: it's even better though because we are scaling so much harder with current runes
[1:05:35] shadowthehedgehog97: @NotASkiller maybe theres more to retail being the game it is than 1 paladin ability XD
[1:05:35] TBAGodzilla: ResidentSleeper
[1:05:37] pandemanium_tv: so more damage baseline
[1:05:39] xNotorietyx: melele hunter
[1:05:43] Ranthyr_: To be fair anything that reduces hunter damage is a good thing @Xaryu
[1:05:44] xNotorietyx: add flanking strike + those runes
[1:05:44] justingatlin: @ThisGuyisLocal u know u already done so just stop talking its ok my little weak man SeemsGood
[1:05:46] Roaming_Radiance: I LOVE non meta/ typical play styles  like SHockadins and the OLD SCHOOL Spell rogues. Thinking outside the box and making it work is so much FUN and exciting even when it's way harder.
[1:05:47] Macroxx_Rc: DEEP FREEZE
[1:05:48] Exusprime: @Exusprime and holy wrath is lvl50 rank1
[1:05:49] marvinmc420: Lets farken goooo
[1:05:50] Str4nge_DejaVu: Mongoose only after dodge
[1:05:51] marvinmc420: melee hunter inc
[1:05:52] nodnarB_: mongoose does like negative damage LUL
[1:06:05] heavenscloudlol: Changes raptor from heroic strike to mortal strike
[1:06:06] kamuriz: no problem, all the hunter gear has str and alot of mp5 on it, including the worst trinket/classweapon of all the classes @xaryu
[1:06:07] magrausla: Expose Weakness is CRAZY, because you can aready get almost 30% crit chance in SoD
[1:06:10] highkingkevin: they use mana that sucks for melee
[1:06:10] j6simracing: I only REALLY pally main so I noticed that stuff was out of order. Maybe spells will get new level requirements..
[1:06:13] RudyRube: hunter with the dual fist wep NUTTY
[1:06:15] Getz31: Not in gcd you can flanking auto and mangoust and raptor now?
[1:06:15] Zahnstocherzimtstern: steady shoot is 3 sec, bis weapon for hunter is 2.9 PogO
[1:06:20] skrothO: COPIUM people will want to play melee hunters
[1:06:22] TBAGodzilla: who the fuck asked for a fucking melee hunter
[1:06:24] justingatlin: @ThisGuyisLocal if u wanna still talk u can tell me your server so i can find you
[1:06:31] pandemanium_tv: +30% too if they are same weapon? so +80% wow
[1:06:31] RudyRube: @TBAGodzilla me

[1:07:57] Sp00kedEu: ranged shiv
[1:07:57] ajchimica: depends if steady shot and chimera shot share a cd, MM online if they don't or we just run expose weakness
[1:07:59] pandemanium_tv: fucking shadowstep? oh god

[1:10:05] Vunoka: 5 min pala buffs
[1:10:05] Tdoh__: they need to add two handers for rogues

[1:10:09] woiyar: before the timer
[1:10:19] jojoshambho: they need to make it so u can remove ur poisons
[1:10:20] BlackRe3per: deadlybrew
[1:10:21] parmejohn__: they gave them combo points on all
[1:10:22] Nilese: nah, they should make it so you can remove poisons
[1:10:23] Poolhaus: if its 1 hour, they need to be removable
[1:10:23] Woah_Zerk: make battle shout 10 minutes plz
[1:10:30] junction1134: waylay seems ridiculous, 50% slow on ambush and backstab for 8s?!?
[1:10:33] dreamreamer: 5 MIN BUFFS NEED TO BE BANNED LOL
[1:10:36] voltrix07: @xaryu Battleshout for warr would be nice
[1:10:37] ErkTheMighty: did shamans get a rune for their weapon enchants? lol
[1:10:40] zZSaintZz: but sometimes you want to drop poison for windfury, so you would need to make it so you can remove poison
[1:10:41] foresterny: i mean we didnt really need to apply them bc of db but poisons will do nothing in gnomer
[1:10:43] SlapdickWoWplayer: 2 min battle shout needs to be increased man
[1:10:43] Ferrok: they should make it so you can remove poisons from weapons with right click
[1:10:45] TheEnculathor: you cant remove poison so cant benefit from windfury for 30 min if you have poison on
[1:10:47] Genghjs: No shaman buff duration increase :'(
[1:10:54] dreamreamer: FUCK REALLY
[1:10:55] magrausla: @hamsti we don't know which runes will actually be in the game though
[1:10:55] hairfair88: @magrausla I'm against turning every class into a hybrid though. We got several of them already. But that's just my philosophy.
[1:10:57] Dman2848: helm runes are likely next phase
[1:10:57] Roaming_Radiance: Rogue has mad sustain now

[1:11:24] zZSaintZz: nerf everything but my class
[1:11:25] aaskqt: did you review mage yet ?
[1:11:26] automatixxxx: Tank rogue needs more help imp
[1:11:26] inspect4: shadowstep and cloak at 60 ez life
[1:11:27] Reaperz_kinetic: @theenculathor only if you have poison on your main hand you can still have it on your offhand
[1:11:27] SleeplezzViking: Combat rog or sub/ass rog
[1:11:32] LegendOfKilla: priest Pog

[1:11:55] dreamreamer: thank fuck
[1:11:57] M0rley_: its a mana waste
[1:11:58] SleeplezzViking: Combat throw knife - ass/sub shadowstep
[1:11:59] xNotorietyx: same with druid
[1:12:04] ChairsHaveFeelings: @Xaryu I doubt shadowstep will make it into P2 or P3 since theres already shadowstrike on the gloves...
[1:12:07] pproffit: renew is so many inefficient
[1:12:16] dramajohns: priest stack inc
[1:12:19] inhaledthc: phase 2 hype
[1:12:22] copper_cloud: Pikaboo will never play SoD lol. between runnig around on 60% mount for 5 months or dragon riding, I think we know which he prefers
[1:12:23] stillsuitstk: Mind Spike is massive L because of Mind Flay
[1:12:23] Reaperz_kinetic: @chairshavefeelings true but shadowstrike is awful
[1:12:29] bsmoke901: lol dispersion or pain sup
[1:12:30] Tdoh__: @ChairsHaveFeelings the problem with shadow strike is it breaks you out of stealth so you cant open with a stun lol
[1:12:32] bsmoke901: shadow with pain sup
[1:12:33] bsmoke901: OP
[1:12:35] M0rley_: I would have liked to have seen rapture
[1:12:36] thevirginwizard: phase 2 hype
[1:12:37] ChairsHaveFeelings: @Reaperz_kinetic extremely awful lol, I only use it on Baron
[1:12:38] TheEnculathor: @Reaperz_kinetic yes ofc but you got the point, if no windfury i apply sharp stone and its still the same as poison
[1:12:42] RudyRube: DISPERSION POG

[1:12:53] jojoshambho: excited for dispursion
[1:12:54] TurdBurgison: @stillsuitstk not if its instant cast
[1:12:54] acaciashrub: @xaryu mind spike is a bad idea, why make it LESS incentive to use spriest most iconic ability (mind flay) when it was worse than wanding for all of p1
[1:12:54] Jubilation12: nah that aint coming
[1:12:58] Vesir_1: if Spirit of the Redeemer doesn't kill you after you use it, that's amazing for pvp healing.. just become immune for 30 seconds
[1:13:01] stillsuitstk: 'all priests' have dispersion
[1:13:02] prfssrzaddy: Retail 2
[1:13:03] dreamreamer: hellya dude

[1:13:16] serverfirst300003: lol thats like Dragonflight spell
[1:13:17] DumbledorSoD: its runes so any spec can run them all i guess
[1:13:17] calebito_: more and more theyre just weening classic players back on to retail

[1:13:28] serverfirst300003: they literally just gave it to priests in retail not too far ago
[1:13:29] renebabeCoC: requires the talent point
[1:13:30] PepilepsyTTV: everybody is just going to die so fast, pvp isnt even going to be reactionary
[1:13:31] jiggy9: makes spirit of redemption talent actually worth it?
[1:13:33] magrausla: @hairfair88 but Hunter is already a hybrid, it's only that their melee is pretty weak (and you can't shoot in melee range). So being able to be a good range and good melee is what they should be
[1:13:34] Mellion: People saying retail 2.0 don't realise this is more like wrath/cata
[1:13:35] dreamreamer: SOD is not retail chill out
[1:13:35] zerozuckerl: @naela1989 bye

[1:13:46] automatixxxx: binding heal?
[1:13:47] soothingmistmonk: They banned gdkps?
[1:13:49] davisjones_: naela1989 bye, wont be missed
[1:13:52] Woah_Zerk: Bracers are for lvl 50 I'm pretty sure

[1:17:26] anfractuous17: can apply it to another target
[1:17:26] Vesir_1: its reverse salvation

[1:17:36] xProloli: beta boy rune
[1:17:36] abruptdecayO_O: you give it a tank so you can dps and not rip
[1:17:36] zugmadonk: Yes but only to have it on a different gear slot to use other runes
[1:17:37] naturalduck: put it on the healer KEKW
[1:17:37] NutterCircus: lvl 40 threat is alot for sham
[1:17:38] yurchelioz: @Woah_Zerk NS compared to holy paladin shock spam with crazy crit chance is a joke
[1:17:39] paralaxbg: rockbiter generates too much - thats why they add this - so other shamans dont pull threat
[1:17:39] hamsti: troll someone in your group
[1:17:39] joestopfarmingshako: With shield they will need it tbh

[1:17:44] BujuArena: it's to offset the lack of blessing of salvation
[1:17:46] OtherguyTTV: @Mahca_ thats the biggest rune for pvp shaman
[1:17:46] Xzanelol: Decoy totem looks fun
[1:17:47] pattyp1101: grief shadow priests with it
[1:17:48] pilot_wk: it moved the threat gen rune to a different armor piece
[1:17:50] Qeevdo: Shamans do steal threat really easily now however
[1:17:50] trmonx: ohh salv equivalent nice
[1:17:52] gutshotx: @xaryu can you swap the rune off once you've cast it?
[1:17:52] feefo12: maybe for rogue/warlock who knows

[1:31:19] zyydron: I see no problems with this thesis
[1:31:24] Badbotqt: they got better because they added extras to outweigh the loss of DF

[1:45:15] Deomas11: Do you think the increase in player power is too much? I see this going the way of retail/wotlk, especially with the xp boost trivializing levelling which is not really staying true to classic where the journey is also part of the game.

[1:50:24] layzerbandit: they should be able to use the items they gather as like a onuse item of some sort?
[1:50:24] RocketDBoss: rogue over mage?

[1:50:34] Longtimer49: yes
[1:50:34] Krex0r: Making gathering professions buff would increase the number of people to get these profs and would decrease the price of gathered items
[1:50:37] yolo_brah: no i think thats a choice u make
[1:50:38] Badabooker: stam mining

[1:50:54] Mahca_: maybe they’ll do something p3 since they talked about professions for then?
[1:50:57] thebookeu: blacksmithing helm is insane for pvp paladin
[1:50:59] everybodydance8: counterpoint: gathering profs are for moneymaking not min-maxing
[1:51:00] yolo_brah: no having gold from gathering is a choice
[1:51:02] lpxzx: so maybe with mining etc you can get the new mates
[1:51:02] berserage95: give everyone something so everyone feels equal = reetail pls stop
[1:51:04] copterskates: COPIUM
[1:51:07] n_hyun_s: doubt
[1:51:14] 000000000Machea96: Make stuff like mining and gathering not take profession slots like how fishing is

[1:53:40] Varjant: shockadin axe
[1:53:41] endz0r: @Xaryu the one thing I am scarred about is the pacing of combat, with the new runes comes the increase of dmg and healing, and looking at alot of the items Stam seems to be really scarce, I just fear the combat gonna be super bursty and only gonna get more bursty with each phase
[1:53:41] dumpringz: pvp rewards are better than gnomer gear for melee
[1:53:42] shadowthehedgehog97: looks like bfd is still on the menu

[1:54:03] bubs1: 69 attack power, nice
[1:54:09] HippieHopping: so the staff is worse then the one from bfd?
[1:54:09] batchestspam: maybe this feral mace will actually drop for me
[1:54:09] Dman2848: warriors will get an epic 1h mace
[1:54:11] dramajohns: still bis dps. for mage 1h + offhand better prob for pvp
[1:54:13] Jay667b: @magrausla can try changing video quality, i get that sometimes
