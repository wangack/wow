[2:32:23] waitimdesyncd: @lucksh20  But bro the money they save from the lan is used on the prize pool. Youre not really giving any new info
[2:32:27] bmanflex: do you know if eu is fine?

[2:33:38] Dreamy2k3: @muneplays Thank you LOL<3
[2:33:47] muneplays: @Dreamy2k3 <3
[2:33:49] lucksh20: @waitimdesyncd bro.. when they had LAN before, the prizepool was similar to what is it now..its not that they dont have money..they are just greedy. They can easily do cosmetic sells for Prize Pool but we all know how that went last time they did one...LUL
[2:33:50] stingypetrov_oo: @Whaazz  who are u queing with?.
[2:33:52] Dreamy2k3: @muneplays insane u weanted to help spending time to fiond that

[2:34:48] Dreamy2k3: @muneplays hey Oscar can u show the audience ur addons?
[2:34:49] waitimdesyncd: @lucksh20  Again, youre not really giving us any new info that we havent already said 1000 times over  the last month. Again, they rotate the ping disadvantage, and of course Lan would solve it, you dont think we know that. Just watch it or dont
[2:34:51] stonedboodah: @lucksh20 how many years ago? bro you cant expect blizzard to get behind 8 teams for a full lan. ahve a prize pool. pay caster. sell out the event and still make money with a WoW lan. bro it aint happening in 2024 as much as we all want it
