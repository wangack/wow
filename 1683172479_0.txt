[0:57:11] Aervyper: @Towelliee but what do you do?  RBG pre loot and that's what you go into mythic with?
[0:57:16] Thoreya: BDGG are actually doin real well
[0:57:41] Aervyper: RBG i mean  3v3 PVP compitition  pre loot
[0:57:46] xendros78: all the ad breaks don't help either, the first couple days those channels were unwatchable
[0:57:50] Thirn94: Thirn94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[0:57:52] Alsparq: yeah bdgg look great
[0:58:03] xendros78: they finally toned it down once the progging started
[0:58:07] Zettabyte: @Aervyper Had me confused for a sec, thought you wrote RGB KEKW
[0:58:52] Aervyper: @Towellieeand besides commercials everyone has casters saying NOTHING other than Liquid  max's pov that's what people want to see is Max's POV
[0:58:55] BoezIRL: he dinged lol
[0:58:58] Aidler: yeah, I also turned out at some point…. and Liquid advertising for Coinbase… kek… just another FTX
[0:59:13] REALPolarbeezy: the knockback is the wall LUL
[0:59:23] Thoreya: method was a real let down
[0:59:25] Thoreya: this tier
[0:59:44] stabzmcgeee: i was really hoping this was the tier that BDGG stepped up unto the stage for 1st place
[0:59:46] citrinesoan: yeah, true the people play wow and quit are few in numbers.
[0:59:49] kahunahhh: method was pretty wounded with all the controversy
[0:59:57] Aidler: method is where they were last time
[1:00:06] xendros78: even after boss kills sloot still looked miserable LUL
[1:00:13] Aervyper: @Towelliee i remember back in Dragon Soul raid when WF guilds cheated to get Raid finder loot like......
[1:00:57] Thoreya: i feel like sloots been enjoiny it
[1:00:58] Thoreya: idk
[1:01:09] xendros78: LUL
[1:01:12] Alsparq: method did a lot of extrra splits but it didnt help

[1:03:05] tee_rekts: tee_rekts subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[1:03:39] Alsparq: most guilds pay the players a lot of gold to run splits and pass gear
[1:03:50] HairyAreolaus: It should be a thing.
[1:04:30] Forteskir: Not on paladin? You changed main?
[1:04:39] mavericks312: and thats why the top 3 will most likely always be liquid,echo and method
[1:04:52] Aervyper: @Towelliee i think their Normal raid splits that had 18 pugs per split (18 might be wrong) but that's still wildly impressive

[1:06:34] Aervyper: @Towelliee method isn't method they lost almost all that was method it's not even fair to call them method.  Props to Sco for rebuilding that guild
[1:06:39] abracka_: the difference between the echo channel viewers and liquid is nuts. feels like mostly everyone is just watching max instead of liquids channel
[1:06:44] Incredible_Sausage: the tamas update tracks the primals, that's handy
[1:07:11] Alsparq: liquid channel is like half the viewership as maximus personal chanel
[1:07:22] mavericks312: idk if this dies today

[5:34:34] Seetah: Echo has better casters is why
[5:34:38] EvilMalek: they have a good production and commentary
[5:34:39] estebanstrangiato: liquid has been starting at 11am pacific
[5:34:41] CloudPants8081: atpMurray
[5:34:50] im_capy: Both Echo and Liquid have such different ways to approach the raid, and its cool to see both being successful
[5:34:50] mrz_as: gachiHYPER
[5:34:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those splits and mythic+ runs were not great to watch, but them actually working on the mythic raid is awesome to see
[5:34:57] sphynx_rayne: LUL
[5:34:57] devoted_bee: xtraChad
[5:35:04] LX2_EXE: lol
[5:35:15] OmgItsEdizzle: they by far have the better casters isc why...preach, dratnos, and tettles are the big time ones and who got them all
[5:35:30] OmgItsEdizzle: echo got them all
[5:35:30] mrz_as: YEP
[5:35:57] im_capy: Echo even dealt with the Rich drama without a hitch
[5:36:00] xmedpakx: Do you feel this raid is too easy given in a few week people will be sitting easy at 410 plus Ilevel?
[5:36:12] OmgItsEdizzle: have you watched liquid channel? it's painful at times
[5:36:12] mixieg: Been watching echo streams since they aren’t  muted 90% of the time
[5:36:29] Jeuffrey: they cant / dont want it to drag to xmas imho, thats why its maybe a teeny tiny big undertuned, "killable"
[5:36:37] im_capy: facts, as it should be. But you know how business can be
[5:37:13] duhworks: I think splits were easier in this tier the any other they got to 400Ilvl in like 2-3 days of splits versus a week of splits
[5:37:32] HouseofCraftersOfficial: Hey Toelliee and chat!!
[5:37:39] estebanstrangiato: if they can get this far before reset the boss wont last til wednesday
[5:37:46] Masqerader: blizzard is ricky bobby, if u ain't first ur last
[5:38:03] dutchie76: Hey rob
[5:38:11] ItsMorecowbell: My vacation is this Thursday through Jan 2nd WOOT
[5:38:16] Jeuffrey: it should ideally fall later today, before weekly reset
[5:38:28] CarrKinn: That is their own fault though
[5:38:30] Seetah: They need to do something then because they are both in the same place right now and I dont see a way past it they are both on the 5th pushback and its a soft enrage
[5:38:35] Austei: Blizz like "wrap it up"
[5:38:40] JustTrim: prob got a skeleton crew to monitor and tune the raid til 23rd
[5:38:50] JFeezy__: nah, its not a skill thing. Its a gear thing. Overlapping abilities are smashing their health.

[5:39:00] cyrex172: so im playing WOD for the first time and everybody hated Garrisons right?
[5:39:03] Clicklesly: It will be pretty awkward if it gets killed in NA after reset before EU has it
[5:39:12] im_capy: Marketing has a big say on the release dates, maximizing profits
[5:39:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: The devs always want more time
[5:39:15] FaridR9X: !drops
[5:39:17] cyrex172: why did everybody hate garrisons so much
[5:39:25] ObsidianHealer: Any dev would say a game needs more time. No matter the studio.
[5:39:27] DevilSpire: Ya Its nice to be off on Monday this year
[5:39:37] JustTrim: @cyrex172 only because they were so unstable when they launched, took weeks to get them sorted out, you'd get stuck in there and not be able to play, or *have* to go there, and not be able to etc

[5:42:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it depends on if Liquid can come up with a badass comp/strat to start breaking through
[5:42:32] estebanstrangiato: the'll be fine with one more mythic lock

[5:42:38] Jeuffrey: problem with new year is the possible amount of refunds and backlash by delaying it... again--- just like SL - preorders said "before end of 2022"

[5:44:44] Ghunthor: in my opinion
[5:44:54] dutchie76: very low
[5:44:54] shockwave_db: Ruby Death Pools or Ruby wipe pools is fun. We did a 15 and it was awful @towelliee
[5:45:06] thatguynamedjans: My favorite affix was definitely S3 shadowlands with the three mobs and the choice you get to make
[5:45:18] MeisterPetze: DF is a total chill expension... i love it
[5:45:26] jumpered: same, no preasure i just log in and have casual fun in the world
[5:45:30] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: tell me about it
[5:45:39] dutchie76: very very alt friendly too imo
[5:45:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I didn't even play alts like I wanted to when we had to craft legendaries, too much hassle, yeah
[5:45:45] MVRD: DF is freaking bomb
[5:45:47] Arocian: unfort for ppl who like the grind

[5:45:56] Lil_Lexi: it’s so nice compared to shadowlands and bfa
[5:45:58] thatguynamedjans: I hate that other poeple get to control my buff. Like I have the buff, I have big CDs, and someone runs into me immediately
[5:45:59] Molvonos: I mean it was tested -- that's why they kept changing it.  They just made an equally shitty version that went live.

[5:46:19] MistaHat: IDK why theres a seasonal affix any way. Didnt want to get away with that when they went with a rotating schedule for mythic plus?

[5:47:12] PadidinJones: @Towelliee basically ChatGPT is a new chat bot to answer questions and can even write essays.
[5:47:23] citrinesoan: christmas lights are exciting this year and they are in WoW as well, and like this beautiful nativity scene... but like i dont want to mention spiritual stuff.
[5:47:28] MFAM_THE_Steven: Ya i hate when they run to me as soon as i get the buff
[5:47:29] dutchie76: grevious and bursting tomorrow too with tyrannical
[5:47:30] rivera9: i try to find someone to get buff off asap, b/c of QUAKIN bullshit
[5:47:33] abracka_: change it so clearing it provides the damage buff, not clearing it causes the stun/damage
[5:47:40] Annavida: may as well get rid of it
[5:47:46] Aidler: @padidinjones and it can code
[5:47:51] mavericks312: just get gud lol
[5:48:19] Goll15900: I’ve was bagging last night and almost every last boss I was the last one alive soloing the boss
[5:48:33] abracka_: you tell people in the group before the dungeon starts, "retain the debuff until 4-5 seconds then clear it, so you can max the damage buff" and nobody listens
[5:48:39] xmedpakx: its super exciting with quaking lets be honest!  amirite?
[5:48:52] brewgamingtv: Yeah it’s rough in pugs
[5:48:59] mavericks312: still better then prideful
[5:49:06] Keglett: there's so much shit on the ground in these dungeons that'll 1 shot in in higher keys and I'd rather have one less thing to worry about especially with quaking personally
[5:49:06] Hipperz: I thought Prideful was way worse
[5:49:07] thorined: i think its fine
[5:49:11] shockwave_db: I think I’ve only been stunned 3 times so far. Having that stupid weak aura that blinks X or Square makes it easy
[5:49:16] brewgamingtv: Prideful wasn’t bad
[5:49:16] Molvonos: Prideful was awesome
[5:49:19] thorined: honestly they should make it the buff stays even after you clear it
[5:49:19] raldrik: I think they released it way to late into testing and didnt get enough feedback before having to push it live
[5:49:22] OldManMitch: Dungeon timing is rough too
[5:49:23] Snabido: Prideful only bad if it took too long to kill it imo
[5:49:24] mavericks312: prideful was top tier trash
[5:49:27] brewgamingtv: You could control when it spawned
[5:49:32] Molvonos: Thundering + Quaking or any other affix combo feels bad.
[5:49:35] Hipperz: If you botches a prideful, you just straight up couldn't finish some fights though
[5:49:39] dutchie76: wayyy to much aoe dmg going on in these dungeons too
[5:49:43] Hipperz: botched*
[5:49:43] shockwave_db: Shrouded was the best
[5:49:44] snake_like: as a tank prideful was stressful as shit
[5:49:55] JFeezy__: made anyone that i run keys with get a thundering weak aura. not perfect but helps.

[5:50:44] Alsparq: bdgg has the double ring CLEAN!
[5:50:48] OmgItsEdizzle: if I'm on boss and thundering time hits less than 5 sec I insta-pop shield wall
[5:51:04] citrinesoan: bleedPurple
[5:51:05] thorined: maybe lower the duration but make the buff stay after you clear it
[5:51:29] CardinalTX: its not?
