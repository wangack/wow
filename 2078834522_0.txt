[4:25:33] Genghish: Dont you get bored of playing rogue over and over again?
[4:25:34] artist_i: they give you "new game" every time and you still complain
[4:25:34] Arrwstos87: the reason i cant play retail, the endless pursuit of better gear and the previous gear is useless
[4:25:50] wardelswijk: O.o, isnt sod like a new phase every 3 months?
[4:25:55] demonzhunter: and a million upgrade tokens
[4:25:55] StreamElements: RULES: 1) No backseat gaming. I will do whatever I feel like doing. 2) Be nice.
[4:25:57] wardelswijk: and u have to refarm gear
[4:25:57] chadbingles: i think devs forget how sentimental ppl are and that we want memories
[4:26:01] demonzhunter: theyve gone OTT
[4:26:03] newkingcody: @PsheroTV what were you doing on retail before classic in 2019?
[4:26:08] demonzhunter: which is not fun

[4:28:58] Eyvaann: designed around class fantasy?
[4:28:59] tacodoc: Classic is the best for class identity
[4:29:00] skyestormz: retail is at a point where they may as well just make you max lvl from the start. it’s not an mmo so lvling is pointless

[8:54:12] I_Am_Fletch: KEKW
[8:54:19] ye1l: @vejitas4 dreamstate which he has is by far the most important buff
[8:54:22] 101stAirborne12b: That mage is doing horrible damage

[8:55:08] Phonomaniabg: Shadow priest , warrior and you expose whats wrong with your group
[8:55:12] 101stAirborne12b: i do 247 on last boss
[8:55:13] kazaii626: enough to make chat stfu
[8:55:13] ritter184: mouse over your gear for a quick second
[8:55:16] OldManAngelo: a 95% is 285
[8:55:16] VeganBootySweat: ~280-300
[8:55:18] The_palumbo: without wildstrikes, probably close to 250 max
[8:55:23] blaze_it_Tyrone: You had no wind Fury
[8:55:28] bassiemon123: @phonomaniabg explain
[8:55:34] Team_Apple_Juice: with windfury at least 300
[8:55:43] zazaenjoya: windfury
[8:55:44] I_Am_Fletch: windfury given from feral
[8:55:46] MeiTricide: wild strikes is druid wf
[8:55:51] hsayus123: windfury feral
[8:55:55] StreamElements: RULES: 1) No backseat gaming. I will do whatever I feel like doing. 2) Be nice.
[8:55:57] ye1l: with your gear like 250+ without wb
[8:55:59] Aitor229: no same
[8:56:00] zazaenjoya: 4Shrug same
[8:56:02] blaze_it_Tyrone: Yes
[8:56:04] VeganBootySweat: dismantle gives me 25-30dps on this fight
[8:56:04] AzoreanLegend: woulkd say yes
[8:56:04] MeiTricide: i think so?
[8:56:04] I_Am_Fletch: slightly
[8:56:10] The_palumbo: i usually get 300 dps first phase, and it normalizes down around 200 dps with no windfury
[8:56:12] ritter184: they arent the same, depends on your gear
[8:56:12] I_Am_Fletch: gives more AP
[8:56:21] ritter184: the flap AP might be higher if your gear is low
[8:56:22] bassiemon123: Wf is better if the shaman got the improved totem talents
[8:56:27] AzoreanLegend: yes
[8:56:28] OldManAngelo: renew bounce
[8:56:30] ye1l: it's very similar
[8:56:32] AzoreanLegend: each time you are healed it bounces so yeah
[8:56:36] tacodoc: All out buffs and consumes you could do about 500 i think?
[8:56:38] MeiTricide: WF is just a chance for 2nd attack but WS gives 2nd attack+20% AP i think? im ally tho so no idea how wf itself works
[8:56:49] bassiemon123: Wrong
[8:56:53] bassiemon123: Wf does give ap
[8:56:53] Phonomaniabg: @bassiemon123 what to explain , if he isnt speced improve expose its reduce less armor then sunders and homunculus, so he waste CP when he can envenom and slice only
[8:56:57] ye1l: @tacodoc not on last boss, rank 1 is 379 lol
[8:57:12] MeiTricide: @bassiemon123 cool
[8:57:12] blaze_it_Tyrone: Wf totem flat att Peer buff
[8:57:15] I_Am_Fletch: WF gives a flat increase to AP whilst Wild Strikes gives a %AP increase
[8:57:30] I_Am_Fletch: so with bad gear shaman windfury is better
[8:57:39] I_Am_Fletch: wildstrikes is better with good gear
[8:57:52] Phonomaniabg: just ask Hydra for homunculus or 1 of the other priest
