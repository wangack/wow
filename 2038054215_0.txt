[3:26:28] TheVaroon: different octave but same notes, no?
[3:26:33] Puddit: He wasn't copying the note. Like two octaves up and out of tune
[3:26:41] vaetuu: @TheVaroon ??
[3:26:48] AdamAlgae: Do you think the epic xbow would be better for pvp than the agi gun?
[3:26:51] Puddit: Yeah but still not in tune
[3:26:57] Puddit: you are correct
[3:27:20] Puddit: well I do know lol

[3:27:35] madgerofl: @TheVaroon xD
[3:27:48] Puddit: He must be a real hit with the chicks
[3:28:01] Puddit: Perfect pitch is different
[3:28:11] itsWANDAI: Relative pitch is pretty common and something you can practice
[3:28:11] Lucons1: its not perfect if u have to learn it
[3:28:26] madgerofl: Learning music in general very interresting but way too hard
[3:28:28] Puddit: Perfect pitch is hearing a random note and being able to say "that's a C or thats and F"
[3:28:32] AdamAlgae: Perfect pitch is more about knowing what the note is. Not everyone can recreate it
[3:28:40] DjStingray: yeah there are little kids who can identify not only notes but entire chords by ear
[3:28:42] Puddit: but being able to tell whether one note is just an octave up is something most can do
[3:28:48] madgerofl: F
[3:28:51] body_type_two: my mom know that
[3:28:58] body_type_two: she was a proffesor

[6:05:36] Sewoemio: i never get board of board games Keepo
[6:05:40] LillaJeon: Man Twitch is kinda unleashed when you think about it. Roughly $13 and you skip all youtube ads no matter who you watch for a month. On twitch it's half that price limited to one channel DansGame
[6:05:40] StevenHawkes: nah.. the social aspect still remains a thing
[6:06:01] Gloorius: did you play everdale?
[6:06:03] SourEnjoyer: expensive cats is a funny board game

[6:06:19] paganlzer: gloomhaven is really one of the best games ever made
[6:06:21] Bootch: @Sewoemio I also enjoy risk alot Peepi
[6:06:22] Somanie: @LillaJeon Twitch Turbo eliminates ads for all Twitch channels but idk how much it runs per month
[6:06:27] Wickk77: quacks of quedlinburg is cool as well
[6:06:29] Amprafel: explosive kittens is awesome
[6:06:32] Bootch: D:
[6:06:45] Bootch: buy armies, get territories, its world domination
[6:06:46] Sewoemio: conquer the world
[6:06:48] LillaJeon: @Somanie Hold up, really? I never knew that. I guess my point is kinda invalid then LUL
[6:06:58] Amprafel: you gotta RISK IT
[6:06:58] moxjuul: id like to play risk someday, but i'm afraid to take a chance
[6:07:00] Wickk77: avalon is the best :D
[6:07:03] Somanie: there's a couple that 1v1s each other with various board games and loser has to make dinner lol
[6:07:06] Bootch: yes

[6:07:16] bassiemon123: Correct
[6:07:16] Bootch: nah
[6:07:16] Sewoemio: it's not
[6:07:19] Sewoemio: very easy
[6:07:24] Sewoemio: and very tactical
[6:07:27] fiends_church: not for a rogue genius such as yourself
[6:07:28] bassiemon123: Wait whut
[6:07:35] Sewoemio: a lot of fun to play with freinds
[6:07:37] iCerv: u can play easy or harder
[6:07:48] slaskjohn: its more about manipulating the other players tbh
[6:07:57] kil6tera: no mutilate today?
[6:07:59] Somanie: @LillaJeon yayse!! and I just looked it up, it's $11.99USD per month for Twitch Turbo <3
[6:08:22] LillaJeon: @Somanie Oh damn, so actually an even better deal than youtube haha, whoopsie ;p Thanks XD
[6:08:39] newmanch: this precision is worth it in pvp? even with the hit from pve gear?
[6:08:48] guztawo: endurance
[6:09:21] Nelzgrim: what is the best spec to play with mutilate or backstab please?
[6:09:49] Somanie: depends on your playstyle but I feel like mutilate would be more forgiving? bc you don't have to be behind
[6:10:46] newmanch: how much do you have from gear right now?
[6:11:05] StevenHawkes: isnt that at lvl 60 tho? question not statement
[6:11:25] StreamElements: 🐦 Follow me on Twitter -> https://twitter.com/Psherotv
[6:11:57] bassiemon123: Are u still rocking the 6 agi 2 stam neck?
[6:12:06] Ziqoftw: Ziqoftw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 36 month streak! any prime
[6:12:11] bassiemon123: Noo
[6:12:26] My_keI: you have same chance to hit with both weps when dual wielding
[6:12:36] bassiemon123: heroHYPERS
[6:12:42] Ziqoftw: on dr
[6:12:45] therealEsman: I love this game because it reminds me of LOTR. And when you walk these woods, its like when the elves are going to the Valinor. Such a blessed feeling
[6:12:55] obstata: thats def not true
[6:13:01] My_keI: yes only yellow hits are hit capped when talking about hit capping
[6:13:05] slaskjohn: @therealEsman xd
[6:13:06] Blightstar: Offhand gers penalty to damage
[6:13:13] My_keI: white hit cap is like 28%
[6:13:14] cropdeq: its true

[6:13:52] xTrueEast: well the end of the season will be the reset id assume
[6:14:09] Ziqoftw: I’m rolling on second dagger
[6:14:26] NastyNick925: @PsheroTV what are you thoughts on shadowstrike for PVP?
[6:14:27] therealEsman: And when Pshero goes into stealth its like hes putting on the magic ring
[6:14:36] Blightstar: Also note that unlikely normally, BFD bosses are only +2lvls instead of +3lvls like in lvl60 raids. So you need less hit (and racials matter a bit less)
[6:14:51] peekz123: Is this better than mutil/backstab spec?
[6:14:55] StreamElements: RULES: 1) No backseat gaming. I will do whatever I feel like doing. 2) Be nice.
[6:15:06] xTrueEast: fan of knives would be a cool aoe for us in p2 but im just throwing things out there
[6:15:18] Asza: ye
