[1:32:59] boopbopbamski: but retail is always the same thing for me I join some guild get aotc grind m+ farm gold and tmog / achievements get bored and quit
[1:33:09] MattOriginal: M+ and Raiding are amazing in retail, outside of that, the world feels dead.

[1:47:23] chungus_ult: lmfao smoothbrain
[1:47:25] Garsto: i smell a stream hater
[1:47:26] karrots96: Sonii got a question, outside of buying consumes, what do people feel like they need gold for to stay "caught up" with current content? You can do BFD with gear you get from questing and dungeons
[1:47:28] Garsto: /moo
[1:47:36] benbreezi: you also don’t get given loot most of your runs 🤣
[1:47:39] dankovic27: @waderxz Pepega kid go sleep

[1:48:19] einself111: yeah it will all be gdkps and gold buying soon ... exactly like it happened in tbc and wrath
[1:48:20] xdpulp: i fucking hate gdkps
[1:48:21] Garsto: i despise the concept of gdkp
[1:48:23] limburgse: i dont like gdkp!!
[1:48:25] chungus_ult: I haven't seen that many gdkps
[1:48:26] Dracolich_71: gdkp is cancer
[1:48:27] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: gdkp is so stupid
[1:48:27] jiggeritus: Crusader Strike sucks
[1:48:28] Swayvuh: gdkp has ruined classic imo
[1:48:28] limburgse: its cursed!
[1:48:30] BiggieBoyZ: isnt that just Crusader Strike US/ Living Flame EU problem?
[1:48:35] azzy_dog: Can we keep Hero MS > OS
[1:48:35] andres_1123: they are doing both still sorta
[1:48:36] The_Spicy_: yeah f that
[1:48:36] jiggeritus: its just a Crusader Strike problem
[1:48:40] epidemicttv: \
[1:48:41] Jkorn415: I was looking for a raid on horde and saw 5 gdkp and no regular raids
[1:48:41] jiggeritus: other servers are fine
[1:48:41] Porkypine666: I will never do gdkp in sod thank god I found a good guild
[1:48:42] Ashlikesnows: GDKP ruined this game.
[1:48:43] D3KHAR: GDKP is the speedrunning way of gearing
[1:48:43] savagelo256: GDKPs are on every server lmao what
[1:48:45] Garsto: the concept of gdkp and all of the things that it's evil tentacles touch in game just rots an MMO
[1:48:46] luzid7: you can't do something else at some point because it destroys the economys
[1:48:48] FIREMAGZZ: GDKPS SUCK up all the good players the PUGS have 40 IQ people
[1:48:50] rawlexdota: My Turbochargers business ,went to shit  xD
[1:48:53] steamedmussel25: ive never had to gdkp... just farm for gold and join a guild to raid..
[1:48:53] KhamulESO: dont ppl have guilds and shit they run with?
[1:48:54] Ranzorx: living flame isnt like that
[1:48:54] einself111: fucked

[1:48:58] Halzakk: cause its a streamer server im assuming
[1:48:58] Porkypine666: havent seen a single gdkp on lava lash
[1:48:59] aeth22: its a way bigger problem on crusader strike compared to lone wolf
[1:49:00] jiggeritus: LoneWolf NA i raid fine
[1:49:02] savagelo256: so many on lone wolf
[1:49:03] Jkorn415: and every actual group on crusader strike, all seem to be super bad at bfd
[1:49:06] Porkypine666: o shit i love this song
[1:49:06] limp0h: lone wolf eu, barely any gdkp
[1:49:06] pottyswagfilms: dont see that much on Wild Growth (PVE)
[1:49:06] Greynoise14: Lone wolf isnt like that either
[1:49:09] 5iftyfourth: Lone wolf is poppin i love it, nice economy
[1:49:10] limburgse: gdkp isnt that much on my EU Wildgrowth server, barely a run of it ( AND IM HAPPY! )
[1:49:16] 5iftyfourth: I play horde
[1:49:18] iknowido: they should just get rid of currency completely
[1:49:22] limburgse: no one wants to run them
[1:49:23] steamedmussel25: living flame pvp alliance popin
[1:49:25] Ranzorx: living flame US you get spam reported for advertising gdkp
[1:49:30] karrots96: @iknowido what a take lol
[1:49:34] OxyTxn6: im on lone wolf or I would
[1:49:36] Valmian: I don't have any issues with gold. I'm at 200g (only 2 characters at 25 bis). Things are cheap on living flame.
[1:49:37] JpgImage: Feel like if its the case where its that bad then it shouldnt be too difficult to make your own Sr/ms>os raid no?
[1:49:40] DadRage: hell yea
[1:49:42] DadRage: moving to living flame
[1:49:44] TobyNova: If i join Crusader Strike US and i'm in the UK, do you think it will be awful because of ping?
[1:49:45] novvum: We need to start donig that
[1:49:45] Ranzorx: 100% know people who got banned for it
[1:49:50] jiggeritus: ya we dont like GDKPs on LoneWolf
[1:49:51] Porkypine666: i fully agree with that, gtfo
[1:49:53] bukkye: living flame ally eu all gdkps almost
[1:50:09] Valmian: Valmian subscribed with Prime. 
[1:50:09] BiggieBoyZ: @TobyNova its playable, many r1 eu pvpers plays on na
[1:50:12] ExpectKhaos: apparently GDKP ads are reportable if in LFG channel
[1:50:15] BlownFuse_: gdkps are lame af. and nobody can change my mind
[1:50:15] D3KHAR: It's such a short lockout just run it and hope for the best
[1:50:16] BadGerbilLion: nonSR BFD is ass
[1:50:20] savagelo256: HR is just as cringe as GDKPs tho
[1:50:21] vervecheck: Lonewolf is full of GDKPs
[1:50:23] Halzakk: so is gdkp like gold bidding guys ?

[1:50:36] debbish: soft reserve is fine just the hard reserve is cringe
[1:50:42] Nightbot: GHOST is having a buy one get one 50% off sale on ALL protein powder, use code "SONII" for an additional 20% off!!! ghostlifestyle.com // uk.ghostlifestyle.com
[1:50:49] vervecheck: If people didn't buy gold GDKP would be the best loot system imo
[1:50:51] JpgImage: yeah Im biased. . . now that I need 3 or so more pieces for my war I like sr 2/3
[1:50:52] D3KHAR: Do you think it's wrong for streamers to make gold off of clearly bought gold in GDKPs?
[1:50:56] vervecheck: but because people buy gold it ruins it
[1:50:56] FIREMAGZZ: lol
[1:51:01] Hunt2103: well some people are okay with gdkps so that arguement doesnt really work
[1:51:03] Ehawth: When the reason you find the runs is because you have an online presence? yes.
[1:51:06] jiggeritus: too many gold buyers on Crusader Strike
[1:51:09] Porkypine666: sr and hr are totally fine imo, completely different than gdkp
[1:51:19] savagelo256: SRs are hot, you get what you need most of the time
[1:51:20] bearijuana___: I tank and heal GDKP's to make money. I like having that option other than farming.

[1:51:43] dripppsta: hard reserve og
[1:51:46] Garsto: streamer haters present during a streamers stream just to hate on said streamer is fucking weird energy
[1:51:53] BlownFuse_: I was the loot can confirm
[1:51:57] TobyNova: What about if we call it Boner reserve instead of hard reserve so people don't get as mad?
[1:51:58] DadRage: " I HATE STREAMERS" continues to be on twitch

[1:52:25] Ashlikesnows: LUL haters be hating bro
[1:52:27] CAD604: imagine... getting mad about a group that you have nothing to do with and have the ability to just ignore it :)
[1:52:28] BlownFuse_: praying on your downfall
[1:52:29] D3KHAR: The only person I hatewatch is Savix 4Weird

[1:52:43] karrots96: So GDKP's are literally the projection of a hyper-capitalistic society imposing their philosophy in a game. Meanwhile in EU they ban GDKP's. I actually find that so fascinating. This game is truly built by the community.
[1:52:45] TobyNova: look at Miz i'm sure he embraces it now
[1:52:55] Garsto: same concept as news, or followers, or clicks on a fuckin article - it's the concept of polarization + human emotional flaws/bad habits XD
[1:52:55] imthatjacob: xarTroll
[1:52:59] Sp00kedEu: why would u watch someone u hate even
[1:53:05] znowwwy: got my hands on the epic sword today feels good
[1:53:08] jschroe3: arcane mage
[1:53:29] debbish: @karrots96 if u come to lonewolf eu its only gdkps basically
[1:53:33] savagelo256: @karrots96 they do not ban for GDKPs in EU what the hell
[1:53:43] TobyNova: @Sp00kedEu people are angry inside at their own lives, and want other people to suffer
[1:53:49] draega1989: no
[1:53:51] MattOriginal: lol no
[1:53:52] pipxsqueak: i really dont understand the hate for gdkps, if you dont like them dont join them otherwise you get paid to raid, whats so bad about that
[1:53:52] savagelo256: no
[1:53:54] BiggieBoyZ: not at all
[1:53:55] claynukem: EU is capalist as well...
[1:53:57] vervecheck: No he is lying
[1:53:57] aeth22: nope
[1:53:59] vervecheck: EU loves gdkps
[1:53:59] Moot94: i used to gdkp all day on wotlk on eu
[1:54:03] znowwwy: EU has the worst of the GDKP
[1:54:08] 8thwndrmusic: they promote gold buying
[1:54:09] ItsLadrana: It's kinda wild how people will just speak out of their ass as fact KEKW
[1:54:16] Conditions1: Gdkp Increases Rmt
[1:54:17] vervecheck: People HATE GDKPs because it brings the good players to GDKPS and the pugs suck
[1:54:18] BlownFuse_: it promotes gold buying. exactly
[1:54:19] Porkypine666: lmao gdkps promote botting
[1:54:21] novvum: True
[1:54:22] Porkypine666: fucking DUH
[1:54:22] limburgse: AGREED!
[1:54:23] karrots96: someone made a comment saying people get mass reported for promoting GDKPS in EU
[1:54:23] Valmian: GDKP in a world without gold buying is fine.
[1:54:24] BlownFuse_: gold buying and gdkp go hand in hand
[1:54:29] D3KHAR: The prices are wack
[1:54:31] Conditions1: Most people doing Gdkp's buy gold imo
[1:54:32] znowwwy: its the issue of people buying soo much gold to gear up
[1:54:33] jschroe3: we hate gold buying thats playing into gdkp
[1:54:33] luzid7: yes and people don't see it its the same as bots
[1:54:33] jiggeritus: it incentives gold buying
[1:54:34] claynukem: NO ONE doing gdkp isnt buying gold
[1:54:34] Garsto: i hate that it encourages the buying and selling of gold
[1:54:34] Hunt2103: gdkps would be fine if gold buying wasnt a thing
[1:54:35] Garsto: that's it
[1:54:36] BadGerbilLion: gdkps dont create gold
[1:54:38] jschroe3: not the gdkp themselves
[1:54:42] Ranzorx: gdkp does nothing to the game without gold buying
[1:54:44] The_Spicy_: blue whale in the room
[1:54:44] novvum: Why do u think i made over 400g by 26 on Whitemane Classic Era?
[1:54:45] BerkTheLUL: encourages people to buy gold bro what is there not to understand gdkps are trash and cringe
[1:54:46] xlucas128: good thing bots lead to droping prices
[1:54:52] limp0h: just blame ahmpy lol
[1:54:53] Youtube_Historian: Gold buying tis the problem, GDKP fdoesnt create gold
[1:54:59] vervecheck: Economy would be fucked either way GDKP is just spending gold
[1:55:02] vervecheck: not producing it
[1:55:05] 8thwndrmusic: dropping prices but make it hard to make gold
[1:55:06] Porkypine666: hes making his own gold though?
[1:55:10] Hunt2103: GDKP would be a great idea if gold buying wasnt a thing
[1:55:14] BlownFuse_: gdkp gives a huge incentive to buy gold. so there’s a problem in that
[1:55:14] stars23: Blame the ppl selling the gold for real money
[1:55:22] FIREMAGZZ: You need alot of gold for advanced world pvp in Classic wow
[1:55:24] bodadieda: true
[1:55:38] 8thwndrmusic: They need in ingame currency that cant be traded

[1:55:40] Ehawth: Isnt ahmpy great for this exact thing? he takes inflated gold from people buying power lvls and never spends it
[1:55:40] tyki_tries: if wow just had gold sinks i suppose it wouldnt matter as much
[1:55:43] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[1:55:55] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: is affliction a viable spec in BFD or is destro the way to go
[1:56:01] Hunt2103: destro
[1:56:03] Hunt2103: only
[1:56:05] einself111: @tyki_tries that would change nothing lol
[1:56:07] Valmian: Boons were a sink in HC but now they are 20s a pop
[1:56:07] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: ok
[1:56:07] Youtube_Historian: Theyd never do this but. Turn exp into currency, get rid of gold.
[1:56:12] MattSimmo123: when is phase 2 out?
[1:56:16] karrots96: Gold sinks encourage buying gold more...
[1:56:16] ItsLadrana: they just added new gold sinks in retail this past week. vendor with like 2.2 mil worth of items
[1:56:22] iiMrBlue: do you have videos on your movement key bindings? like how you do that spin with character + camera

[1:57:40] bahsingha: w
[1:57:40] Chaboi_Twill: mount is half since its seasonal
[1:57:40] TobyNova: What is the AH like on Crusader? I kind of like grinding and using the Ah so could pass on some gold for content

[1:57:45] supermaduro24: how do gold farm in season off discovery @sonii

[1:57:48] jschroe3: hoping to full natty farm 200 for mounts
[1:57:50] slaayeri: check the vendors
[1:57:50] BerkTheLUL: SMOrc

[1:58:11] xlucas128: season of mastery mount was cheaper yeah
[1:58:12] D3KHAR: Cooking
[1:58:18] theNizzmo: these people being confidently wrong with mounts is outstanding lol
[1:58:23] xdpulp: so sick
[1:58:23] savagelo256: @sonii when did the gold buying become so normalized? tbc?
[1:58:35] chungus_ult: @savagelo256 lol classic re release
[1:58:36] supermaduro24: how do gold farm in season off discovery sonii
[1:58:38] EvilTermy: rank 6 is max next phase

[1:59:01] limp0h: you guys have money? what
[1:59:03] dershammy: The economy is just fucked because ppl dont play the game how it usually should be. Join a guild, play with them, earn your item. Nowadays everyone whats everything instantly. Thats why GDKP is so popular. i play it much, but casually. i dont give a fck how fast im geared because then i get bored
[1:59:07] MattheusD: season of mastery was about 45g
[1:59:09] savagelo256: @chungus_ult bc no GMs watching bots or what
[1:59:11] Chaboi_Twill: go look at the mount vendors... u can see the prices
[1:59:15] xdpulp: Do you think you will ever level another shaman? It’s fun watching you mess around on a warrior alt and all. And I’m sure the shaman death is still kind of fresh. But it would be tragic to lose a pillar of the shaman community. And as a rsham main I’d miss your gameplay a lot.
[1:59:17] tylerran34: they are giving druids a mount rune
[1:59:18] supermaduro24: @sonii  how you been

[2:01:43] zkakashiz: im pretty sure if you go to mount trainer the prices are already updated
[2:01:44] D3KHAR: 40, 50, 80... Which one is it?

[2:06:46] Kormz__: if they keep making the gear is better in every phase i feel like by the time you get to like zg the peices wont be that much of an upgrade
[2:06:47] Porkypine666: 40 unlocks so many classes and gnomer raid is gonna be sick

[2:10:23] xdpulp: i think they said theres gonna be another way to gain exp thern the normal ways
[2:10:25] epidemicttv: GDKP's are so common likely because raids require every consume imaginable which can be costly to pop them every fight and for trash. Not many people enjoy using their time to farm gold to afford these consumes so they just swipe or attend GDKP's to take swipers gold.
[2:10:26] aeth22: not at launch, questie is cancer

[2:20:02] NawtyTyme: fork hit
[2:20:03] yellowgaiden: i know thats the funny part
[2:20:05] Tangents92: KEKW
[2:20:07] xdpulp: buying from breeders is kinda like a gdkp
[2:20:09] Ashlikesnows: KEKW
[2:20:12] philcoffins13: Bruh don't feed it lol you wanted dog simple
[2:20:14] draega1989: the breeder dogs are going to be born regardless
[2:20:14] ZakjeTV: Not moving away from the group with Forked Lightning on
[2:20:16] NawtyTyme: yep
[2:20:20] nct0: you dont know that
[2:20:20] steamedmussel25: LUL LUL
[2:20:22] Porkypine666: man idk
[2:20:24] Prevention6: some people want a specific breed its ok I think
[2:20:24] draega1989: no
[2:20:26] yellowgaiden: no please dont
[2:20:26] TobyNova: nooooo
[2:20:28] TobyNova: hahaha
[2:20:32] moist_perineum: that's how drug dealers rationalize selling dope no lie
[2:20:41] steamedmussel25: whats the snap?
[2:20:41] chiefslappov3: Do you throw trash on the ground because someone else is going to do it too?
[2:20:42] ntmr_: nah that argument is invalid, but don't get into it

[2:20:49] HeyItsBlumpers: treadmill girl? that shit was funny af
[2:20:53] unfaazed: why shouldnt u buy it from a breeder?
[2:21:09] yellowgaiden: i like getting muts, thats just my personal preference
[2:21:20] Clamsmasher24: Certain breads you can really only get from breeders
[2:21:38] Youtube_Historian: osunds responsible
[2:21:39] ntmr_: as long as you sourced a reputable and legit breeder I don't care. Like breeders aren't all evil, just the dodgy ones
[2:21:42] nickcero: exactly
[2:21:44] barskebaard: bro you dont need to defend your choice
[2:21:49] 5iftyfourth: perfectly understandable
[2:21:50] bastiitho: Is the fathomblade better than smites mighty hammer for warrior?
[2:21:51] unfaazed: sounds logic
[2:21:53] Porkypine666: shouldnt be ashamed of wanting the dog you wanted
[2:21:57] eZPked: I dont think either you need to defend yourself here
[2:22:00] HideLemonsYo: dont let people guilt you into breeders lol theyre proper hypocrits in other ways
[2:22:06] SmokeManMuscle: dogs in pounds get put down
[2:22:08] neon_wow: They want you to buy pitbulls from a shelter
[2:22:09] draega1989: kennel club
[2:22:09] xdpulp: my girlfriend loves breeding!
[2:22:16] Youtube_Historian: Typically they are in rough conditions like puppy mills/
[2:22:17] ZeldaSykes: obliviously one person can’t stop breeders. it’s the fact that there are so many dogs that exist already and need homes
[2:22:18] ntmr_: just the backyard breeders, not registered and abusive. If you went to a proper breeder then no issues
[2:22:21] yellowgaiden: its cuz theres a ton of dogs in shelters allready thats all
[2:22:25] geezyxtv: There are ethical and unethical breeders... Poor people buy from unethical shit breeders... that's what everyone assumes they're ALL like... because they have small brain.
[2:22:26] HeyItsBlumpers: they get mad because not everyone wants a pitbull or a chihuahua from a shelter
[2:22:28] Prevention6: There's a difference between responsible breeders and "puppy mills" which care more about profit then anything else
[2:22:30] TobyNova: I think it's mostly because of how many dogs are in shelters already
[2:22:36] eZPked: I think the thing about the breeding is making dogs a consumable product
[2:22:36] 4F4Monteiro: is ochiba  bottle of wisky what we talking about here
[2:22:40] philcoffins13: Puppy mill is different from a breeder simple
[2:22:41] chiefslappov3: Shelters are packed and you could easily save a dogs life than going to the breeders who are already adding the over-population of dogs

[2:23:04] TobyNova: omg
[2:23:05] jimmyrover8: KEKW
[2:23:14] PurefectionsTTV: what if someone doesn't want that breed? you know they have certain breeds of dogs
[2:23:15] neon_wow: @chiefslappov3 so go get 20 pitbulls from the shelter instead of trying to make other people do it
[2:23:27] Ashlikesnows: that's fucked
[2:23:32] Lukeker: All breeders are unethical cause theres too many dogs without homes/love out there
[2:23:35] chiefslappov3: @neon_wow I do have dogs from the shelter lol
[2:23:39] limburgse: no
[2:23:42] neon_wow: go get 5 more then
[2:23:43] geezyxtv: @Lukeker How many dogs do you have? lol
[2:23:44] SmokeManMuscle: adoptable dogs get put down
[2:23:47] minimusmax_: LOL
[2:23:47] ZeldaSykes: yes overpopulation of dogs
[2:24:01] NawtyTyme: chawawas
[2:24:02] Youtube_Historian: every one of them
[2:24:04] SmokeManMuscle: i would adopt more dogs if my wife allowed it
[2:24:05] limburgse: only 5?
[2:24:07] Delphex: So is that the same about humans aswell?
[2:24:07] yellowgaiden: its not really, if you want a certain breed, go get that breed, but if you just want a dog, get one from the shelter
[2:24:09] holdmybeerkid: if i could be a stay at home dog dad i would
[2:24:10] xdpulp: wouldnt that kinda be like you cant have kids because there is kids that need to be adopted?
[2:24:11] ntmr_: I rescued both of my dogs, they both came from abusive/neglected situations and were very traumatized for the first year of their time with me. But now they're the happiest dogs ever :)
[2:24:12] TobyNova: tbh the world is fucked anyway so it doesn't really matter
[2:24:15] laugeelias123: tbf if you treat your dog well isnt that all you can do to be a good dog owner you cant control other people
[2:24:21] MissMeowster: my 3 cats were all rescues soniiAww soniiAww
[2:24:21] Flitzpipm: my dad is a musher and has breed Siberian husky´s. He won really much with his dogs. He sell purebreed dogs family tree, vaccinations, he has his chip,  and yea its like u say. there a good breeder and bad. most do it for money..
[2:24:24] ZeldaSykes: I’ve rescued a pregnant pitbull from the street. someone abandoned her so sad
[2:24:24] einself111: also adopt some kids from africa
[2:24:25] Djbunny162: Thats like saying its unethical to have kids because there are so many orphans out there.
[2:24:31] PurefectionsTTV: yeah why have your own kid when you can adopt? smh these people
[2:24:32] geezyxtv: "Oh I can't because my situation" is everyone's response... they take that "Above ground" stance but can't even follow through with the things they try to champion about haha.
[2:24:34] limburgse: ever checked out the Asher House, i love that man! he rescues so many animals!
[2:24:35] cryokyle: Well if no one rescues the dogs. they die. so no more overpop. ezpz
[2:24:40] chiefslappov3: You can still rescue puppies at shelters
[2:24:40] yellowgaiden: omg im sorry i started this conflect :D
[2:24:41] oraclesphd: Everyone I've seen use the whole too many dogs has fancy dogs they "got from the shelter"
[2:24:53] minimusmax_: Nothing is wrong with picking a specific breed you want
[2:24:57] Grunstang: I'd do the same since I never had a dog it only makes sense ignore the bleeding heart
[2:24:59] Quackadilly_Flip: are there any rules or regulations surrounding breeding? feel like that’s the main issue, complete chaos in people doing whatever they want
[2:25:02] Prevention6: not all rescue dogs are traumatized I think some are just not wanted unfortunately but not necessarily abused
[2:25:11] eZPked: but bro I think if you are saying you are a new dog owner and putting the argument thats why I got a puppy. Doesn't kinda destroy your argument? I mean if you are new you should get an old dog and train on him right?
[2:25:11] yellowgaiden: ok
[2:25:17] bastiitho: breeders dogs need a home too
[2:25:19] yellowgaiden: if you really want to get in on this
[2:25:24] yellowgaiden: breeds usually have health issues
[2:25:28] Porkypine666: rescue dogs are the sweetest babies youll ever meet
[2:25:29] yellowgaiden: muts are healthier in general
[2:25:32] chiefslappov3: My dog was found stray and I took her in at 4 months old. She is completely moldable and trainable.
[2:25:32] larzbarz: dogs are family you should be picky
[2:25:33] yellowgaiden: less problems
[2:25:34] HeyItsBlumpers: @Quackadilly_Flip problem is, regulation just creates black markets
[2:25:34] Porkypine666: both of mine are and they are my besties
[2:25:36] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[2:25:39] neon_wow: If someone wants a dog it is not their responsibility to take in someone else's mistake.
[2:25:43] Supersikness: I feel like it's the same equivalent as saying you can't have your own kids because there are babies that need to be adopted.
[2:25:44] ZeldaSykes: @yellowgaiden pugs can hardly breathe yep
[2:25:44] angryhatter: its really just unfortunate that taxes arnt allocated properly to stop back yard breeders.
[2:25:48] 4F4Monteiro: im doing the same with my wife, we only want one boy so if a daughter comes out we might sell it
[2:25:49] ntmr_: no hate from me, either way you gave a dog a home and that's to be respected :)
[2:25:54] angryhatter: backyard breeding should be illegal and massive fines
[2:25:58] PurefectionsTTV: @yellowgaiden that's actually exact opposite of
[2:26:05] TobyNova: They'd end up in shelters yeh
[2:26:06] eZPked: those dogs wouldnt be born at some point
[2:26:06] AbejiSE: My sister had her arm almost bitten off by a rescue when she was 7
[2:26:06] yellowgaiden: no its not

[2:26:13] TobyNova: and they'd go out of business
[2:26:15] einself111: Is it unethical to have kids too ? since there are a lot of orphans you could adopt
[2:26:17] its_momo1: they would stop breeding more
[2:26:19] chiefslappov3: How would they not have homes if they are not born?
[2:26:21] Chach4life: well they could jkust give them
[2:26:22] WikidVibez: breeders would probably take care of them if something drastic like that happened
[2:26:25] nilsolof123: too many morons both breeding  and buying dogs and cant take care of them and just leave them
[2:26:26] geezyxtv: @einself111 hahaha valid point there bud.
[2:26:26] GregWasTaken: @angryhatter not with milfs tho
[2:26:27] Chordgaille: its the same argument as veganism. in my mind, theres a clear right answer, but im not going to hold you to that answer.
[2:26:27] yellowgaiden: im sure there are breeds that are super healthy
[2:26:33] supermaduro24: @sonii  how do you your gold farm in world of Warcraft season off discovery
[2:26:37] minimusmax_: There will always be an over population of dogs, because either solution has a long road to fruition

[3:04:35] ohkay710: rip the goat
[3:04:36] macjcool: there is a whole channel some dude runs that plays them
[3:04:38] xbento: I probably have 1000000 hours of reckful viewing
[3:04:38] yellowgaiden: i only heard of reckful, i never watched him
[3:04:40] betterdayz1996: when he played arena it was so cleannn his warr, rogue
[3:04:44] Conditions1: I watch the reckful streams where he miss's leathal LUL
[3:05:04] slaayeri: isn't there a channel dedicated?
[3:05:06] slaayeri: ye

[3:05:12] Porkypine666: ReckfulRerun
[3:05:14] lebrun_james_: its his account
[3:05:16] Porkypine666: follow it
[3:05:18] Ashirok: think so
[3:05:18] dj_efx: he gave his mod the power
[3:05:19] ohkay710: twitch saved it
[3:05:21] KTrillzTV: Why'd he get banned again? Did he quit streaming and the game after that?
[3:05:21] Brosie1987: I miss reckful :'(
[3:05:23] tylive52: when youre the goat youre always saved
[3:05:27] ohkay710: twitch recognized reckful
[3:05:35] 12typhoon12: Are you done with classic hc?
[3:05:36] dj_efx: his mod was editor and DLed all of his vods. he has permision from the family
[3:05:43] minusoner: he put twitch on the map, they owe him that much
[3:05:52] keqqo: yoo you use strava random ass question
[3:06:03] Hunt2103: maybe its the same 30 vods
[3:06:06] dj_efx: oh damn what, so u just gotta ask twitch maybe
[3:06:09] izsaktu: I'd watch him and Mitch do arenas while I played monster hunter or WoW
[3:06:15] Porkypine666: sometimes its very sad because of the way chat is treating him, but all in all its good to see those moments in time again
[3:06:25] xbento: I started with wow and enjoyed  everything afterward, I could watch reckful stream paint drying idk man
[3:06:29] fishtower404tv: I think there's a way to prolong publication time if you have streamlabs, no? I don't know much about this, so don't quote me on it
[3:07:05] fishtower404tv: True, hours of stream in a single day is bug
[3:07:08] fishtower404tv: *big
[3:07:14] wsquish: good idea man :)
[3:07:19] xbento: I think reckfuls stuff is in the cloud somewhere also, may be because of the twitch thing
[3:07:20] youngclip: no reason not to
[3:07:22] Hunt2103: its easy money

[3:09:25] karrots96: whatever mitch's producers do for his youtube vod's is s tier
[3:09:45] Stiimpy89: All you have to lose is time and once you get it setup won't even take time
[3:09:45] Hunt2103: but it would help with growth as well

[6:04:11] Spooferproofn: zhonas could be fine for whei ult?
[6:04:16] basedkami9: stormsurge would be decent
[6:04:17] fateofwaves: did they take mythics out of the game
[6:04:28] oriskordatos: It's a tank meta :/
[6:04:29] nickcero: yeah this is a hard teamcomp for ahri

[6:14:12] Munkeeboy007: type yo for pizza
[6:14:41] bodadieda: He didnt have smite?
[6:14:41] Tosan: trundle had the 1v5 he just got unlucky

[6:15:29] theJOATx: gg
[6:15:33] bodadieda: gg
[6:15:39] Gutstv213: gg

[6:16:49] Sigma_333: ye
[6:16:51] Zhasch: for sure! im staying awake 4 am in sweden for this. great content :D
[6:16:52] theJOATx: were just waiting for the rage
[6:16:52] nickcero: yeah 󠀀
[6:16:54] Noftie: yes chill
[6:16:57] kiki_speaks: It's alright
[6:16:58] steenmachine: pretty fun to watch honestly
[6:16:59] bodadieda: yeah
[6:16:59] Noftie: awesome
[6:17:00] logic__: yeah its chill
[6:17:01] basedkami9: use u.gg, dont listen to chat kekw
[6:17:02] Conditions1: I'm banning ori LUL
[6:17:09] Spooferproofn: enjoying the vibes
[6:17:29] theJOATx: you lose because of your team almost 100% of the time. very frustrating game
[6:17:57] theJOATx: i said almost
[6:18:16] totelol: thats 99%
[6:18:18] Zhasch: to be fair you can carry most of the games so thats delussional for sure :D
[6:18:19] Dtectv2: Im bronze but only lose due to my team KEKW
[6:18:25] AdamFourtyTwo: pros climb league from scratch all the time
[6:18:27] bodadieda: When you are in promotion games for next rank it's 90% teams fault. losing their lane feeding etc
[6:18:28] Grehdeh: ye thats peak low elo delusion
[6:18:32] theJOATx: like trundle running in there and inting on baron
[6:18:33] nickcero: yeah
[6:18:36] theJOATx: that wasnt your fault
[6:18:36] Conditions1: Enemy Blitzcrank is 9-1 in bot lane and here I am in top lane being 2-0 and getting clapped by a support robot
[6:18:36] AdamFourtyTwo: yes
[6:18:37] rockoelol: yes
[6:18:38] Spooferproofn: 1000
[6:18:39] AdamFourtyTwo: no doubt
[6:18:39] Arimantha_: Yes
[6:18:40] logic__: probably
[6:18:41] rockoelol: 100%
[6:18:41] FknWorst: yes
[6:18:43] Greitda: yeah, just play front to back against that team
[6:18:47] Zhasch: ye by picking nilah pre fights and stuff
[6:18:47] theKinaid: no cause ahri Kappa
[6:18:48] Greitda: dont dive
[6:18:48] Dtectv2: Yes you would of shit on your laner 1v1 then roamed and helped side lanes
[6:18:52] basedkami9: you needed more prio in lane
[6:18:56] Arimantha_: Their carries would be dead every fight
[6:19:07] basedkami9: mid lane can carry hard with roams, if you get prio then you can roam bot or top frreely and help get OBJs
[6:19:16] bodadieda: Yes but you have to go pick off champs in other lanes when mid to really snowball
