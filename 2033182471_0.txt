[4:20:37] Colt_Engineer: My favorite was the old Everquest forum posts of Frasiviabi calling people the R word
[4:21:03] metavahn231: i think some blizz game devs just like the prestige, maybe nto even passionate about the game anymore
[4:21:06] Nokterian: Morgan is fun in interviews

[4:30:40] smashwow: the look in Morgan's eyes when someone asked him about the WA arms race was very telling. he acted like he was getting his rocks off on that shit.

[4:32:02] wareagle07: it’s like politicians, they will say whatever for your votes (subscriptions) even if it’s a bold face lie.
[4:32:22] Colt_Engineer: They're just fighting a wrong fight. People came up with weakauras to be better at the game.
[4:33:42] Colt_Engineer: I think all game devs need to listen less to the professional gamers who get paid to play video games competivley and listen more to the people who want to play their games but work 40 hour work weeks.
[4:33:50] smashwow: please tell me they took chicken men out back and shot them for reset
[4:33:57] metavahn231: ffxiv proves you can still have hard content without that stuff

[4:34:37] Molvonos: Thats not really a fair comparison.
[4:34:51] Molvonos: Considering most addons for end game content are banned or some such
[4:34:57] Colt_Engineer: ffxiv are a different breed of people though LUL
[4:35:20] metavahn231: they also dont have to overtune it in mind of that

[4:35:42] Colt_Engineer: also ffxiv devs are eastern developers who have put their heart and soul into the game
[4:36:21] Nokterian: Shadowbringers was one of the best expansion i played
[4:36:21] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[4:36:28] Colt_Engineer: they literally went on stage after the initial ffxiv bombed release and cried on stage in front of players and promised to make the game better, and they delievered
[4:36:51] metavahn231: why they so scared to do a graphical update

[4:37:01] ambiotic: i just get soooooo bored
[4:37:08] metavahn231: cause people keep saying they cant even see the mechs without addons LUL
[4:37:14] cyrex172: the only thing i liked about ff 14 was the card game
[4:37:18] Colt_Engineer: @bluecesti I think the graphics look aamzing
[4:37:31] cyrex172: i played the card game more than the actual game
[4:37:41] Nokterian: ARR is still a slog..despite a bunch of the fat they cut its still tooooo long for new players
[4:37:49] ambiotic: the story is good, like real good, but man its like squirting lemon juice in my eye doing all the crap to unlock story beats
[4:37:53] Colt_Engineer: I like when you read out the head nod. "Nod."
[4:37:55] cyrex172: triple triad
[4:37:57] DrkPhoenix6913: thats because triple triad is fucking awesome

[4:38:42] cyrex172: but nah lol
[4:38:48] Colt_Engineer: LUL
[4:39:00] KaisenSiru: ketsukNod
[4:39:09] ambiotic: GW2 is the only other MMO that has roped me in for an extended period of time

[4:39:57] ShadowDMG6969: lol
[4:40:11] wareagle07: wow just feels like home. it may not always be the most caring home but it’s still home.
[4:40:18] Nokterian: True
[4:40:35] Verdell263: The ElvUI team has a mod for FF14, DelvUi
[4:40:39] Nokterian: KEKW
[4:40:43] ambiotic: Tanking is so boring in FF tho. Wish ESO style tanking was the norm
[4:40:47] Molvonos: @wareagle07 I like it when WoW beats me with a pair of jumper cables.
[4:40:55] cyrex172: @wareagle07 wow is like an abusive foater home where nobody loves or gives a fuck about u lol
[4:41:02] Nokterian: I need details in my ffxiv a lot of WoW players
[4:41:06] cyrex172: foster
[4:41:06] HaxzorJimDuggan: the main ff14 addon i use is just a simple checklist thing for daily and weekly stuff
[4:41:09] Colt_Engineer: remember the five D's, dodge, dip duck dive, and dodge
[4:41:40] smashwow: i like the monocrhomatic schema blizzard uses. makes it really easy to see the red on red on red mechanic... RREEEE
[4:41:48] MoonwalkingAngel: theres nothing to do exept dungeons and raids i find ff14 boring

[4:42:28] Mecabeast: Nymue as a demon hunter is toxic
[4:42:30] smashwow: that mythic add was awful. you couldn't even see the damn cone
[4:42:53] Colt_Engineer: @Mecabeast just stay still bruh LOL
[4:43:03] ShadowDMG6969: I'm color blind so I've had to just give up playing certain things in WoW
[4:43:07] SpidercowSD: They went all out on the Red in the Xpac
[4:43:28] Nokterian: hey here is more red!
[4:43:31] Nokterian: LuL
[4:43:35] smashwow: colorblind mode on nymue was awful
[4:43:36] PrillaGorilla: not well
[4:43:38] Stonegrasp: but but but but the colorblind tools Blizz gave fix that... yeah.
[4:43:46] Bernardo994: lol
[4:44:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: mythic mekkatorgue in BFA caused issues for us since we had a color blind player. we had to start calling out the shape instead of the color
[4:44:01] ShadowDMG6969: There is Add ons I'm sure but like I had to have people call out where I'm standing & tell me where they need me to move
[4:44:27] smashwow: it'll be shades of grey depending on the color blind type i think
[4:44:52] smashwow: which i feel like is kinda worse

[4:46:39] grimmlols: how bout them lions baby!!!!
[4:46:46] Stonegrasp: I really liked the pacing of Amirdrassil... felt like there wasn't waves and waves of trash to deal with.

[4:47:47] geokouts: for the valley?
[4:47:48] Colt_Engineer: @heydjsz ew
[4:47:52] ShadowDMG6969: The worst part is I wasn't born color blind I became color blind due to nerve dmg so it's still weird adjusting even 6 years after teh incident
[4:47:53] geokouts: or where you came?
[4:48:06] ShadowDMG6969: @Colt_Engineer Ew you Steelers rock

[4:49:20] ShadowDMG6969: &*
[4:49:27] flyingmachin3: like a fetid?
[4:49:56] clambynature: Would you rather have more mechanics per fight or have less mechanics that are harder?
[4:50:16] Stonegrasp: One of our raid leaders is employed There* and spoke with the designer of Nymue... they are FULLY aware of what was going on... so they definitely know the BS that people feel with that fight.
[4:50:28] Mecabeast: My aotc guild only struggles on reclears for smolderon no issues with any other boss
[4:51:00] clambynature: hmm
[4:51:22] KroniclyLazy: Razorgore had some good yet challenging mechanics at first
[4:51:30] Stonegrasp: ayep... green + green + GREEN + green BS
[4:51:53] smashwow: i mean the devs aren't dumb. they've been doing this for several xpacs. they just don't address it or can't
[4:51:57] Stonegrasp: I understand wanting to be thematic... but... oof... it's a GAME. XD
[4:53:02] smashwow: consider that part of not addressing it
[4:53:19] smashwow: like maybe we should take feedback. but naaaaaah
[4:53:45] geokouts: and MAYBE those 1 shot mechanics occure 2 times!

[4:55:14] Syllvn: Depends how late they are in an encounter.
[4:55:15] smashwow: one shot = ion saying get good boomies
[4:56:00] ambiotic: Like Soccer had one shot mechanics, but you could outplay it pretty quickly after taking some pulls. I am not sure that is the case with this raid, too much clicking a macro and waiting for direction

[4:56:23] ambiotic: Nylotha
[4:56:38] KaisenSiru: Xanesh
[4:56:39] ambiotic: the weakaura was just a line tho
[4:56:58] ambiotic: Not like here let me send a notification to other users
[4:57:15] Rudric_Ice: addons made the game where its at right now especially WA's and shit
[4:58:06] Rudric_Ice: theres no turning back now without them getting FLAKED if they decide to do so
[4:58:23] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee Yeah Addons/Macros/Scripting is getting wild in WoW. PvP Bots and Scripting for insta kicks ect has been bad all patch, I cant imagine what top tier Raiders have to script and use
[4:58:27] ambiotic: The problem is the smolderon orbs are hard enough and there is no reason for the macro. It doesn't add complexity at all
[4:58:50] StraightErro: backpeddle champ
[4:59:44] Stonegrasp: HAH

[5:12:25] DaCrazyAngus: 96% of the time it works 100%
[5:12:41] im_capy: Turned you up loud, and used you as a sales pitch to my wife
[5:12:43] Treevinal: They are also built really well, not the plastic crap Logitech has been putting out
[5:12:43] im_capy: looking good
[5:12:43] Zuhbuumafu: can't use open back in an office setting, it does release noise
[5:12:52] im_capy: might be getting some new headphones LUL
[5:13:46] Zuhbuumafu: it's not loud, just noticeable if you're in a super quiet office.

[5:24:38] TheItalianStallion321: i thought the 1st Aquaman was good
[5:24:47] PadidinJones: They cut most of her lines appearantly
[5:24:48] DarkBlueTree: they cut out a lot of her speaking parts
[5:24:57] cyrex172: was there nothing else better out to see?
[5:25:06] im_capy: did she really need a lot of lines?

[5:26:00] TheItalianStallion321: i just wanted to see Michael Keaton
[5:26:05] codefiveone: the actor that plays aquaman doesn't have a personality which makes for a movie or show - nothing he's been in is good
[5:26:15] Amarlian: Free skinning!
[5:26:15] RogueBear: the flash was okay. but it was like he spends the whole movie learning not to fk with time then he does it again
[5:26:25] Amarlian: you are helping respawns!
[5:26:25] TheItalianStallion321: @ambiotic Superman? wasnt good to you?

[5:26:49] dragonsdream81: its a quest
[5:26:55] im_capy: at least they loot for you too

[5:27:14] ashwing_: LUL
[5:27:17] ambiotic: Nah Superman blew, i do not need to see a slow mo shot every 3 seconds. Superman should be fun and feel retro not some lame gritty drama
[5:27:18] Rudric_Ice: they can only spit on the ground
[5:27:26] cyrex172: @brodih_ i feel the same way bout nicholson  just plays himself
[5:27:27] DaCrazyAngus: drop rate
[5:27:31] im_capy: "im helping respawn timers"
[5:27:32] ambiotic: bring back christopher reeves style lol
[5:27:40] Mecabeast: Think horde an alliance have a quest to kill them in stonetalon
[5:27:41] RogueBear: the CG in the flash was garbage. the plot was good but to be fair, its kind of hard to mess up the flashpoint storyline
[5:27:53] geokouts: Martha!
[5:27:57] nada_esteban: nah the new superman duality of will he wont he is great
[5:27:57] Rudric_Ice: u mean the Martha movie ?
[5:27:58] im_capy: Best part was just batman and superman fighting each other
[5:28:07] ambiotic: I am also pretty superhero fatigued
[5:28:22] cyrex172: superman vs batman was trash
[5:28:22] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[5:28:34] Malarick: I hated that movie...
[5:28:45] Molvonos: DC's got some horrible writing.  Always has.
[5:28:47] nada_esteban: loki used the staff to control superman duh LOL
[5:28:49] im_capy: they have had so many of the superhero movies, hard to keep writing the back story to go along the 10th boss fight
[5:28:52] Nokterian: its such a weird movie
[5:28:57] ambiotic: Peacemaker on the other hand fucking rocked
[5:29:18] Rudric_Ice: all DC movies suck except the batman movies

[5:29:39] expbottles: I mean currently there’s 2 jokers, Phoenix and Keoghan
[5:29:39] Malarick: Snyder Cut of Justice League was waaaaay better than the theatrical release
[5:29:39] nada_esteban: you didnt like the justice league one?
[5:29:44] cyrex172: high praise
[5:29:44] Purplous: wb flash show is excellent IMO
[5:29:46] notColt45: Flash was nice because that's probably the only flash movie that will exist
[5:29:53] nada_esteban: i thought that was way better than both endgame
[5:29:58] Nokterian: the issue with WB was when they saw Marvel and tried to do the same but clearly didnt thought that they had this planned for years
[5:29:58] instant_savage: did u watch arrow?
[5:30:21] PadidinJones: Def needed a better buildup to get JC movie
[5:30:25] RogueBear: they tried to pull a thanos with Darkseid and really dropped the ball on the delivery i think with Justice League
[5:30:37] im_capy: I personally like Watchmen and movies like that, little grimmer

[5:31:12] Rudric_Ice: Watchmen is one of my fav superhero movies
[5:31:14] nada_esteban: @im_capy i think thats why ppl like invincible or the boys

[5:33:20] im_capy: I never saw the blue beetle, but I can easily see why it would be better
[5:33:21] ashwing_: DCEU should stay dead and James Gunn's plan does not look any better tbh
[5:33:30] nada_esteban: he gets a scrab attached to his back and gives him superpowers
[5:33:31] notColt45: Blue beetle had love in it. Aquaman has been in production since like 2018-2019
[5:33:32] im_capy: did any Aquaman movie do "good"?

[8:06:33] KShellZx: he was insanely OP
[8:06:49] Layercake: LUL true
[8:06:50] ambiotic: I will say despite the doom and gloom OW2 pumps out content
[8:07:08] MedicineMan: Imagine a Skyrim style Warcraft game
[8:07:13] ambiotic: POE announces a week before the patch comes out, so they are trying to copy that
[8:07:16] CeruleanStar: you just made me want to play D3 new season again lol
[8:07:21] ambiotic: But POE has diehards diablo does not
[8:07:39] PadidinJones: @Towelliee been meaning to ask you, what KVM do you use?

[8:07:45] NicStone8: yea should not copy that
[8:07:47] im_capy: Diablo Immortal proving more lucrative, D4 on back burner  Kappa
[8:08:14] NicStone8: when they promised ona  live stream for updates with open convo about changes for community discussion. they should not go away from this

[8:10:19] KeidooTV: its crazy how bad they have done with diablo 4, game should have been delayed, funny thing is D3 plays better and also feels smoother than d4

[8:11:12] Layercake: Maybe after the 1st expansion things pick up
[8:11:26] ambiotic: crafting is such a hug part of arpgs and for them to not have any end game crafting is such a huge mistake
[8:11:57] KeidooTV: lvling was the best part anything after was just bad for me to be honest
[8:12:35] ambiotic: Heh
[8:12:37] CeruleanStar: you just beat the hardest boss in classic
[8:12:52] CeruleanStar: that elevator
[8:12:53] KeidooTV: they leaned nothing about d3 mistakes when released lol
[8:13:14] ambiotic: D3 was an arcade game that last 2 weeks at season launch
[8:13:31] KeidooTV: you just nailed it @Towelliee
[8:13:36] ambiotic: its not what is needed, they need to go more hardcore and add more complexity
[8:13:48] ambiotic: If we go back to set gear then it will be the death of d4
[8:14:03] Layercake: trying to make a for everyone end up making a game to no one
[8:14:33] Syllvn: @ambiotic They absolutely do not need to alienate more players, leave that to POE, POE might be more loved atm but D4 of 10x bigger

[8:23:57] 91Niki: Oh my bad. I have been afk :p
[8:24:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: im probably going the no trade faction, rank 9 of the other one has a chance for when a set piece drops the rest of the set drops and that just sounds to nice to pass up

[8:26:19] Dxg516: which version of wow?
[8:26:29] Utmost777: what game is this
[8:26:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: Rank 9: Full Set Drop Chance. When a Set item would drop, the whole set drops instead.
[8:26:36] 91Niki: Last Epoch
[8:26:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah its rank 9 of 10 so probably takes a bit to unlock
[8:26:48] Utmost777: is it an expansion?
[8:27:12] 91Niki: @Utmost777 What he is playing right now? That is Season of Discovery
[8:27:17] ambiotic: On an Alt, it will take you awhile to grind to rank 9 so at that point your main should be pretty geared

Characters in a different game mode, such as Solo Challenge, or Standard Cycle, do have their reputation separated in the same way the player Item Stash is."
