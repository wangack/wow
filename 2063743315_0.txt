[0:19:14] LeeroyJJenkins: @Amithilis HUH
[0:19:17] Boreall: WoW just isn't made for consoles
[0:19:17] Slapsstick: the audio is AMAZING Im bricked
[0:19:19] leubinator: maybe gamepass comes to wow
[0:19:21] Squats3: it doesnt make sense but also.... gamepass doesnt make sense.
[0:19:23] pbnj_kills: its already sub based so it doesnt make sense
[0:19:25] Amithilis: @LeeroyJJenkins i said what i said
[0:19:27] TheBroCrow: I think ESO isn't on GP, and that's MS-owned
[0:19:27] mohappyy: do you know why we don't see another species invading earth, cause civilisations discover something from reality so they don't have to spread to new stars, and you are seeing it, you see virtual reality forming in your eyes and you think future generations have ambition for rocket science
[0:19:28] Taytor: I mean. I always have gamepass for stuff anyways, so if it can savem e buying TWW
[0:19:30] nanerpus_: Game will be gamepass, sub will still eb required, there are other games like that
[0:19:32] Olivens: if not wow what would it be? CoD? SC2?
[0:19:32] surpriseparty20: Wow to gamepas sounds like a hard cope
[0:19:35] Drenwow: Maybe they put the game but not the sub
[0:19:38] beast2: my guess is diablo sales peaked so its a value add for gamepass
[0:19:41] Drenwow: Like you dont pay the 90$
[0:19:46] XaturesRTB: hs
[0:19:48] Sheepeal: Jd just killed fyrakk go bully him :D
[0:19:51] Amithilis: @LeeroyJJenkins (idk if you were here yesterday but audio was fucked and sound came from "behind" bc of the mix)
[0:19:59] BigTheTank: I mean Gamepass ultimate already gives you EA Play completely free so maybe they add a wow sub?
[0:20:05] LeeroyJJenkins: @Amithilis I was lol, just phrasing
[0:20:08] Drenwow: after 3 month
[0:20:09] Drenwow: but yea
[0:20:17] ShaggySummers: They added enough ways to spend aditional money by now and the initial sales are done. It's the perfect time to put in on Game Pass @Maximum
[0:20:18] Amithilis: @LeeroyJJenkins oh for sure. phrasing intentional. but also wanted to give contex bah
[0:20:18] Taytor: yep
[0:20:18] Squats3: @Maximum every 1st party title comes to gamepass day 1.
[0:20:22] veiloflonelystars: d4 cashed out now gets put into game pass
[0:20:23] nanerpus_: Microsoft has said all first party games will be gamepass
[0:20:34] OG_Kawngi: Bobby had a hard anti-sub stance
[0:20:36] ShaggySummers: "massive amounts"
[0:20:49] Squats3: did you pay for last epoch?
[0:20:55] demepunkk: You think the president of blizzard will be a "Game pass enjoyer" instead of D4 now?

[0:24:11] mohappyy: if your own experience is where you can ever see,  you life should be your best and highest ambition
[0:24:16] Squats3: i think that was pre echo dominance.
[0:24:21] spujetti: Nah the Dorki Growl team beat echo too

[0:33:00] LilDikBigHrt: It's a diamond
[0:33:01] NotD4k: ye
[0:33:02] blonzyy: Funnily enough the actual lore of moonkins (as the beasts themselves) are that they were blessed by elune to protect important sights of nature
[0:33:05] blonzyy: so it is pretty fitting
[0:33:21] xxpurplehazen: 4Head

[0:35:06] leubinator: bommie-bear-cat-resto-boomie 󠀀

[0:36:18] Joneim: For sure
[0:36:22] pseudobudo: druid of the claw
[0:36:23] blonzyy: druid of the claw
[0:36:25] Dandusis: druid of the claw
[0:36:30] pseudobudo: wilsdtalker is feral restro
[0:36:31] Jazzarus_: they can expand this in the future to have 2 more trees, one for moonkin+ feral, and one for guardian+resto. Since they dont share trees.
[0:36:31] blonzyy: wildstalker is feral / resto
[0:36:32] ShaggySummers: the last one is Growl D:
[0:36:39] pseudobudo: flipped last two
[0:36:39] Frilner: feral and resto is wildstalker, druid of the claw is feral guardian
[0:36:41] vinarb: @Maximum wildstalker is resto + feral
[0:36:42] guynormally: swap claw and wildstalker tho
[0:36:50] BigTrout3: eventually chat
[0:36:53] Dandusis: switch druid of the claw and wildsttalker
[0:36:54] sardow90: swap wildstalker and druid of the claw
[0:36:59] TotallyNotRaien: balance and feral makes no sense
[0:37:18] Zarroe: bla
[0:37:20] FrilleJr: Madge
[0:37:21] xxpurplehazen: RAGEY use the paint bucket
[0:37:24] Miril9: NotLikeThis
[0:37:28] Dandusis: jesus... why did ask you to fix it...
[0:37:32] blonzyy: druids of the claw in lore are furries
[0:37:32] Joneim: Why are the restos stalking
[0:37:34] dapps231: dapps231 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:37:37] logicaltty: resto druids are cats half the time anyway
[0:37:44] ewevix: ctl c > ctl v any white area >.<
[0:37:46] JohnnyMcCrit: Flashbang Paint
[0:37:47] GrimFandango: Druids getting Shroud confirmed YEP
[0:37:52] BigTrout3: a resto Druid doing claw things doesn't seem right
[0:37:54] Taytor: Nodders
[0:37:58] Lirnril: really they should share a hero spec between resto, and resto shaman
[0:38:24] Joneim: Didnt they show that tree already?
[0:38:25] iMeista: i mean its part bear so surely
[0:38:34] Goodnevi1: It might be an iron fur or barkskin buff
[0:38:37] GrimFandango: @iMeista more bear form defensives... yaaay...
[0:38:39] Joneim: Or am i smoking some wild shit
[0:38:48] GrimFandango: @Joneim you're on one blud
[0:38:57] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:38:57] Basic_3: Bro, you know Caut exists? They don't give a shit.
[0:39:04] logicaltty: what if the elune's chosen defensive is just bear form? LUL
[0:39:08] TheunGaming: growls take was so based
[0:39:16] Evrymove: can you send the wowhead link?
[0:39:16] TheunGaming: defensive power creep is not good
[0:39:18] colboi: hello top RPG streamer nominee Maximum
[0:39:31] Monpseudobeug: Monpseudobeug subscribed with Prime. 
[0:39:52] Basic_3: Mage should lose 2 defensives
[0:40:01] Taytor: Dawg I could lose my Greater Invis, and I would still be fucking vibing.
[0:40:07] Taytor: Imagine saying losing a 60% dr button is fine
[0:40:13] BigTrout3: to confirm, Elune's Chosen was given out in an early form
[0:40:22] luxumbra69: except in PvP where they would suffer immensely
[0:40:22] dapps231: im ready for the hero talents
[0:40:26] Suwah84: pug mages ain’t tanky bro
[0:40:29] guynormally: *cries in shaman*
[0:40:37] Spibi_: i would give up GI for off gcd barriers
[0:40:42] Lirnril: they should have a blanket rule where cloth classes have 0 defensives, leather classes 1, mail 2, plate 3, ...
[0:40:57] dankNstein_: best defensives, insane group buff, insane way of doing dmg by prio cleaving lmao
[0:41:00] dustin_handsupdb: Say the man that killed AMZ
[0:41:01] maulinx: i mean its world of magecraft man lets be real
[0:41:08] Dsully08: imfiredupThumbsUp
[0:41:17] xheapshotrp: i mean.. arcane gets crushed
[0:41:19] GrimFandango: we need a 60% DR to live certain mechanics. Everything else is 20% DR, which is 20% lower than other classes. I'm all for taking away some of our stuff, but the one strong single-hit DR would be wrong IMO
[0:41:21] theDirtyon3: yes you killed it YEP
[0:41:22] Fun_Mo: How did Max kill AMZ?
[0:41:22] dapps231: i mean you did kill amz lol
[0:41:24] luxumbra69: mages have been the main character all along.

[0:41:42] TommySeeker: no
[0:41:42] neojhins: TRUE
[0:41:46] theDirtyon3: Buff Lock
[0:41:54] RoboMaximillion: nah
[0:41:59] Sover31gn: Mage could have only ice cold and it would be more tanky than healer priests
[0:42:00] taanzfour: max killed range
[0:42:00] Suwah84: COPIUM
[0:42:01] taanzfour: Kappa
[0:42:02] dapps231: we dont HAVE to give you credit lol
[0:42:02] nelis4224: Well im ranged so i can be double Madge
[0:42:09] Lirnril: @GrimFandango taking away defensives systematically would hopefully involve retuning said mechanics
[0:42:22] TommySeeker: Dont drink you coffee like that ever again
[0:42:26] theDirtyon3: as a non DK i dont give a shit what they have
[0:42:32] dustin_handsupdb: Pre nerf AMZ was not fine, and I main DK
[0:42:32] Basic_3: Is Mass Barrier fine?
[0:42:33] Suwah84: yes
[0:42:44] nalegi07: @Basic_3 i mean yeah it only goes on 5 people
[0:42:44] zarvul: do not try to justify what you did
[0:42:49] theDirtyon3: ^ lol
[0:42:49] luxumbra69: remove 100% of defensives. add back in one at a time to maintain balance.
[0:42:51] bigtony466: In hindsight, do you think the PI Nerf was good? At the time it was called a horrible change
[0:42:51] wickywow: @Maximum check this, its some of the elunes chosen ***
[0:42:51] Drax_1224: should they be allowed to have the best defensive cd since no raid buff?
[0:42:52] ninion1337: wow retail is out of touch
[0:43:03] JansonLives: Ret pally needs Mass Bubble.
[0:43:05] OhShetWaddup: he meant power word barrier, pretty sure
[0:43:12] TommySeeker: @ninion1337 you gotta expand on that
[0:43:18] luxumbra69: @OhShetWaddup no
[0:43:36] OhShetWaddup: nvm then
[0:43:42] Basic_3: No I meant mage mass barrier in PvE content
[0:43:43] Sover31gn: What do you think about priests having worst mobility and defensives for diversity sake?
[0:44:20] bexyttv: Whats his # so we can text as well
[0:44:28] Basic_3: Priests are victims of PvP
[0:44:32] Fun_Mo: firstGarf
[0:44:34] LemmingsOCE: Whos queueing up Helldivers with you?
[0:44:43] luxumbra69: @Sover31gn having a 100k+ abosrb on a 6sec CD, and a 20% DR with fade/Flash Heal is pretty good...
[0:44:51] taanzfour: GIVE DOOR OF SHADOWS BRO
[0:44:56] ninion1337: @TommySeeker its just become to much everywhere. Just like poe
[0:45:08] PurpleKami: @Sover31gn those are dog vs most other defensives
[0:45:25] Jazzarus_: I know you're not a pvper but the BG Blitz is fun af, the best pvp mode rn. Can't wait for it to get rated mode.
[0:45:31] Camelbak21: PvP - ruining the game since forever
[0:45:34] alan6778: yes
[0:45:38] denny___xd: silence ye, disperse wouldnt matter
[0:45:42] Drax_1224: just delete pvp 5Head
[0:45:43] joshywoshhyy: unsurmountable hurdle probably
[0:45:45] bobsxo: blizzard doesnt care about pvp tho da hell
[0:45:46] Fun_Mo: Make turbo great again
[0:45:57] Olivens: pvp is a mini game should get removed
[0:45:57] SpeedyMcD: its like how arms warrior is. its not that great in pve but in pvp its constantly a strong class
[0:46:15] jakevib: max has a dumpy
[0:46:19] SpeedyMcD: i mean mythic+ is a mini game too lol
[0:46:22] GrimFandango: firstGarf
[0:46:25] TommySeeker: Dog jail
[0:46:28] susygoblin: BRO HAS THE CROCCS ON LETSGO
[0:46:29] Sover31gn: We need 3 PVE talents in the same way we have pvp talents xdd
[0:46:32] GrimFandango: Look at them Crocs baby!!
[0:46:32] Fun_Mo: firstGarf
[0:46:35] rangermonk: Hey max you sound good today
[0:46:35] Goats48: firstGarf
[0:46:36] Jazzarus_: @Olivens maybe not removed, but separate entirely the balance from pve
[0:46:36] unName96: @bobsxo pvp still have the best rewards in game ...
[0:47:19] bobsxo: @unName96 I mean thats subjective
[0:47:29] Basic_3: Shaman in throne
[0:47:29] luxumbra69: 6sec dispel is BiS at going out of mana. that shit costs WAY too much.
[0:47:33] Fun_Mo: @Sover31gn actually not the worst idea. Would be able to give classes util without breaking it too much
[0:47:44] denny___xd: fall on trash before 2nd boss has a ton of dispels too
[0:47:47] Hamzah39: waycrest
[0:47:57] unName96: afflicted ?
[0:48:04] GILLBERTSON: BRH
[0:48:05] dankNstein_: 6s dispel might be kinda insane in pvp though
[0:48:09] GILLBERTSON: spooderes
[0:48:09] Nickystr1x: disc already despairge about having to press dispel once during ramp
[0:48:29] Bigracc00n: its kinda op for bosses, like top or tojs
[0:48:38] Goats48: idk why they dont add PVE Talents just like how pvpers get 3 talents specifically for PVP @Maximum
[0:48:46] Lirnril: @maximum do you think youre powerful enough that if someone picked a spell in the game completely at random you could fabricate enough discourse to get it nerfed/removed within an expansion
[0:48:52] Nickystr1x: @dankNstein_ they already have access to double dispel honor talent and only play that in certain matchups
[0:49:08] TommySeeker: Nick is a chad
[0:49:11] GrimFandango: @Lirnril you're cooking about Siphon Life aren't you
[0:49:17] CoffeeASAP: It was in beta iirc
[0:49:20] nemziac: because fuck you probably
[0:49:33] tanikins: when evoker time spiral gives me leap of faith back instead of feathers. pain
[0:49:53] knersh_: every talent is a pve talent
[0:49:55] Monpseudobeug: 99%*
[0:49:56] halfwaythug: pvp talents are annoying
[0:50:12] denny___xd: pvp talents is often decisions based on matchups when you see the enemy team in arena
[0:50:15] Lirnril: damn
[0:50:17] denny___xd: some classes you change them every time
[0:50:18] natethenoob1234: amz tho
[0:50:25] Arisolo: he's lying.
[0:50:30] Arisolo: amz
[0:50:35] xxpurplehazen: no Clueless
[0:50:45] TotallyNotRaien: hes trying to lull us into a false sense of security
[0:50:50] malnourish_: professional opinion haver
[0:50:52] Zarroe: max is being humble his power level is over 9000
[0:50:54] Monpseudobeug: PowerUpL EntropyWins PowerUpR MAX POWER HAS NO LIMIT
[0:50:58] Spibi_: i think concescration from paladins are good example that you cant turn it around
[0:51:16] Nickystr1x: @Maximum if only you knew how your name is invoked whenever aug and logs is brought up
[0:51:25] cakerdoodles: @maximum do you think youre powerful enough that if someone picked a spell in the game completely at random you could survive getting hit by it
[0:51:26] smashhammer: can you try exercise your power and get a spell removed?
[0:51:40] RoodToob: if that was true ppal cons would be gone
[0:51:41] yoimdave: yoimdave subscribed with Prime. 
[0:51:41] Basic_3: Consecrate
[0:51:44] Basic_3: Lol
[0:51:50] TommySeeker: Oh like amz
[0:52:01] GrimFandango: can you try and exercise your power and get me to 3.5k IO? Surely that's the only thing holding me back
[0:52:05] Saahf: amz Susge
[0:52:10] rydon96: You basically done this for prot pala tier set this tier
[0:52:17] SirBlayks: Amz KEKW
[0:52:17] daevyfan: @cakerdoodles one rock hit and hes gone
[0:52:32] Basic_3: Siphon Life still exists, so our complaints mean nothing.
[0:52:34] TommySeeker: You made them remove the toe from ww tier
[0:52:50] GrimFandango: ok yeah the Toes thing definitely was Max, there's no way it wasn't
[0:53:02] luxumbra69: Let's talk about talents. WW still getting 4% movement speed for TWO TALENT POINTS.
[0:53:03] codydoubleu: you couldn't do it with any ability, but if an ability has even a shred of negative sentiment for sure
[0:53:08] rydon96: and they didnt change it
[0:53:09] Shirey12: I'm tired of Demo being my only option as a Warlock. I know this is priest stuff but man I'm tired of Demo for 3 expacs in a row now
[0:53:35] luxumbra69: @Shirey12 destro is really good. and destro was kind S4 shadowlands.
[0:53:39] Boreall: PI
[0:53:39] GILLBERTSON: @Shirey12 jut play another spec....
[0:53:44] honeychonker: Moonkins
[0:53:44] Zarroe: power infusion Pog
[0:53:46] dagoxd1986: siphon life
[0:53:47] Jazzarus_: PI
[0:53:47] Fun_Mo: Consecrate
[0:53:48] Boreall: It's undebatably PI
[0:53:49] moodsen: consecration
[0:53:51] NotQuid: serenity please god max
[0:53:52] Pado99: PI. ban it
[0:53:52] taanzfour: pi
[0:53:52] OhShetWaddup: jadefire stomp Madge
[0:53:52] kota_adin: Pi
[0:53:53] Hillzor: Pls delete Windfury totem
[0:53:53] yorden: festermight
[0:53:55] OG_Kawngi: PI
[0:53:55] GrimFandango: Serenity 100p
[0:53:57] codydoubleu: too many Aug abilities to pick tbh
[0:53:57] daybreak_ttv: chaos bolt lol
[0:53:59] Arisolo: ebon might
[0:53:59] corpseren: serenity
[0:54:00] OlaF_oo: water breathing
[0:54:00] bigtony466: Faeline Stomp
[0:54:01] NerdRagedOut: consecration
[0:54:02] Ruinx81: Super keen for Helldivers it looks good!
[0:54:06] Boreall: PI specifically
[0:54:10] leubinator: hunterlust being tied to a pet
[0:54:13] Nickystr1x: heroic throw, GET IT OUT
[0:54:14] Goats48: Faeline Stomp
[0:54:15] Pado99: PI fucks the game so hard.
[0:54:16] neojhins: any takes on some people that may not get to play with the lego even tho people are getting it on their alts?
[0:54:16] GrimFandango: @OlaF_oo LUL
[0:54:19] Glittches: Temporal Warp
[0:54:27] Cxistian: RIP Spirit Shell
[0:54:33] HekticFox: Mage double lust not being a seperate button
[0:54:36] taanzfour: i want to look at my meters and know whats up
[0:54:41] fzybny: Faeline Stomp easy, they removed Rune of Power because it was horrible gameplay but yet FLS is the same thing.
[0:54:44] luxumbra69: let's talk 2h axe leggo. what's the thought?
[0:54:45] AzzaHub: @HekticFox THIS
[0:54:48] Kawatteruwow: actually true
[0:54:50] RoodToob: dmg done to shields not reatributing sends me on fyrakk every time
[0:54:58] Lirnril: @fzybny is it the same as death and decay?
[0:55:04] Shirey12: Siphon Life is only good for stacking Malefic Raptures, it creates button bloat and I don't think they'd rework Aff to reduce button bloat.
[0:55:14] Guko97: killed mythic fyrakk last week. still dont have it
[0:55:14] taanzfour: some people think predicting pi dmg accurately is possible
[0:55:18] Pyrrha_GG: got my lego after 13 weeks feels super bad
[0:55:22] denny___xd: bad luck protection is very bad
[0:55:22] JansonLives: FINALLY dropped for me on Tuesday.
[0:55:23] taanzfour: dentge
[0:55:24] wappiebro: @Maximum will you do the undercover raids again? those were so fun to watch
[0:55:24] Ruinx81: Should have been a quest
[0:55:27] bigtony466: In hindsight, do you think the PI Nerf was good? At the time it was called a horrible change
[0:55:32] denny___xd: me and my friends full cleared since start and nobody has gotten it
[0:55:33] Guko97: blp is 1% per week @Maximum
[0:55:34] gankeds: got the legendary last night this shit blows
[0:55:35] Guko97: SO LOW
[0:55:36] luxumbra69: BLP is fake news. it doesnt fucking work.
[0:55:36] firetanks24: just get better rng
[0:55:39] JansonLives: We had 3 drop on our heoric kill this week.
[0:55:39] JTB_099: Should they do legendaries at all at this point?
[0:55:40] othernewname: 3 vault slots for leggo
[0:55:40] nanerpus_: just adjust the rate of the bad luck protection
[0:55:46] MightyGIGACHAD: @maximum bring back dinar, this game isn’t about trying to get a piece of gear, it’s not 2005 anymore. give us the gear so we can push
[0:55:49] mandbyvgc: last patch was 10% a kill on H. this has to be something dumb like 2.5%
[0:55:50] Guko97: 1% bad luck increase is INSANE
[0:55:50] Karkesis: you don't need to have a solution to point out a problem
[0:55:51] eyeztea: my paladin has 11 fyrak kills no leggo, my dk has 5 and has lego
[0:55:52] Mythos24: If everyoen had a legendary, it wouldn't be legendary...
[0:55:53] OlaF_oo: hidden bar you fill with doing pve content
[0:55:53] pbnj_kills: still havent gotten it
[0:55:57] HekticFox: Leggo acquisition this expac is worse than start of legion. Should just get 1-10/ 50 fragments after first kill or something per week
[0:56:00] misterworldhide: *cough* not everyone should be max geared *cough*
[0:56:01] ArchieSin: why not just get fragments every kill which eventually combines into the legendary?
[0:56:06] BiBaButzeBenne: it drops left and right each week now, but some mains are just out of luck watching their guildmates' alts
[0:56:09] the_great_simonator: I've seen 2 drop in a single fight and I still haven't gotten it :(
[0:56:10] denny___xd: questline like mist of pandaria was way better than rng from last boss
[0:56:17] JTB_099: Like VR loot and Legos feel bad if its just a few classes and they are balanced around it
[0:56:20] codydoubleu: it seems like killing on Normal every week for the whole patch wouldn't guarantee someone to get it, kinda weird
[0:56:21] daybreak_ttv: i got it 2 weeks ago finnaly and then quit playing cuz i was burnt out
[0:56:21] NooboniousPrime: just gate it behind like 4 weekly Fyrakk kills
[0:56:21] nairb1: drop rate isnt any different, it's always been 50/50
[0:56:21] 3V3R357: look at Shadowmourne, do it again.
[0:56:24] Pyrrha_GG: feel like it should be 3 weeks minimum 7 week maxiumum
[0:56:26] ThreesFG: it feel so bad not having it still despite raiding every week

[0:56:29] GrimFandango: @misterworldhide If you play for 4 months straight every single week, you should be max geared, hands down.
[0:56:33] lathander557: Well you don't even feel awesome when you get the drop this time, you feel despair for having to spend a shitload of gold and do a lot of quests.
[0:56:37] Lirnril: they probably just need to dial back on RNG, bad luck protection or not, and be honest about having to make a number go up by so much so it's transparent
[0:56:38] Pyrrha_GG: assuming you are doing raid every week
[0:56:42] denny___xd: @Maximum do you think mist of pandaria questline to get legendary was better than rng drop from last boss currently?
[0:56:42] drumminbacon: dude the legendary should be either scarce OR hard to make. this one is both and that fucking blows
[0:56:46] luxumbra69: we need guaranteed end date for leggo acquisition.
[0:56:48] Camelbak21: Try doing m+ without lego, I don't think you can get invited to pus
[0:56:52] Squats3: and just never got it
[0:56:54] Camelbak21: pugs
[0:56:55] Kerandes: our ret got the leggo first id after rwf was over
[0:56:58] Slapsstick: @lathander557 your bloods pretty good
[0:56:59] mycho_: didn't catch much of the last epoch stream last night, how do you feel about that game?
[0:56:59] mandbyvgc: pushing 26s on ret without the wep feels bad
[0:57:03] Taytor: Our maintank has 4 blood DKs trying to get the leggo for our fyrakk prog @Maximum
[0:57:03] Ahrmanhamma: It just has to be somehwat deterministic after some period of time. People believe Bad Luck Protection is supposed to do that, but it definitely doesn't seem to be working noticeably
[0:57:04] Boreall: I don't think it's possible to have a "POG I finally got the legenday this is a huge moment for me!" experience AND also give everybody the Legenday
[0:57:05] Squats3: i just got mine
[0:57:05] Jazzarus_: GIGACHAD
[0:57:08] TommySeeker: Theres a beep?
[0:57:09] fat_european0: Feels like a lot of people quit b4 getting the lego since it takes so long
[0:57:18] Wyvenn: @Maximum how about require like 6 or 8 kills of fyrakk for you to get it? I'm a prot pala and I got it very very early and I don't even use it so its definitely not a memorable moment
[0:57:18] asd123qwerty1: @Maximum whos in the gang
[0:57:19] Ruinx81: Plus when you finally get it you get to run superblooms for a week
[0:57:22] logicaltty: LOGIN
[0:57:25] GrimFandango: 1.0 stream next week? PauseChamp
[0:57:26] 253templar: the fact that critcake doesn't have his lego is a crime
[0:57:39] mycho_: nice! game is pretty fun
[0:58:00] yoimdave: The leggo just seems kind crappy because by the time people finally get it itll be irrelevant and not many people will be playing to get its full potential
[0:58:01] Jazzarus_: sticking to the LE = Disney bit, huh? LUL
[0:58:06] Monsuno: what a take
[0:58:08] burntwall: wed is better than tuesday imo
[0:58:10] Fragplux: EU reset day tho
[0:58:10] the_great_simonator: come on tuesday and thursday is also weird
[0:58:11] PurpleKami: they had server issues last update and probably want a couple days of buffer
[0:58:14] NooboniousPrime: the fact that they have anything in this game tied to rng, like getting the legendary or the BoA alt gear loot box is so dumb
[0:58:14] Lycanus4: no?
[0:58:14] GrimFandango: next Max is gonna say the game has Mobile graphics LUL
[0:58:15] denny___xd: next week is a holiday week for a lot of ppl no?
[0:58:15] Nekz3: it's normal because the game is from disney
[0:58:19] Frilner: Bruh, go down to Burger King, get a couple Whoppers, and just GAME
[0:58:19] ArchieSin: tuesday also corny you just dont notice cause of wow
[0:58:21] Boreall: Is Wednesday even a day of the week? GD Mickey Mouse gang
[0:58:21] honeychonker: yes
[0:58:22] OG_Kawngi: yes
[0:58:23] Taytor: Yeah
[0:58:23] mycho_: yea
[0:58:23] xxpurplehazen: YEP
[0:58:24] the_great_simonator: yep
[0:58:24] Lirnril: it's polite to the operations people to not have to fix the servers on a weekend
[0:58:24] pendragon925: we'd is perfect for me, and yes
[0:58:28] Vanthei: I thought I was going crazy.
[0:58:29] The_Frix: Wokege
[0:58:31] SirPikajew: Oh that's you?
[0:58:32] xxpurplehazen: GIGACHAD
[0:58:32] Ahrmanhamma: Wednesday certainly is a day of the week to release a game
[0:58:33] Touchpadwarrior: gives folks something to look forward to on the most boring day of the week
[0:58:33] 225oce: beep:)beep:)beep:)beep:)beep:)beep:)
[0:58:34] oneifbyland: KEKW
[0:58:39] Ruinx81: Shroud still playing SoD?
[0:58:39] Rahven__: thats some propaganda from big tuesday
[0:58:46] Morinik: Did you get your mic cable last night?
[0:58:54] Shirey12: When's the Helldivers gameplay
[0:58:56] leubinator: whats wednesday i only know third monday garf
[0:58:59] Nickystr1x: "if"
[0:59:14] Arisolo: @Maximum but EU is Wednesday
[0:59:14] Stachee: WEDNESDAY GANG
[0:59:17] lathander557: WoW SoD phase 2 got patched in Tuesday but not unlocked until Thursday KEKW
[0:59:21] Monsuno: Does Wednesday dodge every other games update day?
[0:59:25] Goats48: It should be on a frieday
[0:59:25] Boreall: @Maximum That's so Devs can finalize things on Monday instead of releasing it over the weekend
[0:59:25] osgaming57: in europe its wednesday
[0:59:27] the_great_simonator: tuewsday is super weird
[0:59:27] ashla11: tuesday makes sense from a Dev perspective
[0:59:27] Stu720: They actually started doing that because of WoW.
[0:59:28] Monpseudobeug: Tuesday because you avoid server death
[0:59:29] TotallyNotRaien: its pretty normal because it gives you a lot of time to bug fix if needed through out the week
[0:59:30] Lloyd_on: Tuesday gives you monday to prep and then rest of week to monitor
[0:59:31] TheBoulder_: yea tuesday is historically game release day
[0:59:32] codydoubleu: sets up the office hours best to handle it
[0:59:39] luxury_chicken: it makes sense work week wise, you can prepare monday and tuesday isnt that bad to fix problems
[0:59:39] The9thChevron: Even before video games, movies came out on home video on Tuesdays.
[0:59:41] Boreall: If an update releases on Mondays the Devs don't have much time to last check everything
[0:59:44] ililililliilllililililil: Opened some random persons stream and told her she looks like michael jackson and got insta peremabanned,  am I in the wrong ?
[0:59:47] OhShetWaddup: it's a popular patch day in tech
[0:59:48] mycho_: yea tuesday to setup a big weekend
[0:59:52] Squats3: @Maximum Microsoft has an official patch day (patch tuesday). pretty sure thats why almost everyone started doing releases on tuesdays.
[0:59:57] Jazzarus_: and people go out on weekends so maybe they dont play as much
[1:00:00] TheBoulder_: even way back in the ps2 days games released tuesdayas
[1:00:04] lathander557: lil bit yeah
[1:00:05] khebul: Tuesdayis BIS day to release anything. Releasing anything on Friday means spending the weekend putting out fires
[1:00:07] tanikins: LUL
[1:00:08] xxpurplehazen: ban them here too weirdChamp
[1:00:09] Nickystr1x: DO NOT EVER DO THAT
[1:00:10] Fun_Mo: KEKWait
[1:00:14] nanerpus_: ban them here too
[1:00:15] dustin_handsupdb: @ililililliilllililililil breh
[1:00:16] wappiebro: @Maximum will you do udnercover raid again?
[1:00:16] OG_Kawngi: what a freak
[1:00:18] SyMmBoLz: LUL LUL TEEEEE HEEEEEEEE
[1:00:19] Slapsstick: thats kinda funny, but also why would you say that LUL
[1:00:19] basherbash32: Max you look like Michael Jackson
[1:00:20] Lirnril: rip europeans with wednesday reset
[1:00:43] codydoubleu: razyy g BiS
[1:00:45] b1azzuris: anyone else notice this streamer looks like Michael Jackson?
[1:00:47] Faraday5001: razageth HC is PEAK undercover boss content
[1:00:54] Zarroe: razzy g xdding
[1:00:58] Fun_Mo: Max is your dog laying on top of the other dog?
[1:01:11] Ruinx81: Monk S4????
[1:01:12] ThisIzD: @Fun_Mo its called a dogpile
[1:01:20] spoolster: sire was bis undercover raidleading
[1:01:27] ashla11: Razageth will be interesting with new paladin, played it with old paladin before lol
[1:01:38] Fun_Mo: they moved Sadge
[1:01:39] lathander557: Raszageth aka lightning chicken aka salad-breath aka "someone died to intermission 1 breath"
[1:01:47] Squats3: my guild just randomly went into their mid tier offline mode in the last week or so. we were having 15-20 people online at most times and then this past week its been just 1 or 2 outside of raid
[1:01:47] Boreall: Max is it raid leading or shot called, someone once told me those aren't the same
[1:01:49] Arisolo: what about Sark? feel like that was a good one where teaching people positioning carries
[1:01:50] SunTruth1: mr maximus i cant kill last boss in gnomer in sod, can u raidlead pls @Maximum
[1:01:50] the_great_simonator: healing it was soooooo much fun
[1:01:52] deviljin____: And what does the Priest talent tree tell us about this topic?
[1:01:53] Nickystr1x: sark: "okay here u guys wanna make sure u dont fuck up and wipe us"
[1:02:02] totemic_: i pugged heroic razs in week 2, felt amazing
[1:02:13] Ahrmanhamma: I hated heroic Raz, but i was stuck in pug world during that patch
[1:02:36] dustin_handsupdb: @totemic_ rasz feels absolutely horrible on heroic for people trying to first bridge that gap normal->heroic though - phase 1 is incredibly punishing
[1:02:48] codydoubleu: raids should have a raid leader and a shot caller
[1:02:54] mycho_: imo raidleading assumes you're doing some amount of outside game work before raid, shotcalling is just calling shit
[1:02:55] codydoubleu: just a based gamer who knows whats up
[1:03:26] spivet: the ideal raid leader is a BM hunter main
[1:03:26] tanikins: as a healer RL -- this is so fkn true
[1:03:45] leubinator: remember when he started reading tettles post for a whole half sentence xdd
[1:04:09] demepunkk: so is it better to raid lead from a DPS perspective?
[1:04:22] fatgingi: just tuned in and took me a bit to realize you had a shirt on
[1:04:23] goilen: Are we having our seasonal "max explains raidleading again"?
[1:04:50] srze94: I raid lead Raz HC as a healer, very fun :D
[1:04:53] Lirnril: surely it is important to be like "healers, this is when we heal people!" periodically too
[1:05:07] daiger5o: Max random question since ur shirt is distracting cuz u look naked? Have u ever have abs? @maximum
[1:05:09] Boreall: I was making a light joke I didn't mean to start this I'm so sorry
[1:05:18] xxpurplehazen: Streaming
[1:05:32] Boreall: What's a cock swap
[1:05:35] lathander557: lmao get monologued
[1:05:35] i_like_g_fuel: i_like_g_fuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[1:05:39] Slapsstick: @Boreall cant predict the ADHD tangent sometimes
[1:05:46] SirPikajew: 50,000 sounds about right for Tindral
[1:05:49] xxpurplehazen: ok ty
[1:05:50] JohnnyMcCrit: thats it
[1:05:59] Arisolo: do you feel like your job is less impactful because of analysts?
[1:06:05] Dreww_P: Streaming
[1:06:08] basherbash32: Light joke turned into a poddy c
[1:06:10] lathander557: SOMETIMES getting one-guy'd leads to a good thing
[1:06:12] wkGG67: is max calling the shots?
[1:06:14] con_artist__: good call
[1:06:20] CoffeeASAP: lol
[1:06:27] baseboned: wtf was that tree
[1:06:33] thetoolman22: raiding just seems so unapproachable to me. I have no idea how to even star and feel like I would only hold people back
[1:06:52] mycho_: bug blastin
[1:06:52] Slapsstick: @thetoolman22 send the lfr, theres giga chads to carry while you learm
[1:06:57] xxpurplehazen: Ben bla
[1:06:59] Fun_Mo: Ben Pog
[1:06:59] GrimmshadoXI: @leubinator Classic stream content!
[1:07:03] mycho_: BEN Pog
[1:07:09] Bryyo: hey @maximum today is my birthday and I just turned 30. How do you cope with being old?
[1:07:13] Squats3: i like the idea of helldivers. the game is just not great unless you have a squad to play with
[1:07:16] baseboned: so what, hold people back, its a game, get in there, make mistakes, get better
[1:07:20] lathander557: Raiding becomes much more approachable if you just watch video guides on all the bosses
[1:07:29] ThisIzD: @thetoolman22 join a guild. be honest upfront
[1:07:35] Suited_Monkey: Ben is insane at games*
[1:07:36] shinta__: Ben is great at all games
[1:07:37] Taytor: god I want Ben to stream The Finals so bad
[1:07:38] Rendlaws: are u gona stream it?
[1:07:38] mab_music_ttrpg: ben is just insane. stop there, thats it
[1:07:40] xxpurplehazen: Bryyo its all downhill bud. enjoy each day you have a working body
[1:07:49] lathander557: @Taytor Goated FPS
[1:07:49] surpriseparty20: Name one game/genre Ben is not insane LUL
[1:07:53] Lirnril: @lathander557 is there a video guide on how to get along with ~19 other people
[1:07:55] daevyfan: this game isnt very demanding in terms of shooting mechanics
[1:08:02] Boreall: Do you ever worry that Shroud will replace you as Best Friend with Ben
[1:08:15] Teeemosh: @Boreall xdd
[1:08:26] lathander557: @Lirnril If you can't get along with 19 other people you have to carve your niche of being sarcastic and toxic yet loveable
[1:08:30] hotshotss11: Are you guys playing fresh HD2 accounts?
[1:08:36] thetoolman22: thank you for the tips
