[2:54:29] RowdyYates12: It'll go up, come back down. always happens lol
[2:54:42] MrRKDrop: I live 4 hours away from the nearest city, no chance I am getting electric to travel with
[2:54:42] RowdyYates12: also How's it going Swift
[2:54:45] fizrukh: I live 3h from Kansas city lol, but it was 0,99 $ now its 3,94$
[2:54:49] skauert: The more people moving over to electric, the less demand there'll be for gas. That might offset it.
[2:54:50] RowdyYates12: Yeah hahaha. it's been 10 before
[2:54:52] PapaBeks: people's electric bills are up on average 47% yoy right now
[2:54:54] Roamer_TV: Stupid English, you can’t express the whole depth of your thought in it)
[2:55:00] Neixze: taxes..
[2:55:03] TheRaitaro: All the gamers are going to need to turn off their RGB lights to save money

[2:55:09] cast_710: yeah it was $5 in cali awhile ago
[2:55:09] Sacredspir1t: in greeece its is 2 euros per liter
[2:55:39] RowdyYates12: Member back in 2006/7 it was 7.99 for summer in Colorado. Cali it was like 11 for over 6 months
[2:56:08] avenomxx: get a costco memebership, its a little cheaper
[2:56:16] PapaBeks: @skauert how do they make electricity? where does it come from? it won't offset, that's not how it works
[2:56:20] RowdyYates12: Lucky bastrd. I remember it too well hahaga

[3:00:41] RowdyYates12: @avenomxx I think it was when war was ramping up during the recession
[3:00:45] grandpagolden: I don’t remember but he mainly creates Machinima videos that are both comedic and informative.. kind of.
[3:01:25] RowdyYates12: I loved the videos. I still use a Naga because of the swift VS Marksmen hunter video during Woltk. It was a glorious time
