[14:15:10] Ancor_: I think she thought you were trying to do a lineup and in your SOPs you have certain rules for doing one
[14:15:10] Sparty071: It was just having a witness id a suspect. Since when does that require a line up.
[14:15:12] puppietreats: YEP she just doesn‚Äôt want anyone to get in trouble

[14:15:24] nabstonekido: But you needed a proper lineup for it to stick

[14:15:33] Afterman_: @the_solid_milk  slacks was questioning him about the mr k fight, and he felt johnson was lying/not owning up to his failure to act responsibly, plus the amount of officers who spoke against his actions

[14:15:51] Sparty071: Dont need a proper line up.

[14:16:00] samynilla: Wasn't ramee in there talking his shit
[14:16:04] ZachFromChat: yea it was never a lineup. I think calling it a "lineup room" made everyone start going wild with the idea
[14:16:07] fishnchips333: yes but by excusing it youre not setting a precedent for non line up ids
[14:16:08] AlexSamaAU: its also something the defense attorney should bring up not other officers

[14:16:11] fixer_18: This is a game not irl. Doubt they have laws stating you need proper line up lol
[14:16:11] FaramirRat: What is the point of having all the cops on if they are not trusted to do their job? Gotta ask daddy captain on EVERYTHING, like a friggin child, get out of here with that shit.

[14:16:15] Kota216: sad thing is that cop would totally throw cornwood under the bus in same situation, corn too good of guy <3
[14:16:15] ZachFromChat: literally just ID'ing a suspect
[14:16:19] taraannee: i feel like maybe bring that to a captain then for clarification instead of just dropping that case?
[14:16:20] BoogieAnimal: and you could say there was never a lineup in the first place like there wasn‚Äôt
[14:16:23] adch03: I  mean why do the lineup and just question them on the stand?

[14:16:29] superbizarr0: NODDERS what is a line up at the end of the day its the victim iding a suspect

[14:16:44] holographicslushie: yeah exactly

[14:16:45] Thiccidaddy: show up's typically have a time limit from the time of the incident to do as well.  You just do a warrant after a certain amount of time.

[15:35:24] Shmoopee: in regards to her own case
[15:35:33] rikaus69: Snitches get stitches. Not snitching goes to jail
[15:35:33] MAXATAK: rhansi she already said that earlier in the interview
[15:35:38] existinne: I like her for playing with the courts but omg her and you guys be done to long
[15:35:44] bertacharm: Just make it a stipulation that she'll only make a statement and not take questions
[15:35:46] MAXATAK: but yeah lol
[15:35:46] throat_pump: @lazyowlette a defendant can choose not to take the stand
[15:35:51] rhansi: @MAXATAK ahh must have missed it lol
[15:35:53] HavenAU: telling what they did isnt testifying against them, its just necessary process
[15:35:54] bertacharm: If you can
[15:36:00] Shmoopee: @shymuffin the 5th applies to herself I think
[15:36:07] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: @lemotardz420 modCheck any askers
[15:36:11] CivilisedTurtle: @LazyOwlette Correct me if Im wrong pleading the 5th in circumstances can be  an admission of guilt ?
[15:36:12] Sparty071: Then why not accept the deal
[15:36:25] slomojosh: if there‚Äôs no issue and you know they won‚Äôt fight it then accept the damn deal
[15:36:27] appolloh: @throat_pump wouldn'tthey subpoena her?
[15:36:28] FaramirRat: @LazyOwlette in real life a judge can do whatever the f they want bro, period end of story, aint no one coming to help ya.
[15:36:30] Naruto_AMV_from_2007: @CivilisedTurtle nah, its there for the exact opposite
[15:36:40] ShyMuffin: @Shmoopee okay, I thought she could plead the fifth to stop a line of questioning and thus rendering all her statement invalid
[15:36:46] GlitchyGunZ: at this point, she should just take her charges and go to jail that‚Äôs what this is leading up to lol
[15:36:55] stolenrefund: Just plea bargain, and don't testify against anyone
[15:36:58] Wandering_Ranger: what is Slacks even getting out of this deal?
[15:36:59] properenglishh: Negative you can plead the 5th and not talk to anyone without legal representation that is what its for not just legal standings. Its why Inclusion and diversity is against the law and police cannot enforce it
[15:37:18] slomojosh: @wandering_ranger a guilty plea
[15:37:19] outlawfdz: she wants to do crime without people know shes a rat
[15:37:21] TheWardenBoi: Listening
[15:37:27] existinne: I have forgot what she did now???
[15:37:37] rikaus69: @existinne same
[15:37:40] burncat: @CivilisedTurtle @CivilisedTurtle pleading the 5th is exercising your right to remain silent
[15:37:42] stolenrefund: thats the right move
[15:37:43] Mattwolf325: not we
[15:37:46] DamnitAngel_: its not testifying against. its confirming her own role in their testimony which would be that she is guilty
[15:37:48] Mattwolf325: justnher
[15:37:54] HavenAU: testify on behalf of*
[15:37:54] blahder: Uhhh
[15:37:54] Sparty071: Its a deal. She doesn't want to accept. They all get the charge and no one gets released
[15:37:54] Shmoopee: @outlawfdz Shes willing to take the fall to get her friend out of holding aka indefinite sentence
[15:37:59] existinne: lol @rikaus69 wee
[15:38:01] FaramirRat: @properenglishh great until the judge threatens you with 6 months in jail because you won't answer the question, when your in court the judge is king and they do what they "think" is by the law.
[15:38:02] slomojosh: and also there‚Äôs two people on an indefinite hold too so that‚Äôs probably weighing on her too
[15:38:03] Starrsiege: essaying
[15:38:05] GlitchyGunZ: She can just plea bargain get less time and be done with it too @esfandtv
[15:38:12] throat_pump: @lazyowlette oh, is this not for her personal case? if it‚Äôs not for her as a defendant then yes
[15:38:12] brikbeans: i thought typically you are only compelled if you are accusing someone.
[15:38:20] pmoonbuddy: Cornwood is the only LEO who is not a robot.

[15:38:46] EpicOfGiggamesh: Pacificly
[15:38:54] Ten_Ju: Cornwood representing Sonya is a bad idea because Esfand doesn't know the law.
[15:38:55] properenglishh: Thats under oath and subpoena youre correct @FaramirRat but you can also use the 5th amendment in other situations is what I was stating also.
[15:38:57] existinne: oofmygoodness we need a real crimainal to watch let her gooooooo
