[3:41:57] badkarma2030: in ab
[3:41:58] newkingcody: Those are the crappy little small ones swifty
[3:42:03] Cowardpatty: You do realize that Reeses Cups are the most 'fresh-dependant' candy bar?  Like you can get a 'good' Reeses, or you can get a 'bad' Reeses, depending on what color the peanut butter is
[3:42:03] newkingcody: The full size ones are great
[3:42:15] WOOPsWOOP: Everything has gotten smaller, more expensive and lower quality

[3:42:58] TheBeardedSmarmer: all of them taste bad now because they use palm oil now
[3:42:59] Cowardpatty: You simply got an old Reeses where the peanut butter has dried out.  If you get a new fresh Reeses they are still amazing
[3:43:04] KodiakJedi: Reeses still goated
[3:43:06] MichaelDanmark: what about snickers
[3:43:06] CrayonDeath: They make reese cups with potato chip crumbs in them

[3:43:57] Onehiitter: @Karma_Kid007  exactly
[3:44:02] Cowardpatty: I'm telling you if I got to my 7/11 and buy 20 Reeses and cut them all in half, some will look orange on the inside and some will look beige.  Only the orange ones will taste good.

[3:45:29] seth878: how many miles a day should u run if ur tryna lose weight through mainly cardio?
[3:46:31] KodiakJedi: @seth878 highly suggest the MyFitnessPal ap. You don't have to pay for special features buy you can track calories and put in workouts too
[3:46:31] Krug_z: do you speak portuguese swifty?
[3:46:56] deadvinas: Running alone does not solve the issue, you need to fix your diet
[3:46:57] Treesy__: I would run 500 miles and I would run 500 more...
[3:47:07] yoichinoyumi: swimming probably ?
[3:47:09] jamesip87: Yea u do 🤣🤣🤣
[3:47:13] Ohq__: fastest way to lose weight is eat cleanly
[3:47:16] Krug_z: i thought so
[3:47:23] Treesy__: Strve yourself. Fastest way to lose weight
[3:47:28] KodiakJedi: Calories in = Calories out means stay the same...just make sure you are burning more calries than you take in
[3:47:28] Blitzylive: you can say "the fastest way in my opinion"

[3:48:42] deadvinas: Man. training is only 15% cause of loosing weight, eating is 60% - 70% cause to lose weight
[3:48:43] javzilla: iron deficiency
[3:48:43] Treesy__: Exercise has more benefits than pure weight loss. Heavy resistance training improves your bone density and ligaments nad tendon strength
[3:48:44] Ohq__: Just taking a 30m walk everyday will do amazing things for you
[3:48:46] OteroGaming: Seth as much as u can xD
