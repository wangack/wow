[0:55:26] Reloe: you get slightly larger and grey-ish
[0:55:32] TotallyNotRaien: cant you check dispels on details?
[0:55:50] Reloe: 14s is 2 uses
[0:56:01] rejuvlife: i think he did dwarf it if you look at the lock his appearance changes into stone form
[0:56:08] shadowdemoni: it was fast
[0:56:13] Reloe: probably has some generic WA that tells him to stoneform if he has any debuff that you can use it on xdd
[0:56:31] Sebleh: poggies first depleto
[0:56:41] Fraantic: on 26 key level people still do not know boss mechanics
[0:56:53] toxaaris: not with that mindset :p
[0:57:06] toxaaris: "I can do it!"
[0:57:06] Sebleh: bro just get a rice cooker the timing is built in you literally cannot burn a rice if you use it
[0:57:10] Aldar691: Rise is always tricky
[0:57:23] Aldar691: the RP is not your friend in there
[0:57:26] Fraantic: rise is very hard cuz the timer doesnt account for all the walking around and rp u have to do
[0:57:29] Sebleh: tight timer yeah
[0:57:32] fennrirq: @Naguura yeah rise is sick especially last boss and orbs mech imho
[0:57:35] Fraantic: timer should be 50 min with all that rp and walking around
[0:58:00] skyesarrow: yeah rise is by far the hardest dungeon it’s all others are a joke compared
[0:58:11] Fraantic: 24 rise = 26 of any other dungeon
[0:58:14] STCMASI: I've done 24 rise, which fell from a 28
[0:58:20] Fraantic: 26 rise = 28 of any other dungeon
[0:58:30] dontbeachad123: it has a super tight timer.
[0:58:32] Fraantic: quality of pugs is horrible this season
[0:58:33] Matus1k: i have all dungs 24/25 and rise 20 :(
[0:58:33] Sebleh: wait what debuff did they stoneform?
[0:58:36] Fraantic: legit disgusting
[0:58:46] wulfgang71: is there wow drops?
[0:58:50] dontbeachad123: thats why not as much a difficulty issue.

[0:59:22] tea2468: hi everyone!
[0:59:23] Fraantic: 1 mistake = deplete
[0:59:33] Sebleh: I’m guessing they stoneformed immediately and the debuffs got double popped for too much aoe damage on the group

[1:02:13] Sebleh: @fraantic battlefield is awful
[1:02:15] gameaddictz: was in a group the other day when I was getting yelled at for not dispelling them both immediately. I was like well..my dispel is. 10 sec cd so there’s that and also help with the afflicted if you want dispelled lol

[1:02:41] Sebleh: at least in the 23s you can tell before you even go into the arena if people are going to fuck up baits.
[1:03:11] Sebleh: battlefield is the faction boss
[1:03:12] tropicoxo: every boss in rise is garbage especially as a caster
[1:03:21] tropicoxo: all the mechanics are just run
[1:03:23] Andersonmps: Morchie is the worst imo
[1:03:30] goldenharpbilly: I was in a 22 that insisted we don't dispel afflicted because we could LOS it... we were in EB which basically has zero LOS
[1:03:32] Reloe: everyone that shittalks doesn't know soooo
[1:03:49] Ephires: hey naguura , do you maybe know why EB endboss sometimes takes forever? Last time on +27 fight took 7mins and Ive seen comps with aug kill it in 5mins

[1:07:00] Mattdaemun: "One cup of chai from the powdered form has 25 to 55mg of caffeine while in the concentrate, it's more likely to be 30 to 35mg"
[1:07:07] DukeBaphomet: natural caffeine its recommended to drink one cup of tea in the morning

[1:15:47] hackiii: monkaS
[1:16:05] SenorTostada: For real though, when I had long hair I washed my hair once a week,max. CBA to waste 2,5 hours doing that multiple times a week.
[1:16:10] popCatter: ive been in group finder for an hour so far
[1:16:13] popCatter: so its going great
[1:16:13] OffBeatOddity: monthly shower Bedge

[1:16:39] TotallyNotRaien: really? ususally straight hair cant go that long without a wash
[1:16:41] SenorTostada: Your head gets used to it too. People use way to much shampoo anyway
[1:16:45] hackiii: if you wash hair often it gets oily very quickly
[1:16:52] skyesarrow: she removed the sinks in her house so she doesn’t have to wash her hair
[1:16:52] scarletsiskiyou: you shouldn't wash it that much i do maybe twice a week if i work out
[1:16:55] Zoraija22: same, once a week but bc sensitiv scalp
[1:17:01] hackiii: if you wash em less they dont get oily that much
[1:17:05] heda80085: as a woman with short hair i think it's easier to wash it in the sink than longer hair. i guess it depends on the size of the sink haha
[1:17:21] scarletsiskiyou: i brush my hair a lot which helps move the oils down
[1:17:26] Mai4rt: true information
[1:17:28] hackiii: nah it gets itchy after 2 days
[1:17:31] JohnAllenCasts: skull oil, that's definitely a beard care product I'll bet
[1:17:36] maybehhhh: @Mai4rt its not but dont let that stop you
[1:17:44] Scoops__: it just depends on how fast your hair gets oily its different for everyone
[1:18:01] scarletsiskiyou: if you want healthy shiny strong hair wash it less brush it more
[1:18:22] maybehhhh: @Scoops__ exactly, it's like saying that people with oily skin and acne shouldnt wash their faces that often. people's skin is different and so is scalp skin, some get oily faster than others
[1:18:22] scarletsiskiyou: plus dry shampoo helps with oily hair to train it
[1:18:24] hackiii: dont believe her chat, gamer hair is always oili naguuraGiggle

[2:47:14] camcazy: you could use them as an advocate though
[2:47:51] Sebleh: i guess it depends on the contract but I’m pretty sure it’s all or nothing on your buildout for the electricians already contracted.
[2:48:09] spizynoodle: this is why I married an electrician KEKW
[2:49:23] Sebleh: oh gotcha. I misunderstood. sounds possible tbh but the first electrician would have to account for it.
[2:49:44] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:49:47] Ren26: what does car honking mean
[2:50:07] Lifegourd: i bet your ask the first electrician if he wants that work or if he's swamped. then use your uncles maybe
[2:50:11] SteveMK: you're stressing me out repair you gear
[2:50:14] Sebleh: first electrician would have to provide any additional circuit breakers in the panels and conduits/risers up to your apartment in the building.
[2:53:09] HotdawgBoy: if they dont do the electrician work, they shouldnt get the money
[2:53:45] HotdawgBoy: its accrued work that is never taken care of, so you would think a legitimate company would not take money for work they didnt do
[2:54:25] camcazy: so you dont have an option on who does the work they choose everyone. see you should have an option about who does what work

[2:54:45] Arubicon: the organization doing the build is the prime contractor and those doing the other stuff( electrical, plumbing etc) are sub contractors..a place will be built off blue prints..you can get changes done in them if reasonable before build passes the stage of where your changes take place
[2:55:44] greacher_: can druid dispell tank on last boss inthrone?
[2:55:54] camcazy: ok yes i got it now though someone else i got it

[2:56:21] fennrirq: farewell the apartment KEKHeim
[2:56:33] camcazy: yea its not like its your house its an apartment
[2:56:36] Arubicon: yeah..the company doing the build has the say on who is used..you can ask for extra from say the electrical crew but it will cost..and its easier to do during the build than after the fact
[2:56:40] Sebleh: @greacher_ Druids can only dispel poison and curses, if you’re resto then magic too
[2:57:44] JimeTV: is boomy strong for mm+ ?
[2:58:35] HotdawgBoy: they run a lot of credit, so they have a lot of creditors calling

[3:24:55] Zenamos72: if the evoker is good yes but most of them in lower keys are just not good
[3:24:57] Sebleh: but you absolutely don’t need the damage there’s like zero damage checks in the season
[3:25:07] R3w4s: aug evokers in lower keys are so weird sometimes you get a god and sometimes you get a infalted aug that ints keys for living
[3:25:07] Mr_Espresso_Bean: so it's get an aug who doesn't know how to play aug or at least get another dps who can at least provide dps

[4:24:14] Kuroz: ye but for example the bleed that you added manually was showing, so it had to be something they changed in the default module setting
