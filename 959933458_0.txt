[0:21:10] GFiTV: no lol. streamers have invites alrdy
[0:21:15] MrGattz: @SpidercowSD because classic and tbc classic are now running on the new BFA game engine rather than the old one. so shits broken that needs to be fixed
[0:21:27] CritcobainTV: @GFiTV Check the twitter post tho? lore said it wasn't supposed to be sent out yet

[0:24:33] Vexxsis: it's fake, tbc is fake also Kappa
[0:24:34] Genilort: patch dosent make sense
[0:24:35] BlueBeast33: Classic was 1.13, so 2.5 for TBC Beta isn't a surprise
[0:24:35] MrGattz: @Stringerrs no lol not for a while
[0:24:36] Stringerrs: the beta i mean
[0:24:40] CritcobainTV: @GN_Paradox calm down broseph
[0:24:45] GN_Paradox: tbc is happening but wether that is today or tommorow

[0:25:54] B3rgh: I dont think they will do beta without acualy giving an announcment
[0:25:56] Tigerklaue: i care more about 9.1 ptr than bc beta
[0:25:56] BlueBeast33: How is 2.5.1 wrong

[0:26:10] secondarych: shadowlands LUL

[0:26:39] grapyz: I heard the beta is coming out sometime in 2007!!
[0:26:42] mkooodooo: welcome HOME
[0:26:59] BlueBeast33: Again, they called Classic 1.13 even though they ran it off of 1.12 - because it had some minor additions, 2.5.1 for TBC makes sense
[0:27:13] Â§™ÈôΩ„ÇíÈ£ü„Åπ„Çã‰∫∫„Ç§„Ç´„É´„Çπ: the  possible store mount  in TBC classic looks  neat

[1:30:58] Rexialiton: @esteradd It's a WA from Luxthos
[1:31:01] legobind: they need raid testing to make sure its not like classic
[1:31:03] Mitune: arena and raid
[1:31:05] tallishgamer: you can clear SM at 30 no problem...
[1:31:19] Cramer: Yeah they did finally do Naxx testing in classic but no other raids except ZG/AQ20, so hopefully they continue the trend they started with Naxx
[1:31:26] SonofHorus82: I think my only chance to get into the beta is either vicariously or if they do stress tests like they did during classic beta.
[1:31:34] vikingjason: yeah I think i'll skip trying to clear ARM/Cath at 30
[1:31:34] alex_mograine: i never understood why they released nerfed bosses in classic
[1:31:35] vikingjason: kek

[2:06:47] Stonefather: 2.5m
[2:06:48] gargakan: 2.5 m
[2:06:48] Nurama: 2.5m
[2:06:49] Wildside1177: 2.5 mil
[2:06:50] CritcobainTV: but how many of them dont even watch twitch? LUL
[2:06:56] WayneG947: at least a big mac anyway
[2:06:57] Funderik: that could very well be old people that don't know what twitch are though.
[2:07:00] sliizew: 2,5 million dollars wasted DansGame
[2:07:03] dimofodi: Of those 500k people are boomers who don't even know Twitch exists?
[2:07:04] Venkxx: does this count people who dont even have a twitch account?
[2:07:06] Nurama: @critcobain It would be unused on twitch.
[2:07:08] Lazugo: Hello mr T happy to see the cam again
[2:07:12] sphynx_rayne: I forget about it all the time till someone bring it up[
[2:07:12] fewyn: i've forgotten to use it a few times because it's not super obvious i have it available
[2:07:22] maalow: many people don't watch twitch
[2:07:23] Nurama: @Venkxx You think that only 500k people dont have twitch accounts? :P
[2:07:25] Honvar: @towelliee does your PC sponsor ship to Europe or do they have stores in the EU?
[2:07:30] fewyn: also i'm subbed to most people i watch
[2:07:30] A_New_Challenger: I am guessing it is leaned up against only twitch users that have prime

[2:07:35] Sincline387: think of how many people that have prime and don't ever go to twitch at all let alone long enough to sub to someone
[2:07:39] k_randals: k_randals subscribed with Prime. 
[2:07:40] CritcobainTV: @SpiffyBandit my point is that if you pay for amazon prime, that doesn't mean u watch twitch. Like my sister, she orders things on amazon but has no idea about twitch
[2:07:49] kungkaj: Loved your opinion on shadowlands, thanks
[2:07:51] Stonefather: #SomeChanges? DKs in BC let's go! Keepo
[2:07:56] Venkxx: I dont know :D
[2:08:03] TelleThomas: were you in DJ during original tbc?
[2:08:06] othraerir: ooo sounds spicy, will have to watch it
[2:08:07] k_randals: @towelliee I wish prime auto renewed... I just always forget about it.
[2:08:11] Kromede: ion smash SMOrc
[2:08:12] Vance: That Shadowlands video kinda hit different, summed up a lot of things I don't like about SL without me knowing the exact reason
[2:08:18] GhostShaman: Well to be fair If they would add that free sub option into the mobile app they would get more uses out of it
[2:08:23] A_New_Challenger: That sub animation is something serious! Looks really great! - Did you miss it? I know how you can see it again :)
[2:08:24] CDubTheRIPper: saurfang PepeHands

[2:08:31] snowmang94: @towelliee bought the new mic, free one day shipping let's goooo
[2:08:33] Nurama: @critcobain Yes and you are assuming only 500k people are amazon prime users who dont have twitch? no its twitch accounts with prime capabilities that didnt use it
[2:08:35] Stonefather: To be fair, Saurfang was a traitor.
[2:08:35] SlayerLightStorm: towLul
[2:08:40] crashoverride_gaming: Lol speak the truth @towelliee!!!!!
[2:08:47] laughing_octopus: sad but true
[2:08:48] byrdeen45: i do like bfa over shadowlands
[2:08:53] SlayerLightStorm: @Stonefather BONK!

[2:09:15] TelleThomas: personally loving shadowlands
[2:09:19] AureliusXV: ppl hop on the train alot with wow
[2:09:26] A_New_Challenger: I really am enjoying shadowlands, but my one thing that is really holding me back from doing what I want is this anima drought...it is keeping me from playing alts
[2:09:31] Vance: It's crazy that the most active players in my guild all miss BFA
[2:09:32] Amarlian: I agree with you and I feel like it's all fixable @Towelliee
[2:09:37] Zeakon92: are we talking shit about SL ?
[2:09:38] Catspaw66: Towel's youtube assessment of shadowlands was on point. several sound byte moments in the video . Great vid Towel , cheers
[2:09:41] Honvar: Hi @towelliee does your PC sponsor ship to Europe or do they have stores in the EU?
[2:09:41] Biorrwolf: Disenchanted?

[2:09:42] Whitemamba236: what do you think specificaly is wrong??
[2:09:42] Mitune: It just feels too much of the same
[2:09:44] ShadoodHD: ... disappointed?
[2:09:46] forcegamerrr: I feel you!
[2:09:47] GeekInParadise: apathetic
[2:09:52] Frostfury: Your face Kreygasm
[2:09:56] Quakezilla69: I am having a blastwith shadowlands, but I am tired of how annoying gearing is for my alts
[2:10:01] A_New_Challenger: I'm working on the rogue campaign :)
[2:10:02] TheFabilolz: I'm glad i quit Retail :)
[2:10:02] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i didn't even do a key on my rogue this week, I'm so disenchanted with retail. being 225 and not having a guild that has a solid roster for raiding, it makes me not want to do anything, i have nothing to push for
[2:10:07] mrsolo0: what do you think SL missing @Towelliee  ?
[2:10:12] sphynx_rayne: I just stop playing and went to play FF!4 :/
[2:10:13] Nurama: Thats how I felt about wow for YEARS now
[2:10:20] Frostfury: Hey I mean are you happy with SLG nerf? :P
[2:10:21] Zeakon92: Im not doing shiet atm in retail ...
[2:10:22] GhostShaman: I‚Äôm not enjoying it. I‚Äôm bored as shit. This time gate, grind rinse repeat bs has to stop.
[2:10:24] notdustinx: make more alts?

[2:10:35] Ssikwow: Play et in PvP and stomp
[2:10:36] daegoh: isnt this what guys like preach wanted?
[2:10:38] Wildside1177: Levelling this classic Lock is so much better than SL.
[2:10:40] PhillyRhino: Sounds about right. I haven't touched SL in about 3 weeks.
[2:10:42] Ssikwow: ret*
[2:10:44] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i've only done 3/10 mythic twice and im 225. I literally have nothing to do for gear
[2:10:55] kungkaj: Stop being so pro, join us noobs
[2:10:57] Zigra1: my KSM and PVP spider mount
[2:10:59] shrektard69: im ilvl 207 lol
[2:10:59] Deadelus0: I'm working on my first alt :-)
[2:11:03] Getitonthelow: not me fuk ksm
[2:11:05] Leafylockx: saame, only 3 way i can get any up at this point is either get lucky with vault with slg/sire loot or actually sire/slg
[2:11:07] Jokervenom1978: lol i havent killed heroic Donny yet

[2:11:11] Triist0ne: great to have classic for these situations
[2:11:20] AureliusXV: so what youre saying is you want titanforging back....ahhahha @Towelliee
[2:11:20] byrdeen45: Shadowlands is boring
[2:11:22] GhostShaman: And I‚Äôm sorry mythic+ is not a substitute for raising progression. Having to wait for one raid per content patch is just fucking stupid.
[2:11:22] all_beef_franks: I used to play really hard, I was top 150 US guild... now that im just casual and play after work, i feel i enjoy having things to do, but i do miss the raiding with friends
[2:11:26] Wildside1177: IT is worse than that Toweliee. I have only cleared Heroic and I am done. Only raiding is fun.
[2:11:29] A_New_Challenger: Yup - I am the daily casual player...so like I play a lot, but I don't do a lot of high level group content so it is still hanging there for me...what you are saying makes a lot of sense
[2:11:31] Chasery: I mean isn't that what we were all complaining about? The endless hammster wheel?
[2:11:32] forcegamerrr: 200+ is just horrible for me as well
[2:11:33] RogueBear: i mythic raid but i dont raid on my alts so i still have stuff i can do. it just feels like shit trying to do it
[2:11:36] Biorrwolf: !tbc

[2:11:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: im at a point where i just want to know the story farming retail just isnt fun to me anymore
[2:11:38] mangoboi: @Towelliee isnt that a reason to do the grind tho?
[2:11:39] Meakis: I believe blizzard is building stuff from a wrong mindset. They want ppl to play as much as possible and put in a lot of daily stuff to do. Emisaries, Maw, Raids, Duneons and Thorghast. It's nice to have it all, but you need to do all of it for decent upgrades.  It used to be you got a daily quest or 4-5 in relevant zone ( maw now ? ) and you are free to do your shit. Now you gotta travel all over man...
[2:12:02] gargakan: i find it more worth it to lvl and farm gold in classic right now
[2:12:04] crashoverride_gaming: Yeah I am grinding my Alta out but like you said yesterday with the valor... shit needs to change
[2:12:04] SonofHorus82: I took a month off from Classic to play Shadowlands and I wish I hadn't because now I'm super far behind on being geared up for raid. Also, lvl 60 Paladin that DOESNT have his epic charger mount.
[2:12:16] Funderik: alot people said there was too much gear
[2:12:20] Zeakon92: cleared heroic Dena about 2months ago, and now we dont have much to do, cuz 90% of the guild doesn¬¥t wanna push mythic so ..  + I got lik 5 alts , just cant get myself to gearing them "alot" atm, its just.. meh.. Just tired of it
[2:12:26] jeneraljelly: @SonofHorus82 i did the same man and i regret it also..

[2:12:54] SlapaH03: i sstarted farming gold LUL
[2:12:57] SlayerLightStorm: My Hunter on retail is 200, haven't done any Mythic+, just Normal raids, been doing Trial of Style. That's it.
[2:13:14] luckfore: SL sucks massive dick
[2:13:19] AureliusXV: you werent the first
[2:13:22] Kromede: but you have to, 9.0.5 drought
[2:13:23] TheFabilolz: I'm glad i quit Retail :)
[2:13:28] Naturalbeef: There's definitely something missing in Retail but I can't explain what it is
[2:13:32] killfrenzyyy: AngelThump
[2:13:39] Triist0ne: yeah got ksm, cleared mythic and then glad for pvp and man im DONE

[2:13:46] Nurama: The games almost 20 years old, it makes sense.
[2:13:46] CrusaderNero: SL? Got the same feeling as with WoD. So not good. At ALL
[2:13:51] Red_Dead_Redeem: It's a mixed bag depending on what you prefer and want to do
[2:13:55] Frostfury: There is me still playing retail without being bored and still sitting on 225 on my pally but progressing council now :(
[2:14:02] cowee12356995: longer than HFC patch??
[2:14:05] crabhimself: they should of had more than one raid this teir
[2:14:06] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: it was so promising
[2:14:08] AureliusXV: sl is fine
[2:14:09] Khlaro: I've just been leveling classes to 60. That's where I get my enjoyment in retail. duckKekw

[2:14:27] Blackplaguee: no chance a short patch will drop between?
[2:14:27] WhiteKnight74648: I'm not feeling Shadowlands honestly. I got motivated to try out monk this expansion as an alt.  As soon as i got to 60 i stopped playing him.  I dont want to go through all the chores to make him viable. i just want to play the content i enjoy.
[2:14:28] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Yo, but what if they release a selfie camera? POGGERS
[2:14:32] majinmeww: Also I don‚Äôt think anyone asked for no alt catchup mechanics. Why can‚Äôt we get soul ash from other activities? Not everyone likes doing torghast as a chore every week
[2:14:33] Red_Dead_Redeem: WOD Sucked
[2:14:37] boopbopbamski: fine Kappa
[2:14:45] gears_vet: shadowlands is garbage
[2:14:47] Layercake: Limiting the quantity of gear we get and not having valor at the beginning was only to extent players playtime because the rest of all the systems/features are half baked.
[2:14:49] Nezza1124: it not like its their fualt though. we have to give them some kind of break. ther is a global pandemic
[2:14:50] swordwindgaming: WoD was sabotaged midway through.
[2:14:50] GhostShaman: Well that and the flying debacle lol
[2:14:51] love_eggplant: how come they are delaying content so hard?
[2:14:52] Styhllish: Sadge castle nathria
[2:14:58] Zeakon92: its getting pretty stale for sure..
[2:15:01] jerexify: Hence why I'm leveling in Classic for the first time since it released.
[2:15:02] Kromede: 4D version critcobain POGGERS
[2:15:03] luckfore: it already feels like were in the draught we usually have at the end of expanions
[2:15:07] TelleThomas: 9.1 will be in like mid late may
[2:15:10] Varinius: Im just leveling new chars in classic
[2:15:12] Ezekyler: KEKW
[2:15:13] Quakezilla69: I think they could dial down M difficulty and bump the loot up in some hot fixes. M+ shouldnt be stressful. and it is. I miss m+ in legion
[2:15:15] AureliusXV: all i do is raid and my 14s and im fine with it lol plenty of stuff to do
[2:15:17] spanij: spanij subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! @Towelliee good morning
[2:15:21] Zeakon92: fianlly Towelliee is not defending blizz, yaaay
[2:15:24] crashoverride_gaming: But COVID, I mean that‚Äôs why shadowlands isn‚Äôt the way blizzard wanted it........
[2:15:27] Zeakon92: finally*
[2:15:28] Aktz_: AT THE START of the expasion
[2:15:28] SonofHorus82: @critcobain I would actually LOVE something new for my Selfie cam. A Selfie stick addition would be great.
[2:15:36] Leafylockx: also class design is so uninteresting for the most part imo i literally have 0 will to play any alts besdies my SP
[2:15:38] Varinius: like I got my bug mount and cleared naxx so nothing left to do except level profession alts for TBC KEKW
[2:15:40] LefttOverCereal: 9 whole months
[2:15:55] CrusaderNero: 9 months for first patch is horrendous
[2:15:57] Kinghorn: you dont want to do 15 minute qorld quests for 35 anima?
[2:15:58] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Selfie cam update? Selfie stick? POGGERS
[2:16:01] Kinghorn: qorld*
[2:16:03] Chuzzles93: there's the anima conductor
[2:16:03] CritcobainTV: @SonofHorus82 good idea
[2:16:13] Chasery: Agreed, the spacing of content feels off. Usually at this point in the expansion, I would be pushing the final mythic bosses and feeling the pressure to complete it before the next raid comes out
[2:16:14] Genilort: great classic lol
[2:16:14] Kinghorn: I cant type, need more coffee
[2:16:19] Kromede: pepe mount POGGERS
[2:16:21] Mathhbm: CLASSIC BUGS lul
[2:16:24] luckfore: 9 whole months without new content at the begin of a new expac. yikes.
[2:16:27] sliizew: that exact mob is  bugged on every server LUL
[2:16:28] AureliusXV: so youre saying you want titanforging back so you can get upgrades?
[2:16:31] Zeakon92: This is abit like WoD , all over again xD  abit .
[2:16:36] Divine_Miscreant: I wasn't opted in for BC Beta and it was available for download last night....I verified I wasn't by going to the page and opting in and now the BC beta  is gone ..I tried doing a search but nothing came up..sorry if  you already talked about this
[2:16:40] Aervyper: @Towelliee you think Outriders will be good or bad?
[2:16:45] k_randals: @towelliee The content drought sucks the guild I am in pretty much disbanded from wow. Some went to FF14 some just stopped playing shit all together.
[2:16:55] Ficup: !addon
[2:16:56] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK.

[2:17:01] Mathhbm: @Towelliee what you think about the possible mount store for TBC Classic?
[2:17:02] othraerir: you get to farm anima, enjoy
[2:17:02] gears_vet: classic was never about the end game, classic is about beating the end game, getting the best gear and then destroying people in wpvp while making gold in the open world in different ways
[2:17:03] shrektard69: i could leave have a baby and come back
[2:17:09] TheFabilolz: Retail andys must be malding hard
[2:17:09] CapusoR: any official reason for such a long period without a patch?
[2:17:19] Red_Dead_Redeem: WOD worst x-pack IMO and cata is also there too
[2:17:29] Layercake: I killed heroic donny and peace out 1 month and half in the expansion, no way i'm going to farm pointless gear and do the maw/thorghast for nothing.
[2:17:30] Chasery: God, has it really been that long? haha
[2:17:38] Logabrick: does SoO count? or do you really mean between patches of an expac?
[2:17:39] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee with a patch draught like that, are we about to have like a 3 year expansion? KEKW
[2:17:41] Triist0ne: Pog
[2:17:46] Zeakon92: tbc <3
[2:17:47] Gapz: @Towelliee guess you can always blame covid as an excuse
[2:17:48] pukeeyyy: bc poggers
[2:17:49] Genilort: d2 alpha
[2:17:49] Triist0ne: bc is gonna be so fun man
[2:17:50] S1appadabass: it is in fact, my cup of tea
[2:17:52] AureliusXV: im good with that, already beat tbc
[2:17:57] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee normally, we'd all be leveling alts around this time - but that alt gearing grind is BRUTAL
[2:18:02] FluskB: TBC is gonna be sooo fun :)
[2:18:02] ILikeKillTheZombies: its good that i dont play only wow, so i have other games to enjoy
[2:18:06] jerexify: @Towelliee Do you think there's enough time between now and BC release to level again in Classic?
[2:18:10] pukeeyyy: you reckon june for full bc release?
[2:18:14] SlayerLightStorm: How do you check if you're opted in to the beta?
[2:18:14] Getitonthelow: welp imma just level up my new main gear out and go play my long backlog of games on switch and pc
[2:18:15] Triist0ne: my man theotar here
[2:18:16] mab_music_ttrpg: 9.1 later than june ? omg. no one will play by then
[2:18:18] WhiteKnight74648: @Redemption004 WoD had a pvp system i really enjoyed. enough for me to make multiple alts and gear them to enjoy it. Raids were fun to.  WoD was more my playstyle over bfa
[2:18:18] mangoboi: @Towelliee so I am playing SL after playing classic after a while, is it worth playing?
[2:18:21] Aervyper: @Towelliee but twisting corridors has a transmog, title, pet and mount THAT"S EPIC
[2:18:24] NewWorldReign: How was Lulas chicken last night, it looked beautiful on her cooking stream
[2:18:39] SSD511_: Welcome back @towelliee
[2:18:43] tripl3heart: in prepatch u wanna make gold lol
[2:18:46] Mathhbm: Pre patch possible comes with 30% exp boost
[2:18:48] jerexify: @Towelliee Cool. I'm 17 now, so I was hoping to get to 60 before BC released.
[2:18:55] Crowargus: is there an exp buff in prepatch?
[2:18:55] MrTrebs: just play fall guys
[2:18:56] Red_Dead_Redeem: @WhiteKnight74648 I respect that, but for me it was just horrible
[2:18:57] xenomath: what is that XP tracker ?
[2:19:05] WhiteKnight74648: @Redemption004 understandable.

[2:22:56] Harch: wotlk
[2:23:10] MrEvilRex: Aye TowelCam, how you doing Towelliee?
[2:23:11] Thoreya: that would be fucking lame lol
[2:23:12] Dixietwist: @Towelliee  so in theory u could boost a ally pally and then faction change to horde
[2:23:21] Tempuren: there is no way
[2:23:23] Wulfgrym: that excludes the new playersw
[2:23:24] dabinsky: There are a lot of people who didnt play classic but would love to play BC so they will not do that
[2:23:26] Manabucho: Why would they limit their own sales xD
[2:23:30] KingTunaSalad: They obviously dont care about the bots.
[2:23:30] vrxd: Okey, nice guess i fell for the rumors ^^
[2:23:31] CritcobainTV: That would make no sense, their whole reasoning in the FAQ was that they wanted to have a way for new players to get into it
[2:23:33] Tempuren: they said they wanted boost to be for ppl that didnt play classic
[2:23:33] Red_Dead_Redeem: they could, but since you are using money...that comes before leveling
[2:23:35] Stonefather: Any thing is possible like pigs flying, doesn't mean it's going to happen though.
[2:23:35] 00Nikh: they are not gonna put a stipulation on taking your money, lol
[2:23:36] swordwindgaming: Needing a level 60 is not going to help the hype. They want people to buy in, sub back up, and try TBC classic.

[2:23:51] CDubTheRIPper: danHmm
[2:23:57] Phootacular: Their target demographic for the boost is players interested in TBC that didn't play vanilla, so requiring a level 60 doesn't fit
[2:24:14] Stonefather: I get messaged like twice a week in Classic from just reporting players who I believe are botting.
[2:24:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: they just need to monitor boosted character a little harder for the first few days if they appear to be bots ban them and keep their money
[2:24:16] Sincline387: or add in wow tokens and the bot problem minimizes itself
[2:24:18] Contendedlemon: well they just laid off alot of people so im sure they have vacancy lol

[2:24:21] SlapaH03: blizz spending money LUL
[2:24:22] Red_Dead_Redeem: they need to crack down hardcore on bots, but not getting my hopes up
[2:24:22] belfastcl: blizz has always been lenient with the bot situation
[2:24:23] yerdlethespaceturtle: please god no
[2:24:39] Stonefather: I think I've gotten over twenty messages from Blizzard for thanking me reporting people who got actioned
[2:24:41] tedol: this one way
[2:24:48] oJNelly: Just make an anti cheat multi billion dollar company
[2:24:50] pipboy733: there are tons of bots in retail
[2:24:52] Stonefather: So they definitely ban them at least temporarily
[2:24:57] grumpybearsx: The bots have killed the economy, they need to do something for the people that enjoy the game.
[2:24:57] Mitune: if you want to know how hard bots are the get rid of look up how advanced some bots are in ORSR
[2:24:58] HansMacau: a 50000 usd AI would decimate bots before they would ever reach lvl 60
[2:25:01] MOLAR305: getting rid of bots is like getting rid of steroids in sports. the cheaters are always ahead of detection
[2:25:05] Mitune: OSRS*
[2:25:07] Kinghorn: activision spending money KEKWlaugh
[2:25:11] Aktz_: i guess i should start botting... then they will go hard on it KEKW

[2:28:50] zenFX_: @At1c Microsoft can't code good programs. They can make an okay OS, but they can't do programs worth shit, and that's kind of sad when you built the fucking OS that the program runs on. Like, seriously... what's wrong with you?

[2:30:30] Papfar: skullflame shield is a bait
[2:30:38] CritcobainTV: @sybilo yes, the 2,000g limit is only if you pay for a server transfer to a new realm
[2:30:50] CritcobainTV: You keep all the gold on your server as long as you don't move
[2:31:03] kiviroo: oki <3
[2:31:15] Red_Dead_Redeem: there is no capping, but there is plenty of Kappa
[2:31:31] TheSpace_Sloth: how would you transfer the 2k to your horde toon though there isnt a faction change in classic is there? I guess you could use the neutral AH
[2:31:48] Mitune: I wouldnt put it past them to do one or two fresh servers unless they have said otherwise
[2:32:04] mulletrocker11358: 2k bottle of water lol

[2:33:52] CritcobainTV: @pipboy733 more like 500-600k
[2:33:57] Stonefather: Technically it is RMT only in that you can buy WoW tokens with gold Keepo
[2:34:04] Stonefather: Er money
[2:34:07] SinicalDev: A wow token goes for about 850gold on classic
[2:34:10] SinicalDev: EU

[2:34:21] MrGattz: that seems wrong
[2:34:22] Mitune: inflation is real
[2:34:24] pipboy733: trading*
[2:34:24] ProClicker: 500 gold=$15
[2:34:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe these world first guilds should have people farming classic gold for retail gold Kappa
[2:34:31] MrGattz: so 1k gold classic is like 4 months of gametime?

[3:05:46] ninedraft317: i think shadowlands would be better if covid was not around
[3:05:47] Zeakon92: @Towelliee i ment wod - bfa - sl so far, but legion came after wod so it was " the last 3 "
[3:05:50] Frostfury: Time to see 6/6 upgrades on Sloot again LUL
[3:06:09] SonofHorus82: @ninedraft317 if covid wasnt around we would already be well into 9.1 so yes.
[3:06:10] Zeakon92: Legion was good tho
[3:06:12] Avinar: I like more shit to do in the open world not just world quests
[3:06:14] DoubleNova: they regressed?
[3:06:18] PhillyDilly18: I was told there would be no math
[3:06:25] Avinar: legion I liked in ways but hated alts in it
[3:06:25] Sniped23: Check world dragon spawn
[3:06:26] dreioo: basic maffs
[3:06:26] DwarfWarrior25: ok so in your opinion how many more expansions/ years do you think world of warcraft has before they pull the plug in that they will not release any more expansions/content ???
[3:06:27] mtgswt: i think either removing titanforging or changing up m+ how they did would have been acceptable gearing strat changes

[3:06:30] SSD511_: Shadowlands atm is 227 players one shot low gear players in the bgs
[3:06:36] smashinu187: I just dont understand why they cant drop loot and give us the god damn vendors.. like the valor system sucks.. it fixed nothing for me.

[3:07:20] ninedraft317: @SonofHorus82  i total agree

[3:07:31] Eziak: I agree his word isn‚Äôt gospel, but yours isn‚Äôt either.
[3:07:35] Avinar: yea it's like wod. wod was great for gameplay, raiding, and pvp sucked for a lot of others

[3:08:56] ZombieXIII: yeah gears easy its what to do the rest of the time what is the issue you can get fresh 60-215-220 in a week
[3:09:04] Cafe0le: @zaraine1 the start of legion fucking amazing we got two extra mythic dungeons, 1 mega dungeon in kara and a mini raid in a very short span of time (plus more suramar for casuals)

[3:09:55] Genilort: when bfa was better than sl haahaahaha
[3:10:01] bruhSit_farmer: its good news for tbc classic tbh all casuals will flock to it
[3:10:02] K0rzak0v: Kul Tiras and Zandalar way better than Shadowlands areas
[3:10:05] ch0ller: Went EFT with some TBC in between soon SeemsGood
[3:10:06] Waspire: which bow is it?
[3:10:11] LazyDynamics: arent those numbers normal for an expansion launch?
[3:10:13] Nutqase: for me the worst expansion was legion and that was when i quit wow forever
[3:10:16] vyjinx: slutfist LUL
[3:10:25] Jakosin: what addon is that at the top?
[3:10:25] FalconBroadcasting: until SL improves, I agree. BfA > SL. BfA had some shit, but the core gameplay loop was undisturbed and fun for the most part (until 8.3)
[3:10:25] faulen: MSFT opened UP $2.5 to the moon!
[3:10:27] othraerir: easier for melee
[3:10:39] Justarandomman: Great vault actually only reason i play, good addition .. but for every 1 good decision they do 20 bad ones
[3:10:43] Sygfreid: Shadowlands is the first expansion where I lost all interest within a month.  Even BFA held my attention longer.
[3:10:44] Armdel: nothing to really grind besides gear and that grind has roof where you can't really go futher without being stupidly lucky
[3:10:54] elbinn: I just got here so sorry if this was said - but its funny that Sludge was nerfed when Elitist Jerks has been progging on it for 21 days according to WoWProgress
[3:10:54] toobaked1987: F
[3:10:59] toobaked1987: the reverb

[3:12:07] mrpresbaby: dude his companions are like level 100
[3:12:08] ShadoodHD: WutFace
[3:12:12] Catspaw66: I want to get into horde classic. but outside of cow druid. or an Orc Shaman. Everything else I'd rather play class wise feels better with a blood elf. Bad take ?

[3:15:04] themaliciousrabbit: @elbinn I mean there will be sharding... But probably not that great. I'm planning on just doing dungeon runs.. Get XP, gear, and rep so when I hit 70 i'll be geared and have some reps out of the way
[3:15:05] Kinghorn: arcane wrath wont sell
[3:15:10] Iolgz: @towelliee I sold one of those for 70g on EU just over a week ago
[3:15:12] Kinghorn: dont waste the deposit
[3:15:35] Cafe0le: pvp is fun af now and its all that matters, the problem is the power difference between geared characters and fresh alts on the ladder, the power creep is insane
[3:15:35] laito_: I wish class design was still good bro, damn what've done these years, seems like they can't improve it anymore... guess we'll have to wait for old expansions to be re-released xD
[3:15:36] Sygfreid: Can't wait for the Hellfire NPCs to get camped again.
[3:15:37] syphergod89: glad to see your face again
[3:15:50] iceman2kx: what website was he just using anyone know?
[3:16:02] elbinn: @HGYordle Yeah I think the lag intensity in Hellfire will encourage more people to dungeon grind that might not have. I personally am going to quest normally even though I know its not the fastest

[3:16:42] Dixietwist: @Towelliee  for profs , like elemental LW
[3:16:56] themaliciousrabbit: @elbinn Yeah i prefer questing, but with how everything will be standards blizzard rates, the rep grind at 70 will be intense. So if you can get a lot of it out of the way early while leveling it will be a huge speed up

[3:35:37] tripl3heart: 200% chance u pay for it yes
[3:35:39] Eronius: isnt the point of remaking the expansion fixing the stupid shit they couldnt back then and adding new stuff. if you dont like the boosts or other paid shit then dont use them
[3:35:40] TweakT: everything @Bakuryuha96

[3:35:48] TheAverageGoob: Oh haha, I just realized you are back on cam! So good to see you @Towelliee :D
[3:35:49] Quakezilla69: how long are servers down today
[3:35:52] gears_vet: @Eronius no
[3:35:53] MrYody: you can keep both as a paid service
[3:35:54] dream_boxing: Good morning Towelliee and chat! Glad to see the cam back. towHi
[3:35:55] mavericks312: @Vexxsis and it should be i hated vanilla leveling but ill pay to place in tbc with the boost
[3:36:01] broopyd: @Biby07 no, you start with 1 and you end up with 2. thats a clone
[3:36:01] gears_vet: keep the retail shit in retail
[3:36:02] Bakuryuha96: @TweakT oh you're one of those people ok. I'm not even gonna keep this going
[3:36:02] GoodBoy955: @quakezilla69 1 hr
[3:36:03] themaliciousrabbit: Yeah they already announced that you can pay to have your character on both vanilla and TBC. otherwise its one or the other
[3:36:04] Holysal: the kicker is all the ppl complain will buy all mtx lol
[3:36:07] MrGattz: @HaxzorJimDuggan neither can most people. classic will be just about as dead as it will get once tbc launches
[3:36:09] SilkeySmooth: why pay to raid maxx forever?
[3:36:15] Twankiez1992: dude without the "no changes" and private server crowd there wouldn't BE a classic retail WoW at all. There are thousands that put their love of the game and pressure onto blizzard to make it. lol
[3:36:17] MrYody: otherwise you lose it sending it to the vanilla versions
[3:36:27] hushhp: Beta is actually today?
[3:36:27] Vexxsis: @mavericks312 indeed , everyone benefits from it
[3:36:35] jackjonesiii: give me BC now
[3:36:42] saitama8: the all reason classic is exist is to give you the closest feel to what it was back in the day tho... with all its scuffness..
[3:36:43] gears_vet: im honestly thinking about staying on vanilla cuz of the boost
[3:36:52] BraerHZ: seal of blood changes was BIG pog for me
[3:36:53] rambaldi00: no maint on classic server today?
[3:36:54] broopyd: do you still think it will be challenging with 2.3 classes though @Towelliee
[3:36:55] TheGaoSora: imagine if they'll allow to make a classic era clone to retail once WotlK classic is done Kappa
[3:37:01] Vexxsis: @gears_vet have fun
[3:37:02] Simmo_rs: Would it be hard fro someone to play TBc who never played classic? @Towelliee
[3:37:04] Hawkzerr: Pre-Patch being able to lvl BE Pally <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[3:37:05] NILLme: cant wait for tbc prepatch
[3:37:08] SonofHorus82: I am so pumped to do those attunements again. I love that shit.
[3:37:09] Twankiez1992: Do you really think vanilla classic is going to die? lol
[3:37:14] metavahn231: lul im against boost but will still be on TBC day 1
[3:37:21] Wildside1177: lol Zealots are funny
[3:37:24] flumw: being this mad about the boost is borderline mental illness
[3:37:25] GoodBoy955: only like 6 people per server will stay in vanilla KEKW
[3:37:28] Alitor1987: Check your launcher.. im downloading a Unknown game right now..
[3:37:35] Srdjan91: @Twankiez1992 yes same with tbc when wotlk comes out
[3:37:37] vocalpenguin: not gonna styart raiding naxx til classic era. naxx 4 lyfe bro
[3:37:38] Frosty1u1: pre nerf raids has me so hyped
[3:37:41] gears_vet: all the bots will wreck bc's economy by abusin the boost
[3:37:42] Thunderlops: I just want wrath
[3:37:49] flebbooo: Just watched your new video Towelliee and it was great! Appreciate u speaking out about the concerns of SL :) At this point i'm just raid logging aswell and can't find myself to do much else
[3:37:50] toobaked1987: @Towelliee would you rather they work and improve shadowlands systems or just move on to something else and end with at least a great story?
[3:37:51] TheGaoSora: it's vanilla no mater how you call it XD people wanted scuffed Pserver mobs, well too bad
[3:37:54] Kinghorn: call of duty 6 @Alitor1987 PogChamp
[3:37:56] Mitune: the unknown game is the beta files
[3:37:57] saitama8: @Towelliee Why you hating on the #nochange so much? just curious
[3:37:59] DoubleNova: When will Shadowlands Classic be?
[3:38:01] GoodBoy955: level 70 druid bots Pog
[3:38:01] kalovic_: I got to the server select screen in the beta client yesterday before they took it away
[3:38:02] notdiggz: List of Cons for Classic is like 10 to 1 for pros and i cant think of a single con for TBC
[3:38:03] Divine_Miscreant: My BC beta went away after I opted in
[3:38:04] ATV93: I want both vanilla and BC, since I only started playing now so I want to still.experience the vanilla content but will probably make a dranei pally for BC. best of both worlds!!! GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat
[3:38:04] SonofHorus82: I didnt download beta :(
[3:38:04] Grurim: @Twankiez1992 Anyone who thinks the "no changes" crowd is why Classic happened does not understand business. WoW was not the first game to try a re-release, nor will it be the last, and it was all about money, not pleasing a few peeps.
[3:38:05] notdiggz: its such a better game
[3:38:07] Twankiez1992: @Twankiez1992 dude, there were THOUSANDS that played nostalrius and other vanilla servers for YEARS. Vanilla isn't going to die you're crazy.
[3:38:11] thatman0006: and there goes the servers
[3:38:16] thatman0006: dead for the rest of the day
[3:38:20] napur_a: in tbc I hit 1800 pvp rating with my bro. w/ double rogue lol! this time around my bro and I only want to raid
[3:38:21] NILLme: farming 5k will take days LUL back in tbc it took me weeks
[3:38:25] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee I don't think some people get the stagnation of the game kills it thats y progress is big. You can do as simple comparison to retail. Alot of retail players stop playing temporarily once content is cleared/on farm.
[3:38:26] AnimatedTopaz: some of these people drank way too much classic coolaid
[3:38:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Towelliee there is an addon called Attune that shows where are in each attunement works now and it has the TBC raids on it already
[3:38:32] Triist0ne: Kreygasm
[3:38:34] toobaked1987: @Towelliee would you rather they work and improve shadowlands systems or just move on to something else and end with at least a great story?

[3:53:53] Frosty1u1: retail is good tbc is good we aint gotta hate on one cause we like tthe other
[3:53:53] TheGaoSora: He keeps showing different games... what a cringe
[3:53:53] jackjonesiii: i was getting drunk in college during legion sadly lol
[3:53:54] D3m0nHunt3r666: And WoD Kappa
[3:53:54] Allvarez: i wish SL had 2 more dungeons
[3:53:55] Capy_IRL: getting BFA flying was horrible
[3:53:56] gears_vet: @Towelliee dude you will quit a couple weeks into tbc and run back to retail
[3:53:57] SyrothTV: mission tables are garbo
[3:53:58] VBTIGER89: lets be honestrr
[3:54:01] broopyd: its almost like you now get paid to play the game
[3:54:03] FatChase: But what about the social aspects @Towelliee WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS
[3:54:04] Ardune: legion had by far the most content out of all expansions 36 artifact weapons with unique questlines and 12 different class campaigns
[3:54:04] A_Cold_0ne: whats cata
[3:54:05] VodkaReloaded: I've had more interactions and friendships with ppl on classic than legion,bfa, and shadowlands combined. just not the same game anymore
[3:54:07] ShadoodHD: i mean damn i watched some good BC raid kill videos with epic music and eurobeat songs LUL
[3:54:08] Genilort: wotlk pvp prime time
[3:54:09] metavahn231: wrath 2nd

[3:54:19] Bombayshow: VodkaReloaded your right
[3:54:33] Srdjan91: True
[3:54:34] Nutqase: bc then wotlk and last bfa
[3:54:40] NILLme: anima tho LUL
[3:54:41] Znza: he shouldve just touched on the abysmal systems they constantly add
[3:54:41] gears_vet: leveled professions, farmed gold, wpvp
[3:54:41] A_Cold_0ne: then your free to pvp and farm
[3:54:44] 2MakeMe: yep, and if u were on point, you were stronger than the other person
[3:54:48] TheGaoSora: @VodkaReloaded because you're forced to, you can't do anything solo
[3:54:49] kokochris: Solo content is fine and should exist.  Hell I only PUG now and I'm still enjoying WoW like I did back in 2004.
[3:54:49] A_Cold_0ne: dont have to do daily crap for hours
[3:54:50] 2eudaimonia3: !TBC

[3:54:55] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[3:54:57] Phalamore: He's comparing SL to TBC....not Legion to TBC
[3:54:58] Tharia: burn
[3:54:59] Screamnsteam: "player power" collecting anima for transmogs lmao
[3:55:00] Hohnathan: I think he means retail Now
[3:55:01] Tharia: lol
[3:55:02] SyrothTV: iqd was the last good daily hub
[3:55:03] gears_vet: whats eso
[3:55:03] TweakT: he said the thing D:
[3:55:03] 2MakeMe: uhh skyrim is single player
[3:55:10] thepurpleproject: He just said Final Fantasy 12 sucks D:
[3:55:11] fooxytv: he obviously hates retail, why do they need to make content saying how bad it is to him?
[3:55:12] SonofHorus82: oh boy Quel'Danar dailies let's do this! People that pretend there weren't dailies in TBC are fucking dumb.
[3:55:16] TheGaoSora: Kinda is.. though it makes some things better
[3:55:16] saitama8: ALOT OF FON
[3:55:16] Syllvn: Nope
[3:55:21] Hohnathan: he said play skyrim aka 1 player
[3:55:22] mavericks312: how do you compare Slands to tbc but only use legion content
[3:55:23] othraerir: morowind > skyrim anyway
[3:55:27] justateapot: What
[3:55:28] TheGaoSora: WHAT
[3:55:29] themaliciousrabbit: True
[3:55:30] Frosty1u1: and casting fireball over and over is better
[3:55:33] gstrydr67: luxthos is in on classic
[3:55:35] CDubTheRIPper: danHmm
[3:55:35] Capy_IRL: One of the best thing about WOW is how the characters move. no other MMOs feel as good
[3:55:39] themaliciousrabbit: Actually true...
[3:55:44] Trasheye: pantie bonus D:
[3:55:44] broopyd: 100% true
[3:55:46] Znza: false lmao, our guild said fuck rogues till t6 and pretty much all melee LUL
[3:55:46] A_Cold_0ne: they fcked whirlwind for shamans so long ago, broke
[3:55:51] Peketr4ck: why is he so obsessed with the "social" omg
[3:55:55] A_Cold_0ne: windfury*
[3:55:55] Trasheye: Boffs YEP
[3:55:55] metavahn231: alot of good synergy in tbc
[3:55:56] Vexxsis: nothing beats og talent trees
[3:56:00] Osskssa: no
[3:56:05] dirtylurker69: top people complain about Battle Shout, monk debuff and DH magic debuff already LUL
[3:56:05] Dimitrios90: I dont like to be social :)
[3:56:05] thepurpleproject: @Im_Capy Good point. Moving and casting abilities in WoW feels miles better than most other MMOs
[3:56:08] maalow: the only argument here is ' it's more social'
[3:56:09] metavahn231: not just "bringdk/monk hur hur" retail
[3:56:09] Holysal: @Peketr4ck bc thats what he wants out of the game
[3:56:10] Streamcrush: It was a pita to get group invites in tbc if you didn't have cc
[3:56:13] tripl3heart: This is CLASSIC ANDY gone too far lulw
[3:56:19] TheGaoSora: @Peketr4ck traffic
[3:56:23] Ardune: just another classic andy who hates everything retail and can't choose both FailFish
[3:56:25] Jokervenom1978: hE is A TOOL.
[3:56:25] Sorgenkind87: in bc they are support speccs and thats good , i miss this
[3:56:27] ZakuzaGB: i mean i kinda disagree a bit i feel like classes have some raid/party stuff just not as much in order to balance all the classes more
[3:56:29] broopyd: @tripl3heart this part is literally correct though
[3:56:30] 2MakeMe: its all bout PARS
[3:56:34] SonofHorus82: "Why TBC is better than Shadowlands," shows not Shadowlands content in the video.
[3:56:36] 2MakeMe: orange or nada
[3:56:38] Tooshkit: @maalow yes and that is the main point why people like classic
[3:56:39] jackjonesiii: bc will be parses
[3:56:40] TheGaoSora: fuck parses and fuck rio
[3:56:41] Moxgoat: classic is all about parsing too
[3:56:50] Brezitrex: Fury
[3:56:50] Chasery: lets be honest, most people did that in classic... Look at world buffs
[3:56:51] Southy135: isnt that the same for classic raids? people like parcing in any raid in any game
[3:56:52] Vexxsis: yup
[3:56:52] all_beef_franks: People in classic are just as crazy about Parsing, I promise
[3:56:54] MrTrebs: yeah thats why tbc raids was 8 warriors and 6 resto shaman
[3:56:57] mavericks312: can we rename the video why tbc is better then legion at this point
[3:56:58] ackrite4891: servers back
[3:56:58] Capy_IRL: even SV hunter does LUL
[3:56:59] Wedgeh: @TheOmniSora Amen!
[3:56:59] Brodie818: remember bring the player not the class ?
[3:57:00] MrTrebs: LUL
[3:57:04] Southy135: Fuck, they parse in Swtor
[3:57:08] 2MakeMe: but classic is like omgea pars, need world buffs and everything
[3:57:08] Ammaro_x: apart from rogues i believe
[3:57:14] Mitune: having full blown support classes was nice.
[3:57:14] Logabrick: I mean retail has some of that, just not as detailed it was back then
[3:57:16] Madnezz123: parses are irelevant, they require cheesy strats
[3:57:16] snaksy: Or u dont have anything if u are rogue LUL

[3:57:17] fooxytv: @Moxgoat it definitely is now and tbc will be the same
[3:57:32] Layercake: Thats classic design...
[3:57:32] Genilort: classic is too slow combat pvp wise
[3:57:33] gstrydr67: luxthos is in on classic
[3:57:33] themaliciousrabbit: Ok maybe not ret KEKW
[3:57:34] FerociouzMonk: legion was the best modern wow
[3:57:35] Madnezz123: like 3 power infusions
[3:57:36] CDubTheRIPper: LuL
[3:57:36] Trasheye: Arcane KEKW
[3:57:39] TheGaoSora: LUL
[3:57:40] Bksuppan: surv hunter buff tbc Kreygasm
[3:57:41] TheDeathbinder: I liked how you could solo worls bosses in BFA
[3:57:41] Bazsidiver: healig is way better in retail
[3:57:42] ZakuzaGB: @Towelliee i think the reason they went this direction is to balance all dps/tanks and healers and let everyone play the class they want
[3:57:43] Frosty1u1: the class philosophy is tbc was good but retail combat is better
[3:57:48] Bombayshow: that leeroy mog LUL
[3:57:50] Kromede: rip demo my dream
[3:57:53] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee  the devs talk about class buff homogenization like it's a terrible thing, but it would make a lot more classes be viable for raid
[3:58:00] GeoKyros: ENhancement shaman became viable dps spec with dual wield in TBC as well. It made hybrid classes viable and that's why we loved it back then
[3:58:01] 2MakeMe: everyone has a fukin stun
[3:58:02] TheGaoSora: 69 dmg nice
[3:58:07] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:58:07] 2MakeMe: and a fukin heal
[3:58:15] jackjonesiii: mm no stun
[3:58:19] GrizzlyGriggs: a bunch of classes have BL? uhh mages and shams and that's it right?
[3:58:20] ZakuzaGB: disagree
[3:58:21] Chasery: The thing is, the game has changed and the general feeling is performance matters. It's been reinforced over decades of play
[3:58:23] nuudelz: cookie cutter
[3:58:24] rocthenite: cringe
[3:58:25] Trasheye: I like the old talent tree over the new one
[3:58:25] DocsMistake: HEY HEY lookin good bossman @Towelliee , good to see the camera back bro
[3:58:26] hadesxfrost: I heard survival hunters were bis lollll
[3:58:27] GrizzlyGriggs: in retail
[3:58:28] t0pgun_: not really
[3:58:28] DoubleNova: here we go LUL
[3:58:29] FerociouzMonk: talent system ResidentSleeper
[3:58:29] ZakuzaGB: old talent system had more dead talents then retail
[3:58:29] Bakuryuha96: Nah fuck the old talent system
[3:58:30] FatChase: Everyone would have the same talents though
[3:58:32] tripl3heart: uncle Bob
[3:58:36] LucidAntics: @GrizzlyGriggs hunters
[3:58:36] just_laxus: bullshit everyone is just gonna take the best build EVERY TIME
[3:58:37] gears_vet: you are such a hater bro, typical retail andy
[3:58:37] mwchaos: hard disagree
[3:58:38] Jay_Vee_NL: old talent system is BiS
[3:58:40] Phoxzy: Disagree, too many people ran the same damn cookie cutter that Thotbot has for your class.
[3:58:41] Streamcrush: I miss the talent tree system
[3:58:41] metavahn231: naw towellie hes right
[3:58:41] hadesxfrost: Survival hunter for the win in tbc !
[3:58:41] headshotb1lly: retail has better talents, classic is cookie cutter & never touch it
[3:58:43] dracullatv: yeah and after 3 weeks im out of gold
[3:58:43] AcidSyndicate: ski√º this shit
[3:58:43] Mitune: this one really depends on the class more than anything
[3:58:44] dracullatv: :KEK
[3:58:44] Khakiduck: end cookie cutting anyway KEKW
[3:58:46] mavericks312: how much better was the talent system honestly, everyone who raided talented the same just like now
[3:58:46] MrTrebs: there are still builds for differen things, weird argument
[3:58:47] metavahn231: its not all about raiding
[3:58:47] Chasery: KEKW
[3:58:48] GrizzlyGriggs: @LucidAntics oh true true
[3:58:48] TheGaoSora: You Could... but no one cares about your build if you want to join an instance
[3:58:49] SonofHorus82: What if Bob isnt my uncle?
[3:58:49] Gorestack: thats a kappa
[3:58:51] toobaked1987: Luxthos is on classic so he doesnt roast anyone in mythic +. :D
[3:58:54] CDubTheRIPper: WutFace
[3:58:54] FerociouzMonk: old talent tree but with better refined talents would be better...
[3:58:55] Jay_Vee_NL: monkaW
[3:58:55] themaliciousrabbit: I mean true... But theres still BiS talents... You dont stray from them too much.
[3:58:56] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[3:58:57] t0pgun_: LUL
[3:58:58] 2MakeMe: tbh i do really miss old talent trees though;.
[3:59:00] Bakuryuha96: "Different" builds Lmao
[3:59:00] AcidSyndicate: skip this shit
[3:59:00] CDubTheRIPper: SMOrc
[3:59:00] Keleerge: LUL
[3:59:01] HamersonGaming: lol
[3:59:03] vocalpenguin: LULW
[3:59:05] LucidAntics: @GrizzlyGriggs but still, 3 classes isnt "a bunch"
[3:59:05] TheSpace_Sloth: hes not totally wrong there are build for gold farm builds for raid and builds for pvp but is the extent of it tbh
[3:59:05] Osskssa: hes right
[3:59:06] DoubleNova: it's the same thing just masked by choice
[3:59:07] Jay_Vee_NL: monkaS
[3:59:08] hardstyletaco96: @gears_vet just because dosent blindly praise classic
[3:59:08] imjorman: "insulting" lmao
[3:59:13] metavahn231: it was cool making weird pvp builds
[3:59:13] Ardune: why is it always EU classic andys that are the most cringe
[3:59:13] Trasheye: xD
[3:59:14] lonelybloody2: personaly i prefer tallent system but its my opinion
[3:59:15] NickLeonhearth: yep in BC ppl will not google the best spec and stay with it until the rest of their life LOL
[3:59:16] Capy_IRL: i think i have changed one single talent in retail since the start of bfa :/
[3:59:16] bergzj: !tbc

[3:59:17] justateapot: he didn't even talk about drums that didn't give you sated in tbc
[3:59:18] ArcaneSyntax: I like the old talents for leveling, but the new ones are way better for raiding and endgame content
[3:59:20] NILLme: retail talents are the same, i never changed my build, its even good for M+ LUL
[3:59:20] Chupatwo: me smash bad guy SMOrc

[3:59:22] GrizzlyGriggs: @LucidAntics yea agreed

[3:59:23] Leafylockx: advanced? lmao
[3:59:26] ZakuzaGB: i like s ome of these guys points but it sounds to me that hes suck the TB D
[3:59:27] Ardune: I swear all EU people are classic andys
[3:59:30] gears_vet: @filipmundo96 why isnt he still playing shadowlands?
[3:59:31] duhworks: i mean we are
[3:59:33] Anddroiden_: Blizz already have plenty of problems balancing everything else, why add in another big system for them to balance
[3:59:36] Hellifyoudont66: They changed it on Cata.
[3:59:38] metavahn231: no difference in retail, everyone takes the same build, just less choices
[3:59:38] cabalish: they made wow simpler in that manner u have to agree
[3:59:39] jambii03: hey nice to see you again
[3:59:42] GeoKyros: Tbh as someone who played since early release I can't bring myself to play classic and tbc. It ain't the same now
[3:59:42] ShadoodHD: look man we already know the meta for tbc talent tree so KEKW
[3:59:43] Chasery: I think homogenization has been a large problem
[3:59:44] CrusaderNero: check out wowhead! NEW STORE MOUNT INC!! Maybe for BC
[3:59:49] DoubleNova: not really
[3:59:49] FluskB: 8/10
[3:59:51] mavericks312: talents werent complicated sorry everyone spec'd the way top tier guilds did
[3:59:51] P3rk3l3s: P3rk3l3s subscribed with Prime. 
[3:59:55] TheGaoSora: EXACTLY
[3:59:55] SonofHorus82: LOL NO RPG ELEMENT IN FALLOUT 4 LIKE WHAAAAAAAAAAT????
[3:59:57] A_New_Challenger: is retail back up too?
[3:59:59] Bakuryuha96: like 2 of them
[4:00:02] MisterElectric: Classic Andy's gave that video a 10/10   everyone else a 4/10
[4:00:03] JPS15: did you really? lol you would just pick what was best
[4:00:04] A_New_Challenger: nvm :)
[4:00:06] Natureswisp: True Sadge
[4:00:08] AcidAbyss: thigs also have to change or it gets stale af
[4:00:09] zodd_amhai: true but more choice is always better
[4:00:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: The only servers that matter are up Kappa
[4:00:12] ginsanop: @Towelliee i think ppl miss the illusion of choice
[4:00:18] metavahn231: puting head in sand and actling like there's nothing else to do but raid LUL

[4:00:26] Dimitrios90: I am Classic and Retail Andy :)
[4:00:27] Althalos94: We should have both. Old talent and new talents. Old talent to decide your spec, new to change from situation to situation
[4:00:27] kngkoopa: thats the thing about game design, if you have all these choices, but one choice is superior, you are giving players one choice essentially
[4:00:28] Capy_IRL: dual spec changed it big time Vs classic
[4:00:28] TheGaoSora: ESO needs to get rid of it's fake talent tree as well, would be more enjoyable..
[4:00:28] TheSpace_Sloth: 3 specs 1 for gold, 1 for raid, and 1 for pvp depending on class but thats it
[4:00:32] Osskssa: it was relevant because you made them relevant with different builds for different things you are doing
[4:00:33] TweakT: mic check
[4:00:35] Mitune: I wish they would kinda hit a middle ground between the old talents and retail style
[4:00:36] TweakT: 123
[4:00:41] ShadoodHD: and we were in the best of our time...
[4:00:42] Zenfar_: by cataclysm the talent trees where just fill all the bars
[4:00:43] Splitzor: one thing that i dont get is why people hate idea that classic gets updated graphics,  who wants to play with outdated and poor graphics??
[4:00:43] MrTrebs: some of them were useless in the sense that you NEEDED them just to get to a certain talent, it was a waste of5 points
[4:00:49] ShadoodHD: now... pepeLaugh
[4:00:52] Znza: @Towelliee people that farm have to use different talents, a mage farming and boosting isnt the same talented mage thats running naxx
[4:00:55] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee and today's talents are a lot more flexible.
[4:00:57] BlueBeast33: There is something really nice about getting a new talent point every level though
[4:00:58] mavericks312: talents are the same they just cut out the useless filler talents
[4:00:58] Fhatal: Druid may be the exception. so many choices
[4:01:00] themaliciousrabbit: Resto druid in TBC had a lot of choices which I like. There's legit 3 different healing builds just for PvE and they're all good. then you have pvp spec, etc.
[4:01:02] Alienfromger: meaningful choices? LUL
[4:01:02] soysos91: It was a lot fake "choices" really, everyone was the same build
[4:01:02] FerociouzMonk: the talent tree could be done better..
[4:01:03] Chasery: With all of the data we have now, the vast majority of people will go best spec
[4:01:03] broopyd: @Towelliee sorry bro you're wrong on that last part
[4:01:05] gears_vet: @Towelliee i guarantee you dont last a month on tbc before you run back to retail
[4:01:05] Capy_IRL: its a gold sink, as little as it is, its a one less gold sink in the game now
[4:01:05] CDubTheRIPper: hot cakes? crreamChonk
[4:01:07] Eddz20: I somewhat agree, people will always google whats BiS and just pick that
[4:01:08] metavahn231: there's a reason people want classic lol

[4:01:32] TheGaoSora: The guy pays for boosts, doesn't pay for his games, this all you need to know about him...
[4:01:33] SyrothTV: @Towelliee "useless" talents were only "bad" for the meta playstyle.  They were useful for solo gold farming or heroic spam; or open world mat farming
[4:01:35] CardinalTX: People just get bent when the choice is removed even if they would follow the meta anyway........funny
[4:01:39] Ardune: don't need a mic because I never talk to anyone :)

[4:02:52] broopyd: @Towelliee sorry you're just wrong, classic talents can vary between your gear, what boss you're doing or even your role. Some rogues need imp EA spec for example, some warriors need demo shout talent. Druids spec changes entirely dependant on gear etc

[4:13:08] Wildside1177: Disagree.WotLK was awesome. O loved it like you love TBC. But hey, we can agree to disagree.
[4:13:08] Ximbu_: wod classic = wod release Kappa

[4:14:21] danimoto10: like covid is understandable, but I dont know that is too much
[4:14:22] fistofnature: i might unsub once i get Ksm, just farming anima for x amount of months just seems boring
[4:14:23] Bombayshow: shadowland is good , people  just cant play mmo anymore
[4:14:26] fiingerz: i think the community nees to relax this expansion has happened during a pandemic
[4:14:26] Moobot: Don't forget that every month you get a free Twitch Sub with Amazon Prime! towSellout Step 1 - twitch.amazon.com/prime Step 2 - Hit Subscribe on my channel page and HIT THIS BUTTON BABY i.imgur.com/XCoETwY.png towPog
[4:14:29] Layercake: the 60 bucks from 58 tbc boost will help
[4:14:31] mavericks312: @othraerir not really the whole gaming industry is behind so try again
[4:14:31] VBTIGER89: well covid like it or not its a cunt
[4:14:34] ReplayAttacks: I stopped playing SL after the first month :(
[4:14:35] Natureswisp: Shiiit at least Bobi got his cut POG
[4:14:35] Ardune: covid is 100000% a good excuse lmao
[4:14:35] at1c: @wadethewaters Building games is not easy let alone from home.
[4:14:37] AirmVn: if you work in anything development you will know it's true
[4:14:39] D3CMON: hey Towelie did the Browns get a good pick up Anthony Walker from the Colts?
[4:14:45] Zip13: I need to finish ksm and 1800
[4:14:45] stijn0416: SL has to many chores
[4:14:46] othraerir: i won't change my opinion mavo
[4:14:46] Shugaze: we might get more wow subs with tbc since its so Retail Like and Vanila at the same time
[4:14:49] mrpresbaby: Any wagers today? I need more anima
[4:14:50] Frosty1u1: ya they cant let the draught kill the momentum that shadowlands has
[4:14:51] S1appadabass: is shadowlands continues to suck ass, at least we have TBC and Diablo coming
[4:14:54] headshotb1lly: my work has been so much more productive since WFH - for me its a bit of a cop out bliz saying that
[4:14:54] brewzerXO: COVID is a real excuse, the entire gaming industry has been hit, as has everyone elses industry, saying it is a cop out is a shit take
[4:14:54] nintendyoh: @Towelliee What's your take on Shadowlands currently in retrospect to other expansions.
[4:15:04] Bombayshow: That if China dont fuck up again . they fucked up alot past 20 yrs
[4:15:04] captn_insano91: I mean gearing is easy I'm pushing me on apts for something to do
[4:15:04] wadethewaters: @At1c with enough money, anything is possible. Please dont be a blizzard shill, they didnt want to spend money and thats the issue
[4:15:10] Syllvn: @Towelliee As someone who works at a games studio during Covid, absolutely valid reasoning. It's sucked and we don't have a giant MMO to make
[4:15:13] Ardune: people don't realize how much covid has effected every single industry or they have there heads in there sand
[4:15:13] just_laxus: i feel like games like wow are much harder to make from home then games like hearthstone
[4:15:16] robertjordan83: @Towelliee everyone at blizz who thinks they'll be able to work from home after the pandemic is in for a ruuuuuuuuuuude awakening
[4:15:16] Alienfromger: but vacc dont change anything bcause they dont know if it works
[4:15:17] majinmeww: I don‚Äôt understand how having fun is overrated. Everyone who says it‚Äôs overrated also say they had fun and it was memorable. Like what was overrated about Wrath?
[4:15:20] Red_Dead_Redeem: SL feels more like a chore than actually gameplay and enjoying the expansion
[4:15:22] pvtpilot88: @D3CMON Anthony Walker is a beast... sad to lose him and the duo he made with D Leonard
[4:15:27] Speshulist: people honestly take advantage of working at home.  I see so many of my coworkers saying they are online working, but never producing
[4:15:30] aeon0987: Yostin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Happy Reset Day!
[4:15:31] Artonis1: going to see store mounts in tbc classic with phase stalker the start?
[4:15:31] tedol: at this rate, Blizzard should be back in office by October or November, so 9.2 in January?
[4:15:44] at1c: @wadethewaters Money don't solve TIME, no amount of money can solve this.
[4:15:51] laughing_octopus: dude imagine working in blizzard dude i would slack as much as i can till i get fired and join any studio hiring ex blizzard employees
[4:15:52] Llamatude: what about ghost crawlers new MMO you think that will come to light?
[4:15:53] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee TBH SLANDS doesn't have as big of issues as BFA did. I think with season resets as well as VALOR RESETS, at the same time plus fixing the maw issue will make it good tbh
[4:15:58] kokochris: ya they maybe cutting
[4:16:01] A_New_Challenger: Introduce a deeper transmog system tied into running Torghast over and over and a lot of time could be bought...They missed an opportunity there IMO
[4:16:01] Zip13: Pog just like WoD
[4:16:01] ProLandman: well they laying off more people so could happen
[4:16:02] stijn0416: straight into 10.1
[4:16:03] fistofnature: no last patch PepeHands
[4:16:04] Alienfromger: another wod expansion?
[4:16:04] szble: oh boy end of wod
[4:16:06] brewzerXO: @Towelliee WoD 2.0?
[4:16:07] Natureswisp: Sadge
[4:16:07] flebbooo: probably gonna be that way PepeHands
[4:16:08] Cartharon: which will be sad if it may screw the story
[4:16:09] headshotb1lly: some of that 200m bonus might of been on some extra resource LUL
[4:16:13] Bombayshow: they removed abysall may from cataclysm im not scared
[4:16:14] magemaster225: 9.2 gonna be last patch
[4:16:15] Alegnowar: they cutted 9.3 already
[4:16:19] TheUnknowing: I mean I feel like they should just make the expansion longer with this current pacing
[4:16:23] mavericks312: i think covid changes xpac cycle possibly as well
[4:16:23] vocalpenguin: i think shadowlands will be an extra long expansion
[4:16:25] wadethewaters: @At1c When you lay off your workers, yes its going to take more time. Maybe hire some people and pay them instead of giving the CEO 200 million.
[4:16:26] tedol: 2 years until the next expansion announcement, right?
[4:16:27] idenkaz_: well if they can take the hit i can see that.
[4:16:31] brewzerXO: Sadge Shattrath raid
[4:16:33] D3m0nHunt3r666: Cut anima Kappa
[4:16:37] theoriginalzinng: @ClassicShaneTV unpopular opinion but wod was actually decent though
[4:16:40] Kayonne: What is that addon at the top showing time to level btw?
[4:16:41] Layercake: Just kill Sylvanas and lets go to 10.0
[4:16:42] VBTIGER89: amoungus came ot in 2018 so I dont think its in the convo
[4:16:42] DewWut: classic being profitable may allow them to stretch out retail releases
[4:16:45] Layercake: Kappa
[4:16:48] at1c: @Towelliee but next expansions pack is 100% also behind.
[4:16:49] Wulfgrym: wouldn't that also depend on how well the next expansion is going for them.
[4:16:49] Streamcrush: To be honest, Shadowlands is the perfect expansion for a longer expansion cycle. You can literally invent new places to go and it will fit right into the lore.
[4:16:55] Ardune: I've always had a feeling this expansion would be like a WoD 2.0
[4:16:56] BlueBeast33: If there's no 9.3 then we're looking at a Siege of Orgrimmar sized content drought
[4:16:57] brewzerXO: @theoriginalzinng but they cut content was my point
[4:16:58] Triist0ne: man you're getting me depressed
[4:17:01] othraerir: guess they'll have to change the story ;)
[4:17:02] Vargg1983: good, make SL as short as we can
[4:17:08] wadethewaters: imagine them releasing as much content as TBC had when it first launched
[4:17:12] Mathhbm: 2 boss raid prob will happen
[4:17:14] wadethewaters: Old blizzard <3
[4:17:15] tedol: they can make 9.3 for Summer 2022
[4:17:20] fistofnature: looks like undercity?
[4:17:22] TheDeathbinder: What about a mega Dungeon?
[4:17:22] bjornssonfury: @Towelliee what server you on?
[4:17:22] Frosty1u1: @Vargg1983 why shadowlands isnt bad
[4:17:28] pDLjay: Other Devs especially the smaller ones are doing fine in covid. its probably really bad for these big dev teams
[4:17:30] kokochris: towHAMUP
[4:17:31] JareBear813: Activisions issue (not blizzard) is they dont put nearly as much money and resources back into the game as they receive from the player base. they literally make $50mil a month from subs alone
[4:17:37] at1c: @wadethewaters While I don't agree with him taking 200 mil bonus. Everyone is affected by covid and making games from home is a lot harder no matter if he did take a bonus or not.
[4:17:37] TheHolyLite: Slands was waaaaaay overhyped gotta give it to blizz getting a lot of content creators involved with alpha and beta so they could kind of control the narrative or essentially keep content creators from raiding it apart I agree we only getting 3 raids 8 month patches they didn‚Äôt double the wow team when they released classic Na mean
[4:17:37] Winchh: !tbc

[4:17:39] wadethewaters: Activision-Blizzard is garbage, they cant make expansions. Old Blizzard is where its at
[4:17:41] Trexxter: As I'm a customer, I'm currently postponed my subscription to WoW until I get something new
[4:17:46] theoriginalzinng: retail still not up... they must be still nerfing VDH and "fixing" monk bugs lol
[4:17:46] Gravity16: Zeppelin
[4:17:49] racketpunch: Regardless of patch delays, this expansion is one of the worst and it‚Äôs not Covids fault
[4:17:55] Bombayshow: Cant be worse than siege of orgrimar LUL
[4:17:56] ttvcapin: ttvcapin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! hammers up towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:17:59] Ardune: Blizzard barely even exists anymore it's basically just Activision at this point
[4:18:03] mrpresbaby: time change lol

[4:18:15] plsloveme74: @chat is the servers up?
[4:18:16] Mitune: Monk bugs got fixed and they buffed them
[4:18:17] Kromede: i will not use my 10 wow tokens for gametime
[4:18:19] tedol: @Ardune  it's like that since late Cata
[4:18:20] idenkaz_: that monk buff is nice tbh. glad they listened
[4:18:28] ExtreemeCheese: realm list is up at least
[4:18:32] wadethewaters: @At1c if Elon musk has people building rockets and sending them to space, Blizzard can release 9.1 bro. Theres no excuse, your shilling isn't going to help.
[4:18:33] casualboomer: LUL blizzard has no clue what they're doing LUL
[4:18:38] Bombayshow: D:
[4:18:39] Fallensymbol: wod is still bad nothing can top it, BFA was meh and SL is a bit above Meh
[4:18:39] Lootze: Lootze subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[4:18:40] themaliciousrabbit: Do you ever think the company will get so bad that they will just stop producing WoW content? Or do you think they'll just milk WoW for the next 10+ years regardless of the quality?
[4:18:46] jeneraljelly: thats such a joke..
[4:18:47] Bombayshow: are you fucking kidding me ? really ?
[4:18:50] casualboomer: clown. shoes.
[4:18:50] tedol: @casualboomer  isn't that main point of blizzard games/
[4:18:50] Bombayshow: ffffffffffffff
[4:18:51] Speshulist: I <3 my Blood DK, but feel bad that they still don't feel good.  Spikey dmg with physical that I can heal up, doesn't feel good.
[4:18:51] othraerir: cuz blizz can't do math
[4:18:52] casualboomer: straight clownshoes
[4:18:53] Ardune: @tedol I wouldn't go that far I'd say WoD but yeah
[4:18:54] magemaster225: fix paladin armor bugs
[4:18:56] CDubTheRIPper: LUL

[4:19:03] idenkaz_: someone test survival may discover some broken shit KEKW
[4:19:03] smashwow: blizz and math never equates Kappa
[4:19:05] RetroMetros: What was the mopnk bug?
[4:19:05] TheHolyLite: I didn‚Äôt hate wod raids were good would of been fine if they released shatt imo
[4:19:08] Ardune: @tedol you're still right
[4:19:14] Alegnowar: all of em monkaS
[4:19:18] Dimitrios90: @smashwow true LUL
[4:19:18] pvtpilot88: 15%
[4:19:21] mox2g: 40
[4:19:31] tedol: @Ardune  cata was rework from nowhere, so, maybe since there
[4:19:34] Klauzzer: lol
[4:19:35] jeneraljelly: what a meme blizz is now :(
[4:19:41] Zip13: It‚Äôs been like since Feb 2 we‚Äôve had that bugged trait @towelliee
[4:19:41] casualboomer: So their MR was 40% instead of 25%?
[4:19:42] Speshulist: that's a CD that's permanent
[4:19:43] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee i may be mistaken, didn't you mention this something about this during beta, that this stuff might happen?
[4:19:45] wadethewaters: I think Blizzard knows Shadowlands is shit, and they are just going to put everything into Classic TBC/WOTLK since its a lot less work and they will make way more money
[4:19:47] theoriginalzinng: yeah its like 2 key levels worth of magic damage
[4:19:49] MOLAR305: looks like they needed a qa team, oh wait
[4:19:57] at1c: @wadethewaters LOL on that compering. Its like compering as someone making food to making video games. Not even remotely the same. You know what I recommend that you join the video games industry and come back to me.
[4:20:03] Llamatude: because they are all WFH
[4:20:06] pvtpilot88: all of the ranks of demonic wards passive were stacking basically according to the wowhead post
[4:20:06] SpreedyTV: hey Towelliee good to see you :D
[4:20:08] CDubTheRIPper: realm list is up
[4:20:10] Ardune: @tedol they still had chris metzen during cata though so it was still blizzard more or less imo
[4:20:24] ShadoodHD: and i thought PTR can help squish bugs NotLikeThis
[4:20:27] magemaster225: WoW:Inifnity War
[4:20:29] pDLjay: I dont think Shadowlands is shit, imagine 9.1 would be out now or soon
[4:20:31] D3m0nHunt3r666: legion 2.0 Kappa
[4:20:34] othraerir: won't the story be scuffed if they scrap 9.3?
[4:20:35] TheUnknowing: 10.0 will have to be another legion to save the game again LOL
[4:20:36] doogs44: I think  they are just soooo far behind bc of work from home and other shitty ea/activision decisions.
[4:20:37] robertjordan83: @Towelliee they could make SL two expacs
[4:20:37] wadethewaters: @At1c So only blizzard employees work from home, not anyone else? also its "comparing".
[4:20:43] shmasherd: SL was crazy ambitious and they got piledrived by covid in the process.
[4:20:45] mavericks312: if they cut a tier we could be in store for a legion quality epac next
[4:20:48] mavericks312: xpac*
[4:20:49] SpreedyTV: on cam :D
[4:20:51] TheHolyLite: Shadowlands is the result of a hard pivot in the story after the war of thorns imo
[4:20:52] Mathhbm: VOIDLORD XPAC PogChamp
[4:20:53] tedol: 10.0 should be in pre-alpha stage already
[4:20:53] racketpunch: Shadowlands was supposed to be that crazy shit already. But it‚Äôs just shit
[4:20:55] themaliciousrabbit: @pDLjay Yeahhhh 9.1 isnt anywhere close to being out.
[4:21:02] SilkeySmooth: shadow lands is truly wod 2.0and I'm ok with that because of classic tbc
[4:21:04] kokochris: sounds like ur gonna do standup

[4:21:05] dimofodi: I'd like to see them still hit all the "tiers" but maybe less bosses in raids making them a bit faster to clear to catch up but not miss out on things/
[4:21:07] Ardune: @tedol but it was the end of blizz and metzen so you're still right pretty much
[4:21:08] Bombayshow: they probably work on sl Since legion so
[4:21:08] CDubTheRIPper: they have to be cooking up something for shadowlands to make up for all the time
[4:21:13] MOLAR305: like you are on stage?

[4:21:29] Putcride: They should atleast put a filler content if they take that route like ruby sanctum
[4:21:29] Janribet: I wonder what the next expansion will be
[4:21:31] othraerir: andrew dice clay!
[4:21:31] pDLjay: @HGYordle ye it really bumbed me out when I heard that news... and alot of people lost interest in SL

[5:25:56] SonofHorus82: how has he gotten this far without training the taunt on the voidwalker???
[5:26:10] rocthenite: he is already talking like it is a store mount
[5:26:12] McEmmsi: nice glasses
[5:26:13] DocsMistake: voidwalker sucks at tanking is probably why
[5:26:13] Steadmoh190: wait that mount will be in the tbc classic launch?
[5:26:16] Farfic: no previous phase-hunter mounts though.. new I guess
[5:26:19] Bleusempai: i mean, it's the same with hunters right?
[5:26:21] Rayman_1990: void cant hold aggro anyway, even with taunt
[5:26:24] DocsMistake: it is a garbage pet in classic
[5:26:24] tbbex_: @rocthenite Asmon? yeah, not surprised

[5:51:14] knightnighto: Are the servers back on??
[5:51:17] Aidler: @garrujak TRUE swiftYep
[5:51:29] Colt_Engineer: honestly they do
[5:51:34] Bleusempai: except BFA
[5:51:36] Colt_Engineer: learn that is
[5:51:41] Zomgboy: latest was TBC

Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[5:51:49] tyrel_jones: @Garrujak probably one of the best things i've seen ever in this chat
[5:51:50] HarryBlopper: !tbc
[5:51:51] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[5:52:05] Bahamut145: 8.2 was awesome
[5:52:07] toobaked1987: IF you played all of BFA it was incredible
[5:52:13] Thoreya: 8.2 was fire
[5:52:14] Colt_Engineer: the only issue I had was too much to do in BFA
[5:52:16] kokochris: Legion also started rocky; but turned out to be my favourite xpack
[5:52:23] swordwindgaming: Twilight Devastation redeemed BfA. Kappa
[5:52:24] Bleusempai: i see. yeah i didn't keep up with it personally
[5:52:29] Thoreya: i quit for a bit during 8.1
[5:52:30] Thoreya: it was bad
[5:52:32] dalaraz: bfa had huge amount of randomness in it
[5:52:34] K0rzak0v: 100% agree
[5:52:41] MistaHat: 8.3 was highlight for me, i did like the content in 8.2 but guilds were falling apart on mythic prog and i took a break
[5:52:46] BRUTALIT0PS: I thought I didn't like BfA until Shadowlands came out
[5:52:48] toobaked1987: CLASSICBFA lets go boys!
[5:52:50] BRUTALIT0PS: I want BfA back now
[5:52:51] tyrel_jones: I stopped playing retail in mid-bfa... and its crazy to me to see how much shadowlands has disappointed so far... "so far" that is.
[5:52:53] kokochris: 100% agree
[5:52:55] D3m0nHunt3r666: right now yes, at least I got gear in BFA :P
[5:53:00] Frostfury: I rather SL over BFA since the AP / Azerite pieces grind it was a joke
[5:53:02] vocalpenguin: were islands grindy? i didnt play BFA
[5:53:04] moggy1988: What did you just say ? wtf lol
[5:53:04] K0rzak0v: kul tiras & zandalar > shadowlands areas
[5:53:04] itscityboy: you think we'll get a new class anytime soon?
[5:53:17] MistaHat: @itscityboy lol
[5:53:24] Utmost777: Rich put it well, "Shadowlands is the best game i don't want to play"
[5:53:27] TheOldJimbo: Damn, ive been enjoying shadowlands and the story so far
[5:53:29] geokouts: i think the flawless has low droprate
[5:53:34] dalaraz: @itscityboy we have enough balance issues already,id prefer cut specs than adding :p
[5:53:46] itscityboy: @dalaraz true KEKW
[5:53:56] Tonto212: its all comes down to you enjoy grinding for rewards and shadowlands doesn't give you that, some people agree some dont
[5:54:02] Aidler: like the other guy said before. let us just kill sylvanas and we happily play SL without update for another 10 month.
[5:54:06] Abide13: don't do the flawless one. it's the lowest drop rate and basically only drops off the dragon that pats around blasted lands
[5:54:10] tyrel_jones: i will say the narratives are the only things I pay attention to still, now that I do not play
[5:54:15] itscityboy: at this point will players ever be satisfied with any expansion blizz puts out? KEKW
[5:54:15] tbbex_: I feel like M+ doesnt give enough
[5:54:27] Broheim2813: STILL no beta ???
[5:54:27] DunesGames: I love Shadowlands
[5:54:43] Utmost777: leveling my druid is so much easier and quicker than my pally was LUL
[5:55:05] toobaked1987: Blizzard keep paying your writiers well. When that goes to shit, oh lawd
[5:55:15] Broheim2813: So you might be playing it tonight ??
[5:55:17] MistaHat: he did the terminator one last night, wonder what that was about
[5:55:50] BRUTALIT0PS: SL story is fucking amazing!
[5:55:50] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:55:55] lieutenantdan416: Feelsbad i don't follow Lore Sadge. This probably a good time to start
[5:56:05] BRUTALIT0PS: Literally the only thing I enjoy about Shadowlands is the story
[5:56:07] swordwindgaming: The SL zone stories are interesting. The main story is the slowest jailbreak ever.
[5:56:21] maalow: I judge if an expac is good or bad at the end, every .0 patch kinda sucked tbh
[5:56:24] Utmost777: reclear fun
[5:56:29] swordwindgaming: The misadventures of the teapot gang > main story.
[5:56:30] Aidler: story could be even greater with sylvanas on the ground swiftyHappy
[5:56:30] Broheim2813: Damn, can't wait

[5:56:35] Garrujak: my complaint with the story goes solely to one part: Sylvanas. Haven't wanted to see her since Legion, it's time to put her to rest
[5:56:40] dalaraz: i jsut dont like how most of the story has nothing to do with gameplay.it comes from books and vids outside the game
[5:56:43] ventu105: Morning @Towelliee and chat
[5:57:13] Phoxzy: I bought mine, but I got it from Amazon for 179.99 earlier today.

[5:58:04] Colt_Engineer: like your talking in a pipe
[5:58:13] Bleusempai: kinda
[5:58:13] Aidler: jailor runes are not a save thing...
[5:58:14] dalaraz: eredar lord of the burning legion :p

[6:02:53] vocalpenguin: i have no interest in playing beta..i wanna watch it EZ
[6:02:54] Phoxzy: Is the mic arm attached to the desk, I tried that but it would pick any vibration into my desk, very aggravating.
[6:03:08] StShortyQ: time to cancel my plans for the day it sounds like :D
[6:03:10] SonofHorus82: dafuq? why am I getting an add?

[6:51:28] Rayman_1990: played a bit dungeons and dragons online MMO years ago. Pretty good game actually. Graphic looks a bit outdated nowdays tho

[6:53:41] MetalManGG: @Bombayshow I feel you buddy NotLikeThis
[6:53:43] Wulfgrym: i prefer dnd online becaues all my friends are too busy

[6:54:07] codedizle: ahh okay
[6:54:09] Wulfgrym: we have all our game stuff online
[6:54:17] Nehcrom: Sunk cost fallacy in action right there.
[6:54:19] PokerFaceMoose: roll20

[6:54:39] Layercake: 52 to 60 one scorpion at time HahaThink
[6:54:40] vocalpenguin: these are good grindy quests anyway
[6:54:45] Murlocz: @Towelliee Did u got ur Covid vaccine already? Even tho my country is the 5th at vaccination ranking i feel like im only get mine at august-september

[6:55:40] Saephon: @Towelliee That's how I got mine yesterday in vegas. Finally being fat worked in my favor Kappa
[6:55:41] Murlocz: From what ive seen its: US>China>UK>Israel and Brazil pretty much same
[6:55:43] hailstormz: the high risk group
[6:55:45] Genilort: sometimes the quests dont make sense. "Collect a scorpion sting" kills a scorpion with a sting, dosent get a sting for 10 mobs gets one the 11th
[6:55:56] theszoti: be careful, if you turn in one which has an objective for one of the other quests, it will only count for one quests
[6:55:57] Garrujak: Im in NJ and I still can't get one, and I'm a front line worker
[6:55:59] Alaquane: Mississippi just opened it to everyone last week, before that. it was old people or people at high risk (bmi, smokers, all the standard cancer like stuff)
[6:56:04] TheBrute07: They cannot see your medical history due to HIPAA laws, so just say you're obese.
[6:56:11] Hundicasm: I'm a healthyish person who works from home, I'm so far down my state's list
[6:56:16] SKARZYtwitch: yup
[6:56:24] Saephon: LOL exactly. just gotta wait until the 2nd, then we're going hard gym

[6:59:07] xXSiebzehnXx: slootK slootB
[6:59:11] youknowimboolin: Yes, u will turn in 1 quest and not be able to turn in others bcuz items will b gone
[6:59:24] Toxicityrose: Im slowly getting back into WoW
[6:59:38] KhaosDryad: I thought Un'goro and WPL/EPL was the good lvling spots for 50's

[7:00:01] Toxicityrose: Been since 10 yrs and Towelliee i used to be in your guild back in the day but been so long
[7:00:03] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @scryptx89 (warning)
[7:00:17] Layercake: HahaThink or buying it from the store in a few months
[7:00:20] anima189: I didn't post a link?
[7:00:22] Toxicityrose: Dont remember
[7:00:25] just_kirk_: Got epic flying in two days back then just farming herbs. Super easy to make gold
[7:00:39] Murlocz: @Towelliee Do u think the Warpstalker mount is really coming as a store mount for TBC?
[7:00:51] SopieMunky: Nope. Gotta go to Swamp of Sorrows.
[7:00:55] Wedgeh: Back in Stonard for vendors
[7:00:59] Toxicityrose: It might've been like community or something this was back in 2009/2010
[7:01:00] SonofHorus82: Not for Horde.
[7:01:01] TiredCarcass: not going there
[7:01:05] Alaquane: limegr1Hype quest complete
[7:01:07] Genilort: I hope its a vendor mount forgold
[7:01:10] rolando415: hes back!
[7:01:13] racketpunch: Are you going to raid when you hit 60 or wait on TBC
[7:01:19] youknowimboolin: Stonard
[7:01:21] Fugazi811: that is crazy that an entire zone has no vendors
[7:01:23] robertjordan83: !play
[7:01:35] KhaosDryad: Place is garbage for leveling.  Unless you just buy the quest mats on the AH and turn in.
[7:01:37] Zomgboy: I think at the swamp is closest
[7:01:48] Cielos: It doesn't.
[7:01:50] Utmost777: a small amount
[7:01:51] Toxicityrose: Would it be worth it with Character Boost?
[7:01:54] Mitchendo64: it doesnt
[7:01:57] theszoti: the repeats don't give xp
[7:02:08] Utmost777: oh, i thought it gave like 300xp
[7:02:34] azinverted92: what did you make the gold with?

[7:04:56] Tyrsfal: What is it bout SL that makes oyu feel that way dude?
[7:04:59] TiredCarcass: my guild taking a nap, so its comand table check in
[7:05:01] Mitchendo64: Yes but not as needed @youknowimboolin
[7:05:07] DocsMistake: holy fuck tacos sound good
[7:05:18] MysticalOS: it's nice not having to login for progression. get to play other games. Don't feel guilty I didn't get a days worth of artifact power every day.
[7:05:34] SonofHorus82: who undercuts by that much????
[7:05:39] FalconBroadcasting: Me, lol
[7:06:01] giggity360: AAP sure does make this classic leveling easier
[7:06:10] Saephon: I'm leveling with a casual guild in classic, and it's night and day how involved people are with each other despite not raiding
[7:06:13] xXSiebzehnXx: Ya know, he coulda sucked it
[7:06:17] xXSiebzehnXx: Ducked it
[7:06:22] xXSiebzehnXx: And he didn‚Äôt good on him
[7:06:32] Utmost777: @giggity360 i wish i had tried that. im 52 and ran out of quests for the next 2 levels
[7:06:37] Mitchendo64: Community is everything in mmorpgs
[7:06:53] giggity360: @UtmostOwnage oof
[7:07:12] Mathhbm: i miss wod tbh LUL
[7:07:17] Mitchendo64: I liked Legion
[7:07:18] pavepawns: i miss wod :8
[7:07:35] Saephon: I loved Legion. last expac that really felt good for me

[7:07:37] huemaahn: The amount of illegal guns that get on the street? Good luck lol
[7:07:37] Mitchendo64: If they come out with Classic WoD they better include all the cut content
[7:07:39] Sielu11628: My favorite modern expac is Legion. Favorite "Classic era" is TBC.
[7:07:39] Clawanorder: Miss legion, dont miss BFA one bit
[7:07:48] Tyrsfal: @Towelliee that's so weird, i have critised BFA/Legion before but now i have 'optional' stuff and not mandatory, I now come to appreciate the ARTIFACT wep system mostly
[7:07:57] Solid0Liquid: after i beat denathrius on heroic i knew i was done for a while
[7:08:02] MysticalOS: I feel that's a popular opinion amonst players who want wow to be their only game. they don't want to spend time on anything else. but every other player is happy they aren't forced to feel guilty for not playing only wow
[7:08:27] MysticalOS: sadly it will never be possible to make both player types happy
[7:08:27] Xanigh: i miss mist of pandaria and Legion, suramar was kinda nice if u think about it now, at the start of expansion. nice zone to spend time in and explore
[7:08:36] mizerboy: bring back TW/WF
[7:08:37] Saephon: Legion was probably the best "Class fantasy" we've had in many years, the grind was at least covered up by the roleplay
[7:08:39] Utmost777: what is the upgrade cap now on the sanctum armor?
[7:08:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[7:08:55] caponezz: the hardest thing to get on retail from dungeons are trinkets , after 15 dos`s done , no tank trinket ^^
[7:08:58] GameVelocity: ok so its not just me, ive been doing these mythic dungeons, getting no drops to upgrade
[7:09:01] Willamd: Classic is superior to Shadowlands
[7:09:08] Mitchendo64: Shadowlands that bad that youd rather go back to BFA yikes
[7:09:09] Cryttan: I hated those grinds, but SL def ain't perfect either

[7:09:45] MysticalOS: i feel like removing of endless grind was good. but it had to be replaced with meaningful content. torghast was supposed to be that content but failed utterly
[7:09:49] Mitchendo64: Whitemane Number 1
[7:09:52] Solid0Liquid: a game doesn't seem rewarding unless it rewards your time/effort in some form on your character/s

[7:10:01] 1337RAIDS: what server are you on @towliee
[7:10:27] lae_lae_lae: @Towelliee I have a boomer mentality 30 year old friend who says mtx shop and levelling boost is good for the game cus classic/tbc levelling sucks and I don't know how to not sound like a dick and tell them to play retail if that's what he wants to do lol

[7:10:29] Willamd: Tbc classic has badges which is far superior to the valor system
[7:10:33] Mitchendo64: damn Devs giving up on SL before 9.1 comes out oof
[7:10:37] Fugazi811: if that's the case up the loot
[7:10:39] Katalystgb: do u think they'd be crazy not to do wotlk classic after?
[7:10:40] Cryttan: Gave up on classic at launch because of the massive que's combined with disconnects but def hyped for TBC and i'm ready for the same launch shit show this time.
[7:10:44] efcon: Ppl who have never played Lineage 2 dont know the meaning of grind
[7:10:47] MysticalOS: torghast and the maw are shadowlands real problem. I mean how do you go from something as cool as suramar with actual story, progress etc to something as shitty as maw
[7:10:52] Mirkat98: Is that a weakaura the exp bar at the top?
[7:10:56] bypized: Asmon about to watch your video
[7:10:59] Kahoolo: ^
[7:11:03] lae_lae_lae: Pog
[7:11:05] lae_lae_lae: pog
[7:11:05] MysticalOS: and torghast, is mindlessly boring with poor rewards. when islands gave 100x the rewards of torghast
[7:11:17] Solid0Liquid: shadowlands was supposed to be casual friendly then they did a 360 and walked away
[7:11:20] Sikksakk: Asmon about to watch your video

[7:11:49] Kahoolo: Kahoolo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Asmon about to watch your video
[7:11:49] lae_lae_lae: you were all casuals when you were 12 year olds, that's why the game was great
[7:11:50] Glozki: love it or hate it casuals fund wow
[7:11:57] Nevindaz: @Sikksakk KEKW
[7:11:58] Mathhbm: casual are the msot part of the game LUL
[7:12:00] Tr1kk1: majority of gamers are casuals
[7:12:10] beastboy0503: Blizzard would be bankrupt without the casuals
[7:12:20] Saephon: shit I'm casual now I guess. I'm def not the no lifer I was 10 years ago

[7:12:36] Exodeo_: Retail was a ghost town when classic released tbh, I expect the same for tbc if not worse
[7:12:41] relios898: @Towelliee Do you think they should go the WoD route and abandon Shadowlands early and focus on the next xpac?
[7:12:52] Katalystgb: damned if you do, damned if you dont
[7:12:52] gentukyflex: what server you on
[7:12:53] showmethesugar35: Mine is already lost
[7:12:54] Murlocz: Pretty sure shadowlands gonna be dead at TBC release. At least for couple weeks
[7:12:55] Oracle_WoW: brawlers guild
[7:12:57] lae_lae_lae: my 60 year old dad-in-law stopped playing retail in WoD and only plays classic now KEKW
[7:13:05] MysticalOS: they just need to make torghast and maw not suck. and give us more anima and more things to do with anima
[7:13:06] Kahoolo: They are about to watch it.
[7:13:07] Garrujak: Just make covenants spec based and BOOM casuals are back
[7:13:08] bypized: He hasn't seen it yet, he said he will watch it
[7:13:11] Mitchendo64: The only system i want is the attunement system
[7:13:14] Nevindaz: he is a good guy..
[7:13:15] t_800_i: retail LUL
[7:13:24] FalconBroadcasting: Yeah people that say "Who cares about casuals", are severely misunderstanding how much of the market is that Sect of people they claim to hate. Wow even in 2004 was the casual mmo, and over time, it just bends and twists to appeal best to the biggest demographic that supports it: Casuals.
[7:13:28] Foogalicious: sloot watched it yesyerday lol
[7:13:34] Tyrsfal: can you link the vid ??
[7:13:35] Sielu11628: I was so excited for Shadowlands like no other expansion in the last 10 years. It destroyed me. At this point, I'm going HARD in TBC (will wait for 10.0).
[7:13:39] Layercake: WutFace cmon man
[7:13:41] Secondbreakfasttt: towLul
[7:13:43] Solid0Liquid: we want loot, we don't want systems lol, playing for 4hrs and getting nothing besides anima that you can't spend till next tues doesn't make me wanna play
[7:13:44] happybooger: watch his reaction of your reaction slootLUL

[7:14:28] 1337RAIDS: Have you made the guild for TBC yet ?
[7:14:31] michaelmm: Casual's dontt want systems - they want content! Storylines, exploration goals to work towards - not time gated sanctum unlocks that give 1 extra WQ a day!
[7:14:33] crainiam: payoS
[7:14:37] efcon: one buttn combo wonder. huntard

[7:14:43] lae_lae_lae: @Towelliee wrong, you don't have gore and big no-no words in your vids LUL
[7:14:44] bypized: Asmon loves you man
[7:14:55] shmokindoink: @Ant9912 i think thats what she wants anyways, gotta figure out what i wanna carry with hahaha
[7:15:08] Garrujak: I just want covenants/conduits spec based so I can enjoy the game the way I have ALWAYS enjoyed it
[7:15:16] shmasherd: As a casual Im cool with a grind system as long as it allows me to progress my character. That doesnt exist now
[7:15:19] RquesTR: yeay towel and his shirt is back \0/
[7:15:19] SSD511_: Asmongold chat so toxic talking about your video
[7:15:22] Ant9912: druid is pgood overall if can get the hang of shifting @mikeysahn
[7:15:29] showmethesugar35: But it was boring to farm
[7:15:29] lae_lae_lae: hard choice, neither LUL
[7:15:30] wreckshoptv: islands
[7:15:33] psycho_scythe: Admin defended you against the cringey elitists in his chat. Much love Kreygasm Kreygasm
[7:15:35] Beefnardo: both suck
[7:15:35] mizerboy: legion/bfa - I loved you could get gear, I even miss TF/WF
[7:15:38] Quecklain: neither
[7:15:39] Mitchendo64: @Towelliee I just hated that guilds fell apart so quickly in BFA
[7:15:39] Layercake: I choose none of those
[7:15:40] RquesTR: yea islands was better xD
[7:15:43] RquesTR: free gold really
[7:15:44] Snabido: Dont think those cosmetics had high drop chance on launch, yo
[7:15:44] shmokindoink: @Ant9912 and they get really good in TBC right?

[7:16:01] Garrujak: I just want covenants/conduits spec based so I can enjoy the game the way I have ALWAYS enjoyed it
[7:16:05] mrpresbaby: Islands with the powers
[7:16:08] Kromede: islands nerf hammer: hold my beer
[7:16:09] 1337RAIDS: Are you HORDE OR ALLY ?
[7:16:15] pbnj_kills: they just need a soul ash catch up and i'll be fine
[7:16:16] shmasherd: at least islands was quicker
[7:16:25] happybooger: the only problem i had with islands is the RNG that was linked to the achievements
[7:16:30] lae_lae_lae: i fucking hate twisting corridors, I got to level 3 or 4, only doing it once a day and one little fuck up meant 2 hours down the drain
[7:16:32] Layercake: It's true both are low hanging fruit ''contend''
[7:16:32] TiredCarcass: 150
[7:16:32] wreckshoptv: 120
[7:16:38] Mitchendo64: @Towelliee Remember when Torghast was the most hyped thing about Shadowlands during the beta?
[7:16:44] Ant9912: if youre alliance pally is pgood, priest is also a good compliment in duo lvling @mikeysahn
[7:16:46] Mitchendo64: that was funny
[7:16:49] Roughneck124: Buff up
[7:17:01] psycho_scythe: @1337raids he‚Äôs Californian WutFace
[7:17:16] pbnj_kills: they should let us trade stygia for soul ash since it's not going to be important in 9.1
[7:17:20] michaelmm: Islands did have  varied rewards - far more engaging that a currency.  If they had allowed for exploration they could have been a great feature.
[7:17:25] Unlord: i love dog :)
[7:17:28] shmokindoink: @Ant9912 im between warlock and druid atm
[7:17:34] Ant9912: Druid gets better in BC yeah and hunter is also nice af, both fun too. I play everything lmao, 4 60s and 3 more classes 50+ so im gonna be playin eeverything @mikeysahn
[7:17:36] Ant9912: Druid then
[7:17:39] Ant9912: :P
[7:17:41] lae_lae_lae: @Mitchendo don't forget when they nerfed torghast cus it was too hard LUL
[7:17:44] DeleldurTV: The funny thing is that even on beta i hated Torghast, still hate it on retail :P
[7:17:49] Unlord: well i just got bk to wow 2 week ago and i love SL so far
[7:17:56] Sincline387: if they had kept that, we'd all get told now "I DON'T HAVE 5 HOURS" over and over again
[7:17:56] MysticalOS: and crappy reward structure
[7:17:59] MysticalOS: no leaderboards, etc
[7:18:00] shmokindoink: @Ant9912 yeah i appreciate that advice! I just have a 60 mage and cheated with the aoe grinding hahaha
[7:18:05] Ant9912: ALTHOUGH
[7:18:08] Ant9912: SL/SL lock
[7:18:11] Ant9912: in BC is FUN
[7:18:14] MysticalOS: where are leaderboards, where are titles
[7:18:28] Roughneck124: Buff up
[7:18:31] shmokindoink: I was thinking of using the boost on an SL/SL lock cuz i know i wanna play that in arena
[7:18:34] michaelmm: FWIW I thought it was 8.2 that made BfA - Mechagon added multi layered goal oriented rewards and not much in the way of systems to be found!
[7:18:38] Garrujak: Like everything else Blizz has done lately, they let the fuckhead devs change shit people liked, then ignored all criticism as biased and ruined Torghast
[7:18:39] Ant9912: but im more privy to Druid than Lock
[7:18:42] ThatOneBrownGuy57: are the lvl 52 boosts out on clasic?
[7:18:42] MysticalOS: even M+, they still can't make it as good as wod and mist of pandaria challenge modes. Seriously challenge modes were way better in terms of rewards
[7:18:42] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[7:18:58] MysticalOS: i miss the dungeon titles for the team that currently holds best time on realm for each dungeon
[7:18:59] Mitchendo64: Chat should I should I drop minining to pick up Engineering in Classic?
[7:19:09] Ant9912: Druid is better in an overall setting tho cause you can just heal her pet and you have buffs, etc
[7:19:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: people overhyped torghast, it was clearly just another island content-like just without less rewards.
[7:19:25] Layercake: I don't understand why Blizzard completely shits on M+, they could build an entire ecosystem around that mode. its sad
[7:19:29] shmokindoink: I think she wants to be a night elf anyways, druid seems like the move
[7:19:33] faulen: BC beta in 20 minutes?
[7:19:37] mythradrill: They will never make official leaderboards cause they afraid its gonna weed out the "bad" players and the uproar thats gonna come up with that
[7:19:49] Bakuryuha96: @Layercake cause they dont want it to be better than mythic raiding
[7:19:49] Ant9912: Yeah NE druid bis lol
[7:20:05] Mathhbm: give me 100k for every thog run and im fine
[7:20:15] albertocofi: When is the beta coming out again? i had heard it would come out in april but that was just rumors
[7:20:18] Snabido: Maw of Souls farming was better Kappa
[7:20:19] Ant9912: Im lvling a 2nd druid right now hordeside lol, my 60 is NE
[7:20:38] shmokindoink: I have to watch a shifting vid, i heard its important for energy management
[7:20:38] Avinar: same with world content. then they just pretty much gave us world quests and a handful of other stuff
[7:20:41] MysticalOS: yeah blizzard tends to take the wrong point from people
[7:20:51] Garrujak: Blizzard doesn't listen to feedback, they just ask their moronic devs. They nerfed torghast, refused to listen to complaints about convenants and conduits, and wouldn't balance gear rewards in beta.
[7:20:53] Katalystgb: u know retail is a bit scuffed when all i think about is bc
[7:20:55] firefly_on: change director :)
[7:20:59] Genilort: world quests are so bad
[7:21:09] efcon: ppl hate it but play it anyway= blizzard giving ppl more to feed their masochism.
[7:21:09] Katalystgb: WQ 2.0 is just quests that take longer lol
[7:21:18] Ant9912: I just sat cat form while lvling, but once you get to around 30% hp you wanna shift out and start casting healing touch
[7:21:23] izabeL: Is it beta time?
[7:21:40] tbbex_: Blizzard has a major issue with feedback imo
[7:21:43] michaelmm: Most of the complaints with Islands was the lack of support for exploration and discovery. We had a mass of mini zones but the gameplay loop (race to collect azzo before the timer runs out) made them all feel the same.
[7:21:48] bigrogue_35: why would they give a 1H mace to a fury warrior in the Great Vault. what a jip.
[7:22:06] Avinar: statistics Kappa
[7:22:09] mavericks312: he was praising you
[7:22:15] tbbex_: I think the "fans" they mention are the QAs and Devs
[7:22:20] Sincline387: Towelliee gold
[7:22:33] tbbex_: Not the people who play the game daily, that's for sure
[7:22:37] Ant9912: my 60 druid is feral and im lvling a 2nd one for resto lol and i just enjoy druid alot
[7:22:37] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[7:22:59] Willamd: Badges > valor
[7:23:08] Avinar: I think he just finished with vaults and all done
[7:23:09] efcon: And is he having fun or doign the most effective route?
[7:23:11] tbbex_: Dude, Asmon was doing the Flappy Bird WQ for a couple hrs at one point
[7:23:38] HAPPYDOODY: Hope you are having a wonderful day ya beautiful soul! :)
[7:23:43] TweakT: thasbad
[7:23:46] death_fisted: torghast was a missed opportunity
[7:23:46] gidgeet: Yep
[7:23:50] Mitchendo64: asmongold doesn't do anything relative to the current expansion. He does xmong contests and farms collectives. Doesnt raid doesnt pvp on stream its weird
[7:23:58] Sincline387: expansions are a 1 time purchase, thus the higher drop, they expected that part
[7:23:59] Oracle_WoW: Its gonna happen with people going back to work.
[7:24:04] albertocofi: Isnt that lost revenue what made them release calssic and tbc now?
[7:24:07] Kahoolo: I think now its time to try Arch Age for the first time lol
[7:24:17] MysticalOS: they are hella behind, way more than people even realize
[7:24:17] Sollice: @Kahoolo Ohhhhhh i dont think you want to do that
[7:24:20] Avinar: thats why i kept saying to delay xpac til january or so lol
[7:24:21] Junkt: no problem they need to pay 200 millions bonus haha
[7:24:23] Mitchendo64: The Death of WoW has come, thank god for classic
[7:24:24] MysticalOS: and stretched hella thin
[7:24:26] Mitune: the worst part is the deep desire for wow to do well, but it just tends to fall flat
[7:24:27] tbbex_: It's not the devs who are the issue, its the near impossible deadlines theyre under
[7:24:31] gidgeet: I've stopped playing and I am as casual as they come.. Been enjoying Final Fantasy though
[7:24:33] 1337RAIDS: @Towelliee  How can i get invited to your guild ? id like to join you in your raid for TBC
[7:24:35] Wiiccked: I liked the video, it addressed why I burned out and quit. same with all my irl friends. outside of CE raiding all you do is "work" - was not fun anymore
[7:24:39] Willamd: even when it comes out they will have a surge then and dip again
[7:24:46] Kahoolo: @Kahoolo Why not?
[7:25:11] fooxytv: Any updates on the beta?
[7:25:11] Garrujak: If the systems aren't fun, the content doesn't mean SHIT. Fix torgast, make covenants and conduits spec based, boost loot drops. GGWP game is fixed
[7:25:18] Vile_: If it doesn't come out until August, it WON'T bring me back.
[7:25:19] midagro: When does the 58 boost arrive if anybody knows ofc
[7:25:21] Vile_: That's for damn sure.
[7:25:36] happybooger: do it!
[7:25:38] Katalystgb: WFH probs making life hard tho
[7:25:41] Hybridwarhawk: The return of Type 4
[7:25:41] efcon: Do it!
[7:25:41] death_fisted: the time gating sucks
[7:25:42] shaks1437: Not gonna Bring me back
[7:25:43] WoopWoop10: swtor ftw tho :D
[7:25:43] Goblinemporium: Star Wars again POGGERS
[7:25:44] Kromede: SWTOR POGGERS
[7:25:46] Sincline387: SWTOR who's license runs out in 2 years lol
[7:25:46] Apokolipz: the force is strong in this one
[7:25:47] michaelmm: For casual players it's all about discovery and exploration - until they do more to facilitate that at launch they will continue to spike and sink It was this aspect that made 8.2 a success IMO.
[7:25:47] LucienM: SWTOR LETS GO
[7:25:48] PrimogenitureJ: SWTOR LIFE
[7:25:49] Layercake: They are going to milk BC don't worry
[7:25:50] Mitchendo64: And all they have to do is make Retail like the old ways and they will at least maintain their classic player base
[7:25:54] Layercake: HahaThink
[7:25:56] silvertok: I loved my bounty hunter in swtor
[7:25:56] Janribet: Do you think wow will die?
[7:26:00] Rayman_1990: @midagro noone knows yet, probably some time in the prepatch
[7:26:07] showmethesugar35: Classic is their backup plan
[7:26:11] Avinar: id say time for some ESO but even that is looking rocky
[7:26:12] jiffynuts: FF14 + swtor towHype
[7:26:16] TacoTime_Gaming: i say they scrap retail and start over lol
[7:26:18] Wulfgrym: now patch 9.1 won't come out til September
[7:26:19] midagro: @capcrucnh thanks mate
[7:26:21] Sincline387: people are still buying EQ expansions.....wow isn't ever going to die
[7:26:22] MysticalOS: it's not just work from home, they are understaffed in many departments. certain departments, like engine, work on ALL games, not just one. shadowlands engine is still kinda buggy because they've had to pause fixing it to get TBC ready, to get diablo 4 ready, etc
[7:26:26] Mitchendo64: Dont forget about ESO @Towelliee
[7:26:33] mavericks312: they need to be ready when they can get back in the officer to blow it away though
[7:26:35] atowellthatiallreadyused: hyped for obi wan series or andor ? im personally hyped af about ashoka
[7:26:35] Mitune: I wonder if retail did 'fail' if they would invest in new classic content expansions
[7:26:38] death_fisted: koteck isn't worried with his 200 million
[7:26:43] MysticalOS: server, engine, way too understaffed for increasing number of games
[7:26:45] Genilort: they are worried that all play the old expansion compared to retail
[7:26:47] efcon: @MysticalOS Smol indy campeny?
[7:26:51] Tyrsfal: @Towelliee WoW could use some of that Bobby Kotik $200m bonus amirite
[7:27:07] Apokolipz: monkaSoap  all big concerts in st louis have been postponned again due to covid numbers
[7:27:17] MysticalOS: @efcon when most of money going to shareholders and ceo and not toward expanding development, might as well be
[7:27:33] Wulfgrym: @Tyrsfal its not really a money problem, its more of a logistics problem imo
[7:27:34] Saephon: I just can't get over how many people are annoyed with ESO combat, and they won't do anything about it. that game would be so damn perfect otherwise
[7:27:50] mavericks312: @Apokolipznow most places are holding off big events like that till the end of the summer fall to have time to let more ppl get vaccinated
[7:28:06] xhaven: Nope I love ESO combat the way it is please leave it alone monkaS
[7:28:30] Genilort: eso combat for pve is good, but eso combat for pvp just dont work, here wow works much better
[7:29:29] Avinar: ESO combat is actually one of the only reasons I don't play it lol I don't like it
[7:29:51] t_800_i: the servers are dogshit in ESO
[7:30:03] Genilort: for some season I hate it too, but somehow I find it fun in pve
[7:30:19] t_800_i: you cant pvp with that performance...

[7:30:24] this_reformed_bird: !YT
[7:30:48] Avinar: I mean I like not standing still, but the bar swapping, skills, interactions, idk it's just kinda off for me
[7:31:00] xhaven: I do mostly play ESO for the Pve content, so you could be right but most people play it for pve too. I wouldnt mind if ESO does some changes for combat for pvp only but Im afraid that any changes like that ultimately affects pve and then alienates the pve crowd its happened to other mmos in the past.

[7:32:53] Vexxsis: get gud
[7:33:15] xhaven: lol yea not every game is for all people I guess, I personally tried Final Fantasy repeatedly before realizing it just wasnt for me

[7:33:44] Genilort: final fantasy had like dialog for 3 hours and I quit so fast
[7:34:21] Miguel85NYC: im playing FF14 as we speak lol
[7:34:23] Kromede: i get headache with ESO, ELVUi and wildstar. weird, must be something with FoV - field of view
[7:34:31] xhaven: I powered through that because everyone says FF has a great story but I still couldnt get into it PepeHands
[7:34:47] Miguel85NYC: did you play any of the expansions @xhaven ?
[7:34:53] MoodyVanessa: i tried playing FFXIV twice i wasnt able to play for that long because of the cutscene that cant be skipped so annoying

[7:35:29] evilmech: only unskippable cutscenes are the last 2 8man dungeons
[7:35:34] Kromede: i stopped ff14, low level dungeons are horrible and you rly can't skip them FeelsBadMan
[7:35:35] xhaven: @Miguel85NYC no I never did, I was planning to try again for shadowbringers but I never went back
[7:35:42] evilmech: of the original game
[7:35:49] Miguel85NYC: The story gets much better
[7:35:51] Nehcrom: @Kromede I feel you.
[7:36:04] Miguel85NYC: Heavnwards is my favorite expansion for FF 14
[7:36:04] Kromede: yay Nehcrom towHi

[7:36:55] Nehcrom: But lvling up the other jobs... omg.
[7:36:59] xhaven: I feel like its the characters and settings in FF I dont like though @Miguel85NYC
[7:36:59] happybooger: @Towelliee do you think that Covenants are working as Blizz wants or do you think that they will pick between them at some point?

[7:37:24] Zomgboy: I hope I get beta too KEKW
[7:37:28] Zomgboy: got classic one
[7:37:36] Avinar: The world feels bland in FF14. it's a beautiful panting but nothing going on. All the story is around just a few characters and not much else going on.

[7:48:38] Mitchendo64: boosting just supports gold sellers
[7:48:51] Wulfgrym: lol that would be great raf and boost in tbc
[7:49:10] Wulfgrym: these people don'
[7:49:24] Murlocz: He said "2 months of prepatch is enough to get 60  since there will be a lot of ppl leveling". I dont think 2 months are enough for casuals, plus in PVP servers are going to be a shit show
[7:49:25] Wulfgrym: don't care themselves
[7:49:34] Mitchendo64: get into BC with zero gold so they buy it
[7:49:46] all_beef_franks: people need to realize you WANT more people at max level to play with, not less.. the boost will be fine
[7:49:51] Wulfgrym: people who say boosting supports botters is using gorilla math
[7:49:52] Murlocz: Gold Sellers and Botting is a Blizzard issue, its on them so solve that
[7:50:03] Stackamo: RaF would be a stupid idea most of the people who are gonna play tbc already have a blizzard account
[7:50:06] Venkxx: why would bots even buy the boost?
[7:50:10] Exodeo_: Botting situation is horrid in retail too ;p
[7:50:11] Rayman_1990: I remember that funny "scroll of ressurection" thing. When u gifted levels to ur friend , unaware ppl were like: "wtf is this cheating"
[7:50:16] off_metas: where should i go at level 21?
[7:50:43] Kromede: botters want money, they don't want to spend money
[7:50:43] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[7:50:44] Mitchendo64: I agree but boosting supports it even more.
[7:50:49] Wulfgrym: well if they don't like the boost they are welcome to stay in tbc wehre they claim it was the best ever
[7:50:50] KillaPr0: always going to be cheaters
[7:51:18] Murlocz: Tbh i dont care about Boosts, about recruit a friend, any of that, Store mounts for TBC sounds kinda yikes for me tho
[7:51:34] mavericks312: the boost alone will help tbc go thru the roof and ppl dont realize it

[7:53:16] efcon: go back to retail!
[7:53:23] PhillyDilly18: @Towelliee Do you think the people against the boost would trade the boost for shareable nodes or any other anti-bot measures?
[7:53:32] Rayman_1990: blizz obviously dont care bout bots, they could end them instantly if they rly want
[7:53:38] Miguel85NYC: I'm glad they adding Boosting to TBC, I aint got time to level to 60 so I can enjoy the expansion I really want to play
[7:53:43] MisterElectric: Blizzard had never gotten bots under control since 2005 when I started.
[7:53:47] Mitchendo64: naw all my friends quit wow back in catra
[7:53:48] Mitchendo64: cata
[7:53:54] kharnij83: but WAS it a Liter of Cola?
[7:53:58] Malnar1123: It's such backwards logic...blizzard has the tech to stop botting. And if they don't, take a small chunk of that 200 million bonus to figure it out. hurting your player base is such a dumb, victim-blamey solution.
[7:54:00] Stackamo: dropping the truth with this music
[7:54:01] Kromede: store mounts - take my money

[7:55:08] Wulfgrym: more cashshop!
[7:55:23] DreavT2K: transmog GO!
[7:55:27] 2MakeMe: The biggest problem i see with this is that so many streamers and influencers say that the leveling experience is great but all they did was fuking dungeon level after talking constantly on how great the leveling experience is. So i dont want to hear bout this and that bout fuking leveling
[7:55:36] Kromede: "we" don't like changes BabyRage

[8:01:56] KillaPr0: game does not change will eventually die
[8:01:58] ofnaldreya: @Towelliee In a hypothetical world would you be down for some sort of classic/tbc + situation. Where they keep the major systems but make extra content or turning changes? It seems to me like the logical (and good) next step for #somechanges scenario

[8:21:24] tyrel_jones: @Garrujak GGs to Discord now that microsoft about to ruin it
[8:21:51] N64atNite: microsoft bought skype too and killed it
[8:21:53] Putcride: If discord had stock i'd buy it just to have microsoft stock
[8:21:53] Plague_GG: I was on skywall for vanilla/bc
[8:21:55] mavericks312: yea but microsofts track record isnt taht great
[8:21:57] drwest132: microsoft should buy discord

[8:23:18] drwest132: facts
[8:23:20] Garrujak: If blizzard doesn't make 10.0 good Im about to no life wrath and feel 13 again
[8:23:28] PvtHudson093: no thanks
[8:23:33] Stackamo: cant wait for BFA classic
[8:23:36] Kahoolo: Legion Classic lol
[8:23:38] Harch: i would take cata if it meant we got MOP
[8:23:41] BlockishTiger: stop at litch, but add in the new classes/races we have now? would be interesting
[8:23:44] N64atNite: people want MoP classic
[8:23:47] Apokolipz: classic pandaria
[8:23:49] Garrujak: @mavericks312 in 2 years we'll be using a new server/voip service after microsoft dicks Discord into uselessness
[8:23:53] TacoTime_Gaming: after wrath start a new timeline cause you know chromie stuff
[8:23:53] tyrel_jones: im tellin yall... WoW 2.0 Classic will be the best
[8:24:03] tyrel_jones: just wait til 2032
[8:24:06] FalconBroadcasting: Like, Classic Cata would be cool and all, but to be honest, you can do that in Retail right now. The core experience such as the quest zones, dungeons, and raids are still there. You can just go see it there.
[8:24:12] mavericks312: @Garrujak also a very good possibility now
[8:24:43] ancestral_16: I feel like they might try and do Mists classic and possibly Legion.
[8:25:01] Putcride: Av?
[8:25:01] efcon: BFA classic
[8:25:05] MisterElectric: AV
[8:25:10] Exodeo_: I miss legion, was the last expansion i enjoyed
[8:25:21] Kromede: legion classic KEKW
[8:25:26] Apokolipz: alteric valley classic :O
[8:25:27] tyrel_jones: Classic is everything before Cata... to me
[8:25:30] Harch: yeah but by the time it is MoP it will be the same length of time as classic tbc
[8:25:33] tyrel_jones: because that was the BIG change
[8:25:37] xiamrs: shadowlands classic
[8:25:38] mavericks312: the scary thing is when wrath comes out cata will almost be 14 years old and clasic cata could actually happen
[8:25:39] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee yeah but you know damn well they release Legion you gonna play it again KEKW
[8:25:41] CritcobainTV: it was so good
[8:25:49] BlockishTiger: then they can have dedicated servers to classic, BC, and Wrath.
[8:26:01] Garrujak: Classic denotes when the game style was fundamentally different, cata is the sign of the new game style
[8:26:03] Brodih_: the ''Classic world'' = pre-Cata
[8:26:09] ancestral_16: I feel like that is going to be their reasoning is to make that quick buck
[8:26:13] FalconBroadcasting: (now we're spitting hotfire) Honestly, I didn't even think they needed to go past Vanilla Classic.
[8:26:14] Harch: they will just keep making classic era stuff until it becomes not profitable, it's that simple
[8:26:17] tyrel_jones: @Garrujak absolutely
[8:26:53] Rayman_1990: Classic classic in 2040 Kappa
[8:27:06] SicDogg: yea
[8:27:08] Jokervenom1978: Leveling cooking
[8:27:08] Harch: being able to re release already made content (games/movies etc) is a companies wet dream and they're not going to let it go
[8:27:12] Velarn435: Hunter pets
[8:27:51] Malnar1123: MadSeason complaining about the Deluxe Edition already xD
[8:27:59] TwitchPlusMe: you think you do...
[8:28:24] TacoTime_Gaming: Cata should have never happened.
[8:28:28] efcon: lets see who get the last laught.
[8:28:40] Malnar1123: He retweeted it saying: "Uh Oh"
[8:28:43] Kromede: i want to play wow alpha
[8:29:14] FalconBroadcasting: I would be incredibly interested in a Wow Alpha. The crustier the better.
[8:29:45] t_800_i: i  WANT TBC RIGHT NOW
[8:29:51] Malnar1123: I think they're assuming its a TBC in game reward and they dont want you to have to buy a more expensive version of the game to get a mount? That's my guess
[8:29:53] tyrel_jones: i loathe the "no changes" andys. so fucking hilarious

[8:31:05] tyrel_jones: they are a very, very strange breed of homosapien @Towelliee
[8:31:10] Malnar1123: I bet their argument is that not only do you get a "free" level 58 character...now you ALSO get a free mount that I HAD TO PAY FOR. That'
[8:31:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: Warpburger mount giveaways should be on Lula's stream LUL
[8:31:23] x_Davincii: but it has to be exactly how it was dood LUL Kappa
[8:31:23] kitkatmeel: i wonder if the TBC classic collectors edition will have a cool statue like the rag statue

[8:31:55] Deathu: I think his issue is whit adding content that was never in the game in the first place ? @Towelliee like imagine if instead of ilidan they replaced him with idk garosh or something xD
[8:32:09] Malnar1123: Exactly...it's more of a reflection on their general fear of change and distrust in irrelevant systems than any specific change
[8:32:18] Beezler: check for vulture gizzards
[8:32:22] Mitune: I want change and new content , but it a way that maintains the things that makes tbc great. so #somechanges for the sake potentially new stuff in the future
[8:32:26] Wrex82: looking forward to the asmon and staysafe raids where they funnel all gear to their alts... for integrity of the game.
[8:32:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: that mount is bag space so thats a pretty heavy cost LUL
[8:32:40] Malnar1123: @deathu But they're not doing that lol someone riding a mount doesn't change your experience at all. why do you care?
[8:32:46] Brodih_: north of ashenvale
[8:32:47] efcon: @neverbornlucky that is why smart ppl roll the new races

[8:33:29] Stackamo: @Towelliee something must be wrong with blizzard i havent got my beta key yet
[8:33:36] staboca: very true
[8:33:38] neverbornlucky: Efcon it not just the new races. One area was right when you went to outland and you had to kill those mobs  and collect the wood and metal
[8:33:43] Deathu: @51Nocaster It kinda does, that mount was never in the game, and the only way to get it is to buy the collector's edditon, i don't mind when they add a level boost or stuff like transfers but adding content like a new zone mount items idk
[8:33:48] Saucetonia: then be like "man theres nothing to do"
[8:33:50] Stackamo: cheers

[8:34:34] efcon: @neverbornlucky then stay a while and lsiten to the awesome music
[8:34:37] Mitune: dirty water dog, grilled, boiled or microwaved @towelliee
[8:34:43] Vodkanic: mmm I want some hotdogs
[8:34:44] Malnar1123: @deathu its fine if you dont like it...but dont equate a simple mount with adding or changing an entire zone or the guy on the front of the box.
[8:34:50] just_kirk_: man I bet Lula can make a hell of a chili dog

[9:26:48] Bashcutter: @Towelliee You think I'll be able to play if I downloaded the client without being flagged?
[9:26:51] Wulfgrym: The fel reaver kicked out towelliee
[9:26:54] Exxcar: @Kromede that's cause he is using the TBC client and those are Vanillia PTR servers, thus his client is incompatible

[9:27:39] Drogdorf: towLewd
[9:27:45] bapele45: so there is going to be 2 games? one classic and one bc? they are not merged together?

[9:28:15] bapele45: ah so everyone is going to leave classic then and go bc
[9:28:22] serenitieez: This is just a question, Not a flame. I've beta tested more than my fair share of games. Including Warcraft 3. Yet i havn't gotten any beta invite for any of the wow expansions i played when it came out. Yet special treatment always is given to Content creators. I know its a free publicity. But their are others that arn't streamers that can offer alot to bug testing.
[9:28:25] nbandi: there will be classic vanilla and tbc classic which includes vanilla classic
[9:28:27] bapele45: so classic is dead ?
[9:28:30] Phansolenth: You still working out?
[9:28:30] Ribbwich: @bapele45 it's implied that they had something in mind for Classic.
[9:28:31] Rayman_1990: @bapele45 ppl who desire to stay in classic will get their char transferred to perma classic realms
[9:28:31] Exxcar: @Bashcutter nope, you HAVE to be flagged, having the files means nothing
[9:28:31] gidgeet: maybe a few dungeons to see how they are lol
[9:28:33] BlewGamingGroup: lets hurry up and get to 70 so we can wait for everyone else to catch up
[9:28:33] Mahca_: for real, enjoy the game

[9:29:43] Ribbwich: @Towelliee they aren't ready to talk about how Legion is the best WoW Expac
[9:29:45] shinta__: is it ok to ask to join the guild if you will play TBC casually?
[9:29:49] serenitieez: This is just a question, Not a flame. I've beta tested more than my fair share of games. Including Warcraft 3. Yet i havn't gotten any beta invite for any of the wow expansions i played when it came out. Yet special treatment always is given to Content creators. I know its a free publicity. But their are others that arn't streamers that can offer alot to bug testing.
[9:29:52] PvtHudson093: Wheres Legion TW?
[9:29:59] Vexxsis: month a week at least
[9:30:00] BlewGamingGroup: 5-6 weeks

[9:30:03] Rjmar: 6 weeks to level
[9:30:07] qwerth: i would like 2 months there will be a whole unique meta that we will never see again

[9:30:24] Nertok12: i hope only 4 weeks that we get real tbc in june
[9:30:28] serenitieez: Yea i feel that man.. Like i said no flame. Im just frustrated
[9:30:30] gidgeet: yep
[9:30:33] oCambot: test Kappa
[9:30:41] Vexxsis: lmao

[9:33:04] 1337RAIDS: im  also waiting for the servers.
[9:33:05] Exxcar: @Towelliee the key is that if you aren't a content creator, and you DO get lucky enough to get in, then you gotta test the living s**t out of the game. Provide a ton of good feedback. You show you're a great tester, your chances will probably become higher to get into future ones
[9:33:10] 1337RAIDS: i got in then got kicked out also .
[9:33:10] FAN_FROM_TIKTOK: So it will be out today or we waiting for nothing

[9:33:50] Broomba: other than watching the hype of a new expansion or beta, the waiting game is the best and most memorable @towelliee
[9:33:53] Kahoolo: What made you switch to Horde in retail?
[9:33:56] Harch: that's all they needed to test
[9:34:00] Infinitepeeep: yeah that few moments of looking at the portal was the entire beta

[10:55:58] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i thought you said TBC is easier leveling than classic KEKW
[10:56:01] Hellifyoudont66: I think your boosted gear is worse than you'd have dungeoning up to 58.
[10:56:05] SlowpokeIsAGamer: This is what happens when you take pre-nerf Outland and combine it with boosted characters in levels-below-58 greens.
[10:56:07] Knocx: the old judgement animation, uuuuuuuuuuh love it
[10:56:09] MiniPenny: You went to the wrong mobs :D You should go to the demons to the east. You can kill them easier for starters. :D

[11:03:08] SlowpokeIsAGamer: 58 in some generic greens instead of dungeon gear.
