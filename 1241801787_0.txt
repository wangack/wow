[0:31:38] fergusonac: what's his current rank?!?!
[0:31:50] dee_lish: @un_heilig Yeah dood super frustrating. I am poo at PVP and i dont understand why people are allowed to be level 40 and camp a level 10 area and just ruin your day ?? That one aspect of WoW almost completely ruins the game for me. It made me quit re release classic when i started playing for the first time ever. Now i am on PVE server but OCE server pop is so low i may as well just play normal DEAD classic
[0:32:06] Mariussnekkevik: Currently R9 12%
[0:32:07] Jkfaked: I remember making a night elf warrior back in 2007 and listening to the incredible swifty tricks video (wcm) as background music while I was questing peepoHappy time flies man.

[0:34:22] wherleybird55: if your always at the top no one can betray you haha
[0:34:36] Gizimoo86: My R10 felt pretty good, i think R11/R12 is enough fo me
[0:34:44] Enmael00: what do you mean? you will rank 14 a druid next
[0:35:06] VairoTheLeaf: Hey Swifty, been watching your videos for a long time (incredible warrior tricks). Haven't been able to catch a stream for a while. How are you enjoying WoW? :)
