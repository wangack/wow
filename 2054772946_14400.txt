[5:08:53] Tony2362: he's takin it DrakeWide
[5:08:58] sleeplesswolf94: does it matter when it was? shouldve taken it to be over with this and just paid the loan off
[5:08:59] DuckSmoke_: Why would you take a loan from the same guy that's been stealing from your gang and hard balling you on your own house?
[5:09:01] sleeplesswolf94: couldve had the house
[5:09:02] Lizzurdx: It's not your house now lmao

[5:10:10] sleeplesswolf94: @Duck_Mallardly cause cam had a slight change of heart for a moment and was like well why i dont just give u a loan so u can pay whats owed and get the house. now he has no house hahahaha
[5:10:45] PAID_ACTOR1: so we were right this whole time @5L4Y3R om
[5:10:47] DuckSmoke_: Change of heart? LMAO he was just trying to get even more money from them because there would be interest on the loan.
[5:10:55] 5L4Y3R: @PAID_ACTOR1 graycenYEP
[5:10:55] PAID_ACTOR1: cam squad rekt gary
[5:11:04] jazzmaggot: saddest gang shit in history
[5:11:07] BUTHEDD_: He would have made them pay interest and sign a contract that says if they dont pay the house is transferred back
[5:11:11] 5L4Y3R: cum squad disentegrated
[5:11:14] PunkiBruiser: is this what we are doing?
[5:11:18] GrandmasCloset: damn toby kjeith died
[5:11:18] DuckSmoke_: And Cam would be the one to write the loan so he'd set it up in a way that makes it hard for them to pay off and if they don't pay in time he keeps the house anyway.
[5:11:35] PAID_ACTOR1: god it feels good to be proven right
[5:11:41] PAID_ACTOR1: gachiHYPER
[5:11:45] sleeplesswolf94: @Duck_Mallardly so instead of paying maybe slightly more money u rather turn the down loan and stop making money from other avenues that a house provides... got it so lose more money in the end
[5:12:11] DuckSmoke_: Just take a loan from someone else, Cam isn't the only guy giving out loans.
[5:12:13] PAID_ACTOR1: dirty sewers
[5:12:15] sleeplesswolf94: lol chat and garys bad at money management long term

[5:13:59] ear_shot: cause im tryin to glaze
[5:13:59] Usahi_Light: lecithin,, arginine, etc
[5:14:03] sleeplesswolf94: @Usahi_Light chat forgets that part.
[5:14:08] Usahi_Light: no meme you will
[5:14:15] DuckSmoke_: Trusting a guy that's shown to be untrustworthy is what bit them in the ass.
[5:14:23] sleeplesswolf94: its a contract
[5:14:26] sleeplesswolf94: he cant just fuck u
[5:14:27] PAID_ACTOR1: @Usahi_Light om says to the guy who already got fucked
[5:14:29] Usahi_Light: Yes but trusting a literal legally enforcable contract is different
[5:14:51] BUTHEDD_: no we specifically said 2 people said that cam would be the one writing the contract with loopholes to fuck over the squad we werent ignoring the contract
[5:15:01] sleeplesswolf94: nah yall didnt
[5:15:02] Usahi_Light: The house had no contract, talk to a lawyer and get a legally enforced contract and you'll be fine
[5:15:10] sleeplesswolf94: yall just assume he would fuck gary
[5:15:18] BUTHEDD_: @Duck_Mallardly heres the other one
[5:15:20] DuckSmoke_: @Usahi_Light Cam would demand that he write up the contract, and the only one that might consider getting their own lawyer is Fancy, and even then he might not.
[5:15:24] PAID_ACTOR1: reagardles all these genius suggestions from chat dont matter, gary is not chat or chat's wisdom
[5:15:31] PAID_ACTOR1: it would be meta and stupid to use chat
[5:15:31] BUTHEDD_: scroll up 2 of us did say that
[5:15:32] LMAOBRUHLOLXD: chat giving reasonable and legal takes, bro just ocean dump cam till he gives eveything back BasedGod

[5:16:03] PAID_ACTOR1: @LMAOBRUHLOLXD BASED
[5:16:25] DuckSmoke_: @Usahi_Light That would require a level of thinking yet to be displayed here.
[5:16:30] Usahi_Light: I did like that Cam's character doesnt think everyone was stupid enough to believe the raid was legit and  Gary openly admits they are
[5:16:31] sleeplesswolf94: at no point did anyone say he had to do it, i just laughed that he didnt take it.  there yall go assuming things were said
[5:16:33] sleeplesswolf94: its funny af
[5:16:55] starbaby888: 🫨
