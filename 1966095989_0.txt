[2:04:35] Yermoh_G: OHNO Worororo
[2:04:35] Landarokz: What is a woyer?
[2:04:35] STFNxdd: He can use it when he needs it this way, instead of it dying imediatlyu
[2:04:36] gank_zilla: @sodapoppin mes kept his dismissed until he wanted to finish
[2:04:38] opuhol: But still , its 20% of the dmg

[2:04:43] erousagi: many hunters start with no pats and only summon when needed, which kinda works
[2:04:46] adhdtiva: Owl makes him reduced damage but the rage trade is hard
[2:04:49] LogBro: u keep it in stealth for finisher
[2:04:50] handgestured: Its not just rage, you also get enrage procs and blood craze if they spec into that
[2:04:51] BroxigarZ: I think while Diamond Flask is up its just free rage, don't bring it out until it can do damage.

[2:05:05] Wak88: he is a hunter not a ranger this is a disqualification imo
[2:05:06] Laaash: he's just keeping it in stealth till jaelaw is out of options ye
