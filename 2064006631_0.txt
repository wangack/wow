[1:25:14] Enazx: tough
[1:25:18] lennetth171174: nice  warlock  damage
[1:25:26] whiteboy1136: if he runs blood moon pvp tal he gets a chance to get a demon proc on purge and it still increases your damage by like 20%......just a thought
[1:25:30] taruninja88: ur still doing a shit dton of damage though
[1:25:36] bigjut205: the cc is real 😂
[1:25:45] cory_lockman: cloned your meta tho :/
[1:25:45] 2morebeers: druid needs to get a cd to clones... so it cant be chained like that
[1:25:52] Torbzen: wow great job hitting 1-2-3-4 on DH! haha jk jk (or am I? ;)
[1:25:55] Torbzen: )

[1:26:34] blesns: how does pika have Gladius?
[1:26:38] lennetth171174: the best at putting cyclones is smiyan
[1:26:39] chadley12333: use cc to be annoying not to win
[1:26:49] poroyou: If its anything like my shuffle games just que into double melee and get zugzug'd the entire game
[1:26:50] vilecurse_01: Other than using immolation aura to cleanse roots I don't see a lot of mistakes
[1:26:59] Boomer_Brian: another good gym sesh?
[1:27:03] boocraft1992: !addons
[1:27:03] Nightbot: Gladius, TrufiGCD, Details, and Omnibar, Pika uses default UI for everything else
[1:28:13] vmills: that rdruid has a cool name
[1:28:36] TimmyShoes: nightbot outdated - pika also uses omnicd (to track team cds) and i think a bag addon
[1:28:45] lazygj: what keyboard do you use
[1:29:59] lennetth171174: The warlock begins to apply pressure from the middle of the arena
[1:30:34] atorob: Nice!
[1:30:57] Twistedysondre: BOP
[1:31:04] atorob: nah you should be ooming healers by sitting dps, you put out so much dmg theyll get wrecked
[1:31:10] sx0_: what demon hunter breed are you
[1:31:28] NerdEngineering: what team's are your prepping this comp for?
[1:31:43] KluttsVonSnuggs: doordash it got it
[1:31:50] Dartaru: you dont like dh pika? you dont seem to be enjoying it
[1:31:53] Nvellen: howre the 3s going man
[1:31:56] chopsaki: do you have a playlist for your music? youtubes or spotify??
[1:32:07] blesns: yo pika how do you have gladius?
[1:32:15] Maaybees: how many people do you think take addys in the tourneys lol
[1:32:15] hybridvig0r: @Dartaru zoomer Stigma
[1:32:34] Aurnilon: I hope that happens
[1:32:35] nubcake_: DH feels one dimensional, just mash damage and that’s about it. vs rogue which is satisfying to win with
[1:32:46] TimmyShoes: best pvp races. S tier - night elf. a tier - human, orc, dark iron dwarf, undead. B tier - gnome (S tier for warrior but not much else) D tier - everyone else. agree or disagree?
[1:32:47] reavethederp: nerf everything down to dh level
[1:32:55] snowfalllllll: fistweaver warrior ret has to be most cancer rn
[1:32:56] ToeBooty: Resto druids are pretty tough in low mmr areans, do you think shamans hold that title in the level you play or is it still druids/
[1:32:58] ahawkes54: yooooo
[1:33:04] ahawkes54: check out Tren's vids
[1:33:05] atorob: they need to nerf blur, make them glass cannons
[1:33:05] juicebox888: Thoughts on Resto Shaman, Boomkin and Combat Rogue?
[1:33:07] bigjut205: shit I been waiting for them to bring back aff lock I miss my main 🤣 🤣 😢
[1:33:30] ericpowerful: does dh throw glaive a lot
[1:33:40] chinchin23: DH main dafudge
[1:33:44] Wrbursch: whats a combat rouge?
[1:33:57] Ronedh: @ericpowerful everytime you blade dance
[1:34:06] chinchin23: i wish retail was good still i like arena i just hate looking for people to play with
[1:34:08] chadley12333: there must be a bunch of wow devs that main DH, shit has been like this for years
[1:34:13] monkazug: lol combat is outlaw
[1:34:19] Jplague21: Like Maldiva was saying, affliction lock isn't really going to come back unless they get massive changes...Like getting rid of mandatory 3 UA PvP talent
[1:34:26] imagamerbby: alright chat, who was here for the porsche startup the other night?! that shit was wild! stream was turnt all the way up!
[1:34:27] monkazug: combat was a rogue spec changed to outlaw
[1:34:36] SwiisH_Tv: @chadley12333 Devs dont pvp kekw
[1:35:07] chadley12333: @swiish_tv but when they do, they play DH
[1:35:08] christiger51653: @imagamerbby need more of that stream
[1:35:11] hybridvig0r: boomies
[1:35:15] Ronedh: @chadley12333 pvp hasnt changed much now that we have gear, but at the beginning of the season we ran a more pve esque build
[1:35:17] atorob: it doesnt matter, they can nerf dh and ppl will just cry about another class, its a never ending cycle
[1:35:24] lennetth171174: lock  time
[1:35:27] varok87: @monkazug i missed the Combat Rogue Red Buff.
[1:35:49] Jplague21: DH is just designed in a way that allows the class to excel in PvP. That's all there is to it
[1:35:56] Caidrox: @atorob ppl crying about something and a class obviously being busted are 2 different things tho
[1:36:02] Ronedh: They will nerf dh, and people will complain just because they hate the class PrideShrug
[1:36:05] chrisiirc: AlienDance
[1:36:21] FateIRL: dh is s+ omega shenron , at lest nerf it to s tier
[1:36:25] SwiisH_Tv: @chadley12333 Devs be like "we have pvp in the game"?
[1:36:30] chadley12333: nah DH class design is unlike any other class, perma flying around the map doing highest dps in game
[1:36:35] chinchin23: i reckon a good system for arena would be qeue CR bracket of 200 cr dif or 300 for higher games and qeue some sort of LFG system will find people around your lvl so you can talk to them via message in that seprate chat box
[1:36:47] atorob: @Caidrox if they nerf dh, you dont think something else will take that S tier spot???
[1:37:12] Caidrox: @atorob not without buffing it big time. Dh is in a class of its own rn and that gotta go
[1:37:14] FateIRL: outlaw by default
[1:37:17] FateIRL: because its already S
[1:37:22] malakaidh: destro is way more of a problem then dh
[1:37:40] chadley12333: @atorob bad take noob
[1:37:41] atorob: a class getting gutted also indirectly buffs other classes usually as well
[1:37:42] FateIRL: thats a cooked take lol
[1:37:55] nooblordxd: dh just isnt fun to play against is the problem i'd rather something be strong thats more fun to fight
[1:37:59] FateIRL: destro just gets trained and can actually die
[1:38:02] SwiisH_Tv: @dreamss____ nah because when your destro and you have a dh on you, you get fukt
[1:38:04] FateIRL: dh is unkillable
[1:38:09] FateIRL: and does the most dam
[1:38:34] malakaidh: @nooblordxd yea bc sp and lock is rly fun to face!
[1:38:36] atorob: oh i agree its busted, but i dont think gutting it is the answer, hit their defensives and buff some  other specs
[1:38:37] monkazug: nothings unkillable in a cc chain
[1:39:05] SwiisH_Tv: honestly the only class that kept dhs in check were sub rogues... they gutted them now theyre running rampant
[1:39:09] chinchin23: most classes people hate are DH, LOCKS in general , Rdruid metas , RMP , D basically eeverything else people can handle for the most part
[1:39:17] feiguy6: i wouldnt mind dh being deleted from the game
[1:39:27] monkeeztailz: bruhh....like cc hell
[1:39:41] lennetth171174: The druid is the worst enemy of the dhs with roots and cyclones
[1:39:45] nubcake_: @chinchin23 most hated classes are easily DH and rets IMO
[1:39:53] ericpowerful: sub rogue "gutted" XD
[1:39:53] chinchin23: i feel like CC needs to be less still in this game more micro cc than full CCs
[1:39:56] chadley12333: remove ele sham/DH and the game gets way better
[1:39:57] FateIRL: i love steel trapping a dumb dh
[1:40:01] FateIRL: on cd
[1:40:04] malakaidh: just look at this game a destro lock is out dmging a dh while the dh cleaving demo pets + a ele on the other team vs a lock ?? and dh is the problem
[1:40:06] Skurt971: it's just horrible to see so many cc's
[1:40:38] chinchin23: Rdruid meta is pepega and snore fest but thats just me
[1:40:44] FateIRL: dreams is a dh player
[1:40:45] FateIRL: 100% lol
[1:40:50] louislouis19: don’t think I’ve ever seen pika get duked so many times! This lock is gaming
[1:41:03] chinchin23: as a healer main i have hated DH most when they had mana Burn
[1:41:04] FateIRL: doesnt negate the fact dh is immortal and has a lower death rate in arena than rdruid
[1:41:14] malakaidh: @FateIRL is what im saying wrong?
[1:41:20] lennetth171174: the shaman is dry of mana yes
[1:41:26] malakaidh: ok the same thing can be said about outlaw lol?
[1:41:32] fovven: why do you dislike the meta?  It seems like this was like one of the most diverse AWCs we’ve had.  the last couple metas had such poor class diversity compared to now.
[1:41:35] chrisiirc: pika doesnt like it
[1:41:35] waterfeesh: POG
[1:41:36] chrisiirc: lol
[1:41:38] vilecurse_01: So thirsty
[1:41:40] SwiisH_Tv: @dreamss____ yupp DH main found
[1:41:40] FateIRL: ya and outlaw is S+ as well lol
[1:41:40] juicebox888: so much cc with druid + lock
[1:41:42] waterfeesh: LOL
[1:41:43] FateIRL: needs  anerf
[1:41:44] ferahgok: agreed
[1:41:48] wzrdtrx_tv: hell ya dh BatChest
[1:41:55] chinchin23: well Outlaw is a bit silly with Cd reductions and unlimikted CC
[1:42:00] bollskis: look at cc rec
[1:42:00] chinchin23: rogues
[1:42:01] 253templar: tank meta was actual death
[1:42:05] snowfalllllll: if they remove clone game would be so much better
[1:42:06] Wrbursch: maybe sterge will give you some tips about dh

[1:42:30] davErosEe: rogue is far better than dh
[1:42:39] skew_yew: that’s the build
[1:42:45] chinchin23: you cant vanish or cloak haha unlucky
[1:42:46] nubcake_: sub angle??
[1:42:48] fovven: why do you dislike the meta?  It seems like this was like one of the most diverse AWCs we’ve had.  the last couple metas had such poor class diversity compared to now.
[1:42:53] 2morebeers: immolation great for roots xD
[1:42:53] mpresz: lol thing that bothers me about dh is look at his bar... 5 buttons on there and they insane
[1:42:54] burgundyGG: immo cleanse into druid
[1:43:00] lennetth171174: rogué is better in some cases
[1:43:14] snowfalllllll: @fovven its a cc based meta literally perma stun lock
[1:43:22] haendicap: 2x immo aura, fell barrage, cleansed by is just amazing
[1:43:24] chinchin23: @mpresz
[1:43:29] haendicap: just big brr passive dam
[1:43:35] 2morebeers: we telling pikaboo like he doesnt know this game better than all of us xD
[1:43:41] chinchin23: @mpresz what thats skill what ya mean pepega
[1:43:42] ripintides: rogue is a thinking man's demon hunter
[1:43:42] Danishlandfill: ask whaazz why he dies so much 😂
[1:43:48] chrisiirc: maybe try immo cleanse
[1:43:54] davErosEe: the other build does way less damage, is immo aura trash damage
[1:43:55] averagenjoyerrrr: @2morebeers chat just yapping KEKW

[1:44:07] FoxiekittenWoW: @2morebeers its not that he doesn´t knwo the game, but you can cleary see he doesn´t know much about dh
[1:44:08] bransby09: Yea i hate not having double im
[1:44:09] bransby09: imo

[1:45:39] Dritzzts: just got here why is lock doing 0 dmg?
[1:45:59] icedigital: I love full immo build for pve, so I'd imagine it pumps in pvp too
[1:45:59] wrinklykitten: absterge has the ugliest laugh ive ever heard
[1:46:10] joeylewistv: does pika work or just stream?
[1:46:27] chrisiirc: this is work ya

[1:47:18] Lenko77: can you share the build
[1:47:20] davErosEe: it’s definitely fake damage, it trades death sweep damage for immo aura damage
[1:47:20] fovven: build is more pad damage
[1:47:22] Phycerog: pad
[1:47:24] vilecurse_01: Love that build

[1:47:44] Cimmo: hop on the jdc
[1:47:54] burgundyGG: AOE purge goes dummy
[1:48:02] malakaidh: death sweep is what ur dmg should be and the other build enables that
[1:48:08] hawgcast: all the dh mains saying pad
[1:48:08] beastboyy122: you wanna meta before EB
[1:48:12] beastboyy122: big death seeep
