[4:23:52] andrewgape: x-y
[4:23:52] Ryso33: x-y i think like it cancels out one of the x-y
[4:23:52] jared6599: x+y was the answer
[4:23:53] hoovesers: x-y
[4:23:54] moistydank: x-y
[4:23:55] Woah_Zerk: just gotta factor fam
[4:23:55] innakilla: x-y
[4:23:55] krazybaz: @oopicklerickoo i was tryin to make him feel less dumb
[4:23:59] pekti52: I just got here, but if we're doing math, I'm out lol
[4:24:01] HouseOnFire: x + y
[4:24:04] bakeram4: 2 negs equal a positive
[4:24:06] gavtoski: (x+y)(x-y)=x^2-y^2
[4:24:06] fredwig: You can go check it
[4:24:09] fredwig: ^
[4:24:10] theohvist: The fact that we went through an entire Expansion about traveling throughout the Afterlife, and we didn't get a Necromancer Class available for us during it. It was as good a chance as getting Death Knights in WoTLK, Monks in MoP, and Demon Hunters in Legion...
[4:24:11] gavtoski: easy factor bruh
[4:24:12] atorob: I can imagine you at a testing center, "full send that one" "had to do it"
[4:24:13] downypoof: x^2 = x * x

[4:24:16] innakilla: @pekti52 lol
[4:24:16] pragma90: bro what even is x and what even is y, how can letters even be in math
[4:24:19] SammyLettuce: math is for NERDS
[4:24:24] stridtul: x^2-y^2 = (x-y)*(x+y)
[4:24:25] JesusTbyte: The answer it's always B
[4:24:27] mensah82: x+y, the x-y will cancel out when you factor
[4:24:28] stridtul: answer is x+y
[4:24:30] HotTenderloins: x + y
[4:24:33] Dritzzts: whats the discount now
