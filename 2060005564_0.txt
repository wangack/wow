[0:00:23] babaka137: hi
[0:00:47] ZallKlos: first?
[0:05:25] nemeuxs: yo mes do you use arena 123 to target?
[0:05:39] alan6778: yo wsp mes
[0:05:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: PogBones PogBones PogBones
[0:06:55] Zbrizzy: Fuseton went berserk
[0:07:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Chanimal used that extinction blast tech in the match before this last one
[0:07:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fuseton is on fire, playing so amazing
[0:07:58] tmk1t: is echo worse
[0:07:59] americanmoses18: sup messy mes
[0:08:05] tmk1t: or is the meta shifted and teams are that much better
[0:08:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: They have swapped mage for warlock 2 times
[0:08:55] Zbrizzy: The lock looked better
[0:09:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo lost both times with the arcane mage, but won with the lock
[0:09:56] tmk1t: finally a meta where mage is punished and echo struggle. coincidence? doubt it
[0:10:59] Zbrizzy: Limps is going crazy
[0:11:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH does a lot more damage than outlaw, yeah
[0:12:28] ConchubarOD: does that 5 and 10 multiply or add
[0:12:29] Zbrizzy: Fuseton has also looked really good all series
[0:12:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: That synergy is looking good for sure
[0:13:13] americanmoses18: what is going onnnn
[0:13:16] avenueone: big nuts there to live
[0:13:26] Vigi9413: lontar is a shaman god
[0:13:33] Vigi9413: not lontar sorry
[0:13:35] Vigi9413: fuseton
[0:13:37] Guettalx: what a game holy fuck
[0:13:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: That was the same thing that happened when they won with the lock before
[0:14:47] tmk1t: Mes- what's up with link? is it bugging or are teams killing it THAT fast? in your match i didnt even see it on the map before it died
[0:14:58] tmk1t: does blizz need to make it immuine for the first tick or sometihing?
[0:15:01] Vigi9413: why is this skirmish weekly the worst thing on fresh toons lol
[0:15:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: In that first  Echo win they got Merce instead of Limps, about the only difference
[0:15:36] tmk1t: gotchya
[0:16:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa, Raiku has to redeem himself, he is 0-2 so far
[0:17:16] Zbrizzy: What would be the reason for the arcane swith here?
[0:17:33] Vigi9413: didn't they just win with rogue/destro?
[0:17:35] Vigi9413: why swap
[0:17:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: The mage can do more CC I think, and more burst, but I don't really know
[0:18:39] ConchubarOD: have you played on the broadcast this awc season?
[0:18:53] ConchubarOD: or is nerfed dk just not worth it in those games
[0:19:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would have kept Chanimal in, but they are doing some kind of strategic pick in case the other team counterpicks a melee cleave, I think
[0:19:45] Vigi9413: they might be scared that chibaku has a melee cleave
[0:19:52] Daydash_Gaming: yo Mes! what did you think of the ‘the move’ upset? what did you think the other team did to whoop em so hard
[0:20:28] Vigi9413: probably just locked it in so they wouldn't lock in a melee cleave
[0:21:12] Daydash_Gaming: wonder why they didn’t try a diff comp. weird they didn’t try a better one
[0:21:12] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:21:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Merce is really good on warrior
[0:22:10] MartyrTV1: merce has a weird history
[0:22:20] MartyrTV1: warlock main on wotlk pservers until legion
[0:22:25] MartyrTV1: first rank1 in retail in bfa as warrior
[0:22:32] Vigi9413: merce may be a good warrior but idk if warrior is great atm
[0:22:32] MartyrTV1: and then goes back to lock
[0:22:41] MartyrTV1: he is a warlock main originally
[0:23:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, Echo has had one of the best rogue mage teams, they are always pretty good on it
[0:23:28] Vigi9413: but the question is if echo locked in rogue/lock would chibaku have locked in the cleave
[0:23:33] tmk1t: LMAO THAT WAS HILARIOUS
[0:24:14] Vigi9413: holy shit
[0:24:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well played Chibaku
[0:24:32] Vigi9413: they got block and said... okay we'll kill whaazz
[0:24:32] americanmoses18: rips bye echo down low
[0:24:37] tmk1t: Feels like whaaz is not respecting the enemy team at all their
[0:24:48] tmk1t: there*
[0:25:00] Seventhedeadly: Mes Lock when???
[0:25:01] MartyrTV1: @notmes can you permit me i want to give u a link u can watch while waiting for next game
[0:25:02] Vigi9413: did hoolibang get knocked out?
[0:25:08] MartyrTV1: peepoArrive
[0:25:16] Jubite: feels much more rock paper scissors than 'best team'
[0:25:27] Vigi9413: by a dc?
[0:25:31] Vigi9413: that's trash
[0:25:47] tmk1t: they were losing the game
[0:25:50] tmk1t: and the dc happened
[0:26:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I do wonder if sub is the way to go for rogue mage
[0:26:09] tmk1t: ohhh yea youre right youre right
[0:26:11] tmk1t: my b
[0:26:13] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:26:15] tmk1t: on dalaran yea
[0:26:22] Vigi9413: but they were already losing the series?
[0:26:26] MartyrTV1: Sadge
[0:26:26] Vigi9413: and you can't wait in AWC?
[0:26:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the mage is 0-3
[0:26:53] fwankey: they won 2 with lock yep
[0:27:01] Jubite: think raiku has yet to win in top 8s?
[0:27:11] Vigi9413: don't wait and it's just gg sorry about ya
[0:27:15] tmk1t: this is also part of the reason the final tournament of the season should be LAN
[0:28:07] tmk1t: right, but that final one needs to be LAN (the end-end one)
[0:28:30] Vigi9413: damn win a cup and get gauntlet
[0:28:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those pirates tho, arrrrrgh
[0:29:36] Vigi9413: i think lava lava takes it
[0:29:54] dawsonator171: Good morning sir.
[0:30:02] Vigi9413: he went afk daws
[0:30:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would think Lava Lava is the favorite in this matchup
[0:30:08] theodeth: what was the cleave comp that echo was afraid of?
[0:30:17] Vigi9413: i think any cleave
[0:30:26] Vigi9413: rogue/mage handles cleave better
[0:30:28] dawsonator171: my good morning still stands vigi.
[0:30:48] Vigi9413: sorry i played uno reverse cause it's 2pm Kappa
[0:30:48] theodeth: outlaw destro dies to cleaves?
[0:31:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Chan with the extinction blast
[0:31:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: That freaking Mythic+ staff seems to still hit hard even being nerfed
[0:32:25] dawsonator171: @Vigi9413 technically when I said it to him it was 11:58 am his time.
[0:32:27] dawsonator171: KEKW
[0:33:34] tmk1t: @theodeth if you lose the first match yes b/c of small maps

[0:40:03] sunileif: i called it
[0:40:22] Xcyyted: healer doing most dmg for kill xD
[0:40:45] Vigi9413: @notmes you had a raid while you were gone
[0:41:26] shiefen: @notmes have u guys thought of running pres vs some match ups instead of rshams feel like the pres got more burst potential, but maybe not worth the trade off
[0:41:26] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:41:54] addyz0r: echo vs chibaku was insaane. best game this year imo
[0:42:15] tmk1t: Ziqo is unreal at casting, especially since he doesn't play retail hardly at all anymore
[0:42:18] tmk1t: guy is such a natural
[0:42:40] ConchubarOD: The lack of a need to be "PC" in your analysis is nice about the watchparty.
[0:43:11] ConchubarOD: I don't mean not swearing
[0:43:13] Vigi9413: you are
[0:43:36] avenueone: !ave
[0:43:36] Nightbot: fuck u ave
[0:43:38] avenueone: hopefully
[0:43:38] sunileif: swear more
[0:43:39] Vigi9413: i heard the Fuck word the other day... my little ears
[0:43:42] ConchubarOD: I just mean in terms of not having to keep hyping up the matchup for the sake of the broadcast, if that makes sense?
[0:43:43] sunileif: fuck u aave
[0:43:45] Kikrino: Mes is a very nice and chilled out person
[0:43:47] dawsonator171: !ave

[0:44:20] Vigi9413: turns out their just gonna trade one shots
[0:44:44] Vigi9413: i can't resolve the prediction in normal twitch D:
[0:45:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ouch
[0:45:17] sunileif: fucking comedy
[0:45:43] Vigi9413: the predicition window wasn't over yet sorry
[0:46:13] Blaze150000: niksi is also long time around on awc right ?
[0:46:19] Vigi9413: bro that's a 126k earth shock
[0:46:20] Vigi9413: wtf
[0:46:23] dawsonator171: I don't think dream breath or recursion was on corkiey.
[0:46:38] dawsonator171: he died in 2
[0:46:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH ele is a very strong comp, we saw it quite a few times in EU action recently
[0:46:40] dawsonator171: nvm
[0:47:19] Vigi9413: they're trying to play liquids comp and realizing the struggle for sam lmao
[0:47:47] Vigi9413: did they delete aug evoker from the game?
[0:48:15] dawsonator171: I'm not okay with it mes.
[0:48:17] Vigi9413: wait it crazy in arena
[0:48:51] dawsonator171: it ruins some of my 1 shot theory crafting.
[0:48:55] dawsonator171: sure.
[0:49:02] dawsonator171: i have teh headset on this time.
[0:49:09] Vigi9413: dude
[0:49:11] Vigi9413: what is happening
[0:49:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ouch boomy
[0:49:30] sunileif: nerf rogues
[0:49:34] sunileif: then dh
[0:49:40] tmk1t: is dh-rogue viable?
[0:49:44] Vigi9413: what makes coffey so insane though compared to other dh
[0:49:48] Blaze150000: yeah dh is too strong lets nerf dk
[0:49:49] tmk1t: feels like thats a good answer
[0:50:46] stone12033: commune would have gotten cloned too they were screwed
[0:50:49] dawsonator171: corkiy is only playing 2 set and insane vers
[0:50:53] dawsonator171: I don't understand.
[0:50:55] Jubite: feels like their damage is just S++ compared to other classes
[0:51:02] diosilvl: commune is kinda dumb no? if no lifebind it might go on rog
[0:51:16] Vigi9413: i feel like that math doesn't math
[0:51:34] Vigi9413: ah it does math
[0:51:35] Jubite: no heals on the boomie for 12seconds besides an echo and rewind
[0:51:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: resto shaman seems like the way to go this season, true
[0:51:41] Vigi9413: the felblade didn't show
[0:51:46] diosilvl: oh, I thought u were advocating against it, mb
[0:51:54] Jubite: go back to the last death window
[0:52:02] ConchubarOD: they zoomed in I think, there was more
[0:52:15] Syndrose10: VoHiYo
[0:52:28] Vigi9413: if you don't heal... they will die
[0:52:31] shiefen: boomie had 2 dream breath hots on him
[0:52:36] Jubite: not blaming, but just hard to live anything with that little incoming healas
[0:52:36] shiefen: you could see it in the game replay
[0:53:06] dawsonator171: corkiy playing nearly max vers, and for some reason clyde playing M+ staff
[0:53:36] dawsonator171: you don't trade stat for the use?
[0:53:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: off global is a little crazy
[0:54:20] dawsonator171: my bad, expected budgeting loss.
[0:55:44] Jubite: the damage is nutty
[0:56:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH is fine
[0:56:19] stone12033: better not queue boomy today
[0:56:25] Vigi9413: lava lava just won... and it was insane
[0:56:41] diosilvl: "offensive global" =/= full casted empowered spell
[0:56:53] diosilvl: still insane, yeah
[0:56:58] sunileif: skill issue
[0:57:06] ConchubarOD: ye it does some healing
[0:57:17] sunileif: ok broken dh issue
[0:57:19] Jubite: boomkin stocks plummeting
[0:57:38] Datguyjay: 2 100k earth stocks + dh damage
[0:57:49] dawsonator171: it's not even a bad choice global in the moment. Boomkin created all kinds of distance there.
[0:57:50] Vigi9413: you get points for winning in lower bracket?
[0:57:53] sunileif: nerf dh NODDERS
[0:58:03] stone12033: does anyone in NA have that comp?
[0:58:17] stone12033: the dh ele
[0:58:22] Jubite: 92% hp at 5.5seconds before death lolol
[0:58:30] sunileif: mes does dh ele
[0:58:33] Vigi9413: i feel the dh ele would play differently in NA
[0:58:38] sunileif: he's ral good at it
[0:58:44] llamllap: wonder why echo really wanted to have raiku play. with chanimal they won 2
[0:58:44] Muz1k: Time dilation did all the damage
[0:58:59] Muz1k: Did 6 65k ticks
[0:59:03] Vigi9413: rogue mage i think plays better against cleave
[0:59:09] NightMunchies: sup mes..look at the names  des guzz coffee.des guzzles coffee =they win
[0:59:17] buffevoker: Yo mes hows it hanging
[0:59:31] shiefen: I wonder if chibaku will blind pick it in the final (predicting echo will blind chan)
[0:59:33] dawsonator171: does swapxy make the gauntlet at least? haven't followed what team he is on now.
[1:00:02] buffevoker: Swapxy is in round 1
[1:00:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: the gauntlets are going to be awesome to watch, so hardcore
[1:00:10] buffevoker: Which is insane
[1:00:51] Loadedmvp: is black still free win with no healer rooster or ?
[1:01:12] stone12033: what happene to their healer
[1:01:25] stone12033: did he say a bad word
[1:01:42] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:03:23] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:03:55] sunileif: echo 3rd
[1:04:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo will go with chanimal against DH ele
[1:04:22] Twerksrus: @howtobasicmd love how they care so much about classic gold for gear, but that’s 90% of retail
[1:04:38] Jubite: think lontar was playing fine, but looked like he was chasing raiku 99% of the time
[1:04:46] sunileif: mes is backing echo everyone vote echo
[1:04:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: The mage is 0-3 today yeah it's going to be rough for Echo to be confident picking it again
[1:05:10] tmk1t: putting Lontar on druid is troll AF
[1:05:13] tmk1t: against the enemy comp
[1:05:39] tmk1t: in ruins definitely
[1:05:43] NightMunchies: sub is good
[1:05:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think sub may be better than outlaw in rogue mage, currently
[1:05:49] sunileif: mes endorsing echo vote for echo now!
[1:05:57] Jubite: i think whaaz has been on the anti sub train on stream for a while
[1:06:08] sunileif: echo favourited by mes vote echo
[1:06:48] NightMunchies: not really its the player not the spec
[1:06:53] sunileif: comon im saving up for a super bag on klink
[1:07:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Send it!
[1:07:42] stone12033: they can delete guzz
[1:07:46] NightMunchies: sub gonna wreck
[1:07:56] stone12033: true
[1:08:12] Loadedmvp: will we see Raiku to get off that 0% winrate ? LUL
[1:08:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah sub still has their tricks just less damage than they used to
[1:08:25] mayfire15: I wonder if sub is just better into any team that doesn’t have a outlaw rogue
[1:09:09] Vigi9413: lava lava is gonna pop off
[1:09:31] NightMunchies: lol
[1:09:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: That's the shake and bake
[1:09:38] stone12033: bye channel points SeriousSloth
[1:09:44] NightMunchies: se sub wrecks
[1:09:53] addyz0r: all rogue specs are top viable imo.
[1:09:57] Vigi9413: sub still wrecks…. need dk
[1:09:58] addyz0r: no dk spec
[1:10:07] Vigi9413: nerf*
[1:10:17] NightMunchies: whaazz hero
[1:10:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah this comp did wreck a lot of arcane mages
[1:10:44] Cynasist: hey @notmes qnd chat how are the matches going today
[1:10:48] SuperSunBros64: did echo win?
[1:10:50] addyz0r: think dex is playing daanny low vers?
[1:10:56] Datguyjay: can't kill the mage if you can't play the game *taps forehead
[1:11:01] NightMunchies: deleted EM
[1:11:10] NightMunchies: yup echo won
[1:11:21] SuperSunBros64: nice
[1:11:38] addyz0r: danny is loco
[1:11:53] addyz0r: it's cool
[1:11:57] addyz0r: but scary
[1:12:03] Glorioushero: Who is Danny?
[1:12:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: 130K evis
[1:12:13] Vigi9413: I need to see a lava lava chibaku final
[1:12:19] Vigi9413: sorry echo
[1:12:58] addyz0r: @Glorioushero NA druid healer who is insanely good and plays low verse on ladder
[1:12:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dannycarry is a pretty awesome rdruid that makes it work with low vers gearing
[1:13:34] Glorioushero: @addyz0r Ah, thanks. Old WoW player here, but EU only... So... :3
[1:13:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rat stayed on sub and we saw their thug cleave do some big things
[1:13:54] addyz0r: i'm eu but watch NA mostly
[1:14:01] NightMunchies: vers =awesome  druids stack that
[1:14:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: And Howton was on sub with Hoolibang but yeah almost all the rogues went outlaw and said sub was dead
[1:14:44] NightMunchies: sub's not dead by far lol
[1:17:03] addyz0r: hahah
[1:17:04] NightMunchies: ouch

[1:27:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: That arcane burst
[1:27:34] PSHllllT: the thing is if war is on lock and dh is on lontar, nobody will interrupt the sheep on dh and lontar can follow easily with a cyclone
[1:27:56] PSHllllT: so lontar is much more safe than Dev
[1:28:08] PSHllllT: dex*
[1:28:24] NightMunchies: not sure what to think  but i see echo winning
[1:28:26] Vigi9413: what did echo lock in

[1:28:56] PSHllllT: who do you train as lava ?
[1:29:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo does have a chance, but they can't make any big mistakes
[1:29:13] Vigi9413: we've seen lava lava can kill anyone quickly so
[1:29:13] PSHllllT: mage all day i guess
[1:29:29] NightMunchies: yeah they tried war and heals ate some dirt
[1:29:47] Vigi9413: it sucks if lava loses though they're so explosive
[1:30:11] PSHllllT: dh is GIGA broken on sewers
