[2:11:14] Rontii: Yeahh like 3-4y ago, but getting new love for the game <3
[2:11:22] JattixTV: pick up your weapon
[2:11:51] JohnC_82: to your right
[2:11:55] itsashleyvibes: i feel like being completely overgeared with 4set in a +2 isnt a good metric to see if its good dps ^^;

[2:12:56] Rontii: I used to have this crit destro lock in MoP and WoD and it was so good in dungeons with the right setup
[2:13:07] Grouwdi: they getting rid of DBM usage in the game ?????? SURE HOPE SO
[2:13:21] Rontii: Then I was forced to go affli-demo lock for mythic raids xd

[2:13:57] Rontii: Who misses the legendary ring burst window? :D
[2:14:00] NovaNax: DBM is good yes but it kinda Destroys the Purpose of Learning mechanics :3 Why I love ffxiv raiding which has zero addons
[2:14:08] Grouwdi: 16 years I never needed DBM, game is not that complex for its usage
[2:14:21] Grouwdi: @remokizz YES! 10000% .
[2:15:05] selecy: soo many crits
[2:15:07] Rontii: Not really remo, it only helps with remembering when is what mechanic. Mythic raids would be so annoying since the bosses have different phases and 20 abilities xd
[2:15:11] Pantteranova: Yo @Swifty glad to hear that Sasha let you keep the closet lol
[2:15:47] Grouwdi: @Rontii but the boss/raid mechanics already tell you this - it's how players like myself and him learned to do boss fights without the addon
[2:16:16] NovaNax: Tho i think Swifty would die to much without dbm
[2:16:23] Rontii: @grouwdi Yeahh it's fun to play without, but for some people it's annoying without
[2:16:37] Rontii: Haha yeahh xd
[2:16:40] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[2:16:44] NovaNax: Na make Normal ez
[2:16:45] Grouwdi: and he just said what I've said for over a decade: it's not needed - straight from Ion Hazzikostas
[2:16:59] Zurqal: the actual issue is, wow is less a skill-based game/MMO, and just a chess-style "learn the moves"... Until Ion makes Wow a TBC-style game again, this issue will persist
[2:17:02] NovaNax: and make heroic/mythic harder
[2:17:08] lunatik710: people dont want easy
[2:17:12] Grouwdi: I just want the game to be complex again - that's what I miss about WoW
[2:17:23] Rontii: @grouwdi It's not mandatory, it's appreciated for people who don't have time to learn it all or just don't want to
[2:17:40] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:18:32] Zurqal: every single mythic encounter in shadow has exactly ONE way to deal w it, and it's been this way since almost all the way back to pandaland

[2:18:44] Rontii: @grouwdi I know lots of people who absolutely only gain from it, no negative effect. If we don't want to use it doesn't matter :D Some people just need it
[2:19:07] JattixTV: @Swifty I agree with you to an extent. FF14 has done a great job with endgame raiding. It is challenging but without all these complex annoying mechanics. I would love to see WoW be able to learn and implement the same kinda design for their raids
[2:19:20] Grouwdi: @Rontii if you play FFXIV you'll find it's well designed yet extremly difficult (on Savage Mode) and no addons in the game and people just learn. I think people just learn the easy way when there was already an easy way - but takes more time to learn. Those in my guild that don't use addons see those with addons making too many mistakes - not cause they're bad, just they rely on the addon instead of what's going on in the raid/screen/boss ect
[2:19:32] aldabal22: swifty
[2:19:58] Rastafaris: swifty you know what WoW really needs damage done tracker like recount just implemented in WoW
[2:20:04] 7thSaga: i think be nice if thay removed addons
[2:20:25] Rontii: @grouwdi That's true, relying totally on addons is stupid :D Haven't gotten to FFXIV endgame yet :d Playing Lost Ark currently
[2:20:50] Rastafaris: i use out of all add ons only 3 tbh dbm,recount and bagnon
[2:21:03] Grouwdi: @Rontii you will LOVE IT! <3 :)
[2:21:15] Zurqal: @Grouwdi you're making the classic mistake, Wow is a mouse-clicker, and FF (esp fourteen) is an actual MMO. Go play the Burning crusade Vashj or 25-man Lich King raids, there is NOTHING like those in shadow
[2:22:00] williwhite94: VERY EASY
[2:22:33] Rastafaris: i cant recall WoD it was long time ago
[2:22:45] Rontii: @grouwdi I bet! FFX was the first game I bought with my own money :D Totally want to start raiding in FFXIV, saving money for a better pc atm. Playing on a 6 year old gaming laptop now xd
[2:22:48] iamdookie: i agree
[2:22:50] MoonChocolates: I AGREE
[2:23:12] Grouwdi: @Zurqal Yep I've played since 2005 (year after release) up to Shadowlands - Old Content and Today's Mythic Raids - not once needed those addons - all mechanics from the boss and room the boss is in gives you all the information already. Tons of us today refuse to use those addons - and I'm not an "elitist" please don't think that. I learned boss fights without addons by learning by the develoeprs design. That's all.

[2:24:14] Pantteranova: @Grouwdi No one cares.
[2:24:22] Rastafaris: yea but swifty theres people who post stuff from beta or test server stuff cuz blizzard wont do NDA
[2:24:44] Zurqal: @Grouwdi never said you were elitist, I used Droodfocus and then MSBT when it first came out, and if thosse had not come out, I think pvp and high-end encounters would have been too much for me
[2:24:50] Grouwdi: @pantteranova Please do Not be rude here, that is uncalled for...
[2:24:55] Folloutboy: Hey Swifty what was your favourite expansion ?

[3:48:16] apocalipsothechosen: but its a 3min cd
[3:48:25] Luky685: orc is the best overall just because of the stun resist is passive all the time

[3:48:41] Zanny7: @Swifty It depends on wether the regen is coded to be interrupted by taking damage or being subject of incoming damage
[3:48:54] apocalipsothechosen: bro if swifty is unholy he bursts every min, and any decent player will stun him on that 1min
[3:49:00] Cowardpatty: Well to each their own, but I'm Zanda Troll on my DK, and I find their racials way more useful than Orc

[4:05:08] Cowardpatty: Probably don't need Death Coil on bars
[4:05:25] Cowardpatty: As frost
[4:05:36] Cowardpatty: Unholy uses Death Coil
[4:05:45] Ruxthas: coil is unholy ability
[4:05:48] lldeathlordll: @Swifty swifty breath is not viable  because pretty sure ppl will kite or CC you and your breath will ran out, most or i could say all ppl go two handed obliteration build, two handed because from your passive when you use two handed use weapon your obliterate damage will be buffed
[4:05:55] Rontii: swiftyPcool

[6:55:11] Projnz: For pure stat value I think head is best legendary choice, atleast for PvE if you have 4set without helmet
[6:55:19] WheelieWatt: neck wrist belt rings
[6:55:29] Epicurtious: 291 legendary ring has a socket
[6:55:29] bi0x182: neck wrist rings get sockets
[6:55:39] Projnz: @PappaKappaa You can get a socket on a wrist drop yes, but legendary crafted does not have socket
[6:55:39] bi0x182: and belt true
[6:56:10] PappaKappaa: @Projnz That's what I mean tho, I did get socket on my crafted legendary wrist
[6:56:23] WheelieWatt: if your are trying to stat 1 stat see what conquest pieces you can buy. with crit

[7:05:09] PappaKappaa: @Smoothvodka007 You can still craft a 291 legendary but from the campaign your ccovenant specific legendary will be on belt at 262, unsure if you can upgrade it without unity
[7:05:09] PapaBeks: helms, necks, bracers, belts or tings of ephemera infused mesh
