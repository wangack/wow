[0:44:04] stabzmcgeee: @Red_Dead_Redeem im so glad im not the only one thats asks a question in twitch chat that i could have just googled
[0:44:05] warrenny: @gamerkillance When does it become artificial? Raid lockout? sub? Testing time between patches? Ability cooldown?
[0:44:27] Red_Dead_Redeem: the cap for valor was what? 6k and some weekly?
[0:44:44] warrenny: @stabzmcgeee We’ve all done it at one point our another
[0:44:53] GamerKillance: This late into the tier why stop people from gearing with artificial time gating with caps? I get evening it out when tier is relevent, but all the races are done
[0:45:00] GamerKillance: A lot of people already have their gear
[0:45:03] warrenny: @red_dead_redeem 750 weekly plus a base cap
[0:45:15] GamerKillance: So let them gear up fast now. pointless to hold people back
[0:45:19] Red_Dead_Redeem: oh hell nooo

[6:15:30] smashwow: also towelliee if you're looking to do damage you're also running sleeper lego too. so between all that you pump
[6:15:51] Sadisticmedic: Just blame the Ret Pally LOL
[6:15:55] DragonofWolves: So AMD just announced their 6000 series apparantly
[6:15:57] Keyastaron_: timed a 16 mists w 4 mages a priest and a DH tank ( me ) and we only had ONE guessing game.. how is that possible
[6:17:08] smashwow: @keyastaron_ how'd you get 6 people in the Dungeon?
[6:17:23] Kisswani: @keyastaron_ you got one extra person , that's a lot of DPS Kappa
[6:17:23] 91Niki: @keyastaron_ 4 dps?! 1 heal and 1 tank sacHMM What sort of cheats you running
[6:17:25] Keyastaron_: sorry it was 3 mages @smashwow
[6:17:29] TheCliffyShow: It really wants you to have that battery.
[6:17:30] pickle_niik: is valor uncapped now? !title?
[6:17:31] Keyastaron_: LUL
[6:17:49] Keyastaron_: yes @HAmynamesNik
[6:17:56] pickle_niik: cool ty
[6:18:14] 91Niki: Wait, you have a title? Kappa
[6:18:19] tetrahydridodinitrogen: !valor

[6:18:32] bonkszn: @Towelliee can we see ur talents for a sec mr. towelliee
[6:18:33] Kisswani: FeelsEUMan
[6:18:34] mavros_kyrios: Towelliee, will you be updating UI to replace dead mods? latest is 2020 on Wowinterface
[6:18:35] dutchie76: Phase 5 is live for TBC
[6:18:37] TheCliffyShow: There's so obviously a secret message in there.
[6:19:08] duffluv22: Calm down chat shills
[6:19:11] mavros_kyrios: okay
[6:19:22] Keyastaron_: @dutchie76  i havent played TBC all i did was boost a lvl 55 warrior.... when wrath comes out ima play that
[6:19:33] dutchie76: @keyastaron_ SeemsGood
[6:19:34] 91Niki: @Towelliee People don't read the title. Unless!! It says "I have Alpha keys" then people read titles LUL
[6:19:47] raldrik: How did the vault go today?
[6:20:06] 91Niki: "HOW DO I WIN A KEY STREAMER??? sacTIMMY "
[6:20:13] smashwow: ion would say the 278 thing is gear @Towelliee i don't see that one passing the Account Wide test.
[6:20:21] Keyastaron_: RIGHT @Towelliee  i want the 278 conduits to be ACCOUNT BOUND its the end of the expac LET US HAVE POWER Kappa but making our own tier sets is power enough
[6:20:28] Everbliss: @Towelliee do you think in Blizzards new philosophy, something like the 9.2 cypher unlocks would be account-wide (like I feel it should be)
[6:20:31] Mecabeast: the cloak was massive on your one toon
[6:20:32] MinivannGaming: !ALPHA DF
[6:20:32] Moobot: @MinivannGaming WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/encrypted-10-0-dragonflight-build-now-on-wowdev-server-326816 || Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[6:20:45] smashwow: the rep should be
[6:20:47] smashwow: for sure
[6:21:07] mrsuflakis: we need 278 gear catch up
[6:21:15] warrenny: Rep should be
[6:21:20] warrenny: Hopefully in db
[6:21:25] warrenny: Df
[6:21:26] mmrghost7: hell no u must suffer on ur alts thats how blizzard likes it
[6:21:38] Jewishraver: how is it "gear" when you get condus for non spec?
[6:21:41] Kisswani: wait what ?
[6:21:49] Kisswani: really ?
[6:22:08] Kisswani: that would be great
[6:22:14] ShaunsterTheMonster: Yup
[6:22:26] smashwow: we need 278 catchup gear? that ilvl is the 9.2 ilvl.
[6:22:32] Kisswani: It would motivate me to level the rest of my alts if that's the case
[6:22:50] icerasta: im pretty sure it is 252 ilvl
[6:23:01] Kisswani: it's 252 now
[6:23:07] zeitgeiz: Really wish the console was account wide
[6:23:09] darssia_: That console and the torgast powers should be account wide. No reason not to be.
[6:23:38] thatguynamedjans: im not seeing anything on the cypher stuff, but I see M0s will drop 262 gear
[6:23:39] Nehcrom: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:23:39] smashwow: nah max ilvl for 9.2 is 278. if you're talking relic gear. yes 252 is the cap. but it's not mythic raiding or M+ 15s
[6:23:39] Kisswani: @annassae or like a 90% discount on the cost or something
[6:23:41] ironfist625: Wish blizzard would just make everything alt friendly. I really don’t want to grind enlightened rep again especially when dailies don’t even give rep

[6:25:09] ClayMatioNation: I've heard it said both ways. Both are acceptable imo LUL
[6:25:32] Kisswani: KEKW
[6:25:47] TheCliffyShow: I wish they didn't get rid of familiar catching in 2.

[6:30:02] ClayMatioNation: Have a blessed day dude!
[6:30:02] darssia_: no alpha or beta means buggy and unbalanced game.
