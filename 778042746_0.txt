[1:01:03] Orbrak: just wait for the first live dmcs from music played in a midroll ad
[1:01:03] aeg5000: There was a tweet from wow u can play their ingame music i do believe
[1:01:04] Eshel: Shakespeare said it best - “first, kill all the lawyers” lol
[1:01:04] Ortinoth: Some of amazon music can be dmca as well
[1:01:11] JLFord78: I'm sorry, but this has gone too fucking far....seriously, if anyone can get access to the song without bypassing a paywall (i.e. you can watch it on YouTube without paying anything) then I think it should be treated like the whole expectation of privacy thing....
[1:01:14] XshadowturkeyX: sha is still here
[1:01:15] dutchie76: really ort
[1:01:29] KingsandClubs: @jlford78 absoluetly
[1:01:35] dutchie76: Napster all over again LUL
[1:01:35] Gnerdyy: Fuck man. I guess it's serious.
[1:01:38] TrowGundam: It's everyone. Unless you just started, you dont' really have a choice. It is delete or risk your livelihood
[1:01:41] JLFord78: Basically, if you do something in public, you have no expectation of privacy. If you post your fucking music in a public forum, then it's fair game, imho
[1:01:46] NewWorldReign: What does this mean for Spofity etc users who put on music on their streams?
[1:01:47] Otschboh: @Towelliee Playing with their livelyhood because of fucking music ...
[1:01:53] stormpetal: Preach has deleted some stuff he tweeted
[1:02:04] Ortinoth: @dutchie76 DMCA can be any music that you do not own the rights too
[1:02:08] Eshel: Somebody played a Metallica song and Lars got his panties in a bunch again? Lmao
[1:02:15] TrowGundam: @JLFord78 Well copyright law doesn't agree unfortunately. It is a broken system
[1:02:20] dutchie76: ah i see
[1:02:20] Valearleen: You can’t play Spotify on stream it was on TOS before this
[1:02:29] thedr8993: Time to get our congress people to write legislation to allow fair use! FUCK DMCA
[1:02:38] dutchie76: Napster
[1:02:41] Benjhof1337: yeah many streamers that i follow mentioned via twitter/inst/..etc that they do what you mentioned ( upload to youtube etc. ) :(
[1:02:41] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Pandora
[1:02:42] KingsandClubs: @thedr8993 good luck hahaha
[1:02:42] NewWorldReign: limewire?
[1:02:43] oraclespyro: pandora
[1:02:43] Otschboh: Pandora
[1:02:43] furly707: PANDORA
[1:02:43] fartmancer69: pandora
[1:02:46] dutchie76: Limewire
[1:02:47] ViveusOG: pandora
[1:02:48] dutchie76: LUL
[1:02:52] Dixietwist: so the wow soundtracks you were listing to before can you still use those

[1:02:53] cedar003: pandora
[1:02:53] Danrip: Myspace Music
[1:02:59] Avinar: time to pre-record me on a xylophone for my streams. I'll make my own covers. Kappa

[1:03:03] ViveusOG: DansGame
[1:03:03] XshadowturkeyX: tbh i just want everyone to play music like i want everyoen to do it in a week, they cant ban everyowen they will lose money
[1:03:05] TrowGundam: However, DMCA doesn't just apply to music. Game developers can submit takedowns for their games. That is why this is such a really bad situation.
[1:03:34] dutchie76: oooof
[1:03:35] Ortinoth: @TrowGundam true but normally game dev's wont do that
[1:03:41] HairyAreolaus: Beginning of the end for Twitch, they're not the only show in town.
[1:03:50] TrowGundam: @Ortinoth Luckily, but it has happened, so there is precedent.
[1:03:52] EarlofCockwood: @Towelliee Do you think a SL release end of november still realistic?
[1:03:55] reesedubz: Everyone really needs to put their vods on youtube
[1:03:56] Gnerdyy: Only just started streaming and I know I should do it.
[1:03:57] Kisswani: @HairyAreolaus they kinda are
[1:04:01] valv00: spotify etc is for personal consumption not for broadcasting
[1:04:02] Excesspace: stay safe... just mute all the music
[1:04:06] sharie: monkaS
[1:04:07] KingsandClubs: The issue is that they should of think about this 10 years ago but those are old farts that lick asses with politician to get new policies and bigger they pockets
[1:04:13] HairyAreolaus: @Kisswani Nah
[1:04:17] stigzqt: stigzqt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:04:17] Moobot: Thanks for subbing for 8 months, @STIGZQT towHAMUP
[1:04:26] oraclespyro: @Towelliee can twitch go to this companys and help yall that way ?
[1:04:56] Sakshi117: How does that effect rhythm games like Osu!? @Towelliee
[1:05:05] dutchie76: whoa
[1:05:13] Kromede: PepeWhy
[1:05:16] Ortinoth: @oraclehuntar its the record companies that is doing the DMCA's since they own the rights, and your profiting from it without paying royalties to the record companies
[1:05:20] dutchie76: it is
[1:05:22] Eshel: So ... in theory ... somebody drives by your house with their music blaring ..... you’re shutdown
[1:05:22] TrowGundam: @oraclehuntar Why would they? Amazon is evidently unhappy with the profit Twitch has brought, as evident by the recent Ad changes. Why would they spend more money on it?
[1:05:27] EveryNameTakenWTF: wait so is this the end of react andys?
[1:05:29] sharie: so we cant ever do a dance of playing Scooter PepeHands again
[1:05:30] KingsandClubs: Yeah like what about OSU LUL
[1:05:34] Colt_Engineer: I AM THE LAW!!!
[1:05:37] djdavecee: what will happen should i want to stream a DJ set now then? i've been deleting vods, and a really small streamer, am i basically risking losing my channel going live?
[1:05:51] JLFord78: I work for a local ISP and yeah....it's fucking stupid
[1:05:54] kirtyalex: wow music is amazing so...
[1:05:55] Chris_127: so dumb lol
[1:05:56] Ortinoth: @oraclehuntar some of the licensing cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for 1 or 2 songs
[1:05:59] sharie: better have a soundproof room KEKW
[1:06:06] Sakshi117: so rhythm games = u cant stream dat shyt. for the most part anyways?
[1:06:10] npc9995: I wonder if Justin saw this coming and why he sold twitch to amazon. 200IQ
[1:06:10] BlindFaithFuel: Or, just chatting in a car with radio on
[1:06:10] Sandisy: you got a guest on stream and their phone signal is some song, rip. it's just so strict
[1:06:17] TrowGundam: Technically the law only requires them to notify you to remove the offending content, taht way you can fight it. However after a period of time they are forced to comply, so instead of putting a system in place to fight it they just take it down to cover their ass.
[1:06:18] Omegacloud: you know whats funny, i saw irl streamers freaking out when people around them blasted Music. They are so handycapped with a phone to react fast its just insanly stupid
[1:06:19] Sicss: the law is the law fam!
[1:06:20] Noshpan: Twitch is supposed to inform what caused the DMCA strike (as according to DMCA law), but they're not going to do so.
[1:06:23] mikejames01: no more beatsaber games
[1:06:29] HairyAreolaus: Well, get ready to bow to the masses.
[1:06:32] board4life65: class action lawsuits twitch community vs record labels?
[1:06:33] fartmancer69: dang towelliee making a cuck shed like quin? LUL
[1:06:45] saltypagrand: hello towellie

[1:07:03] Ortinoth: Best thing to do now in the game - mute In game music - easy way to be safe
[1:07:05] KingsandClubs: GTA spend like 8 millions on music

[1:07:22] Otschboh: @Towelliee Music that is made specifically for the game its save.
[1:07:22] othraerir: that would be up to rockstar and their licencing?
[1:07:26] NewWorldReign: What about that Twitch Sings thing, is that a DMCA thing?

[1:08:01] Burmarck: Sock on head?
[1:08:01] Avinar: was sock on head saved?
[1:08:02] TrowGundam: @Kelmor The thing is, Spotify doesn't have that right. Twitch would have to work with the record companies directly to get some sort of license
[1:08:06] NuAera: A plugin with Spotify would be cool, so people could join in and listen if they are a subscriber or something

[1:09:18] Avinar: montage video?
[1:09:19] TrowGundam: @Kelmor It does matter to copyright law. Spotify has the right to broadcast, but they don't have the rights to license others to broadcast, which is what is necessary.
[1:09:20] dutchie76: LUL
[1:09:20] nitemare34godd: I'm sad
[1:09:27] Fortune90: Havnt streamed in 2 years, just looked at my VoD. They deleted alll of them
[1:09:30] MissFlux: Make a copy
[1:09:35] Colly_UK: then you may want a second one lol
[1:09:35] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Huh, legends always seem bigger in your head
[1:09:39] Wiggly_Mew: @lisla everyone who streams got that email
[1:09:40] ReinholdtRanger: make a copy of the copy
[1:09:40] Smashbrother: Make a copy!
[1:09:40] KingsandClubs: You should make a copy of it
[1:09:43] OzRogue: sync that shit to s3 bro!.. then push into glacier
[1:09:43] L00deFame: lets not go this far
[1:09:47] Colly_UK: harddrive notoriously shite
[1:09:50] Sandisy: I'd buy another disk and make a clone of that one tbh. Disks do randomly fail even when not in use

[1:10:05] Eshel: As security - you should make at least one other copy and store offsite
[1:10:10] Kelmor: @TrowGundam With the added bonus of the user being able to play whatever they want, including the casters playlist
[1:10:11] 1nimicus: I honestly prefer when streamers don't have music as it seems a lazy way to not interact with viewers, also I can then listen to my own music
[1:10:14] 1n53r7c01n: @archiux not everyone
[1:10:31] Cybersqu: You can store it on AWS S3 for cents

[1:11:28] severide: damn bro :(
[1:11:33] reesedubz: Thats more than 10 years of streaming every day
[1:11:34] funKShun: Actually, some of the streamers listened to music that I didn't like and that made me not watch the stream although I liked the streamer
[1:11:35] NewWorldReign: This would cost Twitch a shit ton of money, these DMCA's will kill off the sit e and put more people in other stream sites.
[1:11:38] Kraour: Just out of curiosity did the key giveaway already happen
[1:11:42] XshadowturkeyX: yes

[1:12:30] mmrghost7: why did u have to delete ?

[1:12:55] funKShun: I don't even watch vods LUL

[1:13:04] KingsandClubs: Saving data today on physical items is so risky there needs to be something in the future that can keep that safe
[1:13:09] Necorian: Whats a VOD? ;)

[1:13:32] XshadowturkeyX: they are too worried they will lose money from streamers playing muisc, tbh ive found over 500+ songs from twitch in the past 8 years sucks to them i wont find new music to get them views on youtube now LUL
[1:13:38] TrowGundam: Their gonna tell you you are SOL and should ahve known better. They aren't gonna spend a dime to put some system in place to help. Amazon ain't gonna spend money on something like taht when it is easier to just punish the streamers
[1:13:54] Kelmor: @TrowGundam I'm not saying broadcast, i'm saying updated playlist and Spotifys own player.. I don't know about you, but I like to view some streamers, yet hate their music. This would be better all around.
[1:14:13] funKShun: I don't get this shit, isn't that free promotion of the music??
[1:14:26] mikejames01: am not downloading that NOPE
[1:14:28] Otschboh: Yeah naaa Kappa
[1:14:30] Ortinoth: @funKShun they do not see it as that -

[1:14:42] dutchie76: wth
[1:14:57] madhatterui: but my purple twitch colors
[1:15:03] TrowGundam: Except I ain't touch Overwolf stuff, their software has been so notorious in the past, I'm not putting that borderline malware on my system
[1:15:04] OzRogue: hrmmm what an original design
[1:15:09] NewWorldReign: I thought Curse merged with Twitch?
[1:15:10] Endurense: Do you have a link @Towelliee ?
[1:15:16] Kelmor: @TrowGundam also, the music as a 2nd stream, could have it's own volume levels
[1:15:19] TrowGundam: @NewWorldReign Twitch sold them
[1:15:19] Avinar: [Update all] *sub to be able to download all* Kappa
[1:15:28] Otschboh: Honestly if the api goes down i would download mods manually again.
[1:15:32] TheUnknowing: as long as its not like the old curse app where you had to pay to update more than 2 addons at a time
[1:15:34] Colly_UK: Hmmm sseems almost too good to be true
[1:15:35] mikejames01: IF they ge the money I am all for it

[1:16:03] Necorian: @Towelliee how is your start bar red?
[1:16:25] TrowGundam: I can't trust OVerwolf. Not with their history. Their software has been so bad in the past. Not making that mistake again
[1:16:30] MissFlux: @Necorian You can change them in Windows. Just search for color or something.
[1:16:35] Chris_127: is the twitch app not gunna be the way to do it anymore?
[1:17:08] TrowGundam: The section in the Twitch app for addons will be removed

[1:17:55] ChrisVelander: Hey @Towelliee , what do you think of the ingame store xmog?

[1:18:20] TrowGundam: I think them trying to get money to the addon authors is admirable. I jsut don't trust Overwolfs ability to make a client. I've had their software blue screen my computers in the past.

[1:21:35] Lisla: the mods I heavily use I support their patron or send money via Paypal
[1:21:36] Avinar: what do they actually get paid for being on curseforge?
[1:21:37] Wiggly_Mew: @xpapio he deleted them because of DMCA stuff happening with twitch
[1:21:39] Eshel: *sub cost
[1:21:46] TrowGundam: @xPapio No they exist, but most people are deleting htem because the record companies are being assholes
[1:21:58] Eikus11: How did they used to make money for making add ons?
[1:21:59] mal_athoth: Why is he doing legion raids?

[1:22:42] GilianoGVK: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:22:45] Kelmor: lol
[1:23:01] crowsanth: Overwolf is a big turnoff
[1:23:13] NewWorldReign: im n curseforge right now, cant find the desktop app
[1:23:14] TrowGundam: @Kelmor You won't, it will likeyl just be for removing ads and if it is like the curse of old, downloading more than like 2 addons at a time
[1:23:37] Sashawile: What happened to Videos? All past broadcasts and videos are gone?! WutFace
[1:23:37] TheUnknowing: i mean i'll definitely check out curseforge
[1:23:37] Towelliee: https://www.overwolf.com/app/Overwolf-CurseForge
[1:23:42] funKShun: Why do they need to force the overwolf app? Don't get it
[1:23:58] mikejames01: also https://curseforge.overwolf.com/
[1:24:01] xPapio: is the twitch curse collab going to be affected? do we know?
[1:24:01] brandon_tapartos: ill stick to copy and paste :D
[1:24:02] Wiggly_Mew: oversold bought curse
[1:24:04] mmrghost7: cuz they bought curseforge it's theirs now
[1:24:11] Kelmor: IF the adds are not annoying, and it doesn't run anything in the background. Why would people sub?
[1:24:17] ShackAttack009: p9kHI
[1:24:20] Bradwarden27: Can you farm tomb now, because i need some reliable gold farm
[1:24:21] Wiggly_Mew: overwolf*
[1:24:25] mikejames01: soon there will be no more addons on the twitch app
[1:24:28] Sicss: what happens to the twitch app/addons part?
[1:24:36] mikejames01: gone
[1:24:45] Limopar: Overwolf is an API, so the curseforge app is built in that API language
[1:24:48] TrowGundam: @Sicss Twitch sold Curse to Overwolf
[1:24:55] Kelmor: I see
[1:24:57] Silverbella: Wowup doesn't allow me to browse by category. That's a deal breaker
[1:25:08] Eshel: Where do I find out how much they’re charging for the subscription though?
[1:25:11] JLFord78: Can you export your current mods from twitch to this new app? So it'll automatically add the addons I'm using ? Or do I have to manually add them all in the new system?
[1:25:15] sharie: fuck Overwolf back to manual installing
[1:25:28] CaptainAlkohol: have fun being special
[1:25:39] chrisbros: @towelliee will runing old dungeons now give you good usable gear now because of the lvl squish?
[1:25:49] binkz77: wait we have to pay for wow addons
[1:25:56] kaepari: good evening from Nebraska @towelliee
[1:25:57] cozyzequel: I dont see whats so bad about overwolf
[1:26:05] TrowGundam: @binkz77 No
[1:26:07] Solidious_Games: Wait so where will we be getting addons from?
[1:26:16] binkz77: ok
[1:26:32] Avinar: my alt that I farmed warglaives on azzinoth on now wears them as bis since he's level 35 lmao kinda fun to kill with both warglaives
[1:26:33] Kelmor: If it's to support authors, I would much rather do that directly, and to the ones who I like
[1:26:36] flandre619: legion artifact weapon can be like ilvl80ish easily, if you have a fresh 50 character its pretty good to use
[1:26:40] Kraour: @Towelliee do you have to subscribe to download addons . Would really suck for people who cant spare extra money
[1:26:57] TrowGundam: @ZequelGamingTV I've had their overlay blue screen my computer before, back when it first started. Maybe they've improved, but I swore them off after that
[1:27:10] mmrghost7: which ppl dont like
[1:27:17] MissFlux: I went to kill Sha last night on my leveling rogue. No one was there. Totally empty. Of course no one was there - I was set to leveling in Legion.
[1:27:28] PlasticLemons: you can also just download addons and install them yourself if you want lol
[1:27:29] MissFlux: So layering
[1:27:32] Kale_Nd: for me in the curseforge alpha app instead of an app it just shows a black box
[1:27:41] Kraour: Is there a way to safe all the settings from twtich app addons when redownloading them on curse
[1:27:48] GhostChili: Just use wowup

[1:29:19] Moobot: Thanks for subscribing for 9 months, @GOREGAN towHAMUP
[1:29:25] Baldarsar: drops normal and above
[1:29:26] Ortinoth: @mmrghost7 doesn't matter overwolf owns the rights to curseforge, and part of the deal was twitch would stop offering add on support
[1:29:30] Wiggly_Mew: @supers18 a few weeks before launch of SL. whenever that is
[1:29:30] NewWorldReign: Speaking of raiding, how'd Asmongold do with Naxx clear up attempt last night?
[1:29:37] Wubrew87: I cant wait to play D4 whenever that is.

[1:30:53] xmedpakx: of course it will
[1:31:00] trinitygintoki: DO we need to redownload all our addons? Isnt it that the new app will find them on our pc?
[1:31:01] Supers18: Reklusion yeah i agree, but it was so funny seeing ppl say wait until BWL, wait until AQ, wait until Naxx. etc.

[1:36:32] crowsanth: If it was going to be out in November they'd have said so already
[1:36:32] Wiggly_Mew: @doomgarh there is a pre-patch event but that will probably start closer to release of SL
[1:36:41] Eshel: Hey government !! I need another stimulus check !! November is coming !!! lmfao
[1:36:44] streyder: dec 15 release hear my word
[1:36:47] Craetos_: SL is December for 90%
[1:36:49] Doomgarh: Fuck alright just like Cata

[1:36:58] TrowGundam: And taht is unlikely
[1:37:03] TrowGundam: I still say Jan personally
[1:37:07] Grunton: im thinkig dec 13 when the transmog sale ends
[1:37:09] Supers18: Guys he knows, lol he aint bsing
[1:37:14] PlasticLemons: why do you think it wont be november though? @Towelliee
[1:37:15] crowsanth: Early december is most likely
[1:37:15] Kelmor: I was a warrior MT in BC, any warrior tanks that will be doing BC need to go get the Disgusting Oozeling pet ;)
[1:37:22] maddogbg27: @Towelliee Only shit thing for me is SL will come mid peak, so gearing will be a pain in the ass w hen working 60 hours a week
[1:37:26] mmrghost7: he knows REEEEEE
[1:37:30] TheUnknowing: if it comes out in november it will be last week of it, but i honestly believe it will be december
[1:37:34] Solidious_Games: SL should be Jan, I have characters to level up.
[1:37:38] WoW_StandalonE: 15th of December makes sense. or 29th
[1:37:52] Hordec: @maddogbg27 gearig wont be like BfA, np

[1:38:06] TheUnknowing: I think december 15th would be the best bet
[1:38:09] Wiggly_Mew: I doubt it will be last week of Nov because of Thanksgiving
[1:38:11] GarSeason: So you think pre patch is gonna be 2 months.....lol no way
[1:38:12] Supers18: Cant believe ppl still think towel doesn't have inside info, what he says is legit about dates
[1:38:14] sharie: im Calling Early January
[1:38:18] Kinahxi: @Towelliee I play classic with my guild and I wanted to test out chromie time to see tbc for the first time (I started playing wow in legion), but I didn't find that as an option

[1:38:51] GarSeason: @TheUnknowing When in recent history have we had a 2month pre patch?
[1:38:52] Sanityquestioned: They aren't missing christmas sales. You can literally buy it for people online.

[1:39:06] Eshel: No way it’s in January ... they did say “this year” and don’t think they wanna play the semantics game after a delay
[1:39:11] TheUnknowing: Cataclysm @GarHD recent history doesn't matter, in general it matters and it has happened.
[1:39:13] xmedpakx: made my mage an old school troll, happy dance for berserking
[1:39:22] Solidious_Games: @plasticlemons they already have most of the money from preorders.
[1:39:29] TrowGundam: @Eshel Technically the Fiscal Year ends in March, so it could still fit
[1:39:34] Ulfhednard: Can Someone explain me this, I don't get it : " Ravager is meant to allow stacking its AoE with your other global cooldowns, creating greater periods of burst damage. Unfortunately, because of the way Deep Wounds Icon Deep Wounds works, using any other ability which inflicts at the same time is wasteful, which severely limits the damage potential"
[1:39:48] GarSeason: @TheUnknowing Ahh cata was 4 weeks
[1:39:48] PlasticLemons: @Solidious_Games ive got plenty of games as gifts for christmas
[1:39:51] messinna: ps5 in on q19 november.....so is no way SL will be in November
[1:40:01] envel0p: Wait.. did shadowlands get pushed back again? or is it still in 5 days

[1:40:04] MiniPenny: Anyone tried saving dungeon bags till lvl 50 and open them at 50 ? Does it scale ?

[2:12:12] nightlight20: I got umdasta mount my first kill, he was my first world boss and got it ^.^
[2:12:15] TrowGundam: Probably
[2:12:16] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee Madden
[2:12:20] Solid0Liquid: for having copyrighted music on their stream
[2:12:21] Grunton: you will
[2:12:26] othraerir: depends on their licencing
[2:12:29] NewWorldReign: what if the music is from the game itself, is that a DMCA thing?
[2:12:29] Pallananana: Make your own music 4Head
[2:12:35] TrowGundam: People have gotten in trouble for the radio music in GTA, so ya they will
[2:12:43] LoseAlotLuke: what about GTA radio @Towelliee
[2:12:46] Djulio: but you will
[2:12:47] xmedpakx: dont ppl on youtube and IG use music?
[2:12:48] Dundem: Wasnt Elemental shaman supposed to change more than it did in this patch?
[2:12:55] Eshel: Just start playing some blues songs from public domain and I’ll be happy :)
[2:12:56] TrowGundam: @NewWorldReign If the music was made specificalyl for the game, it is probably fine, but if it is just licensed, nope
[2:13:09] Djulio: they licensed the music to use in their game but you can't play it for an audience
[2:13:09] Zoldor: A big part of why they are doing this is because of all the twitch music streams of DJs so they had to full crack down. The game music would be really hard to get through, can it. Yes, will it probably not.
[2:13:09] Moobot: WE DID IT REDDIT! AFTER 2100+ ATTEMPTS WE GOT SHA!! BYAHHHH! towByah towByah https://clips.twitch.tv/BillowingBusyFinchOSfrog
[2:13:14] Ms7Mido: @NewWorldReign yeah like gta is a problem now
[2:13:15] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee but their argument will be is that you are benefiting financially from their content
[2:13:16] Sotonian: VODS have been muted in GTAV streams just for the police siren, shit is going to be a huge mess
[2:13:23] Zoldor: will Twitch ban, yes.
[2:13:34] Grunton: streamers gonna be buying music streaming contracts
[2:13:35] iMaccaPro: RIP my Just Dance streaming career KEKW
[2:13:52] Streamcrush: Everyone knows the DMCA is outdated and weaponized. The reason on one challenges it is because they're afraid of it backfiring, like it did when courts ruled that you could record stuff on to VHS tapes and when they told Nintendo they couldn't stop stores from renting video games
[2:13:55] dutchie76: yea Just Dance is a rip
[2:14:10] LoseAlotLuke: what about GTA radio @Towelliee
[2:14:26] Ms7Mido: gta is radio is a problem now
[2:14:27] Gikhoi: they coming after streamers money - that's a fact
[2:14:31] Vosy1984: @Towelliee Twitch had a Creator Camp last night and that shit had more information about DMCA than everything I found so far
[2:14:33] Sadisticmedic: Mike Chinoda was talking about a Linkin Park drum beat. Led Zepplin was trying to strike them.
[2:14:35] Ms7Mido: gta's
[2:14:38] Atricks95: Mike Shinoda from linkin park was explaining last night no Dropped Frames that he couldn't even get permision to play his own music on his stream
[2:14:47] Gikhoi: i believe they want streamer to pay some form os taxs or something liek that

[2:16:48] Federaldemon: Amazon helping out for FREE? no way
[2:16:54] NewWorldReign: @Eshel Till Michael Jackson bought them out.
[2:16:59] TrowGundam: HA Expecting Amazon to help. Why waste the money? Amazon already isn't happy with the revenue from Twitch, they won't spend a dime
[2:17:25] EggGAMING: SECOND TROOPS!

[2:18:10] Chris_127: and the artists dont even care its actually good for them
[2:18:12] TrowGundam: If it is still publically available they can do it. There needs to be some sort of statue of limiations on it
[2:18:21] Federaldemon: It will cost Twitch/Amazon too much to buy licenses for all music out there, so it will never happen
[2:18:32] caleb191: @Towelliee i ordered the wow stein to drink alchol out of for shadowlands
[2:18:33] Colly_UK: LUL isnt it like 5am for you

[2:19:22] Streamcrush: oh you can stream Amazon Music, but the viewers have to log into to Prime just like they have to for the Watch Parties
[2:19:26] Dundem: Well your first mistake is thinking bezos isnt greedy
[2:19:28] xmedpakx: we can hear him
[2:19:33] Ms7Mido: dmca needs a full rework its so out of touch with our day of age
[2:19:38] TrowGundam: @Towelliee Yes and Amazon music is HEAVILY region locked. That is part of the problem. Twitch pulls an international viewer base, and they don't have the license for that.
[2:19:41] iMaccaPro: yeah they did, the Gothalion got taken down for listening to music in Fallout76 LUL
[2:19:45] iMaccaPro: then*
[2:19:46] Sadisticmedic: @Claylol They threw a ton of cash at FIFA Streamer on Twitch.
[2:19:57] Solid0Liquid: that just means that amazon has the rights to distribute it, it doesn't mean you have the right to use it as part of your entertainment that you are making money off of

[2:21:11] Streamcrush: can I post a link @Towelliee ?
[2:21:26] Excesspace: when you buy a movie (DVD-BluRaw-VHS)... remember the first thing you see on screen when it starts? The warning?
[2:21:36] Ms7Mido: no one watches a stream to listen to music KEKW
[2:21:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[2:21:48] Dundem: theres 2 reasons what you dont understand; 1. You forgot there's no limit how greedy Bezos is. and 2. Twitch isn't really that competent at running their business
[2:21:50] WoW_StandalonE: the point is streamers are making money using music, they want to get a cut of it also
[2:21:50] KingsandClubs: Yeah but where does amazon benefit and profit from doing that ? That’s the main issue
[2:21:58] Claylol: @MS7Midoo maitoz viewers do KEKW

[2:22:28] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee if you weren't benefiting financially from it then they couldn't do shit to you or any other streamer, it would be just like me buying a song and listening to it while i'm mowing the grass
[2:22:30] Ms7Mido: @Claylol oh shit KEKW
[2:22:32] SkeleNinjas: The clip purged happen again?

[2:31:13] JLFord78: IIRC, the Birthday Song is actually under copyright...
[2:31:17] Noshpan: @Towelliee Be careful with playing classical music. I've seen YT videos get DMCA'd flagged for playing classical music because the orchestra could be copyrighted

[2:37:49] TrowGundam: @Maego1 A lot don't, but the record companies taht actually own the rights do, since you are "stealing" their income

[2:39:57] Jastice01: everyone is saying it
[2:39:57] MrPiingo: its just 3 people who do that for levelling
[2:40:03] CaptainTVBot: towelliee just selected a battle and the action begins in 30 minutes! Head to https://www.streamraiders.com/t/towelliee now to place your units and help earn a victory!

[2:40:11] RustproofSage: To use shadowmeld and get out combat and mount up
[2:40:18] C0RV0XGoesGaming: They are going ally to level only
[2:40:22] MetallicusGaming: "everyone is saying it" that's not rly a great source is it
[2:40:23] Silverdevilboy: If they're going alliance it'll be to use dwarf racials for the first raid.
[2:40:24] TheUnknowing: there is no reason to go alliance just for leveling thats stupid
[2:40:25] RustproofSage: THats what Fraggy said
[2:40:29] MrPiingo: its only meeres, naowh and gingi who go for WF60
[2:40:34] AllenzoTV: @IamHasard Just gotta not play DMCA music on the uploads
[2:40:35] Silverdevilboy: scripe has talked about that on stream
[2:40:38] MrPiingo: @TheUnknowing false
[2:40:54] C0RV0XGoesGaming: yeah rep boost for wf level 60 then they back to horde
[2:41:00] TheUnknowing: its not, cause shadowmelds for leveling or rep bonus its not worth it @MrPiingo honestly
[2:41:03] RustproofSage: Fraggy said that will go back to horde as soon as he hits 60
[2:41:04] Marvoholic: DansGaming had to delete 10 years worth of VOD'S
[2:41:12] MrPiingo: @TheUnknowing not if you go for WF 60 mate...
[2:41:20] Silverdevilboy: They won't do that if it's a tactic, same when they switched to trolls for DoB
[2:41:28] xPapio: was there any dwarf changes?
[2:41:45] TallyDaBear: Why all of the VOD deletes?
[2:41:54] Silverdevilboy: Unless they nerf Dwarf in Nathria they're gonna be switching for the raid though

[3:09:20] mediocremoose27: wait im completely out of the loop here is there a post somewhere i can read?
[3:09:23] Khalor__: Can't you get DMCA'd from playing video games?
[3:09:27] danimoto10: @Towelliee was it hard for you to delete it all?
[3:09:32] mmrghost7: Sad af
[3:09:43] Quaras_: @Towelliee what realm are you on, I'll invite you :)
[3:09:44] sharie: by Friday may the Big Spaghetti Monster in the sky have mercy on yoru Livestream

[3:10:03] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 631 units were placed on the battlefield.
[3:10:10] BadXo: when is the Spotify gamer streaming service going live?

[3:10:17] ElPolloBatman: why should twitch bother putting your vods back up?
[3:10:26] Hoetreea: did u get oondasta mount ?
[3:10:29] SnAwPe: Is @Towelliee EU or NA?
[3:10:30] lukaskar: But you can play music if you buy license to stream it or something ( don't know how its called)?
[3:10:42] MKBragg: The record labels are screwing themselves PR wise, instead of going nuclear on streamers they could have just put together some kind of monthly subscription like Monstercat has and I'm positive a lot of streamers would have taken that offer (as long as it was reasonably priced)
[3:10:49] Wiggly_Mew: @alaquane I doubt amazon wants to spend the money on that. when it's easier to just have some delete their vod or deal with the strike
[3:10:50] BoezIRL: question, I just got in. will the future vods be cancellled or not?
[3:10:51] Ruiner_Gaming: So what would happen if there's copyright music in a GAME you're playing? Youtube couldn't tell the difference and dmcaed anyway
[3:10:52] WoW_StandalonE: just coordinate that literally all streamers play music and let them tale all Twitch down KEKW
[3:10:55] Quaras_: @Towelliee Ah you a NA Andy Kappa
[3:10:56] foxies_havocing: why don't they just let you play the music? it's promotion for music makers

[3:11:40] crowsanth: @Towelliee Stream Raider battle is ready
[3:11:54] winsong: @MKBragg the thing is its the production companies hiring 3rd parties to do the DMCAs for them. Because of this the 3rd party gets more money for more DMCA its a bad setup.
[3:11:55] karadeliz: @Towelliee you prob get this a lot, but what are your ACTUAL expectations to Shadowlands?
[3:11:56] MrPiingo: @foxies_havocing thats like saying to a plumber to fix your stuff for free bcs its free advertising
[3:12:02] UthredTV: UthredTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[3:12:02] Moobot: Thanks for subbing for 6 months, @UTHREDTV towHAMUP
[3:12:03] TrowGundam: @Ruiner_Gaming The thing is the game has the right to the music, not you as a streamer. They payed, you didn't. So it is still technically a valid request, the system is just broken like that
[3:12:12] Alaquane: everyone move to that tencent/china owned league of legend streaming platform rooDerp
[3:12:17] xPapio: are you going to try 'StreamBeats' as well as monstercat and everythhing
[3:12:23] ezEmob: this will be a good time for small music makers that will easily give you permission to use there stuff to gget it out there
[3:12:37] Boxxss: biggest true that has every been true

[3:12:45] Alaquane: was meant to target mp3 downloads on napster and shit
[3:12:46] fearxj: @Towelliee wtf you got dmca'd warning from don't you always play wow soundtracks?
[3:12:51] fearxj: for*
[3:12:53] myles0988: where is that boss you were at?
[3:13:04] maladjusted_fc: someone will be taken down as a warning, no doubt
[3:13:09] Khalor__: Maybe if twitch (amazon) loses revenue then they push to change the laws
[3:13:13] Moobot: towW HEY CHAT! Do you have a funny clip of towelliee? Subs AND non subs can now post clips in the clips section of discord! We strongly encourage everyone to get involved to post funny clips of towelliee for future intros and events! towShappens

[3:13:48] Libbzy: no more miracle song?
[3:13:49] Apheelia: I thought those videos just got muted? I hate that you cant listen to real music
[3:13:53] danimoto10: what will you do with your opening?
[3:14:01] ChiefMango: ups, you said their name. Gotta take down the vod now..
[3:14:07] danimoto10: are you legaly paying for it?
[3:14:12] danimoto10: ahhh
[3:14:13] danimoto10: nice
[3:14:14] TrowGundam: @Apheelia The muting software isn't perfect, sometimes it just doesn't catch things
[3:14:29] myles0988: where is the boss your at?
[3:14:34] Siba234: Can you use music that is in the public domain?
[3:14:36] The_Nubtub: @towelliee ah ok awesome man. Once again I hate this for you. Hope everything gets better and wish you luck.
[3:14:40] comicbookrican: SUb Train?
[3:14:43] SnAwPe: f
[3:14:44] Chaosgunner: is there a link to the actual DMCA Filing?
[3:14:47] Ruiner_Gaming: Don't worry, automated systems will still mute you even if you got the rights
[3:14:48] winsong: @Siba234 yes but that is some old music
[3:14:48] myles0988: sick thanks!
[3:14:54] BoezIRL: why are you here?
[3:15:01] graceofdarkness: is monster cat still a thing? wasn't that what people went to before?
[3:15:02] MKBragg: @winsong yeah and one day its going to bite them in the ass, hard, people are getting fed up dealing with this archaic bullshit and these days once the internet turns against you you're in for a bad time
[3:15:03] Apheelia: The streamer music apps stink. I dont like the music on them
[3:15:05] DarkIncarnateTV: i mean its crazy because streamers are giving away free advertisement to songs and people always ask what song that is playing @Towelliee
[3:15:05] KristineTheUnicorn: no more AYAYA ? PepeHands
[3:15:08] pokerigo: lol
[3:15:08] BootySavesLives: this attraction guy has been rubbing it in for a few hours lmao @Towelliee
[3:15:09] Siba234: True, but it's better than nothing.
[3:15:14] BootySavesLives: riding his Huolon
[3:15:14] Torne81: @itmejp had one of the guys from Lincon Park on Dropped Frames today and they were discussing all the ins and outs of this
[3:15:15] DelroyTV: yet he could have trademarked it
[3:15:18] tyrexxi: Montercat rules Rocket league

[3:15:34] Quaras_: @Towelliee you best invite them people there to party to ensure everyone gets tag
[3:15:38] xPapio: think the film industry will join in on the DMCA stuff? i assume there is streamers that use voice clips from movies and stuff for dono sounds
[3:16:07] xImmortalGodx: whats the fastest class to play for heritage
[3:16:15] othraerir: i know a few that do use dono clips
[3:16:19] winsong: @Siba234 would be hilarious to come into towelliee stream and hearing Vivaldi or somthing
[3:16:45] datcreepa: record labels are still living in the past
[3:16:50] ElPolloBatman: you could play stayin alive during one of your 24h streams
[3:16:52] othraerir: i wonder how the metal labels are with this?
[3:16:58] Drakonus: u got sound track by twitch now to just use that
[3:17:10] Kromede: they are making tons of money
[3:17:33] xPapio: its funny how artists have no rights to their stuff
[3:17:34] kriticoal: LUL
[3:17:36] BattleKnoedel: @Towelliee we dont need no music, just sing for us Kappa
[3:17:39] Simajz: yep big true artists dont even know someone got strike for their music
[3:17:41] infinity12402: lmao
[3:17:42] parlangua89: I don’t understand how this is a big deal. Wouldn’t it promote their music?
[3:17:47] JLFord78: I dunno, for awhile, Rick Astley was apparently not happy with the whole "rickrolling" thing, so I heard for a long time his people filed claims anytime they found his song online. I've also heard he's since relaxed on that, though...
[3:17:56] tyrexxi: Hype music
[3:17:59] streyder: copyright protection laws are a joke. they are so far away from reality it hurts... especially in the EU
[3:18:04] Alaquane: Mike Shinoda said he wasn't even able to use his own music. not just linkin park music
[3:18:05] datcreepa: if that was the case why would they be ok with tiktok

[3:18:46] TrendKiLLg: Series of tubes.
[3:18:47] itscodyedwards_: i love that reference holy shit @Towelliee
[3:18:51] DelroyTV: cat6 only son
[3:18:54] TrowGundam: The politcians will just do whatever the highest bidder wants, and taht is the Record Companies
[3:18:56] MetalManGG: hi all
[3:18:57] xImmortalGodx: can anyone tell me the class thats fastest to level
[3:19:04] griffdog125: lol so like a biden
[3:19:05] MetalManGG: how's everyone doing?
[3:19:17] TheCloudbreaker: DH lol
[3:19:17] streyder: @Towelliee how would you feel if you need to play like 50-100$/Month to use what ever music you like (or at least a massive library)?
[3:19:29] Disciple42: lol, that IS what DMCA is, it is vaguely written, broadly interpreted, and was written over 20 years ago
[3:19:31] usagipurin: thats why we need term limits in the senate and congress
[3:19:49] reith__: you'd think sharing music actually helps the music industry but I guess they're getting more money by being unknown PepeClap
[3:19:53] KarasSnowblind: what map mod is that sorry to ask ?
[3:20:15] OtterChiefs: good morning Mr. @towelliee
[3:20:15] Drakonus: on youtube most of the time they just claim the video so they get paid not u
[3:20:16] TrowGundam: @KarasSnowBlind Just part of ElvUI
[3:20:19] BoezIRL: @KarasSnowBlind it's part of elvui
[3:20:20] streyder: @KarasSnowBlind looks like elvui for me
[3:20:21] KarasSnowblind: thx !
[3:20:24] killswiitch: The music industry wants some of that sweet sweet streamer money
[3:20:37] KarasSnowblind: wanna move my addons icons to many around my map
[3:20:37] Staksor: but what if you get DMCA'd live
[3:20:44] OtterChiefs: totally agree
[3:20:44] TrowGundam: That works for VODs, but no live streams
[3:20:49] xPapio: delete VOD and have some kind of demerit system for the streamer
[3:20:52] TrowGundam: And you said youreself that is abotu to happen
[3:21:07] wdotk: or pull all of your vods on mute
[3:21:11] othraerir: more like 50k
[3:21:18] Sandisy: they're responsible for the content creators according to dmca. if they allow the same person to repeatedly break dmca they're also liable
[3:21:20] Bugszy: be thousands of dollars
[3:21:20] Kromede: billions
[3:21:21] love_eggplant: pokimane has it
[3:21:26] TrowGundam: PER SONG dont' forget that part
[3:21:26] datcreepa: that would ruin all the DJs that stream now
[3:21:30] Noshpan: Thousands of dollars
[3:21:39] TrowGundam: It isn't just for a bunch of songs, it is PER SON
[3:21:40] TrowGundam: SONG*
[3:21:45] Drakonus: Beatles licenses would cost tons
[3:21:48] HmmKuchen: then twitch should get licences and then t
[3:21:52] BootySavesLives: music expensive
[3:21:56] Eagle5001: yep walmart radio
[3:21:57] Sincline387: people don't understand personal demand vs commercial use. I used to install the PA systems in stores and no lie 10s of thousands of dollars a year
[3:21:58] Wiggly_Mew: @datcreepa oh it's going to
[3:21:59] killswiitch: Can you not play local radio?
[3:22:02] HmmKuchen: Streamer pay part of it for use
[3:22:09] Staksor: Pretzel also
[3:22:14] DelroyTV: German Streamer Gronkh had to buy a Radio Licence from German authoritys, and he never played music
[3:22:18] geokouts: question : How much Mariah Carey make on her Christmas song each year?
[3:22:18] ekkon21: even "fee
[3:22:22] Eagle5001: walmart radio
[3:22:26] streyder: Well... I see that. But if MILLIONS of creaters with "tiny" audiences pay that, that should be a good deal for the dmca
[3:22:33] ManLikeDrizz: Would you get cooked for DMCA if your sub noti had copywrited music?
[3:22:35] Sincline387: @killswiitch local radio is for personal use not commercial rebroadcast
[3:22:38] Libbzy: Harris Heller is a streamer who made streambeats. Its all music you're free to stream with on spotify its real good
[3:22:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[3:22:48] xPapio: OMG THIS MEANS I WONT HAVE TO LISTEN TO SHITTY TOP 40 MUSIC EVER
[3:22:50] killswiitch: @Sincline387 ohh okay
[3:22:51] love_eggplant: monstercat is only 5 dollars per month to use their music
[3:22:55] TrowGundam: @DelroyTV Germany has some really weird laws about broadcasts of any kind, just being a streamer requires a broadcasting license there technically
[3:22:56] joshball217: So what happens to the twitch DJ streamers?
[3:23:02] kissesaurus: what about classical music?
[3:23:07] delavor1: i mean this is a long time coming, ppl shouldnt be surprised
[3:23:08] ekkon21: even "free" music isn't safe, in a lot of cases it gets taken down because ownership changes and the new owner wants to charge for it
[3:23:08] JLFord78: I work for a local ISP and people will get DMCAd over copying a video and I've heard some fucked up shit. Some studio tried to sue a private citizen for something like $5k PER VIDEO....
[3:23:16] CriticalPhil: @Towelliee the real problem is going to be playing games with copyrighted music in them
[3:23:29] NeoJon82: DJs have to pay their own licensing to use that music.
[3:23:44] Quaras_: What about streamers who have like streams of their bands playing etc.
[3:24:00] Quaras_: Where they cover loads of songs from different singers
[3:24:07] sainnt757: you getting DMCA'D @Towelliee?
[3:24:08] pokerigo: D:
[3:24:11] MetalManGG: I mostly play Rocksmith on stream, literally all my content is copyrighted music and I didn't get hit - it's so odd
[3:24:11] TrowGundam: @JLFord78 They've kind of stopped taht as more than a scare tactic. So many people just couldn't pay so they lost money on legal fees. It is mostly just scare tactics now, at least for your normal every day private citizen
[3:24:12] DelroyTV: praise mike shinoda for putting out new stuff to use while streaming
[3:24:12] othraerir: nah
[3:24:13] mmo_kenna_: I pay for a site called epidemic sound for my content creation
[3:24:17] winsong: @Quaras_ yes you would need to get rights, its the same as a choir performance
[3:24:23] Staksor: @Quaras_ still can get DMCA'd. it just will be easier to remove the strike
[3:24:30] sainnt757: Yeah don't blame you.
[3:24:37] MetalManGG: if Rocksmith gets removed from Twitch, my channel is toast
[3:24:42] love_eggplant: drama?
[3:24:44] love_eggplant: monkaS
[3:24:49] BootySavesLives: monkaS
[3:24:51] KristineTheUnicorn: Just got the Hedless Horseman Mount towHype towPog
[3:24:57] Synopsix: Just curious what do you think the freehold level boost costs now
[3:24:58] Neizrc: dr disrespects songs arent copyrighted always can listen to those
[3:25:01] BioHazmatt: it will prob be the monday, cos who works on the weekend right LUL
[3:25:10] Chibs243: Took long enough
[3:25:15] Chaosgunner: I mean, depending on the way the law is discussed, it may something to look at fair use. Something like the "This coffee is HOT" label for McDonalds
[3:25:23] Sincline387: @BioHazmatt Money crazy lawyers that's who
[3:25:26] BootySavesLives: How many times have you killed this bish? @Towelliee
[3:25:48] TiPera: is there any way to find ur Elvui profile @Towelliee
[3:25:58] vonblue: there will be that one legal guy who will be going around checking it all weekend to try and make money
[3:26:05] haderdaraide: gotta group up you will never tag him if there is a grp

[3:26:07] xImmortalGodx: @Synopsix its like 300k
[3:26:08] sainnt757: @Towelliee so what the music industry is saying is that they want to literally be cut out and replaced with a service that understands how the internet and the industry is changing.
[3:26:11] TiPera: thanks mate @BoezIRL
[3:26:20] haderdaraide: hes a 1 shot
[3:26:23] TrowGundam: @Chaosgunner The games being used as part of streaming would be considered Fair Use, but just using random music as background, not so much. And even then Twitch's system only really lets yo appeal the decision unlike YOutube
[3:26:28] BoezIRL: @TiPera towHype
[3:26:36] xPapio: my heart goes out to everyone who is trying to farm huolon, he scuffed as heck
[3:26:38] Malindan: Huolon has no spawn protection
[3:26:50] delavor1: yup
[3:26:53] sainnt757: They hire these third party music enforcers though, its literally free advertising for music.
[3:26:58] PyroGambler: fun thing is i got this mount first try on my monk when he couldn't learn it LUL
[3:27:01] Glommerwort: Hard to fathom that Amazon can’t cut a deal with publishers.
[3:27:04] sainnt757: They should definitely be paying you guys for playing their music
[3:27:08] Chibs243: @sainnt757 No, what the music industry is saying is pay us for our work
[3:27:13] neorang3r: @Towelliee what happens to the Music category?
[3:27:18] luravi: towelliee show me that vod from 2009 Pandaria!
[3:27:22] xPapio: "i thought it was okay to play copyrighted music" LUL
[3:27:23] cronymahoney: Towelliee has been saying this for years

[3:28:05] love_eggplant: but twitch streamers that are rich can perfectly pay it
[3:28:09] love_eggplant: that want to play music
[3:28:11] sainnt757: @Chibs243 its all free advertising, you know how many times I've added songs to my Youtube Music after a streamers played it. Giving them plays and potentially further expanding there product.
[3:28:13] TrowGundam: The record labels are actually hurting, so they are getting desperate finally. Especially with this year and the lack of concerts and such
[3:28:17] haloinfintes: Do you miss Cata Inquisition Booms and the pvp?

[3:28:18] datcreepa: problem is with the labels is that some of the music is popular because of streamers.
[3:28:24] EpicJune: for me the problem is games that have music than can DMCA you
[3:28:29] Quaras_: @Towelliee you need spam some instant spell to tag him :P
[3:28:36] love_eggplant: that's true!
[3:28:49] delavor1: @sainnt757 you cant pay people off of clout dude thats not how shit works LULW
[3:28:50] basedpyramids: RIP GTAV streamers lol
[3:28:56] love_eggplant: I only have 3 viewers so I can play lots of music
[3:29:03] Malindan: I enjoy you playing wow music. Fits the mood
[3:29:03] SalvinValkyries: @firstbrhere That place epitomizes shitposts. If someone posted something sensible in there, that would be the anomoly.
[3:29:05] Eshel: AOC gets half a million views one night and suddenly Twitch is on the radar ......
[3:29:19] Sincline387: the music labels are looking at the revenue twitch brings in as a total, and if their music is used they want "their" piece. It's as simple as that
[3:29:22] xPapio: 1h long montage of everyone geting live banned
[3:29:22] Staksor: but how do even pay for this? don't you have to pay for each song played and it also depends on how many people would watch you? danHmm
[3:29:24] TrowGundam: @basedpyramids Nah, most of them disabled the ingame radio long ago because it was a problem when the game first came out
[3:29:27] Wiggly_Mew: this was before AOC
[3:29:38] dracullus: @Towelliee dies irae seems like best song for this compilation
[3:29:41] winsong: @Towelliee Siba234 had a good point though. You can play public domain. You can get some exciting Bach or Vivaldi or somthing :D
[3:29:44] Layercake: Pay what? how much? who decides that valor? In what regions? This is so much complicated that ...''just pay and play the songs'
[3:29:44] luravi: eshel watch her play with the 1% of twitch and she is supose to be a regular person but plays with the 1%er's
[3:29:47] enux337: is monstercat still safe?
[3:29:53] Sprucemoose: rip chinglish, he lives on spotify
[3:29:56] Tpickdog: Could clothing labels do it?
[3:30:04] love_eggplant: how about twitch implements a listener, and then auto displays what song is playing? that way, they get free advertisement instead of payment for licensing
[3:30:04] iamchas3r: $250k for a music license just to be able to play whatever you want isn't even worth it for streamers like TimtheTatman, Doc, Ninja, etc.; not to mention smaller folks...
[3:30:09] TrowGundam: Monstercat is the Record Label there, so when they say it is safe it is safe
[3:30:13] foxies_havocing: Tirion LUL
[3:30:15] SalvinValkyries: @Eshel That is probably the most stupid thing I've read in the past couple of hours. You think Twitch hasn't been big until AOC? C'mon man, get your head out of your ass. xD
[3:30:18] delavor1: i thought everyone would be prepared for it by now
[3:30:20] Hieronim89: you can always start streaming on youtube you will be saved from dmca
[3:30:20] Moobot: towHAMUP Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! Learn more and use my link ---> https://www.originpc.com/?aid=864668
[3:30:28] rainbow_egg: Most electronic producers and such are cool with you useing their music
[3:30:31] NeoJon82: pretzel rocks is another like monstercat
[3:30:33] Staksor: @Hieronim89 no you won't LUL
[3:30:40] Malindan: Love monstercat. That label is so good. They know their audience
[3:30:47] winsong: you are NOT prepared!!!
[3:30:48] Eshel: @salvinvalkyries Go fuck yourself - I make a joke and you call me stupid - smfh
[3:30:59] luravi: towelliee do you feel bad for DanGaming for that post of deleting 10 years of VODs you would think he would know but now is farming sympathy
[3:31:00] sharie: whos AOC
[3:31:19] CatsRusOfficial: It needs to be changed to as long as we are using their music and we persoanlly detail what your playing and its evidentaly clear then you are free to play it as its free advertisement for the music label.
[3:31:35] Sotonian: copyrighted music in games i guess
[3:31:35] Moobot: Don't forget that every month you get a free Twitch Sub with Amazon Prime! Step 1 - https://twitch.amazon.com/prime Step 2 - Hit Subscribe on my channel page and HIT THIS BUTTON BABY https://i.imgur.com/XCoETwY.png
[3:31:37] SalvinValkyries: @Eshel Then attach a signifier that denotes its a joke, because if you don't, people will take it at face value. Type properly and you won't have misunderstandings. :)
[3:31:38] LyraNyrnis: @sharie Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[3:31:42] snakebeard: towBam
[3:31:52] enux337: 13 years of memories
[3:32:00] Eshel: @salvinvalkyries Gatekeeping how I type - good guy
[3:32:02] SmokyBlind: who?
[3:32:03] sharie: @Laeminus dont know her but thanks
[3:32:09] SalvinValkyries: @Eshel Found the snowflake.
[3:32:12] envel0p: I feel like if friday is a cut date then they should be like ok from this date on anything that plays copyright music they will actually enforce a dmca takedown
[3:32:12] sharie: @nomoregamesforme thanks!
[3:32:14] TrowGundam: Any content creator is gonna be deleint all their stuff. Hell I've seen some that are just outright disabling all VODs and Clips, just to be safe. Unfortuantely that is what it is gonna take, and with the advent of live takedowns that might not be enough
[3:32:17] SalvinValkyries: Yup. Exactly!
[3:32:26] luravi: DMCA using computer AI to punish regular humans
[3:32:28] wdotk: cant you download them ? keep them ?
[3:32:30] ReinholdtRanger: @Towelliee Twitch should make an integration with Spotify, so that people can connect their account to the twitch and the people watching the stream and hearing the music counts as if they listened to it themselves?
[3:32:31] SalvinValkyries: Streamers cannot feign ignroance.
[3:32:38] EpicJune: yeah they can hit you with a DMCA for like 10 secs of music if they wish
[3:32:43] SalvinValkyries: *ignorance
[3:32:48] tyrexxi: I guess it took u a while
[3:32:48] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[3:32:54] foxies_havocing: it's a safest bet ye
[3:33:05] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee u got Oondasta? :)
[3:33:22] delavor1: im just worried about how this is gonna work with games that have copyrighted music
[3:33:23] HeavyMetta: What bothers me most is the industry aint paying the artist more , they just want all the money in the world like uncle scrooge swim in it , i would not mind if they drown in it
[3:33:24] streyder: So how about some beta keys HeyGuys @Towelliee
[3:33:28] Chibs243: @sainnt757 It’s not free advertising, it’s streamers using copyrighted work to make money for theirself. I don’t know about you, but I insist on being paid for work I do. Why should musicians be any different.
[3:33:28] vibratinglemur: @VerdictoPredicto K Bye
[3:33:29] sainnt757: @Towelliee twitch just added a music streaming beta service
[3:33:33] SpunkyAss: @VerdictoPredicto then dont watch mate???
[3:33:35] itscodyedwards_: @VerdictoPredicto no one wants you here
[3:33:38] rainbow_egg: @VerdictoPredicto Don't let the door hit you on the way out
[3:33:39] cleanstrikes: If their VOD system can flag and mute, then it should also add a delete function @Towelliee
[3:33:39] TrowGundam: @VerdictoPredicto C ya, don't let the door hit you in the ass
[3:33:45] ZyntosAran: @Rueverte that would be cool. A lot of people are using spotify anyway, so it would be cool to just integrate that. Smth like a playlist the streamer can control, and you can just listen to it with your spotify, and control the sound
[3:33:50] Auru: some people still dont care. Ive been watching 20k+ viewer streamers just have music on and not give a F.
[3:33:52] Staksor: nah, it has happened
[3:33:56] SalvinValkyries: Yeah, that will be rough for sure.
[3:33:56] Staksor: just not a lot
[3:34:04] xPapio: dont IRL stream in the mall
[3:34:08] Staksor: it has
[3:34:14] sainnt757: @Chibs243 They do get paid, exposing people to your music is literally free advertising.
[3:34:19] delavor1: tbh it is a pretty good deal twitch got for us
[3:34:20] joshball217: Not to make it sound over important, but it’s such a shame that veterans have to delete entire VOD library ‘s, because that is forcing people to delete a part of history. This platform changed the Internet, and now a large part of it is disappearing, and no public record of it will exist
[3:34:34] mackieeswe: facebook does the same live @Towelliee
[3:34:35] bhadgaming: its crazy , instagram had a similar issue with people going live and playing music . if they didnt pin the message " I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THIS MUSIC" there live would be terminited .
[3:34:36] luravi: how on earth is it a good deal firstbrhere
[3:34:37] Staksor: no, a streamer was DMCA'd live for streaming a movie. he didn't save a VOD
[3:34:39] Chaosgunner: Wasn't there a woman that got banned for accidental nudity?
[3:34:40] Staksor: Nymn
[3:34:44] Danrip: He means they haven't been banned live for DMCA
[3:34:45] lelpena: fifa song LUL
[3:34:47] cronymahoney: IRL streamers are going to have a tough time streaming now
[3:34:48] MrSupernoodles: soda had so much DMCA music on last night didn't seem to give a shit lol goodluck to him
[3:34:53] Silverbella: Thank you for the gift sub, comicbookrican! towGift
[3:34:54] trinitygintoki: @Chaosgunner Not only one bro xD
[3:34:55] crowsanth: Best I can do is a fiver
[3:34:57] ShockASU: towLul
[3:34:58] TrowGundam: Just watch the record labels are so desperate they'll find the shit on something like the Internet Archive and DMCA you anyways
[3:35:00] tyrexxi: Pog
[3:35:02] Chibs243: @sainnt757 That is nonsense. Pay people for their work, end off.
[3:35:04] Malindan: So how about stuff like fifa that uses licensed music
[3:35:04] KnoNock: Are there back ups?
[3:35:05] streyder: @Towelliee I can do 3.50$
[3:35:06] Darkbrawny: pog
[3:35:06] xPapio: is it an SSD or a HDD Kappa
[3:35:07] crowean: 7 millions
[3:35:07] BootySavesLives: LULW
[3:35:10] BootySavesLives: DEAL
[3:35:11] Jorwen: KAPPA
[3:35:12] SalvinValkyries: lol
[3:35:13] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee i can go up to 5 bucks that's it XD
[3:35:14] catlinv: i GOT ABOUT 3 FIDY
[3:35:15] Riddlz: LOL
[3:35:19] ShockASU: HOW BOUT TREE FIDDY?!?!
[3:35:19] Macroversal_: I got some lent
[3:35:22] delavor1: @luravi because the music industry is in their legal right to claim every single vod of twitch and twitch negotiated an out
[3:35:24] Sincline387: @joshball217 Not to be a dink, but there have been so many warnings about this the community has really brought this on themselves.
[3:35:25] BoezIRL: I can do 5€
[3:35:27] sakura_2020: about tree fiddy?
[3:35:27] Just_Say_Yo: burn it!
[3:35:30] Sneui: 1 million korean won!
[3:35:33] talkinnootnoot: how can they go after twitch but not youtube ?
[3:35:33] xPapio: i got a 5er and some mac n cheese bro, you in?
[3:35:33] Macroversal_: lint*
[3:35:35] HeavyMetta: Its emotional memory , people who buy it will not even watch it its a collectors item
[3:35:35] Jokervenom1978: ONE AMERICAN DOLLAH!!!
[3:35:42] KnoNock: That's cool
[3:35:45] Malindan: Monopoly dollars
[3:35:47] fluffy_Pennington: hi I'm new here, what is that "T" light behind you? never turn your head to the right and open your mouth that would be weard ^^'
[3:35:50] luravi: firstbrhere oh go away with that nonsense outdated thinking
[3:35:52] TrowGundam: ha expecting Amazon to lift a finger to help, not if it will cost them a single dime
[3:35:53] Sandisy: For Houlon you need a macro with /target houlon and /cast <instant dmg>. spam the moment npcscan alerts, it is a few seconds before it shows
[3:35:53] Coriollis: twitch is in a pinch, they either have to enforce this and in process kill part of their platform which means less value or ignore it and risk a neverending lawsuits with records which Amazon does not wanna go to bat for it , idk 15 years ago music might be a solution ?
[3:36:05] ZyntosAran: @penningtonxx !dick
[3:36:06] Chizsle: theyre not deleted, they are just hidden from the public
[3:36:06] delavor1: @luravi its the law LUL
[3:36:12] ZyntosAran: damn
[3:36:13] Rottencoarse: btw guys did he get oondasta today or yesterday?
[3:36:26] delavor1: maybe the law is outdated but you still have to abide by it
[3:36:28] luravi: firstbrhere sure i bet your 80-90yo as well
[3:36:31] kriticoal: true Kapa
[3:36:33] HotHotHeals: aka that real content
[3:36:34] ZyntosAran: @penningtonxx well, its a palmtree
[3:36:35] bhadgaming: lol
[3:36:36] BoezIRL: right
[3:36:40] thisrandom: Have you gone back through Nylotha yet?
[3:36:44] BoezIRL: true true
[3:36:50] Chaosgunner: Don't they have strait up music livestreams? What if they are remixing music?
[3:36:51] RiskySaber: There is music in your stream ?
[3:36:54] MetalManGG: I mostly play Rocksmith on stream, literally all my content is copyrighted music and I didn't get hit - it's so odd
[3:36:58] parlangua89: Lmao word 😂😂
[3:36:59] Macroversal_: didn't even notice you played music until you said something
[3:37:02] xPapio: RIP beatsabre
[3:37:02] vibratinglemur: I feel really bad for music streamers right now
[3:37:07] Just_Say_Yo: DJ streams may die I guess
[3:37:08] Coriollis: yeah other use it to empower their content, others use it as filler and so on multiple uses of it
[3:37:09] humpish: still you are using it to make your stream more apealing and thus gaining from having music
[3:37:10] cronymahoney: Towsanta rocks it out on the other hand LUL
[3:37:11] Cinni_Bunni: There are some VR chat mutes that dance to music. This will hurt them.
[3:37:12] sainnt757: @MetalManGG thats cause they h aven't found you yet.
[3:37:12] MetalManGG: if Rocksmith gets removed from Twitch, my channel is toast
[3:37:12] Chibs243: Is it only mechanical copyright that is being enforce or is intellectual copyright also being enforced?
[3:37:13] Drakonus: Cuban yapping or Old lady towelliee syndrome
[3:37:15] Staksor: you won't be able to stream Cyberpunk
[3:37:18] BlindFaithFuel: Its cool that you're being an example for what TO DO for other streamers when it comes to this. Even though its a crap situation.
[3:37:19] othraerir: so, live music creators couldn;t even cover songs?
[3:37:21] Staksor: or GTA
[3:37:22] Wiggly_Mew: @chaosgunner you better have the rights to play it or you will get a DMCA
[3:37:25] BootySavesLives: it spawns in a 30m window ye @Towelliee
[3:37:27] funKShun: I have the problem the other way around, I like the streamer but I hate the music that he listens and can't watch the stream @Towelliee
[3:37:30] BootySavesLives: yep right here @Towelliee
[3:37:32] Deathchampt: what if you play a game that has music in it?
[3:37:42] Staksor: @Deathchampt you're fucked
[3:37:43] Quaras_: 30-60min Kappa
[3:37:43] CollateralDamage25: I do like Lirik hearing when he plays music after his stream is over

[3:37:51] Macroversal_: gl
[3:38:04] xPapio: idk how it is now but in MOP he'd spawn by the cliff in front of you up high ish
[3:38:08] Coriollis: did LKirik got a strike for EuroTruck radio vod ?
[3:38:14] funKShun: you can always put it on youtube
[3:38:22] Malindan: Same spot everytime but no spawn protection. That's why you group.
[3:38:29] CriticalPhil: like asmon
[3:38:36] Chaosgunner: People who can't deal with that will just go to Chatturbate or something nutty.
[3:38:37] luravi: towelliee can i have a clip from 2009 when i won 30 days of gametime from you in a raffle? plz k thx :)
[3:38:47] fluffy_Pennington: dit asmon got banned?

[3:39:22] BootySavesLives: monkaS

[4:05:50] cabalish: @Carnazy !rarity
[4:05:53] TrowGundam: No they don't, Kickstarter rewards aren't guarnteed
[4:06:00] streyder: wildstar was so nice, but reworking half the game two weeks before launch was maybe not the best idea
[4:06:01] Lintgamer: its a kickstarter. They dont need to do anything

[5:18:16] audderd: Damn i enjoyed watching old leveling marathon vods
[5:18:17] MrGattz: you watch, absolutely nothing will happen on Friday. im putting $20 on it
[5:18:18] TrowGundam: @Kisswani lots of games use licensed music, which while for the game is fine, doesn't mean you have the right to broadcast that song
[5:18:19] xhaven: @Towelliee will non affiliated or partnered streamers even have to worry about their vods?
[5:18:20] NBK_Sethus: Bezos didn't make enough money off the pandemic to afford music FeelsBadMan
[5:18:26] odizs_: What is going on that everyone is deleting vods ?
[5:18:27] MaleFrom73: No more "we need a miracle" on box opening day?

[5:18:56] the_bad_goat: So wait I can’t go back and watch your fuck it Friday vods now?
[5:18:57] Thoreya: No more marathons to watch on vods anymore. That’s so sad rip
[5:19:02] TheCliffyShow: I already got one ban on Twitch. I don't want another one.
[5:19:13] TrowGundam: @Kisswani Like ALL of the Fallout games have that problem. GTA Radio music has been problematic in the past too.
[5:19:15] MrGattz: @91Niki not for free Kappa
[5:19:22] Incredible_Sausage: oh man, JP has so many too
[5:19:29] 91Niki: @MrGattz Well if something does happen, can I get the 20 bucks ? LUL

[5:20:28] Finvey: its especially shitty for those that dont have their content on YT or soemthing else
[5:20:30] Finvey: just gone
[5:20:35] 91Niki: You would think that Twitch cared enough about their website, viewers and streamers that they would work on a system or a deal with the companies or something... But hey

[5:20:48] TheMoysterOyster: Sorry, I don’t know what Twitch apocalypse is.
[5:20:52] Kisswani: @Rottencoarse we have one of Cohh's mods in chat . i should have tagged him i guess
[5:20:55] TrowGundam: Cohh wil have to delete some stuff. Some games he couldn't put on Youtube becasue of DMCA issues. Those VODs wil have to be deleted as well
[5:21:00] MrGattz: @ShockASU how do you not know your his mod NotLikeThis your fired Kappa

[5:21:08] Rottencoarse: @Kisswani ah didnt know sorry XD
[5:21:08] TheCliffyShow: I stopped playing copyrighted music after the last purge. And yesteday, I deleted all my vods, highlights, and clips. I already got banned on Twitch once. I'm taking no chances.
[5:21:12] n0vaes: Its fucking sad.
[5:21:12] Kisswani: danSad
[5:21:19] CaptainTVBot: @towelliee The battle is ready to begin! 800 units were placed on the battlefield.
[5:21:24] ShockASU: MrGattz Red who is charge of YT does a good job with claims. Only thing I could think that might go are playlists made on Twitch that were put there due to the music.
[5:21:28] jasonbriggs: good luck on mount
[5:21:31] ShockASU: MrGattz RUDE cohhK
[5:21:38] Meowzorzs: love dan

[5:22:06] Darkbrawny: raider up @Towelliee
[5:22:07] MrGattz: @ShockASU LUL but yeah fair enough, red does do a great job with it. i would assume nothing will change though
[5:22:13] rik1st: DRAPO
[5:22:16] ipendora: Welp more snow here
[5:22:16] Thoreya: Welp if everyone gets banned twitch is RIP. Hopefully they’re working on trying to make this not happen again
[5:22:16] ShockASU: Rottencoarse cohhT
[5:22:17] Maverik_TKE: did I miss the abyss wyrm drop?

[5:22:51] Secondbreakfasttt: why would you <3
[5:22:55] TheCliffyShow: Maybe they will add the Frog dude!
[5:23:02] MrGattz: cohhEvil
[5:23:04] TrowGundam: @Thoreya Twitch ain't doing shit. THey are passing the buck onto the streamer and making it all their reponsibility. Not reason for daddy Amazon to spend a dime trying to help
[5:23:16] TheCliffyShow: Where you looking at this @Towelliee?
[5:23:32] MiniPenny: So I made a test about the Dungeon end bags. It scales all the way up to level 49 (iLvl 57). Then at 50 it stays at ilvl 57. So if you want to save your lvl 10-49 bags to open later it kind of works. Why you want to save them ? Thats another issue :D
[5:23:34] ShockASU: MrGattz I know they talked about it on Dropped Frames for awhile yesterday. I was at work all morning so missed if anything was said. Would guess nothing would change
[5:23:35] Thoreya: @trowgundam I don’t get that tho. So they’re just gonna let their business die? If big streamers get banned they’re fucked lol
[5:23:38] ShockASU: Rottencoarse cohhL
[5:23:44] dylandevsstuff: fireknight?
[5:23:45] MOLAR305: thanks
[5:23:47] TheCliffyShow: When they teased upcoming new champions a while back one was a frog. Another has the mouse girl.
[5:23:49] dylandevsstuff: or dragons lair
[5:23:54] audderd: Are you going to upload your vods to YouTube
[5:23:59] shmegflam: @Towelliee Whats the halthbar/cd add on you use in WoW?
[5:24:03] MOLAR305: yea fire
[5:24:07] shmegflam: healthbar*
[5:24:09] MrGattz: @ShockASU yeah i watched DF but i cant remember if anyone said they were deleting vods
[5:24:22] Illson91: @dr4p3au Nice my last name is Drapeau
[5:24:24] amricatt: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:24:30] Brodih_: @ShockASU Do Cohh's mods share a schedule or its whoever is available to mod does it ?
[5:24:45] Kromede: after Kappa
[5:24:47] Shrenko: allready PepeHands
[5:24:49] TrowGundam: @Thoreya What are they gonna do though? They aren't gonna pay the thousands of dollars a month for streamers. They are doing wwhat they have to cover their ass legally and just removing the content. Any "bans" are for repeat offenders, and is largely automated.
[5:24:52] TheUnknowing: after - noon
