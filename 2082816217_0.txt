[1:40:44] Phatori: not 2
[1:41:22] johncriton: depends on what they decide
[1:41:37] thmpr324: @phatori do you honestly believe the entirety of 60 content will have the same length as these mid level brackets
[1:41:54] Alcaeus_: I am interested on the timeline they metion a phase 4 and then an end game phase
[1:42:05] Molvonos: We experienced a VDH in a 20 a few days ago in Everbloom.
[1:42:12] Dudutoolbox: what  happens after sod?
[1:42:15] Molvonos: They pulled half the needed mobs in one pull.
[1:42:20] Molvonos: And we obliterated them all.
[1:42:24] Phatori: @thmpr324 Potentially. But it could also go longer and whats the issue with that?
[1:42:45] Sollice: @Towelliee Too early to stand?
[1:42:56] johncriton: i wouldnt mind faster leveling
[1:43:02] im_capy: I think SoD roadmap is a little more loose depending on the server pop
[1:43:03] Sollice: ok
[1:43:31] thmpr324: @phatori having 4 established raids + what ever new content they have in store for 60 makes that impossible lol
[1:43:52] im_capy: Boost flask, just makes you 40 LUL
[1:43:58] Phatori: okay so it lasts longer thats not bad.
[1:44:01] pm3488: what is the warlock tank rotation?

[3:53:20] nuuenergy: yes
[3:53:42] kaeleirra: Wedding
[3:53:55] kaeleirra: It was so much fun.
[3:54:07] Jango_: Kind of what me and my wife did, some family was pissed but most were happy
[3:54:24] kaeleirra: Honeymoon wedding , reception later. We did it backwards.
[3:54:29] Aravarth: A wedding != a marriage. My wife and I had a beach wedding with JUST our parents, and then finished our PhDs like 18 months later, and then planned the big "wedding reception" 18 months after we got married.
[3:54:50] Aravarth: ^ IMO that's the way to go tbh.
[3:55:05] Kaykerrs: the way to go is whatever you feel like doing
[3:55:12] Kaykerrs: not what everyone else says is the best way
[3:55:29] Aravarth: I mean, that's fair — it was the way to go "for us".
[3:55:42] kaeleirra: It's a piece of paper really. We plan to renew our vows in two years so everyone can be apart and I will wear my wedding dress that I wore on the beach.
[3:55:49] Aravarth: @Towelliee We had a full-on wedding reception, like 140 guests, rented hall, etc. We were just married already.
[3:55:59] Kaykerrs: that's a great way to go though for sure aravarth, glad yours worked out like that!
[3:56:58] Kaykerrs: zhro and I gonna drive up there since it's only a few hours away and we gonna crash your wedding towel
[3:57:04] Kaykerrs: :P
[3:57:14] Aravarth: It wasn't cheap, that's for sure. But thankfully our parents footed the bill.
[3:57:30] Kaykerrs: don't let Lula kill us
[3:57:44] kaeleirra: We explained to both sides of the family party the weekend after we return. Worked for us. I Didn't want to be walked down the aisle by two dads that didn't do shit for me growing up and my moms are not much better.
[3:57:56] ClassicMalcontent: Ours was about 120. Friend who lives in Hawaii had his at the Hawaii Convention Center in downtown Honolulu with easily 300 guests. (2/3rds her friends fam as she's 1/2 Japanese 1/2 Polynesian)
[3:58:19] kaeleirra: Hubs family treats me like their daughter.
[3:58:27] Kaykerrs: Les
[3:58:29] ClassicMalcontent: That was the largest wedding I have ever attended.
[3:58:31] Kaykerrs: You are a lyin' ass bitch
[3:58:37] Aravarth: Honestly, we weren't even planning on having a massive party, but everyone else wanted "the massive party", so we were like, "If you want the massive party, you can pay for it" lmao
[3:59:06] gmike66: mind sear op

[4:11:49] Djfarmville: you can do it in 3-4 blooms if you are lucky/efficent

[4:32:14] im_capy: truuuuuu

[4:37:57] Molvonos: I heard Les is leaving WoW to lead a raiding guild in Palworld.
[4:38:22] im_capy: If they can figure out a way to let GDKPS in, while gold coming from just the token/trading.....itll be another ATM for them
[4:38:24] ClassicMalcontent: *The moment Towelliee finds out Les was a gold buyer* Kappa (thankfully not!)
[4:38:34] 3663Sharad: "... and this folks is how the Towel and Les incident happend." LUL
[4:39:13] ClassicMalcontent: I ended up grinding my mount (heard its less gold now or soon?) just from killing elementals and selling drops, selling gray junk and mining
[4:40:01] im_capy: Same, never done them but just know so many people seem to hate them with a passion
[4:40:22] im_capy: I got friends to play with, so its whatever for me

[4:41:00] im_capy: "go get em tike"
[4:41:07] ClassicMalcontent: Just prevents streaming GDKPs basically. Discord still exists for anyone not streaming during the raid if its one that was not announced in-game.
[4:41:48] ClassicMalcontent: I think its Devastate before Sunder... or something
[4:41:50] expbottles: u still on illidan for retail?

[4:43:12] im_capy: @91Niki PowerUpL towHype PowerUpR
[4:43:16] Kaykerrs: Nikiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
[4:43:17] valianya: I suspect that the GDKP ban in SOD is an experiment to control the game economy inflation.  With mount prices reduced and no need for massive gold amounts for GDKP, there's not much incentive to farm huge amounts of gold or buy gold from RMT gold sellers.  Less demand for gold in SOD means it keeps the economy from inflation like Retail suffers.

[4:45:01] ClassicMalcontent: "Welcome back 225k accounts for 100% xp and 300% gold buff!"
[4:45:07] im_capy: Blizz should just add their own bots and buy out the gold selling websites and 200IQ everyone
[4:45:08] ClassicMalcontent: Welcome back bots! Here's a buff!
[4:45:12] ClassicMalcontent: Kappa
[4:45:33] 91Niki: Oh yeah, if it is an evoker, on the default drake farming herbs and ore, 90% chance it is a bot
[4:45:37] im_capy: / whoe
[4:45:39] the_general01: a mess
[4:45:41] im_capy: who*
[4:46:02] valianya: I think it's too early to tell.  Less gold buyers because less demand for huge amounts of gold, so less reason to bot, will eventually lead to fewer bots.  But it's a trickle down effect that won't happen immediately to reduce bots and sellers
[4:46:18] im_capy: @91Niki so the druid is out now and the Evoker is in I see
[4:46:54] 91Niki: @im_capy Well there are druids still. But evokers are so easy to get to dragon isles. That is why they use them more
[4:47:06] ClassicMalcontent: @im_capy as Evokers start at high level in Retail

[5:30:49] borkensonbork: @Towelliee how do you feel about the whole WCLRankingTooltip thing?
[5:31:56] borkensonbork: Xaryu and Sardaco posted videos about it
[5:32:25] borkensonbork: It puts parses in your tooltip for players
[5:32:25] Derca_: its like raider.io for classic
[5:32:55] Derca_: the addon is gone now though
[5:33:23] Derca_: it used warcraft log data, they requested it be taken down
[5:33:55] Derca_: no sorry, warcraftlogs itself. it violated their ToS
[5:33:58] borkensonbork: I think WCL requested it be taken down
[5:34:01] Rexy95: i think logs did
[5:34:02] borkensonbork: but its back up on patreon now
[5:34:16] Rexy95: gets less trafic to warcraft logs for adds ;)
[5:34:20] borkensonbork: muh ad revenue
[5:35:12] Derca_: the dev of the addon used someone else's username/token to fetch the data
[5:35:47] borkensonbork: yeah seemed pretty sus. apparently the new version is from a new dev tho

[5:37:08] LimpyMcGee1: sp is a pretend mage
[5:37:21] valianya: Isn't it against WoW TOS to charge for addons so putting it behind Patreon pay wall could get users banned or the addon banned?
[5:37:37] Molvonos: @Kaykerrs If I had a better healer, I wouldnt have died.

[5:38:31] borkensonbork: @valianya they use the same loophole as all the guide paid addons. The DB's of data are what you get for the patreon sub, the addon itself is 'free' but does nothing without the DBs
[5:39:17] geokouts: party like it is 1999

[6:09:05] hammack52: warrior will be back on top by 60, they scale to much for them to not be
[6:09:36] Kaykerrs: lmfao
[6:09:40] Kaykerrs: you're bold to assume that
[6:09:47] Kaykerrs: everyone thought they were gonna be good this phase

[6:11:10] im_capy: I thought we were talking about a warrior at 60, not next phase
[6:11:28] hammack52: i dont even play warrior but i have been watching them climb the charts, warriors are always shit at the start of a tier or phase
[6:12:03] mozavich: honestly, i'm glad that warrriors aren't the best at everything in sod like they were in classic vanilla
[6:12:07] Molvonos: Me and Zhro typically go head to head on Overall damage
[6:12:12] PleaseeStop: melle hunter and warrior pump
[6:12:13] Molvonos: He does better in single target, I do better in AoE.
[6:12:20] PleaseeStop: ahhh

[6:12:47] suunascasa: Cata was when I really started to play wow for real, cant wait for it, thats also when I started watching you on youtube! @towelliee
[6:12:53] ChalupaBatman25: ret and prot paladins could use a buff. a lil depressing seeing ret paladins at the bottom with tank dps
[6:13:05] zhr0: @Molvonos Frenemies
[6:13:10] zhr0: in raid
[6:13:11] Gungre: Ret's just got a huge buff
[6:13:19] Kaykerrs: zhro has really good gear, still not enough for crazy parses sadly
[6:13:22] Gungre: The change to martyrdom is insane for them
[6:13:27] Gungre: You just need jackhammer or acp
[6:13:44] zhr0: Warr requires consumes/world buffs and raid built around them to perform well
[6:14:03] WoWEnder: are you maining Lock in SoD?
[6:14:06] Kaykerrs: lmao zhro doesn't know what world buffs are cuz someone always causes him to die
[6:14:30] zhr0: "That's funny every time I enter this tunnel my world buffs are gone" - Les
[6:14:51] zhr0: OMEGALUL
[6:14:57] Kaykerrs: LMAO Les
[6:15:07] hammack52: i wish they would just do away with the world buffs that or just put an npc in the raids that let you pick them all up, they are all just toxic IMO
[6:15:44] Kaykerrs: o.O
[6:16:06] zhr0: How the DMF cooldown works before being able to refresh is really annoying
[6:16:10] hammack52: its not the buff it sell its the way people treat the damn things
[6:16:14] im_capy: could be like a crafting food or something
[6:16:33] hammack52: i have ben in to many groups that as soon as one person dies and looses there damn world buff they just leave

[6:17:04] mozavich: the problem with world buffs is that they're centered around parse culture. and that in itself is just a toxic environment.
[6:17:20] im_capy: people get salty when they die with WB, even if its a easy clear
[6:17:28] hammack52: alot of the time the group just disbands
[6:17:30] Bowwjack: @Towelliee I think the biggest thing is that people make them required to do the conent and it's rediculous tbh.
[6:18:05] hammack52: there was a reason blizzard stopped doing world buffs if tbc

[6:19:11] Kaykerrs: Literally people would do the minimum and not do shit to better themselves for a raid
[6:19:17] Kaykerrs: I think it's good they have to get off their ass and get a buff

[6:21:24] Todumbtodie: specially when you can store them now it's not hard to get them
[6:21:25] im_capy: Usually, the people that dont go for WB or anything, seem to be unprepared or undergeared a lot of times too.
[6:21:33] zhr0: Why not go to the raid with buffs/consumes to perform your best to not waste 9 other people
[6:21:37] zhr0: people's time*
[6:21:40] Kaykerrs: Yes zhro
[6:21:53] WoWEnder: nowadays people just dont want to do anything outside of the raid which is fine but dont expect to be brought to groups who do put in outside work
[6:22:00] pharohhhh: Buffs and consumables I agree with but not taken people because their class isn't an s tier class kinda sucks
[6:22:01] mozavich: back in vanilla, there used to be a bug with Benediction/Anathema where they enchant the weapon and then change from Bene to Ana or vice versa, and the enchant would disappear. My poor +22 intellect enchant.

[6:29:53] Kaykerrs: haha I didn't have the blood moon luxury sadly
[6:29:58] im_capy: I feel like people used a lot to pay for monthly subs if anything with the gold they earned
[6:30:17] CousinAvi86: GDKP's also only transfer the gold around, its already earned/bought. Questing generates more gold into the economy
[6:30:19] pharohhhh: Could probably get good gold just levelling an alt
[6:31:34] im_capy: ya kinda hyped for it being added to peacock
[6:32:14] im_capy: yup
[6:32:32] CousinAvi86: ya, I think the 300% gold increase is worse
[6:32:40] CousinAvi86: since they arent doing shit about bots anyway
[6:33:07] Ocenus: quested since the start of phase 1 then phase two dungeon grinded i have no where near 200g ESPECIALLY after I got my mount at 90g

[6:35:10] crich85: is it better now to level an alt from 25 - 40 then gold farm on my main?
