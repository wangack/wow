[1:17:38] Malinoric: just like the actual race
[1:17:43] mikstab: Echo who?
[1:17:44] OnlyABanana: alhamdulillah

[1:17:47] ramen_junkie: tactical cauterize kek
[1:17:47] Nox1o: maybe it was liquids plan to have a lifeline for halondrus LUL
[1:17:48] olivoilolja: liquid will wipe again
[1:17:48] ingweeeee: isnt Limit 0-4 on check points?
[1:17:53] ChocoboLord: Not sure if double ret pally is the play
[1:18:05] Rambo_One2: Do they have repair bills on the tournament servers?
[1:18:13] tobias_funk: @ingweeeee jeez, just waited out your timeout only to come trash talk more?
[1:18:17] Mharad: Ok ! Liquid getting Ws today Pog
[1:18:21] ThisIzD: Scotts gonna solo anduin again
[1:18:23] Naguura: there are only 2 checkpoints, 1 was after the first 3 bosses (echo was first) and the other checkpoint is after anduin

[1:18:37] pandinitv: can we get boss teleport on live pls
[1:18:38] muse_less: mathnos
[1:18:53] ChocoboLord: Why is Echo playing mostly Dwarves while Liquid got more horde?
[1:19:05] reggiepowa: who will answer questions from liquid, max?
[1:19:05] Rambo_One2: Omg that would actually be a good affix, breaking the gear. Another would be forcing them to do the meta achivement LUL
[1:19:16] ingweeeee: how is asking if Limit is 0-4 on check points "trash talking"? you need to have an inferiority complex
[1:19:18] Nox1o: @Naguura will Echo be able to "skip" if liquid finishes the checkpoint. Lets say halondrus is giga hard without lifeline and they need another 10 pulls
[1:19:37] Naguura: no, you cant skip bosses
