[6:50:55] farmeronskis: @Azulmentegris you need to be in 1 of 4 correct quadrons, if ur in the wrong one it does alot of dmg. reason they are wiping is because the quadrons change pretty fast and people dont move quickly enough
[6:50:57] TitaniumMuff: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[6:50:59] Mojosodope909: @Hype960 no you didnt

[6:52:20] TheWarox: it was fun in Wotlk @shroud
[6:52:23] Bragez: @doranttv mmos are generally easier to understand when playing them you self. since you are gradually getting to know more and more about the game. when just watching like this, you have it all in your face with no real context.
[6:52:25] cls33: How old are you?
[6:52:26] shlumpeet: @shroud you didnt do this in wotlk?

[6:52:47] SkeletalArkeus: I only did this raid in wotlk
[6:52:47] farmeronskis: @shroud many mechanics are simple but punishing
[6:52:48] Hype960: @MOVlES im kidding i have no idea
[6:52:48] FloWin: naxx has the best mechanics but yeah 40 people was crazy to all do the right stuff

[6:54:13] emanueld29: @PempaLive I might go open-back though. The only reason why I didn't go open-back yet is because I can't find any good open-back wireless ...
[6:54:14] frankattv: the warlock hellfires LUL
[6:54:15] kryot1c: basically back in the good ole wow days naxx was the ultimate t3 dungeon Pog loot Pog Mechanics Pog difficulty not just for shitters
[6:54:15] makatsi: @PempaLive I got the arctis pro wireless, it's fucking amazing, BUT way to expensive for me normally. I got it as a gift for my birthday and I fucking love it. would never spend that much on headphones myself tho
[6:54:16] Bragez: @Azulmentegris mean theres not comming more content to classic. this is the final raid. then BC will launch in some months
[6:54:16] NotyDV: @EmanuelD29 im like you hard to take the risk.. arctis pro its a lil bit expensive tho

[7:59:53] Bragez: @Rustiee12 its kinda grindy and a big time investment. especially classic. retail wow has more space for super casual play

[8:01:07] DS303: @Itzwowx meme opinion
[8:01:10] The_Pixel_Monk: @Itzwowx retail is way harder actually lol. your obviously not a player of both
[8:01:14] whheell: what happneed?
[8:01:15] MannySJ: @neoarcadias it's 2004 technically
[8:01:28] farmeronskis: i dont get why people wage war between classic and retail, both are wow and both are good
[8:01:35] TheOfficialGameChannel: yeah the textures are a bit too smooth but they gotta be able to let the potato pc's still run it somewhat
[8:01:36] Bragez: @Rustiee12 retail should be fine. theres a lot more space to just play a couple hours here and there. do some dungeons etc.
[8:01:37] thenarddoggg: they are saving buffs chat and taking a break and game planning
[8:01:38] dead5ace: all wow is good
[8:01:40] farmeronskis: wow players unite

[8:02:07] Toung_foo916: should have rocked hunter Shroud
[8:02:08] Hype960: Retail and Classic are the exact same amount of difficultly Kappa
[8:02:13] MoonzenTV: Actually the PREPARATION for the raids is way harder on classic and time consuming, but the raid itself is harder on retail
[8:02:15] dead5ace: @Hype960 it all depends both have different things that make it more challenging
[8:02:16] farmeronskis: @Hype960 does that matter? most ppl on retail dont do mythic anyway
[8:02:17] MannySJ: You leveled a summoner, good guy shroud
[8:02:19] htfyb_el_gregie: Ok
[8:02:23] headhunterog: @RealTubsie i spent hours too so i want my loot so i can play the game not help one guy build up!Other games have more balance in that

[8:04:05] pepper137: does retail still require a subscription or is it a one time purchase
[8:04:17] The_Pixel_Monk: @13pepper13 retail and classic are the same sub.
[8:04:22] bobberto77: do a lot of people still play classic bros? or is it mainly 60s doing raids?
[8:04:23] Hype960: @13pepper13 u wish it was free
[8:04:24] WhoTheHellisMogli: is chat talking shit? less than 20 guild cleared world and I doubt you guys did it

[8:04:30] Bragez: @13pepper13 sub is required, but you can buy sub tokens for ingame gold
[8:04:35] gooble38: they're making sure they dont waste their buffs, right?
[8:04:36] farmeronskis: @13pepper13 it does but you get classic and retail with same sub
[8:04:39] Hype960: @WhoTheHellisMogli are u dumb? 20 guilds?
[8:04:40] thenarddoggg: ya
[8:04:42] thenarddoggg: saving buffs

[8:06:09] The_Pixel_Monk: @Schwongles The raid he is doing right now is the very last content the game has, so its ending
[8:06:13] Bragez: @Schwongles try out both, its 2 rather different games all in all. but yes, this is the last patch of classic. TBC will come out at some point. but, if you play retail, you have access to classic anyways
[8:06:16] Hype960: @WhoTheHellisMogli are u talking about rank 20 in classic or vanilla?
[8:06:19] ermaltopalli: shroudH
[8:06:20] Gokyzu: woah mom?

[8:33:01] ermaltopalli: !936p
[8:33:02] StreamElements: @ermaltopalli, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.

[8:55:15] DasGreatBrit: @Miracle__Rogue yep, progress EU cleared it
[8:55:21] dash_yy: @treesflowers WoW classic raid
[8:55:24] Azrael_rgt: @treesflowers big boss needs spans spores, they need to be destroyed by groups, the heals need to be made in a specific order for the tanks not to die, lack of coordination is killing the group
[8:55:26] Zen_21: @treesflowers as far as I understand (not a wow player so bare with me) they are doing a raid, this is one of the bosses in this raid, they are trying to play around boss mechanics and keep healing tanks(?) in cycles but somehow failing(?)
[8:55:31] Hype960: @EmanuelD29 appreciate that <3
[8:55:49] emanueld29: @Hype960 tbh thats what autopsy says, no one understands why they die
[8:55:50] hardstoner: Amos gold is god
[8:55:52] ilegaI: @zen_21 correct
[8:55:57] darkfr4mes: this boss is a heal fight bcz they have just 5 secs to heal everybody
[8:55:57] Dimitri_L: Is there a version of wow that doesn't require a subscription?
[8:56:04] VoylRL: @poltronaquente Why are you here then
[8:56:04] emanueld29: did asmon actually clear this boss with his guild? lol
[8:56:06] VoylRL: shroudWat
[8:56:06] ceguinhuuu: why is he doing naxxramas?
[8:56:07] rey915: yea a free trial
[8:56:08] newtee2: @dimloz PRIVATE SERVER
[8:56:16] draxse_: @dimloz good private servers lol
[8:56:17] captain_knackarsch: @poltronaquente why are you watching it then? selfpunishment?
[8:56:21] shadorien: when you use healing spell, there is cooldown on any healing spells like minute, thats why there is healing order
[8:56:22] consentreceiver: how u so broke you cant cough up $15 for a sub
[8:56:22] ilegaI: @poltronaquente PVP is awesome pve is hard as u can see and u can't afford the subscription
[8:56:22] MurdaAta: Where is the sword from southpadk whem you need them😂😂
[8:56:23] Moon_Man_Miles: @poltronaquente that almost sounds like.. your opinion! wow! let shroud enjoy what he wants LUL
[8:56:26] Azrael_rgt: @treesflowers the spores give a debuff i think,
[8:56:28] Onemuri: @treesflowers Each healer can heal only once per min, so they rotating. Its a debuff. Also they need to finish the boss before 5 mins or wipe
[8:56:30] MannySJ: You out here getting innervates? tf LULW

[8:57:02] Bragez: anyone here knows the name of a channel mod? I have a question
[8:57:02] meister1337: shroud did you see that theres a new csgo operation out as well?
[8:57:03] ketchgg: whenever a healer casts a heal they get a debuff that stops them from healing for 30-60 seconds. so they have to cycle single heals on the tank to keep him alive
[8:57:06] Darksparkh: yep
[8:57:08] emanueld29: @Aint1_ i mean shroud's raid is really good compared to asmon's i believe isnt it?
[8:57:10] darkfr4mes: healers cant heal while the necrotic aura is up
[8:57:16] spankernz: LOL GAMER BEARD
[8:57:16] Miracle__Rogue: so, naxx cleared day1?
[8:57:18] veiloflonelystars: @poltronaquente retail mythic raiding is challenging

[8:57:19] itzzDovah: other wings arent gonna be anywhere easier
[8:57:21] vixeum: @shroud u guys might have to focus on getting to this fight with world buffs
[8:57:21] all_encrypted: is shroud ele for real?
[8:57:22] Ciderbeard: is it the same Gaara that was big in Hearthstone?
[8:57:23] darkfr4mes: 100% heal reduce
[8:57:25] MasterEmpun: you need 12 healers
[8:57:26] vampz77: i definitely dont miss this

[8:57:33] trippintrippy666: @emanueld29 yes they couldn't even get to this part of boss
[8:57:33] Darksparkh: you need more rogues and warlocks for this boss, if i remember right
[8:57:34] Aint1_: @EmanuelD29 can't say at all, its the first time im seing Shroud playing wow

[8:57:55] nofrontin: with my mage you would kill it for sure Keepo
[8:57:57] trippintrippy666: @aint1_ it definitely is asmons guild is worst on server
[8:57:57] hookatv: monkaW
[8:57:58] emanueld29: @Aint1_ yeah dont get me wrong im not talking about shroud or asmon themselves, its about the people in their raids.. shroud's people seem far better than asmon's imo
[8:57:59] Onemuri: Very expensive boss for consumables
[8:58:01] Aint1_: @EmanuelD29 but yeah I would believe Asmon's raid are more experienced
[8:58:01] sirkab0b: @MannySJ LMAO
[8:58:02] turamb: Loatheb and Four Horsemen are two of the hardest bosses. Abom Wing is easier
[8:58:04] MurdaAta: I have the usb with the sword guys #southpark 😂😂
[8:58:04] weiceshi: Why do you keep jumping? Do you run faster if you keep jumping?
[8:58:06] Hype960: WoW classic health numbers are so much nicer, this is not debateable
[8:58:06] vixeum: chat isnt patchwerk the biggest dps check?
[8:58:09] emanueld29: @trippintrippy666 they wiped at the boss where you have to dance through the acid?

[8:58:50] Darksparkh: rogues mages and warlocks are top dps at this boss, i really dont get it why ppl even bring so many warrior dps, i know they do damage, but they are overrated for classic raids
[8:58:51] hyphysharky: shroudInsane shroudInsane shroudInsane shroudInsane
[8:58:55] Death_Dono: @Sactastic i know, but the mechanic from it is fun :p

[9:00:04] Eraiiko: vanilla warriors were a tanking class ... even in pvp needed an army of healers
[9:00:05] Darksparkh: @vtrix_ttv from world buffs yes, but where is world buff now? any good rogues should be able to do more dps as any good warrior

[9:08:53] fukayamuda: just tuning in, guessing we had a wipe. Hate to see it
[9:08:53] Spearki: why is there a 400dps difference just in top 8 of your dps that shouldn't happen
[9:08:55] Sno0pyP: naxx is way more then gear checks
[9:08:57] Darksparkh: @ynokidneyshottho you must either be mega stupid, jealous or trolling and you are ignored
[9:08:58] emanueld29: what about the weakest dps switch to heal spec if they have one and weakest heal switch to dps spec, if they have one :o
[9:08:59] Zuggernautz: the spores should give u enough crit to down him, dps has to be the issue
[9:09:02] Sno0pyP: 1st actual raid

[9:09:26] VoylRL: Can you bandage the damage?
[9:09:29] JonGoober: Why can you only heal once every x amount of seconds?
[9:09:30] WKeyAccount: @spearki its just the ignite damage. The top mage is probably stacking crit
[9:09:32] DeviSTatoris: they fck up spore buffs and end up losing overall dps
[9:09:36] JonGoober: Is their a cooldown or something for healing?
[9:09:37] soul_c_: @dra it was? i thought no one cared about Nax since TBC came out
[9:09:40] redRAID3R: @dragul4 horseman was the guild breaker

[9:09:52] twitchunt: one "beneficial" spell per minute, which includes all heals as well as decurse etc
[9:09:54] DrBogart420: @shroud first doom comes at 2 min mark, then every 30 seconds until end of fight
[9:09:54] sorenmills: ye should get some gear from other quarters and come back with better dps
[9:09:55] Darksparkh: you need more (good) rogues and warlocks, mages should be top dps in that fight too
[9:09:56] nofrontin: get some nightfin soup mana pots and keep those tanks alive LUL

[9:10:57] WKeyAccount: @shroud You could try arthas gift for your tank. It adds a +8 damage debuff on the boss for all melee

[9:32:27] icebearkr: new csgo operation shroud
[9:32:27] DakkonRz: @shroud your problem is that your last 2 healers in the rotation are 2 offspecs. ideally the 2 off specs (you and shadow) should be between 2 strong healers to help mitigate your low healing. Sry to spam, just trying to help

[10:25:38] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.

[11:28:07] CaptainRogers0704: im just waiting for the tank to die, and wipe right after lol
[11:28:07] KohdCilver: @obsolitgaming you need to have different people getting spores
[11:28:08] raakis: @shroud have you checked if every healer is using max rank heals?
[11:28:12] AllDayADK: iguess ally can juts bring a few pallies and lay on hands .. op op
[11:28:26] rinlojmjolnir: @shroud did you know wadu is talking in stream not just wadu hek. like hes talking
[11:28:35] notmaxmax: that second tank should be a warrior is the main issue
[11:28:37] ilegaI: @alldayadk LUL that's what I've been saying
[11:28:37] obsolitgaming: range dps should work right for the spores
[11:28:38] KohdCilver: he knows
[11:28:44] notmaxmax: druids have no CD's to live
[11:28:55] Valiseer2: theyre playing the fight on hard mode by having the boss move around and melee getting parried. theyre giving the boss parry haste and making tank take way more dmg
[11:28:55] AllDayADK: tranq/innervate
[11:28:57] obsolitgaming: ohhh need another tank for those spores
[11:29:00] MannySJ: Bop yeah

[11:29:12] Marcus_Helius: Would make sense for the range dps to take care of spores
[11:29:14] Cessil: no, you can only bubble the impending doom shroud
[11:29:16] bananaplanets: mages should be starting with frost until one gets spore to start the ignite aggro free, mage shouldnt be pulling off the get go that is what cause issues right there

[11:29:21] swagga1248: rip DayZ
[11:29:23] dabsss714: yes spores

[11:29:27] Zinou03: @Schnarffy those were the days
[11:29:35] Unka_B: pally tier 1 has a chance to heal party on hit that shouldnt count
[11:29:38] Crusaderino: Soviet double pull aggro >.>
[11:29:39] obsolitgaming: mages have debuffs or disables? should work on spores
[11:29:39] feisal1: is that new raid guys ?
[11:29:45] mholmes: pallys still so good here tho
[11:29:49] illuvian: why dont they just rotate between 3 tanks so that its not all on Lance? am I missing something?

[12:25:26] perefourah: deep prot is not more mitigation than fury prot
