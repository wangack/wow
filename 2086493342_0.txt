[0:32:18] Jecikalba: axeumSip
[0:32:26] Cutencuddly73: well they jsut gave rdruid a 12% buff and holypriest nothing so no clue

[0:33:05] Iridiumspx: they nerfed the CDR on salvation going into this season
[0:33:06] laha1n: im asking because when they seem not to change healer classes its because theyre nuts in pve but i have no idea
[0:33:29] Iridiumspx: last season hpriest could get salvation down to like a 3-4 minute cooldown and now it's more like 5-6
[0:33:38] desowl69: You definitely still need apotheosis for regular BGs but epics salvation really shines
[0:33:44] Cutencuddly73: @laha1n think theyre jsut a little scared because symbol of hope used to be so broken in pve so not sure what theyre doing but its pretty low hps wise
[0:33:54] Yoskexz: channKek channWeen samiSS1 samiSS2 dewWings

[0:36:54] Owlcopwn: low rating solo, you dont lose to bad lobby's, you lose to peoples mental exploding after round 1 xD
[0:37:08] Cutencuddly73: @laha1n but yeah not really sure what theyre doing healing wise im so shocked rdruid got a 12% buff when theres 3 specs worse than it hps wise *shrug*
[0:37:11] iggy_pls: so is pres gonna dominate on fated season
[0:37:44] jekxz: is this 10.2.3?

[0:40:12] Cutencuddly73: yeah you getting a flat 12% buff so will pump more and MW got nerfed a bit so i think theyll be competitive with mw after buff

[1:08:56] Treemanm: all lobbys 50/50
[1:08:56] Intravz: big war dam
[1:09:09] laha1n: @cdewx hate to keep spamming my same stupid take but you think a pure healer mmr buff would help?

[1:12:12] Doolz51: Sorry to off topic...but, Are there any good healers in arena that use VuhDo or Healbot? I wanna heal, but id want to use VuhDo I think

[1:52:13] JahOCE_: this dh is extremely suspicious
[1:52:15] JahOCE_: nice
[1:52:56] Spreeflow: wow
[1:53:15] JahOCE_: all of this guys sigils are pixel perfect character model in the middle
[1:53:24] boocraft1992: I dont get it. why do healers get less points then dps?
[1:53:31] JahOCE_: mmm okay
[1:54:00] Lathrien: because healers get more games
[1:54:01] laha1n: pretty sure its saturation, fewer healers mean less mmr comparison
[1:54:13] Spreeflow: @boocraft1992 because they are vsing 1 healer, where the dps is vsing 3 other players
[1:54:28] laha1n: probably a combination of all these things
[1:55:07] obviouslytai: thats correct. u cant just give people mmr its based on where your placed not just a number
[1:55:10] Lathrien: vs 1 healer or 3 dps has nothing to do with it. the game just takes the lobby average for dps whereas healer its only the other
[1:55:19] boocraft1992: @Spreeflow healers often times don't carry though unless 1 healer is like hilarious better. If both healers play passively 30 yards out it usually just depends on the DPS that carries that lobby more so
[1:55:24] Glowerss: If dew was a dps he's not gonna get much CR from this game either because he's lost so much CR his MMR is gonna be not gr8
[1:55:24] wizards_0f_zargon: chuck is top 3 players in the whole game
[1:55:35] Lathrien: so healers sometimes get wildly inconsistent mmr/rating differences
[1:55:43] wizards_0f_zargon: im not just saying that cuz im subbed
[1:55:46] wizards_0f_zargon: hes top 3
[1:55:53] reaperz14: chat how many points did he get from that
[1:56:10] buffevoker: Chuck is top 3 oldest players in the game
[1:56:12] zachgamegodx: @wizards_0f_zargon whose #1
[1:56:16] Lathrien: @wizards_0f_zargon top NA wow streamer. all others are dogshit and have mental problems
[1:56:23] obviouslytai: Dew are their situations you use healing wave over surge?
[1:56:23] zachgamegodx: swifty or bagera?
[1:56:24] laha1n: thats true too, fewer healers means that to curb queue times, at least in the past, blizzard put healers at lower mmr into higher mmr lobbies to simply make the matches happen
[1:56:36] Spreeflow: @boocraft1992 too mee, it feels like healers carry cuz that extra cc from 1 healer changes the game
[1:57:09] mayfire15: yall doing main team tonight dew?

[1:59:23] Glowerss: Was it one of your first shuffles ever?

[4:47:44] BalancePK_: @ably I tried some rsham games and wanted to cry after.
[4:47:52] Zacaree55: @custerbug yea the advice is to reroll and learn arcane.
[4:47:56] Zacaree55: And dont play frost
[4:47:59] Zacaree55: Or you're in for a bad time
[4:47:59] ably: @BalancePK_ i play pres and disc Stare send help
[4:48:15] Zacaree55: @BalancePK_ I could do it but idk if i have perms to add emotes.
[4:48:19] BalancePK_: @ably I thought those were both good rn?
[4:48:37] ably: @BalancePK_ disc worst healer in the game, pres is the worst shuff healer (stat wise and teammate wise)
[4:49:02] BalancePK_: I've been trying to get glad since nam
[4:49:07] custerbug: @Zacaree55 really i thought the best one was fire then frost then atcane
[4:49:13] BalancePK_: but i wish i could just be a meta slave but the game doesn't feel fun like that
[4:49:28] ably: @BalancePK_ respectable. i dont like the meta abuse either
[4:49:30] Zacaree55: Nah Arcane is the better of the mage specs rn
[4:49:35] Zacaree55: atleast from what i know
[4:49:47] custerbug: @Zacaree55 is frost not getting a buff
[4:49:55] Zacaree55: Yeah a 0.5% buff
[4:49:56] ably: DH arent good at anything but pressing blade dance
[4:50:17] Zacaree55: I have a r1 frost mage that i talk too everyday and he thinks the changes wont amount to anything.
[4:50:17] beef_00: DH dont need to swap when death sweep cleaves their whole team lul xd
[4:50:30] grayrose_LKP: Arcane vs. Frost comes down to comp. Arcane has more damage but Frost has more control vs. melee.
[4:50:34] BalancePK_: LMAO
[4:50:37] custerbug: @Zacaree55 is that good ot not worth it, i bassically knoe nothing about the game
[4:50:45] BalancePK_: i'm committed to enjoying this game but damn
[4:50:52] Zacaree55: Just look at it like this
[4:50:57] Zacaree55: If frostbolt does 30k damage.
[4:51:02] Zacaree55: and they buff it by 25%
[4:51:07] Zacaree55: It'll go up to like 38k damage
[4:51:10] yepx1: sick bubble
[4:51:21] Zacaree55: Whereas as Arcane you can do 200k blasters.
[4:51:26] Zacaree55: and kite forever.

[5:01:40] BlackOut1309: i swear, introducing solo shuffle  was one the most toxic shit that's ever happened with this game
[5:01:56] Zacaree55: Its also the funniest
[5:02:02] Zacaree55: because it shows how bad the general playerbase is.
[5:02:05] Jecikalba: axeumSip

[5:03:51] prolyphicttv: bro i miss seeing mes on his DK
[5:03:56] Shablagoosh: @prolyphicttv ret war to close out the expansion just like shadowlands
[5:03:56] Zacaree55: We all do
[5:04:02] Zacaree55: but when DK is so shit
[5:04:07] prolyphicttv: @Shablagoosh pretty much
[5:04:08] Zacaree55: Hes gotta do something else.
[5:04:22] prolyphicttv: @Zacaree55 agreed im not doggin him for not playin it
[5:04:36] Zacaree55: like blizz showed their hand
[5:04:40] Zacaree55: when in the last round of pvp tuning
[5:04:40] prolyphicttv: just sucks, cuz i learned a lot from his DK gameplay (and petkick too)
[5:04:41] BlackOut1309: next expansion i guess we might see mes on dk, this one is done for sure
[5:04:43] Zacaree55: that we got. after 5 months.
[5:04:47] Zacaree55: DK's got nothing
[5:04:57] Yanzoh: LUL LUL

[5:05:13] beef_00: he parries
[5:05:18] addyz0r: 5% parry xD
[5:05:33] Aro725: o7
[5:05:34] Germ777: ppl are actually trash i agree dude
[5:05:41] Germ777: greedy
[5:05:43] Yanzoh: this is exactly why you should not take SS too seriously lol. its a fckn jungle compared to 3s lol
[5:05:44] Zacaree55: Is this an 0fer?
[5:05:48] BlackOut1309: blizz just gave up on retail, they just do next exp and sod
[5:06:14] prolyphicttv: @BlackOut1309 they had what..5-6 patches for SOD before this one for retail this next tuesday?
[5:06:37] prolyphicttv: took them 3 months to fix a "bug" with DH tier set with throw glaive procs
[5:06:43] Zacaree55: I dont think they gave up on retail
[5:06:46] BlackOut1309: @prolyphicttv yep, i guess so, things are fine on retail LUL
[5:06:54] Zacaree55: Cuz i think they are happily prepping for 10.2.6 and s4 for PvE
[5:07:00] Zacaree55: But they def gave up on PvP.
[5:07:09] Yanzoh: ^
[5:07:09] prolyphicttv: @Zacaree55 the fated season kappa
[5:07:34] prolyphicttv: the real change we need is the conquest sword added to vendor instead of some butt plus aspirants wand
[5:07:44] BlackOut1309: @Zacaree55 dont want to doom it before it happens but mark my words, 10.2.6 and next season is gonna be useless
[5:07:47] prolyphicttv: plug*
[5:08:03] Zacaree55: I mean we know that
[5:08:11] Zacaree55: Next season is just filler until TWW
[5:08:21] Merican_Gamer: i just hope mes win 4 FeelsGoodMan
[5:08:32] Zacaree55: Im interested to see what 10.2.6 is gonna be since they were all hush hush about it
[5:08:35] Zacaree55: but im not expecting much
[5:08:51] jrweeex: is 10.2..6 next week?
[5:08:55] BlackOut1309: @Zacaree55 ye but in SL they at least tried to make season 4 fun, in DF they wont even add new affixes in raid or change dungeons
[5:08:56] Zacaree55: Possibly
[5:08:59] beef_00: big win
[5:09:06] Zacaree55: They dont have 8 hour maint for no reason
[5:09:12] Zacaree55: And its predicted to be out in march
[5:09:25] Doolz51: I thought it was always predicted for april
[5:09:28] Aro725: @BlackOut1309 aint no body want affixes in raid anyways lol. They were ass in SL
[5:09:30] asenku11k: war losing to lock/priest is prei crazi
[5:09:45] Zacaree55: @BlackOut1309 yea they havent released any info on s4 yet either so just leads me to the worse case scenario
[5:09:47] itsahehefromme: thats what they teach u in conflict free communication seminars
[5:09:57] Zacaree55: @Doolz51 nah 10.2.6 is always been predicted to be out sometime in march
[5:10:10] BlackOut1309: @Aro725 they were fun and changed the way u play bosses, this time you're gonna farm same shit u've beed doing for past 1.5 years
[5:10:10] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:10:13] prolyphicttv: @Zacaree55 this 100% . we just know its going to be a "fated" season whatever tf that means
[5:10:25] Zacaree55: @BlackOut1309 i just hope its not all DF dungeons for the M+ season or i might actually quit the game until TWW
[5:10:37] Zacaree55: Like give me a decent fucking dungeon pool to do keys for the season
[5:10:46] BlackOut1309: @Zacaree55 i might be wrong but they said it's gonna be all df dungeons at once
[5:10:47] Zacaree55: Since my favorite game mode PvP is dog shit.
[5:11:06] Zacaree55: I remember that too but i know alot of the big time M+ people are up in arms about it
[5:11:17] prolyphicttv: @Zacaree55 ayy but rated bg blitz! carrot on the stick!
[5:11:24] Merican_Gamer: @Zacaree55 i hope its only azure vault and ruby life pools in a rare fated 2 dungeon rotation FeelsGoodMan
[5:11:26] itbeHootie: @Zacaree55 It's okay to take a break, healthy even
[5:11:26] Aro725: @BlackOut1309 I mean technically no one had any clue what they'll do for fated. But if you want affixes back you must have just done heroic. Cause doing that shit on mythic was aids. The one with all the orbs that insta lagged everyone out was alright cause you did big dam. The rest were trash
[5:11:37] Yanzoh: PvP is fine. blizzard does everything they can to make sure we have a shitty experience, everything is normal.....
[5:11:56] lefraw: chat is ret any good?
[5:12:06] prolyphicttv: ret/warr/fw is goated
[5:12:06] Zacaree55: @itbeHootie This is true. Thats why i dont currently play outside of doing keys with friends.
[5:12:20] ably: @lefraw ret has great dmg/burst and good util for shuff, ye its good
[5:12:21] Zacaree55: @Merican_Gamer Wouldnt mind this tbh
[5:12:25] BlackOut1309: @Aro725 i did full mythic with my guild first week, ye there were lags but bosses felt different
[5:12:33] lefraw: @ably Thanks!
[5:12:37] Zacaree55: Fated Raids were ass. Unless you do just heroic
[5:12:40] BalancePK_: alright
[5:12:40] Zacaree55: Then its w/e
[5:12:42] Aro725: different and good are totally different
[5:12:44] BalancePK_: i'm going back to maining rogue lma
[5:12:53] DrDickels: lmao the warrior jumped down and los the pally
[5:13:02] Yanzoh: LUL
[5:13:05] Zacaree55: ???
[5:13:07] Zacaree55: Fuck you Chuck
[5:13:12] itbeHootie: @Zacaree55 I agree but the devs need more time to work on the next xpac or it would suffer
[5:13:16] Zacaree55: Warriors for life.
[5:13:16] VenoTV1: Good morning my lovely stair puncher, much love from sweden <3
[5:13:25] VenoTV1: chair puncher*
[5:13:28] prolyphicttv: feel like DH and Warriors just full int every lobby
[5:13:30] BlackOut1309: @Aro725 im not asking specifically for affixes but make some shit so i can feel im not doing same bosses all over again
[5:13:35] kelfeno: how is pres doin with melee cleaves these days?
[5:13:45] Zacaree55: @BlackOut1309 exactly.
[5:13:47] Zacaree55: Like
[5:13:47] kelfeno: @prolyphicttv Sir that is their job
[5:13:51] Zacaree55: make it different and flavorful
[5:13:52] Zacaree55: not
[5:13:53] Zacaree55: just
[5:14:00] prolyphicttv: @kelfeno a good pres can do extremely well into cleaves
[5:14:02] Zacaree55: "hey heres an extra mechanic that might be a pain in the ass"
[5:14:04] Merican_Gamer: @prolyphicttv he win 4 EZ
[5:14:36] Zacaree55: Did you guys know that DH's are like Gojo Satoru? He win EZ Clap
[5:14:51] prolyphicttv: @kelfeno yeh their job is to full int and have baked in mechanics that are dog shit for the game
[5:14:58] Aro725: Yeah Im with ya. I just hope its not like sanguine and grievous on Sarkareth, Have fun lmao. I also dont have high hopes for s4.
[5:15:22] itbeHootie: I feel for the devs tbh.. they create all this content all for it to be irrelevant the very next patch
[5:15:23] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:15:31] Aro725: it feels like a cop out tbh. SL was different cause it was covid or whatever. But 3 raid tiers and whatever s4 for DF just feels like a let down no matter what they do
[5:15:56] Zacaree55: Yea. Ill prob do the fated raids once or twice to get a full set of heroic ilvl tier for keys and get my dinars for my trinkets and call it a season for raids.
[5:16:10] Aro725: yep, I think thats what most will do.
[5:16:30] Shablagoosh: they at the very least better give us another unique mount for clearing all fated raids on heroic again

[5:16:32] Shablagoosh: like the slime cat
[5:16:45] kelfeno: @prolyphicttv sry i meant playing with a cleave. i'm having a hard time walking the line between being in range for heals/pressure and not getting cc'd
[5:16:50] prolyphicttv: itll be a cash shop purchase @Shablagoosh
[5:16:53] Aro725: Good new is theres a new poe season soon. And PoE2 in july. Plus cataclysm. I wont be back to retail till TWW probably lol
[5:16:57] Sk1Sk1: he LoH you
[5:17:02] beef_00: 75% damper
[5:17:12] Yanzoh: mes and lock are now just gonna smash the warr lol
[5:17:25] prolyphicttv: @kelfeno with melee cleave i assume?
[5:17:34] Zacaree55: yea im lookin forward to Cata
[5:17:37] Zacaree55: It'll be a diff game now
[5:17:43] Zacaree55: since we know so much more than we did back then
[5:17:44] kelfeno: @prolyphicttv ya ret/war basic
[5:17:56] Zacaree55: Still think RLS doms the ladder though
[5:18:01] Aro725: Yeah I think catas going to be very fun. But i also still enjoy wrath so im a bit braindead i suppose
[5:18:11] Zacaree55: I loved wrath but
[5:18:13] Zacaree55: my guild died
[5:18:13] Zacaree55: so
[5:18:16] Zacaree55: it died for me too
[5:18:17] prolyphicttv: @kelfeno as long as you guys play around a pillar, you should be able to do whatever youd like. only time this isnt the case is a good rdruid
[5:18:20] Aro725: yeah :/
[5:18:28] Zacaree55: shame too cuz i was 34/50 on my shadowmourne. never gonna get to experience it :)
[5:18:35] ably: when do you guys think they'll stop doing classic xpacs? we getting a classic mop? Pog
[5:18:35] Zacaree55: and i cba doing GDKPs
[5:18:47] Zacaree55: We most def will get a classic MoP
[5:19:04] prolyphicttv: @kelfeno when your dps move, move yourself accordingly to a spot thats relatively close to a pillar to dodge kicks and CC. also gives you better spot for rescue
[5:19:08] ably: hopefully they skip classic shadowlands dewLUL
[5:19:19] Zacaree55: Most people are hoping they blaze through cata and get MoP under development. Because that'll be the best Classic will get
[5:19:24] prolyphicttv: @ably they need to stop at legion because everything after is ass
[5:19:32] ably: @prolyphicttv legion was great too
[5:19:38] Zacaree55: Disagree. They could do BFA again and i wouldnt be mad
[5:19:44] BlackOut1309: @Zacaree55 god please no more daily quest, i cant do it second time
[5:19:46] beef_00: oh my
[5:19:51] Aro725: @Zacaree55 10000 percent. And im going to take a leave of absence from work and play that shit for a year straight. Then i can quit wow. LUL
[5:19:56] prolyphicttv: you want to get 1 shot by corruptions and trinkets again in BFA?
[5:20:03] Zacaree55: yea
[5:20:08] Zacaree55: I want my double tendies slappers back
[5:20:09] ably: that or get 1shot by dh in retail YEP
[5:20:12] prolyphicttv: fair...at least youre honest
[5:20:17] Aro725: id play BFA again too tbh
[5:20:19] Zacaree55: The issue with BFA wasnt the content
[5:20:25] Zacaree55: It was the length of content droughts.
[5:20:26] Aro725: corruption was S+++ tier
[5:20:29] prolyphicttv: the weekly chest says otherwise
[5:20:31] Merican_Gamer: @prolyphicttv yes, i will run twilight devastation as blood dk in solo shuffle EZ
[5:20:34] patrickheadeyes: Hello cdew, you roasted me for my take on pibb being the best soda, un called for
[5:20:35] yoitshesi: bring back corruption gear pog
[5:20:42] epicpockettroll: how about legion?
[5:20:42] Zacaree55: You gonna check out Cata chuck?
[5:20:48] Zacaree55: Come back and play a lil RLS?
[5:20:49] prolyphicttv: @Merican_Gamer may the lord forgive you for your sins
[5:21:05] Aro725: Hes going to play it and get hooked
[5:21:14] Zacaree55: Come play RLS with me and Trill on Bene :)
[5:21:22] Shablagoosh: we might be in sods final phase by then
[5:21:22] Zacaree55: Well maybe not me and Trill
[5:21:24] Shablagoosh: or shortly after
[5:21:29] Zacaree55: but just Trill and another r1 KEKW
[5:21:35] patrickheadeyes: ok if i am wrong what is the best soda my friend, perhaps i am the pibb emissary trying to gauge interest
[5:21:37] kredz13: hopefully cata brings back the 3s scene
[5:21:39] Aro725: rsham is sick in cata though
[5:21:42] FrostmagicED: the curse of content creation
[5:21:46] bubblebuddyx_: classic cata should have a tourny realm open to every1
[5:21:47] Restartlife: fotm wow is the only way to play Wow
[5:21:55] prolyphicttv: Cata fangs of the father RMP will reign supreme
[5:21:56] fiendrlz: they should start new cycle instead of cata, classic-tbc-wotlk
[5:21:59] Simiseed: You answered the question i guess many times. BUt i wasnt here longer. Why dont play SOD? its fun as fuck
[5:22:00] FrostmagicED: no one plays old xpacs for pvp
[5:22:08] Aro725: Yeah with them not doing content update patches itll always suck for pvp.
[5:22:08] FrostmagicED: MoP miiiiiiiiight be interesting
[5:22:13] FrostmagicED: becuase everyone had everything
[5:22:19] ably: MoP FeelsGoodMan
[5:22:22] DontDv8: random question, does anyone know if there is an active wotlk season?
[5:22:24] Aro725: Like you know whats bis the whole expac. No tuning changes is rough for pvp.
[5:22:25] epicpockettroll: kek all the rep farms in MoP LUL no thank u
[5:22:28] prolyphicttv: Mop was SO diverse man
[5:22:31] vblindside: challange modes bis
[5:22:33] patrickheadeyes: if i never played cata, is there a meta that is solid throughout the whole xpac?
[5:22:36] ohsomagical_: meanwhile DH/LOCK/Healer
[5:22:37] kebobmeister: remove all addons from the game and old content will be super fun
[5:22:39] prolyphicttv: you could play any spec for the most part and be competitive
[5:22:44] michyx337: unfort df is dogshit too (
[5:22:51] xanuka_tv: LSD is one really op comb
[5:22:56] Zacaree55: shamans
[5:22:56] plutotko: hls/lsd in mop classic
[5:22:58] Zacaree55: Resto shaamns
[5:22:58] ExpiryTV: @dontdv8 it’s season 8 in WOTLK right now, last phase.

[5:24:21] honest_abey: will cata be worth it to play?'
[5:24:29] BalancePK_: should i hit rogue/ ww or enhance
[5:24:32] kebobmeister: i played triple dps in cata, was so much fun
[5:24:34] Yanzoh: I agree, cata is terrible
[5:24:40] prolyphicttv: in MoP yeah
[5:24:40] Shablagoosh: popping a stampeeed man
[5:24:46] Yanzoh: MoP was great pvp
[5:24:49] ably: @BalancePK_ enhance is the worst but you look cooler if u win with it

[5:26:16] FrostmagicED: no one had it because heroic firelands was hard
[5:26:20] Shablagoosh: yea hopefully if cata flops they will realize that and give us actual patch by patch for mop
