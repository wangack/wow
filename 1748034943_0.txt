[6:48:08] jxakari: @akari_________ eating a packet of chips is also bad for your health, and unless youre sitting at the end of the exhaust inhaling it then theres next to no harm. the stuff the batteries give off when burning is far more toxic and it burns for months and months
[6:48:11] Gruzbug: took my brother 41 minutes and cost him $19 dollars to charge up his EV truck and it added 96 miles to his range... not worth it
