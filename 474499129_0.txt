I mean, we buy the same ass fridge from China... that makes drinks cold and ice for free so why the ARTIFICIAL scarcity of ice in EU? Thx your friend from USA

[5:22:25] dium: someone say roll mage
[5:22:26] dium: ”Method” is a professional raiding guild in the popular MMORPG “World of Warcraft”. Under the guidance of guild master Scott “Sco” McMillan the guild has come to be revered by many as the most accomplished guild of all time with several noteworthy achievements under its belt such as multiple world firsts, high ranking PvP teams and losing the Classic 60 race to a bald Maltese gnome.
[5:22:35] FinalPantasy: lmao

[5:24:12] Nightbot: Current time in Las Vegas/NV: August 30th 2019, 4:13:01 pm PDT GMT-07:00
[5:24:46] VillainHZ: Best comp I've seen is 2 heals for a tank to make massive pulls, and then 2 mages to aoe everything down. It saves time and eliminates the need to have to kite
[5:24:48] CorpusDelecti13: He was 10 man for hours earlier maybe it split up
[5:25:35] Kult4s: @jakenbakelive whats the addons that shows your energy?
[5:25:35] BolerN__: are you playing at a cyber cafe?

[5:30:02] shisu1_69: Whats your ping when youre in japan?
[5:30:20] VillainHZ: I was watching the 4 mage group yesterday and they would put down blizzards and miss some of the mobs draining their mana and wasting time. The other group I saw that had a tank to make the pulls was a bit more efficient

[5:33:01] mrcizzo: Do you think Asmon would trade all his viewers if it meant 1 viewer = 1 hair follicle?
[5:33:03] VillainHZ: 4 mages is obviously very effective, but In terms of the most efficient its better to have 1 tank keeping all targets stationary and then the mages blast them down since they don't have to waste time kiting
