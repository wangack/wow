[2:30:42] Vesidian: i will say, watching you has given me a idea of wtf to do in mythics, cause i had no idea.
[2:30:43] aleck1776: rip
[2:30:55] xHukk: you cleared 1 tree
[2:31:04] Zinnthos: tyrannical too stressful
[2:31:09] Horribelle: The trees explode, leaving one up kills everyone.
[2:31:13] Matosere: the bosses frontal clears tree u should try to clear as many as u can
[2:31:20] Jewishraver: @Vesidian i watch towel to learn the tank routes he takes and how the bosses work from a tank pov
[2:31:21] xHukk: with the big circle, gotta get all the trees
[2:31:24] ElmSpace: you cleave 4 with the boss cleave.
[2:31:34] Matosere: @Horribelle not true but does alot of damage yes.
[2:32:08] JD_Rieku: just stay central and face outside

[2:35:20] ElmSpace: you can always get 4 if you take 2 steps back then turn the boss on the 2 that spawn in the middle with some on the outside.
[2:35:23] Dcarter: Love it
[2:36:24] AlphasaurusRexx: removing 2 affixes and not replacing with anything just makes the rotation have more shitty combination of affixes. makes being a healer shitty half the week.
[2:36:38] pattythepaladin: Does prot feel good now? I was not a fan at the beginning of the xpac
[2:36:45] darkkilla1: i am hoping they nerf gnoll aids to the ground
[2:36:46] Zinnthos: Brackenhide will be cursed
[2:37:05] Zinnthos: neltharus might be fun
[2:37:06] darkkilla1: bursting grevious in brackenhide.. insta rip key
[2:37:17] chriswrites: i think its strongly suggested it will be underrot and shrine of storms @Towelliee
[2:37:21] Zinnthos: i think halls will be okay. just long
[2:37:21] jarilrpg: the next season's DF keys all feel like they are going to be near 40 minute keys
[2:37:28] instant_savage: legacy of tryr will be an easier one
[2:37:37] alb1nn0: underrot is fun
[2:37:44] Zinnthos: legacy of tyr  i think will be cursed.
[2:37:58] warrenny: @chriswrites Underrot is a toxic shithole
[2:38:16] Zinnthos: some real annoying mobs there
[2:38:19] abracka_: anyone else notice with the darkmoon harlequin's set that your head gets cut off with the helm? it's more noticeable on a blood elf / female human
[2:38:21] jarilrpg: that infinite trash with the stacking debuff on fort is going to be fun
[2:38:22] Mhyrol: Cata dungs on M+
[2:38:23] darkkilla1: season 2 is gonna be the season of dungeon nerfings
[2:38:44] Zinnthos: i think the new dungeons are fine until you add affixes
[2:39:01] darkkilla1: SBG is the most run m+ by far
[2:39:02] Carahail: @Zinnthos same
[2:39:14] KitamaruTV: SBG easily

[2:42:38] Alienfromger: i need new game mood
[2:43:00] pattythepaladin: Thoughts on Diablo 4 not having a paladin/crusader class?
[2:43:33] AlphasaurusRexx: @darkkilla1 there are a couple weeks that are easy healer weeks. when they removed the two affixes for this season it really made the combos suck ass for healers
[2:43:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: d3 didnt have a paladin crusader at launch either, it will eventually
[2:44:02] 91Niki: I'm turning 32 in March, feels old man ijpSAD
[2:44:06] pattythepaladin: Was crusader not at launch? I can't remember 12 years ago xD

[2:44:48] theSalute: @91Niki nahhhh not old, I just turned 32 in feb heu heu

[2:51:31] strobe_light10: Gives a 20% damage increase vs 25% crit
[2:51:33] 91Niki: Seeing it is the light classes that are missing. I am thinking a light DLC towCopium Giving us monk and crusader

[2:54:20] Hebrew_Hammer112: SBG just very much lacking in loot compared to other 2
[2:54:38] darkkilla1: depends on class
[2:54:54] warrenny: Sbg also easiest funny that

[3:18:58] S1thman: hes dieing
[3:19:02] darkkilla1: scratching his balls
[3:19:06] S1thman: forgot hes only supposed to feign death
[3:19:31] darkkilla1: huntards are always squishy though
[3:19:33] ItsXolten: Yea their squishy af
[3:19:37] Cheapesttactics1: They only have turtle right?
[3:19:37] xJyzzusx: cause they are
[3:19:37] REALPolarbeezy: minimal defenses
[3:19:38] paulson14: as a MM hunter they re badly
[3:19:44] Cello_73: we are very squishy
[3:19:57] Foretoldlegends: Also with max stack Bugeoning Seed and Guardian of Ursoc, I managed to hit 880k hp at the moment. I feel before phase 2 (Only 402 Ilvl), I could potentially hit 1mil hp with that combination.
[3:20:01] Tendeyaloran: Hunters don't have reliable DR outside of turtle no?
[3:20:01] Cello_73: low survivability for higher keys
[3:20:04] paulson14: usually they make it up in dmg but this hunter isn't that great
[3:20:18] Cello_73: long cd's for them @Tendeyaloran
[3:20:26] Cello_73: so yea can use them but once a fight
[3:20:36] OneHittaGaming: that hunter sux
[3:20:44] ItsXolten: He should be living on a 19 tbh
[3:20:51] OneHittaGaming: should be top dmg
[3:21:02] darkkilla1: how is the hunter the lowest dps on this fight
[3:21:05] S1thman: i love my fury warrior but i prefer my demolock

[3:21:45] strobe_light10: why are servers going down?
[3:21:49] pryse__: Maintenance on a Thursday??
[3:21:52] t_train_va: Wasn't the hunter the one freaking out at the beginning?
[3:21:52] Finni2011: towBluewing towBlue towFire1 towFire2
[3:21:59] Foretoldlegends: One hour maintenance.
[3:22:05] thetorque162: trading post issues likely
[3:22:06] lorddrekken: lorddrekken subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Rough week for healers with grievous and thundering
[3:22:08] Mecabeast: Probably fix for trade post issues
[3:22:09] Foretoldlegends: I think people said the trading post bugged again.
[3:22:10] t_train_va: Didn't you say he needed to chill out
[3:22:11] strobe_light10: he was asking everyone if they had flasks and shit
[3:22:13] looniebinn: speedyBread
[3:22:13] OneHittaGaming: i feel like the servers are down more then they are up these days lol
[3:22:14] ItsXolten: As a hunter you always save defensives for intermission
[3:22:15] t_train_va: I was getting on call
[3:22:17] strobe_light10: and then proceeded to die every pull
[3:22:17] S1thman: this is like the second week in a row they did maintence on a thursday
[3:22:23] t_train_va: Maybe something about flasks, etc.
[3:22:24] juicefermilk: @thetorque162 was gonna say the same thing lol
[3:22:30] Finni2011: maybe some hotfixes?
[3:22:32] Nezbane: yea im not doing mythics on my healer this week
[3:22:34] wavecrasher917: are you playing pathfinder music ?
[3:22:56] pryse__: They are doing so much maintenance these last few months. I don't remember them doing it so often in other expansions
[3:22:59] Foretoldlegends: Also I think Alge'thar Academy has another bug. The green puddle used to avoid taking the stacks from adds disappears before the adds spawn. So that's not helping either.
[3:22:59] ItsXolten: @Finni2011 They don't do maintenance for hotfixes
[3:23:05] Tendeyaloran: I wonder what hotfixs are being applied that require servers to be down

[3:54:32] chriswrites: yup. people are expecting some insane m+ changes like this expansion's plans arenot already laid out
[3:54:55] Tendeyaloran: it'd be fun to have a small chance to only have fort/tyr and the seasonal affix on high keys

[3:55:16] reggiepowa: I dont think any dungeon was created with affixes in mind, they made dungeons then just slapped the same old affixes on them
[3:55:19] Masqerader: i can't wait for hard pass Brackenhide
[3:55:22] Fortvila: I hope the powercreep makes m+ just a little easier
[3:55:27] Heero_Effect: People would freak if they delayed 10.1 more haha

[3:57:18] doogs44: @Towelliee I think  that the affixes were designed to add spice so running the same instances all xpac didnt get stale.  With the seasonal instance pool they added this xpac i dont think affixes have a place anymore.

[3:57:42] UltraKSlaya: they should make solo dungeons
[3:57:51] SundanceC: You can run 2s, get the gear and the valor  :)
[3:58:05] bgumbrella129: some affixes favor 1-2 classes makes half the player base play meta classes
[3:58:09] PvtHudson093: thats another thing there needs to be more concentrated essences dropping
[3:58:12] UltraKSlaya: 10-15 min to get a group sometimes lol
[3:58:17] SundanceC: Capped though
[3:58:17] GingerGambit: It was interesting making thundering similar to a Raz mechanic but fell flat
[3:58:26] SundanceC: Cant get 2400 on 2s
[3:58:31] Nezbane: yea some of the affix combos make m+ so unfun and painful (as a healer)

[3:58:37] PvtHudson093: 1 essence per run is not enough
[3:58:38] Snabido: Could some of the season affixes we've had so far join the rotation?
[3:58:52] doogs44: Valor issue needs to be adjusted too.  you should get more valor the higher the key
[3:59:11] Mecabeast: Also wish valor scaled on key level cause some of us need like 3k+ valor but just don't have the time to do more than like 3 keys a day
[3:59:20] Exodeo_: What about those like me that can't be bothered? ;p
[3:59:48] reggiepowa: eranog gear is the same gear every boss but the last 2 had in shadowlands
[3:59:52] Fortvila: and it was nice

[4:00:05] GingerGambit: Aren’t 15s harder than last season?
[4:00:09] UltraKSlaya: why punch down on Casuals...
[4:00:11] SundanceC: Bricked 3 +10s AV last night..  but..  thats the PUG life.
[4:00:19] abracka_: they def are
[4:00:30] PvtHudson093: its 16/18/20 keys people run, no one wants ro run 17/19 keys because they are harder but still reward the same vault as a 16/18
[4:00:42] jarilrpg: they are, they increased the scaling after +10
[4:01:06] Pooshs: World of Dungeoncraft
[4:01:15] UltraKSlaya: hmm,I hate professions though lol
[4:01:16] doogs44: Raiding also needs to have an item upgrade path with valor.
[4:01:24] Guffels: heroic gear is the worst part of gearing, my entire guild was 410 before we killed heroic raz
[4:01:32] Masqerader: idk how many keys were completed during the first season of SL S1, but DF 1 19,000,000 keys have been completed in time already. Now the question, what are the 15/16 compeletion rate

[4:01:41] Tendeyaloran: I'm wondering if we will see less ilvl increase in M+ gear than in raiding gear as the xpac goes on
[4:01:43] thespoonzilla: If you're 395 or so and want to get 405+ running a heroic and getting funneled is still the fastest way to gear
[4:01:46] ottavianni: m+ the new grind
[4:01:53] SpilledMelk: Haven't played wow in forever, but is all gear epic now? Like is there no green or blue gear?
[4:01:55] thespoonzilla: vault is still only 1 slot a week, its painfully slow
[4:01:59] thespoonzilla: same with crafting
[4:02:09] SundanceC: Easier to get a m,uthic piece and farm the valor.
[4:02:09] Heero_Effect: Servers are up
[4:02:09] PvtHudson093: more essences need to drop
[4:02:32] Dcarter: I mean if they made the orbs account bound that’d fix a lot
[4:02:34] faulen: those are alts though, right?
[4:02:35] PotbellyGoat: I'm coming back patch 10.2 to gear up before next expansion lol

[4:02:54] Lazugo: Make 20s give 3 primal focuses
[4:02:57] robbo1010: you think they'll make them account wide?
[4:03:21] PvtHudson093: really could do with a chance of an extra orb dropping as they key level gets higher
[4:03:37] SundanceC: and make those thing account bound
[4:03:56] Warblade23: Make vault 1 3,5. 8 per week is just too many
[4:04:17] Mecabeast: Also would like to have a conversion of like 10 primal focus to 1 concentrated primal focus
[4:04:18] Moobot: Make sure to tune in for Early Beta Access weekend Diablothon! Also June release for our annual SUBATHON.
[4:04:20] darkkilla1: kill kel'thas in magisters is the easiest one
[4:04:22] abracka_: send yourself 10 crafting orders from a alt. i just send my JC 10 orders for draconic vials
[4:04:34] warrenny: @warblade23 If its too much dont do 8
[4:04:34] Evenuno: Darkmoon
[4:04:52] kineticdh: gotta have warmode on for that wq
[4:04:55] Lintgamer: thats what he said
[4:04:55] PvtHudson093: 1 4 7
[4:04:58] Lintgamer: read the sentence :D
[4:05:01] jarilrpg: you always get 50 tokens for a pvp world quest
[4:05:18] darkkilla1: tank some 2s and do them in 5 mins
[4:05:20] Evenuno: Lauderdale style
[4:05:33] WeE_wOo_WhEn: I don't know about the "do less to get the same", I think they need to think how can they make pug groups in m+ an enjoyable experience
[4:05:53] WeE_wOo_WhEn: if we enjoy running the mythics the number or runs won't matter, they'll just accrue
[4:05:54] Davedaman26: I got a +5 Temple SeemsGood
[4:06:34] abracka_: o/
[4:06:41] Tendeyaloran: no meowdy
[4:06:43] Heero_Effect: sex them
[4:06:47] Lonely_piggy_: What's your io rating?
[4:07:19] Naturalbeef: Maybe they can have dual M+ systems. 1 with affixes and 1 without
[4:07:24] PixieFirefly: PixieFirefly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:07:27] im_capy: Hows Lulas raid been going

[4:07:47] Dcarter: But I’m a masochist
[4:07:51] doogs44: Disable the chat
[4:07:56] Dcarter: I embrace the pain
[4:08:06] faulen: pug score vs. premade score?
[4:08:28] UltraKSlaya: they should make mythic plus scaleable like Torghast was
[4:08:34] Exodeo_: all the affixes..
[4:08:37] zenedar87: Need some more positive affixes
[4:08:42] EdgeOfTwilight: the one downside to that is it takes time and not everyone likes to wait
[4:08:42] Tendeyaloran: the most frustrating thing for me is getting everyone to the instance Kappa
[4:08:43] Warblade23: bring back the bomswandi affix. loved that
[4:08:49] reggiepowa: I think most people are fine with tyr/fort, it's the other affixes that are screwing the dungeons
[4:09:04] rbgdev: I’ve found the most frustrating part of m+ is the people not the game
[4:09:09] SpilledMelk: Running mythic + for zero drops constantly seems like a blast. So rewarding...
[4:09:10] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || This boss is a pushover 😅 #diablo youtu.be/7B0Ueb8SEH4
[4:09:21] Naturalbeef: It would be so much easier to tune
[4:09:30] SundanceC: Get rid of Tyrannical and Fortified and just have the affixes
[4:09:38] Rhun0z: @Towelliee so true
[4:09:56] BoogiePonderosa: the Dungeon Master
[4:09:56] Dcarter: Oh for sure @spilledmelk this game could benefit from a token system
[4:10:00] Evenuno: Jesus himself
[4:10:07] Dcarter: Why it doesn’t have one fucking blows my mind
[4:10:12] Lonely_piggy_: that was me sorry :)
[4:10:16] Foretoldlegends: That was Majordomo. The little text bubble didn't pop up.
[4:10:22] PvtHudson093: fuck storming
[4:10:24] kodder12: sanguine aint that bad
[4:10:25] Rhun0z: tyra and forti more than enough .D
[4:10:26] Tendeyaloran: quaking can die in a fire
[4:10:27] kineticdh: you likenecrotic more than sanguine
[4:10:28] SpilledMelk: Yeah, I agree d
[4:10:34] Zigra1: as a healer now. i hate the silence quaking does
[4:10:38] Dcarter: Imagine running a dungeon 37 straight times and not even seeing an item couldn’t be me
[4:10:42] Dcarter: Oh wait….
[4:10:47] kodder12: But quaking is toxic as hell
[4:10:51] SpilledMelk: Tokens in wrath was nice
[4:10:51] itsjustin_ow: Bring back necrotic!
[4:11:05] kodder12: and explosives is the worst
[4:11:22] N3llee: I stopped playing 3 weeks ago but I just got tired of spending 45 mins looking for group for any key and then people leaving the first wipe or issue the group has. At the time my M+ score was 2400
[4:11:32] WeE_wOo_WhEn: would some form of negative to leaving the group before completion be a good idea? At the moment only the key holder losses for negative behaviour.
[4:12:30] faulen: I wish the affix made you more powerful. Stand in the thundering swirls, gain a haste buff
[4:12:48] WeE_wOo_WhEn: Sir_Bastion_VIII subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:12:49] faulen: clear your mark get a crit buff
[4:12:51] SpilledMelk: Wish they would bring back a Torghast style area that had actual rewards. It was a very good idea but poorly implemented
[4:15:21] captain_khyzan: captain_khyzan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months!

[4:17:38] UltraKSlaya: or rifts in d3
[4:17:41] warrenny: Player agency overused complaint

[4:17:45] kineticdh: just run another and reroll it
[4:17:49] strobe_light10: They should let you pick key level and dungeon but have the affixes random roll to the key instead of week to week.
[4:18:06] PvtHudson093: remember when we could destory the key and get another one at then end of a dundeon
[4:18:17] PokerFaceMoose: a lot of people have limited time and waiting for M+s suck
[4:18:33] outbreak2005: @strobe_light10 That or let you pick the affixes and your rating is based on the affixes
[4:19:04] baaronthemonk: preach it
[4:19:06] zilzihan: BURN IT !

[4:19:20] shimwood: Next expansion: World of Warcraft Deforestation
[4:19:21] killerteapotsftw: trees are an affix :D

[4:19:28] gwar234: no way thats blizzes fav mechanic not being bale to see
[4:19:29] 91Niki: Beautiful trees need trimming too!

[4:20:58] Sayryn: Nothing was worse than the OG Sunken Temple.
[4:21:05] outbreak2005: HOV
[4:21:10] SpilledMelk: Ok, thanks
[4:21:16] Glynn11: would be a neat addition for wow to allow manipulating terrain/environment objects
[4:23:28] SpilledMelk: Sunken Temple was bad, but I hated Wailing Caverns the most. I was always lost
[4:23:49] Wulfgrym: this is WARCRAFT get some orc grunts and MOAR WORK those trees to the ground

[4:27:02] EmpathyLiveChat: Fair
[4:27:09] zoovthepally: Would like to be able to recover essences

[4:27:14] Tendeyaloran: yo same
[4:27:24] Maydie6066: Crafting is great, but yeah if you missed your first.. say 5 point even you got fucked in the tree and lost out on the money race
[4:27:36] Maydie6066: also yeah public orders are just dead
[4:27:40] darkrowse21: is there anyway u can get more sparks for crafted gear then just questline
[4:27:51] Neekoliss: why not be able to respec craft talents once per week?
[4:27:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having to use alts to give yourself orders to fill....that will make you go blind LUL
[4:28:00] Tendeyaloran: I rushed crafting and didn't know that things was locked behind points
[4:28:01] Sayryn: Pull the ripcord
[4:28:01] paulson14: @darkrowse21 they randomly drop
[4:28:03] warrenny: @darkrowse21 Drops after it
[4:28:10] strobe_light10: it's because everyone wants 45% chance at r5 proc for 5k tip
[4:28:16] strobe_light10: it's horse shit how fucking cheap people are
[4:29:18] Neekoliss: oh no free money

[5:43:34] cmitchell042092: I don’t do m+ but I know how annoying the rp is for someone doing speed runs through a dungeon
[5:44:03] AlphasaurusRexx: what was the dungeon last expansion with the 5 minutes of flying from platform to platform
[5:44:06] Molvonos: They didn't even remove the rp, they just made Skovald snort some crack and hustle in faster.
[5:44:23] Deadcon13: Professions are the only game changing thing they added to DF

[5:44:59] AlphasaurusRexx: @Molvonos nah they removed his first couple sentences of dialogue. he hustles in now and says his last piece
[5:45:34] Molvonos: Did they?  It's not even noticeable, lol
[5:45:40] Foretoldlegends: Bruh. I had a shaman in a m+ almost brick a +10 because he kept spamming earth elemental and stealing tank aggro.
[5:46:00] Deadcon13: If there is no embellishment the odds of getting 418 is much higher. If you were making an embellished item, probably better to use r3 alloy
[5:46:14] AlphasaurusRexx: @Foretoldlegends i assure you that was not the reason for almost bricking
[5:46:32] smashwow: flavor pocket
[5:46:37] AlphasaurusRexx: @Molvonos its really not lol. still have to get up there with 10 minutes left on timer pretty much
[5:46:38] smashwow: always flavor pocket
[5:46:47] Molvonos: Uh, if an Earth Ele was 'stealing' aggro in your M+ from a tank, it wasn't the shaman.
[5:47:04] tommy_thick: gonna take 2
[5:47:06] wigglinjigglin: no way his proc is big enough to jump a full rank is it?
[5:47:08] Deadcon13: Yep, I'd gamble with the r2 alloy for sure
[5:47:23] stabzmcgeee: i swear anything ive had crafted the last 3 weeks have all 1 shot
[5:47:24] wigglinjigglin: from 3 to 5?

[5:47:40] Tooyoo: yeah you can go 3 to 5 with inspiration
[5:47:46] wigglinjigglin: LOL, my lariat took 12 tries to r5
[5:47:48] Tooyoo: the crafting system is kinda not tuned correctly
[5:47:49] wigglinjigglin: grats
[5:47:50] smashwow: life finds a way
[5:47:50] stabzmcgeee: @wigglinjigglin thats not how it works
[5:47:58] wmadsen: Very nice!
[5:48:12] james_bah: when could we see 10.0.7 announcement towel
[5:48:32] Rudric_Ice: SUBprise
[5:48:35] thewolfmans: nope
[5:48:37] Molvonos: You cannot, correct
[5:48:38] Tooyoo: correct, you cant catalyze crafted gear
[5:48:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: No crafted gear in the catalyst
[5:48:58] Molvonos: At last not yet.  Who knows if Blizz will add the tech in 10.8 or 9.
[5:49:11] wigglinjigglin: @stabzmcgeee i understand how it works, you have a skill then inspiration has a x% chance to add Y amount of skill, then your total skill determines rank. I dont understand why he would ask to request only r3 when he had a chance at proc r5. Wouldnt it mean a guarantee r4 in the first place?
[5:50:15] stabzmcgeee: @wigglinjigglin oh im with you now,, yes it shouldve been min rank 4,,, no idea why the crafter would ask for 3
[5:50:54] wigglinjigglin: def seemed suspect to only request 3 and just steal the 10k gold lol.
[5:51:22] chickdrummer88: Good morning you heckin nerds
[5:51:56] Yagr6: LUL
[5:52:05] outbreak2005: For 392? lol
[5:52:12] OneHittaGaming: most the time its 5k
[5:52:17] PvtHudson093: he isnt
[5:52:20] reggiepowa: by charging 25k to people who dont know better lol
[5:52:25] drewetling: i will pay you tuesday for a cheeseburger today
[5:52:29] outbreak2005: Dont you have guildies that can make that lol
[5:52:36] Foretoldlegends: You need to realize that the mettle to craft the item to help raise inspiration is a little on the low side at the moment. If they increase the sheer amount of mettle we can get in game, I think the commission prices will drop.
[5:52:51] Deadcon13: He might have used his orb to skill it up past r3 into r4 to then inspire it to r5
[5:53:34] Deadcon13: illustrious insight^

[5:54:08] Foretoldlegends: Orbs and inspiration isn't cheap at the moment. Probably come near the end of the expansion, they'll overload us on it and professions will feel like nothing as money makers.
[5:56:50] barrowzz: Person on sargeras alli just charge mats+tip for lariat and that was like well over a month ago I knew like 10-12 people that all went to that person and tipped minimum 2-5k each craft/recraft. Not part of the crafting mafia as maximum put it last night lol 😂
