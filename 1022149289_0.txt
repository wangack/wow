[1:38:40] Slitze: sup bro
[1:38:52] Aidler: @ElPolloBatman as EP i'd say for everything
[1:38:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: They introduced mtx when ghostcrawler was the lead dev of wow
[1:38:57] Alienfromger: and probably very casual friendly too
[1:39:02] dreioo: @ColdChillXI y'all want mouse pointer skins?
[1:39:10] Trawkey: what mtx does new world have?

[1:40:16] Slitze: bastards
[1:40:21] LT_Biscuit: yes they clarified
[1:40:22] NexusOps: I think Riot MMO is well positioned for MTX though. Just think about all the skins they are selling for the champs right now in their MOBA. I mean, Ahri fans are going to lose their collective minds over some skimpy outfits.
[1:40:25] Luthercorpz: sayeedLeft sayeedMid sayeedRight
[1:40:25] Ziyololx: Amazon is making it, are people suprised? lol
[1:40:25] Reap14: Well lets face it. Thats a pretty stupid thing to announce at all.
[1:40:27] ColdChillXI: I dont mind paying for cosmetics as long as there are free options that arent shit
[1:40:36] Trawkey: Lol what did ppl expect? Its a boxpriced game. Ofc its gonna have a shop...
[1:40:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: fuck em for adding boosts
[1:40:43] Boccardo316: Riot already has a stablished fan base, so it is easier for them to have mtx
[1:40:51] dreioo: because fuck em
[1:40:54] Slitze: eso got me to quit wow
[1:40:55] Reap14: Why would I want to start a brand new mmo that has boosts available from day one?
[1:41:02] Reap14: That absolute garbage
[1:41:07] Alienfromger: its b2p so they need something for monetization
[1:41:08] Boccardo316: Although Legend of Runeterra didnt go to well, but valorant and lol are sucessful
[1:41:09] dreioo: @Slitze not a bad way to go
[1:41:16] mrjonboy: The store isn't an issues as such, it's the fact that they are putting in boosts and other p2w stuff in there
[1:41:16] Luthercorpz: @Reap14 bouseCash bouseCash bouseCash bouseCash bouseCash bouseCash
[1:41:17] Slitze: @dreioo yep
[1:41:24] Slitze: more shit to do
[1:41:33] Shrenko: EXP boost in ESO is fine because of CP lvls
[1:41:41] belfastcl: you get those boosts in ESO for free in the daily rewards, and you can buy them from players that craft them
[1:41:49] belfastcl: the more powerful ones are crafted
[1:41:49] ColdChillXI: havent touched gw2 since launch year LUL
[1:41:50] Ribastur0075: solo beta
[1:41:51] EscapePlan01: why would you start a game that you know will have boosts and trading skills boosts in, at some undetermined time. biggest red flag ever.
[1:41:53] Slitze: it's like almost a brand new mmo  :D
[1:42:11] dreioo: @Slitze yeah I enjoy the exploration and it feeling like an actual RPG and not a rush for currencies. What class are you maining?
[1:42:25] Slitze: yep all the things i'd like for wow
[1:42:34] Trawkey: Cosmetics are ok. Xp boosts are meeh
[1:42:41] Slitze: stam necro
[1:42:43] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee I hard triggered a Candy in his stream this morning when I told him that he should not worry about leveling and just get the boost on Tuesday. I wish I had recorded it.
[1:42:43] Rudric_Ice: micro transactions are fine if it's a F2p game and when it's not p2w
[1:42:44] EscapePlan01: no real boosts for gw2, just cosmetics and small QOL stuff
[1:42:49] GCnT: In SWOTOR if you subscribe you level faster than the people who are free to play! I think that the same will be for New World
[1:42:53] dreioo: @Slitze sweet. Enjoy!

[1:46:05] idenkaz_: magemyway subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:46:08] Boccardo316: Boost in wow is fine I think, the game has been out for so long and people play so many alts
[1:46:22] Shamwise: what game?
[1:46:22] lithium364: please no locked bagspace for money
[1:46:44] mrjonboy: honestly thats why i prefer sub and no shop
[1:46:48] Bombayshow: remember they made wow with less than 30 people
[1:46:50] Bombayshow: LUL
[1:47:00] Aphro_Samurai: @lithium364 i hate that
[1:47:04] Slitze: you pay 15 bucks to play the extent of the game kind of like u do  wow
[1:47:11] Clicklesly: Well yeah, game impacting stuff would obviously sell better ^^
[1:47:12] othraerir: maybe only open boosts when you have a max lvl char?
[1:47:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: wow classic
[1:47:15] biirrd: you need to have a stream of income every month now in game development to be big
[1:47:17] lithium364: what if the ingame shop is linked to prime video and you have to buy movies for ingame items KEKW
[1:47:17] belfastcl: i wouldn't mind if the boosts also came as part of an optional sub
[1:47:25] Slitze: pretty much the same model as wow
[1:47:32] MrBullShietTho: i like the ffxiv store cuz all the money that u spent is going to dev team, not Square Enix
[1:47:33] Shrenko: Bless :)
[1:47:48] Waspire: they cant survive without one
[1:47:49] dreioo: MTX can suck it :)
[1:47:50] ElPolloBatman: i think the main reason they're going for xp boosts is because the playerbase drops significantly after a month or three. so that's their window to get plenty of players the chance to complete some t4 sets, maybe even t5 if said raids are open
[1:48:02] mmo_kenna_: I've decided to play ESO Blackwood instead of going back down the TBC rabbit hole 😄
[1:48:04] LawnSpeaker: @othraerir you mean close boosts when you have a max level character?
[1:48:06] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: wow classic vanilla has no p2w @Towelliee
[1:48:09] Treir44: it just sucks when wows cash shop just goes to activision

[1:48:35] Boccardo316: That’s the advantage of Riot for their mmo, people love their cosmetics
[1:48:36] Slitze: kinder cooler
[1:48:38] othraerir: yeah @LawnSpeaker make them only available on an account once you've maxed a char

[1:50:02] Treir44: does that make it okay though
[1:50:05] Kriven: yeah sadly swtor needs the cash shop to survive but it also is the driving focus and its clear that comes first over content
[1:50:09] Galagan1: There are plenty of other games to play though :D
[1:50:11] KillaPr0: i am looking forward to playing new world
[1:50:23] flebbooo: KEKW

[1:52:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Kappa
[1:52:13] LawnSpeaker: Blizzard should be focusing on how to monetise classic for the long term... like selling a "progression pass" for future progression servers and actually add content to each patch
[1:52:15] Reap14: I love how we have gone from games are dying to now the entire genre is dying
[1:52:25] SonofHorus82: @SleepyWolfZzz it's most likely to take a snap shot of the game for progressing to the new classic servers.

[2:11:16] Moobot: @ghponken Towelliee's Plater Addon Profile - https://wago.io/1ZozQnKxj
[2:11:16] Collected1: the problem for him is he needs to either be all in or nothing. he can't be in that casual balance place.
[2:11:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: times change
[2:11:22] SonofHorus82: @neverbornlucky if you get the classic PTR you can see it all. Pre-Patch is on the PTR right now.
[2:11:28] SlayerLightStorm: People just need to get off their high horse. They'll get humbled.
[2:11:30] DeleldurTV: Kungen has bipolar disorder. That's what happened.
[2:11:41] neverbornlucky: swifty should come to azuresong lol balance
[2:11:42] bruhSit_farmer: mental health isnt real bro, stop the count (kappa)
[2:11:50] flebbooo: FeelsBadMan
[2:11:51] Shrenko: bipolar sucks
[2:11:52] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: stop the count!!!
[2:11:55] Bombayshow: probably someone told him wow was the problem
[2:11:57] Bombayshow: LUL
[2:11:59] BRUTALIT0PS: As someone with issues, I can confirm. If you're having a bad day or something, it can make you completely incapable of operating as human being
[2:12:06] IIINUCLEAR: Do you think the azure whelpling will be available when TBC launches?
[2:12:08] falldrgn: OR Kungen is in 11.0 and has soloed everything so far.
[2:12:11] Fhirn: its good that its being recognised more these days, its not a ''joke'' anymore
[2:12:30] Defenzor: Defenzor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 113 months! Back drop looking nice.
[2:12:41] SlayerLightStorm: @BRUTALIT0PS Exactly. Stress gets to me big time on a few days.

[2:13:03] Collected1: reeeee
[2:13:04] wreckshoptv: those furries respawn fast :P

[2:14:18] belfastcl: the hardest thing for him, at least it seems that way, is playing wow just casually
[2:14:18] bruhSit_farmer: how you do it towell, how you so consistent and brush off your own stuff ??
[2:15:19] Redpandalol: @towelliee when he revives nihilum it comes off as a grift to cash in on subs and donos
[2:15:24] CrusaderNero: Kungen is cool. Hope hes well
[2:15:24] Fhirn: you have a good heart @Towelliee
[2:15:56] CrusaderNero: I got Lightforge Spaulders yesterday in UBRS on my 55 paladin. So stoked about that lol
[2:16:01] Ldysansa: It never ceases to amaze me how people do not realize just how much work goes into streaming. It's not as easy as it appears to be.
[2:16:25] bruhSit_farmer: truth yea i learned to live with my inner demons, part of the personality
[2:16:27] MOLAR305: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[2:16:32] Hayquel: that is very fortunate
[2:16:41] Exusprime: How can u say he has good hear while murdering these Furblogs WutFace
[2:16:45] Collected1: we lost one of our own to mental health last year so be kind. you never know what someone is dealing with.
[2:16:49] MOLAR305: or as my cuban parents say, lo que no Mata engorda
[2:16:49] onybear: People are individuals and handle things different from person to person
[2:16:54] bruhSit_farmer: its mainly learning how to deal with it, probably learnt early and its second nature
[2:17:03] 210Crawler: we live and we learn
[2:17:07] LSBreed: you mean it's possible to learn and grow as a person towPog
[2:17:17] mulletrocker11358: man.. ret pally or prot pally when p[repatch drops...
[2:17:18] bruhSit_farmer: life wouldnt be shit w/o the demons lets be honest
[2:17:21] Exodeo_: My own issue is social anxiety, twitch has been a great way for me to learn to cope
[2:17:24] KillaPr0: it effects your judgement
[2:17:27] MattMightGame: Thats normal tho. Mental health is really just becoming a normal and we're accepting it. Its still not very well understood or accepted by most. I feel the gaming / streaming community understands it more than the average person.
[2:17:45] Wildside1177: Bipolar disease is almost entirely due to chemical imbalance in the brain. If Kung gets the correct medication and mental tools he can return for sure IMO. But I am not a doctor.
[2:17:50] Waspire: cleave  you silly warrior!!  hehe
[2:17:50] Aidler: I never had any mental issues. don't know how that feels naguuraMonkaS
[2:18:06] Waspire: 2+ = cleave
[2:18:09] Collected1: Wildside1177 : he's had some complications
[2:18:19] MOLAR305: I only suffer from the occasional bout of imposter syndrome
[2:18:20] flebbooo: KEKW
[2:18:22] Alienfromger: @Aidler you think you do but you dont Kappa
[2:18:23] Sollice: SPODERS AND SNAKEZ
[2:18:24] BRUTALIT0PS: One of my friends used to make fun of my panic disorder and kept saying it was in my head until he had one himself. He called me and apologized.
[2:18:26] NexusOps: same here
[2:18:28] bruhSit_farmer: SHADOWLANDS is my greatest fear, 9.3 ?!?!?

[2:18:52] TheBeardedAussie: spiders are cute
[2:18:52] Collected1: did we ever get clarification about that email being fake or real?
[2:18:56] Eriewst: There was a dude in one of my old guilds that bred Tarantulas. F that
[2:18:59] flebbooo: wasps are the worst
[2:19:00] Aravarth: I mean they got 8 legs, 3239841 eyes
[2:19:01] Hayquel: Thank god my country doesn't really have spiders
[2:19:01] bruhSit_farmer: or shadwoalnds
[2:19:01] Aquadriel: and chanclas
[2:19:05] DrakhanGaming: I dont really understand the whole Dr. K show because streamers obviously cant say everything on their mind because everyone is watching them
[2:19:07] Alienfromger: fears are mental issues too
[2:19:10] rfnatboy: blargBoo
[2:19:11] Notsure770: Spiders that jump and wasps...
[2:19:11] BRUTALIT0PS: Mine is wasps and snakes
[2:19:13] Aidler: clowns are ok. only spiders for me...
[2:19:14] Zettabyte: Clown vs Easter Bunny mobile game Kappa

[2:20:06] Aravarth: nod, MD in psychiatry
[2:20:20] Aquadriel: yeah
[2:20:23] CrusaderNero: @neverbornlucky neither Kappa
[2:20:25] Eriewst: how does his show not violate patient doctor confidentiality is beyond me
[2:20:25] Shrenko: Doctor K and Reckful conversation was heavy
[2:20:28] falldrgn: Bear your soull to us...
[2:20:30] MaxedLuck_: thats fair. he really is fantastic at what he does, being someone in the field... but yeah being private is totally a fair thing
[2:20:31] Aidler: streamer doctor = celebrity doctor... it's the same
[2:20:32] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: The streamers that go on there like to be transparent

[2:21:00] Armdel: a good chunk of their job seems to be to ask the right questions
[2:21:13] codedizle: yeah
[2:21:20] DrakhanGaming: I mean that is what I am trying to say, asmon for example, you could see he was masking a lot of things because he knew tons of people were watching him. Im not discrediting Dr. K, I just dont fully understand the point of the show.

[2:44:27] SpoonManes: weed makes me paranoid these days. i had to give it up
[2:44:36] Aravarth: @biiigfrank That's why when you're gambling, they tend to comp your drinks at casinos.
[2:44:40] Theconuk88: Drinking is bad on anything that you need inhibition for
[2:44:44] nerdtopia: they shoulda forced everyone to go to TBC
[2:44:47] Theconuk88: Or decent decision. Making skills
[2:44:48] nerdtopia: the fk is there to do in classic
[2:45:00] SeargentHartman: is it only classic cersvers that are getting merged, or is tbc servers getting merged as well?
[2:45:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: except dancing, drinking makes you better at dancing
[2:45:02] Theconuk88: Aka why I’ve been arrested twice for drinking and driving

[2:45:28] nerdtopia: it's been out for almost 3 years there's nothing left to do @SuperBrotendo
[2:45:30] Sir_KnightErrant: Casinos in the midwest provide free drinks as well. At least all the ones I have been to
[2:45:30] CrusaderNero: I really regret missing out on the whole classic experience at 60
[2:45:31] Aravarth: I mean, I know when I'm on a cruise ship or the couple times I go to Vegas, they comped drinks hard at the craps table.
[2:45:32] othraerir: more likely to spend if you're a bit drunk i guess?
[2:45:32] Theconuk88: I can’t take drunk either I get bored because my hammered ass can barely pay attention
[2:45:36] SpoonManes: @Bombayshow TF you live in a baseball stadium?

[2:46:35] Theconuk88: Strip clubs Jesus the amt of money spent blacked out in a strip club vegas the first time was 10k I think
[2:46:38] Gid86: Boost is still 35?

[2:46:50] igor93: @Gid86 dropped to 15
[2:46:52] Mecabeast: it's gonna get to a point where there's something starting during down time on one of the other games
[2:46:54] SlayerLightStorm: @Gid86 Went down to $15
[2:47:11] Waspire: im doing bolth  but only with a few char
[2:47:28] Sir_KnightErrant: I'm sure you talked about this a bunch, but what did you think about having boosts at launch of NW @Towelliee. Isn't crafting one of the pillars of the game?
[2:47:36] SpoonManes: bye cclassic when i get tbc
[2:47:45] BRUTALIT0PS: Clone is dropped to 15, not boost
[2:47:52] samune1: same
[2:47:54] kusosando: I'm trying to finish up leveling my classic warrior for TBC but wish I had spent the time on a shaman instead
[2:47:55] ghponken: is it worth starting lvling a new main now or just wait for boost
[2:47:57] razlive: if you're already fully geared what can u do in era though? i guess bg for fun but other than that
[2:47:58] Teldrin89: clone is now 15, right?
[2:47:59] MuttonChopins: better price than retail boosting
[2:48:07] wrec7: yeah i actually expected the boost to be more
[2:48:08] BRUTALIT0PS: @Teldrin89 Yes
[2:48:12] AnubiS1690: I will never give blizzard more than a 15$ sub. If they change that price, I’m gone.
[2:48:16] igor93: @Towelliee whens a good time to list stuff on this server my stuff wont sell LUL
[2:48:17] Waspire: at least the horde and  alliance will balance out  since each server  is 90% of each.
[2:48:17] Mecabeast: south
[2:48:19] uberhart: around lake north at tiger head, owl caves
[2:48:22] tangochief83: You can get an addon that shows you all the mineral nodes
[2:48:22] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: mankrik is big horde server
[2:48:24] Wildside1177: Demon area in the asouth
[2:48:29] AnubiS1690: I will also never pay for in game services. Ever
[2:48:35] D3m0nHunt3r666: go around the mountains and near the demons or giants
[2:48:36] BRUTALIT0PS: You can buy a boost and clone for less than a boost on retail, so I am not complaining
[2:48:38] Amarlian: $15 is more inline with blizzard pricing though
[2:48:43] Maruika: clone should be free and they can subsidize the 15 into the boost
[2:48:43] AveragePvp: @anubis1690 if you feel that way you should honestly just go imo
[2:48:44] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:48:47] Amarlian: just a little higher than you expect
[2:48:50] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: yea I play horde on mankrik
[2:48:50] ez_ak_spray: Blizzard is money hungry grubs
[2:49:02] Mecabeast: you'll need a group tho bc elite giants in the south
[2:49:05] Aravarth: If a clone was $35, I'd get zero -- meaning Blizzard gets $0. At $15, I might get two.
[2:49:06] Holysal: My tin foil hat is they wanted $15 so they released $35 so they look good when they lower it LUL
[2:49:07] AnubiS1690: It’s not about the $15. They won’t stop if we keep buying that shit
[2:49:10] AstridLory: Thats merged for live tbc servers?
[2:49:20] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Is my luck really that bad when I enter giveaways in your Discord? Haven't won a single damn one I entered.
[2:49:31] NexusOps: @Holysal thats what I was saying earlier LUL

[2:49:36] ArcaneSyntax: nope fuck that shit, get me the hell off vanilla.
[2:49:38] razlive: im happy to pay $15 for clones.... we need to support the game though if we wan them to invest for  devs and time into it. e.g look at the shoddy video they just released with an intern voice over!
[2:49:39] ez_ak_spray: Waste of money for the clone
[2:49:40] Waspire: excessive greed
[2:49:50] AnubiS1690: I’m making a level 1 clone. Fuck blizzard
[2:49:50] MuttonChopins: that merged is for classic servers not tbc @AstridLory
[2:49:52] cmonBroh: pathetic
[2:50:03] Fawcheddar: "hey survey said you guys WANTED to give us money Kappa "
[2:50:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: buying deluxe day 1
[2:50:09] nerdtopia: exactly
[2:50:11] Motivess: @razlive just goes to a new yacht
[2:50:13] nerdtopia: blizzard is a buisness
[2:50:19] nerdtopia: they stoped carring about making a good game
[2:50:23] Gid86: were did i find witch server that gonna be merged?
[2:50:29] AnubiS1690: If you buy deluxe, you are the problem
[2:50:34] HonestPhilosophy: Honestly the people who care enough to make posts about it are definitely still going to buy it
[2:50:36] AstridLory: Yes im buying deluxe prepatch day!
[2:50:45] nerdtopia: sue me @AnubiS1690
[2:50:49] CrusaderNero: they dont even need everyone to like it
[2:50:50] ez_ak_spray: The people that don’t support it will still buy the boosts. I wish that made any kind of sense
[2:50:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: my money my choice
[2:50:51] SonofHorus82: @AnubiS1690 cant wait to be part of the problem.
[2:51:00] PappaBeardK: like, 69% of the people that complain about the BC shit is just the Asmon fan club
[2:51:03] 수줍은: True am too lazly too level up and ili just buy a boost PepeClap
[2:51:08] ArcaneSyntax: "blizzard is so greedy" gives you 3 games for the same sub price most of the playerbase has been paying for years.
[2:51:12] Amarlian: Do you think they looked at it like a cheaper version of the boost and priced it based on that. @Towelliee
[2:51:20] nerdtopia: theoretically it could happen but it won't LUL
[2:51:20] AnubiS1690: You neckbeards can do whatever you want. I don’t need shortcuts
[2:51:27] ThorH13: what server again?
[2:51:29] DrimdosGaming: DrimdosGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[2:51:36] nerdtopia: congrats buddy want a cookie? @AnubiS1690
[2:51:38] SonofHorus82: @AnubiS1690 that's because you're super cool.
[2:51:40] throwawaym3: EXACTLY
[2:51:42] Vaedrun: Poor Bobby, no 67th Tesla him today
[2:51:44] SlayerLightStorm: @ThorH13 Azuresong.
[2:51:47] sooziecuzie: Good morning everyone
[2:51:48] greywind317: Honestly a clone should be 10$ because 35per toon is a lot lol but it’s wow that but took to buy is going to be mashed hard
[2:51:55] ThorH13: @SlayerLightStorm towHAMUP
[2:51:58] SeargentHartman: preach Towelliee preach
[2:52:00] Motivess: @anubis1690 I need the boost because I ain't a neckbeard lol
[2:52:04] nerdtopia: exactly it doesn't affect my gameplay in anyway
[2:52:07] tangochief83: I havent spent any extra money on the game and I don't plan on it. But I don't give 2 shits if someone else does
[2:52:10] tangochief83: agree with you completely
[2:52:21] SuperBrotendo: those same people are the same ones who run around yelling about "cancel culture" and shit
[2:52:25] ez_ak_spray: What’s the point of an mmo that you can pay your way through.
[2:52:26] Vaedrun: my son does that
[2:52:28] nerdtopia: my experience is not dependent on how other people chose to enjoy the game
[2:52:28] tangochief83: its like getting mad because someone buys 2 ply toilet paper when you by 1 ply
[2:52:29] Spykex02: We are in too deep boys blizzard could charge $200 for tbc and I’d pay it
[2:52:30] AnubiS1690: A bunch of suckers getting fucked by corporate America. Grats
[2:52:30] 수줍은: True KEKW
[2:52:35] cmonBroh: that's why private servers were better and will be better , it's just that they don't have the support of the millions of the people , they all wanna lick blizzard's dick hole
[2:52:39] CrusaderNero: tbh I barely managed to get my pala to 60 in classic, so im gonna use one boost for another class
[2:52:43] uxibixu: I’m afraid the monetization will only get worse
[2:52:43] PidiaP: Asmon does so he can make content Kappa
[2:52:49] jeneraljelly: im honestly glad people that are coming back to TBC can just buy theboost itll keep them around
[2:52:52] throwawaym3: Bunch of communist fucks, trying to tell me how to spend my money!!!
[2:52:57] SlayerLightStorm: I gotta get ready for work. I'll be on later.
[2:53:08] manmower: looking good is a form of power
[2:53:13] moonscryer: @Towelliee it seems in all this BS people have lost the true point of the whole thing - we FINALLY have Burning Crusade again in a supported official server. anything else, my money.
[2:53:18] SonofHorus82: @AnubiS1690 are you saying that you dont utilize corporate america?
[2:53:18] jeneraljelly: Gatherer
[2:53:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: gathermate
[2:53:21] Bombayshow: just dont buy the one promoting china bullshit
[2:53:23] sadalxx: gathermate2
[2:53:26] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee man i hate blizzard, im quiting for aoc which has a 500$ alpha they keep delaying.
[2:53:31] azzacopey: @Towelliee You were travelling when I was last watching, went for a work call for 60 minutes. Come back and still travelling haha.... Clasic WoW
[2:53:32] Motivess: @anubis1690 lol, it takes 200 hours to lvl to 60, I make 40 in less than 2 hours, why wouldn't I use it
[2:53:36] tangochief83: gathermate2 and you have to get the repository addon too
[2:53:37] throwawaym3: @Bombayshow amogus
[2:53:42] Wildside1177: Further south in cavey atrea
[2:53:43] Shrenko: most ore are in the caves by all the elites LUL

[3:11:34] zx10rx: 3090 retail price is 1800
[3:11:34] TommySeeker: RAM makes it either work or not
[3:11:36] Sollice: Find me any pre built thats from a reputable site that has a 3090 for anything less than 2500
[3:11:38] Motivess: pre-built desktop
[3:11:39] TMMOOF: @Sollice Maybe if Bill Gates did a giveaway LUL
[3:11:43] Sollice: and 2500 is CHEAP
[3:11:49] codedizle: my computer with a 3090 was almost was 5k LUL
[3:11:51] Blvdman: 32gb I'd say would give you maximum comfort room
[3:11:55] mett7: 32GB is ok

[3:11:58] D3m0nHunt3r666: PogChamp

[3:12:55] shookhunty: monkaW
[3:12:55] nerdtopia: RAM just allows you to do more shit at a time
[3:12:58] zx10rx: most important thing is to not let your CPU bottleneck the GPU, otherwise FPS drops are massive
[3:13:15] Nico_vdM: More RAM allows Chrome to open a few tabs more
[3:13:18] cabalish: 32gb is ideal for 11900k and 3090
[3:13:20] Sollice: @Motivess It was said you could get a 3090 in a prebuilt for 1k. Thats what I was responding to
[3:13:34] TommySeeker: every gb is ram is two more chrome tabs
[3:13:41] Fluisterwoud: already getting a new pc?

[3:13:58] mizerboy: so what processor are you getting @Towelliee
[3:14:01] Blvdman: Is there a reason chrome eats soo much or just a bug?

[3:14:38] Sollice: Also, I am not spending 1.3k on a Dell Pre Built that will use a thermal throttled case, sub par cooling, proprietary motherboard single channel memory, a stock CPU cooler and the cheapest of the cheap 3060
[3:14:48] Motivess: @fluisterwoud he did, it's the streaming one
[3:14:50] Sollice: I run a 10600k, 32 GB 3600 ram, 2070 super

[3:15:58] LSBreed: gifts he's just ballin out
[3:16:04] Sollice: @tangochief83 Nah ryzen 2600 is still a pretty decent lower tier CPU now. I don't think it would bottleneck a 2060
[3:16:05] NovaSun84: god damn I wish I had a Federal govt budget like buddy had FeelsBadMan
[3:16:09] Motivess: @sollice we were talking about 3060ti lol

[3:18:43] Xytrixz: Im so glad I did my last PC upgrade just after they announced the 30XX cards, got a cheap 2060 before the market crashed
[3:18:43] zx10rx: well minus the GPU shortage guys, miners and scalpers are a problem

[5:20:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: people are always mad
[5:20:56] crawcook: It's not pay to win, but unfortunately the store shows they rather go retail route than an OG mmo
[5:21:13] Alepouditsa: nuh i will wait and then see if i buy it or not i never pre-order
[5:21:19] j_bar111: Riot has been doing really well at picking up a new game type and thriving, valorant is doing pretty decent

[5:22:05] onyx_pupper: bonds dont do much
[5:22:05] zx10rx: If riot is smart they can utilize their runnetera world well. It has really interesting lore
[5:22:10] akleb: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight kind of a good mtx tho
[5:22:11] crawcook: They could make enough money from subs if the game is actually good.
[5:22:26] crawcook: Blizzard made millions from subs

[5:22:44] mmrghost7: riot mmo is gonna be free to play vers wow that u gotta buy it to begin with
[5:22:47] remixonfire91: whats the problem with costemic mtxs? if you dont want to spend money just dont
[5:22:49] starsinthevoids: I want TBC 2.0 in Retail =)
[5:22:50] joe_g_433: So true. They are a business. It’s simple
[5:22:51] ShadoodHD: ah yes, survival to the fittest Keepo
[5:22:54] remixonfire91: cosmetic*
[5:22:58] soysos91: MMO genre is over-saturated right now so not one MMO is gonna make enough money from subs.
[5:22:59] Takinshotz: Just Box price like a normal game?
[5:23:02] crawcook: I disagree, in a case of mmo gameplay isn't all.
[5:23:12] Blistz1: it will probably be for cosmatics

[5:24:02] onyx_pupper: back to miniclip we go
[5:24:08] trivwik: CyberPunk 2077 was on to the new trend
[5:24:10] S1appadabass: There is an MMO with shit gameplay, Classic WoW

[5:25:41] NA_Mus: Maybe they can get honor points Kappa
[5:25:52] Shugaze: thats what im saying, its amazon!
[5:26:01] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee what if the store is full of crazy stuff, but you can exchange in-game money for cash shop currency?
[5:26:01] New_Bermuda: i think that's his point. amazon is going to value profit above everything.
[5:26:08] Wulfgrym: they need to create sustainability and profits
[5:26:17] 91Niki: People forget that games these day today is more expensive to maintain, than they were years ago. In game purchases is just gonna be a thing to help the company keep updating and maintaining the game
[5:26:27] Heekss: How do you think Amazon became so wealthy LUL
[5:26:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: ready for amazon to do away with twitch subs and just give us emotes for all streamers and no ads Kappa
[5:26:34] crawcook: Subs used to work, later some business people figured out that they can squeeze more from whales.

[5:27:40] remixonfire91: KEKW
[5:27:41] Nontus135: what MMOs are F2P anyway?
[5:27:45] DrakhanGaming: Runescape has been a sub based game since 2001, there is free to play but you only get access to like 20% of the content
[5:27:48] Shrenko: @thrakan84 its free up until the 2nd expansion
[5:27:49] LordKain73: no, it's only an issue when wow does mtx
[5:27:51] crawcook: Just because they have a store doesn't mean it should have it, it encourages hunting for whales instead of actually making good gameplay.
[5:27:56] Wulfgrym: It's good, get rid of the trash to make room for the players at launch
[5:27:59] NA_Mus: so serious question when is blizzard gonna give us a whale shark mount
[5:28:04] NovaSun84: 500 bucks to play AoC right now is kinda cringe though...
[5:28:17] Dkgungo: because asmongold was upset they are upset lol
[5:28:32] joe_g_433: @towelliee are you going to stream mythic raid test later?
[5:28:40] thatkidsscootin: wow charges subs
[5:28:42] PoppaMetal: the investment is risky
[5:28:43] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee can we also expect we get everything for free and meet all our demands, since we are all going down the delusional hole
[5:28:52] DrakhanGaming: League of Legends makes bank off skins, riot will 100% make the mmo with a store
[5:28:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: @thatkidsscootin so does ffxiv
[5:28:57] oreo_mintx: yeah for sure though QoL stuff should be included in the game. Should not be something that can be bought with RMT
[5:29:01] gangstafred: the game is buy to play with no subscription fee, i see nothing wrong with cosmetics shop
[5:29:26] PappaBeardK: @Towelliee You have to remember, most of the people that are mad, is the throng of Asmon zombies who don't think anything on their own
[5:29:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: skins everywhere
[5:29:37] NA_Mus: riot has always had a store LUL
[5:29:39] SonofHorus82: All games should just be donated to us, be free to play for all expansions and all game functions. We should be given every mount, pet, toy, and cosmetic in a nicely wrapped gift.
[5:29:40] NinjaGlovz: WeSmart WeSmart WeSmart
[5:29:43] Wulfgrym: wait...you're not judging us on how we spend our money, you can't possibly be a gamer, lol
[5:29:44] DyedFuelOnly: micro transactions have plagued a lot of games and not just MMO's. but ya its not like your forced to buy things. does tend to get annoying sometimes though
[5:29:46] spanij: man i hate Asmon i dont no how is get so many ppl at is so sad
[5:29:46] NovaSun84: The guys who made LoL... no store COPIUM

[5:30:00] oreo_mintx: yeah but who cares for cosmetics. As long as the in game obtainable gear looks somewhat bad ass
[5:30:07] thrakan84: Riot has MTX before Tencent ever touched them
[5:30:24] fatalityphase: They will sell cosmetics because that is what Riot excels in.
[5:30:30] manmower: got that sweet gov backing
[5:30:31] Wulfgrym: gamers have fun, companies make billions, happy people on all sides
[5:30:35] kokochris: Tencent is also huge in Movies and TV Shows in China.  They are a company like any other
[5:30:41] DrakhanGaming: Thats something I dislike about PoE, gear looks awful and the onyl cool gear costs irl money, waste of time, uninstall
[5:30:45] onyx_pupper: riot has one of the best art teams they know what they are doing
[5:31:07] DrakhanGaming: Runeterra lore is amazing, an mmo would be amazing
[5:31:09] crawcook: What is more exciting in an mmo? The fact you see someone with Blades of Azzinoth or the rainbow transmog with wings at start of Shadowlands? Cosmetics meant something else in the past and they were part of what defined an mmo.
[5:31:09] MuttonChopins: Riot do make great character and art designs thats for sure
[5:31:25] Osowareru: As long as you're not forced to buy MTX i don't see why ppl get upset

[5:32:18] gryn: amennnn
[5:32:19] Wulfgrym: LOL towelliee is blowing players minds right now
[5:32:21] ahies28: ahies28 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[5:32:24] gryn: Preach amennnn
[5:32:26] Sollice: BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU WOULD NEVER WANT IT YOU CANT GET IT FOR FREE REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[5:32:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: if a rainbow shoots out of his ass and kills me then its a problem
[5:32:30] stresstest: people need to stop worrying about controling what others likes
[5:32:31] Osowareru: skin = skill Kappa
[5:32:35] Templexx: its even better to pvp with that mog on hehe
[5:32:35] codedizle: if you wanna buy the transmog so be it lol who cares
[5:32:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:32:37] Alllprimer: Exactly finaoliveHype SeemsGood
[5:32:37] Mecabeast: a mog you can't even see cause you're zoomed out all the way
[5:32:40] dabinsky: @Towelliee we kiss
[5:32:44] SsenkradDesruc: Even if they add the boost on day 1, what does it take away from your gaming experience? You can still enjoy the content and eventually catch up, get to max level 2 days later and call it a day, this is not Black Desert, where you grind to stay competitive
[5:32:45] Eastwicksavag3: that's extra content you can do in the game to receive
[5:32:48] starsinthevoids: I mean, getting weird and bitchy over cosmetics is wild
[5:32:50] DragonofWolves: Plus if you wanna get technical towelliee, rift LITERALLY has entire tier sets ON TOP of max level boosts. if New World can top that then ok sure
[5:32:53] crawcook: True :D
[5:32:58] Bombayshow: i dont care about transaction , but that pig thing from china is a big no no
[5:32:58] NinjaGlovz: PepeClap PepeClap PepeClap
[5:32:59] Wulfgrym: I love it, i could care less what another person does or spends their money on
[5:33:17] Niksen_99: it will be like POE :D pretty cool shit
[5:33:22] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Rift FeelsBadMan
[5:33:24] Aquadriel: why do i care whatever some other dude has while i am riding this BADASS FUCKING CRAB @Towelliee
[5:33:25] IamEavrus: aslong as they dont pull an archage
[5:33:30] joe_g_433: Will you be streaming mythic raid test later?
[5:33:42] DrakhanGaming: what did people like about wildstar? I missed that wave?
[5:33:50] Shrapnel_1974: rift and Black Desert had a ton of Potential
[5:34:02] oreo_mintx: The problem is not people spending money; the issue is that people spending money are getting arbitrarily "nice" looking stuff than people who rather obtain things in game
[5:34:06] lord_euphi: They already told on their twitter that the game will not launch with boosts. only costmetics
[5:34:14] WarGothica: even archeage has the option to see others with default costumes if someone bothers about cosmetics
[5:34:37] DrakhanGaming: man that heavenly serpent is my fav mount in the game, wish i could farm mounts
[5:35:05] Wulfgrym: I totally support them putting a boost in the game at some future date
[5:35:08] Aquadriel: BuT I dOnT WaNt BoOsT
[5:35:09] onyx_pupper: they wouldnt kill their own game before it comes out especially with how much money is backing it
[5:35:16] crawcook: I understand if people care only about gameplay, I am actually part of it, but I also believe cool rewards you got from raids or other high end content was part of the experience for many, and that was destroyed so a corporation can benefit from whales.
[5:35:21] Bombayshow: Imagine if nintendo sold finished games LUL
[5:35:34] spacemarine55: Boost later won’t matter rush will be over
[5:35:36] Dutch_Freddy: @Towelliee What's the goldcap in this expansion? :o
[5:35:43] TombStoneMercenary: Boost is bad mmmkay!!!
[5:35:45] nightmayor12: it's almost like blizzard wants to get people in the door to play their game
[5:35:48] Niksen_99: Towel on fire today KEKW
[5:35:51] DrakhanGaming: No one sells finished games anymore honestly
[5:35:56] onyx_pupper: but its not like you can get the store stuff in game so it has no effect on other players
[5:36:00] soysos91: never even heard of New World haha, I'm out of the loop
[5:36:04] Aquadriel: at the end of the day wow still king and boby kotick wins EZ Clap
[5:36:06] Bombayshow: Boosting makes me feel like the game is a shore but that my opinion LUL
[5:36:36] N0sticma: month later ok
[5:36:44] IamEavrus: EZ fix add achivements for people who level up without boosts
[5:36:49] Buckwink: boosting in tbc isnt pay to win fuck that leveling lol
[5:37:19] MrGattz: anything that you can just throw $2000 to be above and beyond everything and everyone else is a major problem.
[5:37:21] onyx_pupper: gonna  have guilds powerleveling a few players and farming equipment for them if thats the case
[5:37:21] crawcook: Yes, it is a big part.
[5:37:26] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: thats how it was on the preview
[5:37:28] Utmost777: nah, crafting is just one part
[5:37:30] MrGattz: especially in crafting which is the entire point of the game.
[5:37:30] Wulfgrym: i personally think its smart, to add boosts later on, it allows new players to easily join the game after launch
[5:37:34] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: going to be different on live
[5:37:43] Privack: everyone is so lazy lol
[5:37:46] SonofHorus82: I'm still confused about as to what exactly we win with that?
[5:38:12] DrakhanGaming: Retail is basically pay to win now, You can just buy gold cap in wow tokens then pay for carries with gear funnels for gold and its all allowed and you wont get banned
[5:38:13] Redpandalol: It just feels like we as consumers are being nickel and dimed.
[5:38:13] Utmost777: just because crafting is actually useful unlike wow doesnt mean it is the whole game
[5:38:17] Holysal: all these ppl complain but happily rmt in classic KEKW
[5:38:20] nightmayor12: kingmo30Yao
[5:38:21] mavericks312: ppl want an mmo that rivals WoW but shits on every new mmo that comes along
[5:38:22] MrGattz: new world will be DOA mark my words if they put any pay to progress anything in the game.
[5:38:25] SenseiDomo: isnt wow a subscription based game doe? owo
[5:38:31] NovaSun84: Insert Joker LULW
[5:38:35] oreo_mintx: @MrGattz big true
[5:38:36] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee is this mount farming the replacement for Sha?
[5:38:37] Wulfgrym: ..... NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:38:38] Aquadriel: what a glorious boy
[5:38:40] Niksen_99: LOLOL
[5:38:40] NovaSun84: P2W character towRee

[5:38:57] crawcook: I don't mind it man :D
[5:38:59] Redpandalol: Shitty business practices
[5:39:08] Wulfgrym: imagine paying money to support the things you care about....
[5:39:08] soysos91: I am now upset and angerz you used money to buy that, I now hate wow Kappa
[5:39:10] crawcook: I am like you, I don't care, but I can understand the other side
[5:39:10] lowpolyxD: As I said before I think people should just focus on themselves, play the game, dont listen to others, and not be poor lulz

[5:39:28] Holysal: @MrGattz mm hype kind died for it
[5:39:28] thrakan84: is that a horde character?
[5:39:36] Privack: cosmetics that dont carry that much value are fine, but actual items that give an advantage over other people is NOT fine.
[5:39:55] Privack: it ruins the experience for others
[5:39:56] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee have you heard about GMR crypto currency, bought some of it last week
[5:40:10] NovaSun84: (Smart MMO developers anyways)
[5:40:21] Colt_Engineer: but is it going to creat a...New World MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL
[5:40:30] spanij: ya world of warcraft rocks no 1 can bet the game
[5:40:36] jkitchin75: @onyx_pupper i want world peace we is both out of luck
[5:40:50] NovaSun84: I don't expect Phase 2 to really put a dent in anything...
[5:40:59] Wulfgrym: @jkitchin75 hahaha
[5:41:03] evad1971: The only thing that this new MMORPG is hoping for is that there isn’t a Call of Duty release eotjer
[5:41:08] starsinthevoids: Blizz just needs to have an actually functioning schedule lol
[5:41:13] spanij: no game can beat wow
[5:41:20] neugassh: new world will be relevant for 2 weeks maybe a month
[5:41:26] Tjc222: Tjc222 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 104 months! 
[5:41:41] Wulfgrym: if you want a game that makes no money, then put up the millions to make that game and charge nothing for it, have fun
[5:41:44] Mecabeast: there isn't a big enough overlap with their cod player base and wow player base to worry about it
[5:41:46] zx10rx: Riot's MMO is the one to watch out for once more info comes.
[5:41:55] mavericks312: blizz normally does have a functional schedule but 2020 threw a wrench in it
[5:42:10] DragonofWolves: meh i think New World will be a fun game, it was fun to me anyway when i played it

[5:42:27] AndrewShifuVA: hello there, general Towellliee
[5:42:27] crawcook: I also focus on gameplay, but I also think mmos saw the biggest success and popularity when it wasn't only focused around gameplay.
[5:42:35] DrakhanGaming: they will have a fighting game and mmo too
[5:42:47] totallypayingattention: right when school starts LUL

[5:43:46] spanij: both game r same and hey cant beat wow
[5:43:56] Sollice: Maybe they should just let people play their shit instead of looking for an oppertunity to sell more packs
[5:44:15] Sollice: Or see their shit not play
[5:44:33] thrakan84: warmode on or off?

[5:44:47] Tjc222: What's going on Towelliee? Love the new setup you have.
[5:44:52] Nontus135: Classic Wrath will just suck up all those people lost to those other MMOs probably.
[5:44:58] thrakan84: k just flying out
[5:45:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: wait until AoC tests their version of a cash shop LUL
[5:45:48] Shrapnel_1974: It does look good
[5:46:11] toyhgar: wow towelliee colset looks awesome
[5:46:20] Aidler: I have a feeling Asmon has some investments in AoC
[5:46:32] Tjc222: I don't think a sub is a bad thing but, it would be nice if the sub was like $5-$10 instead
[5:46:34] spacemarine55: It’s the same model neverwinter had
[5:46:48] TheSlideeHoe: thoughts on New World?
[5:46:52] NovaSun84: if they do free 30 days... that would be great to me... the box price of 60 USD is getting old fast to me
[5:46:52] stallowned: how much is the sub? if its 15/mo like wow that might be too much

[5:46:53] DragonofWolves: But towellliee is it blizzards choice to try and release WoW's patches around other MMO's or is it Activisions choice to make blizzard do that?
[5:46:54] SsenkradDesruc: If they want to compete with WoW the sub fee has to be significantly lower
[5:46:58] NovaSun84: Look at Outriders... RIP
[5:46:58] Xanigh: I mean, since it doesn't have 40-60e Box price, people think that oh, paying 13 for it now isn't that much
[5:47:08] onyx_pupper: its the same thing with among us. game got super hyped from sponsorships for a sub-par game
[5:47:12] thrakan84: come on Earthen Ring. You are letting me down
[5:47:17] Holysal: @o_illusionz yep.
[5:47:25] othraerir: he tells you want you want to hear
[5:47:34] winchez_: no box price, does that mean we get expacs for free/subbed?

[5:47:44] VladVolynine: narrator: it didn't
