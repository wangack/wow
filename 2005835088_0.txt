[5:16:44] ewing46: "supersedes" is the word he is looking for there
[5:16:53] skajamme: soda is such a tool
[5:16:54] McQueeb: @ghostyashley raiding guilds have always been like this. Always
[5:17:05] EngeltheFallen: soda is not in the wrong here
[5:17:05] KayTeaHolmes: I feel like he is gonna try and wipe on rag
[5:17:10] EngeltheFallen: and he been good to balt
[5:17:11] KayTeaHolmes: But thats just the doomer in me
[5:17:18] NorikM: most chill raid leader
[5:17:19] Kinghorn: hopefully he just kills himself
[5:17:22] Shigglefits: They pickup the hands on that last one?
[5:17:23] Kinghorn: Prayge
[5:17:29] SattRahm: Prayge
[5:17:33] AstralCharge: demote his ass again
[5:17:39] KayTeaHolmes: I mean one mistake in this raid could mean 10+ people dead on some pulls
[5:17:39] EngeltheFallen: also he is dealing with streamers, he knows he needs to yell to get them in line
[5:17:42] ItsJustMiz: I'd love to have soda as a leader
[5:17:47] Euphiris: Soda is completely justified. The veterans should not be messing up here
[5:17:48] KayTeaHolmes: hes being hard because he has to be
[5:17:52] PaperbackWritter: Miz Pog
[5:17:53] AdeptStrain: I can never tell when Soda is actually pissed or just joking. Pretty sure CDank is the one messing up
[5:18:00] Cnith: oh uh hope some funky pull of Golemagg doesn't happen on that bridge
[5:18:08] PaperbackWritter: yeah, he is probably truly pissed now
[5:18:14] quantic_gamble: what is happening
[5:18:17] EngeltheFallen: yeah cannot not either if hardass soda is legit or him really taking the piss
[5:18:18] NorikM: OMEGALUL

[5:18:51] Shotouw: @Euphiris I mean its pretty stupid to run in and while pulling switch the assignments away from the ones in the raid sheed FailFish
[5:18:52] bodli1125: oh all still alive good to see
[5:18:54] KayTeaHolmes: Gotta love the good old, MY SHINY mentalty
[5:18:55] zephyrozenwater: usually yeah.
[5:18:59] zephyrozenwater: raids are hell lmao
[5:19:05] ClingyTripod: Why is he so mad?
[5:19:10] ThersitesX: damn, american raids are super dramatic..
[5:19:12] Madaggar: @DarkMeos not really, but the stakes are higher in HC
[5:19:12] ItsJustMiz: Tell em boss
[5:19:13] 13orgin: Doesn't feel like classic WoW without some rage
[5:19:16] OhkE: we need CoNtenT
[5:19:21] Cnith: it's just his style to go from 0 to 100 and down again within 2 secs
[5:19:22] Gameboy736: soda is like a drill instructor, he yells so people are on high alert and do their best, doesn't mean harm
[5:19:29] ladywaggeldaggel: Hmm its understandable that there is a lot of tension, a lot of time invested and to loose it because of some dude is enraging
[5:19:34] DarkMeos: @Madaggar okay cobaltRIP
[5:19:39] Euphiris: Maybe mastayoshi bribed for the power infusions KEKW
[5:19:40] KayTeaHolmes: @ClingyTripod lots of people making mistakes that could acctualy wipe people. plus just being dramatic
[5:20:10] bodli1125: geddon already down ?
[5:20:15] EngeltheFallen: yeah
[5:20:16] Kinghorn: why is this not being live logged :/
[5:20:27] Kinghorn: cant see who is getting Pied
[5:20:32] ClingyTripod: But they are killing everything fairly quick.
[5:20:59] MistahZed: Death happens faster
[5:21:11] bodli1125: yep but ragi still there
[5:21:37] KayTeaHolmes: everytime i see that lava surger come around the corner i just thinkg "DEJA VU"
[5:21:44] Davechilla: let him cook
[5:21:52] Brayney: yes chef is a cooking show reference
[5:21:54] zephyrozenwater: because he's projecting "soda is being as mean as Gordon Ramsey"
[5:21:58] zephyrozenwater: and ngl it's kinda funny
[5:22:01] ClingyTripod: I understand now. Lol
[5:22:06] EvilLime: ^
[5:22:07] Brayney: yeah gordon ramsay
[5:22:21] Shotouw: Because he is screaming around like gordon ramsey. Only he doesnt know what he is doing LUL
[5:22:22] Nam3Lessz: no one has died still?
[5:22:27] KayTeaHolmes: Its not a gordan ramsey thing, as a cook by trade, alot of chefs are like that
[5:22:29] Fedup75: pure chaos
[5:22:44] SummonMaggie: @nam3lessz unfortunately no one has died
[5:22:53] AdeptStrain: Just one very close call
[5:22:57] Guhzeebo: didnt one die?
[5:23:01] Nam3Lessz: idk if that’s unfortunate
[5:23:07] its__fil: Fluid BabyYodaSip
[5:23:10] EngeltheFallen: the person who died was no in raid
[5:23:14] MistahZed: insert spongebob water meme
[5:23:18] ClingyTripod: The yelling is unnecessary tho.
[5:23:28] zephyrozenwater: @KayTeaHolmes yes it's a normal chef thing, but what other chef has 5 hit tv shows, 30+ michelin stars, and is known worldwide that is ALSO as mean and cruel as a PCP addled military instructor?
[5:23:28] MistahZed: content
[5:23:48] Sato_Mori: you try to wrangle 40 people in vc without yelling lol
[5:23:56] NorikM: litterbox?
[5:23:57] NorikM: wtf
[5:24:05] ClingyTripod: I don't have that many friends
[5:24:11] Shotouw: @zephyrozenwater Nah its a full tv persona. and only for the us series as well. On UK TV he is already way nicer.
[5:24:12] MistahZed: LUL
[5:24:12] AdeptStrain: Not even 40 people. 40 STREAMERS.
[5:24:18] AdeptStrain: Big personalities

[5:24:52] Sato_Mori: their job is to speak so it's understandable
[5:25:11] Madaggar: Nah, Soda is doing a good job. He's no being complacent, like he's leading 38 copies of himself
[5:25:16] bodli1125: never like him
[5:25:29] xFith: a fraction of his (power) ego
[5:25:32] KayTeaHolmes: @zephyrozenwater Im just meaning, almost every chef i have had in a place above your random greasy spoon has not been too far off when shit is going that bad, the thing alot of people dont realize is the production staff purposely put undercooked food and swap plates out to get those reactions.
[5:25:34] Endermanshadow: how far are we
[5:25:40] PaperbackWritter: cobalt gonna kick PogChamp
[5:25:48] SMDoles: what does your shirt say big dawg? i love it when my wife does what?
[5:25:50] bodli1125: 3 boss shoud be left
[5:25:57] KayTeaHolmes: But most of the time your kitchen is never gonna get too that state of chaos
[5:26:01] bodli1125: 4 with this one
[5:26:20] Sato_Mori: I love when my wife doesn't notice I purchased another MTG deck or smthing like that
[5:26:31] EvilLime: its reality tv ofcourse its over the top, ever watched wrestling?

[6:46:56] drewdoob: he only said it because he was butt hurt and wanted the turban
[6:47:00] EngeltheFallen: cdank who may not get invited to next raid
[6:47:11] gregormi: Cdank is going to purposefully wipe the raid eventually. He was telling his chat earlier that he was thinking about it.
[6:48:06] RoseSakurako: questions are raids fixed and I mean do guilds follow a certain way to do them or it depends on updated contents and lore thus they raid certain areas?
[6:48:14] Mx_Hsp_101: so hows everyone today
[6:48:23] gregormi: He said he was going to hold off though because he thinks yall are going to go for bwl way too earlier since this is going so well with world buff crutch
[6:48:33] Shadewfire: yeah after that pull to “keep a faster pace” is grounds for kicking
[6:48:57] gregormi: I literally don't even know how to clip. I rarely watch twitch just thought this would be interesting
[6:49:07] aly09848: Yeah it’s dangerous to tell someone they may get benched next raid for the simple fact that they could just wipe the raid because they are salty

[7:03:06] PhillyUrbs: watch the hand of rag item drop
[7:03:22] V1dd3: Is there an ETA of the fight? Getting mighty sleepy here, but I wanna see it
[7:03:47] RoseSakurako: is Lisa into any of the games you play? @CobaltStreak

[7:04:55] Dedolin2167: @CobaltStreak Tell her to play Faefarm. My wife is into all the same games as Lisa and my wife is loving that game
[7:04:56] Euphiris: Yakuza is so good
[7:04:56] Guhzeebo: 15
[7:04:57] Rustlingrose: Raft was a vibe
[7:05:00] Gaskerino: 14 is the MMO
[7:05:00] Sato_Mori: car = 15
[7:05:06] Rustlingrose: OW
[7:05:07] stoney_entertainment: raft was awesome @Rustlingrose
[7:05:12] EngeltheFallen: fae farm looks great
[7:05:14] OverlordFuzz: Raft killed me with those sharks
[7:05:14] kaisnipplez: 14's the MMO. I'd be concerned if she 100% that
[7:05:17] EngeltheFallen: raft was really fun
[7:05:21] cheduranga: CoD
[7:05:24] StewzoM: fae farm is amazing
[7:05:26] KayTeaHolmes: I 100%'d FF10 with my husband its his fav game
[7:05:29] RoseSakurako: nice choices, so she can relate when you tell her about wow raids
[7:05:33] KayTeaHolmes: i think we have done it like 3 times
[7:05:47] Rustlingrose: oh 10 is a good one lol
[7:05:51] FrostySprinks: why isn't loot given out at the very very end? so that only survivors get the loot? or unless they need it for the raid
[7:05:59] FatHalpert: i really miss the first like 6 months of fortnite, lol so much fun
[7:06:03] SattRahm: @kaisnipplez someone actually did manage to 100% FF14. Pure insanity
[7:06:05] EngeltheFallen: triple triad
[7:06:09] HessianX: 9 is best
[7:06:17] Nuez2680: I love 8, but never finished it. My disc 4 had a scratch
[7:06:17] TheMoltenGuy: I was not a fan of the leveling system in 8 at all
[7:06:25] KayTeaHolmes: I never really got into FF but 10 was alot of fun, made me want to play alot of the others
[7:06:27] strimmlarn: 6, don't care that all towns looks the same.
[7:06:28] AvatarEnd: quistis was the best. rinoa smells.
[7:06:42] RoseSakurako: FF7 and 6 are my favorites
[7:06:43] PaperbackWritter: ff8 lisa based
[7:06:50] FatHalpert: ffxv is my favorite, love that one
[7:06:51] SalmonSnake: Rinoa is a bimbo lol
[7:06:56] TheMoltenGuy: if we're talking *any* FF then mine is definitely 14, hands down, no competition
[7:07:03] Euphiris: That much resistance + GFPP should be pretty cozy in the Rag fight
[7:07:07] FatHalpert: well ffxiv is my favorite but that's not really mainline FF LUL
[7:07:08] TheMoltenGuy: if only singleplayer ones then either 3 or 6
[7:07:09] SalmonSnake: I actually just downloaded FF8 today. Gonna start playing it after this raid
[7:07:09] Dinth1: 7 still the goat
[7:07:14] Souleater207: any loot for cobalt?
[7:07:19] Euphiris: 39 gnomes and a bear
[7:07:29] KayTeaHolmes: Ive started FF9 but never really got around to finishing it
[7:07:33] Sato_Mori: 16 looked good but I didn't play it
[7:07:37] KayTeaHolmes: according to my husband im about a quater through
[7:07:55] HessianX: how about taht sweet essence of pure flame trinket?
[7:08:05] aglon6: did I miss rag?
[7:08:07] TheMoltenGuy: 16 has sweet music and boss fights
[7:08:11] TheMoltenGuy: definitely up there for me
[7:08:12] FatHalpert: aglon6 right now i think
[7:08:13] Euphiris: Rag is coming up
[7:08:15] TheMoltenGuy: can't wait for Leviathan DLC
[7:08:16] HessianX: LUL
[7:08:18] aglon6: nice
[7:08:24] HessianX: I used it on my pvp paladin, thorn build

[7:08:54] th0rxtheimpaler: i wish i could mute everyone but cobalt lol
[7:09:03] RoseSakurako: @KayTeaHolmes it's a huge game, and most of the ppl I know didn't even finish the game, it has many aspects. I think it needs like 90-100 hours for 100% completion
[7:09:06] TheMoltenGuy: which one, Lisa?
[7:09:20] FatHalpert: is that the infinite wealth one or is that different?
[7:09:24] KayTeaHolmes: The new yakuza is part of a diffirent main line series though right? ive never played them but i thought the like a dragon series was diff just in the same time and universe
[7:09:38] NorikM: @Rustlingrose the island one?
