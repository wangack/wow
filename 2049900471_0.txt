[1:35:08] viclund1: PepeLaugh meanwhile raid gear -35 stam KEKW
[1:35:10] Nunadaaa: is there a single thing left to discover in season of discovery guzu or is everything leaked
[1:35:11] Ceodewd: Too much gear with stam+spellpow would benefit the locks way too much tho

[2:20:40] 3Brick_: :tf: OPS the hunter pulled threat
[2:20:40] Blufootgaming: yeah...so its salv for horde
[2:20:41] Tetra_zb: Maybe using it on yourself as a Shaman tank?
[2:20:41] twitchforgotmyaccount: Pet tank rune
[2:20:43] ritter184: Click off salv alliance side then

[2:20:44] Erockk610: it’s more of a tricks of trade type thing I guess
[2:20:44] Roccox2xx: there is prolly a tank threat drop@mechanic where this rune will thrive.
[2:20:45] junckster: reverse salv
[2:20:45] Fogfight3r: So you can have wf isted of rockbiter perhaps?
[2:20:47] 7osei: if the tank does more threat dps can pump more
[2:20:47] SilaarFR: to troll the annoying mage in the group
[2:20:47] DamDamPew: yeah exactly Horde version of salv. more zug
[2:20:48] PockCst: @Guzu or use it on urself instead of Rockbiter weapon so u stiull have threat

[2:20:48] MiegorengNoodles: RF
[2:20:49] Destroy_Me_DADDY: Yes but that would be the same thing as salvation to everyone else
[2:20:49] Smooo07: put that on a healer hehe
[2:20:49] Jeburial: theres no difference between generating less threat and tanks generating more WYM
[2:20:50] Jellooze: @Guzu  its salvo but works the other way around
[2:20:50] arobba: yes so your dps wouldnt need salv
[2:20:50] 3Brick_: :tf: OPS the hunter pulled threat 󠀀
[2:20:52] Mr_Moffert: seems like a wasted rune slot
[2:20:54] gurjan: reverse salv indeed
[2:20:55] Heisenberg: @Guzu can the tank use on himself?
[2:20:55] crazyboy1_: its the same as salv if u put it on tank the dps dont get aggro
[2:20:56] Fanatical29: Guzu guzu guzu hi
[2:20:58] Raekthechef: yeah buff the tank threat so like they dont lose threat instead of pressing salv on someone high on threat the guy just doesnt drop aggro at all
[2:21:08] ritter184: Why doesn't horde have blessing of might?
[2:21:12] LuminescentLlama: icecreamsogood

[2:34:49] bl1nk_1298: @ooTHExTUBEoo do mages get 100% crit damage in their talents like warlocks do? genuinely dont know
[2:34:51] draqcula: yes its dull
[2:34:52] Ophelly: warlock runes are welly meh

[2:35:43] bl1nk_1298: @awesome_day_to_you cause class/race combos are a semi important part of class fantasy and the "classic" feel. Rune abilities at least keep that going, but having gnome paladins,  a race that has no "holy connection", is jumping the shark some
[2:35:45] esbi__: Warcraft 3 Illidan Pog

[2:36:39] Toastedyogurt: druid PauseChamp
[2:36:42] awesome_day_to_you: @awesome_day_to_you So, bending rogue into tank is fine. But having a Gnome who studied under Paladins in ironforge is too far?
[2:36:45] AllVirtuall: wrath
[2:36:46] sunmantv: wrath
[2:36:46] finalfork: i want to have 3 pets angy

[2:37:24] Ophelly: warlock was already a well rounded class in classic... but the runes they added are pretty meh. Like it's good but nothing exciting
[2:37:27] alexgoat94: @Mr_Moffert shocked to hear it was a 17 year old lol
[2:37:30] johnnypoison69: boring ass runes but locks are still gonna be sick
[2:37:32] big_bang_impact: Looking at pandemic my eyes are happy as a warlock main lol
[2:37:34] grylz89: That's huge
[2:37:37] Kinghorn: 30% spell haste in classic is giga
[2:37:38] bl1nk_1298: @awesome_day_to_you yes, because warlocks were tanks at mutliple different points in classic, and the Dark Apotheosis glyph existed in MoP already. Same with rogues, back in OG vanilla my guild would have a rogue tank a boss here and there with short enough kill times
[2:37:41] grylz89: Mini bloodlust
