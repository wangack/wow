[0:37:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK tank... use marrowind and death's caress for bone shield, keep blood boil charges rolling, heart strike and death and decay on enemies, death strike to heal
[0:38:28] Thunderbrew: I'm a bit torn who to root for. I grew up a 49ers fan. Montana is my favorite QB. Montana did play two years for the Chiefs and my wife lives in Missouri.

[0:41:05] Wulfgrym: the chair is ready to lvl
[0:41:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: The bone shield gives a bunch more armor so it's pretty important to keep up that between like 5-9 charges and not overcap on it

[0:42:33] Wulfgrym: im pulling for the 9ers
[0:42:50] Niksen_99: Who is playing at halftime show this year ?
[0:43:20] Pups_Gersky: @Wulfgrym Running bet is how many times she will be on screen.
[0:43:27] Wulfgrym: Usher
[0:43:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: People are picking the Niners by 2, they definitely have enough talent to win it, but Mahomes has done it before and that helps him
[0:43:49] Wulfgrym: @Pups_Gersky according to all the people who hate me on facebook, shes barely part of the broadcasts and im over reacting
[0:43:50] Thunderbrew: I like Taylor Swift. She seems nice.
[0:44:13] Pups_Gersky: Every streamer I watch are going 49rs.
[0:44:37] Wulfgrym: i just cheer for Purdy, so much hate for a guy who has proven hes better than his draft position
[0:44:45] geokouts: what position is that Swift girl playing? :P
[0:44:48] PotbellyGoat: CMC said something nice about Breece so I'm going 49ers
[0:44:50] mavericks312: give me the chiefs, I just don‚Äôt like the 9ers
[0:45:18] ThreeBombs: smart money is on the chiefs
[0:45:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: If Purdy can win it, good for him, that's my take
[0:45:22] Wulfgrym: I personally have no issue with taylor swift, im just tired of the media using the cheap publicity, just my opinion i know lots like it
[0:45:27] PotbellyGoat: @geokouts receiver?
[0:45:40] Wulfgrym: its not just a tv thing, its in the news, articles etc
[0:45:50] mavericks312: @wulfgrym I don‚Äôt even think she is at the game
[0:45:59] Thunderbrew: The real winner is Las Vegas. So much money pouring in.
[0:46:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kelce is really good, but yeah the media coverage is just kind of ewwww
[0:46:07] geokouts: so if Swifts bf team loses the relationship is over? jk
[0:46:19] PotbellyGoat: Oh she's probably flying in from Japan or whatever. Her fan base figured out the flight logistics already
[0:46:23] mikael_jansson90: one question. Why do u americans call it American Football when u run around with it in your hands?
[0:46:35] Wulfgrym: yeah, good for them, hope they last, all the best.
[0:46:37] PotbellyGoat: Because we won 1776

[0:52:12] Wulfgrym: playing paladin, war tanking is tedious
[0:52:22] geokouts: almost 30 lvl and i am loving it. No dungeons so far
[0:52:35] 3663Sharad: 2 mages, at least one will be alive KEKW

[1:00:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Cataclysm Classic launches on or before August 31, 2024." I think that's a kind of legal placeholder date

[4:24:22] zelours: wrath sod
[4:24:25] zelours: tbc sod
[4:24:30] TheGiant99: @Wulfgrym ok wasnt sure
[4:24:33] im_capy: SoM did it too
[4:25:07] ClassicMalcontent: If they offer a choice (hopefully) for era or others. I like retail for Cata or beyond content.
[4:25:28] im_capy: Ya, they let you move them and ya SoM was a failure by the end
[4:25:58] ClassicMalcontent: No
[4:26:08] ClassicMalcontent: No no. I dont want to go to Cata Classic
[4:26:19] ClassicMalcontent: I am hoping they allow just Classic Era option
[4:26:28] zelours: bring new content to classic, increase lvl 70 etc etc after phase 4?
[4:26:31] ClassicMalcontent: Or for others to choose cata
[4:26:49] Thoreya: surprised theyre not keeping wrath servers
[4:27:21] JBonezey: SoD shows they need to keep giving it content
[4:27:28] JBonezey: SoD servers are packed
[4:27:29] PvtHudson093: What do you think will be the lvl 50 raid?
[4:27:34] bmi86: SoD killed wrath
[4:27:36] theDirtyon3: reeee gdkp
[4:27:44] hammack52: they could move them to cata servers cause all but the new tank and healing runes, most of the rune will get overriden by the cata class changes
[4:27:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are quite a few people in Wrath, but most will be fine going to Cata
[4:27:45] theDirtyon3: retail andys trying Cata for sure
[4:27:57] im_capy: I think so too, Cata Pvp alone is better than wotlk
[4:28:31] bmi86: no one wants cata. cata was a dog shit expansion
[4:28:57] theDirtyon3: ^ lol wrong
[4:29:09] JBonezey: Cata with better timed patches is very good
[4:29:16] 91Niki: @bmi86 That is called a personal opinion and doesn't apply to the masses :)
[4:29:16] diederik_1985: xD
[4:29:18] im_capy: I think more people want the community to stop telling them what they want and dont want
[4:29:19] Cael175: Dogshit is such an overreaction lol
[4:29:19] TheGiant99: wont ctat not last very long with the xpansion coming vedry soon after
[4:29:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[4:29:28] ClassicMalcontent: Glad those who want it are getting it. I'll be fine in Retail and in Classic Era or SoD type realms.
[4:29:48] warrenny: ‚Äúi dont want cata therefore nobody does‚Äù
[4:29:50] futomara01: i never get surveys :(
[4:29:58] hammack52: here is the real question, how many of the people in the survay where trolling blizz to see how far they are willing to take this classic thing
[4:30:09] warrenny: i want cata cos it mean mop classic
[4:30:47] PvtHudson093: Do you think Sunken temple will be the lvl 50 raid?
[4:30:49] TheGiant99: will people play cata over war within
[4:30:50] theDirtyon3: mop classic is the real end game
[4:30:52] Darthyrevan: id play tf outa MoP Classic
[4:30:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: For some, yeah Cata is necessary to get to MoP

[4:32:25] JBonezey: They should have came up with a new term from Cata to WoD
[4:32:34] im_capy: Shouldve just been classic era, and everything else a remastered release or something since they are changed Vs the OG
[4:32:47] Thoreya: im excited for cata bc that means were close to mop
[4:33:26] moonscryer: I don't think its a name problem. I think for most its realizing you are 14 years older LUL
[4:33:39] ClassicMalcontent: Cata should be referred to as "Redux" (as in Cata Redo Part Deux) ha. Or w/e Kappa and yeah I enjoyed MoP but I'm retail and w/e classic eras are fine for me. At least glad to have classic era options.
