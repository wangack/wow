[6:47:03] OkayegBOT: @0verflux Wakaliwood ghetto rally! You, along with 19 other commandoes raid through Wakaliwood to get 200 egs. Although you step on some poopoo and kill some tiger mafia mercenaries, you get the dirty job done and you split it evenly with your 19 other commandos. 🇺🇬 | +10 egs | Total egs: 62 🥚
