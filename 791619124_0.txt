[0:10:37] TheUnknowing: I'm on my last character I need to get to 50 on my new realm and thats a priest, at 44 at the moment. Have leveled 5 characters since the patch came out, then i'll be done for awhile once the priest is finished lol
[0:10:40] touchofpinkfizz: @MrGattz ah ok
[0:11:03] MetallicusGaming: Thor2k4 I switch around, this void elf priest I'm doing (35 atm) 10-20 bc dungeons, 20-30 Mop quests, 30-35 doing WoD atm
[0:11:05] MrGattz: i might finish leveling my dk to 50. its already at 30 but man blood dks are so slow.
[0:11:06] spookaninja_21: I‚Äôm sitting at 48 on my new rogue main! Taking my time as there is no rush to get to 50 rn
[0:11:14] ShadoodHD: how's it going hammah squad towHAMUP
[0:11:41] CrumbySmash: Hey guys I want to start with shadowlands soon, any recommendation for first character class?
[0:11:48] spookaninja_21: @shadoodhd great! Yourself?
[0:11:52] CrumbySmash: Maybe something that I could level up fast
[0:11:57] MrGattz: honestly whatever you find to be fun @markela021
[0:12:05] RocketTanks: @markela021 Warlocks are fun, strong, and have a lot of solo-ability. Same with Hunters.
[0:12:05] MrGattz: there is no best class really
[0:12:15] Thor2k4: you like range or close up? and do you want to be solo or have pets?
[0:12:27] spookaninja_21: @markela021 go with what sounds the best. Playing a dps would be the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù route though
[0:12:28] Eikus11: Warrior the answer is always Warrior
[0:12:42] Thor2k4: ^ you splet shammy wrong
[0:12:44] ShadoodHD: @spookaninja_21 doing good man thank you! just resting before work tomorrow so it's a good break for once lol

[0:13:48] Eikus11: @Apoplect1c yeah, about 12
[0:13:51] Slitze: legion is not the best chromie exansion to play when you've been drinking. they dame games and hoops
[0:13:51] amricatt: I am leveling all the classes for funsies
[0:13:57] NestLucky: hi guys a question which is the addon of the enemy health bars? that us towelliee
[0:14:06] NestLucky: use*
[0:14:07] MetallicusGaming: plater
[0:14:07] Noshpan: Depends on the style of DPS you wanna play. Want to be melee? Ranged? Magical ranged?
[0:14:08] Thor2k4: plater
[0:14:30] tibbus1730: Good morning!
[0:14:32] Eikus11: yeah I'll send you half
[0:14:45] Porkbutt1984: danSip
[0:14:54] CrumbySmash: @Noshpan no pref tbh, what's fastest to level up and hopefully start working on getting some golds for tokens
[0:15:08] Slitze: especially on a shadow preiest with no flying at lvl 22 it sucks ass
[0:15:35] moondotnet: heyy
[0:15:50] Noshpan: Hmm. All classes seem to level pretty fast these days with the new leveling revamp
[0:16:01] Noshpan: But I think I would suggest Hunter totThinking
[0:16:05] Slitze: i'm talking about the hoops and games
[0:16:12] Eikus11: @markela021 I would say hunter is a safe and fast first class
[0:16:13] Slitze: on a shadow priest fuck that
[0:16:36] CrumbySmash: Thanks, and what about realms if someone from EU is here ^^
[0:16:42] Slitze: i guess most classes don't get their aoe until 30s
[0:16:53] NaifeTv_: @markela021 are you horde or alliance?

[1:27:27] volkreig: Do you think Echo will do well @Towelliee
[1:27:34] MrGattz: its called being realistic
[1:27:41] KrypticOctopus: @volkreig yeah, Echo will do pretty well
[1:27:45] fufufighter: What happend to Kungen, you said after what he went through
[1:27:56] KrypticOctopus: Echo still has a LOT of core talent
[1:28:06] TheFabilolz: Blue Mic and Logitech i think

[1:28:12] PToastman: What did you say about swifty!?!?
[1:28:13] Antdavs24: lol cant have realistic conversations any more without someone being offended
[1:28:15] MindMelt: they're arguably better without Sco LUL
[1:28:19] mmo_kenna_: What's gunna be the BIG channel to watch RWF on?
[1:28:21] mo197: it is like saying the Cavaliers are going to win without Lebron
[1:28:36] WhiteKnight74648: Good Morning
[1:28:38] netblackfire: it's called talking its what us old folks been doing for years nothing wrong just talking about it
[1:28:40] warrenny: Sco and josh only?
[1:28:41] Bugszy: funding is completely diff
[1:28:46] Bugszy: as appossed to sponsor
[1:28:53] TrieCC: If you think this is talking badly about someone, you shouldt prolly be out in the world lol, u in for a suprize son
[1:28:57] Getitonthelow: did sco stop raiding?
[1:29:11] totawm: lol this pile on
[1:29:16] callum_bm: yeah they just get paid for sales through their link
[1:29:16] Alienfromger: @Getitonthelow no hes still leading method
[1:29:20] simonbgg: But did Method every go out & speak publicy & said that their players were getting paid?
[1:29:44] Molseh: @Simonbhehe yes players were contracted per tier
[1:30:17] simonbgg: @Molseh Ye I know that but did Method ever go out publicy & tell everyone about that? I dont think so.
[1:30:18] falldrgn: @Simonbhehe They never disclosed the terms of the player contracts
[1:30:19] Kratostheboss: towAlliance
[1:30:30] Hidden_Citizen: is complexity world first caliber?
[1:30:40] callum_bm: Do you think all the money thats going into WoW worlds first etc improves the gameplay itself though
[1:31:04] Hidden_Citizen: @devho yes i havent really watched the world first stuff
[1:31:04] L00deFame: what about OTK
[1:31:04] Moobot: Towelliee's girlfriend, twitch.tv/lulaboo, has a brand new cookbook! If you like cooking or know someone who does, check out this fully tablet/pc/phone compatible cookbook for only $9.99! https://lulas-store.myteespring.co/listing/lulaboo-cook-ebook?product=960Featuring
[1:31:17] MrGattz: otk doesnt have money
[1:31:22] Slitze: how much though?
[1:31:29] mmo_kenna_: It's still early days for eSports
[1:31:32] falldrgn: when you get a peripheral sponsor.. do they just send you free stuff all the time?
[1:31:34] MrGattz: theres a reason they were literally begging for sponsors the other week
[1:31:38] MetalManGG: @MrGattz no world first caliber players either
[1:31:46] simonbgg: I got a college at work knowing Gingis girlfriend. He gets around 3-4k per month from method.
[1:31:47] Wugrok: the money otk did have got spent on genshin impact KEKWlaugh
[1:31:50] Getitonthelow: I heard they get 50k each
[1:31:50] KrypticOctopus: also a lot of these WF raiders are also full-time streamers and get paid that way
[1:32:00] callum_bm: WoW was never designed to be an eSport imo and they struggle to try and make it that way
[1:32:12] laughinbuddha: Must be an only child hah
[1:32:12] NiteshadezTV: at least youre honest lmao
[1:32:25] KrypticOctopus: no, not all by no means
[1:32:31] squigglytv: whats your thoughts on no more multiboxers?
[1:32:40] Slitze: compared to you. fuck no, you're always online
[1:32:44] quakegoogl: rayray666Bun
[1:32:44] Dionaut: I hear yea man. Thats what they did at my old job when i worked in a restraunt. Had to share all our tips. So I would get a phat tip, and then have to go share it with the shit bag who just hides and plays on his phone.
[1:32:46] Podo321: So not joining OTK anytime soon...got it. Lol
[1:32:48] mmo_kenna_: Towelliee you've thrown cash into wow events before tho for prizes
[1:32:56] Flocked21: max is a bit of an arrogant prick
[1:32:58] Bugszy: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:32:59] Thunderbrew: People have to keep in mind that this is ultimately a Community event... the World First Race and the MDI. Blizzard has nothing to do with it.
[1:33:06] falldrgn: I think its the streamer money supports them.. but the Org money is where they bring home the bacon
[1:33:07] LoudGrk: how did u get ur elvui to work
[1:33:09] cuddlytoxic: hammer squad seems so chill
[1:33:14] quakegoogl: rayray666Bun Squid4 towBeer PopCorn

[1:33:34] mostluckydan: @towelliee do you get along with the otk guys like @asmongold and esfand
[1:33:41] R2RHIN0: or just getting what you deserve
[1:33:49] sawnerus: if max wasnt limits GM he wouldnt have all those viewers. sometimes its warranted sharing the wealth
[1:33:53] pjc1897: Goooood morning!
[1:33:54] Oldd_Gregg: If you put in the time to build your brand on Twitch, you deserve more money, not greed at all.
[1:33:54] Slitze: boom there he is
[1:33:55] Antdavs24: lol anyone who says greedy would do the same thing given the opportunity
[1:33:56] OzzyBBQ: its a fine line to walk between what people percieve as greed and good business practice :D
[1:34:24] KrypticOctopus: what's the 50k coins for?
[1:34:51] mo197: 100k coins for mount

[1:35:38] sawnerus: yea, but using the guilds branding
[1:35:40] Brodih_: Max is much more entertaining that Sco on a normal day tbh
[1:35:57] simonbgg: @Qhaz_ Ye Sco is very bland
[1:36:03] sawnerus: if ur using the guilds branding to get viewers and attention, you owe the guild
[1:36:18] TimeToCream: You and lulu (I think was her name) still together? SOrry if too personal!
[1:36:42] mostluckydan: @foozer_ 100%
[1:36:54] mo197: but potential to be more....now investing in future is business too.
[1:37:06] Antdavs24: @Arhell yea exactly, if you work your ass off its warranted. same with sports, lebron is making more than everyone else on the lakers because he'll win you a chip
[1:37:10] aleyztwitch: how long do u think it will take to world first kill ?
[1:37:44] Dionaut: Yup, first raids always go down quick

[1:37:59] killerteapotsftw: ofc they relaxed noone to challenge them right?
[1:38:04] Antdavs24: there coms during raid is hilarious
[1:38:09] zeiours: They don‚Äôt have the pressure of method any more.
[1:38:10] manmower: they must have a lot of Canadians
[1:38:20] brutalwarr_90: and woot about preheat?
[1:38:26] Arhell: @Antdavs24 exactly, ppl saying otherwise or greedy makes me KEKW
[1:38:32] Rollies: when you blowout you always play worse like anygame
[1:38:37] Brodih_: @manmower haha! I actually asked Max once, but he said only 2-3 if I remember
[1:38:38] bollespacing: Towel what is that transmog?
[1:38:39] sevens777s: Do you think wow will ever have more races ?
[1:38:39] Crafty_plays: what do they get for winning WF race?
[1:38:42] Rollies: like golf its a brain game
[1:38:45] squigglytv: pieces are waiting to take over
[1:38:47] Anbean: Exsorsus also
[1:38:48] Antdavs24: they might have more pressure now than before lol
[1:38:48] Dionaut: Feel it comes down to the leadership. Like you said about max. If you have a chill lead who can handle those situations with out losing his cool. It makes a huge difference
[1:38:51] zaela29: i don't think bdg is going for wf final boss anyways
[1:38:56] Zomgboy: these Chinese guilds were awesome but 2 days behind if not more

[1:39:01] falldrgn: no.
[1:39:01] mojusk: i think this race will be very interesting
[1:39:27] falldrgn: he was not part of the Potter, scripe, roger and meres brain trust
[1:39:29] BigRooster45: Max himself keeps saying that Limit was the best guild in Nya and people need to remember that the winner will be the best guild in Nathria
[1:39:30] Anbean: Roger and Scripe did tactics
[1:39:42] doomester: @Towelliee are you sure that SCO was a good tank?
[1:39:45] sevens777s: Does Method still exist
[1:39:46] R2RHIN0: he only really prepped his monk too, he wasn't prepping 3-4 tanks like others did
[1:40:10] Opti87: The org is starting to rebuild, not sure bout the guild though
[1:40:27] warbabam: Methos is recruiting for world first race

[1:41:03] Arhell: the first tier of shadowlands its going to be very fun to watch and play
[1:41:09] Thunderbrew: Who is taking that bet?
[1:41:22] sevens777s: @Towelliee betting on wow is your fix for no casinos I see ;p;

[2:06:59] Richhomyjuan: @Allan_ dont need an explanation of something i know already, i'm just saying its annoying, thank you tho
[2:07:03] BowSec: if a viewer clicks an ad and purchases a product or service do you get commish ?
[2:07:04] MrGattz: @hero7ff i mean thats just twitch playing ads when you come into a channel. they do that for every channel. no one likes it.

[2:08:46] bigangry360: Waiting to build new PC since can not find the video card I want for it
[2:08:49] Affiiance: I mean a PS5 is for ppl without a good PC as well, theres not that many exclusives that are really worth
[2:08:49] Taemek: Is Assassins Creed Valhalla going to be Online?
[2:08:52] Richhomyjuan: i just bought em both cause why not
[2:08:57] Malindan: Did you see the series s having less than 400gb storage? That‚Äôs so little. Modern warfare is already 250gb. LUL

[2:09:54] TheUnknowing: I mean whenever i can afford one of the new consoles ill be getting the ps5, just cause the exclusives are too good.
[2:09:55] Antdavs24: series S is just to replace the current xbox which is pointless
[2:09:57] Torbane: yeah crazy size

[2:10:17] dalix13: doesnt the new xbox compress the shit out of game sizes?
[2:10:25] MrGattz: yeah they said that cold war is 250gb ish if you want to play on ultra but you can choose to not play on ultra and get a smaller download
[2:10:25] kingjimmy666: @kohwai sup?
[2:10:26] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee good morning man
[2:10:27] MOLAR305: @towelliee what is the ea pass that you have?
[2:10:28] Mistrfurious: needs it's own dedicated ssd
[2:10:32] jure__: warzone is staying the way it is, you wont have to redownload anything, so cold war should be the remaining 150gb then
[2:10:32] BuddySinister: I uninstalled COD because the game size and the updates were so large. Lol
[2:10:37] TompsonX: I'm probably getting a month of Ubisoft + for Valhalla

[2:16:12] syncacide: stonks
[2:16:14] c0ldbloodead: It's not bad, but I would reccomend something lighter for FPS'. I use a G-Pro Wireless. But Scimitar is still a solid mouse, just because of the button quality they upped the size a bit.
[2:16:23] mur0c: what was that game?
[2:16:32] laifstaile: Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Game Pass for PC members receive EA Play. EA Play Pro is only available through EA‚Äôs PC platform, Origin.

[2:17:01] Manahotep: Razer fan all the way but can respect Corsair as well
[2:17:02] refluxuations: mmo mouses are too heavy for competitive fps gaming
[2:17:02] TompsonX: Now that I play MMos I just use the mmo mouse for everything
[2:17:03] Crafty_plays: I have two mice hooked up lol

[2:17:36] c0ldbloodead: I've tried Razer MMO mice over the years, and the button quality just isn't there imo. They don't press as deep, and they are a little shaky too.

[2:26:08] Janigiv: black desert Kappa
[2:26:10] Garrek__: I love SWTOR
[2:26:12] Velashen: GW2 and FFXIV. ESO feels like poop.
[2:26:14] SGT_Nuck: star wars is still great.
[2:26:21] Rottencoarse: FF14 maybe?
[2:26:22] SGT_Nuck: they take my money all the time lol
[2:26:26] sarcilav: @Towelliee how are your plan looking for raiding castle nathria? also any normal/heroic runs planned regularly with viewers? EU?
[2:26:27] SGT_Nuck: :P
[2:26:31] GoreCity: swtor for sure I've put some serious time into
[2:26:32] MrGattz: eso or ffxiv, swtor is a great game but its not massively played anymore
[2:26:37] kohwai: swtor is fun to go back to once in a while to play thru the story
[2:26:37] PowaPatrick: ff14 you can play free up to lvl 60, you have access to Realm Reborn and Heavensward
[2:26:38] Czyszn: i play ffxiv at a high level and its really good and very high quality
[2:26:44] SGT_Nuck: the interface editor in that game rocks dude.
[2:26:55] DaddyOpe: wait what? what is this starwars mmo?? called???
[2:27:01] Polysac: ashes of creation will be next gen
[2:27:01] Vivelli: i like ffxiv for fuckin around, but doing serious raid or dungeon content? no
[2:27:13] SGT_Nuck: star wars the old republic
[2:27:14] Srdjan91: @Polysac next dead gen*
[2:27:16] Zomgboy: when was prepatch hitting?
[2:27:17] Czyszn: raids are the best part in ff14 lol
[2:27:22] TheUnknowing: swtor @opzter_
[2:27:26] radimier: how many alts are u gonna try and maintain in shadowlands?
[2:27:30] Zomgboy: EZ Clap
[2:27:31] TheFabilolz: towHAMUP
[2:27:33] Kromede: towHAMUP
[2:27:35] mmo_kenna_: Neverwinter is alright to kick back and play on console
[2:27:38] maardal: BOP BOP
[2:27:40] m__ber: üî®
[2:27:41] Malindan: Pog
[2:27:41] Rottencoarse: @Zomgboy its already out. event is next week
[2:27:44] PsychoByn: any id√© what class will be the best for melee users in shadowlands?
[2:27:45] Masqerader: honestly probably faster on Warmode at this rate
[2:27:46] Polysac: @Srky91 I do believe it gonna be a good MMO - hopefully
[2:27:55] Zomgboy: ah yeah ment that thanks Rottencoarse!
[2:28:29] reaprwolf: damn 3.5 hours 10-50
[2:28:37] Czyszn: i just came back to WoW since WoL
[2:28:50] radimier: how many alts do u think ur gonna try to maintain in shadowlands?

[2:28:53] raspyoftow: gratz on that sha mount finally
[2:28:53] Czyszn: ffxiv feels so much better in terms of quality. but WoW combat is still really good
[2:29:05] keeindordel: champion, we need to mount up and heal the sky woons caused by Sylvanas WIndrunner! yae got to stop her! @Towelliee
[2:29:09] Coriollis: ff14 registration is terrible mkay
[2:29:14] Polysac: wow have the best tap-taget combat in any mmo
[2:29:16] ManneehFresh: how any mounts do you have? out of the total.
[2:29:18] Rottencoarse: swtor raiding was so much fun @Towelliee
[2:29:20] Coriollis: discourages me to evan play it
[2:29:28] Rottencoarse: have not seen FF14 or GW2
[2:29:32] raspyoftow: i havent played ff14 in years
[2:29:34] Czyszn: @Polysac agreed and that is coming from heavy ff14 player
[2:29:40] falldrgn: if you log in and just do dailies.. and some M+ and don't raid.. etc you have flexability to play other things
[2:29:43] WarcraftSteph: any Alliance na toons yet? I've got oondasta up
[2:29:45] Polysac: blizzard gonna suffer a lot if shadowlands gonna be as bad as BFA.
[2:29:54] SaDos: @Towelliee probably aoc when it comes out?
[2:30:01] Daringin: Once you start WoW you never go back
[2:30:03] Casiope7: Are you playing New World when it comes out?
[2:30:11] Brodih_: i tried ff14, but the starting zone is so overwhelming that I lost interest after 30 min
[2:30:12] Affiiance: I definitely enjoy my time away from WoW playing non MMO games
[2:30:13] Masqerader: NP sir
[2:30:15] maardal: BOP BOP
[2:30:24] Kromede: KEKW
[2:30:26] wasserhammer: I picked up FFXIV and ESO while waiting on Shadowlands..... FFXIV is ok, combat is slow as shit though. ESO is frustrating with keyboard controls. Haven't tried it with controller yet.
[2:30:30] Warcried: @Czyszn FF14 is great, but it's tab targeting could be even a little better...
[2:30:34] radimier: is there a clip of that?
[2:30:41] Masqerader: I use to be a myth/a legend
[2:30:46] Masqerader: @radimier yes there is
[2:30:47] Kromede: wasserhammer NotLikeThis
[2:30:48] AnsitarGaming: they say its on the spring
[2:30:52] Czyszn: yea if ff14 had slightly faster combat it would be best mmo
[2:30:55] radimier: @Masqerader can u link it?
[2:30:55] Casiope7: april 2021 I think
[2:31:04] Czyszn: but its combat now while amazing its definitely not better then WoW
[2:31:04] Brodih_: May will be close to classic TBC release right ?
[2:31:07] BubblePriest: new world is amazon tho
[2:31:12] swordwindgaming: FF14 tab targeting is like driving manual compared to WoW. WoW tab targeting just does what you want 95% of the time.
[2:31:15] Czyszn: after coming back since WoL WoW combat is superrrr fun
[2:31:15] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee THIS IS THE WAY
[2:31:28] HotHotHeals: WoW stops your from getting girls and playing other games, and we're okay with that
[2:31:37] Shawnyofthedead: they bring a knife WoW brings a gun
[2:31:40] SageRuskiy: !uptime
[2:31:41] Moobot: Towelliee has been live for 2h 31m
[2:31:51] Stephenevets: or get the girl, marry the girl, continue playing wow, and hope that girl doesn't divorce you
[2:31:54] MR_WYTE: Just tuned in - what's a 2-week mmo?
[2:32:00] Novirtue_: more like they bring a knife, wow brings a nuke
[2:32:07] darth3232: hey towelliee whats good man
[2:32:09] Coriollis: I feel they have a heavy grind because they don't have substantial end game atm
[2:32:12] Czyszn: another good thing WoW does is little gear upgrades +1 or +2 feels significant
[2:32:21] Rottencoarse: LUL
[2:32:21] Czyszn: i cant get +30 main stat in ff14 and not feel anything
[2:32:31] Coriollis: from New World
[2:32:33] GoreCity: @nevetsestevan that's where I'm at
[2:32:40] xxplicitt: Has anyone here ever been lucky enough to recover an old WoW account? I'm about to try and find my old vanilla account
[2:32:40] Phractals: @Czyszn ff14 combat is faster paced than a lot of the classes in wow. yeah you have a long gcd but you often have top press 2 abilities in between every gcd, making it a lot more involved
[2:32:45] Stephenevets: same, trying to marry the girl before i can reinstall wow
[2:32:51] raspyoftow: lol someone at huolon had his huolon pet renamed today
[2:33:06] Brodih_: New World is not out yet and WoW has 16 years, give it a chance
[2:33:12] Warcried: @xxplicitt even if it was your father's name on the account, you will probably get it back. i got mind back quite easily (my father's account originally)
[2:33:12] terribalgamer: didin't they switch away from pvp at the beginning of the year?
[2:33:21] Czyszn: @Phractals yea i know i have over 4k hours in ff14 its amazing the combat but WoW combat still feels more "fun"
[2:33:22] Coriollis: pve kinda felt repetitive for me same type of mobs placements and respawn places for all the zones
[2:33:29] swordwindgaming: In the current gaming industry, an online game has like 3 months to make its mark.
[2:33:36] Roren091: Albion online is going strong though
[2:33:42] Pharaoh_326: didnt like new world at all. combat sucks
[2:33:42] xxplicitt: @Warcried wow that was actually my biggest worry cause it was originally my younger brothers with his mother's info on it
[2:33:55] SageRuskiy: @towelliee I started raiding in gw2 recently and I gotta admit not having vertical progression really takes the oomph out of rewards from raiding, since you essentially only earn titles and currency for legendary gear
[2:33:57] BubblePriest: Im hyping over pantheon
[2:33:58] xxplicitt: Guess I'm gonna give it a shot
[2:34:00] Coriollis: like all the caves felt the same
[2:34:00] Archmoose: Where can you sell timewarped badges besides caverns of time? or do you have to wait for the timewalking events?
[2:34:03] Masqerader: @Radimier I forgot the clip is gone cause he had to delete his vods and stuff because dmca fears

[2:34:05] Polysac: LOTR MMO hope amazon dont fuck that up
[2:34:11] Brodih_: @NathanUnsocked same!
[2:34:18] Czyszn: @Polysac they will
[2:34:23] DeadlyDag: I play MMORPGs to relax (PvE). If I want to PvP, I play shooters (COD for example)
[2:34:27] Czyszn: you know what mmo feels like abosolute shit ESO
[2:34:37] Czyszn: i tried to get into ESO omg that game is so clunky
[2:34:44] onelegalthief: wait they made a guild wars 3? lol
[2:34:44] Xilice: Raiding came with 2nd expansion right?
[2:34:46] marty1g_: Hey, European here. Did Kanye win yet? Kappa
[2:34:58] radimier: @Masqerader ah thats a cock aint it
[2:35:01] Malindan: Gw2 doesn‚Äôt even have roles
[2:35:03] Thoreya: lost ark lowkey looked fire
[2:35:03] MrGattz: many years
[2:35:16] MasterInire: and, of course, a ton of MMO's run on their infrastructure
[2:35:20] Gapz: @Towelliee DAMN i love beeing in a politic free channel, Love you
[2:35:24] TacticalKabuki: WoW has ruined most MMOs for me as they just dont stack up
[2:35:32] Phractals: @Czyszn i disagree but that's fine. a lot of classes in wow are incoherently designed imo and only a few are up to the quality of class design in ff14. I still mainly play wow right now though and also love the game
[2:35:45] WhiteKnight74648: <3
[2:35:45] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[2:35:53] RealJudgeAce: KEK
[2:35:54] CullenPrime: The only thing that sucks playing an LOTR MMO is you can't be a Wizard because there are very few in the lore
[2:35:57] MasterInire: KEK
[2:35:57] LORDGARGALON: @YuKT LULW
[2:36:00] SageRuskiy: @malindan that is untrue; you have power dps, dot dps, boon support, heal support and tank
[2:36:00] Exodeo_: Can we make the internet politics free too? :p
[2:36:01] Knocx: is there a TW vendor up atm
[2:36:02] refluxuations: I went back to Lost Ark when the Russian servers launched. Was a blast until the ping during pvp bothered me too much :(
[2:36:03] greedysob: do you farm quest befor the timewarp thing?
[2:36:03] onelegalthief: why did the skullflame shield jump 20k on the auction house overnight Sadge
[2:36:08] sphynx_rayne: @Towelliee It's nice I can just have coffee and think about wow not everything else going on lol
[2:36:09] MarquisLek: are they still counting?
[2:36:09] jaykodiak: !ui

[2:36:17] Polysac: wtf I got suspended from writing anything ingame in wow
[2:36:18] xxplicitt: I finally tried FF recently and thought it was a pretty solid MMO. The lack of pvp really turned me off but I think it has it's place
[2:36:25] dimofodi: Weekly
[2:36:39] swordwindgaming: FF14 pvp is hot garbage. But its clearly not a focus.
[2:36:41] SageRuskiy: A lot of mmos are great as fill ins for when you take a break from WoW
[2:36:42] dimofodi: It reset with weekly reset
[2:36:44] Czyszn: @Phractals ffxiv individuality for classes are garbage. every class is technically the same in WoW every class feels completely different
[2:36:50] dimofodi: Emeriss is a B though
[2:37:04] applewarz: whats your xp bar addon? @Towelliee
[2:37:12] Malindan: @sage_ruskiy I remember it being a big selling point but haven‚Äôt played in a while. Did it change?
[2:37:15] Gapz: Lethon is pretty hard
[2:37:16] Fiirkan: no the duskwood is Emeriss
[2:37:18] Czyszn: and again i give ffxiv 95%/100 its still an amazing game
[2:37:29] greedysob: what i did for leveling is i got a bunch of quest at 45 in Draenor. you kill fast than go chormie and turn them all in
[2:37:29] dimofodi: The Nightmare one changes and this one is Duskwood
[2:37:32] mrzombiebull: @Towelliee so we moving to canada?
[2:37:32] jshaw12982: @Towelliee which expansion is most fun to level in (ignoring speed) in your opoionin?
[2:37:39] mrizzle12: Yeah, I just gave up on doing Emeriss in Duskwood
[2:37:46] swordwindgaming: The real issue with WoW pvp is its still kinda fun, but pillar humping is so stale and WoW pvp is just a way to kill time these days.

[2:41:42] t3ap0tt1: uh Voljin!?
[2:41:42] maardal: BOP BOP
[2:41:43] dimofodi: @Towelliee you can also go hang in Korrak for 200 TW badges if you wanted to. IDK if that's a one time or weekly though.
[2:41:44] PaPaBeaRCA: Sup guys been a long time... account been stolen just got it back few days ago

[4:14:11] LePython: @DeadlyDag running multiple accounts at the same time is multiboxing, you just have to control each on individually, rather than 1 keystroke controlling all 5 accounts for example
[4:14:17] NewWorldReign: Speaking of DMCA, that Dragon Force drummer got let back onto Twitch.

[4:14:48] balanira: its was because some nudity on stream

[4:16:41] Malindan: cod needs to get their stuff in order. No need for such big sizes with good compression algorhitms in the new consoles.
[4:16:42] tocu: yes
[4:16:45] Laxgrip: every stream i click on i cant escape it
[4:16:52] tocu: a 4tb stick for that would cost a grand though
[4:16:54] SubQ: luckily gen 4 prices are dropping
[4:16:57] PineappleBoB06: thats good those are so cheap now too
[4:16:58] MILESkg21: 4tb are about 1k
[4:16:58] Jodicus: It has to be a higher speed like 7000Mbs
[4:16:59] jure__: not sure, the system might be on the included one
[4:17:12] pedrodepacas1: unless it has a slot for bethesda games who cares ;)
[4:17:21] spankymcpie: just do your main games on the drive that it comes with, and hook up a usb 3.0 external ssd for the games you rarely play
[4:17:23] SubQ: not many nvme's hitting 7k right now, maybe a handful?
[4:17:30] tocu: @Towelliee its gen 4 m.2 a 1tb costs $220 for reference so a 4tb will be more than the ps5
[4:17:38] LegoCoin: BBB
[4:17:39] Malindan: Physical CoD next year will just come on an M2 drive.
[4:17:39] LePython: @DeadlyDag I mean, you're wrong, but hey we can disagree and gl finding the answer you want

[4:18:37] DallTV_: d2 dunn what to think tbh

[4:19:00] Seananigans_13: D2 is a scam
[4:19:07] Bardweiserr: got me right in the middle of a dungeon
[4:19:19] DeadlyDag: @LePython If you think I'm wrong, you should look up the actual term. Multiboxing means controlling multiple characters concurrently. Which has to be done with either SW or HW. If SW is not allowed anymore, there's only HW left. Alt-tabbing is not controlling concurrently, just fyi. per the definition :)

[5:50:37] ElPolloBatman: is she just getting her teeth brushed, or are they perhaps doing some fixing that requires a dentist?
[5:50:39] camslam: pretty standard for a pit
[5:50:40] chrisvscode: esp dogs

[5:50:42] gidgeet: My dog went under for his teeth cleaning
[5:50:54] netblackfire: and he lost like I siad most of his and is having the rest removed it will cost me another 3k
[5:50:56] soysos91: i think it's for dog and cleaner safety
[5:50:57] LegoCoin: depends I brush mine and give her raw hides - never had to go get done before
[5:50:58] VagueeAbstract: you tempted me last stream to finally get som GFuel ahah
[5:50:59] TrieCC: Must be an NA thig then i guess, i've never heard of that before
[5:51:00] doxxee: deep cleaning
[5:51:01] bigcountry555: brushing and anestetic cleaning is different
[5:51:03] Tonzeh: yeh my dog got its teeth cleaned last month and its a 6kg dog
[5:51:05] Technogre: our cat just had a dental got put under and had 3 teeth pulled
[5:51:10] tyrexxi: @TrieCC Same
[5:51:10] chrisvscode: it's just for the dogs safety so they don't struggle
[5:51:17] misterwinoe: No
[5:51:18] bigcountry555: we get under the gum line, check for pockets and infected teeth
[5:51:19] doxxee: like scaling and planing

[5:51:25] Azmaveth_Gaming: It's usually fine.
[5:51:27] MetallicusGaming: the carwash in your mouth = teeth cleaning
[5:51:28] ursinealli: no, she'll be fine
[5:51:31] MrArrig: 2-3 hour cleaning at the dentist? Wtf is that
[5:51:32] gshocker77: Fully normal.. the vet doesn't want to deal with sticking their hands in a dogs mouth

[5:51:42] Sam_Nash: my cat got it done and was totally OK after
[5:51:45] 2lu1z: 2~3h process?
[5:51:45] essential___gaming: it's completly normal for them to put the dogs under. She will just be drowsy but she will be fine. I worked at a vet for a while.
[5:51:48] Vivelli: she will just be sleepy
[5:51:52] gshocker77: Our dog gets that done once a year.. Dog is a little groggy but fine in a few hours
[5:51:55] TrieCC: Putting a dog under for anything is a serious risk
[5:52:02] ursinealli: as a former vet tech who has done many dental cleanings in the past, she is young and healthy and it will be a quick procedure and she will likely be fine
[5:52:13] bcole079: She'll be good she may be drowsy from the meds, but she will be okay
[5:52:18] Desanduin: @Towelliee When you were farming Sha how were you farming those bonus roll coins? Some Timeless Isle stuff?
[5:52:22] bigcountry555: the cleaning porcess takes 15 -20 min we jsut want the pets there for longer to monitor after anesthesia
[5:52:37] LSBreed: could have been a nail
[5:52:41] doxxee: she probably got her tongue in between the toy and her tooth
[5:52:50] watchthemgrow: I brush my two doberman's toofs weekly. They almost 1. :D
[5:52:52] gshocker77: When dogs get older they may need it yearly
[5:52:53] MetallicusGaming: might be a muscle aswell
[5:53:00] NewWorldReign: Maybe she pulled something in her legs when she was pulling back.
[5:53:01] Quackthyr: also tug-o-war is bad for dogs
[5:53:02] camslam: happened a few times with my dog, pretty standard
[5:53:17] Kasaiya13: yea some dogs don't do well with anesthetic so they have to keep em in for surveillance
[5:53:20] TrieCC: No, it's natural for dogs to do
[5:53:23] Blackrose_Darkthorn: breathing is bad for humans too aparently >_>
[5:53:25] bigangry360: ok where do i get the contents of the zip file and is that different then the toon setup tool?

[5:53:46] snoo_32: cominf from a guy with Kappa in his name LUL fact detactor check Kappa
[5:53:47] Quackthyr: tug-o-war promotes poor fetch/release behavior...
[5:53:47] TommyVercetii: i just wanna get to the weekend lol
[5:53:50] Kasaiya13: same with humans if they have anesthetic hospitals etc keep them in
[5:53:50] soysos91: dogs used to hunt down animals...tug o' war is fine
[5:53:51] chrisbros: Always win the tug of war

[5:56:33] SheTiltsMe: @Towelliee do you think Sco has any chance at rebuilding method WoW to a top tier raid team
[5:56:38] tyrexxi: ask whatever dude
[5:56:40] Baladore: Tug-of-war is an enjoyable game for the dog, and playing it strengthens the bond between the owner and dog. Tug games can build confidence and help the dog use up excess energy. Games such as tug-of-war provide mental and physical stimulation, and they can be used to teach a dog self-control. -from the akc site.
[5:56:56] TrieCC: It just means you care, there are no questions @Towelliee
[5:57:01] TrieCC: Stupid*
[5:57:19] MemoAcebo: i would like to join but i'm only interested in heroic raiding, not sure about mythic. schedule, work, etc. could i still apply? @Dcarter

[5:57:36] Rampy6944: know that is bud my doggo has to go in for a teeth cleaning too and im SUPER nervous about her getting put under for it
[5:57:36] bigcountry555: haveing the dog under anesthesia helps us get the teeth fully clean. we use an ultrasonic scaler to remove any calculus from the outside to the inside of the mouth. we check the gum lines for any pockets that could lead to infection. a dog like ony who chews things well help keep their teeth clean more then dogs who dont chew on things. yes you have to be carefull they dont chew super hard things were they can break a tooth.
[5:57:42] Malarick: we all react the same
[5:58:03] grizzlyhorn: we playing doom in here ?

[5:59:45] Codedred326: calculus? you remove math from a dog's mouth? devoOOPS
[5:59:59] kokochris: @Codedred326 math is bad for dogs..hmmm k
[6:00:17] bigcountry555: @Codedred326 yes the moment they know math the moment they will take over the world
