[7:06:51] Hedoh: I wonder if GPU or CPU is more important for handling all of the streaming stuff? Clearly GPU for the game, but I mean if you setup a second machine for streaming only
[7:07:11] Setupwizard: we should drop later!
[7:07:35] Hedoh: interesting
[7:07:43] GrayZeny: is cpu encoding better than gpu?
[7:07:48] Hedoh: yea 100% horribly optimized
[7:07:58] Setupwizard: its because you havent made enough microtransactions with activision
[7:08:00] jonathanezt: lvl 9, poggers. When u reckon hardcore gets hard, at what lvl?
[7:08:27] Setupwizard: same speed, diff dam
[7:08:37] Hedoh: cpu is designed to do a lot of smaller logical operations, and gpu designed to just do nonstop matrix multiplication - so I would thing cpu would be better for encoding

[8:56:40] Snyboii: The most difficult levels are prob between 10-20, because you have no tools
[8:56:45] newkingcody: SWIFTY the HC servers aren‚Äôt for pvp.
[8:57:07] newkingcody: You are too focused on pvp. The HC servers are for PVE.
[8:57:53] Capnrein: the people that die at lvl 1 just to troll probably bring that down a lot
[8:58:04] Retz1t: i dont get why HC community wont go all the way with the high risk version of wow by wanting PVP server HC, its like HC players want only excuse to level slowly
[8:58:05] Jen_A_Tolls: y u whispering?
[8:58:08] Galdrena: lol
[8:58:16] Snyboii: Not much higher i think, because people will be more greedy

[9:20:07] XLionGuardX: Your wand does as much as mind blast so minus well just wand
[9:20:15] Trickfinger01: problem is you can't heal at low hp because of gouge
[9:21:27] surchristoph: gg
[9:22:03] surchristoph: Nah its magic dmg
[9:22:07] Trickfinger01: i suppose you can top up your hp at around 60%
