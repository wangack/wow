[3:14:48] Interworld: I wanted to meet you mid
[3:15:01] Galdrena: @interworld why you stream sniping?
[3:15:31] realDonPanini: @shakenbaken01 You can duel to the death if you want to, but yes its pretty much a pve challenge.
[3:16:04] shakenbaken01: But why get rid of BGS what are they going to change in the game?
[3:16:16] realDonPanini: It would be impressive for anyone to get pvp ranked rewards with there being any people left alive.
[3:16:24] bijar: because the incentives are not aligned for regular bgs....
[3:16:37] realDonPanini: Hardcore challenge but die 1000x in bg's?
[3:16:39] Sunglassestony: There will still be World pvp?
[3:16:51] realDonPanini: You can kill people if they flag for pvp yes.
[3:17:00] bijar: @Sunglassestony yes you can opt in to flag for pvp
[3:17:29] player2two: bgs disabled
[3:17:39] shakenbaken01: yes real world open for deaths but pvp in BGS still open like always your eliminating a whole group to BG from the game...
[3:17:39] Interworld: @Galdrena I just happened to end up in the same bg
[3:17:52] Interworld: so I wanted to sit with him in mid
[3:17:56] player2two: i will not be playing hc wow. not for me

[4:50:08] Rockhound2006: i mean you all guys know what happened on classic start. Blizzard just revealed that ther will be like only 2 Servers. I just hope they get a really good amount of "layers" - "phases" that the Start will be not kind of catastrophic like the actual "Classic" release was.

[4:52:32] hotchilly: almost better to just wait on water totem until you have ghostwolf atleast
[4:52:34] hotchilly: so much running
[4:52:35] Varrii: Might be worth getting to 20 asap then going to do totem quests
[4:52:40] barlos124: I'm so torn on what I wanna play as hc
