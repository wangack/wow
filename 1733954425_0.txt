[0:37:37] makemorelove: how much costs to play this game nowadays like without limitations
[0:37:52] makemorelove: yearly
[0:38:11] HolySpiritActiv8: ah ok cool
[0:38:41] Featherbow: @makemorelove you can look at subscription plans on the website
[0:39:03] src1923: explosive is so dogshit
[0:39:31] Molvonos: Only if your team doesn't react to it  for whatever reason.
[0:40:00] Molvonos: By 15+, everyone should understand that they're all on Explosive duty and it's not just as <role> job.
[0:40:16] src1923: interrupt 4 adds dodge 3 things kill 4  explosvies ....ffs at this point dungeons dont need affixes anymore
[0:41:03] HolySpiritActiv8: don't they pretty much get 1 shot?
[0:41:29] Molvonos: Single AoE movement displacement interrupts 4 adds, dodging should be second nature, tank gets one explosive, healer snags another, dps get the other two.  still 2 chest the dungeon with 60K overall dps.
[0:41:30] HolySpiritActiv8: usually I see it die to aoe damage if i'm not mistaken
[0:41:32] Molvonos: I mean.
[0:41:44] Molvonos: Explosive cant be targeted by AoE
[0:41:53] Molvonos: You have to specifically pick em out and pop em
[0:42:02] src1923: you have to target them
[0:42:03] HolySpiritActiv8: oh ok
[0:42:10] src1923: most stupid thing ever
[0:42:34] Molvonos: I turn on enemy nameplates so I can click on them rather than trying to tab target through two dozen trash mobs

[2:07:42] Stoops21: /spit
[2:07:48] itsagentscully: two guys are 3.08 ea
[2:08:01] DallTV_: whats that ppl getting dmonitized on youtube for nothing
[2:08:18] Sanctana827: Why are people saying you need X amount of % before flying in? like there isnt trash surrounding the boss arena...
[2:09:03] itsagentscully: @Sanctana827 the trash packs around the final boss are least efficient in there, people suggesting are based on the premise you skip all trash besides batak and balara.
[2:09:25] Jaren475: what's prot-pally like in solo overworld?
[2:09:34] Molvonos: They're less efficient and stupid annoying due to fear.
[2:09:42] Recording_on_the_grass: lots of yelling
[2:09:44] Molvonos: Miss a fear interrupt, aggro everything in the zone
[2:09:53] abracka_: @Sanctana827 the trash packs surrounding the last boss are quite annoying and difficult to deal with. most of them hard stun + fear and do insane damage that can easily wipe the group and cause the key to fail
[2:10:55] captain_khyzan: where u make up the precent normally? before first boss u full clear?

[2:11:50] captain_khyzan: ty was curious, normally i do around third but wasnt sure
[2:12:40] MrBlankk: Does towellie not have brez?
[2:12:53] Molvonos: They didnt have any brezs available
[2:12:58] Strifelol: No charges

[2:14:33] GingerGambit: nah capes
[2:14:43] DrakeDuude: ya and trinkets are still like 1 in 40 to get hahahaha
[2:15:04] Mostdangspy: @Towelliee necks are not for me. I've done like 12 M+ and not a neck. Its what I need to upgrade the most
[2:15:12] juicefermilk: my weekly was a trink thought that was bad lol
[2:15:12] Aquadriel: oh no KEKW

[3:36:49] Boggogroggo: quote WIRED:"The story is rooted in anti-Semitic tropes. The gameplay feels dated. The graphics feel like theyâre a couple generations behind. All the characters are one-dimensional. It doesnât stay true to the established lore. Every character feels like an off-brand version of the characters we know and love. Thereâs no sense of place. No magic, no heart. "

[3:38:56] Molvonos: Nah, it's definitely not a 1/10 score.
[3:38:56] zeiours: the author doesn't agree on JK basically, that's why
[3:39:00] Boggogroggo: Take into account, that this is based on one persons review
[3:39:02] Stixxerz: the honest reviews in my country give it between 8/10 to 10/10
[3:39:04] id_invaded__: so they get clicks simple as that
[3:39:05] 91Niki: @Towelliee that rating is someone who can't set personal feelings aside
[3:39:06] Heero_Effect: I give that game an 8/10 and Iâm not a potter head

[4:23:14] Synaerio: @Synaerio Fated raids are not the same
[4:23:23] shimwood: You can still use mousover macros
[4:23:26] 91Niki: The "someone else will get that" mentality is what causes the most wipes in wow
[4:23:32] Molvonos: @Synaerio They're as close as you're ever going to get.
[4:24:03] profxjojo: You should have done my COS 20 :P
[4:24:06] Synaerio: Poor attempt at making it happen, 0 scaling

[4:25:32] Snabido: yeah, roof collapsing LUL
[4:25:33] shale93: aka get buff when you clear
[4:25:43] justi_86: I'll be ok with no seasonal affix maybe range could actually cast something lol
[4:26:27] thebakeriscomingforu: hm, S2 affix will probably be something "earth" related since those other primal dragons are released?
[4:27:04] xghostyyx: They baited peoples greed so hard haha

[4:30:49] mmrghost7: already hate it
[4:30:51] Texas_Mizfit: 3 mini adds in dungeons
[4:31:15] Sediz: earth wind and fire , should only been those 3! Sountrack would been all their hits looping =P

[4:31:43] mmrghost7: hope *
[4:31:46] Texas_Mizfit: hope its not like prideful add comes out at certain %
[4:32:03] thebakeriscomingforu: the last season of BFA was interesting with adds and portals
[4:33:25] metavahn231: season 2 should be infinitely better just because we start with that dang catalyst no more tier fomo
[4:33:48] Snabido: reaping?
[4:33:56] Nokterian: Good morning to you @Towelliee hope you're doing well! towComfy

[4:38:27] canniik: I was trying to find a Hershey's cookies and cream chocolate bar at the airport last week but couldn't find one for the life of me. Turns out they only sell plane chocolate
[4:38:52] reeepas: I always wanted to run 5 of my characters in a dungeon obviously can't do that but AI can
[4:39:11] Molvonos: Those would be considered bots as far as ToS is concerned.
[4:39:16] Molvonos: And third party software
[4:39:33] reeepas: same account
[4:39:44] Molvonos: Wouldn't matter
[4:40:02] captain_khyzan: yea still automated play
[4:40:49] captain_khyzan: blizz rule to beat multibox and bots is u have to push each key on each char... no software can be involved
[4:41:04] reeepas: can bot's run 5 charactyers on the same account thought you need 5 accounts
[4:41:23] Molvonos: It's the whole 'Third party software' and 'automated gameplay' that's the issue.
[4:41:28] Molvonos: Not the number of accounts.
[4:43:18] Mecabeast: guildy just posted there was a call to arms for dps for heroic dungeons
[4:43:36] Molvonos: The only way you can multibox these days is you do everything manually.  If you have any software to broadcast clicks/inputs, it's against the rules.
[4:43:54] TommySeeker: season 2 affix will need to have a positive that it clears debuff just so brackenhollow is doable
[4:44:39] c0mmander_starscream: Slooty is still in Hogwart school

[4:44:49] c0mmander_starscream: Hogwarts
[4:44:54] captain_khyzan: yea bracken without the proper cleanse on healer gonna rough... kinda a silly mechanic cuz it locks certain healers out... well makes them less optimal
[4:45:01] kysurprise: Are Blood DKs good for Mythics?
[4:45:13] Molvonos: @captain_khyzan Alchemists and Shamen can pop open the cauldrons to clear diseases
[4:45:18] JFeezy__: vengeance was really strong and they kept hitting it with the nerf bat... still in a good spot though
[4:45:33] captain_khyzan: AA kinda does that with tree boss as well but atleast its just the 1 boss... not the whole dungeon
[4:45:34] Zomiin: How are brewmasters atm?
[4:45:34] Mecabeast: all the prot war nerfs were like slaps on the wrist
[4:45:46] c0mmander_starscream: yea

[4:46:52] xghostyyx: most amount of chads tho EZ
[4:46:57] Molvonos: @captain_khyzan I dunno about Alchemy not being popular.  There's one in every CoS i've seen and they're everywhere, to be honest.
[4:47:30] c0mmander_starscream: I wish I could beat up malfoy in Hogwarts
[4:47:56] captain_khyzan: true... but dps brains as alchemy to clear debuff... idk silly design either way
[4:48:00] Masqerader: the mythical dps satchel is back for heroic dungeons
[4:48:32] sourc3r3r: nick mercs went gurthen hunt well lol
