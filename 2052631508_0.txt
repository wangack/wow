[0:29:18] ImPlutooo: Wish we saw some hunters
[0:29:22] Atlas62: nerf feral too right
[0:29:23] parka_79: they should do a rotating class ban per series
[0:29:29] honsou2: problem with dk nerf is that they left rogue and dh alone
[0:29:34] honsou2: well rogue got a insignificant change
[0:29:39] wyldeshock: it should cost energy to stunlock
[0:29:50] Adolescents77: but rogues without cds are easy to kill
[0:30:02] wyldeshock: how they can 100-0 in a stunlock is absurd
[0:30:05] JBugaboo: GZ TODAY
[0:30:05] zachgamegodx: @adolescents77 nah
[0:30:30] venruki: about the same i think
[0:30:31] DentalDayum: you guys worried about the move tomorrow? or you think you can take that wizk shadow priest? :P
[0:30:31] gotham_kr: Maybe they make certain classes hard counter rogues. literally make it unplayable idk
[0:30:47] mayfire15: you cant really do it in pvp but in pve you can make it so adrenaline rush has 0 CD

[0:35:39] memil141: awc today bro
[0:35:42] memil141: ?

[0:40:12] terranapart: was seeing ring of fire hit for 14K (5K absorbed)
[0:40:14] audovic: LUL
[0:40:17] Raikubest: arcane is just weird design its so hard go say, vs pet comps it feels insane and vs non pet comps when u cant freecast it feels kinda bad
[0:40:23] Raikubest: to*

[0:41:38] Sleepysevenz: cdew is classic rogue status
[0:42:15] brewtank: @cdewx what do u think about the game after all the hp changes etc? dmg feels a lil high atm still?
[0:42:17] middlebeach: try feral druid.
[0:42:26] chrisiirc: Dps is so easy compared to heals it's wild

[0:44:36] Snohconez: its slot machine
[0:44:40] leeka: WW for me, every time they spin i die
[0:44:41] hipsterdufus: people used to complain when the game was too scripted things could only die in cooldowns
[0:44:56] aod0311x: im having a hard time having fun in the game. the crazy amount of cc, the button bloat, the peels and defensive cds. games take forever and doing damage doesnt even feel fun when it takes 10 mins to kill anyone
[0:44:56] middlebeach: you wont play feral?
[0:45:03] Fixit_cat: Afflock when

[0:52:21] venruki: dont think so
[0:52:23] venruki: just arcane spells
