[5:52:11] snakepliskiin: pepeD
[5:52:16] dronder500: Auction house is like 35 silver per stack. Not worth the effort, just vendor

[5:52:47] Natasi01: he probably ment from scraps
[5:53:02] Brad_Chadson: yeah you can allways convert to the next tier of leather
[5:53:14] MrCtrlAlt: AH prices are pretty low cuz everyone uses skinning while lvling to get low effort gold, you're prob better off vendoring
[5:53:17] jahooney: you lose money on conversions because of how many leather it costs
[5:53:20] TANOMALOUS: @Woozie_9 im not gonna steal it

[5:53:57] dronder500: @JakenbakeLIVE The conversion is not worth. You lose money
[5:54:03] MeZoomer: You can stack your healtpotions to stacks of 5 btw
[5:54:08] overlord82: how bad is alliance warlock pvp?
[5:54:09] keybladeguy: like youtube fred?
[5:54:09] ZevenSins: Yes but mostly for special recipe
[5:54:17] dronder500: @JakenbakeLIVE you're gonna lose like 50% money by converting. You need 6 heavy leather per thick. 1 heavy is 1s50c, 1 thick is 6s
[5:54:20] DiscreetBinger: jake get the addon auctioneer, shows auction prices for items
[5:54:27] Soot30: What is the song name?
