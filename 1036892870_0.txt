[1:40:41] D3m0nHunt3r666: you have to kill the lich in wpl
[1:40:46] Ulfinator: You guys act like there’s an huge update.. relax Jesus
[1:40:53] CaptainJoeyNY: KSM?
[1:40:53] CabinetMoose: It wouldn't be that bad if the rewards for dungeons weren't absolute dogshit already anyways
[1:40:54] ThatTuesdayGuy: tried killing Araj yesterday 4 times for the key quest @towelliee never got it to work
[1:40:55] Atruis_: The people moaning on twitter prob sped things up too.
[1:40:59] smokingcactus: You have to do atleast a 10 man raid to finish it also @Towelliee
[1:41:10] TheLoho: KSM is fine, it's the reward that's terrible for season 2. @Towelliee
[1:41:10] CabinetMoose: It's still 2x the work for a recolored mount
[1:41:17] rocthenite: wowhead is on par with the sun
[1:41:18] thrakan84: which is honestly kind of nice
[1:41:18] thiccsushi: Doing a 15 on fort or tyrannical isn't even bad once you get heroic lvl gear
[1:41:25] CaptainJoeyNY: @ThatTuesdayGuy  I find more often that not, addons fuck up quest items. shut off your addons, check your inventory
[1:41:28] swordart_19: Just get good baddies, rewards are crap
[1:41:28] BustaphaJones: @Towelliee where'd you get those shelves in the back?
[1:41:32] CabinetMoose: I mean they've only had a fucking year to get this shit figured out
[1:41:33] rocthenite: but just in time for asmon to whrine and get more donations
[1:41:33] IianaDRK: my worry is that the ability to upgrade dungeon drops with valor will require 16 dungeons at 15 instead of just 8
[1:41:37] Yagr6: but why should we have to do both for it to even out? who asked for this?
[1:41:46] thrakan84: reskin doesn't hurt me too much since I'm unlikely to get S1 but I can understand people being upset
[1:41:47] rocthenite: wowehead is killing wow like bellalar and otk

[1:41:51] A_New_Challenger: A_New_Challenger subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:41:57] maniac_nd: all rewards have been reskins ever since glad drakes in BC.  KSM was a big achievement if you were pugging at the beginning of season, not sure why make it longer and more arduous
[1:42:09] Taibe: True
[1:42:18] Broomba: i will
[1:42:22] grumpy_1969: @Towelliee  Where do I pick up the quest for the Scholomance key quest?
[1:42:22] EthicalHermit: Its your guild, make it the way you want
[1:42:25] GameWithDerp: seperating definately sucks for general flow of conversation imo -- but not a ton of level 1 alts
[1:42:25] Kinghorn: isnt the main guild almost at capacity
[1:42:30] mmrghost7: so far i have not seen anything good enough to brings me back to 9.1 , not that bit of a fan of sylvanas
[1:42:33] saltychickenbiscuit: the GreenWall addon will help with that
[1:42:39] foxdie889: What server are you on?
[1:42:39] GameWithDerp: real playable alts should be allowed in
[1:42:50] silodin: Oof
[1:42:51] NovaSun84: We got quite a few people not following the "only 2" rule atm though.
[1:42:52] Maroleb: LUL
[1:42:52] rhodeos_: wheres the poll?
[1:42:55] ezpiron_tv: @Towelliee type /ginfo and you can see how many "solo" people there is
[1:42:56] Broomba: @towelliee HS guild -- main and 1 alt and then an alt guild where you can have 2-3 alts in it
[1:42:56] GameWithDerp: bank alts and curry whores shouldn't be imo
[1:42:59] MattOriginal: Green Wall makes multi guilds easy
[1:43:00] davysaurus: I heard Towelliee is bliz

[1:45:01] toobaked1987: @Towelliee Preach said we havent seen 4 test in a week since MoP, which means the patch is very soon. Do you agree or think late July?
[1:45:13] rocthenite: wowhead should be shut down
[1:45:20] Chiphazzord: swifty does everything  but raidnis lower on his prio
[1:45:21] Ballavar: my poor 3yr old keeps gettin sick, rough day mate

[4:32:14] sh1asurprise: @RerouteToHell But dont we need to kill Sylvanas twice? Her physcial/undead bottom and her soul because when we kill her she just gets sent to the Shadowlands anyway right?
[4:32:18] Apokolipz: so if  uther soul was shattered into 2   one in  frostmorne  and one in the shadowlands     what if  sylvannas real soul is in the peices of frostmourne ?

[4:50:37] Ballavar: hard to step down when you got those
[4:50:39] BadLebowski: beyer dymanics are industry standard for a reason
[4:50:42] Shurn_82: the sounds not even close to real good headphones
[4:50:42] Kman3107: I so freaking agree lol
[4:50:47] Broomba: @towelliee what did sloot say about that game is has been playing?
[4:50:47] BadLebowski: I used the 880's and they rock
[4:50:51] Ballavar: well the newer ones have mics on em
[4:50:53] Artivicii: @bloodyreapr just double checked, orc has 5% pet dmg, might be worth going orc for pve! lol
[4:50:57] Alt_slash: Things in my ears bug me after awhile
[4:50:59] Maldre: the airpods can sort of be open
[4:51:08] Ballavar: so you lose no sound within x feet on some ear buds
[4:51:25] DryR: Aftershokz are great open ear for a call headset
[4:51:27] BadLebowski: open back headphones are much better for your ears in general
[4:51:33] nightmayor12: Beyerdynamic ear buds
[4:51:35] Shrenko: Chivalry 2 is amazing Im dying of laughter
[4:51:35] DryR: but they are all treble, no bass
[4:51:36] Kneckt: AirPods Pro u cn

[4:51:41] Ballavar: the galaxy buds, give a really cool set up for that
[4:51:44] Artivicii: @bloodyreapr the only benefit for undead warlock is tanking illidan with the extra shadow resist. all their racials are mostly pvp
[4:51:45] TheUnknowing: i just dont like ear buds tbh
[4:51:46] CapTV8: my Samsung Buds let you hear external noise
[4:51:51] Ballavar: its full sound but no loss around you
[4:51:54] fartgobbler69_: must be nice
[4:52:04] Shurn_82: yea the sounds quality for full depth sound is not possible on in ear (the size of them is just not viable to get the full range of sound)
[4:52:12] biirrd: top end earbuds can do that.. they have a mic on them, so they let you hear the sound around you
[4:52:16] rhodeos_: damn hyperx was WoD?
[4:52:25] chrslp: I have a mix of Logitech and Razer
[4:52:27] kokochris: I never liked the feeling of earbuds myself.

[4:52:59] Nokterian: Logitech G502 Hero is such fantastic mouse
[4:53:04] fartgobbler69_: razer headset is the most comfortable and great sound as well
[4:53:06] 91Niki: @Towelliee Even with transparency mode, earbuds feels weird when you talk, kinda like closed headset. I personally don't like it. I always keep one earbud out when talking to people on my earbuds

[5:23:22] Colt_Engineer: this is going to be entertaining
[5:23:23] Carahail: so prolly a Monk DH tank fight
[5:23:25] yunggluten: why would you ever bring melee to this fight? 2 tanks, 5 healers, 13 ranged on mythic
[5:23:27] nightmayor12: So the only melee class for this fight is WW
[5:23:28] chukudu: my name is Sylvanas Allen, I'm the fastest banshee alive
[5:23:29] ZIKERZ: finally a boss that doe not walk or move slow
[5:23:29] shimwood: Maybe you should do this on LFR until you git gud Kappa
[5:23:32] hisdue: this is why she drops a bow
[5:23:33] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: csgo with sylvanas would be pog Kappa Kappa  Kappa
[5:23:37] Worgenrunt01: melee slootKEKW

[5:23:57] Gothbrud: SHe should drop a melee weapon as a participation trophy Kappa
[5:24:02] n1cfreetaco: can range stack close to boss? @towelliee
[5:24:03] clearcmos: I heard her hitbox is huge (might be in journal?) and melee are supposed to be able to hit her while she jumps around
[5:24:09] cabalish: ''windrunner''
[5:24:13] nightmayor12: why doesnt the hunter just trap her??
[5:24:14] SavageCheez: She drank a tub of clickbait
[5:24:18] MasqureMan: Maybe she’s supposed to have set points that she jumps between
[5:24:25] drmabusee: she is called windrunner for a reason. not slowwalker
[5:24:28] zenity360: is there any mechanic that makes it so you can be close to each other? or do the chains hit everyone that is in a radius? If so id say a heavy stack is gonna be needed
[5:24:33] dutchie76: boring room she is in eh?
[5:24:35] ZIKERZ: how does click bait g fuel taste
[5:24:36] CardinalTX: Sylvanas has gone into, Fuck you melee phase!

[5:28:50] manbulance_: the old lucky 88
[5:28:59] delsea: its trash man and boring
[5:29:01] purrfecto: maybe stack for chains to drop then move away?
[5:29:03] DanielTheMedic: is she the last boss?

[5:29:33] Yagr6: just reroll and cast convoke
[5:29:37] Vasciras: it's not supposed to be hell for melee, you're supposed to be able to hit her from where she casts windrunner. check the journal
[5:29:41] Vivelli: frankly its an issue of skill
[5:30:07] Armdel: I see reports that her hitbox stays in place even when she jumps away
[5:30:14] Ballavar: if the players on bottom, just dps'd more to be on top. then there would be no imbalance - blizzards view on balancing.
[5:30:18] CodyKane: lol lula just got the deflector from UBRS
[5:30:28] portugaz_d_ace: @Towelliee her hit box doesn't move when she bounces around

[5:32:16] flyingmachin3: 80% lets go!
[5:32:23] A_Klimas: wailing arrow cleanses the bleed
[5:32:26] nightmayor12: the guy with the open mic is going to drive me insane
[5:32:36] A_Klimas: or domination?
[5:32:47] A_Klimas: one of em get rid of the bleed
[5:32:50] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: " Domination Chains: Sylvanas fires several salvos of Domination Arrows at targeted locations, inflicting 30 Shadow damage to enemies within 6 yards, then chains players to those that remain. These chains pull players inflicting 1652 Shadow damage every second and increasing the speed at which players are pulled by 30% until defeated. This effect stacks and removes Barbed Arrow from targets."
[5:32:56] Kaykerrs: @lulaboo how you doing
[5:33:00] A_Klimas: domination not ewailing
[5:33:03] Captain_Foopy: cant you just stack to bait the arrows in one spot

[5:56:19] BlinkHeals: @DoctorPetter all leggos can be multiple different ilvlv

[6:00:14] Holb__: How long as she been up for testing?
[6:00:15] H0dun: No way I'm playing Melee this tier lmao
[6:00:17] Rakim88: its funny tho to remove the arrow debuff, u need to get chained. so when it spawns a sec before it picks its closest target u need to make it select u if u want to remove the debuff LUL stupid shit
[6:00:33] a_valentine_story: honestly i hope they back burner sylvanas for a few expansions... a new antagonist would be nice
[6:00:50] mmrghost7: imagine thinking u can beat my queen
[6:00:57] Cardenarcc: I think this might be the fight that puts MW back on the map @Towelliee KEKW
[6:01:05] nolorand: @deedeeshark2 agree
[6:01:06] ashlan04: @deedeeshark2 like dark anduin ? :D
[6:01:10] Armdel: this will almost certainly be the "end" of her story line.
[6:01:25] Armdel: at least as a villain
[6:01:29] a_valentine_story: or god forbid write a new charecter lol
[6:01:47] Rakim88: watching p2 on this is fight is so stupid LUL
[6:01:52] Rakim88: like why blizz
[6:02:01] Eternya1999: I think the banshe queen will die and sylvanas will live
[6:02:10] a_valentine_story: the new villian is blizzard itself and you can only beat them with titan forging and micro transactions
[6:02:23] a_valentine_story: titan forged micro transactions
[6:02:45] nolorand: bc of wc3, lich king will always be the main antagonist for me even if hes dead lol

[6:06:00] Armdel: the top guilds who don't stream their attempts could be getting pretty far
[6:06:00] ashlan04: they didt told you but they want only P1 testing :D
[6:06:16] NVbrutal: dont even think they have p3 in ptr atm lol every stream i have seen that almost got out of p2 whole raid just crashes

[6:06:27] torridcheese3: maybe the later phases are better

[6:29:31] Zavier420: That was pretty much the same result as Kel from the original Naxx
[6:29:52] allisonkielle: cough cough this arena looks overly similar to abyss commander sivarras
[6:29:52] nolorand: what a unit yea
[6:30:06] Jacobo204: eeeewwwwww retail
[6:31:01] Zavier420: I wonder if Kel'Thuzad is still loyal to Arthas
[6:31:15] Ballavar: its stated hes loayal to the power of arthas
[6:31:16] Ballavar: so the jailer
[6:31:37] torridcheese3: Looks like I'm leveling my boomkin lol
[6:31:39] Ballavar: and there is more and more evidence that arthas was never in control past the helm being placed on
[6:32:13] ChimpanQ: is it still heavy melee unfriendly?

[6:32:43] 1andonlyCidwar: loving the beard Towelliee
[6:32:44] Zavier420: @Ballavar So if Arthas is somehow redeemed he wouldn't be right?
[6:32:44] AtomicHeartSon: We've killed KT like seven times
[6:33:05] pixxelina: but he simply will not die :p
[6:33:05] Ballavar: if arthas is redeemd who wouldnt be right?
[6:33:47] Zavier420: Kel wouldn't have any loyalty to Arthas anymore
[6:34:06] yunggluten: KT's new model looks sooooooo good
[6:34:17] rovermike: where is Sparty?
[6:34:49] Ballavar: thats been awhile mate @rovermike

[6:35:36] rovermike: for sure
[6:35:38] Ballavar: yea it was a think around bfa i think - i missed it too cuz....bfa
[6:35:48] Fatherfirst: anyone in chat recommend the most fun solo class for an old guy with shitty internet
[6:35:56] rovermike: got ya thanks
[6:36:18] Ballavar: what classic or retail @Fatherfirst

[6:36:32] Fatherfirst: @ballavar retail
[6:36:50] myamoray: @Fatherfirst BM hunter is good for solo, your pet can hold aggro and does decent dmg for solo play
[6:37:05] Ballavar: druids have always been my fav for solo - you can tank almost anything and run off and heal should you need. and if that dosent work you can quickly kill packs of adds in boomy
[6:37:17] Ballavar: other than druid i say hunter
[6:37:39] Artivicii: is this the 3rd or 4th time we've seen a KT fight?
[6:37:49] myamoray: plus druid can prowl, which is awesome, but hunter can FD to drop aggro

[6:38:16] IianaDRK: 60 naxx, 80 naxx and this
[6:38:16] Ballavar: 4 in game's
[6:38:22] Fatherfirst: I will try druid. I am a BM hunter right now but just doesn't seem to suit me
[6:38:35] myamoray: @Fatherfirst try them both out and see which feels best for your playstyle
[6:38:49] myamoray: yep, that's a good idea
[6:38:58] Ballavar: and with druid you save so much time not casting a mount /s

[6:39:06] yunggluten: @Fatherfirst are you talking about for 9.1 or for TBC?
[6:39:11] Ballavar: thats my justification of playing one the last 16 or so years lol
[6:39:12] doobie077: is this the new raid ?
[6:39:16] Fatherfirst: 9.1
[6:39:17] myamoray: we all have different playstyles and finding the one you enjoy is critical imo to the game being fun!
[6:39:22] yunggluten: got it
[6:39:30] ThaOriginalGamester: was there a lore reason why we got 80 Naxx?
[6:39:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:39:36] Ballavar: yes
[6:39:46] theoneeleven: This fight looks sooo much better than Sylvanas currently
[6:40:10] Fatherfirst: does druid have a complicated rotation
[6:40:11] Ballavar: kt is a lich - we never broke phylactery. lk woke from slumber and sent kt to weaken azeroths forces in the pre-patchj
[6:40:16] Ballavar: so we killed him for it in his raid
[6:40:28] doobie077: LUL
[6:40:29] ThaOriginalGamester: I didn't start paying attention to wow Lore until BFA. i've got a lot of catching up to do LUL
[6:40:31] nolorand: yea ranged attack or close melee is a huge difference to start
[6:40:37] ThaOriginalGamester: Thanks @Ballavar
[6:40:37] maccaruso: Pepega!
[6:40:38] Biggum34: Your pc is lagging
[6:40:45] Ballavar: wow lore is easier for me than IRL - and i kinda hate that?
[6:40:52] ThaOriginalGamester: I love Les he's so savage

[6:49:55] itsChiliiii: this fight looks fun

[6:54:38] Ardailec: Weird. I didn't think they'd make that human shaped
[6:54:42] yunggluten: thats why when you kill a Lich's phylactery they're gone for good

[6:56:38] Keyastaron_: is that mythic LUL hes melting
[6:56:39] Ardailec: KT sure is quiet compared to Sylvanas. is his V.O NYI?
