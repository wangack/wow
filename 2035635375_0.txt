[0:21:08] Luthxx: @traymann84 NFT stands for 'non-fungible token'. Non-fungible means that something is unique and can't be replaced. By contrast, physical money and cryptocurrencies are fungible, which means they can be traded or exchanged for one another. Every NFT contains a digital signature which makes each one unique.

[0:47:12] richard_pov: Hey man, whats that wallpaper?
[0:47:15] Taytor: It's complicated. You can evict them
[0:47:15] richard_pov: ITS SICK AF

[0:47:17] optiikalbs: isnt it like a year? they have to be there for a year?
[0:47:18] Cuore22: Yep it's tragic.

[0:47:41] cantsaypenguin: THEY"RE ALMOST ALWAYS A MYTH
[0:47:41] sednajoan: he can be evicted... just a lot of hoops to go through first... and money
[0:47:42] dsiftmagus: @rizuel23 its not legal in spain but very hard for authority to move them out
[0:47:43] Keecksi: for aoe stops?
[0:47:44] ohfoeshow: it took a restraining order to get evict a guy that was renting a room with us
[0:47:45] fronkacean: "i touched it first"
[0:47:46] ciggyman: i mean if i had the money to move sounds like id move, sounds ugly over there brother
[0:47:46] nilachip: false you can evict them
[0:47:47] suclarberg: imagine just a crackhead living in your home and you cant get rid of em lmoa
[0:47:47] Nuaada: if she rents the apartment to a new tenant...the new tenant has more rights than a squatter
[0:47:47] Multivaccro: If you don't give them milk and cookies then idk
[0:47:49] Viisionz74: Idk in mississippi the police tell us to respond 3 times of telling them to get off the property if they dont attain there 3 warnings your open to fire upon them
[0:47:50] dsiftmagus: but its not legal in spain its bit weird
[0:47:51] cantsaypenguin: But legal eviction is hard

[0:48:11] OG_Kawngi: its 5 years continuous
[0:48:12] murloc_oracle: but you have to prove they didnt live there for a long time
[0:48:13] Brohdin: Still crazy that you can just domination cap a whole ass house
[0:48:14] cantsaypenguin: and squatters lefts?
[0:48:18] lou_493: They need to be there for many years, without the property owner objecting to it at all
[0:48:22] LemmingsOCE: Would you consider moving or?
[0:48:23] PepikStep: it’s the ultimate finder keepers game
[0:48:32] ModestMewtwo21: @maximum there were some squatters who moved into a house at the end of my street after it’s owner passed away before their kids could sell it. they couldn’t get them to leave so they paid to have the house gassed for insects and told them they would gas them if they wouldn’t leave and they finally left
[0:48:41] LuciFeariUm: They just live in the guest bedroom closet for a year
[0:48:42] Squats3: @Maximum theres a big difference between being a "squatter" and just not paying rent. squatters are next to impossible to get rid of. if you dont pay your rent it takes a while to get you out, but its doable.
[0:48:42] Keecksi: @Maximum hey max i just watched ur video about "the drama" and im at the part where u talk about the weakaura u made... is there a chance to get that weakaura?
[0:48:44] ColdIceCreamMan: it is an old law that when you are living uncontested in a place for a long time that you can't get evicted by a "newly" appearing owner. but it get's perverted by some statutes that allows them to get ownership after some time
[0:48:46] kelly_mac06: there is an interesting Air BnB case in California where the renter claimed adverse possession over a place from the Air BnB thing
[0:48:49] memehoteplol: adverse possession is a thing in every jurisdiction
[0:48:56] Nox1o: not the airbnb guy that wont leave we often are lead to believe then
[0:48:57] memehoteplol: texas, cali, etc.
[0:49:02] roookai: they're not considered a squatter because they were originally a tenant. eviction process is different.
[0:49:06] smolderdaddyuwu: @maximum there were some squatters who moved into a house at the end of my street after it’s owner passed away before their kids could sell it. they couldn’t get them to leave so they paid to have the house gassed for insects and told them they would gas them if they wouldn’t leave and they finally left
[0:49:11] ColdIceCreamMan: some counties you can get squatters rights after like 6 month or so
[0:49:12] cheados: adverse possesssion is a funny legal doctrine
[0:49:16] thecajuncommie: @memehoteplol in Louisiana we call it acquisitive prescription
[0:49:19] Squats3: cranking it
[0:49:19] Taytor: He's getting his paycheck
[0:49:19] certose: Yeah, it's an hour and 12 mins LOL

[0:57:21] lostamongliars: I just can't see follower dungeons preparing you for "actual" healing though
[0:57:25] Konijn246: yes but moving to one side while casting abilities to the other is so good though
[0:57:26] LemmingsOCE: Some people use w to move in POE
[0:57:30] lathander557: WASD for camera, click for abilities and movement is de wae
[0:57:31] MortsyFGC: Good point, I should be a clicker
[0:57:33] ungnyaa: even proving grounds would be miles better to learn something
[0:57:35] Nox1o: only reason i can think of is ranged abilites on left click being scuffed to bind
[0:57:39] surpriseparty20: I've played League for so many years clicking to move felt natural
[0:57:40] swisher_szn: well its probably just for a dungeon environment to get used to keybinds
[0:57:41] polygoncoke: I wish they would do Follower dungeons for old content so you could do the story easily
[0:57:43] Madgeneto: @meatseekor diablo
[0:57:44] Riot_Blacktimus: I mean you do the same in WoW but the top-down perspective makes a big difference
[0:57:44] sukoWoW: its okay to not have every game mechanically work the exact same way
[0:57:57] Basic_3: Low pressure content
[0:58:04] Brohdin: Follower mode is story mode
[0:58:06] Yagr6: use it to level in new expansion
[0:58:07] Jack_the_Dipper: @ungnyaa you wont learn if the whole party blasts through a dungeon
[0:58:13] laurent94: the fact that fresh level 70 can jump into +2 keys at 420-440 ilvl, says something about the need of follower dungeons, normal, and hc
[0:58:14] proxiez03: gotta learn your rotation somewhere
[0:58:17] GnasherReign: it just get you familiar with the dungeons instead of just going in with randoms and not knowing where to go and stuff.
[0:58:23] Munihihin: I do
[0:58:23] gdtomii: Combat is S tier in WoW
[0:58:24] tehKrazeee: I love to run 20s and raid with my guild, but I also sometimes don't want to deal with other humans for a bit
[0:58:29] GnasherReign: i mean think about dawn there's ppl that still dont know the layout
[0:58:31] Eddie_iwnl: why cant WoW have player housing lets be honest, its a long time overdue
[0:58:31] 3V3R357: what if those followers learn from infinite recorded dungs and eventually get so fkin good that you play MDI finals vs them
[0:58:31] Riot_Blacktimus: this has been a good year for SP games
[0:58:32] Baskkov: I am the opposite I cant force myself to play single player
[0:58:35] Remso81: Max, my guild got World worst mythic Council kill, very proud of us.
[0:58:38] Marovia: anxiety people represents
[0:58:39] OG_Kawngi: i played FF14 mostly single player
[0:58:40] larkhill: a lot of people just have too much anxiety to even join a normal dungeon. follower dungeons r great for them
[0:58:40] zugsmcghee: @Maximum one of my guildmates thinks follower dungeons are bad because it will lead to players messing up their 21 keys because they didn't learn the dungeons they just did follower dungeons for gear.
[0:58:43] lathander557: heroid raiding with bots when
[0:58:48] ProfessorPete: is liquid doing monday night mythic raids with alts anytime soon?
[0:59:08] ungnyaa: just use the lfg tool and you're already playing with fruit vendors
[0:59:12] ThisIzD: lmao
[0:59:13] Karkesis: yeah that's an awful take
[0:59:13] mrbroonis: the followers need a better route in the dungeons i just tried and it was terrible
[0:59:14] Madgeneto: it's useful for dps alts for the random heroic dungeons weekly
[0:59:15] prugar: its only normal dungeons, what gear?
[0:59:16] ItsShiraz: i disappoint people irl, i dont want to disappoint ppl in video games too. i just wanna vibe alone in my silly lil game world.
[0:59:17] certose: That's a BBQ'd take
[0:59:18] infraxtion: thats a wild take
[0:59:20] Basic_3: @zugsmcghee So one of your guildmates is detached from reality.
[0:59:22] zugsmcghee: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID
[0:59:23] PinenippleGaming: My followers vote kicked me out of the dungeon
[0:59:27] metel7: wait do follower dungeons even get good gear?
[0:59:27] braaahhh: the venn diagram of players using follower dungeons and 21 keys is two seperate circles KEKW
[0:59:29] goombacci: based
[0:59:29] Munihihin: very true lol
[0:59:30] Jack_the_Dipper: No BS. You dont learn a dungeon if you party blasts through ha dungeon
[0:59:31] OG_Kawngi: none of that person's take makes any sense
[0:59:32] nemziac: only for normal anyways
[0:59:35] Razzlee: There are also a lot of player that doesnt want to pug so they would either do stuff when friends/guildies are online and do a lot of single player stuff alone when they don't have people online to play with
[0:59:45] infraxtion: there is nothing learned in heroic or normal at this point since everything melts
[0:59:46] Khorvan: you'll learn more about the dungeons from follower dungeons than from normal LFG anyway
[0:59:47] zugsmcghee: @Basic_3 yeah he goes "someone in an 18 told me to fuck myself when I said he needs to kick stuff so follower dungeons are bad"
[0:59:49] leubinator: farming lvling gear in followerdungeons to jump right into world first keys easy
[0:59:49] Maldre: also imagine not being able to carry a 21
[0:59:50] foxsunalpha: DRUNK RAID PARTY soon. We need to throw one @Maximum Get me back in WoW. I took a break for a month now.
[0:59:50] fokare: I don't think that's true for new players, you can grow through trying shit in a low stakes environment (even lower than random normals)
[0:59:51] Nox1o: idk, players struggling in 21s could be interested in follower dungeons KEKW
[0:59:57] gunshinsora: that take is just som1 hating for the sake of hating, very common nowadays in the gaming community it feels bad
[1:00:09] ungnyaa: that's not true tho i'm in valdrakken can hover people and literally 90% of the ppl there have a 20+ timed
[1:00:21] polygoncoke: Noooo but they are gonna annoy people farming 11’s
[1:00:21] AoPsyke: The terminally online
[1:00:25] Yagr6: classic players
[1:00:28] TirrinWoW: the worst
[1:00:39] Maldre: oh yeah like call of duty
[1:00:40] gunshinsora: it is
[1:00:41] goombacci: yes

[1:00:43] gretriku: ye
[1:00:45] larkhill: yes
[1:00:46] Jack_the_Dipper: Angry Adny's
[1:00:47] nemziac: they are jealous they cant have fun playing the game they used to love so dearly
[1:00:47] Basic_3: Yes
[1:00:50] darthhelmett: yes
[1:00:50] gunshinsora: u can buy it standalone
[1:00:50] braaahhh: in the wow tab
[1:00:54] larkhill: its in the wow specific one
[1:00:56] Sumtinwon: the what? raid ready boost never heard that since vanilla
[1:00:57] meatseekor: imagine complainoing about 424 ilvl boost gear.. then saying they gonna sell heroic acheivements soon KEKW
[1:00:57] ProfessorPete: asmonbald
[1:01:00] meatseekor: who was that clown
[1:01:02] Sumtinwon: lol
[1:01:03] Nox1o: love how asmon etc said this is buying raid gear, its literally worse than sq gear
[1:01:06] Nox1o: wq*
[1:01:08] lathander557: 424 ain't ready for SHIT
[1:01:09] thenateo2: 424 Poh
[1:01:11] AbieCherry: it was
[1:01:11] thenateo2: Pog
[1:01:12] AbieCherry: there
[1:01:12] larkhill: its like 424 gear. they mean LFR raid
[1:01:14] Guffels: thtas lfr ilvl
[1:01:15] ItchY_val: LFR raid yeah
[1:01:22] braaahhh: it's 424 because that's the minimum to queue LFR
[1:01:23] PeepoCray: thats not even aberrus gear
[1:01:23] gunshinsora: som1's reaction to this lvl 70 424 gear was, well next give us cutting edge for 50$
[1:01:25] fenoxisyra: and its not ever fucking tierset
[1:01:27] certose: @larkhill exactly
[1:01:30] caveman2x: i got my paladin from 400 to 430 in like 1 hour
[1:01:31] Yagr6: szn 1 gear
[1:01:32] Archmage_Michael: It's for LFR
[1:01:34] Chappypappy1: 424 takes like 30 minutes to get on fresh 70
[1:01:35] gunshinsora: 424 is for LFR
[1:01:36] GnasherReign: it just takes you straight into lfr
[1:01:36] Madgeneto: it's teh requirement for lfr
[1:01:39] pnguinwow: i just started an alt and its 440 and i feel like an absolute rat
[1:01:40] Moodann36: 424 is min for LFR
[1:01:43] Vigilnace: LFR ready
[1:01:43] ciggyman: 424 is entry for lfr
[1:01:44] Basic_3: It saves you from buying green BoEs
[1:01:46] Sanderbrakstad: raid finder
[1:01:47] Lenzoface: 424 is bare minimum ilvl for uqeing LFR
[1:01:47] Nox1o: insta redneck KEKW
[1:01:47] 3V3R357: they made it LFR ready since that's the ilvl req
[1:01:49] Cmbb: KKona
[1:01:49] Slapsstick: you can go straight into LFR is what it means but yeah people are dumb
[1:01:49] fokare: @ungnyaa 15.1% of raider io profiles have all dungeons timed at +20, 32.2% have all 15s, 47.7% have all 10s
[1:01:51] sleepytime783: 424 requirement for LFR lol
[1:01:54] Sarynrae: no troll i took my 424 s2 boost to 476 without having pve'd since BFA
[1:01:55] Pokects: sounded just like then lmao
[1:01:58] Brohdin: You're not getting onto normal raid with that gear lmao
[1:01:58] Madgeneto: @Chappypappy1 not from fresh 70
[1:02:00] Brotholomew13: 424 is for queing LFR
[1:02:01] JustJoshin____: it’s lfr min gear for god’s sake lmao
[1:02:01] Xulu_: Twitter got the one-guyed on this though
[1:02:02] meatseekor: clown
[1:02:03] vilfork: KKona

[1:02:10] ciggyman: KKona
[1:02:13] peanutz413: i hate thos people, always hating but they dont even play the game
[1:02:14] untouchabletwo: trash gear, guess it's for returning players, they give nearly full rep too.
[1:02:21] ItchY_val: BASED
[1:02:22] abc1shady: 424 means you can q for lfr I guess
[1:02:25] Sumtinwon: bro, word on!
[1:02:27] ciggyman: BASED
[1:02:29] leubinator: hell yeah back to 2009 it is
[1:02:30] N0vaOmega: Boomer nostalgia
[1:02:33] kadashy1: those people might honestly be unironically gatekeeping LFR to be honest

[1:02:37] Lenzoface: Tru
[1:02:37] Pokects: based
[1:02:37] Sarynrae: no troll i took my 424 s2 boost to 476 without having pve'd since BFA
[1:02:38] pokirane: baseg
[1:02:48] OG_Kawngi: isnt that half the reason classic exists, even though nobody will be able to relive that feeling
[1:02:48] trennyjr: trennyjr subscribed with Prime. 
[1:02:49] periphrase: people just love having shit to complain about, logic be damned
[1:02:49] lathander557: Those people can go play SoD like I have been, lul
[1:02:50] maiadabee: is ptr live?
[1:02:51] Tarnkek: I miss playing wow, but don't start up again in case I'm just chasing a nostalgia high
[1:02:54] Madgeneto: i dont think it's that deep
[1:02:56] lostamongliars: right now, especially when dreamsurge is in thaldrazsus, you can farm enough whelpling crests to craft all slots 447 in max one hour, and buy 437 trinkets from the AH.
[1:02:58] gunshinsora: yes yes, some ppl hate for the of hating... if u hate smtg so bad just leave it
[1:02:58] Brotholomew13: gatekeeping LFR lmao
[1:03:08] mammaofboyz: I don't miss the earlier ways too much. I remember waiting for over an hour to form a group in world chat.
[1:03:10] foxsunalpha: Alrighty @Maximum Im out. Be good bro. Hit me up.
[1:03:17] caveman2x: basically everyone on wow reddit and fourms .. full of people who dont even play the game but have a lot to say
[1:03:21] fokare: LUL it feels like they're stalking an ex-girlfriend they're obsessed with sometimes
[1:03:24] Nakastrio: thats so true. Life has gotten a lot busier personally so I can't grind the way I used to. I don't act like that but can see why certain people might
[1:03:28] fat_european0: @Maximum It's gaming in general tbh. Loads of those dudes will go on and watch content about how "modern games are dead"
[1:03:29] mammaofboyz: especially if your guild didn't get on till later
[1:03:29] Maldre: deranged behavior
[1:03:30] Staffosan: yea but that self reflection is already missing so
[1:03:30] Madgeneto: how do you understand which ones aren't playing?
[1:03:38] erdrick30: lol thats their audience t
[1:03:41] OG_Kawngi: people have a hard time accepting the thing they loved isn't for them anymore
[1:03:42] Brotholomew13: @fokare big tru
[1:03:42] Pokects: hate watching a video game
[1:03:49] erdrick30: they think they have to keep talkign about it
[1:04:02] splashz0r: i stalk-watch my ex-guild progress every weel KEKW
[1:04:02] surpriseparty20: Happens in every game . Ppl do it for League for COD . Legit every game
[1:04:02] bdpolarbear: hello
[1:04:04] lathander557: @Madgeneto Because if you read what they say you can just straight up tell they haven't been playing.
[1:04:04] ThisIzD: the only point asmon made about it that was logical was that he said if its a great thing and good for the game, why isnt just in the game. why do you have to buy it. While yea, but also i dont mind paying if goes to good development.
[1:04:18] camle1234: @Maximum What position do you play?

[1:04:56] ItchY_val: Do you play in a league or is it just shinny
[1:04:59] Madgeneto: @lathander557 i sometimes read some but they just sound stupid, not outdated
[1:05:06] Guffels: yeah its up
[1:05:07] Tweedleum1: Haha, I live in the future otherwise I'd be down
[1:05:10] Guffels: its good
[1:05:14] SirPikajew: TIndral kills don't matter til JB finally gets it
[1:05:15] erdrick30: this game is way better shape with mythic + and stuff then it was in the past. You wont recreate nostalgia
[1:05:15] Taytor: We went from 1st seed set to 22% boss dam in 1 night @Maximum

[1:08:54] sukoWoW: 0.12 despairge
[1:08:54] gwenmh: that's wild
[1:09:03] silent_tv1: 249 was the last us kill
[1:09:24] MVPBuster: jesus
[1:09:36] fokare: Does it say they spent 35 days on Tindral?
[1:09:37] infektyd: 16th is wwhen it dropped
[1:09:38] gretriku: sorting by fyrakk percent
[1:09:42] nick08_wow: @Maximum go to WCL it is sorted way better
[1:09:49] NotD4k: *** 󠀀
[1:09:51] MVPBuster: you can look up specific bosses @Maximum
[1:09:54] Dzor12: go to warcraftlogs progress tab yeah
[1:09:58] jobbw: all bosses filter?
[1:10:02] EppatTV: go on Tindral instead all bosses filter
[1:10:03] NotD4k: progress
[1:10:04] thenateo2: progress
[1:10:05] nick08_wow: progress
[1:10:08] Dzor12: Raids>Progress
[1:10:11] Lenzoface: wowprogress should work aswell
[1:10:16] yesnosomething: BuT pErCeNtAgE eQuAlS pRoGrEsS
[1:10:23] BANJOOFDEATH: its 62 since nerf @Maximum
[1:10:41] itsmiraix: 230 and onwards
[1:10:49] Dzor12: so 71
[1:10:52] NotD4k: @BANJOOFDEATH Dentge
[1:10:52] Basic_3: So 71 kills?
[1:10:54] gretriku: 71 kills in 24 hours
[1:10:57] Nox1o: solid 30% increase
[1:10:57] Brotholomew13: 80 guilds isn't that much..?
[1:11:03] ImYuishi: that means ghost gaming might kill it before 600 pulls!
[1:11:04] thenateo2: a ton
[1:11:04] gretriku: so 3 kills an hour
[1:11:05] Kapowzers: Me :)
[1:11:05] nick08_wow: 1000
[1:11:10] LuciFeariUm: thats what like 35%
[1:11:11] thenateo2: like 900 guilds on it
[1:11:15] nick08_wow: 500 kills by the end of the week at least
[1:11:17] PacoTacoMMMGood: my guild is about to be on it
[1:11:19] Yoitsnova: yea prob 1-2 weeks now
[1:11:22] Kapowzers: First night on Tindral last night, only got to 80% best pull
[1:11:22] fokare: There's 1200 kills on Smolderon
[1:11:25] Brotholomew13: :doubt:
[1:11:26] Nox1o: those guilds were probably all already in p3
[1:11:30] Yoitsnova: seed mechanic no longer exists
[1:11:32] yama_class: we jumped from p1 to p3 in 2h
[1:11:38] yelp26: We went from 28% best pull to kill in 4 pulls
[1:11:39] SavageFromSpace: @Nox1o nah i've seen p1 only guilds kill it in 1 day
[1:11:43] itsmiraix: idk, does it even feel rewarding now after being on it for so long and knowing you most likely killed it now because of a nerf and not because you got better?
[1:11:47] Papouzee: are there still hundreds of guildsd progressing tindral?
[1:11:48] Darklott: to be fair should it this late into the season not be like that? hasnt hall been full at this point in previous raids
[1:11:49] Kawatteruwow: its good because this season seems to be a short one
[1:11:58] Yoitsnova: @itsmiraix no it feels like shit :)
[1:11:59] OG_Kawngi: ALOO
[1:12:06] Blackeye1992: they got em
[1:12:06] Teepone: @Brotholomew13 reset is 24 hours ago ish
[1:12:08] herptyderptyqwerty: ALOO who dis
[1:12:10] squirebdd: Blizzard intervention
[1:12:11] LionButLeon: ALOO
[1:12:14] itsmiraix: I mean, def. good to down it but the thought behind it in general and the reason why you down it
[1:12:14] Nox1o: police requesting memes
[1:12:16] SicariusGTV: @Maximum do you think they will ever implement that you can fight the "un nerfed" boss? might be kinda sadge being really close to a kill when it gets nerfed to oblivion
[1:12:17] fokare: @itsmiraix Speaking from experience on Halondrus where we were like 2% off the kill when it got destroyed, no it doesn't.
[1:12:18] LuciFeariUm: the cops are calling
[1:12:20] LuciFeariUm: need more meemes
[1:12:24] gretriku: oh shit chat they caught the burglars
[1:12:30] 3MadOx: Tell you what tho we just started Fyrakk prog and that boss got HANDS
[1:12:38] Jack_the_Dipper: monkaS
[1:12:45] Madgeneto: car detailman requesting memes
[1:12:49] lathander557: Cops on the phone be like "We need to call Liquid Maximum"
[1:12:54] Nickystr1x: pup was hittin that itch HARD
[1:12:58] Almanes: hey buddy, did you release the time ways weak aura yet ?
[1:12:58] Brotholomew13: @Maximum About 1200 guilds have killed Smolderon, so like 900 guilds are on Tindral
[1:12:59] LuciFeariUm: ah the care detailman heard about the cop meme
[1:13:12] ishka422: what counts as the "un nerfed" boss?
[1:13:15] gretriku: i doubt they will, but it would be really cool if they did
[1:13:16] Darklott: but where would that stop since some bosses literally werent killable like raz
[1:13:16] Thdlock: lost ark literally has that for the alst big raid they did
[1:13:17] swisher_szn: heroic anduin type beat
[1:13:22] Thdlock: YEP
[1:13:23] Codester_remix: feet SNIFFA
[1:13:26] leubinator: the old boss exists and ilvl scaling on ptr exists shouldn't be to hard to implement
[1:13:31] ishka422: because they nerf the bosses during the WF race
[1:13:34] Fletchster: Literally never happen lol
[1:13:38] Slapsstick: wow 2 idea
[1:13:38] ThisIzD: fetus strength?
[1:13:39] Jack_the_Dipper: Raid M+
[1:13:40] Bissenz: @Maximum would the ilvl be set to the ilvl the world first kill of that boss was?
[1:13:41] LuciFeariUm: @Darklott the idea would be to kill when it was killed in rwf
[1:13:55] fokare: Like 3 guilds in the world would do that on Fyrakk
[1:14:03] meatseekor: i think that sounds fun in practice but people would hate wiping. most gamers just want loot
[1:14:04] HypnosTheHero: @maximum I’m newer to wow and was curious if blizzard normally balances classes based on legendaries like fyrakk axe for example. Looking from the outside in it sounds like terrible balance. Thoughts?
[1:14:04] yelp26: So we started progress on Fyrakk today and I think it's the least fun I ever had as a healer. That dispell mechanic is so dogwater
[1:14:11] Basic_3: The +25% hp version of Tindral?
[1:14:15] Brotholomew13: Skyline 1k pulls lol
[1:14:16] Andychron: took us 320 pulls before most recent nerf, dont think we would kill prenerf
[1:14:25] thenateo2: @Basic_3 thats unkillable
[1:14:26] gwenmh: they made the shaman damage reduction talent increase damage taken i dont think it would be easy for them to implement
[1:14:29] bronzleaguehiro: what did they changed exactly just hp nerf ?
[1:14:30] ishka422: i think that would eb a good idea for a hall of fame replacement but im still confised as what counts as un nerfed
[1:14:31] PacoTacoMMMGood: what was the worst for you guys as far as prog?
[1:14:34] dejathoris: nobody would do that (or not enough to make it worth the dev time).  Imagine halondrus
[1:14:35] Kraave: Then we could get mad at all the guilds entering the raid early with low ilvl getting those first few kills RAGEY
[1:14:36] kelly_mac06: A friend's guild had 600k wipe on M Tindral pre nerf and the mental was just gone
[1:14:36] xdanielsooon: you’re not that good you guys raid 16 hours a day /s
[1:14:37] Raddasan: most guilds would burn out and quit the raid probably
[1:14:40] Nickystr1x: @Maximum then you guys could turbo grief by killing early bosses at piss low ilvl to lock in a low level cap for everyone else
[1:14:44] LionButLeon: xddShrug
[1:14:54] lizardo221: I wish Smolderon got another small nerf
[1:14:55] Nickystr1x: not saying you would but thatd be funny
[1:15:08] gretriku: how many guilds could kill the version of tindral you killed if you gave them 2000 pulls to do so
[1:15:13] thenateo2: dec 12 one
[1:15:14] fronkacean: thats exactly what i sound like when i write the titles
[1:15:20] xdanielsooon: @lizardo221 it did get nerfed and its already wasy
[1:15:21] LuciFeariUm: @Nickystr1x it wouldnt be liquid and echo doing that. the guilds who actually got world first on teh earlyt bosses do that
[1:15:21] swisher_szn: @gretriku atleast 1
[1:15:23] erdrick30: up
[1:15:29] LionButLeon: Pog
[1:15:32] LuciFeariUm: there always guilds that go into mythic off rip and clear the early bosses
[1:15:38] xdanielsooon: only 3 ball and 4 nados
[1:15:40] Brotholomew13: @gretriku who would want to do this tbh
[1:15:48] Nickystr1x: @LuciFeariUm i mean like they could equip like world quest gear but still kill the boss anyway cause of skill gap
[1:16:04] gretriku: @gretriku i wouldnt, its just more of a thought experiment
[1:16:06] infektyd: there was an hp nerf while you were progging it too
[1:16:10] SicariusGTV: didn't they also nerf the hp by 20% while you guys were on prog?
[1:16:16] The_Isolated_Peanut: The_Isolated_Peanut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 19 month streak! 
[1:16:17] smolderdaddyuwu: rip performance issue lol my buddy said its busted again
[1:16:30] Slapsstick: new elysian decree looks sick
[1:16:52] Brotholomew13: the rwf nerf?
[1:16:55] Basic_3: The pre-kill 25% hp and the 3rd phase seeds
[1:16:55] Cuore22: Do we know which beam it is now?
[1:17:00] Byggareebob: infinite vigor in intermission for fun aswell
[1:17:04] SavageFromSpace: that was basuically the week after the kill
[1:17:15] Sanderbrakstad: how many dogs do u ahve
[1:17:20] Celynae: o/
[1:17:25] Basic_3: The seed change you're talking about is during RWF.
[1:17:25] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/ar9b1P
[1:17:27] Brotholomew13: I don't remember another..
[1:17:30] b1azzuris: @Sanderbrakstad atleast 1
[1:17:39] thenateo2: They also added the amount of feathers
[1:18:04] gwenmh: tindral still aint got shit on anduin GIGACHAD
[1:18:05] jesuslouise: P2 seeds monkaS
[1:18:28] PacoTacoMMMGood: lol yeh thats like 4x harder lol
[1:18:38] litixio: 480 ilvl
[1:18:51] nick08_wow: lmfaoooo no shot
[1:18:55] r_Flame: cant comprehend
[1:18:57] r_Flame: it
[1:19:00] LastRowPat: no thank you.
[1:19:00] litixio: its so insane ICANT
[1:19:01] Darklott: even at 486 most guilds wouldnt manage
[1:19:05] PacoTacoMMMGood: yeh im 483 and we at 10% council lol
[1:19:17] ubba90: would people doing "world first mode" open up more people for you to consider for recruitment?
[1:19:22] gwenmh: truuuee
[1:19:25] xdanielsooon: it wouldn’t be cool at all lol
[1:19:26] larkhill: worldfirst mode as a timewalking raid would be funny
[1:19:32] fokare: Also you NEED that same comp to even attemp WF mode
[1:19:32] kadashy1: it's not even really difficult in a fun way tbh
[1:19:32] Gwedo18: maybe dont nerf the ilv of raid
[1:19:42] silent_tv1: i dont think normies realize how much extra dps you need to be able to break the roots and prespread for the seeds
[1:19:44] kadashy1: unless your enjoyment comes from winning
[1:19:45] fronkacean: but its so true though
[1:19:46] beast2: no one says that
[1:19:57] Basic_3: Max, your squares fell off your wall.
[1:19:58] Kraave: What the fuck is up Denny's!?
[1:19:58] ikMaxx: I say it
[1:19:58] brosciencegym: toadphKek
[1:20:00] PacoTacoMMMGood: alot of ppl say it
[1:20:01] Lenzoface: how many guilds do you think would have killed Tindral by now if it was completely unnerfed? Like 10?
[1:20:03] PacoTacoMMMGood: i hear it all the time
[1:20:11] larkhill: i lot of people say that top
[1:20:11] gwenmh: they can lock ilvl like in cmodes i wonder why they don't do it more
[1:20:15] frelyah: must be an NA thing
[1:20:15] fronkacean: i could do it
[1:20:16] SnoopyNA: me :)
[1:20:17] silent_tv1: my team did 5 sec p2 seeds and even that is wild
[1:20:19] Sch1ey: i know people not even in the top 1000 that said shit like that
[1:20:25] Yslingshot: they wouldnt learn shit. theyd just blame everyone else in their guild for being bad
[1:20:29] Brotholomew13: paragon throwback
[1:20:33] ubba90: if i raid 196 hours a week i could completely keep up with you guys
[1:20:33] honeychonker: I could do it if i had NASA Space UI and Private Chefs
[1:20:33] lathander557: "I'm a Liquid-tier raider" -> Dies to floor fire
[1:20:43] MortsyFGC: Dunning Kreuger
[1:20:44] LeSnapcasteur: dunning kruger effect
[1:20:45] aldarbeeto: dunning kruger
[1:20:48] magicman133: dunning cougar
[1:20:48] zamoj: dunning kruger effect
[1:20:49] ishka422: dunning kruger
[1:20:49] Cuore22: there's no such thing as more skill or better organization or better problem-solving... "bro I do almost as much DPS as them anyway"
[1:20:49] LastRowPat: I think if i dropped everything in my life and committed as hard as I could for like 3 years maybe I could???????
[1:20:49] Konijn246: will there be a race for the next season? @Maximum with the same raids
[1:20:51] glutton420: the more you fuck around, the more you find out
[1:20:52] Lenzoface: Yep, thats a true statement about most things
[1:20:53] LeSnapcasteur: its very close lol
[1:20:56] JukeboxHey: Man Paragon was on a different level back in the day. Being a finish only guild. It is a damn small country
[1:20:58] OG_Kawngi: Nerdge
[1:21:01] aldarbeeto: ah,interesting
[1:21:02] ishka422: oh shit
[1:21:04] LeSnapcasteur: The Dunning-Kruger effect occurs when a person's lack of knowledge and skill in a certain area causes them to overestimate their own competence
[1:21:05] carlDH_: carlDH_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! flip trip ripstick
[1:21:05] swisher_szn: i hit 3k and felt worse as a player
[1:21:07] LeSnapcasteur: it's exactly that
[1:21:12] smolderdaddyuwu: did you get your "lord godfeys eyeglasses" ? @Maximum
[1:21:16] Archmage_Michael: I just went back and watched the hot prowl burglary story. If the cops know these guys, why weren't they in prison?
[1:21:20] squirebdd: What is your IQ?
[1:21:27] Brotholomew13: oh shit thats right dragonflying in the old zones pog
[1:21:28] thenateo2: @swisher_szn because at 3k u realise how far off the top you are
[1:21:30] Vinciwow: !wa
[1:21:35] fronkacean: so just donning dunning-krugere'd dunning kruger?
[1:21:36] ishka422: you just dunning krugered lol
[1:21:55] lathander557: You Dun Kruger'd A-A-Ron
[1:22:05] aldarbeeto: lol
[1:22:07] cheados: it's prosecutorial discretion
[1:22:08] Gwedo18: which is why purge is not bad idea
[1:22:08] Vinciwow: @Maximum where can i get ur M+ CC wa thing
[1:22:16] Jeconti: Jeconti subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Just like how most people think they are great drivers--and they are all shit
[1:22:16] gretriku: they plead guilty to a lesser charge and getting severely lessened sentences
[1:22:20] gwenmh: which is ridiculous because of how much money the lapd has
[1:22:24] Archmage_Michael: SF, LA and NYC seem to have this problem a lot lately
[1:22:26] HypnosTheHero: @maximum I’m newer to wow and was curious if blizzard normally balances classes based on legendaries like fyrakk axe for example. Looking from the outside in it sounds like terrible balance. Thoughts?
[1:22:26] fokare: @Gwedo18 Those people would excel in the purge though
[1:22:33] certose: Who's gonna tell him
[1:22:35] Artheeri: monkaS run chat
[1:22:36] conchelobe: oh im such a bad driver
[1:22:38] Cuore22: I am also a good driver.
[1:22:39] cheados: DAs get to choose what they want to prosecute and it's what they run on
[1:22:39] conchelobe: never pay attentioin
[1:22:42] Jeconti: PROVEN POINT
[1:22:44] thasthebear: facts   everyone that isnt me is a shitty driver
[1:22:47] bonkeyyykong: i have some bad nes for you then
[1:22:48] Toointro: im aggy as fuck lol
[1:22:49] certose: MONKASTEER , I'M IN CONTROL
[1:22:52] timmayb166: unless you drive for a living you’re a bad driver
[1:22:52] Brotholomew13: Old world flying is based flying in circles tech
[1:23:00] Toointro: midwesterners are a different beast
[1:23:01] Gwedo18: oh i dont know fokare.. they would be so outnumbered
[1:23:02] TroxoStr: Great players have to come from somewhere though, even Liquid and Echo players must have played in lower ranked guilds at some point. There would surely be many more great players who haven't invested the time/effort to guild-hop up the ranks.
[1:23:03] Newlander: Living in Germany and driving the Autobahn every day greatly improved my driving ability.
[1:23:06] ishka422: i don't think im gthe best driver, but im most scared of people who think they are the best
[1:23:06] PacoTacoMMMGood: i just think it's crazy that we seriously trust every single other drive to just not hit us lol
[1:23:08] Karkesis: true
[1:23:09] zalcred: what was average ilvl for first heroic fyrakk kill @maximum
[1:23:12] SneakyFoxtrot: actually true
[1:23:15] xantaga: @Archmage_Michael its just an issue with the US incarceration system being largely for-profit rather than trying to actually rehabilitate people
[1:23:16] Brotholomew13: yeah people tend to drift in the direction they're going
[1:23:16] Javiz: i hate driving
[1:23:20] m_dep: learn to predict other drivers, also drive predictably. It's the safest way.
[1:23:22] Cuore22: oh yeah road trips are a DRAIN
[1:23:23] ubba90: its the micro choices
[1:23:24] VelouriaVR: it can be
[1:23:24] infraredpen: yes i do
[1:23:26] Brotholomew13: hell yeah I just drove for 3 days

[1:23:39] RandomTrains: RandomTrains subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months!

[1:23:49] mumsmans: its loud af
[1:23:49] spivet: my desire to do things goes down drastically the more i've driven in a day
[1:23:52] LucidAntics: 12 hours on the road for 4 days. i took a stretch break every 4 hours lol
[1:23:54] mrghostpers0n: working 9-12 hours straight

[1:24:04] SneakyFoxtrot: Longest trip i've ever taken was 12 hours. My brain was mush for like 3 days.
[1:24:07] Tegraine: I work in air traffic control, and learning how to filter plane traffic gave me a whole new perspective and more confidence in driving
[1:24:08] FiffTv: "3 hour car trip, not a long one" fucking yanks built different. 3 hour drive gets you to a different country here
[1:24:09] larkhill: long drives are fine with someone to talk to. alone, they suck ass
[1:24:17] ishka422: @se_enginheiro i listen to audiobooks/podcasts and it makes a huge difference
[1:24:23] m_dep: just becomes zero fatigue yeah its amazing i use it on my modelY all the time

[1:24:32] ThisIzD: i took a 3 tour once. Got stuck on an island.
[1:24:38] PacoTacoMMMGood: not burning the calories making micro decisions driving
[1:24:43] ishka422: @FiffTv lol i can drive 3 hours and still be in the same state
[1:24:44] bronzleaguehiro: it´s so exhausting people fell asleep while driving
[1:24:48] smolderdaddyuwu: @FiffTv get americad. lol
[1:24:50] 2btac: Driving 15 hours just stopping for gas moving state to state and I never want to drive more than 1.5hrs now.
[1:24:56] mrm00m00man: driving = thundering, cognitive load confirmed?
[1:25:06] mybootyisasnack: its called just have your friend that loves driving drive for you ez
[1:25:09] sednajoan: I only feel it when I finally stop. I love the act of driving...
[1:25:14] Jnxz: that's why they have recalls for it lol

[1:47:32] magicman133: Dr. Antos, a bit over qualified for simple teaching job
[1:47:33] The_Mail_Man__: @LazzirusWoW press go live and tell ur friends
[1:47:35] nationas: hey max that drama YT was hilarious

[1:48:20] m_dep: dont blame you tho, easy money
[1:48:20] fleezuzchrist: you are a drama farmer now
[1:48:21] gonzobone: yeah it was way less enjoyable than the wholesome surprise raid content
[1:48:21] leubinator: DRAMA?
[1:48:28] Zimmerh: Sadge to become a drama andy
[1:48:29] NotD4k: EZ Clap
[1:48:32] Archmage_Michael: That was awesome
[1:48:34] iCarDog: milked trauma
[1:48:35] BlazinHurricane: But drama sustains us
[1:48:36] SneakyWoodPecker: He was in a netflix documentary about it I think
[1:48:37] misran: the community has also absolutely beaten the "non verbal" joke to death now
[1:48:38] thecajuncommie: monetizing others pain, get rich
[1:48:40] m_dep: DRAMA??? SNIFFA
[1:48:41] nationas: you need to have the context that its just a silly argument blown way outta it
[1:48:42] kj01a: Its afflicted bolstering week, so we dont have a lot to do anyway LUL

[1:49:00] darthhelmett: @jarbeegbk Don't get hit by nados, drop fire properly, and don't all hit the balls at once.
[1:49:01] Rakim88: YEP both were shit ppl
[1:49:01] leubinator: easiest money of your life tho
[1:49:02] chefdejour82: its funny
[1:49:05] Archmage_Michael: I had a crush on JD's lawyer

[1:49:15] chris_0verkill: are you doing keys today max?
[1:49:17] Mikayyy: i never understood why that trial was so big anyways
[1:49:20] Madgeneto: nah it's trashy af
[1:49:22] u_nit_y: as it seems, other life are more interesting to think about the own
[1:49:24] bronzleaguehiro: it´s weird that they made it even public so crazy
[1:49:25] u_nit_y: s
[1:49:25] Asynoel: She's gonna be the Monika Lewenski of our time. People refuse to see how fucked up that whole thing was
[1:49:27] Brohdin: I hate the "they're public figures" argument too to justify it
[1:49:29] Rakim88: tabloids gotta eat Kappa
[1:49:30] thecajuncommie: laughing at others pain and suffering is the American way
[1:49:31] Yagr6: people judge themselves vs others
[1:49:32] Madgeneto: exactly
[1:49:32] baxter5569: sodapoppin is a living meme, asmon is a drama andy. without the drama he has nothing
[1:49:33] smolderdaddyuwu: @Maximum what is 5+5+5+5*0?
[1:49:36] Celynae: I liked the video, its sometimes good to hear "if you're bein a bitch, just say sorry, i was bein a bitch"
[1:49:44] Lindorn_: reality tv fiends
[1:49:48] Dzor12: Isn't that all TV shows and Movies though? Watching other people's lives?

[1:50:08] kj01a: Guess I'll take down my shire to you :(
[1:50:09] nick08_wow: next would be people beliving in astrology signs KEKW
[1:50:11] smolderdaddyuwu: @Maximum what is 5+5+5+5x0
[1:50:12] litixio: people prob do that for you lol @Maximum
[1:50:12] nationas: thd is my idol
[1:50:17] Yagr6: i have zero social media
[1:50:19] leubinator: if your life is shit might aswell watch someone elses life going to shit
[1:50:22] chefdejour82: kind of feel bad always being followed around
[1:50:31] R0NGG: EGOs
[1:50:34] MemphisGamingTTV: They also have blinders on when they idolize someone. That person can do no wrong
[1:50:36] Lara_TV_: Pretty dysfunctional takes from growl ngl
[1:50:41] gonzobone: especially with the drama you covered it just seemed like a few dudes in a high pressure situation (overall) havin a bad day and then it's this huge icky content farm
[1:50:42] alkarldeath: M+ players are unhinged and mentally ill, thats why they push M+
[1:50:45] Starforkx: the little albeit to the whole parasocial thing is that even though they're normal people, some normal ass people still do some cool shit
[1:50:52] Celynae: Yeah like, blame doesn't come into it, sometimes you get a little too madge
[1:50:55] Ashille: @Asphoron it's garbage because people want it to be, not because it actually is for the people who eat drama shit
[1:50:55] m_dep: Yeah but chronic wow players definitely dont have the best social skills
[1:50:56] Lindorn_: its hard for some people to do that
[1:51:03] ottermatic69: ive done that lol
[1:51:07] WowGrandma78: they did keys last night
[1:51:07] Rakim88: ppl have bad days it happens... need to reflect learn n move on
[1:51:08] nationas: you cant just go full mute you gotta brick the key, no half measures
[1:51:09] bebincalicious: Driney FeelsBadMan
[1:51:10] R0NGG: streamer m+ egos bruv
[1:51:18] MemphisGamingTTV: It definitely happens
[1:51:22] WowGrandma78: Rogue wasnt there though
[1:51:22] magicman133: m+ players are known bitches
[1:51:22] LuciFeariUm: M+ streamers have an ego
[1:51:22] darthhelmett: m+ is a weird beast at that level man
[1:51:27] LuciFeariUm: they can find a new team
[1:51:31] LuciFeariUm: guild is different
[1:51:35] LemmingsOCE: Wowgrandma calling JPC "rogue" is so based
[1:51:35] Ironshax: how do i find Max's shot calling Weak aura
[1:51:36] gonzobone: do you think it's the smaller group size that amplifies interpersonal issues that leads people to have a harder time just moving past these things?
[1:51:44] mrghostpers0n: doyou have anything planned for tonight?
[1:51:44] Lilurrn: going full mute is just a way of being anti social and running from your problems it solves nothing
[1:51:47] Turkeypitz: dude, most people are too into themselves to realise how important it is to acknowledge personal shit
[1:51:48] elysona: Usually in like my mid 20 keys if someone messes up theres a 50% chance they leave as soon as they rez
[1:51:50] kj01a: It happens in most competitive raid teams too, but you just happen to be in a guild with one of the best growth mindsets of any wow community. It's also a big reason of why you're on top.
[1:51:52] destrominater: that happens IRL too. sometimes there’s other issues people can’t get past. when I heard the beef, my immediate thought was “this is really about something else.”
[1:51:56] Archmage_Michael: if the good players stop playing keys with you, you're done. So most probably rather behave
[1:51:59] m_dep: oh 100%, the smaller the number of people the more toxic things can be
[1:52:00] u_nit_y: oh, g0d
[1:52:01] u_nit_y: i found it
[1:52:06] WowGrandma78: i didnt call him anything i just said he wasnt there .  I dont call anyone out im not in that class
[1:52:07] MitsuhideTenkai: It's a question of habit and the environnent you're in, if you're not used to do it, its super hard to be the one doing it
[1:52:15] ZooNamiii: M+ people are independent contractors .....they move on to other groups
[1:52:17] eveecat: @Lilurrn yeah stonewalling is incredibly toxic
[1:52:32] nick08_wow: @Ironshax you Prayge that he actually finishes working on it and releases it
[1:52:46] gonzobone: i was just thinking like dota teams constantly have drama because each person is accountable for so much more in a smaller team than a raid
[1:52:53] smolderdaddyuwu: @eveecat amen. nerf doesn't respect his teammates
[1:53:00] Yagr6: toxic stuff
[1:53:01] destrominater: Hi @wowgrandma78 happy Wednesday.
[1:53:13] WowGrandma78: They are all great players.   Those kijnd of keys are stressful
[1:53:18] VelouriaVR: i think the reason there isn't a lot of teams because any sort of "competitive" M+ culture is also fairly new
[1:53:22] Archmage_Michael: and JPC was right. If you're 30 you should be mature enough to admit when you're at fault
[1:53:24] ubba90: did nerf finally own up to his bitch mode?
[1:53:28] JukeboxHey: @Maximum Today seems like a great day for some mythic pugging. Perhaps 6/9 or help someone kill smoldieboy
[1:53:31] LuciFeariUm: @Lilurrn i literally go full mute in comms in my team all the time. But we all have the understanding that if I mute its because *I* need to focus and im struggling at the time. Its all about context and understanding
[1:53:37] smolderdaddyuwu: @ubba90 of course not.
[1:53:39] R0NGG: m+ teams dont have like real leadership tho or structure
[1:53:44] u_nit_y: hes practically talking about life. im listening
[1:53:51] niveattv: respect the autoraty
[1:53:57] Sirigath: A yung buck
[1:54:11] larkhill: a lot of other guilds dont have the luxury of kicking their toxic players from he raid like liquid does
[1:54:14] Madgeneto: a yung dip
[1:54:18] Yagr6: i wish when i made a mistake i would just get bricked up, then i would always be bricked up
[1:54:21] eveecat: @LuciFeariUm muting is fine, it's stonewalling that is not
[1:54:21] kesthus: @Maximum why ashes neveer drop?
[1:54:23] rukt: i feel like owning up to your mistakes makes people gain more respect for you
[1:54:33] chefdejour82: nobody perfect
[1:54:38] bronzleaguehiro: is it a big deal to mess up ? or is it more of a deal not to say: hey i messed up ? @Maximum
[1:54:39] ItchY_val: People often put their ego ahead of objectivity
[1:54:40] eveecat: @rukt 100%
[1:54:45] fronkacean: also just depends on the culture i reckon
[1:55:00] CSmith170: honestly think nerf is just kind of toxic.
[1:55:02] OG_Kawngi: yep
[1:55:02] LuciFeariUm: @bronzleaguehiro messing up is okay if you own up to it. Owning up to it is the EXTREMELY important part
[1:55:03] planooooooooooooooooooooo: you think a 6th man shotcalling m+ would work?
[1:55:07] Lara_TV_: That is true 100%
[1:55:09] KaisenSiru: YEP
[1:55:12] Uhnk_PR: 100!
[1:55:18] ZooNamiii: YEP
[1:55:26] eveecat: was this whole nerf drama streamed anywhere?
[1:55:27] papesoul: Only if you learn, though
[1:55:33] Rakim88: thats a personality thing tho... some ppl have an issue admitting them being wrong. they get entrench on their beliefs instead of admitting they r wrong. look at aaron rodgers still on the covid shit n all his crazy shit.
[1:55:38] LazarP: @Maximum WHAT IF IM JUST PERFECT?
[1:55:40] smolderdaddyuwu: @planooooooooooooooooooooo it does. meeres from echo did/does it
[1:55:41] Zivrum: Make mistakes constantly and admit to all generates hate lol
[1:55:52] tinyrivers: i mean that's just a character flaw lol
[1:55:52] m_dep: not a personality thing, thats a behavior thing
[1:55:53] CoffeeASAP: lol
[1:55:56] OldCoinzz: Off topic question, over the course of a tier of mythic raiding how many wipes do you think tanking should be the cause of? Tanks make up 10% of the raid so should they be responsible for 10% of wipes? Or does their job being different than the other 90% of the raid lend them into having more/less than 10% of wipes?
[1:55:57] Aessari: @Rakim88 thats a character fail point, not personality issue
[1:56:00] menzlo: aaron rodgers so annoying
[1:56:00] papesoul: If you make a lot of mistake, accept them, and get better over time, people will respect you.
[1:56:01] Xandid: Sounds like some of them need to learn to communicate like adults
[1:56:02] rukt: yeah i meant more where if you dont make mistakes often but when you do you admit it then its good
[1:56:02] Yagr6: yea like biden voters cant admit they were wrong
[1:56:04] Sirigath: Stay silent to lose aggro EZ
[1:56:05] gonzobone: if you went back into the playing side of competitive wow vs the leadership/management side would you enjoy high end raiding or top tier M+ more?
[1:56:07] CSmith170: @rakim88 that’s called being a narcissist 😂
[1:56:07] bronzleaguehiro: yeah i would be kinda intimidated to mess up to be honest i guess i make mistakes i am just a 4/9 M Player chill guild
[1:56:08] Datguyjay: KEKW
[1:56:12] certified86: TRUE
[1:56:12] ottermatic69: hes a doofus
[1:56:18] menzlo: thinks he's the smartest in the room
[1:56:18] Madgeneto: this is absolutely true. i joined a guild mid s1 and did an alt m+ with the gm and rl, i did a minor mistake in a low key that we had in the bag anyway, he started "what the fuck are you doing". never admitted to anything. left the boat early when others started being toxic too, then they disbanded on rashok YEP

[2:25:17] TotallyNotRaien: @lars_keizer none of them worked for me
[2:25:21] Jjmn12: maybe dragonriding without glyphs while leveling soured people on it
[2:25:22] Awsum18: stop the cap
[2:25:24] FatPanda97: The only way you miss the platform is of you don't have all your points

[2:30:58] nick08_wow: at a 25
[2:31:00] sheckles: that would be lit actually

[2:37:11] Madgeneto: win win 4Head
[2:37:13] bronzleaguehiro: a random rotation maybe from all the season dungeons so far per week?
[2:37:15] menzlo: 10 dungeon season woo
[2:37:16] gunshinsora: maybe they keep the mega dung as a mega dung instead of M+
[2:37:16] Lars_Keizer: @jack_the_dipper most events are based on the date if they're not tied to a reset
[2:37:16] Slapsstick: Tol dagor PepeLaugh
[2:37:16] leubinator: all df dungeons about to have a midoff
[2:37:17] AerinClouds: come on DF dungeons I missed the first two seasons and actually want to do them in m+
[2:37:25] nick08_wow: 10 feels too many tho Sadge
[2:37:26] Suited_Monkey: please god no
[2:37:26] LuciFeariUm: i could see them not doing mega simply because it was in this season
[2:37:27] Lyonidus: man i never want to do uldaman or halls of infusion ever again
[2:37:29] ciggyman: bring back mage bracers from mechagon tbh
[2:37:33] Jack_the_Dipper: @Lars_Keizer aaaah okay ty for the info
[2:37:35] Ashille: they'll bring back MD for the first season of next expac?
[2:37:36] struggs91: ksh at all 16s timed lol

[2:37:38] 1kemba: Ruby life pools and azure vault again monkaW
[2:37:39] Darklott: tbh not having the mega dungeon wouldnt be bad either since we just had it anyways and we didnt have the others
[2:37:42] menzlo: wonder if we get seasonal
[2:37:43] Kawatteruwow: chains in neltharus lets gooo

[2:37:58] Madgeneto: df dungeons are banger i miss them so much
[2:37:59] StupidAussieDrongo: I dont wanna do Nokhud again but the others are pog
[2:38:00] kelly_mac06: I really like Brackenhide
[2:38:02] Suited_Monkey: The 8 original DF dungeons flow so bad idk. I also HEAVILY dislike vehicle combat so nokhud pisses me off. personal problem tho
[2:38:05] kelly_mac06: way more than i thought i would
[2:38:06] leubinator: atleast 4 of the 8 df keys are bad sounds like a not good season to me
[2:38:09] simonromlie: RLP on Tyrannical xdd
[2:38:13] AerinClouds: @infuse123 if it means no more everbloom then I don’t mind haha

[2:38:40] Madgeneto: did he say neltharus good?
[2:38:43] nick08_wow: my brain needs a tiermarker format to understand what just came out of your mouth
[2:38:45] StupidAussieDrongo: what if all mega dungeon season
[2:38:46] mattack2k12: i miss shadowland dungeons
[2:38:48] infuse123: If they do Df dungeons do you think they retune them or just leave as they were @Maximum
[2:38:51] leubinator: brackenhide as a melee sucks too get your ass bitten
[2:38:55] Lyonidus: i forgot neltharus even existed, shows my attitude towards the dungeon
[2:38:56] mattack2k12: except plaguefall
[2:38:59] oneneoeun: @mattack2k12 giga based
[2:39:01] feeras_gg: @StupidAussieDrongo id rlly like that
[2:39:05] AerinClouds: what’s wrong with halls and uldaman?
[2:39:11] Lars_Keizer: I want De other Side just for the ardenwaeld aoe area
[2:39:12] Thoreya: @Darklott ruby and nokhud are also wack
[2:39:12] Desorient123: s1 algethar as unholy was a vibe
[2:39:15] stelfbronco: @maximum do you have any idea why blizzard did not do a 4th raid because personally I would have really liked to see it
[2:39:22] ciggyman: 30seconds of holding cock waiting for door to open in brh
[2:39:23] Madgeneto: @mattack2k12 we'll get them next xpac

[2:39:56] ectocantaim: imagine if u cant use lege in s4 xdd
[2:39:58] BiBaButzeBenne: does it even matter? they can just add 30seconds on the timer. same as removing a 30se RP
[2:40:01] leubinator: it is stupid in m+
[2:40:01] mattack2k12: @Madgeneto nice, as bs as sl was, the dungeons were really great
[2:40:05] Elioss: I think the problem with Rise is all the running and the portal shit
[2:40:05] oneneoeun: @Aquadriel ??? listen to players that aren't invested
[2:40:07] Madgeneto: it's annoying
[2:40:08] Darklott: if you have hands its just a fun 20sec or something
[2:40:09] Maldre: its not fun
[2:40:09] Camelbak21: Waiting 1 min for chromie to break the ice
[2:40:10] gdtomii: thats super fun
[2:40:11] m_dep: having the portal to skip the dodging is what makes it okay
[2:40:12] alarkin: Dragonflight dungeons are fine but doing old dungeons has made me realize I really really miss dungeons being simpler and less of a cognitive load - so I am not excited for that part of season 4 DF dungeons at all.
[2:40:13] Celynae: if they just add the RP time on the end of the timer, it shouldn't matter
[2:40:13] m_dep: without it would be bad
[2:40:13] Camelbak21: fun gameplay
[2:40:17] CoffeeASAP: DOTI actually had a lot of RP removed from it believe it or not lol
[2:40:17] Madgeneto: @Madgeneto agree
[2:40:18] LuciFeariUm: @BiBaButzeBenne it entirely is not the same, it changes cd timers entirely

[2:40:32] 1kemba: i rembember people were saying that section in mechagon where you have to dodge mini robots was going to be a problem PepeLaugh
[2:40:32] pnguinwow: hell yeah love this song
[2:40:33] Benefitzs_: im pretty sure they nerfed the gauntlet to be less aggressive, it was harder before it was in M+
[2:40:34] stelfbronco: @maximum why did blizzard not do. a 4th raid
[2:40:35] Lyonidus: ppl gonna disagree but i hated the rp in freehold
[2:40:37] Dowson91: Tyr just standing there for 15 seconds is also insane
[2:40:42] gwenmh: everything should be unlocked
[2:40:44] ThisIzD: this song wtf
[2:40:45] gwenmh: zero rp
[2:40:46] Zircons: Tyr: Chatting
[2:40:47] leubinator: freehold rp was so bad
[2:40:59] Lars_Keizer: Halls of Valor original Aware

[2:41:56] chasen218: @Maximum  what are the chances to get in voice with u ?
[2:41:57] Codester_remix: Now what's the realist pov?
[2:42:10] gretriku: i lean towards the latter, but the former is unfortunately a real possibility
[2:42:11] Rokkar91: i like fated tbh
[2:42:13] Cycore: Nah it's actually for "lore" reasons, Galakrond is gone so no bad guy to fight left in this expansion KEKW
[2:42:13] Qubuuuu: how big of an impact do you think microsoft will have on blizzard in the long term?
[2:42:15] ModestMewtwo21: why make many content when little content do trick?
[2:42:17] Lars_Keizer: @chasen218 HUH
[2:42:22] Madgeneto: KEKW ???
[2:42:23] Ruinx81: Fated is yawn
[2:42:26] Madgeneto: covid was bfa
[2:42:26] Squats3: @Maximum i really need to understand why blizzard is just okay with people not wanting to play the game because affixes are shit
[2:42:30] Orang3joose: @chasen218 95%
[2:42:32] Squats3: i NEED to understand
[2:42:36] 1kemba: the best thing about fated was the dinar tbh
[2:42:41] AerinClouds: fly around more MoP this tower sucks
[2:42:49] Ruinx81: Annoying they’ve gone to this 4 zone 8 dungeon expansion arrangement
[2:42:59] Ancine: wow is too formulaic, 8 dungeons, 4 zones, 1 raid, and every patch is just 1 zone and 1 raid. They need to do something ambitious
[2:43:00] Aro725: theres no way they didnt make 2 raids into one end of SL and then used fated to have something to do while they worked on DF
[2:43:03] dopemindz: I feel fated allows more of the team to work on the next expac and get it out more polished
[2:43:13] Gatherdude: yo u wanna blast a 16 brh?
[2:43:24] Ruinx81: SoD will be popping off
[2:43:28] Kawatteruwow: @Ancine this
[2:43:28] ectocantaim: xdd
[2:43:31] deathbyxoxo: What are the chances you think they'll bake in things like addons + WA to the base interface to make new players feel less intimidated to trying the game?
[2:43:36] Squats3: they had been working on DF way before the last patch came out
[2:43:37] Benefitzs_: crazy part is they really did a "community vote" for what tier set we use and some classes got the worst option for all 3 specs
[2:43:41] Benefitzs_: just give us all 3
[2:43:44] KaladinHS: where can I get max's m+ weakauras?
[2:43:51] Aquadriel: what if they lied to you? collectively.
[2:43:57] lurk_e: just woke up and saw the shaman aoe bug NOSHOT
[2:43:59] Ruinx81: NDAs
[2:44:15] Aro725: Damn, I feel like Anduin was an endboss for sure. And they just like put it together with jailer
[2:44:16] Cycore: there's no way though the last 4 bosses of the raid have a distinctly different theme LUL
[2:44:21] chasen218: @Maximum  as u have good connection with blizzard , can u please tell them to buff hunters ? no 1 is accepting me in m+
[2:44:22] itsthelichqueen: Didn't they want to put the Arbiter the last boss but ended up not doing it because of the hate?
[2:44:26] ciggyman: Kkorpa
[2:44:29] smolderdaddyuwu: signed NDAs to not talk about NDAs lol
[2:44:40] Jack_the_Dipper: Holfy hell Outland cup is difficult
[2:44:54] Ruinx81: Jailers plan all along was to have 3 raids only
[2:44:55] Madgeneto: @Benefitzs_ define worst option
[2:45:04] lvdw1g: do y'all believe in the lizard people and bigfoot aswell
[2:45:08] Ethan6233: survival
[2:45:09] Darklott: it would ahve been sick but such a balancing nightmare
[2:45:09] Benefitzs_: Warrior comes to mind first
[2:45:11] timmayb166: blood
[2:45:11] felwink: if bro says rogue imma be trippin
[2:45:12] Basic_3: A class that chatter made up in their brain.
[2:45:12] Maldre: warrior
[2:45:14] Moonkinstv: DH Tank S1 ...
[2:45:16] Artenuous: warrior
[2:45:16] AramusRet: warrior
[2:45:16] Kawatteruwow: bm
[2:45:17] xrader858: so subjective
[2:45:17] Carax500: warrior
[2:45:19] H2WShiro: Holy pal season 2, kekw
[2:45:19] drewsky96: I don't agree with warrior even a little bit
[2:45:24] TalestoChill: Augvoker got jipped since they only got two choices to go with lmfao
[2:45:24] Carax500: shoudl have had s2 for s2
[2:45:24] felwink: warrior season 2 is great wym>
[2:45:27] LuciFeariUm: rdruid s3 :(
[2:45:28] aelimas: @timmayb166 thats not even true
[2:45:29] reggiepowa: no it didnt, fury got the best set
[2:45:30] Diinklebeeerg: fury warrior t2 is the good one
[2:45:31] Carax500: for s2 for fury
[2:45:32] Madgeneto: didnt yall hate s3 fury set?
[2:45:42] codydoubleu: i just wish they would let us get any appearance, real bummer to miss out on some sets
[2:45:48] gretriku: critcake the GOAT
[2:45:48] dopemindz: why are people hating fated?
[2:45:49] Mfkr90: worst is relative to the individua
[2:45:50] ErikJugend: S1
[2:45:52] reggiepowa: season 1
[2:45:52] drewsky96: season 1
[2:45:53] lurk_e: i was wondering why they picked that LUL
[2:45:54] SkunkTruck: I prefer S3 fury
[2:45:54] shizuma_lol: s1
[2:45:56] ectocantaim: critcake still no legendaray Aware
[2:46:00] Branyawn: Here is a cook; Azerite Armor Ring selections, but 2/4pc bonus for each slot (max 4).
[2:46:02] leubinator: imagine voting for a non anger management tierset for fury yall are tripping
[2:46:10] felwink: "democracy doesnt work when my choice doesnt win" xdd
[2:46:15] NotD4k: @felwink classic
[2:46:18] Qubuuuu: xdding
[2:46:20] Smidz_: @SkunkTruck Yeah, 2 buttons is fun! /s
[2:46:22] oneneoeun: @felwink true
[2:46:22] StupidAussieDrongo: s2 won
[2:46:22] Madgeneto: @Branyawn WhoLetHimJoel
[2:46:24] reggiepowa: season 2 won and it is the best playstyle
[2:46:33] ErikJugend: S2
[2:46:34] lulukitty: s2
[2:46:36] atamdev: s2
[2:46:38] pnguinwow: s2
[2:46:38] TFT_Fiora: xdd
[2:46:42] Squats3: s2
[2:46:42] Maldre: s2 isnt a playstyle
[2:46:43] deku_oce: s2 in NA and s3 in EU
[2:46:44] drewsky96: the 4 pc was kinda doodoo for season 2 fury, but if it's balanced higher then it's definitely possible
[2:46:46] ciggyman: chatters in shambles
[2:46:47] Maldre: you can run AM
[2:46:47] Aro725: LOL
[2:46:47] NotD4k: aotc chatters
[2:46:49] gretriku: oh look, critcake right again lol
[2:46:49] reggiepowa: no prot got the best bonus as well
[2:46:53] Aro725: Chatting
[2:46:53] vilfork: yall are just trying to bait this man, tf
[2:46:53] Madgeneto: one guy
[2:46:54] JayPain: think u are getting 1 guyed
[2:46:56] pnguinwow: nah that guy is wafflin hard
[2:46:58] Tooyoo: Fury warriors are split with s2 and s3
[2:46:58] Benefitzs_: Season 3 was the most flexible, i get critcake is very good but his opinions are not universal. EU and NA had very different votes
[2:46:58] oneneoeun: Chatting
[2:46:59] felwink: typical critcake W
[2:47:03] MurtagDev: bad warriors in chat complaining about good tier sets
[2:47:06] Maldre: S2 is bad in single target for fury
[2:47:07] Tooyoo: so there are many unhappy fury warriors in warrior discord
[2:47:08] Aizen_NP: lmao one guyed
[2:47:09] realGameTheory: gachiBASS
[2:47:09] struggs91: dont group us in with that yahoo
[2:47:10] smolderdaddyuwu: thats a gangbang
[2:47:11] simonromlie: S2 and S3 fury was just VERY polarized, 50% wanted S2 and 50% wanted S3 and each of the half hate the other spec
[2:47:17] StupidAussieDrongo: s3 Fury is just 2 buttons
[2:47:18] Aro725: critcakeLETSGOO critcakeLETSGOO critcakeLETSGOO
[2:47:18] Chiick_: It just sucks because s3 and s2 were so close just would rather be able to choose
[2:47:19] TheBroCrow: so what you're saying is you can take 10 guys
[2:47:25] codydoubleu: Warr sets are good, chat wanting to play 1 button macro fury
[2:47:28] StupidAussieDrongo: one if you macro
[2:47:28] gretriku: warriors are down bad because nobody wants them in M+
[2:47:29] MrScottyMac: is this a PVE vs PVP issue?
[2:47:33] pnguinwow: i just started a warrior and the s3 playstyle requires 1 brain cell
[2:47:33] Basic_3: Destro S1 is definitely a protest vote.
[2:47:43] Gordiie: I'm pretty sure most specs had very similar votes between NA and EU
[2:47:48] whatisthistwitchlol: worst case are bm hunters, their iq betrayed them
[2:47:51] Swiftar: The Afflicted acting as players this week is hilarious
[2:47:56] Elioss: How do you tune the Resto shaman
[2:47:58] Zircons: just like the 10.2.5 class tuning OMEGALUL
[2:48:01] Elioss: Its just plain 10% crit
[2:48:01] waffleberryx: theres been so much class tuning tiersets gna play diffrently than when they came out for some classes
[2:48:04] caldricus: what stops them from making a crucible - Trial of Valor type raid shouldnt take too many resources right?
[2:48:05] gretriku: i hope so, but i'll believe it when it actually happens
[2:48:05] drewsky96: I think the main issue with S2 fury was that rampage is too weak in single target. Like, way too weak
[2:48:08] whatisthistwitchlol: s2 set would be op after rework, yet they voted for the useless s3
[2:48:09] Madgeneto: the problem is if they do tune the sets but not the whole class OMEGALUL
[2:48:09] Tooyoo: @Maximum Fury warrior discord theorycrafter wanted S3, Critcake wanted S2. Minor drama ensued
[2:48:09] aelimas: i mean it would feel bad to have to take the first season set over 2 and 3
[2:48:14] SkunkTruck: i think all warriors would agree they would prefer a talent rework over any tier set
[2:48:16] Rakim88: always stay 2 steps ahead of blizz 5Head
[2:48:17] Aro725: @Benefitzs_ not for fury imo. I dont think its flexible at all
[2:48:20] Benefitzs_: Its hard to quantify this in short form, my TLDR is S1 arms set is the worst option because it locks you into chosing aoe build or ST build and season 3 lets you do both with a single build.
[2:48:20] isfer: @Maximum what do you think about s1 monk tier set winning for s4?
[2:48:22] LuciFeariUm: The best part is that the dude said "MOST of the CLASSES got the worst sets on all specs"
[2:48:22] Qubuuuu: which windwalker tier won?
[2:48:30] stelfbronco: @maximum did not raid during fated how does it work?
[2:48:30] lvdw1g: can't believe pvp windwalkers scuffed our vote
[2:48:34] aelimas: @Qubuuuu 1
[2:48:35] Rampo123: TRUE LMFAO
[2:48:35] ErikJugend: He did a pinned post in warrior disc to influence the vote
[2:48:37] lvdw1g: @Qubuuuu s1... SMH
[2:48:40] gretriku: BASED
[2:48:40] Rampo123: fkin class discord rats
[2:48:43] StupidAussieDrongo: @Maximum what are your thoughts on s1 of ww winning
[2:48:50] smolderdaddyuwu: lmao archi was pissed
[2:49:02] Insertname4321: The DK wowhead stuff is made by someone who doesn't even play the game garf
[2:49:05] Zircons: class discords told me not to take sigil of chains
[2:49:09] vilfork: except the dk guys, they are goated
[2:49:10] leubinator: why would anyone ever go into skyhold
[2:49:10] lightfoot94: frost dk got the best one so im happy PermaSmug
[2:49:13] leubinator: thats a dark place
[2:49:16] Rakim88: the voting really blew class discord up.. it was crazy
[2:49:19] jughuj: @Zircons kek
[2:49:19] EFFSIN: Can i get the non verbal weakaura @Maximum
[2:49:22] Maldre: there is nothing with the warrior sets related to gameplay just passive damage
[2:49:25] Zircons: Skyhold is disneyland compared to fel hammer
[2:49:28] Rampo123: WH OMEGALUL
[2:49:28] aelimas: @Insertname4321 what spec are you talking about
[2:49:30] atamdev: what he does wtf
[2:49:33] ErikJugend: Bicepspump? He's in Pescorus
[2:49:35] vilfork: biceps KEKW
[2:49:39] ectocantaim: isnt it biceps?
[2:49:41] StupidAussieDrongo: Bicepspump plays...
[2:49:42] Insertname4321: Taeznak
[2:49:44] Qubuuuu: I recently picked up ww monk and enjoy it in m+, despise playing with serenity in raid tho. Does s1 still use serenity?
[2:49:45] leubinator: biceps raids with azor
[2:49:45] Aro725: Pretty sure its Biceps and he def plays the game lol
[2:49:45] Outk_Ripper: biceps and khazak do them im p sure
[2:49:45] Benjg7: panthea and mandl both play the game too
[2:49:46] Insertname4321: makes them now
[2:49:46] StupidAussieDrongo: and plays better than you
[2:49:49] muonz: biceps got demoted both from wowhead and DK discord because of minor disagreements
[2:49:52] JustRewind: Biceps is a legend
[2:49:52] Gorehowl: look at it this way, your average NA warrior andy caps at like an 18 key so s3 is premier for them, meanwhile EU boys finish at 25s making s2 stronger
[2:50:00] AstralDoge: Yo max how's it been?
[2:50:02] Benjg7: blood dk guys def play the game
[2:50:12] ectocantaim: huh
[2:50:14] waffleberryx: wow palyers being petty? never!
[2:50:15] Slaytime101: Blood is done by Mandl
[2:50:17] Onyo1337: DK discord is probably one of the worst class discords to get info tbf
[2:50:17] Cycore: guide writer mafia strikes again Sadge
[2:50:21] Lars_Keizer: SNIFFA drama?
[2:50:28] Madgeneto: SNIFFA drama?
[2:50:32] Gordiie: Taeznak is goated
[2:50:32] Rampo123: KEKW
[2:50:38] Wheva: Taeznak is the goat
[2:50:39] gretriku: ive never heard of the frost dk guy
[2:50:59] Outk_Ripper: Khazak is a beast too
[2:50:59] Gordiie: Khazak is also very smart
[2:51:00] Wheva: Khazak is fantastic
[2:51:03] gretriku: ah ok
[2:51:06] MrScottyMac: Khazak does play a lot
[2:51:06] LeSnapcasteur: khazak is the other more active mod
[2:51:09] Wheva: he plays frost at a very high level
[2:51:10] mobbo: I remember Kibo was writing Havoc guides mostly while maining warlock or not playing
[2:51:14] EFFSIN: Can i get that mythic non verbal wa @Maximum
[2:51:15] Madgeneto: KEKW
[2:51:17] Benefitzs_: @Maximum  Its hard to quantify this in short form, my TLDR is S1 arms set is the worst option because it locks you into choosing between an AOE build or ST build and season 3 lets you do both with a single build. The Arms tuning was the problem with S3 not the gameplay
[2:51:18] NotD4k: so u have more drama content
[2:51:18] MrScottyMac: chatters out in full force tonight
[2:51:19] Steehll: PopNemo

[2:51:21] Codester_remix: They want drama
[2:51:21] J0RAR: yappers be yapping
[2:51:21] Slaytime101: SNIFFA Drama?
[2:51:22] Lars_Keizer: SNIFFA
[2:51:22] atamdev: its what chatters do
[2:51:23] SkrrtRussel: its twitch chat KEKW
[2:51:23] mr_jimbone: drama is good drama is life
[2:51:24] LuciFeariUm: @EFFSIN its in the discord
[2:51:25] alb1nn0: cuz chat is smooth brained
[2:51:25] chefdejour82: starting shit
[2:51:25] panser_nes: they angy and wanna blame someone
[2:51:26] chasen218: @Maximum  are u married?
[2:51:30] LeSnapcasteur: DRAMA?
[2:51:30] pnguinwow: max makes 1 drama video and the chat just trys to stir up drama now
[2:51:30] Qubuuuu: SKIP
[2:51:31] TFT_Fiora: SNIFFA
[2:51:33] dopemindz: @Insertname4321 KEKW
[2:51:34] MemphisGamingTTV: I'm assuming you have to know the class pretty good to be a writer for that class.
[2:51:35] LeSnapcasteur: DRAMA???
[2:51:35] Outk_Ripper: Khazak answered a bunch of questions about analyzer and stuff, super helpful guy
[2:51:35] Madgeneto: every day im wafflin
[2:51:35] Aquadriel: and i thought asmongold chat was bad...
[2:51:36] Camelbak21: Bro there has to be drama, next season is 4 months away
[2:51:37] smolderdaddyuwu: they want drama
[2:51:38] lvdw1g: can we please yap about ww votes
[2:51:38] OG_Kawngi: SNIFFA new drama streamer
[2:51:40] Onyo1337: people are thirsty for drama after the nonverbal stuff
[2:51:41] Aro725: @Benefitzs_ You should paste it again, he might see it the 5th time
[2:51:44] kj01a: thats what afflicted bolstering week does to a mfer
[2:51:48] ambiotic: I watched it, it was tame
[2:51:48] LeSnapcasteur: DRAMA
[2:51:49] stelfbronco: @maximum why does this tier fell so much worse than last teir
[2:51:50] FatPanda97: I just watched it
[2:51:50] Rakim88: read the youtube comments Kappa
[2:51:51] EFFSIN: !discord
[2:51:51] StreamElements: https://discord.gg/EPHq4vUDuu or try !liquidcord
[2:51:52] evade19: what is your reasoning for disliking "class discords" so much?
[2:51:54] m_dep: dude your best video ever
[2:51:55] TFT_Fiora: this video is bis wdym
[2:51:56] NotD4k: DRAMA?
[2:51:56] Aizen_NP: fronk getting fired
[2:51:56] m_dep: not even close
[2:51:56] reymargera: PepeLaugh
[2:51:57] Slaytime101: Just watched that today
[2:51:57] leubinator: sometimes u gotta yap
[2:51:58] JakeParkbench: I think it was a pretty level cut of the coverage
[2:52:00] Benefitzs_: @Aro725 that was the 2nd time but ok buddy
[2:52:04] Codester_remix: Drama = Clicks
[2:52:04] FatPanda97: I just missed the stream
[2:52:08] dopemindz: Max the new drama channel
[2:52:08] ishka422: its gonna be the best video you ever post lol
[2:52:08] LeSnapcasteur: I like growl but let's be honest him backing nerf was giga weird
[2:52:10] smolderdaddyuwu: upvoting now.
[2:52:11] infraredpen: I enjoyed the vid
[2:52:13] Qubuuuu: fronk KEKBye

[2:52:24] fronkacean: never too late
[2:52:26] SpectreWolf24: i watched it this morning its got a good ending/ take away.
[2:52:26] EFFSIN: i ate that shit up every second
[2:52:26] sep514: @Maximum honestly it was probably good to get posted. People are going to be weird about drama and its a way to try and take a more neutral approach especially having people on to talk about it
[2:52:26] Aro725: @Benefitzs_ well then you got 3 more to go before he sees it
[2:52:27] Outk_Ripper: Class discords can turn into echo chambers quickly I reckon
[2:52:27] Rampo123: on ur yt
[2:52:29] whatisthistwitchlol: have a celebrity boxing match vs him
[2:52:30] bigpharma___: you new here?
[2:52:30] AHart101: let fronk cook
[2:52:33] leubinator: dorki coming into the call for the memes was great
[2:52:33] Vaellder: dollarbucks are dollarbucks
[2:52:34] reggiepowa: become asmongold
[2:52:35] niji: please dont me drama youtuber
[2:52:35] Orang3joose: I watched it already so you can take it down
[2:52:35] mobbo: need some tegridy weed
[2:52:36] chefdejour82: please dont
[2:52:37] Lars_Keizer: EZ fronk bagging
[2:52:37] JakeParkbench: I do think it was a good topic for like shoot calling andgroup stress
[2:52:40] CoffeeASAP: Maxmongold
[2:52:42] Suited_Monkey: We'll call you minimum then Kappa
[2:52:42] Squats3: the asmongold of wow

[2:52:42] Aosin_: money or integrity. call it
[2:52:45] Aizen_NP: common fronk w
[2:52:46] MemphisGamingTTV: Not going to lie, it was interesting to see everything. I would have liked to see a conclusion where everything got resolved in a discord call or something
[2:52:46] Squats3: because he doesnt play the game anymore
[2:52:51] felwink: fronk was in the mines for the class tier video, let him get a quick bag
[2:52:53] LeSnapcasteur: didnt you just not stream much before outside of rwf? just do that or be ok with being TMZ
[2:52:53] stelfbronco: would you ever play demo lock
[2:52:54] Madgeneto: @Squats3 lmao
[2:52:57] ThisIzD: Fronks gotta eat Max. Let him cook.
[2:52:57] reymargera: SNIFFA someone say drama
[2:53:00] ambiotic: it ended up being a good lesson on how to navigate groups and outlook on why people could be mad vs drama
[2:53:16] gretriku: you didnt slander anyone so you did well
[2:53:23] Squats3: @Maximum yeah i mean you did say JPC was being a lil bitch
[2:53:26] platy_dev: im just waiting for the asmon reaction to your video so I can watch it
[2:53:33] TFT_Fiora: @Squats3 HOLY
[2:53:37] Calebkaser: fronks latest tweet is hilarious
[2:53:37] stelfbronco: @maximum how do you become the top 1#
[2:53:44] stelfbronco: 1%
[2:53:47] Drohgoh: JPC was based.
[2:53:48] keroblade: If Nerf had taken accountability at all it would have been way better
[2:53:50] Outk_Ripper: You were the most middle of the road person involved imo, you gave the benefit of the doubt to everyone
[2:53:51] mi_dude: good im almost 30 bit at the start

[3:03:01] AnesthesiaFC: lol, i cant see how any game besides BG3 could have won
[3:03:01] AerinClouds: @zarroe this is a pretty boring zone though hah

[3:03:10] Thoreya: bfa zones were so good

[3:03:41] jonlukk: bg3 yeeah
[3:03:41] m_dep: it is
[3:03:42] Branyawn: BG3 would be sooo hype
[3:03:42] AndersTheMad: Jedi survivor had so many issues for ps5 and still do lol
[3:03:43] ShabsieAU: its goated
[3:03:43] stelfbronco: @maximum why do you never do any story in a video game
[3:03:44] Joriku: it is
[3:03:45] gwenmh: duo bg3 with shroud or something
[3:03:46] m_dep: it is better than you think
[3:03:46] KaisenSiru: BG3 Pog
[3:03:48] Mirhi: It is
[3:03:48] mrhighway7: turn based is so good
[3:03:48] MrColvr: it is and i never liked turned based before bg3
[3:03:49] grevior: it is
[3:03:50] Branyawn: If you like to strat
[3:03:52] m_dep: I would assume I would hate it but its amazing
[3:03:52] geo2340: It is goated, but it takes ages when there are a lot of mobs
[3:03:53] Slapsstick: if you can get into it then it is sick af'
[3:03:55] kj01a: The turn based strategy is goated
[3:03:55] reggiepowa: for me it's the biggest turn off
[3:03:55] spinachdipminiatures: I always hated turn based game play but BG3 makes it great
[3:03:55] TheBroCrow: balding goat 3 is p good
[3:03:59] PuzzleMonkey: game is giga long though
[3:04:00] MemphisGamingTTV: Work emails are turn based combat
[3:04:00] ShabsieAU: @Maximum do a blind honour mode BG3 run
[3:04:09] Gunnthunder: @Maximum its super fun especcially if you just jump into honor or tactician, thats what im doing.
[3:04:15] nellfin: isn't bg3 just reading a book with some turn based combat sprinkled in?
[3:04:16] W1shb0n3: bg3 100%
[3:04:17] spinachdipminiatures: that is basically BG3
[3:04:18] gwenmh: you 100% can
[3:04:18] Branyawn: let chat make the decisions
[3:04:23] mobbo: @Maximum Do not play Persona 3 then... its going to be like 40 hours of cutscenes probably
[3:04:24] Zaisx: should play lies of p
[3:04:24] OG_Kawngi: are you into Yakuza/Like a Dragon?
[3:04:25] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/ar9b1P
[3:04:28] bigchurchman: dragonriding is peak content
[3:04:32] panser_nes: you can interrupt any conversation by attacking
[3:04:34] Joriku: you should play baldurs gate with someone maybe, not alone
[3:04:34] W1shb0n3: play tactician so decisions matter
[3:04:34] m_dep: the cutscene and story decisions ARE the gameplay for those games
[3:04:35] Ikillubad: we love lore here
[3:04:40] Cycore: You can make combat more engaging with mods, otherwise it's a bit slow paced
[3:04:45] caldricus: no reason to play bg3 if u skip cutscenes
[3:04:48] notSobar: BG3 is all about the narrative and how you change it, and then the narrator scolds you for it
[3:04:50] gwenmh: i feel like you would like dragon's dogma
[3:04:53] m_dep: this shit is TV show / movie quality. Mocap for facial expressions and everything, amazing voice actors
[3:04:53] OG_Kawngi: video games are the worst story telling medium of the bunch
[3:04:53] stelfbronco: @maximum you can get down and dirty with a bear😐
[3:05:05] enigmasvea: diablo 4 s3 and palworld
[3:05:06] HyvenVibin: Baldurs Gate is 50/50 gameplay  cutscene the major draw is the high quality storytelling and dialogue
[3:05:10] JakeParkbench: have you played armored core 6?
[3:05:13] grevior: @maximum bg3 is made for you then. it is chaos incarnate. just make sure you’re playing the hardest mode so you don’t steamroll it
[3:05:18] MrColvr: BG3 is the exception
[3:05:20] yooyoo1337: baldur who?
[3:05:22] m_dep: agreed. BG3 tho IS AMAZING at storytelling
[3:05:23] lorddustdevil: did you talk about blizzard shafting shamans
[3:05:28] babaqboy: lets say some games
[3:05:30] HakiThunderFox: I love bg3 gameplay
[3:05:30] nationas: the gameplay is ok
[3:05:30] AppleOnVacation: if you are always skipping it how will you ever find the good ones though
[3:05:34] Branyawn: Slay the Spire run?
[3:05:35] gunshinsora: @Maximum 100% agreed if i want story i do books, gameplay is more imp in games
[3:05:38] notSobar: I want the narrator from Baldur's Gate 3 to narrate my life for a day.
[3:05:38] m_dep: this is novel/tv/movie tier 100%
[3:05:40] Fray24_: I am writing a really long twitter thread on you for that
[3:05:42] HakiThunderFox: I quit witcher 3 because their combat is ass
[3:05:44] thumpper__: I think there are some games that do story better than tv though
[3:05:46] Varae__: How can you say it's significantly worse if you are skipping the narrative aspects
[3:05:52] gunshinsora: novels and books are my go to for stories
[3:05:53] grevior: also you can make the ugliest characters
[3:05:54] LeSnapcasteur: What is your opinion on the legendary? Am I a baby for being upset I still don't have it as a high-end player and 450ilvl alts have it, or is the acquisition process still shit?
[3:05:59] Luquesti: so fucking bad
[3:06:01] gunshinsora: when a game has great story and shit combat i leave
[3:06:05] Mirhi: hard agree with witcher 3 combat being terrible
[3:06:16] kelly_mac06: man i would pay money to see Max react to the Baldur's Gate 3 Character creation stuff and the new "realistic physics"
[3:06:21] morfiga26: it's not terrible but isn't good either
[3:06:23] felwink: if the new witcher game has soulsborne combat its gonna be so lit
[3:06:25] rustycans: You guys are cooking something if you think thats bad
[3:06:30] malnourish_: im baby
[3:06:31] Gunnthunder: @Maximum im enjoying bg3 combat, the character building and tactics especcially on higher difficulties is shockingly indepth
[3:06:34] jonlukk: it was def bad for the time we already had dark souls
[3:06:37] LeSnapcasteur: bad luck protection is a meme.
[3:06:39] Ehsanfury: witcher 3 was 11 years ago Aware
[3:06:43] LeSnapcasteur: oh 30 sec ad rip
[3:06:47] Orang3joose: im literally 480 and still dont have it
[3:06:48] lucory: hard agree amen
[3:06:59] Cycore: Drop chance is abysmal, only ~12% of ALL player with AotC or higher have it... 3 months into the patch KEKW
[3:06:59] MemphisGamingTTV: legendary is a small small increase. That being said, I got mine on my alt on the 3rd week so idk
[3:07:00] KaisenSiru: Killed M Fyrakk and dont have it still
[3:07:00] Baskkov: I got after 6 heroic clears
[3:07:09] rustycans: souls is worse than witcher, oh look I hit once or twice then roll wow great combat
[3:07:13] rainp: I got it this monday
[3:07:13] cheados: it's so bad
[3:07:15] smolderdaddyuwu: I have 14.. greater ember  to my toon
[3:07:15] kmaclol: Got my weekly raid finder right now for another crack, having an absolute blast /s
[3:07:17] shadwosw: And it tuned based on you get the legendary, lmao
[3:07:17] JansonLives: nobody in our guild has it yet
[3:07:27] cheados: ive killed heroic every week but first and still haven't gotten it
[3:07:29] AndersTheMad: @Maximum guildie of mine got the lego for evoker 3 weeks before 10.2
[3:07:29] notSobar: The priest lego ring never dropped for me from Anduin
[3:07:29] gouldinglol: only 1 person in my guild has it
[3:07:32] LeSnapcasteur: even with the lego we are medium lmao
[3:07:37] Horisafit87: I still haven't gotten it either
[3:07:37] majkdragon: I never saw the Evoker ledgendary to get
[3:07:37] panta_xdd: the quest sucks to, to much to do, who has the patience
[3:07:37] AnesthesiaFC: my guild has seen 1 this entire tier, multiple people at 485+ running normal heroic and lfr every week
[3:07:38] Madgeneto: @notSobar wasnt a lego
[3:07:40] mandbyvgc: it is crazy I might get burnt out of M+ before I get the lego
[3:07:42] InvdrZim13: 8-9 weeks in without getting it just feels bad, like I'm not even gonna be happy to get it at this point
[3:07:43] Onyo1337: our raiders so far got 1 legendary, meanwhile 3 socials got it last 2 weeks, its stupid
[3:07:43] Lindorn_: we have 2 but 1 is a holy pally :)
[3:07:47] Codester_remix: Should have it at least a month in
[3:07:51] kalatia: guilds holy pally who doesn't ret got it before any dps lol
[3:07:52] lucory: they should honestly be able to show you what your personal percentage going into the fight of getting it at least imo
[3:07:58] Mythykk: same. we have 3 groups that full clear and have 1 leggo
[3:08:05] ExCodix: yup ;)
[3:08:07] relentless5150: im 487 on my ret without it. and ive been doing everything to increase my chances to get it, never have, but I boost some random 420 frost dk and he gets it first try actually beyond cringe.
[3:08:23] notSobar: @Madgeneto About the closest a priest will get to a lego though
[3:08:25] Cycore: @Maximum only ~12% of players with AotC and higher have the legendary after 3 months LUL
[3:08:34] Gravixx: Have you played Ghost of Tsushima? That's a goated game both gameplay and narrative-wise
[3:08:38] jonlukk: i got it so i think its amazing :)
[3:08:46] Hoshma46: @InvdrZim13 bro it's gonna be a sense of relief for it being over instead of happiness
[3:08:47] muonz: its 1.5 months btw
[3:08:53] Cycore: that's the actual number
[3:08:55] bynded: @Maximum only ~13% of players with AotC and higher have the legendary after 3 months LUL
[3:09:03] smolderdaddyuwu: do you think the leggo will become impossible to craft at some point? @Maximum
[3:09:04] ritsrawr: ritsrawr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[3:09:05] Baskkov: and then he quit

[4:31:44] OG_Kawngi: my dad stays hate watching fox news all day
[4:31:48] Standy94: That’s me!
[4:31:49] zeitgeiz: it's rough
[4:31:56] anmusallam: mainstream news are throwing their credibility alone
[4:31:59] OG_Kawngi: Q monkaW
[4:32:01] Slapsstick: I wont be able to talk to my grandparents this year, they are extremely opinionated but dont research anything so its like talking to a wall
[4:32:05] gretriku: my dad used to be hard addicted to fox news, luckily we had an intervention and he stopped watching all of that shit
[4:32:09] Arvakr: its entertaining
[4:32:13] Ok_Kingston: I love the new conspiracy that Michelle Obama is a man. BIG MIKE
[4:32:15] nationas: you have to lean into it
[4:32:17] OG_Kawngi: the documentaries about family members being lost to Q Anon is so sad
[4:32:20] acadiian: my family sent me masks at the start of covid, then made fun of me for wearing it when trump said it was fake.
[4:32:20] Standy94: The moon is flat!
[4:32:21] comsok: American elections feels like echo/liquid reddit during RWF

[4:32:32] yooyoo1337: everything I believe is the truth.
[4:32:33] Alarius_: hype or just depressing?
[4:32:35] lolFluke: bro there is nothing better than moon fake types
[4:32:38] Ikillubad: I don't get the space isn't real thing
[4:32:42] Standy94: I’m a flat mooner
[4:32:44] Rekrian: are you more liberal or conservative?
[4:32:47] kino_xo: I mean it was one thing that they just believe it but now they act on it and its not hype anymore its kinda dangerous tbh
[4:32:50] caveman2x: my conspiracy is blizzard is trolling with leggo drops .. twice in my guild once to bdk 2nd time hpal
[4:32:53] JackOfAllApocalypses: it's just depressing
[4:32:54] Vordie: The biggest issue is 99% of conspiracy theories end up being connected to anti-semetism and that's the dangerous, non fun part.
[4:32:58] Ok_Kingston: Michelle Obama is a man is the best new consiracy. Her name is Big Mike and she mind reads
[4:33:01] nationas: you have to one up them so they look at you like damn thats too far
[4:33:26] MemphisGamingTTV: to be fair, mk ultra was a conspiracy until it was proven to be true
[4:33:26] nationas: LUL
[4:33:28] carmlost: I did some digging on the 100% fatal strain. They released their findings in a medical journal it’s not cloak and dagger shit. Additionally, something rapidly lethal is bad at spreading. Just eat your tendies and stop playing augmentation
[4:33:29] anmusallam: its easier than you think max
[4:33:30] invictus_DK: Maintenance again today?
[4:33:34] CoffeeASAP: yeah you'd just give them new ideas lol

[4:34:13] wow_noboat: Max is officially canceled by trumpers. calling it

[4:34:30] Standy94: Those people also think you’re insane
[4:34:34] keinplan_exe: as an 18yo that has to live with the consequences of the bullshit going on rn the only way of coping is to just laugh about the whole thing
[4:34:35] Richthofen187: KKona
[4:34:36] CoachFrankFromSkate3: we need a politicians tier list to help the people vote
[4:34:41] Celynae: is it possible to be against both without accidentally supporting one?
[4:34:52] Slapsstick: I agree, i tend to be very centrist about topics but all politicians are a giga struggle rn
[4:34:54] Ikillubad: throw it all in the trash, both sides suck
[4:34:57] zeitgeiz: both sides are memes, it's all bad
[4:35:00] BmwMk6: Toss this one at your next conspiracy meeting lol - you need a large % base of poor people in order to have a functional economy. So, the conspiracy theory goes that the government has to ensure the a majority stays poor.
[4:35:00] nationas: thats the big truth
[4:35:01] Vordie: Yea until you get money out of politics, you're wasting your time
[4:35:05] anmusallam: lobbying should be illegal

[4:35:31] chadworld77: you literally just described half the country as being in a cult, i dont think you get to be like "im not attached to politics" lol
[4:35:35] spamburger_hamburger: Anyone that would be a great president isn't dumb enough to want to be president
[4:35:39] MrAndersen_: lobbying should be illegal but its influence is way overblown
[4:35:46] Marz311: the 2 party system kinda sucks.

[4:36:15] pooksterlive: Thoughts on the borderlands game franchise
[4:36:18] Arvakr: the news SUCKS
[4:36:20] Shadowbaine36: it doesnt take a political expert to see the culty-ness of it
[4:36:22] Richthofen187: fishh
[4:36:26] lolFluke: doesnt like 40% of Americans not vote
[4:36:31] Vordie: If the person you follow is above the law and can do no wrong, then yea, you in a cult bud.

[4:36:35] Celynae: lets be real, a bunch of m+ community is pretty culty sometimes
[4:36:39] kurleth: Remember when the whole internet would talk about things like Athene's cult, good times
[4:36:45] Ok_Kingston: found the trumper lmao
[4:36:46] TurkTurkelton: in any country worth existing, politics should be a background thought and not a primary focus in day-to-day life. because it implies that they have their shit together.
[4:36:50] Standy94: Would you sign Donald Trump to play BM Hunter ?
[4:36:59] highcard2: i think last election was like a 50% turnout which was a record high
[4:37:01] Wildfire_Gaming: the only time i voted was to legalize weed in my state
[4:37:05] JordoOCE: Make it compulsory like Australia
[4:37:07] Ikillubad: a number of countries have compulsory voting
[4:37:09] nationas: australia its mandatory voting
[4:37:14] plasma32: The best thing about Texas is California still has more guns and Texas can't figure out how.
[4:37:14] Celynae: @JordoOCE amen
[4:37:20] OG_Kawngi: was 61% in 2020
[4:37:20] gretriku: old people are the only ones that consistently vote, its a big reason why we've gotten to where we are
[4:37:22] Arvakr: I bet there are some people right now absolutly fumming at your stream
[4:37:25] Slapsstick: it was a pretty big shit show
[4:37:25] Ikillubad: Luxembourg is too
[4:37:28] Domekowski: my country had like a 70% attendance in most recent one i think
[4:37:31] TheBroCrow: do you think voting should be mandatory
[4:37:38] Vordie: Making it compulsory is equally wrong, you're forcing people to vote for things they know nothing about.
[4:37:42] Archmage_Michael: if you don't vote, you can't complain later imo
[4:37:43] BmwMk6: Modern politics is more akin to the NFL than actual leadership
[4:37:44] Standy94: Well there’s a decent percentage that can’t vote
[4:37:45] realmattu: technically that means most voters chose no president so honestly the republic should dissolve
[4:37:46] bpguns: need mandatory voting with mandatory time off for voting
[4:37:48] Warzam: 50% is so low for a democratic country
[4:37:51] krimsonhooker: im fuming Madge
[4:37:58] HooDGorE: only the cultist are fuming
[4:38:05] CoffeeASAP: I'm cozy
[4:38:11] Vordie: This was the last straw for me im out

[4:38:17] TheTimoBern: chat is entertaining today PopCorn
[4:38:20] kogin1: hey max, will you adopt me?
[4:38:21] GramadinGG: I don't think the government forcing people to do something is the answer... just my thought
[4:38:23] Standy94: Max confirms Team Liquid voted for Biden
[4:38:24] VRVento: i watch the most far right and far left shit and laugh

[4:38:33] lsdeeezus: in Denmark it's above 80% every election
[4:38:41] samadcit: When you say "ill vote for a guy even when he's a convicted criminal".... you've lost the thread... you gone... full cult
[4:38:41] lolFluke: Max what's your thoughts on space, you give the vibe of a big space guy
[4:38:44] anmusallam: i heard that america used to have more than 2 parties
[4:38:44] ylisse7: filthy casual
[4:38:47] Slapsstick: one of my favorite things my ap gov teacher told me was that the political spectrum isnt a line, its a horseshoe and the farther you go to either side the closer you get to each other
[4:38:55] Standy94: Who cares about Denmark?
[4:38:57] gwenmh: biden is a centrist lmao
[4:38:59] Brohdin: @bpguns Agree that election day should be a national holiday, but would prefer those uninformed aren't required to vote
[4:38:59] Marz311: 2 party system gives independents no chance to win.
[4:39:01] bpguns: they won't even get past the primary
[4:39:05] Shadowbaine36: too many people just blindly vote party lines regardless of the stances they support
[4:39:07] Celynae: party preferred and alliances, in Australia helps with that kind of idea
[4:39:13] CoffeeASAP: yeah there are a lot of independants that juts vote of the least crazy of the two sides lol
[4:39:15] SheapRocka: nope we got loke 40 partys xD
[4:39:17] samadcit: Biden is a centrist for sure
[4:39:18] bpguns: @Brohdin yea in theory, not ok in reality
[4:39:20] Ok_Kingston: never vote, i refuse to participate in a system that doesnt represent me
[4:39:21] lolFluke: Biden is right wing to basically any other democracy
[4:39:22] CptPinkeye: @Standy94 probably a few Danish people I would have thought..
[4:39:23] Doomtree71: People will say you "waste" your vote if you vote independent
[4:39:23] Archmage_Michael: It's weird that the US only has 2 parties. In Europe parliaments often have 5-7 parties and coalitions have to be formed
[4:39:23] lsdeeezus: @Standy94  terrible take, ur country is literal garbo x)
[4:39:24] comsok: @Standy94 people who care about politics
[4:39:25] honeychonker: @Maximum the smaller centrist parties have a lot of sway because they can form minority governments because we have 5 different parties here
[4:39:29] Rekrian: Horde or Alliance?
[4:39:29] headninja1ncharge: Thats what Arnold did
[4:39:35] gwenmh: literally every demo president has been a centrist since fdr
[4:39:39] jword1: the president should be determined by who can hold the most pizza's
[4:39:48] honeychonker: usually they make demands in return for voting with another party

[4:40:08] CoffeeASAP: @jword1 like in their hands? are we talking boxes or slices?

[4:44:30] Slapsstick: @Slapsstick maybe its just the mutual respect from making england upset forever ago then. We still homies even if you ruined the internet
[4:44:34] Brohdin: Twitch turbo, even after the price hike is turbo OP tbh
[4:44:37] lathander557: @chadworld77 No one is going to take you seriously being a repub apologist on a streaming platform, you should post this on facebook instead
[4:44:39] phemii: come to germany, u have no job u have more money then people who work Kappa
[4:44:43] VRVento: it seems like the twitch audiance is getting used to it too
[4:44:47] CoffeeASAP: just sub or get turbo EZ
[4:44:59] oahai4: i just get turbo
[4:45:01] tykus21: Thats how they get you max, slowly brainwash you
[4:45:04] Adrang: wait what ads?
[4:45:13] UnheardGrace: yo if I didn't have ad-free on this channel I'd quit twitch
[4:45:18] xxpurplehazen: i watch 8 hours of twitch every day turbo is clutch
[4:45:24] chadworld77: @lathander557 i am not a republican
[4:45:24] Standy94: Turbo
[4:45:27] HooDGorE: if you watch twitch without turbo, thats swamp ass
[4:45:28] chadworld77: but okay
[4:45:48] anmusallam: get that bag i cant blame any1
[4:46:03] sysfantasm: So Twitch-contract turned out to be a liability in that case? Wooow that sucks
[4:46:10] CoffeeASAP: get that bag
[4:46:12] CoffeeASAP: yup lol
[4:46:16] phemii: just come to germany for free money for doing nothing at all Kappa
[4:46:30] KineasRM: still, by pick and choosing the streamers on the program, it insentivised other ppl to do it too, and in the end twitch made a bunch of money
[4:46:39] Standy94: People used to run like 10 mins of ads at end of streams
[4:46:43] acekongtv: where is he flying? that place is nice
[4:46:50] OG_Kawngi: twitch still not profitable
[4:46:52] litixio: and if everyone just. bought turbo the problem would be solved
[4:46:57] chadworld77: people should get paid, im glad to see the ads from good streamers. idk its what it is
[4:47:04] CoffeeASAP: @AceKongTV Stormsong Valley in BfA
[4:47:10] Jjmn12: @AceKongTV Kul Tiras
[4:47:11] acekongtv: @AceKongTV thx
[4:47:11] Ok_Kingston: turbo pog
[4:47:18] VRVento: everything is going back to ads because there is so much money in it. Everything is just turning back into cable tv.
[4:47:21] phemii: u can also stream doing nothing in germany and get even more money Kappa
[4:47:29] sysfantasm: Twitch is one big loss leader lol
[4:47:35] anmusallam: would that be kick platform
[4:47:39] Slapsstick: if twitch prime leaves I leave
[4:47:41] OG_Kawngi: please not kick
[4:47:42] WQKPtheDON: i like turbo
[4:47:49] EFFSIN: No other service has a thing like twice prime so if they got rid of it why would people switch>
[4:47:52] anmusallam: idk the streaming services tbh
[4:47:56] GhostdadUC: GhostdadUC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:47:58] Mezzedii: why do they care if they arent profitable amazon is worth 1.56 trillion dollars
[4:48:01] chadworld77: kick looks like a pr0n to me lmao
[4:48:03] NeorgLeVrai: It would be Youtube, Youtube is already a huge streaming plateform
[4:48:05] CoffeeASAP: lol
[4:48:05] GhostdadUC: thanks for reminding me about the prime
[4:48:09] acekongtv: finals of what
[4:48:12] chimneybob: Microsoft needs to bring mixer back lol
[4:48:18] Vordie: Kick is straight up blocked in Greece, you cannot access it AT ALL.
[4:48:18] chadworld77: makes twitch look relatively normal
[4:48:30] MemphisGamingTTV: isn’t kick like bleeding money?
[4:48:40] fronkacean: twitch chat is unironically just carrying twitch
[4:48:40] phemii: why is KinderBueno now 3,49€? :(
[4:48:42] sysfantasm: Microsoft could afford not to turn a profit on WoW, no? I hope Satya Nadella helps revamp their game department.
[4:48:44] Arcoh_: kick is a loss leader for crypto gambling
[4:48:48] EFFSIN: u think if mixer bought more streamers they would be alive still
[4:49:00] Arcoh_: kicks convesion rate to their crypto gambling site is like 5%
[4:49:04] KineasRM: twitch prob makes its money on deals, its kinda running worlds or Proscene for lol, they actually lose money on the thing itself but the ad deals pays it all and make the brand keep its relanvancy
[4:49:04] CoffeeASAP: I'm pretty sure i saw an article yesterday that twitch CEO said they are also bleeding money
[4:49:20] xhriiis: @fronkacean yea if youtube chat was usable maybe people would watch that more but it’s so bad
[4:49:27] Vordie: Kick is bleeding money but their incentive is not to make money through Kick, but through Stake
[4:49:32] justdavesadly: justdavesadly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[4:49:34] Arcoh_: ^^^
[4:49:41] EFFSIN: not if all the gambling ads still support them
[4:49:46] creatlach: also owned by STAKE
[4:50:00] Arcoh_: big true
[4:50:04] phemii: Döner back in the good ol' times was like 3,50 and now u get Kinder Bueno for it :(
[4:50:09] sysfantasm: I feel like it's getting almost impossible for some reason to turn a profit in media due to all-out competition. It's the new restuarant business.
[4:50:34] creatlach: its also crypto gambling which isnt regulated
[4:50:43] vellic4: Kick has a fraction of the costs due to much smaller employee base so they probably dont need as much to be profitable also
[4:51:10] highcard2: prob under 10%
[4:51:10] Arcoh_: Kick is hosted on AWS is a little funny
[4:51:15] sysfantasm: crypto gambling... that's really sad stuff man
[4:51:19] EFFSIN: u think its equal 2 twitch tho?
[4:51:20] OG_Kawngi: didnt twitch recently lay off 35% of staff
[4:51:25] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/ar9b1P
[4:51:26] Vordie: Yeap
[4:51:34] Arcoh_: gamba stream when Max
[4:51:36] creatlach: yes, unregulated as well
[4:51:36] xhriiis: server cost must be the most of it
[4:51:36] nationas: thats crazy
[4:51:42] Brohdin: Wages are often 40-50% of a business' expenses - no idea about twitch though
[4:51:47] CoffeeASAP: is that like buying fake money to spend to gamble?
[4:51:48] lathander557: Liquid Guild NFTs when
[4:51:53] nationas: so you gamble with volatile crypto xD
[4:51:54] droxfo: There's plenty of gambling on twitch as well, they literally only banned stake gambling
[4:52:09] Vordie: NFTs era was so funny
[4:52:13] Ukahen: methodverse
[4:52:14] fronkacean: i think that was a blockchain game?
[4:52:20] OG_Kawngi: Method MetaGuild
[4:52:30] EFFSIN: Get in touch with stake 2 host a esports gambling on the next race 2 world first Kappa
[4:52:34] feeras_gg: btw what happened to nfts did they all just dissapear or did their value drop to zero
[4:52:51] VRVento: crypto seems pretty ok though still right
[4:52:58] CoffeeASAP: yup
[4:53:06] CoffeeASAP: get in and get out
[4:53:13] ca_Y_z: i'll stay here
[4:53:16] ca_Y_z: its getting heavy
[4:53:16] anmusallam: i still dont understand how people fell for NFT's
[4:53:18] Brohdin: When over half the population is talking about an "investment" get out immediately
[4:53:20] Ralykx: Ralykx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Thanks for all the fun!
[4:53:23] nationas: big time
[4:53:23] OG_Kawngi: all the apes are gone!
[4:53:24] Ukahen: pump and dumps
[4:53:29] lathander557: The bigger cryptos are still doing fine but the thousands that were created on the big guys' coattails just crashed and continue to burn
[4:53:31] feeras_gg: that nft art looked so ugly
[4:53:38] Evalend_: Folding Ideas video on NFT's dispelled all doubts I had about that stuff being a turbo scam
[4:53:41] Marz311: that FTX guy that he was smart
[4:53:44] ca_Y_z: its a global matter however the us politics are forced to shift
[4:53:45] StoringStories: NFTs were MLMs for dudebros
[4:53:48] Marz311: thought i mean
[4:53:54] Hoshma46: TrollDespair
[4:53:59] VRVento: crypto is basically a pyramid scheme at its core get in early make the most
[4:53:59] s_thetic_steve: lots capitalized on it, but i said before that NFT only had as much value as people put on them, no actual value. supply and demand and such, the base of it was nothing
[4:54:08] Plague_GG: the US tax system is the greatest scam in modern history towCopium  Kappa
[4:54:09] ca_Y_z: it hurts to hear about
[4:54:10] iloveuminkey: woooooweeeeeee
[4:54:13] santalylth: how would you rate 10.2 overall
[4:54:31] MemphisGamingTTV: to be fair, after the first crypto scam if you continued to buy into creator back coins, that’s your own fault
[4:54:58] sysfantasm: I feel there's also a trendline of big streamers being less personal with their audiences, because YT, streaming has been so commercialised. Most creators maintain arm's length distance to their audiences, for good reasons, but it sorta sucks too.
[4:55:00] fronkacean: to this day probably
[4:55:01] ylisse7: we're just super smart
[4:55:03] TheBroCrow: HAH crypto bro
[4:55:04] CoffeeASAP: FF14 players had a pre-revolt against sqnex because of NFTs haha
[4:55:08] ca_Y_z: couldnt agree more
[4:55:09] Alarius_: sponsored by coinbase tho
[4:55:19] Vordie: The Trump NFTs were *LIIIIIT*
[4:55:19] Brohdin: Isn't smash notoriously not profitable, so maybe people thought it was more excusable
[4:55:23] feeras_gg: !discord
[4:55:23] StreamElements: https://discord.gg/EPHq4vUDuu or try !liquidcord
[4:55:35] Dahhaka: I got scammed out of my Runescape account when I was 13 years old and it taught me to spot scams ever since.
[4:55:35] highcard2: yeah but you can't say that dumb people deserve to be scammed tho lol
[4:55:38] UnheardGrace: falling for a scam doesn't make you stupid, it makes you a victim
[4:55:43] Hoshma46: class action lawsuit savixNodders
[4:55:43] honeychonker: Its the same as old ladies being scammed out their bank details, would you blame the old lady with dementia?
[4:55:44] MemphisGamingTTV: but coinbase is still based am I right
[4:55:44] Vordie: Please tell me you've seen the Trump NFTs (official) @Maximum
[4:55:48] CoffeeASAP: Speaking of, I got my Liquid Derp shirt
[4:55:51] CoffeeASAP: very cozy
[4:55:53] FraggyP: it’s not our fault people have low IQ though or anyone’s really
[4:55:59] sysfantasm: I just remember the Winklevoss brothers buying Eth or Btc or something. It's outright evil stuff to fool people into financial disarray.
[4:55:59] lathander557: People are used to having some kind of consumer protection but with crypto, the deregulation is the name of the game so it just wasn't thought through that way
[4:56:06] xhriiis: yea isn’t liquid sponsored by coinbase
[4:56:06] s_thetic_steve: your audience never would have fell for it if you tried ot @Maximum  we too smart
[4:56:09] SMRyan: dude runescape was the biggest scam test for young people back in the day
[4:56:11] anmusallam: the nft wave was insane
[4:56:17] xhriiis: quick sponsor check?
[4:56:22] OG_Kawngi: EZ
[4:56:23] AJbgodx: TRUEE
[4:56:25] lathander557: KEKW
[4:56:27] Malbroche: Doubt
[4:56:27] ca_Y_z: perhaps the greatest nation on earth
[4:56:27] Hoshma46: KEKW
[4:56:31] Dahhaka: @SMRyan omg Jagex blocks ur pass look! *******
[4:56:35] Vordie: Maybe that one guy would've
[4:56:35] BobAwesome: yea hsure
[4:56:37] ca_Y_z: so theres the potencial
[4:56:43] BoldrinXX: had a buddy buy heavy into GameStop when it was low and tried to convince me to but I didn’t. I played myself
[4:56:48] VRVento: HUH
[4:56:49] Starforkx: nah dawg, we're still wow players, we're all still dumb asf
[4:56:50] Vordie: We'd also be very quick to shit on you.
[4:56:53] OG_Kawngi: High IQ chat ok
[4:57:02] Artenuous: mmo players are very skeptical of shit from my experience
[4:57:02] margin777: what has more value: krypto or buying a boost ? Kappa
[4:57:10] CoachFrankFromSkate3: Max's audience = elite
[4:57:19] CoffeeASAP: we all know you tolerate us at best lol
[4:57:23] UnheardGrace: nah we still have a parasocial relationship, we just know you're human
[4:57:26] Malbroche: arent you my best friend?
[4:57:28] lathander557: But did logan or jake paul lead any guilds to world firsts? Checkmate, internet gods
[4:57:28] Marz311: were too old and know better lol
[4:57:29] iiamBaro: ricegum EWWW
[4:57:36] captainkirbal: I do. :)
[4:57:38] variareturns: You also don't entertain weird behavior from your chat to keep them engaged.
[4:57:41] Vordie: You'd be surprised, people form parasocial relationships through weird shit
[4:57:43] NotQuid: you mean we're not homies?
[4:57:46] UnheardGrace: you said my name one time, we're best friends
[4:57:46] santalylth: are we not best friends?
[4:57:47] regular_rusty: Older? like 30 something?
[4:57:49] Hoshma46: YEP
[4:57:49] Mactub: @Maximum what are you talking about? don't you know we're best friends?
[4:57:50] Vordie: 100% we would.
[4:57:51] xhriiis: we are just here for the dogs let’s be real max
[4:57:52] CoffeeASAP: yeah lol
[4:57:52] logicaltty: HAH
[4:57:52] GhostdadUC: We're best friends and i'd give you hundreds of dollars if you told me
[4:57:52] YungBeepBoop: wait @Maximum you arent coming to my birthday?
[4:57:53] Atsri: do you know what the average age of your audience is? just curious
[4:57:54] lolFluke: watching your fly around is scratching my brain like some wicked asmr
[4:57:58] lessahj: HAH
[4:57:58] Gogglez: for sure
[4:58:01] Slapsstick: HAH all stream
[4:58:01] sysfantasm: You know, I love this sort of stream man, just flying around and talking, chat babbling. It's not a parasocial thing, it's just a nice content format tbh.
[4:58:02] nationas: only thd has my idolatry
[4:58:07] Ikillubad: wait, are we getting an uno reverse card? Is he about to launch his coin?
[4:58:07] ca_Y_z: i like to think in generations
[4:58:11] ca_Y_z: it does bind us
[4:58:12] Starforkx: i feel like i have a parasocial relationship with you max, i got a rwf liquid shirt with your face on it multiple times
[4:58:12] anmusallam: i think with some communities, they have a problem of overglorification
[4:58:13] Horghi: Horseboy is my hero
[4:58:21] MemphisGamingTTV: you’d instantly get HAH’d
[4:58:28] nesia2: the only thing that could make this stream even better is if dratnos was here
[4:58:28] ciggyman: i feel like i have a parasocial relationship with you max, i got a rwf liquid shirt with your face on it multiple times
[4:58:30] derdian12: For those saying those folks were dumb / deserved it. The reality is people were promised something else and got rug pulled, you can say that they were gullible for believing but we have a word for what they did. Its fraud, and they are 1 million percent at fault
[4:58:39] Starforkx: fr though, all the liquid merch i got is sick asf
[4:58:42] Vordie: It would just instantly lower people's view of you immediately
[4:58:45] cajovysacok: i think NA people get more likely manipulate then EU people
[4:59:02] Hoshma46: no one deserves to be put on a pedestal
[4:59:03] Vordie: Ludwig's "I'm not your friend" video was good on that
[4:59:15] nationas: e.g. if you were asmon flying around in wow you would have 50 ppl following you
[4:59:17] chimneybob: what if that person is betty white
[4:59:19] nationas: thats weird af
[4:59:23] sysfantasm: The sad problem is that the people that most frequently hang on online platforms usually have no job, perhaps aren't in edu, etc.
[4:59:26] Brotholomew13: nah dude people are people
[4:59:28] nightst314: half of scandinavia finances OTK
[4:59:30] lolFluke: attacking my inner swiftie goes wild
[4:59:37] anmusallam: i think its more of a person thing than a region thing
[4:59:41] ylisse7: EU folks are less trusting of strangers, I think
[4:59:43] sysfantasm: As an EU guy, I think it's grossly wrong to think that NA people are somehow more naive ngl
[4:59:58] ca_Y_z: a bit generalized no
[5:00:05] Vordie: Increasing atomization of society + loneliness.
[5:00:07] Brotholomew13: @ylisse7 I don't know a lot of americans that are trusting of strangers
[5:00:07] captainkirbal: Horseboy is my friend :)
[5:00:08] OG_Kawngi: I think with AI voices in the future the amount of scams will ramp hard
[5:00:10] Ok_Kingston: USA USA USA
[5:00:14] Tegraine: i had my first message of the day pinned for a good 1/2 hour in your stream so I'm pretty sure we're bffs now
[5:00:20] ca_Y_z: cliches are a different story. they have their background
[5:00:22] nationas: naive tier list
[5:00:25] chimneybob: Eu have more laws against stupid news
[5:00:33] GhostdadUC: tragically brutal sounds like a T-Swift song
[5:00:34] iCarDog: unbelievably based
[5:00:35] ciraxa: hugeee fan of TSwift Kappa
[5:00:36] Vordie: What's a person whose personality is "I'm a Maximum fan"
[5:00:40] Hoshma46: I'm from kansas and she's dating travis kelce, so I basically know her Kappa
[5:00:41] nick08_wow: @Maximum it's crazy that this has been a just chatting stream with a subway surfer style dragonriding background since you've been on today. not complaining just stating facts.
[5:00:43] Hunaria: Disney adults
[5:00:45] MrAndersen_: if your personality is "i like this 1 thing" thats tragic
[5:00:50] AetherMana: what about the people that live their life around disney
[5:00:53] highcard2: maxies
[5:00:56] Brighterhood: but i exist
[5:00:58] fronkacean: Maximums
[5:00:58] EMCQable: challenge accepted
[5:01:03] Vordie: It'd be pretty fking funny you just tweet once a week and that's it
[5:01:03] lathander557: Chat do we start calling ourselves Maxies now or later
[5:01:03] Slapsstick: maxi pads? :)

[5:01:21] Maruika: hey your hockey pads are maxi pads
[5:01:22] viewsxx: maxipads
[5:01:23] Brohdin: Music makes sense, given how people put their emotions into their art
[5:01:27] Plague_GG: Maxletes
[5:01:27] domz_i: Didn't you sell a shirt with your face on it
[5:01:27] ciggyman: everyone knows faker
[5:01:30] s_thetic_steve: the grip that taylor swift has on her fans need to be studied, theyre wild
[5:01:31] GhostdadUC: Is it weird that you view us as a collective but we view you as a person?
[5:01:31] SaltyCreepa: whose faker
[5:01:31] nationas: hyper competitive people are usually very down to earth cos they take losses
[5:01:32] Ok_Kingston: I know Faker and im dumb american
[5:01:42] fronkacean: that guys the best thing to ever happen to league of legends

[5:02:40] Sch1ey: Method josh Kappa
[5:02:40] slinia: Payo
[5:02:42] CptPinkeye: the OG god rogue reckful used to be RIP D:
[5:02:43] ciggyman: best dj on twitch JMY
[5:02:45] ca_Y_z: certain nuances differ
[5:02:47] OG_Kawngi: Kungen Kappa
[5:02:50] lolFluke: I will stan starcraft Idra till I die
[5:02:57] nightst314: fragnance also was a complete douchbag towards treckie for years
[5:02:59] Marz311: reckful back in the days yeah rip :(
[5:03:01] fronkacean: feel like dorki has taken claim on the m+ viewers... gotta be some weird cat lovers in there
[5:03:02] CoffeeASAP: stoopzzHypersG
[5:03:15] nationas: @lolFluke idra artosis high five YT
[5:03:18] fronkacean: oh its completely how you interact with chat
[5:03:26] JordoOCE: Reckful for sure used to
[5:03:29] Starforkx: @fronkacean that just might be the internet
[5:03:37] highcard2: no its the way a streamer interacts with their audience that kinda dictates it
[5:03:38] Hoshma46: @fronkacean I just think the glasses cat images are hilarious
[5:03:39] Camelbak21: Streaming consistently is extremely important
[5:03:41] Brotholomew13: I would die for James (parady)
[5:03:42] realmattu: bro there's def a paradoxical thing withi the yoy
[5:03:42] xhriiis: jpc doesn’t stream enough
[5:03:49] lathander557: It completely depends on the way you talk to your chat yeah
[5:03:49] MarkoLee78: Theres one guy that literally screams this - Musclebrah
[5:03:51] Sch1ey: Any female streamer i bet
[5:03:56] jvmes_r6: jpc music playlist is A1
[5:03:58] realmattu: parasocial
[5:04:01] domz_i: @buffretpallys mitch
[5:04:01] ca_Y_z: muricans cherish success, defined by each person individually. its a healthy mindset
[5:04:04] ciggyman: jpc is legendary gamer, but im not going to jail for anyone lmao
[5:04:12] slinia: I feel like you just have a different type of parasocial fans and its most often during the race to world first when toxic race fans come in and cant fathom if a or b team won or loss
[5:04:12] cajovysacok: some peope just watch them because they have big audiance
[5:04:12] iCarDog: forsen
[5:04:20] destrostoo: Kungen
[5:04:21] highcard2: and i think a big factor is total stream hours, most streamers with followings like that stream a fuckload of hours
[5:04:27] KUDVIN_DI: I belive its define by whom is the food coocked and what is the kitchen
[5:04:30] GimlisNo1Axe: pure gameplay is why I’m here rn
[5:04:32] Hoshma46: the most parasocial audiences are vtuber enjoyers
[5:04:34] highcard2: more time watching = more attachment from viewers maybe
[5:04:37] lolFluke: I'm delulu for lulu Hamilton
[5:04:38] nationas: oh god
[5:04:40] greatangelsanguinius: I’m going non verbal
[5:04:40] OG_Kawngi: lonely dudes getting lost out there
[5:04:41] Brotholomew13: idk max there are def a lot of people that will just 1 for 1 parrot what you say
[5:04:44] Slapsstick: amouranth Pog
[5:04:45] splashz0r: If james has a million fans, then I am one of them. If jame has ten fans, then I am one of them. If james has only one fan then that is me. If james has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against james, then I am against the world.
[5:04:51] Standy94: Rogue streamers. Rogue is so cool
[5:04:51] Vordie: oh god not vtubers
[5:04:56] ca_Y_z: germans in particular strive collectivly. stand out have it harder here
[5:04:59] iiamBaro: Sinatraa fans are crazy too if u know anything about valorant
[5:05:01] ca_Y_z: *outs
[5:05:03] ciggyman: just Chatting
[5:05:06] nightst314: you will find some
[5:05:07] Vordie: The VTubers at the streamer awards..........
[5:05:14] kaphenge: @Hoshma46 not really, it depends on the kind of content they do, irl or vtuber
[5:05:15] Suited_Monkey: keep waffling until I finish my leggo quest
[5:05:15] Evalend_: its not waffling its content
[5:05:17] EMCQable: time to start pancaking
[5:05:17] fronkacean: lowkey think ppl that flame other ppl have a higher likelyhood of cultivating that sort of chat behaviour?
[5:05:27] lolFluke: tariq goes hard as fuck
[5:05:28] MemphisGamingTTV: I think it’s also what do people look up to you for. for gingi, peekaboo it’s primarily the skill they have in the game so they get out on a pedestal more. where as you are more personality driven. you’re a good player, but I think more people are here for your personality more than the gameplay
[5:05:28] fronkacean: its the like "haha we're better than them" with a viewer despite the viewer not being
[5:05:30] Slapsstick: @fronkacean i can see it
[5:05:37] nationas: @fronkacean yes
[5:05:38] droxfo: Destiny and Hasan fans
[5:05:52] Arvakr: ego
[5:05:56] caveman2x: the bad boy
[5:05:58] cajovysacok: i like  and  respect female streamers who doesnt use boobs to farm views
[5:06:07] ca_Y_z: i dont even know where i get this from. my brain just hits the observations in key sentances
[5:06:12] nightst314: overconfidence
[5:06:17] Onca4242: That's kinda the opposite with Faker... he's notoriously shockingly humble
[5:06:21] BobAwesome: The only other wow streamer I watch is Savix but he does classic stuff. He's very positive though. fun mood
[5:06:23] Ok_Kingston: @cajovysacok booba
[5:06:51] CptPinkeye: People that have weird takes on things, like Asmon... that is a weird following.
[5:06:55] JimmyBeardSlam: chat, anyone doing the outland cup? im having so much trouble with the auchindoun one
[5:07:06] djs42012: Hello Max, do you still do stuff with Bubbadub?
[5:07:08] zerofktgive: WOWGrandma
[5:07:09] fronkacean: ye guess it comes with realistically having a loud ego
[5:07:14] Troniin: man, keys this week are gross
[5:07:18] anmusallam: its a need for attention that causes that obsessive behavior
[5:07:21] Arvakr: hes like a full on celberity over there
[5:07:23] EFFSIN: james flamed nerf
[5:07:25] EFFSIN: Kappa
[5:07:26] santalylth: he flames his tank
[5:07:27] nationas: there is some weird fucking brain wiring happening on twitch
[5:07:28] awesomeoohh: wowgrandma literally the goat
[5:07:29] ylisse7: Messi and Ronaldo fans on twitter >.<
[5:07:29] CoffeeASAP: Pikaboo flames me :(
[5:07:30] Hoshma46: except nerf Kappa
[5:07:33] ciggyman: pikaboo insane energy
[5:07:36] caveman2x: i watch pika all the time and dont pvp at all
[5:07:40] cajovysacok: Pikabo is like machine
[5:07:40] highcard2: pika is generally positive
[5:07:43] Aephelian: Aephelian subscribed with Prime. 
[5:07:44] nightst314: PvP needs new content
[5:07:44] SpeedyMcD: @CptPinkeye Asmon makes a following off of crapping on wow. that just what he is known for and what his content is. doesnt matter how good the game is doing
[5:07:45] fronkacean: if pika came out in 2014 it would be over for everyone
[5:07:47] iiamBaro: if pikaboo doesnt play wow pvp he would be the biggest streamer ever lol
[5:07:48] Slapsstick: "THE MOVE BABY CRACK A CLAW"
[5:07:51] Vordie: And let's keep it that way.
[5:07:53] destrostoo: Crusader3455
[5:07:57] nick08_wow: if pikaboo got into m+ his commentary mid key would be insane
[5:07:57] ciggyman: hes a great streamer, he like reads literally every message out loud idk how his brain operates
[5:07:57] ca_Y_z: i guess individual and collective success is what its all about in the end
[5:08:00] Brohdin: Pika somehow has Adderall and stoner energy at the same time
[5:08:05] s_thetic_steve: pika def holds 80% of the pvp viewership lol
[5:08:06] ryanchungo: @Maximum can they nerf council, my guild is hard fcking bricked on it
[5:08:09] fronkacean: sadly pika was 12 years old back then
[5:08:18] KUDVIN_DI: Max, have you done the flying cups or whatever they called ?
[5:08:20] Standy94: he was 9
[5:08:22] KeyboardDeath: They need to copy a better PvP model
[5:08:24] ciggyman: pika was getting titles still KEKW
[5:08:26] GrimmshadoXI: Being able to jump onto an early bandwagon about a lesser known player / streamer that then grows makes people become fanatics of that person. I feel like that's a bit of what happened with JPC being discovered before joining Liquid, then being recruited
[5:08:26] ca_Y_z: the hybrid literally makes a company
[5:08:34] Hoshma46: @fronkacean and still better than most people at wow at that age KEKW
[5:08:36] Brotholomew13: old world dragonriding is so based
[5:08:38] nick08_wow: he enables them tho KEKW
[5:08:41] BobAwesome: Wasn't that Preach?
[5:08:43] nightst314: that's 10% of his content by now
[5:09:02] highcard2: half his takes arent genuine
[5:09:03] OG_Kawngi: he for sure fosters it
[5:09:03] Marz311: he loves wow and wants it to be a better game.
[5:09:05] nightst314: Preach was neutral/positive for a long time, probably too long.
[5:09:08] ca_Y_z: key diffrence is the burden right. it stems on two, or countless shoulders
[5:09:15] Hoshma46: he 100% attracts them
[5:09:15] CoffeeASAP: lol
[5:09:17] nationas: LUL
[5:09:19] OG_Kawngi: like a sheep herder
[5:09:20] Brohdin: He validates them in their eyes
[5:09:21] colboi: I like Hazelnutty
[5:09:23] UnheardGrace: asmon is a very different person than the average asmon fan. asmon actually has decent takes, but his chat is somethin else
[5:09:24] holee105: bellular is insuff
[5:09:28] colboi: shes wholesome
[5:09:37] sysfantasm: Never got bellular hate tbh
[5:09:38] CoffeeASAP: Hazel is a sweetheart
[5:09:39] ciggyman: asmon is cool, his chat is the demon
[5:09:40] nightst314: his sub-reddit will double/triple-post any doomer post each day
[5:09:42] BobAwesome: I have a friend who doesn't even play wow who watches Asmon and he tries to talk my friend and I who do play about wow stuff, which is weird.
[5:09:46] iCarDog: his stream is like daycare for doomers LUL
[5:09:56] robnrazz: @iCarDog KEKW
[5:10:04] Arvakr: LMAOOOOOOOOO
[5:10:06] OG_Kawngi: mom come pick me up
[5:10:14] caveman2x: Doomers Anonymous
[5:10:19] nightst314: let's get the buzzword-sermon out again!
[5:10:21] jvmes_r6: yooo lmao
[5:10:23] Starforkx: @robnrazz accurate lmaooo
[5:10:34] SMRyan: asmon just gives doomers more to chew on.
[5:10:45] Vordie: It's like a self fullfilling prophecy
[5:10:54] SpeedyMcD: @Maximum do you think they will revamp or work on alot of talent trees or will they be too focused on hero talents
[5:11:00] cajovysacok: i feels like some wow streamers become worse and less entertaining but people watch them because they are just use to
[5:11:02] colboi: max do you like WoWGrandmother?
[5:11:03] OG_Kawngi: reinforces the loop
[5:11:15] MarkusGrimes: asmon viewers consider him the end all be all expert on all things WoW and that to me is crazy.
[5:11:24] nightst314: lately you can post the most nonsense take video in his subreddit and he will just nod it off
[5:11:27] Vordie: There can be 99 people in a room
[5:11:29] Brohdin: Elevator experiment
[5:11:31] shockywow: @maximum is the cc prio weakaura available on wagio? If so what's it called? Sorry for veering off topic here
[5:11:32] ciggyman: BASED
[5:11:36] fronkacean: true Kappa
[5:11:37] zerofktgive: wowgrandma is so awesome
[5:11:45] nationas: his last wow vod is about the mythic completion stats and the title is bait af
[5:12:01] LuciFeariUm: @shockywow he put a text copy in his discord
[5:12:03] highcard2: this is gonna be one hell of a yt vid
[5:12:09] nightst314: his editors also do a lot of clickbait work for the audience
[5:12:10] Gryffin2009: @Maximum what's it like being the most attractive raid leader?
[5:12:10] ciggyman: i think asmon turns on his streams, plays the games he wants to play, and talks about what he wants to talk about
[5:12:23] Mezzedii: he keeps the doomers in a containment zone
[5:12:39] nationas: yes
[5:12:40] MrAndersen_: he has to deal with those takes endlessly in his chat too tho KEKW
[5:12:40] Mezzedii: he lets them roam free
[5:12:41] nationas: LUL
[5:12:41] Hoshma46: YEP
[5:12:44] nightst314: his latest take on raiderIO stats was just god awful though
[5:12:47] fronkacean: he sold his soul for 12 videos a day
[5:12:47] Starforkx: how dare he be popular
[5:12:53] aspiration89: he splits the profits with them
[5:12:59] branble: "IS RETAIL DEAD?"
[5:13:01] captainkirbal: His editors make the most clickbait degenerate shit.
[5:13:08] iCarDog: I don't think he really oversees what they post
[5:13:12] nationas: RETAIL KILLED A YOUNG CHILD
[5:13:13] enigmasvea: true
[5:13:13] Standy94: His YouTube is completely separate from him
[5:13:19] anmusallam: i only watch the xmog comps those are lit '
[5:13:19] iiamBaro: ASMON SAYTS RETAIL DEAD KEKW
[5:13:20] fronkacean: "Retail WoW.. is not doing well" with him facepalming uploaded 1 day ago btw
[5:13:20] honeychonker: @Maximum it was a bunch of leechers he let record his streams for free, then youtube started taking videos down so he had to hire them
[5:13:21] ciggyman: LMAO
[5:13:21] Alarius_: bro his videos are a virus on youtube, you watch one and your whole feed becomes asmon
[5:13:23] ciggyman: KEKW
[5:13:26] MemphisGamingTTV: it gets the viewsss
[5:13:33] goodsorc: kinda out of context but not out of context
[5:13:36] SMRyan: @nationas KEKW
[5:13:37] KUDVIN_DI: nah-nah-nah, the title would be "WOW FUCKING SUCKS ?!"
[5:13:39] jaegerlamb: 😈 wow is shit?
[5:13:43] sysfantasm: Around 9.1 we were stuck in a negative spiral which generated that retail WoW got a worse reputation than AIDS because of constant system criticism...
[5:13:45] shockywow: @lucifearium by his discord do you mean the team liquid discord? I'm on mobile so the twitch UI is a bit odd if it's in his profile
[5:13:48] enigmasvea: @fronkacean THIS KEKW
[5:13:49] nightst314: his editors are known classic zealots though
[5:13:50] captainkirbal: What sucks is that his editors used to be chill too, before they were hired workers
[5:14:13] CoffeeASAP: pgeGuilty
[5:14:13] caveman2x: legendary vid
[5:14:20] gunshinsora: his videos severely impact the community that way, like a lot - each time a big video hits the community seems to be filled with idiots
[5:14:22] highcard2: lmao a month later he was touring blizz hq
[5:14:28] Starforkx: his editors are kinda pog though at the same time, they definitely shit on asmon too often
[5:14:33] LuciFeariUm: @shockywow nah his actual discord. i think !discord works for it
[5:14:37] nightst314: when he came back the doom poster bombarded the comment section
[5:14:55] aspiration89: KEKW
[5:15:03] sysfantasm: "WOW IS DEAD" (WoW just got bought up by highest valued company on the planet)
[5:15:05] ciggyman: KEKW lil bitch
[5:15:06] logicaltty: im gonna clip that out of context
[5:15:07] eyxx: mental illness
[5:15:16] CoffeeASAP: he said in that video he'd come back if blizz changed directions lol
[5:15:16] Khorvan: I never click on Preach's videos because the titles/thumbnails are so dogshit, but whenever I do click on them for some reason I always really enjoy the videos
[5:15:17] OG_Kawngi: didn't Ion meme on that
[5:15:19] ca_Y_z: right
[5:15:19] nick08_wow: welcome to modern social media where everything posted is either bait and or faked just to attract views. Fucking sucks. twitter is garbage now cause of it
[5:15:29] shockywow: !discord
[5:15:29] StreamElements: https://discord.gg/EPHq4vUDuu or try !liquidcord
[5:15:31] ca_Y_z: healable, yet concerning
[5:15:32] Taege: People just skim read/view and take it as the full story
[5:15:36] ciggyman: nerf 1v1 ellsemere
[5:15:43] ciggyman: battle royal
[5:15:45] redcrimtane: Asmon gives his editors a 60% cut of his videos, they don't give a shit about any repurcussions, they're making bank, and are pumping it until/if the asmongold well runs dry
[5:15:47] destrostoo: I trust 0% of titles
[5:15:59] nationas: see title go to comment section and vent about how you hate x
[5:15:59] Hoshma46: youtube thumbnail meta DIESOFCRINGE
[5:16:02] Slapsstick: its that tik tok attention span LUL
[5:16:04] CoffeeASAP: @Maximum Chris from Preach's team also said they release their videos with a few different thumbnails then go with the one that gets the most clicks
[5:16:04] nationas: maybe watch vod
[5:16:04] splashz0r: max you should try out last epoch, it comes out next month (new arpg between poe and d4 in terms of complexity)
[5:16:05] gunshinsora: i am guilty of attributing clickbaits to the Person in this case aka Preach or Asmon cz they can have control over these titles in a way @Maximum
[5:16:18] goodsorc: dont most streamers sign off on everything thats being edited= max
[5:16:20] KUDVIN_DI: Max is talking about journalism in nutshell
[5:16:21] sysfantasm: Liquid should have a professional "counter-creator" working full-time with shutting down idiot narratives
[5:16:31] fronkacean: @CoffeeASAP ye this is super normal A/B testing, i do this with some of max's videos
[5:16:51] sysfantasm: A/B, clickbait is just the game man
[5:16:56] nick08_wow: front working the mines
[5:16:59] nick08_wow: a/b testing
[5:16:59] Booorrito: Get that fronk guy a raise
[5:17:01] nationas: you gotta step up and catch the doomer audience fronk
[5:17:01] aspiration89: KEKW  󠀀

[5:17:04] robnrazz: KEKW 󠀀
[5:17:04] Brohdin: KEKW
[5:17:05] splashz0r: 'sign off' KEKW
[5:17:08] fronkacean: sadly u didnt proc the insane new one where youtube does it automatically
[5:17:10] OG_Kawngi: xdding
[5:17:15] theDirtyon3: Aware
[5:17:23] Brotholomew13: lol max didn't know that the drama video was out
[5:17:28] OG_Kawngi: fronk gonna go rogue
[5:17:34] caveman2x: literally sat a streamer find out the other day there was a video on his page 6 months old about a meme in his chat lol
[5:17:34] try_weii: but do these nuts fall on you?
[5:17:38] ciggyman: fronk puttin u in the dirt
[5:17:39] LuciFeariUm: throwback to when max was just saying he wasnt sure if he liked that fronk made a video about the drama
[5:17:44] Starforkx: @fronkacean his YT life is in your hands
[5:17:45] luzcius: maximumFEAR
[5:17:45] caveman2x: saw*
[5:17:46] domz_i: Madseason shit on blizzard and then came right back
[5:17:50] niwow: you're either coaching it or allowing it to happen
[5:18:08] nationas: drama had a good disclaimer
[5:18:16] theDirtyon3: EZ 75 k views now
[5:18:30] fronkacean: ye i was considering sending it on clips channel, but it was handled very reasonably - but in the future we'll just cut back on actually uploading them
[5:18:34] CoffeeASAP: you approached it more about looking under the hood of the situation rather than just exploiting the drama
[5:18:37] menzlo: keemstar of wow
[5:18:42] Brotholomew13: it was a pretty decent video
[5:18:42] ncg20: Max about to become the DramaAlert of WoW
[5:18:54] Zilesky: Yo got a df code ?
[5:18:56] try_weii: banal
[5:18:56] sysfantasm: Do you think that a metric ton of WoW drama content or critical content is better than no content/coverage at all?
[5:18:57] LuciFeariUm: im just using it as an example of how videos arent exactly screened by the streamer before uploading
[5:19:02] try_weii: poshlust
[5:19:09] stumie: the drama about pokimanes cookies was maybe the dumbest thing on the internet in a while
[5:19:33] InfamousMaverick: InfamousMaverick subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[5:19:44] LuciFeariUm: very fair very fair
[5:20:09] sysfantasm: Toxicmaxxing
[5:20:19] Alarius_: just depends how much you care about your image
[5:20:26] KUDVIN_DI: asmon is just making gold
[5:20:26] ahnn112: hello

[5:20:36] menzlo: she was memeing
[5:20:44] Brohdin: Just don't buy them OMEGALUL
[5:20:46] acadiian: is there a bit of "if I don't do it someone else will" mentality with click bait content
[5:20:46] shockywow: @lucifearium thank you I think I found it, most recent message in the general channel. Sadly not home to input it to make sure
[5:20:48] fronkacean: @menzlo fuel is fuel sadly, ppl dont care about context etc
[5:20:55] captainkirbal: The best part was the cookies were not good lol
[5:20:58] aspiration89: @Brohdin Exactly. Don't like the price? Don't buy it LUL
[5:21:04] Korentice: im not mad, cause i AM broke

[5:21:20] juliwestside: I love my Swipe
[5:21:21] sysfantasm: Consuming drama is just a losing game, waste of time. All such junk is forgotten within months.

[5:29:29] Brohdin: @Icydeadppl23 If you're a component cook it's not the most cost effective but if you replace your takeout with it it's a good product

[5:29:38] Foodtime: I'm lucky my wife enjoys cooking
[5:29:40] LuciFeariUm: Baseg

[5:31:11] aspiration89: It's not bad for the first few boxes at least
[5:31:18] awesomeoohh: Groceries are mad expensive now it's not bad

[5:31:29] Burninsummers: can i get a mil g i got you lmao
[5:31:36] nick08_wow: you still can
[5:31:41] Brohdin: For what it is yes, it get's dunked if you buy raw ingredients and are a component cook, it's a good replacement for doordash like he said
[5:31:46] aspiration89: YEP
[5:31:48] CoffeeASAP: the pricing is comparable to eating out, but the food is better
[5:32:06] goombacci: yes because of economies of scale
[5:32:09] aspiration89: Salads are more expensive than cheeseburgers
[5:32:11] Brohdin: I think it's similar in Japan
[5:32:12] menzlo: or there's just not a grocery store close enough
[5:32:13] VRVento: its not cheaper for sure
[5:32:13] doublebogey: @Maximum the hack is getting an air fryer and chicken and a box of salad from aldi
[5:32:16] MrAxeffect: its not cheaper but people are told its cheaper and then they do it
[5:32:18] highcard2: grocery prices went wild the last couple years

[5:32:24] menzlo: yeah it's time
[5:32:24] wickywow: Not cheaper in most EU countries to eat at MCd
[5:32:24] nick08_wow: it's more nuanced than that
[5:32:28] vexarious: Are you kidding me? 4 years ago you could get the same groceries you would buy now for half the price.
[5:32:29] wow_noboat: I am those people. because shopping, cooking, doing dishes aint worth the time and energy
[5:32:30] N3llee: i dont know man its $7 bucks for a coffee and egg mcmuffin now

[5:32:55] fronkacean: not luxury at all but the foods not considered trashy
[5:32:55] AkuTVgg: McDonalds in Japan is the business
[5:32:58] OG_Kawngi: the death of the dollar menu was great for me, haven't had it in years
[5:33:02] gunshinsora: @sysfantasm wouldn't it be US?
[5:33:03] fronkacean: its also considered one of the best workplaces here
[5:33:05] CoffeeASAP: that's probably because they have laws that make them serve actual food lol
[5:33:13] HakiThunderFox: I have to pay 10€ for a burger at mc donalds. I could buy ingredients to make 3-4 burgers instead
[5:33:14] goombacci: @carmlost I'm on my third reincarnation at the moment

[5:33:40] fronkacean: ye maccas is forced to be nicer or ppl wouldnt go
[5:33:46] Situationall: Nah. Cooking at home is still substantially cheaper. I can grill up some chicken, steam some veggies and rice and feed my family for sub $10. Can't do that even at mcdonalds.
[5:33:55] doublebogey: mcdonalds with the app deal is unironically cheap
[5:34:01] feeras_gg: i love the good old CBO its so good
[5:34:03] nationas: mcdonalds caters to the culture of where they are
[5:34:04] SpeedyMcD: @Maximum do you think we'll see rework to talent trees or are they too focused on hero talents
[5:34:05] fronkacean: mcdonalds is a HOF "hit the spot" type meal
[5:34:10] IPlay_Gaming_: get your mcdouble made like a mac. ggez
[5:34:12] santalylth: just started working at chipotle
[5:34:12] carmlost: McDonald’s is goated with the sauce quite literally
