[0:02:14] Kellvig: @limburgse Ellow m8 HeyGuys
[0:02:23] jbeemerks: it is definitely an accomplishment though
[0:02:25] 13brill: Is this the day the Blood God will be defied and his own blood spilled?
[0:02:31] Logic0311: @jbeemerks yes it's same old HC. but it's relaxing
[0:02:38] mudkip4me: EU is trying to kill hon today
[0:02:39] limburgse: are we ready for some mayhem today? PogChamp üçø
[0:02:45] Logic0311: maybe relaxing is not the best word for HARDCORE
[0:02:49] kirk_hunts: I want to do Self Found but my problem is I can't do that and this. If I'm playing self found I'm going off the deepend and pretty much method acting that character to 60
[0:03:10] Logic0311: @kirk_hunts I think I'm off SoD until P3
[0:03:11] TheEndIsNear777: #IwantSelfLost

[0:04:43] Oogiman: they buffed his hp
[0:04:46] limburgse: lets crash the server again üèÜ
[0:04:47] kirk_hunts: @Logic0311 that being said I'm not a fan at all of 1v1 dueling or battlegrounds. The STV event being as fun as it is is carrying hard.
[0:04:50] SmugJerry: @CuppaCoffeh so confirmed mechanic and not Blizz trolling
[0:04:50] NvSuros: @Kfclol2912 you have to have blood coins for it niot  to heal
[0:05:00] kirk_hunts: 1v1 dueling or battlegrounds this phase***
[0:05:07] kirk_hunts: I usually love those two things
[0:05:20] mudkip4me: They are gonna try again in 40 minutes
[0:05:22] kirk_hunts: I was addicted to mage FC in P1
[0:05:29] booddhi: what did you find out today?
[0:05:46] Oogiman: @Xaryu today the bosses base health seems to be buffed to over 30million
[0:06:09] limburgse: gonna run some groceries real quick, what time is it at Xaryu‚Äôs place ( for bloodmoon event )
[0:06:11] SmugJerry: @Oogiman no shot, fr?
[0:06:23] Genghish: Its joever
[0:06:28] jbeemerks: xar is gmt
[0:06:33] Logic0311: @kirk_hunts it has been fun imo
[0:06:36] Oogiman: @SmugJerry yea says 32,000,000 on my screen
[0:06:47] Oogiman: and change
[0:07:00] booddhi: so theres a mechanic that changes it
[0:07:05] Oogiman: no
[0:07:06] hearingblockchain: KILL KHA'DAMU
[0:07:07] Oogiman: his base HP
[0:07:09] Oogiman: is now higher

[0:07:20] booddhi: but it changes?
[0:07:28] Almighty_kenzo: Based on
[0:07:30] Oogiman: at 20%
[0:07:38] ddevillax: maybe hes only meant to be killed at lvl 60
[0:07:56] NvSuros: maybe
[0:07:56] kirk_hunts: @Logic0311 I'm having fun in everything but AB. 1v1 is people wont Bo3 you they will only duel you with CDs or there's someone at their front door
[0:08:11] kirk_hunts: Not xaryu obviosuly
[0:08:11] nfernal_majesty: YOOO SUP BRO
[0:08:12] mudkip4me: the boss's hp starts at the 32m or at 20% changes to that 32m like yesterday?
[0:08:15] booddhi: imagine they killed it last night when it wasnt supposed to be killed
[0:08:28] iFreeze420: @ddevillax it is with that attitude
[0:08:32] kirk_hunts: but the vast majority of players are just bad and trying to hit their trick shots and not learn anything lol
[0:08:46] kirk_hunts: that I've encountered in 1v1
[0:09:07] iFreeze420: @mudkip4me it didnt change to 32m yesterday
[0:09:17] iFreeze420: it changed to 13m / 67m
[0:09:27] iFreeze420: from 3.2m base
[0:09:42] stumpiftw: I dced off of the layer yesterday :(
[0:09:43] kirk_hunts: It's mind blowing how effective a pseudo interupt is and players inability to reaquire a target that hasn't moved lol
[0:09:46] querke87: How long intill the raid starta?
[0:09:48] limburgse: boss still has 3.2mil hp at start, they didnt changed it
[0:09:58] hearingblockchain: Does the boss still have 3.2m base today?
[0:10:00] iFreeze420: good
[0:10:02] querke87: starts‚Äô
[0:10:23] jbarish: multiple other attempts have been made always goes to 14 million when brought to 20% hp
[0:10:30] jbarish: Guzu did it this morning same thing happened
[0:10:35] limburgse: but it increases at 20% as we know
[0:10:36] lyleneththedruid: Wait is there another RWF?
[0:10:50] stumpiftw: so we need to get enough people to do 14 mil hp
[0:10:54] impa1nful: what time does sf drop
[0:11:02] mudkip4me: There is a mechanic you have to deal with to get the hp to drop
[0:11:05] primatemelissa: What are we doing today boiz?!
[0:11:09] kirk_hunts: We kind of created a new RWF yesterday on accident
[0:11:19] lyleneththedruid: @kirk_hunts ooh do share.
[0:11:21] limburgse: 3pm PST is SFlaunch
[0:11:33] Oogiman: nobody cares about ssf

[0:12:35] primatemelissa: Zuid-Holland represent
[0:12:36] kirk_hunts: Xar wanted to kill the blood god yesterday so naturally we all just did it with like probably a combine 700+ if you include horde and alliance
[0:12:39] Kellvig: @Xaryu Sup Josh, how we feelin?
[0:12:46] alleandra1612: Hier ook Zuid-Holland
[0:13:02] thebigdongerhere: 12min its time
[0:13:04] kirk_hunts: and then after our second attempt got it to like 16 or 18% something like that
[0:13:14] thebigdongerhere: Little abuse ofc?
[0:13:18] kirk_hunts: LAter throught the evenning other streamers took their swings at it
[0:13:21] limburgse: EU tries again in 20min
[0:13:30] Reaperz_kinetic: @kirk_hunts as far as I know nobody‚Äôs done it right?
[0:13:44] limburgse: nobody killed the boss yet
[0:13:44] kirk_hunts: we will know when it happens
[0:13:56] kirk_hunts: it's either someone broke the game
[0:14:02] kirk_hunts: or someone beat P2
[0:14:03] Dogelson: ppc
[0:14:15] Reaperz_kinetic: I mean the boss is clearly meant to die one way or another
[0:14:18] CuppaCoffeh: I think it needs to be horde and alliance attacking him
[0:14:22] limburgse: the last 20% is harsh and there should be a trick for it to make it easier, but no one knows what the trick is
[0:14:22] kirk_hunts: that will spread like wildfire
[0:14:41] primatemelissa: Has anyone finished the troll boss yet?
[0:14:49] thebigdongerhere: Eu has
[0:14:50] 13brill: EU doesnt mess around, my server is mobilizing aswell

[0:15:06] adora_the_explora: bro is missing the battle right now xD
[0:15:06] limburgse: EU didnt killed it, stop trolling

[0:15:17] Reaperz_kinetic: @thebigdongerhere EU not that good
[0:15:21] ddevillax: no one killed it yet
[0:15:23] kirk_hunts: if it's doable anmd someone else gets it I want a printout of every mage that cast arcane explosion and living bomb at the afternoon Blood Moon Event and I am dedicating the rest of this phase to their anihilation.
[0:15:25] meguidokun: lol no one has, go bs soewhere else

[0:20:46] Mambalo: ST would be cool
[0:20:48] kirk_hunts: and ST can fit 20 people
[0:21:07] DuckTwelve: imagine if they put something in that referenced the guzu hole üòÇüòÇüòÇ @xaryu
[0:21:07] blowoutsale: goozu
[0:21:12] espi: HUH
[0:21:14] stuffe92: hahah
[0:21:19] AceOfFlame: 10 man has become to problematic with dps
[0:21:20] pizac7: 20 so that guilds can start preparing to make 20 man rosters for 60 phases
[0:21:25] cosmin284: fuegoHi everyone good evening happy Tuesday fuegoL fuegoH

[0:22:02] ogkoop: I'm getting in on this boss kill
[0:22:09] Ervill1: the way Blizzard intended for the Bloodlord to be killed is for him to be kited to the Stockades and killed by the fly hacking mages TheIlluminati
[0:22:10] 13brill: Guzu hole boss will drop a slowfall trinket for sure

[0:22:20] dickwormjim: there is a video of them getting it to 13%
[0:22:22] thebigdongerhere: Xaryu u need to stab him from the back
[0:22:40] Ganskarandoms: @taylorsdank It says dont fal under one of the pictures on the site. Maby a lil reference
[0:22:41] A1K_GAMING: i think u need to minimize the amount of kills boss gets in phase 1
[0:22:42] surgento: COPIUM
[0:22:46] blowoutsale: COPIUM
[0:22:47] ogkoop: Didn't blizz say there was a ddos attack
[0:22:49] clickityclacker: hunters
[0:22:54] bamfshot: average amount of ppl yesterday after you got off no lag got him down to 5%
[0:22:55] lurker_0o: Guzu's grp wasn't lagging he said
[0:22:57] JuliusShark: servers crashed last night as well
[0:22:58] m0ffz: do the same thing as yesterday and see if it was actually ddos or not
[0:23:01] soggiwaffleguy: The servers haven't been stable in weeks for STV event
[0:23:01] jbeemerks: for sure.
[0:23:06] Prettyneat: What do you get for killing the boss?
[0:23:09] Craigumander: dont we need ppl to straight up die to him tho?

[0:23:22] Slyratt: I wonder if blizz puts an end to this today. it makes the whole server unplayable
[0:23:23] ogkoop: Nah u guys had it to 9%
[0:23:23] DoMzTa_: when does SF open up?
[0:23:24] Jpublico4: it seemed stable as Guzu did a try on eu this morning
[0:23:25] Unfragged: boss drops linen cloth lol
[0:23:26] Domatonetv: did you work out if he is getting buffed by kills at 20%
[0:23:27] hollywoodxJ: Guzu did it earlier and servers wernt lagging only got him to 15-20%
[0:23:27] lurker_0o: All those mages were killing everyone
[0:23:30] joestopfarmingshako: What even happened to stv lag man it was fine till they moved gnomer to 3 day lockout
[0:23:31] beachwave_: gotta wear the gnomer shades
[0:23:33] A_Rodimus: Discord call
[0:23:48] BKDDY: bkddyMadgeRightNow

[0:24:06] Valeeraw_: Hi Xaryu valeer8GreyWait valeer8Greyloaf valeer8Greyloaf
[0:24:08] flave261091: maybe do it on different layers how it is suposed to be and do more dps with no lag
[0:24:11] krupp825: I'm in CA and its only 8:40AM PST. Arizona being weird not using Daylight Savings.
[0:24:13] bumlefar: Hey Xaryu. How do one justify big streamers haveing a big voice against GKDPs but then accepting gold in trades ingame
[0:24:14] Cythra: how long till stv
[0:24:15] omnipresentbe1ng: when are u gonna kill stv boss :) ?
[0:24:16] ddevillax: talk to shobek about the phase 2 mechanic
[0:24:19] haversham29: Lol Xar was just trolling using living bomb
[0:24:20] Prevara96: imagine boss drops 35 anima KEKW
[0:24:22] jbeemerks: do you think the gm was there so the boss didn‚Äôt reset?
[0:24:23] packtar: I believe that best option would be to minimize the deaths in the 100 to 20% phase, a few tanks and multi people spamming heals on the tanks.  This should reduce the hp he receives at 20% then go ham at the end
[0:24:23] UnsafeCell: at least create the character!
[0:24:27] chrisrev: its when he hits max ears
[0:24:29] ironmouse34: wait until Tuesday to start leveling ... .100% exp buff on all realms

[0:24:40] fredzky: Hey Guuy's what time its starts today?
[0:24:42] limburgse: there must be a mech, but we need to figure out what it is
[0:24:45] krupp825: @Breakfist_ Not yet, apparently.
[0:24:48] oopoop1134: phase 2 gains health per ears he‚Äôs taken?
[0:24:49] limburgse: you guys tried that yesterday
[0:24:49] Almighty_kenzo: I‚Äôm not level 40 yet in SoD so ima just play that tbh
[0:24:49] uBm3D: there is only one question: has shobek got his mooount already ?
[0:24:51] ColbaeTV: why do you think the GM dragged the boss to the altar?
[0:24:52] hollywoodxJ: I think we need to find HOW TO DROP bruised debuff
[0:24:53] mundanesickle: Doesn't work, was tried yesterday
[0:24:53] Rocksteady22: blood weapons
[0:24:55] A1K_GAMING: yep
[0:24:55] 13brill: brute force it!
[0:24:57] fredzky: Okqy bro
[0:24:58] oldbananachips: Maybe he just got to many kills or ears? and then went super sayan
[0:25:02] surchristoph: Predictions
[0:25:03] meguidokun: i still think the GM did something weird last attempt
[0:25:04] Oogiman: get MAX IN HERE AND ASK HIM @Xaryu
[0:25:08] Kellvig: @Xaryu Hey Josh, I was wondering what your plans for Solo Self Found is: race, server class etc :D
[0:25:10] Alacor: what is the phase 2? didn't get a chance to see your other attempts @Xaryu
[0:25:15] mundanesickle: Turning in blood does not work, was tried yesterday
[0:25:17] dickwormjim: you need bloods apparently, and groups of 5 so you don‚Äôt share the stacks (someone said)
[0:25:17] jbeemerks: sacrifice players at his feet @20%
[0:25:18] joestopfarmingshako: Why would participating in the event kill the blood God, he probably just gains max health
[0:25:20] Kazunya_Meowryu: here xar https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/24056987/wow-hardcore-self-found-mode-begins-february-29 @Xaryu
[0:25:23] demololtv: boss dies today?
[0:25:25] bamfosaurus: GM was trying to kite boss to altar right?
[0:25:30] Stomachfakie: I still think Xaryu did something weird last attempt
[0:25:34] demololtv: TLDR on how u got it to 13% please @Xaryu
[0:25:36] TurtleHoptv: if theres a mechanic and you try to brute for him.. he might get stuck at 1hp lol
[0:25:39] Synthez542: Guzus EU boss had less health than US one
[0:25:50] jbeemerks: GM was keeping boss from resetting due to lag/ddos
[0:25:55] bottis96: BOSS gets blood stacks as well. any way to make him lose blood stacks get de buff
[0:25:55] graziNNN: @demololtv damaged it
[0:25:59] hollywoodxJ: Bruised debuff definitely has something to do with Phase 2
[0:25:59] Ganskarandoms: @Xaryu check discord #general chatt.
[0:26:00] ogkoop: We need to have the first kill on NA

[0:26:05] bumlefar: Hey Xaryu. How do one justify big streamers haveing a voice against GKDPs but then accepting gold in trades ingame
[0:26:06] hollywoodxJ: gotta figure out how to drop that debuff
[0:26:06] Playonwordz: shobek said the boss health pool went up he just checked @Xaryu
[0:26:07] Ophelly: usually you make offers to gods and the whole event is about turning blood to the blood loa... maybe the actually strat is to not turn in any blood since it would make sense that it buffs him
[0:26:09] DeathToad007: your an hour later than the west coast?
[0:26:26] bandage2: @Xaryu  what if try  anyone who is not doing boss to not play wow so wow dont crash
[0:26:30] graziNNN: DLS soon :(
[0:26:30] dariusbellpep: Kappa
[0:26:30] kirk_hunts: WE would have killed the boss with our group which was way better than any other attempt I saw. If the mages can just go ahead and take arcane explosion and living bomb off their bars and stop being buttheads then we would have killed this no problem yesterday
[0:26:31] curedubs: WE TAKE BOSS TO YOJAMBA ISLAND, THE ELITES THERE MIGHT HELP

[0:27:00] Oogiman: @Xaryu get liquid maximum to help, hes the best raid leader in the world first retail races maybe he can brainstorm lol
[0:27:01] inhaledthc: Maybe blizzard never wanted the boss to die
[0:27:09] daschadwick: Hey xaryu thats the temple of atal hakkar
[0:27:11] Kazunya_Meowryu: Any idea what you might start with on SSF?
[0:27:11] drreww: i honestly dont know....what's the explanation as to why no one knows the fight mechanics? never been beaten?
[0:27:14] ddevillax: maybe the boss was only meant to die at p4
[0:27:16] kirk_hunts: get mages to stop griefing event and we kill this boss
[0:27:23] MatiRey88: @inhaledthc make no sense, so maybe is true, speaking of blizzard
[0:27:25] bandage2: @Xaryu  what if try  anyone who is not doing boss to not play wow so wow dont crash
[0:27:26] curedubs: interesting, could go confirm if we dont down this attempt Okayge
[0:27:30] Tee__Gee_: max would clear
[0:27:32] Stoneyshe: do you think horde and alliance have to come together to kill it?
[0:27:32] hollywoodxJ: Need to explore STV to find out where to DROP the BRUISED DEBUFF
[0:27:38] LexaproNLattes: @Oogiman LOL doing backflips on it
[0:27:39] stormlightcookie: get gingi
[0:27:39] packtar: I believe that best option would be to minimize the deaths in the 100 to 20% phase, a few tanks and multi people spamming heals on the tanks. This should reduce the hp he receives at 20% then go ham at the end

[0:27:52] Almighty_kenzo: lmk what time you gonna do it so I can log out lol
[0:27:52] Ophelly: usually you make offers to gods and the whole event is about turning blood to the blood loa... maybe the actually strat is to not turn in any blood since it would make sense that it buffs him
[0:27:53] edmnd69: anyone unable to log in?
[0:27:54] graziNNN: If you get aggro on the boss, kite away as much as possible to delay how many kills he gets?
[0:27:56] monoboxtv: Do Booty Bay Bruisers kill it?
[0:28:01] lyleneththedruid: 3 runecloth 99%
[0:28:03] bojack359: Sup xaryu
[0:28:04] lyleneththedruid: i bet 100 su bs
[0:28:05] Taxsvcs: Was he still healing when he hit 20%?
[0:28:05] Kazunya_Meowryu: ahmpy would be BIS for figuring it out i bet! @Xaryu
[0:28:05] Genghish: There is no mechanic his HP just got buffed midfight

[0:28:41] Playonwordz: @Xaryu shobek said the boss's health pool went up, he just checked

[0:29:12] bushthebug: P2 is twitch prime phase it's the only thing that makes sense

[0:29:29] Eggzactly54: lol
[0:29:29] sexylegs9: @Xaryu It could be the amount of ears that the Loa has when it hits 20%. The lower amount of ears the less HP it gains?
[0:29:30] UnsafeCell: why 4 pm? Don't they know you are the biggest SSF supporter?
[0:29:32] kiffa49: EU tried to kill , it‚Äôs not killable.

[0:31:55] Erwincrates: what did hozito say to make good Xar ban him
[0:31:56] FrostsWorld: was the health increase at 20% consistent between yours and guzus attempt? @Xaryu
[0:31:58] chrondor: good morning folks
[0:32:01] heyimtazz: I think we need to poison our blood somehow to hurt him when he leaches... maybe the new alchemy potion  Û†ÄÄ
[0:32:03] Busst0pper: @Xaryu you have to have max bloodcoins buff to do dmg to zero life on Boss
[0:32:06] primatemelissa: Maybe horde and alliance need to work together instead of spilling eachothers blood?
[0:32:06] DatGuyAnton: Anybody know what happened to Jokerd?

[0:32:10] Almighty_kenzo: Hozito a hoe mane

[0:32:11] Holy_chit187: let‚Äôs go
[0:32:11] Odezq: @Xaryu it has to do something with his ear cap at 225

[0:32:15] bchamp93: DRAG HIM TO STORMWIND
[0:32:16] flo_406: @Xaryu do you think having more blood going into 20% will make him get less hp?
[0:32:17] shiggydoo43: PepeWhy
[0:32:17] Kryptiiq: the
[0:32:18] fknah: maybe killing the blood moon boss just unlocks that hidden vender in the cave out in the mountains of stv
[0:32:18] HelluvaWrecks: get his health to 0
[0:32:18] CyonDru: oh does it end in 2 hrs? @Xaryu
[0:32:19] shiggydoo43: too much pressure
[0:32:20] swyftboi: New strat: Pew pew harder
[0:32:21] limburgse: just bring his HP to 0%
[0:32:21] Eggzactly54: have you tried taking all his health away till he dies? @Xaryu
[0:32:21] hardwar31: just smoke meth on stream
[0:32:23] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu  you cant make a character because you have to toggle SSF in character creator menu right? Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[0:32:26] ogkoop: Switch alters at 20%
[0:32:27] patch___________: can u even attack it?
[0:32:28] YzieGG: maybe only 254 can die max
[0:32:29] Odezq: @Xaryu it has to be something with his ear cap 225
[0:32:30] MightyCactus1: Arent the blood turn ins offerings to the blood god tho? So wouldnt they help the boss in a sense??
[0:32:31] shadowvypers: i think boss had 20mil health this morning
[0:32:31] t1isokatleague: prioritize heals
[0:32:32] kingcherryholme: will there be drops ?
[0:32:33] joestopfarmingshako: Bring teremis to him
[0:32:34] avo_9: 20% take him near an altar and enough people need to /pray at the altar
[0:32:36] DuckjarTv: Turn in blood DOES NOT do more DMG. I tried it!
[0:32:36] bojack359: Lol was just about to say that
[0:32:37] ddevillax: THERES SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE BRUISED DEBUFF MAYBE?? BOOTY BAY BRUISERS?? POGGERS???
[0:32:39] Seoken1: it may have to be tried though unfortunately, gotta rule out all options @Xaryu
[0:32:40] Holy_chit187: attack each other at 20%
[0:32:41] taylorsdank: horde and ally have to come together and not kill each other
[0:32:41] McNerdSauce: ear cap 255, blood cap 255.....
[0:32:41] iPlayCuzFun: look my last messages
[0:32:42] beccaria21: What does Self Found means?
[0:32:42] kirk_hunts: What if the blood god stubbed his toe and that's why he's so angry and if we all hit him with mageweave bandages at the same time so he feels better and gives us mount.
[0:32:42] Unfragged: why dont you try it on the PTR first?
[0:32:44] ImSo1337: "When in doubt, Flat out" - Colin McCrae
[0:32:45] SpaceCowboy0811: his ears cap almost instantly...
[0:32:46] Craigumander: Or you just have a bunch of bloods from murking and each person he kills with bloods either does more dam or reduc healing?
[0:32:46] Odezq: @Xaryu has to be something with the ear cap 225
[0:32:46] Erwincrates: i think you should just kill it
[0:32:49] Meanpandah: best strat is get bosses health to zero before 30min timer
[0:32:49] Kazunya_Meowryu: ah makes sense
[0:32:51] hollywoodxJ: look for more stone tablets in STV to give hints
[0:32:52] ddevillax: THERES SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE BRUISED DEBUFF MAYBE?? BOOTY BAY BRUISERS?? POGGERS??? XARYU
[0:32:53] Seithr9: @Xaryu we tried the turn in at 20% at the 6pm event, didn't work
[0:32:53] Almighty_kenzo: Try that island idea to bring him there
[0:32:55] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: We might need him.....
[0:32:56] bamfshot: i think if you dont have the crazy lag yall had yesterday you'll be fine
[0:32:58] Rosster19er: maybe just try that as a last ditch effort if you can't burn him down after 20%
[0:32:58] Taxsvcs: Do any of the vods show him healing after 20%?
[0:32:58] daschadwick: try it without payo
[0:32:59] CyonDru: is there a limited time for the boss?
[0:32:59] xChiip95: is ssf on a fresh server?
[0:32:59] monoboxtv: Can any character survive a hit from that guy? What's the hit damage?
[0:32:59] maximo469: something happens when he heals to full 67M?
[0:33:00] KaryauGaming: some people were thinking that it depends on how many ear stacks he has will depend on how much health he gets
[0:33:01] ralphh1541: maybe he takes increased damage at altars when he hits 20%?
[0:33:02] heyimtazz: I think we need to poison our blood somehow to hurt him when he leaches... maybe the new alchemy potion
[0:33:03] KaryauGaming: so maybe kiting
[0:33:03] theyungdad: do you know about the caster jump spot at the stv arena? might be a good strat to cheese the boss @Xaryu Û†ÄÄ
[0:33:04] Mattias848: Hey mate
[0:33:05] tjaea: Can you drag him outside STV? Drag him towards SW? :D
[0:33:06] ShottaSoco: I LOVE U XAR
[0:33:06] packtar: I believe that best option would be to minimize the deaths in the 100 to 20% phase, a few tanks and multi people spamming heals on the tanks. This should reduce the hp he receives at 20% then go ham at the end
[0:33:06] Osi7z: having blood will scale your dmg in phase 2
[0:33:07] foraReggy: Take him to every alter?
[0:33:08] chrondor: @xaryu kite him to GM island
[0:33:09] primatemelissa: Full undead team xarOMEGALUL
[0:33:10] Valeeraw_: @xaryu Horde or Alliance for SFA ?
[0:33:10] ikkiweber: 255 count is a tech limitation, not a mechanic
[0:33:10] wahedje: what if u can only kill the boss below 20% by using the epic weapons from the event?
[0:33:11] Domatonetv: he heals cause you are in raid groups.
[0:33:12] inspect4: the boss does attack close mobs teramus might work lol
[0:33:14] limburgse: @odezq the icon shows 255, when you mouseover it has wayway more ears
[0:33:14] BoyeTV: get a tank to tank him while dps does damage, also have a few healers to heal tank and dps
[0:33:15] mageguy8: elisBall maybe ears increase his health gain at the end
[0:33:15] Bojanglez: 0 ears 0 HP increase?
[0:33:16] iPlayCuzFun: maybe its a LAST STAND that refreshes on his KILLS
[0:33:16] gnated: no way
[0:33:17] mundanesickle: Staysafe tried the blood turnin at 20% last night and there was no change
[0:33:17] kingcherryholme: will there be drops ? Û†ÄÄ
[0:33:17] ogkoop: What does he say in demonic
[0:33:18] Eggzactly54: reduce his health to 0 while yours stays above zero
[0:33:19] Domatonetv: need lots of 5 man‚Äôs
[0:33:19] meguidokun: maybe its wht u whre saying, he gets healed depending on the amount of kills he got
[0:33:21] Mattias848: good evening ;)
[0:33:21] auroris9: Maybe you need some plague debuff for him to suck up
[0:33:21] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Speaking of Hozito look at the reaction/laugh when Hozito won the duel tournament last night :D https://clips.twitch.tv/BashfulSingleCurryWow-1tYs3IpN7lphjlYs
[0:33:22] drewskii318: what‚Äôs the diff between solo self found and just self found
[0:33:23] flo_406: @Xaryu do you think having more blood going into 20% will make him get less hp
[0:33:24] Holy_chit187: morning
[0:33:24] Kazunya_Meowryu: Could we have a poll on your first SSF character? :D
[0:33:26] gnated: no
[0:33:26] zen0vae: dont invite hunters and win
[0:33:27] WildeThornberry: i think ears matter
[0:33:27] BryanC614: thats such horrible boss design
[0:33:28] Almighty_kenzo: @domatonetv they were in 5 man‚Äôs yesterday evening
[0:33:29] troutmaster23: did he get health buffed during stay safe‚Äôs attempt?
[0:33:30] enigmasvea: no
[0:33:31] foraReggy: Its blizzard
[0:33:32] I3Iackarrow: YES
[0:33:33] Domatonetv: no raid
[0:33:33] YzieGG: maybe only 254 can die max Û†ÄÄ
[0:33:33] tinkerspelled: He's draining you with a similar debuff to hakkar's drain life, is there a debuff you can get that will give you posined debuff so when he drains it doesn't help???
[0:33:34] StunningPaul: Think of it from Blizzard they wouldn't make you kite it for 30 min
[0:33:34] Odezq: @Xaryu i think he hits enrage timer once he reaches 255 max ears, after that u have limited time to kill or he enrages for that current event and u need to wait 3hours for next try
[0:33:37] curedubs: not that feasible yeah
[0:33:37] ShingaTV: ofc not^^ + killing
[0:33:40] Domatonetv: 5 five man‚Äôs
[0:33:42] BoyeTV: HERE IS THE STRAT TO KILL IT :get a tank to tank him while dps does damage, also have a few healers to heal tank and dps
[0:33:43] Bhimasena: The strat is writing down all the griefer name's and spread the macro among all the raid Kappa
[0:33:46] iPlayCuzFun: maybe its a LAST STAND that refreshes when he kills someone!
[0:33:48] 13brill: Its probably a mechanic that involves a 5 man group at max to pull off
[0:33:53] Almighty_kenzo: Bro go study the land quick.
[0:33:54] kirk_hunts: what if when the boss drops below 20% the guy in the cave spawns, you can't kill boss but you can now buy tiger while he's heald under 20%
[0:33:54] WildeThornberry: see if ears scale from first to second event
[0:33:54] Dead_Seeker: All get the debuff to not engate on PvP and Kills the PVE boss.
[0:33:55] zen0vae: break the game
[0:33:56] shadowvypers: i think you were on the right track just need no lag/dcs
[0:33:57] Seronem0: everyone bandage before 20% -> no blood
[0:33:58] bryn_dee: It has to be incredibly simple and we are all over thinking it.. It has to be able to be completed with out a massive coordination/pulling hundreds and hundreds of people onto one layer..
[0:33:59] BadGerbilLion: @Xaryu the stealthed 70 elites in STV
[0:34:00] A_Rodimus: I think he has to not kill as many people and that's why the GM was invuln tanking for a while
[0:34:00] ddevillax: it must have something to do with bruised debuff
[0:34:02] Himaru7: just dps race its classic for blizz
[0:34:02] Odezq: @Xaryu he hits enrage timer once he reaches 255 max ears, after that u have limited time to kill or he enrages for that current event and u need to wait 3hours for next try
[0:34:02] Zownos: @Xaryu okay, I've always wondered about the White Weapons from SM.  May they are used to kill him at the alter.
[0:34:02] I3Iackarrow: KKW
[0:34:03] Odezq: @Xaryu he hits enrage timer once he reaches 255 max ears, after that u have limited time to kill or he enrages for that current event and u need to wait 3hours for next try - @Xaryu he hits enrage timer once he reaches 255 max ears, after that u have limited time to kill or he enrages for that current event and u need to wait 3hours for next try

[0:34:11] fartguyl: just kill him
[0:34:13] taylorsdank: i mean it is a good strat
[0:34:13] zen0vae: blizz would design an unkillable bugged boss for sure
[0:34:14] BoyeTV: :D :D
[0:34:14] Ganskarandoms: @Xaryu The SC of the dont fal is from WarcraftTavern site with the Tempel of hakkar raid. One of the 4 pictures if you scroll down.
[0:34:15] bamfshot: get 2 tanks in a grp with 3 healers
[0:34:16] dramajohns: take him to ZG island, there might be an interaction with the npcs there. they are supposed to be enemies.
[0:34:16] codename_ailes: or they just made him unkillable in p2 so you cant get rid of the buff during the event...lol
[0:34:16] asttroelite: 5HEAD

[0:34:25] Kfclol2912: @Xaryu you need 255 blood and 1 stack from buise then he dont heal that much !!
[0:34:26] Breakfist_: stand and hit 4Head
[0:34:26] Psico_420: I heard that if his hp reaches 0 he dies
[0:34:29] unstawpable91: what if you have to have him kill players with alot of blood and gets "full"
[0:34:33] peat__: Make sure to bring his health to 0
[0:34:33] ikkiweber: 255 count is a tech limitation, not a mechanic Û†ÄÄ

[0:34:40] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Slyratt cause the devs have been hinting at it
[0:34:40] heyimtazz: I think we need to poison our blood somehow to hurt him when he leeches... maybe the new alchemy potion
[0:34:43] tinkerspelled: He's draining you with a similar debuff to hakkar's drain life, is there a debuff you can get that will give you posined debuff so when he drains it doesn't help???
[0:34:44] Almighty_kenzo: My question is why are the GMs always there? Why are they so worried? @xaryu
[0:34:46] bottis96: what other new items spawn in area when blood moon atarts
[0:34:49] billybeer181920: @Xaryu You have to get Mike Tyson to bite all his ears of
[0:34:49] knifeparty818: What if you have to turn in blood as you take him to an alter?

[0:34:58] bchamp93: keep on thinking about things that tie to the event instead of fight mechanics
[0:34:58] taylorsdank: @Almighty_kenzo i think theyre excited not worried
[0:34:58] Taxsvcs: @Xaryu  Are there any vods showing him healing past 20%? Only need bloods if he is healing right?
[0:34:59] ogkoop: I'll use my gnomer helm on use in last phase
[0:35:00] Cuddle_Bunz: @Xaryu what are all the different mechanics of the STV event? it has to be something within the current mechanics
[0:35:00] A_Rodimus: what spec were you yesterday?
[0:35:00] Slyratt: why do we think there is a strat or it‚Äôs intended to be killed?
[0:35:02] Breakfist_: dont get DC'd 4Head
[0:35:02] Zownos: @Xaryu okay, You need to use White Weapons from SM. Use them to kill him at the alter.
[0:35:02] PROPANIAC: 255 is just the stats cap stack modifier he was up to 2600 kills/ears ydady
[0:35:02] stormlightcookie: just arcane surge him lol
[0:35:05] dramajohns: take him to ZG island, there might be an interaction with the npcs there. they are supposed to be enemies.

[0:35:09] packtar: do we know if his hp is related to the number of ears at 20%
[0:35:10] Locofanta: @Xaryu isnt the message from the GM same message u get when u turn in blood for coins? maybe there is a  connection

[0:35:17] limburgse: guards are asleep during event üôà
[0:35:19] purplewingedboa: The shrine has to be part of it. We already know that we need blood to stop healing but why have it spawn next to the shrines then?

[0:35:20] PMA_1: PMA_1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 7 month streak!

[0:35:22] swyftboi: Servers laggin already
[0:35:22] Kfclol2912: @Reaperz_kinetic no its not check logs from fight on reddit from LV Allianz Europe
[0:35:23] krotkowidze: just killl the boss and dont die 4Head
[0:35:23] Maloviz: Morning XarXar, you playing SF today?
[0:35:24] theyungdad: @Xaryu theres a jump spot to get on top of the arena might be a good strat to cheese the boss
[0:35:26] Townlol: I have a level 70 Priest I can bring him over
[0:35:26] kingcherryholme: will there be drops ? Û†ÄÄ
[0:35:29] A1K_GAMING: i think you must minimize the amount of ears boss gets

[0:35:59] ShingaTV: +
[0:36:00] curedubs: enrage phase PogU
[0:36:02] TheeMLG: Kha‚ÄôDamu is an event about sacrificing blood what if he takes damage when he deals overkill damage.  the bruises debuff makes it so you can no longer sacrifice yourself as he can‚Äôt execute you.  also there‚Äôs irritated set that reduces stamina (why would this exist). also there‚Äôs a mildly irritated potion from alchemy which increases damage taken by 100%
[0:36:02] iPlayCuzFun: maybe BOSS does a LAST STAND that refreshes when he kills someone
[0:36:04] limburgse: jup
[0:36:05] joestopfarmingshako: Guzus screen is a forehead
[0:36:05] KosmicDevil_: I said this like 3 times yesterday ;-;

[0:36:09] legendarism: @Almighty_kenzo it is they rigged it yday cuz it was going down
[0:36:11] tinkerspelled: He's draining you with a similar debuff to hakkar's drain life, is there a debuff you can get that will give you posined debuff so when he drains it doesn't help???
[0:36:11] Desolate_e36: all i see is forehead
[0:36:13] smokeshash: i dont think the # of kills he gets will make a diffrence i think that it just needs to be pumped out
[0:36:14] flo_406: maybe people need more blood going into 20%
[0:36:16] xChiip95: is ssf on a fresh server?
[0:36:17] zen0vae: i think he heats the bloods
[0:36:19] infuze27: what does he say in demonic?!
[0:36:20] creamybzh: tranq shot
[0:36:21] zen0vae: eats
[0:36:21] bamfosaurus: Its gotta be turning in blood at that point, GM was kiting him to altar during our atempt yesterday @Xaryu
[0:36:22] tywilldoittv: Did you guys consider bringing speed ehancements, and just if you get aggro run for your life so he isn't healing as much or is that irrelevant?
[0:36:22] Zownos: @Xaryu okay, You need to use White Weapons from SM. Use them to kill him at the alter.
[0:36:22] HelluvaWrecks: if guzus forehead cant kill it, it must be powerful
[0:36:22] Dead_Seeker: Get the debuff to not participate on the blood event and try kill the boss @xaryu
[0:36:23] calvescere: what does brute force mean
[0:36:23] astrix25: turn in blood
[0:36:24] theyungdad: tranq shot sounds likely
[0:36:25] IanEdgerton: unboon and pop consumes to burn
[0:36:25] bryn_dee: What if he isn't meant to be killed and the devs are just trolling us all by giving us something to do outside of the raid
[0:36:27] chasingshadowsz: NOPE
[0:36:28] ChiCity312: get his HP to zero
[0:36:28] Erwincrates: lag less..... bro
[0:36:30] omnipresentbe1ng: secret 3rd phase at 0% monkaW @Xaryu
[0:36:30] maiverx: no way
[0:36:31] SaucePlays_: @Xaryu do you think it has anything to do with the arena?
[0:36:31] ShingaTV: yep
[0:36:33] purplewingedboa: Could blood turn in deal damage or counteract the buff?
[0:36:33] Locofanta: @Xaryu isnt the message from  GM same message u get when u turn in blood for coins? maybe there is a  connection
[0:36:33] 13brill: THE COAGULATE POTION
[0:36:34] Kfclol2912: @Reaperz_kinetic yeah dont need, but when u have the blood and the  bruise debuff boss heals less from you
[0:36:35] iPlayCuzFun: maybe BOSS does a LAST STAND that refreshes when he kills someone! so u have to kite him for 20sec
[0:36:35] Almighty_kenzo: @legendarism it makes sense. üëÄ
[0:36:35] smokeshash: ive watched it 4 times now

[0:36:38] Tjeezy93: Is it at 255 ears????
[0:36:38] Xeonik11: maybe without reconnect boss prolly will go down
[0:36:39] hache_esse: chain shield wall
[0:36:40] fartguyl: @Xaryu was a gm hitting the boss when he dropped really fast in arena?
[0:36:40] peat__: Do we think the forehead is part of the enrage?
[0:36:42] meguidokun: thats impossible sadly, people are trash
[0:36:44] lil_yahteez: 20% or is it time left in event
[0:36:44] ogkoop: Ya ppl need to not chain lightning ppl lol

[0:36:46] mitsankladan: you have to get on phase 2 before 20minute
[0:36:46] ikkiweber: no way the intended way to kill is to bring 1000 people to the same layer
[0:36:48] Seithr9: @Xaryu we tried the turn in at 20% at the 6pm event, didn't work Û†ÄÄ
[0:36:49] KosmicDevil_: what if doing damage is the issue and we need to not do damage on that phase
[0:36:51] booddhi: @Xaryu he might have been healing becuiase you opted out

[0:36:52] ggmage60: what do you suggest for Fat burning? I've seen some Fat Burners pills but I do not trust them really. What do you think?

[0:36:53] ooxtv: all pet taunt
[0:36:54] purplewingedboa: Blood turn in at 10 mins?
[0:36:54] twisted_127: a pvp event bliz wants u to work together? weird
[0:36:55] TheCraigJr: doesnt work
[0:36:56] beezelbuub: would they want everyone not killing eachother in the pvp event
[0:36:57] TheeMLG: Kha‚ÄôDamu is an event about sacrificing blood what if he takes damage when he deals overkill damage.  the bruises debuff makes it so you can no longer sacrifice yourself as he can‚Äôt execute you.  also there‚Äôs irritated set that reduces stamina (why would this exist). also there‚Äôs a mildly irritated potion from alchemy which increases damage taken by 100%
[0:36:58] leiferikson4541: when you turn in blooods

[0:37:05] MongoSecurity: He may heal but then maybe he cant heal back the 2nd time?
[0:37:06] mundanesickle: @iPlayCuzFun Makes no sense
[0:37:07] leiferikson4541: arnet you?
[0:37:07] grizzlyhead: has anyone killed it before?
[0:37:08] Reaperz_kinetic: @kfclol2912 the boss heals less if you just have any amount of bloods. it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have 1 or 255
[0:37:09] gh00775: JUST PUMP!!!!
[0:37:13] leiferikson4541: why woudl that help
[0:37:15] knifeparty818: i think its just a DPS race
[0:37:19] Oreo_Swagwagon: @Xaryu What if it involves the new white weapons dropped in SM? The Ancestral Sword etc.
[0:37:22] t1isokatleague: turning in bloods really guys....
[0:37:24] packtar: did you or anyone else get the "supposed" book in Gnomer
[0:37:24] tinkerspelled: The machanic feels like HAKKAR - look for a debuff

[0:37:29] iPlayCuzFun: @mundanesickle nothing makes sense
[0:37:29] Zownos: @Xaryu what if its because you're in a raid and you just have to set up individual 5 man groups...
[0:37:30] blaaaaakee: what if its healing off damage spells and you need to kill it with healing spells....
[0:37:30] hollywoodz007: I would try turn in blood an risk it he goes in frenzy an hunts blood so what if you turned them in an he wasn‚Äôt able to
[0:37:31] curedubs: we were 9mil short
[0:37:32] eyonixz: it just clearly wasnt suppose to be killed its just a NPC for the event you tinfoil hat guys
[0:37:34] Dead_Seeker: Get the debuff outside zone event
[0:37:34] curedubs: thats a lot of hp
[0:37:36] ikkiweber: no way its a dps race, we had 500+ people
[0:37:37] legendarism: it just dosnt make sense
[0:37:37] enigmasvea: @Xaryu just bring lots of mortal strike effects, they stack
[0:37:38] cutexlol_: 1
[0:37:38] t1isokatleague: ppl are undergeared

[0:37:40] StunningPaul: Can Bruce force it if there no lag
[0:37:40] booddhi: @Xaryu you might not even need to have blood debuff. he may have been healing because you opted out
[0:37:40] SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME: what happens if the boss gets kited out of the zone?
[0:37:41] ddevillax: ragnaros has 2.1m
[0:37:43] TheeMLG: @xaryu Kha‚ÄôDamu is an event about sacrificing blood what if he takes damage when he deals overkill damage.  the bruises debuff makes it so you can no longer sacrifice yourself as he can‚Äôt execute you.  also there‚Äôs irritated set that reduces stamina (why would this exist). also there‚Äôs a mildly irritated potion from alchemy which increases damage taken by 100%
[0:37:43] thebigdongerhere: Its like nothing
[0:37:43] ogkoop: Was the lag and DC due to the event, or was it a legit ddos?
[0:37:44] kirk_hunts: As a hunter that doesn't sound like much
[0:37:44] ripwarlock2: they wouldnt tune something to be killed by 2000 people
[0:37:46] kamelius91: he will get healed in p2 for every blood
[0:37:46] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: We're stronger than vanilla 60s tho

[0:37:52] muderok: Heoric LK has 100 mill
[0:37:52] Breakfist_: i feel like u guys couldve done it if u didnt get DC'd over and over
[0:37:54] enigmasvea: @Xaryu mortal strike effects stacks YEP
[0:37:54] ddevillax: naxx bosses have 3m
[0:37:54] elendo: people killing each other was by far the biggest problem for EU, we had way less people than you though, there were no disconnects or crashes and not THAT much lag, i honestly think having like 200 people is better than 500
[0:37:56] blind3d_: @kirk_hunts KEKW
[0:37:58] Locofanta: @Xaryu isnt the message from  GM same message u get when u turn in blood for coins? maybe there is a  connection

[0:38:00] McNerdSauce: EZ
[0:38:01] Oreo_Swagwagon: @Xaryu What if it involves the new white weapons dropped in SM? The Ancestral Sword etc.
[0:38:02] OneAndOnlyAron: it's not even confirmed that that's why he didnt heal. you changed so many things from attempt one to two. opt-in, now 40 mans, had blood it could be any of those things
[0:38:03] iPlayCuzFun: maybe he does a LAST STAND that refreshes when he kills someone!
[0:38:03] SuperLost89: @Xaryu do you think going into a raid group with 40 ppl AFTER getting stacks of blood would be better than a bunch of 5 mans killing each other?
[0:38:04] gradygauntlet: Only 1 faction?
[0:38:06] drishx: Do .kill on him SmileW
[0:38:07] yashatheboi: I wonder if he needs to eat someone with the irradiated set
[0:38:07] holymuffin90: ever thought he was not intended to be killed, just flavour for the bloodmoon event?
[0:38:07] kamelius91: dont bring blood to altar

[0:38:10] zen0vae: has to do with bloods
[0:38:11] ddevillax: ask shobek @Xaryu
[0:38:11] hamcheesetoastie56: @Xaryu drag him to an altar
[0:38:12] Cuddle_Bunz: @Xaryu did anyone mouse over the ear debuff to see exactly what it says? or any of the buffs the boss had?
[0:38:12] YorkieKilla: search the item database
[0:38:13] ponaris: All /kneel or something
[0:38:13] Reaperz_kinetic: @scaredmoneywontmakemoney no we‚Äôre not we just have like 500 players instead of 40 lol
[0:38:14] The_palumbo: Being opted IN to the event has to be part of it
[0:38:14] curedubs: i think yojamba or the water, maybe it cleans the blood? idk thikng lore wise
[0:38:14] A1K_GAMING: Minimize the amount of kills the boss gets
[0:38:15] ShingaTV: i mean you can prevent the stacks so he doesnt get much hp
[0:38:16] Teokin: I thnk you actually need to look in STV with a buncho f people to find the lore
[0:38:17] JokiGhostCrew: I mean, have the even announced that he is killable?
[0:38:18] leiferikson4541: tranq shot?

[0:38:19] BadGerbilLion: XAR the stealthed 70 elites bro
[0:38:19] Townlol: Everyone /pray all at the same time when he hits 20%
[0:38:20] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu If 340 people do 50k damage in phase 2 it will die
[0:38:21] kswissbaby: did you see the new post on Reddit about ppl wanting to grief you because GMs helped lol

[0:43:30] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: from a raid design perspective, it really feels like they would just want it to be overcome when the horde and alliance stop fighting
[0:43:30] MUNCH1E5: Maybe he can't swim, just drown him.
[0:43:30] tinkerspelled: He's draining you with a similar debuff to hakkar's drain life, is there a debuff you can get that will give you posined debuff so when he drains it doesn't help?? its a common blood mechanic from classic wow - you need to poison him and use his life drain against him - recall sunken temple and ZG mechanics along with that troll instance from wrtath

[0:44:13] unsteddy: NPC in STV gives you a buff
[0:44:13] mav3r1ck87: Aren't ears are associated with a Mak'gora from hardcore. Maybe when he is at 20% you have to /Makgora him. Mount drops if you beat him.
[0:44:14] largist_: Maybe you need something from ST raid,  and killing the boss is intended for next phase
[0:44:16] zen0vae: sacrifice a player with max bloods
[0:44:16] GuperGER: I think it has something to do with the ear buff he has @Xaryu

[0:44:35] totuudentorvi22: no clue but imma say yes
[0:44:35] timcurrying: Seems like irradiated objects would be great lore wise. Hakkar took more damage when we had "corrupted blood"
[0:44:36] crainiam: But chat, why would GMs care if they killed him or not? Doesn't  affect anything
[0:44:37] ParfumAmerican: why is he there?

[0:44:47] Mahca_: his boss went to 13 mil at 20%
[0:44:49] Xeonik11: dont think so.. think guzu just had way less people
[0:44:49] SuperLost89: @Xaryu the new bombss you can buy on the AH slow the target by 25% for 1 seconds. maybe you can spam them on the boss to lower his speed and you can kit him better?  less deaths?
[0:44:50] mitsankladan: Kha damu one of his ability is Blood leech which drains 415 to 535 health from nearby enemies, healing the caster for up to twice the amount stolen. AND Druids have Blood drive spell which can use on it
[0:44:53] lil_yahteez: why is the ear buff stacked at 255, do other buffs in history of WoW stop there?
[0:44:53] A_Rodimus: you have to get a buff from killing every single person in STV while staying alive, battle royale style

[0:45:06] mundanesickle: @Xaryu Deal with it shades = One shot boss
[0:45:07] purplewingedboa: Maybe pvp is part of the puzzle? The event was meant to be pvp free for all. Could the boss take damage from leaching players with active debuffs or something like that?
[0:45:10] tinkerspelled: He's draining you with a similar debuff to hakkar's drain life, is there a debuff you can get that will give you posined debuff so when he drains it doesn't help?? its a common blood mechanic from classic wow - you need to poison him and use his life drain against him - recall sunken temple and ZG mechanics along with that troll instance from wrtath
[0:45:11] unstawpable91: @Xaryu what if he heals more from killing bruised players, and you have to have alot of blood as he kills you.
[0:45:11] WorldofRunic: Maybe you have to do something similar to the Hakkar Mechanics? Is there a way to de-buff him?
[0:45:11] Griff_666: THE TRINKET THAT SHRINKS THE WORLD AROUND YOU XARYU !!!!!!!\

[0:49:38] t1isokatleague: can someone read what blood loa says in demonic? @Xaryu
[0:49:40] cadetk9: metea warlocks can
[0:49:41] threatzky: 100 paladins with full reckoning stacks
[0:49:42] thebigdongerhere: No
[0:49:42] twisted_127: world shrinker gnomer item
[0:49:44] Craigumander: @Kilraith arcane explosion is
[0:49:44] Griff_666: THE TRINKET THAT SHRINKS THE WORLD AROUND YOU XARYU !!!!!
[0:49:44] thandelmtj: Maybe that boss is just meant to be done with higher lvl
[0:49:46] mundanesickle: Yes
[0:49:48] iPlayCuzFun: maybe he does a LAST STAND that refreshes when he kills someone!
[0:49:50] ichewbubblegumm: alright alright alrigth
[0:49:53] Kritisk: You need to kite him into gurubashi arena and make him trip down into the arena to break his kneecaps @Xaryu
[0:49:55] tinkerspelled: He's draining you with a similar debuff to hakkar's drain life, is there a debuff you can get that will give you posined debuff so when he drains it doesn't help?? its a common blood mechanic from classic wow - you need to poison him and use his life drain against him - recall sunken temple and ZG mechanics along with that troll instance from wrtath - you're overthinking it
[0:49:56] ddevillax: if u cant kill it today are u giving up @Xaryu ? what if its meant to be killed at 60?
[0:49:56] BadGerbilLion: @Xaryu same hp, not dynamic, but with fewer people and fewer deaths we did solid damage
[0:49:57] blaaaaakee: what if you need a raid size group and its something to do with that debuff
[0:49:58] dingoath97: plans on an alt xar?
[0:49:58] Oogiman: @Xaryu heres a wild idea, CHECK StRANGLESTHORN AS A GHOST FOR SOME INFOMATION LOAS ARE SPIRITS AFTERALL
[0:49:58] spotligh7: hey xar did you cut your hair? looking good
[0:50:02] realandtruephobe: The bosses health pool jumped again with staysafe
[0:50:03] jbeemerks: @tzeibeer they did. it was a fail.
[0:50:04] lukeclev: GET THE HAKAR DEBUFF
[0:50:05] letsgoforsen123: Maybe the boss is unkillable
[0:50:06] twisted_127: gnomer item world shrinker
[0:50:07] osopolar1977: Mortal strike
[0:50:11] Loodimus: maybe before phase change you turn in bloods
[0:50:12] Constera: @Xaryu At 20%, maybe if everyone turns in a bunch of blood coins as an offering, it might remove the "enrage" buff he gets
[0:50:13] yami_yugi_87: I think it has to do with getting a group or something at the Altar of Zanza the tablet says "We call upon you, Zanza of Zuldazar Bless Those that ask for your help Loa Zanza Bless those that would ally with the Zandalarian people aid us in this time of need. Aid us LOA give us the power to strike down our enemies. Give us the power to once more defeat the blood god
[0:50:17] Griff_666: THE TRINKET THAT SHRINKS THE WORLD AROUND YOU XARYU !!!!!
[0:50:17] Rheyn3: Is self found out yet?
[0:50:18] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu the boss has more hp than bosses in Naxx 40 man, is doing this at lvl 40 possible?
[0:50:18] bryn_dee: Blood for the blood loa.. what if he ISNT supposed to be killed and instead you give him enough blood and he becomes friendly and gives you a reward??
[0:50:20] booneytoonz: Maybe you drag him to ZG Island or something? Or kite him somewhere else?
[0:50:25] 13brill: Noggenfogger elixirs, cant suck blood from a skeleton
[0:50:30] iPlayCuzFun: @Rheyn3 in like 5 hrs
[0:50:35] Paramaum: bro, whenever I tune in you're always theorycrafting some new build/skills KEKW
[0:50:35] KaneOdex: was a good idea though
[0:50:38] SilentWisco: I think the boss isnt meant to be killed tbh
[0:50:41] mav3r1ck87: /makgora him
[0:50:41] WakeGG: They tried that
[0:50:42] TheCraigJr: The Altar at Yojamba might be special, its a way bigger altar with blood symbols around it! @Xaryu
[0:50:42] lukeclev: IT IS HAKARR BLOOD PLAGUE
[0:50:43] Locofanta: @Xaryu The message from  GM is same message u get when u turn in blood? maybe there is a  connection
[0:50:44] jbeemerks: pray at the altar in Yojamba
[0:50:47] baldanduseless: maybe theres a unmarked altar that interacts with him? @Xaryu
[0:50:47] drewskii318: debuff from raid ? could that affect him? would make sense if the play is to ‚Äúwork together‚Äù
[0:50:48] gladiuss27: that‚Äôs what I meant, when he kills someone it gives him bloods and eventually buffs him
[0:50:49] pockets519: something to do with the debuff he give you when he kills you
[0:50:49] WakeGG: Nothing seemed to happen
[0:50:52] ellgthompson: guzu tried in EU an hour ago and same thing happened at 20% deffo a mechanic
[0:50:52] Petr0star: drag him into the water and wash it away
[0:50:54] joestopfarmingshako: True /makgora
[0:50:57] daschadwick: KEKW
[0:50:58] simplegeoffy: Maybe you need a shaman with the sapta so he can see the spirits
[0:51:00] daschadwick: owned
[0:51:00] packtar: what about the item that allows you to speak to dead people would that be worth checking out
[0:51:00] Phrosted_: what if people turning in blood while boss is on the altar does big dam to him
[0:51:02] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: hes turnign with keys
[0:51:14] ddevillax: RIP its a shadow priest
[0:51:16] swyftboi: Maybe talk to the boss while dead... he could have a B-side since he's kind of a death god.
[0:51:20] ThisIsBrutus: it has to be some interaction with blood / debuffs from him.. No illuminati "kite him to africa" strat is needed, that would be dumb
[0:51:21] totuudentorvi22: Where did the rumour begin that this boss is killable? Can any1 link to the post or smth in private
[0:51:28] Griff_666: THE GNOMER TRINKET THAT SHRINKS THE WORLD AROUND YOU XARYU !!!!!
[0:51:29] detourz28: Where is Bwonsamdi when we need him.
[0:51:31] Paramaum: YIKES
[0:51:32] pixelatedfrodo: priests are awesome
[0:51:36] hollywoodxJ: are there any tablets in Sunken temple to read?
[0:51:37] booddhi: @Xaryu has anyone been at the altar at the time of the event when he is at 20%?
[0:51:39] Saint_Vallion: KEKW
[0:51:39] twisted_127: _World Shrinker _ gnomer item
[0:51:40] bryn_dee: Blood for the blood loa.. what if he ISNT supposed to be killed and instead you give him enough blood and he becomes friendly and gives you a reward??
[0:51:40] llMookie: xdd
[0:51:41] nicopendais: LOL
[0:51:42] ddevillax: rip its shadow priest season
[0:51:42] Constera: @Xaryu At 20%, maybe if everyone turns in a bunch of blood coins as an offering, it might remove the "enrage" buff he gets
[0:51:43] BingoTingler: HE USED THE SHADOW WORD DEATH TO BREAK HIS SHEEP WHAT A GOD
[0:51:43] Dead_Seeker: @xaryu  maybe Zandallar Ward buff is the strat
[0:51:43] Jjinks: KEKw
[0:51:43] Himaru7: he swd your sheep u have a rival
[0:51:44] Locdawg: Lol
[0:51:44] f4a_tony: what a class LUL
[0:51:44] lyleneththedruid: LMAO

[0:51:47] daschadwick: that lag was tough
[0:51:50] tjaea: Maybe have someone who have the Arena Grand Master take one hit. Probably wont work but hey.
[0:51:51] Griff_666: THE GNOMER TRINKET THAT SHRINKS THE WORLD AROUND YOU XARYU !!!!!!
[0:51:51] joestopfarmingshako: Dots op
[0:51:52] realstickybluntz: @xaryu try summoning Bwonsamdi to get his azz
[0:51:53] Zownos: @xaryu When the Aztecs sacrificed people to Huitzilopochtli (the god with warlike aspects) the victim would be placed on a sacrificial stone. The priest would then cut through the abdomen with an obsidian or flint blade. The heart would be torn out still beating and held towards the sky in honor to the Sun-God. Maybe you need someone using the Obsidian Cleaver from Uldaman??
[0:51:53] booddhi: @Xaryu has anyone been at the altar at the time of the event when he is at 20%?.
[0:51:55] zaguidar92: best stream
[0:51:57] ddevillax: shadow priest season
[0:51:58] bmcclain99: horde always respect the 1v1
[0:52:04] KosmicDevil_: @bmcclain99 not true
[0:52:05] booddhi: @Xaryu has anyone been at the altar at the time of the event when he is at 20%
[0:52:05] bottis96: did you ever figure out why the attempt in the arena ramp area he took so much damage from 90% to 50% so fast??
[0:52:10] cookie_jayy: No when you get i ncombat the buff goes away
[0:52:12] zaguidar92: no they dont
[0:52:14] sabastro007: i have it but combat breaks it
[0:52:14] BingoTingler: Season of Shadow Priest
[0:52:17] JukeboxHey: I am sure that you should kill it in the gurubashi arena man, I know you were there. But this is where he will die. @Xaryu
[0:52:19] theDRG: All that trinket does is makes you larger right?
[0:52:20] DrSkittles: ZG Altar island might be worth?
[0:52:20] Sakarith_: @bottis96 prob a gm
[0:52:21] Plokoon100: u shrink and you attack khis belly
[0:52:23] Griff_666: Try it i bet it works
[0:52:24] osopolar1977: one time I respect 1v1 I got cussed out
[0:52:25] sacrifaidxd: or trogger trinket
[0:52:25] zaguidar92: west?
[0:52:25] curedubs: yes
[0:52:25] Kritisk: Everyone has to use the radiant ray reflectors @Xaryu
[0:52:26] Highmen3: Yes
[0:52:27] Loodimus: but as soon as you attack the trinket use goes away that‚Äôs not it
[0:52:27] TheCraigJr: The Altar at Yojamba might be special, its a way bigger altar with blood symbols around it! @Xaryu
[0:52:27] zartuus: we go for 20 angry chicken tricket at the same time
[0:52:28] FrostsWorld: Island
[0:52:30] ttvnorbitaker: on his island
[0:52:30] jxperience: @Xaryu you think that staff you have is good for shadow p?
[0:52:31] Jumballaya: the ZG rep island
[0:52:31] WheezyFbaby_: maybe to kill boss just crash the server again and have a GM kill it for you
[0:52:31] lukemeleney: can you please use the random teleport trinket today? I feel like it's a great post Blood Lord try moment
[0:52:33] lemonarque: He's only killable if nobody groups with boomkins for the STV event. Alternatively boomkins can log out during the event and delete their characters, which instantly kills the boss
[0:52:33] Locofanta: @Xaryu The message from  GM is same message u get when u turn in blood? maybe there is a  connection
[0:52:34] Phrosted_: @Xaryu maybe people need to turn in blood while hes on the altar
[0:52:34] oxzide92: oxzide92 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:52:35] cookie_jayy: chat is cooking too hard
[0:52:38] youwiththefeds: What if one altar gets like lit up when the boss hits 20%
[0:52:39] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu the boss has more hp than bosses in Naxx 40 man, is doing this at lvl 40 possible?
[0:52:41] Synthez542: @Xaryu Have you saw Aggrends Twitter background picture? Is that some cryptic image for the boss location?
[0:52:43] Constera: @Xaryu At 20%, maybe if everyone turns in a bunch of blood coins as an offering, it might remove the "enrage" buff he gets Û†ÄÄ
[0:52:43] curedubs: i think yojamba is the play, we sacrifice him out there
[0:52:43] notdecrease: na no chance
[0:52:44] McNerdSauce: doesnt make sense. they didnt put new alters in for yall to take to an existing one
[0:52:44] hollywoodxJ: are there any tablets in Sunken Temple to possibly read?
[0:52:46] zaguidar92: troll island LOGIC
[0:52:46] sdotpuff: As soon as u do dmg it goes away
[0:52:46] Swapzz_: I swear the GM being near boss scaled the boss HP and trolled you guys
[0:52:47] BergEsquire: The boss does swim super fast
[0:52:48] KosmicDevil_: should we try fighting him in the pic for aggrends banner on twitter?
[0:52:49] booddhi: @Xaryu you may just need some people there not bring the boss there
[0:52:49] iPlayCuzFun: whoever said drown him yesterday was onto something
[0:52:50] mundanesickle: Altar on the ZG island near Westfall
[0:52:51] Bronloch: maybe drag him to the arena?
[0:52:52] bryn_dee: @Xaryu lets circle back to Aggrends tweet hint: Blood for the Blood Loa... What if instead of killing the boss, we are supposed to be turning in a shitakki amount of blood on the altar nearest him and then he becomes friendly and gives a reward??
[0:52:54] ellgthompson: that would be way too annoying
[0:52:55] realstickybluntz: bwonsamdi was so funny when you died in BFA üòÇ
[0:52:55] PewPewCatchoo: does he aggro zg elites?
[0:52:58] SmashTheDude: what if in order to weaken people in raid the boss gets weaker himself? @Xaryu Û†ÄÄ
[0:52:58] osopolar1977: Blood makes grass grow
[0:52:59] packtar: that could be a long kite depending on the spawn point
[0:52:59] BergEsquire: Confirmed this morning he will swim
[0:52:59] zenjars: that island is also on approximate 20,20 location
[0:53:00] Dead_Seeker: Zandallar Ward buff
[0:53:05] Qiima1: i dont think you need to bring boss to altar bc hes random spawn so it wont fit in the tacs
[0:53:05] guidogang: @lemonarque lol
[0:53:05] ChiCity312: just get his HP to zero
[0:53:05] runnesvoid: since he spawns randmly in 4 spots the place should be near all of those spots
[0:53:06] NotGaffin: turn in blood = to ears to remove buff, idk
[0:53:07] gorebag13: he swims above the water
[0:53:09] cykoblast: maybe has something to do with the moving ghost
[0:53:10] booneytoonz: Guzu tried in the water earlier. did nothing
[0:53:19] 13brill: Oh theres another quest area with an altar where you can pick up a potion
[0:53:21] tala____: kiting doesnt seem like the correct call since his spawn is random
[0:53:23] plumpus81: he needs to be kited to troll area in EPL in the northeast corner
[0:53:25] snyderhauss: snyderhauss subscribed with Prime. 
[0:53:27] kirk_hunts: copium
[0:53:28] paladan_tich: does anyone have the vod link to eu kill?
[0:53:28] catbalou2: Its just a pure DPS check...so wasnt meant to die in this phase
[0:53:29] Jibbaholic: what if you get a buff or something for turning in blood at every alter?
[0:53:30] drewskii318: raid debuff affects the way he heals ?
[0:53:30] Jumballaya: probably not the strat, but maybe you can kite it out of the bloodmoon (duskwood?) and kill him
[0:53:31] pixelatedfrodo: does only one person get the bengal tiger?
[0:53:32] ShingaTV: copium
[0:53:32] CuppaCoffeh: Guzu had spawn at beach
[0:53:32] gradygauntlet: Is there any way to have people sacrifice themselves on the alter to take away his buff?
[0:53:34] pmanfit91: Everyone seems to be fighting at the boss, now. There's no more fighting at altars anymore.
[0:53:35] heyimtazz: i feel like its pretty equally zg/beach/arena
[0:53:36] SneakyBeaverr: it spawns there everytime 20% of the time
[0:53:37] WhudaFxUp: Kiting doesn't make sense. Otherwise he would have only 1 spawn.
[0:53:38] everganaj: we might just need some luck with spawn and lag to get max dps uptime
[0:53:38] fartguyl: spawned way at bottom for staysafe
[0:53:39] joestopfarmingshako: Feels like depends on where most players are
[0:53:41] JEM_GG: Is ssf live?
[0:53:41] packtar: kite to fatigue zone?  lol
[0:53:42] Thefoog777: are the wow secret finding and collections discord work on this ? they are insane @Xaryu
[0:53:48] Dead_Seeker: Zandallar Ward buff
[0:53:50] jbeemerks: seen him everywhere
[0:53:52] ShingaTV: feeling like it yes but aint^^
[0:53:55] booneytoonz: Gotta kite him to the dark portal and illidan will spawn to kill him
[0:53:57] WheezyFbaby_: maybe to kill boss just crash the server again and have a GM kill it for you
[0:53:57] rawrifanclub: what about the ZG buff island where you turn in bijou?
[0:53:57] Saint_Vallion: try the banner spot @Xaryu
[0:54:03] Saint_Vallion: under the moon
[0:54:04] JEM_GG: Oh cool ty
[0:54:11] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu do you think the location in the p2 annoucment photo might be something? I know devs like putting small hints in stuff so maybe somethign about this place? https://twitter.com/AggrendWoW/header_photo
[0:54:13] hunigsbase: did you cut your hair?
[0:54:14] tjaea: Maybe have someone who have the Arena Grand Master take one hit. Probably wont work but hey.
[0:54:17] bryn_dee: Aggrends tweet hint: Blood for the Blood Loa... What if instead of killing the boss, we are supposed to be turning in a shitakki amount of blood on the altar nearest him and then he becomes friendly and gives a reward??
[0:54:17] gnated: STaysafe i guy pulled him under water to drown he reset
[0:54:20] encrypteddeath: Xaryu, have you ever had people recognize you at like your local grocery store?
[0:54:21] JEM_GG: There is something about the ears I swear
[0:54:22] monoboxtv: We have so few brains tho :(
[0:54:24] kirk_hunts: I do most events it spawns near altars, it has a 60% chance to spawn in northern STV due to 3 altars north and 40% chance tospawn south 2 altars in south
[0:54:24] Saint_Vallion: 5Head skitzo police
[0:54:26] saintfrancis: kite to where the vendor for the tiger is supposed to be?
[0:54:28] monoboxtv: I'm rocking a peanut
[0:54:29] ShingaTV: only big altar makes sense to me at 20%
[0:54:31] Locofanta: @Xaryu The message from  GM is same message u get when u turn in blood? maybe there is a  connection
[0:54:32] Saint_Vallion: KEKW
[0:54:32] Rumseyrum04: dragging him somewhere doesn‚Äôt make sense just like opting out of the event didn‚Äôt make sense
[0:54:33] Unfragged: Unfragged subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:54:35] xlineagefreek: you need whatever blizzard employee knew about sleeping bag 2 hours into P2
[0:54:36] lemonarque: He's only killable if nobody groups with boomkins for the STV event. Alternatively boomkins can log out during the event and delete their characters, which instantly kills the boss
[0:54:37] baldanduseless: we are twitch chat andys not dataminers
[0:54:38] xlineagefreek: find that guy
[0:54:41] packtar: do mobs die to fatigue
[0:54:42] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu do you think the location in the p2 annoucment photo might be something? I know devs like putting small hints in stuff so maybe somethign about this place? https://twitter.com/AggrendWoW/header_photo
[0:54:42] blaaaaakee: ya what if a beacon spawns or something like where the most bloods were turned in
[0:54:47] rawlexdota: Try turn in bloods at bijou altar
[0:54:54] Deatharmor98: @lemonarque Boomkins are ez asf to kill
[0:54:54] jstuwie: iF HE SPAWNS NEAR THE CAVE....MAYBE TAKE HIM TO CAVE
[0:54:55] Bronloch: drag him to arena maybe he can only be killed inside Gurubashi?
[0:55:00] zadidax: Its gotta be like hakkar you need a posion debuff to prevent him from healing or something
[0:55:01] PROPANIAC: thats just the beach altar
[0:55:01] kirk_hunts: THat's Zanzil
[0:55:01] Oogiman: i said that yesterday
[0:55:02] bhigg32: beach!
[0:55:02] TMMOOF: is that an undead?
[0:55:05] crainiam: nah, guzu was killing him there earlier
[0:55:07] jbeemerks: big dps with no lag = gg ez tiger
[0:55:08] Saint_Vallion: Clueless
[0:55:13] ShingaTV: hopefully^^
[0:55:13] DrJamesBuchamomile: agreed, kiting sounds lame
[0:55:14] Saint_Vallion: thats what a blizzard dev would say
[0:55:16] ketchgg: its gotta be more simple
[0:55:16] Imboz: the kill was probably not intended at all
[0:55:17] BeansAnToast: drag him into the arena
[0:55:18] wester19: Gonna be playing SOD or SSF today @Xaryu ?
[0:55:19] SirSaeldor: true
[0:55:19] ConceptualDesigns: i dont think it'd be locational for that reason
[0:55:20] Jehl703: Maybe each person he kills increases his HP at 20% (phase 2)
[0:55:20] Thomasdurso: Thomasdurso subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:55:20] Okizoo: did they intend for it to be killed?
[0:55:21] Udenwo: check the spot where that person is standing in the photo
[0:55:23] Lewbra: do you think they intended the boss to be killed at this point?
[0:55:23] zadidax: Its gotta be like hakkar you need a posion debuff to prevent him from healing or somethingggg
[0:55:23] BingoTingler: sounds insanely engaging? huh
[0:55:24] ichewbubblegumm: agreed
[0:55:24] Thisguymattb7: what if you turn in bloods at 20%?
[0:55:24] bryn_dee: Aggrends tweet hint: Blood for the Blood Loa... What if instead of killing the boss, we are supposed to be turning in a shitakki amount of blood on the altar nearest him and then he becomes friendly and gives a reward??
[0:55:26] snyderhauss: Doesn't sound fun; people do that all the time with world bosses to main cites lol
[0:55:26] Jehl703: so less deaths will make iteasier
[0:55:26] bamfshot: i dont think they intended for it to be killed at all
[0:55:27] StaysafeTV: ya agreed, I also doubt they need us to have like 400 people to kill him. there has to be some mechanic
[0:55:27] Shuttlelol: why not?
[0:55:27] nicopausz: is it even confirmed that the boss is killable? @Xaryu
[0:55:29] ketchgg: you figured out how to stop his heal, its simple and easy
[0:55:30] BeansAnToast: need to kill him in the arena
[0:55:31] Fai_z: not the way God intended
[0:55:34] kirk_hunts: Maybe we just gotta put him back inside ZG
[0:55:34] hutchyy917: says that my prime sub will be available on 2/29 but no option to prime sub lol
[0:55:35] jujujay_myalias: Has anyone rewatched the blizzcon announcement? I feel like she was hinting a lot in nthat speech
[0:55:36] mav3r1ck87: /makgora the boss at 20%
[0:55:38] pmanfit91: Just as well, it doesn't make sense if people need to be at other altars for anything to work. They'd miss out on any "loot"
[0:55:38] CuppaCoffeh: I would say try solo at 20%  (drop teams) but you will loss people with layers.
[0:55:41] Bronloch: KILL HIM IN GURUBASHI
[0:55:41] unsteddy: Blizzard created the ashenvale 'PVP' event --> dont think we can trust blizz xD
[0:55:43] Wrenzoe: @Xaryu Did Blizzard say anything about yesterday?
[0:55:43] ano_xy: Yeah but when p2 hits, somewhere on map can be some thing where certain thing have to be done - by other ppl not one fighting boss
[0:55:43] ShingaTV: i mean blizzard let people pull 60 mobs into stormwind what you expect :D
[0:55:43] biingb0ng: It doesnt make any sense which is why it makes total sense
[0:55:45] booddhi: @Xaryu what if you have a group at the big altar when hes at 20%
[0:55:46] StaysafeTV: nothing OMEGALUL
[0:55:49] blaaaaakee: Maybe theres a rune that hasnt been discovered in stv that everyone can get
[0:55:50] DrSkittles: Have ya'll tried to kill him inside the STV Arena?
[0:55:50] morfius09: create 2-3 groups of rogues to kill the griefers
[0:55:51] BingoTingler: You need the PVE brain
[0:55:51] jbeemerks: why would they make an unkillable boss? that would be lame af
[0:55:52] Plokoon100: sstvWAT
[0:55:53] shadowvypers: dont fight in gurabashi. People will lose bloods walking past loa to get back in arena
[0:55:54] HarryJPotter94: What is after phase 4 sod ?
[0:55:54] AbyssReborn: OMEGALUL
[0:55:55] drdoomkinx: what debuff do you get in a raid group

[0:55:56] cyond: Did anybody try anything when they were dead like looking for spirits to talk to
[0:56:00] billybeer181920: blizzard making this boss killable bcoz of you spergs
[0:56:01] melvinguyy: the world shrinker doesnt sound like a stupid idea
[0:56:01] Knocktoff: HUH
[0:56:01] hdvision0803: I honestly think it‚Äôs just the bloods then big burn phase at end
[0:56:02] Saint_Vallion: HUH
[0:56:04] bryn_dee: Aggrends tweet hint: Blood for the Blood Loa... What if instead of killing the boss, we are supposed to be turning in a shitakki amount of blood on the altar nearest him and then he becomes friendly and gives a reward??
[0:56:05] josephpeat: @Xaryu what if you guys just feed him souls till he explodes
[0:56:05] TheCraigJr: The Altar at Yojamba might be special, its a way bigger altar with blood symbols around it! @Xaryu
[0:56:05] StaysafeTV: ill put together a horde raid for it EZ
[0:56:07] Exxii11: HUH

[0:56:10] AbyssReborn: Mr. Pacific north wester !!!!
[0:56:11] Thisguymattb7: turn in bloods at 20%
[0:56:11] Jussthetip: what about each altar needs a certain amount of bloods to be turned in? or 255 turn in at each one?
[0:56:11] ShingaTV: @StaysafeTV moin
[0:56:12] Ananaass__: are we sure blizzard intented for us to kill it ?
[0:56:16] maximo469: maybe he needs to heal to full in phase 2?
[0:56:19] SmashTheDude: what if people need to starve the boss of blood, as in people need to have high blood and towards the end engage boss @Xaryu
[0:56:21] timothyx000: payoS payoS payoS payoS payoS

[0:56:25] Plokoon100: Yea he got weird this time
[0:56:26] M0rley_: they will just kill the horde. Dont other
[0:56:26] MaliceSP: The everyone must have a blood idea could be easily messed up by someone random in the area who doesn't know what's going on
[0:56:27] smorc_the_weed: @staysafetv can I maybe be unbanned in your chat I @ the wrong person I want to yell at someone flaming you

[0:56:37] grylz89: All the homies are horde
[0:56:37] JoeBangles_: What if you have to turn in blood at ever altar?
[0:56:38] jbeemerks: I heard if your dick is real big you can kill it.
[0:56:39] nicktamere666: yeah its him
[0:56:39] Voloric1: GIGACHAD Horde
[0:56:39] Astralthundr: Horde get shaman /shrug

[0:56:43] hearingblockchain: that priest killed u
[0:56:44] grubols: nazi in chat pog

[0:57:09] bojack359: What's thr lumber for
[0:57:09] IamTheBody: kill the priest
[0:57:10] PaxedUP: There is a chance the STV event has more to it in p3 or p4
[0:57:11] pockets519: what if it needs one of the pvp vendor mounts?
[0:57:12] Gamalimbo: What about trinkets that does SHADOWFLAME damage?
[0:57:14] Sqwibbie: @Tyromebiggums casters only anyways ofc KEKW
[0:57:15] zadidax: Gotta be like hakkar man
[0:57:18] spacetravelergaming: Maybe hes a fan of the blood raptor
[0:57:19] blaaaaakee: is there a new blood vendor somewhere?
[0:57:28] chrondor: Finish him in the arena
[0:57:29] Saint_Vallion: 5Head
[0:57:33] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: you didnt get him to 20% the first time
[0:57:33] grylz89: 1000
[0:57:34] ellgthompson: that was a gm for sure
[0:57:34] ddevillax: that was a gm tho no?
[0:57:34] oxzide92: the items names sound interesting, Hemostasis and frozen blood. if he drinks your blood than that could be it
[0:57:34] SlapdickWoWplayer: and you did that without bloods due to being opted out
[0:57:35] manbearpigereeno: that was the gm for sure
[0:57:35] Bronloch: YES YES YES
[0:57:36] Zownos: yuuuup
[0:57:37] Mico027: wasnt that the GM doing?
[0:57:38] McNerdSauce: put him in the arena
[0:57:38] PROPANIAC: Pog
[0:57:38] youwiththefeds: The npc might be part of it ngl
[0:57:38] 13brill: YES
[0:57:38] gusbillat: No bro we did that
[0:57:39] Vero8766: I think the GM did something to bring him to 50%
[0:57:39] bryn_dee: Aggrends tweet hint: Blood for the Blood Loa... What if instead of killing the boss, we are supposed to be turning in a shitakki amount of blood on the altar nearest him and then he becomes friendly and gives a reward??
[0:57:39] abugslife: YES YES YES
[0:57:40] kswissbaby: wasn‚Äôt that the GM
[0:57:41] 22nobody2: drag him when he's on 35%
[0:57:42] 13brill: ARENA FIGHT
[0:57:43] 22nobody2: xD
[0:57:43] ggmage60: maybe move it after 20%
[0:57:43] MrChaynes: thats what i was saying! take it to the gurubashi!
[0:57:43] cookie_jayy: that was also a GM
[0:57:45] jbeemerks: that altar looks bigger?
[0:57:45] JukeboxHey: Bring him into the gurubashi ARENA!!!!
[0:57:45] McNerdSauce: for all to watch
[0:57:46] ellgthompson: the gm did that to troll you
[0:57:46] foraReggy: cause its a fight
[0:57:46] Saint_Vallion: for a free for all
[0:57:48] DrJamesBuchamomile: so dymb
[0:57:48] maximo469: the GM hit him bro
[0:57:49] bojack359: What's the lumber you can buy from the vendor for?
[0:57:49] ddevillax: what if that was gm
[0:57:49] Jehl703: Because its blizzard.
[0:57:50] hollywoodxJ: ITS A PVP event
[0:57:51] omnipresentbe1ng: arena is best for dps btw
[0:57:51] ivo_nl_84: That is the ultimate pvp spot
[0:57:53] BeansAnToast: kill him in the arena its a fact :P
[0:57:53] Zownos: BLOOD FOR BLOOD BRUH @Xaryu
[0:57:53] zen0vae: kill him in the arena bro
[0:57:54] SnakeCodes: huh
[0:57:55] chrondor: Because the Arena is an altar of BLOOD
[0:57:55] Helyraa: They've done something like that before
[0:57:55] biingb0ng: It's blizzard
[0:57:55] TheCraigJr: YOJAMBA ISLAND
[0:57:55] saintfrancis: to trigger the new arena chest ffa
[0:57:56] legendarism: that was a gm messing up the hp @Xaryu
[0:57:57] YorkieKilla: get loads of people sitting in the stands
[0:57:57] Envoy04: i think thats it
[0:57:57] jujujay_myalias: Has anyone rewatched the blizzcon announcement? I feel like she was hinting a lot in nthat speech
[0:57:57] Granteater4: Season is all about blood. Having to do it in the arena would make sense
[0:57:57] shadowvypers: people would lose bloods walking past loa
[0:57:57] packtar: and the first attempt you had no bloods for first phase
[0:57:58] TobyNova: nevermind then
[0:57:58] saprelec: blizzard doesnt make sense :D
[0:57:59] gnated: yeah
[0:57:59] Domatonetv: blood for the blood god
[0:58:00] Bojanglez: @xaryu remember the bloodmoon punsihes people in a raid
[0:58:00] gindua: because its the loa and the arena is fight to the death @Xaryu
[0:58:00] gnated: it is
[0:58:02] BeansAnToast: as all the loha apear at 1%
[0:58:03] ggmage60: Move it at 21% here
[0:58:03] saintfrancis: and inside chest is the mount
[0:58:04] damnitdann1: morning dad
[0:58:05] Jehl703: @Xaryu  Blizzard always does dumb stuff
[0:58:06] KosmicDevil_: doesnt hurt to try
[0:58:06] probeu: 20% at each altar, world tour
[0:58:06] WhudaFxUp: STV is already turned into a FFA during the event, you dorks. Arena doesn't make it FFA. Lol
[0:58:07] shadowstorm_sod: Makes the arena not a worthless area
[0:58:07] conradical93: its for the RP
[0:58:08] jstuwie: THE AREANA IS A BLOOD SPILT PLAC
[0:58:09] hearingblockchain: try bringing to arena with bloods this time
[0:58:10] mackearns: cause its pretty fucking cool
[0:58:11] TodBobertson: DID I MISS REACTS?! =*(
[0:58:12] taylorsdank: @bryn_dee @Xaryu
[0:58:13] zaguidar92: The Arena is the MAIN EVENT of stv.... makes more sense then the island
[0:58:13] theartisanmtga: Can you explain how it works with the blood please?
[0:58:13] iPlayCuzFun: make boss die fighting for chest like the rest of us
[0:58:13] largist_: arena is quite central location so it would be most reasonable place for kite
[0:58:14] theclusher: @Xaryu maybe the place when GM tried to Taunt him
[0:58:15] cykoblast: cause the vendor is there
[0:58:15] zen0vae: middle of arena
[0:58:17] Retz1t: Dont expect too much from blizzard....
[0:58:17] MrChaynes: it actually makes the most sense if they are wanting people in the middle of a FFA to take him to the designated FFA spot
[0:58:18] knifeparty818: doesnt make sense cause sometimes he already spawns in arena.
[0:58:18] bottis96: is arena in middle of all spawn points???
[0:58:19] Niffah: Go swimming with him and drown him Kappa
[0:58:20] jbeemerks: no groups. all solo to kill it
[0:58:21] shadwarform: Xar the boss has 67m now, not 3M ..how would u kill it?
[0:58:22] Rumseyrum04: dragging boss around doesn‚Äôt make sense at all
[0:58:23] gnated: If he spawns at zg you would have to pull him all the way no shot
[0:58:24] WheezyFbaby_: maybe to kill boss just crash the server again and have a GM kill it for you
[0:58:25] mundanesickle: @Xaryu Feeding the boss players with debuffs from consumes would make sense. You can see him feasting on bodies during events when he kills. Maybe its a poisoned sacrifice mechanic.
[0:58:27] Knocktoff: @bryn_dee no way that is not a joke though
[0:58:27] gh00775: his health went down in perfect increments that first time! it was GM auto attack
[0:58:27] cykoblast: tha npc name is blood changer
[0:58:29] Seronem0: After all, the event is time-linked to the Gurubashi Arena Event
[0:58:29] Saint_Vallion: fake news
[0:58:29] packtar: EU cooped  with horde and ally on Guzu attempt
[0:58:29] realandtruephobe: We tried it last night with staysafe
[0:58:30] taylorsdank: aggrands tweet suggests that its a blood offering @Xaryu
[0:58:32] Amoxychillen: no... seem like a cool thing to test
[0:58:33] trapt6rr: out of all the theories that does make the most sense. why else did he get chunked.. makes sense with the crazy amount of HP he gets @xaryu
[0:58:33] realandtruephobe: made no difference
[0:58:34] Reinert7284: trust but verify
[0:58:35] infuze27: cuz blizzard is dumb lol
[0:58:36] Kritisk: Considering he has different spawn points north/middle/south kinda eliminates kiting-theories @Xaryu
[0:58:36] SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME: those people are blizzard spies trying to spread disinformation
[0:58:36] TobyNova: What are your thoughts on the Wowhead post?
[0:58:39] Saturos47: that happens regularly by accident
[0:58:39] f4a_tony: i dont think it has to do anything with "bring him to this specific place" since his spawnpoints are random
[0:58:39] PROPANIAC: wasnt the gm taking him to the altar yesterday to show that wouldnt help
[0:58:41] cory_lockman: It's a pvp event not a pve event
[0:58:41] chrondor: Cleanse blood at altar in arena with him on top during enrage phase 2
[0:58:43] SlapdickWoWplayer: wouldn't he have lost a bunch of health in some of these events already? he is around altars a lot
[0:58:43] BPmana: you have to go into his stomach and weaken his tentacles
[0:58:45] bryn_dee: @taylorsdank lol trying so hard to get him to see that but idk maybe i am memeing
[0:58:47] moka_master: still think it has something to do with the little blurb the gm said "the blood loa accepts your offerings"
[0:58:48] letholdis: something like that more then one person needs ot "try" yu know
[0:58:48] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: it looked like the boss lost something on his buff/debuff bar when he touched the altar yesterday
[0:58:49] drdoomkinx: what if you grouped in a raid with the event disabled?
[0:58:49] taylorsdank: @Xaryu aggrens tweet hints that its a blood offering
[0:58:50] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: Epicureans > Stoics
[0:58:54] Trajic: @chat what was the point of hanging on to blood?
[0:58:55] th3hilk: isn‚Äôt that what the first GM did?
[0:58:57] SuperLost89: @Xaryu you are turning in the bloods at the wrong time. you should wait for a certain quote he says
[0:58:58] gnated: yeah
[0:58:58] realandtruephobe: I don't think there is a second mechanic. What if it is straight up brute force the 13.4m down
[0:59:00] itzdcast: Some GM Is punching the air right now at their idea of kiting the boss to arena and xar calling it dumb
[0:59:01] cutexlol_: why would turning blood in kill it when its a offer to the blood loa LUL "heres my offer mighty god - pls die"
[0:59:01] TigertheFox: any idea what race/class you are playing for self found?
[0:59:03] Steiny1784: what about turn on blood when his health jumps up at 20%?
[0:59:05] realandtruephobe: We tried it last night!
[0:59:05] hutchyy917: he wasnt at 20% when he got chunked
[0:59:05] ZombieQueenElizabeth: What is the highest stack of bruised someone has had?
[0:59:08] realandtruephobe: it didnt work!
[0:59:09] mudkip4me: @Trajic he doesnt heal when he kills someone
[0:59:09] SurianSkyborn: It would have happened in our kill
[0:59:11] Astralthundr: how are you going to get into the arena with blood?
[0:59:12] taylorsdank: YES
[0:59:14] MightyCactus1: @Xaryu it does not make sense that making offerings to the blood god would do would make him easier to kill. The blood god is his patron and source of power
[0:59:15] BadGerbilLion: You guys already tried dragging him to the altar, and people accidentally lost bloods
[0:59:16] JEM_GG: then he heals to 100% lol
[0:59:16] A1K_GAMING: didnt the GM kinda pull the boss towards altar?
[0:59:18] CuppaCoffeh: but if you turn in the bloods and wrong he heals
[0:59:20] Astralthundr: you have to run past the altar
[0:59:21] ellgthompson: does he stop healing at 20%
[0:59:21] bryn_dee: @Xaryu Aggrends tweet hint: Blood for the Blood Loa... What if instead of killing the boss, we are supposed to be turning in a shitakki amount of blood on the altar nearest him and then he becomes friendly and gives a reward??
[0:59:24] damnitdann1: he was at 20% when he jumped to 13 milly
[0:59:26] StaysafeTV: we did that last night at NW altar, but not the Gurubashi altar, maybe thats different
[0:59:27] letholdis: if no one knows what the bruised debuff is it def relates to that no? @Xaryu
[0:59:29] iPlayCuzFun: maybe a shaman has to purify him at 20% idno
[0:59:30] whiteiceog: one of the first leaks about P2, talked about this PvP event and how after the event it would spawn a boss in the arena. could be an accidental leak on method to kill
[0:59:30] gindua: because its the loa and the arena is fight to the death @Xaryu
[0:59:32] th3hilk: blood count that matches his ear count?
[0:59:33] realandtruephobe: We all drgaged him to altar at 20% and return bloods, made no diff
[0:59:36] blowoutsale: blizzard didnt add any mechanics to the boss cause he was never designed to be killed
[0:59:37] jahslim: @Xaryu Horde got the boss to around 20% last night couldn't get him lower
[0:59:39] dbddbddb: fight the shaman in the arena pls
[0:59:45] gooshmagic12: om D:
[0:59:48] eyeoin: people just lying about what they've tried
[0:59:48] FrostsWorld: We tried it but we had very low blood to turn in when he was around the alter and WAY less people
[0:59:52] CuppaCoffeh: That GM mentioned something about sacrifice
[0:59:58] zen0vae: has to do with bloods
[0:59:58] TodBobertson: DID I MISS REACTS?!
[1:00:00] damnitdann1: Guzu tried this morning you could ask him how it went
[1:00:03] realandtruephobe: No, oddly enough he didn't
[1:00:05] manbearpigereeno: i don't think there's any healing once he reaches below 20 tho, that shoudn't mater
[1:00:12] Imboz: SMOrc
[1:00:14] realandtruephobe: I guess there were lots of players with bloods still?
[1:00:22] Saint_Vallion: you are done buddy
[1:00:23] chrondor: no arcane intellect
[1:00:23] MikeTysonsCocaineBear: have all range dps stack and kite around the arena in a circle with hunters using aspect of the pact. melee dps will have to just have to stay away from the boss and stop greifers
[1:00:25] KetsuN: What if it's the opposite:  the more blood turned in the stronger be becomes since his god is his power and you're making the god stronger?  Just never turn in blood and have more blood on you without turning it in
[1:00:28] bpwryl: yesterday when you dragged him to the altar he healed back up to 20% from 16% or whatever
[1:00:28] Nezzy243: LMFAO
[1:00:29] xlineagefreek: kek
[1:00:30] rollinsthechamp: AHAHAHAHA

[1:02:45] Adams142: why would they make a boss where 300+ people need to be there to kill it? makes no sense
[1:02:47] heyimtazz: it cant be that damage is impossible
[1:02:48] Ditz1003: 1
[1:02:48] maniiieelll: maybe that boss was not meant to die at lvl 40
[1:02:48] Gardeos: isnt the buff of STV Says only party or raid ? so it's a thing to kill the boss

[1:02:55] Gardeos: cause there's no point of making raid on this event
[1:02:56] oxzide92: If that was the way, i dont think gms would have messed with the HP so freely
[1:02:57] cory_lockman: no it aint lol

[1:03:12] twisted_127: what if boss isn‚Äôt suposta be killed and bliz added a p2 last min the stop u guys

[1:03:22] lHlUlLlK: what was the exact message the GM sent yesterday?
[1:03:23] zen0vae: had WB lmao
[1:03:24] synos___: macro for decoy totem
[1:03:24] kswissbaby: shamans are easy once you know how they play
[1:03:25] mental95: killing decoy totem doesnt remove the freedom
[1:03:26] grylz89: @xaryu You literally need the whole server to burn through the last 13 mil being your on a timer
[1:03:26] Gardeos: isnt the buff of STV Says only party or raid ? so it's a thing to kill the boss
[1:03:27] Peschke9: whats the totem do?
[1:03:30] Soulmangos: killing decoy totem doesnt remove freedom
[1:03:30] blazzedzz: He needs to kill less people prior to 20% so he gains less hp??
[1:03:31] bvndxg_joe: @Xaryu hardest class to 1v1?
[1:03:32] trapt6rr: @xaryu I think bringing him to arena at 20% makes the most sense, why else did he get chunked, that has to be the way to kill him, whatever it was that made his HP get smashed is what you need right..
[1:03:33] cory_lockman: killing totem does nothing freedom stays on
[1:03:35] boblewis13: killing decoy doesnt remove freedom
[1:03:36] Saint_Vallion: what about elemental shaman
[1:03:38] boblewis13: its seperate
[1:03:42] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu look at the buring warlock on the gorund, maybe that cuased massive damage yesterday
[1:03:43] GotLuck: @Xaryu looks like a little hint here https://x.com/AggrendWoW/status/1762914154250424598?s=20
[1:03:45] Soulmangos: the totem just absorbs one melee attack
[1:03:46] nyjahwow: lmao shaman is BOT
[1:03:47] ravedbear: the only other mechanic that would maybe make sense is if there‚Äôs a way to taint your blood to prevent the boss from healing. Like Hakkar in ZG
[1:03:47] Minotaurius: druid
[1:03:47] knifeparty818: its forsure just a DPS race it doesnt make sense to have a mechanic for a boss in a PvP zone that takes both factions to kill. @Xaryu
[1:03:48] baldanduseless: bm hunter Kappa
[1:03:50] hajanatorator: warlock?
[1:03:52] nyjahwow: mage no change against shaman
[1:03:53] manbearpigereeno: ele shaman is disgusting vs mage

[1:03:56] zen0vae: dueling warlock hard?
[1:03:56] ShingaTV: demo lock :) (not meta)
[1:04:00] BeansAnToast: do you not struggle with rogues at all xar?
[1:04:00] LeggomyEggoNow: Druid
[1:04:02] WaDaFruCK: killing the totem doesn't remove the freedom; its just a 10 second freedom. The decoy totem itself just eats 1 melee attack, and is separate from the freedom effect.
[1:04:03] Vossytronix: Yes
[1:04:04] grylz89: @xaryu You literally need the whole server to burn through the last 13 mil being your on a timer
[1:04:04] idiotferaltko: feral druid give mage problem?
[1:04:06] twisted_127: what if Bliz make moss not to be killed and GM added P2 last min to stop ya guys

[1:04:07] Timmyjk: @Saint_Vallion mage win easily
[1:04:07] Bronloch: Ret is really scary LUL LUL
[1:04:08] cory_lockman: decoy totem buff stays on shammy even after it's death
[1:04:09] BeansAnToast: or just scripted
[1:04:09] Fl1ntBeastw00d: damn its so hard to find mages to do the chrono rune with
[1:04:11] zen0vae: as a rogue i eat mages
[1:04:11] taylorsdank: no chance its not a mechanic
[1:04:13] McNerdSauce: guzu got him low
[1:04:14] Big_Zum: kind of sad dueling tournament was canceled @xaryu
[1:04:16] YzieGG: then why would the hp go up at all
[1:04:19] h00lio23: ya
[1:04:22] SpaceCowboy0811: idk thats alot of HP
[1:04:23] dafiddle: ye

[1:04:27] Saint_Vallion: @Timmyjk PepoG
[1:04:27] dashxoxo: Thoughts on chance of MoP classic after cata?
[1:04:28] cory_lockman: you pressed CoC and it didn't slow him
[1:04:29] Guenhyvar_: totem just eats one melee
[1:04:29] taylorsdank: they wouldnt leave it up to a streamer to need to get hundreds of players its gotta be a mechanic @Xaryu
[1:04:29] curedubs: @xaryu i think its yojamba because all the altars look like the yojamba altar except yojamba is just a bigger version and it DOESNT have an altar to turn in bloods
[1:04:30] ChiCity312: just get his HP to 0
[1:04:31] Synthez542: In savix's words, it's just the burn phase from 15 million
[1:04:31] idiotferaltko: feral druid hard for mage?
[1:04:32] JaniRockz: @Xaryu hp of enemy in classic is not clear, it was just a visual bug that his HP increased IMO
[1:04:33] Zownos: @Xaryu hold on, go look at the loa alter and see if there are any specific designs on them that stick out
[1:04:34] HelluvaWrecks: its definitely a mechanic
[1:04:35] oiseaubluoi: @zen0vae a good mage 100% rogues,
[1:04:35] bojack359: What spec do you play for raid?
[1:04:35] youwiththefeds: You have a 10sec window to kill me, its a 20sec cd
[1:04:37] Tal_NeonFlame: mages have too many downsides atm
[1:04:37] Boopermans: just block the freedom then ig
[1:04:37] winsong: the totem is just the melee attack absorb thing it does
[1:04:40] Suva_13: The Altar of Zanza in yojamba isle has this text, might be something idk?We call upon you, Zanza of Zuldazar.  Bless those that ask for your help, Loa Zanza. Bless those that would ally with the Zandalarian people.  Aid us in this time of need. Aid us Loa. Give us the power to strike down our enemies. Give us the power to once more defeat the Blood God.
[1:04:41] sickal: think he gains health at 20% based off how many ears he has
[1:04:42] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu Come look at this buring warlock on the ground here
[1:04:43] ninetysix: no way its zug zug, 13 mill is too much for zug zug
[1:04:44] Jehl703: @Xaryu Read the lore behind Loa. Theyre all about offerings. Get boss to phase 2 and offer enough blood to turn him friendly and talk to him for reward. GG
[1:04:46] ShingaTV: also true^^
[1:04:46] Vossytronix: Yooo
[1:04:49] gregfork: What if the HP buff is just a failsafe because they DON'T want you to kill the boss?
[1:04:50] zaguidar92: and server crash
[1:04:51] DrSkittles: His health doesn't move after 20%, there's not "bursting him down" from this point until whatever immunity is removed.
[1:04:51] laxxe12: My twich prime is bugged @Xaryu god damnit would've used it on u but it wont let me!!
[1:04:54] Kickproof: It's possible he's just not meant to die.
[1:04:55] Frizankbeast: Stop overthinking it LUL
[1:04:55] lHlUlLlK: over 500
[1:04:55] twisted_127: not killable
[1:04:57] xlineagefreek: yea that cant be it
[1:04:58] M0rley_: @StaysafeTV Will you be forming a group in an hour or so?
[1:05:01] Unfragged: mana drain him?
[1:05:02] qc3rs: its 100% a mechanic, there's gotta be a clue GMs left behind when they showed up
[1:05:03] JaniRockz: @Xaryu hp of enemy in classic is not clear, it was just a visual bug that his HP increased IMO-
[1:05:03] sizzler1900: too much laf
[1:05:03] AsiansFirst: are you streaming late for SF today?
[1:05:03] SpaceCowboy0811: does his HP scale on tags? @Xaryu
[1:05:04] puzuga: could be intended for higher level
[1:05:05] monoboxtv: I did 10 DPS tho
[1:05:05] bloodsnaill: 3.2million hp
[1:05:05] Malfunked38: lag
[1:05:05] oxzide92: Anyone tried fishing anything new in the STV fishing event for something to use during the event?
[1:05:05] meatnmilk: Need mnore HUnters
[1:05:08] Saint_Vallion: also he was getting some % hback
[1:05:08] hdvision0803: the dcs
[1:05:09] sickal: @xaryu think he gains health at 20% based off how many ears he has
[1:05:10] GIenQuagmire613: my hc char died last night to that shit
[1:05:10] dashxoxo: Thoughts on chance of MoP classic after cata? Û†ÄÄ
[1:05:11] aNastyNate: could the answer just be its not meant to be killable? seems its being overthought
[1:05:11] cutexlol_: most of the raid had like 20 dps LUL
[1:05:11] MightyCactus1: Or he honestly might not be intended to be killable
[1:05:11] Diddly_dope: gotta offer him bloods at the end
[1:05:12] mundanesickle: @DrSkittles Wrong.
[1:05:12] rollinsthechamp: MORE STABLE SERVERS AND BLIZZARD HAHAHAHA
[1:05:13] GIenQuagmire613: kek
[1:05:13] shadwarform: Xar let me duel u with my shaman enchanc
[1:05:14] aSteamedTomato: @Xaryu inb4 it's bait to stress test new tech
[1:05:15] avo_9: Why would they have the boss HP increase at 20% if it was just supposed to be DPS'd down
[1:05:15] PaxedUP: are we sure killing the boss isnt a part of phase 3 or 4?
[1:05:15] Saint_Vallion: KEKW
[1:05:16] EnvironNA: Remember when blizzard said "if you make a raid group you will be punished"  where was  the punishment?
[1:05:16] xkrayjinx: I don't think it was meant to be killed this phase.
[1:05:17] Eggzactly54: server crashing was a massive debuff
[1:05:18] meatnmilk: need 500 hunters to kill boss
[1:05:19] Saint_Vallion: SHAMELESS AINTNOWAY
[1:05:22] Spikeqc: yo xarbar whats good ok
[1:05:22] Meanpandah: 500*50dps
[1:05:23] Zownos: @Xaryu hold on, go look at the loa alter and see if there are any specific designs on them that stick out
[1:05:26] hearingblockchain: server crashed nonstop
[1:05:26] ddevillax: if u twitch prime u do 50% more damage to boss
[1:05:27] zaguidar92: maybe streams are part of killing him
[1:05:27] Plaguethong: You are not supposed to kill the boss
[1:05:29] gregfork: Why are we assuming that the boss is supposed to be killed? Maybe they don't want it to die.
[1:05:29] zen0vae: 500 players doing 5 dps each
[1:05:30] radicalvlad: !ssf
[1:05:32] criowa: at lot of dps was lost with the disconnects
[1:05:35] cyond: Is there anything you can do in Spirit form if you get killed when he is at 20%
[1:05:35] eyonixz: he was never suppose to be killed when he nearly died the GM turned up the HP to stop you. its really that simple
[1:05:36] trikkle4153: server crashing layered my group at 90% so we were left watching stream
[1:05:38] GotLuck: looks like a little hint here https://x.com/AggrendWoW/status/1762914154250424598?s=20
[1:05:39] Plaz_a: @Xaryu flip the boss his name maybe its a hint xd
[1:05:39] yung_jed: 500 ppl and 200 of them mages aoe farming
[1:05:39] Saint_Vallion: if you twitch prime u will get a free boost in soD
[1:05:42] zaguidar92: SoD
[1:05:42] shenon24: shenon24 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:05:44] Malfunked38: orc is ready to zugzug
[1:05:44] cutexlol_: does it work on yourself if its "ally"?
[1:05:45] bryn_dee: It is not supposed to be killed..  maybe? what if instead of damaging him.. we are to offer him blood sacrifice at the nearest altar to him and he becomes an ally and rewards us?
[1:05:45] mageguy8: without lag you might be able to elisBall if you math it out you don't need that many people over 30 minutes @Xaryu
[1:05:47] KetsuN: What if it's the opposite:  the more blood turned in the stronger be becomes since his god is his power and you're making the god stronger?  Just never turn in blood and have more blood on you without turning it in
[1:05:54] kswissbaby: maybe you have to have 10k concurrent viewers while you kill him
[1:05:54] zaguidar92: sod is still in beta
[1:05:55] chrondor: Drink up boys; water for the water god!
[1:05:59] aSteamedTomato: I think it's a tech stress test
[1:05:59] shenon24: xarDing
[1:06:00] JEM_GG: I just assumed they made him impossible

[1:06:03] Saint_Vallion: monkaW
[1:06:03] curv6: they did a quick reset this morning maybe they nerfed it?
[1:06:04] Nekator: it's called season of discovery. why wouldnt there be more to it?
[1:06:05] bloodsnaill: he heals 10% on each kill don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible
[1:06:07] Sqwibbie: @Xaryu Maybe there is a mechanic but maybe you can bypass that with 600 people lol
[1:06:08] zen0vae: im going to be so hyped when yall figure this out
[1:06:09] JEM_GG: lmaoooo

[1:06:21] PaxedUP: couldnt he purge the iceblock anyways?
[1:06:23] twisted_127: ^^^^ twiter link
[1:06:23] SpaceCowboy0811: is that the Ulda pickaxe?
[1:06:24] Saint_Vallion: BRO GOT BONKED BY THOR ORCISH AINTNOWAY
[1:06:25] curedubs: @xaryu i think its yojamba because all the altars look like the yojamba altar except yojamba is just a bigger version and it DOESNT have an altar to turn in bloods Û†ÄÄ
[1:06:25] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu the boss has equivlent to some bosses in naxx 4..maybe even more
[1:06:25] CuppaCoffeh: hit him with holy water
[1:06:25] Plaz_a: @Xaryu flip the boss his name maybe its a hint xd Û†ÄÄ
[1:06:27] eyonixz: he was never suppose to be killed when he nearly died the GM turned up the HP to stop you. its really that simple  Û†ÄÄ
[1:06:28] Deatharmor98: I watched an Enhance beat Guzu while the Enhance was disarmed LMAO
[1:06:28] drdoomkinx: gotta release to get rezed
[1:06:29] encrypteddeath: Xaryu you have to release
[1:06:31] thuglynx: SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:06:32] theclusher: @Xaryu maybe something related to lore ? Hakkar the soulflayer
[1:06:34] dashxoxo: Thoughts on chance of MoP classic after cata? Fav xpac for sure
[1:06:34] aSteamedTomato: could they be trying to tune the layering and lag handling
[1:06:35] jemzy91: no just invite them to
[1:06:35] unsteddy: Maybe we need a prime sub for each ear the boss has?
[1:06:35] voltrox1909: Maybe something super difficult is good content and prevents people from saying "there's nothing to do" after doing everything in 3 days.
[1:06:36] jemzy91: a grp
[1:06:36] kswissbaby: surely enhance needed the spirit of the alpha buff
[1:06:38] Astralthundr: cant purge iceblock
[1:06:39] zaguidar92: shammy just there to kill Xar. lets others rez. EPIC
[1:06:40] Oogiman: @Xaryu DOES ANYONE HAVE THE GNOMER GLASSES? MAYBE WE CAN SEE HIDDEN THINGS WITH THEM?????
[1:06:44] EnvironNA: its  c ause you arent in party so can only res when your dead
[1:06:45] Plaz_a: @Xaryu flip the boss his name maybe its a hint xd
[1:06:46] knifeparty818: It doesnt make sense to have a boss that needs a mechanic in a warzone.
[1:06:47] realandtruephobe: Staysafe went to the hakkar tablet last night
[1:06:50] youwiththefeds: @kswissbaby does nothing for pvp but go off queen
[1:06:52] ozewill: kite him to zg
[1:06:52] realandtruephobe: couldn't find anything
[1:06:53] blazzedzz: Is there a coalition between his trophy and gaining hp at 20%????
[1:06:55] Oogiman: @Xaryu DOES ANYONE HAVE THE GNOMER GLASSES? MAYBE WE CAN SEE HIDDEN THINGS WITH THEM????? ANYONE??
[1:06:55] Saint_Vallion: Clueless
[1:07:00] twisted_127: jook at greenfields tweet
[1:07:00] Hellacat: his archeology skill isnt high enough to be deciphering runes on ancient troll altars
[1:07:00] cryptoraven2: Drag him to ZG?
[1:07:03] daveinspace_: maybe u need priests to mind flay him lol
[1:07:03] mrthundercatx: decoy is 20 second cooldown lol
[1:07:05] WaDaFruCK: decoy totem is 20s cd
[1:07:09] tromic: decoy has 50% uptime
[1:07:10] Wolfieallen: decoy totem has 20s cd
[1:07:10] yami_yugi_87: the lore on the tablet says Zanza aid us in killing blood god
[1:07:10] Vocox23: 5Head
[1:07:12] zen0vae: maybe it matters which alter he is at
[1:07:12] cutexlol_: imagine its something crazy like you have to fight him in ghost form LUL
[1:07:12] Plaz_a: @Xaryu flip the boss his name maybe its a hint xd Û†ÄÄ

[1:07:16] twisted_127: look at greenfields from bliz tweet
[1:07:17] Peschke9: you can't break the decoy totem?
[1:07:18] Deatharmor98: It LASTS 10 sec yall dense
[1:07:20] Oogiman: @Xaryu DOES ANYONE HAVE THE GNOMER GLASSES? MAYBE WE CAN SEE HIDDEN THINGS WITH THEM????? MAYBE?
[1:07:20] SUPEROBNOXIOUSALLCAPSNAME: COPIUM
[1:07:20] mrthundercatx: LUL right
[1:07:21] rx_maryj: how are you
[1:07:21] Tanov96: @Xaryu the epic goggles from last boss in gnomer?
[1:07:23] ripwarlock2: can just outrange them
[1:07:26] Big_Zum: @xaryu can u not polymorph agreeing killing decoy
[1:07:27] bpwryl: Yesterday you would‚Äôve needed 170 ppl doing 100 dps to kill him on time, should be possible without disconnects
[1:07:27] curv6: no
[1:07:27] thebigdongerhere: He wont
[1:07:29] brianbiceps2: When do u go for the boss?
[1:07:32] Big_Zum: after killing
[1:07:35] starp1rate: i think we all have so little to do in phase 2 that we are making up our own content now
[1:07:37] shothos: maybe he needs to be killed with love and positivity
[1:07:38] oxzide92: perhaps the boss healed so much yesterday because it targeted an "Unkillable" gm, and that was able to let him get some sweaty heals off
[1:07:38] curedubs: @Xaryu going to see if yojamba elites stay during bloodmoon will report to you
[1:07:39] iPlayCuzFun: i honestly the GM came and buffed boss HP yesterday because they dont want it to be killed
[1:07:39] boohtyy: @Xaryu what time are we killing bloodmoon boss?
[1:07:39] Lucons1: change trinket
[1:07:40] Diddly_dope: gnomer trinket that makes u big then sacrifice to him lol
[1:07:41] megabytez_: what exactly is decoy totem doing?
[1:07:46] Lupsx: What if u just can't kill it?
[1:07:48] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He actually attacks people while they're dead
[1:07:51] Jointmike: @starp1rate full delusion thinking the boss is meant to be killed lmao
[1:07:51] Oogiman: @Xaryu DOES ANYONE HAVE THE GNOMER GLASSES? MAYBE WE CAN SEE HIDDEN THINGS WITH THEM?????
[1:07:52] icyhawtt: @xaryu look at greenfelds twitter banner its in there
[1:07:54] Saturos47: can i link a youtube
[1:07:56] Trajic: @Xaryu what if the boss takes reduced damage because people have blood on them?
[1:07:57] bryn_dee: He is talking about blood for blood loa tweet
[1:07:58] uacole: @xaryu arcane surge build for the 1v1 tourney gonna win?
[1:07:58] bloodsnaill: you have to enter sunken temple but outside instance and find the altar to Hakkas which has a heart that is the bosses heart using it makes him more vulnerable
[1:08:00] Big_Zum: yeah I see
[1:08:00] Tanov96: @Xaryu the epic goggles from last boss in gnomer? Û†ÄÄ
[1:08:00] dashxoxo: Thoughts on chance of MoP classic after cata?
[1:08:04] dae_bed: fake the poly and burn ground
[1:08:06] baldanduseless: @Xaryu earth shock is melee range most of the time now
[1:08:06] Odezq: @Xaryu pretty sure blood boss drops 1 gold token, so its mount for everyone attempting him
[1:08:06] TodBobertson: @Xaryu Has anyone confirmed the buff that GM had was a GM buff, and not a buff granted from some combat mechanic in the fight?
[1:08:09] zen0vae: earth shock is short range
[1:08:11] dbddbddb: is it worth taking ice lance to kill totems quickly
[1:08:11] Lucons1: change trinket yt
[1:08:12] mostlikelyyadad: whats up @xaryu how we doing today
[1:08:13] KetsuN: What if it's the opposite:  the more blood turned in the stronger be becomes since his god is his power and you're making the god stronger?  Just never turn in blood and have more blood on you without turning it in
[1:08:14] zaguidar92: Silence into sheep
[1:08:15] Oogiman: @Xaryu DOES ANYONE HAVE THE GNOMER GLASSES? MAYBE WE CAN SEE HIDDEN THINGS WITH THEM????? maybe??
[1:08:16] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu Do you think this warlock on the ground has something to do with his health droping yesterday
[1:08:16] TylerTan213: hes playing way of earth so he can only earth shock in melee range @xaryu
[1:08:19] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He actually attacks people while they're dead
[1:08:22] Big_Zum: after he uses frost shock blink poly?
[1:08:24] skeppebus: Yo Xar, wasnt the blood god created just as a punishment for raidgroups? not to be killed. Just a thought
[1:08:24] booddhi: @Xaryu he might have been healing because you opted out
[1:08:25] juice42069: maybe u have to turn in bloods at 20%
[1:08:25] bryn_dee: @TodBobertson yes because the toon had GM robes on too
[1:08:26] NutterCircus: A good sham is a pain in the butt fr
[1:08:28] SmashTheDude: @Xaryu have people fight fist to get max blood then engage boss without turnning in blood
[1:08:29] wrefos: @Xaryu If you get boss to 20% with 20 minutes remaining, you need ~12000 dps (ignoring healing) which feels like a mangable amount without server issues/griefing?
[1:08:29] realandtruephobe: IT's kinda cool we figured that part out. Definitely need blood to get him to 20%
[1:08:29] Big_Zum: while earth shock on cd
[1:08:29] swidey221: @xaryu people need to die on the altar at 20%, he shouts he wants ‚Äúblood and souls‚Äù, first 80% he gets blood, last 20% he gets souls. he also says the altars will have skulls
[1:08:30] starp1rate: @Jointmike i think i t would be cool if the boss was meant to be killed, but it doesnt look like it is
[1:08:30] dramajohns: earth shock is mellee range, they always run way of earth rune @Xaryu
[1:08:32] Atomblade: @Xaryu  where is actually mitch=?
[1:08:33] sengip: I truly think it was a big, 21% isn't a point a phase would start.
[1:08:35] baldanduseless: they run a rune that makes earthshock mele range @Xaryu
[1:08:35] zen0vae: earth shock range only like 15 yards
[1:08:35] icyhawtt: @Xaryu check greenfelds twitter banner the answer is in there!
[1:08:36] Odezq: @Xaryu for sure blood boss drops 1 gold token so basicly mount for everyone
[1:08:36] Amoxychillen: What if we are giving blizz too much cred and they are hastily trying to add a mechanic and loot to the boss whilst saying... "yess yessss we totally envisioned having to do this much work"
[1:08:37] SmashTheDude: @Xaryu basically starving the boss of blood
[1:08:38] Tbiz87: what if more blood means more damage like a buff somehow
[1:08:38] TheAshkandi: whats the bosses name again
[1:08:41] ShingaTV: he didnt heal much under 20% even without bloods
[1:08:44] booddhi: @Xaryu he might have been healing because you opted out .
[1:08:45] sengip: I truly think it was a bug, 21% isn't a point a phase would start. @Xaryu
[1:08:50] Kazunya_Meowryu: thats a lie lol
[1:08:51] Jointmike: @starp1rate yeah the healing the boss gets just makes it unkillable
[1:08:52] dankks31: xar where‚Äôs Mitch at ? call him
[1:08:55] ryan___mcg: xarBomb xarBomb xarBomb
[1:08:55] Saturos47: @Xaryu can i link a relevant youtube
[1:08:56] TodBobertson: @bryn_dee GM robes dont mean the buff was because he is GM, and not a part of the boss fight he participated in.
[1:08:58] NutterCircus: A good sham doesnt use way of the earth for Pvp
[1:08:59] knifeparty818: i wonder how the GM got aggro yesterday because the boss targeted him.
[1:09:03] yami_yugi_87: we do not use way of earth we us sham rage
[1:09:08] Zachsy: no its not
[1:09:08] baldanduseless: yeah
[1:09:08] imvecks: no
[1:09:09] Kazunya_Meowryu: no they use shammy rage for dps
[1:09:13] yami_yugi_87: this due is way of earth and I dont know why
[1:09:14] andersgroterud94: no shamanistic rage
[1:09:14] Retz1t: Maybe Horde and Alliance needs to unite for this
[1:09:15] boblewis13: yea mostky
[1:09:15] imvecks: most run sham rage
[1:09:16] vindiee: @sengip literally says something like "the blood god goes beserk" or something at that hp
[1:09:16] bushthebug: wayt of the earth is bonus health so they prob use it
[1:09:18] ChrisAlecs: bis pvp
[1:09:19] Big_Zum: not really way of earth was good phase 1
[1:09:19] migbilkers: Only bad shams run way of the earth into casters
[1:09:19] WaDaFruCK: as a shaman main, not all of them; a good amount will though
[1:09:19] LoosieJuice: yes, even ele sham we run way of the earth for pvp
[1:09:19] joestopfarmingshako: Yes but good shaman will swap wep enhancement
[1:09:20] Saint_Vallion: KEKW
[1:09:23] LoosieJuice: free health
[1:09:23] chrondor: @TheAshkandi Amabatukha'damu
[1:09:26] Soulmangos: @yami_yugi_87 then ur playing sham wrong kekw
[1:09:27] M0rley_: I still firmly believe this is all for nothing. But you do you
[1:09:28] Astralthundr: for STV even mostly, but in a 1v1 like this i wouldnt
[1:09:28] sengip: I truly think it was a bug, 21% isn't a point a phase would start. @Xaryu
[1:09:29] starp1rate: @Jointmike and the 10 mil + health he gets at low %. i think that may be something blizzard put to make sure he doesnt get killed, because he isnt meant to
[1:09:30] Vocox23: EZ
[1:09:30] baldanduseless: in pvp most run woe for the health sham rage got nerfed
[1:09:32] kswissbaby: flawless victory
[1:09:32] grylz89: @xaryu what about stacking as many players with max blood (250) and try that? Maybe more blood the better possibly?
[1:09:33] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: 2-2!
[1:09:33] EnvironNA: you got the heal with like 0.2 left LOL
[1:09:33] Zownos: @Xaryu look for a Hummingbird on the alters with the Rayband cosmetic glasses from gnomer!!
[1:09:33] Tanov96: @Xaryu the epic goggles from last boss in gnomer?
[1:09:33] Lamira: what does the totem do
[1:09:34] iPlayCuzFun: if u toggle urself off the event can u still see boss? and would he heal on u since no bloods?

[1:11:04] Eggzactly54: you wont get people to stay away though
[1:11:04] annsiee: @Xaryu try letting the boss kill people who have high blood stacks, maybe the he takes damage the more you have

[1:11:47] chasingshadowsz: lol
[1:11:47] JaniRockz: @Xaryu hp of enemy in classic is not clear, it was just a visual bug that his HP increased IMO
[1:11:48] illlili: it would be sicker if you had roles, like proper tanks, people who kill the griefers...
[1:11:48] killawatts75: as much copium as you were on yesterday thinking 200ppl had it
[1:11:49] LeoNoComply: Xar you ever play much hearthstone?

[1:11:58] crappiefisher7: @xaryu they designed the STV event to not be done in large raid groups, maybe the same applies
[1:12:00] KosmicDevil_: try running when phase 2 starts maybe to not die iduno
[1:12:00] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead
[1:12:00] aparssss: @Xaryu maybe the play is to get the 500 ppl but NO ONE be in a raid. maybe the heal is punishment for beeing in a group.

[1:13:09] Big_Zum: @xaryu didn‚Äôt they say raids will be punished? maybe it has to be all solo parties
[1:13:11] Zerksyera: have bloods and less lagg equals BIG WIN
[1:13:12] YzieGG: but why would the hp go up at all
[1:13:15] MysoreMango: The strat is everyone needs to be dead. No one should be alive near him. You really and dps him and he gets a debuff ( no one alive can be near him for 25 seconds)
[1:13:16] xDooder: everyone bring your bag of marbles.
[1:13:17] justingatlin: The bark is smooth, olive-brown when young and silvery-grey on older branches, and features scattered broad fissures with a rougher texture.

[1:13:25] ScryerTV: ask melee to not come
[1:13:27] meekoniko: @Xaryu He was stuck at 20% until the GM pulled him to the alter correct?
[1:13:28] Velvuri: light of elune @ last part
[1:13:28] knifeparty818: @Xaryu Im telling you its forsure a DPS race. theres no way they are putting a mechanic in a PvP zone.
[1:13:29] Plaguethong: You are not ment to have 500 ppl try to kill him
[1:13:30] JonesLiveGaming: @xaryu can u have less people die with a dedicated tank with 4 healers in a group?
[1:13:31] rawlexdota: EU did it till 10%
[1:13:32] burnitdown_leon: bring kahdamu to ZG island to the big altar KomodoHype
[1:13:33] realandtruephobe: @everganaj 13% but 9m health

[1:13:36] Plaz_a: flip the boss his name maybe its a hint xd
[1:13:36] illlili: i think you want to make good groups tho. a healer in every group, tank groups with 2 tanks, 3 healers. ffa means nobody gets heals
[1:13:36] mylittlehombre: no rogues
[1:13:36] haversham29: Rig hc servers again in 1.5h

[1:13:39] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu do you think this warlock on ground has something to do with health dip here yesterday???
[1:13:40] JaniRockz: @Xaryu hp of enemy in classic is not clear, it was just a visual bug that his HP increased IMO
[1:13:46] mangocat40: make sure to call warriors to mortal strike @Xaryu
[1:13:48] Plaguethong: The boss is not for this phase but the next
[1:13:49] desweck: tbf, we're doing as much dps as naxx
[1:13:50] Griff_666: Try the world Shrinker
[1:13:50] Phrosted_: anything besides brute force is just a guess anyway
[1:13:53] ibunilol: stop stalling and duel coward
[1:13:54] shadowstorm_sod: You have to achieve wows hardest mechanic no lag
[1:13:54] realandtruephobe: Yeah collect bloods the event before

[1:13:58] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu do you think this warlock on ground has something to do with health dip here yesterday?
[1:13:59] Taxsvcs: You can always brute force and if it does not look like dmg is there turn in bloods so that you don't waste a second run trying t hat.
[1:14:01] Malfunked38: totem weapon
[1:14:02] kirk_hunts: Taste the beast!
[1:14:03] bojack359: The server crashing was a big dps loss so probably could do 8t if that doesn't happen again
[1:14:04] blazzedzz: @xaryu dose he gain less hp if he gets less trophys??
[1:14:04] abledthunder: maybe having max stack bloods lets you do more damage?
[1:14:06] realandtruephobe: @Big_Zum Yes that is what we have been doing
[1:14:07] rawlexdota: @Xaryu alot of warrior for execute

[1:14:15] cutexlol_: Thaddius has 6.6 mio. hp LUL
[1:14:15] SpaceCowboy0811: why does he collect ears? just to show how many players he killed for fun?

[1:14:19] Guenhyvar_: they nerfed the boss so that old vid does not matter

[1:14:45] rollinsthechamp: @dashxoxo Praying every day for it
[1:14:45] Goobadoobadoob: @janirockz it is with an addon plus the progress of killing the boss halted when boss hit 20%
[1:14:46] Twiz121: no stairs allowed
[1:14:46] rickehb: there must be some link between the alter and blood to get the boss down
[1:14:47] al_capow: he didnt ground or decoy rip

[1:15:46] Nasty_Gnar: !server
[1:15:47] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[1:15:48] ScryerTV: Gurubashi biggest
[1:15:48] kiffa49: bijuos turn in at an alter no?
[1:15:50] rollinsthechamp: @dashxoxo 100% played MoP P-Servers only my whole life got my LSD2 and WWLS team ready to smoke already :D
[1:15:54] Dirty8_D: YUHHH
[1:15:54] realandtruephobe: Imagine if he spawned at beach and they needed you to drag him to the island across the whole zone. That would be basically impossible
[1:15:54] IamTheBody: lets gooooo
[1:15:55] yami_yugi_87: The tablet on the island is the tip to figure it out
[1:16:00] LeoNoComply: i don't remember any altar on that island i thought it was were the gorilla rare spawned but i might be wrong
[1:16:00] AaahhRealAliens: what if when he dies, ZG opens as a 20 man raid
[1:16:00] mothelot: The island close to booty bay is the way
[1:16:01] xbabyfirefly: no way the strat is to kite him anywhere lol, normal grps or raids wouldnt be able to organise that in a single event
[1:16:03] zaguidar92: might be far fetch but sacrifice players (bring in bloods) and a gm will come help???%?
[1:16:03] ShingaTV: @chat the dead warlock inside is just for a warlock rune btw

[1:16:28] bongwaterfacewash: horde is just better
[1:16:30] YzieGG: duelling viewers KEKW
[1:16:30] huntgray17: there was a guy earlier on shobek‚Äôs stream that got banned bc he said womp womp cry about it to payo because payo said some sh!t first to him
[1:16:31] zernez_tv: nah bro ur just lagging dw
[1:16:31] SpaceCowboy0811: unless something changes on ZG island during event, its the same as usual @Xaryu
[1:16:32] cookie_jayy: lving flame is so busted holy shit
[1:16:33] BIuffwatcher: I like the idea of Hakkar helping kill this pretender.
[1:16:34] Malfunked38: nice comeback
[1:16:35] bottis96: if there is a single kite area you would think it would be center of spawn points
[1:16:35] Badbotqt: bring him next to an altar to trade ears so he doesn‚Äôt heal
[1:16:36] FatherOwens: ur so good
[1:16:36] zaguidar92: might be far fetch but sacrifice players (bring in bloods) and a gm will come help???%?
[1:16:41] InnerHarmony: Pog
[1:16:43] adam_brisbane: didnt bridella always beat you?
[1:16:43] xkrayjinx: So if you do the math you'd only need 78 people doing 100 dps for the full 30 minutes to kill the LOA boss. It's definitely doable with 250 people.
[1:16:44] migbilkers: mages having a full heal is so silly
[1:16:46] Voriq: i lagged bro ur lucky
[1:16:46] fknah: What layer are you on
[1:16:46] saund: mages are pretty much better shadow priests atm
[1:16:50] Guydx: not bad, but bad enough xarW
[1:16:53] grylz89: @shatteredlol yo it's grylz! We doing gnomer tonight?
[1:16:54] Suva_13: the yojamba isle altar has a tablet at the altar that says this We call upon you, Zanza of Zuldazar.  Bless those that ask for your help, Loa Zanza. Bless those that would ally with the Zandalarian people.  Aid us in this time of need. Aid us Loa. Give us the power to strike down our enemies. Give us the power to once more defeat the Blood God.
[1:16:54] mothelot: The island close to Booty Bay got some elite boss and a weird altar. Maybe unrelated tho @Xaryu
[1:16:54] PunkhoodTV: he didnt dispel :P
[1:16:54] Taxsvcs: Brute force and if dmg is not there, at the end turn in bloods, so you don't waste a 2nd attempt on that.
[1:16:55] iggy_pls: the SW:D nerf hit hard there you should've died
[1:16:55] realandtruephobe: @Badbotqt He doesn't lose ears at altar

[1:17:12] MysoreMango: Shouldn't he have feared you after block ?
[1:17:15] Big_Zum: @xaryu you have to bring the boss to the sea giant in booty bay and they 1v1 each other
[1:17:16] kiffa49: don‚Äôt you turn bijous from ZG at an alter in that island in the north?
[1:17:20] Slydawgy1: priests can beat you if they are good at the game OMEGALUL

[1:17:37] kiffa49: WHERE YOU TURN IN BIJOUS IS AN ALTER?
[1:17:41] idiotferaltko: have u dueled any good feral druids? Hard for you?.
[1:17:49] Phrosted_: @Xaryu wait do still not have stv cat mount?

[1:17:58] 404kg: Xaryu, are you gonna play hc self found?
[1:17:59] blazzedzz: I think you need less people so he gets less trophys and hopefully gets less HP at 20%

[1:18:06] mundanesickle: @Xaryu The island is the smaller one towards Westfall
[1:18:07] TobyNova: Do you think he's actually killable or Devs trolling? Did you see the Wowhead thread?
[1:18:09] baldanduseless: kite him to the blood sail buccaners and incite a pirate riot @Xaryu
[1:18:12] yami_yugi_87: @fuming_bumblebee does not need to be new to make sense and it does not say anything about hakkar it says Zanza
[1:18:12] al_capow: how would loot for him work? would it be personal loot?
[1:18:15] idiotferaltko: have u dueled any good feral druids? Hard for you?

[1:18:31] crappiefisher7: it HAS to be something else than brute force
[1:18:31] saund: the boss health stopped at 20%, it went up to 67 million, the coordinates 20,67 on the STV map leads to a place in the water where there is a shark exactly there, sharks are attracted and smell blood from far away, could be a hint @Xaryu
[1:18:33] ScryerTV: First to loot him

[1:19:00] knifeparty818: @Xaryu When you pull the boss he says "they said i was to weak" or something like that.. i wonder what the lore is behind that
[1:19:01] unsteddy: each prime sub takes an ear off the boss
[1:19:01] ajax_shank: xar, how does the boss work? how many players fight it at once
[1:19:02] Badbotqt: a tank + 4 heals grouped together for heals?
[1:19:02] hayvex: Think first attempt will be best today as itll have less ppl with most people still working
[1:19:03] nuhc: morning Josh. how‚Äôs the baby

[1:19:12] ParfumAmerican: As a Zandalary troll - to get the racial you need to go to the altar and bow to a loa, so the altare's are definetly a key
[1:19:14] myyrlidon: myyrlidon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! what up xar
[1:19:15] al_capow: if it drops a single chest you need to coordinate a songflower jump for it
[1:19:15] WaDaFruCK: IMO Best loot - it drops a single chest, first person to open it gets it. Just like STV arena
[1:19:18] WinterlyTM: will self found turn off once you‚Äôre 60?

[1:19:49] EXiTxi: Finkle Einhorn comes out of him and gives you a bag.
[1:19:51] rollinsthechamp: 1%?? too much 0.1% maybe
[1:19:52] yami_yugi_87: @fuming_bumblebee your so wrong, such a fool done trying to explain to a air head
[1:19:52] qc3rs: 16 slotter for everyone on the kill
[1:19:53] YzieGG: 0.01% pls :)
[1:19:57] kirk_hunts: That would destroy this event
[1:19:57] letholdis: true
[1:19:58] kirk_hunts: pplease no
[1:19:59] cookie_jayy: that would just turn the event into a PvE event which they didnt want
[1:20:00] toosmoothxo: sod is new right I‚Äôm not sure if there is lore?
[1:20:00] RastaPasta52: ppl would start to grief the event then
[1:20:02] boblewis13: true
[1:20:03] ShingaTV: if only the mount im instant out to kill this guy
[1:20:03] realandtruephobe: It should drop a quest item for everyone like ashenvale
[1:20:04] ichewbubblegumm: I don't think there is a loot table
[1:20:04] notgridles: less than 1% tho
[1:20:05] kiffa49: GO TO ISLAND YOU TURN IN BIJOUS
[1:20:05] KetsuN: Starve him of blood.  Get blood but never turn it in
[1:20:05] cavi_tv: What is there to do at 60 in SF? Theres no bgs right?
[1:20:07] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once?
[1:20:07] wavecadet: @rollinsthechamp its a 60% mount so 1% is fine lol
[1:20:09] fuming_bumblebee: @yami_yugi_87 lmfao. keep that tin foil hat on
[1:20:12] unsteddy: 99% silk cloth 1% mount
[1:20:12] cookie_jayy: The boss is not killable LUL
[1:20:12] necrotia113: he will drop nothing
[1:20:17] orrenico: Xar do you still think that the patch today was blizz addding/fixing stuff?
[1:20:18] Mico027: It should drop a note saying "good job"
[1:20:18] AbyssReborn: WHY NOT Kappa
[1:20:19] nuhc: how‚Äôs the baby?
[1:20:19] mookerBL: should not be less than 1% for a phase event
[1:20:19] ParfumAmerican: Altars are a Big Hint (wink)
[1:20:20] Gardeos: can u read the buff stv gives it has Party or Raid member so maybe a raid to kill the boss is a thing @Xaryu
[1:20:21] Badbotqt: @saund maybe it can‚Äôt be killed until 2067
[1:20:22] ripwarlock2: They wouldnt nerf it unless it was intended to be killed
[1:20:22] EnvironNA: boss being killable is kinda grief for the event no? cause then you cant get the mass bloods
[1:20:22] BIuffwatcher: prob meant to kill it later
[1:20:23] kb_h: or theres a trick to do it with 5
[1:20:23] Parametik: 100%
[1:20:25] vindiee: an npc on yojamba says "if you've come to save the world you've come to the right place.." @Xaryu
[1:20:25] c_curly: The boss might be for next phase
[1:20:27] ddevillax: @Xaryu ? what if its meant to be killed at level 60?
[1:20:27] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Xaryu could i ask what that s priest did that was good? I dont know priest very well so would like to learn what happen that impressed you https://clips.twitch.tv/ShyZanyCoffeeOneHand-T7uLD4v4uICIP3GB
[1:20:28] Ninetiz: maybe people arent geared enough yet
[1:20:28] blaise_pmk: HC HYPE HC HYPE
[1:20:28] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once??
[1:20:31] kickflipy: @Xaryu what if you have to /bow to something or someone? i mean there are emotes for runes in SoD
[1:20:31] Amoxychillen: down with socialism wow
[1:20:32] bushthebug: xaryu it is theorized that killing him opens ZG
[1:20:32] al_capow: if the boss dies and the buff goes away doesn't it grief the event by removing the blood buff?
[1:20:32] AdamNicholsMusic: @Xaryu did we find out if it was blizzard that made the health go up at 20%?
[1:20:33] bvndxg_joe: @Xaryu are ret paladins terrible?
[1:20:33] simplegeoffy: Everyone can't be partied up, but has to work together to kill the boss, but then has to fight it out for the loot cause blood moon.
[1:20:33] Midrid91: Maybe not meant to be killed now at lvl 40
[1:20:34] madamedog: it should take 25 mins to 300-400 ppl to kill it
[1:20:35] Badbotqt: if a GM shows up, they don‚Äôt want it killed
[1:20:36] realandtruephobe: Yeah the boss might be killable, but not intended to be killed you know what i mean?
[1:20:36] burnitdown_leon: the boss is not immune to the dmg so it should be killable
[1:20:37] 4wardsjack: its not too hard, we've only really tried twice
[1:20:38] dreamreamer: Why make a boss  that cant be killed tho.... thats kinda dumb
[1:20:38] AbyssReborn: THEY DID A SERVER SHUTDOWN THIS MORNING
[1:20:38] crainiam: But why wouldnt they want it killed? That would be so weird
[1:20:38] Astralthundr: probably not killed this phase
[1:20:39] archer2342: if they didn't want the boss killed why did a gm show up yesterday though @Xaryu
[1:20:40] trashcanff: HC HYPE HC HYPE
[1:20:41] parasKamu: does event end if boss dies?
[1:20:41] dumpdeer: have they not said before when we are not meant to kill something?
[1:20:42] MightyCactus1: afaik blizz has never made an unkillable npc boss right??
[1:20:42] BoonesHQ: i 19% agree with you that its overtuned
[1:20:44] pmanfit91: They might be waiting to see if you can get it done, then tune it appropriately. Similar to other PvE nerfs.
[1:20:45] PaxedUP: why even allow players to target boss if he cant die
[1:20:46] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once
[1:20:47] Kazunya_Meowryu: got ya
[1:20:47] romz622: you cant drag in BB ?
[1:20:49] lemonarque: at 20% all warriors need to bloodrage, charge at the boss, and taunt it while bloodrage is up to sacrifice themselves
[1:20:49] Retz1t: they dont want the boss to be killed yet, thats what my intuition says
[1:20:50] l0ud_h0use: How did you come up with the name Xaryu?
[1:20:51] zaguidar92: has somthing to do with sacrifice/bloods
[1:20:54] kirk_hunts: I think Blizzard is Season Of Discovering whether or not they want the boss killed currently and we'll find out their decision today.
[1:20:55] jojoshambho: My theory is maybe he'll be a boss in sunken temple, and they dont want him dead here
[1:20:55] BLUNDERGUN: gm just chilling for no reason eh
[1:20:55] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once?
[1:20:59] TheSerrion: FailFish
[1:20:59] ShingaTV: based
[1:20:59] annsiee: @Xaryu if they want the boss no killed then he will just not die and stay at 1hp not have a mechanic at 20%
[1:21:00] kboyyyyy: but how did he positon? u guys are both ranged lol
[1:21:01] Foldim: They dont have a loot pool ready for him yet so theyre stalling
[1:21:04] trapt6rr: 100% something about the arena and his HP getting cut instantly.. has to be it
[1:21:05] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once??
[1:21:10] Kazunya_Meowryu: yea thats very similar to fighting games too
[1:21:10] blazzedzz: He needs less trophys probably so he gets less hp at 20%
[1:21:13] WaDaFruCK: just like fighting games; its spacing
[1:21:15] nuhc: how‚Äôs Kai doing
[1:21:16] ddevillax: @Xaryu ? what if its meant to be killed at level 60?
[1:21:24] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once

[1:21:31] rickehb: there is 100% a strat that we haven‚Äôt figured out yet‚Ä¶. it can‚Äôt be that you need 500 players to kill him‚Ä¶
[1:21:34] Ezionn: I know how to get down the boss, should I release it or leave it for people to figure out ?
[1:21:34] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu Ahh Shucks, Thanks!
[1:21:34] tbseason: did u kill it
[1:21:37] saund: the boss health stopped at 20%, it went up to 67 million, the coordinates 20,67 on the STV map leads to a place in the water where there is a shark exactly there, sharks are attracted and smell blood from far away, could be a hint @Xaryu
[1:21:39] basedbay: wait i just tuned in, what did he do
[1:21:41] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once??

[1:22:01] tbseason: did u kill it? @Xaryu
[1:22:01] IanEdgerton: what if the boss kills you with poison does he take the poison effect to increase dps ???
[1:22:02] IuckyIee: what is the bosses name
[1:22:02] vindiee: @Xaryu talk to molthor on the island
[1:22:02] Midrid91: @ddevillax One very possible theory.
[1:22:04] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once!
[1:22:04] sighwarlock: @saund not the triangle shark theory again
[1:22:06] AbyssReborn: @Xaryu they did a server shutdown earlier.. maybe they hotfix it?
[1:22:07] ElletTV: !gear
[1:22:08] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu

[1:22:14] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once
[1:22:17] skaran27x: @Xaryu what layer are you in? Û†ÄÄ
[1:22:20] Jumballaya: blood god guy might be a catch-up mechanic intended for level 50 or 60? it might award honor/stv coins/gold
[1:22:23] cavi_tv: @saund NOW THATS SOME DETECTIVE WORK. The boss also WILL SWIM. Shark killing blow?!
[1:22:26] erectiliann: Bro you AOE farmed that horde hunter in thousand needles that extra arcane explosion was first degree murder ü§£
[1:22:26] EXiTxi: THats what i had thought initially. Epic mount.
[1:22:27] jallaballan: Do you win against boka?
[1:22:31] Kazunya_Meowryu: does melee have to worry much about positioning ? @Xaryu
[1:22:33] iStrudderz: enjoy STV for the next 6 months guys
[1:22:33] jallaballan: Bobka
[1:22:33] littlehak: 5Head
[1:22:34] Peschke9: how is  LF broken its the only dot us mages have compared to priests n stuff @Xaryu
[1:22:34] bushthebug: @Xaryu ive been saying he opens ZG so he isnt supposed to die yet

[1:22:36] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once??
[1:22:39] Thejacob250: Nah
[1:22:39] Tanthok: The mount could be an EPIC mount too
[1:22:40] letholdis: yeah thats the only real answer isits not for lvl 40 rn if its unkillable
[1:22:40] Badbotqt: and the GM healed it
[1:22:43] dutchsean: new opening of ZG
[1:22:43] blazzedzz: Less people less trophys less HP gain at 20%
[1:22:43] neimac2: could be an epic mount that he drops
[1:22:44] burnitdown_leon: or 50
[1:22:45] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu there was a buring warlock npc with a debuff on him in the arena, sorta where he dipped in health yesterday!
[1:22:46] YzieGG: but why would the hp go up at all
[1:22:48] kickflipy: @Xaryu what if you have to /bow to something or someone? i mean there are emotes for runes in SoD
[1:22:48] Bhimasena: YouDontSay
[1:22:49] TMMOOF: being the season of discovery. Maybe we need to discover the correct mechanic too tho
[1:22:50] Valeeraw_: BUT WE ARE GIGACHAD GAMERS !!!!!!!!!!
[1:22:50] ParfumAmerican: and it drops Ashbringer
[1:22:50] NGianga: NGianga subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! morning Xar, third times a charm homie!

[1:22:52] juice42069: that would be lame
[1:22:53] Lucons1: rare smart chatter
[1:22:53] Mittens777: @ajax_shank no one knows yet
[1:22:53] Galabanjo: but almost killable at 40 means closer to killable at 50?
[1:22:55] iStrudderz: who gets the drop
[1:22:56] Jarkhi_94: @Xaryu thank u from your streaming i really like watching u  u have good vibe that spread happeness and make my day fun i wish u happy life
[1:22:56] mysherryamour: @Xaryu  what layer are you on? if horde is trying to assist
[1:22:57] Ezionn: @xaryu When the boss falls to 0% it dies.
[1:22:58] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Then why put it like that in the game now?
[1:22:58] ripwarlock2: then why nerf it
[1:22:59] b1azzuris: @ajax_shank boss has no mechanics and hundreds fight it lol
[1:23:00] Quaztopher: or he‚Äôs just not supposed to be killed at all, lol
[1:23:01] Amoxychillen: what if bliz is just like.. oh fk, they expected THIS much content... quick add loot to him CODE CODE CODE
[1:23:02] bottis96: why the rerf
[1:23:02] Phoenix3215: then why would they nerf it?
[1:23:02] spellingbxd: they would definitely know that we would try it in phase 2 though
[1:23:02] sighwarlock: @shatteredlol thats just a rune
[1:23:03] pajatonttu: you just need 20 more raid groups
[1:23:03] nuhc: fuck man I‚Äôm still only level 16 on sod. shit looks so fuj
[1:23:03] kswissbaby: I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd introduce something that could be killable but not now
[1:23:04] unsteddy: World boss like the dragons, his enrage needs hunter glyph from MC to remove it
[1:23:04] nuhc: fun
[1:23:04] Tanthok: I thiink that is true
[1:23:05] ajax_shank: xar, retail gamer here. how does the boss work? how many fight it at once
[1:23:05] Quaztopher: major cooe
[1:23:07] Fai_z: that would be the most boring mechanic every
[1:23:10] Spooferproofn: I hope after all of this is done, we get the dev insight from aggrend
[1:23:11] largist_: maybe you need something from Sunken Temple raid in Phase 3, since there is also connection to Loa
[1:23:13] mysherryamour: @Xaryu  what layer are you on? if horde is trying to assist Û†ÄÄ
[1:23:13] StinkyPig: 250 players doing 100dps =1.5mil damage per minute
[1:23:13] letholdis: HP goes up to prevent the 40s from killing lol
[1:23:14] smokeshash: beeen thinking that alday
[1:23:14] romz622: there is maybe a trick to put him a bit more easier
[1:23:15] ddevillax: @Xaryu world boss for a future questline? or as a part of sunken temple quest?
[1:23:15] Tanthok: It could just be a bait
[1:23:17] biigredant: not it chief
[1:23:20] Valeeraw_: cause he kick her ass off
[1:23:23] Plokoon100: Maybe his anme is a anagram!

[1:23:25] Kazunya_Meowryu: does melee have to worry much about positioning ? @Xaryu
[1:23:26] Gamalimbo: The reason behind nerfing it was for it not to be so big it fit the whole screen
[1:23:26] konstik92: Why do they implement him already ?
[1:23:27] burnitdown_leon: yes
[1:23:27] realandtruephobe: It's kind of trollish to show him with much less health then only have his health jump at 20%
[1:23:27] curedubs: YES
[1:23:27] tbseason: no
[1:23:29] curedubs: TAKE HIM THREE
[1:23:29] mysherryamour: @Xaryu  what layer are you on? if horde is trying to assist

[1:30:07] freakyfrog69: find a way to turn his bloods, we get coins maybe he will get weaker
[1:30:08] RollinSpinnas: they wouldn‚Äôt of nerfed and helped if you cant
[1:30:08] spellingbxd: maybe you dont actually *kill* him...he just gives up when you do something special to him. like wandering swordsman
[1:30:09] Vichrinox: if he cant die, blizzard fucked up
[1:30:10] Rampetroll: its like saying "You can't hack me"
[1:30:14] NoGrave: what if that's how you get the Bengal tiger @Xaryu
[1:30:14] yami_yugi_87: They never said he cant die they just said you wotn have fun
[1:30:16] TMMOOF: o7
[1:30:16] MongoSecurity: Owned
[1:30:19] Quaztopher: you know that this shits not able to be killed lol, you doin this for content at this point. I‚Äôm out buddy
[1:30:20] obajawanke: Are you trying for the kill in an hour  and 15 minites?
[1:30:24] eclipsethenextone: So what you're saying is no means yes @xaryu
[1:30:24] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss?
[1:30:24] Tanov96: @Xaryu what about coodinates with 20% 67hp? Û†ÄÄ
[1:30:25] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: shatted on

[1:30:42] RedsquaredTV: Why don't you run icy veins to help get off heals and casts against classes like hunter that push you back a lot?
[1:30:46] wreckshoptv: is the HC ssf out yet?
[1:30:46] killawatts75: my theory is if it wasn‚Äôt intended to be killed why would they bother nerfing him @xaryu
[1:30:47] PaxedUP: people will keep DDOSing until the boss is killable
[1:30:47] HotGrandma69420: internet explorer havin ahhh kekw

[1:30:49] Plokoon100: has anyone checked the island with teh big monkey>
[1:30:49] cavi_tv: Im with @Tanov96 , (20,67)
[1:30:51] ikkiweber: yep def asmon is the key
[1:30:51] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:30:53] croutomz: someone call fucking asmongold....we need him to assemble the army
[1:30:53] Azulion: Imagine he just sits at 1hp and doesn't die
[1:30:53] capataz45: Are you doing Hardcore Self-Made?
[1:30:55] saund: the boss health stopped at 20%, it went up to 67 million, the coordinates 20,67 on the STV map leads to a place in the water where there is a shark exactly there, sharks are attracted and smell blood from far away, could be a hint @Xaryu
[1:30:55] disar27: sooo huge idea. what if that is how you get the bengal tiger
[1:30:56] Feuerbuechse: plz show your Frost specc @xaryu ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

[1:30:56] zaguidar92: boss will reset
[1:30:57] Ninetiz: lol
[1:30:58] ddevillax: @Xaryu what if the boss is meant to be killed as lvl 60 world boss for a future questline? or as a part of sunken temple quest?
[1:30:58] zaguidar92: lol
[1:30:59] curedubs: bring him in the water!
[1:31:00] NoGrave: KEKW

[1:31:07] graziNNN: yikes
[1:31:07] AdamNicholsMusic: bring the boss into stormwind
[1:31:07] Tanthok: @Xaryu wasn't the tiger an epic mount back in the day?
[1:31:08] ScottyUSMC: they do have the altar down in the water there
[1:31:09] Frostlicious: Unboon angle
[1:31:09] Malfunked38: bring chiptole to Asmon?
[1:31:10] ii_poncho_via_ii: the sperg army
[1:31:10] darkwingduck06: Naga waterfall buff!
[1:31:11] Yamamoto78: asmongold would just make it more laggy
[1:31:11] BoyeTV: Get swifty in here
[1:31:11] Amoxychillen: Idk my gf is the blood god rn
[1:31:12] wreckshoptv: purge it
[1:31:13] RockstarPunched: show him the bald
[1:31:14] bigholyd: get asmon to play
[1:31:16] dreamreamer: SUMMON 10000 ASMON COCKROACHES LOLOL
[1:31:16] Lucons1: chat is onto nothing LUL
[1:31:16] lo0t_r: @Xaryu do you do more damage if you have max blood at 255?
[1:31:16] xNotMat: bring him to asmons house = instant death
[1:31:17] Nize2: theres lowkey a hidden elite that can fight him
[1:31:18] Vichrinox: its the ears, he heals based on the number of deaths
[1:31:18] voncline88: asmongolds blood must be offered
[1:31:18] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: good luck getting asmon to stop reacting to play wow
[1:31:21] thorongir: whole raid needs to be poisoned
[1:31:23] boblewis13: the sperg lord returns
[1:31:23] squarepusher_: I don't think you're supposed to kill the boss by infection though
[1:31:23] bhoffey: bring him to booty bay
[1:31:23] leeth58: Can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss?
[1:31:24] cutexlol_: @Amoxychillen OMEGALUL
[1:31:24] lemonarque: You have to run an STV GDKP, receiving a ban, sacrificing your accounts to the blood god
[1:31:25] Redhed_Iou: get asmon to eat a vegetable and you get a mount?
[1:31:26] Feuerbuechse: !gear
[1:31:27] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[1:31:27] hearingblockchain: bring asmon in for reinforcements @Xaryu
[1:31:27] Kilraith: I don't know sounds like in this phase he might not be killable
[1:31:28] ninetysix: @Xaryu kite a elite dragon to khadamu before event
[1:31:29] saund: Coordinates 20/67 leads you to shark, which is where the bosses health stopped and his health increased to @Xaryu
[1:31:32] NoGrave: have you seen the video if asmongold was a raid boss hahahah
[1:31:33] MightyCactus1: @Xaryu I believe there was another tweet hint that mentioned turning in boat loads of blood makes kha damu friendly and 'possibly' gives a reward
[1:31:33] saund: on the map
[1:31:34] Zownos: @Xaryu if you do the Zandalari opt out buff, can you still attack him or no? Could just need everyone to talk to the Zandalari guys ??
[1:31:36] GreenLizzardx: mage spell detect magic maby gice a hint at 20%
[1:31:36] Vichrinox: touche xaryu
[1:31:37] YzieGG: I bet his HP goes up at 10% again KEKW
[1:31:38] JukezZA: @xaryu the mechanic where he charges and 1 shots people and heals, what if the person he charges is on the altar as a sacrifice?
[1:31:38] Mambalo: idk but initially boss only seems to be there to stop ppl from forming raids in the event
[1:31:38] billybeer181920: you need mike tyson to bite all his ears of
[1:31:38] roxkleber: Hunters can win mages in duels on this phase ?
[1:31:39] RollinSpinnas: any poison clouds you can think of? like the flayers from Hakkar?
[1:31:40] MrN3xuz: I mean, if they dont want us to kill him, why did they add the mechanic where he doesnt heal if you have blood
[1:31:41] packtar: as others have said there is a shark at coord 20 67
[1:31:44] Diezy: Roachgod vs bloodgod
[1:31:44] bushthebug: @xaryu what if a certain amount of people have to /delete by the altar. a TRUE blood sacrifice. or Makgora
[1:31:46] yaybump: need a bunch of raids!
[1:31:48] StinkyPig: 250players at 100dps is 1.5m damage per minute. Boss is can be killed.
[1:31:49] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss?
[1:31:49] Tyromebiggums: need mitchjones
[1:31:49] YazzLivee: its not true otherwise they wouldnt limited the stacks to 255 counter intuitive
[1:31:49] gooshmagic12: LOl @billybeer181920
[1:31:50] Sillychops: last boss in gnomer gives you disease
[1:31:51] WaDaFruCK: maybe the amount of health buff he gets is based on ear count?
[1:31:52] Feuerbuechse: @deatharmor98 Ty
[1:31:53] GreenLizzardx: mage spell detect magic maby gice a hint at 20%.
[1:31:54] RebornOG: if the blood makes him stronger why do we bring him blood ? @Xaryu
[1:31:55] Tanov96: @Xaryu what about coodinates with 20% 67hp? Û†ÄÄ
[1:31:55] unsteddy: 250 might just be the hardcap, so doesn;t matter if he kills more
[1:31:56] yaybump: do you get a debuff for boss in raid?
[1:31:57] adora_the_explora: Xar what server are you on?
[1:31:57] sergogg95: @Xaryu, how are you handling the baby, bro? The father of 3 3-month-old is here.
[1:31:58] ParfumAmerican: what does avoiding him means?
[1:32:00] blaaaaakee: what if youre supposed to right click your blood stacks
[1:32:01] linkitcraig: Are you coordinating with the horde?
[1:32:04] adora_the_explora: What server is Xar on?
[1:32:07] carlphilip97: yo xaryu! youtube watcher made it to ur stream today!
[1:32:09] xpredicts: Feed the blood loa enought blood a day he will be satisfied?
[1:32:10] gnated: they wouldnt
[1:32:11] eclipsethenextone: Has anyone checked zg? @xaryu
[1:32:11] AdamNicholsMusic: I dont think you are meant to kill the boss. It is taking streamers getting together and organising it to take it down. They wouldnt do that @Xaryu
[1:32:12] caypr: @Xaryu any mobs in STV specifically trolls that you can mind control for a debuff?
[1:32:15] spellingbxd: @adora_the_explora crusader strike us
[1:32:15] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:32:15] gnated: thats not it
[1:32:16] Koai23: makes no sense at all
[1:32:18] Diddly_dope: they didnt
[1:32:19] LyxorrTV: @Xaryu Kill trolls in the area on top of him to offer their blood
[1:32:19] snyderhauss: Why not people love kiting shit
[1:32:19] RollinSpinnas: I‚Äôm with you on the kiting. that would take too long
[1:32:21] pockets519: got to work hard for that mount
[1:32:22] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:32:22] Riji07: I think thats a valid theory
[1:32:24] Valencia_Pete: have yall tried fighting him with max blood stacks or are you just getting some blood and going in
[1:32:25] Deatharmor98: @Feuerbuechse You can click the calculator to see the talent tree too, its weird cause it doesnt show what 1 point he took out for Ice Barrier, i personally take one point of Permafrost and put it in Ice Barrier
[1:32:28] Diddly_dope: yeah its a 60 wg
[1:32:28] ScryerTV: Tranq shot gg
[1:32:28] mitsankladan: start inviting people
[1:32:29] hache_esse: @YazzLivee is just 2^8, might be leftover from original classic
[1:32:29] Ninetiz: or 50 !
[1:32:30] Gumbot: go behind ZG and see if theres anything back there
[1:32:35] Zownos: @Xaryu if you do the Zandalari opt out buff, can you still attack him or no? Could just need everyone to talk to the Zandalari guys ??
[1:32:36] ddevillax: thats what i said
[1:32:36] Ninetiz: Might be phase 3 boss
[1:32:36] Odezq: @Xaryu its simply just dps race, u just cant do it in one event, u need one event before to gather ppl their bloods and save them for next event and burst
[1:32:41] RollinSpinnas: I think it‚Äôs a ZF chain
[1:32:46] GreenLizzardx: mage spell detect magic maby gice a hint at 20%
[1:32:46] beethvnn: i think it drops nothing KEKW
[1:32:46] adora_the_explora: XARYU .......what server are you on?: )
[1:32:46] NoGrave: Hmm
[1:32:47] SmashTheDude: @Xaryu maybe some random trolls/mobs can have a buff that can be applied with mind control
[1:32:48] WilesDS: if he stays the same at phase 2 then its def killable
[1:32:50] Riji07: its called season of discovery maybe they want u to discover something?
[1:32:51] mitsankladan: start Inviting people!!!
[1:32:51] azlum0: show your talents please?
[1:32:52] curedubs: its a blue mount tho
[1:32:52] TURBO_EXTREME: but bengal tiger is only a 60% mount
[1:32:52] disar27: nahhhh they woudlnt have released it now
[1:32:52] Ninetiz: yup
[1:32:53] Fnafson: nope
[1:32:53] BIuffwatcher: I think "p2" was them panic hotfixing it
[1:32:54] SuaSponte: yeah agreed
[1:32:55] geminuspr: COPIUM
[1:32:55] ShingaTV: for me its killable at 40 but they scaled the boss wrong as most of the time since its a 200 ppl guy
[1:32:55] ScryerTV: Tranq shot GGs
[1:32:56] dutchsean: or even it will drop a legendary
[1:32:56] mylittlehombre: nah because you wouldn‚Äôt be able to hit the boss if it were too high
[1:32:56] Ninetiz: I agree
[1:32:56] mandude42069: i feel like that kills people wanting to do this event at 40
[1:32:56] smokeshash: who first said it drops a mount???!?
[1:32:56] chasingshadowsz: nope
[1:32:56] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:32:56] ripwarlock2: no
[1:32:57] M0rley_: no
[1:32:57] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:32:57] Nappycans: IT DOES
[1:32:58] tmigwans1: bingo
[1:32:58] 13brill: YES
[1:32:58] mylittlehombre: nope
[1:32:58] hearingblockchain: no it doesnt
[1:32:59] Shiromar515: 100% makes the most sense
[1:32:59] JukezZA: @adora_the_explora !server
[1:32:59] sklingel: 100%
[1:32:59] Psyphin808: NOPERS
[1:33:00] afk_rudy: u reaching
[1:33:00] Tanov96: @Xaryu what about coodinates with 20% 67hp?
[1:33:00] simplegeoffy: and also it's during teh pvp event
[1:33:01] ricktickticcow: Then why isn't it lvl 60?
[1:33:01] ApoxNaN: yes
[1:33:01] desweck: 0 sense
[1:33:01] chasingshadowsz: nopee
[1:33:01] Parametik: but why would blizz implement a 60% mount for a lvl 60???
[1:33:01] DrazaTraza: everyone would be missing thho
[1:33:01] xtheairkingx: Yes
[1:33:01] Achoo77: yea
[1:33:02] KG1909: You are selling somebody elses idea as your idea now, lol
[1:33:02] Shiromar515: or at LEAST level 50
[1:33:02] Himaru7: so he drops lvl 60 gear :D
[1:33:02] TMMOOF: but they aren't incentivizing going back to Ashenvale, so why STV?
[1:33:02] ub3rm0nk3y: makes no sense
[1:33:02] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:33:03] RollinSpinnas: I think it has to do with ZF
[1:33:04] akvokrom: no
[1:33:05] powerstraw2: not an epic mount
[1:33:05] largist_: it might be in phase 3, maybe you get something from Sunken Temple raid since it is also Loa based
[1:33:05] thedaestra: think GM gave it more health?
[1:33:06] yung_jed: why wouldn‚Äôt they just add it back in p4 to get more people to come back to STV
[1:33:06] BLUNDERGUN: @Xaryu if the servers were stable we wouldve 100% had enough dps for both phases
[1:33:06] kswissbaby: doesn‚Äôt make sense lol
[1:33:07] Diddly_dope: they panic buffed it forsure
[1:33:08] awfulist: Then why did they add the mount into p2 why not stick it in later, knowing it will be datamined
[1:33:08] Lagbolta: Gamba for event????
[1:33:08] Morkaa: Why would they implement it this phase then?
[1:33:10] mylittlehombre: no because you wouldn‚Äôt be able to hit it
[1:33:10] Riji07: discovering smth that can kill him makes more sense
[1:33:12] Azulion: If this does drop a mount, then at 60 people won't be working together, they'll fight each other for the tag
[1:33:12] ninetysix: no xaryu, we need gold lots of gold to buy supplies from ah
[1:33:12] Fnafson: how tf did he drop to 50%?
[1:33:13] swidey221: @xaryu why would they nerf it now though
[1:33:14] squarepusher_: Name a boss in wow history that increases its lifepool as a phase.
[1:33:14] spellingbxd: @ricktickticcow its a skull level like all bosses
[1:33:15] Zownos: @Xaryu if you do the Zandalari opt out buff, can you still attack him or no? Could just need everyone to talk to the Zandalari guys ??
[1:33:15] Riggidy_Ray: itd be like running into High Lord Kruul at 40
[1:33:16] Vaako888: why put boss now if intend for 60?
[1:33:18] sal92mc06: How could it drop gear, wouldn't it have been datamined already?
[1:33:18] zaguidar92: he was close bro
[1:33:19] ShingaTV: ofc its scaled wrong

[1:33:21] Riggidy_Ray: makes perfect sense
[1:33:21] GreenLizzardx: mage spell detect magic maby gice a hint at 20%
[1:33:22] Tanov96: check the coodinates at 20,67 coz of 20% hp and 67mil
[1:33:22] WaDaFruCK: Maybe the hp buff he gets is based on # of ears? feed him less and he gets less max hp?
[1:33:23] Morkaa: Why would they implement it this phase then??
[1:33:23] packtar: probably but we don't what to hear that and wait for 6 months
[1:33:24] s20096321: True, and everyone able to get loot

[1:33:29] acturs: chat when is boss? 1 hour?
[1:33:29] blaaaaakee: what if theres a vial you put your collected bloods in and use it on the boss
[1:33:31] dalmationx: Making sense makes sure you are incorrect as we are talking blizz
[1:33:31] shadowvypers: makes sense but challenge accepted
[1:33:31] Vichrinox: theory is they dont want him to die
[1:33:33] Parametik: were discoveriiiiiing
[1:33:34] KosmicDevil_: maybe run away on the phase change
[1:33:35] Amoxychillen: The other theory is blizz didnt make any content obv
[1:33:37] Wrenzoe: the other theory is that blizzard does not intend for us to kill this boss
[1:33:37] astraldex: why did the GM take the boss to an altar?
[1:33:38] ze_puncho: the faster ypu get him to P2, the longer you have to drain 14M HP
[1:33:39] acturs: when does boss spawn chat? 1 hour?

[1:33:42] Riggidy_Ray: it heals u
[1:33:42] caypr: @Xaryu any mobs in STV specifically trolls that you can mind control for a debuff? Û†ÄÄ

[1:33:43] Gamalimbo: Thats the priest rune item
[1:33:43] outlastyou69: How much HP do wold bosses have at level 60 in classic?

[1:33:58] gooshmagic12: quest item
[1:33:58] mellven: Bengal Tiger Mount Twitch Prime drop for SoD confirmed
[1:33:59] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:34:00] Mister_Kooze: What if the LESS alter turn ins we give, the weaker he stays? Wouldn't blood for the blood god make him strong?
[1:34:00] NGianga: you need all the trolls blood pots maybe?
[1:34:01] skimansr: for a priest rune @Xaryu
[1:34:01] Zownos: @Xaryu Check your discord, i pinged you
[1:34:02] pheigngaming: Try to have the least amount of people die to him as possible?
[1:34:02] NoGrave: TBC was kind of like that, fel reaver was deadly until later
[1:34:02] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:34:04] chasingshadowsz: The other theory is that you havent found out how to kill him yet
[1:34:04] saund: go to coordinates 20,67 which were the health changes to boss, it brings you to shark near corsair cove, maybe the shark drops an item for killing blow @Xaryu
[1:34:04] lemonarque: the boss needs to be tanked by a Blood DK
[1:34:04] SaintMichael88: also used in one quest in westfall
[1:34:05] Parametik: dispersion rune item
[1:34:05] WaDaFruCK: Maybe the hp buff he gets is based on # of ears? feed him less and he gets less max hp?

[1:34:11] TMMOOF: Xaryu have you gone over the alchemy potion that poisons your blood yet?
[1:34:12] Zownos: @Xaryu check discord
[1:34:12] Vichrinox: more troll blood before we attack the boss?
[1:34:12] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:34:13] Jussthetip: anyone look at the irradiated bombs from gnomer for this since they are useless there?
[1:34:13] ub3rm0nk3y: WHAT IF WE ALL HAVE TO RP CAUSE ITS AN RP SERVER?
[1:34:13] curedubs: @eyonixz bewcause its fun
[1:34:17] Joxtirol: it's start quest for a trinket
[1:34:17] tryumpfh: muukla
[1:34:17] kehayov: he has an abilty called blood leach which heals him from people that are near him , when you guys were in the arena the casters were far away and you melted him
[1:34:22] Zownos: @Xaryu if you do the Zandalari opt out buff, can you still attack him or no? Could just need everyone to talk to the Zandalari guys ??
[1:34:23] maniiieelll: just dps it down
[1:34:24] drjabbar: Adora this is crusader strike server
[1:34:24] huntgray17: @xaryu you‚Äôre the best wow streamer

[1:34:27] thejiggler1: Holy protection potion?
[1:34:27] Mambalo: It has 3 times the HP of Azuregos
[1:34:27] BIuffwatcher: why not... its fun to reach
[1:34:27] Dareka1111: back to gy zerg strat
[1:34:29] Parametik: that
[1:34:30] tryumpfh: monkey
[1:34:31] zaguidar92: why would a gm come help you
[1:34:32] mellven: Bengal Tiger Mount Twitch Prime drop for SoD confirmed
[1:34:32] Guydx: The boss has been nerfed?
[1:34:33] lemonarque: everyone needs to drink a Mighty Troll's Blood Potion
[1:34:33] cutexlol_: would be funny if he's not intended to die and drops nothing but the devs see this and implement a loottable LUL
[1:34:34] boblewis13: so people woildnt get oneshot
[1:34:34] ShingaTV: makes no sense
[1:34:34] awfulist: Why would they add the mount in this phase KNOWING it would be datamined?
[1:34:34] thedaestra: why was GM there yesterday?
[1:34:35] Ervill1: why would they nerf it now then
[1:34:35] Vichrinox: why nerf it now then?
[1:34:35] realandtruephobe: I think we should try to just zerg it down with a stupid amount of people
[1:34:35] billybeer181920: they nerfed it because you guys are trying hahaha
[1:34:35] MightyCactus1: Im confused what was the nerf to this boss??
[1:34:37] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:34:37] lizardboiy: bro
[1:34:38] heyimtazz: Why would trhere even be a boss in the first place if not to kill some way
[1:34:38] WaDaFruCK: Maybe the hp buff he gets is based on # of ears? feed him less and he gets less max hp?
[1:34:38] Wew_lad_: Chatting dont try stop having fun
[1:34:38] Dylanooooo: Because people couldnt farm their coins lmao
[1:34:39] peashooterpete: I think they saw you trying and nerfed it lol
[1:34:39] PineappleDuh: why would they nerf the boss if it wasn't supposed to be killed til 60?
[1:34:39] ttvnorbitaker: brute force for sure
[1:34:39] Riji07: i can u can lvl 40 but u have to discover smth
[1:34:40] 4wardsjack: i think its supposed to be killed in 1 hour and 10 minutes
[1:34:41] EzPickenz1: get 2 40 raids
[1:34:41] ShingaTV: why scale it down when not now killable
[1:34:41] yaybump: Why can we hit it then?
[1:34:41] juice42069: they wouldnt have nerfed it at all if lvl 60
[1:34:42] GreenLizzardx: but why nerf now if it is to kill at 60
[1:34:42] Fujinator: the hp going up and a GM showing up at the same time does say something
[1:34:42] Yamamoto78: they might have nerfed the boss because it was killing to many ppl in normal events
[1:34:43] Vichrinox: @xaryu WHY NERF IT NOW THEN
[1:34:44] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: just dps harder bro
[1:34:44] pazicity: Why would they nerf it now then?
[1:34:44] Psyphin808: why put it in now?
[1:34:45] Astralthundr: why would they nerf it NOW though if its supposed to be killed at 60?
[1:34:46] StinkyPig: why would they nerf it if they didnt want it killed till 60? @Xaryu
[1:34:46] Guydx: What has been nerfed about it?
[1:34:46] schmoogiebear: but it's not a level 60 boss!!
[1:34:46] disar27: READ THIS so I am sure its meant to be killed... blizz KNEW if they released it now, with SOD exploration hype everyone wouldve tried to kill it.. so they wouldnt have releasedi t
[1:34:47] lizardboiy: GMs can add as much HP as they want
[1:34:47] fuming_bumblebee: nerf the boss because how much it was owning ppl with cleave and not single target
[1:34:47] Breakfist_: why put a giant blood good in world of warcraft if ur not meant to kill it?
[1:34:48] GreenLizzardx: not good one
[1:34:48] Psico_420: @Xaryu where did you see boss nerf
[1:34:48] Eggzactly54: if it wasnt supposed to be killed gm's wouldnt be there watching interested
[1:34:48] RebornOG: if the blood makes him stronger why do we bring him blood ? @Xaryu  Û†ÄÄ
[1:34:49] sinda1983: but why nerf him now when he should be killed at 50 or 60?
[1:34:50] ttvnorbitaker: do one good attempt
[1:34:50] ricktickticcow: Why would they nerf if there weren't suppose to kill it at 40 and instead at 60?
[1:34:51] aoespawn: 42-0 watchm7Mald stergeMove pikabooMove
[1:34:51] sal92mc06: Why nerf it now?
[1:34:51] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:34:52] Amoxychillen: THEN LETS GBRUTE FUCKING FORCE IT
[1:34:53] EXiTxi: If it were a 60 boss, we would be MISSING every hit at our level. @Xaryu
[1:34:53] zaguidar92: there is a way to kill oit
[1:34:54] yaybump: @xaryu why can we hit boss then???
[1:34:54] Zownos: @Xaryu I think i have a new idea - if you do the Zandalari opt out buff, can you still attack him or no? Could just need everyone to talk to the Zandalari guys ??
[1:34:55] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^' Û†ÄÄ
[1:34:55] Redhed_Iou: ranged only
[1:34:55] ttvnorbitaker: then try other strats
[1:34:57] pheigngaming: Why would they add a boss that is unkillable this phase though?
[1:34:57] EzPickenz1: 2 40m raids
[1:34:57] Wrenzoe: The amount of people and coordination that is required to kill the boss seems off if they wanted us to actually kill the boss
[1:34:58] gloneiric: Gms stopping you because the loot isn't for lvl 40s?
[1:34:58] PaperbackWritter: then why nerf it now?
[1:34:59] Saturos47: @Xaryu i think it wasnt supposed to be killed, then the devs saw the hype and wanted to add a reward, but they werent ready so they added a ton of hp to him by a gm
[1:34:59] RollinSpinnas: I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a 50 ZF thing. keep people interested in Bloodmoon
[1:35:01] Meanpandah: gms are probably laughing their asses off watching these tho
[1:35:02] KIILLINIT: servers cant handle it right now
[1:35:02] Unfragged: i mean you're wearing classic level 60 gear
[1:35:03] SmashTheDude: maybe shamans and paladin can FUSION and create an imba class that one shots the boss
[1:35:04] croutomz: @EzPickenz1 they had 8 40 man raid yesterday
[1:35:06] Vichrinox: they would nerf it in phase 4 if that was the case
[1:35:06] callerino12345: feels like all the streamers are just making up a bunch of delusional theories
[1:35:06] tbseason: its season of DISCOVERY... it could not be killable, it could be with no loot, it could be with sod exclusive loot. who knows
[1:35:08] Synalars: What would be the point of implementing it now ?
[1:35:09] EXiTxi: just damage during blood craze not increasing
[1:35:11] realandtruephobe: It IS possible, that he's not meant to be killed, has no loot, but can still actually be killed with enough ppl.
[1:35:11] RaptorialX: did boss drop anything?
[1:35:12] Ervill1: they would nerf if only if it was too hard at 50 or 60 when intended
[1:35:12] Reinert7284: why nerf it now if its not supposed to be till 60
[1:35:15] ShingaTV: @PaperbackWritter y he is on copium with the 60 thign^^
[1:35:15] juicylucymeatymadness: It probably drops quest that gives 5% damage buff
[1:35:16] Nivekpro: click on classic at the top
[1:35:16] disar27: why would they nerf if its not even supposed to be part of this phase content????
[1:35:18] HelluvaWrecks: its heal was nerfed, so it wouldve been unkillable at any level before the nerf
[1:35:19] jbeemerks: could have killed it yesterday with no lag
[1:35:19] Riji07: why would they nerf it now if u need to kill it p4 in like august
[1:35:21] xNotMat: Plot twist: He drops level 60 items only Kappa
[1:35:23] letholdis: @Xaryu why would they nerf a boss not ment ot be killed
[1:35:23] packtar: he does less damage
[1:35:24] Pixiepantss: Pixiepantss subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! less than three
[1:35:24] disar27: why would they nerf if its not even supposed to be part of this phase content???? clear indication there.
[1:35:25] totemsilence11: did you kill the lad yet?
[1:35:26] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:35:26] tangdill: Can some one explaione to me whjat they are doin?
[1:35:26] yaybump: @ xaryu why can we hit it then?? if they're changing it now in p2 then wwe are meant to down it now
[1:35:28] Geleff: If it's made to be a lvl 60 world boss, there ain't no way you can brute force it as lvl 40s. The difference between those levels are insane. Go and try to brute force any of the emerald dragons, see how it goes.
[1:35:30] saund: go to coordinates 20,67 on the STV map which were the health changes to boss, it brings you to shark near corsair cove, maybe the shark drops an item for killing blow if you have blood on you @Xaryu
[1:35:32] Vaako888: @xaryu why add boss now if only for lvl 60?
[1:35:33] jackcousteau: Turn in bloods, it got chunked to 50 on the first attempt ‚Äî maybe horde turning in bloods.
[1:35:36] disar27: why would they nerf if its not even supposed to be part of this phase content???? clear indication there.....
[1:35:37] Zownos: @Xaryu if you do the Zandalari opt out buff, can you still attack him or no? Could just need everyone to talk to the Zandalari guys ??
[1:35:37] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:35:42] Saturos47: @Xaryu i think it wasnt supposed to be killed, then the devs saw the hype and wanted to add a reward, but they werent ready so they added a ton of hp to him by a gm
[1:35:44] Zownos: @Xaryu if you do the Zandalari opt out buff, can you still attack him or no? Could just need everyone to talk to the Zandalari guys?
[1:35:46] jbeemerks: it was dying to people doing 30% normal dps
[1:35:49] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:35:52] disar27: why would they nerf if its not even supposed to be part of this phase content???? clear indication there......
[1:35:53] ScryerTV: thats 2023.
[1:35:53] CuppaCoffeh: If you are not supposed to kill it or try - why nerf it
[1:35:55] Parametik: why adjust it now tho if its meant to be kiled by 60's
[1:36:00] staboca: i think theres another boss after you kill it
[1:36:03] SurianSkyborn: Could Touch of Zanzil have something to do with it?
[1:36:04] packtar: His damage was nerfed
[1:36:05] realandtruephobe: @saund The boss's total health pool jumps to 68m, not 67, also his actual health only jumps to around 13.4m
[1:36:06] SurianSkyborn: Seems like a stretch but
[1:36:08] Norcore: @Zownos they tried that already. if you opt out you can't have blood, if you don't have blood the boss has insane self sustain.
[1:36:10] cookie_jayy: just cause they nerf him does not correlate that he can be killed
[1:36:14] aoespawn: lol looking up quests‚Ä¶ xaryu u legend
[1:36:14] Vichrinox: Also why would a GM tank for us yesterday if we werent supposed to kill it
[1:36:15] mik_evans: it was on the 26th of feb
[1:36:18] Sillychops: probs just cant die to him, that's why gm was tanking it
[1:36:19] lemonarque: everyone drinks mighty troll's blood so that when he kills you, he absorbs troll blood instead of your blood
[1:36:21] Zownos: @Norcore ahhh damnm!
[1:36:24] disar27: why would they nerf if its not even supposed to be part of this phase content???? clear indication there..,
[1:36:29] madamedog: HUGE nerf
[1:36:29] crainiam: payoS
[1:36:31] desweck: i think you're supposed to fight him WITH blood til 80%, then turn in, and fight with NO blood past 20
[1:36:32] Riji07: make him less crazy lol
[1:36:33] billybeer181920: hahahha thats to stop killing players
[1:36:34] ShingaTV: means he is tankable
[1:36:35] Ervill1: he still one shots so no difference
[1:36:36] GoodGriffey: Xar AG1 just posted a job and I applied can you put in a good word for me? lol
[1:36:36] Redhed_Iou: why change that???
[1:36:37] heyimtazz: blood craze is the 20% mech?
[1:36:39] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^' Û†ÄÄ
[1:36:39] ImSo1337: They wouldnt be changing him if he wasnt ment to be killed
[1:36:39] joestopfarmingshako: It's so he doesn't 1 shot people participating
[1:36:40] Yamamoto78: just sounds like hes killing to many players in normal events
[1:36:40] ogkoop: that alone means its meant to be killed
[1:36:40] 13brill: Significant change
[1:36:41] Himaru7: @Xaryu tbh blizz never overthinked bosses with mechanics ever
[1:36:42] adora_the_explora: WHAT SERVER is XAR ON!!!!
[1:36:43] DrSkittles: That's not even a nerf tbh.
[1:36:43] MurtagDev: he already 1 shot everyone
[1:36:43] Qeevdo: I mean, that could just be to make him less annoying during the blood moon
[1:36:45] disar27: exavctly
[1:36:45] letholdis: WHY WOULD THEY NERF IT IF IT WASENT MENT OT BE KILLED
[1:36:46] mundanesickle: Blood crazee is likely phase 2
[1:36:46] Fujinator: @Xaryu thats not a nerf if he already 1 shots people, its a level 60 nerf
[1:36:47] Diddly_dope: cause he was ganking everyone around
[1:36:48] ShingaTV: because he is now tankable @Xaryu
[1:36:48] Nivekpro: It was to nerf people insta dying to his blood AoE during the event @Xaryu
[1:36:52] realandtruephobe: Dude that dev's smile when she was saying to stay away was a dead giveaway in my opinion
[1:36:52] cookie_jayy: prolly cause he was too OP 1 shotting everything
[1:36:52] sinda1983: why nerf him now when he is for later?
[1:36:52] billybeer181920: OMEGALUL verthinking
[1:36:52] fuming_bumblebee: ya but hes still 1 shotting basically everyone lmfao
[1:36:53] hrod1life: He still knew shots abyone
[1:36:53] Astralthundr: especially now?
[1:36:56] chasingshadowsz: huh
[1:36:56] Saturos47: @Xaryu what if it wasnt supposed to be killed, then the devs saw the hype and wanted to add a reward, but they werent ready so they added a ton of hp to him by a gm
[1:36:56] sklingel: so less players are killed by him during the event
[1:36:56] itschefmike: Propper tanks with healers
[1:36:57] rjhardy90: Did you try poisoning yourself
[1:36:58] flop: @xaryu we killin it today or what???!?
[1:37:00] zakkoncrak: naw
[1:37:00] 13brill: Why lower damage if not killable
[1:37:02] ripwarlock2: That's not really a change that has to do with killing him.. its probably just to stop him from 1 shotting people instead of getting cleaved for 80% of ur hp
[1:37:02] zak618: tankable (by a GM)
[1:37:04] zakkoncrak: just survive
[1:37:04] disar27: he is supposed to die now
[1:37:05] DrSkittles: Nah, that's just to make sure he doesn't start 1 shotting everyone in the event.
[1:37:05] Yamamoto78: @xaryu just sounds like hes killing to many players in normal events
[1:37:06] burnitdown_leon: blizzard saw that no one tried the boss so they nerfed it @Xaryu
[1:37:07] adora_the_explora: WHAT SERVER DOES XAR PLAY ON??
[1:37:09] cookie_jayy: Bro yall are cooked LUL
[1:37:09] bhoffey: rogue tank poggers
[1:37:09] billybeer181920: OMEGALUL VER THINKING
[1:37:10] A_Rodimus: then he needs tanked so he doesn't rack up ears
[1:37:11] mixtik123: Cant wait until yall find out he cant die lol. Hes nerfed for the event to be easier
[1:37:12] Ophelly: a demo specced lock can probably tank it with enough heals
[1:37:12] packtar: spelled backwards it is you mad bro (bro is in another language.
[1:37:15] Himaru7: xar tbh blizz never overthinked bosses with mechanics ever
[1:37:17] Tanov96: check the coodinates at 20,67 coz of 20% hp and 67mil @Xaryu
[1:37:17] ParfumAmerican: only with a warlock tank
[1:37:17] ExpectKhaos: !server
[1:37:17] Goosechaser101: Why would they want you to kill the boss? Doesn't that just ruin the STV event for the rest of the duration?
[1:37:17] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:37:18] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[1:37:19] orrenico: Maybe because people were using him to get more bloods/coins, and he was just killing everyone around him
[1:37:20] Tbiz87: can def tank with that GM buff lol
[1:37:20] Morphloo: hi
[1:37:20] Sillychops: spam target dummies so he doesnt kill players
[1:37:22] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Xaryu get tanks to keep aggro and healers for the tanks
[1:37:23] trolltrucked: trolltrucked subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! be on the lookout for wood department. they 100% are planning on trolling
[1:37:24] Pixiepantss: Sadge
[1:37:25] Vichrinox: im back to thinking its not killable
[1:37:25] dogsenses: what happend to your hair
[1:37:25] Knocktoff: @Xaryu I think that could be seen as a change so players don't get killed by him during the event, not necessarily to kill him
[1:37:27] flop: can I send you something on cord, it‚Äôs a wild theory
[1:37:27] Pillz_: @Xaryu will u fronteir?
[1:37:29] Wrenzoe: It will be interesting to see if his health pool changes this time at 20% with no GM
[1:37:29] hickey7979: @sinda1983 they nerfed oondasta pre release so ppl could get kills if they got a crazy amount of ppl together
[1:37:30] Riji07: 100% u just dont pump him there is an item or a place or certain spell
[1:37:30] roebinho7: we need to tank him like them did yesterday
[1:37:32] ARROOCE: @cookie_jayy you must be fun at parties LULW
[1:37:33] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:37:33] xNotMat: Plot twist: He drops level 60 items only
[1:37:33] PooksPooksPooks: are you doing it in a raid or in partys of 5
[1:37:34] AbramsBoy: if they didn‚Äôt want it to be killed, they‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not meant to because it‚Äôs not healthy for server connection‚Ä¶ imo
[1:37:35] mixtik123: Yeah
[1:37:36] Pillz_: @when will u fronteir?
[1:37:36] WilesDS: bro works at blizz
[1:37:37] Unfragged: KEKW
[1:37:38] EXiTxi: If it was meant to be killed at 60, wouldnt we just miss every hit?? @Xaryu
[1:37:39] burnitdown_leon: blizzard saw that no one tried the boss so they nerfed it @Xaryu
[1:37:39] Vichrinox: the nerf was just to help ppl in the event die less
[1:37:40] Fujinator: @Xaryu this feels more like a nerf for later level than for now, he basicaly 1 shots most people already
[1:37:42] ShingaTV: @zak618 ? he not even hits me for 1.6k as dps warlock... clearly tankable
[1:37:42] Kawayy: are you doing this in party or raid
[1:37:42] MongoSecurity: shaddup @flop KEKW
[1:37:43] M0rley_: I hope its all for nothing
[1:37:43] hidron99: BAN THE NONBELIEVERS
[1:37:44] Pixiepantss: Madge
[1:37:44] Himaru7: @Xaryu tbh blizz never overthinked on mechanics ever so it has to be a dps race
[1:37:47] Azulion: Honestly it'd be brilliant if he dropped cool loot because it'd bring people back at 60 to fight each other over tag
[1:37:47] Big_Zum: @xaryu he heals on kills. have 50 tanks around the arena continue to taunt to limit how many people he kills
[1:37:48] scoutbeans: is it possible to do this event normally while they try this kill? i just want my coins :(
[1:37:48] Metamorffozza: KEK
[1:37:48] shadwarform: Now it has 67M now 3M like yesterday. Idk
[1:37:49] skimansr: @xaryu what if you bring him to the arena?
[1:37:49] ParfumAmerican: any GM's in the chat?
[1:37:51] mellven: Bengal Tiger Mount Twitch Prime drop for SoD confirmed
[1:37:53] curedubs: NEGATIVE NANCYS
[1:37:53] realandtruephobe: Yeah there's a bunch of reddit trolls looking to get people going for boss
[1:37:53] stroobzbeats: its interesting though if it has a loot table and how that works crossfaction and without parties - @Xaryu
[1:37:53] conradical93: just because they nerfed his damage doesnt mean he is meant to be killed.  he may have just been 1 shotting too many STV event players
[1:37:54] qc3rs: @EXiTxi THIS
[1:37:57] Saligau: More Ears he has -> More health he gains at 20%
[1:37:57] Jehl703: @Xaryu  You need to kill him at 2am when the GMs are asleep and cant interfere
[1:37:58] gooshmagic12: I am a gm ingame zaryu
[1:37:58] ogkoop: we need a couple pvp groups that just kills the trollers
[1:38:01] gregfork: The Blood Craze was what happened when he hit 20% - everyone got a notification like "Kha'Damu enters a Blood Craze!"
[1:38:01] MENTALLY1MMUNE: how did guzu get him to 27%?
[1:38:03] Norcore: @Yamamoto78 isn't blood craze the buff he gets when he's on 20% hp? i doubt people take him that low during "normal events"
[1:38:03] roebinho7: we need to tank him like the gm yesterday
[1:38:05] Gamalimbo: Nah the nerfs came AFTER the reddit post of trying to kill the boss
[1:38:05] skerrzo: my daddy owns blizzard, he told me you cant kill it so gg go next
[1:38:06] chancerofl: @shadwarform no he doesn.t
[1:38:07] Vichrinox: @Himaru7 check out the lucid nightmare and riddlers mindword quest in retail
[1:38:07] Holy_chit187: kill each other when he gets to 20%
[1:38:08] WaDaFruCK: Maybe the hp buff he gets is based on # of ears? feed him less and he gets less max hp?
[1:38:09] BlackRe3per: @Xaryu we have to call for no AOE when fighting the boss
[1:38:10] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:38:11] flanney0403: @Xaryu gonna be dope when you get that linen and 2 silver
[1:38:12] qc3rs: if it's lvl 60 content we wouldn't get any hits on him right ?
[1:38:16] ogkoop: anyone who uses AOE gets focused
[1:38:17] shadowthehedgehog97: if they nerfed his dmg that just means he was punking people too hard. doesnt mean he can be kileld
[1:38:17] Eyedea808: Eyedea808 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! I'm a believer
[1:38:17] bondaru07: @Xaryu have u think about getting bloood and then opt out the event , the staks remain and u can make a raid
[1:38:22] 4wardsjack: having to wait until 60 sounds dumb. This is the phase 2 end game. 60 will have its own things to do
[1:38:23] BLUNDERGUN: good luck mages are assholes
[1:38:25] mixtik123: Just kill him and prove me wrong it good content tho
[1:38:26] bondaru07: @Xaryu have u think about getting bloood and then opt out the event , the staks remain and u can make a raid ??
[1:38:26] InsertYourseIf: YEP
[1:38:27] Hubbabubbamx: A bear might be able to tank it
[1:38:28] hickey7979: GL bro did u see payos stream he was getting hunted by everything
[1:38:28] kirk_hunts: We need a continuum transfunctioner.
[1:38:29] youwiththefeds: The less spell effects the better
[1:38:29] hayvex: No living flame?
[1:38:33] tangdill: kill them

[1:38:34] uwu2022: hit rating enchants
[1:38:35] Frostlicious: And you get World buffs KEK
[1:38:36] tangdill: kill the rogue
[1:38:36] Nivekpro: living bomb is single target
[1:38:36] bondaru07: @Xaryu have u think about getting bloood and then opt out the event , the staks remain and u can make a raid ???
[1:38:36] YzieGG: if they grief they dont get the mount ez
[1:38:37] Wrenzoe: @Xaryu does his health now start at 67m instead of 3m?
[1:38:38] Knocktoff: that just encourages the griefers to actually do it
[1:38:38] hickey7979: u prolly had a good 20% of pop just grief killing
[1:38:40] AleDoing: do we need HEALERS?
[1:38:40] realandtruephobe: @bondaru07 No. You lose all your stacks when you opt out
[1:38:43] ozzyxy: @Xaryu the bengal tiger drops from a bailamos snipe, so that's never happening.
[1:38:44] Skygan: I will come there and kill ya hehe
[1:38:45] Sillychops: target dummies yo
[1:38:47] ImSo1337: Make a bunch of groups that have 1 tank, 4 heals
[1:38:47] Mittens777: all the people telling u hes not suppose too die or dont try.. like do u know how too have fun?
[1:38:49] heyimtazz: i couldnt pala taunt him yesterday Xaryu
[1:38:50] Jay_io: Do a 5 ppl squad to punish people who dont follow those rules
[1:38:51] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^' Û†ÄÄ
[1:38:52] EXiTxi: @Xaryu , if it was meant for 60, we would miss every hit/cast.
[1:38:52] PooksPooksPooks: pain supression
[1:38:54] bvndxg_joe: @Xaryu is ret bad atm? just started playing sod.
[1:38:55] ninetysix: @Xaryu maybe at 20% if we all chatters spam prime subs we could kill him
[1:38:57] bondaru07: @whitewatersalvo are u sure?
[1:38:57] bamfosaurus: Make 5 1 tank 4 healer groups @Xaryu
[1:38:58] Himaru7: xar blizz never overthinked on mechanics ever so it has to be a dps race right
[1:38:58] mylittlehombre: no rogues
[1:38:59] saadoddy: u were living bombing last time
[1:39:00] kehayov: he has an abilty called blood leach which heals him from people that are near him , when he was in the middle of the arena the casters were far away and there were not many mele down in the arena and you guys melted him even without bloods
[1:39:00] tommygunz31: what if you guys need to talk to chromie, then go into the future and get the help from necrolord covenant
[1:39:02] rjhardy90: I heard that people think you might want to take the elixir that poisons you
[1:39:04] ShingaTV: yep
[1:39:06] realandtruephobe: @bondaru07 100% sure.
[1:39:07] poochypaunch: what layer dog?
[1:39:08] HelluvaWrecks: only people in group with tank could heal
[1:39:11] OpticProwle: how do you stop the boss heal
[1:39:11] YermGames: not true
[1:39:11] BeansAnToast: good point
[1:39:11] Ophelly: turning in bloods is basically making an offering to him, what if no one needs to turn in bloods at all
[1:39:12] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:39:12] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu I missed the first attempt today. Did we learn anything new today?
[1:39:12] meguidokun: lol facts there
[1:39:13] Saint_Vallion: thats true
[1:39:14] chancerofl: @bvndxg_joe why would he know?
[1:39:15] Shut_Up_Jack: kite him to the harbor - clearly
[1:39:15] ikkiweber: bro 2 GMs appeared so far ofc they are expecting us to kill him somehow
[1:39:15] Kenzu420: what IF we need blood imps......
[1:39:18] sal92mc06: Do you think it is possible to get  to 20% without reaching 250 stacks?
[1:39:18] DKNurs: does he get more health when you ress from the spirithealers?
[1:39:18] Nappycans: oh good point. was hitting him pretty hard yesterday
[1:39:18] tuttskie: hunter pet tanks won‚Äôt give stacks
[1:39:18] kswissbaby: lmao it‚Äôs def not meant for 60
[1:39:18] trolltrucked: priests run dome and pain sup
[1:39:19] saund: go to coordinates 20,67 on the STV map which were the health changes to boss, it brings you to shark near corsair cove, maybe the shark drops an item for killing blow if you have blood on you @Xaryu  Û†ÄÄ
[1:39:19] mylittlehombre: that‚Äôs true I said that as well
[1:39:19] Big_Zum: WE ARE GETTING THERE CHAT
[1:39:20] YermGames: we were damageing world boss at lvl 25
[1:39:20] BeansAnToast: BIG FACTS COMING IN
[1:39:22] Autumn_Hour: true NODDERS
[1:39:22] ShingaTV: ez clap :P
[1:39:23] astraldex: do we know why the GM took the boss to an altar?
[1:39:23] UltrawideGameGuy: Death Loa gains power from death. It's a dps check while not letting ANYONE die. Good luck!
[1:39:23] apexariestv: if you were to do it as a 40 man how would you?
[1:39:23] disar27: its not meant for 60 thats clear. they nerfed it. that is clear indication they know its this phase content
[1:39:24] letholdis: TRUE if this was scalled to kazzak we wouldnt be doing near the dmg
[1:39:24] orrenico: trueeee
[1:39:25] Tanov96: check the coodinates at 20,67 coz of 20% hp and 67mil @Xaryu  Û†ÄÄ
[1:39:26] Jansman: have no one ever killed the bloodmoon boss before?
[1:39:27] Muckbot1: what time?
[1:39:27] DankestDingus: real problem was mage griefers spamming AE
[1:39:29] disar27: its not meant for 60 thats clear. they nerfed it. that is clear indication they know its this phase content,.
[1:39:31] justinb_dmf: Why not ambush the boss twice since it does 50% of the bosses health?
[1:39:31] hickey7979: @ikkiweber 2?
[1:39:33] purplewingedboa: Is it possible that the boss has a relevant onhit effect that we haven't seen yet? Something that might show if a single tank keeps aggro long enough.
[1:39:35] largist_: it might be in phase 3, maybe you get something from Sunken Temple raid since it is also Loa based
[1:39:35] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:39:38] hutchyy917: RALLY THE TROOPS
[1:39:40] ParfumAmerican: is not for lvl 60 also not for a party - but 100% foir a raid
[1:39:41] disar27: its not meant for 60 thats clear. they nerfed it. that is clear indication they know its this phase content,../'
[1:39:42] carlphilip97: if everyone reroll hunter and just tank with ur pets and shot him donw!
[1:39:43] kehayov: he has an abilty called blood leach which heals him from people that are near him , when he was in the middle of the arena the casters were far away and there were not many mele down in the arena and you guys melted him even without bloods
[1:39:44] sdotpuff: True
[1:39:44] Holy_chit187: kill each other when he gets to 20%
[1:39:46] Norcore: what's weird to me is how they just nerfed it recently even though I don't know of anyone else who even taken him down that low HP.
[1:39:47] Wrenzoe: @Xaryu If his health starts at 64M this time instead of 3M there is no way
[1:39:49] Riji07: maybe somehting with a shaman and a paladin hordes alliance working togehter?
[1:39:51] Peschke9: make your SSF character rq
[1:39:52] SatanicAngelBlazed: recruit in cities, get moar peeps
[1:39:53] BlackRe3per: @Xaryu thought it was happening at the 3pm event?
[1:39:56] Gamalimbo: If blizzard didn't want us to kill it. They would make him immune after the GM's has shown up. @Xaryu
[1:39:57] curedubs: its a blue mount so not for 60 60% mount
[1:39:57] bondaru07: can u call somebody from blizz and give a hint ...a location ..something
[1:39:57] gooshmagic12: @xaryu maybe kite him to rebel camp or zg isles's
[1:40:00] Redhed_Iou: maybe it's for level 50
[1:40:02] Argartv: IF
[1:40:08] sinda1983: sinda1983 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:40:08] realandtruephobe: Bro the way that dev smiled there HAS to be a way to kill boss. Even if he has no loot
[1:40:09] burnitdown_leon: blizzard saw that no one tried the boss so they nerfed it
[1:40:13] Holy_chit187: @ xaryu kill each other when he gets to 20%
[1:40:15] BLUNDERGUN: people will do it for ab rep alone 100%
[1:40:16] RebornOG: why nerf it then
[1:40:20] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^' Û†ÄÄ
[1:40:20] Geleff: The fact that you previously made a solid attempt, means there's no way it's a level 60 boss - Look at other lvl 60 world bosses, they would completely onetap all of you. This is def a killable lvl 40 world boss.
[1:40:20] kswissbaby: they‚Äôll prob upgrade the rewards from Coins
[1:40:21] sal92mc06: Do you think it is possible to get to 20% without reaching 250 stacks? Can we have groups with 1 tank + 4 healers to minimize deaths? Melee should just stay away/behind the boss so they don't get cleaved?
[1:40:22] bondaru07: @Xaryu call somebody from bliz to give us a hint ,a location ,something
[1:40:23] pheigngaming: I think just try to have the least amount of people die as possible so when he hits 20% he doesn't get 60 million ho.
[1:40:23] Knocktoff: the nerf doesnt indicate you can kill it at all, it just stops people from being killed while fighting around him ...
[1:40:25] Tbiz87: i think if the severs stay up, yall got it
[1:40:26] kswissbaby: to get people to come back
[1:40:26] pheigngaming: Hp*
[1:40:26] Saint_Vallion: KEKW
[1:40:27] Baeta: ‚Äúthis phase‚Äôs content‚Äù LUL an event that needs 200 people to organize and kill.
[1:40:29] curedubs: its a blue mount so not for 60 60% mount Û†ÄÄ
[1:40:29] baldanduseless: or just keep the idea and move it zone to zone ? @Xaryu eastern plaguelands is perfect
[1:40:31] hrod1life: If tank never dies and ur pounding his ass the whole time u can do it SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:40:33] PMA_1: there is more mounts
[1:40:33] Yamamoto78: @Knocktoff exactly
[1:40:34] Zermat146: they could add new rewards for coins at 50 and 60 @Xaryu
[1:40:36] NericoTV: rep
[1:40:37] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: rep, yeah
[1:40:37] Lucons1: but your abilities dont miss
[1:40:37] xNotorietyx: alts do
[1:40:38] BLUNDERGUN: once a week for 1 npc KEKW
[1:40:38] xqooq: why its hard to enter raid as a mele ?
[1:40:38] Norcore: @RebornOG cause we are still 40. they could buff it again in 3 months, why not?
[1:40:38] Dancheek: honor
[1:40:40] MongoSecurity: What if you /dance with the blood god? BUT hear me out, everyone has to get naked and then dance to show you really mean it.
[1:40:40] x_jdot: WSG rep 1k/week
[1:40:43] froggera: im here right now KEKW
[1:40:43] SavageSeb_: They can still upscale the Boss at 60 then.
[1:40:43] mixtik123: Hes not supposed to die your fueling this copium for content but hey i rea!ly like it good content i like conspiracy theory
[1:40:44] Lucons1: abilitites dont miss though
[1:40:45] Wew_lad_: it takes the whole 30 minutes to kill the boss so that weould completely ruin the pvp aspect of the event
[1:40:45] pmanfit91: @Xaryu Remember. Aggrend saw everything yesterday. His silence means more than anything he could say. He wants to see us do this.
[1:40:45] Nize2: theres also trade coins for honor/ab rep
[1:40:47] Kuja_: and you can buy honor
[1:40:48] froggera: in ashenvale
[1:40:48] linsenchips: Ashenvale is done more then ever atm
[1:40:48] nistaux: at level 60 it can be 5 man content to kill it. at this phase it is a mass server event
[1:40:48] PMA_1: STV mounts in general
[1:40:50] NericoTV: 250 honor per 25 coins
[1:40:50] zartuus: if the drop is low enought they will come backl at lvl 60
[1:40:50] KIILLINIT: Imagine riding a giant troll mount
[1:40:51] Sillychops: maybe everyone needs to put their sleeping bag down so he falls asleep
[1:40:51] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Xaryu his health gain at 20% could have a cap at 255 ears, so under 255 might lower the health gained
[1:40:52] disar27: whyt would they nerf it now then if its not meant to die now? they would just let him be OP and nerf *if needed* at 60
[1:40:53] Rimasa: and the honor for free
[1:40:54] taylorsdank: if it‚Äôs meant for lvl 60 you just need more lvl 40‚Äôs
[1:40:54] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Xaryu his health gain at 20% could have a cap at 255 ears, so under 255 might lower the health gained.
[1:40:54] RebornOG: @Norcore so just nerf it for no reason to buff it again ? ok
[1:40:55] Big_Zum: the 1% bag drop would be sick
[1:40:55] afk_rudy: they should do this with every zone outside of starter zones, to keep engagement everywhere. like Guild Wars 2
[1:40:58] adam_brisbane: ashenvale normally has 2 raids for each faction each event
[1:41:01] karl__hungus: just fix the dang lag
[1:41:01] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:41:03] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Xaryu his health gain at 20% could have a cap at 255 ears, so under 255 might lower the health gained!
[1:41:04] greenmanalpha: If its a normal mount it will not be that much incentive
[1:41:08] Rimasa: when u need to get to rank 14 people would go for honor for 25 copper coins
[1:41:09] chancerofl: chancerofl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! At 20% he has more HP than any naxx boss. I don't think its made for level 60, I think we are just missing some tech.
[1:41:09] teejway__: arent we also expecting new pvp events for 50 and 60?
[1:41:10] sangcti: is falling/fallen rip?
[1:41:10] mixtik123: Lmao
[1:41:11] croutomz: @pmanfit91 thats a great point
[1:41:11] yaybump: @ xaryu if we wern't meant to down him. they wwouldnt nerf it. Also if we can hit it, then its meant to be downed this phase. WE MUST DOWN HIM!! HORDE AND ALLY TOGETHER
[1:41:12] Boruox: Try 3 tanks with 4 healers each!?
[1:41:13] kswissbaby: lmao no way
[1:41:16] Norcore: @RebornOG wdym "for no reason"? do you not see how tanky and ahrd hitting he is? OMEGALUL
[1:41:17] BlackRe3per: @Xaryu thought it was happening at the 3pm event? Û†ÄÄ
[1:41:18] DankestDingus: DankestDingus subscribed with Prime. 
[1:41:20] curedubs: i dont want 60% mount at 60
[1:41:20] cookie_jayy: or, they nerfed him because during the event when people stood around him to get the buff they just died too fast
[1:41:22] FatherOwens: what reputation does the loa give?
[1:41:22] kirin_ilya: @Xaryu yeah, then 5 60-th can keep 40-th freely
[1:41:23] kiffa49: blizzard hasn‚Äôt made an S tier decision in 14 years. this seems way to cool for blizzard to make tbh lol
[1:41:25] skoobss: you gotta believe man
[1:41:26] mcsnuffyfluffy: mcsnuffyfluffy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Thanks for being awesome
[1:41:27] mixtik123: Yall lost in the sauce
[1:41:29] GuperGER: I had to go for an hour, did i miss something already? when does the event start? @Xaryu @chat
[1:41:29] adam90k: I tihnk you had too many people yesterday
[1:41:30] WilesDS: lolwat
[1:41:33] packtar: people are still trying to get 1% mount drops years after
[1:41:33] bealtaos: bealtaos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:41:35] WilesDS: def killable at 60
[1:41:35] justinb_dmf: hes here during phase 2, hes for phase 2.
[1:41:36] caypr: @Xaryu any mobs in STV specifically trolls that you can mind control for a debuff? Û†ÄÄ
[1:41:37] jvizzey: definitely tech.
[1:41:37] WilesDS: lmaoooooo
[1:41:37] Graycen: you see the potions i linked in dcord
[1:41:40] wyrmboi: @chat does he spawn with 67 mil hp now? only saw stream yesterday
[1:41:41] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: maybe a gm could kill it
[1:41:42] DankestDingus: the only tech i need is to PUMP HARDER
[1:41:42] bhoffey: tech decks?
[1:41:44] ParfumAmerican: some kind of offerings for the a LOA
[1:41:45] billybeer181920: were doing more dps then we did in MC already
[1:41:45] fuming_bumblebee: yo @Xaryu can you let us know what layer you all do, so I can be on a diff layer TY
[1:41:47] Moose_Ka: Maybe you have to drag him to all the blood altars on the map
[1:41:47] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:41:47] letholdis: also most ppl dont have gnomer gear so we may be undergeared? @Xaryu
[1:41:50] jbroni: doesn‚Äôt killing it kind of defeat the purpose of the event, then everyone would rather not turn in blood and not kill each other so they can kill the boss?
[1:41:50] delitaa1: @xaryu use all your marbles so he can't hit anyone
[1:41:50] Trajic: graycen!
[1:41:51] mixtik123: No tech no kill. Copium
[1:41:53] curedubs: why do people say tech in WoW
[1:41:54] TheCraigJr: @xaryu im telling you altar at Yojamba
[1:41:55] Degran: Did anyone try to disarm him? He's constantly saying "My blade thirsts" around the time he heals.
[1:41:57] skimansr: bring to ARENA @Xaryu
[1:41:57] Ervill1: most boring take: he literally isnt meant to be killed, just part of the event
[1:41:57] sergogg95: @Graycen when online
[1:41:57] hollywoodxJ: CALL THE DISCORD!
[1:41:58] sinda1983: but a lvl60 worldboss right now you would get all the time miss and resists. he is hitable
[1:41:58] Baeta: tech is he‚Äôs not meant to be killed. LUL
[1:41:59] gusbillat: call blizz LUL
[1:41:59] Panchen1290: @Xaryu antihealing poisons and mortal strike?
[1:42:00] letholdis: we arent full raid geared?
[1:42:00] Frizankbeast: Can people please stop overthinkking this. There is no secret behind it. Just stop.
[1:42:02] bartallos: yes it can be like a world boss with interesting drops
[1:42:02] FatherOwens: Hes not killable
[1:42:03] unsteddy: He heals based off ears. At 60 he wont get 250... so he wont scale that hard
[1:42:04] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^' Û†ÄÄ
[1:42:04] baldanduseless: did you try building catapults with the stv lumber? @Xaryu
[1:42:04] zaxal_: maybe something to do with blood stacks on players
[1:42:05] astraldex: @Xaryu do we know why the GM took the boss to an altar?
[1:42:05] Unfragged: mass dispells on boss at 20%?
[1:42:06] Morkaa: Go onto WoWhead and find the NPC. Look at all his spells
[1:42:07] cookie_jayy: @curedubs technique
[1:42:10] Big_Zum: @xaryu I want to say it‚Äôs limit deaths and just zugzug the boss
[1:42:10] TKoNoR: blood moon weapons perhaps ?
[1:42:11] encrypteddeath: what about if people that are bruised doesn't come and fight the boss again?
[1:42:12] TheCraigJr: @xaryu no one has tried the altar, it has runs that are red around it.
[1:42:13] FatherOwens: Could it be as simple as "not killable"
[1:42:13] apexariestv: what is in the middle of all his spawn points?
[1:42:15] Jehl703: @Xaryu I think he gains life based on how many kills he gets. So if less people died he wont gain as much and it'd be easier to burst him down
[1:42:16] madamedog: @Xaryu just need a shrink ray duh
[1:42:20] trolltrucked: priests rotating pain sup and domes on tanks.
[1:42:23] ShingaTV: because you guys wantet too
[1:42:24] dumpdeer: you were saying bring the boss to the alter
[1:42:24] curedubs: @cookie_jayy strat > tech
[1:42:24] Knocktoff: to show that its not the solution
[1:42:25] bhoffey: GM trying to tell us something
[1:42:27] 13brill: You can hit the boss, its not a 60
[1:42:27] sailias83: how do 9 raid groups loot a boss?
[1:42:27] juice42069: TO DROP BLOODS AT 20%
[1:42:28] BlackRe3per: to make everyone drop their bloods
[1:42:29] slimeuruuu: GM was just doing your suggestions I think
[1:42:31] Norcore: the GM took threat and dragged him to ZG entrance altar
[1:42:32] flawlace: to show you it didnt work
[1:42:32] Tauree25: The GM probably has no idea either
[1:42:33] mixtik123: Call blizzard
[1:42:33] TrapCD: Maybe he takes dmg everytime someone brings in blood at the altar Xaryu
[1:42:33] chilemangx: @Xaryu it would be cool if they never had the intention of the boss dying, but now since players are trying to kill him they add the ability to kill  him and give him loot.
[1:42:33] TMMOOF: That's what you were trying to do too right? so just trying to help?
[1:42:33] TerrortheToast: he only stood there, didnt he?
[1:42:34] jojoshambho: @xaryu if GM took boss to altar, maybe 100-20% u need bloods. At 20% everyone turn in blood and kill him that way?
[1:42:35] YaBoy_Lijah: it looked like GM was taking him to ZG, not altar @Xaryu
[1:42:37] iPlayCuzFun: is there a clip of that?
[1:42:37] cutexlol_: could be random
[1:42:38] Cooof: @Xaryu want a crazy theory? so think about it like this. What if you needed to use some sort of mechanic from ZG? I feel like the theory with the hakkar blood is somewhere there
[1:42:39] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: blood turn ins might lower the enrage?
[1:42:40] Panchen1290: @Xaryu maybe turn's in bloods in the altar?
[1:42:40] Khaidin: to see mayham lol
[1:42:41] jackcousteau: On the first attempt it got chunked to 50% ‚Äî potentially horde turning in bloods
[1:42:41] Ophelly: turning blood is making an offering to the blood loa, people should try to not turn in blood and actually keep him far away from it
[1:42:42] thedaestra: @Xaryu I think we should be asking more about what GM  was doing and why they were there
[1:42:42] arieuh: bring him to the arena and done
[1:42:42] Himaru7: @Xaryu GMs probably dont know the design appartment decissions either
[1:42:44] isseswagger: what boss? what have I missed?
[1:42:44] ricktickticcow: Can you go over the replay from yesterday @Xaryu
[1:42:44] UltrawideGameGuy: That tablet said Praying would help - altar?
[1:42:44] juice42069: DROP BLOOD 20%
[1:42:45] Psico_420: Because you guys were telling ppl to taunt the boss to the altar
[1:42:45] discommm: Have they figured out why we get lore white weapons in SM
[1:42:47] bojack359: Didn't the gm sqy something
[1:42:48] wramel: I thought maybe it had something to do with the boss turning in the ears
[1:42:48] iRambo96: @Xaryu what potion was it>
[1:42:49] taylorsdank: it has to be the blood offering
[1:42:49] SailazarAY: what if u turn in the blood while he is next to the author?!
[1:42:49] Bhimasena: You did want to move him to the alter and gm is a streamsniper
[1:42:50] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:42:50] tick1en1pple: Just tuning in - how do you know he taunted it there?
[1:42:51] Baeta: because you guys asked someone to bring boss to altar to see what would happen.
[1:42:51] NGianga: what if everyone turns in their blood when he gets there
[1:42:51] MightyCactus1: GM coulda been trolling or showing strat didnt work tho too
[1:42:51] kiffa49: did he though?
[1:42:52] K3tchup_33: maybe everyone has to be IN the arena floor not outside on the stands
[1:42:53] PooksPooksPooks: who gets the kill though if there are multiple raids trying to kill him
[1:42:53] simplegeoffy: TO help or to hinder?
[1:42:53] Tanov96: rewatch the vod again
[1:42:53] MrPoulpp: Maybe the boss need to be tank on the altar?
[1:42:53] bartallos: maybe you need to sacrifice him
[1:42:54] arieuh: take him to the arena
[1:42:54] TMMOOF: yee drop blood 20% is a good guess
[1:42:55] hrod1life: U gotta offer the blood guy to the blood gods up above
[1:42:56] grandstrumph: Maybe more damaage on altar ? Like a sacrifice ? @Xaryu
[1:42:58] FrennLaugh: you need to make a sacrifice
[1:42:58] Bahood: probably a safe assumption that the altar helps in some way. like extra blood or even being able to down it at all.
[1:42:59] 444xtina: the literal only hint they said had something to do with altar
[1:42:59] amruta_ray: maybe sacrifice player when boss is near the altar
[1:43:00] kiffa49: like , did he though?
[1:43:01] Joxtirol: because you guys scream it they did what you want
[1:43:01] acaman: @Xaryu maybe the altar has to do withe boss healing itself?
[1:43:01] SuperLost89: @Xaryu i would really try the arena again
[1:43:03] kraztez: maybe the boss loses stacks if people hand in bloods
[1:43:04] justinb_dmf: What if you need to take the boss around the map to every alter, however the last alter should be the arena?
[1:43:04] Kritisk: Might be any altar, just the one where he spawns closest to @Xaryu
[1:43:06] tick1en1pple: Just tuning in - how do you know he taunted it there??
[1:43:06] sinsin935: maybe you damage boss by turning in irradiated blood?
[1:43:06] kiffa49: or coincidence
[1:43:06] TrapCD: Maybe he takes dmg everytime someone brings in blood at the altar? Xaryu
[1:43:07] gnarrrcody: like the haircut man
[1:43:07] BreezeEUW: @Xaryu can he be kited out of STV
[1:43:10] tuttskie: what if the altar drops the bosses stacks
[1:43:10] maruus1: Can the ZG guards get aggro cause Khadamu Cleaves and they hhelp kill the boss?
[1:43:11] TheCraigJr: @xaryu we need to try yojamba altar. THERE ARE RUNES AROUND IT THAT ARE RED!
[1:43:12] Parametik: is this some aztec shit he wants you to sacrifice yourself on the altar
[1:43:12] awfulist: or trying to get you all to turn your bloods in at 20%
[1:43:14] RockstarPunched: mybe u get a alot of blood for killing it
[1:43:14] swidey221: @xaryu everyone needs to stack on altar at 20% and sacrifice themselves to the boss to quench the frenzy
[1:43:15] rourfoses: yeah u give him so much blood that he gets a tummy ache and dies
[1:43:15] Carepai: a raging clue
[1:43:17] esSaRre: Could be the altars are supposed to give it some buff/debuff and he was testing it
[1:43:17] blaaaaakee: wowhead does say it encourages people to fight around him because it gives more blood
[1:43:17] centur77: take him closer to the grave site shorter death's walk
[1:43:18] AppleJaxZzz: when he kills u...u cant get blood when others kill u...u lose blood. I think u will need blood to kill him as much as possible...drop all blood at 20%
[1:43:19] dalmationx: Sacrifice 100 gnomes.  Works half the time, every time.
[1:43:19] rawlexdota: What happens if he heals back over 21%
[1:43:21] Envoy04: The GM was absolutely giving a hint...
[1:43:22] iRambo96: whats the potion called?
[1:43:23] cmilly1025: You all were kicking around ideas and that was one of them mentioned but how to use the blood altar
[1:43:25] OneAndOnlyAron: I personally think the GM was just trying to ensure the boss didn't reset with the server issues
[1:43:26] curedubs: @xaryu if mobs dont despawn on yojamba then its safe to bet they could attack boss during event
[1:43:27] hrod1life: Yea take him to zg and let mobs attack him
[1:43:27] peppep330: is this what classic used to be like before forums/streaming/etc. ?(regarding the theory crafting)
[1:43:27] lizardboiy: isn't there some island that says stuff about how you should kill him with your friends
[1:43:28] heyimtazz: I feel like the GM was holding aggro so if the server crashed the boss wouldnt reset
[1:43:29] dumpdeer: maybe we all have to turn our blood in at 20%
[1:43:29] DanRas08: What happens if you attack the boss with the buff that protects you from the event?
[1:43:29] cookie_jayy: just /deul the boss GG
[1:43:30] QWOT: maybe turning in bloods at 20% removes the amount of stacks he currently has
[1:43:30] jstuwie: THE AREAN IS WHERE THE GM MSG
[1:43:31] TMMOOF: that's gonna look so badass
[1:43:32] stroobzbeats: @Xaryu what about kiting to Booty Bay?
[1:43:32] hickey7979: gms dont usually interact like that unless something was suppose to happen one way and wasnt etc.. theyd do that do a live fix to my understanding
[1:43:33] ScryerTV: arena bis + biggest altar
[1:43:35] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: definitely more epic
[1:43:37] youwiththefeds: The NPC at the arena is the only event NPC, might be legit involved in the kill
[1:43:38] Vio9: we still trying to kill the boss? KEKW
[1:43:38] r0nin_xd: mannn, if the GM is going to spawn and taunt the boss, then they can do something about the fly hacking lmao
[1:43:38] leechko: !server
[1:43:39] Injekce: when SF start on EU?
[1:43:39] CeGe9: Obviously take him to ZG so Hakkar can purge his ass
[1:43:39] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[1:43:39] packtar: depending on the spawn point
[1:43:43] gnarrrcody: i like the haircut man
[1:43:44] iRambo96: Chat: what potion are they talking about?
[1:43:46] wampyyr: Guys HC SSF start today?
[1:43:46] SatanicAngelBlazed: kill him faster and die less lol
[1:43:48] cookie_jayy: Duel the boss, living flame and iceblock GG
[1:43:50] PineappleDuh: I think the GMs are going to prevent a zerg strat, I think there is tech and we have to find it
[1:43:50] Arckke: The secret tech is. Kite him to storm wind and see what happens
[1:43:50] justinb_dmf: Bring him to every alter? or booty bay?
[1:43:55] gnated: you dont have to
[1:43:55] Injekce: when SSF start on eu?
[1:43:56] ze_puncho: not all ranged don't get on the outside
[1:43:58] THEBUSHYHEAD: What if Hunters are the key. Blizzard keeps Nerfing them because they knew they were the secret to killing the boss.
[1:43:58] hickey7979: if the gm wanted u guys to kill it bro coulda just deleted it
[1:43:59] Kryptiiq: Not worth
[1:44:00] jamesdeanhaircut: people getting ported to old walljum√•ing spots, pull him to uninstanced ZG
[1:44:00] TrapCD: Maybe he takes dmg everytime someone brings in blood at the altar? Xaryu
[1:44:01] gnated: that doesnt make sense
[1:44:01] Odezq: @Xaryu its not a one event thing for sure, since reward is atleast 1gold token (mount) for everyone, u need to get bloods in one event then come next event with bloods (not turned) to full dps, u cant let him bruise too many guys
[1:44:01] realandtruephobe: It's a waste of time kiting him imo
[1:44:03] amruta_ray: you need to kill a player when the boss is near an altar
[1:44:03] shalomski: Don't use living bomb or flame also
[1:44:03] pizac7: not worth
[1:44:04] DrSitrus: i think the gm was stalling until today, was a patch this morning and now hes killable. They prob didnt have any loot for him yet
[1:44:04] ShingaTV: -
[1:44:05] fake_based: @Xaryu I bet there is an item in sunken temple we need
[1:44:07] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:44:07] ExpectKhaos: nope, not worth
[1:44:08] Buttsoap: not enough dps
[1:44:09] sal92mc06: No, time is important
[1:44:09] 13brill: Why would kiting be a mechanic
[1:44:09] skimansr: SOMETIMES HE SPAWNS NEARBY
[1:44:10] Parametik: it has to be related to the altars
[1:44:12] Kenzu420: @Xaryu waht if he can only be killed at MIDNIGHT......
[1:44:12] Panchen1290: I think he spawns in the arena
[1:44:12] Zerksyera: not owrth it, Just start pumpin
[1:44:15] dumpdeer: what happens when we turn the coins in when he's on the alter at 20%?
[1:44:16] morfius09: if he spawns close take it, if not just try to burn it
[1:44:16] sal92mc06: just kill where it spawns imo
[1:44:17] SailazarAY: what about the first GM comment? I believe there is a hint there
[1:44:17] Granteater4: Must be he enrages for blood, you turn your bloods in to calm him down
[1:44:17] PooksPooksPooks: maybe you need to drag him to all of the altars
[1:44:18] koldhanded: i think its better to protect casters and melee in the back and move the boss to the alter where the gm took the boss
[1:44:18] DrSitrus: Speculation ofc
[1:44:18] hickey7979: @DrSitrus 0% chance
[1:44:19] slimeuruuu: You cant enter the arena without turning in your blood
[1:44:20] TerrortheToast: a warlock tank with 3-4 pocket heals would be perfect. a ranged tank that can pull him up and down the stairs
[1:44:21] pizac7: plus the altar is in the way people will end up turning in bloods
[1:44:21] JustChoDaddy: where is your fucking lid
[1:44:21] kharma99: BUTTSOAP
[1:44:22] vliraaz: !drops
[1:44:23] StreamElements: Xaryu has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the reward. Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[1:44:23] deathofd00m: You already figured out some part of it is based on u needing to have blood. Maybe another part is connected to the altar. Maybe 1 altar needs to be "full" and he needs to be there?
[1:44:24] wubbawub32: He's meant to be killed where he spawns (or rather, CAN be killed anywhere he spawns)
[1:44:24] realandtruephobe: ST is Phase 3 raid?
[1:44:25] ricktickticcow: Random spawns would suggest that whatever the mechanic is, it can be killed anywhere.
[1:44:26] kehayov: READ THIS : LOOK AT HIS ABILITY BLOOD LEACH ON WOWHEAD
[1:44:26] kiffa49: moving while dosing though
[1:44:26] absolutdarkn3ss19x2: im horde and my guid is down to help
[1:44:26] iRambo96: What potion are they talking about using?
[1:44:27] gnated: there is no boss you have to kite that far in classic
[1:44:28] Saturos47: @XARYU i say just brute force it first try, use all 30 mins and max dmg
[1:44:30] Big_Zum: @xaryu if boss spawns at ZG could have range on the hill sides of the ramp up to ZG and tanks on the ramp
[1:44:30] mungas1: it should be able to be killed at any location it spawns
[1:44:30] AppleJaxZzz: when he kills u...u cant get blood when others kill u...u lose blood. I think u will need blood to kill him as much as possible...drop all blood at 20%. He always near an alter
[1:44:31] gh00775: just gotta pump dps
[1:44:32] kirk_hunts: https://clips.twitch.tv/SmellyTawdryParrotUncleNox-ZFkXf0k6mjz8souY
[1:44:34] Pixiepantss: guzu tried to kill him and couldnt
[1:44:35] MalwareBaby: Maybe take him to the shore where the Naga temples are
[1:44:38] apexariestv: will npcs attack him?
[1:44:39] Injekce: when SSF start on EU? anyoneknows?
[1:44:39] PaperbackWritter: yeah, no way you'll need to move it that far
[1:44:40] hrod1life: Taking boss anywhere not gonna do anything
[1:44:41] kiffa49: can move and dps
[1:44:46] Kenzu420: @Xaryu maybe he is meant to be killed at MIDNIGHT since he is the weakest....
[1:44:49] MicroChaotic: @Xaryu What if we just ignore him completely and give him 0 bloods for like 20 min
[1:44:51] Degran: Yeah
[1:44:52] Seithr9: yes
[1:44:52] Yamamoto78: yes
[1:44:52] realandtruephobe: I agree with that poster. Lets just see how much dmg we can do with a ton of ppl
[1:44:52] lightninfury: YEAH
[1:44:53] PROPANIAC: yea
[1:44:53] forceflexx1122: yeah it was
[1:44:53] Ervill1: if no one trolls and uses aoe its doable
[1:44:54] cookie_jayy: yes
[1:44:54] Exxii11: yes
[1:44:55] TokerTy420: ouuu
[1:44:55] Vylltv: ya
[1:44:55] Rainey719: tes
[1:44:55] wampyyr: @Xaryu Classic HC SF start today?
[1:44:55] Moronomics: was ye
[1:44:56] OnkelRunkle: yess
[1:44:56] Morkaa: Yes
[1:44:56] boomy5g: yes
[1:44:57] rourfoses: yes
[1:44:57] RealTy_Guy: yes
[1:44:57] empyreaNw0w: Yes it was
[1:44:57] istinklikepoop69: when is 100% xp buff live?
[1:44:57] CitizenDesmond: ya
[1:44:57] curedubs: yep
[1:44:58] OGSceneBoy: yes
[1:44:59] TerrortheToast: a warlock tank with 3-4 pocket heals would be perfect. a ranged tank that can pull him up and down the stairs
[1:44:59] soosh02: Yo does gnomergon have a reset timer or is it spammable?
[1:44:59] elementzia: yes
[1:45:00] ScottyUSMC: always there
[1:45:00] CitizenDesmond: pretty sure it was
[1:45:01] forceflexx1122: i remember seeing it as a kid in like 2004 lol
[1:45:01] Phrosted_: kite the boss to GZ
[1:45:02] seenofish: yee
[1:45:03] elementzia: thats the Bengal model
[1:45:03] kirk_hunts: I guess I am too
[1:45:04] TrapCD: Maybe he takes dmg everytime someone brings in blood at the altar and thats why he always spawn close to an altar? Xaryu
[1:45:04] wahedje: why would the killing spot even matter if it has multiple spawn locations?
[1:45:05] kehayov: LOOK AT HIS ABILITY BLOOD LEACH ON WOWHEAD
[1:45:07] kirk_hunts: ok lol
[1:45:08] askinforit: it was
[1:45:13] cookie_jayy: i bet its not even in this phase LUL
[1:45:14] moka_master: ohhhhh you have to kite the boss to gadget thats it ;))
[1:45:15] OnkelRunkle: yeah i always wanted that as a kid aswell
[1:45:15] kharma99: @Phrosted_ KITE BOSS TO GRATS?
[1:45:16] SatanicAngelBlazed: does he gain health from deaths or is it once he hits 20%?
[1:45:16] deathofd00m: You figured out some part of it is based on u needing blood. Another logical part is the altars. Maybe 1 altar needs to be "filled" with blood for something to happen?
[1:45:17] Dylanooooo: 100% always there. Crazy the REACH right now lol
[1:45:18] duanew75: maybe it matters where he spawns???
[1:45:18] Hexx_E: maybe the guards front altar will be responsive during the event... maybe they help
[1:45:20] Panchen1290: @Xaryu isn't there a way to kite it like you kite mobs as a mage in stockades?
[1:45:25] Knocktoff: aggrend is trolling on twitter, i really dont think its killable
[1:45:26] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^' Û†ÄÄ
[1:45:29] Jehl703: They just didnt turn in enough bloods
[1:45:29] vliraaz: !drops
[1:45:30] StreamElements: Xaryu has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the reward. Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[1:45:31] Jehl703: more blood
[1:45:32] tuttskie: what if boss has to hit the alter to drop his stacks
[1:45:32] taylorsdank: they didn‚Äôt do enough or both factions have to
[1:45:34] SuperLost89: at the arena?
[1:45:37] Philopinos: EU killed boss, nothing happend
[1:45:38] dreamreamer: Its ears boys not blood
[1:45:39] justinb_dmf: What if you need MORE bloods?
[1:45:39] realandtruephobe: Maybe not enough blood, but it didn't help us
[1:45:40] hrod1life: Kill him close to an altar only thing I can think of
[1:45:40] Ophelly: turning blood is basically offering the blood to him, it would make more sense that it buffs him
[1:45:41] theclusher: @Xaryu does the boss heal next to the alter?
[1:45:41] wahedje: why would the killing spot even matter if it has multiple spawn locations?
[1:45:44] swidey221: turn in bloods but stay on altar
[1:45:44] curedubs: pics?
[1:45:44] Skry667: This is nice to "Discover" the mechanics
[1:45:45] Grillelise: @xaryu in how long is the event? I might need to go but i want to come back at event üôè
[1:45:47] Injekce: eu SSF start at 10pm?
[1:45:48] flanney0403: take him to the altar at 20%
[1:45:48] HelluvaWrecks: any vod of that?
[1:45:49] ScryerTV: Brute force pog
[1:45:52] halberg_: maybe you could have killed him if the servers didn't get cooked
[1:45:54] tuttskie: he spawns near alters for a reason
[1:45:55] blaise_pmk: when are you going for Blood today?
[1:45:55] NotASkiller: I watched a streamer named Buttsoap and he was lagging all day. This game is so bad. I've never seen him lag on retail. Just saying.
[1:45:56] unclegez: did the bosses hp go up at 20% with the other group ?
[1:46:01] ripwarlock2: @Xaryu I'm looking at old picture and its a white tiger not a bengal tiger in gadgeztan
[1:46:02] ThePlayerCoachStun: start building groups now then
[1:46:03] Corndogman: I personally think you just need to kill the boss not too many people that the server lags but enough to kill the boss
[1:46:04] Parametik: what about the ghosts? whgen ur dead is there aq debuff that you get thatll give you another prompt?
[1:46:05] SatanicAngelBlazed: keep his ears low imo
[1:46:05] Tangents92: R A I L
[1:46:05] ddevillax: rail HUH
[1:46:05] astradas: STOP LAGGING THE HARDCORE SERVERS
[1:46:05] seenofish: put max stacks on boss? give him 255 ears?
[1:46:06] Yamamoto78: im not sure what the expression is, but looking to deep into it...if there is a pred im going all in on his hp stops going down at 1
[1:46:07] lylo_tv: HUH
[1:46:07] AbyssReborn: mudd hutters will grief
[1:46:09] fake_based: @Xaryu sunken temple likely the last raid. it is based on hakkar the blood god i bet you need an item from it
[1:46:10] PaperbackWritter: did the boss got to 67M hp last night too?
[1:46:10] IuckyIee: im talking to my contacts at echo will let you know the strat soon Kappa
[1:46:11] TMMOOF: Do you think we could summon another Loa somehow? Loa v Loa deathmatch
[1:46:12] agixtated: going for noon?
[1:46:13] lylo_tv: HUH Ream the boss?
[1:46:13] RiverK1ngPoker: what if you do more damage to him based on how many blood stacks you have.
[1:46:14] hickey7979: did eu kill boss?
[1:46:14] pydda1: @NotASkiller loool
[1:46:14] EXiTxi: Any reason we dont raid group after getting blood?
[1:46:15] Dylanooooo: PVE spec for a pvp event. Sounds spot on
[1:46:15] dr_g_ttv: I just asked blizzard, you need to kite him onto the boat at booty bay, and send him sailing to ratchet
[1:46:17] Wrenzoe: too many mages spamming arcane explosions yesterday
[1:46:18] EqWallyT: do you think it has anything to do with the "String of ears" he has ?
[1:46:18] 1710gandalf: Shamrock100 soniiCook soniiCook
[1:46:18] realandtruephobe: But opted into the event, with some bloods each
[1:46:19] PineappleDuh: I think GMs are going to interfere with a brute force attempt, i think there is tech they want us to find
[1:46:20] AppleJaxZzz: the GM took him to the alter tho...like theres a reason for ti
[1:46:25] Skry667: no lag LUL
[1:46:26] Saiauriel: You are guilty sir CaughtIn4K
[1:46:27] wahedje: why would the killing spot even matter if it has multiple spawn locations?
[1:46:27] theclusher: @Xaryu single target build then
[1:46:30] FrennLaugh: sacrifice someone on the altar
[1:46:33] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^'
[1:46:33] ripwarlock2: BENGAL TIGER IS NEW it was a white tiger before
[1:46:38] gnated: i dont think the gm took it
[1:46:39] kehayov: LOOK AT HIS ABILITY BLOOD LEACH ON WOWHEAD
[1:46:39] curedubs: turn in bloods all together while boss in on altar?
[1:46:40] cammieo59: xaryu walks to azeroth can run

[1:46:42] gnated: we pulled it there already
[1:46:43] burg3r_69: SSF? @xaryu
[1:46:46] hrod1life: What if boss doesn't drop anything that would be cringe
[1:46:46] Phrosted_: @Xaryu the boss is only killable if payo is not tired or needing to eat
[1:46:47] Yamamoto78: @PineappleDuh the tech is that the boss isnt meant to be killed so it wont die
[1:46:48] gnated: he just showed up
[1:46:48] cutexlol_: lagging the servers so everyone in SSF HC gets griefed KEKW
[1:46:50] ddevillax: U CAN DO IT XARYU IM BETTING ALL MY CHANNEL POINTS
[1:46:52] wubbawub32: Blood on the altar...sacrifice....there's meaning to it. You need to die on the altar to reduce his frenzy.
[1:46:53] hickey7979: bros no way a GM would intervene to give u guys a fucking hint
[1:46:53] MongoSecurity: The benefit to the arena is your casters could hit the boss from ledges and spread out more.  You need somewhere you aren't clumped up
[1:46:57] Kazunya_Meowryu: @burg3r_69 not till 4pm
[1:46:58] Morkaa: LOOK AT HIS ABILITIES ON WOWHEAD

[1:47:05] heypancaks: u play frost for having fun or why frost?
[1:47:10] Grillelise: Can someone tell me how long until showdown?
[1:47:10] t1isokatleague: bloodmoon weapons have anything to do with it? @Xaryu
[1:47:10] hickey7979: the gm will only intervene to do a live fix for something that wasnt working as intended use logic bros
[1:47:13] Kazunya_Meowryu: comes out in 5 hours @burg3r_69
[1:47:16] wahedje: why would the killing spot even matter if it has multiple spawn locations?
[1:47:20] ScryerTV: take him on boat to ratchet lol
[1:47:20] 13brill: when has kiting ever been an actual mechanic

[1:48:04] Gosho92: Maybe you need the help of the SOCAL Lady Killer
[1:48:04] HappyHansel: Maybe it's vulnerable to poopy diapers.
[1:48:04] Retz1t: The boss is meant to be un-killable so that the community stays active trying to figure it out @Xaryu

[1:49:07] bpwryl: bpwryl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! If you get him to 20% in 15 min, you have to deal 15 500 dps to kill him in time. That‚Äôs 78 dps from 200 ppl or 155 dps from 100 ppl. Sounds possible, unless there is yet another mechanic at 5% xD

[1:54:16] WaDaFruCK: could tank it with a shaman who has 10+ shaman using decoy totems on him
[1:54:16] Swapzz_: he one shots tho no?
[1:54:17] Nize2: get the guy with goggles tanking it and try
[1:54:18] WaDaFruCK: never get hit
[1:54:18] realandtruephobe: Gonna need a ton of priests
[1:54:19] jenova_cells: @Xaryu Need to be riding the gnomer mount plus wearing the goggles to expose debuff for loa boass
[1:54:19] WyldRotty: Ahh finally you need warriors
[1:54:19] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu Who is leading horde side?
[1:54:19] MongoSecurity: Payo... LUL
[1:54:20] Ryzehx: Discord way louder than you
[1:54:22] Pixiepantss: ill come !
[1:54:22] mylittlehombre: get some meta locks
[1:54:24] AgentPsycho: rogue tank b/c of parry
[1:54:24] SatanicAngelBlazed: way less dad
[1:54:31] SatanicAngelBlazed: but gigadads
[1:54:31] WyldRotty: We finally find out what Warriors are really for
[1:54:33] everganaj: it could be that with a max of 255
[1:54:34] brillowpadd: his ears
[1:54:36] regulater45: Just use 1 tank and no melees
[1:54:36] justinb_dmf: IF IT DOES DROP THE MOUNT, do you think everyone will get it? or one person?
[1:54:43] Triz08: could be both raids were at a ear cap
[1:54:44] Valencia_Pete: 255
[1:54:45] sal92mc06: Get it less than 250 ears
[1:54:45] AgentPsycho: Rogue tank with the sunglasses
[1:54:47] plae007: @Xaryu StaysafeTV got it to the same exact hp too, with only like 8-900 ears
[1:54:48] brillowpadd: more ears less dmg
[1:54:50] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: @Xaryu his health gain at 20% could have a cap at 255 ears, so under 255 might lower the health gained
[1:54:53] Acework: its always 255
[1:54:54] lizardboiy: 255 could be max
[1:54:55] curedubs: @justinb_dmf hopefully everyone or drop chance
[1:54:57] Acework: so its the same number
[1:55:00] blazzedzz: YESSSSS
[1:55:01] TodBobertson: @justinb_dmf No group tag, so it has to be personal loot or none.
[1:55:01] Pixiepantss: can he drop ears in anyway?
[1:55:01] everganaj: xaryu the tooltip stops the count at 255 maybe thats the max he can heal
[1:55:05] Khaidin: You might just have to kill him faster. like an enrage timer.
[1:55:05] realandtruephobe: No he had more, 255 is max to show, but if you mouse over it's wayyy more
[1:55:05] seenofish: maybe keep boss away from spirits so coordinate with dead?
[1:55:05] iPlayCuzFun: they aint listening
[1:55:06] Truckwood: @Xaryu but what if its a max number of health so they both hit
[1:55:06] RiverK1ngPoker: or at 20% you do more damage to it based on how many blood stacks you do. the brute force works as long as the raid has more towards max blood stacks
[1:55:06] zaguidar92: fact
[1:55:12] kharma99: 255 is just the max on the tool tip you can have wayyy more
[1:55:14] Geleff: The world boss satyr in duskwood, gets extremely powerful for each attacker being killed by him - It's not far fetched to think that the more he kills, the more OP he is
[1:55:16] Adem9x: u sound like a gnome now :D
[1:55:17] itkbutt3rs: Sub 255
[1:55:18] kharma99: First kill had 2500
[1:55:18] Nize2: its not 255, its more, 255 is just the max tooltip
[1:55:20] justinb_dmf: @TodBobertson mmm sounds correct
[1:55:21] sullyman13: 255 is buff stack cap
[1:55:21] Fuukaina: He had over 1000 ears by then
[1:55:21] panzmat: COPIUM
[1:55:22] acturs: @thrushmaster69 payo owns dude
[1:55:22] Napknutt: he had 1600 yesterday no???
[1:55:22] kharma99: first try
[1:55:22] zaguidar92: 255 IS THE MAX HE CAN GET
[1:55:22] squarepusher_: 255 is just the debuff cap, the tooltip shows actual; and the actual isn't limited.
[1:55:23] Fuukaina: I was there
[1:55:23] realandtruephobe: No, boss had like 1800 ears, it only shows 255
[1:55:24] myyrlidon: bro this is all copium
[1:55:24] Ervill1: yeah maybe but maybe not, as with everything
[1:55:24] seukas: theres no way thats the case
[1:55:24] Highparkk_: 1 person tries this now all the streamers are doing it lmao
[1:55:25] bhoffey: u right
[1:55:25] dr_g_ttv: you can tell these guys haven‚Äôt done the level research we have here
[1:55:26] hutchyy917: lmao
[1:55:26] xNotMat: LOL
[1:55:26] auroris9: Lol
[1:55:27] cookie_jayy: nahh
[1:55:27] mylittlehombre: whha
[1:55:27] lizardboiy: i understood bro
[1:55:28] Kenzu420: LOLOL
[1:55:30] Vichrinox: I understood
[1:55:30] Parametik: LOOOL
[1:55:30] juice42069: thats prob it
[1:55:32] Fujinator: @Xaryu perhaps that is used to avoid doing it with massive raids
[1:55:32] Valeeraw_: LMAo
[1:55:33] Nabblet: @Xaryu 255 is just the buff limit for wow (stack)
[1:55:35] clee0724: LUL
[1:55:35] bamfosaurus: make him deposit his stacks @Xaryu
[1:55:36] Dareka1111: the ears cap at 255, is what they're saying
[1:55:36] Bobndude: I like that idea Xar
[1:55:37] acturs: @thrushmaster69 payo owns u pvp and pve
[1:55:39] Shredmuffn: 255 is just the max 8 bit integer LUL
[1:55:41] Fuukaina: He had over 1000 ears Crusaider stike EU
[1:55:42] sullyman13: the description changes but the 255 from the stack is likely cap
[1:55:42] esportbully: that makes sense
[1:55:44] Valencia_Pete: he had max every time
[1:55:44] xNotMat: Simplest explanation of all time
[1:55:44] jaysstwotime: less than 255 = killable  more than 255 = enrage and not killable
[1:55:44] heypancaks: why u play frost mage now, for fun?
[1:55:51] iPlayCuzFun: sav slow xd
[1:55:51] back_again_paradar: he drops 10 silver
[1:55:53] PaperbackWritter: eeh, idk about this theory
[1:55:55] dumpdeer: 255 might be cap
[1:55:56] mylittlehombre: it‚Äôs way more than 255
[1:55:57] iPlayCuzFun: sav smoked a bowl for sure
[1:55:59] yaybump: @ xaryu IS STV LAYERED ANYMORE???
[1:56:02] Deatharmor98: Savix is brain farting hard asf right now and it hurts me
[1:56:04] miciahclay: you all trying this again at 12?
[1:56:05] ScryerTV: gotta tranq at 255
[1:56:06] GaryFTWlol: which layer
[1:56:06] Truckwood: @Xaryu maybe thgere is a maximum amount of health it can add and yall are all over the number of ears rquired
[1:56:07] Vichrinox: no way to kill him w/ less than 256 deaths
[1:56:16] 1osku: 255 is the blood cap aswell
[1:56:19] sullyman13: tranq shot
[1:56:21] Jehl703: Tranq shot
[1:56:21] hashal: Can you pull him to an alter of some kind where he "delievers" the ears, like the blood is delieved by the player?
[1:56:21] joestopfarmingshako: I have seen him frenzy when no one is dpsing him in regular events
[1:56:22] curedubs: goodjob shobek Clap
[1:56:23] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: tranq shot, get into MC
[1:56:26] KosmicDevil_: what if we try to just run away
[1:56:27] remotettl: shamans purge spell
[1:56:27] jacki_chans: payoOld
[1:56:28] alexonbreak: pepoG
[1:56:30] Hubbabubbamx: Maybe 255 is the max buff to health
[1:56:31] joshcheckers: tranq shot?
[1:56:34] English_Uk: Are we killing at noon????
[1:56:34] AgentPsycho: Rogue tank with the sunglasses
[1:56:35] teblol: That is what they said lmao
[1:56:36] Vichrinox: is tranq shot in the game yet?
[1:56:37] realandtruephobe: but it's not going to be possibnle to stop him from killing melee players
[1:56:37] Nize2: i wanna see if the guy with goggles can tank it
[1:56:38] PaperbackWritter: the 255 is just a 8bit int
[1:56:38] macjcool: how does he get a ear?
[1:56:38] YzieGG: 254 max
[1:56:38] quackums: how do i get an invite?
[1:56:39] juice42069: get him less than 255
[1:56:42] Bolt_: BRO
[1:56:42] ogkoop: maybe the blood god is non bianary
[1:56:43] flash0187: that would make him griefable
[1:56:44] 1osku: Try get 255 blood aswell!!! Its max blood stack
[1:56:48] jallaballan: Bring him to the spirits to remove enrage
[1:56:48] sullyman13: grab tranq shot from lucifron
[1:56:48] esportbully: you may need to wait till hunters get tranq shot
[1:56:48] WaDaFruCK: Shaman tank with spammed decoy totems from 10+ other shaman on him? each totem soaks 1 swing, could probably get full immune enough
[1:56:49] BroodingDoob: 255 is just a computer science thing, that's the visual cap for the buff icon
[1:56:50] McNerdSauce: ZUG ZUG
[1:56:50] Shatteredlol: @Xaryu Who is leading horde side?
[1:56:52] Bolt_: KILLED MY TTS
[1:56:53] TheHubbub: 255 bring to loa
[1:56:59] M0rley_: Would have killed him yesterday if you werent killing horde
[1:56:59] My_keI: @Shatteredlol Shobek
[1:57:00] elementzia: slight cope :(
[1:57:01] Timmyjk: That would make sense to prevent people from just bruteforcing him by the graveyard
[1:57:05] moist_perineum: there is no significance to 255 other than being an 8 bit int.
[1:57:05] aaronblack21: @Bolt_ wrong timing xD
[1:57:06] iPlayCuzFun: And my idea is that he will frenzy no matter what, for like 20seconds, and every kill he does during that time adds like 5sec to the frenzy
[1:57:06] enigmasvea: the event ALWAYSSS lags tho KEKW
[1:57:07] kickflipy: @Xaryu What if you have to /kneel or /bow to altar or the boss? emotes are used in Runes in SOD
[1:57:09] PaperbackWritter: he will kill easily over 200
[1:57:12] gregfork: He's immune to taunt
[1:57:13] lightninfury: People guna kill u all anyway to farm
[1:57:21] McNerdSauce: its gotta be super simple because its taking both factions.
[1:57:23] Vichrinox: @kickflipy i tried that yesterday while we were there
[1:57:23] Eggzactly54: @xaryu staysafe has a warlock tank
[1:57:24] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: oops shadow volley
[1:57:30] wowhellish: take time to repair gear h grom alli camp
[1:57:31] Nasty_Gnar: Bro what layer are you on??
[1:57:31] Fnafson: tthats bs
[1:57:33] Pixiepantss: hes immune to taunt ????
[1:57:34] Riceandbeans01: @Xaryu  255 ears is probably the max he can get buffed from
[1:57:35] EzPickenz1: rouge wound poison?
[1:57:35] Kasemox: No DCS COPIUM
[1:57:37] sweetmilktv: he will go taunt immune
[1:57:39] lylo_tv: @Nasty_Gnar asmon layer
[1:57:41] Kryuus: Taunt immune
[1:57:43] XLionGuardX: what time for ssf?
[1:57:44] plunger17: @Xaryu sacrafice everyone to the god? maybe he needs to reach x amount of ears then he will become killable
[1:57:45] bryn_dee: Guys c'mon aggrend already hinted that it's blood for the blood loa, you give him blood sacrifice, not kill him! Somehow he gives a reward once you've given him enough blood at the nearest altar to him.. or.. something? idk maybe it's copium but that just seems more like what the classic dev team would come up with :P
[1:57:45] floptimustv: That math is wrong
[1:57:49] yaybump: DOES STV STILL LAYER OR WILL WWWE ALL BE TOGETHER????
[1:57:50] macjcool: 78 dps in that lag is rough
[1:57:53] tbseason: lol this is comical
[1:57:56] floptimustv: You spend a TON of time dead
[1:57:56] Nize2: doesnt account for lag or dcs
[1:57:58] Riceandbeans01: @Xaryu  255 ears is probably the max he can get buffed from.
[1:57:59] spellingbxd: but in how long
[1:58:00] leeth58: can someone help me understand the story behind this world boss? what is the event and the boss? i'm new here ^^' Û†ÄÄ
[1:58:01] MajinTV: i play on AoL dial up i cant promise i wont dc
[1:58:02] SatanicAngelBlazed: that's like healer dps lol gg
[1:58:02] Elsevier86: You should have a dedicated group of 5 people to counter griefers. They just work out if any mages are aoeing and kill them
[1:58:04] Hubbabubbamx: 255 probably max stack
[1:58:06] Parametik: 33.2% chance of survival
[1:58:07] ScryerTV: ASK MELEE TO STAY OUT
[1:58:09] Parametik: repeating of course
[1:58:10] bubblesthebelfwarrior: 78x200 is only 15.6k a sec
[1:58:10] SpaceCowboy0811: No way Melee pulling that
[1:58:11] 1osku: @xaryu get 255 blood thats the max stack. Then 255 ears
[1:58:14] xtossboyx: some special items that can help? like bag of marbels or something like that
[1:58:15] boolgogiking: 255 most likely max stack
[1:58:15] qc3rs: also easier to heal your party members
[1:58:30] Shredmuffn: 255 is just the max 8 bit integer LUL  it goes higher
[1:58:30] realandtruephobe: you can kill a mob for one blood
[1:58:33] enigmasvea: @xaryu the event lags by default tho, it has lagged since release
[1:58:34] Bolt_: 78 DPS * 900 seconds * 200 people = 14,040,000
[1:58:34] zangari_: is this hardcore
[1:58:36] Vichrinox: the problem is, if you start killin ppl, ppl wont stop
[1:58:38] berrychronic: this is the EVENT of phase 2 evereyone is going to be there
[1:58:39] plunger17: @Xaryu sacrafice everyone to the god? maybe he needs to reach x amount of ears then he will become killable
[1:58:40] TyyrealGaming: are you doing layer invites again?
[1:58:40] packtar: better start getting peeps layered
[1:58:56] Ezionn: You need to summon Asmongold, only he can kill him.
[1:58:59] jujujay_myalias: @Xaryu He can target people while they're dead in ghost form FYI (Happened to me when there was no one alive around him)
[1:58:59] SpaceCowboy0811: Yesterday people were actually pretty chill
[1:59:01] ultorrmars: ultorrmars subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Top tier content , keep it up xar !

[1:59:21] chancerofl: @TodBobertson chill, u dont lose blood if he kills you
[1:59:22] PaperbackWritter: need to keep a group close to each spawn point
[1:59:33] plunger17: @Xaryu sacrafice everyone to the god? maybe he needs to reach x amount of ears then he will become killable
[1:59:33] sal92mc06: Gnomer geared pumpers only
[1:59:34] Loodimus: I dont think youll be able to stop the ammount of people the hype is too real
[1:59:34] scoutbeans: but you're going to have tons of people... you have the whole server wanting to be involved now
[1:59:35] Bolt_: @Xaryu Is this enough? 78 DPS * 900 seconds * 200 people = 14,040,000
[1:59:35] 209tomcat: nah you want 1000

[2:12:56] Diddly_dope: feel like he is 2 chunking
[2:12:56] ChristoxCrousT: Horde whisper me - Panguses - "inv" for layer 3 invite

[2:14:17] CyonDru: might just be that he cant die and its to promote pvp @Xaryu

[2:14:18] 13brill: Kiting has never been a mechanic
[2:14:19] ChristoxCrousT: Horde whisper me - Panguses - "inv" for layer 3 invite
[2:14:20] mrbeggin89: what if he can be killed at the arena only
[2:14:21] Soulmangos: @EmJayKae summoning people for 5 man groups
[2:14:24] YyTonyMa: or he's just unkillable and there's no reason to kill him, i hope im wrong
[2:14:30] ricktickticcow: Alter makes him turn in his ears
[2:14:31] auroris9: They just copy pasted some other enrage onto him to make him unkillable lol

[2:15:05] hvzewrldxo: 1
[2:15:05] DrazaTraza: how often do you miss on him a 60 would be hard af to hit
[2:15:06] sullyman13: that's why you need tranq shot from MC to remove his enrage
[2:15:12] hubbabubbakokbatot: hmmMeeting
[2:15:17] Soccer_Bob: who ca i whisper for invite to layer alliance?

[2:19:01] xAlastor89: What if they kill it and boss has no loot?
[2:19:01] Aramec: can everyone use target dummy ?
[2:19:01] sengip: @karl__hungus  shut up
[2:19:03] Dabakss: maybe wearing set and not having blood makes him take damage instead of heal? similar to atal'dazar boss
[2:19:04] mylittlehombre: maybe anyone with the irritated does more damage to him
[2:19:04] poonti51: what about taking him to an altar so he drops his ear stacks before 20%?
[2:19:05] Falkhord: why would they create a pvp event just to pve 1 mob and kill a boss?
[2:19:06] NotASkiller: If all these players queued solo shuffle it would fix the long queues......
[2:19:10] A_Rodimus: why does he say irridated 95% of the time but rarely says correctly irradiated?

[2:19:42] mfushi: what is going on ?
[2:19:43] adam90k: drain him at altar to stay below 255
[2:19:44] shoops: I think the set that glows is just a cool cosmetic thing for being a glass canon. (reminds me of D2 teir sets glowing)
[2:19:44] lemonarque: Streamers Try To Pronounce Irradiated Challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
[2:19:48] TrebekTv: stop listening to shobek lmao
[2:19:49] karl__hungus: @sengip it‚Äôs more of a complaint against blizzard not having meaningful solutions for the lag than anything
[2:19:50] Dogarian: @xaryu HE HAS TO EAT A BODY THAT HAS THE SET

[2:20:02] Nightmareo: People getting layered off
[2:20:10] realandtruephobe: Idk if everyone did it, but a lot of us did.
[2:20:13] KetsuN: What if at 20% he heals per each stack of ears he has.  14.5M - 3.2M = 11.3M which is around 45K health per ear if he has 255 ears
[2:20:19] JubbeJude: world shrinker item from gnomer?
[2:20:21] bushthebug: hearthstone just lagged out
[2:20:21] dutchsean: Drop blood @ 20%

[2:20:38] xNotorietyx: too many people already @Xaryu
[2:20:38] Swapzz_: @KetsuN he has way more than 255 its just a ui bug

[2:20:40] Moronomics: EU players are worth like 5 na though

[3:18:54] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[3:18:54] Pyroheet: what if you have more blood you do more dmg? Xaryu
[3:18:58] MavenGames: you have to kite him in the water, to wash off the blood

[3:19:25] ryandrewu: don't turn in, so you're ready for the next event
[3:19:25] tigerslap_ow: I thought him killing you without blood, healed him
[3:19:30] cookie_jayy: The would make sense, cause blood for the blood god
[3:19:35] killawatts75: Ive been crafting this up the past few pulls and Ive found if you dont die as much we will do more dmg and the boss will potentially die.
[3:19:36] TBAGodzilla: Pepega feels like my work meeting when everyone pitch a stupid ideas
[3:19:36] Tearswae: Blood for the blood loa

[3:19:40] Zandarkun: how close did y‚Äôall get?

[3:19:50] Almighty_kenzo: Anybody tryna help me kill Chok'sul ?
[3:19:50] bhoffey: 2-3 raid groups in 1 layer
[3:19:51] encrypteddeath: Would AoE dmg be better than? that sounds like that is not helpful.
[3:19:52] r4men_noodle: Just got back, did I miss the world first kill??
[3:19:52] MrMowf: @Xaryu ZG spawn is best because you can kite him into ZG mobs, i have seen 4 of them wailing on him before.  they eventually steal aggro, but the DPS is INSANE
[3:19:53] Skygan: PAY OMEGALUL
[3:19:54] Androllic: I think more dmg is done with more bloods @xaryu
[3:19:54] hickey7979: if u had payo instead of warr in group woulda been ez kill
[3:19:55] apexariestv: dhd do a league move kill off people that get to low so he doesn‚Äôt get ear
[3:19:56] josefstal55: Payo payoShavedofc
[3:19:59] binxbinxbinxbinx: Asmon can chop down trees with those teeth
[3:20:00] kindaopmusic: what did the boss get down too?
[3:20:03] kenzellbtw: @Xaryu the horde keeps killing people
[3:20:03] auroris9: You need some kinda toxic blood debuff, like cursed blood, or its not meant to be done
[3:20:03] Dareka1111: no damage, just die with blood
[3:20:04] AbyssReborn: Have you guys tried just killing it Kappa
[3:20:04] Wrenzoe: not enough ttime for everyone to get max bloods
[3:20:06] Wrenzoe: there is no way
[3:20:06] SteffeHaGG: Less people = less lag. Less lag = more DPS. More DPS = Boss dead
[3:20:06] MyKeoger: BRING AS MANY BLOODS AS POSSIBLE TO BOSS
[3:20:06] TokerTy420: max blood will take to long
[3:20:08] bagelking123: so no kill?
[3:20:09] angryjessx: just bring a dh

[3:20:15] ThePharmG: scuffed start
[3:20:16] thandelmtj: Pay up ü§£
[3:20:17] ReuvenGT: Someone send Payo the cords please
[3:20:17] Ezionn: Guys Asmongold would have solo the boss 1v1.
[3:20:17] the_doody: Xar the GM from yesterday did have the buff to not get affected by the blood moon- can you attack him with the debuff?
[3:20:20] r4men_noodle: How close was it??
[3:20:21] scottish_barsteward: The GM did say yesterday about accepting your sacrifice @xaryu
[3:20:21] Bjsmitty: wouldn‚Äôt it make sense that it‚Äôd work the opposite way
[3:20:23] UltrawideGameGuy: Think about what the Blizz person said. "You may want to avoid him". The key is to get tehre and pvp players en masse. It will appease him.
[3:20:23] kellenoyster: dang so close
[3:20:24] Joxtirol: in event when no one focuse him he always at 100% so blood dont do dmg
[3:20:28] skoobss: we spent the first 10 minutes healing him at the altar
[3:20:28] Tovone: I think this is COPIUM YEP
[3:20:28] succaw: we dced like 4 times KEKW
[3:20:29] PaperbackWritter: people spread way too far too
[3:20:29] MrMowf: @xaryu ZG mob dps     you can try getting him to fight them.   they SMASH
[3:20:30] palo48: would require blizz's servers to work
[3:20:30] Tophi: you guys im so close to mount and you fucking me up
[3:20:31] mylittlehombre: the beginning was rough
[3:20:31] ogkoop: If you were vaccinated he does there
[3:20:31] TobyNova: The first 10 mins people were walking on altars etc healing him
[3:20:32] ctrlbeesy: ONE RAID TO SACRIFICE BLOODS INE RAID TO KILL BOSS
[3:20:34] macjcool: LMAO
[3:20:34] Draznath: so much COPIUM
[3:20:34] PANIC_Ionator: needing this number of people wont be in the game design.
[3:20:34] Wrenzoe: you think you will spend less than 11 mins getting max blood for 200 people??
[3:20:35] puntbabies: next server crash at 3, thanks
[3:20:36] poochypaunch: lol HOW ARE YOU GONNA SEPERATE LAYERS
[3:20:36] jbeemerks: faster start. less people for him to get ears from
[3:20:36] MrMowf: @xaryu ZG mob dps     you can try getting him to fight them.   they SMASH!!
[3:20:37] kboyyyyy: 11 minutes YOULL NEVBER GET BACK

[3:20:44] Xtribius: did you figure out what is the bruised debuff ?
[3:20:44] puntbabies: this isnt a thing
[3:20:47] hickey7979: its bc u ghosted payo
[3:20:47] drakeeatscakes: @Xaryu what are the cords?
[3:20:47] Zanketsuk3n: message the devs to overcharge the servers, so we can actually kill the blood boss
[3:20:50] hickey7979: u had payo ez kill
[3:20:52] xlineagefreek: my layer didnt have as many as yours and we still lagged when the boss got to 15%
[3:20:52] Catfishman2: Catfishman2 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:20:54] dragonswordrs: it doesnt matter what layer youre on, its crashing the game regardless
[3:20:54] ZometTheComet: No I will bring my horde there! Zug Zug
[3:20:55] Eggzactly54: is there a pattern in where he spawns? to know where he could or should be next spawn?
[3:20:55] disar27: less people will be worse man
[3:20:55] ReuvenGT: Send Payo the cords
[3:20:55] Tels: @xaryu I think you guys are doing an event that‚Äôs designed for a higher level, dunno if it‚Äôs designed to be defeated this way
[3:20:56] miciahclay: if both horde and alliance are there won't it be the same stress to the servers regardless of layer?
[3:20:57] bryn_dee: @Reaperz_kinetic I wouldn't put it past the devs to troll the heck out of us and just let people keep trying tho lol. Idk would be cool to see if he does drop something but the "blood for the blood loa" hint just doesnt point to "murder the loa" but could be wrong, i guess we wil see eventually
[3:20:57] Zeal_primeTV: try in europe there wont be GMs
[3:20:59] PaperbackWritter: you lost 3 min walking
[3:21:01] Rumseyrum04: everyone needs blood though this time
[3:21:02] shalomski: Try get higher layer like 5
[3:21:04] ZometTheComet: Us horde deserve credit
[3:21:04] ctrlbeesy: payo wouldve killed it payoSad
[3:21:04] shadwarform: make a 40 man raid of hunters then spread them in 5. they have pets and dont glance attacks
[3:21:05] CitizenDesmond: @Zanketsuk3n If only thats how servers worked
[3:21:05] Zanketsuk3n: we just need stable strat
[3:21:06] poochypaunch: yes its dumb
[3:21:06] SchiffersGaming: did they get it
[3:21:06] bhoffey: no
[3:21:07] mfingchad: They gunna be crashing the servers again today?

[3:21:09] macjcool: you will not stop people from joininng
[3:21:10] Joxtirol: pop cd at 20
[3:21:11] MrMowf: ZG spawn = zgg mobs will  fight him and do so much dmg.
[3:21:12] Judeese: @Xaryu all layers are lagged at the same time, so dont split
[3:21:13] regulater45: It makes sense
[3:21:13] biggrizz315: lag only thing messing u up
[3:21:13] marioag714: no
[3:21:14] vash61: it‚Äôs dumb and would never work
[3:21:14] sal92mc06: Disagree
[3:21:14] dizze1988: yes
[3:21:16] peanutbutta240: the best strat is bliz fix servers
[3:21:16] zxzzzxz2000: did you guys kill it ?
[3:21:16] Bodhisage: there will be more ppl as hype spreads
[3:21:18] disciple007: if you play hardcore don't log in at 3!
[3:21:18] VFLGavo: bro y‚Äôall just have to pull away from alter, prevent healing‚Ä¶ first 10 minutes was that
[3:21:18] PaperbackWritter: you need more people yeah
[3:21:19] CIamzy: You can't stop people from coming
[3:21:19] Androllic: yo @Xaryu what if bloods increase damage delt to boss and you have to kite em to remove his ears which heals him on kills
[3:21:20] mackearns: DO IT TOGETHER
[3:21:20] zackslacks: 95% of a layer pop MIGHT work
[3:21:20] zin_panda: Less people won't matter
[3:21:21] solidturlte1: can you fight boss with the blood moon protection buff??
[3:21:21] disar27: you will still lag, and have less people with less dps
[3:21:21] outlastyou69: 16k watching today!!!
[3:21:22] ZometTheComet: You can't stop people from joining

[3:21:23] auuzib: Someone wake up asmon, he will get the people together needed + a GM
[3:21:24] apexariestv: idea!!! do a league move kill off people that get to low so he doesn‚Äôt get ear
[3:21:26] Xottz: I get dced on other layers
[3:21:27] dragonswordrs: yeah im dcing in loch modan off your layer
[3:21:27] sal92mc06: Disagree you dont want more people
[3:21:27] Yamamoto78: @Tels or its not an event at all and the mob is not designed to die, which is why his hp jumps if he ever gets low
[3:21:27] PaperbackWritter: the start was fine
[3:21:29] Jomo908: whats the addon for seeing the mobs health number?
[3:21:29] Strakattackx: its the whole company that lags lol
[3:21:29] Viisionz74: yes I think it‚Äôs stupid lose a shit ton of damage
[3:21:29] Brentsflix: only their layer crashed, not others
[3:21:30] mrlemons: Just kill the boss 4HEad
[3:21:31] marioag714: makes sense because the problem is the lag
[3:21:32] conq_89: Yes it‚Äôs gonna lag either way
[3:21:32] Splitix: Aggrend replied to a Savix tweet and said, "Blood for the Blood Loa" so maybe having more blood isn't a bad idea
[3:21:32] Zoismoe: all together
[3:21:32] o_lark: Im on a different server and getting disconnected
[3:21:32] Draznath: so many Pepega 's talking on stream right now lol
[3:21:33] grkgemini94: i think even on different layers the sheer population of players online at the same time will still cause the same issues
[3:21:33] sushileafbeats: 16k viewers was crazy
[3:21:33] tztdarth: LISTEN DONT KEEP HIM NEAR ALTAR AND JUST BURST HIM IN THE OPEN
[3:21:34] Poondagoon: it‚Äôs every server
[3:21:34] HavarV: HavarV subscribed with Prime. 
[3:21:35] Zoismoe: and batch
[3:21:36] Smungathon: nah that many ppl is unplayable
[3:21:36] jfreed7852: pretty sure they won‚Äôt allow it to be killed
[3:21:36] Dancheek: FYI i was on another layer and not lagging or dc'ing at all
[3:21:37] naturalduck: Split horde and ally for sure. My layer had 0 lag
[3:21:37] nickels396: no it‚Äôs not stupid. I was doing 11 when I normally would be doing 300+ @xaryu
[3:21:38] brewtank: @xaryu why would blizz intend for you to kill it with 1k players imo
[3:21:38] enigmasvea: the event has ALWAYSSS lagged since release LUL
[3:21:38] ZometTheComet: We are all a team
[3:21:39] yaybump: if HC crashed off what we're doing. layering wont change a thing.
[3:21:39] jskillit: its lagging all wow servers lol
[3:21:42] shalomski: Get on a higher layer, 1/2/3 most busy
[3:21:43] Nize2: i agree w the batching thing
[3:21:44] Reaperz_kinetic: @bryn_dee im not even talking about the blood for the blood loa there was an interview where someone asked if the boss dropped cool raid level gear and they said you have to go get him and find out
[3:21:44] ourforcesready: my STV layer never crashed during the whole event
[3:21:44] packtar: I think you should just repeat this you had it with a little better start
[3:21:44] sal92mc06: You dont want more people, more people = more lag = more chaos = more griefers
[3:21:45] iFennessey: kill closer to repair, mele completely broken 15 mins in
[3:21:45] TyyrealGaming: It makes sense on paper, or like in my head. But its the server lagging, not layer.
[3:21:46] poochypaunch: there will just be LESS people later in teh day
[3:21:47] the_doody: bring engineering pets. they won‚Äôt despawn when you DC
[3:21:47] xlineagefreek: you all have created a monster
[3:21:49] bhoffey: you didn't kill it BECAUSE everyone's dcing and why is that? trying to join the SAME layer
[3:21:49] Xtribius: @Xaryu  did you figure out what is the bruised debuff ?
[3:21:52] baldanduseless: just need a better boss location and better luck @Xaryu
[3:21:54] haansi1337: What does the boss give you?
[3:21:55] disciple007: lol
[3:21:56] bhoffey: less people = win
[3:21:56] Xottz: all mages should be pyro blasting with the lag. long cast time and a dot
[3:21:57] conq_89: Yeah let‚Äôs cut damage in half?
[3:21:58] mrlemons: Do the 2AM one lol
[3:21:58] qc3rs: might have less lag if it's spread out though
[3:21:58] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: Do it in the am
[3:21:59] Dr0ddy: Do it at midnight when no one is on
[3:22:06] Bodhisage: layer 6 at zg got 17%
[3:22:08] apexariestv: I have a idea do a league move kill off people that get to low so he doesn‚Äôt get ear
[3:22:09] Django_7: what was the best pull?
[3:22:12] neehize: @Xaryu I think you're right, Blizzard would never designed a boss that needs to be killed by 200+ players because the developers would have said not possible.
[3:22:13] chobinhood_: that message just comes randomly when server is fucked
[3:22:17] Saturos47: no thats what it says when you get event tagged
[3:22:18] Merik92: blizzard needs to confirm if killing him does anything or not
[3:22:18] smilekyth: it lags like that at 3AM
[3:22:19] sync3: do it at midnight no lag at all
[3:22:19] KosmicDevil_: it shows that all the time
[3:22:20] madamedog: I saw it too
[3:22:20] darkmagi2: @Xaryu  for what it's worth, I was on a different layer than you and lagged out when he was at 17%. Then when it was clearly not gonna happen I left group and relogged and got to a  different layer where he was 66% and it was lagging there too. lag didn't stop still the event ended.
[3:22:21] MightyCactus1: @Xaryu you turned the pvp event into a PVE event
[3:22:24] Reaperz_kinetic: im down LMFAO
[3:22:29] LowkeyPrime: What are the biggest bags in SoD?
[3:22:29] xwalonosx: bruised debuff is getting killed by the blood god I‚Äôm pretty sure
[3:22:30] oxmank: pls next rule "kill all mages u see"
[3:22:35] marioag714: if you have a good spawn and people die and revive fast as f I thinks the boss
[3:22:40] apexariestv: do a league move kill off people that get to low so he doesn‚Äôt get ear
[3:22:41] the_doody: bring pets! pets stay up when you DC - get some dragonkins and Hunter pets
[3:22:43] Captain_Ender: crusader strike has like 100000s of ppl on 24/7 - even 6am lmao
[3:22:45] Slyratt: there isn‚Äôt a layer without lag lol
[3:22:45] o_lark: you are the lag

[3:22:48] LordBambii: The mages are braindead too and kept living flame
[3:22:48] dryforg1v1ng: there is no layer without lag, multiple servers are lagging from this
[3:22:49] suicidle: i was lagging in thousand needles bro
[3:22:50] bojji900: How can blizzard allow these kinda servers and  make a event like this? clowns for real ü§°
[3:22:50] FuffaIo: you arent gonna get no lag even the regular events are laggy as fuck
[3:22:50] baldanduseless: yeah but people will oom
[3:22:50] bhoffey: u are right
[3:22:51] Ardal_Obe: every layer has lag
[3:22:51] zSoSupreme: xarbad
[3:22:52] blekkTV: @LowkeyPrime 16 slot from waylaid vendor
[3:22:53] 13brill: BE ONE WITH THE LAG
[3:22:53] Yungwiz: @Xaryu BUT ALL THE LAYERS DC
[3:22:53] Dareka1111: maybe the damage is not spells.. but the blood
[3:22:54] lucasthebestx: xaryu stop hyping this shit
[3:22:55] Bodhisage: not accounting for ppl dieing
[3:22:56] gloneiric: less people just means less targets and you'd wipe way more
[3:22:56] Tovone: wont matter whole server is lagging @Xaryu
[3:22:57] Skullkandy2933: What % they get the boss down to?
[3:22:57] gloydthewarrior: xaryu it has 14 mill HP u need people
[3:22:58] vampirebees: xaryus just trying to parse LMFAO
[3:22:58] Slyratt: you ARE the lag
[3:22:59] ExpectKhaos: still just died to living flame. mages did not listen
[3:22:59] Androllic: I think you do more damage with more bloods
[3:23:00] frederikv225: less people wont make the parse pump i guess
[3:23:00] bojji900: How can blizzard allow these kinda servers and  make a event like this? clowns for real ü§°  .
[3:23:00] gloydthewarrior: ur 300 dps doesnt matter
[3:23:00] Xottz: @xaryu pyroblast is the move. long cast time and a dot
[3:23:01] auroris9: But the lag saved dmg on the transition

[3:25:35] Purplexxityy: cheesing it would be better content than that
[3:25:35] uncleetito: when you guys did this yesterday me and everyone in TB couldn't play at all

[3:25:45] ipntheshower: I think a super early one is a good idea all the normie dads will be heading to work
[3:25:48] LexaproNLattes: @nuhc Personally, I think its a fun mode to play casually. Degening will leave you with no content very quickly. Find a fun small guild to prog and play at their own pace
[3:25:48] Ryzehx: 12k viewers, nice
[3:25:50] bhoffey: ez clap
[3:25:52] LordBambii: everyone is prob just gonna try to kill the boss now
[3:25:52] Knocktoff: no
[3:25:54] Tophi: devs would tell us the boss has no loot table if it wasnt killable right?
[3:25:54] poochypaunch: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT?
[3:25:55] enigmasvea: no shot
[3:25:55] chr47: no shot
[3:25:55] AbyssReborn: 99 parser boomy here

[3:25:57] sullyman13: they're gonna die
[3:25:58] prfssrzaddy: No streamer coordination, EZ kill
[3:26:01] Bigslappyx: you cant do 500 dps vs a mob that high level
[3:26:01] spellingbxd: 500 dps will never happen on this boss
[3:26:01] itsterryhesticals: 500 Dps = Death
[3:26:07] muztho: healeres guna oom
[3:26:08] packtar: but that is better for the east coast servers, west coast servers 6 is 9
[3:26:08] soulnobi: ask a GM to tank
[3:26:10] gaming5150: fUCKING HEALERS KEKW
[3:26:14] Reaperz_kinetic: @spellingbxd i literally had 500 dps as arcane
[3:26:15] Judeese: The boss will kill 5 of you in one swipe, so you gonna be running most of the time
[3:26:16] gloneiric: you cannot tank it
[3:26:17] Sastan: Put a bounch of arcane mages with regen on tank
[3:26:17] rohmantv: the problem is mconnel says to much bullshit
[3:26:19] chr47: people aren't doing 500 dps they constantly die and don't have raid buffs
[3:26:20] Austyz: why would blizzard not intervene at this point and just tell people whether this is the way or not if it‚Äôs crashing the servers
[3:26:21] SnackshotGod: really trying to force the content outta sod i respect it
[3:26:22] realmalfurionsr: 4 Healers and 1 Tank @Xaryu I could hold the boss for a few hits with tank gear]
[3:26:23] Reaperz_kinetic: @Bigslappyx i had 500 dps as arcane dude
[3:26:23] LordBambii: @STREAMSNIPELUL you cant even damage him because we got mages aoe'ing and lagging
[3:26:23] ZometTheComet: Healers in SOD are so fucking baad man Sadge
[3:26:23] Cross86: bruh sardaco, i can heal the f outta u all lol if i can move
[3:26:25] Xottz: healer heal go oom die rez repeat

[3:26:33] Efaxz: Efaxz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[3:26:34] Arckke: The strat is so simple. You make a GM ticket and ask for one of them to tank for you duh
[3:26:34] Kaekias: make groups with 1 tank and 4 healers to keep that tank up
[3:26:35] uncleetito: 3pm is so bad thats when most normal people can actually play the game
[3:26:36] linsenchips: Put SHadowpriest in Grp with tank
[3:26:36] jxperience: @Xaryu 4 healers with tank x 2
[3:26:37] solodegen: just make healing groups and dps groups and have the healers target heal
[3:26:38] ggSKEET: theres 0 % chance xar or other streamers would get banned for literally just trying to kill a raid boss that devs put there that seems like it can be killed
[3:26:45] foxwinkle: I think if people just make 5 man grps its doable
[3:26:46] Pormixius: Farm bloods first, then join raid.
[3:26:47] poochypaunch: this dude just dumb? wtf
[3:26:48] TortugaAtomico: Just stack a tank group wtih 4 healers 1 tank per group

[3:26:52] Redhed_Iou: try 5 manning it GIGACHAD
[3:26:54] jmaccadillac: 4 heals 1 tank for sure
[3:26:54] baldanduseless: youre not going to have 30 people do 20 mil dps
[3:26:54] butlerlog: each tank could be in a 5 man with 4 healers with hots on them
[3:26:54] mineirocomfrio: put 4 shadow priest in the tank group and of party healers healing the tank
[3:26:57] CoolTV: 3AM is too early
[3:26:58] Yungwiz: @Xaryu 1 Group with 2 ttanks and 3 healers
[3:26:58] InsertYourseIf: OMEGALUL
[3:26:58] srrymyfingerslip: 3 tank groups 1 tank 4 healers each then DPS makes raid
[3:26:59] FinaticYum: are people to just log off ?
[3:26:59] PineappleDuh: there is no way this is the intended strat
[3:27:00] prfssrzaddy: Healers and tanks in raid group, everyone else 5 man
[3:27:01] jaykelul: 35 healers + 5 tank raid group
[3:27:02] ShooterMcGavin827: @xaryu i think a logical argument is blizzard doesnt intend for only massive groups doing
[3:27:02] foxwinkle: @Xaryu why not create a lot of 5 man grps?
[3:27:03] Tophi: do a 3am attempt it is only chance
[3:27:04] DankestDingus: im down
[3:27:04] nistaux: I feel like the event was laggy af before streamers started trying to kill boss. It is just gunna be laggy no matter what
[3:27:05] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: 3am Chad here
[3:27:06] cookie_jayy: you say it tho people will log on
[3:27:07] ShooterMcGavin827: theres a weird mechanic yall missing
[3:27:08] jujujay_myalias: Make 5 man dedicated tank groups with 1 tank and 4 healers
[3:27:08] the_doody: just did the math. if 100 people did 180 dps then you could get from 13,000,000 to 0 in 12 minutes
[3:27:08] mooarigato: Has anyone ever said that you look like Ryan Garcia?
[3:27:08] gangletronic: have healers max range and opt out??? @Xaryu

[3:27:19] Unfragged: STOP CRASHING THE SERVERS FFS
[3:27:20] dadbanger1: reverse psychology them and go at 3pm 5Head
[3:27:21] CoolTV: 3 AM IS POPULATED, GOTTA DO 6 AM
[3:27:22] Hiebly: If he heals based on how many people he killed, wouldnt it be better to start the fight with less people and add in all the extra people after he transitions?
[3:27:24] xlineagefreek: regular dad andys will beat the streamer army
[3:27:24] puntbabies: how do you know
[3:27:25] shadowvypers: whoever is there is there without pulling people to the layer
[3:27:27] tmacd: no devs wont let you
[3:27:27] HunterericTV: other streamers trying to steal the glory LUL
[3:27:27] Androllic: I think you need to look at Dps during the fight and see who is doing the most and look at the dmg comparison with bloods
[3:27:31] Kylemist: EU are getting it in 15 mins, dont worry Xar
[3:27:31] LimpsNoodles: send the clip to blkizz so they patch it lmao

[3:27:35] anthocouz: next one COPIUM
[3:27:35] ShooterMcGavin827: @xaryu i think a logical argument is blizzard doesnt intend for only massive groups doing for streamers. what about smaller servers theres a mechanic to it i believe
[3:27:37] MightyCactus1: @Xaryu If trying to kill the boss downs servers, most likely it may be killable, but it might not be meant to be killed
[3:27:37] Nebulas2: just do 2 diff layers
[3:27:37] Fnafson: more entertaining than RWF
[3:27:38] Karev: @Xaryu you gotta pvp for it. setup pvp grps and setup pve grps like you said. kill the others and dont let theem enter the area.
[3:27:38] arrkies91: @Unfragged look at this loser
[3:27:40] cuze1337: next event on EU in 20 minutes
[3:27:40] Cythra: whos doing it on eu
[3:27:41] AC1DNUK3: you know iots getting cheesed today with that spot
[3:27:41] EbbnflowDNT: @Xaryu do a horde layer and an alliance layer. good content and puts the factions against eachother
[3:27:43] kindaopmusic: They might need to nerf it a bit more
[3:27:45] josephpeat: @Xaryu unboon WB at 20%
[3:27:45] TortugaAtomico: @rohmantv a lot of people waiting for next week's patch
[3:27:45] Shredmuffn: 8-9 raid groups is way too much yall just lagging no dps
[3:27:53] nmitchell219: They should evade if the streamer is not doing it, but if a non streamer is doing it evade them so we can get teh clips
[3:27:53] ogkoop: Are you vaccinated
[3:27:54] st4ckz8: what happen to the loa? y‚Äôall kill him?
[3:27:54] jujujay_myalias: Make 5 man dedicated tank groups with 1 tank and 4 healers
[3:28:00] austinlovescookiez: Ahmpys idea was good, at 20% just pop all cds and try to get to 15% before health increases
[3:28:00] naturalduck: Blizzard: you have 2 hours to fix this bug and push it to production KEKW
[3:28:01] shadowvypers: create your 5 man and just go with whoever gets on the layer naturally
[3:28:03] prfssrzaddy: I have done the 3am one almost every night this week, there is tons of people
[3:28:04] bhoffey: yessir
[3:28:05] LordBambii: you cant dps though
[3:28:07] pairofsnax: Even if they fix it people will find a spot like you can for Rise, Obsidion! quest
[3:28:10] bottis96: What about Phase3 at 5%
[3:28:11] realandtruephobe: Try a smaller group at 3pm, I will sit out.

[3:28:13] DistxTV: event in15 on wire EZ world first
[3:28:16] racer962: He's not counting the constant heals
[3:28:22] dr_g_ttv: That math is assuming he does 0 healing
[3:28:22] DanRas08: What If we get healers not participating in the event just healing their factions
[3:28:23] DistxTV: eu *
[3:28:25] purplejezusjuice: it heals a shit ton
[3:28:28] Diddly_dope: WHAT COORDINATES?
[3:28:29] purplejezusjuice: not equating for that

[3:28:30] ggSKEET: EU gonna get the first
[3:28:32] VFLGavo: yeah but that doesn‚Äôt consider dying
[3:28:34] greenmanalpha: you need some groups to guard the areana and kill people trying to get in
[3:28:37] iFennessey: mele is all broken, kill on Hemingway for repairs
[3:28:37] kindaopmusic: even layer 8?
[3:28:38] Almighty_kenzo: Yall hate PAYO lol

[3:28:47] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: if you guys just repeat the same thing, you'll be fine. Ya'll lost so much time at the begining when people were up and it was healing
[3:28:48] Tophi: better not be BIS items dropping from this boss. thatd be lame af

[3:29:03] Nize2: every layer is definitely gonna be full
[3:29:03] Reaperz_kinetic: @STREAMSNIPELUL this is so wrong
[3:29:05] gloneiric: i averaged 150 dps as a spriest and i died like constantly with grifers, dots are the best to kill him cuz they keep ticking after death
[3:29:06] frederikv225: True Û†ÄÄ
[3:29:06] sullyman13: CHECK LOGS

[3:30:16] 5thD5thD: wildgrowth
[3:30:16] BeeMcG: max out dps
[3:30:17] Xottz: fire mage is best for this. crit dots. long cast pyros. scorch for extra damage
[3:30:18] pairofsnax: Even with that group It was doable if it wasnt getting healed so much in the beginning
[3:30:19] shalomski: Druid wild growths will help
[3:30:20] madamedog: @Xaryu its impossible to heal, can take up to 10 sec to send a mending

[3:30:36] RoosterBooster_: @Xaryu you need to try to have 3 dedicaded "tank groups" with like 2 tanks each and 3 healers and try to tank him somewhat, every swing he doesnt get a kill is a bonus to you
[3:30:38] NOHEARTs4: Wild growth boomys unite

[3:30:44] ZometTheComet: @peanutbutta240 Lets be real bro is too busy third life in GTA LUL
[3:30:46] Heart042: 100% you have to DPS boss down to 20% for the health bump and then you have to start sacrificing your bloods/self to heal him back to full and force him to 'overheal' and explode!
[3:30:47] BlackRe3per: @Xaryu there was still tons of hunter traps and mage AOEs
[3:30:47] InsertYourseIf: you were dying with 0 bloods at the start @Xaryu
[3:30:48] fenocian: i think its much more easier than that
[3:30:49] loafers6969: Thank you Xaryu our group got lots of coins thanks to your raid.
[3:30:52] rathura: maybe the more blood he has the less he heals
[3:30:53] trxxx: Wheres coords? KEKW poor payo
[3:30:53] Hiebly: @Xaryu Boss heals based on trophy count, so maybe better to start fight with less players, then add in extra players AFTER enrage
[3:30:59] Mobely__: AKSHUALLY 255
[3:31:00] yyyy420: target dummies ?
[3:31:02] oxmank: all die naked give ur blood to him
[3:31:02] TrapAlt: Do we know what the bruised does?
[3:31:03] SoSoBurrito: spend the first 15 min farming bloods then 1 shot em EZ Clap
[3:31:04] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: you just need to kill the people without bloods at the begining so he stops healing
[3:31:05] muztho: there was poeple with no bloods or he wouldnt of been healing
[3:31:05] googlewooglex: You can coordinate so that groups with tanks & healers are in the same groups so tanks keep taunting & stay alive = less ears for boss etc
[3:31:06] ijixed: you had a really rocky start though
[3:31:08] BlackMagick15: Go get 200 bloods, then only fight boss when you are 200+
[3:31:08] bhoffey: @Hiebly this
[3:31:09] subbyye: Shout out to savix for actually caring about the server and no a streamer ego
[3:31:11] Miraelia: so much time was lost at beginning from bad spawn
[3:31:11] Austinnmh: Has anyone killed him yet?
[3:31:13] rathura: @Xaryu maybe the more blood he has the less he heals
[3:31:15] Firebirdjr: @Xaryu just get a cave filled with 60 warriors, have them charge and execute when he hits 20%
[3:31:15] DropsetGaming: they didn't clear? had to take a work call
[3:31:18] BlackMagick15: If you are less than 200 blood, go get more then come back
[3:31:20] LoosieJuice: @Xaryu i had bloods the whole time and still got Bruised -5.. i dont understand how that happened
[3:31:20] gloneiric: he takes more dmg. my mindblasts were hitting a lot harder
[3:31:26] realandtruephobe: @Hiebly This is not confirmed, and actually seems untrue. His health pool jumps at 20% regardless of the number of ears.
[3:31:26] tmacd: @Austinnmh no
[3:31:28] shalomski: Lots of plp at start barely had 1 blood let alone 100

[3:31:47] FatherOwens: he get the amount of hp during besekr based on how many people he has killed previously
[3:31:47] bigwolf1212: Xaryu are you going to play self found
[3:31:48] encrypteddeath: should you bring a warrior with mortal strike?
[3:31:51] CoolTV: probably has something to do with his trophies

[3:32:13] Fnafson: is tehre any eu streamer attempting this?
[3:32:13] RoosterBooster_: @Xaryu you need to try to have 3 dedicaded "tank groups" with like 2 tanks each and 3 healers and try to tank him somewhat, every swing he doesnt get a kill is a bonus to you
[3:32:17] CoolTV: trophies...
[3:32:19] 444xtina: don‚Äôt exclude people
[3:32:21] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: yep 100%
[3:32:22] kindaopmusic: i think the 3am strat is the play
[3:32:23] rathura: @xaryu maybe the more blood he has the less he heals
[3:32:23] bend0ver3: EU got the event in 13 min , BIg group going for it
[3:32:24] qc3rs: less ppl and better groups for sure
[3:32:25] purplejezusjuice: @Xaryu try a smaller group all with 200+ blood and see how it goes
[3:32:25] 444xtina: that guy is so annoying
[3:32:26] Reaperz_kinetic: @STREAMSNIPELUL this is 100% wrong

[3:32:30] mrlemons: You guys would have had it if the server could cope
[3:32:30] serverfirst300003: !gm
[3:32:31] bigsugg11: you have to kill him before he phases. BASICALLY.
[3:32:31] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: the first 10 minutes were almost completely wasted
[3:32:32] gloneiric: our layer took him to the altar on accident and healed him a lot which fucked us too
[3:32:33] DrSwole: @Xaryu The altar is what screwed you guys
[3:32:34] cookie_jayy: its impossible to heal with the lag LUL
[3:32:34] IanEdgerton: without the healing at the start you would have had that
[3:32:35] boolgogiking: so  LOA phased yesterday @ 20% but @ 15% today? what changed?
[3:32:35] bend0ver3: EU got the event in 13 min , BIg group going for it

[3:32:45] pairofsnax: melee is just dying to living bomb and explo shot so need like all casters lol

[3:34:26] teaspewn: Does the boss phase after a certain number of kills below a percent health? Is that why he was pushed farther?
[3:34:26] Heart042: 100% you have to DPS boss down to 20% for the health bump and then you have to start sacrificing your bloods/self to heal him back to full and force him to 'overheal' (due to new max health) and explode!
[3:34:26] cookie_jayy: you cant make a comp with random people showing up to the layer LUL

[3:36:44] Greeblez: You can't control the comp, builds, layers, bloods with a zerg. Work with what you have.

[3:37:15] teaspewn: @xaryu Does the boss phase after a certain number of kills below a percent health? Is that why he was pushed farther? Possible to check from vods?
[3:37:16] English_Uk: You dont want to be near an altar. Also uninvolving people by class will get it grief'd to high heaven.

[3:38:33] CoolTV: Bro imagine BEING a WARRIOR OMEGALUL
[3:38:33] dislor_d: do you think they would make a world boss were melee can‚Äôt hit it?
[3:38:33] nebby1122233: LF GNOMER . ROGUE PAYING 20G LUL
[3:38:33] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: melee should just kill all the people without bloods
[3:38:34] Reaperz_kinetic: @srrymyfingerslip we found the trash rogue or mage chat KEKW
[3:38:37] tacodoc: Wonder if you have to limit yourself to spells with little/no animation to keep the servers from crashing
[3:38:37] sammixi: it doesnt work staysafe just wants all warriors to kill themselves kekw
[3:38:37] BlackRe3per: Staysafe is COPED

[3:38:39] darkmagi2: @Xaryu Being melee feels like absolute ass in basically all content this phase except the raid
[3:38:40] itsbrysontv: xar why are you so negative against the idea? KEKW
[3:38:40] kindaopmusic: or mele just keep the peice, killing greefers
[3:38:42] stevierc: also got to think why the boss went down so quickly in the arena?
[3:38:43] ellyger: @bend0ver3 got a stream?
[3:38:44] ninetysix: damn no gnomer and no stv for us
[3:38:45] re1er: lag
[3:38:50] realandtruephobe: @kindaopmusic not a bad idea
[3:38:53] loafers6969: The best thing you can do as melee on the layer is kill the raid members who are low and scoop up 1400 coins ez
[3:38:54] Winttyrr: LuL no fuckin melee is getting 255 stacks on their own. we jus get farmed by hunters, spriests and ele shams
[3:38:54] Dareka1111: except it's not 1%... it's .01 that you cannot see
[3:38:56] Androllic: dude what if more bloods you have increase damage to boss and the more ears he gets the more he heals. you need to stack bloods and kite boss so he cant heal endlessly
[3:38:57] psircyen: @srrymyfingerslip xaryu faked twice and he still fell for it that guy was fucking awful
[3:38:57] Whip_xo: Standing near altar = heal boss. Maybe because the boss loses stacks? Meaning, more stacks on boss = kill boss?
[3:38:59] Eggzactly54: the gm alluded to sacrifice the first time
[3:39:00] depreciatedasset: Just got here, what % did it get to
[3:39:01] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: warriors are just waiting for them to actually be a viable class
[3:39:01] WhudaFxUp: Or... The lag is so bad, you can't tell where the damage is from
[3:39:03] frozzon: did u kill the boss?
[3:39:04] mrbeggin89: Any EU streamer trying?
[3:39:08] r4men_noodle: What did logs say?
[3:39:09] jaackski: You would also have no idea if the blood is doing 1% or your damage is. you're assuming its the damage
[3:39:10] Reaperz_kinetic: @srrymyfingerslip nope but nice try KEKW
[3:39:11] HunterericTV: 2 hrs 6 mins for SF
[3:39:14] Kenzu420: WARLOCKS WITH IMPS IS THE KEY MAN
[3:39:17] detourz28: Sad state of affairs for melee
[3:39:18] lastad94: wait Straysafe and Payo play together ?
[3:39:20] MorbidGunner: How are they griefers if they kill people trying to kill the boss...it's the point of stv
[3:39:28] Multirainbeau: What if 255 bloodstacks increases your damage?
[3:39:34] PineappleDuh: Why does bruised debuff stack?
[3:39:36] lalli1999: lalli1999 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:39:40] Poolhaus: wasnt it just hits max hp increasing?
[3:39:44] pliley: maybe you take less damaage with more stacks?
[3:39:45] shadowvypers: people will lose bloods going past the loa
[3:39:49] KosmicDevil_: wouldnt the gm have gotten aggro tho?
[3:39:49] bubblesthebelfwarrior: can u opt out of the pvp and still hit the boss?
[3:39:50] chrisrev: if you opt out you dont give blood
[3:39:55] iloveAly_: @bubblesthebelfwarrior yes
[3:39:57] Slyratt: maybe that was the gm increasing it‚Äôs hp
[3:39:57] Karev: @Xaryu  can you play slow the clip ?
[3:40:01] Nerdtron3000: Do both factions need to fight him together
[3:40:02] Nerdtron3000: ?
[3:40:05] iloveAly_: and you dont give blood if youre opted out
[3:40:12] its_Blocky: its because people were turning in their blood
[3:40:12] CaptainKelleyy: converting coins?
[3:40:13] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: yeah you gotta kill people without bloods
[3:40:14] baldanduseless: turn in blood in ghost with glasses ? @Xaryu
[3:40:14] Cantaloupez: isn‚Äôt the arena bad because of the altar
[3:40:29] MongoSecurity: WHAT IF you have to kill the oppoisite faction in front of him
[3:40:33] TortugaAtomico: @Nerdtron3000 They were doing that in the earler attempt
[3:40:35] limburgse: KEKW
[3:40:36] TransMutedMaya: just target the AOEers
[3:40:37] Nerdtron3000: One large group of both factions killing each othere AND the boss?
[3:40:39] Whip_xo: The boss dies by getting more bloods
[3:40:39] finnybae: LUL
[3:40:41] Aldever13: Self found today?
[3:40:42] Camosurfer21: Xar form a blood group to hold boss agree and everyone else stay far away and pump
[3:40:42] huktv: @Xaryu not sure if you remember me brother but i've been going through a tough time lately. just wanted to say hi and congrats on being a dad.
[3:40:43] the_doody: radiation potions? can you feed him poisoned sacrifices??
[3:40:43] YzieGG: u had 140 KEKW
[3:40:45] TransMutedMaya: if you kill AOEers you're doing a service anyway
[3:40:45] lemonarque: no its people who listened to you guys and only got 1 blood and went to 0 on their first death
[3:40:46] BrokenLorax: if you have no blood you should fight the others without blood
[3:40:47] CaptainGrodan: healed for like 9% several Times.
[3:40:53] HunterericTV: @Aldever13 ye, in just over 2 hrs
[3:40:59] ostreidiis: lol just bring melee to kill to farm u guys blood

[3:41:12] kokoMcgogo: Also if they have no mana
[3:41:13] Ophelly: there might be some information hidden in the Hinterlands, that's where you get the mallet for ZF, could possibly have something regarding him?
[3:41:14] CoolTV: Right, I remember Blizzard talking about an STV world buff, so that is probably it
[3:41:14] Chilliy: His Blood Leech heals him a ton
[3:41:15] realmalfurionsr: it saves them Repairs too!
[3:41:17] Fnafson: anyone from eu attempting this?
[3:41:18] jessuhcuhh: why are they theorycrafting when we already know you just need to have blood
[3:41:19] prfssrzaddy: Almost dead and oom, take the blood Kappa
[3:41:20] 5thD5thD: they dont take equipment damage either then

[3:41:42] mojitoboy92: Just gather like 1k people @xaryu
[3:41:44] huktv: @Xaryu hey. not sure if you remember me brother but i've been going through a tough time lately. just wanted to say hi and congrats on being a dad.
[3:41:46] Camosurfer21: Xar form 2 groups 1 opt in and 1 opt so the ones who have blood can hold boss aggro and rest can pump
[3:41:46] kindaopmusic: whats asmons take on it if any?
[3:41:46] tmacd: they dont want you to kill it
[3:41:53] r4men_noodle: Why would they nerf it though??
[3:41:53] SillyPanda: The problem is its really hard to tell whats happening with the lag so bad xD
[3:41:54] MrMowf: HES IN THE ARENA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  @xaryu
[3:41:55] Chilliy: Blood Leech 415 535 life drained, heals the caster aka the boss for double
[3:42:00] HunterericTV: surely the bloods would have did something when normally farming bloods
[3:42:04] CoolTV: this boss is meant to be killed I think
[3:42:05] Fnafson: no way its not killable
[3:42:05] xiClutchBoyix: do you maybe do more damage the more bloods you have?
[3:42:06] TundraSpice: who is the guy who isnt xar, payo or savix
[3:42:08] Nize2: i mean 10% is killable
[3:42:08] Psico_420: W Payo
[3:42:10] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: they're freakin out trying to make a loot table
[3:42:12] ferknasty: didnt they say in the dev interview its doable?
[3:42:12] marshalberge: i think its world boss for phase 3
[3:42:12] Helyraa: Is there any boss in ZG that has the same kind of mechanic?
[3:42:16] lylo_tv: PAY OMEGALUL
[3:42:17] feydzhan: which class for sf?
[3:42:17] kindaopmusic: LUL
[3:42:18] espi: Payo can't afford 5 subs but he can bet a cool million
[3:42:19] CoolTV: its 100% meant to be killed actually
[3:42:20] macjcool: STFU AMPHY LOL
[3:42:20] DirtyyFresh: I agree with Payo. Boss isn't meant to be killed
[3:42:20] Whip_xo: The boss dies by getting more bloods
[3:42:21] MightyCactus1: I think it is "killable" but it is not designed to be killed
[3:42:21] t3hfluff: OMG
[3:42:21] Camosurfer21: Xar form 2 groups 1 opt in 1 opt out
[3:42:23] reallyeric: im with payo, this boss isnt meant to be killed. there will be no loot lol
[3:42:24] chobinhood_: No way they would encourage getting 1000 people on a layer to kill it
[3:42:25] MrMowf: when he took those chunks he was actually down in the arena!
[3:42:27] MrMowf: when he took those chunks he was actually down in the arena!!!
[3:42:28] inhaledthc: can i see the clip
[3:42:29] Alacor: Boss isn't meant to be killed. Probably will drop nothing unless they change it now that people are trying for it
[3:42:33] PineappleDuh: you need to have more stacks of blood than u do bruised stacks
[3:42:36] realmalfurionsr: what if the more players around him the more health and more health regen?
[3:42:38] Psico_420: You know its bad when Payo is the most reasonable one LUL
[3:42:40] Miraelia: don't give ideas to blizzard bro, they have 2 hours to make it happen
[3:42:42] chobinhood_: prefarm
[3:42:45] nairBaicraG: too hard for normal servers to kill but maybe once hes killed for the first time he unlocks a mount at the vendor
[3:42:45] Reaperz_kinetic: @Alacor the boss is meant to be killed
[3:42:48] Whip_xo: You get way more bloods when you are near the boss
[3:42:48] UnsafeCell: "win trading"
[3:42:51] Skullkandy2933: @chobinhood_ Can't
[3:42:57] PortraitBot: What if they expected no one would kill it because the servers are garbage?
[3:42:58] tmacd: @Alacor Agree..otherwise the GM wouldnt get involved
[3:42:58] chobinhood_: @Skullkandy2933 wdym?
[3:43:00] Alacor: @Reaperz_kinetic Can you elaborate on why you think that?

[3:43:36] Fnafson: Spread might be the strat
[3:43:36] Wulftoon: pull up the logs
[3:43:38] Skullkandy2933: @chobinhood_ They'd run out of time, the boss is only up for 30 minutes so there isn't enough time to pre-farm bloods.  Bloods can only be collected during those 30 minutes
[3:43:39] cleavingwow: is there a disease you could apply to yourself to prevent you from getting health stolen or it hurts him
[3:43:39] TheMrGromble: Would full irradiated set be something that hurts him @Xaryu  Like Hakkar
[3:43:39] CitizenDesmond: @Xaryu Maybe you really do need a small elite group to kill him so he cant heal off of the whole raid
[3:43:42] EquinnoxAR: "Requires Untapped Target"
[3:43:42] bend0ver3: what if you allt ake off gear

[3:43:50] OloCdn: he's the blood loa he wants blood thast why when he kills you he sucks your blood out
[3:43:52] rawlexdota: Maybe that is the reason blood is capped at 250

[3:43:57] UnsafeCell: you need to poison yourself with engi bombs
[3:43:58] Joxtirol: i would be notes in normal event if it is case
[3:43:59] SlapdickWoWplayer: listen to Taylor Swift's Bad Blood while killing it. Easy
[3:44:00] mitsankladan: also check Blood Life Druid
[3:44:00] macjcool: do you leave blood poools in the arena or anytihng
[3:44:01] Alacor: @Reaperz_kinetic I don't think that's really enough to say that tho, but eh
[3:44:08] Reaperz_kinetic: @Alacor how isnt it LOL
[3:44:08] Django_7: @Xaryu doesnt it make more sense that if you have more blood he gets to leech more life, no blood nothing to leech
[3:44:09] tigerslap_ow: having blood might prevent him from taking from you
[3:44:09] Sncf18: YOURE ONTO SMETYHING WITH THE BLOODLEECH LIKE HAKKAR
[3:44:10] UnsafeCell: or event trinket
[3:44:11] realmalfurionsr: Can that get lower to 0? It says up to double which implies it could go down to 0
[3:44:12] Owendgg: @Xaryu Wouldn't be a thing to kite him endlessly? As he leeches health from ''nearby enemies''
[3:44:13] xrleire: PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT EU ATTEMPT send me a link please! I cant find one
[3:44:17] TheMrGromble: Would full irradiated set be something that hurts him @Xaryu  Like Hakkar
[3:44:18] Whip_xo: The boss dies by getting more bloods
[3:44:19] RoosterBooster_: @Xaryu you need to try to have 3 dedicaded "tank groups" with like 2 tanks each and 3 healers and try to tank him somewhat, every swing he doesnt get a kill is a bonus to you
[3:44:20] coldstout: staysafe is loud af turn him down :P lol
[3:44:21] Nimbus723: have a second layer try it out
[3:44:23] Seoken1: Perhaps you could also have the ranged cycle in/out as they pop CD's, so they are ONLY dps'ing while they are in 45yards, then step out
[3:44:24] UnsafeCell: poison yourself
[3:44:24] scottyice2593: self found
[3:44:24] keweiy: i spent entire day until time working and now tuning into this. this is genuine good content. way to go xaryu
[3:44:24] ScovieJ: If you do the same thing without changing tactics you're wasting the event too
[3:44:27] huffqq: would blizzard really make it that complicated?
[3:44:29] Reaperz_kinetic: were already wasting events by not killing him.. how is trying a new strat any different
[3:44:30] HoppsAlot: Overthinking it big time
[3:44:33] swidey221: everyone can get blood very quick if you just aoe for like 2 min next to boss @xaryu
[3:44:34] HoppsAlot: Y'all got it
[3:44:34] ironmouse34: I like the angle of the white items that have sayings on them .... there's gotta be a reason why those exist
[3:44:36] kenmi2: you can get blood from an event prior and don‚Äôt turn in
[3:44:40] bamfosaurus: @Xaryu I think the last attempt would have been a kill other than the lag and the fact that most people lost blood off rip when he was by altar
[3:44:42] pyledriver_ATX: Wasn't Hardcore SSF mode coming out today?
[3:44:43] enigmasvea: @Xaryu the mechanic is, get poisoned from the gnomer trinket
[3:44:45] Alacor: @Reaperz_kinetic It's not definitive and it can come off like they're maybe joking around about it
[3:44:46] Reaperz_kinetic: @ironmouse34 priest rune
[3:44:46] rarelune: can someone link me the GM clip from yesterday?
[3:44:47] lntuu: WHY DONT YOU HAVE 2 DIFFERENT LAYERS TRY 2 DIFFERENT THINGS
[3:44:51] r4men_noodle: You guys got this
[3:44:52] Fnafson: pull him closer to respawn off the bat
[3:44:57] MrMowf: blessing of the blood loa...a world buff you can get when you kill him?  guilds will join up together to kill him for the buff an low players wont be able to farm free honor?  o.O
[3:44:58] LueDawg: and not DC 7 times
[3:44:58] Fnafson: and make usre everyone has blood
[3:45:00] reallyeric: this boss is simply just not meant to be killed..
[3:45:03] pizzabudet1337: Maybe kill each other on purpose next to boss. Standing next to boss gives more blood than dying
[3:45:09] Reaperz_kinetic: @Alacor i mean they literally told him to go find out... thats pretty definitive.. maybe trolling but still
[3:45:09] ironmouse34: @Reaperz_kinetic which one?
[3:45:13] Whip_xo: 2 layers - 2 tactics
[3:45:14] inhaledthc: give ur blood in
[3:45:17] Nize2: the other layers would be full still, cuz they would be holding the leftovers
[3:45:20] Seoken1: if the server doesn't crash I think they can do it
[3:45:21] Fnafson: fuck that
[3:45:22] 3c3c_: KEKW
[3:45:23] jalgorithm: wtf

[3:45:24] CoolTV: Fuck melee EleGiggle
[3:45:24] Reaperz_kinetic: @ironmouse34 idk tbh i just know my guilds priest needed em for a rune
[3:45:24] poonti51: but he has multiple spawns. he‚Äôs made to be killed on each location somehow
[3:45:25] Nellz3r: locks?
[3:45:25] Seoken1: warlock
[3:45:26] lasershark1: FeelsBadMan
[3:45:27] cookie_jayy: Not including people is crazy

[3:45:30] xlineagefreek: big mage dps mando
[3:45:31] ttvnorbitaker: fatal
[3:45:32] gloneiric: imagine if this boss does give tiger.. imagine how bad servers will be for the next month.. i just don't see blizzard wanting this to be a thing
[3:45:32] BigTimeSnack: Next spawn gonna be ZG at 3, i'm calling it
[3:45:32] Bodhisage: Got 175 blood rdy o7
[3:45:33] macjcool: fuck those mages and there fires

[3:45:45] ironmouse34: @Reaperz_kinetic huh ... ok
[3:45:46] shadowvypers: should pick who you want and let the layers fill naturally after that so they can load balance
[3:45:46] chobinhood_: warlock dots are W
[3:45:46] poonti51: but he has multiple spawns. he‚Äôs made to be killed on each location somehow.
[3:45:48] hearingblockchain: bye scrub rogues
[3:45:48] macjcool: Mages were griefing
[3:45:49] ragnawk: meta world boss lmao
[3:45:53] Alacor: @Reaperz_kinetic It's not definitive at all though. They also wouldn't design the boss so that in order to kill it you need to bring the servers to their knees
[3:45:53] MEDICx87: spriest
[3:45:53] LueDawg: mages griefed the hell out of that last event

[3:49:05] legendaryvira: when will it spawn?
[3:49:05] pizzabudet1337: Maybe AOE each other next to boss start of the fight. Killing others next to boss gives more bloods than dying next to boss
[3:49:05] themadfeltcher: Boss being on beach griefed your ass too.  Those wards that summon skeletons had spawned a bucket load that were killing lots of people

[3:49:27] sebix182: @Xaryu you are very low volume
[3:49:28] MightyCactus1: Sunken Temple is where Hakkar  supporters infused green dragons with Hakkars blood to try to bring him back @Xaryu
[3:49:29] fooclyro: its just like the ashenvale drums buff

[3:49:49] knifeparty818: i had 36 blood this last event and i seem to have taken less damage compared to the others

[4:04:44] SamShawAZ: Servers are dying from a seperate issue right now xar, bad timing
[4:04:46] dae_bed: probably should switch layers
[4:04:48] brandogzz: for a bilion dollar company + 30 years of having the game out

[4:05:11] TransMutedMaya: or is it unrelated to EU
[4:05:14] skitna: i have thunder bluff all to myself
[4:05:15] ZaanSaidTheSun: you need to give melee token roles so they dont grief you out of spite, like protecting the ranged from mobs, and other griefers
[4:05:16] Mrmcgibblet: blizz‚Äôs greatest defense against killing him, their servers.
[4:05:17] Trenaur: THis is not going to work...you need to actually tank him.  I tanked him and could hold him when our guild did this.  We got him to 95%.  The problem is you're going to have other alliance and Horde killing your raid.  With no dedicated tank you 100% are going to have casters getting one shot.
[4:05:19] encrypteddeath: what do you do in the mornings called?

[4:06:25] YyTonyMa: SMOrc FOR THE GLORY
[4:06:25] realandtruephobe: The servers DCing is on Blizzard, not the streamers. People need to chill
[4:06:25] perturb25: @Xaryu once u enrage him there is a chest u need to find and loot
[4:06:26] shadowvypers: bragging rights world first
[4:06:27] Trenaur: Yeah this isn't Felreaver lol
[4:06:28] fcwar_: Fel Reaver was a quest though Kappa
[4:06:30] Astralthundr: it also doesnt explain why he was nerfed
[4:06:30] yetismoosh: You kill Gamon to know
[4:06:30] Androllic: I think having less dmg only hurts you Instead of cheesing the boss perhaps try to figure out the actually mechanics

[4:06:40] cxn_r: @subbyye so would you if you were popular
[4:06:41] chrislu18: can you get bloods in raid if opt'd in event?
[4:06:42] AC_madsen: i doubt he has loot but the glory is always worth it
[4:06:43] killawill707: there is another NPC boss you summon to help kill him
[4:06:44] sengip: There's a 0% chance it drops any loot. It's about the pride, but there is 0% chance it drops any loot. Data miners have already dug into it, it drops nothing
[4:06:45] Dareka1111: and what it drops
[4:06:46] Toopaid2freestyl: gotta find out
[4:06:46] timcurrying: bengal tiger is for sure a boss drop from phase 3
[4:06:47] YyTonyMa: Nah if anything he will give a Title to everyone involved, doubt it will be loot
[4:06:47] 13brill: For the glory!
[4:06:48] thatguydeew: @subbyye upset?
[4:06:48] nemcoy: "Lets not climb Mount Everest, i bet nothing is up there"
[4:06:49] bhoffey: so we need fel reaver to kill this boss? ggs
[4:06:49] Mrmcgibblet: 3s and a silk cloth would be so damn funny though
[4:06:51] shadowvypers: FOR GNOMERAGON1
[4:06:52] maurius86: server crashed again
[4:06:52] MrMowf: there is no debuff in the arena, no 20 sec wait time. for body rezzers, that was 100% true.     the idea that he is always approaching the arena i believe is also still true but if others say they saw him just chillin then w/e
[4:06:52] SlapdickWoWplayer: Kite him to outlands?
[4:06:53] Mico027: Season of discovering how you can crash the servers
[4:06:57] CIamzy: Servers can't handle it
[4:06:57] scottyice2593: self found
[4:06:57] jacobx9898: He will drop a tiger for sure, Hardened gloves of the Tiger
[4:06:59] Exusprime: Thrall didnt drop anything, we still killed him in TBC

[4:07:03] perturb25: @Xaryu once u enrage him there is a chest u need to find and loot
[4:07:05] Vulkanbunny: I have not played Wow for like 11 years and i still enjoy watching this and am rooting for you all to make this happen! <3
[4:07:06] ImCobra: how would it be looted though? everyone who tagged gets it?
[4:07:08] packtar: Well you pretty much had it even with lags and DCs and you had a pretty bad start.  People with no blood, bad spawn position etc
[4:07:08] PineappleDuh: @thatguydeew not upset? Just pointing out that there is definitely something we're missing
[4:07:08] Toopaid2freestyl: ITS ABOUT THE GLORY!
[4:07:09] CIamzy: Someone's gonna kill at 3am I guarantee it
[4:07:10] chr47: What if it drops 1k gold and a flying mount?
[4:07:12] brandogzz: Hes not meant too be killed i am pretty sure
[4:07:13] reallyeric: just pme bengal tiger or one fore everyone that hit it
[4:07:13] sengip: You guys are so dumb. It doesn't have a loot table.  Think theyre gonna give 500 ppl a mount for free?
[4:07:14] t0ny1992: imagine out of 500 poeple attacking the boss and it dies and ONLY 1 BENGAL TIGER drops lol
[4:07:14] artikfhjkl: Listening Listening Listening

[4:07:18] zartorak: should drop a murloc mount @Xaryu that be sick
[4:07:18] enigmasvea: EU has 0 lag EZ
[4:07:20] Zielepoot: We used to farm horde leaders weekly they didn't drop anything poor mf'ers
[4:07:21] zartuus: the only think we discover so far is that blizzard server are shit but we already know that
[4:07:21] callanayyz: i mean there was an actual. reason to kill fel reeaver
[4:07:22] MongoSecurity: @scottyice2593 Drops in about 2 and a half hours woooooo
[4:07:24] bann3ro: pretty sure he drops nothing if gm intervened and stopped it before lol. no inteded
[4:07:24] LueDawg: prolly gonna drop a rep quest and buff similar to drum P1 @Xaryu
[4:07:25] brandogzz: pretty sure hes not meant too be killed xaryu xddd
[4:07:26] Dareka1111: spawns another GM at 5% to increase health 1000%
[4:07:27] inhaledthc: 2 silver 5 linen cloth
[4:07:28] locolopezgg: Isnt the event in 1.5hr? why are you all still there? Just for the prep?
[4:07:36] jhopps12: @sengip for free? this look free to you? lmao
[4:07:37] lylo_tv: @sengip Clueless Surely we all bengal
[4:07:38] CIamzy: World first will be at 3am
[4:07:38] tism0ney: @t0ny1992 classic wow LOL
[4:07:39] Myflav0r: whens this going down again?
[4:07:48] Rybeon: Stop inviting people it's already way to much
[4:07:50] Philopinos: "already too may ppl" keeps making raids
[4:07:52] vihttz: @enigmasvea 1/10th the players EZ
[4:07:53] hearingblockchain: Get more people thats the best option
[4:07:54] Soccer_Bob: CAN I GET INVITE TO iflY
[4:07:54] plasticbus: Plot Twist - Kill blood loa and you start the WoW plague all over.
[4:07:55] SpaceCowboy0811: maybe spread out players? @Xaryu
[4:07:56] itshaboygaven: Anyone else hype about 6pm release of self made hardcore?
[4:07:57] OloCdn: isn't the lag going to hurt you more in the long run?
[4:08:06] hearingblockchain: Everyone get on crusader strike ally
[4:08:07] qc3rs: 100% less is more for this
[4:08:08] Malfunked38: hi
[4:08:09] Dr0ddy: 3AM full mage group
[4:08:09] jacobx9898: Wow BatChest
[4:08:10] MrMowf: no 20 sec debuff in the arena is very true.  hopefully that is where you get the spawn.   unfortunately the turn in is hard to avoid on people way in
[4:08:11] realmalfurionsr: @Xaryu Kha Damu is a druid type of npc, is there a way to force shapeshift him to prevent him from using abilities?
[4:08:11] Toopaid2freestyl: stand next to the priest mind visioning you so i can get a screen shot
[4:08:12] Memekin: then why are you still inviting
[4:08:15] cookie_jayy: I think your crazy to think people will not wake up at 3am to log on to do it
[4:08:15] ozzy_minaj: not the gatekeeping
[4:08:20] TixesDT: @Xaryu Dont invite ppl to same layer if you dont want server crashing. Also every unnecessary movement/char rotation/spell cast lags server exponentially for each player nearby. Avoid doing this things to redure lags and crashes. Server need to send your movement etc to everyone in your range and if 1000 ppl start moving its 1000^1000 data transfers.
[4:08:20] jacobx9898: just make the game more playable by less playing
[4:08:23] AwongTV: this is stupid yall are ruining the server ands both can play
[4:08:24] Purplexxityy: I like staysafes theory.. has a chance of working
[4:08:26] Seabrookx: @YyTonyMa Title is already datamined its "International Griefer" xD

[4:08:37] TMMOOF: anyone on that layer inviting Horde?
[4:08:37] joesworldttv: What layer is it?
[4:08:41] syleion111: when does the Event starts on your realm ? @Xaryu
[4:08:45] DilemmaSG: @Xaryu NUTSACCY IS LEAVING EVERY GROUP YOU MAKE AND JOINING THE NEW ONE
[4:08:45] Soccer_Bob: can i get an allieance invite to ifly please
[4:08:47] vejitas4: These streamers are in for a world of hurt melee grieferbwill fuck you up
[4:08:48] rubadubTV: All the best in slot classses
[4:08:51] hearingblockchain: Might as well just get as many ppl as possible so dont lose tag
[4:08:51] Jaivenx: :) :)

[4:09:00] gooshmagic2011: @Xaryu In stb arena the boss takes 15% more dmg but heals 50% more
[4:09:02] frozmageeu: your hair looks good like that
[4:09:02] rubadubTV: whats up dude
[4:09:03] bpwryl: The best strat would be to recruit people that promise to sit stormwind so that you and a few people can be in stv with less lag
[4:09:03] benjocre4m: waiting 1:30?
[4:09:05] GioBrothers: there is one more rogue in there
[4:09:06] yodaaxx: xar ur a beast brother @Xaryu
[4:09:06] yoeii: keep removing perturb hahaha
[4:09:06] kwantom75: 1 random rogue chilling hiding
[4:09:07] jacobx9898: LFM Rogues and Outcasts only Boss Defense raid
[4:09:09] zaff123: last rogue hoping he doesnt get seen lol\
[4:09:10] aluskyy: loa boss drops 3 silver and wool cloth EZ
[4:09:10] mr_coffa: If you can double the individual dps without lag, then you can just remove half og the people and still do same dps.
[4:09:13] Nimbus723: kind of a shame the only thing really keeping this from getting killed is the server tech
[4:09:15] kranish: what's going to happen?
[4:09:17] Bishox: @LueDawg they said no drum like item in p2 , called it bad design

[4:11:23] r4men_noodle: madseason!!
[4:11:28] itkbutt3rs: PANDORA!
[4:11:30] Whip_xo: Theory: Dying to the boss kills it. When he is near the altar, he loses bloods and heals. So if you have a lot of bloods and die to him, he dies quicker?
[4:11:31] OloCdn: You kill LOA and decard Cain walks out and asks you to stuff his cache
[4:11:31] auuzib: PLS
[4:11:32] surebuddd: You gotta bring the LOA to the COW LEVEL
[4:11:35] TixesDT: @Xaryu Dont invite ppl to same layer if you dont want server crashing. Also every unnecessary movement/char rotation/spell cast lags server exponentially for each player nearby. Avoid doing this things to reduce lags and crashes. Server needs to send your movement etc to everyone in your range and if 1000 ppl start moving server needs to start processing 1M data packets per char movement. And that is millions of packets a second = crash.
[4:11:35] hellajuiced: If you Kite Loa up a tree, takes 30% more dmg and drops Bengals

[4:12:37] Tuco30: @cxn_r this is so funny u should spam it more
[4:12:38] UhSpotInc: huh
[4:12:39] Nextp2w: @xaryu spammable channels like drain life/drain soul are pretty good against high level targets, b/c once you get past the initial resists you can channel for full duration with no partials
[4:12:39] tbseason: @Aludyx wow came out???? KappaPride
[4:12:41] StunningPaul: I just did a EU event where I saw 2 people near the boss total. Was a dead layer :(

[4:12:48] MrMowf: i had him aggroed to me for a whole 3 min in one event, standing ontop of a ruin.  he would occasionally charge one person and kill them, and then come back to staring at me
[4:12:50] LadySionn: did eu kill it?
[4:12:50] Whip_xo: @Xaryu Why not test 2 tactics on 2 layers?
[4:12:53] YyTonyMa: yeah, boss cant die Sadge
[4:12:55] whogivesashtt: the lag
[4:13:04] aluskyy: have you tried making it smaller

[4:13:07] waskaie: resists?
[4:13:08] yarrpeter: I cant imagine that its just a burn the boss down. I feel like theres gotta be something you have to do
[4:13:14] jbeemerks: kill his target to deny ears
[4:13:15] cxn_r: @xaryu my dad knows aggrends barber he said that if you twitch prime to your favourite streamer the boss will die

[4:13:24] TixesDT: @Xaryu Everyone has to reduce unnecessary movements. Just stay in place and press 1 button if possible. You need to explaing this to whole layer LUL
[4:13:27] kirk_hunts: Have we thought about kill all of these horde right here for glorious honor?
[4:13:29] artist_i: you missed the idea of why blizz don't want you to kill this boss that early
[4:13:31] Mico027: Sounds like you'll make it if you do what you just did but without wasting 10 mins near an altar
[4:13:31] YyTonyMa: My dad works for Exon-Mobil and he told me that the boss is immortal
[4:13:31] perturb25: @Xaryu there is probably a chest u need to loot on the map once he enrages or someone u talk to on zg island
[4:13:31] artist_i: maybe
[4:13:32] vihttz: I think if the boss wasn't meant to die, the GM wouldn't have came yesterday and aggrend wouldnt be memeing about it on twitter

[4:14:47] BujuArena: @Sysdemes not really, considering Blizzard has banned people and undone "exploited" kills like that before; world first Freya in Ulduar is one example
[4:14:47] Kenzu420: @Xaryu what about STV trinket "unleash a delayed explosion of blood and fire".....

[5:04:27] jbeemerks: it‚Äôs not even prime time lol
[5:04:29] dtz0r: You made evident that Blizzard needs to improve their potato computers for wow servers
[5:04:29] MrChaynes: its pathetic that blizzard wont fix this server performance issue
[5:04:30] SarcasticApe: Prayge drop a murloc costume
[5:04:31] ConnerIII: Hi Xaryu, I don‚Äôt need you. There are a whole lot of other WoW Streamers that deserve my time and support. As they say there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Fish without Wives too... you dummy.  I will no longer be dedicating 1/3 of my day to listening to your streams . Let the wildebeests roam... and if you need me, I‚Äôll be in Savix‚Äôs chat from now on. You may not know this but I actually do watch His streams after watching your streams. And I‚Äôve been a 6 month subscriber as well... I don
[5:04:32] crescenn: Thank you
[5:04:34] adam90k: i dont think you need any groups to kill it. You have way too many people
[5:04:36] lion_the_ryan: either that or this is what leads to blizzard finding a solution to lhe lag once and for all

[5:04:42] Stammey: i bet the boss wont spawn next try
[5:04:42] Kushiize: that server is clapped lmao
[5:04:47] stekkermane: Thanks to Sarthe & clowns co, the servers come to an absolute halt during STV because some big brains think they can kill a stage hazard. Blizzard needs to disable STV and put out a post that says this thing doesn't actually die so stop being absolute mongoloids.

[5:05:10] billco01: people just want you to kill it so we can play the game

[5:10:00] Disturbed_: @miciahclay How much easier is it for blizzard to claim an attack rather than admit their servers arent capable of this? The big issue here is that these servers are shared with hardcore players who are losing days of /played time so that this guy can get 2 linen cloth and 14 silver
[5:10:01] hearingblockchain: But people need to get bloods quickly before starting boss sommehow
[5:10:04] Nezhoni: @Luchoa3 HUH

Blizzard needs to disable STV and put out a post that says this thing doesn't actually die so stop being absolute mongoloids. Better yet, ban every who participated in this targeted cross server grief for disrupting gameplay Û†ÄÄ

[6:17:13] ceresmarkley: theory: stop griefing
[6:17:14] Valanya11: Ears make him take more dmg
[6:17:14] bluescholar1: what if  you need people with blood hitting him on PHASE 1 and then you need a whole other raid with the no-blood-buff you can get for PHASE 2
[6:17:14] PrewtaEU: it's not the arena. if anything. it's any altar.

[6:17:19] gumgargler: polar sends their regards
[6:17:19] lego_au: dieing to him with more blood makes him big?
[6:17:20] TheDeavs: @xaryu feed him all the blood after phasing and heal him to 100
[6:17:20] jme143kt: His kills
[6:17:21] Granteater4: Everyone was hitting harder when the blood turn in started
[6:17:21] theliteralsupreme: 20k
[6:17:21] tuna_sandw1ch: 19 MILLION BOOMKINS
[6:17:21] greenmanalpha: he gets bigger from killing
[6:17:21] UnmasteredPvP: wasn't the GM dragging him towards the arena or an altar when they were tanking before? Maybe tried to hint that this is the right idea
[6:17:21] kirk_hunts: Ours was HUGE in North STV on Layer 3
[6:17:22] jme143kt: make him bigger

[6:17:25] Tommyb_nyc_5: LOL these guys
[6:17:25] nyx100: it's just a big dumb boss with a 45y area wide drain, you guys overthing it, just dps
[6:17:26] Ophelly: Seems like you were doing more damage but only after turning blood with the bruise debuff. At the end you didn't turned blood after rezzing and were doing normal damage
[6:17:26] K3tchup_33: maybe he just gets big at 20%
[6:17:26] exizee: I say the strat is to all play Homunculi and press at the same time right when Warriors can execute/SPs too next attempt @Xaryu
[6:17:26] RAM__: Delete WTF Folder and he takes 2x damage
[6:17:27] BeardedDADPlaysAMage: you all need to farm blood for one go
[6:17:27] nailerak: theory: stop theorizing and DPS him
[6:17:28] flintstarr: @imdblum because I can be happy for someone else besides myself. Not that hard to figure out
[6:17:28] Heartofc: POLAR SENDS THEIR REGARDS
[6:17:28] blind_optimist: after he phases he takes more damage and gets bigger after kills
[6:17:28] teaspewn: Check your details and see if your casts started hitting harder over time
[6:17:29] knightmaucf: great, ive been watching 5 mins of ads so far
[6:17:29] Baby_Alan: does he get bigger the more time goes on
[6:17:29] sarahuckabee: nerds in chat seething
[6:17:30] ColePowerz: bruh layering is messing this
[6:17:30] hitchenstv: We got the BOSS to turn in
[6:17:30] Coorslite619: is the blood moon right above the arena?
[6:17:31] MrMowf: arena without Timer is definitely a big boost to DPS
[6:17:31] hearingblockchain: Turning in has something to do with it. He needs to be bigger
[6:17:31] CIamzy: EARS EARS EARS
[6:17:31] PaperbackWritter: the arena made it easier to everyone target it
[6:17:32] AkillianSNJ: Also a damage buff was datamind awhile back but no one knows if you can proc it

[6:17:35] kingeider: kite him to stormwind
[6:17:35] English_Uk: Why call out to kill each other... More people alive lower = kill boss faster
[6:17:36] azov_uax: @Heartofc pog
[6:17:36] shadowvypers: you would have gotten it if not for griefers
[6:17:36] Del_WoW: @xaryu most of the stuff peeps are talking about is pure cope. The amount of server lag is causing SOO much delay that in the 30 minutes you guys are really getting 20 minutes of dps uptime.
[6:17:36] camerondota2: DID IT DIE
[6:17:37] justjabl: he only gets bigger under 20%
[6:17:37] Cryof53: More bloods turned into the altar, more dmg the boss takes? So having ppl turn bloods in the entire time?
[6:17:37] amBaked: why would making him bigger make the fight easier tho?
[6:17:37] cookie_jayy: LUL yall gunna burn the damn pot

[6:17:41] Mico027: @Xaryu I noticed that when it reaches 20% it gains 1 milion HP per minutes left to the event, last time it was 17 millions when it was 17 mins left, this time it was 13 millions with 13 mins left
[6:17:42] lateloll: holy cringe :DDD

[6:17:43] mylittlehombre: imagine being a nerd in polar
[6:17:43] GeorgeDynamite: You have to let him get massive at the start, then fight him with blood on you
[6:17:45] kickflipy: @Xaryu What if when he targets someone, THAT person has to donate the bloods... like stand near altar, and donate if you get targeted..
[6:17:45] slashrhc: slashrhc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Solid attempt! gg

[6:18:02] Flermicus: how could you control that
[6:18:03] Armaerei: Maybe at 20% he stops healing and gets more HP. So you're really doing like 10m dmg getting him there because of healing.. then 14 mil without healing from there.
[6:18:03] wulfgar___: for this
[6:18:04] morfius09: i think he doesnt heal from no blood players, but from players that are not opted in. and turning in blood boosts your dmg to him
[6:18:04] emosoda: asmon isn‚Äôt a streamer, just a dirty hobo
[6:18:05] ikerislock: Killing themselves is not the play

[6:20:50] rubadubTV: @Xaryu you guys were farming each other during the burn phase, when everyone had the most damage from bruised
[6:20:51] realandtruephobe: It does NOT fall off offline
[6:20:52] HiddenChin: IT DOES NOT FALL OFF WHILE OFFline 100%
[6:20:52] exizee: I say the strat is to all play Homunculi and press at the same time right when Warriors can execute/SPs too next attempt @Xaryu .
[6:20:53] AleDoing: it stay

[6:21:03] perfectz94: arent you gunna play self found when it launches in 20 mins @Xaryu
[6:21:04] giftcarding: @Xaryu smaller group, get lots of bruise, die a lot, rez and kill
[6:21:04] chetterbancettv: What does bruise do?
[6:21:04] exizee: I say the strat is to all play Homunculi and press at the same time right when Warriors can execute/SPs too next attempt @Xaryu
[6:21:04] ScryerTV: Stormwind keep = one shot
[6:21:05] xSnapIt: check it on the mobs
[6:21:06] timcurrying: i got 16 bruised stacks
[6:21:08] fisseface: does that mean you can speed run Gnomer with a lot of Bruised stacks right after an event?
[6:21:08] ttvnorbitaker: it‚Äôs the arnea
[6:21:08] xSnapIt: random mobs
[6:21:10] timcurrying: did not do more damage
[6:21:10] cookie_jayy: It is a placebo
[6:21:11] ttvnorbitaker: I‚Äôm telling yoy
[6:21:11] Ophelly: Idea: you only get damage buff if you turn blood with the bruise debuff - have to repeat after death
[6:21:12] realandtruephobe: NOOOOOO
[6:21:12] ObrezKnight: Chat confirms
[6:21:12] aRedBean: phase 1 don‚Äôt turn in blood // phase 2 turn in blood @xaryu
[6:21:12] Amoxychillen: Being in a raid group reduces your stats. The purpose is to make you die faster. you are supposed to be in a raid group!!! Irradiated set reduces your stamina. Mildly Irradiated Potion makes you take 100% more damage(edited) all professions have a method of doing self inflicted damage to yourself. gnomer drops several items which deal damage to yourself, helping you kill yourself faster
[6:21:13] Nize2: i say we have warriors waiting outside stacked and then they run in at phase 2 Kappa
[6:21:15] kirkloden: Blizz trolling y‚Äôall
[6:21:16] Whip_xo: @Xaryu IT'S ALL ABOUT SACRIFICE. DYING WEAKENS HIM. BLOOD NEEDS TO BE DONATED.
[6:21:16] English_Uk: How about NOT calling for people to kill each other. Maybe more people on the boss is better..... Lets not over think it.
[6:21:16] ttvnorbitaker: ITS THE ARNEA
[6:21:17] exizee: I say the strat is to all play Homunculi and press at the same time right when Warriors can execute/SPs too next attempt @Xaryu .
[6:21:18] lilCasua1: what level do you have to be to join guys?
[6:21:18] mageguy8: elisBall what about just 2x damage in phase 2
[6:21:18] lilgimpy: GO TEST GO TEST GO TEST GO TEST GO TEST
[6:21:19] 00Absurd: it would make sense thematically to bring him into the arena
[6:21:19] „Öú„Äá‰πÇÂ∑•„Ñ∑: that wud make no sense no way theyre gnna kite him there
[6:21:20] korashii_: we all stack inside the arena
[6:21:20] zomnipotent: they're not gonna use arena when the spawn is random you dumbasses
[6:21:21] Riji07: anything to do with the ear caps?
[6:21:21] Copertone: he has a lore connection with the arena
[6:21:21] saltdalt: xaryu you did a 1977 non crit arcane surge
[6:21:21] eygton: did you down him
[6:21:22] SirtyStan: Are you planing on starting Self-Found when it launches?
[6:21:23] timcurrying: definitely the arena
[6:21:24] Epilate: should have like 40 warriors unboon at 20% and spam execute
[6:21:24] erhgeizvr: --- yall still talking about doing it but  world first is done ---
[6:21:25] eightyeight80: these COPIUM theories

[6:21:30] haglord_wow: dawg stop coping
[6:21:32] naturalduck: its not the arena, nessingwary spawn got him below 20%
[6:21:32] exizee: I say the strat is to all play Homunculi and press at the same time right when Warriors can execute/SPs too next attempt @Xaryu
[6:21:33] yumyumchubs: damage only accelerated after he berserks

[6:21:37] HiddenChin: ya
[6:21:37] A1K_GAMING: def not the arena
[6:21:38] Corndogman: @xaryu when we handed in all bloods the boss didnt heal this has nothing to do with bloods its the bruide stacks
[6:21:39] Koy_Boy: ITS NEAR AN ALTAR??????
[6:21:40] skytzi: they expect you to drag him to stormwind
[6:21:40] nanashi6_: maybe in other spot he can take more dmg
[6:21:40] Epilate: warlocks should try drain soul at 20%
[6:21:41] ragnof_: maybe its designed for only arena spawn
[6:21:42] Aldever13: https://clips.twitch.tv/BrightObservantClipsmomAliens-tg_GFqBf0Pv8OIPC

[6:21:45] DJr0711: it spawns near altars, its gotta be something with an altar
[6:21:46] Whip_xo: IT'S ALL ABOUT SACRIFICE. DYING WEAKENS HIM. THE WHOLE EVENT IS ABOUT BLOODSPILL. BLOOD NEEDS TO BE DONATED. @Xaryu
[6:21:46] Epilate: warlocks should try  drain soul
[6:21:46] MrMowf: BRUISED = only when you die to him.    BRUISED = you drop more blood when you die. thats all.
[6:21:46] Amoxychillen: Being in a raid group reduces your stats. The purpose is to make you die faster. you are supposed to be in a raid group!!! Irradiated set reduces your stamina.

[6:21:47] Xgeonmar: 15 million hp
[6:21:48] ggbr0sky: bro they dont intend to kill it at all like wtf
[6:21:48] Baron_Colvin: Maybe greater damage near altar?
[6:21:48] ttvnorbitaker: ITS THE BEST STRAT AND IT MAKES SENSE TO FIGHT THE STV BOSS IN ARNEA
[6:21:49] Xgeonmar: doable
[6:21:49] pezjunkee91: What about the ZG island?
[6:21:50] pmanfit91: The boss patrols. He'll end up near the Arena anyway.
[6:21:50] osopolar1977: Take em to ZG!!

[6:22:05] yashatheboi: My bruised debuff on my alt has stayed I've been logged out for hours
[6:22:05] Del_WoW: @xaryu everything about buffs and debuffs is pure cope. if you are having 3-5 second delays, you will never do it. the reason that other events have been faster on the front end, is because you have less people in a lagless scenario with full dps uptime.
[6:22:05] theblupps: @Xaryu  Bruised - Apply Aura: Dummy Value: 101 PVP Multiplier: 1 Server-side script
[6:22:06] newworlder229: blizzard probably doesnt expect anything, its not supposed to be killed most likely
[6:22:08] ybrouillard: He takes dmg sub 20%
[6:22:08] jandoodle2: it has to do with the shrines it makes sense u need to offer him more bloods thats the whole point no
[6:22:10] juice42069: FFS its not bruised stacks
[6:22:10] gangletronic: @Xaryu have you tried being in raid groups BUT OPTED IN -- maybe the debuff does something
[6:22:10] purplejezusjuice: maybe he takes more damage near altars?
[6:22:10] gindua: @Xaryu shrink ray him
[6:22:11] jakerose07: maybe warriors arent so trash now
[6:22:11] osopolar1977: Take em to ZG
[6:22:12] stroobzbeats: @Xaryu what if you just emote at him, maybe there's a random /bow mechanic
[6:22:13] leiferikson4541: Did you guys kill?
[6:22:13] Nize2: i say we have warriors waiting outside stacked and then they run in at phase 2 Kappa
[6:22:13] brahmanes97: or maybe blizzard intends for you not to kill it ever think that LUL
[6:22:14] solodegen: so you for sure want melee if thats the case
[6:22:14] dumpdeer: can we take our gear off and get bruised stacks?
[6:22:15] Luciant86: this boss isn't meant to be killed
[6:22:16] Guenhyvar_: i doubt its bruised
[6:22:16] Decimas1: take gear off at start
[6:22:16] kesoiscrazy: He is not ment to be killed
[6:22:16] paulthecat: maybe he just takes more dmg when he is at 20%
[6:22:17] Malganuss: its could be once he gets 255 ear stacks he takes more damage
[6:22:17] DobsonWireless: the location doesn‚Äôt matter but the alters do matter since he spawns by ONE of them @xaryu
[6:22:18] Zerksyera: keep dying
[6:22:18] sushileafbeats: check reddit
[6:22:18] Whip_xo: IT'S ALL ABOUT SACRIFICE. DYING WEAKENS HIM. THE WHOLE EVENT IS ABOUT BLOODSPILL. BLOOD NEEDS TO BE DONATED.
[6:22:19] AdamNicholsMusic: the bottom line is youre not meant to kill him. They are not going to make a killable world boss needing 7k people @Xaryu
[6:22:20] KosmicDevil_: do u know what a bruise is irl
[6:22:20] Zafumbalicio: so you group up so you can all die to swipe
[6:22:20] ERIZEL: At 20% I think he takes more
[6:22:21] Diddi21: yes this is all intended :)
[6:22:21] ComradeWarners: @xaryu Check Details!
[6:22:21] dips_ttv: Can I bring bruised into gnomer, asking for a friend?
[6:22:21] ybrouillard: He takes dmg sub 20
[6:22:22] DilemmaSG: he takes more stacks based on his own stacks im pretty sure, not brused @Xaryu
[6:22:22] Nize2: have warriors waiting outside stacked and then they run in at phase 2 Kappa
[6:22:22] ttvnorbitaker: the Arnea is the best strat bc he runs up and down
[6:22:22] Dtectv2: Seems like horrible game design to have to repeatedly suicide to a boss KEKW

[6:22:25] hitchenstv: 5Head @Del_WoW
[6:22:25] Perkasetz: need testing phase
[6:22:26] lilgimpy: maybe when he enrages he takes double

[6:22:37] Heavnlywrath: do it naked
[6:22:37] eastbaygs: Any one noticed that his namu Khadamu is backwards U Mad Ahk (bro)?!?‚Äô

[6:22:40] BoonesHQ: FiveHead
[6:22:40] cabo_chris: is bruising better than gear?

[6:28:33] pmanfit91: What percent did EVERY layer get him to?
[6:28:33] TrapAlt: At this point, its almost certainly something to kill the Blood God, since blizz has not made any kind of announcement while servers are struggling
[6:28:34] Andikun: were trying to brute force it but no way blizzard would make it this difficult
[6:28:34] Skurai21: I really dont think the griefers did that much he stopped healing in the second phase

[6:28:37] Hoffepoff: @Xaryu When is SSF?
[6:28:38] exizee: use greenches @Xaryu
[6:28:40] morfius09: i think he doesnt heal from no blood players, but from players that are not opted in. and turning in blood boosts your dmg to him
[6:28:41] benjaminmathias: @Xaryu less people means more bruises for everyone ))

[6:30:10] nyx100: it's because its leech is an aoe that hits everybody
[6:30:11] rissel: yeeeah because with more ppl he gets more ears and bigger hp buff
[6:30:16] schubertcs: 4 guilds from eu went togehter, and killed it last night, it didnt look that hard @Xaryu

[6:30:35] ybrouillard: at 20%
[6:30:38] ressecup87: yea, thats what I said earlier... dont do so many people. Let it happen naturally.
[6:30:39] cookie_jayy: if he was meant to be killed it wouldnt require the whole server
[6:30:39] Miraelia: if you remove all the griefers it's more efficient
[6:30:40] ybrouillard: simple as that
[6:30:40] vhanzom: less griefers
[6:30:41] Hoffepoff: @Xaryu Which server is SSF? new one?
[6:30:42] Kingconn223: what does he even give you for killing him?
[6:30:43] gh00775: you can‚Äôt out damage the hp
[6:30:43] Kaekias: hydras layer crashed multiple times, too
[6:30:44] giloratix: only 100 Kappa
[6:30:44] Happybrawler: just go as 40 man
[6:30:44] HiddenChin: Still sounds like ther eis aa mechanic missing.
[6:30:45] Whip_xo: @Xaryu IT'S ALL ABOUT SACRIFICE. DYING WEAKENS HIM. THE WHOLE EVENT IS ABOUT SPILLING BLOOD. BLOOD NEEDS TO FLOW.
[6:30:45] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: there's gotta be some equilibrium for lag and damage
[6:30:46] Nappycans: and less people trying to kill you
[6:30:47] Riji07: but wont it still lag if depending other
[6:30:48] Xgeonmar: 2 grps? 1 for pvp to collect blood 1 for boss?
[6:30:49] hdvision0803: dude it‚Äôs the griefers nothing else
[6:30:49] yaybump: YOU NEED WARRIORS FOR EXECUTE @Xaryu
[6:30:49] sushileafbeats: according to your reddit you hit 23k viewers, is that the highest?
[6:30:50] osopolar1977: ya
[6:30:50] Flarkenstone: Less people is more stacks per person
[6:30:52] English_Uk: your a streamer its never going to happen for you
[6:30:53] schubertcs: 4 guilds from eu went togehter, and killed it last night, it didnt look that hard @Xaryu
[6:30:54] xenev: yeah the grifers we're kinda insane
[6:30:57] Choopaloop: I couldnt connect on layer 3 for 80% of the event
[6:31:00] DilemmaSG: i havent seen anyone tank it without dieing in one shot @Xaryu
[6:31:01] Natural20Percent: Yall know you are crashing the Hardcore servers when you organize this shit right?
[6:31:02] Gabe4D: @xaryu what class are u running for SF HC?
[6:31:05] ybrouillard: It's litterally 20% he ramps up and we get 2-3x more dmg
[6:31:05] xAcaelus: @Xaryu what does bruised debuff even do?
[6:31:06] MrStLouis68: @Xaryu just pre-record tomorrow's stream and do it pseudo offline ;)
[6:31:07] lohktar22: 100% nothing drops
[6:31:08] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: just make a raid of warriors, they come in at 20% and start executing
[6:31:09] Bastelhex: its nothing
[6:31:11] ramfunky: Does the amount of blood you have increase your damage on him?
[6:31:11] MoastaJ: does he one hit everything?
[6:31:11] morticianbuera: no mount just coins
[6:31:12] Chrigss: @schubertcs is there any proof of that
[6:31:14] fijimann: @sushileafbeats he had 50+ when he casted the OTK duel event
[6:31:14] limburgse: 24 silver and 7 silk cloth is the drop

[6:31:22] PaperbackWritter: no one datamined it?
[6:31:23] bellyguud: @Xaryu u look tired my man, take it easy
[6:31:24] Jaxxiom: wowhead says "Players in his proximity will receive significantly more Blood for the Blood Loa for kills, so it is encouraged to fight around him."  -- too many focused on PVP, not on boss
[6:31:24] willcantstream: rogue???
[6:31:24] Griff_666: Just got Banned selling gold LOL FUCK THIS GAME MONTHS OF WORK GONE
[6:31:25] Governoor: Whats SF?

[6:31:30] youngkarlitos: yo can i post 1 link please xar?
[6:31:31] SaltyQQ: is there no datamining on this boss?
[6:31:31] Androllic: did you down it?
[6:31:33] xenev: if anything bruised sounds like it would make you do LESS damage, no? Or take more damage?
[6:31:35] EyeFromWyoming: 3 silver 1 silk cloth. but I respecvt your attempts
[6:31:37] iCeremony: Always love the content dude - great entertainment as always
[6:31:37] Honax_Official: The bruised debuff doesnt fall off when offline, confirmed on Savix' stream
[6:31:37] artarvio: chat did they kill the blood god?
[6:31:39] Ableton_EU: @Xaryu when are you going to play sf? when does it start?
[6:31:43] BigTimeSnack: Do the AOE trinkets from the stranglethorn pvp vendor have anything to do with it? They all say they have an "explosion of blood"
[6:31:43] mythicplusaddict: 40 man at 100 dps is 7.2mil damage in 30mins
[6:31:44] Whip_xo: Bruiser might mean you can't be charged by the boss again?
[6:31:44] Chrigss: @schubertcs youtube?
[6:31:45] Miraelia: @xaryu so much time would have been saved without griefing
[6:31:46] justjabl: the debuff is cosmetic
[6:31:47] pproffit: how much honor to get from rank 3 to rank 5
[6:31:47] stroobzbeats: @Xaryu I love this whole world boss thing, THIS IS DISCOVERY, so happy the answers not just sitting on wowhead
[6:31:48] osopolar1977: You get a tiger Wrestling Cloak
[6:31:48] CyberSkeLetor: when does the self found mode start?
[6:31:48] MoastaJ: @artarvio nope
[6:31:49] boolgogiking: do you think someone else will kill it before you log in tomorrow??
[6:31:51] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: how many bruised stacks is sardaco gonna have tomorrow
[6:31:52] Dahlialol: Simply the boss is intended for boosting the blood gained, not killing.
[6:31:53] Brewsy_: When did he enlarge?
[6:31:53] ech0cide: @Griff_666 don't go against ToS?
[6:31:55] Brewsy_: and why
[6:31:58] ScryerTV: SF HYPE
[6:31:59] giftcarding: @Xaryu less people more bruises, kill boss
[6:32:00] Androllic: so theres mechanics to figure out
[6:32:01] schubertcs: @Chrigss On reddit
[6:32:01] HYWFD: Will I be able so play SF if im from Barcelona? @Xaryu

[6:32:11] Valeeraw_: KEKW
[6:32:12] Ervill1: Reach
[6:32:12] kebbin: Blood Loa
[6:32:13] priestialityg: Xar have you seen Jimmy: World of Warcraft story? absolute banger o.g. wow tale, 7 mins
[6:32:13] Bigslappyx: does SF have fresh servers?
[6:32:14] probeu: ctrl F blood
[6:32:14] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: go to boss mechanics
[6:32:15] actualreallifebillionaire: we need slaves?
[6:32:16] slenderock: do u think it will drop item for everyone who participated?
[6:32:17] Ev0hz: gotta read it at all man kappa

[6:32:19] neighbours_wifi: Good night xaryu from Sweden
[6:32:20] Alaxtraz232: lol
[6:32:21] hubbardhs: spend an hour reacting to wikipedia pages
[6:32:21] youngkarlitos: yeah look at the part with the ritual
[6:32:22] osopolar1977: GWA Gwa
[6:32:23] asloff: man's doing a deep dive
[6:32:23] Saul_Rightman: Foil cap
[6:32:24] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu remember what the GM said? he appreciates your sacrifice, blood for the blood god. I think you're meant to feed him FIRST, just get him super juiced, then you burn him down. Everyone gets bruised, hes juiced. Iunno.
[6:32:26] stroobzbeats: this is the biggest SoD W so far
[6:32:28] Hoffepoff: Fresh servers for SSF? :o
[6:32:29] cookie_jayy: That article may tell you how to kill it
[6:32:31] justjabl: the debuff is cosmetic to show how many times you died to the boss
[6:32:31] Cryof53: more blood turn ins = more dmg boss takes? have people turning in bloods the entire time while keeping 1?
[6:32:34] thecptcotton: the boss heals x amount per player around. less players would heal him less
[6:32:35] ZkayTV: O/
[6:32:35] xAcaelus: @Xaryu you provided a great stream today go be family man xar now
[6:32:38] Al0rtin: did they kill the boss?
[6:32:39] Monsowhs: Do crtl f blood
[6:32:42] absolute3x: all my homies speeed read
[6:32:43] HavarV: Good attempt @Xaryu Good night from Norway!
[6:32:43] gindua: @Xaryu shrink ray him
[6:32:44] MrMowf: there is zero confirmed indication that Bruised gives dmg buff.  "bruised" is an old DnD effect that increases "bleeding" or "bludgeon"  only thing i can confirm it effects is the amount of blood you drop when you die. which makes 110%
[6:32:51] ramfunky: WE MUST GATHER OUR GREATEST SCIENTIST
[6:32:52] osopolar1977: Anyone remember Forsen boys
[6:32:52] ryuzakilightyagami: Quick duels
[6:32:52] Whip_xo: @Xaryu IT'S ALL ABOUT SACRIFICE. DYING WEAKENS HIM. THE WHOLE EVENT IS ABOUT SPILLING BLOOD. BLOOD NEEDS TO FLOW.
[6:32:52] zetmii: how long are you guys going to hold the server hostage with lag
[6:32:53] Brewsy_: When did he Enlarge in size and why?
[6:32:55] myyrlidon: love your streams i watch you everyday in school
[6:32:55] idiotferaltko: its simple...its not spose to be killed till lvl 60!
[6:32:57] Reaperz_kinetic: what we need to do is also pre stack max bloods
[6:32:59] JediRodilver796: Loved the content today bro. Don't let the haters get to ya
[6:32:59] youngkarlitos: @Xaryu look at the section with the ritual
[6:33:01] Mico027: @Xaryu I noticed the amount of HP he gains at 20% equals 1 millions times the amount of minutes left of the event, like this time it got 13 millions at 13 minutes left and last time it was 17 millions at 17 mins left
[6:33:01] MerxDaBeast: Xar lemme borrow 10g
[6:33:01] meazey3: monkaHmm what class to play in ssfhc
[6:33:02] reggie_dev: what time tomorrow?
[6:33:02] zomnipotent: @xaryu my dad is ceo of blizz he said u gotta send me gold to beat loa
[6:33:04] ybrouillard: bruise is useles, he gets bigs regardless
[6:33:05] Mobely__: STREAMER BOSS
[6:33:05] Doolie27: @xaryu btw josh aggrend responded to a tweet about the blood god, and he didn't say to not try it
[6:33:06] osopolar1977: Naw get bunch of Lvl 1
[6:33:06] Miraelia: @xaryu need to determine if juicing the boss is from start or only phase 2
[6:33:06] voidtouched_93: @zetmii long enough for you to quit hopefully
[6:33:07] Phil4242: hi
[6:33:08] squidgeymane: ngl I thought the boss would just stay at 1hp and not die
[6:33:10] juscallmezane: you going to play SSF today?
[6:33:11] waterbottle4511: @Xaryu Maybe take him to the water when he hits 20%?
[6:33:14] Reaperz_kinetic: @xaryu PEOPLE NEED TO PRE STACK BLOODS AND SAVE THEM
[6:33:14] HYWFD: Will I be able to play SF now if Im from Barcelona? @Xaryu
[6:33:15] Xgeonmar: LEAKED
[6:33:18] foresterny: i'm logged out at guru with 19 stacks ready to hop back in and get more
[6:33:20] exizee: kite him to sunken temple and kill @Xaryu
[6:33:21] youngkarlitos: @Xaryu look at the section with the ritual!!
[6:33:22] novalockk: He dies tomorrow
[6:33:22] paladan_tich: did they get it?
[6:33:22] am_egg: @Xaryu I only had two bruised, and my average damage is double below 20% idk if that had impact. I have my details and still only 2 stacks currently on me
[6:33:26] MrMowf: @xaryu there is zero confirmed indication that Bruised gives dmg buff.  "bruised" is an old DnD effect that increases "bleeding" or "bludgeon"  only thing i can confirm it effects is the amount of blood you drop/lose/give other players when you die.
[6:33:28] ScryerTV: Stormwind keep one shot from boss?
[6:33:29] osopolar1977: Get a Bunch of Lvl 1 raid
[6:33:33] Sharkiiiz: link the aggrend tweet that he replies to it
[6:33:34] theDRG: Outside of server issues I dont think the number of people are supposed to matter, its an open world event
[6:33:34] PMA_1: next time use Time to die WA https://wago.io/2o0Pz_GWT
[6:33:35] tmacd: won‚Äôt happen GM‚Äôs won‚Äôt let you when ‚Ä¶yet
[6:33:35] gindua: @Xaryu shrink ray him
[6:33:35] Scarecroll: they killed it?
[6:33:36] Aldever13: @Xaryu, SF in 10 min
[6:33:36] lordextraordinary: @Xaryu warlock only to kill boss, spam hellfire
[6:33:36] Vernion: Rogue for SF, but which race/side? I planned on going priest/mage with tailor enchant
[6:33:38] Plusem: @squidgeymane Love the videos man
[6:33:43] MoastaJ: go @9 for less people
[6:33:45] Chleocat: LEEK PepeLaugh
[6:33:46] xenev: bruised sounds more like a negative thing not a positive thing. sounds like a placebo people saying it amplifies damage
[6:33:47] freshlymantv: SF UP
[6:33:50] AceOfFlame: it doesnt
[6:33:50] ZkayTV: @xaryu What if we all give him HIV? Maybe he'll die faster
[6:33:52] NalxTV: I think they should nerf it, cuze how can an average player be able to make that big of a raid and kill it, if it drops a mount
[6:33:52] naturalduck: maybe that bruised does nothing
[6:33:53] cookie_jayy: Bruised does nothing
[6:33:53] entropyy6: xaryu do you think he heals after 20%? I didn't see any heals even though you all handed blood. Are you meant to tank him at alter like the GM was after 20%?
[6:33:53] MindWaveGG: @Xaryu Can you test if Bruise Boons?
[6:33:54] justjabl: bruise stacks are cosmetic is his point
[6:33:55] Ervill1: Enraged just increases DMG taken
[6:33:55] krupp825: No, Bruses does nothing. All DMG is increased at Phase 2.
[6:33:56] LootNShootTV: Just say a Reddit post explains that the boss name spelled backward is umad ‚Äúahk‚Äù which is Arabic for bro lol. Blizzard boss troll
[6:33:56] GoldenKingGK: I missed it. Did you win?
[6:33:57] ChristoxCrousT: @Xaryu i need 1000g donation and i can reveal the truth about the boss
[6:33:57] ScryerTV: Kite him to stormwind keep? Maybe guards/boss do a lot of dmg
[6:33:59] voidtouched_93: @Vernion enchant is unsustainable in ssf, need a BS for rods.
[6:34:00] ybrouillard: @xaryu Bruise is useless, under 20% everyone does way more
[6:34:00] osopolar1977: this game is all about secrets now
[6:34:00] DanRas08: Maybe it's not the amoutn of bruised but just to have it
[6:34:05] AceOfFlame: mine got 2x with 7 bruises when got into arena
[6:34:05] stroobzbeats: SEASON OF DISCOVERY
[6:34:07] iamharmor: it does not @MindWaveGG
[6:34:09] Honeycrispie: Why are people acting like blizzard didnt specifically post about what bruised does LUL
[6:34:09] foresterny: @xenev idk buddy 2k mutilates are not normal
[6:34:10] perturb25: @Xaryu just tank the boss on the alter and everyone spam aoe the boss and everyone down while turning in coins insta
[6:34:11] MrMowf: @xaryu there is zero confirmed indication that Bruised gives dmg buff.  "bruised" is an old DnD effect that increases "bleeding" or "bludgeon"  only thing i can confirm it effects is the amount of blood you drop/lose/give other players when you die.   DO NOT AMP DMG
[6:34:12] WildeThornberry: maybe bruised gives more blood
[6:34:13] am_egg: I'm not if bruised does anything, people said they had 10-20 stacks and did double also
[6:34:14] ttvnorbitaker: phase two damage
[6:34:16] daigurren2: I think hes saying that enrage weakens his def
[6:34:17] Skerelijer: I bet he'll drop a waylaid shipment - but it's full, as a reward for your effort!
[6:34:19] cookie_jayy: so much COPIUM
[6:34:19] koctopus: What if you deal more damage the lower your health is?
[6:34:20] Mico027: Why would they add "bruise" debuff if it does nothing
[6:34:22] HiddenChin: Bruyise may feed?
[6:34:22] Riji07: no its bruise
[6:34:23] fartybum: SSF HARDCORE?
[6:34:26] realandtruephobe: I don't know why, but I had 17 stacks of bruised and was doing nutty damage (400+ dps)
[6:34:26] RoonGaming: Has the bosses health grown to the same value each time at 20%?
[6:34:26] Xgeonmar: just need warriors to execute
[6:34:27] sushileafbeats: Could be more ears = more damage taken?
[6:34:27] TheHieroja: bruised does not increase dmg its the phase thong
[6:34:28] Andikun: what if we bring him to every altar??
[6:34:28] Xoq_twitch: Bonjour @Xaryu
[6:34:28] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: i think you just need to optimize uptime on the boss. like if you didn't have lag each time it would have died
[6:34:29] FrierenHC: he gainst health but takes more dmg
[6:34:30] ScryerTV: Kite to stormwind keep
[6:34:31] MyPetGooseLarry: How low did yall get him today? just got home
[6:34:32] detourz28: I think so because i hit 1.1k auto attacks in p2
[6:34:33] Cryof53: more blood turn ins = more dmg boss takes? have people turning in bloods the entire time while keeping 1?
[6:34:33] xenev: @foresterny But you can get bruised WAY before that point of the fight and you don't do more damage so idk
[6:34:36] D4KiR: the blood god must be bleeding
[6:34:37] walruscow: bruised needs to mean something. not only it's presence but also its stacks
[6:34:38] flucky90: I think the boss is switching to zerker stance phase 2 and taking 20% more damage
[6:34:39] covinwastaken: more ears he has more damage he takes?
[6:34:41] osopolar1977: Season Of Work
[6:34:42] myyrlidon: @Xaryu when you do this you get like 15,000 viewers its insan. grats on being the biggest wow streamer
[6:34:43] DogShitPaladin: Why do no groups have logs for this?
[6:34:44] waterbottle4511: @Xaryu kiting him to water to wash off the blood might make him take more dmg
[6:34:45] pliley: how much was he healing after the blood was turned in?
[6:34:47] Gabe4D: @xaryu 9% this last run
[6:34:47] deviangosu: I AM AT CAVE OF BENGAL! ANYONE GOT ANY IDEA XARYU??????
[6:34:48] GoldenKingGK: Great attempts!
[6:34:49] Turkeypitz: what‚Äôs max bruise stacks, I‚Äôve seen 5
[6:34:51] Vernion: @voidtouched_93 what do you mean by BS for rods?
[6:34:51] MouseBite10: @Xaryu you feed him blood and make him big and then burst him down
[6:34:52] ttvnorbitaker: I think Arena strat is the best
[6:34:52] JayrBayr: The bigger they are the harder they fall... Feed him blood then burn him down.
[6:34:53] migliqt: keep grinding
[6:34:53] bugcatcher19: there was ppl without bloods on purpose

[6:35:07] Allomaternal: does dying on the altar itself do anything?
[6:35:07] JackDiesel_: @Xaryu who was the polar guy that was griefing
[6:35:10] TheDeavs: Can you buy anything different during phase 2?
[6:35:10] Nebulas2: it could be just to show how many times you died to boss

[6:35:31] tuna_sandw1ch: @Xaryu you have to sacrifice payo on the alter
[6:35:32] iExco: of course, its not supposed to be this hard
[6:35:32] Ophelly: Idea: your damage is only increased if you turn blood with the bruise debuff - reset on death
[6:35:34] hmeag: Xar look up "to kill a Loa" quest on wowhead. It has clues!

[6:35:44] walruscow: is there lore in the game that gives clues?
[6:35:44] Nebulas2: maybe we need to take him to ZG
[6:35:46] naturalduck: I think it's just lag/dc's making him unkillable, otherwise he already is
[6:35:46] im__peanut: SOMETHING IS SOMETHING FOR SURE ITS SOMETHING
[6:35:48] NalxTV: they rlly should nerf him cuze an average player cant get a grp of 40 and make them get bruised stacks.

[6:35:55] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu i mean its gotta be doable, why else would GMs show up TWO TIMES, giving hints, and tanking the boss?

[6:35:58] Kitooed: At one point you said you do 2000 damage with arcane blast, do you remember how many stacks u had? I think 1 stack is 100% more damage below 20%?
[6:35:59] Andikun: yeah we definitely dont brute force it, bring him to every altar
[6:35:59] idiotferaltko: ITS A LVL 60 BOSS...ONLY TAKE 20 PPL AT 60

[6:39:04] youngkarlitos: Once selected, the food is placed on special calabashes known as assiettes de Guin√©e which are located on the altar.[57]
[6:39:05] JayrBayr: Make him big first seems like you all did more damage when he got big and you haven't tired to make him big before 20% only after
[6:39:07] deviangosu: @Xaryu BRO I AM AT CAVE OF BENGAL! CANT SEe the vendor and i am getting DC every 5 minutes!! MAKE PEOPLE KNOW!! something is HERE!!!!
[6:39:07] Refoken: Spam die at an altar?
[6:39:08] CallmePadre7: CallmePadre7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Oh. Hi. Did you put Detect Magic on him?
[6:39:08] xenogod1: what if being in a raid group and dieing with the raid debuff actually applies a debuff to his damage as well?
[6:39:09] osopolar1977: take him to tiger rares
[6:39:09] jettmknz: kite him to the cave where the bengal tiger was originally found
[6:39:09] jmenujusemisko: draaaaag him to sw
[6:39:09] meazey3: LOGIN
[6:39:10] Thiccnuggie: i did like the idea about bringing him to ZG altar or like the blood island
[6:39:10] jakeo92: Bruises is a debuff to help smaller raids complete it in the future, since they die more often stacking bruise faster so that a smaller group can do more dmg
[6:39:11] coozy: @xaryu drag him to booty bay and get the guards to help
[6:39:12] Copertone: SSF Pog
[6:39:12] rohmantv: self found hard core? or
[6:39:12] RoonGaming: Is his p2 health always the same?
[6:39:13] jabaitedpagle: LOA backwards is AOL, everyone log on through AOL to kill him
[6:39:13] regis_philbin_: i do think it has to be some kind of death mechanic where dying a lot is the answer, be it bruised or some other weiird interactioin
[6:39:14] MrMowf: @xaryu you can take him into water, i have screen shots of him swimming across the lake to kill me .
[6:39:15] kis87: or Murky Depths Lake, is Azeroth's second largest lake found just west of Zul'Gurub in Northern Stranglethorn. A far cry from the pleasant waters of Lake Everstill, this lake is thick with slime and insects, and a swimmer will learn much of the pain if she sticks in a toe.
[6:39:15] TheDeavs: Drag to BB and feed him guards above lvl 40
[6:39:15] thedelmont: are they going to try again at 6????
[6:39:16] lumi929: fewer is more xarW
[6:39:17] soyx: YES SSF OUT

[6:39:18] MrStLouis68: @Xaryu looking forward to seeing you kill the boss in p3
[6:39:20] AsArAd789: Did they kill Kha'damu?
[6:39:22] MilanJebac96: with all due respect but whenever I'm reading the WoW forum posts I feel like those people only have a copper wire in their head who's only purpose is to hold their ears together @Xaryu
[6:39:22] youngkarlitos: @Xaryu this is on the wiki "Once selected, the food is placed on special calabashes known as assiettes de Guin√©e which are located on the altar.[57]" under the section about the  ritual
[6:39:23] TransMutedMaya: XARYU ARMY, TIME TO DDOS SSF HC
[6:39:24] indistinct: @coozy guards are asleep during event
[6:39:27] Whip_xo: @Xaryu Loa is about blood sacrifice. Feeding the god makes sense. Sacrifice has to be the key
[6:39:29] RebornOG: @deviangosu screenshot or lies
[6:39:29] taylorsdank: was at 25k
[6:39:29] kis87: drag him into the lake

[6:39:35] waterbottle4511: @Xaryu Has anyone tried knleeling to blood loa at altar?
[6:39:35] lofibanshee: Have you tried just killing him?
[6:39:36] drusankeb: @Xaryu rate SoD 1-10 so far
[6:39:37] thedelmont: are they going to try again at 6???
[6:39:39] jackymoon: did they kill the bloodmoon
[6:39:39] jandoodle2: Feeding the boss gives him more hp but he takes more damage feed the blood clat and smack him around

[6:40:09] Azulion: I honestly believe devs want to see him die this phase. It's just tightly tuned (whether they meant to or not). If it doesn't die in a week I can see health get nerfed
