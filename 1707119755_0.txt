[0:55:27] Aervyper: @Towelliee but it's like everything else. People gonna degenerate good parts and then they gonna nerf it and no one is going to do it
[0:55:42] Rudric_Ice: too many PVE andies
[0:55:57] Sarocus: Protip: When in a combat zone, dont wander around alone.
[0:56:00] Rudric_Ice: they like to fight AI
[0:56:10] MikeyGy: so previous structue with pvp servers
[0:56:18] Aervyper: @Towelliee add to that gear was stagnent and the same... then i might agree
[0:56:36] Sollice: I still don't get the idea of shitting on an idea you have no intention of doing. If you don't like warmode great dont turn it on...if you do then these are great ideas
[0:56:37] Toonces_TheDrivingCat: weren't there pvp servers in the past?
[0:56:44] flebbooo: That could actually work
[0:57:10] Thoreya: BFA had the best warmode
[0:57:12] Thoreya: sadge
[0:57:16] Thoreya: shit was perfect
[0:57:17] PigPenLen: pvp'ers want to switch servers to PVE?
[0:57:44] geokouts: make 2 or 3 servers ineach region pvp
[0:58:05] fewyn: i'm just bad yes
[0:58:14] Aervyper: @Towelliee lets talk to AV currently about the not bitching lol
[0:58:19] dracullus: lets call it battleground
[0:58:35] mavericks312: idk man i just dont think the WoW team doesnt take there pvp serious anymore
[0:58:36] propoopimus: make it like warhammer age of reckoning, where you can take keeps and eventually the city and shit
[0:58:39] DangerZoneJunky: So…epic bgs?
[0:59:11] fewyn: i started warmode earlier this week because to fix WQs and the more nodes and some extra rewards is kind of nice
[0:59:12] Thoreya: @mavericks312 the devs pvp all the time, they always say they pvp. prob just dont know the ifx
[0:59:16] Thoreya: fix*
[0:59:27] fewyn: but getting randomly one shot is not fun
[0:59:46] Aervyper: @Towelliee i want to PVP and get world quest rewards but getting one shot by a monk makes you never want to even look at it
[0:59:49] NotEnoughMana: happiest day of their lives LUL
[1:00:07] PvtHudson093: WM was only good as Alliance when farming AP in BFA
[1:00:12] geokouts: simple if you dont like PvP DONT turn WM on
[1:00:25] SpidercowSD: I mean thats war mode
[1:00:34] Thoreya: bfa did it perfect
[1:00:46] Quojin: ppl mostly use warmode for the lvling bonus
[1:01:08] Thoreya: the invasions strictly for warmode, bonuses etc
[1:01:12] Aervyper: @Towelliee the problem with PVP is there is a Winner and a LOSER  (no one wants to lose ever)
[1:01:14] Full_theone: I really miss the Legion pvp zones/wq's
[1:01:20] Thoreya: crates
[1:01:22] dracullus: I do 1 every day and always people are fighting
[1:01:34] Herzenliegen: very rare
[1:01:52] Lilurrn: that is rare but I think thats blizzard vision lol
[1:02:03] Bayendetto: I play super casually. I maybe jump on for a handful of hours a week. I don’t want to spend my limited time in world pvp when I just want to do some world quests
[1:02:12] BobLongMVP: waking shore is poppin this morning. ppl are everywhere
[1:02:14] Thoreya: remember the kill to arms quest in bfa <3
[1:02:16] Thoreya: good times
[1:02:25] Full_theone: @Bayendetto good thing its completely optional
[1:02:35] Nasilvera: soon as you go to a pvp world quest you get zerged even by your own faction.
[1:02:58] Aervyper: honestly if you want PVP like that play Dark and Darker
[1:03:04] Lilurrn: @Nasilvera lol yeah
[1:03:19] mavericks312: and lets be honest here pvpers are only at max 8% of the community
[1:03:29] Dcarter: for the record the bulls do follow thru the portal iin HoV
[1:03:44] Aervyper: @mavericks312 what's mythic raiders 2%?
[1:03:47] Thoreya: with solo shuffle its def higher than 8% lol
[1:04:04] Thoreya: think pvers dont respect pvp much bc they dont play it
[1:04:26] Thoreya: but the devs def do, morgan was saying how much they pvp lol
[1:04:33] mavericks312: @Aervyper no there about 8-10% mythic raiders
[1:05:16] Rudric_Ice: @Thoreya it goes both ways actually
[1:05:22] Aervyper: @mavericks312 then if that's the case your right blizz should put as much money into Mythic raiding as pvp
[1:06:12] Lilurrn: but I do like cross faction dungeons and raids
[1:06:19] Rudric_Ice: we didnt get a single new bg in prolly a decade
[1:06:24] Sybexia: Sybexia subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[1:06:26] mavericks312: @Aervyper well yes and no, casuals are not anywhere close to mythic raiding and there the majority of the community at this point

[2:42:45] freakyyytv: Derrick Carr was a good quarterback in a bad system
[2:42:54] mavericks312: why would the bears trade out of number 1 and will anderson
[2:42:55] Spiffypal: do i return to this game? hmmmm

[2:44:04] ca8l: you can be a coach in Indianapolis if you want
[2:44:05] ryanc1124: Baker would be dumb to leave McVay

[2:44:11] protocols_: protocols_ subscribed at Tier 1.

[2:44:19] pepesmokez: give justin fields a chance with some better weapons/line pieces dude is electric to watch sometimes

[2:45:04] protocols_: I just came back havent played since WoD
[2:45:05] xALcaPWNedx: Brady to the Dolphins, Rodgers stays a Packer, Carr to the colts, JImmy G to the Jets, Raiders get NOTHING
[2:45:16] Redbearded16: thats my dad
[2:45:30] Keglett: the ret downplay is ridiculous
[2:45:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: They just  buffed ret

[2:45:34] peterdragon18: broken lol

[2:46:01] Malarick: agreed.  I feel very squishy as a Ret
[2:46:01] xALcaPWNedx: I think there is a small chance Rodgers stays and I think he will retire a packer
[2:46:13] Sollice: Why would Rogers want to go to the Raiders
[2:46:13] pepesmokez: @xALcaPWNedx feel like jimmy g would rather stay on west coast area with raiders
[2:46:22] xALcaPWNedx: Rodgers cannot be released until June..Not sure if the Raiders are that patient
[2:46:25] Azg0th: @Shrenko What survivability changes are coming?
[2:46:29] nephttv_: naowh did a 20 NO as a 207 warrior
[2:46:43] mavericks312: the raiders have actual weapons
[2:46:48] pepesmokez: @Neph__98 WTF
[2:46:50] Thoreya: Random healer
[2:46:54] Thoreya: Pugs
[2:46:55] nephttv_: def wasnt a pug lmao
[2:47:01] Shrenko: @Azg0th huh?
[2:47:16] ColzenX: Most Mock draft show Stroud going 4th to Colts
[2:47:16] Thoreya: It was a pug lol. Posted in lfg
[2:47:17] MattMancer: @Neph__98 you...you mean 307 right
[2:47:22] xhale2nhale: doubt it was ur regular average Joe
[2:47:24] Thoreya: Was on the stream
[2:47:25] mostwanted808: 207?
[2:47:26] nephttv_: kidding , it was some random ass pug
[2:47:31] Ken_54: what's the name of the addon that auto marks adds?
[2:47:34] PvtHudson093: i need my catalyst
[2:47:39] Sollice: I dunno @mavericks312 aside from Adams
[2:47:43] SavageCheez: What if Brady does go to the Dolphins....and Rodgers gets picked up by the Bucs =D
[2:47:47] nephttv_: @Towelliee Check discord dms, sent the pic
[2:48:03] Sollice: Yeah @Bertandbum did
[2:48:17] Sweet_Lou__: I am hella excited over Trading Post, but honestly, I cannot WAIT for mage tower to be always open
[2:48:24] Sollice: Why would Brady go to the Dolphins....
[2:48:24] mavericks312: @Sollice waller,jacobs,renfroe
[2:48:30] Sweet_Lou__: that update cant get here soon enough
[2:48:31] Sollice: Unless Tua is done done

[2:48:53] Jarlan23: cupcake shield
[2:49:03] SavageCheez: Tua probably will be asked to think about his future
[2:49:09] LoseAlotLuke: using my microwave dish as a shield
[2:49:36] cynical_effect12: Sam Howell will be the QB for the Commanders next season
[2:49:50] Sollice: I am sure Tua has already been asked, but not by the Dolphins. Why would they want him to quit the game to get Brady who MAYBE gives them a year
[2:50:02] SavageCheez: Howell is a good QB
[2:50:05] chessboxin34: hes actually the best qb on the team
[2:50:26] MMO_mADman: GO TITANS!! PLEEEASE let the Colts pickup Derek Carr. PLEEEASE. Also Buckner aint good enough to just give up for the 1st overall pick. He is overrated AF (been waiting 10 mins to send this)
[2:50:45] bigstick258: once people have tape on purdy he will be third string
[2:50:47] danoh_64: lmao sell them brocks
[2:50:56] nephttv_: @Towelliee https://imgur.com/a/OgNuFp5 and chat if your curious
[2:51:00] MMO_mADman: Titans gonna trade for DHop
[2:51:00] protocols_: I'm a huge giants fan. Honestly im impressed with Daniel Jones this year especially working with no WR core. i think we may be able to go into minnesota and do something but after that were done. im hoping to get a big trade or something this offseason
[2:51:12] mavericks312: @MMO_mADman your qb is ryan tannehill sit down please
[2:51:14] SavageCheez: I bet Brady hangs around another 3 years
[2:51:34] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 Yea, and he beat the Colts twice this year
[2:51:35] chessboxin34: third string behind who? garbage trey lance? and jimmy g who wont be there? lol
[2:51:43] bigstick258: mn is like 40 points from not winning a game this yuear lol
[2:51:45] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 and last year
[2:51:46] danoh_64: lol thats amazing i just bought a verlander rookie for 4 bucks
[2:51:50] ViperLSS: What do I do to get the next level of gear past 270?
[2:51:54] maccaruso: People looooooove speculation buying
[2:51:57] mavericks312: @MMO_mADman and are sitting on the couch after losing 7 in a row
[2:52:03] RudeMood: it was the same thing in TCG's, if you followed the meta and the hype you could flip cards all day for easy money

[2:52:21] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 and set the league record again for injuries. What about it?
[2:52:21] protocols_: @Towelliee

[2:52:22] BriggsTx: pitchers dont selll anyway
[2:52:27] danoh_64: yea but def a hofer
[2:52:31] Phil87z: I wonder what a brick purdy card would go for
[2:52:39] mavericks312: @MMO_mADman next man up
[2:52:46] pepesmokez: tsunami boss/trash
[2:52:47] t_train_va: The rest of the group

[2:53:19] Krimsonz23: The fear with bloodcurdling shout

[2:55:23] mavericks312: i mean ppl pay 300k for a fuckin charizard so ppl will pay for anything

[2:55:57] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 I got nothin against the Falcons
[2:56:06] mavericks312: @MMO_mADman and you can have his ass back lol
[2:56:16] Plateau: sweet thank you Towel
[2:56:29] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 HAHA!
[2:56:54] mavericks312: @Cleavinseagal maybe maybe not, if they let jimmy g walk he is 100% day 1 starter next year
[2:57:07] chessboxin34: purdy isnt the hard thing to stop on the 9ers, it's the supporting cast thats nuts
[2:57:13] chessboxin34: has nothing to do with tape on purdy

[2:57:16] mavericks312: @MMO_mADman i lost all respect for him when he waited 13 weeks to bench mariotta

[2:58:00] bigstick258: i am not saying he wont be the starter I am just saying he has no tape so we will see once they do
[2:58:10] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 yea, we ruined Mariota, he hasnt been the same since his ulnar nerve injury
[2:58:14] MeisterPetze: good old days
[2:58:35] Razznab: still hard af for a mage to solo
[2:59:02] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 his first game he threw 5 Touchdowns and was just OWNING the Bucs and we all thought we had a 15 year starter
[2:59:04] mavericks312: @MMO_mADman it would have been fine if he started ridder by week 10 to give us more of a sample size to see if he is the qb of the future
[2:59:32] bigstick258: sf should keep jimmy g tbh and then bring along either of the other two they think is his replacement
[2:59:36] thiccsushi: not good offensive PogChamp
[2:59:49] bigstick258: i dont know what jimmy g contract is; when its up
[2:59:50] Sollice: 250k on No
[2:59:52] Molvonos: Maaaan.
[2:59:55] cptrogers123: Nope KEKW
[3:00:01] MMO_mADman: @mavericks312 Ridder is more like an Alex Smith than a Dak. His player comp actually is Ryan Tannehiill
[3:00:09] thiccsushi: I'm going all in on believing
[3:00:18] t_train_va: Why are so many people ignorant of the situation with Jimmy G? He's a no strings attached free agent
[3:00:23] Molvonos: Lock, DH< Shaman?
[3:00:25] Molvonos: Hmmm
[3:00:28] mavericks312: @Cleavinseagal i dont see them giving jimmy g a 25-30mil a year contract though if they think lance is the future
