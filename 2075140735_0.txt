[1:22:10] monkeylol__: ye if u freedom and run over the roots they dont spawn
[1:22:29] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy

[3:11:17] nastye: @vaerexa mage is receiving a boost for sure
[3:11:18] CrownofLust: mm most of the time its because of frustration i guess, when they get off from a bad key people often tries to fill themselves like it, im just not good enough so i dont flame :v at least not too often
[3:11:34] vaerexa: @nastye lmao is that u
[3:11:40] nastye: @vaerexa yea LUL

[3:16:11] Cinderrzz: Did you clear the key
[3:16:12] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: its like an actual pet peeve
[3:16:41] Klutch_GD: nope unfortunatly
[3:16:44] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: this is prob one of the worser bosses
[3:16:46] CrownofLust: @CarefulWithThatAxeEugene yes i dont understand how it works but i thinks its if they use a dog they can kick and if they do not use a dog they cant ? something like that ?
[3:16:55] Cinderrzz: Ahh darn
[3:17:02] Klutch_GD: @CarefulWithThatAxeEugene morchie is more annoying in my eyes
[3:17:12] vaerexa: this boss is just insane to  heal
[3:17:25] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: @CrownofLust nah we get an interupt with our felguard it also is a single target stun, then we got deathcoil / our shadow fury
[3:17:29] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[3:17:57] CrownofLust: @CarefulWithThatAxeEugene oh so actually thats a lot of interrutps damn

[3:18:19] CarefulWithThatAxeEugene: @CrownofLust yea but most just choose to simply dps only hah
[3:18:32] vaerexa: ya took me like two weeks to get a decent feel of how to heal this on my prevoker
[3:18:45] Akyran: always focus the adds
[3:18:48] bsg_wiz: whats ur opinion of the pve content so far
[3:19:19] Akyran: ahw
[3:19:28] Badziee: sad
[3:19:36] Klutch_GD: raiding is better than M+, M+ hurts my head most of the time especially as a tank
[3:19:51] Akyran: @Klutch_GD XD you can sleep on the keyboard in raid as a tank
[3:20:10] Akyran: but i guess the first few times the fights can be fun yeah
[3:20:13] Klutch_GD: im a dk tank so raiding treats me better...
[3:20:13] Cinderrzz: I think today is rhe day I take my fore mage into mythic keys and see what this is all about
[3:20:14] vaerexa: cant wait to see my baby DK vault
[3:20:18] bsg_wiz: raiding is fun IMO but also very stressful and not always even close to worthwhile
[3:20:21] CrownofLust: @Klutch_GD i like m+ best because its been hard to find 20 people thats always ready for raids :c at least on my server
[3:20:34] Akyran: m+ its sad when you are not meta class tho yeah, always having to play own key etc.
[3:20:47] CrownofLust: i was thinking on swapping from ragnaros to other server but i dont know if that will be good too
[3:20:51] Badziee: I haven't done any keys this season. watching here to learn boss tactics :)
[3:20:52] Akyran: i hope they ll balance the tanks even better next ssn, but even now you can ez do +25 on any tank
[3:20:54] Klutch_GD: thankfully i got guild raiding
[3:21:08] Klutch_GD: @Akyran exactly im a dk so it SUCKS
[3:21:12] albin_real: Welcome home to Sweden GlitchCat
[3:21:16] vaerexa: @CrownofLust what server would you transfer to
[3:21:18] bsg_wiz: @Klutch_GD wym by that?
[3:21:30] bsg_wiz: @Klutch_GD do u feel DK are bad at M+?
[3:21:35] vaerexa: DK if off meta
[3:21:57] bsg_wiz: meta only matters for keys way beyond the cutoff for getting geared.
[3:22:04] Klutch_GD: @bsg_wiz dk's have a HARD time taking damage we have lots of health and TONS of heals to compensate but when your doing +23 and higher things will just one shot you no exception
[3:22:29] StreamElements: https://starforgepc.com/Snowmixy
[3:22:34] Klutch_GD: but of course any tank can do +20 key im just complaining about further
[3:22:35] CrownofLust: @vaerexa i dont know actually because i have 12 characters but only maining like 3 of them and the 3 of them are in ragnaros i use dk dh and priest
[3:22:35] vaerexa: You just gotta plan every cd so that doesnt happen, and make sure you pull with bone shield up
[3:22:50] bsg_wiz: @Klutch_GD honestly tho, what is even the point of 23+?
[3:22:59] StreamElements: My current playlist is: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yfpG2DjHPthKZwAbD8tYE
[3:23:00] bsg_wiz: oh blood, yeah
[3:23:07] bsg_wiz: i wasnt sure if u meant tanking or dps
[3:23:21] Klutch_GD: @bsg_wiz a challenge, i stopped a long time ago tho because of that i typically only do +19 and +20
[3:24:21] Klutch_GD: ayy my server is back up
[3:25:41] rammygoat: rammygoat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! snowmiAkito
