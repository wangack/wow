[1:14:39] byrdmojo: it's inevitable I feel like
[1:14:40] Arthident: i never liked them and never attended one as well
[1:14:42] zetterbeard1: horrible for the game

[1:14:43] mlady_telegramz97: YEP
[1:14:48] viclund1: gdkp's would be fine but wow players are cringe and buy gold so they don't work YEP
[1:14:48] Kazay1998: GDKP's is so bad. It ruins the economy in the game
[1:14:48] gorfang: Staysafe Right wing based chad
[1:14:50] Dritzzts: like audience?
[1:14:51] TheWhiteRabbitxX: it‚Äôs a bad thing for the game. why not just eliminate all bad things?
[1:14:55] Kleik__: idk i enjoy running gdkp when im geared to make gold
[1:14:58] JockeGorans: ofcourse it should be against tos. literally destroys the game
[1:14:59] Dogarian: I don‚Äôt mind em cuz I hate 10 man guild raids
[1:14:59] chr47: GDKP without gold-buying is fine, but it is one of the biggest RMT driving things
[1:14:59] valeforia: gdkps are just about who bought more gold.
[1:15:00] Hellacat: will never be banned. its a great loot system
[1:15:02] Seline88: GDKPs are great for healing classes that can't farm solo
[1:15:03] sickish: if they banned more bots and gold buyers, gdkp would be fine
[1:15:04] victorinox1609: guzu you would make a great politician with those neutral takes KEKW
[1:15:04] Slappetrask: Ban it for sure
[1:15:06] raiwist: i say send them to prison and make them do years of hard labour YEP
[1:15:07] HorizonFX: It honestly doesn't matter because the WoW Token exists.
[1:15:08] aggr0crag32: @gorfang Denthey
[1:15:13] nobody_knows_best: pay to win raid NotLikeThis the worst
[1:15:14] Trexbo_: Oh but we shouldn't care about Multiboxers? Stare
[1:15:15] jazzyjoff: GDKP = server inflation + pay to win
[1:15:16] geennaamnl1: GDKP's in indirect the result of items usually being 10 gold are now 100gold
[1:15:24] Nazura0: YEP
[1:15:24] Niksen_99: Lets be real GDKP is not the problem. Bots ruining the game
[1:15:25] LeeshDK: @victorinox1609 yeah i was in there once and viewers were unironically saying they would prefer a "benevolent" dictator to an elected official they don't like. KEKW big nope.
[1:15:27] gorfang: Gdkp is nice when you're bis
[1:15:27] mrbluesky1337: gdkps suck so hard when njo epic drop why even talk about this shiet lmao
[1:15:29] justeaton: YEP
[1:15:29] Parshce: GDKPs are only part of the gold buying problem, gold buyers will still use it for consumes etc
[1:15:30] 21bender21: Gdkps kill a lot of the social. Who needs a guild if u can gdkp ur gear
[1:15:35] mlady_telegramz97: but multiboxing is fine huh? Stare
[1:15:36] mirageracewayqt: GDKP is a nice loot system, in SR runs u can just pay gold for consumes and dont get loot , in gdkp if u get no loot u get gold , u always get something out of each run @Guzu
[1:15:37] Arthident: 3
[1:15:38] Geartrix: people OPENLY buy gold thats the crazy part
[1:15:45] crag_h: it's pay2win
[1:15:45] TheWhiteRabbitxX: gamers these days don‚Äôt know how to do gaming .. lol. would have never lasted during the real games
[1:15:54] Dhooggo: is just a form to play the game the problem is to buy gold with real money
[1:15:55] brakealot: why does staysafe always look angry tho
[1:15:57] OlympicUSA: Just roll to 100 against people it‚Äôs funner
[1:15:59] raiwist: GDKP targets the body's white blood cells, weakening the immune system.
[1:16:00] Hellacat: I prefer pickup gdkps over scheduled guild runs. less drama
[1:16:10] doctorsupra: ruining the game is such a dumb statement. people who play 12hrs a day saying that is just cringe
[1:16:13] Ebsoni: Dabuvix was the chosen one to stop all bots and gold selling... Too bad he died
[1:16:15] JockeGorans: GDKPs is the reason we have so much bots
[1:16:15] sicknope: Such a one minded comment lol
[1:16:15] TrueNosus: they just need stricter punishment for gold buyers @Guzu
[1:16:16] Bambambm: GDKP's are 100% being used by people who want gold but don't want to buy gold by just receiving gold by someone who DID buy it.
[1:16:17] viclund1: @brakealot There is nothing to be happy about when you're a wow creator Aware
[1:16:17] SirHeiska: Yeah... But AH does same as gdkp
[1:16:19] gorfang: Everyone report badtank forthat comment
[1:16:20] vaultec_: @brakealot miserable person probably YEP
[1:16:20] Assertonsin: wtf, what's wrong with gdkps?
[1:16:28] fr03doc: what happens when all the tanks and healer are fully geared and don‚Äôt want to raid? it encourages them to keep raiding?
[1:16:29] edene_1: how you can ban that thats stupid
[1:16:32] coconutenjoyer: ban gold
[1:16:37] Hellacat: ban gold
[1:16:41] nobody_knows_best: @Assertonsin anything
[1:16:42] geennaamnl1: GDKP's are the problem , swipers do GDKP's. If there were no swipers GDKP's would be awsome but since there are swipers GDKP's should be banned. The inflation is already so BIG on the SoD servers...
[1:16:42] TheWhiteRabbitxX: that‚Äôs greed. can‚Äôt be a part of a team‚Ä¶ needs something because they‚Äôre a baby back bitch
[1:16:45] jazzyjoff: Well the root of the problems are the bots right?
[1:16:46] raiwist: GDKPs have the ability to suck a person's soul out through their mouths, and they drain feelings of happiness and joy; employed as the guards of the wizard prison Azkaban; can only be repelled by the Patronus Charm.
[1:16:48] brakealot: ban denmark
[1:16:49] sb300: i dont see many gdkps in sod maybe in us its more
[1:16:49] Kazay1998: @Assertonsin Sadly makes people buy gold = ruining the economy of the game for everyone else
[1:16:50] crag_h: GDKPs encourage players to buy gold from gold-sellers
[1:16:55] gorfang: Make everything free!!! No more gold in wow
[1:16:57] Slappetrask: Gdkp's are only for hardcore andies like prefox that take a group of 20 friends and suck gold from noobs.
[1:17:00] TLBacon: GDKP's are like chocolate chip cookies and milk
[1:17:00] mlady_telegramz97: if you ban bots and goldbuyers, the GDKP problem also gets a bit better too
[1:17:01] nmapst: start perma ban for gold buying to scare the majority against it
[1:17:06] PGsolutionAB: blizzard make money of bots to so its never gonna end
[1:17:09] nicyoda12: dude the static in the mic & you look out of sync to....
[1:17:09] mordiell: @nmapst this
[1:17:12] Niksen_99: Has anyone tried a soft reserve run? Its so bad
[1:17:18] supersegue: I wish gdkp were only done by people who need gold
[1:17:18] 420orgasmdonator: i love GDKP but i dont buy gold
[1:17:22] notyourartist: I feel like everything I log in now I get a mail from blizzard for reporting bots
[1:17:23] FlowersAnger: The game in general encourages people to do that anyways
[1:17:29] mlady_telegramz97: om om
[1:17:29] BALtaram: GDKP in itself isn't a bad system, but RMT ruins it
[1:17:32] mlady_telegramz97: here we go
[1:17:32] itsugba: SR is the goat
[1:17:32] Trexbo_: SR are bad? HUH
[1:17:32] Syloa: whats wrong with sr om
[1:17:33] notyourartist: Everytime*
[1:17:33] mlady_telegramz97: om om
[1:17:33] Bambambm: Soft reserve runs are the BEST tbh
[1:17:35] 420orgasmdonator: i hate SR runs
[1:17:35] TrueNosus: i like SR
[1:17:40] sohnvomvadda: Streamer soft reserve tho hehe
[1:17:41] TheWhiteRabbitxX: nothing else in the game requires even close to that amount of gold. that‚Äôs absurd
[1:17:41] LeeshDK: what is soft reserve?
[1:17:44] vaultec_: show us your shadowmourne then Smile
[1:17:46] mordiell: i wouldnt even bother with bots, just ban people for buying gold and no one will buy it anymore, so no need for bots and gold sellers
[1:17:46] SeusV: i only run SR
[1:17:47] Syloa: ok enlighten us, chatter
[1:17:50] Nazura0: SR feels more at home savixComfy
[1:17:51] 420orgasmdonator: yes
[1:17:52] Trexbo_: Is Soft Reserve bad? HUH
[1:17:52] BiggieBoyZ: if u just need a few items SR is really good
[1:17:53] Petrichorx_x: SR is fine
[1:17:56] mirageracewayqt: hate SR runs and MS>OS , cos i always roll like shit
[1:17:57] havingagreattime: i only did SR
[1:18:00] Kazay1998: SR is a good way to do stuff
[1:18:02] Ticklezao: that comment tho
[1:18:03] toyye123: well you can just see that gdkps are doing 12/12 hc icc and most pugs are doing like 7-8/12 hc
[1:18:06] mlady_telegramz97: soft reserve is fine tho
[1:18:07] crag_h: I like MS>OS
[1:18:11] sicknope: Ive heard alot of streamer's "getting gold" from others, like shobek. he got 600+ gold from people who bought it for him most likely.
[1:18:11] OlympicUSA: SR is really good if you only need 2 items left. SR is bad if you are a freshie
[1:18:15] PGsolutionAB: make a token then
[1:18:16] geennaamnl1: When I try to farm something it almost feels worthless and everytime I think ''why should I farm something when I can buy it with less effort''. I haven't bought any gold but im deff on the edge.
[1:18:21] mlady_telegramz97: although i like MS> OS more
[1:18:24] Bambambm: Ban people receiving gold from gold buyers and GDKPs will be gone overnight
[1:18:24] chr47: Majority?????
[1:18:30] Geartrix: soft res is a late patch system
[1:18:32] capisun523: I think GDKP is  ok but I do think blizzard should ban if u buy gold
[1:18:34] Kazay1998: @Nunadaaa btw, is it LOTR next sunday as well?
[1:18:34] sercookiebandit: people do absolute dog crap in Sr runs, people behave when gold is on the line
[1:18:34] viclund1: Buy gold omE
[1:18:37] bletso: Hmm
[1:18:38] TheWhiteRabbitxX: they should have banned soda. when they didn‚Äôt they all but endorsed gold buying
[1:18:38] gorfang: I buy gold no cap
[1:18:43] Nunadaaa: @Kazay1998 YEP
[1:18:45] fetza108: you cant reach this topic anymore?
[1:18:47] fetza108: i cant
[1:18:51] viclund1: just do dailies for gold guzu Clueless
[1:18:52] Synthez542: What your opinion on people that trade gold? (Yes may be trading with people that buy/bots as well)
[1:18:52] Hellacat: @TheWhiteRabbitxX thats what i learned from that experience.
[1:18:52] TrueNosus: i got into a SR raid on a new alt on SoD and everyone already had all their gear so i got all the shit
[1:18:54] Kazay1998: @Nunadaaa lovely
[1:18:55] geennaamnl1: GDKP's promote buying gold , simple as that.
[1:18:55] OlympicUSA: You join a pug and roll to 100 as the game intended.
[1:18:56] crag_h: I would like SR if you could res 2 items
[1:18:56] Alakablam: Alakablam subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! 57 years later and we're still on about this. Easy but also a terrible fix, personal loot, job done
[1:18:56] StreamElements: Alakablam just subscribed for 57 months in a row PogChamp
[1:18:58] raiwist: GDKP attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, Lily and James Potter, and leaves Harry with a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt.
[1:18:59] fetza108: this post is deleted?
[1:19:02] Nunadaaa: two towers next sunday around same time, 7 to 8pm
[1:19:03] mirageracewayqt: GDKPS are not the problem , bots are, saying and/or reporting gdkps is just pepedent, its like shooting someone because someone else stole something
[1:19:04] Alakablam: HUGGIES all
[1:19:05] sortatrolling: let's not lie to ourselves either. GDKP organizers are also the biggest gold sellers.
[1:19:07] Niksen_99: Idk not a fan of rolling vs 20 other warriors in naxx40
[1:19:08] mordiell: im gonna keep it real, players seeing streamers get bennies and lots of gold traded, helps to normalize that sort of gameplay
[1:19:09] Nunadaaa: @Alakablam hugg
[1:19:09] viclund1: KEKW
[1:19:15] Foodlebar: hugg Alakablam
[1:19:22] flowerpew: @mordiell true, fricc streamers
[1:19:22] Geartrix: if thers no gdkps theres still guilds selling slots when they are clearing with 9 man
[1:19:25] Muaytitus: Gdkp is ONLY reason to have tons of gold. Remove gdkp and no need to buy gold
[1:19:26] flowerpew: streamers fricc
[1:19:27] Ebsoni: Personal loot would fix 40man raids also
[1:19:27] mlady_telegramz97: @alakablam higg
[1:19:27] TrueNosus: no personal loot doesnt belong in classic imo
[1:19:28] Hellacat: Blizz publicly endorsed gold buying when they slapped soda's wrist
[1:19:29] crag_h: what do you think about loot council?
[1:19:30] fr03doc: u just lie to them and say ur budget is 200g when you have 50silver
[1:19:30] DemiG4: SR is kinda meh imo the better choise like in classic are Prio Runs and discuss who roll on what
[1:19:32] mlady_telegramz97: @alakablam hugg
[1:19:32] KlaupeZ: yea fricc personal loot
[1:19:33] Guzumerchmanager: the bad geared tank would have to do as everyone do, go 5 man groups and get items, instead of trying to speedrun every single char gearing 4Head
[1:19:33] nmapst: It is the fact that people arent scared of getting banned from gold buying, the amount of golds i have been in where people openly talk about buying gold, either i have memory lose or that wasnt a thing 10 years+  ago, people hid it more and was more ashamed. These days people talk openly about it and is proud of buying gold. We need to fix the mindset and the best way is to make wowhead post about perma banning 30k+ people for buying gold
[1:19:34] Nunadaaa: @flowerpew hiii and real
[1:19:38] Foodlebar: if personal loot didnt have the stupid trading restrictions it wouldnt be as bad
[1:19:38] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Of course, streamers encouraging viewers to give them shit encourages more people to buy gold so they can get more shit. That‚Äôs actually a thing.
[1:19:39] coconutenjoyer: Chatting
[1:19:40] theslothyone: I'm 5.4k GS on my resto sham and having big issues getting into !ANY! ICC raid because I don't have logs. Even ICC10N require pumper logs :(

[1:19:43] FlowersAnger: Personal loot is just ...... #notmyclassic REEEEEEEE
[1:19:44] nobody_knows_best: KEKW
[1:19:44] AmumuOG: SR is nice when everyone just needs a few pieces, and fresh characters get most other gear in those raids

[1:19:57] RayenFlores: true
[1:19:57] raiwist: GDKPs have the ability to suck a person's soul out through their mouths, and they drain feelings of happiness and joy; employed as the guards of the wizard prison Azkaban; can only be repelled by the Patronus Charm.
[1:19:57] Alakablam: HUGGIES @Foodlebar @Nunadaaa @mlady_telegramz97 @viclund1

[1:21:17] esbi__: bruhSit
[1:21:19] Alakablam: id love to see how many GDKP's would be left when the payout just covers repairs @Guzu
[1:21:25] DemiG4: we raidet with EPGP system for years even though its good you still face problems
[1:21:33] sohnvomvadda: BrainRot streamer = stupid -> topic = stupid

[1:23:29] br0fest0r: 60day ban, see you nxt phase
[1:23:29] Truthseeker96: ban all the streamers then LUL LBVS
[1:23:29] Syloa: delete the entire bnet account imo, not even kidding

[1:23:51] flowerpew: NODDERS tickle their feet
[1:23:53] Brefy123: people who buy gold shouldnt get banned but like reset all their gold or actualy delete all their characters
[1:24:01] DamDamPew: @flowerpew this
[1:24:01] sb300: the problem is thazt blizz is also banning peeps getting a big amount from friends!
[1:24:02] mlady_telegramz97: @flowerpew huh

[1:24:05] Foodlebar: if people didnt buy gold, there would be no need to run bots to farm gold
[1:24:05] Muaytitus: because gdkp exist!! Like wtf
[1:24:09] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Both are an infinite resource. They make money doing this they can just keep buying accounts Asmond Gold went over this by the time they realize it‚Äôs a bot. They‚Äôve made it way too much money.
[1:24:09] chr47: bots need like a few weeks to make their money back tbh
[1:24:10] Alakablam: and there are no sites to ban cause they all do it on discord, sooo where's discord enforcement Hmm
[1:24:10] flowerpew: Trexbo_ peepoEhm
[1:24:11] victorinox1609: permaing gold buyers would decimate classic wow streamers KEKW
[1:24:12] Nunadaaa: theyre doing a shit job at it tho imo, legit if they would have 1 GM per server you can single handedly already find so many bots and ban them
[1:24:16] pyrodave: you ban a bot, that same botter makes new bot in under 30 seconds, now you cant find it, by the time its found, its profitted, ban it again?
[1:24:19] Trexbo_: @flowerpew Stare
[1:24:19] raiwist: bzzz
[1:24:19] slappen_distel: Ban them and flag the accounts so people can see who has buyed gold
[1:24:22] crag_h: ye I think blizzard do ban bots, but the bots will just create new accounts
[1:24:27] Huertix: people buying gold are the same complaining most about bots
[1:24:27] sercookiebandit: if Rmt is against the ToS, then you do scaling bans for people buying gold
[1:24:33] viclund1: They should force the gold buyers to record a video where they apologize and upload it too youtube YEP
[1:24:36] Jack_kgbeast: Bots are real reason why LivingFlame locked? What do you think @Guzu
[1:24:37] Nunadaaa: like give me GM powers ill scout out SFK any sussy lvls youd ban hundreds in a day

[1:24:54] candie1031: every bot they ban there get replaced,too much money in gold farming
[1:24:55] Dutchlocked: I guess no advertising in chat
[1:24:56] Speyto: yea it doesnt work, cause people can do it natty too
[1:24:56] FlowersAnger: That's not implementable
[1:24:59] xNotorietyx: make it so you can't trade gold in a raid.
