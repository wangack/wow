[0:13:52] JustinFromFlorida: Its background static. Yeah Its extremely high pitched Ive been hearing it since the new setup.
[0:13:53] 10000watts: its like white noise/noise cancelling type
[0:13:54] Ionized4: dawg
[0:13:54] survhunterdream: just turn it down a lil lol
[0:13:55] Hred5: set volume to 100% and u hear it max
[0:13:57] Dzor12: Idk what to tell you lmao. I can hear it

[0:14:15] Jarlan23: thats just him breathing chat
[0:14:15] JustinFromFlorida: Its there all the time. Just your voice and all sound is perfect  the static sits in the background.
[0:14:24] roookai: i wouldnt hear it if i was at a normal volume lmao
[0:14:25] astralfoxAWOO: rawr
[0:14:30] thegrt13: chat trying to gatekeep smh
[0:14:38] Gamerhcp: It's probably a capacitor in your monitor that went out
[0:14:40] dustin_handsupdb: It's 100% just noise floor coming up as part of the gain staging. Do you use a Cloudlifter? It would probably help you have lower gain on your interface and clean that up.
[0:14:44] Gamerhcp: One of your monitors
[0:14:53] poubellegames: time to analyze some systems
[0:14:53] dustin_handsupdb: What @Gamerhcp is saying
[0:14:59] dustin_handsupdb: it's 100% environmental
[0:15:00] Boreall: Good morning
[0:15:02] Brocep: Max is a bot, you're just hearing the whirring of his gears Kappa
[0:15:03] fleks27: is it 3 or 4 per cup that go through
[0:15:19] demepunkk: more audio problems?
[0:15:28] YayFiber: audio chat is just making up words. hit your jugulator with the flexinor
[0:15:33] secretstormtwitch: You sound 100% fine
[0:15:37] Dzor12: It's not a huge deal. I'll just get used to it @maximum
[0:15:46] altopstra: music louder pls dogJAM
[0:15:49] pissekatten: when is MDI? in how many hours?
[0:15:52] 10000watts: is the cable physically touching anything that has electricity?
[0:15:54] asuhdude44: open ur stream and ull hear it
[0:15:58] dustin_handsupdb: <literally sound engineer. It could be something as simple as a filter cap went in your big TV or monitor and it's just making abit of noise that's getting picked up by your high af impedance mic or headphones.
[0:16:02] demepunkk: dogJAM
[0:16:03] CmasterJr: we'll be fine once there is audio other than just the soft music
[0:16:03] Gamerhcp: @pissekatten 20 mins

[0:16:38] Dzor12: No
[0:16:38] demepunkk: oh wait i hear static nvm

[0:16:39] Hred5: its kinda worse honestly
[0:16:39] OriginalKuro: wait, its worse
[0:16:39] Godchiller: no
[0:16:40] astralfoxAWOO: yes

[0:16:58] ewevix: its worse xD
[0:16:59] Raynebough: oh I hear it now too
[0:17:00] Boreall: You're getting one guy'd

[0:17:02] altopstra: nothing wrong here
[0:17:02] Hred5: volume 100% and u heart it
[0:17:03] PJs_Banana: @astralfoxAWOO just on my work macbook pro speakers lol
[0:17:03] CmasterJr: ITS WORSE
[0:17:05] asuhdude44: yea its worse
[0:17:05] Ahrmanhamma: It's fluctuating, so whatever you just did may have affected it. Were you jiggling cables?
[0:17:05] Hred5: hear it *
[0:17:07] JansonLives: oh yeah. I hear it
[0:17:07] dustin_handsupdb: Yeah it goes away 100% once your talking or more audio volume comes through, which tells me it's environmental noise floor picking up.
[0:17:08] mickeythug: yep, worse
[0:17:08] logain_13: @Maximum what headphones do you use?
[0:17:09] KineasRM: Its only on 720p?
[0:17:11] shankthat123: its so faint stop
[0:17:11] whimward: It's really not that big of a deal tho
[0:17:11] Gamerhcp: No hat Pog
[0:17:13] JackOfAllApocalypses: I hear it on my headset, but not on speaker
[0:17:14] itsXekko: hear what? sounds fine
[0:17:16] ewevix: its ALOT of static
[0:17:16] Hred5: KEKW
[0:17:21] fleks27: is it some pc part going wild
[0:17:23] fleks27: OMEGALUL
[0:17:24] Boreall: I have your volume at 100 and I hear no static at all
[0:17:29] m1lkman10: If you can't hear it, youre probably super old and can't here anything
[0:17:32] OG_Kawngi: buy a new house Stare

[0:19:35] OG_Kawngi: actually maybe just muted? loll

[0:20:07] Gamerhcp: Chat he unplugged the cable that's why you can't hear anything

[0:22:59] Hred5: special processing ?
[0:23:00] Saylorr: iPhone mic as audio source gg
[0:23:01] d0mezg4mer: I personally hope the noise gate doesn't cut out any of the puppers playing with their toys though

[0:23:48] therealborko: you can also put a gat in OBS
[0:23:49] tastyfetacheese: what audio program is that?
[0:23:51] dustin_handsupdb: It is 100% not worth the difference. The issue is not with your audio gear.
[0:23:54] Godchiller: thats proffesional stuuff we uuse it for stage sounnd

[0:24:16] toastbam: @kiratank_tv yo kira
[0:24:17] ThreesFG: @Lynvand stream can sound very different depending on the speakers/headphones/output device
[0:24:21] Nickystr1x: well i certainly didnt have this as max's joker origin story in the fanfic
[0:24:25] jarmotron: it would work, but if you use hearback from the interface, you will still hear it
[0:24:28] amandag94: I would see if someone from Team Liquid IT can come take a look for you. Buy them pizza or something for it.
[0:24:29] kiratank_tv: @toastbam yoyo
[0:24:31] Clarius: it wont be noticeable once there is other talk and sounds tbh
[0:24:35] winterstretch: can you show the options again?
[0:24:39] therealborko: should still work, anything else is gonna drown out the static

[0:25:00] Dzor12: If it's tiny then any sound from like videos would be loud enough to go over the gate
[0:25:01] fleks27: sound issues are a mindset, the elevated mind can just blank it out
[0:25:10] ArchieSin: @Maximum who all are you co streaming with?
[0:25:12] kiratank_tv: no raid announce? rip

[0:26:09] WHOisROXIS: thats just a bit whitenoise
[0:26:12] Saylorr: am i deaf? I literally can't hear anything different
[0:26:13] LSDAlINight: its gotta be the aliens
[0:26:14] zalkian: zalkian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! ejoo
[0:26:15] amandag94: but really, you said you wanted to hire someone about your set up. I would message some of the IT peeps at the Team Liquid Facility to take a look and pay them or bribe them with food. I’m sure they would be happy to help! they love problem solving this stuff. @maximum
[0:26:16] tastyfetacheese: Audio is coming in clear for me?
[0:26:18] ewevix: where is your phone?
[0:26:20] whimward: idk guys. It's not that bad on my end.

[0:26:30] GuilherMELHOR: where can I find the rosters? mdi site has only groups and team names 󠀀
[0:26:31] Clarius: really wont be noticable when ur talking and other people are talking
[0:26:32] Ultratide_: if you cant hear static, get ur ears checked asap
[0:26:32] logain_13: @Saylorr Might also depend on your speakers/headphones
[0:26:33] therealborko: pick up some EMI pucks
[0:26:34] REDSUNDERGROUND: that  is 100%interference
[0:26:34] WHOisROXIS: whitenoise
[0:26:34] isostope: i hear it
[0:26:37] KineasRM: i mean, i use twitch at 20% volume and i cant hear it

[0:27:08] JackOfAllApocalypses: when you talk it's mostly unnoticeable
[0:27:09] Ultratide_: What mixer are you using max?
[0:27:10] dr__mantis_toboggan_md: @Maximum there are gates built into SSL channel strips or Neve channel strips inside the UAD Console if it will send you to the shadow realm listening to it
[0:27:10] winterstretch: how hard are you pushing the gain for your mic?
[0:27:11] JansonLives: how does it sound w/ the music from the MDI stream?
[0:27:11] nanerpus_: INCEPTION
[0:27:11] Godchiller: try to use the obs gate its under filters for ur mic input
[0:27:13] Jarlan23: fucking eardrums i hate em
[0:27:14] emperoxblue: why is it every time to co-stream MDI something breaks?
[0:27:15] Swinefluizsik: If I turn stream down to not hear it I also can't hear you
[0:27:16] REDSUNDERGROUND: it  sounds like pickup  interference tbh
[0:27:17] therealborko: wait, you don't have phantom power enabled accidentally do you?
[0:27:20] demoncplague: i have u up fully and dont hear it
[0:27:20] rangermonk: So is it electrical then?
[0:27:20] JDsteadi: these talking pictures are just a fad anyways, video only is based
[0:27:26] Monsuno: DM Linus Tech Tips for a collab
[0:27:26] tastyfetacheese: Unshielded cables? Move other electronic devices from your area
[0:27:27] logain_13: It's not too bad with the music over the top of it
[0:27:27] fronkacean: lets go mdi!!!
[0:27:28] wiickiid: I've had a bad ground in the electrical I was plugged into cause a similar issue
[0:27:29] 54714: who is playing in this cup?
[0:27:32] JustinFromFlorida: You cant really hear it over the MDI Sounds. So it should be fine.
[0:27:34] tastyfetacheese: move your phone
[0:27:39] Hred5: KEKW
[0:27:46] winterstretch: phantom power is on the device not the mixer
[0:27:46] NerdRagedOut: music hides it anyway, don’t even stress.
[0:27:47] Zaisx: bro spoke another language
[0:27:49] itsRMP: it gets drowned out by the other music honestly, can only hear if its just you talking
[0:27:50] paulormsj: paulormsj subscribed with Prime. 
[0:27:54] poubellegames: what hardware mixer are you sing?

[0:27:59] Quaenor: I once had a similar problem, try move around the XLR cable away from any power cables/outlets… that solved it for me
[0:28:03] troxleer: garf
[0:28:07] CmasterJr: Garf
[0:28:07] bartholimu: garf
[0:28:09] demepunkk: interesting
[0:28:10] Godchiller: check uunder innputs there should be a buutton for 48v power
[0:28:11] patti221: its almost undetectable though.
[0:28:12] JDsteadi: it isnt noticeable at all if there's anything else going on audio-wise
[0:28:13] Hred5: Garf
[0:28:14] 10000watts: wouldnt that require him to have a phantom power source in the first place
[0:28:15] Quaenor: in case you are using XLR
[0:28:16] jhopps12: phantom power is a good suggestion from that chatter, actually
[0:28:22] therealborko: never used a UAD interface so I don't know where the toggle would be, but phantom power to a dynamic mic could do some shit like that
[0:28:27] Ultratide_: ya its undetectable if he has wow music blasting lmao
[0:28:28] Zaisx: I don't hear personally, so let's just get hyped
[0:28:31] Clarius: cant hear it over the music so just have music on all the time
[0:28:31] CmasterJr: gard
[0:28:32] ttreeti: what is it browser?
[0:28:32] grimrrrr: just dont stop talking and no problem
[0:28:40] Webchika: As much as a I want a new mixer stuff like this is why I've basically said F it and I don't touch it now that I've got decent output sound lol
[0:28:41] CmasterJr: firstGarf
[0:28:44] TheKEK: IDK WHAT U JUST DID but ths static disapeared for like 1 second
[0:28:49] therealborko: go to inputs
[0:28:52] PiaanoMain: real dumb IT question, but have you tried the other Analog port?
[0:28:54] ewevix: o oh, horse leaks

[0:29:11] Eynar27: @Maximum any predictions for todays matchups?
[0:29:14] Godchiller: uunnder iputs there is a setting for 48v phantom power
[0:29:22] Childz: do you have any of your audio cables running along power cables?  that can cause audio interference.  if they need to be by each other they should cross like in a t shape.
[0:29:23] Quaenor: for real, try move the XLR cable around a bit and see if anything changes
[0:29:31] Dzor12: MDI LETS GO USA
[0:29:33] ewevix: any powercables near the sound cables?
[0:29:37] therealborko: ITS ON
[0:29:40] Godchiller: ok phanntom is on
[0:29:43] therealborko: the 48V buttom
[0:29:45] dustin_handsupdb: PHANTOM IS ON
[0:29:46] therealborko: press that
[0:29:46] jhopps12: the +48V button, turn it off
[0:29:46] Ahrmanhamma: Looks like the Star Trek shit
[0:29:48] winterstretch: you should turn it off
[0:29:48] Childz: +48v is phantom power
[0:29:51] eveecat: eveecat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! is it MDI TIME?!?
[0:29:51] dustin_handsupdb: That +48V SHOULDNT BE ON

[2:27:12] JansonLives: I know my tiny little server has people playing higher keys longer into the season than past.
[2:27:14] gunethersnuf: NGL luigis mansion coming back in the key rotation brought me back
[2:27:27] Wiikz: no they are obviously lazy lol
[2:27:28] MaliciousDH: they care more about MDI, then the actual game
[2:27:30] fragileplasma: @fadingsurrealist A group thats doing "only 22s" will have deaths to that and its just annoying and shouldnt be in the game, thats a garbage take
[2:27:30] Tresku: IM REALLY disappointed in lack of diversity among the castes, all white - entitled, outrageous.
[2:27:38] ifacerolled: Have a feeling that S4 will only be Dragonflight dungeons
[2:27:41] nekitamocika: S2 was dog water, both DNGs and Raid
[2:27:45] guynormally: @gunethersnuf but no bowser's castle PoroSad
[2:27:50] Ziracc: @Tresku weak bait
[2:27:50] Tigerklaue: dire wolves Prayge
[2:27:53] antipheonixna: growls point is if they are gonna fix the dungeons fix it as the issues come and not all at the end

[2:28:10] deviljin____: @Tresku mods are asleep?
[2:28:10] thenateo2: Pog
[2:28:12] LordScrooblord: it's bad when these dungeons have been around for 5+ years
[2:28:13] semifive: They can't play varied specs for your enjoyment when there is money on the line.  You play the best specs to win.
[2:28:14] ewevix: i think its just prio, other stuff is more important, and then when mdi is close they work through the bug list
[2:28:14] codydoubleu: make it look good for MDI viewers vs make it feel good for every player doing keys for months
[2:28:18] iDeez88: Not 1 legendary user in MDI, good system
[2:28:24] 225oce: turn up stream?
[2:28:25] larkhill: no heals?

[2:28:39] Reznr: holy
[2:28:39] kesslive: The frustrating report is these bugs were reported in ptr

[2:29:27] iDeez88: totem boss?
[2:29:28] Sharrubo: priest buff without healer?
[2:29:31] Fire_chomp: why heal when your comp can just live everything
[2:29:31] gunethersnuf: they have a shadow priest to heal :P

[2:30:12] targus92dd: @ewevix true, just hope they dont make it into esport
[2:30:17] fragileplasma: So they have a lot of off healing
[2:30:25] murloc_oracle: they got 2 birds and miniboss pack right?
[2:30:25] iDeez88: my god, this pull with no healer....

[2:33:58] larkhill: healer = wipe
[2:33:59] murloc_kingkiller: wiping with a healer is wild
[2:34:00] ewevix: healer diff
[2:34:02] ValkyW: seems like teams always miss something this pull

[2:35:12] Faraday5001: @Boreall old, bald, and grumpy
[2:35:13] scorgie1994: vampiric embrace
[2:35:28] みょせつ: @Boreall cause healing already feels unrewarding as shit and then seeing people not even bringing one just doesn't feel great i suppose

[2:41:17] Suwah84: why even hold back. they could give people their routes ahead a time and still win @maximum
[2:41:18] Chkndh: they are probs practicing with a healer because key levels will go up in the finals
[2:41:19] LucasSterling_: by the time finals come around, they will probably have new tech, but for the time being, this is probably they're best route

[2:42:25] srze94: as a healer I think they should remove 50% of the sustain/defensives the classes have
[2:42:26] MisterNioce: I mean, counter argument. You CANNOT 4dps pushing keys so. Somewhat irrelevant to rage about 4dps on MDI ye?
[2:42:31] Sukodin: All you saying JB salty are the same people that shit on Aug being meta and not your spec....
[2:42:34] azurehq: i mean the thing JB is talking about is not the usual M+ thing ... there will always be a healer even after MDI no Heal runs

[3:50:34] knersh_: @radhunt good job you noticed it
[3:50:35] weazem: mistweevil
[3:50:36] cerberar: I mean the chance of getting a terrible mage in your pug key seems to be a lot higher than other classes
[3:50:36] kj01a: mages just switch to ele shaman so they can actually get into raid
[3:50:38] fleks27: they should nerf mage aoe
[3:50:38] klappe92: Lepan in Cata dungeons GIGACHAD

[3:51:18] kingpeace09: will we see any other tank in other dungeons?
[3:51:19] Jazzy_WoW: oh, good point by dratnos: arcane barrier is 15% magic DR
[3:51:20] PurityV2: @cerberar cries in 3400 bracket, mages are so 50/50 man
[3:51:28] nyshindysheen: no ret in the MDI? ret needs a buff cant change my mind
[3:51:38] Celynae: @cerberar Good mages have a 20% procrate, with -2% per key level above 23
[3:51:42] CmasterJr: @cerberar had a 463 mage doing less dmg than my dad's rdruid :V
[3:51:48] Thasin22: splat still a liquid raider?
[3:51:59] vente97: @nyshindysheen legendary didn't drop,so no ret Kappa
[3:52:06] taistelija23: @nyshindysheen ret is great in hands of a 3000-3500 player, but its just not good enough to push the highest keys
[3:52:09] mehayla: @CmasterJr skill issue
[3:52:31] wildcherrybepsi: i really think it is just a mage diff
[3:52:34] parano2: why spriest?
[3:52:35] FelixC4S: i play mage at 3500 and I didnt even press alter time once
[3:52:38] Kinzarro: ret just has aoe cap, thats why

[3:53:20] taistelija23: @taistelija23 by highest keys i just meant keys at the highest level, my mistake. Unclear message
[3:53:24] Cakerinotv: ret was played in time trials in place of aug in 4dps comps, I bet aug was mathed out to be better overal for 4dps comps but ret is def not bad
[3:53:26] Scoops__: definitely a we're so ahead so why risk it
[3:53:33] taistelija23: @taistelija23 slightly more dmg than ret but half the utility. dead spec
[3:53:35] fragileplasma: Ret just doesnt do prio damage, esp without Legendary
[3:53:40] fragileplasma: Its full pad
[3:53:50] syzurup: isn't that gonna mess up your CD timings though?
[3:53:52] nickelvc: @fragileplasma this
[3:53:56] DevilsfuryLive: i swear dratnos is listning in to your guys chat
[3:53:58] nyshindysheen: true sadge

[3:54:13] taistelija23: @DevilsfuryLive Pepega
[3:54:15] parano2: lol if u think ret isnt that good, what do u think about fury warrior?
[3:54:18] TonyCookGaming: Ret isn't bad, but MDI doesn't really leave room for not bad specs
[3:54:22] nyshindysheen: mage can tho
[3:54:24] nickelvc: @taistelija23 definitely can, mage spriest
[3:54:26] marfuska13: what do you think Echo was practicing not killing the totem and focusing boss?

[3:54:31] ghostpvp: Is this a crank?
[3:54:32] Lara_TV_: Pretty funny they show PoM for arcane instead of Surge/Touch
[3:54:33] Armostallion: BatChest Arcane Mage
[3:54:36] Scoops__: oh it is arcane didnt even realize
[3:54:41] Naimiria: WICKED arcane go brr
[3:54:41] yonima: no the lock
[3:54:44] vente97: lock
[3:54:46] taistelija23: @taistelija23 I meant that ret doesnt have it
[3:54:46] radhunt: no
[3:54:47] Kinzarro: Arcane doesnt want haste
[3:54:49] peggann: why are they tracking presence of mind instead of arcane surge lol
[3:54:49] nalegi07: the timings are weird for PI
[3:54:50] radhunt: they PIing desdtro
[3:54:51] Taytor: Arcane is not good with pi
[3:54:53] honeychonker: Arcane PI not that good
[3:54:53] みょせつ: p good
[3:54:54] fleks27: only outside of lusts if anything, destro always has value
[3:54:56] gregl__: tis meh on st
[3:55:00] artthanlol: Destro is insane with pi
[3:55:01] czarthelord: It's probably PI arcane on ST situations
[3:55:03] Lara_TV_: Arcane is really good for PI outside of double lust but it has to line up with the SP for it to be worth
[3:55:03] Scoops__: destro definitely wants it
[3:55:06] nyshindysheen: arc can ST more than fire not? i thought fire was more AoE?
[3:55:06] fleks27: you would never pi arcane during lusts
[3:55:09] Deatheran: destro PI is cracked
[3:55:09] darkvengerdkay: arcane not good with PI
[3:55:11] fragileplasma: You dont PI arcane on their lusts and it doesnt line up very well
[3:55:11] TheRelativeGenius: destro is 3 mions though
[3:55:13] vente97: they talked about it earlier, using it on the 3 min destro cd
[3:55:20] honeychonker: Arcane already gets double lust
[3:55:23] Lara_TV_: @Kinzarro that isn't really true
[3:55:25] metel7: nah guys it literally just hopeful memeing
[3:55:27] radhunt: arcane mage PI is worse than tank
[3:55:28] Atari_Safari: What team is DrJay on?
[3:55:32] guynormally: it's on destro 100%
[3:55:43] Bug_Byte: @radhunt clueless
[3:55:44] azm07: why u didnt recruit Hopeful before echo did @Maximum
[3:55:55] Yagr6: just plays ele
[3:55:56] punkekw: fire doing typical tank dps xD
[3:56:01] LazerBeemz: @azm07 Imfiredup
[3:56:01] Lara_TV_: Damn no one knows anything about arcane huh
[3:56:03] pyrorithm: Arcane has turbo funneled prio damage which is giga in this key. Fire has good prio damage but less funnel
[3:56:07] Ignite_CLO: @azm07 because you dont need 2 turbo mage mains
[3:56:08] ShadowDuelist21: Frost mage KEKW

[3:57:42] kj01a: link that weakaura
[3:57:48] sorliee: Wonder if any EU/NA players actually stick around playing on the other region, i imagine it usually burns out players cause of schedule diffs.
[3:57:56] ghostfox888: @Zaisx Thanks

[3:58:48] rukt: the squid in 2nd phase can parry for some reason
[3:58:50] guynormally: Pepega dps brain
[3:59:02] Slapsstick: "hm this boss will live like 20 seconds... ill save for the Amp" - me
[3:59:04] sedael: @Yagr6 no but only because its not counted on meters
[3:59:06] OG_Kawngi: big number good ok
[3:59:10] Saahf: but big numbers are kinda sick to see tho
[3:59:11] Ionized4: holy insta town portal GIGACHAD
[3:59:16] St0rmbr3ak3r: I've had groups lust the last 10s there
[3:59:18] elpotatto: dorki is just a mage simp

[3:59:30] nalegi07: dog getting a good ass lick in
[3:59:33] d4gge: Any guide or something how to do that on details
[3:59:36] Cakerinotv: BASED
[3:59:50] SeargentFish: Well yeah, hitting alunsa does nothing
[3:59:50] Aro725: @d4gge it does it automatically
[3:59:50] Ionized4: @d4gge spell list -> npc list
[3:59:58] Trair: @d4gge importing someones profile is easiest
[4:00:00] Yagr6: dog half ass on couch
[4:00:15] radhunt: it does it for ozumat automatically but you can hide various smallies and spiteful shades etc too
[4:00:30] BizzlexJB: Did  dorki team go yet?
[4:00:33] nalegi07: arcane is probably crazy value on ravagers
[4:00:34] xxMaverick: what that dog doin
[4:00:34] iBrennan: what the dog doin?
[4:00:37] nalegi07: with big burns

[4:00:51] MisterNioce: TOTT timer is just missing 3mins if feels like
[4:00:54] theslinny: only 1 single 30 has been timed
[4:00:56] theslinny: tyran

[4:01:28] aidan_pryde: @Maximum 30th tyranical boss 1 shots all the specs. last night hiea was sitting there, trying to clean kill it for 2 hours

[4:01:35] simonromlie: I think Andys time managed to kil 3rd boss TOTT +31 on tournament realm which took them A LOT of wipes
[4:01:39] aidan_pryde: @Maximum 3rd boss*
[4:01:41] sgtcheck6: Because you can't play destro in an 18. Is dogshit what do you mean
[4:01:48] cbodx10: is your dog good?
[4:01:52] VIEGAS_PT: @BizzlexJB last hope
[4:01:53] ctesiph: @Maximum Destro came out of newhere.
[4:01:56] ghostfox888: DK will always be my main no matter what
[4:02:00] larkhill: destro does a lot worse in lower keys where tanks just drag mobs outside of fire
[4:02:03] みょせつ: dog is stuck in time
[4:02:04] wildcherrybepsi: Hopeful diff
[4:02:05] Erracious: would mage still be in these comps without lust? @Maximum
[4:02:06] clickermekk: You mean Legendary?
[4:02:06] Shmikal: wrong names
[4:02:11] Boreall: Nah Max it's an Arcane Diffy
[4:02:22] brashmage: Production F, drink.
[4:02:24] cbodx10: check on the dog
[4:02:35] BizzlexJB: Thanks
[4:02:35] みょせつ: production is ass today wtf
[4:02:37] Lunamhm: @BizzlexJB last hope
[4:02:41] sgtcheck6: Destro is good in big keys or rather big pulls. Demo dmg profile takes a while to go off. Destro you just press 3 instant buttons and dmg is off
[4:02:42] brashmage: Dog need to go potty?
[4:02:54] cbodx10: why won’t the dog move
[4:02:55] nickelvc: dh chains dps ++
[4:02:59] glick66: for arcane, is crazy how stacking is OP
[4:03:11] dat_combatwombat: tell that to my team they start blasting dps the moment i start trying to group LUL

[4:03:33] DarkseaWoW: what da dog doin
[4:03:34] weezull: @yonsei_ true, go restart him
[4:03:36] ctesiph: @Maximum I always thought a good tank is the best party buff you can have in a m+. If your tank is group and your team isnt swamp ass, you can time very high keys
[4:03:36] paiku_druid: I think that definitely depends on the specs you're playing with, feral aoe just hits everything all the time
[4:03:37] chazavier: chazavier subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! cokking
[4:03:42] spiritcheese: @DarkseaWoW won YEP
[4:03:44] charlie_bangles1: lol, your dog looks so uncomfortable right now
[4:03:48] sepulchre94: can i pet dat dawg
[4:03:57] Gloriance: is the dog leaning against the couch?
[4:04:05] Lara_TV_: It's huge for Arcane, for whether or not Arcane Echo/Touch cleaves

[4:04:07] ctesiph: @Maximum *tank is good
[4:04:12] TonyCookGaming: Cries in ret paladin
[4:04:15] chazavier: can you ask jb is master shapeshifter worth yet
[4:04:17] Shmikal: epidemic does more the closer things are to each other
[4:04:23] Shmikal: its why u would pad so hard in halls of atonement
[4:04:25] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/6tAoHx to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[4:04:36] Aro725: imagine being able to hit more than 6 targets, couldnt be me(enhance)
[4:04:57] thendj: vdh does it better on a shorter cd lol
[4:05:01] weezull: people found other ways to stack mobs up
[4:05:03] FlashSib: veng just better
[4:05:03] Garzag_: sigil of chains OMEGALUL
[4:05:04] ungnyaa: maybe because blizzard made big mobs immune to grips
[4:05:05] Larocca_88: i literally remember JB saying this beginning of BFA
[4:05:05] thegrip1: they nerfed it
[4:05:06] Kinzarro: they gave it to DH
[4:05:11] Slapsstick: cant even take it in most live keys LUL
[4:05:15] BLACKFOOT_TN: DH chains
[4:05:15] nickelvc: mass grip is in an absolutely brutal place in the spec tree
[4:05:16] Fysicalx: chains is just better, no?
[4:05:17] Emiltharia: The amount of single target stops a DK can do is insane
[4:05:18] NerdRagedOut: why don’t DK’s use grip for interrupt anymore?
[4:05:18] fragileplasma: @thendj Yeah but take last ssn for example, bear dont have any grips lol
[4:05:21] dustin_handsupdb: You don't take mass as BDK cause it's so cursed to get on the tree
[4:05:25] Baskkov: this is last map, right?
[4:05:31] fragileplasma: People just group the mobs better nowadays
[4:05:37] Baskkov: dungeon rather
[4:05:39] deviljin____: People figured out line of sighting works better
[4:05:41] zachdr: grip on gcd worst change
[4:05:44] quarantedeux: people got better at los pulling
[4:05:52] BLACKFOOT_TN: Druids with Vortex and Typhoon tech sometimes.
[4:05:53] klappe92: Silence sigil / divine toll exists now which helps with grouping
[4:05:55] iDeez88: warrior grip when
[4:05:56] clickermekk: the talent u have to drop to take Gorefiends grasp into keys is annoying
[4:05:57] beyonddivinee: @zachdr yeah i hate it
[4:05:58] gunethersnuf: too many casters are immune, and need kicks to move
[4:05:59] ghostfox888: Grip never show up on the meters thats why.
[4:05:59] Alligatir: VH tank is like the same as having grips right
[4:06:00] VerskTV: more and more mobs are becoming immune to grips
[4:06:00] Antikostantis: Yeah cause vdh is huge
[4:06:02] fragileplasma: Losing, kicking the right mobs, using chain knocks, etc
[4:06:05] M__Wolfe: Most of the mobs yo uwant to grip/need to grip are immune
[4:06:12] Mr_Skiddy_Pants: grip is just a kick
[4:06:13] TheSHAYdynasty: @NerdRagedOut i still use grips as stops
[4:06:15] M__Wolfe: And Vdh have drips too
[4:06:17] ungnyaa: COPIUM
[4:06:18] M__Wolfe: grips
[4:06:18] fragileplasma: Pathing better is also huge
[4:06:19] Naimiria: bro half the affixes and mobs are immune to grips
[4:06:19] TyHeals: VH grips why do we need dks
[4:06:29] Antikostantis: grip now is just for stops, Vdh just use sigils and gg
[4:06:31] bullrag99: i feel like grip has infinite value where there are spread casters
[4:06:50] antipheonixna: ppl literally BatChest when dks have 1 fight they use grips that are real important and forget about them, dk grip is nice but its always cope, think about how much cc a druid can do
[4:06:50] Dremlin12: @Maximum BDK right now cant even survive in keys
[4:06:52] chipsychips: some1 has the clip with the drattynice
[4:06:52] ghostfox888: AD
[4:06:55] TheRelativeGenius: AD
[4:06:58] Shmikal: mass grip in shadowlands kinda just became another aoe stop instead of "this is great for positioning"
[4:07:00] timmytothic: AD
[4:07:07] nisou033: Do u guys think vdh is at the same level as bear last season ?
[4:07:10] vente97: we also got a lot of meta ranged dps now, so ranged kicks help with grouping
[4:07:20] M__Wolfe: Everything DK had has been given to other classes and now theyre irrelevant
[4:07:20] ewevix: last match?
[4:07:28] wandering_chacos: Bdk main - it's basically inting to grab mass grip rn
[4:07:30] FlashSib: ye
[4:07:32] Aro725: LOL
[4:07:34] rexxantik: tobo got the dogs out
[4:07:47] m1lkman10: What are you gonna do to stay entertained tomorrow?
[4:07:55] m1lkman10: Nvm
[4:08:05] TheRelativeGenius: As a BDK in keys I feel pushed into dropping grip for dps or survivability
