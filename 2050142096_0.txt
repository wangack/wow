[1:21:04] BajeniZta: @Payo when do u come to eu ?
[1:21:05] nikola420tesla: Bots and Gold buying will still be a thing.  All the good BOE's on the AH are going to be 5X the price now because gold buyers need somewhere to spend the gold

[1:26:26] give_me_a_1_in_chat: 90% of my guild in 2019 classic bought gold just for consumes. people are fucking delusional if they think this somehow stops it
[1:26:29] nikola420tesla: Its not going lower, its going higher because gold buyers will pump all their gold into good AH boe's
[1:26:32] wibez84: The problem with GDKP is just the botting. You would never need 50 000 gold in wow classic if it wasn’t for GDKP=so much more bots
[1:26:34] rizcitron: a friend of me ofc, told me that gold price went down by 50% on illegal website

[1:30:24] morticianbuera: give good example to all and permaban SOdapoping
[1:30:25] gurknel: people just use burner accounts
[1:30:26] ProClicker: If they banned people for buying gold 75% of the players would be banned
[1:30:26] c7oudx: c7oudx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[1:30:28] str8masta: ofc they should ban soda
[1:30:33] mermaidkween: @Korben_dallas5 can't prime on mobile unfortunately

[1:30:53] Alizuzs: if they organize the whole gdkp only in discord how will they know they did gdkp
[1:30:53] Lucbass: we should make server discords and communicate and advertise runs. It will be like gdkp speakeasys. Shhhhh
[1:30:57] LRGee: i think they have a way to track gold
[1:30:58] morticianbuera: no they can track down when gold come from
[1:30:58] gurknel: they can see when people trade or mail large amounts of gold
[1:31:00] muhfin: interacting with flagged accounts
[1:31:01] give_me_a_1_in_chat: they ban the seller and then  see who they sold to via trades mail etc
[1:31:01] xTrueEast: love it when you kill a bot 3 times in a row and they respawn and go right back to the script lol
[1:31:04] OptimusPrimePleb: fuck no, they cant even afford GMs
[1:31:04] nabewa: mass report by a botter
[1:31:06] hidron99: BUR
