[2:07:34] Cisco_CWF: maybe its elvui
[2:07:35] Harusame12: elvui removes the access through blizz menus from memory
[2:07:38] CritcobainTV: it could be elvui since it's a ui addon

[2:07:42] Cisco_CWF: and u need to go into elvui to change the scale?

[2:45:38] cptrogers123: you wouldnt?`i would literally hate it
[2:45:56] cptrogers123: i would hate levelling again
[2:46:09] Biorrwolf: "A little bit"

[2:49:16] DrWafflesaurus: a 320 mob mara pull, the total blizzard dmg will be divided by 320, so each tic will hit for like 1 dmg. it will take a longggg time to make each run happen and the booster will likely make a mistake at some point.

[3:04:06] Kvistlol: What's the hardest tank to learn and do higher keys on?
[3:04:10] Biorrwolf: You get a perpetual death metal aesthetic
[3:04:11] Armdel: does bear tanks have less active mitigation than other tanks?
[3:04:18] stijn0416: pally easy ?
[3:04:29] Liekabauws: BDK is pretty hard to play atm BUT they are looking really good in 9.1 so far
[3:04:37] Barralgul: dh are also easier than other tanks
[3:04:46] cptrogers123: Not vengeance demonhunter?
[3:04:49] ohnot___her: Ive been tanking since cata and I STILL dont understand DK
[3:04:54] Templexx: regardless of keys its prob pally tho right?
[3:05:00] Fhirn: legion blood was nice
[3:05:03] nihilistic_bat: DH has the least amount of buttons, either spec. and yes VDH can be easy, but bear is easier
[3:05:25] vegas3t: DH is easy, yes, but it does require a bit of skill when kiting and not getting hit
[3:05:53] Liekabauws: spirit bomb is dead i think, it's a meme atm

[3:29:21] Glynn11: @TweakT I hope you're right. it'll be a bummer if finding groups for raids becomes a chore
[3:29:35] Nico_vdM: They need to change it to kiss/curse
[3:29:52] TweakT: I mean it depends if classic servers get merged or not
[3:30:02] KaisenSiru: Next week will be a good week. Storming and Inspiring, Fort
[3:30:17] Glynn11: right, I think that'll be the move
[3:30:51] Caanan20: I literally went up 10 reknown levels and finished my Campaign yesterday. lol from the fifth stage to completed in one day was nice
[3:31:16] NovaSun84: I think there are going to be a solid 5+ servers of classic mains.  I'm leaving my whole alliance server with 4 60s as Classic
[3:31:21] warrenny: Is it unhidable?
[3:32:16] egraves7: bob is a trustworthy name
[3:32:31] NovaSun84: As a Classic main, I wasn't really joining Blizzard's remaster of the first expansions.
[3:32:32] TweakT: only classes remaining on classic will be warriors & rogues OMEGALUL
[3:32:33] theavengingman: i thought you only paid if you wanted both

[3:32:41] shimwood: I had a meeting with some Bobs once
[3:32:47] Motivess: classic servers ran strong for private servers many times though
[3:32:56] NovaSun84: So you pay to duplicate your character
[3:33:01] ChiefMango: you chose either classic or tbc. if you want both you pay
[3:33:01] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[3:33:03] lanara233: yeah
[3:33:04] NovaSun84: Meaning you are on Classic, and you want to be on both.
[3:33:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Towelliee you can go to either ONE for free but if you want BOTH it costs money
[3:33:10] maccaruso: @shimwood That's because you are upper management material
[3:33:13] theavengingman: your character on a tBC server and classic
[3:33:13] momodani_modani: i think that transferring to BC OR staying is free but if you want both it costs $
[3:33:16] Nico_vdM: iirc you can choose what server you want to play on, but it will cost if you want to play on both
[3:33:17] NovaSun84: If you choose to stay on Classic, its no cost.  To my understanding
[3:33:30] TweakT: I bet it's gonna be $15
[3:33:31] theavengingman: NICA has it right
[3:33:38] theavengingman: NICO*
[3:33:55] Janigiv: nice way to milk some money @Towelliee
[3:34:00] ChiefMango: @Towelliee you can stay or go to classic era for free. if you want both you're gonna have to pay
[3:34:03] Glynn11: I'm not complaining about the cloning stuff, I'm just worried that the population on the classic servers is going to be dead if they don't merge enough
[3:34:06] ChidaRL: it is just a stupid tax for anyone choosing to stay in classic server
[3:34:11] fistofnature: Who here thinks they might not make it? LUL
[3:34:14] Xailen: More money, less work. Thats the blizzard way! Kappa
[3:34:47] Nico_vdM: You can stay in classic for free

[3:34:49] NovaSun84: that isn't true though
[3:34:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: you only pay if you want to play on BOTH
[3:34:51] Nico_vdM: or go to TBC
[3:34:53] Kinghorn: spend money to copy your character to dead classic servers
[3:34:53] ChiefMango: that's not how it work
[3:34:55] alundrius: as a deterant to keep people play the live server
[3:34:58] NovaSun84: If you CHOOSE Classic, its no money
[3:34:59] Nico_vdM: but it costs to play Classic AND TBC
[3:35:04] Motivess: @xailen no need to kappa that XD
[3:35:05] NovaSun84: If you CHOOSE to duplicate your character it costs money
[3:35:09] SI7ekeko: no you don't pay money if you want to stay
[3:35:11] ChiefMango: ou can stay or go to classic era for free. if you want both you're gonna have to pay
[3:35:12] Nico_vdM: No
[3:35:14] its_Steevee: the dupe is what costs money i thought
[3:35:19] Kinghorn: you pick 1 for free
[3:35:20] Nico_vdM: You can choose either TBC or Classic
[3:35:20] tigzie: nope
[3:35:22] warrenny: You pay for both classic only is free @towelliee
[3:35:22] Lopnk: you choose either to go Era or BC i thought
[3:35:23] Kinghorn: if you want both you pay
[3:35:24] Bedren: You dont
[3:35:28] Kinghorn: good question
[3:35:29] PhoenixAuTv: BC is FREE
[3:35:31] SI7ekeko: if you want to go to both then you pay
[3:35:35] Glynn11: idk I have a character or two I'll happily keep on classic and move over others
[3:35:36] NovaSun84: They are spawning off Classic servers
[3:35:36] Nico_vdM: Its two separate servers
[3:35:36] momodani_modani: bgs...?
[3:35:38] maccaruso: The $$$ is for having both a Classic character and BC character
[3:35:39] classictwo: to do both costs money
[3:35:45] classictwo: one or the other is free
[3:35:46] Nerendis: Hoping there are other idiots still playing classic
[3:35:46] Kinghorn: dunno who in their right mind would want to stay in classic but to each their own
[3:35:47] SheppurdTV: playing classic and boosting a toon for bc
[3:35:48] ChiefMango: @Towelliee they will clone and deactivate on the one you won't play on
[3:35:48] NovaSun84: So you will have Azuresong(Classic) Azuresong(TBC)
[3:35:57] PhoenixAuTv: Staying on Classic not BC you'd be by urself lmao
[3:36:04] TweakT: it's easy to stay on lowbie chars on classic and move forward with mains
[3:36:04] NovaSun84: Your classic characters are getting off the server of TBC players
[3:36:18] ShystyGaming: @Towelliee you get to pick
[3:36:25] Nico_vdM: You have to choose TBC or Classic, the game will ask you
[3:36:29] Bedren: 3 choices: stay classic (free) go tbc (free) clone a character so you can play both ($)
[3:36:31] ShystyGaming: classic or BC
[3:36:35] Shurn_82: You can chose to GOTO BC or STAY CLASSIC , to do Both costs
[3:36:35] Nico_vdM: It doesnt naturally progress to TBC
[3:36:35] SheppurdTV: only cost money to have char on both
[3:36:35] NovaSun84: Correct, and if you have a Azuresong(Classic) character, you won't see your TBC characters anymore
[3:36:39] ShystyGaming: this will be free wither choice
[3:36:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Towelliee you choose where you want to go on prepatch day that choice is free, if you decide you want both you pay money
[3:36:41] ChiefMango: true, and you can choose to go to classic instead loosing the option to go to BC. but you can pay to get both
[3:36:59] cobrauskis: Its one of those meaningful decisions
[3:37:00] Bedren: You get to choose
[3:37:04] Nerendis: I don't think there are Azursong tbc and classic. I think it's the same server, but with a level 60 lock (like in retail)
[3:37:17] Motivess: no way @hickorylive
[3:37:22] cptrogers123: your bear form is so fucking awesome, is there something similar to that
[3:37:23] ChiefMango: @HickoryLIVE there will be 2
[3:37:27] theoriginalzinng: are you using the trash legendary on your bear or the barkskin one?
[3:37:37] TweakT: question is, can I create classic vanilla chars after BC is out?
[3:37:37] Nimz83: Nimz83 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 39 years strong!
[3:37:38] NovaSun84: HickoryLIVE then you have level 59 twinks with TBC gear.  Fuck that
[3:37:46] ChiefMango: @Fille1809 sadly not possible to get anymore. was mage tower in legion
[3:37:52] Kinghorn: not even close
[3:37:52] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:38:21] NovaSun84: I'm pretty sure its Classic ONLY, TBC ONLY.  Then you pay to duplicate
[3:38:22] ChiefMango: @TweakT yes you can. on the classic era server
[3:38:24] Nerendis: Y'all are expecting a lot of "care for the future" from Blizzard. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's going to be amess
[3:38:25] cptrogers123: @ChiefMango damn, is there something a bit similar to it?
[3:38:26] Nico_vdM: According to WoW TBC page: "Force the Hand of Fate With the release of Burning Crusade Classic, new realm types will be added to WoW® Classic. If you already have characters on WoW Classic, you’ll have to choose what path your characters will take going forward.   Will you carry on to Outland and face the challenges beyond? Or will you remain a stalwart champion of Azeroth and continue to defend this world at war?"
[3:38:31] Motivess: I assume new classic servers are made and current ones upgrade to BC

[5:23:20] raymond3195: swtor was like that had to intrupt
[5:23:40] MuttonChopins: the 40 man raids were dumb cause you usually had to combine 2 guilds for 40 maans
[5:23:46] pyrocannibal00: all maxed rep, all gold dngs, all world bosses

[5:25:16] Taz_85: Even if they were alien creatures, their mount animations were badass. Smooth
[5:25:25] Taz_85: Alien horse ran like an actual horse
[5:25:30] EggwithEdges: I loved the hoverboards
[5:25:41] SilkeySmooth: if wildstar only had a faster leveling experience it wouldnt have died
[5:26:09] pyrocannibal00: i miss my hamster ball
[5:26:17] heavenphist: not to mention WOD alpha/beta was huge
[5:26:23] Kromede: and than WoD delivered nothing PepeWhy

[5:26:34] MuttonChopins: I miss my engineer pet tank class PepeHands
[5:26:36] EggwithEdges: NCSoft sold EU Aion to P2W company too, I'

[5:29:00] casualfury: meh
[5:29:28] DrakhanGaming: it was fun for a solid 2 months, pvp/arena was so awesome

[5:30:05] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:30:25] Gurtington_: blade n soul was a typical Korean mmorpg.  big titled anime girls and predictable story
[5:30:29] BRUTALIT0PS: I know the feeling pyrocannibal00 I HAVE five kids, and that eats into a lot of my playtime
[5:30:31] DrakhanGaming: im not sure what the hype is around ashes of creation, it doesnt seem special in anyway
[5:31:07] cptrogers123: LULW
[5:31:11] shimwood: Gotta kill the adds
[5:31:27] Kromede: did somebody say ketchup? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2-1basQhX8 KEKW
[5:31:34] pyrocannibal00: think that was another reason for wildstar. all i ever heard was, "this will kill wow all the hardcores will come to this" but by that time all vanillas were older with families lol
[5:31:43] Djdave3364: I think  the small red slimes make him take less damage
[5:31:48] josh8555: hate that elite he keeps healing lol
[5:31:57] Candy_Rainer: New World?
[5:32:02] pavepawns: is ashes still even happening?

[5:32:23] DrakhanGaming: star citizen LUL such a scam
[5:32:35] PhoenixAuTv: sorry same date as each other

[5:36:06] NASHOR: for sure, development eventually stalls and everyones there silently knowing the end is coming
[5:36:09] shadeofdark: Is the current Prot Warr fun in m+ ?
[5:36:14] shadeofdark: Retail
[5:36:18] Valestrus: @Towelliee hows MK out of 10

[5:37:31] DrakhanGaming: its already free online, so ill enjoy it
[5:37:44] Kromede: deep fried popcorn Kreygasm
[5:37:56] DrakhanGaming: warcraft shouldve been turned into a tv series
[5:37:56] BRUTALIT0PS: I enjoyed Warcraft. Not the best, but was decent
[5:38:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: im getting a pizza and a few pints of a 10% beer from my local brewery and im gonna watch MK tonight
[5:38:07] mavericks312: the fans are gonna generate enough money for MK
[5:38:09] Kromede: it was terrible
[5:38:10] YardRage: FeelsBadMan
[5:38:12] mastermode97: Hey man are u playing wow for real
[5:38:17] NovaSun84: it was a B movie, but I liked it for the cheesiness
[5:38:17] iamsolitary: now thats some silly gatekeeping
[5:38:19] Molvonos: I enjoyed the Warcraft movie.
[5:38:21] Gurtington_: I have warcraft on 4k uhd:)
[5:38:22] Zettabyte: Even I did watch the WoW movie at the cinema :)
[5:38:32] Skylin3r: wait, they made a warcraft movie? Kappa
[5:38:32] NovaSun84: I also liked Vikings, so he was cool as dude
[5:38:33] Aravarth: @Towelliee Went to the theatres and enjoyed it. To be fair, for critical acclaim purposes, it would have been a much more widely acclaimed film had it done a better job of explaining backstory to the non-players.
[5:38:35] BRUTALIT0PS: I remember buying Red Mt Dew to rep the Horde when they had the Alliance and Horde Mt Dews
[5:38:36] Sennica95: i went to the theatre on release and again witha buddy who was outta town
[5:38:40] BRUTALIT0PS: I want those back tbh
[5:38:44] warrenny: It was good as a wow player
[5:38:44] mastermode97: was a joke man sry
[5:38:46] Molvonos: But I went into it not expecting it to be anything other than a fictional movie.
[5:38:47] Kromede: ghetto version POGGERS
[5:38:54] JuveyUno: hey i waited till it was out of thearters xD
[5:39:03] Kinghorn: this is planet of fightbuilding
[5:39:16] toobaked1987: WildRift is an amazing mobile game
[5:39:33] BRUTALIT0PS: I have been to maybe 3 movies in the last 10 years and none in the last 6ish?
[5:39:48] BRUTALIT0PS: Last movie I saw in the theatre was American Sniper when it came out.
[5:39:56] Allora5: !TBC

[5:41:01] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:41:17] NovaSun84: Its like 30% faster in TBC though for classic leveling IIRC
[5:41:20] QQisLIVE: Vanilla leveling is its own beast lmao
[5:41:21] Allora5: Ahh roger. Do boosted characters include professions and such?
[5:41:22] magemaster225: need those pre-patch xp nerfs to kick in
[5:41:39] Barffbag: classic leveling was not enjoyable
[5:41:40] BRUTALIT0PS: No on professions if I am correct.
[5:41:55] YardRage: it wouldn't be a sloth if it arrived quickly
[5:42:02] nocontextlive: boost is level and base gear only
[5:42:07] DrakhanGaming: isnt leveling like 90% of classics content though? so if you hate it then whats the point
[5:42:12] KillaPr0: not available yet
[5:42:18] Fzbuddha: What up @Towelliee
[5:42:29] verdant85: sloth is tomorrow
[5:42:45] jkitchin75: but true
[5:42:51] Whoracle1337: Sloths are slow so it takes a while
[5:42:53] Whoracle1337: to get to you
[5:42:55] Exodeo_: A lot of travelling to and from quests too as I found out last night..
[5:42:56] BRUTALIT0PS: Leveling is 100% the base of Classic, but I enjoy the leveling experience. I think BC prepatch was best leveling in the game
[5:43:08] BRUTALIT0PS: It says within the next 24 hours
[5:43:21] Kromede: ion: ppl donate 1 mill, release the slot. dev: but sir it's not ready
[5:43:34] DreamWebb: nah its like 2 weeks to get to 60 you spend way more time on your toon after 60
[5:43:39] BRUTALIT0PS: Oh yeah Exodeo_ In some brackets you go all over the place because you have to for questing
[5:43:56] DrakhanGaming: what is endgame like in TBC
[5:44:10] QQisLIVE: Are your sub notifications working ?
[5:44:16] BRUTALIT0PS: I have been playing off and on for over a month now and I am only 49 LUL
[5:44:22] kappaday23: Kappa
[5:44:25] QQisLIVE: Or maybe its me
[5:44:31] mmrghost7: HOW FAR do u think  we are  from the tbc prepatch
[5:44:52] QQisLIVE: Prime sub aint worthy anymore haha
[5:44:58] BRUTALIT0PS: I am guessing 2 1/2 weeks away, but that's my personal guess.
[5:45:01] emeraldwrath: I bet you will have to go through the blizzard shop to get the sloth. similar to how we had to claim Bananas
[5:45:07] a_hudz: do you ever see blizz removing faction restrictions
[5:45:09] luckfore: Prepatch is 18th may they already datamined it
[5:45:20] jkitchin75: he knows
[5:45:39] peinen: I hope 9.1 and TBC launch aren't to close together
[5:45:44] Todmeister9000: he knows POGGERS
[5:46:08] Allora5: So we get prepatch and release date the same day?
[5:46:09] cyberratt: I haven't been paying attention to PTR. Do we need to be farming stygia for 9.1?
[5:46:10] Kromede: it may be, see what i did there Kappa
[5:46:13] BRUTALIT0PS: I just want BC to launch June 15th
[5:46:26] BRUTALIT0PS: My sons first birthday would be even more hyped
[5:46:35] SilkeySmooth: I'm ok with a long prepatch
[5:46:50] PhoenixAuTv: I hope to god 9.1 and tbc and diff release, i really wanna enjoy both. Not have to pick one fingers crossed
[5:46:54] Aravarth: lmaooo
[5:46:55] PhoenixAuTv: are
[5:46:56] beauds69: Do you have to level a classic character if you wanna play tbc?
[5:47:01] DrakhanGaming: Man I hate gaming droughts, waiting on diablo 4, diablo 2 Resurrected, 9.1 in WoW
[5:47:05] Aravarth: it's 2021, if ass ain't bein' eaten, people ain't doing it right

[5:48:45] leogaming83: i think that tbc is launching in the next 3 or 4 months ?
[5:48:47] BlueBeast33: I gotta level both a blood elf and a draenei in pre patch
[5:48:50] QQisLIVE: And limited to only 1
[5:48:51] gramark: any info about valor in 9.1 ?
[5:48:52] Zippaya: do you think they will finish with TBC, or we are gonna play BFA legacy 15 years from now :D
[5:48:56] DreamWebb: TBC launch isnt going to be as impactfull as classic alot of people got their nostaglia hit already
[5:49:10] leogaming83: 2 months nice
[5:49:12] luckfore: 9.1 is 3-4
[5:49:26] mmrghost7: 9.1 in in 1 week booom
[5:49:31] mmrghost7: is *
[5:49:40] BRUTALIT0PS: See, I think the opposite @DreamWebb Most people's favorite expansion is BC. I think it's going to be super hyped.
[5:49:40] DrakhanGaming: The main reason i wont play tbc is because it will eventually die off and then all time sink was a waste
[5:49:47] leogaming83: im just finding lvling to 60 hard :(
[5:49:47] QQisLIVE: @BRUTALIT0PS I agree.
[5:50:02] pavepawns: 9.1 is right this second
[5:50:29] QQisLIVE: @leogaming83 Thats cause Vanilla leveling is its own beast lol
[5:50:33] k1ngwalrus: What is 9.1 live ?
[5:50:34] mmrghost7: 9.1 was 10 yrs ago
[5:50:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:50:41] DrakhanGaming: but there wont be a new patch in tbc, its all been done already, atleast retail you keep all those mounts, pets, achievements and your character develops
[5:50:50] josh8555: just gotta quest lol
[5:51:12] QQisLIVE: My suggestion for leveling, take it easy and just try to be consistent. Once Pre-patch drops it takes less time.
[5:51:19] duncon: 9.2 Summer of 2022 at this rate.
[5:51:26] dukazii: doesnt it take like 5 hrs to get to 60
[5:51:27] NovaSun84: the guild in Azuresong is popping too, always people on to talk to

[5:51:39] BRUTALIT0PS: ^^ Darn tootin
[5:51:48] KythosMeltdown: Why not level in pre patch? Leveling speed is reduced a lot and more quests right?
[5:51:50] Steppie: Not getting out of bed today, I’ll eventually die off and then all time sink was a waste
[5:51:51] Kromede: nukular gear POGGERS
[5:51:53] BRUTALIT0PS: The guild is full of people willing to help each other level
[5:52:04] DreamWebb: the character copy is 5head they are going to make so much fkn money

[5:52:15] hotstreek: some turbogamers will prob find i way to do it in a few hours
[5:52:18] CROVEK: 5 hours from 50 to 60
[5:52:47] BlueBeast33: yeah it's around 3 days of played time

[5:53:04] Kromede: gesundheit
[5:53:37] BRUTALIT0PS: 100%
[5:53:44] BRUTALIT0PS: So much back and forth
[5:53:47] Saephon: constantly going back and forth across azeroth for the same chains
[5:53:54] BlueBeast33: 1-40 is a ton of running back and forth
[5:53:55] maccaruso: Classic has way TOO much travelling
[5:54:08] peinen: They definitely wanted to show off the world they created back in the day
[5:54:10] tkzod: in TBC you already start with a ground mount
[5:54:28] warrenny: But but WORLD of warcraft Kappa
[5:54:29] josh8555: yea quest density is much better
[5:54:30] duncon: BC leveling was fun imo
[5:54:34] DrakhanGaming: yeah but you could do all that in retail
[5:54:42] maccaruso: @tkzod a 100% mount at that for most
[5:54:44] QQisLIVE: The experience in Classic is very progressive. When you get a mount, it's extremely rewarding lol
[5:54:44] Balkidar: Yea, I can only remember one Nethergarde keep quest
[5:54:46] Saephon: I'm leveling my first char to 60 and I do appreciate the world tour :D it's fun going all over, but I would not want to do this again on an alt
[5:55:10] thiccsushi: I'll just boost a character LULW
[5:55:13] maccaruso: Classic leveling is way too high a hurdle for a lot of people
[5:55:22] MuttonChopins: now 1-60 is faster or just boost
[5:55:26] beauds69: 170 hours or 1 hour of work I'll take the hour of work
[5:55:31] DreamWebb: then dont play classic? LUL
[5:55:34] duncon: That's like 5 clears of TC :D
[5:56:09] Shineey: also more stream-lined instead of going across continents just for a quest
[5:56:24] DrakhanGaming: I just hate the fact the account will just sit there once the last raid is out and done and it will just rot while retail is constantly getting new content

[6:07:49] DrakhanGaming: I would never take TRT, id rather live a few more years
[6:07:53] Aravarth: @danimoto10 Low T can contribute to higher prostate cancer risks, but you can mitigate this by jerking off like once a day. No joke, dead serious.

[6:09:17] DamnJester: is lula prepared for the trt?
[6:09:18] DrakhanGaming: I would rather have low T than taking TRT
[6:09:28] notadoctear: @Towelliee Im a behavioral endocrinologist. The most important thing to consider with TRT is constant communication with your physician, and monitoring of your levels regularly . If an endocrinologist is working with you.you should be fine. It is likely you won't even realize how bad you were before you got it!
[6:09:50] XarkoLP: more energy means more streams? Kappa

[6:11:38] DrakhanGaming: But have you really tried to do everything you can naturally to raise your testosterone?
[6:11:39] azooooooma: cream on balls like lube for jerky jerky?
[6:11:46] Broomba: cream on balls nice lubricant
[6:12:21] DrakhanGaming: I feel like with a solid clean meal plan, working out every day, minimizing stress around you would be way better than takin a drug to enhance your performance
[6:12:31] Broomba: you dont have to think about applying T -- it does for you

[6:13:10] nocontextlive: @DrakhanGaming but still wont change t levels
[6:13:30] Shadowlemur01: tru
[6:13:30] Peterbant: TRT is not a performance enhancer. It's fixing a problem with your body.
[6:13:37] DrakhanGaming: Did you stop drinking those 4 years?
[6:14:03] Armdel: "chest workouts to reduce chest fat" tells you how much they know
[6:14:11] maccaruso: Yeah man-boobs are genetic.  My brother had the surgery as well
[6:14:11] Alchin0: I can grow a beard but i have gyno, but i dont mind it cause im Fit. My nipples only look normal hard
[6:14:11] Alienfromger: dont forget psycho influence on hormones
[6:14:26] Shadowlemur01: drinking lowers T? Jesus the whole military is fucked then I guess
[6:14:27] brarker: go keto and u good :D
[6:14:32] MikeyA1256: do you think the addition of M+ score and +20 achievements can open up valor gearing to a mythic raid level?
[6:14:46] smashwow: TRT can fix a lot of things. there's other chems that your body produces that can negate TRT though so typically you'll want a blood screen to monitor that.
[6:14:59] NovaSun84: Towelliee every stream: "yes I have eaten a shitload of broccolli" LULW

[6:19:12] DrakhanGaming: People discredit using the internet for information and thats why humans will never evolve, we have almost all the information in the world at our disposal and people use it to dance on tiktok and send dick pics
[6:19:26] NovaSun84: which HM version of chair?
[6:19:30] smashwow: do any of the herman miller's recline like the secret labs?
[6:19:34] NovaSun84: The "gamer" one looks kinda neat from them
[6:20:13] chrslp: Herman Millar is actually ergonomic. Secret labs is...not really
[6:20:16] Seerated: Gaming brands isn't comparable to an Miller, to different worlds
[6:20:20] NovaSun84: I have a SL type chair, and after 6 hours my back is killing me
[6:20:24] Seerated: two*
[6:20:33] smashwow: only reason i ask is i do like the recline option of a SL or DXR chair. but i'm looking to upgrade
[6:20:40] BRUTALIT0PS: I have some cheap brand we found on Amazon three years ago and they're still going strong.
[6:20:41] DrakhanGaming: I think shaq has his own brand of chairs now lol

[6:21:41] theDirtyon3: marketing
[6:21:44] YardRage: Shaq got that general "F you" money now
[6:21:45] Ldysansa: He has to he so tall
[6:21:48] Sephiroht: steelcase and herman miller are high quality chairs that are VERY ergonomic and well worth the price, if you can swing it
[6:21:49] Armdel: "gamer" chairs are just normal chairs with fancy colors and a bigger price tag
[6:21:54] chrslp: @lieutenantdan416 Its a marketing thing. Cheap non-ergonomic chairs that look fancy
[6:21:58] Ldysansa: If he doesn't make it it wouldn't fit him lolo
[6:22:00] xXSiebzehnXx: My parent’s do the furniture for Patel Reddy and City of Hope, they only use Herman Miller
[6:22:01] thecynicalshuffler: when i left my call center job i thought about sneaking the HM chair i had out with me... lol
[6:22:07] NovaSun84: Gamer chairs, are just rebranded "racing chairs"  They look and feel like carseats
[6:22:12] lieutenantdan416: @chrslp gotcha
[6:22:13] smashwow: and he's a sheriff or something like that. dude be hustling
[6:22:16] jaacobjames: You doing any more keys today boss?
[6:22:23] DrakhanGaming: isnt the best ergonomic just to stand and play and not sit
[6:22:34] mikyki: Secret lab is trash
[6:22:37] chrslp: You're better off buying a $500 office chair than a $500 "gaming" chair
