[1:45:09] FlexFalkon: Is it sod or hardcore
[1:45:47] nitrosmob: I remember having a roommate in college who played so much WoW they failed that semester
[1:46:14] vogairian: It definitely didn't help a few of my grades.
[1:46:47] blurst_: i failed the old fashioned way
[1:46:52] blurst_: too much party
[1:46:59] nitrosmob: I played for like a month or two. I think since I did MUDs ages ago it wasn't as appealing to me in a way.
[1:47:05] Clickums: @blurst_ why not both?
[1:47:09] blurst_: friend of mine failed from wow though
[1:47:16] Clickums: That's why I'm not an engineer KEKW
[1:47:30] vogairian: I did have a buddy flunk out when he attempted to become a Starcraft 2 pro. He did not make it. Now he's a biologist or something lame like that.
[1:47:31] nitrosmob: I failed a few classes too...cause of good old depression
[1:47:57] the_kooyea: @blurst_ same, except Everquest
[1:48:06] nitrosmob: also didn't help my roommate was pretty depressed at the time too. did get my act together though and a bit of help
[1:48:11] Deusis: female tauren NOT named Milktank... I hope it was taken
[1:48:17] nitrosmob: I had some hunter
[1:48:18] Deusis: warrior on top of that
[1:48:28] blurst_: @the_kooyea holy bboomer
[1:48:52] blurst_: i played eq but i was just a kid and had no idea what i was doing
[1:48:59] blurst_: still had fun
[1:49:04] the_kooyea: I never played it because of that fact
[1:49:31] the_kooyea: a different friend was was way into WoW early, ended up getting a few jobs because of it
[1:49:42] the_kooyea: but I feel like he's 1/10000069420
[1:50:06] tentakelmonster: well I never got a job because of wow
[1:50:09] nitrosmob: it seems like that for many things..you get in early and popular and you can make a living
[1:50:09] Deusis: didn't some massive guild leader get like a CEO position at    Yahoo and he had his WoW stuff on his resume
[1:50:11] blurst_: I've heard stories of guild masters becoming managers due to wow
[1:50:13] tentakelmonster: so that checks out
[1:50:18] blurst_: but yeah has to be extremeely rare
[1:50:49] blurst_: probably more like this experienced manager was also a guild leader
[1:50:56] blurst_: and not the other way around
[1:51:12] Deusis: No I remember reading he put in detail all his guild management duties
[1:51:36] nitrosmob: "micro manage everything"....you're perfect for the CEO!
[1:51:46] Deusis: coordinating 40 ppl multiple times a week, managing officers, class leaders, etc.
[1:52:25] nitrosmob: I'm tired of LCI and wish we didn't get cube and just went to the next set sooner haha ;)
[1:52:29] TehGrimmace: NumotTheNappy
[1:52:47] azver_jones: Man, I've been clean 19 years. What am I doing here.
[1:52:54] vogairian: @azver_jones That's what I said earlier!
[1:53:08] azver_jones: @vogairian I got the game patched in 1.4
[1:53:10] nanobots_: What server is this?
[1:53:16] Deusis: tempting but FFXIV 7.0 drops this summer...
[1:53:16] jessicatheblack: What server?
[1:53:17] n3ther: join... us...
[1:53:17] coltlocs: My fav raid was either SSC or Ulduar haha
[1:53:17] macdaddyhaus: You guys remember that pic of people playing games and the one dude is ductaped to the ceiling?
[1:53:23] n3ther: he said innocently
[1:53:23] nitrosmob: you are making me want to play kaizo again
[1:53:27] nitrosmob: I've been clean a year already!
[1:53:33] azver_jones: Someone tell me what server
[1:53:38] sponkmonkey: @macdaddyhaus hell yeah
[1:53:46] TehGrimmace: Sunwell was so much fun at the time
[1:53:47] vogairian: @azver_jones Dang! I'm only out for a few years, but still.
[1:53:53] macdaddyhaus: That's how I always imagine it has to be to get more than 5 people to meet up for a raid 😂
[1:54:03] azver_jones: @vogairian did you play way early on?
[1:54:09] nitrosmob: sometimes I wonder if my old MUD I went to when I was in high school is still around lol
[1:54:13] nitrosmob: it probably is
[1:54:14] Deusis: I was on Alleria in vanilla. We almost had a few world firsts. The top guild on the server did get a few
[1:54:29] azver_jones: @nitrosmob I will definitely start a MUDot the MUDDY
[1:54:48] nitrosmob: the one good thing about mudding was I learned early script writing haha
[1:54:56] nitrosmob: I automated my character to farm lol
[1:55:06] vogairian: @azver_jones Yea. From actual classic.
[1:55:48] azver_jones: @vogairian So there was an exploit that people didn't really notice because it was in the fury tree when fury was "bad" (read: unplayable) and we only had one 40 man raid.
[1:56:21] nitrosmob: nummy opening precious flowers numotMMM numotMMM numotMMM
[1:56:40] Dupue: wow is just as bad as LCI
[1:56:44] azver_jones: @azver_jones If you were dual wielding and didn't have a weapon equipped your offhand would do the same base dammage as your weapon with an attack speed off 1. So if you could find an incredibly slow offhand weapon suddenly your DPS was insane.

[2:12:26] sponkmonkey: ResidentSleeper
[2:12:34] TradewindFTW: I hope they give Tank Shaman a rune to wear plate in P2.  Having 2 plates on ally and 1 on horde makes the loot tables weird for raids.

[2:15:56] tyneetym: @TradewindFTW I agree, would be nice if both side just had all the classes, to start.. Classic + can mean Paladins and Shamans on both sides
[2:16:07] tyneetym: I am sure they have the technbology
[2:16:54] TradewindFTW: @tyneetym hmm, that may be a solution too.  Intro pally and shaman on both factions without the dranei and blood elf starting area?

[2:21:55] sponkmonkey: @nitrosmob I kind of lost interest in new games over the past year. Idk if I even played anything new other than Armored Core 6. I want to play Dragon's Dogma 2 but not enough to get a new PC/console for it
[2:22:03] dragonknite87: Only Horde or do you have a alliance server as well?
[2:22:17] dragonknite87: *guild
[2:22:31] eesoteric: just rolled a tauren warrior on living flame, haven't played a warrior before :D

[2:28:10] TheStormlightArchivist: I think they turn off character creation to force balance
[2:28:12] Trahas: so if there are too many horde they force you to make alliance
[2:28:13] TheStormlightArchivist: im not sure tho
[2:28:22] TheStormlightArchivist: per faction
[2:28:26] nanobots_: Only lets me create alliance toons
