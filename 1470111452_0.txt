[0:19:42] Dagomarus: üçñ Hams up bois üçñ
[0:20:20] Collected1: i want my undead paladin
[0:20:41] Thoreya: draenei rogues gonna be weird
[0:20:41] Armdel: @captiv8 gives people time to see that the stream is live and get on without missing the start i guess? most streamers only do it for 10-15 minutes though
[0:20:43] Thoreya: and orc priests
[0:20:46] Collected1: GLORIA
[0:21:04] onybear: @Collected1 oooo undead paladin..that would be cool

[0:23:20] DragonofWolves: ok that moobot command needs to go.
[0:23:27] Collected1: what I want to know is when is Daddy getting his interview
[0:23:38] Collected1: we need the hammers represented
[0:24:01] Armdel: he said yesterday he didn't wanna to an interview before alpha was out
[0:24:22] Collected1: ahh fair enough
[0:24:33] Speedglass: boupheShrug
[0:24:38] Collected1: dem alpha keys doe
[0:24:40] Armdel: think he was offered the chance, but asked to do it later?
[0:25:23] FrankTizzle: @Armdel probably smarter play; everyone that has done an interview are doing repeat questions now; waiting until alpha means you have new things to ask or if they will change certain things on alpha
[0:25:54] FrankTizzle: Holinka did confirm that Gladiator Stance is NOT returning
[0:25:55] DragonofWolves: you know the only bad thing about WoTLK classic coming out is that you'll have to deal with that annoying ass dragon roar lol. I remember not many were fond of that
[0:25:59] FrankTizzle: FeelsBadMan Time to quit wow forever
[0:26:23] Thoreya: meh glad stance would be weird rn
[0:27:13] Scraggersmeh: @DragonofWolves Really? I never met anyone who disliked it.
[0:28:27] DragonofWolves: @scraggersmeh what I mean is the dragon roar was louder than the actual music.
[0:29:09] Thoreya: sooo we want mop classic after wrath is done right? no cata

[0:29:45] Armdel: personally i wouldn't mind the chance of doing the first 2 tiers of cata raids
[0:29:56] Armdel: i only did dragon soul back in teh day
[0:30:00] DragonofWolves: wouldn't make sense because new talent trees were still in MoP
[0:30:25] Thoreya: im just saying moreso bc cata was garbo imo lol
[0:30:28] Crowargus: 1st tier of cata was awesome
[0:30:31] Thoreya: so wouldnt mind skipping to pandaland
[0:30:49] DragonofWolves: like classic to me is vanilla, TBC and WoTLK
[0:31:15] FrankTizzle: Here's my Bold Tank: MoP and Legion were only good because the previous expansions were not as good
[0:31:15] DragonofWolves: aka peak WoW
[0:31:45] Thoreya: i never played mop. cata made me quit for like 7 years so i wanna play that expansion very bad

[0:39:59] HypnosTheHero: Hey chat , if I wanted to start WoW‚Ä¶Is there something‚Äôs I should know like what server to go on etc or does none of that really matter.
[0:40:39] Crowargus: id personally go for high pop server
[0:41:04] HypnosTheHero: Is there a website to see?
[0:41:28] HypnosTheHero: Because I‚Äôve only been able to find one for classic and TBC
[0:41:38] Armdel: pretty sure there are a few websites for server pop and faction balance
[0:41:42] Thoreya: id go high server
[0:41:45] Crowargus: can s√® when you make a character shows realm list n how full they are
[0:41:46] TeejayOCE: WoWprogress is a good place to check
[0:41:56] mcloveinu716: master loot yall ?? what u all think??
[0:41:58] Armdel: and ye, i would pick a higher pop server that favors the faction you wanna play
[0:42:02] Thoreya: and ho horde
[0:42:05] Thoreya: go
[0:42:06] HypnosTheHero: Also is faction balance something I should look for or does that not matter?
[0:42:33] Thoreya: uhhh
[0:42:36] TeejayOCE: Horde has more but it doesn't matter a whole lot
[0:42:44] Thoreya: id say go horde on a high pop horde serber
[0:42:44] Crowargus: might not be a thing next patch but horde is most popular
[0:42:46] Thoreya: server
[0:42:57] Thoreya: 9.2.5 is allowing cross faction but
[0:43:10] Just_Jack13: Horde 100% the play if you want a big community now. But 9.2.5 will have cross faction stuff if you really want to be alliance
[0:43:10] Armdel: @HypnosTheHero depends mostly on if you wanna find a guild or not i guess?
[0:43:32] niebvelungen: !start
[0:43:37] HypnosTheHero: I prefer to play with others yes lol
[0:43:43] Sollice: @niebvelungen no
[0:43:56] TeejayOCE: If you wanna play alliance come to Oce Frostmourne server, literally all alliance lol
[0:43:59] Asyia3: !thoon

[0:44:00] Armdel: but ye i would find a large server with a faction balance that favor the faction you want to play
[0:44:03] Thoreya: go horde on illidan, tichondrius, zuljin, thrall
[0:44:08] niebvelungen: @niebvelungen D:
[0:44:08] Thoreya: area 52
[0:44:13] Thoreya: all those are big horde servers
[0:44:26] VerdeSol3: Is he a video game character?
[0:44:37] ahies28: !soon

[0:45:12] HypnosTheHero: Okay I‚Äôll give that a try @thoreya thank you
[0:45:23] Thoreya: welcome!
[0:45:33] Rhikre: Is his waiting room usually this long?
[0:45:45] Thoreya: also AH prices for stuff are lower on high servers so thats also a positive compared to low pop servers
[0:45:47] HypnosTheHero: One more question‚Ä¶are the classes balanced? Can I play any class or not really lol
[0:45:57] bharjes1: @Rhikre yep
[0:45:59] Thoreya: yeah theyre fine for the most part
[0:46:06] lucid_wow: @HypnosTheHero more or less yeah
[0:46:20] Thoreya: some specs are outliers but thats expected
[0:46:59] HypnosTheHero: Was thinking maybe DK or Warrior
[0:47:13] HypnosTheHero: Possibly Paladin
[0:47:15] Sheckly84: class balance changes all the time, but usually most specs are playable at the highest levels. (everything is playable in general gameplay)

[0:54:36] Hypertitan: i agree....I enjoy the basic addons myself...was just interesting to hear the take on the combat addons
[0:54:41] annokev: @larualis Same
[0:54:46] bypized: Zero addons, I dont think so, but limiting combat addons I think its ok
[0:54:46] Alienfromger: wow mobile with addons?
[0:54:51] xraynibba: to be fair the addons really really dumb teh game down tho
[0:54:57] Hypertitan: I use the fuck out of addons myself haha
[0:55:02] NEMERL: They just need to disable the API for that structures and add their own
[0:55:33] lilwaldo: I think they want to try people go away on having 20+ addons and have like 5-10 addons maybe, but they said they will not prevent on you keeping the current addons.
[0:55:34] alextheory_: crazy weakaura for that race for sure
[0:55:36] aznamir: Modern raid encounters are too complex at the moment, specifically because of all the different addons people use.
[0:55:37] Hypertitan: timers and make ui pretty things for me is all
[0:55:40] Mistery836: I don't mind addons. I would just like to see that I don't need them LUL

[0:56:20] Collected1: who was exec producer prior to Holly?
[0:56:21] grapyz: Imo the problem with addons is when it fixes a puzzle which would require team work as a qguild
[0:56:25] Hypertitan: MOST addons make UI's more intuitive for people is all
[0:56:25] Cristiex2012: Cristiex2012 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[0:56:44] simonbgg: Is there really alot of people saying no Addons? The big issue is really Weakauras that solve the fights/does the mechanics for you.
[0:56:50] Alepouditsa: i used add on only for battle pets
[0:56:52] griffdog125: imagine healing with no healing addons lol
[0:56:58] aznamir: Remember how people cried about the removal of the range check and positional addons and the sky did not fall. Blizz did add warning zones, etc
[0:57:11] AntonioFF: Good morning
[0:57:12] Just_Jack13: @ asmon ? lol
[0:57:18] annokev: Turn your addons off and go do any endgame and its rough being so dependent on them. Will like you say adapt over time tho
[0:57:23] Clockwerk_Industries: Clockwerk_Industries subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:57:33] niebvelungen: i am healing with no healing addons
[0:57:41] TDTPrem: Just gotta make mouseover macros
[0:57:41] holyrs: mouse over macros
[0:57:43] holyrs: >_>
[0:57:44] niebvelungen: doing +15 +16 just fine
[0:57:49] Mistery836: you don't need an addon to not have to click people though. mouseover macros are for that
[0:57:50] simonbgg: WeakAuras that kinda is required now adays are the big issues, not the addons themselfs.
[0:58:02] Clockwerk_Industries: Your stream got me back in the game! Keep killing it!
[0:58:06] Sagitarium: 15 is endgame? :P
[0:58:07] akia03: @Towelliee you done the weekly already?
[0:58:10] niebvelungen: i dont even use mouse over i just click fast lul
[0:58:14] captiv8: we 100 percent depend on them bud
[0:58:22] annokev: How many times in raids have you heard on ready check "Gimme a min to sort a Weak Aura"
[0:58:25] Collected1: Ion's "me too" comment in relation to having more hair in that asmongold photo was hilarious
[0:58:27] inj0shwetrust: you ever get the warbringer mount?  Ive been at sea on and off  since January
[0:58:28] plebstertv: yeah addons just make quality of life better in game
[0:58:44] Hypertitan: the clarity of ingame information in the base UI is lacking
[0:58:58] azzurrin: playing too much FFXIV
[0:59:04] minael1: i hated addons from second 1 i was forced to download them.
[0:59:06] schneid4: you cant blame players for using them when blizzard makes them neccessary for progression
[0:59:07] Sagitarium: its becouse of games like LOST ARK that have no wa's
[0:59:08] aznamir: YES! Develop raids as if addons do not exist and as if players have no help from such addons. Make raids simplier and less mechanis.
[0:59:12] VerdeSol3: come back to the real game?
[0:59:12] xraynibba: tru
[0:59:13] annokev: Makes sense
[0:59:14] FrankTizzle: true
[0:59:16] captiv8: i smell a hater
[0:59:20] TacDuc: @niebvelungen Just use UI addons, other than that it's macros
[0:59:20] ThreeBeeps: computational addons that tell you what to do literally ruin the game
[0:59:21] holyrs: yes but addons have gone a bit too far i think
[0:59:34] headshot_hunter6: they could always just integrate the addons into the base game, like the code is there they just have to approach the creators and be like heres some money give us your code
[0:59:34] zysmos: yea right
[0:59:35] NeozinGG: what's your hopes for Dragonflight?
[0:59:52] simonbgg: Thats not what is being said tho, right? Addons are not the issues, but weakauras that actually solves fights and almost does mechanics for you. So thats abit wierd to say.
[0:59:54] FrankTizzle: Yea, it would be bigger than removing flying imo
[0:59:55] xraynibba: tru
[0:59:55] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I mean those people making addons give their sweat and blood to make them initially, Blizzard jjust doesnt want to drop that
[0:59:56] niebvelungen: @niebvelungen just good ui and you dont even need macros
[0:59:58] Gluwc: depending on what addons i'd stop playing tbh
[0:59:58] bypized: Well, I do think that Addons today are a big reason of why new players drop the game. I have friends that didnt want to move forward to end game, because I showed them, look this is what we gotta do to be able to complete keys
[0:59:59] annokev: For how long tho?
[1:00:00] Collected1: i didn't get any sense they're even considering that
[1:00:04] minael1: yes. cause its hard to think by yourself. agreed
[1:00:04] Akoudadis: You would have to make it much much easier too
[1:00:06] zysmos: it's like when valorant came out and all cs players were complaining some aspects of it were not similar enough to counter strike like bro it's not the same game
[1:00:15] dimofodi: I wouldn't mind having a little less but like Ion said, it would break the cosmetic stuff in trying to do so like ElvUI etc.
[1:00:19] ThreeBeeps: they wont remove addons, only computational addons like weakauras and such. they absolutely ruin the game. blizz designs fights around 3rd party addons right now
[1:00:26] Hypertitan: I think some of the things WA's are doing is pushing it...but I also think that maybe the top 1% of players actually use that functionality
[1:00:31] ultimaflarestar: it's not that add-ons should be removed it's that blizzard shouldn't design the game half done and expect add-on makers to fix everything for them
[1:00:43] bypized: I think that weakauras is too much
[1:00:47] ar_melol: @Towelliee im basically doing what ur doing lol
[1:00:54] lilwaldo: @Towelliee You think engineering is going to be more relevant in 10.0 with the profession overhaul?
[1:01:06] bypized: New Player Experience from Blizzard = Here download this list of addons
[1:01:19] Gluwc: thing is you can't just remove WA, you'd be crippling a massive part of the API
[1:01:23] DuploThief: you need more than 40 renown to go to korthia
[1:01:35] dimofodi: Certai n WA are too much, the basic countdowns/timers and cosmetic is just fine.
[1:01:42] ar_melol: @DuploThief no
[1:01:52] lilwaldo: I mostly use weakauras to keep eyes on buffs, cooldowns, and stacks.
[1:01:56] TacDuc: I use weakaura's for my cooldowns like the one towelliee has instead of looking at my messy action bar

[1:02:13] niebvelungen: anti addon andys malding
[1:02:17] aznamir: Just design raids that do not require any addons.
[1:02:18] ThreeBeeps: such a bad take dude. no one is saying remove ALL addons
[1:02:20] DuploThief: @Cazapx korthia campaign unlocks with renown
[1:02:21] OtherguyTTV: @towelliee what DO you think about removing all! addons for raiding?
[1:02:23] alextheory_: so you mean hearth is not flat? yikkes Kappa
[1:02:25] Hypertitan: the crazy stuff you can do with WA's I honestly believe is used by a very small % of players....I think WA's is largely used as a UI addons
[1:02:27] Shamwise: Earth isnt flat, its more like a disc:)
[1:02:29] Collected1: if addons become the next "rip cord", I'm out
[1:02:32] FrankTizzle: Is it?
[1:02:32] Libbzy: Those people would be the first to complain about the lack of content
[1:02:44] FrankTizzle: What do you use from engineering for M+? Just the battle res?
[1:02:48] inj0shwetrust: B Res and Wormhole make it worth alone
[1:02:55] headshot_hunter6: imagine being able to sell engineering battle res item in the ah, thats basically what were going to be able to do right
[1:03:17] inj0shwetrust: not to mention for us non long boy owners auction house in Oribos
[1:03:17] lilwaldo: Just thinking about AVR makes me cringe.
[1:03:19] bypized: @Towelliee but dont you think that they can be observing the new people that need to come to WoW? I mean, I am not going to live forever, Blizzard is probably also thinking towards the young players that are coming from other games and are not used to having to download an outside software, lookup a youtube video and download a list, setup and get gud at the game
[1:03:20] Mibd2010: good morning
[1:03:23] Mallaes: SMOrc
[1:03:37] Broomba: @towelliee will you unlock flying in SL on this character?
[1:03:55] Broomba: wtf?
[1:03:59] niebvelungen: big true
[1:04:01] xXSiebzehnXx: Ahhh the resurgence of Chadbomb. Good morning @towelliee towHAMUP towLets towGo
[1:04:11] Hypertitan: gamers now are smarter about that kind of shit than us boomers were
[1:04:16] Qargory: can confirm, the young guys ive come across, will look for every addon possible lmao
[1:04:20] bouda118: Younger generation are lazy they want all the ease
[1:04:43] spizzoo: spizzoo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[1:04:45] PhillyDilly18: Is there a metric somewhere that shows how the player population is split between brand new people and veteran players? I have always believed a majority of players are veterans.
[1:04:50] bypized: Thinking that the younger generation will do all of that in volume? They wont, they are lazy
[1:05:03] alextheory_: i feel its way smarter that way, why make it harder for no actual reason?
[1:05:03] bypized: They are looking for accessibility, ease to jump in
[1:05:07] bypized: Out of the box experience
[1:05:18] TacDuc: I like having a good looking UI, so I just embrace that
[1:05:22] Gluwc: I'm going to be controversial here... I wish more games had addons ;)
[1:05:24] gold9871: still use pitbull very easy to setup
[1:05:25] Hypertitan: same..my first addon was xperl ...I was that guy with way too many addons on my screen haha
[1:05:26] OreiChi: Im one of those old timers @_@;
[1:05:27] Zettabyte: You used Ony as a raidframe?? Kappa
[1:05:33] DeanoTV: Alot of people have their own UI and stuff now, alot of them would quit if they removed addons
[1:05:37] ultimaflarestar: New players see the list of things they need to set up to get a proper start and there is a good chance they'll just play something else and not bother
[1:05:40] bypized: They will
[1:05:55] Qargory: lmao duno how old some people are here, but your prejudice is showing
[1:05:58] pigzip: @towelliee Why do the people who don‚Äôt want addons just turn them off and not play with them   Problem solved
[1:05:59] norrathtv: man i just  used 2 weeks teaching a young player this game and shitt it was so much info to teach and go trought and im not doing that again and i wish new player good luck on this
[1:05:59] jhopps12: I did like when Ion said he wants addons to be informational but not do the computing.
[1:06:03] Armdel: pretty much every competitive online game has guides and info on the internet
[1:06:08] dyslexican1: Yeah its 100% the old timers that are really anti addons. the only people who complain about them is the boomers in my guild.
[1:06:09] bypized: And then they will make a choice, do I stick with the game or do I download this bunch of crap?
[1:06:09] OreiChi: thought add on were so cheap in pvp back in the days
[1:06:13] RocketMan23: people pretend like addons are this crazy complicated thing, they are literally the press of a button to install
[1:06:14] lilwaldo: As they see the word "Addon" They will go everywhere to see how the can make top notch layout.
[1:06:14] PraxicThorn: @pigzip that's not the point
[1:06:24] alextheory_: @Qargory yeah, talking about how young people are lazy, boomer take
[1:06:36] Qargory: @Qargory 100%
[1:06:46] bypized: @Qargory Dude, Im talking on a greater scale
[1:06:47] Scoodles91: yes you do
[1:06:48] gold9871: anima gear yes
[1:06:50] bypized: In order to have volume
[1:06:52] emznev: ye
[1:07:01] mewkittymon: Yes
[1:07:02] assman_ny: Yep @Towelliee gear
[1:07:08] Qargory: calling younger people lazy is a boomer take lmao
[1:07:14] Broomba: how dont know how this addon became a issue regarding the new expansion.... i am baffled
[1:07:20] OreiChi: I never minded addon for pve but even now I still don't like addons in pvp
[1:07:20] J_Rich94: @Qargory lol i mean there are A LOT of young ppl that are RLY lazy
[1:07:38] eshonxv: ppl realise this game has been built around add-ons since the 2003 alpha lol? it blows my mind ppl think mods should be banned, the people saying mods should be banned don't even raid and barely play the game, it's always dad boomers and super casuals whining about it because they can't be bothered setting up addons/mods themselves, the purpose of add-ons is to free up developer time AND allow people to customise the game personally how they want
[1:07:45] VerdeSol3: FHB
[1:07:47] TacDuc: Depends on the people, but yeah a lot of younger people are more "competitive" in my experience.
[1:07:52] Broomba: wow isnt fortnight
[1:07:54] Lilmistwuble: old ass peeps towCringe
[1:07:58] dyslexican1: I don't get what the issue is. Look if you don;t want addons just DON'T USE THEM. Its fine! Let the rest of us use them cus we like them.
[1:08:04] bypized: I am 26
[1:08:07] TacDuc: You get all of that by completing the campaign
[1:08:16] DeanoTV: Maw POGGERS
[1:08:17] Thoreya: i can see weak auras being gone in raid
[1:08:19] Thoreya: but not addons
[1:08:20] jhopps12: @eshonxv I like addons but I'm NOT trying to "free up developer time" lol.
[1:08:32] Kaype92: @towelliee just a heads up, you want as little as mastery in endgame as possible. Literally zero mastery of you possibly can. When I say it‚Äôs our worst stat it‚Äôs really that bad. Especially when you get set bonus since it does absolutely nothing to our bomb damage
[1:08:33] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || THE GRIND DOESN'T STOP!! - WoW 9 to 5 Challenge: Episode 2 youtu.be/j8DEMGf_hTc
[1:08:38] bypized: All I am saying is from having to teach friends of mine what they need to do in order to be competitive in the game
[1:08:49] Armdel: yeah but addons are like, a third party thing...
[1:08:58] griffdog125: lol why bitch about them, you can turn them off if you dont want them or just don't download them
[1:09:07] Bl4ckSauce: Any interviews happening today ?
[1:09:12] Broomba: i used 2 addons back in the original TBC -- quest helper and one for the maps
[1:09:14] dyslexican1: We could go back to the dark ages and go back to look every single everything on "alakazam" again.
[1:09:15] Skrapp: I think its just people dont want their hands to be held with addons.
[1:09:20] Zippaya: when we stop talking about our favorite game being dogshit lately, and start about addons
[1:09:24] eshonxv: @jhopps12 well people like customising mmos for their gameplay, imagine saying skyrim should ban add-ons and mods etc lmao

[1:09:28] Yurian33: isnt that the best? having someone to talk to and enjoy the game with
[1:09:30] eshonxv: yep lol
[1:09:30] DeanoTV: trueeee
[1:09:39] HopeThePriest: @Towelliee  Mind blown concept
[1:09:39] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:09:40] PokerFaceMoose: PokerFaceMoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP lets go chadbomb get that aotc.
[1:09:42] Trawkey: sounds good to me
[1:09:46] HopeThePriest: Degree in common sense
[1:09:47] J_Rich94: i play with no add ons and i have a great time playing this game
[1:09:48] minael1: you can't. unless they make raids solo
[1:09:48] epiczplz: based towel
[1:09:49] Motivess: I think y'all misunderstand, he was asking if they can design the game to be less addon dependent.  Like a boss mechanic be more telegraphed so you don't need an addon to tell you whats going to happen and what to do.
[1:09:50] Thoreya: asmons clan was raging saying to remove everything
[1:09:51] Triist0ne: i mean that kinda defeats the point
[1:09:51] bigoldmeatpie: towelliee, you can't be reasonable on the internet. come on
[1:09:52] eshonxv: best take there
[1:09:52] Thoreya: thats a little wild
[1:09:53] TacDuc: But that's no fun, otherwise how would I get angry at people for using stuff that everyone does
[1:09:54] Kize_Gaming: Player Choice ? veiD
[1:09:54] Qargory: preach it towelliee
[1:09:57] xXSiebzehnXx: Do be people have a misconception that they should just be able to jump into every game and be good at it immediately? Ridiclous
[1:09:57] emznev: why are people even talking about it lool
[1:09:59] hookkz: i think it was just about fighting addons / raid addons
[1:10:08] Broomba: soda doesnt use any to little addons and he is competitive in wow
[1:10:14] PraxicThorn: their argument though is that blizzard designs encounters around addons.  if you turn them off, you're handicapping yourself alot
[1:10:30] HopeThePriest: @Towelliee  The only place i think they should be banned is AWC.
[1:10:37] bypized: Chat thinking that me just not agreeing = to bitching LUL
[1:10:39] SensationalBanana: Plz no... I do not want WoW to be like FFXIV...
[1:10:40] luckfore: KEKW
[1:10:41] xXSiebzehnXx: Zzzzzzz
[1:10:42] captiv8: you don't like azmon do you? lol
[1:10:44] raw_mcc: I‚Äôve also been playing since 2004 I actually believe add-ons take away from your skill and give you a reliance on them
[1:10:44] DannyG757: morning
[1:10:44] bawheid: turning mods isnt an option when blizz design encounter around having mods
[1:10:46] DeanoTV: Imagine if they removed addons and LFR, most the playerbase would quit
[1:10:46] lilwaldo: @Towelliee So people say mods for skyrim and legit changing 100% of the game is perfectly fine, but a discussing of addons for wow stirs everything up. People are funny man.
[1:10:48] emznev: FF is boring
[1:10:54] Slitze: ffxiv sucks
[1:10:55] OreiChi: just pvp add ons bothered me  gladius, cd timers
[1:11:02] SSD511_: FF so bad
[1:11:04] onybear: imagine telling people they can't do something because they, themselves, don't like it...
[1:11:06] emznev: looks like a ps1 game
[1:11:08] ultimaflarestar: I highly doubt anyone talking about add-ons is because they want asmongold to play ffxiv
[1:11:09] c0mmander_starscream: Asmon had a good interview
[1:11:09] propwash80: @Towelliee how do you lvl your alts, do you do the story stuff or the fate thing that u lvl w/ world quest and other stuff?
[1:11:10] Trawkey: Asmon is a cancer to the wow community
[1:11:18] bypized: People really thinking that disagreeing is bitching
[1:11:22] bypized: SMH
[1:11:29] Broomba: i love how toxins from one streams oozes into others streams and chat..... uggggghhhh
[1:11:30] IggiePuff: IggiePuff subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 62 months! 
[1:11:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: kinda like saying free speech but stfu Kappa
[1:11:45] SensationalBanana: Only bads want addons removed, let's be real. They think the playing field would be leveled, but great players would still excell.
[1:11:47] freshlife: exactly
[1:11:47] Motivess: @Trawkey no he aint lol, he cares about the game as much as anyone
[1:11:52] freshlife: now keep your free speech to yourself
[1:11:59] c0mmander_starscream: What's with the hate on addons all the sudden?
[1:12:07] SSD511_: I enjoy Star Wars more than FF
[1:12:10] FrankTizzle: D:
[1:12:22] luckfore: blizz listened to the vocal minority with 9.2 and it made ZM boring
[1:12:27] SensationalBanana: @c0mmander_starscream Bads being whiny. Addons are not going anywhere.
[1:12:30] EscapePlan01: @Trawkey wtf? he loves the game? because hes critical of it?
[1:12:32] HaxzorJimDuggan: leave baine in the maw and he comes back a rogue
[1:12:32] TomReforged: KEKW
[1:12:33] Balkep: @lilwaldo skyrim is a single player game so your choices affect only you, addons in an MMO have potential to affect others - for example, auction house and rio
[1:12:34] Dirtnose: @c0mmander_starscream Mostly asmon sheep viewers cause Asmon brought it up a month or so back
[1:12:34] tripl3heart: Bane deserves his own arch in some expansion
[1:12:35] assman_ny: That blows lol
[1:12:38] bypized: @c0mmander_starscream New players experiencing the game or older boomers needing to download a list of addons to be competitive
[1:12:38] lilwaldo: Rip
[1:12:38] Collected1: get running bitch
[1:12:40] Triist0ne: just get 2 chapters in campaign to unlock korthia
[1:12:45] Triist0ne: that gets you mount
[1:12:46] brilargaming: No mount? towLets towGo
[1:12:49] Mordeaur: PepeWhy
[1:12:51] bypized: But careful if you disagree, chat wont be happy
[1:12:52] zaetemira: Why dont you link your main account to this so you have all the achivement etc
[1:12:55] YardRage: no mount in the maw, literally what killed my will to play this expansion LUL
[1:12:56] IggiePuff: towSip
[1:12:57] dimofodi: I think when you get to Korthia skip you'll be able to use your normal mount in Maw.
[1:12:58] ahies28: lol enjoying walking in the maw
[1:13:01] onybear: hopefully there are a ton of outrides in the direction your going
[1:13:02] TacDuc: I think Baine is the true BBEG of WoW, he just plays good, but he is the one keeping Azeroth from waking up, and is slowly draining all her powers, and Magni is just his Pawn.
[1:13:04] raw_mcc: I might be on the bad side of this but I think the future expansion with what they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs going to be a better expansion and I know we always say that every time but they‚Äôre actually opening up to the community and taking interviews
[1:13:05] brewgamingtv: addon's are an optional thing. If u want to use them then use them if u don't then don't. idk why people care what other's use in addons
[1:13:06] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee dude, Baine just sit around in oribos now like a bum. he could just take the portal to orgrimmar and declare himself the warchief LUL
[1:13:09] onybear: *outriders
[1:13:12] Collected1: lets everyone take a moment to appreciate that we won't need to run in 10.0
[1:13:18] Atolanos: Click on the souls after you open cages
[1:13:19] SensationalBanana: @zaetemira Because he's doing a "challenge"
[1:13:26] ItsEddieAU: run forest
[1:13:41] assman_ny: That can make for a rough go
[1:13:43] Atolanos: CLICK THE SOULLLLSSS
[1:13:44] Collected1: @raw_mcc Yeah this time feels a little different but I'm still a tiny bit sceptical. Time will tell.
[1:14:00] maccaruso: You have to .... learn how to train your dragon?
[1:14:01] scarfius: @Towelliee you have to click the souls once they are out of the cage i think
[1:14:10] scridderz: Click the ghosts after the cage
[1:14:11] assman_ny: Gonna be short bursts
[1:14:11] FrankTizzle: Yea, it seems like advanced flight paths at the start
[1:14:18] bypized: Yeah, its not Borrowed Power. Its Borrowed Dragon @Towelliee
[1:14:20] raw_mcc: @collected1 We‚Äôve played for so long in the six pension feels different and I don‚Äôt know why every expansion feels different but this one in particular because they‚Äôre actually listening to people
[1:14:21] Balkep: yeah, it'll probably be more of leaping around rather than full flying
[1:14:22] propwash80: @Towelliee do you lvl your alts through the threads of fate or do you do the replay the story?
[1:14:22] pronkk_: at least the renown system is across all flights
[1:14:23] Skrapp: And it will unlock on Alts, at the start
[1:14:27] duffluv22: @towelliee Gotta click the souls brother Towel
[1:14:34] Atolanos: No after you open cage click the souls
[1:14:36] CritcobainTV: towHAMUP Mornin squad
[1:14:37] raw_mcc: And this expansion ***
[1:14:41] SensationalBanana: @Collected1 Healthy scepticism I'd say. I am sceptical as well until it's proven to be better.
[1:14:45] Collected1: raw_mcc : yup for sure. the game is in a good place right now. especially with who is running things.
[1:14:47] dyslexican1: I don't care what we do with the new xpac so long as its fun. I feel like i have been working a second job to play wow for the last 2 years..
[1:14:49] emznev: @Critcobain sup my man
[1:15:03] PokerFaceMoose: towHAMUP
[1:15:10] propwash80: YO CHAT  whats the better option for alts lvling using threads of fate or replay story?
[1:15:25] LegoCoin: Morning in the Maw LUL - Happy Friday
[1:15:37] raw_mcc: The difference is the renowned system allows you so much different levels of power but this just allows you to explore the world more freely which is a better thing
[1:15:42] duffluv22: Threads
[1:15:49] PokerFaceMoose: threads of fate
[1:16:03] propwash80: ty
[1:16:28] jhopps12: the progression of the renown felt bad, I personally didn't like the 2 renown a week or w/e
[1:16:33] brewgamingtv: well they didn't really say how we would gain xp for dragonriding just yet
[1:16:35] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:16:40] tycranehadem: do you think since Microsoft purchased blizzard , that wow may come to Xbox at some oddly point
[1:16:43] brewgamingtv: or what kind of currency we would have to get for it
[1:16:48] Motivess: Renown is fine if there is no character progression tied to it
[1:17:01] maccaruso: Better work
[1:17:06] LegoCoin: I think with expansion it sounded like were going to more of a Rep system.  Did they say if it would be account based?
[1:17:10] Zettabyte: Dwagon!!
[1:17:21] maccaruso: Have a feeling it will get old in about 3 days
[1:17:23] PvtHudson093: They put the Dragon in Bad Dragon.......

[1:18:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: LEAK
[1:18:08] PvtHudson093: whoops the wow mobile games just leaked
[1:18:13] Mitune: If dragon riding feels anything like GW2s it wont feel old anytime soon
[1:18:22] Collected1: oooooh damn those mobile leaks
[1:18:30] luckfore: later on we'll unlock normal flying tho
[1:18:32] maccaruso: Doesn't mean it can't get old.  Just means you're forced into using it.
[1:18:40] fistofnature: i hope we get something like the bastion mount achivement where you need to collect 40 shards, that was a lot of fun for me 2nd week of the expansion
[1:18:52] swordart2022: @Maccaruso dude if you dont like doing world content like dont do it ? simple as that
[1:19:03] zaetemira: Why dont you link your main account to this so you have all the achivement etc
[1:19:10] swordart2022: do 3 chapters in Korthia and you get mount
[1:19:11] TacDuc: Torghast or some drop from something
[1:19:11] raw_mcc: What people have to understand is everything that has been developed is 2 to 3 years behind what is proposed so even vanilla classic was a test you can‚Äôt just reform a whole game overnight
[1:19:12] PvtHudson093: you have to do Korthia questline
[1:19:18] i_cassius: kill npc for temporary mount
[1:19:18] morp1onz: Korthia campaign lets you ride in the maw
[1:19:20] justagamingfiend: you can kill dogs for a temp mount
[1:19:23] PraxicThorn: @zaetemira he's doing a challenge...that would defeat the point
[1:19:29] Armdel: gotta finish the campaign i guess? otherwise the only mount is from torghast
[1:19:29] Collected1: so Warcraft:GO and a clash game

[1:33:26] Phantomstrk: you know what would be great, a mobile game where you do a pokemon go style game, however, some rare pets, could actually become hunter pets if you capture them, or the mobile game as another way to capture some rarer existing hunter pets
[1:33:31] Broomba: @morp1onz - there are 2 warcraft mobile

[1:37:37] shobolt1980: complete maw quest
[1:37:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think you have to do the covenant campaign before Korthia, the first time
[1:37:39] icerasta: I think its the campaign
[1:37:40] combatant_matt: To unlock korthia, you need to do some Maw quests
[1:37:45] neo_0098: when is diablo immortal going to come out again?

[1:54:28] ArcaneSyntax: that first week of the alpha is gonna a fuckin rollercoaster.
[1:54:35] ItsEddieAU: moobot still talking about leaks and the 24 hourlol
[1:54:50] IianaDRK: after all the interviews and info out so far, im hopeful for dragonflight

[1:54:53] Sylphy_TV: Dragons are always good, what Could possibly go wrong monkaS
[1:54:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: The devs are going to listen to us in beta and we're going to make a great game together, it's truly awesome
[1:54:58] Collected1: i'd like to see something like account wide guilds

[1:56:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: The great prophet and seer!
[1:56:17] Deadcells: I cant wait for new expansion. I just made a frost dk and I can‚Äôt stand that I need to change covenants depending on fight. Such a terrible system imo

[1:57:03] swordart2022: @deadcells firstly that is your choice secondly there will be more talents and options to Change them in Dragonflight,
[1:57:09] Jewishraver: ive been star struck doing some runs with you lol
[1:57:11] Zettabyte: @realtowelliee Kappa
[1:57:19] WhiteKnight74648: I thought i was watching a VTuber Kappa
[1:57:23] swordart2022: @deadcells Malding over self inflicted gameplay
[1:57:23] lawles_walrus: I don't mind borrowed power if they do it right. Legion legendries IMO was done correctly.
[1:57:28] vintersorgSA: lol @WhiteKnight74648
[1:57:28] MarquisLek: but the boss has a new boss
[1:57:30] Shadowlemur01: Mike Ybarra doesnt have much influence?
[1:57:33] FrankTizzle: Ghostcrawler FeelsBadMan
[1:57:40] vintersorgSA: Ybarra too busy selling runs on twitter
[1:57:40] KingSlayerYotam: maybe Ion have less chains now to change stuff
[1:57:41] Sylphy_TV: catJAM
[1:57:44] Coriollis: I belive Mr Ybara (spelling?) changed the communication process
[1:57:52] Sledgecore: Mald draxxus
[1:57:53] sLogOG: did you like the asmongold x ion interview? @Towelliee
[1:57:54] SilkeySmooth: dragonflight is the expansion to make up for shadowlands.
[1:57:56] Deadcells: @fairplay2021 well according to the top frost dks you have to
[1:57:58] Dirtnose: and treasures
[1:57:59] ArcaneSyntax: I think Ion seems happier in the interviews?
[1:58:00] luckfore: the wow classic lead is now also lead for retail
[1:58:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Holinka has been great, and it's good that it's not all on Ion
[1:58:09] CYNIC308: or dungeon
[1:58:15] dyslexican1: I meant our lord and savior Mike Yabarra
[1:58:20] Deadcells: The talent system will be better because you can just save the load outs per the boss and it takes 2 seconds
[1:58:25] luckfore: holly something
[1:58:28] swordart2022: @deadcells do you live by what other say or by what you enjoy
[1:58:30] KingSlayerYotam: Ybera is the messiahs
[1:58:35] reggiepowa: holly is executive producer for wow now
[1:58:37] luckfore: ye

[1:58:42] sesamechickn: i have been playing wow since pre wrath when i was like 13 years old ive been through all the times they said wow was dieing and it is my favorite game and imo the most successful game there has ever been and i will never stop playing it

[1:59:08] assman_ny: I remember her involved in EQ
[1:59:10] ObsidianHealer: Also Liinxy has been doing a great job as a community manager laynaPeek
[1:59:18] sesamechickn: Chris metzen is alwasy blizz to me lol
[1:59:32] Deadcells: @fairplay2021 I just try to output the most damage.
[1:59:33] ArcaneSyntax: @naturalbeef don't discount the amount of people fired in the shakeup
[1:59:42] Collected1: Asmongold and Ion discussing some Wrath healing trinket last night was pretty epic
[1:59:46] Collected1: that guy knows his game
[1:59:50] LurkLimit: Ion is also pretty damn good at raid design
[2:00:01] swordart2022: @deadcells so why upset when you choose to be meta slave
[2:00:15] CYNIC308: Ion was a Scarab Lord he knows this game
[2:00:17] sigilla_: Yabarra was in Mr GM‚Äôs chat during the interview. He got gifted a sub.
[2:00:21] KingSlayerYotam: @Collected1 Ion surprised me as well always seems to know a lot about the game
[2:00:25] vintersorgSA: he should stick with raid design and let someone take over lead, but no one wants it
[2:00:25] raldrik: dont forget gotta kill them in the chime radius
[2:00:29] Coriollis: gamer before businessman , happy times again maybe , who knows, giff a demo/alpha of dragonflight
[2:00:34] Sylphy_TV: Oh man the Suramar music towLove
[2:00:58] ArcaneSyntax: in collaborative industries it's rarely 1 person's fault.
[2:01:03] Collected1: i'm glad he's stuck around. the amount of shit certain areas of the community throw at him is utterly depressing
[2:01:16] pavepawns: how was alpha yesterday?
[2:01:26] vic_ave: @towelliee the borg?
[2:01:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, the forums get crazy

[2:02:05] ArcaneSyntax: I'd go further and say for games in general the wow community is one of the most toxic around.
[2:02:05] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple

[2:02:35] raldrik: gotta kill with the bell down
[2:02:45] Aphro_Samurai: wait did he hit 60 already on chadbomb?
[2:02:54] Deadcells: @fairplay2021 because the way to follow meta now is really annoying. Making leggos constantly draining your gold, changing covenants on the fly are all systems that need to be simplified. In cata the last time I played all I needed to worry about was gear and stats, I miss those days
[2:03:15] Coriollis: how is it toxic to stand up for your/community desires of a better game ?

[2:11:10] RenjiTV: One of my favorite things on Asheron's Call back in the day was when the next "big bad" would show up in major cities and hubs and just start wrecking people. It made the content release feel immersed and made clearing the raid so much more fulfilling
[2:11:17] rsimpson105: Smh streamers ruin another thing OMEGALUL
[2:11:18] Sailboat_of_Doom: This background music is from the NE starting area right?

[2:45:07] rantre208: I just started GW2 after 7 years
[2:45:09] bypized: @funKShun 10fps ok, but 1.8k latency its a bizarre engine server issue
[2:45:09] darssia_: ncsoft literally wants the game to die lol.
[2:45:16] swordart2022: @Sollice sounds Pog
[2:45:24] Zettabyte: Don't like NCSoft...
[2:45:34] Sollice: It was lol but that TV in in living room :P So thats why I want a 42.
[2:45:42] CardinalTX: i play gw2 off and on but its a game that i feel like im not sure what i should be doing
[2:46:00] Relic7: They released an expansion?

[2:47:19] darssia_: i still need to finish the gw2 story. think i‚Äôm on like living world season 3 or something.
[2:47:26] Urebaldd: Sounds interesting, but probably won't be a wow scale mmo
[2:47:32] Caibo1: will you be playing in wrath classic at all?
[2:47:37] Sollice: Microsoft wants ALL the MMOs
[2:47:42] plebstertv: can you get renown from PVP?

[2:48:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: honestly i would play a modernized version of star wars galaxies, i tried the emulator version and just can't get into it LUL
[2:48:14] notColt45: Summit started playing then got annoyed with Pvp i think
[2:48:22] notColt45: They started SWTOR too I think
[2:48:37] plebstertv: Can someone whisper me and tell me whats the fastest way to get renown? I'm a pvper and it seems like you still have to grind
[2:48:42] bypized: I think Shroud still plays Classic, but off stream
[2:48:54] Sollice: @plebstertv Did you do the ZM quest line?
[2:49:12] Sylibusttv: @Towelliee I have a 3080 and I play on 7 graphics. Idk I have a weird issue where every 5-10 min my game freezes for a couple seconds then is fine. Disabled all addons and reinstalled game. Still having the issue. So not sure if 30 series is a good move. My 2070 didn‚Äôt have an issue.
[2:49:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: @plebstertv do lfr and pretty much every ZM quest gives a renown
[2:49:21] bypized: Summit played GW2 pvp for a while too

[2:49:56] Endogenous_: I just dont like the rolling around combat system of GW2
[2:49:59] Sollice: @plebstertv Get through chapter 3 of the Chains of Domination questline and than ZM will start. You will get a popup to meet an npc in Oribos

[3:20:19] SaichotickEQ: can you keep doing mission tables for gold after the expansion ends or does that get nerfed?
[3:20:42] Mistery836: I got 2.5k :)
[3:20:46] iVulpes: I remember when you could get the sandstone drake for 50k gold
[3:20:54] lawles_walrus: I paid 300 gold for 229 items
[3:21:00] Tokies: This mission table has been the best mission table since WOD
[3:21:01] lawles_walrus: This is why people buy wow tokens
[3:21:04] Zimmygee: should get your 1  262  crafted piece if you havent. Best investment
[3:21:10] Prisana: shoot i been broke im under 20k and ive been playing for years
[3:21:10] darssia_: just buy a wow token ez
[3:21:26] Stealinheals: doesn't the covv calling daily give like 1500 gold in vendor mats?
[3:21:27] swordart2022: bunch of haters in chat
[3:21:28] Teknofear64: mission table rocks
[3:21:29] lawles_walrus: Hold earning has not kept up with the market inflations in wow
[3:21:29] drunken_werewolf_hunter: would you check the AH if we ask nicely?
[3:21:34] swordart2022: @Tokies then dont do it hater
[3:21:34] CanadianCataclysm: WOD was the best one..
[3:21:35] Truthseeker96: if they put misson table in oribos i guarantee we'd all be using it daily on every toon
[3:21:37] therotkiw: loved legion table for sure
[3:21:40] Teknofear64: make all my gold from mission table
[3:21:40] CanadianCataclysm: you had a 2 for one in there
[3:21:41] enux337: the heirloom trinket was nice
[3:21:46] drunken_werewolf_hunter: I am actually more curious to see how the econ on your server is
[3:21:47] therotkiw: wod too
[3:21:50] luckfore: mission table is anti content
[3:21:52] cappei: Way too much gold pumped into the economy
[3:21:54] AndrewN1989: it was just busy work, give those cool things via other means
[3:21:58] Aidler: I liked the mission table. especially the wod version
[3:22:01] Teknofear64: been playing WoW for 4 years now from tokens
[3:22:01] rymerre: its destroyed the economy
[3:22:02] Xcenntric3k: @Towelliee Legion gold missions we're insane u could get up to 8k per mission
[3:22:03] darssia_: I love the mission table.
[3:22:05] Snappole_: think its nice optional content not bad to have
[3:22:06] Truthseeker96: put mission table in the new main city EZ
[3:22:07] Hundicasm: I only do my mission table on mobile before bed
[3:22:08] Zimmygee: It inflates the economy when i dont participate :D
[3:22:09] JediNeo99999: Sounds like the logic people have for hating LFR
[3:22:20] swordart2022: @luckfore where do you go for such nonsense takes ?
[3:22:23] Padarius: the ppl complaining about it are the same ones who cried that Draneor had no content. Gratz, you got what you wanted and still upset
[3:22:24] Velashen: I think it progressively got worse with each expansion is maybe the problem. Wod ones were good.
[3:22:27] dprima: Mission table is an extra for players no?
[3:22:28] vic_ave: man you guys are fishing hard today
[3:22:29] darssia_: passive pet charms from the mission table, so good.
[3:22:31] tetrahydridodinitrogen: The mission table is the reason why we dont have more raid teirs
[3:22:35] Maytan26: wow needs more gold sinks like the auction house mount
[3:22:35] ClassicMalcontent: Bots destroy the economy more than the mission tables alone. If there were no bots then sure. But with bots? Nah.
[3:22:39] danimoto10: master loot back is pretty good for the guilds
[3:22:41] AndrewN1989: its also just brain dead busy work that addons do for you, whats the point
[3:22:42] Clicklesly: I don't think the economy issues just come down to mission table now though
[3:23:03] rilsolo: previous 3 you mean Kappa
[3:23:06] warrenny: @danimoto10 Mythic guilds
[3:23:12] dprima: YES
[3:23:12] FrankTizzle: It's not even free, you gotta go mats to run the missions
[3:23:24] swordart2022: HOW dare you to play what you want !
[3:23:28] danimoto10: @warrenny heroic as well
[3:23:34] reggiepowa: you had to do legion campaigh through table as well
[3:23:35] darssia_: you can literally make thousands of gold just doing callings though. how is that not ruining the economy.
[3:23:35] Mistery836: keeping the silk you get from drops certainly is some good money too. they go for like 20 gold each and A LOT drops
[3:23:38] swordart2022: How dare there to be things for others !! / sarcasm
[3:23:42] dprima: For me the MOP have more in the farms
[3:23:43] Teknofear64: got 2 heirloom rings from garrison mission table
[3:23:49] Korupcija_: I think ti doesn't belong to mmos idk
[3:23:57] Maytan26: the mission table should only be for cosmetics and mounts
[3:23:59] Fusionxw: Can they stop making expension and realize that their game is dead
[3:24:00] Durk101: It‚Äôs more like economic stimulus
[3:24:02] swordart2022: I am big sad no mission table how do  iget pet charms then ???
[3:24:09] Truthseeker96: im telling you if mission table was in the main city everyone would use it and love it. going out of your way to get to the table is what turns me away from using it everyday
[3:24:12] AndrewN1989: no one will even notice it lol
[3:24:19] sakura_2020: save the TOP quest for the anima next week
[3:24:23] Fusionxw: Look at all the addons on the screen... my eyes
[3:24:24] Blackmarsh: 90% dont even use mission table
[3:24:31] swordart2022: I just farm that
[3:24:36] notColt45: Surely professions will be good for more than one patch next xpac COPIUM
[3:24:37] dreamwalker213: @fusionxw I‚Äôm curious what your definition of dead is lol
[3:24:40] swordart2022: Then buy next pets EZ
[3:24:56] Truthseeker96: @Blackmarsh 90% dont because first of all you have to travel to go use it and everyone sits in the city.
[3:25:07] faulen: have you looted all that gold?
[3:25:08] MILESkg21: Boreghast FeelsGoodMan
[3:25:17] Aidler: I really have no sympathy for those total anti stat opinions. don‚Äôt understand that at all
[3:25:27] Eviltuna13: I bought the 10k pet and all ready have almost 8k saved up again
[3:25:34] Fusionxw: @dreamwalker213 When people are stuck into playing a game that they know its been over for over 10 years

[3:25:53] swordart2022: @truthseeker96 so wrong when you can use it from toilet
[3:25:58] Shaele: Torghast was one of the few good additions to the game in this xpansion
[3:26:15] Truthseeker96: @fairplay2021 you think every player is gonna use that app? naw
[3:26:26] warrenny: @shaele Few?
[3:26:49] CYNIC308: @CHAT what was that mission table addon called?
[3:26:56] dreamwalker213: @fusionxw sure dude
[3:27:02] swordart2022: @truthseeker96 dude you got nothing dont make up numbers from your butt LUL
[3:27:04] vic_ave: 5 floors
[3:27:06] Fusionxw: At this point, people playing WoW are just sadistic. They love torturing themselves
[3:27:07] DeanoTV: 5
[3:27:12] homewrecker101: 5
[3:27:15] gronkina_kha: twisting corridor is the only thing that uses the old 6
[3:27:37] vic_ave: whats  that say about ppl  crying about other ppl playing then?
[3:27:39] MILESkg21: Fusionxw as opposed to Kappa
[3:28:23] Truthseeker96: @fairplay2021 lmfao dude you haven't said anything that would help the game. where as ive mentioned that if mission table were in city, ppl would use it more often. and those are facts. takes 2 mins to make gold.
[3:28:29] theSalute: torture <3
[3:28:52] WoW_StandalonE: 4Head
[3:28:58] TacDuc: Depends on the class, as some classes are super boring there
[3:28:58] UlsterFarl: Boregast, early versions killed it for me
[3:29:07] Samaellus: First version in Beta was fun, tho
[3:29:09] surealkiller83: I loved the concept but disliked the execution
[3:29:20] Dkgungo: they could do so much more with it though
[3:29:23] KairuruTV: crazy how the best version was the beta version
[3:29:33] CYNIC308: Dragonflight needs a advanced Torghast like an endless cave in the green dragon dream that is infinite and its a better Torghast but its a cave in the new xpac
[3:29:45] KairuruTV: i think they just need to stop trying to tie EVERYTHING to character progression
[3:29:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Not putting gear drops in Torghast was a mistake, imo
[3:30:10] swordart2022: @truthseeker96 Nonsense LUL
[3:30:13] DuransHybrid: torghast should be a leveling option
[3:30:25] DeanoTV: @DuransHybrid it is now
[3:30:27] DeanoTV: but its slow
[3:30:28] Baldarsar: the needed more transmog and pets and so in there
[3:30:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: People like getting gear, I'm not a cosmetics person
[3:30:30] Tokies: full clutch not putting gear in torghast! Needs more pets as well
[3:30:33] Aquadriel: @Towelliee should put all cosmetics from islands into torghast
[3:30:41] Maroleb: Corridors was a shitshow

[3:31:11] swordart2022: I did it wish you could skip to last .
[3:31:23] Fusionxw: I remember playing WoW 18 years ago. Now all i see is people playing that could never of let go of the game. Even WoW classic was such a disaster. So far from what it was. Dead game.
[3:31:31] Tokies: needed more pets
[3:31:38] fistofnature: but torggast has transmog and pets?
[3:31:53] dreamwalker213: @fusionxw then why are you watching a WoW stream
[3:31:56] DeanoTV: @Fusionxw awww poor guy lemme guess u like waiting 20 seconds to press 1 button KEKW

[3:32:14] rymerre: all those shoulders are pretty bad
[3:32:14] fistofnature: but the flail PepeHands
[3:32:18] Fusionxw: Stuck in a dead fantasy world that only disapoints
[3:32:26] Korupcija_: some are good
[3:32:27] notColt45: WoW has made us all fashionistas haha
[3:32:38] Kinghorn: Fusionxw you were probably still in your dads ball sack when vanilla came out
[3:32:44] Syprus1: they match the theme DULL and boring
[3:32:45] Cloudemon: they seem cool then you try to match them with anything and it sucks
[3:32:45] Kinghorn: get out of here zoomer
[3:32:46] eephuslive: !character
[3:32:47] ioyalty59: half the shoulders look the damn same
[3:33:09] TacDuc: @ioyaltygaming Spikes
[3:33:15] KairuruTV: theres a reason so many of us mainly transmog vanilla-wotlk gear lol
[3:33:19] eephuslive: what class is this
[3:33:30] Kinghorn: survival hunter eephuslive
[3:33:31] Syprus1: survival hunter
[3:33:37] MILESkg21: https://twitter.com/Wowhead/status/1520029382735187968 oh shit monkaS this can't be real

[3:33:45] warrenny: @knetiktv You want low res meh sets?
[3:33:53] notColt45: Sounds like a lot of new content added in the last few years Sadge
[3:33:59] JustAwaay: most hated torhgast becouse you had to do it for legos
[3:34:02] Kisswani: I still love how crazy powerful you feel after collecting a couple of anima powers
[3:34:08] CYNIC308: i think thats Blizzard
[3:34:10] RaegonGaming: They should know by now, we want all the shit :P
[3:34:11] Fusionxw: @Kinghorn ummmm no.  I had WoW vanilla, Css, C&C zero hour, half life. All great games. All i see now is dead games and dead sheeps playing these games.
[3:34:18] Thoreya: need more casual stuff like that
[3:34:21] Jollywhompus: Islands > Torghast
[3:34:23] danimoto10: so towellie when we gonna know what you did yesterday? is it a seceret project?
[3:34:34] KairuruTV: fusion sounds bitter about gaming
[3:34:35] darssia_: we wanted islands to just be cosmetics, we didn‚Äôt want to be forced to do them for ap. that‚Äôs the difference.
[3:34:36] Kinghorn: so what are you playing these days mr Fusionxw
[3:34:37] fewyn: i liked islands because they were fast and had good rewards and were kind of fun
[3:34:37] net_mi: Island was ok, would 've been great if content was a little more difficult
[3:34:42] Fusionxw: Video games has been horrible for over a century now toddlers!!! WAKE UP
[3:34:56] Horseweave: Island were just not given enough challenge imo
[3:34:58] DeanoTV: lmao u just got old dude

[3:35:14] JFeezy__: @Fusionxw dude take your hot takes somewhere else. Nobody has time for your bs.
[3:35:17] Maroleb: up to 4
[3:35:20] KairuruTV: its not good, no fun allowed
[3:35:25] CYNIC308: Blizz main problem these days is interpreting feedback incorrectly ... island were cool just make them better, torghast is a good idea but boring, classic is awesome but SoM is to soon
[3:35:26] J_Rich94: oh Thanos Gauntlet?
[3:35:32] SaichotickEQ: Video games have been horrible for 100 years @Fusionxw ?
[3:35:38] Maroleb: all the gauntlet levels after 4 only give currency
[3:35:44] Kinghorn: video games peaked at pong guys
[3:35:49] Kinghorn: stop playing them
[3:36:07] Maroleb: yes
[3:36:13] Mistery836: maybe it'll be a talent. that would be cool
[3:36:13] enux337: yep its a leggo
[3:36:15] rilsolo: it was the first and only one of those wish they did more stuff like that
[3:36:18] DragerAZ: Yes
[3:36:21] luke238: it sounded nice on paper but its so clunky to play with
[3:36:29] Kinghorn: a legendary nobody uses nitema11Cry
[3:36:39] dreamwalker213: It‚Äôs super cool but the gcd/execution felt super bad
[3:36:56] pavepawns: i dont think the ilvl is correct atm but on ptr gear drops at 262 on m+ 0
[3:36:57] notColt45: This is whole ark Pog

[3:38:29] rilsolo: its fine he is used to sitting around and doing nothing
[3:38:31] TacDuc: @pavepawns Atleast he doesn't get chain sores anymore
[3:38:35] pavepawns: funny part is they dont even offer him a seat. he just sits on the floor
[3:38:38] MILESkg21: Fusion be on some shit KEKW

[3:47:59] mrpresbaby: This would be such a bummer as a new player or someone getting back into the game having to do all this just for end game stuff
[3:48:25] Kisswani: @mrpresbaby not really , because a new player wouldn't know better
[3:48:38] ZeusDNA: ^
[3:48:41] raldrik: yeah max said he wants one during alpha
[3:48:44] Padarius: Max is to busy making them commercials

[4:41:58] GamerKillance: Damn it i dont wanna play lol
[4:42:01] Jokervenom1978: @Towelliee Just got my first shipment of GFuel. I got strawberry banana and a Sweedish Fish flavor. Both are great!
[4:42:05] Alllprimer: gonna be instant no LUL
[4:42:06] Esperz: Have you tried the Tiny Tina GFuel yet @Towelliee ?
[4:42:11] TacDuc: Most energy drinks are not that good for you if you have heart issues
[4:42:30] MILESkg21: Swedish is so good Kreygasm
[4:42:37] Mourningztar: truedat
[4:42:38] Nehcrom: Swedish fish is the bomb (and yes I am a swede and we dont really have it).
[4:42:41] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee haven't watched you for a while, do you still play Lost Ark?
[4:42:52] Nehcrom: @MilesKG21 <3
[4:43:09] GamerKillance: Lost Ark doesn't have much right now once you hit 1300
[4:43:12] MILESkg21: Eye of Sauron monkaS
[4:43:20] CYNIC308: just checked Stormrage and you can buy full set of 262 leather armor for 59K
[4:43:28] TacDuc: You're hiding in it's blind spot, directly beneath it
[4:43:32] N3llee: lancer crap
[4:43:35] N3llee: ah man that hurts
[4:43:41] Forlagon: Lost Ark was just way too much for my casual ass to handle
[4:43:42] Strange_Inquiries: @MilesKG21 He wishes he was that powerful. Morgoth too op!
[4:43:43] N3llee: its my new main
[4:43:49] GamerKillance: @Towelliee You think 9.25 will be Shadowlands last patch? Ion did say there WERE plans for 9.3. Think it'll exist or cut like WoD with the .2 patch
[4:43:59] Egzolinas: Oh good old Korthia :)
[4:44:03] PvtHudson093: i dont see no city
[4:44:05] OutFamous: hey @Towelliee and chat! how alt friendly is the game now? i was thinking of coming back and levelling a warlock or DH. it's either that or FF14
[4:44:23] EKS90_: i came back recently, had to do the 4 first steps here for flying. and My god... it was really not fun at all..
[4:44:25] Nehcrom: @OutFamous Always friendly!
[4:44:39] dreamwalker213: @outfamous if you have a max level main that has done most of the content it‚Äôs really alt friendly
[4:45:05] PvtHudson093: Be glad you didnt need to grind 2 lots of rep for pathfinder step 1 and 2
[4:45:07] Praetour: Those 226 conduits in ZM will be big too
[4:45:12] SiXKiNG_: yeah
[4:45:12] TacDuc: Yup
[4:45:19] raldrik: yeah and you kill the eye of the jailer so that goes away
[4:45:29] Praetour: 500g and friendly I think
[4:45:32] CYNIC308: yea 9.1 Korthia introduced mounts to the maw
[4:45:51] OutFamous: @dreamwalker213 i have max level character that did some bosses in SoD but didn't get to max level renown i don't think
[4:46:02] CYNIC308: 262 full set of leather for 59K right now
[4:46:05] EKS90_: I was leveling in tbc anyway for wotlk, and i decided to catch up on retail, so yeah, got 52 renown and flying unlocked atleast. havent played since 2 months into SL
[4:46:11] CYNIC308: on Stormrage
[4:46:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Goat cheese!
[4:46:26] Jokervenom1978: Goat cheese is POG
[4:46:28] jarilrpg: @cynic308 you can only wear one of those pieces
[4:46:46] theDirtyon3: its super fatty yeah
[4:46:49] fewyn: goat cheese is good
[4:47:05] OutFamous: isn't all cheese keto friendly?
[4:47:08] dreamwalker213: @outfamous I would probably recommend hitting 80 on your main so you can buy the renown catchup for your alt. Other than that your alt should be pretty set
[4:47:12] theDirtyon3: yes
[4:47:15] brentosxd: @cynic308 how,?
[4:47:21] MOLAR305: still loving walking around on Wen Lo mount, great 6 month aniversary mount
[4:47:22] stallowned: woot woot
[4:47:43] TigbittiesXXL: @cynic308 yes buy alll 262 and cry when you can only wear one peice
[4:47:45] OutFamous: @dreamwalker213 does it take a long time or is there a lot of catchup?
[4:47:47] LurkLimit: @brentosxd upgraded crafted gear is unique equip.
[4:48:27] Strange_Inquiries: Is it nooby of me that I think hunter is the coolest class? I'm a huntard....
[4:48:32] dreamwalker213: @outfamous nah doesn‚Äôt take long at all. I boosted a warrior alt and was immediately like 230 ilvl and started doing m+
[4:48:44] Hitokiri83: theres a quest but not part of the campain
[4:48:46] BTiZZY_: how‚Äôs the survival life been?
[4:48:48] ShinoaKurisu: its just an anima side quest
[4:48:54] homewrecker101: theres a quest to am sure
[4:49:07] UnheardGaming: survival looks fun
[4:49:17] TacDuc: Theoretically if we destroyed Oribos, then what would happen to the souls, as they are streaming down into oribos, and from the gets directed around the zones.
[4:49:21] Tokies: if you do LFR the first 3 days of reset it's a lot better then later in the week
[4:49:27] CodyKane: yes it is
[4:49:31] Lezzemos: yup
[4:49:32] Exxcar: call of primus is ZM quest
[4:49:33] St0rmyPl4ys: even warlock kinda of sucks cause voidwalker is a shitty end game tank
[4:49:40] OutFamous: @dreamwalker213 cool thanks for the help, might just use that wow token i have. setting up addons again will be a pain in the ass tho
[4:49:58] TacDuc: @St0rmyPl4ys Yeah, you outaggro it in like 3 dot
[4:50:01] Malnar1123: Flying in ZM is seperate unlock.....
[4:50:04] Mourningztar: youll have to unlock flyinh in ZM
[4:50:09] TheAbraxas94: you cant fly in zm no matter what
[4:50:12] EKS90_: yeah ZM flying is seperrate
[4:50:19] Exxcar: Flying in ZM is its own achievement
[4:50:22] raldrik: yeah zm flying is different than SL mainland flying
[4:50:28] Strange_Inquiries: Didn't they remove 280?
[4:50:35] Cryttan: God damn u got 34k on this toon? How did you farm it?
[4:50:37] Strange_Inquiries: Or am i retarded?
[4:50:37] EKS90_: 44 renown and chapter 4 of korthia gives you flying in SL
[4:50:38] dreamwalker213: @outfamous np, it‚Äôs definitely the most alt friendly wow has been in a long time imo
[4:50:42] neo_0098: how does this 9 to 5 thing aktually work?
[4:50:43] Tokies: you gotta do questz in zm to fly
[4:50:45] raldrik: Sl flying is the Korthia to 3rd step then finish the cov campaign
[4:51:00] Tokies: truth flying in shadowlands better game
[4:51:16] Hitokiri83: dont forget to do calling for renown
[4:51:23] EKS90_: @raldrik no u have to do the last sigil, which is chapter 4 in korthia, i did it 5 days ago
[4:51:39] stallowned: im still not exalted with that rep. at rev and tired of the damn dailys lol
[4:51:46] monsai83: Yooo Thanks for the gifted sub! I appreciate it so much!
[4:52:13] Tokies: When you make it to 80 renown you can calling hop for raw gold
[4:52:38] theDirtyon3: i have all the korthia mounts i am pretty proud of that

[4:56:03] Maruika: returning and farming naj and mechagon rep for flying was the worst wow experience of my life
[4:56:19] grimweirdd: coming back in BFA was an absolute nightmare. so many currencies, so many dailies, so much to do and only a small amount of it being enjoyable
[4:56:23] Kisswani: season 4
[4:56:26] Kisswani: M+ it seems
[4:56:42] grimweirdd: during early covid i would wake up and spend 4 hours doing my "daily wow chores" just so i could stay relevant in my raiding guild

[4:58:21] Kinghorn: yay korthia
[4:58:45] TheUnknowing: just sounds like you pick a bonus or power like you did with the anima powers in 9.1
[4:59:02] RageerPLZ: I hope Season 4 shows better/more fun tier like when corruption was at max level shit was so fun.

[5:04:27] theDirtyon3: its for the clash of clans Warcraft game
[5:04:31] Mourningztar: Bluetooth controllers work on some
[5:04:53] wolvepg: onscreen controls on a ipad won't work for me i have little thumbs
[5:04:56] michaelkn: @Arcon2825 there is no mobile device that comes close to desktop performance simply due to overheating
[5:05:01] chaotikz7: What makes you think warcraft players want to go outside? PokemonGO-like game not happening

[5:06:29] Warblade23: As someone who has both the Ipad pro and the Samsung tab s8+ i say get the s8+ because of dex support. Its makes it so much easier to play mobile games on your pc.
[5:06:37] dokor: @Towelliee but, isn't doing stuff five years too late the blizzard way ? ^^

[5:10:32] budly: @Towelliee you want to carve on cd, reduces CD on bombs
[5:10:40] EKS90_: the most fun part, is that ZM is easier to kill mobs in than korthia. for low ILVL.
[5:11:07] TacDuc: I will do it just to kill people
[5:11:14] CrunkyBrewster: yeah it is

[5:12:24] ziglar: OMEGALUL
[5:12:34] GamerKillance: Its similar to the Maw. People hardly went to Korthia just like they hardly went to the Maw. Least played zone if we're going by player made statistics
[5:12:47] delsea: for ZM u need to do all the quest line yes?
[5:13:15] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i barely did Kor when I came back to the game. I saw no point it.

[5:13:41] BattleKnoedel: source: trust me
[5:13:48] CrunkyBrewster: eh maybe the weapon you got from the first Kor quest if you needed the upgrade on an alt. But i hardly touched it
[5:13:50] MessyZerg: did korhia more then ZM
[5:14:05] Clicklesly: Don't forget all the the leather farmers who still stay in Korthia ^^
[5:14:16] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i hardly touched it much. most of my gear upgrades came out of Mythic+
[5:14:18] MILESkg21: ^^
[5:14:18] GamerKillance: We all know casual players run the game for revenue. I would say most casuals avoided the Maw areas like the plague]
[5:14:25] Shrenko: I like zerith mortis
[5:14:32] swordart2022: I did korthia for mogs
[5:14:40] MILESkg21: farming mats in dead zones is always fun
[5:14:43] mavericks312: atleast you had to grind korthia you don't have to grind ZM
[5:14:48] jamb39: I genuinely liked Korthia
[5:14:50] GamerKillance: Zerith Mortis came out like it did due to the lack of playtime by casual players on their previous end game zones
[5:15:09] highlydegen: no 226 ZM gear???
[5:15:11] kunqq147: A Newbie really has to play Korthia nowadays ?
[5:15:11] CrunkyBrewster: I did the Maw for the Reknown and for Rep with whatsherface. I actually enjoyed the Maw funny enough LUL
[5:15:16] jaalexba: wtf you ridin a liger?

[5:16:00] highlydegen: is he doing a "new player" play through, is that why no ZM 226 gear?

[5:16:15] MILESkg21: new player new account
[5:16:22] highlydegen: ahh
[5:16:24] CrunkyBrewster: Oh shoot thats right my bad
[5:16:26] CrunkyBrewster: forgot about that
[5:16:30] GamerKillance: Heroic dungeons drop 226

[5:16:46] DallTV_: xD
[5:16:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah things are looking good for WoW
[5:16:55] Merex760: All good changes. Philosophy change was needed badly
[5:16:56] brentosxd: what sword
[5:17:18] CrunkyBrewster: indeed agreed
[5:17:25] VerdeSol3: my friends
[5:17:30] AgentWhiskeyy: Did you like the interview on twitter? Did you feel like enough of the player base got their questions answered?
[5:17:33] VerdeSol3: just really did a job
[5:17:39] CrunkyBrewster: Yup same here. I wanna see it in action
[5:17:42] VerdeSol3: a new game mode
[5:17:47] Merex760: Yeah, I didn't like how coy/non-specific they were about that
[5:17:50] VerdeSol3: Columbus rat purgatory
[5:17:56] VerdeSol3: midnight tonight
[5:17:59] alextheory_: reputation 100% PLEASE
[5:18:05] VerdeSol3: f that s up
[5:18:09] Thoriakk: like in Lost Ark !
[5:18:09] Aidler: I don‚Äòt M+ and don‚Äôt raid so with 10.0 I might need a new game besides WoW
[5:18:18] TheGiant99: @towelliee is anyone going to add guild quests this week in Lost Ark
[5:18:22] CrunkyBrewster: they'll never do account wide reps LUL I mean it would be awesome, but I hold doubt
[5:18:22] dodgerke: reputation i hope
[5:18:27] highlydegen: BALANCE OF POWER ACCOUNT WIDE PLEASE
[5:18:27] fewyn: totallyu
[5:18:27] MILESkg21: REP PLZ
[5:18:29] Merex760: Hell yeah
[5:18:33] CrunkyBrewster: HELL YEAH
[5:18:34] cohesity: rep account wide would love thartr
[5:18:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it would be nice to have it all account-wide when it comes to rep and currencies
[5:18:45] lukeng89: would love it but more work for blizz measn they wont?
[5:18:53] CrunkyBrewster: possibly
[5:18:58] garbagaha: thanks for seeing my comment and answering my question really appreciate it <3
[5:19:04] CrunkyBrewster: could cost them two raid tiers Kappa
[5:19:09] PvtHudson093: the proof is in the pudding
[5:19:35] ItsYojimbo: Gold should be account wide
[5:19:54] highlydegen: gold is account wide in a sense, but yeah its half assed
[5:19:56] Praetour: The 3k rating 278 is the worst non-account bound imo
[5:19:59] Onisekai: @wooly858 oh hell yeah
[5:19:59] shinta__: I haven't leveled an alt because of the same shit
[5:20:06] CrunkyBrewster: if Gold was account wide... oh man, I woudl not have to pay for a sub for a while
[5:20:08] Maruika: everything should be account wide imo no joke, gear trading and all.
[5:20:16] fewyn: yes
[5:20:19] wolvepg: i only play one character this tier, was playing a few last tier .
[5:20:39] Kisswani: people do it for renown if anything
[5:20:40] kunqq147: Yea they do. For Renonwn
[5:20:45] ItsYojimbo: I would play alts a lot more if that was the case
[5:20:48] nightmayor12: easy to find a group after reset but yeah they still knock it over
[5:21:01] Belasard: i did morgeth yesterday. takes a while for the group to form i think. but people do
[5:21:10] VerdeSol3: I hear rat Freemont is next
[5:21:16] VerdeSol3: dumb s
[5:21:55] TyrsisJaedoran: omg I would love that
[5:22:02] raldrik: They dont want you to be able to just buy gear with that currency. That is Ion's holdup
[5:22:02] Aidler: as soon as everything is account wide and your character is super and quickly customizable‚Ä¶. there will be no need for alts anymore
[5:22:04] nightmayor12: I don't think everything should be account wide tbh
[5:22:08] Dimeric: All about the WoW's messy coding.
[5:22:11] CrunkyBrewster: all those Apex Crystals I'd have Kreygasm
[5:22:22] michaelkn: People are underestimating the engine if they think it cant support account wide currencies
[5:22:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, mailing gold to alts is just a hassle
[5:22:46] lovemymage: nothing probably just lot of development time
[5:22:53] TacDuc: Because that 30 copper postal fee makes a difference
[5:22:55] stratiss: probably just old coding, remember how difficult it was for them to add backpack slots?
[5:23:09] swordart2022: valor=gear.
[5:23:15] Smeaghoul: If gold was account wide you could send it to other serves which could affect the economy
[5:23:15] Rainchrome: doesnt gw2 share gold between toons?
[5:23:22] CrunkyBrewster: I think an easy fix for accoutn wide gold would be to put the Gold in our Bank, like ESO has it
[5:23:24] Valzark: i got 20k flux that i cant use on my main but my alts could use it
[5:23:25] wolvepg: Would not be account wide realm based? or am i understand it incorectly
[5:23:28] grapyz: Could you Imagine if mounts wer'ent account wide lol, I'd cry
[5:23:32] CYNIC308: valor is different because you dont deserve top gear on a class you are not a top pvper
[5:23:32] Arocian: good idea
[5:23:42] CrunkyBrewster: Hell yes
[5:23:47] Kisswani: Valor is really the main currency I want account wide
[5:23:49] stabzmcgeee: didnt they already say that due to the sheer amount of stuff from 20years of the game that its really hard to do account wide stuff,, thats why they do BoA tokens i.e the 40 rekwon thing etc
[5:23:52] kunqq147: Good Idea. Also M+ Rating accwide ?
[5:23:53] Arocian: cash out after its no longer useful
[5:23:58] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[5:24:06] Artenuous: spaghooter code tho KEKW
[5:24:08] Molvonos: @cynic308 Valor is honor???
[5:24:11] Valzark: valor not honor
[5:24:11] Lintgamer: @cynic308 that is some bs dude :D
[5:24:14] vic_ave: Valor is from Pve not PVP
[5:24:16] theDirtyon3: some motherfucking people man LUL
[5:24:18] Praetour: KEKW
[5:24:19] darkeagle7561: you're not worthy PepeHands
[5:24:19] CrunkyBrewster: Oh yeah M+ Rating Account wide would be a godsend
[5:24:23] wolvepg: You earned it
[5:24:26] swordart2022: simple they play different .
[5:24:27] Praetour: Elitist copium
[5:24:29] NotEnoughMana: you earned the valor on the main and use it on the alt wtf LUL
[5:24:41] MessyZerg: they don't want you to 'finish' the game
[5:24:41] CrunkyBrewster: borrowed valor Kappa
[5:24:48] grapyz: If someone gets 3k rating, I think we can agree the player has a pretty good understanding of how each classes in the game works
[5:24:49] Chickenman117: I think mastery of a specific class is important
[5:24:51] Rictamar: its like the tax for transferring anima to alts...why???
[5:24:51] Akermay: my concern is they said they want to retain the gear upgrade journey. being able to easily get it via your main would side step that
[5:24:52] Colt_Engineer: found the capitalist in here
[5:24:59] Rictamar: Blizzard loves punishing players for no reason
[5:24:59] darkeagle7561: @Crunku_ LUL
[5:25:08] CrunkyBrewster: :D
[5:25:19] deadalon: Ian talked a bit about this yesterday when talking to Azmongold.  He said they would not allow thngs accountwide that provided gear.  Might work for other things
[5:25:22] Clicklesly: @Crunku_ Iirc in S1 it worked off the achiev at least, after that it all got tied to character rating
[5:25:43] CrunkyBrewster: ah okay
[5:26:11] swordart2022: not really there is vendor for gear with valor.
[5:26:17] stabzmcgeee: imagine account wide valor with the current cap
[5:26:21] stabzmcgeee: would be bad
[5:26:28] raldrik: ion has basically said no to that. Gear and gear systems are character specific.
[5:26:40] fewyn: people complaing i just imagine are old men yelling at the sky meme
[5:27:21] swordart2022: No one wastes valor to buy gear.
[5:27:22] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[5:27:34] jtm1337: so is it gonna be WotLK classic+ ?
[5:28:00] SiXKiNG_: been making decent money selling the ZM mount mats
[5:28:11] CYNIC308: i understand your point but you going to get a lot of max geared players who dont know their alt class and its gonna be ugly
[5:28:16] Arcon_LP: Didn't Ion say besides loot, everything would get accountwide? I might be wrong though.
[5:28:18] ItsYojimbo: The problem is they build themselves into the box that thinks timegated/grindgated things are what keeps people playing longer. Which just isn‚Äôt true. The majority of players (the casual player) would play a lot more if blizzard put their efforts into making alts feel better to extend peoples play time.
[5:28:23] Colt_Engineer: morrowed power?
[5:28:54] falldrgn: Hide the porn!
[5:29:01] MILESkg21: monkaS
[5:29:13] swordart2022: BOOBA
[5:29:17] LeXieSterling: I wish my hunters pets were account wide.
[5:29:19] Colt_Engineer: imagine watching porn in 2022
[5:29:40] sneak_e_dog: how old were you when you started playing wow?
[5:29:49] theDirtyon3: Truth LUL
[5:29:52] theDirtyon3: that wont change shit
[5:29:52] TacDuc: The fuck is a class
[5:29:59] Praetour: So they learn at 276 ilvl instead of at 220 ilvl what horror
[5:30:06] aikopooh: booster animals lolz
[5:30:09] pereadin: Always down bro
[5:30:12] hestar: Tauren Rogue baby!

[5:30:41] CYNIC308: yea learn your alt class at 233 M+2 not learn your alt at 275 M+20
[5:30:45] a_joc: 20 sang this week is easy
[5:30:46] brentosxd: Draenei rogue bis
[5:30:46] Colt_Engineer: @Shrenko all classes and specs are good
[5:30:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: A 22 Sanguine sounds spicy
[5:30:49] Malarick: gotta click it
[5:30:52] Kinghorn: only 9?
[5:30:55] swordart2022: @Shrenko check raider io if you care for asnwer.
[5:30:56] raye_gaming22: its a homage on the bag that never droped in CN from him
[5:30:57] Kinghorn: need to click it 9000
[5:31:21] raye_gaming22: and it dos nothing
[5:31:21] Strange_Inquiries: thats fair
[5:31:29] SnowMew: also if you dont know how to play, your rating goes down so it's not like anyone's punished anyway
[5:31:29] novlen: $60 to skip the training of learning while leveling haha
[5:31:32] Alepouditsa: i do! i click 1 button Kappa
[5:31:34] RespectedBandito: I know some mf'ers that have been on the same class for 10 years and still don't know lol
[5:31:42] Scoodles91: if you havent boosted :D
[5:31:42] swordart2022: DUDE i have seen 1 char andys
[5:31:43] Zavier420: I remember @Towelliee saying before he started playing he was a work and heard a couple guys talking about WoW and was like like "Look at you little orc bitches"...lol
[5:31:43] Praetour: You haven't been in LFR recently @Towelliee Kappa
[5:31:44] swordart2022: having 0 idea
[5:31:45] Sylphy_TV: Sudden amnesia O.o
[5:31:54] CYNIC308: muscle memory is a huge part of it all at M+20
[5:31:58] Altruit: a lot of people freeze up and panic
[5:32:04] darkeagle7561: who the hell am I?!?
[5:32:04] vic_ave: haha

[5:33:06] enux337: purple rain
[5:33:12] RespectedBandito: Warrior? you just die
[5:33:17] Alepouditsa: i wish the do more with battle pets  danSad i need more max lvl and more dungions and raids for them
[5:33:21] Smart_Parrot: towSip
[5:33:22] Colt_Engineer: tbf blizzard doesn't know what they're doing to prot warriors
[5:33:27] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee How did you react to Ions reply about black drake type tanks in the interview the other day? ?
[5:33:30] SnowMew: who cares. as long as you're having fun and not ruining anyone else's day, it doesnt matter
[5:33:34] RUSTbomb: I forget when BC came out do we need to pay to transfer our BC characters to Wrath ?

[5:33:40] Hyelander_: They gave up on Prot warrior
[5:33:49] CYNIC308: you're right its not that the gear is coming to fast its muscle memory and the cost of a mistake at that ilvl is much more costly
[5:33:56] wolvepg: @RespectedBandito false tho, they are still poop but not true
[5:33:59] Bayne77: bayne77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months!

[5:35:19] CYNIC308: thats a good point! i didnt think of it that way
[5:35:19] Rictamar: exactly, who gives a fuck, the xpac is over its time to have fun
[5:35:31] novlen: Yeah. Odd thought. You work hard on your main and your alt should be slightly easier after that. It's not a hard concept.
[5:35:32] uhhhhyeayoo: You also have to get to 2k m+ score to fully upgrade those items with valor
[5:35:39] Colt_Engineer: lol pepega

[5:36:55] Kinghorn: delete PI
[5:36:58] nightmayor12: And they try to pull like they are in MDI. it is scary
[5:37:03] MILESkg21: 11 minutes KEKW

[5:37:18] Scoodles91: f the metasleves....

[6:38:43] evnaae: DOnt need the center pack if you play it right
[6:38:45] Strange_Inquiries: @Sollice As long as he is sure he wants to go. I find that often we tend to push the younger ones to schooling because it seems like the best prospect but there are many paths to success. As long as he wants to that is freaking awesome! Higher education institutions can be great!

[6:40:16] 91Niki: Nah nah nah, if you know anything about medical stuff and stab wounds. The last thing you want to do is just pull out the object that stabbed you. That's how you bleed to death. We can't just pull that sword out with out a plan
[6:40:23] SageRuskiy: @Mistery836 they are literally all over the place wdym
[6:40:28] Strange_Inquiries: @91Niki You're absolutely right. The pandemic made me realize how little you mean to your employers so you have to look out for yourself. Especially having been one of the essential workers that worked throughout the whole pandemic. Changed my view on many things.
