[2:04:49] infektyd: SO LIKE AN OPPOSITE DEFILE
[2:04:54] infektyd: nmot that excited.. sorry for caps
[2:04:59] Masqerader: and only heals for many half the health
[2:05:03] Masqerader: *maybe
[2:05:06] ThePawPaw: @Towelliee here is my subs affex idea, when sanguin meets volcanic to get burn and if you put ads on it they get ignite/or tick dmg just idea :)
[2:05:20] jarilrpg: that would be good, there are too many channeling trash mobs in these dungeons that you can not knock

[2:08:24] that_guy_chain: warrior tank always been pretty strong with mitigation
[2:08:58] ronny_84: what do you think of all the brewmaster buffs coming in 10.5
[2:09:00] infektyd: the adjustment of making 2 talent point things to only needing one talent point can help classes... like the tuesday change coming to BrM
[2:09:37] Masqerader: Paladins should have gotten ashen hollow :P
[2:09:42] superpudd: Luxthos new weakauras made mastering dusk and dawn so much easier
[2:10:15] PvtHudson093: All paladins need that talent
[2:10:32] infektyd: how much mitigation is tied to DK DnD? i know damage is tied to it and such
[2:10:39] NBK_Sethus: well yeah, gotta keep in mind that consecrate and death & decay were created when there was much less mobility
[2:11:00] that_guy_chain: i like this convocation about tanking lol
[2:12:14] sdpercussion: how does it hold up above 20's?

[2:13:05] that_guy_chain: id go for the radeon 6950xt graphics card
[2:13:12] Shinigasumi: Reason why Death Strike feels so strong is because they made Blood Shield relevant. Without Blood Shield, it's only really a portion of what it's supposed to be.
[2:13:32] that_guy_chain: such a smooth play with the super resolution
[2:13:58] Contendedlemon: i did a +16 this dungeon with a boomy without solar beam, it was great

[2:15:37] showmethesugar35: Those poor Giants...
[2:15:49] warrenny: Bird boss is worst?
[2:15:52] akia03: get it crafted
[2:15:57] Sylphy_TV: If you spec Solar beam you lose DPS EZ Ez choice
[2:16:11] Shinigasumi: Absolutely you're supposed to grab up the orbs instead of blowing them up. Nailed it.
[2:16:14] MakaiiART: had an enh shaman in ghost wolf run in circles take all the orbs on a fucking +19, i swear he had to be boosted lol
[2:16:16] Ardailec: Bird boss hitslike a truck
[2:16:39] Shinigasumi: It's the peck he does that hurts, for sure.

[2:17:29] sgtswoll: Yeah no boomies take solar beam it is like 5-10%dps loss for a 1min cd
[2:17:47] warrenny: @shinigasumi Isnt that obvious a month in?
[2:17:56] that_guy_chain: noo way that was actually really good presley impersination!
[2:18:07] Shinigasumi: Ever seen a Hunter without Misdirect?
[2:18:43] Shinigasumi: @warrenny I was agreeing with someone. Not sure what your question is about.
[2:19:10] akia03: not enough points for misdirect
[2:19:11] donin: more boomies will have beam after tuesday
[2:19:12] watchthemgrow: i use it on cd
[2:19:17] daconcion: MD as a talent is awful, it should be baseline. But BM hunters realistically don't even want MD because it doesn't work with pet damage.
[2:19:22] Eviltuna13: i have it macroed to Milti-shoot
[2:19:28] Aegllor: most builds on guides don't talent into MD
[2:19:28] xxxpleblordxxx: most hunter dont spec in misdirect
[2:19:34] sgtswoll: Yeah all boomies should have beam after Tuesday with new trees
[2:19:50] bigstick258: is md built into plus builds?
[2:19:55] warrenny: @shinigasumi Sorry missed first statement
[2:20:01] dreamwalker213: In keys you 100% spec into MD
[2:20:03] daconcion: MM hunters should always spec into MD, but BM hunters kinda can't without losing something important
[2:20:11] Bernardo994: full of music today arnet ya
[2:20:23] NBK_Sethus: tbh the biggest pain in the ass in this area is those mounds that make 2D effects clip through

[2:20:32] bigstick258: bm i dont think specs md in plus
[2:20:41] Eviltuna13: MD and Tricks should be baseline
[2:20:52] Cabbageman007: It was the Josh Lowe Celebration Card Opening Stream
[2:20:54] that_guy_chain: i want to see his best impersonation
[2:20:56] mrpresbaby: Dude I thought you said carbs lol
[2:21:00] that_guy_chain: get him on the voice#11
[2:21:06] daconcion: BM and MD don't work well together. MD only counts the hunter damage, and doesn't include pet damage, so it's not as useful
[2:21:28] daconcion: Plus the talent is out of the way for BM hunters
[2:21:37] bigstick258: md isnt baseline for bm
[2:22:01] daconcion: but you can still take it as BM, and I do for my M+ spec, but I always prefer MM for keys anyways
[2:22:05] Eviltuna13: @daconcion I have a maceo set up that MD to my focus and if there is no Focus it MD to my pat
[2:22:21] Eviltuna13: Pet*
[2:22:42] EvenstarTV: @Eviltuna13 same lol
[2:22:52] daconcion: @Eviltuna13 Same, I also include mouseover before target but after pet
[2:23:17] swervity82: mine is Reid Detmers
[2:23:38] NBK_Sethus: and those packs in SBG between first and second bosses
[2:23:48] Shinigasumi: Death Bolt don't play around, for sure.
[2:23:53] AustinOranje: how are the morning keys going?
[2:24:08] Nuggets1002: I have a Justin Jefferson rookie ticket auto /22
[2:24:33] SpidercowSD: @Towelliee How do you feel about the way they have done loot this Xpac? Ive gone 5 weeks with zero natural Tier Drops on three toons ive needed the Vault to get items.
[2:25:17] dutchie76: 10 dead in shooting in Monterey Park, Calif., with suspected gunman at large
[2:25:19] dutchie76: damn man
[2:25:27] dutchie76: another mass shooting
[2:25:51] dutchie76: monterey park california
[2:25:59] Eviltuna13: looking at my hunter Macros and i still have the trap launcher macros crreamClown
[2:26:52] dutchie76: north of LA Rob
[2:27:21] daconcion: Unholy should 100% be taking slappy hands in m+
[2:27:36] infektyd: while pulling trash here for %, can dip toes in there i belkieve to start RP while still doing trash
[2:27:51] Sylphy_TV: Can you only get 1 Inspiration a week or is there a catchup for alts?
[2:28:12] infektyd: can do them all at once
[2:28:12] Xara36: 0 tier on my main, 2 alts have 4pc
[2:28:13] Bulgogiprince: I would prefer it if it was earlier but every other week
[2:28:15] infektyd: no CD for alts
[2:28:16] dutchie76: will MM hunter be retired next week? LUL
[2:28:16] jarilrpg: @SpidercowSD all of the tier i have on three of my characters (even my main) are from the vault
[2:28:24] PvtHudson093: not seen a weapon drop from M+ yet
[2:28:29] NBK_Sethus: pretty obvious that the loot system was designed around 1 weekly upgrade
[2:28:44] EvenstarTV: @dutchie76 Why would theyÉ
[2:28:45] daconcion: @dutchie76 I'm thinking about retiring mine for my DK lmao
[2:28:50] dutchie76: yea, that's why the have the crafting system
[2:28:50] NBK_Sethus: stay subbed and keep griding basically
[2:28:55] EvenstarTV: ?*

[2:29:47] dreamwalker213: By the portals
[2:29:49] daconcion: @dutchie76 losing Double tap hurts, it's not the end of the world, especially with the trueshot CD reduction, but it's hard to say how much worse we will be in keys without DT burst
[2:30:08] dutchie76: @dutchie76 yea
[2:30:25] frodozeph: frodozeph subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[2:30:36] dreamwalker213: @daconcion it’s a nerf for sure but I don’t think it kills the spec in m+. Probably still better then BM
[2:30:42] ronny_84: a bit extreme but for frequent mythic plus leavers ban them for the rest of the season
[2:31:13] dutchie76: what is this Rideshare? LUL
[2:31:17] brewgamingtv: no way people would troll with that system xD
[2:31:18] dutchie76: rate people lol
[2:31:19] warrenny: You lose score if you leave
[2:31:20] ohgodimsobad: back in the day on madden they had a DNF% for people who quit the game
[2:31:21] MakaiiART: a vote to end key and a penalty for leaving if it wasn't voted is all it needs
[2:31:22] daconcion: @dreamwalker213 I think they will be a lot more in line with each other, just a lot less burst damage from MM now is all
[2:31:23] Ardailec: That stuff doesn't even work in fighting games
[2:31:28] NBK_Sethus: techincally you don't have to penalize them, just record which and how many keys they abandon
[2:31:30] Aquadriel: should just NOT penalize key owners
[2:31:32] ohgodimsobad: and you  could set your search to avoid people with a certain %.
[2:31:34] Crizzle777: Had someone leave 10 min into it because we weren't going to time
[2:31:38] Ardailec: And that's where the "Leaver's score" was practically invented.
[2:31:53] dreamwalker213: @daconcion yeah for sure
[2:31:53] akia03: youll trap players in bad m+ grps
[2:32:05] Stagen: Those mythic stats thing you got on the screen, is that an addon or weak aura? What's that called?
[2:32:09] warrenny: They need somthing too many trolls
[2:32:14] dutchie76: imagine if you could quene with NPCs for dungeons lol
[2:32:29] fistofnature: just do what league does, 4 votes = group disband or if 1 leaves have 3 votes
[2:32:37] daconcion: Although reducing TS cd by 2.5s instead of 1.5s is gonna make TS nearly every pull, or at least every other pull now
[2:32:41] sdpercussion: depleted keys dont drop level. just dont give loot. ez
[2:32:43] enux337: queue for under 15
[2:32:47] MedicineMan: Morning all!
[2:32:51] daconcion: Fortified week especially
[2:32:57] NBK_Sethus: they record and show timed and depleted runs, do the same for leaving keys
[2:32:57] Crizzle777: can someone explain what it means to lust?
[2:33:00] archninja64: The solution is just to not downgrade a key when you fail.  The time spent/wasted is enough punishment.
[2:33:02] dutchie76: @daconcion yea that's what i was thinking
[2:33:17] dutchie76: @MedicineMan SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:33:21] MedicineMan: Don't send a restoSham to do a Priest's job. Kappa
[2:33:44] dreamwalker213: @daconcion yeah mm will be fine, just won’t burst as high on pull
[2:33:45] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[2:33:47] TheCliffyShow: Removing key depletion would be a good idea.
[2:33:51] flebbooo: @Crizzle777 There is a cd in the game that Shamans, hunters, evokers and mages get that increase everyone's haste for 30% but can only be used every 10 mins
[2:34:08] HopeThePriest: It is there just not doing it
[2:34:11] Crizzle777: thanks
[2:34:25] dreamwalker213: You still stack
[2:34:34] dandeneaux: I just joined but i think a good punishment for leaving keys is to downgrade that person's progression on the key they left. so if they time a 16 rpl and leave a rpl key the time would go down to a 14.
[2:34:35] dutchie76: i stack for tornados
[2:34:38] Molvonos: Eh, key depletion, I feel, serves the purpose of showing you, baseline, where you shouldn't be.  You still get loot if you complete it, and it shows up in your vault, but it puts you at a level where you can get proper gear that'll help you succeed.
[2:35:05] dutchie76: lol
[2:35:06] Scarhearth: No people just are afraid of stacking
[2:35:23] dutchie76: this boss dead yeat
[2:35:24] flebbooo: LUL
[2:35:51] smashwow: that change was made so they don't have to clear with the tank
[2:36:00] smashwow: that's just people not clearing period
[2:36:05] PvtHudson093: not a fan of this one
[2:36:05] blooodraine: 14 deaths yikes
[2:36:14] Sherm0: nokhud always feels so long ResidentSleeper
[2:36:16] warrenny: @dandeneaux Makeit a 10 and sure
[2:36:22] dreamwalker213: Yeah but they still need to clear with each other lol
[2:36:24] manmower: f them tanks
[2:36:32] smashwow: they were doing that before
[2:36:32] dutchie76: nokund is the longest
[2:36:37] dutchie76: by far
[2:36:40] smashwow: welcome to pug life
[2:36:49] MedicineMan: This place is bugged. I had the adds on the last boss get aggro during P1.  (Adds were immune, but can cause damage lol)
[2:36:49] lumaday: least fun affix since prideful imo
[2:36:55] dutchie76: but wait until the other 4 dungeons come out
[2:37:01] Sherm0: i dont like nokhud,
[2:37:02] MrCojo1: i havent seen pally gameplay in so long :(
[2:37:04] Sherm0: just takes to long
[2:37:26] dreamwalker213: @dutchie76 brackenhide is gonna the most aids key LUL
[2:37:28] thespudc1: Blizzard don't care, that's why firemage still sucks lol
[2:37:29] daconcion: Nokhud has so much downtime and differing routes that it's really hard to pug.
[2:37:38] Shenri: do you use plater @Towelliee ??
[2:37:41] SpidercowSD: What is the Catalyst going to take
[2:37:43] dutchie76: netherius will be bad too
[2:37:44] TheItalianStallion321: woot 8 weeks too late
[2:37:48] dutchie76: and halls of infusion
[2:37:48] Visuals66: More like "about fucking time you clowns!"
[2:37:52] Shenri: is that a custom profile?
[2:37:53] smashwow: we've been talking about the catalyst since beta when they said it was coming back.
[2:38:03] Kineticbomb: They do care but they care too late.
[2:38:19] MakaiiART: we have heard your feedback! (we being 12 steps down the communication ladder)
[2:38:30] reggiepowa: they dont agree with caralyst feedback though, they specifically want it to be catch up system not the main way to get tier
[2:38:31] thespudc1: just give fire mage a 30% damage buff and they'd be viable lol not this rubbish 5%
[2:38:34] dutchie76: i dont think they are finished with dungeon nerfs either
[2:38:42] heltvild: probably too much management and people that need to approve changes before it can go trough
[2:38:53] manmower: bad luck protection and alt catch up
[2:39:08] dutchie76: rock is there on purpose
[2:39:10] PvtHudson093: bring dinars back
[2:39:13] dutchie76: LUL
[2:39:19] daconcion: Dwayne "The rock" johnson is not a tool to used lightly
[2:39:49] Sherm0: the rock blocks the dmg?
[2:39:50] manmower: catalyst should come out 6 weeks after raid opening
[2:39:51] dutchie76: here comes the dmg
[2:40:07] TheGamerME: good sunday everyone. hows everyone doing this morning
[2:40:11] dutchie76: rip
[2:40:24] 3663Sharad: Or use CC
[2:40:27] dreamwalker213: Ouch
[2:40:30] PYRO_MANI8C: solo shuffle ques need fixed
[2:40:57] reggiepowa: @PYRO_MANI8C how do you fix them? ppl just don't like to play healers that much
[2:41:04] Sherm0: its oneshot isnt it?
[2:42:09] voyage_icarus: Guys im currently 2100+. What level dungeons do i need to complete for 2400? +20?
[2:42:13] reggiepowa: raid participation is already very low because of how much better m+ gearing is, if tier wasn't tied to raids it would be even lower
[2:42:19] SilkeySmooth: any m+ punishement will drive even more players away
[2:42:31] WoWPuggers: @Towelliee I agree dude, Leavers put me off mythic+ dungeons

[2:42:37] 3663Sharad: I'd guess a DC would counter the vote system
[2:42:37] daconcion: They can prevent people from posting lfg keys without an authenticator, they can figure out a way to prevent leavers from queueing into dungeons and bricking people's keys
[2:42:39] manmower: you don't want players policing themselves
[2:42:42] warrenny: Just add percentage completed keys
[2:42:46] 3663Sharad: since you didnt left the group
[2:43:01] MedicineMan: Season 1 is always the hardest. Because they still need to balance stuff
[2:43:13] manmower: just make tier sets cosmetic with no power
[2:43:17] Crizzle777: I want to raid, but can't find anyone to raid with
[2:43:44] mavericks312: @manmower they would get way to much backlash for that
[2:43:51] N3llee: I need keys brother .. hollar if you need dps

[2:45:54] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: towCopium
[2:45:59] Red_Dead_Redeem: them and the damn ragnaros players

[2:46:07] Quikbeard: Are you freaking guzzling these cracked out banger dungeons or what?
[2:46:10] CeruleanStar: lol right surprised they stayed after the first dobule pull
[2:46:11] Molvonos: We need an addon that perma blocks Azralon and Ragnaros servers, kinda like Block Chinese.

[2:46:25] DonNizzi: waow, AA is so bugged... we stuck on the bird thingy, and cant move on.. a small bird is bugged -.- rip key
[2:46:25] kajun_predator: don't invite anyone from Azralon/Ragnaros/Frostmourne
[2:46:31] kajun_predator: to do keys
[2:46:40] Scarhearth: azralon players for me tend to leave the second they die once

[2:52:48] reggiepowa: @Sithrath honestly spanish ppl have been worse in my experience

[2:52:52] jugshot: dat shadow damage
[2:52:53] manmower: the server probably just grows them in-house rather than funneling
[2:52:55] smashwow: most of the toxic servers in NA are the South America or OCE servers

[2:54:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Not ALL players are toxic on even the bad servers, just more than others tbf.
[2:54:43] reggiepowa: 15s seem to be 14s from previous expansions, can barely find any people who want to pug 15s

[4:07:35] Aidler: my current ranking: MoP, Legion, BfA, DF, Wrath, BC, Classic, Cata, WoD. DF of course preliminary
[4:07:37] UtherBrexton: think its a cage with 3 different mounts in it or something

[4:07:44] Reesessmack: a cage,a nd the cage can be different mounts

[5:00:49] TacDuc: Me and my mother were talking about ducks some time ago, and the next day she had ads for ducks on facebook
[5:00:50] Nuttballl: and where does data harvesting lead say 50 years down the road?
[5:00:51] capricore: and this is why skynet will destroy us
[5:00:52] Molvonos: YOU GOT A DOORBELL?  Data harvested.

[5:27:59] davey818: they are paying 500 dollars a month to heat their house
[5:27:59] Holysal: bc EU uses gold to buy tokes
[5:28:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, in EU more people buy the tokens with gold in game, in NA more people buy the tokens with real money in the store
[5:28:12] trevomancho: @Towelliee dont forget d4 is coming
[5:28:16] Holysal: NA buys tokens with cash
[5:28:22] Sylphy_TV: Wait til its 280k Towelliee, It will raise back up

[5:29:04] Poriand: so if WoW token is low does that mean alot of people are buying? explain lol
[5:29:39] quentinkil: hi how are you @Towelliee

[5:29:49] theluvjonze: I’m here for a mog roulette
[5:29:49] davey818: @davey818 sorry what do you call them? flats?
[5:29:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: If the WoW token is not worth as much gold, it means that a bunch of people are buying them in the shop with $ and not a lot are buying them in game with gold
[5:29:50] Loney143: Pants look AQish
[5:29:50] Aegllor: @Poriand Yeah. it fits the laws of supply and demand. more people buying means more available and that drives the price down.
[5:30:11] fistofnature: @Poriand its because not every player is selling a token, but a lot of players are willing to buy them for hold

[6:17:21] Pharaoh_326: you see rextroy 3 shot the world boss XD
[6:17:27] IchabodCrain: Warriors were the weakest tanks in shadowlands, now they reversed it hard the other way
[6:17:29] Autoexeq: Naowh at 200ilvl is still any random ass warrior at 350 ilvl so
[6:17:38] exilezor: only when you could play it in holland
[6:17:41] 3dRes: Do you have to pay for the roadmap?

[6:19:25] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: This raid is great besides the first boss for farming
[6:19:39] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: yes
[6:19:43] Autoexeq: yeah
[6:19:45] Autoexeq: unfortunately
[6:19:45] hammack52: they really should just have this gone and have all the loot on the second bos
[6:20:00] Epiclurker27893: Glad I completed by shortcut quest
[6:20:25] Masqerader: wtb siege skip
[6:20:50] Autoexeq: yeah. You need to have bandages to get Valithria in ICC if you don't have heals
[6:21:00] Plague_GG: Just use the unreal engine for WoW Kappa
[6:21:33] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 2 total
[6:21:35] Autoexeq: any side
[6:21:42] Autoexeq: just drop two and its done
[6:22:08] parlondo: Its glitchy as well, causing one to get stuck in combat. Making one unable to use the portals
[6:22:10] Frenaris: @Autoexeq you can skip her
[6:22:37] MrDakiris: She is the pilot of the second boss, so it would be weird to kill her there.
[6:22:42] BlackOTR: Happy Sunday Towelliee. Who you got on the Football games today?
[6:23:44] PvtHudson093: no faith in the cowboys
[6:23:45] sierrakia: Have you ever gotten head while playing WoW?
[6:23:48] Autoexeq: @Frenaris Yes, but if you want the drops you need bandages as like a warrior or rogue or whatever dont have heals
[6:23:48] Se7enthSinn: My Giants didnt show up last night
[6:24:14] Loney143: It is definitely more than 2
[6:24:39] Autoexeq: Maybe was 2 in heroic. my bad
[6:24:44] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: oh its 2 on heroic
[6:24:46] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: and normal
[6:25:04] Arocian: haha
[6:25:07] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: dont have to run mythic anymore since I have everything LUL
[6:25:19] valianya: @towelliee Can you collect tmog leather mail and cloth on a plate wearer or does it have to be the proper armor type to be saved to the account wide wardrobe?
[6:25:20] Frenaris: @Autoexeq yeah but most of her loot has duplicates on other bosses
[6:25:21] Autoexeq: same
[6:25:28] Pharaoh_326: back up
[6:25:37] Se7enthSinn: damn yo
[6:25:44] Pharaoh_326: the BOEs sell for decent gold
[6:25:48] Troniin: It was more like a giants beating yesterday lol
[6:25:49] Autoexeq: @Frenaris Still tho
[6:25:52] BlackOTR: The Eagles Murdered the Giants
[6:25:56] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @valianya proper armor class required
[6:25:59] Lupine_Fury: lol, you were calling it a 3-3 game at halftime
[6:26:00] AndyBoyLIVE: bills 4 the win
[6:26:10] BlackOTR: I got the Bills today
[6:26:27] protocols_: It depends if josh allen shows up
[6:26:32] Se7enthSinn: turnovers
[6:26:44] protocols_: i mean they should win especially with that cinci O line
[6:26:44] Torsin: theyre inconsistent but im rooting for them
[6:26:48] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Josh Allen throws random bad passes that turn into picks
[6:26:54] protocols_: the bills defense should tear them up
[6:27:13] CMack_72: Dissin' Josh Allen.  For shame.
[6:27:20] notn3w: Burrow is the only one that can beat Mahomes though
[6:27:23] protocols_: oh absolutely idk if bills win its by 3 or 5
[6:27:23] nitemare34godd: @towelliee not sure if you herd there is a new trailer for new mission impossible movie part 1
[6:27:28] protocols_: not by much
[6:27:30] BlackOTR: The Benglas are missing TOO Many offensive Linemen
[6:27:41] jetributions: what defense
[6:27:43] protocols_: giants didnt show up at all i was pissed lmfao
[6:27:49] geokouts: my team is losing 0-3 at the start of second half...
[6:27:56] beh0pper: Hurts too nice
[6:28:10] Troniin: Why do the Bills get this as a home game since they have the same record and the last game didnt get played?

[6:29:19] BlackOTR: Because of the Lamar Hamilton injury. So bills get home field
[6:30:01] geokouts: tbc
[6:30:32] geokouts: maybe you will get the legendary bow :P
[6:30:41] hammack52: speaking of wrath who thinks that there will be at least one wrath dungon next season for M+
[6:30:49] Troniin: you know what would be cool, if they repurposed Terrace of the Endless Spring into a m+ dungeon. Its small and I think would work well as a 5 man.

[6:32:09] Plague_GG: Thankfully you could port to the last 2 bosses
[6:32:13] Snabido: I'd say siege and hfc are about equal in that regard
[6:33:01] hammack52: i mean with HFC you are assualting a fortress so i would excpect alot of trash
