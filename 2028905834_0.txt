[2:17:54] SkumbagJacob: @Pikabooirl mind spike stacks 3x on EACH target for a long time each to 9x,  for the haste buff from pvp talent
[2:18:07] rogue_i95: press shadow word death everytime its up
[2:18:14] TimmyShoes: are you not dotting the healer cus the dots might break cc?
[2:19:00] SkumbagJacob: @Pikabooirl letting them kick and you getting mind spike on whoever doesn't ahve 3x mind trauma will give you haste to like 60% i think total. its A LOT.
[2:19:17] darthD3AN: dot all 3, advice you gave me
[2:20:07] Faintestedge: you faked like 10 kicks there

[2:25:34] Legosauruswrecks: i dont get the disperses

[2:26:37] Legosauruswrecks: GOTH EELS sounds better
[2:26:43] darthD3AN: lol hope it’s goth heals
[2:27:05] SkumbagJacob: @Pikabooirl mind trauma pvp talent stacks 9x, and the most youv'e ever gotten it is to 4x, cause 3x per target. That's all it really is for the haste at least. just letting you know.  <3 have a good one brotha.
