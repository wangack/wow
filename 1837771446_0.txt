In early September 2020, it was revealed that a port of the game created for the Nintendo Switch removed Mario's voice line from the battle with Bowser. Mario can be heard saying "So long, King Bowser" in an Italian accent, which many have misheard as the line "So long, gay Bowser." Gayge Stay tuned for more Gay facts!

[3:47:13] RockSquire: sodaDance sodaDance
[3:47:14] heymatt: lacking wbuffs doesnt make raids harder, it just makes bosses have bigger health pools effectively. mechanics are still the same.

[3:47:42] shaayynee: or atleast make it so you cant have multiple raid buffs... i feel like its fine if you randomly have dragonslayer buff just cuz you were there. but having multiple buffs is dumb
[3:47:43] creativename102: @sodapoppin Leveling with worldbuffs is fine cuz you have them up for 2hrs out of 1000 hrs of leveling, world buffs in raid are 2hrs/2hrs uptime

[3:48:29] dannnyj_: end game hardcore is a fcking boring joke

[3:49:36] heymatt: @heymatt you need a lot more than no wbuffs to make the raids harder. new mechanics. higher damage. something in the direction of SoM but more. no wbuffs will still be a faceroll
[3:49:37] 1Defense: Way too many addons in this game

[3:50:14] mukulukku: I didn't like world buffs because there were too powerful not to have them and getting them was just annoying
[3:50:16] Tereznic: I was memeing on peoples mindset a 100% safety guarenteed feature is dumb
[3:50:17] Swapzz_: I wish they would nerf content just enough to make WBs not neccessary
