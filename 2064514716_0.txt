[2:15:24] Rmont: so they are adding like structures to the world, questing, class halls for that mod with the 12 classes, new boss arenas and mini dungeons, etc.
[2:15:30] reborndevil96: gaming til sunday night basically
[2:15:43] LumberChopMan: @Rmont Think I saw something on this, is it the one put together/funded by a content creator?
[2:15:43] Rmont: they've been working on this for like a year

[2:16:02] Rmont: the map designs they are doing are crazy cool
[2:16:03] Topher_IRL: coughSkyrimcough
[2:16:12] GNR_SweetSkills: I worked a grocery store and someone dared to do the super troopers syrup chug, so I went to the syrup section and picked the one that looked the most liquidly which ended up being sugar free well I chugged the whole bottle but sugar free is made aspartame which is a natural laxative needless to say I was peeing out my butt the rest of my shift easy money lol
[2:16:37] Spyke_ZGZ: @GNR_SweetSkills You... fucking idiot. KEKW
[2:16:41] LumberChopMan: passion or frustration, something bugs you enough you fix it your self ha
[2:17:05] Spyke_ZGZ: Go look at the Sugar Free Haribo Gummy Bears reviews on Amazon
[2:17:06] Lusciousdan: It's so gross that they used real syrup in that scene, and did shot after shot after shot
[2:17:07] Spyke_ZGZ: Same thing
[2:17:12] reborndevil96: i just had a little discussion with my mom about card games in general and collectible stuff because i was watching a youtube video of somebody opening up 2 boxes of a collectors MTG set

[2:17:29] Lusciousdan: Yeah it took several takes
[2:17:41] LumberChopMan: @GNR_SweetSkills this is why sugar-free gummy bears have some wild reviews. People commenting about getting crazy shits after eating a bag of em and getting angry LUL
[2:17:41] whodoes__that: "I prefer syrup!" - Chris Rock. Look that up if you haven't seen it
[2:17:49] reborndevil96: i have stuff all the way back to 2012 still
[2:17:51] Lusciousdan: There wasn't really anything else they could use that was less gross so it was real syrup
[2:17:54] Topher_IRL: I have more unopened MTG and Pokemon TCG products than I'd like to admit
[2:17:54] StreamElements: They're obviously not Pokemons they're PALS!
[2:17:58] Topher_IRL: Some day my time will come!
[2:18:00] veska7L: hey if youre gonna chug syrup at least be healthy with sugar free right
[2:18:13] Spyke_ZGZ: The collectors/pack openers have ruined card games.
[2:18:15] GNR_SweetSkills: on the movie it was colored water not syrup
[2:18:21] Spyke_ZGZ: Signed, a bitter fucking CCG player
[2:18:33] Lusciousdan: I was pretty sure they said it was real in the commentary @GNR_SweetSkills
[2:18:37] LumberChopMan: I have unopened starter decks for the Jungle pokemon set
[2:18:37] StreamElements: They're obviously not Pokemons they're PALS!

[2:18:58] primal_drop: ayo why are we complaining about the review i left about the gummy bears?
[2:18:59] Topher_IRL: I don't have any from Jungle but I still have some base set, Fossil, Gym Leaders 1
[2:19:05] Lusciousdan: Apparently they started with water/iced tea but it didn't look right so they had to use real syrup and do more takes
[2:19:06] Spyke_ZGZ: That's why sugar free is better. You don't get any sugar AND you shit everything else out.
[2:19:13] reborndevil96: yeah Holo charizard from the original base set goes for anywhere between 90$-500$ and the pack itself unopened goes for 440$ now
[2:19:13] GNR_SweetSkills: @primal_drop LUL

[4:29:19] Spyke_ZGZ: If you can't be confident in your ganks, don't do it. Just git gud.
[4:30:18] Topher_IRL: I still think about that day a Warrior jumped me mid AoE-pull and I just kited him into my pack, hit a Nova and then just Blizzard him down with the rest of the mobs
[4:30:19] Topher_IRL: LUL
[4:30:49] Spyke_ZGZ: Oh that's like the Troll Hunter who tried to feign death me into a pack the other day. Simply tanked it, waited for him to try and run and bubbled aggro right back.
