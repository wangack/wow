[0:07:54] devilhawk83: I uses a Ryzen 5800X3D and it runs WoW really good along using a RTX 4070 as well
[0:09:04] devilhawk83: Yep
[0:09:31] MfamBOOtie: i spent 2200 i have Dell 34 Curved Gaming Monitor â€“ S3422DWG with 7800 and 3800 ti
[0:09:34] Artiiz: Shadow priest part of the meta again with the buffs?
[0:09:50] MfamBOOtie: Spriest is great!
[0:10:07] devilhawk83: You can get a lot of deals on used GPUs and even the prices of the previous generation Radeon GPU are pretty good value now
[0:11:52] Svesno: No Palworld gameplay?
[0:12:07] devilhawk83: If I decides to upgrade, it is probably going to be in the next 4 years
[0:15:04] devilhawk83: My most important advice I give to anyone getting or building a new PC is always invest in a good power supply as that is the most important component for your system
[0:15:18] MfamBOOtie: i use tree, is the best!
[0:15:36] MfamBOOtie: i use tree + 45 second tree
[0:15:43] MfamBOOtie: because Pugs
[0:15:54] Ark1G: PugDance
[0:16:06] Svesno: @devilhawk83 Which is the best manufacturer atm btw?
[0:17:20] bugab00s: its time for keys to stop scaling damage beyond 25s
[0:17:36] MfamBOOtie: Cap
[0:18:21] rydon96: what did you work as before you were a streamer
[0:18:44] MfamBOOtie: fOR Psu i look at what Corp makes it, lots of time cheaper PSU are made by the same corp
[0:19:31] Cervantas: power suoplies are fairly universal, buy a good one and it it can last forever
[0:19:33] lucid_wow: @perkkuheppu ref doesnt make awful calls = u dont notice psu doesnt fuck up ur system = u dont notice
[0:19:40] lucid_wow: it makes sense
[0:19:41] tabxzer: @rydon96 he was selling insurance and hotdogs sometimes both at same time
[0:19:51] devilhawk83: Corsair, Seasonic or EVGA. But I suggest do your research and look up sites that does PSU testing like Hardware Busters as Aris is very thought and his testing is Top tier as he was the one that actually point out the exploding Gigabyte PSUs before Gamers Nexus broke it out @svesno
[0:19:54] xoxo__x6: why do you skilled tranq
[0:20:30] Svesno: I remember times when cases where supplied with PSUs. I had Antec case and PSU for long time
[0:21:32] tumbro: hi mr dot b what are your thoughts on aug evokers? :)
[0:21:42] rydon96: just play MW ?
[0:22:16] TBouse: More mastery would help
[0:22:20] loeamagicy: Hi
[0:22:39] loeamagicy: Hey there
[0:22:55] MfamBOOtie: remember if you use trees on command, your cd goes down to 2 minutes
[0:23:39] boatdong: have you seen any good spriests around? looks like they are pumping now
[0:23:51] TBouse: The downside of this build is your lifebloom basically does rejuv healing
[0:24:56] MfamBOOtie: i got a question boss, Why not cultivation? if is that bad? that would be raw 8% more healing
[0:25:02] TBouse: What does it tick for compared to your rejuv atm
[0:25:52] kristin199302: !drops
[0:29:37] TBouse: Double dragons on fall is the only sort of similar thing
[0:29:50] TBouse: Not that similar though
[0:30:52] tabxzer: its the third aoe right? where its overlapping?
[0:31:25] HeIIaAverage: What pull we talking about?
[0:31:28] tabxzer: what healer has it easier in ur opinion?
[0:31:44] TBouse: No swarms either
[0:31:50] caradea_: also swarms are gone
[0:32:06] HeIIaAverage: The last trash in rise?
[0:32:07] Nico_vdM: interrupts disappear from the dps' actionbars once you reach that part of the dungeon
[0:32:12] Wrighter16: This is big true.
[0:33:36] Razzeu: FeelsOkayMan unlucky, my cds are ready
[0:33:58] HeIIaAverage: That's my experience across the board. Tanks get anxious and they rush when they don't need to.
[0:35:27] Nico_vdM: If Deios had less health, maybe
[0:35:53] tumbro: Aware
[0:36:32] tumbro: it feels like that pack fucks a lot harder than the double after first boss
[0:38:08] joffrey0101: yes to me this is the big difference, people pull this like if everyone had every cds
[0:39:03] lazylad02: hello Jb

[1:03:04] Wujoh: jdotb would you raid rwf
[1:03:08] dotbotter: did your vision get better kayo? some say it actually improves vision, not only stops the disease
[1:03:13] teqlamage: I love when I push all week, finish no  keys, and then have to do 8 weeklies <3
[1:03:15] Kayozay_: Anywho, it doesn't solve the eye problem, just makes it from getting worse.
[1:03:39] dithrica: @teqlamage feel that in my soul
[1:03:45] Kayozay_: My vision has SLIGHTLY improved, but has not got worse at all
[1:03:58] dotbotter: do you wear sclerals?
[1:04:00] ArkusTV: @jdotb where are you currently living? I thought you played on US

[1:09:42] apertured_wizard: idk about being a bigger nerd than you but i have a soft spot for TES- even got a tattoo of daedric runes from skyrim
[1:10:29] Nico_vdM: I think most people were introduced to TES by either Skyrim or Oblivion
[1:10:39] kelly_mac06: @Nico_vdM agreed
[1:10:54] apertured_wizard: 100% skyrim was such a hit
[1:11:03] kelly_mac06: man oblivion was so great. i played the shit out of it when i was pregnant
[1:11:23] apertured_wizard: funny enough todd howard was the director for morrowind and oblivion though so they have similar energy
[1:11:24] kelly_mac06: i actually never played skyrim tho, but my son loves it
[1:11:31] Zippiie_: do you not like fall?
[1:11:40] kelly_mac06: @apertured_wizard oh wow i didn't know that
[1:11:46] apertured_wizard: oblivion is fantastic
[1:12:52] Zippiie_: fall is one of my favorites but to be fair, im not a healer
[1:13:49] Wujoh: skyrim is my favourite game of all time easioly
[1:13:54] apertured_wizard: skyrim is my comfort game, i go back to it once or twice a year when wow gets slow

[1:53:12] KembriaTV: It's not counted as a tertiary on the pants
[1:53:18] keenxp: that's fucked up
[1:53:21] Hayotal: Yo! Whats your opinion on skipping ysera's and grove tending, for nature's swiftness buff into regrowth crit ?

[3:32:32] Veith91: @jdotb yo jb i dont have rageheart. which trinkets would u take ? suncaller+leaf?
[3:32:56] Veith91: why no leaf?
[3:33:06] Veith91: what about vessel?
[3:33:22] MarkyMark9191: voodoo totem ever applicable in certain weeks/dungeons?
[3:33:45] Veith91: leaf because of mastery ?
[3:33:45] vickmantwo: It's pretty decent honestly
[3:33:56] KembriaTV: I heard people used it on morchie in Fall
[3:33:58] vickmantwo: Fixes lack of spot healing for shit like debuffs in fall for example
[3:34:01] KembriaTV: But haven't seen it
[3:34:17] Blackgoose25: vessel is insane, I swear I dont remember it being this good in BFA
[3:34:27] vickmantwo: Nah, not morchie, tainted sands/chronoburst, and random  other mechanics
[3:34:38] MarkyMark9191: considering my options for my non vessel trinket are ashes of the embersoul and music box, I stick with voodoo totem
[3:35:15] 0_____Kappa: vessel does like 9-11% for me usually monkaHmm
[3:35:18] vickmantwo: leaf/suncallers, lead/vessel, suncallers/tainted heart, tainted heart vessel are most options
[3:35:41] vickmantwo: Or vodoo doll instead of vessel if you wanna play safe
[3:35:44] Veith91: suncaller/genesauer blood?
[3:35:59] vickmantwo: you can, but if no leaf, probably vodoo doll at that point honestly
[3:36:07] vickmantwo: crit proc is w/e
[3:36:11] Jogiboio: Yo , can i see healing breakdown? my regrowth usually towers over everything when i do pugs and it dont feel righ

[3:38:07] vickmantwo: Is only my details cursed and doesn't not combine lifeblooms? Smadge
[3:38:39] vickmantwo: Yours doesn't combine them either, some friends don't either, mine combines it under the arrow feature nourish/swiftmend have
[3:38:50] vickmantwo: And I don't want it to
[3:39:31] Jogiboio: how is your treeants so high? do i have to combine it with something?
[3:39:45] YdenTV: @vickmantwo you can uncheck "merge spells with same name" or delete the lifebloom entry in that section and it will unmerge them.
[3:39:59] vickmantwo: @YdenTV Interesting, which section is that?
[3:40:15] YdenTV: Options Panel -> Rename Spells at the bottom
[3:40:19] EshWoW: Yo JD you're the man
