[1:22:57] JtPacks: @cLEEan_SIN in retail you can play the DoT rogue assassination spec for PVP, but in classic you will most likely be using instant attacks or pistol shot spec for PVP, not very many DoTs because they can break some of your crowd control abilities like blind
[1:22:58] Sebleh: Yeh it's messed up. It's showing boss 2 split but they're killing boss 3

[3:10:38] STFNxdd: @moderatygos A Question on that, if a team does something, not accepted yet by admins, and lose by it, can admins then accept it later, so it can be used in future runs?

[5:03:33] HeySpacecamp: @ruttoluikero Resto shaman and rogue in this very dungeon earlier today
[5:03:35] tettles: yeah on retail there are a lot of different strats and most people play their "mains"
[5:03:50] tettles: on this youre going for the absolute fastest strat, so it consolidates potential comps pretty hard

[5:05:51] oatpleb: Is there a moratorium on the word "setting" now? Suspiciously, casters seem to avoid it completely, when it used to be a favourite word.

[5:07:51] tettles: @Sinaa Rdruid is slightly more ST damage which is the most important thing

[6:18:44] TickGames: do we think anyone lets Echo run Rise in the finals?
[6:19:05] KodyNM: @tettles but why they dont summon the priest? xD
[6:19:05] Moobot: Keep up with highlights during MDI on the Raider.IO coverage page: https://rio.gg/MDIDF3Coverage
[6:19:30] WingsofCrap: @TickGames im sure echo has something else cooked up for other dungeons that they havent shown
[6:19:34] tettles: not rlly sure
[6:19:36] tettles: time loss?
[6:19:54] osiris_7: Maybe just the RP timing of Morchie
[6:20:01] Eploar: 200k? Jeeebus
[6:20:09] Kamidamaru: surely it takes more time to create a stone and get it clicked and accepted than just 1 death
[6:20:14] wesleydungan: Was the priest still in combat when they did the summons?
[6:20:17] out_of_kek: a few secs of summon vs. just releasing after fight
[6:20:22] Zyliea: @Eploar split between all teams in globals
[6:20:30] dea7tth_: is this the only MDI for the year or there is supposed to be another one ?
[6:20:34] raddian21: tanks have way too much self healing
[6:20:51] Nidalee55: it takes like 5 seconds to summon and they're ticking down their active summon
[6:20:52] Zyliea: @dea7tth_ every season
[6:20:56] Eploar: @Zyliea That's still quite a hefty amount of money, at least where I come from.
[6:20:57] olivoilolja: Global final should be 500k price pool lol
[6:21:00] moderatygos: ggs today, lots of close maps and big competition
[6:21:01] TickGames: @dea7tth_ Group A was last week, the top 4 from each group go to the grand finals in 2 weeks.
[6:21:26] dea7tth_: @TickGames i know im asking ab the whole tournament
[6:21:33] Eploar: See you 2morrow
[6:21:48] Zyliea: @Eploar yeah, 5k per person is nice i guess lol 8 teams with 5 players and 200k
