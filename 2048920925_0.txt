[0:53:10] EdgeWalker69: No mo sub only! MingLee
[0:53:12] Fabian: The leader idiot blames the follower idiots for his stress SMH
[0:53:21] streets1111: Why do you allow yourself to get stressed out by random chatters ?
[0:53:31] Fabian: Just cus I've kissed men when I was young and drunk doesn't make me gay
[0:53:37] mighty_smiter: @0w3n__ Yeah, I drive. *Nightcall plays*

[0:54:18] Fabian: Why would I want to name 10 of either?
[0:54:37] 1neff4ble: @TommyKayLIVE since you are a rap fan, do you think Nas is the most influential rapper OAT?
[0:54:41] Fabian: Whenever you drive to Katowice
[0:54:49] taiscronqvist: hell yea
[0:54:49] streets1111: Yea but if you cared about us, you wouldn't insult us since we are retards
[0:54:51] mighty_smiter: tommy wants to wrestle a gay man???

[0:55:59] GgFt4: or its bc you're playing wow
[0:56:02] 1neff4ble: I meant it not about bringing stuff to the hip hop world, but rather influential to the next generations of rappers. Pretty much every rapper that came after Nas has sampled him, sound like him, take bars from him, so on
[0:56:11] Fabian: Only mods can do that you fucking idiot
[0:56:18] niotic1312: i made some honey with lemon orange and mango syrup wakes me up instantly in the morning

[0:58:02] 1neff4ble: @deformed_dude i guess, i'm not a classic production fan. But if Bach is not the most famous classic producer but all more popular producers than him would be scared of him and constantly call him goat and are inspired by him, then yeah

[1:00:35] the_sober_historian: Conservative government fucked it last decade @TommyKayLIVE
[1:00:42] Fabian: The currency in convertion doesn't matter at all
[1:00:45] mighty_smiter: @1neff4ble Bulgaria doesn't use the euro?
[1:01:07] echolaguna: @Fabian ofc it matters, a lot of goods, travel etc is related to $
[1:01:20] mighty_smiter: @the_sober_historian all currencies are fucked atm
[1:01:21] Rot_Zot: When comes the TommyDollar ?
[1:01:24] niotic1312: @deformed_dude nope bulgaria and romania arent in eurozone
[1:01:24] 1neff4ble: @deformed_dude no but we are sadly moving towards it cuz our politicians prefer to steal euros instead of steal levs and turn it to euros
[1:01:25] Fabian: Only machine I'm controlling is your moms vibrating buttplug via my phone
[1:01:26] mighty_smiter: we have a global recession

[1:09:27] 1neff4ble: @TommyKayLIVE he is saying that the currency doesn't matter but buying power, and the currency loses buying power when more of the currency is printed and prises go up, which is known as inflation. But he probably doesn't know that if the dollar gets  printed evey currency loses value

[1:36:28] 1neff4ble: obviously no text is better

[1:39:09] OldNosay: OldNosay subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:39:12] 1neff4ble: no text, it's clapped
[1:39:20] hcmraven: Depends on how you wanna sell it
[1:39:27] 1neff4ble: ugly
[1:39:30] H4Hollow: british slang
[1:39:37] puxafreitas: Best decisions are made when calm
[1:39:42] Mike_420: technologically illiterate KEKW
[1:39:45] Woody_Mate: really like the no text
[1:39:46] Lonelywolfski: "Supply is everything"

[1:41:33] vacerss: is he okay? KEKW
[1:41:36] Rot_Zot: Is hecuuming ?
[1:41:43] Woody_Mate: no text saves the hassle of having to explain the meme to randoms
[1:41:45] hcmraven: Is that guy drunk?
[1:42:02] H4Hollow: the youtube gremlins will probably buy it with text tbh
[1:42:10] Marceloossss: i dont know like when you look at previous shirts the simplicity is great it feels like premium products
[1:42:14] Mike_420: I mean just imagine having to explain a hoi4 meme to someone that doesn't get it
[1:42:24] hcmraven: Like they know what a supply box is
[1:42:28] bogi944: @hcmraven yeah right tommykLUL
[1:42:43] Amperspitz: only the text that is necessary

[1:44:05] Mike_420: Only text no image Kappa
[1:44:53] 1neff4ble: skill issue :(
[1:45:12] capricious_capybara: imagine earning over 100k /yr and not being able to crop out a picture
[1:45:15] MaxWeeman: cant you just get the image in memory with cheat engine then export it?
[1:45:35] listrong7: Yea you could put logo near the label inside as an easter egg of some sort and just put the text in hoi4 font
[1:45:42] GeminiRedheart: @MaxWeeman just steal assets? KEKW ?
[1:45:43] The_Yazoo: who wouldn't wear the Abdul shirt to a club
[1:45:56] MaxWeeman: @MaxWeeman Croping is not stealing or what KEKW
[1:46:04] 1neff4ble: bro thinks tommy is 20 Kappa
[1:46:07] Mike_420: Abdul shirt is a magnet for bitches for sure
[1:46:15] hcmraven: Which cas picture again?
[1:46:40] Mike_420: CAS Air mission icon?
[1:46:52] Amperspitz: true that
[1:46:57] Amperspitz: just put the text on
[1:47:00] HortTheHoarder: Maybe for the CAS logo text design you could draw inspiration from world war II nose art?
[1:47:03] MaxWeeman: just look for the image on here https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Category:Images_%C2%A9_Paradox&filefrom=Generic+air+manufacturer+2.png
[1:47:32] hcmraven: The one where you see how much damage they do? @TommyKayLIVE
[1:47:40] hcmraven: in the air mode?
[1:47:40] Mike_420: ye maybe use the search field you ADHD
[1:48:06] TheBjornen: All the hoi4 pictures exist in the hoi4 folder
[1:48:09] The_Yazoo: a lot are in the game files
[1:48:19] Foxx_1111: @TommyKayLIVE  there is aa cas icon on that site, 5th lowest row to the left
[1:48:23] milkiiya: do u already have a t-shirt manufacturer or looking for one? let me know if u want 1, i make tshirts in thailand.
[1:48:26] TheBjornen: I think the cas one tho is super tiny
[1:48:29] Foxx_1111: @TheBjornen but they are very bad quality
[1:48:44] Bence9811: but the question is when will you be rank 1 in league
[1:48:56] The_Yazoo: @Bence9811 no one cares
[1:49:10] Bence9811: oh, I see he is mad KEKW

[1:51:25] kikos123123: use air supriority symbol with 'cas is king' text
[1:51:26] Foxx_1111: @TommyKayLIVE  i sent you a picture on discord, it is a mio icon but is a CAS
[1:51:51] TheBjornen: I sent you some other hoi4 ones
[1:51:53] TheBjornen: They tiny
[1:52:17] hcmraven: All of them are so tiny
[1:52:19] Tunson: https://imgupscaler.com/
[1:52:21] oivaBork: you can make someone recreate the mfor higher resolution
[1:52:24] capricious_capybara: ai upscale the picture from the gamefile and u gucci
[1:52:43] Tunson: I just sent a link of an ai upscaler
[1:53:06] kikzou: ooh chat is not on sub only anymore, yeassay i'm back
[1:53:14] wolfpoops: someone can just take this and upscale it by hand in illustrator, done it a couple times before
[1:53:16] Smiley2k2: Is this about the new merch?
[1:53:23] GeminiRedheart: You need to make your own version, you cant just straight up rip an asset from a game and then just print it on a t-shirt
[1:53:28] H4Hollow: i think u should have the bomb with it
[1:53:29] 1neff4ble: the t-shirt would need to be white in order for the color to lok nice. Ligth blue and black don't look good together
[1:54:05] Rot_Zot: I want Abdullaziz riding the Bomb of the CAS into a supplydepot Tshirt pls
[1:54:10] kikzou: do a missile silo t shirt pogu hahaha
[1:54:31] bogi944: I guess it's the coffe you drink night time

[1:55:07] bogi944: don't drink coffee late and you good
[1:55:37] hcmraven: If i sleep more or less 7h i am fucked
[1:56:06] hcmraven: Excited for Merch
[1:56:19] Pind0o: how do i call the chatters in your chat?
[1:56:23] bogi944: @hcmraven i need 9 hours sleep with 7 hours im so tired tommykLUL
[1:56:46] Pind0o: GOODAFTERNOON RETARDS
[1:56:50] kikzou: can't u hire someone to take care of all ur merch thing ? idk if it would be worth it
[1:56:53] hcmraven: AI?
[1:56:54] Pind0o: BillyApprove
[1:56:57] Herooo31: ai upscale
[1:57:00] hero_of_zagros: Hey tommy
[1:57:05] uplockk: 2 hour wow Aware
[1:57:06] capricious_capybara: he lets chat work for free
[1:57:12] Dreadnought628: @TommyKayLIVE paradox can likely get you the high res images
[1:57:59] QuiteHornet67: with someone thats actually nestled in the community it might be worth it, merch is an insane income if you get it right
[1:58:10] aulion_valtteri: just hire some illustrator dude to literally copy the design to higher resolution
[1:58:22] bogi944: Can ChatGPT improve the quality maybe there is someone with the premium edition here in chat?
[1:58:26] kikzou: there sure must be an artist in ur community who knows u and the dommykay community that could make some nice drawings no ?
[1:59:24] 1neff4ble: it's a tax deduction, that's why they ask for so much money. Most companies would rather spent an unrealistic price on design and take the tax deduction than pay less.
[1:59:52] jdcro89: i dont think it was in vanilla
[2:00:03] stefos1985: tbc i think
[2:00:23] kikzou: i had a 30 sec ad, did he respond to my msg ? sorry ppl
[2:00:24] jdcro89: imagine mass dispel with living bomb
[2:00:49] GeminiRedheart: wont you need to create a concept and have an artist re-draw it anyway? You can't just rip an asset and print it on a shirt.
[2:01:25] hcmraven: What is the plan today?
[2:02:53] Ben1xol: Hoi4 today?
