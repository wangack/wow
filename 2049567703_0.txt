[0:15:11] spittyfps: Hey Yumy, idk if you answer questions, but im a H Priest but struggle to notice debuffs when using HealBot as not all them appear on the addon, is there anything you recommend to supplement this or a way about it?

[0:34:20] zachl_: @vanche219 i think it will be better than u think, dorki wont settle for mediocracy
[0:34:40] HarveyPls: @vanche219 u mean on live? no way tr has been open for 3 weeks
[0:34:41] Tonikor: But even then, everyone running through is much faster than one guy immuning through and activating port, that cast takes forever
[0:34:52] vanche219: seems like streamer priv seems real, dorki never not has the tournament realm too im not calling out just eu that was rude of me
[0:35:21] vanche219: @vanche219 drohgoh has said that teams have been practicing for 2.5-3 weeks TR 14 hour days already

[1:19:08] njokkio: How often do you use feather for others? I'm just a scrub but for me it basically already is a personal movement ability

[1:41:12] anaya909: oo duh
[1:42:00] baseboned: maybe the fyrakk nerfs broke the game
[1:42:18] pl0de: my game patched not too long ago after I logged out maybe that might fix something
[1:42:46] BigHellsOG: Blizzard fired the guy that kept the server stable
[1:43:53] anaya909: how would people feel about gear not having fixed stat values.  so there would be some variance in the rolls
[1:44:23] jenkinsdonuttv: Damn, yesterday I got a myth chest with avoidance, and now I just looted a hero cloak with avoidance. My luck will run out soon xdd
[1:44:30] anaya909: that would be exciting af though
[1:44:35] harmless52: do that but turn the drop rate up
[1:44:44] anaya909: yeah i'd imagine people would hate it.  i'm just used to it as an arpg player
[1:45:10] RamblingJosh_: You get gear so much slower in WoW, hard to farm out good rolls
[1:45:21] Eyir_: farming a dungeon 30 times for bis piece and it lowrolls
[1:45:29] RokMF: why do ur ranged not stand here
[1:45:46] anaya909: oh they'd for sure have to help with farming for certain items
[1:45:48] n0s0upbr0: THEYRE POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY - get THEM OUT

[1:46:51] sorenkje: Bedge
[1:47:12] n0s0upbr0: does anyone have a problem with what I said or do they all realize what‚Äôs realy going on
[1:47:35] vanche219: @baseboned blizzard has never lied before
[1:47:48] baseboned: wtf are you talking about this is a wow stream
[1:47:56] anaya909: there were spots in halls of atonement that would block los on dwarves/gnomes
[1:48:05] sorenkje: gnome model still swimming in dht in the area between 2nd 3rd boss
[1:48:07] njokkio: @baseboned have they really said that, because if so I want them to sell me bridges too so I don't have to fucking swim in dht
[1:48:09] anaya909: just those little brick circles around the shards
[1:48:48] zachl_: time for the weekly 7tv scrool
[1:49:01] baseboned: Growl told a story that wow devs said to his face that models didn't change anything, I think back when he and dorki did mdi not sure on details

[1:52:45] baseboned: I think max is an interesting case. about half the time I think his takes are solid and insightful, and about half the time I disagree but I understand and respect his position, but sometimes rarely he says something that completely unhinged
[1:53:21] zachl_: @n0s0upbr0 damnnnnnn wtf that sounds lit
[1:53:28] n0s0upbr0: @baseboned yeah I‚Äôm the opposite if max tells me anything about m+ I‚Äôm leaving his channel and asking someone that actually has gone through the m+ trenches

[1:55:59] vanche219: @baseboned none of the fancy ones in my small town, just locally owned courses have ranges
[1:56:01] zachl_: real shit golf courses have to be  expensive for entry otherwise the courses go to shit Shruge

[3:31:00] Chrissingr: xdd
[3:31:29] HarveyPls: do you think a dispel prio WA for manifested timeways would be good? i could make something simple like tankiest classes from top to bottom with an option for healer always first
[3:31:40] HarveyPls: but it would mean everyone having it and shit
[3:31:51] khonshush: !vuhdo
[3:31:51] Nightbot: I use Vuhdo for frames, you can find my exports here: https://linktr.ee/yumytv (warning: vuhdo sucks if you aren't good with addons)

[3:32:03] ritsrawr: dude earlier we wiped at the end of BRH because we lost the RNG lottery on darkness.... whole group got one shot lol. We went again quick and timed... but i was mad lol
[3:33:01] yifors: @Jabronie_808 how to heal with your class, when do bosses do dmg, when does trash do dmg, i think it's a good order to focus on if you don't feel confident with your healing
[3:33:03] greenpy: @Jabronie_808 its just another rota tho, you get accostumed to it
[3:33:07] zachl_: poke playing valorant and growl playing wow.... peak content

[4:04:02] Linith_Heart: i ran a 23 key that wasnt time due to tank pulling 2 mobs at a time, it was wild
[4:04:11] patymac: this song is a banger catJAM

[4:07:21] reedsworld: what if they added a mdi type title for live? that be kinda dope
[4:08:37] HarveyPls: are shields not reduced by the 50% debuff on the 2nd witch here?
[4:08:41] colombianpotato7: damn MoP challenge mode, thats a throwback
[4:11:11] ewbrad: do you think aug has made the game better or worse?
[4:12:41] ewbrad: would you wanna see more of those support specs?
[4:13:28] ewbrad: would be cool to see specs like offensive supports and stuff like GW2
[4:13:42] probablydaz: No idea why they made healing hard AF and then gave shamans massive mana issues lul
[4:13:51] gelth: I think they should just make healers somewhat more support ... not to the point of not being healers but, make healing easier and give healers more aug-type utility
[4:14:18] gelth: seems like the game has been low on healers all expac
[4:14:24] Chiefomatic: Morning chat & streamer uhmhiii
[4:14:26] probablydaz: I think every healer just needs access to decent externals.
[4:14:33] IAmSolari: @ewbrad aug Aware
[4:14:41] FriendlyLich: I think they should just delete healers, thoughts?
[4:15:23] cieriana: Growl - how do you deal with the mana drain on Disc Priest?
[4:15:38] probablydaz: That's also very true
[4:15:38] IAmSolari: male healers tankier
[4:15:50] gelth: everything is wild bc the outplay is technically there... makes sense
[4:15:52] njokkio: Dps being tanky makes healing harder
[4:15:54] IAmSolari: *make
[4:16:52] FriendlyLich: @njokkio thats why I say delete healers and problem solved
[4:16:55] SCMSV: peepoHappy watched your 8 hour mega episode of Zero to KSM over the past few days
[4:18:04] probablydaz: Delete every cheat death from the game tbh
[4:18:08] cieriana: bad luck on druid
[4:18:52] lbmad13: @probablydaz Too much self healing across all classes.
[4:19:44] njokkio: At a basic level, the groups survival is the healers responsibility, but with all defensives dps have, the healer doesn't always have agency over the groups survival, and responsibility without agency feels bad
[4:20:04] professor_cullman: wtf is this boss
[4:20:06] probablydaz: Rng boss mechanic
[4:20:17] timmyteat: growl not used to the tank asking for permission
[4:20:17] zachl_: it also creates a toxic meta where ur healer is focused on keeping themselves alive more than anything ^^
[4:20:46] IAmSolari: Still cant believe you played an entire raid tier in a tmsean guild in 2023/2024, you're better than this growl, you're a beast
[4:20:49] HarveyPls: my external is a personal GIGACAT
[4:21:13] dhezghia: @yumytv now i just have myth track ring with avoidance, do you know any1 that wants
[4:21:24] IAmSolari: motivational speech done
[4:21:39] dhezghia: no
[4:21:41] dhezghia: i bought it before
[4:21:43] dhezghia: but never used
[4:22:01] gigawatersoaker7777: All these millions of incoming damage and still not as scary and intense as killing 3 mobs in hc
[4:22:26] Klon_____: Deadge
[4:24:12] yctnm: when a dungeon boss has your dps buying pvp trinket off the ah Despairge
[4:24:13] greenpy: oh shit the trinket strat now, its getting serious
[4:24:23] Nex_Healer: its like 1k honor for the trinket
[4:24:24] Slapsstick: medallion i think
[4:24:39] Linith_Heart: the healer i play with refuses to learn damage patterns and ramps even when there is no damage going out, how can i help him?
[4:24:54] Nex_Healer: @Linith_Heart Find a new healer
[4:25:07] Linith_Heart: constantly running out of mana and drinking
[4:25:34] totesnotbore: big io tonight or what
[4:25:44] probablydaz: Honestly yeah they probably don't like healing they like hitting buttons it sounds like
[4:25:44] Tarithal: Jigglin
[4:25:51] khonshush: @Linith_Heart tell them to play resto instead
[4:25:52] greenpy: just dont die buh
[4:26:04] IAmSolari: @Linith_Heart you can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink
[4:26:14] totesnotbore: i got my wcm today on 30 im never going back
[4:26:21] totesnotbore: ballsack of a key
[4:26:30] Linith_Heart: @Linith_Heart they do, and reso seems like the worst class to do it on lol
[4:26:37] totesnotbore: oh fuck thats cursed
[4:26:51] totesnotbore: now that is massively troll
[4:26:53] HarveyPls: @Linith_Heart idk if this is applicable here but most of this is when they dont have the info given to them by their ui, watch them play andd see
[4:27:00] totesnotbore: hahah our sales we got a bunch
[4:27:01] IAmSolari: I actually pushed keys myself this week, that's how piss it is
[4:27:04] HarveyPls: like no spell cds on nameplates WA bad boss timers and shit
[4:27:05] totesnotbore: didnt brick but it was mayhem
[4:27:06] whiskeyhide: i dc'd in ataldazar
[4:27:08] Chrissingr: yeah there was a lot of weird lag earlier
[4:27:24] keishoru: Sorry if this was already asked, but how do you meet people to play m+ with? Try to meet people in pugs who play well and add them? I've been struggling to play bcuz playing without a team is really boring
[4:27:42] IAmSolari: volcanic spiteful next week too holy fuck I'm gonna bust
[4:27:54] jaredxn94: GivePLZ
[4:28:11] greenpy: ask in trade chat to get the real gamers
[4:28:13] probablydaz: @keishoru yeah just add people or find a guild/discord to play in
[4:28:32] Chrissingr: we're all hanging out at the toy shop in wrath dalaran
[4:29:00] imjebb: all the good m+ players are hiding in the middle of the tram track to ironforge
[4:29:00] shikiyoku5: !mdi
[4:29:09] IAmSolari: there aren't many ass weeks of m+ left
[4:29:09] Chewbaccaw: career wow players
[4:29:53] Surefirexp: Dorki time trials going well???
[4:30:06] IAmSolari: this is probably the best tyran week left though
[4:31:58] IAmSolari: storming/raging is the next tyran week, followed by incorp/spiteful, followed by volcanic sanguine
[4:32:50] kitty0chi: morning growl
[4:33:15] nahrniarcg: get gabbing or get going
[4:33:46] Canwestop: !civcheck
[4:33:46] Nightbot: Canwestop is 59% civilian.
[4:34:32] IAmSolari: 8 weeks left of the season right?
[4:34:45] Theliahh: nobody knows
[4:34:56] Theliahh: but april is a good guess
[4:35:00] baseboned: i bet its more than 8 weeks
[4:35:26] nahrniarcg: its more like 10-12 weeks
[4:35:31] IAmSolari: I'm ngl I like this season so I don't mind
[4:35:59] nahrniarcg: i like this season as well. i just want them to nerf one shot mechanics and its going to be way better
[4:36:03] IAmSolari: first time I'm really enjoying pushing keys this expac
[4:36:20] baseboned: I'm pretty checked out personally, most of of my buds quit playing
[4:36:45] IAmSolari: F

[4:40:57] IAmSolari: good concept by blizzard blizzarded it
[4:41:09] HarveyPls: man fuck me for having a bad opinion but having your big dam when thundering damage amp up felt godly lol
[4:41:25] IAmSolari: it did feel fucking awesome havign the damage amp

[4:49:51] Slapsstick: @dorki there was the pvp talent...? or lego or something in SL that gave their intervein target spellreflect, thatd be sick
[4:49:55] Hexacronic: Is holy priest too far behind in M+ compared to other healers in higher keys?
[4:50:00] RamblingJosh_: Spell reflect should be a choice node, the other option is an always active, 1 in 8 chance to reflect anything
[4:50:07] remtried: how important is raid gear for disc this season?

[5:04:35] palthis: idk why but the ads on your stream are consistently longer than some of the other streamers I watch. 60+ secs vs 20-30 secs on others. Is it because of the # of viewers?

[5:07:21] Slapsstick: throne with the sentinel pulls
[5:07:29] m_dep: I'm just a +20 scrub caster and I thought everyone focused either highest health or most dangerous?
[5:08:12] m_dep: ah makes sense
[5:08:18] KaladinHS: what if my class involves spreading dots by tabing to other mobs
[5:08:48] miyo2322: I don't play wow to think FailFish
[5:08:51] m_dep: how close to death does a mob need to be to focus it down for reducing incoming damage?
[5:08:59] m_dep: or always highest health?
[5:09:04] huuskers: Critical thinking LUL
[5:09:07] Morayeden: Bruh, DPS will cope so hard to justify their pad when the shiitter mobs would just die to passive dmg.
[5:09:09] flockheart: NOTED
[5:09:13] Vudak: anti padder propaganda
[5:09:21] MierkaBlue: I used to have a WA that marked X on the highest health mob in bolstering weeks
[5:09:24] Clandestin: sometimes you focus down high prio low hp mobs to chain too
[5:09:39] Linith_Heart: i think im an outlier but as long as the key gets timed fuck overall
[5:10:17] Slapsstick: @Clandestin cries in rogue

[5:12:38] imjebb: yea but irs like bad
[5:12:39] Slapsstick: the fact people still dont understand that, if the other team is doing less damage you will have less healing is insane
[5:13:06] varimatras: hey yummy
[5:13:12] varimatras: i cant make a choice mateee
[5:13:15] cucumbertoessniffa: yeah and the tanks like roadhog make healing warped, because he takes damage and heals himself back. so if your tank is a roadhog and the other healers seem to have more healing, people say "they outhealed you" but its just because of our tank choice
[5:13:20] TadinGG: isnt beginner healing pretty easy to determine if you are doing good - did anyone die that didn't need to? Did you do dps in between? Evaluation complete
[5:13:27] varimatras: Disc Priest Or Resto Shaman For Pugs i play alone hich one is better
[5:13:42] Axmaster55: xdd

[5:17:47] KaladinHS: If I pad hard I don't get blamed for bricking the key tho
[5:17:48] Morayeden: Watching people pad on the oozes on second boss of Throne is Wiiiild.
[5:18:04] Slapsstick: Ass rogue spatter cleave goes hard

[5:25:00] menzlo: they don't want you to kill the mobs before they have their dots out
[5:25:13] foremeraldx: Makes sense so they are the only padder in the group
[5:25:19] Chewbaccaw: they wanna kill the mobs before they have to camp bear for 30 globals
[5:25:22] huuskers: @Linith_Heart No because witherbark is a shitter mob LUL
[5:25:26] baseboned: I feel like his overall point takes 5 seconds to say, but he's padding the video out to 12 minutes with this example from everbloom that's completely unnecesary
[5:25:35] Petarglio: where is gnarlroot? literally unplayable

[5:26:31] miyo2322: this video has an audience of maybe a few hundred players KEKW
[5:26:35] jess0x9: do u ever think abt how insane this entire video would sound to someone who doesn't play wow like just having an entire category in a chart called "shitter mobs"
[5:26:42] ZellieMasters: So I think he needs to specify whether the mobs require an interrupt, stun or other cc ability vs whether it does unavoidable frontal damage because the list will be subjective based on the role of the person making the list.
[5:26:46] kakebuts: NOTED
[5:26:49] Ehsanfury: tank hitters = shitter mobs NOTED got it
[5:26:53] Enluh: So moral of the story is take fire mages and no boomkins?
[5:26:57] Briar_L: he was starfalling the assistants like half an hour ago Classic
[5:26:58] kondelol: xdd
[5:26:59] flockheart: xdd
[5:26:59] Petarglio: GIGACHAD
[5:27:00] MierkaBlue: dorki hack
[5:27:02] maxthrustt: based
[5:27:10] popularviber: w! xdd
[5:27:13] Shimorta: dorki tank hack, never on his boomkin
[5:27:17] Morayeden: This is insane tech
[5:27:19] dread_kitten: as a boomkin main we dont accept him
[5:27:20] yctnm: all boomkins have mind melded
[5:27:24] Petarglio: blight chunks need to die xdd
[5:27:41] gelth: so the video is actually about how to tell who is a filthy padder? I like it
[5:27:44] popularviber: he 100% starfalls these packs xdd
[5:27:48] TadinGG: lets go watch a tettles key and see if we see a starfall on the dragon pull
[5:27:53] Linith_Heart: !sck
[5:27:54] Nightbot: DO NOT USE THIS WEAKAURA https://wago.io/PTAc84Jp-
[5:28:07] huuskers: Where did he get these perfect cutout images to use
[5:28:11] kitty0chi: what is this boomie propaganda!??
[5:28:17] HarveyPls: i feel like everyone knows this but doesnt care
[5:28:21] cucumbertoessniffa: lmao you are shitting on this guy
[5:28:28] Petarglio: just hit the mob with more health
[5:28:34] maxthrustt: @HarveyPls corrext
[5:28:36] Chewbaccaw: 12 minutes, boom getting the money; ad money raking it in
[5:28:51] c3rby_: Bruh i garuantee this info doesnt help anyone in a pug at all because unless all the dps are coordinating dmg it
[5:29:03] yctnm: All I learned is that dps player are forever in a self inflicted prisoners' dilemma
[5:29:06] miyo2322: "imagine you weren't there" Sadge
[5:29:24] Sunshade88: theres an MO vid about AOE cap removal, basically, let us aoe
[5:29:32] dread_kitten: good vid for newer players maybe
[5:29:51] Latensify: Hell yeah
[5:29:52] TadinGG: @c3rby_ even if just a single person uses correct prio damage it makes a big difference
[5:30:11] HeffaBear: my meter number bigger than your meter number therefor you bad BASEG
[5:30:19] kitty0chi: then the boomie can do prio dmg
[5:30:28] c3rby_: @TadinGG you have to balance prio and aoe damage. This is really just relevant for groups who know what the dmg profile will be
[5:30:34] c3rby_: in a pug this is getting tossed out
[5:30:40] Axmaster55: xdd
[5:30:42] fronkacean: dw about it
[5:30:44] Jisunah: PepeLaugh
[5:30:49] kondelol: xdd Û†ÄÄ
[5:30:52] dread_kitten: ü§ì
[5:30:54] c3rby_: bruh thats like 90% of his stream
[5:30:58] misran: interesting :)
[5:31:02] ligmalolkekw: xddDespair
[5:31:06] TadinGG: @dread_kitten do new players watch videos like this? Do they watch anything at all or do they just blast?
[5:31:10] menzlo: elon coded
[5:31:12] huuskers: I knew that M+ drama video was going to cook when I saw the thumbnail
[5:31:29] Ehsanfury: I see Drama SNIFFA
[5:31:58] kakebuts: i just feel like it doesnt take 10 minutes to explain
[5:32:21] Jisunah: stuckass im doing same rotation
[5:32:33] kitty0chi: or the tank chains it into next pull?
[5:32:49] Adrang: NOTED KILL ZUUL
[5:32:49] Melancholy_Mode: I just play havoc and firemage so my ST and AoE rotations pretty much the same xdd
[5:32:50] Axmaster55: But my Divine Storm
[5:32:54] Axmaster55: I see many HP bar
[5:33:14] MierkaBlue: ^as a retri alt, I feel this :D
[5:33:50] Jangoman: bears need to die first
[5:33:57] Melancholy_Mode: The only damage that matters is the damage on the last thing to die
[5:34:00] Tharruk12: In retail i only play m+. When I compare our gameplay to some of your groups or other high m+ players there is a lot less travel time without fighting something, cause a lot of ppl, don't know how to chain pulls. And you can't pull as much 'cause you don't have enough coordination to stop all mops in the pull, that need to be stopps. Also no one in pugs does priority damage =)
[5:34:20] foremeraldx: Yes but it makes others' overall lower as well, hence you blame the tank for bad route
[5:34:54] Slapsstick: its all the healers fault YEPPERS
[5:34:56] Melancholy_Mode: just mute the healer xdd
[5:35:18] dorki: disc priest Madge
[5:35:29] oceansetups: "link me the route" - triggered xD
[5:35:45] kitty0chi: that triggers me so bad
[5:35:51] Jangoman: cause he got yelled at by another healer
[5:35:51] SCMSV: KEKW
[5:35:57] Aboknes: oh a tank standing there like an npc
[5:35:58] Jangoman: move fast eat ass ptsd
[5:35:58] KaladinHS: asking for a route is bad?
[5:36:15] misran: in pugs tanks will stand in front of vol'kaal for like 10 seconds waiting for people to take their stations
[5:36:18] SCMSV: NPC Tank
[5:36:25] Adrang: a tank yelled at me in a weekly 20 in eb when i wasnt drinking before a boss
[5:36:27] Zempre: shut up an dheal me
[5:36:29] baseboned: man I've never even installed MDT, I don't even wanna know the route, Imma follow and press radiance buddy I dont even need to know what dungeon Im in
[5:36:35] Jangoman: I mean pugs its hard to feel out either tank or healer sometimes
[5:36:45] Slapsstick: Mr streamer can you make me feel better? I've had 3  20s with a disc that will only heal with flash heal and penance and 0 atonement Sadge its honestly almost as impressive as actually healing
[5:36:50] huuskers: Man I had some healer say "go, go, go" on the 3rd boss in EB yesterday while they were drinking at 60% mana. So I pulled, and they let 2 people die to the first fire.
[5:36:53] Tharruk12: And then in rise you pull every 2 or 3 mob pack in the start by itself and spend ages on that platform
[5:36:54] Nightbot: üîî Subscribe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yumytv and follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/yumytv üê¶
[5:37:08] c3rby_: sample size
[5:37:19] c3rby_: were so fucken down bad these days
[5:37:20] Linith_Heart: people only care about time during fights and people forget to optimize down time
[5:37:24] baseboned: let 2 people die? or two people didn't hit any defensives?
[5:37:27] kakebuts: same in heroic raid pugs. tanks and healers are ilvl 462 and dps are 487
[5:37:35] MierkaBlue: @baseboned ^^ this
[5:37:59] Jangoman: I play Aug and it hurts my soul getting rejected :( cause I can't visually carry their dps even tho I do anywya
[5:38:10] cbbl: there are like 100 healers playing the game right now
[5:38:13] oceansetups: tank shortage way wooorse
[5:38:14] c3rby_: scared em off with the first patch ig
[5:38:20] huuskers: @baseboned Actually a good question. I don't remember. It was a 20 so I don't think it's a long shot to assume both
[5:38:29] Aboknes: Healing is not fun atm imo.
[5:38:35] kitty0chi: cuz now we got the annoying oneshots, we didn't have that in bfa
[5:38:44] c3rby_: They nerfed healing heavy going into DF
[5:38:45] baseboned: even at a 20 you cant heal threw people getting hit by fire
[5:38:50] baseboned: through
[5:39:04] baseboned: my brain is so bad at spelling man
[5:39:39] fronkacean: they def are if prepared right
[5:39:41] Jangoman: Nah blizzard doesn't give a fuck
[5:39:43] Chewbaccaw: you gotta stay within the box tho
[5:39:45] fronkacean: when i met ion he was complimenting jak on his videos
[5:39:48] fronkacean: saying they watched them all
[5:39:51] Ronningx: how do you survive high keys one shots with disc??
[5:39:55] Jangoman: complaint/Suggestion box gets emptied twice daily into the trash
[5:40:06] c3rby_: Dont touch my mages 6 defensives
[5:40:07] Axmaster55: Make everyone become a shaman
[5:40:13] buzzkill00: no man I think def are fine for most classes
[5:40:15] Chewbaccaw: @Axmaster55 forgotten?
[5:40:21] Thowarr: You need a balance between the classes and the dungeons
[5:40:40] oceansetups: @Ronningx vers
[5:40:48] Jangoman: The only defensive that I think has and always has been bullshit is Pally Bubble
[5:40:48] oceansetups: fade
[5:40:49] yunghungdiv: a majority of specs feeling tanky kinda forces raid mechanics to one shot more
[5:40:54] Petarglio: now try convincing every non-healer that defensives should be weaker
[5:41:01] rindioh: keys are kinda either 1shotty or a massive dps check. I like the dps check more
[5:41:07] broskeleton: How does a holy priest live all? @yumytv
[5:41:10] jonpelf: defensives are skill diffs tho.  taking those out will make things boring
[5:41:26] Thowarr: It's like when at the start of each season here they said healers were too powerful, and then smacked them all down.
[5:41:38] HekticFox: i feel like most people would like to be fighting timer (pull/damage optimisation) rather than the survival challenge we have now (i feel like this is easier tho)
[5:41:38] huuskers: LUL
[5:41:50] c3rby_: I think its less about being too many and more about the disparity between the amount between different classes
[5:41:55] Jangoman: defensives should always be offensively!!
[5:42:00] doomwh1sp3r: I do often find 4/5 people in my group playing Geoguessr during keys. Me being one of them
[5:42:08] Shimorta: if defensives were weaker in this season, it would be extremely unfun, timers would be timeable by 8 minutes and you'd just wipe to unliveable bosses
[5:42:19] maladendron: it‚Äôs like the old discursive problem - decirsing was automatic so the pressure was to make really punishing decurse checks
[5:42:37] TadinGG: more rot less super burst
[5:42:42] maladendron: *decursive
[5:42:53] Shimorta: damage would need to be like -30% for less defensives to make sense
[5:42:58] Jangoman: They could give downsides to defensives
[5:43:04] Chewbaccaw: cauterize needs to be baseline with all mage specs
[5:43:06] sskkskks: Big missed opportunity when u had the freaking president of Blizz as a chatter and didnt really take advantage of it
[5:43:21] cucumbertoessniffa: true
[5:43:22] Axmaster55: xdd
[5:43:23] MierkaBlue: @Jangoman they already do, iceblock? boomy going bear?
[5:43:31] c3rby_: He might
[5:43:32] Shimorta: @Jangoman who uses iceblock kek
[5:43:34] kondelol: xdd
[5:43:35] Petarglio: I'm not sure exactly what they need to do but they need to figure out something, because this season feels really bad in terms of survivability
[5:43:38] c3rby_: you never know because it was squandered
[5:43:43] Celestial990: xdd blizzard president balances m+ dmg versus enemy hp balance
[5:43:46] Jangoman: @MierkaBlue they do but not all classes have things like that
[5:43:47] popularviber: LMAO
[5:43:52] huuskers: They have a tier list control panel LUL
[5:43:52] baseboned: lmao, people really clueless about ybarra
[5:43:59] ohfoeshow: holy shit chatters are stupid
[5:44:02] c3rby_: Squandered smh
[5:44:03] Thowarr: Just look at the numbers, Pete!
[5:44:07] cucumbertoessniffa: and now hes not there
[5:44:08] Vestaliss: Growl playing the long game
[5:44:10] doomwh1sp3r: Blizz president walks in WoW Dev office "HEY THIS CAT WITH A WAFFLE TOLD ME THIS"
[5:44:11] cucumbertoessniffa: so you missed out
[5:44:13] miyo2322: all I'm hearing are excuses
[5:44:15] Shimorta: m+ is the most fun when timer is the limiter to the key imo, so whatever they need to do for that is what they should do
[5:44:19] MierkaBlue: @Jangoman yes but everyone hates those - because you cannot play/do your job when you use them
[5:44:20] HekticFox: the real squander was not asking for a tour of blizz hq
[5:44:31] Glonzo: @yumytv do you think Shaman tank can make it to retail since its doing great in SOD?
[5:44:34] c3rby_: Kalamazi does it every day, begging people to fix his class
[5:44:37] Thowarr: You wouldn't live the 1 shots or the rot damage
[5:44:46] doomwh1sp3r: I mean Shaman defensives could at least not increase damage taken LUL
[5:44:48] Thowarr: Basically you'd be a boomi
[5:44:50] Azyniah: didnt he promise you alpha think he got that in before he left?
[5:44:53] Jangoman: @MierkaBlue you hate them because of that but it makes them hurt when you do it
[5:44:59] Thowarr: JuST gO BerFurM
[5:45:00] c3rby_: Give everyone class 2 yes
[5:45:09] Axmaster55: Despairge
[5:45:12] Puqen: @Glonzo I'd be suprised if they focused on adding more tank specs rather than some support specs
[5:45:13] buzzkill00: but most classes are like that minus a 3-4 outliers
[5:45:18] Shimorta: world first keys would be like tyrannical 25's
[5:45:22] Shimorta: and you'd have 10 minutse on the timer
[5:45:42] c3rby_: People already stacking vers
[5:45:46] Thowarr: People would be using PvP trinkets
[5:45:53] Shimorta: damage needs to be a lot lower for that to make sense
[5:45:57] ArusVicious: you already run fyrakk cuz of that
[5:46:02] Shimorta: we just do too much damage this season
[5:46:02] ArusVicious: keys just overtuned
[5:46:07] aidan_pryde: @yumytv ilvl would be 483 with 30+% avoidance
[5:46:14] sorenkje: u'd run 5 immunities comp
[5:46:21] Shimorta: if you took this season, and aura nerfed the game by 30%, i think it would genuinely be fine
[5:46:23] boofbumps: versa should not exist as a stat
[5:46:25] c3rby_: Defensives need to be brought into parity between classes
[5:46:25] Thowarr: Which is where we are now: dungeons should've been tuned 2 months ago, as well as doing actual class balance
[5:46:49] Jangoman: yeah skill and class gaps
[5:47:00] Celestial990: Do i have rose tinted glasses or was this not a problem at all in bfa? you had some survivability/heal checks but it was mostly just do mechanics well and do big pulls
[5:47:16] baseboned: no one played tyran in bfa
[5:47:16] kitty0chi: they need to make defensives between classes be roughly equally good
[5:47:24] boofbumps: if ur a spec that uses vers as bis stat then ur just immediately much better for m+
[5:47:31] dorki: bfa was simpler
[5:47:34] Puqen: @boofbumps cries in WW
[5:47:44] dorki: less shit to manage
[5:47:44] Linith_Heart: i want to live in a world where no class have defensives and i dont ever have to think about it
[5:47:49] not_chivalry: bfa had some good M+
[5:47:50] Cash_heals: Vers corruption
[5:48:02] baseboned: shadowlands was better, timers mattered
[5:48:17] kitty0chi: corrution was both insane and fun
[5:48:23] Jangoman: I mean dest lock was pretty nuts to
[5:48:24] c3rby_: Idk there are soo many classes that blast in dps rn
[5:48:35] Shimorta: if actually beating the timer in 25's was hard right now, i don't think this whole defensive conversation would even be happening, we just giga blast too hard so we're at too high key levels
[5:48:52] cucumbertoessniffa: i just googled when bfa was released and i almost puked
[5:49:10] RamblingJosh_: I wish the mobs didn't instantly fall over on lower keys
[5:49:17] Tharruk12: Crit Corruption had so weired interactions with class talents and so one
[5:49:18] reedsworld: @cucumbertoessniffa when did it release?
[5:49:25] foremeraldx: Then, bigger pulls need to be designed, and therefore ppl will need extra survivability to time the key......
[5:49:41] Shimorta: yep!
[5:49:42] buzzkill00: @dorki where degen demon hours stream peepoSad
[5:49:42] c3rby_: Thats just mage also having 7 defensives and group util isnt it
[5:49:49] brainrot_behavior: m+ is something else
[5:49:59] cucumbertoessniffa: @reedsworld aug 2018
[5:50:04] Shimorta: timer should be the thing that gates you first for it to feel the best imo
[5:50:13] cucumbertoessniffa: 2018!
[5:50:21] fronkacean: Oldge
[5:50:30] m_dep: I dont remember caring about the timer since SL
[5:50:32] m_dep: wtf
[5:50:36] m_dep: maybe df s1
[5:50:40] Shimorta: take this season, aura nerf everyone by 30%, what happens? are we even talking about defensives rn?
[5:50:40] cucumbertoessniffa: I still remember the JY key when dorki shifted out of bear LOL
[5:50:41] p_plop: 2018 was only like 2 years ago right?
[5:50:47] c3rby_: Buff mob HP, make mobs live longer let ramp classes dps sooner
[5:50:47] sskkskks: the new president of Blizz follows Fleks on twitter were all doomed man
[5:50:55] Repsie: whats the point of anything doing dmg then? if its just a thing with hp scaling
[5:51:07] m_dep: maybe I was just too noob during SL KEKW
[5:51:09] milcah_us_illidan: Sup shadow buddies
[5:51:28] baseboned: nah I remember sl timers being more challenging than DF ones, maybe I got better I dunno
[5:51:28] TadinGG: basically you want the complication to be - how do we do enough damage to beat the timer and not how do we not die so we can time
[5:51:34] c3rby_: eww
[5:51:57] Shimorta: @TadinGG yeah this version of the key is way more fun imo
[5:51:57] Celestial990: @Repsie its about the ratio of how much dmg stuff is doing to you versus how much hp it has. You dont wanna be hitting a punching bag for 2 min but you also dont want the punching bag to punch you back in the nuts every 10 seconds
[5:52:03] Slapsstick: venthyr boomie go brrrr
[5:52:12] Kerzor1996: theater of pain monka
[5:52:12] c3rby_: brr as in explode?
[5:52:12] kitty0chi: i think you want both tadin - you just dont want it favoring some classes
[5:52:24] BrotherVT: the seasonal affixes were pretty cool in shadowlands
[5:52:44] broskeleton: @BrotherVT FUCK PRIDEFUL
[5:52:45] Shimorta: 0-4 death, pulling insane, barely making timer is the idael M+ xperience
[5:52:47] baseboned: like my guild never did keys higher than 18 in SL, but this season they all got portals
[5:52:53] TadinGG: @kitty0chi i really dont - i want to blast - as long as the healer is doing his job I dont want to have anything to do with it other than doing normal mechanics
[5:52:53] huuskers: Affixes are not fun, change my mind
[5:52:53] HekticFox: yea seeing 20 death atal 30s is  kinda dumb
[5:53:00] BrotherVT: encrypted was super fun
[5:53:00] MierkaBlue: mist was wild, sanguine depths and angel place were cursed at the start of SL
[5:53:04] kitty0chi: pillars in s4 bfa were great
[5:53:05] Axmaster55: Infested Despairge
[5:53:17] Vestaliss: M+ is more fun to watch too when the timer is the concern
[5:53:19] relicz: what do you think about rotating the 2 best seasonals and getting rid of fort tyran
[5:53:23] Repsie: Encrypted was goated af
[5:53:30] Slapsstick: YEP
[5:53:33] not_chivalry: yes
[5:53:35] kitty0chi: that one
[5:53:38] milcah_us_illidan: Ef affixes
[5:53:57] Thowarr: Part of the reason seasonal's were good were they were actual Kisses to the kiss/curse mentality
[5:54:00] Slapsstick: TOTT PepeLaugh
[5:54:03] c3rby_: Thundering really changed up how i played, to a lot to not at all.
[5:54:04] Thowarr: There's no kiss atm; just all curse
[5:54:15] Axmaster55: Yeah every fucking mob has sight its such bullshit
[5:54:38] Morayeden: Nah, if the good seasonal were just regular affixes they would still be sick
[5:54:53] ArusVicious: What's a dungeon so far this expac that you think really checked all the marks of what a good dungeon is?
[5:54:54] p_plop: i miss having 60% haste with shrouded
[5:54:54] kakebuts: hug and kiss
[5:54:55] Axmaster55: Make out affix
[5:54:55] Repsie: encrypted made de other side so much better
[5:54:56] CrunchCrunch: in hindsight thundering wasnt that bad
[5:55:06] Thowarr: You need some kind of positive, because affixes on their own is curses
[5:55:06] HekticFox: thundering but without the %hp on enemies :)
[5:55:18] milcah_us_illidan: It's fkn RNG
[5:55:20] TadinGG: @ArusVicious there really isnt one - you have to go to previous expansions
[5:55:21] c3rby_: Thudnering was ass, because quaking was also a thing
[5:55:29] fronkacean: and the gain was so mid
[5:55:30] c3rby_: And during fights like temple
[5:55:31] yunghungdiv: it just interacted with the core gameplay so poorly
[5:55:32] c3rby_: first boss
[5:55:37] buzzkill00: @CrunchCrunch aint no way you're thinking that
[5:55:50] milcah_us_illidan: Fuck RNG
[5:55:53] dorki: tank getting stunned playing with 3 range Aware
[5:56:01] HumanityDH: or if you let a Incorp go off you just die
[5:56:07] HumanityDH: on some bosses
[5:56:08] kitty0chi: 14 stacks?
[5:56:12] broskeleton: @dorki Just drag the cleaves onto the ranged
[5:56:13] SCMSV: yumytvDeadge
[5:56:18] broskeleton: the frontals and cleaves
[5:56:20] MierkaBlue: to be fair bursting used to be bit like that in SL so you just mass dispelled :D
[5:56:20] hezzey_07: Just like afflicted and incorp
[5:56:33] HumanityDH: shrouded and cryptic was so good
[5:56:39] HumanityDH: OP good
[5:56:40] HumanityDH: yes
[5:56:44] Celestial990: Shrouded was just bfa corruptions but you get your stats mid-key
[5:56:44] kitty0chi: no
[5:56:49] kitty0chi: yes
[5:56:49] Repsie: I mean getting more dmg/haste etc is just fun
[5:56:52] HumanityDH: big number ook ook
[5:56:54] Thowarr: How about if the affix just gives a positive reward
[5:56:55] RayWoz: I remember dratnos and kristas article that said thundering was basically a 2% gain over a dungeon
[5:56:57] milcah_us_illidan: Affix is RNG I don't want RNG
[5:57:00] c3rby_: Why not? if it affects all dungeons and people equally its fine
[5:57:04] kitty0chi: so what if keys go to 100?
[5:57:06] RamblingJosh_: I really like playing around afflicted, but sometimes you just can't do it

[5:57:52] hivplus__: Joe biden dorkis biggest fan FeelsStrongMan
[5:57:53] sorenkje: Aware

[5:58:02] Chewbaccaw: dorki based

[5:58:15] MicHawkh: when does this season end?
[5:58:20] HekticFox: corporate acc
[5:58:22] milcah_us_illidan: Are you dense? rNG is bs
[5:58:23] pussssiiiipumper: spriest s tier?
[5:58:29] Repsie: @yumytv do you think fort/tyra score should weigh the same for overall score, making it so they don't have to be balanced
[5:58:30] c3rby_: Corporate
[5:58:52] Chewbaccaw: hmmm
[5:58:54] jess0x9: do u think she asked Ybarra who she should follow and he was like "yeah u should follow my fav wafflecat streamer yumytv"
[5:58:56] Chewbaccaw: dunno bout that one dude
[5:58:58] c3rby_: Its nice to have someone actually play the game
[5:59:09] c3rby_: I believe she did stuff for cod for years but on the business end
[5:59:10] unodapally: Dorki. Do you stick your tongue out when you do high keys?
[5:59:27] milcah_us_illidan: I can't even right now
[5:59:30] RamblingJosh_: How did he own? He did keys but I don't think the WoW team really interacted with him
[5:59:57] Chewbaccaw: cosby suite Aware
[6:00:00] m_dep: how tf does somebody have time to be president of a goddamn company and also play videogames at a top tier level
[6:00:08] m_dep: wtf stacked deck at birth
[6:00:09] baseboned: he forced people to return to office months before laying them off...
[6:00:10] Thowarr: @RamblingJosh_ we know his guild sold runs
[6:00:16] dorki: https://twitter.com/Thdlock/status/1752433798669570468
[6:00:19] dorki: holy THD is based
[6:00:22] HekticFox: he had good public relations, outside of that whoknows
[6:00:26] c3rby_: @baseboned different people got laid off what
[6:00:27] fronkacean: does not follow me.
[6:00:28] fronkacean: heart breaking.
[6:00:31] c3rby_: thats like the esports side
[6:00:32] Thowarr: @baseboned That's def a "one of us" award there
[6:00:52] Morayeden: How can he be so right all the time
[6:00:57] milcah_us_illidan: Fuck face affixes are RNG do you understand that
[6:01:03] kitty0chi: bb growl
[6:01:10] sskkskks: idk it was nice that the C-suite person running the company actually played the game even if in the end he was still a C-suite person
[6:01:13] Celestial990: ok nvm im a THD fan again
[6:01:16] o7_Steve: 1 way to say his team is monkies
[6:01:37] baseboned: youre saying no one that got laid of was formerly remote work? lol ok dude....
[6:01:44] Morayeden: 20 man and the mythic lockout
[6:01:51] fronkacean: but also wouldnt it just be worse if it was less?
[6:01:59] popularviber: imagine pugging your way to ce by just subbing in with guilds every night
[6:02:01] c3rby_: As soon as you remove a certain player requirement i garauntee people with math out the best amount of players to clear and that will be a new requirement
[6:02:03] m_dep: mythic lockout is the core, core issue
[6:02:05] c3rby_: like the ratios in pugs
[6:02:13] yunghungdiv: 10 man raiding would be so much more enjoyable
[6:02:15] Repsie: pugging mythic is so bad, if 2-3 people leave its just done for the week
[6:02:18] milcah_us_illidan: Gear
[6:02:24] Axmaster55: xdd
[6:02:25] dorki: thats fun
[6:02:25] RamblingJosh_: I used to love 10 man raiding back in the day, but it feels like such a small group these days
[6:02:36] Slapsstick: its because of sodas leadership Kappa
[6:02:43] Foerarn: Social aspect > Difficulty
[6:02:47] abeldank: raiding is only 6-9 hrs a week and you can just do whatever. raid and m+ have inverse time commitments, where the beginning of the tier is more demanding for raiders, but then you can raid log the rest of the tier just getting a steady couple vault slots
[6:02:59] HumanityDH: very hard
[6:03:03] Axmaster55: Despairge
[6:03:03] yunghungdiv: i hate at least 10 people in my guild
[6:03:09] dorki: its insanely hard for me
[6:03:10] Linith_Heart: Despairge
[6:03:17] dorki: im just stuck with drogo healing less than my rdruid
[6:03:18] fronkacean: @dorki had to settle for growl...
[6:03:19] flockheart: DESPAIR
[6:03:24] Clush___: @yumytv since s1 i've pugged to 3500 both seasons in 100% voiceless pugs and have only added 2 total people to my friends list :)
[6:03:30] tigglers: us 3rd
[6:03:33] Aboknes: CLASSIC
[6:03:36] MierkaBlue: @dorki I mean you could have yumy
[6:03:46] c3rby_: Those people just clear AOTC
[6:03:50] milcah_us_illidan: Are you drunk wtf
[6:03:51] Repsie: pvp mains
[6:04:09] arment101: its not that much better
[6:04:09] HumanityDH: it would be dead
[6:04:13] sskkskks: Imagine if gang activity was just 20 drohgohs
[6:04:28] Axmaster55: People fucking LOVE cosmetics
[6:04:33] c3rby_: I prefer the cosmetic only route over nuking the people that want a challenge in a coordinated environment
[6:04:38] Thowarr: FF has that, and it's just as popular as WoW
[6:04:39] RamblingJosh_: I'm always surprised how much people only care about gear LOL
[6:04:39] Foerarn: FFXIV savage raiding is basically that and it worked for many years
[6:04:41] MierkaBlue: FF ultimates are pretty popular even though it is cosmetic
[6:04:43] arment101: the gear difference from heroic/crafted isn't much of a difference
[6:04:45] ActualTilt: you they arent good enough they dont deserve the loot
[6:04:47] o7_Steve: yeah but if it "dies" then it goes to show that people dont enjoy the content
[6:04:50] HumanityDH: it would be more dead than pvp unless they removed lockout and gutted tuning week after rwf
[6:04:54] milcah_us_illidan: I think you're stupid
[6:04:59] Clush___: give us solo que
[6:05:06] SCMSV: it would be FF ultimate, since ultimate doesnt really give a bis item
[6:05:14] tvdinherr: This guy hasn
[6:05:25] sukoWoW: "we're all stupid" BASED
[6:05:28] abeldank: i think all removing the lockout does is impact mid-tier guild recruiting and let's higher tier people pug earlier
[6:05:33] ActualTilt: if they aint good why do you think they deserve good loot
[6:05:33] o7_Steve: i think ur cookin just @ warcraft on twitter
[6:05:49] xzamolodx: growl talks like hes in a average run of the mill guild m+ group. All these statements are 100% based
[6:05:50] Morayeden: Gang Activity, the HoF guild, was having trouble getting 20 people. Like we are doomed
[6:05:52] Repsie: I dont even get the benefit of raid lockout/server limits
[6:05:53] HpalSteve: bring back 10man.  at least in Fated seasons.
[6:05:58] Thowarr: @yumytv can you link that article?
[6:05:58] jess0x9: y are all these posts so long they literary have a table of contents my brain is not big enough for this many words
[6:06:12] Adrang: damn way to call out gromnak
[6:06:12] yumytv: https://raider.io/news/610-mythic-raiding-and-progression-is-the-bar-too-high?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=tweet&utm_campaign=inside_look
[6:06:16] Thowarr: TY
[6:06:17] HpalSteve: 10 man mythic all day please. I beg you
[6:06:20] sukoWoW: growl cookin tonight
[6:06:36] c3rby_: Smaller mythic raids should be definitely considered
[6:06:39] Enluh: Only raid mythic for better m+ gear sadge
[6:06:41] c3rby_: I loved 10man heroic in cata
[6:06:45] imjebb: fixing weak auras is new game
[6:06:48] Morayeden: There's nothing wrong with Weakauras. Private Auras are garbage.
[6:06:58] Thowarr: @imjebb That'll cost us 2 expansions
[6:07:26] RamblingJosh_: hard to put the genie back in the bottle
[6:07:42] abeldank: archimonde LUL
[6:07:56] Tharruk12: Nobody
[6:07:59] Morayeden: They don't, though. There's no reason to try to try to arms race against Weakauras.
[6:08:00] x_ANiMa: literally zero
[6:08:05] milcah_us_illidan: I will be honest mythic killed my guild we had to merge egos took over who was the leader and killed friendships
[6:08:11] MierkaBlue: then again, WA's allow me as a more mediocre player to raid lead while playing with the harder mechanics, so bossmods+ wa's  enable that too
[6:08:14] c3rby_: Nuke tf out of weak auras. Having to have 40 weak auras to do a rotation locks out so many players from trying M+ in the first place
[6:08:20] Repsie: weakauras that just move a debuff or show cds are good for the game, weakauras that compute and solve a whole fight for you is bad
[6:08:28] HumanityDH: who didn‚Äôt press the macro
[6:08:32] dorki: asmongold was right baseg
[6:08:33] HumanityDH: LUL
[6:08:40] Clush___: who is bro talking to
[6:08:48] milcah_us_illidan: I will be honest mythic killed my guild we had to merge egos took over who was the leader and killed friendships
[6:08:51] AnabolicFreaks: last time i heard of that was Legion, where a guildie of mine progged mythic without any addon
[6:08:51] Celestial990: Listening 2 am game philosophy talks
[6:08:57] HumanityDH: bfa was such a good xpac
[6:09:02] Axmaster55: Sus
[6:09:19] milcah_us_illidan: I will be honest mythic killed my guild we had to merge egos took over who was the leader and killed friendships
[6:09:30] xzamolodx: the weak auras are bypassing the need for communication
[6:09:32] Thowarr: Aren't WA's derived from the released API data
[6:09:36] flockheart: I will be honest mythic killed my guild we had to merge egos took over who was the leader and killed friendships
[6:09:42] Morayeden: Private Auras are the reason they should just stop trying to fight weakauras
[6:10:08] Thowarr: It's a coding arms race
[6:10:14] dorki: it makes sense why they private aura
[6:10:25] c3rby_: There was no way in shit people were yoloing that
[6:10:26] milcah_us_illidan: @flockheart ty
[6:10:32] dorki: its just stupid that it doesnt work
[6:11:23] Thowarr: It also goes back to how they design the physical layout of the encounter; if all the shit is red, and they want you to spot this nebulous red thing over there...
[6:12:00] MierkaBlue: @Thowarr ^^ this
[6:12:10] c3rby_: Nuke em
[6:12:13] milcah_us_illidan: You talk too much and listen too little
[6:12:17] dorki: good solution is remove all combat addons
[6:12:36] c3rby_: this milcah guy is a troll. hes callin people fuck face drunk idiots
[6:12:36] flockheart: ICANT
[6:12:36] Celestial990: BASED
[6:12:37] Axmaster55: xdd
[6:12:40] dorki: listen closely
[6:12:40] kondelol: xdd Û†ÄÄ
[6:12:44] Klon_____: firstGarf
[6:12:46] flockheart: catsittingverycomfortablewaitingforkeytostart
[6:12:48] Foerarn: xdd
[6:12:50] HekticFox: private aura mechanics just need to be super obvious to solve (like igira spears could have been private and it would have been fine)
[6:12:50] ohfoeshow: i dont hear shit
[6:12:50] duskyv: just remove combat from game ez
[6:12:50] dorki: 2008 acc tho HOLY
[6:12:53] MierkaBlue: @dorki but then most mechanics should be easier as well
[6:12:53] dorki: this guys cookin
[6:12:53] Slapsstick: PauseChamp
[6:12:55] YuzukiKaze: starechamp
[6:12:56] Adrang: go back to talking please
[6:12:57] Celestial990: PauseChamp
[6:13:01] Slapsstick: the essay is coming
[6:13:01] c3rby_: Just read his chat history
[6:13:03] Tofterid: catJAMPARTY
[6:13:04] flockheart: does anyone know when growl will stop listening
[6:13:08] brainrot_behavior: listen more Madge
[6:13:10] Chewbaccaw: finally peace and quiet Bedge
[6:13:11] sskkskks: They should make mythic raid stupid and impossible for all RWF people then nerf it into the ground week 2 for the rest of us problem solved
[6:13:20] milcah_us_illidan: How would you fix things
[6:13:27] Repsie: blud YAPPP to much
[6:13:33] maladendron: I think it‚Äôs possible that Blizzard thinks ‚Äúweak aura but you have to push a button‚Äù is sufficient interaction
[6:13:37] Slapsstick: @milcah_us_illidan you told him to listen, now you want him to cook. Im confused\
[6:13:57] Morayeden: They could just stop trying to stop us
[6:14:10] Thowarr: The playerbase wants increasingly difficult encounters, but then use addons to solve a ton of that difficulty. How do they design around that?
[6:14:10] Repsie: officers do I think :)
[6:14:14] milcah_us_illidan: I don't like rambling
[6:14:15] Cash_heals: Bring back sunwell like bosses. Simple and hard.
[6:14:22] Klon_____: DKP Nerdge
[6:14:22] AnabolicFreaks: they did put a stop to WOD WA. they can do more now too
[6:14:25] m_dep: spreadsheets are helpful and fun
[6:14:26] Tabal01: In many ways, spreadsheets are a skill expression
[6:14:32] Tabal01: Unlike weak auras
[6:14:33] m_dep: I LIKE IT
[6:14:35] Adrang: i just like data
[6:14:36] m_dep: i cant be the only one
[6:14:36] c3rby_: you gotta save players from themselves
[6:14:38] Subbed_No_Ban: Subbed_No_Ban subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! GoldPLZ
[6:14:39] Celestial990: @milcah_us_illidan do you want him to bullet point his thoughts and pause for 10 seconds between each one?
[6:14:41] imjebb: looks cool :)
[6:14:49] HekticFox: our healer spread sheets defensive use for m+ fights
[6:15:00] terrawyn_: in my old guild one of the guys wives made the spreadsheets, didnt even play the game
[6:15:02] milcah_us_illidan: Like I do this shit with I'm drunk
[6:15:04] haselforst: heaking officer in my guild has fucking hardon for any spreadsheet he can get his fingers on KEKW
[6:15:12] xzamolodx: I think WA are so prevalent  in raid and mainly mythic raid is because its a scripted fight. If most of the fight was random. It would be up to the player to make a decision. Not a WA
[6:15:25] flockheart: KEKW
[6:15:35] milcah_us_illidan: If I could join voice I would
[6:15:55] abeldank: spreadsheets just formalize a process that a guild will go through during prog anyway
[6:16:02] naser1369: !ui
[6:16:02] Nightbot: Addon list here: https://justpaste.it/5pvuo NEW UI vid: https://youtu.be/_cn344NOZd8 .New Exports here: https://linktr.ee/yumytv
[6:16:13] not_chivalry: no more repair
[6:16:39] maladendron: tindral would be untenable if there was any run back at all
[6:16:44] c3rby_: people wipe in classic?
[6:16:45] jess0x9: ngl raiding ppl's spreadsheet game has NOTHING on what ppl who do "casual" content like mount collecting do
[6:16:46] Dermortis1990: The worst is raiding in a guild where every try takes 10min because someone has to always be afk or do other shit and delays the acutal pull
[6:16:56] milcah_us_illidan: Holy shit Canadian
[6:17:01] banditrox12: Is there a clip from Fyrakk kill?
[6:17:15] F3ly: Don't people have complex macros to use consumables and buff? nobodydoes click everything individually at that level
[6:17:16] Dermortis1990: Seliathan is a German Rogue Player yes :D
[6:17:19] idkcrazed: yeah hes a good rogue
[6:17:20] c3rby_: YOu cant say hes omega good then call him ass growl
[6:17:30] catsthemusicalz: how much longer do you think rtwf would take without addons?
[6:17:44] im_boredt: yah vitaminp approved it,i  its DEFS A BANGER
[6:17:45] SCMSV: Seli is actually someone Ive talked to before
[6:17:51] SCMSV: he works on icy veins too
[6:17:51] milcah_us_illidan: You're Canadian aren't you lol
[6:18:04] Ragsharos: just have a warlock that is not shit KEKW
[6:18:21] Repsie: week 1 hc in pugs is hell for wipes
[6:18:23] Phelcrycks: its just part of the game... the rp origens thing
[6:18:31] not_chivalry: none
[6:18:34] Ehsanfury: xdd
[6:18:39] RamblingJosh_: I mean they choose every raid tier not to have a spirit healer and blacksmith outside every boss arena
[6:18:40] Ragsharos: actually none
[6:18:48] flockheart: xdd
[6:18:53] c3rby_: Honestly
[6:18:54] c3rby_: Based
[6:18:56] Thowarr: Why do you need to summon people? You should be ready, already at the entrance; quit being lazy fucks
[6:18:57] Axmaster55: BASEG
[6:18:58] Avelstoon: every warlock ever
[6:18:58] Ragsharos: the warlock puts the thing down and starts summoning xdd
[6:18:58] RealPeps: real tho
[6:19:02] Aqril1993: You guys have warlocks?
[6:19:03] Pallyex53: i fucking hate warlocks
[6:19:04] HarveyPls: they complain about having to summon thats part of the class
[6:19:07] reedsworld: i feel attacked

[6:19:09] HarveyPls: @Thowarr case in question
[6:19:11] Yuped: Thats the law though, you only every put up the stone :)
[6:19:12] F3ly: Haha, so true
[6:19:12] milcah_us_illidan: You re Canadian so obvi
[6:19:19] Repsie: they act like they don't know what to do, they need someone to tell them to put that shit down xdd
[6:19:19] Torgus_: we have servants for that Kappa
[6:19:24] baseboned: neb would never do that, catjam locks were the best
[6:19:32] c3rby_: Already doin yall a favor, and yall wantmore
[6:19:33] Vestaliss: Just give guilds a summon ability
[6:19:39] reedsworld: ya you tab out into diablo to keep the uptime
[6:19:39] x_ANiMa: if someone ever said please and thank you we'd maybe help
[6:19:40] Avelstoon: thats hunters that sign up to be the guild bitch right?
[6:19:41] MierkaBlue: healers should have summoning portals :D
[6:19:44] Morayeden: Summoning stone should just be a raid utility anyone can do
[6:19:45] Thowarr: They put portals to every m+ dungeon that takes you about 30 sec to get to, and people still wait on a summons
[6:19:47] manlyhandles: uber eats too with the healthstones
[6:19:57] milcah_us_illidan: Your accent comes thru
[6:20:05] spujetti: I dont play classic warlock but on retail I cast my stone and then other people can summon. Not doing everything
[6:20:20] c3rby_: True
[6:20:20] F3ly: time to get a weak aura that blocks your tab+alt keys when a open summoning is detected nearby
[6:20:22] Axmaster55: BASEG Û†ÄÄ
[6:20:24] relicz: another michigander :o
[6:20:25] imjebb: basically
[6:20:33] c3rby_: You only get one round of lock candy too
[6:20:37] sskkskks: Do you say thank you when someone drops a feast in a pug key
[6:20:38] milcah_us_illidan: Stupid
[6:20:39] sskkskks: Or do you stay silent
[6:20:40] Robbs_FPS: Damn the hard warlock life
[6:20:41] Ragsharos: i cast the stone and do summon bc if i dont do it we start like 15 mins late Sadge
[6:20:43] Aqril1993: I miss that they removed the guild summon...
[6:20:52] F3ly: @sskkskks i have a macro for that!
[6:20:52] RamblingJosh_: put it in the liquid WA pack, nobody will ever find it
[6:20:56] miirsmile: but you hide it under another WA Smart
[6:20:59] Slapsstick: HUH
[6:21:01] milcah_us_illidan: In vanilla I showed up early

[6:21:52] milcah_us_illidan: And made food for a 40 man raid gtfo
[6:21:53] abeldank: don't forget that no aug shatters mentals, just look at nerf and elle
[6:21:56] Thowarr: You need an Aug for the boomi
[6:22:01] YuzukiKaze: plink
[6:22:02] Hexacronic: How hard is disc learning in comparison to holy for dungeons?
[6:22:04] yctnm: fort group

[6:25:02] Repsie: at this point they should you 4x the amount of aspects you get
[6:25:27] abeldank: trying to farm back mindbender
[6:25:30] abeldank: and not being able to cast
[6:25:32] abeldank: is so painful
[6:26:00] Ragsharos: just have a warlock for dispells YEP
[6:26:07] milcah_us_illidan: Tried of your diatribe

[6:29:15] Adrang: he was very vocal that it was not by choice
[6:29:33] baseboned: aintnoway
[6:29:36] Adrang: the oly was because it "is only a 28"
[6:30:03] KaladinHS: why is throne the only key not timed on a 30

[6:31:25] Adrang: if this was te other day, he wiped and tilted hismelf hard
[6:33:15] miyo2322: I hate that color setup on the hp bars
[6:33:18] abeldank: ya it tilts me watching ayije because he just smites so fucking much
[6:33:18] miyo2322: not enough contrast
[6:33:25] julian_fmv: Wanna heal in a 27 tott? :)
[6:33:35] Axmaster55: xdd Û†ÄÄ
[6:34:04] Repsie: WideBoris tried smite?
[6:34:05] abeldank: it's like the bell curve meme where the shit discs just press smite and the best discs just press smite and then everyone else is trying to press other buttons LUL
[6:34:27] Scarooo34: @abeldank real
[6:34:54] lapendinha: are u having problems on healing mage boss on EB? I feel like I struggle so much as disc on it, I keep needing to move and stop healing
[6:35:23] abeldank: ayije legit never moves and just casts
[6:35:51] Reilinkz: he gets shocked
[6:35:52] abeldank: he didn't
[6:36:02] Repsie: this guy is not healing the same as last guy. he doing wrong, people die @yumytv
[6:36:02] abeldank: he got debuff 1, 2 went on nat, 3 went on kuru
[6:36:19] neinskn: i think it gets quicker tho through out the fight
[6:36:23] neinskn: atleast feels like it
[6:36:50] Nightbot: üîî Subscribe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yumytv and follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/yumytv üê¶
[6:37:32] SCMSV: NOTED
[6:38:28] Repsie: I liked looking at last guy more
[6:39:06] abeldank: and you're losing half casts from movement
[6:39:23] yctnm: Despairge
[6:39:26] Slapsstick: and you moved out of that smite cast as well
[6:39:31] Tofterid: mhm
[6:41:14] brandawgsta: im so sorry man
[6:41:17] brandawgsta: those were brutal Despairge
[6:41:28] brandawgsta: im washed this boss rolled me
[6:41:29] Vestaliss: I don't play disc so I genuinely don't know, why no pain suppression?
[6:41:29] Scarooo34: everything falls apart Despairgew
[6:41:49] abeldank: i hate it but it's just "stand still and smite"
[6:41:49] Vestaliss: Oh nvm there's one
[6:42:06] nahrniarcg: growl likes to be oom
[6:42:45] Slapsstick: this boss's tank damage while the totem is out MONKA I feel it so much on my brew LUL
[6:42:46] brandawgsta: don't beat yourself up we get em next time
[6:42:47] Ijee: it's really easy to just get into the flash heal spam on this boss
[6:43:04] Tharruk12: That's the reason I don't play healer, it's so punishing if you don't play your rotations correctly and you need to know so much, about when damage happens
[6:43:14] bigswiss6456: Did you time this?
[6:43:15] nahrniarcg: it doesnt target the same person twice so its pretty easy to control health pools
[6:43:16] abeldank: also no meme but pressing death without mindbender actually just feels wrong and i can't explain how
[6:43:49] Shimorta: @abeldank thats th eshadow prio, it's so scuffed that the disc prio is press death infinite
[6:43:51] yctnm: DESPAIR
[6:43:55] Slapsstick: send meta>get meleed>cry
[6:44:03] SCMSV: ICANT
[6:44:11] abeldank: @Shimorta no i swear in keys you just never want to death unless you have mindbender, even < 20%
[6:44:19] Ijee: just use one of the other big heal cds disc has Kappa
[6:44:21] KaladinHS: why dont you just get a lock to dispel flame shock with imp
[6:44:40] sabiesportpsychology: Is there a specific amount of vers you are going for this season or is it just whatever you get?
[6:44:41] Seja: Seja subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Wtf is this layout haha I love it
[6:45:30] neinskn: me2
[6:45:54] Ryok: i did this fight yesterday on a 20 and for some reason the first shadowbolt volley oneshot 3 of our people while it did like 20% on my havoc xD i guess i was the only one who pressed a defensive
[6:46:13] abeldank: entangling week i actually just never press fade until affix, but then the week after entangling, i just never press fade
[6:46:17] abeldank: it fucks with my muscle memory
[6:46:37] MierkaBlue: yeah fade is maybe the best personal atm and theentangling is ....brutal
[6:46:57] dorki: play mw in this comp wtf
[6:47:06] Ijee: last boss everbloom is especially bad with noit holding penance
[6:47:36] Repsie: does leaf scale like mage barrier does on this fight?
[6:47:53] dorki: more healing and another kick and mroe stops
[6:48:13] Yuccalyptus: yeah sweep + kick + rop just more than priest brings unfortch
[6:48:16] Konruseyd: and panda
[6:48:28] Yuccalyptus: plus you have fort already lol
[6:48:55] miketrouts: my group feels so much more topped off when i have a monk over disc
[6:48:58] Axmaster55: It looked like leaf scaled there
[6:49:23] baseboned: if you dont press halo in bender why ever press it
[6:49:33] sunrider19: @yumytv why are you not casting shadow word death there?
[6:49:41] sunrider19: procs inescepable torment
[6:49:57] sunrider19: yeah, but it extends mindbender
[6:50:02] sunrider19: so its not a waste of a global
[6:50:05] sunrider19: its global neutral
[6:50:12] Ijee: @miketrouts for me it's just that people love to take avoidable damage and it fucks the mindbender reset sometimes. I just hope this build is gone soon enough
[6:50:34] sskkskks: why does no one talk about how MW was already good and got 5% extra stam and a 200k shield on their 15s LOH with TTT in 10.2.5
[6:51:03] abeldank: death is only valuable if want the damage or you need the burst healing, but i still always press it xdd
[6:51:09] shooxcarrypotter: but it might give u time for another peanance
[6:51:17] baseboned: why are you mad mistweaver is good for the first time ever
[6:51:57] Shimorta: MW blasts hard
[6:52:04] feen33: imo MW > Druid in all honesty
[6:52:05] talerx: you get shield every 30s
[6:52:06] sabiesportpsychology: Is there a specific amount of vers you are going for this season or is it just whatever you get?
[6:52:09] Vestaliss: MW is nice on this boss and on witches
[6:52:14] Vestaliss: Mobile healing
[6:52:24] baseboned: same logic outside of bender tho, doesnt give cdr, is smite just always better?
[6:52:26] sunrider19: how much haste do you have on your priest?
[6:52:38] sunrider19: oh 41%
[6:52:44] Yuccalyptus: I feel like this week especially druid is struggling
[6:52:58] Shimorta: druid blasts hard on bursting
[6:53:14] dorki: a lot
[6:53:16] feen33: imho archmage is the worst boss
[6:53:17] feen33: for druid
[6:53:19] abeldank: galakrond?
[6:53:21] LeVshA_24: 3rd boss EB
[6:53:21] dorki: archmage for sure
[6:53:29] feen33: its really rough for druid
[6:53:31] Aceline_EU: how much haste is good for resto druid
[6:53:36] sunrider19: with 41% haste you lose 0.1 seconds of mindbender uptime from casting death
[6:53:38] shych00: Deios?
[6:53:41] baseboned: which one is archmage?
[6:53:45] talerx: who's good into archmage
[6:53:47] KaladinHS: which boss is bad for mw
[6:53:53] talerx: isnt boss giga rng with 3 or 4 hits happening
[6:53:58] abeldank: i feel like galakrond, i just yolo a convoke and pray it works vs being able to MB and penance during the slam
[6:54:05] baseboned: im terrible at knowing boss.names
[6:54:26] daerickson0522: 3rd of everbloom
[6:54:37] sunrider19: but in that specific instance, I think it was worth pressing. It does a pretty stupid amount of healing
[6:54:41] Konruseyd: guys, here the situation, TOTO26, shaman boss, I'm a healer MW, shaman cast fire shock on my rogue, my rogue recive a hit ~85-90% overall hp and died on a first tick of dot (I was out of everything for press), is this unfort/my fault or jus my rogue was bad? Is this a normal there?
[6:54:53] Konruseyd: TOTT*)))
[6:54:55] Phelcrycks: what about resto shamans?
[6:55:27] Shimorta: if you had no dispel and they died, feint saves them 100/100 times
[6:55:28] baseboned: oh, i would have thought druid was good because mobilty but i just dont understand druid very well, i guess theyre hard casting more now
[6:56:18] abeldank: and being able to move during penance during firestorm is so valuable
[6:56:25] sunrider19: btw, why are you not running twilight equillibrium?
[6:56:55] abeldank: but ayije runs it always so the rest of us just had to learn LUL
[6:57:19] sunrider19: disc discord said that in "sim", TE was better when purely buffing a singular penance per mindbender window which is kinda nuts
[6:57:41] abeldank: better than what?
[6:58:39] x_ANiMa: TE? twilight equilibrium?
[6:58:50] abeldank: do you track penance buffs? i stopped because i never saw myself changing my spellcast prio based on having the buffs vs not
[6:59:01] mynameis_Emil: What's up Growl?
[6:59:02] baseboned: random question then with te whats your dps rotation after evang?
[6:59:27] abeldank: ya agreed, i felt it was clutter
[6:59:45] baseboned: im on mobile i cant read it haha
[7:00:19] Remery: 3 mil in 1 cast
[7:00:39] abeldank: ya on tindral, it felt so obvious when either me or the other disc mistimed our penance during a seed set or something
[7:00:45] Remery: EVEN MORE WTF
[7:01:12] nahrniarcg: what is TE
[7:01:19] SCMSV: twilight equil
[7:01:26] baseboned: im so used to penance after mind blast gotta break thr habit
[7:02:32] Shimorta: fg terms hype
[7:02:40] brainrot_behavior: wait there's OS in wow ?
[7:03:38] JaeDaddaa: euh
[7:03:40] Repsie: when will you tank dorkis resto keys?
