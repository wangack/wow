One of our scientists accidentally put it in the microwave since he thought it was a chimichanga. Our bad. We have sent Aura a statue of the beloved mouse to put on his front lawn to commemorate its life. We know Aura loved the mouse as much as fucking chats wife. We hope to see the mouse prominently displayed on his front lawn and maybe at times on his stream.
