[0:33:36] famous1939: i do wish they'd soften the hpal dependence on tyrs. only healer like that
[0:33:50] Salanzo: i am noticing these boomy armor nerfs despite the stam buff when i face double melee lobbies quite a bit
[0:34:05] chubmax: boomy rough spot it seems
[0:34:07] famous1939: i play every heal and that just feels odd to me
[0:34:07] nikthevoker: also saw boomy hitting 450k new moon crits LUL

[0:34:50] ryanblue98: what about MW games
[0:34:52] it_weez: @famous1939 I noticed that, once I found the weakaura to maximize the time for it I did a lot better, still feels bad when its on cd though
[0:34:52] chancywilson: No thing makes you question why youre playing the game then getting flamed by a harstuck 1900 bm hunter in SS.

[0:35:00] grectheheal: hmm
[0:35:11] ferahgok: @Salanzo I notice the same on my boomy. We're heavily reliant on some level of passive tankiness if we can't spam clone. Def seem squishier
[0:35:20] chubmax: I think you have a vault to collect
[0:35:25] famous1939: @it_weez yeah agree, def have to max the uptime. then it's a little scary til it's back

[0:41:58] jayyArrington: the holy pally look ike he wasnt healing

[0:46:43] CHMage: do you press slow? @venruki
[0:47:11] CHMage: @jmonttheking they should remove glass cannon talent and buff other sources of damage. 700k hp feels dumb

[0:57:29] ParagonPlayer123: Malvarcla was just in my lobby with Bronzer (Bronzeflight-Stormrage) where Bronzer intentionally threw and started spamming emotes because he's already muted from reports... everyone go report, one less toxic boi in the game!
[0:57:42] gracioussatan: @kreyzy8 Garbanzo has

[0:58:26] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @portleys They neutralized the armor buff for locks so no
[0:58:34] dmicrl: oh look it’s buff Chad again. what a swell guy
[0:58:36] portleys: @atomic_gossipgirlxo oh thats good
[0:59:26] jmonttheking: they should make a pvp talent that makes poly not break to damage, but can be dispelled
[0:59:29] jmonttheking: would be good for shuffle
[0:59:51] ryanblue98: @jmonttheking sounds op

[1:10:36] foxyllama: Plz db him next game opener, out of stealth @venruki
[1:10:50] majacobosrs: Couldn't it be the other pvp trinket the removes it for you?
[1:10:50] zachgamegodx: @prtwentyfour ppl go lock bc they’re going to kill the whole team if you don’t … not bc they like bullying locks
[1:10:52] baxter5569: @erzo something you enjoy
[1:11:04] SteLawBro: Years down the road it comes out that a lot of these guys are bots to cut queue times and Blizzards AI was ahead of its time.
[1:11:07] Lazeeqt: ask him in chat
[1:11:07] foxyllama: Tell ur team to stand back
[1:11:07] PunishedLrnz: He stands kn same spot too, just beside ramp till enemy comes in range

[1:12:59] foxyllama: At this point just play adapt lmfao
[1:13:19] Gamarth_: that was my thought too - why bot your trinket when adapt exists
[1:13:25] xGriefxGodx: Good morning Venjamin

[1:15:43] Hobblefoot: One of my favorite songs.
[1:15:56] zachgamegodx: one thing I didn’t understand is why foxy lama said he was going to put all his mastery into crit and haste, why crit…..

[1:16:50] ryanblue98: the bots created by AI Kappa
[1:17:01] rekt1370: rank 1s been making money off the game for years
[1:17:04] OMGWhatsHisFace: They need to ask foxy for tips - the adapt trinket move was smarter than whatever that one had going on
[1:17:07] nightmxz: If the top players aren't making it then there's a lot of nuance that not top players wouldn't understand so yeah that checks out
[1:17:14] hogx: plenty of people pee in their own pool
[1:17:16] Cdenzy: are you trying to tell us some ven Susge
[1:17:23] kjjuu: Ven this is wow in 2024 not wow in 2014 no one cares anymore
[1:17:30] Outmageousx: they just assume that someone else will sell them the info anyway
[1:17:31] Mhortai: LOL
[1:17:35] Drathimos: i figured the bot makers just copied the default simming rotation

[1:27:47] SteLawBro: TThe knockback and stun in narnia on the healer was a good thought.
[1:28:01] Blitzylive: druid is spending too much time trying to cc instead of healing
[1:28:12] Blitzylive: literally just heal and you win
[1:28:22] WardenDOTA: most common druid mistake is trying to be too aggressive for sure
[1:28:47] thunderstud25: with conquest boxes now its pretty quick to get one geared!
[1:29:01] IIyena: its real fun til about 2.6 mmr then ppl actually cc demonic windows out the ass
[1:29:10] Blitzylive: devastation and DH is so much pressure!!
[1:29:12] gracioussatan: yeah def gear it up
[1:29:14] kritikos5: it is fun, i melt people
[1:29:15] SweatyDaniels: DPS players always know when the healer is doing too much or too little for CC, it's the best part about shuffle
[1:29:22] happyheals: I managed to heal through one of those rounds where it was dh ret vs mm and arms. I was doing 112k hps and going oom and holy pally only had to do 45k hps
[1:29:23] dankNstein_: The dev is cranking

[1:29:52] Mhortai: ha
[1:29:52] hamsti: LMAO
[1:29:59] OMGWhatsHisFace: i would do it to never play against dhs
[1:30:11] dankNstein_: I'd pay 30 a month to never play against locks
[1:30:12] Mhortai: Only applies to PvP? OR PVE TOO? that would be funny.
[1:30:15] hamsti: You know what would have made this lobby BIS.... if the DH was a tank too
[1:30:18] tannivah: Tank hate is always funny to me when there are dps specs that do what they do but bettter
[1:30:27] happyheals: I don't mind dh lobbies. They are fast and on to the next one
[1:30:33] volanto: Can anyone tell me if tab targeting is bad
[1:30:49] OMGWhatsHisFace: @volanto pika tabs. it's viable. worse maybe but viable.
[1:30:50] IIyena: frost mage demo lobbies are the absolute worst
[1:30:53] Pock3tsand: Heya Ven, have you considered choosing a new herbalism specialization to unlock?.......Please?
[1:30:57] hamsti: A ton of rank 1s tab target... is it suboptimal... ofcourse but who cares @volanto
[1:31:00] Sosatko: it’s so funny you can witness all their weakaura horns going off everytime you drop tide 😂
[1:31:02] Blitzylive: the last second warstomp lol
[1:31:22] WardenDOTA: its 2.1k lobby with a tank its like you are happy gilmore
[1:31:24] invincibledalyeth: he’s used rescue once with the ret
[1:31:26] johnnyquestz: new feature: heals get to control their dps defensives during solo  shuff
[1:31:36] happyheals: every time I see tank games on check pvp they have the highest winrate for the day, but only like 16-20 games vs 9-10k games of other specs
[1:31:48] hamsti: @johnnyquestz imagine the absolute griefing that would occur though
[1:31:55] Lazeeqt: SS is a waste of time if you are a healer
[1:32:02] johnnyquestz: @hamsti imagine the griefing that already does occur though :(
[1:32:07] hamsti: Fair
[1:32:07] SteLawBro: @johnnyquestz 900 keybinds later...
[1:32:10] NurseBenji: You just need to attach a scope on your heals
[1:32:12] sgtstarfox: i dont know if anything can keep up with DH cleaving.

[1:37:54] Snewch: I wonder if we'll see more Aug evoker soon
[1:38:03] johnnyquestz: what he means is please dont queue when anyone is playing

[1:38:17] Dwilk20: Where is the Spriest Qs lol?
[1:38:19] Blitzylive: I wished they brought back gladiator stance for warriors
[1:38:27] happyheals: gotta use smurf accounts to pvp on tanks

[1:43:13] MagickWarlock: good morning ven :) hows the weather in Calgary been? all our snow is melting in kelowna
[1:43:21] Volgi95: can we get mr brightside repeat once more?
[1:43:42] ezmoney3434: the song sounds like he is saying I neather like a DH does 😂
[1:43:49] What_ln_Tarnation: MW feels like they dropped in tier levels
[1:43:57] ezmoney3434: nether
[1:44:02] SolidDJ: clearly the healer
[1:44:03] VetisBR: true
[1:44:04] OMGWhatsHisFace: @What_ln_Tarnation i agree
[1:44:11] Pock3tsand: even if you lose, you win if you get top dmg
[1:44:11] johnnyquestz: rogue just geting melted every match up
[1:44:28] enviscerate: but i thought rogue was supposed to 6-0 every lobby
[1:44:46] rekt1370: thats outlaw
[1:44:48] IIyena: sub and outlaw
[1:44:51] OMGWhatsHisFace: @enviscerate i dont think argued that sin rogues dominate lobbies easily this season
[1:44:53] sgtstarfox: rogue kinda junk now huh
[1:44:56] sum_x: psychic scream is nutty now
[1:44:56] rekt1370: assa the only fair rogue spec
[1:45:20] enviscerate: @OMGWhatsHisFace idk i remember ven putting assa in the same tier as sub and outlaw (before this weeks nerfs)
[1:45:28] heho1231: does anyone know best totem to totemic recall ?
[1:45:31] heho1231: just started rsham
[1:45:39] OMGWhatsHisFace: @enviscerate oh, big if true (idk)
[1:45:40] Devcomz: @johnnyquestz yeah Assa extremely squishy healers hate healing them so I am told
[1:45:44] Ambersulfr: depends what you're qing into @heho1231
[1:45:48] Adessius: @heho1231 usually earthen
[1:46:13] zachgamegodx: It's avilable to subs only
[1:46:22] What_ln_Tarnation: love to see rogues losing
[1:46:34] Ambersulfr: if you're going to reset one all the time while you learn do earthen
[1:47:06] Devcomz: @What_ln_Tarnation If that happens on average too often you don't want that cause then they get buffed
[1:47:20] rekt1370: not playing void volley into double melee what a savage
[1:48:33] nikthevoker: i hate when SP/void volley is meta
[1:48:51] lilskeets: you're playing eye bbeam build?
[1:48:54] WardenDOTA: rogue 0-6 in dh lobby Pog
[1:49:02] lilskeets: yep
[1:49:12] lilskeets: trill build
[1:50:25] IIyena: lel
[1:50:36] atomic_gossipgirlxo: -199 now. Was that increased?
[1:50:38] gracioussatan: many such cases
[1:50:43] gachie_: whats hpal like compared to rdruid for a new healer in arena?
[1:50:45] Metaphors: why are people allowed to leave still
[1:50:48] CerebrillUK: healer with 2 wins must be FUMING
[1:50:48] Metaphors: blows my fuckin mind
[1:50:50] JmanOwnz: imagine being the healer there...who just got unlucky with the rogue on your team more rounds
[1:50:53] johnnyquestz: hes just gonna go post how rogues need buffs on the forums is all
[1:50:54] reczy__: Spriest shining tho
[1:50:59] lilskeets: take your beating like a man
[1:51:01] Devcomz: @atomic_gossipgirlxo yeah mut his mmr only go down by like 60 so his mmr will be ahead of his cr for easier climb.
[1:51:04] SolidDJ: was it the rogue?
[1:51:05] enviscerate: @johnnyquestz nerf assa tbh
[1:51:05] zachgamegodx: locturnal does that all the time
[1:51:05] WardenDOTA: time to make a leaver queue like dota has
[1:51:05] OMGWhatsHisFace: @JmanOwnz Sadge
[1:51:06] Devcomz: Which I thought they fixed but didnt
[1:51:07] sum_x: he had to preserve his massive mmr
[1:51:10] zachgamegodx: you dont hate him
[1:51:10] Thebearhots: Honestly the debuff for leaving should be 24 hours.
[1:51:11] jmonttheking: yea he lost 190n rating
[1:51:12] gracioussatan: even when I'm tilted af and gonna lose I'll just stick it out. literally doesn't take that long to get out
[1:51:20] jmonttheking: he didn't want to lose his mmr
[1:51:21] jmonttheking: lol
[1:51:28] Metaphors: why are people allowed to leave and preserve mmr
[1:51:32] Unarmd: it should give everyone 0 change. thats dumb
[1:51:40] Nachofez: Put on the elite set
[1:51:42] Metaphors: why do they instantly fix some things and not others
[1:51:47] Hobblefoot: I think they are pathetic babies and don't deserve to win at any game they play for the rest of their lives.
[1:51:47] zachgamegodx: grats
[1:51:52] tristalien: the classic "i'm not having fun so you can't either" mindset
[1:51:56] WardenDOTA: if you can leave and lose mmr then you could  just tank your own mmr they don't want that
[1:51:57] obviouslytai: horns kinda meh
[1:51:58] Devcomz: I actually thought Blizzard fixed that a while ago but I guess you can still preserve mmr when leaving
[1:52:12] maenkins: disconnects too?
[1:52:25] hotshotss11: quite the omegapoggers set you have there
[1:52:30] WardenDOTA: they need to have other punishments out of the game like leavers only play with leavers or you have to do some kind of community service to be able to q again
[1:52:30] rekt1370: why would people tank their mmr over and over to play at lower lobbies
[1:52:32] atomic_gossipgirlxo: People would definitely scuba to gear alts at start of season
[1:52:34] rekt1370: they also lose 200 rating everytime
[1:52:40] mizten: sometimes people have irl reasons too to just quick drop for something, being locked out for 24 hrs would be tough for that
[1:52:44] dmicrl: looking cute
[1:52:52] lilskeets: rings or neck
[1:52:53] gracioussatan: ring
[1:52:56] enviscerate: imagine if leaving gave an account wide minus rating but going offline kept you in the match
[1:52:57] gracioussatan: your rings are horrible I think lol
[1:53:02] Thebearhots: Seriously 24 hour debuff for straight up leaving. Can’t queue on that toon til tomorrow. Don’t be shitty tomorrow.
[1:53:07] Dragaar13: maybe after 4 games your rating is impacted?  still makes it painful to intentionally drop rating
[1:53:11] WardenDOTA: don't join a game if you will have to leave for irl reasons dude and if you do then 1 day waiting period isnt that big of a deal because it should be like once a year that actually happens
[1:53:15] lundbergmackan: How is holy priest after patch?
[1:53:22] gracioussatan: oh sorry lol, I thought they were the rings you start with with fresh L70 boost
[1:53:22] mizten: you clearly dont' have kids lmao
[1:53:42] boundric: life.......fines a way
[1:53:49] logantataryn: Affliction is absolutely wild in SS. holy man
[1:53:52] WardenDOTA: yea well then don't solo q, if you leave you literally waste like an hour of 3 other dps time, im not saying they should be banned or something but 1 day cd isn't that big of a deal
[1:53:53] IIyena: just stack punishment
[1:53:53] kone_malone: oooo what swords are those?!
[1:53:53] OMGWhatsHisFace: @mizten get kid owners out of mah vidya tysm
[1:53:56] OMGWhatsHisFace: (jk)
[1:53:56] IIyena: leave 1 game - 30mins
[1:54:00] IIyena: 2 games 1 hour
[1:54:03] IIyena: 3 games 12 hours
[1:54:09] Sosatko: the man couldn’t win 1 round as a rogue
[1:54:13] Sosatko: probably went to uninstall
[1:54:15] Devcomz: The worst is when people leave to exploit mmr for easier cr increase gains with easier lobbies
[1:54:16] Thebearhots: So one person’s personal life trumps 5 peoples’ time?
[1:54:19] OMGWhatsHisFace: queue dh: 2 hours. queue dh again: perma
[1:54:23] frefal13: @WardenDOTA And DCs?
[1:54:23] Yaycarrots: danRage
[1:54:24] Volgi95: rage quitting is the issue
[1:54:25] Asharnix: Anyone know if you can add an extra socket to the signet of titanic insight ring?
[1:54:27] Hobblefoot: I swear Ven we are kindred spirits. If I was 30 years younger I'd come have a beer with you. Baby rage... Truth!
[1:54:27] Cdenzy: have you seen soemoen do that irl
[1:54:37] atomic_gossipgirlxo: I've had games where my puppy just bathrooms all over the floor...
[1:54:51] rekt1370: nah you keep playing and let me get my pointos
[1:55:02] WardenDOTA: if you DC long enough to actually leave the game then it shoudn't be a common occurance. a 1 day cd is not that big of a deal for those rare emergencies
[1:55:06] Thebearhots: I get that life gets in the way. But if you’re supposed to be watching kids and you’re queueing solo instead, sort yourself out you know.
[1:55:08] Devcomz: I lost power in a solo shuffle then the other time I lost internet sucked felt bad for the other 5
[1:55:12] Pock3tsand: no it isn't, Solo Shuffle > Family
[1:55:13] nikthevoker: @Asharnix rings can only have 1 sockwet
[1:55:15] JmanOwnz: honestly i dont care if someone rage quits it's always gonna happen in any game, but you should get priority queue for the next round
[1:55:22] Asharnix: Thanks
[1:55:27] serratedlove: other pvp games have a disclaimer when you queue that a game could take up to x minutes and that leaving results in a penalty, wow should too
[1:55:28] Metaphors: @JmanOwnz agree
[1:55:39] ShaHugs: beefsha-tichondrius
[1:55:42] Juliio29: @metaphors aren’t you a healer? LUL
[1:55:43] atomic_gossipgirlxo: What armor type
[1:55:43] fawksito: im tank you can try on me
[1:55:44] Volgi95: @JmanOwnz is there no punishment for the rage quitter now?
[1:55:53] gone_wickedtv: ooooo nice van play dh 💪💪💪 i make one olso today 😎
[1:55:59] Metaphors: @venruki they make the next q faster for the people that got cancer
[1:56:07] rtee1__: do u think frost dk is in a bad state?
[1:56:11] stormya55: why is it that when you kill a elite or glad person 1vs1 wpvp. they come and talk smack that am 1.8 hardstuck....???
[1:56:14] IIyena: frost needs a rework
[1:56:14] rekt1370: @rtee1__  yes
[1:56:16] JmanOwnz: @Volgi95 no the punishment is losing cr.
[1:56:22] lilskeets: you can get big double death sweep essence breaks if you eye beam - essence break - death sweep - meta - deathsweep
[1:56:33] JmanOwnz: @Metaphors <3
[1:56:42] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Trenbologne gigachad weakauras
[1:56:57] abhorath: On his discord for subs
[1:56:59] Metaphors: no disrespect but thats such a dumb thing to say. I don't only play healer. and why would that trump the game actually being good
[1:57:03] IIyena: itsin his disc
[1:57:10] Ragdoll727: you know what is fun...wow with a controller....flying is so much fun

[1:57:47] lilskeets: eye beam - essence break - death sweep - meta - deathsweep
[1:57:53] Cdenzy: 🤓 askually venruki I play more than just healer ill have you know
[1:57:54] IIyena: u wanna try an get 2 sweeps in demonic windows. you prob cant get 2 when u essence break tho
[1:57:57] Snoogns: you should try the other talent, instead of momentum
[1:58:03] lilskeets: big borst
[1:58:05] Snoogns: BIIIG dam
[1:58:09] Chappypappy1: yea intertia is cool too
[1:58:16] IIyena: inertia clunky af
[1:58:19] Dwilk20: Mvq runs Inertia build
[1:58:21] Snoogns: bigger borst
[1:58:21] Applezbtw: https://wago.io/zvBHtkKQy/2
[1:58:22] lilskeets: you play inertia with the immo aura build
[1:58:26] lilskeets: not the eye beam build
[1:58:31] Applezbtw: @venruki
[1:58:33] Dwilk20: you can get back to back to back inertia buffs
[1:58:35] Chappypappy1: is just shorter stronger buff vs lower more uptime
[1:58:36] Snoogns: so you only get the buff after immolate > fel russh
[1:58:38] kusoneko: unbound chaos is after immo aura
[1:58:39] Snoogns: but it's more dam
[1:58:39] Dwilk20: with Mvqs build
[1:58:53] lilskeets: rofl
[1:58:55] nthday: xD
[1:58:55] rtee1__: KEKW
[1:58:56] Boruox: lol
[1:58:58] Vendetta_Noctis: yeah don’t use eye beam
[1:59:09] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Man plays DH for one day and becomes 2IQ
[1:59:15] Vendetta_Noctis: just use and cancel right away
[1:59:35] happyheals: it means use it right now imo
[1:59:40] Dragaar13: would it be you have the buff?
[2:00:01] happyheals: change the words
[2:00:01] IIyena: veng retreat and hunt also give momentum
[2:00:02] Dragaar13: oh no, intersting
[2:00:05] Dragaar13: *interesting
[2:00:06] IIyena: an u stack the duration
[2:00:18] renae69: if u need weakauras to play dh man idk
[2:00:23] lilskeets: momentum stacks too you can get like 20 secs of momentum by fel rush x2 hunt and veng retreat at start of game
[2:00:27] Cocoapuffs1: it 100% has
[2:00:34] Volgi95: I don't like addons in general
[2:00:37] SquidSosa: remove addons
[2:00:40] bingie69: ofc it has
[2:00:46] Dwilk20: They do add ons overhwelming for pvp are worse
[2:00:48] SquidSosa: if u need addons to make ur game good bad game
[2:00:48] IIyena: u dont need wa for momentum tbh youll passivly have it up enough
[2:00:49] mizten: hard agree in literally every part of the game
[2:00:49] Dashinqly: its so bad for the game because youre almost required to have them at this point.
[2:00:51] hennybound: is that even a hot take? i think a lot of pvpers agree WA lowers the skill gap
[2:00:55] Cocoapuffs1: if not removing they really need to limit weakauras some how
[2:01:08] Magottx: dh almost has a skillful  mechanic - WA takes care of that real quick
[2:01:09] steezehound: v true
[2:01:10] Volgi95: Telegraphing the game is not healthy
[2:01:11] mneYEP: do you find that a lot of your wants for the game move the game backwards?
[2:01:14] Gumjob69: i hate weakauras
[2:01:19] steezehound: Original s1-s4 of arenas was so fun
[2:01:21] Kolowavex: hello any qs ?
[2:01:30] banaa__x: !Drops
[2:01:31] Nightbot: VENRUKI has enabled Drops for the community! Watch and claim the rewards! Check your progress here: https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory
[2:01:32] lilskeets: the average skill of pvpers is way higher now than ever before too
[2:01:33] gracioussatan: the state of addons/weakauras means everyone is basically on autopilot
[2:01:34] abhorath: doesn't it come down to how fast you can proccess all the information on your screen?
[2:01:39] sgtstarfox: Toooo many sweaty people playing now
[2:01:42] Sosatko: it’s like I said In that 2k rsham lobby lol you can literally see their horns going off when you drop ride
[2:01:44] nutz_hang_uneven: wait you don’t like a scripted game?
[2:01:46] Applezbtw: if you need a healer for some 2s  i gotchu
[2:01:46] Sosatko: tide. it’s hilarious
[2:01:46] Asharnix: Weakauars do nothing if you don't know what the icons are
[2:01:47] Volgi95: @venruki Was there a similar push back when DBM was made?
[2:01:49] Cocoapuffs1: i remember the days of being able to trap people in stealth on their openers but now they just have an air horn go off before anything happens
[2:02:01] Drathimos: i dont think wows shitty default ui is an excuse for better gameplay
[2:02:10] Kogeta: people that still pvp in wow have been pvping (the vast majority)
[2:02:13] steezehound: WAY diff than it used to be
[2:02:15] Sosatko: depends how you define skill.  internal tracking was a huge skill cap
[2:02:18] Kolowavex: hasnt it always been that way?
[2:02:28] Locturnal_TV: im coming off dr in .5 get ready to pre
[2:02:28] Moobot: Latest video "PvP Rewards Are Still Too Hard To Get In Dragonflight, Data Shows" view it here: youtu.be/NSw9Imk5bec
[2:02:30] nightmxz: I don't use any weakauras to track enemy buffs / debuffs / abilities / drinking / any sound alerts :) only to make my own buffs easier to t rack
[2:02:32] JackOfAllApocalypses: "everyone"
[2:02:39] Metaphors: its bad
[2:02:39] Chappypappy1: air horns for big cds
[2:02:41] Chappypappy1: lol
[2:02:42] bwillyboy: I agree Ven
[2:02:44] Metaphors: league dont have that
[2:02:44] lilskeets: pandora's box though, no going back now
[2:02:47] no0therx: I remember times when swd sheep was high level play. Now all priests on 1600 are doing that
[2:02:49] Kolowavex: ive pretty much always quarterbacked my teams
[2:02:53] Dashinqly: the mies doesnt need those stinking weak auras
[2:02:54] JD_Yadig: who remembers stopwatch macros
[2:03:01] lilskeets: agreed
[2:03:05] Devcomz: Weakauras IMO is just GladiatorLOSSA but with Airhorns and visuals
[2:03:06] steezehound: @no0therx When i first saw it in WSVG I was like ohhhh snap
[2:03:07] SplitViewAskew: i agree. would rather not have it
[2:03:09] Sosatko: I mean 1700 people kill healing tide because 5 different airhorns go off lol
[2:03:10] hamsti: @venruki have you seen the prime sub changes? monkaS
[2:03:16] Kolowavex: uh hard yea but still we use to play w/o addons at lan so
[2:03:19] kustumtv: what was impressive was in BC when reckful and talb were doing that before the weakauras and addons
[2:03:20] IIyena: rogues without stun dr would have to actually count lmao
[2:03:23] Volgi95: Was there a similar reaction when Deadly Boss Mods was released during Wrath?
[2:03:25] Vendetta_Noctis: maybe a big reset after the world soul saga?
[2:03:42] iAmRiP: some of these weak auras sit on the border of skill and automation. they aren't playing for you but some of these addons give you the information at a faster rate than without them in arena. I think I would have more fun without them in the game
[2:03:42] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy mismic2 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:03:46] happyheals: I enjoy doing things for the first time without any info on it. You can't blame the sweaty Wow Lords for using allowable tools.
[2:03:47] AhrimanicRitualist: was cata
[2:03:49] kyphosis001: it’s not the addons fault that blizzard can’t provide the info needed to pvp like DRs and big cds used
[2:03:52] Deyconn: sup ven
[2:03:59] hamsti: https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/prime-gaming-revenue-guide?language=en_US#rate where the person who prime subs is from changes how much the payout from that prime subs is --- So like someone from turkey's prime sub only is a 9 cent payout now.
[2:04:13] Kolowavex: i think the whole community just got beter and less lazy
[2:04:16] Kolowavex: better*
[2:04:33] dprims8: ven did u ever play with Haivo
[2:04:43] JmanOwnz: problem with all the addons, is that it makes it hard for a new player to get into the game. I think the default UI for pvp needs a overhaul. Spent hours just setting up my cousin who was new to the game.
[2:04:44] bwillyboy: 100%
[2:04:45] nikthevoker: o shit doesnt that fuck alot of streamers
[2:04:45] malvarcla: players have definitely gotten better though
[2:04:47] eceria: The reduction against cloth armor now is only 3% physical
[2:04:53] DirtyYankee0: if you dont have addons you are  so behind
[2:04:58] eceria: while against plate is 10%
[2:05:00] knadam13: ideally the game should be played with no addons
[2:05:02] hamsti: So hope your fanbase is from somewhere that pays good KEKW
[2:05:05] jamesip87: i think addons shouldn’t be in the game at this day and age
[2:05:13] Dragaar13: its the same for world first raiding, the bosses are so insane due to the shot-calling and info available raiders
[2:05:27] Kolowavex: i mean you can be the one that speaks on this but back when you played from tbc - mop did healers have the communication they did today? especially people that still play like dew etc
[2:05:30] wicked_wizurd: the problem is wa feel necessary to track all the modifiers and dangerous spells that aren't obvious. like standing in earthen without a weakaura is rough
[2:05:32] Drathimos: the thing is the alternative - the default ui is trash. you cant just remove addons and leave the ui as is. look how much useless buffs plague the buff bar that you have to scan through just to look for the proper icon
[2:05:33] nikthevoker: @hamsti thats new right, doesnt that fuck alot of content creators LUL
[2:05:36] heymomimonttv: when im on ele shaman i have most awareness of arena. when i play warrior i get tunnel vision of the target :/
[2:05:42] hamsti: ya brand new just announced @nikthevoker
[2:05:47] hamsti: And yeah probably @nikthevoker
[2:05:51] happyheals: I did all BC content when it launched and there wasn't really any perceived necessity in the game until Sunwell for Externalmods for raid progression
[2:05:57] lilskeets: I was looking for a WA for my outlaw rogue to track rolls and this WA straight up tells you when to reroll/cast slice and dice/when to blade flurry in single target it's nuts
[2:05:59] pridez49: ya the weak aura for cc is insane
[2:06:06] joyrex_j9: its also makes it really easy to bait people
[2:06:09] pridez49: mine shows the cc and does the horn sound lol
[2:06:13] Dashinqly: @lilskeets yo link that thang
[2:06:17] JD_Yadig: thats why i never used gladiator lossa, its not fun
[2:06:17] Loutendo: Is WW monk good now?
[2:06:22] Dashinqly: @Loutendo very
[2:06:23] krisdahaka: weekauras should be removed from the game
[2:06:25] morbidly_obese_panda: thoughts on removing all addons from the game
[2:06:27] ShaHugs: I have a WA that just calls me an idiot when a teammate is in cc, makes life easy
[2:06:32] Sosatko: tracking all of that stuff internally was such a skill to imo but some ppl just refer to oh people were bad back then
[2:06:34] abhorath: Be the change you want to see in the world. Delete them all!
[2:06:44] lilskeets: @Dashinqly https://wago.io/Pd53s_NPU/119
[2:06:48] bwillyboy: They should build in key addons as features and clear the rest IMO
[2:07:00] Magottx: just got an insta que at 1900 lol
[2:07:00] malvarcla: the weak auaras they have for pve is just ridiculous
[2:07:08] Duzurix: well pve is designed now around ppl having them ..so pve players have no choice realy
[2:07:10] happyheals: I'm bad now
[2:07:21] kyphosis001: there is a right and wrong way to do it blasting a horn and making it super obvious sure is a little much but the default blizzard ui is complete dogshit give you no information I’m not gonna target my healer constantly to make sure he’s not in cc a little icon on his raid frame is enough and they don’t even do that shit sometimes
[2:07:23] hennybound: need AWC back on lan with WA disabled
[2:07:25] mismic2: i feel insta queue always results in prot pala heal
[2:07:25] What_ln_Tarnation: im tired of weakauras when are we getting strongauras?
[2:07:33] Chris7ka: The PVE community would implode without addons
[2:07:37] renae69: "back then" is only like legion right? wa started in bfa i think
[2:07:40] Juliio29: I legit play no addons, am multiglad ret I use details. people are always so amazed when I tell them. I do play hard more and am at an insane disadvantage, but I don’t complain about it. people want everything to be easy and that’s just the world we live in
[2:07:55] Chappypappy1: the addons would be so necessary if there wasnt so much shit going on tbh
[2:07:58] Bendix10: They should make it so you can only track your own buffs
[2:07:59] Chappypappy1: wouldnt *
[2:08:04] ShaHugs: did you grab the shuffle weekly?
[2:08:09] joyrex_j9: @Juliio29 details is an addon
[2:08:11] whspe: think they play 2 crafted
[2:08:14] lilskeets: the pvp rings arn't great too much vers not enough mastery
[2:08:22] happyheals: remember you can personally edit weak auras to change sounds and placement
[2:08:24] Juliio29: @joyrex_j9 yeah but it’s just to track damage
[2:08:33] Mhortai: I use two crafted because it's free sockets
[2:08:33] What_ln_Tarnation: pvp ring with master
[2:08:34] What_ln_Tarnation: y
[2:08:47] whspe: they play regular neck though
[2:08:51] What_ln_Tarnation: neck is good
[2:08:53] whspe: pvp mastery
[2:09:07] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Fury73 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:09:17] happyheals: you can get 5 crafted pieces in a day with how fast stuff drops
[2:09:21] Ionized4: as a pve player I love UI addons but most pve gameplay has turned into weakauras just telling you what to do, and it makes players worse because they depend on weakauras
[2:09:30] Fury73: Fury73 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[2:09:36] kustumtv: where do you see your self in 15 years?
[2:09:39] SplitViewAskew: yea world first guilds hire dedicated wa experts. thats how dependent they are
[2:10:00] lilskeets: rotation weak aura's are wack
[2:10:08] Devcomz: I will be playing wow in 15 years still if I havent quit already probably not going too
[2:10:11] Sosatko: shadowlands classic
[2:10:14] Metaphors: how many pots have u smoken?
[2:10:14] Sosatko: in 15 years 😂
[2:10:14] happyheals: naked in a Bojangles Parking lot eating biscuits
[2:10:16] Ionized4: ive had a lot of people do dumb things just cause weakauras told them to do it.  if they'd have looked at their screen, they'd not have done it
[2:10:17] Fury73: Excited for AWC next week!
[2:10:25] clayhendrix: venruki will be playing dragonflight classic in 15 years
[2:10:28] mizten: rwf isn't entirely dependent, it just frees up their mental for other stuff. it's the rest that really are dependent tbh. but yeah WA in pve are cursed too
[2:10:43] Endoraesh: you were such a degen then huh?
[2:10:45] mayonaes: confirmed 420 stream
[2:10:49] mayonaes: lets goooooooooooo
[2:10:51] klocksmith: not enough pots imo

[2:11:10] Metaphors: 420 conquest per win
[2:11:16] felgazer: Hey ven, Thoughts on the new patch so far?
[2:11:18] happyheals: nice
[2:11:26] Magottx: why am i 70 ms higher thannusual in every shuff since reset
[2:11:41] Metaphors: like what? :D
[2:11:41] Degenr8t: ret feels pretty poggers
[2:11:47] happyheals: and toolkits
[2:11:48] lilskeets: i feel like the changes were super half baked
[2:11:49] Metaphors: elaborate :D
[2:11:53] felgazer: AKA Dhs
[2:11:53] mayonaes: My thoughts are I am chillin until season 4 when things are going to get whacky and freaky
[2:12:09] kazekwow: I agree. Shadow priests aren't durable at all
[2:12:15] What_ln_Tarnation: DH at top
[2:12:22] mvpJ_: what are the best classes to hit in solos? idk who to target
[2:12:33] Metaphors: so what do we do about DKS
[2:12:33] Chappypappy1: yea im super curious what war within pvp will look like. Maybe some huge systemic changes coming?
[2:12:34] Metaphors: :D
[2:12:36] ShaHugs: blue/pink nameplates
[2:12:48] happyheals: Plate
[2:12:49] crazzbez: it's not damage, it's the pace of the game thats an issue
[2:12:49] knadam13: why do fire mages get 4 spellsteals per game and arcane gets infinite
[2:12:53] Metaphors: unholy should be l;ike frost
[2:12:54] Metaphors: :D
[2:12:56] gracioussatan: dampening is such a lazy mechanic that nobody enjoys
[2:12:57] knadam13: I thought arcane had to be worried about mana
[2:13:08] mayonaes: Think about when they have to balance hero talents on top of this stuff
[2:13:13] mayonaes: gonna get crazy
[2:13:23] malvarcla: @gracioussatan not really, think of a better system that would be more fair then, kinda hard to
[2:13:35] Jubite: i wish dampening worked in the inverse, and gave healers more damage
[2:13:37] What_ln_Tarnation: borngood should make a lock and name it bornevil
[2:13:37] happyheals: noone enjoys slowly getting wet from the rain
[2:13:42] gracioussatan: I agree it's necessary but only because of imbalances and immortality issues
[2:13:43] lilskeets: ele shams and locks love dampening
[2:13:43] Drathimos: dampening isnt fun to play or fun to watch
[2:13:45] Dashinqly: dampening + ms effects just feel soa wful
[2:13:49] ShaHugs: damp is too fast in shuffle imo
[2:13:56] Chappypappy1: @venruki you think arena templates should come back?
[2:13:56] Fury73: I remember the days of 45-1hr arena matches
[2:13:57] kustumtv: i see you moving to cali in 15 years lol
[2:14:11] happyheals: pre dampening was 45 minute games that ended in a draw
[2:14:11] Devcomz: Nerf the immortality aspects of specs but I am not a balance developer
[2:14:15] knadam13: games should end with proper cc and well coordinated gos
[2:14:17] jporter_: "ughh i hate one shots" and also "ugh i hate dampening"
[2:14:18] Jubite: turn dampening into healer damage so as game goes on healers arent punished
[2:14:23] luckydyldo: people complain that games are long and go to damp but imagine if there was no damp and games were 30 min long
[2:14:24] Chris7ka: I don't like the dampening mechanic but I don't really know what the answer is
[2:14:36] gone_wickedtv: van way you don’t play awc ? andhow to get in ?
[2:14:42] gracioussatan: maybe less immunity spells, more damage reduction instead idk
[2:14:43] enviscerate: @luckydyldo sounds like wrath arena :^)
[2:14:45] jporter_: lol so make mistweaver irrelevant?
[2:14:49] Dashinqly: dampening being a necessary evil is true. to see what no dampening looks like, tune into wrath arenas where a 1v1 turns into auto attacking each other until someones gear breaks lmao
[2:14:50] Vendetta_Noctis: how are demos after the change?
[2:14:53] OMGWhatsHisFace: @jporter_ seriously wtf
[2:15:00] Salanzo: honstly ur onto something there about the 500k moonfire
[2:15:02] nightmxz: They had that before, "The Crowd Chooses You" LMAO
[2:15:04] What_ln_Tarnation: what about caster mw that has 0 dam
[2:15:06] Bakbak4: I think if healers mana was throttled the right way there wouldn't be a need for damp. I know they can run out now, but it takes a decent time, and some classes can float at low mana for a long time
[2:15:09] Sosatko: dampening I agree is necessary evil but it’s due to poor design that it is necessary
[2:15:10] likeewlock: good that blizz dont take notes from chat
[2:15:16] Duzurix: we did have that in mop xD the crown damage buff to the team that get the enemy lowest..hail to the double blood dk era
[2:15:26] mayonaes: Dampening is required to allow for more win conditions.
[2:15:27] remmixx: In wotlk for example, 3s rarely goes for mor than few minutes. The consistent dmg is too hhigh and healers go oom, but at thhe same time, people don't get oneshot if they play well.
[2:15:33] jporter_: am i the only one who likes this patch? I wish some classes werent so tanky but theres always going to be imbalance
[2:15:33] Mhortai: I wonder if healers were more of a support instead of healing, like they all did damage but had healer and support stuff if you would need dampening. @venruki
[2:15:40] zachgamegodx: dampening is neccessary because pol will play lame asf to win
[2:15:50] happyheals: I had those games in BC where no one wins after 45 mins

[2:15:56] Chris7ka: Remember when it was called battle fatigueLUL
[2:16:02] Sosatko: Maybe yeah battle fatigue
[2:16:21] Magottx: that is the worst rule ever
[2:16:24] crazzbez: is that the turtle all day blizzcon
[2:16:24] Sosatko: yeah I forgot when that was a rule 😂
[2:16:24] happyheals: poeople hated my 2 holy pally and prot warr holy pally teams
[2:16:25] bump1: ven is the biggest believer in dampening
[2:16:27] Yaycarrots: DIDSOMEONESAYCOCK
[2:16:29] Sosatko: top damage won that was crazy
[2:16:30] gramljuna: 2x blood dk in MOP
[2:16:37] enviscerate: everyone has tiktok brain rot now and wants games to end in 30 sec
[2:16:40] mvpJ_: there are so many comps, some excel in dampening and some excel at ending games quickly. obviously there will be preferences both ways
[2:16:48] gracioussatan: horrifying
[2:16:48] Asharnix: Go to a epic bg and checkout the 5mill health unkillable bears just trolling the game, that's life without dampending. They got 30+ people attacking them and they can't be killed
[2:16:49] What_ln_Tarnation: WutFace
[2:16:50] morrs: I think you killed them and then they bragged because the arena had gone past the time.
[2:16:56] Chris7ka: That sounds horrendous
[2:17:04] Mhortai: AWC would be dead read now. Nobody would watch if games were like that LOL
[2:17:08] Sosatko: 😂
[2:17:11] undamned12: thats poor game design too
[2:17:11] CHMage: I dont like dampening as a solution. Healing and defensives are too strong @venruki
[2:17:12] st0rmsong: Less CC, More Dampening
[2:17:13] Sosatko: true
[2:17:17] Vultro: Yeah!
[2:17:18] malvarcla: glad none of yall are working for blizz
[2:17:24] Cdenzy: wrath gmaes are so weird it either takes 30 seconds or an hour
[2:17:25] Cvarks: u like the way the game feels now?
[2:17:31] Sosatko: WW arcane felt insane yesterday low key
[2:17:35] knadam13: its similar today with rdruid ret paladin 2s but at least the game will end
[2:17:37] renae69: @Mhortai awc is already dead?
[2:17:38] SquidSosa: chun devoker is nuts
[2:17:40] Cvarks: oh nah i was just asking in general
[2:17:41] luckydyldo: YEP
[2:17:43] Cvarks: not related to that
[2:17:54] Metaphors: the solution
[2:17:56] Vendetta_Noctis: WW are blowing plates right now.
[2:17:58] Lauroson: Anyone that thinks damp is bad, wasn't here before it was added.
[2:18:02] lilskeets: it's still not as bad as it was in BFA
[2:18:08] Rissla: How come u have 3 different blurs? See cd better?
[2:18:08] Metaphors: cooldowns need to be longer
[2:18:09] zachgamegodx: i have 1.2 m health on my outlaw rogue
[2:18:12] mvpJ_: you playing ww/mage with chun?
[2:18:12] jporter_: DH/DK cannot die to double caster it feels like
[2:18:12] zootsnloots: armor dampening would be fucking sick
[2:18:13] heymomimonttv: who is too tanky?
[2:18:14] Metaphors: defensively
[2:18:16] morrs: I remember 40 mins arenas in Cata where the diff factor was the WC :D x D
[2:18:19] ShawkTreatment: the only other option would be for healers to go oom instantly which also would be unfun for healers
[2:18:22] st0rmsong: I think there shouldnt be a CC that last more than 3 sec
[2:18:23] Metaphors: thats how u die w/o damp
[2:18:30] mvpJ_: have you played fire at all this season? ive heard from most people that itts the worst of the 3
[2:18:34] DirtyYankee0: DH are too tanky
[2:18:35] SquidSosa: spriest
[2:18:39] lilskeets: sub rogue too tanky
[2:18:41] Metaphors: for instance in league
[2:18:42] renae69: arcane mage
[2:18:42] mayonaes: sub rogue
[2:18:43] CHMage: dampening is bad design in my opinion. If no one dies it means healing and defensives are too strong. Adding a system that reduces healing overtime kinda sucks
[2:18:44] Metaphors: flash is 5min cd
[2:18:48] rekt1370: nah melee cleaves eat sprioest
[2:18:52] Ellynaria: demo lock
[2:18:56] Sosatko: Rogue is unkillable and when it does die it procs cheat death kekw
[2:18:56] gamtheory: Warlock lol
[2:18:59] rekt1370: go vs dh dk as an spriest tell me how tanky
[2:19:00] Cvarks: idk i played a game of 3s yesterday vs dh dk
[2:19:00] kazekwow: Uhhhh no to shadow priest
[2:19:00] fistweaveurnan: Blue is a borderline immunity on a short cd. DH isnt tanky, its busted
[2:19:01] Sosatko: well outlaw / sub
[2:19:02] Cvarks: i stood still all game
[2:19:04] Blitzylive: can't we just look at statistics and see which class/spec dies least in solo?
[2:19:04] Cvarks: and only got low once
[2:19:09] SquidSosa: @Sosatko real asf
[2:19:11] jporter_: ele feels tanky until theres double melee
[2:19:14] Cvarks: pres evoker
[2:19:15] crazzbez: you can't hit arcane?
[2:19:18] bump1: having a good healer right now makes everyone feel tanky
[2:19:29] Metaphors: nerf every defensive and mobility by 10 sec and watch ppl die w/o damp
[2:19:31] fistweaveurnan: @Blitzylive Yes its DH
[2:19:33] bump1: low rated players still die cuz healers are just bad
[2:19:38] lilskeets: that's a good point, arcane mage, sub rogue, and DH are unkillable not because of stam and armor but because of strong short CD's
[2:19:44] hennybound: kinda sucks how meta's are just whatever classes / comps r the most tanky
[2:19:51] reczy__: Just stack vers haste and press flash heal and boom, you Live against melee. Doing damage on the other hand tho....
[2:19:52] lilskeets: arcane is more mobility than CDs
[2:19:53] wow_revan: @venruki Do you know why gear change stats when make it SET ? I got legs witgh Mastery and when i transform it it show haste
[2:19:54] jporter_: I dont even target dh as ele, just keep a flameshock on him
[2:19:58] wow_revan: No mastery at all
[2:20:00] DirtyYankee0: dh is tanky because of  -15 magic resistance + cdss @lilskeets
[2:20:07] Brotana: Even with a 10% aura nerf DH would still be OP it's nuts
[2:20:08] DirtyYankee0: +15% I mean
[2:20:10] fistweaveurnan: @DirtyYankee0 Pr sure its 20
[2:20:15] Evoca85: I tried healing in pvp for the first time. It's just too hard, big respect for any healers that pvp
[2:20:15] DirtyYankee0: its 15
[2:20:20] Mhortai: @wow_revan Tier has set stats
[2:20:21] jporter_: why do they have all that magic resist just built in passively? I dont understand it
[2:20:21] mirajhtv: @bump1 low rated players often die, bc of bad positioning ;)
[2:20:28] trottiga: @Blitzylive Check wowarenalogs, look at spec performance and first blood
[2:20:48] fistweaveurnan: @DirtyYankee0 no its 20
[2:20:50] Mhortai: When you transform your gear it changes it to the same stats the PvE gear has. @wow_revan
[2:20:51] DirtyYankee0: demonic wards + illidari knowledge talent @fistweaveurnan
[2:21:01] DirtyYankee0: where are you getting 20 from? @fistweaveurnan
[2:21:17] mayonaes: Funny enough the healer i had the easiest time with in 3's and solo and got 2.2k+ on was mistweaver. they are very straightforward and their cc is easy to land
[2:21:20] wow_revan: @Mhortai But the gear was with Mastery for PvP when i got it from the vendor im confused
[2:21:41] Itankarenas: healing in pvp has a high skill floor, so it's harder to get into than even mid level keys
[2:21:45] SquidSosa: dark pact gotta be one of the most annoying warlock cds
[2:22:16] What_ln_Tarnation: tauren locks too strong
[2:22:44] WardenDOTA: feral dies first 75% of the time in 2100+ KEKW
[2:22:57] Itankarenas: this cow casting chaos bolts is triggering me
[2:23:10] frefal13: @wow_revan Tier gear has specific stats, when you turn your gear into tier gear you change that stats. You are basically getting rid of whatever piece you used and getting a PvP version of the tier piece instead
[2:23:11] dankNstein_: LMAO that warlock
[2:23:29] Blitzylive: spriest was not focusing
[2:23:30] dankNstein_: warlock gets grip saved, ports 5 feet away from healer and sprints back to the middle of the map melee range
[2:23:33] Vendetta_Noctis: lol
[2:23:36] Itankarenas: nah, DH/Lock
[2:23:36] kazekwow: Huh the priest died
[2:23:36] VonVantham: what do you do for no copyright music?
[2:23:38] Itankarenas: u guys got this
[2:23:38] reczy__: Lock is boosted lmao
[2:23:54] dankNstein_: that was the funniest thing ive seen in a long time
[2:23:58] Itankarenas: DH/Lock vs double priest..
[2:24:10] bagofcans88: Melee dropped off the face of the earth?
[2:24:10] five_moke: got I hate when you grip or “rescue” someone and they run right the fuck back in
[2:24:11] reczy__: That tauren lock with Santa outfit
[2:24:13] wow_revan: Ah ok, Thanks
[2:24:37] Cdenzy: catJAM
[2:24:47] bagofcans88: Is holy much better after change?
[2:24:55] Itankarenas: massive CC chain. might as well be a rogue at this point
[2:24:57] fistweaveurnan: @DirtyYankee0 8% magic reduction against enemies hit by a sigil.
[2:24:57] Itankarenas: Kappa

[2:25:15] Itankarenas: did they just double swap?
[2:25:15] Bombdiggity3315: the double swap
[2:25:18] Itankarenas: KEKW
[2:25:18] jporter_: oh man, the double swap
[2:25:20] DirtyYankee0: What talent is  that? @fistweaveurnan
[2:25:45] renae69: they should make all roots attackable like that
[2:25:54] IIyena: sp doing a good job saving cc for demonic
[2:26:03] Keybex: what gladius is this? my normal one is bugged so gotta get a new one

[2:26:34] DirtyYankee0: I have never heard of a talent giving you 8% magic resistance againsst enemies hit by a sigil it doesnt exist @fistweaveurnan
[2:26:42] Itankarenas: told ya EZ Clap
[2:26:44] IIyena: ^ there is
[2:26:45] twinkieruler95: @venruki have you got the experience of a tank solo shuffle? those are dumb
[2:26:45] Mulletmania1: I thought they buffed shadow priests!?
[2:26:46] escadaily: lmao the doubleswap!
[2:26:58] lilskeets: yea that double swap was epic

[3:30:16] happyheals: The monk weaved the mist to make that design for you
[3:30:33] gracioussatan: I'm trying to reconcile the numbers I'm seeing in their game. makes no sense
[3:30:35] happyheals: yeah
[3:31:06] zemm8582: demo is the most obnoxious spec in the game
[3:31:09] zemm8582: its miserable to play against them
[3:32:28] leon8221: did locks really get an armor nerf with the changes?
[3:32:36] Mhortai: @leon8221 yes
[3:32:42] fazedoritoss: is foxy back??
[3:32:46] kfree100: mr ven what would you say is best 2s comp for arcane ?
[3:32:50] Salanzo: FYI people are already running double demo ruining the game
[3:32:55] gracioussatan: you kind of moved health bars this time
[3:32:59] awfulist: Tell Chun we need Dudecow
[3:33:00] gracioussatan: at least the druid's
[3:33:05] Hellcx: chun seems like the chillest dude
[3:33:05] awfulist: Dudecow + Venfuki

[3:33:24] soothingmistmonk: I swear you guys could train healers on every go
[3:33:32] gracioussatan: I don't get how yours guys' damage is better than theirs, druid doing less heals than foxy, yet nobody is going below 100% hp
[3:34:01] zemm8582: a lo tof that damage is cleave on pets too
[3:34:03] kfree100: what would you say is best 2s comp for arcane?

[3:41:29] LifeOfDanDotMe: surely the armour changes are a precursor to a major rev of class defensives? Seems like a change that needs many other small changes to make sense.

[3:52:53] Sanderslant: are dh the most easy class?

[4:07:02] finnybae: lmao
[4:07:17] pkSerafin: UA hits for about 330k normal
[4:07:50] pkSerafin: and with aff locks 6% crit chance you most likely won't get those 700k+ dispells
[4:08:07] rekt1370: ua cant crit anymore
[4:08:13] rekt1370: ua dispel
[4:08:24] pkSerafin: seriously ?
[4:08:26] rekt1370: yup
[4:08:31] magnesiium1: correct. ua cannot crit anymore
[4:08:37] magnesiium1: thats why it hits so ahrd normally
[4:08:38] rekt1370: just hits hard regardless tho
[4:08:46] happyheals: so it is a stable affliction now
[4:08:54] magnesiium1: you could say that LUL
[4:09:01] rekt1370: this aff doing no damage
[4:09:10] ItsJhelo: Ua hits for like 300k on dispel Id say thats still pretty hard lmao
[4:09:12] pkSerafin: dunno healers dispel ua like crazy, at least in 2s
[4:09:24] rekt1370: yea 2s its easier but eventhat they can die easy
[4:10:21] magnesiium1: got hoj grounded KEKW
[4:10:22] McLarge: Hello Ven. I see you're playing Ret/DH. Are you enjoying the comp? I've played it a bit and it feels really strong into other cleaves. Haven't fought enough Wizards to get a feel for those matchups, but I expect it to be a bit harder

[4:12:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah shadow priest is back to being mean

[4:14:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Awesome
[4:14:05] happyheals: you almost got reported
[4:14:50] McLarge: Ret/DH/RSham should do really well into Shadowplay, I think. It's pretty impossible to CC the Shaman through Ground, Shear, Tremor, Sanc, and Reverse
[4:14:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Get frogged!
[4:15:08] happyheals: Key takeaway: No comms needed to win with comp
[4:15:20] Chappypappy1: honestly ret in pve is soo easy but in pvp you have a lot of utility it can be kinda hard to use well

[4:16:38] happyheals: Blizz still feeling guilty after making them irrelevant for almost 2 expacs to start the franchise
[4:17:17] BossmanRitz: Mages are too damn squishy its not fair. Either make all classes super squishy or fix mage. Makes the class so cancer to play
[4:17:21] kh9911: guys what better to play as alt reti or dh
[4:17:38] Chappypappy1: NOOO right as you said that i knew you forgot you changed off of blind LOL
[4:18:42] happyheals: Mages have like 10 things to do to get away
[4:19:07] BossmanRitz: @happyheals doesnt matter when one hit from a ret kills you
[4:19:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rets need a leap!
[4:19:08] Asharnix: What gear are using? your vers looks really low
[4:19:15] EjaVuDay: yeah blind
[4:19:15] McLarge: @kh9911 They're both very strong alt specs. I'd recommend whichever looks more fun to you. Ret is more durable baseline, but less slippery so it may be more likely to get trained in Shuffles. DH is also a lot harder to play into Rogues since you have to actively try to outplay them.
[4:19:31] EjaVuDay: @wEiRdO_dUdE we dont need a leap we have DS
[4:20:03] morrs: turn off your brain and you will become a true ret main :P

[4:20:51] McLarge: @kh9911 If you main a WW right now, DH would probably feel pretty similar.

[5:19:14] orcrimmar: I feel like people try to play like the pros too much and track every single ability ever made and then get overwhelmed with icons and clutter that you don't even know where to look
[5:19:29] zachgamegodx: meanwhile ppl can use best possible ui and be 1500
[5:19:29] soothingmistmonk: How are you tracking your clear casting procs? Is it a weakaura?
[5:19:29] abhorath: Dannycarrys mods are insane
[5:19:36] zachgamegodx: think wa is overrated
[5:19:51] Ronsimus: addons should be removed from arena
[5:19:58] gdodmebxu: i think WA needs disabled in arena
[5:20:00] Ronsimus: and they should improve the ui
[5:20:03] ItsJhelo: take addons out of arena
[5:20:04] gdodmebxu: makes telegraphed classes miserable
[5:20:06] DeityRevert: wasn't that because he was forced to due to no addons allowed in tourneys before?
[5:20:09] Koraszdormu: I think the only thing I track is a couple of my own buffs, and trinkets.  If I track anythign else, I get sensory overload.
[5:20:09] ItsJhelo: out of awc for sure
[5:20:12] morrs: I wasn't criticizing. I was thinking if you just keep it at the back of your head or just try to align it with some of your spells :). I don't like a lot of addons too
[5:20:12] hcrzealot: I love your UI @venruki simple and clean!!!
[5:20:12] pattarx: @gdodmebxu if they do that there would just be another addon
[5:20:14] rekt1370: gotta do something with totems cause without weak auras you cant see shit
[5:20:15] zachgamegodx: Danny carry is a computer guys
[5:20:34] SweatyDaniels: all you need is details to see big dam
[5:20:36] ItsJhelo: People really do load into WoW and let the game play for them they have so many addons
[5:20:39] happyheals: Some people probably do,  but when youare used to seeing trinkets, def cds, and buffs and debuffs it sucks when you are playing blind
[5:20:48] AndiWache: i think many streamers use gladilossa, but idk as a viewer you cannot hear it often
[5:21:16] Kikrino: @venruki Could I link you a tune? Dunno It might be to "hard" for you... Hardstyle/frenchcore style :]
[5:21:18] rekt1370: yea lol
[5:21:20] Koraszdormu: Need 100% haste or why even bother, amirite?
[5:21:21] ThePlaybookWorks: NO
[5:21:26] ThePlaybookWorks: we need MORE!
[5:21:36] Interzention: 44% haste sounds like bfa levels of haste
[5:21:37] rekt1370: doesn't it get dr big time after 40
[5:21:41] Noxalis20: i run 55 on my frost mage
[5:21:48] zachgamegodx: let’s say  you got an addon that tells you enemy warrior used csmash but you got to disarm him only to see he’s bladestormed, weak auras aren’t fool proof at all and honestly makes ppl worse if they never actually learn
[5:21:50] zybexx42: need bfa perma 250% haste as a destro lock
[5:21:52] nakitaredbeard: hey chat, any idea when this season ends?
[5:21:54] Jiviex: Mitch jones says you should stack mastery.
[5:21:54] Koraszdormu: Remember corruptions and having giga haste as Fire for Greater Pyro?  Oh how I miss the VenZiqo Wake and Bake Pie shop...
[5:21:58] Noxalis20: sometimes it to much lol
[5:22:05] happyheals: feels like thinking you have mastery and a frost dk is running 89%
[5:22:41] ItsJhelo: too many addons is a snoozefest
[5:22:46] happyheals: mine said Zug Zug whoosh whoosh
[5:22:49] quantumtako: how you feeling about the changes ven?
[5:22:53] rekt1370: you see all the rank 1s have that addon or weak aura that they see every gcd every person presses

[5:23:09] ThePlaybookWorks: are we a tank now after patch? :)
[5:23:14] zachgamegodx: can make a weak aura for incoming grapple weapon to but yeah it’s a little bit of both intuition and wa I suppose
[5:23:25] plagueghoul: I play my warrior with no weak auras since it's so easy, but when it comes to dk I do have some weak auras to keep trackof plaguebringer and buffs
[5:23:27] eyah: hows frost feeling elliot
[5:25:05] OGaxelaw: just watched the wow pvp hack vid and jeesus was that rogue kick spam cheat crazy to think exist.
[5:26:33] rekt1370: rogue mage legit feels like they just do go's the whole game

[5:28:22] Koraszdormu: I hate RMP with such a passion.

[6:06:13] chrisiirc: i dont think so, ww is chalked
[6:06:16] drfeltgood: @venruki is Arcane more impressive when compared to Frost mage to learn Arcane if I have frost down?
[6:06:16] JNCslasher: rogues can control the game so much they are needed in 3s
[6:06:17] whitewallss: boomy was just getting crushed
[6:06:23] whitewallss: yes
[6:06:23] Yourmaws: @venruki Serious question. A human and a chimp is in the Octagon, fight to the death and the human has a Bowie knife. Who is winning?

[6:07:27] drfeltgood: So Holy Preist runs Mastery over haste?

[6:08:05] Mortammer: have you noticed the armor increase on mage or is it sorta negligible?
[6:08:05] kcamptko: wym
[6:08:06] betasoldier: A chimp can literally rip your arms off of your body and beat you to death with it. You ain't beating a chimpanzee with a fucking bowie knife.
[6:08:07] jugganautjoe: grizzly wwould forsure lose to a elephant
[6:08:08] kcamptko: chimps are small
[6:08:14] weevinx: grizzly bear vs me. I win ez
[6:08:15] The__Swordmaster: I think that an average 25-35 year old male with a knife beats an average chimp 6/10 times, but with severe damage

[6:08:48] JmanOwnz: see man it's a tough one lol
[6:08:50] Datguyjay: hippos are enormous
[6:08:51] zen_oni_shinobi: crocodiles will not die of old age.  they never stop growing and have no known predators.  in fact they get so big they cannot sustain their own dietary needs and end up dying of starvation.
[6:08:53] DeityRevert: dude hippos are nuts
[6:09:03] drfeltgood: ^'4 235 agaisnt what animal?

[6:09:09] Shaken1: male hippo weights 4000 lbs and grizz is like 600
[6:09:12] betasoldier: A chimpanzee is smaller height wise but is almost ALL muscle dude.
[6:09:13] ItsBees: The hippo is one of the largest mammals on Earth. On average, males weigh 3,500 to 9,920 pounds and females weigh 3,000 pounds. On average, a hippo's length is between 10.8 and 16.5 feet, and their height is up to 5.2 feet tall at the shoulder.
[6:09:15] JmanOwnz: i think next to mosquitos hippos kill the most people per year too
[6:09:16] jugganautjoe: a toddler chimpanzee would beat jon jones
[6:09:17] chaosemperor77: i could take out a sloth easy
[6:09:23] chrisiirc: king cobras are even small and i think 6 foot 4 wouldnt help you

[6:11:18] ZEXbbot: theres something about the biology of chimps muscles
