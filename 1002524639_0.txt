[0:56:47] Ribbwich: @A_Klimas I feel like that might have been intended, they nerfed leveling and made something that benefits from someone having lots of mains.
[0:56:47] Quimby54: @MrEvilRex a daily cd on conduit energy keeps you grinding? lol what

[0:57:34] MrGattz: great! thanks chat
[0:57:40] MrGattz: cohhMVP
[0:58:03] Ribbwich: then whats the problem lol just the theoretical limit?

[0:58:39] Thoreya: bc i pvp and pve everyday
[0:58:47] Thoreya: idgaf about soulbinds. i care about conduit switching
[0:59:00] A_Klimas: It'd be nice if each spec on a character could just have seperate loadouts for each soulbind
[0:59:14] Scarok: if AV didnt have an hour queue you could go for an ISB

[0:59:46] datswassup: i just noticed lirik is part of the hammer squad, hope u guys are still chill. OG's
[0:59:53] Ribbwich: I don't think adding free switching would hugely change anything, but, I feel like there are more glaring problems then just conduit switching
[1:00:05] derElten: yup

[1:02:08] jasonx282: in alterrac mountains at the entrance
[1:02:23] Ribbwich: hot-take, Blizz did better when there were less eyes constantly metricing everything they develop.
[1:02:41] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee the quest is in the alterac mountains, not in the bg
[1:02:42] geokouts: at the AV spot outside the dungeon
[1:02:43] andTHISiswhat: B4 u enter
[1:02:55] jasonx282: its just north of taren mill

[1:07:07] Thoreya: shud be fun tho
[1:07:28] andTHISiswhat: i just came back to the game an RaiderIO is new to me. Trying to figure out how to up my IO
[1:07:32] Blvdman: its gunna be very worse, literally gunna expose you lol
[1:07:42] pkLeech: did RIO already announce they will abort their system and 100percent rely on blizz internal rio?

[1:08:27] Whoracle1337: show*
[1:08:30] mwchaos: well blizz didnt say anything yet about the implementation of an actual leaderboard right? thats one big that rio has over it
[1:08:31] pkLeech: then we just call it "BS" (blizzscore) LUL
[1:08:32] Blvdman: I do hope they don't make the complete a 20 in time for the teleport to the dungeon an actual thing
[1:08:41] Blvdman: Lots of abuse could happen with such a thing
[1:08:52] Thoreya: i think the more high end players will still use raiderio
[1:08:54] Skizzurp: raider io just really needs to weigh the affixs differently than across the board 1 rating per key level

[1:10:33] andTHISiswhat: Yea its pretty much a Rating for M+
[1:10:34] Funderik: i'm fine with that
[1:10:44] theoriginalzinng: they alway tune things up to match gear level increases @StoicTaurus
[1:10:47] Shwayze24: yo
[1:10:57] Thoreya: makes it much easier to do rewards too
[1:11:05] theoriginalzinng: a 15 today will be most likely around an 11 come 9.1
[1:11:07] Thoreya: to implement rewards
[1:11:12] pkLeech: but tbh - their MDI already felt like they are preparing to take the step towards leaderboards maybe?

[1:12:19] romere_db: noob here - what is MDI?
[1:12:26] pkLeech: mythic dungeon inv
[1:12:30] Inishima: New Challenge for Rextroy: +30Key for the +15 Acv
[1:12:33] Layercake: i have the same felling ...they need to change something
[1:12:37] romere_db: Thanks @pkLeech
[1:12:39] submotion: dont think thats happening tbh
[1:12:52] xiamrs: mdi is boring
[1:12:53] PrimogenitureJ: great push still sounds like you birthin a turd
[1:13:02] A_Klimas: I don't think the great push will draw that big of a crowd, the stakes are too low.
[1:13:11] zoovthepally: Had a steak last night. Great push this morning for me.
[1:13:12] Holysal: @xiamrs yeah if you dont like speed runs it is
[1:13:13] DrSoosh: oh man this flight path is giving me hemorrhoids lmao
[1:13:15] Ribbwich: The Ocho

[1:13:25] pkLeech: m+ leaderboard with rewards for top 3/top 5 for end of season (transmog/mounts) is definitely a "blizztype" thing, see diablo3 etc..
[1:14:21] mwchaos: YUP
[1:14:27] Skizzurp: well if i can get higher points doin git then more people will
[1:14:32] Korupcija_: even after nerfs tyrannical is dog shit
[1:14:32] Blvdman: As long as they stick with +15s being the max they support. Anything higher means they'd have to adjust specs alot more as it seems "High burst damage on low cd" is the current meta
[1:14:49] alundrius: cough the maw cough
[1:14:50] Ribbwich: @Towelliee yeah and if we still don't like it they put important rewards on it
[1:14:55] Hellbenderer: maybe they dont have better ideias
[1:15:08] ElPolloBatman: like stan lee forcing the thing into the batmobile in that simpsons episode
[1:15:09] Skizzurp: tyrannical really does weed out a lot of people tho .
[1:15:11] pockit_7: blizzard always has their own vision with their game and they don't like being told its wrong
[1:15:14] Zansteh: right
[1:15:15] Holysal: blizzard is stubborn for some reason
[1:15:16] Zansteh: wron way
[1:15:20] darkscream181: on the right

[1:15:22] samzavin: They already paid for it...    Your gonna like with the green weenie...
[1:15:22] pkLeech: i am sure theyll keep counting after +15
[1:15:25] Ribbwich: In somethings @pockit_7
[1:15:50] HeyDeMuu: I think the bad part of the RIO addon though is, that a lot of people either don't bother to update daily and that probably most of the people don't look online. So even if I'd done three +18s on a certain day I might not get invited anymore cause I still have those show up as, say, 16s. So maybe the built-in system improves on this side at least.
[1:15:51] Blvdman: Way too much
[1:16:08] Blvdman: Keep dodging keep nerfing POGGERS
[1:16:08] RocketMan23: thats human nature, nobody wants to be wrong, especially on something you are passionate about and have worked hard on
[1:16:18] TheCliffyShow: I actually like Sanguine Depths.
[1:16:21] Korupcija_: SD is easy now but people still dodge it
[1:16:24] Tyrsfal: Do you think fresh blood is needed in the areas where decisions are made though? How many more expansions does that same pendulum need to swing so much
[1:16:25] Ribbwich: @Towelliee expacs need longer and bigger betas
[1:16:44] KaisenSiru: They don't know how to counter the mechanics is why. They would rather complain than adapt
[1:17:05] Ribbwich: WoW needs to spend more time and get with more QA before expansions come out
[1:17:05] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:17:05] pkLeech: shouldn't the score depend on your own performance within a m+ dungeon? feels like, some ppl might get punished for low score, even tho they are good players?
[1:17:18] Ribbwich: and we as wow fans need to be okay with longer dev cycles
[1:17:26] sindrellaman7: its' the follow-up quest
[1:17:27] Flubbinen: You get the spear from the follow-up. Its just a turn in after the kill quest
[1:17:37] sindrellaman7: after defeating Vanndar you just speak to him again and get it
[1:17:38] kowaikoro: @pkLeech people would int and go for overall dmg or smth like that smh
[1:17:42] pkLeech: true

[1:18:21] pkLeech: but thats hard to achieve, either its a group thing, or not
[1:19:10] kowaikoro: find an guild or friends at similar rio to play with HYPERS
[1:19:25] Skizzurp: some of the issues also are them nerfing the drums and removing the scrolls so comps are like so much more important and not every class can run

[1:20:06] Connectus: Interested in the interview, see you're prepping for TBC? :D
[1:20:10] Xsilentghost: no way he talks about patch cycle plans
[1:20:14] luckfore: like asmon tweeted, they will wait until patch 9.3 until they fix the problems
[1:20:19] zoovthepally: Are they bringing back timed torghast now I thought I saw something about that
[1:20:19] sapmyballs: na Alliance basically get farmed :D
[1:20:24] mwchaos: nah its meta'd for horde
[1:20:26] Hybridwarhawk: Assuming there is a 9.3
[1:20:34] LecterSRK: nah its imbalanced so horde usually wins in 10 mins
[1:20:50] Ribbwich: yeah it was changable a year ago and they didn't before
[1:20:55] casualfury: nah last patch is 9.2
[1:21:04] satanic_viewer: do you think wow is drifting off?
[1:21:16] kowaikoro: fuck conduit energy
[1:21:17] pkLeech: if they keep the schedule with patch, 9.2 will be pre-patch for 10.0 LUL
[1:21:36] DiranJei: I only played for 2-3 months in SL. The fuck is a ripcord
[1:21:39] Remdain: wait, they are considering removing covenants??
[1:21:39] TheCliffyShow: I think they should stick to their guns with covenants.
[1:21:43] HeyDeMuu: WoW is a huge software project. They've already planned far into what's coming up and put systems in place. It's not as easy as to just change some checkboxes and we're good. People don't see this part
[1:21:45] naughtyforyou: the wow killer seems to be coming every new year
[1:21:48] luckfore: 9.1 is the perfect oportunity for easy covenant swapping with the covenants working together etc
[1:21:50] andTHISiswhat: The problem is Blizzard set such a high bar that they are having problems reaching the bar
[1:21:54] warrenny: @diranjei Freely swap covs
[1:22:02] Ribbwich: yeah they are always having to be on the cutting edge all the time
[1:22:05] Xsilentghost: do u think they need to hire more people?
[1:22:19] ElPolloBatman: draenor is also a good example of how blizzard can manage to drag and disappoint with content patches
[1:22:21] submotion: i feel like the only game that could ever compete with wow might be the riot mmo, but we know nothing about that so far so yea...
[1:22:30] Korupcija_: they're lucky raids were fire in WOd
[1:22:48] satanic_viewer: with the amount of money the got from stocks, blizzard/activision have the potential to make the best games of this generation. They just gotta be more cohesive
[1:22:51] TheCliffyShow: I think Blizzard should stick to their guns with covenants.
[1:22:58] satanic_viewer: they*
[1:23:01] Ribbwich: @redut lol i've stopped playing because of how I have to continuously defend WoW, on WoW.
[1:23:12] PadidinJones: I mean freely swapping covenants removes the meaningful choice aspect and just says all bets are off
[1:23:28] Hybridwarhawk: I just got my AOTC 3 weeks ago
[1:23:29] submotion: no way lol
[1:23:35] HeyDeMuu: there are even people who never go further than LFR
[1:23:36] Turguson: plenty of content
[1:23:44] luckfore: lol
[1:23:48] KaisenSiru: Of course there are. People fail to acknowledge the lower end of player skill.
[1:23:52] pavepawns: i found mythic shriekwing and huntsman easier then sire hc D:
[1:23:53] XarkoLP: the strugglebus. i lough every time i hear this name KEKW
[1:23:54] Thoreya: game has a lot of fluff, not enough meat tho
[1:23:55] Turguson: WoW is great because it offers so many things for so many different type of players.
[1:23:55] Thoreya: imo
[1:23:57] TheCliffyShow: The guild I'm in is now starting work on Mythic. We got Shriekwing down.
[1:23:59] cbreeezy: Lol I just got AOTC last night
[1:24:00] kowaikoro: must be insanely hard for wow devs to balance content between world first 226ilvl raiders and casuals at 210ish ilvl
[1:24:00] luckfore: i was done with the content mid januari
[1:24:01] casualfury: LUL
[1:24:02] caputinotv: Nathria is great, people just go and repeat what burned out top players complain about, there won't be a perfect raid for them
[1:24:05] casualfury: same
[1:24:12] INinjaBladei: INinjaBladei subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[1:24:31] twisteddeer: hi ! i'm new here and wanted to say i like you'r stream and you as a streamer
[1:24:32] Ribbwich: @redut i mean, no one does, obviously. The cognitive dissidence is a pet peeve of mine i guess.
[1:24:33] stratiss: I think this forumla for WoW would be fine, if content came out quicker
[1:24:33] PadidinJones: @Towelliee you got everything? Now you can play the game.
[1:24:35] naughtyforyou: what happened to that game that was meant to kill wow this year, asmond ect were hyping it for ages
[1:24:48] warrenny: Done with raid hc but trying to get ksm
[1:24:54] naughtyforyou: new world or w/e it was
[1:25:01] goosejamss: @naughtyforyou_ New World coming out later this year
[1:25:15] Ribbwich: @redut it also usually stems from them complaining about something minor when there are real problems in the game.

[1:27:17] quakegoogl: b1rds r fast

[2:22:48] Chrissfrosty: good mornign hammers up! towHorde towGift towGift towGift
[2:22:58] Lokajin: horde actually didnt start losing AV consistently till P6
[2:23:37] aazzox: do u gain honor fast from alterac valley?
[2:23:50] Lokajin: nobody knows probably cause most the pvper guys who raid naxx havent been pvping
[2:23:52] andTHISiswhat: Its cuz of same reason in Retail... Players stopped, their waiting for BC they got their rank they want and gear they want
[2:23:54] Masqerader: its always 50/50 u might win u might lose /the end
[2:24:04] Lincoln_WoW: horde did win AV a ton in the original version because their starting cave was closer to the middle than alliance
[2:24:08] Numaiirr: Power to the horde
[2:24:16] Lincoln_WoW: but they normalized it eventually
[2:24:17] SSD511_: Lol true it’s happened to me all the time I lose in each side I’m a curse LUL
[2:24:22] andTHISiswhat: Yea

[2:25:06] manmower: in original vanilla the alliance base had a big advantage on the horde layout, so it was pretty rough originally
[2:25:09] Mecabeast: when I played horde only turtles if we could pin alliance in a gy and farm them
[2:25:13] CritcobainTV: 2-3 if we make it quick lol
[2:25:15] SonofHorus82: yeah also Azuresong has way more Alliance than Horde so there are more and better PVPers than Horde zergs.
[2:25:43] Lokajin: that doesnt matter horus since bg's are cross realm
[2:25:54] andTHISiswhat: @Towelliee Can u help get me KSM xD

[2:29:35] Ambersulfr: Right? You can't carry someone who has to manage all the prideful timing himself.
[2:29:37] Kinghorn: what borean tundra thing, I just woke up
[2:29:50] DudeInARobe: Group of friends and I just carry each other’s alts through keys, take turns doing it. It’s a win win cause I get more vault gear on my main and my alt gets geared between that

[2:49:23] Rastailian: Ion: we understood stygia was mis-named. it is actually stingya
[2:49:44] remitis: do you vape for the nicotine from smoking in the past?
[2:49:46] Layercake: Being sting is part of Blizzard plan to keep people playing...but this time it totally backfired
[2:49:46] Darthyrevan: I can see 9.3 happening but itll be a small zone and 2/3 boss raid

[2:51:29] ravenoushydra: you're right the barrens
[2:51:38] Kinghorn: oh shit I forgot about the barrens stuff
[2:51:39] Thunder4o: MoP had .4 but one of the .X patches was selfy cam,stop been nostalgic and think the game was that great before,on top of that SoO was 14 months raid
[2:51:39] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™

[2:53:13] MistaHat: 9.1 may be out in Augst
[2:53:24] Lincoln_WoW: last week's build was just bad. memory leaks everywhere
[2:53:26] mitchumtx: someone i was talking to is SET on 9.1 in June

[2:54:16] MistaHat: @dracullus im not sure how this is a joke to you. Saying july or augst is a reasonable thought
[2:54:17] Korupcija_: hahahah
[2:54:18] Lincoln_WoW: Ion barely plays WoW. I don't think he can play those other games.
[2:54:22] Thunder4o: @TheRiwen not even close,SL is alot better than WoD
[2:54:28] xsp00n: k ty
[2:54:29] Kromede: IonJam
[2:54:32] alb1nn0: what time is the interview?
[2:54:39] Lincoln_WoW: !interview
[2:54:40] Moobot: @Lincoln_WoW WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 3h 16m 10s
[2:54:42] Aaradin: he plays wow enough to nerf mythic when his guild gets to bosses they cant kill
[2:54:48] ChikiiW: havnt tuned in for a few months, have you moved?
[2:54:54] ravenoushydra: please be june for tbc pleeeeeease
[2:54:58] MistaHat: thank you lol
[2:54:59] MrEvilRex: !room
[2:54:59] Moobot: @MrEvilRex Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:55:02] Kinghorn: he is 9/10 lincoln, still better than my guild LUL
[2:55:05] ManiacalCarl: Every other comment..."did you move?"
[2:55:07] mavericks312: a double June release would cuck themselves
[2:55:15] constantinfive: may is prepatch and yes june
[2:55:20] dracullus: of course it will be June, maybe raid will release July
[2:55:22] TheRiwen: @Thunder4o I like wod more sry to say so
[2:55:23] CritcobainTV: ITS GONNA BE MAY
[2:55:24] CritcobainTV: Kappa
[2:55:24] Frosty1u1: i am ready for more oondasta farming
[2:55:24] Aravarth: I imagine June because that's when all the kids get out of school for summer holiday
[2:55:28] wraaith: how long will prepatch be ?
[2:55:29] ravenoushydra: I can't take doing vanilla raids much more
[2:55:38] Hestert: so blizzcoline will be 9.2 news
[2:55:58] kibil_burk: what about the end of season 1?
[2:56:05] LeonardLongNips: still think even with 9.1 launch tbc classic numbers will still be huge
[2:56:16] LeonardLongNips: idk anyone that cares about 9.1 more than tbc

[2:56:33] mavericks312: the big classic numbers will be wrath
[2:56:38] PharoGames: I would totally ask ion about all the recent departures from blizzard and what that means and the perception behind it.
[2:56:45] wraaith: tbc is basicly the illidan card they played for legion we love that guy aparently
[2:56:46] sweckz: i hope you bring the heat on him about SL being so slow content wise. its really unacceptable, almost like they didn't have a plan. also his answer on solo q pvp was a joke, if it helps players stay in the game and if its what the majority want just let us try it for a season.
[2:56:50] ravenoushydra: it's better this way imo
[2:56:51] Masqerader: It will have its 1-2 weeks hype then nose dive
[2:56:56] Zander_TheGamer: Wrath will probably be the biggest hype. That would be my guess.
[2:57:00] LordKain73: WotLK > TBC
[2:57:16] ravenoushydra: classic launch brought a torrent of people who clearly did not have any interest but were there just for the hype
[2:57:22] dracullus: hype will be bigger than retail patch, but smaller than Vanilla Classic or retail expac launch I guess
[2:57:22] bypized: Idk man, maybe people are also just tired of Blizzard
[2:57:27] mavericks312: wrath will blow tbc numbers away
[2:57:30] Radiag: i think tbc beta would've had 1m views if it was before classic as well, now everyones got the earlier stuff they asked for, so much less excitement
[2:57:52] plushack: !interview
[2:57:52] Moobot: @plushack WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 3h 12m 57s
[2:58:01] smashinu187: do you think we will have another big patch after 9.1 or do you feel like it will finish like wod and this will be our last big update until next expansion since they know TBC can carry?!?!
[2:58:04] LeonardLongNips: 9.1 is gonna be a snooze
[2:58:06] NovaSun84: Just letting the streamer elites get father ahead in TBC arena experience before the plebs can play it legit
[2:58:13] duffluv22: i used to love the environmental changes!!!
[2:58:21] TheRiwen: 9.1 will come to late to get people back
[2:58:36] mwchaos: RWF is easily the biggest thing retail has going for it in terms of entertainment and hype value

[2:58:56] TheNextKing306: wow 2.0 announced today on preach stream, you heard it her first folks.
[2:58:59] Jm3llow: METHOD PLAID vs METHOD TURQUOISE
[2:59:06] LeonardLongNips: Do people actually care about world first? SL world 1st was boring and the cast was kind of a snooze
[2:59:15] XarkoLP: Limit vs Echo vs Shade
[2:59:25] mavericks312: isn't limit going for the 3 peat?
[2:59:30] manmower: hard to find people who can take that much time off of their jobs
[2:59:36] Yagr6: isnt gold sink a big part of their advantage

[2:59:57] sweckz: do they have the backing behind them for boes?
[2:59:58] Lincoln_WoW: i don't think FSY raids enough hours to get first tho
[3:00:10] ravenoushydra: I really don't care I just want to see the twitter drama after whoever wins LUL
[3:00:10] tyrel_jones: Ngl this edging the rest of those guilds do is extraordinary
[3:00:22] dalaraz: fsy have that sweet underdog role,everybody likes t hem
[3:00:26] tyrel_jones: They will break thru one day
[3:00:26] MistaHat: Did they even get CE?
[3:00:34] Masqerader: He's gonna need a lot of saronite bombs to get top 15 now
[3:00:36] facerolljack: Kungen was world #1 Warrior in Pugs KEKW
[3:00:44] mwchaos: all they'd really need is a community behind them, FSY is actually insane
[3:00:48] Telmorra: Isnt there a massive spike in requirements between first and fourth?
[3:01:03] smashinu187: the world first race isnt even fun anymore.. limit will win.. there just isnt enough money for these other teams to compete.
[3:01:05] sifer007: kungen FailFish
[3:01:05] Lincoln_WoW: their pull counts are amazing tho. they kill bosses in so many less pulls for their raid hours
[3:01:12] tyrel_jones: When FSY gets WF will be the best day in WoW WF history
[3:01:16] SamDavidsin: howd u like mk?

[3:02:07] mwchaos: they got a bunch of gamers in there
[3:02:29] Zander_TheGamer: I am kinda routing for Big Dumb Guild now that Sloot is on the roster. For at least 3rd place.
[3:02:45] Mecabeast: the skill in fsy is scary when you compare playtime during the race
[3:02:51] nielefs: How long do you think blizzard keeps making expansions ?
[3:02:54] Cwchong: wait, wat happened to method?
[3:03:08] Chrissfrosty: also all the good player  flock to them
[3:03:09] Masqerader: ya pieces/FSY were like a day apart
[3:03:21] Aravarth: Funny story, Christian Bishop (one of the execs at Method) was my high school student when I taught at Florida Air Academy in Melbourne, FL
[3:03:37] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee So, i think i figured the issue out. I was using the 20% zanza speed pot before the patch, but after patch i've been going too fast and the mobs pathing is wrong. so if i stop using speed pot i should be fine
[3:04:02] Korupcija_: limit will always win unless echo moves to NA
[3:04:04] facerolljack: I think BDGG is good enough to be 3rd but first and 2nd are locked in currently
[3:04:06] Lincoln_WoW: BDGG rebuilt their roster this tier too.
[3:04:10] Zander_TheGamer: It is true though
[3:04:24] CADZtv: lol sloot being their isnt going to make them jump 7 places
[3:04:25] CADZtv: KEKW

[3:06:06] Moobot: @Crystalfade WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 3h 4m 44s
[3:06:16] RocketMan23: his point was that as a tank you dont have a way to push yourself
[3:06:18] Mecabeast: something about motivation as a tank during farm is much harder than a dps
[3:06:33] RocketMan23: he also made that point about healers as well
[3:06:35] mwchaos: dps turned tanks put more of an emphasis on dps not just survivability is another aspect of the role too.
[3:07:09] BoogieDuck: Did i miss the big announcement?
[3:07:13] Aravarth: Heh, I can prot and holy, and ret just confounds me
[3:07:16] DatacronGuide: Good Morning to ALL!
[3:07:23] manmower: dps is the toughest raid role
[3:08:03] sweckz: even thd ? Kappa
[3:08:17] Ambersulfr: Hardest classes to do that are the ones that can do melee/ranged and tank or heal.
[3:08:25] CritcobainTV: I could do it Kappa
[3:08:27] manmower: maybe his succubus
[3:08:33] B4RRE: the whole roster could probably tank one race
[3:08:33] RocketMan23: i think tanking high keys is the best way to push yourself as a tank
[3:08:37] Ambersulfr: I could figure it out resto/ele but I'd have a damn hard time also doing enh

[3:10:05] hgizaira: most of them have all classess above 225
[3:10:07] club420: some limit players only play one spec, but thats because that spec is required for a raid buff or utility, and usually only need 1 of that spec
[3:10:12] sweckz: trill 100% could play survival
[3:10:14] Blvdman: KEKW i knew it lol

[3:11:04] facerolljack: I'm just hoping that Havoc is strong enough so its worth bringing over Vengance so I can see Fragnance and Avade playing Havoc
[3:11:07] Blvdman: ehh frag doesnt play sham

[3:11:40] club420: preach should really ask when 3rd dh spec is comming
[3:11:49] quakegoogl: ruyuQUEZAPOGGL PopCorn
[3:11:59] RacerDuke: How is 9.1 coming along on the PTR, is it done yet? lol
[3:12:01] Lincoln_WoW: they tested with double bear tho
[3:12:02] manmower: so 3-4 warriors in the raid?
[3:12:04] Ciyouthere: Most Veng players have 0 clue what to do to survive as one
[3:12:12] B4RRE: double prot warr or warrior bear

[3:12:26] Masqerader: @Infrnowaffle that is pretty dumb statement
[3:12:27] sweckz: if they dont run a WW or MW they will need a monk for the buff
[3:12:28] dalaraz: unless they nerf banner,double warrior it is
[3:12:28] kimmo_gaming: Its a trap
[3:12:29] Thdlock: tested with double bear when darke was playing poe so sang had to tank LUL
[3:12:33] facerolljack: @Thdlock yeah but you used them in Nathria for the debuff because havoc wasn't worth for you guys and I really wanna see Avade :D
[3:12:34] Ballsonfire_: Bear is so fun sadge
[3:12:35] Holysal: im playing bear
[3:12:39] Lincoln_WoW: i think bear / warrior is better than double warrior

[3:13:08] Ciyouthere: @Masqerader How? Most players fall down.
[3:13:11] Holysal: not if you balance aff
[3:13:12] manmower: yea but the travel form could carry the warrior back to the boss faster

[3:42:09] quakegoogl: catJAM
[3:42:15] Blistz1: i don't mind that it takes a process in switching covenants
[3:42:16] Ka5h3d: $20 says there's no soul ash or stygia catch-up and no removal of conduit energy
[3:42:18] smokingcactus: as a filthy casual i thought switching to new covenant was pretty easy and even easier to switch back to original
[3:42:19] xdunpealx: Ion is gonna talk about, results of Torg, flying, how the raid is, how many people saw the raid to make it seem great
[3:42:30] ravenoushydra: they already agreed on the topics
[3:42:32] jaysteea: social security number?
[3:42:34] Lexi__Marie: do you think we get a release date for 9.1 this week?
[3:42:36] Holy_Z: Ask why world content is so mind numbingly dull
[3:42:38] DrakeDuude: i want to know about BOE's

[3:42:42] Rivix86: Think they will go more in depth on kaplin?
[3:42:44] Masqerader: ask about ipas
[3:42:45] fistofnature: in the last interview they asked if they had plans on making m+ solo queue and all i can think of is the toxicity that comes out of it LUL
[3:42:48] gajoxi: @Towelliee Imo Islands looks much better than torghast, it was a varriety atlesat, now all look the same tho still hyped for 9.1 raid
[3:42:48] xdunpealx: i wonder if Ion ever explodes on his team
[3:42:51] Medobolt: i havent swapped covenants yet im good KEKW

[3:43:24] ItsXolten: @Ka5h3d I agree I hate running torghast boring and no rewarding
[3:43:34] Ka5h3d: There's a reason everyone calls it choreghast
[3:43:35] Medobolt: i think the raid looks amazing
[3:43:35] xdunpealx: anima grinding is fun for you
[3:43:38] Blvdman: bland?
[3:43:40] DudeInARobe: If I didn’t lose my renown when I switched covenants I’d be a much happier person. Especially with all the nerfs and buffs coming 😡

[3:44:06] MistaHat: CHARLIE MURPHY
[3:44:08] DreamWebb: no new armor set either PepeHands
[3:44:09] xdunpealx: lets be honest the new mounts coming though.. some hype
[3:44:09] AureliusXV: well duh what were you expecting
[3:44:13] brain_wash: I got to floor 18 ,layer 3 in TC, and got pwnd by the boss.  Just kick me in the nuts Blizz
[3:44:15] Marah57: blizzard is so horny for torghast
[3:44:18] Medobolt: @DudeInARobe you keep your renown when you join back
[3:44:18] Squirrel_nutty: fuck yo couch!
[3:44:27] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee You wanna know how excited I am for this PC? I Literally had a dream that you showed up in a fucking Helicopter to drop the PC off to me KEKW
[3:44:28] ChiefMango: Imagine if torghast had some "cow lvl" shit like diablo where you can get floors which are like flashbacks or scenery for other zones like the jailer is trying to fuck with your mindd or something. could be cool
[3:44:29] Ka5h3d: I think some of the boss models are unique
[3:44:29] MIKEBRASKA: what did the five fingers say to the face? SLAAAAAAAAAP
[3:44:40] BruceRain: probably a new wing with 38989234 floors too
[3:44:42] Ka5h3d: Tarragrue definitely isn't unique and neither is probably 90% of the trash
[3:44:43] GTrakl: @DudeInARobe You don't lose your renown
[3:44:47] luckfore: the dungeon is completely new
[3:44:52] Jay_rb: It looks like Torghast LUL

[3:44:58] xdunpealx: last time i was impressed was with Garrosh
[3:45:00] rockthefries: its 4x4 farm LOL
[3:45:06] dSaipher: I said it back before launch: Torghast will be a bigger let down than Islands. And here we are
[3:45:12] DudeInARobe: @gtrakl If you go from one covenant to the other, you do indeed lose your renown
[3:45:13] toobaked1987: @Towelliee do you think we will learn anything new from today's interview?
[3:45:17] Dagomarus: It looks good if you like the look of torghast i guess
[3:45:20] ItsXolten: They got the assets for torghast for 50% spring sale on the asset store what do you expect them not to use em LUL
[3:45:22] RageerPLZ: look at that wall, look at ground and look at the sky shit it's good to be in this raid.

[3:45:36] mwchaos: preach is @c_reddddd
[3:45:38] xdunpealx: announce Blizzcon this year thats what I truly want
[3:45:39] wise_JESTER: Servers are live?
[3:45:41] GTrakl: @DudeInARobe No, you never earned renown with covenant. You're not losing anything. If you go back, your renown will be there.
[3:45:47] silitung: Is Lore the guy who used to do the daily marmot?
[3:45:52] ravenoushydra: I think preach will start by apologising for #pulltheripcord LUL
[3:45:58] toobaked1987: Are we watching the interview on this channel?

[3:46:17] Glozki: I'm just happy we're getting some communication finally
[3:46:24] xdunpealx: Lore aka Josh would do Tank Spot and do raid guides he was like the Godfather of it
[3:46:31] DudeInARobe: @gtrakl What??? Lol yeah, if you go BACK to your existing covenant you get your renown back. If you go to a new Covenant, you completely go down to 0/40 renown
[3:46:34] DehCantao: they wont be
[3:46:40] Marah57: Preach will deliver
[3:46:43] Domini1001: @ItsXolten  oh nice thanks
[3:46:44] silitung: Yeah. I used to live by him. Seen him a few times at the mall
[3:46:49] MagicMalTv: is this eu?

[3:47:09] derElten: classic andies

[3:47:45] Domini1001: @Towelliee  i got SL beta first wave as mythic raider and i have naxx cleared i have no clue why tbc beta was not given to me im really confused
[3:47:46] MIKEBRASKA: holes are legit though
[3:47:47] MistaHat: is the reach around still a requirement?

[3:47:58] CritcobainTV: joking btw chat
[3:48:06] DudeInARobe: @gtrakl That’s my initial point though. I said if I can move between covenants freely without going to 0/40 renown, I’d be a much happier person. I’m NF right now for my Hunter. If Venthyr is BIS in 9.1, that is where the issue lies (hypothetically speaking)
[3:48:16] 91Niki: @critcobain Are you tho 🤔
[3:48:19] Shrenko: I actually dont want TBC beta, want to wait for release, nothing really to test
[3:48:25] CritcobainTV: @91Niki nob ut i need them to think i am

[3:48:49] xdunpealx: am i the only one who doesnt really do beta anymore? I want to be surprised now and go through the game---not know everything before
[3:48:55] smokingcactus: @DudeInARobe do what everyone else does level each cov to 40 and then wait to see what is best in 9.1 and go to that one
[3:48:56] MistaHat: @DudeInARobe im not defending the swapping AT ALL. but is this your frist time swapping? if so then it shouldnt be a big deal to just change for the first time, right?
[3:49:16] CritcobainTV: @91Niki Shhh just look at my pupper and goats and forget this convo happened

[3:50:24] Kinghorn: SHARKSHOES
[3:50:30] Vanhoek: @DudeInARobe The reason you start at 0 is cause the renown is tied to the questline of that specific cov and they are all unique.
[3:50:37] DudeInARobe: @smokingcactus @mistahat I mean, like everyone else I’ll just switch to the META. I don’t want to go and do every single covenant campaign while one is the current BIS when I’m doing current raiding Prog/Mythic+. It only becomes a big deal when they nerf/buff covenants so much, especially when u need to get to Renown 80. Hoping for some clarification on that
[3:50:37] Medobolt: figure it out? people killed this stuff KEKW
[3:50:43] Unciatim: I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a system that lets you join a covenant that has already been unlocked by another character... so say you have 4 toons with each cov, you can freely switch, with little penalties.. ie just some questlines and keeping anima/renown...
[3:51:05] Nefand: so not so great after all 🤣
[3:51:06] AureliusXV: come the hell onl lol its special? lol thius shit is goign to be a bust lol
[3:51:06] dSaipher: How many peoplle are going to get burnt out BC questing and never make it to 70
[3:51:07] Ka5h3d: @vanhoek After hitting 40 renown though it should be fine to switch between covenants and not have to re-grind renown in order to unlock the storyline I feel
[3:51:10] DudeInARobe: @vanhoek Yeah, I fully understand that. They need to assume however, that I have alts that have done those campaigns before. Resetting to 0/40 cause it’s now BIS for me is just frustrating
[3:51:13] CritcobainTV: just give them all away at once and get it over with KEKW
[3:51:21] sapmyballs: any chance we could get your beta addon profile when TBC goes live?
[3:51:27] plumpus81: 12 people
[3:51:28] daddy_dolby: Are you on live? All my servers are down
[3:51:31] jeneraljelly: TBC leveling 60-70 is super quick
[3:51:34] MistaHat: @DudeInARobe hopefully, as a fellow hunter, we only have one covenant throughout. but i feel you though, all that work to have to swap sounds awwwwwwwwwwwwful
[3:51:39] plumpus81: @daddy_dolby , EU servers
[3:51:39] floopsi_tv: !room
[3:51:39] Moobot: @floopsi_tv Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:51:41] xdunpealx: the burn out, will come when you grind for SpellStrike and Battlehood sets :D
[3:51:43] jerexify: @daddy_dolby He's on EU.
[3:51:48] daddy_dolby: Ah okay
[3:51:50] daddy_dolby: Ty
[3:51:52] jberry: I thought the servers were down?
[3:51:54] Zander_TheGamer: I am already burnt out on BC lol
[3:51:55] dSaipher: Hellfire PVP is gonna be a shit show lol
[3:51:58] Ka5h3d: Especially since the initial covenant storylines will be outdated in 9.1, they should just disconnect them from renown grinding in general
[3:51:59] jerexify: @jberry EU.
[3:52:11] Glozki: @Towelliee hows the room construction going
[3:52:15] Masqerader: towelliee needs to make an eu command for reset day LOL
[3:52:16] DudeInARobe: @mistahat Yeah exactly. I hope they assume we’ve done those covenant campaigns in the past, and we can just start at 40/80 if we need to switch for the meta
[3:52:20] Medobolt: you press it once @Towelliee
[3:52:26] LeonardLongNips: Do people actually care about 9.1 at this point? lol
[3:52:32] MIKEBRASKA: people that didnt burn out in classic questing definitely wont in TBC questing, or leveling in general
[3:52:49] Nico_vdM: I dont spam these, I just press something when asked.  Seems to work fine for me
[3:52:51] pobu_: !room
[3:52:51] Moobot: @pobu_ Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:52:51] Lexi__Marie: yes @LeonardLongNips i have no interest in bc tho
[3:52:55] Glozki: figured youd floor first no?
[3:52:55] danksportscards: full hour reset....poop on that
[3:52:59] jerexify: @MIKEBRASKA I just hit 50 in Classic last night. I want so bad to stop, but I'm so close now...
[3:53:11] Roobi_doobi: roobi_doobi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 6 month streak! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:53:13] excessior: @LeonardLongNips yeah raids usually bring ppl back
[3:53:16] Glozki: thats dope
[3:53:24] Unciatim: Make sure they get that flooring tight.. or the squeeking creaking will drive you nuts...
[3:53:31] Aidler: let's hope they know what they are doing towLul
[3:53:39] DreamWebb: after the WF race to 70 whos gonna watch BC maybe Arena?
[3:53:41] DecayedmiNt: Depending on the flooring, they likely want to finish the walls first to avoid damaging the floor/having to cover it.
[3:53:45] oSpaced: Yeah don’t wanna mess up the new floor before cabinets are made
[3:53:46] SlipKnoT_: @Towelliee  probally doing shelving first  just in case somthing was to  fall or dammage the flooring :)
[3:53:48] lumaday: A new raid sounds so good right now
[3:53:51] Nico_vdM: @jerexify during beta the leveling from 40-60 will be easier.  You can probably wait till then
[3:54:01] smokingcactus: I dont want to kill my queen tho!
[3:54:02] Mickeyfats: gimmick
[3:54:05] MIKEBRASKA: @jerexify tbh you picked a rough time to start leveling, in TBC the XP requirements between 20-60 are lowered, so you are slogging through the longest part to jump right into another slog haha
[3:54:06] ChocoDecay: I want Sylvanas to die but idk if she will.
[3:54:08] Moobot: @redut WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 2h 16m 41s

[3:54:09] Takinshotz: @towelliee what mini map addon are you using?
[3:54:11] DudeInARobe: Do we know what % of the player base has gotten CE?
[3:54:11] toobaked1987: @Towelliee if they dont make it that kind of fight, people are going to be super let down
[3:54:12] excessior: jaina ?
[3:54:13] ravenoushydra: she's my queen tho
[3:54:15] ravenoushydra: I would never hurt her
[3:54:16] Hybridwarhawk: No shot she dies in the raid
[3:54:17] FistoTheFistybot: Hope she's gone for good afterwards LUL
[3:54:19] organicmolecules: it's elvui
[3:54:19] HeyDeMuu: but we can't kill our queen Kreygasm
[3:54:26] Ertra: !interview
[3:54:27] Shrenko: @Takinshotz its just elvui
[3:54:30] LeonardLongNips: idk I could careless about sylvannas. She has sucked for like 3 expacs
[3:54:37] xdunpealx: molding?
[3:54:47] jeneraljelly: @LeonardLongNips same tbh.. idk why i just dgaf lol
[3:54:50] jerexify: @MIKEBRASKA Well that's encouraging... lol
[3:54:57] KnsWoW: isnt it called the base
[3:55:03] MIKEBRASKA: @jerexify that said, you can dungeon grind from 60-70 in a day if you want, I know thats my plan
[3:55:04] Glozki: i miss voljin died from plot feelsbad
[3:55:06] jerexify: @Nico_vdM I was hoping to be done by then, but not sure if I will be.
[3:55:12] Takinshotz: Ty
[3:55:13] kashmara: just a shadow I think
[3:55:15] theoriginalzinng: there are far more sylvanas simps than sylvanas haters but yeah im in the whatever camp
[3:55:20] nightmayor12: POG
[3:55:21] SlipKnoT_: oh dang thats so nice towel
[3:55:21] nachobears: !interview
[3:55:21] Moobot: @nachobears WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 2h 15m 28s
[3:55:26] Glozki: those look solid
[3:55:28] sussyrev: looks kinda sus
[3:55:33] jerexify: @MIKEBRASKA Yeah, I'm leveling a Paladin, so that should make it at least a little easier.
[3:55:34] SlipKnoT_: almost like its own floor
[3:55:36] prayforab: its a shadow
[3:55:38] Nico_vdM: Could just be shadow
[3:55:42] Hupu_a: just a rendering of the floor
[3:55:43] ValarinX: arnt servers down right now??
[3:55:43] Windydish: just a shadow from the rendering @Towelliee
[3:55:43] Mecabeast: maybe something for anti dust or bugs?
[3:55:45] slacky17: toe space
[3:55:53] dSaipher: it's the cabinet base
[3:55:55] Glozki: the flooring may be layered over that lip at the bottom
[3:55:57] xdunpealx: yeah just a base
[3:55:59] Murlock07: wow man that's sick
[3:56:00] Wholoveswaffles: Kicker plates
[3:56:05] Aidler: I'm looking forward to "spit" on Sylvanas corpse after the fight towWar
[3:56:14] MIKEBRASKA: @jerexify hopefully prepatch lasts long enough to give you a bit of a break, I'll be mashing a BELF pally up to 60 on prepatch launch and then tanking dungeons from 60-70
[3:56:19] Hybridwarhawk: That looks amazing
[3:56:27] dSaipher: I mean i gurantee 90% of people's kitchen cabinets are the same
[3:56:27] gwar234: Wheres your list of fav bourbons? i could go for some suggestions
[3:56:29] Cluxxxx: What’s your favorite bourbon??

[3:56:52] Mecabeast: your gfuel collection?
[3:56:54] Glozki: how deep are they
[3:56:56] jerexify: @MIKEBRASKA Yeah, I'm hoping so. I was originally planning on using the boost on a Horde character, too, but after how long and tiring this leveling is, I'm not sure I want to try and do two characters in TBC.
[3:57:03] puffytaco151: a wet-bar has a sink with running water. A dry bar only has a place where you can prepare drinks and no sink
[3:57:08] Nico_vdM: Towellie if you look at the top, its probably just a cross section of ceiling and floor
[3:57:09] Zander_TheGamer: Do you have power to them?
[3:57:09] krytsi: i got similar shelving for my tarantulas. being just short of 6' makes them a bitch to clean LUL
[3:57:12] BruceRain: super cool man, excited for you!
[3:57:19] Cluxxxx: What’s your favorite bourbon??
[3:57:26] Marah57: How long until the room is done?
[3:57:29] xdunpealx: it would be kinda cool if your spaces could also pull out drawer
[3:57:29] SlipKnoT_: yea  dang thats gonna look slick for sure  cant wait to see it all complete
[3:57:38] Mr_cools292: @Towelliee Sup man how are you? Good morning.
[3:57:38] Unciatim: Doing surround sound? hehe
[3:57:41] pigzip: @towelliee what color is the floor going to be ?
[3:57:42] Murlock07: Every Man.. Man Cave dreams...
[3:57:47] MIKEBRASKA: @jerexify TBC leveling is fairly quick in comparison, even at a casual level, no boosts for draenei or belf toons so I gotta make the grind
[3:58:04] Mecabeast: is it gonna be syncable with your computer?
[3:58:09] jerexify: @MIKEBRASKA Yeah, I know @Towelliee is planning on doing the same.
[3:58:13] SlipKnoT_: towel rave stream lol
[3:58:15] Ryenonn: Where in the room are you putting these shelfs?
[3:58:18] oSpaced: That’s gonna look great can’t wait to see it!

[3:58:41] Enigmio: when is it done? should be done? :D
[3:58:45] MIKEBRASKA: so if anyone is fairbanks horde and wants to grind levels in prepatch and into TBC, hit me up lol
[3:58:59] SlipKnoT_: also it will help dampen the sound  i would think

[4:31:12] Thoreya: 90% of wow players are under 1800

[4:32:04] MikeyA1256: blizzard seems to categorize wow into 2 parts (PvP and PvE). instead of 3 (M+, raid, PvP)
[4:32:18] Yagr6: conqueror cant be better than heroic raid imo it should be 213 and ksm 226

[4:33:07] ZealotryTV: yeah but that is grody. what im saying is if you are 1400 you get max 207 ivl in pvp regardless of what your ilvl is and 213 for 1600 etc
[4:33:08] jcouls: i think rank 1 pvp gear should be as good as mythic raiding gear

[4:53:59] Lulaboo: @210Crawler Hi
[4:54:07] DoobieLee: and aura mastery on top of devo is nutty
[4:54:07] MikeyA1256: what leggo have you been using on monk?
[4:54:09] Frosttyy13: Mark of the wild yo BRING it back :D
[4:54:10] BRUTALIT0PS: Good morning y'all!

[4:54:28] Lulaboo: Good morning
[4:54:28] Lincoln_WoW: charred passions for dps
[4:54:29] Roobi_doobi: on monk
[4:54:32] MikeyA1256: same lol. some like charred passion but ive havent tried it
[4:54:47] dsj0: Hope he ask him again about releasing raid world wide at the same time
[4:54:49] barkiethebear: @FranciscoTHEmage most likely end of expansion like legion
[4:54:49] BRUTALIT0PS: How are you doing today Lula?
[4:54:49] pavepawns: i would love if they let us have 1 normal leg and 1 covenant leg on
[4:54:53] MikeyA1256: the energy use of double keg can be weird to manage sometimes
[4:54:59] Masqerader: the only other lego is lego my eggo
[4:55:06] Blvdman: @Towelliee I think the double legendary may end up being covenant legendary + any regular
[4:55:07] darkdestroz: Damn when u see graphics ingame starting to glitch out and mess up itz time for a new Gpu hehe
[4:55:32] bigcun88: What UI is this towelliee
[4:55:42] Medobolt: raider io saves your last logged out armory tho
[4:55:44] MikeyA1256: ive tried the defense one in some keys. not bad, 30% chance to not consume charge of purifying brew
[4:55:50] Medobolt: you gotta see the key
[4:56:13] pavepawns: i hope they do that cause i want fun
[4:56:28] PvtHudson093: It would make Ret stupid too
[4:56:28] BubbaChubbs420: just make pally OP in general LuL

[4:56:29] iblighters: 1 min Convokes
[4:56:33] Yagr6: that extra talent legendary was unique back in legion
[4:56:37] Zander_TheGamer: Yes, I wish the covenant legendries were able to be worn with your current one.
[4:56:43] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee so should i be saving up soul ash.
[4:56:51] Blvdman: Yea cuz some regular leggo combos would just straight up be broken
[4:56:51] DoctorWhiteFace: necro prot pally :(

[4:57:51] ravenoushydra: I really do hope you are right
[4:58:12] Medobolt: or you announce double lego POGGERS
[4:58:24] 210Crawler: Hoping for TBC release date
[4:58:31] brighadoon: How contentious will this interview be?
[4:58:59] RogueBear: strong possibility im going frost on my mage. ive still got my single target lego to max if im going to do that and i havent crafted any of the 3 that arcane uses. in a few months i dont even know what covenant ill be lol NotLikeThis
[4:59:01] Onearmyof2: woo torgahst
[4:59:03] 91Niki: LUL
[4:59:05] TombStoneMercenary: SL and Content now thats something I have not heard for a long time :(
[4:59:06] Enigmio: kothia is a joke
[4:59:07] Lulaboo: Tense, maybe a little fighty?
[4:59:11] abbotatoes: People gonna argue about it
[4:59:18] Sollice: Will preach make it a hard and uncomfortable iterview
[4:59:30] ravenoushydra: preach will challenge Ion to a boxing match I'm sure
[4:59:34] Medobolt: #subonly chat
[4:59:34] tdpark_: slootREE
[4:59:35] Medobolt: EZ
[4:59:40] Glozki: chat is guna be rutheless
[4:59:40] PadidinJones: Comon preach EMOTE ONLY
[4:59:46] kashmara: wanna go into the chat with like those lead things they wear to take xrays
[4:59:46] SonofHorus82: If Preach has any sense he'll close the chat room.
[4:59:51] 91Niki: @Towelliee contentious pretty much means heated, intense
[4:59:53] tdpark_: pgeChubZ
[4:59:55] FranciscoTheMage: but will ION be seeing the chat room??
[5:00:12] Zander_TheGamer: It is so easy to be aggressive hiding behind your computer in the safety of your home....unfortunately.
[5:00:15] Poriand: SL was so good at the start
[5:00:17] Glozki: low key feel for ion hes the target of a lot of rage if its a good or bad expac
[5:00:39] toobaked1987: @Towelliee are we watching on your stream?
[5:00:39] 210Crawler: ready for the show
[5:00:40] NovaSun84: Will Preach do that though?  My thoughts are no
[5:00:43] Sollice: @Gloskki He is the face of WoW. That's his job. Take the good with the bad. No need to feel bad for him
[5:00:44] CipherEx: What time is the interview?
[5:00:47] ElPolloBatman: ion's explanation: we see classic patches as a part of the shadowlands patch cycle Kappa
[5:00:51] Sollice: !interview
[5:00:51] Moobot: @Sollice WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 1h 9m 58s
[5:00:58] brighadoon: I’ll say it. I miss artifact power and TF. Gave me a reason to keep playing
[5:01:39] Glozki: @Sollice yea of course he knew when he took the job
[5:01:45] NovaSun84: I'd love if there was a question about him not clearing mythic content LUL
[5:01:49] Yagr6: ill never forget when ion said fuck demo locks basically in wod interview LUL
[5:01:55] RocketMan23: that superdata is worthless without comparison points from other expansions
[5:02:06] TombStoneMercenary: After 16+ years of almost constant subbing to wow this is the first time ive been out....
[5:02:07] 210Crawler: gesundheit
[5:02:19] NovaSun84: If the dude who can create the cheat codes can't beat the game... what chance we got?  Kappa

[5:02:57] RocketMan23: but we dont know
[5:02:58] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee so there's no way ION is showing up and will say point blank FU toxic players. We like what we've put out. We stand by it. We will release a new patch when its ready to go.  @Towelliee
[5:03:16] ArcaneSyntax: I think it's normal for the last 4 expansions.
[5:03:36] PadidinJones: I hate to say I was part of that 41%. Its not worth it for me as a casual to keep paying when content has not been update in a while
[5:03:38] RocketMan23: thats my point without numbers for the past few expansions those numbers dont mean anything
[5:03:41] dSaipher: *smashes button*: Blame it on the rona
[5:03:47] dracullus: first you would have to know official data to draw any conclusion, of course huge drop is normal, but devil is in details
[5:03:52] dsj0: Can't wait what they will Activision will answer to that on their earnings call next week.
[5:03:56] maccaruso: I don't know the content cycle of BfA vs SL but a -60% revenue decrease is all hands on deck material.
[5:03:56] Masqerader: it would be like if 41% of a countries population just disappeared, people would be concerned
[5:04:00] Anderus00: about 3 in 4 of my friends are saying. just sitting around not doing much waiting for new content and stuff to do. that doesnt sound like a game anyone wants to play
[5:04:02] Blvdman: thats insane
[5:04:03] Sollice: 41% is not normal, but you also have to understand they are IN THE BUSINESS of player retention. Losing that high of a % is not good at all
[5:04:06] sinlesssinner: !interview
[5:04:06] Moobot: @sinlesssinner WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 1h 6m 44s
[5:04:25] Sollice: SL SPECIFIC GOAL was retention now more so then EVER
[5:04:25] Aidler: 41 % is def not normal. that's some Thanos shit....
[5:04:27] PadidinJones: fuck the past here and now is what matters
[5:04:27] Elementlolz1: !room
[5:04:27] Moobot: @Elementlolz1 Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:04:28] onous_: The hype on Shadowlands was bigger then BFA.
[5:04:37] casualfury: it isnt
[5:04:39] ArcaneSyntax: If Shadowlands started higher than it would be better
[5:04:41] mitchumtx: WoW is also losing players to FFXIV IF WE BEING HONEST
[5:04:42] Enigmio: retention with m+ LUL
[5:04:43] RocketMan23: without more information, like what was the shadowlands peak vs bfa peak thats also important
[5:04:48] NovaSun84: wait we're saying BFA was the golden child in this argument?  KEKW
[5:04:50] byrdeen45: i liked bfa cant stand shadowlands
[5:04:50] Masqerader: Thanos got sick of SL and snapped his fingers and 41% of the population turned to ust
[5:04:56] pokerigo: KEKW
[5:04:58] Sollice: Again, peak does not matter
[5:04:58] Masqerader: dust
[5:05:02] Medobolt: nice one KEKW
[5:05:05] Anderus00: yeah i heard FF is picking up again. fr
[5:05:06] Layercake: LUL
[5:05:07] ravenoushydra: the game is straight bad
[5:05:10] Traumatize77: Bro, can't stand the amount of ads. Just got hit with another 7 ads...a bit much.
[5:05:11] magemaster225: valheim imo
[5:05:14] thiccsushi: ok now thats reaching
[5:05:16] mitchumtx: laugh all you want, you know its true
[5:05:16] Holysal: the google data says ff is searched more than wow
[5:05:17] wreckshoptv: whens the ION interview?
[5:05:18] Onearmyof2: but if there were 41% of 4 mill for bfa and then  41% of 7 mill... technically shadowlands is doing better
[5:05:21] RocketMan23: all im saying is i work with numbers for a living just having that one drop number doesnt mean anything without context
[5:05:27] Layercake: Wow is losing players to others games that are not MMOs
[5:05:28] Sollice: Their goal is retention, they want a higher % always playing. Box sales on a live service game is great...but they want to keep you paying that monthly
[5:05:30] Blvdman: I think wow is just boring overall nothing really to keep interest or look forward to. Nothing one can really grind out in 1 day feels like the important rewards are gated behind weekly
[5:05:45] ArcaneSyntax: Superdata can't even prove numbers
[5:05:49] NovaSun84: times ain't THAT desperate LUL'
[5:05:53] Masqerader: if we're being "honest" then goes full Pinocchio
[5:05:54] Shrenko: many did actually do go to FFXIV
[5:06:08] Anderus00: wow refugee LUL
[5:06:09] dkapocalypse: fuck that im not a weeb
[5:06:22] Hammeredpine27: Do we know what the torghast towers are this week?
[5:06:24] RocketMan23: that doesnt give you the whole picture though
[5:06:25] Anderus00: ok then where are those 41% going?
[5:06:30] Glozki: the big question is how do they fix it. no company can see that drop and not  address it as an issue
[5:06:31] mitchumtx: I know several guilds and other people in a community i am apart of go to FFXIV
[5:06:31] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:06:32] casualfury: imagine trying to defend them LUL
[5:06:33] tharieon: Do you like numbers taking over your screen like it did during legion? Go play FFXIV then!
[5:06:44] mitchumtx: it's not reaching to say WOW players are going to FFXIV
[5:06:47] ZeethianDragon: Shadowlands fucked up hard
[5:06:49] cineris_3: most of that hype died in beta
[5:06:53] Exodeo_: Doesn't Shadowlands have the downside that people are stuck at home and bored too though?
[5:06:53] tdpark_: FeelsBadMan
[5:06:57] Wildside1177: 41% may mean nothing. Without statistical analysis to determine if it was better or worse than other expansions the number is largely meaningless.
[5:06:59] FluffehZ: Well the subject Wow refugee playing XIV have started to trend rooThink
[5:07:01] byrdeen45: Only thing i found fun in shadowlands is the raids and it gets old after running it so much
[5:07:03] brighadoon: They removed The
[5:07:05] SonofHorus82: @Hammeredpine27 Soulforges and Upper Reaches.
[5:07:08] Onearmyof2: Yeah but this happens at the start of every expansion...
[5:07:09] torridcheese3: I think people were initially happy with just not playing BFA anymore but that didn't hold for long.
[5:07:11] ZeethianDragon: Shadowlands is just immensely grindy for no reason and lack of account bound stuff
[5:07:12] RocketMan23: its only bad if its below their expectations, if they expect that then its par for the course
[5:07:19] brighadoon: They removed the grind what did they think would happen?
[5:07:21] Hammeredpine27: Thank you @sonofhorus82
[5:07:21] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee Do you feel that it has more to do with the formula of wow or just the lack of SL being a real full fledged expansion at this point?
[5:07:31] PadidinJones: Being 60% down is basically WoW player base being the same as SWTOR
[5:07:36] NovaSun84: It's only millions of people logging off WoW Shadowlands, just relax my guy
[5:07:37] Blvdman: Is there a link for this statistic? First time in a while iv heard we had hard numbers
[5:07:37] ZeethianDragon: oof
[5:07:42] casualfury: yup
[5:07:50] Wildside1177: But I agree with you. I have not logged into SL to do anything other than raid for 5 weeks.
[5:07:51] P4RT1CLEM4N: Blizz spent too much money marketing SL to fool us than to actually make a xpac
[5:07:52] luke238: !interview
[5:07:52] Moobot: @luke238 WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 1h 2m 58s
[5:07:56] lmtheboogie: @Towelliee woah woah woah
[5:07:56] dracullus: I don't think it's even possible to retain people that come just for launch, most of that people I know isn't even interested in endgame, they just want hop to WoW for month and try new stuff @Towelliee
[5:07:56] rbayduden: he said it yo
[5:07:57] Masqerader: tornado destroys 41% of your house... it's not that bad lol
[5:07:58] Enigmio: as long as they dont change something with the core systems...nothing will change... they dont get retention with those systems
[5:07:58] Aidler: he is saying it
[5:08:00] abbotatoes: I've still got an unused collectors edition key...
[5:08:03] mitchumtx: Activision is ruining WoW
[5:08:04] PvtHudson093: i did prefer BFA and its grind to SL and its non grind
[5:08:13] maccaruso: If SL continues as is it will be WoD 2.0
[5:08:15] ZeethianDragon: you aint wrong
[5:08:15] magemaster225: shouldnt we be hearing if theyre gonna do blizzcon this year soon?
[5:08:21] Arakai: Literally the only thing that matters is player retention compared to previous expansions (not only BfA). People always quit between patches, retention for one patch in a vacuum does not say anything
[5:08:22] casualfury: @Masqerader LUL
[5:08:24] Shrenko: towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit towHesaidit
[5:08:33] facerolljack: we just stop at 9.2 and get something fresh and great like legion :)
[5:08:36] Kuroii_Ck: people didnt want an endless grind so blizzard abided and now people wwant the grind?
[5:08:36] ZeethianDragon: WoD had incredible raids and pvp
[5:08:37] dalaraz: @magemaster225 well they wont
[5:08:39] Kuroii_Ck: make up your minds imo
[5:08:41] brighadoon: We thought we didn’t want grinds but we did
[5:08:45] SilkeySmooth: bfa was good only eliteist hated it because if wf/tf
[5:08:49] Shrenko: corruption was 8.3 though right? Shadowlands 8.3 will probably keep us playing too @Towelliee
[5:08:51] RocketMan23: @Arakai exactly, its all relative to what history has proven for player retention
[5:08:54] Kael88: I used to think I hated visions but then Torghast happened FeelsBadMan
[5:08:59] Shrenko: 9.3 *
[5:09:02] Relyt97: I feel like thats the issue with taking away the "endless" grinds and then completely taking it away
[5:09:02] Aidler: Ion saying "If we lost Towelliee we lost the nation"....
[5:09:05] ZeethianDragon: Bfa had something to do. Shadowlands is just.. hmmm
[5:09:05] Zander_TheGamer: Yup, people bitched about the AP grind but it was a reason to log in and play everyday. Now there isn't one. That is way you shouldn't listen to people whining when developing WoW.
[5:09:06] casualfury: also zones were better
[5:09:07] lmtheboogie: @Towelliee as a super casual father of two. i don't raid or push m+ or pvp ladders. this exp only gives me the campaign. once that's done i stopped playing
[5:09:23] Layercake: Blizzard can't win...if they make too grindy ...people leave, If they remove the grind ...people leave HahaThink
[5:09:26] Blvdman: I'm pretty sure if torghast gave stygia player retention would be slightly higher
[5:09:26] ZeethianDragon: easily
[5:09:27] Wildside1177: Legion was amazing
[5:09:27] NovaSun84: D:
[5:09:32] Zander_TheGamer: 100% agree
[5:09:35] TombStoneMercenary: SL feels more like a patch than a expansion
[5:09:36] Medobolt: first patch of BFA? hard disagree
[5:09:39] euthelol: def miss BFA zones
[5:09:43] PoppaShot: If bfa had a vault it would of been king @towelliee
[5:09:46] NovaSun84: vampire larpers everywhere are stunned
[5:09:46] xXSiebzehnXx: Hot take: BFA in my top 5
[5:09:47] Cartharon: same
[5:09:52] Zander_TheGamer: I miss Azeroth
[5:09:53] zooyep: def is not from a pvp standpoint
[5:09:53] MrEvilRex: !interview
[5:09:53] Moobot: WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 1h 56s
[5:09:53] facerolljack: First Patch of BfA was quite dull though
[5:09:56] brian99000: Agreed. Been playing some classic instead lately, but damn straight I'm gonna come back to 9.1 for the story at minimum
[5:09:58] michaelmm: It feels surreal to say it but BfA 8.0/8.1 was more alt friendly than Shadowlands is in 9.0.
[5:09:59] SilkeySmooth: bfa I could heroic raid ilvl gear in pvp from vaping conquest that's better then what we got now for pvp
[5:10:01] Sollice: They need to loot anima costs on shit and do it now
[5:10:03] Kuroii_Ck: Blizz cant fucking win people dont want the grind and now they complain theres nothing to do
[5:10:04] 210Crawler: Personally, I have not logged on retail since February after I got the AOTC achievement and been leveling on and off on classic since
[5:10:05] KingofMeccano: lol the swtor patch is delayed with no eta
[5:10:08] Lincoln_WoW: are you comparing 8.0 BFA vs. 9.0? because 8.0 BFA was bad
[5:10:08] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:10:16] Kuroii_Ck: seriously pick something and stick with opinions
[5:10:19] Dratomae: Poor class design made bfa poop for me
[5:10:19] Sollice: Anima could be an ok grind but the cost of everything makes grinding completely stupid because it's not a grind worth doing
[5:10:23] raptorstrick: I really enjoyed BFA
[5:10:29] Miguel85NYC: I wish they would add new 5 man dungeons through out the expansions but they dont
[5:10:34] xXSiebzehnXx: @raptorstrick always had shit to do
[5:10:37] raptorstrick: Tons to do
[5:10:46] Onearmyof2: "Fixed"
[5:10:46] Zander_TheGamer: Hard agree
[5:10:49] Blvdman: If WoD had WQs and M+ it would be the best xpac. Proveth me wrong.
[5:10:52] lmtheboogie: is there even anything to grind for in shadowlands
[5:10:53] MrEvilRex: @Towelliee Hey do you use your treadmill? I was considering buying one but I fear that it will probably be a coat rack
[5:10:54] Kuroii_Ck: they didnt fix it in BoD it was still bad
[5:10:55] Sollice: They add dungeons on patches, just not every patcvh
[5:10:57] Lincoln_WoW: they fixed by making irrelevant tho.
[5:10:57] Sollice: patch*
[5:10:58] yokai_5: "fixing" azerite KEKW
[5:11:07] xXSiebzehnXx: @blvdman we can’t slootGamba

[5:13:29] Lincoln_WoW: its management and the random creativity that comes from sitting in the same office
[5:13:34] RocketMan23: if they couldnt figure out management by now, thats a failure on the managers part and they should be fired, its been over a year, they shouldhave figured it out by now
[5:13:39] magemaster225: 8.2
[5:13:42] Thunder4o: SL is alot better than BFA
[5:13:53] ZeethianDragon: oof
[5:13:54] Thunder4o: in every aspect

[5:14:03] thiccsushi: and 8.2 had a lot of content compared to whats shown in 9.1
[5:14:08] casualfury: why are you selling the expac if you are not sure about your ability to release patches
[5:14:09] Sollice: @Towelliee You may be right. Business do it ALL THE TIME. Sales stagnate, products, stagnate. Companies have to bring in new leadership to to bring back confidence in the product and start a new vision
[5:14:09] ZeethianDragon: @Thunder4o You're trolling
[5:14:12] Poriand: 8,2 was so good
[5:14:18] Kuroii_Ck: Shadowlands is better it just doesn't have the endless grind which is why the playerbase doesn't know what to do
[5:14:25] Thunder4o: @zeethiandragon no im not mate,thats my opinion
[5:14:26] ZealotryTV: @Thunder4o they are fighting for worst expansion ever so no lol
[5:14:29] ZeethianDragon: I loved 8.2
[5:14:31] PvtHudson093: 8.2 we Njatar and Mechagon

[5:15:29] Thunder4o: SL zones,story,first raid,M+,PvP,covenants compaired to azerite shit,all this is better than BFA
[5:15:53] tdpark_: remember the jumping jelly quest? slootREE
[5:15:57] Kainiee: no way lol
[5:15:59] Kinetikx1315: cool thanks
[5:16:03] Sollice: BfA zones werent bad. Zuldazar was a fucking mess though
[5:16:04] pereadin: Did they nerf storming btw?  Seems to be even more of a joke since the last nerf
[5:16:06] Kainiee: uldir was way better, on mythic that is
[5:16:09] Medobolt: pride > infested

[5:16:16] Enigmio: did someone say turtles?
[5:16:18] ZealotryTV: @Thunder4o yeah but a 10 month drought the first patch of an expansion is no acceptable
[5:16:18] tdpark_: infested EWWWW
[5:16:24] brighadoon: @thunder4o I agreee, content in SL is superior
[5:16:26] ZealotryTV: not*
[5:16:28] ArcaneSyntax: I think classes play a lot better in SL than BFA 100%
[5:16:34] synicx: isnt there a jumping jelly quest type in bastion
[5:16:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:16:35] facerolljack: M+ is not really much better than BfAs was Legion was just too good and unless they go back to that it will always be kinda meh
[5:16:43] xXSiebzehnXx: Jumping jellies before the fix oof
[5:16:55] raptorstrick: Preach is live
[5:16:58] cineris_3: was AoE capped in both lol
[5:17:01] Sollice: Yeah yeah WHY do we have AoE cap on some classes but not others?
[5:17:02] thiccsushi: aoe cap was one of the worst things they ever added
[5:17:04] MrGattz: im STILL upset about that stupid aoe cap
[5:17:10] Thunder4o: @ZealotryTV and still not even a 1000 guilds cleared mythic,so this is not much a drought
[5:17:12] ZeethianDragon: Aoe cap is fkn stupid
[5:17:15] Sollice: Do all mages have no AoE cap?
[5:17:17] dracullus: pointless to discuss, most raids are solid, usually it's all about your experience with guild etc
[5:17:19] BlueBlurPrime: Ony looks tired
[5:17:22] xXSiebzehnXx: @mrgattz I’m with ya slootRiot slootRiot slootRiot slootRiot slootRiot
[5:17:22] MrGattz: worst thing iv ever seen in a design decision
[5:17:27] ZealotryTV: @Thunder4o raiding isnt the only aspect of the game dude lol
[5:17:28] Unciatim: Yea.. he said he was going live about an hour prior to get set up and such.... @Towelliee
[5:17:30] BubbaChubbs420: he's chat is going to be Pepega
[5:17:31] Ezekyler: yeaah go live early, let chat warm up Kappa
[5:17:34] xrandomdoodx: the problem with SL M+ compared to legion M+ is that the dungeons in SL feel very lackluster comparatively imo
[5:17:41] facerolljack: AoE cap pretty much sucks
[5:17:42] Kainiee: i just feel council and generals arent tuned properly compared to all other bosses including sludgefist and sire, i dont feel uldir had that problem after fetid got fixed
[5:17:46] ElPolloBatman: ask ion the important stuff, is he a cat or a dog person
[5:17:56] Kuroii_Ck: Bonus roll being back is good
[5:18:12] Thunder4o: @ZealotryTV M+ and PvP is better so drought isnt that big of a deal
[5:18:14] Kalidin79: He said he was sending 'topics', not questions tho. Did that change?
[5:18:17] critin87: show time

[5:18:45] Medobolt: @Towelliee imagine SL with the old loot system POGGERS
[5:19:05] Sollice: Ask Ion where they got the data they made the decision on why bonus rolls were removed. Where was the outcry to have it removed

[5:19:43] DeanoTV: trueeee
[5:19:45] Kuroii_Ck: yes they did
[5:19:47] CardinalTX: they thought less loot = more challenge
[5:19:49] Sollice: I know exactly why it was removed....TO KEEP YOU PLAYING LONGER....Again it's that player retention shit that compltely back fired on them

[5:19:58] cineris_3: should have kept WF/TF too
[5:20:02] NovaSun84: no-one reasonable is clamoring for less loot in a video gaame
[5:20:08] 91Niki: @MrGattz "BALANCE THE GAME" and blizzard said "Okay" FeelsBadMan
[5:20:08] toobaked1987: No one is WoW wants less loot. This game is all about the purples

[5:20:22] casualfury: LUL
[5:20:28] Colt_Engineer: @Ezekyler lol
[5:20:32] Chiphazzord: the should have either dropped less OR lower ilvl but not both
[5:20:32] tdpark_: YEP
[5:20:33] Arakai: The complaints were everywhere, we asked for this
[5:20:37] brighadoon: I remember asmongold said they should drop less loot and ppl agreed
[5:20:38] xXSiebzehnXx: Bonus rolls gave me something to do with this gold
[5:20:40] Kuroii_Ck: Reddit threads and wow forums
[5:20:42] Medobolt: Source: trust me bro
[5:20:42] byrdeen45: i liked those also
[5:20:42] reinhardtdog: And I miss those things lol
[5:20:45] Polkakungen: I was shocked when I heard they removed bonus rolled. So stupid.
[5:20:47] thiccsushi: I was fine with warforging since its only a chance to get a few ilvls
[5:20:54] icemanj99: I wish they would make Timewalking gear levels a good way to catch up. It's garbage right now.
[5:20:55] Molvonos: @ssbm_CK You should be able to find some examples then.
[5:20:57] Masqerader: no one wanted aoe cap, no one wanted loot nerfed, no one wanted bonus rolls gone, no one wanted switching specs to be limited, no one wanted another ap grind, and we got anima grind for leveling renowned early on
[5:20:58] ZeethianDragon: removing bonus rolls.  Why?
[5:21:01] Kuroii_Ck: they said it was TOO EASY to get geared whats the point of playing anymore was the major COMPLAINT
[5:21:09] Sollice: Residium was a PERFECT solution for people who complained abou t"too much loot"
[5:21:20] Arakai: Because we were wrong. "We think we do but we don't"
[5:21:20] ZeethianDragon: they hate to admit they're wrong so they drag shit out for months or even a year
[5:21:28] Sollice: You got loot you didn't want? DE for a currency you can save and get the specific gear you want
[5:21:29] casualfury: LUL
[5:21:33] Exodeo_: I actually miss TF and WF as a casual
[5:21:33] casualfury: 1 percent
[5:21:37] Unciatim: Cause the vault system sucks... it was suppose to be better and more predictive than Bonus Rolls... All I get is the same shit over and over again...
[5:21:45] synicx: mmochampion lul
[5:21:50] cineris_3: i disliked the loot balance between M+ and raiding
[5:21:59] Molvonos: Because people didn't bitch about it save for a few very vocal classic Andys who live to bitch about stupid shit.
[5:22:00] Herzenliegen: lol
[5:22:05] Mystirose: And then they put quest gear into the new patch on the PTR and it's 187 ilvl that no body needs anymore
[5:22:06] Zander_TheGamer: @Masqerader I wanted AP grind. I enjoyed it honetly.
[5:22:08] Molvonos: 'Too much loot', rofl.
[5:22:10] raptorstrick: That definitely would help casual players
[5:22:17] Aidler: I'm ilvl 200 and def not over geared
[5:22:18] dalaraz: i find the too many sources of loot income as a problem,not the amount @Towelliee
[5:22:19] ZeethianDragon: they are bringing back bonus loot for sure.
[5:22:19] brighadoon: Everyone complained about the game being a big loot piñata and getting gear wasn’t exciting
[5:22:23] Masqerader: only complaints i heard was "my zerg heroic mode loot feels unrewarding compared to mythic plus" please break mythic +
[5:22:24] Medobolt: they

[5:22:31] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Blvdman (warning)
[5:22:31] Thunder4o: the reality is that you cant keep casual players in the game for long time,doesnt matter what you do,this casual players are hoping around the games all around,they come and go,all you need to do is keep semi-casual,semi-hardcore and hardcore players
[5:22:42] Shrenko: classic players says its too easy to gear up in retail, probably them LUL @Towelliee
[5:22:43] DaruyDT: they should make m+ rewards like 1-4-7 10dungeons are way too many
[5:22:49] uawildcat04: !interview
[5:22:50] Armdel: isn't more so that with no TF/WF, people will feel "finished" faster, so to drag out that finished feeling, they are slowing down the gear acquirement
[5:22:53] casualfury: @Thunder4o show the data
[5:22:57] Sollice: @Towelliee So it makes you wonder is that an Ion decision to say " We can't say we were wrong" or is it a decision from above? Just say " We fucked up" and we will all move on and make the game better
[5:23:24] CardinalTX: the 1% felt gear was to easy for casuals.......ok fuck em nerf all gear rates......oh ya fuck tf wf
[5:23:27] Zhiovanni: WF is gonna be back lol
[5:23:35] ZeethianDragon: Blizz mainly listening to that 1%
[5:23:43] Masqerader: @Sollice its because Ion is by default a lawyer and lawyers hate to admit they're wrong

[5:23:49] pereadin: And then they'll send us to do timewalking legion M+ PogChamp
[5:23:50] thiccsushi: @Sollice He will probably say they wanted to test it and realized that the loot progression was too slow for some individuals yada yada yada
[5:23:52] toobaked1987: I think Blizzard thought there was a huge "collectors" mentality for this expansion. It DID NOT workout for them.
[5:23:54] 91Niki: Not me lol
[5:23:55] casualfury: LUL
[5:23:57] Sollice: That is probably very true @Masqerader
[5:23:58] TheGaoSora: WF better not come back lol going afk in LFR shouldn't be rewarded
[5:24:00] Ezekyler: Classic andies
[5:24:03] Arakai: "We" aren't going to be happy until our dopamine tops reach the levels of BfA and Legion, that's just the way it is
[5:24:03] Glozki: letting classic andys influence retail big mistake
[5:24:03] Polkakungen: @Towelliee do you think warforged was problematic? Titanforged for sure but warforged +5 ilvl could have stayed in.
[5:24:07] Thunder4o: ye cuz showering people with loot in BFA made numbers so big right
[5:24:10] d3momhunt3r1988: classic pog
[5:24:11] casualfury: true
[5:24:13] Colt_Engineer: sir classic takes 7 months to get bis's not 6 okay get it right lol
[5:24:14] Masqerader: I still got 213 weapon on my DH, thanks WOW vault
[5:24:14] Lulaboo: Thats me :D
[5:24:18] SilkeySmooth: so there is no point to play shadowlands until the last patch
[5:24:19] ElPolloBatman: that idea might've been okay when vanillia was around
[5:24:19] Alienfromger: meaningful item drops :P
[5:24:23] cineris_3: classics popularity may have had too much influence on SL development
[5:24:27] 91Niki: "fuck yeah, after 1000 hours into shadowlands i now got my bis gear. TIME WELL SPEND" OMEGALUL
[5:24:57] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: they shouldve made valor points 1 month into xpac
[5:24:57] Yagr6: 4 months and you are 205 then I’d say get gud
[5:24:59] PvtHudson093: @91Niki 9.1 is the next week, time to grind it out again but higher ilvl

[5:29:55] tdpark_: AYAYA
[5:29:57] Masqerader: tyrannical
[5:30:05] Thunder4o: at this point i cant understand what can keep casual players in the game,even if they send them full gear in mail at the start of the patch wont keep em
[5:30:19] Thunder4o: casual players in 2021 wont keep playing one game at the time for longer time
[5:30:24] Sollice: Ask him why you would buff DH single target demon bite and chaos strike and then turn around and nerf the recently buffed unbound cghaos lol
[5:30:27] ZeethianDragon: fortified idc but remove tyrannical
[5:30:31] Masqerader: 10,000 pet charm pet
[5:30:57] Sollice: No I know he wont
[5:31:08] Thunder4o: but there are already so many things to grind,chase as a casual player,what more they need
[5:31:17] Sollice: BUt I wonder how much they pay the monkey to put in the DH Havoc numbers in to the computer

[5:31:36] TheGaoSora: I mean, you get 226 from muscle memory pvp
[5:31:39] mytherel: UBC wasnt a nerf, they are just making what they said they were going to from the start...there are way bigger problems
[5:31:47] Thunder4o: @chizu_gg exactly,but that wont keep them ingame also,so blizzard should never cater to this hardcore casuals
[5:31:49] ZeethianDragon: make that shit account bound ffs
[5:31:49] Draduk: Conduits catchup
[5:31:50] casualfury: @Thunder4o you are just assuming stuff based on your subjective view without data
[5:31:51] ice_ross: Bingo board?
[5:31:56] Molvonos: @Sollice I mean, since HDH's only use 3 buttons, they prolly don't need many numbers.
[5:32:07] Unciatim: Its Hard to balance classes..... buts really easy to NERF EM TO THE GROUND..... lul.... @Towelliee
[5:32:13] FranciscoTheMage: why do they have to do something about stygia or soul ash? if people haven't been playing then they haven't been playing so they dont deserve ash.. @Towelliee
[5:32:14] Thunder4o: @casualfury 16 years expiriance in the game is good enough data for me
[5:32:16] ZeethianDragon: torghast needs better rewards
[5:32:23] Sollice: So 2 1/2 bananas. Should we pay them more to do a better job or less because they are doing a shit job
[5:32:23] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:32:23] volkreig: Loot philosophy changes
[5:32:32] Masqerader: its simple how they balance classes, round up all the melee classes, put a bunch of shitty affixes/mechanics in, cut of melee balls and put them in a pouch for range to carry around
[5:32:35] arthurdaley_: Tier sets
[5:32:36] TheGaoSora: Anima catchup, actual good anima catchup

[5:38:12] Medobolt: @hyvlaar yea
[5:38:13] mmrghost7: @ice_ross lies
[5:38:19] Masqerader: @Towelliee I think drums is important  having to need to find a hunter, mage or shaman for mythic + because of the 15%vs 25% nerf that made no sense

[5:38:33] casualfury: but media should serve the people and inform them
[5:38:37] Berren: We would get less answers if they werent sent before hand
[5:38:44] Medobolt: preach wont ask about tbc dont worry
[5:38:44] Holybytheway: Valor being made equal with honor and such?
[5:38:45] Invergamarium: What time is the interview?
[5:38:46] ncoots: Target cap question?

[5:40:57] ElPolloBatman: ask ion if he'll switch to overwatch 2
[5:41:11] Zander_TheGamer: Kinda, but will we need to get KSM again? If so then it is stupid. Because by the time we get it AGAIN, we won't need to the to upgrade gear unless they increase the ilevel we can upgrade.
[5:41:13] casualfury: league of warcraft
[5:41:17] jasperboy: SLG got their final nerf while they were progressing it

[5:44:14] Medobolt: zone to zone tps
[5:44:14] Kuroii_Ck: it should increase ilvl also imo
[5:44:23] MrGrimms: @Towelliee someone was saying they should do +10 ksm +15 portal +20 new tmog like challenge gear
[5:44:26] PvtHudson093: Just give a title at all 20's
[5:44:28] pereadin: Just in ttime too! cause I'm enjoying my paladin again KEKW
[5:44:51] moonscryer: +20 tier 3.

[5:44:54] arthurdaley_: Will flying be behind reputation?
[5:45:01] Blvdman: @Towelliee the teleport is actually broken. Players can now hearth out from an instance change talents/swap shit out and teleport back into the dungeon
[5:45:02] Xerevil: it's not that bad tho but i do i think  that having to do a 20 is too high for that shit.
[5:45:03] Murlocz: Also 1k gold from 60 to 70 @towelliee
[5:45:11] FranciscoTheMage: who's channel is the interview on again?

[5:45:23] ZeethianDragon: probably less than 2%
[5:45:39] garkhyt: By a score
[5:45:43] xXSiebzehnXx: I think then adding their own scoring system is good for like cosmetics design and stuff to be put in. Couple that with a better torghast incentivization and we got stuff to do buds

[5:45:46] Moobot: @Shrenko WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 25m 3s
[5:45:52] Contendedlemon: if they changed the +20 achievement reward into something better, rather than a stupid TP to the dungeon, itll be great.
[5:46:01] Yagr6: Unique accounts and not players with multiple alts
[5:46:13] 3663Sharad: The parses are not unique i think. so push groups count more than one
[5:46:19] Blvdman: 20 and up they'd have to really tune cases to be able to do 20s
[5:46:21] xXSiebzehnXx: @contendedlemon yeah that’s a dumb place to put them should be after all 10s
[5:46:29] moonscryer: LUL LUL

[5:47:40] dracullus: well there is no reason to do that, these are people that like pushing m+ just to push m+
[5:47:41] ArcaneSyntax: how many people you think play this game lol
[5:47:43] Vivelli: not everyone plays m+ tho
[5:47:45] dalaraz: 50k is 5% of 1million
[5:47:46] illi333: Those are characters. People do it on like 5 toons
[5:47:46] facerolljack: The real reason why that is is because half the players cant even try because they dont play meta speccs and cant get an invite xD
[5:47:48] Dreddmar: I’d say that’s pretty high. Is that 55k characters?
[5:47:54] DecayedmiNt: I mean only 2% kill last bosses of mythic. So it's smaller than that'
[5:47:56] Kuroii_Ck: thats prolly NA and EU together
[5:47:58] Blvdman: could be alts
[5:48:00] Blvdman: from same people
[5:48:07] Masqerader: if there was a way to check between fort and tyrannical it would be even better
[5:48:11] Crow_Bot: if that's out of 5M players, that's less than 1% of the playerbase
[5:48:11] dalaraz: but on those 50k done the same 5 people may have done 1k @Towelliee
[5:48:17] Kaynadian: It could be 50% of the playerbase and still the portal reward for 20's is still dumb on a patch you can fly.
[5:48:19] mythradrill: out of 55k 10k at least got boosted
[5:48:21] tempestmemes: 50k people from wows playerbase thats like 1-3% at most
[5:48:38] ZeethianDragon: you can't buy a +20
[5:48:40] Yagr6: I got ksm and stopped, I don’t see a point in pushing higher
[5:48:44] Medobolt: people are selling 20s now lmao
[5:48:44] ZeethianDragon: there's no way
[5:48:46] mythradrill: u cant buy 20?
[5:48:47] mythradrill: lol
[5:48:47] Crow_Bot: can 4 folks even clear a 20 on time?
[5:48:50] Elementlolz1: ya buy +20 not gonna happen
[5:48:51] Blvdman: buying a timed +20 gunna be like max cash
[5:48:51] casualfury: booster prices gonna rise
[5:48:54] Darquesoul: !room
[5:48:54] Moobot: @darquesoul Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:48:58] ZeethianDragon: 4 people can't clear a +20
[5:49:00] wastedx3149: people will buy it and make more money for blizzard cuz of buying tokens
[5:49:04] pereadin: 19 is tthe highest rn
[5:49:05] Sepron14: +16 is the highest ive seen sold
[5:49:05] tempestmemes: if this was bfa last patch then sure u can buy a +20 XD
[5:49:09] mythradrill: we r selling +22/23
[5:49:11] facerolljack: you can buy a +20 but only the extremely good players that are doing 25s etc can do that
[5:49:21] all_beef_franks: Degen’s are a different breed towel, don’t be surprised when it happens
[5:49:23] PawgersHC: grittz6690 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[5:49:26] Vivelli: is the +20 retroactive for this expac or nah?
[5:49:26] xXSiebzehnXx: People who do 20s only play with people they do 20s with. There would have to be heavy Sherpa incentives
[5:49:34] Kuroii_Ck: they would need to be good players themselves to be able to time it? unlesss gear carries that hard next patch
[5:50:14] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee i would want ION to answer the question about why would players use the in game M+ tracker versus RaiderIO

[5:55:42] equinox9210: if you time world quests the worst ones are actually only like 5mins long
[5:55:52] Armdel: main problem is the no "kill one rare and done" world quests
[5:55:59] Yagr6: The battleground community in wow is kinda neglected they need some love
[5:56:11] Arbszy: We got Scamazed

[6:02:59] ElPolloBatman: that's like asking to be flamed and for flaming
[6:03:07] AstridLory: I would be ok if it let you choose roles like overwatch
[6:03:14] Sepron14: Thats why they could add a class filter. so you can avoid bad comps
[6:03:14] zenothebambino: yeah there's no way they can give good comps every time
[6:03:19] BarthelemeusNL: i am just avroid that i get yelled at if i join on my tank

[6:03:55] Exodeo_: a dog not runining the carpet..gl with that one :p
[6:03:57] Kuroii_Ck: then classes would have longer queue times
[6:04:02] Kuroii_Ck: and it would be tilting that way
[6:04:24] Bakuryuha96: and if you want a filter for classes. You might as well make your own team
[6:04:24] FranciscoTheMage: SPV flooring?
[6:04:26] FranciscoTheMage: what is that

[6:21:18] Kaihrn: imperfect sense ofc
[6:21:22] Hitmanblood: all I hear is excuses.
[6:21:30] MasqureMan: Literally just remove conduit energy, it’s not hard. Talents aren’t limited
[6:21:30] firefly_on: of what?

[6:22:16] LeonardLongNips: This is why 9.1 won't excite people lol. TBC classic about to rein.
[6:22:16] Layercake: So many months to realize that was a mistake , after all feedback people give him in beta
[6:22:17] ZeethianDragon: Preach doesn't look happy
[6:22:20] Sollice: We want to give your more choices by giving you less choices!
[6:22:21] Lycis: but of course LUL

[6:23:25] Unciatim: @Nightshaft25 Thought peeps woudl like that.... hehe
[6:23:28] Blvdman: @Towelliee press that noise compression thing on the twitch thing

[6:23:33] andre_j2: he's low its not you
[6:23:33] dalaraz: you hear him fine when he turns to the mic
[6:23:33] Blvdman: might make him louder
[6:23:35] Shrenko: can hear him perfectly fine
[6:23:44] Masqerader: Just get rid of it conduit energy ffs
[6:23:53] Holysal: TBC wont kill it but supplement retail

[6:24:36] mavericks312: this was the perfect time waste question for ion
[6:24:36] Berren: I care tha he is taking 5  mins o explain
[6:24:37] wastedx3149: ion meeds to do an interview like this for tbc LUL
[6:24:39] Thoreya: Why add 78 new systems to an expansion but limit-ate how players can use the 78 new systems
[6:24:43] Sch1ey: ion just wasting time so he doesn't need to answer more
[6:24:44] pyrocannibal00: theres a dead horse in the room
[6:24:46] dergNwolf: if they can't be flexible, then stop adding systems fifiLUL
[6:24:48] Thoreya: Just provides annoyance
[6:24:52] MasqureMan: The problem is that there’s not even a reason not to change conduits
[6:24:58] ZeethianDragon: is Ian stalling?
[6:24:59] dalaraz: is this a 5 answers 1 hour interview ?
[6:25:03] Enigmio: wow we lost 10 mins on that stupid ass question
[6:25:06] spainard15: Doesn't the servers need people to play them or they are a big waste of money
[6:25:06] smashwow: this is literally the canned response, and it's awful
[6:25:09] justsimlol: there are some things that I wish they could just listen to feedback on
[6:25:14] Sollice: Maybe this is the problem with WoW right now. You have someone like Ion or his team throwing up barriers to non existent problems. See a smart man would just say FUCK IT GET RID OF ENERGY SO WE DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT ANYMORE
[6:25:30] rixbur: It is game devs are problem, not players.
[6:25:40] Molvonos: Hey Ion, how can you be so fucking stupid and get paid so much to say so little with so many words?
[6:25:41] Nightshaft25: More choices means More systems more systems more currencies
[6:25:45] Masqerader: just get rid of conduit energy, why is this such a hard thing for them to do? just remove the shit ffs
[6:25:51] smashwow: or you know throw out the energy
[6:25:52] xsp00n: move on....like you only have a certain amount of time for questions,

[6:26:04] dalaraz: yeah create more problems than what we solve,we know
[6:26:07] justsimlol: agreed @Sollice
[6:26:08] ZealotryTV: theres no need for any of that
[6:26:10] P1ght: @Molvonos he got a good deal and gets payed per word
[6:26:11] Berren: Next question plz ffs
[6:26:18] xhaven: @Molvonos he gets paid to do exactly that though
[6:26:25] MasqureMan: Should limit talents and gear switching too
[6:26:32] Unciatim: Premise is fantastic.. the implementation is dog shit
[6:26:58] ravenoushydra: I don't understand why even release thorghast in this state
[6:27:18] Molvonos: @Molvonos I prolly could do better when it comes to interviews, yes.  Instead of spewing rehashed verbal diarrhea.
[6:27:23] Lulaboo: No shit ion
[6:27:24] dalaraz: they should limit playtime or logins per day too
[6:27:30] dalaraz: as a timegate
[6:27:34] brain_wash: Nah player, losing on floor 18 of layer 3, thats the nut kick
[6:27:52] ZeethianDragon: that Tinman model in the background in the middle is awful looking

[6:28:58] useless_ezreal: Is the interview live?
[6:29:01] Sollice: @Lulaboo That's EXACTLY what I was thinking
[6:29:04] Masqerader: the challenge was fine, the problem was you gave some classes stupid OP powers, while others got shit ones that did almost nothing
[6:29:06] Molvonos: @Lulaboo Yep.  Which makes a Q&A completely useless and a waste of everyone's time.
[6:29:12] Ezekyler: Guitar Hero? boomer KEKW
[6:29:12] dalaraz: that interview adds nothing new,we know all that stuff

[6:32:57] Sollice: Super duper soul ash is what we have to do
[6:32:58] Molvonos: Only reward we're getting from Torg.
[6:33:00] Crow_Bot: i'm fine with that.  i don't want to feel forced to run Torgast for gear (other thant the Leggo of course)
[6:33:01] Masqerader: that dude with 50000 islands is gonna have like 1,000,000 torghast by the end of this expansion
[6:33:17] Thecustomdude: oouch no rewards
[6:33:23] smashwow: actually we get gear. we can make another lego when we switch covenants Kappa
[6:33:37] Sollice: @Crow_Bot Nothing wrong with giving Torghast as another source of gear, or transmog, pets, mounts etc etc etc etc 1000000 things they could give us

[6:33:59] Dhima: Dhima subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[6:33:59] ZeethianDragon: maybe give twisting corridors better rewards and mounts instead of just some crappy pet and a reskinned bear
[6:34:01] Alepouditsa: yea if i can solo the thing and get gear i will
[6:34:03] Glozki: throw tmog and a mount in torgast boom success

[6:45:44] Sollice: lol
[6:45:56] jasperboy: remind me to never piss u off, kk ty
[6:45:58] 91Niki: @Sollice I'm giving him the opportunity to rethink his choice and take his British rivalry somewhere else
[6:46:04] Lycis: FFXIV does it every expansion which is a great system

[6:47:01] eeliigaa_: new expansion? interesting.
[6:47:11] MasqureMan: If a class doesn’t need to be changed much, then just fine tune it
[6:47:17] Arbszy: @Lulaboo The start is so slow,, but after it amazing
[6:47:19] SpoonManes: ff14 raids have a lot of movement mechanics
[6:47:23] Zivs: oof
[6:47:27] ZeethianDragon: LUL
[6:47:29] MasqureMan: Doesn’t make sense to move away from what people like

[6:47:38] Shrenko: towOof

[6:47:46] Layercake: ''looking forward we need to find a middle ground'' needs to be in a shirt HahaThink
[6:47:49] Lycis: yea FF14 is more about mechanics not numbers
[6:47:49] Dagomarus: The passive aggressiveness is not helpful lol
[6:47:54] BlueBeast33: Bring back glyphs
[6:47:58] BlueBeast33: the system
[6:47:59] Fallensymbol: I wish i didnt feel forced to play the story to unlock stuff in FF14. The Game is fun otherwise

[6:48:12] Kuroii_Ck: ff14 is all mechanics and boring mechanics at best KEKW
[6:48:18] ZeethianDragon: How?
[6:48:24] Lulaboo: So with 10 min per question we got two to three questions left
[6:48:37] DrakhanGaming: WoW is just more pleasing to my eyes than ff14 visually
[6:48:37] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:48:37] poleon17: that's what a squish does?
[6:48:45] P1ght: @Fallensymbol jeah but ff is about the story. has some awesome endgame as well, but the story is just the main feature
[6:48:55] Arbszy: @ssbm_CK actually this expansion has had some really interesting mechanics
[6:49:01] thiccsushi: good question
[6:49:03] Dagomarus: Just Git good at your class Kappa
[6:49:06] Masqerader: oh u mean aoe cap?
[6:49:10] Arbszy: Light's Rampant though is a nightmare
[6:49:11] Blvdman: Didnt they mention that already in the other interview by changing the ilvl next patch
[6:49:13] TuhrbanNovice: boom
[6:49:14] HecticSpaniard: LULW
[6:49:14] idenkaz_: ?`what

[6:49:15] dutchie76: LUL
[6:49:18] mavericks312: damn said lower players are garbage
[6:49:19] ravenoushydra: damn ion straight up trashed them
[6:49:20] Lycis: oh oh ion disagrees

[6:49:21] cruzeal: LUL get good
[6:49:22] Molvonos: Fucking pleb
[6:49:22] Wedgeh: Just git good
[6:49:23] Fallensymbol: I rather play the story in a single player game @P1ght in a mmo i think its all about gearing and raiding
[6:49:23] YardRage: get good noobs SwiftRage
[6:49:24] Lycis: LUL
[6:49:25] Roth___: mans said git gud
[6:49:25] Molvonos: lolol
[6:49:26] MetaalMeneer: get good lol
[6:49:26] mwchaos: TRUE
[6:49:28] Sollice: 9.1 interview.....no actual 9.1 questions
[6:49:28] Thoreya: I fucking love this guy sometimes
[6:49:29] magemaster225: getgud - ion
[6:49:30] Murlocz: LUL
[6:49:31] r0b0tak0s: i love being bad
[6:49:31] Lulaboo: Sigh
[6:49:31] Unciatim: ION SAID IT... IF YOUR NOT MYTHIC RAIDER>> >YOU SUCK>...
[6:49:32] hoyhoy007: lmao
[6:49:33] mavericks312: get good casuals
[6:49:35] toobaked1987: BADDIES in 200 need to get on our level.
[6:49:36] Lycis: git gud
[6:49:44] Alepouditsa: we didn't even play back then tho
[6:49:45] Kuroii_Ck: @Arbszy they added a couple random mechanics and people are praising it like its revolutionary KEKW
[6:49:46] Murlocz: IF ur not a mythic raider you suck balls LUL
[6:49:48] r0b0tak0s: LUL
[6:49:50] P1ght: @Fallensymbol jeah but thats what the ff players disagree on. they want both :P
[6:49:56] HecticSpaniard: 30k health hit by a spell that does 30k plus.... just get good 4Head
[6:49:59] dutchie76: i play the game how the f i want shet
[6:50:05] dalaraz: 15 to 13 to 5 doesnt matter,better is better
[6:50:07] Lulaboo: So any actual 9.1 questions?
[6:50:11] dalaraz: new is new
[6:50:11] SonofHorus82: Damn Ion thinks I suck at the game. BibleThump
[6:50:13] Masqerader: imagine if I could hit all the mobs i was fighting
[6:50:16] Attackroot: towOny towOny
[6:50:19] Masqerader: but all the mobs can hit me
[6:50:27] Vivelli: @Lulaboo there was a few earlier
[6:50:29] DrakhanGaming: this interview just screams 9.1 will have no content
[6:50:34] Todmeister9000: Ion is right, I AM a noob FeelsBadMan
[6:50:34] Shrenko: doesnt look like people care about 9.1
[6:50:35] firefly_on: @Masqerader party members are 5 so yeah LUL
[6:50:36] xXSiebzehnXx: He said 97% of us suck LUL
[6:50:38] astreinoid: the same player can get very good damage with 200 ilvl... it is not 50% worse than 220 ilvl with the same person playing...
[6:50:38] deckardblade: this is a terrible question
[6:50:40] r0b0tak0s: towOny towOny towOny towOny towOny
[6:50:44] Sndhelp: just get PI an top the meters ;)
[6:50:44] toobaked1987: 20% more dps is a HUGE difference. I think ION is correct here.
[6:50:46] Fallensymbol: actually if i ever play ff14 again i might buy the story skips
[6:50:50] deckardblade: waste of 4 minutes
[6:50:57] berk2billups: why they should be so close
[6:50:58] RitzC: i mean the 9.1 questions were in the beginning lol, Ion just didnt have much to say
[6:50:59] Shrenko: Preach for game director
[6:51:00] DrakhanGaming: sounds like ion is sayin "dont get ur hopes up for 9.1, look for 9.2 and beyond"
[6:51:03] brighadoon: Preach is wrong and doesn’t like it lol
[6:51:09] PoppaShot: this has been a poop interview lol
[6:51:10] SilkeySmooth: that's fine for over but not pvp.
[6:51:12] mavericks312: yea preach is wrong on this one
[6:51:15] CCG_337: ion is laggin, bad answers too much
[6:51:20] Zander_TheGamer: I would agree it is a skill thing as well. I bet you put those mythic players in 200 gear and I bet the differences is as big
[6:51:20] CrunkyBrewster: thats fine. Im playing ESO lately anyways
[6:51:24] hausofalts: Sadly this is a 1% issue though
[6:51:35] 91Niki: The elk is at it again
[6:51:35] Shrenko: WutFace
[6:51:36] ZeethianDragon: LUL
[6:51:36] Zander_TheGamer: isn't*
[6:51:40] Jairoy: CHEWBACCA
[6:51:41] cruzeal: agane
[6:51:43] Lycis: @fallensymbol yea it gets great at Heavensward
[6:51:46] cabalish: towVACBOSS towVACBOSS towVACBOSS
[6:51:47] MasqureMan: Lmao
[6:51:49] MetaalMeneer: NEXT QUESTION
[6:51:50] astreinoid: but a medium player with 200 ilvl is just so bad compared to a good one with 220.. and that gap i guess is bigger then ever because there is so much borrowed power dependant on player skill and choice of skills + covenant + legendary+ soulbind + ++
[6:51:52] idenkaz_: what will eventually happen is that WoW turns into a M+ service game fir people like Preach. wtf is going on
[6:51:56] Enigmio: yeah we are talking 1% issues again
[6:51:59] Janigiv: @Towelliee are this questions pre recorded
[6:51:59] Dagomarus: Tbh getting from 200 to 220 is a lot of time and effort, you should see a good difference in power
[6:52:03] jasperboy: 🪚
[6:52:05] SonofHorus82: This does make me happy that new Fallout 76 content came out today. The game isnt for everyone, but I enjoy it.
[6:52:11] DrakhanGaming: blizzard paid him to ask certain questions LUL
[6:52:13] Blvdman: there we go
[6:52:16] Sollice: This is feeling more like a Preach discussing his issues with the Director vs a 9.1 interview
[6:52:16] Blvdman: catch up mechanics
[6:52:18] Fallensymbol: i heard that @Lycis but i get so tired of the story that i end up quiting before i get there
[6:52:24] dutchie76: oh really @SonofHorus82 ?
[6:52:31] Janigiv: @Sollice i agree
[6:52:31] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[6:52:39] hoyhoy007: very true
[6:52:43] CrunkyBrewster: since that NPC patch FO76 did a year ago, it's gotten better. It's a least "Like a Fallout" Game
[6:52:45] codedizle: @sonofhorus82 tbf fo76 is actually decent now
[6:52:50] CCG_337: I am playing wow and FFXIV, just I spent more time in FFXIV, wow feels lacking atm
[6:52:51] 91Niki: @Sollice That's just Preach tho. It was like that with previous interviews as well
[6:52:55] SonofHorus82: @dutchie76 yeah the new season, extra camp slots, perk loadouts all hit today.
[6:52:59] ZeethianDragon: I don't get why renown isn't account bound.  It's such a grind
[6:53:00] xmedpakx: it should take a while to gear an alt and make them "ready"
[6:53:03] dutchie76: oh nice
[6:53:03] Funderik: mass alt players won't be happy till blizzard let them just copy paste a template.
[6:53:06] nokster: @Sollice  there's almost nothing coming in 9.1 that you don't know from wowhead, what exactly is he supposed to ask?
[6:53:09] Gingerprimer: Stygia Catchup plz
[6:53:10] dutchie76: ill have to reinstall
[6:53:11] Amarlian: Renown catch up is great
[6:53:11] Lycis: @fallensymbol oh yea the story is the mainfeature, pretty long winded ar times i agree
[6:53:11] Lulaboo: I tried to play ff14. But slogging through all that’s Tory was not fun. I wasn’t invested at all
[6:53:13] CrunkyBrewster: yeah it feels more like an Actual Fallout game now, with some MMOish stuff
[6:53:17] Lulaboo: Story*
[6:53:20] dalaraz: on th e other hand,you dong have to have 12 alts lol
[6:53:22] jasperboy: Renown catch up is awesome
[6:53:24] Blvdman: @CrunkuTV how many years did it take for it to be better?
[6:53:26] dutchie76: same @Lulaboo
[6:53:26] Aravarth: Renown catchup is a joke, I was up to 40 on my main alt in a week
[6:53:30] Aravarth: cake
[6:53:35] Medobolt: @91Niki also he couldve been told he cant ask too many 9.1 questions
[6:53:35] Masqerader: At the rate i been facing palming this interview, I am gonna have a perm handprint on my face
[6:53:36] Berren: Im mostly playing wow cause ff is lacking atm
[6:53:41] CrunkyBrewster: @Blvdman a good while LUL like 2 and a half almost imo
[6:53:41] Thoreya: I made a hunter last week and got 30 renown yesterday. Renown grind isn’t bad
[6:53:45] P1ght: @Fallensymbol jeah that happens to a lot of players. the communit knows that most people quit a few times before reaching the end. but the newest expansion ist just damn good if you followed the story
[6:53:48] dalaraz: you shouldnt have 12 alts and all being up to date of your main
[6:53:51] toobaked1987: WoWhead already tweeted out Ion's "get gud" comment. hahaha
[6:53:53] SonofHorus82: @dutchie76 same. I havent played since early march when I finished last season. Excited to get back ino.
[6:53:58] Hitokiri83: Anima for BoA gear on alts
[6:54:00] CCG_337: understandable, ffxiv and wow tells the story in ver different ways.
[6:54:02] Fallensymbol: also to be honest I have all my friends in WoW, If i start playing FF14 it feels so lonely
[6:54:04] ZeethianDragon: LUL Wowhead on the ball
[6:54:08] Sollice: Don't call it a Chains of Domination interview then. Call it a State of the Game Q/A.
[6:54:09] Unciatim: Understand this.. Preach thinks that most of the Dev are FOS with their answers.. he trying to provoke a different answer than the RoBoT answer.... But yes... he likes to charge that hill ION is camped on....
[6:54:11] Fallensymbol: so i just stick to WoW
[6:54:11] Anderus00: i purposely did different covenants on alts just to experience that story but shouldnt feel like a grind either
[6:54:19] 91Niki: @Medobolt I mean that is possible yeah. They might have told him it's very limited to what they can currently discuss. So he's chosen to go another route to not waste time asking questions that won't be answered
[6:54:21] CrunkyBrewster: ESO was the same way to me though. I remember hating ESO. Even in the beta I was in for it. And it never got good to me til around the Morrowind content
[6:54:27] 3663Sharad: Conduits are way more harder to get to an good state on alts, than renown imo
[6:54:30] Dagomarus: Tbh alt catch up is good on every level except gearing
[6:54:30] Medobolt: yep
[6:54:30] Lycis: @fallensymbol fair enough
[6:54:32] Sollice: wowhead only has whats been datamined or released on the patch. They dont have everything on 9.1.. Give us some fun info we dont know yet
[6:54:41] ZealotryTV: they want to play the game?? wild
[6:54:43] codedizle: @lulaboo it is if you can get passed arr and first expansion into stormblood it's really good, but ya it's a lot
[6:54:48] xmedpakx: please give more anima ,, like massively
[6:54:52] rolando415: 9.1 September
[6:54:53] nokster: @Sollice  bruh, theres nothin in 9.1, the state of the game in general is wahts important, get it
[6:54:56] DrakhanGaming: They need to punish people for  leaving M+
[6:55:01] CrunkyBrewster: He's not wrong
[6:55:10] idenkaz_: there isnt much too talk about because they datamined everything already KEKW
[6:55:12] Sollice: @nokster Then again lol....Dont call it a 9.1 interview.
[6:55:16] PToastman: That’s what I do

[6:55:18] ZeethianDragon: HE'S RIGHT
[6:55:20] Lycis: LUL
[6:55:20] dalaraz: im with ion on that
[6:55:22] codedizle: I just recently got into ESO a lot lately enjoying the hell out of it honestly
[6:55:22] Aravarth: YES AND TRUE
[6:55:23] Ben99: I do exactly that, he is right lol
[6:55:25] Unciatim: @DrakhanGaming Yep..... Like... a 2hr CD to reQue
[6:55:26] RquesTR: xD
[6:55:26] CrunkyBrewster: although for me I never i became an Alter around WoD. before that I played alts towards the end of an expansion
[6:55:27] Funderik: he is right
[6:55:28] dbeezie14: hes very very wrong
[6:55:29] LuciWho: Hes right ypu have groups
[6:55:30] galinhoo: he is right
[6:55:30] xhaven: there are most people are that way
[6:55:32] Finni2011: need the journey
[6:55:32] Arocian: like the journey
[6:55:33] dracullus: of course his right
[6:55:33] Sincline387: Classic proved there were alot about the journey
[6:55:34] Lycis: Hahaha
[6:55:37] Gingerprimer: He is right and wrong
[6:55:40] Enigmio: just let us choose??
[6:55:42] strike879: just a treads of fate for that too
[6:55:44] Unciatim: God.. Ion is so out of touch....
[6:55:44] Chelidda: Yup, I'm super casual, I need stuff to do on alts too :)
[6:55:45] Enigmio: like the fate system
[6:55:45] SilkeySmooth: ion is out of touch
[6:55:45] RuFFyLyx: damn Blizz are always happy about their systems, and they are pretty much the only ones
[6:55:46] Timkoch02: But that is me
[6:55:46] nokster: @Sollice  his title is "A Conversation with Ion Hazzikostas "
[6:55:47] MasqureMan: I’ve got a friend who loves alts
[6:55:49] Zander_TheGamer: I dunno man, I kind of agree with Ion here
[6:56:03] Lycis: True
[6:56:06] CrunkyBrewster: like up until WoD, I was a regular raider
[6:56:10] Sollice: And his backround is Shadowlands Chains of Domination
[6:56:15] Kuhbreeguh: No one creates alts to do world quests.. especially not the ones we get now
[6:56:25] Sollice: So remove that and just put a normal shadowlands backround and we all good
[6:56:29] Enigmio: yeah like m+
[6:56:32] ZeethianDragon: the problem with threads of fate is   it can take a good while if you don't have a group
[6:56:34] nokster: @Sollice  and my background is witcher 3 yet im watching wow, whats your point
[6:56:34] Unciatim: yea well... TOF doesn't help you get past the Renown/Animai/Stygia grind
[6:56:40] Sincline387: Just limit buying/upgrading covenant gear to the renown level the quests unlock
[6:56:41] dutchie76: shocked they havent put a skip in for that yet
[6:56:41] dbeezie14: this is a wow discussion all the questions are nerdy
[6:56:42] jamiboiy: except you get like 3 dungeons you have to run again and again levelling LUL
[6:56:43] dbeezie14: lol wtf
[6:56:45] Gingerprimer: The Maw intro takes like no time and gives you almost 1-1/2 half level
[6:56:46] MasqureMan: They should just give a giant xp boost for threads of fate
[6:57:01] jkitchin75: any 9.1 stuff
[6:57:01] Sollice: @nokster Right. That's exactly the same thing
[6:57:02] Gingerprimer: 0.01 % quest
[6:57:04] toobaked1987: Back to the 1%. This is why he should NOT interview.
[6:57:04] Alexkayzz: 1% question answer: yes next
[6:57:04] samzavin: Healer DPS...  WTF is he smoking...
[6:57:06] 91Niki: LUL
[6:57:10] Finni2011: nooooooooo
[6:57:10] dalaraz: more like 0.01
[6:57:10] Anderus00: nerf healer dps BrokeBack
[6:57:12] Todmeister9000: are we getting a maw intro skip?
[6:57:13] CrunkyBrewster: threads takes me about the same amount of time if I did it normally. like 3 to 4 days, if i played 4 - 6 hours a day. Its mostly because I'm solo doing this
[6:57:14] Lycis: towShappens towShappens
[6:57:18] ZeethianDragon: 0.01% question
[6:57:18] nightmayor12: this is not going great
[6:57:18] Amarlian: they could just do the opposite and buff all the healers
[6:57:20] magemaster225: holy shit healers coming with the pitchforks
[6:57:32] nokster: @Sollice  It is, you complain about his background for no reason, its a fuckin background
[6:57:35] dbeezie14: no one cares about this
[6:57:35] Blvdman: holy pally were already gunna get destroyed
[6:57:38] Aravarth: Is it just me, or is Preach LITERALLY THE WORST
[6:57:38] Blvdman: in 9.1
[6:57:39] ZeethianDragon: holy paladins are meant to do DPS to heal
[6:57:48] MasqureMan: Healers are more than 1% aren’t they?
[6:57:48] Sollice: @nokster Your right. I was THE ONLY ONE who thought this chat was going to be about 9.1 info
[6:57:51] Shrenko: he said middle of an expansion. Shadowlands confirmed 3 patches towPog
[6:57:51] Sollice: Sorry my bad
[6:57:52] 3663Sharad: You have to be good, to get a healer to DPS like a DPS. Its a team effort
[6:57:54] dalaraz: @Aravarth you are exagarating a bit :p
[6:57:54] Karemabdual: Its literally only Hpal
[6:57:59] CrunkyBrewster: thats probably why i prefer Holy over Ret
[6:58:02] nokster: @Sollice  not my fault people cant read
[6:58:04] Blvdman: hammer of wrath gunna cost a fuck ton of mana
[6:58:06] Aravarth: @zeethiandragon Indeed, hpallies need to generate holy power through damage abilities
[6:58:08] CrunkyBrewster: Ret is just ugh.. not fun to me
[6:58:10] Dagomarus: Your doing a 9.1 interview who cares about damage healers LUL
[6:58:11] Crow_Bot: this is like Bankers talking to the President about double-taxation on dividends.  Nobody cares except them

[6:58:14] Kuroii_Ck: overall healers do like 3 % damage in a M+
[6:58:16] jasperboy: Give us MOP disc back
[6:58:19] Funderik: do all healers need to be the same tho, let some deal damage. don't make it boring.
[6:58:21] Rictamar: @Sollice there isn't much to talk about for 9.1 I'm afraid
[6:58:24] Shrenko: ok next question Ion, we get it !!!!!
[6:58:26] Lycis: towHesaidit
[6:58:28] Karemabdual: THere is nothing wrong with Disc, Disc is well designed. Hpal has been the only problem for years
[6:58:28] samzavin: Everybody here has a healer...   Just like YOU have a HUNTARD...    LOL
[6:58:33] Lulaboo: @nokster hey just chill. This interview is rough as it is
[6:58:39] Kelticlore: I wouldnt mind where if you did the main quests that lead to getting quests for dungeon on main and doing them having the quests popo up in the dungeons on alts if you want to spam dungeons on alts
[6:58:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[6:58:43] Rictamar: @Sollice it was 20 min at the beginning of the interview lol
[6:58:45] toobaked1987: also HOW IS THIS A NERD QUESTION????
[6:58:47] dalaraz: hpaladin is just fine,people just care bout meters
[6:58:48] tacsquatch: has the question been asked why every dps has to go NF?
[6:59:12] Sollice: Nah he's right Lula. I am a fucking idiot because I thought he would talk about upcoming 9.1 info. I don't know how to read
[6:59:21] Sincline387: Ashen Verdict is the worst thing to happen to holy paladins ever....
[6:59:21] idenkaz_: no joke, i really think they datamined most of 9.1 already. there isnt much to talk about. @Sollice  :-(
[6:59:40] Enigmio: rip hpally
[6:59:48] Crow_Bot: coin rolls.  Cmon Ion
[6:59:48] Vajazle: Vajazle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[6:59:49] codedizle: so nothing about 9.1 has been talked? LUL just tuning in was afk
[6:59:49] BlueBeast33: Preach stated multiple times this interview would be a mix of 9.1 and other things

[7:06:13] Sndhelp: preach should ask how ion would play denathrius without a warlock
[7:06:19] wreckshoptv: lul
[7:06:31] Kelticlore: stop putting all/most of the bad stuff in melee range then going with less melee so healers can do better would work

[7:08:15] ZeethianDragon: necrotic forces you to kite
[7:08:17] dbeezie14: 2 targets.....my THURN
[7:08:21] Dagomarus: Remember when tanks needed skills like pulling and kiting LUL
[7:08:21] seo1978: then make them talents and giove that option to polayers instead of you choosing qho is capped and who isnt

[7:09:19] Unciatim: @RS_Iron_Jay No.. actually we aren't
[7:09:24] Kableiz: you do WQ for anima now.. basically de aP of legion..
[7:09:27] Funderik: @RS_Iron_Jay yes.
[7:09:27] Aravarth: Then I was right! @Moonphire lol
[7:09:27] dbeezie14: literally no one cares about anima
[7:09:33] SonofHorus82: I'll take anything over Anima right now.\
[7:09:36] dalaraz: we removed the farm/grinds and managed to get a worse expansion,thats a miracle
[7:09:41] ZeethianDragon: anima doesn't really make you strong like artifact power did
[7:09:42] CardinalTX: anima?    wrather have an enima
[7:09:48] Kelticlore: getting anima from WQ is a joke to me dont get enough like we did with AP for legion and BFA
[7:09:54] mrpresbaby: That doesn't bother me
[7:09:56] Sincline387: in the same chat "no one cares about anima" and "GIVE US MORE ANIMA" roflol
[7:09:57] Sollice: @Towelliee Didn't you say Preach told you IOn was going to give us something new and interesting we didn't know about earlier?
[7:09:57] CrunkyBrewster: We're still doing that only in longer phases now
[7:10:02] ZeethianDragon: anima is just..  save the zones, get trash costmetics
[7:10:03] mrpresbaby: I'd rather have quick WQs
[7:10:03] Anderus00: its terrible in SL. have to go thru oribos when flying instead of straight shot
[7:10:08] dbeezie14: i would rather lick glass off the ground then do the anima quests
[7:10:11] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i would rather doing quick ones
[7:10:11] RquesTR: i liked flyin over gave me time to chill
[7:10:15] Amarlian: 35 anima is not anima
[7:10:17] CrunkyBrewster: legion quick if you know whati mean

[7:10:26] Dagomarus: Once flying comes in travel time to quest completion time will be irrelevant

[7:10:30] Alepouditsa: ok 40 anima now Kappa
[7:10:34] Amarlian: 35 anima is not rewarding i mean

[7:12:24] Sollice: I wonder....Are we saying it's a shit interview because we didn't get 9.1 info? Because you know this isn't a 9.1 info RIGHT
[7:12:28] ZakuzaGB: what exactly were people expecting
[7:12:29] ZeethianDragon: Torghast should've had some kind of mage tower type stuff

[7:13:30] BubbaChubbs420: we kinda knew that
[7:13:30] nightmayor12: pretty meh interview tbh
[7:13:31] Lycis: towUnforch
[7:13:31] ZeethianDragon: I didn't learn anything from this
[7:13:33] Justarandomman: We learnt preach is going buy ION a beer
[7:13:33] dalaraz: nothing new
[7:13:33] Vivelli: little bit more torghast info i guess on the changes?
[7:13:35] grizzlyhorn: ion said 9.1 is soon TM
[7:13:36] dbeezie14: we didnt learn shit. bunch of shit questions about meaningless stuff
[7:13:38] Shrenko: nothing
[7:13:39] Ezekyler: we learn about after 9.1 will come something
[7:13:39] dutchie76: LUL
[7:13:39] DrakhanGaming: you sound like a robot in a tunnel @Towelliee
[7:13:42] dergNwolf: I learned that Preach still didn't let go, is that something that counts?
[7:13:43] BRUTALIT0PS: That was kind of a waste of time imo
[7:13:46] toobaked1987: @Towelliee we learned this is going to be a very long expansion.
[7:13:46] Sollice: He didnt say anything about 9.3
[7:13:50] belfmasterracer: can we just have BFA back?
[7:13:50] Murlocz: I dont see myself playing retail until next expansion, specially with TBC coming soon
[7:13:51] xXSiebzehnXx: Learned more lawyer transitions
[7:13:51] BlackSnake100: amz is getting nerfed
[7:13:52] Shrenko: he said we was in the middle of expansion though @Towelliee LUL
[7:13:54] MrGattz: it sounds fine
[7:13:55] Yngvezs: seemed a bit "political" lots of questions beeing answered with another question
[7:13:56] mmrghost7: ok......
[7:13:59] Sollice: @Towelliee Your fine
[7:14:04] 91Niki: @Towelliee It's just the saw in the background that makes it sound weird
[7:14:09] dalaraz: its the drill makingyou sound like a robot :p @Towelliee

[7:14:11] Kromede: towBeep
[7:14:11] Anderus00: beep boop
[7:14:11] idenkaz_: " its a skill issue " Kappa
[7:14:12] dutchie76: wtf
[7:14:12] Shamwise: No, sounds normal
[7:14:13] SilkeySmooth: torghast advancement tied to your performance is bs
[7:14:15] BRUTALIT0PS: Sounds good to me
[7:14:16] Ghostzapp3r: Time to go all in on tbc
[7:14:18] DrakhanGaming: its adjusting now
[7:14:18] CrunkyBrewster: you're fine
[7:14:19] Lycis: We learned that casuals suck and you gotta git gud first
[7:14:21] codedizle: as much as I love WoW  I think I've just gotten to the place where I'm just super burnt out and hungry for something new and nothing is really "new" just same stuff same grinds essentially, I enjoy watching streamers like towel play more then playing myself LUL
[7:14:21] ahriok: Sounds like you're back in your 1 bed apt :)
[7:14:26] mavericks312: biggest thing i learned was players need to get good
[7:14:26] Lulaboo: Going into TBC
[7:14:27] Shamwise: Its times like these im glad im a casual...
[7:14:30] Lulaboo: Here we giooo
[7:14:33] RitzC: @Towelliee what exactly did you expect to learn that hasnt already been datamined or asked in previous interviews?
[7:14:35] Alexkayzz: I liked the part where Ion told Preach to git gud LUL
[7:14:40] Vivelli: 9.1 doesnt look its doin much to pull me in
[7:14:41] deckardblade: literally 0 discussion of M+ changes
[7:14:43] ZeethianDragon: 40% of the questions being 1%
[7:14:45] abbotatoes: Maybe those were the only things they would approve talking about... ?
[7:14:47] Ponickz: just alittle echoey
[7:14:50] Sollice: This interview did NOTHING to excite us about whats to come at all
[7:14:51] xsp00n: We learned that 1% doesnt like covenents still
[7:15:01] dimofodi: I feel like a lot of these interviewers are scared they won't get another if they ask a question the community actually wants an answer to. @Towelliee
[7:15:02] SilkeySmooth: 9.1 looks bad tbc waiting room please
[7:15:07] Alepouditsa: i am felling like i watch a video from Bellular were i know what i knew befor i watch it.
[7:15:07] dutchie76: 9.1 will be eh
[7:15:12] kowaikoro: content drought and we get no hype sadge
[7:15:23] dbeezie14: herp derp dps healers....how come

[7:15:32] DrakhanGaming: blizz wants us to play TBC its pretty clear at this point
[7:15:33] Sollice: @Towelliee Until he gives us the answer that Preach wants
[7:15:34] Tarfu: I want to hear his thoughts on TBC
[7:15:36] Funderik: @Towelliee we learned "something big is coming after 9.1"  :)
[7:15:37] wreckshoptv: only reason too play 9.1 is getting my covenant mounts...
[7:15:39] Kelticlore: when we getting rid of borrowed power LOL
[7:15:41] xmedpakx: i am hyped about tier/class sets
[7:16:00] xmedpakx: but thats it , it seems
[7:16:00] xsp00n: cause Mike has dumb quesstions,but he wants an answer that he wants, so he asks the question in a different way, but its still dumb AF. so then Ion gives a dumb answer like "just play nightfae 4head"
[7:16:01] nox503: nox503 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[7:16:04] ZakuzaGB: what questions would you have asked? @Towelliee
[7:16:16] galinhoo: most of the questions were "are we getting rid of this?" "no" "ok"
[7:16:22] SilkeySmooth: @ormenlange123 and flying for 9?2
[7:16:23] BlueBeast33: Ion just gave a lot of disappointing answers...I don't see the point in putting everything on Preach here
[7:16:26] pavepawns: i like borrowed power but i also dont want my borrowed power to replace talents i had (legion example they used)
[7:16:26] Kelticlore: if borrowed power is done right and make ssense for the expansion i dont mind
[7:16:28] LeonardLongNips: borrowed power isn't bad in itself, but doing every single expansion sucks.
[7:16:30] wreckshoptv: @SilkeySmooth ye
[7:16:38] c0mmander_starscream: yeap
[7:16:48] porowozek: Preach's interview was as usual about himself
[7:16:50] BRUTALIT0PS: Agreed
[7:16:50] Layercake: Borrow power is way easier to balance for them
[7:16:51] josh8555: borrowed power and permanent power
[7:16:56] Enigmio: yeah it feels fresh
[7:17:00] Sollice: Give us new talents
[7:17:00] bc_23_: Is the interview over?
[7:17:02] c0mmander_starscream: Thats what Peral Abyss does with EVE Online now
[7:17:08] Rictamar: @porowozek what are you talking about? lol must be trolling
[7:17:08] oxidexd: @Towelliee never thought id hear Ion of all people say "it's a skill gap issue" lol
[7:17:10] Kelticlore: I liked what they did with our abilities for WOD while Levleing
[7:17:17] dalaraz: unless it is actually th e same but 5% reformed,thats not new
[7:17:23] DrakhanGaming: covenants are dope
[7:17:26] mavericks312: ion roasted about 60% of the player base
[7:17:30] Waspire: clip this !
[7:17:37] fubarian297: they need to stop with the over hauls and make something completely new
[7:17:38] Waspire: for later on
[7:17:38] dbeezie14: it needs to continue, but it needs to be refined and well thought out
[7:17:43] dbeezie14: spend time perfecting it
[7:17:43] MrDToTheIzzle: I just dont want another "power this item with this new resource" thing. Its getting stale
[7:17:44] Arocian: borrowed power has its place in the game
[7:17:46] bc_23_: !interview
[7:17:46] Crow_Bot: oh hell no!
[7:17:47] Moobot: @bc_23_ WoW Ion interviews starting at 10am PST aka 22h 53m 3s
[7:17:47] DrakhanGaming: I wish they would try to make garrisons beyyer
[7:17:48] ravenoushydra: no offense to all the people who are emotional in chat right now but trashing Preach just because he asked about things you don't care about is just toxic and childish
[7:17:49] Funderik: let borrowed power be BORROWED.
[7:17:50] DrakhanGaming: better*
[7:17:56] galinhoo: covenants are nice but they should stay indeed (some made talents₩
[7:17:58] ZeethianDragon: aoe cap better stay in shadowlands
[7:18:01] A_Klimas: imagine the reaction: "Hey guys, good news, Anima is sticking around for another expac."
[7:18:02] SpenceSir: what did i miss ? Anything big from the interview?
[7:18:08] MikeyA1256: dont think he spoke about M+ and valor enough. a lot still unknown with new M+ systems
[7:18:09] Aravarth: Agreed. Borrowed power should be borrowed, not permanent.
[7:18:15] FerociouzMonk: wtb new talent rows... and abilities.
[7:18:20] MasqureMan: Conduits and artifact traits are nearly the same things
[7:18:28] Rictamar: yeh the Preach hate here is ridiculous, jesus chat
[7:18:28] L1ghthoof: I prefered the legion artifacts because they were class themed. not a fan of generic borrowed power
[7:18:29] HeatherJC83: @Towelliee PREACH BROTHA
[7:18:32] Arocian: the effects are broader
[7:18:48] HeatherJC83: HeatherJC83 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[7:18:49] ZakuzaGB: @Gylduran  agree
[7:18:49] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[7:18:51] Enigmio: true
[7:19:00] dbeezie14: thats a 100% better way to ask that question youre right
[7:19:11] galinhoo: true
[7:19:11] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[7:19:12] BlueBeast33: @Gylduran Unfortunately this happens here every time. This chat hates him for some ridiculous reason.
[7:19:18] Funderik: there doesn't need to be a catch up on that tho, that's standard gear progression. do better content, get better gear.
[7:19:19] duhworks: and M+ loot being higher Ilvl
[7:19:20] jazzl3: I like borrowed power just hate how it seems certain things within our borrowed power are designed solely to increase your gametime played
[7:19:21] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: that was so bad
[7:19:22] mwchaos: the way he posed the question was def not the right way
[7:19:23] pavepawns: i 100% disagree with the dmg thing from 200 to 226
[7:19:32] swordart_19: Just get good 4Head
[7:19:36] dbeezie14: just not the best interviewer. he couldnt adapt there. just reading the question on the paper
[7:19:37] swordart_19: they are just bad nothing else
[7:19:51] rockthefries: @Towelliee your 100% right ive been like 205 for months
[7:20:01] galinhoo: give back titanforge
[7:20:07] Gingerprimer: 3 pieces from M+ should just come back
[7:20:11] Rictamar: @BlueBeast33 yeh I don't get it, Preach is always fair and he doesn't mind being wrong, he corrects himself all the time
[7:20:11] dbeezie14: not optimal but you arent missing a bunch of power
[7:20:12] josh8555: seemed nervous he was sweating alot so that might have a bit to do with it
[7:20:12] astreinoid: but its not the itemlevel gap that is the reason but how much optimizing can happen with all the additional borrowed power.. because the borrowed power has so much choice... so it also has so much "bad" choice
[7:20:16] Vivelli: there should be a cap on TF/WF based on the content
[7:20:28] swordart_19: just baddies are baddies nothing else LUL
[7:20:30] Sincline387: TF/WF is really what did it, but pissed almost everyone off in the process
[7:20:32] mavrikbtw: How has there been obstacles when its all devs?
[7:20:32] pavepawns: i wouldnt mind warforging but titanforging i feel is too much
[7:20:33] idenkaz_: thats what kept casuals playing. no they left. at what cost tho :-(
[7:20:33] Funderik: i don't think that's a problem with the game tho. that's people not doing the right content to get geared.
[7:20:34] Sollice: No one hates Preach.
[7:20:35] Rictamar: @BlueBeast33 People just assume things about him without watching his actual content, its sad
[7:20:36] mavrikbtw: that makes 0 sense
[7:20:38] swordart_19: and whole interview was purely biased for raids nothing else bad interview .
[7:21:02] mavrikbtw: @swordart_19  100%
[7:21:03] Attackroot: that damn hakkar tank trinket wont drop... lol
[7:21:05] KinggKebab: i mean hey gave us valor
[7:21:06] mwchaos: the power gap between 200 to 220 should feel big. I don't think that was a problem to begin with though. bridging that gap is the problem.
[7:21:10] MikeyA1256: visions gave almost mythic raid level gear for solo content lol
[7:21:13] verdant85: verdant85 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 100% Agreed
[7:21:16] astreinoid: the bad covenant ice mage with the wrong legendary and weird soulbind and 20 itemlevel gap is sooo much worse... even if it is "fun 2 play"
[7:21:28] ZakuzaGB: being the interviewer isnt as easy as it looks
[7:21:35] Thunderlops: Not to mention it’s hell getting invites on alts around 200 ilvl
[7:21:49] swordart_19: @Thunderlops stop fucking lying
[7:21:50] Waspire: are they not  wanting to  extend the life cycle  of wow?
[7:21:56] MikeyA1256: visions....
[7:21:59] Tigerklaue: all my twinks are itemlvl 200 and are stuck there
[7:22:00] galinhoo: I hate how they are making pvp gear good for pvp, raid gear good for pve, m+ gear good to get fucked?
[7:22:03] Kelticlore: I never mind having Warforged it was how titnaforge was implemented I had an issue with
[7:22:06] swordart_19: Do content and get rewards.
[7:22:06] KinggKebab: Valor has that. can literally farm +2 keys and can get 220 geared
[7:22:07] mmrghost7: yuuuuup
[7:22:13] swordart_19: Baddies are blocked by own skill nothing else.
[7:22:17] codedizle: hell I'm a average casual player  nowadays and just gearing a main is a pain in the ass LUL
[7:22:21] MikeyA1256: dont think he spoke about M+ and valor enough. a lot still unknown with new M+ systems
[7:22:22] Attackroot: only if u have dont +15's
[7:22:25] Attackroot: done*
[7:22:27] Rictamar: @swordart_19 that is simply not true lol
[7:22:28] Sollice: @ZakuzaGB It's not for sure. But I wish him and Sloot both would learn when Ion isn't going to give them a substantive answer and move on. But your right it's not easy
[7:22:30] mmrghost7: casuals dont like when u cock block them , they just leave
[7:22:30] pavepawns: yo get good fam
[7:22:34] swordart_19: @Gylduran it is get good
[7:22:43] pokerigo: they talked about nothing
[7:22:45] barkiethebear: @KinggKebab yes valor can get ur to 220 but u need ksm to do that
[7:22:45] galinhoo: @kinggkebab if you farm +2, you will have to still do a lot of 15s to get the gear to upgrade
[7:22:49] shmasherd: it was weak
[7:22:49] Murlocz: @Gylduran Hes a LFR raider no need to give attention
[7:22:50] Enigmio: nothing, just nothing
[7:22:55] jazzl3: LUL
[7:23:01] napur_a: hahaha
[7:23:03] Masqerader: It was a Seinfield interview was about nothing
[7:23:06] Rictamar: @swordart_19 you are a troll LFR raider lol I'm done ResidentSleeper
[7:23:09] BadXo: there is an alt grind because 1% of the pop wants to grind on their alts - Yes, you are out of touch Ion
[7:23:10] BackwardsCompatible: Did they discuss the kite tank meta in mythic+
[7:23:13] Lycis: yo u aint playing WoW for fun, git gud LUL
[7:23:16] astreinoid: the problem is.. 9.0 already has so much borrowed power systems...and they are not l inear.. but provide choice...
[7:23:19] Sollice: That's EXACTLY was the interview. It was LITERALLY the same as the past 2 interviews
[7:23:21] mwchaos: well they spent a long time on covenants and conduit energy for no reason...
[7:23:22] dsj0: yea it was a weak interview
[7:23:22] swordart_19: @Gylduran you sound like one wanting gear for norhing .
[7:23:31] Loonytic: live or bc? which is best
[7:23:36] dergNwolf: it was kinda datamined ye
[7:23:37] voordeelpot: its fun for a couple of weeks thats it
[7:23:41] CrunkyBrewster: nope
[7:23:42] Sollice: You get 5 gems
[7:23:43] pavepawns: we know a mount
[7:23:43] ZeethianDragon: that is not a fkn reward
[7:23:45] Sollice: HORRAY?
[7:23:46] Rictamar: @swordart_19 I haven't played the game in months, nothing about 9.1 excites me
[7:23:49] Aravarth: The reward is getting fucked in the ass WITH lube instead of WITHOUT lube
[7:23:49] Masqerader: @Towelliee wasn't it talked about in the weekly reset?
[7:23:55] Shamwise: Your reward is to have fun....duh
[7:23:55] Masqerader: when he did the gems and stars shit
[7:23:59] brain_wash: "You always have your soul ash"   Thanks....
[7:24:05] xmedpakx: some cool wep mogs would be a nice reward imo
[7:24:11] Unciatim: @Towelliee Check out Preaches Twitter.... The meme
[7:24:20] mwchaos: right? lol.... what did you expect him to say
[7:24:28] oxidexd: @Towelliee at least ion fucking acknowledged amz is too strong xD
[7:24:28] barkiethebear: torghast just wans to take my soul from me whenever i go in there
[7:24:28] WolfMan4500: wait why are we using LFR raiding as a degrading term here?  some people dont have the time to play for an entire normal raid.
[7:24:30] Sollice: He is a 100% is
[7:24:38] Kelticlore: needs some kind of reward even if its just giveing us trasnmog, or have it drop rep tokens
[7:24:40] MikeyA1256: pvp gear for pvp. raid gear for raid. but kinda left out M+??
[7:24:44] Lycis: yea all those systems collapse like a cardhouse
[7:24:44] Masqerader: and now every DK is gonna wanna murder him
[7:24:49] mwchaos: conduit energy was such a cuck.
[7:24:53] Sollice: WHY ask a question you KNOW the answer to. And he has answered it the same way multiple times. Ion will not come out and say it is wrong
[7:24:55] SavageCheez: Because Ion told him to ask it
[7:24:57] Vanhoek: He also said get good.
[7:25:05] Broomba: content creators are failing the game by catering to those who care about the questions preach asked
[7:25:07] Holysal: @MikeyA1256 m+ isnt a pillar for gearing in devs mind is why
[7:25:14] Mitune: it killed me to hear that the Sylvannas bow new ability thing was just for this case. It seems like such a good thing going forward
[7:25:15] MikeyA1256: :(
[7:25:17] pavepawns: we all know preach sported a boner when ion said no
[7:25:22] MasqureMan: @towelliee I like when he asked if class sets would have set bonuses and Ion was like, “that’s what that means, yeah”
[7:25:25] PvtHudson093: https://twitter.com/RogerbrownWoW/status/1387106109190721539?s=20
[7:25:29] kowaikoro: what even is 9.1 LUL
[7:25:32] codedizle: so the wow team is happy with it but the players aren't LUL something I'd wrong with that picture
[7:25:32] theoneeleven: @Towelliee Limit Maximum asked preach to ask about conduit energy
[7:25:35] grevior: Even though, I feel like preach always gets the most relevant info out of an interview @Towelliee
[7:25:39] Tigerklaue: all we get with 9.1 is a small new zone
[7:25:41] illuminationpaladincurse: give tbc already
[7:25:45] thenaylander: its pretty concerning that nothing seems solidified in the patch yet
[7:25:48] feelswyzman: tbc is 100% before 9.1
[7:25:49] drwest132: i see tbc coming before 9.1
[7:25:50] BlueBeast33: TBC is definitely first now
[7:25:51] ravenoushydra: Honestly I think a lot of the disappointed people should ask themselves if they are disappointed with the answers instead of the questions
[7:25:56] dsj0: Even Ion seemed way more excited for 9.2 and we are not even close to 9.1. That is not motivating
[7:25:58] pavepawns: @grevior we got barely any info from this interview. the one yesterday gave us actual info
[7:26:03] Lulaboo: https://twitter.com/maximum/status/1387105706231349255?s=21
[7:26:04] xmedpakx: lots of time to enjoy other games hehe
[7:26:06] Enigmio: korthia is smaller than mechagon
[7:26:07] RageerPLZ: @Towelliee I am the same way, when I am involved in a question with my work I feel the need to explain every factor that relates to the question, and end with yes/no rather then just give yes/no.
[7:26:11] zeiours: What time is the awesome announcement?
[7:26:14] SavageCheez: TBC in June
[7:26:17] Tigerklaue: hc gear from world content would be great
[7:26:22] Talason: when benethic gear was better than mythic gear?
[7:26:23] Masqerader: it's like nazjatar will do some shit, learn to fly and get ksm and quit till 9.2
[7:26:24] Kpxt: Kpxt subscribed with Prime. 
[7:26:26] Sollice: @ravenoushydra Both. Questions asked weren't amazing and the answer's given were standard par for the course Ion speak.
[7:26:28] Aravarth: Who doesn't want a mana pearl necklace Kappa
[7:26:30] TielemWoW: TielemGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[7:26:31] Broomba: @towelliee - sadly i am ready for 10.0 there is no reason for me to play wow SL now til 10 cause the system is broken and doesnt favor the causal player like legion and bfa did which i grinded the f out and enjoyed
[7:26:32] Rictamar: the WoW team is happy that players pick the meta Covenant instead of the one they actually want to looloool
[7:26:37] MikeyA1256: pls just make valor to 226 :(

[7:27:28] Mitune: How did you feel about the Sylvannas bow and other unique items just being for this raid? It seems like such an awesome thing that they could take forward.
[7:27:29] mavericks312: the legend himself IFU
[7:27:35] ravenoushydra: @Sollice I saw you get really emotional over the lack of 9.1 questions. But Preach asked about covenant legendaries, korthia and torghast in 9.1 and I think we got as much info as possible about those. What else could have asked about 9.1
[7:27:40] galinhoo: imfiredupThumbsUp imfiredupThumbsUp imfiredupThumbsUp

[7:29:18] DehCantao: Ellesmere and automaticjak. Are you ready to see double healer with disc and hpally?
[7:29:21] Rictamar: they need to pick like io level 200 ppl for the memes
[7:29:24] Sollice: @ravenoushydra I't s a game I am not emotional. He could have asked the simple question....Anything in 9.1 we haven't seen Data Mined or in PTR or is that everything. That would have been a very vague question that could have taken us in to some additional undisovered things
[7:29:25] MikeyA1256: if only blizzard cared about m+

[7:32:32] barkiethebear: what do they play
[7:32:32] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[7:32:32] Rossii77: Do your research an see who tanks for them on a regular
[7:32:39] ravenoushydra: @Sollice I mean for once he did ask just that about korthia and we got an answer, regarding questlines and the power grind there. Other than that he probably would have given a vague answer that we'd find through datamining anyway. Since we haven't datamined anything else they're probably not ready to discuss it if there even is something else
[7:32:55] Thunderlops: Is your rando your healer?

[7:33:40] Sollice: @ravenoushydra Your probably right. It would have been nice for Ion to give us something undiscovered though to help build anticipation. Just was very flat
[7:33:41] Layercake: Or he could be and Echo or Limit healer
[7:33:50] Shallo1988: Towel is gunna be healer Kappa

[7:41:25] Demkie: you still think pre patch Is coming in may despite Ion not saying anything ?

[7:41:29] YZIOHP: I can hardly hear them

[7:42:27] kokochris: I like that too, but just want more of a reward (hopefully)

[7:43:09] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: ION said couple weeks until 9/1

[7:43:40] soysos91: o.o
[7:43:45] fantasynerd69: Wow needs a new direction.  Ion needs to go
[7:43:46] Vanhoek: I dunno if may will even be prepatch release I mean they dont even have it in the PTR yet for testing.

[7:45:52] ravenoushydra: how long does it take to put those zones in tho they're literally on retail LUL
[7:45:55] kokochris: @Zander_TheGamer actually it is JIF. the creator confirmed that.  this is an age old debate
[7:46:19] vhaal97: I thought Ion handle himself well in that
[7:46:29] LorienV: @Towelliee Vegas is poping right now.
[7:46:39] Zander_TheGamer: Hard disagree
[7:47:12] Vanhoek: Gamble all them stimulus cheques
[7:47:13] Orctopus: Was there something so bad about the old endgame systems that we have so much shit layered on now? I mean would it be so bad to go back to like MoP-era basic systems but just have all that dev time spent on more content instead?
[7:47:22] kokochris: @Zander_TheGamer there is no disagree, the creator said it. your just wrong
[7:47:48] ravenoushydra: I think there's too much
[7:47:49] casualfury: LUL
[7:47:59] ravenoushydra: They need a smaller system that is more impactful
[7:48:01] ElDrakenMan: towelliee you get our stimulus cheques Kappa

[7:49:00] casualfury: yes but if first patch gonna take 9 months I am fine with old stuff
[7:49:10] JokaThS: door of shadows
[7:49:21] Masqerader: np sir
[7:49:29] Layercake: And them people will complain that is rehashed content  HahaThink
[7:49:34] ravenoushydra: well if you compare soulbinds to the artefact weapon, soulbinds don't even come close to that level of excitement
[7:49:51] VictorAvalanche: You could change the tree's on artifact weapons
[7:49:53] casualfury: was bfa something new ?
[7:50:00] xPockitzx: bring tier sets back!
[7:50:02] dalaraz: i dont like how we scrap something the moment it finally works

[7:52:25] shimwood: They should have done it with people who have no IO, that'd be entertaining
[7:52:29] NotAnotherNettie: brewmaster is pretty forgiving if your healer is from the community
