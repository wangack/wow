[0:56:34] Eleanor_Heals: Yes! D:
[0:56:44] Pmanson: dont heal warlocks!
[0:56:46] Astrosparkle: Just keep Windfury down. Drop Stoenskin or SoA on larger or longer pulls. iirc prioritize using Healing Wave instead of Lesser to heal.
[0:56:47] innerstswe: and allllot of drinks u need :P
[0:56:49] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:57:06] Eleanor_Heals: Think it's better to do a healing wave rather than 4 lessers.
[0:57:08] Astrosparkle: Can use Rank 1 Windfury totem to save on mana.
[0:57:11] diabl712: dont heal the lock if he life taps
[0:57:35] lahuskie: anyone know what realm @Swifty is on
[0:57:37] Jysser: wf totem is lvl 42 bros
[0:57:43] Eleanor_Heals: No no, rather than 4 lessers, do 1 healing wave :)
[0:57:45] Pmanson: DONT HEAL LOCKS!
[0:58:04] Tomoglaziat: ! som
[0:58:11] Tomoglaziat: !som
[0:58:11] StreamElements: Swifty is on Nightfall (PVP) Horde for Seasons of Mastery
[0:58:18] Eleanor_Heals: Yea, you'll need to swap through ranks to preserve mana. You should be fine
[0:58:27] itta_pupu27: Use some lower rank heals saves mana
[0:58:47] Thomusus: It's only a big healing wave if you Mexican wave the camera at the same time, or so I heard :D
[0:58:59] Astrosparkle: Mana Spring isn't worth keeping down if you are moving at a good pace. It takes like 20s or something to break even and will restart the 5s rule as well if thats the only thing you cast.
[0:59:24] Eleanor_Heals: Astro is right yep
[0:59:41] Clownkrisp: cant shaman use wand
[0:59:47] Stropalot: Was that a Hunter wand?
[0:59:49] Thomusus: swifty = orc wizard from hogwarts
[1:00:05] Pmanson: never
[1:00:16] Eleanor_Heals: Not until your 50s, I believe.
[1:00:19] Astrosparkle: Flametongue as caster

[1:04:47] thamysticog: swifty buy the Pvp tabard for the stylöe
[1:05:11] Astrosparkle: Pretty much just keep R1 Windufury down for trash. On larger or harder pulls also add Stoneskin or SoA. Other than that just conserve mana and don't restart your 5s rule unless you are healing. You don't really want to DPS as a healer in Classic.

[3:12:49] keekdafuq: good evening Sir Swifty!
[3:13:11] tafreshy: they dont in bear form
[3:13:11] crakajaxx: @swifty you should look up macros for dropping specific sets of totems. I know you're a macro fiend on your Warrior and Paladin...but Shaman have some good ones as well.
[3:13:11] MooBoibeepboop: @swifty start by saying you're a good guy. I never watch streams, I just heard we had a big streamer bolsterin our numbers horde side. First time watchin ya - Okay, im 100% mistaken on thinkin all "big streamers" have -that- mentality. ima say that now, you offering to pass was a baller, humble move, sir. Props from -<Orc> :D
[3:13:13] Cowardpatty: Because they bite and claw
[3:13:15] Stangin2122: they dont technically use a weapon in Classic
[3:13:17] Klanransalee: they are not attackignw ith there weapon
[3:13:17] Contii1: they hit with paws not weapon lol
[3:13:20] suga817: cause they dont swing
[3:13:20] StevoVonBrown: yes save us us
[3:13:21] Klanransalee: they are using there paws
[3:13:40] trogzar: Yall not get DDos'd?
[3:13:42] aviduser2: druid only use weapon for stats. DPS doesnt matter
[3:13:46] trogzar: also hi
[3:13:58] Thomusus: @rakaflakkkaflame Swifty = Underrated
[3:14:00] aviduser2: thats why druid BIS weapon is a mace from gnomregan
[3:14:07] malterek: I did
[3:14:13] Stangin2122: Not in Form..they use paws
[3:14:14] suga817: with agi
[3:14:17] Cactigh: Swifty is there a class you have absolutely no interest in playing?
[3:14:20] aviduser2: they do enchant but for stats
[3:14:23] worriedstif: when they are in a form its considered unarmed
[3:14:24] aviduser2: like +agi
[3:14:24] BiggcombsTV: Druid weps are just stat sticks
[3:14:24] Stangin2122: Stats is all the weapon is
[3:14:27] Cowardpatty: Just stats
[3:14:28] Aforemore: it doesnt work while they're in forms
[3:14:30] Cowardpatty: Like Agility
[3:14:33] Goguakagod: ye
[3:14:36] suga817: u dont need weapon skill
[3:14:42] crakajaxx: @swifty you should look up macros for dropping specific sets of totems. I know you're a macro fiend on your Warrior and Paladin...but Shaman have some good ones as well.
[3:14:45] Tomoglaziat: claw claw rake rake
[3:14:47] Cowardpatty: Yeah, but DPS is scaled to form.  So only stats matter, not weapon DPS
[3:14:47] Goguakagod: their damage is also not affected by their weapon
[3:14:47] CaptainKanje: ''Windfury is only applied to the main-hand weapon. It isn't even applied feral druids since they aren't physically attacking with a weapon.''
[3:14:51] Goguakagod: only the agi stats etc
[3:15:16] rbubbaray: I cant log in game now , and when I say why the mod blocks  me
[3:15:22] Warmtofu: the reason why Manual Crowd Pummeler from Gnomer is a Druid BiS for Feral is because there is no weapon that increases Feral dps - so the MCP from Gnomer increases attack speed by 50% for like 30sec

[3:16:30] rbubbaray: @aviduser2 yeah but I want them to know
[3:16:33] suga817: ya they farm it
[3:16:36] Warmtofu: Exactly, so you have to farm them over and over
[3:16:39] Warmtofu: during the week
[3:16:42] crakajaxx: @swifty you should look up macros for dropping specific sets of totems. I know you're a macro fiend on your Warrior and Paladin...but Shaman have some good ones as well.
[3:16:43] Goguakagod: thats why they must farm 4-5
[3:16:43] suga817: takes no time once ur leveled
[3:16:45] Stangin2122: They farm a bunch
[3:16:48] Cowardpatty: Yeah,60 feral druids have to farm them

[3:17:08] Goguakagod: yea those shoulders wouldve been nice for you
[3:17:13] Cowardpatty: That's why I didn't choose feral druid again

[4:57:39] Slayer_Eagleone: Classic fresh season of mashed potatos
[4:57:48] MooBoibeepboop: u meant rfd, right?
[4:57:52] 5_0_trees: nice

[4:58:22] raynz85: okay 40 it is
[4:58:31] raynz85: i got master seartgent an am 37
[4:59:09] Cybernytez: not on Dreadnaught xD on my server alliance loses every BG ^^
[4:59:09] MooBoibeepboop: 65/35 split
[4:59:24] Padwani: You can tell where people are in leveling by cloth prices. When Silk is @ vendor Price and mageweave is 20s a piece everyone is around 40
[4:59:30] thamysticog: @Cybernytez you play against whole eu dude
[4:59:42] amarranth: bonus honour weekend?
[4:59:50] EliBourne: so all the horde players are playing alliance and all the alliance players are playing horde lol
[4:59:52] Garanoose: I’m lvl 23 alliance is it worth me doing pvp or lvl up
[4:59:55] Cybernytez: @thamysticog  yeah i know i mean eu ^^
[5:00:12] EliBourne: 40-60
[5:00:19] sharkgaming_thomas: No dude
[5:00:23] sharkgaming_thomas: not what he meant :D
[5:00:27] Skycoh: i thought it was wool for rep
[5:00:33] empathgod: lvl 23 is not worth pvp
[5:00:45] WalkOff: hes saying the cloth is on the AH for about the same price as vendor price
[5:00:49] Garanoose: Thank you
[5:01:12] Jakebeercan: Is there not a daily limit on the XP from the quests?
[5:01:12] Padwani: Each cloth drops in a certain level range, you can see where people are by checking cloth prices. Mageweave is really high because people are jsut hitting 40 but silk is cheap cause it starts at 30
[5:01:18] Padwani: Seems like 35-45 is where most people are

[5:02:31] WalkOff: 50 bracket is 50-59 right? i dont wanna do bgs vs lvl 60s
[5:02:34] madzaid: one hunter had 1.3k gold already doin dmt
[5:02:36] Divinedreaming: i would just save all your consumes and sell when people had gold
[5:02:41] Divinedreaming: nothing is really selling for much
[5:02:47] zeddsith1: change RFK to RFD in your guild chat
[5:02:51] back2r00ts: yes

[6:09:01] GoodBuffalo_: the smaller car u drive the more likely this will happen

[6:09:38] ralposki: Electri cars are top, drove a taycan turbo s and i almost crashed when i pressed the gas slow when standing still
[6:09:43] johngalang6: They need to make electrical cars more affordable though.
[6:09:44] EvinceTV: electric car safety?
[6:09:59] rbubbaray: they make the electric compay richer
[6:10:10] raynz85: they dont all have more torque, they generally make great torque figures but electic start making power right at 0 RPM, naturally aspirated engines have to get going to make their power.
[6:10:11] Wahcha27: im gonna go watch fuegoPls  fuegoJAM now, peace swifty!
[6:10:13] Volare__: but they are just as bad on the environment, batteries are horrible, you also have to think how a community generates its energy.

[6:12:36] gojirawhales: NA gas prices are cheap compared to EU
[6:12:37] johngalang6: electric cars are still more of a status symbol than economically viable
[6:12:45] ralposki: @brodycanuck they don't have to atm, but they will be obligated to do so in future
[6:12:48] EvinceTV: if you want to sit in a microwave sure get a  electric car
