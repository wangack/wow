[0:13:21] TheBr0ther: We hope to not wake up kekw
[0:13:52] silas__nielsen: Ginger does help tho
[0:14:09] deathvolt96: I think you will enjoy gnomergan, really fun for casters and higher difficulty than bfd
[0:14:34] Clinsure: Still bad. Should have been permanent 50% exp buff in SoD
[0:14:34] vacerss: btw altercan mountain ogres can drop a healing rune also
[0:14:42] aManWidaPlan: i have severe reflux, my sphincter is fucked up, my father has it too, high acidity also. What helped my reflux tremendously is an easy cocktail every morning on an empty stomach- glass of water, table spoon of vinegar, apple vinegar is best, table spoon of lemon juice, and a teaspoon of honey if you want. great stuff. you can google about it if you think im just a retard.
[0:14:53] JohnTheTurtleMa: Honestly in stellaris rp people should just make empires that they feel like rping and not that are broken meta
[0:14:58] TheBr0ther: But if you are playing by yourself debuffing armor doesn't metter because you don't do any physical damage tho right?
[0:15:07] BustlingGames: May be your confusing Ginseng with Ginger?
[0:15:42] vacerss: shadow priest is very opp right now

[0:16:25] astiwana: That mat noise is gifted

[0:16:47] Huntin_Dusty: facts
[0:16:54] TheBjornen: Most paradox games are the most fun in the beginning
[0:16:56] JohnTheTurtleMa: Do you plan to get meds for the rp or not?
[0:17:00] truder_0: the main issue is the price of the dlc to play the game
[0:17:07] JohnTheTurtleMa: *mods
[0:17:09] aManWidaPlan: imperator rome smoking in the corner rn
[0:17:09] kin_seward: stellaris first ever game, almost nothing can beat

[0:17:18] Huntin_Dusty: @truder_0 you just summed up paradox
[0:17:23] kin_seward: you are so immersed in it

[0:19:07] moultinus: @kin_seward is that an issue content wise?
[0:19:13] clocklock90: Hi tommy how are you?
[0:19:16] JohnTheTurtleMa: You are a youtuber too you just dont need to edit your vids
[0:19:25] mironp: You said you don't want to change Stellaris because devs should make it fun, but do you play hoi4 that way?? @tommykaylive
[0:19:43] spaceboiakspace: have you ever edited a youtube video? @TommyKayLIVE

[0:21:21] uplockk: it is very hard to enjoy this game i agree :tf:
[0:21:23] TheBjornen: Kebab sim 4 habibis youtube video = 50 mil views

[0:22:47] absoluteHabibi: yea that‚Äôs different tho @mironp
[0:23:22] SaboteurLT: How was adaptation to kindergarden for your kid?
[0:23:23] absoluteHabibi: job security, salary and benefits and 401k plans are different than paying a random guy 50$ per video
[0:23:41] spaceboiakspace: what's your cut on youtube dommy
[0:23:43] AIM_the_Bulldozer: Just asking, any kebab today?

[0:24:48] absoluteHabibi: he‚Äôs saying @mironp that you need to pay percentage to highly motivate your editor. I agree with him
[0:24:58] mironp: I dont get how you can watch same series all the time...
[0:25:01] moultinus: What do you rate higher? The Sopranos or The Wire?
[0:25:10] causin_drama: @tommykaylive do you have a favorite soprano season
[0:25:12] AIM_the_Bulldozer: yes but I doubt uploading clips makes any money?
[0:25:21] absoluteHabibi: sopronas is really good
[0:25:21] paradoxia411: @absoluteHabibi if you are looking for an editor i would be interested if i could use it in my portfolio

[0:26:12] hengest488: sure tommykSheep tommykSheep tommykSheep
[0:26:13] PabloTescobar26: Same with breaking bad. First 2 seasons are funny and upbeat then after that it gets dark and depressing
[0:26:24] scottish2000: is the walking dead still going???
[0:26:26] absoluteHabibi: have you watched 4 blocks @tommykaylive
[0:26:28] AIM_the_Bulldozer: Schindler's list is the most successful movie at making you not like watching it
[0:26:30] mironp: @absoluteHabibi I just dont agree. its is job like any other job. Do you think editors in Hollywood are paid like that?
[0:26:33] chadson421_: a-a-a! Stay alive, Stay alive!
[0:26:36] absoluteHabibi: that‚Äôs my favorite German show
[0:26:59] PabloTescobar26: Amazing movie
[0:27:15] absoluteHabibi: @mironp bro you aren‚Äôt going to have the best highly motivated editor for 40 usd per video
[0:27:34] FeldyTV: Well you had your chance to watch it Kappa
[0:27:38] mironp: @absoluteHabibi I dont say you cant pay that way, but I dont think its condition. And where did I say anything about 40$
[0:27:50] moultinus: Did you watch the movie based on the Sopranos?
[0:27:58] jassafstuhldichein: doesnt chat get older to as you get older ?

[0:28:15] FeldyTV: Nah your not disconnecting, there is too much stuff out there to see all of it
[0:28:33] aManWidaPlan: Convince me to watch sopranos
[0:28:35] babyyodavb: did you watch 24?
[0:28:43] mironp: @TommyKayLIVE do you think the guy that edited Endgame got paid 100 million for that, because he got percentage??? How am I wrong here?? KEKW
[0:28:46] jassafstuhldichein: chat gets older as you get older so the disconnect shouldnt get bigger am i wrong ?
[0:28:48] pijuus_i: so you hate the black people, tommy?
[0:28:49] Italianolegend: it was better than nothing
[0:28:54] moultinus: Even the word Sopranos is great, comes from italian for sovereign, i.e the ultimate authority
[0:29:02] dellar10: please
[0:29:03] Italianolegend: anytime you can get back into that world i wont say no to it
[0:29:06] dellar10: explain
[0:29:13] causin_drama: the best part of that movie was gandolfinis son I thought he was good
[0:29:30] Stello96: if you could get a sequel to any movie what would it be
[0:29:37] absoluteHabibi: bro you are talking about jobs that have job security, retirement plans, health insurance, high base salary and most like incentives
[0:29:45] LandoOnline: I agree, too much explaining shit
[0:29:54] Bittereballen: favourite sopranos character?
[0:29:55] stompiwompie: you taking wow slow?
[0:30:13] mironp: @absoluteHabibi I know bro! I was not talking you shoud do it... I was talking about BIG youtubers the whole time...
[0:30:17] absoluteHabibi: very little YouTubers can supply that. all Tommy and I was saying that if you want a highly motivated guy who sits through hours of grand strategy gameplay, it‚Äôs better if you do percentage for motivation.
[0:30:22] Italianolegend: hbo didnt invest the money that they needed too for that one
[0:30:30] JohnTheTurtleMa: I honestly need to drop a show an watch what Tommy watches it sounds so fun

Despite this significant influence, their dominance appears to be met with minimal public discourse or challenge

[1:24:15] ramz9900: Tommy, I would enjoy speaking with you lol, It would be fantastic.
[1:24:20] Stello96: Inflation is the highest its been in 20 years, millions of illegal immigrants who are getting temp visas while vets are on the streets. Biden is literally senile, and to top hes corrupt as shit. But corruption isnt much cuz all us politicians are corruptsd
[1:24:24] ramz9900: Biden will be remembered as a good president
[1:24:26] The_Bear_U: veryCat rage baiters having a blast rn

[1:24:28] ramz9900: Trump will be remembered as the worst
[1:24:37] aManWidaPlan: I did you didn read. Im not gonna type it again cuz i dont give a shit what a clueless german not an american voter thinks about biden @tommykaylive
[1:24:59] The_Bear_U: @aManWidaPlan veryCat mad?
[1:25:02] hussar1683: @ramz9900 He is going to be remembered by the "shaking no one" memes
[1:25:21] aManWidaPlan: @the_bear_u not at all. Why would i be?
[1:25:22] Thewanderingplayer: Trump wouldn't have worked against the Texan border control measures
[1:25:28] absoluteHabibi: yea we wouldn‚Äôt have inflation but we would be in a recession which would be way worse
[1:25:34] Lonelywolfski: I am not watching for the gameplay, i am here for the discussions
[1:25:35] GiuseppeJM: @Stello96 inflation rates are literally as low as they were during trump, they are constantly lowering corporations are price gauging still because people are paying the prices. Why are immigrants bad? they literally work the jobs that no one else wants to work.
[1:25:37] Huntin_Dusty: How do you feel about Biden being openly against gay marriage and segregation when he was a senator? @TommyKayLIVE
[1:25:40] kin_seward: for that reason I feel like a two-party democracy cannot ever be a real democracy as there is not much variety in the voting parties, they both make false promises to get voted in and almost never achieve their goals if if they do its never to the extent promised
[1:25:44] gltamt: its not Biden running the country its his administration
[1:25:48] baelor2001: tribalism is the real problem dommy. Political tribalism, religious tribalism, etc
[1:25:48] Stello96: @GiuseppeJM https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/
[1:25:48] The_Bear_U: @aManWidaPlan veryCat well you sound like it
[1:25:57] Stello96: @GiuseppeJM you were saying?
[1:25:59] Evold_Nepsy97: would trump have forgiven any studen loans at all?
[1:26:03] kin_seward: but at the same time, two-party democracies are hard to get out of because nobody wants to "waste" their vote on a smaller party that will never get voted in
[1:26:04] Capyblapy: at least biden isnt threatening to take away rights from ppl
[1:26:06] spaceboiakspace: Technocracy lacks its democratic principles of democratic representation, in which small group of elites could form elitism of establishment of authoritarianism, it could be like Nazi Party coming in pwer in Germany, as the A.H cabinet were filled with all intelelctuals controlling the populace easily (their IQ tests done in Nuremberg trials proves that) @TommyKayLIVE
[1:26:07] PabloTescobar26: Arguing about politics with most people is like smashing your head against a wall and expecting it not to hurt LUL
[1:26:08] TheHardestOfArchibalds: Inflation isn't bidens fault. It's the result of printing money to stimulate the economy during covid. would've happened anyway @TommyKayLIVE
[1:26:20] RyanSvN: what do you think of US response to izzrael
[1:26:21] GiuseppeJM: @Stello96 i may have been wrong about it being the same but you can see th epositive decline lol
[1:26:31] bfanschutz1: The inflation was around 1.9% during trump and 5.7% during biden
[1:26:31] ramz9900: Everyone is corrupt, name one president that was not? Trump is an authoritarian, working on nationalism. I am confused, has no one played HOI4? Biden is just a mediocre president, a lot of his actions are actually not that bad.
[1:26:31] davee1203: Money printer goood brrr
[1:26:35] gltamt: @TommyKayLIVE do you think we need younger people getiing into politics like 30-40
[1:26:44] Stello96: Well no shit, after fucking it they are gonna try to fix it??
[1:26:44] prophet_san: the problem with trump is, that he destabelized the whole world with his actions when he was a president and stability is what we need the most in the moment i think
[1:26:45] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @Thewanderingplayer He wouldn't have to, the texans would not even do anything to begin with. The only purpose of the border stuff done by texas is to make biden look weak
[1:26:53] Capyblapy: i also think ppl put too much power on the president. in reality they dont control everything lol
[1:27:02] Fluetify: @ramz9900 eisenhower
[1:27:03] JohnTheTurtleMa: Hamasmant???
