[3:27:24] Takeadat: Ryzen CPUs are incredibly good at multitask capability. Really any modern CPU can. If you have modern Hardware, I would say it is more up to your internet on if you can stream well.
[3:27:28] Englesyn: what kinda pizza

[3:30:51] KodiakJedi: NF is BIS for the sepsis build and assassin
[3:31:48] D3xterTV: Hello there
[3:31:49] EvoCyberNation: There has always been a disagreement between AMD vs Intel. With Intel and AMD coming out with their new CPUs. AMD still hasn't caught up with Intel's 12900k

[3:33:07] Johnkw: started
[3:33:18] Englesyn: yeah its like 6k now i think
[3:33:42] Englesyn: ROTH IRA is, you pay tax now, and its tax free when you pull it out
[3:33:45] ironmouse34: always Roth....taxes will only keep going up....better to pay the lower tax now then the higher one later
[3:34:18] Englesyn: your 50?!
[3:34:25] EvoCyberNation: @TheEndIsNear777, I have no issues. At first, there was an issue with the *MOBOs,* but with time, most have resolved the issues. Intel does want people to use their proprietary software, but you don't need it.
[3:34:33] pharmztko: i thought youwerr 30
[3:34:38] unmatched45: how are you 50?!?!?!
[3:34:43] unmatched45: thought you were like 42

[3:34:55] DeeDotLIVE: dang you look good for 50 man I thought you were late late 30s early 40s
[3:35:02] EvoCyberNation: Intel had some updates and the motherboard manufacturers needed to update their software. So there was some slight hickups.

[3:36:47] Raskar4855: anyone know the link to Swifty's armory page?
[3:36:47] EvoCyberNation: @TheEndIsNear777, I would wait till the newer gen comes out. AMD was facing Intel's 12700k and couldn't beat it. You can take that with a grain of salt. Intel's 13000 will be more expensive than their current 12000 series.
