[0:54:26] ShadowFallTV: it might be an addon, you can google it offstream "hide chat button" in google.

[4:24:48] DarkRedux: Asmon wasnt the only one doing it. Almost all the world first guilds were also
[4:24:49] Nitelyter: No it got disabled because RWF players requested it to be disabled because it affects them.
[4:24:49] binx_x_: i saw it like 20 mins ago
[4:24:51] AMadDragon76: 100%
[4:24:51] Towbiekun: Don't think it is because of Asmon specifically, because people were doing it for RWF too, and it might've been unfair.
[4:24:51] flashnickgg: Madge asmonbald
[4:25:02] binx_x_: baldy big mad
[4:25:10] Nitelyter: Asmon even said that on stream it had NOTHING to do with Asmongold doing it.
[4:25:10] zlvashlz: whats RWF?

[4:26:00] Nitelyter: considering it's the highest ilvl gear you can get including better than mythic dungeon gear, yes, yes it has a lot to do with RWF and is currently bis @Cafe0le
[4:26:08] fuqlae: @shroud chances u getting on lost ark again..
[4:26:26] Cafe0le: @Alt_Codes that gears is so bad compared to what you can get in m+
[4:26:41] Cafe0le: wf raiders didnt care about it
[4:27:06] sarg1010: FROM DOOOOOWNTOOOOOWN
[4:27:14] Nitelyter: Yes that's true, but would you rather go into heroic raids or m+ with 369-372 ilvl or would you rather go into it with an advantage at 382-390 ilvl?
[4:27:44] FAT4LS: @Alt_Codes I don't think that matters cuz people exploiting it to "Gear up" their Alt accounts who has shitty gears and its better than nothing lol
[4:27:45] Walter_White22: i
[4:27:46] Cafe0le: they are going to get much better gear the first hours of the season so it doesnt matter
[4:27:52] Nitelyter: if you have that world boss gear you're going to kill shit quicker in keys as opposed to someone with gear 10 ilvls lower, so yes, it very much does affect RWF

[4:29:10] Nitelyter: @Cafe0le All I can say is, yes, yes it does. As someone who is actively trying to qualify for MDI, it matters. If I were in a RWF guild I'd also agree it matters.

[5:30:14] 0scarino_: google the error code
[5:30:15] JgoldOmega: lightning is pretty good
[5:30:18] kazpanic: nah i got 60 hours already in this i would know lmao
[5:30:24] Cado_: @dexashmexa yeah, psykers are like the spell caster type.  Zealot priests are 2h front liners.  Ogryn are meaty tanks.  Sharpshooters are the ranged.
[5:30:30] CREEPD97: surely there isnt a health station right around the corner Clueless
[5:30:31] Rezon_Kinezon: @dexashmexa Yes me as well
[5:30:32] BlueGreek: psykers with staffs probably need to have a team with comms to be effective
[5:30:35] Srxys: @kazpanic i disagree, u dont need to suck up ammo resource and there are better staff secondary abilities tht are way better
[5:30:44] kazpanic: @Rezonite_  youre right the look sick though
[5:30:48] johnthelongdon: the hordes are really cool wish there were more of these and even bigger ones! but idk maybe later on?!
[5:30:52] JgoldOmega: psyker is the higher skill class like Sienna was
[5:30:53] Lass3liten: @lyfeofbeingk that is one of the major inspirations for the series ;D
[5:31:15] Cado_: @kazpanic The staff that shoots lightning and stuns targets is broken for higher level missions to control the enemies.
[5:31:17] JJshotty: @johnthelongdon there are as you choose harder levels. and they add more elites and harder elites. it gets nuts trust me.
[5:31:25] BlueGreek: @johnthelongdon they have mission modifiers which add a ton more hoards too
[5:31:32] marteriav: shroud they say you have to grind sooo much, is that true?
[5:31:33] kazpanic: @Srxys dont even need to shoot in this game a lot just use your power to bust their heads
[5:31:37] johnthelongdon: okay thats cool
[5:31:40] fatalsouthpaw: this game fun gents?
[5:31:48] sir_lunchalot22: @johnthelongdon ive already had a swarm through tunnels that looked like an overflood LUL
[5:31:49] Cado_: @johnthelongdon Higher levels have big packs of elites/specialists.
[5:31:56] Afancyhobo: Best 40k game so far
[5:31:59] Rezon_Kinezon: @kazpanic so when you change to the laser gun are you still able to use your other powers?
[5:32:03] CREEPD97: it stops everything damn near OMEGALUL
[5:32:08] JJshotty: @fatalvideos yes but does have performance issues

[5:32:23] Rezon_Kinezon: Hmmm @kazpanic
[5:32:26] naviz3e: you can block the dog iof you push him back with melee attack
[5:32:32] JingleBomber: Jebaited
[5:32:46] Cado_: @naviz3e block or dodge, either works
[5:32:48] johnthelongdon: are there dmg numbers you can turn on/off?
[5:33:07] Srxys: @kazpanic ive tried both brain burster and non brain burster builds, i like non brain burster on higher difficulties and just being utility since more often then not u get someone with a bolter
[5:33:10] Afancyhobo: There will probably be mods in the future for damage numbers
[5:33:15] JJshotty: @fatalvideos They are well aware of the performance issues as well, I was playing beta and they addressed it in the future fixes
[5:33:17] kazpanic: @Rezonite_  the staff is cool af though. i should just probably switch to the sharp shooter now that im maxxed for this character class
[5:33:26] Cado_: @johnthelongdon I don't think you can turn on dmg numbers, but they show numbers in the testing area if you go there.
[5:33:27] Yojambra: why no fel drake
[5:33:28] dazzumo: @johnthelongdon no but you can test in a testing room against different types of enemies

[5:34:36] h000o: @dizzyyfps there is but a lot of it is in the movement with sliding and the ranged gun combat. you're not seeing it because shroud picked a staff, which was also in VT2
[5:34:39] 1KL25: ow darktide

[6:02:46] JgoldOmega: @RockinFPS it will have expansions over the next few years like Vermintide
[6:02:46] Yxothil: @Valatraz The scriptures whisper in a small radius. You can hear them through walls
[6:02:47] Valatraz: @johnthelongdon 360hz curse
[6:02:50] creavenxxx: Apparently they make a tv series based on Eisenhorn novel

[6:05:07] Cado_: @SeriousMarine This staff is meh, the flame/lightning staves are better, imo
[6:05:14] SeriousMarine: fair enough
[6:05:15] boggbingg: @Afancyhobo that was a solo project too, the guy that made it did such a good job that he got picked up by Games Workshop to make more content for the company.

[6:25:46] Aldurwulf: I used to play the first Dawn of War on my laptop, yet the more units on the field the more lagging it gets. As playing it on PC, it runs beautiful.
[6:25:48] VeryUnkind: level 3 the mid tier it should be easy

[6:26:12] Wintyer2: <3 <3

[6:37:40] Trounzey: @shroud You crash because your ray tracing lighting is still set to high in the config files which overrule the graphic settings in game.
[6:37:45] VeryUnkind: main culprit for me was setting it from 21 to 6 in bottom of launcher
[6:37:51] Jay_Overdosed: Maybe its not your pc or the game maybe you are jsut too damn good its over heating it

[6:42:50] VeryUnkind: true
[6:42:52] Nikushaa: @shroud duelling sword is lit
[6:42:54] FoodSIoot: @turnbucklebodank Their staves are a very specific and useful tool for a team.
[6:42:56] maxHiT09: @an1mejke are u a real person?
[6:42:57] NitsuaFl: give em a good ol mind blast gachiGASM
[6:43:01] neveroom_: Darktide Pog
[6:43:03] gordinhodamotoneta: its even possible to upgrade a gun?
[6:43:03] eyecue: staff doesnt need ammo, allows your other friends more ammo in the game
[6:43:06] raisekamika: so for a Psyker, weapons are a secondary ?
[6:43:07] davelit: i mean, I wouldn't mind blasting them
[6:43:09] turnbucklebodank: @FoodSIoot ah okay. makes sense
[6:43:09] FoodSIoot: The staves do so many different things and can crowd clear and crowd control like no other.

[6:44:48] Yosuen_: @gixustrix true, 3 is a pretty big step, they should wait their 2nd perks before
[6:44:49] FoodSIoot: The only class that should focus heavily on guns is the Veteran. Zealots are melee units, and Ogryn are great support and crowd control.
[6:44:53] Yxothil: Here come the body waterfalls \o/
