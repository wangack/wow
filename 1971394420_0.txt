[1:34:46] Rygem: People hate on Cata so much. It had great 1-60 questing. Going through TBC questing was a huge step down comparatively. Cata dungeons were great, Cata zones except the water one were fantastic and very nice to quest in. It got nice graphical improvements as well.
[1:34:47] Seijuro83: SekretAznMan danHero Clap
[1:34:53] FatHalpert: meh_ninja_please Pog nice

[1:36:41] andaroo: @SekretAznMan Dragonflight has been well recieved by most - I think the positivity you are seeing post Blizzcon is because they used Dragonflight to realize they could actually listen to feedback, etc

[1:37:14] Rygem: @Gosera I did not have nostalgia for the old map. I started at cata. It felt like a well oiled machine so smooth the questing was. Very straight forward, good pacing, good area design. When I went through the portal to Outland questing felt like a drag suddenly lol.
[1:37:15] Debauchery1994: are you thinking of trying the seasons that is coming out soon?
