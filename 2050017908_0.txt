[0:02:05] prodigy_wow: I lost to the same moonkin twice, he had a really optimal opener and the main reason i lost is because he got an insta NS proc from one wrath

[0:06:12] prodigy_wow: Youre 100% right
[0:06:40] BigChoobs: did you see they updated some dungeon caster gear.. im surprised SM will be available to do, gnomer wasnt available phase 1
[0:07:09] NeVolent: Hydra dont u think Martyrdo is mandatory to fight melees at lvl 40? i mean the shield will break in 1 sec and 100% u cant cast mind spike on em
[0:07:23] snapLOUD: removing all the stam from caster gear kinda cringe
[0:07:31] BigChoobs: yea but wasnt SM going to be a raid as well? they teased that
[0:07:34] prodigy_wow: @snapLOUD There is a stam set too :o
[0:07:48] NeVolent: yea i think i wont get shadowform

[0:08:09] VersusGamesFL: some of the tailioring stuff is sick tho
[0:08:09] BigChoobs: if they make a 20 or 40 man scarlet crusade raid at 60, thatd be lit
[0:08:22] Fomse: will you be leveling as disc?
[0:08:30] BigChoobs: with a quest chain to transform corrupted ashbringer into a cleansed legendary version
[0:08:56] Forgiw: hope balance will be good at 40

[1:12:30] varatupaj: i  always spam drain mana on priests when posssible :D
[1:12:47] DeathToad007: @extirpator01 its to make sure fear isnt resisted

[1:14:39] chazburner: engi tailor or ench tailor for phase 2
[1:15:45] varatupaj: same thing for warlocks 5/5 suppression is the play

[2:05:09] prodigy_wow: Warlock is super fun and the priest skill translates well
[2:05:15] jimbonni: same bro
[2:05:22] jimbonni: broring class
[2:05:27] dreeeamyy: Hunter is alot more fun when you go chimera instead of BM rune
[2:05:43] Drunk_Mantis: no mount Melvin ovah here

[2:07:07] optik_rec0rds: because alliance starts in the middle horde has to run all the way or sync hearthstones back
[2:07:08] saund: horde are scared to go there in raid groups because of the Civilian
[2:07:13] saund: for DHK
[2:07:15] Skry667: as alli we usually do shredder then wipe horde at rune
[2:07:33] Dodie324: Druid, priest, rogue or lock for p2? I can't decide
[2:07:38] saund: there's griefers that will kill it
[2:07:42] saund: just for luls
[2:07:45] optik_rec0rds: people rather get the save 600 rep than risking to only get 200 idk
[2:08:18] cuzzourt: I think because going west you risk just getting wiped and the Ally winning and getting virtual no rep. Vs the other side two guaranteed boss kills regardless of outcome.

[2:31:38] Sinostra: how long have you been playing the lock today ?
[2:31:47] Lunaatj: @itsAthlon I think I am, yeah.
[2:32:23] Lunaatj: I don't really use the client as much these days though.
[2:32:25] Lunaatj: I'll have a look.
[2:32:33] itsAthlon: ah I see you there yes :) are you playing SoD? which server are you on?
[2:32:42] Lunaatj: Nah, not playing WoW at all these days.

[2:33:36] Sinostra: wich you don't need
[2:33:54] Sinostra: yeah, wtf
[2:34:01] Sinostra: you need master channeler yeah
[2:34:02] rns_aurelius: for levelling you just need haunt and master channeler tbh
[2:34:26] rns_aurelius: incinerate is nice while levelling but would be a pain to get on horde
[2:34:57] Sinostra: master channeler can be found in silverpine forest
[2:35:07] Sinostra: or the barrens
[2:35:12] twoxxl: they probably think youre a shaman lmao
[2:35:54] Sinostra: you can't get it yet tho
[2:35:55] Sinostra: MC
[2:36:04] Sinostra: you need to be at least level 12
[2:37:38] Sinostra: just hearth

[2:38:37] misstherese: you can easy do them too Ryan
[2:38:39] rns_aurelius: master channeler is so easy for alliance you just go to loch modan and buy a pie for like 15 silver
[2:38:44] Sinostra: you get drain life at level 14 anyways, so don't worry about MC yet
[2:39:01] Sinostra: you get fear at level 8 tho
[2:39:05] Sinostra: if you want to get that
[2:39:46] Sinostra: for now, focus on getting to lvl 10
[2:39:51] Skry667: watch out that one is Payo
[2:39:51] ephixa_fan: you can easy do them too Ryan
[2:40:15] twoxxl: Oh. Btw Hydra. I think we all Mandella effected ourselves on the swappable priest racial thing. I went back and looked at the original info and it's definitely the prayer racials, not fear ward etc
[2:40:48] JavaSkrpt: You've been Fruit of the Loom'd
[2:41:30] Sinostra: are you enjoying lock ?
[2:41:51] ephixa_fan: this is the endgame lock gameplay too
[2:41:58] ephixa_fan: Kappa
[2:42:15] twoxxl: I thought they did too, but we didnt understand what they meant at the time i think. They said it before the launch. maybe im wrong but I couldnt find them talk about swapping racials, only getting prayer traits
[2:42:15] Sinostra: @ephixa_fan more dots to press
[2:42:43] prodigy_wow: Hydra i got a Spiked Collar :O
[2:42:43] Sinostra: yeah

[2:43:18] prodigy_wow: yeah
[2:43:20] prodigy_wow: one time
[2:43:23] ama__deus: How does POM interact with 2 priests casting it in raid? @Hydramist does it just knock the other off?
[2:43:36] Sinostra: lock is getting a perma one level 30 anyways
[2:44:27] JavaSkrpt: Parkour to your death
[2:44:34] JavaSkrpt: Radical way to go
[2:44:56] rns_aurelius: for grimoires you dont need the previous rank to use them so id save some money on things like sacrifice until you can get the highest rank
[2:45:05] Sinostra: first instant dot, hell yeah !
[2:45:42] Sinostra: put agony on your bars
[2:45:56] Sinostra: and fear
[2:46:03] slartibartfurst: are the official runes out or is it still the datamined stuff?

[3:06:23] ahahathatscrazybroahaha: undead cope is crazy, you're not playing in a duel tournament, orc is just better in general pvp.
[3:07:31] twoxxl: orc is bis in sod imo, there are way more stuns overall, plus people actually play ret

[3:08:31] Blgdiesel: I'm not even gonna level before p2 cause p2 will give 50% xp buff
[3:08:31] screwu666: u will do more bfds to level up too
[3:08:38] slartibartfurst: mate i wanna main a resto shaman but how can i when priest is this good?
[3:08:58] screwu666: they promised it would be some xp, so why not also get some lewt in 30min
[3:09:05] saund: even if its good xp, im not going back on my geared chars
[3:09:09] saund: fuck BFD at this point haha
[3:09:09] jazni_23: @slartibartfurst play what you enjoy, you'll be happier
[3:09:27] screwu666: ELE Shaman: Orc vs Tauren ?
[3:09:34] screwu666: when rogues get cloak
[3:09:44] screwu666: when rogues get shadowstep, that one stun might be helpful
[3:09:48] PexLoad: you don't need to do it, i just wanted to do something with these
[3:09:55] ama__deus: If rogue gets cloak, I'll play another game instead LUL
[3:10:02] screwu666: well if they give you 1 lvl per run, everyone and their mother will run those bfds
[3:10:20] screwu666: they announced it was one of the "solutions" , we just don't know how good it will be, or will it be horrible
[3:10:32] Sinostra: i think they said a substancial amount of xp, yeah
[3:10:32] screwu666: let's see
[3:10:49] screwu666: yea, let's hope "substantial" is more than 1 brick on the bar
[3:11:06] PexLoad: yeah chat, at phase two opening don't forget to do BFD
[3:11:32] Sinostra: @PexLoad don't worry, we still need the epics
[3:11:49] screwu666: epics do'nt exist anymore
[3:11:58] screwu666: we were fooled
[3:12:00] PexLoad: DansGame the staff suck for pvp @Sinostra
[3:12:13] Sinostra: @PexLoad moar spell power
[3:12:13] saund: what do you think is ahealthy amount of gold to head into P2 with now that GDKP aren't a factor anymore
[3:12:29] PexLoad: minus stam LUL @Sinostra
[3:12:37] arthasdidnothingwr0ng: I expected more from p2 but i guess we dont know everything about it yet
[3:12:44] ama__deus: Damn, cry about the epic staff LUL
[3:12:49] Sinostra: @PexLoad i have drain life for that, the more spell power, the more healing i get
[3:12:58] screwu666: i got 100g across all 5 chars
[3:13:01] saund: how much you think that Tailoring shit wilkl cost
[3:13:05] saund: the insane helm
[3:13:20] felstavd: and now theprices on farm material is shit
[3:13:22] PexLoad: oh yeah,  warlock Kappa @Sinostra
[3:13:23] Sprovs323: quests at level 40 are gona give a lot of gold
[3:13:24] QuickfireDouble: no gdkps now either
[3:13:32] Wubsie: sitting on 160g. should be a good enough start to go in for 2 chars
[3:13:33] varatupaj: 573g here, i think i should be ok
[3:13:35] screwu666: well , i hope that my mage will help me get some gold
[3:13:38] rns_aurelius: youll get most of the tailoring mats just levelling
[3:13:42] Sinostra: i still won't take that - stam gear from gnome, tho ^^
[3:13:56] bcalicore: Cheer200 hey so i was reading that you actually die on the redemption rune what do you think about that @Hydramist
[3:14:21] PexLoad: got my bis priest after two month @Sinostra a bit slow but hey
[3:14:21] arthasdidnothingwr0ng: Isnt magic dust soulbound?
[3:14:29] bcalicore: the spell is the same spell applied
[3:14:33] bcalicore: but just anytime
[3:14:51] Sinostra: @PexLoad well played, got that juicy staff
[3:14:56] bcalicore: same because in pvp it was about to be the most toxic thing since DH release
[3:14:57] infeztedlol: You gonna play warlock in next phase?
[3:15:03] Sinostra: @Hydramist pop your pet
[3:15:18] PexLoad: nah i don't like it foe pvp @Sinostra ( as a priest )
[3:15:38] slartibartfurst: your help harm macros have changed my life
[3:15:40] Sinostra: @PexLoad are you using the wsg one ?
[3:15:48] Blgdiesel: you thin holy pala is going to be good in p2?
[3:15:50] Kyfoon: is this lock on EU?
[3:16:19] PexLoad: nope, the last boss dagger and just got the book 6 stam + spell power this morning @Sinostra
[3:17:16] Sinostra: @PexLoad i have the dagger, but not the bfd off hand
[3:17:27] rns_aurelius: demonic tactics
[3:17:30] Joe_ly: no word on any rated pvp for p2 yet is there?
[3:17:49] Fineprints: click it by the skulls you picked up
[3:17:54] rns_aurelius: itll tell you 2 things you need and you take it to where you do the voidwalker quest
[3:17:58] Fineprints: if you have the other items

[3:18:33] ihymisery: Any tier list yet? @Hydramist
[3:18:38] Cafe0le: is this his first lock ?
[3:19:39] rns_aurelius: haunt can crit and if it does you heal for more
[3:19:44] Sinostra: yes, haunt can crit
[3:19:50] Fineprints: yea haunt can crit
[3:19:58] PexLoad: can't wait to face melee as shadow with all the armor bonus shit
[3:20:00] varatupaj: i think its an ok rune for meta, you pop it and spam sp
[3:20:19] Cafe0le: haunt affli is pretty fun, sad that the new runes suck but i think they wont need new stuff KEKW
[3:20:23] SirPadfoot: Hey, do you guys know if i get ashevale buff today will i be able to repeat the quest at launch ?
[3:20:36] SirPadfoot: P2 i mean
[3:20:57] Sinostra: @varatupaj they're going all in on a crit/dodge based meta tank
[3:21:03] Sinostra: wonder how it'll do
[3:21:08] PexLoad: you will still be able to get the 1k wsg rep at p2 @SirPadfoot
[3:21:23] SirPadfoot: @PexLoad ok thx mate
[3:22:46] PexLoad: 1 time /week @SirPadfoot

[3:24:08] rns_aurelius: i used haunt incinerate on my lock from lvl 6 until i got drain life

[3:24:34] Cafe0le: PepeLaugh
[3:24:37] QuickfireDouble: redridge
[3:24:38] rns_aurelius: still redridge
[3:24:39] varatupaj: redrifge :)
[3:24:41] Sinostra: bro, time to get the voidwalker now
[3:24:44] Fineprints: both faction is from the same spot
[3:24:51] Cafe0le: you dont cast as lock anyways
[3:24:58] QuickfireDouble: u dont need it
[3:24:59] Fineprints: get summoned
[3:25:00] Plushie__Tv: Drops from Level 23 Elite Orc Incinerator Gar'im in Redridge Mountains. You can find him in a cave in the southeast of the area, around (77 85).
[3:25:00] jazni_23: this starting area is awkward
[3:25:04] Sinostra: you got a lock quest to do
[3:25:09] botch19: no
[3:25:10] QuickfireDouble: no
[3:25:13] rns_aurelius: voidwalker is useless
[3:25:14] screwu666: are you on Living Flame?
[3:25:19] uggabooga1: no imp for sure
[3:25:32] lastad94: voidwalked taunt is good
[3:25:34] Sinostra: you're doing the dam, you're not a hunter
[3:25:36] Wubsie: I mean... imp itself does more but no push back I guess, so...
[3:25:50] varatupaj: i think for lvling you just need haunt and drain life rune, its easy to get in barrens
[3:25:55] rns_aurelius: @Wubsie voidwalker wont hold aggro
[3:26:16] Sinostra: @rns_aurelius really depends on what happens
[3:26:33] Sinostra: if you dot without haunt, it'll hold it for a bit
[3:26:44] Sinostra: it's really good for multi target
[3:26:51] Steggy_730: love the IASIP name reference LUL
[3:26:54] Sinostra: holding aggro on some mobs while you multi dot
[3:26:55] QuickfireDouble: u will not dot without haunt tho
[3:27:14] Wubsie: even at 25 it *sometimes* holds aggro when I dot + incinerate
[3:27:15] mrsnacksnack: have you ever played warlock? :D
[3:27:19] Sinostra: @QuickfireDouble if you dot 3 mobs at a time, you will have to
[3:28:04] Sinostra: when's your bfd Hyra ?
[3:28:24] zaykoog: why warlock brother?
[3:28:27] Sinostra: ok, i'll have to go have dinner

[3:45:29] cockjab: you think the full darkness dmg is worth over 10% imp vamp embrace?

[3:46:41] cockjab: both are gonna scale crazy tbh
[3:46:50] Aspmann: Do you miss playing arena at all after you switched to sod fulltime? @Hydramist

[3:50:44] theEntropie: The play is NOT to jump in water when you get the bomb
[3:51:07] prodigy_wow: Whats the value in shadow focus? YWhat classes do you need it vs in world pvp?
[3:52:21] neuemeloria: Hey Hydra, I am wondering what is the addon you use for the 5sr incorporated in your player frame :)
[3:52:37] prodigy_wow: Nice to fear fel hounds?
[3:52:37] JavaSkrpt: that extra 6 duration + shared pain would crush in BGs
[3:52:42] JavaSkrpt: Lots of blanket dmg
[3:52:44] rns_aurelius: trinket will probably still be bis for a while
[3:53:03] theEntropie: Improved Vampiric Embrace any good?

[3:53:27] saund: nothing else to do atm
[3:53:28] rns_aurelius: @saund theyd do the same to you
[3:53:35] Weddzz: Hi @Hydramist :)  I've tried to figure out if mind sear procs blackout on all targets or only the one you're targetting - do you know?
[3:54:21] Weddzz: Yeah I've tried it for a long time now, only procs on my target..
[3:56:05] prodigy_wow: @Weddzz I tested it as well and it was only on the mind sear target
[3:56:11] notgarru: EZ yoink on the belt
[3:56:47] zoandrix: epic staff inc
[3:58:02] smotxzz: Hydra how to have shamans as blue color on raid frame im so triggered with pink
[3:58:09] tmilla_89: done every lockout on my priest and never seen it drop
[3:58:49] smotxzz: ty boy insta installed
[3:58:54] theEntropie: done every lockout on priest, never got it. Done 1 bfd on a mage alt in full of greens and got it
[4:00:14] bassiemon123: Were those +20 heal bracers??
[4:00:25] bassiemon123: Pheew yeee
[4:00:52] bassiemon123: Dagger/staff
[4:01:11] bassiemon123: Would be huge
[4:02:10] WaysOfDaniel: !runes
[4:02:11] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[4:02:32] bassiemon123: I still have the same gear i had 1 month aggo. Still no dagger/pants/gloves. Depressing
[4:02:47] screwu666: never seen gloves actually
[4:02:56] screwu666: doing this on 5 chars every reset
[4:03:48] screwu666: isn't it so that there are quire decent weapons next phase, epic dagger, decent offhands etc
[4:04:43] bassiemon123: I did like that they didnt make al the gear so OP that other gear isnt relevant anymore.
[4:05:29] screwu666: well the loot is already crazy, 1 mobs of lvl 25-27 go down in like 1.5 seconds
[4:05:37] screwu666: thank god
[4:05:38] saund: i just hope they change the epic 2h mace into a 2h axe from STV rep
[4:05:43] saund: or ima be pissed i have to raid
[4:06:13] screwu666: it's good that it's only for shamans :D
[4:06:18] screwu666: and not warriors and paladins
[4:06:32] saund: warriors cant use that 2h? @screwu666
[4:06:36] saund: i swear i saw they could on wowhead
[4:06:46] flackycl: !playlist
[4:06:49] bassiemon123: Hahaha get cucked @saund heroL
[4:07:11] prodigy_wow: T_T
[4:07:12] MxKV__: WOOP
[4:07:15] theEntropie: Why don't you stand behind geilhast?
[4:07:25] Plushie__Tv: i had a druid decursing everyone and due to some strange overlaps, had 4 feared at once its like dafuq stop
[4:07:32] Cupz21: no brez?
[4:07:58] theEntropie: If you stay in the roots behind him, the entire mechanic gets cheesed
[4:07:58] bassiemon123: And there it is
[4:08:05] bassiemon123: hydraPog
[4:08:10] Nonotion: No one decursed you, starting from p2 you get feared even if the timer runs out
[4:08:21] screwu666: @saund it's a shaman reward

[4:08:36] tilta1337: you think the epic spildersilk boots gonna be easy to replace in lvl 40 ?
[4:08:41] Nonotion: So theoretically you'd want to decurse before the murloc phase
[4:08:59] bassiemon123: @tilta1337 on use effect to crazy
[4:09:21] abusive_johnny: its raid geared streamer?
[4:09:25] saund: @saund so warriors only get a one hander? the fuck is that BS
[4:09:34] saund: dont be livid you got 2 set for p2 Hydra!
[4:09:53] saund: took me 9 weeks to get that robe LuL
[4:10:05] SohnEinerHupe: u saw that leaked shaman 2h weapon :O
[4:10:12] bassiemon123: Btw pritty funny the hardest hitting weapon for phase 2 is a staff xd
[4:10:27] bassiemon123: Its a need angle
[4:11:10] Plushie__Tv: Randle looking slick
[4:11:43] saund: we are talking about this right? @bassiemon123 https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=216495/sanguine-crusher
[4:11:57] saund: get it for rune swap
[4:12:53] Grinam: put a rune on your new chest
[4:13:30] notgarru: cant even path to the jump w/o boon Sadge
[4:13:36] bassiemon123: Ooohh no was talking about the shaman one @saund
[4:13:40] bassiemon123: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=216502/bloodstorm-war-totem
[4:13:44] DeathToad007: he is a troll
[4:13:52] ihymisery: Feeling pretty discouraged to play rogue rn and im not sure the Rune in P2 will fix it. Any recommendations that are currently fun and have legitimate longevity, unlike gimmicky classes like hunters serpent @Hydramist
[4:13:54] DeathToad007: checks out
[4:14:04] saund: holy shit might have to make shammy for this @bassiemon123
[4:14:10] bassiemon123: Ye its nutty
[4:14:11] saund: but i beg they change the war into an axe omg
[4:14:37] bassiemon123: Yeee feels bad for all orcs
[4:14:55] saund: nah man even for taurens like me @bassiemon123
[4:15:02] saund: axe spec necessary for crit
[4:15:37] depe485: will they have enough dmg though?
[4:15:41] bassiemon123: Aaahh kay, havent touched warrior at all. Makes sense
[4:15:51] twoxxl: rogues going to be reallly strong at 40
[4:16:35] depe485: i feel like the 1h weaps are not that impressive in comparison to 2h
[4:16:35] zNELLY: Which class do you think will be the strongest in open world pvp?
[4:17:20] twitchara7: what race is better for pvp troll or undeath for priest
[4:17:38] venemx10: ele sham?
[4:17:40] bassiemon123: GoldPLZ
[4:17:46] ihymisery: holy fucking ads- - - flat 10% damage buff from master of sub isnt that much. shadow step is good, but waylay ?which gets nullified by having crippling poison if you cant stay on target with 70% slow then rogue isnt for you. whats so broken about sub? cheap prep kidney, its the standard rogue toolkit. the raid loot is underwhelming for rogue esp. daggers for ambush etc. am i trippin??????? @Hydramist
[4:17:48] JavaSkrpt: Lord please provide this man a big stick
[4:18:06] rafak_1: for world pvp rogue is always bis.. just wait the ennemy is pixel before engaging
[4:18:28] bassiemon123: @javaskrpt we talking bout the staff right?
[4:18:35] prodigy_wow: i think p2 the world pvp tier list looks about the same. Mage gets better though
[4:18:43] EpShade: @ihymisery you are in fact tripping
[4:18:43] SoloKwt: how is ur shaman mate blue in raidframe?
[4:19:03] saund: apparently dungeon loot in SM and RFK is getting buffed, datamine @Hydramist
[4:19:07] JavaSkrpt: @bassiemon123 ofc
[4:19:08] saund: so good for catch up
[4:20:43] ama__deus: Soul leech on next 🙏
[4:21:09] rns_aurelius: needed to happen tbh
[4:22:05] ama__deus: Didn't even see either pants drop on my priest the entire phase
[4:22:15] bassiemon123: LUL
[4:22:58] ama__deus: I saw them, but across multiple characters. Just not on the one I need them on KEKW
[4:23:05] rns_aurelius: i have 9 characters and have never seen the staff
[4:23:17] bmkJR: ive seen no epics drop ever
[4:23:23] ama__deus: Saw staff 6 x, but never got it Sadge

[4:26:30] ama__deus: I'm glad they didn't ban me for pearl diving early on Pepepains
[4:26:35] Plushie__Tv: oh do horde not get a NPC to port them at the end? :O
[4:26:44] Plushie__Tv: Alliance get a port to Darna
[4:26:44] mokabear: That made me sad
[4:26:53] mokabear: and then he's like "I don't need to play my hunter now"
[4:26:58] saund: better weapon from STV soon mate <3 @mokabear
[4:26:59] Schwabx: ah
[4:27:00] mokabear: WHY GET THE BOW TO NOT PLAY YOUR HUNTER? wtf

[4:29:42] mokabear: Er
[4:29:45] mokabear: My lock is like lvl 18?
[4:29:46] screwu666: what server are you on that lock?
[4:29:55] mokabear: lock 18, warrior 21
[4:29:59] mokabear: But I'm not playing rn
[4:31:22] Feadshy: Sorry for noob question: On Character Overview i can only see attackpower for melee and ranged. How can i see Spelldmg and heal?
[4:31:24] AsenKovachev: is it fun to play mage for pvp?
[4:31:51] Feadshy: Cool thanks. Shame that is isnt default.
[4:32:10] unclegary1337: Thoughts on WSG farm all day Thursday?

[4:32:34] saund: can't you get the shoulders from the quest on Randle?
[4:32:40] unclegary1337: 5 wins an hour for 12 hours
[4:32:41] saund: Frayed Chestnut
[4:32:48] unclegary1337: max
[4:32:50] mokabear: @saund implying he does anything to earn his gear
[4:32:51] unclegary1337: think it works out like 2 levels
[4:32:53] unclegary1337: 2-2.5
[4:33:05] Techietv: Heyo @Hydramist
[4:33:11] saund: KEKWait  @mokabear
[4:36:22] kevinrmp: have you ever felt jelous of other classes mobility/cc?
[4:36:26] Slyxen: heavy stone
[4:36:40] unclegary1337: idk whats the time
[4:36:45] unclegary1337: like 8/9 mins if its instant pop?
[4:36:48] hot5and7: hot5and7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! no more gdkp!
[4:36:58] rns_aurelius: does anyone know if dual wield rune is worth for enhance idk if i wanna dump the money on it
[4:37:05] vodkamamont: !server
[4:37:05] Nightbot: Living Flame Horde EU / Crusader Strike Horde US
[4:37:30] Slyxen: @rns_aurelius after seeing that 2h rune.. no. i'll be switching LUL
[4:37:30] unclegary1337: tbf think the math works out more like 2 bars for 5 wins so probably about 50 wins for a level
[4:37:48] unclegary1337: could be less
[4:37:48] rns_aurelius: mop is when mobility really went crazy

[4:38:35] Goated_Goods: Oh yeah, sorry came in late :)
[4:38:35] kevinrmp: imo rogues should be S tier mobility, so i dont mind step
[4:39:18] kevinrmp: do they get the step that costs 20 energy?
[4:39:40] ama__deus: I just want PVE shadow not to completely suck next phase
[4:39:44] triggy25: i think its no cost
[4:39:59] kevinrmp: half wotlk, half tbc version of step then
[4:42:38] theEntropie: no it's like 0.5%
[4:42:39] tmilla_89: i dont mind PVE healing as long as i can PVP shadow
[4:42:47] theEntropie: Atlas loot number are borked
[4:43:00] rns_aurelius: it doesnt for bfd i think
[4:43:16] fakemejo: is this priest going full shadow? prayge

[4:45:54] grievousww: yea there all at shredded
[4:46:57] kevinrmp: i think so yeh
[4:47:25] kevinrmp: but if its way less pvp (such as on pve servers etc) then the percentages becomes ie 5% per kill
[4:48:16] fakemejo: why don't u have bagnon?
[4:49:05] grievousww: u prequesting also?
[4:50:15] fakemejo: btw any necessary runes to grab in p1 as shadow priest?
[4:50:49] fakemejo: got 4
[4:50:57] fakemejo: but aight
[4:51:34] xProloli: mind sear for the aoe farm sm runs

[4:52:31] fakemejo: holy shit, thats gonna be siick
[4:52:45] theEntropie: mind sear hits like a truck
[4:53:07] theEntropie: nope

[4:53:40] theEntropie: tbh, throwing 4 shared pains while waiting for tank to get aggro and the mind searing
[4:53:43] lemarky_: feels like SPriest will be on the menu
[4:54:14] theEntropie: It seems to re-apply
[4:54:20] kromjsi: @Hydramist your Title, the new wowhead phase2 rune list wasnt confirmed yet?
[4:54:53] Plushie__Tv: Lone Wolf alliance is always so slow
[4:55:14] kromjsi: ah.. cause i really wanted deepfreeze on my mage but cba level it to 25 if we wont get it lmao
[4:55:36] Grinam: from which addon are those raid frames
[4:55:49] Slyxen: @Grinam not an addon
[4:55:53] theEntropie: these are default raid frames
[4:56:04] Grinam: oh ok
[4:56:42] svakkaN: Who are you playing with on LW?
[4:57:42] Kiwaia: hi! hows Kiki? :)
[4:58:16] svakkaN: Horde on LW is something else. Dont think ive won a single battle KEKW
[4:58:17] tilta1337: horde never wins on lone wolf :P
[4:59:38] svakkaN: are ya excited for PS / dispersion & fiend?
[4:59:51] ama__deus: @Hydramist where do you get your stat weights for sites like sixty upgrade etc?
[5:00:40] ama__deus: That does not seem scientific 🤓
[5:01:52] sunrisepartyx: !runes
[5:01:52] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[5:02:32] mylittlehombre: there’s a holy talent that gives a percentage of spirit to spell power
[5:04:38] svakkaN: lowkey I thought they were gonna add actual new abilities / passives. But alot of the "new" is basically wrath at 40
[5:05:00] chrizzo1988: what trinket is this on shift+r
[5:05:53] svakkaN: I dislike that they're adding displacement & shadowstep, granted displacement is for a later phase but still if its true
[5:06:09] bisonkron: new pvp trinkets for P2 it looks like
[5:06:43] ImJns: 2min remove all trinket would be so guud
[5:07:04] wowjunkie94: Do we get the Dmg reduction rune from shadow word death this coming phase ?
[5:07:21] kevinrmp: @wowjunkie94 no
[5:07:29] wowjunkie94: yea
[5:07:33] ImJns: rogue one is shit :D
[5:07:37] wowjunkie94: ty @kevinrmp

[5:07:50] Rugmouse: orc racial seems so much better with the trinket change

[5:09:24] lund19: Cant decide between lock rogue priest or mage :c
[5:09:30] kevinrmp: shadow looks like they get cucked by priests and palas. no dispel protection
[5:09:45] kevinrmp: for next phase i mean
[5:09:53] svakkaN: pala get dispel at 42 I think
[5:09:57] kevinrmp: oww
[5:10:02] kevinrmp: thought it was 32
[5:10:13] lund19: Mage with deepfreeze seems crazy

[5:11:13] nephcs: should do a little tag group if you want to speedrun rep
[5:11:25] svakkaN: Im actually more worried that they add mobility stuff to vanilla
[5:11:26] ImJns: STV will be chaotic aids
[5:11:27] lund19: Troll over undead?
[5:11:54] screwu666: is shadowstrike and shadowstep reserved?
[5:12:05] lund19: @svakkaN i wonder how war matchups will be as ranged
[5:12:16] svakkaN: rogue has 2 gapclosers now with step being added, and the arcane blink 24times in a row rune
[5:12:19] screwu666: i think they are walking borderline on mobility
[5:12:45] screwu666: i thought shadowstrike was fair
[5:12:50] screwu666: but shstep is weird
[5:12:52] tpm_manny: By the way , I saw before someone asking you to go farm WSG marks on the 7th or whatever. won't work mate, they already said they will purge everything
[5:12:58] kevinrmp: shadowstrike does feel a bit pvp specific for like vanish shadowstrike kick
[5:13:04] lund19: I cant wait for gnome rogues to racial frost nova and shadowstep stun or shadowstep kick
[5:13:12] screwu666: one of them is not gonna make it
[5:13:13] screwu666: hahaha
[5:13:16] Noitheknight333: is it confirmed?
[5:13:30] screwu666: i'd say shadowstep is not gonna  make it to the game
[5:13:34] ImJns: 6 sec cd 8 mana cost 300 dmg nuke is also questionable
[5:13:45] screwu666: majority of people are parsers, and u don't need shstep to parse anyways
[5:13:47] lund19: will be crazy at 40 with shadowstrike and shadowstep with prep 2x vanish xd
[5:13:51] lund19: legit cant get away as a caster
[5:14:16] screwu666: i hope world buff is not going to give movespeed
[5:14:24] svakkaN: I think warriors will be pretty good. Intervene will probably synergize with warbringer aswell
[5:15:03] tpm_manny: Were you using holy nova on randle? Do you raid as holy?
[5:15:26] tpm_manny: Ah, I saw the Keybind, was  confused :P
[5:15:31] kevinrmp: intercept+charge+intervene+warbringer = warrior has more mobility than rogue (doesnt feel right)
[5:16:41] screwu666: yep
[5:16:43] lund19: I am considering trying fire mage with deepfreeze
[5:17:06] svakkaN: as soon as I saw deepfreeze + hotstreak I was thinking mop mage instantly lol
[5:17:36] lund19: nova -> poly -> fireball -> deep -> fireball + pyro with shatter
[5:17:50] kevinrmp: @svakkaN yeh same. too bad we cant pull of those mop fire mage combos without alter time + pom
[5:17:54] lund19: seems kinda shit if they trinket tho xD
[5:18:07] lund19: wait isnt deepfreeze at 40?
[5:18:12] svakkaN: nah DF at 50
[5:18:16] lund19: F
[5:18:38] svakkaN: but theyre getting hotstreak most likely, + shatter obv and 50% crit dmg LUL
[5:18:40] lund19: Idk if i wanna play mage next phase then xD
[5:19:03] lund19: Destro lock could be fun aswell tho
[5:19:03] screwu666: think my mage will just sponsor my other character professions next phase
[5:19:24] svakkaN: I think lock overall will suck until level 50
[5:19:32] screwu666: :(
[5:19:46] lund19: oh yeah ele
[5:19:51] lund19: big 1 shots pog
[5:19:59] screwu666: what ele u gonna do, orc or tauren?
[5:20:15] screwu666: i decided to have both :S
[5:20:15] lund19: orc for the full send 1 shots
[5:20:16] kevinrmp: tauren for sure
[5:20:20] Yesnig: 1:1 is 10% dmg ?
[5:20:34] varatupaj: i feel lock will have trouble surviving unless you play something like sl meta, but dmg will be meh
[5:20:40] svakkaN: Tauren, more stam & stomp clutch
[5:20:45] OroJackson84: !runesout
[5:20:47] SohnEinerHupe: body type?
[5:21:08] screwu666: maybe orc is more of an enhancement shaman if there will be a good axe
[5:21:13] robocoptitletheme: !runes
[5:21:13] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[5:21:17] kevinrmp: big beefy milkable bull ofc
[5:21:28] lund19: I wonder how ret will be with 40 yard judgement
[5:21:28] screwu666: altho 25% stun resist is also good
[5:21:31] screwu666: it is easy
[5:21:43] svakkaN: U get all the tanking runes from lvl 1 basically, heard its a breeze to level
[5:21:49] screwu666: u get lava lash, mainhand something, offhand u get dagger and u dual weild
[5:21:55] screwu666: everything dies fast with lava lash
[5:22:03] gravless2k: !server

[5:22:10] screwu666: but that's at lvl 10ish
[5:23:03] lund19: I got a feeling rogue will be the best class next phase for world pvp
[5:23:03] screwu666: sucks that my orc shaman is half way to exalted with wsg
[5:23:05] lund19: at least 1 vs 1
[5:23:10] screwu666: and my tauren shaman is only lvl 13

[5:24:05] Kiwifruits: orc shaman is insane with blood fury/double rock biter for shamanistic rage you legit can get over 100 mana per tick as a caster it’s insane. orc is bis
[5:24:13] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[5:24:23] mysticelderr: when phase 2 will be up ?
[5:24:49] screwu666: @Kiwifruits true
[5:25:17] screwu666: u don't need to melee to get mana back
[5:25:25] rns_aurelius: you dont need to melee with sham rage
[5:25:35] rns_aurelius: its just a mini evocate
[5:25:36] screwu666: u only need to have more AP than SP to trigger the largest mana
[5:25:40] screwu666: yes
[5:25:43] mysticelderr: when phase 2 will be up ?
[5:26:05] mysticelderr: ahh dint hear
[5:26:07] screwu666: wall + mana regen
[5:26:12] lund19: Thoughts on strongest class next phase? for 1vs1
[5:26:32] screwu666: i would hope it is, but warstomp is also good
[5:26:40] kevinrmp: im seeing tauren as 100% the play if elem
[5:26:41] Empire_OCE: Ive main shaman ele for years in classic ORC is hands down the play for pvp
[5:26:44] Kiwifruits: overall utility orc is better I think
[5:26:53] screwu666: i'll just have both
[5:26:54] Empire_OCE: The stun locks on rogues is what hurts you on shamans
[5:27:02] screwu666: the tauren with mace stun is RP
[5:27:06] screwu666: warchief
[5:27:31] Empire_OCE: HoJ and Stunlocks are more often not impactful on you
[5:27:57] cyanne112: asa ele tauren is often the only way to get your dmg out
[5:28:04] cyanne112: as*
[5:28:31] fourkgaming: @cyanne112 invis pot works great for that
[5:28:32] akakievichx: S tier for P2?
[5:29:01] screwu666: just level both
[5:29:03] screwu666: fuck it
[5:29:20] Empire_OCE: Its not a choice, lol every tauren in pvp after a while (thats not a healer) wants to switch to orc
[5:29:23] screwu666: u def don't need a lock on lvl 40
[5:29:26] screwu666: so u can level that with p2
[5:30:10] Kiwifruits: I think decoy totem will give orc shamans the space they need to cast and kite if it’s a actual buff and not only the totem giving freedom
[5:31:05] screwu666: i hope we can let out a cast vs a warrior
[5:31:33] lund19: Does lava burst do big dam?
[5:31:40] kevinrmp: no spell pusback untill you have gotten critten tho
[5:31:46] screwu666: i second that we will live as long
[5:31:48] screwu666: but i hope so
[5:31:51] Kiwifruits: yeah for sure itl interesting tho if you can use it on a charge etc is kinda nuts plus grounding
[5:32:07] ama__deus: Too bad that new helmet that's basically aura mastery, is plate LUL mail would rock for ele
[5:32:47] nizule: trolllll
[5:32:52] Waterwalk: at least it will be easy in p2
[5:32:55] Waterwalk: since 50% xp gain
[5:33:01] scroteyx: male tauren op
[5:33:13] Waterwalk: y but from 25 i carry ou on living flame abit:P
[5:33:18] Waterwalk: xd

[6:02:07] ratpapii: taco bell never loved you - you just enjoy meat
[6:02:17] zi0qt: Warlock runes are dogtier @Sinostra
[6:02:41] lund19: Can shaman deal with warriors tho?
[6:02:45] lund19: in open world
[6:02:45] Sinostra: @zi0qt doesn't mean lock will be bad
[6:02:56] lund19: thinking about how shit will go down in STV
[6:03:24] foxisnotgod: staff always
[6:03:25] Labelblack2723: what about shadow priest? will be good next phase?
[6:03:26] kevinrmp: for now, just take what has most dps
[6:03:38] screwu666: sure, go staff until u get dual wield
[6:03:40] rns_aurelius: go to tb at 10 to get dual wield
[6:03:52] BoyeTV: so u think ele shaman will dominate battlegrounds?
[6:04:00] nizule: everything is S tier next phase
[6:04:10] screwu666: dominate battlegrounds until ele gets charged
[6:04:12] screwu666: then not so much
[6:04:20] screwu666: or shadowstepped
[6:04:26] screwu666: ye i wonder how the freedom totem would work
[6:04:28] codelean: Disc/Holy priest on wow since the beginning of time. I mostly play arena but sometimes other content (if you're lucky)
[6:04:43] codelean: we are lucky 24/7 now :)
[6:04:49] codelean: yes
[6:05:34] codelean: ive been play a little bit of retail and its so cooked. getting back into the game is impossible. have to reasearch for a year only to setup omnibar KEKW

[6:05:54] Rutzou: !runes
[6:05:54] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skMbDAM0Crs
[6:07:34] BoyeTV: did u answer my question about the ele shaman dominating in p2?
[6:07:42] screwu666: retail is like, the dipshit is flying left and right, then forward and backwards, sparkles from his eyes - you die
[6:07:46] BoyeTV: will they dominate
[6:08:00] codelean: @screwu666 yes KEKW
[6:08:06] lund19: What about mages next phase? :thinking:
[6:08:12] lund19: Will they do big dam
[6:08:16] codelean: but it fixes my arena itch, and tbh its trash but still better than wrath arena

[6:13:13] kevinrmp: @lund19 whichever class u like the fantasy/aesthetic the most of
[6:13:13] phailix: @lund19 what's the answer?
[6:14:15] Sinostra: how do your fingers reach 7 on your keyboard ?
[6:14:20] phailix: Priests S tier in p2 ofc
[6:14:24] zajdeki: gonna play ele or resto ?
[6:14:30] foxisnotgod: yes
[6:14:32] lund19: But
[6:14:33] foxisnotgod: its for earth totem
[6:14:36] lund19: Does shadow do big dam tho?
[6:14:43] foxisnotgod: no have to do it here
[6:14:52] phailix: Imagine the nightmare of playing vs hunter trap with trap launch if they have the surv snare talent...
[6:14:54] lund19: I either wanna chain cc people till they die or do funny 1 shots
[6:14:54] phailix: ouf
[6:14:55] rns_aurelius: the water one is a trek
[6:15:00] nizule: you love that damage @lund19
[6:15:09] foxisnotgod: water one isn't worth doing, i did it at 60
[6:15:22] scroteyx: go south
[6:16:02] scroteyx: yeah
[6:16:31] lund19: Wow is all about the big dam
[6:17:27] JavaSkrpt: I'm gonna cry, these tunes so sweet
[6:17:57] nizule: its the one from the lightning
[6:18:00] nizule: here in durotar
[6:18:06] rupturepro: lava lash, it gives u dw also
[6:18:13] nizule: random lightning strikes drop a lootable totem
[6:18:44] Drunk_Mantis: there's also the fallen soldier in the centaur area
[6:18:49] Drunk_Mantis: that y ou need to heal/rez or something
[6:18:58] nizule: yeah, that too. same as priest
[6:18:59] Drunk_Mantis: which gives ancestral guidance
[6:19:01] nizule: need other healers
[6:19:11] kevinrmp: anscestral guidance
[6:19:17] rns_aurelius: it's not that good tbh
[6:19:46] nizule: restohance rune p2
[6:19:51] Snurn: !shaman
[6:20:04] foxisnotgod: get carried for lavaburst and shamanistic rage
[6:20:23] Mystylerocks: in the shammy living flame or lone w
[6:20:28] nizule: burst isn’t that good while leveling tbh
[6:20:47] letho_og: why rerollin sham?
[6:20:59] letho_og: whos gonna be our priest guide
[6:21:01] xDropperd: What put you over the edge for rerolling Shaman?
[6:21:04] Mystylerocks: the ambience is real!
[6:21:12] letho_og: hahahahaha
[6:21:51] nizule: leveling is more bolt for pulling and then lava lash in melee range to finish. Quite efficient
[6:21:51] cavi_tv: Why the swap?
[6:22:13] nizule: rather than waiting on burst after a flame shock. too clunky
[6:22:34] Khyltv: i'm late to the party - are u actually rerolling bro?
[6:23:19] Mystylerocks: to be fair i found that the most efficient for exp and almost 0 downtime when i was lvling msr was legs way of earth for double shock, chest with rune of shield for mana returns and lava blast on hands for 1v2/3 situations

[6:23:49] nizule: I did way of earth and dual wield lava lash
[6:23:57] Mystylerocks: no i mean the cone frontal
[6:24:09] UnsafeCell: is this the BIS class in p2?
[6:24:11] nizule: bolt > lash > double shock, swap to shamanistic rage out of combat
[6:24:11] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[6:24:21] Mystylerocks: i didnt have access to burst in release it wasnt discovered that fast :D
[6:24:50] nizule: you’re in the ancestral guidance area
[6:24:53] Mystylerocks: way of earth was durotar for sure
[6:24:55] subj9: there isnt much tbh
[6:25:01] Mystylerocks: ancestral guidance is monka never used that
[6:25:09] Mystylerocks: but if u re there u might as well get it
[6:25:10] abusive_johnny: @Hydramist shamans bad runes rly , not same like dru or priest for good lvling
[6:25:13] Drunk_Mantis: shield mastery is in durotar
[6:25:33] Mystylerocks: i would go 100% shield mastery and way of earth
[6:25:34] Drunk_Mantis: way of earth is barrens pretty sure, need level 14 to purge the mirage
[6:25:46] xDropperd: Lava Burst is Gnolls in Hillsbrad, you will need to be boosted if you want that early
[6:25:50] kevinrmp: mop vamp embrace
[6:25:53] Mystylerocks: some1 else can purge for him i guess
[6:26:28] xDropperd: Way of Earth, Dual Wield, Lava Lash is easier to get
[6:26:33] nizule: yep
[6:26:39] lund19: I wonder how enhance will be with stormstrike and windfury
[6:26:46] Viwia: what server is this?
[6:27:15] foxisnotgod: dualwield you train in tb
[6:27:21] rupturepro: in TB, u can solo it at lvl 8
[6:27:22] screwu666: dual wield and lavalash are in Thunderbluff
[6:27:23] Mystylerocks: im coming on my mage to get the molten blast one, its close to you
[6:27:26] Drunk_Mantis: quest chain from TB for dual wield
[6:27:30] xDropperd: Shamanistic Rage is from the Harpies area in Stonetalon, also req' carry
[6:28:12] hiixmaple: RiP

[6:29:39] moarpwp: even it is good 0 fun
[6:29:46] shredder1111: i was just killing lions and got phased to a layer where they were all dead wtf
[6:29:56] Sinostra: and what lock gets from talents and levels is not bad
[6:30:14] lund19: I wonder if level 60 will be same raids as usual
[6:30:22] Mystylerocks: bruh, yday i was layered randomly while doing 1k needles escort, not a pleasant experience
[6:30:27] moarpwp: Hydra reroll is joke right?
[6:31:02] dreeeamyy: @moarpwp he is rerolling hunter
[6:31:23] moarpwp: confusion at highest :D
[6:31:27] Sinostra: Hydra's rerolling 2H enh

[6:33:08] nizule: up to you, it shares with shield mastery and lava lash
[6:33:16] nizule: its a hut
[6:33:31] nizule: you need others to blast the mob with fire spells
[6:33:39] nizule: since you don’t have any

[6:39:25] loader1990: is shaman going to be good phase 2?
[6:39:34] BoyeTV: you need sombody to get u lave burst for lvling, its amazing
[6:40:00] xDropperd: no war stomp angle?
[6:40:05] foxisnotgod: need to kill level 27 mobs for lavaburst
[6:40:45] kungah: would head to TB and do the lava lash+dualwield when u hit 10'ish, pretty gd
[6:41:08] xDropperd: Same for Shamanistic Rage
[6:41:09] UnsafeCell: why reroll shaman?
[6:41:13] xDropperd: Blast is Aoe
[6:41:21] nizule: blast is aoe tanking
[6:41:23] Mystylerocks: molten blast is cone aoe that hits up to 4
[6:41:33] kungah: its your offhand, so u get a slow OH, has low mana cost
[6:41:39] Mystylerocks: which is a nice pair up with killing 2-3 mobs with shield rune
[6:41:44] Mystylerocks: assuming the mobs r melee
[6:41:50] xDropperd: Lava Lash cost 2-10 mana
[6:41:51] Mystylerocks: ez block stacks and infinite mana
[6:42:01] minnnd: lavalash mana cost is lower like 1-4 mana per cast
[6:42:02] ama__deus: why do statweights not work on molten blast FeelsThinkingMan
[6:42:02] foxisnotgod: at your level, lavaburst practicaly 1 shots even without crit
[6:42:11] nizule: hydra’s overloaded with info
[6:42:14] jgagel1: is this a meme?
[6:42:31] xDropperd: Would love to see LB during lvling
[6:42:54] jgagel1: is my ele sham gunna be this strong phase 2??!
[6:42:56] ama__deus: don't have a character on that server, but if someone can get you to Tarren's Mill, it's 5 minutes of "work" to get the rune
[6:43:19] ama__deus: Need a high level to kill some mobs for you, though
[6:43:26] Viwia: what server is this?
[6:43:26] nizule: still need to jump in lava too
[6:43:32] nizule: for burst
[6:43:33] MiddyG: lb requires killing lvl 27 mobs for a drop.. so you still need help at tm.. then u can go to RFC and do the next part easy
[6:44:02] xDropperd: RFC Lava is the lowest dmg right?
[6:44:09] Sinostra: it's fine, Hydra can pay 2g to get summoned to taren mill, right ?
[6:44:24] typhunreal1: why are you rerolling Hydra?
[6:44:42] xDropperd: EU Living Flame?

[6:46:26] Noitheknight333: i wonder if itll compare to starsurge while leveling
[6:46:29] googlewooglex: What server are your human Romeyo on mate, Lonewolf?
[6:46:38] nizule: starsurge is so much better
[6:46:48] nizule: for leveling

[7:23:30] ama__deus: sucks that water shield and lava burst are on the same slot
[7:23:31] Mystylerocks: if u plan to play shield mastery melee attacks and double shocking u go way
[7:24:08] MachoGG: you playing resto?
[7:24:22] MachoGG: or ele
[7:24:33] Mystylerocks: yea, and if u learn dual wielding from thunder bluff rune and use double rockbiter the gains from sham rage are so huge
[7:24:50] nizule: yeah, sham rage has wide variance, even at 25
[7:24:59] nizule: need weapon swap macro to get full usage.
[7:25:41] MachoGG: i wish they introduced dual spec
[7:26:07] Mystylerocks: take fp
[7:26:27] nizule: can’t even get earth shield until baron aquanis

[7:26:32] MachoGG: what spec is hydra playing at max level for shaman
[7:26:48] sumprt: You play ele or enh in p2?
[7:27:39] nizule: org closer than crossroads

[7:28:26] Mystylerocks: green fatso ones
[7:29:02] Mystylerocks: there are 2 runes here.. 1 is water shield which is GIGA cancerous dropchance

[7:29:24] MiddyG: the mob u want for rune can be at bottom near next zone entrance or to the left
[7:29:36] Dolphinwithfeet: what made you want to go sham? sorry if this has been asked a lot
[7:30:07] nizule: still think they are going to be glass cannons without Ns
[7:30:12] MiddyG: yes
[7:30:18] HelluvaWrecks: Im leveling one just so i can finally have a tuaren with a totem weapon like 13 year old me always wanted
[7:30:21] nizule: with the burst from other classes
[7:30:26] Sinostra: Hydra only wants to play what's OP D:
[7:31:13] Lunaatj: Nah even on your level 8 alt you have broken gear.

[7:32:52] t0nger1: do you think ele will be viable for raiding?
[7:33:18] 23rhz: hydra multilate 40energy change any good or still BS + shadowstrike?
[7:33:27] t0nger1: but why they are so far behind now?
[7:34:08] 23rhz: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/additional-class-tuning-in-phase-2-ptr-datamining-season-of-discovery-337505
[7:34:13] 23rhz: under rogue changes
[7:34:25] 23rhz: there are alot of known changes, but that was new to me
[7:34:48] 23rhz: not sure if its worth it, as u have to give up shadowstrike as gapcloser
[7:35:44] 23rhz: u still need it
[7:36:03] 23rhz: still handy with vanish
[7:36:09] xDropperd: It spawns / paths next to the Desolace entrance area
[7:36:33] pw_scyld: The wowhead article has some weird wording about Shadowform reducing mana cost of shadow spells. Not sure how to interpret that
[7:36:43] pw_scyld: because that would be sweet!

[7:38:32] VLLN: So sad all my friends and i rolled ally for sod i wanna play shaman so bad
[7:38:32] 23rhz: Refreshing Corruption, Immolate, Curse of Agony, or Siphon Life when it has less than 6 seconds duration remaining will cause you to deal instant damage to the target equal to one period of that spell's periodic damage.the spell's remaining periodic damage.
[7:38:35] pw_scyld: it says -50 and "flat", but the text above it says 0%, so do we get -50 mana cost or -50%? I guess we'll see
[7:38:38] 23rhz: warlock gets buffed too
[7:38:42] Noitheknight333: honestly you dont need water shield. these three runes and youll be cruising
[7:38:55] Noitheknight333: plus you cant use watershield till level 20 anyway
[7:38:55] nizule: pretty much
[7:39:03] notJumu: yea these 3 are the ones u want for now
[7:39:11] nizule: can cruise
[7:39:13] notJumu: way of earth is handy too for pvp
[7:40:05] Bojanglez: wrong way
[7:40:06] cockjab: you missed the right turn i think
[7:40:10] varaipad: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/ru/news/additional-class-tuning-in-phase-2-ptr-datamining-season-of-discovery-337505
[7:40:14] Bojanglez: left

[7:42:00] Kyfoon: just had a 55 min ashenvale event on living flame

[7:42:13] Kyfoon: great fun tbh defending lumber boss
[7:42:38] Kyfoon: yeah exactly
[7:43:00] amherian001: why shaman p2?
[7:43:45] nizule: i would still get lava lash for duel wield raging
[7:43:56] cockjab: can you read that tooltip rq?
[7:43:58] nizule: double mana back
[7:44:03] Noitheknight333: its a quest. but bleh
[7:44:07] RedlightsTV: cant remember it tbh

[7:56:44] Fnyyf: Demo locks might be good for spining flags in AB
[7:56:57] Nizzftw: too much hard casting as arcane
[7:57:02] Nizzftw: frost will be better surely
[7:57:03] Dakkroth: ele just gets giga fucked by dispels and mobility compared to a mage imo

[7:58:22] htvizzle: 230 sp ele with 1.8 sec bolts + insta lava burst
[7:58:22] t1shy: ret doesn’t get much at lvl 40 why so high?
[7:58:44] aBradAbroad: sub rogue dumpster class?
[7:59:01] Dakkroth: I didnt rate many dps specs above them to  be fair
[7:59:07] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[7:59:34] Alori_: Test
[7:59:34] Dakkroth: I think mages locks and rogues will be biggest winners for level 50 tho
[7:59:34] Nizzftw: I wouldn’t put frost the lowest mage spec
[7:59:42] moarpwp: why shadow is so high
[7:59:49] aBradAbroad: ok good
[7:59:54] letho_og: is this 1v1s?
[8:00:00] aBradAbroad: was worried lotta people rating them low and lot of rogues whining about next phase
[8:00:07] notJumu: the pvp trinket change would nerf rogs in pvp
[8:00:12] abatement454: !talents
[8:00:12] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8

[8:01:59] yeahboimp4s: shouldnt enhanc have wheel chair pic aslo
[8:02:00] AppleJaxZzz: he didnt make the list this is someone elses
[8:02:02] dogsenses: can you explain why warlock is so bad?
[8:02:16] Dakkroth: I think shams in general in the hands of a rly good player can excell big time, but on a general level they will be mid tier next phase
[8:02:21] typhunreal1: s+? as in very scary?
[8:02:34] notJumu: u can run way as enh with maelstrom but then u get less procs cause u arent using double wf
[8:03:15] HelluvaWrecks: if they know how to use their totems theyre tough
[8:03:29] makuto_gaming: where you have arcane listed, is that specced with heals in mind or dps?
[8:03:51] sixpackchad: is this your SoD PvP tier list?
[8:04:14] notJumu: burst is king and no one is gonna do more burst than a shaman in p2
[8:04:19] Dakkroth: same with mages, can bump them up in a rly good players hands but its like hard to judge
[8:04:23] moarpwp: can you tell me what makes shadow S+ ,ok dispersion is superb  defensive but offense wise dunno
[8:04:29] dwamatic: the primary reason to play Horde on priest ?
[8:04:55] Dakkroth: think dispersion was overkill for shadow next phase
[8:04:57] deltrexx: why boomy so high
[8:05:00] Dakkroth: theyre gna be so insane
[8:05:16] dwamatic: dot, dot, dot, disperse
[8:05:22] dogsenses: obv fotm re-rollers are gonna perform worse than shaman mains likewise mage mains
[8:05:29] Dakkroth: all the void plague scaling with sform and the 10% flat from talents etc
[8:05:30] t0nger1: why dou think ret will remain S? i think there are no good ret runes for p2
[8:05:32] Dakkroth: big pumpuuu
[8:05:35] Nizzftw: warriors will rekt priests and boomkins easily
[8:05:43] goldenteething: resto druid going to be beter and not go oom insta?
[8:05:52] abatement454: are you going to lvl priest or druid first?
[8:06:09] Dakkroth: so annoying that I feel like I have to level troll tho
[8:06:12] Dakkroth: still no word on racial swaps
[8:06:15] typhunreal1: ret wheelchair?

[8:09:58] saund: or am i blind
[8:10:03] Dakkroth: lets be real tho, biggest issue with troll is just having to play as troll
[8:10:07] hagbulbia: FERAL gonna be insane
[8:10:14] feebeater: imorph
[8:10:23] notJumu: @MannySJ no u cant use penance in a shapeshift and shadowform is a shapeshift
[8:10:34] Dakkroth: I thought holy could be a big wild card too with spirit of redeemer
[8:10:46] Dakkroth: 30 sec duration in classic pvp situation is crazy
[8:10:52] krontos7717: Why lock is so low?
[8:11:14] saund: where would you place prot warrior @Hydramist
[8:11:23] 5733pw47k3r: whats this tier list about?
[8:11:51] notJumu: lol if it wins u the clash it could be worth the buff wipe
[8:11:56] IIPatto: @dakkroth are u playing priest too in p2 ?
[8:12:08] Dakkroth: they added a bunch of prot runes for later phases that looked gross for pvp
[8:12:09] MannySJ: Art of war doesn't give you an instant flash so doubt it
[8:12:11] Nizzftw: is that arcane healing or arcane dps?
[8:12:14] abatement454: can't decide between balance or shadow to start p2
[8:12:15] Dakkroth: @IIPatto for sure
[8:12:15] abatement454: for pvp
[8:12:37] htvizzle: shockadin dream is so real
[8:12:40] Dakkroth: id defo change some specs now but ya
[8:12:51] rns_aurelius: arcane seems like it will be pretty good for pve
