[4:05:56] Vodkahawk: I think the fire bringing life thing is probably based on real life, some trees and plants can't grow unless they are burnt by fire, usually areas that usually burn every so often. It helps strengthen the trees and even some need the heat for the seeds to mature. There are frost plants like that too, gotta freeze them to mimic winter to make it sprout.

[4:28:13] 인터넷포트: then too bad thats ur fault
[4:28:15] carlierae1973: so you're screwed if you have an afk player
[4:28:23] HurricaneWho: if you alt-f4 you should get a standdown before you can log back in
[4:28:24] 인터넷포트: if u dc why should everyone be punished the game should carry one
[4:28:33] mrblond5: forever in solo que LUL
[4:28:34] ublargowilla: or if you leave you forfit and enemy gets full win, and you get a full loss registered
[4:28:47] 인터넷포트: no they c an make it to where even if u log or quit u stay in that instance its very easy

[4:29:28] mrblond5: The only way they can fix this is u loose ratings if u dc from the game or whatever
[4:29:31] Allydian: what if you accidentally d/c or your power shuts off
[4:29:35] 인터넷포트: lot of games have done similar things
[4:29:49] 인터넷포트: then ur toon is stuck in arena until u re log
