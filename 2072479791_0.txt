[3:58:15] SippinSimpSyrup: just putting more stamina on gear is a bad solution, the more the game progresses the more stamina people will need. Hunters already have 5K HP..... at 60 they could have like 8-9k. they need to just reduce the dmg, not increase peoples health.

[3:59:20] Kalus2: Hello Payo how you doin' having good time as always
[3:59:57] legendarism: they cant increase the stamina they have to decreasee the dmg of spells
[3:59:58] SippinSimpSyrup: hard disagree, reduce dmg.  at this rate people gonna have 10k hp end game.

[8:32:59] bonyato: doesnt matter
[8:32:59] paco__gutierrez: It got normalized
[8:33:03] phatnuggztv: no. they normallized all Raptor strike damage based on a 2.4 weapon
[8:33:04] WalterweightTV: it was a cool idea to get a buff for wearing same type of wep
[8:33:06] BeotchDaysha: LMAOOOOO and were perverts
[8:33:07] braaz99: Yes raptor strike is weapon damage scaling
[8:33:11] phatnuggztv: all you want is Stats + Weapon dps
[8:33:16] jasonsoo2010: Question to chat, what is your favourite wow xpac other than vanilla? Mine is still TBC (2006/07)
[8:33:21] st0neh: Even normalized slower weapons have higher damage
[8:33:27] WalterweightTV: Now the encounter will be more long, it a nerf for all class nerfing hunter
[8:33:28] phatnuggztv: all 1h sword/axe/fist get bumped up or down to 2.4
[8:33:29] aftamath2016: wotlk
[8:33:32] Pokey3316: TBC by far
[8:33:33] paco__gutierrez: It's based off of DPS, speed doesn't matter
[8:33:40] tyreh1: u can do /loot and u see the rolls
[8:33:42] phatnuggztv: so faster weapons with high stats get the biggest buff from normalization
[8:33:42] hansib0i: normalized or not only changes how it scales with AP, slower still better for higher end dmg on the weapon itself
[8:33:43] steviej1234: @jasonsoo2010 legion
