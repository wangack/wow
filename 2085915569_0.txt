[0:24:12] TDPandorum: Who is Dorki? For the blind, He is the dog. For the hungry, He is the burger. For the thirsty, He is the oasis. If Dorki asks, I agree. If Dorki cooks, I let him. If Dorki has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Dorki has ten fans, then I am one of them. If Dorki has only one fan then that is me. If Dorki has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Dorki, then I am against the world.

[1:54:28] sparklifegaming: How does the RNG work? Can someone explain please?
[1:54:29] MeowDorei: i think instead of the RP happening here, it should happen at the start so one team just starts 20 seconds later for fun
[1:54:29] VincentVanGoat: @Maximum I like to think that as soon as a team loses a tourny admin just screams in discord "zone out". Bald Bandits had the boss in everbloom on .01% when Johnny Tournyrealm jumped in and blew their brains out
[1:54:29] smolderdaddyuwu: We're back bb! HAH
[1:54:29] cixxay: This dungeon gotta be taken out of the pool if this isnt fixed

[1:54:44] tykus21: That’s so dumb that that map should be banned from the pool.
[1:54:44] buzzkill00: thats gg
[1:54:48] zannuss: What is the difference between RPs

[5:37:08] L0WIIE: @Maximum  The use of two spaces after a period was a typographic convention that originated from the era of typewriters. Typewriters used monospaced fonts, where each character occupied the same amount of horizontal space. In this environment, using two spaces after a period helped to improve readability by providing a clearer visual break between sentences.
