[0:27:47] driftwood_tc: I like WW pvp... I suck at it, but LIKE it YesYes
[0:27:50] Ozgiliath: how do you think the armor nerfs will impact hpal and rsham?
[0:27:58] nikthevoker: SL earth ele leggo hurt my soul
[0:28:00] Zarkos: what is your favorite glad title?
[0:28:09] dipicat: everyone is over hyping these armor nerfs + buffs
[0:28:10] chervz: happy Monday!!!!!
[0:28:11] dipicat: its like 2% dmg
[0:28:15] dipicat: yeah
[0:28:32] zachgamegodx: dh dk is what kills em both ye
[0:28:40] zachgamegodx: ww dk but less do
[0:28:49] dipicat: idk if demo will actually be able to kill anything tho tbh lol
[0:28:50] Xeliumimar: running double demo
[0:28:52] leeka: all warlocks have the same demon armor?
[0:29:05] aultymalganis: sup ven
[0:29:07] Ga11owZ: shamans getting plate? or going to leather? what do you mean armor changes?
[0:29:07] leeka: all 3 specs have access to soullink
[0:29:15] Zumaji: demo is the only spec with soul link correct
[0:29:17] cuyovlr: can someone explain this to me? I currently have 487 pve gear, and if I want to get into pvp, do I LOSE dmg from getting honor gear first or does it make me stronger?
[0:29:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: If demo does a lot of physical damage, they are going to be stronger on plate targets and weaker on cloth ones
[0:29:22] bigmancamx: and soullink is only 5% in pvp
[0:29:23] zachgamegodx: the eu guys like whazz were laughing at na bc we have a disc priest in the top 10 they think we don’t play meta
[0:29:23] dipicat: demo is the only spec  that reliably has a pet out rn
[0:29:30] jugganautjoe: what melee class does the most strictly physical damage. its gotta be betwee n WW Outlaw or Arms right
[0:29:30] leeka: aff and most destros just choose to sac pet instead
[0:29:36] dipicat: murk loves playing pet as destro but its problematic a lot of time
[0:29:40] flyingorangee: @venruki another spec to play in solo demo PauseChamp
[0:29:42] seaent: demo/shadow priest with the fear break buffs too
[0:29:53] starskedc: idk who that disc is but hes a lord
[0:29:56] Ernanz: EU players think they too good lol
[0:29:57] exizt_01: i think youre gonna see interesting comps again like sp hunt and sp war etc
[0:30:02] flyingorangee: Pog
[0:30:03] exizt_01: make it less pure double melee
[0:30:08] cuyovlr: chat, anyone know?:(
[0:30:17] peacant: did changes go through today?
[0:30:21] ImJordanHi: Whats even wrong with not playing "meta" its a video game, its supposed to be fun...
[0:30:32] Roidb0y: armor change is a strength nerf to warriors
[0:30:37] gdodmebxu: @cuyovlr i mean if you have 0 vers you'd just get oneshot
[0:30:44] Ernanz: who cares what Whaazz thinks lol wtf
[0:30:52] chervz: most games are meta slaves now a days. it’s apart of the gaming culture
[0:30:54] cuyovlr: @gdodmebxu I have 30% from my pve gear, I just mean is 476 pvp gear stronger than my 487 pve?

[0:45:52] mathiasp19: @venruki thinking of playing mw. short opinion for beginners?
[0:45:55] kusoneko: the 1 second of confusion of "did we win?!"
[0:46:15] driftwood_tc: more passive than Rdruid?
[0:46:24] Roxxybolts: that depends tho
[0:46:25] jporter_: MW is great for beginners I think
[0:46:33] GoblinRekka: mw is most passive by default imo
[0:46:34] Roxxybolts: unless you are a gigachad MW like rezain
[0:46:48] Riggabey: @cinematx he died once
[0:46:56] mathiasp19: thanks!
[0:47:03] ayalcoh1: Why it feels like presv evoker that you hots doesnt do nothing vs double melees burst

[0:48:08] Sleepiihead: BEGGING for rewind buffs
[0:48:15] fugginhiding: how has dh not gotten insane nerfs. In a lobby with 2 rn and I may as well not be playing the game
[0:48:16] skez_live: I use a rewind weakaura that TRIES to help me get a decent value, but its sitll not great lol
[0:48:19] dbmx1: why do you think enhance has gone unchanged for so long when it has such low representation
[0:48:21] zachgamegodx: i hit a 700 k rewind yesterday
[0:48:21] jporter_: was hoping you would make my Q pop :(

[0:53:20] skez_live: @Nitsud97 r sham is not easy to play IMO, it might be easy-ish if you just sit back and heal, but to get the most of it you gotta use your utility well.
[0:53:25] eainzsp: static field is such a cool ability
[0:53:28] skez_live: and people gotta not run outta your totems lol
[0:53:55] Nitsud97: @skez_live ye thx men got the same thoughts about the totems :D

[0:59:18] Beer0saurus: lemon and steak are not the combo lol
[0:59:20] Xeliumimar: if you cook a steak right, you dont need sauce
[0:59:21] kusoneko: salt pepper garlicpowder, over charcoal all you need
[0:59:22] CesarGaming: i love a good ribeye
[0:59:24] zachgamegodx: god dam I wanted that secret tip like the lemon on watermelon tip
[0:59:25] foxyllama: tons of butter
[0:59:36] dinnagga: A little mushroom redwine sauce
[0:59:37] purpdrink: you can dry brine over night if you want but just reverse sear and you cant go wrong
[0:59:41] Beer0saurus: mushroom/onion/scallop topping
[1:00:45] korgare: @foxyllama I fw that HARD my boy

[1:02:50] GoblinRekka: wasted global when people teleport out
[1:03:11] GoblinRekka: earthen opens a portal to exactly the outside of earthen

[1:05:32] Ernanz: what is this dumb thing with the 0 points..
[1:05:45] frazzoqt: Both healers 0 cr change
[1:05:47] foxyllama: real question is, what would chrislongtv do there
[1:05:58] Sluurrpp: i was the shaman, that lobby sucked ass to heal
[1:06:05] amgine04: beefy proud of you anyway
[1:06:10] IforestFrostmourne: honestly an immediate change blizz should make to healer mmr, crazy how that was healing dps with 200+ higher mmr

[1:07:06] korgare: Wild
[1:07:06] Itankarenas: it's aight
[1:07:09] flawfox: would feel babooshka gameplay
[1:07:13] 인터넷포트: sounds like were in a arcade playing pacman type of beat
[1:07:23] nikthevoker: when i have to spam deathstrike, id rather sit in earthen to do it
[1:07:29] Ernanz: this mage looks so much better as a Male
[1:07:32] Itankarenas: Babooshka music should be like hardstyle
[1:07:40] Ambersulfr: real
[1:07:56] ShaHugs: should get  the haste trinket upgrade
[1:07:57] ShaHugs: big haste
[1:08:00] Swertson: @venruki have you tried dh this season?

[1:09:08] Sluurrpp: I enjoyed your video about rewards not being obtainable,  Appreciate you making that, hopefully the right people see it
[1:09:10] dipicat: my demon hunter is ranked 27th or something at 26+ in shuff
[1:09:11] Sosatko: Is AWC this weekend?
[1:09:12] kusoneko: tossing out fat meatballs is fun
[1:09:14] ShaHugs: female def bis
[1:09:15] dipicat: my boomy is r1 at same rating
[1:09:16] 3KuLTV: ive heard mixed things about resto but to me, it looks fun and fairly decent
[1:09:16] dipicat: nice
[1:09:33] skez_live: Ven do you have an r-druid you play sometimes as well?
[1:09:37] Itankarenas: look at that fuckin belly. that r1 bulge
[1:09:44] ShaHugs: I'm rank 21 at 2450 as enh :)
[1:09:46] foxyllama: rsham mains?
[1:09:49] Sosatko: Same as rogue the only ppl that cry about rogue are rogue mains
[1:09:51] Sosatko: LOL
[1:09:58] Protocol_H: Has the conquest cap been removed yet?
[1:09:59] dipicat: rsham has some fundamentally annoying shit with earthern/link
[1:10:00] foxyllama: plz elaborate
[1:10:02] marvin1995xo: is resto shaman good wiht haste ?
[1:10:05] foxyllama: lmfao
[1:10:06] ezprit07: Disc isnt fun to play?
[1:10:15] kusoneko: WE MISS EARTHQUAKE ELE
[1:10:15] nikthevoker: DH and rogue are disgusting
[1:10:16] dipicat: @foxyllama what hes trying to say is u a bish ho
[1:10:16] foxyllama: LMFAO
[1:10:18] dazuu_: do you think they will every add rewards to 2s rating?
[1:10:24] foxyllama: ALL I DO IS CRY ABOUT IT
[1:10:28] Sosatko: Is AWC this weekend or next?
[1:10:28] SweatyDaniels: you aint cool unless you pee your pants
[1:10:36] 3KuLTV: im new to healing & pvp, do you think resto shaman would be fine to start with?
[1:10:39] jmetz75: how do you get Battle Mender title
[1:10:39] itzshenny: What is the best mele?
[1:10:46] dipicat: foxy hates that he has to play mastery and have slow globals
[1:10:46] Xeliumimar: shamans dont heal, their totems do LUL
[1:10:47] itzshenny: not rogue
[1:10:47] hivenzino: EWT is invisible on the ground
[1:10:49] Synkz_00: I cry and piss my pants, nothing to do with shamans or anything in wow tbh
[1:10:55] jmonttheking: i think rogue is harder to play then people think it is
[1:10:59] foxyllama: its all passive healing, little active and all ur cds die.
[1:11:01] organicsungrown: I feel like some shamans forget they can cast healing surge @venruki
[1:11:07] Protocol_H: Has the conquest cap been removed yet?
[1:11:08] Ernanz: they just want their class to counter eveything lmfao @foxyllama youre a perfect example
[1:11:29] willie_stroker_99: First me as a rdruid to verse an rshaman is pain
[1:11:31] pisceslonewolf: Totem gameplay is massively annoying for sure @foxyllama
[1:11:43] willie_stroker_99: For*
[1:11:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Running around frogging people
[1:11:48] Itankarenas: playing shaman, doesn't like totems HUH
[1:11:54] skez_live: @pisceslonewolf yeah thats the kicker for me, its fun BUT... fuck totems
[1:11:59] flames222: i feel like if you face ppl that are good at killing totems, rsham falls off
[1:12:04] joyrex_j9: totems are awesome until people are tunneling them
[1:12:04] 3KuLTV: do you think rshaman is a good choice for someone new to healing & pvp?
[1:12:11] pisceslonewolf: The idea of totems is vastly different from melee using macros and addons to insta-tab target kill em!
[1:12:12] zachgamegodx: u know the meme where the guys with his gf and hes looking behind him at the other girl and his gf is mad
[1:12:12] ShaHugs: totemic rsham inc
[1:12:12] Somanie: Proc💩 let's goooo
[1:12:25] Sosatko: If Rsham had insane throughput like rdruid for example its toolkit owuld be way to strong
[1:12:27] zachgamegodx: that resto shaman (the gf) and pres evoker is the girl walking away
[1:12:31] skez_live: im glad totems exist because its good to have a different playstyle
[1:12:36] skez_live: its just not for everyone
[1:12:46] dipicat: rsham getting lasso is really solid
[1:12:59] dipicat: ill make an rsham w boxes tomorrow
[1:13:00] dipicat: w dmg buffs
[1:13:02] dipicat: yeah exactly
[1:13:08] kusoneko: member when lasso did damage
[1:13:11] joyrex_j9: they just need to add some ability where you "trap" your totems and do some form of cc or punishment for attacking them on a cd
[1:13:12] hivenzino: totems killable in one gcd vs druid's treants with high HP is bad
[1:13:15] panasiuk97: ele shaman gameplay?
[1:13:16] pisceslonewolf: As an Ele sham (played a lil resto and disc). Resto sham seems cool to play, but usually a bit undertuned and primarily totems dying is really BS compared to other cooldowns.
[1:13:17] 3KuLTV: i tried rdruid but i struggled i little bit tbh
[1:13:30] Sosatko: Remember when Rsham stormkeeper 50-0d ppl lol
[1:13:32] ZealotryTV: are people just assuming boxes are coming or did they confirm?
[1:13:35] dipicat: foxy gonna be questioning his entire life when he checks deathlogs and dipilga killed him w stormkeeper
[1:13:36] jmetz75: healer Qs take this long?
[1:13:38] gothiquecat: Do you ever feel like resto shamans dont have enough cooldowns? /s
[1:13:40] josk3r: the lava lava resto will be good i think
[1:13:47] zachgamegodx: about as ridicilous as ring of fires dot ven
[1:13:47] Endoraesh: i boosted a DH and i feel so scummy....but i love it
[1:13:49] zachgamegodx: deadass
[1:13:58] Intravz: treants still have way more health than totems unforch
[1:14:02] pisceslonewolf: @joyrex_j9 Good idea
[1:14:05] pisceslonewolf: @hivenzino Yep
[1:14:12] zachgamegodx: the reapplication part of it
[1:14:14] zachgamegodx: not the initial
[1:14:24] dakotan517: i always run out of it
[1:14:28] itzshenny: Best mele? not rogue tho
[1:14:31] zachgamegodx: like the fact that u can take it again if u get dispelled
[1:14:34] dakotan517: @itzshenny dh
[1:14:34] zachgamegodx: yeah
[1:14:34] amgine04: most people saying this don't play rsham. it's main problem is positional and requiring people to play near you/on earthen for it to have actual cds :|
[1:14:49] skez_live: @amgine04 yeah
[1:14:54] amgine04: hense the frustration in shuffles :)
[1:14:54] ShaHugs: RoF does like 40% of mage overall to players into melee cleave
[1:14:58] zachgamegodx: well you can be knocked...forcefully back into it ven
[1:15:08] jugganautjoe: if you made it not reapply the game becomes too easy and if blizz catered to every change that way arena could be played on mobile
[1:15:09] Somanie: Good >:)
[1:15:09] Metaphors: i cannot believe
[1:15:10] pisceslonewolf: @amgine04 Yep
[1:15:14] Metaphors: this is a conversation
[1:15:17] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[1:15:29] xBenww: just dont stand in the damn fire
[1:15:31] Somanie: Uh oh
[1:15:45] Somanie: Metaphors was tweaking this morning in cdew's chat
[1:15:45] ferahgok: WoW 101: Don't stand in the fire
[1:15:56] Sosatko: I love me some mage lock
[1:16:02] gdodmebxu: uhdk dh Kappa
[1:16:06] gamer_dad_01: Ven do you think the unnerf to feral - bearform healing is going to be enough. sorry cant remember name of ability
[1:16:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Clip it LUL
[1:16:20] Sosatko: Rogue X X will be the best
[1:16:24] zachgamegodx: nah im just trolling a bit, but i do think it's really strong, and probably shouldn't be a pvp talent for arcane
[1:16:25] xBenww: would you say arms/boomy is a good comp?
[1:16:28] Metaphors: its dh dk meta
[1:16:28] itzshenny: rogue mage will always be the best
[1:16:33] gdodmebxu: that's because they're melee fotm players KEKW
[1:16:34] Dreathhammer: #alwayscastermeta :)
[1:16:39] pisceslonewolf: Rogue-lock or DH-lock
[1:16:47] PuffnTuff: i hate the melee casters
[1:16:58] ShaHugs: ret is a caster too
[1:17:00] sourbutts: ret is pretty close to being a caster too
[1:17:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rogue lock might be freakish
[1:17:10] foxyllama: im sniping u
[1:17:12] albag04: @venruki I don't know what to choose between Unholy Death Knight or Windwalker Monk or  Demon hunter What do you think I should choose as my main from these classes and try to achieve a rating of 2000 in 2v2 & 3v3 The reason I'm asking is because I enjoy the playstyle of both, but I'm not sure which one is more fun and worth trying to reach 2k with.
[1:17:21] gdodmebxu: @albag04 all 3 of those are insane
[1:17:21] sylvesterinhd: what is your highest rated healer?
[1:17:34] Sosatko: DH
[1:17:54] Holtan3111: Hey Venruki ! Hope you are having a great stream so far. Have you checked out Navian yet ? :) i really think you would like them
[1:17:57] Somanie: Dh and ww prob have more movement
[1:17:57] foxyllama: this is a mmr donation
[1:18:02] dakotan517: 2k is free as dh
[1:18:04] martinuslol: DK is getting nerfed next patch though aren't they?
[1:18:08] dakotan517: rerolled one and on third day got it
[1:18:08] ShaHugs: @albag04 are you just copy pasting this in every stream
[1:18:10] gdodmebxu: @martinuslol not really
[1:18:13] gdodmebxu: tiny nerf
[1:18:24] Sosatko: Are you excited to maybe be able to leave a pillar vs hunters tomorrow on mage?
[1:18:25] pozzzgg: dude i just went 5-1 in solo im proud of myself i think i played that game pretty well as well
[1:18:40] ShaHugs: necro got close to 20% nerf, it's huge
[1:18:41] Sosatko: Hmm really?
[1:18:50] Nateypww: I love venruki
[1:18:52] Hobblefoot: I don't understand Resto Shaman. I am in a Solo right now and cannot live after my totems are on CD in here.
[1:18:52] Falcanus: its big for plate, not much for casters
[1:18:53] pisceslonewolf: It's changing mostly for lock and for warriors.
[1:18:56] Dreathhammer: rip hpal :P
[1:18:58] blueboywiz: you’ll see more ret
[1:19:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: The hunter burst they were putting on mages is still mostly going to be the same, true
[1:19:08] gdodmebxu: @Falcanus it's barely changing phys reduction
[1:19:10] thebarnabyangel: ret is going to be insane -_-
[1:19:11] johnnyquestz: percentage of damage reduction seemed to be pretty small changes for most classes, yeah?
[1:19:14] joyrex_j9: I tested boosting armor with the pally talent that gives you armor on wog.. it barely changes anything lol
[1:19:15] Ernanz: yeah go watch Supatease on YouTube TIME TO REROLL GUYSSSS DEMO  LOCKS ARE GONNAS BE INSANEEEE
[1:19:18] Ernanz: jesus christ..
[1:19:20] ShaHugs: turbo cleaves kill hpal a lot
[1:19:25] pisceslonewolf: Ret is not going to be insane. It'll be pretty good again
[1:19:30] PuffnTuff: i think plate will get a bigger hit then cloth is getting a buff, due to sheer armor value of plate vs cloth
[1:19:39] kusoneko: DKs gonna take some big donger now right
[1:19:48] blueboywiz: demo rsham dk
[1:19:52] eebrandt123: @venruki think SP will become more meta tomorrow?
[1:19:53] pisceslonewolf: @PuffnTuff So rogues and DHs come out on top again KMS
[1:19:55] elless78: nice queue time
[1:20:01] gdodmebxu: do people think it's 30% more phys dmg taken for plate? I don't understand why they think losing a couple % of phys dmg reduction will make plate awful
[1:20:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Send it!
[1:20:02] gamer_dad_01: was foxy succesfull
[1:20:16] seekerimSENI: what healer is the easiest to climb in solo shuffle in your opinion? @venruki
[1:20:18] PuffnTuff: @pisceslonewolf dhs are magic so they already ignore armour, alot of sub rogue is shadow as well
[1:20:25] jporter_: had to watch the vod, was awesome to play with you. I kinda threw the round the rogue died. i couldve kept him alive
[1:20:32] PuffnTuff: @pisceslonewolf things like warrior bm hunter will go up
[1:20:40] pisceslonewolf: @PuffnTuff Sure but in comparison they were not touched. So that's a net-buff.
[1:20:42] foxyllama: LMFAO
[1:20:43] gamer_dad_01: he is going to que on druid lol
[1:20:43] joyrex_j9: playing a little rdruid will do that to you
[1:20:49] ShaHugs: sub rogue's shadow damage scales off the initial hit, so if someone has less armor the shadow hit is bigger
[1:20:49] PuffnTuff: true
[1:20:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL Just like those rogue guys always saying how bad their class is
[1:20:52] foxyllama: ur lucky its a mage/lock meta
[1:20:56] pisceslonewolf: @PuffnTuff Warriors are loosing that strength from talent
[1:21:02] PuffnTuff: oh yeah
[1:21:06] Somanie: Kappa
[1:21:09] JSaucy_v1: I think that's true for anyone not happy with the state of their main
[1:21:12] seekerimSENI: what healer is the easiest to climb in solo shuffle in your opinion? @venruki
[1:21:16] gamer_dad_01: Kappa
[1:21:19] JSaucy_v1: most people are more critical of their main class
[1:21:26] banethrog: Kappa
[1:21:28] Sosatko: BOP lobby
[1:21:31] Somanie: @gamer_dad_01 :O you were there
[1:21:41] gamer_dad_01: @Somanie yes sir
[1:21:41] Somanie: Kappa let's gooo
[1:21:42] chubmax: @seekerimSENI dh
[1:21:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Frog him!
[1:21:46] gdodmebxu: plate is going to take 3% more phys damage, guys it's a caster meta Kappa
[1:21:56] pisceslonewolf: @gdodmebxu 4Head
[1:21:58] Gaxim_TV: yay a devastation in the game
[1:21:59] Kittensrcute: no gear Pog
[1:22:03] gamer_dad_01: why was his gear not there?
[1:22:07] Holtan3111: looks like a hard lobby for Rsham
[1:22:08] pisceslonewolf: Devestation is everywhere now
[1:22:10] chubmax: @gdodmebxu i think it will be caster/DH meta
[1:22:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Training the blue is just plain fun
[1:22:39] Adorabell1: Adorabell1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 73 months! happy subversary
[1:22:47] wiredPANDA: dev immediately walks out earthen wall - cries in rsham
[1:22:58] gdodmebxu: i don't think the meta changes much at all. you just won't win as uhdk/dh healer if you're completely terrible now Kappa
[1:22:59] Holtan3111: Imagine your best defensive is an area where your neanderthal team mates have to stay inside to benefit from it
[1:23:10] Hobblefoot: I already see a difference in my game right now and Vens. Hahaha they don't go near him. I am zerged
[1:23:37] JSaucy_v1: I think there may be an uptick in MM hunters hitting the scene.  Could also be my bias of not wanting to play BM.
[1:23:41] chubmax: @gdodmebxu locks will be even tankier - arms gets hurt and so does dk
[1:23:47] chubmax: i think demo will become S
[1:24:03] gdodmebxu: @chubmax brother the armor changes do not change phys reduction much at all for any of the classes it touches
[1:24:12] anacronz: all locks are allrdy s
[1:24:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: whew
[1:24:17] chubmax: demo isnt S
[1:24:24] Hark0n: got a 478k glacial in arena pogface
[1:24:27] gdodmebxu: demo is definitely s right now
[1:24:28] pisceslonewolf: @chubmax Kapp
[1:24:32] abruptdecayO_O: good show
[1:24:36] ezprit07: DiscPriest isnt fun rn?
[1:24:40] freelofear: hpally getting trained by ass rogue, classic
[1:25:04] gdodmebxu: @chubmax 3% more phys dmg taken is not the end of the world for dk/arms KEKW
[1:25:21] gdodmebxu: very few specs even do phys dmg to begin with
[1:25:24] chubmax: did you do the math?>  35% is 3% dmg reduc?
[1:25:38] nerdyorc_: they really need to punish leaving more, I cant get a 5-1 or 6-0 as a healer because the other guy leaves
[1:25:53] pisceslonewolf: People just need to finally read what "armor" says in stats
[1:25:57] chubmax: so what youre saying is DH meta
[1:26:04] ferrers__: What is the least played class?
[1:26:12] PKGOD: Winners will be Spriest, Demo/Destro, and Ret. UDK will be slightly easier to kill vs Arms
[1:26:14] gdodmebxu: @chubmax yes you can do it too. hit pvp dummy look at phys reduction on armor tooltip and take 35% off and figure out phys reduction for that armor value
[1:26:19] Magottx: What’s up fam. You feelin better today?
[1:26:34] pisceslonewolf: @ferrers__ Feral, fire mage, Augvoker, Holy priest
[1:26:40] gdodmebxu: @chubmax i really think people think it's 35% more dmg taken when that's not how armor works at all KEKW
[1:27:04] chubmax: guess well see tomorrow
[1:27:08] gdodmebxu: don't need to see
[1:27:11] gdodmebxu: calc it yourself
[1:27:18] Itankarenas: gettin damp in here monkaS
[1:27:22] malvarcla: the new meta is going to be so insane, double mage is going to be new meta since they are basically going to be warriors with their defense and insane damage
[1:27:30] dakotan517: relative to sub prob is what they mean?
[1:27:31] pisceslonewolf: @malvarcla KEKW
[1:27:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Asassination does not seem bad at all
[1:27:35] chubmax: i think demo is going to be huge
[1:27:35] gamer_dad_01: they just say bad because the other two are so much better
[1:27:39] gamer_dad_01: buts its still s
[1:27:47] GiiGa07: Demo sub payoS
[1:27:52] chubmax: kek
[1:28:11] gdodmebxu: the armor changes really don't do much at all
[1:28:12] Krayik: Constant pressure with top tier CC is always good, just not always easy.
[1:28:39] chubmax: i have a hard time beliving a 35% change is nothing
[1:28:42] pisceslonewolf: You what would be kinda cool and nice. If Resto sham had a grip like priests. Hard to call it OP, but nice.
[1:28:44] gdodmebxu: calc it yourself man
[1:28:45] Magottx: Assa can play the old Los between kidneys and it’s so good still.
[1:28:46] gdodmebxu: like what
[1:29:01] chubmax: warrs lose str bc of the talent that scales it off armor
[1:29:02] chubmax: so it depends
[1:29:04] bonchwater1: Is 3s mmr feeling better this season boys?
[1:29:20] gdodmebxu: the damage reduction lost is really small
[1:29:20] JSaucy_v1: @bonchwater1 Yes.
[1:29:23] pisceslonewolf: @bonchwater1 Not compared to the earlier seasons. That's never the case for late stage expansion
[1:29:42] chubmax: 10% stam increase also huge for locks
[1:29:44] bonchwater1: @pisceslonewolf earlier seasons in this expansion or in past expansions?
[1:29:46] chubmax: cuz dark pact
[1:30:00] Sleepiihead: i hate when ppl timestop when im not in cc
[1:30:00] nikthevoker: i use it every round
[1:30:00] pisceslonewolf: @bonchwater1 This expansion ofc. It goes from high to low every time
[1:30:01] Krayik: Always wonder what dev needs to actually be meta. Is it defensive cds while cc'd or resource refund when kicked on disint?
[1:30:06] Chris7ka: you just cyclone yourself KEKW
[1:30:09] bonchwater1: @pisceslonewolf I see
[1:30:12] kusoneko: KEKW
[1:30:14] gdodmebxu: @chubmax ignore pain is hp based too
[1:30:16] nikthevoker: well almost
[1:30:20] gdodmebxu: tons of things are
[1:30:41] pisceslonewolf: Dreanei racial heal is buffed come wednesday then Pog
[1:30:49] chubmax: so it should slow down the meta a bit
[1:30:53] chubmax: whichi i s why i think demo will be better
[1:31:01] Chris7ka: @pisceslonewolf The real win no one is talking about POGGERS
[1:31:05] gdodmebxu: demo is good now and will still be good
[1:31:09] donchamp: torn between mage or rogue main, any suggestions?

[1:40:04] ferahgok: @What_ln_Tarnation Just gotta turn off chat, put on some good tunes, and press the que button.
[1:40:19] What_ln_Tarnation: @Somanie or just realize wow is a game and you should play it for entertainment and not to want to kill yourself
[1:40:26] Somanie: Also depends on which healer you played ;-;
[1:40:35] Badasti: on the mend SeemsGood
[1:40:44] Gaxim_TV: hpriest will be insane
[1:40:47] DrewPBallz18: do u know the drop chance of the thunder fury pieces in MC

[1:41:05] Gaxim_TV: already insane healing
[1:41:06] Somanie: @what_ln_tarnation what healer did you play bb? Maybe we can figure this shit out together
[1:41:07] skez_live: @x9nwc haha yeah Disc seems just so much more chill to heal on but you cut your utility by like 90%
[1:41:09] What_ln_Tarnation: @ferahgok i have no issue with chat, dont mind shit talking
[1:41:17] crawnpocktail: can you play some frost for my 2s partner
[1:41:31] What_ln_Tarnation: @Somanie mw
[1:41:34] MaximumnNeo: im probably in minority but i already think Holy is as good or better than disc, before the buffs.
[1:41:50] crawnpocktail: This song was on aggressive inline if anyone played that game
[1:42:10] danieljjohnsonn: Hey ven, just wondered why Arance supposed to so hard to play? pika said its hardest in game? I thought sub would be tbh, but don't know much about arcance
[1:42:16] Somanie: @what_ln_tarnation hmmm I have no experience playing mw... seems like you'd get locked down depending on the lobby though
[1:42:16] danieljjohnsonn: arcane*
[1:42:44] Intravz: what were average DPS SS ques in S1? i only played healer
[1:42:53] morrs: Ven, have you tried how Warlocks perform this patch? Thoughts? :)
[1:42:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: They say arcane has a tough rotation to learn for PvE
[1:43:26] yctnm: the nuclear launch sequence monkaEyes
[1:43:35] BMaStream: Hey Ven what are your thoughts on Stuff being better than Things? Most people think Things were overtuned, but Stuff seems easier for most players. I'm not sure though
[1:44:23] lasergazer3: Wait did you race change?
[1:44:24] xBenww: i was just floating when there anfter but i couldnt fine out but then i when the turned arounds, so thats probably why i could when the orange stopped
[1:44:28] danieljjohnsonn: I saw your vid on locks being too tanky potentially from tomorrow, What would your thoughts of been if they had just put bolts bigger again and kept armour same?
[1:44:29] Hobblefoot: Is your MMR 1430?  Because if so I might get you in my lobby!
[1:44:38] Hobblefoot: Probably not.
[1:44:54] What_ln_Tarnation: @Somanie maybe with stam boost itll be easier, but rn if i get 1 cc on me, my team mate dies
[1:45:28] afoscastro: at this point do you preffer viable classes over the ones you pref the "lore"
[1:45:31] gdodmebxu: why do people think the armor change will change much? KEKW
[1:45:38] danieljjohnsonn: like start of season, when Chaos bolts hitting like 400K
[1:45:39] dubbfiend: hopin for some late Monday updates to the patch notes
[1:45:43] danieljjohnsonn: 300-400K
[1:45:46] birdysanders: warlocks dont need anything lmfao
[1:45:47] gdodmebxu: the lock thing is a bug increasing total instead of base armor
[1:45:50] BMaStream: I think the fear damage break will be better than the armor change
[1:46:14] Hobblefoot: Wait ... Resto Shaman needs around 100 Mastery??? What the!
[1:46:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've seen huge chaos bolts flying around

[1:54:33] JSaucy_v1: I think on paper, the armor changes don't sound like much, but we've seen how the math plays out sometimes in game
[1:54:47] JSaucy_v1: take deathbolt for instance when it was 100-0'ing people

[1:55:11] gdodmebxu: @JSaucy_v1 brother armor has fixed scaling, you can calc the dmg reduction lost/gained yourself

[2:07:05] Hexneo: @venruki  the real why so small amount of ppl in 2.4 is because price is to high, and I real know what I am saying because I have so many friends boosters...
[2:07:21] Hexneo: @venruki  so please open your opinion about boosters plz
[2:07:29] tidopx: down goes... :(

[2:08:32] VetisBR: wow is so hard to see that stuff sometimes. you think you are ok with high alter and its gone
[2:08:37] Ambersulfr: yeah... double shaman and they're probably both playing double purge
[2:08:39] ShaHugs: random purge?
[2:08:47] gdodmebxu: that lobby was terrible for mage
[2:08:48] MakuuuTV: they weren't even trying to purge alter lmao

[2:09:50] beastnephew3: instant que?

[2:09:53] aUNINGz: What is the addon for the penalty for sec stats?
[2:10:07] Badasti: i still dont think ele should have burrow along with the rest of their kit. They should lose something like  grounding to compensate
[2:10:10] flawfox: @aUNINGz True stat values
[2:10:44] Hexneo: 2 years ago was so many in 2.4 because price was not so high
[2:11:04] Hexneo: now many boosters gone becuase of you know why....
[2:11:11] Hexneo: was from special region...
[2:11:14] gdodmebxu: @Hexneo dude what are you even typing
[2:11:14] Badasti: tell me what weakness ele has
[2:11:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: That moo-adin is pretty good, if I remember right

[2:12:15] MakuuuTV: o
[2:12:20] Badasti: shadowpriests get trained into the ground, ele has as much armour as a warrior and shits out meatballs 24/7 without even casting
[2:12:22] MakuuuTV: i forgot about that haha
[2:12:34] style5z: and no temporal
[2:12:51] Ambersulfr: blizzard could've scaled mail and leather too but they chose not to
[2:12:58] Ambersulfr: lazy of them imo
[2:12:59] Badasti: also got a better wall than mages and basically ice block with burrow, along with a short cd kick, stuns, and grounding
[2:14:26] joyrex_j9: I'm surprised they let the clone cast speed increase from HOTW slip through in these patch notes. Feels like a bug that it even works without moonkin form

[2:29:26] Locturnal_TV: theyve never healed
[2:29:32] ganjilicious: not enough cc's until you are a healer and you go against a dk

[2:34:14] connection29: pvp will continue to go down unless u make pvers interested in playing for the rewards
[2:34:22] OMGWhatsHisFace: if you're relevant at all you have haters
[2:34:26] ivoryghost_: @connection29 yup
[2:34:29] beastnephew3: i love you though….!?!
[2:34:33] FreddoB: jelousy

[2:35:23] foxyllama: im a hater
[2:35:31] Slayer_Eagleone: :D
[2:35:31] Tridos_: I feel you are one of the most reasonable voices of this community
[2:35:33] chancywilson: I dont think you have more hater then anyone else in the spotlight
[2:35:33] beastnephew3: gargle some warm salt water, slowly swallow some honey
[2:35:36] Tridos_: people are crazy
[2:35:38] Slayer_Eagleone: i hate Foxyllama
[2:35:40] Slayer_Eagleone: ngl
[2:35:41] Badasti: half of the population are below avg intelligence, it's not worth trying to understand everything you read online
[2:35:43] bransby09: On how they all adorn him
[2:35:52] connection29: all elitist pvpers cried about pve gear being in pvp that was the downfall of wow pvp
[2:35:53] rockwellhb: people nowadays are incapable of having a different opinion without going full aggro
[2:35:54] OMGWhatsHisFace: tbf you have to be some kind of weirdo to use the wow forums frequently
[2:35:59] Pontacos: I hate foxes and llamas
[2:36:03] Slayer_Eagleone: the rumor is that Foxyllama is a bank manager its what a birdie told me monkaS
[2:36:08] kone_malone: @connection29 LOL no sir
[2:36:16] jporter_: how is that the downfall lol, been the best thing ever
[2:36:17] ratbttm: that take you just read is the worst take of all takes in wow history
[2:36:19] kone_malone: PvE gear shouldn't be in pvp at all
[2:36:19] Tridos_: Gearing is at its peak
[2:36:22] phillybottz34: do u got an arcane mage guide never played that spec
[2:36:27] ivoryghost_: @connection29 pve gear by nature is harder to get than pvp gear should be
[2:36:29] kingjelly: i like the gearing
[2:36:32] foxyllama: https://prnt.sc/zD2YZXcKm7Xy
[2:36:32] theodeth: current gearing is goat
[2:36:42] whoischariie: thoughts on plate nerfs?
[2:36:43] Nuallan94: i wonder if theres some correlation betweeen participaion in s1 of shadowlands and pvp gear being reeally good in pve
[2:36:44] foxyllama: @Slayer_Eagleone
[2:36:45] tuhey: Thanks for the youtube updates ven :) Hope holy priest is meta now xD
[2:37:00] CuteKitkat: @foxyllama LOL
[2:37:04] chancywilson: cdew said no
[2:37:11] foxyllama: whats good?
[2:37:19] chancywilson: Cdew said holy P still will have mana probs
[2:37:20] Krayik: As a main PvE'er, being able to get close to equivalent items in PvP from PvE means I can actually step into PvP now rather than skipping seasons that I may be too busy to otherwise. It only increases participation.
[2:37:39] foxyllama: i think it will be decent
[2:37:43] foxyllama: not broken tho
[2:37:45] Pontacos: Itll be better for sure but will it be best no
[2:37:48] gazdaddy_: gearing is great rn. I just started wow for the first time two weeks ago with retail and as a completely new player, i have pvp ilvl 482, its a much lower barrier of entry
[2:37:50] kone_malone: WTB literally ANY enhance changes tomorrow PepePls
[2:37:52] aarongarey1993: In my country we have a status of foxylama
[2:38:07] jporter_: i love foxy
[2:38:18] kone_malone: @Krayik and you end up with things like drest trinket
[2:38:30] Falcanus: i dont think rdruids output will be affected that much, but they will go oom faster in shuffle since they cant drink and with increased hp pools. 3s i dont think will change
[2:38:38] Badasti: i never thought stepping into pvp was an issue until legion when you needed to have a second job of grinding borrowed power systems
[2:38:39] Dreathhammer: crafting costs are annoying though
[2:38:41] Krayik: Yeah I agree Venruki. I can snag 489 tier from raid and step into PvP. I still have PTSD from Cunning of the Cruel RBGs in Cata and am happy they fixed trinkets.
[2:38:43] abruptdecayO_O: pvp gearing is hella fast as a pve andy. i bought greens and queued like literally 5 bgs and could get into solo shuff
[2:38:46] Tridos_: I love the way it is rn, being able to just PVP for PVP gear an not have to do anything I dont want too
[2:38:48] birdysanders: being forced to do a 4 hour raid or have a disadvantage isnt sick
[2:38:57] Pontacos: Maybe this is how it is already but PVE gear should get you 90-95% of pvp gear so you can still do it but are at a disadvantage if you dont main it
[2:39:45] Pontacos: Because the argument for pvpers can be well my pvp gear should be the same for pve and i can step into mythic+ easy.
[2:39:45] Krayik: Yeah the spark system right now is the only min/max block for PvE'rs trying to PvP.
[2:40:00] korgare: M U S T    Z U G
[2:40:13] abruptdecayO_O: @Pontacos conquest gear is 454 so it already is like that
[2:40:21] gazdaddy_: i will say that one thing they could do better would be to just by default bring up the pvp ilvl in unrated for everyone. Like if by default unrated ilvl was 465 or something, then you could grind for the honor pvp set, then once 476 could grind for conquest, that would be the smoothest experience imo
[2:40:27] everquest101: that yell was very feminine
[2:40:38] Pontacos: @paprikafreaka Is pve gear only 454?
[2:40:41] QuonDot: Just pump dud
[2:40:48] abruptdecayO_O: @paprikafreaka you said step into m+
[2:40:50] aarongarey1993: Innit bruv you get me blud
[2:40:54] abruptdecayO_O: @paprikafreaka which 454 is more than enough to do
[2:41:14] Dreathhammer: drestagast.............
[2:41:22] Dreathhammer: voodoo totem....
[2:41:33] Pontacos: Enough to do a mythic or can you actually get raid groups being 454? I feel like you had to be 475+ or something
[2:41:46] Nuallan94: being a bis pve geared dh in end of bfa was what got me into pvp lmao
[2:41:48] hiighigan: what sword is that?
[2:41:52] Nuallan94: mythic slappers and gushing
[2:42:00] bigolemooseknuckle: Whenever you have to PvP to get the best PvE gear and vise versa it's always a problem
[2:42:07] drdoomkinx: i just wish they had diffreant stated pvp trinkets at this point like mastery badge haste badge mastery insignia
[2:42:08] bigolemooseknuckle: for trinkets especially
[2:42:15] HolyXct: @venruki would you say Hpala is better than disc priest rn?
[2:42:36] ohsomagical_: @nuallan94 ur a disgusting dh
[2:42:59] Pontacos: imo its not even really a gear thing rather than a class design thing. Put someone who has never done pvp before in full BIS pvp gear and they will still not have fun because its hard
[2:43:27] ohsomagical_: Unless u play dh then it's not hard anymore
[2:43:39] Pontacos: true
[2:43:50] everquest101: thats the reason each class should has a pvp talent  three instead to try to pvp using pve tools
[2:43:52] Spaceberry_McDuck: @bigolemooseknuckle i got back into pvp because in S1 SL, the pvp gear was competitive with pve gear. it was easier to get vers/haste gear for my DK. then i just kept pvping.
[2:45:14] FreddoB: they could just normalise gear for the whole exp. why regrind gear every season?
[2:45:44] ohsomagical_: Look how bad these guys are lmao
[2:46:05] Pontacos: lmao this is funny
[2:46:15] mfushi: cat and mouse
[2:46:20] agren13: "melee mobility is so op"
[2:46:20] splox122: is the S or the C silent in the word Scent?
[2:46:25] xoppose: @venruki  considering Warlocks are about to be super meta...Do you mind discussing what the strongest warlock counters are?
[2:46:28] jporter_: @FreddoB that would make the fotm stuff even worse imo
[2:46:44] QuonDot: @splox122 both Kappa
[2:46:51] Pontacos: Locks are about to be god tier
[2:46:56] splox122: dam
[2:47:03] 1nightplays: hit up sterge ?
[2:47:03] xoppose: yeah but whats their main counter? DK/DH?
[2:47:14] Pontacos: Actually think spriest makes a comeback too which is dope
[2:47:19] Ambersulfr: he's still traveling
[2:47:20] Pontacos: when casters own the game is fun
[2:47:24] Spaceberry_McDuck: i heard he's a chump
[2:47:25] kingsmackers: you thin mage/lcol or ele demo will just be the new meta for tomorrow
[2:47:26] ChunliWW: unironically sterge doesnt give a fuck about us
[2:47:37] Badasti: if only Sterge was a gamer
[2:47:37] Axtin: sterge qs for 30 minutes then goes back to shuff
[2:47:39] illEvan11_11: i just got hit with back to back ferocious bites of 304k and 249k and died 100-0 insta
[2:47:57] Nuallan94: voice with llama want to hear him stressed out
[2:48:03] boocraft1992: I fought Chun a few days and got whooped at 2300 MMR in 2s
[2:48:08] ohsomagical_: Give him a break man sterge only just learned to not click his frames.
[2:48:34] Pontacos: Sterg hardly likes queueing 3s with his team lmao - only because he has to and its his job
[2:48:39] hiddensquid13: arcane?!
[2:48:44] GiiGa07: Poggers
[2:48:44] Pontacos: Solo shuffle savior
[2:48:45] FreddoB: @jporter_ maybe but might be easier to balance out fotm with less changes in gearing
[2:49:05] QuonDot: Brock Lee
[2:49:22] boocraft1992: @ohsomagical_ only the GIGACHAD click their frames
[2:49:29] ChunliWW: ya i need 10 minb
[2:49:34] Vigi9413: is the best way to catch up pvp wise after not playing for years to just spam for honor gear in bgs?
[2:49:38] Ambersulfr: dh it is
[2:49:46] boocraft1992: @ChunliWW  I fought your orc monk in 2s a few days ago on my DH. You're insane
[2:49:51] Pontacos: @Vigi9413 Yeah probably
[2:49:57] vargath_: demon king time
[2:50:05] Sweetmat_34: mute?
[2:50:06] Pontacos: Get full honor gear then find someone to do 2s for conquest
[2:50:06] Swertson: @venruki I've been owning on hpriest today in shuff
[2:50:12] Pontacos: or just start spamming shuffle losses
[2:50:14] Badasti: dont do it Ven
[2:50:18] Deyconn: you not feeling good??
[2:50:25] aarongarey1993: Go see a doctor don't google symptoms
[2:50:25] 1nightplays: u like disc too or nah
[2:50:29] Vigi9413: i have health anxiety/ panic attacks can confirm googling symptoms is a terrible idea lol
[2:50:29] supatease: Ven can you look at your nails plz
[2:50:34] ShaHugs: loved playing with hpriest in SL
[2:50:47] paladinsareepic: do you have a second account or how can you swap between your charakters?
[2:50:52] Ambersulfr: look like normal nails
[2:50:53] Ambersulfr: they're clean
[2:50:58] Badasti: damn, those are some scoopers you got there

[4:20:19] rekt1370: resto died pretty easy to melee
[4:20:24] metajutsu: yeah the resto nerf was so random
[4:20:27] lilskeets: everyone thought resto sham was too tanky
[4:20:33] soothingmistmonk: I think if they nerfed shields it would make a difference
[4:20:38] Badasti: resto shamans having too much fun in wow
[4:20:40] Ey_an: the changes were for casters <1800 solo shuffle
[4:20:40] taylors09: the nerf to boomy should have been for ele 100%
[4:20:58] monkestronke: devoker has around 34% armor
[4:20:59] crawnpocktail: who the fuck cares abour armor in pve, completely unwarranted change
[4:20:59] Recyclemanx: Eles don't have moonkin aura :/
[4:21:14] rekt1370: hunters warriors monks ferals all physical

[4:22:39] man0litos: No way you are dropping 4set on resto
[4:22:44] man0litos: 15% on riptide is too strong
[4:22:45] crawnpocktail: they should rename defensive stance to stance
[4:23:07] JNE14: mastery on druid?
[4:23:26] soothingmistmonk: @venruki Do you think they need to give arcane the ability to gain chrono shift when they also blink?
[4:23:39] zachgamegodx: mastery sucks in pve bc nobody gets to 30%
[4:23:40] rekt1370: @soothingmistmonk  hell no LUL
[4:23:43] zachgamegodx: but in pvp it happens constantly
[4:23:58] Krayik: haste does affect totems now and totems are on the "aura" for the spec and modified with changes which were too big buffs
[4:24:09] DveevD: ^^
[4:24:10] lilskeets: do you think mage needs pod tender and triune ward back?
[4:24:13] joyrex_j9: most people have like 15-20% haste on rsham now with high mast
[4:24:24] joyrex_j9: not 5% lol
[4:24:35] Lydiayang: ye 15% ish haste makes your globals way better
[4:24:37] bornbetter: cdew plays like 120% mastery
[4:24:42] JustTaki: the difference between baiting kicks as ele with 35% haste vs Resto at 5% haste is brutal hehe

[4:26:53] kheilas: is he being serious
[4:27:13] crawnpocktail: Dominating handshakes give off micro pecker vibes to me
[4:27:17] chrisiirc: i think even putting that much thought into peoples handshakes comes off insecure KEKW
[4:27:19] elpmeme: handshake ability correlates with reach around skill so always good to get a measure
[4:27:24] ivoryghost_: is it me, or is the stream sound pretty quiet?

[4:29:23] elpmeme: @laalaaland22 dont be toxic
[4:29:23] chrisiirc: next expansion
[4:29:25] style5z: I find the stream quiet too, I have hi-fi headphones and an amp and it's all on full. Spotify for example is deafening but the stream is like, reasonable
[4:29:58] ivoryghost_: @laalaaland22 yeah its twice as far up as normal on the interface, but it sounds as normal. but now my discord notifications are jump scares
[4:30:27] heymomimonttv: my discord is dummy low today too. had to triple the volume from normal
[4:30:35] heymomimonttv: sorry, twitch not discord

[4:38:14] rekt1370: atleast monk gets kited
[4:38:16] rekt1370: and cced easy
[4:38:29] gamer_dad_01: Kappa
[4:38:30] chrisiirc: dh will hate the extra root damage withstanding
[4:38:47] Shezzmou: imagine being crazy damage wise and never the kill target unless there's a rogue
[4:39:13] rekt1370: yea blur is just ridiculous
[4:39:31] rekt1370: blur for any melee or hunter so low of a cd no point in focusing them
[4:39:53] rekt1370: fear auto breaks on damage dont think it will be that huge
[4:39:55] maxdoesmath: can you share the name of your missive barrage WA? I like the visual
[4:40:02] ariacy: Do you think locks will basically have a pseudo stun they can triple spam?
[4:40:05] eineskog97: will SWD even break fears now?
[4:40:06] gamer_dad_01: rukiMad rukiMad
[4:40:31] eMBeaR64oz: tryin to think what comps are gonna be cracked tues, im thinking dh dk (but dk can die), splay, arcane outlaw, mld, dh ele
[4:40:50] rekt1370: jungle might be moving up also with changes
[4:40:53] ivoryghost_: @eineskog97 running the self dmg reduction talent might just gimp yourself now indeed
[4:41:07] chrisiirc: does ele come out ahead in anyway?
[4:41:18] chrisiirc: maybe just root-wise
[4:41:19] eMBeaR64oz: they get to keep their armor
[4:41:19] Malgaroth: All non wizard players crying feel so good
[4:41:39] rekt1370: im on my hunter let the wizards rise :)
[4:41:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomkin might get torn up by rogues
[4:41:47] iplaygames989: because math is hard
[4:41:59] Malgaroth: Yeah it's like 5% damage reduction I think I saw, but at the end of the dk and dh just hit magic
[4:42:02] rekt1370: feel like hunters got the biggest buff with these changes
[4:42:09] rekt1370: more stam more damage to plate dk nerfs
[4:42:15] hulkdieselx: i started queueing my 2nd lock this week. literally every team but 1 or 2 was a double melee cleave until 1800, then it seemed to die down
[4:42:20] sourbutts: warlocks will bully hunters after weds
[4:42:29] rekt1370: nah hunters eat clothies
[4:42:36] chrisiirc: if you cant beat them, join them
[4:42:36] rekt1370: as any spec
[4:42:38] pugulus_prime: Healing priests get the biggest buff. More armor more stam.
[4:43:02] rekt1370: oh yea other than holy priest
[4:43:07] allenlondon210: will the plate armor thing hurt holy paladin a lot?
[4:43:14] rekt1370: yea going to hurt pally
[4:43:33] rekt1370: holy pally and resto sham biggest weakness was getting trained by melee cleave
[4:43:37] Delxenyo: Which class will benefit the most from the plate armor nerf rogues or hunters?
[4:43:38] FinkleTheMage: Just got here, how's it goin Ven?
[4:43:39] eainzsp: i think dk might feel it a bit
[4:43:49] nuggetzwarr123: are you going to dust off the RETbuki
[4:44:04] rekt1370: hunters will benefit the most from physical

[4:52:22] rekt1370: arcane is just insane
[4:52:23] Itankarenas: Arcane is better, frost is more fun
[4:52:33] waterfeesh: i was having fun on arcane until i kept facing hunter
[4:52:54] waterfeesh: hunter seems crazy again

[4:56:22] ezmoney3434: no offense meant just stating facts, my fault lol

[4:58:55] Somanie: @Itankarenas tbf she's 80 and she just does chill raids and M+ and stuff haha
[4:59:01] metajutsu: @Itankarenas no one likes playing something they're bad at, its pretty self-explanatory lol
[4:59:14] terrible_cereal: wowgrandma is goated for sure
[4:59:16] Itankarenas: @chrye_xx it's crazy seeing people comment on reddit posts and official forums about how they wish pvp would die and that it's a shitty minigame
[4:59:18] rekt1370: LUL
[4:59:32] Itankarenas: @Somanie i mean others, not her. she's 80 so it's fair
[4:59:41] Somanie: @Itankarenas ahhh

[5:04:43] Cdenzy: what big buffs is jungle getting
[5:04:56] rekt1370: well they both do physical damage so do more damage to plate
[5:05:00] allenlondon210: mages kryptonite hunters
[5:05:06] metajutsu: hunters benefit a lot from root dmg increase
[5:05:08] rekt1370: they nerfed dks and rogues which is the biggest counters for hunters
[5:05:22] rekt1370: and the stam increase is big for hunters and ferals cause they squishy
[5:05:30] dooshken: should cyclone be 5 or 4 seconds?
[5:05:33] allenlondon210: I’ve been trying feral but I swear they look at me and I die
[5:06:05] BaWbEY: FERAL FRENZY
[5:06:07] dooshken: seems to me like even 5 seconds is a lot for cyclone

[5:06:11] BaWbEY: WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH
[5:06:12] RedeemedbyJesus: Does my furnace seraph tier set from last season still work in arena?
[5:06:35] Cdenzy: @rekt1370 not sure i would call that big buffs for jungle cause its effecting everyone
[5:06:37] soothingmistmonk: Feral seems so clunky to play in the sense that you have to clone a lot to get damage off.
[5:06:38] allenlondon210: reacher
[5:06:46] DoYouWannaHug: Severance on Apple TV
[5:06:46] ZealotryTV: the man in the high castle on prime

[5:07:00] Somanie: if you haven't seen Dream House with Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz, it's good af
[5:07:14] allenlondon210: @grieveztv lmfao
[5:07:18] rekt1370: @Cdenzy plate armor reduced is nice too they both full physical damage
[5:07:21] Gahunda: oh man GARBANZO is in da house!
[5:07:26] Gahunda: epic mage plays
[5:07:34] Cdenzy: @rekt1370 idk guess we will see i just think these changes are dumb and dont change much at all
[5:07:45] rekt1370: the dk nerfs will feel it
[5:07:54] rekt1370: like their 3 main damage buttons nerfed
[5:07:55] xoHOLLOW: @rekt1370 its actually more of a buff for dks honestly since longer games tend to favor them. dks really thrive in dampening. and i dont think the dmg nerfs are gonna be enough. the armor nerf is also largely irrelevant imo
[5:07:56] waterfeesh: Anyone know how to adjust the camera sensitivity?
[5:07:58] psykuu: @venruki  watch "Poor Things" it's decent:)
[5:08:00] Cdenzy: Yeah maybe dks and rets
[5:08:01] waterfeesh: I cant find it anywhere
[5:08:10] Cdenzy: feel like rets are gonna be insane
[5:08:17] rekt1370: @xohollow  35 percent less armor dont think is irrelevant
[5:08:23] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Reythewrecker WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[5:08:23] waterfeesh: Someone halp D:

[5:08:32] Reythewrecker: Reythewrecker subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! miss me with ads
[5:08:39] rekt1370: rest of the buttons they buffed isn't even their top 5 damage
[5:08:52] Cdenzy: final verdict?
[5:09:00] rekt1370: yea the 10 percent verdict buff is it
[5:09:07] rekt1370: blade of justice buff is bad
[5:09:16] rekt1370: blade of justice hits like a wet noodle
[5:09:19] allenlondon210: it is a armor loss but I’d think the stam buff would help some
[5:09:26] xoHOLLOW: @rekt1370 we'll just run bloodforged into things like warr/ww/hunt/feral since doomburst is indirectly nerfed from the stam buffs. i dont think its as impactful as you think
[5:09:28] rekt1370: rets losing armor isn't good either
[5:09:43] Badasti: bro that druid flying around like a maniac XD
[5:09:52] rekt1370: @xohollow  you guys do that now and die lol they got their damage decently nerfed also
[5:10:25] Gahunda: nice full send
[5:10:38] Gahunda: they really wanted u
[5:10:49] taaitos: How will mage/warlock be after patch?
[5:10:50] Badasti: it was hilarious to  watch an antelope flying across the screen
[5:11:04] rekt1370: mage lock only getting way better after reset
[5:11:14] taaitos: What's happening to them?
[5:11:21] Gahunda: Ven I’m so mad, mage got no buffs in the recent patch
[5:11:23] rekt1370: cloth armor buffs root and fear buffs
[5:11:25] QqmoreTV: good rise against
[5:11:30] allenlondon210: wonder if the changes will give spriest an opportunity to cast more lol
[5:11:31] rekt1370: more stam for locks is big
[5:11:52] Gahunda: blazing barrier is still nerfed rofl
[5:11:55] rekt1370: spriest still going to be struggling
[5:11:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mage got more armor and stamina
[5:11:57] abruptdecayO_O: its a good movie tbh

[5:21:20] zerx_gg: Idk
[5:21:22] Somanie: my mom only drinks diet mtn dew and she's never had a kidney stone so that tracks
[5:21:26] waterfeesh: @smoothytoothy CoolStoryBob
[5:21:34] bigolemooseknuckle: Poor water intake the biggest reason
[5:21:45] laalaaland22: oh god Aware

[5:21:59] smoothytoothy: @waterfeesh HUHH
[5:22:00] Somanie: my cat has chronic kidney stones too, that's why I had to drug him a couple times the other day KEKW
[5:22:08] Somanie: gotta keep the fluids going for him
[5:22:10] gamer_dad_01: coffee beer alot of shti has it in there
[5:22:17] zerx_gg: its so sad for kitties
[5:22:24] bigolemooseknuckle: so many people I know drink about half as much as they should and are chronically dehydrated
[5:22:33] theodeth: i drink a couple of liters of coffee a day
[5:22:40] DrWarz: U THINK tmorrow changes will be enough to make wow playable again? for low rated pvp
[5:22:48] waterfeesh: @smoothytoothy @soothingmistmonk got you two confused
[5:22:56] waterfeesh: Somehow
[5:22:56] chancywilson: i drink like 4 coffees a day but theyre like 4 scoops for coffee all black
[5:22:57] buttercps: i've never drank coffee before
[5:23:02] gamer_dad_01: idk how people cant stand it black. its soo bitter

[5:23:09] chancywilson: bitter the better
[5:23:15] chancywilson: once u go black u never go back
[5:23:17] ZealotryTV: black coffee tastes like burnt cigarettes in water
[5:23:17] Somanie: @zerx_gg he lowkey had a huge vet visit a couple years ago that costed like $3k and required a 3 day vet stay because he had a stone blockage Sadge he's terrified of the vet now (rightfully so)
[5:23:18] zachgamegodx: gotta feel for chunli in tihs call
[5:23:19] theodeth: good coffee isn't bitter black
[5:23:21] sterlingpls: buy an espresso machine, that's how I switched to black coffee
[5:23:22] SweatyDaniels: frckin twavis
[5:23:24] Pock3tsand: has to be a good, dark roast to enjoy black
[5:23:41] gamer_dad_01: maybe i just got to cheap of coffe then
[5:23:51] zerx_gg: BLUBBERS  @Somanie
[5:24:04] bigolemooseknuckle: get some fresh beans, grind them fresh then brew immediately
[5:24:12] bigolemooseknuckle: makes a huge difference
[5:24:28] buckdogx: is arcane best mage spec atm?
[5:24:32] Somanie: @zerx_gg yeah bro o.o spent like $200 on his prescription food today so it doesn't happen again :') sweetest boi ever though, so worth

[5:26:06] zerx_gg: Sorry to hear that Somanie, at least he's doing better now :D
[5:26:12] theodeth: I fetch my beans from the mountains of Peru and roast them before brewing so they're always fresh
[5:26:52] sharpdressedman15: tell us what else you assumed about foxy
[5:27:02] korgare: Dog I have the utmost respect for you listening to Mudvayne.
[5:27:05] sterlingpls: is there a market for kidneystone jewelry?
[5:27:08] waterfeesh: My Standup Starter Pack: Tom Segura - Disgraceful, Shane Gillis - Beautiful Dogs, Bill Burr - I'm Sorry You Feel That Way, Sam Morril - I Got This
[5:27:19] x_Fizzix: @venruki, just saw your three evoker 3v3 arena video with sterge and chun on youtube... absolutely hilarious! Looked like some fun games!
[5:27:25] gamer_dad_01: @sterlingpls idk but i got a couple you could have
[5:27:29] gamer_dad_01: ugly looking things
[5:27:31] dipicat: @levit8TNG facts
[5:27:52] levit8TNG: was just lookin at leaderboard

[5:28:15] waterfeesh: @smoothytoothy Legend
[5:28:20] smoothytoothy: rukiLove
[5:28:28] waterfeesh: @smoothytoothy <3
[5:28:29] korgare: How long have you been listening to Mudvayne for?
[5:28:32] ownagekitty: @venruki Don't you feel frost is out shadowing arcane, even though ever says arcane is better.  I disagree I think frost is top.  What do you think ?
[5:28:42] korgare: I think that song is off the Lost and Found album iir.
[5:29:14] ownagekitty: I mean I think everyone is frost
[5:29:16] primejusticegaming: yoooo what up ven
[5:29:26] ownagekitty: and seems the burst can be better
[5:29:27] primejusticegaming: just tuning in. You plan on trying  Palworld?
[5:29:28] chrye_xx: frost is just easier
[5:29:35] ownagekitty: frost bomb to ray
[5:29:41] waterfeesh: What makes fire bad? Is the burst bad or is it survival? Both??
[5:29:49] chrye_xx: that’s really easier to shut down
[5:29:57] chrye_xx: with a competent team
[5:30:01] byagiza: Do you think frost+healer is as good as lock+healer in 2s?
[5:30:08] Itankarenas: D:
[5:30:08] hipsterdufus: if you get 2400 on one spec can you switch spec and get glad wins?
[5:30:28] apowarri: +
[5:30:39] waterfeesh: I added the authenticator to my account and still cant make arena group posts...
[5:30:41] Itankarenas: @hipsterdufus rating is per spec
[5:30:42] waterfeesh: I got scammed
[5:31:01] Nexz_98: @hipsterdufus no
[5:31:13] hipsterdufus: @Itankarenas I know but you used to be able to get legend wins on a different spec after hitting 2400
[5:31:20] Somanie: @waterfeesh might have to exit game, exit bnet launcher, and reload it for it to register or smth
[5:31:41] waterfeesh: @Somanie I did, maybe it just takes a while
[5:31:55] TimmyShoes: @waterfeesh idk if it's 'bad' per se, just isnt nearly as strong as arcane or frost. less burst less survivabiliy
[5:31:57] itsallrngasf: He knows what to do!
[5:32:04] Itankarenas: @hipsterdufus Interesting.. idk how that would work since each spec has its own rating
[5:32:23] Somanie: @waterfeesh aw :( idk then. have you restarted your computer? that's really the only other idea I have unforch ;-;
[5:32:33] Somanie: if not, it may just happen tomorrow
[5:32:41] hipsterdufus: was just curious because it seems pretty tough to get wins above 2400 atm
[5:32:42] waterfeesh: @Somanie maybe if i reset dns / ip it will work
[5:32:58] itsallrngasf: You guys playing with your m+ friend?
[5:33:04] Itankarenas: oh for 3s yeah
[5:33:10] Itankarenas: I thought he meant shuffle
[5:33:10] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[5:33:23] hipsterdufus: oh I just assumed it was like shuffle
[5:33:38] Itankarenas: nah, they're totally different in rating
[5:34:13] ownagekitty: have you ever stream sniped a friend ven ?
[5:34:15] hipsterdufus: so what if you get 2400 and you queue with some fresh randos so you get placement matches, those will count?
[5:34:17] Itankarenas: EZ crypic typing
[5:34:22] Itankarenas: cryptic* even
[5:34:24] ownagekitty: do tell
[5:34:45] nightmxz: I stream snipe my friend's viewer 2s then kill his teammate and afk out :)

[5:35:10] zachgamegodx: what the heck
[5:35:13] tarth_100: savage
[5:35:16] Itankarenas: that is funny tho
[5:35:30] zachgamegodx: thought you were better than that
[5:35:41] zachgamegodx: it’s all been a lie
[5:35:52] nightmxz: It's really funny and you should bring it back :)
[5:36:09] comfyslayer: how broken are warlocks gonna be

[5:39:33] LordRatigan: Don't make him say it
[5:39:35] zen_oni_shinobi: is that nahj?  sorry i can't remember who that is.
[5:39:36] mollyclive: why arcane is meta atm? feels like frost has so much more survability and same dmg or even more
[5:39:36] dooshken: what does that meme
[5:39:59] itsallrngasf: Give him a cookie ✌️
[5:40:03] hipsterdufus: @TimmyShoes that's probably how he came up with the name actually
[5:40:13] levit8TNG: blizz needs to buff shamans see the state of foxy rn
[5:40:15] pixor74: Is fire dead?
[5:40:52] dooshken: @pixor74 hopefully
[5:41:19] TimmyShoes: @hipsterdufus can you fill me in? i'm actually dumb and don't know. is danny carey the name of a player? or a team?
[5:41:23] Ikkarys03: bro danny carey is fkin beast
[5:41:43] dadb00dy: Watching you play arcane makes me want to try it but i suck
[5:42:59] hipsterdufus: @TimmyShoes his character name is dannycarry so maybe it's a play on danny carey. Not super familiar with tool but I think he's listening to that type of music on stream so he probably knows the name
[5:44:16] waterfeesh: Does frost water ele still have pet nova
[5:46:39] Borngood: sup how's it going today, you recovering okay?
[5:46:40] magnesiium1: yes

[5:51:23] ferahgok: just macro cloak/evasion into dance you'll see instant progress
[5:51:31] ownagekitty: Think it's changed too much and I'm just bad now
[5:52:11] Borngood: -10% wouldve lived
[5:52:24] kalibus1: @ownagekitty its possible, wow has globals so its more about game knowledge and decision making then it is about reaction time

[6:07:23] JmanOwnz: double demo lock
[6:07:23] 0xaxzy: is doublerogue good in retail?
[6:07:28] Salanzo: double demo
[6:07:29] knadam13: rogue mage isnt bad into it
[6:07:29] Somanie: "double rogue" KEKW
[6:07:30] Dwilk20: Demo/Ret?
[6:07:31] nightmxz: Double blood dk
[6:07:33] BingfA: double frost
[6:07:35] renghost22: double rogue 100% counters double rogue... the double rogue team guaranteed to win
[6:07:37] numero5218: rogue dru
[6:07:40] Dwilk20: Tomorrow Demo/Ret/Healer
[6:07:43] DankLloydWright: double demo
[6:07:46] nerdyorc_: Guardian druid/aff
[6:07:53] ButtaTWD: it’s interesting you can’t disintegrate into ams but you can arcane middle
[6:07:55] Hoodwinkel: Is evoker any good atm?
[6:07:57] DankLloydWright: triple guardian druid
[6:07:57] pragma90: feral very good for bleeds, no restealths
[6:08:01] nelly87: gotta love Killswitch
[6:08:01] numero5218: isn’t ret being buffed
[6:08:01] Somanie: I could see ret and maybe an affy ?
[6:08:11] Magottx: Demo warrior hpal?
[6:08:19] waitimdesyncd: yea the cast wont start
[6:08:23] nightmxz: Considered a DoT and you can't apply dots on ams
[6:08:23] tylive52: if you could choose any xpac to compete in other then current which era would it be?
[6:08:23] ButtaTWD: missile*
[6:08:27] nikthevoker: you cant apply disin dot
[6:08:27] Extramediums: pretty sure it's the same with mindflay
[6:08:32] kyaii: You can't ray into ams also
[6:08:33] notoriousztv: ams prevents new dots/negative spell effects, not a bug
[6:08:38] renghost22: it says immune b/c of the slow component, i think
[6:08:38] skydog70: can you channel ray of frost on ams?
[6:08:38] JmanOwnz: other than Druid what healer do you think is the most versatile? (most viable comps they can play)
[6:08:40] skydog70: nvm
[6:08:41] nightmxz: no it's not it's individual hits
[6:08:41] Dwilk20: Cant Mind Flay into AMS
[6:08:49] nightmxz: that's why missiles was insane at proccing essences in BFA
[6:08:52] Dwilk20: pretty sure
[6:08:52] kyaii: it's because it applies magical effect to the target
[6:08:56] kyaii: and missles doesn't
[6:08:58] ButtaTWD: you should be able to crush ams fk that shi
[6:09:05] DankLloydWright: prob because ray/disint are debuffs with a visual effect
[6:09:08] DankLloydWright: and missiles are projectiles
[6:09:16] Extramediums: @Dwilk20 this^^ @ButtaTWD
[6:09:18] ungryniko: i feel like i should be able to flameshock on ams but w/e
[6:09:19] waitimdesyncd: you can bug out deep breath too by lag switching, as it is a BUFF not an ability, so you will hit ALL deepbreath ticks on the same spot, which can oneshot anyone. Mes saw it happen a week ago
[6:09:35] waitimdesyncd: it will make you stuck in the same spot casting deep breath
[6:09:51] Somanie: @waitimdesyncd PepoG mk mk how does one lagswitch
[6:09:59] theoggaillewis: i didnt know you were a blizzcon champ
[6:09:59] MelkonHS: How do you get full comprehension of other classes if you never play them ?
[6:10:05] DankLloydWright: 3s is the best
[6:10:12] waitimdesyncd: @Somanie  either the servers bug out, or your game freezes, or you cheat and lag switch
[6:10:20] DankLloydWright: i play the game to q with friends not roll the dice on shuffles
[6:10:40] Somanie: ohhh word :/ yeah ok I won't cheat KEKW that's wild
[6:11:50] JmanOwnz: that was a crazy clone
[6:12:02] ButtaTWD: fun to watch good arcane mage pov
[6:12:19] Falcanus: did you know what beig is sleepi
[6:12:27] avp46: Exactly
[6:12:31] MelkonHS: must feel good to get carried cuz u semi-light-famous
[6:12:38] Falcanus: you know what it stands for
[6:12:41] Falcanus: youll laugh
[6:12:47] JmanOwnz: other than Druid what healer do you think is the most versatile? (most viable comps they can play)
[6:12:52] Falcanus: "best evoker in game"
[6:13:15] Atlas62: how are mws rn
[6:13:19] Locturnal_TV: prob pres
[6:13:33] pragma90: @Atlas62 have you seen any during the stream
[6:13:34] JmanOwnz: yea me neither I was thinking h pal but maybe im way off on that
[6:13:39] JmanOwnz: pres sounds interesting
[6:14:27] Atlas62: @pragma90 good point
[6:14:37] Somanie: @JmanOwnz hpala is like.. not mid, but not S tier, it's somewhere in between there. pres is amazing most of the time, but there are comps in which pres is dogshit
[6:15:03] Somanie: disc priest might be super versatile, but imo there's a little learning curve to disc
[6:15:08] chrye_xx: you’re playing shimmer into this omg
[6:15:17] ownagekitty: I think fistweaver any mele 2s is op played against dh fistweaver
[6:15:19] JmanOwnz: @somanie that’s totally fair and I’m definitely fine with it being a solid A, and not S. just want the option to play with as many peeps as possible
[6:15:20] Hyutra: @chrye_xx Gigachad
[6:15:23] rekt1370: isn't disc the easiest healer
[6:15:27] chrye_xx: @hyutra hella
[6:15:27] Cdenzy: @venruki who did u get vengeful glad with?
[6:15:35] avp46: That fake sheep on priest was nince :D
[6:15:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: SMOrc SMOrc
[6:16:19] flyingorangee: blink stun is such sleeper
[6:16:37] gelatokush: yo the new expel harm on fw is kinda good man, if i sphere myself + most healing mod up and expel harm, i redirect 419k non crit dmg on pvp dummy
[6:16:37] Somanie: @JmanOwnz that's fair!! keep an eye on like PvP healer tier lists and stuff after the plate/armor changes tomorrow, but I don't think it'll make too too much of a difference
[6:16:55] Somanie: (I love rdruid a whole lot tho)
[6:17:00] ItsBees: aww poor rogues
[6:17:05] nerdyorc_: hopefully its every time
[6:17:06] 0xaxzy: i dont hate u
[6:17:07] Nateypww: I love venruki
[6:17:14] jporter_: dude close poll
[6:17:15] sethv805: the whole forum talks about you. (usually not good)
[6:17:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: The guardian druid people hate Venruki, too
[6:17:18] flyingorangee: and who likes rogue players KEKW Keepo
[6:17:19] rekt1370: ven been getting rets gutted then rogues
[6:17:24] hoopscotch: hope everyone is well
[6:17:25] rekt1370: ven making enemies everywhere
[6:17:27] Somanie: Kappa
[6:17:29] hoopscotch: yes i still have a job
[6:17:44] chrye_xx: ret should be deleted from WoW
[6:17:52] hoopscotch: yep
[6:17:53] JmanOwnz: @somanie I really appreciate the advice and I’ll definitely do that. decided to main healer just so I could play the game more. I have a priest, monk, and pally already 70 so was leaning toward those 3
[6:17:54] Extramediums: wtf
[6:18:04] Extramediums: and I'd bet the ceo got a raise this year too
[6:18:12] hoopscotch: 530, 11%
[6:18:12] taylorperiod: getting replaced by AI
[6:18:17] rekt1370: thats massive but why
[6:18:21] rekt1370: oooo
[6:18:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Someone had to get those specs nerfed, Venruki just took one for the team
[6:18:28] rekt1370: ah its nice more money for the ceos LUL
[6:18:35] Chappypappy1: riot mmmooooo
[6:18:40] varok87: What recession?
[6:18:41] hoopscotch: https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/2024-player-update
[6:18:46] Somanie: @JmanOwnz I forgot about mw!! mw is also pretty cool, but again rdruid has my heart 5ever. if you've never tried rdruid, it's amazing but you have to make sure to maintain HoTs preemptively
[6:18:51] hulkdieselx: @varok87 ???????????
[6:18:55] mvqq: Pretty cool they made a massive post explaining the reason behind it

[6:19:29] Extramediums: Benjamin Yi       Executive Chairman, Director   $21,498,549  2022
[6:19:38] JmanOwnz: @somanie yea I feel like I should just bite the bullet and level/boost one. I also like 2s a lot so rdruid would be clutch in that as well
[6:19:39] mvqq: Seems like it's Legends of Runeterra thats just a failure
[6:19:44] Daynnight28: They specifically say in it they're not doing it to satisfy shareholders or hit quotas LUL  uhuh
[6:19:44] Somanie: hit em with the receipts, Extramediums
[6:19:45] mvqq: and that's where theyre cutting costs
[6:19:51] mvqq: its their card game
[6:19:57] rekt1370: card game OMEGALUL
[6:19:59] swaeex: card game
[6:19:59] mvqq: thats what the post says
[6:20:01] DankLloydWright: its too bad, because that game rules
[6:20:07] mvqq: "As Legends of Runeterra continues its journey, we’re making changes to move the game toward sustainability."
[6:20:19] rekt1370: their mmo will pop off
[6:20:32] swaeex: it'll be mid
[6:20:36] rekt1370: its riot and league universe so prob
[6:20:39] rekt1370: be popular regardless
[6:20:42] hoopscotch: the project i was working on has been sunset as well
[6:20:43] mvqq: their mmo will come out in 2030 or something
[6:20:44] rekt1370: even if its mid
[6:20:45] zerx_gg: for a week, then everyone's going back to league
[6:20:46] jporter_: im definitely playing it
[6:20:47] Extramediums: LOL, my bad, that was a different 'riot'

[6:30:59] taylorperiod: @Robofat Imrealgay
[6:31:00] Itankarenas: @Robofat you should see the duo he plays with sometimes
[6:31:18] TimmyShoes: @Robofat there seem to be a lot of names like this in the elite bracket. i think it's a troll/pychological warfare. it's bad to lose to a DK with a random name, but losing to a DK with that name? stings a lil more.
[6:31:19] Somanie: @Luigicamp do you know where? :O

[6:36:19] fizgaroth1: Stupid question, but I'm new here - have you ever been to R1? Every pvp streamer has it written 10 times in the title, if there was one, but I don't see it on yours
[6:36:19] dakotan517: did legs for like 3hours one night then couldnt walk for afew days first time trying
[6:36:31] Tragictomb: blood ain’t thicker than the m+ score
[6:36:33] nikthevoker: "suure"
[6:36:34] zerx_gg: I think he lost count fizgaroth1
[6:36:42] TimmyShoes: he lowkey sounds like he knows what meth is like
[6:36:50] turkeybaster9: Is this Joe Rogan?
[6:36:51] Hotrecki: NO Explode?
[6:36:56] dakotan517: isnt that why pj braun went to jail
[6:36:58] bigolemooseknuckle: Jamie pull that up
[6:37:02] dakotan517: something similar
[6:37:05] SweatyDaniels: pretty sure you cant legally put meth in supplements
[6:37:06] grandrasen: ask him about his dmt trip
[6:37:08] nikthevoker: they dont look until they have a reason to
[6:37:28] Xenic0501: What's up Ven
[6:37:28] Itankarenas: Jamie, look up meth and crack in pre workout
[6:37:29] ItsBees: What would be a good 2's partner for rdruid?
[6:37:38] zerx_gg: twice huh? addict
[6:37:42] ImJordanHi: Just buy Thorne, best company one of the only that the Olympics allows
[6:37:44] MorcsXL: careful this is close to TOS
[6:37:52] imrobk: delta 8 is hemp derived.
[6:37:52] mvqq: xD no its not relax @EatFreshXL
[6:37:54] ItsBees: I just want this mount LUL
[6:38:00] JmanOwnz: idk if you heard but that’s why Johnson n Johnson changed their name to Kenvue. basically they proved their baby powder was causing cancer
[6:38:06] rembrandt89: its just cbd im pretty sure
[6:38:11] fizgaroth1: @SweatyDaniels In my country, some time ago, pre-workout supplements containing an amphetamine derivative were legal LUL
[6:38:14] Magottx: promoting dh rdru 2s should be tos
[6:38:19] sethv805: I wouldn’t worry about TOS. just don’t pull a lordmuffinrat
[6:38:22] soothingmistmonk: @foxyllama when is your next drinking stream?
[6:38:25] wow_revan: @venruki Do you have a song for Mage? I had a lot of fun when you started singing to the green evoker :)
[6:38:39] Xenic0501: As a frost mage how often do you use frostbolt?
[6:38:48] SweatyDaniels: delta 8 is piss
[6:39:11] JmanOwnz: s1 dragonflight glad mount was so clean
[6:39:14] zerx_gg: what a chune
[6:39:16] Skydre360: @sethv805 what did he do? lol
[6:39:19] TimmyShoes: @EatFreshXL twitch has thots in hot tubs smoking joints and borderline showing off the b-hole...but they would TOS a conversation about pre-workout because venruki isn't in a bikini.
[6:39:47] MaybeRespect: @TimmyShoes 2024 baby
[6:40:07] MaybeRespect: @TimmyShoes Reality is whatever you make it!
[6:41:26] i11danzo: lol foxy saying i meld it but he is tauren
[6:41:43] i11danzo: love that guy
[6:42:15] skydog70: mightve been his necro wound heal
[6:42:20] Dourme: what are the best dps to heal as a MW monk in 3s?
[6:42:28] MaybeRespect: Deathstrike + Necro pop
[6:42:32] MaybeRespect: Good timing
[6:42:48] jporter_: isnt it a pvp talent?
[6:42:51] mmarkers: hover over the icon
[6:42:53] dipicat: nice passive
[6:42:58] mvqq: he prob used apocalypse and procced a lot of wounds
[6:43:00] Scioman: pvp talent, nerfed soon
[6:43:01] soothingmistmonk: Its an absorb
[6:43:12] Caedalade: Death Knight =D
[6:43:14] Scioman: nerfed down to 3%
[6:43:17] MaybeRespect: 15 sec debuff. Stacks to 6 based on wounds. And heals you based on how much the target was healed.
[6:43:26] IGna7iusIV: "up to 4% max health" but hits for 400k?
[6:43:33] zerx_gg: "stacks up to 6 times"
[6:43:34] dipicat: nerfed but overall % hp getting buffed so
[6:43:36] dipicat: not gonna change much
[6:43:45] IGna7iusIV: ah
[6:43:46] MaybeRespect: It can heal very little, all depends on how much target was healed
[6:43:59] Borngood: dont dk have higher max hp?
[6:44:02] Badasti: did it crit or smth?
[6:44:07] firemarcosrl: @Borngood it does
[6:44:10] i11danzo: and maybe bm trinket
[6:44:14] Borngood: 24% of like 1.3 mil?
[6:44:19] Borngood: idk
[6:45:07] MaybeRespect: Problem with necro wounds is you can't time it. It can proc when your 100% hp already
[6:45:10] xmrdojox: Ven what do you think is the top 2s healer other than Rdruid
[6:45:12] jporter_: dude how many dhdk
[6:45:55] ezprit07: @xmrdojox Fistweaver
[6:46:30] mmarkers: easiest comp to push rating with atm. Easy strat (do damage) and strong @jporter_
[6:46:35] mmarkers: super popular
[6:46:38] mashyret: ResidentSleeper
[6:46:54] mashyret: wait can you queue up without being dh or dk in this game?
[6:47:03] MaybeRespect: @mmarkers Easy huh. 2.4 still top 1%
[6:47:03] kyleeonpc: What is the state of pvp right now? i haven't played since DF launch
[6:47:13] conman_91: it’s been the same people too jeff
[6:47:22] dakotan517: nah its bad
[6:47:26] dakotan517: i heard caster meta
[6:47:26] arcane_p: hey venruki, you feeling better today?
[6:47:30] mashyret: looks weak. dk's only doing twice my lay on hands every strike. should be quadruple.
[6:47:46] ZeroKelviin: @MaybeRespect Bro 2.4 is still like 0.3% rank 1 is 2.6 lol
[6:47:56] MaybeRespect: @ZeroKelviin Exactly :P
[6:48:14] Locturnal_TV: do they usually swell when youre sick?
[6:48:16] ZeroKelviin: DF had the potential to be the best pvp expac in a long many years and flopped harder than SL
[6:48:21] arcane_p: well glad your feeling somewhat better
[6:48:51] Cvarks: ring of fire buff tomorrow!
[6:49:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: @ZeroKelviin By flop you mean that Dragonflight has some of the highest sub retention in a long, long time
[6:49:45] xkayne: isnt there a saying "feed a cold, starve the flu"
[6:50:10] MaybeRespect: @wEiRdO_dUdE He means pvp participation very low sir.
[6:50:16] SingularitySeven: new tier list video this week?
[6:50:25] ZeroKelviin: @wEiRdO_dUdE i mean its terrible for me personally and from a pvp PoV but great for PvE and casual players which explains sub retention
[6:50:28] pure__goat: dh just can extend there meta form
[6:50:49] pure__goat: with fury spent
[6:50:51] TimmyShoes: chevelle is an underrated band

[6:52:51] Dwilk20: You min-maxing your Inertia Buff?
[6:53:12] mashyret: have you considered the dh is just the most advanced class in the game?
[6:53:16] Extramediums: ww monk kinda squish after karma

[6:54:12] Reiumi_: monkaW
[6:56:19] Reiumi_: KEKW
[6:56:20] taylorperiod: HAHAHA

[6:56:24] taylorperiod: foxy's funny
[6:56:24] Gahunda: chat, did blizzard give approx respective years of release for the announced 3 expansions?
[6:56:28] mashyret: there it is

[6:57:08] rockiyo: the vigor frame bug again
[6:57:11] chrye_xx: blink angle? 🤔
[6:57:31] Extramediums: @venruki I think your problem with DH is you're overthinking it. Play like it's tbc, and you're like 12 years old
[6:57:33] Hotrecki: I saw immo aura explode and essence break same time when you got smacfked
[6:57:39] Extramediums: seriously
[6:58:28] Badasti: why can this dozy batman class jump out of ring
[6:58:38] MaybeRespect: @Extramediums Kinda true. LOL
[6:58:40] soothingmistmonk: Anyone know the addon to show how many clear casting charges he has?
[6:59:22] Badasti: @soothingmistmonk probably a weakaura
[6:59:28] Badasti: i track them with a weakaura
[7:01:39] llamasweater192837: Nice cs
[7:01:50] crackedtrades: What arenas frames addon are you using? My gladius is bugged not sure if theres anothe rone
[7:02:01] zerx_gg: sArena
[7:02:05] crackedtrades: ty
[7:02:16] gamerdadhooper: hi ven do you already have the S3 glad mount?
[7:02:23] PeptoAbysmal: sarena bugs for me too so i swapped to gladiusex
[7:02:31] Scioman: ask healer what he did when he said he did mistake
[7:02:38] cam_ham1: hes at 36/50
[7:02:43] wow_revan: Dragonflight Gladius (Bicmex Version) it work perfectly right now, no glitch.
[7:02:43] MaybeRespect: You love mage/lock metas? Actually
[7:02:44] Dwilk20: Venruki do you use the DOUBLE Mastery Embelishments on your DH?
[7:02:46] cam_ham1: hes tracking the ach
[7:02:49] Badasti: why are mages going to be broken? this is news to me LUL

[7:03:02] Ey_an: and its always good
[7:03:03] Ey_an: sucks
[7:03:06] panika_gg: and rdru
[7:03:07] famous1939: so true
[7:03:08] MaybeRespect: yeah agreed
[7:03:16] Lemurion1: why?
[7:03:16] Moobot: Latest video "PvP Rewards Are Still Too Hard To Get In Dragonflight, Data Shows" view it here: youtu.be/NSw9Imk5bec
[7:03:24] MaybeRespect: Cleave meta is rough, but atleast not boring 15 min games.
[7:03:31] potatolockx: demo/frost/rdruid ResidentSleeper
[7:03:37] xoHOLLOW: no ven you have to be the ret paladin hating, wizard comp loving villain that reddit portrays you as
[7:03:42] heavymetal_warrior: ur video is blowing up on the US forums :D
[7:03:44] arcane_p: What is your favorite Meta venruki?
[7:04:04] Nachofez: people are hella stupid
[7:04:05] PeptoAbysmal: damn
[7:04:06] ihavesmokedcrack: lol
[7:04:06] Steff_988: what video? :D i wanna see it
[7:04:06] MaybeRespect: LOL
[7:04:10] wow_revan: Venruki love evoker too :)
[7:04:13] heavymetal_warrior: dw about em, ur the best bro <3
[7:04:16] stonedmonkey: why be a mage... when you could be a boomy!
[7:04:17] Dreddmar: thats pretty funny im sorry lmao
[7:04:26] Badasti: i dont understand though, what did people get triggered by
[7:04:26] JmanOwnz: everyone is a critic. you’re doing god’s work Ven
[7:04:26] ihavesmokedcrack: hahaha
[7:04:30] smitesucks: a lot of forum posters have mental illness
[7:04:33] heavymetal_warrior: good music too
[7:04:38] Magottx: lol that’s funny
[7:04:43] luvix07: How's frost feel ven? :)
[7:04:43] mattyb_23: Melee caster healer is how it should always be
[7:04:45] endtrip_: theyre callin you soft bro
[7:04:46] Lemurion1: i prefer long games where i actually get to play, rather then step inside arena and been 100-0 in 1 sec by eviscerate
[7:04:48] MaybeRespect: He's basically calling you weird/sensitive. Idk how he got that out of the video though.
[7:04:50] levit8TNG: i think it just means youre kinda nerdy not as mean as it sounds
[7:04:58] flashvau: cs blink kill
[7:05:04] Magottx: Bro he’s commenting on forums…. I have a feeling he’s not the most alpha human
[7:05:10] arcane_p: Nahj made the point that blizzard should change 3s arena to only allow melee caster healers to Q that the game is better that way, your thoughts?
[7:05:43] MaybeRespect: @arcane_p Would have to make some serious class changes to allow viability.
[7:05:52] arcane_p: you think?
[7:05:58] flashvau: hard enough to get ques without restricting what comps u can play
[7:06:16] arcane_p: that's true @flashvau
[7:06:36] mrshowtyme: Nahj would say that cause he probably hates double caster lol kind of clown take.
[7:06:37] Spawrro: don't need restrictions, just need more frequent balance changes
[7:06:45] arcane_p: I think that's what would make it bad but otherwise I think it wouldn't be so bad
[7:07:08] MaybeRespect: @Spawrro What we need is a long-term / (not near sighted) vision of pvp, then weekly/biweekly changes to achieve it.
[7:07:47] Lemurion1: instead of making cata, mop, wod classic blizzard needs to focus on getting the main game better, so that people actually wanna play instead, increasing layer base
[7:07:57] Lemurion1: player*
[7:08:02] heavymetal_warrior: ohh nice bullet for my valentine. Saw them the other day :D
[7:08:24] nikthevoker: holy shit
[7:10:32] Nachofez: W foxy
[7:10:40] 0bsury: Hey Venruki, could you please give me the macro to cast Arcane Blast out of range ? and use tp ? :)
[7:10:59] lebrun_james_: chuns mic is a lil low
[7:11:02] heavymetal_warrior: ohhh gg
[7:11:18] lebrun_james_: appreciate it
[7:11:32] Cdenzy: think he means shimmer?
[7:11:45] 0bsury: yes sorry but i see in the video of palumor burst

[7:12:42] nystrall: any word on whether Jah can compete?
[7:12:43] stopeating: where can I find your comp specs
[7:12:53] MaybeRespect: I wish they would do conquest like the did honor. I really hate the RNG boxes @bradenschuh1

[7:14:14] Cdenzy: rogue mains
[7:14:15] halfwaythug: TwitchConHYPE
[7:14:18] stonedmonkey: foxy has a point...

[7:14:21] Badasti: breakin poor foxy's balls
[7:14:25] mashyret: RET MAINS >
[7:14:26] FKNweebstv: lontarJAM
[7:14:27] MaybeRespect: Nah, biggest victim is rogue. They always think their class sucks
[7:14:37] MaybeRespect: Even when they 1 shot people in cheapshot
[7:14:38] toxicvenom406: coming back after a long break, what’s had to make a new account.
[7:14:43] zachgamegodx: earthen is rly good situationally
[7:14:47] mashyret: i was hearing rets complain during s1 retpocalypse

[7:15:34] sw0o0o0osh: yo ven do you think locks will rise on tuesday?
[7:15:51] mashyret: nerfing rsham armor is gonna save the game
[7:15:54] Mortammer: what are you running for stat percents?
[7:16:05] theodeth: you're right, buff rogues
[7:16:10] yesterday_potato: too much dam
[7:16:13] Salanzo: are u casting awc
[7:16:21] mashyret: rogue buffs could save the game on top of that rsham armor nerf
[7:16:45] Badasti: rogue buffs wot
[7:16:45] MaybeRespect: I think rogues armor should be buffed to plate. *shrug*
[7:17:39] Vigi9413: are treants just up all the time
[7:17:41] varok87: Sheesh that 1 shot jesus
[7:17:45] MakuuuTV: can you show death recap of that dh
[7:17:46] theodeth: nice lol
[7:18:15] Nachofez: foxy is the goat
[7:18:20] Nachofez: hella funny
[7:18:28] Xeliumimar: not get ran over
[7:18:34] nystrall: not get mowed by cleaves
[7:18:46] kellydean_: just saw the class tuning. DK gonna be rough
[7:19:04] ECH0F0XTR0T: Do you have your frost mage macros posted anywhere? Besides the typical poly/CS ones
[7:19:05] MakuuuTV: it doesn't matter who you press surge on right? its not like magi?
[7:19:09] RuthlessAP: BOOMKIN
[7:19:09] arcane_p: they need to give us another school of magic as arcane
[7:19:11] Xeliumimar: set up your FDK :)
[7:19:11] style5z: can you find anymore 3s?
[7:19:14] jfachal: triple dragon
[7:19:16] Ey_an: healer
[7:19:16] Scioman: play dk =)
[7:19:18] Xeliumimar: oo do holy priest shuffles
[7:19:22] Fakez_: arcane would be busted if the meta wasnt high mobility high damage dps with 3 micro ccs each
[7:19:22] Vigi9413: play shuffle on something you haven’t played in awhile
[7:19:23] chewyzxd: find mroe 3s
[7:19:28] Recyclemanx: 3s with snutz and cdew
[7:19:28] sw0o0o0osh: ret pally now
[7:19:28] arcane_p: arcane is completely frustrating when you get kicked
[7:19:31] zen_oni_shinobi: game release news if queues are long?
[7:19:32] griffithismydaddy: sod hardcore
[7:19:40] i11danzo: warm up on holy
[7:19:40] famous1939: i played some hpriest last night to enjoy tomm even more
[7:19:54] nerfurface: healer shuff
[7:19:56] Zaiyge: yeah thats fine
[7:19:57] levit8TNG: i only play hpriest
[7:19:57] Cvarks: it should be with how oppressive it is when its played right
[7:19:57] ObbTheKnob: Yes
[7:19:58] SplitViewAskew: of course
[7:19:58] famous1939: yeah cant have everything equal
[7:20:01] Yoseirl: yes, feels more rewarding personally
[7:20:02] arcane_p: yea but I think that since its so hard to play it should be as strong as sub rogue
[7:20:02] Outer_Limitz: as long as there is easier specs to compensate
[7:20:03] Badasti: i think its ok, i prefer playing hard to master classes
[7:20:04] Hotrecki: all classes should be 1-2 buttons
[7:20:06] tikdoks: let’s do some green lizard or pooper healing
[7:20:08] Locturnal_TV: thats fine as long as they dont get to be the best spec in the game every season, every expansion, for a decade
[7:20:12] Essalxx: What healer is strong with thundercleave?
[7:20:12] SplitViewAskew: i cant play frost mage for the life of me and i like that
[7:20:15] stopeating: r sham
[7:20:15] Badasti: feels like more of an achievement when you do stuff
[7:20:18] arcane_p: with all the cc in the game arcane is super hard
[7:20:30] Magottx: Yea I like that a lot
[7:20:34] Locturnal_TV: talking about ret ofc
[7:20:40] arcane_p: I always just play frost just so I can get my damage off
[7:20:49] mashyret: TRUE
[7:20:52] Hotrecki: play dh
[7:20:54] Nachofez: proccy p time, YES!
[7:21:00] Axtin: should higher difficulty spec = stronger spec
[7:21:07] IIyena: solo arcane
[7:21:08] tikdoks: That mog on lizard is going hard
[7:21:09] sw0o0o0osh: yeaah lets get dh
[7:21:12] arcane_p: @axtin YES
[7:21:18] Lemurion1: or devoker, i wanna learn :)
[7:21:19] style5z: no but it should be rewarding to do it well
[7:21:24] Badasti: i dont like classes being way too easy if they get hella value, but i dont necessarily think that harder should mean that its unreasonably stronger
[7:21:51] tikdoks: haha, love names like that
[7:22:03] Fakez_: harder spec shouldnt be stronger but mindless specs should be as strong as they are
[7:22:58] Kymagez: you look jacked today, white is good on you

[7:25:38] Essalxx: Hello ven! What healer would you recommend as thundercleave?
[7:25:38] Cquil_: !frost
[7:25:38] Nightbot: Frost feels really great since the changes on Jan 10th, damage is really solid for both PvP & PvE. The recent updates didn't change much, glacial is slighly nerfed - ray of frost is decent - frostbolt buffs don't change much.
[7:25:48] Magottx: Damn ven looks yoked
[7:25:57] gamerdadhooper: i gotta head on out ven! have a great stream, see you tommorow!

[7:36:25] Badasti: @elefusions feral needs a rework imo, having to clone constantly to do dam is so clunky
[7:36:29] hamsti: dang that monk melted
[7:36:33] MakuuuTV: @Badasti I agree
[7:36:35] sethgoodtime: sethgoodtime subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Rawr

[7:37:18] biofreaks: Feral druid stocks in the gutter
[7:37:19] Badasti: that warrior lol
[7:37:29] Badasti: getting shoved all ove rthe arena
[7:37:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ele shaman taking a hit like resto did seems fair to me
[7:37:41] Locturnal_TV: they also adjusted warlock fear break
[7:38:00] justjoshingyo: @Locturnal_TV how so
[7:38:20] hamsti: Imagine if hex worked like clone Kreygasm
[7:38:29] Locturnal_TV: Nightmare increases the amount of damage required to cancel Fear by 30% in PvP combat (was 60%).
[7:38:36] Nachofez: a cc that can be spammable and cant break? kind of broken

[7:41:17] MakuuuTV: lol that play
[7:41:49] Lyricise: “Morning coffee with Ven” man. It feels like homage to Reckful, is it? Tea time with Byron.
[7:41:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH and ret dodged any additional changes, so far
[7:42:26] sethgoodtime: clone just needs a cd even if it's like 8 seconds
[7:42:26] michxxlh: ya idk
[7:42:27] Locturnal_TV: pre nerf the patch. shud be okay
[7:42:31] Marshypie: Yeah just did the math locks are losing armor

[7:42:50] dankgamer97: wont it even out ?
[7:42:50] elefusions: Affliction is just catching L's for no reason lol no secondary school of magic and losing armor
[7:42:52] that_man_ski: @Xenic0501 was wondering the same thing
[7:42:58] kickboxer32xd: Demon Skin increases armor by 22.5%/45% in PvP (was 45%/90%).
[7:43:00] kornystreamz: dark pact gets shredded through in 1 global
[7:43:08] tikdoks: doesn’t ghost wolf break roots?
[7:43:10] Spawrro: @mgbanks083 demon armor got nerfed by 50% tho
[7:44:14] mgbanks083: Not seeing the nerf to demon armor in these notes

[7:44:56] mashyret: YOOOOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOO
[7:44:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: The bear form armor nerf hits all the druid specs, I think
[7:45:12] Falcanus: i feel like the shaman 5% healing should apply to pvp too
[7:45:18] gelatokush: boomy lost armor in boomy and bear form interesting
[7:45:21] elefusions: @wEiRdO_dUdE It's all druids yes Feral is going to flop harder than it already does

[8:09:19] StromicusRex: get gaslit, idiot
[8:09:19] Fros365: Interesting
[8:09:23] capi_capi: in Mexico they teach us that America is 1 continent with 3 sections
[8:09:26] tikdoks: haha, they are trolling you. I hope
[8:09:27] ryanblue98: the continent is flat though
[8:09:27] capi_capi: North Central and south

[8:09:54] gelatokush: im sure its true too
[8:09:55] Luigicamp: I am saying it doesn't have to be defined by the continent. If you tell people Nicaragua is in south America they will correct you

[8:10:32] tikdoks: everything is on a continent
[8:10:44] heavymetal_warrior: yo why do they call it the middle east
[8:10:46] fennxy: how is the state of retail
[8:10:49] tarth_100: Continents aren't the only geographical grouping used to group places.
[8:10:59] ryanblue98: #notmycontinent
[8:11:00] Taevenx: wait, Canada isn't a continent?!
[8:11:11] bigolemooseknuckle: Look at a globe and point out which continent Hawaii is on
[8:11:19] StromicusRex: oh no not this one
[8:11:28] Fros365: For hispanic countries North America is Canada, US and Mexico, then From Guatemala to Panama is Central America and the rest is South Amerca

[8:11:53] elmonohombre: thats what a lot of non-americans believe

[8:11:55] arcane_p: United States does not view Canada as "North America"
[8:11:55] capi_capi: u r US citizens
[8:11:59] Extramediums: colonialists gonna colonise
[8:12:00] Pontacos: USA BABY
[8:12:01] Taevenx: the Ret paladins will disagree
[8:12:03] Extramediums: colonize
[8:12:07] StromicusRex: murca
[8:12:07] taylorperiod: @arcane_p what yes they do
[8:12:12] bigolemooseknuckle: it's mostly because you have the word America in the name
[8:12:14] Aquatixlol: Canada needs help big time
[8:12:14] capi_capi: Murica
[8:12:15] bigolemooseknuckle: no other country does

[8:17:24] capi_capi: Meanwhile enjoying playing Mario Wonder like a lil kid
[8:17:27] capi_capi: :D
[8:17:32] B0ost3d: Is emerald blossom worth pressing? i feel like it heals so little
[8:17:52] Gajing: it's a pve heal
[8:17:54] blackheart1110: imagine a mage in this lobby
[8:17:54] Slayer_Eagleone: what even counters mages right now or even after tomrrow??

[8:18:20] doolittle101: Melee vs holy pal feels rough on evo
[8:18:30] Secretwombatbro: it activates a nice selfheal i think with a talent you take to move down the tree
[8:18:32] jporter_: i thiknk ele is good into arcane
[8:18:34] Kymagez: sam is a higher resto than cdew dont listen to chuck
[8:18:38] JustTaki: it buffs something but so does embrace so i guess maybe the dew uses it when going is risky>
[8:19:16] EliteDamit: can use emerald blossom to reset fast living flame, or if you are running ourobouros it is a big aoe heal when 5 stacked :)

[8:22:29] EliteDamit: I think i saw Zenlyn tweet that he gaslights the enemy healer that the dps are flaming them hahaha
[8:22:51] skez_live: whats funny is I came back to wow just playing Disc, since it was something I knew... but after playing hpal and pres evoker... i cant go back hah

[8:28:13] tarth_100: its basically like they didn't get any armor changes
[8:28:15] doolittle101: It's a Joe dirt ref I think @gajing
[8:28:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think ideally, warlocks would see a small armor buff much like other clothies, just not a massive gain like it was looking
[8:28:58] Gajing: oh you may be right, damn i am old, can't remember movies lmao @doolittle101
