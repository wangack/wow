[5:04:56] monkeslol: ‚ÄòBm###
[5:04:56] AaronInternet: Yes, in Classic World of Warcraft, there is a concept called "pull aggro" or "initial aggro" where the first hit against a target generates more threat or aggro than subsequent hits. This means that the player who initiates combat with a mob or boss will typically have a higher threat level than the other members of their party for a short time after the fight begins.
