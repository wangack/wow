[0:22:08] dolanknoob: If fairlife is making you feel like shit, you can buy raw milk at the store like whole foods. I had crohn's and it legit cured me in a week. Pasteurized milk destroys me too.
[0:22:23] zenith_fps: pika i need help finding a main class, i like fast classes with alot of haste and buttons and possibly not cc reliant

[0:38:07] Etereal: I think double DPS no longer works in a 2x2 arena, honestly Blizzard had to do something about it, maybe separate the 2x2 queues, making one queue just for double dps and another for healer and dps, but this would impact the waiting time perhaps

[0:48:44] sonoma121: @Jrexlol both
[0:48:53] ashraf_ma: @Talimill tysm
[0:48:56] peterpaind: you know what the game needs in war withing removal of every god damn addon no joke
[0:49:00] Huntardness: outlaw dh rdruid destro need to be gutted
[0:49:01] crazzbez: arcane mage better get touched
[0:49:03] moistydank: i think dh just needs a solid like damage cd like most classes instead of just doing damage all the time.
[0:49:07] R1_Prototype: vengeful retreat needs a 1 min cooldown
[0:49:08] gooooofy_: did we have any change in pvp ? or not yet announced
[0:49:09] sonoma121: if they nerf dh them game will be even
[0:49:09] moistydank: then it wont be so oppresive
[0:49:12] moistydank: just an idea
[0:49:12] crymorre: every spec should get nerfed except mine tbh
[0:49:19] crackz0r94: what is the name of the song is the background xd
[0:49:32] ibrahamovic: Estoy muy cansado
[0:49:34] Talimill: @crackz0r94 after dark mr kitty
[0:49:36] hero79: as u ever think on play pve content like raid and shit?
[0:49:37] RagingXRob: any noob can play dh/ret but outlaw isnt that oppresive if u are bad
[0:49:40] sonoma121: my vengeful retreat only 20 seconds cooldown no 1 min
[0:49:46] flovin1: this blizzard buff nerf game DansGame
[0:49:47] Amaki_II: They should buff Fistweaver.  caedKektor
[0:50:00] JoordyT: is dh just as bad as when rets had that big buff where everyone climbed with it a few seasons ago?
[0:50:01] sonoma121: @El_Capitan_Live in what world? mine is 20 seconds cooldown
[0:50:06] matt_caste: @moistydank we def shoulda been on that instead of WW Frida
[0:50:09] chrisiirc: hi pika!
[0:50:10] crackz0r94: ty @Talimill
[0:50:14] ashraf_ma: Will you be checking out the hero talents before or after the expansion drops ? @Pikabooirl
[0:50:22] dabaddon: yooo
[0:50:31] Jrexlol: wp
[0:50:34] moistydank: @matt_caste double dh is op lol
[0:50:38] ibrahamovic: @Pikabooirl when am i gonna see you roll sham again
[0:50:39] i_Static: there’s like 6 releases
[0:50:40] Voriq: @crackz0r94 Mr.Kitty - After Dark
[0:50:45] i_Static: released*
[0:50:45] dolanknoob: I think outlaw is alright. Gouge probs need a 5-10 more sec on the CD, otherwise the dmg is fine.
[0:50:54] moistydank: WW is fun but they just die too fast
[0:51:01] matt_caste: @moistydank @moistydank next time, if kurt ever shows up,  idk what happened to kurt, said all he was doing was gamin all weekend, but then only got an hour out of em
[0:51:07] Jrexlol: rogue hero talents released?
[0:51:10] chrisiirc: yeah lol
[0:51:10] sonoma121: is ele worth lvling for pvp?
[0:51:18] vigilantknives: uptime on dh is 100%
[0:51:19] Ryso33: they could just start with somethin quick and blanket like somethin like 10% inc dmg everyone, -10% dh lol
[0:51:20] xhinoc: rogue vs rogue
[0:51:26] CovidiousOG: feral is the master class
[0:51:26] dabaddon: is 3s a possibility tonight?
[0:51:27] chrisiirc: also cause they have such few button their damage per global is disgusting
[0:51:27] i_Static: should I make horde resto shaman orc?
[0:51:33] Ryso33: n go from there, but like how are changes not quicker
[0:51:36] Remelan_: do you play sod at all?
[0:51:40] Ryso33: is there one dev in a closet for pvp
[0:51:41] dolanknoob: I would be happy if they left every class where it's at and just gutted DH. I think it's holding back a lot of mid tier specs from more viability.
[0:51:44] ashraf_ma: DH feels like Fury warrior on crack
[0:51:46] squarepusher_: Any yet didn't get any buffs in the massive class changes a month ago. Odd.
[0:51:54] Remelan_: cause someone is out here named tmpikaboo on shadowstrike lol
[0:51:55] asdufhbasudhyfb: sod blows
[0:52:00] Schwantes2: SoD doesnt have much to do

[0:52:09] Schwantes2: I like it still though
[0:52:11] sonoma121: alot of people play wow on sht pc lol
[0:52:14] Voriq: small indie company cut them some slack
[0:52:24] itsmistero: too many layers, now enough layers, they need to lay sod tf down and just play retail
[0:52:31] Hitmarkz: is deathmark not physical?
[0:52:34] dolanknoob: I want to pvp, not pve, and all SOD has is world pvp that gets hella boring after a day.
[0:52:45] jixxerpvp: rogue and spiest / boomy are the AWC classes that are dominating so DH may not be the problem lol
[0:52:53] dolanknoob: short nameplate range triggers me.
[0:53:00] moistydank: yea id play SOD if there were arenas
[0:53:02] flovin1: it's just classic wow
[0:53:02] moistydank: that would be dope
[0:53:03] chrisiirc: SoD is just ridiculous
[0:53:05] hemm__: you can play retail on a petty shit pc
[0:53:09] Atlas62: @jixxerpvp hell nah DH main spoted LOL
[0:53:11] flovin1: retail is the future
[0:53:12] sugundeese23: got to 40 its dry
[0:53:13] hemm__: *pretty
[0:53:15] i_Static: @dolanknoob sod has AB & WSG no arenas this
[0:53:18] Kelaenopanda: Classic is so awful. The people who love classic wow probably love punching themselves in the balls over and over again.
[0:53:23] chrisiirc: you a clencher?
[0:53:26] moistydank: fuck it
[0:53:26] matt_caste: pull em, don't need teeth for beers

[0:53:37] buoylouis: go to ur dentist appointment dude
[0:53:38] i_Static: def go
[0:53:41] tigerslap_ow: take care of your teeth while you're young bro.
[0:53:43] dreambear__: as a dental hygienist-go!
[0:53:43] saren8: I saw an old video when you were on tempo storm, and you used to be so tan!
[0:53:55] Baclash_Gaming: one thing at a time homie

[0:54:14] saren8: You look paler than most ghosts
[0:54:17] dolanknoob: There is no pvp balance on SOD either. Tons of classes have insane one shots that are tilting. Priest SW:D, starsurge, ambush, etc.
[0:54:21] SingularitySeven: get that shit taken care of, teeth infections are no joke
[0:54:21] Insperace: when moving out of your parents basement?

[0:55:31] i_Static: stop buying cart parts and buy house parts
[0:55:31] saren8: Last thing we want is Pikaboo getting nailed
[0:55:36] flovin1: you still need your parents
[0:55:38] TheMercDeadpool: I got a nail in my tire 3 times in 2 weeks

[0:57:47] matt_caste: I didn't know twitch could fire you, that sucks man
[0:57:51] flovin1: well that doesn't sound like a big problem though'

[0:58:34] Cuddle_Bunz: am i crazy for thinking the 90% mastery embellishment is garbo for pvp?

[0:59:19] Cpmirel: Twitch lettin interest build on your money bruh
[0:59:20] chrisiirc: any reason you chose the cheque option?
[0:59:21] Ilove_togetwet: why would you get paid by check?
[0:59:22] BoilerRoomTV: good luck trying to beat amazons lawyers
[0:59:22] bonedbad92: Pikas 45 day is probably half our yearly pay though lol

[1:06:28] GoSolarASAP: @인터넷포트 bro, if you have a wells fargo checking account and wells fargo is giving you the mortgage, they can see your shit
[1:06:29] Docaan: that priest
[1:06:30] dolanknoob: @sholland Yeah I know, It's immoral and justified through profit motive. If they started paying weekly, would it cause twitch to go under?

[1:07:00] grimmlols: i used to be a banker and self employed loans were the worst
[1:07:03] 인터넷포트: @GoSolarASAP They dont care about your bank account they look at your income, what you own, and credit rating
[1:07:08] grimmlols: Yes they do
[1:07:08] i_Static: ads/subs/donos @kevogasm
[1:07:09] whattheh3llbro: is your new place in nor cal or so cal?
[1:07:09] Insperace: pay for points

[1:07:16] Nvellen: they absolutely can
[1:07:16] sinyaii: Yes they do
[1:07:17] chrisiirc: banks are the eye in the sky
[1:07:21] sinyaii: they run like 10 hard inquiries
[1:07:23] grimmlols: assets, income and credit
[1:07:25] capnzac: you cant transfer shit outta accounts when you have a mortgage loan
[1:07:25] Insperace: look at your soul
[1:07:27] capnzac: pending
[1:07:27] kevogasm: Yea, when you buy a house they want to know whats going in and out
[1:07:29] capnzac: or whatevver
[1:07:34] sholland: @sholland They are closing TwitchKorea because they are bleeding money. I dont know if they would go under, but I'm sure they would start pushing ads more and streamers couldn't say diff
[1:07:36] Jangoman: Its harder for loans for self employed people then if your W2
[1:07:36] GoSolarASAP: if you're a 1099, you have to show them bank statements and everything. it's different if you're a W2 employee and have pay stubs to show. you don't have paystubs as 1099. that's why it's different
[1:07:38] dolanknoob: It's invasive as fuck
[1:07:41] itsmistero: @Suchacrisis they do not look at current transactions and think, hm that might be fake money he got from someboday, lol, no.
[1:07:44] dabaddon: I say you don’t stress about it right now pick it back up in the morning I’m starting to see some bald spots
[1:07:46] GoSolarASAP: @Jangoman exactly
[1:07:47] Suchacrisis: If you have any investment accounts you cannot touch them. You pretty much can only using your checking account

[1:07:58] SingularitySeven: Dogecoin millionaire
[1:08:01] itsmistero: Atleast not in my neck of the woods.
[1:08:04] i_Static: my gf & I just bought our first house in December what a fucking headache lol
[1:08:16] itsmistero: maybe its a cali thing
[1:08:18] GoSolarASAP: @Pikabooirl it's because you're self employed aka 1099, you have to show WAY more such as bank statements and all kinds of shit versus if you were a W2 employee. these people don't understand cause they're W2 employees
[1:08:31] sholland: @dabaddon Look at all the streaming companies now pushing ads into their service. Video streaming is grossly expensive and we all want to watch in min 1080
[1:08:34] Jangoman: Car loans just lower you debt to income ratio
[1:08:35] cpiexo112: @i_Static same, bankers and lawyers are dumbest ppl
[1:08:36] Tinmania: I refinanced my car a month before closing but it was easy for them to track that
[1:08:56] 인터넷포트: So they checked your assets as leverage for safety net on the loan
[1:09:00] GoSolarASAP: IT'S ALL GUCCI

[1:10:11] Suchacrisis: @itsmistero It's not a matter of fake, they want to be sure you have the money to cover closing and down payment and didn't receive it from a loan or other means.
[1:10:12] 인터넷포트: His eyesight went down 20 rating
