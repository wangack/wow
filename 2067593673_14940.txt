[5:02:40] Edeslash: yes
[5:02:43] Edeslash: extremely zased dungeon
[5:03:04] Edeslash: people who complain about small corridors are cringe and are dealing with an l2p issue
[5:03:28] aFlyingGuru: the corridors are literally festering dogshit
[5:03:43] Byrchi: Everbloom is the best dungeon in the season
[5:03:49] Edeslash: the corridors are a tank skill check
[5:03:50] Angeels: true
[5:03:55] Angeels: everbloom is the best
[5:03:57] Edeslash: positioning is an important tank skill, maybe the most important one
[5:03:59] Angeels: corridors are cringe
[5:04:01] aFlyingGuru: i would rather fight the tree on +32 tyrannical than do a big trash pull in a corridor on +8 fortified
[5:04:03] Edeslash: corridors are a positioning check

[5:04:57] Edeslash: i really dislike EB and DHT for some reason
[5:05:15] eyxx: darkheart is pretty fetid yeah
[5:05:16] Edeslash: EB first boss should not exist because of its mechanics
[5:05:27] aFlyingGuru: EB is pretty rotten tbh
[5:05:30] Edeslash: last 2 bosses are great tho
[5:05:49] Edeslash: idk i feel like people like EB because there are big pulls with flowers but honestly i don't care if i'm hitting 10 or 3 targets in a pull
[5:05:51] niko_is_bad: EB other than 1st boss is very good
[5:06:15] aFlyingGuru: eh
[5:06:37] aFlyingGuru: 3rd boss memes you hard with multihit firestorm on 1 person
[5:06:42] Angeels: big pulls are just satisfying
[5:06:43] aFlyingGuru: and most of the trash is pretty lame
[5:06:48] eyxx: EB first boss is still way more enjoyable on dps than this fucking abomination of boss design they're fighting right now
[5:07:00] Edeslash: idk i'd rather play this than EB first boss
[5:07:02] aFlyingGuru: yay i love abom+triple berserker+stinger pull
[5:07:04] Angeels: its a worse version of BRH end boss
[5:07:12] Angeels: at least you can fight back vs the swarm
[5:07:32] Edeslash: you also see who the swarm targets before it lands
[5:07:37] Edeslash: this boss would be so easy to fix
[5:07:41] Edeslash: show the target while he casts
[5:07:46] Angeels: it ust shouldnt stun you as well
[5:07:51] eyxx: i can't understand how someone can design video game enemies for a living and thinks getting repeatedly stunned without any counterplay is fun
[5:07:54] Edeslash: honestly yeah
[5:08:05] eyxx: let me play my video game
[5:08:06] Angeels: and bad luck mitigation
[5:08:35] Edeslash: it would be punishing enough without the stun and you would probably take tank clears more often (only because you're able to)
[5:08:45] aFlyingGuru: @eyxx not that im in love with this boss design, but not every moment of gameplay is supposed to be directly "fun" inherently
[5:09:04] Edeslash: at least i'm interacting with something on this boss
[5:09:11] Edeslash: EB first boss is just turning your brain off for 5 minutes
[5:10:02] aFlyingGuru: surely they can finish 20 mil with 5 more roots and a clear xddTree
