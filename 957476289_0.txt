[1:01:54] Prevention6: @ladykawa play with friends if possible or find a good guild with community is my only suggestions
[1:02:18] TheEnstraynomic: so what are the chances that blizzard removes the free level 58 boost for TBC if the community complains loud enough?
[1:02:26] DocsMistake: our guild is almost at the point where we will have a decent amount of people for 50+ dungeons
[1:02:27] LadyKawa: @Prevention6 thats also a good shout, ty :)
[1:02:35] CADZtv: leveling tbc to 60 was easier tho right
[1:02:38] CADZtv: in
[1:02:42] Rudric_Ice: boosts will fuck up that nostalgia for tbc
[1:02:44] TheUnknowing: im at level 36 right now and really just taking my time with it, i try to get atleast a level a day but sometimes i dont and thats fine
[1:02:53] CADZtv: lit
[1:03:07] RadiatingShark: @TheUnknowing I think thats the best way to go about it
[1:03:20] secondarych: noo :( boost should be to 70
[1:03:24] Shurn_82: yea, most people who played bc, already had 60s
[1:04:17] CADZtv: KEKW
[1:04:21] Noshpan: Unless you want to level a Blood Elf
[1:04:27] rrabbitt: leveling warrior not druid?
[1:04:49] Shurn_82: @rrabbitt druid is his gold machine
[1:05:03] Shurn_82: and probably change of pace
[1:05:10] stratiss: it's funny though, if you cant handle classic leveling, you certainly can't handle BC attunements
[1:05:14] eldevil86: boosters will also just buy gold
[1:05:19] TheUnknowing: I imagine it will be faster too cause of the 2.4.3 patch
[1:05:43] Noshpan: I'm still debating if I want a BE Hunter, BE Paladin or BE Warlock
[1:05:44] Shurn_82: some of them are
[1:05:45] Darzetti_: not all care about attunements
[1:05:50] Varsader: attunements and leveling are a valid comparison...

[1:15:27] Hughston29: do you Have to buy epic riding before flying?
[1:15:31] ryderthewriter: couldnt that be exploited
[1:15:34] Prevention6: il take the toaster my pcs motherboard is fried lol
[1:15:39] CADZtv: im looking it up it says 160 when flying
[1:15:42] ryderthewriter: like i pay 1 gold for 10000 gold, but i paid irl for the 10000 gold
[1:15:44] CADZtv: im so confused
[1:16:10] Shurn_82: if you generalize speed yes...its considered 160% speed, but tooltip says 60% flying
[1:16:13] sticksaredrifting: after 150 theres 3 books

He has also been talking about that he wants a computer so i managed to talk my wife into buying a comp so i can play fortnite with him and he gets a Computer and the same time i had tbc in my mind 😂😂😂
[1:22:12] Shurn_82: aoe loot...help them farmers out more
[1:22:41] TheRedJaguars: it launched with wrath
[1:22:42] cardinal02: Launched with Wrath. Was like 15g to learn to dual spec?
[1:22:47] TheRedJaguars: prepatch it came out i believe
[1:22:47] BlueBeast33: dual-spec would be nice so I don't have to deal with constant 50g respecs
[1:22:57] Shurn_82: was it not prepatch for wrath?
[1:23:02] TheRedJaguars: yeah
[1:23:03] FaceMcShooty: automatic dismount when u attack or want to fly anywhere
[1:23:03] TheUnknowing: oh no, initially it was like 1000 or 100 i dont remember @cardinal02
[1:23:06] DocsMistake: dual spec was originally 1000g in wrath
[1:23:06] TheRedJaguars: thats what i meant, sorry
[1:23:23] TheRedJaguars: it came out for the wrath prepatch
[1:23:27] cardinal02: Ahh. Im misremembering then. 11 years been a while lol
[1:24:00] TheRedJaguars: i played tbc heavily both raid and arena and it was expensive
[1:24:04] TheRedJaguars: it was huge at the end
[1:24:36] Gnral: wait amin they didt nerff classic right
[1:25:00] Shurn_82: they did
[1:25:02] TheRedJaguars: or you can just set a manageable price limit for changing
[1:25:03] Bestbud: classic did get kinda steam rolled
[1:25:09] Prevention6: pre nerf heroic dungeons in BC are hard right?
[1:25:27] mykologist: Gold sink?
[1:25:28] TheRedJaguars: is gold really a thing right now? i know so many players that are playing classic loaded with money
[1:25:33] TheEnstraynomic: wouldn't some people still complain about how adding dual spec would inflate the economy?
[1:25:34] TheUnknowing: well you have to go to the trainer to buy it
[1:25:48] BlueBeast33: As a rogue I'm gonna both pve and pvp so dual-spec would be so nice
[1:26:04] Shurn_82: not unless they recently released naw
[1:26:09] TheUnknowing: most private server stuff is nerfed honestly
[1:26:29] ryderthewriter: that server is mainly pvp i heard
[1:26:40] metavahn231: tbc will rek those casuals hoping for easy clears
[1:26:46] Shurn_82: most pservers have huge scripts modified
[1:26:52] BlueBeast33: that private server has more changes than tbc classic lol
[1:27:09] Bestbud: endless said they had an increased content difficulty but not sure how much
[1:27:13] DreavT2K: everybody is cheering prebuff tul it launches then everybody complains
[1:28:06] BlueBeast33: Hellfire is gonna have like 50 layers
[1:28:09] metavahn231: stuck picking a herb
[1:28:16] shimwood: If there weren't server problems, would it really be a Blizzard game?
[1:28:18] Bestbud: yeah their pve had some increased difficulty but they said to make it challenging but fair. So safe to say not pre nerfs and only 2.4.3 loot rules
[1:28:48] Prevention6: i could never play seriously on private servers everytime i tried one it just felt off to me , lots of random bugs etc
[1:28:48] FaceMcShooty: i'm hyped for sure but i'm not sure if i want to play in the first 2 or 3 days xD the first area will be overloaded as fuck
[1:29:02] verzliasukis: how many alts are you preping for tbc?
[1:29:14] Shurn_82: those blue shards, should be off basalisks
[1:29:24] Infinitepeeep: ^
[1:29:31] Shurn_82: they wont be in a cave, but a valley near it
[1:30:05] Moorishak: Shurn_82 nope, those shards are drop from those goblins
[1:30:23] Moorishak: there is multiple quests with shards and crystals
[1:30:32] Shurn_82: ahh
[1:30:34] Prevention6: yeah leveling in hellfire at tbc launch will be a shitshow i bet
[1:30:45] Shurn_82: yea i rely on questie haha

[1:31:32] Moorishak: Prevention6 thats why all minmaxers goin directly to spam dungeons for karazhan attunement.

[1:32:18] Phindrius: ^
[1:32:23] Binch54: well raid bosses in general on privates nowadays have 3x HP compared to retail BC, let's be real and admit the steamroll in blues and green at launch is gonna happen
[1:32:34] Prevention6: @moorisha yeah spamming ramparts to start would definitely be the way to go
[1:32:52] RaysFTW: I feel like the grind in SL is so much better than it was but there's just too much of it.
[1:33:02] uawildcat04: @Towelliee did you see the consipriacy theory that you arent taking meds but just getting jacked to prank chat when you come back?
[1:33:12] Shurn_82: shards - basilisks   crystals - miners
[1:33:15] Shurn_82: good to know
[1:33:19] metavahn231: there's nothing worth while to grind lol
[1:33:25] secondarych: LUL
[1:33:40] Moorishak: Prevention6 they skip ramparts and goin directly to blood furnace...more mobs and perfectly fit to hour reset lock. Ramparts are too short.
[1:33:59] metavahn231: towellie taking 8 thermogenics a day and is the niagara falls right now
[1:34:00] Hjolt: anima is worth the grind by it's own. don't you looove the blue orbs?
[1:34:03] Hjolt: :)
[1:34:11] commanderdingus: hmm that weak aura isnt workin for me
[1:34:14] cardinal02: Renown grind isnt bad. Im curious to see if there is an automatic +renown start. Like talk to the speaker and get renown +20 or something
[1:34:36] Prevention6: @moorisha oh true i didnt know if blood furnace would be more or less efficient than ramparts at 58
[1:34:48] metavahn231: and isnt renown/valor just a catch up mechanic for casuals with unlucky rng

[1:36:57] idenkaz_: so you think the mindset came from the inside instead of big streamers praising let loot be loot bs? i mean ok
[1:37:01] xideontv: I WANT MY LOOT NOW
[1:37:04] Prevention6: @moorisha ah yeah that makes sense i was thinking of level 58-60 average geared players
[1:37:08] metavahn231: bfa was WoW meets diablo...and it actually worked despite the complainers lol
[1:37:13] Sandisy: their failure was making pvp loot clearly the superior way. think there are tons of people that refuse to pvp
[1:37:16] Infinitepeeep: maybe its just me but i sometimes feel retail is too fast paced
[1:37:17] Hjolt: if they starved us of loot for 3 expansions in a row maybe we would tho
[1:37:46] cardinal02: Yeah progression nowadays is much faster than what it was in classic. I've gone 20 bosses without a drop and it feels bad. That in classic is normal.
[1:37:51] RaegonGaming: We would quit by then haha
[1:37:52] Hjolt: LUL
[1:37:57] metavahn231: i already quit, 3 expanions? lol
[1:38:06] metavahn231: try 1 patch
[1:38:38] Hjolt: i wonder where wow will go next ,after the shadowlands
[1:38:44] metavahn231: did they really think ppl would just grind for the loot this way
[1:38:50] metavahn231: instead of just quit
[1:38:58] Alegnowar: i'm sure this loot "experiment" is not gonna last too long after seeing the numbers LUL

[1:40:32] beckett3a: one thing i hope blizz takes away from tbc is how useful professions are
[1:40:36] metavahn231: i just want a chance, even if its small to get something good
[1:40:41] Sandisy: even with valor I've seen people run a m+ over 20 times without getting the drop they want to upgrade
[1:40:46] TheUnknowing: Its just not enjoyable when the game clearly isnt designed to be that way any more
[1:40:54] RoboMaximillion: i remember some people being all happy with the loot system at the beginning
[1:41:01] RaysFTW: The old school way captured the perfect demographic when that demographic had a lot of time on their hands.
[1:41:03] TheUnknowing: playing classic is different right cause the game feels like its designed that way, retail doesnt
[1:41:04] RoboMaximillion: and then they went quiet after a while
[1:41:08] SaltySandman__: Less not loot way not that bad but if you get the same shitty cloak everytime but not the good one its sucks. Then the vault just give you dupes and people get angery.

[1:42:20] burton303: i feel like the vault kinda made it way easier if u a top end player u just max gear so much faster
[1:42:20] Phindrius: They should have gone the Classic+ route instead of TBC, similar to how OSRS has
[1:42:36] metavahn231: what was 10s, 200? dang it was even worse
[1:43:00] TheUnknowing: Disagree, if they do a + anything it should be with tbc, tbc is 100x better than vanilla @Phindrius
[1:43:06] xideontv: tens are 203
[1:43:10] xideontv: 7s are 200

[1:48:07] rami730: you can't boost blood elves and space goats
[1:48:16] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: D:
[1:48:29] metavahn231: are most people really going to boost, doubt it
[1:48:40] rami730: oh
[1:48:45] TheUnknowing: I'm sure there will be people in the guild who dungeon boost you
[1:48:48] metavahn231: probably just solo level as always
[1:48:54] DreavT2K: 58 dollar confirmed
[1:48:58] Infinitepeeep: refering to mage boost
[1:48:59] DreavT2K: for boost
[1:49:13] Hjolt: your blood elf will be forever tainted by the grind then Kappa
[1:49:13] Blastaho: So how many characters can come to TBC
[1:49:21] Blastaho: Just one copy is that correct
[1:49:31] CDubTheRIPper: if tokens is a thing in classic then boosting will be huge monkaS
[1:49:45] CDubTheRIPper: or TBC i should say
[1:49:46] Blastaho: Then pay for each
[1:49:57] Blastaho: I thought it was one
[1:50:21] Hjolt: essentially classic becomes TBC, and you get option to go for Classic+
[1:50:37] Blastaho: Oh ok
[1:51:25] whensdinnertv: what server

[1:52:32] cardinal02: how many servers will exist for classic though? 6? 3 for pve and 3 for pvp? 1 for each major TZ?

[1:53:10] Utmost777: the other camp of these guys
[1:53:28] Utmost777: there are 2 named guys there you need i think
[1:53:41] Blastaho: Where is the Druid?
[1:53:44] whensdinnertv: streamerlina killed classic, too many people killin eachother for the chance to play with big streamers, made it super toxic and destroyed other servers in the process
[1:53:51] metavahn231: are people really calling blizzard racist for making the brokers have arab accents LUL
[1:54:10] BlueBeast33: it's one toon so blizz can min max your wallet
[1:54:13] Mitune: yes it is only if you want to keep a copy of your character to stay in vanilla
[1:54:19] Blastaho: Oh ok so for classic u pay
[1:54:20] Playwisme: you can choose TBC or Classic per character, have to pay a fee if you want to do both, per charcter
[1:54:34] whensdinnertv: faerlina=streamerlina
[1:54:39] TheUnknowing: you only pay if you want them to move to tbc and also move to the new classic era realms
[1:54:42] Hitokiri83: sounds Romanian to me
[1:54:43] Mitune: ^
[1:55:18] daegoh: im offended mario has an italian accent kappa
[1:55:43] Utmost777: Esfand said he is staying
[1:55:47] CDubTheRIPper: well his name is staysafe Kappa
[1:55:59] Bestbud: soda loves it, he gets to kill world buff people when they leave stormwind
[1:56:24] cardinal02: Esfand is staying because he has alts, guild, and main max level. If youre starting fresh, best to start on medium pop
[1:56:25] BlueBeast33: faerlina is more alliance dominated now these days, horde side should be more worried, so streamers like Soda
[1:56:30] Utmost777: it will be P2 all over
[1:56:39] Qoax: How come your webcam is off m8
[1:56:50] kroknows101: !cam

[1:58:21] cardinal02: GAMER
[1:58:22] NOHITJEROME: intercept*
[1:58:30] metavahn231: whats with this quest you need a raid for it
[1:58:49] metavahn231: or 2 overgeared people
[1:58:59] Utmost777: @Veramer there are a lot of quests like this in classic for Warriors lol
[1:59:39] TheUnknowing: You have to be super careful with your pulls as a warrior leveling
[1:59:49] metavahn231: even with the famous whirlwind axe?
[1:59:51] neverbornlucky: the warrior is the reason I am leveling a druid instead
[1:59:54] NOHITJEROME: paladins are slowwww going
[2:00:07] Utmost777: pally is so much auto attack
[2:00:11] Blastaho: And ur Druid??
[2:00:12] Jimmy__Ricard: it comes down to sustain right? warrs and pally's ahve shit sustain
[2:00:19] personal_raineri: i quit my warrior at 53 for almost a year and just came back to it last week, now im 58.5 :D
[2:00:20] Darzetti_: yea war lvling is why im lvling a mage until boost comes out
[2:00:38] metavahn231: its because most paladins try to level in might instead of mana blessing
[2:00:43] beckett3a: yeah warrior leveling with good gear is so fun
[2:00:45] NOHITJEROME: warlocks are a dream to level
[2:00:49] NOHITJEROME: no downtime, shredding mobs
[2:00:51] beckett3a: stance dancing is so fun
[2:00:52] PadidinJones: Hey @Towelliee !
[2:00:58] TheUnknowing: same except im leveling a druid @Darzetti_
[2:00:58] Utmost777: druid can do 2-3 if you pull as bear then heal and go to cat for the last one
[2:01:02] Moorishak: I hate druid leveling...you can not speak or use any items in form LUL its annoying
[2:01:16] Jimmy__Ricard: I guess you could just spam bandages inbetween fights when needed @Towelliee
[2:01:20] metavahn231: also 5% parry talent is so good, parry haste is amazing
[2:01:22] Shurn_82: yea hes around the fire

[2:02:57] rottenbanana64: is ANY class easy to level in in classic ? I rolled a priest (shadow) - i think i died more times tll level 20 than i did on all my retail toons
[2:03:00] Vurisa: i typed that before you looted it
[2:03:12] NOHITJEROME: @rottenbanana64 its all about being a bit overleveled for areas
[2:03:17] NOHITJEROME: if you are 2-3 levels low for an area its a struggle
[2:03:17] Infinitepeeep: hunter or warlock
[2:03:17] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/ODsxw67GYJw TBC #somechanges
[2:03:21] Infinitepeeep: cruze control
[2:03:33] metavahn231: mage may be easy but the constant drinking kills it
[2:03:35] BlueBeast33: I'm leveling a disc/shadow priest it's very easy
[2:03:36] Moorishak: Priest is easy man...to level 40 you only do bubble and wand
[2:03:41] NOHITJEROME: yeah the mage drinking is annoying
[2:03:42] Moorishak: you literally cant die
[2:03:43] topjester666: I leveled a ShadowPriest in classic.  That was horrible.
[2:03:59] javlini: as warrior you just need to level in dungeons as a tank alot and not questr
[2:04:11] NOHITJEROME: LUL
[2:04:42] TheEnstraynomic: i wonder how many Olympus guilds are still active on faerlina LUL

[2:04:56] Blastaho: How many tunes do u want
[2:05:13] Blastaho: Are u tired of retail??
[2:05:20] rottenbanana64: i was trying to get into esfands guild and they said they needed a priest.. i hate classic becoz of that decision.. should have rolled a mage / 'lock ... have fun on both in retail

[2:11:27] chiknandwaflz: Hateful 8 had intermissions
[2:11:31] Sapz92: Warcraft was BAD
[2:11:42] Sapz92: it doesnt make any sense lore wise
[2:11:43] imallin1234: Remember going to the movies?
[2:11:56] Noshpan: My aunt enjoyed the Warcraft the movie & wants a sequel.
[2:11:58] Sheckly84: warcraft was alright, but it really needed the LOTR extended edition treatment.
[2:12:00] minael1: warcraft movie was awesome! i loved it
[2:12:02] raymond3195: I liked warcraft movie
[2:12:10] CDubTheRIPper: yeah anyone watching it who doesnt play or at least know a little lore didnt watch or didnt know wtf was going on LUL

[2:12:20] CDubTheRIPper: didnt play*
[2:12:28] Sapz92: with warcraft movie, they had this amazing storyline ready for the pickup, nah lets just make up some bullcrap instead

[2:13:04] Hjolt: actor choice for Khadgar tho... Man does not fit the profile

[2:13:41] vimie: A lot of people play WoW because it's the biggest mmo not for the story
[2:13:50] PadidinJones: Its really sad. They wont make a warcraft 2 will they?]
[2:13:59] stratiss: Still want an Arthas movie
[2:13:59] NOHITJEROME: they are making a warcraft 2 @PadidinJones
[2:14:16] TheEnstraynomic: isn't NA dead last in a lot of other things? like cars, E-Sports teams, healthcare, but at least we're among the top in covid infections and deaths NotLikeThis
[2:14:16] PadidinJones: @NOHITJEROME Noice!
[2:14:19] kroknows101: I don't think it even really appealed to current wow players. They picked such an obscure time frame to start a movie from.
[2:14:19] Sapz92: the storyline didnt make any sense at all in Warcraft movie

[2:14:33] PadidinJones: Kidgar not Dadgar
[2:14:33] DocsMistake: now i kind of want to watch the movie lol
[2:14:37] Tzarvahl: honestly, warcraft needed to be like a LOTR 3 hour movie for the story to be properly told
[2:14:45] BlueBeast33: Duncan Jones said several times he wanted to make a trilogy, but I guess Blizzard changed their mind
[2:14:46] Sheckly84: Khadgar was the best part of the movie IMO
[2:14:48] NOHITJEROME: there are rumors of one and they want chris pratt for it
[2:14:54] neverbornlucky: They should make a Warcraft TV series
[2:15:02] Sheckly84: Well, Gul'Dan was well done too
[2:15:04] CADZtv: wacraft netflix show Pog ?
[2:15:04] drmabusee: we are already in wow 9 -.-
[2:15:05] Sapz92: if they want to make any money, they shouldnt make up a storyline, just follow the original
[2:15:08] stratiss: it's rumored that they are making a 2
[2:15:28] DreavT2K: let the dude who made lord of the rings make a warcraft movie
[2:15:28] Tzarvahl: god i hope that diablo show is good

[2:16:07] stratiss: Sadge
[2:16:13] Phindrius: The warcraft movie would have been so much better if they had just gone down the full CGI route - they are the kings of the cutscene ffs
[2:16:13] Yenroz: "they are deffinetly not making a 2" thats something someone whos hiding it would say... Also someone who doesnt belive they are making one LUL
[2:16:13] Tzarvahl: @NOHITJEROME yeah man, these streaming services will kill for something to get ppl to sub

[2:16:48] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: manabombs everywhere... exploding sheeps n shit
[2:16:52] TheEnstraynomic: imagine if they re-enact the teldrassil burning with michael bay at the helm, the mushroom could would be massive
[2:17:04] Tzarvahl: idk if peter jackson would want to take on a project that big, he didnt even want to do the hobbit when that other guy dipped on it
[2:17:10] Yenroz: Tom cruise could be in that goblin/gnome movie Kappa
[2:17:11] PrismaticFlair: i say let jj abrams do it
[2:17:21] deekayed: id watch it
[2:17:28] Shurn_82: @FruitfulBob did you read the hobbit?
[2:17:28] CADZtv: get peter jackson to make warcraft movie
[2:17:38] Hjolt: the biggest question is- who would play illidan in wacraft movies if we ever get to that point?
[2:17:40] Hjolt: LUL
[2:17:50] PrismaticFlair: i think the netflix show idea is good
[2:18:02] CADZtv: yh a show would be safer option
[2:18:06] DocsMistake: make a TV series that follows the Varian Wrynn comic storyline
[2:18:12] rottenbanana64: id like to see how Michael Bay arcane blasts  lol or a chaos bolt for a lock
[2:18:16] Yliwos: @Hjolt vin diesel
[2:18:18] Broheim2813: What is happening with the TBC beta ? Thought it would come this week ?
[2:18:26] Hjolt: oh god oh fuck @Yliwos
[2:18:28] CADZtv: people love shows mediaval stuff
[2:18:34] CADZtv: like
[2:18:40] TrashWizardd: If they focused on a movie based on actual WoW cinematics instead of a live action they could legit get the same voices for the game, Liam O'Brian could be Illidan again >.<
[2:19:05] Streamcrush: war of the ancients
[2:19:14] NOHITJEROME: yeah a lich king movie would be great
[2:19:14] whofortedd: Get Bill Burr to play Tirion
[2:19:17] neverbornlucky: Give us Jaina
[2:19:19] JokaThS: legion @Towelliee
[2:19:25] Sapz92: just do warcraft 3 storyline
[2:19:25] Hjolt: I dunno, story of a guy slowly falling from a good to evil is always popular.
[2:19:35] whofortedd: I fucking love Bill Burr
[2:19:43] CADZtv: OR the dragon aspects dad gorgond or w/e
[2:19:44] ridgidrex77: death wing movie would be sweet

[2:20:07] Hjolt: Netflix series about PANDAS. I'm in LUL
[2:20:09] NOHITJEROME: but generally positive reviews
[2:20:12] Streamcrush: honestly the orcs were the best part of the movie, if they made a series chronicling how Draenor went to crap I'd watch it
[2:20:34] minael1: i would not want to visit your nightmare country dude. maybe when the woke plague goes away..maybe.
[2:20:37] NOHITJEROME: not the pandas @Hjolt
[2:20:41] PrismaticFlair: illidan is my fav would be cool for a series about him, as long as they get a good enough actor
[2:20:58] Sapz92: only thing that draenor left on me is pure regret on my waller
[2:21:02] Hjolt: @NOHITJEROME  you know you like pandaria, deep down. We all do, there is no shame in it :)
[2:21:16] Gnral: green orcs were dark in lotr ,and the ring of power is frostmourne and helm give me a break ...

[2:22:36] Spazz__: i love shadowlands. i have a hard time relating to peoples problems with it.
[2:22:41] Tzarvahl: they need to stop trying to come out with these fancy ass mechanics and new systems, it takes way too much dev time. just make the damn game with some good dungeons and arenas
[2:22:46] TheEnstraynomic: would the economy shrinking have anything to do with the sub count to, with people having to choose between eating 1 meal for the week, making rent/mortgage payments, or paying for wow
[2:22:54] Sapz92: need max I think
[2:23:13] Sapz92: no, max before upgrade

[2:23:58] neverbornlucky: f rent I spent my stimulus money on vr
[2:24:28] neverbornlucky: That why I can't wait for Zenith MMORPG
[2:24:37] Sheckly84: Honestly I can't put a finger on why I quit Shadowlands. I just got bored of mmo's in general I guess. Doesn't matter to Blizz though because to them, I paid for a full year in advance I thought i was gunna play.
[2:24:56] Sheckly84: I guess I can come back any time I want if i feel the itch again
[2:25:07] Phindrius: Isn't mageweave the trauma quest where you have to bandage X amount of people?
[2:25:17] Sapz92: no that was for the skill, what I ment, but you already unlocked 300 First Aid
[2:25:52] neverbornlucky: Zenith is a VR MMORPG that looks promising for classes and play style not a wow killer but a big step in vr for mmorpg

[3:30:44] GonoFPS: only people I know so far who ar emaking a huge deal out of it are the classic streamers Make Azeroth great Again  memers
[3:30:56] dutchie76: ooo these quests
[3:30:56] AirmVn: but I don't get it why do you want to play current wow in classic wow
[3:30:59] AirmVn: you have current wow
[3:31:09] ILikeKillTheZombies: i would like to see streamers in some big podcast talking about it and see all the perspectives at once
[3:31:10] dutchie76: searing gorge
[3:31:17] FaceMcShooty: to be honest i wouldn't even mind an improved xp rate from 1 to 58
[3:31:19] AirmVn: exactly, what you have in current wow
[3:31:25] raymond3195: if bc hype lasts a year I'd be surprised
[3:31:27] shadez1: tink not having lfg in classic kinda hurt the game befor boost shit happening
[3:31:27] bimyouX: wtf is this logic
[3:31:30] krajar96: i dont get that argument lol
[3:31:35] mikejames01: Paid stuff is NOT bad for it
[3:31:37] FolkWardz: That isn't logic xD
[3:31:45] Meraut: If Ned Neckbeard can have his 16 hour game sessions invalidated by some "normie" who can pay to skip everything it will ruin the game.
[3:31:45] CADZtv: @AirMAnLTK wth is that logic
[3:31:47] dutchie76: yes
[3:31:49] dutchie76: elites
[3:32:06] BLARGO_: If that was the case then we shouldn't have paid character transfers LULW
[3:32:09] thatquidproquo: @shadez1 I've never had a problem finding dungeon groups but yeah dungeon finder would make things easier
[3:32:10] bimyouX: Its so boring, anyone against no changes are like: WHY DO YOU WANNA PLAY RETAIL IN TBC, JUST PLAY RETAIl
[3:32:12] mikejames01: A name change of faction would notr hurt classic
[3:32:30] Villie: esfandYou esfandAre esfandDead
[3:32:36] AirmVn: my logic is, everyone wanted an old version of wow because they don't like what current wow represents, and now everyone wants current wow features in old wow
[3:32:42] Kjeen: !TBC

[3:33:00] Swampheat: !tbc
[3:33:01] AirmVn: so what ?
[3:33:01] frischgewischt: wait what boost ?

[3:33:10] FolkWardz: Its about the content though, not the services
[3:33:11] smoro: leveling in Azeroth is still part of TBC what do you mean hahaha
[3:33:13] Hjolt: we invalidating the time effort i guess.  the utter paint that leveling 1-58 is

[3:34:33] mikejames01: all i want to play is BC classic
[3:34:41] AirmVn: then don't play the game
[3:34:43] AirmVn: wtf
[3:34:52] FolkWardz: Same goes the other way
[3:35:00] hadesmoonX: its amazing for bots and gold sellers
[3:35:00] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/ODsxw67GYJw TBC #somechanges
[3:35:02] PrisheBurningBlade: I'm confused if 60 is max level in shadowlands, how is it max level in classic? shouldn't it be like 20?
[3:35:06] bimyouX: all i want is to do TBC dungeons, quest in Outland with the improved questing, and do 70 endcontent
[3:35:06] GonoFPS: LUL
[3:35:07] Hjolt: and i think its absolutely fine. i just can see why people are kind of upset.
[3:35:07] bottledxselfesteem: completely agree with your opinion on this, thank you
[3:35:08] PadidinJones: RAAAAAAAAAGE QUIIIIT!
[3:35:08] SaltySandman__: It's just a single bootst jesus
[3:35:11] BlueBeast33: Draenei and Blood Elves will still have to level btw
[3:35:15] krajar96: that doesnt stop you from doing it your way @AirMAnLTK
[3:35:16] AirmVn: because when people made the game, the designed the game with leveling from 1-70 in mind
[3:35:21] thatquidproquo: eventually they will have classic servers for every xpac so you can play wherever you want
[3:35:22] mikejames01: I wont quit and i will pay for a boost i am planed on it already
[3:35:29] GonoFPS: I had his mentality last year, I bet you my left arm that this dude didnt even went hard at classic and is here typing this garbo
[3:35:31] GonoFPS: come on man
[3:35:33] bimyouX: @AirMAnLTK it was 13years ago
[3:35:35] Laluzmia: LOL
[3:35:43] Noobish101: stahp!
[3:35:47] FolkWardz: No one is forcing you to use the boost :s
[3:35:49] AirmVn: you saw classic only from streamer eyes
[3:35:53] Dennisaurus_Rex: my draenei shaman is getting boosted the fuck up
[3:35:53] bimyouX: this is 2021
[3:35:54] FaceMcShooty: @AirMAnLTK no they did not cause when bc came out ppl were already 60
[3:36:00] Meraut: Don't be a Ned Neckbeard chat
[3:36:06] Felrane: I had more fun on private servers tbh
[3:36:11] chieflovi: you cant boost draenei
[3:36:11] krajar96: @AirMAnLTK you think all of us disagreeing with you are streamers?
[3:36:16] Hjolt: and thank the fuck for that tbh
[3:36:17] mikejames01: I saw classic from my eyes not a streamers
[3:36:18] MuttonChopins: your not gonna get a trophy for playing classic
[3:36:19] Eikus11: @Dennisaurus_Rex cant boost new races
[3:36:24] thatquidproquo: @dennisaurus_rex they won't allow draenei or bloodelf boosts at the start
[3:36:25] sticksaredrifting: theyre listening because they see how shit shadowlands is
[3:36:36] Deathu: The only issue i see with the boost is the amount of bots that'll be able to ruin your experience quicker
[3:36:48] Clicklesly: It's funny how people memed the "You think you do, but you don't" and it was really pretty valid for a majority ^^
[3:36:55] mikejames01: 100% with @Towelliee
[3:37:00] Dennisaurus_Rex: nono i mean boosted the old fashioned way. either by a mage or paladin
[3:37:04] Inapropreate: agreed with towel
[3:37:06] smoro: imagine not being able to get to 58 leveling but thinking you'll enjoy the attunement grind LUL
[3:37:09] Broomba: @codeman19 SL developers aren’t working on Classic wow
[3:37:10] thatquidproquo: oh yeah lol
[3:37:11] FolkWardz: I like this Towelliee :D
[3:37:28] mikejames01: LOL
[3:37:34] Merlin840: if your balls are on fire, please consult your doctor
[3:37:35] thatquidproquo: @smoro those people will quit early like most of them lol
[3:37:35] BLARGO_: The only downside to the boost that I can think of is the botting situation getting worse.
[3:37:40] PadidinJones: but @Towelliee fire under balls could be a STD!
[3:37:49] FaceMcShooty: !yt

[3:37:58] Swaahealey: The boost just lets new people experience current content, if they had to level from 1 they would miss out on kara, gruul, mags progression. It’s a good thing!
[3:38:08] d3rd00mb00mt: @Beyond_The_Invisible nah good old AV with druids, icelord, shamansquad, flying squad etc etc was cool
[3:38:14] sticksaredrifting: @Broomba clearly you missed the point. no one listens for shadowlands. it is now shit. bc devs wont make that mistake
[3:38:18] FaceMcShooty: i want buyable gold for my flyiing XD
[3:38:30] Noobish101: whats the druid for?
[3:38:40] d3rd00mb00mt: the matter was the realm if it was playable and if it took 2 or 3 days to finish and stuff

[3:38:43] PrisheBurningBlade: Blizzard can detect bots in literally 10sec, read the EULA...  they let it hapen for several months, for that sweet sweet sub money, and game purchases, rinse repeat
[3:38:45] sticksaredrifting: they cant even fix a mc bug thats been around since mop
[3:38:49] Broomba: @codeman19 they are 2 entirely projects and leaders omg
[3:38:55] smoro: @thatquidproquo yep so they are putting in a cash shop for a demographic that'll quit in the 1st place :(
[3:39:03] Talason: towelliee do you like pay to win
[3:39:03] chieflovi: Blizzard intentionally doesnt ban bots because of the sub money
[3:39:10] Broomba: Stay off Bellular and Asmon shit
[3:39:12] Noshpan: As someone who started in TBC, I'm all for adding the token into TBC Classic
[3:39:13] PadidinJones: Adding the token might just be an easy way out for blizz. Also recommended
[3:39:14] mikejames01: it is not pay to win omg
[3:39:15] Streamcrush: maybe spend some of that 200 million dollar ceo bonus and hire people to hunt down bots and ban them Kappa
[3:39:17] shogon: china's had the token all through classic, and does perfectly fine, i wouldnt be surprised if its added to NA for TBC
[3:39:29] d3rd00mb00mt: @smoro people ruin faction balance on their own since faction change
[3:40:10] Meraut: they're 100% going to do tokens, its only a matter of when
[3:40:12] d3rd00mb00mt: @StreamCrush thats not the way modern economics work dude!!!1111 some people have to buy the expensive boats and stuff!
[3:40:18] thatquidproquo: even with the token there are still gold farmers. they will lower their prices to be better than the tokens
[3:40:22] personal_raineri: hawha t he shaft
[3:40:24] shogon: upstairs
[3:40:26] shogon: @Towelliee
[3:40:34] PadidinJones: Honestly I think they should make classic services like SWTOR has their cartel.

[3:40:37] FaceMcShooty: i'm so hoping for tokens. the only why i could by my flying in classic bc was to buy it xD
[3:40:46] krajar96: i think it's upstairs @Towelliee
[3:40:53] Streamcrush: @nimm3rm3hr my yachts need yachts yo LUL
[3:41:02] d3rd00mb00mt: @StreamCrush hahaahahaha
[3:41:06] thatquidproquo: gotta be prepping for tbc. start stacking the gold in classic now.
[3:41:07] Haximaxi: there is still tons of bots in retail to though
[3:41:09] Villie: The token doesn’t hurt me
[3:41:12] shogon: @Towelliee he is upstairs just south of the flight master
[3:41:13] smoro: why do people think that leveling in Azeroth is not part of TBC, they legit added some minor new quest hubs and shit and made it 15% faster to make it a bit easier
[3:41:20] PrisheBurningBlade: diff between wow token and USD$$$$ is 25% look at game time / cost / blizzard balance, literally 5$
[3:41:28] GonoFPS: LUL LUL
[3:41:38] sticksaredrifting: @smoro  leveling was decreased wym
[3:41:40] CADZtv: what
[3:41:41] bimyouX: ppl who play classic rn have 20k gold and they crying that the boost will make ppl buy power LOL
[3:41:41] CADZtv: KEKW
[3:41:43] PadidinJones: Retail bots can be fucked with easier than classic
[3:41:44] Detonite: Just make Necromancer a new class in retail and it is game over for classic & tbc
[3:41:45] thatquidproquo: @smoro right. more quests and hubs in azeroth. tbc was a nice time
[3:41:47] Sadisticmedic: WHO is Jill Kelly and Mackenie

[3:43:01] cabalish: get some more spiders
[3:43:08] AlexIncorporated: Blizz only bans every 3 months
[3:43:27] PadidinJones: You know what, I would love to be hired by blizz just to burn bots in classic
[3:43:39] skwagg: Sadly true
[3:43:46] thatquidproquo: @padidinjones dream job
[3:43:47] GonoFPS: yup
[3:43:48] PrisheBurningBlade: if you buying gold on retail you doing it wrong, just sell heroic, its literally 1/4mil a week free gold, in like 90mins
[3:43:50] PopeJonas: the fact that bots are flying around the map is ridiculous
[3:44:07] PadidinJones: @thatquidproquo Id be the best at it yo. I would never get bored with it.

[3:44:57] Streamcrush: back in the day we used to have susanexpress bots drop from the sky to spell the site name on the ground as corpses in orgrimmar

[3:45:47] cabalish: its rep farming i think
[3:45:57] PadidinJones: Coal is a vendor item no?

[3:51:02] Eldood1000: people care since a lot of people like to parse

[3:51:45] BlueBeast33: Drums is a stupid private server meta thing, I thought people were happy about changing that
[3:52:27] The_Dommy_Lama: and even still. the horde have the orc.
[3:52:36] PadidinJones: Jubs sone
[3:52:42] The_Dommy_Lama: so there can be no complaints. they can still parse higher
[3:52:47] GonoFPS: ^
[3:52:49] Eldood1000: @SaltySandman__ i only played classic for awhile just to parse lmao. i didnt even care about raiding. it got extremely boring after kt kill
[3:52:59] GonoFPS: lmao you can't make that point bud
[3:53:00] PrisheBurningBlade: Drums isnt a private sever meta, its understanding the game, we were all idiots 15years ago, we've learned since then. private server meta reflects understanding how the game works
[3:53:17] GonoFPS: making orange parses to begin with is to show that youre numba 1 at your class, You WANT more competition not less

[3:54:20] PrisheBurningBlade: if you took a bunch of mythic raiders from retail, sent them to TBC... they would min/max leathworking for drums

[3:56:15] BlueBeast33: I'm glad they're changing drums, I shouldn't have to go leatherworking on a priest when I want to be an enchanter
[3:56:22] gentlemannnnnnnnn: We only had to take a Flask and food buff, that's it.
[3:56:37] PrisheBurningBlade: Its not because of private servers tho, its because we have learned to min/max. with or without private servers, that meta would happen.  Private servers just expedited the process, but it was inevitable
[3:56:38] kargdahm: you can summon people inside instances anyway in TBC
[3:56:39] MrGattz: @CASHAGA just want to let you know dying light 2 isnt looking so great if you havnt seen the news recently
[3:57:40] its_andyd: zoom in, that looks like a weapon
[3:57:43] PrisheBurningBlade: Look at retail, we min/max a single gem. to think that wouldn't happen on classic, if private server never existed.... it would just take a few weeks to become mainstream
[3:57:58] meh04f: will hunter prob be the best TBC class?
[3:58:25] PrisheBurningBlade: and then the casual guild is telling people to make leatherworking or not come to raid.... thinking.... that is their problem, and not 10people are legit just afk

[3:59:53] PrisheBurningBlade: i'm on the casual raiders emulate the World first stuff, mythic 20+ keys... and if you not doing what they doing, they kick you, when in reality, the issue is people dont know how to press buttons. thats why you not killing heroic sire in SL
[3:59:58] PrisheBurningBlade: not your class or spec
[4:00:39] DenTza: Aye, everyone would have T6 and stuff
[4:01:33] PrisheBurningBlade: tldt a good surv hunter could school their entire guild in DPS if they are a heroic only guild.... but they would prob be kicked for playing it, cuz its not a unholy DK

[4:53:29] TweakT: richkidMillion
[4:53:34] Rayman_1990: @FaceMcShooty thought u were talking bout BC sry. not much difference probably btw, most of OP BC druid things require 60+
[4:53:43] Jokervenom1978: Its so worth it though. Aquatic form makes certain quests trivial.

[5:13:48] Z3r0Fear: I quit playing WoW and play this game instead and find it more fun.
[5:13:58] Arkangel_I: that explains the fight and mechanic
[5:13:59] vikingjason: wot

[6:27:08] Kinghorn: D U N G E O N
[6:27:08] JinTackle: go in with trusts Kappa
[6:27:16] JinTackle: bots
[6:27:19] Kinghorn: trust crap
[6:27:22] JinTackle: you can do the dungeon with the NPC bois
[6:27:23] Meepzter: Trust system, you can go in solo with them
[6:27:23] Shrenko: you can choose your team
[6:27:28] Kinghorn: NPC dungeon bots
[6:27:30] Shrenko: instead of playing with real players
[6:27:30] TrowGundam: @TheOmniSora Nah, getting flying is mostly just doing the MSQ and a few side quests
[6:27:32] chickenwienersoup: what is a trust?
[6:27:36] Lemonmunch3r: Is this game any good considerting the social aspect?
[6:27:37] Bogzeh: @TheOmniSora to unlcok flying? no u just find the aether currents with the ingame compass
[6:27:47] Lemonmunch3r: Or is it mostly solo content?
[6:27:48] TrowGundam: Yes
[6:27:48] Shrenko: yes
[6:27:48] JinTackle: yep
[6:27:49] Kinghorn: yes
[6:27:49] Akiron_rafa: You can do the dungeon wit the NPCs, if you want
[6:27:53] DonCheech: trusts
[6:27:56] zildrog: yes
[6:27:56] DonCheech: i did them they are decent
[6:27:58] Meraut: they all right
[6:27:58] TrowGundam: But they aren't nearly as good and takes like 50% longer
[6:27:58] Akiron_rafa: its just a bit slow
[6:27:58] Kinghorn: its slow but effective
[6:27:59] Meepzter: Decent, just a bit slower
[6:27:59] JinTackle: not better than normal players
[6:27:59] WhiteKnight74648: they are ok
[6:28:00] DonCheech: lets you take your time
[6:28:02] JinTackle: but decent enough
[6:28:04] Noxryn: they're okay, slow but fine
[6:28:05] chickenwienersoup: probably better than real people
[6:28:05] Sagyi: better than some randoms
[6:28:05] Henji_Airou: They do the job
[6:28:06] Bogzeh: its good ai but its a bit slower than with players
[6:28:06] spyrit14: yes finaly fantasy 11 has the same ai
[6:28:08] CoffeeCatte: They get the job done
[6:28:08] TrowGundam: They'll get the job done, just slow
[6:28:09] slimoby: try it find out
[6:28:09] jbs1988: lower dps
[6:28:09] Kinghorn: they can teach you mechanics and shit
[6:28:09] Akiron_rafa: Its decent
[6:28:09] demon_tiem: They're kinda slow, but they work
[6:28:10] Noshpan: The AI is decent enough
[6:28:11] 3663Sharad: New concept for PUGs in wow LUL
[6:28:15] CoffeeCatte: Good for people that just want to play alone
[6:28:16] JinTackle: trusts are about 10 minutes slower than the average party
[6:28:16] Baleeted: oh no you've got a floortank
[6:28:22] Bogzeh: the ai is better than players LUL but its slower
[6:28:24] Skarrpa: good for learning encounters as they do mechanics 100% so follow them
[6:28:25] JinTackle: which is not too bad if you're a DPS with horrible queue times
[6:28:30] WhiteKnight74648: their dps is pretty bad though
[6:28:31] Thralia: clear selection
[6:28:31] Kinghorn: trusts are better than some pugs I have seen in WoW
[6:28:33] KekkePeke: they are better than really bad group of players but worse than mediocorely bad players
[6:28:34] chickenwienersoup: I hate people, maybe this is my game
[6:28:35] TrowGundam: Clear Selection
[6:28:36] tehrobtar: celar selection, @Towelliee

[6:28:46] Peekabuu: down bottom
[6:28:48] TheGaoSora: @Bogzeh How many zones do you need to do that?
[6:28:57] TheGaoSora: *in how many
[6:29:07] Shrenko: this dungeon is awesomeeee
[6:29:08] JinTackle: catJAM catJAM

[6:29:34] sLogOG: are dungeons 5men in this game too?
[6:29:39] JinTackle: 4 man
[6:29:46] Kinghorn: 2 dps 1 heal 1 tank
[6:29:49] Bogzeh: @TheOmniSora if u do it as u progress with the msq its no time at all
[6:29:50] TheGaoSora: how many are there? @Bogzeh the more you talk about it the less it sounds easy lol
[6:29:50] Noshpan: Cant wait for when they introduce cross data center travel
[6:29:54] Kamorea: I really need to transfer my character back to aether
[6:29:56] TrowGundam: 4 man dungeons, then 8 man raids and 24 man raids
[6:30:06] Kinghorn: Jebaited
[6:30:10] Baleeted: also 48-mN ROO
[6:30:20] Bogzeh: @TheOmniSora i dont know, 10-20 per zone, its maybe on hour per zone if u ignored it while doing msq
[6:30:26] JinTackle: @TheOmniSora you need to find 10 aether currents and do 5 side quests to unlock flying
[6:30:32] JinTackle: the msq leads you do them naturally though
[6:30:38] Meepzter: theres a 56 man raid aswell, old content now though but still being done
[6:30:54] Kinghorn: owl statues trying to take you out
[6:30:59] Kamorea: I love this dungeon
[6:31:03] Noshpan: Being as it's a quarter after 5 am, and I don't have to stay up for stuff, I'm off to bed. Good night Towelliee & chat
[6:31:04] Shrenko: like every boss fight in FFXIV is great and different
[6:31:14] Frames_Per_Izu: Did you story boost @Towelliee or have you done the whole thing?
[6:31:25] Baleeted: I really want to try Delebrum Savage but normal is hard enough
[6:31:28] UberManDude: @Meepzter wow
[6:31:28] chickenwienersoup: seems very flashy
[6:31:35] TheGaoSora: Sounds decent i guess but yeah, if they had it in shop they could make a lot of money lol
[6:31:39] chickenwienersoup: but I love the animation and music
[6:31:46] Shrenko: @frames_per_izu whole thing
[6:31:51] JinTackle: you can turn down most of the effects
[6:31:59] Kinghorn: meters kelpEyes
[6:32:04] Shrenko: TOS
[6:32:13] Frames_Per_Izu: Most people just run it on their stream
[6:32:15] TheGaoSora: Don't say the M word while playing FF...
[6:32:19] JinTackle: you can talk about it on twitch
[6:32:23] chickenwienersoup: just brag about doing the least amount of dps, burn it down
[6:32:23] Meepzter: its fine to have meters on sscreen, plenty of FF streamers do. Whats not allowed is talking about it ingame, calling people out in chat
[6:32:25] jbeastb: FF is a snooze fest
[6:32:28] Frames_Per_Izu: As long as you don't slander people with it

[6:33:04] Frames_Per_Izu: Makes me cry
[6:33:06] JinTackle: it does even more damage if you use requiescat
[6:33:07] TrowGundam: @Meepzter Technically but if someone got salty and reported him, even he never mentioned it they could suspend him. It has happend before when people were trolling some random small streamers
[6:33:24] LiteralZero: @Towelliee Dont forget you have a mana regen combo to get mana back
[6:33:25] TheGaoSora: I mean damage meters can help you improve in a way.. just as long as you don't use them to be toxic to others
[6:33:37] elvia_: the key is deplete now
[6:33:39] TheGaoSora: Which is what WoW elitist do the most..

[6:38:33] Shrenko: catJAM
[6:38:48] JinTackle: its good when the boss does unavoidable AoEs
[6:38:49] TrowGundam: It's good for AOE hits to mitigate party damage
[6:38:49] TheGaoSora: Clap
[6:38:52] WhiteKnight74648: <3
[6:38:55] Shrenko: Clap

[6:40:15] wazon_7: where in this game is the most important thing; damage meters? KEKW
[6:40:16] robert_332: is there a mage in this game?
[6:40:25] LiteralZero: circle of scorn is great
[6:40:27] TheGaoSora: Wait... are all instances timed?...
[6:40:29] Shrenko: @robert_332 yes many
[6:40:33] LiteralZero: @robert_332 a fair few LUL
[6:40:35] JinTackle: @robert_332 a whole rainbow of them
[6:40:36] Meepzter: @elvia_  in the fall, probably octoberish
[6:40:39] Akiron_rafa: yeah they all ar
[6:40:41] Kinghorn: red black blue
[6:40:42] LiteralZero: @TheOmniSora they have timers yeah
[6:40:46] JinTackle: got black mage, white mage, red mage, blue mage
[6:40:49] TrowGundam: @wazon_7 3rd party only and if you mention them in game, hope you don't get banned :)
[6:40:49] JinTackle: pick your poison
[6:40:52] Akiron_rafa: but its a long time
[6:40:53] Shrenko: @robert_332 red mage, black mage, white mage and blue mage
[6:41:02] iunbearable: you gotta pay for a monthly sub?
[6:41:02] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:41:07] LiteralZero: yeah
[6:41:08] wazon_7: @TrowGundam  what why?
[6:41:08] TheGaoSora: @LiteralZero do you get autokicked if it's over or is it just for a feel good thing?
[6:41:16] elvia_: @Meepzter ty
[6:41:16] robert_332: i liek the black and white mages
[6:41:25] muhbuhtuh: @iunbearable theres a free trial up to lvl 60
[6:41:26] Kinghorn: you do but it is free up to level 70! iunbearable
[6:41:27] robert_332: wait whats a blue mage?
[6:41:28] Meraut: you got an actual interrupt now
[6:41:29] Kinghorn: er 60
[6:41:30] Akiron_rafa: Montly sub is 15 bucks yeah
[6:41:32] TrowGundam: @wazon_7 Because only 3rd Party Programs do it, and they are against TOS for the game. There are no UI addons in FFXIV
[6:41:35] LiteralZero: @TheOmniSora the duty ends yeah, but you'll never hit the timer in a dungeon unless you AFK for ages, theyre all like an hour  +
[6:41:38] Tages: Blue mage is magic copied from monsters
[6:41:38] CoffeeCatte: Spirits Within now just gets you some MP back
[6:41:41] JinTackle: 15 or 13 for the cheaper sub
[6:41:43] Kinghorn: up to heavensward
[6:41:52] wazon_7: @TrowGundam that sucks a lot wtf
[6:41:52] LiteralZero: @Kinghorn 60 but yeah
[6:41:53] DatHippoCat: @Towelliee No it just looks like the interrupt ability on the top right of your bar KEKW
[6:42:01] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  wait until u learn Confiteor
[6:42:03] Kinghorn: look I just woke up LiteralZero kelpLUL
[6:42:07] LiteralZero: LUL
[6:42:08] LiteralZero: me too
[6:42:08] iunbearable: Oh okay thank you @muhbuhtuh & @Kinghorn <3
[6:42:10] doomester: @Towelliee if wow dies for any reason, FFIXV will be the way to go :)
[6:42:12] TrowGundam: @wazon_7 They really aren't necessary. As long as you complete content, who cares how much damage you do?
[6:42:13] TheGaoSora: @LiteralZero So raids have longer timers?
[6:42:13] Kinghorn: numbers are hard need more wake up juice
[6:42:21] Laskyplnix: Is this game worth it? By the looks of it it seems very confusing
[6:42:23] LiteralZero: @TheOmniSora yeah yeah and you can just reenter
[6:42:32] LiteralZero: @Laskyplnix try the free trial!
[6:42:37] TheGaoSora: but you'll have to reclear no?
[6:42:38] Sandman_88: @Laskyplnix Free trial, take a peak for yourself
[6:42:38] LiteralZero: sorry i'll stop shilling LUL
[6:42:38] CardinalTX: Have never play FF      worth 20 on steam?      sub but a free trial going ya?
[6:42:40] MasaruMichi: how many hours did it took you to reach this level?
[6:42:43] JinTackle: @TheOmniSora most raids have a 90 minute timer, while the harder ones like ultimate have 120
[6:42:50] Mallaes: 🦇
[6:42:50] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[6:42:50] wazon_7: @TrowGundam idk, most competitive people probably? how else can you tell which class/spec is the strongest for certain content? (Aoe, bosses etc)
[6:42:56] MagicMooseMoo: @towelliee what brought u to try ff14 again,just a change of pace?
[6:43:12] Kinghorn: probably almost 200 hours MasaruMichi
[6:43:13] TrowGundam: @Tacoma64 Free sub up to the end of Heavensward, the first expansion, so 100s of hours of content in the demo
[6:43:20] DatHippoCat: @Laskyplnix It is not confusing if you play from the start. FF14 was my first MMO. It is very beginner friendly
[6:43:30] Kinghorn: eh less probably
[6:43:31] Bogzeh: new expac this fall
[6:43:35] Shrenko: @Tacoma64 you can play for free up to lvl 60 I think with the first expansion. took me like 200+ hours to finish Heavensward which is amazing. you should follow the story1
[6:43:42] Sandman_88: love how PLD gets 2 stuns
[6:43:42] spyrit14: I played final fantasy 11 for four years
[6:43:42] Tages: heal too
[6:43:44] JinTackle: clemency
[6:43:47] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  heal
[6:43:48] evilkillejr: clemency
[6:43:51] Bogzeh: in this game u have to do ALL previous content to play the latest expac
[6:43:51] JinTackle: it heals you for more under requiescat
[6:43:57] Frames_Per_Izu: You get a level 80 skill called Conflitior
[6:43:58] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  no it makes it instant
[6:44:05] TrowGundam: @wazon_7 People do use it, it is kind of an open secret. But mentioning them in game can and probably will get you banned. Plus this game is on PS4, and that is mainly why there are no addons
[6:44:16] Frames_Per_Izu: Which is a combo ender to the magic rotation
[6:44:28] Kinghorn: no tank loot kelpHeck
[6:44:31] Sandman_88: lol Batsquantch

[6:44:54] jaysteea: shriekwing?
[6:44:58] kharnij83: did they prune skills by alot. there was way to many buttons to push
[6:44:59] TrowGundam: Watch for the shadow on the pillars
[6:45:02] Kinghorn: usually good life advice
[6:45:05] Sandman_88: mad bat
[6:45:06] KekkePeke: dodge bad

[6:45:19] Kinghorn: kelpSmug JewelsVR
[6:45:20] TheGaoSora: @TrowGundam That's the fun part about FF, you can play whatever the hecc you want. And honestly i'm not sure if there's any big competitive scene in this game which is also great coz less toxicisty and crap like meta
[6:45:20] 3663Sharad: catJam
[6:45:21] Alegnowar: catJAM
[6:45:25] Kinghorn: IonJam
[6:45:31] metavahn231: lots of shit gonna fall
[6:45:32] Shrenko: @Tacoma64 yeah the story is just amaazing. it starts really slow but its worth it in the long run
[6:45:35] justicewhip33: is this the ingame music
[6:45:40] Sandman_88: ye
[6:45:41] Shrenko: catJAM
[6:45:42] ashcrow232: @justicewhip33  yes
[6:45:43] LiteralZero: yea
[6:45:54] justicewhip33: thats cool
[6:45:59] MasaruMichi: tank busters then aoe skill i like the pattern xD
[6:45:59] Sandman_88: it slaps
[6:46:00] JinTackle: there is a meta composition for speedruns and such, but for regular hard content pugging everything is viable
[6:46:03] LiteralZero: Chat, I love seeing XIV fans in Towellies chat, y'all are great <3
[6:46:14] Kinghorn: until they fall on your head

[6:47:05] Kinghorn: mhmm
[6:47:05] TrowGundam: Yes
[6:47:08] JinTackle: the playerbase is just not very interested in steams
[6:47:10] Kinghorn: they will 1 hsot ya
[6:47:12] evilkillejr: people enjoy playing the game rather than watching it
[6:47:16] Kinghorn: well not a tank
[6:47:18] JinTackle: other than when a new ultimate or savage raid comes out
[6:47:37] evilkillejr: plus, it's not exactly a great game to stream
[6:47:40] metavahn231: they delayed ultimate for more important content Kappa
[6:47:40] TrowGundam: @elvia_ not all popular games catch on on Twitch.
[6:47:43] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  have  you played 11  too or just 14?
[6:47:49] MasaruMichi: I miss the game already but it sucks not to have pre party for the verses
[6:48:07] KekkePeke: @elvia_ because SE dont tell the real sub amount. only accounts created, and majority of players are at least borderline RPers
[6:48:13] Kinghorn: gear PogChamp
[6:48:17] idenkaz_: gear Pog
[6:48:19] ShadoodHD: damn you drg stop jumping to nonsense

[6:48:41] im_malding: right click compare
[6:48:41] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  right click compare
[6:48:48] evilkillejr: majority of players aren't rpers...
[6:48:50] TrowGundam: So it is better
[6:48:50] Frames_Per_Izu: Its a upgrade
[6:48:59] JinTackle: the active sub count is assumed to be around a million
[6:49:04] TheGaoSora: Choker Kreygasm
[6:49:11] metavahn231: just hit recommended gear button and go with the flow
[6:49:15] JinTackle: SE did a lot of marketing for this expansion, and they're doing a lot of marketing for the next one too
[6:49:16] Tages: top left button to auto equip
[6:49:18] Kinghorn: just hit recommend gear
[6:49:21] Kinghorn: EZ
[6:49:22] LiteralZero: @Towelliee Little blue icon above your weapon equips best gear for you
[6:49:26] KekkePeke: @Reap14 but i said borderline. you know the people who just afk/chat in major cities
[6:49:31] MasaruMichi: its once u fnish
[6:49:32] Bogzeh: hit icon above your weapon
[6:49:34] MasaruMichi: i think
[6:49:36] metavahn231: recomended gear does it for oyu
[6:49:38] KekkePeke: rather than playing the game
[6:49:41] Reap14: @KekkePeke Yea but you find that in every mmo
[6:49:41] LiteralZero: Jebaited apparently
[6:49:48] Tanthalanis: It's in your inventory
[6:49:49] Keilali: its in your normal inventory
[6:49:49] xristakios: it is your inventory
[6:49:49] CoffeeCatte: @Towelliee It went into your Iventory and not the Armory Chest
[6:49:50] ryderthewriter: ccheck your inventory
[6:49:51] sorwa: check normal inventory
[6:49:54] Jakosin: its in your inventory
[6:49:55] TrowGundam: It might have gone into your inventory
[6:49:56] referee_nis: its lvl 75
[6:50:02] ashcrow232: inventory not armorhy chest
[6:50:06] Obskures: its in your bag not armory chest. there is an option to put it there first so you dont clog your bags
[6:50:08] Jakosin: you can change that if you want in settings
[6:50:12] JinTackle: you can change it so it'll drop in your armory
[6:50:14] Akiron_rafa: wow you have a lot of gear in your inv LUL
[6:50:19] JinTackle: personally i like when it drops to the inventory
[6:50:21] metavahn231: why is his gear going to inventory and not armoy lol
[6:50:26] Jakosin: PogChamp
[6:50:29] NexiNet: if you think it will help, you can pitch your camera up and down by holding ctrl and hitting your up/down arrows, is useful for keeping bosses more central in the camera frame
[6:50:29] FirebirdEx: holy shit
[6:50:30] JinTackle: there's a setting for that @elixirfield1
[6:50:32] Sandman_88: Big Pog
[6:50:32] Tages: armory must be full
[6:50:33] demon_tiem: N'zoth PogChamp
[6:50:34] ashcrow232: @elixirfield1  no idea
[6:50:35] mett7: only 100 item levels to catch up Kappa
[6:50:35] Keilali: @elixirfield1 extra setting
[6:50:39] Sandman_88: @Tages ye
[6:50:43] metavahn231: thats dumb ahah
[6:50:43] TrowGundam: @elixirfield1 It's an option. I have it set that way to make it easier to desynth
[6:50:43] BadWolf0920: i haven't been around for a minute, why no camera?
[6:50:45] JinTackle: or his necklace slots are full
[6:50:45] ashcrow232: omg this part is cool
[6:50:46] Akiron_rafa: thats a config you can se if it goes to the inv or the Armoury
[6:50:52] metavahn231: for general play i guess
[6:51:08] metavahn231: water world POGGERS
[6:51:15] BearKitty69: !lurk
[6:51:23] Darkstar_Universe: always loved the soundtrack of the game. good music. im no weeb but surprisingly enjoyed this game.
[6:51:25] TrowGundam: @BadWolf0920 He's taking medicine that makes it so he can't wear a shirt
[6:51:29] KekkePeke: @Reap14 yea you're right but, anyways main main point was that the SE don't tell sub count, only the accounts createxc
[6:51:32] valth: hey FF. nice reminds me i have to log in and finish leveling my gunbreaker job lol
[6:51:33] aloken1312: i dont know why but i just cant vibe with FFXIV graphics and game overall :/
[6:51:34] Alegnowar: it looks very cool
[6:51:47] Shrenko: they're awesome
[6:51:49] Sandman_88: yep
[6:51:51] JinTackle: p much
[6:51:57] TrowGundam: ya, they do really good at setting the atmosphere
[6:51:58] BadWolf0920: thanks for the update @TrowGundam
[6:51:58] JinTackle: wait til you get to the level 80 dungeons
[6:52:00] Meepzter: They are not hard, they are casual content
[6:52:03] Azphelle: I'm taking a break from FFXIV atm...by playing blade and soul..........apparently I hate myself.
[6:52:07] WhiteKnight74648: its relaxing
[6:52:07] Noxryn: nah they aren't very hard it's basically wall to wall and fall asleep at the wheel
[6:52:07] TheGaoSora: wish the boss encounters weren't always in a round arena..
[6:52:08] Kinghorn: in wow the story is to get to the dungeon, in ffxiv the dungeons are to get to the story
[6:52:10] Baleeted: wait till you do the stuff at the end of 5.0 stuff
[6:52:12] Tages: not that hard so much pull more packs
[6:52:13] spyrit14: Final fantasy 11 was brutal
[6:52:13] TrowGundam: The dungeons aren't the difficult content. That is for Savage and Ultimate
[6:52:15] FirebirdEx: savage trials
[6:52:20] metavahn231: people have been asking for that
[6:52:22] ashcrow232: @Towelliee   yea thats the only sad part about it, alot of player are asking a + system for dungeons,
[6:52:22] ShadoodHD: its hard enough as it is
[6:52:26] ShadoodHD: NotLikeThis
[6:52:29] JinTackle: they tried something similar with bozja
[6:52:30] Baleeted: SoS EX was brutal when 5.3 came out
[6:52:31] yibbus: Hi how's your morning going Towelliee
[6:52:32] Lycam: @Towelliee Well WoW picked it up from Fractals in GW2
[6:52:36] anacronz: there is no pvp in this game damn
[6:52:40] JinTackle: there's a 48 man savage dungeon out atm
[6:52:40] Sandman_88: you havent done that stuff Towel
[6:52:41] Noxryn: devs said before they don't want to deal with balancing around mythic+ dungeons
[6:52:44] Akiron_rafa: There is one
[6:52:46] Bogzeh: most ppl play this for the story, dont think enough care for something like that in this game
[6:52:48] evilkillejr: there is 100% pvp
[6:52:51] Noxryn: wish they would tho
[6:52:51] metavahn231: the dungeons are just like casual shit to them
[6:52:52] TrowGundam: Nah, Yoshi-P has said they want people to be able to take a break between patches. They purposefully designed the game to let people play for a month or two after a patch and then take a break till the next major patch
[6:52:53] Reap14: @anacronz There is pvp. It isn't the focus of the game though.
[6:52:59] Akiron_rafa: DR Savage
[6:52:59] Shrenko: the gear progression in FFXIV doesnt really fits for a M+ system
[6:52:59] Meepzter: There is not really room for rewards for harder dungeons with the reward structure they have in place
[6:53:01] Henji_Airou: @baleeted not really, it's just an ex trial
[6:53:03] TheGaoSora: @anacronz there is, it's just a niche, which helps with balancing imo
[6:53:07] anacronz: how there is pvp while i w8 for 2 hours in que
[6:53:09] anacronz: ?
[6:53:10] ravagekiller12: why no face cam
[6:53:11] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  the only problem with this game endgame is Savage  8 man raids, there is no middle ground for mid tier
[6:53:21] JinTackle: mid tier is extreme primals pretty much
[6:53:22] Reap14: @anacronz There is an event going on right now and pvp queues are 5m.
[6:53:26] Alegnowar: M+ are just glorified Grifts from D3
[6:53:26] Stonefather: Anthem Next danSad
[6:53:27] Baleeted: @Henji_Airou when it first came out and no one was geared up? I remember people struggling with the normal trial and getting 8+ wipes
[6:53:28] Sandman_88: Anthem KEKW
[6:53:29] Henji_Airou: @bogzeh plenty of people raid. I'm sure the interest is there
[6:53:29] evilkillejr: your que is bugged
[6:53:39] Noxryn: DR Savage is a raid moreso than a dungeon tbh @Akiron_rafa
[6:53:41] sMoKe2501: Cant wait till Anthem comes out!
[6:53:43] xristakios: keep. going
[6:53:47] evilkillejr: or just trolling
[6:53:47] Zettabyte: Anthem Next RIP
[6:53:49] doomester: @Towelliee The Division has a weekly chest like WOW
[6:53:49] ravagekiller12: why no face cam today
[6:53:54] Baleeted: obviously it's a lot easier now, but when it released it was hard af
[6:53:57] anacronz: they gonna add any compative pvp ? with gear rewards
[6:54:17] evilkillejr: there is competitive pvp....

[6:54:18] JinTackle: yikes LUL
[6:54:20] spyrit14: wait they got rid of the pvp in FFXIV?
[6:54:21] Kinghorn: nobody tell him
[6:54:22] Akiron_rafa: thats true @Noxryn but its the closest one
[6:54:22] Henji_Airou: @baleeted sure but that was just because of the LB. Doesn't make the encounter itself difficult
[6:54:25] SlayerLightStorm: @anacronz Anthem got copmpletely scrapped.
[6:54:27] Meraut: @anacronz 14 has arena pvp content and it has for years lol
[6:54:33] Sandman_88: @spyrit14 lol no
[6:54:39] FirebirdEx: @Towelliee the ultimate raids are the hardest challenge in the game, can last 20 min and if there is only 1 mistake you have to redo all
[6:54:45] JinTackle: pvp is still getting updates in xiv
[6:54:47] JinTackle: and new rewards too
[6:54:56] kharnij83: hopefully riot doesnt shit the bed on their MMO
[6:54:56] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/ODsxw67GYJw TBC #somechanges
[6:54:57] JinTackle: it's just not as popular as PvE
[6:54:57] Alegnowar: why canning something that could have made the whole anthem project worthwhile?
[6:54:58] KekkePeke: they could remove pvp from 14 and nobody would see the difference KEKW
[6:54:58] Baleeted: @Henji_Airou nah, there are plenty of things that wiped parties and not just the LB. it's cool if you didn't struggle at all but lots of people did
[6:54:59] Noxryn: @Akiron_rafa i feel like deep dungeons would be closer, technically but still not quite the same
[6:55:00] Sandman_88: SinPoop
[6:55:03] anacronz: the rewards are only cosmetics right?
[6:55:06] Kinghorn: firing their lasers
[6:55:06] ashcrow232: @KekkePeke  so true lol
[6:55:17] evilkillejr: no
[6:55:19] Sandman_88: @KekkePeke too true KEKW
[6:55:19] Dvmaaren: the music in ffxiv is so good
[6:55:19] spyrit14: I wish SE put in ballista in FFXIV, it was really fun in FXI
[6:55:26] TrowGundam: @KekkePeke I'm sure there'd be a few that would. I woudln't be one of them rooKek
[6:55:34] Reap14: I know its crazy folks but some people enjoy things that you don't enjoy. Some people DO enjoy ffxiv pvp.
[6:55:34] JinTackle: pvp is actually pretty hot right now because of an event thats going
[6:55:39] ashcrow232: @spyrit14  OMG I LOVE BALISTA IN FFXI i still play ffxi, but REdmage is so fucking overpowered in balista
[6:55:47] Shrenko: good luck
[6:55:51] TrowGundam: Nah, you gotta do the Savage and Ultimate raids. Ultimate Raids are punishing af
[6:55:51] metavahn231: ARR was just extremely slow
[6:55:52] Sandman_88: Start at alexander
[6:55:54] metavahn231: not hard
[6:55:58] Kinghorn: yeah been watching his progress raids been fun
[6:55:59] Henji_Airou: JP is doing the savage raids yeah
[6:56:06] JinTackle: did JP beat 11 yet
[6:56:06] Noxryn: savage is pretty fun tbh
[6:56:11] KekkePeke: @TrowGundam yea there is people who likes Lords of vermillion but who cares KEKW
[6:56:17] Meepzter: Ultimates are the hardest content. Takes roughly a group 150+ hours to clear, many months of progress
[6:56:18] CoffeeCatte: @Towelliee Extreme Trials and Savage 8 Man's along with the Ultimate Fights.
[6:56:24] Henji_Airou: @jintackle not the last time I checked
[6:56:28] ashcrow232: i  loved early ARR gameplay :X
[6:56:35] Sandman_88: monkaS
[6:56:37] muhbuhtuh: awoooo
[6:56:40] spyrit14: I would sub dark in ballista use a level 1 dagger chainspell> aspire a BLM and beat them up with my level 1 dagger and enblizzard so funny
[6:56:40] JinTackle: monkaS
[6:56:42] Gorestack: you wish
[6:56:43] JinTackle: not wrong tbh
[6:56:44] FirebirdEx: Booba
[6:56:46] iunbearable: BOOBA
[6:56:48] Tanthalanis: The dog can have tits, why can't it?
[6:56:49] heal_master: when come in hardcore i think ultimate is the best
[6:56:50] SlayerLightStorm: That, is a chimera.
[6:56:53] mett7: no booba, no boss!
[6:56:54] maccaruso: Those are called femalesa
[6:56:55] Keilali: it could still have boobs Kappa
[6:56:56] JinTackle: dont die :)
[6:56:59] metavahn231: cerebru's son
[6:57:01] ashcrow232: @spyrit14  have u seen the new  odin and lilith fights?
[6:57:04] evilkillejr: imagine ending every sentence with KEKW like a cat furry saying ~meow
[6:57:05] Shrenko: catJAM
[6:57:05] Sathalan: I can confirm that this giant puppy light warden has toe beans midnit29UwU
[6:57:07] Henji_Airou: @meepzter 150?? You'd have to be doing blind prog and not looking up guides for that.
[6:57:17] metavahn231: i think he just jumps around alot
[6:57:25] 3663Sharad: catJAM catJAM catJAM

[7:00:56] Sandman_88: Clap
[7:00:58] JinTackle: PogChamp
[7:01:02] Remvarian: You can use arm's length to negate the push also @towelliee
[7:01:08] JinTackle: also gap close
[7:01:23] TrowGundam: I think that push back ignores arm's length. I know there are some that do
[7:01:25] JinTackle: if you time it right
[7:01:25] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  use ur limit break for fun!

[7:02:21] metavahn231: healer almost got 1 shot LUL
[7:02:27] nikoiinka: @Lantern214 do they really ban for using it, though? it feels like they only ban if you use dmg meter to tell somone they suck. like if you want to know if you are doing fine, you can use it.
[7:02:28] ashcrow232: @Tacoma64  there is inbetween abbilities
[7:02:38] JinTackle: will he pull it off PogChamp

[7:03:04] ashcrow232: @nikoiinka   u can get banned if u degrade people with their dps through parser lol
[7:03:07] gargakan: gargakan subscribed with Prime. 
[7:03:08] TrowGundam: @nikoiinka If you mention it in game, is about the only time you'll get suspended, and even then only if oyu get reported, which is more likely if you are being toxic
[7:03:09] Reap14: They don't ban if you use it. If you publicly shame someone and they report you then yes they ban you
[7:03:12] FirebirdEx: FF14 music is so fkn good
[7:03:14] JinTackle: level up PogChamp

[7:05:44] FirebirdEx: your limit break is under general @Towelliee
[7:05:50] JinTackle: and only under requiestcat
[7:05:51] TrowGundam: Ya, just no casting time which makes it easier to use on the move
[7:05:57] JinTackle: without it it casts as normal
[7:06:05] RidicUlust: great for uptime
[7:06:08] JinTackle: it'll be instant yep

[7:06:21] WhiteKnight74648: read the last part of it
[7:06:22] Noxryn: confiteor ends req
[7:06:22] TrowGundam: Rec ends when you use Confiteor

[7:06:35] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  u end ur combo with thsi after spaming holy circle
[7:06:36] JinTackle: you do 5 holy spirits and then confetior
[7:06:37] mizukami__BR: 4 holy spirit into confeteor
[7:06:38] CoffeeCatte: @Towelliee No.  It can only be used while under that certain effect.  Using it removes that effect
[7:06:39] JinTackle: err 4
[7:06:40] ShadoodHD: ends your requiescate
[7:06:45] Remvarian: Don't forget to add Arm's length from under the role skills

[7:09:22] Shrenko: Shadowbringers story is so good @Towelliee made me teary at the end
[7:09:22] Remvarian: It'll buff out Kappa
[7:09:36] Noxryn: dw about it : )

[7:09:59] Sandman_88: @WhiteKnight74648 good heal helping
[7:10:05] WhiteKnight74648: @Sandman_88 <3
[7:10:12] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  the next dungeon mechanics is awesome
[7:10:24] WhiteKnight74648: @Sandman_88 I had my moment with the rescue lol
[7:10:25] Noxryn: there's like none comparatively
[7:10:32] MasaruMichi: yup the end game raids and dungeons are quite awesome
[7:10:36] JinTackle: about right
[7:10:41] Nazuqi: there is only 1 pull between each boss in ff14 :)
[7:10:43] JinTackle: its 2-3 mob packs then boss fight
[7:10:47] TrowGundam: You have 4 packs between each boss. Most people pull 2 packs at a time. FFXIV dungeons are VERY fomulaic
[7:10:49] P1ght: @Towelliee maybe a bossrush could work in ff14. just bossted bosses in a+ system
[7:10:49] Tages: these are kinda basic for casuals to grind easy
[7:10:50] Akiron_rafa: Yeah and people normally pull wall to wall so it goes faster
[7:10:52] Baleeted: after ARR they decided to get rid of them
[7:10:55] FirebirdEx: they dont waste your time with trash mobs in FF
[7:10:57] Remvarian: They used to do hard mode dungeons in the past that changed them up. maybe they could return to that.
[7:10:59] NexiNet: I think there's things they could do to add challenge but it would be mechanical, things like getting hit by the poison on the last boss stays permanently and stuff
[7:11:03] Sandman_88: different MMO styles. :)

[7:11:04] WhiteKnight74648: Ast is such a fun job cause i get to boost dps of others while im healing
[7:11:12] JinTackle: thats what everyone do :)
[7:11:14] Noxryn: yeah that's the general strat for tanks
[7:11:14] forcegamerrr: Why is Illidan so excited? I just got here...
[7:11:17] JinTackle: or expected to do
[7:11:20] DaemonIV: cuz the game isn't about mindlessly pulling trash and the bosses matter
[7:11:23] Kromede: ff14 ResidentSleeper
[7:11:24] Meepzter: nobody likes trash, so im glad its very small amount of it, and none of it at all in raids
[7:11:28] JinTackle: unless your healer is asleep
[7:11:29] Lelomak: i main pld in this game most healers expect big pulls tbh
[7:11:36] TrowGundam: most people will pull two packs, sometimes all 4, if the healer is able to keep up. I woudln't do all 4 with an AST personally though, they can't always keep up
[7:11:37] KodyTheTyger: ff14 PogChamp
[7:11:39] ashcrow232: @Towelliee  there was many trash in the original ARR do you remamber, but the japanese players started doing something like pulling all adds to the boss entrance, and keeping em out of room while some 1 pull boss it resets the adds, so they decided to change the foruma lol
[7:11:41] Shrenko: @Kromede toxic!!!
[7:11:53] Grinok84: In Wow we have trash packs that are harder then bosses to, witch makes no sense
[7:11:58] Kromede: Shrenko D:
[7:11:58] Noxryn: doing end game dungeons with no healer on warrior goin wall to wall feelsgood

[7:23:09] mett7: man created
[7:23:10] ShadoodHD: Gods are made by faith, makes sense Kappa
[7:23:12] TheGaoSora: Primals = elementals?..
[7:23:16] JinTackle: zodiark tempered the ascians, like a primal tempers the beast tribes
[7:23:19] CDubTheRIPper: cohhNotes
[7:23:19] Bogzeh: no different than primals, just the first and stronger

[7:23:44] rhsiuol: so ffxiv is the main lore?
[7:23:46] TrowGundam: @TheOmniSora Primals are beings made of pure Aether and shaped by the beliefs of their worshippers
[7:23:46] Bogzeh: source + 13 shards
[7:23:48] Sleepy_Platypus: same thing @Towelliee  primal = gods  (they are aspect of a single thing   here zodiark = dark and light is hydaline)
[7:23:49] WhiteKnight74648: he doesnt
[7:23:49] JinTackle: it'll be explained
[7:23:50] Vexxsis: the both did

[7:24:09] Vexxsis: they both exploded
[7:24:16] Azphelle: the other worlds aren't any reference to any of the other games, as some of those other planets have already been destroyed due to the Ascians plans
[7:24:29] JinTackle: 8 stars were already destroyed

[7:24:42] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[7:24:43] metavahn231: isnt it called sundering or something
[7:24:45] Eludi: you can think of it this way, zodiark was "made" from energy of the world, so if he explode to pieces, so does the world
[7:24:49] CDubTheRIPper: pikaOMG
[7:24:49] ShadoodHD: BibleThump

[7:25:08] Jakosin: i mean wows jaws are on a whole other level of movement
[7:25:12] JinTackle: reminder that zodiark did nothing wrong :)
[7:25:19] Eludi: rejoining all the 14 worlds back to 1
[7:25:20] ShadoodHD: rejoining all the worlds
[7:25:20] Vexxsis: zod rez
[7:25:20] FirebirdEx: rejoining of the world
[7:25:20] Noxryn: rejoining all the worlds back to one
[7:25:21] BartonLua: the shards
[7:25:24] LiteralZero: bring shard together again
[7:25:24] TrowGundam: Bringing all the shards back into the soruce so the world can be whole
[7:25:27] Remvarian: of the worlds
[7:25:27] Azphelle: Nah, rejoining all of the worlds back into the original world
[7:25:27] Bogzeh: they bring the worlds back together through calamities @Towelliee
[7:25:32] Akiron_rafa: The 14 words/shards
[7:25:32] Cecile_Valdelius: all world, each world as the source o ours is one part
[7:25:37] zeychs: @Towelliee causing calamaties to bring them together
[7:25:40] Bogzeh: but thats means millions die each time
[7:25:42] Cecile_Valdelius: but rejoin mean everyone on those worlds die
[7:25:43] Vexxsis: no
[7:25:44] FirebirdEx: correct
[7:25:45] Azphelle: but that means that every single living thing would be destroyed
[7:25:47] JinTackle: no and yes
[7:25:50] idenkaz_: something like that yea
[7:25:52] Vexxsis: they both exploded
[7:25:54] TrowGundam: Hydalen is like asleep
[7:25:57] Akiron_rafa: She talks to you yeah
[7:25:58] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee when hydalen defeated zodiarc, hydalen split the worlds to contain zodiark. only by rejoining all the worlds can they bring back zodiark.
[7:25:58] JinTackle: hydaelyn is weakened by the primals though
[7:25:59] BartonLua: @Azphelle it'll be explained later
[7:26:06] JinTackle: because the primals sap her life force
[7:26:07] metavahn231: minfilla joined with hydalen
[7:26:12] Azphelle: @Azphelle I know, I play ;p
[7:26:13] PlaguedV: find out more in endwalker LULW
[7:26:19] ShadoodHD: the First
[7:26:19] zeychs: the 1st
[7:26:20] JinTackle: the 1st
[7:26:20] FirebirdEx: on the first
[7:26:20] TrowGundam: This is the 1st
[7:26:21] Eludi: currently on the 1st
[7:26:21] P1ght: 1.
[7:26:22] BartonLua: 1st
[7:26:23] Vexxsis: she was was weakened
[7:26:24] Shrenko: the 1st
[7:26:26] yibbus: the first shard
[7:26:27] abracka_: we
[7:26:27] Frames_Per_Izu: The First
[7:26:27] Bogzeh: first of the 13 shards
[7:26:28] ShadoodHD: yes
[7:26:29] Akiron_rafa: FIrst after the source
[7:26:31] Lelomak: the first
[7:26:33] JinTackle: the world farthest away from zordiark and closest to hydaelyn
[7:26:33] zeychs: no
[7:26:34] FirebirdEx: yes
[7:26:35] PlaguedV: no
[7:26:35] TrowGundam: ummm no
[7:26:36] BartonLua: no
[7:26:36] ShadoodHD: no
[7:26:38] abracka_: no no
[7:26:43] Azphelle: your original world is the Source
[7:26:44] Frames_Per_Izu: Nah
[7:26:45] Akiron_rafa: no
[7:26:45] JinTackle: the 13th is the farthest away from hydaelyn and closest to zodiark
[7:26:46] Lelomak: also 5.5 is the end of this entire story arc supposedly
[7:26:49] JinTackle: and the 13 is the void
[7:26:51] PlaguedV: its just controlled by primodial light
[7:26:51] Bogzeh: the balance of light and dark is off
[7:26:53] klkevinkl: the first is corrupted by too much light
[7:26:53] Eludi: its controlled by light, which is controlled by no one
[7:26:54] Noxryn: the story goes into it a bit more as it continues
[7:26:55] ShadoodHD: light is like primodial, not controlled hence the lightwardens
[7:26:59] Lelomak: 6.0 is a whole new thing with the gareleans
[7:27:02] Vexxsis: yeah 13 is all darkness
[7:27:03] zeychs: its like the 13 wasnt controlled by zodiark but had a flood of darkness, same thing here
[7:27:06] ShadoodHD: think of it... like the darkness in the void
[7:27:10] JinTackle: the 1st is closest to hydaelyn, hence all the light
[7:27:17] CoffeeCatte: @Towelliee The first.  Your character is from the Source.  All the worlds are fragments of your world.
[7:27:19] zeychs: All this will be super further explained soon
[7:27:26] TrowGundam: The 13th wasn't always the Void though, it was made that way because the Ascians screwed up
[7:27:26] zeychs: and how the rejoinings work
[7:27:27] metavahn231: is the source in the middle then?
[7:27:34] Baleeted: Yes
[7:27:35] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Meepzter (warning)
[7:27:45] zeychs: no
[7:27:47] FirebirdEx: no
[7:27:49] Vexxsis: no
[7:27:51] TrowGundam: No
[7:27:51] ShadoodHD: nope
[7:27:51] CoffeeCatte: No
[7:27:52] BartonLua: no just the light
[7:27:53] Lokeis: no
[7:27:54] ShadoodHD: but more can be explained in the next quest
[7:27:55] Kromede: yes
[7:27:56] JinTackle: LUL
[7:28:00] zeychs: its like wild light not formed and created like her
[7:28:04] TrowGundam: You are just absorbing Astral/Light aspected Aether
[7:28:04] Vexxsis: you already have her blessing
[7:28:05] JinTackle: she gives you her power through the blessing of light
[7:28:14] JinTackle: you don't need to absorb her per se
[7:28:21] metavahn231: its just raw light energy, so probably bad
[7:28:23] FirebirdEx: XP hype
[7:28:26] Zerafian: hey guys, I use to watch towellliee all the time and just started watching him again. I dont want to ask him directly but is there a reason he doesnt use him cam anymore?
[7:28:34] Sleepy_Platypus: nope just like absorbing fire doesent mean you are absorbing raganaros @Towelliee
[7:28:40] ashcrow232: #HYPE new dungeon @77
[7:28:47] JinTackle: !cam
[7:28:47] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[7:28:49] JinTackle: @Zerafian
[7:28:52] Shrenko: !cam @Zerafian
[7:28:55] ashcrow232: @Akiron_rafa  this coming dungeon is one of my favourites, at low levels!
[7:29:21] Vexxsis: yeah light is just another element, like wind, fire ect
[7:29:24] MyNameIsVortex: !cam
[7:29:24] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while

[7:30:04] metavahn231: light and dark just wanna eclipse each other
[7:30:06] ShadoodHD: thanks for strimmin sir
[7:30:06] CoffeeCatte: @Towelliee Doing the quest colored Blue with a little Plus in the bottom left corner normally unlocks stuff, in this case Aether Currents so you can fly in the zone once you have them all.
[7:30:07] FirebirdEx: :)
[7:30:09] WhiteKnight74648: TY for the dungeon
[7:30:09] Baleeted: It’s complicated, but it’s all explained later on
