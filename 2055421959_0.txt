[2:07:35] pharmztko: so
[2:07:37] Lberry3s: @nutz_hang_uneven doesn’t deserve an ass beating
[2:07:41] adcendless: @cdewx we dont know the full story , half of the truth is a full lie we can never know what happened
[2:07:42] dropbombsss: @nutz_hang_uneven bro you said that 5 times whats your point
[2:07:43] infernion: Someone being high, drunk or obnoxious as hell, doesn't make it legal to assault them...
[2:07:55] Qdubbz: who cares if he was fkd up lol
[2:08:00] nutz_hang_uneven: we agree to disagree i guess
[2:08:04] healmeshammy: who?

[2:08:33] dakamf: Mitch is known to lie tho into his favor of the public.
[2:08:33] Traveler1353: People are too quick to support violence when intoxication is involved
[2:08:34] thothoflau: how old chuck is, guys?
[2:08:36] rmp_lol: that's just braindead logic @nutz_hang_uneven
[2:08:36] Cybernytez: its so weird on twitter they all shittalk mitch and wish him so bad things these people are insane
[2:08:40] tehguruu: when does fighting ever solve anything
[2:08:43] OjBarnes: Yeah being a dick doesn't warrant being assaulted....
[2:08:43] Bombaclaet_Rogue: did he get a beating or just a punch in the face for beeing a dick?
[2:08:47] nutz_hang_uneven: lmao everyone @ me
[2:08:48] Aimed57: chuck is a hugger <3
[2:08:49] adcendless: @cdewx what if mitch threw the first punch and failed and the other dude just beat him
[2:08:51] gracioussatan: man some people are detached from reality that they have no sense of what's legal or illegal
[2:08:52] robertloblaw: @nutz_hang_uneven you're a weird fellow with your weird takes
[2:08:57] Swishinn: think the guy is just a mitch hater
[2:09:02] nutz_hang_uneven: stop @ me lmaooo

[2:09:13] dooshken: You're the one who brought it up bro
[2:09:14] healmeshammy: what did he do?
[2:09:17] Blackington27: @nutz_hang_uneven find something more interesting than twitch streamer drama to occupy your life
[2:09:24] nutz_hang_uneven: guys stop @ me
[2:09:30] gracioussatan: dude just be quiet
[2:09:30] Cybernytez: ive never seen mitch do harm to anyone or even flinch
[2:09:31] thothoflau: how old cdew is guys?
[2:09:32] thinkablelol: if some1 says they're killing my fam, at that moment, idk how I'll act.
[2:09:35] adcendless: @cdewx "Texas is one of only two states that allow individuals to engage in a physical altercation if both consent to the fight. The Lone Star State and Washington both have laws that make mutual combat legal."
[2:09:37] Crawf6: because the unedited video prob shows mitch started it
[2:09:38] Qtpiextclolz: @nutz_hang_uneven just @ ing you for being cray
[2:09:46] nutz_hang_uneven: I never said that
[2:09:48] dooshken: That guy just doesnt like Mitch
[2:09:59] lukex20duelist: @nutz_hang_uneven u kinda did tho
[2:10:02] Cybernytez: these people are so weird these day assault is assault man
[2:10:10] Lberry3s: @nutz_hang_uneven you def did
[2:10:11] nutz_hang_uneven: I never said that he deserved it
[2:10:15] dakamf: He instigated first it's clear form the clip
[2:10:21] Dizzlx: if anything 'friends' get more leeway when not in their right minds
[2:10:22] Swishinn: @nutz_hang_uneven this will tell you all you need to know @cdewx
[2:10:24] robertloblaw: @nutz_hang_uneven you insinuated it like he said
[2:10:28] blinoz: yo what happened to mtich ?
[2:10:28] Aimed57: @nutz_hang_uneven you actually did say he finally got what he deserved lmao
[2:10:29] Swishinn: he definitely says he deserved it lol
[2:10:38] brincubus: nutz_hang_uneven: "finally some one did it"
[2:10:43] dropbombsss: the backtracking lmao
[2:10:43] pharmztko: @aimed57 exactly
[2:10:43] dakamf: I do not mean verbaly
[2:10:49] Swishinn: he said "finally someone did it"
[2:10:59] Swishinn: mitch prolly stole his gf or something
[2:11:01] thinkablelol: FAFO
[2:11:04] thinkablelol: FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT
[2:11:05] dakamf: It was said he started multiple fights that day Mizkif was just one of them.
[2:11:07] nutz_hang_uneven: I said finally miz stood up for him self
[2:11:17] baconstrippers: stop while you're ahead bro
[2:11:19] Aimed57: @nutz_hang_uneven "finally someone did it" sorry
[2:11:27] brincubus: we can literally scroll up and see what you said bruh
[2:11:28] lukex20duelist: @nutz_hang_uneven "finally someone did it =/= finally miz stood up for himself"
[2:11:30] Cybernytez: i dont believe mitch put hands at all on miz, not a chance i believe that and no verbal argument justifies this punishment
[2:11:31] Swishinn: "thought on mitch jones getting his ass kicked?"
[2:11:32] mnowpsn: lolol
[2:11:32] Crawf6: he didnt even have that much damage done to him lmao
[2:11:34] Lberry3s: @nutz_hang_uneven stop feeding this cat. He might go away
[2:11:35] Swishinn: " finally some one did it"
[2:11:35] brincubus: stop lying lmao
[2:11:49] bulvar10: You can't say finally miz stood up for ginsrlf by beating up a drunk guy Lmfao
[2:11:49] pharmztko: bro is wierd af
[2:11:50] Swishinn: weird behavior bud
[2:11:52] reaperz14: "finally someone did it" lol

[2:12:13] nutz_hang_uneven: @Lberry3s i mean no
[2:12:13] Aimed57: @nutz_hang_uneven atleast own your take
[2:12:16] robertloblaw: I would guess he's like 14
[2:12:22] Cybernytez: its crazy how so many people try to defend miz actions^^
[2:12:24] nutz_hang_uneven: @Aimed57 your a mod relax
[2:12:25] Swishinn: bro expected everyone to just dogpile mitch with him and got surprised we didnt lol
[2:12:26] MaybeRespect: @Cybernytez No verbal arguement. If someone is threatening you or say your SO you would just stand there?
[2:12:27] zee_hamster: pretty out of the loop on this one, whats the story here? Confirmed Mizkif assaulted Mitch?
[2:12:54] nutz_hang_uneven: i gtg this is crazy ill see you next month with my sub lmao
[2:12:54] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:12:57] robertloblaw: @zee_hamster Mitch posted a video today about it
[2:12:58] Ey_an: mitch got issues no doubt brought on himself
[2:13:04] Kurliy: Kurliy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 91 months! almost 100 Pog
[2:13:04] dakamf: So if I get punched I can fight back if I got bullied in the process?
[2:13:04] Swishinn: he literally said " finally some one did it " after asking about if anyone saw it lol
[2:13:05] lycansong: its mitch bros...you'd have to really lower yourself to assault him over stupid shit he says
[2:13:06] Cybernytez: @MaybeRespect  cmon dude do u really think mitch life threatened miz hahah o m g man
[2:13:07] Swishinn: then back tracked
[2:13:09] ozzerlol: brainhalvez_hang_uneven wcyd
[2:13:09] Lberry3s: That’s just letting the roids overtake your emotions
[2:13:10] skarny1: even if you're getting bullied we're grown fucking adults like get in your car and leave lmao
[2:13:14] DaniyamTV: @cdewx do you ever use chain heal?
[2:13:21] infernion: I'm so surprised by the amount of people who actually think physical assault is okay if someone insulted you or said something. Obv don't know the situation but imo anything said verbally never warrants violence
[2:13:22] Kurliy: DEW
[2:13:24] wallflower819: Have you experimented with the mana tide talent? the one making HW super fast?
[2:13:26] brewtank: @cdewx why does static + totem proj only work 50% of the time?
[2:13:26] Kurliy: man wtf happened
[2:13:27] Aimed57: anywayyyy... how ab the qualifiers tomorrow LUL

[2:13:40] Cybernytez: @MaybeRespect  i fact mizs actions could have killed him from what ive seen, he literally had bruises on his neck
[2:13:40] MaybeRespect: @Cybernytez It was a question directly to your statement of "not verbal arguement". Do you actually believe that or just talkin out your a**?
[2:13:48] robertloblaw: @infernion preach
[2:13:49] Grimkrawl: talking shit is not illegal, assault is thats all i know
[2:14:07] kingtoke1991: I cant believe it took this long for mitch to get knocked out lol..
[2:14:08] Cybernytez: @MaybeRespect what are you even talking about dude
[2:14:11] Kurliy: why I always come in here and you got half a face of hair
[2:14:13] bulvar10: Mitch apparently asked for the fight lol but he was drunk as f
[2:14:16] thinkablelol: @Grimkrawl depends what it's being said, and what state they live in
[2:14:20] Cybernytez: @MaybeRespect stop talking to me if u can argue at all
[2:14:25] Cybernytez: cant*
[2:14:25] Crawf6: why are you acting like he was badly beaten
[2:14:26] kingtoke1991: Mitch has had it coming for years lets be honest
[2:14:26] Gandalf7075: it's not worth ever fighting if you can avoid it
[2:14:29] Grimkrawl: ?? no freedom of speech is a real thing lol
[2:14:31] Crawf6: he's clearly conscious after the "fightt"
[2:14:32] Gandalf7075: one punch can end it all
[2:14:40] Mrshmyt: so..... what bet did you lose?
[2:14:41] MarioTF2: Rbjs
[2:14:50] Crawf6: he had a scratch/bruise on the neck thats not even that big
[2:14:52] MaybeRespect: @Cybernytez I'm not argueing. It was a simple question. Do you actually believe what you said 100% or just in this case?
[2:14:53] Cybernytez: i need to put some miz asslickers on my ignore list now
[2:14:55] Crawf6: and small bruises on face
[2:15:11] bulvar10: Mitch shouldn't have provoked a fight from an autistic kid like miz
[2:15:15] Clarinet_Music: comment from thread lmao: Cdew is what Mitch could be if he wanted. Play wow everyday, get paid super well, hot wife , kids, and a big house. He chooses this nonsense.
[2:15:18] Crawf6: he's still screaming at miz after the "fight"
[2:15:28] brewtank: @cdewx why does static + totem proj only work 50% of the time? 󠀀
[2:15:34] dakamf: No one says it's OK to assault someone. But without full video proof believing Mitch Jones with his history is beyond me
[2:15:39] lukex20duelist: chats acting diff tonight
[2:15:41] jasonkbkt: Never really cared for mizkif, seemed like a spoiled leech
[2:15:41] brotherbonk: everyone saying they'd press charges are the fragile apes who've never been in a scuffle before
[2:15:45] Kingmidas79: its never good to get knocked out especially if you have a concussion from it.
[2:15:48] biofreaks: doesn’t matter if Mitch provoked the fight. it’s still assault.
[2:15:50] Crawf6: well hows he talking if hes unconscious
[2:15:57] infernion: @brotherbonk Being in scuffles don't make you cool KEKW
[2:16:00] dooshken: Weird that the video is hella cut
[2:16:06] Cybernytez: mitch made miz LUL without mitch miz wouldnt even be popular
[2:16:07] Athletics46: So why did this even happen?
[2:16:12] Dehungerize: mayvbe it was staged
[2:16:12] DaniyamTV: @brewtank you probably sometimes want to put the victim to far away, then it wont work, or in line of sight from the starter position
[2:16:13] dakamf: Because it would put him a in a bad light ofc
[2:16:19] pharmztko: weirdge chat
[2:16:25] Kingmidas79: concussions have lasting effects. it doesnt matter what mitch said if you cant take someone saying shit to you with out resorting to physical violence you need to work on yourself
[2:16:30] dooshken: @Cybernytez Not really
[2:16:39] conchelobe: @crawf6 I don't know the situation at all but just as a general rule of thumb people can be knocked out for as short as a few seconds
[2:16:46] MaybeRespect: I think you should definitely know when to walk away. But if someone is in your face threatening you or being violent then I would agree with a scuffle. But the video was edited so who knows
[2:16:49] baldeyx: calling an adult who behaves in parasocial fashion "autistic" is not an attack on children who are struggling with a disorder they may very well be able to overcome as they grow up
[2:16:53] Dehungerize: well... ppl do need to learn not to talk shit
[2:16:59] gracioussatan: this topic is already becoming really repetitive and boring
[2:16:59] Cybernytez: @dooshken  oh it is i remember the streams when he hosted him multiple times ^^ he bumped him up huge
[2:17:09] brotherbonk: never said it makes you cool, some things are just a consequence of life, talking shit and provoking people  might land you on your ass
[2:17:20] starskedc: What's cdew got the orc haircut
[2:17:30] igmatats: lol orc haircut
[2:18:07] lukex20duelist: lets talk about literally anything else boys
[2:18:07] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:18:09] dooshken: @Cybernytez He didn't "make" him. If he did, Miz would've faded into obscurity without him. I watched the streams back in 2018-2019, Miz was a funny guy
[2:18:28] igmatats: Excuse me barber, Ill take the "something me doing" please
[2:18:29] gracioussatan: time to make a MitchJonesFight discord boys
[2:18:34] bulvar10: I wonder what blizz could do to make mw in a better spot this Meta
[2:18:35] gracioussatan: go talk about it somewhere else pls
[2:19:09] Cybernytez: you dont understand that no matter how "good" you are at streaming, without people watching you you will not blew up easy. he helped him enourmous on that path ^^ @dooshken
[2:19:09] lukex20duelist: @bulvar10 until fw is deleted mw should be f tier
[2:19:39] bulvar10: @lukex20duelist yeeaaaah cast weaver just has so much throughput and I love the cd's it had but being unable to help with dmg sucks
[2:19:43] gracioussatan: I can only dream of FW being deleted
[2:19:58] dooshken: @Cybernytez How do I not understand that? You're just making stuff up at this point lol. Keep hating Miz blindly bro, idc. I don't even watch the guy anymore
[2:20:15] lukex20duelist: @dooshken what r ur thoughts on buffing arms warrior
[2:20:25] dooshken: @dooshken SMOrc good idea
[2:20:35] Cybernytez: @dooshken  you clearly dont understand the system bro and idc just stop talking to me thx
[2:21:40] Bingo1: dewYo
[2:22:15] FreddyFerrera: do you think rsham needs something like an ironbark to deal with burst better? @cdewx
[2:22:17] lukex20duelist: do i make ribs tonight or do i fry chicken i need assistance
[2:22:19] Kiroowow: !followage

[2:22:42] sharpex_: @lukex20duelist fry chicken
[2:22:54] conchelobe: !followage
[2:22:55] Moobot: @conchelobe conchelobe's been asking Cdew to use hex for 8y 1mo OSFrog

[2:23:15] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:23:18] jasonkbkt: Fried chicken all day
[2:23:21] pharmztko: ribs
[2:23:24] Itzmorgan22: ribs boy
[2:23:27] lukex20duelist: rsham being bad into cleaves is as guaranteed as the sun setting
[2:23:28] jasonkbkt: Some Texas pete
[2:23:32] lukex20duelist: its just the way it is
[2:23:52] brewtank: weird ok ty
[2:24:07] thatboyjem: Yo chuck how ya doin bud
[2:24:08] nikthevoker: totems feel outdated 1/2 the time
[2:24:37] EFFSIN: U see the game of jones newest episode @cdewx
[2:25:02] dooshken: What is the frost mage dmg like?
[2:25:20] bulvar10: What if blizz buffed jade crackling lightning by like 100% for mw
[2:25:27] Swishinn: would you say this is one of the most diverse metas we've had? (outside of outlaw ofc)
[2:25:47] dooshken: @bulvar10 For what purpose?
[2:25:48] retnuh15: when we shaving
[2:26:12] bulvar10: So that cast weaver can be viable
[2:26:33] dooshken: How does buffing MW dmg a bit make them more viable? They still just get trained, no?
[2:26:53] Swishinn: yeah i dont think lightning is their golden ticket
[2:26:55] bulvar10: Idk if being trained is the issue for mw (port stun etc)
[2:26:57] allentrinh: Look at that beautiful ping macro.
[2:27:15] bulvar10: Mw has great throughput, not great mana but issue Imo anyways is that they can't help do dmg at all

[2:44:09] Semis394: make it a sub goal
[2:44:10] Semis394: lol
[2:44:17] zachgamegodx: I’m curious why you started with the dh destro and if outlaw destro is at all on your radar to try

[2:44:55] Zerolol123: dh destro far more offensive than outlaw destro
[2:44:59] Zerolol123: outlaw destro just there to damp
[2:45:05] Zerolol123: and boomy rogue can already do that
[2:45:05] desowl69: If you are just shaving it off then you don't need to see it that well
[2:45:10] Semis394: DH dies sooner also
[2:45:12] zachgamegodx: yes, outlaw more damp dh destro runs folks down
[2:45:43] dooshken: do you still ike the balance druid?
[2:45:49] shockbabie: @cdewx wat did the move make changes to for the championship games or did u guys jus not play ur best
[2:47:29] Zerolol123: that's basically it. wizk flipped a switch and went off LUL
[2:47:41] zachgamegodx: the shaman on their team said in the winning interview that they were "focuising on small stuff like totem stomping" as the change
[2:47:53] Zerolol123: the game you guys won sam was at 1% for a solid 10 seconds
[2:48:13] kolorus: why is that? wink dmg?

[2:48:22] iiconiicz: My pov i thought you played the series really well. Esp mana wise and How long you were holding link
[2:48:34] iiconiicz: A few times i was shitting my self expecting the link you heald it longer
[2:48:43] Semis394: wikz damage was crazy for sure in final serires
[2:48:48] Semis394: series*
[2:48:54] Swishinn: whats your favorite flavor of ramen
[2:49:13] Zerolol123: wizk practically soloing mes in game 5 pretty much sums it up
[2:49:15] zachgamegodx: @dooshken i dont know em
[2:49:18] Jplague21: I know Wizk is good but I kinda wonder if spriest really benefitted from the buffs they got
[2:49:43] Jplague21: I struggled with playing my spriest hard before the buffs
[2:49:54] Ulby42: is this the new comp going forward? or just playing soemthing other than rogue?
[2:49:56] Zerolol123: am I crazy for thinking this is around the same time mitch "wrecked his van" @cdewx

[2:54:32] Cybernytez: mitch*
[2:54:39] Snackz39: Thoughts on Echo losing without Mehhx? Think it's juts new team adjusting or think Mehhx was just THAT good?
[2:55:00] dooshken: Video mitch posted had really suspicious cuts
[2:55:01] Zerolol123: @Snackz39 both
[2:55:40] Zerolol123: @Snackz39 but lontar will catch shit forever from the community if they don't do well this upcoming week for sure
[2:55:54] laha1n: @Snackz39 i also wonder how much of an impact playing against comps that almost nobody plays has on it
[2:56:25] Zerolol123: it shouldn't but it will be
[2:56:29] Zerolol123: even commentators said so
[2:56:37] Complezity: why not rdruid in this comp ?
[2:56:56] brincubus: does meh still play?
[2:57:14] Snackz39: Not saying it's Lontar's fault by any means, just tough spot for him.
[2:57:14] brincubus: word word
[2:57:25] hcrzealot: @brincubus Yeah, he still plays.  He was on yesterday in fact
[2:57:28] laha1n: could this comp slow the game down enough for rdruid to drink? @cdewx
[2:57:58] brincubus: @hcrzealot word, thanks

[2:58:43] umo3: lontar played decent on druid and insane on sham
[2:58:47] Thunder4o: Problem for Echo comes with that Lontar is really good on Rsham,but Rsham is not good in current meta and against all the cleave teams on EU
[2:58:49] Qdubbz: REMATCH
[2:58:56] Cybernytez: people said today AWC was fun to watch and whaazz couldnt believe that people like this he thinsk wow is in the worst state in pvp ever... thoughts ? XD
[2:59:20] sharpex_: Raiku had 180+ms cause of Server issues and they faced a ww rogue that legit no one plays
[2:59:23] brincubus: worst place ever? how?
[2:59:32] brincubus: the games were fun af to watch
[2:59:47] brincubus: maybe thats purely from a player standpoint
[2:59:51] dooshken: EU AWC games were great
[3:00:00] dooshken: NA less so cause of all the outlaw but that's just imo
[3:00:00] Cybernytez: yeah thats what people think but whaazz thinks pvp itself is in the worst state xd
[3:00:13] entropysargeras: oh noes rog not 100% OP? pvp must be in a bad state.
[3:00:17] brincubus: i'm curious to hear why he thinks thaty
[3:00:21] Cybernytez: he said CC doesnt matter and its just PvE them down
[3:00:28] brincubus: ah
[3:00:30] Thunder4o: if he really thinks that,then he is really bias because his precious RMP isnt broken for once
[3:00:35] laha1n: @entropysargeras i know you not saying it but rogue is 100% op
[3:00:54] Immortal1266: which spells can heal through shadowy duel?
[3:01:04] Cybernytez: idk if Cc doesnt matter when peole literalyl can die in a global ^^
[3:01:20] entropysargeras: rog is more balanced now than it has been in a long time. I love being SD on my fury.
[3:01:28] Thunder4o: He plays outlaw and says cc doesnt matter...
[3:01:42] Thunder4o: while he keep in cc some1 for over 15 sec alone
[3:02:01] Cybernytez: yeah thats what im saying
[3:02:07] sharpex_: He said if a ww runs into you trinkets the opener and walls and still can cant die that is not okay
[3:02:09] Cybernytez: im not on the same page there
[3:02:38] Thunder4o: @sharpex_ he was doing exactly that when RMP was broken
[3:02:41] Cybernytez: i actually have fun in PvP right now ngl
[3:02:42] Zerolol123: whaaz
[3:02:49] brincubus: whazz

[3:04:50] SwiisH_Tv: @mavy123456 why you so mad?
[3:04:54] laha1n: i think NA awc was way more entertaining until ww/rogue games but i like dumb zug and close games
[3:04:54] Thunder4o: like i said,he is used to RMP being beyond broken,so he can use everything offensive and still dont get punished,now some1 else is doing this thing to him and for first time he feels what it is to others when they were faceing RMP
[3:04:56] Tyferious: Is this on PTR?

[4:16:44] tommymage: think every outlaw hates playing orc
[4:16:48] tommymage: and they think its bad compared to nelf
[4:16:51] gshenks: rogue way harder to kill than dh imo
[4:16:55] WagwanBombaClatBomba: i think u have to be night elf playing outlaw
[4:17:03] Aro725: i think DH dies in stuns. But if the DH can attack it never dies with so much leech and fel dev heals
[4:17:14] deadmozart: what happened to your hair?
[4:17:14] gambleragain: @dirtboyyyyy i might be outdated, but i think it heals more the lower the taret is
[4:17:16] deadmozart: lol
[4:17:22] gshenks: rogue also shits on dh in general
[4:17:32] dirtboyyyyy: What does shaman mastery do?
[4:17:40] nikthevoker: extra stealth for outlaw is big
[4:17:49] WagwanBombaClatBomba: whaazz played orc outlaw against the holigaans, and he said hes never playing orc outlaw again ever
[4:18:37] dirtboyyyyy: So your healing stream follows that?
[4:18:44] Bierinfusion: you heal someone at fulllife for 100%, if you would heal someone on 1 hp, dew would heal them for 140%

[4:18:44] bignoooodle: so the opposite of evoker
[4:18:45] TommyTribal: is it most efficient to wait until your target is low before healing them, or does it not matter much?
[4:18:52] Ameratzu: thats allows you to sit long cc chains
[4:18:58] deadmozart: what happened to your hair?
[4:19:02] brincubus: wow 2.0 is gonna call "deep Healing "Clutch Healzz" to bring in more zoomers

[4:21:36] brincubus: outlaw mastery is pretty awful  iirc
[4:21:41] hiueeee: this sp is isn't wizzling enough
[4:21:54] zachgamegodx: your attacks have a static 30% chance to trigger an attack that does 15k base and scales with mastery
[4:22:36] bignoooodle: that sounds OP af but i can see how that might be dog in pvp
[4:22:37] realxcg: trinket link staying strong
[4:22:50] zachgamegodx: stinks everywhere

[7:19:30] Itankarenas: ah rip
[7:19:32] Linruat: did we ever get addressed the mult snipe of link?
[7:19:56] Onca4242: I blame the production for making that a thing
[7:19:59] iggy_pls: Wiz was just expecting link and was ready for it no addressing needed
[7:20:02] Onca4242: And now it's gonna stick around for ages lol
[7:20:11] iggy_pls: The casters took it too far for sure
[7:20:13] Itankarenas: honestly, i'd be surprised if he didn't have a /tar link totem "spellname" macro
[7:20:20] Itankarenas: for just killing it
[7:20:25] Linruat: those macros don't work
[7:20:26] iggy_pls: You can't target totems with macros so that's invalid
[7:20:31] Itankarenas: oh really?
[7:20:36] Itankarenas: damn, he was quick af then
[7:21:00] chrye_xx: wiz said what he did in stream, pretty sure he said it was a mouse over
[7:21:21] sanatalive: lol
[7:21:24] sanatalive: nop way that was a mouseover
[7:21:32] sanatalive: you can target them with wa and a macro
[7:21:36] chrye_xx: then what was it..
[7:21:41] chrye_xx: macro don’t work on totems
[7:21:54] Itankarenas: you could do it with a mouseover if you know where it's gonna spawn
[7:21:55] iggy_pls: The wa just makes them easier to target, you can't macro target totems
[7:21:57] sanatalive: ya it does, its like the macro that cancels treants on resto druid
[7:22:21] chrye_xx: how in any way is that similar lol
[7:22:33] iggy_pls: I'm just gonna stop answering cause everyday it's the same argument lmao
[7:22:38] sanatalive: causet hte treants are like totems in the game code

[7:23:07] dipicat: i dont like it either dew
[7:23:09] Linruat: sorry. didn't mean to bring up totem drama, lol
[7:23:28] Itankarenas: I actually hate going against hunters as lock. They just line the fuck out of me if I try to go on them and pump my ass if I dont
[7:23:31] DayDrinkin: @cdewx playing high rating ladder games are they fairly easy compared to awc games overall.
[7:23:52] Vetias: Hey cdew, do you know which of your previous broadcasts has some prevoker gameplay? I'd love to watch and learn some of your plays.
[7:23:56] sum_x: macros dont work on enemy totems though
[7:24:12] iggy_pls: Only thing you lose in ladder is eating
[7:24:13] chrye_xx: @sum_x that’s what I’m trying to say lol
[7:24:17] iggy_pls: Rating*
[7:24:52] DayDrinkin: ya I see what your saying.
[7:24:58] celipra86: Is there tourney tomorrow awc as well or a different tournament?
[7:25:00] iggy_pls: Wiz just the best sp in the game next topic
[7:25:03] celipra86: The*
[7:25:08] WutFace_VS_KrippO: i have never seen it dying before not even ticking tho ngl
[7:25:13] Cybernytez: KEKW
[7:25:22] iggy_pls: Reckful bombed a totem once
[7:25:22] iLLwiLL_HS: dude my first ever game of arena i swear i was having a heart attack my veins were huge and i was sweating
[7:25:23] thinkablelol: nah best sp is pikaboo
[7:25:40] Linruat: i was with supa, i thought it was accidentally on top of a pillar he was so fast
[7:25:46] rwrbrickzy: wtf did u do to ur hair
[7:25:51] rwrbrickzy: the dew has changed
[7:25:59] yesayax: the reason the wizk link kill looked sus is because the awc ui doesnt show nameplates. If you look the totem animation coming from ground delay vs the nameplate which is instant.
[7:26:26] RealXrave: @yesayax thats what ive been trying to explain, ty!!!
[7:26:31] RealXrave: wiz just a legend
[7:27:06] Cybernytez: ya i mean he killed it 1 time insta, he expected the link as well so he was already waiting for it
[7:27:08] celipra86: Do you guys know who you're facing tomorrow yet or have to wait ?
[7:27:13] Ssolemn: Wiz is making spriest look good, I feel like that's more impressive than sniping a totem lol
[7:27:16] Linruat: I like it when both spriest and aff can do relevant damage. I love splay
[7:27:21] RealXrave: it was trinket link or die and he knew it
[7:27:36] coachingpotatoes: holy ppl still going full steam about the totem?
[7:27:39] RealXrave: all though sam lived LuL
[7:27:57] Linruat: @coachingpotatoes nah. i just watched the games yesterday and asked about it. didn't realize i was stirring shit up

[7:29:15] deathmodeWOW: Do I need precog on resto sham?
[7:29:18] AshyxQC: Wait your male pattern balding has increased very quickly. What happened Chuck?
[7:29:34] RealXrave: omg u killed that healing stream so fast Kappa
[7:29:42] Itankarenas: @deathmodeWOW would be insane to not have precog as a healer
[7:30:13] celipra86: Damn. Destro looking fun af again
[7:30:14] DayDrinkin: @cdewx I guess the basis for my question was. your playing lock. would you feel confident in an AWC game playing lock and your other teammates swapping when ur not the healer.
[7:30:29] DayDrinkin: because ur playing it at a high level
[7:30:37] deathmodeWOW: @itankarenas I think cdew precog and Longar dont use it
[7:32:27] RealXrave: 5k IQ
[7:32:50] Itankarenas: @deathmodeWOW for high levels 3s where everyone knows their shit maybe, but shuffle, no way imo

[7:35:49] isseswagger: or something
[7:35:55] Itankarenas: @deathmodeWOW most rshams in top 50 are running it in ladder, and even more in shuffle according to murlokio data
[7:36:13] RealXrave: def big brain tech for ps to cycle back
[7:36:17] RealXrave: MiniK

[7:37:20] DayDrinkin: that would be so sick though. like seeing a last match y’all are up and you Que up the lock lol. I guess there is too much on the line. but still.
[7:37:23] Itankarenas: 7k vers is bis on destro
[7:37:31] Aro725: wiz had like 45 percent haste lol
[7:37:38] beastboyy122: don’t vers DR after 30%
[7:37:44] beastboyy122: @cdewx
[7:37:46] RealXrave: need some BFA corruptions to get 7k vers
[7:37:48] Davrockx: @beastboyy122 depends on class
[7:37:49] Itankarenas: like 33 I think
[7:37:52] chrisiirc: feels like i should be maxxing my vers on feral lol
