[6:23:08] Kenndoo: You said it fine. You've just pulled the exact same Kasper ~5 times
[6:23:26] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD tell me about it lol
[6:23:38] ItsDays: the population count cards have a population count 1 theres a 1000 500 variant etc
[6:23:44] ItsDays: but theres multiple 1s its odd
[6:23:48] force_FMD: like he is awful wulf lol

[6:24:35] OnceAMoose: It is. I have the 100 and only 100 made
[6:24:38] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD dude i played defense when i played hockey and he breaks every rule ever taught to dmen growing up and he gets 10 mill
[6:24:42] Bugknight24: its for 1000 points right?
[6:24:42] Kneckt: $7 on ebay
[6:24:50] ItsDays: as someone who collects strictly hockey it is one of the weird inserts of the hobby
[6:24:51] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD edmonton still too much about offense IMO
[6:24:58] FruckAwesome: @Kneckt how many days left
[6:25:01] itjustfeelsright: he still needs like 250 points for 1000 career points
[6:25:06] FruckAwesome: all ebay happens in the last 10min
[6:25:07] kdoggboi415: heh I'll buy that for $7
[6:25:09] force_FMD: @Wulfgrym yeah its a shame
[6:25:11] ItsDays: zach benson ill take LMAO
[6:25:23] ItsDays: bedard is just a hit and dump
[6:25:24] i_beebo: Bedard inc
[6:25:34] ItsDays: pulled one out of another product he was first in sold it for 300$
[6:25:40] FruckAwesome: yea Im gonna wait for the hard crash after this and get one hehe
[6:25:58] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD last year the knights did a great job on shutting teams down and won the cup, we need that type of effort or its never going to happen

[6:26:21] Tweek1987: Nick suzuki was golfing at all star game in vegas . It was a " game " they made
[6:26:31] ItsDays: ive seen some real dumb cases of this like 4 bedards is the most ive seen I think
[6:26:41] kdoggboi415: Sadge
[6:26:55] JumpTroopC5: Clap
[6:27:05] ItsDays: the biggest problem is, the S1 was 125$ a box now this is 300$ a box
[6:27:06] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD i got a differing opinion on mcdavid but i understand that perspective
[6:27:11] ItsDays: as a hockey collector it really sucks
[6:27:13] OnceAMoose: Case of Tins
[6:27:27] ItsDays: case of tins goes INSANE ive seeen allot of bedards pop from those
[6:27:40] ItsDays: the CC is case hit so thats good
[6:27:45] ItsDays: levi canvas also decent
[6:27:46] force_FMD: @Wulfgrym what about whinny draisital now :D

[6:28:12] LegoCoin: Population Count I think means 1 of 1000 for the 1000
[6:28:14] HeavenlyDarkling: carter hart lol
[6:28:14] ItsDays: zach benson, logan cooley. tye kartye obviously bedard
[6:28:17] LegoCoin: can anyone confirm
[6:28:27] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD i don't know i haven't follwed the season much, i never do, season hockey doesn't interest me anymore

[6:28:36] force_FMD: @Wulfgrym without hyman this year i dont know where the oilers would be
[6:28:41] ItsDays: 6-8 per box I believe
[6:28:59] ItsDays: the logan cooley canvas if you pulled that is a really nice hit
[6:29:14] LegoCoin: yep Population count of 1000 means only 1k cards made
[6:29:20] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD i mcdavid might hit the assist record, personally i like that someone other than mcdavid and draistahl are scoring,
[6:29:24] Kneckt: 6.75
[6:29:25] Flolade: 6.75
[6:29:27] VarlBGem: just under 7
[6:29:37] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD every year, those 2 do the heavy lifting and it does jack
[6:29:38] ItsDays: very surprised only one bedard
[6:29:46] ItsDays: been seeing on average 2 Bedards YG
[6:29:53] LegoCoin: 7/153 I think
[6:29:53] force_FMD: oh yeah wulf, i actually like kane this yr
[6:30:05] ItsDays: the highlighters are good
[6:30:13] ItsDays: theres a rarity to the highlighters
[6:30:16] Tweek1987: Jack allen traded yesterday.
[6:30:16] ItsDays: just dont know it off the top of my head
[6:30:18] force_FMD: but lets be honest i think within the next 5 yrs mcdavid will be a maple leaf
[6:30:33] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD i like the team from whati  have seen overall with a few exceptions but we will see what happens in playoffs
[6:30:35] ItsDays: credentials is such a weird set
[6:30:49] ItsDays: day with the cup is super sought after
[6:30:57] force_FMD: @Wulfgrym what do you think, i think mcdavid becomes a maple leaf
[6:31:01] force_FMD: growing up in ontario
[6:31:09] ItsDays: people love them
[6:31:12] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD i hope not, maple leafs, no thanks
[6:31:17] ItsDays: that YG /100 will sell fast
[6:31:27] Griffin977: what’s the stupidest thing you’d do for a million cash
[6:31:27] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD up to him
[6:31:39] ItsDays: logan cooley canvas and levi canvas are really good
[6:31:50] LegoCoin: cjayGASM
[6:32:07] ItsDays: the bedard YG went down to 600$ and back up to above 1k its so wild
[6:32:10] TheeCableguy: lol $5 for all the new york rangers :P
[6:32:23] Flolade: Confirmed: Case openings every week
[6:32:30] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD personally if he doesn't get it done by then, i hope he goes somewhere to get it done, hes too good to be limited by the dysfunction of edmonton. Im a blackhawks fan as well because of all the bullshit gone on since the gretzky trade going forward so my loyalties are split
[6:32:38] ItsDays: @Towelliee the highlighters have a rarity to em which makes em unique
[6:32:44] ItsDays: different colors are rarer I guess
[6:32:58] force_FMD: @Wulfgrym 100% agree with that
[6:33:07] ItsDays: just sucks the price tag on this Series 2 is so much higher than series 1
[6:33:24] ItsDays: I strictly do hockey and this release is so out of reach
[6:33:25] force_FMD: its like the blue jays they can't make a winning team but their talents go to waste
[6:33:34] ItsDays: I can buy a better product with guaranteed autos for half the price
[6:33:57] ItsDays: itll go way down too
[6:34:12] Wulfgrym: @force_FMD its two fold, its canada/edmonton (stupid cold) and hyper hockey town. So most guys awnt to go to the states and live anon
[6:34:18] ItsDays: id go sp authentic with the true future watch rookie autos
[6:34:24] ItsDays: thats 2 boxes of that for the price of one S2
[6:34:36] ItsDays: dude the bedard shot down to 600$ right back up to 1k$ makes no sense
[6:35:00] ItsDays: wonder what the /25 bedards gonna sell for
[6:35:25] force_FMD: @Wulfgrym and our taxes and dollar hurt players
[6:35:33] ItsDays: I think people are getting it back from breakers too, so they get it in the mail instant sell when they get it
[6:35:34] OnceAMoose: Ebay is throttling posts to keep the prices high
[6:36:11] ItsDays: outburst bedard sold at 2k today
[6:36:15] OnceAMoose: It took over 24 hours for my Outburst to get listed to be visible public
