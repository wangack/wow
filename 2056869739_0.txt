[0:06:06] Ambersulfr: everyone copes on their main spec
[0:06:08] hutchyy917: why would any person admit their main is OP
[0:06:25] Sosatko: I don’t see the point like I main resto Druid and it’s very strong lmfao
[0:06:28] atarri1: are there games today or is the next time they pay saturday
[0:06:45] kusoneko: spec = good, and rating = low, means they = bad
[0:06:45] hutchyy917: except mage mains. l
[0:06:54] b_lappy: because they should be doing better with it if it's overtuned Kappa
[0:07:08] Sosatko: every shaman main cries yet it wins awc
[0:07:10] Sosatko: prettt funny
[0:07:23] Ambersulfr: shaman is buggy and it gets annoying if you play it a lot

[0:24:27] marvin1995xo: its good
[0:24:27] itsvoltzyt: try outlaw its wild
[0:24:27] pharmztko: ass be ass
[0:24:27] nightmxz: Assa is insane, it just dies unliike the other 2
[0:24:28] Mrshmyt: outlaw or bust
[0:24:29] xoHOLLOW: i think they mean the abbreviation of assassination is ass
[0:24:30] Telarius1: its big dam in 2s
[0:24:31] heymomimonttv: like no question at all, assa is worst rogue spec
[0:24:33] nikthevoker: everytime i have an assa iun the lobby its horrible
[0:24:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think it's that bad, it's just more of a PvE spec
[0:24:37] legiontheworgen: Assassination's very... hit or miss in my experience if i'm honest
[0:24:37] Guettalx: thats what pika keeps saying i thinmk they are repeating
[0:24:40] nikthevoker: they go at most 2-4
[0:24:42] Deyconn: its def viable
[0:24:53] ImShmoly: its not trash, a little squish but big dam
[0:24:55] kreyzy8: compared to outlaw it sucks
[0:24:55] Darko_sKiLLz: prob better in 2s
[0:24:58] Sosatko: Well for rogue, if it isnt S+++ its unplayable
[0:24:59] Garthd: Great job with the commentary, you're the mvp
[0:25:04] Hevoftw: i love a thing or two Pog
[0:25:08] Totesmag0tes: get em

[0:25:16] taruninja88: cant teach me im 1500 in ss
[0:25:19] xtodt: CTRL + F12
[0:25:46] Phreshbrew: didnt an assass rogue kill the mies?  can't be that bad if it took down the greatest holy paladin of all time
[0:25:49] Guettalx: @xtodt the alien bind
[0:25:56] zachgamegodx: should play night elf tho, maybe we do a fund raiser
[0:26:01] zachgamegodx: its like play 0.75 assa
[0:26:03] Deyconn: i think 2 set is the paly
[0:26:07] ImShmoly: yes
[0:26:10] legiontheworgen: 2 yes, 4 not so much
[0:26:16] Lugges48: its not that bad... with the aoe build ur top dmg in a full melee lobby even with dh in it
[0:26:48] zachgamegodx: it's 2 set or nothing ven
[0:27:02] brewtank: @venruki is it the time of the year where we get the annual tohsyendik gameplay?
[0:27:02] zachgamegodx: 2sets slightly more dmg, no 2 set is like 6 or 7% more vers
[0:27:19] Darko_sKiLLz: lol
[0:27:33] smoochins: @SwiisH_Tv yeah he has
[0:27:47] Lugges48: that is single target build
[0:27:48] nightmxz: Assa rogue with dance Kreygasm you can silence anyone anytime
[0:27:49] nikthevoker: you just dot everyone, then fulll send
[0:27:52] Lugges48: u also want the aoe build
[0:28:04] Lugges48: aoe build is alot better in melee lobbys
[0:28:22] Lugges48: the no. 1 shuffle assa in eu has the aoe build
[0:28:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's still a rogue, you got tools
[0:28:38] Lugges48: no aoe dmg build not blind...
[0:29:07] Ambersulfr: if you can do rsham you can do rogue
[0:29:12] zachgamegodx: copy https://drustvar.com/leaderboard/solo/rogue/assassination?region=eu&sortby=rank myk, hes private but he's the genius on assa
[0:29:17] Mrshmyt: I start doing shift mouse buttons
[0:29:24] AnguishTM: there's classes with more xd
[0:29:26] Mrshmyt: Unless you dont have mouse buttons
[0:29:34] LucidFox9: there are multiple abilities you can macro together because you always use them together
[0:29:38] AnguishTM: if u can do those, u'll be able to do rogue
[0:29:53] leeka: hidden
[0:30:17] BeardedSl0th: @venruki just wanted to say the happiest I've ever seen mies is when he's watching your reaction to his games. Just wanted to say thanks and in the mies stream we are all pro ruki.
[0:30:27] LucidFox9: there are 3 builds, single target, mix, and aoe
[0:30:29] nightmxz: AoE build vs single target build lol
[0:30:37] sixthycent: dude trollillng no kingsbane
[0:30:40] Darko_sKiLLz: no king no echoing
[0:30:48] Darko_sKiLLz: interesting
[0:30:50] AndroniusMaximus: Oh no chat is confusing him
[0:30:50] LucidFox9: I personally like single target but im a pleb
[0:30:50] nightmxz: King's bane is nuts
[0:30:51] sixthycent: kingsbane is nice a burst in between deathmark
[0:30:52] famous1939: that aoe build is not likely his normal one
[0:30:55] kreyzy8: depends what you're playing vs
[0:31:01] Robinhooez: AOE build is PVE
[0:31:03] TootinFresh: Play aoe bleed with an aff lock
[0:31:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mix sounds good to me, probably break a few less sheep
[0:31:07] nightmxz: You can get 300k kingsbanes lol
[0:31:19] marvin1995xo: shadow dance one
[0:31:34] AnguishTM: try < / > key

[0:32:15] Deyconn: who doesnt like booty though
[0:32:20] nameyourform: WHAZZ IS ON ASK THE MAN
[0:32:21] anmusallam: Good morning venman
[0:32:25] AnguishTM: echoing goes hard if uk what ure doing
[0:32:41] anmusallam: How are you :)
[0:32:55] TootinFresh: Copy whaaz ez
[0:32:57] haendicap: Why would you ask third place? Kappa
[0:33:11] sbrees: Echoing reprimand does not work with assa
[0:33:21] AnguishTM: you got a 70% kb?
[0:33:24] marvin1995xo: why have sap on one ?
[0:33:32] Deyconn: wanna queue it up?
[0:33:36] AnguishTM: it works with all specs, tf
[0:33:41] maenkins: echoing is legit the only way you can go brrrrrr
[0:33:42] Lugges48: echo is old tech
[0:33:47] sbrees: cold blood better than echoing
[0:34:02] maenkins: false
[0:34:04] b_lappy: no
[0:34:09] CoAco95: I like cold blood with kingsbane yea
[0:34:19] legiontheworgen: imho echoing for consistency cause only way to get 7-point ruptures, cold blood's great for burst.
[0:34:22] haendicap: Ven as a 1200 rogue in chat, I suggest you listen to my conflicting opinion
[0:34:23] Lugges48: most ppl dont play echo neither coldblood
[0:34:25] smoochins: twitch chat is 3600 xp
[0:34:25] Grimadin: 1300
[0:34:27] sbrees: bind cold blood with kingsbane
[0:34:29] LucidFox9: you want most of your power into kingsbane
[0:34:30] ungodlyxdx: I main assass rogue on SOD
[0:34:31] heymomimonttv: instead of listening to chat, just look for the pro assa rogues out there
[0:34:34] heymomimonttv: oh wait, theres no atm lol
[0:34:35] sarent02: why u make it so complicated just look up the nr assa in shuffel
[0:34:35] LucidFox9: so the build is to stack everything you can into it
[0:34:36] Infidel_Tech: you’re projecting theres no way to communicate authority via text
[0:34:38] zachgamegodx: both are not played, cold blood is not worth taking because of master assassin plus you have like 20% crit baseline so your chance to crit from dance is already 50% ...
[0:34:40] sppttv: 10x r1 twitch viewer
[0:34:43] b_lappy: you get 30% increased crit while stealthed/shadow dance is active
[0:34:44] Lugges48: u want tea for mastery
[0:34:45] AnguishTM: SKILLCAPPED
[0:34:46] thelakeshark: you have so much crit in dance with MA CB isnt really worth it in my opinion.
[0:34:47] K3tchup_33: how does cold blood/kingsbane interact? do all of the ticks crit?
[0:34:51] Darko_sKiLLz: 0 xp but i qued SS one time and got 6-0
[0:34:54] b_lappy: kingsbane already crits 60-70% of the time
[0:35:04] Lugges48: u want tea and dance
[0:35:05] pmakewow: AWC HYPE AWC HYPE
[0:35:12] ImVigdis: @venruki  you have shiv on 3 different binds and distract on 2 different?
[0:35:14] heymomimonttv: ask top rogues!
[0:35:15] leeka: I wish t hey had a pvp sandbox to practice keybinds and shit
[0:35:18] braindeadjoseki: whaazz
[0:35:19] chubmax: I spent a day healing yesterday and now i understand while ss is dead
[0:35:33] Phreshbrew: just open the spellbook and click it.  assert dominance
[0:35:38] Reuhn: do u have shift mousewheels?
[0:35:46] heymomimonttv: @chubmax its the most popular pvp mode so def not dead lol
[0:35:48] Guettalx: now im thinking, do these cracked rogues bind 3 cheap, kidneyu, sap, kick and blind?
[0:35:54] zachgamegodx: this is from my conversations with lord Myk
[0:35:59] chubmax: @heymomimonttv its 40m queues at 2.2 bro, lmao  for dps
[0:36:08] chubmax: pvp is p dead in general
[0:36:09] zachgamegodx: no
[0:36:10] Lugges48: no
[0:36:14] FateIRL: nooo
[0:36:15] CoAco95: no
[0:36:21] Grimadin: that's a pve thing only
[0:36:22] sbrees: just cold blood with kingsbane maybe
[0:36:23] Lugges48: but u want to bane in dance
[0:36:35] DaraxBarex: @chubmax damn that queue time is h0rrible lol
[0:36:39] LucidFox9: the entire point of the single target build is to stack everything you can into kingsbane
[0:36:52] chubmax: ye it sucks, its why i healed
[0:37:02] zachgamegodx: ill let u digest everything and stop
[0:37:02] chubmax: id rather wait in q
[0:37:06] zachgamegodx: sorry
[0:37:07] Deyconn: lmao
[0:37:07] Darko_sKiLLz: gg
[0:37:13] kazz_ret: damn spicy food gets my nose running but its so good
[0:37:18] Doughkins: fun while it lasted
[0:37:18] heymomimonttv: im ok with that tbh rogue gameplay is not so fun to watch
[0:37:33] Grimm303: thats not true
[0:37:35] Bourbons86: rogue gameplay is the best to watch tbh
[0:37:43] AndroniusMaximus: I was looking forward to Rukirogue
[0:37:44] Sosatko: I wanna see Ven make the unplayable class gain rating
[0:37:46] Sosatko: against all odds
[0:37:51] Diddly_dope: love some tooshindik
[0:37:55] thelakeshark: have so much fun watching healers pov after dpsing for so long and watching dps streams
[0:37:57] TaurusBerserk: is ther gonna be a lfg channel in ur discord
[0:38:00] Lugges48: you want 100% thistle tea and dance - no echo, no cold blood. u want both to boost kingsbane and u want thistle tea 100% because u play 0% haste
[0:38:03] kwingas: idk watching pika play rogue is pretty entertaining
[0:38:06] internetuser97: i do :)
[0:38:24] heymomimonttv: @kwingas thats just cuz pika is entertaining, he makes every class fun to watch
[0:38:24] zachgamegodx: @camrencyber he's digesting brother
[0:38:30] SweatyDaniels: finally , the toss has come back to Val Drakken
[0:38:34] Bourbons86: can anyone remind me how to transfer UI between toons?
[0:38:39] heymomimonttv: not saying ven not entertaining to watch tho cuz im always here lol
[0:38:42] thelakeshark: no point to macro burst as assa
[0:38:57] maenkins: SD/Vanish will be good for silence cc
[0:38:58] LucidFox9: You dont do much dam outside of kingsbane though, so you dont really use shadowdance unless you have a kingsbane go
[0:39:04] nightmxz: @Bourbons86 edit mode profiles
[0:39:11] zachgamegodx: ven nobody plays coldblood, auto disregard that comment. you have 30% crit whenever you're in stealth bc of master assassin talent (look it up in the talent tree) that's why cold blood is considered useless
[0:39:12] sbrees: Or just give up on assa and embrace outlaw
[0:39:23] Bourbons86: @nightmxz thx
[0:39:27] Lugges48: sometimes u want to dance cs or garrote first tho the macro is for plebs
[0:39:52] SweatyDaniels: The Move was looking absolutely smacktacular yesterday
[0:39:53] Lugges48: u are playing 0% haste u want  thistle tea and dance
[0:39:57] Shinigamiittv: just put it on your death from above lmao that’s a dead talent, even for the niche gap closer ur prob better off just cleaving something else
[0:39:59] trashukkonen: why you have 2 shiv
[0:40:00] zachgamegodx: just look at the talent and youll see why, your talents make bane crit over 50% of the time
[0:40:00] SweatyDaniels: stergeMove stergeMove
[0:40:12] Secretwombatbro: lets just reinvent the end of sl build
[0:40:15] Secretwombatbro: just go 4p
[0:40:26] Secretwombatbro: 4 poison
[0:40:47] Secretwombatbro: get that mind numbing back in play
[0:40:53] Secretwombatbro: see if the shiv is broken agian
[0:40:55] Grimm303: getting mind numbing + atrophic is lot of dr

[0:41:13] Deyconn: you
[0:41:15] FateIRL: unspent dragon glyphs
[0:41:15] maenkins: shiv = bleed/poison dam
[0:41:26] zachgamegodx: swap mind numbing to deadened nerves
[0:41:26] Diddly_dope: will u spend dragon glyphs lol
[0:41:48] Diddly_dope: ty
[0:42:01] zachgamegodx: it's not s1 anymore, you can only use 1 non-lethal poisona nd its always gonna be crippling
[0:42:03] DirteeG: fresh rogue oh shit
[0:42:05] Secretwombatbro: something used to duplicate the mind numbing right
[0:42:33] kusoneko: press buttons
[0:42:35] zachgamegodx: @Secretwombatbro he cant use Mind numbing bc he's not dragon tempered blades or whatever quad poison spec is
[0:42:43] zachgamegodx: bc inevitable demise / aerial precision is too good
[0:42:54] smoochins: damage is outta control
[0:42:57] Secretwombatbro: oh i know im just talking about the old build to add to build confusion :p
[0:43:05] zachgamegodx: ye deathmark does that
[0:43:09] Secretwombatbro: 4 poison was so annoying lol
[0:43:13] heymomimonttv: 90k single target is big dmg? :O
[0:43:14] smoochins: big dam
[0:43:19] Lugges48: u want to dance tea shiv bane always
[0:43:24] maenkins: more poison application with KB on = more damage
[0:43:26] yeahdoggyyy: @heymomimonttv nah
[0:43:27] zachgamegodx: good utility, but ye nothing dies without inevitable demise @Secretwombatbro

[0:45:45] malvarcla: @Lord_Double idk
[0:45:52] Veyronn_00: @lu_nuu yes
[0:46:00] Kakaoolars: if you're playing increased poison damage talent instead of improved wound poison, aren't you supposed to use deadly poison then?

[1:01:17] zachgamegodx: blind gouge is usually your cc combo as assa, tough to shuv kidney on heals since u only have 1 stun without dance van
[1:01:20] Deyconn: @absterge stop
[1:01:25] Veyronn_00: id wait til tomorrow if you do tbh

[1:03:13] azliaris1: excellent design
[1:03:22] malvarcla: you need to be a smoke god like stergy
[1:03:53] everybodylikesto: @venruki Can you show your talents?
[1:04:08] skytz0: skytz0 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! rukiLove
[1:04:26] primejusticegaming: or they love fun
[1:04:34] baxter5569: supa was raging at assa rogue.
[1:04:42] Blitzylive: what's the punch monk doing?
[1:04:44] azliaris1: they love fun ( in m+ )
[1:04:46] thickwide: i do like those new feyline animations though those are cool
[1:04:48] Blitzylive: he doing same dmg as priest
[1:04:50] baxter5569: doing no dmg in some lobbies and switched to lock mid lobby
[1:05:20] jayyArrington: venruki on rogueeeee :O
[1:05:21] timmah25: just dot and drag everything
[1:06:14] trashukkonen: you are undead btw
[1:06:17] buffevoker: Did 370k kingsbane today felt good
[1:06:22] Blitzylive: did they remove the undead racial to get out of fear?
[1:06:22] azliaris1: the other team is perma full hp lol
[1:06:27] azliaris1: what is this game
[1:06:38] nameyourform: disarm!!!
[1:06:41] nameyourform: the felguard!!!
[1:06:42] nameyourform: lol
[1:06:48] buffevoker: @camrencyber Echoing
[1:06:57] Morodox: super exhilarating gameplay
[1:07:22] azliaris1: tbf i would think that kinda design is really fun in pve
[1:07:33] Darnias: why do you look like an npc
[1:07:34] AndroniusMaximus: the mog is money bro
[1:07:49] Grimm303: here it comes
[1:07:59] CosiManHimself: I don't understand the hate towards punchmonks, is it because they heal way too much, or is it because they are way too easy to use?
[1:07:59] mayonaes: oh snap an undead rogue
[1:08:01] Deyconn: mage tower set?
[1:08:01] buffevoker: @camrencyber Yeah i have never played cold boold this season maybe should try it
[1:08:10] artagore: The mog is cool tbh
[1:08:19] Rakitotv: backpackj was dope dont change the mog
[1:08:37] klocksmith: hpal counter punch monk
[1:08:38] ralvich: can’t go wrong with T2 or T4
[1:08:50] b_lappy: you can disarm and stun and garrote silence that's about it
[1:08:52] alarakthedarkener: what to you say is the best class to climb rating in Ss right now? I feel like DK got a bit squishy
[1:08:55] FateIRL: why isnt it used in awc by many teams?
[1:09:01] klocksmith: searing glare
[1:09:06] klocksmith: cant heal
[1:09:16] Diddly_dope: is noggenfogger in retail
[1:09:16] Roundhere_: he can just dispel it
[1:09:18] anmusallam: @alarakthedarkener kite like your life depends on it
[1:09:20] ooPickleRicKoo: you need a lot of cc to deal with punch monk
[1:09:21] reaperz14: Crusader's games yesterday were actually pretty fun to watch
[1:09:32] ooPickleRicKoo: if anything resto shaman counters it
[1:09:57] What_ln_Tarnation: high iq hunter
[1:09:59] alarakthedarkener: @anmusallam kiting as a dk is kinda difficult ngl
[1:10:12] anmusallam: i know, gotta chains
[1:10:25] absterge: it’s not just punch monk, it’s lunch combined with classes that enable them right? “just cc them” ret war can help them avoid cc. “just kill them” ret war can keep them alive
[1:10:36] alarakthedarkener: chains don’t really help when they’re in range of you
[1:10:51] alarakthedarkener: or if they’re a caster/hunt
[1:10:58] zomnipotent: as someone who hasnt played retail since wod, this game looks really confusing now
[1:11:32] anmusallam: @alarakthedarkener highest chain uptime, and deaths advance/ wraith if you wanna run
[1:11:34] mayonaes: Think its confusing now wait until they add hero talents
[1:11:34] nightmxz: @absterge you don't get it just cc them man
[1:11:35] GamerKrown: Ret/war or Ret/dh. but definitely  more so ret/war
[1:11:37] alarakthedarkener: which class do you recommend for cloning in SS right now?
[1:11:53] zomnipotent: not doin the sod thing venruki? join zeegs guild with us :)
[1:11:56] alarakthedarkener: climbing
[1:11:57] What_ln_Tarnation: i forgot wars can break teams fears
[1:12:25] sixthycent: go rets
[1:12:33] sixthycent: dmark after bubb. its gg
[1:12:40] zomnipotent: level banding makes quitting and restarting really chill
[1:12:46] alarakthedarkener: wraith is something you have to spec into… and death’s advance isn’t really decent for mobility
[1:12:58] ItsJhelo: Retail>SoD
[1:13:00] buffevoker: This what rogue does to mans having that pikaboo hair
[1:13:24] ImShmoly: yeah its probably easier to run cold blood and macro it into kingsbane, crits 300k
[1:13:34] maenkins: is that gladiator on the right? looks a lot better than the stock one
[1:13:43] turbonerd1185: Is fistweaver easy to pickup in 2s?
[1:13:55] d_mag4: Is aws cup 2 today ?
[1:14:03] Mothgar: @venruki Why are so few gladiator this season compared to previous? Especially on EU servers
[1:14:03] Deyconn: @d_mag4 yesterday
[1:14:15] heymomimonttv: assa isnt bad, it's just easily the worst of the 3 specs
[1:14:18] ImShmoly: its just squishy compared to other 2
[1:14:22] Mhortai: Morning @venruki !
[1:14:25] nightmxz: Did my team training Crusader inspire you? rukiCreep
[1:14:26] alarakthedarkener: @mothgar isn’t that due to no inflation yet?
[1:14:28] Daviejones72: its dmg is fine its the survival
[1:14:31] mrmsix6: assa has kidney shot, and that's basically all you need
[1:14:33] Darko_sKiLLz: if you want a real challenge try feral
[1:14:34] Texdizzle: worst of the the 3 specs and the only one that does big dam lmao
[1:14:36] d_mag4: @Deyconn Sorry, AWC =(
[1:14:42] Darnias: is that DfA on -
[1:14:46] Mhortai: Doing well. Getting the little one ready for school lol
[1:14:46] nightmxz: lmao glad to hear it, I think assa is super underrated
[1:14:49] Darnias: havent seen it since wod
[1:14:50] ItsJhelo: @Mothgar Bad inflation, and blizz limiting rating gain at the start of seasons.
[1:14:59] Mothgar: @alarakthedarkener Doesn't inflation start pretty early in the season?
[1:15:05] kromg: its actually crazy how far they got playing rogue mage hpal
[1:15:07] Mothgar: @ItsJhelo So it will get better the rest of the season then basically?
[1:15:09] kromg: lol
[1:15:27] alarakthedarkener: @mothgar yeah, but they tend to inflate rating near the end too
[1:15:28] absterge: crazy how well they did playing rogue mage
[1:15:28] Grimm303: plus they have an absolute hero healing
[1:15:44] ItsJhelo: @Mothgar Yes, essentially blizz has incentivized people to play closer to season end to earn rewards. Cause at the start of season 3k xp players are hardstuck 2.4k
[1:15:47] Mhortai: @absterge Nutty
[1:15:53] ImShmoly: what made them play with the miestro out of all healers
[1:16:03] absterge: content @greenmich17
[1:16:17] ImShmoly: LUL
[1:16:18] methudz: Carl empressWave
[1:16:36] absterge: rukiWave
[1:16:37] methudz: Gz on the win bro!
[1:16:45] Mothgar: @ItsJhelo Seems like a shame.. So the pvp season is basically last 3 weeks of an expansion in terms of rating push
[1:16:55] ItsJhelo: @Mothgar More or less yeah
[1:16:55] wyldeshock: take that back ven
[1:17:06] wyldeshock: we don’t like being trained
[1:17:10] wepess: Yo, what would u recommend me to play when we sometimes play with my friend resto druid? We play 2s and we have practicly no xp we just sometimes play and get to like 2K and then usually stop because of irl stuff for a while :D
[1:17:37] Paneledone: Morning Ven!
[1:17:39] ALLtheEXP: @wepess 2k is pretty good lol
[1:17:48] tipthescales117: Hey Ven, can show Talents? :)
[1:17:48] Caedalade: more ele sham as well
[1:17:50] zomnipotent: eu edgelords confirmed
[1:18:20] ItsJhelo: If you dont have a rogue you dont make top 6
[1:18:24] myodoctor: we know rets op
[1:18:27] Paneledone: Yeyeye
[1:18:37] PromiscuousToilet: PauseChamp
[1:18:47] alarakthedarkener: ret is op?
[1:18:50] PromiscuousToilet: ^
[1:19:18] soddi: Looking
[1:19:25] kreyzy8: I think you mean sub
[1:19:27] bigmancamx: hoolibang is a sub rogue
[1:19:27] tjhapsic: isn't holibang sub
[1:19:32] alarakthedarkener: fist Ret war?
[1:19:35] krisdahaka: !bracket
[1:19:35] wepess: @ALLtheEXP Well last time we played was in sl so we probably would be glad to get to 1,8k now :D
[1:19:35] Nightbot: https://raider.io/events/awc-dragonflight-season-3-cup-2-europe/brackets/open-bracket
[1:19:35] baxter5569: but rogues are "fine"
[1:19:46] PromiscuousToilet: what im seeing here is ret is op and needs nerfed PepoG
[1:19:49] wepess: Cant decide which one between dh unholy or ww
[1:20:05] kreyzy8: I do kinda feel like we're ignoring that almost all the outlaw teams play with a destro LUL
[1:20:11] phanabananana: Of course Ret has to play some cheese shit with a fistweaver lol
[1:20:11] mrmsix6: if some shit like feral or enhance dominated tourneys like that it would be nerfed instantly
[1:20:14] kreyzy8: also many of the DH teams too
[1:20:26] ItsJhelo: @kreyzy8 Nah because destro NEEDS certain comps to be at that level
[1:20:38] PromiscuousToilet: @mrmsix6 its a popularity contest Sadge
[1:20:43] nightmxz: If you don't have every button on CD in the first 20secs you're trolling
[1:20:47] PromiscuousToilet: ^
[1:20:49] AndroniusMaximus: When the disc out dps's the arms warrior XD
[1:20:57] socbrotes: mod, can I get link permit for the bracket please
[1:21:00] myodoctor: fister needs ret and ret needs fister. Mage rogue players are jelly of someone having better synergy than them
[1:21:00] wackpoetic: O
[1:21:10] kreyzy8: they were actually playing WW/destro mainly yesterday
[1:21:11] wackpoetic: I've started watching Fargo and I like it
[1:21:12] malvarcla: soooo dk and ww op then right?
[1:21:15] alarakthedarkener: frost dk sucks though
[1:21:24] crymorre: how many of those have warlocks too
[1:21:29] kreyzy8: @venruki count how many destro locks there are
[1:21:37] Satiduck: better nerf that frost dk
[1:21:38] Telarius1: alot of destros with outlaws
[1:21:40] tjhapsic: Are there just no good NA dh's?
[1:21:43] xvpsp: Love that song ! :D
[1:21:44] PromiscuousToilet: better nerf chillstreak for sure
[1:21:47] heymomimonttv: there's retwar fist in both regions?!
[1:21:50] Deyconn: trill is good
[1:21:57] ItsJhelo: I mean trill is a freak DH
[1:22:01] mrmsix6: "good DH" is your keyboard plugged in?
[1:22:03] alarakthedarkener: EU likes to play a safer meta
[1:22:10] What_ln_Tarnation: trill won awc on dh iirc
[1:22:15] buffevoker: Seems like blizz have to nerf Dks next week
[1:22:19] alarakthedarkener: outlaw is mechanically better
[1:22:21] jporter_: pls no rsham nerfs
[1:22:25] atarri1: Weird how the meta differs
[1:22:27] PromiscuousToilet: arent DH with eles which not many ele in NA
[1:22:27] crymorre: honestly, this seems to happen a lot. competitors will gravitate towards playing what's best because why bother playing with a handicap. for them, it isn't impossible to just pick up a new spec and play at a high level.
[1:22:32] Nickystr1x: yeah but the echo players are notoriously 1trick wonders, never swapping to meta stuff /s
[1:22:32] Telarius1: ya cuz outlaw kinda smashes DH in general
[1:22:36] ItsJhelo: NA just has fire rogue's, so no need for the DH
[1:22:36] alarakthedarkener: EU likes to experiment more
[1:22:38] Telarius1: Does what it does, but more cc, more surviability
[1:22:45] ItsJhelo: Outlaw is better than DH imo when played at the same level
[1:22:48] alarakthedarkener: NA likes to perfect cookie cutter metas
[1:22:49] kyaii: Didn't cdew's team start playing destro/outlaw over boomy/outlaw too?
[1:22:50] FateIRL: trilll is great on dh but boomy outlaw is better
[1:23:07] SwiisH_Tv: after watching quals 1 and cup 1. Quals 2 yesterday, I can 100% say nerf hunter.
[1:23:08] PromiscuousToilet: @alarakthedarkener i always found EU has way more boring comps than NA
[1:23:21] heymomimonttv: @venruki did i read that right? there's ret war fist in NA AND EU?
[1:23:27] alarakthedarkener: @promiscuoustoilet they have MUCH more variety
[1:23:29] ItsJhelo: He has said that many times
[1:23:30] skew_yew: that’s because dh is boring
[1:23:35] xvpsp: problem with trlll its his good with all meelee :'( too good thisguy
[1:23:36] soddi: or it's just a consequence of gearing being easy, that people gravitate to what good instead of trying to master their main class
[1:23:37] DrewPBallz18: VEN I HIT 2100 ON DISC
[1:23:41] notshaney: @venruki you beat me and my friend one time and i didnt know it was your ign but i got off and uninstalled for a month and i saw your toon name and realized it was you
[1:23:43] kreyzy8: DH can be CC'd but a lot of the EU comps just pve and do dam so DH is a lot better vs stuff like that
[1:23:44] alarakthedarkener: NA will literally have like 3 comps
[1:23:51] PromiscuousToilet: @alarakthedarkener i will say that the couple comps that arent meta show up they are super different for sure
[1:24:05] ItsJhelo: I think its just due to outlaw being not only a better class at that level but more fun.
[1:24:44] alarakthedarkener: @promiscuoustoilet in EU they like to experiment with different comps to counter the meta… NA simply just perfect existing Metas
[1:25:00] shox987654321: Rogue so squishy
[1:25:21] alarakthedarkener: rogues are only squishy if you don’t know how to run away
[1:25:27] Badasti: oh mah gawd he's dusted off the good ole toes n dik
[1:25:39] PromiscuousToilet: play feral. youll die even when running away KEKW
[1:25:47] Grimm303: does assa not play 5 stack wound poison?
[1:25:50] Nateypww: I love venruki!
[1:26:31] PromiscuousToilet: i think Trill was on DH last night so maybe liquid is considering it
[1:26:41] DrewPBallz18: is assas good?
[1:26:46] wyldeshock: a month of ad free viewing is a long time. sub well worth
[1:26:53] Badasti: i have 3 weakaura reminders for garrote, rupture and slice if you want em
[1:27:01] jporter_: did you watch party all of NA? may go watch the vod
[1:27:08] yami96: dh trill is best trill
[1:27:08] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy exendem WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:27:14] Fragssgaming: do you think affliciton will come back into meta later this season or even next season?
[1:27:16] DrewPBallz18: U, Pika, Absterge are my favorite strreamers
[1:27:32] TINSTAAFL: mes ui is 99% weakauras
[1:27:39] Deyconn: lol
[1:27:41] nightmxz: Hell yeah brother, join the anti weakaura revolution (except to track your own procs cuz too much buff clutter)
[1:27:43] reaperz14: Crusader's UI was pretty crazy last night. Like no addons lol
[1:27:46] Deyconn: you can craft a piece now too
[1:27:50] Badasti: bros like i need a weakaura, im like i got a weakaura, bros like i need to not use weakauras... I feel like im in a relationship
[1:27:53] TINSTAAFL: I waited an hour 5 minutes at 2.2k
[1:27:54] jporter_: gearing a healer rn with fresh CR, I will make it pop
[1:28:08] PromiscuousToilet: @camrencyber i use 10000 weakauras and also hardstuck 1400 KEKW
[1:28:11] kreyzy8: the timing PogChamp
[1:28:14] yami96: @reaperz14 i want no addons in arena
[1:28:15] Extramediums: I drastically reduced my addons after cata, but with more complex and hidden buffs/stacking abilities/etc I still have to use a number of them to track
[1:28:16] Phreshbrew: still can't believe how many belts you got lmao
[1:28:25] DrewPBallz18: u gotta walk out in the grey riding yak in this ss
[1:28:28] nightmxz: I actually love hpriest healing because they only have 1 HoT and your buffs are so clean, rdruid you have like 8 buffs and 3 are wild growth from treants
[1:28:38] Telarius1: its a loop. it takes forever, so people go afk. then dosent pop
[1:28:41] PromiscuousToilet: I wish addons would be removed /shrug
[1:29:03] nightmxz: When I glance at my buffs to check stuff and I just see 2 rows of fluff
[1:29:04] DrewPBallz18: i mained resto druid for a while and finally figured out resto sham and sham is so much better
[1:29:06] soddi: IMO bloom management IS impossible without addons
[1:29:08] brontid33: Dh needs nerfs
[1:29:12] PromiscuousToilet: almost impossible to play without addons anymore
[1:29:15] kreyzy8: mega cleave lobby monkaS
[1:29:17] xvpsp: GL brother
[1:29:17] thickwide: it stops tracking after like 3 lol i just started a resto and it confused me to no end
[1:29:19] yami96: believe
[1:29:22] PromiscuousToilet: Deadge
[1:29:23] Badasti: yeah I think the Assa is the target here
[1:29:24] Telarius1: u good
[1:29:26] FateIRL: nah
[1:29:26] xvpsp: yes
[1:29:27] Daviejones72: yep
[1:29:28] Nakahet92: yea
[1:29:32] ripzaddo: YAPPP
[1:29:34] brontid33: Yup ur fed
[1:29:34] SwiisH_Tv: forsure
[1:29:34] orcrimmar: gasp, not a nelf/orc?
[1:29:35] Zerikko: cloak talent for phys immune?
[1:29:36] Rakitotv: 100%
[1:29:38] Telarius1: press feint and gg 40% less dam from all dh ability
[1:29:43] Satiduck: whats our mmr
[1:29:45] Extramediums: addons are fine, but when you're 'automating' so much of it like every ability an enemy uses, every cd they pop with warning sirens and stuff, that's more than I want to use. I rather learn them and have an internal clock for myself to have a good  idea
[1:29:46] crymorre: LICKA
[1:29:49] Badasti: i guess we just sit stealth until kingsbane and defensives are off cd LUL
[1:30:15] PromiscuousToilet: @Extramediums yeah. its gone so far that theres too much to track without addons. which imo is bad
[1:30:54] SwiisH_Tv: @Badasti so let your team get 3v2d majority of game.. tell me you go 0-6 without telling me LUL
[1:31:29] jukeandnuke: lol
[1:31:32] Deyconn: bop is overrated
[1:31:34] Grimm303: I think you had forb
[1:31:36] MitssORLY: did i see a 500k crit? holy
[1:31:37] crymorre: must protect the bops at all costs, you must be sacrificed
[1:31:37] Grimm303: from loh
[1:31:38] yami96: john gonna 1 deag u
[1:31:42] kubie: he'll bop in 2-3 business days dw
[1:32:02] PromiscuousToilet: Ret bopping someone is a dmg loss. Not worth

[1:34:37] Fragssgaming: do you think affliction will be meta again at some point? later this season or next?
[1:34:46] brontid33: Warr
[1:34:48] Stoichulk: I was hoping you were  going to do it after you said you were last night!
[1:35:16] reaperz14: anyone in chat know what this song is called
[1:35:50] reaperz14: nvm!
[1:35:55] malvarcla: @reaperz14 idk
[1:36:04] idiot_63: @reaperz14 idk
[1:36:33] braindeadjoseki: ffeel good drag
[1:36:58] AnguishTM: Feel good drag by Anberlin
[1:37:10] Sosatko: Ven you have to shake your screen back and forth like a maniac to fully embrace the cringiness of rogue
[1:37:11] AnguishTM: @reaperz14
[1:37:22] sbrees: poor hpal
[1:37:33] DrewPBallz18: use sub
[1:37:50] xenoie: you gotta yell ONE SHOTTING then do no dmg. that's the trick to fake them out
[1:37:54] jayyArrington: trust me it look tough playing rogue lol
[1:37:58] Deyconn: push serrated more too
[1:37:59] Owlbear777: I think that stunning them while he's bubbled is a little useless ngl. As a Hpally, I hate when I bubble at like 5% THEN a Dh drops Darkness at my feet like he did something for me.
[1:38:01] baxter5569: @venruki im working on my shaman getting battle mender, do you know if you keep it after the season or is it going to go away?
[1:38:02] MrKitty92: Lol
[1:38:03] FateIRL: poor pally lmao
[1:38:05] soddi: Sadge
[1:38:06] waelrick: LUL
[1:38:06] driftwood_tc: Pala just given up LULW
[1:38:10] RedeemedbyJesus: Ven do most of you guys at the the top tier of SS sub 2 accounts to keep the time sitting in queue down? Can't decide if it's worth it to keep on subbing with just the 1. Playing like 3-4 shuffles during the day (only time I can play with a baby) a day for 2-3 hours of wait time is rough
[1:38:10] VetisBR: poor guy threw in the towell
[1:38:11] Diddly_dope: pally quitting game
[1:38:13] waelrick: bro had no chance LUL
[1:38:15] Diddly_dope: pally heading to sod after this
[1:38:23] wyldeshock: so rude
[1:38:26] ZhangTuShi: @Owlbear777 they can pop bubs mate
[1:38:31] tipthescales117: poor pal:(
[1:38:43] timmah25: if he had just bop'd you first round lol
[1:38:52] jayyArrington: def is man
[1:38:53] Deyconn: lmao
[1:38:58] LilDilly: p pants
[1:38:58] tangell0s: this isn't a coward stream here paladin
[1:38:59] Texdizzle: WOE IS MEEE
[1:39:00] Owlbear777: He bubble on a pillar, he can line the Shatter IF he has it, and the Dh can't bop bubble
[1:39:02] epksaucelol: dog of the lob
[1:39:04] Deyconn: cry baby pee pants
[1:39:04] epksaucelol: pala
[1:39:04] Bourbons86: that hpal just threw 2 games in my last lobby too
[1:39:07] brontid33: Toxic dickhead is what he is
[1:39:08] tipthescales117: true
[1:39:09] cleominajj: whats this song called
[1:39:12] OjBarnes: Had a ret pally do the same to me because he didn't bubble
[1:39:14] gdodmebxu: Cry baby pee pants KEKW
[1:39:15] Bourbons86: he was 0-6 going into round 5 then just threw last 2 rounds
[1:39:16] TINSTAAFL: damn. big words. big truth
[1:39:18] jayyArrington: just embrace the 0-6 it’ll feel better at end lol
[1:39:19] mrmsix6: Kingslayer
[1:39:22] squarepusher_: No bully! BibleThump
[1:39:22] shikari01: report him
[1:39:26] Owlbear777: So all Ven did was put them on Dr, I'd be saving my hoj/blinds for the Dps if I were the Hpally
[1:39:30] DaraxBarex: lmao imagine waiting 50 mins for a healer like that... pvp... lmao
[1:39:33] cleominajj: whats this song called @venruki
[1:39:36] brontid33: Report him it is a form of match fixing
[1:39:41] ripzaddo: he can afford to with 2 min queues
[1:39:44] Bourbons86: I did
[1:40:02] mrmsix6: @brontid33 Kingslayer - Bring me the horizon
[1:40:22] brontid33: @mrmsix6 i didnt ask hehehe
[1:40:32] dipicat: assa is some ass
[1:40:36] mrmsix6: wrong guy LuL
[1:40:38] dipicat: fought pika in shuffle at 24mmr yesteday with him on ass
[1:40:42] ferahgok: you tend to get kited a lot
[1:40:43] brontid33: Rogue is only good when yiu play outlaw or subt
[1:40:43] Bourbons86: agreed
[1:40:51] tsukoyi: rogue would be more fun if it was deleted
[1:40:51] dipicat: think assa needs a really particular envrionemtn
[1:40:54] Swolbasaur: Thought on FW/DK/DH?
[1:40:55] Bourbons86: i love assassination in 2s but hate in shuffle
[1:40:56] dipicat: assa only killable rogue spec but dmg is good
[1:40:57] Flukeyy: the few times i play solo shuffle at all i just que as healer and then i just heal and try to avoid cc and ignore chat xD
[1:40:59] soddi: ya, it's gold if you can tell your mates via voice upfront the stun so they know they can freecast
[1:41:01] ImShmoly: assa affli is pretty good rn imo
[1:41:03] buffrogues: is total ass
[1:41:05] ImShmoly: in 3s
[1:41:11] PromiscuousToilet: imagine if rogues were just dogshit overall. zero use even in niche situations. just once KEKW
[1:41:20] mnowpsn: Rogues have kidney Shot and dance and blind as every spec assa isn't bad
[1:41:27] Deyconn: insane
[1:41:27] mnowpsn: Imo
[1:41:29] dipicat: i think its only rogue and arcane mage that are unkillable
[1:41:31] NightMunchies: sup ven good morning bud
[1:41:35] MrKitty92: Really putting your career on the line with that take
[1:41:38] Texdizzle: u cray
[1:41:41] buffrogues: affloc fury assa total trash
[1:41:43] ZhangTuShi: ele and ww are hard too
[1:41:46] dipicat: yeah dh passive healing needs  a nerf
[1:41:48] dipicat: and glimpse too low of cd
[1:41:50] dipicat: 100% agree
[1:41:51] brontid33: Dh are really unkillable
[1:41:59] brontid33: And ridiculous damage
[1:42:06] Owlbear777: Remove Glimpse pls
[1:42:06] TINSTAAFL: dh with a monk healer is so unkillable in 2s
[1:42:06] generalrodrigo9: Play dk. Super billable
[1:42:19] PromiscuousToilet: DH cleave and ST dmg is the exact same rotation KEKW
[1:42:23] NightMunchies: frost DK
[1:42:38] Baker_ice: frost DK
[1:42:43] TINSTAAFL: blurs. nether. darkness. cacoons. revival. it is so toxic
[1:42:50] brontid33: Cant wait for cata pvp
[1:42:55] brontid33: No DH around
[1:42:59] soddi: 33% of a socket Pog
[1:43:21] Flukeyy: its enjoyable to play DH in arena, just go in press random buttons, trade cooldowns and win
[1:43:43] NightMunchies: LOL alll they're is 3 button class
[1:44:02] buffrogues: plus assa bleeds and poison’s can be counter easily by a lot of specs
[1:44:13] brontid33: No respect for dh players whatsoever
[1:44:20] Owlbear777: Dh is just very forgivable. Fought Rdrood/Dh at 2300 last week and the Dh was literally playing like a 1300 player, but Rdrood op heals kept him alive until dampening and it got harder as dampening got higher
[1:44:25] brontid33: Hqhaha
[1:44:42] kusoneko: BUFF AUG
[1:44:43] redbeard_79: @venruki fantastic mog 😍
[1:44:46] Guettalx: thats why theres alot of them, and because they are crazy good
[1:44:49] Tyferious: Are you playing rouge as well?
[1:44:51] NightMunchies: i dont enjoy evokers i do enjoy Dh
[1:44:51] Texdizzle: the room for error is wide and far
[1:44:52] Owlbear777: You can make all the wrong plays and still win, so forgivable.
[1:45:03] brontid33: Damage is crazy, and they never die and bour is back every 10 seconds
[1:45:12] brontid33: Blur*
[1:45:15] Deyconn: i wish there were more mounts for the vicious saddles
[1:45:31] Infidel_Tech: rukiHmm play your Aff!
[1:45:46] DaraxBarex: wow thats a surprisingly fast queue
[1:45:55] Robinhooez: Have you ever seen the DH vs healer video meme?
[1:45:59] Flukeyy: and now you sit 50 minutes
[1:46:09] knappster15: Venrrrrrrrrrrrrruki
[1:46:14] DaraxBarex: 50 min queues as dps. RIP
[1:46:16] Robinhooez: LUL LUL

[1:47:41] Badasti: copies them?
[1:47:47] Badasti: like puts them both up?
[1:47:57] gio_jitsu_: playin dh has definitely helped me learn how to shut them down.
[1:47:59] NightMunchies: ass rogue u can do that
[1:48:06] Swolbasaur: Blizz really need to fix SS queue time for dps it said average time in queue 14 mins and then 50 mins later.
[1:48:11] Tyferious: Is assas rouge the easiest spec to play? out of the 3?
[1:48:16] driftwood_tc: oh fuck off... I have it rough enough as boomie, dont need you telling people to train us harder FeelsWeirdMan
[1:48:25] chaps_86: @Tyferious offensively yes
[1:48:26] 3mirrors: always knew he was a boomie hater, poor supatease
[1:48:29] buffrogues: death mark use when u get the big garrote when u break stealth max damage
[1:48:30] brontid33: Garrote > rupture > bonespike > kidney > deathmark > kingsbane > envenom > envenom > envenom
[1:48:39] DaraxBarex: @Swolbasaur fr but i dont think pvp can be saved tbh unless we get huge influx and interest from new/exisiting players
[1:48:41] MrSt33z: BIIIIIIG DAM
[1:48:58] NightMunchies: i find Ass rogue lil hard to play  but once u get the hang of it its Awesome

[1:49:30] NightMunchies: no way not squishy if you're geared
[1:49:33] Bubav2: @venruki what do you think your "main class" is of all time?
[1:49:43] brontid33: Mage surely
[1:49:47] chaps_86: squishy compared to the other 2 rogue specs
[1:50:10] Bubav2: Well i've known him from WW monk @brontid33

[2:20:06] zachgamegodx: it’s like a mini death mark  when he says it’s fun
[2:20:23] Dirkdigglier: Everyone in this lobby taking stun dr like there is no assa rogue on their team

[2:21:06] Jrexlol: why not outlaw?
[2:21:11] schiniie: always happens in my lobbies
[2:21:16] Unnamed1391: dh broke sap to so war was able to peel the opener, then broke blind and died KEKW
[2:21:18] SwiisH_Tv: this is why climbing as sub was alot harder than people thought everything on random dr all the time
[2:21:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[2:21:24] Dashinqly: is that a bug? just tuning in, how does he have 5 wins, but just lost that last round when it’s the 6th round

[2:23:22] stealthwalker99: From my experience playing with Sinepy in shuf he kills the first person that trinks in a smoke bomb, the first go is just to bait trinks
[2:23:23] zachgamegodx: i wanna know why vengeful retreat removes disarm and ppl don’t complain about that, you can’t peel those things, meta your 30 second cd normie storm bolt, meld your coil, vengeful retreat your disarm off

[2:26:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brewmaster got its keg smash nerfed a bunch compared to what it used to be
[2:26:45] robboduels: brew is the wave. everyone is welcome to surf it
[2:27:10] Somanie: Bdk no longer the wave?
[2:27:21] zachgamegodx: ven played a good amount of brew, it’s like ww monk but much less effective
[2:27:33] zachgamegodx: 50% weaker ww
[2:27:57] zachgamegodx: it’s just called w
[2:30:21] robboduels: it’s not about the strength or weakness of it @zachgamegodx it’s about sending a message. you wouldn’t get it 😪😪

[2:33:09] Blitzylive: no poisons lol
[2:33:10] WardenDOTA: assass without poisons lol
[2:33:25] DegStaerian: yooo, couldnt watch NA games yesterday, worth to check out the VOD?
[2:33:27] danger_daft: yeah but DH is cheesy
[2:33:30] notMase: @venruki is jaime cheating
[2:33:33] Badasti: thats how I feel on most classes
[2:33:36] WardenDOTA: half the classes are pointless compared to dh
[2:33:41] Ty_theUberguy: thats how i feel on feral
[2:33:44] snarky03: Not having poisons is like 80% damage loss
[2:33:53] figurines: Mes said Jaime def. isn't cheating. *shrug*
[2:33:57] Badasti: why am i sweating my balls off on my mage when i can just play a dh and do better
[2:34:06] addyz0r: wizk check him pc
[2:34:10] Koma01: ven
[2:34:11] notMase: @figurines chan said he def is, hard to know what to think KEKW
[2:34:12] rerolleralways: its would be weird for him to cheat when played the game for so long
[2:34:14] SlogreTheOgre: @Badasti because being a wizard is fun :D
[2:34:20] robboduels: sterge said there was a kickbot in awc didnt he?
[2:34:21] zachgamegodx: take the poisons off
[2:34:33] FateIRL: infernion also says he cheats
[2:34:41] ImJordanHi: People who say he was cheating though, now say he doesnt..I feel like people just flip flop on it a lot
[2:34:42] addyz0r: it's the meme about wizk
[2:34:43] figurines: rumors are life
[2:34:52] WardenDOTA: its not a meme bro that shit was not legit lol
[2:34:57] Badasti: didnt he have like the 98% kick accuracy or some shit
[2:35:05] W00dyyx: Pro players should be subject to random PC drug tests
[2:35:16] Somanie: Haters
[2:35:22] Somanie: Prob
[2:35:28] Magottx: IMagine how good it feels if hes not cheating. like hes really that good half the interent thinks hes a cheater
[2:35:29] MARREMEISTER: well this is what LAN is for...
[2:35:29] hmmsicle: @venruki what are these queue times?!
[2:35:34] figurines: too much not knowing. cheat detection in wow is a joke. thats the real issue
[2:35:35] 3mirrors: i just consider everyone to be a cheater, problem solved, no drama
[2:35:36] Somanie: Wanna create a bad impression and then act like they didn't create it
[2:35:36] DegStaerian: if he cheats and blizz cant figure it out with an in depth investigation, what does that mean for the pleb gamers on the live servers? rukiHmm
[2:35:41] WardenDOTA: i don't think bots have perfect kick accuracy i fake pokemons bot all the time i think they cant be perfect because of lag
[2:35:43] Badasti: i think when you have almost perfect kicks etc then it becomes statistically impossible to not be using some sort of script
[2:35:45] Koma01: @hmmsicle expected
[2:36:13] notMase: absterge thinks hes cheating too, but sterge has a history of accusing people of cheating and not being able to prove it
[2:36:15] ImJordanHi: I feel like that's why LAN is good...you can't cheat. I mean you could, but it would be pretty obvious to the admins watching your screen
[2:36:16] scallywagspecker: How do you queue on two chars at once?  Different accounts?
[2:36:17] Philand0: 2600 lobby seesh
[2:36:27] nikthevoker: they said last match he went 20/20 for kicks LUL
[2:36:45] dickman911: joined late, who we talking about
[2:36:51] Badasti: @notMase that doesnt mean he's wrong, that's like saying police have a record of arresting people where it cant be proven LUL
[2:36:52] WardenDOTA: jaime - top ele sham
[2:37:02] reedthesham: Bigdam
[2:37:12] reedthesham: the man with 18 enhance shamans lol
[2:37:29] WardenDOTA: I found the clip bro you said "i think nightbane's team will win" but looking at it again maybe you meant that they will win the previous matchup to get to face crusader
[2:37:59] OjBarnes: Played against Jaime in cup 2 yesterday, his kicks are clean but he also doesn't kick EVERYTHING (even if it's the same school or spell he has kicked). I think from what I saw, he's just very selective with his kicks, but who knows.
[2:38:08] GrimlockMMO: Hey Ven! Make sure to reapply poisons on the rogueski
[2:38:26] zerx_gg: fellas hes not reading chat during games
[2:39:00] malvarcla: I miss the old architects
[2:39:33] Magottx: Why does outlaw not die but assa does? what do they have
[2:39:41] zachgamegodx: whenever that guys in my shuffles i wonder how a guy with 4k games played is ..nvm
[2:39:49] Badasti: 40 min queue for this lel
[2:39:52] zachgamegodx: (the outlaw)
[2:39:57] Sundagar: @Magottx they reduce CD of cooldowns insanely fast

[2:42:35] Dirkdigglier: I dont like seeing feral since wild attunement. Feral just becomes a clone bot for their dps. Its not very fun to play into
[2:43:23] heymomimonttv: watching this is making me excited to play frost mage after work
[2:43:26] WardenDOTA: ya its annoying to play vs and annoying to play with
[2:43:56] WardenDOTA: @venruki I found the clip bro you said "i think nightbane's team will win" but looking at it again maybe you meant that they will win the previous matchup to get to face crusader
[2:43:57] nightmxz: What's your stat line on that character?
[2:44:02] Koma01: guess u rolled a low done LUL
[2:44:07] Koma01: one
[2:44:35] rockiyo: yeah true
[2:44:58] Koma01: click shuffle = /roll 0-6 nothing inbetween even matters lol

[2:49:51] Itankarenas: just teleporting everywhere LUL
[2:51:17] BMaStream: @camrencyber Playing a ranged class into melee is like playing a card game. When they use a gap closer, you need the right "card" to counter it. Learning those is the key
[2:51:32] OjBarnes: You reckon some of that is just time perception when playing one of them. For melee it's a long time you're away from mage, when on mage it's a short time until they're back on you, yknow @camrencyber
[2:52:23] stealthwalker99: It really is you get every cd from outlaw still not the target

[2:56:17] socknapper1990: Is outlaw that good?
[2:56:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: That Necrolord skeleton mage was crazy
[2:56:29] marvin1995xo: venruki allready gave up on rogue ?
[2:57:41] McLarge: @socknapper1990 Outlaw and Sub can't die. They have CDR mechanics attached to their defensives, and Outlaw also has more Stamina. Combine that with the control all 3 Rogue specs have and the consistent pressure Outlaw can do, and you have the best melee in the game
[2:59:05] kingofkaramja1: whats the diminishing return addon for the secondary stats you got?

[2:59:44] pr1me1989: bon appetit venruki
[2:59:54] Magottx: Destro portals one of dumbest mechanics in game. especially for the theme of the spec
[3:00:03] McLarge: You can basically trust that an Outlaw or Sub Rogue will press every defensive CD offensively, and still be unable to punish them.
[3:00:21] pr1me1989: is it morning at ur place?
[3:00:36] zachgamegodx: ur place

[3:07:24] capac_77: might you ever regrow beard?
[3:07:40] Eastr0n: @capac_77 HUHH
[3:07:41] WardenDOTA: the miestro has to tell his teammates to stop every reclone and resheep because otherwise they wouldnt use their kicks
[3:07:41] capac_77: u beautiful either way
[3:07:48] capac_77: HUH
[3:07:54] Eastr0n: LOL
[3:08:05] WardenDOTA: he also has to let his teammates know when he is one shotting someone so they know when to use their go
[3:08:15] McLarge: Big dam judge, one shotting them here
[3:08:33] Grimm303: have faith in the light
[3:08:45] danger_daft: is it any fear?
[3:08:47] driftwood_tc: spaghetti coding
[3:08:48] Bombdiggity3315: S P A G H E T T U
[3:08:48] capac_77: ones physical and ones bullshit
[3:08:52] primejusticegaming: fear vs incap i suppose
[3:08:53] Endoraesh: war fear is physical
[3:08:53] BMaStream: I think you can also do it during DH fear
[3:08:53] malvarcla: because you're blind
[3:08:54] Magottx: Also why you cant spell reflect preist fear
[3:08:55] Ambersulfr: LOL CAPAC
[3:08:59] Eastr0n: cant see if ur blind
[3:09:00] Ambersulfr: that made me giggle
[3:09:01] McLarge: I thought you could do it in Blind? I guess not
[3:09:03] thisisthotcaller: cant see who you wanna blind versus you can do this if youre scared yakno
[3:09:06] zerx_gg: if blind, how know what target?
[3:09:06] Xmentalzy: cause blind used to be a poison
[3:09:09] Blitzylive: obv if blinded you can't see
[3:09:10] zachgamegodx: why doesn’t physical cloak work on dh fear
[3:09:14] storm_chaser_ron: @Magottx you cant spell reflect any area ability
[3:09:14] Badasti: i dont know, can you explain to me why alter is dispellable and block is mass dispellable, but blur and netherwalk arent>?
[3:09:16] zachgamegodx: that’s the real question
[3:09:16] capac_77: oh blind was poison for real?
[3:09:17] chaps_86: @Blitzylive lol i was thinking the same
[3:09:18] danger_daft: they do make a good point..
[3:09:18] Badasti: coz thats some bullshit too
[3:09:24] Endoraesh: but blind is not a fear right?
[3:09:27] concrete_jabs: Can't see when ur blind, but you can see when ur scared @venruki
[3:09:30] Lazarinth: Because fuk you that's why (joke)
[3:09:33] capac_77: @badasti based
[3:09:36] chervz: the only consistent thing is inconsistencies!
[3:09:49] mvpala_tv: maybe bc war can play the talent where it doesnt break to 1 damage tick? just a thought
[3:09:50] malvarcla: if I can one shot Kil'Jaeden why cant I walk in an arena and just one shot a player
[3:10:04] storm_chaser_ron: @malvarcla skill issue tbh
[3:10:08] ralotheret: remove md from the game tbh
[3:10:09] Eastr0n: @capac_77 i know wat 77 means 👿
[3:10:23] gdodmebxu: @zachgamegodx because it's not physical cloak. It removes physical effects on use and gives dodge
[3:10:32] pr1me1989: you need to say "TOPPING YOU, TOPPING YOU :D hahah
[3:10:36] capac_77: REEEE

[3:10:55] bjak_: That poor priest
[3:10:56] zachgamegodx: @gdodmebxu true
[3:10:58] obviouslytai: BIIIIIG DAM
[3:10:58] heymomimonttv: @Badasti this is a damn good question
[3:10:59] storm_chaser_ron: the fact that warrior didnt break that blind was insane
[3:11:00] pr1me1989: hahaha from last night :D
[3:11:01] Bombdiggity3315: holy pally looks pretty fun
[3:11:03] McLarge: They can't deal with Ven's BDJs
[3:11:04] Itankarenas: feels like healer diff lobby

[3:11:55] pr1me1989: I don't like paladins in general. feels "slow" and squeeshy for me
[3:11:58] vmills: the “mistrosdeliverence” is what really got me
[3:12:01] capac_77: @eastr0n i know what the 0 means too
[3:12:17] ooPickleRicKoo: then why do I lose to hpal ? sadge

[3:13:08] danger_daft: ok 1/9 ads
[3:13:09] capac_77: give him the sac
[3:13:11] chaps_86: @AugustBurnYOU it really depends on the comp. most would probably argue rdruid is the best
[3:13:13] ooPickleRicKoo: @AugustBurnYOU still rdruid but 5% nerf and bear form nerf kinda brought them down a bit

[3:19:53] trashukkonen: thats why you play denounce
[3:20:02] WardenDOTA: denounce is so fucking bad
[3:20:04] driftwood_tc: the 90s FeelsStrongMan
[3:20:20] WardenDOTA: the other talents are pretty bad too tho
[3:20:26] jason7314: Crusader plays denounce
[3:20:26] mvpala_tv: nothing. ever
[3:20:27] WardenDOTA: divine vision ya
[3:20:27] primejusticegaming: searing glare
[3:20:35] privx: denounce is so bad
[3:20:35] WardenDOTA: searing glare is actually the best hpal spell
[3:20:38] trashukkonen: divine vision
[3:21:00] NightMunchies: what?
[3:21:12] obviouslytai: 4 seconds of missing. so goodge
[3:21:16] mvpala_tv: do you know about the judgment honor talents against boomies?
[3:21:19] Cocoapuffs1: searing glare into caster match ups not most effective tho
[3:21:31] WardenDOTA: i play caster and i get fked by searing glare all the time
[3:21:31] MrPadre_: if I get hit with SG during my go I'm very sad.
[3:21:34] obviouslytai: lol WUT
[3:21:36] gamerdadhooper: do you play other games in your "free time"?
[3:21:38] Vashida: because the healers dont dispell that

[3:21:48] obviouslytai: searing glare owns everything lmao
[3:21:48] AndroniusMaximus: noob question. What does denounce do?
[3:21:56] WardenDOTA: double searing glare such a huge tempo swing, any pally that manages to get a precog or bubble just busts out a searing glare instantly and its so annoying
[3:21:57] NightMunchies: searing mows people over
[3:22:13] kralix: @AndroniusMaximus makes the target take slightly more damage i belive
[3:22:21] WardenDOTA: @AndroniusMaximus it deals some crappy damage but makes them unable to crit for 8 seconds or so
[3:22:23] Mozaiczny: what is your stat prio right now?
[3:22:25] Aby3200: ven 2s?

[3:34:43] tydr1m: yo how long is the q usually at this rating
[3:34:45] FateIRL: this is a pg stream
[3:34:53] WardenDOTA: @cory_lockman its basically the play in everything, 3s too, just get max uptime on it and use it on cd
[3:35:39] mvpala_tv: ya the only rough thing ab the honor talent is you have to judge the boomy bc it removes an effect they have caused on you not just any effect
[3:35:59] WardenDOTA: also it only removes 1 effect right so they probably have moonfire and sunfire on you as well
[3:36:46] Kittensrcute: instead of saying "judging it" can you please say "BIG DAM ONE SHOTTING" instead
[3:36:55] twinbladeuk: 6-0 Pause
[3:37:00] mvpala_tv: I think it gets most recent effect
[3:37:05] doclovejr: 6-0 poggers

[3:42:41] primejusticegaming: I got banned for abusive language but when i asked them to provide the abusive language that violated the terms of service they havent responded
[3:42:43] cory_lockman: @aod0311x be careful man some sissys out there, the bans are real and def automated
[3:42:47] chaps_86: @Magottx how exactly did you phrase it

[3:43:23] Hobblefoot: @venruki Don't get me wrong it takes a lot for me to report. But I tend to get some really horrible people as of late.
[3:43:24] heymomimonttv: aw ven you cant make us take your side against jackie

[3:43:58] Cocoapuffs1: How would you abbreviate USA though?
[3:43:58] cory_lockman: @cory_lockman it can make everyone toxic (myself included). I tried to stop being toxic towards other people and just be toxic to myself, but the ban still happened. I was like dang are you serious.

[3:44:25] mrmsix6: not in common nomenclature
[3:44:27] Secretwombatbro: i mean at this point do you really want to be more closely associated with united states americans hehe
[3:44:30] Aphobiagaming: ur a north american
[3:44:32] heymomimonttv: i mean technically, but you're canadian, they're mexican, they're brazilian, etc. you go by your country and not your continent lol
[3:44:35] Cocoapuffs1: Its because its referring to USA
[3:44:36] chipncheese: ur north american
[3:44:36] menshika: Monroe doctorine showed that USA is above all in All Americas
[3:44:42] MathematicalWolf: its true from the technical sense, but in the common lexicon its false
[3:44:43] nikthevoker: yes, we ARE america LUL
[3:44:45] driftwood_tc: Do you really wanna be associated with "US americans" though? LUL
[3:44:45] NightMunchies: canada rules
[3:44:45] zachgamegodx: it’s murican if you’re from USA
[3:44:50] axariel98: The entire continent is called America, those who say it is false, go to geography classes
[3:44:50] Acurarx: people confuse and conflate race/ethnicity/nationality
[3:44:54] Schwenkyytv: if youre from the united states of America youre American
[3:45:01] FlyFYI: murica
[3:45:05] sorzhx: if you go to a foreign country and say you're american they're going to auto assume US
[3:45:06] heymomimonttv: @Acurarx agreed
[3:45:07] Falkhord: we took the phrase a long time ago. you’re Canadian
[3:45:07] skew_yew: don’t be upset cause Canada is ass
[3:45:09] Badasti: i cant imagine why anyone would care that a canadian calls him or herself an american
[3:45:10] Covlol: United States of America, Canada is really just the Hat of America.
[3:45:11] jukeandnuke: nope
[3:45:12] DontDv8: Thats like some one from North Korea saying they are Korean
[3:45:14] roldthor: canadian american

[3:45:25] Flynnzx: yeah im from america but I think its fine to say your north american
[3:45:27] ReiColdlight: well europe is a continent and we are being called europeans, no matter the country , so being called american should be for all countries in american continent
[3:45:29] Swolbasaur: We are North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA-ian
[3:45:29] jamesip87: English British
[3:45:32] Flynnzx: live and let live
[3:45:35] Badasti: 100%
[3:45:36] NightMunchies: pyu
[3:45:36] trobled: ive never thought of this topic but i agree with you honestly
[3:45:36] WardenDOTA: i mean we don't really call middle easterners "asians" colloquially but they are from western asia
[3:45:38] Aphobiagaming: united stated is part of America not America itself
[3:45:39] Phacelift: If you want to divide by continent, then say North American
[3:45:39] NightMunchies: yup
[3:45:41] roldthor: but you call them an italian
[3:45:41] Covlol: By that logic you can deff say you're american.
[3:45:41] storm_chaser_ron: americans coopting something like we own it is peak american (US resident here)
[3:45:41] aod0311x: american means holding certain beliefs in the constitution and bill of rights
[3:45:42] joyrex_j9: aint no italian calling themselves european
[3:45:42] ALLtheEXP: @venruki  we are all human
[3:45:42] Lazarinth: We are north american
[3:45:45] Mirnawz: how can i understand if someone is Canadian?
[3:45:46] heymomimonttv: you're north american sure, but not american. you're a canadian. nobody says "im north american or south american"
[3:45:48] Secretwombatbro: well what about south american countries
[3:45:49] ralotheret: what would Justin Bieber say to this
[3:45:51] roldthor: but as a whole you call them european
[3:45:53] axariel98: US PEOPLE NEED GEOGRAPHY CLASSES THEY ARE VERY IGNORANT
[3:45:54] Aphobiagaming: correct
[3:45:56] mishato: it might be because theres no other easy to distinguish the American nationality
[3:45:57] storm_chaser_ron: america is two continents though
[3:45:59] harri180: 2 american continents
[3:46:00] Secretwombatbro: i think they identify by their country and not south americans
[3:46:00] storm_chaser_ron: you're north american
[3:46:01] Babsx0: you're north american or south american
[3:46:01] codyallyn: in america, we call people by their country not continent
[3:46:03] Badasti: it isn't, people are just bored and stupid in 2024
[3:46:04] jukeandnuke: it's not "The American Continent."
[3:46:05] DontDv8: it the North American continent though not American
[3:46:05] legiontheworgen: but wait would that mean that's also the case for South America too?
[3:46:08] twinbladeuk: woke people say they do not know what woke is, so can a girl be a boy? Should a man play in female games?
[3:46:10] kubie: also central america
[3:46:10] alexandrebifano: if u brazilian u are sulamerican, as all countrys in sulamerican
[3:46:10] jfeliciano007: But India is considered Asia but no one thinks of them when hearing the term Asian
[3:46:11] dialupinternetconnection: So what do you call some from US? American American?
[3:46:17] ooPickleRicKoo: canadians are french americans
[3:46:18] spudink: there's not a north europe, central europe and south europe
[3:46:18] Dourme: Ok then grab a bud light and load your guns. You're American now buddy
[3:46:19] litzheim: You dont call people from Norway, Europeans...
[3:46:19] jamesip87: English British
[3:46:19] Gushingcoom: native american
[3:46:23] primejusticegaming: So the difference is that people coming from Canada and Mexico use their nationality to describe themselves. Where the United States of America describe themselves as being American
[3:46:24] codyallyn: we'd call you Canadian, we'd call Italy Italians etc.
[3:46:26] ancilx: I blame Canada, always calling yourselves Canadians so you lost the right to call yourself americans
[3:46:30] Frannzz: Some places only considering america as one continent as well no south or norht
[3:46:30] Schwenkyytv: people from brazil are south american
[3:46:30] vmills: nah USA took that from you. if you want it back come and take it.
[3:46:31] YouAint_VeryBusy: NORTH American
[3:46:31] PsyqoSupreme: Canadians being called "Americans" is like people from India being called "Asians". Canadians would more accurately called "North Americans". Global culture has accepted that people from the USA are called "Americans", so... the argument is kind of pointless
[3:46:32] jukeandnuke: nope
[3:46:33] aod0311x: yeah but being american means believing in the constitution and bill of rights ven
[3:46:35] twinbladeuk: no
[3:46:36] chaps_86: too broad
[3:46:36] sorzhx: it feels odd to call russians asian
[3:46:38] WardenDOTA: what do you call people from the US then? there's no easy abbreviation so that's why everyone uses "american"
[3:46:39] bollskis: our powers combined
[3:46:39] FlyFYI: they just call us westerners
[3:46:44] MrKitty92: If you're from the U.S., you're a 'Murrican.
[3:46:45] itsrikodeine: ya but who wants to be american xD
[3:46:46] Acurarx: @camrencyber I ain’t lecturing nothin. I just watch
[3:46:50] bollskis: america op
[3:46:50] Swolbasaur: Being American also mean being a superpower, so they want 'weaker' nations to be part of it haha
[3:46:51] Morodox: que up as holy so my que can pop
[3:46:52] WardenDOTA: LMAO
[3:46:52] SaltyBites: its like saying that italians are eurasians
[3:46:53] Badasti: @jamesip87 there's no such thing as British English, there's English, as there has been for 100's of years, then there's the shit everyone else speaks LUL
[3:46:54] chaps_86: staties
[3:46:57] marvin1995xo: us a,ericans
[3:46:57] kubie: staters
[3:46:59] ladidaada: What about Eurasians?
[3:46:59] WardenDOTA: rolls right off the tongue
[3:46:59] cory_lockman: @cory_lockman real talk try to not say anything in solo shuffle other than who you are going/ccing. It's not worth it. People will say worse stuff than you and not get banned or maybe they do. Also I tried to fight blizzard on this because the next offense is 7-day ban. They said I broke the rules of azeroth and wasn't nice to my peers. I responded, so me sucking ass isn't being nice to my peers? Maybe I should never heal again. I try to play every spec in the game. I'm not gonna be amazing at a
[3:47:00] Mirnawz: Turks are nor asian nor european
[3:47:01] yellowcake1: yanks
[3:47:03] Flynnzx: im shocked at some of my fellow americans being so stubborn on this lmao who cares
[3:47:04] ihavesmokedcrack: STOP WE DONT WANT YOU! we'll claim mexico! we dont need more liberals
[3:47:08] lfkappachupa: KKonas
[3:47:08] Secretwombatbro: but we
[3:47:09] xenoie: 'Mericans
[3:47:10] roldthor: back to back WW champs. we call ourselves what we want XD
[3:47:11] Secretwombatbro: are usa
[3:47:13] kubie: unitians
[3:47:19] Cocoapuffs1: So you aren't Canadian, you'
[3:47:23] Cocoapuffs1: you're just american?
[3:47:25] Hobblefoot: To be fair, most Texans don't call themselves Americans. They are Texans.  :P ....  Not sure if that is true, but I have heard that said before.
[3:47:31] kubie: @Cocoapuffs1 both
[3:47:31] MathematicalWolf: Mexico is technically the United Mexican States
[3:47:49] WardenDOTA: texas is morelike newfoundland just a bunch of weirdos
[3:47:53] azael: I think you're totally right by strict definition but it's also not really how language works, it evolves to mean different things & everyone knows American = US citizen now.
[3:48:00] Dourme: Earthling??
[3:48:02] jfeliciano007: You're a bot
[3:48:03] kubie: earther
[3:48:05] Hobblefoot: Human?   Debatable.
[3:48:05] Gushingcoom: you are cacah
[3:48:08] sheffy: oh, i'm a human too.  we're the same
[3:48:09] ALLtheEXP: as a US citizen, I think we need to elect Crusader as president
[3:48:09] chipncheese: north american

[3:48:19] FlyFYI: break the system ven
[3:48:20] waelrick: LUL  󠀀
[3:48:20] joyrex_j9: 'merican
[3:48:22] Swolbasaur: Go see what happen when you tell US immigration that you are american
[3:48:24] tedstaTV: thats what a us citizen says
[3:48:26] azael: Why not just call yourself a north American?
[3:48:28] jfeliciano007: Trumo and Crusader as VP!
[3:48:31] Secretwombatbro: good luck tackling that political nightmare
[3:48:31] axariel98: The entire continent is called America, citizens of the United States need to learn about geography.
[3:48:37] Lazarinth: A bit pedantic, but I enjoy the banter
[3:48:37] chipncheese: you and what army :)
[3:48:38] Roxxybolts: canada isn't american everyone knows that
[3:48:40] Aphobiagaming: so would you not identify has canadian?
[3:48:41] azael: Haha

[3:48:55] Rakitotv: quiet @Roxxybolts
[3:48:56] Juewellez: reclaim what is yours
[3:48:57] Covlol: Doesn't matter of the ring, North America is the continent and should be what you're calling yourself.
[3:48:59] hunchurio: you gonna play sod?
[3:49:02] Schwenkyytv: do people from brazil call them american or south american
[3:49:05] Morodox: I am Canadian and I am American
[3:49:05] Badasti: oh my, clutch those pearls
[3:49:06] xenoie: haters
[3:49:07] ALLtheEXP: I want Crusader to be the Commander in Chief and when he orders soldiers to attack a position in war he says "BIIIIG DAAMMM"
[3:49:14] ladidaada: I think Canadians are Arctican
[3:49:15] DavidiMig: European Scandinavian Swedish Human
[3:49:15] Hobblefoot: We are pretty deplorable people.
[3:49:18] OttoFrank1945: @venruki You're 100% correct, it's not even a debate but a fact. But indeed, people don't usually use "American" in that sense
[3:49:18] MaximumnNeo: the reality is most  Canadian, south americans and Mexicans dont want to be called americans, so regardless of whos right people dont like it
[3:49:19] Mirnawz: you've just destoryed the whole  european culture and so forth
[3:49:21] roldthor: they hate us cuz they aint us

[3:50:56] MathematicalWolf: the United States is also MASSIVE. there are more people in California than all of Canada
[3:50:56] azael: The US is a nice place to live & people are largely very nice & friendly. Just politically there's a lot of issues IMO which is a big part of the bad reputation internationally.
[3:50:59] chaps_86: Love Canada, just need to get Trudeau out

[3:51:42] wicked_wizurd: if it makes you feel better in 10,000 years when your fossils are being dug up there is a chance you'll be referred to as American
[3:51:43] aod0311x: canada has become a commie hell hole
[3:51:46] R1klus: Hey Ven what class/spec would you recommend for someone wanting to start getting into pvp as dps?
[3:51:47] ALLtheEXP: He hates him Kappa
[3:51:48] yooyoo1337: we should put trudeau in a rocket and shoot him into the sun.
[3:51:51] Morodox: me too @venruki cant come fast enough
[3:51:52] markaimfire_: Rooting for you guys up there
[3:51:53] chaps_86: See the ufc even where they were chanting Trudeau?
[3:51:53] jamesip87: is it like most of the world getting different elections this year
[3:51:56] Badasti: Canada deserves the kind of PM that eats apples and says it how it is
[3:51:58] Swolbasaur: let me guess you liked stephen harper?
[3:52:01] aod0311x: controleld by the wef
[3:52:02] Nachofez: i left canada because it was too liberal
[3:52:06] Roxxybolts: I got told I was too nice the other day do I need to channel my inner toxxy?
[3:52:07] WardenDOTA: @yooyoo1337 not wrong but he cant repeat that on stream
[3:52:13] storm_chaser_ron: im just jealous that trudeau isnt on the brink of death like our politicians
[3:52:17] DontDv8: everything is controlled by wef
[3:52:19] bollskis: @Nachofez HeyGuys
[3:52:21] xenoie: Ven for PM?
[3:52:35] cory_lockman: Its funny that people in US can't  name a president in any other country, but everyone in other countries know America's president
[3:52:36] storm_chaser_ron: these damn old farts need to get a hobby and retire
[3:52:36] chaps_86: priorities
[3:52:38] Hobblefoot: I think people outside of America lump it under one big umbrella when the truth is that it is crazy how many diverse communities there are depending on the city, state, county you are in.
[3:52:40] Badasti: PP actually reminds me a bit of Ven XD
[3:52:43] ALLtheEXP: Being nice my whole life has done very little for getting me where I want to be. But it's not in my blood to be anything but nice
[3:52:45] Bombdiggity3315: its better to say nothing in game than something toxic
[3:52:51] OttoFrank1945: I just decided that I'm going to run for PM of Canada. Can I count on your vote?
[3:52:53] Rakitotv: @Roxxybolts climbing to glad on DH in 2 days is toxxy roxxy
[3:52:57] storm_chaser_ron: @ALLtheEXP are you midwestern
[3:52:59] jfeliciano007: Why not over the ears headset?
[3:53:13] Roxxybolts: @Rakitotv l2p
[3:53:13] ALLtheEXP: @storm_chaser_ron No, I'm from SoCal originally
[3:53:21] Swolbasaur: There is a different between being nice and being a doormat, be nice but dont let people step over you
[3:53:26] Schwenkyytv: it causes cowlicks also
[3:53:26] DontDv8: dont want the cdent?
[3:53:27] jfeliciano007: man those things stretch the ear I hate those lol
[3:53:38] 3mirrors: plus the head indent
[3:53:39] 3mirrors: no thanks
[3:53:46] Hobblefoot: @ALLtheEXP Who care if it hasn't.  And if you adjust what you define as "getting anywhere" maybe you are much further along than you think.
[3:53:50] stalecheetos: I like in-ears way more
[3:53:54] WardenDOTA: looks like you made a full recovery that hair is luscious
[3:53:58] heymomimonttv: this has gotta be mudvayne's best song

[3:54:57] juggerxo: @WardenDOTA what happen to his hair
[3:55:06] pragma90: tough game for mw really, no bops for mage like hpally has
[3:55:14] ALLtheEXP: Venruki looks like a guy from America
[3:55:16] DontDv8: there you go!
[3:55:20] WardenDOTA: @juggerxo wearing a headset was causin problems
[3:55:20] spudink: canadians don't want to be called americans because they're obviously from india and china
[3:55:43] xenoie: ONE SHOTTING
[3:55:45] fistweaveurnan: Texas is the greatest state in the US buddy
[3:56:00] Hizuru1: @fistweaveurnan trochu ellll

[4:00:40] pr1me1989: ven is there any addon, when u are in LFG to see their progress. like raider?
[4:00:55] kelfeno: @ALLtheEXP i feel like that's my problem. i heal deep dampening but enemy healer has more pressure
[4:01:05] Hizuru1: @pr1me1989 it literally shows current rating
[4:02:19] legiontheworgen: yo current songs a bop. anyone know the name of it by chance?

[4:06:11] Holtan3111: i dont understand what to do as an arcane mage in solo Shuffle. Im really struggling. They usually dont focus me and i cant do any damage. Nothing dies. I cross CC and pop my cds, nothing.... help ven
[4:06:15] heymomimonttv: pretty crazy how the lock has more healing output than dmg
[4:06:18] cyborg1141: Sheep 🐑  the healer
[4:06:24] heymomimonttv: 35k healing vs 32k dmg
[4:06:42] axariel98: how that mage is in 2k
[4:06:43] Cocoapuffs1: its not register his pets dam
[4:06:48] Cocoapuffs1: thats why demo is low on details
[4:07:41] Sindec: It does. Dh just cleaves demons so that's why he is high
[4:07:56] Cocoapuffs1: na details doesnt show enemy pet dam
[4:08:04] ogdmt: a miesmare
[4:08:07] thebarnabyangel: has nether

[4:08:28] xoHOLLOW: these players are hurting me
[4:08:33] pr1me1989: bro how can you play that nightmare? they are "tunnel vision"
[4:09:20] Devcomz: Double Dh lobbies are the worst or the rare triple DH if you get it
[4:09:32] Devcomz: I unfort had a triple DH lobby a couple weeks ago
[4:11:35] chaps_86: the feeeeeed
[4:11:36] laalaaland22: zug :tf:
[4:11:41] Tiazx1: bop?

[4:11:55] KralHor: Late wall mainly
[4:11:59] kelfeno: @camrencyber they dont feel terrible but they're not OP for sure
[4:11:59] TitiLancsak: healing is so entertaining.. i wanna stick a nail into my peehole sometimes...
[4:11:59] gucciboo101: you getting trolled in this lobby son
[4:12:02] Hizuru1: OMEGALUL
[4:12:04] chaps_86: @camrencyber nah, just a different playstyle. Gotta be a lot more agressive
[4:12:12] pacopico85: Ruki, how big is your hands?
[4:12:21] KralHor: Lock wall pathetic
[4:12:32] FreddoB: pog
[4:13:12] storm_chaser_ron: neither DH took a chance at a double cc reverse magic there
[4:13:18] pragma90: lock doing t he same thing to the mw, what a blessing it is to heal shuffle
[4:13:43] chubmax: they running imprison I think. reverse is SS is gamblr
[4:13:54] Dirkdigglier: Ive run the numbers a few times and can confirm that pressing reverse is in fact a dps loss
[4:14:18] KralHor: Lol
[4:14:19] swolecolemole: triple DR fel erupt pog
[4:14:21] chaps_86: 2 dhs, no reverse
[4:14:37] chubmax: reverse in SS is iffy sometimes
[4:14:44] chubmax: I’ve reversed a healer and he trinkets anywYs
[4:15:10] KralHor: Zero awareness
[4:15:14] chaps_86: lol
[4:15:14] driftwood_tc: oh boi
[4:15:15] KralHor: Wtf is dh doin
[4:15:15] kreyzy8: LUL

[4:15:19] storm_chaser_ron: he had darkness the whole time LMFAO
[4:15:20] skydog70: That was a 2300 lobby? what the actual fuck
[4:15:22] thebarnabyangel: tough lobb dude
[4:15:22] chaps_86: community service achieved
[4:15:32] southparkbbb: sheffcurry is a menace
[4:15:34] danger_daft: only worth it to banish tyrant?
[4:15:36] cory_lockman: DH 1500 lobby is the same as DH lobby 2300
[4:15:38] Prplneon: saving all his CDs for next shuffle
[4:15:41] xantoor: just brain dead mongos getting rating..
[4:15:46] Hizuru1: KEKW
[4:16:19] Tiazx1: bop though? he lined for sure
[4:16:19] wackpoetic: Solo Shuffles have been miserable lately, so now I'm just playing full damage build as a healer
[4:16:36] wackpoetic: DSP will complain whether you play perfectly or not, so fuck them play for fun
[4:16:43] krisdahaka: clueless
[4:16:54] cory_lockman: barely out of line
[4:16:55] KralHor: Watch his wall
[4:17:03] zachgamegodx: everyone in solo is playing perfectly.. at all times..
[4:17:07] KralHor: There wasn't until like 10 % hp
[4:17:12] cory_lockman: he was trying to avoid the fear lol
[4:17:12] wtfs_a_twitch: that first flash of light hits for 60k
[4:17:13] Hizuru1: Healers actually playing solo will morph to Crusader rage KEKW
[4:17:19] kreyzy8: yeah he was tryna line the mage
[4:17:23] wtfs_a_twitch: imagine having a casted heal that does 60k heals
[4:17:37] kelfeno: yeah healing ss is the most tilting thing in wow pvp lol
[4:17:50] chaps_86: it was late damp
[4:17:51] wtfs_a_twitch: the flash you just did on him, before he lined the second one, was 60k
[4:17:53] danger_daft: SS  is just the worst in general lmao
[4:17:56] wtfs_a_twitch: oh true late damp
[4:17:58] wtfs_a_twitch: my b
[4:18:00] shadowwrogue: Whats ur enchent weapon ?

[4:18:19] chaps_86: @shadowwrogue its not an enchant, its just the weap
[4:18:23] forgottenmarsh: Appreciate your content 💯
[4:18:28] buzuzuk1: his wall was late thats all, the los was unfortunate cant blame him it was close
[4:18:35] Dirkdigglier: Your life is good again after a 40 min que haha
[4:18:46] Covlol: Wish DH/Outlaw would get kneecapped and lock would get a minor slap on death pact so the game would feel great again!
[4:18:49] jdmike06: Ven is pretty much teh only WoW streamer I watch
[4:18:51] shadowwrogue: @chaps_86 oh ok thanks man did you know the name of it )
[4:18:53] jdmike06: since MoP days
[4:18:53] KralHor: Fun healer is actually evoker, u can do some nice dmg, but the range sucks
[4:18:54] shadowwrogue: ?
[4:18:58] storm_chaser_ron: @jdmike06 same
[4:18:59] Jayzyzz_: @camrencyber somebody subbed the other day on ven's channel for 121 months lol
[4:19:10] Dirkdigglier: !followage
[4:19:11] Moobot: @Dirkdigglier Dirkdigglier has been following Venruki for 3y 4mo
[4:19:13] chaps_86: @shadowwrogue For the life of me i cant remember, im sorry =( I have the damn thing too.
[4:19:27] cory_lockman: @KralHor I agree. Alot of people hate it because they are not doing damage. If you do damage as pres-evoker you win games
[4:19:28] storm_chaser_ron: @Jayzyzz_ there are a few OGs around in the 100s for sure
[4:19:39] FreddoB: is it sod capthingy today?
[4:19:39] chaps_86: Ven, what's the name of that sword mog?
[4:19:42] Blitzylive: low rates/good warrior? kek
[4:19:51] chaps_86: TY!
[4:19:52] FlyingPuncake: im a good warrior i win almost 50% of my games at 1100
[4:19:54] chaps_86: couldnt remember
[4:19:55] shadowwrogue: @chaps_86 dont worry man its all good thanks for respond to me <3
[4:20:02] jdmike06: Ven was the Mage Frostfire thing from War Within already talked about?
[4:20:06] jdmike06: or video coming soon?
[4:20:15] jdmike06: aight
[4:21:00] Gushingcoom: how do people got that trading post enthusiast cheev already
[4:21:04] Gushingcoom: thought it was 12 months
[4:21:10] R1klus: Any tips for a mage trying to kite two melees in shuffle?
[4:21:19] Schwenkyytv: mag is a pver now too
[4:21:20] Locturnal_TV: you can only heal so much shuffle before you break
[4:21:27] R1klus: tyty
[4:21:36] Gushingcoom: oh damn 13 already
[4:21:49] chaps_86: @shadowwrogue Phosphorescent Blade in case you missed it.
[4:21:55] Flappell: !followage
[4:21:55] Dirkdigglier: Healing shuffle can be frustrating, but being able to log in and play right away is still really nice to me
[4:21:55] Moobot: @Flappell Flappell has been following Venruki for 7y 2mo
[4:21:57] jdmike06: ive become PvE Andy too. PvP Rewards need to be reworked and it needs way more cosmetics
[4:21:59] heymomimonttv: ven can you make a guide about positioning on mage too? that's the hardest part of mage for me
[4:22:29] mankz111: what is that ilusion in weap?
[4:22:41] KralHor: @dirkdigglier yeah, this... if the rewards would be a bit appealing, would be great
[4:22:49] heymomimonttv: ah ok thats fair, thank you
[4:22:54] WhereMaldo: thoughts on a 2250 title like champion or something?
[4:22:58] jontepman: PvP has more cosmetics than pve already lol. the sets, enchant and more, you get nothing in dungones except the recolored mount
[4:23:03] Hizuru1: Watch they say next season same rewards KEKW
[4:23:08] jontepman: but I still think a overhaul is needed for rewards
[4:23:08] WhereMaldo: feel like it would be nice to have something in between duelist and elite
[4:23:08] Jayzyzz_: i get streamers playing ss for content but i can't comprehend how or why normal players do it. It's so easy to meet people in LFG
[4:23:11] zachgamegodx: I’d sit at your phd defense
[4:23:30] heymomimonttv: one of my friends got to perform this song with 30 seconds to mars at a festival a couple months ago
[4:23:38] jdmike06: I also think that Battleground content not being consistently updated is a huge miss. It provides a very important on-ramp to PvP
[4:23:40] lumaday: Why are 3s dead during the day?
[4:23:40] Hizuru1: @jayzyzz_ only Giga toxic anti social people do that
[4:23:53] storm_chaser_ron: if you're in shuffle, you position as follows: if healing, you wanna be in line of teammates. if dps, do not let your healer make eye contact
[4:23:55] Ziffy151: my job makes it so I have to q during the day. its painful :(
[4:23:57] shadowwrogue: @chaps_86 thanks a lot man just find it to 0.94% drop xD so its gonna be a hard one to farm
[4:24:05] zachgamegodx: JOBS???
[4:24:06] zachgamegodx: gello
[4:24:17] ihavesmokedcrack: Dead retail is still better than round 9 of classic aka sod
[4:24:29] ATHLTE: ^
[4:24:33] Hizuru1: @zachgamegodx says dude sitting in queue
[4:24:42] Schwenkyytv: people work during the day and when they want to que at night they jsut do SS
[4:24:44] Vramii: yo Ven I listened to the "THHEY"RE STEALING MY MUSIC" playlist during my workout yesterday - was great to get me rocking
[4:24:54] ihavesmokedcrack: you can always go spend 46 mins walking from one place to another in sod!
[4:26:40] Jayzyzz_: @ihavesmokedcrack sod gamers hate themselves
[4:28:23] heymomimonttv: @ihavesmokedcrack "back in my day we used to walk 3 hours to school and 3 hours back. rain sleet or snow, uphill both ways!"
[4:29:33] orcrimmar: but it's not easy to meet people in LFG. imo, the pvp community is hurting itself. There are sooooo many people who are "glad/r1" and are gatekeeping the pvp scene hard. Not only that, but people will lose one game and instantly disband the group because "bad". Pvp community has no patience and most are unwilling to teach new pvpers so the new pvpers say "fuck that, im out. back to pve"
[4:29:57] Devcomz: @orcrimmar This 100%
[4:30:05] Hizuru1: @orcrimmar make your own group take people close to your rating easy

[4:30:43] Devcomz: What @orcrimmar said is why I keep reading and hearing people say they rather just do Shuffle then deal with LFG
[4:30:52] Jayzyzz_: @Hizuru1 yep, very simple solution. The vast majority of people looking are also noobs
[4:31:00] Hizuru1: SoD gets more balance update and tuning than DF lel

[4:32:41] Hizuru1: @camrencyber nostalgia and playing with streamers
[4:32:44] kelfeno: toolate we are offended > : (
[4:33:23] swolecolemole: we all know mr tren is the DH CEO, not up for debate habbibi
[4:33:24] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got A First Look At The Mage Hero Talents Coming In 11.0" view it here: youtu.be/-q4ekr2IRjA
[4:33:29] Matzefyr: dh? xd but wasnt Venruki a mage main in bfa? not trying to flame but what is it with these big streamers and fotm rerolling every chance they get.
[4:33:35] Jayzyzz_: @orcrimmar this is a cop out. I'll give you a bitter pill to swallow, everyone wants to play with people who are better than them, not worse. So you sign up for a group with someone who is better than you, and when you don't perform they inevitably flame. But if you list your own group as a newbie and clearly state you want chill games, and that you're learning and takings this slow, no sweaty player is going to sign up.
[4:33:36] Kikrino: Kikrino subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Dont bully Tren he is very sad now!
[4:33:48] zerx_gg: not trying to flame, flames
[4:33:50] zerx_gg: make it make sense
[4:34:10] Sibble7: @Kikrino who aren't you subbed to bro
[4:34:16] zerx_gg: ait ur OUTA here lil bro
[4:34:19] zachgamegodx: tren viewers what the highest essence break trens ever hit
[4:34:27] Kikrino: @Sibble7 I dunno some people xD
[4:34:42] FateIRL: thats the problem with lfg its easier ppl who are 1200 exp or r1 exp no in between
[4:34:45] heymomimonttv: @Jayzyzz_ idk man, i'm a relatively new player and have made friends in lfg when i'm upfront about being new, and they've helped me learn
[4:34:51] Sibble7: Tren is balls deep in some soup and garlic bread rn
[4:35:04] ChaosAccord: @TrenacetateTV best DH around :D
[4:35:04] Kikrino: True that haha @Sibble7
[4:35:05] Jayzyzz_: @heymomimonttv yep you're 100% right
[4:35:13] FateIRL: goodluck finding teammates when ur 2200 in lfg.
[4:35:41] wardelswijk: at 2200 either get better or quit
[4:35:42] Kikrino: Kikrino gifted a Tier 1 sub to Sibble7! They have given 18 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:35:55] heymomimonttv: @Jayzyzz_ i started playing in season 1, season 2 i was able to hit 1800 on a few toons. i've just kept learning and there's been some really great randos along the way
[4:36:07] Hizuru1: @fateirl game is made to not be played save money timeans effort play last weeks, month of season if you remember wow exist
[4:36:16] Sibble7: @Kikrino my sugar daddy <3
[4:36:17] eebrandt123: hey @venruki, you might have commented on this recently but where do you think this season is at inflation wise? seen some pro players (raiku primarily) consistently lobbying for more
[4:36:17] Sibble7: ty
[4:36:21] ChaosAccord: anyone answer this with insight to rogue- I just made/boosted to 60 (had an old boost) and @ starting point found I can get 3 poisons in some combos....is this right or a bug? I thought only 2
[4:36:28] Sibble7: @Kikrino Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:36:33] kelfeno: every gl;adiator druid in lfg is 1600 hardstuck
[4:36:33] xGriefxGodx: He's a galdinator.
[4:36:36] xantoor: druid ran the whole time
[4:36:38] zachgamegodx: gladiating
[4:36:41] Blitzylive: 2024 everyone says they are gladiators
[4:36:42] Kikrino: @Sibble7 <3 <3 <3 My sugar bruv
[4:36:44] FateIRL: blazing boost gladiator ?
[4:36:46] DaraxBarex: @heymomimonttv true ive met lots of randos along the way and been friends. But after 1.8k on most toons, i just quit pvp and go back to mythics lol
[4:36:47] kelfeno: i should know, i am 1600 hardstuck
[4:36:50] Jayzyzz_: @heymomimonttv like you said, as long as you're totally upfront to people about where you are in terms of skill, you're almost never going to be flamed. But almost everyone wants to sign up to groups with people who are much better than them, then they're surprised when they get flamed
[4:36:51] xantoor: gladiator of "watching"
[4:36:52] yo_shame: SL glads
[4:36:56] Sibble7: LMAO
[4:36:58] Blitzylive: asking for that CARRY
[4:37:00] Blitzylive: lol
[4:37:01] Schwenkyytv: maybe hes a glad just coming back to the game
[4:37:04] danger_daft: @ChaosAccord If you're talking about weapon poisons there is a talent on bottom of spec tree that allows for 4 poisons
[4:37:05] buttheadxl: was that gladiator healduff?
[4:37:07] YouAint_VeryBusy: BFA Glads
[4:37:18] Hizuru1: Flaming chat shame on you
[4:37:26] Sibble7: He plays the build you are running
[4:37:28] Blitzylive: no not you!! that druid is asking for carry with that
[4:37:31] Sibble7: He only plays immo for duels
[4:37:40] heymomimonttv: @Jayzyzz_ that's fair. i create a lfg and title it "chill games, gearing and learning" i've gotten sweats to join and help, and i've gotten other noobs to come in and learn and gear together
[4:37:52] danger_daft: Immolation is good against bleeds for sure but not sure what else its good for
[4:37:52] ChaosAccord: @danger_daft Thanks! I havent even looked at talents, just quickly searched online as I thought only 2- good to learn :D Thanks again!
[4:38:08] cannabiotics: just pretend, banger
[4:38:12] Dirkdigglier: You play that
[4:38:14] McLarge: A Fire Inside build is still very strong damage wise. It also objectively has better Fury generation
[4:38:14] chaps_86: in 2s 100%
[4:38:14] Jayzyzz_: @heymomimonttv we need more players like you in LFG for sure
[4:38:24] Kikrino: @venruki Look what Sibble said. He knows Tren in and out. Mostly in ;)
[4:38:32] Sibble7: @venruki Tren plays the build you are running, he only runs immo in duels.
[4:38:36] Sibble7: Lol kik
[4:38:38] Sibble7: you salty dog
[4:38:45] heymomimonttv: @Jayzyzz_ you're not wrong tho, there are a whole hell of a lot of people who join and leave after 1 or 2 losses
[4:38:47] Kikrino: trenLUL trenLUL
[4:39:03] kralzo: @Sibble7 yo sib, what about pvp talents LUL
[4:39:28] vmills: just A
[4:39:35] Schwenkyytv: welcome to america
[4:39:35] vmills: no N
[4:39:48] kelfeno: AFI great band miss murder is wow
[4:39:48] McLarge: You give up CDR on Eye Beam and CDE on Meta
[4:39:49] iiiidan1994: did dhs get buffed ?
[4:40:06] zachgamegodx: i think if trill was playing it, he was probably playing it with self dispel bc cdew made him try it
[4:40:12] McLarge: Looks Can Kill was really good last season when Eye Beam was a huge portion of your damage
[4:40:13] heymomimonttv: wow dh has a fire inside and looks can kill. very edge elder emo class lol
[4:40:17] Sibble7: @kralzo Glaive, glimpse, and switch between big incap or reverse depending on 2s or 3s. can run immo dispell if you're training a sham or druid healer
[4:40:19] zachgamegodx: since they face alot of resto shamans that root him across the map with no recourse for trill
[4:40:22] McLarge: Now it's ok, but not enough points for it
[4:40:28] iiiidan1994: its dog shıt unless you play eye beam talent but people dodge it mostly or interupt it anyway
[4:40:58] kralzo: @Sibble7 blood moon trash ?
[4:41:04] Blitzylive: Ven is too nice man
[4:41:20] Sibble7: @kralzo Blood moon pretty much only against locks pet for 20% damage increase
[4:41:22] dirtmcgurt0415: music choices always fire on ur streams
[4:41:30] OttoFrank1945: Lol
[4:41:32] Magottx: Ven is a straight bloodhound for non ethical comps
[4:41:32] heymomimonttv: LOL u better find a new healer in 30-45 minutes
[4:41:35] Sixf1ve: things are starting to make sense
[4:41:40] nuggetzwarr123: different music everyday
[4:41:52] wackpoetic: we need one of the venruki "Heeere we gooo!"s for that
[4:41:53] dirtmcgurt0415: @nuggetzwarr123 ik lol always good music
[4:42:01] nuggetzwarr123: 85% i agree
[4:42:08] kralzo: @Sibble7 do we change anything talent wise or run those all the time
[4:42:18] Sibble7: You never take glaive and glimpse off
[4:42:34] kralzo: non pvp talents i mean
[4:43:09] Sibble7: I mean you could at high level for sure.  like if you were playing 3s with a warrior or something that has MS you could switch MS for the heals one
[4:43:23] malvarcla: not glad on rdruid thats for sure
[4:43:51] Jerd9: he was 2800 in ss on monk
[4:44:02] kralzo: ty, saved me alot of research time <3 @Sibble7

[4:44:43] ChaosAccord: gotta give credit though, thats hard do do undergeared!
[4:44:49] McLarge: @Blitzylive That's because Ven is dead the whole game and can't really deal pressure
[4:44:53] Sibble7: What's the rating?
[4:44:56] Bonegraft: problems solve themselves
[4:45:54] Sibble7: Not getting dispells on DH is the end of the world literally
[4:46:09] McLarge: Wanna double DH with me? @venruki

[5:07:14] wackpoetic: Ye, it's weird, Punchmonk isn't a damage dealing healer; but it's healing throughput when it stays on target is insane. Feels like it should be more of an offensive playstyle to actually do damage and have to use healing cd's for your team instead of just facerolling to full hp

[5:09:33] betasoldier: the government doesn't take any of it
[5:09:37] 인터넷포트: its tax free if u do it the right way and dont withdraw early
[5:09:49] hiddensquid13: roth 401k - you pay taxes when you contribute and none on the back end when you retire
[5:09:55] therowdyone1: The idea is when you retire your taxable income will be lower
[5:09:58] Metaphors: 65
[5:09:59] storm_chaser_ron: @venruki you pay no tax when you invest into it, you pay tax when you withdraw.
[5:10:01] jroe034: 65
[5:10:04] storm_chaser_ron: you can withdraw penalty free at 65
[5:10:06] betasoldier: 65, for now, that could change in the future though
[5:10:11] ChaosAccord: is it 65 to pull? or 67 or somethin now?
[5:10:12] baxter5569: you can tke out whenever, but you get taxed on it before 65
[5:10:16] Locturnal_TV: i think its moving to 70 in the future
[5:10:17] hiddensquid13: regular 401k you don't get taxed when you contribute but pay taxes when you withdraw
[5:10:17] baxter5569: no
[5:10:19] jroe034: no
[5:10:22] hiddensquid13: there is early retirement at 55
[5:10:26] storm_chaser_ron: and animals in govt are trying to raise the retirement age so it may not stay 65
[5:10:27] 인터넷포트: optional but why not if ur employee helps out

[5:10:49] ShukumeiTV: roth ira

[5:11:04] ChaosAccord: we can have something like that that goes to medical stuff...but if u dont use it u lose it
[5:11:14] jroe034: ours is 6500 a year
[5:11:19] storm_chaser_ron: 7000 this year @jroe034
[5:11:20] ChaosAccord: prob more too- im a normal dude so dont know all the ins and out
[5:11:20] heymomimonttv: i have an HSA as well which is untaxed
[5:11:20] Tyferious: IRA stands for individual retirement account
[5:11:20] TheBoysCT: roth is just the name of it
[5:11:27] Metaphors: investment retirement account
[5:11:30] southparkbbb: you pay post tax dollars into a retirement account, then it grows tax free
[5:11:44] storm_chaser_ron: Roth IRA and Traditional are different and one taxes later, one taxes now
[5:11:47] 인터넷포트: Some states in the USA have no income tax and no capital gains tax. So u only pay the federal tax on investments
[5:11:58] ihavesmokedcrack: roth irl aren't taxable! but you can only deposit 6k a year
[5:12:02] b_lappy: I think max is $6k a year you can contribute
[5:12:06] betasoldier: @ChaosAccord There's two types of medical accounts for that. One you lose at the end of the year, one you keep and rolls over.
[5:12:20] Metaphors: its insane because its also not efficient
[5:12:24] storm_chaser_ron: @ihavesmokedcrack well the money going in is taxed, but yeah earnings arent
[5:12:28] Cocoapuffs1: it wouldn't seem insane if it was noticable of what it's doing
[5:12:29] jroe034: you have to contribute to it and can max it out every year. max is 6500 a year. and then once in the account you can invest it into something and you dont have to pay capitoal gain taxes on it
[5:12:32] 인터넷포트: yep thats why u gotta move to states with no income or capital gains taxes and just pay the 1 federal tax makes it a big savings
[5:12:34] gucciboo101: ven is always so careful on things he say lol
[5:12:39] heymomimonttv: im not against taxes, but in the US our taxes go towards all the wrong things. i wanna pay for public education, infrastructure, etc. not pay to line peoples pockets

[5:15:25] betasoldier: Realistically speaking most Americans tax money goes into social security. Most Americans don't pay income tax (gets refunded at the end of the year). Most of what we don't get refunded is going into social security.

[5:31:42] kelfeno: @JimsharkGaming DH/Lock is gonna be a lot more versatile in different metas. if cleave metas are weak DH/War is gonna suffer a lot

[5:42:06] 3mirrors: i have a pizza hut AND a dominos
[5:42:09] leeka: vancouver blows calgary away for food
[5:42:20] McLarge: Poutine is such a US dish that I'm surprised no one here actually makes it
[5:42:30] Kymagez: @3mirrors show off

[5:43:39] McLarge: @ziloclol You'll just get accused of being a bot, whether you are or not. If you don't care about that and you want to do it anyway, go ahead

[5:44:16] ChaosAccord: one thing missed is the options for really good food!
[5:44:21] heymomimonttv: ele was fun while i was learning the game but i've started to stop enjoying it. all you do is just lava burst and earth shock. you rarely get the feeling of outplaying people by getting off risky casts or anything, cuz everything you do is instant
[5:44:38] thedrenchgod: if you play ele well, you're a bot, if you dont play well, you still a bot just broken
[5:45:01] malvarcla: do the ele cheese build then
[5:45:35] heymomimonttv: @camrencyber but it's still fun to get big juicy chaos bolts and spam fear. ele has no spammable cc besides frost shock

[6:38:50] mayonaes: I would rather play against a good enh than a good outlaw rogue
[6:39:45] Hobblefoot: I notice Outlaw players do this weird wiggle thing where I swear they are shaking their mouse around 100 miles an hour just for the obnoxious way it looks in arena.

[6:51:30] Badasti: I'd actually be curious how high you can push a full crit mage
[6:51:34] fireruler96: @venruki , is it bad to play with 4 set as frost mage?
[6:51:36] Badasti: or a meme spec mage with unpicked talents
[6:51:37] FateIRL: the ww in eu used polearm, on howtons team. idk why might be good

[7:01:35] vmills: do you @wizkx if they kick yall out I will go leave a flaming bag of shit at HQ. I’m like 30 min away.
[7:01:38] everjaz: i mean thats kind of impossible in a social game with a very small % of top players lol
[7:01:40] Kymagez: yeah chan was going in on jaime
[7:02:00] Badasti: Blizzard should learn from Dana White and stop trying to police people
[7:02:05] Badasti: its none of their business
[7:02:07] dooshken: botters should be called out
[7:02:13] Badasti: what people asy

[7:03:59] antrax90813: TRAIN ME DADDY
[7:04:00] daryl_fish: hey, you can train me all day pal
[7:04:02] Hazythe4Saken: do you not have any quests? i don't see any? or are they just not being tracked?
[7:04:04] zachgamegodx: all i heard was "i lied!"
[7:04:07] jporter_: sounds so fun on paper to play spriest then when ya do its so frustrating lol
[7:04:07] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[7:04:08] chrisiirc: sp in SS is a target dummy POV
[7:04:12] chrisiirc: so annoying
[7:04:13] stealthwalker99: Day X of asking for the enh sham gameplay
[7:04:15] SteLawBro: Always better to be the bully than the bullied.
[7:04:19] Hizuru1: KappaPride chat
[7:04:20] terranapart: @venruki have you made a video no mage hero class abilties yet?
[7:04:26] gelatokush: so true lol
[7:04:30] OjBarnes: Radio Venruki is unreal
[7:04:31] poroyou: I play mage, you guys don't get trained all game?
[7:04:32] KluttsVonSnuggs: is it cause he bonked that link like a total boss
[7:04:37] gelatokush: sp only good in wiz hands
[7:04:39] Enazx: i did the same thing lol, saw wiz and thought this looks fun
[7:04:45] tmk1t: Sp only good in wiz hands bc he cheats
[7:04:48] wogxwog: I don’t know how Wizk does it man. It’s insane trying to cast against double melee.
[7:04:58] Shakertime: so many spriests out in the low ss now and theyre just dying
[7:05:02] chrisiirc: everyone watches wiz, tries SP and then realisation sets in KEKW
[7:05:04] explic_cit: what happens for a second warning? Do Ven and Ziqo have to go to sterge house and place a horse head in his bed?
[7:05:06] Jathela: Yo Ven hope you're having a good week
[7:05:25] dakila24: having a rogue to help you set up your damage feels like royal treatment
[7:05:30] AndroniusMaximus: maybe send some spriest 3s with the boys
[7:05:31] poroyou: Pie baking stream, when?
[7:05:49] tench000: wizk with pika's insane CC ultimate combo
[7:05:55] dooshken: when we needed ven most, he was eating an apple
[7:06:01] Martem98: idk what more annoying, melee getting kited all day by ranged classes or range getting pummeled by 2 melle
[7:06:04] SteLawBro: Rogues the same way. You see the top champion teams all running rogues so you make one and realize the giant gap between sshuffle and competitive play 😂
[7:06:06] Martem98: melee*
[7:06:06] Hizuru1: you get muted for week
[7:06:08] vmills: then a 3rd warning
[7:06:13] dooshken: haha
[7:06:25] terranapart: LUL
[7:06:35] Hizuru1: Human apple SMOrc
[7:06:38] zachgamegodx: this is history class
[7:06:56] aarongarey1993: Your mog is cool you look like a grey grimreaper
[7:06:57] Noxalis20: oh the cheater not to be names, i am betting his stream going to get hammered tonight lol
[7:07:07] Noxalis20: named
[7:07:08] Martem98: no wlx?
[7:07:10] Hizuru1: HOpe fist teams win
[7:07:22] Thrells: were there any heal priest teams?
[7:07:31] snotiv: i wish you could filter out sod streamers in the section
[7:07:38] Ailith21: @Thrells one, they won the EU cup
[7:07:38] Martem98: hoolibang
[7:07:39] tench000: i loved that Hpriest/WW/sub rogue team, so fun
[7:07:46] Shakertime: yes
[7:07:48] chrisiirc: ye
[7:07:48] Hazythe4Saken: OMG YES@
[7:07:49] snotiv: yes
[7:07:50] dannyboy_81: yep
[7:07:51] timmah25: yes
[7:07:52] Crucaider: Absolutely yes
[7:07:56] dooshken: There should be a separate section for just classic wow in general
[7:07:59] Shakertime: retail and classic need to be split
[7:08:00] Hazythe4Saken: separate classic SoD and retail
[7:08:03] gjvl: WoW viewership is way too low for them to split it
[7:08:04] Hizuru1: No would kill DF streamers even more lel
[7:08:08] Afani89: Do you think Echo has adjusted from last week? And do you expect them to try a new comp?
[7:08:17] carlos199933: Do your ears not hurt with earphones in I wear AirPods for an hour and ears ache @venruki
[7:08:23] vmills: nah you want wows numbers to look up to attract new players
[7:08:24] terranapart: @Hizuru1 This
[7:08:29] Martem98: i lowkey love that mog
[7:08:31] Metaphors: wizard stuf
[7:08:35] atoker: there are separate sections on kick
[7:08:36] neoxue: I'd think have both in the same directory it would boost both in viewership.
[7:08:39] chrisiirc: HUHH
[7:08:40] Garthd: maybe a tag within the cat
[7:08:48] Metaphors: wizards r bad
[7:08:57] Metaphors: wizards need cc
[7:08:59] Metaphors: they nerf cc
[7:09:01] Metaphors: wizard bad
[7:09:08] BrokenEarBank: try wearing earbuds with cauliflower ear lol talk about aching
[7:09:23] zachgamegodx: wizards dont have cc :O
[7:09:24] zachgamegodx: wow
[7:09:26] HazardLaw94: @Afani89 Nah, i think they will just adjust strats. They'll figure out how to progress on what they've been playing
[7:09:36] layzdude85: I was so stoked for season of discovery until I’ve realized all we are getting is revamped abilities we’ve already experienced in past expansions. I have since returned to retail and accepted classic of any form will never truly be the experience it once was.
[7:09:37] crawnpocktail: DH
[7:09:38] crawnpocktail: lol
[7:09:39] gelatokush: cc is not bad the healer trinket nerf to 1.5 min is what changed everything
[7:09:39] Afani89: Hm, yeah. Maybe dh (Raiku) and boomy (Whazz)
[7:09:42] carlos199933: Haha headsets are just comfy haha
[7:09:46] Metaphors: ww monk too
[7:09:50] Hizuru1: W THEM

[7:10:00] Metaphors: yea
[7:10:08] M4dmanGG: I want to se wl sp
[7:10:10] Metaphors: it has just enough cds now that it can rotate with healer
[7:10:12] Metaphors: and perma stay in
[7:10:15] Reminosity: WW is squishiest class cmv
[7:10:15] gelatokush: they should of neever have buff healer cc trinket to 1.5
[7:10:25] terranapart: Rround robin, it's melee season, next season will be caster season
[7:10:39] whitechape1: @venruki do you know if it matters if i have pve set pieces 489 rather than the pvp ones
[7:10:58] whitechape1: for pvp
[7:11:10] whspe: as long as its 489, it dont matter
[7:11:12] Metaphors: assa...ret...and sometimes warrior(not against demo) are the only melee that are killable
[7:11:18] stormya55: which classes counter destro lock?
[7:11:22] whitechape1: yeah cause they already have base stats
[7:11:29] malvarcla: just not true
[7:11:37] marvin1995xo: @Metaphors right feral  is super tanky
[7:11:40] FateIRL: ferals
[7:11:46] FateIRL: dks are killable
[7:11:52] gelatokush: surv
[7:11:52] HazardLaw94: sv hunter are so squish
[7:11:55] zachgamegodx: meta is seeing the magic dragon rn
[7:11:55] Metaphors: into caster
[7:11:57] dooshken: DKs just fall over
[7:11:59] marvin1995xo: hunter can die
[7:12:00] lem_00: dks are squish
[7:12:03] Ailith21: feral is extra squishy, so are dks
[7:12:07] Metaphors: feral wont die into double caster
[7:12:10] Metaphors: dk wont die into double caster
[7:12:18] meepoenjoyer: ya not sure how mm wall got buffed and surv didnt a while back
[7:12:19] Ailith21: weirdly enough warlocks feel pretty squishy a lot of the time too
[7:12:24] zachgamegodx: meta is at odds with what ven wants..he wnats to play a rdruid meta where germination is good
[7:12:26] crispy_creamzz: Hunters need buffed. Or more CC. need to see them in AWC
[7:12:29] xkrytekx: warrior is so awful into caster than what it used to be
[7:12:35] zachgamegodx: and you double rejuv people with 3 stacks of bloom and
[7:12:43] Shakertime: im glad you guys are saying that cause ive been feeding on my dk in ss to the melee lobbies
[7:12:53] zachgamegodx: everyone on the battlefield has 8 hots in metas world
[7:12:58] Metaphors: @zachgamegodx the correct way to play druid not sit back and spam regrowth
[7:13:02] Evoca85: Hope the game gets a big stat squish and removes like 1/3 of abilities from most classes next expansion
[7:13:07] Metaphors: its not metas world
[7:13:11] Metaphors: its correct game design
[7:13:35] Metaphors: the tod to inflate the meter
[7:13:47] 17back: just faces a hpal bot that sat in mid bubbled first global kept trying to to searing glare and died each round lol
[7:14:01] FateIRL: u ever play yulons grace insteead of diffuse? into casters it heals a ton
[7:14:11] chrisiirc: lol  wtf
[7:14:13] Shakertime: ew
[7:14:16] xkrytekx: Searing Glare needs to be removed
[7:14:18] Yaycarrots: danGross
[7:14:18] dooshken: they literally just gave classes abilities back
[7:14:23] xkrytekx: its so annoying
[7:14:41] chrisiirc: the less abilities we have the more botters will be prevalant
[7:14:45] chrisiirc: we dont want that
[7:14:51] dankins92: Good for everyone here not getting sucked into sod phase two hype. Stay strong retailers!
[7:15:02] Evoca85: Some of my classes have 30+ keybinds. It's kinda absurd
[7:15:02] croptopkaren: on MW is yulon's good into aff lock / other rot classes?
[7:15:08] Sovice: We don't need less abilities, we need buttons to stop doing 4 things at the same time
[7:15:11] malvarcla: idk why people act like each class has 10000 abilities, its really not that crazy imo
[7:15:18] Sovice: Everyone is so power crept
[7:15:21] Shakertime: im killing mobs in sod while i wait in queue okay
[7:15:24] zachgamegodx: there's a very high chance ven tries s2 i think
[7:15:25] Martem98: what is SOD? justr like classic?
[7:15:30] zachgamegodx: sodp2
[7:15:45] nikthevoker: uhhh im 28 atm LUL
[7:15:46] Aroty: I honestly don't care about SoD2
[7:15:49] Kymagez: good
[7:15:50] zachgamegodx: that would be good for me
[7:15:51] nikthevoker: keyvan is 31
[7:15:52] Evoca85: If you don't play, I don't play in solidarity
[7:15:56] Martem98: you dont think classes need ability prunes?
[7:15:58] zachgamegodx: but i dunno, u nrealistic to sit here with nothing to do for a week
[7:16:00] crucybletv: i think classic is way overhyped these days SoD or not.
[7:16:04] Garthd: Imagine that LUL
[7:16:06] Shakertime: @Martem98 no
[7:16:39] SteLawBro: Already bored
[7:16:44] Aroty: re-selling an older worse version of the current game with poorly balanced, unexciting runes and class changes :(
[7:16:59] Yaycarrots: mrrRun
[7:17:00] snotiv: fun gameplay
[7:17:02] Shakertime: epic
[7:17:05] SLOOSHXO: CRAWWWLING
[7:17:07] Martem98: @Shakertime doubt any new ppl will get into wow with the ammount of abilities, but idk
[7:17:08] wackpoetic: running OMEGAPOGGERS
[7:17:08] Aroty: And walking everywhere, kill me  now
[7:17:08] Hobblefoot: I wanted to enjoy SOD so much but I just cannot stand going back to older versions of WoW yet again.  Even with the minor tweaks. With that said, I am glad people  are enjoying it.
[7:17:10] Yaycarrots: the classic experience
[7:17:17] Garthd: linking park mashup with whatever this is catJAM
[7:17:27] gelatokush: aint no way im going back to runnign across azeroth
[7:17:34] wackpoetic: if SoD had BG's that were 100% random and didn't allow group queueing, then I'd be all over it
[7:17:37] Aroty: really feels like they are capitalizing on nastalgia that can't ever truly be recaptured
[7:17:51] Garthd: 1.2k gold at level 30 is crazy tho
[7:18:05] Aroty: A lot of my good WoW friends love it, and I'm happy they enjoy it
[7:18:18] Hizuru1: Cant fathom how this is fun looks like work KEKW
[7:18:18] xkayne: @wackpoetic you arent wrong. make a premade option and random option.. just like shuffle
[7:18:31] Hobblefoot: Exactly.  I mean it makes no sense to me but the whole thing is we all play video games to enjoy them. More power to them.
[7:18:35] zachgamegodx: i guess if youre still doing 1.1k viewers like u are rn, can't really argue with the results
[7:18:37] jag_pvp: I can understand why people play it but i dont understand why people want to watch streamers play it
[7:18:48] Lugges48: two different songs at the same time NotLikeThis
[7:18:49] Aroty: when's the tourney
[7:19:04] Hizuru1: true
[7:19:09] dooshken: yea true
[7:19:10] Badasti: here for the chit chat
[7:19:20] neoxue: We're watching you in solo queue while watching SoD
[7:19:20] vmills: true I’m out of here lol
[7:19:21] Hobblefoot: We don't watch for what you play. We watch because it is ... Exactly.
[7:19:22] Badasti: roasting demon hunters
[7:19:22] Thrells: hellyabrother
[7:19:23] xkayne: *noise in the background*
[7:19:25] Badasti: roasting rogues
[7:19:32] Badasti: getting ret palas nerfed
[7:19:35] nikthevoker: hes afk
[7:19:45] Davinciwowx: what you think about solos mode without healer 3v3 DPS only, with option to choose to que 6 dps only or 4 dps + 2 healers mode or both modes
[7:19:47] dropbombsss: 32 already wtfff
[7:19:52] dropbombsss: keyvan is nuts
[7:19:55] morrzn: easiest healer to learn in your opinion?
[7:20:20] Gradyolson1: how is the rogue going?
[7:20:20] Thrells: im not having fun in arena these days. any words of encouragement?
[7:20:24] Steveleeb: ven not on sod what gives?
[7:20:26] Aroty: to be fair, you could easily be doing mythics or grouping for 2's/3's rn and NOT waiting
[7:20:46] Atmosh: Guys, for no particular reason, is jaime competing this season and if so on which team?
[7:20:47] Badasti: @Thrells I suggest playing some Rimworld
[7:20:56] Davinciwowx: what you think about solos mode without healer 3v3 DPS only, with option to choose to que 6 dps only or 4 dps + 2 healers mode or both modes
[7:21:01] Hizuru1: @Atmosh no clue
[7:21:04] Hobblefoot: I hear that Balder's Gate 3 is good. Try that!
[7:21:05] Hizuru1: LUL
[7:21:10] Hizuru1: funny name
[7:21:25] Dopaminex: what’s up ven!
[7:21:27] aarongarey1993: Loving the music 🎶
[7:21:36] Badasti: give them your wind Ven
[7:21:40] Dopaminex: hope you’re having a terrific Thursday my friend 🤠
[7:21:45] Hobblefoot: @Davinciwowx Boy oh boy you want that question answered pretty bad.  :P
[7:21:49] Badasti: they cant handle Vens wind
[7:22:56] Hazythe4Saken: did i just see back peddling?
[7:23:35] Davinciwowx: @Hobblefoot ya i want mode for soloS only with DPS so to reduce ques and ppl start using cds :D because in you dont have healer dmg is not the only answer you need to dig deeper in you spells :D
[7:23:51] Davinciwowx: is win win
[7:23:57] dooshken: 3v3 only dps solo shuffle would be even worse than 2s
[7:24:33] whspe: "elebotter" nice
[7:24:38] Thrells: I want two of these chorus's tattood on me
[7:24:38] Hobblefoot: @Davinciwowx I think it is a great question actually.  I wonder if the worry is that if they make variations of Solo Shuffle it might dilute the player base even more making queue times that much longer.  Just a speculation.
[7:24:40] Thrells: legendary tune
[7:24:48] Davinciwowx: who cars i wana que and they can add mode to choose you want to que for solos with only dps or dps and healers
[7:25:09] pragma90: @Hobblefoot i want a proving ground option with bots in arena to practice
[7:25:50] dooshken: 3v3 dps solo shuffle would be cool as an option but I wouldn't want it to have the same rewards as regular shuffle
[7:25:55] Hizuru1: @pragma90 play the game ,skirmish
[7:25:58] Hobblefoot: @Davinciwowx Ha... I get it. I am the only player in WoW that thinks Tanks should be put back into Solo Shuffle in the "healer" spot to help queue times.  But every time I mention it people hate it.  Haha.  I didn't mind it back before Solo was official.
[7:26:19] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot they dont heal dude
[7:26:33] chezjek: reducing shuffle q times by adding a bunch of low quality lobbies isnt really a solution
[7:26:39] Ailith21: @Hobblefoot tanks are useless lol they get ignored and it just turns into which team has the squishiest dps
[7:26:48] heymomimonttv: the only people who ever say 3v3 dps solo is a good idea have never experienced a 3v3 dps lobby. it's disgusting and people die instantly
[7:26:52] Hobblefoot: @Hizuru1 I am aware. You don't recall prior to Solo being an actual thing (back in Shadowlands) they had that.  I didn't mind at all.
[7:26:59] FateIRL: even prot pally lobbies are troll. round ends in 10 seconds
[7:27:07] crymorre: washed in the sense that you're squeaky clean EZ
[7:27:21] Hobblefoot: See!  I told y'all everyone hates it but me.
[7:27:28] carlos199933: Rdruid diff obviously haha
[7:27:37] Davinciwowx: i think mode with 6 dps or 4 dps and 2 healers and options to choose which mode you want or both
[7:27:52] Hizuru1: @Hobblefoot I dont mind tanks does not matter would be triple dps should allow them as heal lol
[7:28:00] Ailith21: @Davinciwowx 3v3 dps lobbies are not fun lmao
[7:28:27] Davinciwowx: did u try to heal solos on low mmr ? :D
[7:28:32] Badasti: omg
[7:28:33] Davinciwowx: is dps race anyway
[7:28:40] rembrandt89: devastation is ridiculous
[7:28:40] Hizuru1: Pog
[7:28:47] Badasti: that healer felt Vens wind
[7:28:48] Zuterloo: 150k dps devo
[7:28:52] Xeliumimar: im not a fan of how dampening works in shuffle
[7:28:52] Ailith21: is dev sleeper op in shuffle?
[7:28:54] figurines: dps should Q in duos. healer solo. matched up on 3s ladder. thers a forum post about this
[7:28:56] ihavesmokedcrack: Cheer100 wish i got solo ques
[7:29:17] Ailith21: @Xeliumimar makes sense that it scales faster, no one wants to play 6 10 minute rounds lol
[7:29:21] nikthevoker: 430k still my highest :(
[7:29:31] dooshken: quez
[7:29:44] Davinciwowx: i have 3 healers and que insta but on my dps i wait 20 min avr
[7:30:02] Davinciwowx: so i prefer to play with only dps instead of waiting
[7:31:41] waelrick: monk kick range is so cringe
[7:31:52] Badasti: you bring his ass a win
[7:31:55] Badasti: I believe
[7:32:04] rembrandt89: nullify is so annoying to deal with as monk
[7:32:26] ThePdfreak: i swear after playing with 8 yrd range meele range feels so bad
[7:33:46] Xeliumimar: i wish there was a version of 3s, where its just double caster vs double caster. thats the game i want to play
