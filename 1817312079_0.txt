[0:15:03] ph4nt0mchow: im banned from valorant I need to play something else
[0:15:05] foxbait7: Gosh, if wow allowed for an audio narrative that you could have rolling as you quested would be awesome.
[0:15:07] Salam199: im wanting to play some wow, but im stuck on wether to play retail or classic
[0:15:15] Insta_Coffee: Why priest over Druid? lookin heals or?

[0:15:46] slightlyexpiredmilk: First started playing classic when trying HC the fact that leveling is fun has me addicted
[0:15:47] forexpatty: Shroud what would you rate New World
[0:15:48] Grimm_Spectre: @Insta_Coffee probably to divide the loot
[0:15:53] ThatShakboii: what are you meaning for trio? are you trying to do all leveling/dungeosn with just 3 people?
[0:15:54] ogMansoN: if you die while raiding in HC you lose your charecter right
[0:16:01] horeacio: i only played on WoW game and the intro had too many cutscenes, my friends and I were falling asleep
[0:16:08] Ty0o7: @shroud so if someone griefs a dungeon run do you get to appeal it and rerun the dungeon?
[0:16:08] spietato92: rate dark and darker
[0:16:13] marionick7: What do you think about mod where you lose your loot when u die but you keep the character
[0:16:27] Scottyy901: will you be on d4 server slam this weekend?
[0:16:27] undefeated888: yess shroud keep yourself fit my hero mwah
[0:16:28] KrAzY23Man: @ph4nt0mchow aerials system of a down
[0:16:34] madaqifa: Hi
[0:16:35] 3ab00d: do you think WOW is worth it for a new player ?!
[0:16:37] grovertonn: I’d priest for y’all - priest main in wow classic
[0:16:39] No1_Loser: 4
[0:16:41] user_nate: It could be way better though
[0:16:49] Breakk: the intial leveling in new world is so fun
[0:16:49] forexpatty: True, pretty hard to top wow
[0:16:54] Ty0o7: the prox chat is neat
[0:17:01] Mathlete16: true. are you still playing OSRS?
[0:17:21] ThatShakboii: what are you meaning for trio? are you trying to do all leveling/dungeosn with just 3 people? 󠀀
[0:17:36] call_me_fig: from appeals i've seen there's a big onus on the player to vet dungeon party members so unlikely to appeal a death from a dungeon griefer
[0:17:41] Pagemaster41: I stopped my vertical progression to work on professions, now my warrior has a solid set of gear
[0:17:43] cujo8181: Lol new world
[0:17:46] aquillees: What song is this chat??

[0:18:07] JBeardoh: if everytime you died you started over. Please make that mmo
[0:18:11] react234: world pvp
[0:18:15] ph4nt0mchow: Is there any mmo with exclusive/special classes which only a few players can obtain, I just want to take part in the grind if it was possible
[0:18:19] JimmysRevenge: this pendulum?
[0:18:22] ChubbyMikey: Honestly I think new world is an amazing game, but it needs to mature. It's still young
[0:18:23] JimmysRevenge: nice
[0:18:25] beibitzh: pidorAZ
[0:18:26] JerseyBricklayer: new world is tryin g to be great despite its devs best efforts
[0:18:27] Nixal_: new world was designed as survival game, like max 5 players near you ever
[0:18:29] spietato92: @JBeardoh never last tarkov and a few games like it

[0:18:37] GT3_Xample: When game?
[0:18:39] TrongJoshiiiii: shroud200IQ_TK
[0:18:40] Pagemaster41: I spent way to much in game coin on new world to make a solid PvP set, its not where I want it, but atleast I look sick
[0:18:44] JBeardoh: it adds the same fear as in dayz/tarkov. would be AWESOME
[0:18:44] beibitzh: condom
[0:18:56] Demias2: @shroud what about the old school version of you dont delete your char but you lose your stuff so world pvp is still good and high stakes
[0:18:56] slightlyexpiredmilk: HC makes an MMO so much more exciting
[0:19:04] call_me_fig: i think new world needed to be more company focused and less faction focused
[0:19:15] iiiTzMikey: @shroud Have you played lich king?
[0:19:25] JerseyBricklayer: @Nixal_ we rolled with like 25 plus people in the alphas. had open world fights with everyone on one server. ran better than now LUL
[0:19:35] Breakk: do you want full drop on death to come back in games?
[0:19:35] WickedmageX: ill priest you daddy shroudy
[0:19:39] ThatShakboii: What's priest for trio about?
[0:19:46] NanaCanPlay: shroud im a priest player in HC   i made it to the rfc tourney and did great
[0:19:55] Nixal_: @Nixal_ alpha was good times, leveled up 3 times
[0:19:59] clancylegit: i mean i would love new world hc
[0:20:00] ItsLegend_Live: hi shrood i can priest
[0:20:05] Demias2: NOT FULL DROP but partial drop like runescape
[0:20:06] NanaCanPlay: id love to be your partner and im a guildie
[0:20:07] cujo8181: Old republic mmo tho… when’s that getting remastered
[0:20:09] user_nate: I think with some pvp areas it would be nice
[0:20:09] tricky_turtle: @aquillees pendulum - watercolour
[0:20:11] Doite_Gaming: Wait.. What? I'm confused. I've been away for a while and when I left Shoud always had 20k viewers and now 2k? What happened? Whats the plan?
[0:20:16] MrDocTyr: WHat lvl are you lookin for on the priest @shroud ??
[0:20:18] JerseyBricklayer: i miss last oasis still, that game was a banger
[0:20:20] cookiemilkdunker87: full loot pvp is fun
[0:20:20] user_nate: osrs pking back in the day was lit
[0:20:24] nosmile_kyle: Ultima Online was kinda like that in the beginning I believe
[0:20:25] EXlZE: HeyGuys
[0:20:28] rohithprime: Play valorant
[0:20:30] kingssj5ttv: should try ablion online kinda neat
[0:20:31] blucap_: @Doite_Gaming are you 12?
[0:20:31] dreggi: i mean people stream dayz and eve online. those are full drop
[0:20:41] aceassination: @Doite_Gaming he's been live for 20 min?
[0:20:43] Pagemaster41: certain zones or areas with full loot drop would kind of be cool, but PvP /combat is not balanced at all. Theres a reason why everyone is light load and just runs away and dodges in open world pvp .
[0:20:44] snatch203: watch youngmen27 on twicht insane onepiece opening
[0:20:47] onesa1nt: @Doite_Gaming he just started the stream bozo
[0:20:47] ph4nt0mchow: have you ever tried fable?
[0:20:53] gojiburr: huge vrising update in 6 days
[0:21:01] Grimm_Spectre: if you have enough time a Full drop on death wouldnt be bad as long as you had backup gear.

[0:39:59] Curtsy: @monkeyking_69 People are doing HC with an addon now, it's extremely popullar right now
[0:40:04] Mavrek93: everyone running the exact same gear set is boring though
[0:40:06] GameHova94: oh ok farming low level for easy xp
[0:40:16] BOXscoreBEAST: !level
[0:40:23] Xtaro: Tiers have to be powerful enough to break the previous tier bonuses... It was lame wearing t2 in Naxx for so long waiting for a 4th t3
[0:40:26] Fungdork: blizzard should have released classic with patch progression. kids today should have had to deal with old specs and no spell power etc on gear
[0:40:28] kalish_: What does hardcore mean in classic? You die you lose everything?
[0:40:30] rato_de_esgoto88: @Mavrek93 everyone already runs the exact same gear set their addon tells is bis, whats the difference
[0:40:31] LCTR_: @monkeyking_69 one life, no trading before 60, only run dungeons once, etc
[0:40:34] krispplayz: This playlist is giving me a solid hit of nostalgia
[0:40:35] CurrentzTM: @shroud I have mained a priest multiple times on classic. Went deathless on SoM and got Survivor of the Firelord. Also with Nef and Cthuun. Lemme know if the priest spot isnt filled yet. Im in your guild on wrath classic "Hero"
[0:40:53] monkeyking_69: ok thanks. brb. paying blizzard now
[0:40:59] GameHova94: my bad i know nothing of wow but will watch shroud play anything lol
[0:41:25] Black8Angel: black84BlackoHi black84BlackoHi black84BlackoHi
[0:41:27] Curtsy: @Fungdork It's a good thing Blizzard doesn't listen to people like you honestly, patch wave progression would be fucking awful
[0:41:36] Fungdork: it would be better by far
[0:41:36] PaxedUP: Right now? Hold on I'll make a priest
[0:41:40] ilpss: how about /who priest barrens @shroud
[0:41:48] doctorweeevil: What server is shroud playing on?
[0:41:59] savealot2: arent you only allowed to do each dungeon once? wont that make finding a priest alot harder?
[0:42:14] Curtsy: No there isnt, not even private servers do that, literally nobody wants that

[0:42:34] 7Berzerk: greenday Pog
[0:42:39] elimud: yeah theres a reason the private servers that were popular ran the later patches lol
[0:42:39] Holski77: I want to do all the Rextroy exploits though cmonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
[0:42:40] Fungdork: 90% of what made classic mostly bad is that everything was released without the balance it was released with
[0:42:41] Brenkan: !ui
[0:42:44] 7Berzerk: you fuck with green day shroudy?
[0:42:50] Royaxus: The only thing i dont like about classic is how some classes work, i love the rogue in retail, but i hate playing rogue in classic combo points suck in classic tho
[0:42:58] smungleses: Great I’ll take this report by you to some developer of the sqadron
[0:42:58] triplezro: retail when
[0:43:00] PaxedUP: @jaalexba and AOL timecards
[0:43:01] mister_ble: no one carries flip phones for nastalgia, theres only so much backwards people will accept
[0:43:14] saosin0: is shroud ever gonna leave barrens
[0:43:17] MastaKlutch: Damn im playing a rogue in classic rn first play through to 60 @Royaxus
[0:43:26] Pr0phetic: imagine playing with 1.1 talents LUL

[0:43:51] Mikeriino: Shroud you playing on na?
[0:43:53] Fungdork: doing MC with the gear designed to start doing MC is way better than doing MC with gearing designed around catching up to Naxx faster

[0:45:01] MastaKlutch: MANY MEN\
[0:45:02] Royaxus: @mastaklutch i dont like it how restricted you are with classic combo points. stacking CP then HAVE to interrupt somethings else-> lost CP and your dmg gg lol

[0:45:18] rato_de_esgoto88: judd died again?
[0:45:21] Fungdork: the gear you initially did MC with was without spellpower and stuff, you went in with full tier 0 with the only spell power being the set bonuses
[0:45:24] walleyedtuna: songs a banger lol

[0:45:56] aerodynam1c: gz
[0:45:59] Fungdork: idk about people being better at the game, though. I think that's false
[0:46:11] augaliciouss: people are SO much better at the game
[0:46:12] Curtsy: @Fungdork Okay you're just trolling now OMEGALUL
[0:46:13] gojiburr: 1 guyed PepeLaugh

[0:46:31] kaiba1738: @Fungdork did you do MC back in the day? People are WAY better
[0:46:31] violenthugger: Alot
[0:46:32] nickeaoe: wait did he actually fkn finally get a wand i fell asleep yday
[0:46:32] hypes_jr: @Moderator ban gantur because he is scammer
[0:46:35] Fungdork: yes I did
[0:46:36] mister_ble: imp drain is a must
[0:46:45] Fungdork: they really aren't
[0:46:47] hypes_jr: Ban gantru03
[0:46:49] Curtsy: They don't have a point, they said that people aren't better at the game now, they're just trolling us
[0:47:02] General_Kenobiii: Dance PepoDance Dance
[0:47:05] Royaxus: @mastaklutch yeah pvp is fine. Doesnt feel as bad there, but PVE sucks especially AoR scenarios.
[0:47:11] Royaxus: Aoe*
[0:47:16] Curtsy: People are 100% better now than they were back in the day, saying anything otherwise is just lying to try and prove a point
[0:47:27] raffles187: Not that smart, he's playing DayZ lol
[0:47:32] RedUnd34d: not starting on 1.12 itemization was great on PServers. U had more gearprogression
[0:47:32] Fungdork: you can't even saypeople are better because there is no 1:1 way to compare because we've only ever had latest balance / gearing with classic
[0:47:33] cryptori: EZ
[0:47:38] 7Berzerk: you're set for life. I like watching u play wow tho
[0:47:39] mister_ble: 60 sec ranged poison, ouch
[0:47:40] Cenwigf: once CS2 comes out out for everyone the bounce back is going to be huge
[0:47:42] Fungdork: it's just an assumption with no evidence
[0:47:46] Curtsy: @Fungdork KEKW keep these coming
[0:47:47] Iam_StoneK: Ill watch you play WoW forever
[0:47:49] neiloftw: It's not only the players that are better, also the computers and internet connections are million times better then it was back when MC was just released.
[0:47:49] wavecadet: im not an FPS viwer much but love when you stream WoW
[0:47:55] kiraqb: shroudHype
[0:48:02] slightlyexpiredmilk: @wavecadet same
[0:48:08] Holski77: The longer you avoid an FPS, the more people will watch you when you return, which is probably not something a lot of other streamers could say.
[0:48:15] ChieveMoe: @Fungdork I respect your opinion outlook on your idea man. I wouldn't want it but at least you voice it
[0:48:19] slimskeezy13: I feel like wow is still a pretty big game too tho so to see you in that space has gotta get wow people excited
[0:48:20] Grimm_Spectre: probably 1/2 your viewers watching arent your regulars xD
[0:48:22] XEeveeX: FeelsStrongMan wow classic Clap
[0:48:22] slimskeezy13: or at least curious
[0:48:25] pffq: is WoW a third person shooter?
[0:48:25] haxxBase: would you even need to stream?
[0:48:26] smungleses: Makes sense
[0:48:26] BluelightCT: KEKW
[0:48:27] slightlyexpiredmilk: I think HC reaches a broader audience then regular classic
[0:48:29] kaiba1738: @Fungdork Back in vanilla, no matter what group of MC I did, half the raid is doing something wrong. I can do a PUG MC and expect no mistakes
[0:48:30] digitalpanhandlr: LUL
[0:48:33] BluelightCT: YEP
[0:48:34] Owera22: @Fungdork come on, its obvious ppl are better, and with all the guides, ppl are better
[0:48:39] nickeaoe: only here bcus of wow tbh
[0:48:40] BluelightCT: I'm back EZ
[0:48:44] smit0r: Crazy to me they are actually adding a "Support" spec to freaking retail. Interested to see how that messes with the balance. I love the idea of supports in MMOs, but not wow.
[0:48:45] Fungdork: @kaiba1738 this isn't true
[0:48:49] SayomiToki: EZ
[0:48:51] 7Berzerk: you thought u were going towards ninja's step? LUL
[0:48:51] gojiburr: :)
[0:49:04] smit0r: Yes
[0:49:05] Scottyy901: my grandfather told me about elvis presley, my father told me about michael jackson, i will tell my kids about shroud
[0:49:07] TheQuimbly: Yeah, truth be told, most people don't wanna watch this game anymore
[0:49:08] Fungdork: @Owera22 the floor may be higher because of those guides, but those at the top aren't
[0:49:09] nickpopovsky: hey shroud have you realised that the reason you are getting back to this game is because most of the new games are soulless?

[0:49:24] PaxedUP: viewership < self-worth
[0:49:26] ChieveMoe: Its impossible for you to stay down Shroud lol. Exactly how you put it going into a FPS would just raise the viewers time and time again for however long you stream for
[0:49:27] MangoPickle: pepeJAM
[0:49:30] haxxBase: @Scottyy901 shroud cant sing LUL
[0:49:30] rato_de_esgoto88: I mean in retail its way better?
[0:49:32] Fungdork: kiled Rag in march 2005, sorry
[0:49:42] smungleses: There’s many ways and conception we can see this
[0:49:42] mi5t3rph15t3r: @nickpopovsky Sadly this, I always come back to Wow and FFXIV, most of the rest are just painful to play.\
[0:49:42] smit0r: A real "Enhancement" sounds sick.
[0:49:50] hydrobeam_: what would classic+ be? like them redo classic and relaunch?

[0:50:12] BobbyFlay253: is there a certain server people are playing for HC classic?
[0:50:16] Curtsy: The new evoker spec is still a damage dealer by the way, it just supports too
[0:50:16] Koenig_: but windfury slaps anyway :DDD
[0:50:19] kaiba1738: @Fungdork Nah cuz if you did you would not be spouting this stuff lol. I dont know a single person who has played both who thinks like you lol

[0:50:34] Rain101v: Afternoon brother 🙏❤️🙏 n chat <3 <3 <3
[0:50:45] frizzletoothy: HARDCORE MODE
[0:50:48] Fungdork: 8 debuff slots, every rogue using barman shanker, these things were what the game was balanced around at the time
[0:50:49] Trekka: oh shit the "kid" comeback lmaop
[0:50:49] rato_de_esgoto88: Once you get +shadow dmg your drain life will scale big @shroud

[0:51:22] Fungdork: but they aren't better that's a false statement
[0:51:30] Fungdork: again, the floor is a bit higher perhaps
[0:51:34] Curtsy: @Fungdork KEKW
[0:51:38] Fungdork: but the top end is really the same as it ever was talent wise

[0:52:25] onlytroll69: can u tweet before the premier match
[0:52:28] Curtsy: This guy is contradicting himself in one sentence
[0:52:30] Vandernesh: i thought they removed that? or was that just for season of mastery?
[0:52:31] Fungdork: it's fine to say the debuff cap is dumb but it's how those fights were balanced so it's hard to just say remove it
[0:52:46] Owera22: @Fungdork ah sorry didnt know you had all the stats of players in front of you
[0:52:48] deuselk: theres a debuff cap on bosses?...
[0:53:05] lu3nox: @deuselk its classic mate
[0:53:11] Fungdork: in early vanilla it was 8
[0:53:17] michigawa1: hardcore with questie x) thats not hc
[0:53:20] Fungdork: then upped to 16 because of Vael / mind vision

[0:54:59] Steakslive: open so many spec
[0:55:04] Fungdork: it's not that it's a good thing or a bad thing, it's how the fights then were designed and balanced so it should have been that way again, otherwise it's a completely different thing

[0:55:35] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[0:55:37] kaiba1738: the solution is just increase the health of boss a little, then remove the cap
[0:55:45] Owera22: defintely a bad thing 100%
[0:55:47] Fungdork: @Fungdork balance in video games doesn't mean even or fair
[0:56:01] GhostDealer250: Fung just give up lol
[0:56:07] smungleses: Like the tiers of your own balance then what the actual value is

[1:00:48] Fungdork: classic + is mostly finishing the unfinished / proposed ideas from then, like an emerald dream raid and stuff. kind of going back to the original idea of WoW which was to have no expansions and to just continue doing patches... though they dropped that idea before the game even released

[5:55:29] lier2525: NODDERS
[5:55:54] bco71: did anything happen to the trio?
[5:56:07] ChubbyMikey: no, just no justin playing
[5:56:12] tat0t: stats on staff?
[5:56:19] EvilBuho: I am calling it now, but I bet you if they die is going to be to a totem pulling an elite.
[5:56:30] LordGrimmothy: Why everyone playing hc all of a sudden?
[5:56:33] GrannyApple: did they nerf barbarian?
[5:56:36] GaktuS: druid companions got omegabuffed as well
[5:56:40] BlastedNips: There was so much backlash against druid because it was so underwhelming in just the first 25 levels. Insane.
[5:56:43] shlappyz: balancing early levels doesn't seem that crazy
[5:56:57] Smoquito: @EvilBuho cause its really fun actually
[5:57:02] orcisporkis: I am so mad about DK nerfs
[5:57:10] donimusprime1817: leveling should be fun and leveling druid was terrible
[5:57:11] BlastedNips: To be fair, they could at least make it more fun in those first 25. I had a terrible time with it.
[5:57:13] xhairbait: they could be related to progression OP
[5:57:29] ChubbyMikey: Well, I don't know that it was a mistake. Hard to tell without playing the changes
[5:57:31] searle_: they were doing endgame beta at the same time and maybe they saw something that needed to be changed
[5:57:43] xhairbait: bliz always over designs
[5:58:04] DrCrusherOohLaLa: yeah the leveling is always enjoyable
[5:58:04] BlastedNips: I mean a terrible time with druid specifically.
[5:58:08] xXyze: Which weapon enh you using shroudy
[5:58:10] BlastedNips: I had a great time with the others haha.
[5:58:22] wessywes: i switched priest to rogue same reason
[5:58:22] GaktuS: my earth druid fucking slapped
[5:58:23] ChubbyMikey: I adored my barbarian
[5:58:25] ShaneyYBRO: Shroud to join team liquid for tier 3, heard it here first 👀
[5:58:26] DrCrusherOohLaLa: druid was the only one i enjoyed because it wasn't faceroll everything

[5:58:41] Tebone7: touring taurens
[5:58:42] EvilBuho: Interesting @skigrit , I had a ton of fun with Druid. But I was playing with my fiance who was a mage so
[5:59:07] xXyze: ARe you usin flametongue?
[5:59:08] Seeyuhlaterrr: How dare you attack the valiant dwarves of the alliance!!
[5:59:16] BlastedNips: Agreed.
[5:59:26] ChubbyMikey: I didn't like mage or necro at all
[5:59:49] Azurehax: rogue was my favorite
[6:00:08] DrCrusherOohLaLa: necro was a'ight but sorc felt awful to me. like every spell was just overpowered
[6:00:11] GaktuS: I wonder how good companions will feel after the buffs
[6:00:24] EvilBuho: When I ran druid, I built it very tanky
[6:00:31] BlastedNips: I'll give it another go on release. I wanted to enjoy it because it's just different at least. With Sorc, done it all before. Necro? Same. Barb? Yep. Druid and rogue were the only ones that brought something somewhat new for me.
[6:00:32] Azurehax: definitely going rogue main at the start
[6:00:51] Kikkadoom: Earth druid was the only good beta one and thats kinda what made me dislike it. Played storm and can see how late game it will be good but wasnt in the beta.
[6:00:55] BlastedNips: I mean when I was playing Necro I felt like I was just playing necro in D2.
[6:01:03] ChubbyMikey: I liked my barb because it requied active engagement and positioning. I had to pull, group them up, proc my buffs and synergies, then fucking destroy everything in front of me
[6:01:27] BlastedNips: Yeah it was just lightning that was massively strong.
[6:01:39] Dox023: Hydra was strong
[6:01:41] hazey0000: chat be essaying fr
[6:01:43] BlastedNips: And yeah @ChubbyMikey barb is actual work, which I enjoy.
[6:01:48] dragoniteslays: The hydra was op
[6:01:49] abdoushr77: Which suspension is this guys??
[6:01:52] GaktuS: the fact that rogue twisting blades CDR mastery was nerfed kinda sucks for my plan, but rogue was still my fav
[6:02:05] abdoushr77: And what s max level here??
[6:02:12] fergfurg: 38
[6:02:15] MCSwagdooodle: Is there a pool or bet going to see when/if shroud dies at a specific level?

[6:02:34] ChubbyMikey: @skigrit Agreed. I like knowing I won the fight by building well then playing well, and not because the base abilities are so op that I could have AFK'd it

[6:03:00] abdoushr77: Whats max lvl here guyss??
[6:03:02] BlastedNips: Yup. The lightning sorc build and some of the necro builds were so strong, at least at that world tier.
[6:03:07] vDaishar: Surely nothing can go wrong :)
[6:03:09] BlastedNips: Made it less fun for me.
[6:03:13] chandleriab: D4 is free for the weekend right?

[6:16:22] JerseyBricklayer: whgatd i do now
[6:16:23] Shiftyloid: @Kas50 i mean why they dont play with J9 anymore. I thought that they play duo only while waiting for him but now i think that J9 just quit or smt so i asked about it
[6:16:28] falka12: whats this song
[6:16:32] ChubbyMikey: @triplezro he's like a 7k andy in NW and that's just after launch
[6:16:33] BlastedNips: I'm really excited for Pax Dei but I'm also prepared to be disappointed. You gotta temper your expectations significantly with games these days, especially MMOs.
[6:16:34] Nautt1: Riot has a decent history of making space, it's mmo might just be equal to wow

[6:16:59] Warpiercer: I love how the only knowledge we have of Riot mmo is their director and principle game designer left the company bruh
[6:17:01] im_ur_dad101: look at summit
[6:17:10] Iolumadbro: Pog
[6:17:15] btbamfan3: @skigrit thats the reason they made a duo account. hes flakey and shroud/ska want to play

[6:17:23] osrsautist0: can anyone tell me what happened to the HC trio with J9?
[6:17:23] Kas50: @Shiftyloid dude relax, Justin will play the game when he plays the game, just because it's not conveinitent for him for a few days doesn't mean he quit WoW etc LUL
[6:17:28] SpikeDeagle: you can get 60k playing csgo ez
[6:17:28] partytown: balancing whats popular vs what you like
[6:17:35] Dovashh: @shroud wow is an FPS retirement game
[6:17:36] Justanyo: i go backwards when i don't want to get dazed
[6:17:40] RapsterDJ: could pull an asmon and just fuck off the main channel for a bit
[6:17:40] pyroflexin: @spikedeagle no ty
[6:17:41] WhatTheFrogDoing: have you thought about not letting yourself see your view count?
[6:17:43] flashnickgg: NOTED
[6:17:44] Leemster30: it's a measurement of success in most peoples eyes, and it can be hard to see it another way.
[6:17:46] Plaag_Beest: most important thing to do is play stuff you enjoy, the mental struggle with stuff u dont enjoy is worse then about numbers
[6:17:52] onlyogawa: COCKA
[6:17:53] Shiftyloid: @mrderolas i think people bored of retail and wrath classic so they try to play hc
[6:17:54] Dalsonson: Its the idea of "why work at a job if you're contempt if you could get a better paying job" I get it
[6:17:59] floundah: Nobody wants to go backwards says the guy listening to nu metal playing vanilla wow. But that said I’m jealous lol
[6:17:59] loljss: I feel like you kind of transcend that though

[6:19:01] grca12: Would you rebrand for MMO's?
[6:19:03] stonerzebra: well what's worse mentally? continuing to play a game you hate in hopes your channel keeps growing? or play a game you truly enjoy and lose some viewership?
[6:19:04] ChubbyMikey: @JerseyBricklayer nerd
[6:19:06] AdamL2727: Did he pay for RestedXP or pirate it? Lol ;)
[6:19:07] nellypog: just do it

[6:19:11] JerseyBricklayer: do it long enough and maybe u will @shroud
[6:19:12] BlastedNips: Well, blowing up more than usual.
[6:19:13] xdc1: @shroud  is this your downtime so when csgo 2 comes out.. you can hit it hard
[6:19:19] ndeeed: ESO is a great game
[6:19:20] Alias2552: Do you prefer csgo (tac shooters) or faster pace BRs these days shroud?

[6:19:35] BlastedNips: Asmon just thinks that way about doing nothing but react content for his YouTube, haha.
[6:19:39] ChubbyMikey: @DoomedTacox most likely not
[6:19:40] Triqqy_: could be grass is greener, odablack likes to play valo
[6:19:42] flashnickgg: asmon playing turn base anime now @shroud KEKW

[6:20:02] combopoints: The thing about MMOs is that you can so immersed. I can grind out an MMO all day but playing competitive fps drains you.
[6:20:02] HandyRandy93: How is Gray man, wish I could join the server lol
[6:20:10] read_art42: to be honest u balenced it out for me somtimes
[6:20:10] Collectormat: I love Swotr

[6:20:12] violenthugger: Whatttt
[6:20:13] ChalupaCabra_x: never watched someone play WoW but I thoroughly enjoy when you do
[6:20:14] Nebulae3: Asmon got a new Pc now with 4090 gpu - so he is going to dive into Jedi :)
[6:20:21] MuenCheese: SWTOR is good fun
[6:20:22] kekailani_: Sorcerer?
[6:20:22] violenthugger: Swotr is sick
[6:20:28] Nautt1: can an shooter-fps-mmo exist where you have to click heads, but its like wow
[6:20:32] cybersilica: how does your hc guide go over 20? thought it was in pre order
[6:20:34] Stanlec: emulating is only the way I can stand to play switch games...
[6:20:34] BlastedNips: I had a fantastic time playing a powertech bounty hunter when SWTOR first came out.
[6:20:34] Nautt1: does any exist?
[6:20:35] mrderolas: what server do people play hardcroes on
[6:20:38] iwearnike: inquisitor is a thing
[6:20:39] ChubbyMikey: @JerseyBricklayer I rewatched Asmons Diablo 4 Barb playthrough, and it's amazing how bad he was at it
[6:20:40] Jaskaran158: Yup
[6:20:42] read_art42: but meybe im just the clown target gruop KEKW
[6:20:44] MlghtySheep: u ever played 'beyond all reason'?

[6:20:45] Jaskaran158: Fishing OP
[6:20:52] KoalaTheAwesome: @shroud  will u play diablo 4?
[6:20:55] samiwamiAEYOE: Did you play Silkroad? @shroud
[6:20:56] Jaskaran158: Gonna fish up a green that's gonna be bis PepeLaugh
[6:20:58] Kas50: @shroud You have a good number of followers and people love you in general, IF you went full time MMO - you would get a mix of old and new viewers but you'd absolutely be big in any field you chose <3
[6:21:01] Warpiercer: Fishing is somewhat a good gold making way?
[6:21:04] ChubbyMikey: @KoalaTheAwesome he will. A lot.
[6:21:12] zbatindabutt: FPS games are so stressful and we're getting old BibleThump
[6:21:12] MlghtySheep: no money in mmo
[6:21:14] btbamfan3: this T Pain ad is one of the few i dont mind watching all the way
[6:21:25] Jaskaran158: Pretty sure there is a chance
[6:21:25] brodycanuck: @MlghtySheep There is for the top guys
[6:21:27] slaktar: the grass is always greener, enjoy the variety when you feel like it
[6:21:58] ChubbyMikey: I think you should try to do more collabs with asmon, you might be able to bring some of his viewers over to you. But you'd have to talk a LOT more to keep them
[6:21:58] BlastedNips: So the grand takeaway is that shroud will be alternating FPS games/MMOs/hot tub streams to keep a nice balance of content and viewers.
[6:22:01] Jaskaran158: You will get a trunk eventually
[6:22:09] Shiftyloid: @Kas50 im not judging J9 or anything. Im just asking why. Maybe Shroud said about it something. Maybe there is a reason or something like that. You taking it too far man
[6:22:11] Nautt1: whens your bday

[6:22:50] RevansMask: I have been staying away from all the betas I want to be as fresh as possible for when the game launches in don't want to get burnt out early
[6:22:51] Warpiercer: MMO streams can be very cozy and chill, having topics to talk with your chat, grind, probably the community is doing the same thing, thus making the stream relatable imho. Something competitive FPS games miss
[6:22:53] Krait06: Im june 1st lol
[6:22:54] account3cryptogonztyamzn: you only need the sound to win at fishing
[6:22:55] ChubbyMikey: I won't fish in any game

[6:23:14] account3cryptogonztyamzn: i got to 450 fishing in WOTLK
[6:23:21] zbatindabutt: @MlghtySheep fps games require strats and outsmarting opponents
[6:23:27] Nautt1: @Azurehax hes shroud, he doesnt get a queue. stremer privileges
[6:23:30] mrderolas: @RippedLotus on the wotlk or vanilla client?
[6:23:34] WhatTheFrogDoing: man i got max fishing in every retaul xpac
[6:23:45] MlghtySheep: grinding in new world is unrewarding

[6:25:33] flashnickgg: @bengalbroys watching gorgc playing dota 2 while trolling in chat is good stress relieve maybe try it KEKW
[6:25:52] Jaskaran158: I didnt enjoy rested xp it made the leveling too linear almost. Personally leveling without it is slower but more fun to set put your own questing path

[6:39:02] eat_gate_now: shroudDab
[6:39:10] account3cryptogonztyamzn: I personally think that the fastest way is probably just not having ADHD and following quests logically. When the quests are not hitting you move location, just try to be efficient and you'll do great

[6:57:04] mrderolas: is trading and ah enabled at level 60? im really intrigued in the game mode but if you are supposed to craft your own gear, a lot of gear takes stuff from other people
