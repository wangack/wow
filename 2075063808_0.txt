[0:17:34] Cadwgan: 10 years of horizontal development and "we need to get this out now"
[0:17:35] ccrossy98: The game was in serious development hell for like 10 years or so, started as a completely different game @preachlfw it definitely shows
[0:17:42] TheLawfulGeek: Problem is Luna is not much of a character, so when she dies it's like "Oh, whatever"

[0:28:55] majkos: @Hunter_GS well, depends how much are you bothered that someone you dont know and care about gets a bit of loot :P
[0:28:58] yuiona: ah ok lol
[0:28:59] Stawnchy: How can you remove a world boss from LFG... If you remove the prompt on the WQ you just create your own..
[0:28:59] OspreyRed: @yuiona basic, straightforward dps check

[0:29:24] yuiona: thanks everyone for the answer :D
[0:29:40] Hunter_GS: @majkos its not about that, you can not give a shit about it, but then the gear curve gets throw out the window when everybody can get "complex group content" level of gear with just random tagging
[0:29:43] lilipat27: crab boss?

[0:30:05] Lctl10: @Hunter_GS  then make world bosses about cosmetics and Mounts. There.
[0:30:12] daris888: the trolls
[0:30:14] TheFuriyon: council of elders @preachlfw
[0:30:26] Hunter_GS: @Lctl10 no guild will care about them then
[0:30:30] GoobleGamingTV: Good Morning Hansel and Gretel fans!
[0:30:34] MrCosines: Council bosses typically just put the spotlight on specs that normally don't stand out on single target. I think that's why it's good to include one.
[0:30:37] DespairInShadows: PepeLaugh
[0:30:43] 3rayed: PepeLaugh

[0:31:10] Hunter_GS: @Lctl10 i get that but we are talking about loot and power content here for guilds to tackle
[0:31:14] viczz88: Streamer validated PepeLmao

[0:31:51] Stawnchy: Hard agree
[0:31:56] Lctl10: @Hunter_GS you underestimate individual guild members desire to do hardcontent and cosmetics.
[0:31:57] majkos: @Hunter_GS I see your point but that is exaggeration, we talking about 1-2 chances per week on world bosses not a tag farm ;]
[0:32:16] EeraGames: Mr Fatboss? Pog

[0:32:35] Hunter_GS: @majkos in a case like this the meta would be to have 10 characters and tag them when a guild does it with every character you have
[0:32:36] Allessii: My guild stopped at M Tindral because we knew its though as hell and gear didnt make it any easer
[0:32:36] yuiona: but wasnt it always like that?

[0:32:58] DzikiWegorz1223: I think this made me quit playing WoW regularly

[0:33:21] hiraikou: Corpa Clap
[0:33:31] Lctl10: @yuiona Sort of. Vanilla gear was amazingly good at high tiers and made a huge difference
[0:33:38] EeraGames: @Katjix622 The update is mostly adding in nicer things like metal that looks metallic etc, rather than overall changing the style of it. So if you don't like it now, probably won't won't change with the update.
[0:33:44] Rhekkar: KEKW fools that part with their money
[0:34:00] Dunkingsonn: Legion?

[0:34:16] Sup1212: WoD?

[0:34:20] Stawnchy: M+ really drove it home
[0:34:21] Katjix622: @EeraGames been playing teh game for 13K hours lol but yeah was curious saw alot of people saying it sucks.
[0:34:25] EeraGames: FF14 Raiding, kill last boss, kill it 7 more times over the next 2 months and then go do something else
[0:34:28] EazzyBreezzy: prob since intro of M+ surely
[0:34:28] Shelana95: Nighthold for the trinkets !!
[0:34:31] Shelana95: why
[0:34:32] gilbertron: youd have to obliterate loot drops to do that though, and people rioted when they tried to nerf it shadowlands
[0:34:41] sarkOpharg: Legion had 2+4 sets and trinkets, but not more
[0:34:55] Fingle1: but that titanforging tho, big worth
[0:34:57] Lctl10: *buying boosts with Gold - fixed it for you Mike :p

[0:35:26] MittensSlowpaw: As a mount collector when I did play I did this.. No shame
[0:35:29] EeraGames: @Katjix622 What they've shown so far is not really amazing, it's okay but it's not blowing socks off people. I like that some of the gear is going to look better but it's not a huge "back of the box" feature to me like I think a lot of people were expecting.
[0:35:30] Mordy_the_Mighty: @EeraGames FF14 has the same gear issue except instead of M+, you get a crafted set and are good to clear, though there is still farm you are expected to do if you intend to kill an Ultimate on release
[0:35:30] Mordwyl: Screw the RNG, but also screw buying it with real money
[0:35:30] knukles0: knukles0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months, currently on a 46 month streak! Morning, Ah ha I've discovered a new month of sub
[0:35:41] Lctl10: I am okay with boosting - I just wish token didnt exist
[0:35:42] Layercake: Tokens are there for that ...go wild
[0:35:43] Hunter_GS: okey but then the problem becomes the incentive/catchup thing. if patch 1 gear is still really good at the end of the expansion, then we should send people constantly to farm old stuff?
[0:35:45] Brandilath: On the individual level it's whatever. But the it scales to effect the whole community.
[0:35:52] urbish_: Is this an actual constructive post on an official forum? wtf

[0:36:16] EazzyBreezzy: remove catalyst maybe? can farm m+ gear to then turn into mythic lvl raid gear is a bit shit
[0:36:19] SoulSlicer808: switch to currency drops and slow down power upgrades
[0:36:22] SMilee996: Mythic plus cannibalised raiding
[0:36:22] SoulSlicer808: yep
[0:36:23] Hunter_GS: @Lctl10 scaleble items? then why would yo do endgame content if your gear just scales?

[0:36:31] ChunkeyNinja: righty, whats going on today. was just talking to broadband engineer
[0:36:32] Fingle1: some trinkets you used for multiple tiers in bfa, like the everyone stack one

[0:37:00] urbish_: hiii Chris
[0:37:00] Mordy_the_Mighty: they did make PvP specific gear already, PvP had the same issue with gear in ShB
[0:37:05] SMilee996: @preachlfw pvp power and pvp resilience worked like that
[0:37:10] knukles0: Yeah each end game gear should give bonuses to each, I mean PvP needs different stats, is it still all Vers

[0:37:19] Lctl10: @Hunter_GS It does work. but we are far apart in prespective, and thats okay. Have a good one :)
[0:37:35] Hupu_a: @Preachlfw  you have catalyst now so you could change pvp gear for pvp tier etc
[0:37:47] Shelana95: I get ha, I would like to try it for an expantion, but i cant say yes untill i gvien it a go
[0:37:50] Hunter_GS: @Lctl10 its not perspectives, its data. blizzard talked about this a billion times. if something have 0 incentives people arent doing it
[0:37:59] redroniksre: Then they could make WQ tier sets that are just straight fun
[0:38:06] Lctl10: @Hunter_GS Have a good one mate ^^
[0:38:18] rinmass: could make mythic cosmetic only, lets M+ players only have to do heroic if they wanna play what they like
[0:38:18] Cadwgan: @Hunter_GS Fun should always incentive, but people seem to need the carrot on the stick that keeps moving.
[0:38:50] DaftiDuck_: id rather tier just be mog, so then you dont feel like ur losing something when you drop the set
[0:39:07] SMilee996: The nazjatar gear sets had bonuses for the palace raid
[0:39:22] Hupu_a: nazjatar pearl gear ye
[0:39:23] ExiledDitto: We had Domination Shards that only worked in the worst zones in the game kek.
[0:39:23] OspreyRed: YEP I remember
[0:39:27] sarkOpharg: the laser
[0:39:30] MagmaScythe: laser thing?
[0:39:32] Pazy160: I'd love a world quest/solo Tier set thats more visual focused. A third active pet for a hunter, I would absolutely use that over a flat damage increase in most content.
[0:39:33] daris888: yes uldir
[0:39:34] Hunter_GS: @Cadwgan it should be but thats not how people work. even at my dnd table, the first question my players bring up is "what are we getting out of this"
[0:39:36] daris888: the laser
[0:39:36] Geri_0123: Despairge
[0:39:42] BlindOwlInTree: SoD Seems like BETA for wow2 basically test things and see what sticks to be implemented in retail later

[0:39:43] OspreyRed: lasers NODDERS
[0:39:48] sarkOpharg: yeah, it stacked every week
[0:39:50] Bixster: the main problem of raiding is the raiding itself. most good players i play with doesnt want to have fixed day where they have to play. m+ fixed that for them.
[0:39:51] PinkTaricFTW: @Preachlfw Like those pearl items for Azshara? :D

[0:40:13] StarscreamAoE: bissy bis pants Kreygasm
[0:40:16] Hunter_GS: and then you have the issue of having 3-4 gear sets/spec
[0:40:54] BuckyDK: Wish tiers did something more than just stats though :( the fantasy of gear is gone
[0:41:02] ravenofjudgement: Despairge benthic

[0:41:53] cerolith: that was fucking awful
[0:41:55] Philbobaggins12: @Preachlfw They need to go back to the old way of gear having innate gem slots, this whole farming for gem slots or RNG gem slots is fucking toxic and putrid
[0:42:01] Klogington: benthic was actually a pretty good MMO moment, apart from the infinite rolls it required
[0:42:02] Shelana95: Stoped raiding that raid cause other  reason, but connected
[0:42:03] alwiro: Madge
[0:42:03] ravenofjudgement: @Miss_Kas we all want to forget Despairge
[0:42:03] Glohri: Make WoW an rpg again. Don't score gear with a single number (gearscore). i.e. sometimes you want more mana, another time more health regen or maybe elemental resistance
[0:42:12] alwiro: RAGEY
[0:42:17] Miss_Kas: @ravenofjudgement Despairge
[0:42:18] Hupu_a: farmed benthic gear for 4 chars  KEKW
[0:42:32] knukles0: Benthic was brilliant for me doing normal and HC, meant I didnt need to over farm it
[0:42:44] EeraGames: NOTED being able to not play the game for a bit = bad
[0:42:56] gilbertron: obliterate the gear, itd solve so many issues
[0:43:01] DaftiDuck_: cap the amount of items ur can get in m+ in a week?
[0:43:08] Shakutar: One drop per boss let's fucking go

[0:43:14] Vehlin: fundamentally M+ has broken heroic raiding as content for people that donâ€™t want to commit to a Mythic roster.
[0:43:19] riotscream: lurker here cannot convince ppl from sod or wrath to even try dragonflight do to the way mythic raiding works ,is there a way to get back to a way were 1 players miss steak doesnt wipe a raid
[0:43:20] Tartuccio: it's because of M+
[0:43:36] Shelana95: But the bosses are tuned that way aswell. you have 0 chance if you dont have the gear
[0:43:54] Hunter_GS: but thats a minor thing in terms of the experience imo. okey you'll be close to bis in 3 weeks instead of 1. will that change the experience for the better?

[0:47:40] Hunter_GS: okey, but this is mythic, it shouldnt be that easy imo

[0:48:15] Zziggz: Great time watching but didnt wanna play it
[0:48:27] EeraGames: Either make Mythic difficulty the "RWF" difficulty and not designed for regular high end players, or make it something the top (say) 20% of the playerbase can do.
[0:48:35] Maddroxv: that's kinda the feel i have watching every race to world first
[0:48:44] Sphexs: They honestly just need to turn mythic into a challenge mode diffitculty
[0:48:47] roadroller_dah: not wanting to play it is the worst outcome of the two, if people only like watching raiding and dont wanna play thats not healthy for the game
[0:48:51] Maddroxv: i like watching it but WoW just can't entice me back
[0:48:51] SMilee996: Disable addons
[0:49:01] ployboi69: Phoinax orange floor Kappa
[0:49:01] nvwls: the hellscream buff?
[0:49:07] Hupu_a: 5%/week or something
[0:49:10] EmElw: funnily enough the icc version would also solve a lot of the issues ppl have
[0:49:12] gilbertron: getting new gear should be the nerf, but that hasnt been the case for a long time
[0:49:14] Lithirrdys: just set it so when the nerfs come in, the original is preserved as a "RWF difficulty" Shruge
[0:49:17] Furoan: Hellscreem's vigour that gave a progressive 5% buff every other week or something
[0:49:18] Stawnchy: @Preachlfw That gear progression has also been removed by M+, like his previous point
[0:49:24] Hunter_GS: i would be okey if mythic would not reward gear. turn that into a challange mode with cosmetical rewards and thats that
[0:49:29] sinclsw23: rofl
[0:49:30] Goregie: No
[0:49:31] Lionheartex: 30% LK is a joke of a fight for sure
[0:49:31] Hupu_a: soo.... Hard mode?
[0:49:32] Dernsby: Basically no
[0:49:32] Becore: NOPERS
[0:49:33] Yurian33: aint no way no how
[0:49:34] ployboi69: VoteNay
[0:49:35] ravenofjudgement: YEP some masochists would
[0:49:35] EeraGames: No
[0:49:36] Vehlin: min ilvl no echo for wow
[0:49:37] FILLAN88: Ofc they would do it but it'd need a reward
[0:49:37] 3rayed: NOPERS
[0:49:37] TulkasStream: No
[0:49:38] dutchmasterprime: 0.0001%
[0:49:39] savasci16: that's what the ICC buff let you do
[0:49:40] Zziggz: the addons dont help they basically tell you how to play
[0:49:40] realnzall: I haven't even done ANY mythic bosses since SoO
[0:49:41] nohomu67: YEP I did in Raid Finder
[0:49:42] Ractorious: nope
[0:49:43] Klogington: very few people - like wen u could turn off ICC buff
[0:49:44] krispytuesday: wow is boring
[0:49:44] Furoan: No
[0:49:44] GraaMee: lmao no
[0:49:45] daris888: no
[0:49:45] BoysAreVeryCute: good one
[0:49:45] aftergl0w: GIGACHAD
[0:49:49] gilbertron: no they would not have been LUL
[0:49:50] Bixster: Thats why i stopped mythic raiding and only raid heroic. Mechanics feel pretty good on heroic only, but the added mythic mechanics often feel like bullshit
[0:49:50] Hunter_GS: mine would, letsgo
[0:49:52] fokare: we would try it but not finish it probably
[0:49:52] MrCosines: yes, if there was an achievment or unique xmog
[0:49:55] Mordwyl: I'd sooner run Eureka fresh again than raid mythic
[0:49:58] Brayburn32: You could turn the buff off in ICC, nobody did of course.
[0:49:58] anaksana: some guilds tried no buff LK for the challenge but after they killed it already
[0:49:59] EeraGames: People want their loot, they don't care about the rest
[0:50:03] Hunter_GS: we are shitters but we would love the challange
[0:50:03] Furoan: would you optionally stick your junk into a cheese grater...
[0:50:04] Dernsby: Problem is that if there's a reward for it then it's just the 'new hardest' that everyone wants to do.
[0:50:06] demonitter: Make Curve pre-nerf only for fun?
[0:50:07] Siege28: even if you could, people would get bis gear first. so it wouldnt be the same
[0:50:12] SMilee996: If its their source of income :)
[0:50:14] MrCosines: just borrow out of FFXIV playbook - unique weapon look that is cool af
[0:50:17] knukles0: Keep a new mode, so LFR, Normal, HC, Mythic and RWF mode (no nerfs after cleared)
[0:50:22] Katjix622: Preach, have you ever played SWTOR?
[0:50:32] Lithirrdys: its content that already exists. takes minimal effort to maintain. even if 1% of players ever bothered... its still worth imo
[0:50:32] Riyshn: from the FFXIV perspective, runs of old raids with Echo turned off are still a thing
[0:50:38] Preachlfw: !game world of warcraft
[0:50:38] Streamlabs: Preachlfw changed the game to "World of Warcraft".
[0:50:38] StreamElements: @Preachlfw changed the game to "World of Warcraft"!
[0:50:45] yuiona: I mean people do min ilvl no echo runs
[0:50:49] ExiledDitto: Umm... Zskarn would get that button pressed every single time lmao.
[0:51:03] Khuja__: like a title for FF14
[0:51:10] Stawnchy: Some systems programmer out there having a cold sweat at the thought of trying to implement something like that lol
[0:51:14] Cadwgan: Like doing P8s with 1% more HP at min item level.
[0:51:19] BuckyDK: Heroic Kilâ€™Jaeden is my personal Vietnam but I woulnd't say I dind't have fun..
[0:51:22] Riyshn: or MINE runs
[0:51:26] yuiona: how about an achievement/title for doing the boss in its hardest state (e.g. release state)
[0:51:27] Durpah: Just add "Original" in front of whatever title the fight usually gives EZ
[0:51:29] Zziggz: I would like to see raids without add onns
[0:51:33] roadroller_dah: no one would be able to clear it
[0:51:34] Saint473: @katjix622 he did at launch, so a completely different game to today.
[0:51:37] Durpah: "Original Kingslayer"
[0:51:37] EeraGames: Yeah as someone who was in these at the time, MINE difficulty is NOT a 1:1 of the original, you need to strip a load of gear off to get close
[0:51:44] jace193: @Katjix622 yeah he has, i asked when he was doing his MMO deep dives. he wasn't a fan of the way it handled combat
[0:51:54] gilbertron: itd just split the mythic raid community down even more
[0:51:56] rudezki: wow bad 14 gud Shruge
[0:52:00] yuiona: i would love that
[0:52:02] shinra40: no
[0:52:04] SMilee996: So ur designing fights for the races ? Idk man
[0:52:08] Hupu_a: 99% would not
[0:52:08] Fingle1: just put rwf on a tourney  realm and tune the bosses properly
[0:52:09] yuiona: but i fear not many people
[0:52:09] sinclsw23: who would be capable?
[0:52:12] Streamlabs: ðŸ˜Ž See those cool metal posters behind Mike? Get your own with up to 33% OFF after visiting https://displate.com/PreachGaming/?art=619e85e06e135
[0:52:13] ployboi69: Dunno :/
[0:52:14] Cadwgan: @EeraGames We'd need a potency rollback too for a 1:1 reprisentation.
[0:52:17] Furoan: Some people would, but I think when it unlocked would be important
[0:52:17] Hunter_GS: yeah but then here comes the practicality: they cant even balance a mythic version. you think they would be able to make a doable ultimate that works?
[0:52:18] shinra40: ppl just want to get their gear then fuck off
[0:52:19] Siege28: individuals might want to. but gl getting a whole guild to do it
[0:52:20] nessardo: they could make a cosmetic in tribute to the world fisrt guild and then any guild that clears the original version gets it
[0:52:23] hiraikou: cosmetic and title hunters might
[0:52:30] onetwojango: what if there is *echo buff like in ff? you can also turn it off
[0:52:36] Elydian: You need an Elite difficulty for RWF that has the same rewards as mythic but cosmetic reward too.
[0:52:39] DaftiDuck_: I like cosmetics NODDERS
[0:52:41] Mordwyl: Make gear redundant for these challenges
[0:52:45] EeraGames: @Cadwgan True, but without them making a specific difficulty that's as close as you can get atm
[0:52:45] knukles0: I dont think many people would do it, but I can imagine a top 100 guild would like to do that after getting bis instead of farm raiding
[0:52:46] Bixster: Maybe the removal of mythic mounts and titles after the raid tier is over is a option. this way you have something to show of.
[0:52:46] Hupu_a: Rare and flashy mind you
[0:52:51] ravenofjudgement: SHINY GIMME
[0:52:51] furya91: mage tower?
[0:52:54] Geri_0123: more sell runs for echo then
[0:52:55] EeraGames: They'd put the cosmetic on the shop instead
[0:52:56] aridini_: just buy a carry EZ
[0:52:57] Taelan_: cosmetics are eternal, gear is worthless next tier
[0:52:57] SMilee996: Challenge mode dungeons
[0:53:00] EeraGames: Because they prefer money
[0:53:05] Hunter_GS: yeah a 100% weapon cosmetic drop, would be up for itt
[0:53:12] Yurian33: it would end up being the new "carry" gold mine for Echo and Limit
[0:53:16] Katjix622: @jace193 hehe was curious played it back in 2014 first mmo i ever played hated the camera speed
[0:53:17] shinra40: shame most of the cosmetics are bought for money so a guy who swiped looks cooler then a guy who does mythic fights
[0:53:22] hayleys: hayleys subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[0:53:26] Hunter_GS: yeah that was awesome KEKW
[0:53:35] Farthers: People werent happy with Varient dungeons because there werent enough rewards so you would need something pretty good.
[0:53:36] Sebbywebz: pgeCrisp
[0:53:36] Durpah: @EeraGames or put no effort into it to motivate you to get the shop stuff instead KEKL
[0:53:36] Siege28: maybe a challenge mode that sets your stats so that gear doesnt matter
[0:53:44] Katjix622: Katjix622 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Preachlfw's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[0:53:44] Katjix622: Katjix622 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Gaaldrion! 
[0:53:48] ravenofjudgement: Sebbywebz rooBobble
[0:53:51] AngryFil: like an axolotl mount Kappa
[0:53:53] EeraGames: @Durpah That too KEKW
[0:53:57] Sebbywebz: @ravenofjudgement pgeAYAYA
[0:54:03] Durpah: @Siege28 That, I like
[0:54:21] Decadence001: yep, had that meeting too
[0:54:24] Decadence001: was shit
[0:54:36] ThermalX: ThermalX subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:54:59] knukles0: Crusher said that i think
[0:55:02] fokare: yep and Tindral is still fucking guilds up itâ€™s crazy LUL
[0:55:20] sarkOpharg: beams still oneshot, so people are still chasing chinese pullcounts
[0:55:27] Hunter_GS: the race is the one, awesome, community ran compatitive event that this sphere NEEDS
[0:55:30] SMilee996: 8 man raids in wow might be interesting
[0:55:31] ployboi69: Butt?
[0:55:34] EeraGames: Would you want the RWF to change if not changing was damaging the game as a whole though?
[0:55:37] ployboi69: KEKW
[0:55:38] ravenofjudgement: no
[0:55:39] Lctl10: No.
[0:55:40] roadroller_dah: no
[0:55:41] Hupu_a: KEKW
[0:55:41] ployboi69: YEP
[0:55:42] Stayalone: for 1k guild Tindral is still a roadblock (maybe not aftet reset's nerf)
[0:55:42] Maddroxv: no
[0:55:42] CptGimp: objectivly no
[0:55:47] daris888: no
[0:55:49] aftergl0w: D: what would jesse do
[0:55:49] ravenofjudgement: @Preachlfw and HACKERMANS for WeakAuras
[0:55:55] lilipat27: :) :) :)
[0:55:55] EmElw: does it? just speeds things up but isn't a wall
[0:55:55] Maddroxv: it's a videogame not the stockmarket
[0:56:09] EeraGames: Not in any world
[0:56:10] redroniksre: Not at all
[0:56:11] Hunter_GS: i mean i dont think its a problem if a game is that complex on that level
[0:56:13] EazzyBreezzy: being able to make a business out of a race team KEKW
[0:56:14] ployboi69: Weak aura already done that for me Kappa
[0:56:16] gettincranky: If you dont need a whole 50 man production team, are you even trying?
[0:56:16] aftergl0w: Oh those guys
[0:56:16] siren_industries: sireni18NADEMA
[0:56:19] SMilee996: Its overkill
[0:56:22] sarkOpharg: @Stayalone We are basically just dying to beams, it'll cut a few p3 pulls, but probably not too many
[0:56:26] OspreyRed: they had analysts just for augmentation evokers LUL
[0:56:26] aftergl0w: 5Head
[0:56:29] FILLAN88: Blizz would have to make RWF a separate e-sport, where the fights are harder, but release easier versions for the general populace
[0:56:29] ravenofjudgement: Shruge I thinks it's fucking stupid
[0:56:32] Hunter_GS: me too, i think its great that there are levels to this game that reaches hights like this
[0:56:34] rerakando: you only like it because you come from that environment which is a total bubble
[0:56:34] od3x: Its the length people are willing to go for glory
[0:56:35] knukles0: No but would anyone want the RWF be cleared in 24 hours from release
[0:56:38] od3x: human nature when you care
[0:56:39] Its_Just_Pete: !displate
[0:56:39] Streamlabs: ðŸ˜Ž See those cool metal posters behind Mike? Get your own with up to 33% OFF after visiting https://displate.com/PreachGaming/?art=619e85e06e135
[0:56:39] EeraGames: @ravenofjudgement agreed
[0:56:41] Shakutar: Once something becomes competitive enough such things are unavoidable as crazy as it might sound to outsiders
[0:56:46] FILLAN88: Organize it like a league where guilds can be promoted to or fall from
[0:56:47] sinclsw23: it's a halo feature for the game
[0:56:52] alwiro: BUT KEKW
[0:56:53] penBaron: We don't see it tho
[0:57:02] OspreyRed: those are the raids most people want
[0:57:06] EeraGames: @penBaron big true
[0:57:06] Siege28: make a separate version for rwf?
[0:57:13] MittensSlowpaw: I remember raiding till 2am for years. I don't miss it.
[0:57:20] Maddroxv: it's great for viewer content but objectively for the health of endgame raiding that they need to tune around the 1% then nerf it to shit it's just bad
[0:57:23] Stayalone: @sarkOpharg way too many oneshot and instant raid wipe mechanics for 1 boss imo
[0:57:24] Hunter_GS: but at the current system you have your chill ass gnomer, and sweats have their complex stuff. i think thats good
[0:57:39] EmElw: the original sin is gear YEP gw is right all other mmos are wrong
[0:57:45] luchael: ZackSquat
[0:57:47] Teh_Gaffer: fixed ilvl?
[0:57:49] Decadence001: but that obliterates any real competition in RWF. It's only the teams that have all those outside things that win @Preachlfw no-one else has a look in
[0:58:04] Atticon: It's already a different version when they inevitably massively nerf it after
[0:58:07] KaiZen2048: ALOO Chat and Preach good morning!
[0:58:12] Streamlabs: Save a life: Learn CPR in 15 minutes - free with British Heart Foundationâ€™s RevivR: http://tinyurl.com/PreachCPR

[0:58:22] urbish_: ALOO
[0:58:24] SlagPose: i would straight up stop watching if it's not on live.
[0:58:25] Stayalone: @Hunter_GS Gamestar won't write itself (jk) Kappa
[0:58:33] Hunter_GS: the rwf is a huge boost for wow
[0:58:38] Caligulove11: You gotta have those eyeballs
[0:58:40] MrZxorm: WRF is one of the biggest draws oin Twitch as well
[0:58:40] SMilee996: So compromise the game for its sake?
[0:58:40] roadroller_dah: @Preachlfw yeah but you said yourself you dont wanna play despite liking the race
[0:58:40] nerefwow: only viewership
[0:58:40] Ractorious: yeah make the game good, then people will care more about the spectacle
[0:58:42] Hunter_GS: @Stayalone im done for the day, what is this? KEKW
[0:58:43] ratskyz: ye but after that no one cares
[0:58:49] nerefwow: those people aren't actually raiding though
[0:58:49] EeraGames: RTW does not outweigh the play experience of the entire rest of the playerbase, simply put
[0:58:52] JamesandHat: Its a big draw aye bit i think you are def biased in that take and value it more than it actually does
[0:58:59] hal2210: but why tho is that
[0:59:00] MysticalOS: they just need to do nerfs faster, especially to unreasonable 1 mistake insta wipes raid mechanics that reasonabily only 3 guilds can even do pre nerf.
[0:59:05] Stayalone: @Hunter_GS KEKW
[0:59:06] yuiona: for me its you who got me back repeatedly KEKW
[0:59:13] Alyassus: the newest patch coming out is what brings people back not the RWF
[0:59:25] Decadence001: i'd still watch if RWF was on tourney realms. Still wouldn't make me play retail though
[0:59:35] Kage_Jittai: 5% is generous
[0:59:38] roadroller_dah: @Preachlfw does blizzard have any metrics to show that rtwf actually increases player numbers
[0:59:40] EmElw: get rid of everything but lfr YEP
[0:59:42] Lctl10: @Alyassus disagree there
[0:59:43] Hunter_GS: well that 5% is a big fucking group of people
[0:59:43] Geri_0123: without any data i'd think most ppl stop at normal/heroic level
[0:59:46] ployboi69: YEP
[0:59:47] gilbertron: nerfing the loot would fix it, if rwf had to do bosses at -20 ilvl compared to what others would be, it wouldnt need nerfs
[0:59:50] alwiro: CHOP CHOP
[0:59:55] ratskyz: RWF is fun to watch but once is done if the game is not in a good state no one will play it anyway
[1:00:00] Yatak1000: I would probably be a bit more into it if more people took part. It just seems unreachable by most people.
[1:00:00] SMilee996: Take out the beans
[1:00:03] MrZxorm: I don't do mytic raiding, I wouldn't want to to be removed.
[1:00:04] DzikiWegorz1223: just delete pet battles entirely, idc
[1:00:07] StarscreamAoE: MMO Buffet NOTED
[1:00:10] JamesandHat: more than 99 percent of players have never attempted mythic
[1:00:11] Atticon: Even Normal pugs get affected by Mythic meta. They shouldn't, but they are.
[1:00:14] BuckyDK: If we cater to the majority the game would be turned into a lobby mmo, where nobody leaves Stormwind/Org and only queues
[1:00:16] Hunter_GS: yepp, the competitive part is keeping the game alive
[1:00:21] ployboi69: That's me :)
[1:00:23] aftergl0w: Shruge just remove lalas though
[1:00:24] CptGimp: key factor of WoW is nostalgia
[1:00:26] Ractorious: mythic raiding is the main course in wow cuz it only has 3 things you can do
[1:00:29] Elrick_James: Yeah but what if catering so hard to that High End scene is killing the rest of the Game?
[1:00:31] moraeds: Im not saying to remove it, but it seems blizz spends proportionally large amount of time on that 5% (i would assume even less)
[1:00:35] SMilee996: But those raids are super easy
[1:00:40] Decadence001: delay M+ season start until much later in a raid tier?
[1:00:44] vallhaliel: In games I think the least interesting thing is "balancing the equation" (of the gameplay). Hierarchy, art/narrative/music, presentation, gameplay and then the numbers.
[1:00:49] majkos: that 5% generates a lot of money,  they buy tons of transfers, race changes and tokens :D
[1:00:53] MrZxorm: @Atticon It only effects them if they let it. I play with all druids deff not in meta
[1:01:09] Vehlin: the buffet example is interesting. In its current form wow is like a buffet that doesnâ€™t let you eat the prawn toast until youâ€™ve eaten several servings of chicken satay
[1:01:11] MittensSlowpaw: Agreed Preach
[1:01:16] EeraGames: Yeah, Original Naxx was a meatgrinder KEKW
[1:01:18] MittensSlowpaw: Loved that video.
[1:01:23] SMilee996: Because internet and hardware limitations maybe?
[1:01:33] chillpasta: 1/10 page lol, jesus
[1:01:44] aftergl0w: KEKW
[1:01:44] Lctl10: they were - and they were awesome
[1:01:44] Alyassus: @Lctl10 how? Do people really pay 15$ subscritpion for WoW to then watch the race on twitch? You don't need to play the game to enjoy the race, or?
[1:01:47] GoobleGamingTV: They were superhard
[1:01:47] Caligulove11: Different time
[1:01:47] Yatak1000: Tbc dungeons were great
[1:01:49] Tartuccio: or classic TBC more accurely
[1:01:51] yuiona: "Cthun is mathematically impossible" KEKW
[1:01:54] ratskyz: RWF is a fun addition to watch for 2 weeks, but making the game good should be blizz priority
[1:01:56] ployboi69: TOXIC STRUMMER Kappa
[1:01:57] nahey: shattered halls <3
[1:02:02] Enoz___: Heroic TBC dungeons were so much fun. and difficult

[1:02:08] Decadence001: @Preachlfw clearing mythic raid unlocks M+. It'll piss a lot of people off, but may solve some of the gearing issue during the tier? Shruge
[1:02:11] Kanyusi: D:

[1:02:16] aftergl0w: T D: S
[1:02:16] 3lfidan: In my classic experience we had multiple 'coming to jesus' moments because some of the dads were coasting and not pressing much of anything
[1:02:20] Lctl10: @Alyassus RWF gets people hyped and nostalgic about the good times. Seeing others enjoy it so much, usually makes people want to jump in on the fun as well

[1:02:41] Hupu_a: Clearing mythic unlocks pvp KEKW
[1:02:44] Syrjyys: I suffered trough Sha of Fear progress for a reason!
[1:02:45] Txn_Nerothos: TBC still my fav expension, it was a good mix of vanilla raw and a bit of convenience that still made it a good rpg
[1:02:51] Tartuccio: Hell nah, I love M+ would never clear mythic riad for it
[1:02:52] JamesandHat: More people play mythic plus than raid at mythic level god that would kill the scene
[1:02:53] mimekh: ydcbNODDERS
[1:02:53] redroniksre: Not even just the game, even the tech was way different back then
[1:02:58] Stawnchy: classic only now playable in 800x600
[1:03:02] EeraGames: @Lctl10 I've never felt nostalgic for raiding because of RWF, it's just insane now compared to what it used to be. No interest in doing that
[1:03:02] Decadence001: i loved shattered hall heroic as a prot paladin. Our guild's warrior tanks respecced to fury to have me run them through it for the timed achievement @Preachlfw
[1:03:11] asqroz: a lot of PPl dont event know Star,Scholo and few others were 210men dungeons
[1:03:12] alwiro: clearing m+ unlocks the mtx shop Kappa
[1:03:20] aftergl0w: Sure
[1:03:21] sinclsw23: the meta game is ludicrously different now
[1:03:22] asqroz: 10men*
[1:03:22] ployboi69: Sure Kappa
[1:03:22] majkos: Sure
[1:03:23] Ractorious: Sure
[1:03:23] ravenofjudgement: Sure
[1:03:24] alwiro: Sure
[1:03:25] Hozzar1: Sure
[1:03:25] huntaoce: Sure
[1:03:30] Maddroxv: yup its why i have no interrest in classic, did it 20 years ago and dont need a altered redo of it
[1:03:31] KaiZen2048: Sure
[1:03:33] Supersenkel: 1/10 Aware
[1:03:35] spicyfishalmond: are they still updating WoW after all these years?
[1:03:35] Decadence001: so did I - just press consecrate KEKW
[1:03:40] alwiro: Sure elite of the elite
[1:03:41] Yatak1000: Shadowlabs was a good laugh
[1:03:42] JamesandHat: Nostalgia is a hell of a drug
[1:03:52] Siege28: they could start with the addon problem. they seem to have just accepted that it cant be fixed
[1:03:53] Lctl10: @EeraGames Sure - but a lotta people don't feel that way. Thats the same as streamers playing a game and bringing people back etc
[1:04:02] rudezki: realm worst
[1:04:03] Phabey: EZ
[1:04:11] alwiro: "i am kinda of a big deal" EZ
[1:04:20] ployboi69: realm Blindess?
[1:04:30] Kage_Jittai: Black Morass?
[1:04:30] Geri_0123: black morass?
[1:04:32] Stawnchy: Morass?
[1:04:33] nahey: black morass
[1:04:33] TheFuriyon: black morass?
[1:04:33] Lctl10: Black Morass?
[1:04:33] nvwls: well of eternity?
[1:04:35] Decadence001: blak morass
[1:04:37] alwiro: more ass?
[1:04:40] EeraGames: @Lctl10 Yep, but my point is just that it's not a 100% effect on everyone, some people don't get that nostalgia
[1:04:49] Vinestra28: yep
[1:04:50] Lionheartex: that shit pre nerf was a wild dungeon
[1:04:50] Vinestra28: kara key
[1:04:53] Decadence001: yep
[1:04:54] sinclsw23: black morass - oh those were the days
[1:04:59] Geri_0123: black morass was touggh on tbc launchÃº
[1:05:00] Decadence001: was a pain in the ass dungeon
[1:05:06] Txn_Nerothos: black morass was both so good and so shit KEKW
[1:05:07] Lctl10: @EeraGames I know-. but you will always see an increase in players when RWF is going on, even for people that dont raid
[1:05:08] BuckyDK: It used to be hard?
[1:05:16] Stawnchy: Attunement needed some extra bs too didnt it? LIke no portal damage?
[1:05:28] Decadence001: BUT, you could get a clear and then port in people to  get the Kara key quest done @Preachlfw
[1:05:35] Decadence001: at least at launch
[1:05:36] gao_ftw: IHaveAQuestion What made TBC dungeons hard? Was it just tuning or something else?
[1:05:40] Ractorious: not enough people did mythic raids so let's remove mythic as well NODDERS
[1:05:40] Hunter_GS: yeah, thats the easy answer to most of these things btw "because people wouldnt engage"
[1:05:46] EmElw: @gao_ftw they fucked your tanks
[1:05:49] zedeh7: 15?
[1:05:50] ravenofjudgement: @gao_ftw XFFING
[1:05:53] Lctl10: @gao_ftw Needing CC and really good focus
[1:05:57] Mordwyl: Ulduar was glorious
[1:05:59] EazzyBreezzy: ulduar was amazing i loved it
[1:05:59] sinclsw23: yes
[1:06:00] Yatak1000: Because it gave the players CHOICE
[1:06:03] Hupu_a: it was
[1:06:03] Phabey: my fave NODDERS
[1:06:04] anjilo: One of my favourites. certainly.
[1:06:04] EeraGames: eww
[1:06:05] Atreyu_Lavellan: It's the top boy for sure imo
[1:06:07] Geri_0123: @gao_ftw and a big jump from vanilla
[1:06:07] Decadence001: @gao_ftw tuning yes, but also players worse and different toolkits
[1:06:07] Txn_Nerothos: forcing yourself to limit DPS on XT to not engage the hard mode was one of the fun things
[1:06:07] BuckyDK: I loved the cars
[1:06:09] EazzyBreezzy: i didnt even clear it but it was amazing in current content
[1:06:09] Mordwyl: It was one of a kind
[1:06:10] Mezegis_Yo: Ulduar was perfection
[1:06:15] MittensSlowpaw: I remember doing hard modes in Ulduar. It was fun to prove myself to others on doing it.
[1:06:16] Markreivi: ratJAMMEST
[1:06:18] gao_ftw: IHaveAQuestion thank you chat
[1:06:18] urbish_: @gao_ftw Joel
[1:06:22] PinkTaricFTW: Ulduar is amazing, but it was followed by TOGC @Preachlfw
[1:06:23] gao_ftw: dont joel me
[1:06:26] gao_ftw: im free here
[1:06:28] ravenofjudgement: @gao_ftw Joel
[1:06:28] gao_ftw: Madge
[1:06:31] Farstrider__: So immersive and adventurous too
[1:06:31] Mordwyl: Variable difficulty and rewards within the raid itself
[1:06:36] seiniyta: And just the atmosphere of the place was fucking amazing
[1:06:37] Philbobaggins12: Ulduar was BIS
[1:06:40] FILLAN88: Vezax sucks
[1:06:41] Geri_0123: it also lead to memes on the first raid night, big red button, let's press it
[1:06:49] sinclsw23: oblivion!
[1:06:49] alwiro: @gao_ftw Joeler
[1:06:50] Stawnchy: But razor was also optional
[1:06:50] margowowo: Firefighter prog PTSD Despairge
[1:06:51] EmElw: vezax is the worst boss ever made cant change my mind
[1:06:53] Decadence001: Algalon @Preachlfw . up til then, it was amazing
[1:06:55] Hunter_GS: i really didnt like it, but i also can see why people love it
[1:06:59] TheFuriyon: Iâ€™m on the fence on Flame Leviathan
[1:07:10] Philbobaggins12: @Preachlfw Yog 0 lights was insane when it was current prog
[1:07:11] IAmSolari: I don't like the first one with the cars, the rest is amazing
[1:07:12] Streamlabs: ðŸ˜Ž See those cool metal posters behind Mike? Get your own with up to 33% OFF after visiting https://displate.com/PreachGaming/?art=619e85e06e135
[1:07:14] Geri_0123: normal was just there
[1:07:14] Syrjyys: In my classic guild Ulduar was the point where it became clear where some TBC raiders weren't up for bosses that have mechanics
[1:07:30] Decadence001: @Syrjyys same here
[1:07:31] fokare: what if you could only do a boss once per week on any difficulty but you could pick what difficulty you wanted per boss
[1:07:31] Saint473: The issue with hard mode for me is that they only tried it once
[1:07:33] pablio_escobari: with this argument "not enough done this" we could also ask why do we have mythic raids? PepeLaugh
[1:07:38] Yatak1000: Get the blue barrels!
[1:07:54] JamesandHat: I still think lfr should become normal mode for raiding then heroic and mythic above raise the skill floor of players a bit
[1:07:54] ravenofjudgement: NOCRINGE ROCHE
[1:07:55] sinclsw23: flame leviathn was the pinnacle of first bosses
[1:07:56] MrCosines: I always felt the problem with hard mode was the reward wasn't tangible. it was just an achievement right? hard to show off. just my theory as to why not enough ppl did it
[1:08:05] gao_ftw: BAAAAD TOOOOOYS
[1:08:07] margowowo: Min-maxing the barrel stacks was satisfying
[1:08:07] Decadence001: @Syrjyys actually, it was just before - Sarth 3d. Our 10man team was very very specifically the best players.
[1:08:09] gao_ftw: XFFING
[1:08:12] FILLAN88: There's a clear difficulty shift once you get to the Watchers and it's so good
[1:08:19] Haximaxi: could not actually :>
[1:08:20] willyd129: difficult content always gets super low turnout regardless
[1:08:21] PinkTaricFTW: My guild was hard-stuck on XT Normal for almost 2 months :D
[1:08:21] Txn_Nerothos: yeah forcing yourself to limit DPS on XT to not engage the hard mode was one of the fun things
[1:08:21] EmElw: xt was the last boss to be killed actually
[1:08:36] Lionheartex: in Wrath classic it was actually insanely hard - couldn't meet DPS check in week 1
[1:08:36] ravenofjudgement: ravenofjudgement gifted a Tier 1 sub to gao_ftw! They have given 1305 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:08:43] ravenofjudgement: sniper Joel
[1:08:44] MrTharne_: XT BabyRage
[1:08:47] gao_ftw: @ravenofjudgement Thanks for the gift sub! Joel
[1:08:47] TheFuriyon: fun fact; xt hard mode was the only boss in Ulduar not killed on hard mode during wrath classic @preachlfw
[1:08:59] TheFuriyon: week 1
[1:09:00] Syrjyys: @Decadence001 oh they didn't really even bother with 3d, I joined during Naxx cause friend baited me in to help their roster issues
[1:09:03] Decadence001: @TheFuriyon what?
[1:09:26] ravenofjudgement: Wokege
[1:09:27] ployboi69: DMCA SONG
[1:09:31] TheFuriyon: @decadence001 corrected myself, I believe xt 10m hm wasnâ€™t killed week 1 in classic
[1:09:34] ployboi69: NotLikeThis
[1:09:35] Decadence001: @Syrjyys wrath naxx was piss easy though. we cleared it still in T6 week 2
[1:09:38] The_ElMuchacho: boomerJAM
[1:09:42] ioWaxo: chat any TLDR on what preach found weird/hate-worthy on FF15? i saw the tweet
[1:10:03] Txn_Nerothos: onyxia moment
[1:10:09] aftergl0w: PauseChamp
[1:10:12] d__rek: the healing check was insane too
[1:10:17] Maddroxv: actual hard healing fight too
[1:10:24] Txn_Nerothos: @ioWaxo he just discovered the game going from open world to forced story corridors
[1:10:33] urbish_: @iowaxo he's into the linear section near the end and not enjoying it
[1:10:42] Syrjyys: @Decadence001 It was, but I can't complain since it was really good as my 1st raid tier ever. 2nd time around was just a snooze fest
[1:10:56] Decadence001: i loved this hardmode
[1:11:02] Durpah: @Txn_Nerothos ngl the game is way more enjoyable if you jsut do whatever you feel like doing, but if you get pushed to msq..
[1:11:04] Hunter_GS: yeah i love the zoom out transitions
[1:11:04] GoobleGamingTV: And the dispell on the tank you had 0,5 seconds to do
[1:11:08] urbish_: AAAA
[1:11:09] Hozzar1: Dmca music
[1:11:11] ravenofjudgement: peepoHeadbangEGuitar
[1:11:13] hal2210: Oldge
[1:11:17] DespairInShadows: Wokege
[1:11:22] Decadence001: managing the tanking and healing for this one was a great feeling
[1:11:30] Syrjyys: @Decadence001 and yeah John at classic they used the PTR version, so overtuned that nobody killed it before nerf
[1:11:32] BuckyDK: Good old 2008 edgy AMV
[1:11:55] ravenofjudgement: HUHH
[1:11:58] anaksana: So they just decided to not do them at all?
[1:12:00] ravenofjudgement: ?????
[1:12:00] Habibi4life: They didn't say "Boring", they said it wasn't feasible to continue to design due to cost
[1:12:04] Decadence001: ok then, sure
[1:12:05] urbish_: So they just stopped doing it altogether? bs
[1:12:05] BuckyDK: Good thing we have zero boring repeatable things in WoW right guys
[1:12:07] demonitter: It "Might" get boring, so do it never
[1:12:10] Riyshn: Ok but... still do it sometimes
[1:12:11] Lithirrdys: repeatedly = boring... so lets NEVER do it again KEKW
[1:12:11] Yatak1000: NotLikeThis
[1:12:19] Brandilath: Unlike how exciting it is now.
[1:12:22] Elydian: You know what else is boring, just removing the whole thing.
[1:12:22] Decadence001: one and done then
[1:12:23] Caligulove11: If they did it the same way every time sure. But they haven't done it since
[1:12:42] TheFuriyon: you know how you have meta achievements for every raid tier? could just rework some of those achievements to buff the boss if you do the trigger
[1:12:43] EeraGames: And by doing that they've kept Ulduar great Kappa
[1:12:46] Syrjyys: but.... heroic ELITE gear
[1:12:57] Yatak1000: Probably
[1:12:59] IAmSolari: considering how much of a mess council bosses are in retail currently, I'm surprised they haven't tried it
[1:13:02] Allessii: Yes
[1:13:02] Maddroxv: im sure at the time it did
[1:13:05] margowowo: When was the last time we got a boss like Ra-den where it was time locked per week as a final hard mode boss?
[1:13:11] Phabey: my favourite food might get boring if I eat it too frequently, so I'll never eat it again 5Head
[1:13:12] Streamlabs: Save a life: Learn CPR in 15 minutes - free with British Heart Foundationâ€™s RevivR: http://tinyurl.com/PreachCPR
[1:13:17] Elydian: It's definitely that they just couldn't be bothered.
[1:13:22] Decadence001: actually true
[1:13:25] BuckyDK: Lukewarm take: it takes money to make a good game
[1:13:27] Kage_Jittai: Sounds like the same excuse they gave for not doing the mage tower for so long. Being that they were waiting for a reward.
[1:13:31] alwiro: naaaaah, running splits is the best content KEKW
[1:13:35] Hunter_GS: i mean its simpler to just have a toggle
[1:13:38] Maddroxv: but they also had to remove it so they could up MAU numbers
[1:13:43] nohomu67: PepeLaugh They'll find a way
[1:13:46] Quatron: So thats a good thing... Because F*** splits
[1:13:54] Hunter_GS: yeah but if there are no splits, we cant see you eating beans
[1:13:57] Farstrider__: Splits is BIS content because then the casters needs to be extra fun :D
[1:14:02] Siege28: AAA devs are very adverse to not putting the money on screen. secret modes etc are against that design philosophy
[1:14:10] Caligulove11: Players are only going to do the thing that the WoW team incentivizes
[1:14:11] Bixster: Wouldnt this just mean that they only do 20 splits week one and then go with giga guys in week two?
[1:14:25] Ren26: there are 5 difficulties really, mythic has pre- and post- nerf
[1:14:29] JamesandHat: Mythic is just defualt hard mode now
[1:14:35] IAmSolari: Nobody apart from the top 1% enjoys mythic
[1:14:47] EeraGames: Basically removed the "in raid" choice of difficulty to a before raid choice
[1:15:00] ravenofjudgement: yes
