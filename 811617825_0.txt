[2:20:46] bisheped: new frog :)
[2:20:47] Pen_OW: yeah, if you kill all the rares, get lucky on drops and collect the Scourgestones, you will be fully geared in a few hours at most.
[2:20:47] vodloser: @pewtanblot monkaGIGA
[2:20:50] dankNstein_: m+ is a waste of time dont bother
[2:20:51] pewtanblot: Welcome @tfeng
[2:20:56] itsKrissBruh: i used to watch your irl way back in the day and got back into your streams recently since myself got back intro vr too lol
[2:20:57] zztoppog: roflgatorSmile
[2:20:57] pulganinja: @PolygonStatic do you have a recommendation on how to choose/? haha
[2:21:01] POPCOIN: it'll help you early on
[2:21:03] bisheped: @pewtanblot <3
[2:21:05] hamlife_: you dont NEED to minmax. It iwll just make leveling in SL smoother thats all
[2:21:12] murkhouse: ya it'll be faster to gear up w/ m+, the rares are pretty cancer
[2:21:12] vynfu: @Liriumn, i get you, there will always be the same negative opinions after 2-3months though. the best way to decide is your own experiece :)
[2:21:14] theKinaid: it helps to catch up a bit, but no sense in hardcore grinding it
[2:21:21] murkhouse: @jakenbakeLIVE if u get a plate grp you'll get gear way faster in m+
[2:21:22] Aelanian: its moreso to just catch up and help you early in the expac, also some transmog stuff if you dont ahve it
[2:21:23] takanodai: hello
[2:21:24] hamlife_: not using Elvui WEIRD
[2:21:30] cheese_beaver: cloak doesnt matter
[2:21:33] ilikecheesecats: PepeLaugh default ui
[2:21:36] herpladerp: legendary cloak quest isnt worth doing at this point
[2:21:42] PolygonStatic: @pulganinja honestly you can do both, but just start with a race you want to play. doesnt make a big difference otherwise
[2:21:42] theKinaid: this is kinda just for alts to catch up a bit
[2:21:42] miffle12: YEP DICKS
[2:21:45] dankNstein_: do not do neck/cloak/mythics/raids right now thats the biggest waste of time
[2:21:52] Frog69: ^
[2:21:55] zakurx: are they getting rid of heart of azerath?
[2:22:00] Knoives: Im plate You can invite
[2:22:03] hamlife_: dude i'd help you so much but im on EU SadgeCry
[2:22:14] kniftty: yea, all of the rares are former bosses
[2:22:14] dankNstein_: he drops his og trinket too
[2:22:16] theKinaid: a lot of what you'll grind out will be replaced during questing
[2:22:16] Sunni011: cant trade loot fromj rares anyway

[2:22:56] Aelanian: theres an addon "rarescanner" itll give you locations and the items it drops, and timers
[2:22:59] Shaneska: putricide has a trinket that people want

[4:37:18] crusade03: deciding between warrior and death knight, any recommendations?
[4:37:26] Teipo: i like both equally
[4:37:30] sagexf: @teipo sub rogue is hard af
[4:37:34] SkywardRaven: @Drxda2 they are strong, and every raid still needs 1 for the 5% magic damage regardless
[4:37:34] Frog69: @crussade1 druid
[4:37:38] FUNKz: @Drxda2 demonology is either utter trash or godlike and I think it's the trash version atm
[4:37:40] ownCrown: Does SL release 1 day earlier in na?
[4:37:42] crusade03: no druid LUL
[4:38:01] FUNKz: @Drxda2 oh nvm, i read it wrong derp
[4:38:01] Teipo: yeah sub rogue is pretty difficult
[4:38:05] Teipo: its pretty fun tho
[4:38:20] KorbenDallas815: chat, who is the other guy in the voice chat, not rob
[4:38:22] toinnyy: Hi roflgatorWave

[4:38:24] TrueDrag0n: Welcome to the stream! @sieef_35
[4:38:33] sagexf: @teipo it killed my brain so i switched to Outlaw
[4:38:46] Teipo: i played outlaw a lot in bfa and i enjoyed it
[4:38:51] Teipo: is it mostly the same in shadowlands?
[4:38:52] FUNKz: @Teipo as a WW main, monks are super fun, all 3 specs are great, but if you plan to dps in raids with your alt, rogue is safer to play
[4:38:57] hamlife_: Game Changers FeelsStrongMan
[4:39:04] TrueDrag0n: We also saw that gachiHYPER
[4:39:09] hamlife_: the sumo stream gachiW
[4:39:17] Teipo: yeah ive been messing around on my WW and the mastery system is super fun
[4:39:40] FUNKz: @Teipo balancing teams don't like WW and it's avarage at best the last like 6 years
[4:39:45] TrueDrag0n: Thats so wholesome Jake widepeepoHappy
[4:39:54] hamlife_: https://www.twitch.tv/jakenbakelive/clip/FrigidCuteAppleWOOP?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time
[4:40:05] hamlife_: @roflgator
[4:40:19] Teipo: yeah thats the main problem for me i gotta decide if id rather have a spec i enjoy more or a spec that pumps more dps
[4:40:58] XxMrFiresxX: ads are bad without a sub
[4:41:01] sagexf: @teipo play what you enjoy the Most thats prio number one
[4:41:01] Tekly1: yo whats a good mount to farm
[4:41:04] Cafe0le: ww is s tier in arena and really good in m+, according to people that tested raids is good but not top there
[4:41:08] PinkWardlol: do they have to run a certain amount of ads a week? or meet a certain watchtime/streamtime a month?
[4:41:11] Teipo: @ddales true
[4:41:19] Teipo: im not pushing for world first or anything like that
[4:41:26] drux7: jnbSalute
[4:41:31] FUNKz: @Teipo I main WW since wod, actually trialed for a mythic guild this prepatch and got a spot in mythic prog, but will have to probably gear more characters just to be ready to swap out if ww's are super bad
[4:41:47] SinicaLRyu: Pureblood Fire Hawk @Tekly1
[4:41:51] zombiev0mit: looks like bird pooping on them wtf KEKW

[4:42:28] zombiev0mit: so this is world of warcraft Sadge
[4:42:32] crusade03: what server is jake in?
[4:42:33] FUNKz: @Teipo but from leveling a lot of characters this prepatch, monks are the most fun class to me personally, all 3 specs are a joy to play
[4:42:34] hamlife_: sounds fine to me
[4:42:39] podjkins_: you should get rarescanner
[4:42:41] kittymeowmeoww: What is Jake even doing?
[4:42:44] blewbeary: think it starts at the 4 min mark
[4:42:51] KabaneriTV: What realm?

[4:43:07] Teipo: @FUNKz ive only played WW so i dont know much about BM and MW
[4:43:10] Frog69: ya theres nothing else to play Sadge
[4:43:40] Cafe0le: bm is still great and mw is the worst healer i think LUL
[4:43:45] FUNKz: @Teipo well, just know they are all a fun spec
[4:44:09] HansRNG: are you playing vr later?

[4:44:43] shaun986: the icecrown rares put black stuff on the ground
[4:44:44] Mastermudkipz57: 4Head just dodge it
[4:45:00] FUNKz: @Teipo tbh, if you like both rogue and monks, just level them both and play them both, SL is way better for alts than last couple expansions, i'm gonna have WW as my main, rogue as my alt and then hunter cause it's braindead easy
[4:45:04] Mastermudkipz57: POGGERS
[4:45:16] IlAsunaIl: their0Sleep
[4:45:23] shaun986: loot Clap

[4:46:13] Acaurd: yeah one from Nathanos, and one from an ICC rare spawn
[4:46:17] FUNKz: @Teipo you won't have to farm islands for 10hrs a day to level up your neck to equip better armor LUL
[4:46:18] Punchkin: 25 Scourgestones = 3 Things. You need 15 things to buy one piece of gear. So 125 Scourgestones = 1 piece of gear
[4:46:33] otterdangerous: @jakenbakeLIVE rarescanner addon it shows times and loot
[4:46:40] Cafe0le: sl launch is going to break the game literaly, everyone cramped into one zone, hasnt happened since tbc LUL
[4:47:03] Acaurd: Which server are they chillin on?
[4:47:04] zombiev0mit: arazona KEKW
[4:47:06] FUNKz: @Teipo most people in my guild are leveling 2 characters back to back, since all the stuff unlocks the day after launch you have a day free for leveling
[4:47:12] Teipo: @FUNKz yeah i ended up only playing rogue for the majority of bfa cause i didnt want to level up my heart again on all my alts

[5:05:39] FUNKz: @Teipo because you will need to choose which legendary to go first and there's like one for pvp/raid/m+ etc. just wait a couple days before peak of serenity guide for SL comes out and see what you like then
[5:05:41] GetBooped: Don't call out Roflgator. He'll just dip and go back to VRChat
[5:05:54] happypotato420: @PinkWardlol he said december starts moving
[5:05:56] dankNstein_: groups push past +15 especially early in seasons because theres more loot distribution for completion its not just for io
