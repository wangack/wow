[0:25:13] panjack13: The reason why PVE servers exist
[0:25:17] jakethesnake112: because it was funny
[0:25:31] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[0:26:02] panjack13: Couldn't agree more
[0:26:02] HumungaaDungaa: PVE servers have worse players even for pve though
[0:26:10] Midiosa: before boons, we had three of our raiders make ally accounts and gank most of us for our buff
[0:27:28] yoooofi: sounds like the typical wow player
[0:27:37] Ranzorx: yeah I'd be gonezo from that guild
[0:27:38] nillgren: Revenge
[0:27:40] MaulerX: The power of troll is very consuming
[0:27:44] Midiosa: most of the guild never knew.  only like 5 of us found out at the end of classic
[0:27:58] HumungaaDungaa: if you cant beat their parse dispel their buffs right?
[0:28:00] panjack13: Yeah I feel like, as in real life, most wow players are pretty normal
[0:28:22] hellsingzero: Yeah for SOD i jumped to pve and its relaxing
[0:29:10] nillgren: And since streaming they can now see the reaction

[3:54:18] Magnoks: salvation is chill tho
[3:54:21] dd_lee: @mythanos I will say that is the reason people speedrun in classic raids. Because all classic contents are beatable so farming will become stale after a while.
[3:54:41] Alidhemkebab: What is the main reason that alliance naxxramas speedruns are so much faster than horde?
[3:55:03] R_GraM_: better players n bigger margin for error
[3:55:22] R_GraM_: n cheeky paladin pulls/skips
