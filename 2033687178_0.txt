[0:33:34] DashzTV: I dont believe the riot mmo is real
[0:33:43] ectocantaim: we will all be dead before riot mmo comes out relax

[0:34:02] itsmagyks: its not a banger

[0:34:08] mujjating: good vid
[0:34:12] jotun90: @Razzin_ Its about vanilla rfw, not gonna excite Max I think
[0:34:14] ruzzlestwitch: its pretty good
[0:34:14] alarkin: I mean there has to be a non zero chance at this point the riot mmo just gets shelved right
[0:34:20] ruzzlestwitch: about vanilla not current though

[0:34:44] lathander557: I mean if it's Preach it's gonna be turbo Echo slanted naturally
[0:34:49] glitsmonk: 2006 KEKW
[0:34:50] seamuscg: Bedge
[0:34:58] Viertis: Its not bad, its nice to see how unhinged RFW was back then, and the history he goes over is fun to hear
[0:35:09] smolderdaddyuwu: saw that vid, echo aint even mentioned >...>
[0:35:11] itsmagyks: Back when TMsean was roaming the streets unsupervised
[0:35:12] Taytor: Exorsus Hryja KEKW
[0:35:29] Viertis: TLDR; EU guild wins because NA team gets hosed by KT not spawning for 4 days in a row
[0:35:32] Vanfinity: @Maximum just watched the part 2 of your heroic raid with that lichqueen chick...that was awesome! She's so great haha
[0:35:39] seamuscg: EARLY ACCESS WAYFINDER BOOBA Looking

[0:37:08] magicman133: GIGACHAD internal testing team 1 shot it
[0:37:16] Razzin_: the video shows how Nihilum won only because of lack of Blizzard support for raiders
[0:37:17] Roccocco: its combined
[0:37:21] Taytor: who knows they havn't said
[0:37:24] reggiepowa: combined makes sense
[0:37:25] kallisz: has to combined
[0:37:26] smolderdaddyuwu: different sets how I see it
[0:37:29] Viertis: OH that would be cool if different regions played with different sets, like does it really matter for S4?
[0:37:29] Taytor: I would assumed combined, but no confirmation
[0:37:36] nick08_wow: there will probably be an article later but 100% it is combined
[0:37:36] reggiepowa: we dont have asia votes though
[0:37:37] pnguinwow: seems weird to seperate it in the first place then
[0:37:41] kaldor_: what where the winner sets?
[0:37:42] Roccocco: on voting pols theres a column for combined
[0:37:44] chefdejour82: that would be a shit show
[0:37:45] Taytor: cause you needed to log into a bnet yeah
[0:37:46] itsmagyks: Is china even getting to vote
[0:37:47] Keppie__: ye login
[0:37:47] Kanklz: The forums don't work that way
[0:37:49] timmayb166: why wouldn’t they just have it combined to begin with
[0:37:49] nick08_wow: different forums. You cant vote on the other regions forums
[0:37:51] Egzeqtor: ye it was tied to characters
[0:37:54] kallisz: yeah you had to be logged in
[0:37:55] iWender: Can we demand a recount?!
[0:37:56] alejandro7com: Looks like the regions are debating how to play, but Twitch chat has already combined their wit!
[0:38:01] tehKrazeee: Data collection too
[0:38:06] ShellyBeansGaming: ShellyBeansGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:38:09] tehKrazeee: Demographics etc
[0:38:10] kallisz: currently: na dumb
[0:38:23] Viertis: The voting is over, but I havent seen any links for the results
[0:38:34] reggiepowa: did asia region vote?
[0:38:37] NotD4k: just click the links i guess to see %s
[0:39:02] m1lkman10: I think a lot of people are probably just voting for how they felt during that tier
[0:39:19] WolfgangAmpersand: Otherway can happen too, getting nerfed.
[0:39:33] Tsaebahcus007: @Maximum hey max, what do u think is the best DH resource to learn the class?
[0:39:35] nick08_wow: well then they didnt understand the premise of the vote
[0:39:37] Pyrrha_GG: voted for gameplay and prayge
[0:39:38] Tsaebahcus007: IV, Wowhead and Discord all say other things
[0:39:48] vickers624: Which specs truly relied on their tier sets @Maximum ?
[0:39:50] lathander557: I think tier sets should almost always be boring, it'd be better if fun gameplay came from good spec design and not band-aid armor sets
[0:39:50] NotD4k: if we get the nerfed versions, us boomies may be in shambles o7
[0:39:53] ginger_by_soul: Can only na and eu   vote? What's with the rest of the world ?
[0:39:53] Dandusis: EU aug got trolled
[0:39:54] Pinkupz: from what i read on forums alot of ppl are voting for transmog also
[0:40:04] Styxzthesage: Have you heard anything about a rework to the warlock and monk trees? Seems unlikely we'll get them with the tier stuff
[0:40:05] nick08_wow: @Pinkupz thats a seperate vote
[0:40:16] timmayb166: see the lions first playoff win in 32 years?
[0:40:17] Viertis: Transmog is seperate from tier bonus
[0:40:27] Viertis: So you could have S1 xmog but S3 powers
[0:40:29] Tsaebahcus007: Which SV hunter set won?
[0:40:37] Nox1o: it might be a seperate vote, but I voted on the transmogs based on power before i realised it. Probably happened the other way too
[0:40:38] CoffeeASAP: I wonder if you swap specs if it swaps to the winning tmog for that spec
[0:40:42] Sch1ey: Season 1 tmog is optional because lack of upgrade system made collecting harder
[0:40:45] Pyrrha_GG: @nick08_wow its not like more than half of the content creators (including max) were saying blizz wasnt gonna be able to balance it so can you blame them
[0:40:53] kaldor_: can you show the restoshaman set bonus?
[0:40:58] Sch1ey: Lore sch1eyFanfare
[0:41:08] Warmor100: max will we get a new catalyst charge on reset ?
[0:41:14] itsgamz: wdym we get gilneas
[0:41:21] ToxicLG: Feels like dragon flight was super front loaded with content which feels kinda bad
[0:41:23] gimmesomeganjaa: thoughts on M+ bosses not being tuned yet
[0:41:24] Pyrrha_GG: @Warmor100 everyweek now
[0:41:25] tyrone_shoelace: it has dragon riding everywhere
[0:41:26] RowanWeir: and theres also a .6 and .7 on the way
[0:41:29] Nox1o: at least it wont fuck balance for multiple years with something like aug LUL
[0:41:33] reszyy_: destro lock needs a fast talent tree rework
[0:41:33] Viertis: @Warmor100 Yes, and youll get 1 catalyst weekly now
[0:41:36] surpriseparty20: Npc dungeons
[0:41:38] reggiepowa: fury for sure
[0:41:39] Consor: The BM tier bonus is neck and neck
[0:41:39] 3V3R357: fury war
[0:41:40] Taytor: Arcane mage was

[0:41:55] Arisolo: @maximum WW has a different winner on Na and EU
[0:41:58] WolfgangAmpersand: Arms Warrior  is pretty much a Gameplay vs Power between S1 and S3
[0:41:58] MeisterChiefX: bm was close
[0:42:02] Dandusis: Aug in EU got trolled to S2
[0:42:03] 3V3R357: those are votes from like 5 days
[0:42:19] TinyDansonMan: no
[0:42:20] Drax_1224: no
[0:42:21] reggiepowa: other way around

[0:42:25] gali5656: opposite i think
[0:42:26] cyborgnoodlexd: nope
[0:42:26] MeisterChiefX: reverse
[0:42:26] smolderdaddyuwu: sure
[0:42:27] Niiol__: 2 different builds
[0:42:27] ShadowDuelist21: s3 plays annihilator
[0:42:28] vanquishq8: the other way
[0:42:28] figgy640: s3 is a snoozefest
[0:42:29] lol_kronuss: definitely not right?
[0:42:33] Seakorv: na 4Head
[0:42:34] Nox1o: wasnt s2 the big hits with bloodthrist or smthg?
[0:42:36] w4cki: nice try
[0:42:40] Drax_1224: S3 appeals to the casual player more
[0:42:40] Thdlock: rember to vote s2 aug to fuck over aug chat
[0:42:42] sardow90: S3 Fury is annialator build which most warriors hate
[0:42:42] lol_kronuss: s3 is annihilator ppl generally dont like that i think
[0:42:46] WolfgangAmpersand: @Nox1o yup
[0:42:46] mrduckytom: because na are overachievers? :p
[0:42:49] Brewmaster_Holsten: a mystery, why would NA indeed?
[0:42:49] cyborgnoodlexd: season 3 is easier to play
[0:42:50] goldengrubate: Check your critcale notes @maximum
[0:42:52] TheBroCrow: cause USA hates augs
[0:42:53] Keppie__: S3 is the 2 button rotation
[0:42:53] manlyhandles: WideTHD
[0:42:53] timmayb166: season 2 was more powerful lol
[0:42:55] Drax_1224: its legit 2 buttons
[0:42:56] smolderdaddyuwu: cause na is stupidf?
[0:43:00] reggiepowa: yeah you dont press raging blow with s3 set
[0:43:07] ShaggySummers: How much do you think you influenced these votes? @Maximum
[0:43:11] Nox1o: to be fair s2 and s3 are really even in EU votes
[0:43:25] tehKrazeee: I wanted S2, S3 is clunky for me
[0:43:32] fazulo21: @Maximum loved the poddyC man, I don't have time for retail but it's supa cool to listen to the in depth analysis of the game <3
[0:43:44] reggiepowa: yeah s2 playstyle is way better
[0:43:47] Style0mat: facts
[0:43:47] scorgie1994: AM should be baseline
[0:43:53] yrp01: YES!
[0:43:59] UnheardGrace: I just like how much the fury cds line up without anger management
[0:44:04] AJbgodx: current fury is actually really fun, prob most enjoyable fury since MoP
[0:44:15] RaderTader: RaderTader subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 45 month streak! and two zig zags
[0:44:19] alejandro7com: Looks like the chat is buzzing with different classes and specs! It's like a virtual battleground of opinions and preferences. I wonder if we'll see a friendly duel between the Arcane Mage, Resto Shaman, Fury Warrior, and Fury Warrior. Who will come out on top? Let the battle begin!
[0:44:21] Freezy2371: EU EZ
[0:44:24] tehKrazeee: Yup, but of course people screwed it up
[0:44:26] glitsmonk: do warriors normally prefer arms seasons or fury seasons?
[0:44:30] iiamBaro: EU is always right
[0:44:36] 3V3R357: those are old vote numbers, s2 is winning
[0:44:36] Drax_1224: i am
[0:44:39] yellzz: s2 won
[0:44:41] magicman133: HUH
[0:44:41] powerradezero: I AM
[0:44:43] Sch1ey: People play war?
[0:44:44] tehKrazeee: I'm pretty salty. Another 6 months of this garbage
[0:44:57] HakiThunderFox: both our warrior players are going to play arms only because of the set selection LuL
[0:45:13] lol_kronuss: the only problem with S2 is that it kinda requires a WA to track your bloodthirst crit but thats about it
[0:45:14] yellzz: EU 10.5k votes and 55 s2 35% s3
[0:45:18] EldritchMammoth: click it they show the votes now
[0:45:21] Niiol__: 55 s2 35 s3
[0:45:23] powerradezero: 55 39
[0:45:25] null_sheen: NA Dentge
[0:45:35] Thruthh: @Maximum  mostly ppl from NA  are wanting S3, and caused quite big drama in warrior discord, because NA just wanted to vote S3 because of ppl didnt want EU to be right, thats fucking insane
[0:45:37] nick08_wow: saved from the EU KEKW
[0:45:38] mrduckytom: eu saved the day
[0:45:43] mstr_shake: @Maximum I know you moved on from the hockey convo but, were you unbelievably sore after your first game back? I just played soccer again and I hurt
[0:45:47] reszyy_: ppl play warrior?
[0:45:52] glitsmonk: @Thruthh based
[0:45:57] tangysauce1: NA OMEGALUL
[0:46:01] Nearlyinsane: there no shot they are gonna balance 2 out of 3 sets cause different regions want different things
[0:46:01] Consor: you can see the EU vote count if you log out of B net @Maximum
[0:46:06] tehKrazeee: lawdy I pray S2 wins somehow
[0:46:22] Drax_1224: roughly 600 vote win for S2 net right?
[0:46:22] glitsmonk: HUH
[0:46:22] alejandro7com: Looks like the votes are in, and the drama is real! NA Dentge, EU, and the battle for supremacy – it's like a Twitch version of Game of Thrones! 😄
[0:46:24] Nox1o: just do some lobbying Max to make sure
[0:46:49] reggiepowa: yep that sucks
[0:46:49] FuraiEU: Can you check boomkin votes? @maximum
[0:46:58] ShadowDuelist21: and its ResidentSleeper
[0:47:04] ShadowDuelist21: no raging blow is a snoozefest
[0:47:05] Viertis: I wonder how/if they handled the votes when this first went live where it didnt require you to log in to vote. I put like 500 votes towards the demon fire channel tier set for destro locks just to hear our lock complain about it
[0:47:07] Lenzoface: voting for S3 is 3Head S2 gang
[0:47:09] NotD4k: augs <-- Dentge
[0:47:10] Lenzoface: Fury
[0:47:14] Consor: you can see the EU vote count if you log out of B net @Maximum Im on NA and i can see the numbers
[0:47:19] sardow90: Warrior Back to ripping treat on every pack WOOO
[0:47:21] Oracle_WoW: all those opinions are incorrect according to half of skyhold @Maximum

[0:48:10] Drax_1224: most of skyhold are brainlets anyways
[0:48:11] xhriiis: class discords LUL
[0:48:12] Syrjyys: @Arcinatos Doubt, couldn't vote all sets destro
[0:48:12] reszyy_: fuck aug

[0:48:56] psylic: psylic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[0:49:05] eyeztea: we should have all voted season 1 for aug so they just delete it

[0:49:09] Thdlock: I VOTED 2 BASED
[0:49:16] xhriiis: season 3 is also winning in eu

[0:49:21] puneet911: i voted 2 baseg
[0:49:22] brosciencegym: @Maximum  Season 2 is good because we are ending this expansion Kappa
[0:49:23] shadwosw: where the fu ck is delete aug option
[0:49:23] frauditssb: @Maximum People just dont like to manage 4 presciences at once, thats why people are voting season 2. Its less mental strain if you just rando 2 of your EM
[0:49:30] lol_kronuss: pretty sure ppl are voting S2 to grief it lol
[0:49:36] cruzzxv: Season 2 voter baseg

[0:49:45] vnasty117: ret pala was close
[0:49:47] StickyTreez: ret s2 and s3 was close
[0:49:51] TheunGaming: resto shaman was fairly close, but the eu vote was pretty s1 favored
[0:49:51] EldritchMammoth: windwalker right now is s1/s2 at 35% each
[0:49:55] NotD4k: season 1 won for sure
[0:49:56] KurllyxD: think ww was pretty close
[0:50:08] Nox1o: balance feels scuffed since the nerfed s1 reads horrible
[0:50:10] NotD4k: but the blue thingys say "updated" so i think its the nerfed one o7
[0:50:16] alejandro7com: Looks like the chat is getting heated! Can we all agree to 'stop the count' on the arguments and just enjoy the stream? 😄
[0:50:22] manlyhandles: gamergummies i stand with gromnak on moonkins
[0:50:24] Tsaebahcus007: I've seen a lot of boomies pop up in high keys atm
[0:50:30] Shamanly: Season 2 and 3 were full massive, season 1 was the most interactive and fun
[0:50:37] Shamanly: passive*
[0:50:50] NotD4k: just playstyle
[0:50:51] magicman133: @alejandro7com no
[0:51:01] Bluuxx: the ret pally vote is very different from EU to NA
[0:51:07] NotD4k: no s1 is better on playstyle by far, we play weaver with it
[0:51:09] surpriseparty20: Most moonkin players are completely clueless

[1:08:25] thesibus: thats not really true? its an engine port. its not going very well but its not comparable to overwatch
[1:08:25] mansahabib: Valorant is not a good game, people are hypnitysed into liking the game. Like coffee
[1:08:29] goldengrubate: Pretty much yeah they both exist just as engine upgrades
[1:08:30] emsy: valorant owns
[1:08:32] miraagex: @Aessari 3-5 years probably KEKW
[1:08:33] Squats3: @Maximum what sucks about CS2 the most is that valve makes a new game once every 15 years. so this hurts their rep pretty good

[1:09:46] itsmagyks: Poker is a card game with stakes, gambling is giving away your money.

[1:10:54] JWallace: Warcraft rumble
[1:10:55] TotallyNotRaien: thats when i get bored and quit
[1:10:57] miraagex: @Aessari poker is a game about reading your opponents. it has little to do with the actual hand
[1:11:01] Sanctos304: same as drug dealers
[1:11:05] ciggyman: SCAMBA
[1:11:09] BigTrout3: Warcraft rumble and gold Sadge

[1:11:19] Nickystr1x: @JukeboxHey i've heard that THD is the HR guy for Liquid, so he handles any disputes
[1:11:26] Pyrrha_GG: warcraft rumble was real fun till you get to like level 18 ish and progression takes ages
[1:11:29] 22snooze: what game is he talking about?
[1:11:35] Aessari: @miraagex both
[1:11:37] Lars_Keizer: China actually very recently banned a significant account of those transactions and incentives to spend more
[1:11:41] Faraday5001: raidy shady

[1:11:52] Futura_F: had me in a chokehold
[1:11:54] HakiThunderFox: lost ark is goated, too bad its got such bad gear progression#
[1:11:56] miraagex: @Aessari idk, i've seen MasterClass by Negreanu and I trust him more than u
[1:11:57] Nox1o: ive probably spent 20 bucks in my life on phone games and I still think about it and feel like an idiot for doing it
[1:12:06] itsvizjira: epic seven for the best round based pvp ever
[1:12:08] alejandro7com: Someone tell me the secret level where you find scratch-offs in your car, I've been playing on the wrong difficulty setting!
[1:12:10] Nox1o: ive wasted money way worse and just forget
[1:12:12] Flameisthename: I spent too much money on that game lol
[1:12:12] Aessari: ok :D
[1:12:12] MourningSage94: max do you know if the guide posted on the liquid youtube for tindral a few days ago is going to be fixed, some of the info in it seems wrong?
[1:12:15] miraagex: @Aessari he says poker is pure math and psycology
[1:12:16] reszyy_: FGO was lit
[1:12:17] Voodoodippin: ngl Archero is addicting af
[1:12:19] Schlafiyo: @CruuuLest and on pokemon cards and on fifa etc :D
[1:12:19] wjallaa: club penguin on top
[1:12:24] Jarlan23: the only f2p game i spent money on was marvel heroes. miss that game
[1:12:26] JakeParkbench: LA has top combat and boss, shit everything else
[1:12:32] Madgeneto: have you seen throne and liberty?
[1:12:35] HakiThunderFox: @Nox1o I bought the diablo immortal season pass.
[1:12:39] Aessari: @miraagex yes, and math = cards. You still play around the percentage, aside from mindgames :)
[1:12:51] mybootyisasnack: i spent 17k on genshin and i dont even play it anymore. its been dead to me for two years now
[1:13:04] JakeParkbench: True, I can hear the honing fail right now
[1:13:05] CruuuLest: @Maximum fun fact, a high up politician in Austria had 3500$ CoC expenses which his party paid for KEKW
[1:13:13] CruuuLest: *ex high up
[1:13:14] Aessari: @mybootyisasnack monkaS
[1:13:17] HakiThunderFox: holy moly. I dont even have 17k to spend
[1:13:31] ectocantaim: i miss my lost ark mage Sadge
[1:13:34] Arcinatos: @CruuuLest thats a lot of coc for one guy
[1:13:45] HakiThunderFox: cockroach go brrr Sadge
[1:13:46] miraagex: @JakeParkbench wow has the best combat in all mmorpgs ever released (at least from hardcore players perspective who loves challenge and billion buttons)
[1:13:49] xhriiis: it was so boring doing homework on 6 characters end me
[1:14:02] Svarok_NA: i tried to go back and play, but without a solid catchup all the shit is basically solo
[1:14:03] Stu720: Max should play monster hunter world
[1:14:06] JakeParkbench: @miraagex I just wish WoW had more impact or feel
[1:14:07] triggeredhappy666: what headset are you using right now? looking for a new one
[1:14:11] splashz0r: max are you gonna try out last epoch arpg
[1:14:12] Dankh40: garf
[1:14:13] Jarlan23: you ever play those clicker games? i get hardcore addicted when i start one so i stay away from them now
[1:14:14] Arcinatos: same
[1:14:20] slowfetch: wildstar!!!
[1:14:21] guynormally: it's the best of any game period
[1:14:22] Ancine: gcd is too high
[1:14:26] Ok_Kingston: destiny gunplay owns hard
[1:14:30] Jicsa: Wildstar O.O
[1:14:32] eyxx: the class design in this game fucks hard
[1:14:36] miraagex: @JakeParkbench what makes you feel it doesnt have impact?
[1:14:37] Flipeled: Wildstar the true goat
[1:14:38] HakiThunderFox: the variety within the class itself is also awesome
[1:14:48] Jaborba: doing your rotation while jumping is so fluid
[1:14:48] i_cassius: the matrix online ?
[1:14:53] awesomeoohh: WoW's movement and combat are why it hasn't been touched
[1:14:53] Voodoodippin: Take it easy with big words im gonna take is disrespect
[1:14:58] Voodoodippin: as*
[1:14:59] Onyo1337: what day is it ?
[1:15:01] Lars_Keizer: After wow every MMO just feel clunky and not fluid
[1:15:06] Cellblood: ye wow combat is better than any other mmo ever not close
[1:15:09] itsrickardo: @Maximum clearly you never played everquest smh
[1:15:19] Cellblood: ff14 is better now but it used to be way worse
[1:15:21] xpungax: neverwinter online has one of the best combats I've seen
[1:15:22] ubba90: FF just seems to have way to much visuals for not as much actually hapening. but it does look cool
[1:15:28] fzybny: Nah, the FF combat issue is the horrible net code.
[1:15:28] Jarlan23: maybe it was my class in ff14 but i didnt like the rotation. it was static like a combo system
[1:15:29] Svarok_NA: wow combat is a rock concert ff is more of a orchestra
[1:15:32] surpriseparty20: FF combat was decent . Fights were fun
[1:15:33] just_ie: @maximum are you concerned that they arent doing any large tuning for 10.2.5?
[1:15:38] castermaain: The class design is worse in FF but the tradeoff is better balance
[1:15:52] itsvizjira: very intentional
[1:15:54] Faraday5001: @castermaain FF is far from balanced
[1:15:55] JakeParkbench: @miraagex Its a mix of effects and sound mostly, like you can set a nuke off in other games and it feels big. But also you need to turn of other players effect since its too much.
[1:15:58] Jarlan23: yeah i hate that
[1:16:03] Spinerek: i like that
[1:16:10] HakiThunderFox: its very easy to figure out what you did wrong in your rotation
[1:16:15] MajorKusa: RDM is like that with small procs
[1:16:15] Spinerek: procs are meh
[1:16:17] castermaain: @castermaain It's better balanced than WOW, of course it's not perfect
[1:16:21] Sorin__: god i love procs
[1:16:25] Nombbs: @Maximum I came to wow at the beginning of last month from being a ultimate raider in FF. I will say my journey to AoTC was more fun than anything in FF cause the way combat is
[1:16:29] nick08_wow: dynamic is fun af
[1:16:30] Sorin__: give me buttons that are gambling
[1:16:30] gretriku: dancer feels the most like a wow class
[1:16:31] MrMangou07: What do you think about the addon Hekili?
[1:16:31] FZeroDMX: FF14 classes are extremely rigid and all operate on the same timers.
[1:16:35] ChefTinyT: that was my only complaint in ffxiv is the dps rotation is so strict
[1:16:36] ViviLouF: @Spinerek mains rifle mechanist
[1:16:37] alejandro7com: @mybootyisasnack 17k on genshin? You could have bought a car with that money. Or a house. Or a small island. FeelsBadMan
[1:16:39] Oracle_WoW: werent a lot of wow rotations like that back in the day?
[1:16:40] Jicsa: bm hunter kekw
[1:16:41] Pyrrha_GG: ret
[1:16:42] ubba90: none
[1:16:43] Vaiilz: 0 ?
[1:16:44] ChefTinyT: i loved playing bard
[1:16:44] Spinerek: @ViviLouF Zase ...
[1:16:46] shinta__: procs are dopamine good
[1:16:47] Dritlukt: balance druid?
[1:16:49] TheOGNubz: Storm enhancemetn shaman maybe? lol
[1:16:49] Lars_Keizer: Enhance shaman procs Kreygasm
[1:16:50] drunktaco1: fury
[1:16:51] ChefTinyT: and dancer
[1:16:52] ubba90: even healers get procs
[1:16:55] ChefTinyT: cause of the procs
[1:16:56] Fynale: aug don't have a ton of procs
[1:16:59] timmayb166: bm hunter
[1:17:00] miraagex: WoW within itself is very different. Compare a simple classe like BM/Devo and ADHD outlaw/enha. I can see some players enjoying one playstylebut totally vomit from another, let alone other games
[1:17:01] Arcinatos: antorus dh BOOBA
[1:17:04] misfitstv1: destro warlock?
[1:17:07] ciggyman: procs hit diffy
[1:17:08] nick08_wow: assa rogue comes close since ambush replaces mut now but your rpocs from how many cp you get would still vary your rotation
[1:17:08] Cruzitow: bm
[1:17:11] ciggyman: proc a bevy
[1:17:13] Baamsta: ret for the most part hammer of wrath procs
[1:17:19] itsvizjira: it also hard gaps casual players
[1:17:27] gambleragain: Idk about easier to understand but surely much better @Maximum
[1:17:27] Bareno: @Fynale we do have essence burst procs tho, not super rotationally changing but it is there
[1:17:28] odawgxd: scripted rotation is the only reason why i didnt continue play ff tbh
[1:17:29] JakeParkbench: Its procs and the talent passives, FF14 doesnt have any variation for the most part, just play the class as designed
[1:17:32] Voodoodippin: ST balance druid can be pretty linear at times
[1:17:36] honeychonker: FF also has 1-2-3 combos but they also dont have trinkets, talents, etc
[1:17:48] honeychonker: The FF community is also INFINITELY more cringe than the WoW community
[1:17:51] Kramoune: @misfitstv1 destro got a lot of portal procs
[1:17:51] Standy94: I don't love that some wow specs feel like they require weakauras
[1:18:15] xxMaverick: triple on use this tier Pepega
[1:18:16] Peeachy0: Peeachy0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 3 month streak! nice

[1:18:23] Sutech0605: yep
[1:18:26] swervo61: True
[1:18:28] alejandro7com: @ViviLouF Zase ...
[1:18:33] HakiThunderFox: @honeychonker screw 1-2-3 combos. Im not wasting 2 good keybinds to have a filler thats slightly stronger. Combo addon saved me
[1:18:33] Bareno: isn't it powered by 2014 hardware? KEKW
[1:18:37] Molekular_Man: BatChest
[1:18:37] magicman133: its good for really basic games
[1:18:39] JakeParkbench: Nintendo needs to just make games for better consoles at this point LuL
[1:18:40] Bareno: or something around that year range
[1:18:43] ubba90: the fact that PSP is better than the switch is kinda sad
[1:18:44] Lars_Keizer: @maximum for me every other MMO feels like you're lagging almost. They lack fluidity. Like you'd cast a spec and it's almost like you're locked in animations, or a certain angle or whatever
[1:18:47] xpungax: Switch is only for Nintendo games
[1:18:48] Diazanite: nintendo has been stuck in the year 2000 for 40 years.
[1:18:55] glitsmonk: new fronk tweet
[1:18:59] yungbeex: where can i find the final voting of the tierset thing
[1:19:03] Vaiilz: nah im a graphic whore ngl xD
[1:19:04] miraagex: Flappy Bird was the legend
[1:19:06] Sutech0605: but 15 fps on some games is too much :d
[1:19:09] miraagex: Gameplay >>>>> everything else

[1:19:16] bayazijr: graphics makes a lot of games just... laggy
[1:19:28] FZeroDMX: @ubba90 PSP is better than most things the PSP owns

[1:19:47] Vaiilz: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:19:50] MajorKusa: lmao

[1:20:08] pepesm0kes: @fronkacean Clap
[1:20:10] miraagex: oh my god
[1:20:12] payloon: @Maximum have u seen the non verbal drama
[1:20:17] Onyo1337: so good KEKW
[1:20:18] seamuscg: lmao the dragonriding clip
[1:20:19] Vaiilz: so stupid xD
[1:20:29] glitsmonk: a day after his team disbanded smh
[1:20:31] Onyo1337: do you even know the first football player? xdd
[1:20:38] toique: whats the lore between dratnos and fronk??
[1:20:43] smolderdaddyuwu: @payloon yeah. he hates it. aint funny
[1:20:44] guynormally: 30fps xdd
[1:20:44] honeychonker: yeah but Switch has Pokemon and Metroid Prime
[1:20:53] malnourish_: w take, my king
[1:20:54] mybootyisasnack: i just hate how tiny the buttons are it feels like a fake toy
[1:20:55] pbnj_kills: "look at these graphics" shows fully rendered cutscene
[1:20:55] JakeParkbench: Oh man, Blood bourne on PS4 vibes
[1:21:01] Qubuuuu: graphics doesnt matter, just look at valheim how hard it popped with "bad graphics"
[1:21:02] gambleragain: its content
[1:21:04] Standy94: What key is this?
[1:21:06] Fishamin: i want to play wow but none of the classes feel fun to me. it sucks.
[1:21:06] thenateo2: its good stuff
[1:21:07] majestictaco0: Im still recoiling from the disappointment of how shit pokemon scarlet/violet ran Sadge
[1:21:08] Lars_Keizer: Nintendo has a few incredible titles but the hardware is dog
[1:21:09] vallinae: james stood up for his team mates its fine
[1:21:09] TheBroCrow: Madge but max, nintendo was literally my childhood 30 years ago so I have to defend them on social media

[1:55:53] risettefreya: real incel housewives of cringecity
[1:55:54] littlegooaatt: still doesnt justify a grown man muting himself like a babyback bitch

[1:56:53] Slensch: god damn drama is rare in retail nowadays
[1:56:54] mc_chrisco: IMPORTANT TO NOTE: in the week before they were flat out not using sweep on purpose and THEN elle got flamed for not sweeping
[1:56:56] kallisz: im having the issue with the no responsibility taken
[1:56:57] RyersonTV: what is this take, he muted himself
[1:56:57] mkam225: buds? maybe not the best term LUL
[1:56:58] durcu: nerf was the one who was mad first though
[1:56:59] SupaCoopa2688: what if this was all just a psyop to make people think their team fell apart prior to MDI
[1:56:59] Pyrrha_GG: i mean nerf flaming elle for the cheat
[1:57:00] AJbgodx: tbh I think the whole issue is nerfs reaction after the key
[1:57:00] NotD4k: #ad
[1:57:01] stressedattorney: how many times do u have to do a key to know when to dodge
[1:57:02] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: man 5 mins ago this drama was lame af, now its interesting
[1:57:02] Garzag_: because he is shitting on elle for literally anything
[1:57:03] risettefreya: @zoamonk yeah, it just makes me wonder why the people in the drama don’t get paid then
[1:57:03] magicman133: @magicman133 he started it by getting mad about the overlap
[1:57:05] Itankarenas: I feel like if it's known he's first stun, then it doesn't need to be called
[1:57:06] MitsuhideTenkai: He's always doing this towards Elle bro
[1:57:07] goop: well this team historically has a big problem admitting fault
[1:57:08] professor_cullman: Max not understand how free a 30WC is
[1:57:10] mc_chrisco: so of course man is going to be thinking of sweeping more

[1:57:34] lathandra1990: I think they're missing the context of jpc dying on the previous maggot pull
[1:57:39] Garzag_: we are all 30 year old men OMEGALUL
[1:57:39] dorki: its way too much for the tank
[1:57:41] crickyb24: @goop Based
[1:57:43] Metapong: nerf so quick to lash out when the pull hadn't even gone bad yet

[1:57:56] yelp26: Idk man the pull before he said "can I get one fucking heal" that will provoke a response like the ellesmere one
[1:57:57] kallisz: he is, he flamed his team. took no responsibility. he was a bitch, said some shit. went full childish idiot

[2:01:35] magicman133: growl's opinion - only ellesmere is wrong everyone else is good
[2:01:38] kheim: Allright Dr. Phil, what is the conclusion?
[2:01:38] Leinax: honestly i dont understand this guys point, if he is saying that it s is a pug key so why are they on his back, why did nerf say first stop overlapping etc if its just a pug key, the logic doesnt make sense
[2:01:40] sukoWoW: nerf wasn't at his keyboard when james said that
[2:01:42] Hred5: @goop LMFAOO
[2:01:42] Varae__: Yeah but he's like 10 minutes into the silent treatment at that poitn
[2:01:44] hivplus__: @goop xdd

[2:02:00] Hred5: nerf said that he took his earbuds out. didn’t hear James. he also said he has no issue with anyone
[2:02:01] RaxxFPS: What Growl don't get is that nerf should just say, this is stressful and I'm sorry. The way nerf handled It is what screwed this whole thing over.

[2:03:24] Warptime: growl is right but this doesnt happen at all without the mental boom, and if you let that happen then its just unfortunately what you deserve. you have to be a good human and communicate, and if you dont an apology has to happen. that behavior is so poor

[2:05:04] NDRandell: Nerf is a fucking child, his defense for shitting on ellesmere on this key was "I shit on ellesmere every day"
[2:05:05] Pandho: growl is the real victim here
[2:05:10] TheRealDeo_: i thought it was kinda screwed up how Nerf said, "Man I hate playing with this healer sometimes." When the group has been quite close for awhile
[2:05:11] kallisz: this is also so american, youre so prideful
[2:05:12] c3rby_: Every time growl goes on a rant its chat hate

[2:05:20] Slapsstick: I know a lot of people out of game who still dont know how to take responsibility for things
[2:05:21] artorias2142: I have to do it ALOT as I talk to my mates like shit, I apologise and we go again
[2:05:22] catechism__: this says a lot about growl lol
[2:05:23] Marpell: @fronkacean and jpc was at nerf?

[2:06:06] amperegames: zero-fault mentality
[2:06:07] cheados: it's a maturity thing, humility is a rare trait
[2:06:08] spivet: i think growl is describing a nott great culture and ideally in your team or job or whatever you definitely do not want it to be that way.
[2:06:08] joshjarx: Max is the boss of liquid and Nerf is the boss of Growl
[2:06:08] luxationwow: Guess growl is fully recovered from shit talking echo and wants a lil more publicity

[2:06:16] Avarizz: i think its easier to hide in a 20 man group when your mad, then if ur in a m+ key
[2:06:18] brunbanan: growl is baser
[2:06:18] bhanter: sounds like your average discord friend group tbh
[2:06:18] gnomak: max is in the managerial class
[2:06:18] chubbytheboi: Can someone recap for me what happened in a sentence?
[2:06:18] Theliahh: Echo M+ 100%
[2:06:19] combobulous: Hate & Discontent for life, leave the feelings at the gate
[2:06:20] holtrop: theres so many groups that seem very toxic on the outside but in some way its their fucked up lovelanguage KEKW
[2:06:25] tphuman: why is this being narrowed down into oh it’s a keys thing or a m+ group with success issue, the guy didn’t know how to react to stress and frustration and his teammate was fed up of that after it happening a lot and this was the straw that broke the camels back
[2:06:25] IrishFightX: Max is the boss of liquid and Nerf is the boss of Growl
[2:06:28] Jimmo24: @Maximum we did keys with a guy for 2 years, he was a dickhead and rage quit a key over a butt pull and never came back
[2:06:30] magicman133: pete is spitting one of THE points of all time
[2:06:31] GoAskAliceVAL: the bar is on the floor
[2:06:32] mkam225: ???

[2:06:33] kallisz: elle did that
[2:06:34] Jag303: this is why i follow dorki but not growl
[2:06:35] GoAskAliceVAL: its buried
[2:06:36] NotD4k: what?
[2:06:36] thenateo2: being normal isnt a high standard KEKW
[2:06:37] Varae__: Accepting responsibility after you cool down is literally baseline behavior
[2:06:38] littlegooaatt: god growl is such a beta male
[2:06:39] Leinax: I think this guy has come in and made it worse lol, he has shown 1 side of an arguement and not offered or accepted much of any other side lol.
[2:06:39] neriumttv: ad
[2:06:39] glitsmonk: does anyone know what bro is cooking?
[2:06:45] awesomeoohh: Apologizing feels like insta good as fuck honestly, like the weight of anger just leaves immediately. I highly recommend to everyone to learn the power of saying "I'm sorry"
[2:06:47] GoAskAliceVAL: elles literally apologized after the key
[2:06:47] miraagex: @thenateo2 actually yes as of recent 5-10 years
[2:06:48] Hred5: @Leinax KEKW
[2:06:50] yshkk: I don't think you drop a bomb mid key and just go away. Finish it like a grown up, and take it after - preferably offf stream
[2:06:51] luxationwow: in the moment??? he just double downed on it in chat and said what he did was perfectly reasonable lol
[2:06:52] Thowarr: Everyone is holding him to adult standards. Growl says that's too high. Check.
[2:06:53] sleepyboycody: growl 100% right
[2:06:54] grimmakyr: if you wouldnt take that line and say, im wrong sorry. can we move on, you aint an adult.
[2:06:55] bebincalicious: blud thinks he's figured out life while playing WoW 24/7
[2:06:56] stonehaens: who's the guy on voice? he's 100% right
[2:06:56] Pechorin333: how does chat think growl is being unreasonable
[2:06:57] Sorin__: nerf was being shitty immediately before that happened "what gcd were you pressing?"
[2:06:57] Hred5: growl is just out here defending his friend KEKW
[2:06:58] IAttackYou: Growl is chat
[2:06:59] sleepyboycody: most people gonna ego that or just log off
[2:07:00] basic55: the apology usually is a next day thing if both parties are angry
[2:07:01] mozerra: be nice to each other's peepoSad
[2:07:01] xarker1: i just came in here and i dont even know what were talking about

[2:07:14] Nox1o: We havent even seen nerfs POV, how are we getting blamed xdd
[2:07:20] TruckBomb: @Maximum elles make mistake after mistake and always justifies like he did there never mans up to his mistake and if just builds where it happen and nerf snapped
[2:07:23] magicman133: growl is out here saying lots of WORDS blud
[2:07:27] nightbreeze93: of course chat would act properly EZ
[2:07:27] Madgeneto: @thenateo2 if you think the best case scenario is just being "normal" you either live in a utopia or you're detached from reality
[2:07:27] ShaggySummers: 6 ads yay
[2:07:28] Theliahh: xdd
[2:07:30] sorenkje: xdd
[2:07:33] joshjarx: elle was the bigger person. defending the non verbal childish behavior is wild to me. glazing hard when he would get non verbaled too in a heartbeat lol
[2:07:34] Ampped87: Hard to think straight when tilted
[2:07:34] rushfanatiic: what happened ?
[2:07:34] Hred5: Kappa
[2:07:39] dhcellaena: I mean they've been having little arguments like this constantly for months
[2:07:39] sleepyboycody: without a doubt
[2:07:40] Diazanite: when you have an ego it is near impossible to admit youre wrong, say sorry and be genuine about it.
[2:07:40] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: im thinking this is the best thing that happened to m+ since TGP

[2:26:08] crickyb24: @Koben_The Hopeful is Echo spy and trying to destroy NA from within
[2:26:09] Celestial990: @royaloates high keys can be hard due to needing to do really good pulls and doing a lot of dmg. instead right now it's needing to stop 10 casts every 5 seconds every pull and living boss 1 shots all the time
[2:26:12] CashmereWizard: fated lame copout

[2:26:28] ZACKandATTACK: @Maximum I feel like the damage increase on keys should be capped at some point, to avoid the 1 shot issues. The difficulty should be in doing the biggest pulls possible to play the timer

[2:27:21] BadManners_: im to lazy for that KEKW
[2:27:22] Ellesmere_Gaming: seasonal affix, only one weekly affix, shorter dungeons, less one shot mechanics more emphasis put on throughput, less mechanics on trash mobs
[2:27:28] kitty0chi: i think you need a tettles and naguura pov besides dorkis
[2:27:30] Warptime: cannot livestream it because BIG EVOKER woulda heard about it

[2:27:39] laetuss: New episode, available nowhere EZ
[2:27:40] hucking: they should stop recycling dungeons so much imo, 1 or 2 dungeons is fine but half the dungeons in a season (and 75% in this season) is way too much i want new dungeons. I also want them to make dungeons that are actually fun to play and dont have a million trash mobs that have 1shot mechanics

[2:33:15] goop: @Boreall he has to establish thats hes better than you before he makes his excuse
[2:33:15] miraagex: I have no idea how Gingi/Jay shotcal while playing MAGE
[2:33:16] Lungwen1: Echo
[2:33:16] IAttackYou: Truing
[2:33:16] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: he was still bitchin

[2:33:32] cannibalcanyon: YEP
[2:33:33] alexchopstix: gingi a beast
[2:33:33] ciggyman: they need a gingi
[2:33:34] fronkacean: except for me maybe
[2:33:35] oneygaming: i have a similar issue with my group. I have to shotcall as tank and sometimes thats not the best option in big pulls under pressure
[2:33:36] Aessari: 6 man m+
[2:33:36] fronkacean: im kinda goated like that
[2:33:37] glaceCS: glaceCS subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:33:40] Mipolol: GIGACHAD = Gin ji (no space)
[2:33:40] GabMoon__: They truelly need a GINGI
[2:33:40] BigTrout3: do the paint diagram again
[2:33:40] ItsSmashar: Gingis already at 150% so losing 50% is fine
[2:33:41] vanquishq8: Gingi
[2:33:42] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: everybody needs a gingi
[2:33:42] Thowarr: Then if you don't want to shot call anymore, or if it's too tough, step out. "I can't do this anymore, I'm stepping down"
[2:33:42] Lilurrn: 6th man M+ lets go
[2:33:44] ncg20: @Maximum Isnt that the same for raidleading too?
[2:33:47] pixlbunz: yeah... Gingi goated
[2:33:48] ciggyman: someone get in the lab and make a gingi
[2:33:49] grimmakyr: he's right, but he behaved like a bitch ^^. it wont change that fact
[2:33:49] spotteddoggo: SUCH AN NA TAKE
[2:33:49] Holyjudgee: Meeres & gingi do that so good
[2:33:52] enigmasvea: m+ needs a outside raidleader EZ
[2:33:52] Urdian: @Urdian i just came in thank you
[2:33:53] tobivel: Drjay
[2:33:56] sm0keo: Chatting no this guy
[2:34:03] DejavuNeony: just have tank do it they don't do anything TehePelo
[2:34:03] Riberson1: @fronkacean  GoatEmotey
[2:34:09] royaloates: people saying gingi... when hed def play some better if he could blinders his class ha
[2:34:09] ubba90: gingi and dabnel. yep best callers
[2:34:12] enigmasvea: new meta = a outside leader for m+ EZ
[2:34:13] SachroTV: time to get a 6th person for keys boys xdding
[2:34:14] TaterTacoTots: @tobivel the only thing he can do is get booted from teams KEKW
[2:34:18] alejandro7com: billy is a child of divorce
[2:34:19] Aizen_NP: i APReCIaTe YOU maX
[2:34:23] Boreall: @goop For real, I find it so hard to have empathy for his perspective when he's starting each statement with "Nobody understands me/I'm not the problem"
[2:34:28] erickalemaoo: nerf breathed helium gas?
[2:34:30] Zzekar: tbh echo calls are not only on gingi no? he is doing god work but diff ppl call diff shit and maybe thats why they fkin own while also pumping 99% logs
[2:34:32] goombacci: @fronkacean you got to cook fast; this drama is about to die in 2 days
[2:34:33] Canwestop: expecting an aug to shotcall OMEGALUL
[2:34:42] fronkacean: @goombacci itll be up on 3 minutes
[2:34:42] Canwestop: they can barely live
[2:34:43] dorki: u automatically have a 10-20% debuff by shotcalling
[2:34:44] bebincalicious: "Me" KEKW
[2:34:45] enigmasvea: so what youre saying is you should shotcall m+ outside of the dung Pog
[2:34:47] DejavuNeony: @Maximum why don't m+ pushers play with 6th caller? KEKW
[2:34:47] dorki: thats the best way to look at it
[2:34:52] goombacci: @goombacci hoily baseg
[2:34:56] Mattso45: I ran alot of keys with Hartlin in S1, he was so good and shot calling and playing it made me feel so bad.
[2:34:58] Madgeneto: CognitiveLoad
[2:34:59] holtrop: coggy l maxxed out
[2:35:02] Cakerinotv: so whats the best role in m+ to shotcall from, does it matter?
[2:35:07] Voyburke: Just play bm hunter
[2:35:08] dav1dk7: I believe in SL gingi once said, that DPS shotcaller is better than tanks, since tanking difficulty scales with key level and dealing damage is always the same
[2:35:10] enigmasvea: m+ needs a outside shotcaller EZ
[2:35:11] Alzarod: meeres is so insane
[2:35:14] dorki: ye m+ is too hard
[2:35:20] UsedRuggs: @Cakerinotv probably Aug lol
[2:35:25] Zzekar: @dorki for sure is not bigger then 10% .. on certain ppl atleast
[2:35:26] TheRealDeo_: meeres is sick
[2:35:28] chompster2111: On the topic of appreciating gingi make shoutout to mfs who can multiclass depending on what the team needs
[2:35:29] goop: @dorki xdd
[2:35:32] sinfusion: Chat is this guy using a voice changer?
[2:35:35] 0_____Kappa: 6th man when?
[2:35:35] Thowarr: Well Echo can call stuff and play efficiently, so...
[2:35:37] spookydh: @Alzarod Meeres is on an other lvl
[2:35:38] DejavuNeony: "i'm not toxic there is just too many kicks in m+" xdding
[2:35:39] Madgeneto: @dorki do lower keys xdding
[2:35:40] Redevoi: 6th man in keys when?!
[2:35:43] DatguyOrochi: @dorki so true these +10 keys are kicking my ass
[2:35:44] lucid_wow: @chompster2111 jmy is insane
[2:35:44] enigmasvea: just add a 6th member who shotcalls EZ
[2:35:46] Diazanite: @dorki baseg
[2:35:46] juno_sha: dorkiLook
[2:35:47] Mintyfreshhx: xdd
[2:35:49] erickalemaoo: @sinfusion he breathed helium gas
[2:35:49] noewon: NOTED M+ is too hard
[2:35:52] pixlbunz: so in this case they should have a 6th man
[2:35:52] litixio: Naowh is also insane at shotcalling
[2:35:53] Zoi888: and the aug is using 5% of brain capacity
[2:35:57] alexchopstix: 6th man shotcaller
[2:35:59] cliffster: Whats going on max? :)
[2:36:00] GabMoon__: @Redevoi Echo did that in MDI
[2:36:01] nerferals: if u play boomie like a 2-3% debuff only
[2:36:02] bebincalicious: I see why Dorki plays his boomkin these days. 1 min interrupt and just press starfall
[2:36:03] thenateo2: caster dps is best for sure
[2:36:04] Korupcija_: @0_____Kappa meeres was 6th man when fragnance was still playing lmao
[2:36:04] enigmasvea: m+ 6man inc Pog
[2:36:06] ciggyman: 6th man in keys
[2:36:07] miraagex: s3 is objectively more punishing for bad kicks/stops compared to s1/s2 and it's not even close
[2:36:11] luxationwow: do we not comment on how uneducated his argument is man, guys coming across even worse lol
[2:36:13] ohfoeshow: aug is literally made to be that guy
[2:36:13] Metaphix: so complex you need a commander like a battle lol
[2:36:16] ciggyman: new affix ,6th man
[2:36:16] sinfusion: @erickalemaoo struggling to take his man's seriously
[2:36:18] Ampped87: Aug shot caller?
[2:36:20] Ancine: but the tank is the one staring at the mobs more than their keybinds so they see whats happening
[2:36:21] enigmasvea: 6man keys GIGACHAD
[2:36:21] primatxy: tanking is easy
[2:36:22] chompster2111: @lucid_wow ofc but gingi is the first one that comes to mind when you think of multiclassing
[2:36:22] Denekyy: isnt tank the easiest role to play while shotcalling ?
[2:36:23] 0_____Kappa: @Korupcija_ Pog
[2:36:24] GabMoon__: tanking in raid its easier
[2:36:24] swisher_szn: its like the unspoken role of a tank i guess
[2:36:29] lockjaw570: tanks normally have easier rotations
[2:36:29] Nickystr1x: aug shot calling makes so much sense cause the rotation is piss and it doesn't matter what you do
[2:36:30] TooTubular: tanks are more naturally leaders in my mind
[2:36:30] taxiidk: thats exactly it
[2:36:30] eggs_boiled: is mythic raid tanking hard?
[2:36:34] cannibalcanyon: BM hunters are the best shotcallers, they got 3 buttons xdd
[2:36:34] neriumttv: ad
[2:36:35] Cakerinotv: tanks do it cuz they decide the pace, but i get that its too much of a coggy l
[2:36:36] Nekz3: because all tanks are GIGACHAD
[2:36:36] Lilurrn: Time to start the 6th man keys
[2:36:36] herptyderptyqwerty: people who tank are often leaders i guess
[2:36:36] Itankarenas: Adge
[2:36:38] TwicksTV: its hard for a 6th man to know when a vdh can silence things for a minute straight or they have to kite and cant do certain things etc
[2:36:38] Telonus: Adge
[2:36:39] Prime_Rage: Naowh once said he was too busy surviving there is no way for him to shot calling
[2:36:42] TroyStory__: ad
[2:36:42] combobulous: Its like any E sports, the team with a dedicated caller always had an advantage
[2:36:43] roguerhino: roguerhino subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:36:44] neriumttv: 1 min ad
[2:36:44] darthhelmett: adge
[2:36:45] fronkacean: twitch prime
[2:36:46] TroyStory__: Adge
[2:36:47] kallisz: i dont know about m+. I think tanks control everything and got a better feel for the oace of the key
[2:36:47] Reykosa: Tanks got a better perspective of actly pulls and kicks iguess
[2:36:49] dorki: Adge
[2:36:49] Cakerinotv: @TwicksTV true
[2:36:55] dorki: any gifters
[2:36:56] daiger5o: Didnt echo used meeres as 6th one time.? And forgot count in sanguine depths
[2:36:58] 0_____Kappa: dps players dont even understand the game so they cant shotcall dont @ me
[2:36:59] Aessari: @dorki how can an "infinite" scaling system be too hard? Is it not the whole design point to hit a hard wall to overcome at some point? Or is it a matter of how the scaling is not smooth?
[2:37:02] bertsquirts: the fuck is this 2:30 ad
[2:37:03] goombacci: @dorki o7
[2:37:05] Canwestop: @dorki Susge
[2:37:06] neriumttv: gift me
[2:37:07] bertsquirts: jesus christ
[2:37:07] fizzis_: having dps pop off ON pull and aggro gets fucked is rough
[2:37:07] royaloates: royaloates subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! my sub is almost too old to go nonverbal
[2:37:08] luxationwow: YOU ARE ALL SHIT, LET ME TELL YOU WHY I AM RIGHT. this is not quite the cold opening chat was looking forward to
[2:37:09] dorki: @dorki itd be too long to explain
[2:37:10] iisaacsr: @Maximum i think tank is the class that has to research everything on every dung/raid permanently so it feels like they have more knowledge on every dung than heals/dps
[2:37:16] Metaphix: wanna be a balla, shot calla
[2:37:17] lexxii44: @Maximum have you ever had an on stream drama before??
[2:37:18] Camelbak21: @cannibalcanyon They are not even being brought to the key 30+ key lvls n shit, so nah
[2:37:18] hashiramapdm: 2min gg
[2:37:20] alejandro7com: I ran a lot of keys with Hartlin in S1, he was so good at shotcalling and playing that it made me feel bad.
[2:37:22] dorki: tldr more tools = harder the game is
[2:37:23] Dille_gaming: Dilleeee subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:37:26] Zzekar: @maximum aug specc/players should have mic on by default and be forced to call out dbm/gw
[2:37:31] AbieCherry: andybrew shot calls and tanks wf keys like its actually insane he calls everything. His team also helps him a lot but he does most of it.
[2:37:33] kheim: kheim gifted a Tier 1 sub to dorki! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[2:37:37] Boreall: Wait, am I misreading this or is his mount keybind R?
[2:37:38] dorki: ty
[2:37:38] Hred5: bro can u increase the quality
[2:37:39] cannibalcanyon: i know, it was a joke. @Camelbak21
[2:37:43] Aessari: @dorki bing it up in some convo then please, I'd like to understand this perspective :)
[2:37:44] kheim: @dorki so cheap
[2:37:46] Metaphix: resto sham lol
[2:37:47] goombacci: hunters kek
[2:37:49] miraagex: @iisaacsr yes. tanks should know every spell of every mob in the dungeon (well, everyone must know that, but tanks specifically) + you need to track group cooldowns and pull accordingly
[2:37:50] Hred5: oh its me watching at 360p
[2:37:51] Hred5: ICANT
[2:37:52] eggs_boiled: @iisaacsr thats prob from tanks dictating the tempo of keys for a long time (my gues at least)
[2:37:52] enigmasvea: just 6man it EZ
[2:37:53] holtrop: agumentation should do it baseg
[2:37:56] lucid_wow: they would play aug
[2:37:56] kallisz: naowh and gingi had an interesting 2 min debate on how to call and use ccs. Gingis calls naowh said would kill him
[2:37:57] goombacci: yep two buttons
[2:37:58] hucking: bm hunter for sure ye
[2:37:59] lucid_wow: in a perfect world
[2:38:00] oneygaming: its a personality thing not a class thing
[2:38:01] ChopperYami: Fire mage
[2:38:03] Metapong: hear a lot of vdh groups say tell us when you're out of stops cause of how many stops vdh has now
[2:38:03] TooTubular: Elle put it well and succinctly imo. Its about the focus of the hardness on the high keys (e.g. 1 shot vs throughput)
[2:38:10] Zzekar: bm hunter + augs true
[2:38:12] pixlbunz: roger brown ftw
[2:38:14] llaundryy: bm boomy
[2:38:15] Nox1o: @dorki the numbers scale, not the amount of mechanics, the higher you go the more stuff needs to be handled or it will just oneshot you. And there is too much of that
[2:38:17] luxationwow: is it not more a mentality thing tho? like some people get less affected
[2:38:20] Hred5: BWYD Dadge
[2:38:21] herptyderptyqwerty: @AbieCherry hes kinda insane did you see him multi tasking in rwf with all the healing n shit was wild
[2:38:22] chompster2111: @Camelbak21 I would pay good money to watch you try and play bm in high keys @cannibalcanyon
[2:38:23] Brainshack: There was a time, probably long time ago where you would say that a playing raidleader should be a tank. What changed?
[2:38:26] Ok_Kingston: I raid lead mythic on havoc it stinks when i have to play mage or enhance
[2:38:29] enigmasvea: @Maximum 6man m+ will be the new meta for next expansion EZ
[2:38:31] dorki: @dorki ye that
[2:38:32] cajovysacok: i can close my eyes and play monk
[2:38:33] iisaacsr: @miraagex yeah, which leads to them having probably more knowledge than other players in their group, hence they feel the necessity to lead
[2:38:37] Metaphix: it takes mad muscle memory
[2:38:45] dorki: too many kicks, stops, defensives, weakauras etc
[2:38:47] cannibalcanyon: alright ill send you my paypal @chompster2111 ez money kid
[2:38:54] Korupcija_: because classes are too complex, bring back old survival
[2:39:10] goop: just play with an aug buddy
[2:39:13] dorki: HOLY thats u
[2:39:14] fizzis_: xdd
[2:39:14] Mousecat_: numbers scale = more frequent mechanics because shit dies slower
[2:39:15] joemammyyy: I'll gift the first two folks to @ me
[2:39:16] luxationwow: Is the issue not how he behaved? why is he talking about world of Warcraft?
[2:39:16] hivplus__: HOLY

[2:39:59] Spinerek: WA PROC
[2:39:59] Nox1o: the weakaura removes the thinking part of the shotcalling tbf, it would simplify it a lot

[2:40:18] Mactub: @Maximum just how you got AMZ nerfed. you caused the non verbal drama to start Pog
[2:40:20] yoonatuna24: Bro Nerf take some responsibility for being a toddler
[2:40:21] UsedRuggs: I need to learn how to make fire Weak Auras so I can get paid by guilds like Echo and Liquid to make them secret WAs every race

[2:40:35] noewon: BBoomer max is over 30
[2:40:36] cajovysacok: i want nonverbal sotify
[2:40:36] laetuss: no, twitch UI is dog

[2:40:38] goop: yo chat whats a peacock
[2:40:40] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: man this limit maximum guy
[2:40:41] DejavuNeony: xdding max has weak aura that helps him talk leass so its OK for me to mute myself when doing m+ with my own group OMEGALUL
[2:40:45] alexchopstix: honestly nerf just sounds cringe as fuck
[2:40:49] miraagex: @Boreall recent two takes were that their comp was weak, CCs shouldn't be shotcalled but rather automated
[2:40:49] swisher_szn: @VRVento guess i shouldve slapped a /s on there
[2:40:50] fitzasla: @Maximum you must feel like 30 something now
[2:40:50] Moodann36: lol my sub has "ended" but prime subs not avail yet
[2:40:52] Canwestop: YEP
[2:40:54] miraagex: @Boreall which one is bad?
[2:40:56] Koodiijr: @Maximum Imagine how I felt over the weekend I work for the damn company and had to go to calls for a week to get that working for people
[2:41:03] alejandro7com: Looks like the chat is discussing strategies for the game. Maybe I should suggest they try playing blindfolded for an extra challenge!
[2:41:04] Drenwow: same shirt pog
[2:41:06] chompster2111: @cannibalcanyon nah bcs i actually know how to live on a squishy class unlike 99% of ppl who play hunter

[2:41:30] Cvspartan: limit xdd
[2:41:31] Boreall: Saying you have the WA for you can go nonverbal is cringe, saying it's bad to have some kind of weak aura for stops is cringe, what is his goal in even saying that shit

[2:42:21] luxationwow: I mean him telling you what you wanted to do without asking you or having any info speaks to his character no?
[2:42:23] UsedRuggs: It just rotates the display of  AOE stops that everyone just tracks in MRT Any way
[2:42:28] thatsmybis: Susge
[2:42:30] cheados: i think his point is that shotcalling cog load sucks and nobody wants to do it
[2:42:36] hivplus__: CognitiveLoad
[2:42:38] eroth4290: where do I get this WA
[2:42:42] Pechorin333: @luxationwow armchair psychologist af
[2:42:42] Madgeneto: CognitiveLoad
[2:42:48] LifeofSlayer77: CognitiveLoad
[2:42:56] Thowarr: "reducing cognitive load"; he's spoken about this at length for almost a year now
[2:42:57] poroyou: This public?
[2:42:58] SeanyDLight: sensory overload
[2:42:59] yungbeex: can i have that
[2:43:01] maidenhaur: is that wa available somewhere?
[2:43:04] 0_____Kappa: YEP coggy load

[2:43:08] mason_90: can you share the wa? :)
[2:43:14] luxationwow: @pechorin333 yeah might’ve been a bit of a stretch ;)
[2:43:14] miraagex: firstGarf
[2:43:16] goombacci: it still reduces your cognitive load which is his whole point
[2:43:16] DejavuNeony: @Maximum where do we yoink that
[2:43:17] ohfoeshow: doesnt it highlight when its your stop next
[2:43:19] thatsmybis: firstGarf
[2:43:21] Metaphix: COGGERS load
[2:43:22] Madgeneto: @luxationwow not that deep
[2:43:23] Reykosa: is it on wagio?
[2:43:24] alejandro7com: @Miss_Anne_Throbby LULW true, some people just play by sound and instinct. Maybe they should turn on their brain too.
[2:43:25] Kaykonio: are you going to share the wa?
[2:43:26] Booorrito: Can we have so we can go nonverbal
[2:43:29] lucid_wow: coggy l
[2:43:40] Ionized4: wtb wa
[2:43:41] ullezanhimself: You spend 5 minutes explaining he was correct?
[2:43:42] marchippp: share the WA?
[2:43:44] alexchopstix: lol what
[2:43:45] Hred5: L take
[2:43:46] Cocotao: What is the WA ?
[2:43:47] Cervantas: "shot calling is hard so I can throw a baby fit"
[2:43:47] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: kapping
[2:43:49] luxationwow: kinda reductive argument
[2:43:49] DejavuNeony: this dude is so dishonest lol
[2:43:49] IKurrent: want to buy WA
[2:43:51] pseudo75: SNIFFA

[2:43:57] Boreall: Dude has a wild victim complex
[2:43:57] TheEmulatorKZ: the junkrat comparison is pretty bad ngl
[2:43:58] alexchopstix: This dude is such an idiot
[2:44:00] royaloates: comparing it to junkrat not talking was a terrible take haha
[2:44:00] Garzag_: xdd
[2:44:01] Hred5: holy L take
[2:44:02] LifeofSlayer77: KEKW
[2:44:03] voldeekay: JR hahaha "D
[2:44:07] Cervantas: there is no world where nerf isn' t in the wrong here
[2:44:07] Thowarr: DON'T BRING JR INTO THIS
[2:44:08] Denz_9: we live in a society truly
[2:44:08] Pechorin333: @Kaykonio search "aoe cc" on wago and there is one very similar thats public. works well
[2:44:11] UsedRuggs: JR being no Verbal is a feature not a bug though
[2:44:11] NDRandell: This is where he lost me
[2:44:14] bebincalicious: Non-Verbal Maximum xdd  󠀀
[2:44:14] alexchopstix: so fucking cringe
[2:44:15] BradySafety: JR GIGACHAD
[2:44:16] Garzag_: NonVerbal
[2:44:18] goombacci: the group has been together for a while, he is probably saying it is not crazy because he does it often
[2:44:21] aad33445: randomly brings up junkrat xdd
[2:44:23] Telonus: LetHimJoel
[2:44:25] butter51: wait what? he's saying that he went non verbal bc it's better and not because he's a child?
[2:44:25] thatsmybis: Well, it was in a 30 key soooo bit different
[2:44:26] butter51: lmfao
[2:44:26] baseboned: not the same buddy
[2:44:27] booznoon: he seems to have sidestepped around the point a bit
[2:44:27] Nox1o: dont think his point needs credibility, everyone knows shotcalling is incredibly hard
[2:44:28] eggs_boiled: guys dont be rude to nerf, its fine to disagree
[2:44:29] Slapsstick: then he uses JR to justify too, thats a rough hill to die on imo
[2:44:30] LifeofSlayer77: YEP
[2:44:30] nightbreeze93: ppl did go crazy tho
[2:44:31] Apeirophobic: @Cervantas he handled it wrong for sure but this is a dps take
[2:44:31] klondike_wow: jr being non verbal has been forever, my man wants a scapegiat
[2:44:32] Cervantas: they still timed the key
[2:44:32] Nickystr1x: coming for JR is not the road i would traverse when trying to paint myself in a better light
[2:44:36] cucumbertoessniffa: he clearly came back on stream on the offensive
[2:44:36] ciggyman: muted in the ugliest way possible
[2:44:37] vallinae: he shit talked ellesmere then muted
[2:44:40] Camelbak21: called ppl out then muted
[2:44:44] moo_28: he even dissed them and said i hate doing keys with this grp
[2:44:44] luxationwow: he said i hate playing with this heater just before muting…
[2:44:48] luxationwow: healer*
[2:44:51] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: he was just a bitch and cant admit it
[2:44:54] voldeekay: he spoke bad about ellesmere then he muted
[2:44:54] 7negative: You muted and were mean to your healer and you're a child
[2:44:59] alexchopstix: lol trying to pass him not talking as him playing non verbally is hilarious
[2:45:03] yoonatuna24: nerf is an ass what else is new
[2:45:04] Lilurrn: he threatened to mute and then proceeded to mute
[2:45:07] sUb2_w9nDeR: @alejandro7com truth be told, im only doing 21's however i know i should be in the 16s bracket. but i guess i had hoped people in 20s would enjoy throwing out a kick on important targets. i just assume they join a key and turn off nameplates because they get in the way KEKW
[2:45:09] Cervantas: @apeirophobic  wtf does that even mean? The guy is wrong. he handled it wrong in every aspect thats facts
[2:45:10] BrownSugarIsBae: 30 something years old acting like a toddler
[2:45:14] ciggyman: but thats junkrat
[2:45:14] xhriiis: calling junkrat out was super unnecessary
[2:45:15] amperegames: he also decided to have a nasty parting shot before muting
[2:45:16] jerkmcgee: maybe lets skip the namecalling in chat boys
[2:45:16] hivplus__: Junkrat is not muted he has just been mewing since 2015
[2:45:18] sockenpeter: Junkrat non verbal
[2:45:20] ciggyman: you know that going into it
[2:45:20] Telonus: We're stuck in a loop
[2:45:25] ZACKandATTACK: He could've expressed his frustration better. The way he did it was really childish and rude to everyone else
[2:45:26] zarrzxtv: but junkrat just never talks
[2:45:27] 0wn3y: @hivplus_ ahaahah :D
[2:45:28] MilaPriest: what is going on here :D what is Max after now and hey everyone :)
[2:45:29] Boreall: Everybody is "going crazy" cause he's acting like a petulant child
[2:45:29] klondike_wow: yeah but the people he's mentioning are known to be always non verbal KEKW
[2:45:32] mkam225: it's just childish, and not admitting that is even more childish
[2:45:32] Thor_R: hey leave JR out of this
[2:45:32] litixio: @Telonus fr
[2:45:33] tehKrazeee: This is a common defense mechanism. He's justifying his action by using an unrelated example after the fact
[2:45:37] Garzag_: junkrat the OG nonverbal BASED
[2:45:38] Tyraze: KEKW
[2:45:39] miraagex: @Maximum thier +30WM is like your heroic splits
[2:45:39] mozerra: I feel that toxicity
[2:45:40] ahri_feet_connoisseur: what is this drama?
[2:45:41] alejandro7com: Looks like the chat is on fire today! So many interesting conversations going on. I'm just here for the popcorn 🍿
[2:45:42] miraagex: Cant compare to RWF
[2:45:42] bhanter: hivplus_ GIGACHAD
[2:45:43] Madgeneto: KEKW BASED
[2:45:44] ahri_feet_connoisseur: can someone fill me in?
[2:45:44] beedcreeps: JR "what he say fuck me for"
[2:45:45] stiles_xd: ye surely all of twitch chat knows social interactions and would never behave this way at all
[2:45:48] Nickystr1x: JR not non-verbal we just can't hear the register his species communicates at
[2:45:49] chompster2111: @Miss_Anne_Throbby nah dont let anyone chat shit to you mate, if ur in 21's you deserve to be in 21's
[2:45:57] japo131313: This is biggest punk move to bring Junkrat into this, zero respect left for this baby who cant take any responsibility
[2:45:59] LifeofSlayer77: KEKW
[2:46:02] glitsmonk: ive had raid leaders do that, get mad over something and then just stop calling stuff for like and hour
[2:46:03] iAruban: whos junkrat
[2:46:03] nanerpus_: IT IS WHAT IT IS BOYS
[2:46:04] tobivel: You cant compare those 2 , sry
[2:46:13] Madgeneto: "just look at the timers" KEKW
[2:46:14] miraagex: They have not been doing hard content during drama though
[2:46:14] ahri_feet_connoisseur: what even is the context
[2:46:15] Apeirophobic: @Cervantas it means i bet youve never done shot calling in high keys and understand the coggy L it takes and how thankless it often is as you sit there just pressing your dps buttons lol. He did however handle it in a very toxic manner, not debating that.
[2:46:19] beedcreeps: max called nerf a bitch
[2:46:21] bebincalicious: Jeathe FeelsBadMan
[2:46:24] Slapsstick: @iAruban dps that plays with growl and dorki. No mic and non verbal
[2:46:24] nightbreeze93: but we're not in his key XD what
[2:46:28] xSHOTE: wow community its just MEGA TOXIC, thats all. Fuck the drama man
[2:46:29] Hred5: HOLY L take
[2:46:29] sUb2_w9nDeR: @Miss_Anne_Throbby <3
[2:46:34] ThisIzD: calling someone a bitch in the hood will get you shot bruh
[2:46:34] spivet: Kappa yeah maybe he gets into it in a minute
[2:46:35] alexchopstix: Dude cannot admit he's in the wrong
[2:46:37] Nickystr1x: @Maximum imagine you trying to go non-verbal with the people in your raid group. the flame would be epic
[2:46:39] fronkacean: but thats expectation based... they start muted...
[2:46:43] reszyy_: growl defended this guy btw
[2:46:43] smothgeko: society
[2:46:44] eyxx: hasn't taken a single ounce of accountability yet
[2:46:44] poroyou: Can we have the WA dad?
[2:46:45] aryonring: !wa
[2:46:46] DejavuNeony: does he not understand that the issue is why he muted and how lol
[2:46:48] flahhoz: Nerf is HARD COPING
[2:46:48] Cervantas: @apeirophobic  bro I bet you litearlly haven't logged in since legon, stop the dick riding and grow up man. He handled it bad period
[2:46:49] thatsmybis: we aint pushing 32s LUL
[2:46:49] kallisz: jr listens though
[2:46:49] zashar_: jesus Nerf is such a bitch! he is unable to take responsability for his actions at all. Jesus cringe christ
[2:46:49] baseboned: weak
[2:46:51] Zzekar: smartest move is to watch this on x1.25 speed
[2:46:51] Faraday5001: VeryPog
[2:46:52] pseudo75: Kappa ok dude
[2:46:52] Canwestop: i'm a BM hunter I don't say shit I just beastcleave
[2:46:52] MajorBenny: Tanks just get shit on in general and if they act out people just complain more
[2:46:54] cucumbertoessniffa: the pitch of his voice is very telling
[2:46:59] bjarkanthepoet: saying nothing in a 20 key vs a 30 LUL
[2:47:01] Jimmo24: he's expressing frustration about the double standard
[2:47:03] alexchopstix: He 100% knows hes in the wrong too lol
[2:47:03] TheEmulatorKZ: rage muting vs someone who is non-verbal for personal reasons...
[2:47:04] gretriku: we also arent doing world first keys
[2:47:06] Telonus: MAN STUFF
[2:47:07] Denz_9: normie
[2:47:07] klemo__: not saying and muting is not the same tho
[2:47:08] glitsmonk: chat who is sweetheart?
[2:47:09] vallinae: so growl was wrong is what ur saying
[2:47:14] moo_28: i rewatched them vid just now and it wasnt that rly bad for him to mute
[2:47:17] Canwestop: @Glitoxic it's me :)
[2:47:19] Madgeneto: @Glitoxic you are <3
[2:47:23] Delias__: He prob don't undrestand chat in general is mad at him when only his team have the right to be
[2:47:24] alexchopstix: we don't have to be doing top keys to understand this guy is being a douche
[2:47:24] glitsmonk: :)
[2:47:25] pseudorand_: yeah and now it sounds bad too.
[2:47:25] goombacci: calling for 20 people on new content is different than calling for 5 people on content they have done over and over
[2:47:26] Lilurrn: I mean if you calling out the entire time and then just suddenly stop then he is def in the wrong
[2:47:27] japo131313: @TheEmulatorKZ yup... this punk worth no respect sayin shit like this :S
[2:47:28] chompster2111: @Canwestop youre underthinking it alot then ngl
[2:47:30] pseudorand_: from his own mouth
[2:47:32] xSHOTE: nerf its just an addicted toxic, thats all
[2:47:37] catechism__: I just can't get over him being openly cruel to Elle like.. every dungeon
[2:47:43] burne114: his chat was pretty gross immediately afterwards, like personally toxic
[2:47:43] kallisz: im a boss at my job, if i suddenly didnt take responsibility over the schedule and calling out my coworkers for not just doing it. it just not his role
[2:47:44] StarShopping95: StarShopping95 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 36 month streak! Chatting nymnCorn
[2:47:44] Apeirophobic: @Cervantas liamkPal
[2:47:44] reymargera: Chatting redditors
[2:47:45] llaundryy: what a soy
[2:47:45] AbieCherry: people were insanely toxic in his chat it was really bad. Its not reddit. People started brigading his chat real hard when you guys started to discuss this
[2:47:48] klondike_wow: nerf has always been bitchy
[2:47:53] Madgeneto: BASED
[2:47:55] Nox1o: i kinda get his side because he literally does not want to shotcall and still does it. Getting tilted can happen but I feel like this just got blown out of proportions by jpc at the end, they should have chilled 30min and then talk about it
[2:47:55] beedcreeps: reddit and especially twitch chat
[2:47:58] herptyderptyqwerty: thats it
[2:47:58] alejandro7com: Possible comment to make:
[2:48:04] jschultz214: that’s the worse take ever we don’t talk because they are lower pug keys they are a team and should be talking to each other
[2:48:05] miraagex: @beedcreeps reddit is billions times worse
[2:48:06] kheim: is the AOE stop WA public? and why isnt it @Maximum
[2:48:06] bayazijr: He's not wrong that people HARDCORE overreacted and still are lol
[2:48:08] DannyBoii614: where can i read about the drama?
[2:48:11] DannyBoii614: i missed some of it
[2:48:11] japo131313: Actually Nerf being muted is not bad for the ears... see? its not hard to be toxic...
[2:48:14] beedcreeps: @miraagex sure sure
[2:48:14] suparferret: in a bit he talks about chat not having accountability all the while he's not taking any accountability for his actions still NotLikeThis
[2:48:21] Entelligenz: people on the internet get up into his business like he did something to them
[2:48:22] luxationwow: comparing himself to junk rat was a bit…yikes
[2:48:23] kallisz: its his role, dont bitch about it. just do it
[2:48:23] beast2: true
[2:48:25] eyxx: does he not see the difference OMEGALUL
[2:48:26] Dzor12: Omg I thought Max was in a call with Nerf and I freaked out a bit
[2:48:27] dorki: true yumy said this too
[2:48:28] Telonus: It'
[2:48:30] 7negative: Max's face says it all, guy talking himself in circles
[2:48:31] miraagex: @beedcreeps people on reddit think that +11 is a hard key LMAO
[2:48:31] tobivel: What i said, elle does it a lot
[2:48:32] Entelligenz: its so cringe that everyone is judging him
[2:48:33] zashar_: yeah buttt stop talking is not "IM GOING TO MUTE"
[2:48:35] Pyrrha_GG: nerf in the wrong here I think, but people are definitely being unreasonable, personally attacking him, it’s pretty ridiculous chatters need to get a grip for sure.
[2:48:36] holtrop: billy and elle dont go completely nonverbal tho
[2:48:40] kallisz: not a role as in tank, just his role in the social group
[2:48:40] yoonatuna24: but they didnt threaten to mute lmao
[2:48:40] Lilurrn: but he explicitly did it so thats the problem
[2:48:41] Entelligenz: let him sort it out with his mates
[2:48:45] zack68: KEKW
[2:48:55] MajorBenny: Tanks do get singled out a lot
[2:48:55] vallinae: they do it because nerf slings shit at them all the fucking time
[2:48:55] ysilentswordy: the act of actually muting has meaning in itself though
[2:48:55] UsedRuggs: I dont know how that team is still together, they get toxic af to each other
[2:48:57] mkam225: feels like cope for not working on a better mental game
[2:48:58] imjebb: growl aint mdi anymore thats the diff
[2:49:00] Zzekar: not talking for 3 years is something while actively calling stuff going MUTE is totally diff ...
[2:49:00] R1ZZ023: what is happening
[2:49:00] Telonus: It depends, sometimes it's better to not say anything because you know what will come out will be toxic garbage
[2:49:02] Pechorin333: he is being singled out
[2:49:02] alexchopstix: he could just act like an adult
[2:49:02] bebincalicious: You ignore Driney too, bad team dynamic?
[2:49:02] hdott52: specially in a hw key
[2:49:03] Canwestop: least tilted DH player though frfr
[2:49:03] theweirdsquiggly: going silent != muting imo
[2:49:06] alexchopstix: instead of being a lil bitch
[2:49:07] dorki: it's just overreacted from them
[2:49:07] cataphract1014: shows like a bunch of dudes that dont really like each other playing because they are all good
[2:49:08] JPociot: JPociot subscribed with Prime. 
[2:49:12] goombacci: @UsedRuggs as of 3 days ago it isnt
[2:49:12] Nox1o: always has been
[2:49:12] Avarizz: that is a cool ass mount
[2:49:13] ddepan: yeah i was gonna say
[2:49:13] Newlander: He didn't just mute the dungeon though. He then just up and left and went afk
[2:49:13] herptyderptyqwerty: it is KEKW
[2:49:13] sorliee: always has been KEKW
[2:49:15] ahri_feet_connoisseur: what team?
[2:49:16] Italicuss: why is this like huge drama seems like a very private matter
[2:49:16] vallinae: nerf is just used to being the bully and getting away with it, and now he is being called out
[2:49:17] goop: always has been
[2:49:19] luxationwow: we got the example where ellesmere said I hate this tank before muting? oops doesn’t exist
[2:49:20] beedcreeps: @miraagex whats your point?
[2:49:21] herptyderptyqwerty: thats their secret always has been
[2:49:22] Madgeneto: chatters taking sides are the most cringe thing ever
[2:49:26] cajovysacok: they need maxx teambuilding camp
[2:49:30] Raggu2: Surely we have all been in a situation where we KNEW if we spoke it would greatly offend who we were with. Everyone has done it.
[2:49:35] epilepticunicorn_: @Maximum idk you ignore driney.
[2:49:35] SachroTV: get a 6th gamer
[2:49:35] fronkacean: DEFLECTING BLAME Pog
[2:49:36] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: thats actually true
[2:49:36] Emm_Zee: Greg? GIGACHAD
[2:49:38] itsthelichqueen: Ayyy! spaced46Wigglynoodle
[2:49:39] bebincalicious: Gingi GIGACHAD
[2:49:39] Qubuuuu: BASED
[2:49:43] holtrop: I think nerf just needs a lil break from shotcalling at least. Seems like its sucking the fun out of the game for him.
[2:49:45] don3dward: sometimes it's better to shutup (mute) them keep talking and tilt more
[2:49:46] mfalc: than dont do MDI
[2:49:47] ddepan: not aware of the drama but their vibes are way off as a team and makes it hard to watch them
[2:49:49] ubba90: jpc uise to do it
[2:49:51] Varae__: What does that have to do with flaming Elle
[2:49:52] Lilurrn: He is def coping
[2:49:53] Pechorin333: exactly what growl said
[2:49:54] MajorBenny: Dude, tanking is literally seeing everything and calling out mistakes. Just imagine the Tank finally does something controversial... This is gonna happen
[2:49:54] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: nerf is still a bitch
[2:49:55] GoAskAliceVAL: i wouldnt shot call if my globals were mbeing asked for ahahha
[2:49:57] caseypastella: who else does it then?
[2:49:58] miraagex: @beedcreeps twitch is not as bad and horrible as reddit
[2:49:58] booznoon: its not the fact that he muted its that he did it in a bad way and didn't apologize or anything supposedly
[2:49:59] holyaxx: from a viewer perspective nerf can be toxic  and never feels he is wrong, but when you are one of the best m+ tanks you get away with things
[2:50:02] UsedRuggs: they all bicker, including JPC
[2:50:05] Pechorin333: @mfalc they dont do mdi
[2:50:10] holoylan: Echo has 3 shotcallers, built diffy
[2:50:15] Celestial990: @holtrop thats part of his point. he literally cant take a break from shotcalling cuz then hed have to take a break from playing completely cuz everyone expects the tank to call
[2:50:22] yoonatuna24: JPC does it but then Nerf have this fucking control freak going on and shot calls anyways
[2:50:23] eggs_boiled: this is just built up frustration getting aired all at once
[2:50:24] nightbreeze93: why should he explain himself to drama sniffers KEKW
[2:50:24] Lilurrn: deflecting and irresponsible
[2:50:25] Mfkr90: whats the TLDR of this
[2:50:25] flahhoz: why is it stupid, tanks are in the forefront of the group formation. and atleast in this season they are in charge of the cc cus they have all the cc @Maximum
[2:50:28] timmayb166: he excuses himself the entire time
[2:50:29] tobivel: @maximum why dont you have liquid m+ team like echo?
[2:50:32] grimmakyr: Thats becuase your being a man about it, nerf isnt lol
[2:50:38] luxationwow: he lead with calling chat passenger princesses
[2:50:38] baseboned: unlucky
[2:50:40] booznoon: bit childish
[2:50:42] Lilurrn: no accountability for sure
[2:50:43] cucumbertoessniffa: its not the first meltdown ive seen from nerf though.
[2:50:43] calming_insanity: sounds like a bunch of excuses to try to save face
[2:50:44] vallinae: nerf just feels what the rest of his team feels now
[2:50:45] hucking: idk how often he does it but i noticed naowh was doing shotcalling for the 31 AD they have a vod for
[2:50:46] Abma13: nerf also is a dealing w/ the stress of having an newish baby
[2:50:47] alejandro7com: Looks like we're witnessing a meltdown from Nerf, but hey, at least it's not his first one!
[2:50:49] kheim: He takes are good, but taking zero accountability is just depleting all good takes
[2:50:50] BrownSugarIsBae: its zero accountability so far
[2:50:52] baseboned: so play with an aug
[2:50:55] goop: @alejandro7com LMAO
[2:50:55] sw0ngs: tbh, if he didnt mute and just went silent, then it woulda been fine. The fact he went out of the way to mute was like a statement... fuck you guys kinda moment
[2:50:56] Slapsstick: @luxationwow I mean we are
[2:50:57] Kaykonio: his ego doesnt allow him to be accountable
[2:50:58] eyxx: alejandro BASED
[2:50:58] Cakerinotv: dont disagree with nerf, but i at least feel like he could just finish the key and take a break
[2:50:58] stabjo0: Is the WA max made public?
[2:50:59] Zzekar: how can u skip back :D
[2:51:00] japo131313: @Abma13 himself
[2:51:00] baseboned: that's YOUR Choice to not use aug!
[2:51:01] miraagex: @Mfkr90 there is nothing. people love "bread and circuses"
[2:51:03] Delias__: I mean don't need to say sorry to chat or it's his fault, only to his team
[2:51:06] SCMSV: how long has max been reacting to this chat
[2:51:06] holtrop: yeah no aug in the group you really gotta focus as tank
[2:51:07] klondike_wow: alejandro spitting BASED
[2:51:08] Abma13: not to absolve him
[2:51:09] ninemoreminutes: alejandro so based
[2:51:10] UsedRuggs: @hucking Naowh is built diff though, dude is just always a vibe
[2:51:10] sorliee: hmm
[2:51:10] Canwestop: @alejandro7com HOLY
[2:51:18] Rottee: whats an aug have to do with someone missing a kick
[2:51:19] Abma13: #dadthings
[2:51:24] splootzi: hes too far up his own ass to realize why its was cringe. Saying they have too, and they using that as an excuse to not take accountability for having a bad moment is the cringe part.
[2:51:25] mycho_: @alejandro7com baseg
[2:51:29] MajorBenny: I really dont think this is anythign different from a dps or healer bricking a key. Tanks are allowed to blow up every now and then
[2:51:31] VSpeed: ppl actually read wow reddit?
[2:51:35] citystalk: citystalk subscribed with Prime. 
[2:51:37] hucking: @UsedRuggs i dont dispute that
[2:51:39] seamuscg: @VSpeed YEP
[2:51:41] reymargera: Chatting redditors
[2:51:45] beedcreeps: @miraagex it definitely is. in different aspects, maybe not thinking 11s are hard. But look at all the people here acting like armchair psychologists thinking they have the best mental
[2:51:45] alexchopstix: i just don't understand why people act this way when you're supposed to be having fun playing this game lol
[2:51:45] booznoon: facts
[2:51:45] subwaybaron: @UsedRuggs Not recently LUL
[2:51:50] wogcog: @VSpeed WoW reddit btw
[2:51:50] Sweetest89: He was responding to his twitch chat
[2:51:52] AbieCherry: @Maximum he's responding to people in his chat
[2:51:53] imanyone: @VSpeed demon time for you huh
[2:51:56] forgotwhyimhere: @Rottee aug makes tanks immortal. with an aug he can focus less on his surv and its easier to shot call. without an aug he has to focus on surv.
[2:51:57] Zzekar: @Rottee he said its all built up ..... u cant get it ?
[2:51:57] Cervantas: he has no team to message
[2:52:00] smolderdaddyuwu: @Maximum when nerf said he didn't have his headphones on, I feel like that is a huge fucking cop out. like you said, own up to it.
[2:52:05] jschultz214: it’s just a poor me and excuses of why what happened happened like fuck just take some accountability
[2:52:07] Sweetest89: He also said that if Eli was on, he'd be playing with him
[2:52:08] 7negative: he didn't even have a bad dungeon, -- They timed the key
[2:52:18] UsedRuggs: @subwaybaron ye? I havn't stayed up to speed. But everytime I see Naowh in any content he's just in a good mood and usually leading the way like he designed the mechanics
[2:52:18] miraagex: @beedcreeps i think all people think that when they're in a calm state. it's really hard to fabricate actual anger emotion to change own perspective
[2:52:20] Madgeneto: nerf might be a bitch, but he'll never be a redditor size bitch
[2:52:25] baseboned: I highly doubt it, since his stance seems to be "i did nothing wrong"
[2:52:25] Cervantas: if he takes accountability people can't really attack him
[2:52:26] combobulous: The worst thing is this man is vocalizing this to 100s of viewers, with no accountability in mind because he has a platform to defend himself
[2:52:29] bigpharma___: im so mad about this
[2:52:30] kallisz: he did though
[2:52:30] vallinae: because he does always flame ellesmere
[2:52:30] Varae__: He did both lol
[2:52:31] bigpharma___: im fucking irate
[2:52:32] goop: he did call out ellesmere? wut
[2:52:33] Entelligenz: imagine going onto reddit and taking the time to type some shit about a guy that did something to his teammates on his stream which could be easily handled internally
[2:52:34] sinfusion: He has to be using a voice changer right??
[2:52:36] alexchopstix: lolllllll
[2:52:36] baseboned: wut
[2:52:40] alejandro7com: Looks like the chat is lively today! I guess we're all here for the 'bread and circuses'!
[2:52:41] luxationwow: @beedcreeps I think the point people are making is that we might play shit etc due to our bad mental, that’s different to telling someone you hate playing with them then muting lol
[2:52:47] 1_7_4: just dont be a dick?
[2:52:48] voldeekay: he did both lmao :D
[2:52:51] vallinae: @Entelligenz imagine writing an essay in twitch chat
[2:52:51] caseypastella: #based
[2:52:51] moo_28: it wasnt even about callin things he pulled a bit bigger pull than usual and they started making jokes about it
[2:52:52] subwaybaron: @UsedRuggs Yea, think its just been the last few days tbf, seems to be the case with like every team atm though LUL
[2:52:52] Slapsstick: headphones out was fake? MONKA
[2:52:56] UsedRuggs: @sinfusion no, he just sounds perpetually 12
[2:52:56] timmayb166: he’s talking to his twitch chat
[2:52:59] 0_____Kappa: its impossible for him to apologize because he is never wrong YEP
[2:53:00] Lawso42: or just don't be an angry little chicken mcnugget
[2:53:00] Entelligenz: @Entelligenz yea true
[2:53:00] mfalc: but you did call him out
[2:53:01] gretriku: he literally did shit on ellesmere before he muted wtf lol
[2:53:06] ZACKandATTACK: He called him out, they clapped back, then he muted
[2:53:06] amperegames: he flamed him and muted?>?????
[2:53:07] sUb2_w9nDeR: so if youre response is always the same, maybe change your approach so people dont think youre a dick? pretty easy fix
[2:53:08] Canwestop: lmao
[2:53:11] antisprime: HUH
[2:53:12] LifeofSlayer77: KEKW 󠀀

[2:53:14] vallinae: nerf cant see that he is a bully
[2:53:14] pseudo75: COPIUM
[2:53:16] goop: he literally said "i hate playing with this healer and by this healer i mean you" LMFAO
[2:53:19] Marpell: is it even English?
[2:53:20] iAruban: he called him out before muting lol
[2:53:20] Lilurrn: nerf seems dilusional
[2:53:21] Shalodar: And he might have done just both... LUL
[2:53:22] mkam225: flaming and then muting is very different lol
[2:53:22] beedcreeps: its 100% correct that chat would act up tho
[2:53:25] Sorin__: he was shitting on ellesmere even before that pack
[2:53:30] zashar_: @Miss_Anne_Throbby <3
[2:53:30] goombacci: nerf should have just said "from now on I have first stun there" and thats that
[2:53:31] moo_28: @gretriku he even toold  him if used a cd i will leave grp
[2:53:32] Canwestop: what maining a DH tank does to a mf smh
[2:53:32] vallinae: and he deserves it because he is a bully
[2:53:33] pseudorand_: he shits on elle for no reason at all
[2:53:34] xSHOTE: bro the drama its just bulshit dude. Whats the point
[2:53:35] LuckeyAtel: You don't mute mid-key. Like come on.
[2:53:37] beedcreeps: cause theyd all say exactly what he said
[2:53:38] Aylena_Evouline: not talking and not answering when people talk to you is different though
[2:53:42] Marpell: cuz he shits Elle constantly
[2:53:42] kallisz: elle does barely talk back
[2:53:43] tobivel: So it is the same
[2:53:43] iden_26: that shows that the game is not easy.. imagine for the civils we need WA and all these things going on  and we have 30 bottons and macro
[2:53:46] dorki: healer fans are 100% freaks
[2:53:49] catechism__: Elle basically never snipes back
[2:53:55] Delias__: Yeah his chat is always bad when he call someone out
[2:53:55] Pyrrha_GG: people are doing it in this chat right now
[2:53:56] Blackeye1992: @dorki true
[2:53:57] catechism__: I resemble that remark

[2:53:59] mkam225: thats a reflexive defense
[2:53:59] ciggyman: dorki vs. growl
[2:54:00] Warptime: @goop we have to ignore that statement so it doesnt look like he's 100% in the wrong... bro fucked up
[2:54:01] Pyrrha_GG: regardless
[2:54:02] oneygaming: elle has a bigger stream coz he is nice
[2:54:04] DatguyOrochi: @dorki guilty as charged

[2:54:08] Canwestop: @dorki healer/aug pov ResidentSleeper
[2:54:09] MajorBenny: I'm honestly like this when I tank too much in a day. You see everyones mistakes so much easier as a tank and if you make one the group is gonna want to call it out too.
[2:54:10] darkwingduckkk: @dorki same with guardian druid lovers.
[2:54:10] vallinae: bully gets called out
