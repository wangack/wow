[2:58:59] JacquelingTV: So uh... What about mage nowadays? Fire used to be good, is it just trash now? Also what about Classic mage? I don't wanna play Frost cuz it's boring, Fire is my fav spec. Arcane is fine but I would like Fire more nuke-y, or at least it used to be.
[2:58:59] The_Cocodrilo: yeah 100% - 5man skirmishes in the open world is the best part of classic PVP
[2:59:02] thisisbrettt: you could have 5 man groups that are with each other too
[2:59:05] xobritnee: I can never stay on the same layer as my group
[2:59:08] masonpaws: what is the raid debuff??
[2:59:08] Argartv: They should allow 10 man raids at weekends
[2:59:08] thisisbrettt: that just agree not to fight each other

[2:59:23] ferknasty: whiny huntard
[2:59:23] Maiqthehighking: it was always all hunter loot
[2:59:25] yakattack1738: melee hunter hits so hard

[2:59:51] Maiqthehighking: melle hunter doing so much more dps than warrior is crazy
[2:59:52] The_Cocodrilo: howd u make ur gold brotherman?
[2:59:52] Duhski: reckon theyll nerf melee hunt and spriest? they seem kinda out of control lol
[2:59:58] jajj3: how do you get Sod atlasloot ?
[3:00:00] lilyoungskrr: hunters can have all loot now, just gotta realise at 60 everything is warrior prio

[3:00:15] BullzeyeWoW: Im a melee hunter and passed the epic g omer gun to range bunter
[3:00:16] H0tslice: i wish i could understand this game better i wanna do pvp but never even leveled a character
[3:00:18] asloff: as a hunter i usually need on cloth gear for "experimental" builds xarKappa
[3:00:30] fallen1881: think they are getting us ready for arena? with stv pvp
[3:00:49] krienth: gachiBASS
[3:00:54] BootsTheAlpaca: YOU'RE WHAT NOW?

[3:01:02] ThrokkTheWarrior: mages are so OP
[3:01:06] Zerkon24: @lilyoungskrr are you saying that warriors will get their strong at lvl 60?

[3:01:34] ironl0l: ironl0l subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:01:38] asloff: might've been a bit too deep
[3:01:38] dumpdeer: they need an arathi highlands event for rep

[3:01:53] demloroth: saw the shaman casting and boom
[3:01:57] Kylemist: INDEED
[3:01:58] lambda__function: @HoppsAlot correct
[3:01:58] Nooshbag98: arathi has been a lot of fun
[3:01:59] fernandorbretas: I feel like they will put Arena in SoD, but only after the late game content updates.
[3:01:59] Zonex2004: This doesn't make for good viewing content imo. Much more fun as the player. Opposite of hc
[3:02:01] ironl0l: sod is really one of the best things that happened
[3:02:01] pho_rilla: Yep
[3:02:04] demloroth: @HoppsAlot no

[3:02:08] miciahclay: @dumpdeer They are working on fixing it, this event is supposed to have an AB rep option
[3:02:12] Titus20J: Xar hates arenas confirmed
[3:02:21] al_capow: what if they had like, open world BFD-style gauntlet arenas where you could spectate by standing there in the world?
[3:02:28] Anderzonx: thats real hydra

[3:07:04] Nefenn: @nikolaievitch1 you get bloods (next to minimap) and turn them in at an altar, this gives you currency which you buy it with
[3:07:07] gorthymog: Sham > Pally in pvp??

[3:07:51] Nefenn: @Zonex2004 pretty much yea, every 3 hours
[3:07:58] Zonex2004: Got it
[3:08:01] Titus20J: They should make it only usable sub 35%, and i play an S Priest
[3:08:07] zen0vae: if you arent getting 1 shot every fight are you even playing sod
[3:08:14] Ramsaybolton92: mage can one shot its ok but spriest no ?
[3:08:16] ama__deus: @Titus20J that'd fuck SP really hard in PVE

[3:09:38] Duhski: spriest is more op than boomy, but no-one gave it any attention
[3:09:39] Thetacoeater007: theres more tokens to be earned near the big boss
[3:09:39] mavrayeth: def not a 1 shot
[3:09:39] oprawindfurytv: i got 1k coins with Trill on my team
[3:09:42] SmashTheDude: fighting around boss gives you a lot of coins @Xaryu
[3:09:47] doublemeatpalace: What should I level next, mage hunter pal or priest?
[3:09:49] leonwaltt: could you hypothetically remove someone from your group near the end and get their points
[3:09:51] Duhski: i said it soon as p2 runes came out and i got downvoted to fuck on reddit lmao
[3:09:52] Titus20J: @ama__deus True

[3:59:51] Xiunitv: WHY
[3:59:52] Saiauriel: oh its with Xaryu viewers? so its like hard mode
[3:59:52] Xiunitv: fire is bis

[4:00:13] slapshotsd: @booker105 makes sense
[4:00:14] shalomski: I think your shadowpriest pvp spec
[4:00:14] facenam3: On which server you playing?
[4:00:17] isleswitch: its is cause FFB can proc ignite huge ignites from hsttaer

[4:00:19] KhanoTV: I havent thought about it
[4:00:19] ctrlbeesy: xarIQ

[4:00:21] SurrealAndre: frostfire competes but fireball still wins
[4:00:21] ShikseWTF: Sims say bad
[4:00:22] dreamwalk9r: its not its trash
[4:00:26] isleswitch: shatter
[4:00:31] HawaiianSpaceLasers: it's good on mana but doesnt do as much damage as fire
[4:00:37] booker105: @slapshotsd he could potentially be testing spell damage on these mobs though, they have a shit ton of armor for a melee pet
[4:00:37] ctrlbeesy: do u even parse bro
[4:00:39] FinkleTheMage: It's bad my man, FFB doesn't hit for anything
[4:00:39] Jubilation12: @Knaxxis i got some 90+ parses in here :D
[4:00:43] Slydawgy1: dual spec when
[4:00:45] ninetysix: what if u stayed as a turret spamming firebolt, will it still be bad?
[4:00:48] KhanoTV: Try it
[4:00:51] grubols: pve boring cuz of sims lol
[4:00:54] Knaxxis: @jubilation12 I already beat sod took 4 days
[4:00:54] CIamzy: Try it
[4:00:55] KhanoTV: would be fun to watch you try
[4:01:04] FelipeLLs: sims say its bad = not playing so cool to think like this
[4:01:05] slapshotsd: @booker105 yeah resistances were really wonky phase 1, could be testing
[4:01:07] Knaxxis: @jubilation12 look up lilborey
[4:01:08] HawaiianSpaceLasers: I've tried it, it has tons of synergy but just ends up doing less damage idk
[4:01:08] shalomski: Change loot threshold,  saves faffing on greens
[4:01:11] Reaperz_kinetic: @grubols GIGACHAD s dont use em
[4:01:15] Jubilation12: @Knaxxis ya same shits ez
[4:01:21] naturalduck: Arcane blast seems way better if you want a mana efficient damage build w/ the new missile barrage
[4:01:22] cphil3: why did you bring 80 bolts of silk to raid?
[4:01:31] HawaiianSpaceLasers: casting 3 second frostfire bolts kinda rough too lol
[4:01:31] NawtyTyme: u can delete ur ashenvale cat
[4:01:33] parkrangerpeter: @Xaryu you dont need ashenvale mount
[4:01:34] Jubilation12: @Knaxxis didnt kill last boss?

[4:01:47] Rpkosh123: put everything into bank with summon on you
[4:02:00] Knaxxis: @jubilation12 ppl left on last boss :(
[4:02:06] slapshotsd: @FelipeLLs honestly some real thematic throughline between people in chat arguing minutiae of dps at level 40 and arguing minutiae of protein windows/exercise selection in training
[4:02:10] chobinhood_: monkaW
[4:02:15] Herby_Here: vending machine pov
[4:02:16] Reaperz_kinetic: @naturalduck arcane blast can be your most mana efficient spell and your least mana efficient spell

[4:59:55] Saltyvape: make two ranged groups of 3. Start with one group far away from the boss. He will cast static on the farthest player and the 2 closest to them. They will then stack on boss while ur group 2 takes their place far away. Rinse and repeat

One ranged from the group runs out til chain lightning, then they run in and the solo ranged on the opposite side runes out. Repeat gg. Also run the arcing lightning out into the middle

[5:01:24] BIGDAWGKEV12: Xar listen to me PLEASE. Have three range stack in one group and the other three in a group. Spread about 5-10 yards horizantally. When one of the groups get the debuff you yell "swap". Group with buff goes forward. Group without debuff goes backwards.

[5:06:34] Saltyvape: Have the tank stand against the wall to avoid the knockback.  Make two ranged groups of 3. Start with one group far away from the boss. He will cast static on the farthest player and the 2 closest to them. They will then stack on boss while ur group 2 takes their place far away. Rinse and repeat

[5:08:19] Wrestler: (2) groups of 3. they rotate in and out. if one of the melee gets static then they can just move towards a wall
[5:08:19] peanutbutta240: try that again
[5:08:19] janfritsch: y
[5:08:20] BrewTTV: You mean you're not just Yoloing it?

[5:08:20] taylorsdank: NEW PREDICT 2 MINS GO GO GO
[5:08:21] taylorsdank: NEW PREDICT 2 MINS GO GO GO
[5:08:21] wrollxx: have 1 group of 3 stay still. you and 2 other move ahead of them then behind them
[5:08:21] taylorsdank: NEW PREDICT 2 MINS GO GO GO
[5:08:21] shloom995: tank to wall @Xaryu
[5:08:22] thegoobay: just relies on 2
[5:08:23] Udenwo: lol
[5:08:24] pliley: is there something about the negative buff of the other ability? step in step out kind of thing?
[5:08:24] vino1122: its the best way
[5:08:24] vrigath: @Xaryu Easiest way is all stack on melee, 3 without debuff just move out a few meters
[5:08:24] Joeweezy24: this is the easiest fight. 2 groups of 3. furthest and closer. rotate back and forth.
[5:08:25] demoneyes1988: 2 groups
[5:08:26] Zonex2004: Including you
[5:08:29] demizt: 2 GRPS, 1 LEFT 1 RIGHT
[5:08:30] fuktskada: impossible!
[5:08:33] angelc843: lol yall are making this so much more complicated than it needs to be. just move in and out as groups of 3, have a melee sub if one of the casters get the electrical octopus.
[5:08:33] taylorsdank: NEW PREDICT 2 MINS GO GO GO
[5:08:33] ardice1: YOU DO 2 GROUPS
[5:08:33] Xbigmike17X: guzuBeliever
[5:08:34] Indomitablez: @Xaryu 6 and also if you are doing stream callout there is a slight delay
[5:08:34] Vileskin: Make two groups on a line same distance and then just one persone of each group moves out a little on rotation
[5:08:35] ninjuhh_d4: XARYU JUST READ THE CHAD. It chains to the 2 closest to the FARTHEST PERSON. so 3 total ALWAYS!!!
[5:08:36] Ramsaybolton92: u mean classic players bad ?
[5:08:36] 3c3c_: are you healing? i cant see you on dps meter monkaHmm
[5:08:37] Comanchekilo2: can’t you take the bolts and just block em?
[5:08:38] alucardwolf2: man what is this wipefest we clear all zero wipes
[5:08:40] StormshieldFaerlina: two groups back and forth. you should be the filler is someone gets the Static boy debuff
[5:08:40] ajchimica: @Xaryu you're not accounting for people moving like crazy far away when they get the aoe....that fucks everything
[5:08:41] SpaceCowboy0811: Why not just all stack? And whoever has buff move in?
[5:08:42] PapaFadi: FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW FULLY BLIND BTW

[5:08:45] xanthiizzle: wheres mitch jones>!>!
[5:08:46] Quincyheart: just set two places, one for near one for far, have debuff be in nnear, dont, be in far
[5:08:48] Shajaa: @xaryu just have 1 group move farther then closer other group don’t need to move
[5:08:50] leiferikson4541: tank on wall so heals dont get sent to max range when lightning goes out
[5:08:50] InsertYourseIf: YES RANGED STACK ON TRIANGLE
[5:08:51] calmtree: yepper
[5:08:52] ardice1: Then theyre stupid
[5:08:53] Kcandy: only one group has to move.
[5:08:55] demizt: NONONOONONONONNONON
[5:08:56] wrollxx: 2 groups but only one group moves!
[5:08:57] ardice1: and they need to fix
[5:08:57] xOutcoldx: you tank aginast wall for knockback as well so melee can feace wall then be on boss more uptime @Xaryu
[5:08:59] demizt: 1GRP LERFT 1 RIGHT
[5:09:00] Keyphor158: making groups also makes people rely on a rotation, just stack all until first one is through and then go close with debuff go far without ect
[5:09:00] inspect4: @ninjuhh_d4 try reading stream title before full caps spam
[5:09:01] espi: bloodboil it

[5:09:05] Comanchekilo2: Can you just block the bolts?

The problem is that there is no correct spelling for this informal slang translation of the Italian phrase capisci, and both spellings are common and frequently used.

[6:02:37] feistygoat37: A lot harder. They are gaslighting you
[6:02:37] pmanfit91: Yes. Gnomer is so much better in terms of mechanics and overall structure than BFD was.
[6:02:37] JustGB: those people must have not played bfd

[6:02:46] Django_7: @Xaryu i cleared gnomer with a pug 3 days into p2 in 45 minutes
[6:02:46] LxshlaYY: BFD was hard untill they nerfed it like they prolly gonna do here soon :P
[6:02:48] hot_souffle: YES
[6:02:48] naturalduck: Gnomer ACTUALLY  has personal responsibility
[6:02:49] RushedFuq: not necessarily harder but it just takes a bit coordination
[6:02:50] ripintides: bfd was piss easy so you'd assume so
[6:02:50] inspect4: u cleared bfd 2 weeks later than most probably :D
[6:02:51] prfssrzaddy: Bfd was ResidentSleeper
[6:02:53] MisterThatDude: I just one shot every boss till the last one, and then killed last boss like 3rd try, maybe I just had a solid group
[6:02:57] Spikeqc: monkaX
[6:02:58] ClassicMalcontent: Compared to BFD yes. "Hard" per se, no but mechanically more challenging than most "Classic" Content but yes it's harder than BFD.
[6:02:59] popzirl: Dust to dust pre nerf
[6:03:00] Bishox: @rexly0 this is 10x difficulty of Kelris

[6:05:08] Szmirk: overheat = dont hit dragon or sheep
[6:05:10] LatroTLI: its a melee reflect i think
[6:05:14] BlackRe3per: Overheat is a reflect on all of them when they are together
[6:05:14] hoopyfrood12: you basically are costantly going in a circle around the room
[6:05:15] pippylongshanks: music is going ham
[6:05:16] hoopyfrood12: constantly*
[6:05:17] BabaChaw: can we turn down the music?
[6:05:18] Erbsosa: people want to say bfd is harder jsut to  talk shit
[6:05:19] al_capow: you cant move from OH, one of the tanks has to sit it
[6:05:22] lotharvr: It's like those damn riders in some old raid, but here you can only 10 man it
[6:05:27] ralphh1541: overheat the dragon needs to be moved away
[6:05:28] Veriance: Yes they can
[6:05:29] JustGB: yes they can
[6:05:29] BlackRe3per: reflect is a melee reflect

[6:05:47] BlackRe3per: @Xaryu Overheat creates a melee reflect
[6:05:49] crovenkb: It's a pulsing aoe from the mob, they have to kite during overheat @Xaryu

[6:08:44] thesunnyside: @Xaryu If your shadow priest can use pom and go in the melee group the healing will be more than enough

[6:12:26] viciouswx: Just burn em down though, it's easier
[6:12:39] Butterthebun: range should stay on sheep, while melee cleave the other 3
[6:12:40] baddecisiondanx: @zonewwolfen you cannot use pom in shadow and it's 200 mana jsut to use shadowform
[6:12:47] ssiissqqoo: Lets gooo
[6:12:53] Grashh: wait people seriously using 3 healers for this fight? people just need to take less damage...
[6:13:03] AxelFromAustralia: @xaryu you have to beat last 2 bosses in one go without leaving combat to get the mount to drop, it’s like a hard mode thing
[6:13:06] slendy303030: we did it with arcane mage rdruid spriest
[6:13:08] bagelbiites: my group did 3 healers.

[6:13:23] pmanfit91: People saying that they don't need 2 healers are kinda trolling. You CAN do it with 2, but it is not fun or easy.
[6:13:23] InsertYourseIf: I did 3 healers the first lockout
[6:13:24] zonewwolfen: Bruh lmao then that priest was tripping lol
[6:13:25] Tyli67: @bagelbiites probably some noobs
[6:13:28] SpeeedYo: I think 10 druids is the strat
[6:13:29] crumbumm31: there just dying frrom stacks

[6:13:32] DiotheGod: my group had a mage and pally healer
[6:13:32] pmanfit91: 3 healers is the easiest way.

[6:49:25] yakattack1738: only dispel 8 stacks
[6:49:27] Phrosted_: you can’t expect that many dispels, priests gonna oom

[6:49:46] Butterthebun: heals look fine to me
[6:49:46] dasdevil: @xaryu fap before cast and 0 stacks
[6:49:47] zimbabjorge_: bfa music any chance @Xaryu ?
[6:49:50] jiggyspice: FAP is essential
[6:49:53] Reaperz_kinetic: theres zero reason to fap
[6:49:54] Spikeqc: WOT
[6:49:56] EmilTuT: you guys got p1 down to a tea tho
[6:49:56] wintwo: HUH

[6:49:57] Oopogo1: use freedom or fap for the frost
[6:49:58] Reaperz_kinetic: @jiggyspice not at all
[6:50:00] yakattack1738: you dont need to fap or dispel lol just stop standing in snow
[6:50:01] KissMyAstronaut: fap on 2 stacks of nova, not on 0
[6:50:02] smoore48: we didn't fap or dispel and i've cleared it twice
[6:50:05] JPeaches: Wait this run is still going?
[6:50:07] bexsteel: we’re still in gnomer?
[6:50:08] Nezzy243: OMEGALUL OMEGALUL OMEGALUL
[6:50:09] nykkjen1: You don't really need much dispell, if it reaches ( i think 12?) stacks you will get frozen  in place like an ice cube. Tanks get faster debuff so they will need dispell, dps ONLY if they get hit by bombs alot or mess up somehow @Xaryu
[6:50:10] purrfecto: fap prevents stacks
[6:50:14] pmanfit91: Your healers understand the damage coming out during P2. They'll do better this time.
[6:50:14] Reaperz_kinetic: if people do their job there is zero need to fap
[6:50:15] chriscannotstop: we all fap for 30’seconds

[6:50:33] resume___: gnome racial
[6:50:33] Gannicus_1029: it’s all about positioning it seems
[6:50:36] Reaperz_kinetic: dont be frozen so dont suck
[6:50:38] hclarsa: interupt it
[6:50:38] jiggyspice: @Reaperz_kinetic so wrong lol. The boss casts the aoe that cant be interrupted
[6:50:38] Nicholas909: DONT GET STACKS
[6:50:39] cichlidz: thats cause someone got 10 stacks
[6:50:39] zakal1337: Last boss goes down ez press all buttons as the bombs spawn
[6:50:40] Tee__Gee_: the stacks
[6:50:41] toxicdesty: dont get high stacks
[6:50:42] ipntheshower: Dont get frozen
[6:50:42] Peterpandadance: keep stacks on raid low

[6:50:45] raivven933: it oly oeshots when s1 is frozen
[6:50:46] jamieirl: also trinket if it remoeves roots/snare
[6:50:47] toxicdesty: if someone block dispel them
[6:50:47] Rebukenx: assign range to pillars
[6:50:48] Reaperz_kinetic: @jiggyspice im not wrong at all lol
[6:50:49] cichlidz: he only 1 shots when someone gets 10 stacks
[6:50:49] doomzhnwhateverrly: don’t get stacks
[6:50:49] ufotable98: MORE STACKS MORE DMG
[6:50:50] yakattack1738: at 10 stacks you get tombed and if cast goes off u wipe @Xaryu
[6:50:50] Rebukenx: they push buttons
[6:50:53] Oopogo1: the cast is kick, but only freedom the bomb assignees and tanks not the dps
[6:50:54] CripzyTV: @Xaryu its because you got too many stacks
[6:50:57] RescueRich: the ceiling fan of faces point towards where the bombs come from
[6:50:58] artarvio: you can dispell the frozen body
[6:51:02] Inclein: stand behind the froen player
[6:51:05] Inclein: frozen
[6:51:05] cheetobbob: dispell when they start moving slow which is like 5+ stacks
[6:51:05] cichlidz: you do need dispells
[6:51:06] wldot: fap if u have high stakcs
[6:51:06] aasaja10: pally freedom himself
[6:51:07] wldot: or dispells
[6:51:08] yakattack1738: you can dispel tomb
[6:51:09] sabastro007: wait for the animation and kick it
[6:51:09] wzrdaustin: If someone is frozen insta kills raid when he does that move
[6:51:09] raivven933: tank just  use freedom
[6:51:12] artarvio: but if the boss casts a spell while someone is frozen it is a raid wipe
[6:51:20] aasaja10: pally freedom himself it’s ez
[6:51:20] cichlidz: EVERY STACK INCREASES THE MELEE DAMAGE TO THE TANK
[6:51:23] sabastro007: you can kick the toxic vent aoe
[6:51:26] Reaperz_kinetic: @jiggyspice i get you think you know whats going on but you dont need to fap if you do the fight right
[6:51:27] KissMyAstronaut: put meta lock on bomb duty, will 1 shot them with searing pain
[6:51:28] wzrdaustin: If someone is frozen insta kills raid when he does that move @Xaryu
[6:51:29] jiggyspice: @Reaperz_kinetic agreeto disagree
[6:51:30] artarvio: 3rd phase has no cast bar but boss can be kicked
[6:51:42] Maistree: whats the difference between looking at a 1 minute guide to learn the fight and reading every strat from twitch chat?
[6:51:44] Hanscakestealer: is the audio distorting or is it my end
[6:51:47] Reaperz_kinetic: @jiggyspice not that kinda situation.. if you can do basic mechanics you dont need fap lol
[6:51:57] TheMadcapLizard: @Maistree more entertainment
[6:52:04] MrFocuz: the more stacks on the raid, the more dmg the boss does
[6:52:09] 000000000Machea96: @maistree strimmer engages with chat more than seeing it visually
[6:52:11] gdkpgold: @Maistree chat knows better
[6:52:13] exteps: stacks also increase dmg done to tanks
[6:52:14] BongDaRai: use fap 70%
[6:52:15] coffeenjoyer: @Maistree more interactive
[6:52:20] painkillab: jokrdChads

[6:52:29] erafor9: usurper
[6:52:37] godzillagonads: godzillagonads subscribed with Prime. 
[6:52:39] jiggyspice: @Reaperz_kinetic Cant stop the boss from aoe'ing. Faps make ph2 a walk in the park, just like kelris. But agree to disagree then bro
[6:53:11] 000000000Machea96: This type of scuffed raid content is part of why xar has thousands of viewers rn
[6:53:21] Reaperz_kinetic: @jiggyspice you can easily get out of p2 without the aoe stacks freezing you... its also easy without fap if you just dont be bad
[6:53:26] bossbonez: holy canole hi-biscus la croix is bomb
[6:53:33] Hanscakestealer: Dear future self in the year 2024 Gnomergon will be a progressive raid

[6:53:51] ctrlbeesy: music
[6:54:01] jiggyspice: @Reaperz_kinetic its not about being frozen. its about dying to the boss aoe which oneshots at 2 stacks
[6:54:07] zerozuckerl: flute ratJAM JAM
[6:54:08] riotorriot111: ratJAM
[6:54:09] ctrlbeesy: lmaoooo
