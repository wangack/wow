[1:29:11] J_eggs: @sauroun if your question is, if they are going to make "designated TBC servers", then probably not unless there is enough player base to carry

[7:43:58] Zyinxlol: blizzard has no idea how to run their game
[7:44:37] Cristav: totes
[7:44:47] CTopTV: question, how far you think they will go in classic? you think itll just keep going following the expacs or stop here
[7:44:47] Sentexqt: specs are cookie cutter in classic too though
[7:44:55] botbenjals: They won't they stated its the final chapter in the classic saga

[7:45:04] gigabubble: Haha Totes was my dude!
[7:45:08] bigskill_issue: Cata was decent in my opinion at least on the pvp front but everything after classic has been downhill for me
[7:45:09] Blaster: yup cata was like the beginning of the fall down
[7:45:11] dark_wolf68: yea but they sure make the money of those people who play
[7:45:20] Rias_TTV: There's definitely cata and mop after wrath
[7:45:21] kenjimotohh: @bubblenrun xD

[7:54:26] gigabubble: @Teagen didn't you used to run a guild on Classic? A guild that was complete cheeks? Including your Main Officer who was a ninja, who didn't even know how to play his own class? And then you completely bailed because you couldn't be as good as Swifty and get R1 in PvP
[7:54:29] ernestos1: can you ask teagan what they think about the 80 dollar classic wotlk upgrade

[7:55:06] Korben_dallas5: Why are retail players so against wrath? are they scared of it being better than retail?
[7:55:17] aviduser2: play on asmons server??
[7:55:19] gigabubble: @Capnrein Only being honest
[7:55:20] voragoretv: Are you going to level a Death Knight @Swifty :)

[7:56:06] Teagens: Need to check your facts my dude lol
