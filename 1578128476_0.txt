[1:28:48] sauroun: @StimpletonTV yeah i get what you mean, mb im confusing 2 diferent things (servers and launchers)
[1:29:11] J_eggs: @sauroun if your question is, if they are going to make "designated TBC servers", then probably not unless there is enough player base to carry
[1:29:19] luchion09: WHATS BENediction?

[7:54:26] gigabubble: @Teagen didn't you used to run a guild on Classic? A guild that was complete cheeks? Including your Main Officer who was a ninja, who didn't even know how to play his own class? And then you completely bailed because you couldn't be as good as Swifty and get R1 in PvP
[7:54:29] ernestos1: can you ask teagan what they think about the 80 dollar classic wotlk upgrade

[7:55:06] Korben_dallas5: Why are retail players so against wrath? are they scared of it being better than retail?
[7:55:17] aviduser2: play on asmons server??
[7:55:19] gigabubble: @Capnrein Only being honest
[7:55:20] voragoretv: Are you going to level a Death Knight @Swifty :)
[7:55:21] aviduser2: the big streamer server
[7:55:24] thomasthepainengine: POG making a fresh human rn myself
