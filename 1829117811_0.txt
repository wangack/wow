[0:58:03] Haseyah: for sure try
[0:58:09] juansr94: Not appealable, there are mobs there, you just can see them and you aoe them
[0:58:09] Vigilant87: Its a part of the game. Not appealable
[0:58:11] nasdaquez: you aoed mobs, that killed you, harsh way to learn about dangers of undercity
[0:58:11] Retz1t: thats not a bug, its easter egg by blizz and part of lore
[0:58:13] tsomi88: i dont think you can under 20 lvl
[0:58:13] juansr94: Its not a bug
[0:58:17] Vigilant87: unfortunately
[0:58:23] juansr94: Can't*
[0:58:25] Karma_84: Can't appeal lack of knowledge on those enemies tbh
[0:58:27] SidecarShrimp: it's not a bug
[0:58:28] TenebruhTV: Been there since 04'
[0:58:33] fractalshow: Start over
[0:58:33] erectiliann: It’s not a legitimate appeal unfortunately as BS as it is.
[0:58:54] dispensaryttv: WE GO AGANE
[0:58:54] Cowardpatty: Imagine playing a different game, and you died to 'nothing', and everyone tells you "Oh yeah, that's a thing.  Invisible mob that you can't fight, but can kill you.".  It's pretty stupid.
[0:58:57] Mibbido: hahaha

[1:00:40] juansr94: Its not appealable, since its not a bug, its working as intended. Invisible mobs there, there is couple of quests mentioning them and the lore
[1:00:45] Porkypine666: you cant appeal under 20 and he didnt DC or get griefed
[1:00:50] fractalshow: Alt f4 for discord appeal xd

[1:02:14] ACGxCronkite: the unseen, theres mobs in the ruins of lordaeron that are neutral, you aggrod them
[1:02:16] Koopa_Troopa000: @Pallyofhell ????
[1:02:18] xttjordan: #HC
[1:02:20] VladdTheInhalerr: @Pallyofhell are you ok?
[1:02:21] tankatrono_o: There actually is invisible ghosts in undercity which you can aggro with AoE spells. no joke, i learned about it like a couple of months ago and enver knew it
[1:02:25] Fisher145TV: my mage also just died I feel for you we are in this together. I just restarted
[1:02:30] BlitzcominTwitch: i always remember being able to see the ghosts :/ unless they changed it in TBC

[1:03:37] Teagens: Wait
[1:03:37] Teagens: Wait
[1:03:37] Cowardpatty: Imagine playing Diablo 4 hard core and you are going to kill Lilith and just drop dead suddenly, and someone says "Oh yeah!  There are invisible diablos here.  You didn't know that????"  It's really dumb.
[1:03:38] Teagens: No
[1:03:41] Retz1t: alliance andy trying to appeal because dont know horde things lul
[1:03:41] Teagens: No way
[1:03:44] thehorseisbrown: undercity*
[1:03:44] Teagens: WHAT HAPPENED!?
[1:03:49] quenzar: Probably not appealable unfortunately
[1:03:59] younglettuc: Ghosts got him

[1:04:49] Teagens: Wtf happened
[1:04:53] khalil_okami: Combat Log?
[1:04:55] PumaMist: #whoyougunnacall - ghost busters
[1:04:55] Cowardpatty: I've seen a lot of BS stuff in WoW, but this is probably #1.
[1:05:06] nuetrinosrus: Nothing in combat log
[1:05:08] Haseyah: nothing in combat logs
[1:05:09] Retz1t: :DDD
[1:05:10] Sdeleon159: I go afk for 10 min and you die?! swiftyFacepalm
[1:05:12] nuetrinosrus: Just that he died
[1:05:30] Lilykoi: that was loud..
[1:05:45] younglettuc: @teagens He agreed the invisible ghosts in underditt doing arcane explosion and they killed him
[1:05:45] Aldever13: appeal
[1:05:49] quenzar: No way that’s appealable
[1:05:52] fractalshow: New char
[1:06:03] mideiv: Find ghost as ghost
[1:06:17] khalil_okami: share link to clip?
[1:06:26] lahuskie: @Swifty this is the discord ***
[1:06:36] Cowardpatty: Here is a clip if you need it.  https://clips.twitch.tv/TubularHandsomeDogSmoocherZ-7w3TfhBKboTAJQF1
[1:07:04] BlitzcominTwitch: there wibsite has it squifty, at the botom
[1:07:05] JoeFoo: LUL
[1:07:08] UrsineTV: the discord name is called Classic Hardcore
[1:07:08] quenzar: What’s next then? Back to the rogue?
[1:07:08] juansr94: But why appealing mate? There is not a bug/dc involved, neither pvp scam or smthing like that
[1:07:09] lahuskie: discord . gg / classichc
[1:07:09] emrys2100: A similar appeal was denied
[1:07:12] neftario105: Diablo 4 next week
[1:07:14] fractalshow: Relax chat
[1:07:14] SpaltZzz: you died to an invisible mob called the unseen. Its level 46-51 and it will not be appealable. Thats BS tho
[1:07:16] UrsineTV: if you go to the rules werbsite you can get into it fro mthere
[1:07:25] BlitzcominTwitch: yes thats it
[1:07:37] neftario105: borring coming back later
[1:07:47] Retz1t: can u give us a reasonable explanation why are u appealing this death?
[1:08:01] naionen: swifty the discord is on the website
[1:08:03] Aldever13: appeal Yeah
[1:08:06] naionen: at the top
[1:08:08] Chris_Cringle: shift+enter to go down a line without posting
[1:08:08] Cowardpatty: @Vizkazjr  Why?  He didn't know that was there.  It's an invisible mob that he has never aggro'd in almost 20 years of playing the game.  You think he should be punished for randomly pressing Arcane Explosion where there are no enemies around?
[1:08:33] nuetrinosrus: Or anything in combat log
[1:08:47] nuetrinosrus: It would be fair if he could see what he died from
[1:09:00] Starshards: You pulled the invisible mob dude
[1:09:07] Cowardpatty: I don't know, people can have their own opinions, but I think that death was BS.
[1:09:17] Starshards: I saw a clip on youtube where the exact same thing happened
[1:09:25] mysteryrage: IS the hardcore challange done just through addons and classic wow or soemthing else?
[1:09:25] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:09:26] lahuskie: Fallen Empire HC
[1:09:36] Alloken: U have to go AGANE swifty no streamer advantages :D
[1:09:44] nuetrinosrus: Well let’s let the HC determine if it’s fair or unfair with the appeal
[1:09:49] lahuskie: @Swifty guild name is Fallen Empire HC
[1:09:53] BlitzcominTwitch: the disconnect deaths only have a lvl20+ requirement. thats the only lvl requirement appeal
[1:09:54] nuetrinosrus: If not the all well
[1:09:58] Alloken: LUL
[1:09:58] nuetrinosrus: We go again
[1:10:07] juansr94: @cowardpatty its not about punishment, he just died by an intentional feature of the game. There is no Bug, no DC, no scampvp. He just die from something he didnt know about, its not appealable. Its like not knowing there is fall damage, you can't appeal a fall damage dead cause you didnt know
[1:10:09] EsdeseVes: GUILD !! no guid BibleThump
[1:10:11] Hanomag: Peanut privilege

[1:10:43] younglettuc: Computer bugged out and started casting arcane explosion
[1:10:43] nuetrinosrus: #teamswifty
[1:10:52] BlitzcominTwitch: just say invisible to the human eye.
[1:10:56] nuetrinosrus: Haha
[1:10:59] Aldever13: not go again
[1:11:00] lahuskie: Wrong guild name @Swifty

[1:12:08] Bobbywalt: i just joined what the hell happened
[1:12:09] KhaosDryad: Clearly says Fallen Empire HC over your character.
[1:12:10] nuetrinosrus: You guys probably appeal to dying to prowlers at lvl 10 so chill lol
[1:12:15] lahuskie: lol
[1:12:18] Bobbywalt: is it goodbye aoe strats
[1:12:22] nasdaquez: goldfish moment
[1:12:27] Retz1t: being very reasonable and honest person, it feels weird that u try to appeal this without explanation
[1:12:36] bnpeki: no.
[1:12:43] nuetrinosrus: HAHAHA
[1:12:43] juansr94: KEKW
[1:12:48] buffmonkey123: smash his house!
[1:12:49] Cowardpatty: How dare this person!!!  lol
[1:12:49] nuetrinosrus: Rip
[1:12:49] BlitzcominTwitch: he has no roles
[1:12:54] PhantumElo: Thats not a mod tho
[1:12:54] Cowardpatty: Poor Swifty

[1:13:21] Cowardpatty: Maybe that guy will stump his big toe, and then he can try to appeal that!
[1:13:26] jaredd80: ask, do he know who you are...
[1:13:40] Op7ima9010: Maybe before 12 years ago you killed him with your Nelf Warrior and he is still mad :D
[1:13:49] Cowardpatty: @Op7ima9010  LOL
[1:13:51] HitmanGSMike: swiftyPsad

[1:17:20] Cowardpatty: If I was playing HC and this happened to me, I would not have handled it as well as Swifty.  I probably would have thrown my keyboard.
[1:17:25] aussiebelle: Is the appeal through blizzard?
[1:17:27] Kairen_Gilliard: Wanna see Undead Swiflock :)

[1:19:49] Hoddyjones: haz un stream en español algun dia porfa :D
[1:19:52] VeniVidiVici401TV: That should be appealable
[1:19:52] Cowardpatty: @eckimo7  This isn't a normal death though.

[1:19:59] VeniVidiVici401TV: thats dumb its not
[1:20:01] nuetrinosrus: Undercity
[1:20:03] BlitzFrank: you attacked the mobs
[1:20:03] AussieDave1980: Blizzard created a last resort of defense in UC, an invisible ghost that hit stupidly hard.
[1:20:06] Aldever13: the legend never dies.
[1:20:19] choppinemup: LUL
[1:20:21] wombomaster: "you gotta go to bed"

[1:21:15] Cowardpatty: @eckimo7  Yeah, but you can't see it, or play around it, if you weren't one of the few people who knew about it.  I think most people would agree this isn't your standard death where you just 'get over it'.
[1:21:16] jrtraderz: yes i know but no monster kill you
[1:21:17] nuetrinosrus: No luck on the appeal

[1:21:30] buffmonkey123: I feel like you should be able to send the gold to your new char when you die
[1:21:47] wombomaster: @venividivici401 No
[1:21:50] Deathmann76: You can't open tickit about it
[1:21:50] wombomaster: Clear bug, no?
[1:21:53] BlitzcominTwitch: @aussiebelle appeal was rejected by mod on the discord

[2:18:45] Trimethicon: No

[4:17:42] c620w: no
[4:17:56] c620w: :/
[4:18:00] c620w: they need to make a new hc sver
[4:18:00] noenken: HC with WoW token ..... LOL
[4:18:05] k4bigon_: which is why they need to hardcode the HC rules as they exist.
[4:18:18] f1recrotch: @Swifty sucks for all the guys lvl 60 that wont be able to transfer
[4:18:21] guss2084: won't happen.  HC needs to have its own economy. unless they keep is Self found like current addon
[4:18:43] k4bigon_: Do it like runescape
[4:18:46] machine_723: if its a fresh hc server ah and trading is fine in my opinion
[4:18:48] k4bigon_: Different levels of Hardcore
[4:18:48] Chosey: people will just dungeon spam and never die
[4:18:55] BoricuaSJ: so what you think of wow token in Classic ?
[4:18:57] Sphinx2k: If the whole server is HC then it will run itself..
[4:19:00] Cowardpatty: The only reason this whole fad has taken off is because of the HC community, so if Bliz is smart, they will mimic the current HC rules
[4:19:19] JattixTV: I think a few of the HC rules are bit much in my opinion

[4:20:00] Chosey: theres no way to enforce that though lol

[4:20:23] Thorxs: like HS etc
[4:20:27] f1recrotch: @Swifty yeah thats what im saying, I think they should be able to do consumables but not trade items, because people will just hold items to trade until dungeons

[4:20:38] Chosey: @Thorxs and how would you enforce that?
[4:20:56] drchadicussex: I think a bunch of rules could be put in place. First u cant group or trade with players -/+ 5 lvls. Items that have been traded once turn souldbound. No auction House. No Gold trading, so essentially bartering. This is to prevent RMT.

[4:21:58] Cowardpatty: If I was making the HC servers, they'd be awesome. Lots of custom changes.  I doubt Bliz wants to put that much effort/time into it.
[4:22:26] drchadicussex: Yea, BLizz will do bare minimum.
[4:22:31] plasticbus: But did you go to bed?

[4:23:54] Chosey: they're doing a new server, like SOM
[4:24:03] Deatth1: What happened to the human mage?
[4:24:05] Thorxs: i thihhnk blizzard are setting themself up for disappointment if they dont give new servers and lettinvg everyone believe they are with all the streamers saying it
[4:24:23] Chosey: they were fresh servers
[4:24:27] drchadicussex: Maybe i am putting to much faith in blizz, but they gotta make a dedicated server or they have really messed up
