[1:44:48] thebakeriscomingforu: it would drastically change things if those guilds could only run splits with other participants in the race
[1:44:51] Stinnkey: and CN
[1:45:08] Dagomarus: Yeah some alchemists were having echos life  on prices so they had to get in house alchemist to make pots and stuff
[1:45:09] nomithergaming: Method has Sco PogChamp

[1:47:50] Dagomarus: I think its towellie backwards @voltaictv
[1:47:51] ThePawPaw: @Sollice
[1:47:59] SinicalDev: theyd just end up doing nefarious strategies like account sharing and stuff
[1:48:00] idenkaz_: maybe get more people and actually pay them that are just their to save lockouts. like an actual employee
[1:48:07] Aervyper: @Towelliee but the splits i am sure are mathimatically caluclated. I assume 6-8 mains is the sweet spot to funnel

[1:49:02] Screamnsteam: mods EZ
[1:49:06] Irhamel: while that its somewhat ok, and understandable, that type of gear-rushing to me, beats the purpose of the game, but I guess, competitive clubs like liquid, methods, etc, care not for the "game" as is, so much as just that "achievement"
[1:49:11] KnsWoW: Good Morning everyone!

[1:49:43] ThePawPaw: same
[1:49:46] Stinnkey: @SinicalDev I dont think they would risk that, they are always under big scrutiny from Blizzard and ever since the RMT ban to Limit a few years back no one messes with ToS anymore.
[1:49:53] derry10: that action could just be "nothing" which is an action
[1:49:54] ThePawPaw: but they still showing up

[1:55:36] duffluv22: Do you ever fail keys?
[1:55:43] captainkippysmith: It’s so nice that you can just keys and raid and not need to worry about any other grinds
[1:55:49] captainkippysmith: Run
[1:56:05] swagstaff_gaming: rating not big enough for towel daddy lol
[1:56:08] Exodeo_: poor shammy
[1:56:16] 0doz: "and a hunter" .. lol
[1:56:16] Voltaictv: Tip for the 2nd boss, if you max the stacks on one of the two, they also deal 0 dmg while they are immune
[1:56:31] LouisWu73: oh well, one day
[1:56:34] Respls: the only time I have an issue with thundering is on the odyn fight when we have to go to the runes
[1:56:39] nomithergaming: really
[1:56:46] dimofodi: @towelliee then tweeted switch at 10 stacks and the damage coming out is minimal, only did 40k hps in a 17
[1:56:47] idenkaz_: its actually more common than you think
[1:56:47] CloudPants8081: towShappens
[1:56:50] captiv8: makes sense
[1:56:51] Stinnkey: its considered RMT
[1:56:59] deedeemegadoodooo: "viewer raid"
[1:57:15] nomithergaming: POG
[1:57:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: thats blizzard getting money not you LUL
[1:57:22] Scarhearth: But what if I forget that im subbed does it still count as rmt
[1:57:25] Ezekyler: it's money for them
[1:57:28] nomithergaming: mount collectors rejoice
[1:57:28] dimofodi: they don't have a problem because they're making the money
[1:57:29] kyr_slowbro: Once u cut Blizz out, it's bad
[1:57:32] DarkMoonDragons: technically your paying the veiwer then
[1:57:32] Aquadriel: because you are giving money not us kek

[1:57:34] firewalltwitch: they look the other way for that Kappa
[1:57:35] LouisWu73: so you can give to us, but we cant give to you
[1:57:36] ahies28: its strange
[1:57:39] captiv8: thats because you are giving away, not receiving money
[1:57:40] Aervyper: @Towelliee would be super hard to prove doubt blizz could get enough information to difinitively prove
[1:57:47] Brodih_: Blizz can profit from that because that player could buy stuff or stay subbed
[1:57:53] CloudPants8081: towBolvar
[1:58:10] Stinnkey: Same thing as if you gifted a store mount to someone for boosting. As long as it isnt a cash deal they dont care ig, youre doing it for an item trasnaction instead of cash
[1:58:14] nomithergaming: technically if you make any money its RMT
[1:58:15] Cabbageman007: Sub luck
[1:58:32] Respls: they had sub luck that added like 10-30 percent chance to get in
[1:58:33] dimofodi: can also do a sub only stream, delete the vod etc
[1:58:36] HaxzorJimDuggan: its a secret to everybody
[1:59:01] dimofodi: they literally banned streamers who gave extra luck protection in roll bots not even guaranteeing runs to subs lol
[2:00:35] Scarhearth: Honestly i never saw the reason for "sub luck" to be something to lose minds over
[2:01:01] Scarhearth: RNG is RNG doesnt matter if you have a +30% chance to luck you can still roll a 0
[2:01:13] Sollice: I need to see if I can embed that raider.io twitch extension in to the website. That thing is nice

[2:10:15] landonconnor: That 2nd boss is ez
[2:10:17] Melonbrew: Do you just need to get 2k IO for KSM?
[2:10:22] gelimarr: DONT DIE

[2:11:11] Brodih_: just noticed that bdgg is down to 15% nice

[2:11:23] LouisWu73: ah ok

[2:36:33] cazhually: method getting 3rd or 4th is a huge W
[2:36:36] Stinnkey: @zysmos How? they are fighting for world 3rd?? the only reason they got world second in SoF was bc Liquid stopped raiding for 3 days lmao
[2:36:36] reggiepowa: considering the amount of time they are playing they are not doing that great
[2:36:38] im_capy: Scott retired too
[2:36:43] kimmo_gaming: And be realistic, Method is not the same guild as they were 5 years aggo
[2:36:53] Aervyper: @Towelliee i swear everyone forgets that Echo is literally 80% of method and people complain about method.  It's mind boggling
[2:37:01] reggiepowa: they played the entire christmas and they have nothing to show for it
[2:37:07] Hybridwarhawk: Jesus, lots of method haters this morning apparently
[2:37:13] sklingel: if your not first your last
[2:37:15] zysmos: There was no way but it feels like they got it all wrong just look at their comp only guild not running a prot warrior, double lock when max said they were pretty bad this tier, i don't know it feels like they fucked up
[2:37:20] Shablagoosh: liquid got 5th in sepulcher though didnt they?
[2:37:21] Brodih_: wasent Echo born from Methods disband a couple of years ago?
[2:37:32] fluh_: they thought since liquid gave up and they got 2nd last tier they would place better this tier lol
[2:37:33] reggiepowa: if bdgg gets 3rd with 2 day break then that bad
[2:37:52] cazhually: why are they doing prot pally?
[2:37:54] dreamwalker213: The fact that method had to basically rebuild from the ground up and still be top 3-5 every tier is remarkable
[2:37:56] gelimarr: prot warr ftw
[2:37:58] Aervyper: @Qazh_ all of method WENT to echo except for Sco
[2:38:03] letrickyxd: yeah prot palli very good in M+, just not as good in raid

[3:25:52] xeavv: Tier is on a different loot table isnt it? You used to also get it from the pvp vault options
[3:25:58] faulen: If you had to kill the boss, you could target pieces by just killing that one boss.
[3:25:59] aminus: so you can get tier from bosses you haven't killed, but not normal gear
[3:26:00] palasuun: tier is open to all content
[3:26:00] Skylin3r: talking to Pereadin ;p
[3:26:03] chazavier: how do you guys take care of loot in prog raids toweliee?

[3:26:13] pereadin: I think they’re talking to me @towelliee my 970 is giving me issues.

[3:58:42] letrickyxd: @andres_1123 that wasn't the liquid guild, that was Steve owner of Liquid
[3:58:42] DoughBoi_Trev: @andres_1123 well I mean Naowh is a team hopper
[3:58:49] jaypee522: we got a realm list
[3:58:51] BullDevil: @andres_1123 except no one said it was luck....
[3:58:52] DogShep: Still down but realm list just came up

[3:58:57] ClassicMalcontent: Well. Wrath classic is up. Retail you can login and see the server list at least for NA.
[3:58:59] SeckSymbols: @andres_1123 Naowh would be saying the same thing if the tables were turned and Liquid got their kill while Echo was asleep. They're just using their win as an excuse to be happy
[3:59:00] snake_like: trill doing arena championships at night, world first raiding during the day. guy was run ragged
[3:59:12] Meanseason: what are the chances skyline could get WF if global release existed.
[3:59:13] zeitgeiz: real list is up
[3:59:15] zeitgeiz: so soon
[3:59:19] zeitgeiz: *real
[3:59:20] mazamune: so happy to see frost possibly in a better spot
[3:59:23] guuchwax: max didnt seem to want anything to do w/ echo after the race. didnt want to talk to scripe or roger again like before
[3:59:26] zeitgeiz: *realm son of a
[3:59:29] SinicalDev: the server engineers still drunk from xmas so forgot to switch them back on
[3:59:39] devoted_bee: Looking forward to vicariously watch Towelliee get big loot :)
[3:59:41] pereadin: Thanks to Sollice, Skylin3r and everyone else who reached out to me in DMs about my graphics card issues. It turns out my 970 is truly dead.
[3:59:46] letrickyxd: it was owner of Liquid
[3:59:52] BullDevil: it was some liquid owner, nothing to do with the guild
[3:59:57] ApocJosh: @zeitgeiz cheers :)
[4:00:00] swampt1l: I think owner
[4:00:01] BullDevil: no one in the guild said it was luck
[4:00:04] Funderik: yes it was someone in liquid that has no idea how shit works in wow.
[4:00:08] manmower: I don't think Blizzard will roll out a nerf like that again mid-race
[4:00:10] Roenoake: Yah they should focus on the people from the guild not the owner of the team
[4:00:10] Sollice: @pereadin uGH thats not good
[4:00:11] Holysal: @guuchwax they dont like each other. idk why but something happened
[4:00:13] Tippolski: @pereadin :( at least you know whats happened. Sorry friend
[4:00:28] Phoxzy: Maybe so, but let's say both teams knew about the changes, and they started at the exact global time, who would have taken the win? Im a fan of liquid but Method out  played them.
[4:00:29] Ploxceee: heroic loot foor weekly 4 mythics done ?
[4:00:31] SneakyPenguin25: servers went down while i was hearthing. is my character gonna be stuck in da in between?
[4:00:34] DrkPhoenix6913: Max said it best:  No matter when the nerf went out - someone was going to get pisssed/screwed by it
[4:00:37] Rictamar: The Liquid owner is sweating because his esports lost again lol despite the actual guild not being salty or throwing shade at all. He's a clown
[4:00:38] andres_1123: There was some tension and beef going on during season 4 shadowlands tho, where liquid was very open about disliking a lot of echo players
[4:00:41] Revoca: @manmower from my understanding this happens all the time
[4:00:45] SinicalDev: It's not even an official esport, not sure why they're crying about it from a commercial angle
[4:00:49] gelimarr: @Towelliee Any WoWhead news?
[4:00:50] SeckSymbols: @guuchwax Max just doesnt want to discuss a race where a boss was nerfed with incredibly unfortunate timing
[4:00:57] andres_1123: I think it was right before MDI
[4:01:04] manmower: imagine you were in a CS go match and they changed how much damage weapons did, it's just not designed as an eSport
[4:01:08] Ultratide_: They didnt get unlucky though, naowh was right
[4:01:11] pereadin: @tippolski @sollice yeah gonna have to figure something out in the meantime till I can get a replacement.
[4:01:11] SeckSymbols: @manmower Not of this magnitude, the nerf the implemented was massive
[4:01:21] ShadesOBlue: anduin *cough*

[4:01:25] emznev: towNut1
[4:01:32] Funderik: was still a discredit either way. it was a few from outside the wow guild that are "liquid" that spoke out.
[4:01:32] Hammerify: he owns liquid
[4:01:37] old_kansas_heini: so echo needed over 100 pulls less than liquids ther are no doubts lingering and no questions remaining, that it was well deserved for echo
[4:01:43] convrge: apparently theres a quest you can get in valk to complete 4 mythic dungeons for a piece of 408 gear thatll be available this week
[4:01:45] Sollice: @pereadin may be able to pickup something cheap used locally? How do yo uknow its dead for sure. Are you able to test it somewhere else
[4:01:51] GrampyBeav: TOWELLIEES THE BEST
[4:01:54] Tippolski: @pereadin If you have a somewhat newer CPU, I imagine you can utilize CPU graphic power until you can grab a new card? Check your motherboard inputs
[4:01:54] manmower: @SeckSymbols agreed, whoever was warmed up and on the boss when the nerf dropped would have won

[4:01:56] nilachip: sore loser
[4:01:58] SeckSymbols: Liquid got unlucky on nerf timing
[4:02:02] DavidBrutal123: nothing to do with luck
[4:02:04] Goatsguffle: People wil;l find a way to get offended if they want to
[4:02:07] Jarlan23: @Towelliee do you know if the creation catalyst will work with crafted items
[4:02:09] Ploxceee: but its not like Liquid killed it the 2nd pull like echo did .
[4:02:09] Merqury3: Even Max said Echo just performed much better on Rasz overall
[4:02:16] zeitgeiz: that's a dig at blizz if anything. blizz is the reason it came down to who was playing when a hotfix came in
[4:02:16] EllisTheMenace1: Next time they shouldnt sleep if blizzard are awake
[4:02:20] EllisTheMenace1: they got 2 hours noticed
[4:02:22] Gingerprimer: Yeah in the replies he even agrees with Naowh
[4:02:22] nilachip: not reallt but let them think thjat
[4:02:23] EllisTheMenace1: and stayed in bed
[4:02:24] ItsGigg: Lol, literally. You snooze you lose
[4:02:24] Funderik: also unlucky they took 4.5 hours of wiping after the nerf.
[4:02:25] DeathWarrant21: people talking pull counts have zero clue about how rwf goes
[4:02:25] BestoftheWurst: Everyone acting like they have never been a sore loser! haha
[4:02:26] dpbdagger: yeah i dont think anything is offensive there lol
[4:02:33] Ultratide_: naowh said nothing bad though?
[4:02:34] Febreze1212: @jarlan23  I heard end of January
[4:02:35] NVbrutal: if liquid killed raz the next pull after nerf then ya but it still took them 3 hours or so i think to kill raz after the nerf compared to echos 1 attempt after.
[4:02:36] xhaven: I enjoyed the race no matter what! Hope next one is even better.
[4:02:39] old_kansas_heini: and at the time echo killed the boss liquid was playing aswell
[4:02:39] Exxcar: @EllisTheMenace1 Blizzard is 24/7
[4:02:44] SeckSymbols: @Ploxceee Echo also had 8+ hours worth of warmup pulls
[4:02:46] Fat_Thor2: hey man really like your UI set up
[4:02:46] zeitgeiz: i knew after the first day or two of prog that it was going to come down to when a hotfix came in.
[4:02:51] andres_1123: For sure, but there was some posts about liquid being open about disliking some of echos players, it was during season 4 last expac
[4:02:51] pereadin: @sollice I plugged it into my wife’s computer and same issue.
[4:02:54] Glisur85: Good morning Towelliee, good morning chat
[4:02:56] BestoftheWurst: Morning @Towelliee happy reset day!
[4:02:57] ThePawPaw: blobDance
[4:02:58] roflpotamus: EU love their dance music
[4:03:00] Sollice: @pereadin Ahh man.
[4:03:01] Hammerify: what time did that nerf actually drop?
[4:03:02] Draz3nx: why does blizzard nerf like that leave it alone
[4:03:02] gelimarr: Wowhead
[4:03:04] manmower: we'll see how well they do in the Gnoll raid next tier
[4:03:09] Revoca: @old_kansas_heini i mean they deserved the killed but only got it cause of the nerf timing .. liquid was literally pulling a boss that couldnt  die before the nerf
[4:03:12] Megadisaster24: I mean, it's kinda awful to push a nerf when One of the Two 7/8 guilds was currently doing the boss.
[4:03:14] Nehcrom: Mood to raid? towRed towRed towRed towRed
[4:03:16] KronasKG: @Towelliee  If they want to make sure its always 100% fair. There needs to be a tourney Realm and they need to get on the same play schedule... Start at the same time and if they sleep they sleep. Nerfs will be described and released at a known time.
[4:03:18] Cabbageman007: Any Epic Cards from Xmas?  Opened Packs?
[4:03:23] DeathWarrant21: @nvbrutal echo were actively attempting raz for hours though. big difference
[4:03:29] Rudric_Ice: is Naowh the CEO of twitter ?
[4:03:31] ravenwingz0405: @pereadin you have a micro center near you?
[4:03:31] crzd384: thanking them for a great race?
[4:03:35] KronasKG: However everyone wants blizz wants to stay out
[4:03:36] crzd384: that guys an idiot lol
[4:03:37] roflpotamus: Love seeing Fraggy back on method
[4:03:38] Sollice: They aren't going to do a tourney realm because that will leave out other people
[4:03:43] Ploxceee: @Ploxceee Liquid had more pulls then them though no? at that point?
[4:03:43] SeckSymbols: Naowh coming off as a sore winner in that exchange
[4:03:49] ApeManXXL: just becasue you dont praise someone , dosent mean you were talking shit
[4:03:50] Gingerprimer: Steve is very involved with his team aswell
[4:03:51] Nehcrom: This is a storm in a glass of water :-)
[4:03:51] Funderik: what it sounds like to me is the big boys are luquid franchise were sold a dream that RWF was some big profit blizzard thing for them.
[4:03:54] GrampyBeav: How’s the server status
[4:04:03] Sollice: They are down in NA
[4:04:03] fluh_: soft af
[4:04:05] DarkMoonDragons: wasn't there a stealth nerf put in?
[4:04:06] EllisTheMenace1: @Exxcar not when it comes to hotfix they allways do it during normal work hours unless somthing is game breaking even max said next time they wont sleep when blizard are in office
[4:04:10] ShadesOBlue: ceo's are usually sociopaths
[4:04:12] emznev: @secksymbols FootYellow
[4:04:13] breadwilton: Ya I dont blame Echo definitely doesnt feel like they got world first
[4:04:15] letrickyxd: @Ploxceee echo are known to take long breaks between pulls
[4:04:15] N3llee: but max would never say that
[4:04:19] breadwilton: Just feels like it was handed to them
[4:04:21] andres_1123: I think he was just emotional and burnt out because that kill looked fucking draining and he was prob upset he wasnt recieving his flowers
[4:04:23] gelimarr: lets go Echo
[4:04:28] roflpotamus: True lol
[4:04:29] Exxcar: @EllisTheMenace1 They litterally just didn't
[4:04:30] hipvanilla: That will happen anyway =)
[4:04:31] letrickyxd: @Ploxceee However, Max admitted that Echo just played the final boss better in general
[4:04:32] dpbdagger: realm list up
[4:04:38] kogerah_: he stated he felt bad about how they won, he thought they could have killed it without nerfs
[4:04:41] sooziecuzie: There's been extra heat since Gingi accused Liquit of faking something on Anduin.
[4:04:41] Sollice: @EllisTheMenace1 This is the part I DO NOT understand. The hotfix went in normal Blizzard working hours. This was an easy thing to predict and they should have been ready for sure
[4:04:43] Ultratide_: @Lovaclol KEKW
[4:04:44] Exxcar: They litterraly just hotfixed M Raz during EU times
[4:04:46] ClubsSC: max is too chill to pop off with something like that
[4:04:47] Ploxceee: as a NA wow player i am a Echo enjoyer
[4:04:48] pereadin: @ravenwingz0405 yeah but no way to get there. Haven’t had a car in about a year and only way to get there is via car
[4:04:48] SeckSymbols: @Ploxceee Pull count andy's are fucking weird
[4:04:49] manmower: would you rather lose to Blizzard or lose to a competitor? which stings less?
[4:04:55] Yurian33: witch

[4:04:58] EllisTheMenace1: @Lovaclol are you mad? it took them 5 hours after to kill it
[4:05:11] Gingerprimer: @SeckSymbols big yes
[4:05:13] druidhex: Towlee is my idol shhhh dont tell him he is away
[4:05:21] Rictamar: Some idiot chatter really just said "Echo's win was handed to them" LUL absolute clown take
[4:05:26] Ploxceee: @SeckSymbols i mean idc i think echo just did better lol you said Warm up pulls not me :)
[4:05:27] infektyd: as an NA player that wants liquid to win, echo simply played better, and probbaly would of taken WF even if they didnt nerf it
[4:05:29] DeathWarrant21: @sollice but it wasn't expected though, max said the notice came 2 hours before they woke up and was implemented 1.5 hours later
[4:05:32] xhaven: I do not want blizz to be any more involved in RWF at all lol.
[4:05:36] Holysal: who cares the rwf sucked ass this year. lets move on LUL
[4:05:38] andres_1123: I miss fragnance on echo... such a wasted player on method tbh
[4:05:42] Ultratide_: they gotta be trolling KEKW
[4:05:47] Moronil: echo needed just 1 pull to kill raz after the nerf, they're def the best guild worldwide
[4:05:48] Jarlan23: i love the drama after every wfr its funny af
[4:05:51] SeckSymbols: @Lovaclol Are you mad? Echo had 8 hours a warmup pulls while Liquid came in deflated and having just woken up
[4:05:51] Bulgogiprince: No offense if Echo got the kill like they did. It would be hard for anyone to clear it after them. Demoralizing.
[4:05:51] andres_1123: I do think he will make the move back later in the expac tho
[4:05:55] Sollice: @DeathWarrant21 Why should he "expect" it? Shouldn't you "anticiipate" it?
[4:05:59] EllisTheMenace1: @Sollice agreed why was limit sleeping, at that time also max said they got told 2 hours before he went live and he went live 10 mins after echo killed it soo.. limit letgit got caught sleeping
[4:06:02] DoughBoi_Trev: @gylduran yet all the nerfs came when liquid were asleep especially the last raz nerf that gave them the kill
[4:06:15] gelimarr: Echo is the best
[4:06:19] DoughBoi_Trev: @gylduran you are a absolute clown if you don't think so
[4:06:22] Ultratide_: @DoughBoi_Trev KEKW
[4:06:34] andres_1123: echo simply played better, they caught -1 day
[4:06:35] EllisTheMenace1: if your going to world first you should anticipate stuff like hotfix during bllizzrd hours
[4:06:39] Jarlan23: @Gemmeke liquid is the best u wanna fite about it?
[4:06:49] Rudric_Ice: anyone heere played Snowrunner ?
[4:06:53] Sollice: Bottom line is nothing will ever be "fair or equal" in ANYONES eyes until worldwide release and these conversations are always pointless
[4:07:03] moa285: I don't know why you're even bringing this up. Most people don't even seem to know what happened in the boss fight. Let alone recognize who had the better execution.
[4:07:05] notorietyy: the fuck is going on in this chat right now lol
[4:07:05] Rictamar: @DoughBoi_Trev Look at the entire race my dude, Echo played better and proved to be the better guild. Not to mention the other races Take the L salty NA fanboy
[4:07:07] letrickyxd: @DoughBoi_Trev you're a clown if you think it was handed
[4:07:14] xhaven: @DoughBoi_Trev that is false info, there were nerfs when it was Echo's downtime as well.
[4:07:16] cinnamints: @EllisTheMenace1 I don't think anyone is mad, it was just anticlimactic. Liquid changed their sleep hours to avoid maint downtime. They'd gone to sleep 5% ahead of Echo. They woke up early (for their schedule) to continue the race & the nerfs went in before they got to the facility. Of course it took them hours to get back into the mindset to finish.
[4:07:17] DeathWarrant21: @sollice can't anticipate it for a specific day or time. Hotfixes could have happened at any time and any day.
[4:07:25] Funderik: @Bulgogiprince that sounds like a mentallity thing that lquid need to figure out, first giving up on jailer then being "demoralised" this tier.
[4:07:25] EllisTheMenace1: echo was behind around 5 hours after the restarts and still killed it 4 hours before limit theyt didnt get shit handed to them
[4:07:33] Sollice: @DeathWarrant21 Thats part of the game my dude
[4:07:39] Wikedlyrics: man there is some hardcore fanboy chatting going on right now
[4:07:44] Gingerprimer: NGL the only thing I blame this race is I Blizzard for not being able to creat a good encounter that does not need htofixes
[4:07:46] manmower: sometimes life throws you a free win, it all averages out
[4:07:50] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols lolol you called me a cunt for no reason, stop acting like a child
[4:07:53] DoughBoi_Trev: OK all the echo fan boys in chat going to attack, down boys... someone put these kids back in their kennels
[4:07:56] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:08:05] Bulgogiprince: Granted the obvious gap at the top means they can take the time to get second because no one else is close to them.
[4:08:10] ThePawPaw: towComfy
[4:08:19] TonyNineNugz: i like how there people legit fighting in chat lmao

[4:08:27] g0n_z3n: Man people need to go touch some grass LOL
[4:08:28] Jarlan23: xbox is better than playstation anyone wanna fight about it
[4:08:34] Funderik: @Gingerprimer point us in the direction of a game that has never been hotfixes please.
[4:08:35] Exxcar: @ThePawPaw I agree we all need towComfy
[4:08:36] Niksen_99: People still mad Liquid lost again? KEKW

[4:08:39] emznev: hey chat let's move on ye ? Nice Jebasted Jebasted Jebasted
[4:08:41] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols biggest sore loser in this chat, valiantly defending a guild that are clearly second best, you are just sad
[4:08:41] Rudric_Ice: guys guys Echo is just too good u cant beat em just like Tom Brady
[4:08:43] ClubsSC: @Gingerprimer Hey AMEN bud. This is the real take.
[4:08:44] Sollice:  Also, dont be silly with the Echo vs Limit conversations folks. You can have a good debate, but personal attacks are going to get TOd. You have been warned
[4:08:47] ThisIzD: @Sollice RIPBOZO
[4:08:47] Ultratide_: this is great KEKW nymnCorn
[4:08:50] Valzark: @DoughBoi_Trev echo 1 shot it after the nerfs liquid wiped for 4 hours after nerfs u do the math
[4:08:50] xhaven: @Funderik yea I agree with you there hope Liquid can overcome this, maybe the team needs to do some legit motivational/mental activities I dont know
[4:08:55] trione288: CHAT THIS WEEK IS DUNGEOIN WEEK, GET YOUR HEROIC RAID LOOT

[4:09:32] DoughBoi_Trev: @letrickyxd LUL LUL LUL LUL bro I watched the whole race I seen what nerfs came in when and the most substantial nerf came when echo was awake
[4:09:36] Rictamar: @Wikedlyrics look at this chat, how can you not think that is Liquid fans?? LUL
[4:09:36] Whiskey_Corin: Echo was handed the win on a silver platter. Sham race
