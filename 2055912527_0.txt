[1:46:13] NCCaretto: never ending bot war
[1:46:14] marius402: why are ppl stacking supply crates right now does anyone know? other than rep do they give xp?
[1:46:18] frederikv225: look this addon spy holy
[1:46:19] Blackhaxx: blizz need to get those bots  out
[1:46:23] espi: On HC there's always 5-15 level 45 bots in Scholomance. I've been reporting them since Jan 1st.
[1:46:25] butlerlog: i get in game mail every day for a bot getting banned from my reports
[1:46:26] BabaChaw: ye I always get mail after someone gets banned xd
[1:46:27] Ktmil: create a bot to report bot :D
[1:46:29] hutchyy917: @lolartsection it was him right? zeroji?
[1:46:29] someteej: i killed a group of bots yesterday.. dude was pissed and whispered me
[1:46:31] PaladinIRL: the clone wars have taken a toll on society
[1:46:32] YzieGG: KEKW
[1:46:34] realandtruephobe: Lol im always afraid of looking like a bot on my hunter
[1:46:35] handy_grenade: "guess theres 1 day before p2, guess i wont run my bot today"
[1:46:35] bigballerbob92: they'll pass the check, right?
[1:46:36] bigwilly3737: yeah thats the guy who solo farmed lbrs with his hunter hes insane
[1:46:37] athalon: i love getting the mail saying they took action on an account JUSTICEE
[1:46:37] jargly: he didnt report the lvl 24 lol
[1:46:38] asloff: alright, i skimmed through that arthas vid and i take it back. it's a pretty good summary
[1:46:49] pmanfit91: @Xaryu  - Thoughts on P1 supply shipments not giving experience for level 25 and up / Giving that information out a couple days prior to launch?
[1:46:49] paraizord: Do you know when Hardcore SF will go out?
[1:46:52] BitLegions: can i join ur group lol
[1:46:53] justjones37: some botters are backed up by big investors they don't give a damn
[1:46:59] ogSaltdaddy: Then it would be very easy to get unbanned anyways
[1:47:01] tonyvitek: we should make a bot that report bots
[1:47:02] limburgse: omg look how many! :O
[1:47:03] lolartsection: @hutchyy917 first time hearing it lol
[1:47:06] willywep: that last one wasnt a bot xD
[1:47:07] shalomski: The vid who's the tank was and old but gold wow vid
[1:47:09] TMMOOF: give people a report quote and free wow time. I bet people would do that all the time
[1:47:12] gdkpgold: just ban the whole class
[1:47:31] tw1ZTER: imagine you get 1 gold per report succesful
[1:47:33] tw1ZTER: peepoGiggles
[1:47:34] TheWhiteRabbitxX: If anything, the price for everything else is gonna go up so people will still buy gold. It’s just people won’t buy as much gold and hopefully reduce them overtime.
[1:47:35] paraizord: SF HARDCORE, when coming out?
[1:47:38] BabaChaw: permanently enabled would mean some lvl 60 rogue camping wetlands 24/7
[1:47:39] BitLegions: i would  just keep hiring people to ban them
[1:47:42] surfhax: Yo, is BFD reseting again tomorrow??
[1:47:54] MumblezWithaZ: @paraizord eww
[1:48:01] BabaChaw: @surfhax well. Tomorrow is season 2 start xd
[1:48:07] plae007: @surfhax havent heard anything about adding a reset for launch so i'd hold out on running it
[1:48:07] gdkpgold: @tw1ZTER bots banning bots , infinite money print
[1:48:08] BitLegions: every bot you ban you get 5$
[1:48:13] frederikv225: sick
[1:48:19] ElephantSurfer: @BabaChaw no its not resetting again, why would it
[1:48:21] bigblinky69: group?
[1:48:22] iRayG2: can’t wait
[1:48:27] heygoditsme: niceee
[1:48:28] delicioustoast4: but you can group?
[1:48:30] surfhax: @plae007 I know, so is it reseting or not? lol
[1:48:31] lolartsection: Ssf is out?
[1:48:32] plae007: @BabaChaw doesnt mean anything, most likely wont reset since reset is today
[1:48:33] pilot_wk: runescape style ironman, very nice
[1:48:38] slapshotsd: @delicioustoast4 yes
[1:48:38] bluptual: just like runescapes iron man mode
[1:48:39] TheWhiteRabbitxX: sweet
[1:48:43] espi: SF*
[1:48:43] RudyRube: @lolartsection PTR
[1:48:43] Mahca_: it’s never been ssf, always said sf so yes you can group
[1:48:46] realandtruephobe: I hope you can't opt back in at that same character
[1:48:46] TheWhiteRabbitxX: that’s dope for real
[1:48:54] surfhax: @ElephantSurfer I dont know, classicraidreset link is showing a reset tomorrow for some reason
[1:49:00] bluptual: yeh its a nice balance
[1:49:00] sleepyhxllow: was is that for?
[1:49:02] lolartsection: Xar get on ssf!
[1:49:03] plae007: @surfhax if you couldnt tell, no one knows.  so dont run it hoping it would. lol
[1:49:04] ScryerTV: IM RLY EXCITED FOR SF >3
[1:49:09] swaeex: they're thinking of ssf in poe
[1:49:09] heygoditsme: @sleepyhxllow solo self found
[1:49:12] xprobutterrz: perfect balance.  I prefer SF over SSF
[1:49:17] bluptual: totally ripped from osrs but i love it
[1:49:18] BabaChaw: oh but it is only for hardcore?
[1:49:18] 3shotBR: do you lose the icon if you break the rules?
[1:49:18] berserage95: why can u group? thats literally just hc?
[1:49:18] gdkpgold: ssf NODDERS
[1:49:20] ScryerTV: niiiice
[1:49:20] demonzhunter: that is cool
[1:49:21] limburgse: nais
[1:49:27] paraizord: WHEN
[1:49:27] pilot_wk: this is so sick!
[1:49:28] lolartsection: I miss Shannon HC
[1:49:31] wreckstormx: wooow
[1:49:33] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I love this so much
[1:49:34] Polardave: so no more engi + consumes
[1:49:35] sleepyhxllow: @heygoditsme what does it do tho?
[1:49:39] bigsugg: no runes?!?!
[1:49:39] Tropicocity: Xaryuuu
[1:49:40] bluptual: thank god they took from runescape
[1:49:45] gdkpgold: @lolartsection rip shannon
[1:49:48] Mahca_: glad you can group for named quests now, waiting just sucked
[1:49:52] demonzhunter: can you take the buff off?
[1:49:55] heygoditsme: @sleepyhxllow u cant trade, use mail or ah
[1:49:57] xprobutterrz: i'm coming back to wow for this
[1:49:59] bigblinky69: but can you group with non sf?
[1:49:59] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: i feel like this will be a damn near impossible thing with a limit of 2 professions?
[1:50:09] bluptual: full sf groups gonna be joining eachother solely
[1:50:10] zx10rx: so basically get friends to run you through dungeons. What a waste lol
[1:50:12] BabaChaw: ye makes sense. grouping is fine. The most players who chose SF mode anyway do it for the challenge and not the reputation by getting boosted
[1:50:13] BitLegions: this server prob stop bots
[1:50:13] DeathToad007: you can drop and add new ones after u get what u need
[1:50:15] 3shotBR: they just imported the HC addon
[1:50:16] sleepyhxllow: why would someone ever need this?
[1:50:16] berserage95: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany u think getting to 60 is impossible?
[1:50:20] slapshotsd: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany what do you mean? this is how people were playing hardcore last summer
[1:50:21] heygoditsme: @sleepyhxllow but u can group so this is just SF self found
[1:50:29] iRayG2: W
[1:50:36] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany no, but there will be certain things that are literally impossible to get with only 2 professions
[1:50:37] gdkpgold: wow soo new much wow
[1:50:38] politimi_72: next for wow, Hardcore server with NO leveling allowed! You need to raid as 1 lvl character @Xaryu
[1:50:39] Elvandel: Can I right clock off the buff lol
[1:50:44] slapshotsd: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany so?
[1:50:46] ernesstoo_: shit
[1:50:47] demonzhunter: i think its a good solution
[1:50:49] BitLegions: abandon ship
[1:50:49] demonzhunter: approach
[1:50:53] djdrizza: djdrizza subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! pog
[1:50:55] realandtruephobe: Yeah, id prefer a Self found dedicated server for sure
[1:50:57] butlerlog: I don't think it needs its own server, the buff is enough
[1:50:57] bluptual: for sir
[1:50:58] Monday__Tv: So self found will be a real thing?
[1:50:59] parmejohn__: you should be able to group its an mmo
[1:51:01] berserage95: so ssf can group for raids with nomrmal people?  can blizzard do anything right? holy
[1:51:03] ScryerTV: same server is cool tbh
[1:51:09] Mahca_: it doesn’t need its own server
[1:51:10] julienb95: It's an MMO they should be able to group
[1:51:10] luckdog55: Wish I waited on my HC Paladin for SSF. Paladins aren't as gear dependent as warriors
[1:51:14] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany so, come raiding, why would anyone take an SF character if they will be limited on consumes?
[1:51:14] lolartsection: @heygoditsme this username and sub LOL timing
[1:51:16] slapshotsd: def the most evergreen option
[1:51:16] bluptual: sf hc is bringing me back to hc servers @Xaryu
[1:51:23] demonzhunter: yeah
[1:51:28] delicioustoast4: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany they cleared naxx with rules more strict than this, it will be fine
[1:51:28] BabaChaw: I wonder if you can send mail between characters
[1:51:28] espi: did they say anything about professions @Xaryu ?
[1:51:34] Tropicocity: They also delayed Cata beta lol
[1:51:35] slapshotsd: @TwitchIsAHorribleCompany SF is about leveling, there's no reason to raid self found unless you're in a self found guild
[1:51:35] zx10rx: dude this is useless. you can literally group with people that are not SF. what a waste of
[1:51:36] BabaChaw: your own ofc
[1:51:38] butlerlog: they've been pretty smart about the release timings
[1:51:38] ruperttheyeti: same
[1:51:39] BitLegions: s o d hype
[1:51:39] sleepyhxllow: why would someone need to do this? @heygoditsme
[1:51:40] demonzhunter: its long term
[1:51:47] Almighty_kenzo: What’s your guys thought on Sprite the beverage?
[1:51:49] IlvarsK: so you can't send mail to your own characters?
[1:51:49] bluptual: would you consider adding your live chat to your youtube videos? i really miss the reactions of chat when im watching
[1:51:51] oompous: you think the servers are gonna be complete shit tomorrow at launch? think we're just gonna sit in queue lol
[1:51:51] paraizord: Jesus, SF Hardcore is so much better then SOD
[1:51:52] Mahca_: Cata beta delayed so it’ll probably be in a month for sf
[1:51:59] realandtruephobe: @zx10rx Yeah I agree if you can group with non self found players it's kind of lame
[1:52:01] TheWhiteRabbitxX: This is the only mode that makes it feel for me like the original game
[1:52:04] BitLegions: yes
[1:52:11] Mahca_: good
[1:52:13] harrisbueller: sprite is A tier soda
[1:52:13] LifeOfSponge: good
[1:52:14] ShutrMcGavin: idk if blizzard wants to plan patches and releases around streamers though.
[1:52:14] Crewcial: @Xaryu you see my dono msg? :o it didnt pop lol
[1:52:15] bluptual: @paraizord agreed, but i think they both hit the dopamine centers
[1:52:22] LifeOfSponge: hc is dead right now, doesnt need another split
[1:52:22] berserage95: blizzard is so shit lmao, they get praised but cant even do ssf without grouping with normal people LUL
[1:52:27] inspect4: U still excited to do the same quests and zones for like 6th time on hardcore?
[1:52:31] iKUDDA: Xy I know your not on Enshrouded right now but how do you feel about the game?
[1:52:40] BabaChaw: @inspect4 a lot of people just like classic
[1:52:48] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @lifeofsponge hard-core is dead because it was never really hard-core. You could get twined anybody could that’s lame af
[1:52:51] bigballerbob92: you're a niche
[1:52:51] slapshotsd: @inspect4 only the 6th time?
[1:52:54] Goobadoobadoob: If it's sf what's the economy
[1:52:54] bluptual: @berserage95 SF toons will be playing with other SF toons for dungeons/.raids 100%
[1:52:54] annihillape: you could just choose to only group up with other sf characters
[1:52:58] Kushiize: lolo
[1:52:59] ScryerTV: so cuz its a nitche we cant get what we want? how is that an argument xd
[1:52:59] Mahca_: @berserage95 they don’t need to… just don’t group if you don’t like it
[1:53:03] Zerksyera: you're a Niche
[1:53:04] berserage95: "its a niche" is that supposed to be an argument for something not being implemented the way people wanted? LUL wtf
[1:53:06] BitLegions: lol
[1:53:07] demonzhunter: how many people actually play it?
[1:53:14] af10101: Life is a niche @Xaryu
[1:53:18] inspect4: @slapshotsd on hc yeah
[1:53:22] realandtruephobe: @Erwiney That's true, but many won't, and so it will kind of remove the shine of leveling to 60 on HC SF
[1:53:25] evazer0x: say niche some more
[1:53:27] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I’m in
[1:53:28] Boneyards_666: pogg
[1:53:28] BingoBangoLive: shoulda just made it unable to group w/ non-SF
[1:53:31] Gashunk1: we making a niche guild?
[1:53:34] Gashunk1: finally
[1:53:35] bluptual: @berserage95 it means they wont waste money developing sometrhing that minority want
[1:53:37] prfssrzaddy: I love that you say niche instead of niche
[1:53:41] shmanglez: Mitch Jones got niched
[1:53:42] undeadtroll30: also no bots on only ssf server
[1:53:43] crazbrelbeck: guild name nicheofaniche
[1:53:44] Veranus: love this idea
[1:53:45] slapshotsd: @inspect4 xar's gone through 6 warriors on hardcore, let alone other classes
[1:53:49] BingoBangoLive: Can you even trade at max level?
[1:53:50] Valencia_Pete: why would i  care if there is other people playing if i am ssf
[1:53:53] stooke: @Xaryu sod timer ?
[1:53:54] the_dayquill: is trading going to open up at lvl 60?
[1:53:55] oompous: @af10101 invalid argument. a dedi server for ssf costs blizzard money. the niche of life isnt costing you until you get down to cost of living etc

[1:54:04] realandtruephobe: @undeadtroll30 This is the biggest thing to me.
[1:54:09] BabaChaw: @BingoBangoLive they thought about it but makes it shit for long term play since there arent many players who like SF mode
[1:54:12] BitLegions: s o d hype
[1:54:16] TheWhiteRabbitxX: The only reason you would care if other people are not SSF is because your group run is tainted. If you’re in a group full of people that are twin does that make sense?
[1:54:16] plae007: @Xaryu  True warrior HC on SF?
[1:54:21] Dimpleshift: @Xaryu Cables or Dumbells for arm workouts
[1:54:25] inspect4: @slapshotsd i didnt count chars who died at 20 or 30

[2:02:00] slapshotsd: @Chronollo for sure, but the archetypal nature of his character makes him feel colossal in some ways and utterly unoriginal in others, he's great for pulling new fans to warcraft universe tho

[2:49:01] GoshiTheBroshi: @Xaryu any Dungeonborn today? game is goated
[2:49:14] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu You need high mana for surge to be good

[2:49:24] BitLegions: loool
[2:49:28] stuttersx: used all your mana tf
[2:49:30] Sgt_TBag: KEKW

[2:49:40] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu You need high mana for it to do high damage
[2:49:40] Himm4: you have to be full mana

[2:49:46] Heln0k: more mana more damage
[2:49:48] Himm4: and it one shot
[2:49:49] L0cooo: @Mahca_ yea i know but why not i mean to say
[2:49:50] vejitas4: @xaryu you brother you will most likely die to us rogues now our meta now is mutilate , but haven't really tested on a good mage
[2:49:54] RjCrit: Did you have regen on
[2:49:54] Systam11: does blast increase its dmg?

[2:50:04] Jayceza: icey veins
[2:50:07] demonzhunter: using it at full mana

[2:50:10] pandemanium_tv: u were 50% mana bro
[2:50:12] BitLegions: does Arcane blast x the heal
[2:50:12] demonzhunter: that isnt a good strategy

[2:50:32] Himm4: arcane blast stacks then arcane surge
[2:50:34] ShinyMatrex: @adam90k have you seen how hard they hit for atm?
[2:50:39] BigChoobs: next phase with spellfrost, maybe icy veins is good for faster casts instead of instant spell dmg
[2:50:40] Mahca_: @l0cooo like why not get to the first lockout? sorry got a bit confused. but he also doesn’t play on weekends
[2:50:40] g_1_t: @Reinert7284 crusader strike

[2:59:30] paladan_tich: @Jubilation12 you must not being playing all the content because its a great xpac
[2:59:30] Exusprime: modCheck looking for the 2 zoomers who play wow
[2:59:32] Nectis_: classic feels like a better starting point because its much slower paced so you will develop your own interests and understanding in the game so you wont get bored
[2:59:33] davisjones_: thats actually not true at all
[2:59:34] xDeathzDezignx: I have been playing since vanilla and I love retail period
[2:59:35] davisjones_: like at ALL
[2:59:35] Ama_ryilis: my retail guild is dead, has been for years. classic is still going strong

[2:59:48] DeathToad007: look at his gear
[2:59:48] PocketLotion: fact is retail is trasg
[2:59:48] DWhite990: Retail is just pay for boost to 70 and get raid tier gear and never have played before
[2:59:49] PendeJoe: Xar becomes dad, immediately switches to classic andy
[2:59:49] GOSUBO_: retail has no community
[2:59:50] Fl1ntBeastw00d: true, ppl dont even communicate at all during raids and stuff
[2:59:51] WallysWorld_: Classic = casual. Retail = Competitive
[2:59:51] davisjones_: Everything
[2:59:52] frnkdndy: And blizzard shafted hunters SO bad by giving all other classes insane PvP runes...
[2:59:52] gambleragain: Damn on point.

[3:00:00] Jubilation12: @Jubilation12 yea a pretty opoular oopinion lol
[3:00:01] yowler_: i wish I wouldnt need 2 accounts to play alliance and horde in sod Cryge
[3:00:04] bocothe1st: people just say anything
[3:00:04] MicroChaotic: I love arena, but i also love this new classic wow
[3:00:07] davisjones_: They've added a shit ton of side quest / lore driven stuff
[3:00:08] fetza108: i did loremaster in retail some days ago and i played half year. i went back to sod
[3:00:10] my_keii: he prob think classic takes skill lol
[3:00:11] DrJKLHyde: ban that guy
[3:00:12] Rarecandy317: "That's not true at all." - guy who disagrees with everything so he feels original
[3:00:14] fjayve: classic wow is for community 100% . retail are for super sweats and competitive gameplay
[3:00:15] Hickspaced3: i would disagree with the theory crafting point. these days classic is just as much min maxxing
[3:00:16] DLCherenkov: ashenvale music ♥ Listening
[3:00:16] bingooskhan: u dont need to be competitive to play classic
[3:00:17] grizz430: I agree with you Xaryu but thats opinion not fact
[3:00:18] yukmouf_: why make a choice play both
[3:00:23] asloff: You made retail into a lobby game. there is a community feel on retail still. just not on pvp servers like tich
[3:00:24] wahedje: Got a tip for rogue versus mage duels?
[3:00:25] fetza108: i play both
[3:00:26] Vandracon: just a boomer that wants to be sweaty

[3:00:33] GreenLizzardx: anyone tryed the lunar festival boss yet ?
[3:00:37] twotonehs: rogue should vanish LF right?
[3:00:38] rns_aurelius: classic is easier to get into and easier to return to after a break
[3:00:40] ezentricks: parsing in classic is so weird lol, why tf do ppl do it
[3:00:42] rfourt: @grizz430 xar says it, it's FACTS
[3:00:47] andTHISiswhat: Retail is more fixed around being able to play game solo... Classic is fixed around needing ppl to complete stuff in game
[3:00:47] Warryour: Retail = 50 weakauras
[3:00:48] gambleragain: Anyone who shits on retail is either just bad at the game and can't access all the content, or just hasn't played it at all and can't make an opinion for themselves. @Xaryu
[3:00:49] Django_7: a half trained monkey pressing random buttons on a keyboard can parse in a classic raid, content is trivial @Xaryu
[3:00:49] twitchdjtacoma: HolidayPresent from AMZN NYSE
[3:00:49] BlueZense: classic can be sweaty but in a different way than retail
[3:01:05] L0cooo: mage pvp feels unfair all the time
[3:01:13] Slabzzzzzzzz: have you fought the new mutilate rogues yet?
[3:01:15] UncleCalus: Classic and retail have wayyy too many players for either to be called "dead"
[3:01:20] butlerlog: yeah the people that think they are hot shit in classic would hate the idea that it is the easy game. its more enjoyable to me, but it is definitely easier than retail prog.
[3:01:21] Slabzzzzzzzz: its fucking broken
[3:01:24] fjayve: in retail, for end game, you're just waiting for some queue to pop lol. raiding or pvp. classic is just exploration. never seen so much open world activity since classic came back
[3:01:27] pizac7: retail = whack a mole at the arcade. classic = bingo at the retirement home
[3:01:31] twitchdjtacoma: Who know?
[3:01:32] christiangodwarrior97: people parse in classic wow because the content is trivial. its there to give them a reason to min max and make it a bit more interesting
[3:01:33] inoxkoma: retail is not that bad its just you dont have any comm its like you play with npc´s
[3:01:34] 5thD5thD: @Xaryu how giga OP do you think shadow priests will be?
[3:01:34] crumbler81: kinda wish they would put a classic mode in retail...imagine experiencing the new story with classic gameplay Pog
[3:01:37] Dobronx8: Damn ggs
[3:01:38] ii_poncho_via_ii: does no one run imp sprint lmao
[3:01:43] berserage95: @fjayve i love people like you who think end game in retail is lfr and dungeons that can be queued, so stupid LUL
[3:01:45] twitchdjtacoma: who know everything
[3:01:46] demonzhunter: it sucks
[3:01:51] crymyz: retail is lfg simulator in PVP and PVE
[3:02:03] gambleragain: I play retail, wrath, and classic and I enjoy all 3 for different reasons @Xaryu
[3:02:03] butlerlog: its an esport rather than an RPG
[3:02:04] DeathToad007: abilites dont do anything
[3:02:05] twitchdjtacoma: he is never ever played he and she will never ever play this
[3:02:11] asloff: i would challenge you to make a new toon on a retail rp realm
[3:02:11] ipntheshower: My hand hurts after playing that shit
[3:02:12] TiqerWoW: youre not allowed to miss a gcd pretty much
[3:02:13] Jubilation12: YEP
[3:02:13] ppommyy: you should use rewind time
[3:02:14] DeathToad007: itsa useless
[3:02:26] mostlikelyyadad: @xaryu when phase 2 goes live are you gonna play regular sod character or hc sod character first?
[3:02:30] mrpubrehab: zar- I came from Osrs and gta, never really played put 5mnths into 2 toons and learn the game abit got full season3 pvp conquest get it was fun the pvp was cool watching flying number, 2mnths on classic sod so far watched Mitch and went with the warrior class w. no one to hold my hand found out warrior 1-18 was really touch, switched to a Druid and found range much better and is nice to be in feral, & tryed to level an ele shaman but feels like it’s a little flat vs retail shaman
[3:02:32] twitchdjtacoma: GalaxyUnpacked
[3:02:32] mussletets420: classic = less wear on the keyboard
[3:02:32] TheoDeri: u press 100 buttons and then  u get random one shot for no reason
[3:02:34] OloCdn: retail ttk for most classes is under 5 seconds.
[3:02:34] grizzlyhead: what about ret pala that one shot ppl in retail? KEKW
[3:02:35] Biohazzard567: retail nobody knows what the fuck is going on
[3:02:36] Jubilation12: so dogshit
[3:02:36] kebablangaren: i like classic because ever zone is filled with players. If i wanted to quest in retail i would see 1 person per zone
[3:02:37] Bolt_: xarNerdge
[3:02:39] kraugan: why frost talents , not arcane for lvling?
[3:02:47] DWhite990: Retail has taken away the feeling of getting a crit because everything crits all the time
[3:02:54] Nju___: @TheoDeri true
[3:02:54] P_h_l_o_x: have you played ESO?
[3:02:57] santii1207: ive been saying, the game doesnt need 20 buttons, u can have 4-5 (like league), being meaningful. theres still a lot of combinations to be made with that ammount of spells specialyl when u combine 3 people
[3:03:02] Awks_TV: @Xaryu Im playing regen / rewind time / living flame, can you try this rune comp, I think its better
[3:03:04] cocoyummm: bars
[3:03:04] a6msai: rap god
[3:03:04] Warryour: DinoDance
[3:03:04] HellaKopta: so much bloat over a long time
[3:03:06] Xzanelol: @kraugan is he lvling?
[3:03:07] g0dzilla: me as a new wow player, retail doesnt look interesting at all... it looks shit, and there are to many addons... i wouldnt even know where to start and dont know if i can catch up with all the progamer in there
[3:03:07] ACRocker: damn thats crazy
[3:03:08] crumbler81: catJAM
[3:03:08] daigurren2: lolk
[3:03:08] GOSUBO_: ele sham in classic. KEKW
[3:03:08] OloCdn: that was a lot
[3:03:09] grizzlyhead: TriKool
[3:03:10] NareeM: in RTL they can delete all abilities but def/off cds and all would be the same
[3:03:10] Rawrch: ??????????????
[3:03:11] kekailani_: True it just doesn’t feel like buttons have a huge impact on pvp targets
[3:03:12] booker105: that mustve been what mitch said to miz
[3:03:13] berserage95: @santii1207 absolutely 100% disagree an mmo needs more than 5 buttons lmao
[3:03:14] gary_ontwitch: KEKW dear diary,

[3:03:19] twitchdjtacoma: GalaxyUnpacked
[3:03:20] Bolt_: Hey @Xaryu how's mage feeling after the pre-phase 2 patch?
[3:03:24] SillyPanda: new pasta dropped
[3:03:24] BlueZense: ele shaman gonna fuck ppl up next phase
[3:03:27] OllyWombat: @Xaryu is there a certain time that p2 goes live?
[3:03:28] DeathWing141: @Xaryu have you played elder scrolls online ?
[3:03:28] ppommyy: go back to orsrs
[3:03:30] n_hyun_s: giving up living bomb?
[3:03:31] ppommyy: rewind time is bis
[3:03:34] Xrantin: @xaryu are you hyped for hunters in p2?
[3:03:37] fetza108: what i dont like in retail the overwhelming visual effecta and too fast combat animations...
[3:03:41] RudyRube: @mrpubrehab ele shaman is flat because you dont have chain lightning or 5pts into the 1 second cooldown reduc yet
[3:03:42] mrpubrehab: classic is much funnier game play more in the world like you said and retail felt like rush to 70 and get best gear to fight people
[3:03:53] ppommyy: rewind time cd is nice
[3:03:59] asloff: @Xrantin traplauncher is a game changer
[3:04:01] SgtPepperTTV: bursty = rewind time, also when we get iceblock rewind gets better
[3:04:03] Warryour: Loot is terrible in retail, too
[3:04:08] Koeyyyy: Is the xar gonna cast or compete in the sod dueling tourney?
[3:04:08] twitchdjtacoma: i want find job
[3:04:09] a6msai: I think the only thing that appeals to me in retail is mythic+

[3:04:28] Django_7: when is the tourney? @Xaryu
[3:04:29] M0rley_: I cant believe they did nothing for resto in p2 for sham. Still going to be non existent
[3:04:31] GOSUBO_: @mrpubrehab classics very much boost to 60 to play the game. or youre weaiting like an hour to find groups for dungeons..
[3:04:32] santii1207: @berserage95 you must be stupid, cause new world is so much better as an open world mmo and only has 6 spells, and u can exchange them at any time
[3:04:34] twitchdjtacoma: please open
[3:04:34] jakaupr: PogChamp

[3:04:35] Vandracon: xaryu ready for it
[3:04:37] kaddahan: retail - Green Boss, casting Green Void onto green ground
[3:04:39] LoosieJuice: i last played retail on shadowlands, did the second raid then everyone i know quit. logged on a week ago, leveled up and did LFR and some 10-12 keys. the game is essentially: sit in main city, wait for queue, get into group, do content and be toxic to each other about who is the worst one in the group, repeat
[3:04:40] twitchdjtacoma: your basic salary
[3:04:41] BlueZense: think they ever do one os EU servers ?
[3:04:43] crymyz: i play retail if i just wanna que arena, classic for shits and gigs and pve
[3:04:47] Chrigss: get mitch to be a commentator
[3:04:47] OllyWombat: pshero was pouting because he wasnt invited yet @Xaryu

[3:04:52] SgtPepperTTV: Are there going to be open brackets or just invitational? I want my revenge vs Hozi from the Makgora

[3:05:16] Pritochr: Would you say the "classic/sod" Mage is a hard class to play?
[3:05:17] urudliv: ps defo wasnt pouting, whoever said that doesnt know shit
[3:05:24] santii1207: @berserage95 plus it would make pvp actually try to be an esport. with 20 spells, which most of them dont do nothinng and its just rotation, it just wont work. it hasnt i mean. its not even in the talks when people talk esports
[3:05:25] BigChoobs: we want avizura and mir!

[3:06:43] UncleCalus: @xaryu As an outside-wow player, retail sounds like its EXTREMELY artifical and without mystery, like people already know the damn raids before they are released.

[4:02:44] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[4:02:51] milkywaiz_tv: Myth: Olive oil produces carcinogens when it's heated. Fact. What's true is that when any cooking oil is heated to the point where it smokes (its smoke point) it breaks down and may produce potentially carcinogenic toxins. Different oils reach their smoke points at different temperatures.
[4:02:51] julienb95: Olive oil is high calorie though isn't it?
