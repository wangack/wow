[0:25:04] Ento__: i see
[0:25:07] bsg_wiz: like imagine it's 3000 years later, its not, but it feels it
[0:25:09] Ento__: i like sod a lot right now
[0:25:29] bsg_wiz: Ven i remember u sayin u were interested in Frost DK and jc whats the big draw of that for u?

[0:32:07] taylorperiod: @nikthevoker ah kk, was going to see if it's good. saw eu running it
[0:32:07] betasoldier: Flarkness has a good frost DK build that provides more goes. You end up resetting your main CD every 40 seconds or so instead of a minute, maybe a little under if you're lucky
[0:32:10] likeewlock: tuning comes today?
[0:32:15] baconstrippers: I'd say regardless of if you like WoW or not, you'd have to admit it is a great game objectively

[0:39:52] Infernum1207: he shouldn't use bubble insta ... he should use his shield of vengeance first
[0:39:57] soddi: i wonder why the ret doesn't do lay on hands first instead of bubble, when damp is low

[0:54:24] zachgamegodx: Tony, Shadowdeath(dk), lanat (priest guy), and kasu will be a team
[0:55:09] Stoichulk: Judgement also reduces damage people do
[0:55:11] iloveyalunn: I sometimes drop tower of radiance for short aura mastery
[0:55:12] e10100111001: it's good to take divine vision with unwavering because cd reduc on aura mastery
[0:55:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tony on boomkin was fun, but seeing him represent feral is awesome
[0:55:28] ImJordanHi: Hey El you enjoying the cooldown healers more than the HOT proactive healers?
[0:55:29] Roxxybolts: this the vengood?
[0:55:38] Varaben: yeah it goes from 3min to 1.5m
[0:55:43] Varaben: with divine vision pvp talent
[0:55:49] Varaben: and the other one in the tree
[0:55:56] Roxxybolts: I just played a little feral destro hpal with tony and pellet and my go
[0:55:57] iloveyalunn: Yea 1.5min AoE wall, kinda nice
[0:56:04] Roxxybolts: god* we destroyed everything in sight
[0:56:14] malvarcla: should do a tier list on tier listr
[0:56:14] klocksmith: how is mw/'fw?
[0:56:21] betasoldier: he was practicing pres last night
[0:56:21] baxter5569: :( when are they gonna lift conquest cap
[0:56:24] RedeemedbyJesus: What are your top 2 for fun?
[0:56:26] rekroyal: where can you see patch notes
[0:56:31] xJxlly: i really hope season 1 tier wins the vote for pres
[0:57:16] ImJordanHi: Whazz said Mehhx pretty much exclusively plays evoker (last season). Seems like he's put A LOT of time into it
[0:57:20] ImJordanHi: I bet he plays it this szn too
[0:57:27] lundbergmackan: what is what weakaura for blessing
[0:57:35] RedeemedbyJesus: Healer main!?
[0:57:41] vilecurse_01: Healing feels great right now
[0:57:44] Bourbons86: do you enjoy any of them more than you enjoy playing dps toons though?
[0:57:45] RedeemedbyJesus: AWC dps to SS healer legend
[0:57:46] ryanblue98: If you had 2 min ques on dps would you be healing
[0:57:55] baxter5569: @venruki i have mad respect for you healing this season. its so chaotic compared to last season. ppl can still die 100-0 in a single CC outside of their burst windows. its so stressful
[0:59:03] Metaphors: me, an intelligence enjoyer, knows if dps qs would pop venruki would never play healer this much
[0:59:12] e10100111001: you can reduce a lot of it if you can get a glare off
[0:59:36] soddi: "big" heals (hp bar moves 5%)
[1:00:00] e10100111001: fdk is good? :D
[1:01:25] soddi: the blind>stun>silence combo from dks is so annoying :< all instant, can only trinket one of 3
[1:03:23] deepwhat1: Venruki thank you for loving the music you love. The amount of songs i've rediscovered while watching your stream is uncountable! <3
[1:03:23] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[1:05:49] soddi: no pets for snowball to jump to is def an advantage
[1:05:53] joyrex_j9: people shit all over frost dks but 90% of the time I see them, they destroy the lobby
[1:06:17] gentlecatzz: Frost dk feels really weird to me, from an outsider's perspective at least. What survival has the spec got?
[1:06:26] knappster15: FDK is extremely matchup dependent. Imagine triple Wizard lobby on Tol'Viron
[1:06:32] ghostware9000: they just killed through sham wall
[1:06:34] ghostware9000: LOL |
[1:06:36] B0ost3d: lmaooo
[1:06:38] yesterday_potato: Solo shuffle is where its at
[1:06:48] e10100111001: ss is so chaotic
[1:07:18] gelatokush: @joyrex_j9 i agree they destroy the lobby, no one is having fun when frost dk is in the game, including the frost dk :D
[1:09:13] Symo85: evening sir
[1:10:00] notoriousztv: unholy dks damage is about 1/3 of what it should be
[1:10:28] gentlecatzz: Qotsa? Huge
[1:10:30] mrxilio: great song
[1:10:53] stealthwalker99: The melee are not playing split when frost dk has a go and it's a really good lobby for him. Pretty free 6-0
[1:10:58] Kalakbar: monkaEyes
[1:11:03] egrounds: Trapped in DFW airport due to a few snowflakes, Dallas is so dumb!
[1:11:05] engzyng: why dont you play single glimmer ?
[1:11:08] Datguyjay: gg go next
[1:11:08] Sosatko: Frost dk is so hard for hpal lol
[1:11:10] knappster15: bop immediately out of the blind
[1:11:14] Kalakbar: @egrounds oooh, what are their names?
[1:11:15] americanmoses18: frost dk puttin in werk
[1:11:18] remmixx: Did they fix the rating for healers or is it still screwed?
[1:11:19] booodissy: freedom pony everytime you get gripped my boy
[1:11:20] soddi: reroll dwarf for that juicy 10 dot + silence removal on 2nd go :D
[1:11:33] Roxxybolts: we loveeeee hpals on the frost DK
[1:11:33] Bigvuqoffdam: prebop grip probably
[1:11:38] stealthwalker99: You have to instant bubble first go or pre bm/wall/aura
[1:11:39] kusanagi_nine: dorf so good
[1:11:40] Kalakbar: @egrounds the names of the snowflakes
[1:11:45] knappster15: There was a global between blind and the stun
[1:11:46] Roxxybolts: get bubb opener run until we ascend next go
[1:11:46] egrounds: cold and air
[1:11:51] Symo85: i think you forgot tyr's this entire game
[1:11:54] rekt1370: yea you play bm on pally
[1:11:55] iloveyalunn: Instantly freedom/charge away
[1:12:01] neskox: bm for sure and big glimmer on yourself for 16% dam reduc
[1:12:02] Bronloch: can you paste talents plz?
[1:12:04] joyrex_j9: dwarf is definitely blessed for getting out of the strang
[1:12:12] vilecurse_01: I'm out running today in this weather 🥶
[1:12:15] iloveyalunn: Thats what born told me
[1:12:19] NiikNakkx: just bubble instantly put up the season you had and just use daybreak toll
[1:12:22] ArdellanDH: Reaction time for blinding light
[1:12:27] NiikNakkx: should be fine
[1:12:34] NiikNakkx: the next go you have to instantly trinket
[1:12:37] booodissy: you have to trinket the open (stun) not the blind obviously.. then freedom pony
[1:12:39] NiikNakkx: bop
[1:12:43] knappster15: There was a global between blind and the stun. Bop instantly
[1:12:46] Birthdayy: healer rating is still screwed
[1:12:48] knappster15: Bop stops a lot of damage
[1:12:57] tarth_100: he can be double stranged through bop
[1:13:04] rekt1370: if you dont got bubble thats all you got
[1:13:06] stealthwalker99: absterge would pre aura mastery/bm/wall when I played vs him with frost. But instant bubble if you mess up use nothing else
[1:13:07] iloveyalunn: BoP is super risky to use
[1:13:13] NiikNakkx: should give you enough time to freedom steed
[1:13:15] knappster15: On the 2nd go, you alreay used bubble
[1:13:21] lilskeets: is obliterate not physical any more?
[1:13:40] fugginhiding: @lilskeets it's frost dmg with km proc
[1:13:41] style5z: not during pillar
[1:13:51] knappster15: Bubble was on cd when you died tho. and Hpally has amazing dispel protection
[1:13:53] lilskeets: @fugginhiding gotcha, thanks
[1:13:59] mrxilio: @venruki did you ever play magic the gathering or any other card games?
[1:14:00] NiikNakkx: killing machine always makes obliterate frost damage
[1:14:29] stealthwalker99: Sham purge bop is death also frost dk goes over bop
[1:14:29] nikthevoker: Hpal has bugged aura purge protection right?
[1:14:33] NiikNakkx: you could use aura mastery with concentration aura
[1:14:33] zachgamegodx: this is why all the holy palas run dwarf on na
[1:14:36] zachgamegodx: all those nasty dks
[1:14:46] NiikNakkx: that’s the scary part is the silence since hpal has no passive healing
[1:15:04] zachgamegodx: stealthwalker is big dam isnt it
[1:15:19] lundbergmackan: I would like a weakaura for infusion of light
[1:15:22] e10100111001: I try to get to a pillar immediately so it's hard to dk to get good grip go.
[1:15:27] Birthdayy: as a healer you kind of have to rely on your dps a lot as well. One game the dk counter blinded the other dks grip on healer.
[1:15:38] mrxilio: dont even need to load up spotify.. just tune into a Venruki stream
[1:15:40] Birthdayy: cant expect shuffle dps to open their eyes though
[1:15:48] rekt1370: dark iron pally seems op
[1:16:03] e10100111001: ohh yeah dwarf the strang... is nutty
[1:16:04] zachgamegodx: dwarf paladins are so righteous
[1:16:04] Kalakbar: dark iron is good, reg dwarf is nice too because you get 2% better crits
[1:16:05] rekt1370: dark iron the silence and you get massive main stat
[1:16:10] iloveyalunn: Can dark iron off the strangulate
[1:16:20] lilskeets: you got a gnome warrior but dwarf is too ugly? lol
[1:16:25] rekt1370: seen unholy grab it too
[1:16:42] truelopapi: got any pointers for someone who is nervous about starting to pvp heal?
[1:16:45] ifreed33: Wow fk U venruki dwarf hater
[1:16:46] lilskeets: animations could be better, but epic beards
[1:16:47] joyrex_j9: blasmpehy
[1:16:51] kusanagi_nine: the male dwarfs are ugly but the female dark iron look like mini Furiosa if you choose the right features
[1:16:52] gelatokush: melee animation arent bad on dwarfs tho
[1:16:55] Bronloch: yea dwarf runs like its diaper is full LUL
[1:16:57] Kalakbar: @truelopapi don't start with solo shuffle
[1:16:57] kusanagi_nine: make dorfs look like mr potato head
[1:16:59] gelatokush: they do a nice spin
[1:17:01] Kalakbar: that's so silly LOL
[1:17:01] kusanagi_nine: male*
[1:17:02] rekt1370: yea i dont get it
[1:17:18] ZealotryTV: what? they are doing another allied race?
[1:17:24] PunishedLrnz: I really want the new gnolls as allied race they look so cool lol
[1:17:27] Bigvuqoffdam: 2v2 oclock :eyes:
[1:17:30] lilskeets: 2s is a lot better to learn awareness i feel like
[1:17:32] Rocketglx: REALLY UNFUN
[1:17:36] rekt1370: so many other races can be put in the game and they do another dwarf
[1:17:41] Rocketglx: but I am getting there haha
[1:17:47] dawsonator171: I actually hate melee idiots while healing shuffle. too many just run full deep and constant los.
[1:17:48] Rocketglx: no friends to play 2s
[1:17:48] e10100111001: prepare to be kicked
[1:17:56] gelatokush: let me be a gnome dh the we can talk about adding other races
[1:17:58] iloveyalunn: good luck casting lol
[1:18:05] muhlum24: dorf is bis man what u on about
[1:18:14] muhlum24: spose yall wanted more elves LUL
[1:18:17] turbonerd1185: I just want to be a gnome paladin
[1:18:20] fugginhiding: premies
[1:18:23] lilskeets: hes too powerful!
[1:18:27] Infidel_Tech: PRECOG MAN!!!! YOOOO
[1:18:30] kusanagi_nine: lmao precogenjoyer
[1:18:34] zachgamegodx: wat if he meant awc casting
[1:18:35] xJxlly: cogged up on a monday???
[1:18:37] kusanagi_nine: gonna see if that's available on my server
[1:18:42] Symo85: good luck casting
[1:19:29] robfrmamzn: i rop alone i rop alone
[1:19:31] soddi: tyr ran out because of cc, thats why i like the initial 8s holy light :D
[1:20:06] Bigvuqoffdam: prebop the bomb DEAD
[1:20:13] iloveyalunn: pre-bop the bomb still lose lol
[1:20:19] Bigvuqoffdam: GEE GEE
[1:20:19] robfrmamzn: KEKL
[1:20:20] lilskeets: just sub rogue things
[1:20:28] PunishedLrnz: Was such a good bop too
[1:20:31] e10100111001: gotta pre the pre
[1:20:33] Kalakbar: yeah triple shaman pepeLaugh this is going to be fun
[1:20:46] rekt1370: 3 shamans GG BOPS KEKW
[1:20:54] robfrmamzn: aaaaand its gone
[1:20:54] bignoooodle: @soddi is it ok just to max our tyrs to 40 sec instantly behind pillar?
[1:21:29] e10100111001: @soddi i do same
[1:22:16] Lurkin_Park: WAYTOODANK totems
[1:22:36] huntsman302: howdy!!
[1:22:47] iloveyalunn: Suprised RMpally isnt more popular, giving even more CDR to your rogue sounds OP af
[1:23:05] malvarcla: is it just me or has solo shuffle just been dreadful this week, I lost so much cr on both toons lmao
[1:23:06] vmewo: @iloveyalunn you already have a deadly go every stun dr so doesnt really matter
[1:23:13] teddy051912: Beacons
[1:23:23] vmewo: you have to trade every single stun dr haha
[1:24:06] iloveyalunn: @vmewo Needing to trade every stun DR LUL  shit is so busted
[1:24:17] e10100111001: toss up the beacons
[1:24:18] teddy051912: Make sure you use both your beacons
[1:24:27] soddi: @bignoooodle @bignoooodle only if there is nothing else to do
[1:24:33] MathematicalWolf: how’s the healer meta in shuffle?
[1:25:08] Prototypeoni: is holy pala hard in pvp?
[1:25:09] bignoooodle: isnt the meta single glimmer now
[1:25:39] potionsmaster: do you ever play dps anymore? feel like 90 percent of the time youre healing.... blizzard needs to buff mage for you ??
[1:26:05] robfrmamzn: im useless but not for long my freedom is coming up is coming up
[1:26:06] suspicious94: I swear sub/enhc is a busted comp
[1:26:17] snosiop: its fun to watch how fast you learn new classes
[1:26:20] ferahgok: @potionsmaster it beats waiting 45 mins for a que pop
[1:26:20] Bronloch: healing is the hardest job wow
[1:26:24] soddi: ven is adicted to sub 40min. q times
[1:26:31] potionsmaster: @ferahgok ahhh i see
[1:26:57] whspe: it’s always the dragons
[1:27:08] himpnote: KICK BOT 100%
[1:28:17] stealthwalker99: If the enemy has purge, when you bop them you can also freedom the target to reduce the chance of it getting purged
[1:28:19] ganjilicious: faking both shears at once
[1:28:33] Stoichulk: lets get that 4-2!
[1:28:49] Exodizzi: Is WoW worth getting into now for pvp? Have not played since SL
[1:28:54] stalecheetos: @Exodizzi yes
[1:29:01] soddi: equip that strength weapon for extra luck
[1:29:29] robfrmamzn: i cant get to him in time, its gonna have to be you do it jesse do it
[1:30:26] lukinish: Let's go! We need to win this round
[1:30:45] lukinish: fuk
[1:30:47] ganjilicious: close call
[1:31:02] Stoichulk: coulda bubbled sooner :/ gg tho
[1:31:13] ganjilicious: @venruki getting older and finding less time to play. I usually play 2s and shuffle. Any healer that is designed to do well in both inherently?
[1:31:16] snosiop: repair
[1:31:31] robfrmamzn: RESTO DRUID
[1:31:37] lukinish: I like Disc Priest
[1:31:49] ganjilicious: been playing preserve, disc and holy pally for now
[1:31:51] dawsonator171: rdruid gonna shadowmeld the nerfs
[1:31:52] iloveyalunn: Resto druid needs a nerf
[1:31:52] Rjaxo: I like hpal
[1:31:54] anacronz: dont play prevoker
[1:31:55] Salastro: i feel holy priest empty
[1:31:56] Stoichulk: Treant needs nerfed hard
[1:31:56] ganjilicious: oh cool I'll look into that video
[1:31:57] thepk85: As long as they dont nerf rogue (which they generally don't) im good
[1:32:00] Stoichulk: like into the dumpster
[1:32:00] thepk85: we are blizzard's baby
[1:32:13] Salastro: i mean i just heal, fear on cd and thats it
[1:32:17] Bronloch: FIstweaver will be good for a while now that have hammered down the class mechanics
[1:32:19] YoMamaSoFine69: i dont want dragon to be the new rdruid
[1:32:20] lukinish: Holy priest can be very strong if well played
[1:32:26] dakila24: should i go through the insanity of trying to gear my hpal this season, i tried 1 lobby and it was 2100 from last ssn
[1:32:42] Hobblefoot: Hit the record button! I smell a video!
[1:32:59] nightmxz: WWs will rise up though too
[1:33:02] krisdahaka: then it'll be ResidentSleeper
[1:33:04] suspicious94: the pve meta is less exciting
[1:33:05] Bigvuqoffdam: sub rogue counters rdruid
[1:33:05] OMGWhatsHisFace: i wont watch a minute if it's all wizard cleaves
[1:33:09] thepk85: wait
[1:33:10] shugguls: please no C9 games , frost mage lock
[1:33:12] thepk85: there are nerfs to rogues?
[1:33:13] thepk85: where?
[1:33:17] Kalakbar: not yet
[1:33:19] mrxilio: MLD would be a thing
[1:33:19] Devcomz: They probably wont nerf outlaw so it will probably go from sub to outlaw and remain the same
[1:33:19] himpnote: i want them to nerf DH's to the ground
[1:33:19] robfrmamzn: aren't rogues not as effective in shuffies b/c no comms to set up goes?
[1:33:31] yesterday_potato: buff melee
[1:33:31] Moobot: Latest video "We Tried The Most Broken Duo In PvP" view it here: youtu.be/wCEIaMfsDkQ
[1:33:32] Hobblefoot: I actually loved the BFA C9 games.
[1:33:32] Yaycarrots: MLD PepeHiss
[1:33:45] shugguls: 15min of mage lock games where not fun to watch
[1:33:45] suspicious94: stun drs are a nightmare in solo
[1:33:48] Kalakbar: #noteffective
[1:33:52] Symo85: I remember the rogue conversation in AWC. People were talking about spec bans
[1:33:58] thepk85: Look there's an enh
[1:34:00] thepk85: nerf it too
[1:34:04] thepk85: its at the top of ladder
[1:34:06] Devcomz: Does that website have a representation of what is played above 2100-2400
[1:34:10] syphonx23: Well two out of the three of them are the same person
[1:34:12] robfrmamzn: not saying they're bad in shuffles cuz their dmg is good but im saying not as good as 3s
[1:34:12] dewwy_o: played with a guy the other day, hes #1,2,3 for solo shuff in assass
[1:34:25] ArdellanDH: Rogues are fine but they need to have a CD to their cheapshots because you cannot get out of unless you get a trinket or your teammates need to be very fast to react to stopping them
[1:34:31] Hobblefoot: Per game or per match-up?
[1:34:32] krisdahaka: yep, spec bans should've been here long time ago =/
[1:34:38] iloveyalunn: No idea why we havent gotten spec bansa yet
[1:34:39] krisdahaka: it'll be much more interesting
[1:34:42] iloveyalunn: Would love to see it
[1:34:45] kzloxxx: it's britney bitch
[1:34:51] Rjaxo: what build you playing ven? dont see barrier, is that bis now?
[1:34:55] lukinish: Im just in love
[1:34:56] himpnote: @ArdellanDH ur a DH no need to complain sir
[1:35:01] lukinish: with britney song
[1:35:03] kwingas: I feel like spec bans are kinda controversial
[1:35:06] ganjilicious: blind pick only cool unexpected comps i think
[1:35:11] Symo85: works well with other games like Dota.
[1:35:12] kreyzy8: I think the big this is spec bans would make it even harder for those outside the normal top-4 teams to have a chance
[1:35:21] kreyzy8: because those are the teams that typically play 1 class each
[1:35:22] ArdellanDH: We still die if pressured enough
[1:35:27] PoromGames: what do you think about the mage subspec names/potential themes?
[1:35:28] SpacemanJohn: would like to see if you win with a comp you can't play it again in  that bo3/5
[1:35:39] fovven: winner should get a spec ban too
[1:35:44] imkony: just go straight one class ban
[1:35:44] aaggros: Cheap should have a cd and sub needs to be able to die
[1:35:45] joyrex_j9: why not just do cup-wide bans where each team gets 3 votes and the top 3 are banned for the cup
[1:35:56] claudiogodx: Mungumbala and blades arena eternal ban XD
[1:36:07] joyrex_j9: target bans would be lame
[1:36:08] ImJordanHi: Oh no sub? I guess I'll have to play outlaw LUL
[1:36:09] joyrex_j9: imo
[1:36:19] ImJordanHi: Just do it league of legends style, every game, every match different ban
[1:36:23] ImJordanHi: Depends on map etc
[1:36:26] ArdellanDH: Blizztard needs to bring back ring of valor
[1:36:31] imkony: it would be fun, way more strategizing
[1:36:33] EliteDamit: would definitely like to see a draft based ban like you suggested 1 team bans, other team bans, then teams pick
[1:36:45] Bronloch: <3
[1:36:45] Cheztra: Hey @venruki how do you play frost mage into double melee? i find i can never do enough dmg to win on that and that i's hard to land cc on heal aswell
[1:36:45] Symo85: i like the random pick for each team. gives variety and flavor
[1:37:00] robfrmamzn: veryCat
[1:39:43] dewwy_o: Chair POV
[1:40:48] Yaycarrots: popCat

[1:44:54] shugguls: Any one noticed on the set vote that Arms is the only one where EU want S1 and NA want S3, only one where the vote is different
[1:45:37] Cheztra: yeah
[1:45:40] Cheztra: imhere
[1:45:41] Qyzme: tbh - if they would bring up Bans per Game, than some teams would rather ban a healer specc if they know there is no "real good" option. would hurt more than a "sub-rogue" ban i guess
[1:45:45] shikari01: well now I want to hear
[1:47:10] Cheztra: Alright, thx for the reply :)
[1:47:12] pvalue01: will be a dame shame if there's none announced today
[1:47:14] lilskeets: there are some class changes for 10.2.5 coming
[1:47:15] Qyzme: next patch, at least some PvE Buffs will help Preservation Evoker :)
[1:47:38] willie_stroker_99: Where can we see the patch notes?
[1:47:56] Qyzme: wowhead has them
[1:48:01] Kalakbar: yea
[1:48:02] Qyzme: yes
[1:48:03] lilskeets: yea
[1:48:08] SchnitzelOG: what rating is battle mender?
[1:48:10] willie_stroker_99: Thx
[1:48:18] Bigvuqoffdam: have you fought anyone in arena with the legendary yet
[1:48:19] lilskeets: cdew already makes pres look nice
[1:48:21] Omnadren: we are bringing back the Gilneas
[1:48:30] leeka: servers down till 3pm pst tomorrow
[1:48:40] kusanagi_nine: @SchnitzelOG 50 games won above 1800 iirc
[1:48:40] JustTaki: @Bigvuqoffdam O.O how is it?
[1:49:05] aragarde: alot of the covenant abilities are being converted to other classes of magic, similar to echoing reprimand for rogue being turned to physical damage rather then arcane
[1:49:11] Solastro: the damage from the dot and the on-use is giga nerfed in pvp
[1:49:16] Aypex01: and that’s how it should be. like slightly better and that’s all
[1:49:20] dakotan517: good
[1:49:22] Qyzme: well, i think evoker is getting better but not OP. Why do you think they gonna be OP?
[1:49:25] sahmatei: thank god
[1:49:31] dakotan517: aff always gets padded af lobbys
[1:49:31] himpnote: can you link me the patch notes for tomorro
[1:49:33] Bronloch: why?
[1:49:33] Roxxybolts: thank goooooooooood
[1:49:35] yesterday_potato: why they dead

[1:49:43] kursewalker: hit me with that patch note link pls.
[1:49:45] Saminski: Yo! Been listening in for a bit but just now saw the name "retribuki" lolol what a legend
[1:49:45] PagsGT: Why does everyone think pres will be OP, I'm seeing the Echo buffs, but they'll still be really easy to CC, countered hard by clones and have no damage mitigation
[1:49:48] fovven: where are the notes
[1:49:49] UziiB: aren’t aff locks the worst lock spec? or am i crazy
[1:49:49] lilskeets: @aragarde yea but they said they're buffing echo to account for armor. dunno if sub is even playing it right now though
[1:50:00] Bigvuqoffdam: are there shadow modifiers in the talent tree
[1:50:05] Kalakbar: as god intended
[1:50:11] Roxxybolts: maybe they give aff mobility like arcane to make it even
[1:50:14] Roxxybolts: -_-
[1:50:19] aragarde: I know that, my example was only they were converting spells to other types
[1:50:24] rynosaurwow: @Bigvuqoffdam Like shadow damage increase?
[1:50:32] UziiB: frost dk sucks ass, but lowkey it’s kinda fun
[1:50:32] Bigvuqoffdam: @Roxxybolts a lil fae blink
[1:50:35] Kalakbar: oh they are buffing fw again tomorrow
[1:50:37] Bigvuqoffdam: @rynosaurwow ye
[1:50:38] xqooq: LIKE WHAT ?
[1:50:40] lilskeets: frost seems to work alright in coordinated 3v3, F tier in shuff
[1:50:51] jazzratTV: @venruki hpal, rsham, or rdruid the most fun?
[1:50:53] egrounds: it makes you wonder why they make those decisions, they have to know when they make those changes... Its like they know it's going to hurt the clas prior to implementing it.
[1:50:54] rynosaurwow: @Bigvuqoffdam Only thing is shadow embrace that stacks up to 3 times.
[1:51:01] psychic241: non-existent cause they're bad or cause no 1 plays them
[1:51:02] zachgamegodx: there's an aug evoker whose like #5 in eu rn
[1:51:04] zachgamegodx: wild
[1:51:07] pvalue01: always hard to parse that data because it could be that people just want to q unholy instead --- data isnt independent
[1:51:08] Roxxybolts: aff needs alter time
[1:51:17] zachgamegodx: 4*
[1:51:20] UziiB: holding it down to the fury warriors for life
[1:51:21] Roxxybolts: LUL
[1:51:21] leeka: @Roxxybolts lololol
[1:51:27] zachgamegodx: i saw him 6-0 a lobby with whaazz
[1:51:27] Bigvuqoffdam: bring back deathbolt
[1:51:30] Bigvuqoffdam: !!
[1:51:32] lilskeets: omg no lol
[1:51:33] nightmxz: buff shadowbolt damage another 100%$
[1:51:36] dakotan517: buff warriors
[1:51:38] fadedlolxd: affliction is trash but it still feels like your whole team is always dead against them
[1:51:39] Roxxybolts: keep buffing it until anyone dispels they die
[1:51:40] Roxxybolts: ez pz
[1:51:41] shugguls: needs to get rid of Malific rapture
[1:51:42] Bronloch: Afflicition DoTs need to bounce naturally and inherently
[1:51:42] nightmxz: I want nightfall shadowbolts to PUMP
[1:51:43] zachgamegodx: oblivion is basically that @Bigvuqoffdam
[1:51:55] nightmxz: drain soul is for ez mode lock enjoyers
[1:51:56] bransby09: Make rampant affliction permanent and not a skill and no impact to damage like back in the old days
[1:51:57] Bigvuqoffdam: RAPID CONTAGION rukiGrin
[1:51:57] zachgamegodx: spec is just a single school andy ina world of micros and interrupts
[1:52:05] wackpoetic: Give Warlocks the perma-snare on Corruption
[1:52:13] Roxxybolts: perma snare lel
[1:52:26] rynosaurwow: @Bigvuqoffdam have you been on a WoW break? Haven't seen you on bnet in a while
[1:52:31] Roxxybolts: like you don't have beyblade warriors and nascar WWs and a sublety already in war within
[1:52:32] Roxxybolts: kek
[1:52:35] wackpoetic: S1 Shadowlands RBG's was just 2 Warlocks 2 Boomkins every team
[1:52:36] UziiB: someone link me the patch notes? please
[1:52:38] zachgamegodx: @bransby09 nah, the problem with aff is that it needs to have multiple UA"s out to do dmg bc of dread touch/focused malginancy/malefice rapture etc
[1:52:51] zachgamegodx: there needs to be a spec that can function without 100% uptime on ua
[1:52:53] Bigvuqoffdam: @rynosaurwow yeah have some stuff irl ive been focusing on
[1:53:04] Kalakbar: excellent bubble pepeLaugh
[1:53:10] soddi: This is what we call a horny bubble

[1:53:42] GiiGa07: Haha
[1:53:49] Axtin: rets have always been notorious hpal killers
[1:53:49] bransby09: @zachgamegodx Thats what im saying let them have multiple Ua without a talent that doesnt decrease its damage.
[1:54:35] Yaycarrots: peepoTalk
[1:55:15] Bronloch: just pally sharing bro

[2:06:15] Qyzme: Eating is one of the best things in the world haha
[2:06:20] Kalakbar: yeah the foods you need for good growth aren't fun
[2:06:38] Magottx: Ven I got up to 1900 after that disaster you saw
[2:06:39] Qyzme: ah yeah, i know what you mean :)
[2:06:39] GiiGa07: Same bro
[2:06:40] darkscare1: some people do that
[2:06:44] darkscare1: intermittant fasting
[2:06:46] bigolemooseknuckle: One-meal-a-day is a legit thing
[2:06:56] bransby09: I only eat once a day
[2:06:59] bigolemooseknuckle: I've done it for the last 5 years. Workout 4-5 times a week
[2:07:00] laalaaland22: i can and im a skeleton
[2:07:07] ferahgok: I always say if I could get my nutritional requirement met with like 3 pills a day, I would just do that
[2:07:15] bransby09: sometimes a small snack 200-300 calories as well but usually just 1 meal every 24 hours
[2:07:30] kursewalker: @bigolemooseknuckle yes it is, and ive been eating one meal a day for awhile.  sometimes it's two smaller ones but for the most part it's once
[2:07:33] Bronloch: thats what fighters do for pre weight cut fat loss
[2:07:55] chaps_86: Good afternoon Ven
[2:07:56] 3KuLTV: eating takes up too much time
[2:08:10] Magottx: Dude I was ust pressing buttons
[2:08:15] bigolemooseknuckle: Fat is how you do it
[2:08:20] bigolemooseknuckle: low on carbs, high on fat
[2:08:21] zachgamegodx: It's pretty easy for us big bodybuilders here on twitchc hat
[2:08:21] Kalakbar: they also cut out all liquids and wear garbage bags to sweat more. doesn't mean it's a good idea for regular use
[2:08:30] Magottx: That was hilarious I was bitching about frost mage and somehow THE frost mage is in my lobby lmao
[2:08:34] kursewalker: eat one MRE a day
[2:08:38] kursewalker: ez 3500
[2:08:45] shikari01: Ven, what's the worse sports injury you have sustained if any?
[2:08:51] zachgamegodx: @venruki do you ever watch those old 2000's era videos of ronnie coleman and jay cutler getting prepped for shows and telling ppl how they train and eat
[2:08:53] zachgamegodx: i loved those
[2:08:56] Bronloch: eating once per day is not dangerous
[2:09:04] zachgamegodx: ronnie had to wake up at 3am just to eat
[2:09:16] Kalakbar: sure, but it isn't super pleasant either
[2:09:22] 3KuLTV: Ven whats a good healer to start pvp with?
[2:09:25] leeka: what a nice looking lobby
[2:09:26] shikari01: I had similar, turns out it was just the bicep tendon was inflamed. took about that long to recover too.
[2:09:37] dickman911: this lobby looks, unpleasant
[2:09:44] Qyzme: any healer that is fun
[2:09:49] Bronloch: healthy > pleasant
[2:09:53] 3KuLTV: i was gonna roll disc priest?
[2:09:56] shikari01: Scary
[2:10:04] Qyzme: disc is fine
[2:10:08] trikkSP: if you roll disc ur doomed to play rmp forever
[2:10:09] Qyzme: but any healer is tbh
[2:10:13] 3KuLTV: easy to learn?
[2:10:15] americanmoses18: supraspinatus infraspinatus teres major and subscapularis are all the rotator cuff muscles
[2:10:38] Qyzme: no healer is easy. most intense job in pvp anyways, no matter what class
[2:10:45] americanmoses18: usually at work i see ppl strain supra tendon or partial tear it
[2:11:10] americanmoses18: but if u can raise ur arm at full range of motion with weight its likely not a tear but a strain
[2:11:14] InkdAdam: I think disc is pretty easy and you can kinda do whatever. sit back and heal or go more dps
[2:11:20] Kalakbar: I guess, depends what you want out of life.  If health is all you're after, you could that blueprint bryan johnson published
[2:12:11] americanmoses18: just become sam sulek ezpz
[2:12:12] soddi: you need more nameplates
[2:13:20] hiddensquid13: HPAL is tough to play
[2:13:22] Bigvuqoffdam: that looked so miserable
[2:15:13] trikkSP: do double dispell?
[2:15:55] hiddensquid13: yeah it did
[2:15:57] FarvaWW: do u actually like healing or just do it for fast queues? i keep trying to just q as healer as a lifelong dps player lol
[2:16:01] FarvaWW: its just miserable for me
[2:16:10] FarvaWW: feel like u cant carry as healer as much
[2:16:30] Bluebrood7: Bluebrood7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 79 months! 
[2:17:03] soddi: seeing venruki and absterge breeze to 2,4 tells you, you not only can carry as heal, you have to carry
[2:19:36] soddi: i'd say positioning and cd management is to most critical part of healing (instead of e.g. doing pure pressure as dps)
[2:19:44] dirtydx: what if you commentated your games saying everything you are thinking and going to do and why
[2:20:19] hiddensquid13: oh this a banger!!!
[2:22:36] itsallrngasf: @venruki can you show your graphic settings after the shuffle?
[2:22:45] Schnellmusic: @Tricepticon ok

[2:26:19] kusoneko: @Qyzme same lol, ranked queues on Crystal havent popped in months. literal dead game
[2:26:20] Enme4: I've played FFXIV pvp, it's pretty bad, it's gotten better but you literally have entirely different spells compared to your usual spells, it's weird
[2:26:51] Qyzme: @kusoneko they pop, just play the first weeks of a new season. after its dead. only casual works ^^
[2:27:11] Schnellmusic: MM not farming this lobby is sus

[3:35:49] Yaycarrots: mls was the best comp at the end of cata, wasn't it
[3:36:05] ManaoKungPao: I mean that's just how it is when you're playing something that's already been played before
[3:36:29] malvarcla: Feel bad for the mage

[3:53:45] Varaben: that was an easy 0-6 for the mage with 2 hunters
[3:53:46] zachgamegodx: he picks upolifted spirits instead
[3:53:51] rekt1370: only a pally could give that mage wins
[3:53:57] Varaben: @Nated0gz the music gets muted on the vods
[3:54:07] skez_live: this mog is incredible
[3:54:13] RoidRooster: Priest wouldnt purge.. No reason we couldnt strip him.. DH trranq and disc

[3:54:41] n0bodygood: rdru / *
[3:54:43] Varaben: @Nated0gz this is why streaming on youtube sucks cause if you play music like this, it just gets de-monetized. Not sure if there's a way around it for youtube streamers
[3:54:46] chaps_86: lmao, true
[3:54:54] Metaphors: dk mage prob the worst shuffle combo
[3:55:02] 3KuLTV: hard to play mage though in pvp?

[3:56:10] Dupreme_Weems: 98% is nuts lmao
[3:56:13] Varaben: people wanted less burst, the result is damp
[3:56:30] Xeliumimar: the game is still really, really bursty LOL
[3:56:37] GeezerpunkRs: What is your favorite race/class combo purely based on looks

[3:56:55] TheBAMSportsShow: TheBAMSportsShow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! lets go!
[3:56:59] flawfox: someone in your chat was like "that's why no one plays healer" after the 98% damp game finished .. I didn't understand :D
[3:57:01] Varaben: @Xeliumimar 100%, just saying its LESS bursty. But maybe that isnt even true I dunno. I'm just saying they made the pvp crit changes and reduced the damage on the pvp trinket bonus to reduce burst.
[3:57:05] mixlife: only
[3:57:05] hiddensquid13: thankfully at my level we like to hit all buttons in the middle of the map. v fun
[3:57:11] nightmxz: damage isn't sticky enough but there would need to be big changes to the game for that style to work
[3:57:15] mixlife: I’m dying over here in Texas at 38

[3:58:13] ManaoKungPao: it's kind of like in the midwest where the first day it's like 50 degrees outside it's definitely shorts and tshirt weather. But at the end of summer when we get into 50 degree days you feel like it's getting really cold
[3:58:23] StromicusRex: its like 20-30 today and tomorrow and our lovely (shitty) grid people are telling us to conserve energy :)

[4:02:59] OfaSama: I know it's probably not your area of expertise but for demon hunters, If The Hunt and elysian decree do chaos damage naturally do we still take any means necessary in PvP?
[4:03:03] hiddensquid13: with a scotch and cigar, yerrrp

[4:27:22] rekt1370: ven is 42
[4:27:32] chaps_86: @rekt1370 lol
[4:27:33] flopper3: dude does look a lot older than ven though for sure
[4:27:34] Magottx: seems good seein its in execute phase right
[4:27:46] N0170V3D: the thing is sometimes u need that 50k dmg to kill some1
[4:27:50] Varaben: its off gcd isnt it
[4:27:57] Varaben: seems aight
[4:27:58] Itankarenas: it's high impact dmg
[4:28:07] Kalakbar: yeah rekt1370 ven actually did the voiceover for the first fallout.  "war.  war never changes"
[4:28:09] spacemanwx: execute procs are better over all, Fatal mark has gotten super nerfed recently
[4:28:20] rekt1370: @Kalakbar  i knew it the OG
[4:28:22] Magottx: in long games when you cant finish too and it builds up higher stacks its good
[4:28:27] N0170V3D: even if it procs u dont get to spam it
[4:28:40] Dupreme_Weems: Yeah SD builds into a stronger MS tho so i favor it still
[4:28:43] N0170V3D: so fatal is better for me
[4:28:48] rekt1370: fatal mark def good that damage is on top of your execute
[4:29:02] lilskeets: pvp dummy
[4:29:03] chubmax: pvp one dies
[4:29:05] Dupreme_Weems: the solo one get there and stays there
[4:29:05] yesterday_potato: pvp
[4:29:07] lilskeets: it loses hp
[4:29:07] coledplay: pvp one drops health
[4:29:08] snosiop: the pvp one next to honor
[4:29:11] Magottx: i say drop the pvp heal and get them both
[4:29:17] Magottx: dep wound heal*
[4:29:33] N0170V3D: or that true...
[4:29:52] zachgamegodx: arms has very little finishing dmg, fatal mark is neccessary imo, it just uscks into paladins since stacks reset on bop
[4:29:55] Magottx: unless its like bm uh i dont run it
[4:30:14] N0170V3D: @zachgamegodx i think so to
[4:30:17] Dupreme_Weems: Idk i feel like on War stacking buffs is more importnat than hitting the STRONGEST button for the moment. Like MS over SD isnt always better.
[4:30:51] hiddensquid13: yeah double OP CS sharpen MS. hits hard
[4:30:56] Dupreme_Weems: fr fr
[4:30:57] robfrmamzn: HUHH
[4:31:21] Dupreme_Weems: hit a 475k MS crit one time i was like ... damn
[4:31:49] hiddensquid13: yeah if the stars align with all the buffs. i could see it
[4:32:18] Dupreme_Weems: Double Execute, double OP, Sharpen, human so i was playing double dps trinket atm, Weapon proc all that
[4:34:22] zachgamegodx: prolly on a mage

[4:58:34] Magottx: i swear this video is a bait troll or something lol
[4:58:35] ooPickleRicKoo: disc is b
[4:58:36] Thamusx: @Dwilk20 i only saw frost dk in c tear, unless there was a D tear LUL
[4:58:36] ShaHugs: why is the monk symbol half mw/half ww
[4:58:42] pvalue01: @ShaHugs fistweaver
[4:58:49] tarth_100: People play a lot of disc, but its def behind rdruid, hpal and rsham
[4:58:58] tarth_100: but I guess rsham doesn't exist for this ttier
[4:58:59] Dwilk20: @Thamusx they have different list from range and melee and healers
[4:58:59] InkdAdam: I’d agree disc drops off now that everyone is geared
[4:58:59] Magottx: disc=holy  ??
[4:59:00] ooPickleRicKoo: evoker is def not c lol
[4:59:18] Thamusx: @Dwilk20 ohhhhhhhhhhh, gotcha, ty
[4:59:24] dialupinternetconnection: Holy priest F tier
[4:59:26] shocketh: you take all the damage though, its just delayed
[4:59:45] zachgamegodx: it’s like brewmaster stagger without any way to clear it
[4:59:45] joyrex_j9: yeah I think mitigation would imply actually stopping the damage not just smoothing it
[4:59:47] Varaben: but smoothing out the damage means less overhealing on hots, so maybe its sort of damage mitigation?
[4:59:47] Kalakbar: over 50 seconds.  the purpose of dmg mit is to smooth out spikes
[4:59:54] IamWalnuts: would you consider Ray of Hope damage reduction?
[4:59:57] Varaben: seems like a stretch
[5:00:02] lilskeets: feels odd to do a tier list right now when the patch comes out tomorrow with huge pres voker buffs inc
[5:00:13] Dwilk20: Time Dil is not damage mid its damage slow down lol
[5:00:14] Varaben: for a 1 min cd its stronk
[5:00:14] healhut: just requires more coordination than other cds
[5:00:25] Magottx: mit·i·gate /ˈmidəˌɡāt/ verb make less severe, serious, or painful. "he wanted to mitigate misery in the world"
[5:00:38] joyrex_j9: it does indeed make the damage less severe
[5:00:41] shocketh: ya and then you just get cc'd through it and they never swap and you take 75k ticks of TD
[5:00:43] joyrex_j9: so it would count as mitigation
[5:00:51] Gumjob69: sick mog
[5:00:53] skez_live: its used as that for sure, but its not like a wall or a shield that straight just stops a % of dmg
[5:00:54] papaript: It’s not an “oh sh*t” button though, takes some thought. Other classes have that button when all else falls apart
[5:01:07] Kalakbar: 1 minute, but you can spec into CDR
[5:01:15] shocketh: ya but whats the downside to iron bark or sac
[5:01:24] YoMamaSoFine69: its like ps
[5:01:28] IamWalnuts: it gives you globals to catch up
[5:01:43] joyrex_j9: sac makes you take a portion of the damage you mitgate, ironbark has no downside because druids are gods
[5:01:50] Shezzmou: all of this talk is taking away from the fact that unholy dk is now an A tier spec lol
[5:01:51] Dwilk20: I mean Cdews Dragon is the highest rated healer in 3s but Dragon healers are really hard to play with for most people
[5:01:51] Kalakbar: @shocketh maybe they should have a downside
[5:01:59] NaQi15: xD <3
[5:02:20] shocketh: agreed, but if they don't then TD needs to change because people dont ever swap off TD and as pres you get micro'd by everything verdant and 30 yard range @Kalakbar
[5:02:22] IamWalnuts: that guy has killed all the horde leaders
[5:02:24] ShaHugs: that pally mog is so overused
[5:02:26] Somanie: Looks like Swifty almost from way back
[5:02:27] Dwilk20: Dragons also dont heal Ranged because Ranged do the Triangle offense
[5:02:40] Magottx: i love rebound against destro
[5:02:40] Dwilk20: dont heal ranged effectively
[5:02:44] Kalakbar: you don't need to verdant to people, you can echo them and verdant yourself
[5:02:49] skez_live: would be cool if WHILE taking the dilated dmg, you were empowered on your hots or something
[5:02:51] Zeniticon: didnt you say playing without sharpen was trolling ?
[5:02:52] shocketh: and heal for 105% less
[5:02:52] Slayer_Eagleone: DansGame NO SHARPEN???!
[5:02:53] Kalakbar: but yeah, I agree pres is in a rough spot
[5:02:54] shocketh: ?
[5:02:55] Varaben: @Dwilk20 or they do the straight line, each going 30 yards in opposite directions of the dragon
[5:02:58] Slayer_Eagleone: ???
[5:03:21] chaps_86: intervened pet stun. what a god
[5:03:53] Juancki: Yup, hate to be the Lock here hahahah
[5:03:54] Somanie: Pres looks fun af for keys though
[5:04:14] rekt1370: this is the average lock lobby
[5:04:14] Kalakbar: I actually hated it in keys, people keep moving like spazzes out of your dream breath pepeLaugh
[5:04:29] Somanie: Shiiii that's their problem KEKW
[5:04:30] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[5:04:35] Dwilk20: It is rather funny that Rdruids havent gotten nerfed still even with the complaints and the clear stats proving they need to be nerfed again and this time actually nerf them
[5:04:41] Kalakbar: it was great fun in raids, since you had other heals to help you if people moved
[5:04:54] Kalakbar: you could also energy loop spam in raids too for mana back
[5:05:17] Somanie: The Pres tier set banks on Living Flame a lot though iirc, and there are talents that make them crit and split to multiple ppl, etc
[5:05:37] Somanie: So just hope they live long enough for a Flame KEKW
[5:05:39] Kalakbar: yeah, next tier is going to be a lot more fun
[5:05:59] chaps_86: rdruid healing lol
[5:06:01] gilgameshxt: SeemsGood
[5:06:22] chaps_86: ruh roh george
[5:06:28] joyrex_j9: maybe they're keeping resto druid like this because its a beta test for a healer that a bot can play
[5:06:34] rekt1370: yea going to go on dk just for the set LUL
[5:06:51] Swertson: warrior more fun than ww monk?
[5:07:07] pvalue01: no tuning posted yet monkaS
[5:07:08] rekt1370: id say warrior is more fun than ww
[5:07:12] rekt1370: at this moment
[5:07:25] Somanie: Intellect druid specs are my absolute favorite idc
[5:08:43] Itankarenas: that dfestro didnt kite very well
[5:09:00] Varaben: lock was in the last game
[5:09:01] gilgameshxt: NotLikeThis
[5:09:01] pvalue01: war is the easiest class to play and it's very good...good recipe for a fun time
[5:09:11] JustTaki: Awe
[5:09:17] gilgameshxt: Kreygasm
[5:09:22] chaps_86: swap rdruid
[5:09:35] whippy403: I know arms is better than fury, but is fury still fun to play?
[5:09:40] rekt1370: yea fury is fun
[5:11:57] DoYouWannaHug: Sheeeesh
[5:12:00] gilgameshxt: What do you think about rshaman!I have played ele and rshaman and I like both!what alt class would you recomend?!
[5:12:03] gilgameshxt: SeemsGood
[5:12:07] tristalien: he's him
[5:12:11] DoYouWannaHug: Ill always take that with locks
[5:12:29] chubmax: no sharpne?
[5:12:35] InkdAdam: ven on warrior is going to get them nerfed…goated
[5:12:44] chaps_86: Have a good night Ven!
[5:12:47] Swertson: why is ww monk not fun anymore? @venruki
[5:13:36] yesterday_potato: just healed SS for 5 hours straight. Im doing my part! and im also freakin done
[5:14:04] Slayer_Eagleone: warriors get ccd more than healers do lol
[5:15:10] chubmax: 33m SS queue lol
[5:15:17] rekt1370: guy ran spell bop into a mm hunter
[5:15:36] bugTV: rukiBlankie
[5:15:48] Dwilk20: MM hunter is less dangerous to a Ret than a Destro
[5:15:59] rekt1370: you guys training the destro
[5:16:05] rekt1370: and mm has really good execute damage
[5:17:38] malvarcla: I love the gnome sounds
[5:17:49] JustTaki: oh snap! Gnomobility is almost duelist :o
[5:17:52] Sindorii: what was that purple cloud u were going after?
[5:18:12] TechNiick: @venruki don’t you feel like you play the game in slow motion as warr compared to ww?
[5:18:15] rekt1370: ww gets cced and kited so easy
[5:18:27] rekt1370: compared to dh dk ww
[5:18:41] Kalakbar: blound
[5:18:46] FoxisFitness: Hey I was the rdruid any tip you saw i did wrong?
[5:18:51] FoxisFitness: its an alt
[5:18:56] Kalakbar: short *and* stout
[5:18:57] FoxisFitness: still learning the spec
[5:18:58] Dwilk20: That is cause Bladestorm is broken
[5:19:11] rekt1370: no bladestorm and warriors get rolled tho
[5:19:16] rekt1370: thats why fury is bad
[5:19:20] that_man_ski: Serenity should be postponed while the monk is CC'ed. Similar to how Adrenalin rush is for outlaw rogues.
[5:19:21] chaosemperor77: warrior not op at all
[5:19:26] InkdAdam: I miss being able to disarm bladestorm
[5:19:45] Kalakbar: yeah, like ring of peace into barrier
[5:19:47] Papa_Africa: From the ret pally you just whooped in that solo shuffle, gg mate!
[5:19:48] Dwilk20: Arms and Ret can both spend 6month as being trash and I am okay with it they just spent 6 months of being the best 2 specs in the game
[5:19:51] Kalakbar: or smoke bomb and people dying
[5:19:55] Dwilk20: I say this as someone who plays Arms
[5:19:59] Dwilk20: Bladestorm is broken
[5:20:13] zachgamegodx: it is nice to press cloak of shadows and not worry about a damn thing for 6seconds
[5:20:13] FoxisFitness: @Papa_Africa Pls play Sanc next time :)
[5:20:30] Dwilk20: 1min bladestorm that 70% snare on top of spinning off of Avatar its dumb and again I play warrior
[5:20:37] gilgameshxt: What do you think about rshaman!?I am an ele main but jave played both and i like it!
[5:20:38] Borngood: hows it going today
[5:20:46] Borngood: nice
[5:21:12] Imcando: holy priest would be fun to watch
[5:21:14] Zeniticon: pala too ?

[5:21:20] TechNiick: toxic button tier list? Keepo
[5:21:22] sniposnipo: holy priest feels so bad :(
[5:21:30] gilgameshxt: I love some of the strong totems that can make a difference in a match
[5:21:34] FinkleTheMage: I've seen some really good Hpriests
[5:21:43] Dwilk20: Death Grip

[5:22:08] timmah25: abomb limb isnt even that toxic anymore
[5:22:08] noskinblondeguy: dark pac
[5:22:10] Ey_an: its cyclone

[5:22:19] Borngood: cloak being bubble
[5:22:24] InkdAdam: death grip, shadowy duel, cyclone with no cd, bladestorm
[5:22:26] kjjuu: frost nova
[5:22:26] FinkleTheMage: I agree, we needed blast wave so bad
[5:22:27] chaosemperor77: cyclone for sure
[5:22:28] zachgamegodx: blast wave is fine, its that talent below it that makes it not ok
[5:22:34] Borngood: yup
[5:22:35] zachgamegodx: the improvement thing that makes it a nuclear launch
[5:22:36] VetisBR: knocks in eots is the worst. cant even go mid ever
[5:22:40] thegamer90s: babushka i know what it means?
[5:22:47] notoriousztv: slowfall

[5:33:03] skez_live: maybe he missclicked
[5:33:15] skez_live: twice
[5:33:17] skez_live: lol
[5:33:23] uhdaptiv: i hardly saw boomy cloning the whole game up until that point too KEKW
[5:33:26] soddi: there is a universe out there where someone misclicked 3 perfect clones back to back
[5:33:37] skez_live: @soddi hahah exactly
[5:33:53] skez_live: "hes like oops i thought that was my focus macro"
[5:35:41] Schnellmusic: system of a down + fire mage solo shuffle, I can already guess how long into the stream we are lol
[5:35:41] Moobot: Latest video "This Is What 98% Dampening Looks Like In Arena" view it here: youtu.be/6MTs3fEdeXs

[5:42:27] Diriculous: tell the pres evoker he's S tier :D
[5:42:28] joyrex_j9: I mean he ran in out of our range and died
[5:42:31] uhdaptiv: unfortunately that doesnt matter much in the current game @sourbutts
[5:43:23] flawfox: @uhdaptiv Ofc it does
[5:43:48] animeintrovibes: Lol
[5:45:28] joyrex_j9: monk just throws twice :(
[5:45:55] joyrex_j9: I mean I cant heal fire mage
[5:45:57] joyrex_j9: so its cursed
[5:46:05] shroomkinz: that monk didn’t throw it was def sham
[5:46:11] joyrex_j9: if the monk was a bit more patient
[5:46:14] shroomkinz: how can he static in line
[5:46:14] joyrex_j9: mighta gotten 2
[5:46:19] shroomkinz: also monk used two walls
[5:46:25] betonmicha92: hey @venruki i just waited 40 min for a shuffle as dps on 1,6 mmr, is that normal?
[5:46:25] shroomkinz: diffuse and dampen
[5:46:37] Badasti: blizz be like lets nerf your hp to do have the dam of a dh LUL
[5:46:42] uhdaptiv: seeing you struggle in lobbies like that against 2k players really makes me question why i play the game hah
[5:46:56] joyrex_j9: a lot of melee just don't really know how to play with a caster
[5:47:41] fadedlolxd: daily dose of joe raging EleGiggle
[5:47:41] uhdaptiv: 2k in everything that isnt shuffle lol
[5:47:55] flawfox: Can’t really look at singular lobbies, gotta observe a wider amount of lobbies as shuffle is about consistency
[5:49:26] Badasti: everyone else sweating their balls of, dh singing along while destroying everything
[5:49:46] zachgamegodx: holy paladin can die guys...to the demon class only tho

[6:02:37] thaizee: talk dogwater
[6:02:39] storebraad: Venruki is the only stream i am following and i love the content. But it is a special sort of excitement to watch him on a mage, it is literally delightful, even as i hate that class.
[6:02:39] waterfeesh: i think hes actually just encouraging u to be toxic

[6:04:31] vmills: can you purge off a mages ability to blink back to prior blink location. cant recall the name
[6:04:40] malvarcla: that moment you get more bops from the opposing team by spellstealing than your 2 paladin teammates
[6:04:40] waterfeesh: displacement
[6:04:49] ExylTheElf: @gamer_dad_01 guess i'll keep tuning in more and more.
[6:04:54] GnRHDota2: enemy hpally position turned that round
[6:04:58] waterfeesh: @vmills  idk tho. You could when they first introduced the ability way back when
[6:04:59] gamer_dad_01: @ExylTheElf Good call
[6:05:27] FinkleTheMage: @vmills Displacement? No you can't
[6:05:29] waterfeesh: The hell, since when could mages time warp
[6:05:33] animeintrovibes: They should buff g pie and make it a shorter cast, that would be fun on fire

[6:06:27] chubmax: lol
[6:07:30] animeintrovibes: Oh I seen it, I played destro lock s4 bfa, loved my fire mage buddies loo
[6:07:37] GnRHDota2: that ret paladin is not using kick on any poly
[6:07:43] waterfeesh: Wasn't arcane really good at one point? Not sure what spec to play
[6:07:53] FinkleTheMage: Are you playin full mastery Ven?
[6:07:57] waterfeesh: oh really
[6:09:07] waterfeesh: I was gonna assume fire was the best because its been the most versatile spec since after wrath
[6:09:15] waterfeesh: for solo q that is
[6:09:26] wtfs_a_twitch: @waterfeesh i think this is very far from being true
[6:09:34] wtfs_a_twitch: but maybe im wrong
[6:09:35] rekt1370: arcane is crazy
[6:09:50] waterfeesh: @wtfs_a_twitch well ven just said fire is the worst for soloq now
[6:10:02] FinkleTheMage: I think fire is great in lower games, arcane becomes better once your team enables you for the set ups
[6:10:13] waterfeesh: @wtfs_a_twitch which part are you talking about tho
[6:10:16] wtfs_a_twitch: ah im in an ad - but yeah both frost and arcane are great. Fire is just not that great and i dont think it typically is very great
[6:10:31] waterfeesh: Its been the best spec for seasons now
[6:10:47] wtfs_a_twitch: im not sure that fire has been the best during any season of dragonflight
[6:10:56] waterfeesh: Ah ya I havent played df mage
[6:11:19] waterfeesh: That makes me happy tho
[6:11:23] yesterday_potato: you what on him
[6:11:25] waterfeesh: frost and arcane are my favorite specs
[6:11:25] animeintrovibes: Fire would pump so hard rn it they didn't change glass cannon lol
[6:11:37] Not_Spor: @yesterday_potato he busted on his face
[6:11:40] waterfeesh: MOP arcane was goated
[6:11:53] vmills: @animeintrovibes what change did they make/when?
[6:12:04] waterfeesh: spellsteal costing 0 mana and the glyph that healed u every time you stole a spell
[6:12:08] waterfeesh: lol
[6:12:11] FinkleTheMage: @vmills Used to be 100% increase to ignite
[6:12:52] waterfeesh: I wish frost had deep freeze and / or a root that wasn't dispellable
[6:13:08] vmills: I see less increase for same base health reduction I assume
[6:13:15] animeintrovibes: Conflag root was goated lol
[6:13:28] waterfeesh: feels like frost often struggles in recent expacs because its hard to keep a gap between melee and find time to cast
[6:13:32] FinkleTheMage: @vmills It went down by 5% hp reduction I believe
[6:13:51] waterfeesh: @animeintrovibes u talkin the conflag stun?
[6:14:00] waterfeesh: or was there a season with a conflag root lol
[6:14:00] FinkleTheMage: @waterfeesh Not so much in this xpac, we have tons of mobility now

[6:17:53] FinkleTheMage: yuuuup
[6:17:58] waterfeesh: blast wave knocks back?
[6:18:03] FinkleTheMage: It does, and slows
[6:18:05] waterfeesh: YES
[6:18:12] waterfeesh: that was my favorite spell
[6:18:21] FinkleTheMage: It's essential right now, with all the gap closers
[6:18:28] tidusisthedream: IF I SPIN IN MY CHAIR TILL U GET BACK DOES IT COUNT THAT I DIDNT GO ANYWHERE?
[6:18:29] waterfeesh: so sad when they ruined it by making it just a slow thats cast like pet nova
[6:18:42] waterfeesh: blast wave
[6:18:43] Ambersulfr: are air fryer burgers good???
[6:18:47] Yoseirl: havent played since S1 DF, bought full honor gear and got queued into a 2300 lobby went 0-6... ya im done for today lol

[6:25:16] Marshypie: Hey Ven what are your thoughts on if we could q solo as multiple specs?
[6:25:22] Schnellmusic: :)
[6:25:27] waterfeesh: NotLikeThis
[6:25:31] Nihilistx: oh cool thank you
[6:25:39] Ambersulfr: if you wanted to, you could form a LFG for AWC and sign up together
[6:26:35] Ambersulfr: the lower your rating (your seed) the more likely you’ll be put against the top seeds, but otherwise it’s all equal
[6:26:37] chrisiirc: that triple voker youtube video was funny ven
[6:26:47] chrisiirc: loved it
[6:26:54] Magottx: Ven can you copy your sarena settings somehow?

[6:26:59] ram13ll: can anyone join you hehe?
[6:27:12] organicsungrown: what’s ur group called @venruki
[6:27:41] waterfeesh: I wish they would just scrap the honor grind needed for pvp
[6:27:43] Magottx: i like how yours has just one spell for every dr. gladius can get confusing
[6:27:46] ram13ll: can you share you plater profile pls? i like how you can see the cooldowns on enemy health bars
[6:27:57] waterfeesh: It would be nice if they gave u the basic honor set and only made u grind for conq gear
[6:28:09] Ambersulfr: stream awc teams, Kappa
[6:28:18] Ambersulfr: that would be pretty entertaining
[6:28:22] ram13ll: ty

[6:29:24] Ambersulfr: let’s go
[6:29:47] soddi: maybe changed for 2s :)
[6:30:01] waterfeesh: I'm the reason in game transactions exist
[6:30:25] wackpoetic: waterfeesh cheaper to buy a wow token and pay gold for the boost. takes a few hours but you'd have gold to spare for 1/3 the cost
[6:30:40] memil141: dang
[6:30:40] waterfeesh: @wackpoetic what the heck lol
[6:31:11] waterfeesh: @wackpoetic good to know tho
[6:31:49] waterfeesh: holy fk game time costs a dick load of gold
[6:32:18] zinisterzz: its because the price for the gold boost is actually set by supply and demand the 70 boost has always been 60 bucks lol
[6:32:22] waterfeesh: i mean i always buy my gold and sub, but thats kinda crazy
[6:32:42] waterfeesh: arcajne looks wicked
[6:33:06] waterfeesh: arcane mop tho
[6:33:22] Reign_TV: i made tacos
[6:33:25] waterfeesh: constant movement speed buff, shatter 1 shots, and invincibility with spellsteal glyph
[6:33:30] V0Xgrey: pork ribs and rice
[6:33:35] Carmen_nem: eating a gallon of kimchi
[6:33:37] NozakGaming: im making tomato bisque and grilled cheese because its cold af outside and my 4 year old is sick.
[6:33:45] waterfeesh: @Carmen_nem LOL
[6:33:47] betasoldier: Just finished General Tso's chicken from a new chinese place. Think we found our new regular chinese restaurant.
[6:33:52] backstreetalright: vegie tempura
[6:33:58] urjack: cheese and crackers
[6:34:00] waterfeesh: @betasoldier PF changs?
[6:34:04] waterfeesh: 4Head
[6:34:26] NozakGaming: that stuff is good.
[6:34:28] joyrex_j9: expensive but good
[6:34:30] NozakGaming: i like green onion kimchi a lot
[6:34:41] joyrex_j9: I feel like kimchi shouldnt be TOO hard to make
[6:34:50] zinisterzz: sometimes you gotta pay for for quality
[6:35:07] joyrex_j9: absolutely
[6:35:35] Keveldinho: was that a sub rogue
[6:35:53] joyrex_j9: fermented stuff is delish

[6:35:59] withthedraco: do you have any recommendations for heroic paladin streamers?
[6:36:03] wowsuomi: Do u ever cook tpfu
[6:36:03] withthedraco: not heroic
[6:36:06] withthedraco: retribution sorry
[6:36:08] withthedraco: im a beginner
[6:36:26] Slayer_Eagleone: DansGame
[6:36:33] chrisiirc: thatd make me think id get kidney stones
[6:36:34] Keveldinho: you were vegan? why did you stop
[6:36:35] Slayer_Eagleone: how do you even gain muscle like that?
[6:36:36] chrisiirc: lol
[6:36:41] Zeniticon: why'd yopu quit ?
[6:36:48] joyrex_j9: legumes and beans baby
[6:36:51] withthedraco: i meant to ask for recommendations on ret pally streamers and youtubers? i am a beginner. appreciate any recommendations @venruki
[6:37:03] Birthdayy: being vegan is not healthy for most people
[6:37:09] Zaibone: do you mostly play ally for the racials?
[6:37:13] Keveldinho: that Albert’s beef though lol
[6:37:13] vmills: dang did you see the results for the tier sets are in (about 3 hours ago)
[6:37:15] backstreetalright: to save the blue planet?
[6:37:25] Keveldinho: Alberta***
[6:37:50] Deezulll: Lots of reasons: 1) Chicken 2) Beef 3) Pork 4) Fish LUL
[6:37:56] Birthdayy: you miss out on a lot of nutrients. Its good for some with certain health issues, but its hard to exercise a ton and recover quickly on a vegan diet. Also hard to get vitamin b12
[6:38:08] vmills: lol Albert’s beef @keveldinho
[6:38:17] joyrex_j9: you can do it with a lot of meticulous supplementation
[6:39:01] joyrex_j9: it's possible but it's a lot of effort
[6:39:38] Schnellmusic: lmfao
[6:39:38] joyrex_j9: best case scenario is probably going to be lab grown meat that isn't the highly processed seed oil crap we currently have, if ethics are your concern
[6:39:43] Schnellmusic: poor warrior
[6:40:01] waterfeesh: My uncle got got really sick with a vegan diet. His doctor said, your system is literally shutting down. You need to eat at least 1 red steak a week.
[6:40:32] Schnellmusic: this is actually hilarious
[6:40:44] waterfeesh: lmao this reminds me of mop
[6:40:47] joyrex_j9: holy shit you almost instakilled me
[6:40:47] Nihilistx: I wanted to try something new a few years ago. did vegan for about 7 hours before I was dry heaving.
[6:40:56] joyrex_j9: him*
