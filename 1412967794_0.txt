[1:29:53] KonaWolfeee: chat that's for gold portal
[1:29:57] 7th_sons: I haven't played pvp yet. Is it good?
[1:29:57] Sevenix: killing boss has a chance to spawn rare portals, so many quit after that and try again.
[1:30:00] PhAnToM1004: @CrossThread if the special portal doesnt spawn the 3rd part is considered a waste of time
[1:30:07] franmonita: hi
[1:30:09] Kameellian: @KonaWolfee thanks!
[1:30:09] KonaWolfeee: if they don't see it right away they leave quicker chances for red or gold portal
[1:30:12] CrossThread: oooooh
[1:30:19] OvenMonkeyGaming: @Towelliee argos will be first real raid and have 3 phases first phase should be 1370 to get in then 2nd 1385
[1:30:30] gaming0kitsune: you have a chance to get into a special treasure room
[1:30:32] OvenMonkeyGaming: then 1400 for third phase

[1:47:21] realestwoke: @Towelliee have you started working on any of your rapport?
[1:47:25] ProButcher: I'm only really curious as to why western servers were introduced at a higher difficulty than the east to begin with
[1:47:32] JeemTeam: nope, dont be a dumbshit, lol
[1:47:36] AWreal: it's also just easy content that you slam down daily.. very easy to just zone out and forget to loot
[1:47:38] KonaWolfeee: ^
[1:47:44] KristallReiner: they should mail you the reward with a delay as penalty tbh @Towelliee

[1:48:07] marvinmgs: agora e so ir no jogo ?
[1:48:15] ProButcher: People keep freaking out because they hear NERF, and it's such a buzzword, but it's more of an adjustment to just match the rest of the Lost Ark servers
[1:48:22] Alats: @marvinmgs English please.
[1:48:30] jnsnev: any good guide? my pack and pets pack and storage full of stuff plus 14 chest in mail.

[1:53:56] hunnylamb: I failed 4 in a row for tier 1. can't imagine tier 3 life. hunnylChao
[1:54:06] ProButcher: A buddy of mine said something that I thought was accurate yesterday. Doesn't matter how high you get your chance... If it's not 100%, it's 50%
[1:54:10] OvenMonkeyGaming: yo chat in a month they might buff the rates please dont rage

[1:55:30] Scarhearth: the holy lion guardian raid sucks balls
[1:55:34] misomander: they might buff tier 1 and tier 2 success rates to 100% 1-15 based on the original patch notes before the game released
[1:55:35] realmagnatic: is lost ark free to play?
[1:55:41] qompaa: You can do the 2nd tier 3 abyssal now!
[1:55:44] misomander: is what people are guessinhg
[1:55:48] NoAceChase: @realmagnatic yes
[1:55:53] shortyforthewin: will they release a new character ?

[1:59:31] OvenMonkeyGaming: they said at lauch in one month they woyuld drop the raid
[1:59:40] Xialoz: i like it there is not alot to do on a 1340ilvl dude atm
[1:59:42] KonaWolfeee: it doesnt matter if its early. content is great
[1:59:43] Xgodzxsoldier: they would have A LOT of players not ready for it yet if they did.
[1:59:44] abusivebarry: im at 1040 and i feel rushed already lmao, i agree should be slower
[1:59:51] Heero_Effect: Ha majority player base is probably not close to ready lol
[1:59:55] marioleyenda: maybe was on compensation for the guardian nerfs

[2:00:29] Xialoz: dont use it yet
[2:00:37] Xialoz: like 14 to 15 you use
[2:00:47] OvenMonkeyGaming: they wont leave people behind they want everyone to do the content and catch up
[2:01:27] dragonskn: guys I'v 20 hours in game and ƒ±m 33 lvl when  can I reach to 50 level ?
[2:01:30] 91Niki: Guys, stop typing pay to win LUL Moobot is just gonna slam you
[2:01:35] misomander: they could possibly buff success rates but its a material prices issue technically not a honing issue
[2:01:43] J_Rich94: @Towelliee so is honing just upgrading the item level of your current gear?
[2:01:45] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee since before launch weve known argos comes a month after release lol
[2:01:49] Akoudadis: @Towelliee knows shit
[2:01:49] OvenMonkeyGaming: they wont bump you up they will increase honing chance

[2:03:14] Dillhouse: i wonder when we will get the new classes
[2:03:20] DonNizzi: tier 2 to tier 3 is so lame. totally stuck.. everything fails. kinda makes me wanna stop -.-
[2:03:27] NoMSG: its an honest question? trying to ask a f2p question...... @91Niki
[2:03:29] misomander: percentages arent the bottle neck its the materials needed right now prices are way too high to justify one extra tap for gear theres like <5% of people in T3 so theres just no mats
[2:03:30] JustGodKingCole: pepeBASS mornin
[2:03:44] DerpyCatO_O: i mean im only 1341 and im only playing my main. 1370 is a tall order lol
[2:03:51] OvenMonkeyGaming: im waiting for lance master and reaper
[2:03:53] OvenMonkeyGaming: so hard
[2:04:06] OvenMonkeyGaming: i want the road map to come out
[2:04:29] NoMSG: like yikes i cant even ask a real question
[2:04:33] Jal0kin: im only 1020 and im only playing my main lol.
[2:04:34] misomander: what would be nice is the supposed 100% T1/T2 honing success all the way thru lvl 15
[2:04:36] Playermodd: I want my main alt to be a lance master, hopefully they don‚Äôt wait a year to release that class
[2:04:51] 91Niki: @NoMSG Ask a different question then. "How long will i have to grind?"
[2:05:07] OvenMonkeyGaming: lance master is like dragoon
[2:05:08] Toojicle: martial artist
[2:05:10] misomander: its a martial artist subclass
[2:05:13] plout0n: like dragoon i think

[2:05:19] KonaWolfeee: @Towelliee MARITIAL ARTIST lance class. its insane
[2:05:20] Xgodzxsoldier: lance master is essentially the dragoon
[2:05:27] JustGodKingCole: Why did they remove summoner off the starting launch?
[2:05:29] klurtyy: Martial artist who uses a spear, ranged and melee
[2:05:30] AndroniusMaximus: lance master uses 2 different spears.
[2:05:38] highkoalaity: Do you get more loot in chaos dungeons as a group vs solo??
[2:05:39] Playermodd: It‚Äôs a martial artist, looks super fun to play
[2:05:47] Darkpepp: Ragnaros EU died, any realm lagged?
[2:05:48] tydevane: fast paced dragoon
[2:05:51] DerpyCatO_O: @highkoalaity no
[2:06:01] highkoalaity: @DerpyCatO_O ty
[2:06:15] Dillhouse: @highkoalaity only benefit with running with group is you can trade items if needed
[2:06:42] Maranami: Do you get more rewards being in a group in chaos dungeons?
[2:06:44] lukosiukas1: i just hit t2 and its geting nerfed dafak

[2:15:26] NotDotti: i think the shop is meant to lightly supplement levelling other than be the way to level lol
[2:15:41] JustGodKingCole: @NoMSG until reset and then it should feel faster again, cause if you dont have much to do right now and it feels slow thats a somewhat incentive for you to spend that $$$ to make it go faster, right?
[2:16:00] CardinalTX: ill spend some cash on skins or something but not progression. playing at my own pace and dont feel the need to ruch to T3

[2:42:21] JustGodKingCole: gotta be a game that people can never agree upon, like Billy Egg Hatcher
[2:42:24] g4m3r__z3r0: Towel mains Raid Shadow Legends now
[2:43:03] Tyrou: so how bout those T1/T2 nerfs
[2:43:25] Soxal06: hi
[2:43:25] Moobot: Towelliee is playing on Server US EAST - UNA for Lost Ark!
[2:43:40] kinowa: which one is your fauvorite between the gunlancer & the paladin @Towelliee
[2:44:17] Synonymous: towelliee asmon has q;uit wow, can you take over please D:
[2:44:27] KragnosWoW: t3 should be nerfed twice as much Kappa
[2:45:04] Tyrou: if they nerf T3 idk if i will keep playing

[2:46:12] Feldrance: health,yea  abilities, not all of the bosses in that list
[2:46:39] Tyrou: like if they decide to nerf the legion commanders before they even come out then it would be a mistake imo
[2:46:49] RageGamer: if they nerf the health the damage needs to  be buffed, the guardians already arent very challenging
[2:46:57] OvenMonkeyGaming: needs a nerf
[2:47:10] sir_ike: sad to nerf tho because ppl cant take time to learn
[2:47:30] Tydro: im struggling with the t1 scorpion boss :/
[2:47:30] RageGamer: yep its 100% because people wont take 2 min to learn from a guide
[2:47:34] Zaize37: Supposedly they're miscoded on US and not even supposed the have that much health, in Korea they have less and theyre just adjusting to the same point, but idk
[2:47:39] g4m3r__z3r0: Cry babies ruin every MMO. Participation trophy BS ><
[2:48:08] OvenMonkeyGaming: its not midcoded they did it on purpose
[2:48:12] Tyrou: honestly people just need more destruction abilities for this fight
[2:48:13] mmo_kenna_: yous all sound elitist as fuck
[2:48:18] hanyolo07: what did marvin say
[2:48:28] misomander: they just want to get people into tier 3 faster the data shows a much higher retention if/when people reach tier 3

[2:48:38] fred_birkhoff: yep, i read too that the guardian raids have less HP on KR version. and Idk why or who thought it was a good idea to just change the game xd
[2:48:44] KragnosWoW: what exactly is the problem with nerfing the bosses im genuinely curious? the content is 3 years old. go kill wow bosses that are 3 years old its easy af
[2:48:48] g4m3r__z3r0: Not you I mean the over all nerfs of all MMOS the last decade
[2:48:49] fred_birkhoff: just give us the KR version
[2:48:50] RageGamer: if they want a solid nerf, just turn basic attack into a counter :D
[2:48:56] Idahorealtor: They said the bosses where buffed 30% more health before release
[2:49:08] CipansR_Ayaya: Report Marvin
[2:49:12] brewsuadeshoes: That one has an armor mechanic to get through w/ weak point abilities. Corrosive bombs help
[2:49:13] Jokervenom1978: marvin always lets us down
[2:49:14] Jonniboy: omg i hit a stone eg for 15 mins and nothing happend, scr that island
[2:49:14] Tyrou: @KragnosWoW because theonly thing that is different on KR servers is the health
[2:49:32] KragnosWoW: well isnt that all theyre nerfing? is the health?
[2:49:39] CipansR_Ayaya: monkaS
[2:49:39] RageGamer: marvin couldnt believe his life path lead him to replying to a message like that :D
[2:49:40] g4m3r__z3r0: They needed to buff them NA gamers GO HARD
[2:49:43] misomander: stoopzzWICKED johnny B
[2:49:44] Epicsapphire1988: Coke on Marvin
[2:49:49] fred_birkhoff: that, and why did they have to remove the prologues from classes with the option to skip
[2:49:52] Epicsapphire1988: Come

[2:50:24] misomander: i hope his last name is bravo
[2:50:26] brewgamingtv: biggest reason i think some of them raid bosses take so long is people some times are just running around in a circle. They aren't attacking a lot
[2:50:28] CipansR_Ayaya: Open your eyes Johny B
[2:50:48] KragnosWoW: Johnny B. Goode
[2:50:48] LoSuns: A Yo i'm streaming here!!
[2:50:51] g4m3r__z3r0: If anyhting needs nerfed its the progression system NOT the fights or bosses

[3:05:13] MrChemist07: You can buy in shop 50 tickets to fast finish for cheaper price
