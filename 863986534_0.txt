[0:15:49] PoppaShot: soloing it on my 210 rogue was rough @Towelliee but doable
[0:15:50] Ryok: i had to redo layer 1 earlier because i had barely any survivability xD the ghuun looking boss at floor 18 oneshot me with one of his attacks xD
[0:16:02] TheBeastofCaerBannog: the one for the quest line, the lion quest, i got to floor 12 and got shrekked by the boss, couldn't interupt him enough and was hitting me for 18k like every 2 seconds
[0:16:04] goblinknows: best powers for prot pally?
[0:16:08] H0L3S: Would you recommend just full clearing everything on every floor?
[0:16:21] MOLAR305: I had 4 stacks if that and it saved me against elderbranch
[0:16:30] AkuTVgg: I died in floor 17 on layer 1 on my BrM last night. Big sad
[0:16:31] CritcobainTV: Just do what I did man, get the 1.5 minute damage immunity power when you go to the boss floor. EZ Kappa
[0:16:42] gorilla_quantistico: as a dps you get shotted by trash very easily in the last floors
[0:17:16] MOLAR305: maw of the maw is annoying if you don't have stuns

[0:19:29] MrGattz: as a 200ilvl feral druid i had to switch to a tank at the 15th floor because the mobs hit like a truck with 150k hp on trash mobs. wasnt fun

[6:10:36] ExtreemeCheese: Don't get me wrong, I was melting bosses. But it felt like the fire mages were hitting me like a truck
[6:10:42] Epiclurker27893: I beat layer 1 on my pally, 11k armor made up for my low gear score.

[6:18:45] xideontv: cock
[6:18:53] PvtHudson093: 200 soul ash from finishing the bolvar quest
[6:19:05] ZackLimp: @BQAD i would highly recommend doing it as a 5-man group. It's absolutely face roll that way
[6:19:27] BQAD: yeah? even with a bad (atm) class? i play fury @ZackLimp
[6:19:29] OfficerGoose: I got Third Eye on Floor 18 who casts a spell that would do 40k + Overkill... I'm a hunter. It did not end well
[6:20:06] 2bush: Is the mount garuntee ?
[6:20:10] BQAD: yep
[6:20:20] ZackLimp: @BQAD Switch to tank when you do Torghast and find 4 more people. You just have to survive, and let them do the work
[6:20:27] PvtHudson093: it was a joke man
[6:21:02] Panzaah: What talents do you recommend for prot for torghast?
[6:21:10] Daggerstry: Must be nice being a tank..... I couldn't even finish Layer 1
[6:21:25] 2bush: I feel like tanks are the only spec that can solo torg. Anyone else needs full group
[6:21:38] treeshark: it was ez on boomy for me
[6:21:43] BQAD: i can solo on my war (dps) and bm hunter easily tbh
[6:21:47] BQAD: not the TC tho
[6:21:49] Arcazua: how do you not finish layer 1 of torghast?
[6:22:01] bostonwinsx: lasyer 1?
[6:22:14] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee still has his raiding screen up. Has he not put his pants back on yet?
[6:22:23] c4mmweir: Wait is he soloing layer 8?
[6:22:24] PvtHudson093: layer 1 of twisting corridors
[6:22:30] NotDillyTV: laughs in disc priest
[6:22:41] ZackLimp: If you can queue for Random HC Dungeon, you shouldn't have trouble doing Layer 1

[6:24:55] Tessiuz: @bostonwinsx mage could just kite?

[6:25:16] bostonwinsx: kite what?
[6:25:27] BQAD: they better allow progress to be Acc wide. Can you imagine doing this on alts? yikes
[6:25:37] bostonwinsx: its a debuff that stacks per floor taking fire dmg

[6:28:54] bostonwinsx: i did torg today no mount...
[6:29:05] BQAD: twisting corridors..
[6:29:10] BQAD: not the normal tower
[6:29:13] A_P_P_L_E_S: gotta do all of tc
[6:29:15] c4mmweir: Gotta do layer 8 to get mount I thinm
[6:29:26] Blaugznis: hm, ok, can not find a way to hide it if im not in a group
[6:29:26] balerrionhunt: How long did it take you to get through the other 7 layers?
[6:29:32] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[6:29:39] BQAD: boss time monkaS
[6:29:45] bostonwinsx: i got to layer 10 in one... and said F THIS
[6:29:51] bostonwinsx: is that the mount one?
[6:30:13] BQAD: if it has more than 6 layers, it was the mount place
[6:30:26] Daggerstry: Time to try layer 1 again
[6:30:31] Arcazua: there is no layer 10 lmao
[6:30:32] bostonwinsx: i got to layer 10 and had to raid. i heard there is 18 layers
[6:30:39] Whasz: MEELTING!
[6:30:40] BQAD: thats correct. 18
[6:30:53] A_P_P_L_E_S: there is 8 layers
[6:30:55] bostonwinsx: thgis guys nuthin
[6:31:05] PvtHudson093: 18 floors per layer for a grand total of 144 floors
[6:31:06] LockHeart308: @Towelliee me and a buddy were running it today and we both were hitting 200k dps on bosses LUL
[6:31:16] BQAD: EZ Clap ?
[6:31:37] balerrionhunt: How long did it take you to get through the other 7layers?
[6:31:52] bostonwinsx: and you only get a mount?
[6:32:03] BQAD: that allows you to mount on the maw
[6:32:05] balerrionhunt: A mount that you can ride in the Maw
[6:32:07] Aeylid: a mount that can work in the maw
[6:32:08] c4mmweir: Couldn’t kill the last boss in solo
[6:32:17] TheCliffyShow: Slap that boss like it owes you anima.
[6:32:22] Aeylid: last boss solo had 9.6 million health when i got there
[6:32:29] c4mmweir: Yup same
[6:32:33] c4mmweir: Didn’t stand a chance haha
[6:32:36] 2bush: Or a fire mage to just float the boss
[6:32:41] Daggerstry: Like, yesterday when I tried layer 1, I was melting things up until layer 16. Then the boss was just undefeatable because it was Warden of Souls
[6:33:08] bostonwinsx: DKs get additional pets that can tank. so it could be solo possible
[6:33:20] ZackLimp: @Towelliee do you need to reach floor 18 for mount?
[6:33:20] LockHeart308: if you hit a mob in here with the anima orb you gain a buff reducing fire dmg by 65%
[6:33:26] Daverion: I stopped at layer 3 when the last boss was the stone golem you just killed he was crushing me. Best I did was get him to 20%
[6:33:32] PvtHudson093: i hate maw of the maw
[6:33:37] c4mmweir: Ya I watched towellie solo layer 1
[6:33:39] PadidinJones: Hey @Towelliee hows layer 8 treating you?
[6:33:45] Daggerstry: I got Mort'regar floors for floors 12-17 and it was such a pain in the ass
[6:35:07] ZackLimp: Are the floors endless or up to 18?
[6:35:23] Whasz: I don't even bother with these chests lol
[6:35:29] ZackLimp: 16 different
[6:35:32] BQAD: 18 @ZackLimp
[6:35:49] ZackLimp: Nope 2^4
[6:35:52] Aeylid: you need everything
[6:35:56] iKONZ: 2x2x2x2
[6:36:08] Aeylid: there are 16 possible combos
[6:36:11] ForgetfulOkami: possible combinations
[6:36:18] Beltaran: Which legendary are you using for this? I got the Shield of Righteous damage one, and the extra phantasma one. Not sure which will be better for corridors.
[6:36:22] bostonwinsx: hit um all twice
[6:36:41] Crocfacex: why no cam trowel
[6:36:59] ZackLimp: It's pronounced "Two to the power of two" it's math telling you that each lever can be in two positions. So the total number of different combinations are 2*2*2*2 = 16
[6:37:13] ZackLimp: "Two to the power of four"*
[6:37:46] Ordicos: doing twisted on brew atm layer 2 floor 5 got 5 stacks of Corrosive think this is done :D
[6:39:06] CDubTheRIPper: youre right, the regular torghast dungeons seem like a breeze after doing twisting LUL

[6:40:34] Revelations45: How are you tonight @Towelliee
[6:40:55] Daverion: I feel like DH don’t get anima powers that let them even come close to this damage output. Or am I wrong? I don’t have the venari torghast upgrades yet
[6:40:56] Whasz: I only play Druid, so doing this is more a passion project than a need lol

[6:41:04] Revelations45: Uncle Rev like as well
[6:41:04] Shazits: why do you complete the soul instead of releasing it?
[6:41:19] CopOut: why do DHs suck shit in torg? I see people do 60-200k dps i cant even touch that as DH
[6:41:43] Daverion: @copout same dude
[6:41:55] CDubTheRIPper: LOL
[6:41:58] Whasz: You missed a pot earlier, that was the 1 Phantasma!
[6:42:07] s4boi: open cages around broker
[6:43:03] Lawsson_Live: So far Torghast seems pretty fun in moderation, does it feel like you're forced to run it too much?
[6:44:06] ForgetfulOkami: honestly outside of this stuff for the mount it feels fine

[6:44:09] ZackLimp: I like the idea of Torghas, I just don't like that you can't exit during a run. If you had the opportunity to pause a run during a broker level or something I would love it, but having to spend multiple hours in one sitting is killing me
[6:44:14] darcnight_01: How do we get this quest?
[6:44:16] Snufflupagus_: layer 18
[6:44:23] Aeylid: layer 8 floor 18
[6:44:29] Aeylid: for the mount
[6:44:47] Puikka: yo Tow. whats your honest opinion of shadowlands so far?
[6:44:55] D3m0nHunt3r666: we still can't pause in some instances cuz of the affixes

[6:48:51] Davidkoff: Looking at how other classes play torghast makes me want to regret being rogue
[6:49:00] 2bush: I thought it was normal lol
[6:49:02] ForgetfulOkami: frostbite wand is so great in normal torghast but so bad in twisting corridors
[6:49:07] ForgetfulOkami: or well
[6:49:12] ForgetfulOkami: not bad but worthless
[6:49:17] PvtHudson093: so thats why thing were regening yesterday
[6:49:24] Shazits: pretty sure its capped at 3
[6:49:33] Rasztaban: I once picked that one witha group of 5, I waited till they reached a very low % HP to insta-kill
[6:49:44] Pallananana: frostbite wand is good for killing trash tbh
[6:49:51] beastoburden: have u had to do the boss maw of the maw on floor 18 yet?
[6:49:54] Strik3r019: @Whasz what do u mean? like i got a ilvl 200 prot pally,, u think i can do this like toweliee is?
[6:49:58] Shazits: i thought it was in a some patch notes a few weeks back
[6:50:12] Shazits: but idk im probably wrong xD
[6:50:18] Noshpan: Bless you
[6:50:40] Whasz: @Strik3r019 I don't see why not lol, earlier floors is where your base ilvl/stats matter more becausee you have less anima, but the higheer you climb and the betteer animas it makes it more comfortable
[6:50:46] sir_vanillin: discard corona plz SeemsGood
[6:50:54] swampt1l: How’s layer 8 so far?
[6:51:15] beastoburden: have u had to do the boss maw of the maw on floor 18 yet?

[6:51:37] Geographic3rd: How do you get the Maw mount?
[6:51:54] FatTown: missed a key
[6:52:14] sensualmage: i have to play it so safe on my priest lol. like mind controlling big mobs and making them fight eachother. it gets crazy lol
[6:53:43] brozzy: took me a total of 14 an half hours to clear all 8 layers THANK GOD i dont have to ever go back
[6:54:10] sensualmage: the thing to spend 100 anima for a buff isnt worth it for you?

[6:55:31] beastoburden: have u had to do the boss maw of the maw on floor 18 yet?
[6:56:27] Charles_Winston: does layer 1 to layer 2 increase a lot in difficulty?
[6:56:35] Daggerstry: I doubt Blizz would nerf it, because their excuse is you could group
[6:56:37] Aeylid: lmao
[6:56:44] Aeylid: "months"
[6:56:55] Clicklesly: I mean, Torg went through a lot of buffs and nerfs recently ^^
[6:57:08] Tigerklaue: some bosses are a joke and do nothing, while other one shot you
[6:57:20] Aeylid: @Towelliee once you get the mount need to get a group of 40 together and fucking rampage through the maw
[6:57:26] Aeylid: 40 peeps on the mount
[6:57:26] Clicklesly: If we had that acutal prenerf from a few weeks ago it might take a lot longer ^^

[7:55:17] robpwnedyou: do you have to do it all in 1 session?
[7:55:17] ZackLimp: @YaeroxTV honestly you could do it as shadow if you get the Fade one, which creates an illusion
[7:55:24] swampt1l: would i struggle on my 199 item lv mage? @Aeylid
[7:55:24] Aeylid: layers 1-5 is you can probably do in 45 minutes each
