[0:26:39] Djalextv98: even tho we sucked cock
[0:26:45] Fireclipz: tbc p1 was a draaaaggg
[0:26:47] rogueuruguayo: the only thing i hated abaout tbc was ssc/tk trash
[0:26:52] rogueuruguayo: that was horrible
[0:26:52] Simenken: TBC had a doomer type hype in Classic, since ppl were cooming over lock and hunter being the ONLY DPS and every1 else should play support to support them
[0:26:57] Simenken: OH HOW THE TABLES TURNED
[0:27:10] Fireclipz: i hate tk trash
[0:27:12] rogueuruguayo: tk mostly

[0:29:32] LaRevelations: I definitely did them like non stop. Think in vanilla my guild got every world boss kill for like a few months straight.

[0:36:58] kaspaismcspaiss: @SalvDali relating to the molten core change coming in future sod, which raid format do you prefer 20/25 or 40 man?
[0:37:13] belemrys: right before holidays
[0:37:15] belemrys: ya
[0:37:16] Fireclipz: nax on christmas and shadowlands came out
[0:37:18] weskpga: ONSLAUGHT is kinda crushing SoD now lol. They have like the top 5 speed run times
[0:37:19] Fireclipz: YEP
[0:37:22] Midiosa: I was in a super shitty guild going into AQ and then joined a sweaty guild towards the end so I only got like three weeks of good runs before naxx
[0:37:23] belemrys: naxx destroyed rampage
[0:37:32] Fireclipz: worst timing
[0:37:39] Fireclipz: nax shouldve came out in early feb
[0:37:40] Fallacy_o7: drippy leaving to run naxx on the alliance guild instead of us first run killed rampage
[0:37:46] belemrys: yep
[0:37:47] Balruk_: Shadow lands was delayed though
[0:38:15] belemrys: @Fallacy_o7 a lot of that I think had to do with how we didn't get AQ optimized and a good run like we did in BWL
[0:38:28] Suinchi: we need to lobby for re-enactment of the scourge invasion once a year on the anniversary.
[0:38:54] Balruk_: Tru ya
[0:39:02] Fireclipz: aq underrated over hated
[0:39:16] saadoddy: music slaps in AQ
[0:39:26] LaRevelations: If mindslayers didnt exist people would have loved aq universally
[0:39:29] Fireclipz: aq just sucks as ally in a dad guild
[0:39:38] Fireclipz: cuz you cant kill visc KEKL
[0:39:39] auroris9: I liked AQ cause mage finally started popping off
[0:39:41] Midiosa: I just loved every raid in classic.  It's the one expansion I wanted to do every raid every week

[0:39:53] Suinchi: as a MT the twin Emps fight is my favorite in ERA
[0:40:23] Fireclipz: i love post emps trash
[0:40:24] belemrys: yeah I enjoyed BWL and AQ speed running...never got to do naxx at sub hour pace...no sapph with polarity or stables giga
[0:40:30] Fireclipz: soo much cleave
[0:40:43] Ishkandir: sir i believe you mean cleave your balls off
[0:40:44] Fallacy_o7: didn't enjoy aq as a healer personally. but didn't hate it
[0:40:49] belemrys: and once I was in 6th in the world molten core run on invictus before DMF phase
[0:40:58] belemrys: @Fallacy_o7 chugg more green pots
[0:41:12] weskpga: Fishing for the right AQ trash ID was cancer though
[0:41:17] belemrys: and drop my tremor totems fal!
[0:41:42] Fallacy_o7: lol you know you never had to worry if i was your shaman. twistgodx
[0:41:43] Midiosa: one of my fondest memories of AQ is our warrior Yungnibba getting banned for his name as we were running into C'thun
[0:41:56] belemrys: @Fallacy_o7 twwwwwistgasm
[0:42:28] kaspaismcspaiss: my guild had problems with the post twins trash even in p6 and i personaly started using shadow resist gear there
[0:42:34] cutaway1: Havenâ€™t really followed era at allâ€¦what do ppl do now? Full-bis speed runs? Parsing? Who actually wants to heal in era instead of pumping on a fury warr?
[0:42:49] Fallacy_o7: just a lot more happening when you are trying to go fast. bwl just way easier
[0:42:50] belemrys: AQ can't drink walk as a healer
[0:42:57] belemrys: mounting
[0:43:00] belemrys: cancer for healers
[0:43:10] saadoddy: do u guys bother doing runs without DMF?
[0:43:27] Ishkandir: if they didnt wanna get cleaved they shouldnt have gotten mind controlled
[0:44:08] belemrys: did so many green dragons smh
[0:44:14] belemrys: for NR tank set
[0:44:21] weskpga: Is FSP doing any strats that were theorycrafted after Naxx ended like the DK wing gigapull or Abom gigapull?

[0:45:24] jlegretta: how hard is it to find a replacement for a speedrun guild if someone decides to stop playing? i assume there's plenty of people playing era, but speedrunning is more niche

[0:46:29] cutaway1: I had high hopes for SoD but 20-man MC kinda tipped Blizzardâ€™s hand. Feels like retail minus now
[0:46:31] Biggie6242: tank should have pretaunted
[0:46:33] Biggie6242: blame the tank
[0:46:34] belemrys: ugh just noticed I lost points for my topping 2 boss fights in BWL
[0:46:42] Suinchi: got my GOA on my warrior I donâ€™t have to go to MC BWL and AQ40 but I still do for the fun of it
[0:46:43] belemrys: you lost world buffs huh
[0:47:03] aSteamedTomato: turns out good games stay good
[0:47:05] aSteamedTomato: eh?
[0:47:19] Midiosa: streamer, what is your opinion on warriors who zug too hard and pull threat and wipe the raid?
[0:47:40] IRiblenI: is the shaman deep resto for extra dps?
[0:47:47] aSteamedTomato: dunno, sounds like a good idea to me
[0:47:49] cloudstrife543: it is exactly retail minus
[0:47:53] cloudstrife543: EXACTLY
[0:48:08] aSteamedTomato: it's a funny mix
[0:48:16] cloudstrife543: its like they are recreating retail again
[0:48:24] cloudstrife543: bit by bit
[0:48:29] Suinchi: SoD is vanilla for retail turds
[0:48:33] cloudstrife543: the same progression
[0:48:35] aSteamedTomato: stepping up to 40-man a little slower is a good idea in my opinion
[0:48:42] Fireclipz: i dont mind sod but i fucking hate gnomergoon
[0:48:49] Suinchi: SoD is super toxic with retail attitudes now
[0:48:56] cutaway1: The casual player base doesnâ€™t know their ass from their elbow when it comes to creating a good game with longevity
[0:49:40] aSteamedTomato: it exists specifically for people who just want a light take on it, kind of. Other alternatives exist
[0:49:40] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[0:49:40] cloudstrife543: stop with your logic
[0:49:40] Fireclipz: fresh wen
[0:49:51] jlegretta: changes i like = good, changes i dont like = retail reeee
[0:49:52] Suinchi: the fact that people charge gold to accept your class to raid is such a retail move. you will never see that in ERA
[0:49:58] cutaway1: We kinda need vanilla fresh though
[0:50:12] aSteamedTomato: @Suinchi I haven't seen that happen yet, but I think that's a streamer realm thing
[0:50:44] Suinchi: I have a char on Lone Wolf. Iâ€™ll see it in chat
[0:51:01] belemrys: people just want to pump and make friends...not enough people to be toxic
[0:51:04] Ranzorx: arcane crystals 400g somehow, might be my turn to get into jump runs lol
[0:51:05] belemrys: you will get run out of town
[0:51:11] aSteamedTomato: oof, glad I'm on horde side Wild Growth. Smaller realm, less rampant gigaserver tendencies
[0:51:13] belemrys: happened to a few people in NA
[0:51:14] xznips: i hate changes
[0:51:31] Ranzorx: what % of the profit is from herbs/disenchanting here?
[0:51:41] MaulerX: It does make me sad WoW does ZERO hand holding. As someone who played WoW for the first time during classic, it was a huge learning curve.
[0:51:52] hep95: never saw that in sod or retail lol
[0:52:00] aSteamedTomato: the bigger the megaserver, the more outliers you'll witness
[0:52:14] aSteamedTomato: the larger the pool of players, the more a few outliers can get away with
[0:52:18] Ranzorx: I mean I just saw a video of Ziqo not getting invited to a gnomer pug on his alt KEKW
[0:52:22] jlegretta: nobody that plays era wants to raid on boomkin or ret pally so that problem doesnt exist xd
[0:52:28] kaspaismcspaiss: @SalvDali btw do meme specs make it in to normal pugs/gdkp runs in era, in your expierience/
[0:52:29] Mutiup: isn't current era exactly what people wanted before blizzard announced classic?
[0:52:30] kaspaismcspaiss: ?

[0:54:53] Balruk_: Meme specs come to my runs
[0:55:04] aSteamedTomato: @Mutiup I think there's a lot of people who want fresh on repeat, mostly because continuous inflation can feel hopeless when the quality of raid groups starts getting stratified by wealth
[0:55:06] Midew: if ur wallet is big enough you can be a chicken
[0:55:11] Balruk_: If you got the gold ya lok
[0:55:46] Ranzorx: big problem in sod is when the meme specs arent a meme, no one wants to play healer lol
[0:56:12] coastalhappiness: Are ele shamans good in classic ?
[0:56:17] aSteamedTomato: sod kind of moves back and forth who's a meme spec and who isn't
[0:56:32] LaRevelations: Yeah whitemane era has a ret paladin that has gdkp'd his way to 100% bis. Its pretty funny when you see it.
[0:56:34] Fireclipz: idk if you answered it earlier but how much does a weekly nax cost for consumes ?
[0:56:46] aSteamedTomato: and people who don't like rerolling get shut out because a lot of people expect everyone to play flavor of the month at every turn
[0:56:58] Ranzorx: havent seen a boomkin but I have seen an ele shaman who can pump
[0:57:45] aSteamedTomato: the constant re-balancing makes it so that people can't really predict whether or not they'll be useful
[0:58:39] weskpga: People have a hard time differentiating between the inflationary effects of Blizzard not cracking down on bots and GDKP's unfortunately
[0:58:57] westbrooklive: killed that boss like ebonroc
[0:59:20] aSteamedTomato: I mean, based on how high the gold prices have climbed and how frequently swipers get banned now, it seems like they knew what they were doing going into P2 tho
[0:59:39] belemrys: they like replacing gear every patch

[0:59:44] aSteamedTomato: there's probably truth to GDKPs being an issue in terms of detecting RMT transactions

[1:04:08] SipDatLean: i would rather be playing a fresh classic, but SoD got all my friends to resub and play so i am happy to be playing some version of classic with the boys
[1:04:33] LaRevelations: I mean even with the current expansions of classic coming out. Even if you don't enjoy the games its still cool that people who didnt do the expansions back in the day are getting to try, or those who did can get a re-do

[4:46:50] axe5038: what are you thinking pay out wise?
[4:47:09] jlegretta: damn people pay almost the same for binding and goa
[4:47:09] Niksen_99: Is onslaught one of those items u use all through vanilla ?
[4:47:23] axe5038: yes
[4:47:48] sacredpotat0: What did GoA go for?
[4:47:56] R_GraM_: girdle of mentor better but osg good enough
[4:47:56] bacconader: @Niksen_99 You can, the next better item is girdle of the mentor which is not that much better
[4:47:57] jlegretta: the binding, that's a ton of gold for just half a weapon
[4:48:13] saadaanse: does demo shout reduce your rage gain?
[4:48:57] gressil1234: how much did binding sell?
[4:49:05] Dhars: Dali I've said this times and times over. No homo, but I'd smash.
[4:49:09] Dhars: You handsome devil Kreygasm
[4:49:37] gressil1234: super cheap, bindings go +200k usually

[4:51:21] rydogsan24: these prices are so cooked
[4:51:30] brooch_fan: 50k or we'll never financially recover
[4:51:48] bacconader: That was down to his lat copper
[4:52:05] xznips: ngl there is only people that say "on my server its 300k" or "those prices are so high" KEKW
[4:52:23] Midew: no please i can still mail 13 silver from my bank alt
[4:52:56] rydogsan24: you going to do hc ssf?
[4:53:04] Grabfate: is your long term goal with gdkps to buy GOA or just fund raid consumes?
[4:53:08] bacconader: Maaaan ive been sitting in org for the better part of the day waiting for a nef
[4:53:17] R_GraM_: respectable
[4:53:22] brooch_fan: TrollDespair i've been waiting for a head drop all morning
[4:53:59] bacconader: Isnt that what DalvSali will be for?
[4:54:16] R_GraM_: !alts
[4:54:16] Nightbot: Dalvsali and Pilla are Dali's newest alts on Classic Era. The plan is to ultimately use the warrior as a GDKP alt. The Paladin solely exists to healbot the warrior, no plans to raid on it.

[4:55:25] HeliosCirce: easy npc reset
[4:55:30] bacconader: Clueless my how didnt I think of that
[4:55:30] Jugswon1: maybe hordes should sneak into stormwind to grab some dragonslayer buffs like us alliance players have to do for rend
[4:55:56] rogueclassic: how much did the binding go for in the end?
[4:56:07] R_GraM_: 80k
[4:57:05] saadaanse: if there will be classic fresh will u be leveling warrior like tryhard fast?
[4:57:28] swedishviking345: naxx gdkps pay much more
[4:57:42] brooch_fan: !onmyserver 13k last night
[4:57:42] Nightbot: NO ONE CARES
[4:57:57] R_GraM_: the inflation is bad but just do some gdkps n itâ€™ll come around
[4:58:48] LaRevelations: Being able to do jump runs immediately (albeit difficult with pre bis) would be kinda nuts for setting yourself up early
[4:58:48] brooch_fan: next step mage on a 3rd account?
[4:59:10] bacconader: I wonder how they would pace a fresh server, like how long the phases would last
[4:59:39] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[4:59:55] R_GraM_: I liked the length of classic like two years right? AQ phase cud have been a lil longer
[5:00:18] weskpga: Thank god cause if they released a vanilla fresh server again it would ruin my life
[5:00:24] rogueclassic: with sod out and them looking towards classic+ if they release a no changes fresh i'd assume it would be same length and cadence as classic was
[5:00:24] bacconader: Im now at the point with my gear where I can solo BRD Arena, im now a total of 125 runs in and no sgc
[5:00:53] thayorn: how hard is it to get into a guild looking to get back into era havent played since origional classic.
[5:01:01] thayorn: is it worth the investment to start again lol
[5:01:15] Whitty: people are always recruiting, depends on the server though
[5:01:51] xznips: all types of guilds are always taking new guys, TBH tho the most pugs have higher quality then the "average" guild
[5:01:52] gressil1234: got my savage gladiator while leveling back in classic lmao
[5:02:07] MalosAren: I didn't clone any of my characters. Can't put myself to start from scratch
[5:02:24] R_GraM_: !grateful
[5:02:24] Nightbot: For a guy who mainswapped less than a week ago you arent very grateful lol
[5:02:46] R_GraM_: just join a speedrunning guild and get all loot for free 4Head
[5:03:09] Riceandbeans01: I xfered a hardcore character to whitemane, level 35 rn
[5:03:19] HeliosCirce: Im glad I got mine cloned, did it when they cut the price to at the very least have a kind of time capsule
[5:03:24] iamgabe69: tons of jump runs
[5:03:25] Gatoradeshame: @SalvDali did you not clone your characters when that was an option? If not, how come?
[5:03:30] MalosAren: Atiesh in the garbage, mouth blade in the abyss, nearly full bis priest.
[5:03:37] MalosAren: 8 60s in the toilet lol
[5:04:15] Shartsquatch: the race in SoD has turned me off it
[5:04:21] Shartsquatch: always rushing
[5:04:22] R_GraM_: so thankful I have my OG warr
[5:04:29] 1Haiden: do you think era will fizzle out soon or is the community strong?
[5:04:38] R_GraM_: miss not having my mage n sham to soak gdkps
[5:04:44] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[5:04:44] Gatoradeshame: @SalvDali follow up question then, why not play NA at all?
[5:05:05] Jugswon1: SoD couldnt kill era so..
[5:05:06] weskpga: Only reason era would fizzle is if they launch new vanilla fresh
[5:05:07] bacconader: If it didnt fizzle out over SoD then I dont see a reason it fizzling out any time soon
[5:05:22] bacconader: Unless.. F R E S H
[5:05:24] monbe123: U CANT SEE IN FUTURE? MAN THAT MUST SUCKS
[5:05:25] gressil1234: people came to era because they couldn't clear ulduar
[5:05:27] R_GraM_: @malosaren rip bro happened to a lot of ppl
[5:05:30] noochlol: FRESH??
[5:05:48] roflmaster5: do u know of any player thats raided classic through to classic era this whole time
[5:05:56] MalosAren: Until us boomers pass on, vanilla will live
[5:06:11] deathtoall89: Id like to see a seasonal 2 year vanilla server with toons going to era at end each cycle
[5:06:29] xznips: @roflmaster5 YES ME
[5:06:29] roflmaster5: yeh
[5:06:32] Midiosa: was your viewer count higher in wrath or is it higher now that you are back in era?
[5:06:33] R_GraM_: more and more ppl slowly coming back to era
[5:06:36] xznips: i stopped 4 months
[5:06:38] sconcedream: Harikari in FP has been doing that
[5:06:44] Edwardo_Newgate: don't worry guys CATACLYSM is gonna be peak wow gamplay kekw
[5:06:45] MalosAren: @r_gram_  tragedy
[5:06:47] rogueclassic: @xznips fraud Sadge
[5:06:52] roflmaster5: @xznips damnn how many naxx lockouts? lol
[5:07:04] HeliosCirce: @Edwardo_Newgate better get your colossus smash ready
[5:07:15] xznips: @roflmaster5 actually very little, was on a shit server first that couldnt clear naxx for close to 1 year
[5:07:28] xznips: but combined i guess.... 200?
[5:07:29] Trix_x: !na
[5:07:29] Nightbot: Dali still plans on raiding full-time on his NA mage and warrior. The mage will continue pumping in Insidious. Still undecided on what guild for the warrior. KKona
[5:07:43] roflmaster5: @xznips damnn
[5:07:44] sacredpotat0: Has any of SoD's new over-zealous RMT detection nuked era GDKPs?
[5:07:44] Edwardo_Newgate: @HeliosCirce gonna colossus smash into touching grass instead of wow
[5:07:46] HeliosCirce: Im uh, sorry about that
[5:07:54] 1Haiden: what did you go before streaming?
[5:07:56] xznips: @roflmaster5 got a lot fo characters tho
[5:08:04] Krumbull: Shadowstrike was my first epic back in 2005, was so happy to get it as a kid while the rest of the raid made fun of me
[5:08:58] northxwest: TRUCKER DALI KKONA
[5:09:28] iamgabe69: KKona
[5:09:41] monbe123: Where you a part of the freedom caravan in Canada? @SalvDali
[5:09:46] LaRevelations: Logistics can be fun. I do that now and work from home. It's incredibly nice to make a good living literally never having to deal with people in person
[5:09:50] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[5:10:18] bacconader: I feel like working from home made a lot of jobs much more bearable
[5:10:29] R_GraM_: wfh bis
[5:10:37] bacconader: Im doing IT-support on the side now, but I could never do that if I had to go to into an office
[5:10:38] R_GraM_: of u can swing it
[5:11:06] monbe123: is cutthroat like a pirate cutthroat?
[5:11:15] LaRevelations: I work in logistics on the opposite end. I work for a company paying trucking companies pick up stuff for me. Its a lot more comfy on this side.
[5:11:47] nobodygotfarm: how f'd is economy on era? how  much DME farming for a flask for instance?
[5:11:57] sacredpotat0: I left my last job for a similar reason. Felt bad trying to scam clients I knew well to try to grow the razor thin margins.
[5:12:00] nobodygotfarm: or w/e farms are worth it
[5:12:13] cloudbells: @nobodygotfarm gotten a LOT better lately, but not ideal
[5:12:32] Rycyn: dme runs are still pretty nice. You can get a lot of herbs and if you are a caster the demonic runes are nice
[5:12:35] R_GraM_: gdkps best gold farm
[5:12:44] LaRevelations: Nah I work for a company that sells specific products to every day use type of places. We have contracts with suppliers to pick up their stuff and take it to final direction. We hire 3PL type companies to handle the actual driving. What I do is mostly the planning of how to move things within our network to get to final destination properly.
[5:13:06] dreamglowdk: Are we gonna pretend everyone doesn't just buy gold? KEKL
[5:13:15] MaulerX: Since you mentioned your old job and you went to stream to find something better. Do you have an opinion on the whole being a streamer is harder than working a normal job?
[5:14:06] kkush2: checked the site earlier, 100k on era is like 450 euro lol
[5:14:15] bgod2500: most people most certainly do in classic xD
[5:14:32] dreamglowdk: over 50% of the playerbase has or does buy gold
[5:14:34] dreamglowdk: KEKL
[5:14:39] R_GraM_: never bought gold either not worth the risk after all the time and effort Iâ€™ve put in to get potentially banned
[5:14:43] bgod2500: oh not everyone buys gold, but a big portion do

[5:15:04] Jugswon1: 41% of all statistics are made up
[5:15:05] deathtoall89: Its probably 5%
[5:15:16] kkush2: @Jugswon1 kekW
[5:15:16] sacredpotat0: If everyone doesnt buy gold, then that means I am the only person doing it which means its not okay. But I am a good person, that cant be true. Copium
[5:15:22] Trix_x: does anyone have a NA era gdkp discord? Cant find much on google
[5:15:22] flawless_jv: Source: trust me bro
[5:15:26] Rycyn: i've never purchased gold before and i sit around 20k consistently. Just running gdkps and doing dme runs you can make gold easily
[5:15:38] bgod2500: I dont care about buying gold tbh, I dont do GDKP's therefor it doesnt affect me
[5:15:38] xznips: i dont get the whole "i raidlog and buy gold meta"

[5:15:55] monbe123: why is DME so lucrative?
[5:16:06] Rycyn: herbs for people crafting pots
[5:16:43] deathtoall89: Thunderys eat a ton of arcanite
[5:16:45] Ranzorx: https://discord.gg/t5C94XyFpf @Trix_x wouldn't let me dm it
[5:16:50] NostalgicDream: and its uncontested for pvp servers

[5:17:30] sacredpotat0: Juicy
[5:17:35] bacconader: @nobodygotfarm no, r14 is like 8-9weeks now
[5:17:36] Ranzorx: been getting like 3k from aq's but I guess they have been pumper runs
[5:17:38] bacconader: and its way easier

[5:17:59] Ranzorx: ahh damn dream runs then
