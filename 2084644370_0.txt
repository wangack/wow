[0:18:58] RosieSeren: good afternoon
[0:19:29] Pathstrider: good afternoon
[0:19:34] NeeK_23: I wonder if people can keep their characters in wrath or if theyre forced into cata old world changes. Alot of the classic appeal was seeing the world before cata changed it. Will classic era servers pick up again?
[0:19:36] Puhg: hi hi
[0:19:42] Puhg: Wish I could stop coughing.
[0:19:42] pennzach: pennzchry subscribed with Prime. 
[0:20:17] RosieSeren: I'm not interested in classic cata but have to admit the artwork they've made for it is really good

[0:22:13] ratgefingah: was this like the beginning of modern wow?
[0:22:19] Keltix: I'm surprised they haven't added the dungeon journal yet, or is it there?
[0:22:24] keyboardturner: I didn't see any textures at all in game data
[0:23:20] Thoreya: focus is back pog
[0:23:28] Keltix: Try /run if not EncounterJournal then EncounterJournal_LoadUI() end ToggleFrame(EncounterJournal)
[0:23:32] Thoreya: lol
[0:23:33] volkreig: Hey Dan and chat, how we all doing?
[0:23:46] Keltix: Just a regular script I guess
[0:24:18] Keltix: Would be weird if they enable transmogs on launch and not the dungeon journal that came out a whole patch before
[0:24:54] mikeygames: do /who and see how many are on
[0:25:00] ratgefingah: lvl 2 already? leveling is way too fast Kappa
[0:25:02] NeeK_23: was cata when ammo was removed?
[0:25:11] Wextak: LuL
[0:25:30] mikeygames: do them on retail and just pretend you're on beta
[0:25:38] chelfx: I feel like he d
[0:25:46] Keltix: Yeah pets were dumbed down in Cata
[0:25:49] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah the whole pet system was removed in cata
[0:25:54] keyboardturner: wasn't there a heatmap quest tracking on map at this point
[0:26:22] keyboardturner: where is it then
[0:26:23] volkreig: I love levelling through cata zones so really looking forward to cata classic
[0:27:00] keyboardturner: cata kind of defeats the point imo
[0:27:05] murloc_kingkiller: what‚Äôs the new graphics option in this beta?
[0:27:09] Keltix: Assist is like WoD I think
[0:27:16] volkreig: tbh I started in cata but didn‚Äôt really get into wow fully until legion
[0:27:26] mikeygames: No
[0:27:32] Harai_Ulfsark: also no, no weapon skills in cata
[0:27:39] RAF_Sean: Morning legend
[0:27:44] keyboardturner: no there wasn't because we had training dummies
[0:27:44] Harai_Ulfsark: so its just wrath+
[0:27:51] obaggz: Cata was the start of the wow we have today
[0:28:05] Rokir_: I feel like at this point Classic has just become a way for them to rewrite WoWs history the way they want it to be viewed. Could see them cleaning up MoP and adding in the forgotten WoD Raid Tier
[0:28:14] BigPapaGrizz: from what ive been seeing across streams, it seems everyone has forgotten a lot about cata. The biggest thing being that talent trees haven't fully changed yet.
[0:28:16] mikeygames: considering they had cata beta all those years ago you'd think the one you'd playing would just 'work' ha
[0:28:24] RAF_Sean: Do you have a short out showing the differences in the enhanced graphics and og graphics settings?
[0:28:34] keyboardturner: if anything SoD is doing something closer to that
[0:28:43] RAF_Sean: Curious to see the difference but kinda too lazy to google it l><
[0:29:03] RAF_Sean: <3
[0:29:04] Keltix: @Rokir_ If thats the case....WHERE'S THE DANCE STUDIO BLIZZARD!
[0:29:09] RAF_Sean: The hero we need
[0:29:54] fetza108: @Keltix it is the same yet or no?
[0:30:01] RAF_Sean: Hmm yes, I can definitely see a difference >.>
[0:30:07] fetza108: @fetza108 oh not to you sorry :D
[0:30:14] RAF_Sean: Ok cool. I'll wait
[0:30:20] bullymikko: Do u have vrs on?
[0:30:25] fetza108: is there?
[0:30:29] Harai_Ulfsark: they're the same picture
[0:30:30] RAF_Sean: No that was meant to be suspicous tone
[0:30:43] longdice: Maybe you need to reset client ?
[0:30:52] fetza108: it isnt working yet i think
[0:31:04] bullymikko: Might work better with not so new graphic card
[0:31:20] longdice: But yeah, wouldnt be suprised if it didnt work yet
[0:31:26] Harai_Ulfsark: cata loading screen was so good
[0:31:26] darkol33t: @MrGM how can we be beta tester?
[0:31:36] Harai_Ulfsark: the one we have now.. not so much
[0:31:50] RAF_Sean: !beta
[0:31:51] fetza108: i think it is the same :D

[0:32:59] mikeygames: they'll probably invite more people to the closed beta in a few days whent hey realise there's 2 people online at the min hah
[0:33:33] BigPapaGrizz: doin good! been spending a lot of time out of state at my gf's house getting ready for a big move later this year
[0:33:39] BananaBaby29: at least no server queues
[0:33:59] bullymikko: Is the AH same as in retail?
[0:34:13] MediumRareOG: only 2 people and you're probably on different layers
[0:34:16] fetza108: @bullymikko yes
[0:34:19] BigPapaGrizz: i think as more beta gets rolled out people are gonna see why cata was actually a top 3 xpack.
[0:34:28] darkol33t: @MrGM write that maybe then make it PTR
[0:34:30] darkol33t: public
[0:34:54] ratgefingah: I kinda hope 10.2.6 is the vampire survivors mode. I need content
[0:35:24] fetza108: @fetza108 oh i mean the ah menu and options are not but the appearance is yes
[0:35:41] BananaBaby29: can we start a dk in beta or do you need a level 60?
[0:35:44] mikeygames: 10.2.6 will probably be a raiding gauntlet of every raid boss ever, at least that's what I reckon if Max knows
[0:36:06] ratgefingah: wut
[0:36:19] Layliah79: Cata was my first midnight release wow expansion. I remember being at Gamestop for the pre-release party. Man that seems like forever ago.
[0:36:21] ratgefingah: whats a raiding gauntlet posed to be
[0:36:47] Voldreka: @MrGM What exactly are you testing? Isn't Cata like still in Retail basically?
[0:37:31] keyboardturner: Kapp what if they combined MoP and Cata
[0:37:34] Layliah79: bugs can happen
[0:37:37] Rokir_: I do wonder what they mean by "faster content cadence" for Cata. Makes me thing this'll only be around for a year or so
[0:38:00] Dirtnose: Merging old codebases into new clients causes a tonne of merge errors. It's a lot more work than it seems on the surface
[0:38:08] NeeK_23: this is Pandaria Timerunning, youre running back to Cata LuL
[0:38:09] Harai_Ulfsark: and we still had the ranged weapon slot
[0:38:27] Harai_Ulfsark: pandaria
[0:38:34] yuldovah42: that was mop
[0:38:51] illidari_Neeko: I see Cata bata is as buggy as ever üòÇ
[0:39:00] BananaBaby29: firelands was soo good
[0:39:15] Redtuzk: Dan! The hunter discord has important quest for you. You need to get to level 29, spec into Lock & Load, and see if you can chain 3 Explosive Shots without any of the ticks clipping.
[0:39:23] Voldreka: Gotcha. Definitely sounds like it should be a more open beta then.
[0:39:56] Redtuzk: I believe in you
[0:40:30] Voldreka: As soon as I said what can you test, you find a bug! xD
[0:41:40] l3k13: now that's a fire axe LUL
[0:41:46] NeeK_23: holding the axe like a rifle lol
[0:41:50] Forgiven78: can you drop it and then reaquire and complete?

[0:45:15] nuclearphosphate: ^ thoughjt that
[0:45:33] Rokir_: When they said Closed Beta I guess they meant *really really closed*
[0:45:46] nuclearphosphate: so in other words its got a LOT more to go before its safe for launch?
[0:45:54] Chesscape: LUL  So why do they need a beta? Everything looks to be working perfectly
[0:46:00] Redtuzk: The state of this beta has me worried ngl üò¨ Closed beta to wotlk launch was 3 months, and wotlk beta came out in a way more finished state
[0:47:00] nuclearphosphate: i miss my private server
[0:47:28] darkol33t: warmen MOP <3
[0:47:29] Redtuzk: What does it do?
[0:47:29] nuclearphosphate: what kinda addon is it
[0:48:28] nuclearphosphate: installed adapt
[0:48:31] BananaBaby29: i wish we could get a quest read addon in retail it would actually make me care about questing
[0:48:53] nuclearphosphate: @BananaBaby29 "immersion" is fantastic
[0:49:01] nuclearphosphate: thats the addon i use for quests
[0:49:16] nuclearphosphate: chad
[0:49:21] Voldreka: Goodboy
[0:49:26] BananaBaby29: wolfmcwolfface
[0:49:42] nuclearphosphate: yeah the pet died
[0:50:23] Voldreka: Is Cata when character models were updated?
[0:50:33] Pilums: no that was WoD
[0:50:43] Austin6192: No that was WoD
[0:51:00] nuclearphosphate: thats new
[0:51:08] Rokir_: AINTNOWAY
[0:51:12] NeeK_23: deathwing still sleeping I guess
[0:51:16] nuclearphosphate: ^
[0:51:19] BananaBaby29: isnt this pre patch beta?
[0:51:19] big_hot_ape: deathwing forgor to destroy it xd
[0:51:46] Chesscape: wrong map?
[0:51:50] illidari_Neeko: Deathwing was busy I guess‚Ä¶üòÇ
[0:51:51] LindirTV: imagine getting beta, couldnt be me :(
[0:52:12] BananaBaby29: oh is deathwing killing people in random zones in this build?
[0:52:27] nuclearphosphate: that auction UI looks SO weird now LUL
[0:52:29] Wextak: ResidentSleeper
[0:52:43] tnhorrorfan: who is the highest one playing right now
[0:52:46] Redtuzk: When they said "updates" they meant that 1 cogwheel you pressed
[0:52:57] Voldreka: Oh I saw some destruction
[0:53:12] illidari_Neeko: Deathwing already destroyed it like been there done that!
[0:53:35] LindirTV: that place has seen better days
[0:53:55] BananaBaby29: map bug?
[0:53:55] ratgefingah: what happened to stormwind D:
[0:55:04] ratgefingah: the brokers in taza vesh look so cool
[0:55:16] Harai_Ulfsark: portal room was in bfa?
[0:55:19] nuclearphosphate: taza vesh?
[0:55:41] LindirTV: that was a pretty sweet loadscreen
[0:55:51] BananaBaby29: no worgen or goblin ?
[0:56:05] ratgefingah: @BananaBaby29 not available yet
[0:56:45] big_hot_ape: there is 3 ppl on a server and you didnt even try to name dk arthas. what a shame
[0:56:49] KaisenSiru: Cata Pog
[0:57:11] BananaBaby29: @kingbrthur goblin and worgen are the best starting zones wow has ever done
[0:57:36] nuclearphosphate: thatll be the one to go to the wine shop
[0:57:39] mrsrockguru: afternon @MrGM and chat

[1:01:52] Sindragozer: i thought so too
[1:01:59] mikeygames: it's beyond bugged clearly
[1:01:59] BananaBaby29: dont you have to be a certain level to get mail?
[1:02:04] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah hunters start with mail in cata
[1:02:08] Khinjars: Mail lvl 40 I believe
[1:02:25] Sindragozer: i wonder what the transmog system is like for this
[1:02:27] realnzall: @MrGM According to wowpedia, hunters start with Leather until Legion
[1:02:34] realnzall: They changed it in Legion
[1:02:48] Mucrush: I thought it was in Cata it started
[1:02:48] Sindragozer: since they used a more modern collection system for wotlk, hoping tmog is more modern
[1:02:57] catgay13: you have an armor type speciality i think
[1:03:02] catgay13: you learn it at 40 or something
[1:03:12] Sindragozer: yup

[1:03:26] Sindragozer: im just really hoping i can tmog my atiesh
[1:03:34] catgay13: any big changes compared to og cata?
[1:03:49] Mucrush: Oh yeah wiki does say it was Legion. Oh gosh
[1:03:49] Sindragozer: if i can, ill play it for sure
[1:04:35] Sindragozer: when did paladins and warriors armor stuff change? was that in legion too? i coulda sworn was cata
[1:04:36] Mucrush: Yeah I guess
[1:04:38] realnzall: yes

[1:05:57] nuclearphosphate: if its 1k xp per rare now im in
[1:06:08] Sindragozer: i gotta finish some achievements in wotlk before cata comes out. im super close to loremaster
[1:06:13] Mucrush: Fastest way of leveling in Classic Cata: RARE GRIND
[1:06:15] catgay13: how much is a quest?
[1:06:40] MediumRareOG: in retail rares on old world zones give a lot of xp. it makes sense it started with the cata revamp but i didn't realize the bonus was in cata
[1:06:45] catgay13: strummer beta Madge
[1:07:20] catgay13: hopefully Prayge
[1:07:25] illidari_Neeko: mrgmJAM mrgmJAM mrgmJAM

[1:08:57] Samiccus: Ya another kill another Bad Luck Protection......
[1:08:58] catgay13: its class locked sadly
[1:09:21] Rokir_: I didnt get my legendary until my 15th Heroic kill.... (Guaranteed at that point btw)
[1:09:24] catgay13: when they increased the dropchance i looted it on 2 chars back to back
[1:09:24] Rokir_: Luck is just cruel
[1:09:31] physalis4: Do you thing they'll let ppl upgrade legos in S4?
[1:09:40] Samiccus: I gotta be approaching some kind of record. Blizz has it out for me
[1:09:41] Cadance_Of_Equestria: sam is only at 8 kills though
[1:09:42] Ithylz: Having it for tmog is the important bit, who cares about the dmg gain, right?
[1:09:45] TenFatties: @physalis4 100%
[1:09:48] Cadance_Of_Equestria: so at this point he's favored to get it
[1:09:58] catgay13: i think it was like 100-150k, only crafted it on dk
[1:10:03] TenFatties: u could do that in shadowlands s4 with the lego bow
[1:10:14] BBMezzy: ilvl is temporary, transmog lasts forever
[1:10:20] NeeK_23: the whole reason I want it is to tmog my evoker
[1:10:34] Sindragozer: LUL
[1:10:43] ratgefingah: do you think we will get dracthyr on other classes in tww?
[1:10:52] catgay13: fyralath

[1:11:12] blumberquack: fear a laugh LUL
[1:11:16] Rokir_: Fear-ah-lah-th
[1:11:25] Harai_Ulfsark: fyrakk himself says it
[1:11:28] nuclearphosphate: i got it first run :D
[1:11:43] skewlbeta: More of a sword person myself.
[1:11:45] blumberquack: Survival dodged a lotta bullets in DF for that, no op bow, no legendary
[1:11:48] blumberquack: nice living B)
[1:12:02] Rokir_: Need more channel point rewards, I have a stockpile ready for some nonsense
[1:12:03] catgay13: that was so cringe, they especially said "every 2hand axe wilder..."
[1:12:07] Yuri__Sakura: hammer person here
[1:12:08] catgay13: *wilder
[1:12:30] Elrathir: I mog my leggo axe on my survival hunter :D

[1:12:50] Rokir_: @nuclearphosphate I have 240,000 lol
[1:12:55] big_hot_ape: got it 2 weeks ago and didnt do any key higher than +5 with it cuz im done with pve in this season
[1:12:56] big_hot_ape: nice leggo
[1:13:07] Ithylz: The fact that they haven't made a druid legendary is still funny to me :D
[1:13:17] nuclearphosphate: @Rokir_ O.o
[1:13:19] Harai_Ulfsark: there was a streamer i watched back then that he had to ban a few people from chat bc we found the worst color ever to have on a lamp
[1:13:34] nuclearphosphate: @Harai_Ulfsark thats just sad
[1:14:19] Harai_Ulfsark: it was a really smart lamp that allowed us to type those color codes, we just found the worst one
[1:14:19] Sindragozer: i have 194k points lol
[1:14:20] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:14:24] Mucrush: Maybe its like piss yellow?
[1:14:33] Harai_Ulfsark: something between green and yellow with bit of brown
[1:14:47] nuclearphosphate: ^ LUL
[1:14:54] blumberquack: Unpleasant gradiant of lime green and bright pink LUL
[1:15:05] Mucrush: So very much a piss yellow it seems like LUL
[1:15:06] Annathebanana1986: Good afternoon
[1:15:27] catgay13: @Harai_Ulfsark ngl i assumed something very different KEKW
[1:15:27] Suze_o_0: In the next few months, I am going to pick up some streaming, in small amounts[ probably vtuber though]
[1:15:29] KaisenSiru: Cata Pog
[1:15:32] catgay13: world scaling was end of legion
[1:15:32] Mucrush: That was late Legion
[1:15:34] blumberquack: World scaling was Legion wasn't it
[1:15:36] Harai_Ulfsark: no, scale tech came in legion
[1:15:42] catgay13: 7.3.5
[1:15:44] MediumRareOG: It'll be a nice touch in the shipping container you live in in Rishi Sunak's Britain
[1:15:45] Rokir_: Most great tech came in Legion
[1:15:47] Annathebanana1986: I'm good thanks, how are you?
[1:16:08] Sindragozer: i cant wait for Legion classic
[1:16:13] Sindragozer: its gonna be great
[1:16:13] Harai_Ulfsark: cataclysm taking a lot of credit for things that legion did LUL
[1:16:23] mrcalwell: Probably says 80-90 since you go back there for dailies and later on Molten Front stuff.
[1:16:40] MediumRareOG: i dislike zone scaling
[1:16:41] big_hot_ape: classic tww when :(
[1:16:47] Annathebanana1986: Oh my ü§§ü§§ unhealthy but sooo good
[1:16:48] nuclearphosphate: thats wrong
[1:17:11] Sindragozer: its classic in the sense that its on the classic progression server i guess lol
[1:17:21] mrcalwell: Oh yeah! Forgot that the Cata cap was 85. That's weird.
[1:17:34] Sindragozer: i missed the 1st half of legion tho, so
[1:17:43] Annathebanana1986: I'm at crufts all day tomorrow, Auroras brother and daddy got placed
[1:17:46] MediumRareOG: i'm almost getting sick of comp stomp
[1:17:46] Sindragozer: and i imagine they would have the legendary vendor in at the start

[1:18:09] RAF_Sean: @MediumRareOG How dare you
[1:18:09] volkreig: Do you think classic MoP might actually happen?
[1:18:16] Annathebanana1986: Cata was the first expansion I quit for a while
[1:18:33] Sindragozer: @volkreig since cata is happening, im expecting it all to happen
[1:18:45] RAF_Sean: Can you access tiktok from PC?
[1:18:52] Harai_Ulfsark: classic legion, where artifact power you collect is applied to all your artifacts equally
[1:19:12] Suze_o_0: @RAF_Sean why not? LOL! Morning Sean
[1:19:18] Wrathbb1: I would pay 30 bucks a month for MoP classic
[1:19:26] nuclearphosphate: @Annathebanana1986 for me it was MoP
[1:19:44] Eyu_wow: Cata and Mop are not rly classic anymore imo
[1:19:45] nuclearphosphate: @Wrathbb1 the sub prices are already extortionate as i tis
[1:19:49] Eyu_wow: was Vanilla-Wotlk :(
[1:19:56] Harai_Ulfsark: cata was when i really expanded my alts, from only druid and hunter (night elves) to all the worgen i have today, one from each class except priest and mage
[1:20:06] LuiBMHunter: You were playing Cata last night - without us - I saw you!
[1:20:07] Annathebanana1986: @nuclearphosphate why did you quit in mop?
[1:20:23] Minobard: MOP a Realm Reborn lol
[1:20:25] Wrathbb1: in two years Legion will be 10 years old
[1:20:29] Annathebanana1986: Stalker! LUL
[1:20:30] Wrathbb1: thats pretty classic
[1:20:34] big_hot_ape: wait, do they keep wotlk or it will be gone
[1:20:35] nuclearphosphate: @Annathebanana1986 i cant stand that expansion, Hate pandaland
[1:20:39] LuiBMHunter: say your login and out message on toweliee's chat :)
[1:20:58] Lausten: At this rate we will have classic dragonflight half a year after TWW releases..
[1:21:01] nuclearphosphate: @Annathebanana1986 i deliberately skip pandaria, legion and WotLK expansions when levelling
[1:21:02] Annathebanana1986: Oh nooo @nuclearphosphate I loved mop
[1:21:06] Cadance_Of_Equestria: so since they are releasing cata classic, are y'all ready for MoP classic when we will see world's first Wrathguard Corrupted Ashbringer Warlock?
[1:21:06] theszoti: is this ui in the game by default?
[1:21:40] Annathebanana1986: U don't like any of those exp @nuclearphosphate? üò≠

[1:22:33] Annathebanana1986: Sadge @nuclearphosphate mop and legion were my fave <3
[1:22:38] Harai_Ulfsark: its a candle
[1:22:57] Sindragozer: ya lol i triod it with a couple friends, i didnt take it away from any melee that could actually use it
[1:23:03] Lausten: @Harai_Ulfsark You no take candle!
[1:23:36] Lausten: Still no aoe loot in cata?
[1:23:39] Lausten: When did we get that?
[1:24:02] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah but aoe loot is so good it should be everywhere
[1:24:21] Wrathbb1: yeah mop
[1:24:38] Lausten: Those qol features should be optional in any of the versions of the game imo, there is just no point in not having it
[1:24:45] Sindragozer: ya they have the 60 and 80 in wrath
[1:24:58] Sindragozer: for ony
[1:25:19] Lausten: If you dont want it you could just toggle it off, its not like its breaking anyones game if I aoe loot and they dont?
[1:25:26] big_hot_ape: chapters was in legion i believe
[1:25:38] LuiBMHunter: when did combined bag become an option?
[1:25:47] Annathebanana1986: So what was the best thing about cata? My memory is so bad
[1:25:47] Thoreya: lvling seems super fast in cata
[1:25:55] LuiBMHunter: wow
[1:26:00] big_hot_ape: before legion lore master achievents was just "do x quests"
[1:26:13] big_hot_ape: or even bfa idk
[1:26:14] nuclearphosphate: @Thoreya just wait, they'll nerf it to the ground LUL
[1:26:22] fooxytv: do you get a pet at level 1?
[1:26:31] Lausten: What? searchable options? Blasphemy Kappa
[1:26:58] meroxzx: what spec u go for?
[1:27:19] LuiBMHunter: best expac ever - removed ammo!
[1:27:23] Thoreya: @nuclearphosphate nah idts, they even still have the wrath xp buff
[1:27:37] KaisenSiru: Cata was just amazing
[1:28:03] Lausten: Its the beginning of "phase 2" of wow imo
[1:28:04] MediumRareOG: i don't believe anyone is actually nostalgiac about cata
[1:28:07] Thoreya: i quit in cata, but heard pvp was the best in cata, so im prob gonna play it a bit and see
[1:28:15] volkreig: same got to wrath 80 and I was done
[1:28:37] Annathebanana1986: All I remember is deathwing setting zones on fire and killing us
[1:28:43] nuclearphosphate: it goes down quicker than that in retail
[1:29:54] nuclearphosphate: thats one thing i NEVEr bother with, keybindings
[1:30:25] nuclearphosphate: like i just press the number keys and use my mouse for everything
[1:30:28] LuiBMHunter: you click your spells out of the spellbook?
[1:30:37] catgay13: cant you copy account settings like on ptr
[1:30:51] MediumRareOG: I didn't realize Mouse Click Andys still existed
[1:31:01] Annathebanana1986: I'm a full clicker, we exist
[1:31:19] MediumRareOG: keyboard turning is crazy
[1:31:31] ImperfectDark: i'm a clicker. I don't even look up
[1:31:34] fooxytv: I don't know how touchpadwarrior uses a touchpad..
[1:31:44] RosieSeren: wait I don't get it, how else do you play without clicking? xD
[1:31:44] Annathebanana1986: Hahahaha @imperfectdark
[1:31:47] physalis4: I was a clicker up till the end of SL
[1:31:54] physalis4: Then I got a Razer Naga
[1:31:56] MediumRareOG: i sometimes keyboard turn when i'm running somewhere but for actual play? way too slow
[1:32:32] fooxytv: I never clicked, I had a molten core edition mouse at the start :D
[1:32:33] LuiBMHunter: is pet happiness still a thing or?
[1:32:39] SinicalDev: I stopped clicking in early cata when I made a fresh warrior to learn the binds over time
[1:32:55] nuclearphosphate: ive got a titanwolf gaming mouse that has number buttons on the side, thats why i never use keybindings
[1:33:06] MIMETIK: hi
[1:33:14] Valestrus: afternoon Dan :) - afternoon chat!
[1:33:17] SinicalDev: I move with RDG though, dont have back pedal bound. I use a two thumb button mouse
[1:34:00] Valestrus: i am well.. day off work today (hurrah!). how are you? cata beta going ok?
[1:34:03] LuiBMHunter: did you tick uprez gfx?
[1:34:11] MIMETIK: hey how can i join to beta cata? is there an option on the launcher of blizz?

[1:34:49] koko_898: hey hey ;)
[1:35:20] fooxytv: I heard some hints regarding the 10.2.6 patch
[1:35:21] RosieSeren: have they given any details about the hearthstone event yet?
[1:35:22] mrsrockguru: I opted in for beta
[1:35:24] Harai_Ulfsark: oh damn hearthstone event, i need to install it again just to login
[1:35:29] Valestrus: hearthstone event in WoW or in hearthstone?
[1:35:37] nuclearphosphate: @RosieSeren yes they have, its on the hearthstone website
[1:35:41] koko_898: beta its closed now ??
[1:35:45] Annathebanana1986: Free mount?!
[1:35:50] mrsrockguru: Both @Valestrus
[1:36:02] RosieSeren: Yeah I saw the mount, but it says something about an wow event in game
[1:36:11] Annathebanana1986: Ahh okies
[1:36:13] MediumRareOG: i logged into hearthstone exactly once, to get Sarge
[1:36:13] koko_898: i mean, only stremers can test it? or all can play?
[1:36:21] nuclearphosphate: @MrGM the hearthstone event info is on the website
[1:36:27] Harai_Ulfsark: its a cross-event between the games
[1:36:45] naseem529: Hello
[1:36:47] nuclearphosphate: oh, for WoW sorry i thought u meant the actual hearthstone game
[1:37:17] Valestrus: did you end up doing Gnomeregan in SoD Dan? How did you find it if so?
[1:37:20] blumberquack: Wonder how much HS I'm gonna have to slog through to get the WoW goods LUL
[1:37:21] SinicalDev: did cata include zone scaling or was that later?
[1:37:24] blumberquack: card games aren't my thing
[1:37:38] Harai_Ulfsark: @SinicalDev that was late legion
[1:37:40] nuclearphosphate: @blumberquack likewise, the ONLY time i played hearthstone was for the hearthsteed mount in this
[1:37:52] SinicalDev: @Harai_Ulfsark damn it all merges into one
[1:38:01] RosieSeren: I'm gonna guess it will be like the diablo event maybe?
[1:38:06] blumberquack: Ohh, that's cool then
[1:38:10] RosieSeren: like a timed boss spawned etc
[1:38:16] Lausten: chauff

[1:38:40] mrsrockguru: yeah when heirlooms turned up
[1:38:43] nuclearphosphate: the chauffeured chopper was an heirloom reward item
[1:38:49] volkreig: it is
[1:39:01] RosieSeren: I think its when they did heirloom collection tab
[1:39:34] RosieSeren: ah okay, I just remember the chauffer being tied to something but I can't remember now xD
[1:39:42] SinicalDev: not having to mail over heirlooms every time i wanna play my alt breaks my immersion BabyRage
[1:40:03] Keltix: Is the Hour of Twilight instances on the map of CoT in this build? Just random curiosity
[1:40:15] mrsrockguru: The chauffer, comes from getting 35 heirlooms
[1:40:28] Harai_Ulfsark: heirloom tab only came in wod tho
[1:40:29] Keltix: I guess that makes sense
[1:40:31] mrsrockguru: can't remember
[1:40:57] Pilums: WoD for heirloom mount

[1:48:10] LuiBMHunter: better to exit and go back in to make sure
[1:48:12] Harai_Ulfsark: need to close the game and relaunch to save them

[1:58:51] Annathebanana1986: So are you moving or just still looking?
[1:59:05] michaelmm: Alpha/Beta can be a bit sparse at the start till Blizz open up the floodgates for more invites.
[1:59:37] physalis4: Nice. That's good news
[1:59:50] RAF_Sean: "Dan you're rich, pick any house you want" - Mortgage company, probably

[2:01:56] Valestrus: you say you own 25% of the part ownership. so what happens if the 75% want to sell the house all of a sudden?
[2:02:02] Annathebanana1986: Yea, house sales are out of this world here
[2:02:24] michaelmm: Did the datamined "uprezzed graphics" setting made it to the UI?
[2:02:30] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:02:37] Voldreka: LOL you call that pricy! I wish we had that rent/own model in Canada. Prices for a home where I live now are 600K+. If I wanted to live in the neighbourhood where I grew up, those houses go for 1mil+ now.
[2:02:39] ne_v_etot_raz: KonCha KonCha
[2:02:39] SinicalDev: we're due to exchange next week, but not completing until july which sucks
[2:02:49] Valestrus: interesting... may look into this myself then.. this has always been my fear.

[2:03:29] travelergrey: travelergrey subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:03:44] Valestrus: my wifes mum bought a house for 3 k quid nowadays is work 600 k
[2:03:47] Valestrus: crazy
[2:03:51] Firelight76: my house we bought in havant in 2015 was ¬£180k, its now worth ¬£260k, and thats in L.P.
[2:04:16] Firelight76: its in the middle of LP
[2:04:21] Firelight76: there is a mcD's as well
[2:04:44] SinicalDev: its fun getting fucked purely based on the date you were born
[2:04:59] Annathebanana1986: adamco4Hahah
[2:05:17] psychoholicx123: to be honest being born in 1990/2000 is much better than 1930.
[2:05:40] exWan: so 275k = 1500 a month? thats insane
[2:06:03] Annathebanana1986: Me and my partner have been looking at moving up north, the houses you can rent/buy are like fucking mansions compared to where we are now for less than half the price
[2:06:22] Voldreka: $1500 is Rent + Mortgage included?
[2:06:23] SinicalDev: the amount they'll give you is mental compared to the reality as well
[2:06:26] Firelight76: how are teh mortgage people about your twitch job?
[2:06:37] MediumRareOG: I'm waiting for Britons to start talking about getting on the shipping container ladder
[2:06:41] Firelight76: ah ok
[2:06:58] Voldreka: I am moving into a new apartment (Not house) and it's $2525 per month. I live 2 hours from a major city... -.-
[2:07:01] SinicalDev: We got a mortgage in principle for ¬£450k but we're buying a ¬£322k 4 bed instead. The mortgage is gonna be ¬£1700, cant imagine what the 450k amount would be
[2:07:03] MogSnap: do you need 2 years of receipts like in the US for self employed?
[2:07:18] Firelight76: there's another platform instead of patreon i heard about the other day, it only takes a flat fee of $4.99 a month from you. I cant remember the name grrr..
[2:07:32] Firelight76: ko-fi
[2:07:48] QTartemis: You have Lua errors
[2:07:55] SinicalDev: theyve just gone up a bit recently
[2:08:10] Voldreka: Does the UK Rent/Own model have any specific name? I'd kind of like to look into it and see if anywhere in Canada has this.
[2:08:22] SinicalDev: we've got 5.85% fixed for 2 years @ 95% LTV
[2:08:23] physalis4: rates are insane in the US. We've been waiting to get a home equity loan (where you borrow against the equity in your home) but rates are just nuts my bank doesn't offer the loans right now
[2:08:49] SinicalDev: freak
[2:08:53] nuclearphosphate: so glad that the mortgage on the family house is paid off in full (which i just found out yesterday is going to myself, my brother and my sister in my parents will) has
[2:08:53] keyboardturner: I didn't see his first message
[2:09:08] keyboardturner: gee I wonder why lol
[2:09:14] MogSnap: thank you technology!
[2:09:14] QTartemis: Should have sent them my way. I have a bit of rage needing letting out :D
[2:09:25] MediumRareOG: trans people broke some people's brains. i don't get it
[2:09:34] RosieSeren: why be like that? you aren't even talking about that topic, think people are hateful just be hateful
[2:09:40] databob1: That's unfortunate
[2:09:50] SinicalDev: Did you see the strings which mention TBC and Wrath realms for Classic?
[2:10:26] Firelight76: isnt the game crashing with an LUA error usually down to addons?
[2:10:29] volkreig: Sad to hear about Akira Toriyama, bought me back to watching DBZ on toonami years ago
[2:10:50] Big_Rum: Hello There! Top of the morning to you and all of the chat. May good Tidings and blessing spread all around on this glorious Friday!
[2:10:55] physalis4: I thought Akira was older than that
[2:11:09] databob1: >(
[2:11:34] physalis4: It reminded me of when Robin Williams died
[2:11:34] Athle86: x5050xLOVE
[2:11:48] Harai_Ulfsark: dragonball is very special to my BF, so he cried himself the whole night when the news came up

[2:12:40] Big_Rum: I just got my coffee and sitting down to watch my good friend Dan and all is right today!
[2:12:45] psychoholicx123: maybe keep off target of target?
[2:12:57] dright424: suck so bad the game kicks you
[2:13:05] Harai_Ulfsark: could it be because we dont have hit rating on retail anymore?
[2:13:05] FrostBeered: does cata have the new character models?
[2:13:07] Big_Rum: I love agood secret
[2:13:08] physalis4: terrible
[2:13:11] MogSnap: do you have a 10.2.6 folder?

[2:18:37] SinicalDev: election year in uk and us - gotta ramp up the culture wars
[2:18:48] nuclearphosphate: LUL
[2:18:50] physalis4: what a weirdo
[2:18:52] RosieSeren: this is so weird, why go through so much effort
[2:18:53] QTartemis: You're so popular, people make a new account just to upset you
[2:18:57] QTartemis: That's dedi.cation.
[2:18:57] Big_Rum: 2 minutes ago how cringe
[2:19:15] keyboardturner: maybe this time it'll do something!
[2:19:24] zaprenk: Are you using the "Uprezzed" graphics?
[2:19:30] nuclearphosphate: never heard of ban evasion
[2:20:06] nuclearphosphate: ah gotcha
[2:20:20] QTartemis: Well it does say SUSPECTED ban evader
[2:20:20] understudy1: @MrGM As a first time player, ive read that shadowlands is the last expansion after dragonflight, but the quests are taking me to BFA, should i not be doing shadowlands?
[2:20:23] nuclearphosphate: thats sweet
[2:20:24] QTartemis: They may not be a ban evader :D
[2:20:31] Athle86: yeah there's some people out there that lost their marbles, was watching another streamer and she was getting invite requests constantly from some weirdo while playing using a her name + a demeaning word
[2:20:33] Harai_Ulfsark: its not like you're even at the top of the wow category for those weirdos to appear here this much
[2:21:01] Big_Rum: BFA if your alliance
[2:21:03] QTartemis: BfA is 1-50, Shadowlands 50-60, DF 60-70... No?
[2:21:09] tempo119: shadowlands is a bit off the hinges
[2:21:16] tempo119: no, all old xpacs are 1-60
[2:21:18] nuclearphosphate: honestly if i had to choose between expansions, i would NOT go shadowlands to level LUL
[2:21:19] keyboardturner: widepeepoHappy
[2:21:36] Harai_Ulfsark: @understudy1 reason is shadowlands is too alien of a setting for a new player coming green from exile's reach, and you cant fly there when you reach lvl 30
[2:21:36] havoom01: oh you play SoD,tough u started another hunter on retail
[2:21:38] Ryuuza930: you going to be raid ready for that testing :)

[2:22:57] y0mii: thought achievements were in wrath?
[2:23:06] havoom01: waaait..you are on cata beta? or what does Dan play right now?

[2:24:55] Firelight76: i hope so - i kinda lost interest in WoW when all my life fell apart, now i feel like i've fallen behind. :(
[2:25:02] SinicalDev: do you think every blizzcon will be good to go to now with the world soul saga, or will it be the usual, every other one is good

[2:25:44] havoom01: what if they add mythic+ in this new cata server,do you think pps will play it?
[2:26:19] Big_Rum: Do you think your brother would go again? It was kinda cool having him there and his pictures were amazing
[2:26:27] ratgefingah: classic players will throw a fit if they get infinite scaling content
[2:27:12] Big_Rum: So your brother looks nothing like you.. Does your other brother resemble yuou?
[2:27:38] Firelight76: no mounts yet?
[2:27:48] TeaLeaf_TVx: would be interesting to see if we get MoP classic....and then WoD lol i wonder where they will stop

[2:28:44] nuclearphosphate: next thing will be classic classic
[2:28:44] ratgefingah: the beards r very simillar
[2:28:46] MogSnap: theres no chance wod classic happens
[2:29:00] MogSnap: maybe wod/mop together
[2:29:07] Firelight76: WoD Classic lasts for 7 years - like it felt like it did back in the day.
[2:29:08] blumberquack: @nuclearphosphate We kinda got that with the seasons LUL
[2:29:12] ratgefingah: end it with pandaria classic, really wanna play that expansion
[2:29:28] QTartemis: They need to do WoD, so we can have all expacs on CASC :rofl:
[2:29:29] Firelight76: awwww
[2:29:30] Harai_Ulfsark: yes
[2:29:33] Big_Rum: she look like her momma
[2:29:35] TeaLeaf_TVx: MoP was pretty good imo but thats when they took away the talent trees so i doubt they will go ahead with it, unless it gets alot of changes
[2:29:36] antiva: she's so cute
[2:29:49] Firelight76: oh yeah looks like her mum

[2:31:17] nuclearphosphate: thats really weird sayings TBH when folk say "X has your eyes" or something. i think of it like they have stole your eyes from your head LUL
[2:31:19] Roflrobbie: babies are awesome and being a dad is the most incredible honor
[2:31:42] Big_Rum: I keep my daughter on my lock screen and my son is so jealous..im like the phrase is "daddy's girl" just the way it is :)

[2:37:54] Harai_Ulfsark: my favorite bug with the flightpaths is when the gryphon just does a straight line from point A to B and clips through mountains and ground when doing so
[2:38:15] Firelight76: @Harai_Ulfsark then you get banned for hacking lol
[2:38:22] Frijid: They should just attach a couple of rockets to the gryphons
[2:38:45] Roflrobbie: dang those talent trees are *chefs kiss*
[2:39:08] Harai_Ulfsark: black arrow is survival
[2:39:27] Khinjars: Best version of survival for me ( with MoP version )
[2:39:27] LuiBMHunter: talent points aren't at every level
[2:39:47] Harai_Ulfsark: @Firelight76 that happened naturally for a while in retail, i dont remember when but maybe on BfA to SL transition
[2:40:41] Roflrobbie: so xalatath is def mucking around in SoD to screw with retail time line, agreed?
[2:41:03] newkingcody: human hunter ratJAM

[2:42:58] Harai_Ulfsark: @ImperfectDark I used party sync with a trial account, but was terrible bc taking a while the pools ended up despawning
[2:43:14] Khinjars: OH YES, cannot wait for the loading screen of TWW ofc
[2:43:32] ImperfectDark: @Harai_Ulfsark i'll put it low on my list, so lol. I think one of the mounts is locked behind that isn't it?
[2:43:32] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:43:39] Lausten: What did you break now? Kappa
[2:43:46] Harai_Ulfsark: oh right i love login screens and expansion theme reveal

[2:44:31] Harai_Ulfsark: @ImperfectDark yeah i think the comments said the gruesome flayedwing was behind it? but i already have it somehow maybe from another source
[2:44:59] physalis4: so...everything going according to plan LUL
[2:45:22] Firelight76: what was the cap in Cata?
[2:45:23] NotaClssc: Its pretty much only the new 1-80 leveling path that is available, yeah?
[2:45:23] Firelight76: 85?
[2:45:24] Big_Rum: I need to make a coffesiion ... I hate the asmon doesnt play wow like he used too. I miss transmog and mount offs. that content was just so good..
[2:45:37] Harai_Ulfsark: @Firelight76 yes
[2:46:11] newkingcody: leveling is much easier in cata if i remember
[2:46:18] Firelight76: yeah
[2:46:20] Firelight76: do it
[2:46:22] Khinjars: Maybe they'll fix some bugs
[2:46:22] ImperfectDark: always time for a coffee
[2:46:35] NotaClssc: Yeah, its a lot of content for sure and needs a lot of testing so makes sense to start with it. If it had 80+ content available nearly nobody would play the new 1-80
[2:46:36] physalis4: "What's the time Ms Wolf?"....parents might get that ref

[4:05:53] bojackhorseman2004: Norway
[4:06:36] bojackhorseman2004: well, the goverment just suppliments the company and its required by law. If the responsibility was put on the coperation
[4:06:50] demololtv: normal
[4:06:52] bojackhorseman2004: then that could lead to some shitty situations where your work would try to take as little matarnity as possible
[4:06:57] Lausten: Yeah rares give a ton of XP even today
[4:08:12] bojackhorseman2004: Finally classic and retail are in the expansion where you can do the exact same content in both versions of the game

[4:19:01] Jeremy: no @Jelky55 thats an abomination
[4:19:18] tyraell91: Do you play other games than WoW?

[4:19:34] JBonezey: The picture book versions
[4:19:34] Jelky55: baby shark is not an abomination
[4:19:40] Jelky55: xDD
[4:19:46] Sleepyjoegaming: my mannn
[4:20:05] Jeremy: baby shark is the worst thing other than barney that has ever existed
[4:20:06] Sleepyjoegaming: if you level in the beta does the character cross over?
[4:20:14] Jeremy: well maybe teletubies
[4:20:30] xpsha: if you like lord of the rings you'll like Dune 1 and Dune 2  movies and the books
[4:20:33] JBonezey: @Sleepyjoegaming crossover into the afterlife?
[4:21:42] xpsha: I watched number 1 when it first released and number 1 again last friday and then the part 2 in cinema saturday 100% recommend
[4:21:47] Elrathir: Read Dune for your daughter :)
[4:21:49] Sleepyjoegaming: @JBonezey not just yet haha maybe i should skip cata as if i fall of deathwings back one more time in life i may go to the afterlife

[4:21:55] Xamarri: Sora?
[4:22:07] JBonezey: Nah Dune 1 is very good
[4:22:07] chelfx: Dune 1 and 2 is art
[4:22:21] Sleepyjoegaming: your wolf is fuming
[4:22:21] Xamarri: The AI that makes movies :P
[4:22:22] xpsha: Dune 1 is on netflix for free with sub and it is about spice
[4:22:24] chelfx: some the best Sci fi we ever got
[4:22:29] JBonezey: Let me ask you this Dan, do you think any of the LOTR movies are boring?
[4:22:36] tyraell91: Any idea about 10.2.6?
[4:22:47] Sleepyjoegaming: say no
[4:22:53] Sleepyjoegaming: wait the hobbits were
[4:22:55] Xamarri: CAREFUL what you say about LotR
[4:23:22] JBonezey: EP1 is very poorly written for children
[4:23:32] xpsha: watching dune 2 in cinema imax is stunning and a moment I loved its about spice, space travel and like villians don't want to spoil too much
[4:23:55] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatREE !@#$%
[4:24:00] xpsha: spice is used for space travel
[4:24:21] Zenison: You don't use AI for your stream content?! Lol
[4:24:30] xpsha: if you have netflix just get it up there
[4:24:30] Jack_the_Dipper: Manthieus is already doing that
[4:24:52] Jack_the_Dipper: You can try Bing Image Creator. Pretty good and free
[4:24:57] Sleepyjoegaming: maybe clipping and stuff using ai is quicker btu apart from that i couldnt see it being useful
[4:25:12] HuntingElk: You mean you are a real person?!? I thought you were AI
[4:25:25] physalis4: It's weird how AI has a certain look to it
[4:25:35] xpsha: DanAI instead of DanMrGM
[4:25:42] Jack_the_Dipper: Manthieus uses something else. Not OpenAI one
[4:25:44] Sleepyjoegaming: @physalis4 like a horror game character look
[4:26:57] Jack_the_Dipper: AI is still very young and you can sometimes see it in art. Give it time and you wont see the difference
[4:27:00] Pazy160: Embrace the jank and force everyone to use MS Paint logos made in 10 minutes.
[4:27:02] archmagus1: AI art also just looks‚Ä¶. not pleasing to the eye, to say the least
[4:27:05] BethiaB: pls make your pet happy
[4:27:13] physalis4: I think AI will take over and graphic artists will go the way of newspapers
[4:27:24] Sleepyjoegaming: i mean i would always go to artist as its unique but i wouldnt pick out people for ujsing it
[4:27:36] Light2512: hi
[4:27:46] xpsha: ai is becoming more and more like the norm my uni forbids it if used for an assignment some lectures openly say to use it to generate data that you need fast like a table of data or figures
[4:27:48] JBonezey: Laws won't matter, its a cheap and easy way for people to use to make money or scam people
[4:27:56] Mucrush: Jesus
[4:27:58] Sleepyjoegaming: why is your hunter using a gun and not melee what in the SOD is this
[4:28:10] Zenison: I think it's time to generate an AI art smiley face and overlay it over the sad face on your pet lol
[4:28:11] MachoCham: Please will someone tell Dan his pet is sad :(
[4:28:29] physalis4: Why is your pet so sad Dan
[4:28:48] Jack_the_Dipper: Instead of googling something, I can get straits answers and I can keep asking about it. You can't do that with a simple search engine like goolge or bing
[4:28:52] xpsha: yeah I used it on a excel file I had as it saves time to focus on the main assignment at hand
[4:28:58] funviking99: LUL
[4:29:11] JBonezey: Remember you can't rename your pet, you have to have someone make a pet rename item? That's Cata right?
[4:29:15] fooxytv: have you seen AutoGPT? it fully automates a team of project managers, devs etc to develop a website or something
[4:29:24] MachoCham: For the DDI we said AI art was fine. It's a free short term event and won't be monetised. Teams wouldn't hire an artist either
[4:29:24] Jack_the_Dipper: I love the AI search engines, its so handy to learn and find things
[4:29:31] physalis4: Emergence of Chat GPT
[4:29:34] Mucrush: AI can be used in so many cool ways, but when it takes over peoples jobs, thats bad
[4:29:46] Zenison: There are also a lot more free versions of it
[4:29:50] Jack_the_Dipper: LEt me try to search you on Copilot
[4:29:50] xpsha: Windows Ai is copilot
[4:29:53] Hjallimar: I feel like its such a shame that we make AI to take over the creative parts of work instead of focusing it on other areas first
[4:29:53] physalis4: everything exploded after Chat GPT went mainstream
[4:30:04] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[4:30:04] HuntingElk: society has started to become lazy, and eventually depend on AI
[4:30:44] Jack_the_Dipper: Is asked Copilot who MrGM is. 'Dan Carter, better known online as MrGM, is an English YouTuber whose content primarily revolves around the World of Warcraft game series. He resides in Guildford, England and uploaded his first video on March 10, 2011. MrGM‚Äôs channel features a variety of World of Warcraft videos, covering topics such as rare mounts, gameplay insights, and updates related to the game.'
[4:30:54] keyboardturner: I think a nicer application for AI would be to throw it at really annoying tasks like taxes
[4:30:57] JBonezey: @HuntingElk our society is lazy compared to our parents, and our parents compared to our gparents and so on and so on. Not a logical take imo
[4:31:02] Getcha_Pulll: thats Adobe Firefly (which is AI)
[4:31:10] Mucrush: There's this indie game called Suck Up that uses AI to generate conversations between the player and NPC and it works VERY well! Thats the stuff AI should be used for
[4:31:34] Getcha_Pulll: its integrated
[4:31:35] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:31:42] Zuldak: so this is cata classic
[4:31:47] xpsha: it is like fairly new just appeared one day and I was like ohhhh windows has ai now heck even snapchat has ai
[4:31:48] Jack_the_Dipper: @MrGM is the info correct? Posted above
[4:31:58] HuntingElk: @JBonezey exactly
[4:32:41] exWan: you forget to mention he's a dashing individual
[4:32:54] michaelmm: I think things like using AI to make armor fit characters better is an example of where it can be used to make things better.
[4:33:08] Zenison: LOL
[4:33:20] xpsha: Snapchat uses AI now what is so weird
[4:33:26] vorpaldank: too broke for gametime living vicariously through you rn
[4:33:27] keyboardturner: it was both a patent and then confirmed in use by Ion
[4:33:29] michaelmm: Yeah Blizzard have been testing that tech.
[4:34:04] databob1: @mrgm bit how does that make your pet feel?
[4:34:07] michaelmm: The Hearthstone team have told their contractors that using AI for art is forbidden. I assume Wow has the same rule.
[4:34:08] Jack_the_Dipper: Now I asked Gemini: MrGM is likely referring to a YouTuber who creates content focused on the popular online game World of Warcraft (WoW). Here's what I found about MrGM:  YouTube Channel: MrGM has a YouTube channel  ([YouTube MrGM channel]) with over 127,000 subscribers. The channel features WoW content, including:  Updates and news about the game, including upcoming features and expansions. Guides on various aspects of the game, such as how to obtain mounts and transmogs.
[4:34:18] Jack_the_Dipper: Playthroughs of storylines and content patches. Focus on World of Warcraft:  Based on the content on the YouTube channel, MrGM appears to be primarily dedicated to World of Warcraft.  Twitch Presence: MrGM also has a Twitch channel (Twitch), though it seems to have a smaller following compared to the YouTube channel
[4:34:22] xpsha: theres gonna be ai out there that takes you as a streamer a photo of you and then makes your mouth talk with audio
[4:34:39] HuntingElk: When do you think AI will take over the educational system.
[4:34:56] Jack_the_Dipper: Gemini is Google's AI search engine
[4:35:16] Mucrush: KEKW
[4:35:17] keyboardturner: Sadge
[4:35:19] physalis4: lol savage
[4:35:19] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL
[4:35:33] Zenison: Hey your pet is sad
[4:35:33] physalis4: Nothing like AI to bring you down
[4:36:00] bojackhorseman2004: why is mrgms pet sad?
[4:36:18] Zenison: NEGLECT
[4:36:32] Elrathir: the pet is sad because it's broken, just like me
[4:36:34] JBonezey: are you BM?
[4:36:37] ImperfectDark: what does pet sadness do anyway?
[4:36:41] Dirtnose: banned for neglecting pet
[4:36:42] RetroHACK: it heard you
[4:36:48] dright424: its sad because he knows his existence is temporary and will end when the beta resets
[4:36:49] Mucrush: monkaHmm
[4:36:56] Elrathir: Unpoggers
[4:36:58] bojackhorseman2004: not the world :(
[4:37:00] Zenison: ashed the game, wowCr
[4:37:11] Mucrush: Blizzard: "MrGM you've revealed too many of our flaws. We had to take action" Kappa
[4:37:13] HuntingElk: Your pet did it 'cause he's sad
[4:37:19] Jack_the_Dipper: Is because of the sad pet
[4:37:30] bojackhorseman2004: time to do some react content? watch the new weekly reset by taliesen and evitel
[4:37:37] michaelmm: MrGM finds all the bugs! :-)
[4:37:39] Elrathir: this is the anti-Pog
[4:37:46] mrtibbs2013: feed it
[4:37:56] bojackhorseman2004: Thanks nora

[4:38:57] Jack_the_Dipper: Maybe it has worms @MrGM

[4:39:20] Kaaluu1: does pet like fish?
[4:39:43] mrtibbs2013: can all play the beta

[4:44:04] databob1: @mrgm so what makes a pet so sad during these early days of the Cataclysm
[4:44:07] Sleepyjoegaming: when did duel talents come in ?

[4:44:29] Zenison: NEGLECT!
[4:44:49] Jack_the_Dipper: HE has worms
[4:44:49] Big_Rum: What if anything will change from OG Cata ? Are they making any QOL changes?
[4:44:52] Valestrus: i think they should bring back the pet happiness system. i dont play hunter but i can see it adding a layer immersion that doesn't exist anymore
[4:44:58] Cannerek: seems borked
[4:45:22] xpsha: clsymcata?
[4:45:23] databob1: I had to do that for a week in the hospital I can relate
[4:45:23] JBonezey: Yes

[4:45:30] wastedxtime93: We deserve a pet rework or something similar to Locks
[4:45:32] Khinjars: Yes u had to

[4:49:35] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[4:49:36] xpsha: The main question would you rather eat indian or chines?
[4:49:38] MediumRareOG: i love nandos. i'm hearing heresy
[4:49:41] ahux_: in some countries they might take it literal
[4:49:46] Jack_the_Dipper: We do the same in the Netherlands. We having Chinees
[4:49:52] JBonezey: if we wanted chinese tonight we would call it chinese take out
[4:50:04] Kalaila_: yeah, that was all over tiktok for a bit LUL people were confused by "a Chinese"
[4:50:17] xpsha: The main question would you rather eat indian or chinese?
[4:50:34] JBonezey: UK has banging Indian
[4:50:47] xpsha: I would do indian over chines e
[4:51:06] Jack_the_Dipper: Chinese or Indonesian food kaatGasm
[4:51:07] xpsha: that is so true
[4:51:10] MediumRareOG: american chinese is awful, as an aside
[4:51:36] xpsha: there is one I live by when I am not at uni and the lighting is amazing the vibes are so decent
[4:51:46] JBonezey: american cheese is supposed to be cheap and thus awful, they made it cheaply for World Wars
[4:52:15] MediumRareOG: all chinese is localized
[4:52:21] JBonezey: wait I totally misread that
[4:52:26] CrowMomocle: it's processed
[4:52:30] ahux_: americans chuck loads of chemicals in there food right?
[4:52:41] click4: american cheese is amazing
[4:52:52] databob1: @mrgm I didn't want to call attention in case you didn't notice but your pet is a bit sad
[4:52:56] click4: Yes everything we eat is full of chlorine and all sorts of fun stuff.
[4:53:12] MachoCham: Who unpinned my message Madge
[4:53:23] MachoCham: Red top milk ?
[4:53:33] keyboardturner: @MachoCham me
[4:53:34] xpsha: there is one I live by when I am not at uni and the lighting is amazing the vibes are so decent at the indian and that links to like when you go barbers you get an experience there too
[4:53:36] Harper_n7: means marketing is working
[4:53:39] HuntingElk: Soo filled with harmful Chemicals
[4:53:54] Harper_n7: those strawberries probably lasted like 2 days :(
[4:54:01] MediumRareOG: it's not that american groceries are good. UK groceries are just... bad
[4:54:11] Harper_n7: gallon jugs of milk is pretty nice
[4:54:12] HuntingElk: gallon of milk will last like 2 weeks
[4:54:14] physalis4: I saw his tweet. It was pretty accurate for how much food is here. I spend about $200/week on groceries for a family of 4
[4:54:18] JBonezey: Costco does mid fruit here, Sam's does better
[4:54:27] JBonezey: Our measurement system is stupid af
[4:54:36] MediumRareOG: Bread from American supermarkets is a hate crime
[4:54:41] Harper_n7: if I get a gallon of milk, I'm drinking milk and eating cereal a lot lol
[4:55:03] HuntingElk: with all the cemicals thats why it will not spoil
[4:55:04] Jack_the_Dipper: Why are the German chocolate eggs not allowed in the US?
[4:55:07] Harper_n7: American bread apparently has a ton of sugar in it or something  idk
[4:55:09] Getcha_Pulll: yeap
[4:55:09] sarkOpharg: They do have proper bread, but some of it would be cake in europe
[4:55:12] xpsha: there is one I live by when I am not at uni and the lighting is amazing the vibes are so decent at the indian and that links to like when you go barbers you get an experience there too love going the barbers tbf
[4:55:15] nyrhalahotep: it's because Americans are so spoiled that they only provide the most beautiful products and throw away the rest, making sure homeless don't get access them.   it's a dystopian cesspool.
[4:55:16] JBonezey: Half gallon, quart
[4:55:17] Harper_n7: Yeah, you can get like quarts of milk and smaller
[4:55:19] Jack_the_Dipper: yes those
[4:55:20] HuntingElk: 1/2 and pints
[4:55:22] keyboardturner: because we're dumb and eat the toys
[4:55:24] MediumRareOG: I'm convinced whoever designed American bread has never actually eaten bread
[4:55:36] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatDerp wuh?
[4:55:40] FlutterBaby: @nyrhalahotep wtf
[4:55:43] neverbornlucky: We use milk in cooking not just eating it in cereal
[4:55:48] JBonezey: Sort of
[4:55:51] MachoCham: I love a wonky carrot
[4:55:54] Jack_the_Dipper: @keyboardturner kaatREE STOP EATING TOYS!
[4:55:55] databob1: Most of our strawberries are grown in tropical zones. If strawberry plants don't get to winter they produce large but flavorless strawberries
[4:55:56] Harper_n7: I mean... kinda
[4:55:57] Harper_n7: lol
[4:56:02] physalis4: whaaaat?
[4:56:02] MediumRareOG: The baguette you can get from Tesco is better than anything you can buy from an American or Australian supermarket
[4:56:02] nyrhalahotep: in America, they pull out all the nutrients by over, processing the grains, you have to actively seek out pure ground flour, in order to get healthy bread with no poisons or preservatives
[4:56:20] dright424: When i worked in a supermarket the food that was going to go bad went to a food pantry
[4:56:26] HuntingElk: Use milk to make chocolate milk
[4:56:33] JBonezey: So our farmers throw away a % of their crops so that their crops maintain a certain value
[4:56:35] JBonezey: Organic
[4:56:45] xpsha: farmfoods is all frozen foods
[4:56:59] Arlaeya: there are places to get better produce but it depends on location
[4:57:05] HuntingElk: yup there is Arsenic in most store bought food
[4:57:25] MogSnap: its expensive to be healthy in the us
[4:57:28] MogSnap: is the problem
[4:57:30] xpsha: there is one near my uni and my coursemate goes purely cos its cheap and frozen like burgers etc at farmfoods but the name doesn't fit imo you would think fresh
[4:57:33] MachoCham: Organic more means over here that checmicals were not used in the farming process
[4:57:35] nyrhalahotep: whole Foods and farmers markets are the best place to buy food, but even then you have to be sure to wash off all the pesticides that contain poisons, etc.
[4:57:37] magemaster225: organic is a misnomer in the US, it just means it wasnt treated with pesticides, can still be genetically modified
[4:57:44] Harper_n7: You don't have DOUBLE STUFF?!
[4:57:49] Harper_n7: rip
[4:57:55] MachoCham: BUT we also have healthcare so yolo

[4:58:21] keyboardturner: they jacked up the prices, so no
[4:58:28] databob1: No it cost too much
[4:58:29] physalis4: Maybe the UK is the dystopian land....no oreo double stuff jkjk
[4:58:32] keyboardturner: also I don't trust the drivers not to eat the food anymore
[4:58:32] Dirtnose: we have double stuff, I get them from tesco but we dont have like any of the other ones
[4:58:45] ace4462: I have a friend that works from home and only lives off of door dash in a highly populated area. He never leaves home. NotLikeThis
[4:58:46] Arlaeya: I don't but I know plenty of who do. doordash and the like are expensive
[4:58:46] HuntingElk: there was an article about Door dashers,  the people working were/are sampling your food...lol
[4:58:48] monopacks: we do
[4:58:49] MachoCham: For a family of 6 I'm surprised if a chinese/indian or grill takeaway is cheaper than ¬£50
[4:58:52] databob1: And it's a scam no accountability
[4:58:59] srsuth: Depends on how far from a city you live. My door dash in this small farm town is 15-20 delivery fee
[4:59:02] nyrhalahotep: you can Google foods from America that are outlawed/banned in other countries, even some of the American foods that DO get exported; the ingredients list is only a quarter of what they stuff into the American products.
[4:59:06] MediumRareOG: Also, the seafood you buy in both the US and UK is so bad I have to go back to Australia to remind myself that I actually like fish
[4:59:13] Jack_the_Dipper: Isnt Wendy's like introducing dynamic prices?
[4:59:19] neverbornlucky: who needs door dash when you can get to everywhere in america by bus
[4:59:27] JBonezey: We ordered Korean fried chicken the other night take away and it was 80 USD
[4:59:31] JBonezey: FOR 2 people
[4:59:34] MachoCham: This is why we use the AA breakdown app for 15-20% off GreenKing etc
[4:59:47] JBonezey: Nope
[4:59:50] srsuth: no no 15-20 dollars delivery fee
[4:59:52] JBonezey: Won't go there again
[5:00:06] physalis4: Not going to Wendy's anymore
[5:00:07] magemaster225: they backed off it
[5:00:10] MediumRareOG: Wendy's scrapped dynamic pricing after the backlash
[5:00:11] MachoCham: Bus? I'm not getting on a bus. I have a pink card to say I don't need to use public transport with the unwashed masses
[5:00:19] HuntingElk: @MediumRareOG I use to have a friend that lived and fished in alaska, he would send me some, but sadly he has passed away...
[5:00:30] srsuth: takes well over an hour to deliver
[5:00:30] neverbornlucky: I thought wow sod be dead by now lol

[5:01:14] keyboardturner: EZ
[5:01:14] Kaaluu1: our bus service is non existent. am in outlying suburb
[5:01:16] JBonezey: Reports in the 1960s due to a mass increase of drug use
[5:01:20] keyboardturner: nothing to see there
[5:01:29] databob1: Wendy's would safe them selves a lot of pain and trouble if they just closed thier stores and declared bankruptcy.
[5:01:32] neverbornlucky: all drones
[5:01:34] Jack_the_Dipper: 342k people watching WoW on Twitch..... yep pretty dead

[5:02:31] JBonezey: BK sucks
[5:02:32] neverbornlucky: thats cause USA doesn't eat at wendy's anymore
[5:02:39] SinicalDev: Chipotle is dogshit compared to Tortilla
[5:02:43] Harper_n7: If a Wendy's came to my town, they'd make a TV show about my 400 pound life or something

[5:03:22] databob1: It may be good but dynamic pricing will just teach people to make other plans if there are many people there
[5:04:12] MachoCham: This isn't screaming gym music at me so far

[5:11:08] Zenison: Saying 'x' just doesn't feel right
[5:11:14] sehtrad: does the hd mode works?
[5:11:34] nyrhalahotep: I will forever dead name Twitter, like Musky dead names his own daughter
[5:11:38] neverbornlucky: the first beer reach is the right of parenthood cause all kids reach for drinks not knowing what they are
[5:11:51] Xamarri: Gnomes rocking that paper chic.
[5:11:52] Jack_the_Dipper: I will say, he is the only one so far making X (Twitter) profitable because Twitter has never been proftable
[5:11:58] MachoCham: I mean right of parenthood is a reach

[5:18:46] DuranorNL: Is leveling mutch faster then Wotlk leveling ?
[5:19:04] AlfredK: I already said it on your tweet but I'm pretty sure ores and herbs give a lot of xp
[5:19:22] JBonezey: its faster in that the zones are more consolidated with go to hub, gets 6-10 quests, do quests go to next hub
[5:19:25] DuranorNL: Good to hear.

[5:27:23] JBonezey: When Cata came out, within the first major 9 month drought patch another MMO came out called RIFT. and Vanilla RIFT was as good as "Classic" WoW. I miss that game.
[5:27:49] Xamarri: RIFT was nice :(
[5:27:57] neverbornlucky: I feel sorry for horde leveling zones in cata lol
