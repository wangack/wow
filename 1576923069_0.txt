[0:32:35] birdmanuno: i have a question, will TBC servers still be open? or we all have to move to wrath? sorry im a noob
[0:33:19] UltraKSlaya: lol how does the contract affect you negatively
[0:33:24] jmalmin: Vaults... opening all the vaults tomorrow... 3 star LFR vaults on 21 characters. Dont think I will be doing that again.
[0:33:38] queej01: is wow classic any good chat? i haven’t played in a few years and i’ve been playing retail for the last month
[0:33:50] Molvonos: The fact that the social contract is what's keeping someone from playing is, frankly, mind boggling.
[0:33:59] jmalmin: Only way to find out if wow classic is good is to play it yourself and find out that way.
[0:34:01] Akuma_Akatsuki: ^^^
[0:34:12] llNoTToXiCll: @queej01 try it only you  can see if its fun or not

[0:34:15] UltraKSlaya: shows what kind of person they are...
[0:34:17] breadwilton: Its much more simple
[0:34:21] spookychefkarolina: @skullgrinx with all due respect, if the contract is affecting you negatively - perhaps you might be the problem. The Social Contract simply makes it a nicer environment for everyone and deters those who are bullies from being so.
[0:34:31] llNoTToXiCll: @jmalmin  great minds think alike i guess hahah
[0:34:33] Skullgrinx: Education is coming. Starting in 2023.
[0:34:43] leroyblinkintv: honestly, with how different of a game it is, @jmalmin is 100000% correct. Classic isnt for everyone but you wont know its not for you until you run it up
[0:34:48] theoriginalzinng: im personally not a fan of what classic has become which is gdkp runs and boost spam, its more fun to level than it is to end game
[0:34:54] Towelliee: are servers up im stuck on retrieving realm list
[0:34:56] Holysal: @Molvonos its good. that means they are the problem. its working

[1:09:53] HaloS23: @Sollice So long term future question: With all the cross faction/ cross server stuff seeming to be on the horizon, do you forsee "server" stuff being non-issue soon?
[1:09:54] Timothious: I thought the launcher said like 7 hours from now?
[1:09:56] Keyastaron_: best bet go for helm?
[1:09:56] cptrogers123: that is a lot of damage no?

[1:25:25] Stonefather: Bro I was finally gonna binge watch Harry Potter this weekend Keepo

[1:25:35] prodigiousgaming: wow
[1:25:37] Phatori: there is a fan theory that Neville is the kid from the prophecy not Harry. And that Voldermort just read it wrong and went after the wrong family.
[1:25:44] PvtHudson093: In the books there are 2 possible children that meet the prophecy and one of those were Neville and the other was Harry
[1:25:46] MethmM: What did u make of the harry potter series. did u like it

[1:26:41] Grimmerino90: neville is a true gigachad
[1:26:49] PvtHudson093: Voldemort pick the halfblood Harry over Pure blood Neville
[1:26:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: He got his sock, tho
[1:26:52] neonn91: next you will be spoiling who wins the tri wizard cup
[1:26:53] CodyKane: @Towelliee What you think of the Snape reveal?
[1:26:57] SnooWhite: In the books you also learn that Voldy was the one who deicded which boy was the "chosen" by trying to kill him. And this marking him as the chosen one.

[1:28:52] Sollice: Snape was a Sneak Eater until he learned about lilly being prego and had to go to dumbledoor to protect Harry and became a double agent
[1:28:56] Phatori: The actor for Snape  (alan rickman)once said, that he hopes when he is 80 he will be reading harry potter and his grand kids will say, "after all this time?" and he could reply "Always"
[1:29:09] Retro1989: Nah a spell did that Kappa
[1:29:10] Timothious: Snape showed you what happens when you get involved with evil people
[1:29:12] positive_ions: the only good thing snape did was trick volde into thinking he owned the elder wand
[1:29:12] STEFOXYS: !fresh

[1:29:21] HonestPhilosophy: He's playing Weird Al soon
[1:29:32] Phatori: Harry's actor was drunk from movie 4--7 he dealth with big alcohol issues
[1:29:36] Megadisaster24: biopic

[1:29:46] Ocenus: biopic for sure looks funny
[1:29:50] SLoPPYALieN: Biopic Weird Al... going to be dope.
[1:29:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: GO GO GO
[1:30:00] lucid_wow: dude i swear since harry potter radcliffe has just taken the most random weird roles and i have a lot of respect for that
[1:30:02] PvtHudson093: Weird Al Biopic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCNKdJ2CIJk&ab_channel=alyankovic
[1:30:09] rohdey: @Towelliee have you seen Horns? decent radcliffe flick
[1:30:13] Timothious: did they use the snake to kill snape in the movie?
[1:30:14] r0b928: Emma Watson is the one celebrity I have permission from my wife to get with
[1:30:14] Nokterian: Him being Weird Al makes it even better
[1:30:14] lucid_wow: my man went from being harry potter to being a farting corpse to being weird al
[1:30:14] CYNIC308: has he tho? no one really talks about any of his movies
[1:30:15] GODZILR1: harry wasnt even a wizard til like the 4th movies, he spends his time sneaking around and playing with potiions, that makes him a rogue
[1:30:18] Srakir: Guns Akimbo was awesome!
[1:30:20] MethmM: @Sollice you a big HP fan?
[1:30:20] CodyKane: omg the Weird Al movie looks hilarious with Daniel R
[1:30:22] SLoPPYALieN: super random weird roles... and LOTS of them are just amazing
[1:30:23] barrygaminginc: Is "Fated" status for the world boss not active? I got a 207 lol
[1:30:23] dimofodi: I saw a meme about him accepting roles "Hey daniel here's this really weird script" "im in"
[1:30:29] Bernardo994: Robin Hood with Costner
[1:30:31] Sollice: I wanted to but I never saw the movie where he was like a dead guy that had to be moved around. Almost like Weekend at Bernies
[1:30:33] SLoPPYALieN: @Srakir HELL YEAH! Guns Akimbo was great!
[1:30:35] memnon94: @GODZILR1 kek

[1:31:08] BrothaLatinoHeat76: So question, @Towelliee Going Horde OR Alliance on WotLK Classic Fresh Server???
[1:31:10] Twill923: i want my main to help
[1:31:10] CamelStep: how Brewmaster looks on DF so far ?
[1:31:11] Megadisaster24: Fresh means starting from Level 1 right?
[1:31:11] barrygaminginc: @dimofodi Revendreth
[1:31:12] Twill923: lol
[1:31:15] Shrenko: imagine not playing fresh ResidentSleeper
[1:31:17] Nokterian: nah dont think so
[1:31:21] MethmM: @Sollice SAME, like i love the books and stuff but i forget so much. Hogwarts legacy made me get into it all agian

[1:31:43] BrothaLatinoHeat76: YEs! 50% is a thing on FRESH
[1:31:48] Thoreya: still not sure if im playing wrath yet
[1:31:50] xcharles_: !fresh
[1:31:50] Moobot: @xcharles_ Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[1:31:55] TombStoneMercenary: Going wait for the credits before I decide on fresh servers depends on how long they last saw what SOM was like fun for a day and everyone left
[1:32:00] bosen7: Got 3 days off work, got food/snacks $20 bucks, power just went out for 240k in Michigan, priceless on patch day
[1:32:03] Tomka53: is that an assasination rogue o_O
[1:32:04] Shrenko: fresh is the most fun to be had in WOW imo
[1:32:13] inj0shwetrust: But you gotta stop throwing bombs then
[1:32:22] CYNIC308: LUL hunter has to be aware the mob even enraged
[1:32:23] TheRukis: @everyone what do you thing is going to have more player the old bc servers or fresh ones?
[1:32:28] MILESkg21: bosen7 well that sucks BibleThump

[1:32:34] CritcobainTV: Ewww assassination
[1:32:38] CritcobainTV: what is he doinnng
[1:32:39] luckfore: is leveling through dungeon finder fast in wotlk?
[1:32:40] Timothious: I wonder how hard it will be to find mobs to kill for quests
[1:32:41] lucid_wow: @inj0shwetrust "hes throwing his bombs, his screens lighting up, hes mashing his buttons and hes saying push week" KEKW
[1:32:42] Shrenko: fresh economy, fresh lvling, fresh everything Kreygasm
[1:32:50] CritcobainTV: @luckfore dungeon finder? KEKW
[1:32:53] PToastman: Big assassin fan but it’s not the best
[1:32:58] bosen7: Yea, hopefully power is it’s up by patch
[1:32:59] MILESkg21: DUNGEON FINDER OMEGALUL
[1:32:59] BrothaLatinoHeat76: EXACTLY! FRESH NEW CAR SMELL :)
[1:33:00] inj0shwetrust: Thicc boss week right?
[1:33:02] lucid_wow: i think this is the first assa rogue ive seen in m+ since like bfa s4 when i played it lmao
[1:33:04] powmiaofficial: good st though
[1:33:08] Shalestorm: I'd appreciate the Classic XP buff more if i hadn't also recently had a Retail xp buff that has spoiled me down right rotten
[1:33:19] Tomka53: can't wait for df ass rogue
[1:33:24] luckfore: @Critcobain yea thats what added in wrath right?
[1:33:26] CritcobainTV: assass in m+ is definitely not the best lol
[1:33:33] Shrenko: ass rogue is fun because of bleeds
[1:33:33] queej01: i think assa rogue are gonna be strong in df
[1:33:36] lucid_wow: i played assa in m+ in bfa s4 and i dont think ive seen a single one since then its def the worst rogue spec for keys rn
[1:33:45] veroggo99: if it has the poisons icon then it is ass rogue
[1:33:46] CritcobainTV: They said they're not adding it, its been a big thing for months @luckfore
[1:33:48] TombStoneMercenary: dungeon finder is gone from Wrath folks
[1:33:49] veroggo99: :)
[1:33:50] tyler2tall89: assassin isnt bad in mythic, sub is just better
[1:33:54] tyler2tall89: and combat
[1:33:54] Timothious: level 20 mounts will be nice
[1:34:02] GamingDad77: the healer is doing more dmg...just sayin...
[1:34:04] AlphasaurusRexx: 5.7k dps says otherwise
[1:34:23] CodyKane: @Critcobain you going fresh or nah?
[1:34:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Any spec is fine for 15's if they play alright, any can do 20's if they play well
[1:34:24] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[1:34:26] CritcobainTV: assassination CAN do well, its just 10x more work for less dps than other specs
[1:34:28] lucid_wow: i think assa is gonna be strong in df but i think outlaw is gonna be the best rogue spec by a mile in df m+, already built really well for it plus restless crew and going from 5 targets to 8 is going to be nuts
[1:34:32] CritcobainTV: @CodyKane for a bit, not staying though
[1:34:36] luckfore: @Critcobain ive been out of the loop in terms of classic, so thats a bummer
[1:34:43] BrothaLatinoHeat76: OOOHHHHH The WotLK login screen is there :)
[1:34:49] Shalestorm: A lot
[1:34:53] ForgottenTime: its a single target fight he should be doing like 15+i guess hes just not good at sin lol
[1:34:55] EKS90_: every specc int he game can do a 20, if they play it well and know timings etc  Just some speccs are better at pushing than others.
[1:34:55] Herzenliegen: Cheaper flying
[1:34:58] ForgottenTime: yes you have been ablke to
[1:35:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are a ton of changes for Wrath, base flying going to 150% and dual spec are two of my faves
[1:35:06] ArcaneSyntax: every single class gets better lol
[1:35:06] Chobgob: are you gonna play WotLK? if so what are your plans?
[1:35:14] Shalestorm: looms
[1:35:15] lucid_wow: how fast is it to lvl in wotlk prepatch? kinda wanna do 58-70 on the warrior i boosted and then never played for tbc but idk how long its gonna take
[1:35:15] CodyKane: @Critcobain what sever, for you non fresh are you on?
[1:35:15] ArcaneSyntax: flying at 60, epic ground mounts at 40
[1:35:18] CritcobainTV: is my man even pressing buttons though? it's doing 1/3 the dps of the healer lol
[1:35:18] Molvonos: !wotlk
[1:35:19] Moobot: @Molvonos I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[1:35:23] CritcobainTV: @CodyKane benediction ally
[1:35:26] Timothious: !Fresh
[1:35:26] Moobot: @Timothious Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[1:35:34] AveragePvp: Does anyone know, did they confirm the experience required reduction, or is it just speculation still
[1:35:46] CodyKane: @Critcobain oh yah forgot you switched ally for the passives
[1:35:53] lucid_wow: i mean if u wanted to raid in wotlk u could probably raidlog on wotlk while still playing df
[1:35:57] Chobgob: paladin I assume?
[1:36:03] CritcobainTV: yeah just more friends over here
[1:36:13] ArcaneSyntax: I have to transfer my main from BCC, I'm stuck on benediction as horde
[1:36:16] Chobgob: Truth!
[1:36:20] mrmanno14: oh no Towel the Blood Elf sadge
[1:36:21] lucid_wow: best tank and healer plus top tier dps for the entire expansion
[1:36:25] c0mmander_starscream: Is Sloot going to play Wrath Classic?
[1:36:27] layyzguy: Towel, I just sent you a DM in discord.  It is what I sent to Origin PC this morning to help make sure you get proper credit when people buy one of their kick ass computers.
[1:36:29] lifetaker2424: what tank will you main in dragon?
[1:36:31] Jango_: at least feral is good in wrath
[1:36:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fated is *not* active for a world boss in retail. That's unfortch
[1:36:35] EKS90_: @luckfore they are doing a " modified dungeon finding tool" that is based on the dungeon finder addon from TBCC, cause " social structure of classic" would be ruined with dungeon finder, their words not mine
[1:36:43] Timothious: he gonna be a pretty boy elf
[1:36:49] PToastman: The rogue doesn’t have 4 piece if his armory is accurate
[1:36:56] MILESkg21: feral aint no joke in wrath
[1:36:57] Karnivor___: are you the most overpowered tank?
[1:36:59] procyon_mfc: Balance is insane also
[1:37:05] KingMarlin4: who?
[1:37:06] CritcobainTV: That's not foam KappaPride
[1:37:06] Adfecto: I think too many people sleeping on Disc Priest. I think there was issues with absorbs being calculated in healing back in wrath.
[1:37:11] procyon_mfc: moonkin gets mass aoe
[1:37:16] Herzenliegen: Is he even playing wrath?
[1:37:18] MILESkg21: Critcobain OMEGALUL Clap
[1:37:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Feral is tough to play well, but yes it has S-tier potential in PvE and PvP Wrath
[1:37:27] Thenickradice: feral in wrath and mop were pretty top notch
[1:37:29] alextheory_: !FRESH
[1:37:29] Moobot: @alextheoryguy Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[1:37:36] r0b928: So I’m confused with this wow classic stuff. Can we still play classic and BC classic when wrath comes out? Or are those done for?
[1:38:02] CritcobainTV: @Thenickradice are you forgetting cata? lmao, you literally just throw bleeds up, run and reset, and your bleeds nuked everything
[1:38:04] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:38:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: You'll see feral with a hysteria buff in raids doing sick damage
[1:38:09] lucid_wow: @Herzenliegen definitely, pretty sure hes been playing classic and tbc pretty steady its just streaming variety is better views for him so hes been doing it mostly off stream im pretty sure
[1:38:10] CritcobainTV: mastery op
[1:38:30] KShellZx: Blizz confirmed Maladeth is PVE: This is being corrected and should be resolved before realms come online later today.
[1:38:32] Thenickradice: @critcobain that's right. mastery was great in cata
[1:38:33] EKS90_: @r0b928 Season of mastery is there for classic, no idea how that will continue, but TBCC will go into wrath, no new fresh servers for tbc
[1:38:34] codemaker93: when is wotlk going live in US? in how many hours?
[1:38:36] CritcobainTV: It's Hersteria Kappa
[1:38:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, different name now

[1:40:08] bad_fish_too: All those fresh servers are going to be dead a month after wotlk release.
[1:40:09] Thenickradice: @critcobain I just remember mop a lot, because you could stealth, pop that ability that gave you 5 combo points, pop the finisher that gives increase damage (still all in stealth), then go off with incarnation and nature's vigil. unkillable burst damage
[1:40:49] Kainiee: do we have any info on when all 3 fated raids will be out at the same time?
[1:41:07] AlphasaurusRexx: @Kainiee after next week most likely

[1:43:02] BrothaLatinoHeat76: @MilesKG21 Man I hope so... I detest PvP servers
[1:43:07] lucid_wow: @Critcobain i could see a lot of streamers jumping on the fresh wave for content, lvling their dk on fresh then transferring off
[1:43:08] Crutchie: but you need a 55 on the server to make one
[1:43:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, there are plans of world domination

[2:04:52] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  they removed the reputation needs
[2:04:53] ForgottenTime: not long tbh
[2:04:55] Gillettefuzionz: They just removed rep requirements
[2:04:57] mmrghost7: does EU and NA prepatch happens at the same time ?
[2:05:01] dwolters_the_zombieman: just have to do quest line
[2:05:01] molo316: long enough for stock holders to be happy KEKW
[2:05:02] ArcaneSyntax: like zandalari requires loremaster of zandalar pretty much
[2:05:03] wazza76: Longmire is an awesome show!!

[2:05:12] NalinA: People are just lazy and dont wanna earn anything
[2:05:15] lucid_wow: i dont remember if u need to do war campaign at all for it but i dont think so
[2:05:15] Gillettefuzionz: a bunch of the stuff? Nope they only removed rep
[2:05:18] Timothious: Didn't the launcher say it will be down for another 6 hours
[2:05:26] Cheapshoty0uth: You need to do all the story zones for zandalari trolls. All the story in zuldazar etc
[2:05:43] acebrown24: is this wotlk
[2:05:53] lucid_wow: @acebrown24 yes
[2:06:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: GO GO GO
[2:06:06] Cheapshoty0uth: So for some classes it's easier. Some like Zandalari you still have to do main story quest for every horde zone in BFA @towelliee
[2:06:07] MILESkg21: POGGERS

[2:07:39] azirum: @cheapshoty0uth Oh yeah, took me maybe 1 to 1.5 hours. I unlocked them first.
[2:07:40] lucid_wow: im really really really excited to play sanctum of domination classic
[2:07:41] Cheapshoty0uth: they should just make it thay the embassy class unlocks for all allied races without needing achievements imo
[2:07:42] Shrenko: TBC Season of Mastery
[2:07:45] TheCliffyShow: @TheCliffyShow Don't you bad mouth those furry little angels.
[2:08:05] Cheapshoty0uth: @azirum Cool I know what I'm doing later than. Guess I'm gonna have to be a furry for now on my lock lol
[2:08:08] Timothious: I hope they don't make wrath go away if they do cata
[2:08:11] KrippsSecretsMiddleToe: @KrippsSecretsMiddleToe cheers
[2:08:31] lucid_wow: i think wrath is gonna be the end of classic
[2:08:36] Shrenko: Cata is 🐕 💩
[2:08:38] Aspectt10: nobody wants cata
[2:08:42] 0xnhil: cata had good raids
[2:08:42] warrenny: @timothious Honestly dont see cata happening
[2:08:44] the_bad_goat: classic wod would be a killer
[2:08:45] Timothious: great
[2:08:47] skymercii: MoP Classic pls
[2:08:48] moose_noodlez: They need to do legion classic
[2:08:52] Shanwerd: it takes so little investment for them to do cata rather than classic plus
[2:08:54] Hey_you_there: Shadowlands Classi Kappa
[2:08:54] powmiaofficial: asmongolds favorite expansion was cata
[2:08:54] ronny_84: I want cata classic
[2:08:54] r0b928: Hey I liked cata
[2:09:00] UltraKSlaya: Cata was awesome
[2:09:00] Shrenko: WOTLK + towCopium
[2:09:01] warrenny: Cata was alright
[2:09:03] EpicJune: true, even most private server go with Wrath
[2:09:04] Cheapshoty0uth: Every classic expansion has dropped in player base. I feel like Arthas is the perfect end to classic.
[2:09:08] Timothious: cata killed wow for me
[2:09:10] mrmanno14: Wrath +

[2:09:27] lucid_wow: they def wont do anything after wrath, cata was very unpopular, they're not gonna skip them, and wrath was basically the end of classic era/beginning of retail era
[2:09:35] Emirbt: i am waiting for Classic Shadowlands! it is gonna be amazing!
[2:09:36] azirum: @cheapshoty0uth They have the least requirements out of the A races. super easy. Just be careful and not get stuck on side quest. Wow heads guide helped a lot.
[2:09:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Cataclysm Reforged LUL
[2:09:39] ArcaneSyntax: cata is just retail light
[2:09:39] Shanwerd: i call expansions 1-3 wow1 4-6 wow2 and current wow wow3
[2:09:42] c0mmander_starscream: Draenor - Remastered
[2:09:43] signeddudu: Would you play a  1 year version of WOD for exemple? Just to enjoy the raids.
[2:09:43] Theliahh: cata was awesome
[2:09:45] mrmanno14: Wrath is super casual
[2:09:45] Wcvechten: what if they add in the cata dungeons/raids into the wrath, but keep them at 80 too, as a Wrath+ kinda thing
[2:09:47] blijex: I havent been up to date on whats going on. Classic WoW is still a thing correct? But now that Classic WotLK is coming out, Classic BC is going away?
[2:09:49] Phatori: Give me legion classic all day every day
[2:09:50] ArcaneSyntax: in DF cata is actually just worse retail
[2:09:50] sm1liey: @wEiRdO_dUdE oh god no
[2:09:51] Thoreya: cata had the highest subs in wows history. ppl forget
[2:09:52] Grymmson: I want Legion
[2:09:55] DeanoTV: they will probs keep wotlk and make seperate for MOP/legion
[2:09:55] giggachadwar: DF is Cata reforged
[2:09:55] lucid_wow: they wont skip cata, they wont do cata, and mop isnt really classic so i just dont think they do anything after wrath
[2:09:56] Truebass: Cata is remaster old 3 expansions yep
[2:09:59] bad_fish_too: I mean its free money for Bliz
[2:10:01] jaina8675309: do it with the cut suff put into it
[2:10:01] Cheapshoty0uth: They are putting the classic energy into drqgonflight from what I can tell
[2:10:04] PHYZIKS09: cata =  crap
[2:10:05] lucid_wow: @Thoreya wrath had the highest subs idk where ur getting cata from
[2:10:06] memnon94: they will just keep making new vanilla, TBC and wotlk servers, that's my guess
[2:10:06] UltraKSlaya: they should put custom  content in the classic servers . things that got cut
[2:10:06] KnsWoW: Theyre def. going to continue Classics
[2:10:08] 8bBattle: Classic up yet?
[2:10:12] Ordicos: how about bundling them together? doing cata and Mop together
[2:10:16] Shanwerd: skip cata do mop
[2:10:18] warrenny: Doesnt wrath still have weapon skill talent every level the standard rpg stuff tho?
[2:10:18] Honvar: @8bBattle No
[2:10:20] dwolters_the_zombieman: 1 thing i liked about WoD was hunters had a talent row where you could choose fire ammo, frost ammo and poison ammo
[2:10:22] crittinkitten: Its been ~10 years, no way it affects people perception of blizard or thier expansions
[2:10:22] Thoreya: @lucid_wow cata beginning had more than wrath
[2:10:24] DextrousSlime: Do you think they will eventually go through all expansions and then restart?
[2:10:33] Cheapshoty0uth: I'm not saying they won't do cata classic bit they shouldn't
[2:10:34] c_mcfeds: Have you already opened vaults
[2:10:37] tore522: why was cata seen as bad? everyone calls it bad but nevcer says why, or that "it wasnt lich king"
[2:10:37] azirum: we will probably get Classic Cata in 2024
[2:10:38] Blah206: LUL
[2:10:39] Sollice: He wants free wireless with his expansion purchase
[2:10:41] warrenny: @thoreya Because if wrath
[2:10:41] lucid_wow: wait was it cata beginning? i could have swore it was late wrath like icc era
[2:10:45] DoubleNova: buy 1 get 1
[2:10:46] JokaThS: just give us legion and we good plizzard
[2:10:48] crittinkitten: bundle them together over 4 years
[2:10:52] Theliahh: @tore522 it was just huge changes which scared a lot of folks
[2:10:58] bad_fish_too: @tore522 Nothing to do
[2:10:58] ArcaneSyntax: Zulga'deeznuts
[2:10:59] ItzBeardMan: WOTLK PLus plzzz
[2:11:02] Thoreya: @warrenny which still makes my point correct. lol
[2:11:02] catalyticflow: classic is pawn stars for WoW
[2:11:03] Cheapshoty0uth: There is no demand for cata classic
[2:11:12] Theliahh: I demand cata classic
[2:11:14] Cheapshoty0uth: Like are there even cata classic private servers?
[2:11:16] warrenny: @sollice Wow wireless? Painful
[2:11:19] lucid_wow: oh yeah i guess it was cata release with 12 mill my bad i thought it was late wrath
[2:11:25] emznev: are the servers down for US?
[2:11:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Arthaaaassssssss!!
[2:11:29] warrenny: @thoreya Eh maybe
[2:11:32] Cheapshoty0uth: Ruby Sanctum Kappa
[2:11:44] Shanwerd: demand for cata is low but cost is VERY low compared to developing new classic content
[2:12:00] Thoreya: i fucking hated cata, quit after like  a month
[2:12:07] Thoreya: they destroyed my favorite zone thousand needles
[2:12:10] Cheapshoty0uth: True the cost for classic can't be much so what's to stop them?
[2:12:11] Merzerker: any chance the servers come up early?
[2:12:12] warrenny: The revamp was mostly good
[2:12:13] Thoreya: so i pced out
[2:12:15] Ximora_and_Capy: 3pm can't come any quicker I tell ya LOL
[2:12:19] Theliahh: thousand needles in cata has a great quest line
[2:12:23] Honvar: @Merzerker Sure Kappa
[2:12:24] Cheapshoty0uth: Thousand needles boat still feels bad to this day
[2:12:34] Zapp_Brannigan86: Are you playing on the pvp or pve server @Towelliee ?
[2:12:37] SmallzzIV: @Towelliee do i gotta install TBC classic for the fresh server?
[2:12:38] Theliahh: thousand needles boat is my favorite KEKW
[2:12:41] lucid_wow: i wonder how many people disliked cata bc of the difficulty level tbh, i didnt play it but from what ive heard even the dungeons were harder than ever before and i believe that was when raids started getting much more mechanically intensive too
[2:12:42] warrenny: @thoreya Ikr old hillsbrad is epic too and barrens 😍
[2:12:43] Dankind64: KEKW oops
[2:12:52] Merzerker: @Honvar sadge
[2:12:52] bad_fish_too: Just off TBC they made a killing. My server has like 3k players or more on at any time of day.
[2:12:54] azirum: I enjoyed seeing Deathwing flying over a Zone.
[2:12:57] Theliahh: @lucid_wow yeah on launch heroics were way harder than tbc/wrath
[2:12:59] lucid_wow: only 2 deaths there thats wild
[2:13:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: A Classic Cataclysm would give a lot of people a chance to experience its progression for the first time, sure
[2:13:09] Cheapshoty0uth: I disliked the raid content in cata mostly. Deathwing final fight was kinda lame. Spine was good
[2:13:25] Theliahh: cata raids were good minus like half of dragon soul
[2:13:29] Theliahh: firelands is bis
[2:13:30] Zapp_Brannigan86: !Fresh
[2:13:30] Moobot: @Zapp_Brannigan86 Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.

[2:14:03] Mitune: No
[2:14:04] warrenny: @theliahh Isnt firelands generally high ranked?
[2:14:05] Cheapshoty0uth: Eh I disagree. I've never been the biggest fan of the remade firelands but people love it so I'm probably in minority
[2:14:05] Mitune: Kappa
[2:14:09] TompsonX: Holy Priest Kappa
[2:14:09] MrSnekyDino: Priest
[2:14:12] Shrenko: priest
[2:14:14] GoblinSniper55: @masonk95 6pm est
[2:14:17] Theliahh: @warrenny yeah firelands is awesome
[2:14:18] kessal: you playin g paladin?
[2:14:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: He's going mage for Fresh! LUL

[2:15:58] luckfore: damn yesterdays house of dragon episode had more viewers than the first episode which already set records
[2:16:02] Cheapshoty0uth: The Rag fight is my least favorite in firelands. Come to think of it there were some epic fights though. Was a strange time in my life that probably soured it for me.
[2:16:03] catalyticflow: they should make that yeti 450 mounts since they skipped it anyway
[2:16:14] Theliahh: @warrenny SOO was also a banger, I hope we get MoP classic one day

[2:17:20] TheCliffyShow: What mount?

[2:17:54] Kale_Nd: @Merzerker yes, once the pre-patch goes live on na
[2:17:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: people are buying tokens to prep for it
[2:17:58] thenomocexperience: Do you think Classic players ruined PVP servers for WotLK?
[2:17:58] Cheapshoty0uth: Lately I been struggling to find motivation to play. The new season honeymoon phase is over and I'm chasing an ilvl number. Nothing has any permanence so I find it hard to just grind fated and mythic plus for the next 3 months or so.
[2:18:01] Merzerker: interesting they havent had any PR about it
[2:18:11] furrythighs: Zerg it
[2:18:12] Masqerader: rogue shroud?

[2:19:24] Ayemis: will my addons be ready to go on wrath fresh?
[2:19:25] Cheapshoty0uth: @ebonhawkes I know but I just came back for season 4. Might do some mount and tranmog stuff.
[2:19:38] strike879: that part is one of the few things that get me pissed off
[2:20:07] lucid_wow: watching some ppl do that section is so funny
[2:20:07] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW

[2:20:54] lucid_wow: thats why u bring a warlock
[2:21:01] lucid_wow: then u only need 3 ppl total if the warlock can get through
[2:21:01] Ayemis: i have my classic ones from tbc ready to go @queban_305
[2:21:03] Timothious: The launcher automatically patches for wrath doesn't it
[2:21:06] Orion280: it's so easy tho
[2:21:13] Jonesyy_xz: Should I go shadow priest or warrior for wotlk classic?
[2:21:20] Masqerader: @lucid_wow tried that other day, the lock summon didn't work
[2:21:22] zeitgeiz: Venthyr just tele through it
[2:21:25] Utmost777: it is easy compared to the one in the snake temple... if you have any desync you can't get through that
[2:21:36] bad_fish_too: @Ayemis Ohhh. Then they should
[2:21:43] strike879: because its easy its so frustrating and because you get pissed off it only gets harder
[2:21:44] Nazzguul: @Masqerader You cant summon people in workshop anymore
[2:21:54] jaalexba: @Jonesyy_xz Both:  Start with your warrior first.
[2:21:55] lucid_wow: @UtmostOwnage u mean the lightning bridge?
[2:21:56] derry10: the maze is really easy with the Door of Shadows ability

[2:22:26] ForgottenTime: yup
[2:22:33] lucid_wow: you can warrior leap it too if u have the right timing
[2:22:36] CritcobainTV: 1k
[2:22:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep, 1000g
[2:22:38] NovaSynth: 1000g
[2:22:41] TheUnknowing: probably going to be 100
[2:22:42] Theliahh: it was 1k in wrath
[2:22:43] Kale_Nd: 1000g
[2:22:44] RagingPunk: god wish it was 100 lol
[2:22:45] lucid_wow: its really finnicky tho for the warrior leap
[2:22:48] Bigtrollowski: how long left until pre patch?
[2:22:50] catalyticflow: 1000g but you only have t paynonce
[2:22:52] allen_rh: whats the best dps in wotlk
[2:22:52] Bloodrave120: how are we feeling about alpha? 8 out of 10
[2:22:56] Utmost777: @lucid_wow yeah, and the spinning parts before it
[2:22:58] Tripl3dot: this bridge is ass
[2:23:01] a_demeaning_cow: 1000g got cheeper in Cata pre patch
[2:23:03] NoorOnline: Going to give the new sky fury server a go
[2:23:04] Masqerader: @Nazzguul tried it other day, when we tried to summon the person, it said "you can't do that here"
[2:23:26] zeitgeiz: Won’t be playing wrath, no gold going in and don’t even have an epic flying mount. Crazy how gold focused classics have been
[2:23:28] ezxema: !fresh
[2:23:28] Moobot: @ezxema Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[2:23:41] NovaSynth: Deluxe edition was data mined.
[2:23:44] Cheapshoty0uth: I'm gonna go finish these last two episodes of westworld than go for a 20 mile bike ride. BBL when servers are hopefully up
[2:23:44] Nazzguul: Yeah, they want people to navigate through the bots
[2:24:18] Kasvot_Vaxt: will the fresh peeps be able to transfer out eventually
[2:24:19] a_demeaning_cow: @zeitgeiz that’s the purpose of fresh servers for those who have not been playing or want a fresh start
[2:24:21] lucid_wow: wait do u kill the shield gen now?
[2:24:29] NoorOnline: @towelliee why maladath instead of Skyfury?
[2:24:29] the_general01: squirrels
[2:24:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Was the priest using squirrels? LUL
[2:24:31] Mister_Ript: Mind control the squirrels?
[2:24:37] lucid_wow: ohhh that makes sense
[2:24:46] lucid_wow: i remember using the shield gen to live the giga wallop in 8.3
[2:24:49] mitchumtx: well i dont have to be at work till 10am Thursday! Let the WOTLK GRIND BEGIN! Got my AdvancedGG ready!
[2:24:58] bad_fish_too: Damn forgot it was 1k. Glad I farmed gold lol.
[2:25:17] Cheapshoty0uth: My theory on the gold/economy is that the end game for classic isn't hard so they need some sort of artifical difficulty gap to make people feel like they accomplished something. That's why speedruns exist etc
[2:25:26] N3llee: bots are looking to cash in huge
[2:25:38] lucid_wow: i kinda wanna play wotlk but im kinda worried bc i didnt really play classic or tbc at all so i have no gold and no gear going into it so i feel like im too far behind already
[2:25:46] Kasvot_Vaxt: port bots, enchant bots
[2:25:48] r0b928: What’s gdkp
[2:25:51] N3llee: the bot farmers run gdkps
[2:25:55] bad_fish_too: Dungeon farms. But that gor hammered with the boosting nerf.
[2:26:00] MysticalOS: that's exactly how. the gold they are making funds those gdkp because those are users buying gold
[2:26:01] Kasvot_Vaxt: tbf the bot situation has actually gotten a lot better
[2:26:02] pk99: all the people who "can't wait for fresh" then buying gold LuL
[2:26:03] Timothious: just start on the fresh server
[2:26:03] 0xnhil: gdkps should be banned
[2:26:03] N3llee: take 30% cuts
[2:26:04] jaalexba: The deluxe edition will carry them through the 4th quarter LUL
[2:26:07] NoorOnline: @lucid_wow play on one of the fresh servers coming out today.
[2:26:07] Cheapshoty0uth: @lucid_wow That's why bots make money. They want people like you to purchase gold.
[2:26:18] DrWafflesaurus: They updated maladath - it's "normal" now
[2:26:23] RatDevil: Hello folks

[2:27:23] CrunkyBrewster: Original Wrath had em as well
[2:27:23] Cheapshoty0uth: Hmm I might be tempted to try it. But then what if the server dies?
[2:27:25] Kasvot_Vaxt: do you have to level a char to unlock dk on fresh?
[2:27:25] Mozzeyy_: @lucid_wow u realise ppl stared wow in the og wotlk as well? They didnt have gold or gear

[2:34:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: To get a DK on fresh, people have to level to 55. That's the big race
[2:34:30] ArcaneSyntax: the tuskarr throws saronite bombs when you engage the lich king
[2:34:34] Masqerader: all this fresh talk, we gonna get in-game advertisement for hello fresh

[2:36:42] bad_fish_too: Inscriptionists about to make a killing
[2:36:43] CrunkyBrewster: just wondering. little neverous LUL
[2:36:46] luckfore: would have been nice if they also opened a few TBC fresh servers for people who wanna play that instead
[2:36:53] CrunkyBrewster: ah okay yeah that makes sense
[2:37:00] Odapain: do we still need to do raid attunements or can we run sunwell ect without needing too in pre patch ?
[2:37:10] Rudric_Ice: finally no more retail WoW
[2:37:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: there are no attunements in tbc at this time
[2:37:18] auschad: why would you be nervous, prepatch is today and wrath launches in a month
[2:37:18] Abrakadunk: anyone else have the "Update available" in launcher, but when update is clicked get "can't update while playing" error?
[2:37:28] Kinghorn: no tbc raids have attunements
[2:37:30] CritcobainTV: I've been pre prepping showers. 3 times a day for the last week. doing that until  wotlk launch. This way i can go full Degen but i don't fall behind on showers
[2:37:31] Biorrwolf: Kinda sad Skyfury is West Coast
[2:37:33] bad_fish_too: Sunwell is nerfed for prepatch too
[2:37:38] Kinghorn: and I think wotlk gets rid of all the vanilla attunements

[2:42:20] Vile_: You need a level 55 character to make a DK on a server.
[2:42:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: @allen_rh Fresh servers require a level 55 before making a DK, but on regular servers we can make DK's once maintenance is done

[2:51:49] Coffenatic: D:
[2:51:56] zenkodac: yea, i'm just gona level a druid to 55 and then restart a dk
[2:52:00] Shanwerd: 90 days is still a lot of fun

[2:52:19] Jarless: fresh will be full until wotlk release
[2:52:20] TacDuc: I refuse to believe that the Shaman was named Shamtowel, it was Shametowel, and you can't change my mind, even with proof
[2:52:24] zenkodac: like clasic has 4 years of people botting gold and then using them in gkps
[2:52:25] N3llee: literally dont know a single person playing fresh

[2:52:30] Ayemis: 90s days of fun is alot in todays add gaming world
[2:52:31] GamingDad77: @Ludiaro on fresh servers
[2:52:39] SilkeySmooth: they got to pay for their gdkps
[2:52:42] Timothious: why would they let you make a 55 right off on fresh
[2:52:54] Timothious: would defeat the purpose
[2:52:55] agentblaster123: What about the none fresh servers ?
[2:52:58] Jawis: yeah instant 55 wouldn't make sense tbh
[2:52:58] bumudur: so I'm new to classic release cycle, what should I do to start for wotlk? should I go for a fresh server or an existing one?
[2:53:00] grylz89: fresh will extremely fun for a month or so, then . definitely going back to my mains on benediction
[2:53:00] bigshovels: do they have the wrath abilities once live?
[2:53:01] SargeAF: Hopefully they will see after 90 days they wont need to allow boosts/transfers on the fresh because then it defeats the purpose of "fresh"
[2:53:03] kembogam3s: and aint no one gonna do that or will tyhey
[2:53:08] Samah101: yes

[2:53:40] N3llee: 55 on a server is standard across fresh and non fresh
[2:53:41] cannibalcanyon: free for all
[2:53:44] UHREG: no need to have lvl 55 only on fresh
[2:53:47] Jawis: you also can't use the boost on fresh after you reached 68 with a different character, right?
[2:53:49] SonofHorus82: you can just make one on regular servers. no 55 needed. You can only have 1 per realm and to make a second then you have to have a 55 on that realm. the first one is free though.
[2:53:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: After you make your "free" DK then you need level 55's to make them
[2:53:51] fbirobertmueller805: @towelliee what if they dmca video games? What would content creators do then?

[3:00:21] Masqerader: dead on venture atm
[3:00:25] mitchumtx: wowwwww
[3:00:26] TheCliffyShow: I remember getting into some big PvP battles around some big docks in Vol'dun.
[3:00:28] GravelyOnTime: I think PVP was actually split/weakened in MoP
[3:00:28] mitchumtx: the teabag
[3:00:29] Shanwerd: there is so many good pvp games to waste time doing it in wow
[3:00:30] soge131: !freah

[3:00:36] micronetic_one: teabagging LUL
[3:00:38] Biorrwolf: Wow! That's their opinion!
[3:00:38] Vendralos: World PvP is pretty cringe honestly
[3:00:39] GamingDad77: @HonestPhilosophy I remember those! good times. now all you get is maybe one or two unkillable horde walking arou stormwind
[3:00:42] Eregbueye: hey man you looking cute today
[3:00:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: The PvP subscriptions are real money, they can't totally ignore it
[3:00:44] Pacsunnnn: is therea build today or are you focusing on wrath
[3:00:47] godamomg: pvp is fun its look like fun private servers
[3:00:51] futomara01: report him for teabagging
[3:00:52] Herzenliegen: Look at this guy
[3:00:52] oOQuanixOo: warlock ninja looted ashbringer from staysafe on last day to do naxx yesterday
[3:00:57] TheUnknowing: I pvped a lot in cata, havent pvped much since
[3:00:57] GravelyOnTime: MoP had the big pvp stats and stuff - but after that they got rid of them.
[3:00:59] UltraKSlaya: Tolbarad was fun
[3:01:02] IndyKnows: I did the most PVP with arcane mage in Cata spam running battlegrounds and wpvp all day
[3:01:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would love to see that data
[3:01:08] Biorrwolf: @towelliee are you going Horde on Fresh? Because I need a community :c
[3:01:08] Shrenko: look at the loser pala
[3:01:11] H0lydiver: only do pvp/bgs, all ppl i know left and cant stand pugs in mythic +
[3:01:11] MaceBTW: i think vanilla pvp is decent but not retail
[3:01:15] SSD511_: What he doing LUL
[3:01:17] EmpathyLiveChat: aww
[3:01:18] manmower: it would be bigger if they put in some work on it
[3:01:18] Zomgboy: on my server there's this guy camping low lvls in freewind post for weeks
[3:01:18] Shanwerd: you could say the same about raids
[3:01:21] Thewunk: @Towelliee whats your bitrate for your stream? just wondering
[3:01:25] r0b928: Pvp has always been a secondary thing that is just there imo
[3:01:26] nokster: its so small BECAUSE they ddint put any effort
[3:01:26] Bloodrave120: all the pvp people raging right now
[3:01:30] Endofdreams: massive barrier to entry is why
[3:01:33] Faerlynn: That paladin is such a sad person
[3:01:34] TacDuc: PvP is not that exciting when some people just have so much higher Ilvl than you just stomp your duo
[3:01:37] Epidoral: @Towelliee Did you go back to alliance now that it's cross factions ?
[3:01:37] Neziko: @Shanwerd OOOOOOOOOF
[3:01:38] Bucktroo: @Towelliee Maybe with the Spellbreak guys coming onboard for PvP?
[3:01:38] Derized_: tbf, that could be a result of them alienating it.
[3:01:40] manmower: it's one of the big 3 systems, they probably have plans to support it
[3:01:41] a_confused_cyborg: It being a tiny portion of their community that actually raids is similar
[3:01:42] snakester2010: wotlk was last of the good world pvp and cata was the last xpac for quality pvp (the funnest) IMO
[3:01:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: The raids are the biggest endgame feature, but actual participation it not that high
[3:01:53] Bloodrave120: pvp sucks in wow, face it
[3:01:58] micronetic_one: LUL that pala, I can't
[3:02:01] Endofdreams: pvp should just be equalized gear where you can pick your stats...like lostark or GW2
[3:02:02] IndyKnows: Raid and Mythic plus is what carries the game long term imo
[3:02:05] Herzenliegen: When they made all servers pve world pvp died.
[3:02:10] saevenar: raid participation is super low especially this expansion
[3:02:12] SilkeySmooth: yet people find it hard to get in a m+ group but random bgs are always popping
[3:02:12] manmower: do more people pvp than mythic raid?
[3:02:15] mitchumtx: that paladin really thinking he doing something LUL
[3:02:16] godamomg: pvp is fun its look like fun private servers

[3:02:26] cothxd: @Herzenliegen bfa would like a talk
[3:02:28] ForgottenTime: you said small degenerate group wrong KEKW
[3:02:30] Domini1001: @Towelliee  Towel bro atm if you play WoW you are in a small portion of people that syill playing it
[3:02:31] snakester2010: @allenh93 mop was shit.
[3:02:33] 0xnhil: @Towelliee and people who want to get into pvp in wow are gatekept by the small minority who do pvp kek
[3:02:34] MVRD: so what are you trying to tell
[3:02:34] Milanesa_De_Pollo: We need Solo queue for rated BG's, they are dead otherwise
[3:02:36] Thewunk: Hey @Towelliee Whats your video bitrate for your live streams? just wondering
[3:02:39] net_mi: BFA world pvp was fun
[3:02:39] Aidler: pvp in raids… that would be a great idea…lol Kappa
[3:02:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rated solo shuffle can be a good thing for PvPers
[3:02:44] Orcan3: Would be funny if you could queue for a 1-15m+ key
[3:02:47] TheCliffyShow: You are the chosen one!
[3:02:47] CrunkyBrewster: M+ is Dodge Ball Selection really LUL but it's not that bad at the lower keys at least. I had no issues getting groups

[3:18:47] Orcan3: I didnt even know that Crowfall lauched a year after the fact
[3:18:50] NoorOnline: I’ve never even heard of crowfall

[3:19:01] KrippsSecretsMiddleToe: Someone misclicked... :D

[3:19:03] XshadowturkeyX: i was hyped for crowfall, played the beta hit w/e the max lvl was and it needed alot of work still and they launched how it was in beta , so sad
[3:19:06] sawyeruk83: !fresh
[3:19:12] Jarlan23: arent they making a new star wars mmo too
[3:19:12] captain_khyzan: Sadly i dont think much will come of Ashes... to long of development time, will be outdated and overshadowed by time it launches
[3:19:12] Broomba: we got a sneak peak
[3:19:14] QQisLIVE: They just testing the template :P
[3:19:14] remers: is it known what the wrath upgrade is going to include

[3:19:28] Repozer: Repozer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 69 months! 
[3:19:29] traviiz: Someone asked in a tweet about subscription to ghostcrawler and he replied "We haven’t shared this yet, but philosophically it will look like other Riot games"
[3:19:31] snakester2010: @captain_khyzan i mean diablo 2 to diablo 3 took 11 years lol
[3:19:32] aumixp: @towelliee the mount is in the mount journal
[3:19:43] HairyAreolaus: Even worse than Wildstars launch
[3:19:46] maccaruso: I'm gonna say noon pst
[3:19:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep
[3:19:57] albrownn: when tbc came released, servers weren't live until like 5pm central lol
[3:20:00] IthuleTwitch: Crowfall was a scam.  Todd Coleman thought he could keep delaying the launch and sell it like he did with Shadowbane to Sony.  When he couldn't do it he sold it off to a mobile game dev and bailed
[3:20:07] manmower: happened to WoW
[3:20:10] Jarlan23: spies monkaS
[3:20:12] captain_khyzan: @snakester2010 but thats a triple A name.... ashes is not, it has 0 brand to build off

[3:20:56] uglla3np: never say never
[3:20:58] Orcan3: WoW 2 POGGERS
[3:21:00] Honvar: That sounds unreal :)
[3:21:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like UE5, but that takes longer for development
[3:21:09] Derized_: Have you seen that throne and liberty game yet? 10 years of development KEKW
[3:21:11] MILESkg21: so you're saying theres a chance
[3:21:14] procyon_mfc: wow has always been about cartoony timeless graphics.
[3:21:15] riley_poker: be on WOW w before it though
[3:21:16] Nokterian: NEVAH
[3:21:17] Theliahh: unreal is a terrible engine for an MMO KEKW
[3:21:27] snakester2010: @captain_khyzan yeah but people still play new world lol. i dont think ashes will be DoA if they release a finished game. it has a lot of draw to it. i think people just like to bandwagon hate cause theyre impatient
[3:21:28] PokerFaceMoose: never say never, but never
[3:21:29] procyon_mfc: WoW isn't aiming for realistic graphics
[3:21:30] net_mi: UE is for indie companies
[3:21:37] barrowzz: unreal 5 would make WOW look crazzzyyyy but not a lot of people would be able to play due to hardware limitations
[3:21:37] Nokterian: NUHU NO NOPE NEVAH LUL
[3:21:39] happybooger: i would probably stop playing WoW if it wen to UE5
[3:21:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: ashes will be a month from launch when unreal 6 gets announced then ashes announces a delay to redevelop for unreal 6 Kappa
[3:21:41] Aidler: wow has no need for realistic graphics. it has his own style
[3:21:42] MILESkg21: literally anything is better than what its currently using
[3:21:43] r0b928: Do you think WoW will ever be a console game?
[3:21:48] duffluv22: Greatest Coach EVER!!!!
[3:21:52] Gygaxx: @Towelliee Hearthstone uses Unity Engine.
[3:21:52] Orcan3: WoW will also never shut down, it just goes f2p (ditto)
[3:21:56] gronnlir: @Towelliee i think it would be dope if they use classic to go completely away from what they have done with wow (they could use like an alternate time line excuse)
[3:21:58] umamiyami: !fresh
[3:21:59] Moobot: @roffelnderrolf Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[3:22:03] aumixp: @towelliee that leak a couple weeks ago said today is the day for wotlk stuff so one more right for the leaker
[3:22:05] Tiamarilien: at this point it would cost them too much to replace their engine
[3:22:06] AstroCaptain: Sure Ion-middle-of-the-fence Hazzikostas might never say never, but come on... Don't be daft. WOW 2 will never happen, and Unreal Engine would be too restrictive for WOW/FFXIV
[3:22:10] Purgatan: Why would they change the engine, I haven’t found another mmo that feels as good from a gameplay perspective.
[3:22:15] Jarlan23: isnt it full of spaghetti with stuff they cant do
[3:22:19] MILESkg21: have u tried doing a simple BG and not lagging out
[3:22:20] Loktow: It's got what's important
[3:22:22] snakester2010: @captain_khyzan besides.. we probably need another 5 gens of graphic cards just to run the game LUL
[3:22:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Wildstar still looks good, too, and I expect Riot to go with a similar look
[3:22:31] dracullus: there were serious lags in BfA but currently it's so much better
[3:22:35] Orcan3: The only thing they cant fix is apparently the lags when there are a lot of people on the screen.. worldbosses and big pvp sucks.
[3:22:38] chill_xf: do u think blizzard will create a mmo on unreal engine 5 ?
[3:22:39] NVbrutal: dont fix what isnt broken.
[3:22:40] Theliahh: @Jarlan23 all software is fully of spaghetti
[3:22:42] Loktow: Is wildstar still playable?
[3:22:45] mrmanno14: idk why but every time i compstomp my team loses
[3:22:48] Chill_Ninja: Chill_Ninja subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[3:23:04] Wcvechten: Southshore vs Tarren Mill is a lag fiesta
[3:23:14] Kakotan2143: IF WoW went to Unreal engine, a lot of the "poor" WoW players wouldnt be able to run it on their current system, EVEN the new Dragonflight is upping the system min requirements. AM I right @Towelliee ?
[3:23:18] Gillettefuzionz: wish it was :'(
[3:23:22] Aidler: @loktow I think someone is making a wildstar private server
[3:23:23] Jarlan23: shadowlands tuesdays were fucking awful too
[3:23:25] xhaven: I gotta say going back to Boralus from Oribos is such a huge differnce makes me hopefull for DF
[3:23:33] MILESkg21: just tell the "poors" to upgrade them potatoes Kappa
[3:23:39] Rudric_Ice: should i download BC classic cuz i dont see wrath classic on my launcher
[3:23:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: True, the hardware requirements would go way up
[3:23:47] Kakotan2143: YEP
[3:23:50] Loktow: @Aidler that's cool. I wouldn't mind trying it again for a few minutes
[3:23:55] bad_fish_too: Doing towers in Terrokar on Faerlina is la lagfest.
[3:23:57] r0b928: I wish I had a computer to be able to play WoW
[3:23:58] Kakotan2143: Get money where they can
[3:23:59] Crutchie: @Rudric_Ice yes
[3:24:04] Loktow: the only problem with WoW is CPU bottlenecking
[3:24:05] MILESkg21: play on a smart fridge
[3:24:06] Nokterian: Its like DOOM that can run on a toaster
[3:24:07] Broomba: @Rudric_Ice bc classic becomes wrath classic

[3:24:28] cahoots82: @Loktow WS private server is out there. I don't know if dungeons/raids are working but you can level, combat, etc.
[3:24:31] luckfore: atleast wow supports multi threading now lol
[3:24:37] SethBrowning: Wow does sweeping engine updates almost every expansion
[3:24:38] snakester2010: @Nokterian good ol floppy disk doom
[3:24:45] JMAC14: didn't they improve the graphics
[3:24:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoW was pretty quick with working nice in 4K, and with ray tracing
[3:24:46] GamingDad77: I7-2700 / GTX 1050....still 60 fps solid
[3:24:46] Kakotan2143: YEP
[3:24:47] Holysal: theres a top m+ player that plays on a mac for 2010 LUL

[3:25:11] Nokterian: i was happy when in 8.1 finally using 4 cores instead of 1 of the cpu @Towelliee
[3:25:12] rjb11022: I don’t like FF14 engine it’s the only reason I don’t play it

[3:25:49] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Unironically, Rift was another MMO that was pretty fluid like WoW

[3:33:30] Nokterian: he was sniped in FFXIV as well
[3:33:30] Cal_Kat: open world PVP is not pvp, people only due it to gank and have advantage. Reason servers so 1 sided, people won't fight unless got advantage and true pvp'ers do instanced.
[3:33:31] Masqerader: "we gonna run this serveR"  he got ass blasted
[3:33:34] Manferno: @Zilberg *at least 4 1/2 hours

[3:34:00] SSD511_: I’m so frustrated if someone gank me while I’m leveling LUL
[3:34:06] rjb11022: @masqerader was more satire. He knew it was coming but it was the streamer server and all his friends were there
[3:34:06] MaceBTW: @spookychefkarolina small brains
[3:34:08] molymonade: are you doing a guild? if so, is it sub only ?
[3:34:08] Molvonos: @undeadrogue_ Sure, i'll one shot you.  Watch.

[3:34:25] cahoots82: @spookychefkarolina Idk how people who go around killing bobs for fun don't eventually get bored
[3:34:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: The worst on a PvE server is that someone kills your quest mobs or quest NPC, and that doesn't happen much
[3:34:31] MILESkg21: rogue is great in wrath
[3:34:32] rjb11022: @allen_rh awesome

[3:34:44] bad_fish_too: Rogues pump in wrath
[3:34:45] Nokterian: Been lone wolf for sometime in retail and i dont mind

[3:35:04] givmeafrekinname: Watch Bajheera if you want pvp. Great guy.
[3:35:08] Molvonos: Cross faction aint bad, Alliance smell funny  tho

[3:49:55] Zomgboy: it feels to me as if WOTLK is the last classic? perhaps cata... but yeah
[3:49:57] stallowned: its true towCopium
[3:49:57] Molvonos: slootMask slootBA
[3:50:02] Copsonson: Servers update now?
[3:50:05] MILESkg21: no chance that we get cata classic LuL
[3:50:06] Crutchie: i cant wait for shadowlands classic Kappa
[3:50:07] Biorrwolf: Remasters in general are a big issue in gaming right now
[3:50:09] death_cam_: cant wait for ppl to be hyped on classic wod xd
[3:50:10] Templexx: ah yes nalak farming while we waait
[3:50:12] yamammotto: so what? kill me that i don't like retail
[3:50:16] TweektheProphet: I can't wait for Dragon flight classic
[3:50:22] Frank4LuLz: wow is a money making machine, microsoft will never turn it off, more classic plaease
[3:50:24] yzino1992: I'd love MoP classic just due to class design being on top but then again already sick of all the content in it xD
[3:50:30] Zilberg: MilesKG21 We definitely will

[3:50:35] cothxd: wod wasnt a bad expansion. just lacked content
[3:50:38] Blah206: Legion Classic is gonna be based
[3:50:41] Kelsillium: just add every dungeon in wow to M+ and i'll be happy
[3:50:42] Nuerologicz: cataclysm started it all imo. the new talent trees were a insane. disbelief from players
[3:50:49] Nightmareo: Is the only fresh server for WotLK classic on west coast? no East Coast servers?
[3:50:53] soge131: CataClassic, love the name
[3:50:53] Aro725: cata would be sick, I would love it
[3:50:55] 91Niki: Some people just don't get it will never be the same as the first time you played. The towCopium is realy
[3:50:57] Frank4LuLz: waiting for MOP, have all my items saved for transmog...lol
[3:50:57] Zilberg: No shot Blizzard stops at Cata ... They will call it Cata remastered
[3:50:59] Diamondead1: Warmane is still on
[3:51:01] SlickyNick44: Ulduar was way too short in retail
[3:51:03] Neowanderer: i dont see cata classic it will stop with wraith
[3:51:07] YENqtx: copium new expansion after wrath
[3:51:08] manmower: m+ in wrath
[3:51:13] moshujsg: Do you think they might do a new expansion to wrath isntead of cata?
[3:51:16] GamingDad77: especially if they time gate it like before
[3:51:18] MaceBTW: i dont want catablizzm
[3:51:24] Nuerologicz: ngl most people are gonna be bored for launch. MOST people remember wrath in the ICC days
[3:51:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Adjusting the progression curve is interesting
[3:51:30] Aro725: Yeah that ilvl squish sounds terrible imo. You went back to ulduar anyways for valanyr and trinkets
[3:51:34] Autoexeq: Gearscore Kreygasm
[3:51:37] Nuerologicz: and ICC isnt for awhile
[3:51:38] Revoca: alternate wrath time line ... and then add it as a dungeon / chrome tim event in retail
[3:51:41] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @Towelliee why didn't they replace the 10/25 man in Wrath Classic with flex raid like in retail normal/heroic?
[3:51:46] Squirrel_nutty: fuk gearscore
[3:51:46] Zilberg: I just wanna see Deathwing flying over a zone again killing everyone @Towelliee Kreygasm
[3:51:51] captain_khyzan: OMG GUYS just think "Shadowlands Classic" omg cant wait!
[3:51:55] TheCliffyShow: They are going to add in content so the Jailer stuff actually makes sense.
[3:52:05] Crutchie: wrath was my favorite expansion
[3:52:08] LiveFromStua: Wrath servers up when?
[3:52:09] Frank4LuLz: BFA classic....BIS
[3:52:19] Aro725: trusting blizzard to balance the tiersets after squishing the ilvl will be KEKW I think the class balance will be pretty scuffed
[3:52:23] Gillettefuzionz: was so good for everyone
[3:52:24] gameofboars: @LiveFromStua 3 PM PDT
[3:52:26] Frank4LuLz: 3pm - 8pm....maybe
[3:52:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: No spending weeks on attunements
[3:52:28] yamammotto: not hard modes on raids
[3:52:31] Kulture1: i remember spamming heroic dungeons
[3:52:33] Nuerologicz: you just.... played the game. Imagine that LMAO
[3:52:35] zeagoonbag: its made me come back to play casual for first time in 6 years
[3:52:35] captain_khyzan: nah all about the shadowlands classic! gah i cant wait
[3:52:37] GamerGoat56: @towelliee how long will it take to get a dk from 58 to 70?
[3:52:40] yamammotto: dungeons were easy as hell
[3:52:43] AveragePvp: Fated wrath raids at the end
[3:52:47] LiveFromStua: @gameofboars Thanks :)
[3:52:49] jeneraljelly: wotlk heroics are a complete meme
[3:53:01] Uthfar: probably late to the party 😂 any ideas when classic goes live
[3:53:02] Timothious: aI would rewrite the story to where arthas didnt die and take it from there
[3:53:09] Bearatello: now it will take longer to find a group
[3:53:10] Weirdfractio: fat
[3:53:21] Masqerader: because they "want the social aspect"
[3:53:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Spend more time just traveling to the dungeon LUL
[3:53:30] Frank4LuLz: woke devs think they do , but they dont
[3:53:31] Phatori: How decent geared can you get running just heroics in wrath? What’s the power lvl difference between those and raid gear? @towelliee
[3:53:35] Nuerologicz: Theorycrafting also became mainstream in Wrath.
[3:53:40] Neowanderer: did they leave all the badges for loot in wraith classic?
[3:53:59] GQadams: what you think of the GDKP/boosting culture classic is now?
[3:54:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: The meta snobbery will be awful
[3:54:05] AllenzoTV: @Phatori i believe raid gear was 264 ilvl, heroics was like 200 ilvl
[3:54:08] CuresEighty: so there will be a lfg tool from day 1 in wrath?
[3:54:09] benguino: oooh gear score returns
[3:54:10] Neowanderer: its gonna be a shitshow
[3:54:14] bad_fish_too: LFG Bulletin Board is a good addon
[3:54:18] Manjoe81: just go tank or heals
[3:54:19] captain_khyzan: all right @Towelliee we know you got that blizzard ties, let people spoke, we want shadowlands classic!
[3:54:23] Neowanderer: gearscore was big thing even back then
[3:54:28] pk99: Gearscore check for Archavon KEKW
[3:54:28] Phatori: @allenzotv ahh tu
[3:54:31] Phatori: Ty*
[3:54:33] jeneraljelly: just run with your guild
[3:54:34] LTxMkilla: Agreed
[3:54:36] Zilberg: Need AOTC Classic achievements Kappa
[3:54:39] Aro725: #nochanges, cant trust them to not fuck it up
[3:54:43] LiveFromStua: Gearscore, realm first level 80, pay the group leader 50 gold and maybe you'll get a group LUL
[3:54:49] Thewunk: !fresh
[3:54:50] Moobot: @Thewunk Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[3:54:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's like with warrior tanks in Wrath....most will do fine, but they will be turned down regularly for groups because they are not meta
[3:54:54] BfAleTitan: wrath was the only classic i was looking forward to playing, they changed that lol
[3:55:06] Punk611: I don't understand how making instance content harder to get started will make world content feel better. if nothing is in the world it means nothing.
[3:55:06] TheGiant99: @jeneraljelly shouldn't need guild to run dungeon
[3:55:15] SSD511_: My wrath experience was que bgs and wintergrasp LUL
[3:55:19] Zilberg: Nah force them
[3:55:21] cothxd: holly killed everquest TLPS
[3:55:24] cothxd: doing same to WoW
[3:55:26] Tharia: 100%
[3:55:27] saevenar: dungeon finder let about half the classes actually make it into heroics
[3:55:28] Blah206: lol
[3:55:30] jeneraljelly: @TheGiant99 then dont complain about not having a group i guess idk
[3:55:38] Kulture1: i wonder how wintergrasp will be with one sided servers
[3:55:44] CrunkyBrewster: EXACTLY
[3:55:45] obbi87: !FRESH
[3:55:45] Moobot: @obbi87 Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[3:55:47] Zilberg: Noone ever talks in WOW now and it makes me sad
[3:55:48] 91Niki: People don't know how to talk to each other unless they're arguing these days LUL
[3:55:54] CrunkyBrewster: that is what i wanna do!! LUL
[3:55:55] twinkiefatsack: twinkiefatsack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 105 months, currently on a 105 month streak! towHAMUP
[3:55:55] abracka_: i honestly want to know where they got "we listened to the community and we are NOT putting in the LFD tool"
[3:55:56] Zilberg: ^
[3:56:03] MaceBTW: are you ouf of touch? ive made more friends in classic than i have in 10 years of retail
[3:56:05] CrunkyBrewster: I have friends. I dont need Internet friends
[3:56:08] spookychefkarolina: LUL LUL the last thing I ever want to be during my personal time, is social.
[3:56:14] bad_fish_too: tbc dungeons are pretty easy to get into now. Prob 5 mins max for a group.
[3:56:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[3:56:15] happybooger: @91Niki thats not true! LUL
[3:56:17] TheCliffyShow: WoW players have changed over the last decade and a half.
[3:56:22] Gordowins: and cancel culture
[3:56:23] Autoexeq: My man out here spittin facts
[3:56:24] spookychefkarolina: @91niki also this !
[3:56:26] Bernardo994: lookin out for the little guy
[3:56:27] LiveFromStua: True, I get less and less time for playing
[3:56:40] CrunkyBrewster: There was no Social in wrath. hardly.
[3:56:47] cothxd: its holly
[3:56:49] cothxd: she killed EQ
[3:56:50] cothxd: doing same now
[3:56:51] Zilberg: I miss talking in wow.. The Chuck norris jokes
[3:56:52] Nuerologicz: RDF wasnt too bad. To me the social experience stopped when they let you SEE and INTERACT with people from other servers
[3:56:54] Twips93: I can live without RDF at max lvl, fine with either. But for leveling I would very much had liked to have RDF.
[3:56:57] Nuerologicz: No server identity anymore
[3:56:59] AllenzoTV: wrath was the most social i have ever been in wow. I was fb friends with my guildies
[3:57:03] Neowanderer: exactly changed osmething that didnt need to be changed
[3:57:04] Squirrel_nutty: the anal dirge spam
[3:57:04] CrunkyBrewster: I think they're doing it because they know if LFD was on launch, ppl would skip over all of Northrend and just spam dungeons
[3:57:04] xsp00n: I think they just dont want to launch a half assed system when they will justr replace it with the better one we have in retail
[3:57:05] wowbigs: Because it's still a community to please... and care for. Regardless of what it once was, and what it will now be.
[3:57:16] Shanwerd: item lvl squish 4Head
[3:57:22] wienerbit: I'm very surprised that Blizzard didn't sell boosts
[3:57:27] 91Niki: @91Niki Have you looked at most social media sites lately? KEKW I am not saying everyone. But a lot of people are incapable of talking to others online. They won't say anything when you say "Hi". Unless they have something to complain about
[3:57:27] CrunkyBrewster: i mean really they can do that without LFD really. But LFD would be more convenient
[3:57:29] AnovaTwitch: Best city hub with Dalaran
[3:57:31] cinnamints: I think they just didn't have it for early patches in Wrath and didn't want to develop it, so they're going to add it at the end, like live did.
[3:57:33] Sollice: @91Niki I was surprised I didnt have to buy a new premium pass for BG but I guess I bought all year 1 content
[3:57:34] Zilberg: I lost my virginity to a girl from Wraith talking to people LUL
[3:57:44] loutre_malgache: They try it so they can decide if they do the same on retail later. I wouldn't be surprised if they do that on retail later if it works correctly on WotLK
[3:57:48] Biorrwolf: What's the point of playing an MMO then?
[3:57:49] Gordowins: the social part of wrath came with raising, raid finder ruined wow not dungeon finder
[3:57:50] 91Niki: @Sollice Yeah it's should include 3 or 4 seasons
[3:57:54] c0mmander_starscream: I just want to spam dungeons, ain't got no time to meet new friends
[3:57:58] Moobot: Bloodrave120, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:58:00] GamerGoat56: @zilberg EZ
[3:58:02] MILESkg21: hi :) xd
[3:58:02] Shrenko: o/
[3:58:05] kaimed_reformed: I play wow to help distract me when I get really anxious, so I mainly play solo
[3:58:08] Rudric_Ice: Facebook is closing down their Facebook gaming streams
[3:58:09] Zomgboy: hi :)
[3:58:10] Zilberg: o?
[3:58:11] Honvar: hi :)
[3:58:12] Theliahh: @loutre_malgache that would never happen KEKW
[3:58:12] teimos42: most wow streamers dont even use cam or voice, wow players are like the least social of all games LUL
[3:58:12] Badziee: HII <3
[3:58:13] HartGG: o/
[3:58:17] MoonwalkingAngel79: ppl also dont have time to wait for 2 hours to find group
[3:58:19] DeanoTV: FF is a cult OMEGALUL
[3:58:27] im_n0t_jezus: yup
[3:58:32] c0mmander_starscream: @Rudric_Ice lol thats why Goth came back to twitch
[3:58:36] bad_fish_too: To be fair it was added at the end of Wrath. So we didnt have it for almost the whole expansion.
[3:58:36] 770Cash: as it should be
[3:58:37] CrunkyBrewster: thats what i think too
[3:58:39] 91Niki: @Sollice I am waiting for Gattz to get home before playing, otherwise he's gonna yell at me LUL
[3:58:40] Zilberg: GamerGoat56 EZ
[3:58:42] MILESkg21: df fro uld would be insane
[3:58:44] Biorrwolf: Maybe I was just lucky to have a good guild that enjoyed talking to each other regularly
[3:58:45] CrunkyBrewster: they'll wait til at least ICC
[3:58:46] MILESkg21: for*
[3:59:03] SpoofAvatar: subs will drop off after the first month
[3:59:04] bullmastah: a map?
[3:59:04] jeneraljelly: @Biorrwolf same i made tons of social friends in classic /shrug
[3:59:12] Sollice: Well, I am not sure whats really new? New operator, map?
[3:59:12] QQisLIVE: Have you seen the LFG channels on a High pop TBC server? You can't even read anything because so much is spammed.
[3:59:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, it really happened
[3:59:22] CrunkyBrewster: Also Warhammer
[3:59:26] spookychefkarolina: Making friends it’s hard enough as it is without being forced to socialize in a game
[3:59:29] Sollice: Some new guns and vehicles?
[3:59:32] 91Niki: @Sollice New map, new specialist, and new battlepass to unlock stuff on
[3:59:41] bad_fish_too: @QQisLIVE Yeah pretty crazy on my server.
[3:59:41] Sollice: ok so thats what I have seen so far
[3:59:53] Zilberg: Whoever took out dungeon finder is kinda dumb
[4:00:00] CrunkyBrewster: yup no getting rejected etc
[4:00:02] cinnamints: True, plus it was a year between ICC and Cata, so ppl needed things to do
[4:00:02] Bearatello: now i get to copy and paste to groups!
[4:00:10] Nuerologicz: LFD will come back 100% just not on launch
[4:00:10] Shanwerd: they have a vision TM
[4:00:12] CrunkyBrewster: no Gearscore checks
[4:00:13] Biorrwolf: @jeneraljelly sad to hear that that's in the minority of experiences
[4:00:14] Nuerologicz: theres no way
[4:00:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: And tanks got a bag of goodies for being a tank and not DPS, it was good
[4:00:15] MILESkg21: df removed the social aspect of the game
[4:00:17] reggiepowa: @zilberg it was never in the game on launch anyway
[4:00:17] Fortvila: maybe to funnel the casual players more into retail
[4:00:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: remember when battlegrounds were server only and they figured out that mixing the servers made ques faster
[4:00:20] ScalarGaming: when did we have dungeon finder in original wrath
[4:00:22] wienerbit: That is the main reason I love LFD is that you can play the game enjoy what you want then poof do a dungeon
[4:00:25] Tharia: that was me.  late in lk, could hardly find anyone to group with, so then I became an altoholic as leveling to cap was my end game lol
[4:00:25] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: wrath have some of the best pvp along with Cata?
[4:00:25] nivrum: Classis Andy's that never liked any finder in WoW complained enough
[4:00:27] cothxd: holly is trash'
[4:00:30] im_n0t_jezus: kek
[4:00:35] nivrum: Classic*
[4:00:40] xsp00n: testing waters for wow2
[4:00:42] dec_u: people talkin bout social aspect of wow make ma laugh ngl
[4:00:46] yamammotto: @Towelliee because is MMORP that is why it is social. If you do not want social play diablo etc
[4:00:46] Biorrwolf: RDF is such a small thing though. Why are people to elevated about it?
[4:00:59] N3llee: preach it towel
[4:01:02] Aro725: Why did they take the ability to dissenchant an item away from the need/greed ??? like no one wants to put something in a trade window to get it d/ed
[4:01:02] Zilberg: reggiepowa Thats just an excuse not to have it
[4:01:03] Gordowins: their last vision was shadowlands js
[4:01:03] AudioJaq: No one who knows about how this game works wants LFD
[4:01:04] CrunkyBrewster: what feedback? LULW
[4:01:04] N3llee: 100%
[4:01:07] CrunkyBrewster: who ASKED??
[4:01:07] MILESkg21: KEKW
[4:01:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember LUL
[4:01:10] CrunkyBrewster: LULW
[4:01:15] dirtybluepanda: Hey Toweliee, that shelf system behind you was custom built wasn't it?
[4:01:16] xavrak: Was me
[4:01:18] MILESkg21: they got 1 GUY'D KEKW
[4:01:18] nivrum: probably asmon KEKW
[4:01:21] Timothious: Folks don't wanna sit around doing nothing for hours trying to put a group together
[4:01:22] bullmastah: they are mixing up LFD and LFR
[4:01:23] LTxMkilla: Asmongold lol
[4:01:32] yamammotto: @Towelliee if it was not social it would not keep me from vanilla till now
[4:01:33] Zilberg: Yeah just Asmon KEKW
[4:01:44] Funderik: feedback from cata, it was delayed feedback from 10 years ago
[4:01:47] Gordowins: lfd good lfr bad
[4:01:47] reggiepowa: @zilberg that and the fact that that tool has no place in classic
[4:01:47] Bloodrave120: You think they just don't have it ready? Lack of devs, more push to get it out the door?
[4:01:50] MILESkg21: same LuL
[4:01:53] Naturalbeef: No dungeon finder means I stay on Retail
[4:01:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Utgarde and Nexus will be hot
[4:01:58] Snabido: IKedit secretly making a trailer for the return of dungeon finder in future patch 😏
[4:02:01] Zilberg: reggiepowa Yeah sure LUL
[4:02:06] Dcarter: warlock you say
[4:02:06] MILESkg21: OCCULUS RUNS KEKW
[4:02:07] Biorrwolf: @k3ra_94 I just think it's very "Much Ado About Nothing" at this point
[4:02:10] Nimz83: More importantly, will this warlock have a corrupted ashbringer?
[4:02:14] Zilberg: Imma go warlock Towelliee Pog
[4:02:15] teimos42: dungeon findsr is just a scapegoat theyre using to differentiate why retail sucks and classic is good LUL
[4:02:22] board4life65: KEKW
[4:02:23] cinnamints: Nobody is going to be able to find the zone-in for Azjol-Nerub :D
[4:02:24] Gillettefuzionz: why would you need a warlock, use summon stones xD
[4:02:24] Nuerologicz: People dont want RDF because they think itll be like Retail RDF. No talking just slamming keys.
[4:02:33] TheGiant99: Asmon talks alot but won't even play.....He has Alpha and never plays but complains
[4:02:41] solsaver12: very true
[4:02:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Streamer privilege LUL

[4:03:04] Zilberg: Cough Asmon

[4:05:36] zeitgeiz: Classic was always a test of patience and time and never skill
[4:05:36] Pokasquantas: Does anyone know if we can claim 2 Dinar's this week ?
[4:05:38] reggiepowa: @k3ra_94 no, I don't that's it. give custom group finder a try, I assure you you won't waste too much of your time. wrath has very limited content anyway
[4:05:46] Bartilbeast: twitch ads are getting ridiculous

[4:05:55] Fluisterwoud: I know Vader got a nice deal. Hope he comes back to Twitch.
[4:05:56] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee South Park Called, they want Cartman back
[4:06:01] AkemiSuna: I wish towel would say : I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV Positive. with this voice
[4:06:10] manmower: they're trying to figure out how to get money from the younger crowd
[4:06:13] NatoThePotato91: Does anyone know what time pre patch is and will it be released same time for EU as US?
[4:06:17] xsp00n: its big in countries that just got into facebook in the last few years like south america and the middle east
[4:06:20] zeitgeiz: I basically only watch streams I’m subbed to and I move who I spend my prime on around.
[4:06:21] harpdarp: youtubes UI is trash
[4:06:22] c0mmander_starscream: Mixer
[4:06:23] Neuxx: How do i know which realms are the fresh ones when the pre patch comes out?
[4:06:23] Taaliaaaa: mixer
[4:06:24] Kakotan2143: mixr
[4:06:24] EclipserEU: Mixer
[4:06:25] Masqerader: Mixer
[4:06:25] Rexialiton: Mixer
[4:06:26] GothmaN: mixer
[4:06:27] Crutchie: mixer
[4:06:27] Zilberg: Mixer
[4:06:27] Metrii: It’s not weird it’s what our country has been doing rich people control everything, want everything for nothing.
[4:06:27] Yrdehn: mixer
[4:06:27] happybooger: Mixer
[4:06:27] Bernardo994: mixer
[4:06:32] Merkuriuz: @Fluisterwoud fuck vader... all he does is "CAN YOU TALK IN CHAT PLEASE!" , cause the chat on FB is so stupid delayed KEKW
[4:06:32] MILESkg21: MIXER / BEEM 4Head
[4:06:40] Platinumttw: @towelliee what time the servers will be up?
[4:06:46] Mathhbm: Mixer
[4:06:47] mavericks312: mixer threw to much money at 3 ppl
[4:06:48] oSirKnight: what about brime though? lol
[4:06:49] reggiepowa: @natothepotato91 supposed to start in 3-4 hours in na, tomorrow morning for europe
[4:06:50] manmower: they gotta give them a bigger cut
[4:06:50] Shanwerd: they paid way too much to few instead of giving a better cut to everyone
[4:06:51] SirBiggimus: Facebook blew all their money on DrLupo and Gothalion
[4:06:54] NetherRegion: sounds like a sound strategy
[4:06:55] Nuerologicz: You're just trying to play Single Player WoW in the end then with RDF. Which is fine play how you want. But that's not what an MMO is "traditionally" suppose to be
[4:07:04] Fluisterwoud: @Merkuriuz I totally forgot watching him soon as he went to FB. Golden times on Twitch though.
[4:07:04] NatoThePotato91: @reggiepowa  thank you very much
[4:07:07] MILESkg21: mixer bought 3 people and couldnt handle it
[4:07:16] MapleNiblets: just had like 5 mins of adds, but Even just seeing the name DoubleDoink makes my stomach drop....being a Bears fan sucks lol
[4:07:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Platinumttw Current estimate is about 4 hours on maintenance being done
[4:07:20] mavericks312: paying the top 2 streamers basically breaks your budget
[4:07:21] Nuerologicz: And they have a single player WoW. Called retail.
[4:07:22] Merkuriuz: @Fluisterwoud Very good times on twitch
[4:07:24] justrapid69: !wotlk
[4:07:25] Moobot: @justrapid69 I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[4:07:32] Neuxx: How do i know which realms are the fresh ones when the pre patch comes out?
[4:07:34] Shrenko: @Towelliee https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1564670006452944897 informative
[4:07:48] bad_fish_too: Eventually all the Facebook guys will come back
[4:07:50] Zilberg: Facebook gaming just sucks to watch
[4:07:51] Fortvila: @Nuerologicz the magic about MMO is that you could play it exactly how you wanted. Once they started to tell people how to play it, it went downwards
[4:07:54] Masqerader: Cheer100 Remember when Shroud said Mixer would be bigger than Twitch in 5 years LOL
[4:07:56] NetherRegion: You should start a streaming platform
[4:07:58] nivrum: they need big names first to get attention
[4:07:59] bad_fish_too: Goth already came back
[4:08:03] cyb0rg_007: mixxer seemed real for less than a year
[4:08:04] Tharia: a mix of levels would be best
[4:08:05] Metrii: Almost every other mmorpg has a type or group or dungeon finger. Idk why it’s such a big deal in wow. Everyone wants to have an opinion that matters.
[4:08:06] mavericks312: cause they want the name recognition
[4:08:12] MILESkg21: pepperidge farms remembers LuL
[4:08:13] abruptdecayO_O: yeah get 10-1 5 1-5k viewers and ur good and prob save some money
[4:08:16] Metrii: Or dungeon finder*
[4:08:17] zeitgeiz: If they nerfed the do by a lot in wrath so many more would play. All my friends moved to another server. Rather not spend more money on a transfer and leveling takes way too long
[4:08:17] c0mmander_starscream: lol
[4:08:19] Zilberg: KEKW
[4:08:21] spookychefkarolina: Because they can’t advertise with middle of the pack streamers
[4:08:23] ProClicker: LUL
[4:08:26] Shrenko: I liked Mixer layout
[4:08:27] board4life65: KEKW
[4:08:27] Shanwerd: it's hard tho, how many viewers would a 2k streamers have on another platform? you either give them a huge cut or it is a loss for everybody
[4:08:27] zeitgeiz: *xP
[4:08:28] Masqerader: lol
[4:08:34] Bernardo994: cak ack
[4:08:36] FireEmblemLord: ooff
[4:08:38] darkside72: Towelliee looking for that Youtube payday.
[4:08:39] RanciusAdventures: Basically listen to Twitch all day on my phone being in my pocket. YouTube requires premium to do that. No thanks
[4:08:45] cyb3rduck365: im telling him about yalls drama
[4:08:49] baldurchild: well i mean they gave most of their money to ninja lmao
[4:08:53] Masqerader: it aged like an open bag of chips
[4:08:57] Biorrwolf: Oh, it was just a joke. Streamers grief teasingly all the time
[4:09:01] 91Niki: Lets not be toxic
[4:09:02] spookychefkarolina: People see a ninja commercial and they (generally) know who he is. It’s not the same marketing power with middle of the pack streamers.
[4:09:02] oSirKnight: who remembers the Brime hype? lol
[4:09:06] Nuerologicz: WoW was fine before LFD was introduced in retail. which btw was at the LITERAL END of Wotlk. You guys fight for it like its been in the game since 2004.
[4:09:19] Ariea_Whisper: They’d also be getting payed by the company taking them so dropping viewers wouldn’t be a issue
[4:09:19] Zilberg: I will go to a new platform if their video watching and chat is better to use
[4:09:20] MaceBTW: getting middle of hte pack streamers at first and THEN taking the top streamers it would seem like the big streamers saw what was happening and followed
[4:09:27] mavericks312: if youtube was to sign say OTK then you would see a change

[4:11:01] spookychefkarolina: @haxzorjimduggan LUL LUL
[4:11:01] Nuerologicz: It makes a social game social. Yea you have to look for a group longer than doing the content but thats not WoWs fault thats the players fault for wanting to tryhard every single piece of content that comes out
[4:11:03] oSirKnight: switching hasnt had the same impact as it used too. A lot of the streamers that switch can maintain the same numbers pretty regularly
[4:11:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Bellular does like a podcast thing

[4:14:41] MoonwalkingAngel79: il never follow to other platform im twitcher for life
[4:14:53] Nuerologicz: @k3ra_94 what does that have to do with RDF? Like i said whether its in or not doesnt matter to me. Gaming isnt the same as it was in 2008 its literally nothing but "meta or youre bad" and LFD would just be another meta
[4:15:37] xxxcHEF: @Nuerologicz more like meta or pure GDKP buyer
[4:15:40] snuffles_80: naahh ...

[4:16:17] BACK_INTO_THE_POOL: that's quite fascinating actually (regarding the fact that there are so fucking many 1k plus streamers), I can't keep up anymore even though I registered 2012, maybe I'm just getting older
[4:16:18] Tyrammus84: @Towelliee Hey thats like Kinggothalion said the other day he glady took 2.5 million to go to mixer
[4:16:21] Masqerader: baseball player money? 10 million is bench player money for the NBA
[4:16:25] mdblaze4: all about money

[4:17:10] Nuerologicz: In the end you just want Single Player WoW. Which is called "Shadowlands" right now
[4:17:14] Gordowins: twitch signed the doc to a rediculous deal to stop him from going to mixer, then mixer collapses and doc gets ban so twitch don't have to pay

[4:17:25] spookychefkarolina: @abracka_ towLove towLove towLove towLove
[4:17:34] 91Niki: My issue with youtube is. Their platform isn't as optimized as twitch. Lack of proper UI for both seeing that the streamer is live, and chat. That's a huge turn off for me. Which is why I never watch youtube live
[4:17:39] BACK_INTO_THE_POOL: @MilesKG21 and it's not even thaaaat bad :]
[4:17:40] Sollice: EHHHH we have had 30k+ in this channel and we have maintained it fine
[4:17:55] Biorrwolf: Are you going Horde?
[4:17:58] stubb11: !fresh
[4:17:58] Moobot: @stubb11 Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:17:59] Sollice: Its more how you want your community to be
[4:17:59] Nuerologicz: If you wanted LFD so bad and want it to follow true classic you shouldnt get LFD until ICC anyways like it was in retail so why does it matter its not in at launch?
[4:18:05] MILESkg21: 30k is pretty tame in here :)
[4:18:06] LemonDrizzleCakes: i meant are you going to fresh servers or existing ones
[4:18:13] GQadams: why a fresh server?
[4:18:16] Zivs: @Sollice 30k in this channel vs 30k in ninja channel is quite the difference YEP
[4:18:23] Broomba: @towelliee -- will the wrath classic ptr today have the WotLK content to level to 70 or not until Sept 26 when wotlk content goes live
[4:18:23] teglalala: do you think the fresh servers will last?
[4:18:32] Masqerader: that's retirement money in 1 contract
[4:18:33] garmin1987: things i would do for that kinda money

[4:18:39] love_eggplant: would you do gamba streams for 1mil a month
[4:18:42] 91Niki: @Zivs That's just called lack of proper moderation ;)
[4:18:44] LTxMkilla: Then he went to Facebook gaming lol
[4:18:46] paragon_3: that's enough money to never have to work again
[4:18:48] MILESkg21: what would you do for a KLONDIKE BAR Kappa
[4:18:54] Sollice: Yeah thats because I wont let chat degenerate if we had 5 people in here lol
[4:19:01] Sollice: Not just me I mean any mod

[4:19:28] Nuerologicz: And youll play it again without it on launch 12 years later lol
[4:19:30] Zivs: @Broomba it's not PTR it's prepatch, and lv 70 is available since that's TBC levels, when wrath goes live in a month, lv 80 comes available
[4:19:36] spookychefkarolina: What do you mean Towel, don’t you pop bottles in the club every day?

[4:20:01] 91Niki: Just go look at Cohhs chat. He often rock +10-20k viewers. His chat is super readable and calm. It's called having good moderators and upholding the rules of the channel, whether you have 5 viewers or 50k
[4:20:02] AvrithSATX: You're not fooling us. We know you're in deep with your trading card pusher. ;P

[4:21:39] 91Niki: @HedgyV Right, but we have emote spam in here too. Every channel does. But it's beyond that where you moderate. You can allow fun while still keeping chat sane

[4:30:40] Crutchie: 70 boost isnt going to be free
[4:30:48] Twill923: i mean 68
[4:30:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: The boost is not free, that package is $49.99
[4:30:56] iisobase: Is flying cheaper in wrath?

[4:31:23] Kinghorn: yes regular is much cheaper, epic is still 5k
[4:31:25] dreamwalker213: @greyardbtw yes
[4:31:26] Funderik: do you really expect them to not do a alpha patch/release beta?
[4:31:30] XshadowturkeyX: yes the bease flying is cheaper the 280% speed isnt cheaper
[4:31:32] Twill923: @Zizida yea i dont kno just guessing
[4:31:34] tronbadgames: nalak will spawn 14 more times before classic servers come up
[4:31:46] mrrazputin: @johnnyxgamerr 996 attemps is not much for pandarian bosses
[4:31:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can't remember what the level requirement for Sons of Hodir is
[4:31:50] Loranis: i think u need flying to even get there
[4:31:54] Aro725: they never dropped for me on p server until i did the questline
[4:31:55] Sunyankzi: They're there but you had to quest to unlock the vendor or something.
[4:31:57] Kinghorn: they are there but loooting them does not give you anything until a certain point in the quest Towelliee
[4:31:58] GQadams: why you gonna be playing on a fresh server?
[4:31:59] iisobase: How much cheaper are we talking lol
[4:32:00] CrookedCrookK: just kill the big guys and u get them i think
[4:32:11] SpenceSir: If i wanna play WOTLK what version do i download?
[4:32:29] Crutchie: @greyardbtw epic still costs 5k i think but base goes from 60 to 150
[4:32:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: "To start on the quest chain to earn your way in the Sons favor you need to be at least level 77 and have cold weather flying."
[4:32:36] luckfore: youre beta
[4:32:45] XshadowturkeyX: base flying is like 700g cheaper and if you have exalted rep 280% flying is 4250
[4:32:50] iisobase: @crutchie ah ok ty
[4:32:51] Blah206: Your first dk is free (excluding fresh)
[4:33:05] Zivs: Oh yeah we need to see what other wod/legion dungeons Season 1 will include
[4:33:12] colorain0: Hord or Alliance @Towelliee ?
[4:33:23] dreamwalker213: @greyardbtw regular flying goes from like 900ish total to like 400ish and also goes from 60% to 150%
[4:33:26] midgar86: isn't wotlk fresh server NA already online ?
[4:33:27] siixmodes: horde

[4:33:35] Twill923: got it
[4:33:41] bad_fish_too: It works on TBC why wouldnt it?
[4:33:53] dreamwalker213: @midgar86 no, not up for another 3 hours
[4:34:05] Zivs: @queban_305 addons always break when u update to a new game version
[4:34:12] Zivs: not always but alot of the time
[4:34:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: The mages can't AoE farm in instances like they used to, with the changes
[4:34:26] midgar86: @dreamwalker213 i'm curious about the EU launch, when its gonna happen
[4:34:30] bad_fish_too: @Zivs True
[4:34:44] booevil: tukui has elvui wolk beta version
[4:34:49] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @vvs_dre (warning)

[4:34:56] ProClicker: Can't you test the ELVUI in PTR?
[4:35:02] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee you can' enter storm peaks without flying
[4:35:08] saevenar: at the end of wrath it was 68 to fly in northrend
[4:35:10] SpcBleau: there was a boa you could buy thats why 77 was important
[4:35:14] mavericks312: will LK still have limited attempts
[4:35:23] Kale_Nd: can't*
[4:35:27] Hellexis: pally are still doing

[4:35:39] jaalexba: damn I forgot about limited attempts
[4:35:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the prot paladins will get stunned if they try the instance farming
[4:35:45] goatdougdimmadome: The first character you level to 80 will be having to wait until 77 for cold weather flying, but after you get the first 80 you can buy the BoA tome for all other characters
[4:35:48] jaalexba: they need that for world first :)
[4:35:51] ryanc1124: need early servers plox
[4:36:01] snuffles_80: wasnt it mostly boosting that got hit with nerfs?

[4:36:38] mavericks312: yall dont remember wrath raiding was a joke

[4:36:50] demenes_1: the boa tomes for flying I believe did not come until panda or warlords I believe
[4:36:51] Templexx: lol every classic launch. its soooo hard
[4:36:54] Rilix: it was 50 attempts across all heroic bosses in the dungeons, so if you wipe on heroic sindragosa you have 49 left when you get to heroic lich king
[4:36:55] Lotrian: !wotlk
[4:36:56] Bsirk: Priest blog on wowhead

[4:37:37] Twill923: but ulduar is a gorgeous raid
[4:37:39] DiscordOG: Wasn't it Putri, BQ, Sindra and LK that deducted the attempts only?
[4:37:41] CousinAvi86: pretty sure it was only for Lich King
[4:37:50] Mortianto: Mortianto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 103 months! 
[4:37:59] Aro725: Its going to be wayyyy harder 13 ilvl lower too in ICC with no buff
[4:38:00] demenes_1: @haxzorjimduggan is that one of the changes they were talking about coming to this wrath?

[4:38:26] looney199725: what are u most excited about for DF other than raiding
[4:38:47] bad_fish_too: Im happy for 10 mans

[4:39:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah you can do one 10 and one 25, either normal or heroic
[4:39:51] Aro725: I wish they would leave it alone. I dont play classic to sweat. Thats what retail is for me. I get my CE and then play classic to have fun and relax
[4:39:52] Crutchie: yea they fixed maladath
[4:39:53] Twill923: i wonder if they will do cata classic lmao

[4:39:55] Crutchie: it shows pve now
[4:40:10] eatonaround: 10 and 25 have separate lock outs. Within 10 and 25 normal and heroic share lock outs
[4:40:11] Neowanderer: did they keep all the badges for loot?
[4:40:25] abruptdecayO_O: west coast best coast
[4:40:33] Zeuzo: @Towelliee  its launch the same time for Eu also?

[4:40:39] veryboredguy1: skyfury should of been east coast :(
[4:40:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 10 mans drop the same badges as 25, they said, which is great
[4:40:58] DiscordOG: Not 25 normal
[4:41:03] N3llee: dont think you can do 25 man normal
[4:41:07] Zeuzo: yes
[4:41:10] Zeuzo: true
[4:41:11] yuvalal: There is new priest post by Wow for alpha

[4:41:18] N3llee: thought it was 1 ten man and 1 25 man
[4:41:19] N3llee: period
[4:41:23] gentlemangrand: well trial is first hc raid
[4:41:26] Skidakid223: THAT
[4:41:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: you can do 10 normal or heroic AND 25 normal or heroic
[4:41:28] isHuddy: is leveling faster in wrath or about the same
[4:41:29] Gordowins: patiently waiting for California to break off and full into the ocean
[4:41:30] Zeuzo: u can do 25 normal also
[4:41:33] Heazy7: yo @towelliee any thoughts on the prot pally tree in Dragonflight? saw some vids that kinda worry me
[4:41:38] Mecabeast: should be 10 man and 25 man's are different lockouts
[4:41:43] Skidakid223: its one herioc one normal
[4:41:44] MILESkg21: Gordowins Florida should be first Kappa
[4:41:46] Skidakid223: any
[4:41:47] eatonaround: you have (1) 10 man lock out and (1) 25 man lock out. That's it
[4:41:47] Twill923: i think if you do a heroic your locked to it all
[4:41:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: If you do a 25 heroic, then you can only do a 10 man heroic, I'm pretty sure
[4:41:53] MangoChanTV: "We’ve decided that lockouts should be shared between Heroic and Normal versions of the raid, but NOT between 10/25-player versions of the raid. You’ll be able to do both the 10-player and 25-player version of each raid every lockout period but will have to choose between Normal and Heroic for the raids that offer that choice."
[4:41:53] Twill923: i dunno tho
[4:41:58] Crutchie: blue post says 10/25 man is shared on heroic BUT NOT on normal
[4:42:04] Mecabeast: so 10 man normal can't run 10 man heroic but could do 25man heroic
[4:42:18] yuvalal: i can link if you want .
[4:42:18] manmower: paladins have a lot of abilities already i think

[4:43:15] AllenzoTV: i didnt even think about faction balance back in the day
[4:43:20] Twill923: im def gonna duel wield them 2h lolol
[4:43:22] Gordowins: in wrath you can switch to heroic and back mid raid, that's why you get one 10 man and one 25
[4:43:27] XshadowturkeyX: ally was more i think but pretty even, alot of people saying human racials are the best in wrath tho
[4:43:28] Neowanderer: bring back pally di

[5:34:56] mavericks312: neville is the goat
[5:34:57] Sollice: @Gordowins  None of this is true but ok
[5:34:59] bigoldmeatpie: neville was the carry
[5:35:07] abracka_: i loved that he ends up with luna
[5:35:10] th3janitor: the chinese scottish lass is from my home town :D
[5:35:12] spookychefkarolina: @sollice yeah! The worst. It’s like I’m being roasted alive man
[5:35:28] Roaringkittylol: Luna is a freak I bet
[5:35:28] Gordowins: is true splice trying educate yourself

[6:08:03] Roaraxx: yeah man i want dungeon finder
[6:08:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: their ass
[6:08:13] Vile_: @TheMrSodapop It's Twitch chat, dude. People talk out of their ass all the time.
[6:08:17] Gordowins: the pre patch at end of maintenance scheduled for 3pdt
[6:08:44] Kaellen: A decent compromise would be Dungeon Finder for normals at least
[6:08:47] Gordowins: I said 37 minutes and I made it up
[6:08:47] BobSalamis: Heya, @towelliee ! any info on when the classic realms go back live?
[6:09:07] Vile_: @BobSalamis It says on the launcher that it's supposed be 3PM pacific, bud. Reading is fundamental.

[6:10:14] board4life65: nah they are going to reintroduce in ICC

[6:12:46] Gordowins: LFR ruined wow not LFD
[6:12:59] XshadowturkeyX: we see LFR gine b4 LFD and thats deff never gonna happen
[6:13:05] cothxd: LFR didnt ruin wow lol. Besides forcing us in cata to grind for gear
[6:13:16] Aidler: LFR is the only way for me to experience raids
[6:13:18] Vile_: lmao @ people saying "LFR ruined wow"
[6:13:47] Ancalegorn: i love LFR..
[6:13:49] solor3544: nothing wrong with lfr
[6:13:53] Syprus1: @Torrentialx if she was behind no lfd in wrath id say she is outta touch.. ala eq popularity vs wow
[6:13:53] m4gnify: @gordowins nah, i think it just opened up raiding for people who weren't going to do normals anyway
[6:14:16] happybooger: @Towelliee i agree, and when they try to do that it seems like they dont play their own game
[6:14:16] NILLme: blizz need to make some kind of Classic+ version with new zones and dungs/raids
[6:14:19] Vile_: LFR has ZERO bearing on anything else. It's just... there, yeah.
[6:14:23] jkitchin75: lfr is ok if you dont have time to raid
[6:14:27] cinnamints: I've always thought the "community" explanation was a cover for not wanting to spend the time/money adapting LFD that didn't exist until the end of Wrath to the earlier patches.
[6:14:28] nightmayor12: in LFR the Affix is the other players on your team, that is it
[6:14:38] cothxd: Didnt statistics show most of the playerbase does lfr?
[6:14:40] 91Niki: Being social is scary sacSUFFER
[6:14:43] PhillyDilly18: I love LFR because it allows me to experience the content. I just don’t have the time to raid even normal mode
[6:14:45] kalliran: They need to fix the damn community. Just returned to the game and get flamed in trade for asking a question that I was told to google. To hell with me if I decide to ask the community or be social.
[6:14:49] Crafty_plays: The only people that hate LFR are elitists that have nothing better to do than to complain that someone at a lower level of game knowledge or skill can still experience the same content
[6:14:49] saevenar: at this point normal raid could be queued
[6:14:56] Dkgungo: Dkgungo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 120 months! 
[6:15:02] Gordowins: LFR did ruin wow, getting into raids was the real social part of the game, if you wanted to experience end game you had to keep a decent rep on your realm and interact with people
[6:15:04] raynestormfur: i love green colored gearsets and most often LFR gets the green sets :P
[6:15:14] valth: hell im doing lfr right now!
[6:15:22] Vile_: @Gordowins  This has got to be the most refrigerator-temp take I've read all day.
[6:15:29] Vile_: Fridge temp IQ*
[6:15:35] Syprus1: @Dkgungo was that 120 months? thats like 20 years
[6:15:44] Vile_: LFR isn't endgame.
[6:15:49] jkitchin75: @Gordowins  are you high
[6:15:54] Vile_: It's a raid, but it's defo not endgame.

[6:17:01] jarilrpg: you can NOT queue for raids in ESO, which makes me sad
[6:17:01] strike879: problem is if you want to do normal raidlead asks for cutting edge
[6:17:09] SinicalDev: they have to add incentives for experienced players to help people complete easier difficulties
[6:17:13] Gordowins: I don't know what LFR has done to retail cause I quit in it's first expansion
[6:17:14] Theliahh: @calvine33 it's an MMO lol no way
[6:17:20] TheRealAxiom: But like half the raid is afk/ brain dead
[6:17:20] UltraKSlaya: more cosmic flux!
[6:17:31] Nicstar1007: They should make LFR for only 1 Person
[6:17:32] rodimusprime085: if you cant keep a raid schedule, LFR
[6:17:37] UltraKSlaya: and rep
[6:17:39] AllenzoTV: I remember my realm had 25m pugs every tuesday pretty much
[6:17:41] Syprus1: @kalliran do raids and pvp and mythic+ you will get in vaults also any mythic+ gear can be upgraded to tier using cos,ic flux
[6:17:58] LegoCoin: Did they release the fresh server names ?
[6:18:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: i will never do sylvanas lfr again
[6:18:23] ozzythegreat: ozzythegreat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! :)
[6:18:26] calvine33: @calvine33 Theres plenty of people who just play this to get mounts or do whatever with people they know irl. why do you need to gatekeep? LFR doesnt hurt you in anyways
[6:18:31] TheRiwen: @HaxzorJimDuggan Yea that fight is so bad

[6:18:57] tomkushaman: Sylvanas LFR was hell. Waiting almost 1 hr for people
[6:19:03] Dkgungo: lots of people would quit if they removed LFR it allows alot of people who dont want to be a hardcore raider see the content
[6:19:04] rodimusprime085: LFR benefits: gear option to boost ilvl for reg raids, no waiting for replacement, no schedule, no running to raid door, accessable to story chasers
[6:19:08] LegoCoin: @stigzqt  yes on non-fresh severs
[6:19:13] Vile_: Cosmic Fucks NODDERS
[6:19:24] stigzqt: @LegoCoin ty!

[6:19:27] ravimatrixx: how are you today towelliee?
[6:19:45] HairyNackers: @tomkushaman some queues were insane, but allowed freedom to do other things while you wait. rather than spamming chat for ages.
[6:19:47] calvine33: Guarantee the people who are saying LFR ruins mythic raiding are likely only normal level raiders
[6:19:47] blorgii: definitely makes sense that most que it though
[6:19:49] Syprus1: @kalliran yea it will change it to tier and with any socket or speed avoidance stat it might have had

[7:33:47] britishwideboi: how come yours is wotlk themed? mine is still showing tbc background?
[7:33:48] ArcaneSyntax: like mining gave extra stam

[7:37:31] tuckz: @Subjektive omg! good investigation!
[7:37:33] Sir_KnightErrant: @SilveredKnightErrant in that case id take no node sharing to get rid of some of the farming bots. They make the economy side of the game not as much fun
[7:37:40] SonofHorus82: @fourteenfour it takes longer for us older folk.
[7:37:42] Sir_KnightErrant: also the multi boxers would get bent
