[0:32:59] LiveKayd: what about the guild clear last night that got Druid hammer and Purple Staff
[0:32:59] Scubasage: For hunters, it's all buffs except for the beast mastery rune
[0:32:59] crazyboy1_: those are buffs. they nerfed pet damage only
[0:32:59] Saturos47: @Xaryu all the buffs are just on the glove rune slot which you use the now nerfed bm rune anyway.
[0:32:59] LilTaisu: thanks blizzard I will stop playing my hunter and just play warrior lime you want
[0:32:59] YzieGG: last line
[0:33:00] fakeGrimes: not live yet

[0:33:04] zavior88: time to go marksman
[0:33:04] Basilikos12: they're hunter "buffs"
[0:33:06] SeanH4: hunter buffs don’t matter. nerfs outweigh badly
[0:33:09] davedobbs: priest healing has dropped significantly can confirm im 15/16 bis
[0:33:10] arkddwn: Why would they do it 1/2 way through the day
[0:33:11] its_hoyt: pet nerf

[0:33:11] epicninja808: only beast mastery nerf

[0:33:14] xNotorietyx: no big pet nerf, 25% priest nerf
[0:33:14] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu BM-runes nerfed
[0:33:15] thebigdogg3: yeah cus no one plays MM
[0:33:15] FezzikGG: you still go BM and so it is just a nerf overall
[0:33:16] SlabbyDaby: BM nerfed a little bit, MM Buffed
[0:33:16] bronchoped1: Chimera buffed means nothing. All same slot
[0:33:16] sniped1414: it's all buffs with pet nerfs basically
[0:33:16] s4mkush: "Buffs"
[0:33:17] HippieHopping: cause the pets are way to redic

[0:33:25] Varjant: beast mastery nerfed so it wouldnt be a clear choice
[0:33:25] miciahclay: big pet nerf
[0:33:26] handpickedbytim: hunters mad that the computer wont play the game for them KEKL
[0:33:27] battlenetq: i think chat is trolling
[0:33:27] Svaenor: rip my Priest x.x
[0:33:27] tsetse2fly: correct
[0:33:29] miciahclay: that focus is tough
[0:33:29] ThePlayerCoachStun: lmao..
[0:33:30] bananahammuck: its a nerf
[0:33:35] Rekoldt: They’re stealing a piece of your glory tonight
[0:33:36] s4mkush: 100% a nerf though
[0:33:37] Skriptmonkey: Priest is straight up nerf tho.
[0:33:37] Muckbot1: ITS PERFECT CHANGE <3
[0:33:37] yo_beats: Slight buff to MM
[0:33:38] Puppette: massive nerf lol
[0:33:39] Mpx_24: ye but u dont use them xD
[0:33:39] ThatDudeSmallz: Huge nerf to hunter dos
[0:33:39] Xaledin_Eroom: BM rune was the only op One
[0:33:40] ThePlayerCoachStun: its a nerf..no one uses that other shit its still not better.
[0:33:41] s4mkush: just in a way of a "buff"
[0:33:42] Saturos47: @Xaryu doesnt buff the hunter. you dont use those runes
[0:33:42] beepo_gaming: The priest healing nerf is huge af
[0:33:43] MistahClaun: pets are doing half of hunter damage what is pretty silly
[0:33:45] papavicks: It's a massive nerf. They buffed abilities that aren't used and will not be used still. @Xaryu
[0:33:48] tomfxs: Chimera was at 125% dmg and was still meh
[0:33:48] roxzssx: SoD is such a joke KEKW
[0:33:49] YzieGG: mage solo dungeon but nerv pets, cause player cant CC KEKW
[0:33:49] bananahammuck: the damage you gain from the mana and the 15% is not enough to offset how much damage they nerffed the BM rune
[0:33:51] wookinit: its nothing to worry about at all
[0:33:51] Aitor229: BIG F for priest
[0:33:52] SghettiBoy: BRo maybe my HPal will be top finally
[0:33:53] castle_wow: Are they serious
[0:33:54] Arandur87: Chimera and Explosive does 0 dmg, the "buffs" are crap^^
[0:33:55] chewzlurv: hardcore hype lol
[0:33:56] ThatDudeSmallz: Pets were OP but yeah thats a huge nerf
[0:33:57] bronchoped1: @xaryu it's all same rune slot though. So hunter is a straight nerf
[0:33:59] Chef_Nick: @Xaryu its finee he should run homies anyway
[0:34:01] Muckbot1: @papavicks You cant call yourself a true hunter
[0:34:01] Goated_Goods: Not sure if they are live yet. The tooltip on the Chimshot rune still says 85%
[0:34:02] davedobbs: priests are still strong healers with flash heal but penance / pom is big
[0:34:04] ThePlayerCoachStun: they didnt buff the other abilities enough for them to matter. so technically all in all its a big nerf
[0:34:04] jwubb: @Xaryu didnt nerf his Dispels KEKW
[0:34:07] Reimtime41: You want the dispell anyway
[0:34:08] ZefyrSSF: druids might be strongest healer now
[0:34:08] Vichrinox: its as if the universe is telling you all youre going to die in BFD
[0:34:09] garbagekidttv: theyre basically making hunters back into vanilla hunter
[0:34:10] AstralDoge: Copium
[0:34:11] jacksunson: Check the buffs and prep that the SoDcore raid had last night
[0:34:11] LilTaisu: Blizzard tuning due to "outperforming" is absolutely ridiculous with lvl 25 content
[0:34:11] kusheck: for normal runs, the priest 20% is just going to mean less overhealing
[0:34:12] Josephxdxp: When is the BFD RUN? (im on EU time) @Xaryu
[0:34:13] iStrudderz: @Arandur87 until ur farming rfk with explosive on 5 mobs per pull
[0:34:14] Cross86: they're pretty vital to keep tank alive LUL
[0:34:15] s4mkush: POM is insane at the moment
[0:34:16] infuze27: priest use homonculi instead of Pom anyway
[0:34:16] realquaked: That's actually a painful nerf
[0:34:17] Jadedarms: Makes sense, I think overall maybe too much of a nerf, might need more hunter buffs to their core abilities, GL tonight in the raid
[0:34:18] wookinit: goated
[0:34:19] thebigdongerhere: 100% wipe
[0:34:19] Nofeerr: They nerf the only viable healer, instead of buffing the others
[0:34:20] JoshXy1: 2

[1:04:47] Niodada: People play fearless, because lvl 25 is easy
[1:04:48] xiClutchBoyix: The damage in the world being turned up is definitely a factor.
[1:04:48] willy_away: people just buy gold in HC so yeah its harder Lol
[1:04:49] aujewinashoe: well ofc, trading/grouping/boosting nullifies the whole hardcore challenge
[1:04:49] leelagsd: everyone thinks they can get to 25 fast so risk more
[1:04:49] Naphelion: you'd never have a warrior try take on 3 mobs in real hc tho
[1:04:50] s4mkush: if u want Fap you must level alch then if u want goggle u must level engi Sodcore is 5x harder than hardcore
[1:05:01] yozys: People are not as careful since its only to lvl back to 25
[1:05:02] wookinit: but isnt there a bug the worst your gear is the more dmg you do? staysafe showed this on his stream

[1:27:52] ketchgg: @Xaryu pretty sure 5/5 wrath ends up clipping a bit due to GCD being slower than spell cooldown. so that looks pretty good to me

[2:00:03] keredj: true
[2:00:03] loris18794: @Xaryu maybe it is harded but you are only 25 there is not much on the line.. so normal hardcore and you are lvl 50+ is way more intense because you have more to loose
[2:00:05] Smart_Shark: @kolarovmcfc he flagged for pvp in barrens and died to horde
[2:00:09] Akompliss: Pretty true

[2:00:47] wookinit: @Smart_Shark how does he die to his own faction?
[2:00:49] UnsafeCell: normal HC is easy, since xarbar can hit 60 xD
[2:00:53] Mahca_: @blurri88 imo it makes it hc, just not ssf hc

[3:04:51] beepo_gaming: So chat can they only run BFD one time because its SoDcore?

[3:06:41] hendu7655: @xaryu imo the only dumb part of this is u should allow potion buying on AH. Considering you could 5/7 bfd many times to gear up and thats allowed. So may as well allow buying pots. Also your competing against non HCs to farm pots
[3:06:43] JeebieTheSwampSage: "The Balance tree has been removed from druids"

[3:07:32] iRayG2: I seen a bunch in 1k needles
[3:07:35] Wyvernlight: is ozzy gonna make it?

[3:29:43] Cody0120: arcane is actually pdecent without gear
[3:29:44] Mr_Quack_Quack: Spell hit cap is 6% since bosses are only lvl 28, so u get hit cap with talents

[3:30:46] asystrolle: @BeeMcG not as bad as hunters

[3:33:14] Chef_Nick: Press 1 if you are too cheap to buy the ashenvale mount
[3:33:14] wouldyousnack: Pog
[3:33:21] bambirexkekw: big shoulder
[3:33:22] TurtleBearAU: What was the decision behind going back to Boomy for raid? Just fun factor?

[4:11:51] espi: PepeLaugh espi pee
[4:11:52] evrgamerr: I guess ozzy didn't "fall' this time :)
[4:11:54] RealDadEnergy: I watched ozy die and then you dueled me on that zep in org. felt like someone handed me a controller for mortal kombat and didn’t tell me the moves lmao
[4:11:57] Dakuten: WaitWhat super small pp

[4:12:14] marius402: Didnt you say yesterday that people who ding right before the raid are kinda griefing :D ?
[4:12:15] ebe____: you missed dash from Jasons pot mark
[4:12:15] BootsTheAlpaca: Mitch died 3 times??

[4:13:04] hendu7655: @xaryu imo the only dumb part of this is u should allow potion buying on AH. Considering you could 5/7 bfd many times to gear up and thats allowed. So may as well allow buying pots. Also your competing against non HCs to farm pots but cant use AH
[4:13:06] MattheusD: unfortunately your dps will probably be low in P2 so FAP will run out

[4:19:09] evrgamerr: True its a chain - as a mage you understand the importance of DPS - why I hated playing a healer, its always your fault no matter the speed of the raid vs mana pool - sometimes it takes an act of god to get players to understand your oom'd
[4:19:09] NotALoginName: @Boetjeuh free action potion
[4:19:09] xOutcoldx: ranged can split and its not as bad , but melee it wil chain all 3 everytime

[4:25:55] MiseSC2: @angelc843 if you could farm dungeons, p2 would be super easy
[4:25:57] garbagekidttv: soy is REALLLY BAD FOR YOU
[4:25:59] garbagekidttv: lol
[4:26:03] aadeBirger: Why would soy not be good for you, i mean yeah it usually contains alot of sodium but its natural
[4:26:03] dreadnoughht56: @Atreyu_Gaming we love mitch around here
[4:26:03] GUGGERINHO: do u like sushi?
[4:26:14] xiClutchBoyix: The truth is that Mitch got one guyed in chat, dude mentioned some dark stuff and Mitch took it real hard.  Ended stream and apparently had to go make a song about it.

[4:26:27] bcainkong: @xiClutchBoyix wait, what haha
[4:26:29] Maiqthehighking: xarCOPIUM
[4:26:31] attilabrah: BFD in 30 min?
[4:26:37] Timeswipe: @Thugatron You act like it is super high in sodium or something Kappa
[4:26:49] xiClutchBoyix: @thugatron  pretty much.  You can check vod, not sure if it's up or not
[4:26:51] thehorrorblygreatshow: Its an added challenge....that's why. It's simple.
[4:26:52] shloom995: the easier people get to 25 the easier it dies dont you agree @Xaryu
[4:26:53] Tamftw_: are you still going to fish?
[4:26:53] Kaistah: @atreyu_gaming he’s chillin and you’re hatin
[4:27:03] Weedor: Its still hella ezmode
[4:27:04] deepfriedbrainforlunch: good rule
[4:27:05] xwowkillax: such a great view for raid EZ https://www.multitwitch.tv/guzu/xaryu/ozyfallz/savix
[4:27:09] MarkyOchoa: Why not just say at 25 that rule no longer applies
[4:27:09] colt420x: Arent runes already op?
[4:27:14] Weedor: runes make it piss ez
[4:27:14] D_I_X_0_N: Ruins p2 aswell
[4:27:18] calamirlol: Can you do dungeons over again at lvl 25 though?
[4:27:22] bcainkong: @xiClutchBoyix saying words to say words is fun eh?
[4:27:23] Karnalsyn: @Xaryu  What about a challenge where you can only use Rank 1 abilities?
[4:27:23] MiseSC2: @MarkyOchoa because that ruins   p2
[4:27:24] AMLoogi: i liked the one dungeon per character it made the dungeons more eventful
[4:27:26] attilabrah: mitch not comming?
[4:27:27] pxrkerp: Does this apply to BFD?
[4:27:29] ImBory: @MarkyOchoa because next phase leveling will be easy
[4:27:30] Donho2: then you die
[4:27:31] iLtDan: agree
[4:27:35] Glunt91: you got starsurge level 3
[4:27:37] iLtDan: 1 dungeon is awesome
[4:27:37] MiseSC2: @pxrkerp yes
[4:27:40] iNicholas: but depression hits when you get nothing
[4:27:44] toastfairy: So raid in like 40 min?
[4:27:44] jstuwie: Thats the HC ADVENTURE!
[4:27:44] Weedor: classic hc is actually hard, this is a joke
[4:27:49] beepo_gaming: So wait @Xaryu BFD is technically a raid now. So why only once. Thought that applied to dungeons only?
[4:27:49] xiClutchBoyix: @thugatron I know it's hard to believe, but I'm literally not trolling.
[4:27:50] Datbawx: At that point just say no one can use non-grey gear
[4:27:52] zerozuckerl: @xwowkillax the fuck I didnt know that existed, amazing
[4:27:53] 1shabbymn: quest items generally get replaced by dungeon items so why would you not allow quest items and allow dungeon spam? It only makes sense to not allow spamming dungeons
[4:27:54] kumah_1: makes sense I guess
[4:27:56] Irishexit: by that logic why allow anything other than grey gear?
[4:27:56] Donho2: i like it
[4:28:01] NinoLaRue: hey @xaryu we’re you getting nervous as you were getting ready to buy the 💍 for Shannon? I’m going to buy a ring in a few weeks (finish saving) and I’m hella nervous! 🤣
[4:28:05] Nomad124: put stuff in bank?
[4:28:06] marcusllee: 2 or 3 man reduces dopamine by ensuring you get drop though
[4:28:14] bagenjoyer: the 1 dungeon thing made sense before no quest loot
[4:28:14] GUGGERINHO: do u like sushi? 󠀀
[4:28:17] Nomad124: kekw
[4:28:18] Fearjc: you can normaly do dungeons more than once at end game tho and thats what makes it a little odd in sod
[4:28:21] Karnalsyn: @Xaryu  What about a challenge where you can only use Rank 1 abilities?
[4:28:21] gorillamunchiez: @xwowkillax this is very cool but my internet can't handle it lol
[4:28:23] Nomad124: NotLikeThis
[4:28:27] iLtDan: after playing bloodsail buc and official hc i miss the addon days
[4:28:27] imbaman87: real life bank too? KEKW
[4:28:28] Bhajuman: What's up with raids?  1 and done?
[4:28:30] orreyo: did you get the bfd oil?
[4:28:36] Donho2: especially good on an rp server, once you kill a boss, it's dead
[4:28:36] Frank4LuLz: UES MAIL
[4:28:36] Sackztv: are you guys going to try and full clear?
[4:28:36] nim327: You can add bag slots to the bank?? Where has that been??

[4:28:40] nayge_: !gear
[4:28:40] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[4:28:40] gorz1677: its a cool rule considering vanilla developers thought players would only do dungeons one time anyway. Thats why vanilla dungeons are so large
[4:28:45] MrStLouis68: how are you going to buff people with scrolls if you cant trade with them
[4:28:45] sanoura: all alive for the raid?
[4:28:49] zerozuckerl: @gorillamunchiez LOL same here
[4:28:52] MattheusD: @xaryu a ton of greens drop in BFD btw, upgrades mid run
[4:28:52] bagenjoyer: 1 dungeon run and no quest loot is absolute dogshit no debate
[4:28:52] sacamano_eh: !sodcore
[4:28:53] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[4:28:56] RowdyGamingTTV: @Karnalsyn As a noob who left rank 1s on by accident, I would think that would be almost impossible. But again, still a noob.
[4:28:57] acaciashrub: @ninolarue i wanna know too ask again sometime
[4:29:02] woahmang1: @xaryu can we get final gear check? Cheers
[4:29:06] calamirlol: Have you watched Marvels @Xaryu
[4:29:08] minimusmax_: @Xaryu  Every 15 minutes
[4:29:10] evrgamerr: I find it interesting - players find ways to make this game difficult, to defeat the influence of bots and gold sellers
[4:29:10] Andy_BP: can u mail to ur self?
[4:29:10] orreyo: will u have a mage?
[4:29:10] esTeban30: @orreyo cannot be done with the rules , cause no trading and no recipe (inside BFD)
[4:29:12] SAMELLTV: ye
[4:29:12] johnnyzampano: 3
[4:29:13] calamirlol: Marvels Echo
[4:29:14] danielgodz90: isnt it once every hour
[4:29:14] leiferikson4541: its really nice
[4:29:16] itsmyriver: Nice scrolls
[4:29:17] TroyStory__: I like that, but the no quest loot makes my character strength very RNG
[4:29:19] orreyo: @esTeban30 true
[4:29:19] leiferikson4541: dont tell any 1
[4:29:21] NinoLaRue: @acaciashrub yessir haha I need the details here 🤣
[4:29:22] booderduder: wool bandages?
[4:29:25] xSomeLameNamex: there is a debate.
[4:29:29] beepo_gaming: Wait but BFD is a raid and not a dungeon technically now.
[4:29:29] Timeswipe: Truu
[4:29:30] bagenjoyer: they counter each other
[4:29:30] RealDadEnergy: new rule. can only use vendor once

[4:29:41] minimusmax_: @Xaryu  It resets every 15 minutes
[4:29:42] xSomeLameNamex: there's multiple other hc variants trying different ones and making it harder isn't a big deal
[4:29:49] DanPlaysChess: Type 123 if you are excited for Zaryu TO BEAT LORD KALERIS
[4:29:49] CubicleGangster: Damn, ring, robes, and shoulders
[4:29:52] Fromberg69: when are you raiding? :D
[4:29:53] Mahca_: it’s a nice rule for a personal challenge but wouldn’t want blizzard to force everyone to
[4:29:53] bagenjoyer: 1 dungeon run only makes sense if u can gear from quests legit
[4:29:53] Fluid710: TTours
[4:29:55] shloom995: where will the recruitment be for bfd if you lost some? @Xaryu
[4:29:56] jsonlee7: Did you debate over making it 2 or 3 per dung?
[4:29:57] LorkTheOrc: @xaryu how much mana do you have?
[4:29:59] kumah_1: that one idk
[4:30:00] EldritchBlaster: And the ring? That's fuckin awesome

[4:30:08] TurtleBearAU: No quest loot is great, otherwise everyone rocks up with the same gear and nothing is exciting
[4:30:09] Huechiii: is it one dung one time the whole time?
[4:30:11] TroyStory__: I understand the rule, I just don't like it lmao
[4:30:15] mitchellangelo42: getting the shoulder & robe from your one run of SFK must have felt electric
[4:30:16] Boot_XD: i think dungeon 1 time is lit but if u get through bfd u should be able todo it a few time like 4 limit
[4:30:16] itsmyriver: Can you get a better bag from a vendor?
[4:30:17] orreyo: i feel bad that you turned down the 5 int leather bracers sold in ratchet for like 30s when you were lvl 18.. :(
[4:30:19] H_9_K: I like the rules
[4:30:19] TheKraken2024: Warriors got owned by that rule
[4:30:24] charos__: Is sod is so easy why did yall both die 2,3,4 times till level 25
[4:30:25] Karnalsyn: @Xaryu  What about a challenge where you can only use Rank 1 abilities?
[4:30:27] MrStLouis68: @Huechiii ONE DUNG DUST TO DUST
[4:30:27] colt420x: I think no runes would be more challenging
[4:30:30] Kenithal: I feel like people that don't try HC don't realize how the restrictions make it feel more fun
[4:30:30] i_cook_up: 1. New Rule you can only scratch your butt 1 time per character.
[4:30:31] keredj: agreeed
[4:30:31] NickAle006: hi xar
[4:30:32] Svaenor: Making it more difficult has been a blast for us viewers. :)
[4:30:34] mxabs: What about allowing deaths in battlegrounds?
[4:30:38] sacamano_eh: no quest loot is a biiiit try hard
[4:30:39] RowdyGamingTTV: @charos__ because they didn't have quest loot lol
[4:30:45] TheFlavuhry: Guzu almost 50%
[4:30:45] orreyo: you should have bought those 5 int leather bracers in ratchet for 35s when u were lvl 18?
[4:30:46] S_Belwas: no blues from quests probably a decent middle ground
[4:30:47] charos__: Lol
[4:30:50] astraldex: amendment might be allowing quest loot as long as it's not dungeon quest
[4:30:50] evrgamerr: Exactly - no runes.
[4:30:51] DanPlaysChess: I'm about 95% sure Lord Kaleris gonna get ONE SHOT.
[4:30:55] calamirlol: @charos__ Because they had rules lol
[4:30:55] BoonesHQ: SoDcore is way fun to watch because its super difficult, you guys did a great job with great ideas
[4:30:57] weedah: no quest loot pushes people to professions more. its a win
[4:30:59] jdotno: I think an Only Quest loot is usable would be harder.
[4:31:01] etcdev: are you feral spec for the raid?
[4:31:03] TheFlavuhry: runes is the whole point
[4:31:04] jcadd_: whats in the bowl
[4:31:05] SneakyyDee33: is that just ground beef, rice and soy sauce?
[4:31:06] RealGenius76: RealGenius76 subscribed with Prime. 
[4:31:08] Colte455: @Xaryu Only quest loot
[4:31:09] espi: SOD no runes is just Era lol
[4:31:10] SAMELLTV: hahaha
[4:31:10] EJEazy_: current rule set is perfect
[4:31:10] FezzikGG: @Xaryu  can use all gear but only rank  1 spells could be spicy
[4:31:12] Bi0_: I've been thinking of doing an ironman challenge on sod with no runes...just cause.
[4:31:13] colt420x: Because it trivializes the content
[4:31:14] grimsleh: making the game more challenging is what makes it fun. You know any random mob can take you down at anytime
[4:31:17] LorkTheOrc: @xaryu how much mana do you have?
[4:31:17] alleyesonmeh1: beef and rice?

[4:31:37] MattheusD: @xaryu show talents
[4:31:37] callmedcd1: close up on your food
[4:31:37] Huechiii: SOD without runes sounds like ass
[4:31:42] ZarkXI: The hardcore rules suck for rogues because you need sfk for deadly brews so you have to waste sfk lockout for it
[4:31:43] Reaperz_kinetic: @colt420x that’s 100% incorrect… also no runs is just normal HC
[4:31:44] calamirlol: RAV is a madman
[4:31:44] therealkubzak: @Xaryu in how long is BFD raid for us EU viewers?

[4:31:55] Maiqthehighking: Can we get a zoom in on the bowl?
[4:31:58] rottenapplez89: 80/20 all day
[4:32:00] onkilldave: !server
[4:32:01] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA

[4:32:01] kumah_1: @Xaryu favorite chicken part?
[4:32:02] nreilly91: grass fed?
[4:32:03] pxrkerp: Why does the percent fat matter in beef?
[4:32:04] calamirlol: @therealkubzak Its around 22:30 CET
[4:32:06] evrgamerr: No Runes - because the player base would have a distinct advantage against you especially on a pvp server
[4:32:07] cyrax714: chochogoo attention seeking bruh died twu=ice
[4:32:14] epicninja808: did you find boots?

[4:32:21] magicks: I just don’t know what you’re gonna do next phase if you can only run gnomer once
[4:32:21] inspiredtv: get +3 str on bracers
[4:32:25] Luthia_: why did you switch to feral Xar? I missed that part
[4:32:28] gbaraldi1: I do like that currently dying isn't super super punishing

[4:32:37] brewfuzz: stretch
[4:32:37] exizee: better
[4:32:40] epicninja808: sepulcher vendor has boots
[4:32:45] fetza108: guzu is going hard
[4:32:46] exizee: use legs
[4:32:48] Fearjc: @DNuKeM91 what makes u think that
[4:32:49] exizee: for stam
[4:32:49] rnh_silky: Yo Xar, how you feel about middle eastern food, heathly or nah
[4:32:49] wubbawub32: @pxrkerp Fat equals flavor. 80/20 is more flavorful but more calorically dense and fatty than 90/10. Fat is choosing to be less healthy at the cost of enjoying richer goodness.
[4:32:50] rastomov: How late is it server time? Living in EU and can't see the clock with bags open :) go go BFD!
[4:32:52] EJEazy_: int = more dmg, right?
[4:32:59] Mahca_: +healing sucks as Druid this level without gear
[4:33:01] exizee: legs for stam
[4:33:03] FuegoDiego6: boys I’m dedicated. the phone died on the way home, downloaded twitch on fiancé phone to keep watching. W. WE ARE HERE @xaryu
[4:33:04] espi: @EJEazy_ no, only a tiny bit of crit
[4:33:04] calamirlol: @rastomov They raid around 22:30 CET
[4:33:04] orreyo: there is like no aoe in bfd? cept for 6th boss. but u want healing there
[4:33:10] kraegon1013: int also gives more mana pool
[4:33:11] xOutcoldx: i would do that or swap the bracers tbh
[4:33:11] smit0r: Keep heavy stam for turtle fight for sure
[4:33:12] kraegon1013: good call
[4:33:13] bbocmot2021: increases crit too
[4:33:13] thebigityguy: id go more int yeah
[4:33:15] DanPlaysChess: RIP KALERIS (get your dongers out in the chat)
[4:33:16] MrNerfHerder: you dont really want +healing as a druid i thought
[4:33:18] Donho2: what spec?
[4:33:18] petedelete2019: isnt healing + 18 HUGE at this level? @Xaryu
[4:33:19] yubash1ri: !SODCORE
[4:33:19] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[4:33:19] yoboiiroyalty: Everyone dying if  xar  is  healin
[4:33:20] bambirexkekw: id only put the stam on for 2ed and 6th boss
[4:33:21] grimsleh: I think blizzard should make an extreme hardcore server where it’s basically impossible to complete or survive unless you’re grouping with 2-3 people
[4:33:21] Rybeon: You doing any Feral during the raid?
[4:33:24] orreyo: @petedelete2019 yes
[4:33:27] Rewedy: Rewedy subscribed with Prime. 
[4:33:27] Scimitar325: I mean since you can't group up for the best quest rewards anyway I don't know if that would be necessary
[4:33:28] beepo_gaming: spirit = more MP5 which is what druids want
[4:33:28] exizee: legs for stam+crit
[4:33:33] evrgamerr: I think there was a Barbarian once who opted for a gear disadvantage?
[4:33:34] hsojxd: Int is just better
[4:33:38] zerozuckerl: Kappa check
[4:33:42] taintalization: +10 int is like 30 more starsurges!
[4:33:49] EJEazy_: @espi ofc but thats more benefical pve right?
[4:33:52] exizee: stam > int
[4:33:54] asystrolle: you have any fortitude elixirs?
[4:33:57] orreyo: u will die cuz oom/not enough healing, not from having low stamina
[4:33:57] unskilledplayy: SODHYPE
[4:33:57] exizee: I would say in hc
[4:33:58] morfius09: extra wild growth is wild
[4:34:01] eyepod: How much difference does the healing legs make on wild growth
[4:34:02] v3ndetta314: what exercises would you recommend for a beginner looking to get into bodyweight training?
[4:34:03] beepo_gaming: If you are only using mainly wild growth the +18 healing is not worth.
[4:34:03] Pauloozi: Plays cow in video game//also eats cow in real life RIP
[4:34:04] hicelldaddyty: how much health are u at @xaryu
[4:34:10] danielgodz90: he is lvl 24
[4:34:13] Tropicocity: Guzu is 40% through 24 atm
[4:34:14] jstuwie: guzu bout half way r
[4:34:17] kumah_1: 0 deaths let's go
[4:34:20] sizz420: spirit also benefits your mp5
[4:34:20] asystrolle: you have fort/wisdom elixirs?
[4:34:21] burnsthedude: I heard that + healing doesn’t scale well at these ranks spells
[4:34:24] wubbawub32: Yo is that Costco almond blueberry crunch cereal
[4:34:27] Philopinos: guzu has 600hp with stam buff, and aoe from turtle does 700 dmg :s
[4:34:28] zerozuckerl: @v3ndetta314 probably around +5 on every tick on average
[4:34:35] unskilledplayy: XARYU I BELIEVE IN U YOU CAN DO IT SODHYPE
[4:34:35] itsmyriver: No nekl3ss ?
[4:34:36] calamirlol: Dreamers belt is BIS for you rn
[4:34:40] ScryerTV: yes
[4:34:42] xOutcoldx: it is true
[4:34:43] Avgoustakis: why cant you see your health and mana?
[4:34:44] Jikario10: Mog is on point too
[4:34:47] butlerlog: Yeah int is everything at this level
[4:34:47] zerozuckerl: just dont heal
[4:34:50] beepo_gaming: +healing isn't worth on a druid with mainly hots.
[4:34:50] ziga_bm: they are both at the same spot 24 and about 50% to 25
[4:34:52] xOutcoldx: iont is better then + healing more casts is better then plus healing
[4:34:52] S_Belwas: only if you are casting healing touch or healing wave
[4:34:53] jeneraljelly: Spells that are below lvl 20 get less effectiveness from + helaing
[4:34:54] xSomeLameNamex: yeah, i wouldn't use + healing
[4:34:57] Mahca_: healing sucks this level, you over heal too much anyway
[4:34:57] prismo5: yes, +heal is awful here, int is by far the best stat
[4:34:58] nmitchell219: your so toast
[4:34:59] S_Belwas: big long casts
[4:34:59] ScryerTV: especially scales rly bad on hots
[4:34:59] Burninsummers: @Xaryu guzu almost halfway through sfk and to 25
[4:35:01] Octane33: could you just try it on yourself to check
[4:35:02] calamitygg: You just dont need +healing because base wildgrowth is insane @Xaryu
[4:35:03] obstata: its only worse than int if youre goin oom id think
[4:35:03] jwubb: you have stam buff
[4:35:06] EJEazy_: if your primary is dmg over heals, then int and spirit is better then stam and healing imo
[4:35:11] Fearjc: druid healing is also all wildgrowth and it heals enough already just need the mana to support it
[4:35:11] cyrusctff7: You rocking the invoker cloth pieces?
[4:35:11] smitttaa: how hyped for raid 1-10?
[4:35:17] calamirlol: Spam INT and Spirit tbh. You have a little over 1k hp in raid
[4:35:17] edott_live: Guzu is halfway till 25
[4:35:18] Huechiii: can you run a dung only one time?
[4:35:23] epicninja808: show boots?
[4:35:23] BoonesHQ: Spirit is the underrated attribute because you can regen mana, just gonna throw that out there
[4:35:28] Ariavo: It's mediocre because you're not downranking
[4:35:37] epicninja808: sepulcher vendor has boots
[4:35:37] prfssrzaddy: Every healer I know is using +healing
[4:35:38] evrgamerr: Anyway this is theoretical, but being in HC Elite early on in the addon development, it felt better on the old server
[4:35:41] FSP_888: is there a fixes roster ? so i can see who is in it ?
[4:35:42] Aevalous: not true.. its a trade off.. more +healing means you spend less mana
[4:35:47] exizee: no point of mana reg if you're playing boomkin in SoD ngl
[4:35:48] Fearjc: @BoonesHQ hes not speced into combat regen
[4:35:53] epicninja808: boots vendor is silverpine
[4:35:53] D_I_X_0_N: I feel like stats over spell power is a good call at lvl 25
[4:35:54] notyofriendguy: Check the healing difference in yourself, see if it's noticable
[4:35:58] beepo_gaming: +healing is only worth if you have BiS gear in other slots.
[4:35:58] JBergztrom: how the feeling about the raid mate?
[4:36:01] S_Belwas: Did you do all the dungeons you could?
[4:36:02] LorkTheOrc: Guys has anyone heard what level Guzu is? 🤔
[4:36:05] NOHEARTs4: owl bracers from hillsbrad vendor 5 int
[4:36:10] Jackfrost937: do the int boots for sure
[4:36:18] epicninja808: I think they are 5 agi or 5 stam not sure if there are more
[4:36:21] keredj: MODS ARE INSTAGIBBING PPL LOL
[4:36:22] L0pedogg: Stable boots +5 stam
[4:36:26] miadlofc: STAM boots
[4:36:26] espi: 5 stam or 5 agi
[4:36:27] MrLochte: guzu is lvl 24

[4:36:52] wubbawub32: Are you guys gathering or START TIME in 30 min?
[4:36:53] gorillamunchiez: are we doing predicts @Xaryu ?
[4:36:54] Oppositeness: hes half way through his level
[4:36:54] asystrolle: copy + paste Alexandre Lefevre <Leather Armor Merchant> at the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest
[4:36:55] BobbyPasta: What kind of predictions for the raid?
[4:36:55] exizee: Invokers Cord is crazy
[4:36:56] Thiccnuggie: KomodoHype good luck!
[4:36:56] twitchwarfoo: 1 pair is +5 stam and the other pair is +5 agi
[4:36:57] amagination_: i forget the addon, maybe chat knows but there is an addon to let u see what every vendor sells
[4:37:06] tedthebod: might want more 25 water too
[4:37:06] espi: remind everyone to bring like 60 lvl 25 water
[4:37:09] MiseSC2: does anyone know if DUOS/TRIOS can split up once they reach lvl 25 or lvl 60? or you stuck together forever
[4:37:25] SomthinSnazzay: Big mana pots in hillsbrad
[4:37:28] stevey221: im watching guzu do sfk and hes chilling. half way
[4:37:31] shloom995: @Mitchjones
[4:37:32] D_I_X_0_N: Prolly at least 1hr imo
[4:37:33] milkywaiz_tv: I just watched the youtube vid.. whats going on with ozzy now? he just died in deadmines??
[4:37:34] evrgamerr: Dying while soloing Dead Mines was unfortunate - hopefully he taped the dogs tail OR secured the internet connection
[4:37:34] TheKraken2024: Guzu @ 24.5
[4:37:35] reallyeric: aaaany minute tm
[4:37:39] XxLurK: do you eat the same thing for lunch every day?
[4:37:40] saggert: @MiseSC2 can split at max, at least thats how it was in unofficial
[4:37:40] mello_yollo: oz definitely grinded
[4:37:41] InfamousGandhi: i think your boots are better than what that vendor can sell
[4:37:41] robkluit1: is Mitch 25?
[4:37:42] OT4200: Don't forget to buy lvl 25 drink
[4:37:43] asystrolle: you have fortitude / wisdom elixirs tho?
[4:37:46] jthegov: What time raid today?
[4:37:47] stevey221: im worried about ozy tbh
[4:37:48] itsmyriver: Go get neck or head
[4:37:50] zerozuckerl: cows only drink milk @chat
[4:37:53] MattheusD: are you gonna be raid leader / caller?
[4:37:56] 141dan: !subs
[4:38:07] JoelinhoRL: what keyboard you use @xaryu ? sounds good
[4:38:09] ninjuhh_d4: Can anyone give me an estimated start time.  1 hour hour and a half?
[4:38:10] butlerlog: @booneshq the fights do not last long enough for spirit to remotely compete with int. 1 int is 15 mana. It takes 1 spirit 75 seconds without casting to get 15 mana back.
[4:38:13] D_I_X_0_N: Dying cuz dog dc is ruff
[4:38:20] robkluit1: it was kinda stupid.
[4:38:22] OT4200: Don't forget to buy lvl 25 drinks

[4:54:17] Thiccnuggie: Its okay he's feral there's no way he's pulling threat on turtle.
[4:54:20] bliss713: Is raid actually starting at 2:30 server now?

[4:54:44] CubicleGangster: you can only outrange the knockback
[4:54:45] wizardwaylon: you just don’t get hit up you still take dmg

[4:54:46] chickodie: EVEN FURTHER!!! BEYOND
[4:54:48] capitanrikko: Bro using quest items was not forbidden !
[4:54:49] iamXebra: @gorillamunchiez did you just not see the 25 druid running ahead of him directly to the rune?
[4:54:49] handstand_man: don't fight the turtle boss with the shore too close to your back.. otherwise bubbles will trap you against shore and ping pong easier..

[4:54:52] addycarry: the futher away you are the less damage u take
[4:54:54] SomthinSnazzay: Off tank would be nice
[4:54:54] overmitlig: 1 tank and pet is fine
[4:54:55] petstorehero: everyone takes dmg but melee should run out 15 yards so they dont get knocked all over and they arent doing dmg before shell breaks anyway
[4:54:55] epicninja808: dont let him get too many stacks in p2 akumi
[4:54:56] Aevalous: right
[4:54:59] gorillamunchiez: @bramicmar we can all only be so delusional
[4:54:59] Woah_Zerk: but the knockback into orbs is what kills
[4:55:00] iamXebra: @gorillamunchiez then proceed to attack the mobs around it?
[4:55:04] exizee: if you tank 2 nagas at the same time with only 1 tank you can legit get oneshit @Xaryu
[4:55:05] F4ILS4FE: Is Mitch going?
[4:55:05] epicninja808: he can get one shot very ez on akumi if he has too many stacks

[5:01:28] Woah_Zerk: to go from 15 to 25 in like 10 hours with professions and dungeon clears is pretty respectable. Guzu definitely locked it in

[5:01:43] crvyxn: @iamXebra you're not going to convince anyone you should really give it up. even xaryu admitted it was easier because he was streaming. just let it go it's just a bunch of fake rules for a video game.
[5:01:47] theinfiniteconsciousness: Guzu will walk past you at the road
[5:01:48] Gnosiis853: let's get it
[5:01:48] wing_tzu: Are there any other requirements to SoDcore besides no quest items? (and not dying obviously)
[5:01:49] Reaperz_kinetic: @iamxebra you’d have to be a higher level or 25 to follow him rn… to follow him to the SS you only need to be level 1… again do you even think before you type?

[7:58:31] oeBore: Wrath no mana op
[7:58:31] jimmysnowshoes: the hps doesn't make up for the lack of a dispel
[7:58:32] HDinHD: HDinHD subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[7:58:32] finde3315: Druid OP Xar, glad you enjoyed it
[7:58:32] GUGGERINHO: 5head strat
[7:58:33] familiaert: Its big, its not a number cruncher. But crazy solid
[7:58:35] P_u_z_z: ask savix what he thought of it
[7:58:35] kimahri25: @barcloch its 1.4 weapon speed. its either a rogue weapon or warrior weapon. .1 speed is not that much of a loss for 7dps upgrade. you stop talking lol
[7:58:36] chr47: maybe ask the people who died if the boomie was better than another priest LUL
[7:58:37] Fury_JP: whats your build?
[7:58:38] iPlayCuzFun: u played it really nice and good mana management
[7:58:39] Cross86: so what did you parse with this build @Xaryu
[7:58:40] Tamftw_: xarCOPIUM
[7:58:41] XialdinSR: @Xaryu someone said they were logging it, you should check out the logs
[7:58:41] Eliteshrimp: U could have healed more
[7:58:43] Skoemmy: its not really boomkin tho its just how u play resto
[7:58:43] G00DGooglyMoogly: dispels
[7:58:44] Thiccnuggie: Not as good as melee moonkin
[7:58:46] Naxonus: Sippy time boys
[7:58:46] asloff: Restokin, TM it
[7:58:46] RebornOG: rogue was standing in purple
[7:58:46] xberus19: def heal more
[7:58:46] TrippleNickelz: I thought healer mana was going to be key to survival
[7:58:47] Wallscast: you coulda saved people........
[7:58:48] Samelf218: Spamming wrath
[7:58:49] stevey221: yea
[7:58:50] daspaz: rav was too far, he was max melee so he wasnt tanking
[7:58:50] ManoPivaa: i use that same strat on normal SoD and run only 1 healer and me offheals
[7:58:50] DPTDave: been asking for clip for 20 mins and no one has it lol
[7:58:50] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu That's how Resto plays, you just framed it wrong with saying moonkin
[7:58:50] reach27: savix stood in the shadowcrash for too long
[7:58:51] xolossus00: much better than the melee healer with smites xdd
[7:58:52] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Dabuvix POV or u want yours? https://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousSeductiveScorpionMoreCowbell-FBmuFBme0dPAe0JX
[7:58:52] althehottie: big brain strat
[7:58:53] G00DGooglyMoogly: 3 had debudd
[7:58:53] Emil129c: watch guzu pov
[7:58:55] FurylordD: @Xaryu someone gifted 70 subs
[7:58:56] LemenTozen: no one would have died if people did not stand in shadow crash - the rogue
[7:58:56] Clarkeey10: needed for FAPs
[7:58:56] ProffBallsac: Faps
[7:58:57] jtz198: @xaryu solid but i think if your properly learnt druid they wouldnt have dies
[7:58:57] trafmcgee: you could have saved them lol spamming wrath
[7:58:57] sal_rl: too much stacking
[7:58:58] SheepyFD: you greed a bit in phase 2 with wrath, but that is fine
[7:58:59] BrigAndSigConnection: i agree, if you rolled priest, there would have been no deaths.
[7:59:01] Howlingcrown: was it the chains ?
[7:59:01] Bambambm: @Xaryu Why did none of the druids ever use Faeire fire? Wouldve been a good boost to physical dmg
[7:59:02] firebelgius: The position really fucked the melee
[7:59:03] MojoZeus: Nah Davix died bc he stacked boss and P2 has no aggro closest gets hit
[7:59:03] MonkeyOverlord: Tym would have saved himself but he forgot to put SPP on his bars
[7:59:05] ClayGore: if they all fapped there wouldnt be a need
[7:59:06] Dunpeel: melee shoulda use free action instead of SPP
[7:59:09] GUGGERINHO: shoulda had a mage
[7:59:12] rizzler90: @xaryu guys said he was getting LoSd based on positioning
[7:59:15] emarsh4308: You were blasting wrath and not healing at all either
[7:59:18] chr47: @tsetse2fly yeah xaryu just likes trolling and calling everything moonkin LUL
[7:59:18] Gi_Units: Guzu was being TOO Conservative with his mana pool.
[7:59:20] gbaraldi1: he didn't get healed
[7:59:22] mrbeggin89: Positioning was the problem
[7:59:22] OhZ0ne: He got a few resists on the dispell too.
[7:59:23] Qritique: @xaryu the strat killed you guys. People taking too much damage from being trapped, everyone should have just rotated around the center.
[7:59:25] crownhs: If your first wild growth in p2 hit group 1 rather than 2, there may have been fewer deaths
[7:59:26] k1ngdari: rogue dispell got resisted
[7:59:27] howdyhamburger: penance missed savix by like a second monkaS
[7:59:30] Silfic1: so he let one die bro
[7:59:30] classicx: its because they stacked
[7:59:31] nairbnitram: gotta see guzu reaction
[7:59:33] TuvaIaTimmy: yep all they needed to do was step back
[7:59:36] Pixiepantss: yikes
[7:59:38] TuvaIaTimmy: prox aggro
[7:59:40] sal_rl: They're WAY TOO CLOSE. you HAVE to spread here ad melee
[7:59:41] noxdeath: Gordon  could have shifted
[7:59:41] dusty9: Gordan dropped to like 1% wtf
[7:59:42] HelluvaWrecks: he got resists
[7:59:44] NGianga: why not fap on that fight
[7:59:46] sal_rl: Hes getting boss cleaved
[7:59:46] Keyostew: dispel then shield
[7:59:49] renebabeCoC: yeah and Jwub is using wild growth on g2 instead of g1 that has all melee and 3 chained targets. Look at his healing breakdown for kelris. He healed himself for the most
[7:59:50] Lycaonwtf: guzu got a resist on his 2nd dispel
[7:59:52] momogw300: its their fault
[7:59:54] zavior88: someone was saying that some of guzus dispells got resistet
[7:59:55] Maxlefou147: lag?
[7:59:56] mirre91: Isnt reviving pets on last boss kinda cheesy?
[7:59:56] momogw300: the had to max range dps
[7:59:57] TigerTomski: f
