[0:18:35] kaysiix: the biggest difference
[0:18:42] xDeceit: i feel like that with brew. so much fun playstyle wise but feels worse than the other tanks by quite a bit
[0:18:44] zachl_: sup my hoes
[0:18:44] flockheart: debuffs are on the side?
[0:18:45] Gnolde: @arabbit01 vantus for raid

[0:21:08] tomjb91: Does nick stream?
[0:21:12] xDeceit: is this the MDI team?
[0:21:16] ottomr1990: i feel like prot pally has had the same exact build since season 1 rework
[0:21:31] mk__9: bdk has no options
[0:21:33] kaysiix: nah , as pala u can change many stuff
[0:21:37] mk__9: you just pick the least bad talent
[0:21:39] Milano___: !mdi
[0:21:40] Nightbot: Watch the stream here! (we can't show it through Twitch) youtube.com/warcraft/live
[0:21:53] Cantwingrr: what choices would pally even make
[0:21:57] hivplus__: he streams farm sometimes
[0:21:59] Cruzerthebruzer: he's been streaming a little bit
[0:22:04] Spritesgud: HUH nick isn't on a healer
[0:22:07] zuzua90: pally has the best tier most of the time it’s just free damage
[0:22:11] Cruzerthebruzer: https://www.twitch.tv/nickc1 he's not streaming now though
[0:22:13] SmitikusPlays: Deciding between making Shockwave better or Shout better is hard. I think the problem is the tier set working with bleeds to do anything
[0:22:17] hivplus__: @tomjb91 nickc1 is his twitch
[0:22:17] kaysiix: @dorki ask drohgoh his opinion on ret , he thinks they gonna be meta
[0:22:38] A_Trask: inb4 Dorki has to play ret for MDI
[0:22:39] kaysiix: and i hope they are, ret feels good to play with
[0:22:48] Cruzerthebruzer: holy shit look at the NAMEPLATES
[0:22:51] jaydoeshair: gingi trying to gear a ret too
[0:22:54] zachl_: dorki turns on stream and just gets 1k people in here in 20 minutes
[0:22:58] zachl_: actual record
[0:22:58] Zozohnet: problem with paladin is the WoG talents. If they are ever good, healers will complain. Need to rethink the right side of the tree
[0:23:03] Cantwingrr: warrior I feel has always been very close this expansion to being OP, one wrongly timed buff and it'd be meta. but they were pretty strong with nerfing it when it seemed good
[0:23:03] flockheart: these nameplates brick me up
[0:23:26] SmitikusPlays: The real problem with wow is the lack of a shaman tank spec tbh
[0:23:33] hdott52: the nameplates lost a little weight, they are skinner
[0:23:36] kaysiix: chat do u know how i can get those AMAZING super NICE , crazy GOOD nameplate ?
[0:23:45] zachl_: the real problem with wow is that they removed boon of the ascended
[0:23:51] zuzua90: prot war, ww monk, shamans, and to some extent even warlocks aren’t really good for mythic plus
[0:23:52] hivplus__: IMBOONING
[0:23:53] zachl_: that was where it all went wrong
[0:23:57] Cantwingrr: I would probably triple the size of them
[0:24:18] Cruzerthebruzer: @zachl_ if they didn't remove boon they surely wouldn't have ruined the game with augmentation evoker
[0:24:21] AnxenTv: !talents
[0:24:22] Nightbot: check my youtube video for m+ talent builds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ceV-oLFB6g
[0:24:29] Cantwingrr: @zuzua90 in what context? in season 1 enhance was one of the best specs to play
[0:24:29] SlobberOnIt: wtf is that wolf coming out of you HAHA
[0:24:38] Cantwingrr: inside Dorki there are two wolves
[0:24:40] hdott52: can we gamba number of drohgoh deaths for this key?
[0:24:42] ottomr1990: one improvement i might suggest mr streamer is that your cat needs to take up like twice as much space as it does now
[0:24:44] b3tamn: !mdi
[0:24:45] Nightbot: Watch the stream here! (we can't show it through Twitch) youtube.com/warcraft/live

[0:24:48] tomjb91: Im blind Shit so i gotta have big nameplates
[0:25:00] zuzua90: @cantwingrr shamans always have only one defense
[0:25:07] zachl_: @cruzerthebruzer aug is fun + game was 50% less fun when they removed boon
[0:25:12] zachl_: anyone who hates aug hates life
[0:25:13] zachl_: idk
[0:25:15] jaydoeshair: when is first mdi weekend?
[0:25:22] Cruzerthebruzer: aug ruins raid
[0:25:24] A_Trask: I really like Naowh UI nameplates #ad
[0:25:27] syzurup: is boomy slowly becoming like WW monks where their raid spot is fading away?
[0:25:36] hdott52: remeber when you can get the urh relic and just giga blast while using boon?
[0:25:41] zachl_: @cruzerthebruzer raid ICANT worst content in the game
[0:25:51] flawlesslykun: @A_Trask i heard i really likes boomkins too PepeLaugh
[0:25:56] flawlesslykun: he *

[0:35:54] zuzua90: dorki is healing next key
[0:35:55] Egx__: could be because warriors cant do afflicted and its lfg
[0:36:15] Egx__: and warrior isnt meta so ppl are being cringe even for lower keys
[0:36:21] cajovysacok: i will miss afflicted so mutch   its the best afix i love when it spawn when people get deadly dot on boss and everyone is deing
[0:36:21] cataphract1014: pull all 3 cowards
[0:36:29] zuzua90: I don’t get why blizzard makes affixes and then doesn’t let certain classes deal with them
[0:36:47] Razzeu: @kozagor you see, problem is the LFG people, like lego isnt needed BUT they would probably take w/e ppl use in r1 keys in a 22 Aware

[0:46:01] Dalmerica: Its about the sound
[0:46:03] BLACKFOOT_TN: Hi Dorki. I hope your doing well today.
[0:46:09] zachl_: @zachl_ ooh what we playin
[0:46:10] Ciqq: Hey Dorki, what's better, to hear conquer your enemies, to see them drive before you, or to hear the screams and lamenting of their children?

[0:48:21] zachl_: @zachl_ the issue is ibraco, that in least in my mediocre opinion, that pugs wont really reach the level where tuning will matter; but i do see what ur saying, and also would like tuning
[0:48:24] Cruzerthebruzer: who on your team is confident, just drohgoh surely?

[0:49:04] ibracohiba: @zachl_ as example EB 2nd boss is just constantly casting - without comms there is no way you get proper interrupts, and the bolts hurt like hell
[0:49:04] c0jaK: that's the gm of gang activity watch out
[0:49:05] allyparser: just put smacked on drogoh duty, he would LOVE that
[0:49:10] juno_sha: dorki is a true mommy
[0:49:10] Hyvest: @zachl_ Spiky damage patterns still suck at lower keys, especially when you have anti-defensive gamers in 22s-24s

[0:49:42] zachl_: @zachl_ @Hyvest look i totally agree with u guys, and wish theyd tune. but to blizzard those are non issues because keys at 17-22 are too free
[0:49:58] zuzua90: I picture drogoh as that guy from zombies the movie that can’t speak English
[0:50:03] eggs_boiled: HEALERS this emote is so good HEALERS

[1:17:09] kittkattklunk: question: dorki your mentioned that you can use silence sigil to interrupt mobs like this trio boss if the silence sigil only hits one mob during its cast. can that be used on other casters like the trio sisters in Waycrest or the soulcharmers as well?

[1:17:43] zuzua90: it’s not the speed of the route it’s the motion of the ocean
[1:17:46] Hoshma46: neltharus was good until it became just chains
[1:18:01] K4lsdern: nokhud was so good and so bad at the same time
[1:18:06] zuzua90: who doesn’t like chains
[1:18:06] zwappes: any dungeon where items kill all the mobs just sucks
[1:18:07] Urebaldd: I didn't even play S1 EZ
[1:18:11] Razzeu: PepeLa tbf i was doing piss keys then, think my highest neltharus was 25 BUT i loved the chains gathering Kreygasm
[1:18:25] Arkshol: Nokhud was trash all along
[1:18:31] Sens121: @dorki is that wa for party cc private?
[1:18:42] zuzua90: nokud was just a prison
[1:19:11] Hoshma46: I loved nokhud final boss as a prot warrior, the reflects were instant dopamine
[1:19:13] Razzeu: Suske why u guys didnt like neltharus tho?
[1:19:24] Hoshma46: @Razzeu chains trivialized it
[1:19:28] Morayeden: @Razzeu Chains became the entire dungeon
[1:19:28] Urebaldd: Too much fire and tall people
[1:19:29] Razzeu: so?

[1:19:56] zuzua90: dorki brick the key?
[1:20:03] IAmSolari: bro the brewmaster 2 set is so insane
[1:20:05] Morayeden: Also the 2nd boss always bugging out
[1:20:06] patachonota: do you full moon on ce And dont wait for pulsar or burst?
[1:20:06] NkKouros: "chains trivialized it" then 99% of people didnt do it above 25
[1:20:12] kittkattklunk: awesome thank you!
[1:20:36] Shaians: it does work even if it lands on multiple target tho doesnt it?
[1:20:37] Hoshma46: @NkKouros you are correct, 99% of people dont do above 25
[1:20:51] gremons: @NkKouros timed it on a 29 and chains trivialized it compared to the other dungeons
[1:20:53] Shaians: as long as mob is casting I guess
[1:21:03] batmanxz33: Feelings on ret pally in high keys? 27s and above . Hopefully the buff fixes our single target a bit lmao

[1:21:13] GLomnar: do we know next season dungeons?
[1:21:19] Vexusprime: @GLomnar no
[1:21:26] Cruzerthebruzer: any dungeon that kills itself is bad
[1:21:33] jannekvarnc: is zerging one guy in eb council fight the way? or better to swap   to get kicks on the casting guy?
[1:21:33] Cruzerthebruzer: junkyard, neltharus, necrotic wake
[1:21:36] juno_sha: Remove chains Madge
[1:21:56] Minigamer911: Who hated on Junkyard?

[1:22:16] IAmSolari: is the cheat death trinket kind of mandatory in mega high keys for tanks
[1:22:17] Razzeu: @Urebaldd OMEGALUL
[1:22:17] zwappes: fucking tol dagor cannons man
[1:22:21] zuzua90: nethralus I’d watch dorki do like a 12 death first pull and still time the key
[1:22:24] Morayeden: Tol Dagor
[1:22:26] Morayeden: Brooo
[1:22:29] nerefwow: does Kyrian Weapons stream?
[1:22:36] Galois_rg: SD and HOA were goated
[1:22:41] EmmaZen: I liked Junkyard
[1:22:42] juno_sha: I like TD with TD PepeLa
[1:22:44] Urebaldd: The wolf boss area was annoying
[1:22:44] reppap: junkyard would have been a banger without the bots
[1:22:45] Morayeden: That last boss fucked
[1:22:51] Serenitylol: does kyrian weapons stream?
[1:22:55] Minigamer911: Tol Dagor before the cannons got gimped to 5 shots
[1:23:13] zuzua90: barrel simulator boss
[1:23:14] xijkz1: TD AINTNOWAY
[1:23:17] zwappes: just be a DH and blade dance the shoots on last boss xdd
[1:23:21] twopineapples: gambit murloc pulls ae where its at
[1:23:30] javybavy: a lot of these dungeons were not meant for M+ at all, like even dawn was not really designed for it
[1:23:42] zuzua90: dorki wants back motherlode
[1:23:43] nirail: Have you tried Phial of Icy Preservation for survivability?
[1:23:58] zachl_: gambit was S tier
[1:24:01] Vexusprime: @javybavy 100% dawn was designed as an rp dungeon
[1:24:03] Morayeden: Gambit? Nah great dungeon
[1:24:06] twopineapples: numbers go big
[1:24:06] juno_sha: Gambit is dumb
[1:24:07] reppap: they should just stop dungeon weapons like NW spears from scaling in m+
[1:24:07] zachl_: undisputed gambit is s tier
[1:24:08] oneygaming: gambit is a bange
[1:24:09] Galois_rg: gambit wasn't fun to heal, but it was a good key
[1:24:09] Cruzerthebruzer: 1st boss sucked but was good
[1:24:09] zwappes: i dislike the dragon boss, otherwise very good
[1:24:10] Vexusprime: gambit ws a banger
[1:24:13] Urebaldd: I liked it but pugging the last boss was hard
[1:24:15] oneygaming: is qa blueprint for better dungeons
[1:24:16] Vexusprime: gambit and streets were both amazing
[1:24:17] Shaians: no but running mobs are shite
[1:24:23] Serenitylol: fuck calling shit out for pugs on 1st boss tho
[1:24:24] EmmaZen: streets fucked
[1:24:25] juno_sha: REMOVE FISHSTICK AND IT"S S TIER
[1:24:28] twopineapples: streets had way too much rp
[1:24:30] Minigamer911: Gambit after murlock area was fine.
[1:24:34] NkKouros: survival hunters refusing to do the soaks were a special phenomenon to see
[1:24:48] oneygaming: murlco area is WHY gambit was sick
[1:24:48] asurarey_24: speaking of gambit, what’s your best murloc impression
[1:24:54] javybavy: streets had all the bad parts so gambit could be S tier
[1:24:59] IAmSolari: @NkKouros but they're there to SURVIVE why go in the bad :)
[1:25:02] Minigamer911: Waterlogged areas where I randomly swim because someone transformed me in to a gnome RAGEY
[1:25:05] zuzua90: I want them to do a mythic plus season of the three icc dungeons
[1:25:17] Urebaldd: First boss in streets was great when I couldn't see my weapon
[1:25:20] daveisfaker: speaking of gambit, what’s your best murloc impression
[1:25:28] zuzua90: halls of reflection, pit of saron, and soul of forge
[1:25:35] zuzua90: forge of souls
[1:25:42] nerefwow: 30 rise monkaS
[1:25:53] othernewname: what about a Dorki + Morchi emote, call it Dorchi xdd
[1:25:58] Urebaldd: monkaChrist
[1:25:59] Vexusprime: i want an m+ season where they bring back halls of atonement, gambit, and like maw of souls, big pulls fast key
[1:26:01] IAmSolari: can we do gamba
[1:26:13] zwappes: i want a season with seat of the triumvirate just to see how the most difficult legion dungeon stacks up towards "modern" m+ dungeons
[1:26:23] aidenbx: maw of souls best istance
[1:26:36] aidenbx: second boss one shot with scythe
[1:26:39] aidenbx: frontal
[1:26:39] Vexusprime: @zwappes probably hell for the first 2 weeks before they realize they forgot to tune it PepeLaugh
[1:26:42] Morayeden: Maw of Souls sounds like pure nostalgia from people

[1:27:01] KaladinHS: this key impossible
[1:27:19] zwappes: Maw of souls is good until after 1st boss and u get on the boat and get 1 shot by the dude that puts the shit on the floor
[1:27:20] Morayeden: All the legion M+ dungeons have been mid at best so far
[1:27:27] Minigamer911: Maw of Souls had some jank
[1:27:29] Morayeden: I don't see the hype
[1:27:31] Minigamer911: Like the barrels
[1:27:41] aidenbx: do you know what was the best thing in legion ?
[1:28:14] zuzua90: I don’t want mythic plus cataclysmic change my mind
[1:28:26] Archmage_Michael: yo, how was your weekend?
[1:28:36] aidenbx: all classes was strong warriors hunters dks all classes was so strong on legion
[1:28:43] Vexusprime: well most of the dungeons they bring back aren't the same cause they change the mechanics/tune them differently
[1:28:45] aidenbx: right now exist meta classes and this is bad
[1:28:46] Minigamer911: Vault of the Wardens in rotation Prayge
[1:28:49] Vexusprime: also cause classes played differently back then
[1:29:03] zamow1994: you couldnt reroll to fotm classes in legion
[1:29:06] zuzua90: imagine doing a cataclysm dungeon on a bolstering week
[1:29:08] zamow1994: different game really
[1:29:18] zwappes: legion m+ outside of legion really isnt that great, what made legion m+ good is that the classes were almost all great, they played great etc etc
[1:29:23] Morayeden: People were also worse players back then
[1:29:24] EmElw: man give me blue elysian decree again
[1:29:40] Vexusprime: classes were also all uncapped back then
[1:29:44] LightdarkGaming: how about from tomorrow we change to resto druid+SP :D
[1:29:45] aidenbx: yes bro i play only war arms in legio never change now i have around 4 characters and dont know wich one i need to play
[1:29:47] Vexusprime: so you could pull like half the dungeon and go wild
[1:30:26] zwappes: so many toots damn

[1:31:58] batmanxz33: It's insane how many pugs this boss has killed for me. People can't seem to grasp the concept of fuckin baiting frontals. Even in 26s and 27s
[1:31:58] similar_001: kekw

[1:32:31] Cruzerthebruzer: wonder how much hp you lived with had to have been like 500 or something
[1:32:41] jannekvarnc: grabbing the orbs when they are close is kinda risky no?
[1:33:17] ATouchOfJaffa: how important are stats and trinkets for boomie? can i just try changing my weap as a bear or will it be ass
[1:33:49] SoviOso: which tank would you recommend learning for m+ pugging? To learn and use, i mean.
[1:34:18] zwappes: i cut my hair today for the first time in 3 years, FeelsGoodMan feeling the breeze on my scalp again
[1:34:23] GooseComics: @SoviOso you can learn and use on anytank really. just whatever you feel the most comfortable with
[1:34:30] khannivore: @zwappes Feels breezy man
[1:34:32] zuzua90: just use addons and raid bots to think for you
[1:34:34] ATouchOfJaffa: i would always say prot paladin for pug tanks they have so much
[1:34:46] Vexusprime: @zwappes get a buzzcut
[1:34:55] zwappes: @zwappes thats exactly what i got
[1:34:55] LAPSLO: @dorki how u use mirror + branch for m+ ?
[1:35:03] Vexusprime: @zwappes baseg
[1:35:27] se_enginheiro: Maybe on not bolstering losing 1 lust is fine
[1:35:49] SoviOso: i was trying to decide between Prot Paladin and Guardian Druid.
[1:36:18] roguerhino: guardian is supposed to be the "easiest" tank but its whatever you enjoy
[1:36:30] ATouchOfJaffa: so ive heard you can dmg the adds with the orb from this and ive never been able to do it or it looks like it does nothing
[1:36:39] lockjaw570: @dorki is ellesmere still playing?
[1:36:49] IAmSolari: @SoviOso it doesn't matter until you get to like +25  really, both are fun, play what you like more
[1:36:50] nerefwow: Wokege
[1:36:58] EmElw: it does pretty good damage, few % on hit

[1:37:09] Morayeden: Things you hear before you die: "Volly!"

[4:37:30] bignuge11: @dorki is MW or Hpriest easier to heal right now?
[4:37:41] weezie_61: Double cheat is worse for damage and survivability. Also, if your grp dies you lose 2 cheats. I can link you guys really good Surv build if you want. You will get Feed, DGB and Fraility with Double sigils. But dmg is lower.
[4:37:44] zuzua90: meele tax

[4:39:27] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61  I agree with the dam los and I see wat you mean I have 2 big DPS builds and one super tanky one for higher keys but then you pull more so the deeps isint that big of a los . Please link it to me would like to check it out
[4:39:46] weezie_61: ok, give me a min.
[4:41:23] Aggroboy: @blitzxkreig easier rotation is subjective, but hpriest is one of the best specs for reactive healing... MW has a bit of a windup with soothe-env-viv
[4:42:03] Aggroboy: ask Growl tho, im just a weekly +20 chatter
[4:42:48] ninemoreminutes: lmao love that he has boss dam blacklisted on details here
[4:43:22] blightedfog: dorki been grinding palworld or what
[4:43:25] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee This is super tanky build, You will have 100% uptime on spikes, still have Soul crush for Boss', and get Sigils with DGB.

[4:46:22] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee Yes but with cheat you lose 2 points. Extra Feed does nothing but overcap spikes.
[4:47:04] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee Also you cant get Soul Crush
[4:47:11] Farva_Shenanigans: no more ret keys

[4:49:08] coy93: Thoughts on Ele Sham?
[4:49:09] zuzua90: boss took forever to kill
[4:49:48] Aggroboy: Yazma is so punishing in PuGs
[4:49:49] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61  wat is your st more or less with it tho? My st is very bad I can only do 100k ATM with a Aug like 120 max
[4:49:58] justdiscforfun: dorki do u prefer bolstering or fortified sanguine?
[4:50:23] goop: LMAO
[4:50:24] justdiscforfun: hahahahahha
[4:50:28] Rikachizzle: he doesnt know
[4:50:29] juno_sha: BAN
[4:50:34] misran: do you prefer getting kicks in the nuts or the nose
[4:50:36] ohfoeshow: would u chop off ur left or right hand
[4:50:44] Rikachizzle: i guess that'
[4:50:51] vallin_: what about necrotic? YEP
[4:50:52] juno_sha: How do these chats go by, but i get banned for existing RAGEY
[4:51:02] Theliahh: How do these chats go by, but i get banned for existing RAGEY

[4:51:42] oneshotelitee: Next week and this week's keys are and wil be aids
[4:51:46] Aggroboy: funny that necrotic is a non-affix for DKs
[4:51:50] gretriku: give @juno_sha mod as a birthday gift
[4:51:53] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee ST will be higher than Cheat Build becasue ofDmg buff from Soul Crush, but is lower than High dmg builds because you will still want to spam Soul Cleave for Soul crush stacks but are not getting Focused cleave dmg buff.
[4:51:56] oneshotelitee: After that we can play the game
[4:51:59] Theliahh: @Aggroboy necrotic? Susge
[4:52:00] trentbail23: imagine tyrannical, incorporeal and afflicted.
[4:52:07] goop: necrotic doesnt exist anymore chat
[4:52:07] Barmarcc: Tyran is so mid its crazy, even if next weeks affixs are bad
[4:52:09] goop: what timeline are we in
[4:52:12] Ehsanfury: I would take anything over sanguine YEP
[4:52:16] juno_sha: FeelsBirthdayMan monkaGun
[4:52:20] Liryns: one where I don't want to exist
[4:52:22] Aggroboy: we back in Shadowlands
[4:52:47] Frawtarius: If only Aug didn't exist Sadge
[4:52:48] goop: now we get exciting affixes like incorp and afflicted that only certain classes can deal with
[4:52:52] xD1V1NEx: spicy take, swap in necrotic over bolstering
[4:52:53] goop: isnt that much more interesting?
[4:52:59] vallin_: thundering Pog
[4:52:59] justdiscforfun: but i have exciting news 1 more pain week before a good week

[4:53:27] yyllaaa: is it possible to push on next week sanguine
[4:53:38] justdiscforfun: everything is possible
[4:53:43] Ruinx81: Incorporeal is worst
[4:53:50] justdiscforfun: but achievable will be hard
[4:53:50] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee Pretty much SB on AOE and Soul Cleave on ST.
[4:54:18] oneshotelitee: Yea and that's the dh rotation in a nutshell 😂😂

[4:55:48] justdiscforfun: lol
[4:55:56] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61  I'll probably be up for another 20mins  it's already 5 am here
[4:55:57] Barmarcc: @justdiscforfun Brew is good rn but it doesnt bring insane utility like vdh and prot
[4:56:01] Aggroboy: druids are squishy FeelsBadMan
[4:56:16] trentbail23: @justdiscforfun they all should be good. kinda crazy how its just one or two out of 6
[4:56:16] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee Here you go for max DMG https://clips.twitch.tv/GenerousOpenTermitePupper-rMewCS2asJfC3lf9

[4:56:25] Haseus_: next season only dungeon is sanguine depths, the variation is its random affixes every key
[4:56:27] weezie_61: Use nerf build and follow his guide
[4:56:46] juno_sha: DRAMA? SNIFFA
[4:56:58] stagpul: DRAMA? Looking
[4:57:16] Ruinx81: Drama let’s fucking gooooo
[4:57:29] blightedfog: DRAMA? SNIFFA
[4:57:30] thetorque162: DRAMA?
[4:57:34] gretriku: DRAMA?
[4:57:36] Cruzerthebruzer: DRAMA? kok
[4:57:45] Aggroboy: Brew isn't good imo, having grinded one recently
[4:57:53] clickermekk: Drama?? Where
[4:58:01] xD1V1NEx: @Aggroboy if you arent the best you are bad
[4:58:09] Ehsanfury: Where ? SNIFFA
[4:58:26] Aggroboy: @xD1V1NEx id settle for middle of the pack
[4:58:33] Barmarcc: @Aggroboy brew can do just one keystone lower than the two best tanks can rn
[4:58:49] xD1V1NEx: @Aggroboy thats where brew is
[4:59:03] Aggroboy: no its bottom two
[4:59:10] trentbail23: ya like 5 brewmasters might be able to get in the top 100. sounds right.
[4:59:33] xD1V1NEx: brew is fine
[4:59:43] LuciFeariUm: LuciFeariUm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! baseg
[4:59:55] xD1V1NEx: the good tank players that can pilot it properly are either OTPs or rerolled to the meta tank
[4:59:57] K4lsdern: every tank is fine but not every tank has sigils
[4:59:58] mr_gagrik: EZ
[5:00:10] Alawichu: firstGarf
[5:00:53] Aggroboy: i disagree, i don't think brew is in a good spot atm
[5:01:11] xD1V1NEx: @Aggroboy i play with the best brew in oce and he says its in a good spot
[5:01:16] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61 I see but do you just spam sigil then you don't mind it overlapping?  And if I open with sigil hunt is that fine ?
[5:01:17] Barmarcc: @Aggroboy Nah the top 2 are just broken utility
[5:01:18] xD1V1NEx: its just not as good as prot pally or vdh
[5:01:23] trentbail23: every tank doesnt have 5 ways from sunday to stop enemies lol.
[5:01:31] Brolosophy: is ww an actual play?
[5:02:30] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee You can double Sigil on pull with FB buff and you will get 3rd right when they expire. But if you are not spending enough Fury you will want to hold it a few seconds.
[5:02:31] Archmage_Michael: do you think double sigil for VDH is here to stay?
[5:02:39] Onslaught2000: hehe i place blue crayon drawing on ground hehexd
[5:02:40] xD1V1NEx: @Archmage_Michael hell nah
[5:02:42] Theliahh: Binoculous
[5:02:44] CrackedOrb: what if DH did beans damage
[5:02:47] juno_sha: Binoculous
[5:03:22] Archmage_Michael: @xD1V1NEx it will feel weird if they take that away.
[5:03:30] Zarroe: KEKW
[5:03:35] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee You dont really want to pull with SoF. Because you want the debuff on all mobs. Wait until you get them grp'd
[5:03:40] blightedfog: KEKW
[5:03:43] blightedfog: its planned
[5:03:53] stagpul: LOGIN
[5:03:55] stoviglie: what is the build to play in 20s on vdh?
[5:03:59] weezie_61: But you can if you are pulling like 4 grps and have nothing to pull with
[5:03:59] Kalletenz: has there ever been a season where blood was on top of the meta? Haven't player for that long yet so idk
[5:04:00] Aggroboy: @xD1V1NEx you play with BEEONN?
[5:04:18] xD1V1NEx: @Aggroboy yes
[5:04:22] RazaDazza: man, I want to like d4 so bad but I hate it. it’s so dull.
[5:04:39] stoviglie: meaning, when is it worth to drop damage talents for the cheat death?
[5:04:42] Archmage_Michael: @Kalletenz Shadowlands Season 3 and 4 !. not that long ago
[5:04:49] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61  I'm decent with using my fury  so it doesn't "waist" a sigil when you stack them it's more dam ? Sorry for the stupid question
[5:05:29] weezie_61: Yeah, it is more dmg becasue it is getting buffed by 50% from FB & Ascending Flame
[5:05:48] BLACKFOOT_TN: That's what.....Dorki said wtfwtfwtf
[5:05:51] oneshotelitee: I thank you I'll def try it later
[5:06:43] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee Also, Nerf will build Souls, then Decree, but he will double Bomb back to back while decree is on 1 sec delay
[5:07:00] weezie_61: for SB dmg in FB window
[5:08:36] trentbail23: funny how this dungeon is super easy on low levels but turns up so much later
[5:08:47] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee If you run my super tanky build it doesnt matter because you do not have FB spread. So you can just focus on keeping it active.
[5:09:42] oneshotelitee: The tanky build is def wat I'll be practicing more I need to double check the deeps one but my aoe dam is bonkers
[5:10:17] oneshotelitee: I'll give it a test  in the morning
[5:10:33] weezie_61: ok, hope the keys go well for you
[5:11:58] oneshotelitee: I will not be doing high keys lol 20 max 😂😂 when I failed my 6th 23 key this week I decided that I wil not be pushing any keys this week and next week lol 😂 after that I'll try to get it all on 26,27
[5:12:21] bluewahfull: is there any drama today chief, i need just a crumb
[5:13:03] Pleasehold96: so whats the determination to run cheat death instead of soul cleave build??
[5:14:08] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee Once you get to 26/27 timer starts to get tighter on Rise & Throne. but others should be easy in time.
[5:15:18] Nightbot: dorkiHey Join my Discord server! https://discord.gg/yHFTAZn
[5:15:20] weezie_61: Also DHT timer has been a problem for me but that is due to not being able to skip Keepers all the time
[5:15:28] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61  I don't know if I'll be able to pug it lol I have 1 26 timed so far (fall)  struggling with groups badly
[5:15:32] bootymcboatface22: I love this pull
[5:15:42] Aggroboy: big WM pulls HOLY
[5:16:08] Nightbot: dorkiCheer Subscribe to my YouTube channel! @ https://www.youtube.com/c/Dorki
[5:16:12] weezie_61: Once you get to 26+ the Pug DPS actually know what to do. so it gets a little easier
[5:16:40] weezie_61: but there are much less keys in Que, so you will need to do your own often
[5:17:15] murloc_oracle: @Pleasehold96 2 points in Feed the demon= perma demon spike uptime, last resort is just a bonus
[5:17:24] weezie_61: It kinda sucks without a grp becasue you cant reroll a bunch of keys
[5:17:37] oneshotelitee: I hope so need to get all dungs up so I'll actually get invites tho  if I get to a point where I comfortabley time a 26 I'll try and make a solit group
[5:18:00] oneshotelitee: Where you just spend the day pushing
[5:18:30] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61  do you pug aswel?
[5:19:23] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee I do, I have some people I play with but we all are not on at the same time often.

[5:21:07] oneshotelitee: @weezie_61  pug life is so hard sometimes they are great but most of the time it's horrible and I have this thing that when I get a really good group I tend to go braindead 😂😂
[5:22:37] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee yeah, sometimes playing with people that are like 3600+ and they are spamming "tank?" in chat makes you not want to go back into a key. I just try to learn from them if they are not being Toxic. otherwise I just ignore and move on
[5:22:52] buttsauced: @weezie_61 nice gear.. but you might want to enchant your helm
[5:22:54] Razzastar: is monk streaming?
[5:23:15] zeoliveirajunior: best music, iron maiden

[5:25:40] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee Here you go. https://raider.io/characters/us/illidan/Weezdh
[5:25:45] oneshotelitee: Thanks
[5:26:19] jenkinsdonuttv: This boss is monkaSville
[5:26:27] weezie_61: You can go back and look at my pug routes also. So you can compare them to streamer routes. Sometimes Streamer routes just dont work for us civvies
[5:26:54] Micosj: 5 min dungeon fight YEP
[5:28:08] chrono_za: LMAO
[5:28:18] manlyhandles: damn

[5:30:08] IXYl: ty
[5:30:41] Micosj: What is this triple tank key?
[5:31:44] weezie_61: @oneshotelitee I am running thrown axe for the Agi because it is 489. It is a little less dmg than Timestrike but I think the additional Agility is worth it for me.
[5:31:55] weezie_61: Also the other one has Speed Stat on it
[5:32:22] Falothuss: Hi Dorki! As i am trying to to pug keys as a tank, which tank would you prefer more: prot pala or veng dh? (around 23-26 keys)
[5:33:34] vikster: everybody in pvp using weakauras that tell you everything everyone is pressing...not fun
[5:33:35] Kerecsen: @Falothuss Te is feladtad a healt 22 felett, mint én? :D
[5:33:45] Falothuss: can you tell me why?

[5:47:43] zachl_: or cba thatspec in m+ still
[5:49:28] m_dep: dude bolstering is my favorite affix too
[5:49:39] GoaGifflar: adding 6% dmg to 0 dmg isnt gonna do much
[5:51:38] trentbail23: same as frost DK it needed like 10% damage not 4
[5:51:41] Micosj: Make it a support spec

[5:53:32] toastbam: bloodtalons is just hella cringe
[5:53:47] toastbam: in all situations
[5:53:52] saevenar: Bloodtalons is one of those skills that works really well in single target and feels horrible in aoe
[5:54:21] hdott52: how many times has greg asked to die this key?
[5:54:26] saevenar: I wish there as an alternative that was viable for all content, though. It's not my favorite thing to work with in raid either
[5:54:38] zachl_: ok do i have to like regen combo points to get those free bites or rakes
[5:54:43] zachl_: or are they max cp

[6:01:57] assrug: nono d4 is big bait trust
[6:02:44] assrug: bursting is not compareable to sanguine or bolstering though
[6:03:15] mea1903: sanguin+forti, next week will be worse
[6:03:27] Urebaldd: Bursting isn't so bad anymore
[6:03:29] trentbail23: bursting isnt bad in higher keys.
[6:03:29] LordAnomandaris: Non healer take
[6:03:31] IXYl: Where do u fit felblade into the rotation
[6:03:36] Aggroboy: bursting is great for organized groups, but terribad for pugs
[6:03:45] assrug: bursting just is not a timeloss
[6:04:00] assrug: sanguine and bolstering is
[6:04:17] hdott52: "its not about fun, its about IO" sounds like Ambitions team moto

[6:04:39] Theliahh: I'm so Oldge now, time for Bedge gn dorki and chat FeelsBirthdayMan
[6:04:41] toastbam: Dorki that's a good healer take. But for all of us in the back ya know.

[6:05:37] Ale2104: No
[6:05:40] nautiigaming: yes
[6:05:40] trentbail23: i did my highest keys this week.
[6:05:41] Galois_rg: I only pug in the 3600-3700 range, and bursting is absolutelly a push week
[6:05:43] Janeeboy: For pugs bursting is a skip week
[6:05:43] magic_mac: yes
[6:05:44] toastbam: I def try. But we die a lot
[6:05:44] Coltron5: it is a push week 100% other affixes are dog shit ]
[6:05:44] slowpoke_exde: yes
[6:05:45] awesomeoohh: i feel like bursting isn't even a big deal at higher keys
[6:05:45] bootymcboatface22: for me yes, ima mistweaver ez pz
[6:05:46] BriGuy271: Yes, it depends on the tank
[6:05:47] numenusty: every week I try to push some keys
[6:05:47] Urebaldd: I've not had any trouble pugging bursting really
[6:05:49] Tofterid: Not in eb KEKW
[6:05:49] Genesis1_: 100% push week, push my heal to limit
[6:05:50] Thowarr: If you're below title, every week is push week
[6:05:59] Aggroboy: bursting is pretty bad for pugs 17-20, but above that DPS are smart enough to reduce stack rolling
[6:06:02] Archerone: there are no push weeks, only painge
[6:06:04] The_Reemer: bursting is always good dont listen to the healers
[6:06:04] Janeeboy: Next week as a boomkin is a push week
[6:06:05] xijkz1: entangling
[6:06:10] dirtydeus: anything with volcanic
[6:06:10] Micosj: There are no good pug weeks anymore lmao
[6:06:11] cj894884: As Aug only push week is raging in pugs
[6:06:30] mea1903: EB's bosses need nerf
[6:06:36] Bames01: im barely 2.7k io, my opinion doesn't matter...but bursting weeks i can'
[6:06:53] trentbail23: @Bames01 all opinions matter.
[6:06:55] Bames01: i can't fully dps correclty cuz im sandbagging
[6:07:02] assrug: bursting is i menace in low-midrange keys
[6:07:02] Holandija: Fort/volc/spiteful might be the easiest week
[6:07:06] Micosj: Amen
[6:07:08] Micosj: Remove affixes
[6:07:08] Janeeboy: Depends on the seasonal affix tho... OHH WAIT
[6:07:18] Thowarr: Ellesmere had a good segment on Titanforge about affixes and m+ in general
[6:07:18] magic_mac: I like the Ellesmere take on affixes
[6:07:21] deepcalm: anything except sanguine tbh
[6:07:24] magic_mac: 1 affix + seasonal affix is best
[6:07:27] deepcalm: prot pally perspective
[6:07:31] Urebaldd: Bolstering and sanguine are balls
[6:07:39] dirtydeus: is it sanguine incorp? next reset
[6:07:45] Urebaldd: Yes
[6:07:45] sky1___: Next week is cursed
[6:07:51] sky1___: @dirtydeus YEP
[6:08:08] The_Reemer: bad affixes give me an excuse to take a week or two off
[6:08:17] Urebaldd: Blizzard instead added two new shit affixes in DF
[6:08:18] Gythwulf: I'm also a big 0 affix guy
[6:08:20] dirtydeus: that’s not terrible just annoying
[6:08:23] assrug: tbh i think keys would get borring super fast without affixes
[6:08:27] ShabsieAU: imagine a cursed season with all the worst affixes returning
[6:08:28] Galois_rg: I don't want to take 1-2 weeks off, I want to KEY
[6:08:29] Coltron5: you’re also fucked if you miss push week
[6:08:31] The_Reemer: then i get a month or two off
[6:08:31] redapples28: then you take alot of weeks off
[6:08:35] Coltron5: wait 4 months for another one
[6:08:37] iqsound: solution is to raid
[6:08:42] deepcalm: they should have let the community vote on affixes kek
[6:08:46] Thowarr: If every week is a bad affix, maybe they should put some effort into fixing them
[6:08:48] Janeeboy: Volcanic is a push week usually, but I despise it as a boomkin... horrible design
[6:08:48] Aggroboy: anyone remember Teeming ? Was it bad?
[6:08:59] Bames01: what if blizzard gave us the option to choose the affixes each week out of a selection...maybe change the selection each week
[6:09:02] stagpul: NOPERS
[6:09:08] assrug: having atleast 5 retards in your raid is biggest affix in game
[6:09:11] Camelbak21: @Aggroboy yes
[6:09:11] Coltron5: teeming was bad bc pug tanks couldn’t get count right ever
[6:09:14] LordAnomandaris: Most of the playerbase would hit their peak early on in M+ if affixes went away. That is prob why Blizzard have it still in the game.
[6:09:20] ShabsieAU: What if raids had affixes? They could call it.. season of fate
[6:09:34] toastbam: dont you remember gromnaks video
[6:09:36] xCzeron: Rotate affixes each week, let you choose any level 1 above your best
[6:09:42] xCzeron: like gw2 fractals
[6:09:52] dirtydeus: bolstering blows
[6:09:53] xsetikx: weird to see WW pumping again
[6:09:56] Janeeboy: Bring back Skittish and Necrotic KAPPA
[6:10:00] Sohen: ditch affixes, make positive augments. buff scaling to compensate

[6:10:38] Thowarr: Part of the problem is that Blizz still operates under the kiss/curse philosophy, but there's no kiss. It's all curse.
[6:10:42] garyhn: o yeah the guy who one target dummins in m+ is online YEAH!!!!!
[6:10:50] garyhn: want*
[6:11:11] Bames01: kite first boss to last boss?
[6:11:33] Sohen: NOTED
[6:11:58] garyhn: no i love the challenge of hard content
[6:11:59] hdott52: thundering
[6:12:09] Galois_rg: I wish they would bring back old necrotic, it added such a great flavor to the tank gameplay
[6:12:09] garyhn: yes i do
[6:12:10] The_Loony_Bin: bring back explosive
[6:12:13] Micosj: @garyhn So make the content hard instead of artificially inflating it
[6:12:23] NorthernSM: bring back skittish
[6:12:31] garyhn: none like i said i just like the cahallenge of m+ ne in difficult
[6:12:34] erdls: my fav affix is next week incorporal sanguine, peak fun- love it
[6:12:37] garyhn: be in*
[6:12:41] toastbam: so you dont like affixes
[6:12:42] Denz_9: there was a two hour period one week last season where all keys had no affixes, best 3 keys of my life
[6:12:45] xCzeron: So you dont actually like affixes lol
[6:12:58] Galois_rg: @Denz_9 these hours were omega pog
[6:12:59] Vathee: Reaping for more ignite dmg
[6:13:04] Janeeboy: Just play a hunter so you have no affixes :D
[6:13:12] Thowarr: @Denz_9 I remember that; was the best of times
[6:13:13] eggs_boiled: i like pbe fortified + tyra :3
[6:13:14] xCzeron: @Janeeboy Can do incorp gg
[6:13:15] grymnjow98: hey dorki, do you have a talent build command or anything? or could possibly show talents rq?
[6:13:16] Zoqhan: Necotic would be the bis affix to get back, solo easy and free keys!!!
[6:13:28] hdott52: encryptic my favorite affix altime
[6:13:30] Janeeboy: @xCzeron Can but from my experience too lazy to do :D
[6:14:12] eggs_boiled: tree + 2 idiots ICANT
[6:14:16] isfer: just remove tyran and fortified.... i mean, why affixes that does more hp dmg buffs if the basic system of m+ is alredy about that?

[6:47:38] xenshea: much appreciated
[6:48:54] ItsYent: I wish u could bolster the boss
[6:49:54] ItsYent: imagine he got bolstered and became like deathwing size
[6:49:57] spampurge: yeah why not bolster a boss on tyran week that sounds free
[6:50:07] ItsYent: content
[6:50:26] illidanfromgorgonnash: I wish bolstering was permanent
[6:50:30] BLACKFOOT_TN: Yeah it's already a bitch to find a healer in pugs. Why not make shit worse?
[6:50:44] ItsYent: bolstering isn’t shit for a healer what 😂😂
[6:50:49] ItsYent: it’s shit for the tank
[6:51:19] BLACKFOOT_TN: Tell that to the healers that disappear when this week comes around.
[6:51:27] BLACKFOOT_TN: And the tanks.
[6:51:41] ItsYent: feel like last week causes more healers to disappear
[6:51:42] BLACKFOOT_TN: But hey glad you think its lawls.
[6:51:53] Shimorta: cant wait for sanguine fortified next week!
[6:52:13] ItsYent: idk never had a healer say they don’t wanna play cuz of bolster
[6:52:16] Odinslayer: how do you play with no music?
[6:52:40] kj01a: the sounds of dying mobs is music
[6:53:13] deepcalm: people who play music while in comms should be on a watchlist
[6:53:14] BLACKFOOT_TN: You must be lucky to know healers that 1. Still play. 2. Don't mind healing all the time. 3. Don't care about the afixes. Bro your gigga rich in friends.
[6:53:46] ItsYent: so you think healers hate holster as much as bursting
[6:53:48] BLACKFOOT_TN: Tell them to que up in pugs. Would be great.
[6:55:06] BLACKFOOT_TN: I think healers hate bolstering, bursting, volcanic, afflicted, and any other fucking affix that makes them have to do anything OTHER than healing. But hey that's just my experience.
[6:55:30] ItsYent: what do healers do for bolstering ?
[6:56:15] BLACKFOOT_TN: Pump the tanks dick with tranqs. Cause the DPS are always mongos and never stop before gigga bolstering shit.
[6:57:12] ItsYent: afflicted I can understand but bolster I see as a tank /DPS issue
[6:57:14] kj01a: by that logic they should love bolstering because it makes them heal more
[6:57:23] ItsYent: right lol
[6:57:26] enkelidraws: cant heal one shots XD
[6:57:27] c3rby_: Healers hate healing
[6:57:32] Ehsanfury: xdd
[6:57:32] c3rby_: But they dont know it
[6:57:36] Cowslapping: dorkster pull xdd
[6:57:43] c3rby_: So they lash  out against everyone else in the aprty
[6:58:03] nahrniarcg: @c3rby_ as a healer. no defensive = madge
[6:58:39] c3rby_: As a all around player, you can only control yourself. If its not a one shot and a pugger try and outplay it
[6:58:53] c3rby_: by giga healin more. We all deal with bad pugs
[6:59:55] nahrniarcg: @c3rby_ premade :p dont have to. but they still annoying with defensives ngl
[7:00:13] c3rby_: Yep everyone makes mistakes
[7:00:14] c3rby_: part of it
[7:00:24] c3rby_: dont get madge
[7:01:18] Chewbaccaw: healers have no say
[7:01:20] Chewbaccaw: please adjust
[7:01:22] Chewbaccaw: thank you
[7:02:20] enkelidraws: you will compensate for every mistake and smile while doing it

[7:03:49] prvpr_: it can
[7:03:57] sativas: yes, it can be
[7:03:59] c3rby_: In japan "YOU CAN"
[7:04:00] moki_3: how the fuck you deal so much dmg
[7:04:01] ItsYent: a guy plays one on stream
[7:04:09] DoubleProGG: boomie is so vulnerable right ?
[7:04:10] iTsGRANT: @Chewbaccaw I currently play on a controller, 3080 io
[7:04:22] HarveyPls: what can you do in japan dorki
[7:04:26] Chewbaccaw: @iTsGRANT hes him
[7:04:26] c3rby_: he said

[7:04:53] kj01a: send me money and I will smile for you
[7:04:54] sativas: I used to play grandtheft auto san andreas on ps2 with a steering wheel, to get out and run around I used to have to zig the wheel back and forth lol
[7:05:04] TCGRebel: i miss living in japan, one of the best places ive lived
[7:05:10] AkuTVgg: i’m moving there for work in may for 18mo
[7:05:11] BLACKFOOT_TN: In Germany you can guy a BJ and sex for $50.
[7:05:22] BLACKFOOT_TN: So I guess Japan wins?
[7:05:24] sativas: of course I played with a regular controller most of the time but it was fun to mess around with alternate controls
[7:05:40] DoubleProGG: first boss in everbloom is such a joke and all other are overtuned no ? what u wanna do to oneshots when i dont have and defs left :D
[7:06:11] c3rby_: From what ive heard its giga hard to get a citizenship for outsiders tho
[7:06:16] nahrniarcg: 3rd and last boss in eb will get nerfed soon
[7:06:30] Tocketimer: Tocketimer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! i just bought a smile :)
[7:06:31] BLACKFOOT_TN: The US conversion was insane back when Germany still used the Deutchmark.
[7:06:34] TCGRebel: @c3rby_ it can be
[7:06:36] TBouse: very hard to do that fight without rageheart as rdruid
[7:06:53] Tocketimer: true true
[7:07:05] LAPSLO: dorki dont have a zip for install all of his ui at one right ?
[7:07:13] kallisz: @DoubleProGG imo if they fixed this boss with consistent damage 2nd and 3rd is fine, 2nd might be a little to much imo with all the coordination. 4th is stupid and i hate it
[7:07:16] Soresu3: This dungeon seems ridiculously hard with bolster. I've been trying to time a 20 for this dungeon for 3 days lol
[7:07:38] BLACKFOOT_TN: I watch allot Japan content. Seems the conversion is allot closer these days. But still good.
[7:08:47] gigawatersoaker7777: Dorki do you have any pokemon cards
[7:10:07] kj01a: whats your best card?
[7:10:18] BLACKFOOT_TN: You gonna try that Palworld game?
[7:10:24] c3rby_: I remember when my house got robbed as a kid, and they took all my pokemon cards
[7:10:36] c3rby_: And my tv
[7:10:40] c3rby_: Which was a CRT
[7:10:43] SillySmiffy: Tyrannical fights at that key level feel like 43 minute fights.
