[0:44:59] ChairmanofGaming: I have an update on the all Tauren guild / raid. I am currently chat banned. Because when I am looking for pugs for our raids, I am getting right click reported by people who don't play Tauren who ask for a spot and I politely decline them. In the right click report I am being reported for racism. So in trying to run a Tauren only raid, I have become my server's most prolific digital racist.

[1:43:25] brakealot: @brakealot many prefer 19-20lvl + but I would just make my own grp its very easy
[1:43:26] ohioliving: league is cancer
[1:43:28] Tinkeyyyy: I think his success is more recent, Who knows maybe he will go full time or he makes alot of money in his current job
[1:43:32] CptBananaKing: yeah but that happed after the wow series, before ha had like 100k
[1:43:33] HughHefner01: keeping in touch with reality
[1:43:38] saltb0mber: what time is the raid?
[1:43:38] t4pekid: Well since we dont know Ravs voice or his face he probably is Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos rl
[1:43:45] Janniwow: is the raid today 7/7 or 5/7? @Guzu
[1:43:47] ewilgodtv: Or a fun real job

[1:44:02] Dinomight3: @Tinkeyyyy 'his league videos have been successful way before wow lol
[1:44:03] evildufus: @ewilgodtv do these exist? Lol
[1:44:04] RayLawn: guzu do you still think you will make the raid? it is getting closer and closer.
[1:44:10] Blubhui: do you enjoy your Job Guzu?
[1:44:13] Pansars: on a serious note, maybe streamers should tip/pay a little to creators for showing clips their work as part of their stream
[1:44:17] NilzVentura: perhaps he owns a stripclub?
[1:44:22] saltb0mber: so 6 and a Half hours to go
[1:44:25] kwantom75: Ravs YouTube is completely de-monetized  for some of the stuff he said in his earlier league career. Been a Rav enjoyed for 3 years. He has alternate YouTube for financial and ads. He does okay. Sure he just enjoys the job he has.
[1:44:29] ascension_girl: how is priest to level 1-25? @Guzu

[1:46:05] TheWhiteRabbitxX: yeah a TON of people have lauded Asmon for their foothold in the content creator space because of that
[1:46:10] mlady_telegramz97: THE ONLY GNOME I ACCEPT
[1:46:11] jtstroud: @Guzu i get the whole ask first thing, i also feel most ppl would be cool with you reacting

[1:46:24] EfeGamii: barny the goat
[1:46:31] Ragi_Fz: A lot of people forget that you can talk to be people reacting to you. IIRC Nixxiom did the same thing and asked Asmon not to react for a small while
[1:46:38] zoob32: @guzu ravs videos got reacted to by all the wow creators and now he's running his own events
[1:46:40] paperclipey: @EfeGamii is he posting again
[1:46:47] PopmycherryYO: hello @Guzu  I remember a viewer was looking for a sink. Did you hook the person up, or are you still keeping it for yourself? Cus I am kinda invested, and I still remember you promised to give the person a sink, so they could wash their hands.
[1:46:49] paperclipey: barny legitimately best wow content to ever come out
[1:46:55] taylorsdank: reactions help everyone involved as long as the people reacting are genuine

[2:26:31] Blufootgaming: Cheer300 Parable: Hurriedly, the streamer ran backward and forward, stealing mob tags and getting to 25 in time for raid. Little did he know, his lack of preparation would lead to the demise of 7 players when both healers run out of mana on Kelris. This could've been avoided if the streamer simply used his private jet to get home, not chumming it up with the plebeians.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù  I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.
