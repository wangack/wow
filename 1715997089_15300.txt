[4:20:10] biirrd: my hype is with the starwars game Massive working on. Hope it will be good.. I dont understand why it was not on the list

[4:20:11] doecdoe1: !pw
[4:20:22] itsyoboywill: echo

[4:21:03] rLeo2: If any of them gets released
[4:21:04] Yosbo: can you play it online with multiple ppl? ifso then its a mmo
[4:21:07] rLeo2: thats a big IF
[4:21:10] Shrenko: it is
[4:21:23] TheCliffyShow: I don't play League of Legends but I might check out the Riot MMO. LoL does look like it has an interesting world and some nice waifus.
[4:21:33] Rudric_Ice: it is but is not marketed as one
[4:21:37] biirrd: Avatar was not on the list, and starwars was not on the list. guess  they are passt 2024
[4:21:44] EscapePlan01: @Yosbo not massively though?
[4:21:46] Heero_Effect: So Diablo 4 will be like Diablo immortal. Just better?
[4:21:47] Kanrad: when in the open world you are playing with other people in D4 only dungeons are instanced
[4:21:47] ArcaneMaki: MoP Tavern music was so goofy but good
[4:21:55] biirrd: Massive is making on, and they are making the Avatar game to
[4:22:02] Tripl3dot: oh shoot gotta go train my whelp
[4:22:07] tmiguel27: Nop i think it was the next game for the Jedi Fallen Order
[4:22:15] Kanrad: D4 is 100% an MMO
[4:22:37] Bernardo994: i swear if they fuck me on diablo like they did WOW with al the BS that hapened
[4:22:39] Dred_Scythe: It's an ARPG using MMO elements to pad out its content. Doesn't have big raids. World Bosses can be done in simple groups like World Bosses in WoW. So very light on the MMO side.
[4:22:39] Yosbo: @EscapePlan01 Well thats the thing you could in theory play it online with thousands of ppl just not at the same time so its a grey area
[4:22:46] rLeo2: You keeping that scene Tow?
[4:22:48] falldrgn: I think D4 is one of those is g oing t o do well no matter what

[4:23:36] Kanrad: D4 World bosses increase in difficulty the more players that engage them. Like how World Bosses and some rares work in WoW
[4:23:37] EscapePlan01: @Yosbo I know its kinda semantics but Elden Ring has online elements with possibly thousands of other players but its not an MMO. Like I said, not that it really matters anyway but yeh never thought of it as an MMO

[4:24:33] Dred_Scythe: @Kanrad There not that difficult, and only 8 players can fight them at most. So the tuning is way different.
[4:24:50] Rudric_Ice: just bcuz a game can be played online is not an mmo then ican say DayZ is an mmo Rust is an mmo

[4:34:17] c0mmander_starscream: Hopefully they have a faction like the "Railroad" in Fallout 4 in starfield so I can wipe them out again
[4:34:22] shortyforthewin: battlepass is only for xbox right ?
[4:34:29] snake_like: Pepehand I only have so much vacation to use
[4:34:31] mavericks312: @MedicineMan name the last bethesda game not riddled with bugs

[4:35:08] tmiguel27: I think is mistaking Battle Pass with Game Pass LUL

[6:22:38] hezzoyam: guy had the flush with K high, you have an Ace?
[6:22:38] mavenspicks: better to gamble now before the blinds get too high
[6:22:40] Sollice: No because everyone is going for flush
[6:22:43] smashwow: yeah it's a connector and suited
[6:22:46] smashwow: fuck it
[6:22:58] TheFunkyCrusher420: Some ass clown just called all in with 7 5 vs my QQ hit runner flush. So rigged
[6:23:06] pokerkeg: No, the bounty is worth more than 1st place payout. They will be shoving a lot wider than usual @Towelliee
[6:23:07] smashwow: sometimes you gotta gamble
[6:23:09] BluffAlwayz: 45 os im all in

[6:23:57] Sollice: @cho_reese_oh Thats exactly right lol
[6:24:02] smashwow: tourny play in a big setting you gotta be willing to go all in with a wider range of hands
[6:24:14] smashwow: connectors + suited = good hands
[6:24:29] leetenkey: A lot of streamers give their 5 bouties in the first 20 minutes, then play for real.    But i'd rather wait til at my table too.
[6:24:47] smashwow: online yes
[6:24:48] pokerkeg: Are you not trying give up any ACR bounty money? Lol
[6:24:50] smashwow: live no
[6:24:55] smashwow: cash no
[6:25:13] cho_reese_oh: not in a 200 person tourney. but in a 2000 person tourney people are just trying to chip up
[6:25:14] YodaCards: The thinking has changed a bit from when you played PS and FTP.  A lot of the charts are saying hands like A2-A5 suited are 3-bet candidates about 20-30% of the time.
[6:25:15] TheFunkyCrusher420: Bruh quit acting like you a pro @smashwow
[6:25:28] Lulaboo: hey dont talk shit dudes
[6:25:35] aliquippapokerplayer: @smashwow What? You got it backwards, dude. There is a wider range of hands played in cash than tourney poker.

[6:27:27] YodaCards: Yeah, they get pretty nuts towards the end.  But with 4 minute blind increases, they get high fast
[6:27:33] dontquit1972: probably cuz they are on their last $2

[6:32:37] PotatoWin: thats his name now
[6:32:37] pokerkeg: @pokerkeg Obviously. My point is with (5) $1K bounties on your head, you'd think the range should be a little wider than normal. Especially with them not having to deposit any money. This isnt out of anyones pocket except ACR lol
[6:32:42] JasperXIII: cards

[6:49:00] YodaCards: There is a BIG difference between the tournaments from the last 2 weeks vs the early ones.  During the first set of freerolls, when someone busted, like a streamer, they didn't get moved tables.  They would stay on the same table, so the players who would take their bounties would have enough chips to take another bounty.

[7:54:33] leetenkey: Towelliee, with all your Titch followers, you should set up a "backing" for the Main Event poker.   There are websites where you can set up account.   People can buy shares of your action.   So you might invest 1k of your own money, and investers get a portion of what they invested.   You can offer them straight deal(1% for every $100) or skewed(.8% for every $100)
[7:54:35] drhoser: 675 spots paid
