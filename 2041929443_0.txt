[0:33:35] edd_3000: What's up Arthars! Did you try season of discovery? I don't feel like I've seen you playing Classic. Did you have any interest with it?
[0:33:38] Zenthon_Prime: @dogege_1 brute force practice for me, can't speak for everyone tho. I started doing wow movement tech needlessly in XIV lol
[0:33:47] Synnove_K: the time sakareth was kill by 300 guild only 100 have kill fyrakk
[0:34:18] Yllidan: who is the luster for the group?
[0:34:26] SCMSV: sepulcher felt similar

[0:40:56] Zenthon_Prime: heroic definitely feels easier than savage
[0:41:03] Zenthon_Prime: mythic idk
[0:41:16] RasnerG: @Zenthon_Prime heroic is just normal mode with 1 more mech
[0:41:39] Synnove_K: heroic for me even fyrakk feel easier than extreme
[0:41:50] Zenthon_Prime: i think my first tier being voti with heroic raz tricked me into thinking heroic was harder than it actually is
[0:42:37] Zenthon_Prime: yeah razageth felt 3rd floor savage
[0:42:44] RasnerG: razageth was fun
[0:42:49] RasnerG: council is a mistake on design
[0:44:30] RasnerG: man would be funny if that shadow drops off the arena xD

[0:56:10] cactuar7: did you guys clear tindral before nerf?
[0:56:12] mercurialllll: How hard is this fight in terms of FF raids
[0:56:59] Aggroxcraig: I'm doing this fight heroic with some casual friends. I agree. It's pretty meh compared to Tindrel.

[1:22:27] wynterdream: KEKW
[1:24:13] RasnerG: i stopped using elvui since somehow it started doing some weird stuff on my game
[1:25:56] ZeroNpcTV: @RasnerGaming what weird stuff
[1:26:21] RasnerG: it kinda broke and started to  give me lua errors
[1:26:34] RasnerG: so i switched back to the default ui
[1:26:51] ZeroNpcTV: if elvui dead just use bartender xdd
[1:26:54] ZeroNpcTV: or default
[1:27:56] RasnerG: yeah i went back to default XD
[1:28:37] LiquidSnack54: i made the choice of quitting ffxiv. i sold my account after uh 11 years it helped me through some tough times but boy oh boy am i burned out
[1:29:16] MaDJaM13: @LiquidSnack54 Burned out or Bored out?
[1:29:20] ZeroNpcTV: @LiquidSnack54 why you sell your account
[1:29:40] LiquidSnack54: just so i cant ocme back to it and both
[1:30:02] MaDJaM13: Well, someone will need to get a new account with incoming FFXIV DT.
[1:30:33] ZeroNpcTV: i am right now only playing WoW for raid and never do any m+ unless im pushing 3k io
[1:31:18] LiquidSnack54: yeah i'e come back to WoW xD i havent touched it since Legion and it's fun... i love healing in WOW i realize that

[1:32:40] LiquidSnack54: Yeah i sold one with legacy tattoo gobbue and and the sub xD howwever i have another one that i "actually use" but it still depends i wanna see some changes to 14 tbh
[1:33:12] tresborn: @LiquidSnack54 well dont expect any changes lol
[1:33:31] LiquidSnack54: yeah i figured thats how its gonna go
[1:33:47] ZeroNpcTV: the only change is Graphics
[1:33:57] ZeroNpcTV: just click it
[1:33:57] KDFox417: 7.0 is the dev's maintenance while they set things up for 8.0 xffing
[1:34:00] LiquidSnack54: 7..0 feels like the gaara kidnap arc xD
[1:34:07] StreamStickers: Get in on the action by slapping a Stream Sticker! Type !stickers to learn how.
[1:34:11] LiquidSnack54: build up arc
[1:34:13] ZeroNpcTV: ohh
[1:34:15] ZeroNpcTV: idk xD
[1:35:04] LiquidSnack54: i remember a retarded macro i made back in wotlk that just spammed the word bonestorm until i got muted in BGs xD
[1:35:31] ZeroNpcTV: i dont think you can do anything for that macro
[1:35:39] MaDJaM13: DT will overwhelm you with content. If you are a completionist (like me), you are done. That might be the last expansion where I levelcap every jobs.
[1:35:44] ZeroNpcTV: or maybe you need to make a sequence but idk
[1:36:31] tresborn: classic phys ranged braindead in every game
[1:37:23] LiquidSnack54: my friend is doing mythic fyrakk too from what i heard and his constant 10 hour raid nights (i also live in SEA) its rough
[1:38:34] ZeroNpcTV: 10 hour raid? a day? goddamn
[1:38:37] LiquidSnack54: apparently that 10 hour is just for shits adn giggles and since its mostly a filipino guild everyone is late like an hour xD
[1:39:14] KDFox417: new pc for wow huhh
[1:39:21] LiquidSnack54: he's gearing me up to join him but boy i am not excited my wife is gonna kill me if i play for 10 hours a night xD
[1:39:51] LiquidSnack54: btw is it a mandela effect or at some point we got a bejeweled addonn for WoW thats not sanctioned
[1:40:02] RasnerG: i mean wow optimization is kinda weird, valdrakken is a mess when it does the first load xD
[1:40:16] ZeroNpcTV: in wow i can only do 3 hour raid because you need to have 20 people for optimal prog
[1:40:19] MaDJaM13: Well 10 hours raid nights, do you mean preping gears and buffs (food) and strategies and rotation and hotbars for 7 hours and raid for 3 hours6
[1:40:25] MaDJaM13: ?
[1:40:53] MaDJaM13: Hardcore preparation for Hardcore execution like back in the days.
[1:41:37] LiquidSnack54: Yeah i told him i can do probably 3-5 hours but i cant commit 10 hour nights considering i have a business (a toystore) on mornings xD
[1:43:11] LiquidSnack54: what hurts me the most in progression is after 3-4 wipes where evveryone is hyped then they settle down and everyone just starts becoming potatos
[1:43:18] wynterdream: 10 hours is defo a thing for full time gamers LUL
[1:43:31] ZeroNpcTV: for full time gamer ofcourse
[1:43:35] KDFox417: whats midcore? its hardcore or casual xffing
[1:43:46] wynterdream: like housewives, students (who don't study) etc
[1:44:08] LiquidSnack54: the funnny thing is back when i was a college student i could raid 7-9 hours
[1:44:59] LiquidSnack54: This arthars guy is good reminds me of a certain ninja
[1:45:15] wynterdream: if you were one of those students who raided 10 hrs a day, either your coursework is super light, or.... LUL
[1:45:27] LiquidSnack54: I was a nursing student at the time tbh xD
[1:45:44] Stormer81: What class is he playing, I can't tell with WoW
[1:45:44] ZeroNpcTV: @LiquidSnack54 damn
[1:45:48] MaDJaM13: I'm a parttime gamer. irl is a bitch but I'm not complaining. but yeah, a week of raid includes a lot of prep before raid time. If I'm not ready and at the top of my game during raid time, I'm making everyone else waste their time.
[1:46:09] ZeroNpcTV: i can definitely do 7 hour raid on weekend
[1:46:18] ZeroNpcTV: but on weekday 3 hours only xdd
[1:46:30] wynterdream: @ZeroNpcTV We talking about daily. At least i was
[1:46:37] LiquidSnack54: I think he is playig Hunter
[1:46:40] wynterdream: Weekends are defo doable
[1:46:45] MaDJaM13: Making the static of PUG wipe 2 times in a row because of me. Unacceptable.
[1:47:07] StreamElements: Check out my wishlist at https://jointhrone.com/arthars REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE GIFTS artharsPrayge
[1:48:12] wynterdream: YEP
[1:48:58] ZeroNpcTV: its a casual for you but hardcore for wow players? like that i think
[1:49:07] LiquidSnack54: WoW is a different beast comign back to it, there's a big difference in mentality on how to get that "clear" i see guilds sitting people out and all that probably becasue those guilds havve a rotating roster of some sort
[1:49:10] MaDJaM13: I have a casual gaming schedule but I have a hardcore execution.
[1:49:11] LightXIV__: every guild does like 2-3 days max
[1:49:37] devillad666: my 14 group is one day 3 hours, so I'm stuck in pf hell because i really enjoy playing the game
[1:49:42] wynterdream: I think xiv has the most full time gamers i've seen in endgame. Never realised I was such a filthy casual until i played xiv KEKW
[1:50:16] sinrias: @devillad666 oh i feel that, it's why i'm glad i ended up joining a second static. tho it fell apart but i managed to prog faster and clear the tier.
[1:50:35] MaDJaM13: Yes!
[1:50:43] LightXIV__: 9h weekly minimum tbh
[1:50:49] wynterdream: YEP
[1:50:54] lawlietLinucs: YEP
[1:50:55] MasameC: true
[1:51:06] MaDJaM13: 3 hours, 3-4 times a week. That's it
[1:51:48] wynterdream: I tried out for one casual static... their level of skill is just KEKW
[1:51:50] MaDJaM13: I did that and cleared ShB Savage easy.
[1:52:00] wynterdream: The raid lead himself was like OMEGALUL
[1:52:10] MaDJaM13: @Arthars You are right again!
[1:52:39] MaDJaM13: And again, with competent raiders.
[1:52:41] RasnerG: man my group was doing 2 hours a day 5 days a week xD
[1:52:59] lawlietLinucs: and I hate to say that if we do raid like ultimate or savage, labelling static as casual is literally dogshit imo
[1:53:33] MaDJaM13: 2 hours to warm-up/adjust, 1 hour to clear/prog

[3:19:04] Ultimatewar96: @Arthars who is the designer of TOP do you think
[3:19:10] nylosdarkstar: I would argue that outside of a few fights that you already listed, weak auras are entirely unnecessary to compete in WoW on a high level unless you literally just don't have eyeballs
[3:19:51] Ultimatewar96: @nylosdarkstar problem is, who wants the inconvinience of that shit when there's a tool that makes it easier?
[3:21:02] Luminaire69: @nylosdarkstar it gives u an advantage and if everyone else is using it and u refuse to use it, u are griefing ur team
[3:22:08] Classic_Oak: TOP was the guy who made p4s
[3:22:24] Classic_Oak: but i cant remember the name
[3:22:45] wynterdream: @Luminaire69 Ok i don't exactly know how WAs work, but if you execute mechs properly despite not having it, then you shouldn't be griefing?
[3:23:03] wynterdream: WA is the arnie talking one, right?
