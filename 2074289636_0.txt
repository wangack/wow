[0:15:52] Vunoka: True
[0:15:59] Vunoka: Tell Blizzard dude
[0:16:00] Vunoka: Do it
[0:16:00] nightmoonx11: @Whaazz Do you think Shuffle hurts egos of a lot of top players?
[0:16:12] Vunoka: They are 50 year old boomers, they cant think of those ideas
[0:16:18] Vunoka: Tell them on twitter
[0:17:03] Vunoka: Fair enough
[0:17:11] Vunoka: I like the idea
[0:17:18] Fredschen: i bet they could do a special AWC Mount in shop and the revenue alone could pay a lan.
[0:17:36] ilikesheepsx: they scammed tho
[0:17:39] lagunax: hello whazz how often do you use thunderclap in arena ?
[0:17:48] Vunoka: KEKW
[0:18:09] Vunoka: Blizzard is so fucking bad at capitalizing on the fact they got the best pvp game in the world but are shit at marketing
[0:18:21] faytalhahaha: @vunoka real
[0:18:42] retail89: Are you gonna gear feral?
[0:18:47] KingMusicalMel: When Savix hosted that legion 1v1 tourney, it had more viewers than the AWC finals. Shows  there is demand to see known faces compete
[0:19:29] lagunax: hello whazz how often do you use thunderclap in arena ?
[0:19:35] Vunoka: If I was a billionaire I would buy the arena aspect of wow and make it into the thing it has the potential to be
[0:19:59] Vunoka: Sadly I own 21 dollars and some pocket lint

[0:23:02] djdeath1213: wow pros also gotta understand that this is not a social project tho. Sounds like some people expect to be able to play wow for a living just because they invest enough time. Sadly the truth is just that wow pvp tournaments doesnt bring in enough income for them to finance big prize pools
[0:23:32] magnusz: @djdeath1213 u show up without ur face paint again?
[0:23:50] Bronzeflight: hey @whaazz what’s the melee class atm in your opinion

[4:06:02] chromaxen: Westcoast is feed
[4:06:13] FoxiekittenWoW: Guys alot of people seem to not understand that the tournament is also played on EU. The real advantage is the seed you got going into the tournament. Not the servers itself
[4:06:19] kulyowow: idk why u play on west and not on east
[4:06:20] Shynitv: Why dont they just host on east coast?
