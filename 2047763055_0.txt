[1:52:59] luzid7: THE WHOLE SERVER IS YELLING PHASE 2 HYPE XD
[1:53:00] helloiamlucas: gdkp is a system - everyone gets gold at the end

[1:53:01] Dreako00: Guess you're going to have to fuck around and find out
[1:53:02] Candidlol: the distinction will be the pooling and then redistribution of gold
[1:53:02] vluggejaapie89: where can i find the video?
[1:53:06] Lunights: the priest could've never sold it to you. it was his choice, big difference
[1:53:06] Angeroth: I mean they can trade AFTER the raid
[1:53:09] reklebin: hopefully its bop not boe
[1:53:09] CygnusC: the priest could have kept the staff, in a GDKP he would have had to pay for it
[1:53:09] Metaphix: monkaHmm
[1:53:11] staymoonkinJR: @StaysafeTV i have a message from the GDKP Mafia. You are a wanted man. 100g for every one of your deaths. Good like, kid. 󠀀
[1:53:11] SpikeMisery: They'll probably enforce it a week or two max then go back to jacking off like they do with bots.
[1:53:15] Dawgnito: Theyre gonna do bids in discord
[1:53:15] CannonM2K: MindManners MindManners MindManners
[1:53:21] markja629: people will find a loophole
[1:53:27] Derezzed01: the problem isn't GDKP's it's botters and malicious accounts
[1:53:29] MrPink604: That probably fine
[1:53:31] AlphaSimply: no idea
[1:53:33] Prdek2: Priest had chance to say no and you couldnt do anything about it, gdkp is gold rules all opinions
[1:53:33] reklebin: make it all bop
[1:53:34] PugzWoW: @Derezzed01 this
[1:53:37] Metaphix: maybe BoP ye
[1:53:40] tecncaldificltes: what about selling item drops for gold ? like leggings of the fang
[1:53:41] JustaJhin1: @StaysafeTV Whats with the bait title did they ban GDKPs?
[1:53:42] AlphaSimply: prolly just gonna go with reports
[1:53:42] mrrobot616: dungeon gold trade ban / locks on items traded until item can’t be traded any longer. 2hr
[1:53:44] rdy2wrk: They should prob just not allow that either
[1:53:46] Mightyhal: bid for reserves
[1:53:47] Joewrx: im guessing they are only going to enforce advertising them
[1:53:50] nearoz123: get rid of the addons they use for starters
[1:53:50] snake_like: I think that everyone just whispers Phil Spencer personally and he acts as the Arbiter of the GDKP Loot Council. Every time loot is distributed by another other means than MS>OS
[1:53:52] markja629: LFM Gnomer “open loot”
[1:53:55] Wingsofjanitor: they'll have to come up with dog whistles
[1:53:58] dildyj: bnet wide cannot trade  gold with people that were in your group for 2hours /played @StaysafeTV

[1:54:16] handovdoom666: there’s no CS support anyway they all just got canned
[1:54:20] Av3nturA: gold exchangeing hands = gdkp = u need to get gold from china for the bfd run to buy items from ppl
[1:54:22] Derezzed01: again the GDKP's isn't the issue they're targeting, it's botters and malicious accounts taking advantage of it
[1:54:23] reklebin: they should put a thing in saying that its final pay attention and make it bop
[1:54:24] PugzWoW: @syana24 then you fuck over speed runs
[1:54:26] s0rrybr0ther: Imagin if they dont ban people that ninja all the money in the Gdkp
[1:54:29] rdy2wrk: Accidents happen but it's not ticket worthy
[1:54:32] CasualCooky: No gold trading for 2 hours after being in a raid instance SeemsGood

[1:54:48] syana24: @PugzWoW it's all relative if it's uniform

[1:54:50] SpikeMisery: Yeah thats a good idea. Get rid of the 2 hour timer.
[1:54:53] dildyj: PERSONAL LOOT!!!
[1:54:56] fleesyo: they might do it outside of the game for real $$
[1:54:56] kyidentity: SDKP

[1:55:00] Angeroth: paypal discord runs Kappa

[1:56:02] Legallyunaware: glsplitting that up after the run
[1:56:04] softresgodx: it ultimately comes down to them detecting things in game, and let's be honest, if they could do that, gold buying wouldn't be a thing.
[1:56:05] PugzWoW: people won't play "paypal runs" because there's not enough demand for that - most of the GDKPs are not buying gold contrary to what everyone here thinks
[1:56:05] MrPink604: But they'll get banned for that
[1:56:05] Angeroth: Discord AUCTION can u image LUL

[2:35:20] abdarahyin: @deathnntaxes That's shit logic... In Minecraft you CAN technically buy anything you want offline, and they won't ban you... but there's 0% incentive to BUY anything. Blizzard is killing the incentive so they don't need to worry about bots/gold selling in the first place.

[3:35:44] AlphaSimply: he was just doing alot of them pepeLaugh

[3:36:00] ragnof_: viewer here, hate watching gdkp
[3:36:00] fleesyo: 90% of jokerd's stream content
[3:36:01] Arcsilin: they wanna see ppl gamble
[3:36:05] griffi39: @meatseekor i mean he said its not worth to do it, that he gets more gold by farming with mage
[3:36:14] eshonxv: no denying its more interesting to watch than some shitty soft res run
[3:36:32] NutterCircus: You notice they didnt say they would be banning boosting???? PauseChamp
[3:36:32] abruptdecayO_O: gdkp is so weird because what the fuck do you spend the gold on if not selling it
[3:36:38] abruptdecayO_O: in sod that is
[3:36:48] coconutenjoyer: i hate to watch it, because the bidding takes so long is just boring for me
[3:36:52] jrdman: how do you hate gdkps when you bought your epic staff
[3:36:53] Voidbonx: catJAM
[3:37:05] abdarahyin: @paprikafreaka Normally you're not supposed to buy gold, so the average player and gold in the game's economy shouldn't be high anyways.
[3:37:06] griffi39: @paprikafreaka I guess boosting
[3:37:11] ragnof_: @coconutenjoyer foreal they spend 30min sw gates bidding so lame
[3:37:36] coconutenjoyer: @ragnalf_x true
[3:37:55] Guineasaur: I ran them when i needed only 2 pieces. If i dont get what i need i get gold.
[3:38:02] Vicente_Prime: good morning my liege
[3:38:02] NutterCircus: You can pay players to give you the item.
[3:38:07] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV whats to stop RL from just taking all the loot and selling it off at the end of the run?
[3:38:07] MrHuntMeDown: too much gold in the game i
[3:38:16] griffi39: Gold has barely any value cause of the bots
[3:38:22] therealrickdiculous: GDKP is the best way to run pugs its DKP that is universal
[3:38:38] rbo2992: drugs are bad mmmkay
[3:38:50] marceltheold: Its how it affects everyone else. GDKPs and RMT are very similar to why drug laws exist.

[3:39:14] iMattbat: we live in a society
[3:39:16] MrHuntMeDown: yup, its just the best way to keep up and make gold
[3:39:19] Arcsilin: they work in theory, just incentivises RMT
[3:39:23] voreal22: also the guy that won the staff could have said no thanks
[3:39:27] marceltheold: Someone wants to kill themselves with drugs? Fine but they destroy everything around them and make their problem your problem
[3:39:28] Arcsilin: which isnt good
[3:39:30] abdarahyin: ngl I quit WoW because I realized how many people were buying gold and running only GDKPs. I might come back if pugs won't be GDKPs anymore. <3
[3:39:38] linkitcraig: anyone know how gold prices were hit with announcement? idk how much it was before
[3:39:43] abruptdecayO_O: some things are bad in society yet you live in society, interesting
[3:39:47] MrHuntMeDown: GDKP's are fine if you can't buy gold
[3:39:56] Kattaaah: BillyApprove
[3:40:00] rbo2992: huh
[3:40:11] Cenarios13: tax meta sucks Sadge
[3:40:11] AlphaSimply: @linkitcraig its gonna go up, bc of supply and demand, not as many buying etc
[3:40:13] ragnof_: @MrHuntMeDown agreed but when untradable items become buyable it promotes gold buying way more
[3:40:17] NutterCircus: or work the system.
[3:40:29] chiief: hey it's the meme
[3:40:35] MrHuntMeDown: yup. I think the real issue is all the gold injected in the game devalues farming.
[3:40:37] whirlwind_2508: tho you are not forced to do gdkps. taxes, kind of are needed to be paid
[3:40:37] Kattaaah: forsenPls
[3:40:37] Nergala: but is gdkp's the society?
[3:41:03] Cenarios13: we live in a gdkp

[3:41:20] Vicente_Prime: they did?
[3:41:22] Vicente_Prime: WHERE IS IT
[3:41:25] Bobby_NPM: what if bizz implamented dkp into the game, where you could usre your points in pugs

[3:41:43] MrHuntMeDown: isn't it already doomed tho with all the gold aready in the game?
[3:41:52] MayorCraplegs: how are they shutting down GDKPs?
[3:41:54] sigmatw: Won't this encourage more HRs in a way due to player greed in a way?
[3:41:58] SavageLoaf: holy crap didnt knew that - i litteraly unsubscribed to classic wow. Might resubscribe if i see Phase 2 start and it is good.
[3:41:59] rbo2992: WTF
[3:41:59] AlphaSimply: BASED
[3:42:03] AlphaSimply: time is money
[3:42:09] abruptdecayO_O: i mean in wrath it was kind of the only option without a solid guild
[3:42:09] NutterCircus: BOTS
[3:42:23] abruptdecayO_O: there were zero good pugs in wrath that were not gdkp
[3:42:28] NotTheWheel: yeah people look at the rampant bots so they are disillusioned
[3:42:29] andyjamesgames: does buying gold with a Game Token count? Kappa
[3:42:40] stickiriikii: 14 day suspension
[3:42:43] stickiriikii: for buying gold
[3:42:46] WubstepTTV: most people just get suspended had a buddy get 2 weeks for buying 40k on wotlk
[3:42:49] yngvez: They haven't failed to shut down gold buying, they're operating perfectly within what's economically good for the company
[3:42:54] MrHuntMeDown: if you banned 100% of bots right now there is still the issue of all the gold thats left in the game..
[3:42:54] xrazzaks: do you honestly report any gold buyer you know of? @StaysafeTV
[3:42:55] grizz430: according to reddit, the GDKP discord are already coming up with alternatives to get around the ban
[3:43:03] Xammy0: catJAM
[3:43:10] NotTheWheel: catJAM
[3:43:12] NutterCircus: I love how they made it sound like tracking down bots was hard.
[3:43:23] originmorii: this song sounds epic!
[3:43:23] tylerificus: actually miss running around farming rich thorium and black lotus
[3:43:25] NotTheWheel: sstvWAT
[3:43:25] onlyhc2541: i buyed gold, never been banned before, instant 14d ban with the note next time its over :D few months later wow token in wotlk kekw
[3:43:28] xrazzaks: like if a person is in your guild  and you know they buying gold, whats your take
[3:43:28] AlphaSimply: ive got so many bots banned, thats relaly all you should report
[3:43:32] meatseekor: what about youknow who
[3:43:40] marceltheold: I quit my guild for ir but didnt report them
[3:43:46] linkitcraig: the people buying shit for 500k+ gold are probably gold buyers
[3:43:58] ragnof_: what could they do to prevent irl trading tho realistically
[3:44:17] grizz430: why not just report and let Blizzard verify it or not
[3:44:17] MrHuntMeDown: @linkitcraig no way it legit gets that high in gdkps in sod
[3:44:26] NotTheWheel: It drops today
[3:44:27] Arcsilin: ive seen it 1 time
[3:44:27] NotTheWheel: :0
[3:44:33] AlphaSimply: ive seen it multiple times, and have it, never seen the staff drop not even once
[3:44:33] andyjamesgames: @grizz430 ofcourse, because some people  read about the GDKP ban and said "okay, blizzard. hold my beer. challenge accepted"
[3:44:34] h2h_nillz: Dropped for me today
[3:44:36] originmorii: i have it on my lock GIGACHAD
[3:44:47] torecktv: it dropped back to back for us last week lol
[3:44:52] NutterCircus: They wondering why you are not bidding. KEKL
[3:45:07] gatorwow: Does the GDKP ban include all types of gold buying loot in raids?
[3:45:08] WubstepTTV: there isnt
[3:45:12] linkitcraig: @MrHuntMeDown i was mostly talking about wrath
[3:45:15] MrHuntMeDown: how could you tell other than them directly telling you?
[3:45:16] h0t_sauce7: gold buying is handled behind the scenes.
[3:45:32] AlphaSimply: yeah they just catch you anyway, its programmed to flag it when you trade big amounts
[3:45:33] MrHuntMeDown: and with that how would blizzard verify that..
[3:46:01] johncrouton44: blizzard has to do it then right
[3:46:09] gatorwow: That's because people used it to mass report and get people banned in the AQ40 race, they never changed it back
[3:46:13] yngvez: They clearly don't want to ban bots, they want bots to be profitable enough for the botters to make new accounts when they get banned
[3:46:41] johncrouton44: thats dumb
[3:46:51] ragnof_: mages never do this fight right, ive gotten 99 on this boss like 4 times
[3:47:00] ragnof_: you just save evoc and aoe until jorgus comes out lol
[3:47:06] eshonxv: ppl abused it with discord witch hunts, and would just mass report EVERYONE inside an instance, all mages in mara, all paladins in strat etc
[3:47:16] MrHuntMeDown: you don't think blizzard has ever made a way to auto detect bots?
[3:47:29] TheEndIsNear777: bots pay subs
[3:47:33] TheEndIsNear777: Blizz don't want to ban bots
[3:47:36] TheEndIsNear777: :p
[3:47:37] MrHuntMeDown: ^^
[3:47:42] johncrouton44: rip
[3:47:50] plae007: Strategic ban waves after the masses sub prove that ^
[3:47:52] caveman_ju: thank god, this was highly abusable
[3:47:56] bots_bots: @TheEndIsNear777 they often dont pay as much as we do, its not financially beneficial
[3:48:06] marceltheold: I have until HC
[3:48:09] xrazzaks: more than enough
[3:48:10] yngvez: Not enough
[3:48:15] SuperZNova: Me:)
[3:48:22] marceltheold: I specificly didnt play Wrath and TBC because of it
[3:48:25] TheEndIsNear777: @bots_bots :O
[3:48:33] TheEndIsNear777: bot army lol
[3:48:39] NutterCircus: Bots gathering is what gets me.
[3:48:41] Wazirend: Theres even that video explaining that bots buy monthly sub for like 4 euro so no they dont make that much from bots
[3:48:43] ragnof_: and those are the people we need to go play palworld or runescape or gta online lol
[3:48:44] h0t_sauce7: Throne and Liberty turned me off cuz of botting
[3:48:47] Electroblazer: I remember the time I saw like 100 bots at once in westfall
[3:48:49] johncrouton44: thats unfortunate :(
[3:48:50] itbeHootie: i have that opinion but i still play :)
[3:48:53] windatar: Bots buy subs from places like Argentina for 1-3$ a month. So 1 bot = 1 sub isn't correct. Lol
[3:49:03] haunting_haunter: how do you think they are gonna enforce it?
[3:49:06] SuperZNova: For me the cost of legendaries in shadowlands made it clear it aint playable anymore
[3:49:07] Maitel: wait, how did they shut down gdlps?
[3:49:11] MrHuntMeDown: theres nothing else to spend gold on besides gdkps at this point
[3:49:16] MrHuntMeDown: its a major positive imo
[3:49:18] bots_bots: staysafe can we talk about new stv event
[3:49:18] TheEndIsNear777: i wanted to quit wow when they raised Ukraine prices by 20% while they are under war
[3:49:22] mith124: @staysafetv do you think they’ll ban boosting?
[3:49:31] coiozzz: I quit TBC because of bots
[3:49:31] cosmicoriginz: I bet your video led to GDKPs getting banned it was so good
[3:49:44] AlphaSimply: nah thats just apart of the game
[3:49:45] linkitcraig: i was very burned out of the game but this GDKP name has given me hope
[3:49:48] AlphaSimply: its been around for ages
[3:50:04] windatar: Also anyone else think its funny, Now that Ybarra got canned who supported GDKP/Boosting and the moment hes gone they crack down?
[3:50:08] speedzombie: Anti boosting would be great
[3:50:14] AlphaSimply: they could lower xp for higher level players boosting lower etc
[3:50:39] grizz430: but the new mage healing makes safespotting pretty much obsolete
[3:50:42] cosmicoriginz: Can't get XP outside of stone levels, massive nerfs if someone is higher level than you, teleports mobs to you if kite too long, mobs run faster if you kite, mobs become immune to CC and snares
[3:50:44] linkitcraig: they made mobs become immune to roots and shit right?
[3:50:44] VeZzE666: @speedzombie No it wouldnt that is what killed previous classic iterations. Game is not fun when ppl dont play it
[3:50:56] fuzeb0x_: they changed mob pathing and made the mobs run really fast and immune CC after so long in combat if i remember correctly
[3:50:56] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[3:50:57] RagnarVolarus80: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[3:51:12] sadalxx: they became immune to all forms of CC after being in combat for 30 seconds
[3:51:30] avox_o7: at the end of TBC, they made mobs that were grey to you stun you after X amount of time
[3:51:31] MeisteryZH: LFM herb DKP starting bid 20 swiftthistle
[3:51:31] MrHuntMeDown: no wipe
[3:51:33] avox_o7: unavoidable stun
[3:51:36] zVYSEz: in sod they just nerfed the fuck out of xp if someone was higher level
[3:51:40] ticeyx: those anti boost things are TERRIBLE, they summon you and shit, you cant meme and run around anymore
[3:51:41] zVYSEz: i mean som
[3:51:44] Indomitablez: I ran 4 BFD today. Staff dropped twice (once on rogue, once on my pally) and 2h sword just dropped on my hunter
[3:51:45] mith124: I wonder - does trap launching kill the need to melee weave?
[3:51:50] NotDessx: New mage runes don't care about that @staysafetv
[3:51:54] Qworalmarker: They also put invisible walls at reset spots
[3:51:56] AlphaSimply: @Indomitablez liar
[3:51:58] MrHuntMeDown: @zVYSEz think that was tbc
[3:52:03] windatar: Matchmaking BABY LETSGO
[3:52:08] cosmicoriginz: Priest pain suppression is going to make shadow priest unkillable
[3:52:14] mith124: dude balance getting eclipse is hype
[3:52:22] originmorii: adding the trap launcher during prime stv time, dear fuckin lord

[4:31:30] Vicente_Prime: WOAH
[4:31:33] windatar: With Ybarra gone, GDKPers/Boosters lost their biggest defender. Which is probably why the change happened.

[4:32:04] wagyu_88: You think they will make bfd 1d lockout for the last week?

[4:34:41] NutterCircus: Just farm the same Raid for XP that we been Raiding for last 2 months...
[4:34:41] kzixxgaming: They said it would give xp to "mid to late 30s"
[4:34:50] membaberrytv: my route:  First login levelling route is looking optimal to do this: Have your character logged outside of BFD (run it for the lockout) Turn in pre-quests: Zoram > Splinter > Stonetalon > Camp T >  TB (train skills) > Thousand needles > straight to RFK spam
[4:35:06] Contmotore: Where's your mount
[4:35:08] Aquatak: last boss would also kinda prevent mage boosting
[4:35:17] windatar: Hand in all your quests Dungeon run to 30 do BFD at 31 for regular people by the time they hit 37 the 3 day will lapse and you do it again for 38 then dungeon run for 2 levels easy.
[4:35:18] kzixxgaming: @StaysafeTV They said it would give xp to "mid to late 30s"
[4:35:21] Aquatak: cause of the locked door

[4:54:08] Hielloz: if blizz wants to get rid of gdkp why didn't they just implement personal loot?
[4:54:09] Skerpi: its just the setup to have the token get into SOD, thats all
[4:54:10] chatgpttwitchbot: what do u mean CLASSIC GDKP's DELETED ?
[4:54:10] windatar: @Denz0TV Everyone knows that, but what it does do is force it out of the general public, GDKP's will now have to screen people because all it takes is one SS from one snitch to ban 9 people.

[4:55:43] Jorbadd: Did blizz make a statement on gdkps?
[4:55:48] windatar: I mean, if they cut out gold from it means bots no longer sell gold for it.
[4:55:49] MayorCraplegs: What are they doing to ban it exactly?
[4:55:50] windatar: Lol
[4:55:50] craboskai: plus it gives them the right to just perma ban anyone that gets caught in a gdkp KEKL
[4:55:51] NutterCircus: If it makes GDKP inconveinient, we still won.

[5:00:44] abruptdecayO_O: ROOOOIGHT no hc rmt roooooight
[5:00:49] yuckil: what
[5:00:49] chatgpttwitchbot: can anyone link me the gdkp ban post i dont see it
[5:00:50] MayorCraplegs: Can you explain how they enforce the ban of GDKPs? I just dont see how they can do it since they arent even capable of banning the gold farming bots and fly hacks
[5:00:51] OptimusBanana420: no way!?!?
[5:00:51] yuckil: ??????
[5:00:54] aoe_enjoyer: teeny violin KEKW
[5:00:55] reeesheep123: might just resub if that's true. ruining the game economy for honest players just because they're desperate for pixels
[5:01:02] aoe_enjoyer: judgement day
[5:01:02] Hielloz: surprised pikachu face
[5:01:03] zUg_zUg_: what would u spend on
[5:01:06] abruptdecayO_O: consumes
[5:01:11] ProSounds: the real shitty thing is if there was ZERO gold buying, an occasional gdkp raid would be pretty cool honestly. but with gold buying they're locusts instead of a cool occasional way to raid
[5:01:11] Mertauh: no one ever turned off the addon to avoid deaths either
[5:01:17] ardice1: consumes
[5:01:18] Wrettchh: they wouldn't!!!!!!!
[5:01:20] Mertauh: or adjusted the files
[5:01:40] zUg_zUg_: makes sense
[5:01:50] Qslank: 2019 classic era was a golden age for us if we think about it. back then gdkps were a vvery nice thing it had its small place but now it became way to rampant i feel
[5:02:06] craboskai: just like bagjones KEKW
[5:02:21] NutterCircus: Just turn it off for a sec... KEKL
[5:02:27] Hielloz: HC SSF players that make it to max level = GIGACHAD

[5:06:45] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV why don't you just hit record in OBS when you start reacting and stop when you finish so you don't need to even cut it down
[5:06:51] re5onxnce: looks clearer
[5:06:53] squirtlesquirt: not staysafe
[5:07:05] squirtlesquirt: gdkps are trash for the game
[5:07:37] gokuthebeginner: @squirtlesquirt just cause of rmt
[5:07:46] Probulator: I wonder how they are gonna enforce it, it seems like its going to be based on reporting players
[5:07:55] squirtlesquirt: watching your recent video staysafe and seeing this post

[5:08:07] MayorCraplegs: so its not gonna be very good?
[5:08:08] ardice1: well not everyone who does gdkps buys gold..... 90% do but not everyone
[5:08:19] Mertauh: they enforce it by not enforcing it like everything else BASED but the message helps
[5:08:22] NutterCircus: I dont know what addon I have that does the dmf buff automatically...
[5:08:29] squirtlesquirt: they do buy gold
[5:08:29] Hazeium: @StaysafeTV Are we mass reporting Ahmpy?
[5:08:36] squirtlesquirt: I bought gold to do gdkps
[5:08:41] gokuthebeginner: @ardice1 everybody is there to leech gold from goldbuyers YEP
[5:08:49] Probulator: I see a lot of mass reporting trolls in the near future
[5:08:54] windatar: Ahmpy is a good guy, he'll just change up what he does.

[5:09:25] windatar: @gressil1234 Only if you talk to them/ message them or mess with them. If you select them and report they don't.
[5:09:30] NutterCircus: Fuggin liberals want people that GDKP to lose their jobs and shit. These freakin liberals....
[5:09:30] OptimusBanana420: uh oh class
[5:09:32] squirtlesquirt: NO MORE GDKPS IN WOW LOL

[5:09:46] squirtlesquirt: finally
[5:09:56] WaffletheMan101: fair
[5:10:01] mundanesickle: false
[5:10:07] Denz0TV: People celebrating, but Blizzard hasn't solved the root cause of the issue which is botting and gold selling
[5:10:14] Mertauh: report everyone I don't like pepoG
[5:10:17] Aquatak: what about the time where they still were uninformed
[5:10:22] NutterCircus: I can see this shit going south for StaySafe...
[5:10:23] mundanesickle: objectively true but not subjectively
[5:10:24] Denz0TV: Bandaid for the bigger issue at hand
[5:10:33] squirtlesquirt: it’s like when they banned multi boxers
[5:10:38] squirtlesquirt: easy to enforce
[5:10:44] woodland1: !video
[5:10:44] Nightbot: GIANT SOD NEWS / DISCUSSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:10:45] WaffletheMan101: @denz0tv the main motivator for the botting and gold selling WAS GDKPs
[5:10:47] Denz0TV: People bought gold back in 2005 without GDKPs
[5:10:48] squirtlesquirt: and got rid of all the multi boxed streamers
[5:10:49] ardice1: no
[5:10:53] Mertauh: GDKPs encourage botting and gold buying, what the fuck else do you spend money on in this game OMEGALUL
[5:10:54] Frank4LuLz: NO TIME TO FARM
[5:10:56] squirtlesquirt: I buy gold for gdkps
[5:10:58] Hazeium: @StaysafeTV Yes and GDKP leaders sell gold, it's a story as old as time
[5:11:00] windatar: Staysafe, do you think with GDKP being banned on SoD do you think Botters will move to a different wow client where GDKP's are allowed for a bigger buyer market? GDKP's are only banned in SoD.
[5:11:05] Butterywheel: the game is only to be enjoyed by the permamiters stay safe sees fit.
[5:11:08] deathnntaxes: people buying gold way before gdkps were out
[5:11:11] ardice1: yeah and youre the problem @squirtlesquirt
[5:11:12] WaffletheMan101: @denz0tv people were bad at the game in 2005
[5:11:13] OGSceneBoy: @Mertauh So damn true
[5:11:28] xyth_alispera: 200g for staff in some GDKPs how else are people affording these fucking items…
[5:11:29] squirtlesquirt: I buy gold to do gdkps because gdkps is the mega
[5:11:31] deathnntaxes: GDKP isnt the problem, and should 100% be allowed as long as gold is farmed the fair way
[5:11:32] Denz0TV: You think people won't buy gold to get BIS boes off AH? To buy boosts? To buy summons?
[5:11:34] squirtlesquirt: meta
[5:11:38] squirtlesquirt: not no more tho
[5:11:39] pengwin06: the question is, can blizzard even get rid of all gdkps? if they can’t, some players will have a huge parsing advantage over the rest
[5:11:41] squirtlesquirt: LOL
[5:11:44] yuckil: more circlesssss
[5:11:56] cosmicoriginz: Pog
[5:12:02] OptimusBanana420: flash bang
[5:12:13] yuckil: my soul
[5:12:20] cjadude: thisguy really was a teacher sstvWAT
[5:12:28] Goldbowser: there will be a black market for gdkp 100%
[5:12:41] Goldbowser: maybe they will do flask runs instead or some trade item instead of gold
[5:12:41] karsy239: hot take but the gold sellers are due to blizzard giving cheaper subscriptions rates for countries with weak currency, think most of South America. Wouldn’t be as profitable with a true $15 subscription
[5:12:41] imdeazyz: you drawing me rn
[5:12:41] Seoken1: in private polls, gold buyers make up 30-70% of the playerbase btw (bought gold past year vs past 5 years)
[5:12:42] NutterCircus: Our propaganda campaign is almost complete.

[5:13:41] WaffletheMan101: 50% or higher
[5:13:43] justharri93: 95%
[5:13:44] re5onxnce: at least half
[5:13:50] xyth_alispera: 95% the other 5 are pvp sweats
[5:13:50] MechanizedTV: very small
[5:13:52] Ramral91: what else are they spending it on?
[5:13:52] memil141: more rhen 50
[5:13:56] Seoken1: In phase 2 there would be mounts, which would change it a TON. But Pre phase 2 its more GDKP oriented for sure
[5:13:56] Buttsworth: what else do you buy gold with?
[5:13:57] Doomgu: what else do you even need gold for
[5:14:00] Shredmuffn: gdkp was the best gold farm KEKW didnt have to buy anything if you carry
[5:14:02] souljazz: plenty of reasons to buy gold without GDKPs
[5:14:04] NutterCircus: We gotta a real gold buying problem.
[5:14:07] OGSceneBoy: Way more then 50% lol
[5:14:07] jvpjoe: ive brought gold 10 times ive never gone too a gdkp ever
[5:14:15] Buttsworth: @Doomgu ayyyy
[5:14:18] WaffletheMan101: @seoken1 mounts are half price now
[5:14:18] MechanizedTV: Most ppl buy less than 100g and dont gdkp
[5:14:22] Mertauh: pepeMeltdown
[5:14:23] Aquatak: reported @jvpjoe
[5:14:26] gnomezayin1: There would be a major chunk towards spending gold on boosts too (as if getting to 25 was hard)
[5:14:27] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV This is going to have a huge effect on botting too. The big time botters are doing it because it's profitable. With GDKPs gone there is going to be a WAY lower demand, which means demand is way down. Even if supply stays the same, the price will fall, hopefully to a point it's not profitable for botters anymore
[5:14:28] WaRsoN67: ooo NFT time
[5:14:34] woods6868: i spend 80g in a gdkp
[5:14:37] Seoken1: @WaffletheMan101 oh I know, Im saying currently most gold buyers are probably using it for gdkp, in the future, other stuff will cost gold
[5:14:44] yuckil: who here bought gold and got banned
[5:14:50] dipchit1: @MechanizedTTV are we doing it on a percentage of people, or percentage of # gold bought?
[5:14:52] yuckil: Kappa
[5:14:53] Diamsofer: pepeCD
[5:15:08] NutterCircus: Math isnt important Jebaited
[5:15:12] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:15:29] Aquatak: I only ever joined gdkps when I geared up to boost/leech
[5:15:32] butterzugzug: @gnomezayin1 it's not about difficulty. it's about lazyness and jump into the endgame of the phase
[5:15:35] Seoken1: Math checks out
[5:16:04] flawless_jv: how is blizzard stopping gdkps? sorry just got here so im clueless
[5:16:16] OGSceneBoy: Way more then cutting half dude
[5:16:21] zUg_zUg_: other 50 is death rolls
[5:16:24] pursuitjr: They just made gold cheaper to buy, price will go down lol
[5:16:27] gnomezayin1: @butterzugzug I got boosts in classic to get from like 40-60. So i agree. My point was that people buy and spend gold for that...
[5:16:37] NutterCircus: But what about the lowly Gold Farmers StaySafe?
[5:16:42] Wadjaah: it is a great thing
[5:16:42] DaddySmelly: Yep
[5:16:46] Seoken1: If GDKP's want to be smart, they will just convert to non gold currency lol. That wouldn't break the rules, but would be the same result @StaysafeTV
[5:16:47] Mertauh: Easiest way to say it is this. In classic WoW you only need to spend money on consumes, BoE/profession gear, and boosts/gdkps. GDKPs make up the vast majority of demand for gold buying dwarfing everything else
[5:16:49] mundanesickle: deathroll addicts lol
[5:16:49] Denz0TV: Until people sell ticketed runs which aren't GDKPs
[5:16:51] Aquatak: tbh I don’t mind ppl buying gold for mounts or consumes as much as for gear that affects pvp
[5:16:52] dipchit1: how could you stop gdkps, they just arrange them on discord then
[5:16:58] Probulator: theres gonna be discord speakeasies still doing GDKPs advertising it under a new code name in lfg and bidding will be done there and not in raid chat
[5:16:58] xyth_alispera: for all those sad about gdkps being banned you always have retail where blizzard had utterly given up and surprise surprise it’s still allowed there
[5:16:59] zUg_zUg_: HUGE
[5:17:32] NutterCircus: Zelle me $5 bucks for that loots yo.
[5:17:33] charli_pepper: it only takes 1 person to report them to get 40 people banned tho. risky
[5:17:35] realandtruephobe: How long until your full react video is up?
[5:17:36] pandreas: if they do this for Cata, it will be even more dead @StaysafeTV
[5:17:37] MayorCraplegs: I feel like GDKPs is a non issue if they just actually ban the gold farming and selling accounts and the gold buyers
[5:17:39] WaffletheMan101: @staysafetv what do you think the penalty should be for GDKPs?
[5:17:40] OGSceneBoy: W take dude
[5:17:42] Probulator: it will still make it harder instead of mainstreamin it
[5:17:44] MendozaJr: How have they removed GDKP? Havde I misesed somsething?
[5:17:44] kekwtuna: Any info on premades?
[5:17:45] mundanesickle: is paypal tos?
[5:17:49] DaddySmelly: @karsy239 They dont buy subs, they pay with token by botting 10k in wrath
[5:17:58] Seoken1: oh yeah staysafe its a good change. I didn't even mean paypal, this doesn't ban "item trading raids" though. Think thick leather now, black lotus in the future etc
[5:18:02] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV This is going to have a huge effect on botting too. The big time botters are doing it because it's profitable. With GDKPs gone there is going to be a WAY lower demand, which means demand is way down. Even if supply stays the same, the price will fall, hopefully to a point it's not profitable for botters anymore
[5:18:10] Aquatak: @mayorcraplegs many people buy gold through gdkps when they get “their cut”
[5:18:10] souljazz: it's going to be like hookers trying to advertise lol "money exchanged is for time only"
[5:18:11] windatar: @MendozaJr GDKP will be treated the same way as botting and rmt.
[5:18:13] dipchit1: i just cant imagine they actually do any enforcement at all, like are they gonna have staff reading chat and banning gdkp ads?
[5:18:17] AintFinnaSubscribe: good song
[5:18:20] WaffletheMan101: @mendozajr they are banning it, from our understanding it’s now a bannable offense
[5:18:29] mattbarz989: join a gdkp
[5:18:34] OptimusBanana420: VIBE
[5:18:38] 3kmmr7kskill: !gdkp
[5:18:38] Mertauh: @MendozaJr they banned them as an experiment at the start of phase 2 in SoD specifically. This does not apply to era, hardcore, or wotlk
[5:18:46] Aquatak: many people buy gold through gdkps when they get “their cut” so it also DIRECTLY affects gold buyers safety
[5:18:53] MayorCraplegs: @Aquatak which would be a non issue if they have already put a stop to the buying and selling of gold

[5:19:31] cosmicoriginz: KEKW

[5:19:51] nach7vos: LUL
[5:19:54] Denz0TV: @dipchit1 Because Blizzard are retards and can't do their jobs
[5:19:54] egduj_: i like gdkps because i farm a shit ton of gold, sucks that gold buyers ruin it
[5:19:57] Harles_: ive been hearing ppl say other means of services will go up in price
[5:20:05] ChiliMoMilli: @dipchit1 because bot programs change all the time and botters just fire up hundreds of new accounts when ban waves go out.
[5:20:09] xyth_alispera: Hot topic but every streamer I watch seems to be using the GDKP payment as a guise to their buying of gold
[5:20:10] gnomezayin1: @dipchit1 because they will probably only monitor chat and not actual gameplay
[5:20:13] tsetse2fly: billyReady music
[5:20:17] ChiliMoMilli: @Denz0TV you have 0 fucking idea what you're talking about lol
[5:20:24] xyth_alispera: you will know who is doing it by their reaction to the GDKP change
[5:20:28] dipchit1: they must have a new chat monitoring ai
[5:20:37] windatar: What do you wannah bet they're going to see how bots react as well. They're probably going to see if banning GDKP has an effect on the bot population. After all if your client base is gone on SoD but still there in ERA/Wotlk/Retail then they would go where the money is.
[5:20:42] WaffletheMan101: @dipchit1 it takes more man power to ban bots and both should be banned
[5:20:48] KKonaStevieG: MonkaW
[5:20:49] tsetse2fly: LOCK billyReady
[5:21:07] NutterCircus: LVL 25 buying gold is obnoxious.

[5:21:39] Aquatak: you can also disguise buying gold through “donations”

[5:21:46] Probulator: wonder if they could ban the trading of non consumables and gold to players tied to that raid id for each lockout
[5:21:48] tsetse2fly: @Mertauh only soda got punished, and it was a small punishment
[5:21:59] charli_pepper: GDKPs were a toxic environment and bad for the player. It caused people to buy gold to compete, PERIOD. Made the game way more stressful rather than having a traditional DKP or reserve system
[5:22:16] Aquatak: or maybe 40g from 10 chats
[5:22:22] G4PING: competition makes wow stressful
[5:22:23] xyth_alispera: Yeah where do you think the people giving the streamer the gold got the hundreds of gold to begin with
[5:22:24] Aquatak: chars
[5:22:24] Denz0TV: @ChiliMoMilli Blizzard fan boy? Bet you came your your pants when they banned GDKPs when it won't even solve the problem in the long run
[5:22:28] G4PING: my god what is gaming fucking coming too
[5:22:30] windatar: How hilarious would it be if they put in non tradable personal loot. LOL
[5:22:41] Tesla369: i love the tea
[5:22:44] Mertauh: @tsetse2fly na he talked about it at the time and said it happened to a lot of people in the guild and he was lucky that he didn't get banned, other people at least had their gold removed just not as publicl
[5:22:45] ChiliMoMilli: @AveragePvp I see what you mean LOL
[5:22:52] egduj_: i have 3k gold atm
[5:23:03] Derezzed01: there's nothing wrong with GDKP's at all blame all the bots and RMT traders
[5:23:06] gnomezayin1: @egduj_ share? Lol
[5:23:07] etou1: People can still sell runs tho, even with personal loot Sadge
[5:23:07] Dillsmof: You should try lake of fire today big hog
[5:23:07] NutterCircus: I think its a bit early for Personal loot.
[5:23:09] xyth_alispera: just my take from my many many many hours playing with these guys myself
[5:23:20] egduj_: @gnomezayin1 just make a mage LOL
[5:23:35] tsetse2fly: @Mertauh Who else got their gold removed besides soda?
[5:23:41] windatar: @Derezzed01 GDKP is like the gun to the crime. By itself in the right hands its perfectly fine. But man it makes crime easier to do.
[5:23:42] gnomezayin1: @egduj_ yeah I'm a dummy and she's my 4th too. If I was smart she would have been my first
[5:23:44] dispensaryttv: if you cant beat em milk em
[5:23:46] pengwin06: the thing with the ban is they don’t need to ban everyone. they just need to ban the raid leaders and almost all of gdkps go away.
[5:23:50] cripples42069: no class trainer in xroads?
[5:23:53] gnomezayin1: 4th toon*
[5:24:00] KKonaStevieG: YEP
[5:24:03] egduj_: my mage is my 4th toon also
[5:24:09] Derezzed01: @windatar True but there will always be crime GDKP or not
[5:24:11] Aquatak: ppl really arguing like dealing and consuming drugs isn’t bad just get rid of the drugs 4Head
[5:24:11] Probulator: what if Blizzard is adding a social credit score to SoD
[5:24:12] charli_pepper: I will 100% be snitching on GDKP leaders
[5:24:13] xyth_alispera: Love your content btw man your the voice for a lot of us veteran wow players
[5:24:16] 3kmmr7kskill: blizz should implement monetary policy and jerome powell npc
[5:24:17] Mertauh: @tsetse2fly at least pokelawls and xqc that I know of
[5:24:23] NutterCircus: Its about as bad as joining a Streamer server EleGiggle

[5:24:43] naxxramen: yes in the corssroads
[5:24:44] abruptdecayO_O: ratchet
[5:24:46] windatar: @Derezzed01 Correct, but you still need laws to fight crime. which is what this is.
[5:24:49] naxxramen: ratchet*
[5:24:50] Jacohej: in rachet
[5:24:53] charli_pepper: I'm going to infiltrate the underground GDKP world and snitch on all of em when the change takes effect
[5:25:20] hoffa_fred: hey what would you say are the best warlock runs so far. love your streams
[5:25:32] Brockxs: huh
[5:25:38] NutterCircus: Nothing... Its a show about nothing PauseChamp
[5:25:50] h2h_nillz: PAYO WAS RIGHT!
[5:25:51] itsae__: creative with the names
[5:25:52] Jetmyst: GET THE GLOCK
[5:25:56] Mertauh: How often do they think people look at the user list in a stream? lol
[5:26:01] Buttsworth: WHAT IS UP WITH THESE EGIRL BOTS?!
[5:26:05] Probulator: ai bots
[5:26:10] leech0000: i for one need my nightly rat asmr
[5:26:20] memil141: ahha :D
[5:26:21] Vicente_Prime: KILL THEM
[5:26:25] xyth_alispera: egirl bots better than gold farming bots
[5:26:25] NutterCircus: Prob trying to attract Money Launderers.
[5:26:29] bots_bots: SNIFFA any egirls in chat
[5:26:38] WaffletheMan101: @staysafetv buying viewers Kappa
[5:26:59] KKonaStevieG: Why no echad bots? Kappa
[5:27:01] DKCourtel: is currency even an important part of an mmo?
[5:27:06] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:27:10] leech0000: didnt emily have like 30 subs or something?
[5:27:12] Hazeium: I'm sure there's some lonely sucker getting catfished by these bots
[5:27:14] Aquatak: femchad new meta
[5:27:17] DKCourtel: what if u had wow with no gold copper or silver
[5:27:20] xyth_alispera: Elon musk was right AI is getting out of hand we can’t even play wow in peace without AI
[5:27:43] WaffletheMan101: @dkcourtel then you get something like path of exile where useful items become currency
[5:27:47] NutterCircus: Its kind of tough for an Egirl to get subs just showing a long road.
[5:27:55] xyth_alispera: One thing that sucks about bots is the scripting is so bad like shit at least give me a good fight with all that tech that goes into them
[5:27:56] Probulator: ask chat gpt how to ban GDKPs
[5:28:04] Vicente_Prime: TENGO EL JODIDO DINERO
[5:28:05] Dillsmof: Put shadow burn on your bar
[5:28:07] Vicente_Prime: Y VOY A SACARTE DE AHÍ
[5:28:13] realandtruephobe: What did he say he's missing?
[5:28:16] DKCourtel: @WaffletheMan101 but what if they arnt tradable and only aquried as they are right now through mutual effort
[5:28:25] Vicente_Prime: too much spanish Sadge
[5:28:29] Qiima1: change ring
[5:28:41] harvenius: Are they making everything BoP to kill GDKP?
[5:28:58] funweekenddad: @StaysafeTV Any plans to min max leveling when p2 drops? Like 18 wsg marks, maxed quest log, dungeon spam group prepped, bfd lockouts ready, money for summons, rep gear pre bought, flight paths all found, full shipments stored. Things like that ?
[5:29:05] AveragePvp: lake of fire 🔥 ?
[5:29:18] WaffletheMan101: @dkcourtel that is called solo self found, meaning you can only use items you farmed yourself and that is in PoE and a few other MMOs
[5:29:21] Plopinfresh: no imp talents?
[5:29:38] serralej: Have you tried playing priest, super fun

[5:29:54] AveragePvp: fair enough
[5:29:55] egduj_: should raid as affliction its not bad
[5:29:57] aoe_enjoyer: priest is GIGA
[5:29:59] DKCourtel: @WaffletheMan101 well yeah but the best gear in wow isnt BoE. in many other expansions. people arnt paying for gear that is tradable either
[5:30:06] gnomezayin1: Ahh kk!
[5:30:07] DaddySmelly: Do you think Lake will be better when it can be downranked?
[5:30:11] serralej: Priests are crazy good on SoD, feel invincible
[5:30:24] Arcsilin: thad be retarded
[5:30:25] realandtruephobe: Super way too early p2 best class predictions
[5:30:27] Dillsmof: They gave you 2 mages for scorch stack how nice of them
[5:30:32] Mertauh: people would legit lose their minds
[5:30:32] mundanesickle: priests are only going to be worse next phase
[5:30:36] Smoothiez_: ele and boomy
[5:30:39] WaffletheMan101: I’ve leveled a priest for mind control shenanigans in phase 2 @staysafetv
[5:30:40] abruptdecayO_O: wow players are too dumb to handle pure bop

[5:30:58] kingtoke1991: wait why is GDKP deleted? what did they do? @StaysafeTV
[5:31:07] kingtoke1991: remove the timer?
[5:31:16] kingtoke1991: so good for the game honestly
[5:31:22] kingtoke1991: Agreed? :)
[5:31:26] Probulator: remove master loot lol release the ninjas
[5:31:34] Mertauh: I think the music got stuck a little loud compared to your voice
[5:31:41] re5onxnce: pvp ques
[5:31:47] Vunoka: Wait they removed GDKP?! That is HUGE
[5:31:49] dipchit1: @Probulator hell yeah
[5:31:56] deep_freeze_: is enchanting gonna be BiS for casters?
[5:32:06] TheEyeVII: they banned gdkp? good TwitchConHYPE
[5:32:24] dave3ooo: is it gone tho?
[5:32:34] dave3ooo: how do they enforce this
[5:32:35] TheEyeVII: is it cuz they'll put the wow token in so people can just do boosts instead? I bet that's it!
[5:32:37] Harles_: been hearing ppl say already that other services will go up in gold to compensate, opinion?
[5:32:52] WaffletheMan101: premades are deadish too, that’s huge
[5:32:57] tsetse2fly: @dave3ooo Obvously not 100%, but 99% is better than nothing
[5:33:00] DaddySmelly: @Harles_ What services?
[5:33:05] TheEyeVII: we love the wow token
[5:33:16] Cenarios13: +50% xp for 1-25 so doubt they're doing token/boost
[5:33:21] NutterCircus: At this rate I wonder if p3 will have a new Dungeon.
[5:33:22] RodanQQ: black queen will give use wow token
[5:33:25] Vunoka: wow token and GDKPs
[5:33:27] Vunoka: for me
[5:33:31] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV the wow token was blizzards concession that they couldnt stop RMT
[5:33:32] h2h_nillz: explain the wow token
[5:33:35] leech0000: for me the problem with wotlk was not enough undead
[5:33:35] h2h_nillz: idk what that is
[5:33:56] tsetse2fly: @h2h_nillz legal way to buy gold
[5:34:01] Mertauh: @h2h_nillz buy an item with real life money from the blizzard shop. It can be redeemed for 30 days play time and sold on the AH for gold
[5:34:02] Denz0TV: People quit wrath because they are dogshit at the game. Boomers can't raid heroic difficulty
[5:34:06] Harles_: @DaddySmelly trade kills for stv, prof stuff, quests..
[5:34:22] funweekenddad: i farmed 60g on my hunter, went to the AH and couldnt justify spending the money haha. Not this close to p2
[5:34:28] kingtoke1991: good for blizzard. gdkp literally killed the game honestly
[5:34:47] MC_WhiteNoiz: Remember when there was so many gold farmers it was national news in 2005. And there were no gdkp
[5:35:03] dave3ooo: yeah, classic definitely isn't dead
[5:35:08] raquu: Any word on profession caps?
[5:35:21] garbobean: catJAM
[5:35:26] Arcsilin: its actually hilarious
[5:35:30] bots_bots: @raquu 225
[5:35:31] kingtoke1991: @StaysafeTV Youve watched the youtibe video about what ACTUALLY happens in the background with GDKP right?
[5:35:31] p6dra: How will they police it? Just ban the work GDKP from chat?
[5:35:34] TheEyeVII: people were buying gold vanilla to wod and then people kept buying gold with the token, except money went to the company at least with token @StaysafeTV explain why it's bad
[5:35:36] MC_WhiteNoiz: The botting is the damage
[5:35:37] leech0000: 225 and no specializations
[5:35:40] strafexlive: the people that are mad bought a ton of gold
[5:35:43] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV people are addicted to it. It's a shame
[5:35:48] dave3ooo: yeah, like most gdkp groups have discords
[5:35:50] dave3ooo: so like
[5:36:03] dave3ooo: they can just conduct bids entirely in disc
[5:36:04] DaddySmelly: @Harles_ For profs, the cost will probably naturally go up in cost if there aren't farmers pumping the economy full of botted mats. Win trading in STV will be what it is, there is no baseline to measure against
[5:36:19] leech0000: i have 11g in SoD right now, im pretty mad i wont be able to attend gdkps now
[5:36:21] g0dzilla: hey, whats the "CLASSIC GDKP's DELETED"? is there a source? i missed it i think
[5:36:29] p6dra: @dave3ooo just trust blizz
[5:36:44] g0dzilla: thx though
[5:36:47] dave3ooo: i will never trust blizz lmao
[5:36:54] Harles_: @DaddySmelly yea thats what i was thinking, there was a few other things i just cant remember
[5:37:01] dave3ooo: i just wanna know how they're gonna enforce it
[5:37:14] PriceMaker: How are they gonna be able to cancel GDKPs how will the enforce it?
[5:37:17] MC_WhiteNoiz: Gold buyers are still going to buy the gold. And spend it on the AH
[5:37:20] kingpincognito: Our LK guild was losing raider's lockouts to GDKPs because it was, "a more efficient use of my time"
[5:37:22] MoonZTi: Lets all buy gold rq
[5:37:30] NutterCircus: Asmons bad Take on the GDKP... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evp_UmpTpcM
[5:37:32] serralej: whats so bad about it, why does it have to be gold, im for one im glad gdkps are gone, as long as raids arent 40 ppl large
[5:37:34] hazebase: They also get rid of bots since 20 years.. It's really working out (:
[5:37:39] DaddySmelly: The token is Blizzard conceding they cant stop RMT. It puts a white market monetary value on gold
[5:37:41] MC_WhiteNoiz: Now people who don't buy gold will just be broke. Buyers will have more power than ever.
[5:38:00] kingpincognito: We were clearing content just fine. There just wasn't a payout.
[5:38:13] Bobby_NPM: a gold sink cause the garrison table f'd up the economy
[5:38:16] raquu: regards the last president of blizzard
[5:38:16] Minje12: absolutely
[5:38:16] Brockxs: @MC_WhiteNoiz are you baiting m8?

[5:38:40] dave3ooo: that part
[5:38:40] DaddySmelly: The fact black market gold is cheaper than token indicates blizz has no idea
[5:38:42] bots_bots: they wanted a piece of the pie
[5:38:42] MC_WhiteNoiz: @brockxs I'm saying people are turning on each other rather than focus on the problem
[5:38:43] Kewl__: money always
[5:38:43] kingpincognito: Druid bots everywhere.
[5:38:44] h0t_sauce7: blizzard wanted in on it
[5:38:45] Wadjaah: How dare you say that
[5:38:46] Buttsworth: the reason was blizzard wanted to make money
[5:38:49] butterzugzug: it's a company
[5:38:50] cosmicoriginz: They needed to fund Bobby's golden parachute

[5:39:18] AvroraBg: @butterzugzug stfu
[5:39:21] sigilfish: wow token is net negative to the game YEP
[5:39:28] serralej: SoD is blizzards project to see how people would react if they were given what they want
[5:39:33] TheEyeVII: @StaysafeTV you got any proof on that? rather people buy more or less or if the wow token is their #1 cash instead of store mounts or xpac/sub
[5:39:35] itsae__: @butterzugzug yeaaa stfu

[5:40:00] Saynay: xD
[5:40:01] user11214: LUL
[5:40:04] MC_WhiteNoiz: The inflation is brought on by the bots. Gold is harvested from the server not players. My GDKP group does 5g min bid. We're just dudes playing not whales.
[5:40:19] bots_bots: if you go to the logout spot and die, but dont release, u can still do the logout skip
[5:40:32] MC_WhiteNoiz: We always go home with something whether we get drops or not.
[5:40:51] DaddySmelly: @MC_WhiteNoiz not anymore m8 lol. lmao even

[5:42:36] DaddySmelly: @MC_WhiteNoiz you can get so many respecs next phase! awesome!
[5:42:56] sigilfish: even adding one extra button press cuts buyers in half at least
[5:42:56] Kewl__: token means more gold buying
[5:42:58] Minje12: tbh for me its just not worth to grind my own goal when I have a job, so I just buy tokens when I'm running short. I dont run GDKPs at all tho in neither game
[5:43:12] Minje12: gold*
[5:43:29] Buttsworth: GIVE ME SOME OF THAT CRANBERRY

[5:44:05] VesanTV: @hntb100 no announcement but we only got a teaser really
[5:44:22] bearbot89: @staysafe will these bans increase or decrease the price of gold on gold sites ?
[5:44:24] h2h_nillz: @Buttsworth no punishment?
[5:44:27] DaddySmelly: I sold gold to guildies in wrath when I was running gdkps lol
[5:44:28] Probulator: oh another thing that will make it hard on gold sellers is, when someone buys gold and gets it in the mail they cant say heres your share from the gdkp now
[5:44:29] Warrlumbus: @hntb100 They did say "and more" at the QoL of life panel
[5:44:44] MC_WhiteNoiz: @daddysmelly and buy all the runs and gear from AH that you no longer have any viable access to
[5:44:45] Buttsworth: @Buttsworth this was classic launch never got caught

[5:45:26] TheEyeVII: @StaysafeTV whether* or not, typo'd earlier, so essentially lemme retype it I guess
[5:45:28] DaddySmelly: @MC_WhiteNoiz I pay my sub to play the game, not to get run through it by a brazilian mage who doesnt know how to play. Nice try though
[5:45:31] PriceMaker: the questions you get are crazy, how in the world would you know these numbers
[5:45:34] MC_WhiteNoiz: This is going to fuck the economy so much harder. People are going to just straight up buy runs
[5:45:40] bots_bots: you think it would more than a regular dungeon run?
[5:45:43] Pwinzor: I did a pvp gdkp today made like 6g to kill horde at DMF and protect warlock summons was prety fun
[5:45:45] bots_bots: a stocks run is liek 10k
[5:45:57] h2h_nillz: @StaysafeTV Advice for good parsing with Locks?

[5:46:20] Nightbot: GIANT SOD NEWS / DISCUSSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:46:20] DKCourtel: @StaysafeTV do you think there is a certain level of botting that is healthy for the game? for instance i play a lot of runescape and the cost of food is kept low due to bots fishing and cooking it and then selling it. a plight on the community that is somewhat accepted
[5:46:31] sigilfish: Prayge
[5:46:41] Warrlumbus: Do you think the new runes will be obtainable in earlier lvls or only 25+?
[5:46:41] Wadjaah: What church tho
[5:46:42] Harles_: fuck that bitch
[5:46:51] VesanTV: @Harles_ well no parses for you buddy
[5:46:53] Vunoka: I've started working out a lot, holy shit I love this feeling
[5:47:05] jameziez: you know things are bad when asmon is the voice of reason

[5:47:08] Harles_: @VesanTV PepeHands
[5:47:15] Smoothiez_: pet
[5:47:31] DaddySmelly: @DKCourtel in a world without bots the economy would be different, probably more balanced. If food costs more at some point it becomes economically viable for players to farm it instead of relying on bots
[5:47:33] Xolf999: gratz on hitting exalted with the warsong faction SeemsGood
[5:47:36] Pwinzor: ya baron is anti fun
[5:47:36] cloakofmoon: best way to parse as a lock is to remove phase shift from imp and then ask mages to buff it, then ur like a hunter being annoying with the usual 'pls buff my pet'
[5:47:38] MC_WhiteNoiz: People being kinda libtards about GDKP hate by just cancelling players because their feelings are hurt regardless of facts.
[5:47:59] leech0000: 6 solo queue wsg wins in a row. I might be the luckiest player ever
[5:48:10] Pwinzor: BASED
[5:48:15] Cenarios13: helping the healers parse BASED
[5:48:21] bots_bots: thats how healer parses NODDERS
[5:48:25] DKCourtel: @DaddySmelly very true! an interesting world it would be!
[5:48:31] Vunoka: Do you like your EU chat or NA chat more generally? @StaysafeTV
[5:48:34] boinky27: @StaysafeTV were not all streamers like you and wont have loot funneled to us from twitch chat. As a shift worker I cant commit to full time guild, I can however BOOST WC a fuck ton so I have a ton of gold I have earned manually. Am I to just try my luck in MS OS pugs and lose to gray parsers on my BIS?
[5:48:34] Smoothiez_: your pet didnt attack
[5:48:37] DaddySmelly: @MC_WhiteNoiz 3iq take, stay mad that you gotta roll now like everyone else
[5:48:54] TheEyeVII: @StaysafeTV when the token was introduced wasn't it basically a bandage on an "open wound" it was never gonna solve the botting problem on retail or any version of wow & obviously it was to make money #1 factor for sure
[5:49:03] sigilfish: true and real monkaHmm
[5:49:14] Cenarios13: @boinky27 join sr grps
[5:49:17] sigilfish: dont talk about 2nd amendment with EUians or Circumcision with NA KEKL

[5:49:39] munk_one1: That doesnt make any sense
[5:49:44] Vunoka: Thanks for such a thorough based take
[5:49:44] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV Why do you want the stealth detect ring?
[5:49:45] h2h_nillz: cut or uncut

[5:50:05] justharri93: you have every people?
[5:50:11] WaffletheMan101: I’m rooting for the BiS warlock to get his last BiS
[5:50:13] justharri93: hate*
[5:50:18] Chama0701: Why not rolling on these shoulders?
[5:50:19] boinky27: @Cenarios13 yea its better, but it ends up being the same as MS OS in the long run, all casters SR staff and helm/neck
[5:50:24] veckec: so, basically, you wanted germany to win? (jk)
[5:50:25] memil141: true
[5:50:29] MayorCraplegs: TAKE THAT GERMANY!
[5:50:34] reeesheep123: that's a wild take lol
[5:50:40] WaffletheMan101: don’t give Texas any ideas
[5:50:41] Hazeium: @StaysafeTV Really? Good luck with the south against the north soon, history will repeat itself
[5:50:42] sigilfish: @TheEyeVII yeah, but the excuse was that Blizzard couldn't battle against bots and then had to introduce WoW Token
[5:50:47] AveragePvp: @hazeium not only that the blatant ignorance to your terrible racism in every European country
[5:50:48] kingpincognito: Don't forget the stabbings.
[5:50:48] memil141: i live in sweden and its fuck we got so mutch gun crime!!!!
[5:50:54] smordan69: Thats counting WW2?
[5:50:56] sigilfish: we've had few wars
[5:50:58] reeesheep123: WWII
[5:50:59] Nightbot: NEW SOD VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir9uYRdcYuI&
[5:51:02] Bazquz: When 50% of the american people think Europe is a country I think Id rather stay european when it comes to stupidity.
[5:51:05] clozer_kek: illegal firearms
[5:51:09] Hazeium: @Bazquz agreed
[5:51:12] ThePeonsChamp: domestic violence tho
[5:51:12] Vunoka: Sweden is probably not helping in that statistic
[5:51:15] Shredmuffn: EU stabbing each other instead LUL
[5:51:17] PriceMaker: @memil141 no wonder with all the people the country took in from the middleeast
[5:51:17] primentity: What about in the last decade?
[5:51:21] Hazeium: I'd rather not live in a country that has an average IQ of room temperature
[5:51:21] memil141: haha :D
[5:51:23] casskai: EU KEKW

[5:51:29] grizz430: kinda drowning yourself out
[5:51:32] sigilfish: KEKL
[5:51:38] MC_WhiteNoiz: @daddysmelly seriously though,  why are you so concerned with how other people play the game? Why are you trying to control others and their freedom? Because you're miserable?
[5:51:47] ChefJoe925: <3
[5:51:53] NutterCircus: Tanking BFD Pog
[5:51:56] tsetse2fly: Chat he's including war in the stat
[5:52:05] ChefJoe925: 1 raiders from ChefJoe925 have joined! 
[5:52:06] clozer_kek: @WaffletheMan101 funded by the same people.
[5:52:09] MC_WhiteNoiz: Because if you cared about the economy you'd be more worried about bots and reducing the inflation not how people spend their earned gold
[5:52:11] Prudas90: why not lake of fire build? it pump way more
[5:52:11] primentity: Yea but that's a war not just random gun violence. Americans just have to have an argument on the sidewalk or a bad day st school lol.

[5:52:39] Arcsilin: an armed society is a polite society
[5:52:40] Iol69: they had fuckin muskets back then
[5:52:42] Brockxs: Europeans act like they dont have to teach sword fighting in their schools now adays LUL
[5:52:48] clozer_kek: The Gubmnt not ur frind
[5:52:55] DaddySmelly: @MC_WhiteNoiz Because the way you play the games encourages RMT and botting
[5:52:57] sigilfish: give every citizen AR-15 and handgun, teach how to use them in schools
[5:52:58] Vunoka: Hi @StaysafeTV which muscle group do you enjoy the most lifting weights?
[5:53:00] nyckcage: Thats a modern intrepretation
[5:53:05] boinky27: @StaysafeTV were not all streamers like you and wont have loot funneled to us from twitch chat. As a shift worker I cant commit to full time guild, I can however BOOST WC a fuck ton so I have a ton of gold I have earned manually. Am I to just try my luck in MS OS pugs and lose to gray parsers on my BIS?
[5:53:17] WaffletheMan101: now gun violence is the leading cause of death in children 14 and under shioYIKES
[5:53:28] voreal22: they where worried about Canada burning the white house down a second time lol
[5:53:28] Boothill: @boinky27 yes
[5:53:31] reeesheep123: @boinky27 yes, stop being an elitist prick
[5:53:34] Iol69: they deserved their muskets
[5:53:36] shadowthehedgehog97: @boinky27 do soft ress runs then blud
[5:53:43] MC_WhiteNoiz: @daddysmelly brother, the games existence promotes rmt and botting. Were you around in vanilla? People were DYING because of gold farming in China. And no one was doing GDKP
[5:54:02] AxelFromAustralia: you couldn’t do a mass shooting with the guns they were talking about though
[5:54:03] sigilfish: BASEDHALT
[5:54:05] aoe_enjoyer: @StaysafeTV were not all streamers like you and wont have loot funneled to us from twitch chat.

[5:54:22] Hazeium: @MC_WhiteNoiz Stay mad, see ya GDKPs
[5:54:28] Arcsilin: learn to socialize
[5:54:37] WaffletheMan101: I’ve only dropped one raid ID in all of SOD
[5:54:39] NutterCircus: Their Logic is freaking staggering.
[5:54:44] DaddySmelly: @MC_WhiteNoiz It is clearly and observably worse now than it was in Vanilla
[5:54:46] Iol69: @arlaster no one ever mentions that part. they said that shit when they had old ass muskets
[5:54:49] sigilfish: OMEGALUL
[5:54:54] jakmko: Most tanks get bored of tanking
[5:54:56] tsetse2fly: holy fuck you don't neeed more than MS>OS in an 10-man raid to get geat @boinky27
[5:54:57] dave3ooo: yeah, he's not asmon
[5:54:58] ninjaskurk: SR pugs are great though
[5:54:59] reeesheep123: that part lol
[5:55:01] aoe_enjoyer: been in demon raids for weeks
[5:55:01] tsetse2fly: *gear
[5:55:05] Harles_: @boinky27 monkaHmm
[5:55:07] sigilfish: people need to tune in during the scuffed raids KEKL
[5:55:14] Pwinzor: I bet most of the viewers are playing alliance or on other servers LUL
[5:55:14] MC_WhiteNoiz: @daddysmelly literally wrong. It was national news in 2005.
[5:55:15] Mertauh: literally opened LFG bulletin board, whispered a guy who doesn't know who you are, here we are LuL
[5:55:20] casskai: @boinky27 link the logs!
[5:55:34] SpoolyZ02: did you ever listen to coast to coast on the radio back in the day
[5:55:34] Arcsilin: @ninjaskurk are the best
[5:55:39] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV i work 60 hours a week and have time to trade chat pug 3 characters per lock out each week.
[5:55:39] dustydollars2121: guns dont kill people.... mentally ill people on doctor prescribed medication kill people(sometimes with guns)
[5:55:46] gnomezayin1: @pwinzor don't hate on my gnomes
[5:55:47] SpoolyZ02: or john b wells
[5:55:49] Hazeium: @MC_WhiteNoiz Oh no it was national news 15 YEARS AGO. Holy fuck man get a grip, you're delusional.
[5:55:58] KrotonGG: Missing fire pot
[5:55:59] sigilfish: @dustydollars2121 true, real and based
[5:56:01] XarcTV: im sure your all caught up, but amazing sod news today wooo
[5:56:17] sigilfish: columbine really kicked it off i feel like
[5:56:23] clozer_kek: scripted
[5:56:31] Pwinzor: @gnomezayin1 I'm also a BASED Gnome
[5:56:37] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV Wasn't it happening at all before 1990s? Or just incresed then
[5:56:46] XarcTV: hello btw
[5:56:49] AxelFromAustralia: I blame video games
[5:56:51] sigilfish: also finland, canada, switzerland don't really have this same problem but they all have a lot of guns
[5:56:54] SpoolyZ02: the issue is broken homes
[5:57:02] Vunoka: @SpoolyZ02 precisely
[5:57:03] bots_bots: but why  does america have so much more than other countries?
[5:57:09] gnomezayin1: @pwinzor gnomes are master race
[5:57:12] MC_WhiteNoiz: Do people not realize this will not impact the economy? The bots will still pump and players will have less ways to play. Guess I should expect fascism from this chat. People will still do GDKP in discord it's not going to stop.
[5:57:13] Mertauh: Not fully semi-automatic though Kappa
[5:57:23] Greetten: 0 guns are even less deadly
[5:57:24] Harles_: @vunoka yea and alot of shit being put into young peoples heads today
[5:57:24] sigilfish: looking it as gun problem is beyond retarded
[5:57:29] reeesheep123: it really says something about modern america for sure
[5:57:39] dave3ooo: easier access to military grade weapons definitely isn't the case
[5:57:40] Dhisss: guns are not the problem, the people are >.<
[5:57:44] TheSanguist: Look at China and the insane numbers of school stabbings.  Violence towards schools is just up.
[5:57:46] Iol69: @sigilfish NA has like like almost zero support for mental health care
[5:57:49] WaffletheMan101: gun production has also massively increased in the last 30 years
[5:57:52] TheEyeVII: @sigilfish no mmo has ever "solved" the botting problem literally in 30 years of that genre existing, the wow token at least gives the money you'd already lose from RMT anyway to be used by the game owners/IPs etc
[5:57:54] sigilfish: @Iol69 yeah, its not great
[5:57:55] dave3ooo: but it is metal health issue too
[5:57:57] MC_WhiteNoiz: You would rather "own" someone than tackle the actual issue because you're petty.
[5:57:57] leo__ch: It's an American thing for sure tho xD
[5:58:09] SpoolyZ02: i dont even think glorification of guns is the reason, it starts at home

[5:58:19] PleaseeStop: capitalism in an oligarchy skyrockets depression
[5:58:19] sigilfish: @TheEyeVII but it boosts the issue instead of fixing it, economy is beyond repairing in Retail

[5:58:53] egduj_: women destroying america!!! tyler1Z
[5:58:57] dave3ooo: @MaybeRespect big si, in the south people use to straight up have shottys in the back windows of their trucks at school
[5:58:58] MaybeRespect: Didn't they find kids end up better off w/ single father vs. single mother.
[5:59:01] AustralianOiler: Industrial society ofc
[5:59:02] zUg_zUg_: cultural values
[5:59:07] reeesheep123: BASED

[5:59:14] MaybeRespect: @dave3ooo That's what im saying bro. Lol
[5:59:23] MaybeRespect: @dave3ooo Good ol days
[5:59:29] nahkhiir45: whats the title mean?
[5:59:33] DaddySmelly: @mc_whitenoiz short sighted take. This will definitely have an impact on botting
[5:59:36] zUg_zUg_: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
[5:59:41] Vunoka: The future is gonna be interesting thats for sure
[5:59:59] Iol69: get wrecked gdkps
[6:00:01] projects_pkz: GDKP ruined my wrath experience
[6:00:03] thottboi: GDKP in wrath is perfectly fine tho?
[6:00:05] projects_pkz: st8 up
[6:00:10] WaffletheMan101: the internet is causing a massive breakdown in typical social circles, as well as the removal of nearly all free public spaces, parks etc
[6:00:10] sigilfish: GDKP is extremely off putting
[6:00:11] Vunoka: This song is ultra fucking BASED
[6:00:15] Hazeium: @MC_WhiteNoiz Aight, have fun with your little circle jerk of retarded friends
[6:00:21] Cygin: catJAM
[6:00:30] Mertauh: GDKP culture is a commodity culture not a community culture
[6:00:34] Luke_the_Lucky: i saw perturbator 5 years ago, so good!
[6:00:35] JUICY604: how are they going to police the gdkp Staysafe?
[6:00:37] reeesheep123: @thottboi IMO it's too far gone to try and fix at this point. that's why they added the token
[6:00:49] shadowthehedgehog97: @Hazeium removing gdksp === less ways to play the game XD
[6:00:56] SpoolyZ02: Now we are seeing school shootings more frequently in euro countries though
[6:00:57] PleaseeStop: credit card andys buying thousands of gold and then sitting in gdkp buying their bis is so cringe why even play the game lmao
[6:01:01] pengwin06: i honestly think the internet and social media has a big effect on school shootings
[6:01:07] DaddySmelly: @staysafetv will be interesting to see what the penalty is for gdkp
[6:01:07] Vunoka: You've showed me a lot of music over the years now, thanks a lot for that Matt <3
[6:01:08] zUg_zUg_: thoughts on future for classic + post SoD?

[6:03:03] MaybeRespect: @WaffletheMan101 Solution?
[6:03:13] Iol69: @SpoolyZ02 need much better access to mental health care
[6:03:14] Sawfthandz: I dont think guns should equate to shooting people in schools. Maybe its the culture and mental health crisis that is more a causality.
[6:03:14] re5onxnce: seriously
[6:03:26] divadnothsa: Last boss for sure
[6:03:31] MaybeRespect: @Iol69 Need to fix the cause not just treat the symptom

[6:04:10] batmern_: emoneyJam
[6:04:48] NutterCircus: The solution wont be a popular one.
[6:04:54] WaffletheMan101: @mayberespect adding public safety nets, expanding healthcare, restoring prior regulations and enforcing anti monopoly laws, promoting unions, advocating for worker owned businesses (giving them like tax breaks and stuff)
[6:05:01] Sawfthandz: Exactly my point. The guns are not the issue here.
[6:05:13] Shredmuffn: copy cat crime
[6:05:14] dustydollars2121: ITS THE MEDICATIONS PEOPLE !!! WAKE UP!!
[6:05:20] bots_bots: but why does the US have so many more than any other country?
[6:05:36] mikey0105: politicians need to be held accountable on both sides, to many of them being outed as shit bags. need a better way to follow the money trail, or follow it to even begin with.
[6:05:42] anyok: yeah guns arent shooting people kek
[6:05:47] clozer_kek: reverse speach on G control
[6:05:48] SpoolyZ02: I mean it makes sense, just like how Christianity isn't rigid enough. People are allowed to be loose with their morales with no repercussions
[6:05:50] MaybeRespect: @bots_bots Which country specifically. That's a loaded question
[6:05:52] egduj_: mental health care could be perfect it doesnt matter. there will always be a crazy person committing a big crime

[6:05:59] MaXxXtreeM: Is the ban on fully-automatic guns really that significant?
[6:05:59] dustydollars2121: @anyok have you ever seen a gun fire on its own??
[6:06:10] clozer_kek: straight brain = pwn one
[6:06:13] Sawfthandz: But... what kills more people/ Guns or cigarettes..
[6:06:55] clozer_kek: The U's> will never be invaded by firearms
[6:07:05] WaffletheMan101: @staysafetv the same thing can be said about GDKPs they aren’t the only reason people buy gold but if sensible gun laws can reduce the rates of gun violence why not implement them. Stuff like closing the Charleston loophole or requiring like a 24-72 hour wait to purchase one (54% of gun deaths are self inflicted)
[6:07:06] dustydollars2121: A gun is an inanimate object....
[6:07:24] Sawfthandz: Wait what kills more? Guns.. or doctors who give abortions
[6:07:27] SpoolyZ02: Imagine going back to medieval times and telling people to give up their bow's and and swords
[6:07:28] bots_bots: @bots_bots HUH the US had more than 10 times the global average of mass shootings in 2023... the answer is literally EVERY other country

Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog.

[6:27:52] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV I think the "America has no culture" meme is because low iq retards dont realize that American culture is the baseline culture of all western countries
[6:27:52] theradoor: thats retarted to be fair :(
[6:28:08] theradoor: sorry for my wording.
[6:28:10] TheSanguist: Considering what was done by Germany in the past, do you consider that akin to White guilt in America?
[6:28:15] daijahaden: Smart way to decrease immigration from the muslim world without explicitly doing so.

[6:29:48] Marnikx: @StaysafeTV what happend with the border dispute btw? u were hyping that up alot
[6:29:51] SpoolyZ02: Because we want to be able to fend for ourselves
[6:30:05] TurboBased: thats our ethos
[6:30:05] reeesheep123: true, I don't want my government in my business
[6:30:06] Silassio: America is a better build Europe, in terms of food and architecture due to the fact it is build later than all the European cities. And its where all cultures came together to build one thing.
[6:30:09] Razaco_: Always have a spare pack of glizzies
[6:30:13] NutterCircus: Americans want to be left alone.
[6:30:14] Sawfthandz: So like the Swiss?
[6:30:17] Macwall: we got atleast the law of jante

[6:31:19] theradoor: Yeah its insane to think about, but nothing but respect for that way of life. As you said, Americans want to feel independent and self-sufficient :)
[6:31:22] Iol69: @gambleragain we also got assloads
[6:31:24] coeursiy: @Bagnasty differences are extremely exaggerated. a dakotan and a georgian will have way more in common with each other than with any type of foreigner

[6:31:44] Petrkin: imagine thinking this way and not having two world wars happening mainly on your land lol
[6:31:44] DaddySmelly: @gambleragain I don't get it. My point is the majority of western countries consume american tv and movies, american music, american food, conduct business similar to the american style. I say this having lived in the US for 4 years, the UK for 7, Australia for 3 and Germany for the last 2
[6:31:50] SpoolyZ02: Do you think we would feel the need for "freedom" if our country was not so involved with the worlds affairs?

[6:33:06] craboskai: @DaddySmelly america didn't invent burgers chicken nuggets and fries KEKL
[6:33:06] shadowthehedgehog97: @DaddySmelly they also consume their own countries food, tv shows, movies and music
[6:33:20] bryggx: You've said differently earlier. What changed?

[6:34:36] raspyoftow: ya too many whiney crying people here
[6:34:41] TheSanguist: Moving to Calli is just giving up everything that it means to be American. :D
[6:34:44] coeursiy: @Bagnasty language is just a part of the equation. the US and nigeria have a shared language and are as different culturally as you can be
[6:34:58] stankypanky22: not really lmao
[6:35:01] stankypanky22: thats like africa
[6:35:05] Sawfthandz: If everyone is pro-independence, then they are all enemies at the back door.

[6:36:36] Iol69: california is beautiful
[6:36:39] gambleragain: @DaddySmelly Consuming american TV and movies(hollywood mainly) is not a valid point. It comes down to money and investment. What america is doing is not particularly American, but rather just being an American product with a larget reach to the world.

I think the fact places like Netflix make such a large amount of brainrot content that is seen by millions around the world is why people have a warped perception of the US

[6:42:56] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV why not hit record in OBS when you start react and stop when you finish so you don't have to go through the render process?
[6:42:57] TheSanguist: I'm an American living in Europe.  I also lived in Texas before moving here.   Immigration really wouldn't be such an issue if people coming in respected the culture they are adopting into.  But if you want to fight it, and act like where you come from is better, then you get push back.
[6:43:01] TheEyeVII: @Uk0h any source?
[6:43:13] stankypanky22: how many gigs is the file??? lmao its surely 10x larger than the source

[6:44:06] SpoolyZ02: Immigration talks always have me conflicted, being a Mixed African American/Caucasian male. My existence wouldn't be possible had either side of my family not of been here in the past

[6:44:18] stankypanky22: @Iol69 theres a lot of those here KEKW
[6:44:25] ChillyHTX: no shit

[6:44:29] osopolar1977: anywhere you are a minority people will stare and assume the worst

[6:44:45] AlfredGreyBeard: it’s not immigrants in whole, it’s more mass asylum seekers and refugees. Those usually seek a “better life”, contribute very little but want all the benefits
[6:44:45] TurboBased: YEP

[6:45:05] stankypanky22: how is that possible when they need to also work and pay taxes here?
[6:45:05] bonius_: @TheSanguist The 2nd gen / 3rd gen issue is also an issue, they want to be closer to their ethnic origins and reject where they grew up

[6:46:13] sigilfish: @ChillyHTX thanks, i wont that interaction
[6:46:14] NutterCircus: The most common argument I get from the Illegals around where I live is, they are running from Cartel Violence. Which I believe is shit.

[6:47:32] TheEyeVII: japan has a declining population tho & now they gotta import seasonal workers etc for everything LUL

[6:48:02] NutterCircus: I think they are implying the Immigration is the same thing... KEKL
[6:48:03] clozer_kek: Native's #1 ... America first (the ones that could adapt.)
[6:48:04] sigilfish: did they have coherent culture or did every tribe have their own thing going on? monkaHmm
[6:48:12] gigera6653: in a perfect world... speaking from the heart...

[6:48:15] TheEyeVII: some people would say invasion but that's harsh
[6:48:18] stankypanky22: no roads = no immigration
[6:48:20] gambleragain: they just occupied land
[6:48:21] osopolar1977: lost home field advantage
[6:48:31] ChillyHTX: but they still immigrated
[6:48:32] sigilfish: native american history is also hella romanticized

[6:48:58] stankypanky22: do you think native americans have done a good job assimilating to america?
[6:49:01] reeesheep123: more of an invasion than immigration. tragic tbh
[6:49:02] osopolar1977: I don’t care we won and they are mad about that
[6:49:04] re5onxnce: they were killing eachother long before
[6:49:08] Bagnasty: @coeursiy yeah take a look how many fucking nurses are Filipino in UK, US, Aus lol...why would hospitals pay to bring those ppl in
[6:49:11] NutterCircus: Americans are the most skilled in violence.
[6:49:15] osopolar1977: That’s why they hate us
[6:49:25] coeursiy: @Bagnasty because they're willing to work for lower wages, clearly
[6:49:31] osopolar1977: cause we number one
[6:49:38] SpoolyZ02: Do you think it's all their fault.. or is it forced issues upon them
[6:49:39] Petrkin: man talk about being delusional
[6:49:48] daijahaden: Well ain't our fault the injuns weren't living in squalor next to farm animals like us Euros, and thus couldn't handle our diseases. That's on them.
[6:49:49] Moldytacox: Native Americans never "assimilating". America tried to erase them.
[6:49:56] TheEyeVII: I think you're looking for the word "colonized" TwitchConHYPE  wasn't a conquest at all
[6:50:00] Azenics: @Bagnasty yeah and if there werent so many immigrants there would be less need for said nurses in the first place
[6:50:01] osopolar1977: they know we won
[6:50:05] ChillyHTX: Bro fuck assimilating, help ur neighbors, talk to others, listen to speech
[6:50:09] TheSanguist: We didn't "try" anything.  We did.
[6:50:10] ChillyHTX: its so easy

[6:50:35] TurboBased: it was nasty
[6:50:38] ChillyHTX: @StaysafeTV ur reacting wrong, u need to  pull up the chatters logs then debate for full interaction
[6:50:38] stankypanky22: they primarily died due to disease tho lol
[6:50:40] Petrkin: now compare imigrants comming to eu to ppl from eu comming to us
[6:50:41] Frank4LuLz: spain destroyed mexico, and the aztecs
[6:50:49] osopolar1977: get politicians out of war we conquer the world
[6:50:54] NutterCircus: They PAID FOR SCALPS...
[6:50:58] bonius_: How do you feel about treaties signed with Native American nations in the 1800s that give them "rights" to land that the government just doesn't honor

[6:51:08] h2h_nillz: @StaysafeTV Do you know the story of Killers of the flower moon? The book is amazing
[6:51:09] TheSanguist: I think the problem is people think we came in, made them walk the Trail of Tears... and that's it.  There was a lot of battles.  A lot of them allying themselves with other countries.  It was war.
[6:51:26] stankypanky22: @TheSanguist bro 99% of natives died bc of disease lmao
[6:51:26] itska97: @daijahaden not our fault lol we brough diseases to them cause how nasty we were lmaooo
[6:51:28] DaddySmelly: @StaysafeTV It's a pretty amazing book/story

[6:52:23] TimeToBeNude: yes
[6:52:27] gambleragain: @dustydollars2121 The killer of the llower moon
[6:52:29] ChillyHTX: @dustydollars2121 how so, I prolly agree with you. I just think its best to speak to others, understand where they come from. then find mutual similarities to build off of. but ruling people out seems dumb
[6:52:33] osopolar1977: me go white land
[6:52:39] theradoor: In Denmark, those kind of people are called wellfare-immigrants
[6:52:43] TurboBased: you had to have huge balls
[6:53:00] ktj2: even the trip was insane back then
[6:53:05] dustydollars2121: @ChillyHTX Funny you say that... part of assimilating is learning the language
[6:53:10] ChillyHTX: dustydollars2121 if everything was assimilated in a utopia you would have no cultural divergence
[6:53:13] TurboBased: even the trip was hazardous
[6:53:18] TheSanguist: I played Oregon Trails.  I know how easy it was to die.

[6:57:34] divadnothsa: How's ashenvale ATM?
[6:57:36] TheSanguist: It wasn't incorrect either.  Back then, if you were in a position where you needed a level of assistance from society to function, chances are you were just going to die.  They didn't care enough to provide assistance.  So why would they have social programs if they saw you as expendable ?
[6:57:39] SpoolyZ02: @ChillyHTX as long as they are spending some of there money here I dont see an issue, It's impossible to move here make a living and send 100 percent of it back to their original country
[6:57:40] MaybeRespect: Well, people have been taught to believe everything, including history, is black and white. There's no critical thinking happening. Unfortunate.

[6:59:11] ChillyHTX: @dustydollars2121 labor is half ther price in TX
[6:59:15] kneppemanden: THEY are the racists
[6:59:16] Bagnasty: they should only be able to immigrate is are hot, big boobs
[6:59:17] osopolar1977: not reality
[6:59:18] MaybeRespect: You should ask them if they lock their doors at night....
[6:59:19] NutterCircus: "We are such a Rich Country, we should give it away."
[6:59:19] imradioaktive: no
[6:59:19] TheEyeVII: @StaysafeTV depends on when you're referring I guess, early colonies were there to colonize eventually there was conquest campaigns for more territories etc, both thigns can be true depending on the timeline TwitchConHYPE
[6:59:22] pisketti: First they say it's a far right conspiracy. Then they say it can't be stopped. Then they say it's a good thing. Then they say you deserve it.
[6:59:25] dicer1999: Europe is facing trouble because of those non borders LUL everywhere in europe u see problems
[6:59:26] Rejuvenate: everytime I come in here, there's talks about the border, or politics. maybe I peep at the wrong time tho haha
[6:59:26] Beamstout: I am jealous of you having Rogue brewing in your backyard
[6:59:31] Moldytacox: Sanctuary cities are scary af
[6:59:34] osopolar1977: why are we listening to these people
[6:59:36] SpoolyZ02: Sure... because castles back in the day had no walls. Im okay with a border, as long as people can still migrate legally
[6:59:38] Petrkin: Well i dont think you if you put yourself through lenses of any human being that someone invade their land and try to push them of it or kill them you would welcome them with open arms, that is why i said talk about being delusional
[6:59:38] einself111: @StaysafeTV saw this on reddit perfect way to shut down gdkps for the most part.   https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1aefyti/a_good_take_on_how_to_handle_gdkps/
[6:59:42] ChillyHTX: @dustydollars2121 I hired a person that walked from equador at the age of 16
[6:59:46] membaberrytv: From my experience with OSRS, they kept saying if you use OpenOSRS (a third party client) you'll get banned. We all kept using it and after a point they gave a final warning (boy who cried wolf situation) and ultimately banned thouuusands of people for 2 weeks or perma-banned.
[6:59:47] ChillyHTX: he doin well now
[6:59:48] NutterCircus: Too many people believe
[6:59:54] bryggx: That doesn't sound dangerous at all
[6:59:55] NutterCircus: Civilization is Guaranteed.
[6:59:58] Haziosaka: Then expand US territory to south America. Problem solved!
[7:00:01] KillaChinchilla_1: Poland is the best EU country regarding immigration at the moment
[7:00:03] membaberrytv: So, taking their warning seriously earlier is better than waiting for a fat ban wave
[7:00:03] EmanuShow: Its easy take when living far away from the border
[7:00:08] dustydollars2121: @ChillyHTX because he worked for cheap.... im sure that feels good
[7:00:09] TheSanguist: @daijahaden - I wouldn't really look at the charity of the church back in those days as the soup kitchen style help you are thinking.  It almost always came with heavy caveats.  Often to accumulate followers to better provide political clout.
[7:00:10] sigilfish: JB PogU
[7:00:10] basic94: that argumentation where you are supposed to feel bad for something you have no responsibility over is so rancid
[7:00:14] bonius_: If they block gold trading in raids making far more annoying,  or if they ban even 10-20% of GDKPers for a week/month it
[7:00:14] bikersrocha: Have you read Murray Rothbard "Conceived in Liberty"?
[7:00:18] sigilfish: he was talking about retail btw
[7:00:23] MaybeRespect: @ChillyHTX Is this some type of moral/social achievement?
[7:00:26] ChillyHTX: @dustydollars2121 I asked him where did u come from? he said he took 3 trains from equador, and ended up here. I helped him land a job
[7:00:32] bonius_: it would scare ppl
[7:00:37] TheEyeVII: that's jb he does m+
[7:00:44] Arcsilin: trolling and ninja loots gaalore
[7:00:44] ChillyHTX: he didnt workjed for cheap
[7:00:52] ChillyHTX: he earned our wage
[7:00:54] dustydollars2121: @ChillyHTX he helped you not pay an american a real wage.
[7:00:57] MrPink604: verify gold before hand
[7:01:00] sigilfish: that is honeytrap for drama
[7:01:04] NutterCircus: It would turn into Lists.
[7:01:07] Doomgu: thats a big barrier to entry
[7:01:08] ChillyHTX: @dustydollars2121 yes ur right
[7:01:13] MrPink604: or escrow gold into a third party bnak
[7:01:15] AustralianOiler: Have ppl put a deposit down pre-raid
[7:01:17] pengwin06: or just trade the gold on an alt
[7:01:17] ezmxde: or you could just trade gold into a pot prior
[7:01:19] Pixiieboy: Hahah! Why does all try to work around it xd

[7:01:31] ChillyHTX: @dustydollars2121 He helped us saved money. but at the same time... I gave him a chance and it changed his life
[7:01:33] dustydollars2121: @ChillyHTX keep selling out your fellow countrymen
[7:01:33] Brenno_Mc: I just traded gold for a shadow pot 30 mins ago in BFD
[7:01:34] forlifo: they cant stop Gdkbs
[7:01:35] sweatlordkush: BASED NO GOLD TRADING IN INSTANCES WOULD FIX ALOT
[7:01:38] NutterCircus: Making it inconveinient is the way.
[7:01:39] TheEyeVII: @StaysafeTV people will make a guild & invite their "friends" simple enough
[7:01:39] sigilfish: YEP
[7:01:41] KillaChinchilla_1: Log out, send gold or trade gold with other chars
[7:01:42] pengwin06: people will login to alts, trade gold, and get the gear on mains
[7:01:43] Uk0h: What if they just removed loot from instances all together and replaced it all with BoP totems/tokens that would be used to exchange for loot at vendors?
[7:01:44] sigilfish: fuck GDKPs
[7:01:48] bonius_: So it lowers the amount of GDKPs, even moving more towards just plain boosts for a flat fee like in retail
[7:01:55] ChillyHTX: @dustydollars2121 Ill see ytou in the trenches im not selling out anyone
[7:01:58] itska97: i can gdkps being ran in guilds only where you send gold thru mail after raids mayber

[7:02:24] SpoolyZ02: @ChillyHTX @dustydollars2121 it's hard to give Americans a priority of certain jobs when they wont work them
[7:02:29] NutterCircus: Shut IT DOWN! EleGiggle
[7:02:35] Fluff_McGruff_: has there been any talk about transmog in SoD or am i imagining things
[7:02:36] DaddySmelly: @itska97 that only works til someone leaves in a rage and reports
