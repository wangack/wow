[2:13:12] Parcelazo: headBang EDM Headbang EDM
[2:13:13] LogiTheBear: Its good, it was a good idea to wait a month or so after the release to put out the XP buff.
[2:13:13] Nalefyr: Depends on how fast P3 is coming out
[2:13:15] vahngogeta: dungeons shouldnt get exp buff
[2:13:15] ipositive: im actually gonna level my alts now

[2:13:17] wilde_jagd: people will be able to level alts more and not just raid log
[2:13:18] Zagathor: the problem is people feel like theyre late bc so many people gatekeep the raids. It would be better for new players if they would group up themselves rather than rely on older players
[2:13:23] Traitmark: i wasn't sure about it at first but i think it's a good change
[2:13:23] tw1ZTER: am i too late to spam ABOBAVIX ?

[2:13:28] Phunsox: It is a seasonal server... so ya it works
[2:13:34] hellscream_199: @Savix we have classic then Som 1 Som 2 who the hell wanna lvl again and again and again
[2:13:38] definitely_not_sure: we already had classic relaunch Shruge it's still there, if they want slow leveling they can go do it om
[2:13:38] Fourleaf_TV: you can turn it off?
[2:13:39] krulfar: ofc not, thats retarded
[2:13:41] ragnof_: fuck no they want everyone to be crutched lol
[2:13:41] jhk97: no way, they want everyone else to level slow
[2:13:44] Parcelazo: ABOBAVIX SALAMIhand is never to late for aboba
[2:13:45] DwarfCowboy: just hard to catch up on runes gathering them. Sometime hard to find help with them
[2:13:46] themanjake2020: Its not classic though, its literally classic +
[2:13:53] sausauge_monster: when people ask if its too late its mostly because its hard to break into end game content since the expectation is youre on farm at this point
[2:13:54] druidfisen: @Savix i think the xp buff is great if it isnt your first character on the realm
[2:13:54] BurntTunaTV: ddHuh turn it off haha
[2:13:55] therealimpendium: Oh I know they don't want to turn it off
[2:13:57] halberg_: kills some of the elitisme from classic andys
[2:13:57] 00Absurd: yes

[2:14:04] ragnof_: yea that would be better
[2:14:09] surgento: classic players love to whine

[2:14:28] CamGG__: as a variety gamer I am very thankful for buff
[2:14:29] Phunsox: the rep grind is ruff
[2:14:30] HidekiKojima: I'm leveling but fuck the rep LULW
[2:14:33] ragnof_: how is anyone punishing you by not catering to your slowness thats a bad take
[2:14:37] jhk97: @surgento humans love to whine, has nothing to do with classic players whatsoever
[2:14:39] OniLinux: im right there with you grandpa
[2:14:42] fanofsavix: reputation is always the problem I don‘t understand why they keep bringing that shit
[2:14:48] Outside_R: yea the rep grind is what's making me apprehensive towards leveling an alt

[4:44:20] MrPink604: @Savix I really liked BFD cause I could hop on and pug a run in like 35-45 minutes gnomer takes way too long

[4:44:55] kenxxys: gnomer takes 50 min lol
[4:45:06] wreckstormx: we did gnomer in about 45 mins today
[4:45:08] Syloa: it requires more brains than bfd for sure
[4:45:15] Gsuque: 20 years of wow and they still thinking a lot of trash mobs on a raid is a good thing, is so cancer
[4:45:17] Deadge_Gartic: bro your bfd clears were like 20 mins om
[4:45:19] Kurama__95: It's a difference in expectation, some just want a farm run, others need a prog run, and both don't really go along
[4:45:19] MrPink604: it takes a few hours to get into a pug as a ret
[4:45:23] Mythirun: long
[4:45:24] Cykon56: savix where's the hunter eyes of the beast ganking stream?
[4:45:25] yourfavcolour: I have 7 kids and 3 jobs, gnomer takes too long
[4:45:26] BotKobo: its kinda long
[4:45:27] listrel1: BFD takes 30-40 minutes. Gnomer is 50-60 but finding a group takes wayyy longer
[4:45:28] wreckstormx: its not long
[4:45:30] heyimtazz: Its a good pace one your have no wipes
[4:45:31] Grubbawurm: I wish I could do either raids my guild doesn't do it or community is impossible to get in I feel like

[4:45:33] catnograss: could be 10 mins shorter
[4:45:33] AceOfRoars: nah it's fine
[4:45:35] heyimtazz: once you*
[4:45:37] kiltun04: @naboo69 I feel like the log checking mind set has been brought from there, classic was never like that before
[4:45:40] SirCreations: Gnomer is just toxic right now.
[4:45:44] mysteriousm4n: it's fine
[4:45:45] Cykon56: savix where's the eyes of the beast ganking stream?
[4:45:46] relayca: @yourfavcolour 23 kids and 5 jobs gnomer is too long
[4:45:48] Madwo: cowJAM
[4:45:50] luixun: sunken tempel will take longer
[4:45:54] thefoxborough69: peepoPls
[4:45:56] AceOfRoars: the problem is minmaxing players being toxic yeah
[4:46:01] bomann_c4: think about BRD. thats the classic "spirit" in my opinion. i think gnomer has a good length or maybe even too short
[4:46:06] EFFSIN: im trying 2 tame a bot
[4:46:06] ChuHatesYou: hamsterDance
[4:46:09] Tobloo: Gnomer has always been toxic. It's full of radiation
[4:46:09] voidzyxd: @Savix i cant even get in groups on my new alt when i have 2 toon 95+ logs lol
[4:46:09] Vasovius: irradiation
[4:46:10] kodouka: its all about the logs
[4:46:10] Mico027: IMO the only things thats not pug friendly in gnomer is the last boss and managin bombs
[4:46:12] Dogewiz: Bengal tiger was found?
[4:46:14] corsair714: I hope its not ST
[4:46:20] bilbo_bohannans: feels a little long for a 3 day lockout raid
[4:46:20] corsair714: such a boring fuckin instance
[4:46:21] BotKobo: savix are you saying the average classic player is worse than a casual ffxiv player LULW
[4:46:21] A_Cold_0ne: i dunno how they could let BRD not be a raid
[4:46:22] SirCreations: Like the "Raid Leader" needing to know what my GPA was in high school and College to get in. that kind of toxic.
[4:46:23] Mythirun: gnomer is kind of a not pug friendly tbh @savix
[4:46:25] tw1ZTER: KEK toxic cuz theres too much "poison" damage KEK
[4:46:26] kiltun04: If they got rid of Raid ID’s the problem would be fixed I think
[4:46:27] holyrs: just go with grps that have 0 requirments , did one today , and did 6/6 ez
[4:46:36] Madwo: HmmNotes
[4:46:36] greywind317: St being a raid would be nasty but they should make ZF a raid
[4:46:41] luixun: the datamining confirmed it already as the next raid. and you not even can skip things because last boss will trigger all the trash
[4:46:49] phiAnthony91: i like doing it right before reset its a fiesta
[4:46:53] mysteriousm4n: just make your own group reset day
[4:46:53] Gsuque: They should go with less trash mobs and more boss room for mechanics
[4:46:54] erafor9: procrastinators always pay
[4:46:56] voidzyxd: om
[4:46:57] greywind317: and make that stair fight some crazy fight
[4:46:58] OniLinux: someone say healer?
[4:46:59] Cykon56: savix where's the eyes of the beast ganking stream?
[4:46:59] wreckstormx: ppl thinking gnomer is too long isnt gonna have fun at 60
[4:47:01] StealthyNakroth: waaaay less raiders than p1 it feels
[4:47:04] BotKobo: gm OniLinux
[4:47:10] DMGlol: heals in general are a huge pain regardless of day
[4:47:14] bluesteelshot: Carry me through gnomer plz
[4:47:16] A_Cold_0ne: @luixun they have been feeding things to data miners every phase
[4:47:18] stork_leg: Do you think MC will be on a 3 Day Reset, considering it's 20 man change?
[4:47:26] Deadge_Gartic: why are you stalling last 5 level LULW

[4:47:35] Deadge_Gartic: naaah savix
[4:47:36] relayca: the only thing i dont like about gnomer are the 3 mobs that have to die at the same time
[4:47:37] SirCreations: I love SOD but im really not feeling the interview process to do these raids. its wayy tooo extensive.
[4:47:37] erafor9: same
[4:47:38] luixun: the struggle is only the fact that you are not finding good groups without loggs then they mostly casuals who hr items like crazy xD
[4:47:38] Eelz255: 1-25 takes like 12 hours, 25-40 takes way longer than that. Your casual player is just hitting 40 now...
[4:47:39] Deadge_Gartic: go level your warlock
[4:47:39] voidzyxd: youd be done by now LOL
[4:47:40] Naboo69: @kiltun04 Feels like my experience is the opposite, retail players just send the raid and didn't care since boss has like 3 mechs
[4:47:40] balduar101: lol my main just got 40 on thur
[4:47:41] Ayr4eshner: what is the return on investment for ret pala?
