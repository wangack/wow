[2:41:48] Strugglehugs: Train pally no balls
[2:42:01] scardrextv: @shaayynee Probably why the game is so inactive right now, because so many alt f4d
[2:42:02] scardrextv: XD
[2:42:23] hucking: man when double dh was a comp that was actually played in tournies i wanted to throw up
[2:42:27] hucking: not as bad as when tank was played in tournies tho
[2:42:50] shaayynee: @scardrextv dont blame them, honestly they should do like a 30% dmg nerf to all classes fuck it
[2:43:07] shaayynee: i actually dunno but since SL i feel like your hp jus drops too fast for almost no reason
[2:43:21] gio_jitsu_: games are already pretty damp when people know what they're doing. 30% dam nerf would be too much
[2:43:35] scardrextv: just nerf dh and rogue and i will be happy
