[1:42:06] eskeettiiit: maybe they should just layer lower level zones
[1:42:13] neevir: Add new servers and merge them later no need for layers
[1:42:25] tufloo: And they should put in more servers
[1:42:36] eskeettiiit: that aswell but i dont think we need 10 layers on the higher level zones XD
[1:42:37] RiptoreCA: Yeah, I just mean, if Blizzard has an issue with them they could reduce and eliminate layers. They don't care enough to do so
[1:42:55] MartianPK: seems like an exploit that shouldnt be abused for Hardcore, maybe just me
[1:42:59] eskeettiiit: low level zones feel crowded with 10 layers but after 40 its pretty dead XD

[2:35:11] SplatastictheRealOne: would be nice to use for a fury warr.
[2:35:28] twerkmcbootyclap: You will die if you raid

[2:38:20] twerkmcbootyclap: What’s the end game for hardcore?
[2:38:20] SplatastictheRealOne: I think they caught on when other players found out they could get a substantial amount of a alternate Rogue Ability for a small bit of gold in game.
[2:38:44] LitheHS: It’s on the sign post
[2:38:51] Tordrek_: its the poster on the door

[2:40:41] Hamners: END GAME HC is collecting ears
[2:41:07] SplatastictheRealOne: I think they should lower the raid stats to 20/25 Man cause 40 Man was the most insane

[3:06:56] Elementalqt: Hello Yaz
[3:07:13] Dig_Playz: Shroud could play Minesweeper and make it look fun to be honest
[3:07:15] Hpiz: It's Skyrim in space!
[3:07:16] Maxoru0: Yes
[3:07:42] Spart4nm4n: hello dan @Elementalqt
[3:08:01] jimzyz98ttv: i think of guardian of the galaxy when i see Starfield :D
[3:08:06] Spart4nm4n: hows life, we in teagens discord if you wanna chat
[3:08:13] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: I already have a lot of pet peeves about the game. Haven't even done the third question, the main story and I'm on normal difficulty and already have a legendary pistol
[3:08:27] Dig_Playz: Unfortunately from what I've heard, read, and seen Starfield is another one of those games that launches with a bunch of issues
[3:08:47] imoxyr6: Starcitizen looks better imo
[3:08:48] Dig_Playz: But Im sure it'll get better over time. Thats the standard these days unfortunately
[3:08:57] boomerang101: starfield looks a lot like no mans sky
[3:08:57] Hpiz: Star Citizen just hit 600m+ crowdfunding
[3:09:02] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Loot is random but that's not my pet beef. My pet peeve and the biggest one is carry weight so Skyrim had carry weight system in the game where if you are encumbered you couldn't walk hardly at all or fast travel
[3:09:05] jimzyz98ttv: man today is not worth to pre order i feel like always bugs
[3:09:15] imoxyr6: Starfield used the same 20 years old engine
[3:09:29] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: It's kind of similar in starfield, but you have oxygen and by exhausting your oxygen. If you sprint or full walk then you run out your oxygen and will slowly die
[3:09:33] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Kind of dumb
[3:10:00] imoxyr6: They just open new office in Manchester
[3:10:06] Arkitek: it was like 5 years ago for me, if they got me for 30 bucks.. gg.
[3:10:13] Hpiz: I think they're prolonging it because they're most likely making more money than they would if they actually "released" the full game lol
[3:10:24] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: I will say one things with the you can board people ships and steal them like space pirates
[3:10:31] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: You can be a space pirate in starfield
[3:11:15] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Give it a few months. There's bad to be some mods created for it as well as a co-op mod
[3:11:33] Hpiz: Pretty soon the AI drivin NPCs will be more fun to experience the game with and have in your party than real people
[3:11:39] solidzzzzzzzz: @Swifty going arms ou tank?
[3:11:46] Arkitek: @Hpiz they had a whole conventiion based on it, definitely doing ok lol
