[1:44:26] OdinsArseGrease: hated comment but MoP had some banger pvp
[1:44:32] Vanguarded: You get embers each difficulty
[1:44:47] Jikkan: Baj's getting rank-1 is like the seal of approval for blizzard
[1:44:54] bobbyalsorageanxiety: baj, i got a great shoulder pump in my hotel room using a backpack with 2 laptops in it. i did 25 reps and clenched hard at the top, then did the other arm. it was burning hard quickly. more of a burn then i ever get from heavy weights.
[1:45:31] Vanguarded: Though the consensus is that doing a higher difficulty condenses the embers from previous lower difficulties
[1:45:56] Vanguarded: So you should only need to do the highewst you can. Though you can RNG embers from each boss on any difficulty
[1:46:00] simonurbnk: How did you come up with the name Bajheera
[1:46:04] Vanguarded: So imo it's worth running every difficulty each week
[1:46:22] Vanguarded: @Vanguarded yes
[1:46:27] Vanguarded: I have gotten them myself
[1:46:29] OdinsArseGrease: questing at random in MoP one of my crowning achieves is spell reflecting a chaos bolt gank for 1.7mill and one shotting the lock back
[1:46:35] Vanguarded: From gnarlroot on lfr
[1:46:42] Vanguarded: then same guy got an ember on gnarlroot
[1:46:43] scizzermetimberz: i got an ember on normal
[1:46:49] Kontrabida_TV: yeah same goes with the lego. they can drop from lfr upto heroic
[1:46:52] Vanguarded: And another boss which i didnt get an emebr on alst time
[1:47:01] Vanguarded: So im not sure if there is hidden numbers in the background
[1:47:53] Vanguarded: People generally have the idea that if you were to drop an ember on the same boss each run. getting the normal ember would also include the luck bonus from the lfr ember, and it combines them. But since luck values are not displayed hard to confirm
[1:48:06] Vanguarded: It is hard to confirm*
[1:48:09] bobbyalsorageanxiety: @Vanguarded how about a light load with high reps to get a pump, and then slowly increase the light load like a pound a week or so.
[1:48:26] Vanguarded: @bobbyalsorageanxiety hmmmm?
