[1:12:33] Vendralos: All that extra space might get wasted though if you don't fill the building with customers right?
[1:12:49] Shoalpatrol: you making the games free and ppl just by day/week or monthly bands would also help track what they play - in the arcade
[1:13:14] thenuttybavarian: When did you start collecting the arcade machines, Swifty?
[1:13:42] Gilbara: how would you stream from the arcade when you are not allowed to reveal your location on Twitch? (or am I wrong about that)
[1:13:47] Sqwabbles: small businesses take a beating with inflation
[1:13:55] Vendralos: People probably not spending as much money on luxuries like that, unfortunately
[1:13:59] gdub1177: Commercial is about to crash. Lots of opportunities.  A bunch of adjustable rate debt I'd about to come due
[1:14:15] GoreScum: You cant stream there wahhh?
[1:14:43] rokath1803: You can at least have computers where people can game
[1:14:45] GoreScum: I watch someone here on twitch that owns a car tuning shop, maybe certain places dont allow it I guess
[1:15:29] Gilbara: Maybe you could stream from inside without revealing the address?
[1:15:41] kakano_: porque no puede stremear desde el arcade?
[1:15:53] GoreScum: Thats what I was thinking, since I see others do that here on Twitch at their businesses @Gilbara
[1:15:59] ZHEJ: @kakano_ porque stream snipers
[1:16:00] nashonatorrr: can't you just build a relationship with the police, and they will call you if someone tries to SWAT
[1:16:31] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso go.corsair.com/XYOjza

[1:18:22] Pepski__: How many pizzas we talking
[1:18:24] Philzert: Not inIreland::)
[1:18:26] MrQuicksilver22: Most delivers prefer that because they get more tips from cash
[1:18:28] Vendralos: They should stop allowing that. Require payment up front
[1:18:47] Gilbara: @newkingcody what is cash? gachiGASM
[1:18:48] worldpain420: they did that to swifty on justtv back in the day all the pizza
[1:18:52] WingZero2517: @Vendralos MANY delivery businesses would go under
[1:18:57] GoreScum: Cash still rules where I live
[1:19:01] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:19:02] Vendralos: @Vendralos Yeah, less tips I suppose
[1:19:02] GoreScum: Couldnt see that happening
[1:19:09] ATVelkhana: its like that time when you all played skyrim back then swifty LUL but this time its just in space
[1:19:20] Pepski__: Im manager at a pizza place we accept cash at the door
[1:19:23] twentydevils: wow good ol justin tv, there's a website addy i haven't seen for a long long time lol
[1:19:29] WingZero2517: Cash is king. Debit/Credit is just a convenience
[1:19:41] ATVelkhana: game is out
[1:19:45] Vendralos: It's out
[1:19:52] PazokiTV: It’s out

[1:21:01] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[1:21:06] WingZero2517: Newer places, yes. But its an ongoing thing. For example, Hong Kong is trying to be cashless by 2024
[1:21:27] WingZero2517: They're still working out the kinks on how to do it properly
[1:21:41] Gilbara: yes
[1:21:42] GoreScum: Yeah they are going in the direction where it will be second. Here in Canada that wont happen
[1:22:09] jasonbriggs: stantford conneticut
[1:22:26] GoreScum: Oh like old abandoned malls?
[1:22:33] Risarrx: Online shopping killed malls
[1:22:33] LegendCG1: Hey swifty, are you in arcade yet?

[1:23:07] Vendralos: A lot of it, yeah
[1:23:08] GoreScum: Yeah, can buy so many things online
[1:23:09] WingZero2517: I carry emergency cash, but the only thing I really use cash for anymore is a haircut lol
[1:23:24] zoootty: covid and amazon really killed a lot of smaller businesses
[1:23:31] GoreScum: My malls have been dead since I was in middle school, so around 2011
[1:23:33] GoreScum: Way before COVID
[1:24:01] zoootty: true, mall here only has a theater, nail shops, and a gamestop
[1:24:09] Gilbara: is Florida an expensive state compared to the others?
[1:24:10] zoootty: everything left in the past 10 years
[1:24:11] awsync: what will you use commercial space for?
[1:24:29] viirracocha: covid was nail in the coffin for many bussines, since many vere froced to adapt to home delivery only
[1:24:48] Cyclonekermit: hoa dues?
[1:25:00] GoreScum: According to google, malls started dieing as early as 2006
[1:25:13] rokath1803: Cdd?

[8:01:25] tx_sanchez830: what addon is that making the quest talk?
[8:01:32] raftdodger: Yeah actual DKP was fun and built great guilds. But people had to learn to not be salty. Some lootninjas became known in realms and people would be boycotting their BoE postings on the AH. I swear people were fanatical about the game integrity and it was so fun to have everyone getting srs
[8:01:40] GoreScum: I preferred Cata over Wrath for Arena

[8:05:49] raftdodger: @leocinno I remember seeing like a level 15 gnome mage who probably had just gotten hit by a level 19 in WSG with Shadowfang ... he got popped and it was the funniest thing in the sight of 100+ Horde crashing down the gates and just laying waste to SW .

[9:18:13] Lotsovkhaos: @Swifty I often get 2+ min ad breaks from you compared to others like Esfand that's only 15 seconds. Do you just have them all play at once so it's less breaks?
[9:18:48] Spart4nm4n: @Lotsovkhaos you could sub or get twitch prime for a free sub to your favorite twitch streamers each month
[9:18:55] d0lk: If you need to speed up weapon levels, use a scroll of Intellect
[9:19:01] Spart4nm4n: #amazon prime
