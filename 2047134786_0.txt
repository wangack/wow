[0:28:50] saund: we're pushing back an alli group atm

[0:30:43] toter_s: @Hydramist hey man u remember what best 2s comps were in cata?
[0:31:31] saund: i think i value 1.20 speed wand and trinket the most bringing into p2
[0:31:38] saund: is that correct?
[0:31:50] saund: pvp
[0:32:13] saund: right, im happy i got it before phase ends
[0:32:19] saund: so i dont have to do BFD at 40
[0:32:54] saund: yea only thing im missing from BIS atm is tier chest and better gloves
[0:32:58] TheFitzzTV: "sod priest pvp" where is the pvp?
[0:33:23] saund: @TheFitzzTV blame blizzard LuL
[0:33:37] TheFitzzTV: running around, looking for mobs without more than two abilities
[0:33:57] TheFitzzTV: i mean, nothing against u bro, best priest eu wotlk, but sod is shiet
[0:33:58] 9ntice: "PVP Event in Ashenvale, based on Alterac Valley"   We knew it'd be shit
[0:34:17] saund: im still scared to go zoram on horde
[0:34:18] TheFitzzTV: it ruined wotlk
[0:34:21] saund: with that fucking civi so close
[0:34:49] TheFitzzTV: warmane > wotlk classic
[0:35:25] toter_s: will you play cata?
[0:35:31] TheFitzzTV: 99% one sided servers, dead world, gdkp (cant emphasize gdkp more), raid logging or arena que
[0:35:51] prodigy_wow: I really enjoy wow without an arena number associated to everyone
[0:36:02] prodigy_wow: people see that number and instantly either adore you or think youre useless
[0:36:05] TheFitzzTV: i forgot the bots
[0:36:16] saund: then you have yourself, hosting community pvp nights, night and day <3
[0:36:25] saund: we appreciate you in the wow pvp community Ryan
[0:36:49] TheFitzzTV: true, there are cheaters on warmane, but tbh they are banned there quite frequently which is the oposite of classic, blizz doesnt care
[0:37:10] bokogodx: as far as i remember u were playing on arena tournament quite a while
[0:37:11] DISLIKEABLEFULLCAPSNAME: gdkps are taking over though
[0:37:21] bokogodx: how come u dont like s8
[0:37:25] TheFitzzTV: @dislikeablefullcapsname where?
[0:38:08] bokogodx: u had a priest in wrath named Sauter :P i remember

[0:41:28] pikkuvasikka: Imagine the SoD duel tournaments, if the meta is not figured out yet
[0:41:29] furioss2: is gearing hard atm ?
[0:41:52] furioss2: <3 <3
[0:42:27] 9ntice: how u dealing with the ping? started leveling on NA too feels odd to play on 140+ ms
[0:43:02] 9ntice: wow 100 is not bad ye
[0:43:22] saund: you satisfied with boomies gear going into 40 atm?
[0:44:05] furioss2: SoD looks rly fun tho
[0:44:11] 9ntice: u'll get bored of boomie real quick tbh
[0:44:18] 9ntice: everything dying in 3 globals isnt fun
[0:44:28] cloaks: do you think we will get a similar event for AB?
[0:44:42] cloaks: rep event, ashenvale
[0:45:16] cloaks: ye but I heard it was some new faction connected to STV, or well "leaks" I saw
[0:45:41] cloaks: ye ur prolly right
[0:46:05] 9ntice: i mean u'll probably level in arathi for a bit anyway
[0:46:11] fiskensfriend: i think it will be turn ins perhaps. Kill ppl>loot>turn in. First to reach a certain amount wins
[0:46:13] 9ntice: only things we know are about STV but im sure theres a bunch more
[0:46:13] fiskensfriend: perhaps

[0:49:00] stilfor: its so sad the servers cant handle big fights, the experience of world pvp could be so different than it is
[0:49:06] Bodhisage: Can't "loot" other players while in a raid?
[0:49:27] fiskensfriend: would had to be pick ups perhaps? Like imagine nodes all across STV or something. With equal spread forcing the pop to different areas.

[0:51:36] demongodxtv: wonder why they havent introduced arena with classic+ i thought alot of people would be for this but maybe im wrong? @Hydramist
[0:51:57] prodigy_wow: tinkywinky, report that name LUL
[0:52:23] yakoremoob: they said they dont want competitive pvp
[0:52:56] Hanshenkjes: We are also not hearing music btw
[0:53:54] garmok1979: is tjis NA server?
[0:54:48] demongodxtv: why do they need to balance it? i mean i have fond memories of vanilla but pvp balance certainly wasnt what i remember xD @Hydramist
[0:55:07] yakoremoob: if they dont lock gear behind competitive pvp and its just for fun, then they can worry less about how balanced it is
[0:55:10] nailerak: hey Hydra, do you have any tips on improving field awarene!stop
[0:55:59] Bodhisage: People would actually watch SoD AWC
[0:56:30] garmok1979: there are ways to balance PvP without affecting PvE, but it ain't always easy. Maybe they're worried about the clusterfuck that is tweaking PvP numbers for classes without throwing off their groove in PvE
[0:56:42] nailerak: hey Hydra, do you have any tips on improving field awareness for noob PvP players? (like say, an addon that shows dispellable stuff by your toon, etc. - something that works better before you have the chance to learn every spell / affliction in the game)
[0:56:44] jabzouxxx: what saddens me as well is that they abandoned wotlk arena xD just a few tuned numbers it would be so pog
[0:57:05] garmok1979: yeah
[0:58:41] garmok1979: that's true, I didn't realize there's no touching the fundamentals of classic
[1:01:41] ephixa_fan: hi

[2:17:55] perseay797: Just please no more starsurge-like bullshit :D
[2:18:34] varatupaj: just give it mana cost
[2:18:37] Dancheek: SS is so stupid... lava burst costs 50mana, 2sec cast time, does less dmg lol
[2:18:39] varatupaj: simple solution
[2:18:40] Skry667: yea not 6 mana
[2:18:41] perseay797: Or longer cooldown
[2:18:46] Dancheek: it just rewards low skill gameplay
[2:18:53] Dancheek: and I am a druid main
[2:18:58] rns_aurelius: i hate star surge as a druid it feels like the only button with any value
[2:19:04] wheeezyp: compared to death were you take dmg if its not the death dealing hit
[2:19:05] prodigy_wow: i got the plains ring for 45g
[2:19:15] varatupaj: @Dancheek same with chaos bolt for warlock
[2:19:24] Dancheek: yea CB hits like a wet noodle in pvp
[2:19:33] prodigy_wow: one on the AH
[2:19:49] prodigy_wow: sweet talked him in whispers
[2:20:23] stilfor: and its not 42 yards lol
[2:20:28] Dancheek: it's just a lazy way to make druid good... they have horrible mana problems and do no burst so they give them one spell instead of giving a passive that helps their dmg/mana
[2:20:48] Extramediums: starsurge, wrath being free wtih rune, etc
[2:21:00] perseay797: @Dancheek wdym they solved boomking mana entirely
[2:21:24] Tappsters: what is the flightpath counter? Is that InFlight?
[2:21:35] cyanne112: the only place you use wrath is in pve atm, and you will stop using it at 40 anywya
[2:21:48] Locky987: Blizzard and plans LUL
[2:21:53] Dancheek: @perseay797 ya but without SS druid still has no burst or good damage... like hydra said its one rune holding up the whole class right now
[2:22:18] cyanne112: maybe in a premade, i would rather go with SotF when solo
[2:22:41] perseay797: @perseay797 For pve they still very subpar on dmg, but their mana is infinite basically. It's very hard to go oom as boomkin.
[2:22:43] stilfor: dw it will stun ppl next phase too
[2:22:49] Dancheek: just make fury of stormrage chance to make instant starfire, ez
[2:23:05] cyanne112: starsurge and starfire should do about the same dmg, is that we have a lvl20 starfire artm
[2:23:31] hoaxxes: Hope they change the range on it

[2:51:30] perseay797: HPM basically comes down to  highest rank has most value per mana. The reason you downrank is you don't always need to cast the chunkiest and most expensive heal

[2:56:37] Sinostra: pvp specs also depend on your faction, don't they ?
[2:57:07] Seriumosa: Why not Martyrdom over imp Fortitude?
[2:57:38] perseay797: Is spirit worth it for priest in pve  in phase 1? I've been told by many "hardcore" frogs that it's basically useless and you don't need much int too, just max your spell power with greens LUL
[2:57:38] Seriumosa: A BG one I think
[2:58:53] Extramediums: @Hydramist What's your opinion on Arcane mage healing?
[2:59:24] perseay797: Is that your kid? :)

[3:06:15] perseay797: What's binary spells? Spells that are aither full resists or full hits?
[3:06:48] rns_aurelius: @perseay797 things like fear/polymorph it either hits or doesnt you cant get partial resist
[3:10:40] tonyferalmovies: yoo

[3:14:30] shmokes_: i started playing priest because of you and im having a blast
[3:17:29] Sinostra: you might not need to include spellpen, because it's not officially a stat in vanilla
[3:19:38] Sinostra: yeah, but it's explicitly stated what is does
[3:19:45] Sinostra: it's not a stat
[3:23:34] Sinostra: yeah
[3:24:31] googlewooglex: What is binary & non-binary, I think for non native eng ppl it could be good to make that clear?

[3:29:24] Deftvx: hows SoD been? hyped for 40 phase?
[3:30:08] kasjuss: how much honor should i farm to ensure pvp trinket?
[3:31:23] Kulture1: trinket is 15 hks
[3:31:24] tcl16: 15 hks
[3:31:41] Kulture1: sgt from rank 0 is 11500 honor i believe
[3:31:52] Kulture1: sgt from rank2 is 4500 honor
[3:32:04] prodigy_wow: Int is very good on priest since it allows you to press dispel magic more
[3:32:13] prodigy_wow: before needing to drink
[3:32:14] Sinostra: Yeah, but that might throw people off
[3:32:46] Sinostra: wouln't it be a good thing to add thatt to your guide ?
[3:32:47] Sinostra: as a note
[3:33:18] Sinostra: simply state that misses are always displayed as resists by the game
[3:34:04] Sinostra: it did throw me off when we were testing
[3:34:26] slarenoff: remove the which in the although spell penetration which part
[3:41:55] Sinostra: Did you define a heartbeat in the guide ?
[3:41:57] Sinostra: oh
[3:42:37] Sinostra: Yeah, but it's important for priests, and this is a priest guide

[5:08:53] ama__deus: customer service

[7:51:15] Studiovirtanen: ye
[7:51:42] Studiovirtanen: Didnt they lay off a lot of people now aswell?
[7:52:02] oddfud: blizz massivly shit in our face
[7:52:06] Studiovirtanen: :(
[7:52:15] Studiovirtanen: true
[7:52:16] alexbilbaoo: I though,okay since im getting vs premade all the time,i definitely need to join a premade. Suddenly,after losing the first fight,the " let em win" kicks in peepoLeave
[7:52:28] Goated_Goods: meanwhile profit is through the roof
[7:52:45] walcolive: if they thought they would benefit of making these changes, obviously they would. But due to them not investing into it they prob think its not worht it
[7:52:50] walcolive: they are prob not so stupid
[7:53:08] alexbilbaoo: So i realize ppl jsut want rep as fast as possible,the pvp is in a second place. Kinda sad
[7:53:56] 9ntice: WSG first, everything else second for me
[7:55:43] oddfud: @alexbilbaoo true, the pve andys with massive industrial efficiency ideology in bg xd
[7:57:08] walcolive: they most likley think it wont bring more players long term. Its just spending money for few to enjoy the game a bit more
[7:57:17] patites_: mate it's nowhere close to 2 people to balance
[7:57:33] patites_: its like 1 person class AND and im being generous more like 1 per spec
[7:57:37] sawastream: Cuse all a company care about is quarterly earnings. And multiple phases/launches fit that
[7:57:43] alexbilbaoo: @oddfud exaclty man , i guess with rbgs we would get rid off of this type of player
[7:57:52] walcolive: @sawastream exactly, u do it for the share holders
[7:58:02] walcolive: not for some gamers to enjoy it a bit more
[7:58:11] walcolive: who already pay for the game as it is
[7:58:19] sawastream: @walcolive Exactly
[7:59:07] patites_: that's so unfair and not true sorry hydra i love your content but you are wrong
[7:59:08] Studiovirtanen: :)
[7:59:12] oddfud: @alexbilbaoo indeed
[7:59:17] patites_: its no just two people!! that's just unrealistic
[7:59:41] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: The game doesn't have to be good as long as the money keeps going up, this is how it is gonna be. Like @walcolive said, you need to satisfy the shareholders.
[7:59:55] walcolive: these two developers is probably a huge part of the procentage of the entire team, which changes the view
[8:00:06] Muted93: Do we know what new runes are coming yet?
[8:00:26] strawberryfieldsf0: !tierlist
[8:00:27] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uChRjssfuOg
[8:00:54] patites_: i literally manage 600 developers and i can garante you that two people are not enough to balance a game like wow. absolute minimum 5-7
[8:01:15] patites_: oh you mean throw ideas? ok that is fair enough
[8:01:25] patites_: im talking about implementing those ideas
[8:02:01] geniusatwrok: i think what @Hydramist says is definitely possible, however, two people with that kind of ability probably do not want to be working for some large corporate bureaucracy
[8:03:16] patites_: but what are you describing it's not even a dev. that's the job of the product owner/product manager
[8:03:26] patites_: devs have completely different responsabilities
[8:03:38] 9ntice: @patites_ spell balancing or adding is diff i suppose with SOD using legion base
[8:03:39] walcolive: why dont they hire you then? Or  send in your thoughts about it and they might change it
[8:03:39] hannoswe: they work hard only for nerfing hunters
[8:03:45] theresthisguy: by "dev" people just mean the people who are working on balance
[8:03:48] geniusatwrok: exactly, that's semantics
[8:03:57] Studiovirtanen: :D :D
[8:04:03] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: But don't you think blizzard makes the game like this with intention? I mean they have been here since 2004 and still going strong
[8:04:14] Xspazz: holinka
[8:05:16] Studiovirtanen: :D
[8:05:29] walcolive: haha hydra tilting more and more for every minute
[8:05:36] theresthisguy: best solution would be to just hire top pve'ers and top pvp'ers to playtest things periodically. i wouldnt trust blizz employees to playtest and come to good conclusions
[8:05:43] theresthisguy: bunch of morons in that company
[8:05:52] jazni_23: it all comes down to money
[8:06:09] ama__deus: @theresthisguy top-anything are rarely really decent at balance, though. They, just like most players, really just want their own classes to excel LUL
[8:06:13] tat_urfa: will this balancing make a sufficient return on investment to offset the two additional payments? lets say the dev gets 90k each which is 180k means that 1200 more people would have to sub the game monthly right
[8:06:14] kylar_tv: buff mage, nerf bomi and priest
[8:06:16] rns_aurelius: the next phase of runes needs to just be passives to buff the base kits because theyre already being overshadowed by 1 or 2 abilities
[8:06:16] geniusatwrok: @zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd totally agree, the incentives are fucked up right now
[8:06:25] walcolive: they probably have these "two guys" already, but they most likley are not in this like you are
[8:06:32] avenomxx: if SoD is not the version to go wild and make fun changes, when then?

[8:06:36] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uChRjssfuOg
[8:06:38] p1437ka: that's 300k a year that blizzard loses
[8:06:39] theresthisguy: blizz has like infinite funds. thats not an excuse. they spend millions on all kinds of shit that gets scrapped, like that game that got cancelled after ybarra left
[8:07:03] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @geniusatwrok And without investors there woulnd't even be a World of Warcraft game, so people really need to chill out thinking they know everything.
[8:07:06] rns_aurelius: @kylar_tv mage will be stronger next phase just from the talents available
[8:07:09] theresthisguy: @ama__deus surely you can find people that are levelheaded enough to put their biases aside. also thats why youd hire several people to discuss changes
[8:07:22] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: We are talking about a multi-billion dollar company, they know what they are doing. They are making this cost-efficient
[8:07:49] geniusatwrok: @tat_urfa this is common sense analysis, but it's not how things work at large public companies, where there is typically a ton of waste
[8:07:51] 9ntice: wager matches would be sick
[8:07:53] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: Balancing the game at level 25 means that they will have to RE-Balance everything at level 40 etc etc.
[8:07:54] ama__deus: Consumables shouldn't be for free in any mode, just because it encourages people to play the rest of the game if there is a cost attached
[8:08:15] gororororoo: ngl those are all pretty great idea
[8:08:33] 9ntice: Battleroyale STV would be isck
[8:08:33] alexbilbaoo: Bgs tournaments
[8:08:50] walcolive: Hydra creating a completely different game all within 2 minutes of talking
[8:08:55] walcolive: this sounds expensive
[8:09:03] bodkinz_: why private servers are just better
[8:09:48] 9ntice: attack on def mode would be hype
[8:09:54] 9ntice: good 5v5 gamemode
[8:09:57] jazni_23: need in game creator mode
[8:10:02] geniusatwrok: @walcolive i think hydra is coming at this with a large degree of freshness, which is completely missing from corporate drones
[8:10:14] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: They added solo-queue because players wanted it in retail? And know everyone complains about solo-queue
[8:10:17] theresthisguy: wow could use an icefrog
[8:10:34] walcolive: @geniusatwrok yeah ofc, i dont disagree with him. This all sounds good
[8:10:35] omawamousinda: truuuuuuuuue
[8:10:39] jazni_23: i think they dump an initial sum of money into an initial product and milk it as long as it's profiatble
[8:10:57] Fawh: ill have you know that i'm sitting next to the 8 year old who's in charge of running sod and you just made him cry
[8:11:09] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @vexile_23 Ofcourse?? You think blizzard is a charity-company?
[8:11:16] walcolive: this is what people wanted from the start, classic+ with NEW CONTENT
[8:11:18] ama__deus: The only way they'll take money into their hands is if people stop playing the game, though, so it kinda sucks that it's like that
[8:12:15] theresthisguy: even more sad cause blizz wasnt always like this
[8:12:15] nithru: multibillion dollar company cant afford to balance their cash cow
[8:12:19] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @ama__deus This applies to every single damn thing in the world lol
[8:12:28] Bojanglez: but sod is free so it doesnt make any extra money
[8:12:43] Sinostra: problem is, the decision makers don't know anything about the game
[8:12:45] Studiovirtanen: :O
[8:12:53] Sinostra: that's how it is in big companies

[8:13:03] ama__deus: @zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd I mean, most things in the world you aren't as emotionally invested in as you are in WoW LUL If 1 milk brand sucks, you just pick up another carton. MMORPGs? Slim fucking pickings.
[8:13:05] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: that's free compared to retail
[8:13:06] omawamousinda: in 2 month of p1 everyone paid them 30$
[8:13:10] Extramediums: blizzard has killed every bit of community support they've ever had in asinine fashion
[8:13:12] jookmeat: he means you don't have to buy it as an expansion. But it's still moronic to think that
[8:13:15] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: retail has to buy every expansion, and it has a store
[8:13:19] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @ama__deus Same thing, pick another MMORPG
[8:13:24] Bojanglez: sod is a side game, much like classic hardcore, and dota was. it comes with a sub for live
[8:13:35] ama__deus: @zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd as Ryan says, there is no other MMORPG that's worth
[8:13:50] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @ama__deus That is your problem, you know. Not trying to be rude
[8:13:54] Fawh: @Bojanglez dota was never run by blizzard?
[8:13:58] xdanx42: FF XIV
[8:14:00] Fawh: dafuq
[8:14:00] ama__deus: @zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd LUL ok
[8:14:08] Calamyst: Calamyst subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! !
[8:14:12] geniusatwrok: this is what happens to all large public companies once they run into "easy money" (e.g. apple taking 30% cut in their app store)
[8:14:14] Bojanglez: DOTA came from a side game, that was free in WC3
[8:14:31] lordtrashcanman: yo I still play ultima online private server because it’s good pvp
[8:14:36] dexter_delaney: yea they gotta sort the movement out on AOC
[8:14:40] Fawh: dota was a custom map in wc3, blizzard had nothing to do with it outside of creating wc3
[8:14:50] ama__deus: Lost Ark PVP was actually pretty enjoyable, but the rest of the game is trash
[8:14:53] omawamousinda: i liked your take on wotlk in s5 aswell
[8:14:55] ama__deus: well, raiding was good too.
[8:14:55] Studiovirtanen: yes
[8:15:02] Fawh: it's not remotely comparable to sod
[8:15:10] walcolive: In few years all these 1990 grown ups will get families and all this u want is soon over anyways. I dont see 16-20 year olds starting to play this game
[8:15:26] sprouts21: low-key thought New worlds combat was awesome
[8:15:36] jookmeat: all the people that play WoW already have families. Ever been to blizzcon? There's nobody under the age of 25 there
[8:15:38] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: Also i think wow is the cheapest game out there atm. The game can be "free". The first cost is literally 13$ and from there on you just have to farm enough gold for a token?
[8:15:39] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @Fawh if it wasn't for Blizzard, dota would have 0 players and it wouldn't exist in the first place
[8:15:57] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: that's why Valve had to buy it, not just steal it
[8:16:11] Fawh: @KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA that's not related to his point, it's like saying if it wasn't for electricity blizzard wouldn't exist
[8:16:17] Fawh: blizzard's involvement with dota was minimal
[8:16:33] rns_aurelius: How popular would actual competitve pvp be? There's a reason we see so many hunters and so many people re rolled druid when star surge was buffed. A lot of people like brain dead easy mode whether they can admit it or not. If BFD was remotely difficult, people wouldve been crying all phase.
[8:16:33] ama__deus: @zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd imagine playing retail enough to pay for your token. I'll rather pay € 15 LUL
[8:16:36] geniusatwrok: @Hydramist i wholeheartedly agree with lack of competition being the main issue, but another issue is that the entire system (constantly inflating fiat currencies, leading to perverse incentives) is broken right now
[8:16:42] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @ama__deus Wotlk also
[8:16:49] nithru: do you think pc will be as popular of a gaming platform in 10 ish years?
[8:16:50] walcolive: @jookmeat at some point it will break. More and more dad-gamers which doesnt have time with this competitive content Hydra's talking about
[8:16:54] unhoLynx_: dota is the best group pvp there is :) I love dota

[8:17:02] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uChRjssfuOg
[8:17:07] Bojanglez: the whoile point was, DOTA was free but you paid for WC3, much like SOD, You pay for retail and get SOD.
[8:17:37] Fawh: aye but dota was not a 'side project' for wc3
[8:17:43] Fawh: for blizzard*
[8:17:54] Bojanglez: its a side project, thats it
[8:18:02] Fawh: it's not
[8:18:05] Fawh: sod is sure
[8:18:10] omawamousinda: arena is bad because you looking for a partner 90% of the time
[8:18:23] walcolive: its FPS, u cant compare it
[8:18:34] Fawh: but when blizzard has hundreds of thousands playing sod they should acknowledge that the game requires some attention
[8:18:37] im__peanut: @Hydramist  gonna main heals or dps at 40 ?
[8:18:39] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: So what you wanna convert World of Warcraft to battle royal  haha?
[8:18:40] walcolive: no, in this game u have to invest in levels and gear etc
[8:19:17] DeltaDarce: Chat purposely misconstruing your argument
[8:19:21] unhoLynx_: MMOs are just better suited for PvE content and that’s it
[8:19:25] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: Brother wow gives you so many modes you can pick? Farming, Pvp, pve, boosting etc etc..
[8:19:28] theresthisguy: leave it to that redname to somehow misunderstand every point
[8:19:39] walcolive: @zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd farming lmao
[8:19:47] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @walcolive Some people enjoy that?
[8:19:53] Bojanglez: lots do
[8:19:54] prinziple: tbf, i dont play wow anymore to get any competitive play or outcome out of it, I play CS for that and wow to chill
[8:20:05] walcolive: @zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd so far i havent met one that enjoys farming NPCs in the world

[8:20:52] Bojanglez: thats a lie @im__peanut
[8:21:00] ama__deus: I don't liketo measure my play time in $/h LUL
[8:21:02] DeltaDarce: Original guild wars got pvp right. you could create a max level toon for pvp, it was just different cosmetically
[8:21:06] ataturk1907: whats the range addon called ?
[8:21:10] Fawh: i actually enjoyed farming in classic
[8:21:12] prokn4h: I'll send you gold if you go work for blizzard in content and balance department
[8:21:21] Fawh: think i spent a few hundred hours farming devilsaur
[8:21:22] omawamousinda: @im__peanut just leave bg? kinda deserved
[8:21:47] ama__deus: I don't feel like Classic is about that arcade life at all, though
[8:21:50] walcolive: Hydra, what other game would u be able to invest in as much as in wow (if u would quit wow that is)?
[8:21:52] im__peanut: so i get banned bcos i dont sweat as a solo q?
[8:22:01] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @walcolive There are people who enjoy different stuff. I think world of warcraft has given their players so many options from Era, wotlk, retail. I mean you can do whatever you want
[8:22:06] Extramediums: oh, you mean the ptr? :D
[8:22:07] Bojanglez: have to admit, i was a classic hater at first, but, SOD is lit af. I havent seen so much life in the world in years
[8:22:23] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @Bojanglez so you haven't played classic?
[8:22:44] Bojanglez: I played classic in 2004, but not the "reborn" one
[8:22:54] im__peanut: so u have no idea how toxic bgs is boja
[8:23:04] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: wrath prepatch and wrath launch had 30k queue it was sooo huge
[8:23:10] jgagel1: they suckered us into so many toons at 25
[8:23:26] giveawayfromnobody: it's consistent with your statement about modes that are intrinsically rewarding the reward is playing itself
[8:23:29] Fawh: im still upset living flame is locked
[8:23:36] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: But i do agree with the premade thing tho, should be like in retail max 5 in a group
[8:23:45] Bojanglez: locked to who? all?
[8:24:21] prinziple: I miss bloodline champions man
[8:24:24] prinziple: that shit was fun af
[8:24:35] unhoLynx_: Battlerite also!
[8:24:51] prinziple: yas
[8:24:54] Loomilol: how can they not fixed fucking premade meta in wsg
[8:25:11] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[8:25:17] Bojanglez: premades have been a thing for for like 20 years, they not going to change it now
[8:25:19] giveawayfromnobody: instead of farming and grinding treadmill shit just so you can do endgame, that's where RMT and bots thrive,, its 2024 there are bots that can write bots now
[8:25:20] DeltaDarce: But they can both exist at the same time. There's no reason that you cant have your normal toon that you pve on, and a pvp-locked toon
[8:25:25] Saynay: balance means losing class identity
[8:25:27] DeltaDarce: You are right tho, the model has changed
[8:25:30] fourkgaming: battlerite was B I S
[8:25:36] fourkgaming: Check badge
[8:26:06] bmkJR: have you seen the blue post about the marks? they're saying that the marks will be purged on the 7th not 6th
[8:26:09] patites_: i dont disagree with you i only said that the "business case" you are presenting is not realistic. ofc i want the best for the game but i also know how development works and how touch one thing makes a whole cascade of events follow apart right after
[8:26:39] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @patites_ This is true, im a former server hoster with 1k players/day.
[8:26:42] vrsswow: Elon Musk pls buy Blizzard make this company great again :)
[8:26:55] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @patites_ Was trying to satisfy everyone in the beginning and it backfired.
[8:26:56] walcolive: what are u doing playing thís horrible wsg game after game and just afking?
[8:27:09] Bojanglez: i wonder if sod has more players than retail
[8:27:22] feodred10: what classes / specs do you THINK will be really good in P2?
[8:27:39] ama__deus: Poll was something like 50% retail, 41% SOD, but that was right at SOD launch
[8:27:39] Sinostra: maybe at 60
[8:27:51] geniusatwrok: geniusatwrok gifted a Tier 1 sub to vrsswow! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[8:27:59] walcolive: alright
[8:28:13] flugrman: @hydramist is there a world the epic staff remains bis next phase ?
[8:28:24] 9ntice: no connects with vampire clan?
[8:28:57] vrsswow: @geniusatwrok Thanks for the gift sub!
[8:29:03] walcolive: its a new meta, u just dont understand it yet
[8:29:13] Galnagokarten: Ashenvale gives rep to revered
[8:29:23] geniusatwrok: @vrsswow yw, twitch chat is great because you can upvote people with money 😀
[8:29:25] giveawayfromnobody: even plats don't know how to front to back properly in league even with perfect ffront to back comp
[8:29:30] ama__deus: Farming rep in WSG games like that is soul crushing LUL
[8:29:44] Loomilol: premade also have better setups usually because they are pre-made :)
[8:29:57] Loomilol: and select people with gear as well
[8:29:59] KungKotz: easy solution, if queueing < 5, its like usual, if queuing > 5 you get matched with another > 5 premade
[8:30:23] nithru: sometimes I just take flag vs premades and kite around their base til my team wakes up, worked a bunch of time to cap on prems, not very effiecient if you're farming wins though
[8:30:44] keppiexoxo: !tierlist
[8:30:44] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uChRjssfuOg
[8:30:49] ama__deus: I feel like the entire "focus healer" credo completely destroys people's concept of front to back NotLikeThis Like warriors just charging their healers, out ranging your own heals
[8:30:52] KungKotz: or 2x 5
[8:30:55] khalied_22: Sadly, Premades makes the q faster
[8:31:05] Bojanglez: just disable group ques, so everybody is randy
[8:31:17] Zachaos_: M
[8:31:40] Fawh: gimmee rbgss
[8:31:41] Bojanglez: this has been the arguement from pvp inception
[8:31:42] Peeb__: coyg
[8:31:51] Saynay: why is it such a problem to make premade vs premade its already like this in wotlk
[8:32:13] Bojanglez: 5mans will do the same thing
[8:32:37] ama__deus: Anything is too much effort if you want it for free and that seems Blizzard's budgeting for Classic LULK
[8:32:41] Fawh: that sounds fine as well tbh
[8:32:42] Extramediums: @Hydramist 100% the solution
[8:32:49] Fawh: 5*2 v 5*2 sounds lit
[8:32:51] zxcmasmdawkemkalwmd: @Saynay Could be many reasons, maybe they are prioritizing phase 2-4?
[8:33:14] LoobGaming: hell yea still going mate!? was listening all day at work
[8:33:31] Extramediums: premade queue of only 5 mans, no less, no more
[8:33:54] ama__deus: Hot take, but I actually like longer queues, because it allows me to take a breather and do other stuff in the game without having to stop queueing
[8:33:56] Bojanglez: I think 3mans should be the cap
[8:34:19] Bojanglez: cause whohas more than 2 firends, amirite?
[8:34:47] Peeb__: i thought that was you mate. i was in that crap ally trademade last game. wanted a nice match
[8:35:06] ama__deus: Haven't heard "trademade" yet, but it's spot on LUL
[8:35:26] flugrman: @hydramist you think it’s possible staff remains bud next phase ?
[8:35:31] flugrman: bis
[8:35:35] Peeb__: yeah slap 10 randies together and hop in a disc call lol
[8:35:36] Sinostra: don't forget to go to ashenvale after this game
[8:35:56] Bojanglez: nothing is more toxic thasn 10 randys in discord doing pvp lol
[8:36:19] bmkJR: some are
[8:36:22] Bojanglez: hell na, trade chat groups. they spam all day

[8:37:28] Peeb__: my server has a pvp discord thats usually got 3 or 4 10-man calls going
[8:37:30] Sinostra: that's why you need a guild to do it with
[8:37:36] jimbonni: guildy*
[8:37:49] walcolive: the moment someone says "im too old for that shit" and nobody says anything.. then u know u're fucking old :P
[8:38:04] Bojanglez: wait what the fuck, I just noticed your nameplate disance is HELLA far wtf
[8:38:08] bmkJR: yea idk unless its for tryhard wargames i get the discord call but just to farm rep meh

[9:03:51] lHlUlLlK: do you ever go there to help?
[9:04:00] Sinostra: just because alliance actually has players that go to shredder
[9:04:50] lHlUlLlK: harder to get rep west, i blame blizzard poor design
[9:05:20] Kangaaxqt: @Hydramist  did you see my question? :)
[9:05:31] lHlUlLlK: 2 vs 3? i choose 3
[9:05:35] SeizureSloth: its literally the exact opposite on living flame NA, EVERYONE goes west, then hearths to research and we never kill glaives in middle. every single game
[9:05:45] zum_no: issue is you just need to "tag" then you can hs, that is what "kills" it.
[9:05:56] lHlUlLlK: yea unless we win
[9:05:58] jimbonni: 2 and boss bro /D
[9:07:20] zum_no: when it dies you get the rep, and you can get more kills on the "small ones" for 5-15 rep per
[9:07:36] zum_no: thats why ppl leave the bosses before they are dead

[9:14:14] MannySJ: How long is 25-40? Like 20h?
[9:14:36] Hyperioz: wand does mroe dps than any spell
[9:14:37] Fjordir1323: idk wand has zero downtime though. Its nice

[9:16:50] Fjordir1323: I thought we were talking about current phase. I must have missed the initial question
[9:16:56] Fjordir1323: wand now is better
[9:17:06] Extramediums: I found up to about 20~ I would pennance, void plague (homies are 100% uptime basically) and wand from there on, and I might take a few some damage, but nothing much
[9:17:06] Sinostra: speaking of leveling, when are you gonna level your alts ?
[9:17:06] RealLumber: wand spec early doesn't feel as lit as penance imba
