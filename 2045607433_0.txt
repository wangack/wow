[0:11:40] Calihotshot: it should at least be a recolor
[0:11:55] kuromebro: its the same wolf model they used for a bunch of wolf mounts in WoD IIRC
[0:11:58] ToxicLG: COPIUM on the street is that it's not gonna be on the trading post but part of the pandamonium time walking raid
[0:11:59] BigTrout3: they should add the warlord tricycle motorcycle as a trading post item Madge
[0:12:04] kuromebro: so there already is a ton of recolors of it
[0:12:12] Dzor12: You're so dumb @Maximum lmfao
[0:12:21] Calihotshot: or make getting the mount achievable during timewalking. Throught beating that raid on heroic.
[0:12:22] Joneim: D:
[0:12:23] Dzor12: It is Saturday tho
[0:12:25] Gromasaurus: It doesn't really matter to be honest, people generally don't pay attention to mounts the way they used to. So give everyone the mount
[0:12:25] BigTrout3: you can just buy the 2nd place version of you're alliance but god forbid you buy it on horde

[0:17:49] honeychonker: He's the "father of science fiction"
[0:17:53] MorpheenBE: can't read KEKW
[0:17:58] mastern40: the show is good but it has almost nothing to do with the book
[0:17:58] 407c: they changed a ton of shit from the book, you have to realise the book that would make a terrible show.
[0:18:17] ForgottenTime: your not illiterate your just attention span challenged KEKW
[0:18:19] friday_exe: I am utterly dissapointed in true detective 4, nothing can beat s1
[0:18:19] cfair: Lee pace yo

[0:18:45] rayraycuzzo: true detective s1 bis
[0:18:45] 407c: lee pace as day was amazing
[0:18:45] user_name_null: silo books way better than the show, but the show still slaps

[0:19:44] ChicknPikle: ChicknPikle subscribed with Prime. 
[0:19:49] Deyoe: @Maximum You've been hyped about Foundation for like a week now. Can I assume you've watched Expanse?
[0:19:51] 407c: the books are different, but both are amazing
[0:19:56] honeychonker: The books are VERY good to be fair
[0:19:58] Faschius: i read the books, its just different. The books arent really like a character based story
[0:20:07] SligoYanks: i read the books, was not a huge fan of season 1, but season 2 was fantastic
[0:20:09] GymClassHero72: @learningtogrowtogether Peaky Fookin Blinders
[0:20:09] 407c: foundation season 2 was even better
[0:20:15] TheKrazyPineaholic: Season 1 BANGED
[0:20:17] wreckedgum: im talking about True detective s4, its only started. Comared to true detective season 1
[0:20:20] lightbringercl: foundation from Apple TV was good aye- need to watch season 2 still
[0:20:27] miceinmyveins: Silo is based off books also but that show slaps
[0:20:30] lightbringercl: severance 🤤
[0:20:33] samathi21: i liked s1 more
[0:20:38] Deyoe: Yo can they hurry the fuck up with S2 of Severance?
[0:20:40] littlegooaatt: severance s2 when
[0:20:54] wkGG67: foundation cancelled before s3 cap mme
[0:20:56] lightbringercl: yeah I need severance season 2
[0:21:15] pseudo75: LUL
[0:21:17] Deyoe: 100%
[0:21:19] wreckedgum: im the same bro, i like the idea of reading. but I cant read book after book
[0:21:21] honeychonker: It's because when they read books they have an idea in their head
[0:21:28] Joneim: Loud minority andies
[0:21:30] KraigLooney: it's because we build the worlds in our heads, and it very rarely matches the visual interpretation of someone else.
[0:21:38] Cakerinotv: wheel of time series is absolute trash, they really just like fucked the entire series
[0:21:39] arctic7house: I just don't watch shows or movies
[0:21:59] goblingher: The biggest thing for me  is when movies cut certain parts of books I love.
[0:22:01] honeychonker: Can we all agree Wheel of Time was fucking dogshit regardless of whether you read the books or not though
[0:22:10] Felovar: I love reading, but I think it's only because the things that I like reading haven't been made into shows or movies yet. I would prob choose to watch it over read
[0:22:13] Cakerinotv: yeah its so bad
[0:22:14] wreckedgum: @Cakerinotv even having not read the books, season 1 was complete trash
[0:22:15] whitemoose22: I might need to pick foundation season 2 up again, because s2 was real bad in the first couple episodes it lost me real quick
[0:22:15] wreckedgum: yes
[0:22:19] kullkhan: The problem is book readers have to big of an issue with understanding it letting go that no book ever can be made word for word or scene for scene and be good.  The mediums are just too different.
[0:22:21] 407c: its about time thats on a wheel
[0:22:22] Camelbak21: Amazon garbage show
[0:22:26] SligoYanks: as someone who read the foundation books...it was 100% clear going into the series was that there was no way the tv show could ever be like the books
[0:22:26] wreckedgum: its fucking garbage
[0:22:26] hyeheal: wheel of time was mid
[0:22:28] Felovar: season wasn't as bad as season 1
[0:22:33] Cakerinotv: im so mad they fucked it up
[0:22:36] honeychonker: A beloved fantasy series that took 30 years to finish, the TV adaptation was fucking awful @Maximum
[0:22:40] Dreclador: wheel of time book series is good
[0:22:41] wreckedgum: rosmund pike
[0:22:45] Calihotshot: Reacher, Terminal List are Amzons best shows
[0:22:45] ctg_dreamz: As a book reader I watched 5 minutes of WoT and shut that shit right off lmao
[0:22:47] kullkhan: Wheel of time season two is good.
[0:22:50] lightbringercl: oh god the books gripped me when I was growing up
[0:22:53] ursinealli: the changes they made to WoT just don’t make sense
[0:22:55] Dreclador: tv show is very different but still good imo
[0:22:56] goblingher: @Cakerinotv how much did they tug on braids
[0:23:00] Lodvar: The WOT show is ....not very good. Books are great.
[0:23:08] MorpheenBE: max can't read CAUGHT
[0:23:10] Deyoe: @Maximum It came out around the time of Rings of Power, got overshadowed. Probably for good reason
[0:23:12] wreckedgum: LOTR slaps
[0:23:13] samathi21: The expanse was the best sci-fi tv show i have watched recently
[0:23:14] Sover31gn: maximumDC
[0:23:15] lightbringercl: the books were top. so much exposition tho
[0:23:19] friday_exe: lotr movies >>> books
[0:23:20] danksly: yo i can imagine a dragon but its not gonna compare to the best animators on the planet drawing a dragon
[0:23:24] Cakerinotv: yeah lotr movies slap
[0:23:24] kuromebro: isn't a huge part of Wheel of time that men can't use magic most of the time and the series completely forgets that?
[0:23:24] wkGG67: he's gonna say he likes ROP
[0:23:27] infektyd: as a show, its pretty entertaining
[0:23:37] infektyd: i liked it, could careless about the lore
[0:23:38] Mei_tricks: rings of power was dog water
[0:23:40] wreckedgum: lol true
[0:23:51] Lodvar: ROP was shite.
[0:23:52] atamdev: nah that show was bad
[0:23:52] Calihotshot: Rings of Power was a good show, if you go into in not expecting Peter Jackons type of movie. @Maximum
[0:24:00] emergingraid: Dude Andor was so good
[0:24:01] Deyoe: @Maximum Its been a year. Talk spoilers lol
[0:24:02] mangotangodown66: how could you make somehting so bad with 1B. embarrising
[0:24:05] Fernite95: See I am a book reader, crazy book reader but I just accept that tv shows are like fanfictions of the IP I love and I get to enjoy both of them.
[0:24:08] 407c: the expanse is another good scifi book to show transition.
[0:24:10] friday_exe: I enjoyed RoP ,but thats me I guess
[0:24:15] Tamex26: succession was good
[0:24:20] danksly: dialogue fix the fkn dialogue its dope
[0:24:25] shawkeem: what show? foundations?
[0:24:26] humptydumptiy: What about Live action One Piece
[0:24:31] Cakerinotv: i didnt mind rop, it was fine
[0:24:33] Faschius: its not even based off a book, its based off the appendixes.
[0:24:35] mangotangodown66: think there is a lot of critique without reading the book
[0:24:44] SligoYanks: the source material for Rings of Power being mostly the Silmarillion meant it could never be like the books on tv, which is just fine
[0:24:46] Felovar: they did completely change the lore with the shows though
[0:24:47] Mei_tricks: you could ignore all lore from lotr and that series is still awful
[0:24:55] friday_exe: august
[0:24:55] Lodvar: Foundation is not too bad. But it has very little to do with the actual books.
[0:24:58] AElated: Hello
[0:24:59] Calihotshot: they are making alot of changes to Rings of Power, they fired alot of the staff frome seaon 1
[0:25:00] Rhoncer: august apparently
[0:25:04] Dante20404: that show is garbo though
[0:25:04] Fernite95: Oooooo house of the dragon was soooooo goood
[0:25:05] leubinator: ppl are just tired of yet another lame spinoff
[0:25:07] mangotangodown66: hotd was so bood
[0:25:24] Calihotshot: theres a Dune show coming out too
[0:25:24] friday_exe: hotd > got s8 any time
[0:25:32] Cakerinotv: im also sad they kinda just shit on the material for the witcher, though I dont actually think the show itself is that bad
[0:25:34] lightbringercl: legend of Zelda tv series when
[0:25:38] lightbringercl: 🥸
[0:25:43] KaisenSiru: Podcasts Pog
[0:25:57] Lodvar: Foundation needed to be adapted. Im not too mad about it.
[0:25:58] 407c: @lightbringercl it exists, but movie next.
[0:26:02] Calihotshot: Last of Us show was trash
[0:26:05] AngryStapler: witcher source material is so good. directors think they know better than the actual creator
[0:26:11] jondbr: TLOU podcast was amazing
[0:26:30] mezzery_: foundation is such a good show. The books would be impossible to adapt exactly
[0:26:44] Lodvar: S2 of the Witcher was really bad. Didn't even bother with S3. S1 was quite good.
[0:26:45] AngryStapler: foundation is impossible to adapt. it covers like thousands of years lol
[0:26:52] Cakerinotv: the expanse owns aslo
[0:27:00] Lodvar: @mezzery_ Yeah. Agreed.
[0:27:02] jondbr: chernobyl
[0:27:07] MorpheenBE: banger series
[0:27:08] pseudo75: Pog chernobyl so good
[0:27:08] 407c: the expanse was a great adaptation
[0:27:09] AngryStapler: expanse series so great. was really really close to the books too
[0:27:09] Dzor12: It was amazing
[0:27:10] RoboMaximillion: lit series
[0:27:12] xxMaverick: chernobyl is insane
[0:27:14] MuffinVsMuffin: that show was so good
[0:27:15] therencren: Chernobyl was the reason they took away the spurs in Last of Us
[0:27:19] Theroyalmarriner: agreed
[0:27:19] Oracle_WoW: Three Body Problem is gonna slap hard.
[0:27:20] kuromebro: oh the fiction series that lies
[0:27:25] RoboMaximillion: same I trust him
[0:27:34] mezzery_: the nature of books is you get such a distinct POV to characters that just doesn't work in other mediums. TV and movies have to explain things is a much different way than just some inner monologue in a book
[0:27:36] Dreclador: that is how I feel about the wheel of time tv show @maximum. it’s super different but I can come up with decent reasons for the changes
[0:27:36] rosca89: IASP podcast is insane
[0:27:36] 407c: i am excited for three body problem
[0:27:38] RoboMaximillion: he respects the source material
[0:27:42] user_name_null: chernobyl > true detective s1
[0:27:45] honeychonker: I didn't like how they treated radiation poisoning like some infectious disease, quite a lot of scientific inaccuracies in chernobyl
[0:27:48] xxoutkastedxx: Certain scenes just dont translate the same.  Think about Harry Potter flying envelopes.  5 seconds of video vs 2 pages or so in the book talking about them.
[0:27:59] Calihotshot: when does Three body Problem come out?
[0:27:59] danksly: i never read fiction so gotta listen too or watch a yarn
[0:28:06] lightbringercl: Chernobyl- not great, not terrible
[0:28:50] mezzery_: season 2 already out, spoilers allowed for season 1 lol
[0:28:57] 407c: there were a number of changes which made the show better
[0:29:02] xxMaverick: @honeychonker you understand how much radiation that was right?
[0:29:06] honeychonker: @maximum Ready Player One is a good example - they did more visual shite in the film vs the book
[0:29:10] wkGG67: the emperors was such a dope addition compared to the book in foundation
[0:29:17] Camelbak21: It's also on a streaming service not many are using so
[0:29:25] mezzery_: yeah but think about all the shit that happens on the way to the end of GoT
[0:29:35] mezzery_: so much good stuff even if the end is spoiled
[0:29:40] xxoutkastedxx: I just beleive no matter how much a creator/director tries they cant always make it the same as the book because a lot of it is up to the readers imagination on how things look and feel etc
[0:29:46] SkunkTruck: please dont spoil. I started watching earlier this week on max's recommendation, and am only half way through s1
[0:30:02] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:30:02] honeychonker: @xxmaverick yeah but you can't "catch' radiation from someone to the point you have to completely isolate them behind screens.
[0:30:08] w1ndfeld: I have a mate who wanted to join the GoT talk and then watched the last season only LUL
[0:30:19] Lodvar: Personally, I want some of Peter F Hamiltons works to be made into a tv show. My favorite SF author.
[0:30:21] aralta_: If you want a book series where the TV matches it very closely, the expanse
[0:30:30] xxoutkastedxx: The books are almost always better right
[0:30:36] periperus: Hey so what happened with d4? One Day and out? d4bad or?

[0:30:47] Cakerinotv: its true but also there are limits to that, like I'm ok with differences in adaptation but like completely shiting on ur source material is a different thing
[0:30:48] monkhealsyo: o
[0:30:53] Fernite95: Ooof PF Hamilton would be hard to adapt they are so huge!
[0:30:55] TBouse: do people actually follow particular movie critics long term lol
[0:30:56] citywalk37: Hi Max! Please stay online and stream for the next 4 hours so I get the blue campfire toy! Thanks, xoxo <3
[0:31:12] honeychonker: The Orville is a good example, critics hated it, fans loved it. Complete opposite for Star Trek Discovery
[0:31:29] Lodvar: I wonder if they will pick up the Expanse again. Pick up the action after the (spoilers) time-jump.
[0:31:39] ssj_lenin: film criticism isnt even that sick when its just wielded for the purposes of recommendation
[0:32:09] Lodvar: ST Discovery was so bad. Fell totally apart in S2.
[0:32:13] AngryStapler: @Lodvar all of the expanse source material was covered besides like 1.5 books. picking it up would be inventing new material
[0:32:15] Blanketboi: can we fly around on a dragon?

[0:32:58] OG_Kawngi: NOPERS
[0:33:00] SligoYanks: to me it entirely depends on the source material...some books just can't work as a TV series if you kept them as is...foundation was one of those...going in i knew it could never be like the books and that was fine
[0:33:07] mezzery_: @RyanC slow horses is so fuckin good

[0:43:54] SirPikajew: Can I get confirmation that it is Saturday?
[0:43:56] mezzery_: lets get some reacts to "The real god comp"
[0:43:57] sheeeeszh: I came to learn more about The London Underground 2024 Stock, known as the New Tube for London (NTfL) during development and where it's going
[0:44:08] Fernite95: Warcraft logs would be interesting because like I dont think I use it to its full extent
[0:44:10] sukoWoW: "people so mad" = engagement = good
[0:44:31] nuka73: frost dk example been since legion
[0:44:32] Slay4daysKappa: Monk without speed taunt FeelsBadMan  @Maximum and no shot you can afford the one point
[0:44:39] nuka73: bad
[0:44:48] hamweaver: Raid comp construction 11.0 wishlist
[0:44:54] GodKingMuninn: I like having diversity in my talents, but hate when all of the choice is at the bottom
[0:44:57] Cyony: excuse me sir, but it is infact sunday
[0:45:04] Facinelli: great movie
[0:45:04] fazulo21: fire mage does that
[0:45:05] yama_class: smells like fire mage
[0:45:07] fazulo21: with the ignites
[0:45:18] Joneim: I love the enhance spec tree, but hate that i have to spend a point on windfury
[0:45:18] hajrudinthegiant: but didnt you also argue classes that cant do it all in one cant keep up?
[0:45:33] Slapsstick: soulscar
[0:46:15] majkdragon: you shoulkd just be given a certain amount of points and spend them as you want. Not have a certain amount of points beforwe you can move around the tree
[0:46:16] Cakerinotv: no
[0:46:20] xrandomdoodx: @Maximum do you think it makes sense that some class trees have no throughput talents in them while some have many?
[0:46:21] TimNanook: i don't think so (feral player)
[0:46:21] GoodyGodfather: maybe not interesting but very useful
[0:46:23] dorki: no1 cares if it's interesting they just care if it owns and is fun
[0:46:28] GoodyGodfather: ^
[0:46:32] Andypandy1238: oof rip ret palas
[0:46:33] Unius_: swapping from oblit to breath on frost is quite similar imho
[0:46:35] papach0ng: @dorki true
[0:46:43] panacer: i think thats only the case with havoc though because of the tier shoehorning throw glaive so much
[0:46:49] Thatoneorangecd: When you only change one or two talents between Aoe and ST you may as well have just kept Talent type system we had pre-Df
[0:46:49] hogbruhh: Devastation doesn't even need to change talents between raid and m+
[0:46:55] Zzekar: meanwhile there is feral who changes like 5-6 talents for ST/AoE
[0:46:56] Cyony: @Maximum kind of a weird take maybe. But i wish a little bit more specs actually had to choose between ST and AOE more. It should be that for example in m+ that you could decide between your group how to split your resources and damage types. Rather then this weird situation right now where you just play the best build 99% of the time with 1 talent difference. But i might be very much a minority there
[0:46:59] MikeyGy: Havoc is nowhere near elemental in regard to what you're talking aabout
[0:47:00] ThePencilShow: affliction is unfun no matter the damage
[0:47:24] Squats3: @Maximum when do we get Maximum Truck Sim part 2? now THAT is the content we all need. FUCK PRIUS
[0:47:25] Drenwow: Theres classes like dev evoker where you play the same playstyle all the time just spamming pyre or desintegrate for the entire expansion
[0:47:28] shinooz123: mage flamestrike/ignita build diff
[0:47:36] shinooz123: ignite*
[0:47:57] Slapsstick: @Squats3 drunk truck sim stream with a steering wheel and pedals
[0:48:12] Squats3: @Squats3 and a HUGE shifter
[0:48:25] reedsworld: i think how its funny that this whole xpac was pitched as you can play whatever talents you want but majority of this xpac for alot of specs that just wasnt really a choice
[0:48:27] xrandomdoodx: Then you have something like ele shaman, where they have either fire or lightning build, but the tier just forces them to take one. Illusion of choice
[0:48:31] freddergangster: doesnt it depend more on the base fun of the spec - like ww would be great all the time doesnt matter if you change talents or not
[0:48:46] Dreclador: @maximum what’s the connection between that and the rotation? do you think rotation should change with those changes?
[0:48:51] panacer: havoc would literally be like that without the current tier set
[0:48:55] crabonwelfare: @Maximum dont forget that DH has an uncapped AoE on 2 talent change yet there are classes which has more changes to the tree and their AoE is capped at the same time
[0:48:56] mezzery_: isn't ST just always more value than AOE because of bosses in all content types?
[0:48:56] flyingdruid1: You can only balance if the different talents become meaningless
[0:49:02] vixdran: is this talent tree the same as your mythic raid tree?
[0:49:03] Pa1ntank: I feel like Enhance shaman talents are as close to that as any other tree. There's some talents that still need adjusted, but I think you have at some point taken every talent this expansion.
[0:49:07] dorki: but it'd be like the old talent tree
[0:49:12] reedsworld: thats a design issue though
[0:49:13] Squats3: @Maximum how have you liked tier set bonuses revolving around buffing capstones? i think its shit.
[0:49:14] papach0ng: I love that enhance got a rework in their spec tree, and it's almost exactly the same
[0:49:16] dorki: just a few meaningful points swaps
[0:49:29] kotabraun: Problem on classes that have good cleave/ST spread on talents is that you don't really have build diversity within talent points themselves.  Like the biggest choices you can make are 2 or 3 nodes
[0:49:30] TBouse: talents barely mattering for damage/healing numbers sounds bad
[0:49:42] bidnezzman: perfect balance is a pipedream - gamers don't have the patience and a new patch drops before its ever achieved
[0:49:42] papach0ng: @Squats3 You must play ele
[0:49:55] Squats3: @Squats3 i have 8 lvl 70s
[0:50:02] Bladesound: what is your ideal change in output for AoE/ST? like +10 % AoE and -5 % ST is correct for you?
[0:50:08] Ojikori: !drops
[0:50:17] TTVHajun: TTVHajun subscribed with Prime. 
[0:50:18] mezzery_: wouldn't better design be that every dps is more like Ret with having to choose between AOE/ST instead of just getting both?
[0:50:24] AngryStapler: feral aoe and feral st builds are waaay different
[0:50:26] Flieris: maybe try searching for SL talent trees?
[0:50:53] shareandcare: I come from mostly playing wrath and classic and to me the current talent trees are just awesome, just a different perspective compared to someone who played retail for multiple years
[0:50:55] reedsworld: yup!
[0:51:13] Squats3: @Squats3 Mage, DH, Warrior, Priest, Druid, Hunter, Warlock, Monk
[0:51:18] slickrazor2: @Maximum im really enjoying the gameplay of wow but the lack of guilds being active really sucks Sadge
[0:51:32] Spartany25: Some classes have way better generalclass trees as well
[0:52:18] thefuntown: i think the important part is also it consolidated all of your class choices into a single pane of glass -- instead of it being in talents, conduits, soulbinds, and legendaries
[0:52:20] doom_llama: leveling is low key a great way to learn a spec
[0:52:25] Slay4daysKappa: I do think the leveling experience got alot better with new talents
[0:52:33] Korupcija_: talent trees sucks, they force us into specific build anyway with tier
[0:52:43] xrandomdoodx: @Maximum do you think it makes sense that some class trees have many throughput talents in it, while some have none?
[0:52:43] Faraday5001: current talent trees are like a Best Hits album of the last 3 or 4 expacs
[0:53:16] TBouse: isn't it weird that some tier sets require you to take a talent?
[0:53:18] thaugtless: warrior
[0:53:20] Unius_: DKs feel like that as well
[0:53:23] Unius_: shjamiSadge
[0:53:25] dorki: it's also a problem cause it added a lot of unnecessary abilities
[0:53:25] AngryStapler: Feel like feral hasnt changed much besides got aoe rip
[0:53:26] MacEleven: Rogues became pirates and it ruined the class
[0:53:28] Slay4daysKappa: You say that some specs they did not get their cool stuff (my healing brew caskets) :(
[0:53:33] dorki: like mages getting 6 defensives
[0:53:40] Alarius_: combat literally turned into outlaw not that long ago, but yeah
[0:53:50] dorki: and every mage having db blastwave
[0:53:58] Archmage_Michael: tier sets pushing you into a build is bad design imo
[0:54:02] MacEleven: Rogue changed into pirates and ruined the entire game for me
[0:54:05] Spartany25: The ones that force u to take a capstone talent r toxic
[0:54:06] Slay4daysKappa: @Alarius_ 9 years ago
[0:54:07] Unius_: @Alarius_ legion was 8yrs ago
[0:54:07] BigFatAnimal: hello max maximus maximillian smithman i hope you are well
[0:54:09] oneifbyland: @MacEleven yep just ignore 2/3 of the class 5Head
[0:54:10] Squats3: idk i dont think that was the case all the way through like.. wotlk or even later.
[0:54:10] TBouse: guardian druid tier is entirely about one talent point
[0:54:12] kuromebro: @Alarius_ bruh that was almost 8 years ago
[0:54:16] GodKingMuninn: I just hate when they choose a talent that isn't one thats easy to divert points too
[0:54:17] ImMGO: !ui
[0:54:35] Slapsstick: I just want fatty chaos bolts Sadge
[0:54:36] reedsworld: mage having 6 defensives is a double edge sword. its nice but the button bloat is a little annoying. frost is a gross example
[0:54:43] Alarius_: @kuromebro and the game is almost 20
[0:54:59] Joneim: Sundering VS Primordial wave
[0:55:04] Thoreya: @reedsworld it is so fuckin fun playing in high keys tho
[0:55:20] pag2: imagine if blade dance didn’t throw glaive. MISERABLE
[0:55:21] Thoreya: stressful, but its fun to have so many options at the right time
[0:55:21] BigFatAnimal: I wish the tier set bonuses would alter either talent on a choice node to get around that
[0:55:28] Gordiie: Chill Streak might be a fun button if it didn't just disappear if it bounces to a dead enemy, completely negating the tier set. A bug that's existed since the tier set went live on ptr :)
[0:55:35] Doenos: and season 3 for destro is "the button is great to press", but it limits you in other ways in the talent tree.
[0:55:37] Archmage_Michael: he should know beforehand if an ability sucks
[0:55:38] Thoreya: i also think some specs are just forever bland
[0:55:40] Thoreya: like destro
[0:55:44] Almedihar: Evoker's RANGE
[0:55:47] Thoreya: like how much can u improvise destro
[0:55:48] MBG_95: 1 Dev said that the Tier set makers are very Rarely the class dev
[0:55:54] LNBD: Havnt been playing alot of df lately but I personally do love wotlk overall with passiv talents and enchanting talents instead of just getting more/new abilities
[0:55:56] Thoreya: without big bolts lol
[0:56:02] Regroot_Gaming: there's no playstyle in this game , its literally same build for single target and same build for aoe , you cant play multiple builds in multiple contents
[0:56:06] Almedihar: No one likes 25 Yard / 30, just do 40
[0:56:13] Thoreya: @LNBD people play wrath still? pog
[0:56:13] Spartany25: kekw its more like blizz dev doubles down and slightly buff the ability
[0:56:20] Thoreya: thought it was just sod and df
[0:56:22] Archmage_Michael: this is one phone call to a RWF players away to know that
[0:56:23] Helios_a: fact
[0:56:39] hogbruhh: No matter how much you design a class someone who plays the game at mythic raid level will just end up knowing that class better
[0:56:43] GodKingMuninn: Siphon life is fun when its the big 5 beam giga suck
[0:56:44] sardow90: like fury forced into annihilator builds this season
[0:56:44] Korupcija_: malefic rapture NotLikeThis
[0:56:50] reedsworld: @Thoreya i have zero fun with frost. some ppl like it but manather even agreed it is a bit much
[0:56:54] AleksaMaster: is it possible that all specs have same ST, AOE, defensives, buffs, and that all difference comes down to syle of play? wouldnt that be awesome?
[0:57:05] ItMeMatt: @GodKingMuninn that's drain life
[0:57:10] Bigdamx: savage roar was nice
[0:57:11] FuchsiRA: Ele Shaman KEKW
[0:57:17] reedsworld: @reedsworld specifically revolving around cold snap
[0:57:19] Squats3: savage roar was fine =(
[0:57:21] Squats3: they ruined feral
[0:57:23] LNBD: @Thoreya I mean were just speed clearing/alt running icc and doing rs that came out recently but im enjoying it still
[0:57:40] MVPBuster: weve been hating fodder since SL
[0:57:44] Doenos: @AleksaMaster i actually love that wow has very different classes and feels and profiles offensively and defesively.
[0:57:45] RichardHultberg: Historically good players in wow from a raid/pve perspective. would be fun to hear your insight
[0:57:46] idkappa18: I really wish they would remove malefic rapture for affliction
[0:57:47] Archmage_Michael: @Maximum Do you think these class devs live in a bubble? I would assume they watch videos as everyone else.
[0:57:50] RichardHultberg: reckful did a similar thing a long time ago with pvp players, was a good video
[0:58:05] hajrudinthegiant: do you feel like old wow devs "needed an excuse" to rework a given thing and do you think they do it differently now? or they still look at some things as an Expansion based change
[0:58:24] diivil92: Give me back artifact grinding
[0:58:26] hapticsx: Realz was in the rogue discord pretty much every day during 10.2 ptr
[0:58:30] Thoreya: hot take: classes feel the best rn than they have had felt since legion
[0:58:34] Slapsstick: scarizard GIGACHAD
[0:58:35] Thoreya: shouldnt even be a hot t ake but
[0:58:36] Thoreya: overall
[0:58:41] Joneim: Man i hope you do those again
[0:58:46] Unius_: max you could go over the wowhead "a look back at xyz" and give your two cents
[0:58:49] MBG_95: @hapticsx he also didnt make the tier sets for rogue or DH afaik
[0:58:54] GodKingMuninn: @ItMeMatt Oh, then nah fuck that one -  Until they turn into a mass aoe giga suck
[0:58:58] Squats3: rip community managers
[0:59:14] itsthelichqueen: Community manager is CAREER GOAL <3
[0:59:20] questiontheauthorities: @unius_ reading those right now while listening to max
[0:59:21] hapticsx: @MBG_95 they were done by a separate team, but he was still in both discords actively when they were being reworked
[0:59:25] MrChaCho: It was pretty clear if you kept up with all of those talks and also the changes throughout beta that they were 100% listening to everything be siad
[0:59:28] Thoreya: @itsthelichqueen meh
[0:59:36] Korupcija_: and the dev slides it into the trash EZ
[0:59:40] ItMeMatt: imagine your job being to read wowhead comments TrollDespair
[0:59:43] Archmage_Michael: yes
[1:00:00] Faraday5001: imagine if Tomrus was a CM
[1:00:01] shareandcare: did those jobs survive after the recent purge though?
[1:00:02] hogbruhh: @ItMeMatt even worse if its reddit posts
[1:00:03] Suited_Monkey: Nah, I'm good
[1:00:03] JinbeiBrew: monk has no dev sadly
[1:00:04] Flieris: i just wish that the devs would commit to hpal playstyle in talent tree. We have talents for pure melee healer, casting healer and there are talents around light of the martyr that no one takes
[1:00:06] AleksaMaster: but if community managers do that, why blizzard still make so much wrong decisions? it seems like thay are cut from community an dreality
[1:00:06] teddyg55: or read Liquid Max's twitch chat
[1:00:07] Habituron: Kaivax is a cool guy. hope he wasn't one of the layoffs
[1:00:07] Slapsstick: TOMRUS Pog
[1:00:08] Thoreya: depression pog
[1:00:11] Boossterr: how would you feel about a solo shuffle style m+ bracket where it matches you with similar rated players but you can’t chose the comp or dungeon so there’s no meta comps in that bracket
[1:00:30] hajrudinthegiant: *me a community manager* "Oh shit another Warrior talk video ez day
[1:00:36] Thoreya: @AleksaMaster because theres 40 specs to balance
[1:00:39] Zzekar: @maximum then why is there a cap of 5 application in the LFG? feel like this is a major part of why puggin suks… just makes it way way harder to get invited
[1:00:40] woody1836: my nuts itch
[1:00:44] Thoreya: so every spec cant have everything they want
[1:00:45] hajrudinthegiant: No forms today
[1:00:46] itsthelichqueen: @Thoreya Depends for who, but for real I did mentorship with Blizz and I'm the type of person that loves it. It's not for everybody :)
[1:00:48] Zzekar: where are the deeevs :))
[1:00:48] ElderSeas: the warlock dev is a criminal you cant convince me otherwise
[1:01:05] imMonochrome: imMonochrome subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:01:17] Dengara: Dengara subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 7 month streak! garf
[1:01:19] Thoreya: @itsthelichqueen god bless. you got it
[1:01:20] hapticsx: They can finally hire a Windwalker dev
[1:01:22] itsthelichqueen: They are looking to hire more on the Warcraft/WoW team
[1:01:24] VelouriaVR: a lto of people i think forget is that dev can nerf/buff a class but the devs cant nerf/buff your skill lvl
[1:01:33] blacknight2k: blacknight2k subscribed with Prime. 
[1:01:34] hapticsx: instead of using an in-office suggestion box
[1:01:38] leubinator: garf
[1:01:43] JTB_099: Finding qualified is SO HARD. People with experience and fit the philosophy is crazy hard
[1:01:44] Thoreya: 10.2.5 will always be a minor patch
[1:01:45] Squats3: both the devs i know said their teams were untouched. network and art types
[1:01:47] Shmellit: True
[1:01:49] reedsworld: 100% its in a good spot
[1:01:49] Thoreya: and .6
[1:01:51] itsthelichqueen: @Thoreya There's something for everybody :)
[1:01:53] Thoreya: yeah
[1:01:55] Thoreya: its really good
[1:01:58] Scoops__: well because theres no crossover between a gaming dev team for a specific game and microsoft you need all those people
[1:02:00] goombacci: hahahah
[1:02:07] yelp26: They need more class designers. I play hpal and I am suffering
[1:02:11] Squats3: tettles is going to appear from nowhere and start crying in boomkin @Maximum
[1:02:11] Aejique: we're back to pre aug balance and it feels good
[1:02:14] reedsworld: very few specs that arent competitive
[1:02:19] Thoreya: aug is not even being taken anymore in high keys this pastfew weeks
[1:02:25] flalia4: Max you wanna come under cover raid lead this mythic vault of the incarnates? We're on broodkeeper.
[1:02:27] pokirane: garf
[1:02:28] Byggareebob: sub rogue is balanced in raid guys heard it here first
[1:02:31] Shimorta: defensives are abysmal but damage is  near flawless which is awesome
[1:02:35] Fair_BZ: @maximum blizzard was developing a game for the last three years and they didn’t like how it panned out so they canceled the program. that’s where almost all of blizzards play offs come from
[1:02:35] yama_class: did someone say poddy c
[1:02:38] TBouse: "100p" my ears
[1:02:41] dorki: !poddyc
[1:02:41] StreamElements: PoddyC is a podcast started by me, dratnos & dorki - we’re planning on doing this every week. Check it out https://twitter.com/ThePoddyC and https://www.youtube.com/@ThePoddyC
[1:02:41] reedsworld: props to them fiiguring out a balance without deleting aug
[1:02:44] Thoreya: yes
[1:02:46] Squats3: I think JB fucking NUKED augvokers - fucking dextus
[1:02:46] cawersss: let him cry
[1:02:47] Archmage_Michael: PVP tuning is the bane of M+
[1:02:53] mezzery_: poddyc episode not even up, what a tease
[1:02:53] ToxicLG: Poddyc every week Jebaited
[1:03:08] Thoreya: even noawh was saying in dorkis stream the other day that they have no idea what to run dps wise for m+
[1:03:12] Thoreya: mdi**
[1:03:26] tylxrwow: 10-15 different boomkin players
[1:03:36] GodKingMuninn: Ele and Boomy can top overall deathz EZ.
[1:03:39] hapticsx: of course theyre not gonna say what they're running for mdi
[1:03:47] Shimorta: esp during tyran week
[1:03:53] menzlo: Just buff mob HP
[1:03:55] Thoreya: yeah but if ur capped at 30. why would u wanna do 30s anymore if ur capped
[1:04:02] Thoreya: ur goal has been met
[1:04:03] Shimorta: some classes just cannot live things like stomps or flame shock
[1:04:06] AleksaMaster: do you think they are using AI now to create balance?
[1:04:07] Dreclador: they just need more selective m+ scaling
[1:04:10] Flieris: i wouldn't mind if they hire IT jobs outside of US
[1:04:10] criselbart: bring back tight timers!
[1:04:33] Shikoroh: 10.0 was ok
[1:04:36] VelouriaVR: do you think ther should be a cap to how high a key can go but then the rating is based on how FAST you do the key at that capped lvl?
[1:04:42] MrChaCho: Should enemy damage stop scaling at some point and something else should be scaled at that point instead? More health scaling, timer scaling?
[1:04:50] yelp26: They could use more class designers imo. Tuning is good but there are so many issues within so many specs
[1:04:50] menzlo: More mob HP maskes timers right
[1:04:52] Regroot_Gaming: now now as in season 3 or this expansion?
[1:04:54] Thoreya: first patch of DF was the best balancing prob ever
[1:04:56] Aejique: i really liked the 'stop incresing damage, only health' after a certain key level cook
[1:05:04] FuchsiRA: demo in m+ with guillotine, implosion and shadow invocation + tset debuff juggling is so fun but in raid its mega ResidentSleeper  lets not talk about destro and aff uff
[1:05:04] Raszbalol: season 1 df was the most diversity in titleholders by class ever im pretty sure
[1:05:09] RigatonyTV: you should repair
[1:05:09] Fortvila: even tho the balance is good, i personally would want way more frequent buffs/nerfs to change the "meta" more often. That way when u play a non meta class you dont sit there feeling you have to wait for a rework or  expansion huge changes
[1:05:12] Regroot_Gaming: Cause tuning was not very good early patches
[1:05:24] Regroot_Gaming: season 2 was garbage tuning wise
[1:05:26] Thoreya: DF was a foundation xpac. they did a lot with new UI, crafting, talents
[1:05:29] leubinator: 10.2.6 better be a banger pirate patch
[1:05:30] Shimorta: wait for 10.2.6
[1:05:32] Thoreya: that had to t ake a lot of dev time
[1:05:35] Shimorta: the mini raid is gonna go so hard
[1:05:42] Miril9: wasnt 10.0.5 just the primalist future event?
[1:05:46] Joneim: PepeLaugh
[1:05:49] Squats3: @Maximum worth noting that tanks are separated solely due to utility and not their effective health or dps. unless they gave every tank like abilities.. it wouldnt change anything
[1:05:50] disquared: !ui
[1:05:57] brruce_: D4 yuck
[1:05:58] pseudo75: HAH
[1:06:03] Faraday5001: D4 bad
[1:06:05] Its_Just_Pete: FLASHBANG
[1:06:13] menzlo: Shark
[1:06:17] MrDrexand: that's a cool wave
[1:06:20] marek48: WoW can be popular again, but in last X days they did lay off 8% of workforce
[1:06:23] menzlo: Dinosaur
[1:06:23] ItMeMatt: need a "week after blizzcon" peak
[1:06:24] Squats3: d4 season died out real fast
[1:06:36] mezzery_: d4 is dog water
[1:06:42] Kjempebikkja: devs dont care much for balance at 30 keys, so few ppl do them should they care more?
[1:06:51] AleksaMaster: Do you think aug was intentionally made OP, or it was soemthing they never realized would happen and simply made mistake?
[1:06:52] Spartany25: they wont, cuz profits is king
[1:06:53] Wyndril: They´re doing the opposite instead xD
[1:06:56] keleksbreath: circle in red so they can see better
[1:07:05] Korupcija_: they just need better reward structure to keep people playing
[1:07:10] friendshrimp: they just fired 1900 people lol dont expect them to hire
[1:07:12] Regroot_Gaming: the contents they keep making is stupid outdoors contents that ppl try for 1 day and forget about it , nothing hardcore that's the problem with blizzard
[1:07:23] Shimorta: this season for sure
[1:07:26] Byggareebob: tank dmg doesnt exist this season thats why
[1:07:27] crabonwelfare: they did buy a game studio recently and they went to work on future expansions irc (not DF content)
[1:07:35] Byggareebob: can play any tank so you just play for utility
[1:07:40] broops: broops subscribed with Prime. 
[1:07:45] criselbart: GH does most dmg
[1:07:45] FuchsiRA: warrior no1
[1:07:47] Squats3: and do you really want them to give every tank the same utility? thats no fun
[1:07:49] guynormally: warrior with 4 shockwaves Pog
[1:07:49] criselbart: DH
[1:07:50] yeyanow: Yeah but hiring people cost money, and businesses want to cut cost
[1:07:51] TBouse: bdks and brewmasters are paper in keys, it's not just about utility
[1:07:52] Byggareebob: season 2 no other tank then guardian could survive
[1:07:52] Shimorta: brew would be insane lmfao
[1:07:53] Helios_a: prot pally #1
[1:07:59] dwinftw: imagine if the mass grip of dk also silences the mob
[1:08:05] cannibalcanyon: bring back bear Sadge
[1:08:12] Byggareebob: @TBouse player diff every tank can tank every key
[1:08:18] FuchsiRA: warrior with vengeance utility seems spicy
[1:08:19] Suited_Monkey: eh, my dk holds up pretty ok
[1:08:30] Vortex1145: Hey how you all doing
[1:08:32] Benjg7: there’s still a difference in effort
[1:08:45] xxMaverick: @yeyanow so fire everyone and they increase income. what a dog water equation u got there bud.
[1:08:47] Benjg7: Trying to live a 26 fort key as brew and pally are VERY different vibes
[1:08:47] Shimorta: dorki DK would go hard
[1:08:50] TBouse: people always say any tank can tank any key, but that is meaningless. you dont make choices off of what you can do, it's what is best to do
[1:08:58] Squats3: @Maximum 25th highest rated tank is a brewmaster.. idk about that statement
[1:08:59] cheskius: if some devs watching rework DK
[1:09:00] VelouriaVR: can i also say this...can you please for the love of GOD fix your armor!!!!
[1:09:02] mooroox: mooroox subscribed with Prime. 
[1:09:03] friendshrimp: lepan best example of a tank like that
[1:09:14] cannibalcanyon: @Vortex1145 o7
[1:09:21] VelouriaVR: repair
[1:09:38] ItMeMatt: @VelouriaVR doing gods work o7
[1:09:39] Fernite95: What time is it where Max is?
[1:09:51] Squats3: @Maximum cant believe we can fly literally anywhere in the game... and youre just in valdrakken
[1:09:55] Mazkon: Questing is fucking awful though
[1:10:01] Mazkon: so no wonder youre doing that
[1:10:03] cannibalcanyon: always
[1:10:07] Shmellit: tabbed back in to see what you were talkinga bout KEKW
[1:10:11] dreamriver: so true
[1:10:15] zannuss: True, I got you on the 2nd monitor now while I do an alt raid
[1:10:16] MrChaCho: I'll be honest, you're 3rd monitor right now
[1:10:20] FuchsiRA: he mastered it q chat LUL
[1:10:22] smashi_tv: 2nd monitor streamer Sadge
[1:10:22] itsjustsarge: My mans says "I'm great second monitor content" as he's literally on the second monitor while I aimlessly fly around Valdraken and play Hearthstone KEKW
[1:10:23] Slapsstick: mr strimer can we go fly around somewhere else
[1:10:24] Ampped87: Streamers play games very differently than us
[1:10:29] PeziBear_: have you tried to play this game?
[1:10:35] Shikoroh: i love questing
[1:10:36] AgrM_Gengar: runescape questing is 10/10
[1:10:37] cannibalcanyon: 2nd monitor streamer Pog
[1:10:37] JusticeDraws: i think its fine'
[1:10:39] VelouriaVR: your fine...it jsut when you have TWO things on your UI that say your durability is low it was driving me crazy lol
[1:10:39] puremike78: yes
[1:10:40] logicaltty: i got the stream on my 4th monitor hidden under my desk
[1:10:42] pokirane: @Maximum what is the growing number at the top left of your screen? always wondered
[1:10:42] ItMeMatt: rs3 unironically goated questing
[1:10:42] labido711: Second monitor streamer sounds like an insult in the streamer community LUL
[1:10:42] FuchsiRA: you cant innovate it
[1:10:43] Faraday5001: Runescape quests are goated
[1:10:45] xrandomdoodx: questing can be interesting if its actually challenging
[1:10:45] iminshayne: OSRS quests are cool
[1:10:46] mmodenvin: nope runescape quests are good
[1:10:46] ArcaneSyntax: Questing is fun for story stuff
[1:10:47] kullkhan: Swtor questing was legit amazing.  No game has ever come close
[1:10:47] starchyarchy: whats the alternativeto M+ infinit scaling? ahorter timers? at some point is has to stop
[1:10:49] Joneim: Any quest which is a means to an end is doomed to be skipped and ignored
[1:10:50] fdb33: I kinda like questing
[1:10:51] Lightfire2093: witcher 3 quests are amazing
[1:10:52] l_uxe: runescape questing is at least funny/ironic
[1:10:52] jondbr: some quests are really fun
[1:10:52] khebul: SWTOR did quests differently
[1:10:54] Bigdamx: no unless there's giga rewards
[1:10:54] MrDrexand: old school runsescape has great questing
[1:10:54] PeziBear_: yess, God of War quest are cool
[1:10:54] Lothland: as long as the only part that is important the end game, leveling questing can't be good. Since you don't want to do it because you want to get to end game
[1:10:55] JackHealMe: Less side quests more heavy focused lore ones
[1:10:55] reggiepowa: only with a good story behind them
[1:10:56] friendshrimp: i enjoy ur wuesting content and foying wround valdrakke
[1:10:57] TBouse: it's sad you have to ask that, but of course you can
[1:10:57] Fairshihtzu: SWTOR quests are sometimes the shit, unironically
[1:10:58] jonlukk: make questing the same as the game main content, in wow make quests be in dgs or smt
[1:11:01] Faraday5001: yes
[1:11:01] menzlo: Make it as good as a single player game
[1:11:01] smashi_tv: they're cool in ff14 but that also has it's downsides
[1:11:05] ItMeMatt: yes
[1:11:06] Cycore: rs quests are actually goated
[1:11:06] Hxwkins: runescape actually does quests well
[1:11:06] l_uxe: no like they actually make them hilarious
[1:11:07] KaisenSiru: Leveling Pog
[1:11:07] kotabraun: Runescape is one the best but even then the majority of people just use plugins to do them mindlessly
[1:11:07] lasnyk: are we only talking mmos?
[1:11:08] Cakerinotv: i dont think they'[re good
[1:11:08] BigSatchel: SWTOR got close
[1:11:08] Suited_Monkey: @Maximum I think there's a big difference between questing on expac launch when you have 2 weeks until content pops off or a launch where m0 is open day 1 and you rush through
[1:11:09] tow996: french mmo dofus has very fun quests, u have insane hard solo quest fights, minigames that are bs etc... @Maximum
[1:11:10] Dreclador: questing is about chill gaming
[1:11:10] mmodenvin: nope
[1:11:11] alarkin: Quests were more interesting when the outdoor world was threatening I think
[1:11:14] AgrM_Gengar: no their actual like old school video game adventures
[1:11:15] Jogoe: remove sidequests and only do main storyline
[1:11:15] VelouriaVR: ther is no point in making it cool because once you hit max lvl ther is barely any point
[1:11:17] Dreclador: questing second monitor content
[1:11:18] dorki: it just has to be challenging and meaningful like playing elden ring
[1:11:18] Faraday5001: OSRS quests are like end goals to unlock cool shit, they arent part of the grind @Maximum
[1:11:19] sauron644: Yeah swtor quests are awesome
[1:11:20] TotallyNotRaien: ff14 has ass questing
[1:11:20] PeziBear_: KEKW
[1:11:20] Nytrand: Suramar questing was fun
[1:11:20] Aejique: I thought the WoW ones were kinda dumb, then I saw people do the New World ones lol. WoW deserves made-up innovation awards by comparison
[1:11:20] ArcaneSyntax: @maximum swtor questing is just a single player rpg
[1:11:23] Pechorin333: there is no "go kill 5 mobs" type quest in osrs, they just have actual small storylines
[1:11:23] Doomtree71: @Maximum How did your game go Thursday night?
[1:11:24] Toointro: runescape stream :D
[1:11:24] ItMeMatt: osrs quests aren't cool, rs3 quests are
[1:11:27] Fortvila: If "Story" quests are the only quests you need to reach the required level, with decent ammount of cutscenes
[1:11:30] FuchsiRA: quests are even dogwater in most singleplayer games if you dont care about the story @Maximum
[1:11:34] friendshrimp: quests in zelda are sick as fuck
[1:11:34] Zzekar: yes .. make them give a shard of item wich u can use at max lvl and unlock a cool node of abillities attached to a ring .. cool idea ha
[1:11:36] Unius_: i insta msq skipped and level boosted to 80 in ff14
[1:11:38] MrDrexand: SWTOR quests are cool but that's because it's mostly a single player story

[1:39:31] Calebkaser: yo @maximum did you see gingi might have leaked affix changes for m+ on the podcast echo did
[1:39:42] unholyxyra: Definetly, oblit is the way for me, ppl that dont play fdk think breath is super high skill build, but honestly once you get the stats up and the rotations its really meh
[1:39:58] menzlo: Any leakers
[1:40:12] Camelbak21: Send him the timestamp
[1:40:20] Onyo1337: what I dislike about breath is abusing AMS and AMZ for dps
[1:40:20] Everok: @maximum is there any footage of one of your hockey games?
[1:40:23] JoaEUW: WHAT DRINK!?!?!
[1:40:23] Calebkaser: @maximum I can’t link but it was the echo chamber podcast and the time stamp was at 50:30 in the video

[1:41:19] Calebkaser: yeah the most recent one
[1:41:26] Arabus80: @Maximum do you think Aug will get a major redesign towards 11.0? the community overall seems to be fairly unhappy about the current spec.
[1:41:35] Calebkaser: @maximum yeah
[1:41:43] AngryStapler: @Arabus80 the community mostly wants it removed from the game
[1:41:43] i_cassius: Gingi said blizz said it at blizzcon ??
[1:41:54] Joneim: Fraggos hair goes wild
[1:41:56] brocollo: yo max mind if i borrow some cigarettes?

[1:42:27] Onyo1337: actual leak ?
[1:42:29] cannibalcanyon: fully leaked lol
[1:42:29] Ruinx81: Lmao
[1:42:30] Zarroe: HOLY
[1:42:31] Faraday5001: my source is I made it the fuck up
[1:42:34] Arabus80: @AngryStapler we all know that's not goint to happen though, so a major redesign seems the best "solution"
[1:42:37] zirkzez: GingiDev
[1:42:42] Camelbak21: It's a good choice, so fuck it
[1:42:43] nekitamocika: he said they said it in discord
[1:42:46] ungnyaa: baseg

[1:42:50] Ruinx81: Gingi don’t give a fuck lmao
[1:42:54] AngryStapler: @Arabus80 plenty of other classes need a redesign first imo

[1:43:18] Slay4daysKappa: seasonals CAN be goated
[1:43:21] asd123qwerty1: whats that sponsor in the bottom right Kappa
[1:43:36] Calebkaser: yeah that was the interesting part
[1:43:39] Ruinx81: Just get rid off fort/tyran and give a seasonal
[1:43:39] Flipeled: later on he says that blizz said in blizzcon
[1:43:44] KaisenSiru: Leaks Pog
[1:43:50] oneifbyland: @Slay4daysKappa still better than "sanguine" or "storming" or some garbage
[1:44:03] nekitamocika: they ask him again about it, and he says he is sure about it
[1:44:15] Camelbak21: Alpha is supposed to be in march or something right?
[1:44:23] erdls: just joined what leaked
[1:44:24] xrandomdoodx: I hope we hear about season 4 soon
[1:44:27] 47clem: so you think s4 will have only 1 affix ?
[1:44:40] LionButLeon: Kappa
[1:44:45] Arabus80: affixed that some classes can't interact with was amoung the weirdest decisions they ever implemented
[1:44:51] MrChaCho: You've heard things though?
[1:44:52] unholyxyra: Imagine if they add an affix that will reward you if you play it(and i dont mean prideful)
[1:44:58] Sohen: all i know is these affixes are not it
[1:45:00] oneifbyland: @Slay4daysKappa like you're just trying to be a contrarian, but when ppl remember seasonals being bad that was ON TOP of already existing "regular" (bad) affixes
[1:45:00] Karenius: warrior main agrees
[1:45:06] Squats3: its not weird its just stupid
[1:45:19] lumaday: warr and dk
[1:45:21] orkarnage: warrior
[1:45:23] herptyderptyqwerty: it used to be
[1:45:25] Ruinx81: BDK
[1:45:27] Karenius: 3 min cd for shattering throw
[1:45:27] Typelouder: Warrior and UH DK
[1:45:27] malnourish_: some classes dont have a knockback and cant do shit about sanguine. etc etc
[1:45:28] yuhhhhe: warrior cant really do anything
[1:45:29] Karenius: worst class
[1:45:30] Samy_igou: warrior again
[1:45:31] luxumbra69: "not that big of a problem" lol you dont pug under the title range tho
[1:45:31] Emm_Zee: Unholy DK
[1:45:32] WaywornCypress: Stormbolt and kick
[1:45:34] yuhhhhe: unholy dk cant handle incorp
[1:45:36] kuromebro: warrior can shattering throw incorporeal lol
[1:45:37] iAruban: can rogues deak with it=
[1:45:37] draconisraccoonis: dk can mind control
[1:45:40] drychop_: dk can mc it
[1:45:42] Krappyboi: Warrior just needs jesus
[1:45:45] guynormally: DK can, it has control undead or whatever it's called. there's a macro to keep your pet, too
[1:45:47] Korupcija_: it's not easy in 10-13 pugs KEKW
[1:45:50] questiontheauthorities: dk can now control undead and is great for incorp, warrior is hot garbage
[1:45:53] Orinthe_: @iAruban bllind or kidney
[1:45:55] Emm_Zee: Unholy DK is NOT gonna mc the incorp ICANT
[1:45:59] TwentyAUT: but why farcry 5 tho?
[1:45:59] unholyxyra: Well you kinda can as unh but its a big dps loss
[1:46:00] Typelouder: Unholy DK cant MC it. it replaces your pet
[1:46:00] yuhhhhe: control undead despawning your ghoul is cancer
[1:46:01] Joneim: Lets goo
[1:46:04] Unius_: @draconisraccoonis and then it pulls mobs which aren't in combat Pog
[1:46:07] fdb33: I like afflicted over incorp cuz cleanse poison is an instant cast and turn evil isn’t kek
[1:46:07] nekitamocika: PoddyC waiting room
[1:46:08] Calebkaser: as a mostly m+ player I’m just glad to hear changes are probably coming
[1:46:08] JoaEUW: I mean isnt it good that not all classes can do everything???
[1:46:09] i_cassius: Gingi said blizz said it at blizzcon ?? 󠀀
[1:46:12] Slay4daysKappa: @Slay4daysKappa I think thundering was worse then either of those ( that might be the worst seasonal tho) but alot of them were hard to play around aka pridefull
[1:46:13] LionButLeon: PvP Bedge
[1:46:16] cataphract1014: delete pvp from the game
[1:46:19] Dzor12: @Emm_Zee I wish that was the case but I've been having to unless I want a 100% dmg reduction... very annoying
[1:46:22] draconisraccoonis: @Unius_ it doesnt tho
[1:46:27] Emm_Zee: @Emm_Zee Just AMS EZ
[1:46:29] erdls: @i_cassius what did gingi say
[1:46:29] iAruban: @Orinthe_ you would have to kidney over and over no?
[1:46:29] guynormally: @zavic123 there's a macro to keep it, don't remember what it is tho
[1:46:30] Yagr6: uhg pvp
[1:46:30] nekitamocika: Just scrap PvP in WoW its failed venture
[1:46:31] twitchyxacobe: eg. Hunter pet utility
[1:46:32] xPriamx: would you tell us if you have heard them speak about affix things?
[1:46:35] frs_392: who was in paris tho
[1:46:52] javybavy: what year is it, why on earth are pvp and pve still that interlinked
[1:46:55] i_cassius: @i_cassius about removing an affix
[1:46:57] twitchyxacobe: hunter use to be able to Battle rez with pets
[1:46:59] SniggleJake572: PvP ruins this game, prove me wrong
[1:46:59] skippiess: they removed shining force to the fucks
[1:47:00] Ancine: hunter too
[1:47:01] pokirane: give warriors lust 😠
[1:47:02] OlaF_oo: delete pvp
[1:47:03] Orinthe_: @Orinthe_ oh yeah. i hate using kidney on it, but it helps if other people aren't pullling weight
[1:47:10] Ancine: useless niche utility with low pve application, thats our hunter
[1:47:13] LionButLeon: @pokirane at that point give everyone lust lol
[1:47:19] Nyurro: They should do pvp lioke they do in ffxiv, all the classes have a completely separate set of abilities so they can balance them separately
[1:47:20] unholyxyra: Well in gw2 spells work differently in pvp and pve, they can do the same
[1:47:21] Possitiviti: would be cool to have like PvE talents only same as PvP ones
[1:47:22] Thasin22: surprised they haven't released another batch of hero talents
[1:47:22] im1nsidious: pve talents might be kinda sick idea
[1:47:28] Yagr6: ppp
[1:47:34] Camelbak21: Blizz not doing anything about Doom in demo tree cause PvPers use it KEKW
[1:47:36] honeychonker: But only 12 people actually pvp lol

[1:47:37] khebul: what percentage of players do you think cares about pvp?
[1:47:41] Squats3: they have done a good job killing pvp
[1:47:42] DISASTER03: feels bad as a dk w/o axe this week ngl
[1:47:49] pokirane: @LionButLeon i see what you're saying but feel like warriors make more sense having lust than something like evoker lore wise. like berserker type beat
[1:47:49] LionButLeon: @Squats3 KEKW
[1:47:50] Ruinx81: I hope they don’t split it
[1:47:54] javybavy: it has to be way easier to balance pvp and pve if its separated now too
[1:47:55] nekitamocika: Start with removing Tanks and Heals from PvP and it might be fun
[1:48:02] fdb33: mobas kinda killed pvp in wow
[1:48:15] menzlo: Just make it its own client
[1:48:16] ChaosNova_: Arena ruined pvp for people who wanted to pvp casually
[1:48:16] skippiess: wow was intended as a pvp game - once they released raids they took over in popularity
[1:48:18] javybavy: all the pvp ppl went to league
[1:48:20] iqsound: @Maximum Cant they do like lost ark and balance PvP and PvE differently?
[1:48:28] PDX_Pandemix: thoughts on seperating M+ and Raid how they've separated PVE and PVP
[1:48:28] Yagr6: bgs are cool
[1:48:30] Squats3: there isnt a single mmo that really does arena pvp well

[1:48:54] daiger5o: Pet battlers?
[1:48:54] oneifbyland: epic BGs are pretty fun. they just need to stop trying to cater to AWC the same way ppl dont like when they cater to RWF
[1:48:57] texazbandit: i like to be competitive so pvp is better for me
[1:49:06] pokirane: lost ark pvp is Bedge but i do like that it's a completely different system than pve
[1:49:06] unholyxyra: That issue mainly came when m+ came, if we had m+ in wotlk, we will have many of the same problems
[1:49:08] LionButLeon: @Smeeshed hybrid classes exist xdd
[1:49:21] Yagr6: just make shaman tank and now tank have a lust
[1:49:24] LionButLeon: @pokirane lost ark pvp is decent if you look at the system and how it functions
[1:49:36] LionButLeon: gameplay not so much xdd

[1:49:55] LionButLeon: @ItMeMatt well "bloodlust" and warriors goes hand in hand
[1:50:00] javybavy: just look at the m+ scores, most ppl dont even do higher than 10s
[1:50:02] woody1836: Is the stream laggy for anyone else

[1:52:33] LionButLeon: @ruediruempel no they should not, why not copy good shit?
[1:52:35] yooyoo1337: they should give hunters ar-15's
[1:52:36] Zivrum: Every game copies. Every genre of creativity steals ideas. There is ZERO original creative thought, just stolen and changed ideas built on old stolen changed ideas. That's not bad though, it builds and creates

[1:54:22] Pennzowl: Don't you copy in the best ones? why hasn't this been the case at Blizzard for 18 years? They are demonstrated by 300 devs where Blizzard has over 4000+ devs now 10,000 devs
[1:54:26] dawsonator171: max doesn't watch pvpers so he isn't inclined to say this game sucks. Confirmed.
[1:54:27] shareandcare: max, is there any way to get your twitch vods from rwf? Would love to rewatch how you figured out tindral but it seems like the videos are not there anymore.
[1:54:27] Niroggo: wow bad Clueless
[1:54:44] unholyxyra: Well blizzard is forced to split out new content and general changes cause it has to keep those high numbers of ppl entertained, smaller games release expansion once in 3-4 years
[1:54:46] pseudo75: FeelsDankMan
[1:54:57] gmacster_: yes

[1:55:39] Archerone: Do it fronk lol glhf
[1:55:42] e11m: like the speedrun history guy
[1:55:44] goblingher: Finally Fronk got something to do
[1:55:49] Sanderbrakstad: what is his chars name
[1:55:49] daiger5o: I'd watch drineys vod to se how he improves pull after pull
[1:55:51] Ewebbz: I want every pull and all the good strategy discussions
[1:55:55] BigSatchel: @ Fronk xdd
[1:55:59] Pst_Simon: Once youve done the fight yourself its really interesting to see how you got there

[1:56:35] fdb33: ez $
[1:56:35] Slapsstick: mute it LUL
[1:56:35] 101Leet: Have ai convert audio into text, then have it summarize and categorize, along with timestamping the text, have human go over categories and pick out a storyline
[1:56:36] daiger5o: Make it 8 hours and u have an alarm
[1:56:36] grimzero617: Loop it
[1:56:37] Ewebbz: I would watch probably the entire tindral and fyraak vod
[1:56:41] Zivrum: just edit the sound, drop and edit the screams to be soothing AMSR

[1:57:16] Pennzowl: wow is over 10 years behind others. blizz-con just showed how far WoW is behind others! EVERY release has been in GW2 for years. In the next 3 Expansions WoW will be where GW2 or FF14 are today!
[1:57:20] ungnyaa: reddit malding people can get an aotc mount when mythic mounts are available to casuals instantly

[1:57:55] gdtomii: W blizzard, more AoTC mounts or glad mounts
[1:57:56] Camelbak21: I'm just gna buy my AoTC mounts with tender Kappa No need to do em in current content

[1:58:23] SirAmbani: @Ghaesh no
[1:58:25] comfortingsmile: yessss
[1:58:25] oneifbyland: @AngryStapler you're not wrong, but if they aren't going to do that bringing back old mounts is fine. ppl crying about "it used to mean something" are just gatekeeping losers
[1:58:26] javybavy: that sound so awesome
[1:58:27] ungnyaa: comparing aotc to gladiator is such an uneducated take it's actually wild
[1:58:29] killerdrizzle: @daiger5o win 50 games past 2400 and you can get a glad mount
[1:58:31] gmacster_: like timerunning, if you will
[1:58:34] sickzera1: just create something new lol
[1:58:35] thecajuncommie: put everything back in the game except for the black battle tank, thats the only thing that has a little bit of "wow" too it
[1:58:41] Cakerinotv: yeah i was kinda hoping thats what they were gonna do with timerunning
[1:58:43] thelegendarysolocard: I think it's going to be a rehash of the original mythic runs in mists
[1:58:49] 01Chey: What they did with Naxx 80 but add mechanics?
[1:58:56] Pennzowl: @killerdrizzle justify it! There are thousands of reasons I have! I am excited!
[1:58:59] The_Doctor_Gandalf: I have that mount.
[1:59:00] ungnyaa: you could literally buy a garrosh heroic kill for like 10k gold in soo
[1:59:04] Mynester: Madge im mad f blizzard
[1:59:14] Zarroe: just pull the mother of all ripcords baseg
[1:59:18] thecajuncommie: I think the only thing that matters is Black Battle Tank, which I do not have myself.
[1:59:23] yeyanow: Max the enlightened centrist
[1:59:27] Camm_23: imagine we got brutosaur from trading post
[1:59:37] yooyoo1337: it would mean the world to me :)
[1:59:41] grimzero617: Get me some new weapons on par with the wod challenge mode. I don't need the exact ones

[1:59:56] Miril9: the garrosh heirlooms were datamined last summer
[2:00:00] gdtomii: @Byggareebob KEKW
[2:00:07] oneifbyland: I mean i can go transmog Thunderfury right now WHY IS THAT ALLOWED RageSwift /s
[2:00:07] javybavy: what about for new players tho, this game has so much that just doesnt exist anymore with no option to get it again
[2:00:10] pokirane: i feel like mount collecting lost its luster for me when dragonflying got introduced
[2:00:10] luxumbra69: @Byggareebob it's "start of the circle"
[2:00:11] iamtheskyy: you can yeah
[2:00:15] kuromebro: yeah like plagued proto drake

[2:00:23] KaisenSiru: Long as they dont bring back Black proto Drake
[2:00:25] richie3000: 10 mil gold
[2:00:26] daiger5o: Madge at the bm
[2:00:27] GrimmshadoXI: At some point, if you want new players, they can't be faced with a bunch of un-obtainable stuff
[2:00:31] richie3000: is like the .01
[2:00:37] cirque78: Gatekeeping is a weird mentality
[2:00:38] lumaday: was over 10 yrs ago  nah?
[2:00:39] Gibsomething: Why can't they just recolor it? People get essentially the exact same mount while the people who did it back in the day maintain their "exclusivity"  I don't care either way, this just seems like a decent fix.
[2:00:42] cataphract1014: you can give people my BC gladiator mount to everyone over my dead body!
[2:00:51] luxumbra69: war wolf
[2:00:52] ungnyaa: korkron smth
[2:00:55] GrimmshadoXI: I also bet the people who got stuff 10+ years also probably don't use them anyway
[2:00:58] luxumbra69: the top one
[2:00:59] Ghaesh: Reins of the Kro'kron War Wolf
[2:00:59] luxumbra69: ya
[2:01:02] Squats3: ye
[2:01:05] Camelbak21: Maybe to combat boost runs for mounts? Why buy a boost if you can just get it from tender, stupid but idk
[2:01:09] OG_Kawngi: me :)
[2:01:10] reymargera: 0 KEKW
[2:01:10] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[2:01:11] Korupcija_: 0
[2:01:11] Vaiilz: tbh, when they gave D3 Mount out for free at first i was kinda mad, cuz it cost quite alot of money and it was kinda rare, but at the same time i was like w/e, but the fact that Spectral tiger mounts are still something that would never be obtainable unless u buy it off ebay is beyond stupid
[2:01:11] LionButLeon: me :)
[2:01:12] Pymart: 0
[2:01:13] Squats3: it was easy as fuck to get back then.. honestly
[2:01:14] Dzor12: 1-2%
[2:01:14] Donorgyll: in theory i think they should stay unattainable because that's cool, but in reality like who cares
[2:01:14] zannuss: I think about it daily
[2:01:15] sorliee: I think about it every day
[2:01:15] B3RBAT0V: me :)
[2:01:15] gmacster_: looks bad
[2:01:16] pergynter: 0%
[2:01:16] erdls: 0
[2:01:17] ItMeMatt: that mount is ass
[2:01:18] xii_kyle: look at the comments
[2:01:23] Pennzowl: Maximum, if you knew anything outside of WoW, I could take you seriously! but WoW players are so far out of the world that it's not worth it!.
[2:01:25] verzin_: i think about that mount daily.
[2:01:26] lakris123: i didnt even know it existed until today lmao
[2:01:26] richie3000: yea not a flex. but also its considered a meta achiev
[2:01:27] ParmGG: Honestly it's all I think about
[2:01:28] Faraday5001: i think about it daily
[2:01:29] nemic1991: bro half the people commenting havent logged into the game in 2+ years
[2:01:34] notSobar: Just the feat of strength achiev
[2:01:37] Osterberg501: I have it, I don't think I thought about it after 10 minutes of getting it.
[2:01:37] KaisenSiru: Most got it from sales anyway
[2:01:41] caldricus: cant wait to have gladiator mounts in traders post soon :)
[2:01:42] Korupcija_: I didn't mount feldrake once KEKW
[2:01:43] Shikoroh: collector's logic
[2:01:47] goldfishie1: the korkron war wolf is shitty, but its just opening a door to what will/can come.
[2:01:47] drall743: i have it and didnt know thats what this is about. its meaningless
[2:01:47] reymargera: KEKW
[2:01:52] ungnyaa: it's the same redittors having a take on everything wow related that are just doing lfr and tmog runs all day
[2:01:53] Kanklz: @pennzowl lol you're still here?
[2:01:55] ThisIzD: RIPBOZO
[2:01:57] OG_Kawngi: my wife did that :(
[2:01:59] The_Doctor_Gandalf: The AOTC meant something.
[2:02:00] Niroggo: "the achievement i bought ten years ago is devalued"
[2:02:05] Itankarenas: @moonman743 it's just ugly. I've never used it a single time LUL
[2:02:07] ImBlacknel95: I'm cool as long as they put the polearm from WoD Challenges back
[2:02:08] BrainseekerEU: what about aotc from dragonflight? is there any reason to do it now if its gonne become free for everyone in a few years?
[2:02:08] Squats3: weird flex rich guy
[2:02:08] comfortingsmile: i feel like the only thing thats whack is the AOTC mount was earned not just some rando TCG purchase
[2:02:09] Pennzowl: @Kanklz u2?
[2:02:10] Chro_: Classic Strawman argument
[2:02:13] thecajuncommie: I'm a big collector, have many unobtainable things. Bring back everything, except Scarab Lord and Black Battle Tank, both of which I do not have myself.
[2:02:15] rozlotte: AotC mounts are really cool when it's current content. No one cares by the time of the next expansion
[2:02:17] pergynter: you still have the achivement mad ppl
[2:02:19] pflipz: Swift spectral tiger twitch drop for peak content
[2:02:21] GodKingMuninn: SoO aotc/mount meant nothing - we all did it for the heirlooms lets be real.
[2:02:23] daiger5o: Aotc means shit
[2:02:28] Byggareebob: what's the point of calling it "ahead of the curve" if the curve comes right back
[2:02:28] psylic: I mean, i only have my CE mounts as my random favorites for non dragon riding, because they are the only mounts that mean anything to me
[2:02:31] sLr_____: They still didnt get fucked cos they got a good gift from a loved one and that's what amtters. right? :)
[2:02:39] nekitamocika: Most people just buying achivments these days and crying about this
[2:02:40] highcard2: i want them to just send it, why have cool stuff that players cant attain?
[2:02:43] Flipeled: @Maximum timewalking raids are tuned roughly around normal difficulty, so timerunning could be a tier higher (meaning heroic)
[2:02:44] Gibsomething: AOTC mounts don't mean shit to me in terms of the exclusivity, I just want the mount. So if I got the mount, I don't care if anyone else gets it a week before me, a month after me or 6 years in the future.
[2:02:45] javybavy: FOMO collection is so lazy
[2:02:45] Sketch_Torner: Who cares about heroic mounts
[2:02:52] JansonLives: The more people cry about it, the more I want them to release more unobtainable mounts.
[2:02:55] caldricus: if they are going to add everything that is labeled unobtainable later on why bother getting that in the first place
[2:02:56] merzicdh: i think wowhead doesn't have anything to cover and they are grasping
[2:03:02] zannuss: IMO I should just be able to log on and have every item in the game
[2:03:03] MorpheenBE: BatChest raid-ready
[2:03:04] Krappyboi: KEKW
[2:03:04] nekitamocika: Raid ready boost 424 level, massive Kappa
[2:03:07] Suited_Monkey: @Maximum The rep boost in the boost is kinda bullshit tho
[2:03:08] ungnyaa: 424 ilvl and clowns were malding
[2:03:11] van_GosH: i mean this stuff are only cosmetics
[2:03:12] Krappyboi: I remember that guy
[2:03:12] reymargera: PepeLaugh
[2:03:13] Yagr6: boost me daddy

[2:03:23] Mareon58: PepeLaugh
[2:03:25] Ghendo: i would love challenge mode sets/mounts tcg mounts like the chicken and stuf
[2:03:27] Rakim88: oh the last raid boost thing triggered so many classic andies n asmon viewers LUL
[2:03:28] Touchpadwarrior: as someone that has over 1,000 mounts I am 100% down for them to re-incorporate older legacy mounts after X amount of time.
[2:03:31] nekitamocika: Raid ready, almost for LFR KEKW
[2:03:32] ruediruempel: 424 is lfr rdy KEKW
[2:03:37] thelegendarysolocard: If there was no pay to carry services it would mean something the fact that for 10 usd I can have AotC it means nothing.
[2:03:38] rosbitss: wow is so dead and blizz is making bad moves
[2:03:40] Yagr6: season 1 gear
[2:03:45] SniggleJake572: 424 is S1 gear lmao
[2:03:45] zero_rawrxd: literal auction house gear
[2:03:46] menzlo: It's only 60 ilvls from relevant
[2:03:53] sorliee: yes but wowhead comments are a cesspool
[2:03:55] Leredi: world quests gear
[2:03:55] LionButLeon: YEP
[2:04:06] Rakim88: boost was only for getting into lfr LUL
[2:04:06] Kobaaya: 424 you cant do M0 properly  LOL
[2:04:08] BreezyWinter: the trinkets are kinda sick tho tbh
[2:04:09] GENERALFISTA: they mount farming is some sort of illness, you dont need to pay attention to the opinion of this condition
[2:04:15] goblingher: People who comment on wowhead is such a tiny, tiny portion of the hardcore wow fanbase
[2:04:18] zannuss: Can I just swipe my credit card and get the leggo? I'd be fine with that
[2:04:18] FuchsiRA: TOMRUS unleashed @Maximum
[2:04:19] Slay4daysKappa: Just wait til they find out about people selling runs for gold PepeLaugh  @Maximum
[2:04:25] onkoou: @Leredi its 16 ilvls below world quests gear even LUL
[2:04:27] BreezyWinter: BreezyWinter subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:04:34] Vaiilz: @Touchpadwarrior This, but it should also include Swift Spectral/Spectral Tiger, no exceptions
[2:04:34] MrChaCho: My first aotc mount, when I just started playing, was the WoD Moose. It meant a lot to me when I earned it. I use it all the time still. But I would love to see other people able to earn it again, personally. Which imo, is entirely in line with the sentiment at the time, with the whole "Friendship Moose runs" that were going on then.
[2:04:37] ShadeCloud: To be clear, I don't care they are releasing it, but I think the mount is a little different then the gear, factions, etc.
[2:04:38] Itankarenas: larpers
[2:04:47] Suited_Monkey: I hard disagree with the rep included in it tho
[2:04:49] FuchsiRA: its still many bitter peaople
[2:04:51] Rakim88: lvling is the content that matters SMOrc classic andies avg take
[2:04:56] ungnyaa: they're all wrong
[2:04:57] ungnyaa: YEP
[2:05:01] OG_Kawngi: they eat shit for breakfast? DansGame
[2:05:06] shareandcare: and now were here malding about random complaining people, going full circle
[2:05:07] joe_g_433: you are so right
[2:05:07] rolahhnz: rolahhnz subscribed with Prime. 
[2:05:08] TheItalianStallion321: i love eating pieces of shit for breakfast
[2:05:08] xultance: I'm definitely that person where I could be riding a grey box around and don't care
[2:05:08] Flipeled: @Maximum timewalking raids are tuned roughly around normal difficulty, so timerunning could be a tier higher (meaning heroic) 󠀀
[2:05:09] ShadeCloud: ah yeah makes sense
[2:05:13] bfmv73: this game is and has always been fully of negative nancys who have nothing better to do but complain, they need to chill and just relax and enjoy the game for what it is. Who cares what wow gives away just carry on with your business ffs
[2:05:14] Gloriance: You're not wrong Max!
[2:05:14] oneifbyland: @OG_Kawngi ok Happy
[2:05:17] caldricus: if they are going to add everything that is labeled unobtainable later on why bother getting that in the first place? @Maximum
[2:05:21] Haz3ck: some of us have opinions on healthy game design that doesn't coincide with what blizzard does
[2:05:26] gdtomii: firstGarf HOLY
[2:05:31] Pennzowl: It's a dragon after all!! Can he hold on to walls? or spit fireballs? Could it perhaps glide in place for more than 4 seconds? no? why does he exist?
[2:05:31] ItzKaflo: isnt it stupid how mythic raiding is fine and the ifinite scaling into dungeons makes the god combs and downgrading classes so you dont have a chance to get invited as often with a shadow priest or whatever
[2:05:37] nrzk1: also who the fuck comments on wowhead news articles
[2:05:39] Brosauce__: i mean if you get to 70 you can buy full 421 gear which is upgradeable compared to the boost one for like 5k gold
[2:05:56] FuchsiRA: when was soo btw?
[2:06:08] mrrovonoc: hey max love the content about to hop on gonna test my luck on heroic raid
[2:06:11] ItMeMatt: can't wait to get longboi in 2030
[2:06:14] ungnyaa: only 10 years of exclusivity huuu
[2:06:16] Yagr6: in 2030 im retired and riding my motorcyle
[2:06:19] Rakim88: cause later is almost 2yrs later? at that point it doesnt matter to u if they did it when u actually play the game
[2:06:21] zannuss: I'm waiting till 2124 when everything is just free
[2:06:22] thecajuncommie: if you got something way back when, it matters that you got it way back when, bc thats cool
[2:06:24] yeyanow: The long con
[2:06:26] zandalarri: @FuchsiRA Last raid of Mists of Pandaria
[2:06:27] notSobar: lol everyone wanted the lego weapon
[2:06:28] Lorazen: its both a long way away as well as not guaranteed
[2:06:32] nekitamocika: Most of these achievements are bought with money and gold these days, they dont have any value to begin with.
[2:06:32] cataphract1014: Everyone got aotc back then for the heirloom weapon anyway
[2:06:34] Touchpadwarrior: 100%
[2:06:34] daiger5o: If u can grind it now why wait
[2:06:37] ShadeCloud: I think it would change people who buy carries
[2:06:38] RamblingJosh_: SoO is the ONLY AotC I ever got, was so long ago who cares
[2:06:40] comfortingsmile: theyd also say what the fuck is a traders post
[2:06:47] xii_kyle: My prized possession war wolf
[2:06:49] Tehqq_: Yeah
[2:06:50] Everok: Probably

[2:11:01] nekitamocika: Wasnt there some PvP booster that said he made like 100k in BFA
[2:11:03] pflipz: Hundreds of dollars on pizza rolls
[2:11:04] iridae: I still get youtube ads for rmt boosts
[2:11:06] TheItalianStallion321: totino's pizza rolls lol
[2:11:07] Lorazen: thats crazy
[2:11:10] fdb33: jesus fucking christ
[2:11:12] goblingher: what? HUH
[2:11:15] xDeceit: cash for life lottery
[2:11:15] Yagr6: drug money
[2:11:15] ShadeCloud: yeah that's NUT
[2:11:16] brocollo: you remember that WoD christmas chest u could open but not loot and return to vendor to get a mount and the auction house was flooded with nice stuff
[2:11:17] nrzk1: what key level equivalent was mop challenge modes?
[2:11:20] zero_rawrxd: you got paid more than my full time job wtf
[2:11:31] sheckles: 125 An hour jesus christ
[2:11:32] highcard2: +5
[2:11:34] nightst314: 10s by todays standards
[2:11:34] GER_Mad: i got my CM boost back then for 20€ LUL
[2:11:34] Yagr6: prob a 15
[2:11:36] Korupcija_: +10
[2:11:43] vepsee: +2
[2:11:45] KaisenSiru: CM scaled gear too I believe
[2:11:47] Karenius: @GER_Mad HUH
[2:11:47] miketrouts: wowchallengemodes .com i went to highschool with james KEKW
[2:11:55] Wikedlyrics: like doing +10s in heroic dungeon ilvl
[2:11:58] ungnyaa: nah that's cope
[2:11:59] Yagr6: no way
[2:12:02] GER_Mad: @karenius yep
[2:12:11] thelegendarysolocard: Having to reroll gear stats at that time made it way harder
[2:12:12] dampKrabb: With today's skill I'd say week 1 +20
[2:12:15] goldfishie1: just getting gold wasnt hard. you could 3man gold.  it was getting dungeons into the 4mins that was hard
[2:12:18] delcubalibre: like was it harder before?
[2:12:26] tinkerlinker: get in some mythic plus
[2:12:29] Ghendo: î think you can compare it with a 15, having 230 ilvl @Maximum
[2:12:30] toastbam: @delcubalibre no people were worse
[2:12:33] BombBoyZero: CModes were +5s at the beginning of S1
[2:12:36] RamblingJosh_: People were bad but CMs weren't that hard comparing just the content
[2:12:38] Wikedlyrics: you also had to 3 chest them not just beat them in time
[2:12:43] pokirane: no weakauras too om
[2:12:45] nightst314: trash and bosses had half the abilities back then
[2:12:48] Darkenet: It was equal to heroic dungeon gear ilvl
[2:12:53] yuhhhhe: kinda wish m+ was like that now
[2:12:55] dampKrabb: I did a shit ton of them but you needed good strats to complete them
[2:12:58] delcubalibre: @toastbam i see. so its still hard but people are better now a days?
[2:12:59] nightst314: and tanks did 40-50% of the  damage at the end
[2:13:01] oneifbyland: @delcubalibre people were worse, yes, but content WAS also easier
[2:13:01] Camelbak21: Go to youtube and watch some CM vids
[2:13:04] Fusionz01: Big pulls Big numbers Big dopamine
[2:13:05] KaisenSiru: Power Auras Pog
[2:13:06] Serenitylol: powaauras was the shit
[2:13:08] honeychonker: You could optimise the shit out your gear too
[2:13:11] BrainseekerEU: remember having like 28 gems
[2:13:13] Yagr6: lol
[2:13:15] pokirane: OMEGALUL
[2:13:15] sfilipej: top gear was the more slots the better
[2:13:17] toastbam: KEKW
[2:13:18] thelegendarysolocard: Dbm was kinda useless back then too
[2:13:19] FrilleJr: Prayge
[2:13:22] lumaday: well put
[2:13:23] Rakim88: weakauras existed in powerauras around naxx
[2:13:26] EmberJG: LUL
[2:13:27] Pennzowl: WoW is Gearbased not Skillbased!! this is the diffrend
[2:13:27] Touchpadwarrior: I remember powerauras LUL
[2:13:36] iMuru: Or a big ol lichking model KEKW
[2:13:37] rozlotte: got my proc, praise the lord
[2:13:37] Yagr6: pizza slice for proc
[2:13:40] yuhhhhe: when they said jesus would return i never thought it would be in wow
[2:13:41] sdjfn: Is it time to watch some old Max WW Butcher gameplaý
[2:13:43] tinkerlinker: can you do some Chad dps for us for some content
[2:13:45] gdtomii: @Maximum Like the Paragon healer having a My Little Pony power auras on Garrosh KEKW
[2:13:54] SniggleJake572: @Pennzowl naw
[2:14:05] CrazyKanax: ?
[2:14:06] oliverflindtgotfredsen: are you going to the streamer awards? :D
[2:14:06] CrazyKanax: ;)
[2:14:07] Darkenet: Pennzowl lil bro we are literally just talking about challenge modes where the gear is scaled down
[2:14:08] icculus86: Well how "rare" was it.  Was it as rare as seeing someone with KSM?  KSH?  All 20s?  3K IO?
[2:14:08] CrazyKanax: ?
[2:14:08] BombBoyZero: Lego cloaks made it really easy
[2:14:10] CrazyKanax: ;)
[2:14:10] Unius_: i think its crazy bigwigs is now called "big wigs (dbm alternative)" on curseforge
[2:14:19] dorki: it'd be like getting ksm
[2:14:24] ungnyaa: COPIUM people buy +20 sales non stop rn
[2:14:25] goblingher: @Pennzowl my m+ experience tells me that gear does not matter at all lol
[2:14:29] Rakim88: @Maximum have u watched the preach series yet on the old days of raiding scene?
[2:14:32] Yagr6: m+ made the player base better as a whole imo overtime
[2:15:00] Darkenet: Yagr6 true, cause it makes even casuals kinda improve gradually
[2:15:00] honeychonker: People these days would also hyper optimise trinkets, enchants and weird scaling items @maximum
[2:15:06] souledk: mega dungeon week 1 with a timer probably
[2:15:08] equinox_flare: challenge modes were like doing +28s?
[2:15:08] DONGAMAN: WOAH ITS SATURDAY
[2:15:09] MrAxeffect: the game has pushed players to get better
[2:15:11] van_GosH: but it was back in the day so much fun, when u archive it by urself
[2:15:12] yiannisjk: Can you talk about the actual requirement to have a specific keystone of a specific level vs. back then when you could just enable Challenge Mode on demand for any dungeon at any time
[2:15:19] thelegendarysolocard: The community is far less casual now
[2:15:30] Ark1G: @Pennzowl ive seen people with 484 gear do less damage than someone with 464 gear
[2:15:33] Thoreya: and f raids
[2:15:33] Snoizer93: thank god for m+
[2:15:34] xii_kyle: m+ gotta be the best system in any video game
[2:15:37] Thoreya: lol gimme 5 man content anyday
[2:15:42] Kanklz: Dude I love people like @pennzowl just says random bullshit
[2:15:42] monochromator: The game forced people to get better. Think DF dungeons vs even a few expansions ago
[2:15:47] ItzKaflo: infinite scaling is fucked up tho rather +20 cap and master it on diff classes for balance!!!
[2:15:54] iridae: When I look back my current group of friends could tag a new player along and time CMs, even though they took multiple attempts back then for one gold
[2:15:56] Yagr6: my god i think 10 man raiding in todays wow would go hard af
[2:15:58] UnheardGrace: did you ever watch/react to "Why it's rude to suck at warcraft"?
[2:16:00] LotteC: that is kinda what you had to do back then, go to previous raids to get bis items for CM
[2:16:04] tinkerlinker: bring windwalker back!
[2:16:06] Pennzowl: @goblingher M+ the GW2 fractal copie? Blizzard still can't achieve a balance where it works well for Arena Net!
[2:16:10] Thoreya: @ItzKaflo are u saying 20 keys are not balanced?
[2:16:12] Thoreya: what lol
[2:16:15] ItMeMatt: Pennzowl is ai
[2:16:16] goldfishie1: the community for CM racing was like 4 teams back in mop/wod
[2:16:25] ItzKaflo: +20
[2:16:25] itachiikun33: Hey Max wanna take my 24 EB ? @Maximum
[2:16:28] itachiikun33: tank
[2:16:33] Unius_: @Yagr6 i played a 2/2/6 heroic run recently and really fun
[2:16:33] Thoreya: imagine doing 20s rn and being capped to do any higher bc of 'balance' ICANT
[2:16:44] goblingher: @Pennzowl ah you dont play wow, Now I understand why you typed that.
[2:16:45] oneifbyland: can you still do hardmode VOTI on m0 ?
[2:16:53] ItzKaflo: on sooner expansions
[2:17:01] gdtomii: no progression
[2:17:08] ItzKaflo: make it balanced hard with a cap so you can master diff classes
[2:17:10] equinox_flare: i support whatever they need to do to get cloudsong glaive back
[2:17:10] itachiikun33: thought id shoot my shot lol
[2:17:12] ItzKaflo: but still hard enough on cap
[2:17:21] holypaladinyuh: would u support removing keystone depletion, if u fail a 26 ur key stays a 26 @Maximum
[2:17:22] fdb33: massively overhped video
[2:17:24] Touchpadwarrior: another weird thing about doing CM's was you'd sometimes spend more time in the first half of the dungeon trying to do a weird specific pull for time & constantly resetting if you failed it
[2:17:29] Kripttyk: what i think would be better is having a generic key with the appropriate affixes, where you can go to any of the dungeons on rotation, instead of being locked to specific ones - coz people are going to farm xyz dungeons anyways
[2:18:13] ItMeMatt: isn't that just what happens in the top level rise keys
[2:18:23] ncg20: It would be miserable, to start every dungeon
[2:18:31] Scoops__: monkaHmm
[2:18:35] thelegendarysolocard: Unless I'm misremembering you had to sort of attune to challenge modes did you not?
[2:18:37] tinkerlinker: max why not gear your windwalker instead of just flying around?
[2:18:37] lurthemir: Crackpot theory: What if at +21 a fourth affix unlocked but you chose 3 for the key.
[2:18:38] Leredi: what do you think, will expansion be postponed, because these layoffs
[2:18:52] Flipeled: @Maximum what if you can't enter that dungeon on that level for 2 hours if you fail it?
[2:19:00] Ok_Kingston: @Leredi they didnt fire anyone in wow lmao
[2:19:00] stronkbicep: I like that it stings to fail a key, in legion it was too harsh, I do understand that is annoying if you are practicing though
[2:19:03] ItzKaflo: 20% more gold would be fine too as reward
[2:19:11] Pennzowl: It hurts but that's how it is! Without GW2, no M+ or Dragonflight and future Expansions. I can't help it that it's the truth!
[2:19:16] AkuTVgg: my M+ take is always a completed key should either go up if timed or stay same if not timed. deplete should only be if key abandoned
[2:19:20] MerrieChristmas: mmm steaks
[2:19:27] GodKingMuninn: A key shouldn't go down a level if you atleast finish it
[2:19:32] highcard2: a full revamp could be nice
[2:19:33] Korupcija_: it's soooooo STALE
[2:19:35] Milanesa_De_Pollo: remove depletion YEP
[2:19:45] alqallafi: delves
[2:19:50] Milanesa_De_Pollo: remove tyrannical/fortified YEP
[2:19:54] highcard2: but we also have to consider they could just make a new m+ system that is worse
[2:19:58] goblingher: @Maximum what do you think the meta would be if keys capped @25 and time only mattered?
[2:20:06] highcard2: i would like to take the risk though
[2:20:10] Leredi: @Ok_Kingston but who then, HotSers?
[2:20:15] Red_Fr0st_: d4 moment KEKW
[2:20:17] ncg20: Do you think they'll make the evoker/axe legendaries fated in s4 or is all the gold people sunk into it going to be lost
[2:20:18] Korupcija_: Aware
[2:20:18] grieze: it's blizzard, either are possible
[2:20:19] xxMaverick: it's blizzard...
[2:20:20] ErikJugend: @Maximum I really like JB's idea of the dungeons stop scaling at 25 and then beyond that you reduce the timer
[2:20:25] blowdapoppin: Do you think variations to the 5 man grps and 1-3-1 can change?
[2:20:25] Flipeled: @goblingher uncapped aoe classes would rule, you would pull trash with bosses and pull big
[2:20:26] sharpps: welllll
[2:20:28] ShadeCloud: Instead of bad affixes they should make affixes that buff you
[2:20:29] Kripttyk: what i think would be better is having a generic key with the appropriate affixes, where you can go to any of the dungeons on rotation, instead of being locked to specific ones - coz people are going to farm xyz dungeons anyways 󠀀
[2:20:35] NastieTV: With Blizzard thought, likelihood is worse systems historically though no?
[2:20:40] AerialAce94: saying they shouldn't try because "it might be worse"  is one of the worst takes ever
[2:20:41] Thoreya: WHAT IS THE FUN OF CAPPING A 25
[2:20:43] rosbitss: whos JB?
[2:20:45] Red_Fr0st_: @Maximum Look at diablo 4 systems and diablo 3 systems, blizzard CAN make worse
[2:20:45] Milanesa_De_Pollo: GIGACHAD
[2:20:47] rosbitss: JUSTIN BIEBER?
[2:20:48] Thoreya: why would u ever strive to do keys anymore
[2:20:49] Pennzowl: M+ is the Mechanic from GW2 Fractals!
[2:20:53] gmacster_: I didn't know justin bieber played wow
[2:21:01] gdtomii: JB GIGACHAD
[2:21:03] xxMaverick: @Thoreya link your 30s then
[2:21:07] oneifbyland: @grieze it's possible initially yes, but you're ignoring the fact they could just 1) iterate based on feedback or 2) simply revert back to this system worst-case
[2:21:07] thelegendarysolocard: I think the biggest issue I have with mythic plus at the moment is that mobs wipe far more often the bosses mid tier.
[2:21:07] cCyrex: whats the jb take?
[2:21:12] splashz0r: it's an ancient take that JB can take the claim since no one else was alive GIGACHAD
[2:21:14] rosbitss: @gdtomii Who is this gigachad>?
[2:21:19] VolitionFPS: ayo?
[2:21:22] gmacster_: crank the knob yep
[2:21:33] Thoreya: @xxMaverick would what players ever strive for to do higher keys knowing its capped
[2:21:34] AerialAce94: but you are still just going to hit a wall with a reduced timer as well, it doesn't really solve anything just moves the problem
[2:21:36] ruediruempel: then the really high m+ players would be bored
[2:21:38] Thoreya: its a psychological thing
[2:21:41] fdb33: Max u sayin u dont enjoy cranking your knob?
[2:21:43] proppjanne: @Pennzowl you had your moment, stop being cringe
[2:22:00] Thoreya: why would*
[2:22:11] Thoreya: they would also have to erase TGP
[2:22:13] xxMaverick: @Thoreya m+ used to be about how fast you could run the key. now you can wipe 50 times and still time it and get loot. kekw
[2:22:20] Thoreya: if that happened so, which people like, so its ironic
[2:22:26] Thoreya: more than mdi
[2:22:29] ruediruempel: just make timer the cap not the oneshots easy fix
[2:22:32] ncg20: Even a 28/29 stuff will 1 shot all over compared to like a 26
[2:22:37] gmacster_: shoutout
[2:22:41] splashz0r: less than .7% of players even see a +25 KEKW
[2:22:42] MrChaCho: old shoutout
[2:22:44] nightst314: @Maximum in S2 with a 32 ceiling less than 0,01% of all runs were 25 and higher
[2:22:58] bakingbad: I guess that logic applies to mythic raiding aswell maybe?
[2:22:59] Ferendel: @Thoreya You could argue that they like it better because it's actually what people do on live
[2:23:00] sorliee: gigach
[2:23:02] sorliee: GIGACHAD
[2:23:09] xxoutkastedxx: Ive been playin since vanilla, ive never seen 25
[2:23:10] reggiepowa: You have %s on raiderio
[2:23:11] GodKingMuninn: *** statistics and using the title cutoff as a measurement
[2:23:11] cataphract1014: raider io has some info
[2:23:11] Kripttyk: @Maximum what i think would be better is having a generic key with the appropriate affixes, where you can go to any of the dungeons on rotation, instead of being locked to specific ones - coz people are going to farm xyz dungeons anyways
[2:23:11] splashz0r: naw *** got some stats
[2:23:13] Thoreya: @Ferendel so whytf would u cap it lol
[2:23:14] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Stomach feeling GIGACHAD
[2:23:14] Saahf: baseg spreading misinformation
[2:23:14] ncg20: source: Me
[2:23:18] VesperalTV: twitch chatter
[2:23:19] nightst314: @Maximum in S2 with a 32 ceiling less than 0,01% of all runs were 25 and higher and I have a spread sheet to prove it!
[2:23:19] Thoreya: that is my whole point
[2:23:21] sharpps: those stats are kinda on RIO
[2:23:22] cannibalcanyon: KEKW
[2:23:23] Voyburke: Its more like .067
[2:23:24] strawberrycakesareinsane: it would be fine to better gear up alts and enjoy more classes too when there is a cap on m+
[2:23:25] OXDOX: Making shit up goes hard
[2:23:26] Yagr6: deep dive
[2:23:26] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: @Maximum Flying around stormwind is the new meta what you doin
[2:23:27] Kobaaya: there is literaly no point for average player to go over 20 but for flex
[2:23:30] Slay4daysKappa: baseg how can i not know my numbers when i made them up
[2:23:30] cataphract1014: if you go to the title cut off
[2:23:37] souledk: it doesn’t
[2:23:42] gfkoe: so it would be way lower
[2:23:46] Kanklz: Then it would be even lower
[2:23:56] bakingbad: whats the % of players that don't ever go into a m+ just of the top of your head?
[2:23:58] Vaiilz: isnt that number also only based on the ppl with raiderIO installed ?
[2:24:01] Ferendel: @Thoreya Because then people would play that and relate to MDI style more thus having a chance to see if they prefer playing and relating to that
[2:24:03] Yagr6: anything over 20 is ego
[2:24:09] yiannisjk: How can less then 0.7% of players see a +25 when for the 0.1% title you gotta be doing +31s
[2:24:13] Hunfoxx: never did m+ before, im doing it now so. Most people dont like it
[2:24:13] xxMaverick: look at the title cutoffs
[2:24:14] trentbail23: do a dungeon.
[2:24:18] Kanklz: It wasn't me lol, was just commenting
[2:24:18] nightst314: @Maximum look in the "General" discord channel, linked you a spreadsheet
[2:24:19] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: If you're not doing M+ what are you doing?
[2:24:19] Lara_TV_: did they censor rio
[2:24:22] AerialAce94: i just hope they don't waste time solving a problem that doesn't affect the vast majority of the player base
[2:24:23] just_one_sock: did you know less than 0.9% of things chat say are valuable to you or society as a whole?
[2:24:24] Lara_TV_: nvm
[2:24:26] Celestial990: @nightst314 The m+ title is 0.1% and s2 title required keys that were above all +25s so this cant be right
[2:24:30] BrainseekerEU: 62.2% of the players who has timed a +24 or higher has never had sex
[2:24:33] Jaux2: @yiannisjk ?
[2:24:35] Thoreya: @Ferendel i think to erase the concept of pushing higher keys completely eliminates the concept of keys in general
[2:24:36] splashz0r: @yiannisjk that literally doesnt make any sense
[2:24:40] alex_s93: 1% Cutoff is 3300 with is 25/26 Keys
[2:24:46] stelfbronco: @maximum why don’t you do raid finder see how bad it is
[2:24:47] Ancine: ***
[2:24:47] Milanesa_De_Pollo: chat
[2:24:50] Thoreya: they should call it challenge modes instead then, not m+
[2:24:50] Jaux2: @alex_s93 ????
[2:24:52] YouKnowThisXD: @yagr6 every level above 20 still has chances to increase the amount of loot in the end chest, so farming 23s is more loot efficient than 20s
[2:25:06] Xann_: Do links to your sponsored content, also get timed out @Maximum
[2:25:15] dampKrabb: Cut off for 0,1% is 3378.9 currently which should be mostly 25s
[2:25:17] gfkoe: @alex_s93 in the us top 1% is 3216
[2:25:23] RiverWell: just whitelist rio site :xdd:
[2:25:28] antongustafsson9: Did you see the kings sabres game?
[2:25:29] cataphract1014: dont you just give random people mod though
[2:25:31] bigchurchman: just dont think about it Kappa
[2:25:32] nellfin: ***
[2:25:35] Wikedlyrics: what if mod gets hacked PepeLaugh
[2:25:35] Ferendel: @Thoreya People loved challenge modes and the MDI is still super competitive. Speedrunning is still progression, just a different kind.
[2:25:36] fdb33: step 1, get mod in max's channel. Step 2, profit
[2:25:38] Slay4daysKappa: PepeLaugh
[2:25:39] s_thetic_steve: how about that whirlwind barb website meatspin
[2:25:42] Saahf: so i theory we just get mods to send malware?
[2:25:42] slowfetch: yeah you do
[2:25:44] MrChaCho: noone's abused it.. yet
[2:25:44] highcard2: hasnt backfired yet
[2:25:46] ShadeCloud: bro I feel like you modded actually hackers at some point tbh
[2:25:46] Ancine: @dampKrabb u are looking at wrong stats, it is around 3560 on eu
[2:25:46] tunedem_: @dampKrabb NA cutoff is 3500 right now for title
[2:25:48] Jaux2: where are ppl getting these fake cut off numbers?
[2:25:49] Lorazen: what mod is sketchy
[2:25:49] Jjmn12: alejandro monkaS
[2:25:50] Vaiilz: Sketchy mods AWARE
[2:25:55] 1111111111112233: sketchy mods linking malware Susge
[2:25:55] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: go give that dog a hug
[2:25:57] Zarroe: on a totally unrelated note max u should mod me Kappa
[2:25:58] Jaux2: its literally 3498 on raider io
[2:26:03] nightst314: just look in your discord @Maximum I've link a google doc tracking all of DF data I could get my hands on

[2:45:23] Lara_TV_: You are a maniac 100%
[2:45:25] Themselves: it's so you can say you've been x rank at one point. they try to flex it on legit players
[2:45:28] Ancine: they are too stupid to really think about the purpose of their cheating
[2:45:29] nellfin: neither, i know a sick cs player who cheated just because he was bored and found it funny
[2:45:35] ShaggySummers: qit's an interesting way to interact with gaming. I did it for 2 days. It's actually just pure entertainment.. at least it was for me @Maximum
[2:45:37] Shishikura: there's a lot of "i deserve these wins but x factor is holding me back"
[2:45:44] icculus86: I'm inclined to say for the same reason people have smurf accounts.  Sometimes it's just fun to stomp.

[2:47:08] Celissah: @Maximum What would you think if we'd get a system where we could upgrade a item with like 18xToken of Merits to myth track? Could be more expensive aswell. But should be able to upgrade to myth track on 1-2 items per season.
[2:47:27] Kobaaya: they cheat coz they got no reflexes to do good  :(
[2:47:29] Nickystr1x: kids are practically domestic terrorists
[2:47:37] Archerone: the Goolag would be an appropriate place to keep cyber cheaters
[2:47:43] majestictaco0: when is mdi again?
[2:47:45] kuanochaites: Balders gate 3 is way more worth it with other people too imo
[2:47:47] jonlukk: bg3 lets gooo
[2:47:54] murloc_kingkiller: as i kid, i stole one of the ds game card cases bc i thought it contained games but they were just cardboard cutouts
[2:47:54] Team_Spanky: @Maximum PLEASE do BG3 Off Stream for your own enjoyment. Treat yourself
[2:47:56] LemmingsOCE: Variety would be fun to watch
[2:48:00] Yagr6: rainbow 6 is good if you got some friends to check it out with max, but high ranks alot of cheats
[2:48:09] DONGAMAN: hero talent interviews Pog
[2:48:10] highcard2: i think you'll burn out on bg3 pretty fast
[2:48:11] Denekyy: did u give up on the key grind ?
[2:48:15] highcard2: i dont think its your type
[2:48:15] PurpleKami: bro the weekly ptr build info dumps are something I crave bad rn
[2:48:25] LemmingsOCE: You played THE FINALS? i know you like some shooters
[2:48:30] LemmingsOCE: That games tight
[2:49:04] ikMaxx: @Maximum play WW!!
[2:49:10] Krappyboi: Why hasn't blizz released another 4 hero talent trees? I feel like alpha is coming in like 2 months and they need to reveal more ahead of time
[2:49:12] Ryaslayer: have you played feral druid though? they're a cat it's so cool
[2:49:14] TheRealDadTV: bring out bobbybones
[2:49:22] lezugg: @Maximum Have you tried enhance on retail? It super fun
[2:49:25] nekitamocika: Do DHT 1st boss on Tyranical PepeLaugh
[2:49:32] ThisIzD: we need Cleetus McLonghaul.
[2:49:43] Yagr6: do you like mobas like hots
[2:49:52] PublikPriest: layoffs might be delayed stuff
[2:50:04] murloc_kingkiller: when do we see the tier sets for S1 TWW?
[2:50:06] Erllep: @Maximum what raid would you think would be the most fun if they scaled like fated raids in SL?
[2:50:10] Slapsstick: could show us the tank max again, higher key this time tho
[2:50:15] chimeraxst: think after this xpac with there seasonal timing they can definitly push the dungeon pool to 10-12 dungeons a season
[2:50:20] Shikoroh: max do you think a 20 man raid of only raid leaders would work extremely well ?
[2:50:22] Krappyboi: Fair, but they did say that the alpha this time is more complete than last time
[2:50:22] Ekaan92: im so exicited for riders of the apocalypse
[2:50:41] Yagr6: 10 man raiding please i beg blizz
[2:50:52] Shikoroh: true natural
[2:50:57] TheRealDadTV: do you think it will turn in to a big dick swinging
[2:51:07] Celissah: 20 RL vs 20 Raiders. Would be fun :D
[2:51:15] zenkodac: Shikoroh probably not, to many strong opinions
[2:51:17] bhawjue: LOL
[2:51:17] murloc_kingkiller: when do we usually see the tier sets for S1 TWW?
[2:51:21] Everok: @maximum which one do you consider yourself
[2:51:25] ikMaxx: why
[2:51:37] LuciFeariUm: @TheRealDadTV this
[2:51:41] Raigoro: TRUE leaders would know who would be the TRUE leader
[2:51:42] Ok_Kingston: 20 RL would all try to get out of making calls, and then would overlap eachother by default
[2:51:53] ShinehornLukita: how can you know if you're a natural leader or if you're a wannabe leader?
[2:51:55] slowfetch: too many cooks. too many cooks
[2:52:01] jandemain: too many chefs in the kitchen
[2:52:03] LuciFeariUm: too many cooks in the kitchen
[2:52:22] StanRaenslen: 1 person is 5% of a raid
[2:52:28] Shikoroh: i raidlead only because i can do dmg and talk at the same time Sadge
[2:52:29] icculus86: LF1DPS - must be ENTP
[2:52:35] murloc_kingkiller: Cant have multiple head chefs in a kitchen is a good examp
[2:52:41] itsCelivan: I guess the question is are you putting together 20 RL or 20 control freaks?
[2:52:42] ikMaxx: just as bad as 20 ppl with no leader at all?
[2:52:44] ungnyaa: have to test the RL's haki
[2:52:45] krocdp: i just enjoy solving mechanics and strats, not really leading for me
[2:52:47] Scoops__: itd be more impressive if you COULD get that many in one guild
[2:52:49] DrakeDuude: I always in every job in every place im placed at leadership.
[2:52:54] bhawjue: big difference between someone wanting to be in "charge" and a leader..
[2:52:54] BrainseekerEU: you know
[2:52:57] lurthemir: Time to go back to 40 man raiding to get a good leader distribution
[2:52:57] Ok_Kingston: your guild will tell you
[2:52:58] krocdp: do people listen to you? lmao thats how
[2:53:00] stefanfoyn95: people follow you? LUL
[2:53:07] Yagr6: if people follow you then you a leader, just look behind you bro
[2:53:08] Slapsstick: it def would be, thats part of why the chain of command exists to begin with
[2:53:09] highcard2: my favorite type of leader is the reluctant one
[2:53:18] highcard2: who doesnt want to but is forced
[2:53:18] druidtankguy: people want to follow you if youre a true leader
[2:53:21] zenkodac: i mean also take all that personality stuff with a grain of salt too
[2:53:21] druidtankguy: less push back
[2:53:27] Suited_Monkey: I always gravitate towards that role, raidleading, teamleader in airsoft.
[2:53:29] Snoochey: I end up leading a lot and I hate doing it, but no one else ever steps up
[2:53:40] icculus86: What if you do all that just because everyone else is a god damn moron?
[2:53:40] murloc_kingkiller: Great leaders don't seek to lead, they're called to it
[2:53:41] goblingher: Most Politicians
[2:53:42] SirBlayks: If you tend to tell people what to do and empower people to do things, you're a leader
[2:53:46] Squats3: results is the best metric. lots of people want to lead so they find themselves shoving their way into that position
[2:53:48] ungnyaa: i'd rather follow not because i can't be in charge but because i'm lazy xdd
[2:53:49] Yagr6: what about the guy who works better alone
[2:54:00] IdkDream: doing a mythic broodkeeper rn and this shit is brutal for the frames how is this even a fight
[2:54:10] slimicc: What if you´re a good leader but yo don't want to lead
[2:54:50] TheRealDadTV: is that why you havent started the dad guild yet
[2:54:55] ungnyaa: too real
[2:55:07] Holytronic: .... and then chime in with good suggestions and eventually get piled on with responsibilities and become the leader naturally again.
[2:55:14] KunaiKama: jordan belford style ?
[2:55:28] Ok_Kingston: that is THE cycle
[2:55:33] Ok_Kingston: god it happens every time
[2:55:36] ikMaxx: I lead my dog, thats why I dont RL in wow. Too much leading in my real life already
[2:55:37] Yagr6: some lead by example and not words
[2:55:47] Chro_: Didn't need to get called out like that
[2:55:55] rexw: pants or shorts
[2:55:57] iWender: Are drops fixed?
[2:56:05] murloc_kingkiller: do you walk em?
[2:56:10] skilgann0n88: Happy puppies

[2:57:24] LuciFeariUm: oh yeah
[2:57:29] BrainseekerEU: or just walk your dog
[2:57:30] methuenite: makes you wonder what they are doing with the poop
[2:57:36] LuciFeariUm: its like cheap as fuck
[2:57:37] Rendlaws: weird flex
[2:57:44] goblingher: KEKW
[2:57:44] Disect: HUH
[2:57:47] ikMaxx: out of context but ppl are getting rich doing dog walking work. I pay 30 euros per day
[2:57:47] Efluonidel: You can't leave it there? lol
[2:57:51] mycho_: Poop technician
[2:57:51] gmacster_: ah yes the poopnician
[2:57:52] holdenwook: poop technician
[2:57:54] oneifbyland: @BrainseekerEU ??? you dont just get to not pick up after your dog cuz you're out on a walk
[2:57:54] LuciFeariUm: The poop technicians
[2:57:59] twootten: i believe they're called shitsmen
[2:58:02] Gojoro9: i own a dog daycare in houston
[2:58:09] Fray24_: I have six dogs and there is def a lot of poop
[2:58:12] itsCelivan: that's some bougie shit
[2:58:16] gmacster_: shitters is the technical term though
[2:58:18] Toketems: Toketems subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! yo my guy
[2:58:28] ShaggySummers: I would never let my dog shit in our yard...
[2:58:29] icculus86: Maybe?
[2:58:30] Shishikura: oh you mean the stool engineers
[2:58:31] BrainseekerEU: @oneifbyland you do if you life anywhere near nature
[2:58:35] Chappypappy1: shoutout houston
[2:58:37] Alarius_: literally paying someone to pick up your shit
[2:58:42] Chro_: Hypothetically do you think they'd be able to differentiate between human shit and dog shit asking for a friend obviously
[2:58:58] Squats3: my mom has 5 dogs... might have to find a service near her
[2:59:03] Karenius: that sounds depressing as fuck
[2:59:04] Slapsstick: @Chrolol who knows, ask amber heard
[2:59:08] majestictaco0: 12$ a time twice a week is 80 a month though
[2:59:15] Verothe3rd: do they offer any guarantees about getting ALL the poop? What if they find non-canine feces?
[2:59:17] oneifbyland: @BrainseekerEU I do, and if you do that you're kinda of an ass. Some places put up signs but even if they don't it's the proper etiquette
[2:59:25] Alarius_: paying someone to pickup your shit is textbook bougie
[2:59:35] RoflstompaSix: rhat do they do with the poop?
[2:59:40] Chro_: @Chrolol I can pay Amber Heard to come and clean up the shit in my yard? What a time to live
[2:59:41] ShaggySummers: 1 yard in 6 minutes? o.O
[2:59:43] kelly_mac06: it's so worth it, who wants to pick up shit
[2:59:48] LionButLeon: KEKW
[2:59:49] itsCelivan: best not to think about it
[2:59:50] chris_0verkill: are you gaming today @maximum what’s on the agenda
[2:59:52] cauliflowered: Could compost it
[2:59:52] gmacster_: they make fertilizer
[2:59:54] Pubscrub: eat it, save on groceries
[2:59:57] Cakerinotv: they give it to the poop deli
[2:59:59] healyouup: sell it to fertilizer for even  more $$
[2:59:59] cauliflowered: Then you have ANOTHER business
[2:59:59] twootten: what if they're sellin it to a compost company
[3:00:05] logicaltty: double dipping
[3:00:07] cornygerman: double dipping with the fertilizer
[3:00:09] Suited_Monkey: you don't fertilize dog poop ho?
[3:00:11] flabstv: Maybe they cook it
[3:00:13] BrainseekerEU: @oneifbyland wut? the forrest close to my place 100's of people walk their dog and no1 picks it up
[3:00:14] Aldewin25: @RoflstompaSix its there dinner. cos its so cheep they need some food

[3:00:16] logicaltty: i'll invest
[3:00:16] nellfin: dog poop is bad fertilizer
[3:00:16] ShaggySummers: dog poop is poison for farming @Maximum
[3:00:16] Cakerinotv: what about the poop deli's?

[3:00:51] Worldwid_e: Team Not so Liquid :X
[3:00:52] goblingher: "Max Liquid"
[3:00:53] logicaltty: poop bags with your face on them
[3:00:56] SerasVallo: @Maximum deal, but the logo has to be one of your awkward video thumbnail pictures
[3:00:57] lurk_e: that will be the logo
[3:00:57] Toketems: YEP POOP
[3:00:57] Karenius: HAH poop face
[3:00:58] Chro_: If you need poop to be scooped you obviously trust that famous guy from that video game with the responsibility
[3:01:01] PseudoZ: I have always thought of poop cleanup when i see your stream
[3:01:03] Whitemamba236: "world first raid leader turned poop grabber"
[3:01:04] Slay4daysKappa: Liquid poop service HAH

[3:01:08] mclustnbust: whats up my guy

[3:01:33] murloc_kingkiller: ^^^^^^^^^^
[3:01:36] itsCelivan: I don't think I could digest socks either to be fair
[3:01:36] holdenwook: I think they only make fertilizer from herbivore poop
[3:01:45] Squats3: @Maximum what unholy shit is happening with yalls feet that causes your dogs to want to eat socks
[3:01:49] flabstv: Do you clean the socks and reuse them
[3:01:53] gunshinsora: why did i join and hear eat socks?
[3:01:53] LuciFeariUm: Imagine being able to digest a sock could NOT be me
[3:01:55] ronpearlman: !drops

[3:02:16] StanRaenslen: thats what washing machines are for
[3:02:18] Suited_Monkey: On my head
[3:02:19] Rev3rendBilly: Probably gonna end up sounding like an ass, but keeping a dog in your backyard for the most part with minimal extracirricular stimuli that different type of walks provide is not the best practice for their well being. Unfortunately, daycare once per week to interact with other dogs and “infrequent” park walks is “minimal”.
[3:02:21] ThisIzD: that sock goes to the shadow realm
[3:02:23] LuciFeariUm: Weird flex
[3:02:25] Scarrboros: cook it into sock stew

[3:02:41] Oracle_WoW: liquid money
[3:02:43] fdb33: max not wearing poop socks WHAT U THINK UR BETTER THAN ME?????
[3:02:43] BrainseekerEU: poor sock, what about the other of the pair?
[3:02:47] thecajuncommie: @Maximum omg, saying that not cleaning a poopsock isnt boujee is fucking hilarious
[3:02:48] lezugg: @Maximum My 6 month Aussiedoodle took a week to puke back up an ear he ate off a stuffed animal. The size of a baby sock
[3:02:49] Vandoran01: yea its no longer a sock, more of a fiber supplement at the point
[3:02:52] Stubblelad: lucky sock
[3:02:52] PseudoZ: sock privlage

[3:03:12] LionButLeon: PogO
[3:03:17] oneifbyland: KKona Clap

[3:04:59] thecajuncommie: T swift rules
[3:04:59] mycho_: it's overblown tbh, they dont show her that much
[3:05:01] merzicdh: the true match up is eminem vs swift
[3:05:04] PseudoZ: how dope would a Taylor Swift vs Eminem superbowl be tho?!?!?!?!
[3:05:08] highcard2: ppl complain about it so damn much its wild
[3:05:17] drumminbacon: @mycho_ counted last game. it was 19 times
