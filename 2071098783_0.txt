[1:34:37] shugguls: @So_Much_Zest most
[1:36:07] krome2dadome: i started macroing it into some of em and it actually does just straight up prevent knockbacks sometimes
[1:36:10] krome2dadome: pretty op
[1:36:28] krome2dadome: felt weird macroed to chaos strike
[1:36:45] krome2dadome: so i didnt do that one
[1:37:01] So_Much_Zest: i saw some people macro it to blade dance
[1:37:08] So_Much_Zest: jellybeans :p
[1:37:22] shugguls: nope , only map it felt awkward on was the coffin map

[1:37:55] StreamElements: 35:28:01 notmes: 59 subs holy fawk!
[1:38:45] frostgodxeek: @shugguls what if u set up the secondary action bar to a completely different set of abilities but without the macro, and u swap action bar to that one when u get ruins
[1:38:58] frostgodxeek: like u know how u can change ur main actionbar to another one
[1:39:12] ImHomegr0wn: WOWERS
[1:39:27] frostgodxeek: as long as all ur rotation abilities are on the main bar that might work
[1:40:00] shugguls: @frostgodxeek it was easy to manage so i wouldnt change anything
[1:40:35] ImHomegr0wn: the 2nd bar is a good idea tho
[1:40:41] frostgodxeek: i see
[1:40:44] cixelp: Looking at cdew's bars on dh is so funny because I'm just used to his ui having all those rows full
[1:41:36] weckso: do shuffles pop instantly now?
[1:41:58] cixelp: I could be making this up but I feel like they made the healer in DPS MMR diff more lenient on Tuesday
[1:41:59] weckso: or only if you're in AWC?
[1:42:40] cixelp: So queued are a bit faster but it's more common to have and MMR mismatch between healers and DPS
[1:42:56] cixelp: but I could just be imagining it
[1:44:38] cixelp: I suck at typing rn 🤡

[2:52:44] meowmeow03278: yea using essence break w/o demonform is very less dmg
[2:53:44] Shablagoosh: That’s what I figured ty
[2:54:26] chiseledbrain: ret too strong: nerfed within a fortnight. meanwhile dh:

[3:02:17] Drathimos: the dh pvp talent chaotic imprint is what needs nerf. it gives the dh itself like 20% more dmg while also sometimes buffing teammates
[3:03:00] Jahthousandaire: nerf cyclone thats the problem
[3:03:01] Adeissss: wow players will never be content
[3:03:04] Shablagoosh: They’re really oppressive in the mythic plus scene too. Probably could nerf damage overall by 15% and they would still be good
[3:03:18] avenueone: wows always been like that
[3:03:19] al_capow: tbd to season 1 when ret pallys had their week of glory and won every single duo
[3:03:39] krome2dadome: nerf warrior.
[3:03:41] dankNstein_: @Shablagoosh they are worse than outlaw, ret, mage, and sp in m+ tbh
[3:03:51] Amnonongus: The video game is by far in the best state its ever been in 100%
[3:03:52] Amnonongus: 10000000%
[3:04:00] ilikegoldfishes: 4 ret lobbies
[3:04:04] Jahthousandaire: im f'ed i enjoy affliction D:
[3:04:10] tichoka: I mean, cant you do a type of "striking" like every pro not signing up for AWC, in hope they will add some actual PVP devs etc?
[3:04:17] Drathimos: ret was playing with next expac gear
[3:04:23] Amnonongus: 10.0.7 ret was infinitely better htan anythnig that ever hjappened in BFA
[3:04:32] tichoka: But it can turn out bad, i feel like if you guys do it they will just cancel whole AWC thingy
[3:04:36] Amnonongus: you couldn't even play the video game in BFA
[3:04:59] Amnonongus: The fact that the game is accessible makes it 10000000 btter than any previous version of the game all balance aside
[3:04:59] knadam13: dh needs a nerf to blur and that would probably do it
[3:05:09] wowsuomi: Nivda from 643 to 805 less then 2 days
[3:05:10] Drathimos: being happy = get bored quicker and unsub. being unhappy = leave people with hope that it'll get better and string them along for longer LUL
[3:05:38] avenueone: so when u start making youtube videos mes
[3:05:42] avenueone: complain and be negative

[3:06:36] atoker: if they nerf dh everyone that has one will be sad
[3:06:36] krome2dadome: i've never been happier than playing dh instead of warrior rn
[3:06:39] Drathimos: df gave us solo q, easy gearing, a lot more balance changes and ppl still complain
[3:06:42] tichoka: I mean, cant you pros deny playing the tournies until actual pvp devs are hired?
[3:07:05] tichoka: @Drathimos There was no changes since dec 12
[3:07:05] knadam13: its a problem when healers are dying more in shuffle than dh
[3:07:58] macciforum: @knadam13 why? i think healer should be a valid target
[3:08:20] knadam13: @macciforum because they can heal
[3:08:26] Drathimos: @tichoka thats not true. we got a giant armor change patch at the end of jan
[3:08:36] wowsuomi: “Sony’s PS5 Pro is expected to launch later this year, ahead of GTA VI release” When’s gta come out?
[3:08:53] tichoka: Thats what u call great devs?
[3:09:18] krome2dadome: s/o Realz. r1 dev

[3:10:27] Devcomz: This season is kind of weird too it seems like there is more people aggravated in this second to last season compared to like the SL one or BFA one
[3:10:41] Devcomz: which might explain the cry for changes
[3:10:41] weckso: yeah, but this xpac they did rets
[3:11:10] al_capow: even sod has like weekly balance changes now lol
[3:11:11] dankNstein_: m+ dungeon tuning has been really bad this season
[3:11:23] dankNstein_: the only changes/fixes that happened for a long time was only because mdi
[3:11:25] Drathimos: i think the issue is that the meta gets solved really quickly which makes it get stagnated and make ppl want constant patches to shake it up. we need to revert back to rock paper scissor meta
[3:11:29] tichoka: Because PVE is not really meta dependant
[3:11:53] dankNstein_: last season was just god comp
[3:12:04] Devcomz: Shuffle is pandoras box
[3:12:11] dankNstein_: fire/sp/aug/bear
[3:12:18] tichoka: What i hate that ppl who cried for this shuffle shit doesnt actually play retail, or just havent logged in since season 1
[3:12:20] XDCodeman: i wish shuff never happend
[3:12:25] Drathimos: w/o rock paper scissor meta the meta will converge into whatever spec is overtuned and that gets discovered relatively quickly
[3:12:54] knadam13: the frequent changes that they are making are good, but they address the symptoms not the disease
[3:13:33] XDCodeman: i think another issue is SS inflation happens way faster than 2s-3s
[3:13:37] saddingtons: do you think the incentives need to be more accessible to  the general populace as opposed to the gladiator/rank 1 population?
[3:13:42] Devcomz: The thing is though I wish Blizzard had a middle ground with changes its either a Rocket launcher in nerfs or a slap on the wrist
[3:14:10] Devcomz: with everyone complaining I dont want DH to get the rocket launcher but also not a slap on the wrist a middle ground to where they are still viable
[3:14:28] tarzogg: i think a lot of people just complain for the sake of it, most of them dont reach 1800 rating in pvp or 20+ keys in pve, but just say stuff like it would matter to their progress
[3:14:32] blackpooh01: I think it could very well be related to the class setup, just like in Classic Furys will always be better at the end game so in here some classes will naturally outscale others

[3:15:28] Shablagoosh: its the same issue with pve where they only listened to world first raiders for a while and then they finally stopped recently, this expac mainly
[3:15:31] al_capow: I still think removing gearing and ilvl would make the pvp community healthier, you can have plenty of alternative incentives and rewards that don't serve as play gates
[3:16:03] krome2dadome: realistically, I don’t think the current game really has a meta. dh is good for sure. and it’s easy so a lot of people play it. but there are a LOT of very good comps out there right now that people can succeed on. but people are not playing pvp a lot rn so you don’t see all of these very good comps… former glads are stuck at 2.1. and everyone else is just shuffling
[3:16:35] Devcomz: You have to convince the shufflers to also play 3s and try to do LFG
[3:16:40] Devcomz: but not sure how that can be done
[3:17:07] Shablagoosh: yea with shuffle in the game ill never queue 3s again outside of gearing for shuffle lol
[3:17:07] gio_jitsu_: i sat in lfg for like 3 hours today while queing shuffle. its dead
[3:17:38] al_capow: I feel like wow pvp could benefit from clash tourneys, like weekend tourneys with 2's and 3's brackets for special awards/mogs
[3:17:42] Devcomz: I feel that 3s participation is going to get worse next expac I am seeing people say they are excited to be able to q Shuffle and Blitz
[3:17:44] DontDv8: the hardest part of that is for people to find either a solid team to queue for that mmr or randomly joining groups to try to climb is not easy for the 97%
[3:17:51] tichoka: But @notmes  why would pros need MMR inflation? You will be R1 anyway,
[3:18:33] potionirl: I swear if you make a thunderous stone that you get at legend which gives a different colorway/effect to the glad mount people would be incentivized to push both shuffle and 3s
[3:19:02] tichoka: MMR wont fix high rated q times, there is still the same 25-30 top rated players who play for r1s
[3:19:40] tichoka: It wont change the fact that the same players play top ladder for the last 10 years
[3:19:51] Devcomz: Compare that to shuffle where there is probably 100 times that amount
[3:20:12] HughJekok: low rated players cant find teammates, solos fixed that but broke that 3s bracket
[3:20:28] Devcomz: What reward could they give in 3s?
[3:20:29] tarzogg: @DontDv8 i think it is more of a people problem, most times i join some randoms, they just dont type anything - even a simple hello is often too much to ask for it - and then complain that they cant find people to play with more often^^
[3:20:31] Devcomz: to get people to play it
[3:21:19] HughJekok: @Devcomz the wow demo is super easy to please lol, titles, cosmetics, mounts for starters
[3:21:23] Moodven: so many crits
[3:21:56] wrech22: With these crit numbers, it looks like you playing a dungeon and do aoe KEKW
[3:22:16] Devcomz: The reward would have to be good enough to make them do LFG over the ease of queueing for Solo Shuffle or Solo RBGs next expac
[3:22:21] Devcomz: for 3s
[3:22:32] al_capow: it seems like when you look at the pvp activity, half the active characters are alts too lol
[3:22:43] blackpooh01: I have a question, do you think PvE set gear is needed in arenas?
[3:22:46] DontDv8: @tarzogg but after how many random group attempts does someone go "ok no one ever wants to commit to more than one session of team play, I'll just play with people until they leave" mentality
[3:22:55] HughJekok: you make the incentive worthwhile and people will find teammates in any bracket
[3:23:15] al_capow: remove pvp gearing and you'll get growth 100000%
[3:23:26] HughJekok: solos werent designed to cater to high rated players
[3:23:34] HughJekok: @al_capow 100000%
[3:23:43] Devcomz: The pvp gearing isnt even that bad compared to BFA and SL though kind of reminds me of WoD gearing
[3:24:08] Devcomz: yeah you have crafting but its imo not too hard to figure out
[3:24:22] Devcomz: only difficult thing is probably the lego for DKs war and rets

[3:24:38] HughJekok: yeah they were very lazy in their execution
[3:25:27] Devcomz: I remember sometime in 23 Blizzard tweeting shuffle was a success but unfort it did come as a much bigger cost to 3s than I thought it would
[3:25:44] Devcomz: Im torn cause I do like both 3s and Shuffle
[3:25:59] Devcomz: Wish one didnt demolish the others participation

[3:26:04] Shablagoosh: its just simply annoying to find people to play 3s in any capacity, easier to click 1 button and then play with randoms with no coms
[3:26:06] boqqu: well the problem with solo shuff is the Q time aswell, im like 2.1-2.2k 3 player and pushing for glad playing like 1-2 hours/day cus of dadlife, but if i go shuffle i get like maybe 2 q's /session so its like 100% worthless and i think thats the main issue why people just quit pvp tbh.
[3:26:31] tarzogg: @dontDv8 oh for sure a lot - but i personaly try to talk more to just maybe "motivate" a bit of conversation. since i tried that i had definitely a easier time to find more people that are willing to play more sessions :D
[3:26:48] HughJekok: i mean, the only way to counteract this without removing it is the make solo a nonrated bracket
[3:27:09] yourproblematicfave: so skirms?
[3:27:14] Devcomz: Yeah Shuffle q time are long for sure when my friends are not on I am stuck with it though cause at the times I am on LFG has nothing unfort when I look I am activiely looking in shuffle qs too
[3:27:19] ironpeepee: @boqqu Thats why i swapped to healer. 40 min q's to go 2-4 is so demoralizing
[3:27:33] HughJekok: solo skrims yep lol, unfortunately
[3:27:36] boqqu: they can keep rating but no cosmetic rewards or titles
[3:27:45] n0tDef1ned: i think just people quit wow in general, it's not wayy easyer in pve either, in order to do your 24s 25s ou struggle to find a group that is willing to stay, and with no shuffle you end up trinyg to find people for hours
[3:27:46] boqqu: or other titles
[3:28:03] Devcomz: @boqqu I think thats also a bad idea cause then people will just straight up quit too
[3:28:16] Devcomz: thats why I think adding additional rewards to 3s and not removing from shuffle is better
[3:28:18] boqqu: alot easier to get groups in PVE tho.
[3:28:24] Devcomz: show people they can play both
[3:28:34] HughJekok: yeah well the solutiuon isnt to address one problem only obviously
[3:28:50] Rapid_Shy: mes hen fdk return
[3:29:12] Nemenon: is the leggo actually good in pvp?
[3:29:35] DontDv8: @tarzogg dont get me wrong, being friendly and talking to people will deff make finding a team easier but its not a guarantee that you can find a consistant team to climb to glad with, like mes said, unless you are trying to get glad mounts you get the same rewards from all the other brackets without worrying as much about a team

[3:31:02] Shablagoosh: was chuck serious when he said you guys should try warlock fdk
[3:31:06] Shablagoosh: like an hour ago lol
[3:31:27] Anhak: KEKW
[3:31:44] boqqu: 30min in solo Q now, guess daughter soon wakes up and rip game :)
[3:32:03] Devcomz: You guys ever see Cars? I am going to give a Cars analogy here. That town he got stuck where he eventually made friends there and got the girl car. He put his headquarters and they put the exit off the Interstate so people didnt avoid it. The interstate is shuffle and the town is 3s. Put something really nice in 3s to make people exit off the shuffle interstate
[3:32:21] Devcomz: and do both
[3:32:25] yarth85: Was there any buffs to frost or unholy dk recently?
[3:32:34] Devcomz: I suck at analogies actually
[3:32:38] HughJekok: funny analogy but it works
[3:32:40] Devcomz: sounded good in my head
[3:32:58] HughJekok: its a step in the right direction, but its only the start
[3:33:05] Anhak: Kermit: Chuck said "i would love to play with mes d k its my favorite character to queue with right now." but then his stream died
[3:33:07] tarzogg: of course, but at least it is a start - and since i read a lot of complains about not finding a team i think its just this basic start that a lot people forget - rewards should come in some kind of form on top of that too in an ideal world :D
[3:33:10] DontDv8: someones baked rn thinking about cars
[3:33:16] HughJekok: knowing blizz theyll just remove skrims and give different titles for the bracket and pat themselves on the back LUL
[3:33:23] DontDv8: jk that was pretty good
[3:34:04] wowsuomi: The ai sounded more hype then normal
[3:34:24] markyc22: hey hows it going. interested in helping out my healer get to 1800, pretty close
[3:35:32] HughJekok: its a whole revamp at this point
[3:35:42] tichoka: I mean, ppl around 2.2-2.4k dont know how to improve from that level, and noone tells them, there is legit a few "new players" who get really good at the game
[3:35:46] HughJekok: completely
[3:36:01] HughJekok: you want knew players and keep current AND incentivize returning player ]
[3:36:39] HughJekok: new* sorry autocorrect

[4:25:11] Dopaminex: EU friend of mine says he thinks it counters RMD
[4:25:28] Dopaminex: but tbh in current meta imo RMD feels a lot sketchier than it did maybe a month ago
[4:26:45] cotherg: tell me why i came back 2 days ago from a leave of absence season 1 DF playing 3 dks and made a mage
[4:26:50] cotherg: when dh is doing this
[4:27:56] Dopaminex: surprisingly the biggest counter to RMD by a mile is dh ele
[4:28:54] Szain3: DinoDance
[4:29:12] yarth85: Hey Mes will you play a little bit of frost dk this stream please
[4:29:18] Dopaminex: i've played a lot of rmd and dh ele and i haven't seen anything that feels like a counter to dh ele yet
[4:29:24] Dopaminex: but i often just want to log off of mage when i log onto it
[4:29:51] Dopaminex: done really well with dh ele but haven't played it too much tho yet, so i'd take my opinion with a grain of salt
[4:29:51] yarth85: That would be amazing! Thanks!!

[8:13:44] crusadein: i will say it does sound really edgy, but who plays death knight and isnt edgelordmaxxing
[8:14:00] crusadein: @honsou2 everything is pve spec, pvp gets the crumbs and the aftermath
[8:14:18] honsou2: @crusadein right but it will still be sanlayn in pvp not rider
[8:14:37] crusadein: @honsou2 who knows, until the tree comes out can only speculate
[8:14:57] crusadein: and itll probably be something you switch on the fly
[8:15:00] honsou2: @crusadein thats correct this is based on your speculation that it gives mobility which is useless in pvp
