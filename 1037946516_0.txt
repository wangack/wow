[1:49:42] Moobot: @Failer91 Prepatch has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || TBC launch is on June 1st
[1:49:44] Biorrwolf: @badlebowski The trick is to intentionally say the wrong thing to get the right information. Assholes love correcting people
[1:49:49] Lutheria: Hey, Towelliee. What Blood Elf related class do you guys need for your guild? Trying to decide what to make.
[1:49:51] IndistusX: That’s not a wow thing that’s a video game thing
[1:49:51] TheUnknowing: only mmo that doesnt have crazy toxic people ive seen so far is ffxiv lol
[1:49:56] warrenny: @badlebowski Pricks are a minority most ppl are all. Right
[1:50:05] BadLebowski: I still love the game so far, it's just funny.  I do get the game is old so a lot of people are extremely experiences are almost surprised that new players exist.
[1:50:05] NovaSun84: I feel like that happens in any game unfortunately.  I'd suggest finding decent med-large pop guild to ask questions in BadLebowski
[1:50:08] swordart_19: Get some skin this is internet LUL
[1:50:13] Lokajin: you havent played the right servers in ff14 @TheUnknowing theres plenty of toxicity there lol
[1:50:18] CritcobainTV: I had some guy in trade chat raging because i told him the belt he was trying to sell people wasn't bis for twinks and he started harassing me in whispers KEKW
[1:50:20] Jacobo204: PvP has and always will be a toxic shithole
[1:50:35] TheUnknowing: Or do you mean i havent played the wrong servers @Lokajin Kappa
[1:50:37] Lokajin: @TheUnknowing play on any of the top raiding servers and its a toxic cesspool
[1:50:38] NovaSun84: BGs are amazing.  "I'm in T3 gear so obviously everyone else is shit at the game".
[1:50:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: i hope they all get suspended next Tuesday Kappa
[1:50:46] tacofury2: after ranking to r11 in classic, my ignore list was all people from bg's
[1:50:56] IianaDRK: imagine thinking tier 3 is hard to get KEKWlaugh
[1:50:57] onybear: People have forgotten it is a game...I  have played for  15 years and there has always been jerks, but overall most people are pretty cool
[1:51:04] TheUnknowing: @Lokajin I mean I play on gilgamesh and havent seen much but maybe im sheltered :P
[1:51:10] tbbex_: i just got my senior yearbook. Man, i sheded some tears

[1:52:40] NovaSun84: He tried to make a new /chat channel a week ago, didn't go well at all KEKW
[1:52:42] jerexify: Hey @Towelliee or chat, is questing the best way to grind gold before TBC launches? I'm on a boosted warrior, though, so I don't know if it would be worth it to dungeon grind for a combination of gear and gold, or just go for the gold via quests.
[1:52:45] Lokajin: @TheUnknowing definitely sheltered gilgamesh is hella toxic at the top end lol
[1:52:54] HunttheBleak: do you have a music player? or is this just spotify?
[1:53:14] swordart_19: @TBBEX_ lol release it  all !

[2:35:04] ArcaneSyntax: like mana stream usually isn't worth the mana to cast it
[2:35:04] 06DGR: @justiinntime really? Should give it another go man I absolutely love this keyboard I don’t think I’ll ever use another one again
[2:35:05] LNLdotGameNetwork: I wish I was good enough for a sponsorship.

[2:39:05] chumblyy: 3
[2:39:08] oldmangamer0: Yes 3
[2:39:22] King_Jmann: @DGRea_6 It was a solid board, I just personally couldn't deal with how sensitive the keys were. I rest my fingers on the keys and I end up pressing them, I'm thinking about ordering a Blackwidow V3 Tenkeyless though
[2:39:24] ArcaneSyntax: you'll more than have the honor by the time you get the marks

They moved it back to mid-Sept, and Convention Sunday is the same day as a Colts home game and the convention center and Lucas Oil stadium are right next to each other. Going to be a lot of fun to watch 50k nerds figure out that they cant park at the stadium this year.

[5:39:35] statsfluffer: thx zixxxs
[5:39:45] crawcook: Is it really about not showering or just having a lot of people in one place sweating in one place?
[5:39:58] Armdel: Horde doesn't play to win, horde plays for efficiency
[5:40:02] shortgoof: Quick question.. Is game time included with the dark portal pass? I have googled it and it says it does but i purchased it and no game time has been added.
[5:40:05] nolorand: wow weekend inc ready to make some gold
[5:40:05] crawcook: It's kinda meant to happen after hours of walking in a convention full of people.
