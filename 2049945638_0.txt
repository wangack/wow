[0:26:07] s7wede: There is an addon called Opie, it lets you create flyout rings from all sorts of items. toys, mounts and macros. I use it to manage all my teleports

[0:29:42] adampanerabread: the agi trinket from rag in here is super strong
[0:30:19] MediumRareOG: DF alpha was 4 months before release. SL alpha was 7 months. If we expect September TWW release that puts alpha at Feb to May
[0:30:50] MediumRareOG: DST and Chipped Soul Prism are common TW trinkets
[0:31:32] magemaster225: 2/6/22 is 30
[0:31:35] NateOliveiras: @MediumRareOG my thoughts exactly.
[0:31:51] s7wede: Have you seen the tradepost dates for the next dragonflight quest cycle? "Final Surge" starts on 23/2/2024
[0:32:21] MediumRareOG: @s7wede Final Surge is the last week of every month for the trading post
[0:33:45] MediumRareOG: Final Surge is extra activities the last week of th emonth to fill out your tendies bar
[0:34:19] amricatt: I noticed I filled "Final Surge" today.  Has it always been there?
[0:34:58] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[0:35:44] NeeK_23: they cant, its bugged, they wont be able to be healed by the opposite faction
[0:36:07] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM

[0:37:09] NeeK_23: an alliance healer couldnt heal a horde person if they join late
[0:38:06] amricatt: I thought tanks in same group was norm.  But I don't raid.
[0:38:09] NeeK_23: Dojo we try and work around it but its happened last 2 firelands raids
[0:38:10] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:38:15] MediumRareOG: Do we normally have Lunar Festival and Love is in the Air running at the same time?
[0:38:37] KaisenSiru: triFeels awkwFeelsbad
[0:38:48] physalis4: you still have enough. You can zerg it pretty much till the last boss
[0:38:49] SlithTheSivak: "my cat just puked"
[0:38:54] Layliah79: If only those spots could be filled with AI players! they wouldn't leave!
[0:39:06] s7wede: people think timewalking raids are like normal and we oneshot everything
[0:40:00] NeeK_23: pretty much yeah
[0:40:27] KaisenSiru: Deadge
[0:40:37] BBMezzy: I hope so, otherwise it might be another 2 weeks.. doubt they'd want to share the hype with SoD phase 2 release
[0:40:43] NateOliveiras: I have a suspicion they were going to announce it last week but then the whole layoff thing happened and then decided to postpone it
[0:40:53] Turet78: I would love some pirate news
[0:41:46] NateOliveiras: Imagine if they just drop the patch without PTR or anything. I'd me epic
[0:42:05] Turet78: One crazy take I saw is we get a customizable ship that would be a dream coming true
[0:42:30] physalis4: I don't think there are enough devs still working on DF to do something super crazy
[0:42:41] SlithTheSivak: if they put in boat fishing like archeage had id be happy forever
[0:42:59] NateOliveiras: I hope it's something lore driven, probably involving pirates having a lead where the Isle of Dorn is located
[0:43:08] physalis4: I think people need to curb expectations for the rest of the year until TWW
[0:43:58] adampanerabread: If they dropped the patch without PTR testing it'd have to be a global release right?
[0:44:20] Turet78: if I remeber right the wow team is curretly working 3 different expacs at the same time: DF patches, War Within, Midnight prepatch content

[0:45:45] NeeK_23: any cata ones, inc dragons soul
[0:46:05] Ace_Trekkie: I saw that one of the Trading Post activities requires the D.I.S.C.O toy and the Goblin Gumbo Toy. Both TCG items, seems a bit niche. We got the D.I.S.C.O toy as twitch drop...do you think we will get the Goblin Gumbo as a future Twitch drop ?
[0:46:10] IntrpdMuppet: which box for mounts sorry?
[0:46:21] floorsimTV: i got invincible from the wotlk box
[0:46:31] Ace_Trekkie: in classic
[0:46:34] Turet78: the build number is quite odd too 10.2.6 not .7 the number suggest small patch but the teasing and the silence is weird
[0:46:38] floorsimTV: doing alright how are you?
[0:47:01] Dr4gonMouse: just did firelands on my druid while farming for mounts and got the pureblood firehawk from rag :D
[0:47:20] KaisenSiru: HahaSweat HahaSweat
[0:48:21] KaisenSiru: The purpose is to steer him with the legs to avoid him reaching the lava or he'll drink it and do aoe damage
[0:48:27] CardinalTX: Focus the third leg
[0:48:50] KaisenSiru: and to crush the volcanos to remove them from the fight
[0:49:50] KaisenSiru: Well mentally that was when that would kill you on Heroic when Cata was current :P
[0:49:58] KaisenSiru: TWing you can just heal through
[0:50:15] KaisenSiru: the volcanos just spew aoe damage
[0:50:31] KaisenSiru: and sounds about right, on part with Normal
[0:51:38] Turet78: Amirdrassil norm is quite easy but if you ignore the mechanics you still can wipe from oneshots here you can ignore almost everything and you still kill it
[0:52:07] Layliah79: when is BFA TW
[0:52:20] Layliah79: we should get it during this expansion right?
[0:52:28] Jamertamer: SoO gear was datamined for mop timewalking
[0:52:43] Xesol: they should just skip pandaria and go to blackrock foundry
[0:53:16] Xesol: that would be cool
[0:53:23] yuldovah42: do you have your heart of Azeroth on?
[0:53:36] Layliah79: heroic timewalking raids should be what S4 is :D
[0:53:49] Turet78: Now we running through the timewalkings so maybe we have to walk in the pandamonium timerunning
[0:53:50] Layliah79: should be
[0:53:55] invictus_DK: why heart of azeroth?
[0:54:26] yuldovah42: no
[0:54:29] Layliah79: it's what i would prefer for a S4 compared to what we get now

[0:55:46] Big_Rum: I got somthing just now called breathof the dream.. it adds visual effects to gear? Not sure how to use it though
[0:55:50] Turet78: the devs teased some extra for season 4 honestly can't imagine what they planning beside affix raid and maybe affix free dungeons scaled up (personal wish)
[0:56:20] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:56:22] Big_Rum: 2500 mythic +
[0:56:26] NeeK_23: KSH?
[0:56:55] Big_Rum: I got a 20 rise if ya want to do it later
[0:56:55] NeeK_23: yeah extra effects on tiet shoulders/head
[0:57:11] Xesol: friends keep asking me to m+, my rating is exactly 2500, see ya next season lol
[0:57:16] Turet78: yep you get the mythic effect on the lower difficulty shoulders and helmets if you can't see it just relog
[0:57:50] Xesol: i think i only did 1 20, you can get the rating if you spam 18s its pretty quick
[0:58:01] Big_Rum: I just timed a 19 there
[0:58:10] Layliah79: if you stay together and kite the spiders as a group it's A LOT easier.
[0:58:10] physalis4: you'd get KSH
[0:58:12] NeeK_23: all 13s over 2 weeks
[0:58:32] Zuldak: KSM is mostly 13s  now
[0:58:38] physalis4: It is for KSM. But you said all 20s which would get you KSM and KSH
[0:58:50] Zuldak: 15 was in S:
[0:58:50] NateOliveiras: Atal dazar tyrannical +22 was the last key I timed this season over a month ago. That was enough for the season. Too traumatic
[0:58:51] Zuldak: SL
[0:59:21] NeeK_23: Yazma is painful
[0:59:33] physalis4: You'd probably have to do some on the other affix, but getting all 20s on one would put you in a good spot for KSH
[0:59:54] Zuldak: go through rings
[1:00:41] Turet78: key inflation is real last season I reached 2790 now I'm at 3150 with timed 24-25 keys not a pushover but can't imagine my team could do it last season
[1:00:53] CrowMomocle: feathers come down when boss is in the air
[1:01:32] CrowMomocle: he does enrage eventually
[1:02:15] Turet78: baby birds fixates to the closest player like a newborn
[1:02:40] NeeK_23: need to grind waking shore mats for the pet
[1:02:45] Jamertamer: thats it, rhere is a few step for it and that firelands thing is part of it
[1:03:39] Big_Rum: its crazy im 2507 M+ and 480 ilevel; and can't get invited in LFG
[1:04:08] Big_Rum: yup
[1:04:14] physalis4: haha

[1:17:35] Zuldak: Mork and Mindy is a very old reference
[1:17:48] Forgiven78: Sitcom

[1:25:48] Lestatis: I bo-lieve
[1:25:51] physalis4: mount time baby
[1:25:57] Big_Rum: how did you get there so quick?
[1:26:02] NeeK_23: raid leading by text and pings is 100% more stressful
[1:26:15] physalis4: solid upgrade tho
[1:26:26] s7wede: Thanks for the raid
[1:26:46] Zuldak: if you do 16s you can grind out 483 ilvl gear
[1:26:49] Windelius: is this ptr ?
[1:26:52] Zuldak: aspect crests drop on 16s
[1:27:30] NeeK_23: no mount, just a pet, sadge
[1:28:07] Windelius: damn u can dragonride in stormwind now ?!
[1:28:10] NeeK_23: i already have 3 of the pet, its just vendor trash
[1:28:10] Dunkurk: wow could do with having the ff14 "Equip best in slot" button
[1:28:21] illidari_Neeko: Hey @mrgm üëãüèºüëãüèºüëãüèº
[1:28:28] Lausten: @Windelius You can dragonride anywhere you can fly
[1:28:36] NeeK_23: wow gear doesnt work like that
[1:28:41] Xesol: that would be tough to do because of secondary stats
[1:29:04] s7wede: I got the pet from the Dragonsoul raid. I have completed that raid every week for the last 6 years in hopes of the drake mount to complete Awake the Drakes achievement. Not happy
[1:30:00] Lakatarmen: You could sim it urself and then make a equipment set so u can easily swap gearsets, got that with speedset and m+ set
[1:30:15] ratgefingah: did you finish the tw raid quest yet? I got the ragnaros mount from the cache 2day

[1:31:22] MediumRareOG: The sucky thing about Dragon Soul is there are 3 mounts. You get 2 of them and you still have to run the raid every week
[1:31:27] Xesol: found you get a ton if you pug a raid or two
[1:31:43] Xesol: i want to say its like 45 per boss
[1:31:43] MediumRareOG: Emerald Dream weeklies are a good source of flight stones

[1:37:10] lirly__: the 2 seater rocket mount is 100 tenders on NA , is that a bug lol?
[1:37:11] physalis4: so clean
[1:37:38] MediumRareOG: oh the rocket is 2 seater? nice
[1:37:43] BBMezzy: One of the love bug pets was also 100 tenders cheaper than originally announced
[1:37:45] Lausten: @lirly__ We are celebrating 1 year of Trading Post
[1:37:50] BBMezzy: Hope they stay in this range of pricing
[1:38:01] Lausten: Cant believe its been a year already
[1:38:51] chelfx: truuuue rocket mount is a skill-based reward

[1:38:59] chelfx: 10.0.5
[1:39:04] NeeK_23: btw if you wanted to clear normal Amirdrassil, what time would be a good start for you? Should take about an hour? Would be Sunday if interested
[1:39:45] Lausten: Just do like Preach did the other day, he made a 30 man raid the other day and we one shot it all
[1:39:50] NeeK_23: ok no worries. I know Dojo is too early normally.
[1:40:01] Lausten: We speed ran it
[1:40:07] NeeK_23: @Lausten you were there too? I was healing it
[1:40:27] Lausten: I got 5 mogs + the hearthstone :D @NeeK_23

[1:40:59] Xesol: in the same boat, it only gets worse as they get older lol
[1:41:38] Lausten: Thats what alcohol on the pacifier was for wasnt it back in the day lol
[1:42:44] Lausten: Are they doing keys?
[1:43:03] Lausten: Cause lately I've noticed that Collecting streams have been getting more views
[1:43:04] Xesol: you have all the collectors watching - the group is large
[1:43:09] Zuldak: I feel like keys and pvp are highly volatile
[1:43:14] NeeK_23: Rage's schedule seems inconsistent imo, having a fixed schedule really helps views/growth
[1:43:25] JakeSezz: I mean, there‚Äôs probably a load of factors that go into that though: what content? how are the presenting it? do they seem bored? like there‚Äôs too many factors that may play into it
[1:43:31] Wynem: might be the content, i dont watch people doing keys or pvp
[1:43:36] Iwony: you just do chill content...
[1:43:41] feelsincrediblysadman: ive watched you from as far back as when you used to review p servers :D
[1:43:44] s7wede: Casual and Collectors are wows largest demographic. Only a very small niche are interested in M+
[1:44:04] Lausten: Collecting streams are chill and proper conversation where as M+ streams are all about emote spams..

[1:54:18] physalis4: I think it's kinda funny the movie Pinocchio came out in Feb 1940 and we get a wooden doll toy in Feb
[1:54:36] Ace_Trekkie: emotes like /dance work on the mannequin though
[1:54:49] physalis4: I doubt it. Just a weird coincidence
[1:54:50] s7wede: best is flex
[1:54:57] Iwony: no they said it was for the one year trading post celebration or sothing
[1:55:07] SlithTheSivak: the 1980 movie Mannequin also came out in February...

[1:56:47] BBMezzy: 15 days after launch.. but glad to have it done now
[1:56:48] chelfx: it is not
[1:56:51] Iwony: √Æt was not
[1:56:52] Jamertamer: nope
[1:56:52] Big_Rum: The need to change the proffesions knowledge that you loot to account wide. I have like 75 extra knowledge thats is useless
[1:56:57] Zuldak: i wish they would hotfix the buggy thigns to do like the weeds not spawning in
[1:56:58] physalis4: This archive event confuses me. Some stuff rewards the currency, and there's another part w/ a ton of dailies
[1:57:00] Iwony: no idea why
[1:57:09] JakeSezz: Hey Mannequin is my SHIT! I loved that movie back in the day. Between Kim Cattrall, Nicole Kidman, and Reba McEntire, there‚Äôs no wonder redheads are my kryptonite mrgmL mrgmL
[1:57:20] chelfx: Wowhead did a on the hat it was like "New hat has been discovered" lol
[1:57:44] chelfx: article
[1:57:50] Lausten: Its as if the Archive event was meant to be in from the beginning but wasnt finished so they just added it now but half finished
[1:58:09] Sauc3ry: just logged into a really old character and found a deckhands shirt :D
[1:58:28] Lakatarmen: daaamn, thats alot of gold
[1:58:31] chelfx: its a shirt that cost 500kg
[1:58:40] Lausten: @Sauc3ry ü§ë
[1:58:54] Xesol: isnt it like a .1% drop from the pirates in barrens now?
[1:59:02] JellybeanBlues: random drop from pirates in barrens
[1:59:46] Sauc3ry: miserable item to farm apparently from the comments on wowhead, I guess there's just a few pirates that can drop it on a long respawn
[2:00:10] Lausten: Forbidden Reach and some of the pet battle quests that was added in the later patches
[2:00:14] Iwony: new instance ^^
[2:00:36] NeeK_23: more tomes if less people at least
[2:00:56] Lausten: Ah yeah any that involves the Dracthyr.. Yeah the tabard need that rep buff like the other factions
[2:01:44] chelfx: i got like 6 tombs when it was me and couple other people
[2:01:45] Big_Rum: Snow white!
[2:02:11] Big_Rum: I hope they keep pushing LA Knight
[2:03:32] Layliah79: bugs in them :(
[2:03:33] physalis4: heh, I didn't get a recruit a friend achievement for the rocket mount
[2:03:34] chelfx: To make it seem like they had done more than they did
[2:03:39] NeeK_23: at least I only need to do them for the achievement and not the rep
[2:03:49] BBMezzy: Didn't they hype the archives as a way to tell more lore? There's been almost none of that
[2:04:21] NeeK_23: are the tomes double spaced and font 12 to pad out the content /s
[2:04:29] chelfx: Dragonflight alpha was pretty compete
[2:04:30] BBMezzy: First Alpha is going to be more complete than 10.2.5 :p

[2:04:43] NeeK_23: yeah but its a book in the HQ
[2:04:48] Iwony: I thought there would be some small lore to it but NAH!
[2:05:01] chelfx: the Alpha really felt like a beta
[2:05:19] s7wede: There isn't anything worth reading at any rank
[2:05:27] NeeK_23: each week you add to the book. check your achievements and you'll have some % prog on it
[2:05:30] Jamertamer: idk how blizzard managed to make the boringest event, the grindest DF event.
[2:05:32] chelfx: the zones where empty of npcs but that is pretty easy to fill
[2:06:01] s7wede: At least I'm done with it apart from 6 WQ's a week for the last achievement

[2:07:13] Ace_Trekkie: you can do 4 or 5 digs at a dig pile then move to another and still get the fragments from them
[2:07:15] BBMezzy: It can
[2:07:20] SlithTheSivak: i got the hat from a purple book
[2:07:21] taldras: Some people got it from the dragon according to WoWhead
[2:07:24] BBMezzy: Dragon drops tome items
[2:07:58] Lausten: Too many cooks
[2:07:58] taldras: Probs nobody at Blizz thought of it
[2:08:11] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:08:18] BBMezzy: It's great but it needs an overhaul
[2:08:41] taldras: Weird thing is, there are "sets" that are random greys from vanilla but some sets from Legion onwards aren't there
[2:09:17] BBMezzy: The crappy DF color shoulder+ tabard "sets" should not be in the same list as full sets
[2:09:21] Big_Rum: yup last week i got the mount
[2:10:35] NeeK_23: tw is its own instance I believe
[2:10:48] MediumRareOG: TW, Heroic and Normal Firelands are all separate lockouts
[2:11:40] MediumRareOG: Avengers of Hyjal is one of those reps where trash only gives rep up to like honored or revered
[2:11:51] JellybeanBlues: two mounts from FL

[2:12:04] syriusdots: mounts
[2:12:14] MediumRareOG: Alysrazor and Ragnaros drop mounts
[2:12:15] Xesol: technically the meta achievement too right?
[2:12:59] MediumRareOG: That might be a good video when the alpha launches and you have video of the dragonriding
[2:13:03] Sauc3ry: what is your att completion % ?
[2:13:10] taldras: Is there a list of all mounts with dragonriding animations?
[2:13:24] JakeSezz: The fire hawk from the Glory cheev is lowkey one of my favorites
[2:13:57] legendarism: if u pick the feather and fly there u can go straight to ragnaros
[2:14:04] legendarism: i told u one of my wow secretsd
[2:14:08] Lausten: @Sauc3ry Depends on settings
[2:14:20] Iwony: I am still working on scroll hunter achievement for Forbidden Reach meta :/
[2:14:50] Iwony: no 50 scrolls to get
[2:14:53] Iwony: takes ages
[2:14:58] JakeSezz: @legendarism I just saw a YT short for that go around and it pissed me off I didn‚Äôt know about it before üòÇ
[2:15:01] Iwony: 35/50 I am now....
[2:15:17] Lausten: You can get the buff item that increase your rate of getting them
[2:15:36] Basilwheat: there was a bug abuse at the start with that achievement where u could get double the credit if double clicked it
[2:15:50] Basilwheat: YEP

[2:50:10] Lakatarmen: I put my vote on Goldshire inn (RP)
[2:50:26] Zuldak: You could throw a Dan-con and only invite people named Dan
[2:50:37] CrowMomocle: Have someone make some cool LFG badges as well
[2:50:41] RAF_Sean: Already bought my plane tickets. We're fucking going bruv

[2:50:58] Big_Rum: I was kidding
[2:51:01] Dunkurk: Solo Shuffle
[2:51:03] Runechaos: Wasn't there an event like that before? Someone inviting people with his name and the fought for who gets to keep it
[2:51:09] chelfx: you need a Ball Pit in a empty room
[2:51:13] taldras: Tanacon 2.0 üòÇ
[2:51:21] NeeK_23: Dancon is too close to Dashcon. If you know you know. Can we get a ball pool?
[2:51:31] RAF_Sean: What if we call it Fyre 2.0
[2:51:53] Zuldak: oh no no no... do not look up dashcon. That is a cursed story
[2:52:16] NeeK_23: Dashcon was what happens to failed planning
[2:52:32] Dunkurk: it was so much worse than nothing to do
[2:52:42] NeeK_23: Cham wont allow it
[2:52:49] Dunkurk: they spent the latter half of the day raising funds from the audiance to keep the con on
[2:52:52] Lausten: Theres a bouncing castle, could go so many ways
[2:52:59] Phenroi: Portal will open shortly for next boss

[2:53:14] Zuldak: It's almost as bad as Rainfurrest
[2:53:26] RAF_Sean: I've helped organize a few community driven in person events before if you want a hand (or don't already have it covered)
[2:53:32] thunduz: and he ignores me, where is my refund button
[2:53:48] thunduz: and then leaves...I feel seen

[2:54:27] Vunderbrat: We see you thunduz!

[2:57:36] thunduz: those shoulder's are so cool
[2:57:36] Dunkurk: sick mount, as in it makes you feel sick looking at it
[2:57:47] Phenroi: 3 total mounts can be dropped in this raid
[2:58:00] khalcrux_gaming: needed a skip lol
[2:58:04] RAF_Sean: Big same
[2:58:16] RAF_Sean: I'll go through and put together outfit and save them but never wear them
[2:58:27] Dunkurk: 2 recolouts from Madness
[2:58:30] Dunkurk: 1 hc one normal
[2:58:34] BBMezzy: It's all for the trial of style
[2:58:34] Lakatarmen: its two from madness
[2:58:35] chelfx: go to heroic
[2:58:45] Vidaloo: 2 on madness, 1 on ultraxion
[2:58:51] homie_rendy: gg
[2:59:04] Vidaloo: I got lucky and got all 3 in 5 resets
[2:59:25] Twebbles_: Is 10.2.6 news confirmed to be today?
[2:59:26] Vidaloo: Farming on 5 characters tho
[2:59:37] Twebbles_: Sadge
[2:59:43] chelfx: huffing the hope and cope
[2:59:52] khalcrux_gaming: Fergie
[2:59:56] Lausten: Hes got insider knowledge but hes playing it cool Kappa
[3:00:00] Priory: i felt the same last week

[3:00:07] RAF_Sean: I heard they cancelled 10.2.6 because of your tweet
[3:00:30] chelfx: i heard the new blizzard president follows in him on twitter

[3:03:40] Etaranel: Dragon soul solo? mrgmS
[3:04:09] Vidaloo: Yup
[3:04:15] MediumRareOG: DBM tells you when you could move
[3:04:18] Dunkurk: do you not stil have to step from side to side
[3:04:19] khalcrux_gaming: The relic was compared to the dragon soul. Are they gonna try and blast the titans? You think the relec will stick around till the last titan?
[3:04:22] chelfx: can he still flip?
[3:04:23] Vidaloo: Just make sure to kill them close to the carapace
[3:04:25] Phenroi: You still have to do mechanics for the spine, which makes it awful
[3:04:37] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[3:04:47] khalcrux_gaming: Ya that one
[3:05:02] Phenroi: There's an easy way to do it with minimal moving
[3:05:02] khalcrux_gaming: You gotta keep going left and right
[3:05:07] RAF_Sean: Adored it
[3:05:10] MediumRareOG: You kill all but 1 tentacle next to the spine, wait for 8 blobs, kill the blobs next to the carapace, kill the tentacle to spawn the thing, flip back and forth to stop from falling off
[3:05:12] RAF_Sean: Not what you expect
[3:05:14] ImperfectDark: it's weird but i found it entertaining
[3:05:14] khalcrux_gaming: No but I want to'
[3:05:34] chelfx: you should try spinning that's a good trick
[3:05:34] Wynem: its wierd but good
[3:05:43] ImperfectDark: it's not AMAZING. It's grand, like. lol
[3:05:47] Sauc3ry: saltburn?> lmao   it was funny to laugh about while watching it with friends because of oh wierd/cringe/creepy it was
[3:05:49] Iwony: Sophie Ellis Bexter did something new?  or is it the song from the 2000s
[3:06:07] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:06:16] khalcrux_gaming: Kill all the blobs by the armor piece
[3:06:21] Iwony: Ah! I had her whole album back then ^^
[3:06:28] ratgefingah: does anyone know what happened to obsidian citadel rares? they dont seem to spawn at all
[3:06:32] Vidaloo: Yeah but few people dont know you can just afk in the holes while waiting for enough blobs, wait for a big add then kill the blobs until the big add becomes a nuke, then kill it close to the carapace
[3:06:35] Phenroi: kill all but 1 tentacle
[3:06:42] khalcrux_gaming: gotta keep moving across the spin every time the message goes off
[3:06:53] Phenroi: and stand in the empty tenacle spot
[3:06:55] Vidaloo: So basically you always need to keep 1 tentacule up to pop the big add
[3:06:56] MediumRareOG: if you stand on an empty tentacle spot you won't fall off
[3:07:02] Ironhide_Gaming: lol stand near the tentacle
[3:07:07] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies üß° https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[3:07:09] Etaranel: I watched a review of it by some bloke. He used the word bum a lot
[3:07:12] khalcrux_gaming: Kill all the tenticles to get all the blobs spawning kill all but one add
[3:07:13] Bain6969: STANDING ON A DEAD TENTACLE U WONT FALL OFF
[3:07:27] khalcrux_gaming: If he keeps spinning everything will get thrown off
[3:07:33] Ironhide_Gaming: yes it grabs you
[3:07:35] Phenroi: Then wait for all 9 blobs
[3:07:42] NateOliveiras: So this was the OG dragonriding raid
[3:07:56] MediumRareOG: It's going to be difficult to explain it in chat. you might want to watch a video
[3:07:57] Bain6969: u can either zigzag left and right sides of the spine.....he resets then
[3:07:58] khalcrux_gaming: See
[3:08:01] Ironhide_Gaming: but you need to kill the blobs so he walks through them
[3:08:09] Vidaloo: and that's why you keep the tentacule
[3:08:19] Phenroi: Once 9 blobs are out, take them to the spine and kill them then a tantacle
[3:08:22] khalcrux_gaming: Every time the message goes off move to the other side. It's annoying
[3:08:33] Vidaloo: Cause when you kill it, it pops the big add
[3:08:35] Vidaloo: yep
[3:08:53] Vidaloo: and just make it soak the blood on the floor left by the blob
[3:08:59] MediumRareOG: killing the tentacle spawns a guy, run him through the puddles left by the blobs so he has 8 stacks (9?), then kill him and he blows up
[3:09:17] khalcrux_gaming: Lead him there
[3:09:22] Phenroi: drag the npc through the blobs
[3:09:25] Cooperharley0204: this fight blows
[3:09:27] Ironhide_Gaming: lol this fight is still a mess
[3:09:34] Vidaloo: Nuke now
[3:09:35] khalcrux_gaming: Kill him
[3:09:38] Grissu_: kill the add now
[3:09:50] kpatt17: Then hit the thing under the amor
[3:10:05] Vidaloo: Yep, and now repeat twice
[3:10:06] Jamertamer: now do that 2 more times
[3:10:11] kpatt17: 3
[3:10:19] Phenroi: 3 total times
[3:10:19] MediumRareOG: e
[3:10:27] khalcrux_gaming: Yeah I quick kill this with no tenticles. If you know what you want and kill the other big guys instantly it goes quick
[3:11:38] Phenroi: You can reset the roll by going to the other side of him
[3:11:42] khalcrux_gaming: Now this is dragonriding!
[3:11:48] Jamertamer: lol
[3:11:57] JaviHeals: oh lord, this fight is bringing back trauma lmao!
[3:11:59] Basilwheat: forever
[3:12:05] Basilwheat: or well until you die KEKW
[3:12:08] khalcrux_gaming: Till they're picked up
[3:12:09] Vidaloo: Yeah you need to male it soak the firey bloods on the floor
[3:12:11] Vidaloo: forever
[3:12:19] JaviHeals: Progressing it was hell lol
[3:12:32] alicemch: hiiiiiiiii
[3:12:42] Phenroi: go back and forth to reset it fast
[3:12:54] khalcrux_gaming: Yeah then you go tot the other side when the roll message comes up
[3:13:24] JaviHeals: Yeah imagine it like a see-saw
[3:13:32] CrowMomocle: It was mega time consuming back in the day. It was infinitely harder than Deathwing himself.
[3:13:42] khalcrux_gaming: Not with how quick you reset the roll
[3:13:58] JaviHeals: @CrowMomocle 100% the proper "end" boss was really good!
[3:14:00] Vidaloo: once you got the gist of it it's okay, just tedious
[3:14:02] UlthraneDK: This was a guild breaker back in the day
[3:14:06] JaviHeals: Especially with each dragons buffs etc, really fun
[3:14:07] khalcrux_gaming: yeah
[3:14:11] Vidaloo: Yeah there will always be one
[3:14:26] Phenroi: If you kill all tentacles, they will respawn in a random location, which is why you leave 1 up, so you know where it is
[3:14:51] Vidaloo: But you need to stand in the hole of an empty one otherwise you will get thrown off
[3:14:52] Dunkurk: I main tanked this fight on heroic progression and was bored out my tree, whilst kex got to off tank it and run around feeling like god stacking blood and thunder up on all the slimes
[3:14:56] CrowMomocle: In the history of my playing WoW this was my most memorable progression.
[3:15:09] khalcrux_gaming: If you're quick you can kill all the tenticles kill all the big guys before the eat anything and you'll get tons of blobs
[3:15:10] Phenroi: I got it down to about 5-6 minutes when I was running it
[3:15:30] Phenroi: 9
[3:15:30] magemaster225: 9
[3:15:31] thunduz: I think 9
[3:15:31] ruof3: 9
[3:15:33] Vidaloo: 9
[3:15:36] kpatt17: He will get an orb around him
[3:15:37] khalcrux_gaming: You have enough lol
[3:15:43] thunduz: bye bye
[3:15:44] nuclearphosphate: ahoy
[3:15:48] Basilwheat: I just go left to right endlessly whenever I did this was the easiest for me + less anxious KEKW
[3:15:49] Jamertamer: lol Û†ÄÄ
[3:15:58] kpatt17: Gotta do the dance across the spine to
[3:15:59] snowyzoex: nooooo cleoooooo the condensationnnnn
[3:15:59] nuclearphosphate: i JUST got all the battle tank colours from my first pull in ahn qiraj LOL
[3:16:03] khalcrux_gaming: Yeah when you do that reset the roll then kill him
[3:16:06] UlthraneDK: Oi flyin bombs innit
[3:16:25] Basilwheat: yep
[3:16:34] Basilwheat: just keep waddling back and forth
[3:16:39] khalcrux_gaming: You don't need to do it so constantly but every few seconds
[3:16:46] witchhobbit: LUL
[3:16:54] dright424: sit in one of the scars until you have like 10 our 12 bloods then kill them and summon one of the elementals
[3:16:56] Dunkurk: have you got the achievment for madness already?
[3:17:02] UlthraneDK: Imagine sailing to Kalimdor and that thing lands on the deck of your ship
[3:17:03] Dunkurk: like the start on each platform one
[3:17:10] khalcrux_gaming: You know this one?
[3:17:13] nuclearphosphate: @MrGM i JUST got all the possible battle tank mount colours from ahn qiraj in my first pull LOL, ive got a friend who is STILL after the red one so thats gonna REALLY piss her off :D
[3:17:31] Jack_the_Dipper: This boss was the most disappointed end boss in WoW
[3:17:54] calphan84: red is the rarest
[3:18:01] nuclearphosphate: yeah apparently the red is, but she hasnt had it drop LUL
[3:18:06] nuclearphosphate: @calphan84 yeah
[3:18:20] NeeK_23: had to afk. did you get ultraxion mount?
[3:18:21] Jack_the_Dipper: Fighting his little toe

[3:18:56] CrowMomocle: Our first HC kill back in the day our hunter had run out of ammo mid-fight and had to have a Jeeves put down, we got the kill surprising. What fun.
[3:18:58] Jack_the_Dipper: Sadge
[3:19:09] Vidaloo: I just remember that back then, when we were killing spine, Madness was just the fun, chill, everyone's joking boss
[3:19:45] Jamertamer: COPIUM
[3:20:03] Jamertamer: new shop item is gunna be the thing
[3:20:15] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:20:17] Jack_the_Dipper: new HS cards/expansion Kappa
[3:20:20] Jamertamer: yep lol
[3:20:28] bwoods79: I love how powerful you feel, you can solo a boss that used to take a raid. They should make it so that a max level player can take on a bunch of "timewalking" squished players like they are a raid boss
[3:20:50] khalcrux_gaming: I was in an ad. How'd you get there so fast?
[3:21:21] NeeK_23: no Holly tweets today, so still time for a cheeky hint from her before 6pm
[3:21:51] Harper_n7: YEAH
[3:21:54] Harper_n7: caps mb
[3:22:04] thunduz: they gotta have a policy for that
[3:22:11] Thoreya: evoker dev left too
[3:22:12] khalcrux_gaming: Oh right. If you want I can demonstrate a quick spin kill. I don't want it to be horrible for you over and over.
[3:22:20] Sauc3ry: the bleeding hollow - US server crashed one time  early 2005, when my raid relogged back into Molten core, we were greeted by a horde raid inside our moltecore instance that we had to pvp while fighting off ads
[3:22:26] Sauc3ry: good times
[3:22:26] Thoreya: when RTO was announced
[3:22:27] Shocklate_: good riddance ( Kappa )
[3:22:33] NeeK_23: the "bungle" tweet was odd. If some went badly, its surprising they comment openly about it
[3:22:40] Priory: does this mean evoker gets more range finally? :P
[3:22:52] bwoods79: I'm still in shock about the survival game getting nixed
[3:22:56] Vidaloo: @Thoreya Well, guess I'm not playing evoker next expac (:
[3:22:57] dright424: Evoker dev made augment then was like well my work here is done and joined the ghostcrawler mmo
[3:23:12] NeeK_23: yeah Olando
[3:24:11] Thoreya: s4 fated?
[3:24:34] NeeK_23: delve playtest but Bran is hostile and like a raid boss LuL

[3:25:13] Thoreya: could be a game changer
[3:25:53] Thoreya: had the screenshot ready LUL
[3:26:29] NeeK_23: Im not a big classic player but is there any hype from classic players for Cata? I heard virtually nothing
[3:26:35] Thoreya: SSF and SoD same week?
[3:26:37] StreamElements: EVERYTHING Coming to the Trading Post in February 2024 | World of Warcraft - https://youtu.be/P4BTuPZUacs
[3:27:22] Harper_n7: Is anyone here excited for Cata Classic? I genuinely haven't met anyone who cares about it..
[3:27:38] UndeadKillerTBC: i hyped af for cata
[3:27:43] azzurrin: MoP
[3:27:46] Vidaloo: Mildly
[3:27:51] khalcrux_gaming: The promo reminds me of the good times in cata
[3:27:52] UndeadKillerTBC: best pvp
[3:27:53] Thoreya: im hyped for cata bc mop
[3:27:58] Harper_n7: yeah MoP classic would be lit
[3:27:59] Sauc3ry: @UndeadKillerTBC we found the guy who's hype
[3:28:00] Grissu_: I just did Firelands timewalking raid, and I forgot how I hate this raid LUL
[3:28:01] Sinrath: im hyped for MoP
[3:28:06] Grissu_: hated*
[3:28:13] dright424: SoD has new stuff thats why is exciting. A lot of WoW players played Wrath forward, so its just things they have done already.
[3:28:21] Vidaloo: Yeah MoP is hype AF
[3:28:27] NeeK_23: gotta get though MoP to get to BFA classic
[3:28:33] Grissu_: MoP pvp ,3
[3:28:34] Grissu_: <3
[3:28:40] Jack_the_Dipper: I likekd Cata morre than MoP, fight me :p
[3:28:43] RetroHACK: I am looking forward to cata.  I understand the hate but i never had a problem with it
[3:28:51] yuldovah42: yes
[3:28:53] CrowMomocle: yes, I still need rep there
[3:28:54] NeeK_23: yeah, bosses only
[3:29:11] MediumRareOG: Yes, it takes like 6 months to get exalted hydraxian warlords now. back in the day it took 5 weeks from neutral
[3:30:12] starshroudxoxo: Great. Afternoon coffee time. Glad to see your on.
[3:31:00] JaviHeals: @RetroHACK I thought it was great, but I also loved BFA...
[3:31:38] JaviHeals: I just love wow, I guess. Happy with whatever we get, seeming as we have no choice in the matter hehe
[3:32:05] JaviHeals: yeah with cata, as in back in the day we were happy with it
[3:32:28] nyrhalahotep: well, that was stressful. Bloody lava.
[3:32:40] Shocklate_: you can play through cata leveling in retail wow
[3:32:40] UndeadKillerTBC: idk why it gets so much hate
[3:32:43] Shocklate_: not classic imo
[3:32:48] JaviHeals: That is very true. It inherintly is NOT classic haha
[3:32:55] mrsrockguru: afternon @MrGM and chat
[3:33:01] JaviHeals: @Shocklate_ How can it be? (Technically)
[3:33:10] JaviHeals: we literally lose the classic zones hehe
[3:33:23] Thoreya: nope
[3:33:27] Thoreya: kinda sad about that
[3:33:35] UndeadKillerTBC: classes are way different from retail and cata thou
[3:33:37] JaviHeals: Yeah Wrath would 100000%
[3:33:59] JaviHeals: unfortunately im only getting into classic now, so kinda missed wrath this time
[3:34:08] JaviHeals: But I did it back then so don't mind
[3:34:14] Thoreya: cata
[3:34:21] MysticalOS: i thought wrath too, but truth of matter is, wrath is not very popular. i think wrath turned out to really be nostolgia and rose colored glasses. just when most started, but i think most are just not enjoying it long term. it's still much smaller in scope than 60 levels of content
[3:34:43] databob1: Looking forward to WOD classic the memes will be glorious
[3:34:44] dright424: I wonder if they will do more progression from vanilla realms in the future like Everquest does with their old content. Holly ran that EQ team.
[3:34:56] MysticalOS: i login to wrath and it's dead
[3:35:04] MysticalOS: well the private server do custom stuff
[3:35:11] MysticalOS: i think that's what we're missing
[3:35:14] JaviHeals: @dright424 I think SoD can be seen as a classic+ "beta"
[3:35:18] MysticalOS: classic is doing hardcore, SoD, etc
[3:35:22] JaviHeals: Wrath is NOT dead... im on it right now
[3:35:22] MysticalOS: wrath is doing....nothing
[3:35:25] yuldovah42: yea everyone left after ICC
[3:36:01] JaviHeals: It's busy in stormwind on pyrewood
[3:36:07] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:36:19] dright424: WoW players and calling something dead, name a more iconic duo
[3:36:19] RAF_Sean: I went to play Classic Wrath with a friend but you can't JUST play Wrath. You have to level through Vanilla and TBC and like... That defeats the whole point
[3:36:32] NeeK_23: dead realm LUL
[3:36:32] Jack_the_Dipper: yeah pretty dead :p
[3:36:34] Akela3: literally a ghost town
[3:36:35] JaviHeals: LMAO
[3:36:40] iRegretn0thing: Holy shit
[3:36:40] UndeadKillerTBC: dead game rip
[3:36:41] MysticalOS: i logged into paggle recently and there was like no body there
[3:36:42] physalis4: Do you think they stretched their selves too thin with Classic, SoD, Hardcore, and Retail? Lots of resources for 4 versions of the same game
[3:36:43] JaviHeals: god so dead
[3:36:45] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:36:47] Arlaeya: dead game dead game!
[3:36:50] iRegretn0thing: Thats so sick tho
[3:36:57] alicemch: HA busier here than the whole of lightbringer/mazrigos on retail
[3:37:04] JaviHeals: @physalis4 I'd say no, considering how much they're putting into SoD
[3:37:09] JaviHeals: Like they're doing a LOT
[3:37:15] alicemch: yeah my realm has like 4 people in valdrakken most of the time hahaha
[3:37:40] Grissu_: So many ppl in Dalaran. I miss this FeelsStrongMan
[3:38:01] JaviHeals: @alicemch thats mad, mine laggs its so busy (Tarren Mill)
[3:38:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:38:50] physalis4: You can def tell who has gold by what side of the argument ppl are on about gdkp
[3:38:52] UndeadKillerTBC: nah rmt
[3:39:03] JaviHeals: yeah that announce was ridiculous
[3:39:27] JaviHeals: I feel like twitter for wow is so negative non stop, it's difficult to even interact with the community :(
[3:39:31] X_barley: I don‚Äôt get raiders in classic in general, the cultures always felt a little off there
[3:39:47] MysticalOS: but for cata classic, i think they're gonna leavea. way to still keep old world around. The tech is there now. heck it was there in OG cata. in cata they flipped a switch to change world, but the cata client did render old world fora short time. it had a file "OldWorld.MPQ" or whatever it was named
[3:39:48] physalis4: No, you're right
[3:39:54] Akela3: not crazy
[3:39:59] MysticalOS: just add a zidormi and cata classic can have a toggle IMO
[3:40:10] JaviHeals: @X_barley I think they want to act like it's really complex, when it's not...
[3:40:18] RAF_Sean: Almost like them calling it a bad decision isn't them being genuine
[3:40:33] nuclearphosphate: what are the scarab loot that you get from the coffers in ahn qiraj? ive got a LOT of each type
[3:40:38] MysticalOS: i think they've learned over years preservation is important
[3:40:45] MysticalOS: it's why they're bringing old stuff back on retail.
[3:42:03] MysticalOS: we already have two undercities
[3:42:22] MysticalOS: right, but pointis tehy can phase cities
[3:42:39] calphan84: the plague has been cleansed from undercity
[3:42:41] Crumsa: Did you know about the skip so you don't have to go through the traps?
[3:43:15] MysticalOS: dungeons, they proved they can bring old scarlet monstary back, near effortlessly
[3:43:21] MysticalOS: and that dungeonw as massively revamped
[3:44:29] alextheblight: hope they do
[3:44:37] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[3:44:44] MysticalOS: i think ZA and ZG is something I see them bringin back, both of those they didn't change the maps
[3:44:50] UndeadKillerTBC: maybe they do something like they did for ony in wotlk
[3:44:59] Priory: i really hope they are working on new content and not reworking old content for retail
[3:45:02] Priory: keep that in classic
[3:45:22] UndeadKillerTBC: i mean u can switch from wotlk and classic ony
[3:45:29] MysticalOS: well in wrath classic you can do level 60 ony still, they added tech for that.
[3:45:50] UndeadKillerTBC: yup
[3:46:19] BBMezzy: Guarantee it?
[3:46:19] UndeadKillerTBC: i hope they do it with zg and za also in cata
[3:46:29] Wextak: pirates ?
[3:46:34] RAF_Sean: Gotta go shower before raid. Gonna lurk for a bit Darth Dan
[3:46:43] Iwony: oh?

[3:47:15] MysticalOS: Orlando has been tweeting a lot last couple days, and patch 10.2.6 is his baby.
[3:47:18] MysticalOS: it's any day
[3:47:25] luckynightwow: We're getting an AWC post at least!
[3:48:06] nuclearphosphate: got the X53 touring rocket from trading post, couldnt be arsed with the hideous furry
[3:50:28] Sauc3ry: I doubt we'd ever see a preserved world for classic in cata though, They had to rework all of the classic zones for cata to allow flying. I cant see them spending the resources to get flying working in the old world, so it dosnt feel archaic compared to the zones with flight
[3:50:34] nuclearphosphate: the fox mount
[3:50:56] MysticalOS: oh they'd just disable flying in old phase
[3:51:28] nuclearphosphate: Du it
[3:51:29] Sharktribe: I'd like to see a model swap for 1. Trees and 2. Buildings. With that and procedural ground clutter/grass the world could look revamped in a significant way
[3:52:03] Jack_the_Dipper: So far, the only big news I have seen today is Lewis Hamiton may be driving for Ferrari in 2025. Let's see if Blizzard can top it :p
[3:52:26] Dunkurk: some of the absolue wiazrd shit that pserver people can do is impressive
[3:52:26] nuclearphosphate: cant stand hamilton, he's a w@nker
[3:52:41] MysticalOS: dragonriding is fickle in old world. it doesn't work super well with sharding. it's why they slowed it down in fact. it takes a couple seconds to hop to a new shard. and some zones are small.
[3:52:50] Jack_the_Dipper: He is a bit of asskisser yes
[3:53:01] luckynightwow: Yup, pretty impressive. Hooking so many animations for dragonriding is insane
[3:53:03] nuclearphosphate: @MysticalOS i find it works brilliantly
[3:53:11] MysticalOS: in fact if i'm at full speed i still get massive lag, cause I flew over a small zone so fast i was still shifting sshards, when i hit 2nd boarder, it confused client and DCed me
[3:53:15] khalcrux_gaming: I haven't used wands in retail in a while. Are they worth anything or do they work with off hands? I wanna use transmog
[3:53:19] Jack_the_Dipper: But a great driver in a great team
[3:53:19] MysticalOS: oh I can tell they slowed it down, massively
[3:53:26] MysticalOS: the speed falloff is worse too
[3:53:42] D4v1d7w17ch: nah, very little to no difference.
[3:53:43] khalcrux_gaming: I did. I'm not mad but it's not worth slowing. It's so fun
[3:53:44] MysticalOS: it peaks at around 1200 in weak aura instead of 1400
[3:53:54] MysticalOS: but wht i notice is speed starts to falloff faster
[3:53:59] luckynightwow: aren't people using ellies dragonriding addon? it shows speed & thrill of the kies
[3:54:04] MysticalOS: i have to use the skyward flick more often

[3:55:18] Jack_the_Dipper: but what did you do at McLaren? @MrGM
[3:55:27] MysticalOS: i def notice it, but i'm a far better dragonn rider than most. I know how to maximize my speed more consistently. most people don't actually keep their dragon anywhere near full speed
[3:55:31] Jack_the_Dipper: really?/
[3:55:34] MysticalOS: cause that requires skyward ascend flying
[3:55:51] Jack_the_Dipper: aaah
[3:56:00] Jack_the_Dipper: Verry cool
[3:56:14] Jack_the_Dipper: And now your sreaming..... wait wut?

[3:57:28] Jack_the_Dipper: yeah
[3:57:37] Jack_the_Dipper: Im Dutch so yeah I watch it now even morre :D\
[3:57:57] Jack_the_Dipper: cool
[3:58:29] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL maybe
[3:58:54] Jack_the_Dipper: Well... go buy one Kappa
[3:59:34] Jack_the_Dipper: :D
[3:59:39] Jack_the_Dipper: for the food hahaha
[3:59:58] MysticalOS: hardcore self found season of masterful discovery when?
[4:00:16] MysticalOS: I'm just meming, when they gonna combine it all
[4:00:31] MysticalOS: hardcore was driven almost entirely by content creators
[4:00:37] Dunkurk: SoD kinda muted Hardcore, but self found will get the youtube videos poping again for a while
[4:00:42] MysticalOS: well for streamers, no pixel 4.0 came out
[4:00:42] ShineyFighter: Evening yall, evening dan. sporkySalute
[4:00:44] MysticalOS: and wow meta died
[4:01:01] MysticalOS: GTA rp
[4:01:05] qbert292: I use to watch a lot Valorant streamers and they played it for a while but gave up pn it
[4:01:07] ShineyFighter: mrgmL um's good.
[4:01:26] qbert292: Yeah
[4:01:30] qbert292: I love riot games
[4:01:43] qbert292: when I get my degree I would work there
[4:02:10] qbert292: They are making an office in seattle
[4:02:44] qbert292: Oh god I wouldn't know
[4:03:02] qbert292: They are making a fighting game rn
[4:03:34] qbert292: I know only some things because my friend is a game dev
[4:04:13] Wextak: PogU
[4:04:18] ShineyFighter: that was fast.
[4:04:18] Sharktribe: Are you Irish? Because you got some luck
[4:04:27] ShineyFighter: sporkyBongo GG
[4:04:31] dwolf010: it feels like a long time ago we had retail news. even tho it has just been a week or 3 sinse last patch.

[4:05:22] Xesol: i hope so because this last patch was kind of underwhelming
[4:05:32] Priory: Plunder Isle and 10 men raid
[4:05:35] Priory: :P
[4:05:35] Lakatarmen: Does it have to be pirates doe?
[4:05:35] MysticalOS: i just know if 10.2.6 isn't super impressive, it's gonna backfire
[4:05:40] Priory: non-competitive
[4:05:48] khalcrux_gaming: "How do we not have a pink dress?!?....I'm glad nobody was around to hear me say that."
[4:06:05] death_cam_: was there any update from that datamined "vampire survivor" mode with the dreadlord cosmetic mogs? (wowhead post from a while ago)
[4:06:07] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:06:12] khalcrux_gaming: yeah they're purple
[4:06:13] MysticalOS: i don't think pirates are the important part of patch. the important part is that it's made by the experimental features team. same team that made follower dungeons
[4:06:23] MysticalOS: whatever patch is, it's something new
[4:06:32] Ghostopheles: what's going on in here
[4:06:42] Lausten: What comes up if you do a google image search for the pirate logo?
[4:07:02] dwolf010: acording to Orlando Salvatore 10.2.6 gametest was " bungle"
[4:07:48] khalcrux_gaming: Thought it was bungled
[4:07:57] CrowMomocle: Bungle ~ Zippy and George come to mind.
[4:08:58] MysticalOS: I immediately think of jethro tull, bungle in the jungle
[4:09:09] MysticalOS: jungle fits pirate theme
[4:09:20] MysticalOS: and lethro fits orandlo, so
[4:09:22] Ghostopheles: HSAnn hearthstone anniversary
[4:09:24] MysticalOS: jethro*
[4:09:25] Ghostopheles: secret hearthstone tavern
[4:10:13] Lausten: Theres the Hearthstone easter egg quest in Azure Span, and I even think the NPC says they will see us in the future
[4:10:23] Lakatarmen: Did they ever conclude the ending of brackenhide hollow ? doesnt that boss just dissapear?
[4:10:31] CrowMomocle: @MysticalOS Oh yes, definitely that too! <23
[4:10:44] CrowMomocle: <3
[4:11:09] iRegretn0thing: Could be brawler's guild too?

[4:14:25] UlthraneDK: monkaHmm
[4:14:27] Iwony: the was back wards engineered....
[4:14:30] MysticalOS: how are you still using wow tools anyways? wasn't that discontinued ages ago?
[4:14:51] khalcrux_gaming: How's Blizzard gonna know?
[4:14:57] Ghostopheles: I'm being censored
[4:14:59] TwistedHBG: inb4 blizzard cops show up
[4:15:05] ShineyFighter: mrgmAlright sus
[4:15:18] Neostigma: Btw... be carefull as her email is there ..
[4:15:20] nokster: ah so its cod zombie mode
[4:15:26] Xesol: seeing this code makes me think i could definitely switch to game dev
[4:15:37] vuhdubones: heritage armor added?
[4:15:41] Neostigma: fair enough
[4:15:48] Xesol: i code for healthcare right now its a lot more complex from the looks of things
[4:15:51] Ghostopheles: client scenes are an entire thing that are not super easy to understand - me and marl (and others) have been trying to understand it for a while
[4:15:59] MysticalOS: vampire survivor mode?
[4:16:28] Lestatis: i'd be so down. Vampire Survivors is a bangin game
[4:16:56] MysticalOS: vampire survivor is a trademark
[4:17:07] MysticalOS: same reason they renamed sharknado to shard tornado
[4:17:09] luckynightwow: Wasn't something similar used in the Uuna scenario?
[4:17:11] JakeSezz: Aight I‚Äôm back from a dr‚Äôs appointment. Miss anything? mrgmJAM
[4:17:41] nuclearphosphate: i seem to have encountered a bug.... was collecting monies from auctions (talking around 400k gold) and was met with "internal mail error" and it gave me 0 gold O.o
[4:17:42] RAF_Sean: How long until Blizz takes down the stream?
[4:18:02] nuclearphosphate: to say im pissed off missing out on that amount due to a bug is.....
[4:18:19] Ghostopheles: it's not hidden and you can't do anything with it anyways - this code is completely inaccessible in the game
[4:19:11] Ghostopheles: 90% of the code in these scripts is reused since they're just a collection of shared packages - the stuff unique that specific script is usually all the way at the bottom
[4:19:25] Neostigma: probably going to be like pet battles or plant vs zombies style
[4:19:52] ShineyFighter: aw sporkyHeart
[4:19:57] Elrathir: what if me am that kind of orc? :)
[4:20:02] bashingsticks: bashingsticks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[4:20:42] Xesol: this is kind of awesome lol
[4:21:04] Ghostopheles: surely not
[4:21:07] TwistedHBG: why would the icon be a pirate flag tho
[4:21:27] Neostigma: battleship game
[4:21:28] Ghostopheles: I should edit wiki with a bunch of this scenescript info if marl hasn't already
[4:21:44] MysticalOS: i still think it could endup having nothing to do with pirates. a red herring playing off the twitter meme
[4:21:46] chelfx: 6 minutes
[4:21:49] Priory: would be disappointing, i expect some more wow-like content
[4:21:55] Neostigma: Once you have worked in it so long, its just all memory;
[4:22:10] Elrathir: vampire survivors is a game that features no vampires, so maybe a pirate survivors is a mode that features no pirates
[4:22:15] Neostigma: It looks well organised.
[4:22:24] Priory: and i say that a someone who binge played VS
[4:22:28] Priory: as*
[4:22:49] Ghostopheles: start from the bottom and go up
[4:23:19] Ghostopheles: I'm 90% sure the only creatures refrenced in these are zombies
[4:23:39] MysticalOS: DNT is used a lot, do not touch tag
[4:23:55] nuclearphosphate: AWC?
[4:24:07] Ghostopheles: Pog
[4:24:10] MysticalOS: AWC, yawn
[4:24:13] thunduz: what is this?!
[4:24:26] Ghostopheles: AWC? I'm just hanging on the MDI realms, MDI better

[4:24:55] adampanerabread: they also just made a bluepost about it 2min ago
[4:25:04] RAF_Sean: Do they give these guys access to in game assets and tools?
[4:25:07] adampanerabread: yea
[4:25:16] Ghostopheles: @RAF_Sean ye
[4:25:28] Ghostopheles: Sadge
[4:25:30] Elrathir: feels bad for vulpera fans
[4:25:36] amricatt: I don't pvp but this is amazing.
[4:25:59] Dunkurk: see if the AWC was broadcast like this instead of the cluster of UI elements that actual gameplay is it would be a lot more watchable
[4:26:04] Elrathir: yoink
[4:26:12] ShineyFighter: heh the mid air yoink.
[4:26:22] RAF_Sean: Makes me wanna pvp
[4:26:23] ShineyFighter: sporkyLOL

[4:27:34] MysticalOS: cause rest would just be accessing varaible, you just want to see where they set it
[4:28:02] TwistedHBG: they never publish stuff early right?
[4:28:05] luckynightwow: sometimes news go at 11am 12am...
[4:28:07] dwolf010: well if there is no further news. why release this 5min earlier
[4:28:11] Layliah79: maybe the new guy/gal is on vacation this week
