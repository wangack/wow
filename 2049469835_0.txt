[2:58:52] BeefnBeanzTV: kermit: Hypothetical question. How would you get a small cylinder. About 5 inches in length and 4 inches in girth. Unstuck from a mini M and M tube filled with butter and microwaved mashed banana? Without injuring it? Asking for a friend.
[2:59:29] wrogDG: !ask How would you get a small cylinder. About 5 inches in length and 4 inches in girth. Unstuck from a mini M and M tube filled with butter and microwaved mashed banana? Without injuring it?
[2:59:30] StreamElements: @wrogDG I would recommend chilling the tube in the refrigerator to solidify the butter and mashed banana then carefully use a narrow object like a chopstick to gently push the cylinder out Be cautious and avoid applying too much force to prevent injury

[5:01:39] ripinpeace10: he doesnt even play wow lol
[5:01:40] xosarr: spoken like like 1%
[5:01:42] bignickyg123: so shut the fuck up then lmao
[5:01:43] mediumbenis: I dont have to buy gold Madge my stream viewers will buy my gold and give it to me for free Madge and I dont care if they get banned Madge Ban them Madge Don't inconvenience me Madge
[5:01:44] NotASkiller: @smellygoatz you think Asmon needs to do gdkp? his viewers would give him his bis while sucking his dicj
[5:01:48] Rufous420: i think blizzard sucks but the people at blizzard who are in charge of hiring gms arent necessarily the same people who decided to ban gdkps
[5:01:52] not_grieves: If they banned all gold buyers then gdkp wouldn't matter right
[5:01:57] kenxxys: botting and gdkps are the same  thing
[5:01:59] Sneakychris7: lil bro is just yappin
[5:02:01] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: can we get your take on his take
[5:02:01] pogginpetealt: adam: he talks about it like he doesnt benefit from gold buying. people only give him gold they earn from playing.
[5:02:02] zdh7: there's like an unwritten rule that the 'legitimate' GDKPers need to play dumb when asked where their cut comes from
[5:02:02] retau_: does he think the game will collapse without it?
[5:02:02] ripinpeace10: asmon barely even touches wow
[5:02:05] kenxxys: thats like .000001%
[5:02:05] xosarr: thats such cap
[5:02:08] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: bean can we get your take on his take
[5:02:13] scarlboro: i think i'm the only person
[5:02:14] SmellyGoatZ: yea u know its low as fuck
[5:02:16] ripinpeace10: @Bean look at xaryus video on it its really good
[5:02:25] kidb_yo: blizz had to ban them now before the economy got totally out of hand
[5:02:27] 3shotBR: one thing he never mentions is how blizzard should ban the actually gold buyers not just the botters
[5:02:31] mediumbenis: @乔什 he spends like a third of the clip talking about how its emergent gameplay lol
[5:02:34] Tabrill: no one farms
[5:02:38] Rufous420: yeah and if you want to make gold from gdkps you get it from gold buyers
[5:02:40] bignickyg123: who the fuck farms LOL
[5:02:45] maximumdrip: i agree with him, idk why you all are so mad about his take
[5:02:46] vaeleas: honestly i was so late into sod i considered buying gold for gdpks
[5:02:58] ripinpeace10: @Bean https://x.com/Xaryu/status/1752422703800213662?s=20 this is a better take
[5:02:59] StreamElements: Thanks for sharing the link I'll check it out and let you know what I think
[5:03:01] zdh7: OTK is a gold buying org of course he's going to stan GDKP
[5:03:18] kenxxys: there would be like 75% less bots if GDKP werent a thing
[5:03:19] Rufous420: thats why you have to give out harsher punishments for gold buyers
[5:03:25] rottencore1: gold would just be more expensive
[5:03:25] BingoTingler: they need to ban gold buyers and take the possibly temporary financial hit to better their own game
[5:03:31] 3shotBR: a bot is profitable after 30days....they can sell enought gold to pay for that account and alil more
[5:03:37] Relax94: @zdh7 he doesn’t even play wow anymore lol
[5:03:45] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: if u aint buying gold u aint trying
[5:03:59] NotASkiller: Adam: Bean, with tank bozz coming back for phase 2, don't you think you should look out for your boy and show some concern over the ban on g d k p? Take this shit to Twitter. As far as tank boss is concerned, Asmon gold is right on this
[5:04:03] zdh7: @Relax94 im talking about soda
[5:04:05] ripinpeace10: @Bean https://x.com/Xaryu/status/1752422703800213662?s=20 this is a better take  󠀀
[5:04:07] s4mmie: Incorrect Take.
[5:04:08] murxll99: they ban spitting but not the bots. thats all you need to know about this company
[5:04:10] s4mmie: You Are Wrong.
[5:04:14] SmellyGoatZ: !drama
[5:04:15] StreamElements: BIG DRAMA
[5:04:16] mcboonee: its not a black and white problem. their move of TRYING to prevent gdkp is the best they can do
[5:04:17] SmellyGoatZ: Alarm
[5:04:30] mcboonee: as a company etc
[5:04:38] kenxxys: healthy brain take
[5:04:44] zdh7: I think the vast majority would agree with the statement that 'in a perfect world where no one bought gold, GDKPs would be ok'. but thats not reality
[5:04:45] s4mmie: wrong take
[5:04:46] SmellyGoatZ: xdd xaryu
[5:04:49] Hoodstrong: stfu bean @Bean
[5:04:53] crockz95: First globe Pog
[5:04:54] BingoTingler: GDKP would be a very fun way to play the game if they removed the way to sell gold.
[5:04:56] 3shotBR: rememeber when soda bought $5000 worth of gold for his furrty shit?
[5:04:58] mcboonee: yea its so BS. like i played until WoD and i didnt have that much gold

[5:05:12] Tabrill: its the main reason
[5:05:16] DylskiTV: Also people bidding up the pot also sucks
[5:05:17] Tabrill: kinda the only reason
[5:05:18] vaeleas: woke af
[5:05:18] s4mmie: wrong take streamer
[5:05:25] NotASkiller: FirstTimeChadder
[5:05:28] s4mmie: we should just allow you to purchase BIS
[5:05:33] s4mmie: $50 for bis
[5:05:37] kenxxys: GDKP is for angry manchildren that cant handle the idea of playing the game without winning the shiny item
[5:05:38] bakedbeansandbread: true
[5:05:40] zdh7: this is blizzard tackling the demand side of GDKP, and not just the supply side like bot ban waves
[5:05:41] subsonic_eye: ive only done one in my life and it was ion SoD, didnt want to gdkp but my friend ran it so it was cool, made 30g
[5:05:44] welshywelshh: just adopt the warmane treatment and charge $250 for a legendary and $30 per epic
[5:05:44] bakedbeansandbread: s4mmie u should work at blizzard
[5:05:45] theonlypadrejoe: GDKP is poggers…you can get a shit ton of gold from the people that buy gold
[5:05:45] welshywelshh: np
[5:05:45] zdh7: of RMT*
[5:05:46] Graycen: going to a gdkp is just buying gold with ur time
[5:05:54] Parametik: all in all the pros outweigh the cons
[5:05:57] kenxxys: true
[5:06:09] Parametik: idk why people are all of a sudden swapping to the latter argument
[5:06:17] boof_surprise: when you are smarter than everyone else in he room very few can understand you
[5:06:17] mcboonee: you will be able to launder it through AH and alts
[5:06:19] mcboonee: so easy
[5:06:21] wrogDG: adam: in my opinion asmon is not realizing that GDKP has disincentivized the whole normal guild culture, and thats  prolly what blizzard wants to experiment with, to see if its even still possible?
[5:06:21] crockz95: discords
[5:06:24] Decoyduck: what about the GDKP discords?
[5:06:24] ripinpeace10: @Bean are they just gonna not let ppl trade gold while in raid?
[5:06:26] Parametik: Lotus runs
[5:06:27] scarlboro: straight RMT
[5:06:29] voraxsgaming: Ticket runs were so lit Lmao
[5:06:30] xosarr: popcorn is rdy fr first ban wave

[5:08:39] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: dirty gold buying bastards
[5:08:40] Graycen: went for 700k LUL
[5:08:40] theonlypadrejoe: The GDKP andies are just lazy fucks

[5:09:11] Parametik: dude you remember bean like 1-2 weeks into SWP there was a 1 mill pot?
[5:09:15] kenxxys: it does ruin the game
[5:09:18] kenxxys: it absolutely does
[5:09:18] s4mmie: just allow gold buying and selling
[5:09:19] ripinpeace10: @Bean gdkps are the main incentive to buy gold aint no one buying thousands of gold to buy consums on the ah
[5:09:20] Graycen: just ruins pugs too
[5:09:20] mcboonee: it does
[5:09:21] s4mmie: open the gates
[5:09:22] BingoTingler: I did GDKP's back in the day of current ICC content on alts. I farmed all my own gold though. It was fun back then.
[5:09:22] Graycen: theres no like pug raids
[5:09:25] maximumdrip: @乔什 i use 2. what do you use that completely stops twitch ads
[5:09:29] Graycen: IM DOING A PUG RAID TONIGHT THO GUYS ICC IF U HAVE A CHARACTER
[5:09:30] kenxxys: makes farming feel meaningless if others just buy gold
[5:09:32] zdh7: a legitimate GDKP would mean they screen how people acquire their gold, which just isnt possible
[5:09:33] Tabrill: adam: now g bids on the other hand..
[5:09:35] theonlypadrejoe: you need 100k to raid on alts in wotlk
[5:09:43] NotASkiller: Adam: this is your weekly reminder that Bean bought a bis piece of gear for around 94k which he magically pulled out of his asshole. One. Piece. Of gear
[5:09:44] scarlboro: the thing that ruins classic first and foremost is blizzard not banning egregious and obvious bot trains that pour into a tree and fly hack by the hundreds

[5:12:40] StreamElements: @boof_surprise The GDKP (Gold-DKP) system in gaming can affect character immersion by introducing a transactional element to the gameplay It shifts the focus from immersion in the game world to acquiring in-game wealth which may detract from the immersive experience for some players
