[2:31:11] Ariye23: league is more micro intensive when it comes to the actual movement and abilities
[2:31:14] 18jsilvanuskill: just push an win
[2:31:17] TheSirSack: If you want micro you should play jungle tbh
[2:31:22] cieloboi: I dont know what happened I just got here but I just want to say that LoL is for noobs
[2:31:25] StraightTuna: thank god you are banned
[2:31:27] marsomoto: but isnt dota slower from the pace? not playing it for a long period
[2:31:28] FeldyTV: these complaints..
[2:31:30] kuiper2222: no arguments dota is harder and superior in every way
[2:31:30] 18jsilvanuskill: ez is carrying rn

[2:33:22] Ariye23: as a support, when your item is progressed the item becomes a warding item
[2:33:57] obi_lipnik: you can pop that E if you press again @TommyKayLIVE

[2:37:18] Ariye23: your champion yes
[2:37:21] boarkins: lux has one of the lowest cooldowns
[2:37:24] TheSirSack: For the early levels
[2:37:25] cannednudle: you can build Lux to get her ult to like 12 seconds
[2:37:27] Milann104: Lux is known for having a really low cooldown
[2:37:27] esbernaz: late game luxx ult cd can be 12 sec

[2:38:03] fqxz123: nowadays every league champ has low cd on ult. It's night and day compared to old League.
[2:38:04] cannednudle: dont let go of it
[2:38:04] ukrainebeatsrussia: there  is a  option
[2:38:06] 18jsilvanuskill: heal is actually good for supps in bot lane since it heals u and ur adc and it also speeds u both up

[2:44:28] cannednudle: @imSubt1e wrong
[2:44:28] listrong7: @imSubt1e Sorry but its not
[2:44:33] 18jsilvanuskill: @listrong7 fax

[2:44:54] wastingmylife7: zoraKa
[2:45:01] bruxseles: Sera might be to complicated
[2:45:01] Greedyboyi: Wtf, Tommy playing lol?
[2:45:04] taavitiivi: @bruxseles Nah, he is going to be mad that he uses his own hp to heal others KEKW
[2:45:04] endrujuj: best healer = alistar
[2:45:05] TheSirSack: @ChibiYordle Nah its a competition

[2:45:22] GoodBoiiRey: @imSubt1e i think dota is easier but okay sure KEKW
[2:45:24] Greedyboyi: Who let Tommy play lol? It's a life long problem
[2:45:31] TheSirSack: @tempestad17 Its 13:22 here in Europe, why would we eat now haha
[2:45:36] LarsAgnar: click on it
[2:45:36] listrong7: because game treats you as a newb atm
[2:45:36] Greedyboyi: Don't play quickplay @TommyKayLIVE
[2:45:49] tempestad17: @TheSirSack clearly you don't live in spain KEKL
[2:45:51] Ariye23: its only quickboy available until level 30
[2:45:54] Greedyboyi: Bots... @TommyKayLIVE
[2:45:55] Marcickany: pvp is too early
[2:45:55] bruxseles: @TommyKayLIVE You are not gona heal with lux, buy soraka for 450 she mainly heals like a wow character
[2:45:57] endrujuj: @TommyKayLIVE you cant make your own runes yet because of low level
[2:46:05] Ariye23: lux is a damage carry in support
[2:46:05] TheSirSack: @tempestad17 Yeah ok 12:22 for you but still
[2:46:07] Ariye23: you wont heal
[2:46:08] 18jsilvanuskill: when u get in lobby u have to call sup role
[2:46:10] therealManturio: Players in levels 1 to 9 cannot create nor edit rune pages.
[2:46:13] 18jsilvanuskill: say supp in chat
[2:46:15] iteryn: Tommy about to get flamed to shit by some randoms
[2:46:16] Raigeku: true
[2:46:18] L0sL0b0s: tommy this is the most toxic game possible it literally will ruin your life
[2:46:20] cannednudle: league vs dota poll up
[2:46:22] therealManturio: New accounts have three empty rune pages available
[2:46:23] Chocoboyzs: When I saw the game category I couldnt believe my eyes but it is real
[2:46:27] Ariye23: I'd recommend watching Arcane if you haven't @TommyKayLIVE
[2:46:31] zCasi98: usually girls play that cat cuz it's retarted
[2:46:35] GoodBoiiRey: @TommyKayLIVE the cat is a meme champion for support players that dont want to play the game
[2:46:36] endrujuj: @therealManturio yeah but you get presets only
[2:46:37] Chocoboyzs: Click on Pantheon
[2:46:39] listrong7: those are new champions it used to be more masculine
[2:46:39] Greedyboyi: You need to play against bots first to get to lvl10 atleast and get more champions with BE @TommyKayLIVE
[2:46:40] vorjaard: click on the emo boy
[2:46:40] dresy: dota is way better
[2:46:42] Ariye23: Its genuinely good trust
[2:46:43] esbernaz: its a game for hoi4 players like us
[2:46:43] therealManturio: It is not possible to enter a match without an active, valid rune page. In such case, the game will automatically assign the player with the recommended rune page for their champion and role, upon game start.
[2:46:44] Marcickany: arcane is 10/10 story
[2:46:47] 18jsilvanuskill: lol is winning the poll
[2:46:51] nandolambada: ni hao @TommyKayLIVE
[2:46:54] Akinatur: Tommy playing LOL 2024 already delivering
[2:46:56] cannednudle: damn dota getting obliterated
[2:46:56] bruxseles: @TommyKayLIVE Get soraka for 450 she basicly only heals, you are not gona heal with lux
[2:46:56] Chocoboyzs: wait nvm lmao
[2:47:04] therealManturio: @endrujuj yeah im just copying the lol page
[2:47:06] Ariye23: you have rune presets because youre low level
[2:47:12] Ariye23: so cant change
[2:47:12] therealManturio: for runes
