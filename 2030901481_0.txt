[2:52:29] Gushingcoom: jesus take the wheel
[2:52:31] FoxiekittenWoW: looking at the stuff they will release in phase two it looks like it gonna be pretty similar to phase one. Do the raid twice a week, do the new pvp event else you just run around and farm stuff or do whatever. @Killaroy123
[2:52:33] charmsrules: that just seems like such trash design. getting dueled at 50% and dying in it
[2:52:33] Cybernytez: KEKW
[2:52:58] Zerolol123: wait phase 2 SoD is coming out during AWC season right? hopefully it's not like previously where most people were playing wrath and not practicing for tourney season LUL

[2:53:17] sirali78: Yo wusup
[2:53:21] NPBeharry: Chuck do demo burst in Palumors video
[2:53:22] buffevoker: If u look at details sub damage kinda low i expect 10% all ability buff
[2:53:23] deadlycalm: 🤣🤣
[2:53:24] ChumpSeason: bruh that's a whole kidney lol
[2:53:24] NPBeharry: :)
[2:53:28] Itankarenas: wow, completely gutted
[2:53:35] Cybernytez: "no" dmg
[2:53:38] Cybernytez: 10 %
[2:53:58] Runescale: yea
[2:54:00] lilskeets: outlaw is #2 in pve
[2:54:00] Runescale: by about 10%
[2:54:01] NPBeharry: ya
[2:54:02] Zerolol123: sub pve is really fun
[2:54:04] Killaroy123: yea that’s how I felt with phase 1 just run BFD and farm shit sucked
[2:54:05] twin1123: i think its outlaw
[2:54:05] gregl__: wanna see our volcoross log from this week dew
[2:54:06] gregl__: hold on
[2:54:07] diuoe: i think that's because of windfury totem
[2:54:09] Cdenzy: so weird cause sub is always the pvp spec
[2:54:09] kakichoco: rogue has been good for decades..
[2:54:13] nehpets808: Assa will be buffed beyond sub ... Blizzard can't have sub #1
[2:54:13] arancs: look smolderon warcraftlogs for a sec
[2:54:14] Killaroy123: hoping for a better phase 2
[2:54:14] snorkeltime: retail lol
[2:54:15] sirali78: rogue op in pve for 5years
[2:54:15] EFFSIN: guess what
[2:54:19] kiethuynh5195: !macro
[2:54:19] Killaroy123: will see tho
[2:54:21] gregl__: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/3bRH2nyZwXJMAGQf#fight=18&type=damage-done @cdewx
[2:54:26] gregl__: real normal spec
[2:54:26] EFFSIN: assa is #3
[2:54:32] EFFSIN: j[

[2:54:37] EFFSIN: jp
[2:54:39] Rafikki: Stv is going to be sick
[2:54:42] lilskeets: classic wow= raid logging, just is what it is which is fine imo
[2:54:44] chefdejour82: im just going to wait till lvl 60 phase release
[2:55:12] lilskeets: people spending irl money for gold to get bis lvl 25 gear is wild
[2:55:13] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[2:55:20] ChumpSeason: SoD made classic too "wacky" for my tastes personally
[2:55:21] Killaroy123: it’s kinda just like wait for the last season and then go
[2:55:23] Itankarenas: The only fun part is the Ashenvale event when you get a 60v60 clash
[2:55:39] Cybernytez: SOD lvling = walking 5 secs -> getting ganked by a rogue, rezz, walk 5 sec, get ganked by rogue / repeat infinetly
[2:55:43] Itankarenas: i dont
[2:55:44] ratherbee: tons of lag
[2:55:44] EFFSIN: ye
[2:55:46] Noosekingx: world pvp is way more fun that retail arena lmfao
[2:55:47] Mattyklol: yeah its shitty
[2:55:50] lilskeets: theres not much lag, but theres also no pvp

[2:56:20] Exxtinctiion: better than what I remember but still some lag
[2:56:21] Bingelderry: kEkW
[2:56:34] Itankarenas: @Cavice disc is probably the most beginner friendly
[2:56:34] Noosekingx: @taran127 nah i still get gladiator every season on retail casually, but world pvp with the boys is way more fun
[2:56:38] Noosekingx: retail is too dead now

[3:16:05] sh3ikmustafa: arena has such a barrier to entry
[3:16:20] Magottx: lot of no bueno players too and clasic is easy

[3:17:51] Blackington27: I'm a hate-watcher, personally Kappa
[3:18:17] Leggobro: i think also theres way more possibility for funny/awesome content in classic than 3s in WoW these days

[3:40:28] Cybernytez: oh yeah the reason why theres so much piss cc is probably because of pve

[3:45:06] Leggobro: yeah thats insane
[3:45:11] truthordair: or 1.2 * 1.2 after the buff

[3:49:50] lykaionxd17: is there like a certain button type it feels like it’s just missing compared to other healers?
[3:49:56] truthordair: larger range destroys the identity, though

[3:53:21] waffleberryx: @KurosQt play wrath, bubbles are immortal there
[3:53:35] VitoBambino: 3 charge unpurgeable 30 second cc would be broken for every class except.... you know who LOL
[3:53:54] MaybeRespect: Yeah idk about that 1`

[3:54:03] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:56:02] truthordair: making shroud unpurgeable seems like too much, but what if you still took the dr's so rogues couldn't sap x3 into a full sap?
[3:57:10] TizTich: thatd be a weird interaction but i kinda lilke it
[3:57:15] simszszy: PogChamp

[3:59:31] magicmanxo: @cdewx Do you think it shroud having an internal CD for things like sap/sheep so it cant just be spam sapped and sheeped off would be a good idea?
[3:59:36] lykaionxd17: what a match
[3:59:42] waffleberryx: that start was insane you sat thru stun fear rep silence and mes didnt trade ibf
[3:59:46] charmsrules: short cd on shell into double caster is crazy

[4:00:26] TizTich: sub has seen enough nerfs
[4:00:28] TizTich: plz not again
[4:00:29] MaybeRespect: Shroud is kinda crazy. Considering you can rescue/verdant while silenced and commune while ccd
[4:00:31] gossamur: I feel like they will never change verdant leap because of pve
[4:00:33] Aroty: and echo'ing target and verdant yourself isn't an extra global and less heal right
[4:00:57] MaybeRespect: Yeah like Rogues...druids maybe. But must classes w.o spammable CC
[4:02:36] TizTich: feel like they just need to give sub decent dam outside of dance, make dance 1 charge and buff dance dam for it to be balanced
[4:03:00] MaybeRespect: @TizTich Bro rogues be 1 tapping already lol
[4:03:22] Zerolol123: sub has never been about consistent damage and it shouldn't ever be
[4:03:45] TizTich: yea but double dance charge and 2 vanishes give them access to so much cc after dr's drop
[4:03:55] TizTich: people are complaining about consistent cc not teh dam
[4:04:02] TizTich: they have short cds shit ton of cc that needs to be nerfed
[4:04:09] addyz0r: does mag have a team for awc? would be cool
[4:04:09] Zerolol123: i'm saying you said to give sub consistent damage
[4:04:16] ncro1337: do u play precog

[4:06:35] IamWalnuts: jesus
[4:06:39] Zartirian: hmm
[4:06:42] chefdejour82: lol
[4:06:45] waffleberryx: changing spammable cc to having charges with short cds would be interesting
[4:07:06] TheEyeVII: rogue is not about having dmg or not, the kit is just broken, change defensives & cd on stuns/-1 vanish etc, otherwise it'll literally always be op when it has dmg or only good in setup comps
[4:07:08] Itankarenas: @waffleberryx that sounds like an interesting change tbh
[4:07:15] freelofear: remove duel 1 time
[4:07:33] TizTich: I want sub to be like mop/wod
[4:07:34] MaybeRespect: What's your thoughts on double caster making your class unplayable with piss cc ?
[4:07:45] IamWalnuts: making all rogues having dance is stupid
[4:07:49] TizTich: mop/wod it was dance 1 min
[4:07:53] TizTich: big dam in the 1 min
[4:07:54] qkmood: cheapshot had a fat energy cost

[4:10:38] armoryme: cheap should cost more energy. being able to cheap both off targets and 3x the kill target within 1 dance is dumb
[4:10:48] magnesiium1: double step and teleport wiht shadow strike
[4:10:49] Itankarenas: cata was the best version of rogue
[4:10:50] TheEyeVII: what's hilarious is ya'll beat gg with a rogue on your team, which just shows if you fotm it's just about the team

[4:30:54] Laythos: Darkness now has a 15% chance to avoid all damage from an attack. Chance to avoid damage increased by 100% when not in a raid.
[4:30:57] LuxtheGod: are pvp tier sets a thing again or is it shared with pve
[4:30:58] Laythos: is what the patch notes said
[4:31:08] Pontacos: Rsham seems so fun
[4:31:16] Laythos: still 15% is fucking dog
[4:31:17] Laythos: what?
[4:31:27] LuxtheGod: increased by 100% is not the same as increased to 100% lol
[4:31:27] Irony3: its 50% fixed in pvp
[4:31:33] Laythos: ohhhh
[4:31:39] NotSionnix: how do u check how abilities scale in PvP?
[4:31:39] Pontacos: its not 100% dodge its 15% increased by 100%
[4:31:53] Pontacos: the tooltip at least
[4:31:59] LuxtheGod: 30% outside of raid
[4:32:03] Plan: !!
[4:32:09] Pontacos: @LuxtheGod yeah

[4:34:20] Zonnis: i wish you could toggle on pvp patch notes, so you could see what is actually good in pvp and whats nerfed into the ground
[4:34:38] Zonnis: Tool TIps* not patch notes lol
[4:34:48] Laythos: bars ^
[4:34:53] itz_killjoy: death patch + battle masters trinket is good, none of yall use it tho
[4:35:08] Laythos: i think if u inspect while hitting pvp dummy it shows?
[4:35:11] Laythos: could be mega wrong
[4:35:25] Itankarenas: 20% seems kinda bad if it's only 7.5%
[4:35:54] RPGPVP: !followage
[4:36:54] diuoe: sac pact prob scales w vers tho
[4:37:25] Itankarenas: why the fuck dont they show their pvp value on mouseover. blizz legit hates pvpers I swear
[4:37:41] FamLeeGaming: @Itankarenas yup
[4:38:22] Irony3: technically it does change for most things if u hit a pvp dummy
[4:38:26] aaggros: sounds like a good addon
[4:38:26] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[4:38:47] aaggros: true
[4:38:48] Itankarenas: yeah, but what if it was the other way around and they only showed the pvp values unless u hit a pve dummy?
[4:38:55] Itankarenas: pvers would implode
[4:38:55] NotSionnix: i just don't get why its not a feature already smh
[4:39:38] Itankarenas: yeah, it would be a sick addon tho
[4:39:47] aaggros: The fact that you have to use bigdebuffs or something similar,  means that Blizz will never add something so obvious
[4:40:18] Peggytrill69: Evening gamers
[4:44:20] Itankarenas: Sam is rubbing off on Trill monkaW
