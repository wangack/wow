[0:36:34] Ambersulfr: I’m playing the wrong caster
[0:36:41] CoAco95: only 1 guy is having fun in that lobby
[0:36:41] healhut: well, almost everyone

[0:39:33] Jubite: what is this music lol

[0:40:00] Nobody_Hughno: Just learned it on guitar!
[0:40:09] ECH0F0XTR0T: Why is demo any worse then the other specs?
[0:40:42] sadccookie: @ECH0F0XTR0T people just hate the army of pets specs
[0:40:44] fantasiesgx: if there was 1 shaman the lobby would have been a lot harder for you, just no ranged kicks besides the evoker
[0:40:47] Abruty: at least if they would remove the nameplates of all the minor pet and stuff (shaman/hunter included) you dont need to see, would help people play the game
[0:41:17] foxypala: Why do you play demo when destro is significantly better? (according to drustvar anyway especially in the eu)
[0:41:32] Lleo00: MAMA TOLD ME

[0:42:22] Abruty: Prot pal/blood dk time
[0:42:31] CoAco95: blood dk next NODDERS
[0:42:35] o_tho: I’ve been having fun with survival hunter
[0:42:52] Ambersulfr: blood dk is just another dps spec now
[0:43:00] Zarkos: vault tomorrow
[0:43:04] sadccookie: i swear the 1900-2100 mmr bracket is the worst for healers. almost every game someone gets 0 wins or it matches you with people 300+ mmr below you
[0:43:38] foxypala: yeah i agree im hardstuck 2.2 this season as healer ;( 1900-2.1 is aids in 3s
[0:44:00] Ambersulfr: was playing chuck yesterday around 1900
[0:44:18] fantasiesgx: @foxypala exact same problem, for me i just cant get games so im sitting 2.2-2.3 in lfg all day with no biters.
[0:45:09] foxypala: Yeah it's tough, feels like you get that one player who uses 0 defensives and makes the game 3-3 in shuffs also
[0:45:25] fatlittlepaypig: i turned 31 last week and decided to clean shave for the first time in 4 years today. is this a midlife crisis
[0:45:42] fatlittlepaypig: it actually feels so fresh
[0:45:54] MoonKilledSun: how is Restore Shaman in shuffle ??
[0:46:09] foxypala: Depends if the women you like prefer the manly beard xD
[0:46:10] fatlittlepaypig: yea i use the clean and clear face wash in the shower too and it felt so good today lol
[0:46:22] fatlittlepaypig: legit been rubbing my face all day
[0:46:38] fatlittlepaypig: the good old clean and clear babyyy
[0:46:49] Vigi9413: genetics did me dirty and i can't grow a nice beard
[0:47:01] maxdoesmath: What do you think the AWC meta will look like?
[0:47:05] fatlittlepaypig: i look like 10 years younger without one but it does feel way better to not have one
[0:47:06] Jsun99: demo so fun right now
[0:47:10] foxypala: In walks jack reacher
[0:47:15] boomkin_exploit: ya like obama
[0:47:20] Secretwombatbro: my beard is a mental state thermometer
[0:47:47] oruch: nice stream
[0:47:49] CabinetMistake: the wilder the beard the wilder the mental state? lol
[0:47:52] MoonKilledSun: ven how is Restore Shaman in shuffle
[0:47:53] Vigi9413: my wife said she like my long hair over a beard anyway so i guess that's a win lol
[0:48:27] Secretwombatbro: na, its one of those ones that seems to grow more with sadness qq
[0:48:30] foxypala: Vigi, you a old school thor look alike?
[0:48:32] foxypala: xD
[0:48:36] Notty21: is arc start date Friday or Saturday?
[0:48:53] Vigi9413: @foxypala not that manly sadly lol
[0:49:00] foxypala: :L
[0:49:01] Notty21: oops awc not arc
[0:49:26] papaript: Its OK, not everyone can grow a beard
[0:49:48] weevinx: what class are you most excited to see perform in the awc?
[0:50:07] foxypala: What's the player base in pvp like on US servers? an an EU lad it's insanely dead.
[0:50:10] weevinx: sadly I think so too
[0:50:20] RaindaNcex: chunli on ww :D

[0:53:41] bagofcans88: You ever tried much SP? It's like my  10th alt and always looks miserable to play but there's something about it that's addictive
[0:53:43] Vigi9413: this round of trading post wasn't that great
[0:54:10] trikkSP: tell me about it
[0:54:21] joyrex_j9: being a punching bag just fits with the masochist class fantasy
[0:54:23] bagofcans88: Yeah the melee seeking missiles come at you

[1:10:39] Kymagez: i really need to change my dh name
[1:10:41] drbonghitmd: that is what demons look like

[1:11:36] papaript: I think its only affliction that's full mast
[1:11:40] pmakewow: have you tried any mastery on arcane?
[1:11:43] pmakewow: it could be insane with outlaw
[1:11:48] papaript: Demo is mixed and Destro is haste
[1:12:28] pmakewow: i was thinking about running a bit of mastery on tr but im not sure yet
[1:13:01] papaript: NGL, wish Locks were all one secondary to make things easier to test out
[1:13:07] Vigi9413: On TR at least a couple days ago Fury warriors could DW the legendary
[1:13:25] pmakewow: they cant anymore i tried it
[1:13:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: We should see some DK's with the legendary axe
[1:13:54] pmakewow: the execute weapon is going to make the games interesting
[1:14:01] papaript: Im sure some will pop up
[1:14:04] pmakewow: nope
[1:15:02] healhut: dont think blood would work in a tourney setting outside of a troll blind pick or something
[1:15:10] Nachofez: this shuffle queues are criminal, 30 mins into mine at 2k mmr
[1:15:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Could be rets with that legendary axe showing up as a wildcard pick
[1:15:21] pmakewow: theres no reason a caster wouldnt play it i think
[1:15:23] xmostpalone: im not staring at those pants, those pants are staring at me
[1:15:24] pmakewow: becasue its haste versa
[1:15:25] Grimm303: its same ilvl as pvp one so they might as well I think
[1:15:35] healhut: just from watching mes play with it the other night
[1:15:40] pmakewow: maybe even some healers could run it like disc or rdruid
[1:15:55] papaript: They brought a prot pally as a healer not so very long ago lol
[1:16:04] papaript: Anything could happen Monday
[1:16:28] Kramoune: Babooshka is looking goood

[1:17:43] pmakewow: so i dont hvae to experience that
[1:17:45] justjoshingyo: are they going ot nerf blood in pvp sheesh
[1:18:17] Lleo00: if u can keep blood off you he cant heal
[1:18:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: The DK has to death strike to heal, it can be kited some
[1:19:25] anon9753: so cringe seeing people try to jump on the blood dk bandwagon
[1:19:52] fazedoritoss: everyone playing blood dk i hope it gets nerfed now
[1:20:37] ZEXbbot: theyre eating her

[1:22:55] trikkSP: terrible
[1:22:57] anon9753: these players are insanely bad, did nothing the entire game just cant die for 5 minutes
[1:23:02] Lleo00: death strike returns a portion as physical absorb
[1:23:12] Vallekk: blood shield, it's their mastery, death strike heals give you a physical shield
[1:23:40] CabinetMistake: she's a beaut
[1:23:42] fazedoritoss: babooshka is a pretty lady
[1:24:15] leeka: doritoss would make for a good looking demo lock imo
[1:24:16] trikkSP: fk it, kul tiran sp
[1:24:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: What surprises me is that the haymaker usually lands, even with a bit of a cast time
[1:24:47] Sunyankzi: That candle wax falling on her bald head looks pretty painful.
[1:24:56] trikkSP: isnt it a phyiscal cast? should always land?
[1:25:17] CabinetMistake: i think they mean they're surprised people don't move out of it lol
[1:25:21] CabinetMistake: it's kind of a skill shot no?
[1:25:30] dvoraklol: you can emerald communion in sheep?!!
[1:25:32] waterfeesh: Welcome back babooshka :D
[1:25:32] trikkSP: oh like that
[1:25:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah people generally move out of range or use anything to counteract the haymaker... they just get wholloped
[1:26:05] Arubicon: still rocking the awesome tunes i hear Ven..very nice
[1:26:21] trikkSP: haymaker is pretty good on some rgb maps too
[1:26:37] zen_oni_shinobi: runecloth is 8g on my server.

[1:28:43] Arubicon: hell ya
[1:28:45] Osmosses: how do you remove the status 1 bar when your in a arena match?
[1:28:54] waterfeesh: Did ziko respond this time
[1:28:54] Valoroma: trying to hit anything higher than 1600 as arcanse is so hard without 4 set in shuff
[1:29:02] allosear: Trihard o7
[1:29:13] allosear: TriHard o7

[1:30:21] dvoraklol: !followage
[1:30:21] Panda3D: are you vegan?

[1:30:42] danieltsmoke: WTF am I LOOKIN AT?
[1:30:45] thanksfortheresubdude: Fire mage I remember. Also during that the lich King was broken and did stupid damage for a while

[1:31:06] slicesym: babooshka lookin fine
[1:31:09] waterfeesh: Scorch doesnt feel good to hit, just something that does no damage to fish for pyro
[1:31:23] trikkSP: cata fire was pretty good too

[1:31:37] Valoroma: poly is so fun, but then resto happens
[1:31:42] Kymagez: @zachgamegodx may i ask where you hail from ?
[1:31:48] waterfeesh: Cata fire was super fun to set up those GIANT combust dots
[1:31:48] Eversomething: what would you say someone coming back after being away from wow but was casually 2-2.2k rating tbc to legion, would it be hard to relearn?
[1:32:12] voodoodrop: can we ask for a rename??
[1:32:16] waterfeesh: But thats kinda the same problem tho
[1:32:24] waterfeesh: just basically turtled for combust
[1:32:26] fazedoritoss: cata fire mage was so fun where combust was a dog based off ignite damage and u spreaded it with fireblast
[1:32:32] fazedoritoss: dot*

[1:33:59] nankdugz: LOL
[1:34:00] voodoodrop: TBC
[1:34:02] waterfeesh: Fireball if there was a talent to give you a sped up cast of it, and its damage was increased, and it applied a good burn dot that combined or rewarded another dot or combust
[1:34:07] wackpoetic: are you not in queue again as a troll
[1:34:07] waterfeesh: that might be fun
[1:34:11] klocksmith: retail without the disgusting character u have there sou ds nice

[1:35:01] Vallekk: babooshka is a beautiful devastation evoker
[1:35:01] Kymagez: bs
[1:35:05] CabinetMistake: the fact that the color of the candle matches the wings too is rather remarkable
[1:35:05] healhut: FOR GOOD REASON SIR
[1:35:06] voodoodrop: like rn is not only the model.. man i cant follow the arena i am lost
[1:35:08] trikkSP: body type 2

[1:35:15] LegendFromWoW: ya but if I blow out the candle do I get to make a wish
[1:35:18] Freebolt: my god that looks like a literal meme
[1:35:20] Triknology: I pronounce it kul teeran
[1:35:26] Kymagez: i had a female kul tiran but they bnanned the name
[1:35:29] DeityRevert: clearly identifies as a dracthyr, sir
[1:35:32] Triknology: have i been saying it wrong
[1:35:36] voodoodrop: like in pokemon i pref until 1 to 3 after that i am lostt
[1:35:37] Ultramagnus85: ya'll act like female dwarves and taurens or the old troll model are much better
[1:35:42] voodoodrop: gen*
[1:35:53] healhut: they're made up words. no one knows how to say them
[1:35:55] oxphoenixo: those pants are thicc
[1:35:55] thanksfortheresubdude: Bro I saw a kul tiran named Peter Griffin in full family guy transmog it was a divine moment
[1:36:11] nightmxz: the remakes of gen 1 are the best games :) Leaf Green & Fire Red
[1:36:17] Kymagez: @voodoodrop so cause you are confused its bad?
[1:36:21] klocksmith: charmander or squirtle first pick
[1:36:24] danieltsmoke: @venruki Aight dude drop me a basic frost mage opener
[1:36:27] waterfeesh: Its rare, its funny, its devil-ish, and it makes people physically recoil and groan when they die to that mog. Thats why i think its the best lol
[1:36:27] Triknology: Blue red yellow were great, I also had fun with silver/gold/crystal, but stopped after that
[1:36:30] trikkSP: i love gen 4 imo

[1:37:10] voodoodrop: LOL
[1:37:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Big dam
[1:37:23] Vallekk: honestly the pokemon thing is so similar to wow, a lot of people stick hard to the first generations because it's what they love, but also some people appreciate the modern version for the complexities it brings. just like classic and retail
[1:37:24] dailyshuffle: pokemon red was my first gameboy game, best time of my life tbh
[1:37:26] nightmxz: He said basic my boy

[1:47:19] fazedoritoss: kam is insane
[1:47:35] jukeandnuke: is it ever worth trying to spell steal bop? seems like I don't see a lot of high rated players ever trying to spell steal bop or freedom.
[1:47:54] kreyzy8: he stole the ox kick tech
[1:48:39] jukeandnuke: I didn't realize that was even stealable
[1:48:52] CabinetMistake: peepoClap

[1:59:04] Triknology: Is it not the most famous war protest song of all time
[1:59:40] CabinetMistake: yeah just thought it was funny they only knew it from a movie about guns lol

[2:02:27] nankdugz: im likin this
[2:02:48] jukeandnuke: bit of a delay from your voice now - looks like an old japanese movie where the words come and then your mouth moves
[2:02:49] Moobot: Latest video "Blizzard Is Adding An Achievement Mount To The Trading Post" view it here: youtu.be/RSOc2gON7w0
[2:03:04] Hamrock77: nope
[2:03:06] Kymagez: no
[2:03:06] Cephqt: not for me
[2:03:06] Lleo00: looks good to me
[2:03:09] Triknology: seems fine on my end
[2:03:38] Valoroma: Staff or double weps?
[2:04:08] Valoroma: guessing ur just not using staff because IT LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER with a dagger
[2:04:13] Swertson: Swertson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! I'm debating if aff is worth maining
[2:04:35] Swertson: oof
[2:04:42] GogumaCat: wtf is this transmog
[2:04:54] fazedoritoss: i think aff cant ever be op with current design cuz every spell has to be casted
[2:05:03] Valoroma: @Swertson u jsut dont get the burst to end things, so good healers kinda just keep people up
[2:05:19] fazedoritoss: yea anything would be great
[2:05:21] Hamrock77: I liked when Haunt made it strong
[2:05:28] slicesym: the jinx talent helps a lot
[2:05:30] Cephqt: @fazedoritoss every spell??? you mean UA?
[2:05:35] Lleo00: delete it
[2:05:39] yesterday_potato: aff use to be king
[2:05:45] Triknology: Needs more instant casts
[2:05:49] Lleo00: just delete lock and dh
[2:05:52] tv_raz: make it so only ua on 1  target but make the dispell actually lethal
[2:06:02] yesterday_potato: feel like cata
[2:06:05] ATHLTE: wotlk afflic is so fun
[2:06:20] fazedoritoss: they need to give aff the SP treatment where SP has shadow and shadowflame spell school
[2:06:31] dvoraklol: no one ROCKS anymore
[2:06:32] yesterday_potato: feel like mop is when destro rose to dominate
[2:06:33] fazedoritoss: malefic rapture needs to be a different school cuz its ur spender and shadow as buiilder
[2:06:36] trikkSP: def is
[2:06:42] Svettyboosh: Greta van fleet
[2:06:45] Kymagez: not allowed to pull dicks out on stage
[2:06:47] Cephqt: i think its sort of protest/rebel music
[2:06:48] fazedoritoss: and then they dont need to change damage or buff anything it;'ll be fine
[2:06:54] Vigi9413: Vince Neil doesn't even sound like that anymore lol
[2:06:55] Triknology: Motley Crue was just a softy pop band
[2:07:00] Lleo00: theres a few copycat bands
[2:07:01] trikkSP: rock/metal is still popular here in scandinavia atleast.
[2:07:04] yanpity: bro for RGB Demo is good? or destro
[2:07:15] Kymagez: iggy pop was ...
[2:07:29] fistweaveurnan: The issue with making aff dispel lethal or really giving it much more power at all makes splay toxic in ladder. Balancing around shuffle complicates ladder and vice versa
[2:07:31] Random_Uneducated_Viewer: Its 2016 and Ven is about to head into Ashran
[2:07:31] trikkSP: destro is played in rbg
[2:07:35] trikkSP: and aff
[2:07:46] tv_raz: dont know why you would when you could go mass chaos bolt destro
[2:07:46] Hamrock77: I think its needs an identity of rotting enemies, curse focused builds with built in damage and actually big dam haunt or anyother ability. If you can make the bottom 3 talents in their tree around that build that could be fun. UA Corruption and CoA are already built in staples so build off of that.
[2:08:18] LHermite: ven have u ever streamed non wow?
[2:08:18] nightmxz: Idk my solution for the hot and dot specs being toxic (rdruid / afflock) is to make their over times last shorter but do more
[2:08:40] dvoraklol: danzig rocks
[2:08:41] Valoroma: everyone forgets spriest
[2:08:42] Kymagez: check his OF
[2:08:56] Swertson: @venruki what is a good non meta spec to play for fun in shuffles?
[2:09:03] trikkSP: @Swertson dh
[2:09:29] Valoroma: whatever u find fun
[2:09:46] Kymagez: i thought amouranth had a spicy of till i saw vens
[2:11:52] anmusallam: hi venman how are u
[2:13:12] Pock3tsand: got eeeeeeeem
[2:13:30] Kymagez: wtf is this song
[2:13:30] LHermite: when they just stand up after partner dies, you just know they are rage typing
[2:13:38] Kymagez: cant you smell my smell?
[2:13:39] xGriefxGodx: Outlaw is trending toward meta, lets be honest
[2:13:56] dvoraklol: yeeeww
[2:14:05] Kymagez: yeah def luigi
[2:14:28] JunoXGaming: what is this mog!? lmao

[2:14:45] yesterday_potato: rofl
[2:14:46] Hamrock77: oh my god yaaaaas
[2:14:59] Triknology: Especially on a class that has ranged spells >40yds
[2:15:07] healhut: you just like to summon your own npc Kappa
[2:15:08] Kymagez: only when i get to kill van rook
[2:15:08] Dinguslordx: I only have dreams of being able to play WoD ret again.
[2:15:10] yesterday_potato: trolling
[2:15:18] trikkSP: its because you are in there Kappa
[2:15:27] Kymagez: ^
[2:15:32] Sunyankzi: Ashran was amazing during WoD never ending battlegrounds. It gave some awesome titles from the Gladiator building too.
[2:15:36] Triknology: Lol I forgot about Van Rook
[2:15:39] Kymagez: i go for vens toon 1st every time
[2:15:53] Kymagez: van rook the pook
[2:16:04] ItsJhelo: Wanna know if you hate yourself? The answer is yes if every night you log into WoW and que Solo shuff as DPS like me.
[2:16:23] mavy123456: @venbussy do u think arcane mages should be able to spellsteal without any repercussions?

[2:20:43] JuiceBoxDrizzle: Want to play a new healer have mained shaman for a few years any ideas for me?
[2:20:48] Kymagez: i do wonder why your hair is turning into pikaboos though
[2:20:51] Kymagez: concerning

[3:00:40] allenlondon210: spriests seems to have made a comeback
[3:00:46] McLarge: Ele is too streamlined with how frequently it can instant cast Lava Burst, I think. Makes it far too easy to bot with imo.
[3:00:52] Kymagez: @godofrbg really?
[3:01:19] supatease: I thought that paladin was crusader at one point but its not
[3:01:27] ooPickleRicKoo: I am pretty sure I am fighting against hunter bots every day
