[2:16:10] Fatcher: i think its great for the game
[2:16:12] Lansstuss: it's absolute misery and torture as dps
[2:16:22] Fatcher: easily accesible pvp for people to just get on and play
[2:16:25] Lansstuss: you sit 1h in queue just to get unfavorable lobby and get your ass beat
[2:16:26] mike6string: I donâ€™t think itâ€™s good honestly
[2:16:27] Vendrek: It is good. An easier and tougher mode of game play.
[2:16:29] Fatcher: improves population of pvpers
[2:16:31] Abruty: Its good if they can fix the Queues
[2:16:33] ItsJhelo: If they could reduce solo que times by bringing more people to the game I think its amazing
[2:16:36] mzaamentor: it practically killed participation for 3s and 2s
[2:18:02] Vendrek: I have noticed over recent years the path that they want to take forward is catering to solo players instead of groups.
[2:18:07] mzaamentor: The issue is the elitism when it comes to lfg, if you never were 2k before, you'd never get invited and now the 2k turned into a gladiator achievement
