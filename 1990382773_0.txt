[1:20:10] Rhea_the_Cat: @DonReiniero 2h tank is the meta till 40, should mark focus targets if thats the case
[1:20:46] DonReiniero: @NotoriousTWIG ye thats sounds like pain in normal. In HC that will get you killed eventually
[1:20:47] covered137: This quest is death
[1:20:59] rizzpeople: @DansGaming if you are about to die, jump into the water (the outside side not in between the ships) you deaggro all the mobs
[1:21:12] Slaizio: The captain quest is very dangerous alone
