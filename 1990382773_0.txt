[0:31:05] TuxLafitte: Just the stress of keeping an eye on everyones health levels.
[0:31:25] MightyWombat: and as dumb as i am i picked paladin in FF14RR only to learn its one of the harder ones to really get the hang off KEKW

[0:33:18] thescribe0: I remember in vanilla as DPS we almost never got healed in 40mans.  Healing was reserved for tanks.  DPS relied on pots, bandaids, and the occasional AoE heal.
[0:33:21] myth_xy: I miss tanking in an mmorpg. sadly all the current mmorpgs arent appealing to me

[1:20:10] Rhea_the_Cat: @DonReiniero 2h tank is the meta till 40, should mark focus targets if thats the case
[1:20:46] DonReiniero: @NotoriousTWIG ye thats sounds like pain in normal. In HC that will get you killed eventually
[1:20:47] covered137: This quest is death
[1:20:59] rizzpeople: @DansGaming if you are about to die, jump into the water (the outside side not in between the ships) you deaggro all the mobs
[1:21:12] Slaizio: The captain quest is very dangerous alone
