[1:11:23] Chernobyl26: @getmilkherebro0 too much free space below the character, another chat window or perhaps even a 9th or 10th action bar would really go a long way

[1:14:09] NutellaHappens: KEKW

[1:15:15] diaphoresis: did you try turning your fireplace on and off again?
[1:15:25] Chernobyl26: he's laying the bricks of his new fireplace right now

[1:17:13] yoooofi: no premature ejaghoulation ok
[1:17:15] Chernobyl26: woodstoves > fireplaces
[1:17:18] Liidocaine: I have a fireplace and I am never ever going to use it... its just a waste of spcae.
[1:17:22] vargerl: Most houses I feel liek do have fireplaces, but they are natural gas fake ones, not wood burning
[1:17:25] King_nix: Well technically anything can be a fireplace if you try hard enough. A couch fireplace, a bathroom fireplace. Don't let your dreams stay dreams kids
[1:17:44] NutellaHappens: real fireplaces are dangerous
[1:17:53] vargerl: I love my back patio fireplace.. perfect for late fall
[1:18:01] Rykkeee: we rarely use ours but I still live the aesthetic to it. it is indeed a real fireplace
[1:18:06] Chernobyl26: fireplaces are ultra inefficient, since they pull in a ton of cold air, woodstoves are the bis wood burning in home tool
[1:18:08] ãƒ’ãƒƒãƒˆãƒžãƒ³: ghoul modCheck
[1:18:22] King_nix: Some folks in California treat the outdoors as their fireplace even. Mixed results on that one though
[1:18:43] derElten: warlock bing chilling
[1:19:22] Rykkeee: not playing frost in dungeons? this man is dedicated to the morb
[1:19:50] King_nix: sounds very similar to tbc hunter, having to line up CDs and keep the rotation going etc
[1:20:13] vargerl: I've actually enjoyed my swap from Frost to UH. It's not as slow as people say it is, but yes, it's definitely not as interactive/fast as Frost
[1:20:17] Rykkeee: I did my first 25 man on dk last night and was mid rotation on KT, didn't see the void zone right under my feet and got bopped KEKW
[1:20:18] Balruk_: unholy DK reminds me of retail classes, you don't know what abilities are doing what damage but if you mess up your dps sucks

[1:40:08] kooolzin: mages should be good in speedruns with UH dks, right? boss will melt so high uptime in cds
[1:40:31] roagond: was the gem thing nerfed?
[1:40:48] zak618: what's the valor prio list for dk?

[1:48:54] Chernobyl26: except she made amends and still does the same exact thing..

[1:49:12] Rykkeee: you're not dropping 8k on a maybe
[1:49:16] kooolzin: lol, imagine if the deck was rng
[1:49:17] kooolzin: LUL
[1:49:33] Mangomight: well the complete trinket is x2 the price so I thought so xD
[1:49:46] Rykkeee: cause ppl are impatient
[1:49:51] Mangomight: true
[1:49:51] exponentialgrow: the thing that sucks about unholy is you can't get super high parses as alliance
[1:50:11] H3lte: just do frost for 5mans?
[1:50:14] Joben_Cain420: Also bosses die so fast gary doesn't even start attacking till boss is like 70%
[1:50:15] Swordscream: Did the DK gear command get updated?
[1:50:18] ghostpvp: you are in a 5m with double ret paladin with 1 pally buff an crusader aura
[1:50:22] ghostpvp: standard paladin IQ

[1:50:39] MEA_99: you mean to tell me that your class is much worse on its own and is heavily reliant on everything else to buff your damage? REEE
[1:50:41] Rykkeee: u still find yourself following the wa?

[1:51:30] VeZz3: Ty cliped :)
[1:51:40] kooolzin: 52/19/0 for the normal ppl ofc
[1:51:48] cinoz: how far is this character from ready for speedruns?  i'm curious since you like only just started gearing it right?
[1:52:10] ghostpvp: hes prob about a DMF turn in away
[1:52:13] Rykkeee: if u ever get the parry proc thing for frost is that a high prio?
[1:52:25] MEA_99: this is an OG song on the playlist
[1:52:29] cinoz: @ghostpvp awesome!
[1:52:38] zak618: i feel like square bracers would not be comfy
[1:52:56] cinoz: oh cool cool
[1:52:58] Wazed: o shit we main swapped?
[1:53:07] turbulencetoo: !grateful
[1:53:07] Nightbot: For a guy who mainswapped less than a week ago you arent very grateful lol
[1:53:11] cstonedebate: !grateful
[1:53:13] cinoz: ya love to see it
[1:53:26] derElten: !pill
[1:53:26] Nightbot: Streamer is swapping to a DK main for the foreseeable future. His preference is to continue maining warrior, but that isn't a viable option for speedrunning at this stage of the game.
[1:53:32] kooolzin: do you expect 1.12 pservers to make a return after wrath?
[1:54:12] zak618: eoe OH
[1:54:18] DoctorTog: don't forget your sigil Kappa
[1:54:43] exponentialgrow: OS25 helm would be big
[1:54:51] ghostpvp: from your gear here you would be surprised how little any 1-2 pieces actually give you outside of greatness
[1:54:51] cinoz: sweet
[1:54:53] Vaynepref: What about cape? Isn't that the boe gundrak one?
[1:55:08] ghostpvp: Maybe LL is the only other one
[1:55:30] Duckert0n: honestly if you look at top kills people in reasonably meh gear do perfectly fine in morb spec if you play properly and have fast kills. think gear is plenty fine
[1:55:31] MEA_99: I just got it baked in all my abilities. If it ends up griefing me oh well
[1:56:08] MEA_99: Rune strike unironically CLAPS
[1:56:26] ghostpvp: @Duckert0n Greatness is huge but after that yeah
[1:57:07] exponentialgrow: "Dali we need you to come as fury for the speed run"
[1:57:28] zak618: does gary snapshot w/ str too or just haste?
[1:57:35] Rykkeee: army of the dead is bis in 5 mans
[1:57:39] poggersshaman: its not a very big cd so dont worry about it
[1:57:39] ghostpvp: probably just to get the RP to garg faster tbh
[1:57:42] DoctorTog: i think it's gary shit>erw->army normally?
[1:57:59] Axakat: I mean... morb is kinda doggers for dungeons in general. Its a very raid focused spec, so it's kinda wonky to properly play in dungeons haha
[1:58:08] Duckert0n: @ghostpvp it is but im nearly the same boat as dali with just better weps (also no greatness till sunday), last night my guild 24 manned -1 dps and i got 99s as the offspec unholy (im the dk tank) when i played the fight correctly. gear is good but doing the fight correctly goes miles further
[1:58:18] zak618: i'm always afraid to army thinking it's gonna ping pong the boss like it does in dungeons
[1:58:43] Axakat: No, army snapshots too
[1:58:48] kottenkottenkotten: you AOTD in unholy for the haste
[1:58:51] Rykkeee: its bis though
[1:59:00] DoctorTog: blood after army afaik
[1:59:33] daxaa: streamer never wanted to play a pet class, and now hes playing full zoo mode
[1:59:33] Nightbot: Streeeaamerrr!!!1!
[1:59:42] kottenkottenkotten: gary doing 200k and army 100k if snapshotted properly
[1:59:58] Rykkeee: at least army is a 10m cd and doesn't reset on boss, makes it feel more impactful to press the button
[2:00:00] Axakat: Basically IT, PS, BS, dnd, BT, GF, ERW, IT, PS then gary into army. then blood presence and try to press the right buttons KEKL
[2:00:07] DoctorTog: "streamer you got slotted for the speedrun, but what did it cost?" "everything" Sadge
[2:00:47] H3lte: speedruns get too fast for gary Prayge
[2:00:53] zerixx2: u guys can just set the meta
[2:01:12] Beardinate: pray frost do so much trash dmg
[2:01:23] MEA_99: @zerixx2 Yeah exactly. Dali just play frost and be the best frost dk in the world
[2:01:54] DoctorTog: is that the ULTRA RARE AND HARD TO OBTAIN bronze drake mount?
[2:02:08] nax1: pretty sure unholy falls of a cliff when every bis item has arp
[2:02:12] DoctorTog: Yes GIGACHAD
[2:02:18] LEX_FPS_REFUGEE: toothmonger poog
[2:02:22] Axakat: Fury stack bis for 4hm triple cleave ofc ppc

[2:03:02] habanoloco: wait for unholy with t9 setbonus PepeLaugh
[2:03:28] nax1: @kooolzin ur trolling ?
[2:03:30] Grombeere: if anything uh falls of at icc, but it scales really well through togc
[2:03:47] ghostpvp: unholy plateas a little in t8 but after that is all over for the its gets worse copers
[2:03:48] Grombeere: so well that youll still wear t9 in icc in fact
[2:03:55] kottenkottenkotten: so how's UH life? do you feel yourself becoming one with the morb?
[2:04:32] Beardinate: youll always morb
[2:04:34] kooolzin: thats t10
[2:04:35] Axakat: think thats late ulduar or early togc? can't remember tho
[2:04:38] rodemust: when you can stack armor pen
[2:04:44] exponentialgrow: that was on private servers, but apparently the sim is saying Unholy is really crazy even in ICC
[2:04:51] grylz89: srs question. what is the morb spec?
[2:04:51] Nyckfull: have you tried scource striking?
[2:04:58] titi14gooner: u'll still dual wield just add scourge strike to your rotation

[2:05:10] Nyckfull: morbdali Kappa
[2:05:15] DoctorTog: @grylz89 dw unholy stacking a shitton of haste/ap effects to make gargoyle morb out
[2:05:33] grylz89: ahh I see
[2:05:35] habanoloco: theres an unholy talent called morbidity

[2:06:29] ProcessControl: First time?
[2:06:33] DoctorTog: welcome to wintergrasp, it's a small indie company you can't blame blizzard
[2:06:38] vile_aces: weaving scourge strike is actually tier 9 when you get Sigil of Virulence
[2:06:42] amazadin: you're unfriendly for 2 seconds when you zone in
[2:06:46] Ranzorx: normal
[2:06:51] derElten: @SalvDali you cool with me just dumping the export in discord? my brain is apparently too smooth for pastebin

[2:11:20] KeeperOfRats: capture the workshops to get tanks, then break down the walls with siege vehicles
[2:11:41] yoooofi: time for exciting vehicle combat weeeeee
[2:11:47] Haximaxi: grats
[2:11:48] Axakat: Just build catapults. Catapults move faster and faster = more damage
[2:12:18] alterrr: thats what i do :)
[2:13:07] Ranzorx: defending usually wins
[2:13:13] sterlz_the_ok: Defense has advantage

[2:15:35] amazadin: conquest isn't in the game yet - that's cata iirc
[2:15:54] jamesbagster: oh my, PVP!
[2:16:29] amazadin: strand was added in LK again, for some unknown reason. the only BG blizz ever removed from the game because 99.9% of the players blacklisted it
[2:16:35] habanoloco: kill castle or run out of time
[2:16:39] poggersshaman: you have to touch grass inside the base as attacker
[2:16:40] phailix: yup
[2:16:42] zak618: timer up top
[2:16:43] autumntreant4721: @salvdali timer above
[2:16:51] kooolzin: defense wins with timer
[2:17:01] kooolzin: you take 10 minutes off the timer by destroying the south towers
[2:17:27] Axakat: @amazadin Strand is better than isle of conquest at least haha
[2:17:56] lanayiadk: I'm heating some vegetable beef soup. Very comfy in autumn/winter times
[2:18:23] jimjim36: the defenders destroy attacker towers to make them have to defend less
[2:18:23] habanoloco: south towers
[2:18:27] Ranzorx: defenders kill towers to lower time
[2:18:29] KeeperOfRats: you want it to go down you dont have to defend as long
[2:18:32] amazadin: @amazadin both so so so awful
[2:18:41] zak618: my lunch consisted of leftover candy since I only got 15 trick or treaters
[2:19:07] jimjim36: you can just randomly win this game in one big push
[2:19:18] jimjim36: once you're to the middle
[2:19:55] lulle17: if the defenders starts to turtle its hard to win for sure
[2:19:55] daxaa: well, if you play a useless spec, you should prob be the one who use tanks
[2:19:58] Tierceron: Damn 15 trick or treaters? we got 2

[3:43:21] Rafthehalf: oh mb, yeah trying to learn why my priests are fucking us over still 3 years later, once again KEKW
[3:43:39] amazadin: most of the MC issues right now are related to range
[3:44:07] amazadin: since your priests are MCing the second they get into range, if they move the MC target even 1 yard away from themselves once the MC lands, then it will break
[3:44:22] amazadin: they just need to stand still and wait for raz to run in rather than try to run to him
[3:44:22] goldenjerdiss: UH small numbers alkDX
[3:44:54] amazadin: and your OTs need to keep the other mobs relatively close by, so that the same issues don't pop up on re-MCs
[3:45:12] elitemanslayerx: yea we do all that im just assuming they suck
[3:45:18] goldenjerdiss: the damage gets done but theres just no oomph
[3:45:18] amazadin: easy solution, but you need to understand the problem first, rather than blame mechanics that don't exist any more
[3:45:22] porkfist: its so much more fun seeing 60k killing machine howling blasts, this whole "billions of dot ticks" thing is so lame
[3:45:26] elitemanslayerx: cause im first to fucking die when they fuck up everytime and its every pull
[3:45:31] Rafthehalf: @amazadin BIS actually big true, they MC them from the top of the ramp almost xD

[3:59:15] Osskar65: !pill
[3:59:15] Nightbot: Streamer is swapping to a DK main for the foreseeable future. His preference is to continue maining warrior, but that isn't a viable option for speedrunning at this stage of the game.
[3:59:22] Brilliance__: The Next Action WA sometimes has you waste an unholy rune when you dont need it
[4:00:53] Brilliance__: Same with Ghoul Frenzy, which is where having a timer on your DnD helps too

[4:30:37] KeeperOfRats: the faster kill groups just lust on the first spark

[4:37:35] boeglund: FLASH BANG
[4:37:46] Rykkeee: dali do you know how much defense I want to aim for on prot warrior, sorting out my OS set
[4:38:09] Tegridi: 540 defense
[4:38:19] Rykkeee: were you using a w/a to show you that?
[4:38:20] Tegridi: is min, defense still has value over 540!
[4:38:23] Rykkeee: i thought i saw something like that
[4:38:44] jigglypuffgus: Is that the same for DK defense?
[4:38:45] Rykkeee: kk ty
[4:38:50] Tegridi: same for every tank
[4:39:06] bacherman: Same for all tanks, but some have talents
[4:39:11] jigglypuffgus: cool
[4:39:14] bacherman: Druid gets all their crit immunity from talents
[4:39:37] bacherman: Lol
[4:39:49] goldenjerdiss: pally tank GIGACHAD
[4:40:57] gashil: you haven't done 10man 3D yet have you?
[4:41:11] gashil: tried it last night and it's tough
[4:41:15] elcapo63: if you didnt stream, would you lvl that many alts? I find it hard to lvl any alt after the main
[4:41:37] gashil: oooo that's right, repressed memory right there
[4:41:44] goldenjerdiss: zerging it with warrior PepeLaugh
[4:42:18] exponentialgrow: you were putting up sunders
[4:42:52] Rykkeee: So 2 piece deadly gives me 205 resilience, that's probably better for prot huh?
[4:43:17] bacherman: I love how most warrior player in tbc had an enhance alt. They probably played once without enhance in their group and realized the world needed more enhances.
[4:43:43] Jimithings: do you have corpse explosion?
[4:43:59] Jimithings: it's big dam
[4:44:30] PRazmogh: Hey Salv, as a frost DK, at how many mobs would u use dnd? feels always strong but so unrewarding when all runes are on cd...
[4:45:08] Samiolaa: hi can anyone help me find about this wa salv using? im pretty new to uh dk kinda lost with everyrthing
[4:45:18] Jimithings: corpse explosion is pretty easy to spec into, just take a point out of unholy blight which sucks anyway
[4:45:26] gashil: !was @samiolaa

[4:45:31] Nightbot: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v-Qw88nBpZOok22FpiFCRADXvSdW3MB1mtQyPpDOw7A/edit
[4:45:40] Samiolaa: @gashil ty so much mate
[4:45:55] gashil: looking for the fonsas next action one
[4:45:59] Rykkeee: so you want to reach crit cap and then gear for straight avoidance prioritizing shield block rating > dodge parry > block value
[4:46:02] Rykkeee: is that the general gist?
[4:46:12] Chernobyl26: HahahaHAaHAAahahahaAHHAHaahahaAHAHAHHAhahhhhhh
[4:47:34] Tegridi: @Rykkeee for prot? for threat you want expertise and hit, and if you are going for EHP you typically gem and gear into HP over avoidance. Its more bang for your buck. No fight really needs to heavily stack either way right now though
[4:48:11] Tegridi: shield block rating is nice for shield slam damage but devestate and revenge do a lot of threat
[4:48:38] ClouseinddaHouse: shield block value gives shield slam damage rating gives chance to block
[4:48:45] bacherman: @Tegridi Shield block value*
[4:48:52] Tegridi: yea that
[4:49:01] Rykkeee: ok
[4:49:05] Tegridi: i can never remember them salvdaW
[4:49:08] Rykkeee: but either way you like have to be crit immune first and foremost right
[4:49:16] bacherman: Yes
[4:49:17] Tegridi: technically no, but yes
[4:49:27] Rykkeee: and specifically UA
[4:49:30] Rykkeee: for damage
[4:49:31] bacherman: Stamina and crit immune are your most important values
[4:49:32] Rykkeee: all avoidance right
[4:49:39] Tegridi: avoidance better for UA yea
[4:49:54] so_damn_bad: didnt watch his step PepeHands
[4:49:58] bacherman: Avoidance is predominantly an aoe tanking stat
[4:50:01] Tegridi: but expertise still super valuable
[4:50:05] CaptBoot: been feeling like a flammable little insect lately
[4:50:06] bacherman: For UA it's good
[4:50:08] gashil: watch your step
[4:50:21] elcapo63: any ring?
[4:50:23] amazadin: no one wants to res you as a ghoul?
[4:50:24] goldenjerdiss: would ams have saved you there or do the zones do too much damage?
[4:50:28] hovgaardwow: hot take but u should watch ur step
[4:50:30] Kriehp: call DKs Raise Ally on you!
[4:50:45] frichdal: Confirmed Dad reactions
[4:50:53] elcapo63: wait, it reset?
[4:51:21] bacherman: AMS saves you from void zone for sure
[4:51:28] turbulencetoo: YEP watch your yep YEP
[4:51:38] goldenjerdiss: yeah for sure just move, was just asking
[4:51:48] amazadin: but if you plan on getting hit by walls, then AMSing that debuff, you won't have AMS for the void zones
[4:52:04] elcapo63: ban that dude with the HH helm from future run
[4:54:49] swedagawd: is it just me or is the void zone weak aura off as fuck

[4:56:58] Nightbot: Streeeaamerrr!!!1!
[4:57:11] PRazmogh: Hey Dali, as a frost DK, at how many mobs would u use dnd? feels always strong but so unrewarding when all runes are on cd...

[5:15:48] Spencer1234566: thats how I feel about my ret rn Sadge
[5:16:07] sliderWasTaken: warrior were not bad in the beginning of wrath, they were pretty strong, they got nerfed mid expansion
[5:16:13] dirichlet_: I feel more bad for rets, 2.5 xpacks in and they have still never been good
[5:16:29] hypno7iq: hypno7iq subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[5:16:33] Spencer1234566: ret was definitely very good in tbc
[5:16:41] blarsto: Thankfully I'm playing with the same people I did in vanilla. So they know I'm just in the need of a bit of carry before they get smoked again
[5:16:53] blarsto: vanilla classic*
[5:16:54] ashepool: For Mythic Plus Warlock/Hunter were 25-30% higher DPS than everything else.....balance was not great in retail either this year.
[5:16:55] Norrland91: they become better later yes?
[5:16:59] foodtrain: is this DK for more splits?
[5:17:22] sendItLive: I heard part of the reason are since we are in end game talents and patches is a big reason for the warriors hurting so much. Rets are even more so.
[5:17:29] hypno7iq: still a fun class to play
[5:17:33] Chernobyl26: They play ret for the class fantasy ofc
[5:18:15] rezechs: end uf ulduar they will get alot better with buff
[5:18:20] G33k_0ut: huh
[5:18:33] Rykkeee: it was a wake up call in pre patch because you still had the same high gear level and were still bad
[5:19:19] yolo_brah: warrior will be fine in ulduar ret still wont lol
[5:19:20] stuckgrinding: tetsu says warriors arent that badd
[5:19:37] yolo_brah: @stuckgrinding tetsu is full of copium lol
[5:19:54] daxaa: warriors feels good to play, but ye the dmg is shit
[5:19:54] lintyjoo: yeah just enjoy being a turd
[5:19:55] sendItLive: I mean the sub spec rogue is nipping at the fury warriors dps
[5:19:59] samsquantch89: Tetsu is full blown delusional rn
[5:20:01] WallyJustice: 7 gdkps on 7 toons a week is meta
[5:20:02] lintyjoo: ive embraced the turd life as a ret
[5:20:06] blarsto: depends on the pull structure tbh.
[5:20:12] Tegridi: Sucks even more for prot, so fun and good right now but paladins just say F you with their crazy CD's
[5:20:14] lintyjoo: parsing 96-99s and getting lowest on the meters
[5:20:15] Nightbot: Parsing? Really? If you think I'm going to worry about parsing, then you're right. What will my friends and family think about my parses? They're going to say, "we're proud of you."
[5:20:16] roagond: tetsu is very lucky to be fury and get all the loot pretty fast
[5:20:23] Yeeegz: Aren't we supposed to be against the hate train as a warrior community?
[5:20:36] Yeeegz: The warlocks/ rogues are thriving on this
[5:20:55] roagond: also, why not grizzly hills music?
[5:20:58] WallyJustice: everyone rerolled to rogue booomy lock
[5:21:09] NutellaHappens: yes
[5:21:11] Downtime_: Hell yeah
[5:21:12] yolo_brah: warriors just need to chill out for 1 phase they will be fine in ulduar lol
[5:21:21] WallyJustice: then will reroll back to war in icc
[5:21:22] sendItLive: Yeah weird playing the yellow and red over warrior
[5:21:31] Johnnyutah79: Embracing the suck on my mage until ICC
[5:21:35] Osskar65: Always
[5:21:49] Rykkeee: Peepocomfy
[5:21:55] blarsto: any1 with common sense would bring an extra lock over the warr (assuming you get 25% arp) from a rogue
[5:21:55] lanayiadk: Very comfy
[5:21:56] yepclocc: Peepocomfy
[5:22:03] pezinafm: salvdaJAM salvdaJAM salvdaJAM salvdaJAM

[5:22:11] Yeeegz: Yeah we gotta band together
[5:22:19] pezinafm: fitting music KEKW
[5:22:22] helgi125: grizzly music actually hotdog water

[5:22:52] MachaObv: Peepocomfy
[5:22:59] Norrland91: how is arms with the cleave spec on trash?
[5:23:18] invokeraki: war bis confirmed
[5:23:40] yolo_brah: @Norrland91 what trash tho ? naxx trash dies in 2 sec lol
[5:23:45] primecloth: Arms cleve is BIS just get a ravager @SalvDali
[5:23:58] Tegridi: tclap CROGGERS
[5:24:01] dirichlet_: I thought you spam tclap?
[5:24:14] kybosh11: do u believe in wars topping meters in toc or icc?
[5:24:24] Norrland91: @yolo_brah that is true, grasping for straws here
[5:24:31] Rykkeee: I just got 3xScarley Ruby from my Icy Prism salvdaGasm salvdaGasm
[5:25:29] blarsto: tclap increases deepwounds, will be nerfed; once director of arts nephew discovers it
[5:25:50] lanayiadk: Warlock, rogue, death knight seems to be the top damage dealers in phase 1?
[5:26:18] Norrland91: from what I understand you never press mortal strike
[5:26:22] thekumquat99: Tclap's main use is to spread Deep Wounds multiple targets since it crits fairly reliably due to Incite. But since trash just melts so fast at this stage it definitely feels underwhelming. @SalvDali
[5:26:29] Rykkeee: now when we mention warriors being top tier in theory is that on single target ever?
[5:27:05] samsquantch89: Iâ€™m like 90% sure with the buffed ulduar gear, warriors will be good in full ulduar bis
[5:27:15] NsaneTrav561: slam over MS
[5:27:42] Tegridi: maybe we need to use titansteel spellblade
[5:27:48] Tegridi: it works for other classes
[5:27:55] rezechs: Im trying to think how ARP gear can be so huge for warrior to make them go from where they are now to godtier
[5:28:19] dirichlet_: if they were gonna buff naxx health they shouldve buffed trash health too imo
[5:28:24] DoctorTog: @rezechs typically the answer is "arp rage generation is a positive feedback loop"
[5:28:38] rezechs: yea but i mean look @ loatheb dmg
[5:28:39] Yeeegz: Slam is half the rage of MS right
[5:28:46] bacherman: @rezechs It's not just ArP, they have very favorable scaling factors too
[5:28:54] rezechs: arp make warriors instantly top on loatheb if they had it?
[5:28:55] Nightbot: SMOrc Average number go higher but big number less common, grug is confused SMOrc
[5:29:34] chia6251: Wish he would smile more.  He looks unhappy.
[5:29:34] ë…¸ë°”1948: peepoCoffee  Peepocomfy
[5:29:36] Tegridi: AP and weapon damage are still stats
[5:29:43] Norrland91: I saw prefox play arms on beta and he never used MS and spoke with a local arms warrior in guild he also never use it, costs too much rage but idk
[5:29:44] RaymusRtic: Even with 2 set slam is worse then MS. Konter made an in-depth video on what skill does the most dmg
[5:29:51] ë…¸ë°”1948: KEKW

[5:30:42] chia6251: eyes bleeding, says I'm having fun
[5:30:58] DoctorTog: slam is wep+250 / 15 rage / 1.5s (delay swing?) and ms is wep+380 / 30 rage / instant, so like maybe, MAYBE with tier slam could be better than ms but
[5:31:13] Rykkeee: KEKW

[5:31:54] DoctorTog: it's probably very close with tier tbh
[5:32:11] DoctorTog: min maxing the lowest dps though to stay 11th FeelsBadMAn
[5:32:20] jeneraljelly: can you modify sim ability prio
[5:32:21] thekumquat99: Pretty sure the reason Slam outperforms MS in this phase is because 1) t7 2-set is justa flat 10% Slam dmg increase 2) standard Arms talents dont include 3/3 in Imp MS and you don't run the Glyph of MS either.
[5:32:33] Norrland91: @DoctorTog KEKW
[5:32:56] Rykkeee: my cousins step-brother that works at blizzard told me slam is better, trust me.
[5:32:57] DoctorTog: does the 2-set bonus include the wep damage part of slam? or is it just the bonus damage?
[5:33:02] dinkletv: you're telling me you dont know the guy, who knows the GUY, who knows prefox?
[5:33:05] exponentialgrow: are you thinking about leveling a draenei dk on the 3rd account?
[5:33:09] thekumquat99: I've read that it's when you get your t8 4-set that you start speccing into stuff that buff your MS, like the talent I mentioned above + the glyph
[5:33:42] thekumquat99: I thought that Weapon Expertise 2/2 + Angert management was the way to go, instead of 3/3 Imp MS
[5:34:05] primecloth: Draenei warrior chad next
[5:34:35] yepclocc: Peepocomfy
[5:34:38] sendItLive: That was my thought process for my dk for gdkp
[5:34:40] Mangomight: the ability to look good is x10 worth hit chance
[5:34:46] Arbiterz: delete pagle
[5:34:49] nyonmage: do u ever plan on using ur college degree
[5:35:24] vile_aces: has to be full capped
[5:35:29] ExhibitB: music going crazy lmao
[5:35:56] NsaneTrav561: lets not BS here , your hate for certain specs ..cough. cough unholy and arms which you have/had to play. you half ass on research related to rotations
[5:36:33] NsaneTrav561: so why do you come off like knowing it
[5:36:37] NsaneTrav561: when someone tells you
[5:36:50] RaymusRtic: I going to put the math man for arms in the discord for you
[5:36:56] sliderWasTaken: because noone ever lied in twitch chat
[5:36:59] nyonmage: thoughts on necro futa milk
[5:36:59] Nightbot: no think, only zug
[5:37:12] turbulencetoo: alright its almost 5pm time to start needling the streamer
[5:37:12] amazadin: he's asking for proof lol, and no one seems to be able to prove anything
[5:37:20] amazadin: in twitch chat at least
[5:37:26] NsaneTrav561: best way to know if things work is look at logs for top players
[5:37:28] exponentialgrow: you are only allowed give advice if you are the most knowledgable person in a field streamer
[5:37:30] NsaneTrav561: that's all the proof
[5:37:41] NsaneTrav561: its a start
[5:37:47] nyonmage: yodie gang
[5:38:15] Norrland91: OK I lied it didn't come from Prefox I read it in my Mongolion basket weaving group on facebook
[5:38:17] DoctorTog: the top rank arms parse on patch does only have 1 ms
[5:38:23] DoctorTog: so maybe ms isn't worth
[5:38:37] RaymusRtic: Even with 2 set for slam, MS has a nigher ceiling for crit damage
[5:38:55] DoctorTog: also mobility factor
[5:39:05] DoctorTog: like if you're constantly moving standing still for slam can be a bit monka
[5:39:10] NsaneTrav561: you use MS with moving targets
[5:39:16] NsaneTrav561: since slam won't work
[5:40:06] turbulencetoo: best way to smoke em out is to aggro a bunch of them on to you
[5:40:10] turbulencetoo: and then bomb them
[5:40:13] thekumquat99: Def MS on trash when there's a lot of movement involved. Same case on bosses assuming you can't fill that gcd with an Overpower or Execute.
[5:40:14] turbulencetoo: just dont die lol
[5:40:18] Rykkeee: im also surprised to see slam doing so well for fury, i know in pre patch i didnt prio the slam procs over bt/ww but now it seems like the play is always prio slam procs
[5:40:21] turbulencetoo: not those though lol
[5:40:23] vile_aces: they are in the huts on the shore
[5:40:23] turbulencetoo: Stragglers
[5:40:24] thesupplier69: theyre in the cabins i think
[5:40:33] Kriehp: not these
[5:40:39] RaymusRtic: There is a barn with 10 of them
[5:40:43] samsquantch89: @rykkeee everything Iâ€™ve seen says donâ€™t prio slam procs over BT/ww
[5:41:35] monkie31: !weakaura
[5:41:36] Nightbot: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v-Qw88nBpZOok22FpiFCRADXvSdW3MB1mtQyPpDOw7A/edit?usp=sharing
[5:41:36] Rykkeee: well i did some sims and slam had highest damage per rage, and if you use slam proc first then other abilities give option for more slam procs
[5:42:01] rtcinema: When I sim the highest dps prio is WW > BT > Slam
[5:42:16] Rykkeee: im pretty rage starved though
[5:42:30] samsquantch89: @rtcinema yeah that sounds more accurate
[5:42:33] DoctorTog: tbf to the arms thing too: the 2nd and 3rd patch parses had a lot of slams cast so even if slam is better i think it's very close and probably within like, crit rng
[5:43:00] Rykkeee: I'd have to do more of my own research, but our fury warrior main is a guru on fight club and swears by it
[5:43:06] tumey23: got my betrayer last night gonna go fury next week
[5:43:12] DoctorTog: er,,, a lot of MS casts
[5:43:13] DoctorTog: typo
[5:43:48] nyonmage: i probly have to do more research but im faded than a hoe yodie gang shall we
[5:43:54] pezinafm: fight club enthusiasts KEKW
[5:44:09] turbulencetoo: if you aggro the whole building then you can smoke more than one or two at a time
[5:44:15] Yeeegz: The slam thing is something fight club said right?
[5:44:15] jigglypuffgus: Do you look at the latest DPS rankings for interest?
[5:44:16] Rykkeee: questing rather than boosting in HoS now?
[5:45:03] Kriehp: mhh crusty flatbread
[5:45:21] pezinafm: death coil sigil kinda nice too
[5:45:58] nyonmage: who do u have winning finals skt or drx
[5:46:17] jigglypuffgus: Can I link it to hear your opinion?
[5:46:30] jigglypuffgus: https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/news/wrath-classic-dps-rankings-phase-1-week-4-naxxramas-eye-of-eternity-obsidian-329643?webhook
[5:46:38] NutellaHappens: faker Pog
[5:46:39] MachaObv: SKT duh
[5:46:44] Firebloom: SKT , faker GOAT
[5:46:46] nyonmage: drx takes it
[5:47:00] Rykkeee: fury warrior salvdaStonks salvdaStonks salvdaStonks salvdaStonks salvdaStonks
[5:47:02] DoctorTog: those rankings suck lmao, the thing they claim as overall damage isn't
[5:47:04] ë…¸ë°”1948: fury > ret
[5:47:07] turbulencetoo: tough week for subtlety rogue Sadge
[5:47:10] rezechs: Enhance is getting HUGE
[5:47:12] thekumquat99: @Gustimation wrong game bud haha
[5:47:23] Unleaded321: PogU
[5:47:25] Biggie6242: SoonTM they'll be back on top
[5:47:29] samsquantch89: KEKW
[5:47:36] rezechs: 95% kek
[5:47:37] Rykkeee: demo still above affliction, probably the last week
[5:48:13] Tegridi: I prefer this one: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1023805854077694002/1029447482935083118/unknown.png
[5:48:19] DoctorTog: I'm fairly confident, based on my knowledge of WCL, that they're claiming those rankings to be boss + trash which isn't true since you can't view that on the stats page on wcl
[5:48:26] sonowoah: At least youâ€™re not gladiator warrior
[5:48:34] ë…¸ë°”1948: KEKW
[5:48:42] Rykkeee: i thought that was SWP or something lol
[5:49:00] DoctorTog: it's boss + adds damage for "damage"
[5:49:02] DoctorTog: there's two images
[5:49:15] DoctorTog: and "damage to bosses" is "boss without add damage"
[5:49:46] misterf0010: one day copium
[5:49:48] Rykkeee: just wait until bloodvine boys
[5:49:50] Rykkeee: warrior will rise
[5:50:31] DoctorTog: some WHAT
[5:50:33] DoctorTog: oh
[5:50:38] Biggie6242: salvdaSoon salvdaSoon
[5:50:40] ë…¸ë°”1948: s u c c
[5:51:07] primecloth: jokes on you i already failed that challenge
[5:51:29] Rykkeee: respec fury right now
[5:51:31] Rykkeee: at the very least
[5:51:32] rezechs: 1 day he shall rise from the ashes
[5:51:34] Yeeegz: Fury next reset though?
[5:51:38] jigglypuffgus: Can you go fury now it's an alt?
[5:51:56] Mangomight: Pretty insane how a class can go from last to first in the span of an expansion
[5:52:30] Rykkeee: does it say arms sunday?
[5:52:49] Rykkeee: POGGERS
[5:52:53] roagond: pog
[5:52:54] NutellaHappens: Pog TIME TO PUMPO
[5:52:57] yepclocc: HYPERS
[5:52:58] Tegridi: Not fiery?
[5:53:24] Rykkeee: I got pretty good gear and am parsing 80+ and it still feels Sadge
[5:53:31] OhnTV: it feels like you do dmg, but you don't really. on trash its really good though
[5:53:45] elcapo63: u can always farm more gold
[5:53:51] bambucha34: is grim toll bis for fury?
[5:53:52] lintyjoo: just buy another nobles deck?
[5:54:01] Mangomight: pretty sure you use greatness to togc and by then warr will start to do dmg Prayge
[5:54:08] gryphsx: Just buy another Kappa
[5:54:15] roagond: how much is the deck now?
[5:54:46] bambucha34: so warr doesn't want sarth trinket?
[5:55:14] exponentialgrow: will the alt DK be ready in time?
[5:55:20] NutellaHappens: follow the Copium and believe in SalvDali in the future
[5:55:21] charburst: I say the Warrior
[5:55:25] exponentialgrow: oh nvm you can just turn in
[5:55:36] primecloth: give it to the shaman
[5:55:48] Rykkeee: i simmed the sarth trinket lower than mirror actually
[5:55:51] elcapo63: fuck it, give it to the mage
[5:55:53] mir3ib: love the main switch Dali best of luck
[5:55:55] cybots: will the warrior just be doing gdkp from now on?
[5:55:57] jigglypuffgus: defo warrior
[5:56:25] Yeeegz: warrior
[5:56:29] zormaan: its 320 ap
[5:56:33] charburst: It's your comfort zone.
[5:56:34] Rykkeee: warrior for sure
[5:56:54] foodtrain: !main
[5:56:54] Nightbot: Whatever character streamer is playing on stream = his main. Facts are facts.
[5:57:10] charburst: You will ALWAYS end up back at the warrior. VoteYea
[5:57:41] dmtSabra: @charburst at the latest in F R E S H with worldbuffs
[5:58:19] primecloth: will you ever switch to the mage for speed running if that becomes more viable?
[5:58:56] jigglypuffgus: Is there any difference between a warrior alt and main in this guild ? ðŸ˜‰
[5:58:57] Van_Klinken: I stopped playing at tbc but was is the reason fury has dropped so much in single target dps?
[5:59:26] rezechs: fire has no mana issues even for aoe
[5:59:35] roagond: will you need to bring 1 arcane for 3% when fire is be better
[5:59:43] rezechs: u regen mana from living bomb
[6:00:07] Rykkeee: just meta swap helmet EZ
[6:00:29] rezechs: yea true but iirc icc trash is alot more thicker than naxx
[6:01:05] Mangomight: you ever think it will be warlock stack?
[6:01:15] rezechs: ret in icc is big with t10
[6:01:16] exponentialgrow: nah ret always stinks
[6:01:29] Kwoku: @SalvDali do you think top guilds will speedrun twice a week now that its easier to get a right comp (and its easier to gear alts)
[6:02:20] Rykkeee: Theres a "dreamstate" holy pally build that goes into the 3% damage talent, Prayge that it ends up being good so mage isnt forced to arcane
[6:02:40] rezechs: china just rents toons lol
[6:02:47] daxaa: i opend the stream and got a doritos commercial, very fitting
[6:02:56] primecloth: Just have 10 alts
[6:03:13] Liidocaine: @daxaa non sub  Redsiren
[6:04:03] Norrland91: abit wrong if they are swiping for gold
[6:04:09] Kenny_Marsh: stack rogues and UH DK
[6:04:16] Kenny_Marsh: tricks OP
[6:04:19] UhhAndrew: with shadowmourne
[6:04:28] primecloth: the ret tier set is really good
[6:04:34] roagond: in icc they have good set for aoe i heard
[6:04:36] rezechs: aoe
[6:04:36] whoisc0pe1questionmark: everything
[6:04:36] Kenny_Marsh: They have 0 threat issues
[6:04:42] exponentialgrow: better on massive pulls
[6:05:08] samsquantch89: Because no guild has 15 good unholy DKs. It was different in classic bc warrior was the clear bis class so everyone had one
[6:05:12] Van_Klinken: You can sap trashmobs Kappa
[6:05:17] exponentialgrow: feral bearweavers have threat issues
[6:05:25] woodehxx: The ret talents for the last patch were balanced around T10 set bonus'
[6:05:55] DoctorTog: more time to helm slurp-- oh
[6:06:04] rezechs: rogues can just move and aoe DKs need dnd
[6:06:08] top_deckz: chat don't sweat it Dali will NEVER acknowledge rogues even if they're the best by 10k dps
[6:06:12] top_deckz: KEKW
[6:06:49] dinkletv: would you want to keep mobs alive, to spread diseases quicker?
[6:07:02] rezechs: rogue is literally just fan tho
[6:07:44] Mangomight: Rogues need to respec tho for aoe, which is kinda bad if ur holding down W
[6:08:03] rezechs: What about boomkin stack LUL
[6:08:08] exponentialgrow: seems like way more daggers drop than DK weapons, so a rogue stack would be nice for gearing
[6:08:25] abefrman: @SalvDali do Raz first, Keep MCing and healing it
[6:08:53] Tegridi: who cares theyre rogues
[6:08:53] samsquantch89: You can stay one spec, they just get a little worse
[6:09:12] Mangomight: depends, its a scuffed version of combat
[6:09:18] Murloc_Investigator: I heard you were fishing today and commenting on delete pagle memes today, salvdaSadgeflower  that I missed it
[6:09:41] Murloc_Investigator: I know I know
[6:09:42] Murloc_Investigator: I heard
[6:09:50] Liidocaine: DELETE PAGLE
[6:09:55] Murloc_Investigator: Would have had WORDS if you picked the wrong side
[6:09:59] Murloc_Investigator: WOW
[6:10:00] Murloc_Investigator: 15
[6:10:04] Murloc_Investigator: proud of you champ
[6:10:54] Kwoku: i loved nagrand sucking
[6:11:09] primecloth: Since warriors are really bad atm does that discourage you from leveling salvador?
[6:12:08] Chernobyl26: did we get the mail opening?
[6:12:47] dinkletv: is there room for open communication regarsing sped run strats in progress? or do leadership tend to stick to their own ideas etc?
[6:12:48] Chernobyl26: fuck, been in and out of meetings all day
[6:12:56] Chernobyl26: Sorry honey, there's a new SalvDali VoD
[6:13:40] Rykkeee: HES IN LOVE WITH THE MORB
[6:13:43] Rykkeee: IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME BOYS
[6:13:55] Murloc_Investigator: !discord
[6:13:56] Nightbot: This channel has a discord! Join so you can call me bad outside of the stream. SeemsGood https://discord.gg/Apg8QTd
[6:13:57] Nolan5011: I keep getting you at the end of your streams sadge
