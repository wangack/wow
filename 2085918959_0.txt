[0:03:10] wackpoetic: "Resolved an issue that prevented the 50% PvP reduction to the Throw Glaive cast by Screaming Torchfiend's Brutality (2-piece) from being applied." does anyone know how often this was occurring? like how much free DPS did DH have because of a bug lol
[0:03:15] satirically1: already had my morning coffee but morning with ven works too :)

[0:04:36] Varaben: LIL IL QT
[0:04:36] fridxa: @venruki do yoy think fire will be playable after buffs?
[0:04:40] fridxa: You
[0:04:53] williwhite94: ahhh ok
[0:05:19] Rupeltinski: after buff for mage what is the best spec?
[0:05:35] caroltheman1: will DH be playable finally ?
[0:05:36] Paybacks: is this net buff to fistweaver technically? :(
[0:05:43] donnydonawitzz: couple of the buffs look decent, the nerfs seem kind of lacking
[0:06:10] fridxa: Im glad they nerfed Outlaw, now I'll finally don't feel like chump playing Sub or Assa
[0:06:23] wackpoetic: do an RBG
[0:06:23] Jihnn: Did you turn in the quest?
[0:06:30] satirically1: did you get the 12 round quest?
[0:06:30] williwhite94: man i just watched the walking dead with the new rick episode on YT SHIZZ IS WILDDD
[0:06:35] zachgamegodx: hey duide
[0:06:37] williwhite94: do yuo watch walking dead @venruki
[0:06:39] wackpoetic: pretty sure RBG win gives you a half spark
[0:06:42] caroltheman1: gotta trust the process
[0:06:59] williwhite94: BRO IT IS CRAZY not the same story line AT ALL
[0:07:03] 서약님: Good morning beef steak, Sir ven.
[0:07:45] JBugaboo: fourth mage?
[0:08:01] nameyourform: MVQs tweet is fried.
[0:08:02] williwhite94: i think people are mad about DH not being nerfed to the ground
[0:08:06] JBugaboo: you got another account?
[0:08:20] Kalakbar: all of mvq's tweets are fried
[0:08:23] caroltheman1: I think since the changes took so long they wanted certain classes punished for being OP
[0:08:27] dakotan517: @Kalakbar big true
[0:08:31] Bwrecker: Gmorning
[0:08:37] turblow09: living bomb gona be worth it with changes?
[0:08:45] zachgamegodx: @turblow09 unlikely due to its cd
[0:08:50] Bodify: mvq gonna have to play the same game as everyone else unlucky
[0:08:50] Smexxin: mvq takes
[0:08:51] nameyourform: his class got nerfed lmfao
[0:08:54] nameyourform: I torn you
[0:08:56] nameyourform: he’s fried
[0:08:58] Kalakbar: hello~
[0:09:03] zachgamegodx: oh HISSSS class got nerfed
[0:09:05] zachgamegodx: got ya
[0:09:09] Varaben: DH got such minor nerfs didnt they
[0:09:09] Kalakbar: just took another dose of the MAGIC JUICE yesterday Pog
[0:09:10] wackpoetic: bro the biggest change looked like a bug fix how are DH's gonna say anything
[0:09:17] williwhite94: @turblow09 i think with damage modifers from other classes it might be in AOE situations but def not good single target
[0:09:24] JBugaboo: hes just trying to cope like the mage discord to get minor changes reverted
[0:09:36] wackpoetic: Resolved an issue that prevented the 50% PvP reduction to the Throw Glaive cast by Screaming Torchfiend's Brutality (2-piece) from being applied. - like this could easily be the biggest nerf right?
[0:09:41] venruki: !youtube
[0:09:41] Moobot: @venruki YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[0:09:53] big_hero_d: Guys Im thinking about next alt in this off season what you recommend rogue or feral
[0:09:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Venruki got DH nerfed LUL
[0:10:03] zachgamegodx: ven with his click bait
[0:10:05] zachgamegodx: KEKW
[0:10:19] Kalakbar: morroHmm what I'm looking for isn't in me, that's why I needed a prescription for T
[0:10:22] modsbruto: did you serve, mr.ruki ?
[0:10:25] Finicky____: The English recuitment ads go hard
[0:10:26] Skillcap: yoooo ven what up, like the tuning? KEKW
[0:10:34] zachgamegodx: the casual players are BEGGING
[0:10:35] williwhite94: @wEiRdO_dUdE those nerfs wont do anything tho lol their damage will still be nutty and nether walk and shit still makes them crazy OP
[0:10:52] SoulLessDestroy: At least the good thing is that Ret didn't get nerfed
[0:10:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure, they could have nerfed the heck out of death sweep
[0:11:07] zachgamegodx: dh wall isnt that good
[0:11:13] zachgamegodx: its just short cd
[0:11:15] Skillcap: fair
[0:11:15] JBugaboo: i had a dh do 3 mil with that flying up ability and dropping bombs lmao
[0:11:18] FateIRL: they need to gut dh
[0:11:28] FateIRL: make it unplayable
[0:11:29] zachgamegodx: dh wall is one of the easiest to kill thru as a caster
[0:11:37] zachgamegodx: without their dmg reductgion passive
[0:11:41] williwhite94: i mean i started Dh a week ago got it fully geared and im able to 1v3 people i didnt even read the talents
[0:11:48] Taevenx: idk why people expect classes to feel punished after blizz leaves them uncheceked
[0:11:52] poasa21: hi @venruki when’s the podcast come out?
[0:11:54] FateIRL: they need to remove glimpse too
[0:11:55] Skillcap: will fire mages be the play now?
[0:12:14] davErosEe: their set bonus got fixed which is a decent dmg nerf
[0:12:17] zachgamegodx: ven with frost bolt build im getting pretty big amt of my dmg as flurry
[0:12:24] nightmxz: I might actually play this for fire  https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/fire/DAPFRBFQRRVQVWgUUUBANVUVCYVEVRUVIECRQ
[0:12:28] nightmxz: depending on meteor dam though
[0:12:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Fire could be really nuts
[0:12:46] zachgamegodx: isnt hypothermia cool
[0:12:47] williwhite94: removing glimpse and when nether walking healing reduced by atleast 20% while nether walking and reducing all damage by 10% would be nice
[0:12:56] williwhite94: that would be good IMO
[0:13:09] man0litos: @venruki TO be fair i think everyone is surprised glimpse or blur is not touched. Also a bit light  on the warlock nerfs and weird mage nerf since its one of the low damage casters
[0:13:10] Varaben: i saw paramore in concert a few months ago, they were so good
[0:13:14] Kalakbar: you're pretty cool
[0:13:16] jiffyjake: there's no way they don't nerf fire after all of this lmao
[0:13:16] zachgamegodx: is wildfire that good?
[0:13:32] zachgamegodx: couldnt u save a point by putting 2 in flame accelerant
[0:13:38] zachgamegodx: ah
[0:13:44] jiffyjake: its 50% nerfed in pvp, wildfire
[0:14:01] Thasta: living bomb gonna crank tho?
[0:14:13] zachgamegodx: is there a possible build where u could play all haste and disregard mastery stuff?
[0:14:15] zachgamegodx: or is it just imposs
[0:14:21] JBugaboo: why void elf
[0:14:34] Skillcap: i think haste will be the way again
[0:14:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Living bomb is going to be like the old days where you're in big trouble if it's on you
[0:14:39] Voriq: Good afternoon Ven and chat snupyHey
[0:14:44] Mahoneyy: hey buddy
[0:14:49] Peachxp_: wish healers had 2 charges of dispel lol
[0:14:54] zachgamegodx: i feel like every class feels better with haste
[0:15:18] JBugaboo: not monk lmao
[0:15:27] zachgamegodx: except DH where u get 20% haste as a demon or wahtever
[0:15:41] Skillcap: DKs got forgotten sadly.. still waiting on that frost rework
[0:15:54] zachgamegodx: and rogues have the 1 s gcd too
[0:16:10] Taevenx: what's this song??
[0:16:13] NovaSun84: is this In Flames now playing?
[0:16:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Season 4 is going to have a bunch of tuning, too
[0:16:20] grimmjowhd: bunch of doom posters
[0:16:28] Taevenx: TY sir
[0:16:37] NovaSun84: kevinc70Devil got it
[0:16:38] Kalakbar: KEKL
[0:16:41] harrystyIez: im so excited for the re release re release of classic
[0:16:44] harrystyIez: i cant wait
[0:16:45] grimmjowhd: LOLOL
[0:16:46] Voriq: Thats bait
[0:16:48] zachgamegodx: that guy hasnt touched wow since shadowlands
[0:16:48] harrystyIez: i kid i kid
[0:16:49] Kalakbar: PS I don't play a DH
[0:16:49] Skillcap: holyyy cope on a stack
[0:16:50] JBugaboo: lmao the ladder says otherwise
[0:16:50] wackpoetic: 1.5m dmg in 1.5 seconds rukiHmm
[0:16:55] urukubars: typical dhs being upseet
[0:16:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Venruki getting people nerfed  again LUL
[0:17:05] Peachxp_: Outlaw dmg shoulda been hit, DH dmg hit harder and mmr charged a bit needed forsure  and my biased opinion is hpal is too squishy
[0:17:08] xNotMat: Sup Ven
[0:17:23] zachgamegodx: ven after wheel shenangians, what class do u actually feel like ur falling in love with
[0:17:24] zachgamegodx: sv hunter?
[0:17:29] NovaSun84: makes sense.  I was told in wotlk classic that you can get a 5k GS in 30 minutes "if you know how to play"  lizzNODDERS
[0:17:53] zen_oni_shinobi: nice
[0:18:10] xNotMat: Fave class other than mage? The exact number 2?
[0:18:12] man0litos: isnt the marks hunter weird as well ?  on my mage i get hit around 350 sniper shots
[0:18:13] man0litos: xD
[0:18:18] NovaSun84: lauren254Eeveenotes
[0:18:19] man0litos: Survival is the best hunter spec!
[0:18:29] zachgamegodx: i guess u gotta find where they overlap and bind buttons accordingly
[0:18:29] driftwood_tc: I made a ret pala. Its perfect for my room temp IQ, very simple SMOrc
[0:18:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: feral just needs more survivability and to be able to play without cycloning people, imo DxCat
[0:18:42] Skillcap: story of my life.. always playing smth different never going over 1900 -_- but it gets boring no?
[0:18:50] buffnac: next season they’ll be insane with the tier with these buffs
[0:18:55] NovaSun84: so like 2 million damage in 2 seconds?  Or is it way more?  zoewreCheeky
[0:18:56] Jihnn: The Mongoose Strike buff is crazy, something like 20ish% buff
[0:19:02] nightmxz: I think they should have just buffed the defensive part of survival mastery but what do I know :)
[0:19:11] xNotMat: @NovaSun84 lmao
[0:19:13] man0litos: He is correct, your damage in setups is really good
[0:19:15] Meadamemnon: hunter suffers from the same issue as ENH, survivability is the issue not damage @venruki
[0:19:17] zachgamegodx: i was running sting liek a bee over float like a butterfly most games anyway so idk if outlaw will be any worse
[0:19:23] zachgamegodx: take your cut buff def hurts a bit
[0:19:23] nightmxz: Not necessarily, just micro tune it til it's good
[0:19:24] nameyourform: rat is a cornball
[0:19:27] davErosEe: blizzard always buffs dmg when specs needs defensives
[0:19:34] jayyArrington: WHO LOVE ENHANCE BUFFS
[0:19:34] Zenlyn: if they buffed sv mastery they would heal more than DH's hitting a level 5 critter
[0:19:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Thug Cleave might be rocking out with the changes yeah
[0:19:41] Smexxin: game is generally unfun when more classes are durable and dont die
[0:19:45] Smexxin: for me at least
[0:20:08] LokaJay: Hey Ven and chat
[0:20:15] spacho2032: Is frost better then arcane mage?
[0:20:19] man0litos: Its okish
[0:20:19] Koraszdormu: What's good, Ven.  How you doing today brother?
[0:20:21] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:20:39] man0litos: They have good cooldowns. Yeah they are not demo hunters but they have a number of coolkdowns
[0:20:51] Kalakbar: did you ask for entire balance of the bank as well?  KEKW
[0:20:57] Taevenx: ran to the bank? should have drove Kappa
[0:20:59] zachgamegodx: you went to a bank with bank robber outfit?
[0:21:01] NovaSun84: justinegRofl
[0:21:01] Zenlyn: its REALLY REALLY easy to heal bicmex, but then i go down 1 tier to even a gladiator level sv hunter and it becomes the hardest thing ever
[0:21:01] zachgamegodx: all sweaty
[0:21:06] Thasta: bank robber ven
[0:21:07] Zenlyn: SV is just really hard to play at a high level

[0:21:09] NovaSun84: hands in the front pockets too I'm sure
[0:21:14] NovaSun84: just full bobczaEmo mode
[0:21:20] wackpoetic: also had a sore throat so you wore a mask and wrote what you wanted on a note
[0:21:26] Zenlyn: that's good imo
[0:21:36] Kujo_XX: As long as they're balanced at that cap
[0:21:37] davErosEe: yeah it’s fine, if you want an easy spec play bm
[0:21:37] man0litos: Yesa
[0:21:37] xNotMat: Good for vets, HORRENDOUS for new players
[0:21:38] nightmxz: It's good imo, but the disparity is a little too large
[0:21:39] Meadamemnon: @venruki absolutely, not every spec should be for everyone
[0:21:40] nightmxz: just a little
[0:21:48] NovaSun84: as long as 1 or 2 other specs are simple to play yes.
[0:21:49] man0litos: Makes the game interesting
[0:22:01] nikthevoker: BM is easy
[0:22:02] sqsitv: thats fine but its bad if the braindead classes are op af
[0:22:04] NovaSun84: if the full class is high skill cap then no
[0:22:05] zachgamegodx: im in the minority and i think mw will actually be really decent after those changes, they needed a slight boost to recovery heal bc their hots are so short
[0:22:10] Zenlyn: they should only balance for the bottom 99%, never for the top 1%. I saw in a lot of the changes, i could correlate most of those changes to something that happend in the AWC and i dislike that
[0:22:12] davErosEe: they don’t even have to pick a different class they have 2 other specs
[0:22:12] Geowind: is resto shaman easy for solo shuffle
[0:22:15] zachgamegodx: when they come outta cc they need to have to heal fast
[0:22:19] xNotMat: No no, but wow pop is dwindling, new players can pop into 1800 straight off the cuff
[0:22:28] xNotMat: with zero knowledge
[0:22:34] xNotMat: = WoW aint for me
[0:22:54] Smexxin: what changes make you feel liek that? @Zenlyn
[0:22:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Disc might be back on the table
[0:23:06] spacho2032: What’s the best mage spec rn?
[0:23:09] NovaSun84: whoa, I just brainblasted... I don't play rogue cause I'm the 99% that pleb
[0:23:09] xNotMat: (i've played wow for 16 years)
[0:23:14] xNotMat: Not talking about me, just for new players
[0:23:20] zachgamegodx: nono, @wEiRdO_dUdE the change is completely irrelevant
[0:23:24] Koraszdormu: I can't wait for the MW buffs that we didn't need but we're getting anyways.  Gonna weave those mists so good.
[0:23:27] zachgamegodx: and yeah games will be slower
[0:23:30] raiden996: Fire or frost after buffs?
[0:23:32] zachgamegodx: disc will suck more i think
[0:23:39] nikthevoker: why wasnt DH 2set nerfed
[0:23:45] Kalakbar: bees?
[0:23:56] zachgamegodx: im afraid of demo frost mage
[0:23:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: @zachgamegodx No
[0:23:57] NovaSun84: rogues in chat, if i am going 80 as rogue first time ever.  What spec allows me to DPS.  Single target.
[0:24:01] Koraszdormu: I feel like Casted MW was actually in a good place.  With these buffs, Casted MW is gonna be in an amazing place.
[0:24:04] Jihnn: Here we go, Venruki wants Ret nerfed again Kappa
[0:24:08] Zenlyn: m,y league game has started, just mean with the outlaw nerfs, the haste buff change, the warlock nerf
[0:24:10] dipicat: i second that fear
[0:24:18] dipicat: comp was already the best non rogue / dh comp
[0:24:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Smite does quite a bit for disc priest, even though I think it's dorky
[0:24:28] NovaSun84: Jihnn sjcreaGiggle
[0:24:30] zachgamegodx: frost was already 2nd hand buff whenever dh gets nerfed, but getting direct buffs on the less clunky build seems really op
[0:24:36] Axtin: its already crazy
[0:24:37] Varaben: ret war fist is zug cubed and that doesnt feel great for the game
[0:24:37] Zenlyn: I dont think some of the changes woukd've happend without awc i meant
[0:24:40] NovaSun84: he played DH for a couple weeks.  Nerfed.  Coincidence?  rukiCanadaEh
[0:24:42] dipicat: every season end we have been spammed w ret war fw so far of dragonflight
[0:24:56] Drockzoids: Good lord man, open your unopened item
[0:24:57] spacho2032: Is frost best mage spec rn?
[0:24:57] Axtin: only thing that’ll stop ret war fw is frost mage
[0:25:00] dipicat: frost boomy idk
[0:25:01] dipicat: yeah
[0:25:06] nikthevoker: @venruki fdk/dragon
[0:25:08] Smexxin: god comp back on the menu
[0:25:09] NovaSun84: locl/DH chads are RAGING today after patches
[0:25:09] dipicat: i think the key is cyclone
[0:25:14] Meadamemnon: what are we really talking about here? we are afraid of the current 5th best comp still being good because of rogue/DH nerfs? like thats a bit much
[0:25:28] zachgamegodx: what do u think of soulburn change? alot of lock mains are mad, alot of non lock mains are happy
[0:25:36] kasieus: do u play any other games
[0:25:38] bllazzin: i just made a frost mage today, can i get a tdlr? =]
[0:25:42] dipicat: @Meadamemnon this comment is a bit much compared to any other thoughts shared jebus
[0:25:52] Peachxp_: we've spotted a FW abuser boys
[0:26:00] Axtin: i wanted to see a nerf to dark pact
[0:26:07] Meadamemnon: @dipicat rukiCool
[0:26:07] zachgamegodx: yeah
[0:26:16] Paybacks: isnt nerfing defense for aff super sus though? feel like it just dies
[0:26:24] zachgamegodx: i like mosst the changes
[0:26:31] zachgamegodx: i think some shaman things are a little too strong
[0:26:37] Meadamemnon: i hate FW btw
[0:26:41] zachgamegodx: they're creating alot of issues in themselves
[0:26:48] jayyArrington: enhance buffs OP
[0:26:53] NovaSun84: zoewrePause
[0:26:54] dipicat: its not bugged it just doesnt show on details
[0:27:00] dipicat: the bug was it didnt show on details
[0:27:03] Proffzx: nerfing arcane; ring of fire, is just Dumb.
[0:27:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: I agree the tunings are pretty good
[0:27:04] dipicat: so nobody knew to kill it
[0:27:05] dipicat: last season
[0:27:09] zachgamegodx: it's giving u pve regen
[0:27:17] NovaSun84: addon being bugged makes sense to me tbh
[0:27:20] dipicat: at least thats the only one i knew
[0:27:20] zachgamegodx: i told u that when u asked few days ago
[0:27:30] nightmxz: #DeleteRingOfFire
[0:27:32] Varaben: supa talked about ring of fire too muchj
[0:27:44] Varaben: yeah give mages a little bit of dmg across the board and remove it
[0:27:47] zachgamegodx: i did say nerf ring of fire and buff other dam
[0:28:02] Proffzx: mages are almost always bottom damage, and now you took away our top damage ability across 3 specs?
[0:28:05] davErosEe: will fire still run glass cannon or drop it?
[0:28:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ring of fire being a % base, that damage went way up with the stamina increase
[0:28:08] Proffzx: it’s a huge nerf nobody is talking about
[0:28:09] snow377: hey chat does having the 12 side button mouse that good for wow? im using a normal mouse with 2 side buttons atm
[0:28:15] diirtybum: mage has to many buttons for me
[0:28:16] tv_raz: wheres toxxy roxxy been? havent seen him on in a bit
[0:28:20] nikthevoker: can i get a non nerfed tier set for pvp almost all lsesaon
[0:28:29] nightmxz: I never even played ring of fire and I was topping dmage some games lmao
[0:28:34] dipicat: @nikthevoker boomy 4pc is literally bugged the wrong way so its unplayable lmao
[0:28:37] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy SpacemanJohn WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:28:38] Varaben: i do kind of liek the idea that frost mage does some fire damage though, feels mage-y
[0:28:47] SpacemanJohn: SpacemanJohn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! yo
[0:28:58] NovaSun84: was ring of fire winning games consistently for people?
[0:28:59] dipicat: bro im playin survival hunter too!
[0:29:01] dipicat: DIPIWOLF
[0:29:11] dipicat: woof woof
[0:29:11] zachgamegodx: he started playing it b4 buffs
[0:29:21] dipicat: yeah im literally playing before tuesday too BRO
[0:29:22] Proffzx: fire mage got buffs to stuff we don’t use. and then they buff hunters, eles, warriors, classes that are always top damage. it just doesn’t make sense
[0:29:23] JustTaki: FOM reroller confirmed Kappa

[0:39:39] azliaris1: it neeeds to be target=party1
[0:39:39] Jihnn: /use [harm,@player][help] Roar of Sacrifice
[0:39:43] rainmannxz: POGGERS optimal performance
[0:40:10] Jihnn: I assume you want to cast Roar of Sacrifce on yourself if you have an enemy targeted, and the target if it is an ally
[0:40:19] zyzzmirrin2021: Why ven, I missed before what's you're opinion on the upcomeing DH changes?

[0:41:09] rainmannxz: EZ I believe
[0:41:33] zachgamegodx: ven i think the reason why these macros arent working is because what ur asking is the default function of the button isnt it?
[0:42:22] zachgamegodx: do you h ave auto self cast in ur interface combat options? you shouldnt need amacro for what ur asking for haha
[0:42:29] rainmannxz: EZ warning bomb

[2:06:56] Msv2: ez
[2:07:03] nameyourform: you using shadow word pain with catharthis?
[2:07:06] nameyourform: its big dmg
[2:07:10] nameyourform: with tier set
[2:07:38] setbackttv: I was using that ire build but i started blowing up charts with Stahps build, just sit back PVE and live
[2:08:19] killer9298: yeah the spam dispel on dots is very annoying, happens all the time on my boomy
[2:08:23] setbackttv: Insidious ire to benefit from it you basically gotta DP and torrent next global cus of duration, it does huge dam if you can get it off tho
[2:08:46] ginyu_music: becca?
[2:08:51] driftwood_tc: Looking where big butt? Link pls
[2:09:00] killer9298: demon hunters

[2:11:38] Schwenkyytv: its like being an enh shaman
[2:11:38] sixthycent: bro wait till you can play with Wizk on your frost mage tuesday
[2:11:40] arcane_p: I logged on assa rogue late last night for the first time in months and I forgot how fun retail pvp is,  so fast and so fun
[2:11:41] sixthycent: it will be insane
[2:11:46] fridowskiy: scuffed lobby ngl
[2:11:47] Msv2: SPriests are lowkey tanks
[2:11:47] sixthycent: frost mage SP is back baby
[2:11:47] boomkin_exploit: u mad?
[2:12:02] hotstriketv: i really dont understand how blizzard gives melees this much power
[2:12:11] malvarcla: you gotta kite more Kappa
[2:12:15] asloff: it could always be worse, you could be a hunter... xarDownbad
[2:12:15] hotstriketv: xD
[2:13:04] Snohconez: dh is just hilarious and they barely touched them
[2:14:11] nameyourform: make sure to keep flash heal up for the dmg reduction
[2:14:19] arcane_p: what's your bagel toppings of choice...do you guys do cream cheese and jelly in Canada?
[2:14:21] hotstriketv: if they balance dh, every dh insta swap to new op class, its a never ending circle without good game developers
[2:14:24] fridxa: It's almost like dhs are op huh
[2:14:31] ATHLTE: dhs 400cr above where they should be LUL
[2:14:38] driftwood_tc: Is the DH nerfs coming enough though?
[2:14:40] Peachxp_: those baby nerfs surely fix arena
[2:14:45] veltrinor: dhs wont be able to do as good on any other class in the game
[2:14:45] boomkin_exploit: has a demon hunter ever lost a shuffle game except to another demon hunter?
[2:14:46] Msv2: I think if I resub I might just play DH
[2:14:48] Lemurion1: don't worry the nerfs will fix dhs :)
[2:14:52] killer9298: yeah thats the sad part for me in ss, you either lose because of someone losing your healer or theres a dh
[2:15:04] killer9298: LOSing*
[2:15:09] fridxa: Imagine all the fotm dh cry when dh gets nerfed again
[2:15:25] mrxilio: they DH nerfs coming are the equivalent of trimming their fingernails
[2:16:16] buffnac: the bug fix is the biggest nerf but yeah other than that
[2:16:22] Lemurion1: @fridxa they are not fotm they are all main, like the main rets after the rework
[2:16:49] Msv2: Love too see it =p
[2:17:03] Talisble: ven that shaman is a friend of mine, dont listen to him dont go 3-3
[2:17:05] setbackttv: With tormented spirit build, its same playstyle but its way more passive dam so u just rot all
[2:17:43] Zerikko: Is distorted reality ever worth running?
[2:17:45] Lemurion1: free dispel
[2:18:53] Lemurion1: @venruki spriest is omega fun but it does feel miserable atm doesn't it?
[2:18:53] Mahoneyy: <3
[2:19:22] arcane_p: shadwopriest is not fun when watching it for everything you said
[2:19:22] Smexxin: whats your top 3 most fun specs to play in the game right now if you had to pick
[2:19:24] fridxa: spriest feels great in non 3 melee lobbies
[2:19:30] arcane_p: makes me not want to try it
[2:19:31] boomkin_exploit: and their healer is a sham so u have ground/sheer to deal wtih too :)
[2:19:35] cavi_tv: HAHA SURV
[2:19:36] ginyu_music: your wheel is rigged
[2:19:38] Skillcap: i stopped playing SP after being trained by 2 melees every game.. cant deal with it -_-

[2:20:02] nameyourform: flavor of the monthsss
[2:20:19] arcane_p: ret pally is kinda fun
[2:20:21] buffnac: dh is fun even when it sucks just cuz zoomies
[2:20:22] Snohconez: they dont have many bad matchups
[2:20:25] Schwenkyytv: i wish i liked the lore and fantasy of mages
[2:20:27] Snohconez: good into everything
[2:20:27] Lemurion1: and the most miserables? not counting fury or frost dks or enhance cause they don't exist
[2:20:27] georgeyboy: thats cos theyre busted
[2:20:30] Hobblefoot: Hahaha I love that criteria. Legit makes sense.
[2:20:40] asloff: i dont care for the "never cast" playstyle destro has become
[2:20:42] Mahoneyy: @venruki cant wait to sit in another 30 minute queue
[2:20:44] setbackttv: I been loving my SP, gettin 2400 shuffle on it was a work out

[2:21:18] buffnac: sv/mm/dh are my top 3
[2:21:25] setbackttv: though the insidious ire build it feels so pressured to get off your DP and insta torrent to max value it
[2:21:30] setbackttv: hard without coordination
[2:21:37] Lemurion1: @setbackttv playing tradtional sw death spec or something diferent mor rot oriented?
[2:21:52] setbackttv: I been playing Stahps rot build, just triple dot and massive passive dam
[2:21:53] Hobblefoot: Fury, Arms, Frost DK, Unholy DK, Sub, Outlaw, Sin, Enh, Ele, Disc, Holy P, Holy Pally, Ret Pally, WW, BM, Surv, MM, Devo, Pres, Shadow, Aff, Demo, Destro .... uh.... cant think
[2:22:05] setbackttv: same death spec 4 set
[2:22:13] FateIRL: yes
[2:22:15] Lemurion1: @setbackttv do you have the link for it if you don't mind? :)
[2:22:16] OokleB: yes!
[2:22:31] Smexxin: fury > spriest > dev > aff probably
[2:22:38] buffnac: feel like sv/arms are the S+ tier of spec designs
[2:22:39] boomkin_exploit: do u think its always going to be the case that being fun and strong are the same?
[2:22:42] setbackttv: ya, i saw him streaming it and blasting dam so i yoinked it lol @Lemurion1
[2:22:44] setbackttv: BIQA0Hr2WRGgVq7/s2iQ2HhjlEkEAAAAAAAAAAAAAISKSaJRJlDkkkERSDgkkEpRKISCKlUCJBNkA
[2:22:49] Smexxin: not design but just fun
[2:22:52] leeka: fury hurt my fingers in mage tower
[2:22:55] zachgamegodx: u said most fun
[2:22:56] Smexxin: think it has a good flow
[2:22:57] fridowskiy: fury is awesome
[2:22:58] Lemurion1: @setbackttv ty mate!!!!
[2:22:59] fridowskiy: just zug zug
[2:23:01] Hobblefoot: @venruki Oh no... I was just lisiting specs. LOL
[2:23:05] Msv2: I do love fury
[2:23:10] driftwood_tc: Ret
[2:23:12] setbackttv: @Lemurion1 legit just triple dot and do dam
[2:23:12] georgeyboy: Enhance
[2:23:15] FateIRL: arms war
[2:23:15] Msv2: Fury for sure
[2:23:16] maxdoesmath: ethical lmao
[2:23:17] roughknuckle: frost dk
[2:23:18] otinabas: mop demo lock

[2:23:24] buffnac: sv/arms
[2:23:26] Mahoneyy: rsham
[2:23:31] famous1939: hpriest
[2:23:32] setbackttv: SV/SP are really engaging/fun specs
[2:23:33] Adessius: @otinabas this must be @leeka on an alt account
[2:23:35] jcaraques: augmantation and theres no competance
[2:23:37] OokleB: How mutch is it to learn and gear catchup now from like the end of s2? i maxxed out then and got duelist, how long would it take to get back into the groove you think and some usable gear? TwitchPrime!
[2:23:37] allforgold: i love survival
[2:23:38] zachgamegodx: don’t throw ethical in there
[2:23:39] darrenchen2000: best designed spec is prob rsham
[2:23:41] asloff: mm hunter, but we need defensive buffs
[2:23:42] ItsBees: I can :3
[2:23:43] Mahoneyy: i can duel you
[2:23:43] killer9298: i miss metamorph locks in mop
[2:23:46] deadmanwalkn1329: Fury is a blast and no on expects it
[2:23:54] Msv2: Lol
[2:23:58] Jarettol: spriest...arms war...resto shaman
[2:23:58] zachgamegodx: it’s just 2 different questions Imo
[2:24:01] Msv2: Word police
[2:24:02] leeka: @Adessius lolol
[2:24:06] lordwizardmonk: @venruki typically fun for me is playing the weaker classes because I am usually really good at whatever I play so I like to be at a disadvantage and overcome it
[2:24:08] Adessius: @leeka :)
[2:24:09] zachgamegodx: nah
[2:24:09] Smexxin: disc, arms, spriest maybe for me? i think disc is awesome
[2:24:32] setbackttv: chakram/explosive/flank and fury of eagle does big dam
[2:24:37] ladidaada: Frost mage, cause burst ist almost always telegraphed and kickable
[2:24:42] buffnac: can just send that shit whenver you want, i like to use it for mobility
[2:24:45] setbackttv: Not you first go, i do it like 2nd, im always watching Bicmex
[2:24:47] setbackttv: it seems like what he does
[2:24:49] skez_live: I like the idea/playstyle of disc but i just think we need some help somewhere, i always feel behind
[2:24:51] alexhasabear: coordinated assault is just for the improved kill shot tbh and a gap closer
[2:25:00] alexhasabear: watch bicmex recent vid
[2:25:15] zachgamegodx: demon hunter has a good desihn, but probably not considered ethical for example
[2:25:16] buffnac: sv cds arent game breaking on the timing of them
[2:25:25] Skillcap: coordinated assault is nice if u have the last talent for the bomb resets tho
[2:25:28] ginyu_music: disc needs door of shadows back
[2:25:30] NozakGaming: I would take shadowmend back as disc
[2:25:32] Mahoneyy: @venruki do you have a rat mage you would try ele/frost with?
[2:25:32] setbackttv: Ven, Do this > Hunter mark > Chakram/Explose> flanking > fury of eage
[2:25:35] hotstriketv: disc is so fun, but other heals are just stronger
[2:25:38] skez_live: The design is awesome, but atonement is kinda like worthess right now
[2:25:38] boomkin_exploit: feels too reliant on CDs
[2:25:39] driftwood_tc: Disc doesnt feel like a dmg / heal build that much imo
[2:25:40] skez_live: maybe the buff will help
[2:25:45] setbackttv: BIG DAM
[2:25:50] Cocoapuffs1: fury of eagle into flanking i feel like
[2:25:50] Snohconez: dont think ven has 4 set yet
[2:25:51] Msv2: Healers need better buttonz
[2:25:55] Robofat: @setbackttv flankin gives focus - no point to press it too early
[2:26:03] zachgamegodx: disc just doesn’t heal and they keep buffing random dmg spells and atonement thinking it’s gonna do something
[2:26:03] Axtin: i dont like how disc and holy priest are unkillable, focused will passive is giga broken
[2:26:04] alexhasabear: bomb first
[2:26:16] setbackttv: @Robofat flanking hits for like 90-100k
[2:26:36] hotstriketv: would game be more fun if all gap closers had 100% longer cd?
[2:26:44] Robofat: bomb-bomb-explosive-chacram-asscault-eagle-bomb-fish for enchanted killshots with bleed
[2:26:53] Robofat: @setbackttv no
[2:27:02] Cocoapuffs1: disc and holy also cant move so they can just get trained down if they didnt have
[2:27:04] skez_live: after Tuesday patch I'm going to try to make an actual attonement build and see if it works
[2:27:13] Axtin: out of all healers id bet money that disc and hpriest have the lowest death rate
[2:27:13] FateIRL: flanking is a gap closer
[2:27:25] Cocoapuffs1: priest has no mobility so they need passive dam reduction
[2:27:30] Robofat: you can refill focus when raptor spam
[2:27:30] lordwizardmonk: since im so good I like to play bad classes
[2:27:31] zachgamegodx: not really cause the only thing that can Stun  them off a pillar is a melee
[2:27:31] backstreetalright: I can’t wait for the hybrid builds to come out
[2:27:35] MaximumnNeo: @Axtin they also suck tho, so theres that
[2:27:36] Robofat: at high taptor stacks
[2:27:39] MaximumnNeo: holy you just run out of healing
[2:27:40] zachgamegodx: and melee proc focused will
[2:27:41] Aggro068: I think its fine that you can't kill all healers. It helps them play aggressive too
[2:27:41] Robofat: raptor*
[2:27:43] MaximumnNeo: disc is garbage
[2:27:46] setbackttv: I was just trying to emulate what bicmex did in the fastest 100-0 video
[2:27:53] setbackttv: Works for me most of time xd
[2:28:03] Smexxin: feel like that statistic isnt exactly great though, melees are quite a bit better than casters at killing healers in general
[2:28:04] Olmoscheeks: hunters mark, explosive, chak, fury eagle cancel with bomb, flanking, bomb. That was one from bic.
[2:28:07] zachgamegodx: only time I’ve seen disc die is a late game swap or a dumb dispels
[2:28:07] MaximumnNeo: holy works well for a few comps at least
[2:28:08] Cocoapuffs1: every other healer has ways to kite people except priest
[2:28:18] Mahoneyy: @Smexxin have you tried thunder yet this ssn?
[2:28:31] setbackttv: @Olmoscheeks ty!
[2:29:04] setbackttv: ran of out of gold? @venruki
[2:29:20] Smexxin: nah i havent, seems like it could be good
[2:29:24] ItsBees: LUL
[2:29:50] setbackttv: This is Bicmex's BiS list for SV

[2:30:22] IrishEthics: the tier set isnt great either
[2:30:24] IrishEthics: for disc
[2:30:27] otacmilan57: what is current song name  ?
[2:30:27] zachgamegodx: the fury warr execute buff is interesting, it can alresdy hit nearly 150 k if both attacks  crit
[2:30:28] andyloltv: tier is bad
[2:30:36] amgine04: around if you want 2s in b/w q's
[2:30:38] noukee: the main problem of disc is, that disc brings nothing special for all comps. the dmg is average, no good cc, not good in slow paced arena games (high damp). my idea is, give as disc a talent, that gives maybe 5m more for fear range or smth and little other adjustments
[2:30:43] MaximumnNeo: they have a trash tier set, and no big recovery heals.
[2:30:44] willie_stroker_99: Disc is perfect for 2v2
[2:30:45] Peachxp_: oom but momentum is always been too important for them when a discs team all falls 30% its like pretty sure they die within 20 seconds
[2:30:47] Cocoapuffs1: revolving around penance is pretty shit design imo
[2:30:49] MaximumnNeo: if people just chain kick penance, they just cant do much
[2:30:52] zachgamegodx: but don’t think fury is ever gonna own with no anti cc and 90 s healer trinket
[2:31:11] Axtin: fear is a pretty good cc for 30 sec cd
[2:31:12] CarlisleX: @venruki is your "fast gearing" video still good to follow?
[2:31:12] backstreetalright: disc is just shield shield shield
[2:31:24] zachgamegodx: i don’t think fears need anymore buffs
[2:31:33] MaximumnNeo: @Axtin it is, but getting into position to get a fear without being cc'd 40 times is hard
[2:31:40] skez_live: doit!
[2:31:41] zachgamegodx: disc needs a 400% buff on atonement healing from dots
[2:31:43] noukee: or invis fear
[2:31:45] noukee: like in mop
[2:32:02] Mahoneyy: @Smexxin if dh got nerfed a little bit more - ifeel like it would be better than ele/dh
[2:32:03] Moobot: Latest video "We FINALLY Got More PvP Tuning For 10.2.5" view it here: youtu.be/RK3L29NPNig
[2:32:16] Axtin: @MaximumnNeo yea but thats usually fixed by having coordination with ur team, like in jungle something is stunned and trapped and its usually a free fear off trap
[2:32:17] boomkin_exploit: protection warrior SUCKS
[2:32:42] peeachy8: your pet is cute
[2:33:13] MaximumnNeo: @Axtin sure thats true. but i dont know why you wouldnt play holy instead of disc in jungle. I think its just better in most ways.
[2:33:13] backstreetalright: i like to go mid normal mog and mid transmog to honor the classic wow
[2:33:19] MaximumnNeo: Also most of us are shuffle plebs, so that never happens
[2:33:21] MaximumnNeo: lol
[2:33:40] StromicusRex: hes so unhappy he's struggling to speaklol
[2:33:52] asloff: lul, no
[2:33:53] Axtin: nah
[2:33:55] FateIRL: lmao no
[2:34:04] asloff: hunter too squish still
[2:34:09] maxdoesmath: cupid > jungle still I think
[2:34:18] freelofear: kittycleave is BACK baby
[2:34:21] MaximumnNeo: survival is such a fun spec, its just very hard to live with all the Zug
[2:34:23] Axtin: jungle just gets clapped by rogue comps and ret warr
[2:34:31] maxdoesmath: hunter need ret for survive
[2:34:36] setbackttv: @MaximumnNeo Bic said if you die as SV its your fault
[2:34:39] 5tarchild: what was the site u used to check peoples pvp?
[2:34:40] setbackttv: in his recent vid
[2:34:45] Olmoscheeks: do you track the pet auto attack at all during coord assault? Usually using kill command before kill shot will proc it for the 50% bleed damage from a kill shot crit
[2:34:50] MaximumnNeo: @setbackttv i thin its fair to say most people arent as good as Bic
[2:35:01] Axtin: do u have auto self cast enabled
[2:35:02] zachgamegodx: it’s cause ur not using auto self cast
[2:35:19] zachgamegodx: interface combat
[2:35:30] setbackttv: @MaximumnNeo If we can even be 50% of Bic on SV you can get big rating and dam
[2:35:36] magebrainx: show macro
[2:35:42] zachgamegodx: use no macro
[2:35:46] zachgamegodx: for both skills
[2:35:47] MaximumnNeo: your toggle is bound
[2:35:50] LocoBandito96: why not mm?

[2:36:26] Lemurion1: isn't a pvp talent or a pet type skill?
[2:36:27] zachgamegodx: i think you have the pet ability
[2:36:28] peeachy8: lol
[2:36:33] zachgamegodx: from the pet bar
[2:36:40] Cocoapuffs1: its command pet
[2:36:47] Olmoscheeks: @locobandito96 Huge surivival buffs in a few days
[2:36:58] zachgamegodx: for me I don’t need one
[2:37:18] Drockzoids: Try @self?
[2:37:24] fridxa: Your eagle is very furious @venruki
[2:37:40] Jihnn: Can you try: /use [harm,@player][help] Command Pet
[2:37:51] fridxa: yeah, its too bloated
[2:37:55] Jihnn: Command Pet rather than Master's Call
[2:38:00] Cocoapuffs1: yeah its command pet
[2:38:07] fridxa: but if they removed it it would feel like bm
[2:38:07] zachgamegodx: idk why it’s not working
[2:38:09] kultaporkkana: get the spell from ur spellbook and try reload
[2:38:19] Robofat: spearhead is a damage cd
[2:38:26] magebrainx: try this:::  #showtooltip /cast [harm,nodead][@player] Master's Call; Master's Call
[2:38:29] zachgamegodx: change use to cast
[2:38:30] Axtin: yea the macro ur trying to make should work baseline with no macro for any ability
[2:38:35] Axtin: weird
[2:38:40] thewy: surv is so much fun but i feel like its just a 2v2 spec unless ur bicmex
[2:38:45] thewy: i had tons of fun on it in SL
[2:38:53] konglarsen: Go to pet abilities and shift click.
[2:38:55] Olmoscheeks: spearhead is for sure underwhelming
[2:39:28] zachgamegodx: which one
[2:39:31] fridxa: why surv even has so many gap closer when almost everything is ranged
[2:39:34] Robofat: i like buffed fury of the eagle
[2:39:35] fridxa: closers
[2:39:42] Robofat: 65% hp +50% crit
[2:39:48] ferahgok: @Axtin Have you ever tried full haste feral? The gcds and clone cast feel amazing. though I'm wondering if it makes the damage too low
[2:39:54] kultaporkkana: open ur spellbook and get it from thre to ur bars
[2:40:00] zachgamegodx: ok time to investigate again
[2:40:05] magebrainx: okay then try adding [] after the [player] in the first part
[2:40:06] zachgamegodx: i only looked into ros
[2:40:23] Axtin: @ferahgok yea ive tried it, feels insane and weak at the same time not sure
[2:40:31] l3k13: why do you even need it macroed?
[2:40:33] magebrainx: put [] after [@player]
[2:40:33] Chillatech: frost buffs babay
[2:40:35] kultaporkkana: Just drag it from spellbook?
[2:40:42] kultaporkkana: whit no macro
[2:41:03] amgine04: maybe change nodead to exists
[2:41:08] ItsBees: I'm with chat, I don't have a macro for my MM hunter, what's the macro for?
[2:41:12] Bonquieshaa: #showtooltip  /cast [target=player] Master's Call
[2:41:17] Bigvuqoffdam: can we seee the wheel
[2:41:24] fridxa: They should fix so no ears clip

[2:41:42] kultaporkkana: yes
[2:41:43] kultaporkkana: 1000%
[2:41:46] kultaporkkana: u got 2

[2:41:55] fridxa: Mousters Calls
[2:41:57] wackpoetic: you can shift+click it out of spell book
[2:41:58] jporter_: #showtooltip /cast [target=player] Master's Call
[2:41:58] Axtin: shift click the spell from ur spell book into the macro
[2:41:59] kultaporkkana: open spellbook
[2:41:59] magebrainx: add empty brackets after [@player] like "[]"
[2:42:00] boomkin_exploit: flame him
[2:42:12] setbackttv: ur macro says harm
[2:42:13] caring_bull: @venruki what song is playing, please?
[2:42:17] setbackttv: #showtooltip Master's Call /cast [@player] Master's Call
[2:42:20] kultaporkkana: Thats the wrong one
[2:42:26] kultaporkkana: u took pet
[2:42:27] Olmoscheeks: #showtooltip Command pet /stopcasting /cast [@mouseover,exists,noharm][@player] Master’s call; Master’s call /cast Command Pet Is from Bicmex but someone prob already sent or isn’t what you want
[2:42:28] kultaporkkana: skill
[2:42:28] setbackttv: i just linked you mine
[2:42:33] kultaporkkana: U took pet skill
[2:42:37] kultaporkkana: take it from ur own spel
[2:42:42] magebrainx: Olmoscheeks i dont think he wants the mouseover component
[2:42:44] Drockzoids: Put brackets in before master's call?  /cast [@player][] Master's Call
[2:43:01] Olmoscheeks: ah I see
[2:43:01] magebrainx: Drockzoids ive been spamming that lol
[2:43:15] kultaporkkana: U need to take it from SPELLBOOK anad ur own spells not from pet spells
[2:43:15] boomkin_exploit: supatease?
[2:43:17] fridxa: why there is only 2 dh in lobby? shouldnt there be 3?
[2:43:36] Drockzoids: @magebrainx Ahh, lol didn't see it
[2:44:48] kultaporkkana: U need to take it from SPELLBOOK where ur own spells are not from pet spells @venruki The name is the same on both so it buggs it.
[2:44:51] Waptap: hunter defensives am I right
[2:44:53] Waptap: lol
[2:44:57] Waptap: So hyped for surv buffs
[2:45:03] setbackttv: #showtooltip Master's Call /cast [@player] Master's Call
[2:45:06] kultaporkkana: dont make macro
[2:45:07] magebrainx: dude just add brakcets
[2:45:07] setbackttv: use that one
[2:45:08] magebrainx: its simple
[2:45:13] kultaporkkana: just drag it to bar
[2:45:15] jporter_: #showtooltip Master's Call /cast [@player] Master's Call

[2:45:53] jporter_: hes back
[2:46:02] zachgamegodx: does it work on others tho
[2:46:29] lordwizardmonk: @zachgamegodx I know but what I was saying is that i am typically really good so like to play at a disadvantage and still win
[2:46:38] kultaporkkana: @zachgamegodx yes if u target them
[2:47:28] setbackttv: @venruki one of the things i noticed was Bicmex trys not to overlap RoS or Wall. He spaces em and uses wall first
[2:47:29] fridxa: hunters are so squishy
[2:47:37] setbackttv: He's also ranged more often
[2:47:53] setbackttv: I was dying on my hunter
[2:47:54] zachgamegodx: give him vip
[2:47:54] setbackttv: being balls deep
[2:47:55] sober_toaster: ohhh survival games TwitchConHYPE
[2:48:09] lordwizardmonk: no, we can teach you
[2:48:11] Cent82: push buttons harder
[2:48:14] Skillcap: shouldnt it be the opposite? KEKW
[2:48:17] wackpoetic: no, use my opener NOW Madge
[2:48:35] dinkleminkle: not allowed Madge
[2:48:50] sober_toaster: damn that’s a rough lobby
[2:49:10] fridxa: Is Demon Hunter are good class guys?
[2:49:13] deepTTV: i was totally expecting you to 6-0 this @venruki
[2:49:16] fridxa: a good class
[2:49:39] setbackttv: For sure, im still learning SV myself and trying to live. I think i was playing too much like a warr
[2:49:46] setbackttv: didnt mean to backseat tilt you lol
[2:50:12] lordwizardmonk: you sound tilted
[2:50:18] sober_toaster: no spear to peel and root?
[2:50:23] deepTTV: LUL
[2:50:25] kultaporkkana: This is not to backseat i suck at hunter but u should take poison out of the bars LUL ur bombs apply the dot so u get more time to do other stuff
[2:50:26] Narrutv: Dont worry Venruki
[2:50:33] chimerablaque: GET 'EM VEN
[2:50:35] Jihnn: He just wants to help Sadge
[2:50:38] dinkleminkle: so ur fucking telling me blizzard saw DHs in their current state and ONLY slightly nerfed them
[2:50:41] Drockzoids: I think you're doing great
[2:50:46] asloff: surv is kinda like sub rogue, setup>burst>reset>repeat
[2:50:46] sober_toaster: surv is just rough atm into this meta so don’t get tilted
[2:51:02] Vanaxx: @dinkleminkle yup dh still will be god tier

[2:51:17] nikthevoker: does pet stil need to be on defensive to auto?
[2:51:21] kultaporkkana: Surv just need some games and he gets it
[2:51:21] Tpyoeror: dont get tilted over not being good at hunter
[2:51:23] asloff: the muscle memory isnt there yet
[2:51:29] TheAshkandi: sometimes you dont want to waste bomb on just a dot tho
[2:51:34] zachgamegodx: ppl take introspection as a invite to backseating, i learned not to do that overtime
[2:51:35] dinkleminkle: why are devs so scared to nerf DH I legit don’t get it
[2:51:45] setbackttv: SV has the most keybinds i've played out of any spec. I been having trouble finding good binds/space for it.
[2:51:45] buffnac: dh/ele/mw/pres ;might be one of the worst lobbies lmao
[2:51:59] buffnac: cant cc anything cant hurt anytthing
[2:52:20] TheAshkandi: they are worrried about pve nerfs, but if only they could nerf just dh in pvp...
[2:52:25] Zerikko: Think you might run some feral later on today?
[2:52:33] KyleStoney: tilt city?
[2:52:35] KyleStoney: xD
[2:52:38] greenflamingo117: Hunter is so bad right now
[2:52:44] Narrutv: Stop trolling guys
[2:52:46] nikthevoker: @venruki does pet being on defensive matter anymore?
[2:53:03] killer9298: im the same with fire mage at the moment
[2:53:05] dinkleminkle: @nikthevoker don’t think that matters lad
[2:53:14] killer9298: idk if its good or not atm but i enjoy it
[2:53:31] YEP_cawkk: lol doesn't appreciate advice
[2:53:32] sober_toaster: u got this big ven!
[2:53:35] boomkin_exploit: he is backseating backseatters into backseatting better
[2:53:41] setbackttv: I used to think mages were highest skill spec and after playing SV/SP with their binds and compexities mage is super ez in comparison
[2:53:42] nikthevoker: ok, thats what i was wondering it used to not auto
[2:53:45] ALLtheEXP: @YEP_cawkk not based
[2:53:53] asloff: i think you mean class*
[2:53:56] nimbus420i: Dh shits on everything
[2:54:09] buffnac: most melee shit on sv
[2:54:22] ZeroOmegaLul: I was wondering why my damage as ww monk was trash, then realized I wasn't actually wearing 4p tier... So I had to convert an item lmfao
[2:55:35] Bonquieshaa: i mean this lobby is OMEGALUL
[2:55:53] kultaporkkana: 2 dh on ur practise runs on dh KEKW
[2:55:54] R1_Prototype: I watched you play survival yesterday and went and respecced my hunter. it’s actually super fun. Favorite hunter spec and it feel like it has control the other specs don’t have
[2:55:56] z0vs: hey van 1.8xp surv hunter here let me give you some advice Kappa
[2:55:58] setbackttv: Does interlope work on the hunt?

[2:56:12] sober_toaster: welcome to my life as a surv hunter TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[2:56:13] konglarsen: I play healer and had a 4x DH lobby in solo shuffle last night.
[2:56:42] kultaporkkana: Sv is fine against mele its just hard to know when to run and go for dmg
[2:57:04] Cephqt: god, dh is so tilting to play against
[2:57:05] kultaporkkana: when dh can just spam dmg and stuns
[2:57:17] Reddbull2345: hard?
[2:57:22] Cephqt: DW, the nerfs will fix everything..... /s
[2:57:24] bpwryl: You’ve probably answered this a million times already, but do you plan to play cata classic?

[2:58:08] lordwizardmonk: take that one dudes advice Kappa
[2:58:08] FateIRL: its because you havent watched the bicmex guide
[2:58:11] Zerikko: looks like you're only playing survival until you become the new bicmex
[2:58:13] Tpyoeror: looks like my lobbies
[2:58:18] Reddbull2345: it takes alot to get used too ven.

[2:58:35] willie_stroker_99: Here we go
[2:58:39] R1_Prototype: all DH does is press eye beam, essence break and blade dance. you root them for 5 seconds and very 30 seconds snf their damage isn’t there.
[2:58:43] ItsBees: LUL 󠀀
[2:58:48] 5tarchild: 4.0.6 full stack mastery fury warrior one shotting people gonna be so fun

[2:58:59] Anubitetv: Play BM/Surv :D
[2:59:03] killer9298: i could care less for pve in cata
[2:59:10] Cephqt: you cant kite them too

[2:59:13] Cephqt: even on arcane
[2:59:22] Cephqt: even as arcane mage you cant shake them off
[2:59:24] sober_toaster: steel trap is nice into dh but lose big dmg
[2:59:28] morrs: Demo Lock is fun
[2:59:37] 5tarchild: ret paladin takes damage it just has bubble and thats it but at least it takes dmg
[2:59:40] grafe_: coming back to wow, you like spriest or destro lock better right now?
[2:59:41] 5tarchild: dh is just final boss
[2:59:50] kultaporkkana: @MaximumnNeo trinkets or all gear? why u got even pvp gear then
[2:59:50] Cephqt: there is no counter play vs DHs
[2:59:51] 4igv: are you gald in all the classes ?
[2:59:52] Cephqt: thats the issue
[3:00:02] Bonquieshaa: that lobby didnt count its ok ven :)
[3:00:08] morrs: Maybe Monks destroy DH right? :)
[3:00:18] asloff: is the pitlord build viable right now?
[3:00:18] Cephqt: is the destro nerf significant?
[3:00:21] brewtank: @venruki i wonder how the mage specs will feel after tuesday
[3:00:26] galadriel77: rogue druid and mage opinions on pvp cata ?
[3:01:02] kultaporkkana: @MaximumnNeo every website says 2 season is full pvp items
[3:01:15] ItsBees: Ven excited for maybe a new patch on tuesday Pog
[3:01:27] Cephqt: @venruki BM or Demo, which is easier to play?
[3:01:54] setbackttv: @venruki Is big tyrant still a thing with demo? I liked that playstyle alot
[3:01:56] jporter_: dont forget about your second felguard stun mr ruki
[3:01:57] xNotMat: It is
[3:01:58] Bigmoran: Long maintenance tuesday
[3:02:00] willie_stroker_99: It is
[3:02:02] Skillcap: it is
[3:02:03] ItsBees: 8 hours maintenance
[3:02:03] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[3:02:07] lordwizardmonk: literally said the 12th
[3:02:10] ItsBees: no real reason other than that
[3:02:12] Cephqt: chat is BM or Demo more difficult to play?
[3:02:12] miikedeez: thats bs, i'm in a 30min demo lock queue at the same rating
[3:02:16] Skillcap: WHAT
[3:02:17] ItsBees: look at your bnet launcher LUL
[3:02:18] greenflamingo117: They always say that it's 8hr.
[3:02:24] killer9298: whaaaat
[3:02:26] asloff: @Cephqt bro that's gotta be cap
[3:02:28] setbackttv: It felt really good to pull out big tyrant on opener and whoop cleaves
[3:02:28] maxdoesmath: @greenflamingo117 usually it says 1 hour
[3:02:35] eysn1: what patch ?
[3:02:37] greenflamingo117: Yes but they say 8
[3:02:39] asloff: @Cephqt real question?
[3:02:41] R1_Prototype: war within pre patch on beta maybe?
[3:02:50] Cephqt: @asloff ive never played either, they both seem like just send pets in
[3:02:52] xNotMat: why does no one actually read blue
[3:02:57] Cephqt: yeah real question
[3:03:09] kickinkcn: !updates
[3:03:10] asloff: @Cephqt bm rotation is the most braindead in the game.
[3:03:12] kickinkcn: !changes
[3:03:40] asloff: @Cephqt you literally just press your cd's and spam kill command and barbed shot
[3:03:58] Reddbull2345: @asloff but if u cant kite/cc as bm u get run down quick. Atleast Demo has some survivability.
[3:04:34] asloff: @Reddbull2345 yeah, but that's like hunter basics tbf
[3:04:59] xNotMat: Dk doing the entire lobbys dps combined
[3:05:19] setbackttv: @xNotMat hes also padding on 1000 demons
[3:05:23] xNotMat: yeah ik
[3:05:34] leeka: bfa islands with pirates

[3:21:10] R1_Prototype: maybe the classes and specs should be randomized on the wheel too
[3:21:13] lordwizardmonk: you should separate the classes on the wheel so its more random
[3:21:24] zachgamegodx: if feral cant clone soemone with grounding debuff they're so nerfed
[3:21:28] R1_Prototype: @lordwizardmonk lmao
[3:21:30] Robofat: mm rotation is pretty simple compared to sv
[3:21:34] StromicusRex: ven to himself: i wish they'd stop adding specs i dont play to the wheel
[3:21:37] zachgamegodx: or cant get the buff**
[3:21:50] BetterknownasJohn: love big bites
[3:21:55] fnxje_q: just play it then :D
[3:21:56] magebrainx: zachgamegodx i can't believe they did that to feral, as if the spec needs any sort of remote nerf in the current meta.
[3:22:05] magebrainx: even if it was an unintended interaction
[3:22:20] Pradathelord: eh i mean it was pretty bullshit
[3:22:26] Pradathelord: feral's problem is survivability

[3:29:20] driftwood_tc: Ever considered variety gaming?
[3:29:20] cleezyyy: Im a network engineer, I'm 10 years away from retirement so i plan on staying. Cant argue with retiring at 37

[3:30:08] yippey_: all about the pension life baby
[3:30:08] FateIRL: pension
[3:30:10] vjsnakefarm: idk 1 network engineer that retires at that age
[3:30:10] magebrainx: I worked with some orthopedic surgery residents who are finishing up their last year who plan to only practice for 10-12 years. So that would mean they trained for longer than they worked lol
[3:30:11] zachgamegodx: everyone wants to live above their means
[3:30:12] famous1939: just gotta load up that crypto
[3:30:12] chimerablaque: millions in the bank? why work
[3:30:15] juurrdd: honestly retiring at that age sounds terrible to me
[3:30:19] Reign_TV: retiring at 37 lmao is this Drake?
[3:30:24] MaximumnNeo: once you have a large enough asset level, it will provide you income indefinitely
[3:30:24] Magottx: Average retirement in my profession is like 25 lol
[3:30:29] yippey_: my pension is 88% of my highest 5 years averaged for the rest of my life

[3:30:49] eceria: @maxdoesmath lol
[3:30:53] chimerablaque: @yippey_ how did you get that in software?
[3:30:54] MaximumnNeo: 1 million would provide you roughly 60k a year with little risk if invested properly
[3:30:57] chimerablaque: @yippey_
[3:31:03] FateIRL: if you were making asmon money no reason to quit just keep doing it forever
[3:31:03] PlangFromWoW: if you retired do you think you would stop streaming?
[3:31:15] willie_stroker_99: I don't think we get to retire, ww3 is on the rise
[3:31:20] Msv2: Once you get rich, its all about status
[3:31:26] Msv2: Peer status
[3:31:28] yippey_: @chimerablaque Im a firefighter, I get my pension through the city, Plus my military retirement
[3:31:29] addiiez: is $60k a decent wage in canada now?
[3:31:29] chimerablaque: if you own your home and dont pay rent 50k is fine
[3:31:34] xNotMat: Be grateful you guys live in a supreme 1st world
[3:31:35] MaximumnNeo: yeah thats 4%, so hopefully your investment is growing more than 4%
[3:31:39] zachgamegodx: canadians never retire as their dollar deflates every year
[3:31:46] theodeth: 60k covers my rent and utilities
[3:31:46] MaximumnNeo: there are products out their designed to do exactly what you are suggesting tho
[3:31:46] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: If u have a million ur house should be paid off so the 60k is just food and utilities
[3:31:47] Najbro: i make a well over 100k and i can barely afford to subscribe
[3:31:49] Msv2: 60k is min wage today
[3:32:02] TheLantern: Bruh, i work with executives who are Millionaires and they are working into there 60s-70s. Some people are obsessed with working out
[3:32:08] Magottx: The guy I train with signed a 4 year 60 mil then a 2 year 20 mil last year so he’s prob done after this year 30 years old

[3:32:12] xNotMat: @MaximumnNeo Literally the S&P500 is +-15% p/a for the last 20 years
[3:32:15] addiiez: that's absurd
[3:32:23] BlueMagikTed: it also depends where you live
[3:32:24] zachgamegodx: how much an a new iphone in canadian dollars
[3:32:27] addiiez: that's like £500 here
[3:32:27] MaximumnNeo: yeah, i wouldnt suggest just doing the SP 500 alone, but you have the right idea
[3:32:39] boomkin_exploit: 1USD ~ 1.33CAD
[3:32:41] Skillcap: any chance thug cleave coming back with the hunter buffs?

[3:33:15] plebcake_: inflation isn’t better here in Europe either. it’s a global issue, especially housing market affordability
[3:33:16] Msv2: The Euro is just a union of like 600 million people or some shit
[3:33:16] zachgamegodx: its not 1:1 but idk i feel like the wages are similar
[3:33:17] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: Want to see something crazy google US National Debt Clock
[3:33:28] StromicusRex: hmm
[3:33:34] chimerablaque: @yippey_ ahhh yeah that makes sense. I have a buddy that did something similar and retired at 35
[3:33:57] Skillcap: oh boi
[3:33:57] chimerablaque: @yippey_ He unretired at 45 though cuz he was bored and wanted money
[3:34:00] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: Looking at Rome
[3:34:01] magebrainx: national debt isnt real Kappa
[3:34:05] driftwood_tc: Corpa
[3:34:06] magebrainx: its just numbers
[3:34:07] Adessius: that's doable
[3:34:09] zachgamegodx: @BigDamJudgeGitFukd us can h ave inifnite amount of debt bc we 1v9'd in ww2
[3:34:14] setbackttv: dang -28 on my sv hunter shuff, feral 6-0 angle
[3:34:16] TheLantern: those numbers mean nothing to me
[3:34:21] Skillcap: this debt going wild upwards
[3:34:23] StromicusRex: i gagged seeing that debt
[3:34:23] setbackttv: he was a master of cyclone ferocious bite executing
[3:34:35] xNotMat: its a lot of embedded gifs
[3:34:42] chimerablaque: Need this graphic for canada
[3:34:44] zachgamegodx: the debt doesnt matter at all
[3:34:45] TheLantern: yeah it is fake
[3:34:46] Cocoapuffs1: its all fake lmao
[3:34:48] chimerablaque: whats fake about it
[3:34:48] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: US debt will reach 50 trillion in the next 10 years
[3:34:49] setbackttv: I think imma be hardstuck SV 2100 for another 500 games until i git gud
[3:34:49] magebrainx: it will never be paid out
[3:34:51] Cocoapuffs1: unemployed doesnt move
[3:34:52] Robofat: random generator
[3:34:59] Msv2: The big numbers are national debt
[3:35:02] Skillcap: debt that never will be payed so... its whatever, no?
[3:35:02] chimerablaque: It's definitely relevant
[3:35:20] konglarsen: Debt = money & money = debt
[3:35:25] mrmsix6: it does matter, debt service continues to rise and eat up a larger portion of spending, people saying its fake or doesnt matter are coping
[3:35:28] willie_stroker_99: You are 100% right on that
[3:35:32] setbackttv: I wish i bought bitcoin in 2006
[3:35:32] xNotMat: BitCoin is THE ULTIMATE PONZI scheme
[3:35:32] chimerablaque: easy way to think of it is more debt, less services for the tax revenue
[3:35:34] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: People think it doesnt matter because 10 trillion 20 trillion was sustainable but its getting so high that it wont be sustainable
[3:35:38] zachgamegodx: @chimerablaque personal debt is, countries debt to other countries doesnt matter
[3:35:41] xNotMat: the Demon Hunter of SCAMS
[3:35:54] MaximumnNeo: at some point the debt will get so high they wont be able to service their payments
[3:35:56] setbackttv: Everyone was talking about it back then, imagine if you bought like $1,000 of bitcoin in early 2000s and sat on it
[3:36:00] magebrainx: compound interest but not the good kind LOL
[3:36:02] MaximumnNeo: if they default the global financial system crumbles
[3:36:04] Msv2: US has the strongest reality of getting paid back for buying bonds etc as well as a great wealth of them to buy, so everyone buys US debt
[3:36:07] zachgamegodx: nothing can happen, it's all about relations brother, that money will never be payed

[3:36:13] TheLantern: when you are the world super power does it even matter lol
[3:36:22] Kurzie: they print more money, inflation goes through the roof and a loaf of bread costs 20 bucks
[3:36:27] FateIRL: you can literally print money
[3:36:28] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: Yeah but then the debt goes higher and then they owe more and more until they go bust
[3:36:30] willie_stroker_99: The problem is that they print money
[3:36:35] MaximumnNeo: thats exactly what the US has done in the past. But at some point you print so much you just devalue your currency
[3:36:37] boomkin_exploit: has a top 10 economy ever defaulted on its debt?
[3:36:38] chimerablaque: @zachgamegodx country debt is definitely relevant. It contributes to the value of your currency.
[3:36:43] Msv2: They prob just print more money yeah lol
[3:36:45] magebrainx: right what if we just say no we arent going to pay? what military power is going to hold us accountable? im here for ww3
[3:36:47] Magottx: Isn’t like 2/3 of that money we used for ourselves tho. So it literally means nothing
[3:36:47] a_bu: Squirrel  skin trade back
[3:36:50] Msv2: If you have 36 trill in debt
[3:36:52] leeka: onlyfans
[3:36:52] chimerablaque: @zachgamegodx As the debt rises, the dollar is less useful
[3:36:53] willie_stroker_99: They don't
[3:36:56] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: It will get so high they wont be able to
[3:36:59] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: one day
[3:36:59] Dawudz: a lot of economiste here
[3:37:02] xNotMat: As long as humans exist, nothing will work tbh. They always take and take and fuck it all up.
[3:37:09] willie_stroker_99: Inflation is the word
[3:37:14] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: and then u will see financial mayhem like no other
[3:37:16] setbackttv: Atleast US housing hasnt hit canda levels yet
[3:37:18] MaximumnNeo: Actually the US has a smoking gun they can implement to just fix it
[3:37:21] setbackttv: were heading that way tho
[3:37:26] 2pikula: us-ai-onlyfans
[3:37:26] MaximumnNeo: its just politically unpopular
[3:37:30] Magottx: Nuke whoever we owe Murica
[3:37:31] MaximumnNeo: Its called GST
[3:37:36] chimerablaque: Canada's debt is worse under Trudeau
[3:37:38] Msv2: You inflate the money and its easier to pay it lol 1 dollar inflates to 2 to 5 so its like paying half of what was actually borrowed
[3:37:49] FateIRL: bring back stephen harper
[3:37:55] chimerablaque: Canadian healthcare is abysmal
[3:38:00] willie_stroker_99: US is living on fumes right now
[3:38:07] setbackttv: I think generationally it was better no matter the country. You could get a house with a summer job and handshake with local bank manager
[3:38:08] xNotMat: Ven help me immigrate to Canada? I'll mow your lawn.
[3:38:09] setbackttv: We got screwed
[3:38:10] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: The federal reserve said our current debt path is unsustainable yet Biden just spent half a trillion in one day
[3:38:20] FateIRL: its crazy how worse canada got since trudeau took over lol
[3:38:20] Raaein: pretty much every western country has a 100+% debt to gdp ratio, it doesn't really mean anything
[3:38:31] magebrainx: US healthcare is worldclass but the insurance situation is the worst thing in the world. It's such a scam.
[3:38:33] 2pikula: mac miller time?
[3:38:43] mrmsix6: i enjoy some harsh vocals, but it gets tiring after a while
[3:38:43] lordwizardmonk: because biden is a senile tard
[3:38:46] chimerablaque: @Raaein I would suggest you do more research. Because what you're saying is not true.
[3:38:50] inflamesrocks: KEKVibe
[3:38:55] Msv2: Canada is rich in resources and land, just cold weather holding you guys down
[3:38:58] ItsBees: Double D's Pog
[3:39:04] MaximumnNeo: if the US impletemented GST, they would print a trillion dollars a year in tax revenue, and they could pay down their debt with basically no issue. But super unpopular
[3:39:06] leeka: yup
[3:39:06] ekologiisk: 1
[3:39:07] Mstr_Grimm: it definitely will be lol
[3:39:08] ItsBees: me :)
[3:39:11] FateIRL: yep
[3:39:14] setbackttv: How was canada in the 50's and 60s? was a house still 2.1x the median income like US?
[3:39:16] plebcake_: BUT the 2% HP nerf!!!!!
[3:39:26] Zenfuzz: i wish they wouldnt buff fire the way they are. Just give them a little extra defense
[3:39:26] setbackttv: it used to be 2.1 median income for a house now its like 7x
[3:39:26] gamem0re: ryan reynolds pog
[3:39:27] spirantsix: Lol no its the dude running the place into the ground
[3:39:31] setbackttv: its insane
[3:39:32] a_bu: Is solo que good way to gain pve power
[3:39:33] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: @MaximumnNeo And then their bill goes higher next year
[3:39:41] magebrainx: make sparks account wide please
[3:39:43] Cocoapuffs1: their dam will still be high after nerf
[3:39:44] magebrainx: thank you in advance
[3:39:46] randydangerx: I'm an mglad war main. I swapped DH and got glad in 3 weeks. It's so damn strong
[3:40:00] Msv2: Ofc thats just my personal opinion hehehe
[3:40:28] setbackttv: Well when you think about our parents/grand parents gen, money just went way further too. Now you go to grocery store get 5 things and get sticker shock. Inflation FTL
[3:41:07] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: Thats inflation.. and the more they spend the more of a "tax" ordinary people feel. This drives down tax revenue and accelerates the financial problems. @setbackttv
[3:41:25] bigpumperrz: Dont be negative
[3:41:25] cleezyyy: I love how chat turned into the world economic forum XD
[3:41:27] bigpumperrz: 6-0 win
[3:41:41] plebcake_: not the alpha chad energy u NEED
[3:41:51] Msv2: Very tough
[3:41:57] ginyu_music: i feel like devokers shit out damage
[3:42:06] ginyu_music: its kinda nuts
[3:42:12] chimerablaque: @setbackttv and that's because the country took out loans in the name of future generations (namely us)
[3:42:13] MaximumnNeo: @BigDamJudgeGitFukd paying down national debt is not an inflation driver. If they used it on the economy or federal spending yes. Tax increase reduce inflation as people spend less
[3:42:43] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: @MaximumnNeo When one prints one also increases debt
[3:42:47] chimerablaque: @setbackttv if you get a credit card and you run it to the max, life is great.  Then you have to pay it back with interest. And you realize it's not so great.
[3:42:58] MaximumnNeo: a new GST would not be printing money
[3:43:09] MaximumnNeo: it would be pulling existing
[3:43:13] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: This is exactly why we are heading to 50 trillion debt lol that exact logic u have
[3:43:15] setbackttv: @chimerablaque them 30% interest rates add up fast. Credit cards scare me
[3:43:17] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: "just print"
[3:43:53] chimerablaque: @setbackttv yep. And it works the same for countries.
[3:43:57] bigpumperrz: ez game
[3:44:01] Vigi9413: isn’t disintegrate like 80% of dev damage or something nutty like that
[3:44:08] gorefangx: @venruki do you think enhancement shaman is good atm?
[3:44:22] leeka: totems too
[3:44:24] Cocoapuffs1: and grounding
[3:44:24] Voriq: Probably too tunnel vision and dont even see it
[3:44:25] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: Its up in the air and all we know how to do is attack the go target
[3:44:25] Drockzoids: Doesn't it fly way up in the air now?
[3:44:27] chimerablaque: @MaximumnNeo if you have more of something, it's less rare and therefore less valuable. Printing more money just devalues your existing currency
[3:44:28] Msv2: As a melee I can't hit the observer
[3:44:29] jporter_: a dingleberry
[3:44:32] zlovett08: psyfiend, observ, grounding an tremor.
[3:44:33] willie_stroker_99: Alright, gotcha
[3:44:34] zlovett08: bunch of shit
[3:44:39] Msv2: It ranges me
[3:44:40] Drockzoids: It flies up in the air, right?
[3:44:40] Msv2: D:
[3:44:41] bigpumperrz: hes up, how to though
[3:44:42] dmgcurry: thats right brother
[3:44:44] Hobblefoot: Dude... Language.  Dingus.  I mean come on, Crusader, chill
[3:44:59] MaximumnNeo: @chimerablaque i know that, but GST isnt printing money, which you seemed to fundamentally misunderstand
[3:44:59] Msv2: We def kill groundings
[3:45:11] MaximumnNeo: removing money from the economy is a priomary inflation deflator
[3:45:14] MaximumnNeo: its called fiscal policy
[3:45:34] xNotMat: We should stop talking about the worlds economy
[3:45:35] chimerablaque: @MaximumnNeo The money isn't removed from the economy, it's reallocated
[3:45:44] chimerablaque: @MaximumnNeo it's not burned like crypto
[3:45:57] Vigi9413: dev looks fun tbh
[3:46:11] Msv2: Massivestone
[3:46:25] chimerablaque: @maxdoesmath the GST also creates an inefficiency in that it costs some money to collect it.  So you create waste in the economy. See broken window fallacy
[3:46:56] xNotMat: That cinematic fly by
[3:47:08] deepTTV: oh wow another double dh lobby cool
[3:47:12] nimbus420i: double DH lobbies kekW

[3:47:19] deepTTV: you think dhs are good right now?
[3:47:21] Vigi9413: all the dh’s coming out while they can
[3:47:25] jporter_: lol that spec can just tank a dev evoker
[3:47:29] dreambear__: LOL
[3:47:50] Msv2: :D
[3:48:04] BigDamJudgeGitFukd: Straightens business tie, polishes shining black shoes, excuse me fellow financier but if they keep spending money then more attention towards Bitcoin will grow. This is the entire basis behind Bitcoin is the dollar is becoming useless from reckless monetary policies thus attracting institutional investors. @chimerablaque
[3:48:25] Msv2: Insaneeeeeeeee
[3:48:26] notedibles: from this taco
[3:49:45] chimerablaque: @BigDamJudgeGitFukd The price of Bitcoin is multifactorial, but yes the dollar's price has an inverse relationship to the price of bitcoin.
[3:49:54] Pradathelord: gg you were ranging that bad boy
[3:50:24] cleezyyy: Beautiful
[3:50:26] Vigi9413: he did not want to go on that ride

[3:52:58] steez0tv: lol blueblurblur
[3:53:28] chimerablaque: I actually cry when I see the price of bitcoin because I had the option to buy it when it was $500 and didn't.  Should have had faith.
[3:54:02] xNotMat: insane comeback
[3:54:05] dreambear__: Insane

[4:27:44] magebrainx: Demon hunters are not easy to play. You have to admit it takes a certain level of skill to excel on a DH in solo shuffle. moreso than specs like mage and hunter at least
[4:27:51] Dusa17: okay then frost it will be

[4:51:10] cyborg1141: Ret could 100 to zero you in a 8 second strangulate
[4:51:14] Sheepyou: in warth i had the axe from Kelthuzad with my ret .. jesus i was so freaking OP
[4:51:14] Robofat: 4 rets lobbies
[4:51:16] cyborg1141: With a dk
[4:51:19] Sheepyou: wrath*
[4:51:28] Pradathelord: @privx rukiBuddy
[4:52:07] Robofat: @Sheepyou I had double axe on fury and sucked anyway
[4:52:15] nikthevoker: no more 3 DH lobbys now
[4:52:23] TheCasualDad84: Choo Chooo LuvPeekR
[4:52:39] R1_Prototype: they will be killable tho. maybe
[4:52:40] cyborg1141: Only 2 dh lobbies
[4:52:44] ferahgok: @nikthevoker it's only going to be 2 DH lobbies instead
[4:52:55] Holtan3111: What stats do i go for as Augmentation ?
[4:52:56] nikthevoker: ill still take 2 over 3
[4:52:59] Magottx: So rets have been omega broken 3 times
[4:53:03] repsac1442: that’s how 2s are now either double dps hybrid or healer hybrid/dh I would go as far to say dh is basically a hybrid with all there leech
[4:53:08] zerx_gg: poor guy
[4:53:09] R1_Prototype: lmao
[4:53:22] magebrainx: I'm a fan of how they chose to nerf DH this coming week only if they continue to adjust those numbers as needed like next week for example, frequently
[4:53:22] zerx_gg: i think warlocks need a big boy nerf too
[4:53:24] NAT0_141: dragonflight world PvP?? aww yeah
[4:53:25] Vautry: he just left LOL
[4:53:40] willie_stroker_99: Wow I have followers
[4:53:41] What_ln_Tarnation: DH gonna take 3% more dam from all sources and have 2% less hp, theyll be OK
[4:53:49] R1_Prototype: ahahaha. he used the 10 second cds as he flew off the edge
[4:53:54] TheCasualDad84: it is
[4:53:56] Deitox: agree
[4:53:56] rainmannxz: DF is amazing I completely agree
[4:53:57] repsac1442: I’m still happy with dragon flying
[4:53:58] Holtan3111: Agree
[4:53:58] nvees: yeah
[4:53:59] privx: df will get mop treatment, eventually remembered as great
[4:53:59] Pradathelord: dflight has been pretty good
[4:53:59] 5tarchild: expansion is good except for DH
[4:54:02] cyborg1141: Yeah
[4:54:04] Pradathelord: minus ret paladins
[4:54:05] TheCasualDad84: just wish SS didnt take so long
[4:54:07] xdarkbaconx: relative to wow itself ya, but i wish wow had a quicker update pattern
[4:54:07] zerx_gg: yo ven fix your vips
[4:54:08] Hobblefoot: Warlocks don't feel like they need a nerf when they run into all melee lobbies.
[4:54:10] Robofat: bad lore but who cares but good in general
[4:54:12] 5tarchild: nerf DH and its perfect
[4:54:20] Magottx: I agree
[4:54:25] RobbieFire: Can't wait for SoD Dragonflight
[4:54:27] cyborg1141: Way better than the last one I think the game world outside of the xpax is empty
[4:54:31] ekologiisk: its been really good, some balancing issues but other then that, its been good
[4:54:37] R1_Prototype: dragon riding is fine. but couldn't you have just increased flight speed too? my .02
[4:54:42] PineTreesz: @5tarchild you get your wish on the 12th.
[4:54:46] kaznab: the war within is gonna be the worst expansion in wow’s history. Literally zero impactful features
[4:54:49] Magottx: One of few expansions I haven’t really got bored of. Mostly cause shuff
[4:54:54] magebrainx: I like the zones very much
[4:54:55] nnumbing: the dragonriding thing for groundmounts would be fun
[4:54:59] magebrainx: and the  soup
[4:55:04] zerx_gg: the only thing i dont like about dragonriding is not being able to fly static in the air
[4:55:04] NAT0_141: @kaznab gotta be better than Draenor
[4:55:07] zerx_gg: ya know, just hang
[4:55:07] Pradathelord: i like dragon riding all over i just want it for all mounts for fun now
[4:55:09] nameyourform: rip druid flight form
[4:55:10] Holtan3111: Hi @venruki i am currently gearing my Augmentationt Evoker. Trying it for the first time. WHat stats do i go for ? do i go 4 set ?
[4:55:14] animity: is dragonriding in azeroth yet or no
[4:55:16] animity: or like
[4:55:17] chrihorp: dragonriding is best thing they ever implemented
[4:55:19] animity: the regular azeroth
[4:55:20] PineTreesz: @animity ye
[4:55:22] zerx_gg: ye animity
[4:55:33] animity: pog tbh
[4:55:38] Magottx: I do but there’s just no need for the charges of flaps
[4:55:39] TheCasualDad84: what do you put in for the "Infuse with Power" when getting a piece crafted?
[4:55:50] kaznab: @nat0_141 I think it’ll be close
[4:55:55] nameyourform: u a rank 1 dragon rider
[4:56:00] R1_Prototype: but sometimes I want getting somewhere to require NO interaction with the environment tho. lots of places to go in wow
[4:56:06] Robofat: what mmr on Aug?
[4:56:11] morrs: I absolutely agree about the dragonriding. I started playing Dragondlight bcz of your stream and I absolutely love the game - mechanics and design. I like the class complexity and the rotations, cds etc
[4:56:20] magebrainx: Magottx in pvp mid air you can catch opponents by using your charges better.
[4:56:22] zerx_gg: dune 2 was great
[4:56:25] animity: you dont wanna line up next to me on the dragon races though
[4:56:34] galdinator: @R1_Prototype flight paths existed since vanilla
[4:56:35] NAT0_141: @kaznab I’m with you, just hoping we’re wrong lol. in the meantime I’ll focus WolTK and Cata lol
[4:56:42] kaznab: TWW is also underground which is usually boring. It has nothing going for it. Would be a massive surprise if they pull it off
[4:56:50] Sheepyou: @zerx_gg how is Dune the first one ?didnt saw even the first part
[4:56:54] Gigglez21: classic
[4:56:57] Gigglez21: zzz
[4:56:58] zerx_gg: also very good
[4:57:05] zerx_gg: cant wait for part 3
[4:57:08] cyborg1141: I don't have to play 80 raids to get a trinket to heal
[4:57:09] americanmoses18: dune 2 is a top 5 movie easily
[4:57:24] Vautry: adequately hyped, movie was fucking insane
[4:57:29] animity: such a good adaptation is what pogs me
[4:57:30] kaznab: yea hope I’m wrong too but feels like a filler expansion before they actually do cool stuff with the other two (hopefully)
[4:57:31] NAT0_141: dune 2 crushed it. the visuals and sound are fantastic
[4:57:32] 5tarchild: first few expansions were not balanced at all idk why people are tripping, its just nostalgia i think
[4:57:34] animity: i loooove dune series
[4:57:34] zerx_gg: Very orange
[4:57:35] americanmoses18: score, visuals, acting all 10/10
[4:57:38] xdarkbaconx: i really disliked the first dune so im hesitant
[4:57:45] animity: can i try to help ven
[4:57:48] animity: as a massive nred
[4:57:49] hunchurio: such as?
[4:57:49] driftwood_tc: Which is the best Scifi movie ever made then in your opinion?
[4:57:50] timefornow: The Dune books are insane
[4:57:50] animity: nerd
[4:57:54] cyborg1141: -1 for sandwalking
[4:57:55] Bigmoran: I really liked the movie but i felt like it jumped around like crazy
[4:57:58] animity: cause the story is pogged
[4:57:59] MorwGli: !song

[4:58:03] animity: oh true
[4:58:05] zerx_gg: spoil is perm banned
[4:58:07] Sheepyou: do i have to watch the first Dune or can i watch dune 2
[4:58:14] animity: @Sheepyou watch first one dude
[4:58:15] zerx_gg: id def watch the first
[4:58:15] Trelix: Dune books is something what must all read...Insane
[4:58:16] NAT0_141: the Dune mini series from 2002 is also fantastic
[4:58:16] animity: obviously
[4:58:30] Sheepyou: thx guys
[4:58:49] hunchurio: what do u think of the class changes? @venruki
[4:58:50] zerx_gg: close your ears if you havent seen it yet!!
[4:58:53] animity: when they walk into the monochrome lighting
[4:58:54] animity: pogggg
[4:58:55] Synkz_00: This queue is taking forever
[4:59:13] Vautry: Austin Butler's Fed was so sick
[4:59:16] PineTreesz: did aug get buffed or something?
[4:59:18] spacemanwx: now thats CAP
[4:59:18] Vautry: totally menacing
[4:59:22] Vautry: Feyd*
[4:59:23] repsac1442: really I never see Aug
[4:59:32] Synkz_00: Need to nerf them so there aren't as many people playing them
[4:59:34] zerx_gg: awc finals pulled almost double viewership of mdi finals pogg
[4:59:51] animity: all the PvE watchers r watching co-streams tho
[4:59:56] animity: is factual
[5:00:03] galifax2: tbh the mdi can be more predictable
[5:00:09] galifax2: both the gameplay and who wins
[5:00:20] zerx_gg: probably
[5:00:23] Pradathelord: i find the mdi a bit less interesting but im glad ppl like shit
[5:00:26] galifax2: same pulls mostly, same classes and specs, same dungeons
[5:00:26] magebrainx: mdi is unwatchable for me personally. i dont get the excitement
[5:00:34] mrmsix6: MDI is so sleeper
[5:00:35] Sheepyou: @magebrainx same
[5:00:37] Synkz_00: MDI isn't that entertaining to watch. I've done only pve most of this expansion and would rather watch AWC
[5:00:38] zerx_gg: its pretty nice to have 3 different "esports" for wow
[5:00:46] leeka: add pvp
[5:00:48] zerx_gg: ban certain specs
[5:01:01] magebrainx: put affixes or weird shit in dungeons never seen on live relams
[5:01:14] zerx_gg: just start with like 2 spec bans
[5:01:17] zerx_gg: could be really nice
[5:01:27] PineTreesz: banning specs just seems like a cope out for poor balancing...
[5:01:30] zerx_gg: force people to multiclass
[5:01:33] zerx_gg: its so easy now anyway
[5:01:34] magebrainx: or make like bonus objectives in dungeons that they arent made aware of until the key starts
[5:01:43] healhut: spec bans would have a weird effect on the meta imo
[5:01:43] nikthevoker: whats your highest mmr on dragon?
[5:01:46] Pradathelord: @magebrainx this would be cool
[5:01:46] mrmsix6: running new dungeons that no one has ever seen before or practiced for a hundreds of runs would be fun
[5:01:57] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy exendem WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[5:02:01] zerx_gg: or mix up the boss order
[5:02:10] Pradathelord: there's something to be said about what they find out and practice and stuff
[5:02:12] zerx_gg: idk im yappin
[5:02:21] magebrainx: as it is now as just a time trial in a 100% solved well known dungeon its just so predictable and honestly kinda boring. they need to spice it up and surprise the competitors
[5:02:33] zerx_gg: two bosses at the same time pog
[5:02:39] Pradathelord: its like if they were playing pro monopoly
[5:02:40] exendem: exendem subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey man I usually don't say a lot, but just wanted to let you know that I enjoy your streams a lot! Thanks for that! :)
[5:02:47] animity: the pog content is watching a team be obviously insanely better like echo going 10-0 or whatever they do

[5:03:55] Pradathelord: i just find it uninteresting
[5:04:24] Pradathelord: they did make a cool format though for sure, like its cool how they have even adapted it since its inception
[5:04:24] bigmacdiddydaddy: be kinda a long back and forth given each dungeon takes 20 min lol
[5:04:34] FlyFYI: they should make it a key race, start them at key 0 and see who can get the highest key done the fatest
[5:04:56] edenwow__: Hey ven, how is aug in arena atm? 2v2/solo? I main pve but want to do some arena for fun and wondered if aug is worth it
[5:05:11] suhnu: just need any kind of suprise element
[5:05:18] bigmacdiddydaddy: generally taking keys to higher lvls makes it moer stale cuz ppl just run tanky comps and do smaller pulls
[5:05:27] galdinator: i have a feeling pve players dont like going off script
[5:05:41] zerx_gg: lol i found them @venruki

[5:13:44] morrs: @AN771ok It is hard. The game demands you to know what each class spec does and good reaction times. That is my opinion. If you are stepping in WoW for the first time I advice you first to play different classes and see what you like + learn what each one does
