[3:04:22] 1neff4ble: Wassup, Tommy and chat? Hope your health gets better!
[3:04:24] CircleSocialClub: Btw stocks and real estate are generally considered passive incomes... so when someone says its hard work, they lying, or only talking about the initial work, over time its passive.

[3:05:22] TheBjornen: This our future tank ; )
[3:05:30] 1neff4ble: @CircleSocialClub if you are a day trader, it's hard work, no? I have no experience as a day trader but from my experience in trading it seems stressful
[3:05:46] scottish1900: Arumba is just a master of EU4, same with Florry. Both can take situations that are complete disasters and turn them into golden countries
[3:05:46] H4Hollow: H4Hollow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 2 years tommykLOVE
[3:05:50] CircleSocialClub: @CircleSocialClub dayb trading for sure. But i long term investment is passive
[3:05:57] scottish1900: Though the methods they use are both radically different LUL
[3:06:10] robertrbsn: @1neff4ble daytrading is loosing money for most people
[3:07:33] 1neff4ble: @robertrbsn I'm not sure. I feel like people that have experience might make money but most people that are just starting like me aren't experience so they throw their money away, which is why the bigget 100% of day traders might lose money. But if you have couple years in the field I don't see why not make money daily
[3:07:43] The_Yazoo: unless Bence is in the group, then you need masterlooter
[3:08:03] scottish1900: Honestly, when I hit trouble I just try to develop out of it, or find a way to get more gold, but that's SP so no help for MP
[3:08:08] The_Yazoo: He still hasn't apologized to Wolfpoops

[3:08:14] TheBjornen: I think
[3:08:20] The_Yazoo: @TheBjornen ye
[3:08:37] CircleSocialClub: I consider most daytrading gamba, except if you do really deep analysis and spread exposure (like the actual professionals) or have insider info. One provides a very small edge the other a big one.  Its hard to beat the marked daytrading in my xp

[3:50:40] Aristidebancevu: pepoG
[3:50:45] Hyperage2003: what, nahh that is a good game
[3:50:46] Vegasmcswagger: I stumbled upno a clip where he talks to a girl about how big his balls are
[3:50:51] thomas_letrain: I'm 31 and I had the realisation that my balls were getting saggy
[3:50:52] TR3Nzee: ok almost got me
[3:50:58] Vegasmcswagger: and she says i know your balls

[3:51:32] Rullvardt: true tho
[3:51:33] lafureur1: Trying too hard to bait us Kappa
[3:51:34] thomas_letrain: it's story driven
[3:51:38] Bence9811: yeah, that's true
[3:51:43] Vegasmcswagger: there normie enjoyers sure but there's high level enjoyers
[3:51:45] kikzou: u spam dodge too

[3:51:53] T1_Draven: If you want storry driven game play bg3 lol
[3:51:58] TR3Nzee: dlc is a skill check
[3:52:00] Bence9811: true
[3:52:00] bruxseles: Once a year you forget a bunch of stuff
[3:52:01] CircleSocialClub: I would say the same about cyberpunk
[3:52:06] accypyter: some people just want to game and chill
[3:52:08] Rullvardt: choices ACTUALLY matter in witcher 3
[3:52:15] thomas_letrain: I didn't played it twice, but it's a great game still
[3:52:15] Hyperage2003: @T1_Draven now that is a good game
[3:52:19] mighty_samurai: Storys alternate a lot these days.
[3:52:20] RutgerVerhox: That's why I played SWTOR, there's so much story content int here.
[3:52:21] Vegasmcswagger: Doubt
[3:52:28] TR3Nzee: depends on your aim
[3:52:29] T1_Draven: actually thinking about it, anyone claiming to like storry driven games without having played Planescape Torment is a poser imo
[3:52:29] Bence9811: also cyberpunk can be played a lot of different ways
[3:52:30] realcoachburger: U played retail at all tommy?
[3:52:32] thomas_letrain: you're too ADHD
[3:52:43] Hyperage2003: I feel like witcher games might be more fun if you read the books
[3:52:44] Doszpi: @TommyKayLIVE Maybe they don't play it for the story? You play WoW millions of times, no story involved.
[3:52:50] realcoachburger: veryyyy gooood
[3:52:56] bruxseles: Well maybe Red dead Redemption after all KEKW
[3:53:03] Vegasmcswagger: its all about eleveling up enough ebfore going against a hard boss
[3:53:05] realcoachburger: tommy, you know witcher 3 is story based?
[3:53:15] Vegasmcswagger: in both games
[3:53:16] Soviet_Steel49: wow is mega boring
[3:53:19] Bence9811: i wouldn't say boring, but true, it's not that hard
[3:53:29] djorn127: NG+ on Death March is quite hard, I think you would find it enjoyable
[3:53:34] DynastyLowBrain: you gonna try retail again ?
[3:53:37] TR3Nzee: gameplay is good enough for one playthrough but after few more it gets stale
[3:53:54] Bence9811: nah, i played out witcher with the basic armor
[3:54:02] thomas_letrain: The gameplay is not great today, but the game is 9 years old almost
[3:54:02] Vegasmcswagger: @djorn127 normal new game is harder on death march, ng+ you start with your previous stuff so its an easier start
[3:54:04] bruxseles: I mean Assasin isnt hard either but people enjoy it
[3:54:05] Obi_Juan_Chromosome: I mean skyrim ain't a hard game either but it's still considered goat
[3:54:10] kikzou: play metro exodus ultra hard tommy u will love it
[3:54:11] PabloTescobar26: People replay the witcher for the same reason people replay skyrim
[3:54:30] agans_liv_live: @TommyKayLIVE tommy can you explain WOW to me like what is the point of the game
[3:54:31] thomas_letrain: At the time it was pretty good
[3:54:32] wakopeenhughmungs: @kikzou metro is amazing
[3:54:43] T1_Draven: I love this out of pocket roasting from tommy from time to time
[3:54:44] Bence9811: did you play mass effect?
[3:54:47] djorn127: @Vegasmcswagger yeah but the gap becomes wider because the stuff you bring along gets outdated quite quick
[3:54:48] DynastyLowBrain: they improved retail alot gearing isnt that hard anymore and its more alt friendly D:
[3:54:52] kikzou: @wakopeenhughmungs thaank u mate, someone with greeat taste here
[3:54:53] Auric_G: Auric_G subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[3:55:01] thomas_letrain: Is the baby sick too?
[3:55:01] Hyperage2003: I get that witcher might not be good game play wise but when it comes to actuall story it's really in depth when you play from the first witcher game till the third one. And their even making a fourth one
[3:55:12] Bence9811: @thomas_letrain he was
[3:55:26] Vegasmcswagger: @djorn127 its felt like a cakewalk for me tbh
[3:55:31] PabloTescobar26: @Hyperage2003 you've also got all the backstory from the books if you're into it
[3:55:35] thomas_letrain: @Bence9811 poor little thing
[3:55:35] Bence9811: @thomas_letrain could be still
[3:55:48] djorn127: got 50+ people watching when the Witcher 3 discussion started
[3:55:53] Rykkert: tommy the troll :tf:

[3:56:15] T1_Draven: no jarjar binks impressions please
[3:56:18] TheBjornen: Comes in the mail right
[3:56:22] TheBjornen: Or is it on the corpse
[3:56:25] djorn127: @Vegasmcswagger I guess you're still right if you compare it to the competition, even without Quen.
[3:56:28] Hyperage2003: @PabloTescobar26 yeah, exactly, if you take the time to read the books and then play the games. For me atleast it was like playing a whole different game
[3:56:31] T1_Draven: @RutgerVerhox if you cannot handle allchat roasing in dota gtfo and go to league
[3:56:48] Bence9811: toxic Tommy
[3:56:53] Rykkert: im totally not a bot
[3:56:54] RutgerVerhox: @T1_Draven Who says I can't
[3:56:55] Soviet_Steel49: tommy tate
[3:56:56] Obi_Juan_Chromosome: Says the all year long sick guy
[3:57:05] Vegasmcswagger: @djorn127 i got in with the best gear i didnt mention that, like aerondight wich levels while you level up
[3:57:09] CircleSocialClub: The other guy prob things he is right and won the argument to
[3:57:13] T1_Draven: @RutgerVerhox fair enough
[3:57:29] Hyperage2003: biggest question is who tommy picked between Jenifer and Triss tommykMONKA
[3:57:33] Vegasmcswagger: @djorn127 Like every run i do i get every single witcher gear and best stuff
[3:57:35] thomas_letrain: If you're still playing a game 20 years latter of course you're werid
[3:57:37] The_Yazoo: tru
[3:57:51] thomas_letrain: They are stuck
[3:57:59] realcoachburger: i wonder if wow is story driven game
[3:58:00] bruxseles: https://imgur.com/a/ZzNoaTa
[3:58:04] Rykkert: stuck in time Aware
[3:58:10] thomas_letrain: @realcoachburger good one
[3:58:12] shar3th: i always felt that wow players are the biggest crybabies
[3:58:12] djorn127: @Vegasmcswagger yeah that's the best sword in the game so no shit hahaha. But it all depends on why you play games. I play for the story first, gameplay second. Witcher 3 is like 65% story and 35% gameplay
[3:58:16] Hyperage2003: @realcoachburger think there is a lot of lore in WOW
[3:58:26] Hyperage2003: So i guess it kinda is
[3:58:32] Bence9811: maybe one day QIAM will be revieved in retail too
[3:59:05] The_Yazoo: big true
[3:59:07] JohnTheTurtleMa: Hoi4 nazis lol not wrong
[3:59:15] RutgerVerhox: Actually true
[3:59:16] JohnTheTurtleMa: Dota 2 not wrong either
[3:59:17] PabloTescobar26: Yeah I think that's one of the main reasons it took so long for me to give WoW a chance. Everyone I speak to who plays it are very weird
[3:59:18] Vegasmcswagger: accoustic?
[3:59:21] Obi_Juan_Chromosome: Cs is all about russians too
[3:59:24] Rullvardt: YEP
[3:59:30] flandre77: rules: no hatespeech
[3:59:30] Lonelywolfski: Just came, any tax talk i missed?
[3:59:34] flandre77: open stream:hatespeech
[3:59:37] Hyperage2003: CS is either you get good people, people who doen't speak or people who scream at you
[3:59:40] Rykkert: bro OMEGALUL
[3:59:43] accypyter: Stellaris has Warcriminals

[3:59:53] listrong7: copelord ICANT
[3:59:55] Vegasmcswagger: @djorn127 i do like the story but my 5 playthroughs have taught me i enjoy gearing up and leveling up more lmao
[4:00:15] Vegasmcswagger: especially after blood and wine where you builld your own shit
[4:00:20] Nightbot: Help out this poor streamer by donating or subbing so he can get better quality for the best HOI4 gameplay.
[4:00:33] PabloTescobar26: R6
[4:00:36] Rykkert: rainbow six is super toxic
[4:00:40] CircleSocialClub: Dota
[4:00:41] ClydeSerious: League, safe
[4:00:43] bruxseles: Try league KEKW
[4:00:51] JohnTheTurtleMa: Dota 2 has the worst comunity
[4:00:53] RutgerVerhox: HABBO when I was 10
[4:00:54] The_Yazoo: Its because all they have is WoW, and lack a lot of social skills
[4:00:58] wakopeenhughmungs: R6 for sure
[4:01:01] teh_chemist: war thunder for me
[4:01:02] RedSwanBestSwan: its bad in raiding as well. Bunch of ego damage dealers that think they are the shit.
[4:01:03] RutgerVerhox: Real predators on there

[4:01:54] PeshMesh: @T1_Draven dude in League legit u ping 1 time accidentally and they start following u around taking ur cs or smiting ur cannons lol
[4:02:03] Pandabotu: russians > germans in cs KEKW
[4:02:03] Hyperage2003: their crazy
[4:02:03] burrize: Im russian and I agree
[4:02:09] letouni: Russians ive met thru videogame just makes me racist asf bro
[4:02:13] PeshMesh: League players are SUPER frgile
[4:02:14] T1_Draven: @PeshMesh yeah I quit league 4 years ago, in dota they will hardflame you but they will never give up the game

[4:02:27] thomas_letrain: Dota is the worst
[4:02:34] hcmraven: aswell with French people
[4:02:35] JohnTheTurtleMa: Plus 50% of those russian gamers use hacks
[4:02:35] ellutiel: Rust has an interesting community LUL
[4:02:41] PeshMesh: @T1_Draven Honestly Riot punishment system encourages this behaviour, they ownt get banned for smiting cannons and afking but will for saying a bad word
[4:02:46] wakopeenhughmungs: oh ya the gmod rp shit is weird
[4:02:57] Soviet_Steel49: any highly comp style of game is toxic
[4:02:57] VvVictimize: French and Brasillians are also annoying
[4:03:02] thomas_letrain: when you don't have anything, why should you care
[4:03:04] TheVolfas: Playing vs russians on pokerstars made me racist
[4:03:08] CircleSocialClub: So can we conclude that competitive team games are most toxic?
[4:03:09] Bence9811: poker game with chat somewhen?
[4:03:09] letouni: I always play with 7-2 for the memes KEKW
[4:03:11] Hyperage2003: @ellutiel agree, could'nt handle rust, kids screaming in my ear everytime they killed me
