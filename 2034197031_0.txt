[0:31:06] B3nbu: :D
[0:31:15] AGuyWithPants: true and real, dont look at my char
[0:31:23] B3nbu: don't look at mine KEKW
[0:31:45] Nuitsible: idk how ppl can enjoy playing Aug yeah
[0:32:30] AGuyWithPants: aug is fun until u have to raid on it
[0:32:37] AvalenaTV: wdym? aug is super fun, you can prepare some food, watch a movie on 2nd screen, study for university and still time your 28s
[0:33:25] gramark: gramark subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:33:28] nicht_oli__: aug is the most rio inflated spec in the game and should be nuked from wow , imagine releasing a spec that just by existing deletes 90% of all the dps specs
[0:33:32] Nuitsible: sus
[0:35:12] AvalenaTV: @nicht_oli__ its fine rn isnt it? its no longer the pick for both survivability and raw dmg since 3 dps are just better than bringing a aug. many top comps start swapping back from aug to regular combs
[0:35:56] AvalenaTV: i think aug is in a decent spot, could be slightly adjusted but over all we're heading to the right direction^^
[0:36:12] Nuitsible: well Aug dont just increase dps, its increase survivability. In lower key you dont really need thats much dps if you dont die, Aug privide that
[0:36:23] B3nbu: heading in the right direction to never see it again hopefully
[0:36:35] AvalenaTV: @Nuitsible it used to be both top dps and survivability, blizzard changed that
[0:36:40] nicht_oli__: @AvalenaTV still no argument for aug beeing fine , its nerfed so hard that its not worth anymore , the problem still is in the game its just a numbers problem
[0:36:58] B3nbu: "not worth anymore"
[0:37:01] mpnooo: sabaton pepeJAMJAM
[0:37:11] B3nbu: i see aug on screen right now
[0:37:15] B3nbu: maybe im watching a vod

[0:38:10] Zerianix: how do you get a bigwigs profile that calls cc like yours?
[0:38:16] nicht_oli__: blizz should just let the community vote , remove aug or remove aug , maybe a third option remove aug
[0:38:19] Nuitsible: I heard Blizzard is allowing ppl to vote for wow future, lets vote for Aug futur
[0:38:24] AvalenaTV: i mean ppl are playing 2x mage 1x rogue instead of aug to still have enough survivability. dont fool yourself that your hunter would have a spot instead of the aug if aug wasnt a thing :D
[0:38:24] vital_ni: @NekoBeLike WAs
[0:38:27] aarseths: Not a single person complaining in chat has ever done any content that cant be done without aug. Why are you complaining so much

[0:39:24] Stahn1993: now this is a boomie pumper comp
[0:39:27] sleshflex: @aarseths  tbh is wrong even mythic fyrakk cant be doen without and alot of ppl did it already
[0:39:28] B3nbu: it's the art of living
[0:39:44] Titanwep: where is meeres tdy
[0:40:11] aarseths: Yes but they keep complaining like children, just like Asmongold... Its fine, you dont ever need an evoker for any of the content you do so just move on
[0:40:26] AvalenaTV: the same ppl overly complaining about aug are the ppl that play non meta specs and cry about that then :D the tears always flow, just the direction differs
[0:40:27] Kingcoconutcrab: @Titanwep meeres is nonverbal today
[0:40:31] sleshflex: im pro evoker so no complaint from me i think evoker only sin is that is still the only support spec

[1:19:59] Confused95_: I see nothing lmao
[1:21:04] sleshflex: imagine how good the game would be without affixes
[1:21:25] rootkit1337tv: which profile did you change btw @Naowh there is 3 inside
[1:21:25] ejnarsson320: imagine how good the game would be with good affixes
[1:21:30] rootkit1337tv: omnicd
[1:21:42] zebbzo91: storming on this boss is cancer
[1:21:43] Axestro: I wonder if it would get boring with no affix rotation.
[1:22:12] sleshflex: affixes accomplish nothing otyher than being annoying
[1:22:31] wtflowbob: wtflowbob subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[1:22:55] Maakanv: Rip
[1:22:59] Axestro: @sleshflex I agree. Most of them are just silly and annoying. But i wonder still if things would get a bit stale if we had nothing changing weekly.
[1:23:00] Maakanv: Time to go Non-Verbal
[1:23:34] linguinetoes: Voice of an angel
[1:23:37] sleshflex: @Axestro  yeah it would be stale caus eu can play every week
[1:23:38] Confused95_: poor mike gets slammed with the "u do disc dmg" lmao
[1:23:43] imppally: tank pov of this fight, just singing why healer is struggeling
[1:23:49] Maakanv: How singing when non-verbal hmm
[1:23:59] Axestro: @sleshflex I play every week even if the affixes sucks though :P
[1:24:07] murfflex: murfflex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[1:24:26] sleshflex: yeah but thats addiction cause ther eis no shot someoen plays willingly bolstering/sanguine weeks
[1:24:31] sleshflex: for example
[1:24:51] Confused95_: personal preferance I would say
[1:24:57] Axestro: Hehe, i dont push those weeks, but i still do keys.
[1:25:14] sleshflex: yeah but i mean for lwoer keys
[1:25:20] sleshflex: affixes really dotn chaneg anything
[1:25:24] Confused95_: yeah, I dont love to play sanguine but its not annoying enough to stop playing whole week
[1:25:48] StreamElements: Follow my Social Medias! Instagram.com/naowh | Twitter.com/naowhxd | Youtube.com/naowhgaming
[1:25:58] linguinetoes: What are the affixes coming up this week?
[1:26:00] Confused95_: I still like the aspect that every week is at least a bit different
[1:26:10] sleshflex: so they just change things for ppl pushing highest rio score and soem affixes are just too much
[1:26:12] Guffels: afflicted bolstering
[1:26:18] eis___: why are you taking felblade?
[1:26:54] Guffels: idk i think incorp and afflicted were good affixes. just really locks warrior and dk out.
[1:26:55] sleshflex: liek storming on paper is a free affix, reality is that it really remvoes your will to play as a tank
[1:27:01] Axestro: @sleshflex Dunno what lower keys means for you. But i play in the 18-22 range during bad weeks. And it impacts the keys for dure.
[1:27:09] Axestro: *sure
[1:27:33] boomshapedpleasure: i think u boys need to get zelia sick to push, just an idea
[1:27:33] Confused95_: I think u are a bit dramatic to be honest
[1:27:37] Axestro: Especially bolstering in places like EB. It's so bad.

[1:28:48] Guffels: I want explosive back but it increases your highest secondary by 3-5% for every one you kill. watch the dps fight over the last hits lol
[1:28:51] toique: no captain route is the way
[1:28:55] toique: lets go
[1:30:05] Confused95_: yeah I always liked the idea to get a benefit from every affix u play good and get a penaltlty if u fu them up
[1:30:06] AGuyWithPants: can mage solo a captain?
[1:30:24] sleshflex: @Guffels  explosives had the easiest fix ever wich shoudl have been. 1 explosive spawn with hp baes on the amount of mobs u in comabt with and if u kill it does his hp in dmg split witht he mobs u are fighting so ther eis no dps loss in killing it
[1:30:28] Addictedlol89: who is the 3rd dps?
[1:30:31] Addictedlol89: im confused
[1:30:33] toique: sun affix done today? or incoming soon?
[1:30:33] Nuitsible: mage 2nd support?
[1:30:34] Addictedlol89: im new
[1:30:53] AGuyWithPants: clickz
[1:30:56] AGuyWithPants: is 3rd dps
[1:31:02] Addictedlol89: he has no dps?
[1:31:03] AGuyWithPants: hes just bad at the game
[1:31:09] speels414: lol
[1:31:12] Addictedlol89: is he mainly single target dps
[1:31:21] Confused95_: Augmentation Evoker
[1:31:25] speels414: more utility
[1:31:25] Axestro: @Addictedlol89 He has some dps, but mainly buffs the rest of the party. Tank gets more tanky, healer heals more, dps does more dps.
[1:31:26] Tsrif: No he is paying for a boost
[1:31:26] SchwiegMorder: his spec buffs other dps, he's a "support" style dps
[1:31:35] Tsrif: this is a sale 29 key
[1:31:40] AGuyWithPants: hes the red mage of dps
[1:31:45] Addictedlol89: Ty for legit answers
[1:32:04] moodsen: the 3 incher?
[1:32:22] Confused95_: storming goes for a good spin I would imagine
[1:32:35] sleshflex: playign prot pala on stormign week is a blast
[1:33:01] Axestro: *stormed out og conc - dead* Good times.
[1:33:27] LightdarkGaming: already dead
[1:33:28] Confused95_: how
[1:34:42] sleshflex: @Axestro  exactly cause u know for a multimilionare company is to hard to give pala a buff when he cast consecration that last same time as consecration that gives you consecrate so u cna have benefit from mastery
[1:35:29] Axestro: @sleshflex Yep - it's fun. But you can freedom on cd though. Kappa
