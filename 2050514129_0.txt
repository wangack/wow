[0:24:37] sunileif: heathen aslso a judeochristian slur for non believer
[0:24:49] sunileif: SPOILERS YA!
[0:24:53] al_capow: feel about what??
[0:24:56] un_heilig: spoil me payoOld
[0:24:56] nyzeofc: 99% have checked the runes anyways
[0:24:57] al_capow: heyo
[0:24:58] sunileif: do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it
[0:25:11] al_capow: oh I love me some spoilers
[0:25:15] al_capow: unless its a show
[0:25:23] al_capow: then my gf spoils it for me
[0:25:43] zachgamegodx: shadow priest rogue looks gross for the cup, I think dazed and those guys will end up swapping to it
[0:26:02] sunileif: mes get the fur-endship mount ;3
[0:26:03] un_heilig: druide mhm
[0:26:18] al_capow: the only thing that's weird for me is the priest multi renew is a rune, but for druid it's a skill book
[0:27:06] un_heilig: wtf
[0:27:24] zachgamegodx: a lot of things that beat sp rogue on the past isn’t as strong as it was in the past I feel like
[0:27:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Classic plus, pog
[0:27:35] artsskeit: no changes has turned into fuck it lets mix things up
[0:27:42] zachgamegodx: what does good into it?
[0:28:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: One influential guy calls it a "Classic adjacent" experience
[0:28:28] un_heilig: class diversity is a big thing of classic or used to be
[0:28:39] Imagine_TBH: Is SoD successful?
[0:28:50] sunileif: testing for retail?
[0:28:54] Begasaur: evening
[0:29:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure, SoD is successful
[0:29:01] artsskeit: i think its both but i think they can say they gave people the nochange classic in 2019 now its time to improve upon it
[0:29:29] un_heilig: idk tbh im just a wow nerd I think I would hate wow if I was a dev for it tbh lol
[0:30:03] Imagine_TBH: The world was a huge part of actual vanilla wow. A huge sprawling world with no load screens. Things weren't instanced, you could run in to anyone etc.
[0:30:04] TheEyeVII: @wEiRdO_dUdE it''ll be sucessful while phases get hyped after 60 it'll die like classic era>som>hc>etc
[0:30:12] rekroyal: getting in some 3s tonight?
[0:30:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've heard from a few Classic people that it's too much, but in general most people are having fun in it
[0:30:36] Begasaur: u could do uldaman too
[0:30:37] zachgamegodx: I don’t like it one bit, I think trying to mix modern class design with the old talent tree feels rly bad and primary reason I didn’t put any time into sod really
[0:30:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: @TheEyeVII That's why they did it as just a season, to try it out, yeah it's going to end
[0:30:47] artsskeit: im hoping the gdkp ban is a sign they're willing to be bold and see what is popular
[0:30:49] TheEyeVII: @Imagine_TBH 20 years ago there was no social media either and fewer games and less tech
[0:30:56] Begasaur: i think theres some drops that are 40
[0:31:07] Imagine_TBH: I remember I had a horde "friend" while levelling. We kept the same level, met up in the same zones, gank each other occasionally, then we met in BGs at 60... They they changed how servers work and I never saw him again
[0:31:11] zachgamegodx: I’d prefer they remove the old talent tree completely
[0:31:18] un_heilig: mhmm makes sense
[0:31:36] Imagine_TBH: @TheEyeVII and the world was a much closer place
[0:31:36] TheEyeVII: @wEiRdO_dUdE pretty much
[0:31:39] un_heilig: its way too much shit
[0:32:08] artsskeit: i think its great.  the talent tree stays and runes are kinda like more recent talent trees where you had a choice of 3 skills per tier
[0:32:08] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:32:16] CSmitty917: remember when that daunting feeling was the other way around
[0:32:21] artsskeit: so you get the incremental upgrades and then bam a really impactful ability
[0:32:26] everquest101: whate ach class need is a pvp talen three and dedicated pvp sets
[0:32:33] Imagine_TBH: They give WoW that talent tree but then give D4 that basic linear path tree :(
[0:32:40] un_heilig: its the PoE influence ^^
[0:32:46] TheEyeVII: classic was never made to be complicated clearly, all classic content is LFR level difficulty so makes sense the talents are easily understandable
[0:32:47] artsskeit: respec cost being wiped with p2 would be amazing
[0:32:49] everquest101: mixin pve emchanics on pvp just doesnt work  well
[0:32:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: The large respec cost was so burdensome, true
[0:33:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: I used to have to respec for PvP every weekend, then back for PvE during the week
[0:33:36] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:33:41] TheEyeVII: @notmes I agree
[0:33:41] ADiDough: are aug evokers dead in arena now?
[0:33:52] un_heilig: blizzard used to be good at taking others ideas and master them these days they are mediocre at it
[0:34:29] everquest101: fair point
[0:34:36] al_capow: i think it's OK to need to pvp to get pve gear, but not vice versa
[0:34:36] Imagine_TBH: I like the new wow Talent trees, but coming back to the game I'm just stealing builds without really learning fully. I can see how you would be much more in tune if you had to level with the tree, not just buy a boost and have to learn what everything does all at once
[0:34:37] TheEyeVII: pve should do something relatively good in pvp, but it is a hot take I guess
[0:34:48] artsskeit: it should be you can pve or pvp to get a great set, to get the absolute best you should have to do more than one activity
[0:34:53] al_capow: worst thing about retail is that you need to hit a specific ilvl before you can even join rated arena
[0:35:17] freshdots321: thats not a bad thing
[0:35:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[0:35:24] un_heilig: you're right
[0:35:26] TheEyeVII: @al_capow that's not really true aside for solo shuf but if you actually wanna win ya it's kinda true
[0:35:56] wyldeshock: hey dude
[0:36:16] Anhak: Dagger rogue meta im pogging out of my mind mes!
[0:36:25] artsskeit: but no gear will save people from p2 ele
[0:36:26] nikthevoker: they werent even playing retail asking for it
[0:36:31] TheEyeVII: that's called irony I guess
[0:36:41] nikthevoker: stoopz and staysafe rigjt?
[0:36:48] artsskeit: anhak are you on CS
[0:37:04] TheEyeVII: @nikthevoker savix as well, alot of "loud voices" did
[0:37:06] un_heilig: nah you're right dude. also most of us see it as a fan point of aspect instead of being a dev
[0:37:08] Anhak: @artsskeit yea yea we got a comunity guild on cs
[0:37:33] sngtokos: @notmes when to play defile+dots plaguebringer and when claw in shuffle?
[0:38:16] TheEyeVII: if you wanna be realistic you can blame people asking for things they don't know they don't want, but then again we got classic that way so we never know
[0:38:53] un_heilig: blizz might be fing up but with HC and SoD
[0:38:59] un_heilig: they are lisiting to fans
[0:39:00] artsskeit: where da shadowstrike team be at
[0:39:13] zachgamegodx: aka buff dks
[0:39:21] Imagine_TBH: I think trinkets and weapons should be the main pvp items, so people don't get stuck farming one high ilevel trinket from M+ for 40 weeks, but the rest can be from either the pvp path or the pve path imo
[0:39:27] ZallKlos: couldn't get bobby angry
[0:39:44] un_heilig: true
[0:39:45] TheEyeVII: devs are employees and we're consumers so ya it's a different pov/perspective
[0:40:17] ZallKlos: isn't the issue with player feedback is like half want 1 thing, the other half wants the opposite?
[0:40:45] ZallKlos: buff weak class or nerf OP classes
[0:40:57] Hakash: What spot did u guys get for awc?
[0:40:59] TheEyeVII: @ZallKlos it's way worse with an MMO as well cuz there's so many pocket activities and pocket communities within a single game
[0:41:01] artsskeit: no.  buff my class, nerf others
[0:41:06] artsskeit: all classes that beat mine are OP
[0:41:18] un_heilig: the issue is that retail and classic fans are divided. it been like that for too long wow fans hating on eachother
[0:41:31] moowoom1: @artsskeit whats your class lol?
[0:41:48] AngryStapler: nerf everyone but my class too
[0:41:52] un_heilig: dont mention classic or retail here in this stream when its the same game
[0:41:53] artsskeit: shaman
[0:42:03] TheEyeVII: @un_heilig I don't think so, I think the "classic fans" were actually private server players who've been hating retail for a long time
[0:42:11] AngryStapler: Classic Retail when?
[0:42:16] artsskeit: this is the most torn ive ever been.  resto/ele but now this totem makes me want to reroll to be a tauren and get that totem
[0:42:34] AngryStapler: I cant wait for classic Dragonflight
[0:42:48] ZallKlos: the too much dmg at low mmr  vs too much damp at high mmr
[0:42:48] artsskeit: !link
[0:42:51] un_heilig: @TheEyeVII bro you cant tell me that you didnt see the hate between classic andys and retail andys
[0:43:06] AngryStapler: I liked the end of BFA. The corruption was a bit too grindy is all
[0:43:15] artsskeit: theres a 40dps 2h weapon thats shaman only from bloodmoon
[0:43:20] sunileif: +moutn
[0:43:28] artsskeit: which is a totem and has a mace stun proc
[0:43:28] sunileif: FUR-endship
[0:43:30] TheEyeVII: DF is unironically one of the best xpac for "systems"  of all time imo, story was meh to ok
[0:43:40] sunileif: krOwOme will be proud
[0:43:43] ZallKlos: are you going to turn beefdaddyx into a magical girl?
[0:43:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: With death knights being broken at launch, Wrath definitely had a rocky start. Casters were freaking out
[0:44:06] Anhak: o yea 1st of the month!
[0:44:09] un_heilig: all are WoW fans but there is such a big divide between classic and retail its insane
[0:44:10] Anhak: gotta log retail
[0:44:26] nikthevoker: just tryna find 3s RIP
[0:44:29] Begasaur: i thought the items this month were garbo
[0:44:43] Solastro: this is the best trading post they've ever done
[0:45:02] sunileif: a lunar fest tradign post woulda been great
[0:45:33] Solastro: i hope they have diff colors of the shoulder cape every month
[0:45:43] TheEyeVII: @un_heilig ya but the loud ones  were private servers andies imo and the divide was made through social media/streams
[0:45:46] un_heilig: I dont play female chars tbh
[0:45:57] un_heilig: femae orc maybe but thats it
[0:46:01] alireza00700: All trash blizzard always find a way to put trash mogs in trading post @notmes
[0:46:15] sunileif: theyre fun
[0:46:22] sunileif: people forgot what that is
[0:46:30] un_heilig: tru
[0:46:38] AngryStapler: @sunileif no fun allowed
[0:46:39] Solastro: they're amazing, my whole twitter feed is all people looking cute as fuck
[0:46:45] TheEyeVII: @un_heilig same as politics/red vs blue/ tribalism/NA vs EU/just classic human nature things
[0:46:46] Anhak: options later and stuff yea
[0:47:16] un_heilig: @TheEyeVII I feel that
[0:47:54] Anhak: the idea is to get you to play to obtain stuff but i just log in get free shit sometimes spend it
[0:48:04] alireza00700: I mean what is this fullset LUL
[0:48:09] sunileif: FUR-ENDSHIP FOX
[0:48:14] Solastro: i just had a lotta fun looking at the comments under blizz's instagram post about the new items, so many fragile male egos angry that everything is pink
[0:48:17] TheEyeVII: trading post is kinda made as a bait now so people feel like they have to buy more off the store instead of wasting points, might be a hot take TwitchConHYPE
[0:48:40] Axesmittayyy: wonder if they’ll have stuff for the “year of the dragon” in the trading post
[0:48:47] Anhak: yep way to get people to stay subbed
[0:48:52] WalleBrew: you ever think they will bring things back like the MoP challenge mode gear or other discontinued items?
[0:48:52] AngryStapler: I think trading post was a nice addition. Just a small bit of fun and you earn currency doing random things you already do
[0:48:57] un_heilig: free xmogs n shit
[0:49:03] Anhak: its a good add
[0:49:07] AngryStapler: ^
[0:49:17] disquared: !gamble 5000
[0:49:17] StreamElements: disquared lost 5000 runes in roulette and now has 2890888 runes! FeelsBadMan
[0:49:26] Anhak: ASLONG AS IT DOESNT start adding like AOTC and previous CM stuff or glad stuff etc good add i should *
[0:49:41] dreadxbleedinghollow: yoo im short and i like your stream so your title makes sense
[0:49:42] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:49:51] un_heilig: i love me some free xmogs
[0:49:51] WalleBrew: !gamble 1000
[0:49:51] StreamElements: WalleBrew lost 1000 runes in roulette and now has 14028575 runes! FeelsBadMan
[0:50:14] TheEyeVII: "the twilight pack" - "leaves the shop indefinitely on feb 29th" it's def a temp fomo, also if you buy it you save your trading post points, unfortunate
[0:50:35] freshdots321: How do we play with you?
[0:50:45] nikthevoker: fuuck it think its just a shuffle angle LFG way too boring LUL
[0:50:45] freshdots321: or what are you looking for sorry
[0:51:21] Solastro: @TheEyeVII they said it leaves the shop, then will be on a future trading post in 3 months
[0:51:37] sunileif: no thats exclusive
[0:51:38] TheEyeVII: @Solastro that's my guess
[0:51:42] dreadxbleedinghollow: are you team edward or team jacob?
[0:51:43] Anhak: its different yea
[0:51:47] Solastro: its not a guess
[0:51:50] Solastro: they stated it
[0:51:54] sunileif: buy now or rip
[0:51:56] WalleBrew: is it just more purple
[0:52:21] TheEyeVII: well regardless it's bad, but it is what it is @Solastro
[0:52:21] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:52:24] Solastro: they said in the small print of the shop offer that the items will appear in the trading post in the future, you can just pay now to have early access tmog
[0:52:26] Solastro: thats it
[0:52:44] Solastro: @TheEyeVII how is it bad, its literally early access cosmetics
[0:53:08] WalleBrew: MoP challenge mode / mage tower and things like that need to come back
[0:53:38] WalleBrew: not for repurchase but new material like that within the game :)
[0:54:32] TheEyeVII: @Solastro it's a fomo item to incentivize people to buy it so one can save their trading post points for other items, pretty obvious to me LUL
[0:55:02] Onca4242: 190k lol
[0:55:23] honsou2: whats ur stats, still high haste?
[0:55:29] xiliketurtlex: rdruid is full geared

[0:56:06] xiliketurtlex: typical rdruid with low vers
[0:56:20] Solushun: is this a short stream or a Mes short stream KEKW
[0:57:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tomorrow at 1 PM EST on the Warcraft channel, AWC!
[0:59:40] TheEyeVII: @Solastro if you think about it, it's a mount+ full set so that'd be at least what 800+800 points or more, you potentially save 1/2 months worth of points, it's just a classic high pressure filthy marketing strat
[1:06:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Mes transmog may or may not appear in the new trailer for AWC season 3
[1:06:41] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:07:04] sunileif: mes when will they give blood elves beards
[1:07:51] sunileif: how many years were we stuck in northrend in the middle of a war with the undead and shaving was somehow a priority?

[4:42:13] IamWalnuts: ive had a blood dk in shuffle play team shell and shell hunter traps
[4:42:32] ariacy: I swear I can get upwards of 200k death strikes as blood
[4:43:21] waitimdesyncd: @ariacy  you can actually get it quite higher than 200k if you are human with double dps trinket LUL
[4:45:24] drbonghitmd: do you think shadow priest should be in a better place? whats holding it back (if its not in a good spot)
[4:49:10] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd  Shadow priests just have to cast a lot. They are super tanky, and can look really OP, but you might need to be a SP main, since learning SP this meta isnt as easy as pretty much any other classs
[4:49:11] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[4:50:08] drbonghitmd: seems like even if you were a good sp, a 1800 DH has about a 75% chance of just rolling you over
[4:51:04] drbonghitmd: ww monks even more, DKs a little less, warriors a little less, sub rogues a little less, demo a little less, ele a little less
[4:51:15] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd  Tbf, most classes have the same, if not even worse LUL DH melts everyone on ladder
[4:51:47] drbonghitmd: every spec in the game except for mage will destroy a SP though
[4:52:18] waitimdesyncd: Yeah, if you play 2s, but in 3s Spriest brings utility that makes that untrue
[4:52:42] drbonghitmd: together with the fact that 3/4 shuffle lobbies are an arms war/dk/ww or sub rogue
[4:52:55] drbonghitmd: or DH ofc
[4:53:29] waitimdesyncd: Idk if I can fully agree with dk/ww/sub every lobby. DK and Sub rogues have the 2 lowest win ratings in SOlo shuffle
[4:54:23] drbonghitmd: some combination of WW monk, rogue, warrior DH and DK
[4:54:35] drbonghitmd: if youre not playing a melee you better be 3k xp to crack 2k
[4:54:43] waitimdesyncd: And if you feel like SP dies fast to arms war/ww then you wouldnt wanna know how the DK feels about that lobby
[4:54:48] drbonghitmd: well nvm cause demo locks exist
[4:54:53] DontDv8: whats the small friendly nameplate addon you use?
[4:54:55] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd  LUL bruh
[4:55:48] drbonghitmd: in a lobby with arms war, ww monk, dk and sp im pretty sure everyone would run down the sp every round
[4:56:03] happyheals: Just realized Lord Mes is the Horde Captain in Ashran
[4:56:47] drbonghitmd: and then on the dmg meter it would look like the sp was a healer
[4:57:18] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd  yeah they go you so they can kick you, but that doesnt mean youre the one who dies the fastest
[4:57:22] drbonghitmd: DHs will kick VT and then put a sigil fear down that will pre interrupt the SP's 30k dmg mind spike just to make sure the sp doesnt get 30 thousand dmg off
[4:57:28] waitimdesyncd: especially not as sp/dk or sp/ww
[4:57:54] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd  the shadow priests that play not hit 300k mind spikes, but 30k LUL
[4:58:02] waitimdesyncd: now*
[4:58:17] drbonghitmd: if its an insanity mind spike
[4:58:19] waitimdesyncd: not 30K holy shit sorry im apparently a  monkey at typing this morning :(
[4:58:26] drbonghitmd: non insanity mind spikes hit for wet noodles

[4:59:17] StreamElements: muygrandemicah just subscribed for 44 months in a row mesDad mesDad mesWeckso
[4:59:21] waitimdesyncd: SP priests are relatively rare rn, But the ones I meet around 2.2k are kinda nutty to be honestly, and I love playing dev/sp actually because the sp can setup insane setups
[4:59:57] drbonghitmd: my sp is about 2320 mmr and its so miserable ill never q it ever again
[5:00:03] ineteroo: dev is so op
[5:00:19] drbonghitmd: yeah a devokr will do 4x the dmg of an SP with just 1 button
[5:00:28] ineteroo: i just funny how you did so big dam with disintegrate
[5:00:55] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd  Yeah, but you can play with the dev and make the kills happens by ccing when the dev has pressure and not before
[5:01:23] drbonghitmd: yeah stun silence is good, fear is about useless because by the time youre ontop of their healer youve already died
[5:02:00] drbonghitmd: stun silence and swap
[5:02:45] feninr: hey @notmes long time chatter 1st time fan Fen here, i got a question regarding WA's, i have a WA pack that double counts the CD how do i fix that?
[5:02:47] drbonghitmd: stun is usually DRd anyways because rogues and DHs in every lobby just keep everything DRd
[5:02:48] waitimdesyncd: Yeah you use fear when they go to you, you dont waste 20 sec trying to get a fear
[5:03:14] waitimdesyncd: Stun is usually DR'd in ANY comp, that has nothing to do with spriest comps
[5:03:32] drbonghitmd: yeah i mean if their healer pushes ontop of our pillar where im standing with fear up
[5:03:51] drbonghitmd: meanwhile the DH is doing 130k dps
[5:04:15] waitimdesyncd: Yeah but you cant go around and envy other peoples damage
[5:04:18] waitimdesyncd: that doesnt get you any rating
[5:04:34] drbonghitmd: i actually can because i have lots of time while im locked out to look at the dmg meter
[5:04:54] waitimdesyncd: make a dev or dh alt and go pump yourself, learn how to beat them
[5:05:26] waitimdesyncd: and if you get locked out then you should work on faking,  because in this meta, you want to force them to use their actual CC and stuns to stop your casts
[5:06:08] drbonghitmd: yeah that could be my problem idk i try to bait kick in the beginnign with torrent ofc, then i cast spikes and get insta locked out again and then stunned and then sigil feared to interrupt whatever i cast next
[5:06:24] drbonghitmd: if they dont flat out give me precog i cant do even 1/3rd of their dmg
[5:06:50] drbonghitmd: seems like im def playing the spec blizz doesnt want people playing
[5:07:09] waitimdesyncd: sometimes youre forced to just purge a lot and pull melees into a bad position by, or being ready to push in and cc while your teammate has pressure, not before
[5:08:05] drbonghitmd: meanwhile melee players will ignore everything happening in the game outside of my cast bar and their pve rotation

[5:09:28] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd LUL I feel like that is kinda close minded
[5:09:28] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:09:53] waitimdesyncd: Melees all die to DH, its not like they survive any longer
[5:10:15] drbonghitmd: its not about living longer its about having a way to win the game
[5:10:26] drbonghitmd: and what that condition is
[5:10:32] waitimdesyncd: Like when they played against mage/feral, and they go feral beause he has the highest train-rate in the game LUL
[5:10:45] waitimdesyncd: Imagine being feral and being the kill target in any comp
[5:11:01] drbonghitmd: you would do more dmg than sp...
[5:11:09] drbonghitmd: by a lot
[5:11:28] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd  Not by a lot, but they have big burst so they can do something when they connect
[5:11:28] drbonghitmd: you can at least go out there and pop a 3min dmg cd and maybe win
[5:12:06] waitimdesyncd: @drbonghitmd LUL You should just play what you think is OP then, go prove yourself wrong or right
[5:12:40] drbonghitmd: i play 9 healers and 2 caster dps, blizz says healers should quit so im trying to play caster dps
[5:12:46] drbonghitmd: i guess i need a 12th alt
[5:12:55] waitimdesyncd: My point is just that it is always going to be easier to blame something else than yourself, even tho SP might be one of the ones that feel like they have the right to complain (even tho there are many specs that do much much worse on the dying department)
[5:13:24] uninstallspeedrun: victim andy

[5:51:33] johnnythunderbunny: my ex made me move back to vegas. my nieces keep me there
[5:51:51] johnnythunderbunny: not the cost of living
[5:52:02] johnnythunderbunny: but i'd live on like monterey coast if anywhere
[5:52:33] johnnythunderbunny: my first place here was a 1100 sq ft house in santa clara, rent for $3500/month
[5:52:43] sneakynaki: Damn, sounds like Vancouver for Canada
[5:52:57] johnnythunderbunny: vancouver is more expensive lol but it's close
[5:53:04] johnnythunderbunny: bro you have to make 100k+ to live here
[5:53:09] johnnythunderbunny: and that's not a good existence
[5:53:36] ScenarioLabs: 2080 hours
[5:53:41] johnnythunderbunny: 25 pay periods right
[5:53:45] sneakynaki: I"m chillin in the Yukon myself haha, 700$/m for a what they call "dry cabine"
[5:53:47] ScenarioLabs: 260 days
[5:54:26] johnnythunderbunny: i bought a house in silicon valley for 900k and sold it for 1.2m 9 months later
[5:54:44] johnnythunderbunny: then bought a house for 1.2m in vegas. 1200sq ft -> 4200 sq ft with a pool
[5:54:50] sneakynaki: @johnnythunderbunny is it like Vancouver where everything is bought by uber rich people and they control the market?
[5:55:03] avenueone: in melbourne in aus u just buy a standard 4x2 for 1 million now
[5:55:06] johnnythunderbunny: no there's just a ton of million->billionaires living here and working in tech
[5:55:37] johnnythunderbunny: they're really high here
[5:55:47] johnnythunderbunny: it's like 7-8% yea
[5:55:51] Shaengus: NZ gets even more fucked than sydney with chinese peeps buying property etc, its wild
[5:56:14] sneakynaki: @Shaengus That's what happened to Vancouver......
[5:56:15] johnnythunderbunny: i'd live in NZ if quin wasn't my neighbor
[5:56:24] sneakynaki: ^
[5:56:40] Shaengus: quin's in whanganui isnt he
[5:56:48] johnnythunderbunny: my now-gf lived in nz for like 6 months
[5:56:53] johnnythunderbunny: for fun
[5:57:01] Shaengus: pretty sure
[5:57:04] sneakynaki: NZ sounds like a cool place
[5:57:07] johnnythunderbunny: say that word again
[5:57:23] johnnythunderbunny: ok you just said it fast nvm
[5:57:34] Shaengus: i worked with a chick from there, it is fong
[5:57:35] sneakynaki: @notmes Are you from NZ or Australia?
[5:57:40] avenueone: id rather move to nz than back to aus if it wasnt for family just because aus wants me to get a script to vape instead of smoking ciggies and nz has a very lax approach
[5:58:05] al3xavr0s: smoke some crack then
[5:58:11] al3xavr0s: no prescription
[5:58:25] avenueone: its actually easier to smoke crack and quit smoking crack in aus than cigs
[5:58:38] sneakynaki: What?!
[5:58:40] avenueone: nicotine with no script yes
[5:58:44] johnnythunderbunny: ????????
[5:58:51] johnnythunderbunny: but you can buy cigarettes???
[5:58:58] avenueone: yes
[5:58:59] johnnythunderbunny: bro what in the fuck
[5:59:01] al3xavr0s: smoke a cigie mate
[5:59:11] avenueone: its because vaping ruins their tobacco excise tax
[5:59:16] johnnythunderbunny: you thought US did capitalism good
[5:59:18] sneakynaki: IS it because they can't tax vape as much as cigies?
[5:59:29] avenueone: ya
[5:59:36] avenueone: tax on cigs is extremely high in aus
[5:59:40] al3xavr0s: here is 4.50 a pack of 20. pretty sexy price for yalls expensive ass countries
[5:59:43] johnnythunderbunny: i don't do nicotine but that's bullshit
[5:59:48] Shaengus: its like $41 for a 25 pack of darts, it's fried
[5:59:49] indithedog: random question what percent of players are glad rating
[5:59:58] sneakynaki: They banned 0% nicotine vape juice in Canada cause they couldn't tax it LUL
[6:00:01] indithedog: ballpark
[6:00:02] johnnythunderbunny: because so many ppl have quit smoking for vape at the least and some quit smoking completely
[6:00:05] moldybread00: @notmes is there any way to get your plater profile to not have such noisy distracting nameplates? im new to it and i just downloaded ur profile
[6:00:12] indithedog: ok ty
[6:00:13] yourKnightmaare: can someone tell me why I only ever earn one splinter a week? I have done both pvp weeklies, the emerald dream weekly and lfr and can't get a second splinter :(
[6:00:35] avenueone: when i last smoked cigs i was spending bout $50-75 a day on smoking
[6:00:38] yourKnightmaare: oh damn.
[6:00:42] yourKnightmaare: rip my life
[6:00:49] avenueone: and then vaping went down to like <$5 a day
[6:01:02] bransby09: Vaping buying juice is way cheaper than disposables
[6:01:02] sneakynaki: Vaping is cheaper for me up in the Yukon
[6:01:10] avenueone: infinitely cheaper to vape
[6:01:16] al3xavr0s: smoking some lil cigarillos from camel, 1.50euro per pack of 10
[6:01:35] sneakynaki: They do tax vape juice in canada
[6:01:39] johnnythunderbunny: anyone see anything dope on the hub lately
[6:01:41] sneakynaki: price increased in recent years
[6:01:44] johnnythunderbunny: got any recos
[6:02:27] avenueone: just be over 18
[6:02:38] avenueone: vape in places smokers would
[6:02:43] avenueone: not sure
[6:03:05] TheCursedPepe: Hey! On which server should i play on retail? (Im in EU)
[6:03:06] johnnythunderbunny: i was in NYC last week. apparently you can smoke pot legally anywhere you can smoke cigarettes
[6:03:08] sneakynaki: @notmes For exemple a pack of cigarettes in the Yukon is between 18-25$. a bottle of juice is like 25$. Bottle lasts 2weeks+ a pack lasts 1-2 days  for me at least
[6:03:09] johnnythunderbunny: which is dope
[6:03:12] avenueone: i didnt think it was that bad i was buying my stuff from nz when i was in aus
[6:03:21] johnnythunderbunny: @TheCursedPepe something EST for best case latency
[6:03:25] avenueone: i bought 5 years of nicotine for <$100
[6:03:28] avenueone: to mix myself
[6:03:40] johnnythunderbunny: just inject it with an IV EZ
[6:03:42] TheCursedPepe: @johnnythunderbunny but what about the population
