[0:04:40] lucaniusTV: Oh ok

[0:26:18] Dogewiz: there is 0 chance the release is on the first because they said they want to give us time to lvl for tbc. 2 weeks to lvl if pp is on the 18th would be little to no time for casual players
[0:26:32] Alexkayzz: towQueen
[0:26:46] SlayerLightStorm: Went to bed at 8 pm last night, woke up at around 2:30 this morning. Stayed in bed 'til around 3 am, then got up. Got some pizza rolls for a snack, and a serving of The Juice Gfuel.
[0:26:55] jeziorek: lvl what? u had like 2 years to level
[0:27:03] jeziorek: paladint didnt start at 60 in tbc anyway
[0:27:05] Dogewiz: for horde pallys and alli shams

[0:27:23] Dogewiz: people want time to lvl those
[0:27:38] jeziorek: well they can after release
[0:27:40] Dogewiz: 2 weeks before launch is enough time for players who play everyday but casuals will pull the short end of the straw
[0:27:58] A_New_Challenger: Lol - went to bed at midnight woke up and went to eat cold pepperoni pinwheels at 3am - back up at 6:30 to head to work :) - I like your style @SlayerLightStorm
[0:28:26] falsenx: 18th pp? what's that?
[0:28:46] SlayerLightStorm: @A_New_Challenger Heh, I don't have to be at work until 11 am
[0:28:56] Verynicepotato: '
[0:29:17] Funderik: what people are forgetting about prepatch, they boost the exp from quests and reduced the exp from 20-60 by 30%

[0:32:50] lukaskar: DAMNNN what was the date?
[0:32:50] DadoMeoow: PepoDance
[0:32:57] Cartharon: this year blizz just loves to spoil the news it seem
[0:33:02] Carahail: I am sooo ready to make my TBC Classic BE Huunter
[0:33:02] Rottencoarse: @lukaskar  1st of june
[0:33:09] Dogewiz: @Towelliee they could be announcing the pp soon saying this leak happened
[0:33:22] rohdey: could be shopped
[0:33:24] geokouts: if you get the disconnected messge on chooseing char you can scan and repair wow
[0:33:37] BRUTALIT0PS: I don't buy it personally
[0:33:38] Dogewiz: @rohdey other people saw this i dont think this is shopped but still a chance
[0:33:46] johnnyyydh: I dont find it strange if they did this on purpose to create hype
[0:33:49] Dirtnose: Seems way to early imo. Old date maybe
[0:33:51] meijer32: in 3 weeks holy shit
[0:34:04] ShadoodHD: too soon, executives!
[0:34:11] Funderik: wowhead has a better post with multi images in different forms
[0:34:23] Thoreya: im gonna say its true lol
[0:34:23] Jermo11: should be prepatch today then if its june 1st launc LUL
[0:34:29] Tigerklaue: i think its a old date they delayed it
[0:34:30] atri3213: SUS!
[0:34:46] juga27: helo
[0:34:48] Rottencoarse: 45 days @Towelliee
[0:35:13] jeziorek: exactly
[0:35:15] Carahail: that's true @Dirtnose  could be a old chosen date
[0:35:35] BRUTALIT0PS: I am still holding out hope for May 11th
[0:35:50] PoppaShot: pre patch today Kappa
[0:36:06] CipansR_Ayaya: then why is its there
[0:36:20] Bulgogiprince: June 1st is a weird date right after memorial day
[0:36:21] Thoreya: 100 monopoly dollars its true
[0:36:23] Dogewiz: @Towelliee blizzard the master of blue balling
[0:36:25] BRUTALIT0PS: People out here toying with our emotions
[0:36:29] theminerr_: I mean, who cares....
[0:36:33] ShadoodHD: wait it does look stupid... who'd want black ops cold war through may 4 Kappa
[0:36:35] Dirtnose: @Sirwallaby A mistake. Considering it was under HOTS banner
[0:36:44] Funderik: they did major tweeks to leveling on prepatch, at least a 30% change pre 60
[0:36:50] CipansR_Ayaya: weird @Dirtnose
[0:37:12] SlayerLightStorm: I'd say it is suspicious @Towelliee

[0:37:17] Bulgogiprince: plenty of IT mistakes haha

[0:37:43] Funderik: the same way they fuck anything up lol some dude straight out of uni. it's been a habit recently... 9.1 3 days before blizcon anyone?
[0:37:48] mmrghost7: jun first confirmed REEEEEEE
[0:37:55] strike879: maybe set as auto update and because nobody plays heroes anymore they forgot to remove it from that launcher
[0:38:09] Chiplol: its june 1, 2022 obv
[0:38:12] Dogewiz: i mean yeah for the last year and a half blizzard is pretty good at leaking things
[0:39:02] BRUTALIT0PS: Those 3 are the main ones I care about anyway
[0:39:02] Kirbza: no need to test sunwell yet
[0:39:05] CaptainChipmunk: what about the improved premade group finder they said at blizzcon?
[0:39:17] pkLeech: better like that - then they can at least focus patch by patch
[0:39:19] CipansR_Ayaya: no
[0:39:19] Bulgogiprince: Leaking is a form of marketing
[0:39:27] Funderik: "leaks"
[0:39:29] Bulgogiprince: free marketing
[0:39:31] Jermo11: doing it on purpose
[0:39:32] Baconbender: @Bulgogiprince my thinking aswell :P
[0:39:33] Tigerklaue: i mean they are all working from home
[0:39:47] xImmortalGodx: how do you feel about the boomie change for 9.1? if they are night fae they pretty much only become convoke if the leggo is usable
[0:39:55] Dogewiz: idk no reason to leak blizcon especially for this last one saying that watching it was free
[0:39:56] ShadoodHD: the cold war promo in that pic is kinda sus though 🤔

[0:40:17] AureliusXV: tear
[0:40:33] Prideth: <3
[0:40:36] Funderik: testing the water to see how people feel, ye i can see that
[0:40:45] Dogewiz: yeah that would make sense
[0:40:50] Dirtnose: could be
[0:41:07] alundrius: makes sense, the hype will continue to drop the longer beta goes on. its a smart biz decision to launch early
[0:41:15] Dogewiz: i mean even with this real or not tbc seems like its in the next 2 months
[0:41:16] Chrissfrosty: morning
[0:41:22] BRUTALIT0PS: I am fucking way behind where I want to be if it is legit June 1st

[0:41:31] die4weasel: i get it all the time
[0:41:32] MuttonChopins: I hope its not just a 2 week pre-patch
[0:41:32] geokouts: Scan and repair WOW
[0:41:33] Kirbza: have you seen the arena changes they're doing for tbc?
[0:41:34] meijer32: gonna have to lvl my dreanei in less then 2 weeks
[0:41:36] cabalish: its a bug
[0:41:38] BRUTALIT0PS: I get it a LOT
[0:41:38] Piees_: assuming these news are queued maybe they queued the news to show for June 1st, but when they had to postpone it they forgot to remove from HOTS queue
[0:41:47] danny_way: we need 6 weeks pre patch
[0:41:55] Dogewiz: yeah and even after getting 60 you need resets and shit for raid gear
[0:42:02] BRUTALIT0PS: Where is Crit at. You gonna need him if it is 2 weeks LUL
[0:42:05] Austei: gotta use those boost
[0:42:16] Tigerklaue: you level 30% faster with pre patch
[0:42:17] Funderik: they change leveling in prepatch, more quests, more exp, less exp needed.
[0:42:26] Cartharon: damn i am gonna lvl a dranei shaman, will be hard two weeks next to work if the new are true :D
[0:42:39] Dogewiz: even after the xp changes gear and raid reset will still be hard

[0:42:42] Dirtnose: gonna level a belf paladin, dont think ill hit 60 if june 1st is the release date but not a big deal to me
[0:42:48] Dogewiz: 2 resets to get gear will be hard
[0:43:15] dartrilas: it took me 11 days for my first ever toon, that would still be lioke 7 or 8 days played
[0:43:33] bhxkazzam1: its basically around 100 hours to level to 60 in 2 weeks..
[0:43:42] bhxkazzam1: way too much
[0:43:45] Funderik: you did say they don't see prepatch a big deal, we'll find out this week hopefully
[0:43:46] Chrissfrosty: morning
[0:43:50] danny_way: my pali will def be on the bench for the foreseeable future if this news is true
[0:43:52] tillix_real: try the paid boost 50euro on belf if it is not forbitten

[0:44:36] PokerFaceMoose: a lot of normies cannot level BE or Draenei in 2 weeks. no way
[0:44:37] sranger04: @towelliee should we expect a prepatch announcement today then?
[0:44:37] SlayerLightStorm: That feels like Sonic '06 kind of rushed.
[0:45:12] BRUTALIT0PS: I don't think I even have enough gold on retail to trade tbh
[0:45:17] BRUTALIT0PS: I would if I could though for sure
[0:45:20] geokouts: @Towelliee If you get the message of disconnected on charachter selection screenyou can scan and repair game on options at launcher of WOW
[0:45:21] Cartharon: maybe they just wanted to have some fun having people panicing
[0:45:28] stcreme: Whats that mission table addon ?
[0:45:31] theminerr_: why do u you need all that info tho???... like come on play the game, is all this stress necessary?? lol @Towelliee
[0:45:32] LecterSRK: i would just like any kind of information at all :)
[0:45:36] Funderik: after the year we've had, getting content early is a blessing :P
[0:45:37] Dogewiz: if that leak is real honestly pre patch will be announced today or some time this week

[0:46:26] stcreme: @Dirtnose thx
[0:47:04] dartrilas: cant wait to see the malding if pre patch is only 2 weeeks, i think it makes perfect sense, because blizzard dont want everyone in hellfire peninsula on day one
[0:47:13] Tekloth: PTR already got an hour-long downtime this morning
[0:47:16] catchjoker: is tbc going to be an expansion you rebuy, or just included with sub?

[0:47:24] Dirtnose: @catchjoker included with sub

[1:01:28] BRUTALIT0PS: I know Panda made a character on the server for sure
[1:01:43] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee i suppose prepatch being short lessens the amount of traffic in the early BC zones.
[1:01:45] BRUTALIT0PS: I watched him do it a few weeks ago, not sure how often he plays it though

[1:03:10] Getitonthelow: so if bc is June 1st when is 9.1?
[1:03:21] BRUTALIT0PS: It is always worth leveling right now. Less you have to do when it releases and more time to get gear to make BC easier
[1:03:22] cordawg: more ads onthis channel ....  :(
[1:03:27] Scarok: Less time to honor gear :\
[1:03:32] raymond3195: mage boosters will be busy in prepatch

[1:04:23] NILLme: queues will be insane
[1:04:26] LecterSRK: a fucked up launch is more memorable than a smooth launch, change my mind
[1:04:43] cesarbee3: love the stream bro.
[1:04:48] BRUTALIT0PS: Thankfully Azuresong isn't packed so hopefully the server will be fine when BC launches
[1:04:53] baraktus: im on westfall alli and hope the server be fine at launch

[1:05:25] bruhSit_farmer: i could barely see anyone in sl launch lol

[1:05:55] BRUTALIT0PS: Classic WoD when?
[1:06:00] Steppie: WoD levelling was great
[1:06:02] Jokervenom1978: Area 52 is super toxic too
[1:06:03] Aaradin: it went down for shadowlands launch too lol area 52
[1:06:07] Motivess: getting stuck at that eyeglass was horrible
[1:06:10] flebbooo: Kazzak eu was down for an hour on SL launch LUL
[1:06:13] alundrius: area 52 has gobbo engineers =D
[1:06:16] 2MakeMe: Furthest away from the vents
[1:06:24] bruhSit_farmer: cursed
[1:06:29] pkLeech: WoD leveling still the fastest
[1:06:44] SlayerLightStorm: A52's worse than a woman.
[1:06:54] Wedgeh: towZap
[1:06:58] r0b0tak0s: KEKW
[1:07:05] grapyz: Just that one guy in the corner working alone with A52
[1:07:08] ArcaneSyntax: A52 is bad because it's the server i play on.
[1:07:29] BRUTALIT0PS: Wedgeh I need you to kill things for me and let me skin them all. K thanks

[1:17:36] gryn: thats honestly why I stopped playing classic. world buffs.
[1:17:45] eatonaround: yes
[1:17:53] BRUTALIT0PS: I mean most racials are meaningless, but Troll and Orc for dps
[1:17:57] RyzuxTV: I'm trying to find a fun class to "casually" play Classic. Was leveling a Hunter, but someone told me they're bad at end-game stuff. Any help chat?
[1:18:04] ArcaneSyntax: blood fury is gonna be nuts for shamans.
[1:18:14] BRUTALIT0PS: Hunters are not bad at end game. Who the hell told you that?!
[1:18:20] twanlol: hunter gonna be insane in tbc

[1:19:09] Specsifier: I like marks in TBC personally
[1:19:11] Cooby4Z: ret paly isnt "good" but its also not shit like classic
[1:19:13] plumpus81: hunter is literally a one button macro
[1:19:16] BRUTALIT0PS: Flying is at 68 or 70 I don't remember
[1:19:18] BRUTALIT0PS: I think
[1:19:21] Oriion_: Ive rolled away from hunter for that reason.
[1:19:26] Averegeguy: Shaman is so good in BC
[1:19:27] BRUTALIT0PS: I could be wrong, I don't really remember tbh
[1:19:28] Artivicii: ret pally only good with enh shammy group
[1:19:30] ArcaneSyntax: the ele shaman rotation is just lightning bolt lmao

[1:19:45] Motivess: oh, no kidding, so it was 60 in Wrath
[1:19:50] RyzuxTV: So, most of the alliance players are going to switch to horde in TBC?
[1:19:57] CipansR_Ayaya: catJAM
[1:20:05] Artivicii: 3 is good enough
[1:20:06] slizard93: sham with lw drums Kreygasm
[1:20:09] Volwrath: Would you say that applies to enhance as well?
[1:20:11] Artivicii: 4 is probably optimal tho
[1:20:13] techdough: Where's shadow priest within that spectrum?
[1:20:15] 2MakeMe: @brutalit0ps 70
[1:20:22] ArcaneSyntax: @volwrath yes
[1:20:24] Artivicii: @magustone high demand
[1:20:27] JPCloud28TV: Whatever happened to your old hardcore guild on Retail?
[1:20:36] techdough: Boomkin?
[1:20:39] Artivicii: @magustone everyone wants a spriest or two in their raids
[1:20:40] BRUTALIT0PS: Yeah, I thought so. Was going off of memory though and I am getting older. Memory is not always reliable at my age LUL
[1:20:45] Osskssa: @magustone dps high support

[1:21:25] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Psomolethra (warning)
[1:21:32] Wildside1177: A lot of the class differences are being hugely over exaggerated too. It is not like BM hunters do 50% more damage - but they are very good.

[1:23:33] LecterSRK: i dont know if im lucky with my server but since day one, people were really open minded in classic when it comes to classes. on EU that is
[1:23:37] Wildside1177: Within a few months the population will be low enough that raid leaders will just be happy to have competant people.
[1:23:51] ceebz: TBC TBC TBC TBC!!!!!!!
[1:23:57] lich1222: prot have crusader strike ;0/
[1:23:59] Artivicii: thats true
[1:24:09] BTiZZY_: morning chat btizzyHi

[1:24:22] Vexxsis: rng on malch in kara
[1:24:36] ceebz: think we will only get 2 weeks of pre-patch?
[1:25:35] Shy0ne: ;)
[1:26:51] dontbecold: PVP in TBC
[1:26:55] Th3IceCr3amMan: june 1st would be a giant fuck you to the face honestly
[1:27:02] Nico_vdM: The questgiver can solo this lich, but no they have to send a random adventurer to fetch the phylactery
[1:27:05] Specsifier: I'm still only level 24, but I do want to get into classic. its just so time consuming.
[1:27:12] Artivicii: yah arena finna be lit
[1:27:16] Volwrath: There's no way BC comes out on June 1st is it?
[1:27:18] LecterSRK: @Th3IceCr3amMan youre exaggerating i hope
[1:27:20] RyzuxTV: Is the leveling process easier in TBC than Classic? Like, 1-60
[1:27:24] Beefloaf: NTBackup subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! good morning everyone
[1:27:26] Artivicii: lit with RMP EleGiggle
[1:27:29] 2MakeMe: And the 1-60 lvling nerf
[1:27:37] LecterSRK: @RyzuxGaming about 30% faster yes
[1:27:38] fewyn: all i remember about TBC arenas was playing a hunter and spamming steady shot
[1:27:57] RyzuxTV: @LecterSRK But will that take effect from the pre-patch or once TBC drops?
[1:28:08] Artivicii: hunter/warlock/rdruid was cancer AF
[1:28:09] BRUTALIT0PS: Should go into effect on prepatch
[1:28:21] LecterSRK: @RyzuxGaming im not sure, i would hope for it to be from prepatch on
[1:28:26] RyzuxTV: Awesome! Thanks for answering ^.^
[1:28:36] 2MakeMe: And right click
[1:28:39] Th3IceCr3amMan: @LecterSRK the fact they cant communicate with their playerbase for a big release like that is shitty. Was planning to level a pally with my brother and we wont have time at all.
[1:29:17] LecterSRK: @Th3IceCr3amMan i agree, its far from optimal how theyre handling everything so far. i would like any kind of reliable intel as well

[1:42:26] Sollice: Your streaming PC's should have as many cores as you can do you can process slower speeds. Cores/Threads are best for that

[1:43:03] Sollice: Dual PCs rather.
[1:43:43] jerseyfive: 100$ cpu is enough for h264 stream
[1:43:57] Mallaes: luxthoSus
[1:44:26] Sollice: @jerseyfive If you want to run at super fast or ultra fast presets
[1:44:27] Kinghorn: where are your sources at
[1:44:28] Nico_vdM: People still need time to level their goats and belves during pre patch
[1:44:35] Dirtnose: @ptz117 no one knows for sure
[1:44:54] Dirtnose: although id assume before but idk
[1:45:34] Sollice: So how does this land for 9.1? So at this point is it obvious 9.1 will be after TBC. Question is how much longer? 1 month?
[1:45:46] Artivicii: 2 weeks EleGiggle good luck
[1:46:06] NILLme: mage boosters will be busy :D
[1:46:15] Sollice: So 9.1 in July? late July perhaps?
[1:46:23] FranciscoTheMage: wait @Towelliee what the heck is this bar at the top. is that a new version of that leveling and ap circle
[1:46:37] FranciscoTheMage: is it a standalone add-on?
[1:46:44] Xarith: But if pre patch is 18th of May and the pre patch is going to be short. Wont the release be 8th or 15h of june?
[1:46:56] anxietyrising: So Blizz won't be able to counter New World or Endwalker (FF14xpac) like they usually do?

[1:47:09] Nico_vdM: "If you don’t have characters ready for the journey beyond the Dark Portal and are interested in adventuring in Outland with your friends, we will offer an optional Level-58 Character Boost service closer to the launch of Burning Crusade Classic."  I dont think boosts will be available on day one of pre-patch
[1:47:18] BRUTALIT0PS: Or Luxthos xp bar
[1:47:57] Mallaes: Kreygasm
[1:47:58] FranciscoTheMage: People seem to think streamers are what is progress in a game. its not reality the majority of gamers dont play games for a living 24 x7
[1:48:08] bob_the_demon: @anxietyrising New World comes out 8/1 so a late july release of 9,1 makes sense

[2:08:32] Volwrath: I can't see it being that short
[2:08:36] Jawis: I hope they decide to give us 3 weeks for the pre patch, if that june 1st is the right date
[2:09:10] Tekloth: 2 weeks is plenty of time to get your new spacegoats/wannabe-elves to 60 though, especially with the xp-changes and the boosting meta

[2:09:34] 2MakeMe: well with all the boosting, you probably could hit 60
[2:09:40] Jawis: boosting gets hit though
[2:09:42] Mitchendo64: FeelsBadMan for the casual pvpers who just wanted to get pvp gear in TBC
[2:09:48] Aktz_: TrUe
[2:09:49] Jawis: not dead after the patch but probably even more expensive
[2:10:05] ELgnad: !origin
[2:10:08] Jawis: bless you
[2:10:16] Mathez: @Towelliee the thing is, shammans and palas get boosted after like 4 days right now via dungeons
[2:10:17] JmzKarma: i think if they only give two weeks people will die because they wont sleep trying to get max before launch

[2:11:12] Gizimoo86: people will hit 60 in one week, leveling is way faster
[2:11:13] ajax2323: will the lvl58 boost come with prepatch or release
[2:11:14] Folkja: isnt it 30% less xp required? could be doable
[2:11:26] da_moosse: I can't wait to get my new pc from origin
[2:11:35] ELgnad: !origin
[2:11:41] Shallo1988: in og tbc pre patch were BE and Dranei accessible
[2:11:46] NovaSun84: remember that prepatch changes the Mage AoE abilities eh
[2:11:59] NILLme: Activision Blizzard investors call is today :D
[2:12:00] ajax2323: if it came with prepatch it gives something to do for the retail players switching
[2:12:02] Nertok12: 5-6 days to 60 with boosting or less 7-8 days with questing duo
[2:12:05] dazzarno: no Draenei and BE were not available in original Prepatch
[2:12:05] Jawis: which would make sense, 2 weeks ahead of the TBC launch = "soon before" pepeD
[2:12:09] chloef0x: it should mean that but you know how blizz is
[2:12:12] feherlofia123: @shallo1988 no
[2:12:12] NovaSun84: they probably won't be running as quickly as they are now

[2:13:55] E5Mz: im not playing retail anymore, like 1 month ago
[2:14:21] Th3IceCr3amMan: If theyre releasing tbc just to get subs that'd suck. Classic isnt a second hand game that's there to support retail. It's it's own game
[2:14:22] CipansR_Ayaya: wow

[2:15:45] Th3IceCr3amMan: i meant release tbc early
[2:16:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: mythic plus isnt fun to me so I have 0 valor
[2:16:06] Tekloth: Classic is 100% for profit and used as a fish hook to get people who romanticize vanilla/tbc subbed back, no question about it

[2:22:44] littlehelle: Is there a release date for pre patch ?

[2:22:55] chloef0x: if cuban wants to make me a millionaire im cool with it
[2:23:08] PokerFaceMoose: well they "predict" that because they have 40million invested in it and want to use their influence to make a profit
[2:23:16] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee I like Mark's take, he looks at doge as a future currency rather than bitcoin gold which gives doge a good place.

[2:31:36] OceanManCarter: I remember when all of Cataclysm was leaked on mmo-champ
[2:31:45] michaelmm: Didn't they accidentally leak Wrath?
[2:31:45] NILLme: they are hiring so many new people because the veterans are leaving, im not surprised
[2:31:50] RagingPunk: yea def sus
[2:31:59] SmokedHog: it creates hype
[2:32:02] Blackplaguee: They leaking this shit to stay Current?
[2:32:07] Nasilvera: @alexfdez17 Could just be a two week prepatch
[2:32:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: leaks are free advertising
[2:32:25] Barralgul: Marvel now does the same with tom holland "leaks"
[2:32:29] 클라우센: ^ they are killing my hype
[2:32:31] TheRiwen: You all have fun in wow :) i lave left and found another place
[2:32:34] NovaSun84: It would be kinda sad that we as humans pay attention to "Leaks" instead of active "PR"... but I wouldn't put it past Blizz Marketting to label it as "leaks"
[2:32:35] coldhandsbeatz: 2 weeks seems very short for blood elves and draenei to hit 60..
[2:32:43] Murlock07: Legion t-shirt leak
[2:32:46] Teldrin89: just heard from friend of a friend that he had it on his launcher under hots so it might seem to be legit
[2:32:58] Volwrath: Those leaks generate a lot of discussions/debates/hype so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case
[2:32:58] NinjaGlovz: true
[2:33:01] Thoreya: Definitely did
[2:33:07] Thoreya: I think it did a lot for pvp
[2:33:11] NovaSun84: the beta key give-aways was what killed it for me
[2:33:12] Artivicii: yup true
[2:33:18] JmzKarma: yep
[2:33:18] Artivicii: that was a weird decision tbh
[2:33:33] coldhandsbeatz: Seeing the bugs reported and fixes thanks to Beta I dont care about if it killed the hype
[2:33:33] Blackplaguee: I beta tested the origin beta for TBC and don't wana grind beta then the game.
[2:33:35] batsun1corn: i think wotlk classic might not happen tbh
[2:33:42] sinlesssinner: they have 9.1 coming bro, they gotta get rid of TBC quick @Towelliee
[2:33:42] constantinfive: this things ppl can playem on privetservers so i do no
[2:33:50] coldhandsbeatz: If only Blizzard hired actual QA testers so those kinds of betas are not even needed
[2:33:59] wreckedgum: late to the stream, what is your take on June 1st Mr towellie? surely its way too soon??
[2:34:02] TheRiwen: 9.1 will fail hard i think
[2:34:10] chloef0x: lol and 9.1 is going to blow
[2:34:24] grylz89: all the streamers are really hyping tbc arena tho
[2:34:36] aevd: you should tyr's hand tap level til 60, its 45min-1hr levels
[2:34:46] sinlesssinner: yes, they have to give a breather between the two, i know it aint coming soon, but june for TBC, and late July for 9.1, we are in agreement :)
[2:34:48] Simajz: July ? It will be so dead game until july
[2:34:52] indiana__cones: I honestly can't understand why people would choose to still play classic when TBC is released. Especially those who have cleared Nax so many times now
[2:34:54] grylz89: tbc is gonna kill shadow lands unfortunately
[2:35:05] Wh1rly: they are going to kill there game by not releasing content
[2:35:14] grylz89: tru
[2:35:17] Wh1rly: everyone seems to have quit already
[2:35:25] Thoreya: Just like classic killed shadowlands 😂
[2:35:29] wreckedgum: @grylz89 i dunno.. I think after a while people will get bored of the TBC arena. itll start massive and then get a bit boring fast (1/2 months)
[2:35:35] Wildside1177: 99%
[2:35:36] Thoreya: Barely any streamers are even playing the beta compared to classic
[2:35:36] NovaSun84: plus PvP straemers have proven exactly what metas work
[2:35:38] Redpandalol: when sl/sl warlock and clothwearing resto druids in 2s
[2:35:39] Artivicii: everything but rmp
[2:35:47] chloef0x: classic didnt kill shadowlands, shadowlands is slowly killing shadowlands
[2:35:58] GoodGuy_Oxid: Its hard to have classic kill shadowlands when blizz don't care about classic enough to ban botters. So prom what i know, its just lack of cleanup

[3:13:10] DreamIV: It definitely is. I had a buddy come back to wow who hasn’t played since MOP and was like wtf 😂
[3:13:16] da_moosse: went through torghast yesterday and after spending 2 hours in there forgot to buy a quest item from the vendor
[3:13:19] GoKu1g: I've not tried PTR Torghast, its on my list of things to do today
[3:13:19] inj0shwetrust: I wish it was a bit more rewarding
[3:13:21] gategangster44: Gimmie a key
[3:13:22] CaptainJoeyNY: how do I know what my nickname is on the discord?
[3:13:31] Sollice: You know....9.1 Torghast could give us chests that have pots, gems, reagents etc in it and it would be better than nothing
[3:13:34] leogaming83: Good morning
[3:13:37] Exodeo_: Sure i'll give you a key Kappa

[3:13:46] NateGetty: Hows it going this morning my man
[3:13:46] Sollice: So many things Blizzard could give us as a reward. I don't know why they are struggling with it
[3:13:48] PadidinJones: I would not have my kid play WoW at such an early age. High school first yo
[3:13:48] RogueBear: liking it more and liking it are two different things
[3:13:54] PadidinJones: Realm list is up
[3:13:54] Feldecay: What’s up
[3:13:54] GoKu1g: @Sollice wouldnt be such a "chore" then init lol!
[3:13:55] Davediggity25: it just needs to have better rewards is all and people will like Torghast more
[3:14:00] Erielle04: Pogggg
[3:14:03] neverbornlucky: Just treat Targhast like eating their veggies. 1 hour of play in Targhast - to 5 hours of minecraft play
[3:14:04] raymond3195: we monk slaps in torghast with corrosive
[3:14:09] SlayerLightStorm: Just making sure I'm here. Giveaway going on, you know?

[3:15:26] GoKu1g: pog!
[3:15:26] fewyn: that's actually huge
[3:15:28] CipansR_Ayaya: Idk I did visions more and BFA didnt made me quit, its weird
[3:15:42] JmzKarma: nice i still havent got that yet, only hit 60 yesterday
[3:15:50] Indy_VT: That would make torghast  way more bearable
[3:15:52] dracullus: he does that often doesn't he
[3:15:53] Sollice: Yeah but @Towelliee they could have made it cooler. Spend your knowledge to auto loot phantasma. But give us like a Diablo 3 style loot goblin that does it for us and runs around with us.
[3:16:02] Sollice: Something small that could make it a bit more "fun"

[3:16:26] Kuukenstein: you have probably talked about this a bit but just came in. what do you think about this June 1st TBC or was it photoshopped?
[3:16:30] mavericks312: now if theybadd some rewards torghast maybe redeemed
[3:16:30] Davediggity25: problem is you have to run Torghast so many times before you get those benefits
[3:16:49] Kinghorn: cobaltMald
[3:16:51] CaptainJoeyNY: Id literally just play toghast 50-60
[3:16:52] pseudo75: that would be PogChamp
[3:16:56] Davediggity25: and once you get those benefits there is no more need to run it

[3:17:40] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee  has blizzard mentioned anything about stygia still being used for sockets in 9.1? Really don't wanna farm it unless I have to lol
[3:17:46] Davediggity25: i guess i missed the rewards
[3:17:50] GoKu1g: @xrandomdoodx theres no sockets in 9.1
[3:18:03] Sollice: @xrandomdoodx I thought they said Stygia was going away in 9.1
[3:18:09] Kinghorn: gottem
[3:18:10] xrandomdoodx: ooo didnt know that
[3:18:10] coldhandsbeatz: I heard Bellular yesterday put it so simple. “Just let players do as high as they can with scaling and give gear with an appropiated ilvl as reward” it felt so simple and Torghast would be so much better tbh.
[3:18:10] CipansR_Ayaya: KEKW
[3:18:13] dracullus: they could even throw whole islands rewards as random drops if you ask me
[3:18:15] Exodeo_: But blizzard want to keep us playing more with us having to farm gear more Kappa
[3:18:17] pokerigo: KEKW
[3:18:18] xrandomdoodx: ty
[3:18:20] Sollice: I think its going away. Someone can correct me if I am wrong
[3:18:22] Kuukenstein: you have probably talked about this a bit but just came in. what do you think about this June 1st TBC or was it photoshopped?
[3:18:22] mavericks312: get good the meme of 2021 for blizzard
[3:18:37] CaptainJoeyNY: @alexfdez17 thats what it seemed torghast was gunna be before we got to actually play it at all
[3:18:40] hausofalts: What up Hammer squad?
[3:18:44] Cntrl11120: did the US servers reset?
[3:18:46] Yagr6: people still play retail? y
[3:18:49] TheVigiliance: It's a skill issue
[3:18:52] Sollice: Server is down yes. Reset at 11
[3:18:58] RogueBear: Frankly thats a skill issue Kappa
[3:18:59] Sollice: so reset in 47 minutes
[3:19:02] coldhandsbeatz: @captainjoeyny at that point it clicked for me. I was like “this would be so good to play” lol
[3:19:06] Cntrl11120: thanks @Sollice
[3:19:11] leogaming83: yeah servers are down
[3:19:25] justthomxs: frankly thats a skill issue is the new you think you do but you dont
[3:19:27] Verynicepotato: '
[3:19:30] remitis: is this eu?
[3:19:34] CaptainJoeyNY: Roguelike content, it should just keep going
[3:19:51] SlayerLightStorm: Inb4 everyone mass unsubs, hurting Blizzard's profits.
[3:19:53] Reaghol: classic up @Towelliee
[3:19:53] ArcaneSyntax: the the game becomes enter torghast and never leave
[3:19:55] Nalleys: Classic servers back up
[3:19:58] dracullus: and even 6 was too much if they reduce it to 5
[3:20:05] coldhandsbeatz: I think it would work as side thing for gearing. The point is that 6 floors is too low. Maybe cap it at 30 or so
[3:20:08] Samurai3434: If it was only two floors people would still complain
[3:20:13] Hyrja: in 9.1 its 5 floor :D
[3:20:13] Th3IceCr3amMan: i think they'll improve it with future patches/expansions
[3:20:13] Cntrl11120: 10 floors, 5 has a mini boss tougher then the floor bosses but lesser then the final boss
[3:20:23] Angerina: it works in FFXIV though
[3:20:33] Sollice: Dont start dumb rumors
[3:20:43] tbbex_: Torghast is something I avoid at most costs
[3:20:46] mavericks312: but we all complained about to much loot in the previous xpacs lmao
[3:20:47] cruzeal: all kinds of loot
[3:20:49] CaptainJoeyNY: There needs to be a gear cap for content based on number of players, and difficutly. if you can farm Mythics for 5 weeks and get top tier gear, why cant you farm mythic torghast?
[3:20:51] GoKu1g: I'd be happy if they tied TRANSMOG sets into Twisting Corridors! much like mage tower, that would make it SOO much better!!
[3:21:02] Yagr6: i wish we had more ways to modify our loot
[3:21:03] hawee11: Yo
[3:21:06] JmzKarma: retail is a collect it all sim.. GIVE US ALL THE LOOT
[3:21:10] da_moosse: are they planning on adding things like transmog items as loot for torghast?
[3:21:19] Sollice: @ogmoosse Not that we have heard so far
[3:21:20] grapyz: please dont add affixes in torghast
[3:21:20] coldhandsbeatz: Make torghast the twisting corridords length at least at reward loot. That would be way better
[3:21:30] CipansR_Ayaya: raid finder torghast Pog
[3:21:33] Cntrl11120: yoooo monk corrosive dosages mythic torghaust OP runs
[3:21:35] CaptainJoeyNY: It just add options to get the best loot.

[3:22:08] mavericks312: I just want my legion legacy damage
[3:22:10] CipansR_Ayaya: KEKW
[3:22:11] fewyn: i am so behind on my 9.1 news
[3:22:22] neverbornlucky: I guess loot boost would be the death of the game no matter how much you paid
[3:22:26] PoppaShot: imagine BFA update being best news about shadowlands @Towelliee  KEKW
[3:22:27] hawee11: I’m on mobile can’t clicky
[3:22:28] PvtHudson093: Some guy was whining on reddit that he needed to do pvp for the extra 3 slots or it holds his gearing process back
[3:22:38] nightmayor12: Mythic pet battles would be POG
[3:22:38] Cntrl11120: it is in ?
[3:22:46] Exodeo_: I'd love to solo farm legion
[3:22:47] SirBeetus: I'm at work trying to win a key. anything specific I have to do in chat to enter? already entered on discord
[3:22:55] DreamIV: I think blizzard holds off from the community getting more loot in order keep us playing the game longer personally
[3:22:56] PvtHudson093: I really want to do Legion tmogs but i cant
[3:22:56] Cntrl11120: Legion has legacy damage already its just overtuned on bosses
[3:22:58] Bahamut145: <--- thats me

[3:23:35] Sollice: No one playing in SL is looking for Legion content to be hard....We only want to do it for loot and transmog
[3:23:42] Yozomiko: i hope we get some 9.1 raid testing this week
[3:23:43] oldmangamer0: Yea your right
[3:23:44] Exodeo_: Farming Legion tmog would be great during the drought we have too
[3:23:47] JmzKarma: LEGIT.. dd ToS today and had to do all mechanics on the fucking bosses for a mog run
[3:23:51] Templexx: the disconnect :(
[3:23:51] Sollice: For him to say that again points out...He is really out of touch.
[3:24:03] GoKu1g: the Dragon has a mount
[3:24:08] DestroyerDa007: All of them drop the same one dont they?
[3:24:18] NovaSun84: Legacy drops max what 200 ilvl gear too?
[3:24:18] cabalish: once a day
[3:24:23] tkzod: the question is why does Blizzard hesitate to just make it legacy?
[3:24:24] thiccsushi: @Sollice He really only just raidlogs he's out of touch with a lot of things
[3:24:31] reyvin40: i still can't clear mythic nighthold.  Maybe i'm just not good enough
[3:24:34] Jakosin: yeah i got on classic hell yeah.
[3:24:36] Cntrl11120: ALL of them drop a hound mount BUT the one on taurus drops a specific different mount
[3:24:38] Hellizzy: These arena bosses have better abilities than the ones in Torghast

[3:24:51] Sollice: He probably isn't, but Ion really should be on the hot seat. If he doesn't pull something big off here by the end of SL I think it is time for Blizzard to move on
[3:25:08] dehash1: its clear he doesnt care about folks who do transmog/mount farms
[3:25:11] smashwow: that "we have the data" comment is getting kinda old. they rarely state facts after that, showing they really have the data on that talking point.
[3:25:24] SlayerLightStorm: @hawee11 You've been following since Nov of 2016. HAPPY?
[3:25:25] Sollice: They all may need to be on the hot seat. Get rid of all of them
[3:25:28] CipansR_Ayaya: Prob
[3:25:49] BRUTALIT0PS: I don't think Ion is the issue. It's higher ups
[3:25:56] forcegamerrr: Oh yeah 100%. There's no way he has the final say.
[3:26:00] hawee11: Yes ty that’s sucks it don’t show my origanal follow I’ve accidental unfollowed before
[3:26:02] Erielle04: i agree
[3:26:05] SpoonManes: retail is up
[3:26:09] sifer007: the guy at blixxconn
[3:26:10] justlnquisitive: Also, be careful what you wish for. You could end up with someone even worse at the helm.
[3:26:10] NILLme: ofc, there are people above him
[3:26:11] Masqerader: need that grind time play metric
[3:26:14] PvtHudson093: I think they shouldnt take stuff away then give it back later and expect us to praise them for doing something that they shouldnt have in the first place
[3:26:14] CipansR_Ayaya: yeah hes just one person
[3:26:15] PadidinJones: Servers are up!
[3:26:22] Yagr6: TheIlluminati HIGHER UPS
[3:26:25] Vyntage1: @smashwow they do have data... much, much more than the community...
[3:26:33] ChiefMango: I mean, if he's not allowed to change it, he gotta find any reason for it to be "OK" no matter how out of touch it seems
[3:26:34] SpoonManes: killuminati
[3:26:40] CritcobainTV: SERVERS UP
[3:26:41] Sollice: Then if they are all of touch, get rid of all of them. Activision probably doesn't want to do that though because that management team is all touting the player engagement philosophy
[3:26:46] DrSoosh: @towelliee i guarantee every time he proposes a change the board asks will decrease time played? and if he says yes, nothing else matters.
[3:26:47] CaptainJoeyNY: Classic is back up
[3:26:48] sifer007: people blame ion for everything
[3:26:54] DrakhanGaming: account wide soul ash would be nice
[3:27:06] daddy_dolby: Seems like Blizzard is limiting the Creative Freedom in their company and its causing issues. Issues with their products and issues with trying to keep good talent around.
[3:27:23] Sollice: @combopoi He is the face of WoW. That's what happens. If he doesn't want to be the face...then he doesn't have to be he can leave
[3:27:31] hooliggan: @Towelliee I know it isn't anything to you but my guild finally got AoTC last night
[3:27:35] Masqerader: still 9/10
[3:27:37] Wheeellz: sire doesnt need nerfed
[3:27:42] RavenmourneTM: Luxthos WAs 👀 nice
[3:27:44] dracullus: we know Ion raid and Feasel definetely collect mounts
[3:27:46] Vyntage1: its hilarious when the community says "blizz is out of touch" when the community has zero data. Stop using your "feelings" as data, your feelings mean nothing from a big picture perspective.
[3:27:50] PvtHudson093: tier sets should never have been removed
[3:27:57] daddy_dolby: agreed
[3:27:59] SpoonManes: i think blizzard is more gatekeeping now than previous times. they dont want to let the whole cat out of the bag, only bringing pieces out at a time, also due to work-from-home
[3:27:59] SlayerLightStorm: Yeah, Blizzard should've broken the merger with Activision. Let 'em die.
[3:28:02] Clawanorder: But its achievable right? theres plenty of guilds t hat have done it.
[3:28:04] smashwow: @Vyntage1 they should. but they rarely quantify it with numbers. even some of their decisions are suspect if they're data driven.
[3:28:06] Molegarr: SLG got nerfed
[3:28:17] JasperXtreme: you talking about heroic difficulty? or mythic?
[3:28:17] thiccsushi: What are you talking about us saying things as feelings when they keep putting in half asses systems that dont make sense then fully add it in a patch or two later?
[3:28:39] Vyntage1: @smashwow with no data, how can you challenge the data? The community should be asking for said data, not immediately trying to refute it.
[3:28:47] Sollice: @Vyntage1 Uhh what? Class sets...Who said they wanted them gone.. The current loot issues....who complained about this to make it change as much as it has
[3:28:57] TheVigiliance: Please get me out of SLG prison blizz!
[3:29:12] RavenmourneTM: same tbh
[3:29:13] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee

[3:29:22] grapyz: SLg is actually a fun fight IMO though
[3:29:24] Hyrja: sanctum wont be out for 4 months anyway
[3:29:31] grapyz: makes you pay attention at all time

[3:47:24] JMoney_1331: oh damn
[3:47:39] NovaSun84: boofs
[3:47:48] Biorrwolf: The biggest reason why I'm excited is that the lead developer spoke about Blizzard in a respectable manner, making it clear that they're in no way aiming to compete with WoW

[3:52:55] dalaraz: imagine each wow zone on illidan being a node,ravendreth maldraxxus bastion anderweald etc @Towelliee

[3:55:36] PokerFaceMoose: you choose what gate you spawn at when you buiild a character i believe
[3:55:38] DABZ16: nodes lvl up as people do things around it so just where everyone in the server decides to spend their time

[3:57:28] kokochris: @Biorrwolf ah its ok my man.  It was an amazing time, but I'm looking back with rose colored glasses.   The worlds at that time seemed much larger today, since there was no riding or flying.  You had to run/walk everywhere.   I remember nights, planning where I was gonna run from and which town I wanted to visit.  You had to plan it, and make sure you had gear so you didn't get killed running there
[3:57:29] Masqerader: well they lagged the servers out, not that hard

[4:30:04] DrakhanGaming: how much soul ash is a rank 4 off the bat
[4:30:06] MisterBongwater: Yeah I have trouble with those 3 buttons further up because I claw grip instead of palming it
[4:30:19] Sollice: g600 was great when I used it years agop
[4:30:33] Aro725: 210 to 225 is 1200
[4:30:50] Sollice: I have tiny baby hands though so all of those side mouse buttons didn't help
[4:31:02] Vexxsis: imagine playing a mmo on the old school nintendo glove
[4:31:19] jason_shade: mmo mouse made for people who palm grip idk
[4:31:23] Havoc_S1: How do you get the dragon spirit looking thing for night fae

[4:31:41] Broseidon_91: I can't stand Razer Nagas.. I went through 3 mice in less than a year.. The left click goes out and double clicks and the buttons stopped working.. I finally switched to the Logitech MMO mouse
[4:31:58] Sollice: @Ermac87 I was using a Model 0- when I was playing Destiny
[4:32:03] Aro725: how much ash do you have?
[4:32:05] Vexxsis: lol
[4:32:17] BRUTALIT0PS: I use the Corsair version of a naga and I like it
[4:32:20] Vexxsis: bet he throws them
[4:32:22] Aro725: youll get 1140 for both wings, i think you have 50? if so 10 soul ash would be a suck
[4:32:25] DrakhanGaming: the beginning of wow expansions ruin my buttons on my naga lol
[4:32:26] Aro725: oh so you spot on
[4:32:33] MisterBongwater: Sometimes you dps HARD
[4:32:46] BruceRain: @Broseidon_91 my trinity had to be replaced 3 weeks in cuz right click went out. now my new one they sent me is intermittent with the side buttons. have to detach and attach side piece to get it working again
[4:32:46] Gerthil: I ass well did have problems with Razer nagas not that fast but buttons would go out or something like that.
[4:32:52] Finesty: Have had the same Razer Naga since Cata, and still playing pretty solid!
[4:33:06] Broseidon_91: I play a lot of POE and D3, but i've had this Logitech mouse for almost a year and haven't had any issues that i've had with the Razer Naga
[4:33:19] jkitchin75: just the tip
[4:33:20] Havoc_S1: My naga has been loosing tracking and won’t move it did that to me in siege a bunch of times.. the panic mode was real
[4:33:25] domnero: monkaW
[4:33:29] Vexxsis: if your finger isnt numb your not maxing out dps
[4:33:39] Broseidon_91: @BruceRain That's what I was having issues with. I had to keep removing the side panel to get the buttons to work

[4:42:55] dalaraz: 2 months lol
[4:42:59] Sneekzx: @Vexxsis There's no content left to do in Classic unless you want to run the same raids that offer us nothing since the gear will be obsolete soon..
[4:43:01] Finesty: who gives a damn about enough time to level. Throw in the content for something to do
[4:43:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: i could level a blood elf paladin in 2 weeks easy
[4:43:15] dalaraz: 2 months to level
[4:43:17] Sneekzx: With the exception of Naxx/AQ40
[4:43:17] maccaruso: The stated intent of releasing BE/Draenei early was to give players time to be able to start TBC with friends.
[4:43:21] DrakhanGaming: how many hours does it take to level to 60 from 1
[4:43:24] Vexxsis: @lilrogueTV wasnt talking about classic
[4:43:27] DrakhanGaming: on average just questing
[4:43:33] Relyt97: I mean if you go super hard 3 weeks is more then enough time even at 6 hours a day
[4:43:33] swordart_19: Classic you afk a lot to get gear .

[4:43:53] dalaraz: @DrakhanGaming 170 more or less before prepatch,goes down if the xp buff works
[4:43:53] Vexxsis: just meant in general
[4:43:53] smashwow: i'm pretty sure they did say something like that in the round table no?
[4:44:07] neverbornlucky: EQUIPMENT  boost button in shop yet?
[4:44:10] Kinghorn: 4-8 weeks LUL
[4:44:11] maccaruso: The PvP change was HUGE for some classes.
[4:44:12] Hyrja: prepatch is 2 weeks
[4:44:13] JerBoody: @drakhangaming Like 150 hours of /played
[4:44:13] Sollice: 2 months for PRE PATCH LOLOLLOLOLOL
[4:44:20] dracullus: let's make it 60 weeks, one week for one level
[4:44:25] Vexxsis: @lilrogueTV but i get what your saying
[4:44:45] RhadigarTV: Pre patch in 2 weeks on May 18th, TBC launch on June 1st
[4:44:48] swordart_19: big jump xD
[4:44:49] dalaraz: more than 4 weeks for prepatch would be insane anyway
[4:44:59] coldhandsbeatz: Announcement today at least?
[4:45:00] Vexxsis: theres no way 2 month pp
[4:45:01] D3m0nHunt3r666: leaked
[4:45:03] RhadigarTV: That's PLENTY of time
[4:45:03] D3m0nHunt3r666: Kappa
[4:45:04] Justarandomman: They still need test sunwell etc on beta no?
[4:45:07] DrakhanGaming: so if it take 150 hours /played to hit 60 and prepatch is 14 days long just play 11 hours everyday and youll be set
[4:45:23] Vexxsis: maybe PP is june 1st?
[4:45:24] dalaraz: seriously if someone wants to level up,somebody must inform em that you can level up already
[4:45:26] Lamp680: @Justarandomman no that would be PTR nearing that phases release.
[4:45:26] Kinghorn: I want TBC ASAP
[4:45:30] Kinghorn: tomorrow is fine
[4:45:35] D3m0nHunt3r666: ^^^
[4:45:41] Sneekzx: @Vexxsis Yeah, we're all bored in Classic lol thankfully I have retail to dabble in
[4:45:44] maccaruso: Too Soon Executus!
[4:45:46] coldhandsbeatz: They should drop prepatch tomorrow
[4:45:47] oldmangamer0: I was TBC ASAP too
[4:45:53] Sollice: I guess its better than TBC come sooner than later. The later TBC comes out the later 9.1 comes out
[4:45:56] Lamp680: Not in S1
[4:45:58] Uglyfoot: you didnt have to win to get gear
[4:46:01] Xarith: not for s1 and 2
[4:46:02] maccaruso: Not for S1 or S2
[4:46:04] dotsntrees: @Towelliee you need to keep the rating to wear the gear now
[4:46:07] BRUTALIT0PS: I was hoping for 3-4 week prepatch to have time to level, but really I just want BC, idc when
[4:46:08] Vexxsis: @lilrogueTV i been catching up on proffs in classic , and most my time is in FF14 atm
[4:46:10] Justarandomman: You started at 1500, and once you hit rating you got a item, the most prestigious being shoulders (most rare)
[4:46:11] smashwow: prepatch comes with the xp change correct?
[4:46:14] Sielu11628: They just updated the post
[4:46:15] dracullus: who the hell know what they want at this point
[4:46:19] coldhandsbeatz: Yes @smashwow
[4:46:21] swordart_19: LULW
[4:46:22] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[4:46:24] swordart_19: SO TRUE LULW
[4:46:37] SilkeySmooth: jthey are mad rating is required to equipt it you lose rating you can't reequipt it
[4:46:38] Holysal: yeah it wasnt until season 3 when they made it rating
[4:46:41] Sneekzx: @Vexxsis Been doing the same, lvling profs for TBC great time to get tedious chores done
[4:46:51] NILLme: can you imagine the outcry if they make this change on retail too KEKW
[4:46:59] AveragePvp: They are making us start at 0 now instead of 1500 though
[4:47:10] Justarandomman: But it makes no sense in having to maintain a rating lol
[4:47:12] dalaraz: seriously without wanting to be offensive,if someone needs 2 months to level up,bc is the wrong wow version
[4:47:19] Vexxsis: @lilrogueTV yeah i been gone over a year from classic , so my guild least got me caught up in bwl gear , wich im content till tbc
[4:47:37] swordart_19: @DeNiLLx There is rating for better gear since release what you talk about.
[4:47:54] NILLme: @swordart_19 you have to maintain that rating to be able to wear the gear
[4:47:54] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:47:55] RhadigarTV: @Towelliee There are no rating requirements to purchase Arena gear from a previous season.
[4:47:59] Sneekzx: @Vexxsis Well that was nice of them! I got a rogue to Naxx and 6/9 T3 but I won't be continuing him since rogues aren't that great D:
[4:48:01] NovaSun84: uff as a paladin, good luck
[4:48:05] AveragePvp: Not equip though chat
[4:48:07] jason_shade: healthy like live pvp Kappa
[4:48:08] swordart_19: @DeNiLLx that should not exist in classic either .
[4:48:12] drwest132: yeah idk whats wrong with that pvp change seems fine to me
[4:48:19] Justarandomman: As a paladin just wait to s4 and ret goes boom
[4:48:32] Holysal: just go ret and run with a shaman @Towelliee
[4:48:38] dalaraz: holy pala is fine in arenas
[4:48:40] jeziorek: oh yeah u will for sure Kappa
[4:48:48] NILLme: they are also adding a brand new pvp title
[4:48:49] swordart_19: yes
[4:48:50] oldmangamer0: Yup
[4:48:52] Vexxsis: @lilrogueTV shit , rogues are dank in bc
[4:48:59] NovaSun84: BM hunters blow shit up right now, might be able to outgear most comps with a hpal
[4:49:01] drwest132: haha
[4:49:03] maccaruso: Enhance shaman took it on the chin with the new PvP changes
[4:49:15] Saphirez: Alright so real talk, when do we get the hottub stream ?
[4:49:17] dalaraz: you need to go holy and find a decent warrior
[4:49:23] Justarandomman: But not only hit it, but you must also maintain that rating as far as I understand?
[4:49:24] dalaraz: ret wont go 2050 in season 1 :p
[4:49:26] NILLme: i doubt there will be many boosters if you are unable to wear the gear if you are bellow that rating LUL
[4:49:27] Holysal: yeah
[4:49:29] Justarandomman: How does that work if you change team
[4:49:44] Vexxsis: holy yes
[4:49:54] dalaraz: holy is pretty decent
[4:49:57] SilkeySmooth: lower city rep spell power mace would be easier to get
[4:50:03] wraaith: isnt 5v5 a thing in bc wont people just get boosted there ?
[4:50:04] Vexxsis: lower city rep
[4:50:06] Xarith: Holy in 5s
[4:50:15] Justarandomman: Are they implementing PUG style areans or is it going to be you need to play with your friend
[4:50:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A0WYo3VOSI Disney is showing off a retractable lightsaber
[4:50:51] NILLme: @Justarandomman no pug style like on retail, you have to join a team and play in it
[4:51:14] SilkeySmooth: lower city rep mace
[4:51:14] Vexxsis: did 2's with my GF back then got pretty high hemo rogue/demon destro lock...good times
[4:51:26] Justarandomman: @DeNiLLx mm i think they may be difficult these days, people give up after 1 loss and rage quit team lol
[4:51:35] dalaraz: i guess you s hould get the epic mace from lower city rep,its not that much worse @Towelliee
[4:51:37] Unciatim: @HaxzorJimDuggan Ok.. that is wicked
[4:51:49] SilkeySmooth: it's 205 spell power I believe
[4:51:49] DrakhanGaming: what are the blood elf racials in tbc
[4:51:52] dalaraz: @Towelliee its 30 less sp but has crit than resi
[4:52:39] NovaSun84: 4 BMs and a resto shaman is going to be our Guild's TBC meta KEKW

[4:54:17] Vexxsis: according to him its not good for pvp lol

[4:59:51] TheOGDaywalker: yeah that blows my mind, bears are so invincible
[4:59:54] TheOGDaywalker: already
[4:59:59] Helliose: well the trade off for the survivability is that the guardian druids don't have much in the way of DPS
[5:00:27] DrakhanGaming: turn meatball into a sub
[5:00:35] MicNoobs: meatball MAD

[5:05:50] DrakhanGaming: the one tank spec that uses a 2h sword is the lowest dps KEKW
[5:06:53] Holysal: @ajjthedk yeah they buffed all dmg by 6% on ptr
[5:07:02] Helliose: you going for bulk or lean?
[5:07:58] deckardblade: i think most people that are on the heavier side have strong calves (source: myself)
[5:08:11] peinen: that June 1st TBC release has gotta be a troll... right?
[5:08:20] jakemossy2154: i went to a football camp under Nick Saban when i was pretty young and my calves have been conditioned since lol 6 hour practices
[5:08:28] psychodivinity: @towelliee May the 4th be with you!

[5:09:09] jakemossy2154: SWTOR?

[5:10:04] givmeafrekinname: @peinen A lot of people think the June 1st date was just an old release day ad that Blizz forgot to remove from the launcher.
[5:10:07] maccaruso: Hahaha.  I know that game.
[5:10:18] maccaruso: "Nobody beats the Blob!"
[5:10:18] RockemSockem0821: its muk

[5:12:18] Eraste: So, if pre patch on the 18th, and assuming 1 month pre patch, 1 month of tbc launch, 9.1 could be july 13th danEww
[5:12:34] Alexkayzz: wait 9.1. is not today?
[5:12:40] Clorichu: what are the pre-requisites for flying?
[5:12:41] Hyrja: may as well be august at this rate
[5:12:57] Biorrwolf: But what if...2 week pre-patch? 🤔
[5:13:06] Wildside1177: That means they will likely miss earning estimates.
[5:13:19] swordart_19: MMO champ streams quartely
[5:13:23] Artivicii: https://youtu.be/WMLOmWg3x4s
[5:13:28] Wildside1177: The stock dropping I mean
[5:13:29] givmeafrekinname: @Clorichu renown level I believe. Will be unlocked the 2nd week if you are up to date.
[5:13:30] Eraste: if 2 week pre patch / launch window, then june 15 for 9.1.. eh
[5:13:39] toobaked1987: @Towelliee the entire market is down. The S&P is getting shit on today.
[5:13:53] Clorichu: @jmg1988 nice, thanks
[5:14:04] Brodih_: maybe thats why they are rushing TBC, to make revenue
[5:14:15] Eraste: and we thought BFA was an unmitigated disaster
[5:14:32] drwest132: warzone such a good BR
[5:15:07] swordart_19: Warzone is Pog
[5:15:08] drwest132: it's good when you got a squad
[5:15:27] Hyrja: the start of shadowlands was awesome but the last 3-4 months have been shite
[5:15:28] drwest132: Trios and Squads make warzone hella more fun and entertaining for sure.
[5:15:34] jakemossy2154: they took apex literally?
[5:15:39] ruivobalistico: totally agree with apex
[5:16:53] Crowargus: elvui toggle frames

[5:23:33] Eraste: anything is better than 9.0 at this point danKEK
[5:23:54] Hyrja: TD was the best thing ever
[5:23:57] Machine42593: most fun in Mythic plus
[5:24:00] rsimpson105: fucking in da nile
[5:24:03] Machine42593: pull everything twlight Dev
[5:24:22] Machine42593: Hivemind lol
[5:24:23] TheVigiliance: BDK go brrrrr
[5:24:46] Eraste: nah corruption was an absolute embarrassment to the game
[5:25:10] DeanoTV: corruption was fun af
[5:25:23] Hyrja: the acquisition sucked in the begin but they fixed that
[5:25:26] DeanoTV: arms warr with haste corruption Kreygasm
[5:25:42] Eraste: fair enough - i disagree though also
[5:25:57] givmeafrekinname: And don't make the gear a weekly rotation NotLikeThis
[5:26:22] Crowargus: gushing wounds?
[5:27:13] swordart_19: true was fun gear
[5:27:42] TheVigiliance: Infinite stars was a bullshit trait, other than that, pretty fun

[5:27:50] Eraste: im just speaking to overall game wellness. sure it was kind of fun, but the borrowed power aspect was tuned to 11, and it was just a mess for the game
[5:27:50] xmedpakx: my havoc DH crushed with huge td procs
[5:28:02] Hyrja: 8.2 was also a good patch
[5:28:05] Hyrja: essences were fun
[5:28:50] Eraste: same
[5:28:57] Eraste: i tell my guild i miss BFA they just laugh
[5:28:57] mwchaos: yep
[5:29:04] xideontv: 7.0 was amazing until you had to farm AP
[5:29:05] Hyrja: or legion :p
[5:29:18] mwchaos: or go back to 7.2 legion
[5:29:20] Eraste: low key, i miss islands
[5:29:20] Machine42593: Wrld quests were better!
[5:29:21] drmabusee: i bought every exp - played 2 weeks and quit again -.-
[5:29:47] FalconBroadcasting: BfA was my first expansion, and while Legion and Panda sounded good in their heyday, BfA was perfect for me to be addicted for 1.5 years.
[5:30:18] TheVigiliance: Sounds like a skill issue Kappa
[5:30:31] Riggoz1: I don't want the player power grind that's endless,
[5:30:34] laceratedsky: lmfao
[5:30:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:30:36] Eraste: that was me through cata-legion but i found some old friends and joined up with a guild and been subbed since end of legion
[5:30:40] illuminationpaladincurse: No prepatch >?
[5:30:46] VictorAvalanche: Ion did say players need to get good
[5:30:50] FalconBroadcasting: Admittedly, I did play Shadowlands at launch for 1 week, and quit. Came back much later for... a month? Fell out again.
[5:30:52] dracullus: @Towelliee well 2 weeks of I assume lot of playing is good time/box price ration
[5:30:55] dracullus: ratio*
[5:31:10] korianti: They should bring pre-nerf TD back as an Anima Power
[5:31:17] Hyrja: i thought i wouldnt miss AP but i do
[5:31:27] drmabusee: i no lifed until cata. maybe im burned out forever =)
[5:31:30] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[5:31:33] Riggoz1: only reason I like this xpac because I don't gotta continue grind daily lol
[5:31:34] VictorAvalanche: when is solo que islands coming back?
[5:31:44] Holysal: 9.1
[5:32:04] Eraste: my no life xpac was wrath and i dont regret it - well, even then, i quit at ICC
[5:32:08] illuminationpaladincurse: convoked!
[5:32:11] fewyn: go see if it's on the ptr?
[5:32:16] givmeafrekinname: You just KNOW scaling in island will be fucked up too LUL
[5:32:19] xXSiebzehnXx: I skipped Cata LUL
[5:32:35] xXSiebzehnXx: Wish I hadn’t skipped any though
[5:32:44] RogueBear: dude back in Cata i had an 85 of every class except mage. im pretty sure i no lifed that expac too LUL
[5:33:05] Eraste: same - maybe tbc when i was a hardcore BG hero
[5:33:08] Biorrwolf: ICC was my no life expansion. In high school, trying to be quiet up at midnight with a guild that was 3 hours ahead
[5:33:10] Hyrja: no way
[5:33:27] theDirtyon3: @Towelliee half of that was mount farming though LUL
[5:33:30] 1Unselectable: MoP bis expansion
[5:33:33] Hyrja: i played all classes in Legion becuase i wanted the weapons. Now i play 1 :(
[5:33:35] PojaLive: I feel like Shadowlands mostly sucks for people who would usually play all day like streamers. There’s not much for y’all to do, but it’s not as bad for normies.
[5:33:45] Exodeo_: I miss Legion tbh
[5:33:46] vDrYuukey: ye fuck that
[5:33:59] xXSiebzehnXx: There was SO much grinding. I loved it
[5:34:08] Eraste: BFA had some issues, terrible story - I personally despised corruption - but I played the hell out of it and I loved nazjatar
[5:34:32] Biorrwolf: Legion was pretty amazing. Second best in my opinion to Wrath, but I also came in at the tail end of TBC
[5:35:00] xXSiebzehnXx: Sometimes you gotta invig dem bawls
[5:35:03] BRUTALIT0PS: Shadowlands story is fucking amazing! The content, not so much
[5:35:13] Shamwise: @Towelliee Anymore TBC keys today?
[5:35:22] Biorrwolf: The book leading up to BFA was a lot better than the expansion itself
[5:35:22] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[5:35:33] jakemossy2154: I kinda come and go as they nerf and buff arcane mage lol
[5:36:01] drmabusee: i think the story line is what brings me back to every exp.
[5:36:05] mrelgaato: What about sword?)
[5:36:07] Eraste: i find myself not caring about any of the SL characters
[5:36:07] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:36:22] dracullus: imo 10.0 will be BfA part 2
[5:36:37] Vadagar1: ... and the sword of Sargears is still there
[5:36:43] kamisengames: Wooons
[5:36:45] theDirtyon3: we sent him where he wanted toi go pretty much
[5:36:50] theDirtyon3: back to the void
[5:36:54] Biorrwolf: SL feels like another 'setup' expansion. Hopefully they don't make returning to a time dilated Azeroth another expansion though
[5:36:58] TheCliffyShow: I think the Old Gold that go chucked into space will come back somehow.
[5:37:07] theDirtyon3: the void
[5:37:13] Moobot: All giveaways can be found on our Discord under the #Stream channel! discord.gg/towelliee
[5:37:16] Eraste: if they do another faction war xpac... im out KEKW
[5:37:26] theDirtyon3: yep
[5:37:33] the0_o: BFA had a ton of potential, image the horde holding darkshore with a teldrassil raid in which it burns due to a third party starting the fire, the alliance raids ZUL in response then more tension as the alliance feeds out it was an inside job but Night elfs that want all out war
[5:37:33] Vadagar1: HE goes to the Voidy-Lands
[5:37:52] laeenaravenholdt: laeenaravenholdt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 36 months and counting!
[5:37:59] Lifestream7: Hey just joined, is TBC release fake or legit?
[5:38:03] Biorrwolf: Who's ready for more timey wimey nonsense though? What with SL's altered flow of time
[5:38:07] TheCliffyShow: I think the Old Gold that got chucked into space by a Titan will come back somehow. Infused with some crazy, cosmic enegry.
[5:38:11] Squirrel_nutty: tbc soon
[5:38:53] Biorrwolf: Maybe Azeroth will have started to hatch by the time we come back
[5:38:55] Molvonos: @TheCliffyShow If you're thinking Y'shaarj, he was popped like a zit in the titan's fist.  Like, an overripe fruit squishing everywhere.
[5:39:06] Sielu11628: @Lifestream7 Fakgit
[5:39:09] FreshgamingQ: probably old news, but haven`t been here in a while, are you still in california?
[5:39:11] xmedpakx: @Biorrwolf you have a point,, SL time is different then normal time right?
[5:39:16] neverbornlucky: what if the titans the bad guy and old gods good guys

[5:40:19] Bombayshow: neverbornlucky they all have their own agenda. light void , necro wild gods, order all the same not bad not evil
[5:40:20] Biorrwolf: @archaic78 yeah. I'm not sure exactly how it's different, but I believe it's moving much slower in SL than in Azeroth. Bellular did a good video on it a while ago
[5:40:30] jakemossy2154: maybe nobody is a good guy
[5:41:20] Biorrwolf: @xxsiebzehnxx it's gonna be the big blue lady herself, and then bam! The sword corrupts and we're stuck fighting from Outlands

[5:42:56] Eraste: depends if they want to stack 9.1 with tbc or not.. if not, something has to been rushed forward
[5:43:12] Eraste: agree
[5:43:40] Squirrel_nutty: #stop the stacking
[5:43:48] Biorrwolf: If release is actually June 1st, a month of pre-patch would be great
[5:44:13] General_SushiBuns: could anyone tell me what the best leveling rout in retail is atm?
[5:44:21] Volkmargrim: Prepatch probably still 18th
[5:44:24] Aidler: back in the days it took me years to get to lvl 60 and above - lol
[5:44:24] Eraste: well, if it was june 1st, prepatch would have to be today and it'd still only be 3 weeks (we know thats all not true, but ya)
[5:44:43] LeonardLongNips: 60-70 is about 70ish hours if you are at a decent pace
[5:44:43] dalaraz: prepatch is may 18 most likely
[5:45:00] General_SushiBuns: thought they nerfed the chests? and i am horde on illidan
[5:45:04] Biorrwolf: @general_sushibuns MOP is petty fast as well. Legion is the most streamlined experience though
[5:45:04] Volkmargrim: @Eraste prepatch gonna be like two weeks long imo
[5:45:20] Eraste: wow that long? i had totally forgot
[5:45:39] Eraste: @Eraste im okay with 2 weeks. would like to level a draenei sham but think 2 weeks should be plenty
[5:45:48] Molvonos: Honored for Heroic keys yea?
[5:46:01] dalaraz: leveling time is more bout competition over mobs tbh
[5:46:04] Biorrwolf: What realm is the hammer squad on?
[5:46:05] Holysal: that what i want to do as well
[5:46:18] dalaraz: @Biorrwolf azuresong horde
[5:46:19] Molvonos: Man i can't WAIT to grind hillsbrad and black fuckass for rep. towDrunk
[5:46:24] Kinghorn: the keys to do heroics
[5:46:39] Eraste: dude im hyped
[5:46:47] jakemossy2154: then they fucked up in WOD
[5:47:04] Biorrwolf: @dalaraz Ty. Should I leave Bloodsail though 🤔
[5:47:20] xmedpakx: TBC classic wont be new players mostly though
[5:47:25] Unciatim: @Towelliee New Blue updates for TBC PVP posted... https://tbc.wowhead.com/news/no-rating-requirements-to-purchase-arena-gear-from-previous-season-322161
[5:47:45] xmedpakx: thus the problem with classic versions, too many who know everything
[5:47:55] xmedpakx: think they know evceryting*
