[2:05:16] TweektheProphet: @Towelliee I'm late so sorry if you already talked about it but did you see what happened during the bills game
[2:05:26] Effin_Steffin: i knew this expansion was gonna be a banger when pickpocketing was back on Rogues, and Teleporter malfunctions in Engineering were fun again
[2:05:28] smol_gunner: crafting in general is bad, but hey, I get ppl like change for the sake of change
[2:05:39] mavericks312: also prayers up for damar hamlin
[2:05:43] fistofnature: there are literally no people doing it on my alliance low pop server PepeHands
[2:05:43] Shrenko: @BoezIRL cobalt thing?
[2:05:49] Kelticlore: imo work order system should become cross server
[2:05:49] 1s2real: In 5 hours I got 2 toons to 70 by doing the cobalt farm and tagging mobs
[2:05:53] Mecabeast: yeah public orders was definitely a ball dropped
[2:05:54] Kanrad: Tip for those that don't know, your alts can place work orders with other alts so you can get your skill-ups etc
[2:05:56] PenguinBreaker: I would like to see built in rescaling of windows added to the edit options. You can do it with addons, so I feel it will be added in the future
[2:06:02] vaxster86: @mavericks312 ok thanks.. will have a look when i log on later <3
[2:06:14] 1s2real: Ranger is easier , melee got to watch the floors or you’ll get oneshotted
[2:06:23] Aquadriel: i think the whole work order system is POORLY explained by blizzard and only those who did it a lot in beta got to understand it and started with a big advantage
[2:06:30] Onlyyours2: Onlyyours2 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:06:51] mavericks312: the work order system needed to be tested more on beta

[2:07:01] 1s2real: In season 2 work order are gunna be expensive
[2:07:03] CipansR_Ayaya: yep
[2:07:43] falldrgn: professions are cool.. but yeah, its complicated.
[2:07:49] mavericks312: the only thing i want changed with profs is allow me to respec my points
[2:07:56] Reinkaos999: same
[2:08:09] LearnedSomething: what happens if you drop the profession and relearn it?
[2:08:17] UninspiredUsername_: Howdy, I’ve been thinking on what mmorpg’s to play, any advice for a 1st timer?
[2:08:19] Noshpan: I thought we got away from garbage systems like that?
[2:08:20] Broomba: It’s like playing profession roulette
[2:08:23] Adventw0lf: I don't want to respec points.
[2:08:41] R3b1rth_: UI could be definitely be better, bloated, or missing information
[2:08:48] mavericks312: someone in my guild has made close to 3.5 mill on lariat orders in the last week
[2:08:52] K0rzak0v: and you need to be online 24/7 advertising it in trade chat and handling all kinds of questions and insults :p

[2:08:55] Adventw0lf: If you can respec prof points it's going to be like respeccing your character. You'll change depending on the need at the time which ruins the whole point of it
[2:09:01] Molvonos: Nah, Disintegrate's always a channel
[2:09:13] NavalRainDrops: no cost but havent seen a no cast
[2:09:16] Molvonos: There's been some buggy nonsense in the last two months where it will cut out or not cast
[2:09:21] StraightErro: Some professions don't translate well to work orders, like enchanting or engineering. Enchants you can just get off the AH and only other Engineers can use engineer goods, so they'll just make it themselves
[2:09:42] PenguinBreaker: Maybe with every major patch they'll offer it
[2:09:42] NickLeonhearth: make a new character with the profession

[2:23:27] Adventw0lf: @Towelliee Echo had to get world first. Preach had an office to go dry out.
[2:23:27] Incredible_Sausage: well it poofed on me an hour ago so that's my only point of reference.
[2:23:37] sinlesssinner: what if liquid won?  @Towelliee , would you have said the same?

[2:24:28] Redpandalol: @towelliee hot take Bliz undoes the 10% nerf for all the tanks except warrior coming.
[2:24:44] Gingerprimer: Also end of Sanctum was god tier
[2:25:27] Mecabeast: CN wad rebuilding for echo, with echo winning 3 tiers straight since SOD its pretty apparent they're the best guild
[2:25:38] Sollice: I wish they wouldn't be so quick to nerf but more buffs
[2:25:45] Djfarmville: they equip a shield
[2:25:47] Sollice: To get classes more level
[2:26:04] Adventw0lf: Most tanks don't even have a tanking stance though
[2:26:23] odinsdad75: the best part of the race for me was listening to Jeathe on commentary!

[2:26:50] PvtHudson093: Did i miss vault opening?
[2:26:51] Adventw0lf: That's a passive, not a stance @Towelliee It's not something they choose. It's something done. It also doesn't decrease the dmg they do.

[2:27:17] instant_savage: nah he is talki g about every tank passive 10% dmg dexrease they took most of them away
[2:27:19] Adventw0lf: Battle Stance and Defensive Stance is cool because it gives them the option when off tanking to deal more dmg. What they need to do is lower the defensiveness of warriors so they actually feel threatened when not in it
[2:27:22] baldnfattv: no other class has had a stance like DK/warrior when they give up damage to take less dmg
[2:27:24] rocketise: @Incredible_Sausage yea
[2:27:26] SamuraiWillZ916: Glad*
[2:27:32] dohvic: Like Blood Presence for DK
[2:27:33] Adventw0lf: Ya it's a passive.
[2:27:33] Karbonn: I men, bear form is technically a stance

[4:10:21] Slaanesh74: the faeline stomp thing is a good idea, but with ground effects on top of ground effects, it's an example of too much

[4:20:56] nuttall_96: nuttall_96 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[4:20:58] artiBEAST: The last trash pack and that water elemental dot you can los just feels terrible lol
[4:20:58] Lewi_lew: People literally lust the last trash lol
[4:20:59] Nerdmeat_: It seems like Jade trash does more damage than any other dungeon trash
[4:21:15] MapenEG: to be honest either nerf all the dungeons or buff shadowmoon and call it a day Kappa
[4:21:17] ToastedYolkz: thundering not great
[4:21:22] Snabido: Bring back Infested SwiftRage
[4:21:29] letrickyxd: It's technically not random. It happens after every 60 seconds of combat time, still a shit affix tho
[4:21:29] Wcvechten: Okay but consider this, Infested was worse
[4:21:29] RzaDza: what is the worst affix
[4:21:30] ApeManXXL: and happy arms is still getting love
[4:21:41] ToastedYolkz: probably just do a visual change FeelsBadMan

[4:22:09] LoremasterMarthan: Meanwhile I am ilvl 390 and being declined for +8s lol
[4:22:10] ProPaineTheThird: thats shadowmoon though, easy af
[4:22:14] alwayspounding: Same I saw. Like someone doing a35k it’s crazy
[4:22:15] Hypertitan: I don't do higher keys...i don't have a good experience in most cases...for me anyways
[4:22:17] JasperCalico: Shadowmoon is a free key
[4:22:18] Baykerz: I agree Thundering is not good but i cannot agree that thundering is worse than infested
[4:22:19] ProPaineTheThird: have them do any other dungeon and see what happens
[4:22:26] aleck1776: Jeez lol
[4:22:29] Vriplol: @Towelliee add disc priest buff
[4:22:31] bigg_tex: I don’t think tank threat is high enough it’s far too easy to rip threat from tank
[4:22:34] sinlesssinner: seems Fortified weeks are way harder in DF m+ dungs
[4:22:36] ramb0_: @towelliee is it too late to get into dragonflight? I fear not being able to get into anything because of raider io
[4:22:37] Q_TheDreamer: I was tanking a +6 Shadowmoon yesterday and one of our DPS DC'd right before the first boss. Still timed it
[4:22:37] Zonoxx_tv: 415 ye
[4:22:42] aleck1776: Im 378 and doing that and havent touched anything over a 13
[4:22:43] alwayspounding: 418

[4:23:04] gienioslav: gienioslav subscribed with Prime. 
[4:23:06] Theduskflyer: Leave SBG alone. Let us have the free dungeon
[4:23:10] NickLeonhearth: 3 weeks into the exp, is it too late :D
[4:23:12] ramb0_: Roger
[4:23:13] RzaDza: I timed every dungeon on 17 this week felt nice
[4:23:13] WingedChipmunk: the other issue with thundering is that people clear it INSTANTLY against my choice. Like i have this damage buff (while yes I can't feel it, i know it's their) someone else has the choice to remove this buff. Like how is that a good design
[4:23:18] Shaele: you just need to work your way up. Do 2s, 3s, and go up and up
[4:23:18] ApeManXXL: biggest problem ive had pugging higher keys is healers
[4:23:19] griiffinnn: @scarlett_begonias_ i believe the last week of Jan
[4:23:19] ClassicMalcontent: Fooled you. Haven't run a single dungeon or raid in DF. Kappa (yet)
[4:23:28] c0mmander_starscream: INB4 "Reee Swipe card"
[4:23:29] Doohzyy: can easily catch up in this expansion more than others
[4:23:31] StraightErro: grind everything to +2s, then move onto 3s, and build up that IO
[4:23:31] Ryvden: my alt is 385 ilevel and still gets declined for M0s lol
[4:23:32] SG_World: draenor timewalking, time to learn shadowmoon fights XD
[4:23:34] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[4:23:36] iraf__: wait today is the vault?
[4:23:38] REALPolarbeezy: link for cobalt vod?
[4:23:40] technicalta: Plenty of folks doing lower keys
[4:23:43] LeideGaming: just kill rares/feast and weekly. easy to catch up and be 380+
[4:23:46] im_capy: If people can play multiple alts in a week and not fall behind, you can catch up 1 toon easy
[4:23:48] Somchi: the importance of "run your own key" is crazy right now if oyure behind in IO
[4:23:50] millerhighlife89: thats why i grind 2 - 5s for gear before i start push
[4:23:51] Q_TheDreamer: orly
[4:23:51] MinivannGaming: By doing weekly reward tasks (Seige, Soup, Trials) and world quests as well as LFG Normals/Heroics - no reason you can't get to 370 or greater
[4:23:54] ClassicMalcontent: *alts alts alts 'ketchup' with catch-up and I'll wait for Blizz to 'balance' things. Heh. Then I'll step in.
[4:23:58] JasperCalico: I wonder how broken Evoker is gonna be with timewalking since its never been tested
[4:23:59] TheMachine_907: Very Alt friendly & easy to gear up
[4:24:03] temp3st98: it is
[4:24:04] iraf__: dude legion has the worst dungeons
[4:24:11] futomara01: it is, isnt
[4:24:13] futomara01: it
[4:24:27] ripperofbong420: that makes alot more sense
[4:24:29] Doohzyy: @iraf__ that's a hot take
[4:24:33] HonestPhilosophy: Max was saying they should just take affixes out of the game lol
[4:24:43] othraerir: typical blizz screwing pets
[4:24:47] Qraka: hmmm yes yes buff demo locks
[4:24:50] Molvonos: Oh no, hunter tears, aboohoohoo.
[4:24:50] Snabido: Casually leaving out UHdk
[4:24:51] Ariaeterna: @Doohzyy maybe by m+ standards?
[4:24:54] WingedChipmunk: when doesnt surv hunter get screwed
[4:25:00] Ariaeterna: compared to now I mean
[4:25:04] Aquadriel: pet class player opinions dont matter
[4:25:12] Heero_Effect: Duck DKs I guess
[4:25:15] SpoofAvatar: Year of the Spear is over :P
[4:25:16] Grainhouse: good morn to the man the myth the legend himself how are you this fine day
[4:25:16] abracka_: survival hunter SL, go fish
[4:25:26] Doohzyy: @Ariaeterna he must've skipped bfa m+ KEKW
[4:25:27] boopbopbamski: @Aquadriel as a MM hunter I matter Pog
[4:25:33] gzus81: Survival was solid all throughout BFA too, but BM was just too strong
[4:25:41] abracka_: that court of stars take is horrible lmao
[4:25:41] Vriplol: ???????
[4:25:41] galinhoo: CoS sucks
[4:25:44] letrickyxd: CoS is not that hard
[4:25:47] mattbrahhyayeet: cos IS EASY AF
[4:25:48] Zilberg: Court of stars is so easy
[4:25:50] Djfarmville: the rp part def in cos
[4:25:51] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:25:52] Vriplol: i love COS
[4:25:53] Sollice: Survival is just a weird spec in general...Realisitically whats the point of the class?
[4:25:54] Zonoxx_tv: I hate CoS
[4:25:54] LoremasterMarthan: Court of Stars I guess to be fair has more "gimmicks" than a regular dungeon would
[4:25:56] TheMachine_907: COS is easy mode
[4:25:56] Jarlan23: i didnt play legion and im fucking luts in court idk what im doing
[4:25:59] taylorsdank: he probably got spotted by the dragon whelps lol
[4:26:01] ZachTriesTooHard: CoS is probably the easiest next to SBG lol
[4:26:02] mattbrahhyayeet: Maybe they talking about the imposter?
[4:26:03] aleck1776: Until the tank doesnt know what hes doing kek but yeah COS is free loot
[4:26:04] derry10: what if the tank doesn't know what to do?
[4:26:04] TheMachine_907: easy mode for sure
[4:26:04] AdoraVal: Yeah but what if your Tank doesn't know?
[4:26:06] Nuvak1711: CoS is NOT hard at all it's a totally free key
[4:26:07] boopbopbamski: I watched a 3 min dungeon video b4 each dungeon :)
[4:26:07] TheCheeseWheel87: Novel idea there, follow the tanks
[4:26:09] Nerdmeat_: Yeah but I'm tanking CoS and I get lost all the time lol
[4:26:09] mattbrahhyayeet: COS Trinket is sex
[4:26:09] Snabido: Click the shiny pylons, listen to npc about disguised demon
[4:26:10] Hypertitan: I don't do CoS...i never really did it in legion and I feel lost in there now haha
[4:26:10] Lewi_lew: Trash pulling in offensive isnt hard but annoying lol to get 100%
[4:26:11] ApeManXXL: hov has been my go to for higher keys
[4:26:11] Heero_Effect: Eh I just follow the tank. But idk what’s happening lol
[4:26:11] JqydeeR6: CoS is easy and has bonkers loot
[4:26:13] soth_klf: CoS is BIS dungeon
[4:26:13] letrickyxd: CoS is great, just the last boss can be iffy
[4:26:15] TheNoidd: last boss on tyran does a lot of dam
[4:26:16] DoctorDake: I get that though; CoS has the minibosses you have to trigger, the NPC mystery to solve, etc. None of that is clearly explained if you haven't done it before.
[4:26:16] motorboatingpro: I either brick, or 2 star CoS
[4:26:17] Qtss: ive gotten many tanks who dont know what to do in COS
[4:26:17] shale93: I can imagine group of people that have never done CoS to be confused KEKW
[4:26:18] jeffnsteff2019: jeffnsteff2019 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! tragic night in NFL history
[4:26:18] tenaja22: I agree @LoremasterMarthan
[4:26:19] StraightErro: COS at least has some variety with the buff items
[4:26:27] thetruegodofwarr: I’ve watched a lot of people die to the fel blast from the executioners from not LOSing
[4:26:30] MaliciousDH: Legion dungeons have too much RP
[4:26:31] jbmoongirl: I like cos…just have to watch the wild pulling, can’t jump in Willy nilly
[4:26:31] REALPolarbeezy: yes there is
[4:26:37] TheCheeseWheel87: subcreation.net
[4:26:38] galinhoo: It is as they said, easy for the people with experience and terrible for people without it.
[4:26:40] Calphurnious: I did a +5 with three 10 year olds yesterday, was fun and we 3 keyed it
[4:26:42] SpoofAvatar: LUL
[4:26:43] lirly__: subcreation
[4:26:45] murph__dog: CoS has a lot of unintuitive stuff for a group that hasn't seen it, like how fel enforcers spawn and what draws the minibosses
[4:26:47] OhNoNotAgain: @Sollice At this point, just a 3rd spec for hunter and saying 3rd spec is very loose given its historical uselessness outside of s3/s4 SL

[4:26:51] irvingxander: no dungeon is hard this season. got 3k on the 1sr week
[4:26:51] Jarlan23: most of my court runs go to shit because extra enforcers spawn or people die on last boss
[4:26:52] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Cros_92 (warning)
[4:26:52] coldarmorTBG: I feel like if most of the people who struggle with dungeons would just download DBM, everyones lives would be easier...
[4:26:53] truefaith11: yeah subcreation does it weekly for the affixes
[4:26:54] Siddydiddydo: As a tank coming into CoS who didnt run it ever before this expansion, there are so many trash packs before the first boss that get pulled randomly by DPS. Most people also dont understand the profession/class items in the dungeons either
[4:26:55] Lewi_lew: ret pally pre raid is like half COS
[4:26:55] gzus81: I don't think its a coincidence that all the DF dungeons feel rough as opposed to the old ones
[4:27:07] SSD511_: Cos + we wipe like 18 times because a new tank don’t know what’s going on
[4:27:17] SSD511_: +2
[4:27:20] ZachTriesTooHard: actually based list
[4:27:24] DogShep: https://tiermaker.com/create/ @Towelliee

[4:27:26] Triggered: Seeing mistweaver that low Sadge
[4:27:27] Sollice: @Sollice I mean exactly. Nothing really unique about it. Play another melee class thats better at everything. There really isn't any spec identity to it
[4:27:28] StraightErro: @Zonoxx_tv rest is in 34min
[4:27:29] jeffnsteff2019: man game of football will change after that event last night my prayers and thoughts go to Hamlins family in this tough time

[5:06:16] TheResinger: @Towelliee icon is party based btw, so just be in a diffrent party than the other tank that has it
[5:06:19] Zilberg: Ez choice
[5:06:32] Varryan: Icon is the way to go no doubt
[5:06:35] Ordicos: that trinket like bis for most classes that i play
[5:06:35] gzus81: that means you also dont have to roll against others in raid
[5:06:36] Odinslayer: go icon dude
[5:06:41] wraaith: and its probs something ur not gonna get over dps rolls in main raids
[5:06:44] sinlesssinner: nah your infusion is based on the spec you are, what stats you get from the others is from their infusion, right?

[5:07:51] rapstah: blootmallet is showing icon not very high, anyone know why?
[5:07:52] dutchie76: This is a solid stat stick and gets better when you can get multiple buffs. I would use this as it never loses value. Just to keep in mind, this has lower drop rate than other trinkets and could be harder to get.
[5:08:14] Cheapesttactics1: I got prot warrior two set
[5:08:14] dutchie76: wowhead has it A tier
[5:08:28] Varryan: @rapstah check the talent path bloodmallet uses
