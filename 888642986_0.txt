[0:19:10] SlayerLightStorm: towHi
[0:19:11] Chrissfrosty: aww good morning people
[0:19:49] SlayerLightStorm: Not a good morning for me.
[0:20:12] SubbieSanta: i stubbed my toe heating up taco meat
[0:20:33] SubbieSanta: but i got to watch my son fall asleep sitting up so it all evens out

[0:20:55] L4dy_Renegade: Aww. :D
[0:21:07] L4dy_Renegade: towHi Morning!
[0:21:11] SlayerLightStorm: @UncleSubbie I think I'm going to get fired from my job.
[0:21:26] L4dy_Renegade: D: Oh no.. Why so?

[0:22:17] SlayerLightStorm: @L4dy_Renegade Did something stupid I shouldn't've, but ultimately did the right thing.
[0:24:17] L4dy_Renegade: @L4dy_Renegade As long as you know that you did the right thing, that should be all that matters. I know that doesn't change the fact that you could be losing work because of it, but there's still the silver lining of knowing you did right by you.
[0:24:44] MrGattz: depending on what it was and what the right thing was and how obvious it was to do, if you get fired for it you can take those cases to court to keep your job.
[0:24:47] L4dy_Renegade: All the same, I wish you best, and I hope everything works out for the best, fam. <3
[0:25:13] L4dy_Renegade: Gattz brings up a good point as well.
[0:25:46] MrGattz: for example if you bring up a sexual harassment in the work place and you get fired for it you can bring that to court
[0:28:10] SlayerLightStorm: @MrGattz Well, if I do get fired today, I'll have plenty more time for WoW.

[0:51:46] 91Niki: @DeanoTV Yeah it's such an annoying bug. i have it too
[0:51:47] othraerir: so did that mage have to tank his rating to help you? that;s how they do it?
[0:51:55] tahmkenchonly: have you gotten abyss worm mount yet ? @Towelliee
[0:51:57] Casual_Oppa: I'm at 50 games at 1731 rating, I just can't push past fire/mage 2's comps boosting
[0:52:01] Casual_Oppa: 500*
[0:52:09] ShruggAU: i had that texture flickering like you, if you go back to direct x version 11 it fixes it in game options
[0:52:41] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee that's because higher double dps are smart enough to focus you down, healer dps teams u can just out last as prot

[0:52:43] SorionTheGinger: well once double dps know what they are doing they are super dangerous
[0:52:46] actionring: ran an rbg to get 1600 before work...1599. fml
[0:52:47] 91Niki: @Towelliee im omw to spawn it

[0:53:29] actionring: gratz on 2100. I bet that felt good
[0:53:36] Chrissfrosty: night fae for what?
[0:53:46] casualboomer: I have a 14 PF on my vengeance DH
[0:53:50] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee I can drop my 16 SD to 14 if u want? i wont be doing it otherwise
[0:53:55] pilhass10: how much you paid?
[0:54:13] casualboomer: PvP boosts are absolutely required minimum skill level
[0:54:21] casualboomer: That's why the RMT crap isn't self-play
[0:54:42] casualboomer: High end PvPers are nutty. how much they know about the game is unreal.
[0:54:42] Chrissfrosty: what if you werte so bad that u couldnt get to that rank would u get ur money back?
[0:55:01] stuffe92: its fun to do both pve/pvp this xpack
[0:55:04] CritcobainTV: @Chrissfrosty Usually they'd try to find another person to boost you. different class or higher rating
[0:55:05] pilhass10: @Chrissfrosty for sure I would say unless he got scammed
[0:55:11] casualboomer: @Chrissfrosty we would refund you prorated based on the rating you achieved
[0:55:31] casualboomer: So if you bought 1800-2100 boost, and only got to 1900, you'd get 2/3 the cost back
[0:55:32] CritcobainTV: @casualboomer wait, you're a pvp booster?
[0:55:33] 91Niki: towRee
[0:55:38] casualboomer: @critcobain no, I sell boosts
[0:55:45] CritcobainTV: Gotcha
[0:55:48] casualboomer: our community does pvp, pve, leveling, mounts etc
[0:55:49] GermanBacon: towRee to reddit
[0:56:00] WoW_StandalonE: final boss
[0:56:02] CritcobainTV: @casualboomer I shall buy a 2100 boost for 3 hugs and 80kg :) thanks
[0:56:05] SorionTheGinger: @casualboomer how often does that happen?
[0:56:28] pilhass10: are you going for 2400? or no balls
[0:56:36] Chrissfrosty: mskes since
[0:56:39] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee That's why people risk the games. if you win 1 match after reset at 2100+, then farm your honor in RBGS or 3's, you'll get 3 more 226s next week
[0:56:45] casualboomer: @SorionZ more often this expansion than in BfA... PvP has been weird so far this expansion because they took dampening out of 2s
[0:57:00] Cosmolus: how do you open thevault like that ?
[0:57:08] Lunar_fangz: i really wish i could pvp lol
[0:57:10] casualboomer: granted, they're hotfixing dampening back into 2s today
[0:57:25] Cosmolus: wait ... my sub ran out ...
[0:57:25] CritcobainTV: dampening in 2's again? towPog
[0:57:48] PoppaShot: @towelliee bought some gfuel with your code today can’t wait for it
[0:57:54] casualboomer: I think it will balance things pretty well. Because some of the DPS specs like Ret and Arms have so much self-healing
[0:58:06] casualboomer: And Ret/Prot being able to heal others will come back down
[0:58:07] Chrissfrosty: only in 2's right?
[0:58:12] Scoodles91: when they are 2 healers(tanks) its start at 20 if there is double dps there is no dampening
[0:58:12] casualboomer: only in 2s
[0:58:21] casualboomer: dampening wasn't taken out of 3s so no need to put it back
[0:58:23] Armdel: pretty epic changes
[0:58:36] Tokies: Yo!

[1:35:04] josh8555: he said like 2mil
[1:35:19] Carrion_03: Did towel start from 0 rating?
[1:35:24] SilverSnowRoze: Hi. I'm not a PVPer
[1:35:25] CritcobainTV: it was 2 mil from 18 or 1900 i think. It's not 2 mil from 0 to 2100
[1:35:30] falsenx: about 400 bucks for a boost to 2100
[1:35:45] Gapz: @Towelliee once i was getting a boost in pvp and we queued against a friend of the booster, payed 10k for the win
[1:35:51] hildobagins: yesterday he was saying he would play with you
[1:35:54] bec0o: do you use same monk for windwalker or another toon?
[1:35:59] nezz231: 2 mil sounds way to little for boost that high?
[1:36:00] ark_exitWound: Why pay 2mil when you can get to 2k for free
[1:36:02] Gapz: @Towelliee Even they, between themselves do business lol
[1:36:14] ark_exitWound: Hmm each time there own I guess ☝🏻

[1:37:28] Aervyper: @Towelliee but the 2million cashed before he said that lol
[1:37:32] leanzyloham: mythic raid
[1:37:39] leanzyloham: Not mythic dungeons
[1:37:48] othraerir: you shouldn't be coming up against glad's though
[1:37:50] Cru3: how much gold did it cost?
[1:38:03] blu3sh0ck: I dont think you actually paid for it, i think this was a silent promo

[1:38:14] sinlesssinner: but do get all ur pvp gear to 226 then stop

[1:38:24] pilhass10: everyone has the title nowadays honestly
[1:38:31] casualboomer: OF COURSE he comes up against Glad teams. Because he's being boosted by a gladiator, which pulls his CR up enough to end up in 2400 average CR games

[1:40:10] xrader858: that frost mage isnt using the glacial augments legendary and it hurts me
[1:40:33] Chrissfrosty: couldnt u do 3 or higher without dropping
[1:40:44] casualboomer: There's so much gold in pvp boosting, it's nuts
[1:40:49] Shirey36: thats what happens when bliz locks ilvl behind rating

[2:02:03] letrickyxd: @PooL_ec reward any, but the exception is Generals and Sire, but when you kill them once on a difficulty, you unlcok the ability to get them on THAT difficulty ilvl

[2:03:13] Masqerader: for the legendary
[2:03:16] Artivicii: @justarandomman we just time pulls around cooldowns, not worth with frost mage output.

[2:40:15] datNovazGG: @Madnezz123 then just do your weekly chest and forget about loot for the rest of the week
[2:40:15] StateFarm206: Poe is so fun lol
[2:40:35] thebakeriscomingforu: and you can soothe them
[2:40:43] Madnezz123: Every pvp item has vers on it, vers is my worst stat for pve

[2:41:40] deedeemegadoodooo: have to be in combat
[2:41:42] gorilla_quantistico: you must be in combat for convoke
[2:42:12] gorilla_quantistico: depends on weeks and affixes
[2:42:20] PokerFaceMoose: barkskin for sure
[2:42:25] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee boomkin form has the same armor as bear form so u dont lose much
[2:42:26] warden86: i dont leave bear when i use
[2:42:41] Bigirishred: my buddy never leavves bear form
[2:42:42] StahliZero: why do you have to leave bear form?
[2:42:51] JellonaCub: I use it more to heal, soulshape away then convoke
[2:42:54] Wintersteel: you kite away and use it from range
[2:42:55] warden86: u shouldnt have to leave bear
[2:42:58] datNovazGG: What dorkibear does, is he pulls, make sure he has aggro.. start kiting (with slows from his teammates), enter boomkin form and does it.. :)
[2:43:01] Aggravius: if u can slow them then convoke in moonkin form
[2:43:01] jaytec2: drop earth ele and go boom form then cast
[2:43:03] xxKrayzie: leave bear form and die^^
[2:43:25] Fortune90: @Towelliee low M+ you can certainly get away with being balance affin, but in higher end content you want to be resto affin for the big passive heal that you get for ysera's gift. You can use balance affin in raids content as well.
[2:43:36] Wintersteel: @Towelliee It's what @datNovazGG just said
[2:44:01] Artivicii: I only do it when I know I can, like when first boss in mist is vulnerable
[2:44:14] Artivicii: I also always do it before boss pulls
[2:44:42] bicchiaki: how do you feel about tanking this xpac? it feels like they should change the name tanking to kiting tbh lol
[2:44:46] souplordtv: Doorki is the highest bear and he boomweaves. And in mythic raid they general feralweave. Not many people go resto affin anymore
[2:44:49] Artivicii: Some bosses who cast you can fit in like 5k dps in 2 seconds
[2:44:53] gorilla_quantistico: in twisting corridors i had a 40 sec cd convoke once
[2:45:16] duhworks: Pog bear tank!
[2:45:22] t1mnoo: What race and class he playing as?

[2:46:30] MarquisLek: anima drought
[2:46:44] Nehcrom: Need to get me some that sweet 35 anima.
[2:46:51] siradonis1: How much exp was that dungeon?
[2:46:56] Artivicii: And sometimes you can get away with being hit once or twice in boom form for the extra dps if u have big cahones

[5:45:11] VBTIGER89: That the attuide of a lot gamers
[5:45:12] WrongStaff: yup it has been always
[5:45:16] 91Niki: Like pve and pvp gearing should literally be equal, and neither should HAVE to do the other to gear.
[5:45:22] epiczplz: listen closely chat towle is spitting truth
[5:45:24] grizzlyhorn: there was always raiding before dedicated pvp
[5:45:27] Xindii: CouldYouNot
[5:45:53] L4dy_Renegade: We saw how the " pvp expansion " BfA ended up. LUL
[5:46:02] amrghr: just let pve ers get their bis gear from pve and vice versa. why should you do something you don't like in a game ?

[5:46:11] xXTHEJESTXx: speaking of MK does anyone else think its awesome that raiden voice actor is the voice actor for Alex mograine?
[5:46:19] NovaSun84: pvp players lacking empathy... I don't feel surprised @Towelliee
[5:46:21] Velashen: Something had to change with removal of titanforging. I think they will add a bit more loot in 9.1 but don't need to swing it back to making loot drop like candy.
[5:46:22] Thoreya: Pvp > m+
[5:46:35] epiczplz: like m bad for playing game lol
[5:46:41] Kromede: blame canada
[5:46:48] ayrennasky: tbh I think the issue is, if we balance and pve only need to do pve and pvp just pvp, pvpers would see their bgs and arenas quite empty, that's what blizz doesn't want
[5:46:59] Gerr_x: bring back resilience
[5:47:04] Action4000: 8.3 pvp was awful
[5:47:10] Dejon09: @91niki it’s pretty much like that now, how is it not? Except specialty items people want

[5:47:35] Flunktrumpet: @Towelliee Thanks for the group! My first kill of that guy lol
[5:47:39] 91Niki: @Dejon09 It's not tho. Pve'ers are going to pvp to get gear, because farming m+ isn't viable, only the vault is lol
[5:47:42] Dejon09: I don’t expect pvp gear to be better than mythic ever, wouldn’t be fair

[5:49:00] razma_: 1800
[5:49:01] BrutalBlueberry: 1800
[5:49:03] Dejon09: Oh yeah, it’s kind of forcing pvers to raid I guess.. well you want the best pve gear u got to

[5:49:12] xrandomdoodx: once they fix PVE loot, and every sector of Wow is happy, it will feel so much better
[5:49:15] BrutalBlueberry: Yes. Weapons are insane.
[5:49:18] Hregor: no way they manage to fix it in one patch when it took them 4 years or so to add pvp vendors
[5:49:25] suggartown: 1850
[5:49:27] puffytaco151: WoW has had 10 years to fix their shit. and you think it gonna be fixed in 2 more month.

[5:55:36] anjin89: to me paladin was easiest. you have most kicks and most utility

[5:56:03] Gerr_x: prot war yeah, you have multiple DR you have to use
[5:56:11] Fl3tchTTV: i find pally easiest now, easy resource to manage and understand, nerly 100% uptime on mitigation which means you don't have to worry about when to do it
[5:56:14] Czyszn: prot war is the dumbest gameplay loop
[5:56:14] Skizzurp: warriors dont have self heals so they def are sorta awkward
[5:56:20] CallMeWallie: I like warrior tanks, I felt the same about monk though
[5:56:24] CptTeempo: Towelliee danP
[5:56:26] CallMeWallie: Monk is a lot
[5:56:49] eziz86: Only need for hight mythic + tank dh i hope they nerf dh and Rshaman
[5:57:28] siradonis1: There is not really a choice right now, and that sucks
[5:57:31] notdustinx: rsham hasnt been good in 10 years shut the hell up rn
[5:57:42] Gerr_x: its mitigation, not a heal

[5:59:24] Gnral: prot pali is going to be the best tank for keys under 5+ and lrf PixelBob
[5:59:34] Fl3tchTTV: NW needed to be gutted, too punishing on tyrannical if you wipe once because you don't have pride or the items anymore, and likely no lust for 10 mins
[5:59:43] Aro725: this a dead week for keys for sure lol
[5:59:55] CptTeempo: danSad

[6:06:50] Cabbageman007: Its good to have Discussions...dont hate the opposing view
[6:06:58] CptTeempo: danP
[6:07:12] AvarexTV: You need some enticing anima first

[6:07:43] AvarexTV: You need anticing anima and activate the blaziers with it
[6:07:46] AvarexTV: @Towelliee
[6:07:51] Kneckt: @Towelliee the blue mobs drop enticing anima for the gorger spawn
[6:07:53] pavepawns: u have never seen a paladin in all your years use bop to remove a bleed? thats absurd
[6:07:55] Gerr_x: @chopsaki the only way you wouldnt know about boping things off is if you have never run with a pally on any stackable affix in the past 2 expansions, which means you have shit for experience, which means you probably shouldn't be saying 'lol you bad i dont believe you'
[6:07:55] pavepawns: even for new players
[6:08:00] draconisraccoonis: thats not the question ding dong, youre arguing about bop threat , if you dont have a pally then kite
[6:08:07] ch0ller: join a farm group
[6:08:09] Kneckt: kill the mobs for enticing anima
[6:08:11] AvarexTV: @Towelliee You need to kill the mobs and they drop enticing anima, then you light the brazier with it

[6:10:34] Xindii: drop triggers 7 consecutive day event
[6:10:35] Hononoe: you can't find item in your inventory its auto quest + its not 100%
[6:10:46] Winnie_theBro: It's a low percentage drop, then you care for the pet for 7 days wiht a daily quest
[6:10:47] anjin89: it doesnt start a quest, the item makes a mob spawn somewhere else that gives you quests
[6:11:03] Mecabeast: you farm mobs to get item to summon then he drops a purp quest that takes a week to complete
[6:11:20] CptTeempo: Kromede rooPog 8 years rooAww
[6:11:26] cheersfordoobies: he just turns into a mount

[6:11:27] therealgrinder123: is the avengers shield legendary worth?
[6:11:27] LolitaAldea: check your chat window, the item disapears from your bags. but it flags you for a daily quest that after a week gives you the mount
