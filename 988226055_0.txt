[1:51:23] MorbidDezirez: @Death_Pulse69 Its a WA

[1:51:30] warrenny: @cahoots82 Yeah cos nothing in world would cause delays 🤦♂️

[2:27:02] yunggluten: I'd love a good outdoor style raid
[2:27:07] ravenoushydra: edgy = cool tho
[2:27:07] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:27:19] mavericks312: raid designer must be a for hot topic worker
[2:27:19] moonscryer: or made a raid they actually put some time into.
[2:27:20] StarPriestessShika: i liked ZA
[2:27:21] yunggluten: Like more open, less overhead and closed corridor stuff
[2:27:27] DreamWebb: cant you get someone to make you an extension?
[2:27:27] Vivelli: sunwell was super bright i think
[2:27:27] S1appadabass: Dazar'alor

[2:28:32] codedizle: I like the dark grungy look LUL but there has been a lot of it ya could switch it up some
[2:28:38] CaptainJoeyNY: Nighthold was gorgeous
[2:28:39] WhiteKnight74648: Bastion raid?

[2:28:50] j_bar111: Hyjal wasnt super dark was it?
[2:28:50] adxx: a kyrian raid would be sick
[2:28:51] CaptainJoeyNY: @WhiteKnight74648 that would be awesome
[2:28:52] SmokedHog: it's a bunch of waves of mobs though
[2:28:57] Snausen: hyjal and TK
[2:29:06] yunggluten: Sanky D Pog
[2:29:09] Mecabeast: hyjal was outside too lol
[2:29:12] OigreSier: I like dark
[2:29:20] Armdel: now THATS dark
[2:29:23] Jokervenom1978: If we have an "evil" Light expac there will most likely be bright raids.
[2:29:29] Xockel: LUL
[2:29:36] KaisenSiru: That looks amazing
[2:29:36] Tyvokkaa: Facts
[2:29:37] kodtheog: super creative KEKW
[2:29:39] Fortvila: IMO feels like ICC
[2:29:39] yunggluten: Just wait
[2:29:40] Zibbp: :( more torghast
[2:29:40] Vivelli: p sure blizz doesnt link sandbox vids
[2:29:41] thegummibearmassacre: LUL
[2:29:42] w1ns1ow: NotLikeThis
[2:29:44] yunggluten: theres a lot more
[2:29:45] mavericks312: still pretty cool
[2:29:56] Yagr6: makes sense story wise i guess
[2:29:57] elitepower97: @Towelliee did you get your ZG boost on your warrior yet?
[2:29:59] yunggluten: some really cool looking rooms
[2:29:59] BigCarlM: Blizzard reuses and reskins as much as they possibly can
[2:30:00] othraerir: maybe a "build your own raid" optional raid :)
[2:30:01] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Aeton88 (warning)
[2:30:02] SmokedHog: so.... will there be anima power in the raid? THAT would be sick
[2:30:20] codedizle: I like the look
[2:30:20] j_bar111: LF rogue for SD to disarm traps
[2:30:31] Mecabeast: @kreyneron rumors the terragrue will till he hits 10%
[2:30:35] Frank4LuLz: shiny
[2:30:48] xluckydawgx: Probably Sylvannas part 2
[2:30:51] codedizle: next expansion Brightlands Kappa @towelliee
[2:30:52] j_bar111: Think they will do traps like in ICC? LUL
[2:30:53] xluckydawgx: the inbetween stuff
[2:30:55] luckfore: yea its icc/thorgast
[2:30:55] mavericks312: could be syvannas's escape
[2:30:57] SmokedHog: so world first will be RNG anima power to world first
[2:30:57] moonscryer: all those pathways scream "trash for days"
[2:31:02] yunggluten: Hot Tub room
[2:31:10] Avinar: I wonder if this will wrap up a lot of maw stuff and we fight jailer somewhere else
[2:31:22] kodtheog: its very basic
[2:31:27] cruzeal: that raid is blech
[2:31:28] Yagr6: but if the fights are fun and good tho
[2:31:30] Shrenko: wont you see the raid tomorrow?
[2:31:36] SpoonManes: no ooooh factor
[2:31:39] ravenoushydra: what if we fight the jailer in nagrand POGGERS
[2:31:41] luckfore: the new dungeon looks amazing tho
[2:31:49] raldrik: towUnforch
[2:31:51] Shrenko: towUnforch
[2:32:00] Lexi__Marie: "so there is no pleasing you"
[2:32:01] j_bar111: I forgot to do my blanchy daily yesterday ;(

[2:32:18] Shrenko: true LUL
[2:32:21] pavepawns: well nyalotha wrathion first time worked fine
[2:32:26] OigreSier: ofc is dark... is a death expansion Kappa
[2:32:28] Dimitrios90: esfandCozy
[2:32:31] SSD511_: I have hope on dreamhaven if  It’s the game make me stop wow
[2:32:35] shookhunty: For the raid, it makes sense it looks like Torghast cuz thats where Sylvanas is hiding. I liked that room with the statues, that had some modifcation.
[2:32:52] yshtola1337: @Towelliee  good morning when they doing raid testing on ptr
[2:32:54] OigreSier: dead
[2:32:56] Dimitrios90: @OigreSier  dead expansion Kappa
[2:32:57] pavepawns: im pretty sure maut was the buggy one
[2:33:06] pavepawns: cause i had no issues with wrathion
[2:33:13] bruhSit_farmer: nyalotha was a very nice unique raid imo
[2:33:15] FresheFefe: clearly played to much rhorgast in the beta
[2:33:40] SmokedHog: they could have changed the colors of the floors, make them red or blue or something to make it seem different
[2:33:45] SmokedHog: or make the sky black
[2:33:46] yshtola1337: i honestly dont think sylvanas is gonna be off'd
[2:34:18] Lexi__Marie: marrowgar, everywhere
[2:34:20] warrenny: An£ then 5 years later still. Farming your like yeah whatever @towelliee

[2:34:36] elitepower97: Just hope 9.1 will be worth the wait..
[2:34:47] bhxkazzam1: you are spot on
[2:34:55] BigCarlM: sounds like you are enjoying yourself
[2:34:58] Shrenko: I felt that in Legion and MOP too... too much FEL and Sha corruption stuff for way too long
[2:34:59] yunggluten: KT sounds like a really cool fight at least
[2:34:59] ColdChillXI: grey scale
[2:35:03] SpoonManes: there should be a quest to bring life into the shadowlands!
[2:35:09] MrClaudeSeaburn: KT fight seem to be really nice
[2:35:10] bruhSit_farmer: 9.1 wont be worth the wait lets be honest, but itll still be content ..
[2:35:15] Mecabeast: different every boss is fun but really hard it'll be worth it
[2:35:24] byrdeen45: sorry i just think shadowlands are boring raids are ok but most of it is boring as hell
[2:35:53] spekktrum19: I feel like sylvanas will “die” at the end of the raid but we won’t kill her- the jailer will probably send Anduin to kill her when we get her down to 5% or something
[2:35:54] Lexi__Marie: i would say if you dont enjoy the look of the raid take the tier off LUL
[2:36:00] Kyrrua: ppl always think a next wow big patch to come will fix the game
[2:36:04] elitepower97: WE NEED SOMETHING to grind for in 9.1 man i miss bfa right now !
[2:36:08] DreamWebb: making unique assets is hard , the live team after the initial development is probbaly much smaller , other team is probably already concepting / developing the next xpac
[2:36:12] Stargazer27: and it will be 10bosses raid again ResidentSleeper. I like it about 6-8 bosses
[2:36:30] warrenny: Deathrius was good
[2:36:36] TheHardcorian: Do you think 9.1 will bring alot of players back? interested after your video
[2:36:42] yunggluten: @elitepower97 there's tons of stuff to grind for out right now. What do you mean?
[2:36:44] zqoz: what yo do in that place
[2:36:48] MrGattz: they were working on 10.0 well before covid even hit
[2:36:53] kodtheog: what if they push back more content LUL
[2:37:05] eldacal: prediction: 10.0 is gonna be named Back to Pandaria
[2:37:06] MrKhanes: I bet the next expansion will more far off then usual.
[2:37:15] falldrgn: Imean I am fairly certain 10. is in development.. like story board.. and early concepts
[2:37:16] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:37:18] dalaraz: i think the solution , is the od solution. shadowlands stops at 9.2 to catch up @Towelliee
[2:37:18] Frank4LuLz: shadowlands RIP
[2:37:19] Lexi__Marie: wouldnt they want their numbers focusing on 9.1 no matter how long it takes
[2:37:23] luckfore: 9.3 will be cut i think
[2:37:23] Shrenko: I allready ditched it LUL
[2:37:28] brarker: hello!
[2:37:34] elitepower97: @yunggluten  What anima? thats not worth the grind right now lmao
[2:37:35] painzx123: When will the PTR 9.1 raid available?
[2:37:35] spekktrum19: SL is seeming to be a bridge-xpac to 10.0
[2:37:36] Osowareru: "At 10% health remaining, The Jailer removes Anima Powers from all players" Does it mean we'll find Anima powers throughout the raid?
[2:37:36] bruhSit_farmer: 10.0 will be a continuation of the shadowlands theme imo
[2:37:40] Cafe0le: will we have a miniraid ?
[2:37:41] Frank4LuLz: covid  deaths
[2:37:47] kodtheog: i would love a new engine
[2:37:49] Frank4LuLz: sucks
[2:37:51] SmokedHog: wow 2 , 1.0
[2:37:52] kodtheog: that would be amazing
[2:37:53] yunggluten: @elitepower97 then what are you asking for? You asked for a grind, that's a grind
[2:37:59] kodtheog: thats what the game needs tbh
[2:37:59] vilespine: because a lot left
[2:38:02] Mynth0l: Sl gonna be same as wod
[2:38:03] codedizle: 10.0 add housing please highly doubtful tho LUL a man can dream

[2:38:48] Stargazer27: @codedizle and the dance studio, yeah, we remember
[2:38:48] elitepower97: A grind that goes towards my player power ? @yunggluten
[2:38:49] Bowyn_: it's not anima power it's womanima power c'mon
[2:38:53] Osowareru: at 10% the real encounter begins so to speak
[2:38:53] onyx_pupper: blizzard cant afford ot lose devs so i dont think it was in that department

[2:39:45] yunggluten: @elitepower97 so you want AP to come back? That sounds awful. I dont want to feel like I have to play 60 hours a week to keep up and get invites to raids
[2:39:48] Vivelli: yea the media gobbles up any big staffing changes for blizz
[2:40:04] dillapuss: They will probably have predetermined anima powers in the trash then role specific that aren’t random unlike torghast

[2:42:09] cruzeal: wod happened and we got the masterpiece legion
[2:42:24] Phoxzy: @ogelly thank you thank you.
[2:42:38] pavepawns: i liked wod cause all i did was raid and relax
[2:42:45] Enigmio: rip faralon
[2:42:49] Alienfromger: bcause they new devs are cheaper than the old ones exbcSmart
[2:42:49] NoSingularity: we are the testers for new staff KEKW
[2:42:50] Caanan20: to be fair though the WoD Raids were Fire
[2:42:55] No_Panda: @pavepawns same
[2:42:56] SmokedHog: the worst version of wow is better than every other MMO lol
[2:42:59] Kromede: pepeMeltdown
[2:43:05] DreamWebb: maybe they spread their staff to thin with D4, D2 remake , Classic and BC etc etc
[2:43:05] Zettabyte: pepeMeltdown
[2:43:08] codedizle: as a casual player housing would be great would be cool like Gattz said if they added a construction profession, you could collect shit build stuff for your place. Idk but I would love that LUL

[2:43:50] zqoz: what the heck is this place
[2:43:53] Caanan20: final boss in DS was a pretty big let down
[2:43:56] ravenoushydra: molten core
[2:43:58] dalaraz: eh sanquine :p
[2:43:59] warrenny: Eternal palace ? uldir?
[2:44:00] tloh: mythic makes dgs so lame :<
[2:44:01] OceanManCarter: so true
[2:44:04] Shrenko: they base it on how it works in M+
[2:44:19] othraerir: towUnforch
[2:44:20] spekktrum19: towUnforch
[2:44:22] lanara233: true
[2:44:28] Koolsouthpaw: the affixes and the loot that drops people judge to see if its worth running
[2:44:35] SonofHorus82: @codedizle I would love it if they added a woodcrafting profession. They could make Bows and Crossbows, but also make crafting mats for other professions. The big thing that's missing with professions for me is that there's no real interaction between the professions anymore.
[2:44:36] dalaraz: i dont like how they desing dungeons based on what will happen on +25 later on @Towelliee
[2:44:36] Balkidar: Big true
[2:44:42] DreamWebb: crucible of storms DansGame
[2:44:45] TeeTimeGamer: What is your overall least favorite dungeon?
[2:44:47] Mecabeast: I think design wise all the dungeons we have so far feel unique but more than half feel like shit when you add affixs
[2:44:49] Ambersulfr: I didn't know you could kill this over and over and still get a mount chance.
[2:44:52] Stargazer27: random pulls through the floors
[2:44:52] Lexi__Marie: nono it sucked cause things pull through the walls and the ceiling
[2:44:54] AlbinoOprah: People hated Tol Dagor because of all the bugs in there.
[2:44:54] Caanan20: ruby sanctum was a goofy raid
[2:44:55] BossBuzz: for me tol dagor was bad cause it was buggy all the way through
[2:45:01] scrribbles: dont forget pulling through walls in Tol Dagor
[2:45:04] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee  why do you think blizz is dropping the ball on such a cash cow like wow? whos fault is it you think?
[2:45:06] warrenny: Tbh toldagor cool idea kinda sucked on keys 3rd boss ugh
[2:45:09] codedizle: @sonofhorus82 that would be cool and yeah I agree
[2:45:46] ahla03: Saying it sucks for gameplay reason is valid as well I feel, some dungeons just don't work with affixes

[2:45:56] MistaHat: Yeah Covid isnt making the call on conduit energy
[2:45:57] Caanan20: I wish they would remake the Wrath Dungeons and set them up for mythic or do like mythic timewalking? that would be really cool, I loved the dgs in Wrath
[2:46:08] Frank4LuLz: zoom calls

[2:47:38] Reap14: This is a WoW channel. FFXIV talk is forbidden here.
[2:47:39] yunggluten: can that be the new sub notification?
[2:47:39] swordwindgaming: FF14 dev team moved back into corp hq, Blizzard dev team is still WFH
[2:47:41] Noirmata: Imagine playing shadowlands
[2:47:41] codedizle: ff14 far from sucks LUL but they had their issues ya
[2:47:41] WhiteKnight74648: I'm having a blast with 5.5 in ff xiv and 5.55 should be coming out next month with additional content
[2:47:45] Avinar: all that content like... a few raids and boring bozja that's basically fates. and a alliance raid that the entire aesthetics is basically a lack of assets LUL
[2:48:07] Yagr6: they try to cater to casuals and they have lost their ideals for the game in the first place
[2:48:17] Avinar: xiv had 6+ months of a dry spell also Japan, if you look into it. didn't really go into a lock down like us
[2:48:18] RocketMan23: we dont know that though, thats just speculation
[2:48:23] SonofHorus82: @Xehanort1986 go and google where Square Enix HQ, where Blizzard HQ is, and then compare Covid stats for the 2 areas.
[2:48:27] 91Niki: Wait a min-- it doesn't = 3?? huh 🤔 Kappa
[2:48:31] codedizle: I can't wait for ff14 stardew valley like system LUL

[2:48:48] 91Niki: You just described my life. thanks Towelliee Kappa LUL
[2:48:50] warrenny: Ppl unfairly judge blizzard alot @towelliee
[2:48:52] swordwindgaming: FF14 dev team explained they tried to WFH but the data transfer rates were terrible and affected the pace of work - so they moved back into HQ with beefed up conditions
[2:48:56] RaidbossTV: or would we PogChamp
[2:49:01] techdough: I've heard this explained by @Towelliee  at least once already.
[2:49:04] StureNorth: I think the problems lays with blizzard paying slave wages.
[2:49:04] lanara233: True. I'm at work right now. Do I seem like I'm going full throttle? :)
[2:49:11] Arbszy: @swordwindgaming Exactly
[2:49:14] DigiSeven: a lot of people changing from in office to remote work changes the logistics of how things get done.
[2:49:17] TheHardcorian: reddit post incoming LuL
[2:49:19] shale93: thats what I do when working from home so I expect them doing the same Kappa
[2:49:23] Yagr6: @mavericks312 yes but causals come and go from any game... they need to just make a good expansion
[2:49:24] Arbszy: Also Japan Work culture is so different from US / Cali
[2:49:34] codedizle: ^
[2:49:36] Frank4LuLz: 9.3....plus more mounts to buy
[2:49:39] rhadds: rhadds subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:49:47] Arbszy: ffxiv patch content are so spread out
[2:49:47] WhiteKnight74648: No?
[2:49:51] Caanan20: If I got paid moneys to look at doggo pics all day I would be soooo happy.... wait IM on unemployment and doing that now, dreams do come true!
[2:49:54] Reap14: XIV doesn't focus on raid content only.
[2:49:59] WhiteKnight74648: Crafting content just came out as well
[2:50:00] MleveK: Yes but their consistency is still there though. Covid or no Covid.
[2:50:02] WhiteKnight74648: New mounts
[2:50:03] TastieLP: !Room
[2:50:04] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:50:07] takebushi: 4 bosses, 6 encounters
[2:50:08] WhiteKnight74648: New housing items
[2:50:09] remixonfire91: This FFxiv patch was just filler content
[2:50:10] xluckydawgx: https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/6526ce95a595e8a557b55736f85f19687dc11883
[2:50:12] tloh: oh shit 9.1 we getting 2 raids?
[2:50:21] Arbszy: You get 2nd half of it in 6 weeks, yet people bitch when blizz gates content for like a week or 2.
[2:50:22] SmokedHog: this is actually good content
[2:50:23] 91Niki: Also, it is two completely different games. Two different set of codes, different server setups. You can't just compare games like that.
[2:50:23] Lemonsqze: Pog
[2:50:25] Kromede: mamaaa uuuWWWuuu
[2:50:25] laughing_octopus: i bet its 4 bosses

[2:50:29] DreamWebb: i dont believe the wouldnt of had this content already completed even before SL launch
[2:50:29] Caanan20: I like the 2-4 boss raids we get, or "mini raids"
[2:50:31] Secondbreakfasttt: towLul towLul

[2:50:42] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:50:44] Reap14: They could remove it from the game
[2:50:44] FresheFefe: like an angel
[2:50:45] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™

[2:50:47] ravenoushydra: I mean we're not even getting that on wow LUL
[2:50:52] Zettabyte: UwU
[2:50:55] TMMOOF: Did you ever get on the Valheim train @Towelliee ?
[2:50:58] Caanan20: I want more of those, they're fast and I dont feel like Ive gotten no where after 4 hours and getting only 2 kills lol
[2:50:58] Eviltuna13: Wow patches would be faster if the didn’t have to keep balance every class
[2:50:59] Cisco_CWF: the fact is ff14 has its audience and wow has its own for the gameplay systems they focus on sure there some people who like both and thats fine but there also a case to each there own for what they want
[2:51:07] Avinar: player housing for all hat can get one
[2:51:08] swordwindgaming: WoW got housing already, its called WoD garrisons LUL
[2:51:14] Aedarax: covenant quests x4
[2:51:14] No_Panda: new m+ affix
[2:51:18] Kromede: wow is so boring for me atm i play Black Desert Mobile FeelsBadMan
[2:51:18] MleveK: @91Niki No but you can compare consistency within themselves
[2:51:25] ahla03: do you really think class changes take THAT much dev time ?
[2:51:27] codedizle: @swordwindgaming that's not housing
[2:51:27] SonofHorus82: @Knocx because dumb people keep trying to use it as evidence that wow devs are just being lazy and not taking any other factors in to account.
[2:51:28] KaisenSiru: YEP
[2:51:31] bhxkazzam1: but all those features and those decision, its like digging there own grave, why 4 difficulty?
[2:51:32] Reap14: @Towelliee Until you participate in XIV end game I don't think you can make a comparison
[2:51:35] Ceredor1: retuning all the dungeons to compensate for the new gear too.  There's so much in a WoW patch now you can't compare.
[2:51:44] ArcaneSyntax: ffxiv doesnt even do full raids most of the time, they do 4 boss rooms that arent even connected
[2:51:46] kurimaydie: i wish ff14 had m+ and better dungeon design
[2:51:48] Ceredor1: Even to previous WoW patches like Wotlk.
[2:51:56] chronoit: but like most of the content you just named is just busywork. More isnt' necessarily a good thing
[2:51:57] Lexi__Marie: @Towelliee look at everything you just listed and ask yourself you really gonna be upset its taking so long for this patch to go live
[2:51:57] burnunit_: I'll never play FF14 or a square game again after they decided to keep charging my sub after i cancelled for months and had to get the bank involved to get my money back.
[2:51:58] gajoxi: HAFACTUAL
[2:51:58] othraerir: don't forgot all the new cosmetics ;)
[2:52:00] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Cafe0le (warning)
[2:52:03] 91Niki: @MleveK No, you can't. It's different companies, different amount of people assigned to things. Different setups within the company. You can't
[2:52:05] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee I think the best thing that could happen to wow would be some actual competition to light a fire under the devs lol
[2:52:06] SmokedHog: no DPS meters in FF14
[2:52:09] CandyCaneCarl: also the billion second GCD, and dealing with weebs
[2:52:10] luckfore: 9.1 is mostly copy/paste from other expacs
[2:52:11] HAMMERRAZOR: hey towelliee hey chat
[2:52:17] RobbayGaming: watch it towlie FF!4 players can get pretty defensive lol
[2:52:24] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee i think we can agree that type of content between ff xiv is WoW is very different. people enjoy different things
[2:52:26] Caanan20: Sadge

[2:52:38] Reap14: @RobbayGaming WoW players aren't?
[2:52:51] SmokedHog: Idk.. I need my dps meters
[2:52:51] Caanan20: is there a towPrayge
[2:52:56] Yagr6: even casuals are leaving the game... wow has major issues
[2:52:58] Kinghorn: towUnforch
[2:53:01] bruhSit_farmer: cant prove weebs wrong
[2:53:03] laughing_octopus: @Reap14 nope we shit on wow daily
[2:53:06] Sir_Kerrai: Shit.. is a very good word for it :D
[2:53:07] CCG_337: FFXIV has more patches, so in the long run is alot of content as WOW becasue wow patch every six months, but that is something that you dont know really.
[2:53:12] swordwindgaming: FF14 patches are slices of pizza. WoW patches are the whole pizza, cheesesticks, and dipping sauce.
[2:53:13] bhxkazzam1: is big better though? id argue that
[2:53:14] soldi_26: i love WoW but i cant play it consistently. I capped my 3 toons got to 220+ilvl and then took a break. Havent played for about 2 months
[2:53:14] SonofHorus82: @RobbayGaming yeah weebs will mos def die to defend their pre-pubescent cat girls LUL

[2:53:39] MrKhanes: Dont forget the Casino @Towelliee Panda was so hooked on that hahah!
[2:53:42] Vivelli: yet alot of ppl complain there isnt anything to do in WoW
[2:53:45] Kinghorn: ffxiv patches have more story than whole WoW expansions
[2:53:46] codedizle: ff14 has a better community LUL
[2:53:48] Reap14: You are welcome to stay ignorant though in your WoW bubble
[2:53:49] Avinar: eureka felt a bit better to me but bozja is just a few fates and really boring. only non raid /trial/dungeon thing they've added. xiv has really detailed fights that are a lot more in depth, just less of it.
[2:53:50] No_Panda: I'm currently on Denatrius mythic so I have stuff to do in wow for atleast a month
[2:53:57] WhiteKnight74648: I enjoy the music as well.
[2:54:01] laughing_octopus: @Kinghorn thats actual bs lol
[2:54:04] Lemonsqze: ffxiv crafting Kreygasm

[2:55:30] MleveK: So much WoW content while 2 days ago complaining SL had nothing to do in it. LOL
[2:55:34] kodtheog: Why does it seem like wow expansions are becoming less content now tho
[2:55:35] Salfurium: wait one can enjoy multiple things at the same time? And see weaknesses and strengths in products?
[2:55:40] CandyCaneCarl: they are worse than wows lol. imagine this wait we are in for 9.1 multiplied for 3 or 4
[2:55:42] Ambersulfr: @hjo1992 yea, it's small viewer for the most part but they do.
[2:55:42] HAMMERRAZOR: overall wow is just a bigger game and has 15 years worth of content, of course patches are going to be bigger
[2:55:44] codedizle: yes wow patches are way bigger
[2:55:53] laughing_octopus: @Kinghorn no fking dies in ffxiv

[2:57:22] mrpresbaby: Max said Trill will get a break now
[2:57:25] Avinar: pvp in xiv is just win trading to get the outfits
[2:57:30] laughing_octopus: @hjo1992 they tried to put pvp ffxiv but no playus it

[2:57:55] thunder993: short term it will be worth it for pve players, long term pve gear is better
[2:58:02] MleveK: @TheHardcorian They can, but no PVP player is going to say they loved the changes.
[2:58:04] Reaghol: @codedizle they are talkin about the patch that just released, which i did in a day... and arr isnt a patch its several compilled.
[2:58:12] Mecabeast: pvp gear scales up 13 ilvls in pvp so won't be as good in raid. probably won't change much for world first race
[2:58:22] Ambersulfr: I wish WoW had a bard-like class.
[2:58:23] TheHardcorian: @MleveK stats for that?
[2:58:29] dalaraz: @MleveK why would a pvp only player care bout what happens outside of pvp ? :S
[2:58:47] SonofHorus82: @Ambevsulfr dude same. I would play that in a heart beat.

[2:59:22] SonofHorus82: @NexusOps Classic MoP beta.
[2:59:30] dalaraz: @MekChopperDiaries maybe yes,maybe not,maybe its pov
[2:59:31] Daggerstry: I wonder how you become a game master for WoW and if you can do it from your home lol
[2:59:35] Mecabeast: the real toxic players are the ones trying to justify m+ being harder than other content and should have better rewards
[2:59:37] NexusOps: @91Niki ok that makes more sense. Thank you
[2:59:46] codedizle: both games are good wow and ffxiv both games has it flaws no game is perfect
[3:00:34] WhiteKnight74648: @Towelliee I really think WoW and  FFXIV are only the same in regards that they are MMOs.  It really depends on the person on what game they want to play.
[3:00:35] Avinar: I do wish xiv gearing was more fun though. it's rather boring and stats aren't much different if you can use it. it's either tome or 1 of 4 raid fights for bis. that's all you do for gear every 6 months with dungeons feeling unrewarding. I do enjoy both games but it frustrates me in what xiv is lacking and what they focus on with rp and crafting stuff so much
[3:00:50] dalaraz: @MleveK btw if you think 2400 is harder than killing last boss in mythic raid you are false
[3:00:57] MleveK: @dalaraz You're obviously not a PVP Player. You still have to get Anima, WQ, Maw, Torghast.....
[3:01:15] Arbszy: People love to endlessly defend a game. Enjoy what you like, I'm enjoying ffxiv more right now and will pop into WoW whenever I have that itch.
[3:01:27] MleveK: @dalaraz No it actually is. Unless you're playing with weebs. then yeah telling them to stop standing in fire is hard sure.
[3:01:30] dalaraz: yes you have to play the game yeah,i know.i dont peve @MleveK

[3:01:35] 91Niki: @Arbszy Preach!
[3:01:47] vluggejaapie89: how many attempts for the onyx serpent? @Towelliee
[3:01:47] WhiteKnight74648: I respect it :-)
[3:01:58] falldrgn: Nice add timing hahahah
[3:02:01] Avinar: I never cared for crafting and xiv crafting is often just macros so not a bug deal

[3:05:38] porowozek: is it Star Citizen of MMOs? KEKW
[3:05:54] 91Niki: This sounds about as bad as that whole Adobe deal with the 300 dollars unsub fee LUL
[3:06:05] 91Niki: that was a dumpster fire
[3:06:11] othraerir: for 500 you'd wanna get lifetime sub
[3:06:16] sinlesssinner: its like loot boxes, if ppl pay for em more power to the big companies for making ppl pay for stupid shit like that
[3:06:22] KageToraTS: Is he in the process of moving?
[3:06:28] codedizle: yeah I have that one too
[3:06:30] CaptainJoeyNY: heard the owner/creator was a millionaire, why the fuck he need 500 bucks for alphas?

[3:06:46] KageToraTS: ah okay thanks @HaxzorJimDuggan

[3:08:25] Arbszy: @kage AoC
[3:08:25] xluckydawgx: Yeah im good, like thats a waste of time
[3:08:30] cruzeal: too fucking long
[3:08:31] Arbszy: @KageToraTS AoC
[3:08:40] Arbszy: Ashes of Creation
[3:08:40] KageToraTS: what's that stand for sorry
[3:08:42] obelisk1151: i mean i sounds cool if they have good character progression
[3:08:42] Avinar: why not just be max level then
[3:08:49] KageToraTS: Ah okay thanks @Arbszy
[3:08:52] Arbszy: o7
[3:08:53] SonofHorus82: How long do you think it will be until AoC ends up as a FtP with a Facebook ad? 2 months?
[3:08:53] Thoreya: this why i stick to wow. lol
[3:08:58] Avinar: so there's not really an end game but a milestone?
[3:09:02] Thoreya: aint nobody got that for that
[3:09:09] Thoreya: got time*
[3:09:15] stefan4dawn: eyooo @towelliee and chat <3 GlitchCat
[3:09:17] xluckydawgx: no one has that time anymore not even streamers
[3:09:22] othraerir: would have been perfect during covid, not now though
[3:09:29] NexusOps: sounds like another "Wildstar - we don't cater to casuals" BS.
[3:09:32] sinlesssinner: no one is going to dethrone WoW, not until they understand why WoW is still popular.
[3:09:36] CaptainJoeyNY: remember all the "elite questing areas" in TOR, ended up being a waste of space after the leveling mob passed through
[3:09:56] Avinar: depends on how they do it and if they want to change people's perception of leveling not just a rush to max. it could pull off in a neat way but probably won't pan out because you'd need a lot of content while leveling
[3:10:10] wolfbane200ser: K let’s just bury AoC and save ourselves the trouble
[3:10:38] panzmat: Do we know when raid will be out in PTR?
[3:10:39] byrdeen45: looks nice
[3:10:43] Avinar: bears
[3:10:49] 91Niki: Buuuurrrs

[3:11:19] yunggluten: WOW WHAT AN MMO
[3:11:24] mavericks312: combat looks horrible
[3:11:24] Mecabeast: something like spawning in 5k bears
[3:11:25] Ceredor1: totally worth $500....
[3:11:29] Thoreya: it really doesnt look all that lol
[3:11:29] Jame20009: Russians DansGame

[3:11:35] MistaHat: AGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEED TY!!!!!!!!!
[3:11:38] pavepawns: the end of ashes is just a bunch of bears
[3:11:38] remixonfire91: graphics and combat are meh
[3:11:55] Navaeir: combat looks shit.. a bit like ESO - not a big fan
[3:11:57] GRVPHX: yea char movement needs to be smooth asf or it always feels just "off"
[3:12:04] Sh4nti: Yikes
[3:12:07] Avinar: the animations looked off. even the combat. it was jank
[3:12:07] BraerHZ: The rigging isn't great.
[3:12:07] Jame20009: It has WOW movements
[3:12:08] Roaringkittylol: Character models need to be bigger and more heroic... sorry but WoW does character models well. Beefy
[3:12:15] CaptainJoeyNY: my issue with terras was abiltiies had crazy anime animations that took 3-5 seconds to finish
[3:12:30] pavepawns: i dont like the crazy animations when u use abilities
[3:12:33] pavepawns: its too much
[3:12:46] 91Niki: @Towelliee Did you see the dumpster fire about Adobe charging someone 300 dollars for unsubbing from their annual service ? LUL
[3:12:47] CaptainJoeyNY: yeah, I like that WoWs moves are quick
[3:12:53] Avinar: well if it feels good, that's at least something because the rest can be changed
[3:12:57] ExtreemeCheese: Why do you think it's so hard for developers to make a successful mmorpg?
[3:13:11] Ceredor1: Kinda like USA mens soccer.  Great facilities, play like ass.
[3:13:19] BraerHZ: I like the vanilla WoW combat animations more than the post-legion ones. Everything got too compound and flashy and lost its 'weight'
[3:13:22] Jame20009: What is soccer?
[3:13:27] Sh4nti: TBF animations can be updated... if they really want and put in the effort
[3:13:34] CaptainJoeyNY: in terms of fluidity andmovement, Wildstar was on point
[3:13:45] Raugdel: soccer KKona

[3:14:58] DreamWebb: beta means feature complete they wouldnt show gameplay for like 10 years LUL
[3:15:00] obelisk1151: cant wait for new world
[3:15:09] byrdeen45: ya was fun
[3:15:11] khronick1904: new world is pretty fun
[3:15:15] soysos91: probably why WoW didn't release 9.1 PTR until it was "playable" for testing
[3:15:19] soysos91: or else people will poop on it
[3:15:24] khronick1904: been in alpha since November
[3:15:24] Victem: New World went back into Alpha after the Preview too.  Didn't even go into Beta.  And they have changed and added a bunch of stuff in it since.
[3:15:31] Avinar: new world is looking better from the alpha testing going on. just needs content
[3:15:41] Doedje: Thats why we get empty husks of games these days
[3:15:48] Avinar: there should be a new huge mid month patch too.
[3:15:52] Sproogles: spent like 6 hours questing in blasted lands earlier for one level shit is killing me @Quimby54
[3:15:59] filos0phia: valheim is the perfect example of how to do early access
[3:16:02] classictwo: aerietv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! good luck on dino!
[3:16:10] filos0phia: solid systems but little content
[3:16:11] dalaraz: i see "early access" as a way for companies to release unfinished game and get money earlier than it being actually early access
[3:16:13] codedizle: is new world still very pvp heavy? because I remember not really being interested cuz that's what it seemed it all was.
[3:16:14] remixonfire91: i remember when GW2 betas started to come out , they were buggy if you could tell the game was pretty much finished the first time i did WvW was a amazing experience
[3:16:21] TheRiwen: @Avinar New world look most as a pvp mmo
[3:16:22] Stargazer27: I think Diablo2 alpha was a success
[3:16:25] MistaHat: well it's because Early Access games have been pushed to "release" status and no impactful changes for months. so people naturally think, "Early access is something we will have for months to the first year"
[3:16:32] TombStoneMercenary: Thats on us as gamers for letting this early access BS be a thing though......
[3:16:38] yerdlethespaceturtle: @Sproogles check out searing gorge and ungoro crater. try to get to 52 and look for BRD arena runs groups.
[3:16:39] MrKhanes: @codedizle They have added a lot of pve stuff and you can op out from pvp aswell
[3:16:45] Reap14: Even if the game was phenomenal you would still say WoW is better, yes?
[3:17:15] WarriorMuffins: wildstar xD
[3:17:16] Frank4LuLz: WILDSTAR

[3:18:48] Navaeir: imagine thinking world content is everything
[3:18:51] ahla03: @Towelliee why do you not stream them? I saw on preach stream that he was afraid wow was kinda getting stale so he wanted to do variety content more
[3:18:53] Kromede: i loved the zone events in RIFT
[3:18:55] Avinar: I'd love eso more if their combat wasn't so... sloppy
[3:18:55] corncob78: YO did you see the new "with the next pick" for colts?

[3:48:58] DreamWebb: like those stygia expoiters they got forgotten about didnt they LUL
[3:48:58] Frank4LuLz: PR BS
[3:49:04] PvtHudson093: i thought it fell apart
[3:49:06] Arbszy: They prbly ended it because of the deer person
[3:49:09] Wildside1177: It was infested with woke idiots and went nowhere.
[3:49:10] Frank4LuLz: Optics Bs
[3:49:10] alex12645: the council of no power
[3:49:13] PvtHudson093: because of deer lady
[3:49:16] thiccsushi: the toxic deer person killed it i think
[3:49:18] Shrenko: catJAM
[3:49:23] Holysal: well one of the members started hating on all the viewers
[3:49:32] Venkxx: well, seeing how weird the people of this council were it would have been a bad pr stunt
[3:49:46] MrGattz: apparently the counsel is still going but they dont have any say in what to ban and what not to ban @Towelliee they are just there to make sure twitch has someone to go to if they feel they need to change something significant without pissing off tons of people
[3:49:47] Frank4LuLz: ban incoming
[3:49:48] jxxpn: It is what it is BrokeBack
[3:49:50] Alepouditsa: what deer lady LUL
[3:49:56] JayKay_TV: Man screw dropped frames, an streamers that sub lock their vods.
[3:50:05] shavinglove: Hard to talk about because we are all walking on eggshells @Towelliee
[3:50:05] azzurrin: It's the WOKE culture
[3:50:05] JeemTeam: lol feelings
[3:50:09] filos0phia: I was just like "no way he's opening this can of worms" then you say "it's hard to talk about" lmao ikr
[3:50:15] JeemTeam: going to be the downfall of us
[3:50:23] TnTsKyHiGh: this "feelings" era is disgusting
[3:50:27] Wildside1177: They gave in to the wokeys who care  more about feelings than fact.
[3:50:30] I_DoctorSatan_I: well...that's millenials and zoomers for ya.
[3:50:30] Ysida: maybe because suicide numbers are raising?
[3:50:42] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: @towelliee i think it vanished after that the person who ided as a gay lesbian deer decided  it had more power then twistch
[3:50:47] Gurtington_: a world of not caring is bad but so is this current world of caring to much about every little thing :(
[3:50:53] Mecabeast: streamers are becoming the new age celebrities
[3:50:55] stallowned: they cater to large streamers too much thats why
[3:50:56] mangerw12: Hey @Towelliee, does the mount drop from the boss or is it inside that item you get from the boss?
[3:50:58] Frank4LuLz: Towellie friends more PC than the world
[3:51:02] DreamWebb: its called virtue signalling
[3:51:17] ZeethianDragon: "the rich get richer" twitches mindset
[3:51:26] Rastailian: the sad part is that twitch is slowly ghosting those same streamers now @towelliee
[3:51:31] I_DoctorSatan_I: BabyRage my feelings are hurt! TWITCH DO SOMETHING!! BabyRage
[3:51:31] xrandomdoodx: because they weren't politically forced to do so. just shows they only do it if they're forced to do it.
[3:51:33] xXSiebzehnXx: And then Twitch is the heroes. Everyone forgets before
[3:51:34] vaterX: yeah, it felt kind of weird having a race only section of twitch even if it was interesting
[3:51:37] king_julian_96: But yeah there is always a loophole the fact of the matter if someone finds a chance an exploit it’s gonna happen it’s just how people are today
[3:51:42] Alepouditsa: @JayKay_TV  yep
[3:51:46] Avinar: I disliked it because it's like "hey look we notice them" but it puts it on a platform
[3:51:52] aberlourspey: Can't shake those Justin.tv roots
[3:52:06] filos0phia: @Towelliee as opposed to what streaming platform? Do any have an "identity"?
[3:52:12] Frank4LuLz: WE ARE INDEPENDANT ENTERTAINERS/CREATORS
[3:52:13] snoopy123lol: what i dont understand is that european decent cannot say n word (which is right) but african decent can say n word. i saw a streamer who said n word 100time in minute
[3:52:15] dalaraz: they are constantly adapting to changes and thats the right thing to do
[3:52:19] Malnar1123: Is there maybe a benefit to that? That they don't define themselves hard and fast....it maybe makes a wider range of people feel welcome because there isn't a specifically defined culture
[3:52:20] Walk7301: Do you think overall twitch is in a better place now than it was 10-15 years ago?
[3:52:34] HaloS23: still think front page should be reserved for those worthy of it. not just because you fit some specific mind set imo
[3:52:43] sir_valorum: lock-up
[3:52:49] Yurian33: vested
[3:52:52] Arbszy: Reminds me of Blizzard Employees, Use to know so many, now that list is tiny.
[3:52:55] Frank4LuLz: vested
[3:53:00] EggwithEdges: Towelliee After Dark tho :(
[3:53:03] Shrenko: you are signed by Twitch!

[3:53:09] king_julian_96: Well I can’t blame them I would to if I had that kind of money
[3:53:37] Frank4LuLz: Twitch wont die, it will change, not die
[3:53:37] Ohdies: the only game that will kill wow is wow
[3:53:37] san_grax: Hey bro ! how is your nickname pronounced
[3:53:42] MrGattz: i just want a game streaming platform that isnt in the news for having "thots selling bathtub water for insane prices". its embarrassing saying im part of a twitch community to someone who has no idea what twitch is. you might as well say your part of a chaterbate community now.
[3:53:44] Walk7301: What would you change about the platform?
[3:53:47] Sh4nti: Youtube could if it put in the effort
[3:54:04] othraerir: just chaterbating ;)

[3:54:07] Doedje: Just chatting is just a camgirl platform
[3:54:14] I_DoctorSatan_I: weird...you can stream yourself doing drugs, but the second a nipple slips, your banned for 24-48 hrs.
[3:54:15] stallowned: i agree @MrGattz
[3:54:18] Doedje: gateway to camgirl sites
[3:54:20] yshtola1337: moon guard isnt that the heavy rp server
[3:54:20] SonofHorus82: remove Just Chatting all together and make someone choose an actual tag.
[3:54:26] dalaraz: @Doedje thats kinda unfair ,kinda
[3:54:34] NateChillyDog: doc
[3:54:36] vaterX: Towelliee do you have an onlyfans?
[3:54:37] Ysida: Youtube could just block re-streaming their content outside YT. Problem solved.
[3:54:41] thiccsushi: Just move the coomer content in their own 18+ section
[3:54:48] EggwithEdges: Ice Poseidon is there Kappa
[3:54:50] magemaster225: I like watching podcasts more on youtube than twitch

[3:55:04] capnkalland: No
[3:55:04] jiffynuts: I think for next year's april fools you should do a hot tub stream :D
[3:55:06] Sh4nti: Valkyrae & Drdisrespect
[3:55:20] agg_ie: or onlyfans could pick up on it, and start their own streaming service
[3:55:23] Poriand: Same
[3:55:25] I_DoctorSatan_I: Doc still laughing at Twitch though. Doc making more $$$ than he did at Twitch. Twitch = 2000 IQ LUL
[3:55:26] Sh4nti: @reportop they disabled it because of pedos (not even joking)
[3:55:27] Ohdies: can't you double dip and stream both simultaneously?? @towelliee
[3:55:28] agg_ie: wait thats called pron..my bad
[3:55:28] Legionnare92: he has irregular heartbeat so he cant play
[3:55:29] capnkalland: he can't play defense just the rest of the nets team lol
[3:55:32] Malnar1123: @Towelliee He had to leave a game the other day due to irregular heartbeat
[3:55:34] rillo5: if youtube actually had a decent way to see who’s streaming and directories it would be so much better
[3:55:35] Kromede: never watched, don't care
[3:55:38] Holysal: he does well on YouTube
[3:55:46] Sh4nti: Shunned LUL

[3:56:02] Frank4LuLz: ALEXSENSUAL, PANSER
[3:56:02] Mecabeast: how bout celebrities like Rhonda rousey streaming wow on facebook
[3:56:03] Kaihrn: Ninja Who??
[3:56:04] Chiraakitteh: You tube streaming isn’t as good for viewers, and it’s hard to get people to find you when you’re live, and you have to do a complicated setup for a live stream, instead of just starting your stream.
[3:56:07] reportop: @Sh4nti  wtf is wrong with people ..
[3:56:08] dalaraz: i kinda watched doc here and there but cba to open youtube
[3:56:14] Gurtington_: sounds like a gang. or a church
[3:56:16] capricore: That’s the Opposite of close lol
[3:56:21] vluggejaapie89: bc u get banned for it
[3:56:37] Holysal: theres BTTV emotes of doc
[3:56:40] Sh4nti: @reportop just some terrible people spoiling the internet :(
[3:56:50] DreamWebb: his streams have ~300k views thats still huge
[3:56:54] Chiraakitteh: And the mobile app for YouTube, you can’t minimize a window and look at other stuff... it’s just a much worse app for viewers
[3:56:57] Malnar1123: Aldridge...thats why he retired
[3:57:06] nintendyoh: @Towelliee is it generally accepted that Doc was banned so Twitch didn't have to pay him so Shroud and Ninja could come back to Twitch?
[3:57:13] Frank4LuLz: needs to switch to GFUEL
[3:57:21] nintendyoh: Lol
[3:57:22] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: @Towelliee doc just wrote a new book also
[3:57:29] Kyrrua: twitch is a family ?
[3:57:30] vaterX: @Chiraakitteh you can if you subscribe to youtube. i forget what they call it.
[3:57:39] Daggerstry: Imagine having to quit your job because of irregular heartbeat..... what a wimp
[3:57:52] Doedje: Maybe youtube has a "community" aswell, like we do on twitch
[3:57:54] vaterX: @Towelliee youtube streaming quality > twitch's
[3:58:02] Kromede: leaked twitch contract POGGERS

[3:58:23] Redbearded16: You’re my god damn dad
[3:58:24] fabrizioserra26: LUL
[3:58:29] rillo5: youtube needs a whole section for live streaming. It’s such a bad interface to find people and watch
[3:58:32] 無職提督: should ask for more
[3:58:37] XarkoLP: Even your funeral will be streaming on twich, i guess? Kappa
[3:58:39] Kaihrn: there is a few newer classic youtube guys stream on youtube and thye got around 600+ viewers now so not to bad

[3:58:50] reportop: yhe youtube lacks KEKW spam
[3:58:51] Sh4nti: It's just random emojis and people insulting on YT LUL
[3:58:55] 無職提督: i did, that yt chat is so bad
[3:58:55] jxxpn: YT algo favors drama, no secret
[3:59:02] Daggerstry: @I_DoctorSatan_I 27. Being in charge of nuclear plants with irregular heartbeat. A job deemed more stressful than his
[3:59:03] Wildside1177: I watch some live WWhisky channels on youtube and those are great. Gaming is probably different...heh.

[3:59:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: oh yea....every time WoW AWC or WoW MDI is on YT, the chat is ruthless.
[3:59:11] Enigmio: not always....docs youtube channel is like here...he got all his emotes
[3:59:24] aberlourspey: Agreed, YT chat is painful to look at
[3:59:25] rillo5: I’ve never kept a youtube chat open they’re so bad
[3:59:25] Vivelli: facebook i think does a bit better than youtube for community
[3:59:34] Avinar: yt needs bttv
[3:59:35] kokochris: yup twitch did that alot better
[3:59:40] Vivelli: ive only seen a few facebook streams tho
[3:59:55] 無職提督: i mean cmon, Google aint u all geniuses how hard is to comeup with a decent caht for yt
[3:59:56] Sproogles: toast

[4:00:18] Moobot: Towelliee is NOT moving or homeless. He is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The background will change, the stream will be scuffed, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[4:00:22] Sandman_88: ya, that hurt when Goth left
[4:00:23] xXSiebzehnXx: King Gothalion and Darkness429
[4:00:25] Sandman_88: felt betrayed
[4:00:38] Sandman_88: over it now of course
[4:00:44] othraerir: charlie murphy :)
[4:00:52] OceanManCarter: I miss Goth. He got to1 million followers then dipped like two weeks later
[4:01:03] Sh4nti: Soda lost 3 mill or smtng LUL
[4:01:04] vaterX: i think a big problem with competitor platforms is user experience. it's hard as hell to find live streams or streamers in general on most other platforms.
[4:01:10] Frank4LuLz: Soda
[4:01:12] Chiraakitteh: @vaterx I subscribed for a few months, and you can play the SOUND in the background, but you can’t minimize the window (ie player in player) and still have it going in a corner of your tablet whilst you look other stuff up or read.
[4:01:12] DreamWebb: imagine thinking streamers care about their viewers LUL
[4:01:21] Jango_: soda lost millions

[4:04:03] PopaChub101: @towelliee what is the command table addon?
[4:04:12] Ohdies: Wow.. since when does it play 7 adds in a row
[4:04:31] Frank4LuLz: @Towelliee  would it be worth it to start shadowlands now, asking for a friend, he plays FF14
[4:04:53] othraerir: we haven't had a warrior for most of it
[4:05:04] Doedje: 2 specs for dh is just crap tbh
[4:05:06] Gregadeaux: but then how would i get into raids
[4:05:15] Gregadeaux: my damage buff is all i bring
[4:05:15] thiccsushi: they need to remove it or spread it to all classes
[4:05:36] dimofodi: They need to provide the buffs to multiple clases so you're back to bring the player not the class. Back in MoP King and Mark of the Wild were the same buff etc.
[4:05:38] Gurtington_: I don't really want all classes to have everything tho
[4:05:48] pavepawns: it does
[4:05:48] parmesanchi: Wait didn't we want to stop the homogenization of classes?
[4:05:52] Ceredor1: It's a tough situation, if they moved the debuffs off the classes, the class would be replaced most likely with a meta.
[4:06:13] Gurtington_: I thought we did @parmesanchi
[4:06:28] Walk7301: It’s a ranged vs melee meta issue
[4:06:30] CallMeWallie: Aren’t hunters like really good for fights with high mobility though?
[4:06:56] Ragingfirebush: What do you think will be the best tank in 9.1? I know its early just curious

[4:12:38] K_A_N_J_I: Why bring melee when you can bring 4 hunters 5 fire mages, locks and bookies. The issue is ranged is super strong have immunities and utility and  are just overall better for most mechanics. If melee is not pumping out super damage and have no utility like a buff or cd use full to raid they won’t be attractive to bring to raids @towelliee
[4:12:50] Navaeir: man don't do it
[4:12:55] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee I have a raider.io question. Is there somewhere that I can go to see my own io? Or do I have to do something that counts in the io before any info will show up for me?
