[1:06:39] f1uxuate: hows your dragon class bro?
[1:06:42] Shipsternz: then again paying games now are bad too
[1:06:42] smilehyy: combat arms and project blackout is goated
[1:06:43] ericAtlas: @Tombodat untrue for MANY reasons
[1:06:44] dijonno: Battlefield heroes

[1:07:09] DeputyMJ: knight online was the first mmorpg ive played
[1:07:17] imMikeyAngelo: Any one from RydahMS in here
[1:07:17] anoqytheancient: what is the main objective in this game?
[1:07:22] SymphoniaIX: I think its because monetizing changed since then. Riot Games was a good pioneer on having a good model for monetizing f2p games

[1:07:55] legionwraithh: fornite Poggers
[1:07:56] centhic: Blacklight retribution was way ahead of its time
[1:07:56] E_Chonyay: Games like battlefront were so dumb because you paid for an ok game and then allll the micro transactions to get new weapons and characters killed it
[1:08:04] GanglesKahn: it was about 30
[1:08:10] ericAtlas: @zyriosgaming because when the game is F2P your data and time are what is being sold
[1:08:12] redstatue: 30 then dropped to 15
[1:08:14] Noobularr: i only remember it being like $20 or 30 brand new lol
[1:08:40] krarrr: you have to do that for the second quest

[1:14:07] fallenasu: i didn't. could only use the seahorse mount there. was annoying
[1:14:09] notvaksa: @KrankyKrankis free trial shows nothing for real, the fun begins when you are max level and well leveling can be fun later into the game in some zones

[4:31:48] iiiternal: h
[4:31:49] ChubbyMikey: frankly, if you haven't railed on wow, it's because you haven't played
[4:31:53] Kelisco: Cs can add a simple leaderboard to start off with then work to add more stuff
[4:31:56] grimcreaper: it seems like anyone who enjoys this expansion is basically coping over the money spent
[4:32:02] SimplyBlunt: @ChubbyMikey facts
[4:32:06] Cutencuddly73: @ChubbyMikey thats why blizzard devs dont railon wow
[4:32:10] TheRagingUnicorn: You can watch both, lol @thousandhour
[4:32:12] Cutencuddly73: cose they havent played LUL
[4:32:19] ChubbyMikey: @ThousandHour hey, drop it, we don't shit on other creators in here
[4:32:32] tarawr0: WoW is the best game I've ever hated
[4:32:40] grimcreaper: Blizzard has been awful for years.
[4:32:49] beckinsalex: wanna race to 70
[4:32:49] TheRagingUnicorn: He said drop it
[4:33:08] olomist: f
[4:33:10] ChubbyMikey: that was sort of simultaneous, so I let it pass
[4:33:18] Walker_Mcloud: enjoy the jourmey yo
[4:33:21] beckinsalex: thats a good question
[4:33:22] hzbba: !drop
[4:33:40] SimplyBlunt: its only when Blizzard became what they are today that people started hating. Most of us that played wow played back in its prime. and its heartbreaking to those with true passion for the game to see it become what it has. so i understand where he is coming from
[4:33:57] Joleil: Joleil subscribed with Prime. 
[4:34:00] ChocoFrieEcho: @shroud why u so dam fineeee

[4:34:13] TheRagingUnicorn: you right, you’re nicer than me in this instance KEKW @chubbymikey
[4:34:28] grimcreaper: i used to really love wow and blizzard games as a whole. the activision merger basically destroyed them as a company.
[4:34:42] ChubbyMikey: I'll give him another chance
[4:34:52] thenewguy176: sex number level? PogBones
[4:35:02] SimplyBlunt: in Chromie it does, outside of it i dont believe so
[4:35:12] Arcinatos: it used to in BFA but people hated it, scaled off of your ILVL
[4:35:16] FrCharm: is wow still pay monthly to play?
[4:35:23] grimcreaper: i dont think anyone knows what chubby is talking about
[4:35:27] ChubbyMikey: yes @FrCharm
[4:35:33] thenewguy176: now that the dust has settled, how was dragonflight?
[4:35:51] TheRagingUnicorn: I do @grimcreaper you just aren’t a knower KEKW
[4:35:55] matching_towels: Thank you for streaming
[4:36:13] grimcreaper: if i was a knower.. id know things!
[4:36:22] Capycap: @shroud font :)
[4:36:30] TheRagingUnicorn: Knowing things is exhausting, don’t become a knower
[4:36:42] FrCharm: is it 30 bucks a month?
[4:36:50] SimplyBlunt: $15
[4:37:06] ChubbyMikey: it's also corrupting, TRU. I didn't use to be such an asshole
[4:37:14] AgelessYamcha: WoW isnt launching for me
[4:37:20] grimcreaper: with the current state of the game, wow should be less than $5 a month and the expansion should  have been 15.
[4:37:30] Justrollin: @AgelessYamcha 1hr maintainance in eu
[4:37:40] lorkinas: try use the exe from wow folder directly instead of the battle net app
[4:37:44] TheRagingUnicorn: I believe it @chubbymikey I wasn’t always this mean LMAO
[4:37:50] lorkinas: try using i mean
[4:37:51] Cutencuddly73: @grimcreaper game should be free expansions hould stay same
[4:38:03] grimcreaper: true
[4:38:09] Cutencuddly73: the fact blizz use expansion + sub + in game cosmetics is kinda outdated but
[4:38:15] Cutencuddly73: its still working so why change it for them i guess
[4:38:20] AgelessYamcha: @AgelessYamcha im not in EU tho lol
[4:38:20] ImSkyHigh: thats why im a hunter. Havent died once and lv 68. Pet tanking hard EZ

Glad to have this game to distract me from life again

[7:08:54] sophix_hc: thats your choice then @hexedlotus , if you want a convenience or performance char. ench isnt bad either, gets you stats and stuff

[7:46:48] clones_2018: do evokers start at lvl 60 and could i play it right away if i bought the game?
[7:47:03] djkhaleddesciple: is dragon flight worth getting into if i have never played wow before?
[7:47:03] SirJonHopkins: @Vidraz dont forget them intellects and portal
[7:47:05] BruceRain: @clones_2018 58, and yes
[7:47:12] Vidraz: @HalcyonDaysof very true...
[7:47:18] djkhaleddesciple: is dragon flight worth getting into if i have never played wow before????

[7:47:39] nonreallity: whats with him and babys first its the baby shit now its the baby dck LUL
[7:47:39] shaun986: @clones_2018 your first Evoker (starts at 58), doesn’t have any restrictions. But after that, you need a 50 on the server to make one. (One Evoker per server)
[7:47:40] Kryptonite_122: @Dat__Matt pretty good time to start. levelling is fast and expansion is getting tons of good press
[7:47:41] Travmo4: baby dik damage lmaoo

[7:50:11] Beniamin: Is it too late to play this game? Kappa

[7:50:22] sophix_hc: cause the dwagons are big

[7:59:25] JARUM3: @clones_2018 people often say that in the honeymoon phase
[7:59:36] JARUM3: wow is always good when it launches
[7:59:41] treadly: How do I gift the two WOW subs?
[7:59:53] sageslayer: Every WoW expansion is fun for the first month or two
[7:59:56] osoi____: @JARUM3 bfa and shadowlands were not good from the start tho lol
[7:59:57] Keks4lol: I just want ret pala to be good again lul
[7:59:58] clones_2018: got any gut feeling about it though?
[8:00:02] DhouseGaming: WoW is the best game there is, when new xpac drops. ALWAYS. and if you disagreee, you probably play new world
[8:00:17] shaun986: @clones_2018 it has very high potential to be the best, but you have to wait a month to see if it holds up. but still, it doesn’t have any obvious flaws like the past several xpacs at launch
[8:00:21] miguelito420: Pepega
[8:00:27] yeheyyehey: invoker
[8:00:31] JARUM3: @osoiiiii I liked SL the first two weeks, didn't play BFA in the start but every other xpac was great in the beginning
[8:00:35] smashkan: should kite him around the circle you just cleared
[8:00:36] m24master: CR him justin
[8:00:37] brand0nhxc: ok
[8:00:37] DhouseGaming: evoker is an immediate problem in pvp
[8:00:38] sageslayer: @JARUM3 Shadowlands was praised at the start especially with the Denathrius raid. It was fun for the first month or so
[8:00:42] Im_The_Map_LoL: just move around the room
[8:00:51] Ciaaattt: @JARUM3 at the start, a lot of people were hyping it up. I remember how crazy people praised on shadowlands
[8:00:57] ttvnotedfan: hi
[8:01:00] Monstersnus: BFA and Shadowlands were decent in the start as every expac is, but they had obv flaws. So far dragonflight does not have that IMO
[8:01:05] amir______________: That's the real invoker
[8:01:22] shaun986: shadowlands got so much praise because people were glad to be out of bfa lol
[8:01:27] JARUM3: I still think people were too tough on BfA I really liked Nyalotha

[8:05:17] SirJonHopkins: @JARUM3 on a serious note, you think they'll make BFA classic? KEKW
[8:05:18] Travmo4: @sageslayer agreed but for SL it was way more than the length of time between launch and the first patch. All the required grinds between Torghast, Covenants, and Legendary's were what made it so bad.
[8:05:29] Tha_Valkyrie: corruptions were terrible for the game
[8:05:31] Koffiekoekje: J9 dancing over there

[8:06:24] Fuzzytoaster888: just gift 2 subs to the channel
[8:06:26] Alaziara: You can firebreath at 1 stack, it'll do less initial dmg but dot dmg will be higher @shroud
[8:06:27] b_vern: @treadly its twitch subs not wow subs

[8:08:24] extr3me90: wait 2 min for lust
[8:08:28] dbgzx: is this normal or heroic??
[8:08:29] Baylel: deadly boss mods?
[8:08:29] AngeredLotus: same damage overall
[8:08:31] JARUM3: @halcyondaysof no WoD was way worse than SL there's no competition
[8:08:42] osoi____: learning POGGERS
[8:08:46] shayneeking: Yes
[8:08:49] waguiSan: no, always 1
[8:08:50] MurkinYuh: yeah
[8:08:50] AngeredLotus: firebreath one stack on long fights
[8:08:51] DhouseGaming: you only need to charge it if youre in pvp lol
[8:08:54] clones_2018: wod was so bad it wasnt even hardly an mmo
[8:08:56] jordeon123: Wait hes just now getting this KEKW Yay for learning Clap
[8:08:56] sanctumdieux: Firebreath with 1 stack on boss ...
[8:08:57] sageslayer: At least WoD was a good pvp gearing expansion
[8:08:59] DhouseGaming: it doesnty matter, its the same DMG overall
[8:08:59] Mormanisms: no, you want to fire breath full charge when things will die quick
[8:08:59] shayneeking: Period of time
[8:09:02] lucid41: it does for the instant living flame talent
[8:09:03] Wolfyo7: depends on how long the mobs will live
[8:09:04] Nab1337: max stacks if they wont live the dot period
[8:09:06] Mormanisms: then when its a long pull one charge
[8:09:12] Jeliefysh: More stacks when you can refresh the dot, or when they'll die before the dot finishes
[8:09:12] MurkinYuh: less dps for full charge
[8:09:13] Travmo4: id take WoD over SL any day
[8:09:20] sanctumdieux: the dot is bigger on first
[8:09:21] Alaziara: YEP
[8:09:23] HcNate: gotta interrupt the add
[8:09:29] dol4iua: its actual ?
[8:09:30] DhouseGaming: thats why you want to fire breathe first of all, and then rotation and then fire rbeathe full charge to finish the pack
[8:09:39] JARUM3: @halcyondaysof there's some videos explaining why WoD was so disappointing but there were massive content cuts and it blew up the economy
[8:09:40] sanctumdieux: firebreath max charged just take dot to insta damage instead
[8:09:41] AirbourneX99: It matters because of unnecessary longer casting time of fire breath
[8:09:43] Melevos: !drops
[8:09:44] MassiveRodx: doesnt fire guy explode where he dies?
[8:09:44] FlowsS_: fire breath 1 stack in aoe   and full stacks in single target
[8:09:48] DyingForPie21: in 2 weeks this fight is going to be a tank and spank 😊
[8:09:51] MassiveRodx: just kill him away from the group
[8:09:55] boats_bain: yewwww
[8:10:03] TheShivtyRogue: Its all about how long is the pack going to last, if its going to last a bit use the long dot, if not go for more upfrount damage

[9:05:16] PsyNytes: Might need to set up a link here for that schedule PauseChamp
[9:05:19] OptionalGames: @christopha_au yep just came out yesterday
[9:05:30] PsyNytes: @flashnickgg Yeah holidays and work kill me sometimes but I'll try to be here more consistently
[9:05:34] bnans: @PsyNytes Pog
[9:05:45] JerseyBricklayer: !schedule
[9:05:45] StreamElements: What schedule? Shroud is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.
[9:05:49] bnans: @PsyNytes yeah i'll try and make one for mike as well and keep it updated
[9:06:01] chrisso_au: @optionalgames ok, so if I play and older DLC does that mean there's less people on that server?
[9:06:22] PsyNytes: No huge worry there, we're used to the unscheduled. Largely. Appreciate your hard work @bnans shroudCute
[9:06:36] bnans: bnansLove
[9:06:40] dorayakichan: missed
[9:06:46] loyoulo: man the heal
[9:06:48] OptionalGames: @christopha_au It doesn't  work like that.  In WoW when an expansion releases everyone plays in the same server, they just get higher level than you.  In some expansions, the entirety of the lower level world was revamped as well but that's only happened once.  Otherwise, you have your choice of where to level through old content to hit level cap.
[9:06:48] cudrucker: Shroud its been a blast thanks for the mount
