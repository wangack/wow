[1:01:46] NBK_Sethus: dying lol, because people cant be bothered to watch some boring pve esports?
[1:01:48] Sandisy: watching splits is boring, so when they finally get around to pulling mythic you're kinda over it already
[1:02:01] Thoreya: @alucard3zz dying how lol, retained most subs for the pat couple expansions
[1:02:05] Thoreya: past*
[1:02:54] t_train_va: Or do it like 14 where there is no PTR for the raid and they have to learn it blind

[1:12:51] EdWongHau4: @Alepouditsa yea, I feel I have little stuff do to when I'm up to 390 on alt and dont raid/do mythics
[1:13:07] adam6683: Ya too much. I quit pve for now and just doing pvp

[1:14:39] thecynicalshuffler: i think 10.07 letting you upgrade your storm gear to rank 3 is good but i think it should be higher than 392. thats only 10 ilvl higher @Towelliee

[1:16:02] Alepouditsa: @EdWongHau4 my hads hurts the more i have to move around danPanic
[1:16:16] EdWongHau4: @TheGiant99 kinda yes, but its more about sense of progression, and not raw numbers. I still wouldn't raid even if I was 415, but I sometimes do lfg fro mogs, so that would benefit others I guess

[1:25:17] FluffehZ: @Towelliee That new talent tree is just a lot of mats you have to grind, some special low rate drop items
[1:25:51] ikoopa: 415 zug zugger
[1:25:59] acebme: @ikoopa M1 is still mythic, just not a timed key. just saying
[1:26:02] FluffehZ: oh it's gonna be VERY grindy
[1:26:27] EdWongHau4: @Mecabeast I get it, but why at this point, they can't lift them? no lockout while random, and lockout when you target it?
[1:26:29] ikoopa: @acebme I think you should just stick to heroics lol
[1:26:32] saltybcn: I have done d3 seasons since season 12. I can help you if you want. @towelliee
[1:26:49] ikoopa: @acebme If you cant comprehend that lol
[1:26:52] xsp00n: even not knowing what to do you can finish the tree by monday
[1:27:10] Mecabeast: I trolled myself earlier this week with quaking and the giant elementals attack where he puts the area denial down
[1:27:17] ItsXolten: Lot of bots in that game, they do not enforce anything lol
[1:27:44] xsp00n: theres lots of bots in every game, D3 theres no point of bots

[1:27:56] DeSneky: Paragon
[1:28:09] acebme: @ikoopa No. lol  M0 means 0 mythic. The trend is wrong
[1:28:17] xsp00n: they dont paragon farm while they sleep
[1:28:29] xsp00n: theyd literally lose tens of thousands of hours if they got caught
[1:29:03] ItsXolten: @shac20 I'm not saying the top players just people in general
[1:29:17] DeSneky: More paragon is more damage

[5:39:37] EthicalHermit: There used to be an ICD for the pet
[5:39:46] j_hooligan: it gives him a ton of haste i believe
[5:40:08] EthicalHermit: I think you get a buff?
[5:40:20] EthicalHermit: Or he gets a stack per
[5:40:29] LoneRangers: @dimofodi so my pvp gloves are vers mast which I need and when I convert to set piece it's crit haste. Is there no way to keep vers?
