[2:34:36] trentbail23: I cannot believe that bear and brew didnt get anything.
[2:34:36] Vexusprime: yea but all those buffs are single target buffs as well in aoe build
[2:34:37] Thoreya: telling u

[2:36:16] ColdBrewSnob: oof sin fell off
[2:36:17] zwappes: 4% buff on DK isnt even a real 4% buff, its 3.5%~ cuz it doesnt buff melee's, helm enchant or leggo,
[2:36:23] Xastin3: but they have no aoe
[2:36:24] Neotahl: What is your silken lining uptime   normally in a key?

[2:38:20] Xastin3: i mean ret brings about same damage reduction as aug
[2:38:25] Xastin3: right?
[2:38:27] chimeraxst: @dorki minor solution to afflicted and incorp to make it less punished if failed, instead of 100% haste loss, 2-5% haste/dam loss instead just so it slows the key down instead of pretty much killing ur group?

[2:46:53] misran: 4.1 ST 6.6 3T for shadow
[2:46:54] Zircons: the age of shadow returns
[2:46:54] klondike_wow: so we're back to evil church man next week?
[2:47:01] kalsonc: @dorki  are the bdk changes - any good? will it change up the meta?
[2:47:02] dango0n: just started gearing my Shadow priest too lol
[2:47:09] marcofellipe69: that yung cryptics and yipz do be built different
[2:47:13] executioner188: @Fenzlx is 2% to 5% a pretty huge feel or is it like a small change
[2:47:15] manlyhandles: Evil church man NOOOO
[2:47:17] marcofellipe69: galileo I mean yumy tv always growl
[2:47:20] bareuheldig: its not
[2:47:21] ShadowLightVT: @Vexusprime I'm saying in M+ spec.
[2:47:24] kondelol: AINTNOWAY boomkin
[2:47:24] chopsaki: for science.. do two identical runs.. one with aug.. one with shadow
[2:47:26] KaladinHS: its not ret
[2:47:27] Fenzlx: @Fenzlx noticable
[2:47:28] marcofellipe69: he op and consistent
[2:47:29] odvic: question . since rogues use 25 count down to guarantee 4 buff on first pack, could they take it a step further with punching bag? guaranteed 5 buff on first pack is kinda wild
[2:47:30] gankeds: no aug
[2:47:30] mariqlol: ST 4.1% for sp
[2:47:31] Zircons: evil church man Despairge
[2:47:32] ArcaneSyntax: it's actually 3 ret paladins @dorki
[2:47:33] TwicksTV: ~4% st ~7.5% dungeon overall
[2:47:33] KaladinHS: ret doesnt have synergy
[2:47:34] taco2costume: you dont need aug, they are so tanky
[2:47:34] ItsYent: next we get bear druid
[2:47:36] Lonely_TTV: fire mage shadow priest boomkin disc, double pi
[2:47:38] Xastin3: i think its fire mage, boomkin, ret
[2:47:39] Dulwa: where do i find the class tuning?
[2:47:40] Denekyy: Mage havoc speoest godcomp
[2:47:43] logistics1994: no way its ret, meanwhile ret brings more to surv then aug
[2:47:43] dango0n: wtb frost dk rework
[2:47:50] TunzaTanks: fire mage spriest ret meta COPIUM
[2:47:52] manlyhandles: OMEGALUL
[2:47:57] Vexusprime: ret in raid is about to pump
[2:47:59] taanzfour: yiesus is a gamer
[2:48:03] trentbail23: @dango0n Frost DK is the forgotten spec.
[2:48:03] Bazzalock: WARLOCK META
[2:48:12] bareuheldig: ret do be unkillable and have alot of utility
[2:48:20] Xastin3: fire mage boomkin, ret, VDH, Disc
[2:48:20] Vexusprime: on volcoross those changes make them like 2nd best dps only getting beat by sub on pure ST
[2:48:24] Zircons: ret rotation is also completely brainless too
[2:48:31] Denekyy: U take havoc for the brand.
[2:48:33] ArcaneSyntax: Ret in BRH is already a god
[2:48:35] sweetmyassfish: bow down to the pink class idiots ret is meta
[2:48:36] lifeissadx: why are u saying ret meta xd
[2:48:37] nickothemuss12: Ret doesn't need buffs, their damage is good, they need a talent rework so they don't 'HAVE TO' choose between ST or AoE
[2:48:38] sweetmyassfish: like ive been saying
[2:48:38] spooooOooooOOOOoooooOooop: What do you think current MDI key level comps are @dorki
[2:48:43] pinkqy: @Zircons yea, as opposed to like boomkin or something super complex
[2:48:59] Vexusprime: @nickothemuss12 bro they got the biggest rework this expac they're not getting another one anytime soon
[2:49:02] idk_zombie: ret is how much of a % increase, and is that overall,. aoe or st
[2:49:14] odvic: question . since rogues use 25 count down timer to guarantee 4 buff on first pack, could they take it a step further with punching bag? guaranteed 5 buff on first pack is kinda wild(If it works)
[2:49:15] ScapeeJ: When Gromnak keys?
[2:49:19] marcofellipe69: gromnak
[2:49:20] DutchGameLab: he went non verbal xdd
[2:49:22] isntnoble: that dude has a 22 lol
[2:49:24] marcofellipe69: leveling up
[2:49:27] marcofellipe69: yall doubting him to the top
[2:49:31] Ventorpoe: Get Seraphinexd
[2:49:35] Esjames458: hes at the gym
[2:49:39] nickothemuss12: @Vexusprime Not a complete rework just move abilities around in the talent tree so you can mix AoE and ST
[2:49:41] KaladinHS: its going to be vdh, resto druid, sp, fire mage, aug
[2:49:48] TunzaTanks: kriptix
[2:49:49] nickothemuss12: like every other class in the game
[2:49:52] c3rby_: Feralbottom right next to fatgaylover
[2:49:54] OG_Kawngi: Wokege shadow meta
[2:50:04] kalsonc: @dorki  are the bdk changes - any good? will it change up the meta?
[2:50:05] Aandromega: How much avoidance do you have?
[2:50:07] Ventorpoe: you definitely replace the boomkin :)
[2:50:10] Ventorpoe: get em out
[2:50:10] Xastin3: i think boomkin still going to be better then spriest
[2:50:11] clushiee: @kalsonc lol
[2:50:12] Cowboy_Joe: SP MAGE ROGUE
[2:50:17] Shalodar: Imagine not putting in the giga ret... LUL
[2:50:19] boxytt: prolly replace the aug unless you need it to survive
[2:50:19] marcofellipe69: GoatEmotey GoatEmotey GoatEmotey
[2:50:20] minglium: man, where is the bear buffs?
[2:50:21] ShazChamp: @kalsonc lol
[2:50:25] ScapeeJ: Meta comp includes Gromnak
[2:50:29] Vexusprime: @nickothemuss12 they should've done that in the first place but we won't get ret changes until like next expac at the soonest
[2:50:31] Celestial990: LMAO bdk
[2:50:37] taco2costume: boomkins spend 50% of the key in bear form
[2:50:38] pinkqy: bdk is maintenance buff simulator, it fucking blows to play
[2:50:38] TunzaTanks: garbanzo beans are based
[2:50:50] Bazzalock: WARLOCK metaaaa
[2:50:52] omgmrpupu: i want op bdk in M+
[2:50:54] omgmrpupu: hope one day
[2:50:55] clushiee: @dorki does s2 bear even come close to current vdh realistically
[2:51:03] c3rby_: Make it do no single target dmg in raid so they have to make a choice, and give it giga aoe?
[2:51:03] marvinsbestfriend: @Bazzalock no prior dam no meta gg
[2:51:05] nickothemuss12: @Vexusprime Yeah I hear you, it is a bit shit for rets but like you said it won't happen
[2:51:08] executioner188: why cant they just make raid its own thing, didnt they do that with some other class where its strong in keys but raid its nerfed
[2:51:10] Marpell: member when dorki made us believe that bdk is insane?
[2:51:11] fletch1ee: why is it so good in raid then compared to M+???
[2:51:15] trentbail23: @clushiee absolutely not. no where close to the utility .
[2:51:17] cryptic_zz: @Bazzalock HUH
[2:51:19] executioner188: like everything compared to pvp
[2:51:21] Zircons: @fletch1ee literally just doesn't die
[2:51:25] Marpell: like the highest damage tank KekW
[2:51:28] Thoreya: dratty already made a video about the tuning LUL LUL
[2:51:32] omgmrpupu: yeah back in shadowland
[2:51:44] BigBusiness: brewmaster also really good for raid
[2:51:49] JayPain: finaly feral druid buffs <3
[2:51:49] Leknok: any ret enjoyers in the chat?
[2:51:56] superonionn00: which tier piece do u not use as boomy
[2:51:57] Mehdehh: @clushiee It was better in everything except CCs imo
[2:51:58] Linith_Heart: DK needs target scaling DR
[2:52:00] fletch1ee: ah i see, so as long as they dont get oneshot they always cann heal?
[2:52:00] Jacksprat47: dks are the best tank when you take less than your max health in damage every gcd
[2:52:03] fletch1ee: AH i see
[2:52:10] Marpell: no brew tuning at all, can we get a silence keg, pls?
[2:52:13] Alassianss: i never inv bdk in bolstering weeks :D
[2:52:16] TunzaTanks: @Bazzalock you heard em, ympzz time
[2:52:16] Alassianss: they always get clapped
[2:52:17] Meowsan: Hi dorki you think UH for mdi is the play? O/
[2:52:21] nickothemuss12: @Leknok will never enjoy the class until they mix AoE and ST talents together instead of picking one
[2:52:24] menzlo: They should get m+ aura
[2:52:35] TwiqsWoW: predictable raid damage is so easy for them to prepare for
[2:52:35] draconisraccoonis: @Marpell no looks like were all stuck in VDH prison
[2:52:41] dango0n: you get the leggo yet?
[2:52:43] heloraeon: so what does brewmaster need to be if not meta more acceptable in m+?
[2:52:44] manlyhandles: just need the leggo DESPAIR
[2:52:47] Robbanraptor: m+ talents when?
[2:52:52] Leknok: @nickothemuss12 but now we'll do on par dmg with other on ST and out dmg everyone in aoe :)
[2:53:21] danaxvx: monk at bottom of list dorkiLook
[2:53:22] Xastin3: i love brew but vdh and prot have too many stops
[2:53:24] Slapsstick: silence keg would help a ton, grouping is the hardest part of brew for me
[2:53:30] Marpell: brew does the highest damage, not the best utility
[2:53:31] Slapsstick: grouping casters anyway
[2:53:32] chimeraxst: still would love to see #'s on the game on whats replayed more in a season  M+ or raiding
[2:53:35] atuss: are they buffing warriors and hunters?
[2:53:35] Blackiichan_: give cr to brew
[2:53:37] asd123qwerty1: whats that name of the monk in your /keys LOL
[2:53:38] draconisraccoonis: if thats all it takes then i guess were only playing VDH since no other class is as useful as VDH then is what youre saying
[2:53:38] nickothemuss12: @Leknok Still feels horrible to pick between AoE and ST instead of having it mixed
[2:53:38] lifeissadx: what brew need? a rework prob alongside with ww
[2:53:39] draconisraccoonis: cool
[2:53:50] Marpell: give us a silence keg, or 2 charges of RoP
[2:53:50] Raerdk: 2 charges of leg sweep - fixed
[2:54:10] trentbail23: i would love either a faster CD on incap roar or a second charge for bear.
[2:54:12] loppy_07: @dorki is there any weird interaction with silence sigil on 2nd boss of EB i feel like it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt interrupt
[2:54:14] draconisraccoonis: cool 2 of 6 tanks
[2:54:16] draconisraccoonis: awesome
[2:54:26] Neotahl: How about a choice node for ring of peace, ring of silence
[2:54:26] palalords: i feel that the bigest issue with tank tuning in mm + is that we need to much cc / kick  they should just nerf the need for cc in mm+ to balence tank
[2:54:27] Vardred32: wait isnt the spriest buff insane?
[2:54:32] Vexusprime: @draconisraccoonis gonna be 3 next season with bear
[2:54:36] manlyhandles: warrior tank Despairge
[2:54:37] KaladinHS: prot pally is good this week cause of afflicted and tyrannical or in dungeons that need poison dispel but not good outside of that
[2:54:37] Alassianss: vdh is just too goddamn broken
[2:54:38] rockosmodernwaifu: hi dorki dorkiEZ
[2:54:39] abos3dq8ty: !ADDONS
[2:54:39] Nightbot: WeakAuras, Details!, ElvUI, Plater, Big Debuffs, OmniCD. Party frames are WoW default. !ui for links to my UI
[2:54:44] menzlo: I feel like passenger princess when I play with prot pala
[2:54:48] Fathomz: You think Brew is to button bloated atm?
[2:54:52] draconisraccoonis: @Vexusprime it wont be until they revert the blood frenzy nerf
[2:54:59] natiiveee: VDH + RESTO DRUID + FMAGE  SP+  RET (FK AUG) GG META COMP
[2:55:06] Mehdehh: @Marpell That is NOT true brew is one of the lowest damage tanks in raid and easily behind DH in m+
[2:55:13] draconisraccoonis: i dont understand why people want blizz to add more specs and classes they cant even balance the ones they have
[2:55:27] lifeissadx: @natiiveee xddddd why every1 thinks sp and ret gonna be meta xd
[2:55:28] Xhelan: @draconisraccoonis 100% just because it's exciting
[2:55:30] baris181078: nativeee u are right
[2:55:30] PrtxyzPac: talent build you running this week?
[2:55:31] Vexusprime: @draconisraccoonis thats how i feel about people saying to add more support specs lmfao
[2:55:35] executioner188: MORE CONTEEEEEENT
[2:55:36] kittkattklunk: subscribed for pro tips like that
[2:55:38] c3rby_: WHY DOES TWITCH THINK I KNOW SPANISH
[2:55:39] fat_european0: @draconisraccoonis Becuase most players don't care about the game being super balanced and just want to have fun with new classes
[2:55:40] bl4ckbones: my survival got buffed by 4% yet still no utility added
[2:55:47] corient7: @dorki  why am I hard stuck at 25s
[2:55:49] Alassianss: for fun DansGame ?
[2:55:51] horizondelta: feral still being like bottom 3 melee dps after buffs is so sad
[2:55:51] Vexusprime: people saying that we need more support specs when blizz can't even balance 1 lmao
[2:55:54] AddyRPG: SMOrc
[2:55:55] cocopowdong: D:
[2:55:59] DanKnee16: Should I just give up and roll a mage? The main character
[2:56:04] ixieus: SMOrc me zugzug hit with hammer
[2:56:05] Razzeu: Arrive fun in wow?
[2:56:12] Drakoclaw111: mmos aren’t meant to be balanced
[2:56:18] Xastin3: alot classes have fundamental problems... tuning doesnt matter if its close cause utlity isnt close.
[2:56:22] fat_european0: @dorki The game isn't even unbalanced for the average player. You can play any spec and clear 99% of content
[2:56:26] juno_sha: DELETE ELE SHAMAN RAGEY
[2:56:35] guynormally: I predict a new Artificer class in the dwarf expansion and it'll support like aug
[2:56:40] TunzaTanks: make ele a support spec RAGEY
[2:56:42] dango0n: we need a blood manipulator spec like Choso from JJK
[2:56:42] Bazzalock: reckon more buffs are inc?
[2:56:46] Alassianss: vdh need nerf
[2:56:53] trentbail23: they balance classes mid patch with % buffs. it wont fix the issue if the class is still flawed fundementally
[2:56:55] Slapsstick: I wish people would just game, stuff isnt hard enough to need a meta comp until you get to high 20's
[2:57:01] menzlo: No
[2:57:06] KaladinHS: mage needs to be nerfed
[2:57:10] KaladinHS: they are too useful
[2:57:12] fat_european0: mage needs buffs
[2:57:13] Ventorpoe: i want some dungeon tuning
[2:57:16] menzlo: The tuning cadence has been super slow
[2:57:17] Ventorpoe: thats whati want
[2:57:17] baris181078: mages got mega nerf
[2:57:17] st0rmblessed__: @dorki why do u think class tuning did they announce anything?
[2:57:25] baris181078: they dont need any nerf
[2:57:29] PepikStep: wish they did a little buff work on Gaurdian
[2:57:35] poroyou: infinitely scaling dmg feels bad
[2:57:35] blackhawk37739: what do you think will be in the next dungeon pool
[2:57:37] Neotahl: Top 3 dungeon nerfs you want?
[2:57:38] dango0n: I want to see more hero spec talents
[2:57:39] Razzeu: Prayge holy, same
[2:57:40] mariqlol: YEP
[2:57:40] Mehdehh: Sad they didn't buff at least brew ST damage, the effort is so not worth in raids
[2:57:43] menzlo: Nerf throne first boss plz
[2:57:43] juno_sha: DELETE THIS WEEK
[2:57:45] Vardred32: me :)
[2:57:46] kondelol: bolstering DESPAIR
[2:57:46] poroyou: then on death dmg on top of dmg
[2:57:47] TunzaTanks: they need to buff all dungeons to be as hard as rise honestly
[2:57:48] jbenson444: I would love to tank keys this week, but fuck these affixes
[2:57:48] Vexusprime: they never should've added in afflicted/incorp imo
[2:57:49] Kazoooie: hard agree
[2:57:51] quicksscope8: gearing alts this week
[2:57:53] Ventorpoe: I love being a burden on my group because i cant dispel
[2:57:54] Thasin22: The class tuning always seems to be meaningless.
[2:57:55] TunzaTanks: ChattingFast
[2:57:57] guynormally: it's an alt gearing week YEP
[2:57:59] Alassianss: afflicted + tyra so much happening
[2:58:03] Darklott: its actually insane that they havent touched everbloom since the last bolstering
[2:58:06] chronicgrief: remember permanent bolstering though
[2:58:09] marcofellipe69: same miserable Plotge
[2:58:14] marcofellipe69: stay*
[2:58:16] lifeissadx: its ok, its league of legends week
[2:58:17] c3rby_: When they split bolstering from damage to health they shoulda just kept the health instead
[2:58:18] trentbail23: theres no reason to have a boss fight over 5 minutes.
[2:58:23] Kazoooie: how the flowers still trigger affixes is beyond me. crazy
[2:58:24] menzlo: Use bandage on them
[2:58:27] Jacksprat47: bolstering should only last like 5 seconds
[2:58:31] AutomaticJak: 526 raiders from AutomaticJak have joined! 
[2:58:34] marcofellipe69: WoW players are hate watchers by nature
[2:58:35] AutomaticJak: yo
[2:58:42] marcofellipe69: they hate the broken spec, I'm sorry guys
[2:58:43] kondelol: yo
[2:58:44] marcofellipe69: we love u all
[2:58:45] count_chocula4: Would you prefer for affix would be an extra spell or ability for the bosses or mobs
[2:58:45] menzlo: Ayo jak
[2:58:46] TunzaTanks: jak Heart
[2:58:47] sweetmyassfish: ret will 100% be meta
[2:58:49] sweetmyassfish: stop coping
[2:58:50] guynormally: yo jak
[2:58:54] dingoose88: Still a lot of shite specs out there..
[2:58:58] Fatroids: @AutomaticJak how did the sale go?
[2:59:05] greenpy: yo
[2:59:06] AutomaticJak: Big time dam
[2:59:07] KaladinHS: It will be viable
[2:59:09] masenka_: for such a complex game wow is fairly well balanced
[2:59:09] Jacksprat47: @dorkixyumyyaoifanfic lmao
[2:59:12] Alassianss: @dorki is there blue post with changes coming ?
[2:59:13] menzlo: Jak is hpriest bak
[2:59:14] Sarcastard: Y'all doing 30+s will have to to carry runs to 20s for us plebs....
[2:59:19] c3rby_: isnt the whole reason disc is linked is to stop the one shots
[2:59:21] AutomaticJak: Still kinda sucks for spread/burst healing
[2:59:23] trentbail23: @Alassianss wowhead
[2:59:27] Nu_mik: ret cant do st while aoe specd or vice versa so it will never be meta
[2:59:46] TunzaTanks: bouncing heals Sadge
[2:59:51] juno_sha: Nerf holy back!
[2:59:54] AutomaticJak: Yep or you have to heal one or two people at a time, so everbloom mage boss is sketch
[2:59:54] Linith_Heart: @dorki you think you ever going to do a guide on defensives or trash mobs?
[3:00:06] Troniin: watch the Dr. Atnos video
[3:00:09] AutomaticJak: Yea not so much, baby shields
[3:00:14] count_chocula4: 1 person...
[3:00:20] Vexusprime: they should just removed negative affixes and put in positive affixes that rotate weekly, make the main difficulty in the dungeon scaling not dealing with bolstering or afflicted
[3:00:30] Cammoree: yess
[3:00:31] Troniin: yeah
[3:00:35] Xhelan: @Vexusprime all the enemies hug you :)
[3:00:37] jenkinsdonuttv: Hey Dorki! How do you like the boomkin buffs? Kappa
[3:00:52] count_chocula4: What if theres an affix that would make the dungeon aggro radius increase the longer you're in
[3:00:53] guynormally: reaction time veryCat
[3:00:55] Vexusprime: @Xhelan eventually all enemies one shot you case its an infinitely scaling game mode lol
[3:00:55] friendshrimp: how big is the BDK buff
[3:00:56] KaladinHS: dratnos hasnt even pushed keys
[3:00:57] kondelol: DRATTY
[3:00:58] AutomaticJak: He wasnt first tho PopCorn
[3:00:59] manlyhandles: DRATTY
[3:01:07] Kazoooie: guy is fast
[3:01:09] dango0n: dratnos is fast as fk boi
[3:01:11] TunzaTanks: DRATTY
[3:01:14] juno_sha: DRATTY
[3:01:18] juno_sha: show face
[3:01:18] menzlo: How is he so quick with it
[3:01:20] juno_sha: Madge
[3:01:27] isntnoble: he just reads the post wdym
[3:01:29] shale93: revert all bolstering changes that went through over they years that would be fun KEKW

[3:01:38] TunzaTanks: Gladgi
[3:01:39] natiiveee: @AutomaticJak bro but ript dici ? shadow on comp so resto druid take that spot
[3:01:44] Oracle_WoW: thank god for youtubers reading wowhead. not sure how i'd process the info otherwise
[3:01:50] jenkinsdonuttv: It's like a 2% dmg reduction at best I think xdd
[3:01:56] menzlo: Reading hard
[3:01:59] Galarian_Hp: 80% means basically like start of BfA before it got nerfed xD
[3:02:03] gayge_clap: frost dk buffs Gladgi

[6:19:06] Drows95: HOLY
[6:19:11] Nekleb: is ret gonna be one of the best specs with the new buffs?
[6:19:17] syrupmunster: Yeah but if he's only healing her directly atonement isn't doing anything
[6:19:20] Aggroboy: no buffs for Brew, im in shambles
[6:19:48] otigrudo: @aggroboy alcooholicge
[6:19:49] nezo_pont: Brew still not reworked ICANT
[6:19:54] syrupmunster: @discomancer1 it can but if all players are near I think it prioritizes players
[6:20:04] Revulsionn: what’s the sale cuts
[6:20:07] syrupmunster: But you could target her with it
[6:20:44] Aggroboy: id take a small aura buff for brew, feels so squishy

[6:23:18] Chewbaccaw: slow and steady wins the race
[6:23:23] pinkqy: @nezo_pont hopefully never

[6:27:39] NPCChris: Chat, learning to tank. What is the easiest tank worth learning?
[6:28:01] sorenkje: vdh

[6:28:05] otigrudo: Feel the power of clean water
[6:28:25] juno_sha: flaps
[6:28:29] ace50: w/e ur brain can learn
[6:28:47] gigawatersoaker7777: @npcchris dh by merit of it being broken, druid by merit of being intuitive
[6:28:54] GodsFaithInHumanity2: @NPCChris easiest? bear. worth learning? paladin (its always good)

[6:36:42] Cruzerthebruzer: chocolate icecream is so bad
[6:36:43] Cruzerthebruzer: it's unreal
[6:36:54] TBouse: insane bear

[6:37:38] anaya909: the real strat is to skip the extras and spread that out into like 8 burgers
[6:37:56] wonkus1: why isnt dorki on mute

[6:40:08] Lowpaxd: @theredbellpepper 0% chance
[6:40:10] nezo_pont: This sound addon is so creepy
[6:40:14] bigchurchman: "hey guys its blizz here, we're gonna fuck up the meta then nerf/revert in a week. k bye"
[6:40:15] zachl_: @theredbellpepper if they didnt this season- they wont do next season
[6:40:19] Lowpaxd: its just a buffer for next expansion
[6:40:19] zachl_: literal 0% chance
[6:40:24] Celestial990: nah no way, s4 is minimum effort just give us some different dungeons to keep us busy for few months
[6:40:36] EmmaZen: ^^
[6:40:42] theredbellpepper: I guess their class devs are probably working on hero talents or something anyway
[6:40:48] KFCswag: @theredbellpepper dunno, at that point in time, why not pretend it's a feature of the next xpack and delay it a bit
[6:40:58] dalgress: what are the WAs to the left showing the stops and interrupts?
[6:41:03] zachl_: @EmmaZen lebron here to slam another dunk?

[6:41:40] smuggamer1337: i hate wow Sadge
[6:41:41] anaya909: s4 add optional affixes to raid.  killing bosses with affixes drops gear with beneficial versions of those affixes
[6:41:42] juno_sha: This season and next season suck
[6:41:53] HarveyPls: @juno_sha they are forcing you to play wow at gunpoint PoroSad
[6:41:53] zachl_: wottt
[6:41:56] anaya909: like killing a mob drops sanguine that heals party and dmg's mobs
[6:41:58] zachl_: i think this season is kinda fun
[6:42:01] juno_sha: Cryge
[6:42:02] Celestial990: if it is all DF dungeons, playing some of s1 dungeons as a vdh will be pretty fun
[6:42:07] zachl_: chat 1 if u like this season 2 if u do not like this season
[6:42:10] zachl_: 1 or 2
[6:42:13] FloatNg: 1

[6:42:19] anaya909: 2, worst season ever
[6:42:20] nezo_pont: 2
[6:42:21] juno_sha: 2
[6:42:34] KFCswag: 1
[6:42:43] HarveyPls: i dont dislike it but its kinda mid
[6:42:44] theredbellpepper: the only thing good about it is that it's easy to push higher than usual and timers are forgiving. I hate the actual dungeons
[6:42:51] ppdxd: its 100 times better than last season, but season 1 was goated
[6:42:52] Celestial990: HUH if you're saying 2 then do you think seasons 1 and/or 2 were better? cuz there aint no way
[6:43:02] anaya909: i loved s2
[6:43:04] Celestial990: s1 was fuckin ruined by thundering man
[6:43:04] theredbellpepper: I liked both seasons 1 and 2 more than this
[6:43:09] smuggamer1337: season 2 was garbage
[6:43:14] Celestial990: and doing the sbg/cos key reroll roulette was so bad
[6:43:18] sorenkje: remove thundering and s1 becomes so good
[6:43:21] dalgress: what are the WAs to the left showing the stops and interrupts?
[6:43:22] nezo_pont: I feel like there are only 2 dungeons I greatly enjoy to play, others are either mid, or annoying
[6:43:30] zachl_: i genuinely enjoy this season
[6:43:38] zachl_: it hurts to see my brethren press 2
[6:43:40] Celestial990: kumvoke BASED
[6:44:04] otigrudo: @dalgress omnicd addon, not wa
[6:44:20] dalgress: cheers man
[6:44:23] Possitiviti: class tuning?
[6:44:28] theredbellpepper: I feel like the worst dungeons in both S1 and S2 were the non-DF ones. IF S4 has all the DF dungeons, it's gonna be lit
[6:44:56] juno_sha: The only good thing about this season for me is that i've gotten 50 mounts
[6:44:56] nezo_pont: S3 DF dungeons are so annoying to play
[6:44:59] Celestial990: not wrong, but some of the DF dungeons were close to worst or bad so that doesnt help
[6:45:00] juno_sha: 2 today
[6:45:00] anaya909: idk i had a great time in vortex pinnacle.  and neltharion's lair is actually why i resubbed s2
[6:45:16] zachl_: HUH\
[6:45:18] zachl_: ??
[6:45:19] Celestial990: whats the mount count in total?
[6:45:29] juno_sha: 365
[6:45:29] rubbadubdubby: yeah cuz ruby pools was top tier un huh
[6:45:31] zachl_: vortex and neltharions lair were wat brought u back ????
[6:45:33] Cruzerthebruzer: @anaya909 aight square up
[6:45:44] rubbadubdubby: vortex was a good dungeon
[6:45:49] Cruzerthebruzer: those two dungeons gotta be top 5 of the worst dungeons I've ever done
[6:45:50] zachl_: ????????????????????????????????
[6:45:51] sorenkje: MODS
[6:45:52] Celestial990: rookie numbers but keep it going, you probably started recently
[6:45:54] rubbadubdubby: nelths lair no ty
[6:45:58] zachl_: vortex is probably the worst dungeon to existence
[6:45:59] HarveyPls: i miss halls of valor t b h
[6:45:59] anaya909: lol yup i loved neltharion's lair in legion.  and always said if they brought it back, i'd go ham
[6:46:09] HarveyPls: seeing ppl get completely gapped by hyrja was my favourite
[6:46:16] zachl_: @HarveyPls gaped*
[6:46:19] ExtremeChad: hello moonkin enjoyers
[6:46:30] ppdxd: i miss algethar and azure vault
[6:46:33] theredbellpepper: Hyrja completed dependent on tank pulling off inversion
[6:46:47] nezo_pont: I think Neltharion was okay, but whoever agreed on the VP design should not design anything again
[6:46:50] anaya909: every pull in VP > having camera up my rear hole for 98% of waycrest manor
[6:46:51] rubbadubdubby: i mean i'm not saying vortex is top, was mid
[6:46:57] rubbadubdubby: but some of these DF dungeons aint it
[6:47:02] theredbellpepper: yes, VP is middle of F tier
[6:47:08] Cruzerthebruzer: hoi is the only bad DF dungeon
[6:47:09] zachl_: df also had bangers tho
[6:47:15] zachl_: cant be so quick to call df dungeons bad
[6:47:16] Shimorta: i hope they do th best dungeons of the xpac in this season. algethar, FH, UR, brackenhide, HOV type beat
[6:47:16] zachl_: nokhud
[6:47:17] zachl_: azure
[6:47:19] zachl_: uh
[6:47:20] zachl_: bracken
[6:47:21] Cruzerthebruzer: aa
[6:47:22] Celestial990: @theredbellpepper you definitely didnt need to do that unless u were trying to do a really high key level
[6:47:22] zachl_: S tier dungeons
[6:47:23] HarveyPls: vaults is a good one
[6:47:23] zachl_: ya
[6:47:24] zachl_: AA
[6:47:28] zachl_: df has bangers
[6:47:32] rubbadubdubby: yeah DF has some good ones
[6:47:37] juno_sha: nokhud sucks butt
[6:47:39] FloatNg: AA is so goated
[6:47:40] zachl_: ?
[6:47:44] anaya909: brackenhide was cool
[6:47:47] juno_sha: dumb dungeon
[6:47:48] Celestial990: RLP with vdh to control casters would be sick
[6:47:50] Scoops__: i think bracken is the only one ill look back on favorably
[6:47:51] HarveyPls: thinking about my dps meters in AA is goated idk about the actual key
[6:47:57] Cruzerthebruzer: rlp is sick i know a lot of people hate it though
[6:48:03] rubbadubdubby: Rise is a big L tho
[6:48:03] Cruzerthebruzer: the bosses are fun
[6:48:07] Scoops__: they're good not great.
[6:48:07] anaya909: rlp is a fun healer dungeon for sure
[6:48:11] zachl_: @Cruzerthebruzer everyone will always hate a healer dungeon
[6:48:13] Celestial990: rlp was high octane action all the time it was good just unfair with some affixes
[6:48:14] nezo_pont: Dawn of infinite is bad too imo, they are both so annoying to play because of lack of visual clarity imo
[6:48:16] zachl_: healing now vs s1 tho
[6:48:17] Cruzerthebruzer: ya that's just what it is
[6:48:19] zachl_: rlp would be a joke
[6:48:35] theredbellpepper: I hope DOTI doesn't make it to S4. Definitely not liking it
[6:48:42] Nickystr1x: if a healer likes it you know its beans
[6:48:49] Cruzerthebruzer: It's almost for sure all 10 DF dungfeons i think
[6:48:50] rubbadubdubby: @nezo_pont no joke, i think retail would be almost 10/10 if they cleaned up some of the visual issues in raids/dungeons
[6:48:53] zachl_: @theredbellpepper it will be all 10 most certainly
[6:49:00] EmmaZen: i actually like rise
[6:49:08] zachl_: theyre bringing the 3 raids= and the 10 dungeons that come with it
[6:49:11] zachl_: @EmmaZen bye.
[6:49:21] juno_sha: All mega dungeons suck
[6:49:23] theredbellpepper: @EmmaZen forbidden take
[6:49:29] Cruzerthebruzer: anyone else hate emma
[6:49:33] anaya909: mechanically the dungeons are fine.  the camera issues just give me chest pains
[6:49:35] EmmaZen: wtf lol
[6:49:35] Scoops__: hot take lmao
[6:49:39] juno_sha: Emma Madge

[7:17:12] Y4ENG: demon hunter is nice bc the floor is so low rn but the ceiling is so high for skill

[7:18:46] Chewbaccaw: guys thoughts on odyn as a lore character who is an asshole?
[7:18:48] hdott52: dicki sucky
[7:18:48] Sppartan1: Death strike is too easy.

[7:19:40] theredbellpepper: you forgot the furry warrior
[7:19:48] Farva_Shenanigans: idk about blood dk being the easiest tank. definitely most self reliant in lower content though
[7:20:05] dunt___: xdd
[7:20:12] Bwelder87: whats more annoying in this game than dot specs?

[7:23:16] FloatNg: wat
[7:23:35] Wildfire_Gaming: o7
[7:23:46] Farva_Shenanigans: the best is affliction lock and destro. they gave you a way to aoe dot but the cooldown is longer than the dots last. brilliant
[7:24:17] anaya909: who remembers enemy grid in mop Kreygasm
[7:24:50] anaya909: was like raid frames for dps.  you just mouseover and dot everything

[7:26:54] julian_fmv: but worse like harder? or worse like boring

[8:10:20] m_dep: you should have a % chance to proc a tertiary when buying from the vendor
[8:10:28] m_dep: and just have to spam the vendor to get the tertiary you want
[8:10:29] joolian: could make the vault thing u take for tokens allow tertiaries but that would prob be too op

[8:16:23] shikatsu_: NOTED
[8:16:28] ExtremeChad: I was feral for a few expansions but switched to boomy when it got impossible to get invited to keys

[8:16:59] manlyhandles: NOTED swap specialization to balance
[8:17:07] Morayeden: Bro, fuck this, I'm joining Zackrawr's pruning crusade
[8:17:07] Hoshma46: Convok
[8:17:08] Cruzerthebruzer: why doesn't the last line say log out and play a spec that's not awful
[8:17:09] zeph_6: NOTED swap to fire mage

[8:17:12] flockheart: HeyGuys just tuned in, can you start from the beginning?

[8:17:15] Theliahh: dreamgrove is insane
[8:17:24] fizzis_: holy shit fk that
[8:17:26] manlyhandles: just go PAYPHONE in boomkin
[8:17:28] notSean1992: this looks easy enough coming from BM Kappa
[8:17:29] BLACKFOOT_TN: This is still less Aids than Arcane mage.
[8:17:35] dknamey: unless youre a turbo furry theres no reason to play this spec
[8:17:36] misterworldhide: so the moral of the story chat is to just play outlaw rogue
[8:17:38] fizzis_: shits worse than arcane
[8:17:38] Urebaldd: This is why I main havoc dh
[8:17:40] Morayeden: All of this to do zero dmg
[8:17:52] ExtremeChad: hey at least you dont have to manage snapshotting anymore
[8:17:55] xrader858: lmaooo

[8:18:40] BlazinHurricane: HUH
[8:18:41] xrader858: doing all this to do mid dam is crazy
[8:18:45] Myloozy: this is worse than enhance wth
[8:18:47] Hoshma46: @BLACKFOOT_TN I'd play fury but I like arms a lot more and also hate the S3 tier set.
[8:18:49] ryanbridges: so tldr i am going to log off of my druid and find another spec.
[8:18:51] misterworldhide: i forgot the original question
[8:18:57] manlyhandles: Bedge
[8:19:01] ExtremeChad: this is still earier than the rotation in previous expansions
[8:19:05] ExtremeChad: easier*
[8:19:05] nerotonkol: no STOP
[8:19:07] flockheart: WHAT it gets better?
[8:19:08] Montiguy: where is the priority to swap to boomkin

[8:19:21] yctnm: wtfwtfwtf
[8:19:22] toastbam: BUT ITS EASY ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT RIGHT?
[8:19:25] ryanbridges: @Goop I asked when to use rip and when to use primal wrath
[8:19:27] SuNBeaT: @goop feral coaching live
[8:19:31] xrader858: lmaooo
[8:19:33] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Hoshma46 Arms has dogshit survival in raid. Fury is tanky AF. I don't love Arms. But I will play if I haft to.
[8:19:41] notSean1992: "just look it up on dreamgrove" fucking naaaah
[8:19:43] ryanbridges: and in asking that question, I know to log off my feral druid.
[8:19:45] Niroggo: xdd
[8:19:46] ace50: uuh too much to digest
[8:19:49] hdott52: the jizz?
[8:19:52] flockheart: OK ty
[8:19:52] ExtremeChad: highest skillcap of any spec, argue me
[8:19:55] Morayeden: COGGY
[8:19:58] ryanbridges: Thank you dorki for looking that up for me.
[8:20:01] mars932: ok now do fury warrior
[8:20:01] xrader858: insane
[8:20:02] joolian: if you meow you do more dps
[8:20:10] nerotonkol: nice an ad after the feral guide
[8:20:14] relimee0: OK thanks i am now the best feral in the world because of your teachings
[8:20:17] ExtremeChad: @mars932 SMOrc
[8:20:37] BLACKFOOT_TN: ZUG ZUG
[8:20:46] BasedRudy: TR is already up for MDI ? need to setup my toons
[8:20:46] weezyjw: wish I got an ad during that fetal guide  that shit gave me coggie O
[8:20:55] weezyjw: feral*

[8:21:08] dknamey: CognitiveOverload
[8:21:11] nerotonkol: triple AD lets gooooooooooo
[8:21:14] joolian: its not that bad you just gotta play it a bit trust
[8:21:18] Nerdhino: crit
[8:21:18] tmevil_: vers
[8:21:24] fizzis_: vers yup
[8:21:26] relimee0: Shruge test it
[8:21:27] Hoshma46: @BLACKFOOT_TN It's raid survivability really not as bad as you think it is, if you had said in M+ I'd be more inclined to agree.
[8:21:31] drewsky96: that's what rough specs say
[8:21:43] ayyylmar: play with some of THIS
[8:21:45] fizzis_: you must be clinically insane to main feral
[8:21:48] Nerdhino: look at what type of gems they are, frost gems proc vers
[8:21:52] popularviber: that's cause no one is good enough to unlock its true potential
[8:21:56] discord_421: @dorki It gives you the lower stat of the Gem
[8:22:00] Milked_Bunny: wow you have both trinks from fyrak
[8:22:02] iPwn20: meteos (League streamer) was topping meters in mythic raid yesterday playing feral
[8:22:07] ExtremeChad: feral has been high skill cap like that for like 10 years
[8:22:12] joolian: ur never not thinking about ur rotation its fun
[8:22:16] toastbam: dorki with moonkin, am i supposed to use bsl? or just tox patch with boots?
[8:22:43] rindioh: What do you think about ret buffs dorki? Class looked pretty fine already no?
[8:22:50] itsdatwoowoo: hey.  how do you know when the battle boss in rise is going to war cry?  we are taking more damage from war cry than the stacks/cleaves.
[8:22:59] fizzis_: if something is that difficult, im of the mindset that it better be doing top dmg to make up for it
[8:23:22] tisiwonz: Unholy gonna be giga in mdi
[8:23:25] tisiwonz: holy
[8:23:29] Hoshma46: arms warrior gonna be meta in M+ next week Kappa
[8:23:35] Theliahh: pumpkin spice latte for m+
[8:23:36] xoliathe: unholy will be big balls after reset
[8:23:46] joolian: when i tried ret i noticed so much more about the raid fights than when i was playing feral xdd
[8:23:54] rindioh: Every class has some skill expression, even simple classes is just a question of optimizing everything possible
[8:23:55] fizzis_: its a 3.5% buff lol it wont be that different
[8:23:57] fizzis_: KEKW
[8:24:08] tisiwonz: u see but unholy was already in mdi
[8:24:13] tisiwonz: now its mega
[8:24:18] imjebb: holy just got here now i gotta check wowhead
[8:24:18] BasedRudy: is that TR ? @dorki
[8:24:32] tmevil_: boomkin is so PAYPHONE
[8:24:41] xoliathe: and keep up dots
[8:24:42] zeph_6: NOTED wrath into starfall
[8:24:44] Nerdhino: the hardest part of boomie is surviving LuL
[8:24:54] dk_koshmar: do u like enhance?
[8:24:59] merones: @Nerdhino yeah lmao
[8:25:18] rindioh: What classes would you say is hard? Dont wanna sound elitist but most classes are not very hard?
[8:25:23] Scoops__: NOTED ah yes
[8:25:31] Nerdhino: but why play boomie when you can play warlock 🤔
[8:25:37] Shimorta: outlaw rogue
[8:25:41] xoliathe: not dying on boomy is challenge impossible to 90% of players
[8:25:43] joolian: dev evoker was nice bc of all the free movement it has
[8:25:53] ScoobieRoo: does it still snapshot?
[8:25:55] tisiwonz: have u played arcane
[8:25:56] Urebaldd: Arcane mage probably, but who even plays  that
[8:26:02] Cruzerthebruzer: no spec is really that hard, it's just encounters on top of the spec
[8:26:03] Cakerinotv: not unholy?
[8:26:03] toastbam: Yeah but pre moving is a part of all casters skill expressoon
[8:26:08] bareuheldig: the easiest
[8:26:10] Juanshotts: !ui
[8:26:10] Nightbot: https://linktr.ee/dorkibear grab my UI here or check discord for info/updates! It consists of plater/details/ElvUI/weakauras. Abilities in the middle are ElvUI action bars. CC/CD/interrupt tracker is OmniCD addon. M+ Timer is WarpDeplete addon.
[8:26:10] reedsworld: arcane is easy
[8:26:10] merones: dorki also, do you use the same gear on boomkin for both raid and mythic? i'm trying to get my gear right lol
[8:26:10] imjebb: i feel like outlaw is harder then feral
[8:26:12] xoliathe: @Urebaldd Kyuji plays
[8:26:12] zeph_6: arcane is easy just punishing
[8:26:19] MacRant: arcane has a hard set rotation. quite easy
[8:26:22] Shimorta: unholy easy as fuck nowadays
[8:26:29] Shimorta: got a bunch of cd's, use em
[8:26:31] xgombie: BM
[8:26:34] Cakerinotv: i guess if u dont fuck up ur opener its pretty free
[8:26:35] discord_421: Depends what you mean by hard. There are complicated specs, like UDK raid. It's super complicated, and unintuitive, but it's very straight forward when you get told how to play it
[8:26:45] reedsworld: do you tihnk its good that specs are becoming easier?
[8:26:46] Cakerinotv: in m+ yeah
[8:26:47] Urebaldd: Havoc is complex xdd
[8:26:48] drewsky96: I agree with havoc, spec has so many interactions now. lots of room for optimization
[8:26:50] Cakerinotv: its easy
[8:26:53] reedsworld: think*
[8:26:57] fizzis_: its not
[8:26:58] Cruzerthebruzer: dont you just press your buttons on cd
[8:27:00] xoliathe: nah unholy is simple
[8:27:01] Morayeden: No, very easy spec
[8:27:05] tisiwonz: i mean i think feral is pretty simple
[8:27:08] Cakerinotv: in raid, its just ur opener
[8:27:08] fizzis_: once u learn what to press in what order, is pretty ez
[8:27:11] Morayeden: Opener is everything about UH in raid
[8:27:17] toastbam: I think bm is the most complicated spec in the game
[8:27:19] Shimorta: opener is 15 buttons scripted in a row, and then you repeat small variations of that every 45 seconds
[8:27:26] dango0n: unholy ez.
[8:27:28] discord_421: Like, no one is ever going to figure out naturally army 2 seconds before pull > Outbreak>FS>DnD>DT+Garg>DC>DC>DC>Apoc>UA, but when you are told it, it's straight forward.
[8:27:31] dango0n: pop cooldown
[8:27:33] dango0n: ez
[8:27:47] Shimorta: nobody is figuring out anything on their own
[8:27:51] Shimorta: nobody is home cooking their own rotation rn
[8:27:54] discord_421: You would be surprised
[8:27:56] FFR_Secut0r: Want to start either feral or havoc, but can't decide
[8:28:03] discord_421: I do a lot of UDK log reviews, and the amount of people
[8:28:06] discord_421: I help that have
[8:28:08] zeph_6: new havoc Gladge
[8:28:10] discord_421: abominaitions for openers
[8:28:19] rindioh: But will argue against myself here a bit, the level of complexity is pretty high when you consider we are playing a videogame @dorki
[8:28:23] Shimorta: thats different levels of the game
[8:28:42] Shimorta: you kinda gotta assume you're talking about people who can lab a 15 button opener for 3 hours and memorize it
[8:28:44] Cakerinotv: if u mess up a gcd ur kinda fucked tho, at least in ur window
[8:28:45] notSean1992: BM without looking it up is easy :P
[8:28:48] Urebaldd: This is what will always put new players off
[8:28:51] dk_koshmar: why is bdk discord so toxic
[8:28:54] Cakerinotv: outside of that it hardly matters
[8:29:03] dk_koshmar: where to go for actual bdk discussion
[8:29:04] discord_421: Sure, but what I said originally, was there's a difference between complicated and hard. I think that UDK is complicated, but ultimately not hard.
[8:29:09] zeph_6: just hit a dummie for 20 minutes
[8:29:12] zeph_6: 4Head
[8:29:19] notSean1992: @dk_koshmar what makes you think its toxic in there?
[8:29:23] nightSkyy: My old ass brain finds outlaw hard on dummies still :(
[8:29:30] WayfarerZwe: i always played havoc and unholy and the difference is just bullshit, dh is so much lit if compared to unholy
[8:29:43] dknamey: this chat is the place for bdk discussions OK
[8:29:45] Morayeden: @dk_koshmar Kyrasis
[8:29:47] zeph_6: havoc difficulty comes from the movement
[8:29:59] mickmckillop: mickmckillop subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Let's go
[8:30:15] Cakerinotv: what is the most complicated spec
[8:30:21] ScapeeJ: @mickmckillop Where?
[8:30:27] barbiegirlxxo: is enh hard
[8:30:33] dango0n: all the rogue specs are hard to me
[8:30:38] Urebaldd: Being a clicker and playing feral
[8:30:42] Scoops__: monkaHmm
[8:30:48] xgombie: enh
[8:30:51] Cakerinotv: I think some specs come more naturally to some people
[8:30:57] Cakerinotv: subjective
[8:30:58] dk_koshmar: enh is easyyyy
[8:31:01] Cakerinotv: to some extent
[8:31:06] Urebaldd: Deff subjective
[8:31:08] fizzis_: enh is pretty ez
[8:31:08] ExtremeChad: dorki plays feral clicking spells from the spellbook
[8:31:14] Shimorta: isn't enh ultra piano mode
[8:31:24] GoodyGodfather: Brew is piano mode
[8:31:25] fizzis_: every 24sec u just do your opener again lol
[8:31:26] Cakerinotv: enh is somewhat complicated unless u play storm
[8:31:28] jessebona: I usually just go with anything attached to monks. It's the only class in the entire game that made me feel like I was going to get an RSI from the button spam.
[8:31:34] Jokonn: its giga lottery machine you just need to be able to react to WA and you're fine
[8:31:37] zeph_6: most complicated spec is the one i'm playing
[8:31:38] Cakerinotv: storm u just hit stormstrike on cd
[8:31:52] Silencbank: do they have the unlimited augment rune you can use to save bagspace on the realm?
[8:31:54] altopstra: enhance xdd press thousand button but same damage as warrior
[8:31:57] christsaves: I haven’t played in a long while. why so much crit on vdh?
[8:32:06] Scoops__: are you gonna bother setting up pally or just full on vdh?
[8:32:11] DuCkiii3: whats the mdi comp you think ??
[8:32:13] HarveyPls: its just not intuitive since 5 buttons light up but its not crazy complex to do decent on
[8:32:16] FleGames: !ui
[8:32:16] Nightbot: https://linktr.ee/dorkibear grab my UI here or check discord for info/updates! It consists of plater/details/ElvUI/weakauras. Abilities in the middle are ElvUI action bars. CC/CD/interrupt tracker is OmniCD addon. M+ Timer is WarpDeplete addon.
[8:32:19] Cakerinotv: @christsaves i think crit gives dodge or parry
[8:32:22] heysarias: feral still dumpster after these buffs?
[8:32:27] Jokonn: @christsaves because vers is pretty dog on tanks usually for defensive value. crit gives giga parry which is way better then vers
[8:32:29] yungbooma: in eb
[8:32:32] Morayeden: No healer HOLY
[8:32:40] dk_koshmar: dorki u gunna make a TikTok?

[8:32:50] Scoops__: pally aug uhdk fmage rogue?
[8:32:59] jessebona: @Silencbank There is. 100000 gold and renown with the dream wardens. If you mean what I think you mean.
[8:33:13] Shimorta: if no healer means aug has to come in, healers must be played
[8:33:15] Shimorta: pls god
[8:33:28] Silencbank: @jessebona sorry, i meant specifically available on the tournament realm, which he just showed
[8:33:37] Cakerinotv: theres also a difference between skill floor and ceiling for classes too
[8:33:54] Juanshotts: I dont see his ability UI in his UI link
[8:34:07] DuCkiii3: which class has the lowest floor then lol
[8:34:12] Cruzerthebruzer: I like how they were like "we dont want your bags full of consumes" then they made 3 different weapon runes that stack to 20
[8:34:18] Shimorta: bm hunter prob
[8:34:25] Morayeden: @DuCkiii3 prob bm hunter?
[8:34:35] keyboard94: is buzzing better than howling rune on VDH ?@dorki
[8:34:38] dk_koshmar: poddyc next topic?
[8:34:41] Nerdhino: @Cruzerthebruzer and last through death and an hour, how is this a problem

[8:35:01] NoStress15: it stacks to 20 is the problem?
[8:35:07] WayfarerZwe: how many crit/haste would be good to have?
[8:35:33] dk_koshmar: I have parasocial relationship with dratnos I need therapy
[8:35:37] Cakerinotv: i feel like mage would have a high ceiling most of those giga mages are just built different
[8:35:39] HarveyPls: @Cakerinotv i think the skill floor is far more relevant in wow because of the lesser mechanical demand
[8:36:04] Therapy2: @dk_koshmar what do u need
[8:36:06] paragon_penguin: what addon is that? thats giving a lot more macro slots
[8:36:25] BasedRudy: How do you have TR access already ? Madge
