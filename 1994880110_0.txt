[0:29:01] jovitacky: I agree that classic players can play retail and vice versa but i do think in terms of the hardest content available, retail is much harder
[0:29:02] brownymaster: do they have percent achievements statistics for retail? just check how many players don't do the uber endgame hardest stuff
[0:29:05] javus0234: rotations are muscle memory anyway, what difference does it make.   Try organising 40 people for a raid, that's difficult KEK
[0:29:10] Durminon: The hardest part of WoW is to find the time to do stuff

[0:32:11] khalicsus: @singsing why you not ask Ouker and other to play WOW HC?

[0:33:51] LemonTrick: roguetrader SoonTM
[0:33:51] wessirius: @singsing  don't you think that current dota is overloaded wiith mechanics (especially in recent years) for a new players and it kinda hurts the game, as player base stagnates
[0:33:54] Trajan_Hunter: min max is only good for competition. The only time that makes sense in PvE is when you try to beat other people's previous bests and whatnot.
[0:33:54] iplaythings: dont you have to gear to get into raid tho ? monkaHmm
[0:33:58] RaxtonTV: more rage Pog

[0:35:07] RaxtonTV: I think you have to kind of think of it from a different direction, the max in the "minmax" of classic wow is SO easy to achieve that people obsess over it, even though its not needed at all
[0:35:08] Trajan_Hunter: I love PoE. Too bad that it is waaaay too big brain for me.
[0:35:10] lkalburatl: guys do i need to buy POE expansion to properly play it?

[0:36:40] seewhybee: 99% of wow players dont even do any mythic raids
[0:36:45] RaxtonTV: @singsing I think you have to kind of think of it from a different direction, the max in the "minmax" of classic wow is SO easy to achieve that people obsess over it, even though its not needed at all
[0:36:45] heyitsMart: singCD Clap
[0:36:47] Darth_Pantsu: ayyy rucky day FeelsOkayMan

[0:36:57] sea_fishu: 1 game enjoyer KEK
[0:36:58] pulupukuo: tie23 xdd
[0:37:00] javus0234: The reason why all these discussions even start are because wow players are several years of lifetime in, and if their game isn't the best they admit they wasted their life for a bad game, so they have to prove to everyone that wow is the GOAT
[0:37:04] Gunznrocketz: singCD Clap

[0:38:57] sicparvismagna06: yeah i learn poe from looking at others build

[0:39:56] brat0ri: are you on living flame? @singsing
[0:39:56] BotanicLight: !addon
[0:39:59] Zululli: then again Ben_ is a former world first raider for Liquid and currently the best or second best poe player in some way, so the skillsets do match to some extent. I'd argue in world first environment wow is the more challenging game but that doesn't mean PoE with racing constraints is super easy either
[0:40:08] Gunznrocketz: !onlyfangs BotanicLight

[0:40:39] aridty: thats the main problem with retail for me
[0:40:40] Zululli: @ApahtyT Yea. I'd maybe consider tie23 for the discussion
[0:40:41] ogoutershell: I think battlegrounds are a good reason to have similar timing in power spikes.
[0:40:44] agaulia: same dick length too?
[0:40:44] Gunznrocketz: @Gunznrocketz np okey there's also !elvui for sing's elvui layout

[0:41:19] Skwishi: Gunznrocketz has rolled a 10
[0:41:20] Nightbot: Banned users will not be able to view stream anymore. Which means backseating = ban = no sing. Don't backseat
[0:41:21] Saffie: I think in this day and age of checking builds online and copying the games need to be far more complicated to have variety in builds where its not clear which build is the best. There needs to be space for discovering cool things like before but its much harder to do now since everything is 'solved'
[0:41:25] humble18: i wanna jump into POE, should i just play the game build whatever i want and the game still 'fun' to play, i mean like no unkillable hardboss because my build is not 'proper'?
[0:41:29] The_Shining_One: yeah, fuck balance whiners, it make the game bland and sterile
[0:41:41] kapputs: @humble18 it is
[0:41:49] 光復香港_時代革命: ELPP
[0:41:56] Yuuuuuuuuuuu: @humble18 do whatever you want

[0:42:03] khalicsus: The only thing why its less interesting to Sing playing HC. because he s smart and oversafe as we all know if the punishmentt of dead is high
[0:42:12] Trajan_Hunter: I guess it depends on what crowd you want to appeal to. If you appeal to the uber end game crowd or the overall experience crowd. It likely goes to whatever spreads the most fun, therefore earns the most money for the company. Sounds fair to me.

[0:42:42] thefakeh: @humble18 you could do it that way, but it probs depends on your experience in similar games. very easy to make a dogshit build thats fucking awful in the campaign
[0:42:53] sicparvismagna06: @humble18 i mean, im a new poe player too, you 100% can play the game without guide, but looking a build for reference is more nice in my experiences, but its not really fun if you just copy paste the build
[0:43:19] N4ExD: U can't carry anymore KEK
[0:43:22] Trajan_Hunter: I don't tune in too much. Have you died in Hardcore WoW at all?

[0:43:47] brownymaster: actually what happened to d4 OMEGALOOOOL
[0:43:51] DrunkLoliOgre: I guess I should try poe again as a ranged then. I played melee and found the game boring.
[0:44:01] thefakeh: honestly its probably just worth playing along with one of ziz's guides your first time, and then you can try your own the second time
[0:44:07] sicparvismagna06: just stack res

[8:12:48] farnsi: Reticent_88 it was a pretty jank mmo, basically some type of boss can switch aggro. He also had a crit aura KEK it was the worst type of boss+buff possible

[8:13:56] ButtobiBoop: I missed the first 8h of today, did he tank WC?
[8:14:04] farnsi: Reticent_88 Afterward they added a XP pool. So when you died you lost XP and it iwent into a pool you slowly gained back. it was better imo
[8:14:08] heyitsMart: @heyitsMart just have a better spawn next life 4Head
[8:14:19] AnotherZombie: just 4Heed
