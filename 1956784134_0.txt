[2:14:20] patz94: What gamer rating did amphy give to himself?
[2:14:25] tsuin__: Each point of +Defense skill adds 0.04% to the player's chance to be Missed, to Dodge, and to Parry, before diminishing returns are taken into account, and adds 0.04% to the player's chance to Block with no diminishing returns. This means +25 Defense will grant you an extra 1% Miss, Parry, Dodge, and Block. The formula is constant across all classes.
[2:14:27] 0VAK0: It’s not a bad stat, but you don’t go for it specifically. Defense prevents crushing blows, the main weakness for bear druids so in that regard it’s not bad. It just offers such a small percentage and other stats like shield block that do nothing for bears. It will get defensive by default with your Bis ring from MC and warden staff in particular.

[2:15:12] duinrahadgam: I thinkbear tanking is raw HP
[2:15:13] FinnMike: "Defense. Each point of Defense gives you an additional 0.04% chance to be missed, not to be crit, and to be dodged. This is a rare stat, not found on many pieces of gear that Feral Druids have access to. Getting crit can easily kill you if you are not careful, making this an important stat to pick up where you can." Icey veins
