[0:13:51] Texasmilty: I think they are decent but definitely could look better
[0:14:21] dwolters_the_zombieman: I had a really good dream about playing the new expansion first time I had a dream about a video game since before the original RE and the first MK game came out and people didn't believe me about them until they came out. It's weird that in this dream though it was an actual game play of the game and not a clip of the videos we gotten

[0:29:31] Moobot: @aumixp it usually takes ~45 mins after going live to start. its been 29:37 since he went live. grab some snacks or go do something, the stream will start soon™
[0:29:38] CritcobainTV: @Thoreya What makes you think that tweet has anything to do with the launch? They're just talking about alpha / beta stuff
[0:29:48] asdkl2312k3o: @FeralLikeMe its because they know they get more pre-orders close to wotlk AND they probably need the pre-orders for q3 or q4
[0:30:08] Thoreya: bc theyre saying theyre far into development and theyve been working on it for years? and theres no player power so maybe they need less time to test?
[0:30:10] jake9989: jake9989 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:30:11] Thoreya: @Critcobain

[0:30:43] dwolters_the_zombieman: @lilwaldo hi
[0:30:49] Malitor: Beta lasts 6 months usually and they haven't started Alpha yet
[0:30:54] asdkl2312k3o: They are saving the preorders for when microsoft is in charge to get better numbers
[0:31:03] CritcobainTV: I'm doing alright
[0:31:05] asdkl2312k3o: q3 q4
[0:31:34] HaxzorJimDuggan: microsoft is in charge june of next year so thats false
[0:31:39] sean85214: uptime!
[0:31:48] CritcobainTV: Yeah i don't see us getting 10.0 this year, we still have season 4 to get through, wotlk launch is this year confirmed. No shot we get 10.0 this year
[0:32:21] Thoreya: meh. august wrath 10.0 nov cud work
[0:33:30] EvilStreak: @Critcobain if i had to bet, 10.0 will be like June'ish 2023
[0:33:31] Thoreya: alpha would need to be may tho if there was any chance of that happening
[0:33:41] Thoreya: june 2023?!?!!?
[0:33:55] EvilStreak: thats just my guess
[0:33:56] CritcobainTV: we still have to do alpha, and beta lasts for ages. yeah the xpac may be pretty far along but i can't see them dropping it this year, they'll probably use wotlk to boost their numbers for q 3/4 and then dragonflight for the start of next year
[0:34:04] CritcobainTV: Im feeling march / april
[0:34:16] Thoreya: i think people vastly underestimat blizz. everyone thought SL was gonna be 2021 and it was nov 2020
[0:34:22] Thoreya: getting strong similar vibes rn
[0:35:06] Sollice: Nah Q1 2023
[0:35:10] warrenny: @thoreya Yeah but after what theyve said it siunds like theyll take longer to make to better
[0:35:20] EvilStreak: either way WotLK is this year so that's fun :D
[0:35:24] warrenny: Was thinking February ish
[0:35:30] Kasuo6: Yeah I'm feeling Q1 2023
[0:35:35] dwolters_the_zombieman: yeah SL came out in 2020 and look what happened to that expansion

[0:59:08] Deadcells: Ya I cant watch anymore dragonflight videos for the rest of the week. I spent the last 3 days watching stuff
[0:59:12] dwolters_the_zombieman: coconut is way too over powering can't stand it in drinks
[0:59:17] SPIKEe34: !origin
[0:59:23] GamerKillance: We'll see the beta by december and the expansion inApril-May
[0:59:27] GamerKillance: My guess
[0:59:51] magemaster225: german interview
[0:59:51] rothmir: @ScurvyHyam Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:00:02] TheDangerrZone: Are we excited for wrath classic? :)
[1:00:13] ArcaneSyntax: I think end of may.
[1:00:14] pacificmc1: nah its end of may :)
[1:00:16] itscityboy: so they must have teams working on future expansions at the same time
[1:00:21] dracullus: schedule as usual and people are panicking
[1:00:27] bigb0ngrip: haven't played in a bit, can I go straight from 0 legendary pieces to 291? if I have the gold
[1:00:32] GamerKillance: So basically Ion confirmed Shadowlands wasn't the priority in development. That explains a lot. Sounds like Shadowlands got the WoD treatment
[1:00:37] ScurvyHyam: Anytime there @Vox_Iz_Here
[1:00:37] brewgamingtv: I think they said they wanted to get the talent tree's out before alpha/beta so they could start getting feedback early
[1:00:39] Aervyper: @Towelliee you see Outriders is getting a DLC?
[1:00:42] Heero_Effect: @itscityboy accoCopee
[1:00:43] Alepouditsa: yea i think 2023 will next expesion will hit
[1:00:43] ArcaneSyntax: to be fair end of may is close to june anyway.
[1:00:43] asdkl2312k3o: @pacificmc1 yeah, this sounds like its super close but they dont want to give an date if things changes
[1:00:59] Mitune: talent calculators
[1:01:00] brewgamingtv: on the website
[1:01:08] pacificmc1: @Jerchof Yeah I feel like they are  targetting end of 2022 release too, which is why no release date because they  are scared of announcing it publicly if they won't make it
[1:01:10] brewgamingtv: yeah
[1:01:13] Clicklesly: @bigb0ngrip If you also farm enough Flux sure ^^
[1:01:13] dwolters_the_zombieman: wrath classic I'm exited for that too
[1:01:16] PvtHudson093: a talent calculator Pog
[1:01:17] Mitune: but I do believe they should PTR test that shit asap
[1:01:24] mavericks312: also i would like a definition of far along
[1:01:27] SPIKEe34: !ORIGIN
[1:01:36] lithium364: @Towelliee  Ion also said in that interview that the size of the dragon isles rivals Northend
[1:01:39] Thoreya: i see alpha coming next month
[1:01:52] asdkl2312k3o: @pacificmc1 idd cuz they had to postpone shadowlands last time, so they are probably want to be super safe this time
[1:01:53] reggiepowa: catJAM
[1:01:57] pacificmc1: @lithium364 It's actually bigger than Northend, at least according to their senior quest designer
[1:01:59] Mitune: It is clear that the talent system is going to be big back bone of this expansion so the sooner we can test is better imo
[1:01:59] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple

[1:02:12] bigb0ngrip: @clicklesly damn so much catching up, just got 80 renown and on the 5th sanctum quest.
[1:02:31] fewyn: i kind of like it being the "system" of the expansion
[1:02:32] pacificmc1: @dracullus 4  zones is not a lot. TBC had 11, Wrath had 10
[1:02:33] Razztaman: Im soo exited for wotlk classic
[1:02:38] Clicklesly: Didn't they say they'll post the talents before PTR even or something like that?
[1:02:45] MarquisLek: what comes after max level?
[1:02:48] WoW_StandalonE: KEKW
[1:02:57] WoW_StandalonE: @MarquisLek the end

[1:03:09] dracullus: @pacificmc1 look what I quoted
[1:03:19] sLogOG: borrowed power is out, borrowed mount is in with the new dragon flying thing LUL
[1:03:27] pacificmc1: @dracullus ah fair
[1:03:34] Deadcells: I’m so happy. I hope they never bring Legion to Shadowlands systems back.
[1:03:40] dwolters_the_zombieman: wrath to me maid hunters better in my opinion
[1:03:41] mavericks312: i mean tier sets alone is adding on to it tbf
[1:03:51] ScurvyHyam: domination shards

[1:13:17] xSoldierhardx: @towelliee why cant u skip the maw intro. Is this a new acct or something. As long as u did it on one toon u can skip
[1:13:17] lilwaldo: Did my man just say almond cheese?
[1:13:25] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee EVE Online just announced they're raising the sub costs to $19.00 USD a month lol
[1:13:27] WhiteKnight74648: Making me hungry
[1:13:29] DuploThief: @Towelliee make a misdirect macro to send all threat to your pet
[1:13:37] Kelbzter: Sounds like it LUL
[1:13:39] LordKain73: you normally misdirect to your pet

[1:15:39] Deadcells: Nice we are stuck on Heroic Andy. We have a small group and the Fight isn’t easy with a small group
[1:15:41] 1Loremaster: WOW Sub is $19.99 in Aus
[1:15:42] dreamwalker213: Omg players would flip shit
[1:15:43] Brodih_: 25% increase almost
[1:15:48] sSaemu: i mean here in canada i pay 18,37 for a wow sub --
[1:15:48] c0mmander_starscream: Pearl Abyss owns them and they need money
[1:15:50] Shamwise: Most would pay more for WOW
[1:15:50] Aervyper: inflation is up to 6.7%
[1:15:52] fewyn: @Towelliee his adjustment reflects global trends impacting general production costs and accounts for years of inflation, amending the 1-month USD subscription rate for the first time since 2004. These adjustments will have an impact on other currencies.
[1:15:53] essaje5us: china
[1:15:54] pacificmc1: @zentribe Because different currency? It's 100 kroners where I live. Different currency also.
[1:15:59] raldrik: Blizz payed them to do it to see what may happen if they do it with WoW lol
[1:16:00] Zachoowi: @zentribe American Dollar not thesame as Aus dollar ya doofus
[1:16:01] MarquisLek: because capitalism is a fickle mistress and her strap on has grown 3 inches
[1:16:06] YNR_Chewmiester: bro, 4 dollars is a Taco Bell burrito. No thank you
[1:16:13] pacificmc1: @zentribe 20 AUD = 14.5 USD
[1:16:20] Rottencoarse: bless u
[1:16:20] fewyn: just because
[1:16:25] vulkankragon: @SamuNA_ you are paying token price

[1:16:35] 1Loremaster: @pacificmc1 No, it used to be $15 before SL
[1:16:42] PipTown: hardcore eve players dont pay subs they use isk to buy the sub like wow tokens
[1:16:46] pacificmc1: @zentribe Well it's 14.57 right now :)
[1:16:47] Trif0ld: eve has some cool massive pvp battles
[1:16:52] Lorilath: My titan is still sat doing nothing in eve has been for like 2 years
[1:17:03] Ravager1240: if t hey raised it I would unsub
[1:17:10] Zoldrek: Zoldrek subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:17:14] reggiepowa: blizzard has no need to increase sub prices considering how much token makes them already
[1:17:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: they day some asshole destroyed my mining vessel in a high security zone after I spent days making money to buy it, i noped out for life from Eve
[1:17:16] swordart2022: I think they increase cause not many are playing EvE
[1:17:16] 1Loremaster: @pacificmc1 that's not how it works lol.. not everything is directly converted to USD
[1:17:22] MetalManGG: metalm30Hi Towelliee, metalm30Hi chat
[1:17:23] Teknofear64: I've been playing with tokens for like 3 years
[1:17:27] mrpresbaby: Only way I'd pay more is if they give us more alt friendly stuff and free gold with the sub
[1:17:29] Brodih_: i tried 2-3 times to get into EVE but the game is way too overwhelming
[1:17:30] honkblarg: the token is 20 bucks so lol
[1:17:32] pacificmc1: @zentribe LMAO
[1:17:32] YNR_Chewmiester: Bro, I took a year off of WoW once and didn't cancel my subscription. $17 wouldn't be noticed lol
[1:17:41] Mitune: Token probably actually lowers the chance of them increasing the price of the sub. Sorta pushes the sub price increase onto the whales
[1:17:41] shanks_blank: @Towelliee will you play the new wow class ?
[1:18:10] Zansteh: the free mount is really nice
[1:18:12] Just2Nasty801: yup battle pass lol.

[1:25:30] ShaggyDoobieDoo: what color would you use for the black dragonflight nanoleaf
[1:25:34] CritcobainTV: Hell no you wont, Good luck killing 10 rares without flying in ZM @Towelliee
[1:25:40] kokochris: need someone to help for the ZM;  those rare's are dead in < 30sec
[1:25:44] raldrik: yeah BFA still needs pathfinder right

[1:26:04] CritcobainTV: yeah but now everyone else has flying, so you'll never get tehre unless someone fly su around
[1:26:06] fewyn: i just camped a rare
[1:26:32] Broomba: BfA you have to unlock pathfinder to fly in bfa
[1:26:36] thaurman: if the revamped default Ui will be good I think I just dump my Elvui
[1:26:37] Molehj: @YNR_Chewmiester tbf now Rossi has retired I dont know who any of the riders are LUL
[1:26:40] zeitgeiz: Yeah, I can barely make it to rares before they are dead on a flying mount
[1:26:42] mulaaa_2x: when u doing dungeons

[1:29:24] CritcobainTV: SL. BFA had more dungeons that were annoying as fuck
[1:29:30] itscityboy: hot take
[1:29:44] DrakeDuude: whats your thoughts on it
[1:29:56] BTiZZY_: going back and doing legion time walking dungeons made me realize how meh SL dungeons were to me which is why i asked
[1:30:09] mrpresbaby: YES!
[1:30:14] DrakeDuude: 42 min dungeons suck
[1:30:15] ArcaneSyntax: the BFA dungeons were pretty good.
[1:30:21] Karbonn: Longer dungeons just feel like a slog.
[1:30:24] mrpresbaby: If I could get 4 doubles done in like 2 hours that'd be great
[1:30:30] fewyn: 30 minutes is about the sweet spot for dungeons i agree
[1:30:36] rapstah: 20-30min dungeons would be great
[1:30:41] rapstah: 40mins taking the piss
[1:31:02] mrpresbaby: feels even worse when you fail the key and it's like an hour
[1:31:13] PvtHudson093: Mists or Gambit
[1:31:14] DrakeDuude: agreed
[1:31:15] Capo367: I like how recent FF dungeons feel. But yea, the 40min dungeons zzzzzzzzzzzz
[1:31:26] mrpresbaby: look at maw of souls
[1:31:30] raldrik: I feel like I can never run a DOS life always gets in the way
[1:31:32] mrpresbaby: it was a great dungeon and super short
[1:31:37] YNR_Chewmiester: Wailing Caverns vibes
[1:31:40] SonofHorus82: give me 2 hour BRD!
[1:31:50] IianaDRK: i love the idea of it. it makes older dungeons relevant again, and stops m+ getting stale or annoying as the expansion goes on
[1:31:57] szeeman62: @towelliee just started a hunter been playing marksmanship gonna try survival at a higher level when do you feel like survival gets interesting
[1:32:06] IianaDRK: give me M+ ZA and ZG
[1:32:09] SonofHorus82: LF Tank for M20 BRD!
[1:32:12] YNR_Chewmiester: @sonofhorus82 BRD is kinda fun tho
[1:32:13] Niksen_99: watched and liked your 9 to 5 video really cool
[1:32:33] Arocian: That would be great
[1:32:41] Arocian: Need a few more
[1:32:46] mavericks312: 8 at launch he said so hopefully
[1:32:55] DrakeDuude: ya i want all fresh new dungeons. old dungeons should be "side dungeons" that are available
[1:32:56] xSoldierhardx: Wat is that exp bar addon on top
[1:33:03] OathXP: I loved how legion added 1 in Tomb and 1 in Argus after Karazhan
[1:33:07] rapstah: id rather 6 really well made new dungeons
[1:33:11] OathXP: that accompanied the expanding story
[1:33:13] K0rzak0v: @xSoldierhardx weakaura from luxthos
[1:33:13] The_Metal_Man: every major patch should ship with 2+ new dungoens, or at the very least the patches in between raid tier patches
[1:33:23] Thoreya: its so sad how much i liked bfa zones now that im reflecting back
[1:33:23] taelson16: !Dragonflight
[1:33:28] The_Metal_Man: if they can make a raid every patch they can make another couple dungeons
[1:33:33] taelson16: !YT DRAGONFLIGHT

[1:34:17] DrakeDuude: yes
[1:34:26] MethmM: i agree with u, u want everything new at the beginnning
[1:34:27] CritcobainTV: Nobody wants to start an expac and not be able to do half the content, that's weird
[1:34:34] DrakeDuude: exactly
[1:34:35] jkitchin75: can you solo legion raids yet
[1:34:37] kokochris: agree
[1:34:45] Mitune: I hate Shadowpan sooo much
[1:34:48] sakura_2020: @jkitchin75 yep
[1:34:52] DeanoTV: OR make it 6 NEW dungeons and 3 old
[1:34:52] rapstah: yeah its strange tbh, especially if they keep the dungeons u dont like
[1:34:54] Qargory: it should be: S1 all 8 dragon isles, S2 4 DF and 4 old, S3 other 4 DF and 4 mroe old ones
[1:34:55] Anolith23: Season 1 - All new dungeons Season 2 - 4 Old dungeons included Season 3 - 4 Different old dungeons

[1:35:24] Qargory: yes
[1:35:25] maalow: yes
[1:35:25] The_Metal_Man: i hope they don't take dungeons from before legion tho - there's not enough mechanics to make those dungeons hard enough
[1:35:27] ArcaneSyntax: yes
[1:35:28] mavericks312: yea
[1:35:29] Scoodles91: yes
[1:35:30] Frostfury: Yes
[1:35:30] Dinosew: @Towelliee how are you liking Survival? Do you switch between weapons at all or just stay polearm?
[1:35:40] Qargory: survival 4p PUMPS too
[1:35:43] DeanoTV: @The_Metal_Man imagine ragefire M+ though Pog
[1:35:44] Draz3nx: are the charges coming faster
[1:35:50] ArcaneSyntax: I just rammed an alt through chapter 4 of the campaign and immediately got 2 pc.

[1:37:50] IianaDRK: 5 players? or 1 huntery boi
[1:38:07] jhopps12: as soon as he said "no borrowed borrow, we are making current systems better" he became everyone's favorite person LUL
[1:38:14] luckfore: ions answer to the sword of sargeras tho KEKW

[1:39:41] PToastman: Lol he wants names
[1:39:51] PToastman: Haters gonna hate
[1:39:53] xXSiebzehnXx: Same
[1:39:54] The_Metal_Man: hopefully microsoft opens their wallet a bit, hires more staff for more content

[1:40:05] MarquisLek: yeah i totally dug it too
[1:40:15] MarquisLek: artifact power is legit
[1:40:17] danimoto10: I would love another artifact tbh
[1:40:22] Capo367: Instead of being borrowed, its now ours
[1:40:32] tofuthief123: Is there a list of his addons?
[1:40:36] Heero_Effect: Technically isn’t tier sets borrowed power?
[1:40:36] Dirtnose: artifact weapons still one of my favourite things in wow ever
[1:40:41] MOLAR305: I love that shit will not be useless after the expansion
[1:40:53] luckfore: we will also learn new talents as max level content
[1:40:55] tofuthief123: !addon
[1:40:55] CritcobainTV: I blame Towelliee, we all know he decides waht goes in the game

[1:40:58] JFeezy__: there was definitely some good with the bad in there
[1:41:00] MOLAR305: How I miss twilight devastation
[1:41:00] Qargory: none of it was bad, it just felt bad when you leave that expac
[1:41:03] ahies28: @mourningztar its luxthos's lvling weak aura
[1:41:10] myfunkyself: So they getting rid this time gated stuff omg thank god
[1:41:10] aleksmetha: i would like to know wat the day to day open world content will look like
[1:41:12] MarquisLek: i think of borrowed power as a system to gain power that isn't gear dependent or level dependent
[1:41:14] raldrik: Wonder if a from of TD will make it to any tank trees
[1:41:18] Broomba: i guess im asking its a relief to do a new expansion with no expectations on power to character based on the system - ion looks soo relieved and free
[1:41:20] Merqury3: it was made a lot worse for people who didnt have much time in the day to play the game
[1:41:36] comp1: now if only we can get new world fishing in wow
[1:41:41] JansonLives: Once unlocked I've been loving covenants. Being able to swap freely is awesome. I've been progressing this raid as all 3 specs of shammy.
[1:41:42] Qargory: isnt tier still technically borrowed power though?
[1:41:47] AtomJar: new interview talks about the possibility of maybe adding an extra talent point post max lvl or having gear that adds a +1 to talents etc. kinda cool there looking that way instead of other stuff
[1:41:57] ahies28: @qargory Yes
[1:42:02] Ziephier: Ziephier subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:42:07] Sollice: @Qargory Not really if it stays consistent
[1:42:11] CYNIC308: idk the whole rare/treasure grabbing and the artifact / azerite / anima / aspet grind was what made the game unfun ... build the world make cool quests make npcs more interactive make the world more alive
[1:42:20] Very_Stickyrice: why does your graphics look so much better than mine?!?
[1:42:33] Watch_Me_Nuke: !YT

[1:42:37] Deadcells: It’s early
[1:42:47] j3pp3tt0: Dragonflight looks great imo
[1:42:51] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee What about the scrapper, would you like that to return?
[1:42:53] mavericks312: the fact that we get tier at the start is amazing
[1:42:54] shiingocrates: catJAM
[1:42:55] j3pp3tt0: I love blizzard trailers
[1:42:55] jhopps12: tier is borrowed power. that's good borrow power imo. the BP we won't see this xpac is the cosmic borrowed power like covenants, according to Ion
[1:42:57] PToastman: The world boss drops 256 plate chest and helm. Plate wearers pop those in the catalyst and are dancing
[1:42:58] CritcobainTV: I really hope tier sets in dragonflight aren't tradeable at all until you loot that specific one or have tier of a higher ilvl Kappa
[1:43:11] Dirtnose: I wonder if the new talent system will allow shaman tanking
[1:43:19] racketpunch: Do you think they’re trying to bring classic players back into retail since that will eventually come to an end?
[1:43:28] Arocian: I wonder if there will be a new version of torghast in dragonflight
[1:43:32] MetaKuron: Gear is borrowed power
[1:43:38] ahies28: @jhopps12 also leggos
[1:43:40] Niksen_99: What different zones did you choose on since level 1 ?
[1:43:43] luckfore: @towelliee about the sword in silithus he said that at this point its just a splinter, everything is fine  LUL
[1:43:57] Heero_Effect: Technically deez nuts are borrowed power
[1:43:59] jhopps12: I guess everything can be seen as borrowed lol
[1:44:02] danimoto10: did you saw ion talked about the sword?
[1:44:04] MarquisLek: are they reverting emissaries and world quests back to legion or continuing with that shadowlands pick up the quest bullshit
[1:44:07] maxkule: @Towelliee Do you think no LFG in Classic is going to do more harm than good in WotLK?
[1:44:13] Grimmerino90: i mean - gear & trinkets are borrowed power - people need to stop with the borrowed power / sytsems ptsd
[1:44:15] Velashen: People were not bothered with tier. It’s simple and it works. The systems they started creating afterward were bloated.
[1:44:18] uglla3np: the term borrowed power kind of felt like propaganda. suddenly it came up and everyone was using it. stuff like that sucks imo, people hopping the band waggon
[1:44:23] ahies28: leggos are borrowed power
[1:44:35] JanPhilip: @maxkule There is LFG, you mean LFR right?
[1:44:40] rivera9: but the Legion Borrowed Power was so strong, i could SOLO mythic Zeros in LEGION
[1:44:47] mavericks312: @maxkule its gonna do alot of harm
[1:44:47] CYNIC308: corruption gambling?
[1:44:49] SmallzzIV: tier sets also continue to function moving forward they just become weaker...
[1:44:54] ShaggyDoobieDoo: whats cool is that some of the beloved borrowed power from covenants will be integrated in the new talent system
[1:45:04] maxkule: @JanPhilip No LFG came in 3.3, they said they will not be putting it in Clasix.
[1:45:15] Lethallin97: the problem is when borrowed power is used to fill in an incomplete spec, tier sets usually just adds a twist to an already finished class
[1:45:19] maxkule: @JanPhilip Classic*

[1:46:22] Draz3nx: use exhiliration
[1:46:29] ShaggyDoobieDoo: the covenant abilties were new and unique, cool way to test drive some new abilities. Blizz have the metrics to see which are the favorite

[1:46:59] maxkule: @Towelliee What do you think of Blizz removing LFG from WotLK?
[1:47:03] banned_play3r: and feign deatrh

[1:48:02] MethmM: it was in wrath they introduced heirloom gear right? ooo will be fun
[1:48:05] Ravager1240: that druid ws gonna help yo ukill that mob
[1:48:11] raye_gaming22: this is the kind of dungen we dont need in M+
[1:48:21] Molehj: Bruh
[1:48:30] SonofHorus82: the thing about LFD is that they said they took player feedback and removed it because of that. That doesnt seem like the consensus from the community on my server.
[1:48:45] jeflag: u know they mean business when they mark themselves w star
[1:48:56] rivera9: this was the  BEST M+ dungeon in BfA
[1:49:17] reggiepowa: no way this was the best dungeon
[1:49:24] reggiepowa: its freehold
[1:49:29] lithium364: classic rage andys
[1:49:31] kashmara: kashmara subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 26 month streak! 
[1:49:35] luckfore: they are also thinking about removing heirlooms

[1:49:36] SadDingus: mistake
[1:49:38] luckfore: in wotlk
[1:49:51] Zucchey: @Towelliee They should enable it from beginning, maybe only realm cross dungeon finder, not cross
[1:50:00] Fuuj: cant wait fpr bfa classic Kappa
[1:50:02] creazyTV: Well, I also wanna play WotLK and had wasn't ask for my feedback at all
[1:50:02] Zucchey: Middleground
[1:50:10] countrycount: weren't there like always people "if they put lfg in my classic it's DOA" and stuff?
[1:50:10] UnevenSolution: @Towelliee idk man... my social group and I are pretty happy its gone. will make it more engaging.
[1:50:19] stratiss: there is a fully functional LFG in BC right now it's just not automated and limited to server.
[1:50:22] hey_itsavery: It seems like they decided themselves to remove it, and said it was based on "player consensus" to make us think they're listening
[1:50:23] rivera9: @luckfore because it would cut into their proffits of ppl buyin boosts
[1:50:25] mavericks312: there listening to the hardcore candy player with huge followings that dont have to even use the feature and ignoring the casual aspect of it
[1:50:25] Deadcells: I’m not going to play wrath classic now because of that
[1:50:38] sl1nky1981: You don't HAVE to use the LFD tool. You are free to stand around in Dalaran and spam trade chat looking for a group. LUL
[1:50:44] swordart2022: Yuck Reddit
[1:50:46] Deatheran: was the LFD system actualy realm specific at the start... like i played on dark iron so i could only play with dark iron people
[1:50:46] SonofHorus82: luckily in my guild there's never an issue getting dungeon groups together.
[1:50:50] YNR_Chewmiester: I can't remember, but wasnt LFG added late expansion? That was so long ago, but I remember it being a game changer for sure. I personally hate sitting around in Trade/LFG chats
[1:51:01] YNR_Chewmiester: LFD*
[1:51:05] arturiuss44: They listening to OTK or something?
[1:51:10] CYNIC308: Towelliee did you ever play HPally? Im thinking of making one
[1:51:14] Karbonn: I havent been following much lately but when I heard no LFD because 'the community asked for it i was like..... Press X to DOUBT
[1:51:37] SadDingus: exactly
[1:51:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: more engaging for your social group
[1:51:46] Fuuj: I cant stand classic tbc because of people asking for abnormal gear for simple heroics.
[1:51:48] reggiepowa: you are walking to dungeons in retail as well, you dont use dungeon finder for important content
[1:51:53] Torwolf: Such a large section of the community spent time complaining about LFG. Funny how we see two sides of the coin here, they listen to one side and disrupt another side.
[1:51:53] Endin: I actually played the game back then - all it did was encourage trade chat spam instead of using a UI
[1:52:03] Heero_Effect: I think LFG is a good thing. I remember spaming chat to get a group.
[1:52:07] JFeezy__: taking out LFG is trash if thats really the plan.
[1:52:09] S1appadabass: @Towelliee i think most people who will play classic WOTLK are gonna be playing within their groups already, having LFD isnt gonna hurt anything
[1:52:10] Mordrathon: Dungeon finder really messed up the whole MMO experience for me
[1:52:11] Gargantix: !yt
[1:52:12] Moobot: @Gargantix Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || THE BIRTH OF CHADBOMB!! - WoW 9 to 5 Episode 1 youtu.be/8qc5QklRzIo
[1:52:17] reggiepowa: retail pretty much removed dungeon finder as well outside of lvling content
[1:52:19] UnevenSolution: @Towelliee KEK you walk to dung in retail for mythic + though??
[1:52:38] Arocian: yeah, if you like LFG and LFR use them. If you don't, don't use them.
[1:52:49] Mitune: Wouldnt be surprised if there is a survey for it
[1:52:50] ArcaneSyntax: honestly they should have added LFG into BC too.
[1:52:52] BigBigu: in fact, it's a bait from blizz, they didnt ask anyone. their survey is right now, they look at people reaction with the announcement of no LFG
[1:52:55] Gurtogg: What happend to the whole Wotlk ++ argument?
[1:52:58] mavericks312: again there only listening to the loud majority who have there groups/followings already you dont need to worry about trying to find a grp
[1:53:00] YNR_Chewmiester: @endin Same, I started in late 2007, early 2008 and all it does is cause clogged trade chat.
[1:53:09] Mahrquz: Yea the problem now with Wrath Classic is that you still will have a sort of Dungeon Finder via addons but with the added bonus that you will have to run to the dungeon
[1:53:23] Gurtogg: was really excited and now just dissapointed
[1:53:23] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[1:53:29] Niksen_99: Didnt blizzard only remove Dungeon Finder to sell level boosts ?
[1:53:32] tronbadgames: I think that guys statement about not needing LFD is the exact point - those who don’t need it, wont use it. Those who would like it - are speaking out, and it's pretty loud.
[1:53:32] SadDingus: back when i was still social in the game, in an active guild, raided etc, we still used LFD just because u couldnt always find a full group and it was just easier than spamming chat. didnt hurt the social aspect for me
[1:53:36] reggiepowa: @Mahrquz and the bonus that you can choose who you invite, like with retail custom group finder
[1:53:37] aumixp: @towelliee how many points are you away from 3k io?
[1:53:52] eatonaround: what expansion we leveling in?
[1:53:56] SadDingus: u want to form your own groups, get to know people, its still there
[1:54:03] reformedalex12345: @shutupRoman ye obviously the ones who want it are loud and majority who doesnt is quiet LUL
[1:54:08] SonofHorus82: was the dungeon journal in wrath?
[1:54:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard isn't adding dungeon finder because of complaining that it ruins the social fabric, or whatever
[1:54:17] CritcobainTV: @SonofHorus82 nah
[1:54:23] ArcaneSyntax: the other side of the LFG system is it makes leveling significantly faster which is what people leveling want.
[1:54:32] CozzyFlannel: I think they'll end up letting Drakthyr be other classes
[1:54:32] SilkeySmooth: no lfd not buying a boost
[1:54:39] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:54:40] YNR_Chewmiester: I still talked regularly with my LFD groups. Hell, there's a lot of times where you'll end up with the same players over multiple queues
[1:54:43] bigoldmeatpie: i want blood DPS back
[1:54:43] Scraggersmeh: Classic andies raged about not having RDF. That's who they listened to.
[1:54:44] DrakeDuude: oh ya
[1:54:46] reformedalex12345: its good that dungeon finder isnt there at start people would just spam dungeons in stormwind or orgrimmar because its faster to level... how do people not fucking get it NotLikeThis
[1:54:50] PhillyDilly18: Are they keeping the TBC dungeon finder tool? I would be okay if they at least kept that.
[1:54:50] fewyn: the wrathgate was SO GOOD
[1:54:57] Taevenx: Removing teams AND LFG was not on my WOLK Classic bingo card lol
[1:54:57] SadDingus: @YNR_Chewmiester yep
[1:54:58] swordart2022: You can do that in Shadowlands right now EZ
[1:55:03] fewyn: i wish we could get an updated wrathgate
[1:55:04] tkzod: weren't people complaining back in the day that because of LFD WOW declined?
[1:55:05] xXSiebzehnXx: Playing was almost breathless
[1:55:17] SonofHorus82: @critcobain dang. I guess I need to go read the DJ for tanking in retail then. haven't tanked since Wrath so time to refresh my mind.
[1:55:25] chappers04: wrath dungeons weren't as easy as they are now
[1:55:26] Heero_Effect: Wrath was a fun time
[1:55:26] SadDingus: @tkzod yes, i dont think it was the case tho
[1:55:27] BlackCl0ud: talking about wrath dungeons?
[1:55:41] tronbadgames: talking about LFD in wrath
[1:55:41] reggiepowa: dungeon finder for lvling is fine but it shouldnt be a thing at max lvl
[1:55:44] reformedalex12345: @chapperss4 true but they were piss easy compared to tbc heroics
[1:55:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: I tanked in Wrath with DK, it was a lot of fun
[1:55:51] Eviltuna13: As a healer play I can’t wait to see how the new class plays. I’m hoping for a Druid shaman hybrid
[1:55:58] Niksen_99: Maybe Blizzard will add dungeon finder once they sold enough level boosts @Towelliee
[1:55:59] xXSiebzehnXx: Gotta grind out 15000 rep tokens, go do it, gotta grind dungeons, do it
[1:56:00] ArcaneSyntax: spamming wrath dungeons for 8 hours straight after LFG came out for badges was fun as fuck
[1:56:01] swordart2022: I don't play classic I don't care people playing classic for not qol or they would play Shadowlands.
[1:56:04] rivera9: i'm waiting for M+ Oculous in Dragonflight Season 1
[1:56:04] straightbackorc: I think they are trying to differentiate classic from retail, since there is going to be more and more overlap as they progress through expansions
[1:56:07] Thoreya: with no lfg and no heirlooms in wrath im kinda out on that
[1:56:09] SonofHorus82: also super excited to run the Forge/Pit/Halls cycle a trillion times of Battered Hilt.
[1:56:12] IianaDRK: @chapperss4 dude ahn kahet was brutal at the start of the expansion
[1:56:16] Sollice: You have to have 80 reknown to purchase the 40 reknown catchup for alts...Lame
[1:56:20] SadDingus: @rivera9 hahah
[1:56:22] SilkeySmooth: not even  going to play classic wrath because of no lfd
[1:56:28] Russclarto: !nameplates
[1:56:40] BlackCl0ud: RDF made it way too easy in wrath imo
[1:56:44] Sollice: He is using Tiddy Plates
[1:56:47] Russclarto: !np
[1:56:49] BlackCl0ud: other than that it was ok
[1:56:55] ArcaneSyntax: speaking of wrath...
[1:56:56] Russclarto: ah thank you
[1:56:57] swordart2022: @sollice ye imagine playing the game
[1:57:09] SadDingus: the last 3 Wrath dungeons Blizz released were friggen hard at the start if u had tanks that didnt know the fights
[1:57:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm going to play Wrath regardless, but it's going to be harder for me to the weapon I need from Pit of Saron that I need for PvP
[1:57:31] JansonLives: I do not miss this dungeon at all. too much damn trash
[1:57:31] Sollice: @fairplay2021 Or imagine, coming back to the game and switching from a character who had at the time max reknown 40 and switching to an alt that has 0 reknown with the new convent they chose?
[1:57:33] SilkeySmooth: no lfd not buying any boosts
[1:57:35] Norian45: !yt dragonflight

[1:57:39] swordart2022: COPIUM usage is big in chat KEKW
[1:57:43] IianaDRK: im going to revive my frost dk dual wield tank in wrath classic
[1:57:50] hey_itsavery: I do like that we're getting DKs in prepatch and don't require a max level toon
[1:57:50] kodtheog: Ru excited for wrath?
[1:57:54] BlackCl0ud: wrath on warmane pserver was amazing and best wow experience i had. content was hella buffed up
[1:57:56] Kize_Gaming: slootI slootCopium
[1:58:05] swordart2022: @sollice what is your point,just said you don't play
[1:58:11] tronbadgames: it's just classic andys thinking any system that wasnt in classic shouldn't be in wrath.. which doesnt make sense
[1:58:13] xsp00n: In blizz's defense, 99% of people that want it wont play enough for it to be meaningful enough for them to add it, when the active classics community dont want it
[1:58:16] CYNIC308: why lvl 70 tho i mean the lvl 58 boost would have been perfect to lvl up with all the DKs
[1:58:20] reformedalex12345: @Biby07 yeah it was people just didnt know about that yet
[1:58:23] SonofHorus82: Towelliee gonna get to Algalon and peace out.
[1:58:24] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: what patch they going back to? will blood dks be dps and not tanks?
[1:58:26] Heero_Effect: Addiction to WoW accoCopee
[1:58:37] MOLAR305: i am pretty sure i could do wrath dungeons with my eyes closed at this point lol
[1:58:37] reformedalex12345: @grifffon propably 3.3.5
[1:58:42] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: if so sign me up!
[1:58:43] Sollice: @fairplay2021 What?? I just said I am coming back playing a character that was an alt.
[1:58:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Denying us a quality of life tool because they don't feel it's good for us....it's lame
[1:58:47] IianaDRK: @shutupRoman to be fair there is an argument to be made that adding LFG for convenience came at the cost of some social interaction
[1:58:49] Sollice: !plater
[1:58:49] Moobot: @Sollice Towelliee's Plater Addon Profile - https://wago.io/1ZozQnKxj
[1:58:53] kodtheog: Dragonflight looks decent too like a safe expansion
[1:58:58] Sollice: He uses Platter for name plates and thats his profle
[1:59:02] GriFFFoN_ZGZ: blood dps was so fun
[1:59:03] swordart2022: @sollice so you don't have things normal
[1:59:15] Sollice: @fairplay2021 huh?
[1:59:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: J. Allen Brack was right that spamming trade chat looking for tanks is awful....and it's going to happen again
[1:59:38] Mitune: ^
[2:00:10] tronbadgames: @shutupRoman true, back then. Forcing social interaction is weird when it just means running to a dungeon. finding a group isn't very social..
[2:00:18] Mitune: id kill for shaman tank in wotlk but I know it aint happening
[2:00:24] reformedalex12345: @weirdo_dude i would propably add dungeon finder in 10-70 but not above that just for the sake of people leveling in zones
[2:00:36] SonofHorus82: seeing the words "J Allen Brack was right" makes me want to vomit out my insides.
[2:00:48] Ispintowin: You are always my favorite tank on twitch @towelliee
[2:00:56] belfastcl: @SonofHorus82 same
[2:00:56] mmrghost7: the fact that it has new class guarantees sub raise
[2:00:58] Molehj: Stoney Tony is the big bad all along
[2:01:07] tronbadgames: @Towelliee dragons go raaawr, we go raaawr, end of expansion gg
[2:01:09] rivera9: onyxia 4.0?
[2:01:09] Swoophy: Do you still do the mog/dance off in ICC?

[2:06:12] raldrik: new player, new account, newbie issues combo with hunter things. Seems like a valid 9-5 to me
[2:06:18] Scraggersmeh: @Mitune  It's been replaced by "Big Splinter" meme.

[2:31:11] Amarlian: What if they did not do account wide rep but unlocked the rewards account wide. Kind of the same thing but for those who want to earn the rep on each alt, it still works @Towelliee
[2:31:28] chrslp: I always thought Wowhead was its own site. Didnt know a huge company like tencent owned them
[2:31:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah
[2:31:37] Clicklesly: "read goodies" Was that supposed to be "read guides"? :-I
[2:31:54] Velashen: It was always like that really. I know I looked up builds at the start of the game.
[2:32:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Respec costs were freaking horrible
[2:32:17] Mitune: Clap
[2:32:18] EKS90_: I think this entire wowhead post was really good, very good openness from blizz and felt actually good to read for once.
[2:32:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: These loadouts are going to be very nice to have
[2:33:00] raldrik: At the very least they get it.
[2:33:10] therotkiw: clappa clappa
[2:33:10] endobleedz: only took 15 yrs
[2:33:13] Grunton: they making good changes
[2:33:21] StaticSpoon: Clap
[2:33:35] Layercake: 10+ years to finally come to such a simple conclusion
[2:33:39] SilkeySmooth: i can agree with that
[2:33:43] NEMERL: +1
[2:33:44] swordart2022: TRUE
[2:33:45] Clicklesly: It just seems like anything that ties into player power they don't want to make acct wide ^^
[2:33:46] BlackCl0ud: or just make the items from the vendor account-wide, makes more sense
[2:33:52] Nightshaft25: Clap
[2:33:53] endobleedz: that would make rep gear worth then
[2:33:59] slowfetch: what kind of psycho wants to earn rep if you already have the rewards?
[2:34:03] BlackCl0ud: you buy items with your main for your alt
[2:34:04] Sollice: @MANFLESH Calm down friend
[2:34:05] littleofc1: yes or the mount or whatever
[2:34:22] TeejayOCE: If you can buy the exalted rewards on an alt theres no points to earning the rep still though lol
[2:35:18] Velashen: Yeah that ZM poco tree is garbage not being account wide. Otherwise would be fun.
[2:35:21] swordart2022: True
[2:35:22] Amarlian: @KaRnizor Some people love to fill bars OR for the older system of maxing out exulted but still getting rewards each bar fill past it
[2:35:46] 3663Sharad: towLets towGo
[2:35:48] MetalJoshP: Facts
[2:35:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Once is enough for grinds
[2:35:54] TeejayOCE: @Amarlian yeh true people do love to see numbers get higher haha
[2:35:55] Aro725: 0 chance, they said they dont like account wide power related things
[2:35:57] Megacozm: true
[2:36:00] mavericks312: I'm telling you ion is finally free
[2:36:01] JFeezy__: Literally, one grind and then let me have fun playing other toons.
[2:36:07] ObsidianHealer: I'm more of a one character andy, dont care for alts..
[2:36:18] 3663Sharad: 3663Sharad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:36:19] ObsidianHealer: but i agree that everything should be acount wide
[2:36:22] MetalJoshP: Main = grind Alt = fun
[2:36:27] EKS90_: I usually play 2 chars maybe 3, and that has been very annoying recently
[2:36:31] IianaDRK: wonder if theyre open to bringing back reforging or making jewelcrafting relevant like it used to be
[2:36:35] EKS90_: so i have kinda stopped doing it, and that sucks
[2:36:38] sl1nky1981: Really love that I can level tier gear that I get from M+
[2:36:56] Nightshaft25: thats why alts exists i dont to tryhard for my alt..no thank you
[2:37:00] SicDogg: is DF out this year ??
[2:37:02] PokerFaceMoose: yeah
[2:37:12] faulen: yeah I think so
[2:37:15] Mitune: possibly maybe even some stuff from things like Ascension wow
[2:37:15] PokerFaceMoose: or in original gW you do stuff to unlock skills
[2:37:22] CYNIC308: Librams?
[2:37:23] Doublezoh: or like in lost ark
[2:37:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Adding more talent points after max level could work
[2:37:27] MetalJoshP: Paragon system
[2:37:32] ItsBorland: @SicDogg nobody knows but people are assuiming q1/q2 of next year
[2:37:46] SicDogg: @BorlandBTW ty
[2:37:50] KodyTheTyger: Sounds similar to Wildstar’s earnable talent points and I’m all for it.
[2:38:02] Nightshaft25: towHAMUP
[2:38:04] nilachip: PoE talent tree
[2:38:08] mavericks312: @sicdogg the safe bet is January or febr
[2:38:09] faulen: yes please
[2:38:13] honkblarg: its gonna turn into PoE talents
[2:38:20] Amarlian: "UI Update, added a scroll bar to the right hand side"
[2:38:30] Rtreed1994: Rtreed1994 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:38:31] FannyPackGirl: talent trees just feel good idc if there will be cookie cutter builds
[2:38:33] MetalJoshP: Make it like for every raid wing you get another talent point
[2:38:33] Nightshaft25: PoE Talent Tree LUL
[2:38:35] Broomba: you need 3 27 monitors to see entire talent tree @towelliee KEKW
[2:38:55] bigoldmeatpie: same

[2:41:05] ObsidianHealer: PoE talent tree laynaPeek
[2:41:10] justincb29: when is this xpac gonna drop?
[2:41:12] ijuki: @kaelibwow 15 is too much... 10 fps max
[2:41:17] MILESkg21: ObsidianHealer PLZ NO WutFace
[2:41:19] Amarlian: @ursinealli Hey that's just how I play RPGs. Gotta save them for the end boss
[2:41:27] Buckwink: sure a lot of people will use cookie-cutter builds but there are people who will create some crazy-ass builds like the old days
[2:41:30] notColt45: 15 if standing still in a secluded area
[2:41:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: i still remember the name of player that made my arcanite reaper in vanilla
[2:42:01] slowfetch: unpopular opinion but the talent trees will just get mathed. i can promise you heroic-mythic raiders just pick the "best" one
[2:42:12] gonzalortb: !yt

[2:42:14] Tbuck92: theyre datamined before people play them anyway KEKW
[2:42:17] MILESkg21: Spoiler free wow KEKW
[2:42:30] UnknownLegendDPS: spoilers D:
[2:42:40] Heero_Effect: Lol but the story is shit I just want to get it over with to do what I want which is raid
[2:42:42] dreamwalker213: @slowfetch yeah but now you can have like 7 "best" loadouts for every specific situation
[2:42:52] swordart2022: Who is on Reddit KEKW
[2:42:56] Velashen: Ffxiv feels that pain hard.
[2:43:00] Mitune: It is a miracle that ff14 community pulls it off
[2:43:01] Maytan26: but how does ffxiv does this
[2:43:04] slowfetch: ill believe that when i see it.
[2:43:08] Thoreya: i stopped using r/wow years ago best decision
[2:43:24] kaelibwow: @slowfetch sure but that’s not the point, the point is you can swap around for other activities, arenas, m+, farming, speed runs, rbgs
[2:43:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: They hate spoilers yeah
[2:43:43] MILESkg21: Happy loses a shit ton of viewers on launch week
[2:43:48] Amarlian: FFXIV people watching streams know how to use smiles
[2:43:49] Heero_Effect: FF14 no one cares lmao
[2:43:56] ghst_WLF: They usually skip MSQ cutscenes
[2:43:59] bigoldmeatpie: the ff14 community also actively protects everyone against spoilers
[2:44:06] Pritamin: also nobody cares for ff story :D
[2:44:09] Urnie09: @slowfetch who cares tho? there will always be a meta. and there will always be different builds and meme builds. just have fun man
[2:44:15] Grunton: hell yeah
[2:44:18] icycateye: still like ff14 more where i can do all the story at once
[2:44:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa, leaning away from timegating
[2:44:22] MILESkg21: this mufucka said NOBODY CARES KEKW
[2:44:25] Heero_Effect: @bigoldmeatpie not really I had it spoiled
[2:44:34] Schlong_John_Silva: 2 week ban for legendary bug feelsgoodman
[2:44:40] Mitune: ITs mainly the harassments you get from other over not meta @Urnie09
[2:45:09] kaelibwow: Time hating on any online game is essential, gives you something to care about on reset
[2:45:09] raldrik: seems like they will or even expand on it
[2:45:11] Kisswani: I'm for it if it makes sense
[2:45:11] Gotxiko: like wings in icc?
[2:45:24] Velashen: @mileskg21 they probably said the same about wow a month ago haha.
[2:45:26] SilkeySmooth: dragonflight is looking to be the best expansion in years
[2:45:29] ijuki: First 4 bosses are open ... then the rest bosses opens up Kappa
[2:45:31] LawnSpeaker: There should be more than a single story thread progressing at a time
[2:45:38] Mitune: It makes sense as long as they can tie it to the story well
[2:45:52] bigoldmeatpie: @Heero_Effect definitely happens, but as a whole the community in streams will try and get rid of spoilers as quickly as possible and not answer any questions. that's why the :-) is a meme
[2:45:54] MILESkg21: Velashen true 4Head
[2:45:55] jrooke1992: Do you think they are going to add more Heritage armours? Really did enjoy the ones we have got same feelings from Artifact weapons
[2:46:03] Elindalyne: half the time in SL it felt like the campaign was a week or two behind the raid in terms of story...
[2:46:07] justincb29: what character are you gonna boost on the 9-5 account?
[2:46:26] Traumatize77: !factor

[2:46:56] MetalJoshP: Give us a 40 man raid or boss just for fun lol
[2:47:00] instinctdt: dodging the question :(
[2:47:13] nilachip: legendary ion dodging
[2:47:23] SilkeySmooth: and a lfd to m+1-m+5 at least
[2:47:38] MILESkg21: BIG TRUE
[2:47:38] ObsidianHealer: true
[2:47:42] Layercake: 100%
[2:47:44] swordart2022: True preach
[2:47:53] Snabido: Wait, I am my own person? D:
[2:47:53] maxmorey: I think Retail is too steeped in that mindset, while Classic is a chance to see a different path, kinda different products entirely at this point imo
[2:47:58] Mitune: forcing a bit of social stuff does help nudge people towards it but yeah true
[2:47:59] kokochris: yup for sure
[2:48:04] Weegleman: all by my seeeeelf baddBIGCRY
[2:48:05] kaelibwow: Biggest thing I am seeing is mythic isn’t the only real endgame anymore, even PvP is getting endgame love
[2:48:15] EmpathyLiveChat: I agree
[2:48:18] Kisswani: Most of the people complaining online about the like of social aspects and blame it on blizzard are usually not the type of people I would want to hang out with anyway KEKW
[2:48:20] raldrik: I wonder if they could do LFR achievement opens up Normal Raid finder, do that Heroic Raid finder etc. For M+ use your M+ Rating to determine which key level you can join a queue for
[2:48:22] notColt45: D: don't give me responsibility
[2:48:25] BlackCl0ud: everyone can raise their fishing skill
[2:48:25] TacDuc: Yup, like I mostly just play with people I know personally, but a few times I find some people I begin playing with someone I meet when doing a M+ with randoms
[2:48:25] JasperXtreme: so true, you get out of it what you want to put into it.
[2:48:29] SilkeySmooth: there is player gating in m+
[2:48:30] WayneG947: True. I Just can't bring myself to be social in MMOs because that 10-20 minutes chatting is time I could be putting into a dungeon run or rep grind
[2:48:30] MetalJoshP: Have to seek social aspects to find them in game they just aren’t as organic
[2:48:30] Buckwink: you can do M+ just push your own key and get good
[2:48:42] MetalJoshP: That’s very true
[2:48:49] SilkeySmooth: i dont have a phone i cant start a m+ group
[2:49:00] kaelibwow: Loool
[2:49:09] Heero_Effect: @wayneg947 lol no one talks in mythic plus
[2:49:10] Cabbageman007: Those changes that you tweet it out. Do you actually think they would possible to implement soon? #HopeSo
[2:49:11] Mitune: true which kinda is the m+ systems fault due to failure being so costly imo @SilkeySmooth Hopefully they will look at that
[2:49:30] Kisswani: I kinda hope they remove the timers on anything below M+10 , this way more people can try out the lower levels without the pressure of a timer
[2:49:31] BlackCl0ud: they should give fury warrs triple wielding 2handed weapons
[2:49:56] Velashen: @mitune very true it creates an elitist behavior by its very nature.
[2:50:03] SilkeySmooth: @Mitune id like the lower casual m+ like 1-5 to be a queue for casuals
[2:50:06] emznev: @Kisswani i agree that would be a good idea
[2:50:25] Alepouditsa: @Heero_Effect you know i was thinking, if we had voise chat insted of spelling ppl will be talking more then spelling
[2:50:40] SmallzzIV: can't wait for Hunters to dual wield range weapons

[2:50:53] Alepouditsa: @Heero_Effect i know there is on, i am talking about one that is allways on
[2:50:53] Kisswani: @SmallzzIV COPIUM
[2:50:58] Amarlian: mark of the wild...
[2:51:00] Mitune: @SilkeySmooth @velshan Exactly. The ff14 thing where you get extra rewards for new people might be a good addition as well
[2:51:05] Alepouditsa: one*
[2:51:14] kaelibwow: I don’t think m+ should have any timer, just base it off of deaths, with deaths on bosses meaning more
[2:51:16] SmallzzIV: @Kisswani ;)
[2:51:27] Heero_Effect: @alepouditsa maybe could be cool
[2:52:14] Frozen_DK: The new talent tree reminds me somewhat of the rift talent system :x
[2:52:19] CYNIC308: THIS is awesome! Blizz please steal more Path of Exile!
[2:52:50] temp3st98: ret reckoning LUL
[2:52:54] Amarlian: So a prot pally who can heal even more!
[2:52:56] temp3st98: oh wit
[2:52:56] Mitune: I would love if raids actually would ask for an alt tank such as ret prot for a mechanic
[2:52:57] WayneG947: Oh shit, that be nice
[2:52:57] MOLAR305: gimme ashen pls
[2:52:58] Amarlian: top those charts
[2:52:58] CYNIC308: Ret with Avenger Shield?
[2:52:58] temp3st98: wait
[2:53:01] Weegleman: with ashes Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:53:03] thunder993: prot holy pala hybrid in arena NotLikeThis
[2:53:04] TacDuc: I just want to top the healing boards even more as DK
[2:53:10] Alepouditsa: can we have beter aoe in a mage danBlank
[2:53:13] SpoofAvatar: PROT/RET
[2:53:13] Kisswani: A prto / ret hybrid would end up doing less damage than prot alone Kappa
[2:53:14] kaelibwow: Kick nor baseline is gonna be a mistake lmao
[2:53:16] SilkeySmooth: chain harvest for enhancement please
[2:53:23] CritcobainTV: wake of ashes, yeah
[2:53:24] mrsuflakis: or TD

[2:53:37] Paradox4g: Ashes of Creation Kappa
[2:53:46] SonofHorus82: yeah it's wake. it's my favorite button on my hotbar.
[2:53:49] MILESkg21: EAGLE 👁️
[2:53:50] SpoofAvatar: PROT/HOLY could outheal healer mains :P

[2:54:57] Gargantix: man, they really plan to have WoW going that long?!
[2:54:57] magemaster225: 2030 isnt that far away
[2:55:03] Thoreya: NOTHING stops this train
[2:55:06] magemaster225: thats like 2 xpacs
[2:55:06] lastdeo: 8 more years of world of warcraft?? ... I can take it :D
[2:55:13] Snabido: It's lived this long, dont be that suprised 😏
[2:55:16] MILESkg21: 8 years what KEKW
[2:55:23] kaelibwow: You will die before wow does, the grim reality
[2:55:29] Weegleman: feel like they'll do a stat crunch again vs lvl crunch.
[2:55:29] Kisswani: our grandkids are gonna go through another stat squish .....
[2:55:40] eziz86: i hate bliz not say date release
[2:55:53] Clicklesly: I mean, we get the biggest increase in power after we're already level capped still :-I
[2:56:05] swordart2022: True ION GIGACHAD
[2:56:16] mavericks312: we would be 110
[2:56:19] Mitune: This is literally one of the best interviews that has come out of Blizz in a long long time
[2:56:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Being 120 was fine with me
[2:56:32] Maytan26: WoW should do a engine update in  the next 4 years
[2:56:33] Tschetter21: I still think 90 is a pretty good spot to stop
[2:56:39] DeanoTV: 80 should be max
[2:56:44] DeanoTV: then squish to 60 again
[2:56:44] ANONlMAS: wow is forever?
[2:56:50] MOLAR305: i miss TD so much, it needs to be a 51 point talent for tanks
[2:56:52] WayneG947: keep the levels, reduce the damage numbers
[2:56:58] swordart2022: @maytan26 each expansion is engine update
[2:57:08] Deadcells: I can agree with that 80 max then squish back down to 60
[2:57:08] kaelibwow: TD made tanking fun
[2:57:15] Heero_Effect: @@@@
[2:57:17] Thoreya: solo que thank fucking god!!!!
[2:57:20] swordart2022: I hope for some engine,tech, settings interview, performance and such
[2:57:23] lithium364: finally i can solo farm vicious saddles
[2:57:23] TacDuc: Just because I had a lot of HP, and I could outheal my corruption damage didn't mean that I had higher damage than DPS, I had, but definitely wasn't the reason
[2:57:26] Nalleys: solo que rated arena PogChamp
[2:57:26] Kisswani: That was in Baj's interview with Holinka
[2:57:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rated SoloQ is something good, I think
[2:57:47] kaelibwow: Solo que arena or rbg?
[2:57:48] Thoreya: its so needed for pvp im so glad theyre doing it
[2:57:49] swordart2022: PvP is ResidentSleeper
[2:58:00] Thoreya: @kaelibwow arena
[2:58:02] kingkarellia: Do you still play lost ark?
[2:58:02] SilkeySmooth: rating for pve ilvl
[2:58:14] swordart2022: @thoreya watch how PvP population dips even more
[2:58:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, WoD-style scaling
[2:58:28] Thoreya: @fairplay2021 its ok to be wrong
[2:58:48] Thoreya: itll have its own mmr system
[2:58:51] reggiepowa: probably not same
[2:58:53] swordart2022: @thoreya I am right based on historical precedence
[2:58:54] SilkeySmooth: wod had some of the best pvp aside from mop
[2:58:54] mrsuflakis: different rating same rewards
[2:58:56] Thoreya: seperate from ranked 3v3
[2:59:01] MyRandomName: it's neat addition for pvp tho, good to see shuffle thing
[2:59:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: It they have a problem I think they could cap out SoloQ rating lower than regular arena
[2:59:06] reggiepowa: different rating and different rewards
[2:59:16] Thoreya: @fairplay2021 solo que was never in the game so historical precedence is irrelevant here
[2:59:24] MetalJoshP: They’d have to I’d imagine
[2:59:25] MyRandomName: still a bit disappointing no new BGs there's so much potential
[2:59:33] Longiboi: I dont see why not, rating is personal so solo rating doesnt change that
[2:59:40] swordart2022: @thoreya wod style gear.dont care for soloq
[2:59:45] ClickbaitGoesBrrr: yo man are you gonna be making any pettition to change how the new race looks :D
[2:59:55] lithium364: imagine they can Rewind your HP Pool % based
[3:00:07] EmpathyLiveChat: Chat, how long does levelling take in retail these days?
[3:00:08] swordart2022: @clickbaitgoesbrrr Ask for BOOBA
[3:00:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Healing with time sounds different
[3:00:21] rohdey: wax on wax off
[3:00:29] mrsuflakis: too op
[3:00:30] Thoreya: @EmpathyLiveChat like 9-20 hours depending how hard u go
[3:00:30] nilachip: alter time for healers
[3:00:37] Eregbueye: imagine a raid save like that
[3:00:37] swordart2022: @empathylivechat depends on you? towellie did fresh 1-50 in 18 something Hours
[3:00:38] faulen: alter time for healers
[3:00:42] Onearmyof2: so Alter time for tanks
[3:00:43] rohdey: minority report, the healer
[3:00:44] EmpathyLiveChat: @Thoreya Thanks Thoreya!
[3:00:56] lithium364: imagine they have PI and Bloodlust
[3:00:57] EmpathyLiveChat: @fairplay2021 Thank you!
[3:01:03] IianaDRK: time magic healing i love as an idea. im actually interested in trying evoker healer
[3:01:12] SilkeySmooth: the new class wil lbe op
[3:01:14] swordart2022: 1% issue KEKW
[3:01:17] MILESkg21: R Drood and Shammy deleted KEKW
[3:01:21] MetalJoshP: Or like tone bubble aoe revert time heal
[3:01:23] MetalJoshP: Time

[3:02:00] SilkeySmooth: 5 evoker healers for my raids...lol
[3:02:01] EmpathyLiveChat: I'm really excited that the game will be introducing its second hero class
[3:02:18] Merkuriuz: ad....
[3:02:21] kaelibwow: 15 evokers first raid WF lmfao
[3:02:36] swordart2022: True
[3:02:40] swordart2022: Exactly
[3:02:49] Thoreya: LUL
[3:02:51] BlackCl0ud: so true and real
[3:02:55] Eregbueye: @kaelibwow 18
[3:02:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, we want all specs fun and viable....that's good stuff
[3:02:56] ObsidianHealer: @EmpathyLiveChat DK and DH are hero classes, so 3rd hero class.
[3:03:16] PvtHudson093: Some are just viable than others
[3:03:27] Animejessica: Animejessica subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:03:28] PvtHudson093: more viable
[3:03:34] TacDuc: So a tank form
[3:03:39] OGXanos: No black dragon tank spec is suuuuch a miss
[3:03:40] MILESkg21: not yet Kappa
[3:03:43] notColt45: That woudl be dope
[3:03:44] ijuki: No tank Kappa
[3:03:44] abracka_: add the tank spec you cowards
[3:03:45] IianaDRK: im expecting black dragon magic to be more defensive earth stuff
[3:03:48] swordart2022: @fourteenfour are you deaf or what
[3:03:57] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: so maybe earth spikes being launched
[3:04:04] swordart2022: Gonna spec tank Kappa
[3:04:06] teenwolflife: There’s enough tanks
[3:04:09] EmpathyLiveChat: Oh sorry, third hero class
[3:04:18] teenwolflife: All classes added have had tanks we don’t need more tanks
[3:04:30] swordart2022: That sounds like fun mechanic to show skill
[3:04:34] BlackCl0ud: i actually want this type of spells for other classes
[3:04:36] XadanarGaming: black dragon tank spec and make the healer spec more of a green mage support debuffing enemys and buffing allies with haste/dr/cdr
[3:04:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: It'll be cool to see, I think
[3:04:46] Maytan26: it will feel bad on high latency
[3:04:59] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: hmmm did not see any of them holding weapons
[3:05:09] kurate: towelliee just made me watch 5 adds back to back. real professional.
[3:05:12] KodyTheTyger: Wildstar style of abilities, I like it
[3:05:31] Snabido: Fire mage's dragon breath says hello Kappa
[3:05:36] danimoto10: maybe 10.3.5
[3:05:38] nilachip: imagine a dragon rogue
[3:05:42] abracka_: @kurate blame twitch
[3:05:46] BlackCl0ud: fire mage summons a dragon head above him no?
[3:05:54] OGXanos: Hey we're gonna make a dragon class CREATED by Neltharion, but we're not gonna let them have a spec based on his flight. SMDH
[3:06:08] daega_music: the first class they release, Dracthyr Demon Hunters :p
[3:06:42] Neckro89: server identity doesn't exist anymore
[3:06:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Work orders help to make this work better
[3:06:45] BlackCl0ud: the good stuff RareParrot
[3:06:47] kaelibwow: Everything looks great for the expat, but damn that dragon race is gross
[3:06:49] Clicklesly: The whole profession system can backfire so much i feel...
[3:06:58] UlsterFarl: Thats something that actually matters to me.  I'd like to have professions be my main thing in 10.0 not PVP and PVE, outside of world PVE
[3:06:58] swordart2022: Well instead of recipies you lvl up quality
[3:07:04] tronbadgames: @Towelliee its gonna be like "im specialized in mail bracers, i have rank 10 of xyz"
[3:07:09] Kisswani: I doubt it'll be like that , I think it'll be random work order for the most part . except maybe for in guild stuff
[3:07:11] amricatt: I'm looking forward to work orders.
[3:07:12] chinfu303: @daega_music look i just want my demon hunter murloc
[3:07:15] JustAwaay: 0,1% world drop
[3:07:16] JackedDown: Recipes can be easy, what about materieals
[3:07:16] WayneG947: i remember being the master Tribal Leatherworker, i loved it
[3:07:19] daega_music: professions seem to fluxuate up & down with each expat
[3:07:29] notColt45: But my gloves are made with love!
[3:07:39] MetalJoshP: Probably part that part like mastering the crafting by some grind through crafting the specific item type I tgink
[3:07:41] stratiss: true
[3:07:46] swordart2022: Well that is like huge severs so there is bound to have many
[3:07:50] Two_Headed_Raven: sucks to be that guy that secializes in a tier slot xD
[3:07:53] NextLifeAfter: Free deviate fish with purchase
[3:07:54] Kisswani: but then the commisions will skyrocket in gold value
[3:07:54] slowfetch: problem with that is then it costs a bajillion gold
[3:08:10] Elindalyne: work orders will be the saving grace
[3:08:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I will make the best god damned pants on my server! My name will be known across the land!
[3:08:36] rymerre: ultimately crating is useless once the first raid tier comes out
[3:08:39] jmalmin: Got a feeling the quality is the thing which makes you the best crafter compared to the other crafters. That is the hard thing to max out.
[3:08:42] Kaymazing: In the new world it is so hard to max out a crafting profession, it needs loads of materials. Maybe that will be similar in DF
[3:09:01] swordart2022: Ye that is Pog
[3:09:16] BlackCl0ud: they should make as requirements reagents from older expansions, that would be sick
[3:09:17] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || THE BIRTH OF CHADBOMB!! - WoW 9 to 5 Episode 1 youtu.be/8qc5QklRzIo
[3:09:26] Poriand: why do i wanna be able to pre order so bad lol
[3:09:30] daega_music: i see how its a good idea, but idk how it will play out
[3:09:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: It can be really cool, I think
[3:09:37] slowfetch: just sounds like a pain in the ass.
[3:09:39] Kisswani: it feels like it's gonna be even harder in dragonflight to play on a low pop server tbh
[3:09:43] slowfetch: and gold sinks
[3:09:55] MetalJoshP: Imagine adding a dungeon role of like “smith or crafter” where they come to a dungeon only able to gather resources and you have to protect them as the rest of the group and if they never die you get a bonus loot item at end or something
[3:09:57] notColt45: I feel TSM will take over
[3:10:03] daega_music: did they announce server merges witht he expat?
[3:10:03] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:10:07] BlackCl0ud: inb4 workd order for weed KEKW
[3:10:07] mrniceguy817: Yea but what about larger reagent bags
[3:10:09] Mourningztar: I want to be a slave
[3:10:29] kaelibwow: ????
[3:10:31] Kisswani: @mrniceguy817 and more reagent bank slots
[3:10:36] MILESkg21: WHAT ??
[3:10:38] PotatoWin: Herb hey
[3:10:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Elite flower picking is neat
[3:10:45] swinkeh: you think we'll get crafting communities like we have boosting communities now

[3:10:55] daega_music: just give us a teepee!
[3:10:57] MILESkg21: never happening KEKW
[3:10:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Player housing LUL
[3:11:06] MetalJoshP: Order halls for professions
[3:11:08] Ahunamongus: and also, Pot is legal in NJ now...you can go back if you are inclined @Towelliee
[3:11:17] NextLifeAfter: loooove that farm
[3:11:18] kaelibwow: We have a garrison
[3:11:22] Arocian: I still go back to the old panda farm
[3:11:23] tebbix: Clueless surely
[3:11:25] darssia_: lowkey tired of hearing about playing housing.
[3:11:31] Rayzodoom: a point in time that will probably be too late
[3:11:38] YNR_Chewmiester: Runescape type housing lol
[3:11:39] MILESkg21: housing would make the cities empty
[3:11:42] fewyn: just like the dance studio
[3:11:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: It would add to the game to have cool player housing, but it's a huge undertaking to make it good
[3:11:47] yeti82: really, Why is housing so importen ?
[3:11:52] swordart2022: @mileskg21 nope
[3:11:55] BlackCl0ud: just give me a shack KEKW
[3:11:56] TeejayOCE: Idc about housing.. i like chilling in Org and SW
[3:11:59] slowfetch: ffxiv cities arent empty
[3:12:00] Impactus_Vult: That's all great but the real question they should have asked is: Dance studio when?
[3:12:01] Arocian: New World did a great job with housing
[3:12:02] swordart2022: 0 utility for house easy
[3:12:02] stratiss: new world housing is dope
[3:12:04] NextLifeAfter: put housing in the cities..
[3:12:04] littleofc1: just place the houses in the citys
[3:12:06] SilkeySmooth: yea
[3:12:12] WayneG947: Housing is a hub for your guild etc. it promotes interaction
[3:12:13] daega_music: what if they did guild apartment complexes?
[3:12:13] Kisswani: yeah but in FFXIV not everyone can have a house
[3:12:19] swordart2022: Put them in city 4Head
[3:12:20] kaelibwow: I just sit in houses in org
[3:12:21] YNR_Chewmiester: Think about Garrisons. people just hung out in them all day. Cities were empty
[3:12:23] UlsterFarl: SWTOR did a good job with housing, fleet still stays busy
[3:12:27] Bayne77: i just need somewhere to tell the kids to get off my lawn
[3:12:27] MistaHat: yes because in ff14 there totally isnt huge groups of people in cities
[3:12:28] 91Niki: @Impactus_Vult There already is a dance studio. They are in the AH on certain dates
[3:12:30] Kisswani: yeah
[3:12:30] jaykodiak: put them in the city, just like new world
[3:12:31] Nalleys: along as it doesn't end up with everyone sitting in them alone all day like garrisons
[3:12:33] Cafe0le: nah dont make it simple or dont bother
[3:12:42] ZerxsTV: let us have an apartment in normal cities outside of sw/org or other major cities, and then allow the houses to be purchased in Major Cities?
[3:12:43] swordart2022: That would be HUGE Pog
[3:12:47] rymerre: housing would have to be semi-instanced kinda like New World
[3:12:47] honkblarg: the head of a boss you have killed mounted up
[3:12:49] wreckshoptv: i miss wildstar housing ppl made like obsticle courses it was so awesome
[3:12:49] tebbix: POGGERS
[3:12:49] Rayzodoom: garrisons are not housing quit comparing them lol
[3:12:57] Pilha390: @Towelliee like the house in monster hunter iceborn?
[3:12:58] LegionOfFate: That would be freaking sick
[3:13:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they would need thousands of hours of work to make cool houses and furniture and get it working right
[3:13:01] Eregbueye: mythic terragrue
[3:13:05] 3663Sharad: There heads hanging on my wall KEKW
[3:13:06] Minemanjoker: Like a Myspace top 10 list?
[3:13:11] Gotxiko: so basically what we thought garrisons would be, but fell short
[3:13:13] UlsterFarl: Only trophy I would wan't is Hogger
[3:13:15] wreckshoptv: like in valheim
[3:13:16] swordart2022: That would be Pog
[3:13:16] daega_music: hire someone from the Sims team to help out
[3:13:17] Rayzodoom: guild housing I think would be better than player though
[3:13:19] JasperXtreme: EQ2 had a great housing system, love to see something like that.
[3:13:34] Weegleman: archeology display cases would be neat.
[3:13:35] cranjismcbasketball069: I'd love to show off my Tusks of Mannoroth
[3:13:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: if they keep to this no borrowed power system i could see them having the time to design a housing system for 11.0. right now they need to focus on talent revamp
[3:13:41] Impactus_Vult: @91Niki Well that's more like a disco or a club. Way back when they teased a "dnce studio" where you could learn dances from other races. But that became a meme real quick ;)
[3:13:41] Sayryn: Mortgaged Power
[3:13:42] DerekChats: wildstar had a great housing system.
[3:13:48] Ebo1337_PBP: @Towelliee Would be cool to get anniversary rewards that mimic what the employees get and statues from store for in your home for kills
[3:13:54] yeti82: you have garrison and class hall :P Zzzzzz
[3:13:57] wreckshoptv: yeah miss wildstar houing
[3:13:58] Rayzodoom: wildstars system was nuts
[3:14:02] Kisswani: to me it's all about the trophies
[3:14:09] abracka_: rift had pretty amazing housing as well, could build a house from the ground up
[3:14:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, just moving a couch around could be tough to do
[3:14:21] yeti82: play sims then :P
[3:14:26] swordart2022: Well we will have flying physics so
[3:14:26] JasperXtreme: I'd be happy with just a guild hall if it's easier.
[3:14:27] pronkk_: pronkk11 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! huh?
[3:14:28] KodyTheTyger: I’ll always have a soft spot for wildstars housing
[3:14:31] Nalleys: well if they don't have the texh
[3:14:31] swordart2022: All is possible
[3:14:32] bowsers1: player housing will not happen with current wow engine
[3:14:40] MetalJoshP: Player housing 13.0
[3:14:48] ObsidianHealer: I understand people want it and I'm all for it. I just hope its a side thing and not required to use cause I dont like player housing.
[3:14:53] Kisswani: KEKW Garrisons and Fan-favorite in the same question
[3:14:59] wreckshoptv: lol what
[3:15:01] lovemymage: lol
[3:15:02] danimoto10: lol
[3:15:03] DeanoTV: eww KEKW
[3:15:04] theSalute: I liked the gold they made
[3:15:04] fewyn: i liked garrisons
[3:15:05] IccyCold: 100% it's possible. Private servers have similar features where you can build / spawn in rooms, walls, doors. Make it instances & its easy.
[3:15:06] honkblarg: i loved my garrison
[3:15:13] UlsterFarl: i still miss my garrison
[3:15:14] JasperXtreme: was anything in WoD a fan favorite?
[3:15:15] theSalute: LOL
[3:15:17] PvtHudson093: When we were making millions of gold it was making
[3:15:18] ArcaneSyntax: I loved the gold form the garrison
[3:15:19] Snabido: I'd like to call them Goldrrisons
[3:15:21] mavericks312: garrisons were trash lol
[3:15:21] Eregbueye: Garrksl
[3:15:24] theSalute: I played a lot of wod tbh !
[3:15:26] Frumples_TV: What? garrisons make the game feel dead
[3:15:27] TheStarhammer: I loved my garrison
[3:15:40] luckfore: @Snabido haHAA
[3:15:40] Rankle19: I still go to my garrison all the time I still got my hearth to my garrison lol
[3:15:41] MetalJoshP: I played WOD for pvp only
[3:15:43] cranjismcbasketball069: WoD is good now didn't you hear?
[3:15:46] abracka_: @FRUMPLES_ i think the lack of content did that
[3:15:46] danimoto10: UI is not really a feature common
[3:15:49] Snabido: @luckfore haHAA
[3:15:51] Aidler: If they couldn’t do player housing with “10.0” I have no hope they will ever do it. I mean “10.0”…. that should really be a monumental expansion. not a normal expansion
[3:15:56] TacDuc: The current engine probably can't, but I'm sure they can update the engine, as they always seems to be able to do almost anything with the engine
[3:16:00] essadis: morning @Towelliee .  I'm pretty excited to come back to WoW
[3:16:05] fewyn: Was WoD or Shadowlands better?
[3:16:19] daega_music: i love shadowlands tbh
[3:16:25] DeanoTV: SL was better, it had content
[3:16:28] MetalJoshP: WOD > now
[3:16:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dragon races
[3:16:32] daega_music: not my fav expat, but not the worst
[3:16:32] luckfore: i hate shadowlands tbh
[3:16:37] CYNIC308: customizable mounts is POG
[3:16:40] bowsers1: Pog
[3:16:42] CardinalTX: Garrison was fine as optional content
[3:16:43] Kisswani: POGGERS
[3:16:46] justincb29: i really dont like leveling in shadowlands the zones are such a drag
[3:16:47] DeanoTV: SL isnt great but still better than wod
[3:16:52] WayneG947: MoP POG
[3:16:55] hasan666: 2022?
[3:17:04] MetalJoshP: WOD just had no content
[3:17:04] metallicv12: i wanna get back into retail cause of dragonflight and i logged in and instantly logged out KEKW
[3:17:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: One guy said it best, this UI update is way overdue and good, but many people use addons anyway
[3:17:36] justincb29: when is dragonflight gonna release?
[3:17:40] FrankTizzle: NEVER
[3:17:44] hasan666: wut
[3:17:46] swordart2022: Yuck
[3:18:02] DeanoTV: M0 would be fine for que
[3:18:09] mavericks312: ion knows first that would be super toxic if M+ had lfg lol
[3:18:10] DeanoTV: not +
[3:18:16] swordart2022: TRUE
[3:18:18] darssia_: what's wrong with the way it works now lul?
[3:18:21] Aidler: that’s why I don’t do M+
[3:18:21] OssaLive: mythic + solo qin like solo shuffle (but tied to IO maybe?) would be cool i think
[3:18:23] daega_music: i just really hate how they make us focus on shit then get rid of it, like in legion with weapon mastery & in SL with the covenant. all this grind will prob be for nothing
[3:18:27] thunder993: m+ que would be a shit show
[3:18:29] TeejayOCE: no way + should be premade lol
[3:18:37] Velashen: Eh this is a game of hand holding. Just telling people to suddenly become social for M+ is what keeps it gated off.
[3:18:44] OssaLive: impossible to ever get into grps for dps
[3:18:47] DeanoTV: @daega_music didn't u hear DF has no new system like that
[3:18:49] Thoreya: maybe for keys like under 10 that would be alright
[3:18:49] TeejayOCE: i said that wrong.. no way it should be automade ? lol
[3:18:59] swordart2022: @daega_music ye dude imagine replacing your gear
[3:19:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Want to make it better? Stop having keys deplete
[3:19:09] darssia_: yeah right who's asking for a m+ que finder?
[3:19:10] ObsidianHealer: Yeah itd be bad
[3:19:11] FrankTizzle: trying to do a +20 key via dungeon queue OMEGALUL
[3:19:13] TacDuc: Shitshow, randoms are terrible 90% of the time
[3:19:23] mavericks312: imagine a group with no meta comp ppl would leave immediatley
[3:19:25] XshadowturkeyX: but what about mythic 0 so people can easily get their own key?
[3:19:25] bowsers1: Casuals
[3:19:26] swordart2022: Some weirdos
[3:19:28] ImCancakes: thats when you end up having no lust in your group
[3:19:28] Kisswani: Masochists Kappa
[3:19:30] hasan666: DPSes LUL
[3:19:33] temp3st98: casual? LUL
[3:19:33] ArcaneSyntax: any ASKERS
[3:19:34] tebbix: Also would be more toxicity lol
[3:19:39] bowsers1: casuals who hate score i.o
[3:19:39] Lungle: Mythic + shouldn't be LFG, but maybe Mythic 0 should be?
[3:19:40] DeanoTV: @XshadowturkeyX u can get a key in oribos from npc

[4:09:20] DuploThief: bitch
[4:09:27] jerexify: @Towelliee Question for you. Do you do all the campaigns (read: the unnecessary ones now, like Korthia) on your alts? Or just stuff that is current?

[4:09:48] illi333: most likely 2023 release??
[4:09:51] ErkTheMighty: do you think the profession changes are going to have much of an impact on gold in general?

[4:10:38] Alllprimer: @Mr__AV it resets
[4:10:43] DuploThief: unity belt
[4:10:49] Coriollis: dont u get your leggo first ?

[4:10:59] Hitokiri83: stockpile anima to buy the gear in ZM right off the bat
[4:11:00] Hyelander_: ZM you can buy 233 with 500 anima
[4:11:05] Kinghorn: 9 to 5er would do some low keys
[4:11:05] EuphoricH4mster: is it worth doing lfr on an alt just for the tier gear?
[4:11:08] Ortinoth: @123boom 9 to 5 challenge
[4:11:14] icetoce: do u have video how to make UI like urs
[4:11:21] Mugizora: @EuphoricH4mster 100%
[4:11:31] tronbadgames: is the move to just buy 291 lego base and craft that first?
[4:11:35] xmrav_: @Mr__AV @Alllprimer that's what i thought. TY.
[4:11:37] Nico_vdM: Yes, it is 226
[4:11:39] Ariea_Whisper: can buy the 233 gear off ah for cheap too
[4:11:40] lumaday: the ZM questline gives a bunch of 233
[4:11:41] Volkien: I hate the current survival spec, I prefer Classic survival hunter spec
[4:11:46] Alllprimer: towHAMUP
[4:11:47] Hyelander_: sorry yea it was 226
[4:11:49] xmrav_: ZM flying should be account wide. this is BS.
[4:12:02] RamboOstrich: 18hrs of just questing or other stuff too?
[4:12:09] Hyelander_: Youre never under powered as a hunter =D
[4:12:09] DuploThief: @Mr__AV it is
[4:12:12] MrGharr: you can also get 246 accessories by opening the sand pile treasures
[4:12:14] Nico_vdM: On my main I have 200k anima so I just gave all the low geared alts full 226 sets
[4:12:27] raye_gaming22: ZM mobs are scaled so you wont get one shoted
[4:12:34] SpoofAvatar: can buy green 226 BOEs for like a few hundred gold each
[4:12:34] icetoce: @Mr__AV if its first char on acc i think u need to finish everything but i have it on my alts
[4:12:34] Bowwjack: @Towelliee can you get carried in the 9 to 5 challenge?
[4:12:45] Nico_vdM: !9to5
[4:12:45] Moobot: @Nico_vdM The 9 to 5 WoW Challenge has begun! || ✅ AVG 2.5 Hours per day every week (Long as I hit 17.5HRS per week)✅ Survival Hunter (YEAR OF THE SPEAR!)✅ BRAND NEW WoW Account✅ No handouts at all! || How hard can it really be? || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj5WI5NEHkY
[4:12:45] KainhNZ: @Helyiolasz not until after chapter 6 of the ZM campaign, though :\
[4:12:49] xmrav_: @Mr__AV @DuploThief really? i thought he said he would grind the flying. that's great then
[4:12:56] Kinghorn: carried by who? the 9 to 5er has no friends Bowjack31
[4:13:00] Nico_vdM: "No handouts at all" my guess is no :p
[4:13:04] Coriollis: dow I do it : ilvl leggo form AH and Thorgast/ ZM - > get flying/finish campaign in greens/233 gear frm q / go open boxes kill bosses get sandworn relic / catalyst them
[4:13:09] CYNIC308: remember when Preach did this on a warlock and he was getting mythic raid invites in less than 2 weeks
[4:13:10] Coriollis: *how I do it
[4:13:14] Nachozdood: kinda wish my classic mounts would link to my shadowlands collection only stuff i dont have from TBC and Classic would be tiger and OG war bear
[4:13:14] TacDuc: That would be pretty unrealistic to get carried as a 9-5
[4:13:19] MiddlePhaze: whats the point of this 9 to 5 again?
[4:13:47] Ortinoth: time
[4:13:49] Nico_vdM: AotC or KSM?
[4:13:52] EarlofCockwood: MiddlePhaze: whats the point of this 9 to 5 again?
[4:13:54] Kinghorn: aotc would be insane
[4:14:00] CozyScaper: KSM instead?
[4:14:03] Maroleb: if only Jailer had an essence token
[4:14:07] Buckwink: the drops are dogshit
[4:14:10] theDirtyon3: actually true
[4:14:12] Eregbueye: Some people do
[4:14:12] icetoce: Do you have video for your UI ?
[4:14:13] nikodets: i can invite you into my guild group for jailer
[4:14:22] Endin: I'm sure more jailer nerfs are coming
[4:14:26] jerexify: It's too bad you aren't Alliance, then. Our raid team is specifically an AOTC team, so we will be doing Heroic Jailer.
[4:14:27] Nico_vdM: More chances to complete KSM than AotC
[4:14:33] Eziak: KSM is so easy this patch.
[4:14:35] Ortinoth: professions or gathering
[4:14:38] purrfecto: tough getting in 15s without 4 piece
[4:14:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep legendaries are going to suck
[4:14:39] rbolude: people who only do H progress and dont go in mythic probably do it
[4:14:40] Kinghorn: herb picking stream POGGERS
[4:14:44] MrGharr: legos are cheap now
[4:14:46] Eziak: I think portals is a better goal
[4:14:51] wreckshoptv: yo im lvling on tbc in eastern plaguelands and theres a scarlet mob called scarlet invoker :O
[4:14:53] raye_gaming22: herbs selling quite good on eu
[4:14:54] VARlATlON: skinning and vendor shuffle with the bow @Towelliee
[4:14:55] Ammbrus: Legendaries are so bad this xpac. Usually i make money leveling/gearing alts. Now I lose shit tons
[4:15:01] TeejayOCE: low level legendary is cheap
[4:15:04] azukh1: just do all the callings
[4:15:11] CYNIC308: naw unity belt and freebie from 1300 sould ash
[4:15:12] JFeezy__: i have level 8 renown on my main. Blah, returning player and gotta do that grind. Big yikes.
[4:15:14] Endin: time to buy that wow token
[4:15:15] ContraRob: I mean a new player could buy a token
[4:15:18] Eziak: They just buy tokens.
[4:15:18] Snabido: Duo gathering? Might be faster than creating, say, plates and alchemy for newbies
[4:15:20] azukh1: tonnes of passive gold from callings
[4:15:23] Coriollis: leggos are 60-70 k now idk like a new player would not know to juggle the ah :)
[4:15:24] theDirtyon3: grind some gold farms
[4:15:29] breadwilton: no tokens! haha
[4:15:34] TacDuc: Even as a returning player I refuse to use more money than needed
[4:15:37] breadwilton: gonna be fun watching that XD
[4:15:39] VARlATlON: skinning and vendor shuffle with the bow @Towelliee towPog
[4:15:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: i still have 1.4 million on retail think i bought a token once in draenor
[4:15:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can go with a cheaper legendary like a cloak, maybe, but still it's like 50K gold or whatever
[4:15:59] calvinpewpewpew: How long does the level grind take nowadays? Most of my old guild moved servers, and while I want to play with them, I am not sure I want to pay the server transfer fee and level up. Conversely, I have way less time than I used to so a 1-60 level grind seems steep.
[4:16:02] Janigiv: @Towelliee arent viewers gonna give u all the gear?
[4:16:08] theDirtyon3: LUL
[4:16:13] TeejayOCE: ive never bought a token :)
[4:16:15] Signa_arize: hello!
[4:16:19] Heero_Effect: Token haha
[4:16:20] jmalmin: I only buy tokens with in game gold myself. never spent money on a token.
[4:16:20] jaacobjames: for me its like would i rather spend the time in game to farm gold or would i rather work for 30 mins irl and get a token lol
[4:16:22] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: @Towelliee wowhead put up a new item about Leveling and Chromie Time Changes
[4:16:31] happybooger: @Towelliee just buy a run from BDGG
[4:16:33] TacDuc: Only times I've spent money on token is gold from in-game R.I.P. old AH
[4:16:48] PatchMyEye: @jmalmin but you gotta get gold first then
[4:16:49] CYNIC308: @calvinpewpewpew 1-50 is 18 hours
[4:17:11] Coriollis: yeah sloot had one yestrday
[4:17:15] happybooger: @Towelliee yes they do
[4:17:15] icetoce: @cynic308 its faster than that
[4:17:19] Shadowlemur01: Yeah, they do it is listed in their discord
[4:17:21] raye_gaming22: i sure they sell sylvanas mount cuz we do on EU
[4:17:21] Utmost777: his title the other day said sale runs
[4:17:23] CYNIC308: you get a free lego first time for 1300 soul ash and Unity belt
[4:17:27] CritcobainTV: They sell mythic sylvanas for sure, I just put in an order for sylvanas dagger stack @Towelliee
[4:17:37] Janigiv: maw intro still not skipable @Towelliee ?
[4:17:38] calvinpewpewpew: @cynic308 Thanks! How about 50-60? I think I have a few 50s I could transfer. $30 is worth it to save 18 hours of game time TBH!
[4:17:55] CYNIC308: @icetoce Towelliee just showed his played time so yea you can do it faster but 18 hours is reasonable
[4:18:01] Hitokiri83: @Janigiv new account hes on cant skip
[4:18:08] Heero_Effect: Buying runs fuels the problem. But if streamers do it I guess it’s fine. I only do what they do and play what they play Kappa
[4:18:10] Janigiv: oooh
[4:18:13] CYNIC308: @calvinpewpewpew idk how fast can you clear shadowlands
[4:18:24] Nachozdood: @Towelliee why not take Trailblazer talent to speed this up?
[4:18:30] icetoce: @cynic308 just for alts best for me is WOD, que for dng and do quests
[4:18:31] theDirtyon3: buying runs has been in the game since vanilla
[4:18:38] theDirtyon3: towStop towIt
[4:18:42] Relic7: Problem Pepega
[4:18:44] JamboKong: facts
[4:18:49] DannyG757: @Critcobain do you have to go through their discord or something to request that?
[4:18:58] Gravity16: I find levelling is the most fun part of wow, hitting end level I just wanna level again lol
[4:19:00] duffluv22: Hes pretending to be a brand new WoW player.
[4:19:07] Utmost777: @theDirtyon3 but the token hasn't
[4:19:15] Nazz_1138: AMEN @Towelliee
[4:19:26] Fangy_Playz: The amount of people who used to sell Molten Core Attunements
[4:19:27] theDirtyon3: @UtmostOwnage plz tell me what the fucking difference is though
[4:19:29] calvinpewpewpew: whats Towelliee's current playtime on this alt?
[4:19:33] theDirtyon3: exactly
[4:19:35] CYNIC308: @icetoce ok but i think you are actually answering @calvinpewpewpew  im just trying to be helpful in chat
[4:19:40] CritcobainTV: @Critcobain Yeah i posted in their disc, no reply yet
[4:19:40] abracka_: susan express i haven't heard that name in like 15 years
[4:19:42] Nazz_1138: dgamesky....
[4:19:49] Troniin: @towelliee is the plater profile that you are using listed anywhere?
[4:19:57] Towelliee: !plater
[4:19:58] Moobot: @Towelliee Towelliee's Plater Addon Profile - https://wago.io/1ZozQnKxj
[4:19:58] Ammbrus: inflation is just super bad rn..you take a few months break from the game and now you're expected to pay 100k for a legendary on an alt LUL
[4:20:03] Janigiv: do u know what happens with bolvar when shadowlands ends @Towelliee ? i doubt he will be in dragonflight
[4:20:06] Nazz_1138: SUPER SKETCH Gold seller
[4:20:06] Utmost777: @Towelliee true
[4:20:07] bigdaddystunna: susan express... core memory unlocked lmao
[4:20:08] lastdeo: I can confirm... I mean... I don't know abot that :p
[4:20:09] JamboKong: I dont see a problem using in game currency for doing things in game
[4:20:09] CYNIC308: there would be small countries being funded off of black market WoW gold! LUL
[4:20:11] hasan666: g2g
[4:20:11] Kinghorn: I bought gold back in the day, told my friends I got an epic to drop I sold LUL
[4:20:14] Ortinoth: i still haven't bought a token to date using IRL money - all have been supported by in game means
[4:20:15] b_nannerz: Look at classic wow for example about gold selling.
[4:20:17] MILESkg21: SUSAN EXPRESS KEKW
[4:20:17] theDirtyon3: @Ammbrus leggos are like 30k now
[4:20:18] CardinalTX: Chat spam was the real annoyance to be honest. Just left the channel
[4:20:30] Ammbrus: theDirtyon3 you're aware you're 99% not on my server LUL
[4:20:38] Ortinoth: it really is easy to make gold now
[4:20:39] lumaday: maybe a mod was updated
[4:20:46] theDirtyon3: @Ammbrus your server just sucks then LUL

[4:47:53] Fangy_Playz: I'm interested in the new talent system
[4:47:58] Hungry_Sultan: yea i feel we needed to get back to  the mother lands its been a long time
[4:47:58] Raxus: simplicity?
[4:48:02] Ryathael: So far, the only thing Im not a fan of, is our flying mounts being relegated to ground only. wish they could add out mounts into the Dragon Flying thing. =\
[4:48:02] Krait06: i want more cinematics
[4:48:02] Smeaghoul: New race/class as well

[4:48:52] lastdeo: the new system is the old system
[4:48:53] unholyorc: @Towelliee leveling through dungeons and only being able to spam NW until like level 56 shows you the players who wipe none stop on the 3rd boss, its harder than +15s
[4:48:53] Raxus: Bellular will ALWAYS complain.  thats his thing lol
[4:48:54] Hungry_Sultan: its just revamps and fixing which is what people asked for
[4:48:58] LeoMako: the systems are talents and tier sets

[4:49:02] reinhardtdog: I hope that's what we players wanted.... no borrowed power at all.  its been so long that we have had it.
[4:49:02] tomcruise210: all the negative stuff has been the FF fanboys thinking wow stole the "sundering" lore lol and how they stole from FF
[4:49:03] tronbadgames: @Towelliee ive heard the tryhard community complaining about stuff like that, "where's the raids, where's the systems" etc.

[4:57:06] Skkold: FF players are salty
[4:57:08] grumpnamedjosh: They did say its the biggest continent they have released so far so I would hope there is lots of side stories and quest lines.

[4:58:09] Sollice: Anyone on Stormrage a blacksmith?
[4:58:18] Sollice: @fairplay2021 Yeah and there is only one on the AH for 49l
[4:58:19] tebbix: @VicAva12 He does, but still shits on WoW even tho he is not planning to play
[4:58:21] Sollice: 49k
[4:58:27] TacDuc: @TacDuc That's way too many race changes, because of course I want every character to be a duck, hence the name of all my characters
[4:58:35] CYNIC308: LUL Pyro was a Sylvanas apologist who got burned for being on the wrong side of the storyline and then "lost his shit" live when he realized he was the biggest dupe in the WoW community! LUL
[4:58:39] Sielu11628: Zones are looking massive. Dragon races, so much good info in these interviews!
[4:58:46] PvtHudson093: when they untangle all the spegetti code
[4:58:52] UnknownLegendDPS: "quitting wow" KEKW
[4:59:05] MILESkg21: nobody QUITS WOW KEKW
[4:59:10] chiefiskeith: we can I'll afford another klendathu
[4:59:12] aumixp: People will allways moan and bitch about things whatever blizzard is doing
[4:59:13] lithium364: he had the same meltdown during the 10.0 cinematic
[4:59:13] hasan666: imagine hating a game. just enjoy whatever you like man
[4:59:15] KainhNZ: can you imagine being one of the NPC covenant souls during this expack? some have been working centuries trying to ascend to the next level, and you come in and turn the whole shadowlands upside down within like a year LUL
[4:59:16] Hawke_89: Do you blame him?
[4:59:16] TompsonX: ANTS IN BOBBY KOTTICKS MAZE
[4:59:19] tebbix: KEKW True
[4:59:23] taobender777: It looks pretty good… but we don’t the details yet… plays those dragon forms look goofy as hell
[4:59:23] IianaDRK: nobody quits wow, u just take extended breaks
[4:59:28] gelimarr: HOLY SMOKES you are level 51 already
[4:59:30] EvilStreak: their lives must be that easy if a video game is their main worry
[4:59:34] xFevers: guy who doesnt play wow anymore says new wow expac will be bad ... more at 11
[4:59:39] Jokervenom1978: Pyromancer had personal issues.
[4:59:41] Elindalyne: pyro is just farming the ff community now
[4:59:46] septinuz: people have meltdown over work tho.. if its your work fair inuf
[4:59:56] JamboKong: that ain't bad
[4:59:56] gelimarr: 20h = 50 levels, good to know
[5:00:00] xaeblue: I've watched one single stream of Pyro and it was the dragonflight cinematic reaction, followed by FF gameplay. He seemed really pretentious throughout
[5:00:03] CardinalTX: meltsdown and then spends 1000's of dollars in LA     lolz
[5:00:15] Coriollis: sometimes with irl stuff over things u can have a meltdown
[5:00:15] LeoMako: Half the people flaming wow are ff players that never played it.
[5:00:16] legionph2: @Elindalyne sooo trueee
[5:00:22] taobender777: It’s like they tried to take the toxic masculinity out of dragon form and made them look like sleestacks
[5:00:22] gelimarr: who
[5:00:26] JukasZor: oh boy we get to go find Arbutter Pelagross
[5:00:27] cyb3rduck365: who?

[5:00:30] MILESkg21: TRUE KEKW
[5:00:32] septinuz: true
[5:00:44] hasan666: that's dumb
[5:00:45] gelimarr: who we talking about
[5:00:47] JamboKong: facts don't care about their feelings
[5:00:50] xxsargexx: now hes mooching off FF
[5:00:53] Zomgboy: KEK
[5:00:53] mayhemguy: who
[5:00:54] cyb3rduck365: rich?
[5:00:56] BoezIRL: who we talking about?
[5:00:56] UmmNoU: so many hypocrits during the great WoW exodus. Shameless mf's
[5:00:56] yaji42069: gamer gotta eat yo
[5:00:58] havenbirch: Pyromancer will return when he realizes Dragonflight will be the best expac ever
[5:01:07] TompsonX: Not Rich, Pyro
[5:01:09] Elindalyne: @xaeblue you mean someone that literally rips apart their wow knick nacks and eats lore books isn't putting on an act?
[5:01:09] MeisterPetze: rich is a 100% idiot
[5:01:15] hasan666: Best expac Kappa
[5:01:16] BeardedKuhn: basically pulled a Preach
[5:01:18] swordart2022: Same GIGACHAD
[5:01:18] gelimarr: Don't know Pyro
[5:01:23] tebbix: I have played the whole MSQ, collected lots of glamour and mounts and I still liked the WoW announcement and I can't wait to play the new expansion, why you have to shit on the game
[5:01:29] MILESkg21: RICH'S meltdown was epic 4Head
[5:01:30] aikopooh: who we talking about
[5:01:31] SensationalBanana: The problem is that they never move on from WoW. Baaad case of ex-partner syndrome, they have. Can't move on, can't handle others having fun with their ex.
[5:01:33] chaotikz7: FF and LA, now he loves that Vampire one lol
[5:01:34] Skkold: When he's on his personal account he is always playing WoW though.
[5:01:35] TacDuc: And then they can stop making other players miserable, which is also very good
[5:01:36] aikopooh: just came from afk
[5:01:36] B0V3N: asmonBoy asmonBoy
[5:01:36] Todmeister9000: almost happy Sadge
[5:01:36] septinuz: ye its personal aswel i guess with him combo
[5:01:36] KainhNZ: almost  LUL
[5:01:38] TompsonX: ANTS IN BOBBY KOTTICKS MAZE
[5:01:38] invisiblematter: asmon is back in wow now tho
[5:01:39] JamboKong: asmongold gave towlie praise yesterday
[5:01:40] hasan666: almost happy LOL
[5:01:42] Nathanonfire: he bitches because thats  his gimmick on his channel....
[5:01:44] CYNIC308: Rich Campbell has always been a shitbird and probably smells like used car salesman cheese
[5:01:44] xaeblue: @Elindalyne Oh I have no clue, I've known of him for like a week even though I've played WoW for 15+ years lol
[5:01:47] Exxcar: Heya @Towelliee and all! towHAMUP
[5:01:48] xFevers: Now he doesnt even play FF anymore
[5:01:52] tricky_86: tricky_86 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:01:54] xxsargexx: what i meant to say is that Pyro is FF's problem now LUL
[5:01:54] Hitokiri83: pyro had to use his tinfoil hat to make some pizza polls and he was scared
[5:01:56] SilkeySmooth: preach wants meaningful talent choices....lol
[5:01:57] XshadowturkeyX: did you hear that asmon said that he her gets in the state where he nneds to take a break from streaming hes jsut gonna quit
[5:02:02] TeejayOCE: I mean i'd be happy if FF kids were handing me money like that too LULW
[5:02:02] responsiv: ya another terrible xpac was announced why not bandwagon
[5:02:02] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[5:02:03] Snabido: Implying he ever left 😏
[5:02:04] tronbadgames: @Towelliee asmon seems like he went from wow fan who streamed, to streamer.. it comes off a lot more business minded
[5:02:05] gelimarr: You are my fav streamer
[5:02:06] xaeblue: @Elindalyne He just game off like he was above the WoW community, it was weird
[5:02:15] schneid4: everyone needs time away to recharge
[5:02:15] CardinalTX: Not gonna lie....i enjoyed wow more when i didnt watch asmons stream    hehe
[5:02:19] Coriollis: asmon will be forever a wow fanboy but if he also needs to say smthng about the quality of things he also says it :)
[5:02:23] Krimsonz23: Curious, what’s your thoughts on bringing back a talent system?
[5:02:24] cabalish: i am so fucking ready for alpha beta
[5:02:30] Molvonos: Peligone
[5:02:35] SensationalBanana: Towelliee and Taliesin = the only streamers I watch these days. Don't like flip-floppers.
[5:02:54] MistaHat: i think i missed something who was calling peeps shills? were we talking about asmon? or someone else
[5:02:58] gelimarr: I only watch Towelliee, don't have time for others
[5:03:03] taobender777: I have tried every xpac… and probably always will, but when the shit sucks… I like people who say it
[5:03:05] xxsargexx: @SixFourBoom to be fair hes playing a persona, on his zack channel hes far more chill and better to watch
[5:03:08] TacDuc: Nippleman 2.0
[5:03:11] Molvonos: He's gonna be our new Spirit Guide when we die in Dragon Isles. We'll see him everywhere.
[5:03:13] finnstigatrr: @Towelliee always appreciate your down-to-earth takes on WoW. I enjoy watching you because of that positivity. Good stuff man.
[5:03:14] Two_Headed_Raven: TYRANDAH!
[5:03:15] mavericks312: we gotta go rescue sylvanas eventually
[5:03:16] havenbirch: What's with the people telling others not to pre-purchase Dragonflight? I wanna pre-purchase it personally
[5:03:20] Jokervenom1978: Kleia shouldve been Arbiter. Pelagos was the most inept kyian.
[5:03:22] MeisterPetze: syl still doing her dailys
[5:03:23] Kisswani: Illidain will probably kill him , he looks Chandelerish Kappa
[5:03:29] Alepouditsa: @SensationalBanana i only wach Towelliee i don't know i can't stand the others
[5:03:30] tronbadgames: time is fast in the maw, they could come back to her and be like "all done"
[5:03:40] dracullus: Pelagos will appear and say: DON'T TOUCH YOURSELF I'M WATCHING
[5:03:41] Molvonos: Nanthanos gets reincarnated as a kyrian swolkin.
[5:03:41] Bayne77: i think i just stepped on Nathanos in Torghast
[5:03:44] CardinalTX: @xxsargexx 100% you are right
[5:03:44] gelimarr: Pelagos found
[5:03:52] invisiblematter: the titan watcher story arc looks like a winner
[5:03:53] TacDuc: I think I got a dagger of him for my rogue
[5:03:54] SonofHorus82: I dont. Nathanos was a twat.
[5:03:57] xxsargexx: nah sylv should stay there for 1-2 expansions
[5:04:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: sylvannis gonna be walking around the maw in a orange safety vest picking up lost souls with a claw
[5:04:02] vic_ave: @Towelliee what happened to Malfurion?
[5:04:03] warrenny: Does anyone care? He was great but not needed it shadowlands what we got was good
[5:04:04] Atem___: Sylvanas and Anduin hanging in the maw rescuing souls, Genn gonna be pissed
[5:04:04] bumpstock75: He was annoying , im glad he;s gone
[5:04:11] TheUnknowing: well they couldnt let danuser keep using nathanos as a self insert to be with his qween so
[5:04:17] jmalmin: He did have a camo when Tyranade and Sylvanas did fight. and might be one of the reasons why Sylvanas actually turned on the jailer.
[5:04:19] swordart2022: Pelagos got some balls later
[5:04:21] taobender777: We should be able to see Sylvanas hunting in the maw now when we are there… would have been cool
[5:04:27] EmperorSheol: true
[5:04:27] Molvonos: Yea, he had actual character growth
[5:04:29] swordart2022: Yee with Kleia
[5:04:34] MeisterPetze: bolvar :D
[5:04:36] Khade_Tyrson: @towelliee , they pulled a Garrosh on Nathanos.
[5:04:36] Kisswani: Kleia as well
[5:04:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Drakka, too, but yeah
[5:04:42] KainhNZ: wasn't Pelagos stuck like that for hundreds of years according to the in-game story?
[5:04:46] havenbirch: What's with the people telling others not to pre-purchase Dragonflight?
[5:04:47] swordart2022: True
[5:04:48] gelimarr: You almost jumped in
[5:04:49] EmperorSheol: he hops right on that damn mount into mortis
[5:04:50] ArcaneSyntax: Pelagos is the only character to fully explore each zone.
[5:04:55] Myndjestyr: tbh i found pelagos kind of boring and forced, but to each his own
[5:04:58] Beardstain: just got here, hello
[5:05:01] Kisswani: Theotar was cool , for a bit
[5:05:02] TacDuc: Uther would be perfect aswell, he saw his wrongs in throwing Arthas into the maw
[5:05:08] TompsonX: I don't think the world building was the problem with the story. it was the main story line itself
[5:05:12] taobender777: Pelagos was a puss
[5:05:15] Fangy_Playz: @Towelliee All i wanna know is tortollan allied race when? I want to swim and say A TURTLE MADE IT TO THE WATER.
[5:05:16] gelimarr: true
[5:05:18] warrenny: @tacduc Yup
[5:05:20] Jokervenom1978: Draka for Arbiter 2022.
[5:05:23] UltraKSlaya: yup
[5:05:23] CYNIC308: Genn Graymane is a goldmine of story if the use him right ... that dude has seen more shit than 99% of other mortals
[5:05:27] reinhardtdog: Why would people ask not to preorder that?
[5:05:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: They think WoW is a dead game LUL
[5:05:34] swordart2022: True KEKW
[5:05:35] gelimarr: I'm going to pre-order 100%
[5:05:35] redrobe: LUL
[5:05:36] unholyorc: imma buy that shit the moment its on the store.
[5:05:40] skylerNsadie: holy man, just went to watch Pyro's review on the xpac release. That might be some of the cringiest takes on a game in general ive ever seen.
[5:05:40] CYNIC308: just think of all the shit Genn has seen
[5:05:40] b_nannerz: Not to go too far back, but I used to love pyro and he just got too hateful and negative and it sucks not to be able to watch him. Your negative feedback over time doesn’t feel as malicious and hate-fueled which is refreshing
[5:05:44] warrenny: Preordering as soon as its avalible
[5:05:44] Bacanu34: true KEKW
[5:05:45] Fenrysz: how is the dragon xpac gonna be good?
[5:05:47] fewefaweawerwer: hype for DF but the dracthyr look so weird and ugly I don't want to preorder
[5:05:48] NeverStopRaging1: "really good" when u have been baited by a multi billion marketing team, KEKW
[5:05:49] mavericks312: hell show me the collectors edition already lol
[5:05:49] TheUnknowing: Look, I already know I'm gonna play the new expansion so might as well preorder it
[5:05:52] Mcaffee: Affliction still best spec for leveling new alt? 1-60
[5:05:53] ArcaneSyntax: I saw Quazii was high on FFXIV copium in his reaction to DF.
[5:05:53] ClayMatioNation: Some people just need to be negative for whatever reason
[5:05:57] Bayne77: THE JAILER HAD A TWIN BROTHER!
[5:05:58] Hawke_89: i mean...we were excited for Warfonts too....look where that took us LUL
[5:05:59] Kisswani: RoJ POGGERS
[5:06:01] willsilvey: Will we ever see the jailer again or is he to unpopular?
[5:06:02] Clicklesly: I mean, "Don't preorder" has always been a thing for games, not just WoW ^^
[5:06:02] itscityboy: why is he leveling again?
[5:06:03] warrenny: Cant wait for the new class
[5:06:04] TacDuc: If you're gonna play from day 1 anyways, then you might aswell just preorder
[5:06:04] ruhroraggy: YES DAY ONE
[5:06:06] Hitokiri83: Collectors edition when need my physical box
[5:06:07] Araphas: Don't see a point in pre-ordering a digital game, it's not like it is going to run out. But yea, other peoples money none of my buisness
[5:06:09] Fangy_Playz: @Towelliee All i wanna know is tortollan allied race when? I want to swim and say A TURTLE MADE IT TO THE WATER.
[5:06:13] MeisterPetze: World of Warcraft: There is still more Azerith
[5:06:16] ruhroraggy: HIGHEST VERSIOn
[5:06:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not getting the crazy package but I'll preorder the base
[5:06:20] Exxcar: @Araphas gooodies!
[5:06:21] mavericks312: baevanas effect
[5:06:22] Krimsonz23: We haven’t seen a talent system/talent tree since MOP. What are your thoughts about them being the talent system back?
[5:06:22] swordart2022: Gotta break Cyberpunk record
[5:06:23] Jokervenom1978: I was all set to pre-order on the 19th
[5:06:24] gelimarr: CHAMPION WOONZ
[5:06:25] Beardstain: I also think that they got the most returns as well for shadowlands
[5:06:25] taobender777: Dude… the xpac does look promising, but we don’t even know the details yet
[5:06:27] itscityboy: SL was exciting thats why
[5:06:31] unholyorc: by teasing the lich king YEP
[5:06:32] xxsargexx: gonna buy the most expensive edition. cant stop wont stop
[5:06:37] tovvani: i've had a lot of fun in 9.2, only problem im having is leggos for alts XD cleaning out all my gold
[5:06:40] UltraKSlaya: people thought it would be Legion 2.0
[5:06:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: it was 2020 we all were home and bored as fuck so we bought games
[5:06:43] warrenny: My 2nd fav expac
[5:06:43] SensationalBanana: There's a surprisingly high amount of people hinging their mental health on believing that WoW is performing badly. It hasn't been performing badly financially at any point. In WoD it made 800k USD on a bad year.
[5:06:44] invisiblematter: wow expansions are fun for most people, even haters, for at least a week
[5:06:46] Exxcar: Gotta get all them goodies
[5:06:47] gelimarr: @Towelliee can u do a magni voice
[5:06:49] ClayMatioNation: Towelie do you think Blizz is expecting Shadowlands numbers for Dragonflight?
[5:06:49] Reonan33: @Towelliee when you told us that 10.0 will be completely different some months ago - what have you mean with that now that we now some stuff?
[5:06:53] Jewishraver: hell i bought SL twice, epic digital and collectors. ill do the same with dragonflight
[5:06:54] hasan666: I will pre-order it. afraid if it will out of stock
[5:06:58] Teknofear64: They made the bonus objectives mych faster!
[5:07:09] JamboKong: everyone wants wow to be as we remembered from vanilla built off from that for today's age. we all want wow to do well and be good.
[5:07:10] scud3333: Did everyone forget we were all indoors when shadowlands was first out?
[5:07:14] SensationalBanana: @HaxzorJimDuggan Legion and BfA also broke sales records.
[5:07:14] Short_Film: Shadowlands may not be the worst expansion but it was probably my most disappointing one. Im optimistic for Dargonflight tho
[5:07:14] b_nannerz: Day one shadowlands was really fun! The drought of content is what the problem is and then all of the content that followed was underwhelming and just bad for regular players
[5:07:15] TommySeeker: is that more or less?
[5:07:15] cptrogers123: DRAGON DEEZ NUTS
[5:07:18] Pumpkinheadted: @Towelliee Hey! what exactly are you doing with the hunter? collecting covenant rewards ?
[5:07:21] CYNIC308: yea even haters come back to WoW every two years LUL
[5:07:25] mavericks312: no borrowed power and dragons
[5:07:28] Khade_Tyrson: @towelliee need to be lvl 60 to open box for skymane.
[5:07:29] Urnie09: yea thats what sold me lmao
[5:07:34] willsilvey: and new pvp gearing will be popular
[5:07:35] gelimarr: How to buy the collector's edition in EU?
[5:07:37] zekoush: I love new expansion. Only missing housing, but hey - maybe in the future :D
[5:07:39] Ortinoth: if Blizzard fixes the borrowed power issue and actually fix alot of the issues that most players have then the number will definately go up
[5:07:41] ArcaneSyntax: also internet dragons are the reason people play MMOs
[5:07:42] Beardstain: hehe
[5:07:43] Relic7: POGGERS
[5:07:45] assman_ny: It will be a big release.
[5:07:45] Reonan33: @Towelliee when you told us that 10.0 will be completely different some months ago - what have you mean with that now that we now some stuff?
[5:07:46] xxsargexx: @OBCole thats why im not bothering with legendaries for alts considering this expansion is nearing its end, might not be for a little while longer but eh i like my gold
[5:07:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: People love dragons, yeah
[5:07:51] EmperorSheol: i like the focus on existing systems. talents/crafting etc. NO BORROWED POWER
[5:07:52] taobender777: What if dragon riding sucks ?  It sounds good, but it’s still timegating our exploration
[5:07:56] UltraKSlaya: if only we kept the artifact weapons. All of this could have been prevented towCringe
[5:07:57] SensationalBanana: I was disappointed by no revamp of EK and Kalimdor, but perhaps next expansion.
[5:07:57] Dyasis: and ducks, don't forget the ducks
[5:08:00] KainhNZ: isn't it every expansion the players are just excited to be surrounded by tons of other players out in the world?
[5:08:04] TacDuc: I remember my luck in BfA meant that I raided with heirloom pants, for months...
[5:08:06] HaloS23: @Towelliee Id say Dragonflight has got alot of nostalgia points coming with it. It going to be Lit!
[5:08:08] Beardstain: the revamped talent tree looks amazing as well
[5:08:08] havenbirch: LARGE zones too
[5:08:09] ChimmyNeutron: @taobender777 It'll be fine
[5:08:13] Beardstain: about time
[5:08:13] padawanyolo: WHAT
[5:08:13] gelimarr: And tuskars
[5:08:14] yaji42069: ranked solo queue sounds fun to casually grind on
[5:08:14] mavericks312: and how to train your dragon
[5:08:15] CYNIC308: REAL TALENTS! (POE fanboy)
[5:08:15] EmperorSheol: ducks confirmed???
[5:08:16] Short_Film: i need a Duck mount
[5:08:18] padawanyolo: will there be ducks?
[5:08:18] PvtHudson093: I want a pet Duck
[5:08:18] Hungry_Sultan: dragon riding was giving how to train your dragon vibes
[5:08:19] Nathanonfire: talents arent revamped they  are just painted into a pretty  tree style but its basically the same talent system lol
[5:08:21] HaloS23: i missed the point on ducks....
[5:08:24] Alacod: I don't see Legion numbers but I think it's going to be good
[5:08:24] bumpstock75: i want a duck mount
[5:08:28] Ortinoth: @taobender777 i wouldn't say timegating at this moment as we haven't seen how its going to be
[5:08:29] gelimarr: yep
[5:08:32] lotheriann: Maybe some Monk st buffs. #mydream
[5:08:33] Kisswani: the zones themselves look beautiful , but sort of old school
[5:08:34] Relic7: KEKW
[5:08:36] spamusubi: True I'm preordering for the ducks
[5:08:38] CYNIC308: YEP
[5:08:40] TommySeeker: also can you even boost to 40 renown??
[5:08:41] DeanoTV: KEKW
[5:08:42] Praetour: You only choose if you're doing threads
[5:08:46] Elindalyne: would you rather fight 1 duck sized horse or 10 duck sized horses
[5:08:46] furiousee: @Nathanonfire have you seen enough of the talents to even say that?
[5:08:48] mavericks312: @Nathanonfire it would be easier to say you hate wow
[5:08:53] Exxcar: @Kisswani That's actually a reason I like them more
[5:08:54] Short_Film: feed me all the mighty ducks in game references
[5:08:54] Reonan33: @Towelliee when you told us that 10.0 will be completely different some months ago - what have you mean with that,now that we now some stuff?
[5:08:54] gelimarr: surv hunter dps?
[5:08:57] switchfoot__: PixelBob PixelBob PixelBob
[5:09:05] TacDuc: @Elindalyne I would make them join my army
[5:09:09] Khade_Tyrson: surv hunter is insane.
[5:09:12] Nathanonfire: i dont hate wow at all im  super excited about drangons
[5:09:13] ClayMatioNation: Do you remember being dumb at WoW ever? I once vendored a Sentry Cloak that was going for 50g on my server in Vanilla.
[5:09:16] Hungry_Sultan: yea melee hunter
[5:09:18] DuploThief: i hate the people that are like is this everything what a boring expansion nothing to do but screamt the hardest about borrowtpower being shit @towelliee
[5:09:20] Kisswani: @Exxcar Yeah , I loved Sl zones , but it was nice seeing the zones the showed
[5:09:21] TommySeeker: what
[5:09:27] justdave1961: People still play WOW? I played Shadowlands but I'm, like a lot of people, tired of grinding endless mats so you can grind other mats so you can grind....
[5:09:34] xaeblue: Towel prob cant divulge much more than what he's said
[5:09:45] tomcruise210: lol what about wrath unleashed? the no dungeon finder doesnt seem to be unleased to me
[5:09:50] DeanoTV: new class, race, talent tree revamp, prof revamp..wtf else do u want KEKW
[5:09:50] TommySeeker: ok you did not know any details at the time either?
[5:09:55] warrenny: No borrowed power is one completely differant
[5:09:58] tomcruise210: are they waiting for after ICC?
[5:10:05] Nathanonfire: @mavericks312   i absolutely love wow sorry to say you are wrong and im very  excited about dragon lands
[5:10:07] Ortinoth: still want my own niche in wow with housing - this should be account wide  :P
[5:10:10] Megatronxz: Ya'll gotta listen to him, he has sources within the company that let him know geez
[5:10:16] Reonan33: isnt that the same thing every expansion and then they still dissapoint us? @Towelliee
[5:10:16] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:10:16] DeanoTV: they done so much stuff for DF
[5:10:23] cabalish: i was so happy to just see them doing some things that we didnt have for the last years
[5:10:27] IianaDRK: out of curiosity how much of the announced stuff did u know?
[5:10:30] ClayMatioNation: They should do a battle pass that includes more dragon customizations
[5:10:34] Titosamson: @towelliee how you doin brotha.
[5:10:36] BeardedKuhn: @Towelliee  but did players reeeeaallly ask for a dragon class, that has the druid curse of not showing armor? =p
[5:10:37] switchfoot__: define not borrowed?
[5:10:40] Ortinoth: talents trees has been asked since its removal after mop
[5:10:45] xaeblue: i just wish i was a fly on the wall when u talk to your source PepeLaugh

[5:10:48] Elindalyne: the only other thing i want is some sort of deterministic bad luck protection similar to savage tomes in FF14
[5:10:50] KainhNZ: @cabalish bringing back the whistle through the dragonflight is pretty sweet
[5:10:52] Kisswani: Man , I can't wait for the pre expansion cinematics , like Afterlives Kreygasm
[5:10:57] xFevers: That goes away
[5:10:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Better than Legion would be awesome
[5:10:58] Reonan33: isnt that the same thing every expansion and then they still dissapoint us? @Towelliee
[5:11:01] MILESkg21: means NO MORE GRIND

[5:11:06] Skkold: Power that can stay for more than 1 expansion.
[5:11:06] Alacod: @switchfoot__ did you watch any of the knews?
[5:11:09] bumpstock75: maybe
[5:11:11] TacDuc: There are tier sets though
[5:11:15] SonofHorus82: "better than Legion" is a huuuuuuuuge challenge.
[5:11:19] furiousee: @Towelliee tier sets too right, technically "borrowed power" but more traditional
[5:11:19] nephttv_: @Towelliee Do you need keys this morning for your 3k after the 9 to 5?
[5:11:23] Ortinoth: there will always be somesort of grind
[5:11:25] xaeblue: @Elindalyne Pretty sure they pointed out that was a concept they were going after
[5:11:26] Kisswani: we need a grind of some sort
[5:11:28] Exxcar: I mean its already potentially the MOST alt friendly expansion in YEARS
[5:11:31] Urnie09: the grind is for gear now
[5:11:31] pereadin: @neph__98 he does
[5:11:34] ClayMatioNation: Compared to Shadowlands it's no grind, but it's still a grind
[5:11:35] EvilStreak: its an MMO!! Why would you want no grind?
[5:11:35] gelimarr: I want to raid in Dragonflight
[5:11:36] warrenny: @civlow Not everyone thats just a toxic vocal minority who shit on everything
[5:11:40] cabalish: @cabalish just seeing the blizz stuff talking new things after the long covid shit was great
[5:11:43] xaeblue: @Elindalyne I might be wrong, swore I heard that though
[5:11:52] pereadin: @neph__98 SoA and then one or two 22s or 23/.
[5:11:52] nephttv_: @pereadin dh got op trinket and 4set last night
[5:11:56] grey_rafa: I'm really excited about the Dragonflight Renowns!!
[5:12:04] Cruerider: I've no expectations from this expansion, in reality alts require sweat.
[5:12:04] tronbadgames: borrowed power doesn't have to not synergize..
[5:12:07] Spathotan: If youre saying "defined borrowed power" youre either being condescending or started playing the game in BFA.
[5:12:08] Myndjestyr: i mean technically gear is borrowed power
[5:12:08] Kisswani: I think what he meant is that you replace your tier sets every patch
[5:12:13] furiousee: @Towelliee have they said anything on the legendary situation?
[5:12:13] tronbadgames: tier sets have always been borrowed power
[5:12:15] gelimarr: mend pet
[5:12:15] pereadin: @neph__98 fuck yeah bro grats!
[5:12:18] Elindalyne: i didn't hear that, but it will be great if they do that
[5:12:19] Skkold: People are like "Please give me features so I don't have to play the game anymore."
[5:12:21] tronbadgames: just like all gear
[5:12:21] ClayMatioNation: What's a class that you never plan to play again?
[5:12:22] Reonan33: @Towelliee As a guy who started at Shadowlands and always hears "Legion was the best" - why was Legion so good? What was the Key things that made it so good?
[5:12:26] CYNIC308: Aspect Power is real ... only it applies to your custom mount not your gear and ilvl
[5:12:27] xXSiebzehnXx: I was just thinking. I’d do Sunken Temple as an M+
[5:12:29] Vuntrei: So, there is no borrowed power, and a reavamped talent tree? Sorry, haven't paid a lot of attention. Time to Resub. Also WOTLK Classic? Kreygasm
[5:12:31] tofuthief123: What UI addon is that?
[5:12:41] cabalish: @tofuthief123 elvui
[5:12:44] gelimarr: epic
[5:12:51] TommySeeker: intellect
[5:12:55] MILESkg21: INT KEKW
[5:12:56] Molvonos: @Towelliee Want your thoughts on Season 4.  You think gear that drops from the upgraded raids (CN, SoA) will be able to be made into Tier?  I'd love to see SoA sockets on Tier just to make that raid eve neasier.
[5:12:58] tofuthief123: @tofuthief123 thank you:)
[5:13:01] Reonan33: @Towelliee As a guy who started at Shadowlands and always hears "Legion was the best" - why was Legion so good? What was the Key things that made it so good?
[5:13:07] gelimarr: int fist weapon
[5:13:08] LeoMako: hunters can equip everything except wands and maces.
[5:13:08] xaeblue: every weapon = hunter prio 4Head
[5:13:17] duffluv22: I would like to see Towelliee as a healer...lol
[5:13:21] KronasKG: @Towelliee  you can wear 1 handers but some attracks require the two hander
[5:13:23] BeardedKuhn: since hunters used to be able to dual weild, they never removed that ability. even though survival can only swack with 2handers
[5:13:31] Kisswani: @Civlow almost every part of the game was viable and can reward you with great items . also , Mythic+ as a system was introduced in legion , which was a huge deal
[5:13:34] MeisterPetze: yes. sad
[5:13:52] MistaHat: !ui
[5:13:53] Moobot: @MistaHat TBC UI: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25206-TowellieesTBCClassicElvUICompilation169.html |SL UI: wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Check !Discord's pinned messages in the #cesspool channel for further installation details. Dont forget to make backups!
[5:13:55] pereadin: @civlow legion was the introduction of M+ and had all the systems we currently wanted such as tier and legends does with no AoE cap and no healer damage nerfs.
[5:14:01] Kisswani: @Civlow legendaries and artifact weapons were great everntually as well . but in general it was because you had a shit ton of stuff to do
[5:14:05] gelimarr: epic
[5:14:06] tonyr23: you guys see Mike Tyson punched a passenger on an airplane
[5:14:15] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Civlow (warning)
[5:14:18] nephttv_: @pereadin the big aoe is something i know we both miss
[5:14:28] gelimarr: tame him hehe
[5:14:39] MeisterPetze: this will be the first time i skill a season
[5:14:40] pereadin: @neph__98 100% true bro
[5:14:41] Kisswani: @pereadin holy paladins heal ? Kappa
[5:14:54] MILESkg21: https://twitter.com/UberFacts/status/1517450895046459393 Thers no wayt this stat is real KEKW
[5:14:55] pereadin: @kisswani KEKW
[5:15:02] gelimarr: mace bro
[5:15:04] furiousee: @Towelliee anything on legendaries yet?
[5:15:18] aghaomeed: had no idea hunters can be melee now lol
[5:15:23] Kisswani: @MilesKG21 half of that is Thdlock KEKW
[5:15:33] cptrogers123: Buy a wow token?
[5:15:36] nephttv_: ion said no leggos
[5:15:36] MILESkg21: Kisswani KEKW
[5:15:38] duffluv22: always items
[5:15:40] dright424: yeah
[5:15:40] SonofHorus82: I always just buy the already made enchants.
[5:15:40] Nachozdood: no leggos thank god
[5:15:44] temp3st98: They said that about bfa aswell
[5:15:44] ArcaneSyntax: not in 10.0 he said
[5:15:44] Coriollis: no, he sid not at starts or like mandatory
[5:15:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah no legos
[5:15:46] ohston: alpha already??
[5:15:47] rusherrusher: he said there might be like a sylvanas bow legendary but not craftable stuff
[5:15:49] VARlATlON: vendor shuffle with skinning and bow @Towelliee
[5:15:50] Praetour: No crafted/legion style legendaries more along the lines of Warglaives
[5:15:51] Digitree: he said they would be open to leggos like the sylvanas bow
[5:15:53] nephttv_: at MOST there might be leggos like sylv bow
[5:15:54] furiousee: oh wow, hardcore no borrowed power lol
[5:15:57] duffluv22: might be in tree later
[5:15:57] dright424: he said maybe something like the sylvannas bos
[5:15:59] Ryathael: Pretty sure its going back to the old style, not multiple ones at a time.
[5:15:59] dright424: bow*
[5:16:01] MILESkg21: crafted leggos would be good
[5:16:05] Ortinoth: he didn't say absolutely no legendaries
[5:16:16] propwash80: @Towelliee what spec you playing?
[5:16:16] havenbirch: Will there be World quests in 10.0?
[5:16:17] aghaomeed: hopefully thunderfury type legendaries only
[5:16:17] smashwow: tier sets
[5:16:24] gelimarr: I reckon good crafters can craft legendaries
[5:16:26] MeisterPetze: bfa was good
[5:16:28] Vuntrei: I like that. You had me at "No Borrowed Power" Kreygasm
[5:16:29] TacDuc: Storyline leggos are great
[5:16:32] Nachozdood: Classic leggos :P
[5:16:33] pereadin: Legendary powers can be found in the talent trees is what he also said.
[5:16:34] Fearmyrage_: waaaaay too many leggos in SL
[5:16:37] Elindalyne: my issue with those was there was no good catch up mechanic for alts
[5:16:38] furiousee: Maybe they're trying to funnel more dev time into features other than their traditional "systems"
[5:16:43] ArcaneSyntax: As long as there's plenty of alt catchup from the start, yes
[5:16:45] cabalish: dragon feather trinket leggo maybe
[5:16:48] Domini1001: @Towelliee  he did say no plans on leggos cause they want make cool talents instread of trying to fix classes with leggos
[5:16:50] xxsargexx: @sunnydains only if it makes sense
[5:16:51] aghaomeed: l
[5:16:55] icerasta: He said no Lego’s like legion or SL
[5:17:01] nephttv_: @pereadin Im excited to see what stuff from legion is in our talent trees
[5:17:06] tomcruise210: crafted gear thats equal to mythic is nice
[5:17:13] CYNIC308: new talent trees will be ever changing and balancing
[5:17:14] Urnie09: are leggos still a gazzillion gold?
[5:17:19] LumberChopMan: I have high hopes for professions, that's what I'm most excited for.
[5:17:22] itscityboy: yeah cause professions are nonexistent now
[5:17:26] temp3st98: I liked the mop legendary cloak
[5:17:38] raldrik: crafting is going to be bot central is my fear
[5:17:39] KainhNZ: or just get back Legion numbers of players...
[5:17:44] Mack1ee: Do you think due to how popular classics have been is why they’re trying to do more core game changes
[5:17:44] furiousee: @Towelliee do you think the "quality" system could turn into a situation where items won't sell unless they're max quality, which becomes the permanent baseline?
[5:17:45] pereadin: @neph__98 me too. I just also hope they revert the damage nerfs to holy Paladin that ashen attributed to.
[5:18:01] DrakeDuude: They are replacing Legendary menmories with Profession patterns i wonder?
[5:18:07] Elindalyne: @furiousee that's exactly what happens in ff
[5:18:10] nephttv_: @pereadin They have too i think, No shot you keep ashen and without it you have nothing
[5:18:16] havenbirch: I want a Wrathion legendary-like questline again
[5:18:18] Kisswani: @Biby07 it's kind of more specialized . there are talents for different crafting specializtions
[5:18:26] gelimarr: I would like that
[5:18:30] CrimsonGates: Do you think it's good for Blizzard to try and take inspiration from Vanilla WoW or do you think they should just try new things?
[5:18:39] tronbadgames: @Towelliee where is this whole "1 person" concept coming from? I'm pretty sure theyre just trying to have deeper specialization
[5:18:45] papascruge: Hopefully the craft recipes that are worth it aren't raid locked
[5:18:46] Sollice: I am so confused now with vestigaes and shit crafting legos lol
[5:18:49] EmperorSheol: still farming invincible so yea lol
[5:18:56] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee I think it's more likely a thing where you can only get the recipe if you are x spec in y crafting profession of z skill.
[5:18:57] CYNIC308: but how many blacksmiths will have spec into armor > plate > shoulders and then win the roll
[5:19:03] Buckwink: I want some badass engineering stuff!
[5:19:03] warrenny: No people are give now now now
[5:19:13] Kisswani: I'm only worried about how the community will set the gold costs for that . it has a potential to be too costly for most players to take part
[5:19:17] Coriollis: wotlk to an extent like , enchants from professions wotlk was awesome
[5:19:17] pereadin: @neph__98 I agree but you never know with blizz lol a return to old healer dps numbers/tuning would be amazing.
[5:19:19] cptrogers123: what i am excited for, is for sure the talent revamp
[5:19:22] SensationalBanana: I hope they update the animations for herbing, mining, skinning, crafting
[5:19:24] Domini1001: @Towelliee
[5:19:30] Domini1001: @Towelliee  WHERE ARE MY GOGLES?
[5:19:30] OmgItsEdizzle: Mahe engineering great again haha
[5:19:32] CYNIC308: recipe drops will be easy to roll on
[5:19:33] Buckwink: yeah everyone goes eng
[5:19:33] Finarato: yea
[5:19:33] Jokervenom1978: Im eager to get profession equipment.
[5:19:35] nephttv_: Engi is mandatory in m+
[5:19:35] lithium364: imagine the craftable BC weapons coming back
[5:19:37] cptrogers123: YEP
[5:19:48] Doom_Guy_01: I hope they have world drop recipes for professions so not everyone has a pattern
[5:19:48] furiousee: @Elindalyne well damn haha, and I don't even play FF. Maybe overall "quality" could be split between different attributes, like secondaries, such that at most only one secondary could be "maxed"
[5:19:55] pereadin: Yes
[5:19:55] PvtHudson093: I miss the profession bonus we had like extra stam if you were a minor
[5:20:00] duffluv22: scopes for hunters
[5:20:01] pereadin: Engibelt and brez
[5:20:02] cabalish: i never forget my first 10k gold buy from a tailer for an item only one guy could make on the server
[5:20:03] mavericks312: im excited to see them make tailoring relevent again
[5:20:06] CardinalTX: Make good profession dailies like in ESO
[5:20:14] TacDuc: They did mention a weaponsmith
[5:20:16] Jokervenom1978: Ion DID mention 2h swords
[5:20:23] TacDuc: And 2 handed as an example
[5:20:25] nephttv_: invis belt
[5:20:30] Hungry_Sultan: oh battle hilts from Wrath those weps were wanted
[5:20:40] breadwilton: why cant the items used to craft powerful weapons come from raids/dungeons so its the best of both worlds haha
[5:20:41] luhgator: what server do you play on?
[5:20:47] YNR_Chewmiester: Speaking of Engineering. In Wrath classic will Eng/Enchant combo be worth it for Prot Pally? Or should I just stick with Mine/Skin for money making?
[5:20:47] doogs44: should be able to craft heroic level gear for all slots with a reagent from the current tier of content imo
[5:20:52] nephttv_: its a tinker mod for any belt @Towelliee
[5:20:53] Kisswani: @Towelliee you think we will be able to place a work order for our alts ?
[5:20:57] pereadin: What I want is M+ gear swapping to return to the game.
[5:20:57] unholyorc: what invs belt ?
[5:20:58] cabalish: engi is very deep fun
[5:21:27] supernohva_xt: I just want it to be back like in BC where you are up on the plateau farming elementals all day!
[5:21:29] nickie6x: i miss the early wow crafting stuff like shield spikes, weapon chains, etc
[5:21:29] Ortinoth: you still have to give the non raiders a way to get equal gear levels
[5:21:32] gelimarr: this part, hehe
[5:21:32] pereadin: @unholyorc it’s a tinker option
[5:21:37] raye_gaming22: na he said the raids will drop BOP mats for those items oyu still ahve to raid
[5:21:48] doogs44: prob can also just put up a work order as a commission for just gold?
[5:22:13] Subjektive: i thought soulbound stuff can be crafted for other people even if they dont have that profession any more from work orders
[5:22:20] HaxzorJimDuggan: solution would be a cooldown on completing a work order
[5:22:20] mavericks312: or just limit work orders per person
[5:22:23] dright424: just give the powerful ones a cooldown
[5:22:26] Hungry_Sultan: i feel ike WA needs to be removed for raiding make it difficult and make people learn WA is like a crutch
[5:22:26] Doom_Guy_01: Will probably work like work orders in eve online
[5:22:29] Ortinoth: tsm has never been able to do that
[5:22:33] Sollice: All- To get rank 4 lego belt. I should have rank 2 belt crafted and than the mats for Vestiage?
[5:22:34] BeastaH: starting to sound like my real job
[5:22:34] itscityboy: I'd be a full time crafter is they do it right
[5:22:34] ijuki: @HaxzorJimDuggan 1 at the time would suffice
[5:22:35] Kisswani: can your alts accept your own work orders >
[5:22:35] Coriollis: most likely lets say u have the pattern of best sword on server, u will have cd on that
[5:22:38] Nepsurf: A lot of questions
[5:22:39] Ortinoth: and i doubt it will be a feature of it
[5:22:45] furiousee: @Towelliee and having blacksmithing gear be BoP but still tradable naturally creates more player-player interaction than just buying BoE off the AH
[5:22:46] duffluv22: i am not a robot
[5:22:49] Volkien: What if I pick up a work order and log off for 3 months?
[5:22:50] raye_gaming22: so you kill mythic boss and he drops 3x materials and youill go to the workorder and ask some one to craft a item out of it for you
[5:22:52] Vuntrei: Sadge
[5:22:58] kumah_1: oof
[5:22:58] JamboKong: hopefully a limit on how many you can do but then again you should be able to still be able to go to the crafter for them to craft the item or gear
[5:22:59] doogs44: @hungry_sultan I agree, get rid of the damage meters too
[5:23:10] pereadin: Increase?!
[5:23:10] CYNIC308: EVE is amazing but it is literally a second job and then some
[5:23:13] pereadin: Weirdge
[5:23:18] itscityboy: oh thats not bad
[5:23:20] gelimarr: 19 sheeeesh
[5:23:25] ADDICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: Thats fucked up
[5:23:30] Nutsy: Inflation
[5:23:31] furiousee: wtf lol
[5:23:36] ConleyD97: whooo
[5:23:36] mrpresbaby: I'm out
[5:23:38] BrotherBeezy: shhh, don't give them ideas
[5:23:39] itscityboy: well if its the main game you play, what's $4
[5:23:42] TeejayOCE: Aussies pay $20 a month for WoW
[5:23:43] chopsaki: been paying $20+ for years

[6:02:20] shmokindoink: @Towelliee just came back since nathria times. Any way to speed run catching up?
[6:02:29] CritcobainTV: @the_dunkfather Hes prot :D
[6:02:41] tomcruise210: id probably use it tbh
[6:02:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: They said the new UI will switch between Horde and Alliance, which is a little something
[6:02:45] Lulaboo: whats the green and orange for?
[6:02:45] FdMrr: about time
[6:03:01] callmestray: I try to use little UI add ons. the different layouts for when you switch specs will be nice
[6:03:07] temp3st98: I use an addon for the classic ui :)
[6:03:12] Jarlan23: ill probably uninstall bartender and sexymap when dragonflight comes out
[6:03:14] Jarlan23: plater too
[6:03:15] Greatmalinkoman2008: Greatmalinkoman2008 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[6:04:12] ijuki: @Jarlan23 ElvUI would probably be uninstalled too for me
[6:04:13] Belasard: i think who didnt like to use elvui or similar today, would not like to many changes to the ui. so the new one fits to that.
[6:04:18] Russclarto: Russclarto subscribed with Prime. 
[6:04:23] DankFarik: gd thing there is feign death
[6:04:49] Nutsy: They should remove and bann dps meters like in FF14
[6:05:03] Jarlan23: they 100% should update the bags too
[6:05:08] Jarlan23: bag addon is a game changer
[6:05:08] the_dunkfather: unpopular opinion here, but I think they should ban third party UI and make everyone use theirs so everyone is on the same playing ground, and they can focus on balancing the game and not these intricate UI's as well.
[6:05:11] Merex760: Either add super common addons or break things imo. Somehow the barrier to content needs to be decreased a bit
[6:05:23] ijuki: @Nutsy They do not ban dps meters, only if you talk about dps meters and their dps in FFXIV
[6:05:48] Omega12121212: what race and class do you recommend for absolute wow beginner
[6:06:05] ijuki: @Omega12121212 What do you want to play? Tank, dps or healer?
[6:06:11] kusk62: kusk62 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[6:06:13] DeanoTV: @Omega12121212 race doesn't really matter, hunter is ez dps
[6:06:22] ijuki: Also, dps is divided into ranged and melee
[6:06:23] Belasard: @the_dunkfather this might be actually the first step to that. they first have to look how many people use the new default. if its enough rules like that might come.
[6:06:23] Jarlan23: @the_dunkfather i wouldnt be against that
[6:06:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the racial differences are pretty small, I would say to go with what you like best
[6:07:03] Jetdrata: Jetdrata subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[6:07:18] ijuki: @the_dunkfather Easier solution, make all bosses do random actions at random times, would break the use of WA
[6:07:31] tomcruise210: was just thinking that \
[6:07:44] dannyis1337: chance on hit to teleport you to goldshire inn to dance for money
[6:07:47] BrotherBeezy: I hope their racial is just that smoke comes out of their nose.
[6:07:47] PanoramicPanda: I wish my social anxiety was light enough that I could actually get in with guild that does any form of content
[6:07:49] ijuki: They will use deep breath as racial
[6:07:51] HaxzorJimDuggan: i think we should be able to cook food without a campfire because we use our breath LUL
[6:07:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: The difference in raw DPS between best and worst race is like 1.3%
[6:08:04] YNR_Chewmiester: Racial? Nah I want to know what the Emotes are. Gotta see that /flirt and /silly
[6:08:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: For Survival hunter, as an example
[6:08:11] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee they already said tailswipe, wing buffet and there flying thing they do
[6:08:16] Frozen_DK: did they say if you have to be in dragon form in combat or if you can use the humanoid form ? i kinda dont like the dragons
[6:08:20] Koolsouthpaw: they might though.  no other MMO allows addons like this that i know of
[6:08:27] JamboKong: just doing away with combat add-ons that are relevant to boss fights and such I think wouldn't be so bad
[6:08:29] blackknightwing19: @Towelliee  what UI are you using
[6:08:32] AlfTheAce: balancing raids around weak auras sucks i hate raiding rn @Towelliee
[6:08:36] dannywow: !ui

[6:08:42] Naturalbeef: Imagine caring about other people's UI
[6:08:48] duffluv22: Dragon Screech
[6:09:00] CardinalTX: I use WA but other than that its basic UI
[6:09:02] the_dunkfather: Not so much balance but think about it... you have to use third party addons to make their game playable.... think of another top tier game like that? PLus pvp as well
[6:09:05] hatsihansu: @AlfTheAce was stated by wf guilds that you don't need weakauras for most bosses even on mythic
[6:09:09] taobender777: The way I look at flight is like this… for over a decade Blizzard encouraged us to farm flying mounts…. Now they tell us you can’t use them …. WTF is that ?
[6:09:14] Ciefon: blizz designs encounters around addons so if you don't use them you're at a disadvantage
[6:09:25] ArcaneSyntax: I use class WA but that's it.
[6:09:38] JamboKong: their racial is probably flying around (levitating)  x amount of time increasing speed
[6:09:38] mrniceguy817: @the_dunkfather You don’t need addons to play though
[6:09:58] Jarlan23: at a high level you do
[6:10:08] ijuki: Also, you can use addons without playing... oh wait you can't PepeHands
[6:10:10] duffluv22: Everyone uses DBM...
[6:10:12] mrniceguy817: You literally don’t
[6:10:14] MILESkg21: if you're part of the 1% then u probably do
[6:10:15] the_dunkfather: @mrniceguy817 massive disadvantage if you dont
[6:10:19] JamboKong: if you don't think boss fights are built with 3rd party combat add-ons being prevalent your being willfully ignorant

[6:10:38] mrniceguy817: I’m not saying it’s not an advantage I’m just saying you don’t HAVE to
[6:10:40] the_dunkfather: lol i said it was an unpopular opinion
[6:10:46] duffluv22: @ijuki lol
[6:10:48] ArcaneSyntax: I use little/big wigs and class WA. everything else is ui or fun oriented.
[6:11:29] ijuki: The thing is... removing WA will break bigwigs and DBM so that is not happening (anytime soon)

[6:57:25] Archiee: idk, Tazavesh is pretty rough
[6:57:37] Molvonos: @Sollice You generally want to clear it completely so you get all the anima powers, because the levels continue to scale since there's like, four wings or so vs. just one.  So by the fourth wing, you've got 4 debuffs chewing you up potentially.
[6:57:38] ijuki: @Sollice I would get as many powers as possible, but it depends on your class and skill I guess
[6:57:42] 3663Sharad: Towel hates PF, so Ion himself will integrate it into DF Season 1 KEKW Kappa
