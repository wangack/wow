[0:14:07] uskdksbih: !drops
[0:15:19] kingoftheregion: @cyrex172 maybe i just watch Asmondgold too much who has everything in the game, probably not realistic for most players
[0:15:38] cyrex172: @kingoftheregion its just a fun game man nothing quite like wow.  i had to come back and put some faith in the new ownership,, the free cosmetic battlepass is SUCH a. good sign
[0:15:58] cyrex172: i say free but it Should alwyas be free since we pay subscription

[0:18:36] ClassicMalcontent: @cyrex172 MS deal has not gone through and may still be blocked from going through. Whatever this is is not 'MS' it's still Blizzard trying to retain and increase Subs to show their earnings potential to anyone who may be willing to buy them.
[0:18:49] kingoftheregion: I like the song Warbringers: Jaina
[0:19:00] cyrex172: @ClassicMalcontent oh shit
[0:19:07] TheCakeBadger: I wiuld love to see WoW  or a  new Blizzard MMO in Unreal Engine in the next 5-10 years though
[0:19:16] cyrex172: @ClassicMalcontent thats not good

[0:19:32] TheCakeBadger: or a new Blizzard Engine.
[0:19:37] ClassicMalcontent: @cyrex172  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=microsoft+activision+deal+blocked
[0:19:38] Thoreya: that deal is gonna go thru, other gaming companies just have their panties in a bunch

[0:20:06] cyrex172: i have a question
[0:20:14] TheCakeBadger: towRedwing towRed towFire2
[0:20:20] cyrex172: why the fuck was activision allowed to buy blizzard but microsoft cant?
[0:20:24] ClassicMalcontent: @Thoreya they'll just have to give the FTC 'a little on the side' as it's not 'other gaming co' but the Fed blocking it.
[0:20:44] Thoreya: yea
[0:20:54] Noshpan: Sony's the one behind blocking the deal. They don't want the possibility of Call of Doody to no longer be a Playstation exclusive
[0:21:06] Thoreya: ^
[0:21:10] cyrex172: luls
[0:21:26] cyrex172: sony trying to cuck miscrosoft thats so petty
[0:21:31] cyrex172: haha
[0:21:32] TheCakeBadger: In my uneducated views, Microsoft has its fingers in many more digital "pies" than Activision
[0:21:39] ClassicMalcontent: It doesn't matter who is 'behind it' the FTC is running with it.  https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html
[0:21:44] kingoftheregion: @TheCakeBadger Yes, this also allow for new players to be part of a Blizzard mmo from the start
[0:21:50] cyrex172: sony can fucking try and buy blizzard too no need to be salty
[0:21:56] TheCakeBadger: thats why there is more opposition
[0:22:15] kingoftheregion: im might just get into Diablo 4 from the start so i dont fall behind
[0:22:22] ClassicMalcontent: Will it go through? Probably in the end. Has it yet? No.
[0:22:33] Noshpan: I wouldn't trust Sony with another MMO.
[0:22:44] cyrex172: true

[0:23:35] kingoftheregion: every since gamepass i like Xbox more than Sony, they seem very consumer friendly
[0:23:37] cyrex172: i loved swg before the re vamp tho
[0:23:47] cyrex172: they sure fucked up everquest huh
[0:24:03] Noshpan: When their PSN was hacked years ago, I could not adjust, or cancel my sub to EQ2 because they had shut off access to everything under Sony Online Entertainment
[0:24:13] TheCakeBadger: Yeah I loved it all. I am not fussy. I loved the complexities. I can understand why it doesn't appeal to the masses
[0:24:26] cyrex172: @Noshpan jesus
[0:25:27] cyrex172: @TheCakeBadger the ultima online style of game is my favorite style of mmo
[0:25:43] cyrex172: but it just seems to be a dead gameplay style
[0:26:03] cyrex172: nobody wants true sandboxes anymore they want themeparks. , i love themeparks dont get me wrong

[4:38:07] FiKnight: It will be interesting to see what Gunn does with the DCU.
[4:38:15] Sollice: How about they stop trying to counter Marvel and just do DC things
[4:38:18] c0mmander_starscream: IF Star Wars can CGI dead people playing roles they can make Cavil young

[4:39:00] Quazzy95: do the old expansion dung for M+ get changed per week or per season?
[4:39:08] HaloS23: @c0mmander_starscream under that logic, just make all movies full CGI, just add voices.
[4:39:08] ArcaneSyntax: I think none of the actors in justice league are gonna be back
