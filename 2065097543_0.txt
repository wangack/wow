[3:24:08] Valerathin: Valerathin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[3:24:10] MaybeRespect: All DK had was damage. IMO to be broken you need at least 2 of the 3 categories - dmg / defense / util
[3:24:24] hoaylander: everyone above 70 IQ can play dk. you need at least 150 to play outlaw rogue
[3:24:44] dooshken: DK prolly my favorite class before Legion. Then they made all the specs singular and it has been pretty lame since
[3:24:52] enhancedrane: damn, nice cut on the hairs
[3:25:26] Machinecoach: I think dk needs rework though, like every time this hero class is like chains of ice kiting until slappyhands it just makes me feel like something is off. They doing what they have to but like probably not what was intended to be the play style
