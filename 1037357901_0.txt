[3:55:45] pewtanblot: Yes @aFrowningBear
[3:55:51] Smith6612: @siikarapuli Jake and Wawa share the same connection. Timbo has his own connection but they are on the same Cable node
[3:55:52] pewtanblot: The only provider in their area

[3:58:16] jussttdee: @pewtanblot hachuStop
[3:58:33] siikarapuli: i remember the time i played games and when someone else uses internet it started to lag like hell :D
[3:58:35] Smith6612: @kaze_17 So cable systems work using radio waves basically. Somewhere between the Spectrum main office and the house, there is Fiber Optic cabling which connects up to a box which converts between RF Signal and Fiber. The node is the collection of all devices on the "RF" part of the connection. Cable boxes, Cable modems, Wi-Fi hotspots, etc.
[3:58:37] Pwnerfox: nice
[3:58:43] Andles1: @LUCiLUc19 gotta make the clone suck my dick first of all
[3:59:01] gritz_n_pitz: @WAYT
[3:59:05] gritz_n_pitz: WAYTOODANK
[3:59:25] pewtanblot: @WAYT
[3:59:30] Smith6612: @kaze_17 Now the problem is, the Fiber is merely a carrier for the RF signal to get to Spectrum's office. The Fiber connects into a Fiber port on a device called a CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System). Which you can think of like an Ethernet port on your router. Has a fixed amount of bandwidth, and you can plug multiple things into it.
[3:59:32] kaze_17: @smith6612 Ah, I see. Thank you for explaining

[4:00:30] SukoSeiti: kekw
[4:00:30] kaze_17: @smith6612 monkaHmm that second part is still a little confusing. Thanks!
[4:00:33] Smith6612: @kaze_17 So what happens is, that single port is like the water line coming into a house. Except it's shard with everyone. If too many faucets are open at one time, water pressure drops. All Internet connections work in the same way. If the shared point is getting too much demand, it messes up. Cable, unfortunately, has very limited bandwidth on the upload, which is what Jake needs the most to Stream.
[4:00:35] kaze_17: @sukoseiti Kissahomie
[4:01:02] kaze_17: @smith6612 oh! that third part makes more sense to me.

[4:01:31] josgar1017: Pog
[4:01:38] Knoives: all that platforming Pog
[4:01:50] aFrowningBear: @Smith6612 basically every connection is shared, business line have prio right?
[4:02:08] Smith6612: @kaze_17 now the other problem is, not all faucets are the same. Some faucets leak. Some faucets have larger pipes or outlets. Leaky faucets take away from the total amount of water that gets to a person. Spectrum, because Cable modem is RF, deals with that via RF Noise. Aka garbage radio signals that cause interference.
[4:02:40] Smith6612: @kaze_17 The other issue is, people may have bigger pipes if they paid for it. But that bigger pipe gets equal pressure when there is too much demand to everyone else.
[4:02:42] jussttdee: Sadge
[4:03:14] SnakeEaterl999: us dont pay the rent LULW
[4:03:20] Smith6612: @aFrowningBear Yes everything is shared. If you want guaranteed bandwidth you have to pay for that guarantee end to end. Usually that's common only between datacenters or between two locations (We call that, Point to Point bandwidth)
[4:03:24] kaze_17: @smith6612 then what's the point of paying more?
[4:03:40] jussttdee: KEKW
[4:03:44] bliffy___: KEKW
[4:03:55] jussttdee: Pog
[4:03:58] kaze_17: does spectrum have a monopoly in Pasadena?
[4:03:58] Smith6612: @aFrowningBear But Spectrum does not prioritize Business Cable Internet over Residential Cable Internet. You pay more so they don't scream if you use tons of bandwidth, even though they don't have caps.
[4:03:59] jussttdee: LETS GO WAWA
[4:04:10] Smith6612: @aFrowningBear You do get faster support than residential, though.
[4:04:52] Smith6612: @aFrowningBear Spectrum does sell Fiber Internet. You have to be in one of their new areas where it's Fiber to the Home. They do exist! Otherwise you're buying service from Spectrum Enterprise at $$$$
[4:05:07] siikarapuli: how much do people pay for internet? speed and monthly payment
[4:05:33] Smith6612: @siikarapuli Spectrum charges a minimum of $75 USD/m for 200Mbps/10Mbps...
[4:06:01] burts: LUL
[4:06:03] siikarapuli: my 4G 100mb/s 29,90/month
[4:06:05] SnakeEaterl999: WOW that upload is terrible
[4:06:16] Smith6612: @siikarapuli Their 400Mbps/20Mbps plan is $95/m. Gigabit is $135/m for 1,200Mbps down, 35Mbps up KEKW
[4:06:25] Smith6612: Oh and they charge you $200 just to order Gigabit.
[4:06:32] siikarapuli: 29,90eur*
[4:06:34] FCLiver: NA internet wawaPain
[4:06:48] siikarapuli: @smith6612 wow
[4:06:49] Smith6612: @NoLiverNo Sadge
[4:06:53] SnakeEaterl999: wtf 200
[4:07:56] tojitakeda: 20/month @ 20 mbps OMEGALUL sea internet
[4:07:56] siikarapuli: 4G 100mb/s no limit 29,90€/month in Finland
[4:08:28] LUCiLUc19: I think you are blessed if you have internet regardless
[4:08:37] FCLiver: ^ true
[4:08:43] Smith6612: Anyways... @kaze_17 @aFrowningBear To put this into perspective... Spectrum has on average 2Gbps - 2.4Gbps download to share with the whole node. But only 100Mbps Upload to share with the whole node. A cable node can hav anywhere from 80 modems to 500 modems. Spectrum averages around 300 modems per node.
[4:08:43] SnakeEaterl999: i pay £42.00 a month 500 down and 500up
[4:09:10] FCLiver: i pay like 70 for 100mps wawaPain
[4:09:10] amv1: i pay about $7 for 100/100mbs fiber at my home, EU. can get up to 500mbs but eh, no need for that.
[4:09:13] kaze_17: @smith6612 terrible
[4:09:18] Lokitox8: KEKW
[4:09:35] siikarapuli: @amv1 nice
[4:09:49] jussttdee: KEKW
[4:10:07] jussttdee: tricia3Birbpog
[4:10:28] Smith6612: @kaze_17 Yeah... and Fiber providers like AT&T use either GPON or XGS-PON Fiber. GPON shares 2.4Gbps down, 1.2Gbps up with up to 64 connections. XGS-PON shares 10Gbps / 10Gbps with up to 64 connections. Most providers like AT&T do 32 split (32 connections) per Fiber. So that means you're sharing 10Gbps in both directions with up to 32 people over a single Fiber.
[4:10:40] Smith6612: So Fiber is SeemsGood vastly superior
[4:10:41] gritz_n_pitz: @NoLiverNo i pay like 95 for 400 down
[4:10:55] Smith6612: Also Fiber is much, much cheaper to maintain over time.

[4:11:52] gritz_n_pitz: LUL
[4:12:27] Smith6612: @kaze_17 Yeah Fiber is the way to go. All ISPs should be using Fiber at this point
[4:12:47] Smith6612: @kaze_17 Many of them want to try 5G Wireless to the home. But I don't think 5G is going to be cost effective OR capacity effective long term. It's convenient, yeah :)

[4:13:12] relicta: 4 then 5?
[4:13:24] siikarapuli: oh... old times having 1mbps. only one can use internet, otherwise it started to lag :D
[4:14:00] siikarapuli: is star link going to be game changer?
[4:14:23] Smith6612: @siikarapuli It'll be good for rural Internet and as a backup connection. The whole country can't hop on it though.
