[0:14:41] Big_Rum: Hello There!
[0:14:56] Big_Rum: How bout that ol' American nightmare!
[0:15:16] Pandachoww: ayo chief hows it going!?
[0:15:29] physalis4: how was your weekend
[0:15:35] KabalisK: General Bim-Rum
[0:15:48] Pandachoww: the womens Rumble was great
[0:15:51] 324bee21: I stayed up midnight my time watching it on bed on my phone lol had to let the wife sleep
[0:15:52] Big_Rum: Girl Rumble wa better
[0:15:58] calphan84: calphan84 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! good morning everyone
[0:16:06] 324bee21: R-Truth was absolutely golden in his spots
[0:16:16] CloudyHS: whos ready for a news packed week
[0:16:50] 324bee21: I guess that means all the Rock rumors are done, at least til next year
[0:17:26] SlithTheSivak: we should start off the day strong by having everyone oogle my ai art summonings on mmochamp
[0:17:29] Haestoh: the fact they acknowledged she was from TNA and actually gave her good spots. TNA/WWE friendly partnership is good for wrestling
[0:17:50] CloudyHS: eh i mean i get it, people remember, but u cant have every bit of news occupy ur brain all the time, it sucks but nobody has the bandwidth for that
[0:17:54] Pandachoww: @324bee21 I was dying over that XD
[0:17:56] yuldovah42: do we know if the AOTC mount is going to get re-colored?
[0:18:01] Pumba2988: 1900 people sounds like alot from the Blizzard team wtf
[0:18:05] Pandachoww: truth being truth
[0:18:12] physalis4: people love to gatekeep
[0:18:27] databob1: No still kinda pissed about the 1900 people
[0:18:33] Xesol: you have the achievement to show when you got it, who cares if someone else has it
[0:18:50] CloudyHS: its probably gonna be something to do with the timerunning pandamonium
[0:19:41] physalis4: How funny would it be if there was a bug that awarded the AOTC achievement when you bought it off the TP LUL
[0:19:43] CloudyHS: i think itll make more sense if it has something to do with timerunning pandamonium, cuz then its not just a random choice, its tied to the content
[0:19:45] CloudyHS: imo
[0:19:54] Suze_o_0: @Pandachoww you're here too?!
[0:20:07] 324bee21: it doesn't mean much either way, noone who gets it would actually use it and noone who has it uses it now
[0:20:09] JakeSezz: The best comparison I saw was a “hey look they have the same car as us!” and then promptly drive their car off the cliff 😂
[0:20:10] physalis4: I think you got the recruit a friend achievement when you got the fire horse
[0:20:43] CloudyHS: datamining with like 20% of the whole picture causing drama
[0:20:46] CloudyHS: who coulda seen that coming
[0:21:05] JakeSezz: I dunno, I feel like the community has doctorate level experience in complaining and I have a hard time feeling sympathy
[0:21:10] CloudyHS: ^^^
[0:21:15] Big_Rum: So Cm Punk Will liklly face Seth Freakin Rollins at Mania yeah?
[0:21:24] Suze_o_0: ooooooooo Dojo rocks!
[0:21:27] Pandachoww: oh we're getting a trailer? sick
[0:21:39] Pandachoww: @Suze_o_0 always
[0:21:43] SlithTheSivak: Coolio!
[0:21:52] CloudyHS: rip coolio
[0:22:13] CloudyHS: inception monkaS
[0:22:15] Big_Rum: Dope
[0:22:20] lyreilla: I like it!
[0:22:34] CloudyHS: whats this trailer for sorry i missed it
[0:22:40] Suze_o_0: awesome!
[0:22:43] SlithTheSivak: this doesnt sound like gangsters paradise...
[0:22:43] Pandachoww: ngl....gave me chills that
[0:23:02] CloudyHS: not me :)
[0:23:03] physalis4: hi
[0:23:03] Suze_o_0: here!
[0:23:06] BBMezzy: mrgmLunaPog
[0:23:06] bysho: hey, hope everything ok
[0:23:09] Larkaro: gday
[0:23:14] Pumba2988: yo yo
[0:23:17] lyreilla: Hiii
[0:23:23] ImperfectDark: anseo! (here)
[0:23:25] JakeSezz: saltyb27Cheers saltyb27Cheers
[0:23:29] TruVillainManny: shout out to all those amazing people
[0:23:44] bysho: one question the Wow pictures on the wall are from the blizzard store?
[0:23:45] Haestoh: yo yo
[0:24:18] Layliah79: Happy Monday!!! elybroLurk in a meeting!
[0:24:59] ImperfectDark: ooh 2WEI do some nice covers. Traitors on BBC used one or two of them
[0:25:09] physalis4: endless TP possibilities
[0:25:14] bysho: one question the Wow pictures on the wall are from the blizzard store?
[0:25:31] TruVillainManny: My hot take. They should stop doing AotC mounts entirely.
[0:26:25] physalis4: Nah it's a good reward
[0:26:53] JakeSezz: Oooooooh I like that Manny mrgmLunaPog
[0:26:56] Xesol: they should do more things like the viscous saddles - if you get aotc, then get it on another char, you can get an older mount
[0:27:10] nuclearphosphate: hey stranger
[0:27:29] RAF_Sean: Giod morning sir!
[0:27:40] nuclearphosphate: whatcha investigating
[0:28:21] TruVillainManny: @physalis4 People say that the main way people get it is through paying for carries. Rather than add to that they should no longer incentivize those runs.
[0:28:52] nuclearphosphate: ive got that pet :D
[0:28:57] Haestoh: My hot take, I don't think anything previously removed from the game should be brought back. If you missed out on it that's too bad. I'd like to be able to go and buy the TGC cards at retail price to get a spectral tiger, but I can't and I made peace with it.
[0:28:59] nuclearphosphate: and that one
[0:29:09] physalis4: Yeah you had to gift for tha
[0:29:11] physalis4: *that
[0:29:18] Pandachoww: wasnt he a twitch drop fairly recently??
[0:29:22] ChrisStoll: Gifters in shambles
[0:29:24] TruVillainManny: Also it's just pixels so they should through it on the BMAH and reduce gold inflation.
[0:29:36] Robodope: put the big blizzard bear on there and lets get the real drama started
[0:29:43] Suze_o_0: i have ichabod :)
[0:29:43] TruVillainManny: *throw not through
[0:29:46] Pandachoww: i remember streaming and people getting the ichabod pet as a drop i swear
[0:29:50] nuclearphosphate: @imjoeski i got the swift spectral tiger and spectral tiger cub randomly traded to me ingame last month haha, simply said "have fun" :D
[0:30:04] Pandachoww: ah yes yes
[0:30:07] s7wede: As somebody has every single AOTC mount in wow, I'm so glad they are giving more people a chance to obtain these mounts. Nothing should be lost to time in a pay to play game
[0:30:14] nuclearphosphate: it was a twitch drop @MrGM the ichabod
[0:30:15] physalis4: Turkey is really old
[0:30:26] nuclearphosphate: huh
[0:30:48] Pandachoww: yeah it was the sub one...there was another thing that was a drop at the same time
[0:30:52] ImperfectDark: @imjoeski as someone who only started playing WoW since Shadowlands, i actually agree with you! I do a lot of mount hunting and i'd hate for things to suddenly become insta-purchaseable, lol
[0:30:52] TruVillainManny: It was the first support a creator program for wow right?
[0:31:05] Pandachoww: it was the feldrake! yeye i remember now
[0:31:16] nuclearphosphate: @ImperfectDark i'd love for them to come to the trading post tbh
[0:31:18] physalis4: Time to burn down twitter
[0:31:27] physalis4: If ppl were mad not LUL

[0:33:24] physalis4: I went back to be sure, and we did in fact get the recruit a friend achievement with the Cindermane TP mount.
[0:33:26] s7wede: Those insane values could mean they are monthly rewards
[0:33:28] nuclearphosphate: 5677 tender? f**k that
[0:33:55] physalis4: no
[0:33:57] nuclearphosphate: @s7wede possibly?
[0:33:58] zNzUV: i think it did
[0:34:00] zNzUV: not 100%
[0:34:09] SlithTheSivak: thats the honor 400
[0:34:13] illidari_Neeko: Good Afternoon @mrgm Hope your having an amazing day dude! 😎
[0:34:51] physalis4: 4 Loko why?
[0:35:16] mattyzees: Maybe the high tenders and odd items are to do with the 'pirate patch'. ☠️
[0:35:19] TruVillainManny: I watched the Rumble this weekend and I will NOT be getting up at 5am for the next PPV.
[0:35:28] TruVillainManny: I am now an old man
[0:35:40] nuclearphosphate: saw the kor'kron wolf showing on that site you were looking at, im probably in the minority im not a fan of how that looks
[0:36:00] Pandachoww: thankfully im pretty used to staying up late XD
[0:36:25] Pumba2988: whats 281 mean
[0:36:30] Suze_o_0: omg, SO many people were complaining about lag last night in the raid
[0:36:45] Pandachoww: last night i was in bed by like midnight, thats super early for me
[0:37:02] s7wede: 1.5k more rep and I'm done with  the archive rep grind for good!
[0:37:09] Endtree: wait i read something in reddit today that you can unlock all armor and weapon tmogs on one character, is it true?
[0:37:12] nuclearphosphate: im normally in bed by around 10PM, no thanks to the back damage i have
[0:37:37] Endtree: kay, thank :)
[0:38:13] s7wede: @MrGM If you are talking about the meta achievement, you can get them all apart from Just one More thing which will take another 7 weeks for everybody if you do every world quest
[0:38:25] RAF_Sean: I lowkey miss mission tables
[0:38:42] s7wede: The Archives Called, You Answered
[0:38:42] nuclearphosphate: i cant stand the mission tables
[0:38:56] Pumba2988: Random but not sure if your into darts at all but there is a 16yr old British kid Luke Littler absolutely smashing the world champs.
[0:39:02] Suze_o_0: ok, serious question for you. What is the main difference between you using Zygor and ATT addons? besides a cost
[0:39:25] BritishRaven: beer and kebabs
[0:40:07] s7wede: Zygor is a guide while ATT is just a database. Think about it as an in-game wowhead without comments actually telling you how to get the item
[0:40:23] nuclearphosphate: @BritishRaven im "up north" (middle of scotland) and can confirm, i cannot stand beer (or alcohol) and also kebabs
[0:40:35] BritishRaven: Maybe we need to study @nuclearphosphate LUL
[0:40:48] nuclearphosphate: just to quash the rumours of scottish people
[0:40:55] nuclearphosphate: nah, been in scotland all my life
[0:41:09] nuclearphosphate: fuckin eww
[0:41:56] nuclearphosphate: if i hear ANYTHING else about that friggin game im gonna go insane
[0:42:32] nuclearphosphate: yeah its shite
[0:42:40] s7wede: It's a banger
[0:42:44] nuclearphosphate: cannot understand the hype about it
[0:42:57] ImperfectDark: it must have some appeal
[0:42:58] nuclearphosphate: i barely managed 10 minutes with it
[0:43:00] Pandachoww: steam stats would highly disagree
[0:43:09] Daice_Live: 4 raiders from Daice_Live have joined! 
[0:43:18] Pandachoww: of all time
[0:43:28] nuclearphosphate: its deffo gonna be a short burn then no one is gonna touch it
[0:43:43] s7wede: Lol @ that take
[0:43:49] s7wede: it has a roadmap
[0:43:58] DNSola: Hi MrGM, took a Zygor sub with ur code last week, this is a very cool addon :) thanks !
[0:44:03] nuclearphosphate: the devs have abandoned their previous games as well so the longevity of it is HIGHLY sus#
[0:44:19] nuclearphosphate: @s7wede the devs previous games ALSO had a roadmap, yet they still abandoned them
[0:44:22] Pandachoww: time will tel
[0:44:36] s7wede: @MrGM 110%
[0:44:41] s7wede: they are focussing on what works
[0:44:47] MediumRareOG: That's WoW-think. "I'm not playing this game because people won't play it for 20 years"
[0:44:53] witlessplum802: Wow and runescape
[0:44:55] Thoreya: game definitely died down on twitch
[0:45:17] witlessplum802: I use to play Wow - but it was V lonely
[0:45:32] Pumba2988: im still surprised GTA5 still is as popular on twitch
[0:45:36] Thoreya: osrs is a great game if u dont have a job
[0:45:45] Pandachoww: i just cant understand hating a game and calling it shite when youve literally not played it
[0:45:55] physalis4: GTA has the online stuff keeping it going
[0:45:57] nuclearphosphate: @Pumba2988 thats cause people just sink money into GTA Online
[0:46:00] ImperfectDark: definitey, the RP for GTAV can be excellent
[0:46:14] nuclearphosphate: ive played less than 20 minutes of the game and was bored shitless
[0:46:27] Thoreya: LUL
[0:46:34] nuclearphosphate: if something doesnt grab me within an hour, i just dont have the time for it
[0:46:44] Thoreya: my coworkers stopped playing over the weekend, tryna get their $ back for a refund on steam haha
[0:47:07] MediumRareOG: Here's a good rule for life @nuclearphosphate whenever you want to say "X is shit", replace that with "X is not for me"
[0:47:09] s7wede: @nuclearphosphate Did you ever play Ark and if so, what are your thought? It's the same genre so maybe you just aren't a fan of that specific type of game.
[0:47:25] RAF_Sean: @MediumRareOG This ^
[0:47:35] nuclearphosphate: i got the full collection for FF XIV including 6 month sub, played the game for around 3 hours and hate it
[0:47:39] Pandachoww: a game being shite and you not being able to get into it are 2 very different things XD

[0:49:05] Pumba2988: What are emissary quests
[0:49:33] MediumRareOG: I preferred earning Renown in SL to DF ngl

[0:49:54] Pumba2988: Emissarys are like Callings then i only played SL and DF
[0:49:59] s7wede: I think shadowlands had the best iteration for callings / emissary quests in Season 4 where most people didn't need the anime it rewarded and could focus on the collectavist aspect of it
[0:50:11] Pumba2988: no callings
[0:50:11] Zivs: its basically Aiding the Accord but different
[0:50:16] RAF_Sean: Yeah same. I'll do them if the weekly event is 10 WQs but that's it
[0:50:25] nuclearphosphate: highest renown ive got to in DF is only 15 on the 4 major ones, and around 6 on loamm, other than that i just physically and mentally cannot grind out more
[0:50:31] MediumRareOG: Aiding the Accord doesn't give enough rep
[0:50:31] BBMezzy: They are not no. Every expansion they're reducing the amounts and sources of reputation
[0:50:40] Big_Rum: Dan did yo ualready do teh direbeak hatchling quests from Legion?
[0:50:44] LuiBMHunter: loamm is a pain to grind
[0:50:46] Thoreya: i miss bfa world quests and invasions and emissaries
[0:51:07] Pumba2988: Hope they bring something like that back to TWW ie emissary or callings
[0:51:10] MediumRareOG: I can sympathize that. I'm only max Renown because I forced myself to grind it in the 50% bonus event
[0:51:11] amricatt: I loved the emissaries.
[0:51:17] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:19] Big_Rum: So you get a the pet Direbeak Hatchling and everyday for like 20 days he gives you a adaily and at the end you get a mount
[0:51:39] JakeSezz: My BFA truther ass is waiting for the in-depth “was BFA ACTUALLY that bad, outside of azerite armor?” talk
[0:51:40] Big_Rum: Yeah
[0:51:43] MediumRareOG: Nobody does the DF world bosses (other than Aurostar)
[0:51:43] Dezzdemona417: I miss the emissaries too. I have a ton of resources left for Legion so I do them on the mobile app.
[0:51:55] nuclearphosphate: @Big_Rum is that the one that has you flying around with the javelin killing enemies or is that another daily im thinking of?

[0:52:27] amricatt: I only have one maxed out dragonflight rep.  I can't be fused to do it.
[0:52:40] Big_Rum: @nuclearphosphate A different one
[0:52:49] Pandachoww: id actually love to see them back yknow
[0:52:59] MrEvilRex: ur not the only one, im bad at spelling
[0:53:03] Pandachoww: literally....4 world quests for the factions and you done for the week
[0:53:05] JakeSezz: Cuz you’re Bri’ish, innit?! mrgmHehe
[0:53:33] nuclearphosphate: @Big_Rum i use the mobile app that has your character with gear, access to each expansion, and also allows you to do the quests that require the resources
[0:53:49] alextheblight: true
[0:53:55] Pandachoww: i dont enjoy world quests but its like a lil incentive
[0:54:02] Pandachoww: piece of gear or like a couple k gold
[0:54:31] Pandachoww: its like the wrathion stuff at the start of DF and the rare farming
[0:54:34] JakeSezz: I’m off to a meeting for an hour mrgmO mrgmHehe
[0:54:38] Big_Rum: This is the mount and how to get it if chat wants to know https://www.wowhead.com/guide/falcosaur-obtaining-falcosaur-mounts-pets-toys-4788
[0:54:55] Pandachoww: i remember one of the quests gave a DOPE tank trinket and that was a huge incentive for me
[0:55:01] BritishRaven: Those spam bots hurts my head man
[0:55:29] Pandachoww: no you can skip right up to last boss
[0:55:52] s7wede: Argent tournament has to be the worst grind ever
[0:56:14] Big_Rum: So we had a rndom snow storm last night wwe woke up to a half inch of snow... a pleasent surprise
[0:56:52] Forgiven78: Se got a solid 6 inches here.
[0:56:59] bennwolf_: have you already finished the expansions before boa?
[0:57:32] Pandachoww: who the f wears TROUSERS in the house?!
[0:57:51] Pandachoww: mat ei literally get in...shorts on
[0:58:18] PrewtaEU: shorts is BiS
[0:58:27] Zuldak: shorts are a lifestyle not fashion
[0:58:58] NeeK_23: are we getting streamer luck and the mount today chat?
[0:58:59] nuclearphosphate: @Zuldak yeah they are DEFFO not fashion :D
[0:59:03] Pumba2988: Grats on the sword. Take it easy guys
[0:59:22] s7wede: King's Rest
[0:59:24] Zuldak: Underrot and KR
[0:59:25] SNAKEBOMBS22: underrot
[0:59:27] NeeK_23: Underrot, KingsRest, Mechagon
[0:59:31] SNAKEBOMBS22: hhas a mount an kings rest
[0:59:34] Puhg: This morning my dentist said I have a cavity.  Does streamer luck prevent cavities?
[0:59:41] s7wede: Necrotik Wake from SL is soloable
[0:59:44] Big_Rum: what addon puts the checks by the dungeopns?
[1:00:02] NeeK_23: how was the Rumble btw? didnt get to catch it
[1:00:04] nuclearphosphate: @Big_Rum i use savedinstances that works very well
[1:00:23] Hotstitute: alright, ive been wrong before, so ill take that hit, or 6 in a row.... but today is 1000% SoD info
[1:00:31] Big_Rum: Loved KO losing made me laugh
[1:00:32] BritishRaven: I think it deserves a watch for sure
[1:00:46] Hotstitute: also, R-truth made that womans rumble
[1:01:01] nuclearphosphate: one of these days i MIGHT ACTUALLY get in to a server in season of discovery
[1:01:28] NeeK_23: I've been away from regularly tracking WWE for a while but I hear its coming to UK Netflix in 2025
[1:01:31] Hotstitute: oh i was trying to look this up last night... the funkadactlys... where is Cameron? is she with AEW? i havnt been able to find if she has a contract
[1:02:13] Hotstitute: its global Netflix aswell
[1:02:18] Hotstitute: no AJ tho
[1:02:26] TruVillainManny: except for the US. The WWE shows is split all over
[1:02:44] NeeK_23: this achievement sucks
[1:02:47] funviking99: so Vince Mcmahon no longer part of wwe?
[1:02:57] s7wede: @MrGM Easy fix for that WQ
[1:03:04] Big_Rum: Its so funny to see the huge difference in the women's rumble in sheer size and muscular definition. Some of them are so tiny and like they are gonna get really hurt in there
[1:03:07] s7wede: @MrGM Be in a raid group.
[1:03:22] Zivs: they die when u drag them around is the issue
[1:03:23] Hotstitute: Vince who? i heard they erased some one but i dunno who this "vince mcmahon" is.. meanwhile stephanie mcmahon is goat
[1:04:11] thunduz: hello there
[1:04:27] s7wede: you can't do it alone
[1:04:35] Zivs: used to be a thing but I think u need 5? people nowadays
[1:04:40] Big_Rum: loggin now
[1:04:41] s7wede: #s7wede2762
[1:05:09] thunduz: just sitting here hoping I have a chill week this week since last was nonstop
[1:05:28] Hotstitute: get the horde to come oblierate them
[1:05:29] BBMezzy: No problem
[1:05:30] s7wede: find 2 big groups next to each other
[1:05:32] Zivs: I think dragging them around is killing them
[1:05:32] s7wede: and be quick
[1:05:38] Layliah79: i think i ended up watching a youtube video before i did it for tips.
[1:05:43] BBMezzy: Just waiting at the dig anyway
[1:05:58] Zivs: so find a lot, aggro them with 2? maybe and then bola?
[1:06:14] Layliah79: get in a raid group so WQ doesn't complete - before you get achievement
[1:06:20] supermaduro24: @mrgm  I have questions can I still phase 1 when phase 2 come out ?
[1:06:53] supermaduro24: yes In season of discovery
[1:07:43] Layliah79: think there was a specific place that made it easier for this achievement. Dx

[1:08:34] Layliah79: got my lego questline completed yesterday morning! :D
[1:08:35] NeeK_23: nothing new for Lunar right, just  Love is in the Air
[1:08:45] physalis4: I wonder when they plan to have the dragon riding cup races come back
[1:08:51] Big_Rum: There were a couple of rces in outland cup that were a a real ball ache but i gotem all done
[1:09:03] Harai_Ulfsark: will they give me the toy or will i need to buy it again from the npc tho, i bought the manuscript and still no toy KEKWAIT
[1:09:16] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:09:34] NeeK_23: can you check you combat log for the damage
[1:09:49] Layliah79: what is the achievement called?
[1:10:01] Zuldak: the DR races are on the claendar. They are every odd month i think
[1:10:02] MediumRareOG: soft hands is a nightmare achievement
[1:10:08] breninn3: Couldn't you aggro them off mount, then mount and start hooking them?
[1:10:20] havoom01: hello  how's going what are you working on
[1:10:22] Layliah79: wowhead comment: If anyone is doing this in 2023 at level 70 and killing them too fast. I made it work by getting naked and getting rez sickness. I was weak enough not to kill them too fast.
[1:10:53] EllenorEdition: Do they take less damage if you walk on the horse rather than run?
[1:11:06] nuclearphosphate: @Layliah79 ive found that out with "old" rares or those that you have to critically weaken, if you take off all your gear, you DONT one shot them
[1:12:10] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:13:00] NeeK_23: could another hunter misdirect you and countershot to aggro them
[1:13:47] EllenorEdition: Could always do it on a character thats leveling in the BFA timeline
[1:14:30] LuiBMHunter: eek! covers his innocent eyes!
[1:14:30] Harai_Ulfsark: you can also log on another account and party sync with a low lvl character, then youre limited to lvl 61
[1:14:47] s7wede: @MrGM Here is a tip, make a naked equipment set for times like this
[1:16:11] NeeK_23: "just helping you bro"
[1:16:36] LuiBMHunter: do you have to do 5 in one go?
[1:16:53] LuiBMHunter: ohhhhh
[1:17:21] LuiBMHunter: mebbe the faster you go the more damage they take?
[1:17:24] s7wede: when you bolo them try and not be facing them because you auto attack them
[1:17:27] snagprophet: snagprophet subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 66 months! 
[1:17:45] snagprophet: hows the pc going?
[1:17:48] s7wede: so aggro 5, but don't bolo, then face away and bolo them 1 by 1
[1:18:07] NeeK_23: might need a party, one person agros one each to an area with no Kul Tiras npcs, then you tag each one
[1:18:40] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:19:03] s7wede: every time you click bolo it starts to auto attack do always face away
[1:19:40] Harai_Ulfsark: maybe a macro to use bolas and stopattack?
[1:20:24] s7wede: aggro all 5, FACE AWAY, then left click bolo, move an inch
[1:20:29] Harai_Ulfsark: the npcs stealing your troggs :(
[1:20:48] Layliah79: get naked and take rez sickness! people said it worked
[1:22:02] s7wede: don't run over them, back over them
[1:22:36] s7wede: that is why you want all 5 to be on you aggrod
[1:22:46] breninn3: Paladin, spec the taunt all in 16 yards when you bubble. Instant win
[1:23:15] s7wede: Use World Shrinka
[1:23:46] s7wede: it makes you tiny and do no damage
[1:24:11] physalis4: time to lvl engineering LUL
[1:24:29] s7wede: There is also the Whole-Body Shrinka
[1:24:34] amricatt: Holy cats.  That's so tiny.
[1:25:39] Layliah79: Agro some solo troggs (ones not fighting green NPCs) just by walking up to them. If you can't agro five, take the ones you have to some others that are not solo. Once five are next to you, use  Bolas on them one at a time. Since they are already on you, you don't need to ride over them, and they will instantly fall to the ground, roped but alive.

[1:30:33] RAF_Sean: Yeah Dan let's not get anyone canned this week ok
[1:30:41] Elrathir: Please have a bad feeling about this trading post
[1:30:44] nuclearphosphate: im not holding my breath for the reward from the post, given the last 2 or 3 have been transmogs
[1:31:15] NeeK_23: they all seemed to have a copy pasta answer

[1:32:56] RAF_Sean: I just can't imagine replacing Varya. I'm not even in the EU and I can see she is easily the best CM company wide
[1:32:57] str4ysheep: in most of EU you also can't be let go on the spot like in the US
[1:32:59] Calfast: CMs also feel like they're kinda members of the community too
[1:33:14] Calfast: Some random MS CM isn;t gonna fit the same
[1:33:26] physalis4: I don't even know who the NA community managers are, but I know who Varya is
[1:33:36] NeeK_23: lore team was hit too it seems
[1:33:36] RAF_Sean: Yeah it's like a family member losing a job
[1:33:53] RAF_Sean: I know their names but I don't know that I've seen them engage as much as V
[1:34:46] RAF_Sean: When I told Anjulee we had to pick between US and EU for her account she quickly dropped 'I much prefer Europeans to Americans'
[1:34:55] NeeK_23: Preach said it best to Linxxy, as good as an NA CM can be, they cant just pop over and meet for a meal and a chat like Varaya does
[1:35:03] RAF_Sean: On-ju-lee
[1:35:08] RAF_Sean: You were pretty close lol
[1:35:49] RAF_Sean: Just everything I hear is that she goes above and beyond
[1:36:04] SammySandbags: Good afternoon all
[1:36:13] RAF_Sean: Also can I just say I sort of miss Mechagon dailies
[1:37:54] KabalisK: Time to fight ?
[1:38:13] isillytoy: mrgmToast
[1:38:29] KabalisK: Nooooooooo
[1:38:38] nuclearphosphate: !fightwithspear
[1:38:41] NeeK_23: @RAF_Sean same..... Mechagone/Nazjatar are good memories for me
[1:38:46] nuclearphosphate: ah welp, fist it is
[1:39:09] nuclearphosphate: @RAF_Sean that was one zone i couldnt stand, the dungeon however, is one of my favourites
[1:39:39] KabalisK: outch
[1:40:06] databob1: !emote DinoDance
[1:41:26] DonMakaveli: DonMakaveli subscribed with Prime. 
[1:41:30] KabalisK: !
[1:41:57] RAF_Sean: @NeeK_23 Nazjatar can get fucked but Mechagon was good times lol
[1:42:07] RAF_Sean: @nuclearphosphate Yeah the mega dungeon is chef's kiss
[1:42:37] NeeK_23: its a 15-30 min respawn
[1:43:01] NeeK_23: afk whilst working is how I usually do it

[1:44:09] Big_Rum: Whats your cloak up to?
[1:44:27] Big_Rum: 100 sainity?
[1:45:17] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:45:39] nuclearphosphate: do you NEED the cloak for this?
[1:45:45] nuclearphosphate: JW
[1:46:02] amricatt: Hm.  I hope I saved that cloak.
[1:46:56] nuclearphosphate: how do you upgrade the cloak? ive not even been in there before
[1:47:55] MediumRareOG: With 5 masks and doing the odd crystals, chests and all areas you get 4300-4600 per clear
[1:48:24] NeeK_23: its not worth the time
[1:48:26] Arlaeya: there's an ethereal in there that you go to
[1:48:33] Big_Rum: there are crystals all over the visons that you turn into the transmog guy
[1:48:34] breninn3: Aren't they on the floor and add a debuff
[1:48:40] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:48:56] Xesol: its just a bonus loot at the end if you collect them iirc
[1:48:58] NeeK_23: they spawn in random points for a small amount of extra currency. quicker to just chain run visions
[1:49:11] Xesol: by loot i mean currency
[1:49:13] Zuldak: you can try it to see
[1:49:13] MediumRareOG: There are 10 odd crystals. Get all 10 and talk to the guy near the AH and her gives you bonus 400 corrupted
[1:49:45] Xesol: there used to be a WA to show you how many crystals and chests you had
[1:49:52] MediumRareOG: you get used to where they are. it becomes automatic
[1:50:09] NeeK_23: the bonus boss is more worth I think, usually an etherial in the tmog hut or the barbershop
[1:50:22] bennwolf_: are the visions a big grind?
[1:50:42] NeeK_23: the mount is about 100k momentos
[1:50:51] MediumRareOG: if you’re getting 1800 per run you’ll need 2.5x more coalescing visions for the vessels
[1:51:02] s7wede: They can be insane, especially if you are after the rare rewards like the mail muncher and the 100k vendor mount
[1:51:52] s7wede: summons a miniboss
[1:51:54] MediumRareOG: the echoes can be used for buying rank 3 essences for alts, which probably doesn’t matter in your case
[1:52:10] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[1:52:42] s7wede: There are 3 minibosses per scenario that you can spawn from a pool of 6
[1:52:48] s7wede: 1 per area
[1:53:01] MediumRareOG: I’m only spending the other currency because I’m grinding Uldum and Rajani anyway
[1:53:39] s7wede: Can't you get Rajanai rep from timewalking?
[1:54:10] Zuldak: i remember doing no mask runs solo in here... the most dangerous guy was rexxar who could just decide to nope your sanity
[1:54:24] s7wede: ok, I never bother to look at catchups since I always do rep grinds as current content
[1:55:19] MediumRareOG: in each area there are 4 crystal spots (3 on starting area). 2 will have crystals. it’s random
[1:56:50] s7wede: You can solo portions of it
[1:56:55] ImperfectDark: don't think Nyalotha is soloable
[1:56:59] chelfx: yes you can, the last boss you may not able too
[1:57:04] breninn3: Last boss in Ny'alotha wouldn't be soloable I dont think
[1:57:04] ndogg76: need cloak
[1:57:04] RAF_Sean: You probably can. Just need the cloak to do Nzoth
[1:57:04] MediumRareOG: you can solo LFR/normal
[1:57:12] NeeK_23: I can solo on LFR, but its a bit buggy on the phasing
[1:57:18] nuclearphosphate: im just waiting till WW to solo that stuff, i am also HOPING that when WW arrives, you dont have to do the bullshit prerequisites to get raids to appear
[1:57:19] MediumRareOG: Ra’den has a DPS check that’s tough for hunters
[1:57:32] nuclearphosphate: to get old raids to appear*
[1:58:30] s7wede: @MrGM People only remember them being tied to player power for the Artifact power or the Covenant unlocks
[1:58:33] breninn3: I really dislike feedback like that. I don't want X, I want Y, but has no suggestion on what Y could be
[1:58:33] BBMezzy: Callings were a worse emissary quest.. had to go pick it up before you could start doing WQs
[1:58:43] MediumRareOG: the bad part about callings was going to your covenant to pick them up
[1:58:50] NeeK_23: Im still waiting for the MoP cloak so I can go to Ordos on Timelees Isles
[1:59:35] s7wede: Not learning from their past mistakes is a hallmark classic WoW feature
[1:59:50] JakeSezz: Oi Oi!
[1:59:52] BBMezzy: Blizzard has this odd tendency to unlearn lessons learned (e.g. hunter's mark)
[2:00:07] MediumRareOG: my hot take is earning renown was a better experience in SL than DF
[2:00:11] nuclearphosphate: @s7wede what have they not learned from past mistakes for?
[2:00:27] JakeSezz: Not bad! Customer was actually in a good mood today so that was nice mrgmHehe
[2:00:27] Harai_Ulfsark: i forgot about hunter's mark, so many years without using it
[2:00:31] NeeK_23: I started BFA, so its inaccessible to me forever, barring some annoying pixel perfect gliding
[2:00:39] amricatt: I think hunter's mark is dumb. Why didn't they make it useful when they brought it back.
[2:01:47] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[2:01:48] NeeK_23: hunters mark is meh as a raid buff. annoying for Devastation evokers, but its very stong on Iridikron in M+ since he's always above 90%
[2:02:13] s7wede: @nuclearphosphate I was specifically talking about the progression of player power being tied to daily quests in Legion - BFA - Shadowlands. Dragonflight has thankfully shown some growth, but it took took 3 doing the same failed idea 3 times before they pulled that ripcord
[2:02:14] Shrandamar: Shrandamar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:02:38] nuclearphosphate: @s7wede ah, gotcha :)
[2:03:11] MediumRareOG: iirc you accidentally did it in heroic last week
[2:03:14] s7wede: March
[2:03:18] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[2:03:20] NeeK_23: not wanting to get into a whole thing, but what player power was tied to Anima in SL? It was purely cosmetics
[2:03:25] nuclearphosphate: probably summer 2024 for PP
[2:03:44] s7wede: At the start it was covenant unlocks
[2:03:49] ScaryLarryGames: nada man just chillin
[2:04:05] tiyanigean: @NeeK_23 the 1k anima weekly raised your covenant level which unlocke dstuff for your soulbinds
[2:04:05] dright424: you needed to get the anima weekly for the renown progression which was power tied
[2:04:26] s7wede: Renown was Covenant unlocks
[2:04:31] physalis4: I remember grinding sooo much anima
[2:04:42] MediumRareOG: renown unlocked soulbind conduits
[2:04:57] flabo: i dread the moment I'll go to complete torghast
[2:04:59] BBMezzy: 73k currency to go until I can tell the archives to get bent HahaSweat
[2:04:59] physalis4: After they "pulled the ripcord" I grinded so much xmog
[2:05:18] s7wede: People forget that, because season 4 was fucking amazing and you got some much anima thrown at you and could change covenants on the fly
[2:05:53] MediumRareOG: 9.1.5 removed covenant change penalty
[2:05:53] ImperfectDark: Zereth Mortis is decent for farming anima with treasures and rares
[2:06:12] physalis4: ZM was chill
[2:06:13] ImperfectDark: definitely way better, especially once you unlock flying
[2:06:23] tallgrass: It didnt matter in the .1 patch when they initially became swappable, because they also introduced domination sockets with  that patch which were the most awful gearing decision they ever made
[2:06:30] s7wede: If you engaged with protoform synthesis, it was a collectivists dream
[2:06:37] MediumRareOG: I preferred rare hunting in ZM to any DF zone
[2:06:40] thegreataspect: Korthia was the city of secretes that wasn't a city and had no secretes
[2:06:41] JakeSezz: Do y’all know if they opened up Zaralek or Forbidden Reach to quest/level up in?
[2:06:47] nuclearphosphate: zerith mortis is yet another zone im not a fan of
[2:07:22] Elrathir: Korthia, the city of misnomers
[2:07:34] JakeSezz: Yeah I didn’t think so either. was completing the Storm Race Course on my 67 Warrior and was curious after flying around those zones
[2:07:39] NeeK_23: honestly, I never really vibed with ZM, i felt it needed more. even as an endgame rare hunt zone it was dull and sparse

[2:26:37] NeeK_23: its just the quests to get points .I think theyre always there but are date locked. not new items
[2:26:45] icer301: what the reward for having completed the trading post for 12 months?

[2:29:08] MachoCham: I think the good thing is there isn't a wrong choice with class/race/spec
[2:29:10] NeeK_23: some weird people even like monks
[2:29:12] MachoCham: Everything is viable
[2:29:14] MCGWEST: have you watched battle swrod art online animation
[2:29:32] MediumRareOG: some people like hunters. other people are wrong. everyone is different
[2:29:36] nuclearphosphate: @funviking99 if youve not played in over 6 months, you get the option to boost your gear slightly, wipe your questlog (or keep them) and give you new bags
[2:29:50] MCGWEST: its like wow, but real life, they get sinced into the game their mind, theyre like in the world
[2:29:54] MachoCham: I'd say join something like the Dojo community and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. We have had a couple of new players start and help them along their journey
[2:29:54] nuclearphosphate: @MediumRareOG hunters arent the best tho

[2:55:16] NeeK_23: fyi it wasnt bugged, thats the mechanic
[2:55:29] HydraKings: You ask if someone wants a coke, then you specify whether or not they want a certain brand.
[2:55:34] thunduz: @missildineonline facts!
[2:55:41] chelfx: we do say ill have 2 cokes or pepsi but the drink itself we call pop or sode

[3:05:55] Jack_the_Dipper: You signed up for AV1 beta streaming on Twitch?
[3:06:16] MachoCham: AV1?
[3:06:33] adampanerabread: yo!
[3:06:47] adampanerabread: so ready
[3:07:03] MachoCham: PTR has been dead for a while now
[3:07:11] Jack_the_Dipper: AV1 is a open-source video code. Same quality for less data or higher quality for same data
[3:07:20] Jack_the_Dipper: Video codec
[3:07:44] MachoCham: 8k
[3:08:05] MachoCham: 1080 maybe
[3:08:13] MachoCham: Anything above that; not really for wow
[3:08:19] Jack_the_Dipper: 1440p yes but higher.... Not that a lot
[3:08:25] ImperfectDark: i don't think so, tbh. I feel like 1080 will always capture more of the audience
[3:08:27] breninn3: If I'm watching on my phone or iPad I'm always watching at the highest quality possible
[3:08:29] MediumRareOG: 1080p60, yes. nothing higher
[3:08:35] breninn3: 1440p would be ideal
[3:08:37] Jack_the_Dipper: More gamers have 1440p monitors these days
[3:08:44] kazzjenkins: 1440 would be cool
[3:08:47] ImperfectDark: i'
[3:09:03] MachoCham: I don't think anyone would notice
[3:09:10] MachoCham: and even fewer would care
[3:09:15] breninn3: Plus, most leave it on auto so wouldn't they just throttle down if 1440p would be too much
[3:09:27] MediumRareOG: btw 2K is 1080p
[3:09:41] chelfx: 2k is 1440
[3:09:41] AdamShwaginz: morning gamers :)
[3:09:43] chelfx: i thoguht
[3:09:46] breninn3: 2k is 1440p
[3:09:51] Jack_the_Dipper: Yeah 2k is 1440
[3:09:51] Fennithos: 2k is 1440p
[3:09:54] JunkyardQuokka: 1440 is closer to 2.5k
[3:09:57] breninn3: 720 is HD, 2xHD = 1440
[3:10:25] chelfx: oh so 2K resolution is 2048 x 1080
[3:10:29] Jack_the_Dipper: It is confusing all those resolutions
[3:10:34] MachoCham: Would it help if I think everyone is getting far too hung up on the minute details here
[3:10:50] MediumRareOG: 4K is named after the horizontal pixels. 3840x2160. 2k is half that. 1920x1080 ie 1080p
[3:10:56] chelfx: but i guess 1440p is marketed as 2k
[3:11:05] chelfx: so its confusing
[3:11:28] JunkyardQuokka: hence why 1440p is closer to 2.5k
[3:11:33] MachoCham: I will put this in the pile of things I care about alongside Love Island and Minecraft
[3:12:05] chelfx: sucha great cut scene

[3:14:08] MediumRareOG: iirc battle of dazralor had a quest. not sure about siege
[3:14:18] AdamShwaginz: low key nostalgic for BFA not for the content in the expansion, but because I actually had time to play wow back then lol
[3:15:13] NeeK_23: it followed Legion and people were mega hyped for that still
[3:15:14] AdamShwaginz: I definitely was very into the lore back then
[3:15:15] CeasiusPls: bfa was before 2020, we didn't know how bad it could get
[3:15:16] MachoCham: Shwagz <3
[3:15:22] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:15:23] Hoazalf: most people play casually I feel
[3:15:35] michaelmm: BFA was rough for raid logging and high end content. I think it was pretty decent otherwise.
[3:15:53] MachoCham: I swear some people thing that shitting on Shadowlands is a personality trait
[3:16:01] Xesol: absolutely
[3:16:07] Hoazalf: for sure!
[3:16:10] Fennithos: Yes, true
[3:16:14] NeeK_23: just look at the numbers of people who voted for the season 4 tier sets. on average about 5k people each
[3:16:14] MediumRareOG: 90% of players don’t do each of M+, pvp and raiding
[3:16:24] Arlaeya: yes. M+ is scary if you don't have people to do them with.
[3:16:24] catteryn: yes, I think so
[3:16:48] michaelmm: Yeah the only reliable public data about player numbers is raid/M+ info from the armory.
[3:17:01] michaelmm: Open world player numbers is a mystery.
[3:17:04] Jack_the_Dipper: Would there be a beter indicator to find out the numbers?
[3:17:36] michaelmm: There are websites that gather data from the auction house, but even that's incomplete.
[3:17:47] NeeK_23: I only assume that only Blizz knows based on active accounts logging in regularly
[3:17:47] Jack_the_Dipper: Oh yeah I know but maybe you would think of something different
[3:18:05] AdamShwaginz: he only really mentions that stuff to show the health of M+ or raids during whichever season
[3:18:23] michaelmm: Ion has heavily hinted that open world players are by fat the majority.
[3:18:23] MediumRareOG: Microsoft could earn some good karma by merging NA and EU
[3:18:40] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:18:55] CeasiusPls: It's not a fully random sample, but if you can see a decrease/increase in completion over time, that still gives us valuable info
[3:18:56] MachoCham: I swear I saw some stats from Jordan today that I can't find now but it was something along the lines that data from Raider.io that 3.2 Mythic Plus' are timed every second
[3:19:13] Hoazalf: I mean yeah it's the most accessible
[3:19:39] michaelmm: I'd wager a lot of open world players only do LFR once to compete the campaign quest.
[3:20:12] MediumRareOG: remember SL season 4 where there was nothing for open world players?
[3:20:26] MediumRareOG: other than dated WBs
[3:20:47] CeasiusPls: I actually I think there are other ways to gather stats, our WoW armory pages are open to the public and you can see if you completed M+ and raids including LFR
[3:21:05] NeeK_23: what do you mean? we're getting our own pirate ships
[3:21:18] Phenroi: pile of kelp is the loot
[3:21:21] michaelmm: AIUI they plan to just do Ilvl increases for S4. 10.2.6 and 10.2.7 are probably gonna do the heavily lifting content wise.
[3:21:22] Wextak: its on the ground
[3:21:29] MediumRareOG: they bumped ilvl for rifts, dream surges, feasts, etc in 10.2, which I appreciate
[3:21:36] NeeK_23: Mike Ybarra said no pirates, but he's gone now so its 24/7 pirates from now on
[3:21:52] Jack_the_Dipper: You have to rank the last 4 expansions, how would you rank them from 4 to 1
[3:22:17] Jack_the_Dipper: Yes
[3:22:31] MediumRareOG: legion ended well but started horribly
[3:22:48] Jack_the_Dipper: Hmm interesting
[3:22:53] michaelmm: For me Legion>Dragonflight=BfA>Shadowlands.
[3:22:53] MachoCham: I don't mind the relevancy stuff and bumping iLevel but the fact that stuff isn't soloable now is still annoying me
[3:23:00] NeeK_23: objectively or personally, both would be different answers for me
[3:23:00] MediumRareOG: people forget how had 7.0/7.1 was
[3:23:30] AdamShwaginz: DF of Legion? friendship over.
[3:23:35] AdamShwaginz: over*
[3:23:46] flabo: early legion legendaries/artifacts was on par if not worse than covenants
[3:23:55] funviking99: I like legion story more than others but df is no 1 in context of systems
[3:24:02] MediumRareOG: BFA was so horrible for off spec and alts
[3:24:03] flabo: but we didn't have to wait so long for them to pull the cord
[3:24:07] NeeK_23: SL wasnt good, but I had so much fun in 9.0 personally that its hard to write it off as bad
[3:24:07] MachoCham: Rose tinted glasses
[3:24:12] michaelmm: It's hard for my memories of the Suramar Storyline and Argus to be beat by Df.
[3:24:14] breninn3: I loved BfA, my first experience of actually progressing in Mythic
[3:24:39] MachoCham: I don't really care about the story; I enjoyed a lot of SL elements
[3:24:44] CeasiusPls: Story for me is Legion over DF but gameplay is DF over Legion
[3:25:04] flabo: also the timegate during broken shore campaign, log in, kill 3 rares, log off, wait a week
[3:25:08] michaelmm: I started Legion midway through after they removed the timegatng. I probably experiences the best version of Suramar.
[3:26:03] admok: I think it's really good right now :)
[3:26:14] JunkyardQuokka: loved the story of legion but not been able to play my DH due to not getting the correct lego killed it for me.
[3:26:19] ScaryLarryGames: DF is really well done
[3:26:32] Arlaeya: I've loved DF all the way through
[3:26:33] Iwony: I certainly thing they overdid it with the Cobalt Assembly grind.
[3:26:38] Iwony: think
[3:26:46] NeeK_23: pet i think
[3:26:55] Cyberventurer: DF started out okay for me but the story lost me relatively early on, and never pulled up for me.
[3:27:33] NeeK_23: discounting is just giving away money
[3:27:49] MediumRareOG: in 7.0 people rerolled when they got the wrong legendary randomly
[3:28:42] ShineyFighter: silly. sporkyLOL
[3:28:48] ShineyFighter: mrgmHehe mrgmHehe mrgmHehe mrgmHehe
[3:29:15] MediumRareOG: to do what?
[3:29:23] Arlaeya: @Iwony Part of this could be better if they made the items BoA

[3:32:20] thunduz: Nazjatar world PvP was amazing
[3:32:22] MediumRareOG: nazjtar isn't really RNG. it's just a grind. like the weekly boss, you choose which to summon
[3:33:06] MediumRareOG: yeah, the guy in cave takes 11-12 weeks. the nechmen take 90 days of dailies
[3:33:21] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove

[3:34:55] lindlyn: lindlyn subscribed at Tier 1.

[3:37:54] Ragnaros_Lothbrok: @MrGM Are we gonna get a ''this week in wow'' post today ?

[3:38:14] lindlyn: no
[3:38:32] Shalyndoa: hello 👋🏽
[3:38:35] karklop: Yes, 3 dailies
[3:38:37] ScaryLarryGames: National eat McDonalds day
[3:38:47] thunduz: no holidays for a while
[3:38:47] magemaster225: Groundhog day friday
[3:38:53] karklop: You pick one of them every day and do their dailies
[3:38:56] Shocklate_: Yo
[3:38:59] MediumRareOG: you choose one and do the dailies with them
[3:39:03] Vattss: pizza day
[3:39:03] Septikknissen: If its account wide, you can do it in 30, if you do each follower with different characters
[3:39:48] zantos2020: Groundhog day is the day Punksatoney Phil (beaver) comes out of his hole and if he sees his shadow then there are 10 more weeks of winter
[3:40:19] magemaster225: Yeah
[3:40:20] zantos2020: yep, it's a real thing
[3:40:22] icer301: yeah
[3:40:23] lindlyn: yes
[3:40:23] Layliah79: YES!
[3:40:27] Jack_the_Dipper: Twelvetyone
[3:40:32] Xesol: yea its kind of like a joke though
[3:40:41] magemaster225: Protip, the groundhog always lies
[3:40:42] MediumRareOG: groundhog day, such a great movie
[3:40:46] Vorryk: Punks-uh-tawny is the town pronounciation
[3:41:02] thunduz: groundhogs day? yeah that’s legit lol
[3:41:08] Septikknissen: According to wowhead comments, it is account wide, since 8.3
[3:41:17] MediumRareOG: you know what they say about groundhogs? they taste like chicken
[3:41:37] Shocklate_: like a beaver without a flat tail
[3:41:39] Xesol: its like a beaver kind of
[3:41:39] icer301: but it's been 4 or 5 since it started, groundhoggs don't live forever
[3:41:45] Layliah79: PETA wants them to stop with Groundhog's day
[3:41:52] Etaranel: They're the size of a cat
[3:42:12] Septikknissen: Max for one character ye, but if its on different factions, it won't work
[3:42:25] MediumRareOG: if you're legvelling the henchmen you'll get the rep as a side effect
[3:42:30] icer301: why you walking
[3:42:37] dastago: i think cows actually account for most animal deaths in the uk per year lol
[3:43:01] MediumRareOG: it might be account wide for same faction? (guessing)
[3:43:07] Iwony: no rep is account wide , only maybe the benefits
[3:43:25] Septikknissen: The achievment for max follower rep is
[3:44:12] Septikknissen: 90 days if you do all 3 on one character
[3:44:13] zantos2020: haha WTF,  deer are responsible for more deaths than any other animal in the USA.
[3:44:19] Septikknissen: So 30 days per
[3:44:30] karklop: 30 days per follower
[3:44:31] MediumRareOG: 3 henchmen, 30 levels each, 3x29 technically
[3:44:33] Xesol: yea people hit them with their cars constantly
[3:44:36] karklop: 90 in total
[3:44:47] breninn3: Cows are just huge, easily squash you.
[3:45:06] magemaster225: Hit a deer on the 4th of July cause they were getting spooked by the fireworks
[3:45:31] zantos2020: Are there rodeos in the UK? Do cowboys ride bulls?
[3:45:46] Vattss: 3 dailys a day yes
[3:45:55] MediumRareOG: iirc there are tokens that drop that give follower xp so it might not take 30 days
[3:45:59] karklop: I love these patch meta achievements, I always feel so accomplished when I finish them
[3:46:22] icer301: if haggus was popular in the us, deer would be the preferred meat as it is for sheep in scotland
[3:46:26] karklop: And the mount rewards were always so cool

[3:49:56] Vattss: baby goat
[3:50:07] dastago: i'm not a vegetarian but it always feels too fucked up to me to eat lamb

[3:50:25] catteryn: kid?
[3:50:51] MediumRareOG: There's a Simpsons episode where Lisa asks "what's the difference between the lamb in the petting zoo and this cooked one?" and Bart replied "this one spent 2 hours in the broiler"
[3:51:22] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:51:26] MediumRareOG: I got the Soundless mount last week, so happy about that. it sucks to farm
[3:51:29] breninn3: Well a baby goat is a kid, so kid meat... that's enough to get you on a list LUL

[3:52:23] chelfx: I've been watching a channel called Outdoor boys, it's a guy who does outdoor survival videos in Alaska
[3:52:45] zantos2020: Outdoor Boys is great, I love that channel
[3:52:52] thunduz: it’s been so long since I’ve watched the flintstones movie

[3:53:14] breninn3: I watched a bunch of VICE videos about money mules/money laundering. They don't get enough credit for some of the stuff they produce
[3:55:26] chelfx: @Elkhuntsman it's a political shit storm
[3:55:37] MediumRareOG: the southern border isn't really in crisis. it's completely hyped up for news ratings. and it's a political football
[3:56:13] Stormcrone: critical thinking skills are needed more than ever these days
[3:56:23] Arlaeya: now this is the Suramar intro
[3:56:42] Arlaeya: OH wait no sorry... purple
[3:56:47] MediumRareOG: most undocumented immigrants are visa overstayers, not coming across the southern border
[3:56:47] breninn3: It's like the channel crossing in the UK, it's blown way out of proportion, and could really be helped by governments making avenues of legal immigration/seeking asylum easier.   If you can't claim asylum easily without being in the country then what else do you expect than people trying every avenue to get here
[3:57:01] MediumRareOG: the economy would collapse without undocumented migrants, particularly agriculture
[3:57:02] Arlaeya: too much purple, looked like suramar for a sec lol
[3:57:23] chelfx: Warbringers was BFA
[3:57:46] zantos2020: How about them Chiefs?
[3:58:02] MediumRareOG: The UK government has gone crazy with restricting legal immigration. Like it costs 10,000 pounds for a spouse visa once you add up all the fees

[3:58:27] MediumRareOG: Detroit really did shit the bed, like worse than the Cowboys
[3:58:36] Vesamora: added side drama of football bros being mad about taylor swift being involved
[3:58:46] lyreilla: They now go to the Superbowl. Was rooting for the Lions but they botched it.
[3:58:51] Xesol: ya shes dating the chiefs tight end
[3:58:54] Layliah79: Taylor yelled at the camera when they did, to stop doing it
[3:58:56] Akela3: yes...repeatedly
[3:59:01] zantos2020: tswift was there, she had her own booth
[3:59:01] lyreilla: T Swift dates one of the Players on the Chiefs

[3:59:04] Mazerbeam: Anytime Kelce does something they cut to Taylor
[3:59:06] plopptart: yes and that's the issue ppl have... it's non stop
[3:59:08] magemaster225: They cut to her like 2-3 times a game
[3:59:09] Xesol: just for ratings lol

[3:59:14] lindlyn: ratings
[3:59:15] lyreilla: So they have gotten a lot of attention lol

[3:59:15] JakeSezz: Tight End: not a euphemism I. the NFL
[3:59:16] Layliah79: She just wants to be normal and watch the game.
[3:59:18] breninn3: 49ers win the super bowl?
[3:59:19] Akela3: yeah ratings
[3:59:20] jimmymidjinnilsson: Hi, do you collect battle pets?
[3:59:33] Layliah79: she's HUGE here
[3:59:38] Vesamora: to the point that football bros are tweeting about taylor dating him for his super bowl money because they're stupid and don't realize she's like 10 times more wealthy than him
[3:59:42] Mazerbeam: She's the biggest name in music right now
[3:59:51] zantos2020: she is the highest paid entertainer in the US
[3:59:58] Layliah79: Chiefs game viewership went up once she started dating him.
[3:59:59] breninn3: I work with some die hard swifties, they're intense!
[4:00:08] MediumRareOG: Taylor Swift is a legit billionaire now
[4:00:24] JakeSezz: People calling her a gold digger on Twitter when she’s worth over a billi mrgmO mrgmHehe
[4:00:38] Layliah79: she's a brilliant artist!
[4:00:50] Xesol: it brought in a whole demographic of fans who didnt watch football prior
[4:00:55] Mazerbeam: She had to re-record all of her albums because her recording and publisher screwed her over
[4:00:58] catteryn: people pay hundreds to go see her
[4:01:00] Mazerbeam: shes printing money now
[4:01:02] lindlyn: there merch is selling out because of her
[4:01:14] Layliah79: she kissed him live on the air after the game was over - they made sure to cover that on tv
[4:01:15] JakeSezz: Yeah I think she cleared a billi during this tour
[4:01:40] MediumRareOG: The Chiefs QB got a $500 million 10 year contract so I think he's OK
[4:01:45] chelfx: Taylor Swift did a post on people to get registered to vote and  about 350k people registered
[4:01:50] lindlyn: good question
[4:01:53] ScaryLarryGames: So weird that the NFL ratings where in the shitters and then all these famous chicks start dating and showing up at football games
[4:01:56] zantos2020: If they break up then she'll have a lot more songs to write lol
[4:02:03] Xesol: i read something that said having her at the games over the past few months generated 331 million for the nfl
[4:02:10] lyreilla: Then the Chiefs don't matter anymore when they break up, lol
[4:02:13] plopptart: they have merch that just says "go Taylor's boyfriend" in the chiefs colors and his number
[4:02:16] magemaster225: The breakup tracks she'll make will be all time chart toppers
[4:02:18] lyreilla: Eminem was at Lions

[4:02:38] MediumRareOG: The Superbowl is coming up. Chiefs, 49ers
[4:02:40] Mazerbeam: He's from Detroit
[4:02:40] plopptart: Detroit
[4:02:42] Layliah79: Detroit LIONs... DETROIT
[4:02:45] wastedxtime93: Detroit lmao
[4:02:46] Xesol: eminem is a big detroit fan
[4:02:53] JakeSezz: Detroit Lions-Eminem is from DET
[4:03:00] Layliah79: Lions were kicking butt in the 1st half, then they blew the game in the 2nd half. Sad
[4:03:07] zantos2020: I think it started when somebody posted a pic of Kelce at a tswift concert, so he invited her to watch him in the superbowl last year
[4:03:13] MediumRareOG: The Lions making it this far is crazy because they've sucked for years
[4:03:14] Akela3: which player is eminem dating? Kappa
[4:03:17] chelfx: 20 minutes
[4:03:25] Layliah79: Lions have NEVER been to a Super Bowl
