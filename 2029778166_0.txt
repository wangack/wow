I recently started playing Unholy and with the amount of micro-CCs, I find it so hard to press all the buttons needed for ramp up in 3s opener.

[5:53:30] ImHomegr0wn: the auto config looks nice though
[5:54:09] ImHomegr0wn: from what EposVox was saying, it sounded like they didn't want to just flip the switch and turn it on but instead see how it's going to work
[5:54:18] krome2dadome: transcoding > ciscoding
[5:54:22] ImHomegr0wn: watched his like 17 min video on it earlier
[5:54:43] ImHomegr0wn: I think he was saying they want to be the better streaming platform
[5:55:03] ImHomegr0wn: yeah so I wonder if they do pause and rewind like youtube has too
[5:55:13] meliodas_2506: i really enjoy watching playing udk , i learn a lot, tysm :)
[5:55:15] ImHomegr0wn: yep
[5:55:46] ImHomegr0wn: and up to 5 different encoding settings being able to be sent out per streamer
[5:56:51] ImHomegr0wn: yeah
[5:58:13] Pwnyo808: Wasn't this one of twitches better years?
[5:58:15] ImHomegr0wn: maybe they think more people will be able to watch longer on different devices options? considering someone on mobile with data caps can choose to watch in a low bitrate option. something that you couldn't chooose to do on any stream
[5:58:25] Pwnyo808: Rev
[5:59:04] ReallyHigh714: Do pvp enchants scale? Like if you buy the cheap ones do they improve once inside arenas?
[5:59:25] Pwnyo808: Ah that could be.
[6:01:29] Pwnyo808: Right, I don't necessarily think the firing is a "bad" sign, just that it's not as nuts as covid
[6:02:27] Pwnyo808: Business as a whole right now in most industries is "suffering" but because they have to lay off the increased staff to deal with the volumes
[6:03:54] Pwnyo808: No they can't do that.  You need to suck resources from competitors
[6:12:27] ImHomegr0wn: maybe they want everyone on the auto config eventually that they'll tune to bandwidth costs
[6:13:08] ImHomegr0wn: auto config does seem nice for people that just want to go live. I know things like SL OBS exist but this does more than that'
[6:13:12] ImHomegr0wn: yeah
[6:13:33] ImHomegr0wn: yep
[6:13:35] al_capow: in theory you can also save costs by increasing stream latency as well

[6:16:53] avenueone: 1st day when mes did it tho

[6:18:06] atoker: there's a ton of people with 0 viewers using bandwidth
[6:18:16] al_capow: they need incentive for people to start though, imo it would make more sense for them to moonlight as a video host platform

[9:49:14] eMBeaR64oz: I meant that outlaw doesnt have a cdr on vanish anymore, so im confused how he vanished so much, even if some of those were nelf to stealth, so im confused how he vanished so much
[9:49:52] archtme: what do you mean? Outlaw has cdr on vanish on every finisher, and even more with the correct rolls
[9:50:00] JsonABL: Restless Blades for outlaw has cd on vanish
[9:50:15] JsonABL: It's a passive, don't even need to spec it

[9:53:03] archtme: it's not a spell
[9:54:29] atoker: @blaanke do you have a main? if so send honor and buy all the world pvp gear then convert that to tier, just spend conquest on trophies for rings and get trinkets. Buying the world pvp weapon is good on DKs, because you don't have to waste gold on 2 sophic devotions, because you have runic enchants
[9:55:22] archtme: are zombies actually good?
[9:55:37] happyheals: i started gearing that yesterday
[9:55:43] happyheals: have 5 greens still lol
[9:56:26] atoker: @archtme zombies can be about 8% to 12% of your damage if you place them well, but they put people on stun dr
[9:57:09] atoker: they also waste runic power which you need for coils, and coil without zombies is roughly 20% of your damage

[9:59:44] atoker: @archtme if the enemies stack up together (like if you're facing a resto shaman team) then the zombies can stun all three targets during your blind go and they can be good
[10:00:02] archtme: Ah ok ty!
[10:03:06] atoker: @archtme if they made zombies a runic power generator, instead of a spender like before then I would always use them

[10:08:36] happyheals: yeah i have a shuffle build
[10:08:39] happyheals: ill change spec
