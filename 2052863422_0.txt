[1:16:34] Conqmoh: @danbalanceltrist OMEGALUL

[1:17:34] don_ben_yo: We will still do BFD every ID, still missing 17 Staffs xD
[1:17:36] chr47: all my casual friends did it 1/2 times and just are waiting for p2
[1:17:41] iwluf: I did bfd like 3-4 times
[1:17:50] xmadj: i'm a dad gamer and i confirm
[1:17:52] FareweII_: wow's audience in general is old as fuck, it's a boomer game
[1:17:53] spectral2702: bfd raid seems boring af
[1:18:05] Peilo241: game should never be designed around neets
[1:18:12] danbalanceltrist: maybe people should stop expecting to clear all the content with minimum effort?
[1:18:46] xmadj: levelling is the best part
[1:18:46] YzieGG: its only a few weeks old and zoomer cant wait ICANT
[1:18:52] gjenden: What u maining in p2 potato?
[1:19:23] Drazimo: It's not an end game raid, it's a filler.

[1:19:26] FriggiName: i mean, for lv60, classic also exactly that, difference is, this is not 60 content, yet

[1:20:34] IlliosTV: I mean, they have to make Lvl 60 Raids harder... Items now have more stats than MC Loot xD
[1:20:34] cewewy: why you look like more chonk
[1:20:35] xmadj: classic is not a hard game by design, it rewards you for the time you play not for your skills
[1:20:40] danbalanceltrist: its common sense to make a level 25 raid accesible to everyone so they dont quit on their way to 60
[1:20:43] sondena: So who would think Classic rading would be hard
[1:20:46] pengwin06: when everyone is 60, will there be a reason to run alts thru bfd and gnomer raids?
[1:20:57] zmario93: is 200 gold enough for p2?
[1:21:02] IlliosTV: The fucking 2h from Gnome has double the strength of Sulfuras
[1:21:16] its_mike: technically BFD isn't even a raid
[1:21:17] varkshot: No classic raiding is hard
[1:21:21] sobalaka: DUST TO DUST

[8:10:33] nutmeg419: SOD boomy is super easy

[8:20:00] Dehumanizer86: nope, aimed shot is capped at 2.8 and multi is capped at 2.5. happened way back. called attack power normalization. only auto shot gets the full attack power.
[8:20:01] zzymba: can you show ur talents, thanks
[8:20:07] MaZe5: SoD BWL PogT
[8:20:16] boomstick093: Why is it everyone thinks we even get the old raids released ? :D
[8:20:16] kyousuki21: what do you think hunter will be at on the next phase on melee ranking @jokerdtv
[8:20:32] theawesomestshow: since they are changing the dungeon gears at 40 you think well get changes to the 60 raid gear
[8:20:33] cfuihji: HUHA
[8:20:33] noodlepal: ICANTMalta SHOT
[8:20:39] ritter184: Full AP but still weapon dmg
[8:20:41] stuffe92: @dehumanizer86 nice info
[8:21:00] stuffe92: then 2,8 is Max u want in pve ?
[8:21:10] veiloflonelystars: we are likely geting the eason of mastery 60 verisons aswell
[8:21:11] zzymba: Are you current on MM talents?
[8:21:18] aoe_enjoyer: If im leveling warrior do i have to spam dm till i get smites
[8:21:21] Schrock: If I'm a kid brother that can't get enough attention, should I roll druid and sit in hillsbrad?
[8:21:29] theawesomestshow: Do you think they will adjust the 60 raid gear like they are at 40? to tune better for sod
[8:21:43] nordic_endzeitparty: KEKL
[8:21:44] butterzugzug: @Dehumanizer86 but doesn't negate the fact, that you want to have a wepon with over 3s after all attackspeed thingys to don't clip autoshots while casting aimed shot
[8:21:45] Dehumanizer86: if anybody wants to read up  on it https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization
[8:21:52] theawesomestshow: they adjusted alot of the 40 gear. they adjusted the stats and added spellpower
[8:21:54] monkatos_andy: Sadge
[8:22:00] kransk: Sadge
[8:22:02] rizz_ich: and spent 0 mana for all of it

[8:22:15] dizernut: sage
[8:22:16] stuffe92: 500 insta spell crit
[8:22:19] Zyrax11: blizzard balance KEKG
[8:22:33] veiloflonelystars: @theawesomestshow casters needed it tbh at 40 theres not much sp gear and also they lost stamina so its fair
[8:22:48] veiloflonelystars: its pvp offhand 21stam is huge dude
[8:22:51] Dehumanizer86: @butterzugzug of course, at least back then, over 50% of your damage was auto shots so a slower weapon was always preferable
[8:22:56] einself111: finally with balance druid the worst payers in the game can win pvp fights ICANT
[8:22:58] Thrively: I wish the end cath SM gear was not healer only
[8:23:04] veiloflonelystars: oh its int
[8:23:06] veiloflonelystars: sucks then
[8:23:14] Azibex: PogOJam
[8:23:25] Azibex: yap PogOff
[8:23:34] butterzugzug: @butterzugzug yeah, i don't think that the runes are going to change that so slow weapon will be priorised over enddmg
[8:23:38] veiloflonelystars: they have been cautions with the gear scalling, doubt they will make it better than zg gear wise at 50
[8:23:51] butterzugzug: @butterzugzug within in the same itemlvlrange
[8:24:00] Pudgypantss: no one is going to run cath now KEKL
[8:24:03] staal__: healer gear xd
[8:24:23] veiloflonelystars: stats are still low, its the green texts that are good
[8:24:30] swedishviking345: they destroy vanilla with this gear inflation

[8:24:45] DonAndolini: "destroy vanilla" KEKW
[8:24:49] realstickybluntz: I hope they re make Kara and not just scale down the raid and gear
[8:24:53] tyreh1: form one UltraMad

[8:25:29] Spanos_: all I could think is they don’t want lock tanks using it
[8:25:31] veiloflonelystars: @realstickybluntz i would love bc kara at 60 but 20man and also have the other new part the crypts
[8:25:31] victorioustheviking: Listening
[8:25:33] snoopy239: They're probably getting minus stamina because one of the bosses probably focuses the person with the most HP @JokerdTV
[8:25:33] monkatos_andy: @Streamlabs Omegakek
[8:25:42] veiloflonelystars: i hope its both just 2 diferent PARTS
[8:25:53] gaming5150: No changes ReallyMad
[8:25:53] veiloflonelystars: and new mechanics and tunned ye for 20 man
[8:25:58] loudriantv: current kharazhan cant fit 40 people
[8:26:01] loudriantv: they have to adjust
[8:26:19] neugassh: just close this shitty sod and make a proper classic+
[8:26:30] veiloflonelystars: 20 man at most
[8:26:38] loudriantv: do y think they gonna give new raid after naxx ?
[8:27:02] monkatos_andy: Listening
[8:27:02] bluesector_: 40 man is an instant quit
[8:27:07] sweetnonsensse: Im excited :)
[8:27:08] Snapshotbg: why not changing the formats - we have better gear. Maybe 15 man instead of 20, and 30 instead of 40
[8:27:20] zkovgaard1: Karazhan they teased already right?
[8:27:31] cosmicoriginz: At 60 there will be phases like when Classic launched
[8:27:39] DozzeL: nothing will be better than naxx tho PogO
[8:27:41] aoe_enjoyer: It should be called years of discovery not seasons
[8:27:42] zkovgaard1: scarlet monastery will be p3 raid
[8:27:47] veiloflonelystars: scarlet monastery will be lvl50 raid
[8:27:47] loudriantv: ^
[8:27:48] bimyouX: they neverteased SM
[8:27:49] ritter184: Scarlet enclave
[8:28:00] realstickybluntz: could have phases even after 60 as wel
[8:28:07] bluesector_: in a 40 man raid, you are carrying 10 people and 5 are afk. It takes 1h to form and 2 hour to run anything. 6 week streak without getting loot - nightmare of vanilla
[8:28:08] Saiauriel: Bigdiqbandit KEKInsane
[8:28:08] cosmicoriginz: Only MC and Ony will be out at 60
[8:28:12] Psico_420: @bimyouX they did on SoD announcement

[8:28:55] DonAndolini: ofc KKona
[8:28:59] Deathu: no i think they should add tokens for most items where you can at least get an item per 2-3 weeks @JokerdTV
[8:29:01] mazian4: @JokerdTV How many items drop from the bosses in molten core?
[8:29:07] JoeHiden: @JokerdTV wrong
[8:29:22] cosmicoriginz: @JoeHiden you are wrong shush
[8:29:29] bluesector_: Yea ofc, this automatically means I want erverything after 1 week. Streamer with benefits will never understand because they will just do shameless runs

[8:29:49] JoeHiden: @cosmicoriginz u still cant bfd dont ever ping me again cretin
[8:29:51] Deathu: the reason why gdkp was so massive is because like your chance to get an item in normal pug is like so low vs gdkp you jsut swipe @JokerdTV

[8:30:12] goolly_7177: how do we feel about MM against BM Hunter?
[8:30:18] Pudgypantss: First
[8:30:35] chr47: 40 man raids with your guild are a very unique experience
[8:30:43] calzenn: survival gonna be nuts
[8:30:57] smander: MM wins in a fight assuming ur both starting equal b/c u trap/fear pets and so now u have a MM with more damage talents
[8:30:58] Slobozan: bm can use chimera shot
[8:31:01] Slobozan: and is very nice
[8:31:14] Nikola_1019: @calzenn yea, like its gonna suck nuts :)
[8:31:21] tyreh1: i do that ReallyNice
[8:31:29] Slobozan: just playing it in the raid now
[8:31:30] Rapapep: Bm cant use chimera shot huh? they are litterally in the same slot
[8:31:32] Slobozan: is very strong
[8:31:34] loudriantv: imp critical in raptro strike + heavy agi melee weaving is gonna be a thing
[8:31:38] Slobozan: if you have the xbow
[8:31:40] Saiauriel: "You are mage" Dentge
[8:31:42] smander: BM Spec can use Chim Glyph
[8:31:46] Rapapep: Yeah scuffed as fuck
[8:31:56] mazian4: @JokerdTV How many items drop from the bosses in molten core? 󠀀
[8:31:58] huisaatana: why would u use chimera instead of beast mastery rune if u go beastmaster talents
[8:32:00] smander: You dont have to use the BM Glyph Rune*
[8:32:12] Jestress: I AM MAGE
[8:32:13] summerteeth: zululDrums Shkek
[8:32:15] SupreemLeeder11: looks like Silithus
[8:32:21] cosmicoriginz: zero dps incoming
[8:32:25] kulakless: zululDrums Shkek
[8:32:27] Rapapep: tbh only thing that makes sense for BM is melee hunter.
[8:32:47] Saiauriel: zululDrums jokerdJAM
[8:33:06] Rapapep: Carve
[8:33:07] cosmicoriginz: explosive KEK
[8:33:08] smander: you can use the Chim Glyph as BM spec b/c you outscale your pet damage so once u have a good weapon (like epic bow) you edge out ur pet a little
[8:33:17] OneElbowMan: fire mage slaps
[8:33:19] Rapapep: yes
[8:33:27] Rapapep: Bm rune and spec for melee hunter.
[8:33:39] mazian4: Isn't lone wolf gonna be the meta
[8:33:49] Rapapep: dont think you are doing much ranged weaving either.
[8:33:50] Jestress: Maley
[8:33:58] Rapapep: You are prettymuch just spamming raptor strike
[8:34:02] GrandmMaster: yea doubt
[8:34:06] smander: loan wolf in a 2 hunter group 100%
[8:34:11] thisyaboycam: Lonely wolf going to be meta for sure
[8:34:15] mazian4: yeah but if you have 2 hunters of course
[8:34:25] mazian4: not solo then you're greifing the whole raid KEKW
[8:34:35] butterzugzug: as soon as the pet can't have uptime Lone Wolf wins
[8:34:38] Saiauriel: Scorch cuck iKEK
[8:34:48] Psico_420: Lone wolf Copium KEKInsane
[8:34:52] Kushiize: nah nah huinters lone wolf is gunna be bis abandon ur pets
[8:35:10] Rapapep: Lonewolf prob be bis for Mm hunter yea
[8:35:19] mazian4: 1 QoL they need to add is more stable slots ReallyMad
[8:35:22] Kushiize: throw ur pets away
[8:35:32] thisyaboycam: Isn't the pet kinda dumb AI in classic??
[8:35:33] Ryzo_bruh: Ryzo_bruh subscribed at Tier 1. 
[8:35:40] GrandmMaster: bench movement iKEK

[8:47:35] sickymalo: @Liptokk yeah current runes will scale with the higher stats from higher level gear so the dps will just skyrocket
[8:47:44] mazian4: @DnGrNBD more dps in p1 atleast

[8:48:44] zkovgaard1: @FateJ92 he did already, but it's because 30% dmg increase is not nearly enough to replace the pet damage let alone their 10% stat buff
[8:48:54] hovoxo: don't understand how they're like the easiest class
