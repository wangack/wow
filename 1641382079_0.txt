[0:43:07] newwayz92: how many subs u got ?
[0:43:29] devslewa: no r√∂rligt means that the price kwh is different depending on the day, fast means that you have the same price on kwh all day
[0:43:34] KosmosKatten: r√∂rligt = your price is dependent on the market price, fast = you have a fixed price per KWh for a period
[0:43:51] Joachimhc: Got very lucky with that. People told me to go ‚Äùr√∂rligt‚Äù
[0:44:03] Joachimhc: Exakt
[0:44:56] Joachimhc: If electricity is very expensive in the morning, you pay more during that hour if you have r√∂rligt üòÇ

[0:49:21] Th3Kr4k3n: People also know what to kick and stuff @KungenTV
[0:49:26] Creampuff1112: everything is nerfed into the ground compared to original release
[0:50:04] Crusar: its both, things do a lot less damage compared to original wrath, and you have like 3k+ on every class easily, while you had to have naxx25 gear for that originally
[0:50:40] KosmosKatten: i think its more or less correct... from wotlk there are actual combat logs available
[0:51:26] CastrowTV: @KungenTV is this Faerlina server?
[0:51:44] Crusar: i think its going to up heroics with every phase, when uld comes out, heroics tune to be equivalent to naxx 10 loot , and i assume + hp/dmg on mobs by some %
[0:52:42] Th3Kr4k3n: Heroic + will be introduced with Ulduar so they can give out Naxx/Sarth/Maly gear from it @KungenTV
[0:52:54] NBK_Sethus: tbh the chest lost the meaning on retail, its all about the weekly vault which sucks
[0:52:57] Sleepylol93: Blizz motto > minimal effort no changes

[1:20:42] ItsKensterrr: My knee pain went away when I started squatting, but I also didn't have any previous injuries/surgeries
[1:20:47] Stonnefree: Just swapping car for bike where you can does wonders
[1:20:55] Stonnefree: Also people forgot what walking is :{
[1:21:11] Dopamine______: @KungenTV  how long have you been gymming like this for?

[1:22:29] Stonnefree: All the weights wear out the joints faster
[1:22:53] nerrn: as a powerlifter my joints will be so fcked in a few years after 200kg ~ squats etc
[1:22:56] Peebo01: what was it like killing algalon WF back in the day? I felt like that boss was always so lost in this xpac
[1:23:20] Stonnefree: Calisthenics, stretches and yoga are better for overall for health purposes

[1:24:00] racma1995: can i link something?
[1:24:07] Tenhoff: CiGrip sounds to me like you just need to roll better joints
[1:24:27] nerrn: @KungenTV lifting that high is really nothing special, it's just different lifting style than bodybuilding. once you get into a programm that is build for powerlifting the weight will rise af
[1:24:34] nerrn: but you are right ye
[1:24:44] SirHiggins: @itskensterrr my balls touching the floor is my motto when squatting
[1:24:46] nerrn: @nerrn 180 at 80 is really really good
[1:25:13] serrayeu: time under tension
[1:25:27] Stonnefree: @nerrn I backed down from the gym, only stretches, swimming, cycling and Calisthenics these days
[1:25:43] eWARDson: just count, one missipie, two mipie whisl you go down
[1:25:54] Stonnefree: @nerrn My joint started screaming in the end of my powerlifting journey
[1:26:04] ItsKensterrr: @SirHiggins \o/
[1:26:05] Axiomu: if you have trouble getting into deep squats you can buy a slant board that works wonders too

[2:17:21] fevo0: For me it's the other way. Every time i'm down and depressed, I have no urge to fap. But when I am happy, do sports and go out, I'm horny all the time.
[2:17:25] Dopamine______: YEP
[2:17:42] findeee: If you stop fapping completely you will get discharges at night while sleeping, which is more annoying than anything.
[2:17:48] jean_bureau: what also helps is find a hobby preferable active which you like something like climbing

[2:22:13] Foggie: A lot of addictions are also just things you do out of habit
[2:22:14] findeee: Coffee doesn't give you energy, it just inhibits your production of GABA which is your body's neurotransmitter that calm you down. Coffee is horribly unhealthy
[2:22:18] Dopamine______: @persigno  yeah LUL
[2:22:25] karhuu: coffee smoking alcohol fucking wow
[2:22:29] UlfberhtTV: coca cola is my addiction , i guess its the sugar actualy

[2:25:19] shadowghostytv: HOW DO I FEEL A "DOPAMINE" tho?
[2:25:40] findeee: It's the reward system
[2:25:47] UlfberhtTV: its like a pressure valve that ppl think they need to use or you blow up , but you dont blow up , its an illusion
[2:25:52] findeee: @niding Yes that is correct
[2:25:55] sonikwmr: why is our brain so stupid
[2:26:02] Dopamine______: GIGACHAD
[2:26:13] nitr0us1337: because yes @sonikwmr
[2:26:26] UlfberhtTV: its not the brain , its the emotions that overide the logic of the brain
[2:26:28] Dopamine______: @sonikwmr  why is your brain talking about your brain WAYTOODANK

[2:30:34] UlfberhtTV: i had a day like that yesterday , felt real bad , today though i made some minor changes and now im fine again
[2:30:41] shadowghostytv: I wanna start walking everyday but its just i get so tired in my legs and i give up
[2:30:43] Dopamine______: @KungenTV  what is this cool looking sword u got
[2:30:54] Graspa: how you manage to perform good at the gym without carbs?
[2:30:58] shadowghostytv: where is your cam?
[2:31:09] 5iftyfourth: There is also a book that i the FIRST chapter explains Exacttly what youve been speaking about for 30 minutes. Atomic Habits by James Heard
[2:32:04] findeee: Also another important thing to know about motivation... Motivation doesn't just come to you, motivation comes AFTER you start something.
[2:32:21] jezpersson: The problem for me is stress. Outside things that you cannot control that can take me down. When car breaks down, house needs fixing, a lot of stuff to do at work. All at the same time.
[2:32:36] Dopamine______: @findeee  yes
[2:32:52] UlfberhtTV: yes agree, so instead of faping an wasting , go start something instead = win
[2:33:04] Graspa: don't you need carbs to perform well at the gym?
[2:33:45] owlsmw: it's about setting a baseline. if all your performance is fasted then your gains are based on that level
[2:33:49] farmpapi: you burn some wild number like 300%? more calories if you work out in th emorning on an empty stomach
[2:33:52] findeee: I have ADD so I have huge issues starting things.. But I've learned a trick that works like magic. I count down loudly to myself "3...2...1... GO" and my body just gets up and does it.
[2:33:57] farmpapi: really helpful if you need to lose weight
[2:34:07] Dopamine______: yep
[2:34:12] niding: @Graspa yes, but the liver will convert fat to glucose once you have expended all your easily accessiable sugar/glucose.
[2:34:16] UlfberhtTV: the health products also has been hijacked in a way for profit right , so yea its kinda false
[2:34:18] Gashunk1: saw some clip of a pro mma fighter that only eat one big meal at night, pizza and pasta
[2:34:55] UlfberhtTV: balance is the key for pretty much anything , balance as much as possible as often as possible
[2:34:56] Gnasherus: hunger comes in like peaks, once you cros
[2:34:57] Dopamine______: hangry people KEKW
[2:35:04] Gnasherus: cross* the peak, the hunger wears off
[2:35:08] niding: @Graspa this process takes around 14+ hours and is a transition.
[2:35:09] ShadowPoet: Ya I have to stop myself and drink water instead when I feel that stress hunger
[2:35:28] Graspa: I went no carbs for couple of months, and when I tried to eat carbs again my performance in gym went up by a lot
[2:35:40] Dopamine______: KEKW
[2:36:11] Stonnefree: I do Keto and Intermitent fasting

[2:36:48] celarexo: hows ur testo?

[3:17:08] BroManFlex: tanks meet in middle on mark 3 and swap over
[3:17:33] kiwiandapplez: it's super easy to do 2 stacks of 2
[3:17:46] 5iftyfourth: We did it lastnight everyone was responsible for their own sides stacks. constant movement lol

[5:58:04] devillord160: go under the lava fall
[5:58:13] devillord160: no

[7:51:31] porcamics: I think it's still cool
[7:51:33] heltvild: still is
[7:51:33] newwayz92: it was cool
[7:51:35] zimburger: I mean you have Scarab Lord mount, right? does not get better than that
[7:51:50] newwayz92: personal
[7:51:52] tygez: coolness is relative to how few has it
[7:51:52] feldaraa: my friend farmed it all tbc and up to bfa.. then he quit the game lol
[7:51:55] KosmosKatten: it was the first cool flying mount
[7:52:06] Whiskra: I used to solo Kael'thas on my paladin back in Cataclysm, you could kite the adds to the entrance of the dungeon and kill them before they rushed you down or something
[7:52:06] Timeleep: correct
[7:52:08] trainersvu: it could be 22% of the people who register their mounts on a website lol
[7:52:09] porcamics: its just easy to get right, with a little dedication
[7:52:23] D1xxless: i got it on our 6th kill. had it for months before anyone else got it, was good times LUL LUL
[7:52:27] AdamCbass: I got ashes doing a random transmog run xD
[7:52:27] 0liver_91: yeah, its only collectors left on retail wow, its the only content ive been focusing on in retail the past 7 years, i only raid on Classic WoW
[7:52:29] deah: most of my friends had it, back when i still played
[7:52:32] lsveteranl: accountwide aswell
[7:52:36] gamzzy: what % is scarab lord mount?
[7:52:41] markisen: Has been able to farm it for a long time
[7:52:51] farmpapi: yeah how many have the black qiraji
[7:52:55] ChopperDX: portal to dark portal is faster then shat
[7:53:02] porcamics: People just park all their characters outside the dungeon and do it multiple times a week
[7:53:11] nitramossss: Love Alar ü•∞
[7:53:17] Thorkad: invincible and TLP are the 2 eluding me... have so many tries on them
[7:53:31] yunalmao: gladiator used to be only top %
[7:53:40] olympie: gutentag Thorkad
[7:53:42] fulafiskarr: i never saw the blue proto back in the days. so i farmed it in cata. let my cousin join once,, and he got it...
[7:53:42] yunalmao: in bfa and SL gladiator mounts became really easy to get
[7:53:49] heltvild: that is rare
[7:53:51] D1xxless: Mirmions Head was my biggest grind. o.m.f.g how much time I spent on it
[7:53:52] Sneekyfreeky: i got mimirons head on the fifth try
[7:54:09] bluev1king: tbh i would never replace that title if i had it back in the day XD
[7:54:12] Thorkad: bonjour @olympie
[7:54:12] markisen: Human
[7:54:14] farmpapi: horse
[7:54:15] Whiskra: palomino is human one
[7:54:17] Radiag: humans get horses
[7:54:20] 0liver_91: its the human 60% mount before changes
[7:54:29] porcamics: goat
[7:54:31] KosmosKatten: a bunch of people transfered to dead servers and got scarab lord + mount in tbc/wotlk
[7:54:33] Whiskra: dwarf has rams
[7:54:33] lenb019: Ram
[7:54:35] markisen: Ram
[7:54:39] Whiskra: gnomes have mechanostrider
[7:54:42] fyrfyryes: @ayarielol easy.. still most ppl wont be able to get 2.4 + 50 wins
[7:54:43] Zafler: what website is that ?
[7:54:48] farmpapi: metal ostriches KEKW
[7:55:08] yunalmao: @fyrfyryes still extremely easy compared to before
[7:55:11] Timeleep: there used to be a mount that only 1 person had but they took it away once he tryed to sell his account
[7:55:14] porcamics: Can go straight to Kael now by the way
[7:55:22] Thorkad: I got an unobtainable pvp title on my dwarf but I don't play him anymore sadly
[7:55:42] tygez: R15?
[7:55:45] lirly__: simplearmory is good too, shows all your missing ones
[7:55:47] tygez: city guard smth ?
[7:55:51] KosmosKatten: achivements or feats for strength
[7:56:00] mottestar: check how many cutting edges u have
[7:56:27] fyrfyryes: @ayarielol not as easy as u make it out to be. % of ppl who got glad is rougly the same as before
[7:56:28] bluev1king: all realm firsts
[7:56:32] KosmosKatten: i have realm first skinner on a char KEKW
[7:56:41] Ohq__: lol you didnt get title after the fact? bs
[7:57:09] Ohq__: or ahcieve i guess
[7:57:21] mottestar: ofc u dont when achis wasnt a thing
[7:57:32] Thorkad: @kungentv how many have sergeant title from back then? I think it's gotta be low %
[7:58:13] porcamics: vanilla
[7:58:15] farmpapi: yeah
[7:58:20] olympie: kungen the mount farmer :)
[7:58:23] D1xxless: yep
[7:58:25] buzz97: high warlord
[7:58:27] Ohq__: grand masrshall no?
[7:58:28] olympie: or mount chaser ^^
[7:58:29] D1xxless: Grand Marshal
[7:58:46] bluev1king: grand marshall for alliance
[7:58:46] Thorkad: ye I got that but I don't play that character anymore... it's only per character
[7:58:59] mottestar: yeah sargeant was r14 in vanilla xD
[7:59:06] Orrkkyy: you can still get those titles today
[7:59:07] yunalmao: @fyrfyryes it has definitely wnet up and u cant really compare it to prior since wow has significantly less players than prior to bfa and SL so less ppl would have been playing after they made it easier
[7:59:08] porcamics: you can still get grand marshal from rated BGs right
[7:59:18] tygez: only the early R14 matters, when it was the hardest
[7:59:29] big_arik: yeah as long as you have gear and time you could get grand marshal ez
[7:59:33] D1xxless: yeah only 1
[7:59:34] farmpapi: like 0.2% of the top?
[7:59:34] Thorkad: @tygez agreed
[7:59:35] ghosty90_: one per week
[7:59:38] olympie: your tauren have caribou style
[7:59:41] Heewran: i got warlord then i quited after 60. rouge set 6k hp as rouge oneshot mages fun times
[7:59:44] tygez: on firemaw I think we got like 1-3 per week. Depends on the pop
[7:59:47] mrdev1lpope: depended on how many ppl on the realm
[7:59:47] Senshu123: rank 13 was solo mangeable but every week only 1 char can be 14
[7:59:49] D1xxless: per week true
[7:59:53] bluev1king: yes 1 per server and you can buy the gear and keep it even after you lose the position
[8:00:05] tygez: its % based so its not only 1 per faction
[8:00:08] Ohq__: higher pop servers was much harder
[8:00:20] tygez: depends on the pvp pool
[8:00:36] Senshu123: rank 13 + Ashkandi was enough :D
[8:00:40] Thorkad: one day I will transfer my original vanilla char to the realm I play on now and play him again SeemsGood
[8:00:40] D1xxless: my friend was grand marshal arms warrior full pvp geared outdpsed everyone in raids lmao
[8:01:04] bluev1king: the r14 gear was so busted
[8:01:15] tygez: its like bwl tier
[8:01:15] Moobot: ktvRage Stop sitting like a sack of potatoes. Sit up straight and you will feel better instantly!!! ktvYeah
[8:01:22] fyrfyryes: @ayarielol when i calculated it out in bfa s4 the top 0.8% of the ladder got glad. thats definitely more than previously, but not as easy as u make it out to be
[8:01:26] D1xxless: especially on arms warrs
[8:01:31] forsmano: turn off the error voice lines bro
[8:01:33] porcamics: was fun in TBC Classic
[8:01:36] euginatv: you played tbc when it was good KEKW
[8:01:38] Natr0N1: i did rank 11 on destromath eh - this was already hard. I was with the group that produced the rank14 every week. Everything was planned. We played Arathi basin all the time
[8:01:41] calenn9999: The real Kungen, nice to see him
[8:01:42] Pzstormy: TBC was just so slugish thou
[8:01:57] Heewran: it was hard back in the day u didnt have the cross server thing like today. Long w8 times zzz
[8:02:10] D1xxless: TBC so much running in raids lol
[8:02:45] olympie: is not a tauren is a cabirou tank :)
[8:02:52] olympie: caribou*
[8:02:57] hamsterslaktarn: Hey you dropped your Cthun ooze ;D
[8:02:57] SicDogg: whats does TCG stand 4 ?
[8:03:05] tygez: @Heewran mathematically it should be the opposite since a lot more players rank hard in classic than vanilla
[8:03:20] aloristherogue: is this brochadpumper Kungeon from nihilium?
[8:03:24] kruser: @SicDogg trading card game i guess
[8:03:26] Thorkad: @sicdogg trading card game
[8:03:36] SicDogg: thx
[8:03:42] yunalmao: @fyrfyryes you realize if u go on all wow accounts % glad mounts went from 0.0xxx to 0.6% etc during SL which may have around 1/5-1/3 of the players (thats ofc s1 SL and if we asume the numbers are correct) so yes it has gotten significantly easier especially with the current seasons where its borderline rng if u win thanks to random dmg
[8:03:55] lightgob12: Kungen the legend returns
[8:04:01] yunalmao: we should probably take it in dms instead of spamming chat tbh
[8:04:03] forsmano: this is my fav encounter ever
[8:04:14] lightgob12: The scarab lord
[8:04:19] nitramossss: Amazing boss
[8:04:20] hamsterslaktarn: What phase did you guys wipe the most on back during wf?
[8:04:25] KosmosKatten: gz
[8:04:28] newwayz92: it will drop

[8:08:53] c0kemonster: yeah dhs are at the top atm
[8:08:58] tygez: @Heewran amount of kills sort of was arbitrary, you got less honor if you repeatedly killed the same person.

[8:09:01] c0kemonster: just behind warrior
[8:09:03] buzz97: its looking very good atm
[8:09:05] Radiag: dunno about tank, but havoc is hella fun
[8:09:16] Pzstormy: DH is like an eternal reminder how far down you can take a game and still make ppl pay for it :)
[8:09:57] Ivey_Live: what are you doing ? @KungenTV
[8:10:05] D1xxless: @pzstormy Blizzard was alwaya good at breaking what was working.

[8:12:10] isincisco: Argonians from skyrim
[8:12:14] blommiiz: looks like something you'd expect to see at a furry-con
[8:12:14] thunderfunke: they should be at least big as onyxia so people would come back 4Head
[8:12:32] forsmano: blizz must have been on drugs when they came up with this
[8:12:44] D1xxless: ur gliding not even flying kekw
[8:12:45] Ohq__: i mean we had lizards in everquest LUL
[8:13:28] D1xxless: LUL LUL LUL
[8:13:43] Timeleep: haveing a flying class with wings and beeing limited to grounds in bgs ans stuff is so stupid imo
[8:14:45] forsmano: you can fly except you cant
[8:15:27] forsmano: didnt blizz give everyone in nihilum ogre costume
[8:16:22] ChopperDX: toys cannot be fetched through api

[8:16:53] Timeleep: Trading Card Game item
[8:16:53] bigbodyboy69: TCG
[8:16:57] MrAntimaterial: check wowhead?
[8:17:11] OnslaughtVQ: they commented the only reason they didnt do ogres was because they didnt know what an ogre female looked like
[8:17:28] Radiag: fel devastation
[8:17:31] lirly__: simplearmory has a better layout of toys
[8:17:34] Radiag: not part of the demon form
[8:17:37] Ohq__: i guess we get them soon through drops then LUL
[8:17:45] Radiag: its the first talent in the class tree
[8:17:48] ChopperDX: but they discontinued after UDE lost the tcg license so the idols as the tabards got extremely rare
[8:17:53] Noobslicer: It's on your bars, F I think
[8:18:18] Radiag: T
[8:18:22] Noobslicer: No, it's T :D
[8:18:26] Helten1: T
[8:19:18] Thorkad: how often do you guys see the tabard of the protector from tbc pre event these days? I wear it all the time but never see anyone else with it
[8:19:30] Natr0N1: dogo wants play
[8:19:41] Cliev1: dark portal event
[8:20:34] Radiag: you were in legion dala
[8:21:21] Natr0N1: wow that chair is top notch. kinda looks brand new! :D :D
[8:21:48] cru33: @Natr0N1 all sharp angles remowed for sure
[8:21:48] Moobot: Follow Kungen's Twitter at: https://twitter.com/WowKungen
[8:22:08] Timeleep: ill never forget the drunk streams LUL so many golden moments
[8:22:24] Helten1: if you became lead director of wow @KungenTV - what is the first thing you would do with retail? :D I share your views on most wow related things, but im not sure what I would have done
[8:24:02] olympie: mimiron
[8:24:07] forsmano: true best players should decide who gets world first, not who prepares best
[8:24:20] blommiiz: might also need to have sponsorships and get paid etc
[8:24:22] blommiiz: like they are
[8:24:33] ebnerm93: are you going to raid in the new expantion? @kungentv
[8:24:37] blommiiz: shouldnt be needed
[8:24:37] D1xxless: huh? wtf how far wow raiding has fallen
[8:24:59] Radiag: @D1xxless well thats only for wf raiding
[8:24:59] farmpapi: get rid of personal loot and bring back the loot drama is another option KEKW
[8:25:02] feldaraa: btw you dont need vehicle there anymore
[8:25:04] mahollax: Blizzard is ran by greedy narcissistic psychopaths who care only about money. No reason to even hope for a change. It is how the world works.
[8:25:05] peekaboo44: is lootcapping ppl actually fun tho
[8:25:08] vizions___: they need to cap it first 2-3 weeks after it it's fine
[8:25:19] moreten_: Then there would be no race lol, it would take a month with 2 only heroic ilvla gear a week
[8:25:31] Nitrosulphur: It get bored playing then
[8:25:36] Ohq__: have a test team so no ptr and disable weakaura
[8:25:46] renkitoza: not everyone cares about world first tho
[8:25:58] Mikazu85: Limiting gear would prolong the games content as well
[8:26:19] feldaraa: a normal raider gets 1-2 items per week in a full reclear anyways
[8:26:30] Thieem: There are only like 10 guilds in the world who are willing to put in the 15 + hours a day to compete during world first race
[8:26:38] Ohq__: didnt the vanilla team sign such a contract on onyxia and mc? i remember hearing about that
[8:26:38] ugly_gremlinn: mortal online 2 today?
[8:26:39] LashTV: I checked your armory so many times on your warrior tank back in the day lol
[8:27:08] blommiiz: literally a cartel LUL
[8:27:12] holydefpug: you can mount up
[8:27:17] Mikazu85: @feldera92 so it wouldnt be much of a difference for a normal raider, but it would be for the better guilds
[8:27:23] DasLischtlein: barcelona LUL
[8:27:25] HeinzStark: Barcelona lost
[8:27:43] feldaraa: @Mikazu85 exactly, im all up for capping
[8:27:52] Nitrosulphur: Like 98% doesnt care about world first so
[8:27:55] D1xxless: who else had Kungen armory bookmarked back in the dayc LUL
[8:28:07] buzz97: honestly it couldve been done to some extent back in the day, but it wasnt done
[8:28:09] lingslover: Lewandowski is trying but others.. can stand dembele anymore, HE DONT KNOW HOW TO PASS THE BALL
[8:28:20] Nitrosulphur: True
[8:28:22] Natr0N1: dogo in the backgrond fights white bear raidboss
[8:28:39] Mikazu85: @feldera92 Yeah i think it's a good idea
[8:28:42] blommiiz: dembele is such hit or miss player xD
[8:28:48] renkitoza: why limit the loot of the regular joe then
[8:28:50] blommiiz: so non-consistent
[8:29:26] NickNeem: Like all things in life, when money gets involved shit becomes unfair
[8:29:29] farmpapi: their hotel reservation expired KEKW
[8:29:32] miketrouts: 1 month at a lan center
[8:29:35] farmpapi: they all had to fly home
[8:29:37] Awesome_DoDo: They claimed to burn out but got demotivated cause they realized they were losing xd
[8:29:37] moreten_: The best players will always play for the best guild and the best guild will get sponsors and more spotlight. The best guild will win anyways (echo)
[8:29:50] lingslover: But in last tier if i remmeber good. Echo killed the boss, and there was 8 other guilds on last boss progressing in same time. Race was good
[8:30:21] Smekan: wtf are u even saying
[8:30:26] Noobslicer: Or blizzard can do a price pool for top 5 guilds
[8:30:34] LashTV: It's like the sponsors are racing to world first, not the community.
[8:30:56] KosmosKatten: they need to just recruit like nihilum did? no people with jobs, only scandinavian people on welfare KEKW
[8:31:04] holydefpug: Its gonna be harder on classic Wotlk tho Kappa
[8:31:14] jmasko: Time for some new world fresh servers mate! :D
[8:31:22] Mikazu85: If they did implement these changes you spoke of. Would you return to competing for World Firsts? @KungenTV
[8:31:45] lingslover: Worste thing is you need like 5 geared alts ready to go
[8:32:37] blommiiz: i would not be able to do all that just to raid :D
[8:32:37] lingslover: Now everything will be account bound, so alts will be easy
[8:32:37] Moobot: Dont forget to Hydrate ! Go grab something to drink and stretch your Legs ! ktvRage
[8:32:38] Mikazu85: yep, World of Grindcraft
[8:32:42] blommiiz: every single day
[8:32:54] NickNeem: Solo Arena Queue is one of the things I'm coming back, looking forward to that
[8:33:02] lukasp45: how do top guilds use alts to get benefits? i dont understand
[8:33:16] Void_Finest: @lukasp45 Split runs
[8:33:17] gloster90: Wow retail is such a pathetic game
[8:33:22] KosmosKatten: yes its a bit ridiculous, basically what the top guilds do is get a month or more of gear the first week from different schemes
[8:33:25] holydefpug: @lukasp45 Split raiding
[8:33:28] lingslover: @lukasp45 Some class is better for specific boss then others, and they simple switch characters
[8:33:52] lsveteranl: with personal loot they buy people that hands over drops
[8:33:59] Th4Chris: I think if you do Freya first you can port down to Mimiron directly.
[8:34:04] lukasp45: Oh i see, thank you
[8:34:52] Void_Finest: only 1 alt sounds pretty casual tbh
[8:35:01] lingslover: But there is nothing wrong helping guild you like, if they need someone in raid. Its community thing
[8:35:10] Ohq__: Not being able to progress on your main char is so bad
[8:35:11] farmpapi: I hate knowing all the zones, all the mounts, all the dungeons, all the raids and everything about an expansion before it comes out
[8:35:22] farmpapi: they need to remove PTR and use their massive budget to do testing in house
[8:35:28] NickNeem: the game should have enough content to fulfull your main char tbh
[8:35:28] zoicers: I agree
[8:35:52] ch0nkfred: They should really fix the lockouts, once you killed a boss its dead(atleast on hc)?
[8:35:52] LennyTheOldMan: @KungenTV if wow whold releas today insted of 2004
[8:35:56] NickNeem: peace!
[8:36:07] holydefpug: @lingslover But they pushed too far imo like Method who were transferring server to server to buy mats and boes
[8:36:10] olympie: one shot
[8:36:14] Whiskra: good night
[8:36:15] holydefpug: from AH
[8:36:18] WICKZ: bye !
[8:36:18] D1xxless: @lennytheoldman game would be trash
[8:36:18] olympie: good nioght bro :)
[8:36:19] KungenTV: GOTTA JET!
[8:36:20] KungenTV: GG!
[8:36:26] Shadow_28: cay dude
