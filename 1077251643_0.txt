[1:28:45] 0x10f2c: 200 to 233 costs 3k research, but requires rank 6

[1:29:42] Ulfinator: It costs way more then 3k lol
[1:29:53] ThaOriginalGamester: good ol Tuesday night football
[1:29:57] Eviltuna13: just think all 6 months of farming a zone smaller then island expedition zones rooThink
[1:30:00] Ulfinator: You can’t skip the stages so have to pay for all of them

[1:30:40] memnon94: I hated nazjatar until flying
[1:30:42] furansowah: mechagon was great
[1:30:44] Masqerader: Mechagon was fun, Naz was just aids until you could fly
[1:30:44] Blistz1: People love to compalin lol
[1:30:46] Broomba: Broomba subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 106 months, currently on a 106 month streak! 106 months subbed to the Hammer Squad!!! !nightfae
[1:30:50] storm99413: it was amazing once we got flyinh
[1:30:52] bruhSit_farmer: nazjatar was so much better compared to korthia
[1:30:53] Vrixy: nazjatar was a shitshow with the phasing
[1:30:56] storm99413: flying*
[1:31:01] Zonoxx_tv: I mean the benthic grind was one of the worst designs they ever out in for raiders, the zone itself was great
[1:31:07] ArcaneSyntax: there was basically 0 complaints about SL for like 3-4 months.
[1:31:09] bruhSit_farmer: yep
[1:31:12] KragnosWoW: timeless isle was lit
[1:31:13] furansowah: And I don,t mind Korthia, except it seems somewhat uninspired
[1:31:15] bruhSit_farmer: sad for casuals
[1:31:15] jimpzar: @Towelliee I get that Agi trinket on my warlock when im opening the Helsworn chest by the new raid got it twice
[1:31:20] Masqerader: Snorethia and Snoreghast
[1:31:27] ThaOriginalGamester: we finally got rid of PR17 and I'm so excited for once in they last 10 years LUL
[1:31:28] luckfore: well we usually dont get a zone with .1 patches anyways
[1:31:37] ThaOriginalGamester: the*
[1:31:41] bruhSit_farmer: we usually have a .2 patch by now @luckfore
[1:31:45] Nakkita76: we don't all share the same opinion about Korthia but to each his own i guess
[1:31:48] Masqerader: I don't think I touched a world boss this week lol
[1:31:53] GermanBacon: towHi hello
[1:31:59] othraerir: can't even buy ve'nari ones to upgrade to 226 :(
[1:32:05] ShinyLox: So what would you say is the fastest way to get Anima to level up the sanctum?
[1:32:06] Schnubbers: they dont innovate with patch mechanics since 8.2 anyways
[1:32:15] luckfore: @hjo1992 true LUL
[1:32:27] sakura_2020: have of those conduits don't even get used LUL
[1:32:34] filos0phia: I might be th minority but I quite like korthia. The amount of caves and shortcuts, the alternate rift zone and the aesthetic all seem great. Now the bugs on the other hand...
[1:32:41] danksly: think designing a zone around the idea it wont be a nice place to be is a bad base to build off for a zone
[1:32:43] bruhSit_farmer: my problem is the world feels so stale, farm anima for the same cosmetics that were there in 9.0\
[1:32:44] deeebag: korthia is literally just run around and look for chests, kill rare if it pops near you
[1:32:48] Kedemel: I'd prefer the polish instead of innovate.
[1:33:09] Oldduketree007: its not even a zone
[1:33:14] bruhSit_farmer: @Kedemel polish is missing from Korthia :P
[1:33:18] Patrikhg: it the first interaction with that zone is very buggy and lackluster then its hard to recover (like korthia)
[1:33:19] Capricorn4: beastwarrens is shit also
[1:33:25] Kisswani: same thing in FFXIV to be fair , new tomes , new currencies to farm , with weekly caps
[1:33:26] Patrikhg: if
[1:33:35] Schnubbers: Well yea but having a patch template is just not really good tbh. Every patch has the same mechanics. Fill weekly bar do 2 dailies grind rep thats it
[1:33:39] luckfore: lots of broken mobs and terrain issues :P
[1:33:40] smashwow: i mean the stygia is kinda dumb, them saying it won't be usable currency and there's clearly items in the new zone to be bought with it.
[1:33:45] ThaOriginalGamester: don't forget, this is the pandemic patch. they did great considering the circumstance
[1:33:54] kaldr_og: whats the addon for your nameplate and enemy nameplates?
[1:33:56] walenrus: Do ya'll think its possible shadowlands wont get a 9.3?
[1:33:56] KuruxGaming: What gonna be your main tank for the Raid this time @Towelliee ?
[1:34:01] bruhSit_farmer: yea they did amazing for 8 months
[1:34:03] JustinNotFoundx: atleast season 2 is right around the corner now the plebs cant get ksm season1 mount which is imo the best one of the 3 :)
[1:34:06] byrdeen45: sweet a 32 slot bag droped from a nest
[1:34:15] Uutef: why did you choose bear for this tier?
[1:34:26] RichTea: better than the original maw at least
[1:34:32] filos0phia: it looks like they've done an excellent job on the three main game modes (m+, raiding, pvp) but if people don't enjoy those, they might not enjoy the patch lol
[1:34:49] bruhSit_farmer: yea still average expac for casuals imo
[1:34:58] Kisswani: for a returning player , having the quest to mount in the maw makes this a great patch LUL
[1:35:01] kw3nk: But I liked ToT/Timeless Isle, why dont I like the current contetn that much^^
[1:35:03] KragnosWoW: i loved timeless isle
[1:35:14] KragnosWoW: having that lego cape made me feel like a god
[1:35:23] smashwow: what the alternative to fill bar? grinding = gathering things. (currency, mats, etc.)
[1:35:27] McLovinYoMuffin: They can create a zone with alternate progression. Like you enter the zone a assume the role of a dead hero and you have a set of new powers that you level up.
[1:35:33] Manabucho: @Towelliee why are you posting legendary crafting material on AH thought you needed it for rank 5 & 6 upgrade?
[1:35:34] RageerPLZ: All I can say, is for any job out there, which has much higher paying customers, even the simplest of problems trigger paying people and they threaten to leave. People really shouldn't defend blizzard when in reality if we were all business customer's more so then just gamers paying them things would be very much different.
[1:36:08] Manabucho: @Towelliee ah didnt think about that, thanks :)
[1:36:19] smashwow: i believe you can just buy the armor off the AH
[1:36:25] trealo94: @towelliee HeyGuys
[1:36:31] Kisswani: @McLovinYoMuffin and watch ppl complain about having no " meaningful " progression and why would i do something i will lose next expansion
[1:36:39] bruhSit_farmer: I feel like its 80%
[1:36:39] Flyingboots: Hey Toweliee, I have a small question for you, I'm thinking about coming back to wow, and I never played Shadowlands before and really wanna play prot pally, how hard is it to tank in Shadowlands?
[1:36:39] Kedemel: I wouldn't mind an expansion without a bunch of new systems.
[1:36:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[1:36:42] ColdChillXI: yup
[1:36:48] ColdChillXI: all they can do really
[1:36:54] filos0phia: @Towelliee which is why they made classic lol

[1:37:06] bruhSit_farmer: never seen so much negativity in wow before though
[1:37:12] bruhSit_farmer: its wild
[1:37:13] Schnubbers: and you are contempt with them just riding it out and pushing out mediocre content?
[1:37:15] Kedemel: @hjo1992 You new?
[1:37:19] mr3machine: @hjo1992 its crazy
[1:37:27] bruhSit_farmer: @Kedemel you clueless
[1:37:29] trealo94: New tier week CoolStoryBob
[1:37:29] 0x10f2c: People are jumping in the hate train
[1:37:33] filos0phia: @hjo1992 people hate wow
[1:37:37] Eviltuna13: As long as people keep playing they will do what they want.
[1:37:47] ColdChillXI: wow is proof of what happends when a game lasts this long
[1:37:54] mr3machine: Sadly yeah they literally cannot do anything to convince people .. just plow on
[1:38:03] lithium364: the problem is we came out of bfa into this expansion

[1:38:42] Luis_Simoes: hello from portugal OSFrog OSFrog FortOne FortOne
[1:38:42] ColdChillXI: one of the best
[1:38:43] Schnubbers: I mean legit they could have just opened the new dungeon and the patch would be already way better received
[1:38:47] mr3machine: @Cerealkillas they cant, what could they possibly do
[1:38:49] filos0phia: league of legends must be close to the age of wow
[1:38:56] filos0phia: even it's dying off
[1:38:58] Masqerader: @Cerealkillas doesn't matter what Blizzard does, you will have you're crybabies who bitch about everything
[1:39:03] bruhSit_farmer: lmao all the loot
[1:39:04] GrazzloTV: Kroke is alive and woke

[1:39:21] AveragePvp: LOL saying league is dying is a hilarious comment
[1:39:28] AveragePvp: to the guy who typed that
[1:39:33] 91Niki: @ThaOriginalGamester Wish more people would have this mindset. Instead of raging, find something else to play for a while. Come back when you enjoy it SeemsGood

[1:44:40] 0x10f2c: @AveragePvp I think alot of people are just vocal about it because they WANT the game to be better, not just to hate it
[1:44:41] Kedemel: I imagine he'll enjoy it more once the stream snipers get bored.

[1:46:31] timmythegamertv: To be fair, if you think about it, if Twitch disappears tomorrow, does WoW stop functioning? LUL
[1:46:38] trealo94: How much are you guys raiding this tier ?
[1:46:41] Kedemel: I wish there were better sandbox MMOs.
[1:46:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:46:43] 91Niki: Hell Blizzard might even have celebrated with champagne when he played FF KEKW
[1:46:46] mr3machine: Asmon literally shits on the devs non stop, them retaliating is only fair i think XD
[1:46:50] Broomba: @furansowah all over tweeter, reddit, and other outlets that Asmon playing FF1r4 pushed blizzard to release 9.1 sooner
[1:47:08] sinlesssinner: hey @Towelliee what ya think about the 1 STYGIA per rare in korthia... isnt that amazing :) hate how they made it that way
[1:47:08] bruhSit_farmer: yea those YouTube views keep them litty
[1:47:10] brain_wash: WoW is global right? Asmon represents a small portion of that, and Texas...
[1:47:12] luckfore: it would be less aids
[1:47:17] 0x10f2c: @Broomba Thats a bullshit and a half
[1:47:18] Araphas: @mr3machine exactly what asmon himself said LUL
[1:47:21] zSKIz1: New weekly reset. Can you watch it
[1:47:21] Funderik: 1 comment at him vs 10000s he's done to blizzard lol
[1:47:32] Eviltuna13: 90% of all WoW streamers are PvP now. its so boring to watch
[1:47:37] Zettabyte: even after being devoured by a black hole, WoW will still be here @Towelliee LUL
[1:47:37] smashwow: @mr3machine fair, but he makes several good points along the way.
[1:47:43] Broomba: @0x10f2c i know, but for several weeks that was the trend
[1:47:44] furansowah: And btw Asmon is fine with the dude calling him a moron
[1:47:46] SpoonManes: would you want asmons following towel?
[1:47:50] AverageJoeVet: i think wow would do better, less people would watch and play. I know i personally play less b/c i can get the storyline and entertainment from watching people like you
[1:47:53] bruhSit_farmer: rip
[1:47:53] fanousis: bubble
[1:47:56] sphynx_rayne: FFFF
[1:47:59] Pacish: Music in Korthia is good

[1:48:16] ThaOriginalGamester: i appreciate Twith and Youtube, but the meta gaming has kinda ruined the experience a little for me. I try to min/max everything now BibleThump
[1:48:17] Alepouditsa: rember what he try to do about the mount vote think? he never won
[1:48:33] 91Niki: Yeah, too fast moving chats with spam is just bleh
[1:48:39] Renzay83: he likes to read my chat towPog
[1:48:40] 91Niki: Wanna be able to have a conversation
[1:48:41] Anthy1887: lol, the best thing asmon is doing is acting as the shit magnet of twitch LUL
[1:48:44] Allvarez: so after playing korthia casually this week, i think its pretty fun
[1:48:47] Eviltuna13: Mods can make of break a channel cohhGV
[1:48:52] Allvarez: could be bigger but its got interesting things
[1:48:54] bruhSit_farmer: there's a lot of cross over I bet thoough
[1:48:55] Sollice: Ehhh we are OK mods :P
[1:48:57] proxgenic_: hey chat hey @Towelliee how are we all?
[1:48:58] bruhSit_farmer: in terms of viewers
[1:49:01] guppgup: i like that about you =) you interact with your viewers =D
[1:49:03] 91Niki: We ban those fools towBANNED
[1:49:05] mr3machine: @Allvarez Im really enjoying it, bringing my little treasure hunter friend about is super chill
[1:49:06] SpoonManes: i gets it and i agree, +1
[1:49:06] Kisswani: @Eviltuna13 and cohh is the best example
[1:49:12] KingSlayerYotam: KingSlayerYotam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! I think Blizz dont care about asmon, but when did him or any other wow streamer played other games 5 days after a new patch
[1:49:15] RocketMan23: china has their own streaming platforms though
[1:49:17] trealo94: Mods <3
[1:49:28] x2sagat: aint china on a other platform?
[1:49:39] Reaghol: i am glad he is enjoying it like he is..
[1:49:41] mrkenndy: @Kisswani cohh is a special case as he has paid mods many people dont have that kinda money
[1:49:46] Funderik: i give him a few more days
[1:49:51] Liiebe7: He wants to hit max level that then he doesnt know after that
[1:49:54] bruhSit_farmer: therapeutic to wow andys too, realise there's other games
[1:49:56] smashwow: @mr3machine yeah it's hard to not get passionate about something you care about. and they could have done better too. but like he said, maybe it'll open up a dialogue.
[1:49:56] 0x10f2c: He has a huge ego
[1:50:01] ArcaneSyntax: got the purity's edge greatblade on the first try Pog
[1:50:08] Lockrocker: the OTK World First stream was a joke
[1:50:09] Eviltuna13: He said he was going back to WoW tomorrow for raids
[1:50:21] 91Niki: @mrkenndy You don't need to pay people to get good mods. You just need to be a good human being, and you attract good people too.
[1:50:26] bruhSit_farmer: he got more views than rwf last two days
[1:50:33] mr3machine: @smashwow for sure. I also see it as someone whose identity and happiness (rose tinted) is tied to a game that cannot possibly give him what he wants anymore...
[1:50:37] Jaoda: he doesnt care about number of viewers lol
[1:50:37] Moobot: Download RAID: Shadow Legends for free on mobile or PC and get a special new players reward https://clik.cc/rUFft If you want to support my channel, please, reach lvl 10. Thanks!
[1:50:43] x2sagat: well in my opinion its a loss for blizz if he doesnt stream wow. He is the poster boy
[1:50:45] Kisswani: @mrkenndy true , but they still set the tune imo and that's te job of mods with directions from the streamer
[1:50:52] sphynx_rayne: It happens on youtube too
[1:50:57] Zonoxx_tv: The WFR is kinda cut-throat when it comes to viewers, people always congragate to the biggest stream
[1:50:59] sphynx_rayne: With videos
[1:51:00] bruhSit_farmer: he already beat rwf
[1:51:04] Kisswani: KEKW
[1:51:05] Anthy1887: LUL
[1:51:06] Funderik: ofc he does
[1:51:07] 91Niki: @Cerealkillas What kinda drugs are you on? KEKW
[1:51:08] brewgamingtv: he does care
[1:51:09] trealo94: He had 160k streaming FF on a Thursday before a holiday
[1:51:09] 0x10f2c: @hjo1992 Completely different demographics though
[1:51:10] t0pgun_: LUL
[1:51:10] bruhSit_farmer: his views last 2 days were more than rwf
[1:51:12] flebbooo: He doesn't know KEKW

[1:51:20] snaz94: what?
[1:51:21] mr3machine: XD
[1:51:26] ArcaneSyntax: he absolutely cares lmao.
[1:51:26] Araphas: If he cares, why would he stream on his second channel?
[1:51:28] board4life65: KEKW
[1:51:28] smashwow: lol as long as he's on his main channel he cares
[1:51:29] x2sagat: not true
[1:51:32] NoxAnk: If you're a streamer on Twitch, by definition, you care about viewer count.
[1:51:33] Eviltuna13: cohh1Guy its all about the viewers cohh1Guy
[1:51:33] zanriah: he says it himself that he cares
[1:51:36] mr3machine: Hollow Knight XD
[1:51:44] harpr: harpr1W
[1:51:45] elitepower97: asmon living rent free in peoples heads lol
[1:51:50] proxy2gate: who are we talking about
[1:51:51] sselesu: 'depressed or w/e' lul
[1:51:54] bruhSit_farmer: yea he does live rent free lmao
[1:51:55] xiamrs: asmon sperg spotted
[1:51:55] smashwow: that's part of the reason he made his secondary channel
[1:51:55] ArcaneSyntax: @Araphas the channel where regularly gets 5k+ viewers for doing nothing
[1:51:58] rsimpson105: rsimpson105 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! 31 months yeeehaw let’s go new raid
[1:52:00] 91Niki: You should care, but you shouldn't let it consume you
[1:52:05] Funderik: when his views start to dip, he takes few months off, then comes back and boom 100k viewers
[1:52:06] sphynx_rayne: That why I can't be a full side streamer. I care to much it would take me over to be there top
[1:52:07] devoted_bee: Asmongold cares. Zackrawrr doesn't, if that makes sense.
[1:52:12] ZethliN: if other streamers are talking about him, its already a success.
[1:52:22] Araphas: @ArcaneSyntax Yea, but he would get more if he was on his main channel
[1:52:32] sphynx_rayne: I still love soda! <3
[1:52:35] proxy2gate: asmongold only enjoyed ff14 so much because he got the most subs he has ever gotten in a single day
[1:52:39] a23pk: a23pk1 is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to Towelliee's community! They've gifted a total of 72 in the channel! 
[1:52:40] a23pk: a23pk1 gifted a Tier 1 sub to McJo3! 
[1:52:40] a23pk: a23pk1 gifted a Tier 1 sub to bigben802! 
[1:52:42] Mallaes: 👀 looking
[1:52:44] Kedemel: Summit was really bad about his viewer count. Dude used to hit major depression when his count went down.
[1:52:44] stallowned: ya then he switched to variety helped alot
[1:52:45] pavepawns: i simp my cat
[1:52:51] ReinholdtRanger: towHAMUP
[1:52:54] a23pk: I got you brother!
[1:52:55] Crypto_IX: ZillianOP cared enough to walk out on his stream
[1:52:59] McJo3: @a23pk1 Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:53:08] trealo94: the rank5 grind begins
[1:53:09] mrkenndy: @Crypto_IX HA
[1:53:10] trealo94: prayge
[1:53:12] smashwow: @Crypto_IX omg!!!
[1:53:14] DreavT2K: @crypto_ix xD
[1:53:16] DiranJei: well why would he? He pulls 10k easily on anything
[1:53:28] zanriah: soda does not give a fuck anymore he just plays whatever he feels like playing
[1:53:30] sphynx_rayne: I love soda now days. his streams are sooo lay back.
[1:53:31] 91Niki: @Kedemel Isn't he still though? I feel like he still worries waaayyy too much
[1:53:35] GrazzloTV: I like a small cozy stream
[1:53:45] Kedemel: @91Niki Probably. I stopped watching, lol.
[1:53:46] ZethliN: tbh, i love the pressure this applies to blizzard to start doing better games, because a lot of senior artists left the company just in the past month.
[1:53:53] trealo94: any justin.tv boys? HeyGuys
[1:53:57] Kisswani: even Dan let it get to him a few times
[1:54:00] x2sagat: he doesnt care what ever he streams he has huge numbers
[1:54:00] Boomhauwer: Not gonna lie you really level my train of thought sometimes bro
[1:54:08] t0fftoff: nice background bro! new?
[1:54:09] mr3machine: Streams where you cant even read chat are far less appealing to me
[1:54:09] 91Niki: @Kedemel Yeah same. But i follow him on social media. And you still see it bleed into his posts there every so often
[1:54:17] smashwow: they got too zaney
[1:54:19] 0x10f2c: @ZethliN If only it would pressure them to do better. I have a horrible feeling nothing will change
[1:54:21] luckfore: it was fun to see their mood drop LUL
[1:54:29] Sollice: @Towelliee Yeah but the OTK "RWF" was uhhh more of a variety show or something. They had no idea what they were doing
[1:54:31] Kedemel: @91Niki That's a bummer. I like Summit.
[1:54:45] Snaxsalot: @Towelliee any chance the Yankme's catch up to the Sox ( Best Record in Baseball)?
[1:54:51] Noulex: Lirik was abit like that too until he got down bad cause of it. He’s so much happier not giving a fuk these days lirikH
[1:54:52] bruhSit_farmer: ...
[1:54:54] bruhSit_farmer: then SL
[1:54:56] mr3machine: How bad was it then?
[1:54:57] othraerir: bag!@!!!
[1:55:04] stallowned: 32slot bag? POGGERS
[1:55:04] Pacish: ganddLETSGO

[1:55:08] Galadeon: nice
[1:55:10] flebbooo: wait 32 slots? LULW
[1:55:10] furansowah: Pog
[1:55:11] sphynx_rayne: I hate that streamer care about numbers. and forever to enjoy the games and things too. That upset me
[1:55:12] cevyr1: becasue what they ended up doing the last two three days of the race wasn't that interesting. They stopped focusing on gameplay which is what I really wanted in those last few days
[1:55:15] 91Niki: @Kedemel Yeah, that's one of the reasons i stopped watching. It was very obvious to me it was more about the numbers than enjoying what he did
[1:55:19] belfastcl: I remember summit wanting to play mmos but mentioning constantly that it was "killing" his stream, because viewer counst were halving
[1:55:28] Lockrocker: WoD: "Have you met my friend BfA?"
[1:55:32] pavepawns: didnt they keep swapping off the world first to random guests that had no clue what was happening in the world first?

[1:56:46] x2sagat: and he gonna outnummber any other wow streamer anyways
[1:56:48] miniath_: i mean tbf its really hard to dissociate numbers from how good you are at your job, like its completely understandable that you see numbers drop and you think, am I doing a bad job?
[1:56:50] smashwow: @Baleroc1 because in communities like asmond's you have to have a higher view count to drive subs.
[1:56:51] alibynx: trying to stay relevant is such a true thing, shoutout to souljaboy always tryning to be relevant lol
[1:56:53] flebbooo: yeah its an unfortunate truth
[1:56:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:56:54] pavepawns: cant wait for limit streams
[1:56:57] PadidinJones: Its mostly the comments and the whispers.
[1:56:58] mr3machine: Very true
[1:56:59] othraerir: doesn't he try to clear the raid day 1?
[1:56:59] Alepouditsa: @Baleroc1 i think he is thinking that he won't make as much money if his numbers go down
[1:57:02] 91Niki: @Baleroc1 Because some people can never have enough. It's kinda like most billionaires. There is never enough money
[1:57:07] 0x10f2c: They just wipe their tears with money while we cry to our pillows
[1:57:07] Orcmondo: wait your not a god!
[1:57:10] Sollice: @Baleroc1 Because some people value their self worth on how popular they are
[1:57:12] parzivals0918: what mouse do you prefer for wow @Towelliee ?
[1:57:14] McJo3: You are doing something where you are putting who you are out there and it can be tough when the feedback is negative or diminishing
[1:57:17] Orcmondo: you're
[1:57:19] sphynx_rayne: I hate my fuck job.
[1:57:27] UNSUNG_HER0: psh...feelings are a crutch...weak humans
[1:57:32] Zonoxx_tv: @Baleroc1 I mean what else are they going to use as a metric for their business. Almost no company would say, hey we are earning enough not to do quarterly reports anymore and compare
[1:57:37] PadidinJones: @Towelliee how do you handle the hateraid?
[1:57:40] Sheepfu: Ey, sometimes you get and sometimes you get got.
[1:57:51] Hybridwarhawk: Yeah there is this perception that streamers are immune to all the job negativity. I never understood why people thought that
[1:58:07] alibynx: how do some stay relevant and some wash out completely?

[2:00:32] Boomhauwer: Just like an office job
[2:00:33] Hybridwarhawk: @Hybridwarhawk Oh for sure. Even when you are working a job you love, you are still gonna have bad days/times. Most of us can't relate because such a small percent actually work a job they love.
[2:00:35] SlappyButler: @Towelliee is it easier to get into WoW Retail or WoW Classic now? Do you think Retail is too overwhelming with systems, but classic too time gated from casuals?
[2:00:36] telethen: i miss the swtor fatty empire guild. i really miss towelliee after dark.
[2:00:37] Exoduc: basicly how chance feels according to himself, he once said he is too old a streamer to die out no matter what he plays LUL

[2:02:05] UNSUNG_HER0: what happens when WoW is completely dead in 6 months?
[2:02:13] mr3machine: Is this Raid expected to be a quicker/easier WF than Nathria?

[2:03:07] PadidinJones: SWTOR could be there but they need to speed up there new content by a couple months
[2:03:09] UNSUNG_HER0: WoW is already dead compared to better games...and when Endwalker comes out it will be RIP....and when AoC comes out....ppl will not even know what WoW is lol
[2:03:11] Kisswani: and relics and what have you , but yeah , no new content till Endwalker
[2:03:12] Skydivenaked: I really hope they delay the next expansion just to make sure they have patches ready from the start, like they did in Legion.

[2:03:39] x2sagat: AoC, New World, Lost Ark and FF XIV gonna hit wow hard this year
[2:03:42] 0x10f2c: @Kisswani But relics are not that great of a content tho. Farming same instance what was it, 20 times + some other shit?
[2:03:45] Hybridwarhawk: "Better games" is very subjective
[2:03:58] UNSUNG_HER0: WoW has lost their will
[2:04:11] Blah206: I wish there was an mmo better than WoW.... Still waiting ^^
[2:04:14] Sollice: I dunno about Lost Ark... That may be too late
[2:04:16] twanlol: aoc wont be out for a long time @x2sagat
[2:04:19] Kisswani: @0x10f2c I do enjoy WoW grinds way more , not saying it's great content
[2:04:19] sphynx_rayne: @UNSUNG_HER0 then why are you here?
[2:04:21] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @SlappyButler (warning)
[2:04:21] Masqerader: worse when you're a tauren cause some you get pushed off by invisible wall
[2:04:24] PadidinJones: Being Venthyr is helpful a bit for these

[2:04:31] UNSUNG_HER0: @Blah206 obviously you havent tried to actually look lol
[2:04:40] Hybridwarhawk: @Sollice Same, I was super happy to see that become reality
[2:04:41] Kisswani: LUL that moobot delete , what ?
[2:04:42] RocketMan23: they increased the spawn rate i think, they also last longer
[2:04:43] Sollice: @SlappyButler No idea why Moobot deleted that
[2:04:59] titanknighttv: @Towelliee they fixed the chests
[2:05:00] Dinermoe: aaaaay sounds good
[2:05:04] 0x10f2c: @Kisswani WoW is great at the content enjoy, which is m+ and raids.
[2:05:06] SlappyButler: @Sollice I technically asked the same thing twice, but it was ~5 minutes ago. Didn't say anything inbetween lol
[2:05:06] 0doz: @towelliee my alts have like 2k more rep than my main... dont know why

[2:05:45] PadidinJones: @Towelliee have you tried the Qustionable Mushrooms?

[2:06:29] DocHarp: I main an ele sham, and I like mobile classes. what would be a good suggestion for a tank to pug with and play as an alt in 9.1? mostly mythic+ content. what thinking DH?
[2:06:32] PadidinJones: Pally slow!

[2:07:07] I_DoctorSatan_I: those Relic Gorgers are like treasure goblins in D3
[2:07:18] Orcmondo: ypu can get up to 300 from him
[2:07:22] generaljosh721: What's that weak aura that has the treasure things listed out?
[2:07:22] PadidinJones: UwU!
[2:07:32] Bulgogiprince: The story is so fun
[2:07:34] Masqerader: at least he wasn't like that dude in Mechagon who had the Arach mount, stopped and said fuck ya'll and kept on running
[2:07:46] Chronelos: When d2 res comes out do you think you will dive into it Towelliee?
[2:07:47] RocketMan23: i cannot stand the FF story
[2:07:52] sphynx_rayne: That me enjoying the level and store.
[2:07:58] Bulgogiprince: you almost forget you are playing an MMO when you play ffxiv
[2:08:00] 0x10f2c: FFXIV strong suit is early game and levelling while WoW has endgame
[2:08:02] sphynx_rayne: story*
[2:08:16] Kisswani: hapAyyy towPog
[2:08:16] Neldur: FFXIV is good but it makes me appreciate wow more. Especially when it comes to wows collection system and transmog. It is terrible in FFXIV
[2:08:25] Blah206: TBC is my FF fix
[2:08:35] UNSUNG_HER0: after playing WoW for 16 years I never thought something would compete truly...but after playing FFXIV for a month now....I cant believe how bad I was simping for WoW when FFXIV is soo much better
[2:08:36] rewolFv: how do you get your gold?
[2:08:39] ArcaneSyntax: FFXIV is mostly story, it's endgame progression is kinda boring.
[2:08:54] Blah206: @UNSUNG_HER0 LUL
[2:08:57] DreavT2K: I hate the story being shoved down my throat, I have this love hate thing with ff14
[2:09:08] Kisswani: @0x10f2c you think so ? I would imagine Exile's reach would be more engaging for a new player
[2:09:09] furansowah: @UNSUNG_HER0 Obvious shill KEKW
[2:09:15] sphynx_rayne: @UNSUNG_HER0 ummmm ok?
[2:09:16] I_DoctorSatan_I: I actually had a very decent Consumption group yesterday, we were so organized, we let Consumption reach 40 stacks, twice. That's rare even when there's horde mixed in, they kinda got the hint we were letting him reach 80 total.
[2:09:19] Biotechz: Freeing up all that bag space was a huge improvement on WoW's part
[2:09:43] Raequh: its more than just savage raids..
[2:09:55] mr3machine: combat in wow is so much more fluid, i guess its just different in FF
[2:09:57] Etherdon: Yeah, I'll play FFXIV each new expansion, but once the MSQ is done, I get a year or more before the next one..
[2:09:58] 0x10f2c: @Kisswani Sure, but thats like a super small part of wow early game.
[2:10:10] Skydivenaked: for me WoW have the best combat system by far
[2:10:16] UNSUNG_HER0: filler content is better than no content...lmao RIP wow
[2:10:20] filos0phia: wait which one has filler content?
[2:10:28] filos0phia: ff14 or wow?
[2:10:36] SlappyButler: Is it easier to get into WoW Retail or WoW Classic for casual? Retail seems like it has a ton of systems, but classic more time gated and attunement
[2:10:36] mr3machine: FF
[2:10:49] filos0phia: @mr3machine ty :)
[2:10:50] swordwindgaming: wow staff tells you to do filler content, ff14 staff tells you to just play another video game for a while
[2:10:53] sphynx_rayne: @UNSUNG_HER0 you know if you don't like wow you don't have to play? XD
[2:10:55] syotikz: FF14 loses me when it comes to PvP. I skip every cutscene in FF
[2:11:00] belfastcl: the raid achievements are hard in ESO
[2:11:02] Neldur: i probably made a bad choice going dragoon, i literally have to play with controller to help with the amount of buttons i have to press lol.

[2:11:14] Kisswani: the 5 ppl KEKW
[2:11:15] Blah206: pvp in FF omegalul
[2:11:19] UNSUNG_HER0: @sphynx_rayne I dont anymore lol
[2:11:26] Raequh: tbf i think wow has only mythic raiding or m+ end game and well thats not true at all. same goes with ffxiv. just have to look further in both games but if u dont want to look further u find only one or two things
[2:11:31] ColdChillXI: WoW pvp will be hard to beat for any mmo
[2:11:31] mr3machine: @Cerealkillas wait you cannot get any??
[2:11:36] RocketMan23: not having addons is a dealbreaker for ff for me
[2:11:41] sphynx_rayne: @UNSUNG_HER0 ok then shhh about it. WE get it!
[2:11:44] DragonofWolves: dragonofwolves subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months! morning chat

[2:11:53] ChubbyTonk: there is live world first race for FF
[2:11:56] ChubbyTonk: live streams
[2:11:58] ColdChillXI: I liked swtor pvp but not as much as wow
[2:12:12] casualboomer: Other games are WAY better than WoW at indicating what's going on
[2:12:12] mr3machine: @Cerealkillas that is fair I guess
[2:12:13] DreavT2K: swotor had best pvp member hudball or whatever it's cald
[2:12:14] PadidinJones: @Towelliee do you predict a disappointing raid ending cinematic tomorrow?
[2:12:15] UNSUNG_HER0: I've been supporting Towel for 5 years...you shh ;P

[2:12:35] OG_Fear: Yo yo u hoppin on swtor after korth farm today?
[2:12:37] Dexkc: I actually like the content droughts because it gives me time to finish all the optional stuff. The covenant stuff for example
[2:12:48] mr3machine: So is the min-maxing scene in Final Fantasy just not there or MUCH less than WoW?
[2:12:59] manmower: would rather watch a raiding fantasy league
[2:13:04] filos0phia: @Cerealkillas the ff14 UI is super customizable. Basically the equivalent of ElvUI as far as options go

[2:14:15] Maxc994: did you ever play star wars galaxies?
[2:14:19] RocketMan23: i just cant stand FF's base ui
[2:14:25] filos0phia: @Cerealkillas like what? I just found most wow addons were in the base game for FF
[2:14:27] UNSUNG_HER0: I love the deep dungeons in FFXIV
[2:14:30] mr3machine: Yeah the base UI in FF is.. hard to get used to
[2:14:33] Blah206: Please let New World and Ashes be good. FF ain't it for me.
[2:14:40] Todmeister9000: what about AION? BibleThump
[2:14:42] veubenta: @RocketMan23 Luckily you can change it all without addons
[2:14:46] Blah206: @mr3machine Yeah the UI is uuuggglyyyy
[2:14:49] PadidinJones: Yea it kinda defaults to your shittiest nonspec upgrade
[2:14:49] mainetrev: @Blah206 i feel that
[2:15:00] BlueBlurPrime: what do you think of the articuno mount?
[2:15:06] filos0phia: @UNSUNG_HER0 are those the 100+ floor dungeons? Those were genius idea
[2:15:06] Blah206: @mainetrev amen
[2:15:13] filos0phia: @Cerealkillas dps meter is in game
[2:15:23] UNSUNG_HER0: @filos0phia yep
[2:15:25] RocketMan23: @RocketMan23 you cant change the look of the ui though, you can move things sure, but it still has the same "theme"
[2:15:37] robgodd671: how do you get the aution mount
[2:15:38] filos0phia: I'll admit, I like addons too but FF UI is actually lit once you customize it
[2:15:58] assuran123: it does
[2:15:58] UNSUNG_HER0: but truly the best thing about FFXIV is that the community has no toxicity
[2:16:02] blade_killa: i think it does sell for gold cap

[2:16:42] mrrazputin: wowhead had track of 3 brutosours on blackmarket they all went for gold cap
[2:16:47] BigBiffyB: There is WAY less toxicity in 14 than WoW though. It's still there because it's there in any population but it's no where near as bad as WoW in game
[2:16:51] juga27: going to try Gfuel for the first time what flavour should i get? :D

[2:17:17] Chronelos: Just learn to tune those people out. You will always have toxicity no matter what game you go to.
[2:17:19] mr3machine: I heard! Pretty cool on the bans
[2:17:19] Etherdon: No toxicity in FF14. Start a Savage or Extreme and just wipe once for giggles to watch the toxic rage quits.
[2:17:22] KragnosWoW: good
[2:17:24] RyukiKay: And ultimates weapons, no way it was asmon community for those on the first day lol
[2:17:35] stallowned: ya i saw stream snipers are getting banned now
[2:17:37] Raequh: Every game has toxicity. asmongolds last stream showd it when ppl tried to ruin shit out of it. and well i agree wow has more toxicity but still every game has bad apples
[2:17:39] Chronelos: well like that one mmo thats coming out palia i am looking forward to it.
[2:17:42] filos0phia: @Etherdon this is what I was thinking too lol "not toxicicty"
[2:17:46] Chronelos: palia*
[2:17:47] Fatpally: sup chat
[2:17:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: HaxzorJimDuggan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[2:18:03] MrKhanes: Yeah Cohh was getting some weird comments in his chat. One guy wasnt happy that him and Asmongold was playing FF14, the problem was that the game was getting ques.
[2:18:10] UNSUNG_HER0: boom see...i called it
[2:18:21] Paulyepsi: i think its just more common nowadays
[2:18:23] Nightz101: goes ape mode
[2:18:23] Neldur: you will see some really toxic people in raids on FF
[2:18:26] Paulyepsi: across all games
[2:18:27] stallowned: sup @Fatpally towHi
[2:18:29] swordwindgaming: savage tier pug raids have m+ tier drama
[2:18:32] swordwindgaming: but thats normal
[2:18:35] Broomba: if i was Asmon -- and i experienced that crap the last 2 days on FF14 - - would tell all that is following him and being dicks please leave me the f alone, let me experience and play the game
[2:18:45] Paulyepsi: the longer theyre around the more it grows
[2:18:53] Etherdon: I do like their stance on DPS meters. Sure, you can use them as long as you dont let anyone else know that.
[2:18:56] SanusSangria: A lot of their toxicity isn't in the game, its towards other people. I've been attacked more because I don't play it by their players than any other game
[2:19:00] andre1023: meh i guess
[2:19:06] ContraRob: to be fair, systems like M+ and ranked pvp invite toxicity and FFXIV doesn't have that
[2:19:12] luckfore: Its sad seeing all those wow streamers play ff14 and shit talk wow and then a new patch raid comes out and they immediately go back to wow LUL
[2:19:13] ContraRob: not to the same level (pvp)
[2:19:15] Fatpally: @stallowned lost my job so im learning a new skill in the meantime while i job search
[2:19:25] Paulyepsi: fresh games always feel light and friendly but then the more people get to end game and the longer the game lives the more people turn haha
[2:19:39] kaldr_og: what addon is putting your healthbar in the middle of your screen with your class color?
[2:19:45] filos0phia: I wonder if FF14 players feel like their game is the underdog
[2:19:55] Blah206: If the FF community is this loud in July. My ear drums are going to burst in November.
[2:20:04] swordwindgaming: the raid is the point of 9.1
[2:20:07] filos0phia: they're like leafs fans up here lol
[2:20:09] UNSUNG_HER0: @filos0phia trust me...we dont lol
[2:20:11] Wildside1177: Story cool...um where de raid at!!!
[2:20:14] DragonofWolves: ok what does MSQ stand for anyway
[2:20:15] Blah206: @filos0phia They are desperate for it NOT to be
[2:20:24] Aidler: that's why high difficulty in a game is a two edged sword. many people can't handle the pressure and become very toxic
[2:20:28] brewgamingtv: your right
[2:20:28] mr3machine: so fucking true
[2:20:29] Blah206: Look at all the headlines
[2:20:30] jambii03: why taurens over the others?
[2:20:31] solsaver12: I will never play FF
[2:20:36] common_taco: 100%
[2:20:36] UNSUNG_HER0: we dont want wow players though >.<
[2:20:37] Blah206: YES
[2:20:37] Fugazi811: @dragonofwolves main story quest
[2:20:41] throwawaym3: That shit is so weird
[2:20:41] Blah206: THAT IS WHAT IS DRAINING
[2:20:41] KragnosWoW: jehovah witness knockin at my door asking if ive heard of final fantasy
[2:20:42] Blah206: TRUE AF
[2:20:42] x2sagat: WoW is in a such bad state thats why ton ppl that played wow are over at ff
[2:20:44] Blah206: YESSSS
[2:20:45] filos0phia: my thoughts exactly lmao
[2:20:45] flebbooo: yuuup LUL
[2:20:46] Kisswani: KEKW
[2:20:48] Blah206: lmao YES
[2:20:51] DragonofWolves: @fugazi811 ah that makes sense
[2:20:53] cronymahoney: oh god
[2:20:54] luckfore: LUL
[2:20:56] flebbooo: KEKW
[2:20:56] mr3machine: @x2sagat its really not though...
[2:20:57] ryte1676: FF14 is TOO weeb
[2:20:58] Dinermoe: LUL
[2:21:01] Moronil: FF doesn't need that IMO
[2:21:03] andre1023: I could never lol
[2:21:06] Noxram: @UNSUNG_HER0 Weren't you a "WoW player" when you started FF?
[2:21:11] onikid89: as much as i love the final fantasy series.. XIV is too weird for me

[2:21:28] Blah206: LOL YESS
[2:21:29] jrossino: I don’t think they want Wow players on FF
[2:21:36] manmower: if FF14 had good pvp it would be rough
[2:21:37] brewgamingtv: @UNSUNG_HER0 damn hey ff14 doesn't have toxic players but you just proved there is with your statement right there
[2:21:39] Luthaer: You know there is someone on the FF forums talking about how the influx of WoW players is ruining the game.....no one is ever happy
[2:21:40] syotikz: Been playing ff14 for a few years to me it's a casual dream rp mmo
[2:21:47] Raequh: @filos0phia Not feeling underdog at all. im playing wow and ff both tho. but RETAIL wow is just big NO for me now days i play ff14 and classic tbc only
[2:21:47] Blah206: 100% true
[2:21:49] Moronil: It's not ok to generalize :(
[2:21:51] shapetroll: i will go play swtor over ff14
[2:21:55] trevter: I mean, if Blizzard dosen't want that to happen they should make a good game
[2:21:59] Polarized5: I just wish people would enjoy their games without insulting the other, nothing wrong with liking certain games or even both
[2:22:02] UNSUNG_HER0: @brewgamingtv how so?
[2:22:03] x2sagat: thats normal every top mmo falls off. Before wow we had tons of ppl playin daoc or eq and after that it was over
[2:22:04] throwawaym3: Cultish brand worshipping is crazy
[2:22:09] manmower: competition like this is good for MMO development
[2:22:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: visit Lisa Lominsa today Kappa
[2:22:13] lanara233: Whenever I see someone playing FFXIV, they're just reading quest text
[2:22:15] solsaver12: lol
[2:22:15] brewgamingtv: saying we don't want wow players in our game
[2:22:17] Icecubedam: @shapetroll Yup
[2:22:19] Paulyepsi: its probably going to end up being a good thing of the health of WOW, strong competition motivates companies to either innovate or crumble
[2:22:20] furansowah: WoW's next expansion needs a big feature like M+ was in Legion... Islands, Warfront and Torghast aren't it
[2:22:25] arc_joe: lol like people dont do that for wow
[2:22:27] danoh_64: You think Asmon has something to do with that?
[2:22:29] Mallaes: coxDerp
[2:22:31] oSpaced: LUL
[2:22:34] mr3machine: For now...
[2:22:41] xUrb4n: @Towelliee did you get your 4 rings for hand mount?
[2:22:42] filos0phia: @Raequh I play both too, it's just the way FF mains talk about the game compared to WoW is kinda funny
[2:22:45] manmower: WoW should combine M+ and timewalking
[2:22:45] cronymahoney: gotta admit. I've been so bored with wow the last months
[2:22:49] medicintime: @Towelliee what are you plaing in progression this tier?
[2:22:50] gundamzeros01: Oceanic ,South east asia as well
[2:22:51] common_taco: I actually came back for 9.1, taking my time and enjoying it
[2:22:52] Xsilentghost: what's blizzards recovery plan with wow, like they gotta pull out something magical
[2:22:58] xUrb4n: that guy drops one
[2:23:01] Paulyepsi: @manmower that would be nice
[2:23:04] furansowah: Riot MMO might be it Pog
[2:23:05] mr3machine: @Xsilentghost recovery from what?
[2:23:06] xUrb4n: defectors
[2:23:11] pavepawns: ooooh shieet taliesin weekly is out
[2:23:11] Moronil: I play both too, I don't like this mmo war thing BibleThump
[2:23:13] DragonofWolves: towelliee did dailies reset yet
[2:23:19] Machine42593: 30 mins
[2:23:22] brewgamingtv: @dragonofwolves not yet
[2:23:23] BlueBlurPrime: 35mins
[2:23:24] Blah206: yupp
[2:23:30] Blah206: tell it how it is
[2:23:34] Poriand: 9.1 got some sick ass transmog and mounts
[2:23:36] Skyinryan: all they gotta do is bring back arthas and BAM everyone comes back LUL
[2:23:36] DehCantao: @furansowah problem is Ill be too old when it comes out
[2:23:39] UNSUNG_HER0: they think....they just dont want to show their anxiety to the public
[2:23:39] throwawaym3: They actually know the numbers, most people online are just looking for drama
[2:23:45] pavepawns: You gonna watch the Taliesin weekly vid?
[2:23:47] x2sagat: they suck if they dont care
[2:23:50] mr3machine: We should all just listen to Bellular, our lord and saviour
[2:24:12] manmower: they have a lot of options to monetize more if playerbase drops, they aren't in an emergency
[2:24:14] x2sagat: LUL
[2:24:18] DragonofWolves: because I'm 40 renown now so idk if the dailies will still give me renown unless I've hit the renown cap
[2:24:20] Dinermoe: bellular KEKW
[2:24:20] KragnosWoW: LULW
[2:24:21] BozoSkeleton: !origin
[2:24:22] Alienfromger: would be great Kappa
[2:24:23] mr3machine: XD
[2:24:24] Wildside1177: Perish the thought
[2:24:25] arc_joe: imagine devs listening to their community, crazy
[2:24:26] ArcaneSyntax: that sounds awful
[2:24:26] xxxpleblordxxx: I wonder how staffing is at blizzard. Like wod is it hurting content generous.
[2:24:31] Kisswani: " I'm unsubbing , blizz better release 2 new patches tomorrow to make me not quit "
[2:24:32] silentknight190: the game play for retail wow has been dog shit since cata thats my problem with the game
[2:24:32] Igen375: Igen375 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[2:24:32] brewgamingtv: @dragonofwolves 42 is cap
[2:24:33] Phalamore: Im enjoying the hell out of TBCC, feels so much better to me than retail....glad we have that option
[2:24:38] Broomba: that would kill wow if wow followed his adviced
[2:24:46] PullTheTricker: People treat Blizzard like their daddy/mommy... its just a corporation LUL
[2:24:49] Etherdon: WoW just needs to refocus. Forget the temporary gacha power systems and redefine class identities/mechanics.
[2:24:53] DragonofWolves: ah @brewgamingtv thank you.
[2:24:55] novembrex: Bellular ever going to release his game?
[2:25:00] throwawaym3: Changing your game based on what depressed people say, great idea
[2:25:01] Xsilentghost: they need a redesign on world content
[2:25:02] Paulyepsi: @arc_joe they do listen sometimes and then the same people will complain, its kinda lose lose for a big company like that
[2:25:04] Raequh: @filos0phia True but its going both ways and will always been like that. but mostly im embarassed by some small ffxiv streamers trying to get wievs using asmon and bellulars name click baiting ppl " asmongold switching to ffxiv" etc stupid shit :D
[2:25:05] x2sagat: well fore me after warcraft 3 reforged blizzard lost all credit
[2:25:08] danoh_64: I dont think wow is dying but in a coma atm
[2:25:12] brewgamingtv: @dragonofwolves np :D
[2:25:14] KragnosWoW: Viewer raid?
[2:25:15] SC0REGASMS: not gonna do dailies on paladin today i guess?
[2:25:18] itsStepBackJ: badass
[2:25:18] Velladyn: If they listened to Bellular every other line of text would have the word narrative in it, christ on his throne
[2:25:20] Oldduketree007: I just got 221 ilvl on my druid which dinged 6 weeks ago xD
[2:25:24] arc_joe: wow is not dying its just not living either
[2:25:28] DehCantao: That is a serious raider. While in my raid ppl will get to the door 15 minutes late.
[2:25:28] BozoSkeleton: !ORIGIN
[2:25:30] armybone1: 224 lol that overkill... you good

[2:25:46] flebbooo: I can't wait for tomorrow! New raid and a new cinematic waiting is something that always gets me hyped. Even if i have to wait to do it myself on wendesday PogChamp
[2:25:46] juga27: im really enjoying tbc :D
[2:25:47] Oldduketree007: period
[2:25:58] SanusSangria: MMO's have dry spells. It happens it's not dying it just needs rehydrated
[2:26:04] thiccsushi: Tomorrow everything is new so the hype will last until probably mid sept before people burn out again
[2:26:06] Wildside1177: Prodigal sons and daughters return tomorrow.
[2:26:16] Skyinryan: @Towelliee is it time to pull the arthas ripcord?

[2:26:45] danoh_64: I dont know it just seems theres more bitching right now than before

[2:27:07] Rock_Pile_is_Hard: wow is on life support for suren

[2:27:47] Etherdon: Well viewers are finite in number... at least real ones.
[2:28:03] flebbooo: thats a fact, i tend to watch alot more different wow streamers when he goes on his breaks. Last time i ended up watching Staysafe for example
[2:28:04] UNSUNG_HER0: ppl dont watch WoW....they watch streamers
[2:28:06] x2sagat: well i watch for the strreamer not the game
[2:28:09] AMDFusion: Nah. Every expansion wow is filled with hate. people just dont remember them
[2:28:26] Skyinryan: unless hes playing another mmo
[2:28:29] brewgamingtv: A lot of games get hate in this era of gaming. It's not just WoW that get's hate.
[2:28:29] novembrex: I miss the good ole times when this community was positive. Like Warlords and BFA.

[2:32:31] Paulyepsi: do you think they should bring back 10 mans
[2:32:34] 0x10f2c: Thats definitely the one thing FFXIV raiding has over WoW raiding. Organizing 20 is hard
[2:32:42] OG_Fear: U can do Nim Mode on 8 man as well now on swtor @Towelliee
[2:32:43] Moronil: we now also have 48 man savage, raid is called delubrum reginae @Towelliee
[2:32:45] Spanksalot_4DWIN: 20 is a pain in the ass for more casual guilds
[2:32:47] OG_Fear: So u only really need 8
[2:32:54] filos0phia: that is what makes mythic raiding a cut above tho
[2:32:55] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Remso81 (warning)
[2:32:55] akia03: are the covenanrt rare out already in korthia?
[2:33:01] Epidoral: Nightmare mode was 8 or 16
[2:33:07] KragnosWoW: Kara is a good raid
[2:33:09] DragonofWolves: thing about FF bosses and stuff is a cone tells you where an ability is hitting
[2:33:19] Alepouditsa: yes a lot of time i was having "work" so i won't do raids
[2:33:21] mr3machine: SP in SL is super fun
[2:33:23] Moronil: @dragonofwolves not in savage
[2:33:41] DragonofWolves: @tuomas_emissary really? huh didn't know that
[2:33:42] brewgamingtv: swtor raids were fun
[2:33:45] OG_Fear: Nightmare mode used to be only 16 Man However it was changed to allow 8 man Nim mode teams as well @Towelliee
[2:33:47] kaze171: darkmoon buff?
[2:34:00] elitepower97: ELE shammy rn is so much fun
[2:34:11] Epidoral: Ye
[2:34:16] Moronil: @dragonofwolves yeah, I love both wow and FF encounter design, they're so different makes you wanna play both <3
[2:34:19] OG_Fear: Uhhh TBF 16 man NIM's are Easier than 8 man
[2:34:23] OG_Fear: there is no flex
[2:34:25] Epidoral: No flex, 8 or 16
[2:34:26] OG_Fear: its either 8 or 16
[2:34:27] DragonofWolves: is savage mode in FF like the mythic equivalent?
[2:34:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: savage is heroic ultimate is mythic
[2:34:42] ShinyLox: Totally random but it took me forever to find the website. We use mythic trap to learn the fights and explain everything. Its definitely legit.
[2:34:49] Kisswani: nah Savage is between Heroic and mythic , more to the heroic side
[2:35:13] OG_Fear: Yes @k__r__a__m
[2:35:23] OG_Fear: @k__r__a__m however u get more rewards in 16 man aka more drops.
[2:35:29] filos0phia: that's what im sayin
[2:35:31] filos0phia: no trash
[2:35:34] Moronil: what about SWTOR raiding? might have time for a 3rd MMO LUL
[2:35:34] filos0phia: it's the moeny
[2:35:35] KragnosWoW: but BoEs POGGERS
[2:35:45] Siraeyou: I like that for ultimate is tuned to BiS and the rewards are purely cosmetic
[2:35:54] jrossino: Gunna be some tasty boe tomorrow
[2:36:00] Dinermoe: because of all thos juicy BoEs Kappa
[2:36:02] Kisswani: I still prefer WoW rid environment compared to the platforms in FF tho . Alliance raid environment is amazing tho
[2:36:09] Jimstur: I did my first full kara clear yesterday, was really fun
[2:36:10] Bl4ckSauce: Is the patch any fun ?
[2:36:15] OG_Fear: @Towelliee as I was saying 16 man NIM modes are easier than 8 man NIM modes 8 man DPS Checks are very tight. 16 man NIM's are way more lenient. and there is no flex its either 8 people or 16
