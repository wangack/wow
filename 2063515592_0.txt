[0:14:40] Melithian: Cam is low frame as well, tbh, at least on my end
[0:14:47] TheDutchGlaswegian: @Collected1 correct
[0:14:49] HolocronCoder: gpu melting
[0:14:54] Collected1: check the limit in your settings

[0:17:31] sapphire_rosa_: XD
[0:17:31] Rionne_tw: Steve is a decent human being yes! Now, after what I bet Ybarra and his leadership at the time pulled, plus all the backlash for what people assumed he did with the storytelling, yea, that must have sucked big time.
[0:17:31] Melinyel1: Shit bro I've missed you to loads! I Need more Tali streams LUL <3

[0:18:16] Melithian: I'm so glad wowhead locked comments
[0:18:24] HSAyril: Probably for the better
[0:18:24] SlithTheSivak: @thunduz Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:18:25] trashcatisnotamused: Thank you @thunduz ! tneMovEviHeartEyes
[0:18:26] thunduz: Steve always seemed enthusiastic about the game and seemed like he tried to make the game better for the community
[0:18:53] neverbornlucky: everyone knows its just a matter of time that microsoft takes away the wow token or changes it from *** to microsoft account
[0:19:05] brennibrennt: Hey, don't lump us into the assholes
[0:19:11] HSAyril: Someone being bad at their job doesn't justify treating someone like trash
[0:19:21] AssumptionPrime: Yeah, good for him tbh. this community is fucking terrible to the devs, of all astripes
[0:19:23] SlithTheSivak: capitalism love video games..
[0:19:29] sapphire_rosa_: @HSAyril ^^^^^^
[0:19:33] awkswow: It's insane how people have treated devs since the advent of social media
[0:19:48] Rionne_tw: Honestly can't blame him if he's now on a massive WoW business/community detox. He deserves the zen now
[0:19:50] SquiggySquonk: Video game players treating devs horribly! Whaaaat?
[0:19:51] Nulgar: @thunduz same. People keep bashing e.g. the Zereth Mortis presentation, particularly him, but I rather see this as actual devs presenting their work enthusiastically, instead of media-trained front-facing faces
[0:20:02] blumberquack: @SquiggySquonk Yeah, it's grim but it's expected nowadays
[0:20:13] sapphire_rosa_: i get so sad , i see the devs posting happy things about stuff they're proud of working on bringing to us, and underneath is always 50470674002 comments screaming about unrelated stuff :(
[0:20:14] AlanC2024: I see some people on twitch and youtube treat him pretty bad. I agree with you
[0:20:27] SlithTheSivak: allegedly
[0:20:36] Nulgar: He's bald and bearded, but not in the neckbeardy way that certain people like
[0:20:46] NotIeni: i never understood the pure hate, starting with the "Nathanos self insert" bullshit
[0:20:52] TheDutchGlaswegian: @SlithTheSivak simon whislter :P
[0:20:56] kaijoe_: Or hasn't been in a position to ignore those abuses.... *ahem* Metzen <.<
[0:20:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin they took down the usa servers while the wow token issue happen. USA couldn't play all day yesterday
[0:21:10] cicerospqr: tell that to Pyro and his Danuzer meltdown... he didnt do anything bad, but plenty of things wrong
[0:21:11] brennibrennt: He has done nothing wrong, except stating his love for Sylvanas at some point apparently
[0:21:12] DiscordianKitty: the nathanos stuff was sick
[0:21:26] Melithian: Nobbel said something super insightful the other day about this: "Weird take maybe? But 1 person does not make or break a story. Stick around long enough and you'll see a cycle of 1 name that becomes the blame for everything bad. Stick around even longer and that name becomes a hero.  It's a team effort during the good times and the bad."  Obviously he's talking about Metzen here. People complained about Metzen almost as much during his previous time at Blizzard.
[0:21:26] sapphire_rosa_: @DiscordianKitty heya! <3
[0:21:27] khalcrux_gaming: Not innocent. Not guilty and not accused.
[0:21:36] Nulgar: @notieni especially when BfA Nathanos always was the most obnoxious character, hateable in a good way
[0:22:32] Nulgar: Eh, Nobbel has hopped on the "hating WoW" train, don't give a rat's ass about his opinion
[0:22:38] ivashkov92: What’s wrong with Nathanos? I liked him as a character 😆
[0:22:41] Rionne_tw: Seriously, I hope he's regaining the zen he so much deserves
[0:22:54] blumberquack: Ngl the thing that shocked me most with the whole self insert deal at Blizz was Jesse McCree literally being named after an employee LUL
[0:22:59] aurum2509: oh yeah love Hiru
[0:23:00] NotIeni: @Nulgar yeah i liked him a lot, even tho boy he was nasty. I had friends telling me how he was a self insert because oh a haircut..?
[0:23:08] HSAyril: Was I the only one that just assumed they were always a thing?
[0:23:39] forroguetitle: people took that as self insert rather than like "omg dark ranger hint confirmed?"
[0:23:48] Nulgar: @notieni when vanilla Nathanos was more like Steve, hair-wise tneEvi
[0:23:55] HSAyril: Danuser is Nathanos??
[0:24:00] DiscordianKitty: it was so weird, metzen specifically has a character he voices that's basically green jesus but it's danuser who has a self insert
[0:24:03] brennibrennt: What a stan
[0:24:03] NotIeni: @Nulgar tneEvi tneEvi
[0:24:13] frankenfoot5: If Danuser is a self insert, then why would he write Nathanos to be a little bitch?
[0:24:18] Harper_n7: fuckin siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimp
[0:24:19] Harper_n7: idk
[0:24:30] HSAyril: Can we just leave Nathanos in the Maw?
[0:24:34] khalcrux_gaming: Worse than Hitler
[0:24:34] Nulgar: @frankenfoot5 EXACTLY
[0:24:45] vlaovich88: Why is it a bad thing the guy making the story of the game likes the game lore? Isn't that a good thing?
[0:24:57] databob1: Losts of cope
[0:25:05] forroguetitle: wouldn't that just imply that he likes being a sub?
[0:25:07] Alonarius: Y'know, even if he was a self insert why would that even be a problem? If the character is good? We love Thrall even though he's a metzen self insert 😏
[0:25:10] cosmicblood84: hey how much want bet he has a life size doll at home of her ?@TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:25:11] thunduz: yeah she almost hates Nathanos lol
[0:25:11] blumberquack: Maybe he's a little masochistic, who knows? Kappa
[0:25:18] khalcrux_gaming: She didn't know
[0:25:18] Vunderbrat: seems like commentary on how he was treated by his boss
[0:25:21] HSAyril: Simp simp simp
[0:25:22] xd_pad: nathanos buys Sylvanas bath water
[0:25:31] brennibrennt: Simps are inherently unworthy to the queen, so it fits Kappa
[0:25:33] lynscribe: OK im new to this drama, but I really don't think it's that weird to self insert yourself into a story you really enjoy? Plus it wasn't blatant so who cares
[0:25:34] the_howlermonkey: 100% read that first tweet as a silly tongue in cheek post.
[0:25:42] ivashkov92: If people legitimately believed Nathano’s was self inserted… They are stupid. that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard
[0:25:47] ivashkov92: Grow the F up
[0:25:52] ivashkov92: 😒
[0:25:56] forroguetitle: never even heard the self insert theory, that's pretty out there
[0:26:06] DiscordianKitty: Rhonin has entered the chat

[0:26:24] frankenfoot5: HOW DARE YOU TALI, METZEN IS TOTALLY NOT THRALL
[0:26:28] khalcrux_gaming: Bobby as Gallywix
[0:26:32] lynscribe: If I worked on the blizzard story team I'd self insert, sue me LOLOL
[0:26:33] plopsmurf: How many views on these tweets, I have never heard of this.
[0:26:43] lynscribe: Imagine making yourself canon in the story
[0:27:08] Nulgar: Even a person on the MMO-C forums I actually like said Nathanos was a self-insert clodagFacepalm
[0:27:08] NotIeni: wait. thats why? oh god
[0:27:11] frankenfoot5: Yeah if I were on the WoW Story team, I'd def make myself a dwarf or tauren npc.
[0:27:17] cosmicblood84: Steve Danuser how much want bet he has a life size doll at home of her ? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:27:30] databob1: Looks like Tim Curry
[0:27:39] JMan31337: oh no someone put themselves in the thing they were working on this has never happened in history ::looks at bible::
[0:27:42] neverbornlucky: Taliesin if you could put yourself in wow and have sex with one of the main hotties you are saying you wouldn't as a design do it ?
[0:27:54] kaijoe_: Metzen created MED'AN. End of story.
[0:28:03] blumberquack: come to think of it, nathanos has been in the game since release hasn't he? LUL
[0:28:05] the_howlermonkey: LMAO, are you implying Bellular made s video based on sensational commuity bitching during Shadowlands????

[0:28:26] NotIeni: AAAA
[0:28:27] thunduz: the capitalization of "Dark Mirror" should give you the hint lol
[0:28:36] frankenfoot5: @the_howlermonkey Bellular would NEVER make a video with half-assed "research" like that. Show some respect /s
[0:28:52] elbardo_ts: hello tali hazelWave how are you today? do you want to play a game?
[0:29:04] NotIeni: NotLikeThis

[0:29:45] cosmicblood84: i love it
[0:29:50] brennibrennt: Wait, there are Sylvanas body pillows?
[0:29:50] thunduz: yeah, but ok, if we ignore obvious points like the ones you are making you can see it right?
[0:29:52] cosmicblood84: i got stock in them
[0:29:53] Booostly: im suddenly in the market for one
[0:29:58] frankenfoot5: The only body pillow I want is a Garrus Vakarian body pillow
[0:30:00] forroguetitle: man, our community is kinda stupid sometimes. not as toxic as the stuff I've seen hurled at like mangaka's at least
[0:30:01] lynscribe: @cosmicblood84 LMFAO
[0:30:03] GameingAspect: whein are you sell taliesin body pillow?

[0:30:20] lynscribe: I want a Danuser body pillow with Nathanos on the opposite side
[0:30:27] thunduz: shut up you are reading to much into it lol
[0:30:30] HSAyril: Tali body pillows on your store when?
[0:30:31] AssumptionPrime: if a man and a character both have a goatee then obviously the man is bending the story of a multimillion dollar game to his own self-insert whims with no one else on the team saying anything
[0:30:34] cosmicblood84: i would too
[0:30:36] JPagan2323: its a weird take that people think this 1 person ruined a whole game for them
[0:30:36] bettys_dungeon_adventures: @Nulgar yessssssss
[0:30:37] neverbornlucky: Should we tell Evitel that Taliesin is fantasying about the horde warchef
[0:30:45] Shanhayde: you don't even need a Xalatath body pillow, just sleep with a knife in your bed
[0:30:49] plopsmurf: only a small subsect of the community think this. 90% of normies never seen these tweets
[0:31:07] djalminnha: what is his personality and ch is dont matter. The story he writes is matter nad it sucks
[0:31:10] Wrathbb1: I dunno who this guy is but Nathanos is a fuckin dweeeeb lmao
[0:31:11] databob1: I hope his next job treats him better
[0:31:17] DiscordianKitty: and they don't even know what story he's even wrote. there are still people who think he burned teldrassil
[0:31:18] Irrwege: Does a breathing ceiling at least give you the chill factor that things could be worse?
[0:31:21] lynscribe: writers self inserting? never heard of, crazy concept, mind blown omg what?!?!?
[0:31:27] HSAyril: I am the 1%
[0:31:33] Dipichipii: We made it team

[0:31:44] jhopps12: i am the only one in my friend group that watches wow news streams and YT videos, confirmed lol
[0:31:44] thunduz: @DiscordianKitty one of the most important facts here
[0:31:45] Nulgar: @plopsmurf yeah but it's the fucking vocal minority that spreads this, even to normies who have no context and believe their weird friends that this guy is "weird"
[0:31:46] Saevash: Heya peeps! How we doin?
[0:31:49] skeletonetiquette: I am elite. Success. Finally.
[0:31:49] brennibrennt: Thanks Tali, I feel special now tneMovEviHeartEyes
[0:31:51] databob1: I loved hating nathanos
[0:31:55] LordKurgen: yay top 5% club
[0:31:56] JPagan2323: its just crazy that these people say they care so much about the lore and stuff but just ignore all the problems it had before these people took over, acting as if the story was perfect and had no issues at all
[0:32:02] aeson_of_raid_sock: we are the Illuminati
[0:32:07] Harper_n7: Nice, I'm a 1%er.. I always just called myself an idiot..
[0:32:20] bettys_dungeon_adventures: fandoms are just unhinged by nature
[0:32:24] What_ln_Tarnation: i dont think hes a bad guy, but i do think he made shit stories
[0:32:28] forroguetitle: we really need some better community representation than bellulaur and asmongold
[0:32:34] Durwen: So, Tali, seeing the state of your roof, can I expect a Manscaped sponsored video anytime soon?
[0:32:41] cosmicblood84: how much are charge for a tailesin body pillow?
[0:32:46] KyleS07: First time I've heard of it, and it's a bad take. Steve was given a shit sandwich and made the best of it.
[0:32:47] jandemain: why would it make him a bad person even if it was true
[0:32:54] frankenfoot5: @forroguetitle we've got Taliesin and Evitel, and Hazel at least
[0:32:58] Nulgar: @cosmicblood84 200 subs

[0:33:17] forroguetitle: @frankenfoot5 true true
[0:33:19] thunduz: This dude is creepy and weird! Excuse me, gotta go write a paragraph about how they ruined Alexstraza with her new armor
[0:33:19] Sarkans41: THeyre just jealous they dont have a self insert into WoW
[0:33:23] KyleS07: He's a good writer imo. WoW was in a bad place when he became lead.
[0:33:27] HSAyril: Hole in the roof means Tali fell asleep on the couch last night
[0:33:53] plopsmurf: Was he main writer for Dragonflight?
[0:33:54] Nimsh: Nimsh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months, currently on a 59 month streak! 
[0:33:56] Nulgar: Yeah it's most likely: "this dude is so weird for simping Sylvanas - that's MY thing!"
[0:34:12] djalminnha: He left in November last year
[0:34:13] skeletonetiquette: Because of return to work, which was bullshit
[0:34:31] chockoholick: is there a date for when season 4 is out yet ???
[0:34:35] Nulgar: @djalminnha earlier even, November was just the start of the new job
[0:34:49] phillboww: phillboww subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[0:35:03] thunduz: probably ended his role in November because Metzen returned around that time.
[0:35:11] Wrathbb1: wait, wait wait. BLIZZARD treated their employees poorly??
[0:35:34] SamuraiWillZ916: by his own people or just the community? and who is your fave wow character?
[0:35:41] ivashkov92: I don’t think Metzen’s return coming back has anything to do with Steve leaving
[0:35:44] HSAyril: I feel bad for devs without the amount of unwarranted abuse
[0:35:50] plopsmurf: Did he write Legion and BFA?
[0:35:51] frankenfoot5: Between Blizzard being a shitty company to its employees, and the most toxic part of the fanbase probably bullying/harassing him regularly, I 100% do not blame Danuser at all
[0:36:02] JPagan2323: working at blizzard seems like a double edged sword lol, you either get shit on by the people you work for, or shit on by the people you make stuff for
[0:36:09] djalminnha: @ivashkov92 u are so wrong about it
[0:36:14] JMan31337: Metzen basically returned after his D&D book
[0:36:19] HSAyril: I mean look at the actress from Star Wars, she got hate Mail because people hated the CHARACTER
[0:36:28] Nulgar: @jpagan2323 or both
[0:36:28] Quachiri: That's what it sounds like even though it wasn't said in the article
[0:36:30] ivashkov92: @djalminnha Meh
[0:36:31] cosmicblood84: @TaliesinAndEvitel  you know man is moving on with his life there is life beyond wow and hope man is happy in all seriousness i think people read to much into it well his name is bobby koteck scum bag boss
[0:36:34] Syzmical: deserved to be removed, doesnt deserve any harrasment as nobody does
[0:37:00] bojackhorseman2004: who is steve? is he important
[0:37:12] skeletonetiquette: People want to hang the issues of a team on a single individual.
[0:37:34] plopsmurf: What expansions was he lead writer for ? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:37:40] thunduz: weird that this was only said after Steve had confirmed he dipped out
[0:37:44] lynscribe: @bojackhorseman2004 he was the lead writer at blizz
[0:37:44] cosmicblood84: steve was mad keep wow on life support for last 8 years
[0:37:48] HSAyril: Rip lol
[0:37:51] cosmicblood84: man*
[0:38:00] djalminnha: in Blizz last year there are 2 camps, Danusers and Metzen when he got a new job there
[0:38:09] djalminnha: so in that rumble only one can survive
[0:38:10] bojackhorseman2004: oh, then its good. I dont like the writing had for a long time. Good riddance
[0:38:28] thunduz: tneEvi  dirty
[0:38:30] SamuraiWillZ916: damn.... lol
[0:38:34] Eregbueye: that's so cold
[0:38:38] Graffis101: I wouldn't be surprised if it was as much for publicity as his name has negative conotions with a lot of people. He had a shit position trying to sort things out
[0:38:39] ivashkov92: Oh wow
[0:38:51] cosmicblood84: blizzard swepts people under rug make disappear
[0:38:56] doomer_dan_: @djalminnha do you have any proof of that or are you just making stuff up?
[0:39:11] cosmicblood84: they doing it for years
[0:39:13] Harai_Ulfsark: and then no one asked about him :(
[0:39:44] Syzmical: "left" is the wrong word
[0:40:04] HSAyril: Ion
[0:40:34] bojackhorseman2004: Real question is, do we think the game is gonna be better in the future from this? I think so
[0:40:35] Nulgar: Either someone left on their own terms, then they deserve privacy, or they were axed, then they deserve privacy
[0:40:36] cosmicblood84: this is microsoft coming in
[0:40:41] cosmicblood84: tbh
[0:40:53] Sarkans41: suits forced Danuser out to bring Metzen back...
[0:40:56] cosmicblood84: your sure
[0:40:57] thunduz: @Nulgar agree
[0:41:17] plopsmurf: He was lead designer since BFA? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:41:27] cosmicblood84: thats sad
[0:41:36] djalminnha: @doomer_dan_ i am not an idiot to talk about the stuff i dont know. But here is one thing, Danusers end of DF included Elune adn Mother Oatstone, Metzem scraped that and want Warcraft back to Azeroth
[0:41:38] epiclawlz: @TaliesinAndEvitel HI TALI! It was great to meet you guys at Blizzcon! Can't wait for the next one! Keep up the great work!
[0:41:52] SquiggySquonk: All of this just makes me sad.
[0:41:53] vlaovich88: It is sad. I don't like all his story but I liked his interviews.
[0:42:09] doomer_dan_: @djalminnha i didnt call you an idiot. But yeah, as i expected, you have no proof.
[0:42:17] plopsmurf: Who was in Legion and why did they not continue after their amazing work in Legion
[0:42:17] cosmicblood84: oh hell yeah he got game in a shittyput in his lap
[0:42:20] ivashkov92: 😂
[0:42:21] djalminnha: try and foound out, u have resourses
[0:42:26] djalminnha: u will be suprised
[0:42:35] ivashkov92: lol okay dude
[0:42:36] thunduz: that's the real shame
[0:42:37] kaijoe_: Can't blame him
[0:42:38] Nulgar: @djalminnha by that logic WotLK scrapped everything in BC for having another greater motif tneEvi
[0:42:42] Sarkans41: dont blame him, we kind of suck
[0:42:57] DiscordianKitty: the myths people are already building in their heads my god
[0:43:02] djalminnha: adn Azeroth
[0:43:12] dright424: Metzen loved Cosmos stuff lol
[0:43:12] frankenfoot5: I've always felt bad for Danuser to be honest. WoW has always been kind of bad at story execution (which isn't his responsibility). And WoW's fanbase is just so toxic, that no matter what you're going to lose by being a public facing person
[0:43:13] thunduz: When did The Dragon Isles leave Azereoth?
[0:43:15] plopsmurf: Nice pepapig ad KEKW
[0:43:17] bojackhorseman2004: Yes, returning to qualthalas and northrend, is def not returning to azeroth
[0:43:17] ivashkov92: Well sad to hear Denuser is gone for sure. I liked him
[0:43:21] bojackhorseman2004: Sarcasm fyi
[0:43:29] DiscordianKitty: danuser wanted me to eat vegetables but then metzen scrapped that and said I could have ice cream instead
[0:43:35] bojackhorseman2004: what a take
[0:43:35] TankenFunk: People are just making their own headcanons for this and stating it as a fact which is incredibly sad to see. It's okay not to like Steve's work, but people keep trying to justify it objectively by making stuff up which is wrong and stupid and dumb
[0:43:38] TankenFunk: Anyway me mad
[0:43:40] cosmicblood84: he got game in a shit state tbh steven danuser got raw deal
[0:43:50] thunduz: @DiscordianKitty in that case I might have to side with metzen
[0:43:50] SlithTheSivak: I think having the architect of the universe at the head of story telling is just healthy..
[0:44:00] crazidaizi: hello!
[0:44:03] HeyheyReirei: pretty sad he’s gone. I really wanted to see where he wanted to take the “first ones” lore
[0:44:07] crazidaizi: crazidaizi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[0:44:13] TankenFunk: I wasn't here, so I don't know what you know tneEvi
[0:44:25] placeholdername33: Hunter order hall was a banger wasn't it?
[0:44:38] elbardo_ts: alleria stuff more than sylvanas stuff
[0:44:39] DiscordianKitty: forbidden reach groups are great
[0:44:43] doomer_dan_: @DiscordianKitty dang metzen omega pog gimme all the ice cream
[0:44:58] aurum2509: technically not just as much chance. I could say he left Blizzard to go mars but…
[0:44:58] ivashkov92: it was really a love affair at all
[0:45:01] kaijoe_: Love affair?!? What? lol
[0:45:04] itz_killjoy: more like dasnoozer
[0:45:04] djalminnha: @Nulgar no thats is not the logic
[0:45:12] crazidaizi: watched you and evi on how you guys met the other day, made me a bit homesick 😢
[0:45:15] ivashkov92: She legit used him and he died and that was about it
[0:45:28] DiscordianKitty: i remember an old nobbel video about it
[0:45:29] KyleS07: Nathanos and Sylv were in love in life. Way before Steve was even at Blizz
[0:45:35] elbardo_ts: basically the ign writer didn't know a lot either
[0:45:35] Zivs: he mentions that later down I think
[0:45:39] Sarkans41: Nathanos was the ultimate stan
[0:45:39] SlithTheSivak: before he just seemed thirsty, danuser was responsible for the feelings being seen as reciprocated
[0:45:51] grimblymcgoo: Hes the only one that made a statement for this article. It is love affair then?
[0:46:02] TankenFunk: Thanks, Steve
[0:46:08] TankenFunk: I like DF
[0:46:11] TankenFunk: tneEvi
[0:46:11] placeholdername33: where is that line from
[0:46:12] cosmicblood84: look man love his work there really nothing wrong with it stan lee put his wife into spiderman comic book and he kill her off @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:46:23] thunduz: Did I miss this "Love Affair"? sure in the sylvanas book they had something but in-game she always treated him dirty and he was always just yes my queen. Didn't seem like much love was going on throughout BFA
[0:46:34] plopsmurf: Why did Legion lead narrative designer leave? Was it Metzen back then?
[0:46:37] AssumptionPrime: a female character called Khadgar handsome in a line written by Danuser! Khadgar is a self-insert!
[0:46:41] seanstrachan: 2 people in love that had maybe like 2 loving moments lol
[0:46:55] frankenfoot5: "Guards! Arrest this handsome wizard!" Is one of the best deliveries in Dragonflight
[0:46:57] erdls: i wouldnt
[0:47:05] cosmicblood84: dragon flight is good note go out on
[0:47:09] ivashkov92: Ahh, I haven’t read the Sylvanas story yet. They flesh out their relationship more?
[0:47:10] vlaovich88: There would be playable tuskar if you made DF haha
[0:47:19] SlithTheSivak: Are you going to be attending LFG London?!
[0:47:20] itz_killjoy: so he was around from legion to df?  no wonder wow story has sucked since legion'
[0:47:27] djalminnha: @doomer_dan_ what do u want for proof, u  can believe me or not i dont mind. I respect everyone opinion but i rly like to know stuff i have passion about
[0:47:37] Syzmical: tbf when counteracted with shadowlands, itd be hard to be hyped about DF
[0:47:42] erdls: arent we talking about just lore here?
[0:47:49] thunduz: I do like me some dragonflight. not every story beat hit but I enjoyed most
[0:47:54] DiscordianKitty: I have not loved dragonflight's story on the whole
[0:48:06] ivashkov92: hahaha
[0:48:18] aeson_of_raid_sock: I like dragons
[0:48:19] jhopps12: man I'm so exited for BFA to come out LUL
[0:48:20] Syzmical: no steve being hyped
[0:48:21] frankenfoot5: My only issue with Dragonflight is I never really understood the stakes after Patch 1
[0:48:22] ivashkov92: people in this chat are funny 😂
[0:48:23] KyleS07: @thunduz Agree. Older lore made out like they were deeply in love. Seems like that changed. But at the end of SL Sylv seemed pretty upset when she found out what happened to him.
[0:48:23] HSAyril: I can only play things in hyped about
[0:48:25] Harai_Ulfsark: next he'll ask for draenei warlocks
[0:48:27] cosmicblood84: chris metezen  left in warlords of D Let facts stand
[0:48:30] Melinyel1: 100%
[0:48:32] MythicBlack520: dragonflight do be hittin though
[0:48:36] aurum2509: there’s many games better than dragonflight, like shadowlands!
[0:48:39] inspector_zed: they've just been watching the trailer for the past two years
[0:48:39] obvious_sponge: I liked WoD
[0:48:41] neverbornlucky: Taliesin but I'm hyped for Last Epoch it proves Diablo4 has ED issues and needs a blue chewy
[0:48:54] Syzmical: yes i wouldnt be excited if i was steve if i produced SL after DF
[0:48:58] ivashkov92: lmao
[0:48:58] Sarkans41: use words better!
[0:49:21] ivashkov92: Let’s know how to effectively communicate people 😛
[0:49:32] neverbornlucky: Taliesin do you think diablo4 has a ED problem meaning Bent carrot in preforming ?
[0:49:43] HazMatt_Prime: I'm in the weird position where I think Dragonflight did good work but I don't like the expansion much
[0:50:19] maplelost: his baby
[0:50:24] Arkavien: Like Jay z, I can appreciate his greatness.  But he isn't for me.
[0:50:31] thunduz: @KyleS07 at the end of shadowlands she got her other half of her soul back, the one that did love him so that adds up I guess
[0:50:51] dotonbori: but bruv, bruv, SL was so bad bruv!
[0:50:53] djalminnha: i would say half of DF is pure Danuser, second part is scraped and chaged
[0:50:56] seanstrachan: Yeah too many people still give him full blame for shadowlands
[0:51:39] skeletonetiquette: Do you think we should give him credit for success in war within? I think there's some claim to that
[0:51:39] CrossroadsDealer: just saw your tweet. did your roof collapse? was that a plumbing issue?
[0:51:44] Alonarius: I think DF kinda rocked. First expac since MoP that I played patch-to-patch-to-patch 🤷‍♀️
[0:51:47] tastytictacs: Shadowlands was always probably gonna be an expac... It just wasnt written all too well, lol
[0:51:52] vlaovich88: @hazmatt_prime a lot goes into liking an xpac. My favorite xpac was cata but I also recognize that it wasn't great. It was just the group I had and where I was in my life that made it special. My guess is the opposite can be true where a great xpac and diminish because the group you had isn't as good or your life van be too busy to play ect.
[0:51:54] frankenfoot5: I stubbed by toe earlier and that was also Steve Danuser's fault
[0:51:56] Nulgar: Like, that the Jailer had a hand in previous lore was very likely still an Afrasiabi idea
[0:51:56] cosmicblood84: here good comparesion of chris metzen left in wod  steve denuser left on dragon flight @TaliesinAndEvitel  facts speak for themself right
[0:51:59] maplelost: so his resume is bfa shadowlands and dragonflight story ok
[0:52:00] TankenFunk: Whatever legacy Steve left behind is sadly tainted by comments like "wasn't Steve the one who ruined Sylvanas?" and people saying he was responsible for BfA. I will always feel bad for the guy for that reason and I will never stop preaching tneEvi
[0:52:09] SlithTheSivak: Vakthros
[0:52:14] DiscordianKitty: every time story feels weird it's tempting to assume it's because it was scrapped and changed
[0:52:31] CDNcameron: lol best part of comment sections on articles is people just making shit up LUL LUL
[0:52:48] brennibrennt: Sometimes a bad story is just a bad story without interference from outside Kappa
[0:52:48] tastytictacs: that means metzen wrote the family line at the end of the raid B)
[0:52:50] bucephalos: The Red Flight did not get any story but every other flight did
[0:52:59] DiscordianKitty: I don't think it was scrapped, i think people just reach for that
[0:53:02] HSAyril: I'd say the story stuff of SL that was in his control he could be blamed for, like rarely ever seeing what Jailer planned from his perspective. Or the 5D chess "I was behind everything" stuff
[0:53:10] djalminnha: oatstones, had a massive story at begining of DF
[0:53:12] neverbornlucky: we  horde are going to burn that  mother f'ing world treee down Taliesin
[0:53:12] HazMatt_Prime: I am still not sure why Fyrakk went after the world tree...
[0:53:17] itz_killjoy: im glad this guy left, he was too disney, give us warcraft back
[0:53:35] lynscribe: Alexstraza is a flop, I said it!
[0:53:36] Arlaeya: I like he owned, "guard! arrest this handsome wizard!" because that lives in my head rent-free now.
[0:53:37] djalminnha: u can be mean, have no problem with that
[0:53:38] tastytictacs: @djalminnha but those r a titan thing. the dragons have the power of the planet now, not the titans
[0:53:38] skeletonetiquette: Do you think we should give him credit for success in war within? I think there's some claim to that
[0:53:43] xd_pad: red might get more stories in .5 or .7 patches
[0:53:51] doomer_dan_: good ol dj just making stuff up again
[0:53:52] Nulgar: @djalminnha which ended then in them not re-empowering the Aspects even when restored
[0:54:06] Syzmical: i come here specifically to be berated   Pog
[0:54:09] cosmicblood84: it really feel like galakrond being raise form dead would been finally story @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:54:13] ivashkov92: @djalminnha and that story concluded and continued on  into the later stuff… Someone didn’t play DF 🤣
[0:54:33] itz_killjoy: oh no, streamer named someone, lets all @ him now chat
[0:55:01] cosmicblood84: if anything there should of been a 4th season of content
[0:55:08] Nulgar: @itz_killjoy nah I saw the message on my own - what am I supposed to do, not react to a bad take?
[0:55:20] cosmicblood84: i would believe that
[0:55:28] aurum2509: fr if there’s an actual point having a whole chat coming down on someone shames them into not arguing back
[0:55:36] bucephalos: Titans didn't give them their power again
[0:55:44] Alonarius: We're gonna be dealing with Iridikron and maybe we'll have Vyranoth for the next 3 expansions, and they're Danusser characters. Haters can suck on that for the next 6 years
[0:55:48] ivashkov92: @cosmicblood84 There is a season 4 coming out. unless I misunderstood lol
[0:55:55] kaijoe_: It's hitting on the concept of DF and legacy. Legacy of the titans.
[0:56:07] plopsmurf: Dragonflight systems in loot, gearing, m+ etc was very good. The lore was ResidentSleeper though
[0:56:08] cosmicblood84: @ivashkov92 he has no story
[0:56:09] Nulgar: @aurum2509 in my experience, they usually double down on questionable statements
[0:56:21] cosmicblood84: here*
[0:56:32] HazMatt_Prime: I'm still of the mind that all the Titans did was 'hey, you stupid reptiles. I'm giving you sapience and a job.' Not really bad guys, just humans making wolves into dogs...just those dogs are now way smart.
[0:56:36] maplelost: so oathstones exist just  to waste the players time
[0:56:41] Syzmical: alex originally must have gotten her power from the oathstones (its what she remembers) confuses me
[0:56:44] NotIeni: Btw, is it me, or community's memory is really bad(and official dev communication too)? Like people talking about how the next expacs are gonna be all connected story wise FOR THE FIRST TIME. When we already had Legion's arc from WoD to Legion with the story going directly from one to other. And BfA -> Shadowlands. And the whole thing about WE ARE FINISHING THE FIRST ARC 20 YEARS OF WOW'S STORY! When it was exactly what they said in Shadowlands (that was bad but still wtf is this messaging)
[0:56:56] kaijoe_: People take characters not knowing things or learning new things as retconning and bad story lol
[0:57:04] atamala: @maplelost huh - from that logic, the whole game is designed to waste your time? lol
[0:57:08] RoboticUnicorn007: We didnt waste our time.
[0:57:09] khalcrux_gaming: They were a story telling device. Pay attention
[0:57:22] MeggoArt: MeggoArt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months, currently on a 55 month streak! tneJellycat tneJellycat tneJellycat  sorry about your ceiling
[0:57:23] szeeman62: @taliesinandevitel When I see the headline and think this is Tali pitching a professionally acted WoW theater production; damn I’m exhausted lol
[0:57:24] kaijoe_: Media literacy at an all time low
[0:57:25] tastytictacs: weird titan stuff not good? ;)
[0:57:27] bettys_dungeon_adventures: why does everything always have to go back to wasting player's time? isnt playing the game the point?
[0:57:29] DiscordianKitty: poor tyr
[0:57:45] skeletonetiquette: The oathstones bit is a Bell vid, it's tough to have conversations with arguments that aren't there own. Missing points and context
[0:57:46] frankenfoot5: You think you do, but you don't Alexstrasza
[0:57:47] ivashkov92: I need to finish the Tyr story
[0:57:48] markaud23: lmao the first act of any story just wastes my time, it's fact. Tell me the conclusion! let me go home!
[0:57:53] Eightbitmailbox: 10,000 years can leave such a crick in the neck
[0:57:53] vlaovich88: We also accomplished a lot with restoring the Oath stones.
[0:58:05] skeletonetiquette: Yeah
[0:58:07] elderratt: @TaliesinAndEvitel THE PACING OF THE STORY
[0:58:17] itz_killjoy: danuser secretly leaving looks like he left in shame LUL
[0:58:20] Nulgar: @skeletonetiquette oh that explains why there's multiple people talking about them, usual parrotting
[0:58:21] cosmicblood84: @ivashkov92  season 4 is rehashing shit for last 3 seasons its fated
[0:58:32] neverbornlucky: Taliesin when did we start trusting everything Bell says ?
[0:58:34] AssumptionPrime: might as well say the first half of Ocarina of Time is a waste of players time because you gather the stones to stop Ganondorf but then it doesn't stop Ganondorf
[0:58:34] xd_pad: people who think that a failed plan= bad writing would be disappointed when Han Solo gets captured by Darth Vader
[0:58:36] tastytictacs: @itz_killjoy probably cuz people r horrible on the internet. lmao
[0:58:41] ka_gu_ra: @TaliesinAndEvitel I believe oathstones act as they did to show the transition to non-titan power
[0:58:47] khalcrux_gaming: If you actually pay attention to the oath stone storyline you can figure out their purpose in the story
[0:58:50] bucephalos: weren't they already aspects when the oathstones were created?
[0:59:01] MikeyGy: just came here, isTali explaining people how basic rules of storytelling work? are people rly so stupid and never read any books
[0:59:01] brennibrennt: Why are there shoes ON the couch, making it dirty? D: 😡
[0:59:01] markaud23: @ka_gu_ra Not only do you believe that, that's what they do.
[0:59:12] RoboticUnicorn007: I wish we had of been able to see Razageth's visage form
[0:59:16] skeletonetiquette: @nulgar ya, he was saying he thought it was the scrapped borrowed power system
[0:59:16] elderratt: @TaliesinAndEvitel THE  PACING OF THE STORY???
[0:59:26] grimblymcgoo: @elderratt why are you like this?
[0:59:28] khalcrux_gaming: Their history is told in the stones. The black flight most of all
[0:59:29] Arkavien: How boring would the story have been if it was 1) we need to restore the oath stones to get our power back 2) yay! We restored the oath stones 3) yay! We got our powers back!!
[0:59:29] tastytictacs: woah.. another story beat showing the titans to be sus? this game has no story!
[0:59:32] ivashkov92: @cosmicblood84 Ya, I know that. Lol
[0:59:38] elderratt: @grimblymcgoo just asking
[0:59:46] xd_pad: techically a titan did give them their aspect powers back
[0:59:50] cosmicblood84: @TaliesinAndEvitel  would you been down galakrond coming back?
[0:59:55] Nulgar: Oh, that cinematic... People complain that it spells out that it's Azeroth in particular empowering the Aspects and Vyranoth, not the Titans - but these people need that, else they would not understand that
[1:00:03] Calfast: @xd_pad dEBATEABLE
[1:00:12] HazMatt_Prime: Is Azeroth still a Titan? The aspects were acting like they weren't blessed by a Titan...
[1:00:21] mrmanno14: sorry about your ceiling mate, must have been a rough valentines night
[1:00:48] HSAyril: Wouldn't have mean Metzen didn't have much of a story control over War Within so it'll still be Danuser stuff?
[1:00:52] Nightgale96: Which cinematic?
[1:00:56] databob1: The oath stones didn't work but they put the flights back on track to regain they're  identities
[1:00:57] DiscordianKitty: been saying azeroth isn't a titan since zerith mortis
[1:00:58] thunduz: tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight
[1:00:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin what if Our planet is both Titan and Void
[1:01:07] Tokryva: a Titan is a World Soul that has been 'claimed' by Order? something along those lines?
[1:01:16] MrScotticus: It's unclear. "The Titans" might be "Titans as a faction", not "Titans as a species"
[1:01:18] frankenfoot5: Yeah that was my confusion too, since it seemed like a very big rewrite/retcon? I don't remember what evidence we had suggesting she was a titan baby
[1:01:23] Capau: @taliesinandevitel you got the fancy shoes?
[1:01:24] ivashkov92: @hsayril Yea, Steve should have a good hand in War Within too
[1:01:24] itz_killjoy: whats going on with illidan? he still baby sitting sargeras for the last 10 yrs? LUL
[1:01:26] skeletonetiquette: Tali, do you think we should give credit to Steve for War Within success narratively?
[1:01:27] xd_pad: @neverbornlucky a child of titan and old god? hmm
[1:01:29] Just_Wretch: And slyvanis literally said this world is a prison
[1:01:30] Arlaeya: Azeroth not being a titan and creating her OWN champions is rather huge
[1:01:33] LordKurgen: play the cut scene…play the cut scene.
[1:01:45] sapphire_rosa_: it is a PLOT TWIST!
[1:02:00] bucephalos: Zovaal tried to destroy the pattern of the first ones with azeroths power how could using a titan accomplish that
[1:02:04] frankenfoot5: Right, the second half of my message meant to imply that its actually a reveal. Since I didn't remember what evidence we had suggesting she was a titan baby
[1:02:06] AssumptionPrime: I'd agree that it's a reveal, but it feels like kind of an awkward reveal
[1:02:07] maplelost: is the theme of dragonflight family
[1:02:15] Nulgar: @frankenfoot5 it's been hinted/suggested since at least MoP, when a possessed Wrathion mentioned "the final Titan"
[1:02:17] irowed: oh wow 1080p/ 50 fps?  that's interesting
[1:02:19] Just_Wretch: It seems azeroth is imprisoned by titans who been less than honest with us.
[1:02:23] HazMatt_Prime: It would require a huge explanation from the Titans themselves...we should go to the seat of the Titans and have a chat with them. THEY OWE US
[1:02:27] tastytictacs: @bucephalos ya, titans cant rewrite the universe... otherwise they would have done so. but azeroth's juice can
[1:02:37] Arkavien: People really need to learn the difference between a retcon and a plot twist.  Or the concept of an unreliable narrator.
[1:02:43] khalcrux_gaming: The Titans are probably not Titans to begin with. World souls are probably just world souls and they are made into Titans.
[1:02:44] HeyheyReirei: agreed
[1:02:49] tastytictacs: the execution is a flop for sure
[1:03:00] Calfast: Story was good, presentation needed work
[1:03:09] thunduz: I feel like the story towards the middle started jumping around a lot and lost sight of where it wanted to go for a bit and then recovered at the end
[1:03:11] Teth33: I like the story. I think the storytelling was obtuse and leaned way too far into show not tell, to the point it was so easy to miss basic beats.
[1:03:30] ivashkov92: @thunduz I can see that
[1:03:53] thunduz: story not dialog
[1:03:56] maplelost: both
[1:04:03] Syzmical: dialog couldnt save it alone
[1:04:06] ivashkov92: story not dialogue
[1:04:13] mrmanno14: he wouldn’t direct his writers who wrote the dialogue?
[1:04:19] Just_Wretch: Would he have to approve it?
[1:04:25] Arlaeya: story... an outline at most
[1:04:29] maplelost: as lead he oversees everything not just the overarching story
[1:04:39] DiscordianKitty: The dialogue we know for a fact he's written has been good. Nzoth's whispers are great
[1:05:09] frankenfoot5: Tali, Tali, Tali, please. Everyone knows that Danuser writes every line of dialogue and Ion codes every single fight and Metzen draws every single NPC. Nobody else works at Blizzard
[1:05:13] neverbornlucky: Taliesin , Merrick Garland ok'ed Joe Biden document special report by hur does that mean that Merrick Garland wrote it ?
[1:05:17] avatos_94: i feel like it’s almost basic (but not bad) on purpose to set up the stage for the world soul saga to serve as the new opening expansion for leveling and introduce the story for it. the main storyline can be mainstreamed and played through easily and quickly especially with the follower dungeons for new players
[1:05:23] Capau: Does blizz have screenwriters
[1:05:26] dotonbori: DaSnoozer am i right guys!?
[1:05:26] tastytictacs: loved the tuskarr in DF
[1:05:58] Nulgar: Yeah, if you can fault Steve for anything, then that he likely prioritized the side stories too much
[1:05:59] tastytictacs: 100%
[1:06:02] DiscordianKitty: I'm finding it hard to articulate what it is about Dragonflight's story I dislike, but I really do feel like it's missing something fundamental.
[1:06:05] teodrad: I think i enjoyed WoD questing the most
[1:06:08] bojackhorseman2004: Who cares about questing when the cutscenes are ass
[1:06:08] witchhobbit: @frankenfoot5 LUL
[1:06:14] Silencbank: now, how much of that opinion is cuz tuskarr?
[1:06:23] JusticeDraws: I kinda feel bad for Steve, all it took was some large name streamer to call him out and the community gives him the shaft
[1:06:33] Just_Wretch: I don't share this criticism, but I don't agree with ur argument. Him okaying it as the narrative director is okay is passing the work as his own, no?
[1:06:33] Syzmical: DF had a valid chill vibe on god
[1:06:35] ivashkov92: Azure Span is really good! such Northrend vibes
[1:06:44] thunduz: for War Within can we not lock story behind rep? I think that's ruined rep grinding for me
[1:07:04] northshanks: @JusticeDraws This is why big streamers suck
[1:07:10] KyleS07: @Nulgar Side stories that tie to the main story are the potatoes to the meat of the game. But we also usually get more potatoes than meat so they are important.
[1:07:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin, pokemon has a anime and manga with many games that we care about the pokemon characters. Palworlds are just slave characters nobody cares about their pals what gives
[1:07:16] AssumptionPrime: I was a defender of Mists when it was current, and time has VINDICATED US
[1:07:16] bojackhorseman2004: @thunduz I actually like the way renown and trickle story style
[1:07:27] Dazzaw17: @thunduz or behind a raid, some of us dont raid
[1:07:29] HazMatt_Prime: I liked the Aberrus stuff....not much else
[1:07:32] CrossroadsDealer: the innovation we will see will be paying extra money every patch to get into the raid 3 weeks early, or if you do t pay the “premium raid” price you have to wait to get in there for weeks.
[1:07:33] skeletonetiquette: People will tell you the entire story of dragonflight sucks cause of the end cinematic, and that's just... disappointing
[1:07:53] tastytictacs: i swear the incarnates said something about sark being a literaly distraction, lol
[1:08:23] HSAyril: @crossroadsdealer seems like a bit of a leap since they've never done anything like that
[1:08:39] frankenfoot5: I hope the payoff is there for Iridikron. If he's a patch 1 raid boss in War Within then I'll be sad
[1:08:44] Nulgar: @crossroadsdealer but that'd be Microsoft's fault, not Danuser's
[1:08:53] CrossroadsDealer: Microsoft didn’t buy this IP and company not to double their money
[1:08:55] skeletonetiquette: Should we give Steve credit for Iridikron down the road?
[1:08:59] KyleS07: Xal should be the baddie for the next 3 xpacks. But Iridicron is a good side baddie to support her.
[1:09:03] HSAyril: I'd be fine with Iridikron being a patch 1 boss if he doesn't die
[1:09:04] Tokryva: hasnt it been confirmed that Metzen returning was because of the World Soul Saga, and not the other way around?
[1:09:12] ivashkov92: It makes me excited for War Within for sure. DF been a lot of fun
[1:09:18] CrossroadsDealer: @nulgar yea this will be Microsoft’s input
[1:09:24] liah_shabeouf: Do you think Iridididdy will be in all 3 expansions? or do you think he'll be a boss 1 or 2 in?
[1:09:40] HSAyril: 0 confidence is MS doing that
[1:09:55] CrossroadsDealer: metzen is a figure head. he will have little input I think
[1:09:55] bojackhorseman2004: how long has chris metzen been working on wow story design? like after he came back
[1:10:02] bojackhorseman2004: did he have an impact on DF?
[1:10:04] Syzmical: Chris picking up where he left off, the sword has always been so important and he comes back addressing it right away
[1:10:08] the_howlermonkey: i feel like annoucing three xpacs is a relatively low bar, since the selling point of them is "we are going to close storylines instead of endlessly creating more" which is what they shoul dhave been doing all along.
[1:10:17] chico_escuela: with all of that said, do you legitimately feel confident in the current path WoW is on
[1:10:20] DiscordianKitty: I hope to god Iridikron grows to the size of Galakrond or bigger
[1:10:29] cosmicblood84: Xal'atath  i think plot of wow going be that  Xal'ratath is hybird Titan and Old God and think Aezorth is 2nd hybird Xal'atath is going end up being the Nathrezim Home  World that Sargeras cleave would in half @TaliesinAndEvitel  my theroy of plot twist
[1:10:29] frankenfoot5: What sword?
[1:10:29] KyleS07: Iridicron may hate void lords as well. He wants to be completely free. Kill Titans. Betray Void.
[1:10:43] Tokryva: @TaliesinAndEvitel I have read or seen an interview that sorta confirmed that Metzen coming back was because he got so excited about the World Soul Saga idea, and not that he came in to do the WSS... I do have to do some sleuthing to find it again
[1:10:46] ivashkov92: @discordiankitty Why would he grow bigger? Lol
[1:10:47] moonkinny: he left for overwatch after pandaria
[1:10:56] tastytictacs: i always thought chris mightve left some sort of general outline, lol
[1:11:07] vlaovich88: I wasn't around back then. What did Chris leave in Legion?
[1:11:10] tastytictacs: and it just wasnt done very well past legion
[1:11:24] cosmicblood84: ***
[1:11:32] bojackhorseman2004: Big guess, but azeroth is gonna wake up and use the sword to fight a massive voidlord and then go back to sleep and thats a complete world reset
[1:11:35] cosmicblood84: do know what world this is
[1:11:42] tgrippa_: Medieval lofi enjoyer
[1:11:49] bojackhorseman2004: Calling it Kappa
[1:11:51] cosmicblood84: being cleave in half yet
[1:11:52] djalminnha: Metzen has big role in Sargears story, but after Pandaria he went to OW
[1:11:58] Syzmical: @tastytictacs agreed, im actually kinda ignorant thinking chris didnt leave a blueprint
[1:12:15] Thoreya: miss argus era a lot
[1:12:18] djalminnha: y i know that for sure
[1:12:27] Nulgar: Farahlon was WoD, Legion was Tal-something
[1:12:31] moonkinny: djal is correct
[1:12:33] Nulgar: *Thal
[1:12:34] DiscordianKitty: did metzen write legion?
[1:12:40] NotIeni: Sargeras, totally not Horus
[1:12:40] dright424: Metzen had worked on the BFA cinematic before he left, so he probably had some input on legion
[1:12:45] Syzmical: Sargeras best character
[1:12:54] TenWin: Just curious... What is your opinion of the Love is in the air updates? There hasn't been any weekly reset talking about it. XD So I want to know what your thoughts are. As I found the updates to Love is in The Air is genuinely fantastic, compared to what it was.
[1:12:55] grimblymcgoo: @TaliesinAndEvitel are you streaming at 50fps for a reason?
[1:12:57] plopsmurf: Who was lead narrative design in Legion?
[1:13:02] HazMatt_Prime: It'll be weird to make the Titans badguys after we saved them from torture
[1:13:07] cosmicblood84: @TaliesinAndEvitel  so do we know what world this is ***
[1:13:21] DiscordianKitty: he angy
[1:13:28] xd_pad: plot device
[1:13:33] skeletonetiquette: He's a force
[1:13:36] avatos_94: a state of mind
[1:13:38] doomer_dan_: he's an entity
[1:13:42] cosmicblood84: he galatus basically
[1:13:43] bojackhorseman2004: Whats the chance sargaras in the seat of the titans manages to convince the other titants to destroy azeroth? and all the titans are now villans
[1:13:44] ka_gu_ra: @TaliesinAndEvitel let's discuss truly important question - VI Cosplay
[1:13:50] tastytictacs: he's a titan that defied the titans who r starting to look like the bad guys
[1:13:50] avatos_94: he’s the friends we made along the way
[1:14:20] djalminnha: Sargeras was first mentioned in the Warcraft 2 manual (TOD) as some Deamon lord, taht is Metzen
[1:14:31] Proxzo: Metzen Left after Legion. Feralas was a Warlords thing.
[1:14:36] DiscordianKitty: @ivashkov92 because the dragon aspects fear another galakrond, and iridikron took his essence
[1:14:46] tastytictacs: did sargeras wanna destroy azeroth? he poked it, he didn't cleave it
[1:14:51] DiscordianKitty: you'd also expect him to be pretty big if he's gonna face the titans
[1:14:52] maplelost: cant wait for the asspull power upgrade they do for us to fight Titans, beings that are planetsized gg
[1:14:55] Thoreya: azeroth is the last titan
[1:14:56] aeson_of_raid_sock: Odynn was his creation, tho, right?
[1:14:57] RoboticUnicorn007: I hope we get to beat the shit out of Odin
[1:15:05] bojackhorseman2004: If they all become villans and then we kill them, there will be a last titan Kappa
[1:15:10] Silencbank: @TaliesinAndEvitel Metzen literally says the titans are returning to azeroth in the last titan at blizzcon
[1:15:11] tastytictacs: Sargeras couldve EASILY cleaved Azeroth, but he poked it
[1:15:11] lynscribe: @RoboticUnicorn007 so real!
[1:15:13] aurum2509: metzen said we’d witness the return of the titans though
[1:15:19] aurum2509: he said at blizzcon
[1:15:34] draxius34: Illidan comes to Azeroth, asking for help as Sir Denathrius and his people attacked
[1:15:37] moonkinny: in midnight Sangeras and Azeroth will conceive a child
[1:15:40] djalminnha: Danuser is responsible for Nzoth too
[1:15:44] plopsmurf: TRUE
[1:15:46] Pinochino89: tneNoSnitch
[1:15:53] valianya: @taliesinandevitel  maybe the Last Titan refers to the last Titan born/created
[1:15:59] tastytictacs: domination runes on the seat of the pantheon, domination runes on the jailers body
[1:16:02] cosmicblood84: @TaliesinAndEvitel  you know whats going to happen titans ***
[1:16:05] plopsmurf: BFA was fine tbh
[1:16:08] HSAyril: I still think we didn't kill N'zoth and it was an illusion
[1:16:08] cosmicblood84: 100%
[1:16:14] cosmicblood84: end of titans
[1:16:19] xd_pad: the real jailer still runs Maldraxxus
[1:16:36] bojackhorseman2004: I think they wanted to "hint" that the jailer was a robotish early on by hes demeanor. But it just failed. Look at the way he moves in the intro
[1:16:38] ivashkov92: @discordiankitty Ahh. true.. But Galakrond grew as large as he was due to him eating tons of dragons and consuming their power
[1:16:45] plopsmurf: The systems in BFA were so bad people gave the story too much shit
[1:16:47] DiscordianKitty: @xd_pad preach
[1:17:14] maplelost: did he come up with giving her a boyfriend too? ruined my dreams
[1:17:15] Thesummerofkevin: i just like to pretend that the jailer wasnt as important as he thought he was
[1:17:18] cosmicblood84: the titans and going get snuff out like jedi young ling 100% bet on it
[1:17:18] ivashkov92: Not sure taking Galakrond’s essence would actually effect his size
[1:17:20] thunduz: do you think depending on where this saga goes, if they take some story beats from it they could make Shadowlands more interesting to play?
[1:17:27] djalminnha: burning the tree is Alex doing
[1:17:27] DiscordianKitty: @ivashkov92 remember galakrond's powers also involved the void
[1:17:41] TenWin: I still stand for that burning teldrassil was a great concept... How it was handled and what it lead to was problem.
[1:17:56] plopsmurf: Which is fine
[1:18:08] bojackhorseman2004: I would have loved a straight up evil no fucks given sylvanas
[1:18:17] HSAyril: BURN THE NEW WORLD TREE
[1:18:25] Syzmical: So why did blizz recant on Alex's villian arc? it worked for Garrosh, whyd they want to save Slyv?
[1:18:41] Thoreya: miss bfa 8.2 on a lotttttttt
[1:19:02] moonkinny: still upset about garrosh
[1:19:04] JMan31337: Sylvanas was going to be the new Arthas
[1:19:23] ivashkov92: Yeah but I’m not convinced that means he’ll just be as large as Galakrond. idk. Imagine him being more powerful and maybe getting a newer model. Not disliking the idea though! We need more big dragons!!
[1:19:26] bojackhorseman2004: if people remember mist, people hated on garrosh. Garrosh was only dubbed a good character in hindsight when the story and characters just kept going down in quality
[1:19:29] valianya: Wasn't Afrasiabi making Sylvanas a villain because Sylvanas wasn't his character and he wanted to wreck her?
[1:19:52] dday_movies: I remember the burning of Tekdrassil being kind of a cool moment and a huge status quo change. I know people didn’t like it, but I thought it was cool and made me, as a horde player, feel like shit and want to do something about it.
[1:20:02] HSAyril: I'm so happy Garrosh didn't change his mind or show remorse in the raid
[1:20:02] moonkinny: the minus of mists was including garrosh
[1:20:07] KyleS07: Full villain would have been better than what we got. I think.
[1:20:13] moonkinny: me too loved that raid scene
[1:20:21] HolocronCoder: We really are due for an Alliance Leader villain arc
[1:20:47] dotonbori: Why could they not kill her?
[1:20:48] cosmicblood84: you know it was half ass done look what happen to malfurion stormrage during tree burning too @TaliesinAndEvitel  think about that
[1:20:49] DiscordianKitty: @HolocronCoder i really hope we get one
[1:20:55] HSAyril: @holocroncoder Turalyon
[1:21:03] GameingAspect: coma syv;amas
[1:21:03] bucephalos: sylvanas already went bonkers in cataclysm in my opinion
[1:21:19] bojackhorseman2004: Why couldnt they just done the shes full evil but manages to get away BS like they done before?
[1:21:25] aurum2509: yeah at the end of wrath was when she met the jailer
[1:21:30] JusticeDraws: I think they got rid of her the right way though lol I didn't think it was bad
[1:21:30] AngryInternetCat: Tali! Saw the article on PC Gamer about Steve Danuser. He's reviled, but I liked him
[1:21:32] bojackhorseman2004: instead of the random "no i am actually good"
[1:21:35] cosmicblood84: they can even kill malfurion stormrage lets be honest
[1:21:37] Rajven: here is a turd, now polish it :)
[1:21:43] djalminnha: u have smiliar thing with Malfurion in DF. Where Blizz did oldswitcheroo
[1:21:45] moonkinny: Goldshire creepie children grow up and try to resurrect old gods
[1:21:50] Syzmical: A true shame, Feel steve could've made it work, but good insight tali.
[1:21:51] CrossroadsDealer: people “NPC story characters” need to die. it is the thing that makes Azeroth feel like it has weight. especially when our characters are immortal.
[1:22:02] cosmicblood84: try 2 twice bfa and in shadowlands
[1:22:05] aurum2509: @cosmicblood84 malfurion? who’s that?
[1:22:09] Thesummerofkevin: malfurion and ysera switching had no point to it, its too funny
[1:22:10] dotonbori: I'm not really sure behind the thinking of not being able to kill her. Is she that popular? She's always just been 'the sexy undead elf'
[1:22:14] plopsmurf: BFA story was not bad, we should de a retrospect
[1:22:20] moonkinny: talie I agree it is as a bit of a mess they inherited
[1:22:20] HazMatt_Prime: And that's how we got the best villain ever, the Jailer
[1:22:27] maplelost: cringe
[1:22:30] KeyouiX: as a sylvanas fan we got the best of a shit situation
[1:22:31] cosmicblood84: @aurum2509 malfurion stormrage?
[1:22:32] bojackhorseman2004: Cringe
[1:22:34] cosmicblood84: malfurion stormrage really
[1:22:37] HSAyril: They wouldn't have a patch if Malf. was still here because he'd solo Fyrakk
[1:22:42] TenWin: Big disagree
[1:22:42] valianya: Should have done full Old God or Jailer corruption and control of her.  Saving her from it at the end and stomping the one controlling her would have satisfied that
[1:22:44] DiscordianKitty: i still think they did the best they possibly could have with sylvanas, considering what they were given to do
[1:22:55] bojackhorseman2004: Sylvanas ending was good?
[1:22:58] emmaartistz: !Discord
[1:23:00] plopsmurf: What even happened to Sylvannes?
[1:23:07] CrossroadsDealer: Tarabda showing up at the end with her huge back muscles made it all feel good.
[1:23:10] cosmicblood84: ***
[1:23:13] yorden: It's hard to polish a turd but they made the most of it
[1:23:14] DiscordianKitty: the book is great
[1:23:16] DiscordianKitty: just realized you disagreed with me about a lore opinion and i didn't even call you a bad father, I'm so bad at this, no wonder i never get anywhere on wow twitter
[1:23:17] CrossroadsDealer: Taranda*
[1:23:20] blumberquack: The trial was fine, but why did tyrande force the owl to keep watch? :(
[1:23:25] Nightgale96: tbh I would've liked if they'd straight up murderer her as horribly as they could've in a sense. And I love her character, I just found the resolution somewhat lackluster personally, it felt like it removed her actions
[1:23:27] KyleS07: They did the best they could. The resolution felt satisfactory.
[1:23:27] blumberquack: Owl didn't deserve that
[1:23:28] KeyouiX: the only thing better would have been the villian arc never happening
[1:23:28] mythryllpala: I love the banshee queen. I want her back
[1:23:33] moonkinny: I liked the sylvannas ending as well given how weird the whole idea was
[1:23:39] TenWin: I just think she had done waaaay too much. At the least way too much for her to be allowed to return. The punishment makes sense. Her "returning" after finishing it is what I am completely against.
[1:23:42] bojackhorseman2004: @TaliesinAndEvitel can you explain what you like about the ending? why is it good?
[1:23:44] JusticeDraws: If we are going back in time to Quel in Midnight we get to see Sylvanas alive haha MOMMY RANGER
[1:23:45] ka_gu_ra: i wouldn't say it was good. I would say it was the best possible salvation of the story
[1:23:52] plopsmurf: BFA sucked because of all the shit Loot and Gearing systems. The players would not care so much about the story if BFA was not burning pile of shit from all the systems
[1:23:52] Noznatation: In the situation they had put themselves into - I agree, they did save what they could with the ending.
[1:23:57] avatos_94: justice for the owl 🫡
[1:23:58] tastytictacs: poor owl stuck in purgatory
[1:24:02] cosmicblood84: that poor owl got fucked
[1:24:13] HSAyril: How is the owl supposed to get out to report anything?
[1:24:13] Just_Wretch: When usher went into sylvanis dreams I think that was a bit clunky
[1:24:14] moonkinny: need a whole xpac to save the owl
[1:24:17] CrossroadsDealer: Taranda’s back muscles were the best story line ending ever.  10/10
[1:24:33] Just_Wretch: *uther
[1:24:41] moonkinny: I played Maldraxus. I love it
[1:24:43] Silencbank: does anduin being back on azeroth mean that sylvanas could be back as well?  Didnt anduin stay around to watch sylvanas as well?
[1:24:45] Syzmical: IMO best case scenario would have been embrace slyv's fate at that point, Steve could have done it. Would have resulted in much less muddled narative
[1:24:46] djalminnha: i accept that they need recover a lot with sylvanas, but my stomach cannot procces shadowlands
[1:25:02] TenWin: I just think she had done waaaay too much. At the least way too much for her to be allowed to return. The punishment makes sense. Her "returning" after finishing it is what I am completely against. As by all technicaity is there an "out" for Sylvanas.
[1:25:08] Syzmical: yeah garrosh her
[1:25:12] Noznatation: It will would be like ukranie winning the war - it is the best resultiion but everyone would have prefered the story didn't go that what to start with :D
[1:25:13] seanstrachan: @silencbank no Anduin leaves the Maw at the end of SL l. He literally says goodbye to her lol
[1:25:18] KeyouiX: i would have hated them killing her
[1:25:19] DiscordianKitty: I've read a lot of people's ideas of what would have been better and they're so often much, much worse
[1:25:29] HSAyril: Anduin stayed to soul search, Sylv. was a punishment. He could leave if he wanted
[1:25:31] moonkinny: sylvannas frees garrosh and they come back
[1:25:32] Silencbank: @seanstrachan ahh thanks, didnt play end of shadowlands
[1:25:35] djalminnha: Sylvanas prob will be back at Midnight
[1:25:37] Shanhayde: The end of Sylvanas was good but also very frustrating on a few points
[1:25:38] Rajven: it wasnt a good ending, but best ending they could do with what they was given.
[1:25:40] Syzmical: 100%
[1:25:47] theszoti: but she hasn't been around since, so the result is the same as killing her off
[1:25:49] ka_gu_ra: i agree. all i'm saying if we look at it from the story point of view without behind the scene. It is a bad story
[1:25:57] bojackhorseman2004: So they where forced not to kill her? but where they forced to try to make her morally gray?
[1:25:57] Nulgar: I can't believe you keep having to explain this, like 3 years after first doing it
[1:25:59] HSAyril: Let's keep her in the Maw for as long as possible
[1:26:01] Eprosis: Will we ever find out what the Jailer saw?
[1:26:06] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can the undead take shits ?
[1:26:10] avatos_94: i think she’ll sacrifice herself at the end of midnight or smth
[1:26:15] maplelost: its hard to imagine how it couuld be wrose
[1:26:20] shamethehomegame: eh, the distinction between a good landing and a controlled crash
[1:26:24] bojackhorseman2004: The whole trying to make her morally gray is the bad part, which idk if they where forced to...
[1:26:29] djalminnha: theyx did well, but shadowlands is shithousery
[1:26:29] plopsmurf: @TaliesinAndEvitel How was he allowed to setup this story for Sylvannes to die if the execs think she is too valuable?
[1:26:35] HazMatt_Prime: Is it only weird to me that the heroes of Azeroth is stronger than Hell? Why are we so op
[1:26:46] MrScotticus: @bojackhorseman2004 They didn't try to make her morally gray
[1:26:53] HolocronCoder: Worse: "But it was all just a bad dream..."
[1:26:57] moonkinny: the best part of the horde was that they were misunderstood not evil
[1:26:58] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel I am curious... What makes Sylvanas more Valuable than Varian? Conaisering that Varian was apparently someone they could remove, but Sylvanas isn't? What, is that the power of boobs?
[1:26:59] KyleS07: @KeyouiX After the destruction of her character since Cata, I was ok with her death. I'm glad she didn't get killed, but given the story path before "saving" her, her death would have been acceptable.
[1:27:02] plopsmurf: His legacy is Jailer, which was shit
[1:27:06] cosmicblood84: Malfurion Stormrage was knock out sstory by Saurfang and then in Shadowland Same thing was done Yesra Arc too @TaliesinAndEvitel  Right to Mirror what going Sylvanas
[1:27:08] bojackhorseman2004: @MrScotticus so her wanting to help us at the end to defeat zoval isnt that??
[1:27:10] shamethehomegame: they made a nice hut with a pile of moldy blocks and actual feces, so yeah, it is impressive how we pulled out of SL
[1:27:17] bojackhorseman2004: and the whole split soul BS
[1:27:35] HSAyril: Neither because 5d chess and the SL story besides Sylv. was just awful
[1:27:38] bojackhorseman2004: the split soul was such cringe and thats on the shadowlands story writers
[1:27:47] DragnosiOfNede: DragnosiOfNede subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Helllllllo Tali!  Uhh, what did I just walk into??
[1:27:48] Scarto22: I know he was handed a bad situation but at the end it was shit
[1:27:53] Just_Wretch: I don't agree it's was the best possible resolution but I don't hate it tbh
[1:27:53] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel I am curious... What makes Sylvanas more Valuable than Varian? Conaisering that Varian was apparently someone they could remove, but Sylvanas isn't? What, is that the power of boobs? Or is it purely because of Varian and Vol'jin being killed earlier?
[1:28:00] Vampirslayer: @TaliesinAndEvitel  i know this is off topic but why you got shoes on the sofa behind you?
[1:28:03] ka_gu_ra: the best they possibly could have done with Sylvanas. Which is only part of the whole story @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:28:05] aeson_of_raid_sock: that’s like being upset about 100% on a test
[1:28:10] thunduz: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco for @dragnosiofnede
[1:28:15] ShadowDragon14855: morning all
[1:28:15] MrScotticus: @bojackhorseman2004 Nope, they go out of their way to say she's overall bad. Bad people can still try to do things to undo some of the bad they did. That doesn't make them not bad
[1:28:18] Nulgar: imagine the plane captain being incapacitated, some random passenger helps bring the plane down with everyone alive, and then the other passengers give them shit for not taking them to their original destination
[1:28:25] GameingAspect: eiyaDance
[1:28:31] moonkinny: shadowland also had a pandemic to contend with
[1:28:36] cosmicblood84: THE MAN TOOK A SHIT SANDWICH AND MADE IT EDIBLE @TaliesinAndEvitel WHATS WRONG WITH THAT
[1:28:36] ka_gu_ra: the best they possibly could have done with Sylvanas. Which is only part of the whole story @TaliesinAndEvitel

[1:28:51] kambion210: kambion210 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[1:28:53] ivashkov92: @holocroncoder Yesss, please!
[1:28:58] tastytictacs: shadowlands was set up for failure in a million different ways, but here we are
[1:29:02] KeyouiX: it was the best possible resolution but i still didn't like it, i just recognize it could've been way worse, which yea the writing team deserves praise for the salvage work they did
[1:29:07] markaud23: @TenWin that's such a shit question
[1:29:07] ka_gu_ra: @TenWin less figures sold. less coplay. less legasy
[1:29:07] ivashkov92: Alliance villian arc would be coll
[1:29:08] cosmicblood84: LADY PARTS
[1:29:12] KyleS07: She's HOT
[1:29:15] HSAyril: Slack for the shit story he was given, no slack for the terrible writing he did have control over
[1:29:19] moonkinny: I want sylvannas in my bed at midnight not varian
[1:29:23] Noznatation: Sylvannas is prob. the most valued one besides thrall
[1:29:25] bojackhorseman2004: @MrScotticus no, she was bad becuse her soul was plit and then she returns her soul shard BS and now shes not bad. Its horrible writing and trying to redeem her instead of embracing her as a villan. She could been fullon villan evil and lived. But the shadowlands devs just took a massive shit and called it a day
[1:29:26] atamala: big titty goth gf energy
[1:29:26] witchhobbit: @moonkinny i also think that was a factor but people don't care LUL
[1:29:28] GameingAspect: lol
[1:29:29] thunduz: I would think it’s because the plan was always to have Varian be replaced by An Do Win
[1:29:30] Nulgar: lol, first pic is like "I wanna prove Tali right so hard"
[1:29:32] HSAyril: He's better because boobs?
[1:29:33] DragnosiOfNede: I hate to say.... I actually liked the story of Shadowlands and am not thrilled that the core story line there will likely be relegated to the dust bin and never finished :(
[1:29:37] HSAyril: Shes*
[1:29:41] cosmicblood84: LADY PARTS
[1:29:43] KeyouiX: the fact you had to add "wow" says it all
[1:29:51] theszoti: there is a sylvanas boob mouse pad, while there isn't a varian boob mouse pad
[1:29:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin because men don't have BOOBIES
[1:29:59] plopsmurf: They should have kept the story more grounded, not Travel to a new dimensions, have Sylvannes control the undead people she murdered in BFA through the helm of domination and then we try kill her after BFA
[1:30:02] ArkyteCurse: ArkyteCurse subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! Danuser really turned the game around with dragonflight. the game was ready to die after shadowlands and it all hinged on dragonflight. love or hate the guy he played a major role in saving wow
[1:30:02] moonkinny: I liked shadowlands better than dragonflight.  but was stuck at home
[1:30:06] MrScotticus: @bojackhorseman2004 No, in that scene Sylvanus specifically says the soul split wasn't why she did evil stuff. You just didn't pay attention
[1:30:07] dotonbori: FACTS AND KNOWLEDGE
[1:30:11] tastytictacs: @neverbornlucky wellllllllllllllll
[1:30:13] Nightgale96: Hot Goth Mommy PogChamp
[1:30:15] lynscribe: Varian is SO hot tho, like PLEASE I need some fan service for the girls and gays
[1:30:18] HSAyril: I want my warrior women covered in plate
[1:30:19] KyleS07: She's hot and was an old lore character before WoW. She sells merch.
[1:30:19] Tokryva: because of toxic masculinity!?
[1:30:20] GameingAspect: becuse her back story?
[1:30:21] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel I am talking from a story wise plotpoint... This just proves that the execs are creeps.
[1:30:22] cosmicblood84: MEN PLAY THE GAME
[1:30:25] Haretic: Goth Elf?
[1:30:25] HolocronCoder: Not complaining, but sylvanas's thighs in that pic be hella thicc
[1:30:27] plopsmurf: They should have kept the story more grounded, not Travel to a new dimensions, have Sylvannes control the undead people she murdered in BFA through the helm of domination and then we try kill her after BFA. This would not need a Jailer.
[1:30:28] Montbivault: +Varian had a son
[1:30:31] mythryllpala: There were too many Greek names in Shadowlands for me not to like the expansion
[1:30:32] Melinyel1: Sylvanas FUCKING ROCKS
[1:30:35] moonkinny: good point on varian
[1:30:37] atamala: i wish i could put my finger on it
[1:30:42] ka_gu_ra: it is business after all
[1:30:43] maplelost: gotta cover her up like alexstraza
[1:30:43] witchhobbit: sairaLUL
[1:30:46] AngryInternetCat: Guards, stop that handsome wizard!
[1:30:47] Dazzaw17: tagPair tagPair s
[1:30:51] mythryllpala: Yeah she rocks!!
[1:30:52] cosmicblood84: DONT I LL DO IT FOR @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:30:57] markaud23: She is as central to the story as arthas. She is miles above varian. I don't understand this comparison.
[1:30:58] Syzmical: Hot Goth Mommy PogChamp Hot Goth Mommy PogChamp
[1:31:05] Melinyel1: Varian is meh..
[1:31:08] avatos_94: for the same readon alexstrasza is so heavily featured in dragonflight and didn’t die 👀
[1:31:09] mosart: in wrath
[1:31:09] cosmicblood84: SHE HOT HE NOT
[1:31:11] Burnsmh: @TaliesinAndEvitel I hour 30 minutes until I have my phone interview with Blizzard for a Senior Test Analyist II position...Its my dream since I was a kid...I have NEVER been so nervous for a phone call in my entire 34 years of life.
[1:31:12] HolocronCoder: Varian did kinda feel like he popped up out of nowhere, from my personal experience
[1:31:14] KyleS07: @TenWin Absolutely that they're creeps, but so are most men. She's stan'd hard by a large portion of creepy guys on the internet
[1:31:17] DiscordianKitty: Sylvanas should be compared to someone like Thrall, someone else from Warcraft III. And I suspect they can't kill Thrall either
[1:31:18] djalminnha: who varyian?
[1:31:28] skeletonetiquette: Varian has value in death with Anduin. Sylvanas has zero value when she's dead
[1:31:28] djalminnha: Sylvanas was in war3
[1:31:29] tastytictacs: @plopsmurf i think there's a point in showing the emerald dream and shadowlands and how theyve gone to shit. Amirdrassil was very on the nose about Nymue "ordering the emerald dream."
[1:31:29] JMan31337: Varian was a meh Arthas replacement
[1:31:39] Syzmical: wow players are coomers is the answer
[1:31:41] cosmicblood84: HE HOT TOO BUT NOT HER KIND OF HOT
[1:31:43] moonkinny: and great hair
[1:31:48] mythryllpala: @burnsmh good luck!!
[1:31:54] tastytictacs: @Syzmical amen
[1:31:55] vlaovich88: Varian died to elevate another character that has been building for a long time. There would not be that for Sylvanas
[1:31:56] Burnsmh: @mythryllpala Thank you!!
[1:31:56] Just_Wretch: Having read the slyv book and her convo with the jailer there was a promise of a story tgat I'm not sure it's possible to narrate in game tbh
[1:32:00] bojackhorseman2004: what is more important Sylvanas as a character or a good storyline? hmm wonder what
[1:32:03] witchhobbit: yuP
[1:32:05] DragnosiOfNede: Wow... Myffanwy... you've changed ;)
[1:32:18] mythryllpala: @vlaovich88 correct!!
[1:32:22] Nikeisha: even from a female point of view she's more relatable - she was screwed over and has shit to deal with lol.  I've played since TBC and can't really remember anything about him other than his death
[1:32:22] Theorof: Besides all this, we need to discuss the really important issue. The T&E channel's sickening lack of murloc emotes. Outrageous!
[1:32:27] theszoti: and anduin was also technically around for longer than varian
[1:32:28] MeggoArt: my question is why they were allowed to kill arthas and not sylvanas. they make wayyy more arthas merch
[1:32:29] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Sure. But by that logic should the lich king never have been able to die either? Because, lets be fair here... Sylvanas is maybe recognizable.. Arthas literally is an icon.
[1:32:30] plopsmurf: @tastytictacs true but it should be like Argus in a patch of an expansion. They could have revived the old world and keep the game more grounded and return to Azaroth
[1:32:32] itchidude: and Tyrion too
[1:32:34] cosmicblood84: the king is mention in classic like 3 times
[1:32:44] markaud23: Villians can die
[1:32:49] tastytictacs: @plopsmurf oh ya, it wasn
[1:32:53] doomer_dan_: RIP my man Vol'jin. Best warchief
[1:32:57] avatos_94: cause 20years ago?
[1:32:59] mosart: I don't think they would've killed Arthas if wrath came out today
[1:33:02] MeggoArt: arthas.... died in wrath?
[1:33:02] Just_Wretch: Arthas was designed from beginning to be killed
[1:33:04] cosmicblood84: in oyxia story line
[1:33:05] theszoti: arthas is like the darth vader of wow
[1:33:07] cosmicblood84: in game
[1:33:13] moonkinny: wow was being created at the same time as Warcraft 3
[1:33:13] bojackhorseman2004: Arthas dies in WC3? HUH?
[1:33:14] TenWin: Arthas is also super tragic
[1:33:17] tastytictacs: @plopsmurf ya i  dont think it was told very well, but i believe that's the point of going to both those places
[1:33:20] dday_movies: arthas was a villain ripe for final boss status before WoW even started
[1:33:23] markaud23: Arthas is a prototypical raid boss, this conversation...
[1:33:25] Noznatation: With a huge redemption arc
[1:33:30] Nulgar: @MeggoArt tbh the early WoW expansions killed off too many villains too quickly, and from Cata onward, people complained that any new villain wasn't introduced in WC3 or earlier, therefore bad
[1:33:31] TenWin: Arthas and Sylvanas are mirrors of each other. One just have boobs.
[1:33:38] vlaovich88: Before Shadowlands, Arthas was already dead and not coming back. So killing him again didn't really impact much.
[1:33:55] DiscordianKitty: You'd probably find they can't kill Thrall either - and it felt a little like they wanted to at one point
[1:33:57] Syzmical: #ArthasWasRight
[1:33:59] TenWin: So does Sylvanas post Frozen throne?
[1:33:59] moonkinny: in shadowlands arthas should have come back
[1:34:01] JMan31337: Arthas was made to be a Hero that lived long enough to become a Villain
[1:34:15] plopsmurf: @tastytictacs I mean have the shadowlands, the afterlife, as a patch of the expansion after BFA
[1:34:17] CeasiusPls: he lost agency when he took the sword
[1:34:21] itchidude: did he have agency after picking up the sword?
[1:34:22] dday_movies: Arthas is Anakin Skywalker. Sylvanis is a victim of his
[1:34:31] valianya: My issues with Shadowlands aren't even the Sylvanas storyline so much.  It's the way Shadowlands ditched and distanced itself from everything tying the story to Azeroth.  They didn't visit any of the afterlives that were directly tied to central NPCs and player races that would give emotional attachment for the players.  The NPCs we did see in the afterlives are almost completely divorced of their previous lives.
[1:34:36] daodjinn: ilidan has done the same lvl of evil acts as arthas as we saw in legion and yett he s not "evil"
[1:34:36] valianya: And basically replacing the Titans with 'bigger and better Titans' aka the First Ones.
[1:34:51] itchidude: did he know that would happen though?
[1:34:54] Nulgar: @vlaovich88 Arthas didn't even "come back" in SL, he was mentioned, parts of his already ripped-apart soul were used for the sword, but that's it. I just don't understand people complaining that it "ruined" the character when it barely touched him and did nothing _to_ him.
[1:34:56] djalminnha: sword was final nail in the coffin
[1:35:03] AngryInternetCat: He chose toburn Stratholme before Frostmourne
[1:35:03] Arlaeya: Culling of Stratholm.
[1:35:04] cosmicblood84: LETS BE HONEST SYLVANAS AND ILLIDAN ARE 2 BEST MONEY MAKERS EST ARTHAS IS OUT OF STORY
[1:35:05] MeggoArt: i'm just thinkin merch sales and characters they could have kept milking for more dollars. they could have had him stick around to be the big bad for three more expacs and most gamers probably wouldn't be tired of him
[1:35:09] itchidude: ah okay
[1:35:10] Nickystr1x: what sword?
[1:35:13] moonkinny: the first ones will be replace by The Really first ones
[1:35:13] BeornSoftpaw: Sylvanas was ever a good person, but manipulated by the wrong people
[1:35:14] Syzmical: the implications are Yogg'Saron really was enticing him however
[1:35:16] Nulgar: yep, Arthas was gone by Stratholme already
[1:35:18] tastytictacs: @Nickystr1x frostmourne
[1:35:18] cosmicblood84: YOUR RIGHT
[1:35:20] Just_Wretch: @valianya the lakeshore story was pretty good tho
[1:35:22] GoldSmog: he was a cunt before he grabbed the sword tbh
[1:35:24] Ealdfox: Muradin "Sword is cursed, don't do it!!!" Arthas "Imma do it"
[1:35:28] cosmicblood84: DONT TOUCH IT
[1:35:33] Nickystr1x: @tastytictacs i know, i was just doing the what sword? bit
[1:35:34] JMan31337: I think the sword even warns him at some point
[1:35:37] dday_movies: by the time Arthas even touches the sword, he’d already purged a whole city. Dude was already far gone by that point
[1:35:38] cosmicblood84: IM GOING TOUCH THE SWORD
[1:35:41] tastytictacs: @JMan31337 oh lmao
[1:35:41] JordanWoollen: Muradin practically threw hands to keep him from picking it up.
[1:35:45] ka_gu_ra: Arthas looses agency only because of The Jailer
[1:35:49] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel i would have loved if arthas came back and was on the "to malicious and evil to die" kinda like azshara was. theres a charm in villains that are around our power scale (instead of cosmic entities)
[1:35:53] CeasiusPls: it was retconned when the jailer was introduced imo
[1:35:54] itz_killjoy: Hey stranger, im heading to  northrend, Stranger: don't pick up the sword LUL
[1:35:56] vlaovich88: @nulgar very much agree with that
[1:35:57] TenWin: I am just saying, that Sylvanas was set up as an anti-villain from frozent hrone onwards. And has, since vanilla, been a clear mirror to Arthas actions and his fall. Sylvanas dying makes equal amount of sense to Arthas dying. It is just because the execs are creeps that rely on selling big boobs. :P @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:36:02] cosmicblood84: DONT TOUCH THAT HELMET
[1:36:06] AngryInternetCat: At the end of Frozen Throne, he disobeys Ner'Zul
[1:36:12] neverbornlucky: men are never controlled ONLY WOMEN
[1:36:17] cosmicblood84: IM GOING TO TOUCH THAT HELMET
[1:36:22] AngryInternetCat: Thats how he becomes the Lich King
[1:36:25] moonkinny: Azeroth is a prison
[1:36:27] tastytictacs: @neverbornlucky er anduin
[1:36:28] markaud23: @TenWin clear mirror? in vanilla?
[1:36:37] cosmicblood84: HE DOSE IT 2 TIMES
[1:36:41] Nickystr1x: yeah but arthas controls his own decisions and hes a man so its the same cause theyre both controlled by a man
[1:36:46] KyleS07: He kept mementos of his past life. He had agency. The sword was hurting him and he had to harvest souls and had to harvest souls to survive. But he could've dropped the sword at any time.
[1:36:52] Noznatation: The sword just work like alchohol, it just makes him do what he already would :)
[1:36:54] jennybean0: It was to "show her"
[1:36:55] moonkinny: he had to be because the jailor did it
[1:37:04] CeasiusPls: I understood W3, I may have misunderstand the recontextualization the Shadowlands introduced
[1:37:05] TenWin: @markaud23 Have you read any of the quests that forsaken does in Vanilla? Their morality is most of the time at best grey... frequently evil. On syvlanas orders. Sylvanas is morally grey at BEST...
[1:37:08] jennybean0: Like this is for being annoying
[1:37:09] ivashkov92: @nulgar 💯 agree!! It’s crazy so many people think Arthas  was ruined in SL when he was only mentioned through out the story.
[1:37:10] Syzmical: Arthas was swayed by Yogg'saron cannonically, however he made all the GIGACHAD decisions himself
[1:37:16] Ealdfox: There's even a book explaining all this
[1:37:33] markaud23: @TenWin yeah, the forsaken have morally-gray aspects. That's not a mirror to arthas though.
[1:37:35] khandee: Everyone says the Jailer was a fortune teller, but if you have ever had a long-term plan, you know you adjust your plan according to the changing landscape. I am not defending the Jailer/Shadowlands - but that critique is silly.
[1:37:35] cosmicblood84: HE  TOLD NOT TO DO THINGS AND PICKS UP SWORD AND HELMET ARTHAS DID IT HIMSELF
[1:37:36] dday_movies: Arthas is literally Anakin becoming Vader. He knows what he’s doing, started out with noble intentions, but crosses too many moral lines and eventually becomes fully corrupted by his own actions. the sword is just part of that.
[1:37:41] HazMatt_Prime: Even if you think he doesn't have agency, he still sacked Stratholme and murdered the mercenaries and burned the boats of his soldiers. He was doing fucked up things from the start.
[1:37:45] moonkinny: it is fact I know steve
[1:37:53] DrGreatScott: Oh boy what have I walked into?
[1:37:59] HolocronCoder: @dday_movies Agree
[1:38:05] tastytictacs: @dday_movies nuh uh. stop comparing wow lore to other well told stories
[1:38:06] KyleS07: Yogg had nothing to do witth Arthas. Ner'Zhul did. But he still CHOSE to be the Lich King and rip out his own heart.
[1:38:10] cosmicblood84: SLAPS FACE FACE PLAM
[1:38:16] moonkinny: because it’s funny to annoy you
[1:38:18] cosmicblood84: JAYSUS
[1:38:23] ivashkov92: haha troll
[1:38:24] Deatheran: arthas was manipulated. sylvanas was meat puppeted no?
[1:38:26] ivashkov92: 🧌
[1:38:43] markaud23: exactly
[1:38:51] tastytictacs: @Deatheran conrolled by arthas, manipulated by the jailer
[1:38:51] Ganryu22: i am lost. The Echo guild is similar to what?
[1:38:53] TenWin: @Deatheran After being freed in Frozen throne she had free will, so not relaly?
[1:38:54] cosmicblood84: @TaliesinAndEvitel  I UNDERSTAND YOU IF OTHERS DONT HERE
[1:38:56] Insivius: Not a fan of echo in the story, I much prefer liquid
[1:38:57] KyleS07: Sylvanas didn't choose to be ripped from her body and made a banshee. She made the best of her situation.
[1:39:01] DrGreatScott: [Insert George Lucas quote about poetry rhyming]
[1:39:07] ka_gu_ra: @ivashkov92 Jailer didn't exist at WC3 time
[1:39:13] itz_killjoy: @dday_movies did you not see arthas spirit speaking to his father? hes not evil at all
[1:39:19] Eregbueye: @Insivius hahAA
[1:39:21] cosmicblood84: 100% RIGHT TALIE
[1:39:23] brennibrennt: Tali please do a video "Explain me WoW's story as if I'm 10"
[1:39:24] moonkinny: metzen is the jailor
[1:39:34] cosmicblood84: WTF
[1:39:37] Sch1ey: sch1eyBlink
[1:39:41] neverbornlucky: Taliesin she's a woman its all about BDSM with her control
[1:39:48] cosmicblood84: WOW
[1:39:48] Ganryu22: You are saying women do not have the agency to decide. So not 2024
[1:39:50] MikeyGy: some people in this chat  are so  dense its unreal...
[1:39:52] cosmicblood84: FUCK ME
[1:39:52] Tokryva: Hitler did in the end kill Hitler so
[1:39:53] Arlaeya: Arthas was ALWAYS an ass. he got worse.
[1:39:57] cosmicblood84: WOW
[1:39:57] Deatheran: acting like evil motherfuckers cant have positive emotions towards others
[1:39:57] Insivius: Shiny golden boy do nothing wrong, blame big bad orc instead
[1:40:07] AngryInternetCat: Sylvanas does kind of murder Garithos, though, but he was an arse
[1:40:08] tastytictacs: @Arlaeya fr. culling of stratholme. it's literally right there
[1:40:08] itchidude: @TaliesinAndEvitel how did they know the sword would corrupt him, was it wielded by someone before. i dont know the story that well
[1:40:15] GameingAspect: f
[1:40:17] Ganryu22: And women should live at the stone age. Great
[1:40:17] KyleS07: He was sentimental. He was cursed. But he chose to kill people and raise them
[1:40:19] rezion_43: small F
[1:40:19] MrScotticus: You're back
[1:40:19] Theorof: F
[1:40:19] Nulgar: you#re back
[1:40:20] HSAyril: No
[1:40:20] GameingAspect: oh you bk
[1:40:20] Harai_Ulfsark: back
[1:40:20] vlaovich88: You are back
[1:40:21] Insivius: you're back
[1:40:21] ourmanyfans: Arthas culled Strathome but he's a goodie though
[1:40:22] elbardo_ts: no tali you're not here
[1:40:22] lynscribe: youre back
[1:40:23] cosmicblood84: I SEE YOU
[1:40:23] HolocronCoder: You came back
[1:40:23] moonkinny: you are back
[1:40:23] Deatheran: ohh hthats an F
[1:40:24] Pinochino89: Arthas is the same as Anakin. They made the decision to take the dark route to reach their goals.
[1:40:26] Silencbank: disconnect momentarily
[1:40:29] DrGreatScott: Having a moment of clarity before you die isn't a sign of being good
[1:40:31] ravenstarr: it was just for a sec
[1:40:31] Silencbank: you back
[1:40:32] Nulgar: only gone for a few seconds
[1:40:36] dday_movies: Arthas is Anakin/Vader. “is it over?” is like Vader talking to Luke without the mask, just without any redemption lol
[1:40:37] Tokryva: I instant got worried I was banned for mentioning some historic dickshit ScaredyCat
[1:40:38] neverbornlucky: FINALLY we know the truth about blizzard and tentacles Taliesin they love BDSM  She is a prime example
[1:40:39] moonkinny: I thought you banned me lol
[1:40:39] cosmicblood84: NICE FUCKING TMOG
[1:40:44] cosmicblood84: BTW
[1:40:44] Arlaeya: nice to his dad that he KILLED
[1:40:44] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel Sylvanas doesn't choose to become undead, sure. But post frozen throne, where she breaks free from the control? Oh, she 100% had choices what she did on that point forwards. She was made undead by arthas, true. BUT nothing about her forced her to allow the creation of blight. Nothing about her forced her to invade gilneas. Nothing about her forced her to being tricked by the jailor. And then willingly (for a purpose) doing evil things.
[1:41:03] Syzmical: tali loves the chatters who love a good debate
[1:41:07] tastytictacs: @TenWin well she was tricked and manipulated by the jailer
[1:41:16] TalkingWoW: Alright Tali m8, hope you got that hole in the ceiling fixed! talkin67Love
[1:41:17] GameingAspect: jumps off right?
[1:41:18] KyleS07: She was good from that point.
[1:41:19] moonkinny: gets killed in for the alliance
[1:41:20] big_scoo: the story tellers didnt do us any favors. It is pretty confusing for people who dont read the books or play the warcraft games.
[1:41:22] tastytictacs: still her decision, but under false pretenses
[1:41:23] HazMatt_Prime: She kills that racist alliance commander....oh no
[1:41:27] KyleS07: A hero for her people.
[1:41:32] KeyouiX: she kills herself right?
[1:41:37] itchidude: @TaliesinAndEvitel  how did they know the sword would corrupt him, was it wielded by someone before? i dont know the story that well
[1:41:41] HSAyril: Doesn't "is it over?" Show at least some aspect of lack of control?
[1:41:54] TenWin: From frozent hrone onwards, she takes over lordaron, uses blight, raises dead, kills survivors, etc etc.
[1:41:58] Ganryu22: Kinda like me with a bag of bacon chips, we all know we are fooling ourselves by thinking we can resist
[1:42:04] Deatheran: debate? time to warm up the debatebro muscles.
[1:42:05] cosmicblood84: no way
[1:42:07] KatieRet_: Then what's over?
[1:42:11] elbardo_ts: now you dc
[1:42:11] Syzmical: F
[1:42:12] HolocronCoder: F
[1:42:12] Trebled_Mind: Rip
[1:42:13] HSAyril: I thought it showed a relief of his position
[1:42:14] ka_gu_ra: o7
[1:42:15] elbardo_ts: back
[1:42:16] Shanhayde: oh F again D:
[1:42:16] HolocronCoder: And back
[1:42:16] Insivius: She doesn't really do anything in warcraft 3 but try to kill arthas after she turns into a banshee
[1:42:17] moonkinny: come back
[1:42:17] Syzmical: unF
[1:42:17] HSAyril: Rip haha
[1:42:20] Nulgar: yeah back
[1:42:22] Nickystr1x: jailer cut the stream
[1:42:23] draxius34: Sylvanas literally slowed down Arthas from getting to SMC. Upon catching her, Sylvanas thought she was dead. However, Arthas was like, "Nope, you slowed me down, and annoyed me. Now you will suffer." Then becomes a banshee
[1:42:27] moonkinny: yeah!
[1:42:28] TenWin: @Insivius She claims Lordaron.
[1:42:35] CeasiusPls: Corruption is a common trope in Warcraft, I'm not exactly sure when someone is supposed to lose agency
[1:42:36] SilverkissTwitch: Tali can't argue so keeps pretending to disconnect Kappa THIS IS A JOKE
[1:42:36] aurum2509: I read “is it over” more as “am I going to die”
[1:42:38] TenWin: Yes, I would say it is evil to take over Lordaron from the survivors.
[1:42:44] Syzmical: Jailor preordained stream would crash
[1:42:48] reklum_: looks like someone at twitch doesn't agree with you Tali hahaha
[1:42:51] ourmanyfans: Metzen out to get you for speaking the truth about Sylvanas
[1:42:57] KyleS07: @TenWin She leads them.
[1:42:59] jennybean0: She was mad about what she was made to do so shes the baddie
[1:42:59] AngryInternetCat: She killer Garithos, though
[1:43:03] Ganryu22: just ugly ones
[1:43:04] KeyouiX: @TenWin she took it over FOR the survivors
[1:43:04] raiel1569: Burning Teldrassil was the inflection point in her choices, I think before that it was more survival of the forsaken.
[1:43:06] DrGreatScott: Frozen Throne-Wrath was build up an army for revenge against Arthas. Cata-sometime before BFA was a bid for survival of their people
[1:43:06] tastytictacs: @KatieRet_ a lot of people are remorseful at the time of their death
[1:43:11] HSAyril: Because they're ugly
[1:43:15] AngryInternetCat: Oh, yes, thats true
[1:43:16] moonkinny: I remember that too
[1:43:17] PoisonedLoaf: Yup
[1:43:18] DragnosiOfNede: Yep.
[1:43:18] KyleS07: In the Arthas book, she litteraly is the reasson the foresaken exist.
[1:43:20] magemaster225: calia does, sylvanas doesnt
[1:43:21] whisperlude: The alliance literally outcasted them
[1:43:22] Noznatation: She tries yea - but even before she does she expects to be turned down
[1:43:22] TenWin: She tries to make peace with the alliance, sure... after slaughtering anyone remaining in Lordaron due to Garithos being removed.
[1:43:22] DragnosiOfNede: No, you're not wrong.
[1:43:23] cosmicblood84: your right
[1:43:24] AngryInternetCat: I forgot that
[1:43:26] KeyouiX: Graithos or whatever fucked things up for her
[1:43:28] aurum2509: actually she kills Gerithos she doesn’t try to join
[1:43:28] ourmanyfans: No you're right
[1:43:29] seanstrachan: She literally helps the very people that Arthas had made into meat puppets
[1:43:29] Nulgar: nope, she comes to the Alliance with a peace offering, and they literally almost kill her
[1:43:29] ka_gu_ra: @HSAyril and smell
[1:43:32] khalcrux_gaming: The Alliance is racist
[1:43:36] moonkinny: your memory is better than afrasabi s
[1:43:37] HSAyril: UGLY
[1:43:42] ivashkov92: When did she do that?
[1:43:43] DrGreatScott: You're right, she sent diplomats who where excecuted by scourge association
[1:43:44] SkyForged13: I feel that the "Is it over moment" shows a sense of weariness over his decisions, and while he was manipulated into making his terrible decisions, they were ultimately his (Arthas's) choice
[1:43:44] aeson_of_raid_sock: doesn’t she kill the humans who helped clear lordaeron?
[1:43:46] Shanhayde: Sylvanas is rejected by almost everyone, her own people, and try to join humans which reject her too, so she gather Forsaken and get Lordaeron if i remember correctly
[1:43:49] tastytictacs: me when people think alliance r good guys and horde r bad guys
[1:43:50] JMan31337: a lot of people forget about the Illidan and Arthas battle in Northrend just like the fact that Arthas made Sylvanas as torture
[1:43:51] ourmanyfans: @ivashkov92 Vanilla
[1:43:54] Shanhayde: She's the one that decided to do good indeed
[1:43:54] cosmicblood84: why think called foressken
[1:43:58] KyleS07: @TenWin The Foresaken existed because she broke free from Arthas' control.
[1:44:00] TenWin: Doesn't change she slaughterd Garithos forces and Survivors in Lordaron. Not trying to maintain peace with them.
[1:44:02] ivashkov92: Ahhh. it’s been years lol
[1:44:04] cosmicblood84: jesus
[1:44:10] ivashkov92: I don’t recall that
[1:44:13] Nickystr1x: @TaliesinAndEvitel not saying this to disagree with your per se but it's important to note that she did kinda hope the peace thing would fail
[1:44:17] Arlaeya: The Forsaken are the Forsaken because they were Forsaken by their own people
[1:44:25] seanstrachan: @tenwin did you think Garithos was good...?
[1:44:27] HazMatt_Prime: Then she met Garithos....remember when the Alliance were assholes?
[1:44:27] bucephalos: The first TFT mission was killing all people trying to flee from lordaeron why would they make peace with her xD
[1:44:32] bitter5weet: 24 raiders from bitter5weet have joined! 
[1:44:33] AngryInternetCat: Garithos was really bad. An arse
[1:44:34] TenWin: @seanstrachan Obviously not. But the point remain.
[1:44:34] DragnosiOfNede: Here's a better question... What GIT said no to THAT???
[1:44:37] HSAyril: Tali someone told me to microwave my water for tea instead of boiling it and I gotta say I kinda like it better
[1:44:38] KeyouiX: garithos was trying to kill her
[1:44:38] tastytictacs: WAR IN MY WARCRAFT?
[1:44:40] djalminnha: Tali did u red Sylvanas novel?
[1:44:42] moonkinny: ambiguity was always wow strength
[1:44:45] draxius34: Ner'zhul was inside the sword, Frostmourn. He definitely whispered and suggested evil deeds to Arthas, but Arthas was just pissed at Sylvanas so he wanted to make her suffer.
[1:44:47] TenWin: Slaughtering forces just for being there is still an evil act, no matter what.
[1:44:52] Saevash: @taliesinandevitel i also appreciate how bold they took arthas character they could have milked one of the most influential character in the game and instead they chose to move on
[1:45:03] DrGreatScott: Wasn't Garithos like super racist?
[1:45:05] TenWin: For a good reason.
[1:45:11] anistrasza: if we are going to thank sylvanas is mad  for trying to protect her people and giving them back their home then but Arthas isnt bad. that is CRAZY
[1:45:11] Shanhayde: @DrGreatScott yeah, he was
[1:45:12] Akashicbunny: This entire story arc is very good at illustrating that life is grey.  No side is all good or all bad
[1:45:14] itchidude: we still do BABY
[1:45:15] KyleS07: @TenWin They were defending themselves and their home.
[1:45:16] tastytictacs: I CANNOT believe two groups of people fought in WoW
[1:45:17] Noznatation: It wasn't good, but that doesn't means it is evil.
[1:45:18] HSAyril: Ugly
[1:45:19] KeyouiX: think tenwin just hates forsaken
[1:45:21] AngryInternetCat: They worked together for a while
[1:45:21] TenWin: @DrGreatScott Sure. Doesn't change that she slaughtered his forces.
[1:45:24] moonkinny: I think we should call the giant sword World Mourn.  I want a life size replica in the shop
[1:45:25] cosmicblood84: she dose some evil shit forske of forsaken
[1:45:25] khalcrux_gaming: Not for good reason
[1:45:30] TenWin: @KeyouiX #MainsAForsaken
[1:45:32] Ealdfox: Garithos was "Thanks for the help, now fuck off" and she killed him
[1:45:32] Katyger: "dead and ugly" lololol
[1:45:32] tastytictacs: @TenWin cause they didn't like them either?
[1:45:35] Ganryu22: How can they kill the guys who are already dead?
[1:45:37] DeadlyKitten17: I think people forget that part about Sylvanas. that she became a champion/protector of a people who broke free from control against their will.
[1:45:37] Ganryu22: I am lost
[1:45:37] Xannah08: Was there a cutscene or anything of Sylvannas death in wrath? I always missed that part.
[1:45:37] GameingAspect: tht aint evil
[1:45:41] MaddSeazyn: Garithos was suiper racist and if I recall he pushed the Blood Elves towards the Horde
[1:45:41] moonkinny: I am with you talie self defense is ok
[1:45:50] khalcrux_gaming: Some humans bad...we should kill all humans for good reason
[1:45:52] cosmicblood84: its not evil to retake your homeland
[1:45:55] Kortinas: Defending yourself is evil coded? Hmm
[1:45:57] tastytictacs: @TenWin ur an alliance apologist?
[1:45:59] GameingAspect: thr allaice are evil also
[1:46:01] KeyouiX: @TenWin than its surprising you hate your own faction
[1:46:07] moonkinny: yes talie
[1:46:07] ivashkov92: Ya can’t say that’s evil
[1:46:13] DrGreatScott: That's why Before the Storm hits so hard
[1:46:15] seanstrachan: Garithos didn't just shit on Forsaken as well he wanted to slaughter the blood elves that were near extinction thanks to Arthas. She stopped another evil.
[1:46:15] TenWin: And after taking Lordaron, she authorized production of blight? BEcause that is totally a non-evil act.
[1:46:18] PoisonedLoaf: Indeed
[1:46:21] hitchmeister59: It's not so empty if there are soldiers there to kill them.
[1:46:25] Nickystr1x: they literally say "beware the living"
[1:46:28] markaud23: yes, back to the arthas comparison.
[1:46:34] doomer_dan_: Warcraft humans are typically pretty terrible and bigoted people
[1:46:40] JMan31337: the forsaken is like a civil war story
[1:46:40] KyleS07: @TenWin That's skipping a lot of stuff and many years inbetween.
[1:46:40] moonkinny: go do the forsaken beginning in wow.  they are victoms
[1:46:48] Kortinas: @doomer_dan_ right lmao
[1:46:56] TenWin: And then killed every living person in Lordaron to make space for her own. JUST like Arthas did. XD
[1:46:57] raiel1569: But at that point do the lorderon humans know the forsaken had free will?
[1:47:06] draxius34: @taliesinandevitel I think Lordaeron was emptied when Arthas came back to take the throne, and murdered his father
[1:47:08] TenWin: @KyleS07 4 years, but yes.
[1:47:08] Shanhayde: @doomer_dan_ because most of them are manipulated by Deathwing, not to excuse them, they still are pieces of shit haha
[1:47:11] Deatheran: some of them i think they even had a name, werre actualy evil and wanted to kill all humans and convert them? but that was an old plot i think a dread lord was involved
[1:47:12] markaud23: not just like arthas.
[1:47:13] cosmicblood84: next your tell british are evil for try take back 13 coloney in revlotionary war @TaliesinAndEvitel  by his standards
[1:47:14] KyleS07: @TenWin Are you trying to tell the narrative that Horde is bad guys?
[1:47:15] tastytictacs: @TenWin cause they wouldnt let them back home
[1:47:17] TenWin: This is fun. :3
[1:47:20] Thoreya: lol
[1:47:22] moonkinny: bring back the true feel of the forsaken.  not that sylvannas et al are evil
[1:47:27] Kortinas: I agree
[1:47:28] Noznatation: Which is why the whole mass murdering thing just feels so far away from the character. Facking alex :D
[1:47:32] MaddSeazyn: Before she went insane, the Forsaken Sylvanas raised were given the choice on if they wanted to live or return to death.
[1:47:33] HSAyril: For good reason
[1:47:36] KyleS07: @TenWin That is not what she did at all.
[1:47:39] DragnosiOfNede: Yeah, there's a reason Anduin is such a central creature in the Alliance story because he's trying to redeem the human spirit
[1:47:43] moonkinny: forsaken were oppressed
[1:47:44] tastytictacs: @TenWin You are incredibly adamant given you only regurgitate half a story
[1:47:54] moonkinny: and I have never played forsaken
[1:47:56] ivashkov92: hahah
[1:48:10] cosmicblood84: next your tell british are evil for try take back 13 coloney in revlotionary war @TaliesinAndEvitel by standards @TenWin
[1:48:29] thunduz: I mean when we see Zombies we immediately think kill the zombie lol
[1:48:30] ivashkov92: lol
[1:48:34] DragnosiOfNede: Sooo... Were the Native American's who fought back in the 1600s and 1700s... Evil?
[1:48:37] tastytictacs: TenWin is definitely arguing on purpose. They're ignoring literally half the story
[1:48:40] Kortinas: Ooooof
[1:48:45] cosmicblood84: they owned us
[1:48:47] Noznatation: Sylvanas joining the Jailer does seem a bit like Arthas though - which is why it feel so wrong for her to be tempted by him.
[1:48:56] HSAyril: What if they wanted to kill the dead to prevent disease and such
[1:49:01] jennybean0: That thrall guy is super evil cuz he killed those humans in durnhold
[1:49:02] cosmicblood84: she want there land back
[1:49:03] Co1eCash: I dunno man, zombies show up at my door, I don't think I'm asking questions first
[1:49:03] thunduz: 100%
[1:49:04] aeson_of_raid_sock: think of the housing crisis when the inhabitants never die
[1:49:06] Sorin__: fighting colonisers is not the same as just trying to murder your neighbours
[1:49:07] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel sounds like they dont know about that wierd apothicary sub faction within the forsaken those werre the evil ones
[1:49:10] KyleS07: @TenWin Blight production started at without her permission. She authorized it AFTER the LK was killed. From her death to Cata was more than 4 years
[1:49:10] moonkinny: I pretended sylvannas was not part of shadowlands
[1:49:14] Noznatation: ye ye I get that
[1:49:32] doomer_dan_: Sylvanas was dead to me the moment she said "the horde is nothing"
[1:49:35] moonkinny: she was a victim
[1:49:35] Kortinas: Yea for sure
[1:49:35] TenWin: @KyleS07 So she didn't notice the blight production occuring literally underneath her feet
[1:49:36] GameingAspect: they shoujld kiss
[1:49:39] thunduz: Shadowlands ended after we defeated Daddy D. Short expac but a good one
[1:49:45] moonkinny: they are lovets
[1:49:46] KeyouiX: @GameingAspect absolutely not
[1:49:49] moonkinny: lovers
[1:49:49] CrossroadsDealer: has everyone never played the Lillian Voss storyline? her storyline is the best story ever of the tragic life of a risen human in wow. Lillian’s pathos is one of the best stories in all of wow.
[1:49:52] cosmicblood84: yeah there going get on at some point
[1:49:53] seanstrachan: The fact that he reminds her of Lirath :(
[1:49:55] KeyouiX: @moonkinny gross
[1:49:56] ivashkov92: Ya they did a good job with their in game cinematic and such
[1:49:57] Noznatation: Agree - even if it looked cool
[1:50:00] KyleS07: @TenWin The original creator wasn't following her.
[1:50:10] tastytictacs: @TenWin Did you know that people can do shit behind your back?
[1:50:12] RoboticUnicorn007: Aren't Zovals nipples the best thing about Shadowlands?
[1:50:12] maplelost: impressive to make the afterlife boring
[1:50:13] moonkinny: the big problem was burning the tree
[1:50:18] DrGreatScott: @CrossroadsDealer Lillian is peak story telling for the forsaken
[1:50:27] Deatheran: the fact that she calls him "litle lion" made me think at the time... "does she secretly fancy him?
[1:50:29] Dazzaw17: maybe unpopular opinion, but Shadowlands zones are some of the best in the game ( not the maw ofc)
[1:50:37] moonkinny: the zones were cool
[1:50:39] Sharxkin: i actually find myself Nostolgic for BFA
[1:50:41] adam3comp: big true, also i loved nyalotha
[1:50:42] TenWin: @TaliesinAndEvitel 9.0 Should have been an Old God expansion. BFA should have been wholeheartedly focused on the war with the old god stuff being a B-plot. And then have 9.0 be a full old god expansion. Because Shadowlands was a bad call.
[1:50:45] dastago: to me it makes character deaths feel less impactful knowing intimately how the afterlife works
[1:50:48] Nickystr1x: nyalotha day spa
[1:50:54] neverbornlucky: the maw became the dark area
[1:50:59] JMan31337: ny'alotha probably could have made a better expansion
[1:51:03] Syzmical: assuming the black empire was only all void! titan propagandist
[1:51:04] moonkinny: maldraxus rocked
[1:51:08] tastytictacs: @TenWin Too bad we can't time travel
[1:51:10] ourmanyfans: Shadowlands should have just been the maw (as in endgame zone, not aesthetically)
[1:51:11] DrGreatScott: @Deatheran Not romantically, more like her little brother who died if anything
[1:51:13] thunduz: may I disagree to a point? Shadowlands was fun but having the zones not connected was not great, and having NPC's just able to hop back and forth ruined it's mystery
[1:51:17] cosmicblood84: you know there is one thing about shadowland that kind of fuck up @TaliesinAndEvitel  after life is kind of let down
[1:51:20] StingerPlaysGames: the shadowlands is the maw, everything else was excess.
[1:51:37] moonkinny: I loved it
[1:51:44] Dazzaw17: @moonkinny as a Metal head, that zone vibed with me massivley, loved it
[1:51:47] Vunderbrat: yeah, agree
[1:51:49] SamuraiWillZ916: the original warcraft map had it as likr a coatal place or something
[1:51:52] thunduz: yeah can agree with that
[1:51:53] teodrad: Giga W take
[1:52:00] frankenfoot5: Shadowlands is 4 .3 patch zones pieced together with scotch tape and a prayer
[1:52:01] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you know you miss the maw
[1:52:10] DrGreatScott: On the inverse, should Argus have been a full expac or at least 2 patches?
[1:52:10] ivashkov92: Yeah, the disconnection of the zones was sucky to me. it made the world feel a bit smaller
[1:52:13] Ganryu22: problem of shadowlands was that the biggest boss is a random dude no one givesa crap about
[1:52:19] thunduz: 100% Jailor shouldn't have been around. Daddy D should have been the big bad
[1:52:23] bomayaa: who wanted or was excited by shadowlands? watching from afar at the time I was like, I'm glad I left during BFA
[1:52:23] moonkinny: killing all the night elves wrecked Warcraft
[1:52:31] maplelost: they do? isnt it in the books
[1:52:42] adam3comp: i mean i was crying while i watched it but like
[1:52:53] thunduz: Sylvanas working with Daddy D would have been so damn good
[1:52:58] ivashkov92: I would say that the several realms of the shadowlands is a concept I like. Revendreth is one of my favorite zones they’ve ever done.
[1:53:18] ivashkov92: And a zone that would never be able to exist in a typical on Azeroth expansion
[1:53:20] SkyForged13: I mean, the Jailor's ultimate goal was very weak narratively because it introduced the First Ones and yet another random threat without any setup or rationale ahead of time
[1:53:24] cosmicblood84: shadowlands is like dying and find out heaven is  getto trailer park @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:53:39] moonkinny: it wasn’t heaven
[1:53:39] thunduz: Do you think if the jailor and Daddy D's roles reversed we would have had a more interesting story?
[1:53:43] DrGreatScott: Daddynathrius was the best part of Shadowlands
[1:53:52] frankenfoot5: Wait a second, did Sylvanas ever do something with the bargain from Helya?
[1:53:54] CrossroadsDealer: yes we needed a flashback of him convincing het
[1:54:00] CrossroadsDealer: her*
[1:54:00] frankenfoot5: I genuinely cannot remember how that paid off
[1:54:02] Noznatation: Would just have been so easier to believe any other character getting tempted by the Jailer.
[1:54:03] ivashkov92: I love Zaddy Nath!
[1:54:09] moonkinny: I liked the zones
[1:54:13] moonkinny: there was slot tondo
[1:54:26] cosmicblood84: shadow land is after life right or wrong
[1:54:30] moonkinny: they met in a bar in Minneapolis
[1:54:33] Deatheran: if the whole shadowlands was literaly game of thrones but between the different cov leaders ending with denathrius it would have been so good
[1:54:37] cosmicblood84: they call it after life
[1:54:41] Clodagh_Lunaria: Good evening <3
[1:54:43] thunduz: 100%
[1:54:47] Noznatation: Agree
[1:54:53] Nickystr1x: i had this cook of there being a library type building in the capitol cities where you could read about the background lore not found in game as well as other things you'd never know about the game unless you went on wowhead/etc
[1:55:14] HSAyril: How are they supposed to throw everyone for a plot twist no one knows about if they inform players of what's going on?
[1:55:22] cosmicblood84: correct me if im wrong shadowland is afterland
[1:55:22] thunduz: waring kingdoms is always fun
[1:55:27] moonkinny: jailor was bad
[1:55:29] doomer_dan_: I miss Bwonsamdi
[1:55:31] Sarkans41: Denathrius should have been the end xpac boss and the "jailer" should have been a construct resurrected by Denathrius
[1:55:32] cosmicblood84: marvel  wrote the jailer
[1:55:36] Noznatation: biggest problem with the jailer was prob. that no one wrote him yes :D
[1:55:43] moonkinny: jailor mind controlled danusa
[1:55:44] jimbowheat: Needed more Nathanos.
[1:55:44] thunduz: @doomer_dan_ facts, Bwonsamdi was under used
[1:55:59] jdodge1305: @taliesin running waycrest manor all season long reminds me of how there was supposedly going to be a mueh'zala (sp?) raid and/or gorak tul drust stuff in Ardenweald
[1:56:02] SkyForged13: My personal soapbox: I'm still mad they didnt revamp archeaology in Shadowlands to build out the Warcraft universe more
[1:56:03] thunduz: Marvel would have done the jailor perfectly
[1:56:04] HSAyril: Fuckin' yes. Bring back Bwonsamdi
[1:56:05] frankenfoot5: I wish Sylvanas was a raid boss in BFA after the Mak'gora who escaped afterwards and then we get the lead up to Shadowlands
[1:56:14] thunduz: tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight tneTaliWasRight
[1:56:14] valianya: Baine was criminally under used
[1:56:14] OGpersi_: Iridikron is marvel
[1:56:22] ivashkov92: @jimbowheat Agreed. How the heck do we kill him just to not see him in the Shadowlands 😆
[1:56:28] DrGreatScott: They would've tried to THanos him but he still would've sucked
[1:56:29] Tokryva: he wouldve seen Argus landing in the Shadowlands and smile
[1:56:29] RoboticUnicorn007: We would have heard something about him in Wrath
[1:56:31] moonkinny: bfa story was the problem
[1:56:32] neverbornlucky: Taliesin take your  woke deadpool saves marvel crap else where. We know Kang  is the Jailer from marvel
[1:56:35] Icepumpkin99: I think it was telling that the Jailor didnd have a final design at the expansion announcement.
[1:56:38] StingerPlaysGames: Now that sylvanas' soul is back whole will she have a different outlook? Where do you see her focus at now?
[1:56:39] jimbowheat: Thanos was incredibly well done, considering he's a big blue dude with a bollock chin
[1:56:40] frankenfoot5: And meanwhile everyone else was eating Shwarma
[1:56:43] Dred_Scythe: The jailer would have sent GUldan back, seeing just a portion of his hand....
[1:56:44] thunduz: like a little whisper in her ear sitting on the warchief throne
[1:56:45] moonkinny: agreed
[1:56:47] GameingAspect: but the sword?
[1:56:51] big_scoo: everyone would have loved that.
[1:56:52] ivashkov92: haha
[1:56:58] cosmicblood84: well let me resay that jailer is like shoe horning in tharnos in
[1:56:59] Noznatation: The teasing had been better - story had still been shit though :D
[1:57:00] Deatheran: fucking sargeras would have as he died told us to beware the chaned one "cut to jailer shadow profiles with eyes"
[1:57:05] cosmicblood84: hahahaha kang is jailer
[1:57:07] krisz49: hi
[1:57:08] moonkinny: and Tom hiddleston would have been in it
[1:57:10] cosmicblood84: 'facts
[1:57:16] cosmicblood84: your right
[1:57:17] thunduz: sadly yeah Kang is Marvel Jailor tneEvi
[1:57:30] frankenfoot5: I know it's always easier to pitch alternatives after the fact, but GOD DANG IT, Tali's pitch about the post-Legion thing would have been really cool to see in-game
[1:57:31] cosmicblood84: kang as going to jail
[1:57:33] doomer_dan_: @moonkinny tom hiddleston can be in everything, that beautiful man
[1:57:43] Deatheran: who the fuck is kang... dude at the end of loki?
[1:57:47] MrAndersen_: the marvel credit teasers only make sense if the character teased is a known character so wouldnt make sense for jailer
[1:57:50] KyleS07: @doomer_dan_ Agree
[1:57:50] jimbowheat: Which comic book villian would you play if MArvel asked?
[1:57:54] influx_404_: I don't think he PLANNED all of it he just set some key points and adapting along the way
[1:57:58] OGpersi_: i didnt say iridikron is bad, just marvel
[1:58:06] aurum2509: why are people comparing WoW to marvel they’re completely different things 💀
[1:58:07] cosmicblood84: @TaliesinAndEvitel  but i agree with marvel writing of jailer
[1:58:21] lynscribe: @Deatheran kang the conquerer, time traveling baddie
[1:58:24] Syzmical: Fyrakk mid, Iridikron slaps
[1:58:27] cosmicblood84: that great sir
[1:58:29] moonkinny: agreed in the baddies in dragonflight
[1:58:30] SkyForged13: It would have been cool if Sylvanas ended up knocking out the Artbiter and then ended up becoming the Jailor
[1:58:36] HazMatt_Prime: What, you don't like the line "Puny mortal?"
[1:58:42] neverbornlucky: Taliesin did you see the deadpool 3 trailer? Its great
[1:58:48] aeson_of_raid_sock: they call him the jailer because those nips are arresting
[1:58:51] moonkinny: at midnight jailor will return book it!
[1:59:08] Deatheran: foreshadowing is a usefull writing tool that is used to .......
[1:59:22] KyleS07: He'll betray Xal after defeating the Titans. Calling it.
[1:59:26] Syzmical: @aeson_of_raid_sock those nips make me uncomfortable, wish they were bowls of fruit ):
[1:59:40] DrGreatScott: Iridikron is peak villian in WoW. Best we've had in a while. BUT haven't really seen his actual menace outside the book. That being said, he's menacing while barely lifting a finger. We didn't even kill him in the dungeon, just weaken him only to have that retconned by Iridikron
[2:00:01] KyleS07: YES! That!
[2:00:14] HolocronCoder: F

[2:00:34] neverbornlucky: The joker
[2:00:36] Harai_Ulfsark: the infinites made themselves look pretty dumb back there tbh
[2:00:43] influx_404_: Thought it was me for a sec
[2:00:43] kaijoe_: yeah, the book really highlights that aspect of Iridikron
[2:00:53] aeson_of_raid_sock: danuser hacking your stream
[2:01:06] BigD530: Regular OBS or StreamLabs?
[2:01:10] valianya: He doesn't have to gloat over tools he used and discarded
[2:01:23] frankenfoot5: Tali, in your dream scenario, when should we fight IriddyDiddyKron as a raid boss?
[2:01:24] inspector_zed: same with his brother, right?
[2:01:25] cosmicblood84: yes
[2:01:30] cosmicblood84: they are

[2:01:42] nezzynerdz: blizzard took him out
[2:01:42] cosmicblood84: you back
[2:01:43] whisperlude: I think the way you explained the jailer, with him having an infinite amount of time for things to work they way they did makes a lot of sense
[2:01:45] SamuraiWillZ916: back
[2:01:46] nezzynerdz: was aboutta spoil whole plan
[2:02:15] cosmicblood84: yes
[2:02:16] influx_404_: Did Iridikron even care for Fyrakk?
[2:02:19] cosmicblood84: 100%
[2:02:36] SkyForged13: What do you think 'The Last Titan' will all entail Tali?
[2:02:41] KyleS07: I really hope she survives. I dont' stan many characters. But I stan Xal.
[2:02:43] HazMatt_Prime: I think Iridikron should have tiny arms in visage form
[2:02:49] moonkinny: I agree
[2:02:52] cosmicblood84: its been set est legion
[2:02:54] DrGreatScott: Just more cosmic power to abuse to get the Titans's attention
[2:03:12] Trebled_Mind: In Midnight do you think Silvermoon will become a multi faction city like Belameth?
[2:03:17] moonkinny: I loved the second half of dragonflight.   and the kaluak
[2:03:27] frankenfoot5: He is going to survive to the end of midnight you think?
[2:03:34] SkyForged13: Return of Illi-daddy?!
[2:03:37] KeyouiX: @Trebled_Mind please no, we're just getting good rp back there
[2:03:43] DragnosiOfNede: Iridikron will kill them... and then the First Ones will show up to Put him down ;)
[2:03:45] DrGreatScott: Can we put Xaly in another kniafu? UwU
[2:03:46] jimbowheat: Are we going to fight a Light-maddened Turalyon or a Void-infused Alyeria?
[2:03:47] GameingAspect: a dragon as big as world soul
[2:03:57] Xannah08: So Azeroth can havea world soul but not be a titan?
[2:04:03] JackOnline: all i need is sylvannas and a space heater and im a happy man
[2:04:08] cosmicblood84: what wrong cosmic power being abused hi pally
[2:04:11] martianxl: Do you think this Saga will be the end of WoW?  Not sure where the story goes after the sage...
[2:04:14] doomer_dan_: Would you say it's gonna be an Attack on Titan?? :D
[2:04:14] seanstrachan: Oh not not a Dany forgot about the iron fleet or whatever
[2:04:19] HazMatt_Prime: But Eonar is hot. I don't want this.
[2:04:19] zeckzeckzeck: so many people missed what actually happens in Dawn
[2:04:20] Noznatation: He likes to pretend to support people until he no longer has an use for them, and he likes and audience when he does (we know he let them spy on them) - kinda reminds you of some rich fucks in the world today .D
[2:04:33] cosmicblood84: yes
[2:04:37] HazMatt_Prime: Also....Iridikron vs Sargeras....the world stabber
[2:04:39] frankenfoot5: Damn, now that's a neat theory
[2:04:45] bomayaa: azeroth
[2:04:45] OGpersi_: the only thing i dont like about that is that the titans are effectively dead already, completely  irrelevant in the story. why would you care about that "twist"
[2:04:51] TyndiVelspaz: I've had that same feeling since they announced it
[2:04:57] cosmicblood84: illidan is going be wiorking with him
[2:04:58] Lacee666: metzen said in last titan we will witness the return of them
[2:05:13] cosmicblood84: you watch
[2:05:15] HSAyril: Illidan becomes a titan, and is the last titan
[2:05:21] frankenfoot5: Very Dickensian start of Last Titan for you, Tali. "The Titans were dead."
[2:05:27] JMan31337: Dragonflight story was not bad I think the major disappointment for me was the crafting and dragon riding not working on other dragon mounts
[2:05:27] moonkinny: yes
[2:05:33] Xannah08: dead again? didn't Sargeras already kill the other titans?
[2:05:33] Shanhayde: @Lacee666 it would be fire if the expansion cinematic would be the titans dying to Irridikron
[2:05:35] Sharktribe: Sharktribe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! I'm a storyboard artist and thinking of doing a WoW blizzard cinematic for a Yrel-light invasion post 13.0 for a personal project. I should run it by this community for feedback
[2:05:39] jimbowheat: In what expansion does the Illidan/Sargeras buddy cop story play out?
[2:05:42] maplelost: where are the first ones
[2:05:43] Harai_Ulfsark: killed on the first quest in the expansion i hope
[2:05:49] cosmicblood84: titans are going to fall
[2:06:09] DrGreatScott: @Noznatation I'd also note that Iridikron is devastatingly powerful, but doesn't show all of his power. I think he comes off as an unassuming baddie for other baddies. Probably see him as a means to an end until he Uno reverses them
[2:06:18] Trebled_Mind: I think Chris Metzen is the true last titan 😂
[2:06:18] CeasiusPls: my prediction is they won't commit to fully killing them, but we'll see
[2:06:42] cosmicblood84: do it
[2:06:46] cosmicblood84: hell yes
[2:06:51] stizzelino: i guess sageras tried to kill azeroth, at least he gives his live for her to protect her
[2:06:52] Bjerreh: Bjerreh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[2:06:55] KeyouiX: LIGHT PORTAL
[2:07:01] Harai_Ulfsark: the good portal
[2:07:02] bomayaa: Yrel rules
[2:07:04] Kortinas: Light portal
[2:07:22] Sharktribe: I'm thinking Yrel shows up in her huge ship to shut down what's happened after Worldsoul saga, we end up having to protect captured Xalatath against her zeal or something like that
[2:07:25] HazMatt_Prime: This story will make Magni cry
[2:07:30] cosmicblood84: lights hope is were would storm out of
[2:07:35] moonkinny: world soul saga is all about food and music
[2:07:37] cosmicblood84: if ask me
[2:07:40] Sarkans41: Void gonna be our friends
[2:07:44] ivashkov92: Yea, expansion after Last Titan will be a brand new start for WoW and its lore
[2:07:49] Harai_Ulfsark: oh no you said reboot here comes the wow 2.0 people
[2:07:49] bomayaa: But what would be left from a overarching meta marrative?
[2:07:50] SkyForged13: Do you think the Aspects could be elevated by Azeroth (upon her birth) into new Titans, if the old Titans are killed off?
[2:07:51] knightjudicator: @Sharktribe god i really hope Yrel can be reasoned with.. she didnt even get a finished story before they used her to Make Light Bad
[2:07:56] KyleS07: Any theories on what might come next?
[2:07:58] Sharktribe: "Crown of Light" , referencing that Il'gynoth whisper
[2:07:59] maplelost: 20 years? what about the shadowlands saga
[2:08:14] DrGreatScott: Is Yrel going to be a fanatical exarch?
[2:08:18] SkyForged13: since the Aspects have Titan-like designations
