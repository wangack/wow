[0:20:10] jordan777333: do you think the finals is gonna last ore die out in a couple months
[0:20:11] CaptainOdens: Could The finals have pro teams? Would it be balanced enough you think?
[0:20:13] paliaco: This game has upscaling locked with no ability to turn it off, its built poorly and then they put DLSS on top as a crutch. Runs like shit on my pc, even 2042 runs better

[0:22:05] default_guy77: @cdn_jacob no, it's not
[0:22:06] paliaco: @paperjamxnz and lawbreakers was 10x harder and with a bigger skill ceiling
[0:22:16] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D

[0:22:39] default_guy77: @cdn_jacob where the lean button in the finals?
[0:22:41] paliaco: @paperjamxnz lawbreakers had better netcode a decade ago
[0:22:42] YashaTheFox: @tok_jbm I verified files, and it still happens.
[0:22:43] yourboyvoldemort: is this game gonna be better than jak and dexter?

[0:22:55] cdn_jacob: @default_guy77 what are you going on about
[0:22:58] touristog: most ppl complaining because they are playing ranked and it hasnt populated yet. so if you party que. it takes time for brackets to fill up
[0:23:01] neoq80: are hackers killing the game ?
[0:23:05] gamergirlbathwatermaster: @yourboyvoldemort debatable but its close
[0:23:10] SirJersey: triple M? holy
[0:23:11] 53MPER: How do you think this game can avoid the same fate as splitgate or similar games? @shroud
[0:23:14] ahalle95: sup!

[0:23:35] paperjamxnz: @paliaco I wasn’t confused about the net code part LUL
[0:23:36] default_guy77: @cdn_jacob u said this game is a fusion of r6 and apex, my question is where the fuck is the lean button?
[0:23:36] PinnWut: @YashaTheFox find where your eac is installed and delete it and try to run it after
[0:23:44] banifiz: Well also doing RPG style progression in a round based shooter is just weird. Like whats the end game there or the state of the game at like 2 weeks? Needs some kind of round economy instead
[0:23:47] cdn_jacob: @default_guy77 apex doesnt have lean
[0:23:49] juhi_: they need to do something about the c4 bombs
[0:23:50] yourboyvoldemort: shroud needs to run sniper he would own
[0:23:57] justicebringa: R6 on steroids lmao

[0:27:46] SuggaV: @cdn_jacob what rank are we at?
[0:27:49] machriphi: @neoq80 Shroud's been using it since the beta because: 1) he feels it's better at poking long range and he likes taking those engagements. 2) He thinks the AKM looks ugly. 3) He thinks it's harder to use, and so when he wins gunfights with it, his opponent knows he's better.
[0:27:50] andrejkee20101: PepegaAim so?

[0:32:53] Dotward54: Do the tanks explode on impact on both the ground or wall? Is there a minimum distance?

[0:33:37] UpShot33: @lighthandler aah i see
[0:33:37] ilari___: @airehon750 Ye they are pretty bad
[0:33:39] machriphi: @Dotward54 There is a minimum distance, and it depends if you throw them, or melee them. Throw goes straight but bounces, melee knocks the cap off and it doesn't always go straight but blows up sooner.
[0:33:40] phastfire: @dotward54 they have to be going fast enough or pass a time limit, or if you sshoot the nozzle they blow

[0:36:35] machriphi: @dorkeyporkey Light class has a sniper, but it's honestly not great. You can absolutely pub stomp with it, but in ranked it's about defending indoor points and using shields and so snipers can't really get angles.
[0:36:39] dorkeyporkey: this is just battle field hardline
[0:36:39] papootchk: @enlyus yea this game alot of fun, you cant play apex as a solo player anymore tbf

[0:53:12] DuxBrale: @Pimpariffic Same thoughts
[0:53:12] reffor: @ohnoblastingoff its situational
[0:53:20] jaawkneee: defib only restores a small amount of health compared to a full hold heal

[0:53:36] Pimpariffic: he has heals for a reason..
[0:53:42] Montblack007: dropping was not the play
[0:53:42] TechBonus: also defib has a cooldown so you want it if you arent in a fight
[0:53:49] tresdots: @Dubstepdoggo545 the big problem with fcar is the mag. fcar is great against heavy. but you need more mag if you go against teams with bunch of lights and medium imo
[0:53:50] DuxBrale: It's faster and has a heal
[0:54:05] 5timewcwchampbookert: bros playing MGS
[0:54:06] CookingWithKama: oh nay they r loosing

[1:30:17] R0ndras: @hazmiae apex has nothing to do with this.  If Finals focused on more COD/BF like modes, that would be up to debate, but it didnt either. It just its own stuff.

[1:30:51] AcuboIsDoomed: @ajah66 I agree with Tyr4, twitch doesn't represent if a game succeeded or not, itr depends on the devs and the playerbase
[1:30:52] Decryptes: the shrovement
[1:30:55] FioraSlayer: @Qixni new maps is no surprise but they'll probably add in new weapons/gadgets, map events, and maybe a new gamemode
[1:30:59] jeckyolog: shroud gon try arena? or nah??
[1:31:02] blowupmymind12: holy, this is beautiful to watch

[1:33:35] FunkyFlump: I'm fine with the shields if throwables go through them.
[1:33:39] AcuboIsDoomed: @jackissosick they die fast, but also are the hardest class if u wanna catch them, they can go invisible or dash etc
[1:33:48] Raggamuff: Is it ok as a dad gamer that I am just playing MW3 for the shooter feel and grinding camos/

[1:36:40] desolace_: @Tyr4 cause it gives an unfair advantage..?
[1:36:41] 420smoke: @ajah66 @ajah66 it does but compared to other games you can learn recoil patterns quite easily, its fairly tame I'd say
[1:36:41] Rowboh: @ohnoblastingoff ye i only have a 1080 144hz monitro

[1:38:50] OutrunPilot: The amount of heavy cpu usage on this game is hilarious. Who would know that next gen games would revert to the 90s era, just consume the whole cpu forget gpu
[1:38:52] ohnoblastingoff: @iDini for just gaming 7950x34 is a waste of money at 600$ price tag while performing within margin of error to 7800x3d
[1:38:54] zachtics: @gorbataiagora1 go wtf
[1:38:55] guardianguy: Having a large monitor with more display is more "cheaty" than a freaking crosshair overlay. None of it matters. Still comes down to skill.
[1:38:59] beave69: @SkyzzangQQ  I ion got the money, I got a i3 12100f and a gtx 1080 ti, works for most games but this game is so cpu dependet
[1:39:09] Sarnt_Roos: once you stop playing tarkov and go play games that are fast and responsive Tarkov feels like a$$
[1:39:13] Kitsuroo: @gorbataiagora1 fuck tarkov arena LUL
[1:39:19] dutchlaws: does anybody know how to optimize an 7950x3d for this game?
[1:39:25] default_guy77: @guardianguy and too wide for me DansGame
[1:39:27] kirkoswald30: tarkov arena looks pretty average
[1:39:31] poolaryy: is that drlupo

[1:39:41] televators_: is this sponsored or is this game actually good?
[1:39:44] percival_the_merciful: This game is absolute trash
[1:39:50] iDini: @ohnoblastingoff you can easily get it for $500 almost always with sales on every site, it's worth the money, look at any gaming benchmark
[1:39:50] default_guy77: @televators_ no sponsor
[1:39:57] 420smoke: @percival_the_merciful no it isnt

[1:40:32] kirkoswald30: oo tribes 3 beta is out
[1:40:33] ohnoblastingoff: @iDini I am apart of benchmark communities. I know what i'm talking about. 7950x3d performs within a couple fps as 7800x3d because it has core scheduling issues.
[1:40:37] R0ndras: @desolace_ yeah but what does that have to do with gta vi xd
[1:40:39] default_guy77: Classic one hatewatcher lirikEat
[1:40:41] Xenserino: but yeah pretty much i got a ultrawide and ordered a ryzen 9 7950xd for my working pc, but i rly wanna make a stable gaming pc that works for 2-3 years maxed out, any ideas on gpu cpu combo?

[1:43:01] AcuboIsDoomed: @Xenserino if u wanna play 1440p 160hz (fps) on most games from 3 years from now, its kinda hard, even a 4090 would hardly do that, maybe wait for the next gpu/cpu generation and buy the top tier of both
[1:43:03] suddss21: Im playing against him right now in the final match. We are 3 solos lmaooo

[1:44:39] R0ndras: @dutchlaws The 7800 is better for gaming. But the 7950 will beat it on some games, and thats by a minimal margin of like 5-10 fps(MAX).  Its just not worth it
[1:44:45] xbeefdead: i had a cheater last round

[1:46:40] ohnoblastingoff: I just said under the right tuning with a program called "Project Lasso" the 7950x3d does beat the 7800x3d across a couple titles. When you fix the core scheduling issues, it's a beast in gaming.
[1:46:48] R0ndras: @dutchlaws i mean if you have it already and at that price, its great.  Its just not good if you're buying new at the recomended prices. For me its like a 300€ difference right now
[1:46:55] iambarbAric: gotta love twitch i had 8 mins to watch and got 5 mins in ads

[3:43:50] friedpastry7: Its common knowledge Shroud has a fat cock
[3:43:53] easty1311: why you play sledge hammer without reinhard shield?
[3:44:02] Xiuba: @ESCNR15 haven't been able to since CBT1

[3:44:16] ESCNR15: @Xiuba was it patched?
[3:44:20] lighthandler: @TrojanJonez Yea, it's a mix. Reinhard + Winston
[3:44:23] ESCNR15: haven't done it  in a real game
[3:44:25] Xiuba: @hideonpupusas they need to nerf the shotgun the hammer is fine
[3:44:26] KontrolStyle: EZ
[3:44:31] LetsGoLeo_: OMEGALUL
[3:44:35] skyzzqq: they should give you a throwable hammer, have 2 as default
[3:44:37] Fariimonstah: I fucking hate heavy KEKW
[3:44:38] LetsGoLeo_: oh my god
[3:44:43] Xiuba: @ESCNR15 ever since CBT2 yes
[3:44:45] mechrome: shroud is the best dude
[3:44:46] Visvge: heavy shotgun has like a full second faster ttk than the next best weapon its crazy overpowered
[3:44:47] releker: releker subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 3 months, lets get it

[3:45:37] grimnirg: @Visvge shotguns is always a headache to balance im surprised that devs still putting it into their games
[3:45:37] KonTikiTP: i dont think this is the meta lol
[3:45:38] FizzFisch: bruh what
[3:45:38] ethicks: no it should stay bad
[3:45:40] HeimgangTR: god of war throw needed

[3:45:41] kemosabe1205: Jugular*
[3:45:42] cptjacksparowt: hey
[3:45:42] manotehmuffin: it needs a lunge like the sword
[3:45:45] MikeFaulksy: LOL nahhh
[3:45:46] feelsshadowman: no thanks
[3:45:48] ethicks: if melee is good it becomes very unfun
[3:45:48] Qwayzi: sledgehammer is balanced
[3:45:48] o0nga_bunga: C
[3:45:49] Jark55: or buff your skill
[3:45:49] maravisz: He wants it buffed? hell nah
[3:45:49] skyzzqq: nahh
[3:45:50] spadecr: not sniper
[3:45:50] d_wayne24: no
[3:45:51] superskunq: sniper is nuts
[3:45:52] InYourFaceVAL: KEKW
[3:45:52] ojotta: cade os br ?

[3:45:55] xiquo: just make everything OP
[3:45:55] MikeFaulksy: it literally does 75 damage
[3:45:55] def_not_jeff: nerf the gas
[3:45:56] LingWinny: skill issue
[3:45:57] WatchfulTomato: 50% dmg reduction with hammer equiped lol
[3:45:58] swanieclapz: !monitor
[3:45:58] forsen_e_nation: is this game getting bigger?
[3:45:58] Fossabot: @swanieclapz He's currently testing the 240 Hz ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM https://info.shroud.fyi/ROGMonitor
[3:45:58] arthurold2: Buff bomb launcher too
[3:45:58] isi3456789: sledgehammer hits like a dumptruck
[3:45:59] skyzzqq: 3 ppl just cant run the same wep
[3:45:59] boorae159: yeah buff sniper pls
[3:45:59] FizzFisch: sledge is balanced for the health that you have
[3:46:00] kemosabe1205: Aite
[3:46:00] LetsGoLeo_: sniper buff yes
[3:46:00] ruhusx: And nerf that stupid shotgun
[3:46:01] IsavvageI: what is best gun anyways
[3:46:01] ajah66: not the sniper pls
[3:46:02] CookingWithKama: sniper needs to be 1 shot chest
[3:46:03] mechrome: gas def needs nerf
[3:46:04] jalinrhabeu: LOL nahhh
[3:46:06] Xiuba: @DatBoiDisco Double Barrel on Light also two taps Heavy. Medium has the only "balanced" shotgun and it has a reload bug.
[3:46:07] tlgreg: Buff the StinkyCheese ? Umm
[3:46:08] superskunq: sniper maybe should 1 shot medium too
[3:46:08] K_Y_U_B_I: Heavy could  use an anti-material rifle
[3:46:08] 1crazyblackbeard: @MikeFaulksy for real, Im say that too
[3:46:11] Maaack3: no u can destroy buildings with it, instead nerf the broken weapons rather than just buffing everything so everything turns to CoD's TTK
[3:46:12] Godger_: sniper should be 1 hit on headshots regardless of hp
[3:46:14] airstrike1028: Yeah because I need the heavy being pocketed by 2 medics to have a buffed sledge hammer
[3:46:17] Visvge: @Visvge i think it would be okay if the ttk was only like .5 seconds faster at its perfect range, the issue is heavies all play double shield so they can force you to be close
[3:46:17] MikeFaulksy: @1crazyblackbeard fucking crazy to say that
[3:46:21] EcchiAddiction: i feel like the sniper has it's niche usecases and would be stupid strong if it got a buff
[3:46:22] ArttAtack: You old nerf/buffs
[3:46:24] obiwandahomie: i see a sniper in my group and i know it’s an L
[3:46:24] KonTikiTP: i think the sledgehammer is more intended for destroying walls and shit than fighting lmfao
[3:46:30] ArttAtack: Good*
[3:46:45] mr_pinguiino_: just arrived so whats the answer to the title
[3:46:53] o0nga_bunga: C4 on rpg
[3:46:54] EliteSoldier109: Im sure you know this but you can melee the gas canisters so they explode quicker :3
[3:46:54] HanzDiesel: Not with that attitude Madge
[3:46:56] uSakana: theyre not doing anything about it iitzDead
[3:46:57] craicfiend: sledgehammer has a short lunge effect, test it on practice range you, also dont need to be right on the target to connect
[3:46:58] Visvge: @KonTikiTP which is why it should be equipment not weapon slot imo
[3:46:59] wodotheun: lol new hammer time
[3:46:59] CleftBrain: thrown
[3:47:00] skyzzqq: the right click should be a gap closer skill
[3:47:06] Hug_my_cat: maybe if purple steals
[3:47:09] boorae159: team wipe is expensive
[3:47:09] alpha____q____up: autooooo shotttyyy
[3:47:13] SnowIsAFK: 2 hammers & 1 shotgun meta?
[3:47:16] Visvge: the only viable melee in the game is the dagger
[3:47:18] 1crazyblackbeard: @MikeFaulksy dope name btw FAULKSYYY
[3:47:19] TheUnrealOculus: @shroud
[3:47:19] S7ADE: no fix for missing contestants>?

[3:47:28] arthurold2: @shroud Play triple grenade launcher
[3:47:31] TheUnrealOculus: when are you playing tarkov arena?
[3:47:32] 1crazyblackbeard: @1crazyblackbeard like foxy?
[3:47:35] Visvge: @ozone379 it's not bad it's hard
[3:47:38] ajah66: @Visvge katana is great
[3:47:41] Shirozura_: YEP
[3:47:42] Godger_: right click should be a jump forward aoe attack on sledge
[3:47:44] DofoCS: run into them @shroud SwiftRage
[3:47:47] DofoCS: it deals 180 dmg per tick OMEGALUL
[3:47:48] LandoDolo: What if they let you run while swinging? @shroud
[3:47:50] shin_hong: YEP YEP
[3:47:53] Visvge: @Visvge katana is fine in quick match but against 3stacks not rly
[3:47:58] Xiuba: @ozone379 you need to be very good to do things with it otherwise you're deadweight. It's easier to be useful as Medium/Heavy.
[3:47:59] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[3:48:02] DofoCS: 120* im trippin

[3:48:18] spadecr: it’s good when it hits
[3:48:18] slavander_: @DofoCS 140*

[3:48:19] hole_flation: intentionally playing on hard mode lol
[3:48:22] i_feel_you_son: they should buff all the game LUL LUL
[3:48:22] omeggie: yer 20?!~?
[3:48:24] HeimgangTR: i think all the other things are too strong sledge and rush is fine
[3:48:25] superskunq: remove charge and make rpg a specialty
[3:48:28] Markivory: @shroud if you jump while charging you'll slam the ground
[3:48:29] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[3:48:29] MyDudeDuck: fuck that dont buff anything for heavies. heavies are busted as is already
[3:48:31] DofoCS: @slavander_ heavy player spotted mods WutFace
[3:48:32] Maaack3: bruh shourd the charge deals fricking 130 dmg, it leaves medium at 20 health and it can bump multiple times. "buff this buff that" bro pls
[3:48:34] Godger_: jump while charging ok
[3:48:40] 1crazyblackbeard: buff the weapons....AND their health lol

[3:49:34] slavander_: 3 revolvers maybe?
[3:49:36] Xenomm: goo gun
[3:49:36] notxico: @superskunq ew
[3:49:36] organicktubejuice: rip I bought the model 1887 instead of the scar because I was expecting it to be a hard hitting marksman gun but the default revolver does that job better than the unlock gun
[3:49:37] ozone379: @ozone379 ok thank you
