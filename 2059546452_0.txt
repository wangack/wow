[0:29:04] gapeh0rn: this is a classic
[0:29:27] mebanehots: what do you think bis pvp talents are now? dots are good but every other class is just doing giga single target so the rot doesnt have time to do its job
[0:29:28] ITzGunni: You excited for cata? or
[0:29:39] Solushun: izolo the hero we need
[0:29:41] rainmannxz: cata KEKW
[0:29:45] avenomxx: Excited for MoP but not Cata
[0:30:10] austinfilms_: yo yo yo
[0:30:17] Madalynn: How far do you think they are going to go with releasing the classic expansions again ?
[0:30:53] Dropnloadz: at this point they mayt as well goto mop
[0:31:00] austinfilms_: love it
[0:31:00] Dropnloadz: wod onwards was garbanzo

[0:31:37] deltrexx: mop+ sod lol
[0:31:41] rainmannxz: Remember early MoP? was thinking mostly pvp xd
[0:31:46] illusive9073: if they were smart they would've rode the multiverse hype and changed up cata from being dogshit. like are they really gonna release wod in its launch state?
[0:31:54] duckiezgo: @snutzy don’t forget to eat Snutz the brain needs food on these long streams
[0:31:54] gratzitko: @snutzy sorry to burst ur bubble, but ur gonna be really sad with 40 warlock pvp
[0:32:17] secretlyfvmous: dont blame gdkps. blame game design and mgmt
[0:32:23] gratzitko: i can barely get a corruption up, b4 getting 1 shot, by almost everything lol
[0:32:27] austinfilms_: im leveling a priest with the sole intention of healing you in wpvp
[0:32:38] harvey_95: There is 0 pvp someone dies in 100-0 in 4 seconds
[0:32:45] gratzitko: yealol
[0:32:51] austinfilms_: ill def raid heal
[0:33:06] Madalynn: Is there not that much hype in the classic community for classic cata then ?
[0:33:18] austinfilms_: i dont feel the addiction this phase like i did in phase 1. im down to play this casual
[0:33:27] Solushun: rdruid doesnt get good until MoP?
[0:33:37] rainmannxz: mop pvp Kreygasm
[0:33:43] ITzGunni: I feel the same austin tbh lol
[0:33:47] austinfilms_: i also felt like phase 1 stayed active the whole time
[0:33:58] the_moist_factory: druids starsurge and priest shadow word death is insane rn at 40
[0:34:10] the_moist_factory: there are people getting 1800 starsurges
[0:34:15] gratzitko: @the_moist_factory its not just them, rogues and ferals 1 shotting too.
[0:34:18] avenomxx: they will balance it for sure, give it a few weeks
[0:34:19] varatupaj: and priests
[0:34:20] austinfilms_: good for them

[0:35:10] gratzitko: na apparently theres a sick destro meta warlock spec where u go ruin and searing pain, and it claps rly hard right now, APPARENTLY, havent tried yet, sounds boring tho
[0:35:10] Solushun: i wokeup at 9pm lmao
[0:35:11] moistspeedo: not doing the tourney?
[0:35:16] paxz07: have u tried questing in stv

[0:35:30] cojonesdefuego: no sm?
[0:35:40] paxz07: lvl 40 taurens rolling up to me turning into boomkin 1 shot me
[0:36:18] paxz07: has to be nerfed or game will suck
[0:36:21] gratzitko: they seem to be critting like 90% of there starsurges idk why lol
[0:36:28] the_moist_factory: cuz of talents
[0:36:29] paxz07: i got crit for 900 by a lvl 31
[0:36:31] paxz07: when i was 34
[0:36:41] Zeroflex1: tank lock is INSANE, pulling 300dps sustained with just searing pain
[0:36:45] gratzitko: well there isnt an insane amount of stamina on any of the gear, u barely get more hp thenm p1
[0:36:55] gratzitko: even in the ful bis gear ur hp is still way 2 low so yea
[0:36:57] csant1023: a starsurge crit me for 1200.... I have 1800 health. lol
[0:37:05] gratzitko: yea haha
[0:37:42] Zellane_TV: starsurge is literally a instant cast spirit bomb
[0:37:42] gratzitko: im not worried tho, because everyone seems to be on the same page about the damage being out of control, and blizz has seemed to listen to the majority of the population on changes
[0:37:44] Garrott2: been so many years since i played I sometimes dont know what you guys are talking about lol
[0:37:46] Zellane_TV: its so broken
[0:38:23] csant1023: I just dont get how hard can it be to get the numbers down.... no skill should be hitting that hard with this health pool.
[0:38:27] the_moist_factory: is going 1/1 4/4 exhuastion worth?
[0:38:27] gratzitko: i jus grabbed the demonic knowledge rune, gives about 40 spell power in the current gear im in, which seems decent i guess
[0:38:31] Zellane_TV: 0 mana, no cd, instant cast, 40yd range for 1.2k crits. just spam and win
[0:38:40] Zeroflex1: yeah man, I just one shot a lvl 40 mage
[0:38:42] Zeroflex1: feelsgood

[2:27:54] yoitshesi: oh dope
[2:28:26] yoitshesi: any runes you really like that are implemented so far?
[2:29:03] yoitshesi: rogue has been really fun, shadowstep on gcd feels strange. but not sure its horrible
[2:29:11] yoitshesi: mutilate is busted
[2:29:21] Cromaidus: We have any idea what the raid is for p3 yet?
[2:29:44] zugmadonk: Sunken temple for sure
[2:29:46] zugmadonk: if i had to guess
[2:29:48] reggieledeux: i just dont like the meta and where it seems to be going, instant cast range spells that do 70 percent of your health
[2:30:08] BigbadKevin: thought they said u couldnt do higher dungeons past ZF
[2:30:13] arcane_p: @yoitshesi shadow step does feel strange I kept wondering why I couldn't shadow step kidney
[2:30:27] arcane_p: instantly
[2:30:44] magicvanilla1: Maurdon phase 3 def
[2:30:50] yoitshesi: @arcane_p yeah its a little weird. but I get it honestly I think it would be a little op if you could
[2:31:29] yoitshesi: I think the hard part about sod is that they are adding things that make the game more fast paced. and the core mechanics of the game arent meant for that
[2:32:01] yoitshesi: like how can you heal through instant cast that does a lot of damage with slow heals that arent meant to heal thru that burst

[2:33:35] arcane_p: your right
[2:33:40] yoitshesi: I did expect more 40's in your guild already lol feels like a lot of people aint been on that ive seen
[2:34:26] yoitshesi: think the average peoson gonna take like week and a half to 2 weeks
[2:35:11] simplyshredded22: the average will probably be closer to a month bro
[2:35:19] simplyshredded22: you'd be surprised how little the average person can play
[2:35:31] yoitshesi: @simplyshredded22 well I guess thats more true
[2:35:47] yoitshesi: the average casual probably plays what maybe an hour or two a day if that?
[2:35:48] seancyx: shimmering flats at night is the VIBE
[2:35:49] simplyshredded22: but I know what you mean, average "gamer"
[2:36:00] simplyshredded22: yeh if that bro
[2:36:39] killzxqt: what spec are you excited to pvp with at 40 @snutzy

[2:41:22] gravytrain_sd: i am having trouble deciding which character to main. rogue or warrior
[2:41:47] yoitshesi: War seems underwhelming from what ive seen from people ive been in dungeons with
[2:42:02] palereaper69: did they increase the xp rate by quests like they said they were doing in P2?
