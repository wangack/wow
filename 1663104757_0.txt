[1:12:02] RAF_Sean: No VDH love?
[1:12:04] nocturnal_2195: @citrineson but there's nothing wrong with rogue I'm actually  going to main rogue in df
[1:12:26] Wikedlyrics: @CartridgeBros VDH is nearly as strong as prot war and almost as immortal as them
[1:12:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Overall tank balance is pretty good
[1:12:26] MrsPyra: @Skylin3r you tighten all the lug nuts?
[1:12:48] StaticSoul: lazy way... right sounds like the route blizz will take.
[1:12:51] Nevindaz: did you saw the preach vod?
[1:13:02] Skylin3r: with my foot
[1:13:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brewmaster could use more defense and paladin could use more holy power generation, but overall the tanks are pretty close
[1:13:27] MrsPyra: @Skylin3r lets hope or someones getting a tire under the tree for xmas LUL
[1:13:28] Nevindaz: rlly cool changes that will happen from dragonf and next years
[1:13:33] Wikedlyrics: brewmaster just needs higher magic stagger, they're fine in raid but too much magic damage in M+
[1:13:34] Autoexeq: I hope they keep the warriors strong defensively. I think it speaks to the thought of a warrior with a big ass shield being tanky

[3:20:34] Voidred: @louthebarber___ they are revamping normal reputation into renown system so you get more rewards faster
[3:20:49] zeeAbe: @louthebarber___ They reworked the main reputations and they are called "renown", has nothing to do with the stuff that shadowlands had, just same name

[3:20:59] Specsifier: all ya'll who only played Legion forward are gonna be playing the real style of game WoW is. no more of these senseless infinite grinds anymore

[3:28:52] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee why the lack of a mindless grind makes it casual? you still have m+ mythic raiding and pvp i don't see it as casual
[3:29:12] s_t_o_r_m__: ah thanks Khlaro
[3:29:28] homewrecker101: is the renown gonna be time locked like SL?

[3:30:07] Demanisraar: That's good
[3:30:10] smoochsmoochy: is m0 available from first week?
[3:30:11] odriscoll1234: but they will ja e to for professions ?
[3:30:12] s_t_o_r_m__: more account unlocks!
[3:30:26] capitan_3steban: Awesome!
[3:30:30] tocu: @Towelliee if you havent watched the preach video they  were attempting to make it so the solo or more casual player had something to do when they want and ways to gain power but not as geared for your Gladiators, M+ pushers or mythic raiders since you have a higher power ceiling
[3:30:31] Demanisraar: that's such an improvement
[3:30:40] ClassicMalcontent: DF is only 'casual' to the most recent retail xpacs. Actual casual is WotLK classic.
[3:30:41] SpeciousArgument: what about profession unlocks?
[3:30:43] Velanthos: profession patterns still have to be ranked up from what I hear
[3:30:44] bonegazi: do the extra quest lines unlock for them too?
[3:30:47] MajurDJ: do humans still get incrased rep gains? do these on a human ez
[3:31:00] Sophizt: Crafters need the rep on each toon still
[3:31:01] AvrithSATX: Honestly, from what I saw in Beta, most of the stuff will unlock without you ever doing anything you wouldn't normally do anyway. It'll just be a little slower than a sweaty person pushing to unlock it all.

[3:31:34] TheNoidd: and probably bad for in game economics
[3:31:37] Kisswani: @Towelliee is it worth working on professions as we level , or just leave it to max level ?
[3:31:39] manmower: i wonder if they'll add more renown tracks
[3:31:51] Specsifier: that amount of power was percieved by nearly every player as a requirement. Don't try to downplay how bad those systems were @NickLeonhearth
[3:31:52] chrisflorens: @Towelliee the word drops gives you a timeout?
[3:32:06] ClassicMalcontent: If/when reputations are account-wide that will be the real casual expansion or WoW direction.
[3:32:14] Kisswani: we always had that with rep
[3:32:18] emznev: Chris I'm pretty sure it's to stop spam in the chat
[3:32:28] cptrogers123: im a CE raider and i will for sure do this in my spare time

[3:40:49] Teknofear64: dont need an addon
[3:40:49] TheNoidd: you can set that up in basic ui/keybinds the only difference is that it reduces the setup
[3:40:52] DeveKr: yeah, thank Soul for that. :)
[3:40:53] Willifer: @Collected1 no its 2 buttons for 2 actions
[3:40:53] mizerboy: what addon is it?
[3:40:54] AvrithSATX: It's not b/c you still have to initiate the action via the click.
[3:40:57] fewyn: yeah that's the same thing
[3:40:57] ChedaPlays: @Towelliee just disable the addon and bind interact key

[3:41:29] kimmo_gaming: thats different
[3:41:34] RivsHD: the addon changes the view scope of where interact key works while ur fishing - after ur done fishing it resets it back to default
[3:41:37] Teknofear64: its preset to the key left of "1"
[3:41:37] ChedaPlays: just addon makes a new interact button
[3:41:38] Oylex: its the same key that if you have a vendor next to where you are fishing, it's gonna talk to it instead of opening the lure

[3:54:52] dracullus: they left that option for super whales
[3:54:53] CardinalTX: leveling is fast fast fast
[3:54:57] jimsagas: isnt it 20$?
[3:55:00] abracka_: they should honestly drop the price of that boost, $60 is steep asf
[3:55:03] kodder12: @Skycoh  You`re the biggest frea
[3:55:03] Collected1: i always take herb and mining on levelling characters for that phat xp. I was getting 1200xp per node in the upper 50s
[3:55:10] smokeyk1pperttv: how do you max level in 3-4 hours haha
[3:55:14] Stoops21: wait how are you doing 3-4 hours?? from 1?
[3:55:20] Tiko119: $60 was only MAYBE worth it when the level cap was 120.
[3:55:24] kodder12: @Skycoh  freak
[3:55:26] jimsagas: well 3 hours if you got all heirlooms right or is that not right?
[3:55:35] the_general01: @stoops21 they reduced the time it takes to level
[3:55:39] akacvrtops: i think the 60 bucks is also to prevent people from buying a boost and actually playing character
[3:55:51] geokouts: by far the Fire invasions are the WORST for me
[3:55:51] temp3st98: when lvl boost was introduced the time to get from 1 to 90 was takin a week to lvl
[3:55:54] the_general01: @first_pepega heirlooms dont increase xp anymore. they dont do anything
[3:55:55] Kisswani: @first_pepega heirlooms dont give extra XP anymore
[3:55:59] MILESkg21: quicker to just level than buying the fuckin boost
[3:56:20] Alexkayzz: damn remeber before bfa when u had to do each expansion to get to 110
[3:56:22] temp3st98: or less
[3:56:23] Nasilvera: 120 was so long ago
[3:56:27] Finansdepartementet: The boost has been with us for a long time when u think about it
[3:56:28] Velanthos: they only leave it there to make the "value" of the expansion pay for itself
[3:56:31] Collected1: oh my god 120 levels. how did we survive that.
[3:56:45] i_wish_southbadboy: 100
[3:56:46] Kinghorn: stat squish for sure
[3:56:48] rudericus: anh hp/dmg squish
[3:56:49] Thoreya: Prob to 100 then back down again
[3:56:51] geokouts: just select your favourite expantion and enjoy the leveling and dungeons :)
[3:56:52] Kisswani: 100 is fair
[3:56:52] dracullus: especially since leveling was pretty slow between scalling in 7.3.5 and 50% buff in 8.3
[3:56:53] ekologiisk: they should offer a boost that costs $1 and u get 1 level (its the same but i think more will buy them)
[3:56:54] Incredible_Sausage: that new preach wow vid was really good. lots of insight
[3:56:54] MILESkg21: Collected1 alot of alcohol or worse 4Head
[3:56:55] Kinghorn: numbers are already starting to skyrocket again
[3:56:55] NavalRainDrops: 100 id say would be max
[3:56:57] Tiko119: I think they will do level 100 and either shrink again or come up with some other system to not raise level anymore
[3:56:57] temp3st98: probably after 100
[3:56:59] abracka_: 70 should be the highest it goes
[3:56:59] Nokterian: dont forget we had expansion we only gained 5 levels not 10
[3:57:02] the_general01: i mean, we're still behind classic in levels i think weve got a bit
[3:57:05] Finansdepartementet: I dont see a reason for a lvl squish tbh
[3:57:05] belfastcl: by 80 numbers start getting out of hand
[3:57:06] Baaltaza: @Collected1 It wasn't that bad LUL
[3:57:06] SinanUnver: The Preach video was awesome about blizzard man, regained my faith in Blizzard @Towelliee
[3:57:06] Collected1: i still don't understand why the cap was raised with DF
[3:57:10] justagamingfiend: im sure they will have it match whichever classic version is out
[3:57:14] MightyKeyboard: Are you going to level in war mode come launch?
[3:57:28] Thoreya: I like leveling idk
[3:57:29] remixonfire91: they could do a mastery system after max level like GW2 but i dont think they will
[3:57:31] Arocian: will next expansion be before 20th anniversary or on it?
[3:57:33] martianxl: I was hoping DF would be level 60 with a  system wosrt like ESO.
[3:57:36] Thoreya: I think 70 is cool#
[3:57:43] MILESkg21: couldve kept it at 60 and just used scaling
[3:57:51] Moobot: all_mystro, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:57:55] Kisswani: to be honest , i want cap to increase with each expansion . there's something about gaining those extra levels

[3:59:09] Thoreya: Legion numbers were a little absurd lol

[3:59:35] Darthsmash: Legion DPS numbers were great
[3:59:36] Finansdepartementet: i love the big fuckin numbers

[6:31:54] Hupu_a: did they remove the picking in flight form
[6:31:54] Velanthos: kinda, they only have a chance to find rares materials by like 2% i think
[6:31:57] PapaPing1: @Towelliee  So da 411 dis envoke collects dem fat sacks huh?
[6:32:02] altair19992: first DH took Meta from warlocks; now Evoker taking herbing from druids KEKW
[6:32:03] Aruce: spec far enough into the gathering trees and you can gather on  your dragonflying mount regardless of class
[6:32:15] manmower: everyone is getting picking in flight i think
[6:32:22] AlphasaurusRexx: you cant flight form in DF zones
[6:32:38] AnotherCheche: druids dont have flight forms for df afaik
[6:32:39] Velanthos: because gathering can be done on your dragon with enough knowledge

[6:33:32] DeanoTV: @xdthreat probably or arms warrior
[6:33:33] Velanthos: all the gatehring has gather while riding

[6:51:44] ZeusDNA: They'll probably forget to put the talent abilities on their hotbars after importing LUL
[6:51:52] Jus_meeeca: have a list of all  your addons?
[6:51:54] MILESkg21: going from the 99% to the 1% from loadouts would be magical
[6:51:56] Kineticbomb: Stop being so negative about good changes people.
[6:51:57] iamWaritself: iamWaritself subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[6:52:01] lawles_walrus: "because of this import system i went from bottom DPS to top of charts"
[6:52:04] PvtHudson093: but they arnt learning they are just getting it handed to them without understanding why the loadout was chosen
[6:52:04] dblackker: what's the TLDR on the changes?
[6:52:08] skydollnoa: i disagree. when they are brainless dead i still have to heal them through the fire because i dont wanna fucking die
[6:52:26] ellgrad92: if you rename it you do
[6:52:27] BlewGamingGroup: im sure someone will come out with an addon to save spec/button layout at some point
[6:52:30] Queenleaf: hi
[6:52:33] spacemunky114: yeah true lol, overall I think it's an awesome thing but some people just don't want to look at and configure a talent tree and adjust playstyle accordingly
[6:52:36] Zivs: on what changes @dblackker
[6:52:40] TheBeastofCaerBannog: Preach

[6:53:08] Whoracle1337: like preset them
[6:53:12] dblackker: @Zivs the build stuff discussed
[6:53:15] skydollnoa: i rather them not be brainless with the wrong talent and not stand in stuff that will kill them
[6:53:19] LeDerpski: yes
[6:53:21] altair19992: who said that
[6:53:24] tyler2tall89: I usually make my own build first, then compare to what others are doing on Wowhead/iceyveins after.
[6:53:28] richardmu: @Towelliee the addon Talent Tree Tweaks is great
[6:53:44] Velanthos: @skydollnoa but that didnt happen before soooo.....

[6:54:04] skydollnoa: @velanthos this is true
[6:54:14] spacemunky114: for my bear tank I imported a layout, went through and kind of cherry picked what works with how I'm used to tanking
[6:54:28] skydollnoa: actually question for assaination rogues, do u get serrated bone spike or sepsis?

[6:56:15] PvtHudson093: M+ is going to bun with no one having kicks
[6:56:18] Chiraakitteh: What’s brainless, the tank who was well geared doing the new dungeon but pulling so much the healer kept dieing? The healer was just barely geared enough to be in there. I’m sure he didn’t think he was a brainless bad, but he slowed down the entire dungeon because we only had one dps doing more than 4 k on his huge pulls in addition to the healer barely being able to keep up. Sadly couldn’t off heal since I was on my hunter.
[6:56:30] Eviltuna13: I was forced into spec into a int as BM to get MD
