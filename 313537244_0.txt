[1:18:13] Dinguslordx: @empioxd Why bring in some random “professional” when they could bring in someone from the community that people know/like? Especially if they are doing a good job.
[1:18:19] djriko87: @empioxd nobody who EVER has started doing interviews is professional...should be happy to see someone that actually plays the game and knows the game doing the interview rather than some "journalist" who frankly just doesn't care. people with that type of mentality is just sad, when the community doesn;t support the community.
