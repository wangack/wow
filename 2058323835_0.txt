[0:39:18] grimzero617: Pika what's going down?! Best day of the week baby!
[0:39:23] drfeltgood: @celipra85 @Pikabooirl told me to not make it 18+ because that excludes the kids that steal their parents CC info and buy subs and make dono's.
[0:39:25] Metexora: Did you ask for the Kim Jong-Un special LUL
[0:39:25] kswissbaby: you should log on your SOD rogue to start getting rested xp

[0:41:51] Nickb92003: also remember if your going to the gym to lose weight, you might have lost fat and gained muscle.. muscle weighs more than fat so weighing more is normal!
[0:42:12] Syrasmine_OCE: Honestly if I ever wanted to become a muscle mommy and bulk I could definitely do it with the amount of carbs I can put away.
[0:42:17] drfeltgood: I'll prob do react shit with some sub-par WoW game play and  and just chit chat...maybe a "Stretching Stream "
[0:42:25] hemm__: man I gotta go to a crab feed tonight and I just want to keep drinking beer at the desk

[0:47:06] Syrasmine_OCE: It does. I watch VALO streamers and they have to because of stream snipers all the fucking time.

[0:49:17] BzraHax: Don't tell people to stretch it out bro, it doesn't go back after a while XD
[0:49:39] brandonnnnnnnnnn: Thats what I'm saying. When I die they should study my body to figure out what not to do.
[0:50:08] tonjuras: i think just going out for walks for like a half hour or so a day could help a good bit with weight loss and be less stressful on your joints. its probably not super fast results but should def work
