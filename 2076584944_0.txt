[4:25:03] christopherNATO: I once found a cave. The cave was dark and deep. Stumbling upon it I was afraid at first. But the adventurer in me wanted more. I ventured into the first part of the cave. It was like a jungle with brambles and thorns all over. It took my utmost courage to continue from here.. once I musted the courage I kept going on... the next thing I met was the tightness of the slim passageways the cave led to. I barely smithered my way through, only with the help of the weird substance home to this cave.

[6:36:39] flop: 2 days ago
[6:36:39] wizzo4: they tried killing it 3 days ago
[6:36:41] niveous_a: they had help from GMS the 2nd time around

[6:37:44] simzz9999: @subsonic_eye true its was flop idea to do that I was watching the stream yesterday
[6:37:45] flop: i think being in range of kill will allow ppl to see a vendor that sells it
[6:37:45] lilpaulyg: i r mage
[6:37:46] baldnfattv: drops ranged spec runes for hunters
[6:37:48] Iodobol: prob drops 20 silver
[6:37:50] Bluegent: get lil gups ass on
[6:37:51] flop: the mount says its "refundable" when datamined

[6:38:44] baldnfattv: 100% speed
[6:38:48] flop: there is a secret cave in stv ppl found
[6:38:49] scarlboro: the theory was it was sold from an NPC in STV for years and years so maybe they actually added it
[6:38:51] AlphaSimply: yeah account wide is cap

[6:39:33] bonziatv: or just the person who tagged it
[6:39:35] bonziatv: i dont understand
[6:39:36] ripinpeace10: @Bean imagine how insane retail pvp could have been if we had these devs/?
[6:39:38] elementzia: or its world boss loot like a chest

[6:39:41] Shablagoosh: oda von
[6:39:41] Nathanew321: probably meant for 60s to do it
[6:39:43] niveous_a: theres no tag , everyone kind has it
[6:39:45] Iodobol: maybe its individual loot w a chance to get it
[6:40:04] overheatedx: the datamined mount for sod is a blue mount tho
[6:40:07] OZZIDA: the SoD datamined one is rare
[6:40:09] vash61: there was no tag both alliance and horde could get tag too
[6:40:10] scarlboro: so many different layers
[6:40:16] scarlboro: you can get a personal layer
[6:40:19] recklessnesswin: imagine getting it and not being able to use it lmao
[6:40:29] scarlboro: at 60 you would need like 20 people
[6:40:30] baldnfattv: na we got it to the enrage with 60 ppl
[6:40:36] dosia530: its a reason to keep doing bloodmoon at 60
[6:40:37] ripinpeace10: @Bean there was a gm in game helping the raids kill it
[6:40:40] overheatedx: i have a feeling its not gonna drop shit KEKW

[6:41:05] subsonic_eye: I’m gonna solo it
[6:41:08] overheatedx: yea t might do somethin
[6:41:15] overheatedx: spawn a new vendor like u said
[6:41:19] overheatedx: that would be cool
[6:41:23] lootamah: apparently it also got healed for 20 mil some how
[6:41:24] bonziatv: need tranq shot?
[6:41:25] bonziatv: maybe
[6:41:29] scarlboro: they either gave it too good of rewards or didn't add any rewards yet so they stopped it
[6:41:30] bonziatv: who knows
