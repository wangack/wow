[0:08:12] osgood_shatter: You was pres in season 1 right? You happy to go back in season 4 or avoiding like the plague?
[0:12:04] paul1008_: I think they use it to group mobs
[0:12:09] paul1008_: I've seen Kira call for it on occasion
[0:15:18] mTwSunde: whats that ring tone sound lol
[0:15:30] yctnm: weakaura alert for afflicted
[0:15:47] mTwSunde: ty
[0:16:40] keenxp: xdd
[0:24:19] naughtynurse123: i love how jb geared every single healer at the start of all 3 df seasons just to end up playing rdru anyway
[0:24:38] Simkha: You should die to the fire, would be funny Kappa
[0:24:43] anaya909: hey jb
[0:24:46] anaya909: don't fall off the bridge
[0:24:48] toxicraid: i picked this strat up from the loading screen
[0:25:36] jenkinsdonuttv: Disc? I prefer Vinyl
[0:27:15] silentkillervgc: @naughtynurse123 this week = perfect week for gearing alts
[0:30:28] Rezz2024: your paladin has crusader aura on @jdotb
[0:32:06] Morgandt: what PI WA is he using?
[0:32:29] onstinger: hello
[0:32:42] Korentice: no he had it on during the boss

[0:35:31] jenkinsdonuttv: Me when I pug Yazma on tyran: catJAM WHY AM I DOING THIS catJAM
[0:36:28] JustTipu: hard cast flash heals Sadge
[0:36:51] Morgandt: use rapture
[0:37:21] toxicraid: @jenkinsdonuttv YEP
[0:37:27] Flexosaurus_MP: Do you like disc more than resto druid?
[0:37:38] JustTipu: hence the " Sadge "
[0:38:15] JustTipu: you have binding heal
[0:38:29] JustTipu: so flash heal heals yourself aswell and gives you the 10% dr aswell
[0:38:53] JustTipu: disc life is rough
[0:39:56] Morgandt: Hold Pain suppresion until the overlap?
[0:40:09] JustTipu: i saw zaelia drop twilight equilibrium for DA in certain keys
[0:40:12] Flexosaurus_MP: I have a resto druid question...how do you use adaptive swarm
[0:40:23] keenxp: dextus incident Aware
[0:41:01] Flexosaurus_MP: Do you only send on enemies and throw it on your team if ur say running from pack to pack and it's off cd
[0:42:54] MBG_95: soulrend is every 40s
[0:43:55] Whitewolf1441: hows it going jb
[0:44:50] Whitewolf1441: do people know you in eu?
[0:44:59] Flexosaurus_MP: U prefer convoke over tree for high tyran
[0:45:01] Gabeko: need more subs for heat
[0:45:25] Pilha390: Hi jd
[0:45:45] Morgandt: this week is fucking hell
[0:45:45] pupperrss: If I play every healer to like 3300 IO every season, but I never can seem to figure out resto druid. Is it a skill issue?
[0:45:58] Flexosaurus_MP: Could you show talents one more time
[0:46:03] ren0m: Heating depends on IO gained
[0:46:51] Pilha390: @jdotb can you give me some advises as holy Pala on dg's
[0:46:59] Pilha390: ?
[0:47:05] pupperrss: I understand ramp, but I can never figure out DPSing on it. like Disc is EZ, pres is EZ, Paladin is ez but When I hot and then swap to cat people just start dying in 20+
[0:47:05] Whitewolf1441: are you saying resto is hard?
[0:47:54] bumpledore: lifebloom on 2 targets always eflo down always and have a hot on others for swiftmend
[0:48:07] pupperrss: It seems a lot more APM than everyone else
[0:48:17] pupperrss: Even when ABCing with disc and shit
[0:50:45] Whitewolf1441: i feel like swiftmend should be buffed
[0:50:46] socrates529: @jdotb Iâ€™m having a hard time healing tree boss in waycrest on 27-28, any advice now how to make healing thorns easier ?
[0:51:25] swo12: not enough dopamine when you click on a health bar and it doesn't go up
[0:51:39] PinkTaricFTW: Keeping HoTs rolling is fun. Catweaving for DPS is what turned me away from it in M+ after years of maining it in raids...
[0:51:40] ren0m: Does monk play like a holy pala? In terms of having to melee. I've never played the former.
[0:51:58] fufulover: is it just me whos stream is f'ing?
[0:52:06] PinkTaricFTW: @fufulover it is for me too
[0:52:08] camshreds: @fufulover yeah it's cutting out
[0:52:12] Thatsafy: @fufulover yeh got some weird glitching
[0:52:24] ren0m: @fufulover Same here
[0:52:32] ren0m: I though it was my internet
[0:52:36] fufulover: same
[0:52:42] fufulover: yep
[0:52:45] Whitewolf1441: oh thought it was just me
[0:52:45] ren0m: Every few seconds
[0:52:56] fufulover: its like glitching/freezing
[0:52:57] ren0m: Like if I had slow internet
[0:52:59] Thatsafy: audio fine on my end but video was glitching
[0:53:01] PinkTaricFTW: Visual artifacts and drops for a sec or two @jdotb
[0:53:03] Whitewolf1441: skipping
[0:53:03] camshreds: pixelation (drake voice)
[0:53:06] JustTipu: tiny buffers
[0:53:10] socrates529: freezing
[0:53:15] Survo_PC: thought it was me
[0:53:22] PinkTaricFTW: it's good now
[0:53:37] fufulover: seems good now
[0:54:05] JustTipu: might just be a twitch issue
[0:54:06] ren0m: YT seems fine
[0:54:08] Raethus_WoW: you keep buffering for me tho
[0:54:12] Flexosaurus_MP: Could u show talents one more time
[0:54:13] PinkTaricFTW: I think it was flying up and down in that area perhaps? :D
[0:54:59] fufulover: @Raethus_WoW must be you connection, its fine for me now
[0:55:05] fufulover: your*
[0:55:24] Raethus_WoW: it's fine now but drop s to 360p randomly
[0:56:06] bumpledore: i refreshed
[0:56:10] bumpledore: it worked
[0:57:22] face2face: Hi cutie how's stuff
[0:58:31] face2face: Real
[0:59:14] PinkTaricFTW: @jdotb happened to me when I moved: I plugged the whole thing in called the ISP asked them to send internet. They said "Nope, engineer will come in 4 weeks". When the engineer finally came, all they did was call their office and say "all ok, send the internet through"...
[0:59:50] TwitchTronikk: looking to start my first healer class, is resto druid easy to learn?
[1:01:00] PinkTaricFTW: @TwitchTronikk I dont play high keys, only 17-20s, but in my opinion, the easiest to learn is the healer you enjoy playing. They all will require some getting used to and people will die while you learn. Just be ok with that :D
[1:01:56] PinkTaricFTW: Currently I am learning and enjoying Disc a lot. But it's very much unlike any other healer
[1:02:35] ren0m: @PinkTaricFTW So I should just run it down for the first week to learn? :P
[1:02:36] Raethus_WoW: god, i came back recently and the ppl playing on low keys <20 are such bads they don't even know dps can dispel the afflicted as well lol had real struggle
[1:02:58] ren0m: I've gone to just two M+s because I have no idea how the new dungeon mechanics work.
[1:03:19] PinkTaricFTW: @ren0m I honestly and unironically think "yes" :D To learn to deal with shit hitting the fan, you need to be in situations where shit hits the fan :)
[1:03:21] ren0m: So the plan is to play my mage to learn and then swap to healing
[1:03:24] rebound_ttv: @Raethus_WoW I had an WA that yells at me when the pre-key ready check goes out so I can talent into dispels
[1:03:24] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:03:54] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[1:03:55] ren0m: How many phones and cats do you have? @jdotb
[1:04:16] Raethus_WoW: like sometimes i need to save my dispel for a mechanic or tank, and end point just healing the two afflicted lol
[1:04:44] PinkTaricFTW: @Raethus_WoW you can't even imagine how much I feel that :D
[1:04:46] Raethus_WoW: @rebound_ttv Thank you for your service =P
[1:05:17] rebound_ttv: @Raethus_WoW I key as Enhance, Poison Totem FTW
[1:05:40] Raethus_WoW: yeah shaman make it so much easier, if he knew poison dispel totem actually works
[1:05:42] PinkTaricFTW: Today in a 17 I had shadow priest (who took the dispell talent) stand there and spam-healing the affix instead of just dispelling it :)
[1:06:15] PinkTaricFTW: I was happy they tried to help...but it was kind of a waste of time
[1:07:20] Raethus_WoW: i dunno, i think should make it clearer  that the add can be dispelled by any dispell
[1:07:31] Raethus_WoW: i blame blizz UI =x
[1:07:35] Kyocere: this guy needs a health nerf
[1:07:59] ren0m: did the stream freeze again
[1:08:06] OffBeatOddity: nope
[1:08:39] PinkTaricFTW: But yeah, coming back to the "which healer is easiest to learn" - I can't pump out as much pure healing on any healer as much as I can on a druid. But I do literally 0 DPS on it outside of DoTs...Disc though - I can't pump out as much healing on it (still learning), but at the same time, I do decent amount of damage and don't want to shoot myself
[1:09:01] sullym22: @PinkTaricFTW This is kinda scummy mocking someone who was trying to help with affix when most people in 17's dont lol
[1:09:42] fufulover: EZ
[1:10:05] PinkTaricFTW: so to me, healing ease is all about comfort on the class
[1:11:12] fiftiforinti: 1 man DIE :D it is gg :D
[1:11:15] Raethus_WoW: don't worry about dpsing until you feel you have things under control, most pugs don't have it so i rather keep healing and dots on downtime
[1:11:35] Raethus_WoW: Or you have a good group then go nuts
[1:12:37] xarker1: I just got my monk to max level and that one is a blast to heal on
[1:13:31] mTwSunde: would you ever play holy pal again in raid ?
[1:13:43] mTwSunde: just got an ad...
[1:14:40] snowarden: its ok he did the skip so u all good now

[1:18:33] Jemba: OMEGALUL
[1:18:36] Raethus_WoW: lol
[1:18:43] OffBeatOddity: it be like that sometimes
[1:18:43] Whitewolf1441: is there no wa for this?
[1:19:49] Whitewolf1441: i hate bosses with soft enrages, also phases
[1:20:30] Raethus_WoW: there was a wa for it. blizz broke it
[1:20:58] Tfos: isnt this depleto?
[1:22:24] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[1:27:50] Tfos: shitty
[1:27:50] Tatuli: and he still has mana
[1:27:55] Beiskaldih: its more than 5 min
[1:27:59] Perry_TP: 5 minutes last boss
[1:28:04] Tfos: 5m+ i believe
[1:28:05] jenkinsdonuttv: It's not looking great
[1:28:15] Tfos: also 1 pack before last boss
[1:28:25] Jemba: its joever
[1:28:42] Tfos: you could tell its over after morchie
[1:28:43] gunethersnuf: I like having 8 min after 3rd boss
[1:28:50] Xenorphz: have you considered simply doing more dmg horseGe
[1:29:01] socrates529: stream is freezing again for me there
[1:29:05] Tfos: +
[1:29:09] sullym22: they need to take 5 mins off the timer from fall and give it to rise
[1:29:18] Kyocere: rise is prob the tightest timer
[1:29:19] sullym22: they are so umbalanced time wise
[1:29:26] Jemba: ye buffering from time to me for me aswell
[1:29:32] Jemba: time to time*
[1:29:33] Kyocere: 2-3 more mins from rise would be fine
[1:30:41] Beiskaldih: if you dont do insane pull with aug start, you lose dps i guess
[1:30:55] Whitewolf1441: your dps doesnt make a difference?
[1:31:20] BigPatty123: pog good morning jb
[1:31:37] gunethersnuf: Still doesnt feel as bad as going into yalnu with 6 min left knowing you wont time it
[1:31:57] Jemba: aggro
[1:32:03] Whitewolf1441: lol
[1:32:11] Xenorphz: Sadge
[1:32:15] Jemba: late spawners
[1:32:19] BigPatty123: i might be too high, that melee hit made me flinch irl
[1:32:23] sullym22: wp anyway
[1:32:37] keenxp: rise timer is tight for this season
[1:32:39] BigPatty123: *hits pen again*
[1:33:21] Whitewolf1441: im also down
[1:33:50] Whitewolf1441: good practice
[1:33:54] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[1:34:07] ren0m: That's how I learned how to do this dungeon. We bricked a +2 but I got to see the last boss in full.
[1:34:10] ren0m: Not my proudest moment
[1:34:26] Jemba: oof

[1:35:30] Whitewolf1441: do we know how convoke actually works? like what spells it casts
[1:36:15] Whitewolf1441: damn again
[1:36:20] Jemba: crushed
[1:36:39] Whitewolf1441: why does he reset aggro anyway
[1:36:45] Tatuli: how can he shield himself?
[1:36:55] Jemba: fyrakk trinket
[1:38:50] Tfos: maybe check some logs of timed runs to get grasp of timings needed
[1:39:37] CyonDru: morning JB
[1:39:40] Tfos: nah i dont mean healing - more of for you to know if key is timable
[1:39:45] Whitewolf1441: do you need to stack and move together?
[1:39:50] mimich: 71 raiders from mimich have joined! 
[1:39:50] CyonDru: Hope the morning has been going well
[1:40:24] Jemba: maybe wild charge
[1:40:32] Tfos: a lot would depend on route but from what i saw that tyr falls minute faster and morchie 3 minutes faster
[1:41:02] Tfos: 9:20 tyr 22 morchie

[1:41:59] FauniB: did you break 3.7 yet?
[1:42:57] Tfos: timed keys have last boss around 5 mins fight
[1:43:43] Whitewolf1441: wait why didnt you open the portal
[1:43:48] Tfos: ah okay thats probably where time was lost
[1:44:30] Tfos: that was prolly like 1-2mins lost in time cuz dps missing
[1:44:48] yctnm: I feel like the portal should open automatically if you all make it through
[1:45:02] Whitewolf1441: @yctnm ^
[1:45:25] Tfos: so 1 min missing is like 20m dps loss
[1:46:24] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[1:46:37] Tfos: thats huge
[1:48:16] Tfos: thats most likely the dps missing for 1 minute
[1:48:22] Tfos: ye
[1:48:51] Tfos: can I post links?
[1:48:57] Tfos: its 20m dmg

[1:49:31] Tfos: its diff
[1:49:33] Tfos: affixes
[1:49:43] Tfos: but tyra
[1:50:41] Tfos: gotta compared to best LUL
[1:51:06] Tfos: ok im on it

[1:58:08] Tfos: what was 3rd boss time?
[1:58:31] Tfos: they have anduin down at 28:28
[1:59:23] Tfos: alliance fight easier Kappa
[1:59:47] Zuxilon: Worse add cleaving on boss I guess?
[2:01:38] Tfos: 23:50 anduin start
[2:01:42] Tfos: looks like
[2:02:23] Whitewolf1441: can we see what youre looking at pls
[2:02:31] Tfos: ye thats weird
[2:02:37] Tfos: maybe log times fucked?

[2:08:53] zNzUV: yo god gamer wats ur opinion on preservation ? im loving the aoe healing in m+ @jdotb
[2:10:24] Tfos: 10m Tyr 20m Morchie key is timable
[2:10:52] ShiitakeMushies: evoker?
[2:10:58] Whitewolf1441: clunky is the perfect way to describe preservation
[2:11:05] Tfos: your tier set is based on luck so thats about it
[2:11:14] ShiitakeMushies: and the legendary weapon 0_o
[2:12:05] Whitewolf1441: uncharacteristically :(
[2:12:39] JukeboxHey: Will you be playing in mdi and timetrails?
[2:13:18] Whitewolf1441: youre harsh enough to be a coach
[2:14:06] punkekw: Tyr dead at 28mins should be good?
[2:14:28] Tfos: now MW this season?
[2:14:38] tumbro: noo stay on Druid :(
[2:14:45] CyonDru: swap to some disc or MW
[2:14:50] CyonDru: spice it up
[2:15:06] CyonDru: had any good keys on Druid this morning?
[2:15:14] Perry_TP: do for fun smile
[2:15:18] joffrey0101: blizzard not building a better search key UI is really irritating...
[2:15:53] Whitewolf1441: yeah we havent seen the last boss in a while
[2:16:00] Whitewolf1441: remember when that aug just dipped?
[2:16:27] ShiitakeMushies: is holy priest really that bad in raid? or are people just not playing it because disc is better
[2:16:36] Whitewolf1441: 28 tide?
[2:16:38] ShiitakeMushies: haven't played since the beginning of season 2
[2:17:16] Whitewolf1441: cant have 2 priests?
[2:17:53] ShiitakeMushies: disc gives me a migraine in raid
[2:18:37] Zalherbata: and what do you think about druid on mythic raids? i think mana issues makes it meh on the last few bosses
[2:18:37] Tfos: lets go redemption on rise LUL
[2:19:48] Tfos: also u have 21 fall should be easy like 24
[2:20:36] CyonDru: spec still will need an external
[2:20:57] CyonDru: i do pretty good but itâ€™s because I get an external. without that Druid is poop
[2:21:12] Zalherbata: yea i've counted it and it would make ~44k more mana per fights so like 3 more rejuvs or 1 WG
[2:21:24] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[2:21:27] CyonDru: voulk said it would be about 50k mana or so
[2:22:18] Tfos: anxiety about second or third boss in fall?
[2:22:19] Zalherbata: yea, depends on fight
[2:23:03] CyonDru: I trust in voulk
[2:23:04] CyonDru: prayge
[2:23:25] CyonDru: is that a little red riding hood helm you have on?
[2:24:10] CyonDru: oh word
[2:26:10] GeGeeWellPlayed: i'm pretty over affixes as a concept
[2:26:25] bahaoss_: hi :) what healer do you think is safest to pick going into s4? want to have an easy time finding m+ groups
[2:26:26] yesterday_potato: Whats the alt?
[2:26:48] yesterday_potato: Seems like it would be boring without affixes
[2:26:51] Whitewolf1441: jb are you serious about no affixes? do you think m+ would be  fun without the challenge?
[2:27:02] jenkinsdonuttv: Remove affixes and give us free anima powers when dungeons start xdd
[2:27:12] Whitewolf1441: @jenkinsdonuttv that actually sounds so cool
[2:27:25] yesterday_potato: we would be back to wotlk heroics
[2:27:28] yesterday_potato: snooze fest
[2:27:36] CyonDru: @whitewolf1441 there is no challenge to affixes. they are just annoying
[2:27:45] anaya909: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[2:27:50] drall743: pi mage is bad when double lust
[2:28:07] Soul412: Laser chicken gains so much from church man buff
[2:28:09] jenkinsdonuttv: @yesterday_potato Doesn't have to be the case. Dungeons can be challenging without having classes being soft-locked out of them for most groups in some weeks (like with afflicted)
[2:28:34] jenkinsdonuttv: It does come down to good dungeon design tho
[2:28:42] CyonDru: yeah I promise you affixes arenâ€™t making anything super hard
[2:28:54] CyonDru: they are just annoying and an old poor concept
[2:29:05] jenkinsdonuttv: @CyonDru Exactly
[2:29:20] REGENAROCKET: Seems like they mainly just healer filler anyways
[2:29:26] bahaoss_: like for someone who is new to heal, what spec would you recommend?
[2:29:29] CyonDru: then you cause more work for designing dungeons around them or require stricter comps
[2:29:44] CyonDru: like you shouldnâ€™t have to choose to dispel someone or an affix
[2:29:55] anaya909: 98% of the time afflicted isn't even a dispel cd issue.  it's finding them in a dungeon like WM where your camera is in the back of your head
[2:30:21] jenkinsdonuttv: Affixes made some more sense when dungeon pools didn't change from season to season, and even then it wasn't a perfect concept at its core
[2:30:31] Koodiijr: I had a guy talk shit on me for doing no healing on this fight and I just laughed
[2:30:44] anaya909: at worst it'll screw dispel cd.  at best it's annoying af
[2:30:55] Koodiijr: theres no outgoing dmg at all until burst and thats if you even get it
[2:30:55] jenkinsdonuttv: @Koodiijr This is the way XD
[2:31:06] yctnm: The 2% of the time when it is a cd issue, it's disastrous for me
[2:31:40] Koodiijr: @jenkinsdonuttv Dude I was cracking up he got one shot by standing in echo and was like WHY YOU DOING NO HEALING
[2:31:53] anaya909: tbh i can't complain about the 2% too much.  pugs have been helping way more lately
[2:32:12] jenkinsdonuttv: @Koodiijr Anything to not blame oneself xdd
[2:32:20] anaya909: other than an everbloom with my 60+ dispels, and a ret who did 4 at start of the dungeon, then never pressed it again
[2:32:30] Koodiijr: I was like dude read up on fights before you talk shit @jenkinsdonuttv  LOL
[2:33:43] jenkinsdonuttv: Flappy flapped his last flap
[2:33:45] Highscoore00: !pi

[2:42:16] ZeL77: Honeslty it's super hard to PUG on my disc. Im stuck at like 3350 and the groups only want MW/Druid
[2:42:36] Sokchoy: if youre a minigame healer you should be playing monk or druid  starting next week
[2:42:37] Kyocere: all these class buffs next week with those affix -- coincidence? i think not
[2:42:53] BigPatty123: @ZeL77 ill get accepted to a 25 on hpriest and get kicked because im not disc T-T
[2:43:38] ronnymexico: did I hear JB say earlier that he might be playing in the MDI?
[2:43:43] ZeL77: Yeah holy is not bad, just half the damage of disc I think
[2:43:44] Sokchoy: anyway @CyonDru i gotta go please tell joe dot bum that he needs to not play enduring lum like a moron
[2:44:14] BigPatty123: @ZeL77 idk holy can pump you just have to try too hard to do it tbh
[2:45:08] CyonDru: @zel77 they choose disc over holy cause disc is better at helping ppl live
[2:45:45] CyonDru: @sokchoy LUL
[2:50:49] dynamiclll: jb mention is he's doin mdi this season?

[3:17:47] ajax2323: swear a wog just tops it with the healing hands talent
[3:17:53] nellfin: spec PW: life
[3:18:13] Tfos: @ajax2323 dude he is DPS dont expect them to do something other than numbers
[3:18:54] Molbert_: None of the affixes are good. They need to rethink their entire affix pool and figure out something that's fun instead of annoying
[3:19:10] ajax2323: rets of all specs besides aug are obligated to press their util
[3:20:23] topazz12: good afllicted tkmiming at least

[3:26:03] ferilz: i think this is my least favorite dungeon on dispel week

[3:34:25] ajax2323: check rets dispels
[3:34:29] Tfos: @kelly_mac06 u saying that its weekend and he left his only braincell have weekend?
[3:34:31] nicoboot: The spirit on those boots is so disappointing
[3:34:36] kelly_mac06: fuck, i guess im not doing keys today then @Herkadess
[3:34:57] kelly_mac06: @Tfos LOL nah the joke is all hunters in wow share one or two braincells
[3:35:09] krinuk: how to get those extended borders on the loading screen :O
[3:35:14] nicoboot: Nelf > dwarf this season
[3:35:15] jenkinsdonuttv: So one can say dwarf is a... small benefit?
[3:35:19] Flippyyz: dwarf only feels meaningful in WM
[3:35:22] Tfos: ofc night elf is bis
[3:35:26] ajax2323: dht and throne maybe, but nelf got a lot of stuff
[3:35:41] ajax2323: like i have multiple times thought this season that i wish there were nelf pallys
[3:35:45] Tfos: or boss before
[3:35:48] kisokos3: @krinuk buy an ultrawide monitor LuL
[3:36:01] Herkadess: dwarf for tonks, nightelves everywhere else, and if you can't be NE, then u dwarf buuuut
[3:36:03] khazvik: do you lose the spirit when you use the catalyst, is that right?
[3:36:08] Tfos: or everychanneled shit u get and nobody wants to kick u can meld
[3:36:51] lazylad02: hello Jb TwitchConHYPE
[3:36:52] slushieze: how come none of the healer influencers are happy about the changes? like none of theun/jak/ellsemere are
[3:37:11] slushieze: yeah
[3:37:12] slushieze: the tunning
[3:37:15] ajax2323: the hpal disgrace buffs
[3:37:29] Nebulizer87: they really fucked us hpals and don't care
[3:37:38] ferilz: the rdruid ones dont fix a core problem w/ raid gameplay
[3:37:42] ajax2323: find an hpal that likes pressing sotr and ill show you a liar
[3:38:52] Tfos: @ajax2323 well what else u spend holy power on ? every other spender is shit LUL
[3:39:13] Patrikhg: they have been struggling healing keys tho just not raid
[3:39:38] Anderine: I don't think Jak likes the idea of playing lightweaver again
[3:39:47] Sizebot: I have no idea why shaman got those buff. The only thing they were really struggling with was mana. Damage and healing output was never an issue
[3:39:54] tabxzer: @Anderine lightweaver is no good

[3:40:51] TOASTMA5T3R: is ur party frames just elvui ? <3 @jdotb
[3:41:29] Snizzlenose: lightweaver hpriest in SL was real sleeper gameplay, no depth
[3:41:51] Ionized4: ST heals give the direct response to you pressing the button
[3:41:53] slushieze: love that about hpriest
[3:41:57] slushieze: idd
[3:42:14] ajax2323: thats the lay on hands experience

[3:43:06] miseria33: waiting for a good holy again
[3:43:09] Tfos: you still see hp bars move if u go virtue
[3:43:22] ajax2323: mw moves healthbars man, you press ehiluns or expel harm and those bars are UP
[3:43:39] ferilz: what do you think is needed to get rdruid back to enjoyable/impactful in raid
[3:43:52] nano1895: same feeling i had with rdruid, the grove guardian passive healing is strong but felt weird to play with.

[3:44:28] ottomr1990: I missed if you followed up on it but why do the sham buffs not make them more desirable in keys? what are they missing that would make them comparable to the top 3?
[3:44:30] Clawzx_Versatile: Clawzx_Versatile subscribed with Prime. 
[3:44:31] ferilz: grove guardians are just so.. passive and non-interactive
[3:44:51] Fameless_TV: hey jb, thoughts on pres evo being solid in the near coming future because of the tier voting in either raids or m+?
[3:45:17] Tfos: presvokers fucked themself for voting that tier set because it was nerfed
[3:45:32] frozenheartsqt: im 2600 disc.. I want to give holy a try but i fear ill just get no groups lol
[3:45:53] Clawzx_Versatile: theun is never happy...
[3:45:56] CyonDru: @ferilz imo itâ€™s almost as simple as buffing flourish. that and donâ€™t require a hot for swiftmend to be used, maybe bring prosperity back. nerf a bit more mana costs
[3:46:02] tabxzer: @frozenheartsqt becosue 2600 is so high and it rly matters what healer u bring......
[3:46:23] CyonDru: @tabxzer ppl want meta at lower io lol.
[3:46:24] imjustkyla: @frozenheartsqt As a healer, you'll get into keys at that level period. If a group doesn't pick you up because you aren't meta at that level, you don't want to be in that key.
[3:46:28] frozenheartsqt: @tabxzer People be like that no matter the key
[3:46:51] ferilz: yea cyon i agree on the flourish
[3:47:10] swikuli: didnt resto sham also do insane dps in s1? or do i not remember that correctly?
[3:47:16] TOASTMA5T3R: TOASTMA5T3R subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[3:47:23] Tfos: @swikuli yup in the end
[3:47:28] ferilz: it seems simple but they dont really want to address it.  Also hope they dont do this npc healing centric raid endgame
[3:47:28] Possitiviti: @frozenheartsqt also, very likely that they just wont notice that you are in holy and not disc until key starts :D
[3:47:36] imjustkyla: @Possitiviti exactly
[3:47:54] Clawzx_Versatile: windwalkers
[3:48:03] frozenheartsqt: @Possitiviti Yeah true, Ill sneak it in as the key starts lol

[3:48:29] fallendrakes: when is MDI?
[3:48:46] Hyposeidon: non bl comp in mdi?

[3:49:51] Possitiviti: @Patrikhg Why do you think?
[3:50:02] Patrikhg: do extremely well in big aoe
[3:50:16] Possitiviti: I see, than probably yeah
[3:50:16] tabxzer: @jdotb as a rdruid have u ever felt that ur healing isnt enough?
[3:51:04] TOASTMA5T3R: I have been away for wow for 2 years, did u stop the shirtless thing ?
[3:51:06] Snizzlenose: archon better than subcreation?
[3:51:25] zamow1994: frost mage should be a as well tbh
[3:51:25] Possitiviti: havoc not S anymore?
[3:53:03] Nebulizer87: Ret Stonks up
[3:53:06] Fameless_TV: Feel like a lot of the B tier classes just never get invited at all
[3:53:15] Fameless_TV: unless you're a ret.
[3:53:21] Nebulizer87: once i get my axe im just giving up on hpal

[4:08:34] Ysanada: yea back then you"HAVE" to use arcane in BRH, which is far better than fire mage for this buff stealing
[4:08:49] Ysanada: but then you will lose other 2 dungeons because you are using arcane mage
[4:09:52] vildaper: drjay was NOT arcane all dungeons when they ran brh
[4:09:53] vildaper: afaik
[4:11:05] Nytari: casualy shaming feral - best spec in the game
[4:11:38] ehmit: MW
[4:11:44] bubsiewubsie: elemental?
[4:12:04] Zingerac: aff?
[4:12:23] rezl4r: arms?
[4:12:26] Hota64: aff in in legion was cracked
[4:12:27] fromthecrypt55: Until next week, Ret gonna pump.
[4:12:51] Ysanada: assasin rogue
[4:13:07] tsumai: Frost DK comes to mind.
[4:13:09] Celestial990: dps DKs have always been bad for high keys
[4:13:19] Zingerac: MW was in MDI one of the MDI seasons
[4:13:21] stiefbruderrr: ele shammy
[4:13:36] toique: demo lock till now
[4:13:44] flawlesslykun: jmy on aff lock Kreygasm standing in shit on purpouse and not dying
[4:13:54] rezl4r: Ele was good in SL
[4:14:10] TheunGaming: i love that resto shaman will be kind of broken now but nobody will use one still
[4:14:37] Zingerac: ahh yeah for shrine skips
[4:14:53] Pwndepot1982: resto broken?  really?
[4:14:55] Zingerac: and KR were the big ones
[4:15:55] Hota64: feral was in s1 this season right?
[4:16:00] Hota64: dk feral spriest?
[4:16:07] nikator1: what about dev evoker
[4:16:13] nikator1: for shittiest spec
[4:16:21] Hota64: well druids have a weird survival issue
[4:16:27] Zingerac: dev is too new to crown shittiest
[4:16:42] TheunGaming: @Pwndepot1982 yeah it's already good
[4:16:43] xjacobtv: dev was also doing high keys before aug dropped
[4:16:53] lazylad02: WW monk
[4:16:53] McDeev: Affliction??
[4:16:59] Ysanada: marks is op back in legion
[4:17:00] rezl4r: SL s1
[4:17:03] Hota64: marks in legion no?
[4:17:06] Hota64: it was marks and bm
[4:17:07] Thoreya: shadowlands
[4:17:11] thrashlord69: mm hunter was good in legion but not meta
[4:17:12] Thoreya: s1 and 2
[4:17:13] Flippyyz: MM in S1 SL with NF ability
[4:17:19] thrashlord69: and its capped rn
[4:17:21] Ysanada: 45 yards dodge lots of aoe
[4:17:35] Hota64: i remember for legion it was meta
[4:17:44] Hota64: because you could out range xavius mechanics
[4:17:47] Hota64: on high keys
[4:17:54] thrashlord69: mm needs a rework so bad
[4:17:57] Hota64: and bait then and negate them for the group
[4:18:02] Perry_TP: gingi hunter erasure wtf
[4:18:26] Hota64: holy paly ran keys for 2 expacs im good if they arent good
[4:18:33] TheunGaming: what do you expect to see from healers in mdi
[4:18:40] Hota64: like hpal is legion was dumb as fuck
[4:19:03] Sathenus: warrior OMEGALUL
[4:19:18] Zingerac: are you competing in MDI?
[4:19:37] deerparkfish: will there be aug in mdi?
[4:19:41] swedishhousemafiaa: ur hair is growing out now
[4:19:43] TheunGaming: agreed
[4:19:46] somethineuw: wait I missed the holy pri commemy
[4:19:50] somethineuw: Comment
[4:19:56] Hota64: mage too good
[4:20:30] Mr_Dream9: right now ive got mana low woth rshamy 25fall on last boss , never gonna play shammy again, going back to mt rdudu !
[4:20:41] nellfin: 3x warr, mystic touch bis
[4:20:42] nikator1: its only warriors bm hunters and outlaw rogues that benefit from mystic touch right?
[4:20:50] sacresacred: Brewmaster lets go SMOrc
[4:20:52] nikator1: mm hunter too
[4:21:12] Whitewolf1441: @jdotb do you have a comp you wish was meta? and why
[4:21:17] iccyc0ld: Do you think Ret main stat being Vers is a problem? It use to be Mastery.
[4:21:25] Hota64: crazy mobility too and aoe lock down i could see it in the mdi
[4:22:11] Tfos: we doing 29s on priest now?
[4:23:31] Flippyyz: i could see this MDI having groups with no aug
[4:23:38] nikator1: shadow priest is recieving major buffs next maintenance too, maybe moonkin gets pi from shadow instead of disc
[4:23:46] Tfos: what do you enjoy more TGP or MDI?
[4:25:49] Flippyyz: going to be sad not seeing outlaw since its still target capped
[4:25:51] Ysanada: do you think echo will win again
[4:26:07] snse: ret ðŸ“ˆ
[4:26:12] sovica: what addon is this for dungeon finder :p
[4:26:24] Tfos: i wanna see some hugepulls with unholy doing couple mil dmg
[4:27:01] Zingerac: is that running fort tyran? or no affix
[4:27:14] sneezemar_: what
[4:27:23] Chazmiklmikl: was hoping for your return to mdi
[4:27:27] sneezemar_: what is the most cursed affix combo in the MDI?
[4:27:51] Zingerac: @sneezemar_ was a fan voted spires affix combo
[4:28:08] Possitiviti: excited to see pull everything onto the boss in fall
[4:28:52] sneezemar_: @Zingerac what was it?  i didn't play SL
[4:30:05] DogShitPaladin: Yeah but there's no sense of like a real race or fight in MDI, you can't push the same route a key higher to one up the other guy etc
[4:30:27] toique: necrotic bursting was aids
[4:30:54] FLICKPINK: you've got any tips for rise 27 to save time, apart from playing it clean?
[4:31:03] odeonx10: Ever remember teaming?
[4:31:30] doomester: i still hate Afflicted as a healer, cuz what do you do when you need to dispell in a boss fight as well as the Afflicted
[4:32:24] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:32:45] miiloswow: do you think some classes need an extra defensive? right now i feel like shit playing hunter and soaking up all the externals to live on most tyran bosses
[4:33:29] Tfos: DOTI will be shit for MDI cuz u cant pull mobs onto boss
[4:33:42] dezarathdh: remove random oneshots in m+ lmaao
[4:34:13] miiloswow: so like Mob health still goes up, but damage does not, as well as bosses?
[4:34:28] joffrey0101: I guess the question would be where we put the cursor
[4:34:44] zNzUV: @jdotb dat would make dps meta even worst bro i play ele shaman and i fear those words
[4:34:55] EriktheRed27: doesn't that put you further into the zmok 1 tank/4 healer range thought?
[4:35:05] zNzUV: i say put on more skill based mecanics
[4:35:14] toastbam: like wearing a tank trinket?
[4:35:39] zNzUV: if the meta is a dps meter its worst imo
[4:36:24] toastbam: but what about tyrannical. because i think bosses already live for too long those weeks
[4:36:29] flapybrew1: maybe remove aoe cap from some specs ? cua its cringe  some have it some dont
[4:36:52] Thoreya: @flapybrew1 u would see outlaw rogue 24/7
[4:37:22] miiloswow: yeah
[4:37:31] miiloswow: thats how i feel
[4:37:33] flapybrew1: i  mean  how u can play war when u caped at 5 ?
[4:37:37] toastbam: that happens on my surv hunter daily
[4:38:06] miiloswow: every 30 seconds lmao
[4:38:40] biocandyfps: @toastbam hunter is the squishiest class :P
[4:39:18] Vashanka_: in my time actually trying to push keys (probably s2 shadowlands on, i barely cracked 20s before) i think this season is the most oppressive tyrannical has ever felt to me
[4:39:25] joffrey0101: then now the meta becomes the 3 class which do the most DPS
[4:39:30] Flippyyz: you see the 7 hour DHT that was done yesterday?
[4:39:37] Snizzlenose: entering high tyra DHT monkaS
[4:40:30] Thoreya: so the cap is +25 instead of 31
[4:41:00] Flippyyz: 500 something deaths to last boss in 27 DHT because they couldnt live the Feed
[4:41:10] toastbam: @Thoreya i dont think it matters if its 25 or 31 or 8
[4:41:12] Thoreya: yeah but thats all people see
[4:41:29] Celestial990: some seasons world first keys were 25/26 in the past
[4:41:37] Celestial990: the highest key lvl is just random it doesnt matter
[4:41:41] Celestial990: whatever it is, ppl will get used to it
[4:41:45] CyonDru: thoughts on just capping keys @jdotb to like 30 and give rewards out similar to HoF raiding for first who get to it type shit
[4:42:04] ABarOfSoap: Maybe after a point it could reduce the timer instead of scaling difficulty
[4:42:16] Kerzor1996: thats actually a good idea
[4:42:45] Possitiviti: yeah that seems really cool
[4:42:46] f1ori: Like just decrease the timer for higher keys above 25, problems solved
[4:44:09] Snizzlenose: you can incrementally improve key speed, playing around one shots are exhausting KEKW
[4:44:55] TheunGaming: that is part of the reason why I like raiding way more than m+
[4:45:14] Lara_TV_: except fulminating on Rasz, that shit was insane
[4:45:23] Lara_TV_: p1
[4:45:51] miiloswow: yeah idk, id feel better if i was stuck on a key level if it was more about optimizing damage, but now i just feel shitty cause im stuck on a key level because i cant live something no matter what gear i get/put on
[4:46:07] Lara_TV_: But nah you right, raw damage of a single hit is basically never >= max hp the way it's intended to be done
[4:47:04] flawlesslykun: YEP
[4:47:26] flawlesslykun: and then shit like wearing pvp trinkets in waycrest happens
[4:47:27] flawlesslykun: classic
[4:47:35] dadgamer_o7: boomkin on rashok had to worry last tier I remember
[4:47:38] odeonx10: True
[4:47:41] Thoreya: i just think its tricky. this season is the most played in a while, making drastic changes like that could potentially jeopardize what we have
[4:48:34] abeldank: what about disentangling the health and dmg scaling of mobs from each other? 10% more health but 5% more dmg, something like that
[4:49:17] heychiefi: thats true haha
[4:49:59] miiloswow: you doing MDI this season?
[4:50:00] Vashanka_: i feel like this season is weird with the wall bosses in every key, where you've got one guy significantly harder than the rest - and then you also have shit like DHT where trash is RNG and the last boss is RNG and if you're not in a spot to tailor your comp to the keys they just feel terrible
[4:51:20] CyonDru: i think capping keys would be cool, first to who can go to 30
[4:51:24] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:51:37] dadgamer_o7: @jdotb do you think tankiness should be homogenized across all specs
[4:51:41] sneezemar_: if you don't end up doing MDI, I hope you costream it.  Was really interesting to hear your 2c last TGP
[4:54:01] Thoreya: hmmm
[4:54:15] joffrey0101: do you think it's more fun to not get invited because your spec does 10% less dmg than the top specs?
[4:55:00] ren0m: So you're saying mobs should deal %health dmg instead of flat dmg
[4:55:26] Thoreya: @joffrey0101 what keys u not get invited to?
[4:55:49] Thoreya: bc aug takes up one space, so what other 2 specs are taking ur place
[4:57:12] zoamonk: theres specs that have consistently been useless vs other specs, and i don't understand how anyone can praise blizzard on it's balancing.
[4:57:12] Nytari: what holy priest defensives?
[4:57:18] theVattu: they cucked desperate prayer
[4:57:23] theVattu: the talent
[4:57:41] Sathenus: fade 10% flash heal 10% up almost 24/7
[4:58:22] Sathenus: and you can shield yourself
[4:58:27] Sathenus: and then you still have desperate prayer
[4:58:32] Sathenus: and you have barrier
[4:58:35] nixar1: also flat -3% magic damage
[4:58:38] Nytari: thats 18% max just so you know
[4:58:40] Thoreya: @zoamonk gl making 36 dps specs always viable, literally saw feral druid and survival be meta recently. icant
[4:58:54] Sathenus: and you have pain supp KEKW
[4:59:09] toique: @Nytari DR stacks additively in wow
[4:59:32] Ysanada: holy priest is fine now, just think about back in Legion you don'tt have anything but the leggo cloak
[5:00:36] TheunGaming: what's your take on defensive power creep
[5:01:05] TheunGaming: i feel like we've gone WAY overboard to fix a problem in m+ that should have been fixed by capping the key level, rather than giving everyone 9 defensives
[5:01:14] SayNoToStim: but disc is the most squishy and has the same defensives
[5:01:16] TreeBoltz: the flash heal DR goes for disc too right?
[5:01:19] Phasedr: its very cool that half the healers just do 50k passive hps to themselves now
[5:01:29] abeldank: they're the exact same defensives
[5:01:37] nicoboot: Disc dies cuz we need to greed so fucking much to hit timers
[5:01:37] tsumai: Doesn't the death metric for Holy priests get messed up by Spirit?
[5:01:41] drewsky96: does this account for % of the playerbase
[5:01:42] Thoreya: @TheunGaming when what would be the reason to ever push keys lol
[5:01:48] abeldank: it's just hpriest is way less beholden to being forced to stand still to ramp
[5:02:09] Thoreya: if its arbitriary number sure, but if its capped, people wouldnt push higher keys bc theres no need to
[5:02:20] Snizzlenose: heal me peasants, im ramping
[5:02:50] abeldank: i think the real difference is that it's way more embarrassing to die as holy because you become a giant fucking angel and everyone in the raid knows the exact second you died
[5:03:08] SayNoToStim: holy can stand there and heal themselves easier
[5:03:08] zoamonk: is that not because there's way less holy priests?
[5:03:13] odeonx10: In raid disc is the most vulnerable DURING ramp and yes, most of the healers also like to ignore that moment btw. KEKW
[5:03:28] Whitewolf1441: wait how are shamans surviving so much
[5:03:28] CyonDru: @Phasedr sadly we dont
[5:03:40] TheunGaming: @Whitewolf1441 they stack vers
[5:04:35] AvadenWoW: rogue deadened nerves phys dmg 5%
[5:05:06] Ysanada: they compromise with pvp stuff
[5:05:30] Xastin3: verse also plays huge roll in damage taken profile
[5:05:34] abeldank: it was great playing rsham with like 30% vers
[5:05:43] Xastin3: verse dfensive bonus neeeds togo
[5:07:56] theVattu: I love it that I have rogue putting "50% vers" in notes :D
[5:08:49] Xastin3: your druid at 15% meanwhile hunter at like 2%
[5:09:15] EppatTV: just remove it from pve
[5:09:17] toique: Hot take! spirit/hit/expertise made gearing fun ruined by reforging
[5:09:53] Xastin3: they should bring back multistrike
[5:09:55] Flippyyz: see but for classes like Outlaw Vers is only stacked because haste/mastery are dogshit stats
[5:10:18] Flippyyz: so its just tankier than any other spec because haste and mastery are pointless
[5:11:23] Zingerac: verse being the best secondary stat is bad for a spec imo
[5:11:24] davaIon: vers needs rework... its just taking over as a dominant stat
[5:11:33] Xastin3: ver defensively just doesnt bad things to game for balance
[5:11:34] ren0m: !ui
[5:12:00] rouqle: I kinda miss the simplicity of the old talent system. That's probably just me
[5:12:33] papach0ng: @rouqle I agree with this
[5:12:52] Thoreya: @rouqle playerbase says otherwise
[5:13:22] flawlesslykun: i am actualy afraid of next expacs hero talents
[5:13:25] flawlesslykun: shit is actualy good now
[5:13:32] flawlesslykun: i don't want bfa all over again
[5:13:45] TheunGaming: the hero talents are not going to go well i dont think
[5:13:45] flawlesslykun: that's why i want beta asap
[5:13:56] Thoreya: imagine picking 6 talents and being locked in for 2 years LUL
[5:14:09] Thoreya: literally why they changed it, bc players hated it
[5:14:21] autismPRIME: lightsmith seemed really bad
[5:14:43] flawlesslykun: unless they bring back demon hunter's kamehamehaaaaaaaaaaa beam from essences, that one they can bring back FeelsOkayMan

[5:15:11] iccyc0ld: all the websites and resources make it hard for build diversity
[5:16:25] rouqle: just the WAYTOODANK look of it. Maybe there could be another way of achieving build diversity
[5:16:33] ls4sugar: the good point is that u have many many options than b4 ;p
[5:16:38] Phasedr: build diversity is a myth, the only "diversity" in most builds is swapping some 1% talent for another 1% talent
[5:17:31] Xastin3: tuning feels not thoughtfyk for most part now
[5:17:39] Xastin3: thoughtful
[5:17:43] Thoreya: imagine having bfa talents, even if its abtirary, choosing 8 talents is not it
[5:17:46] Thoreya: will never be
[5:18:00] Thoreya: which is why people complained for 10 years
[5:18:22] Ionized4: so many specs were also just viable in s1 and early s2
[5:18:54] joffrey0101: I just want to be able to take wild charge as a rdruid, this is such a fun talent and I can never take it now...
[5:19:12] monntuu: we asked how your coffee was
[5:19:32] monntuu: o.0
[5:20:01] Xastin3: so she got desert
[5:20:13] monntuu: yall got snow on the ground down there still?
[5:20:15] SWAGART_tv: LMAOOO
[5:20:27] noewon: in legion u had artifacts and legos, in bfa u had azertie stuff in sl u had covenants and legos. this talent system is better than all of that.

[5:22:32] weshallarise: high school energy lol
[5:22:41] Fameless_TV: LOL target danger zone

[5:22:59] Fameless_TV: starbucks in target
[5:23:08] Squats3: i took my son to "go get a treat" last weekend. We went to a chocolate store... i left spending $100 on 2 coco bombs and a box of chocolates... worst deal ever
[5:23:25] weshallarise: black tea lemonade slaps
[5:23:54] kelly_mac06: OH NO
[5:23:59] kelly_mac06: those are strong af
[5:24:03] kelly_mac06: bro that was a rookie move
[5:24:21] Richadin: great game
[5:24:21] kelly_mac06: oh hey i bet she's happy then
[5:24:25] Xastin3: im ready ffor chiefs game
[5:24:28] kelly_mac06: that was such a great game
[5:25:42] kelly_mac06: LOL that's me but im a saints fan so ive had practice watching them lose for most of my life
[5:25:50] kelly_mac06: can't be bitter when you have 0 expectations
[5:27:17] Xastin3: lol
[5:27:33] Xastin3: what really?
[5:27:44] drumminbacon: i'm a Raven's fan. And I have been for over 20 years. Joe Flacco broke the part of me that cares so much about winning
[5:27:52] Xastin3: you dont want to see receivers drop the ball?
[5:28:01] Zingerac: one good thing about the pats being bootycheeks is not having any expectations for any wins
[5:28:33] kelly_mac06: @drumminbacon damn i feel that
[5:29:24] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[5:29:46] Xastin3: its true
[5:31:34] Xastin3: chiefs lose when they decide to play inconsistant
[5:32:26] Zingerac: @jdotb my uncle DVR's every game for his team and deletes it if they lose
[5:32:43] Xastin3: interesting take. i very much like closer games more then games that are blow out
[5:32:45] Zingerac: only watches the wins
[5:33:19] davaIon: im a Lions fan.. i can relate to that mentality
[5:33:23] drumminbacon: I hate blowouts. two ravens games that i was watching this year they were dominating the other team so bad the broadcast swapped to a more interesting game
[5:33:33] drumminbacon: I was pissed
[5:33:39] lavacaestaenfuego: close games are only enjoyable when you don't care who wins or loses
[5:33:45] Zingerac: blowouts are much less stressful
[5:34:24] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[5:34:25] Xastin3: that was rough superbowl game
[5:34:43] drumminbacon: imagine being a falcons fan for that superbowl? yeesh
[5:34:48] Xastin3: ravens game too last year
[5:34:59] TTVJerbear: Are you from KC?
[5:34:59] Xastin3: both those games were stressful
[5:35:09] TTVJerbear: Gotcha.
[5:35:26] deerparkfish: im a falcons fan feelsbadman
[5:35:30] kelly_mac06: 28- 3 BABY
[5:35:37] Zacaree55: I feel the same way about my Sooners. But unfortunately they either blow people out or let teams that shouldnt hang around and nearly lose or lose.
[5:36:16] drumminbacon: @deerparkfish i'm sorry :( i'm sure seahwaks fans are in the same boat of constant reminders
[5:37:40] Xastin3: angry watching time
[5:38:26] drumminbacon: oh boy i had a similar things happen with the HEAT this past finals. 5 of us getting increasingly more drunk and salty as the game progressed
[5:38:53] Xastin3: i dont like watching teams lose to stupidity. if other team clearly played better then i dont feel bad.
[5:39:22] kaiserroll23: being a chiefs fan is like being a NA fan and watching the MDI
[5:41:09] Zingerac: was that the zach greinke days?
[5:41:13] drumminbacon: that's awesome.  that's a great October for sure!
[5:41:27] Xastin3: you were invested
[5:45:03] Fameless_TV: o7 JB
