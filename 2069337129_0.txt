[5:43:11] mylittlehombre: I’ve tried playing disc but man healing feels so bad right now. when every class has instant 600-1k damage how can you out heal that . only time I heal is when I have a 5 man
[5:44:57] Visioned: The biggest thing you have to rely on is the classes that you're healing also use their defensive's if they're overwhelmed. You can't stop huge burst at the moment. You also can't survive huge burst.
[5:44:57] Cahirs: Which SoD classes have best pvp survivability on its own? outside of tanks :D
[5:45:07] DeathToad007: warlock

[8:20:41] Kiroxx: warrior with paladin and priest in the pocket is insane, yes, but u need enabler
[8:21:22] Selecktt: Warriors WOULD have been insane in pve this phase, if they didn't give the bosses more armor than ragnaros. But they did so here we are at F tier in both pve and pvp.
[8:21:42] Mystiggo: good warrior with gear does a lot of dam tho
[8:21:47] Mystiggo: but those come around once in a blue moon
[8:22:34] Kiroxx: i struggle with pve roation. spike spike spike dot dot and thats how the cookie crumbles or what
[8:22:37] Selecktt: Oh well. Unless they decide to give bosses at 60 20,000 armor, warrior will rise again. Probably.
[8:23:53] Selecktt: @Mystiggo Yeah, but this phase because white damage is so low, rage generation is in the toilet. So youd need to build your entire comp around the warrior for them to pump. And this phase, it's more worth to build your comp around a fire mage or whatever.
[8:24:33] cougerbulo: you guys are crushing them!
[8:25:33] Kiroxx: i struggle with pve roation. spike spike spike dot dot and thats how the cookie crumbles or what or do i flay with chest rune?

[8:38:50] vantaro28: it hightsight 20/20
[8:38:51] jezzi23: don't think ppl realised it yet, but that 80% starfire damage buff is now working on spell power too (not just base)
[8:39:24] Mystiggo: yesterday we had a boomie spam 2.2k starfires in the raid

[8:43:02] tortis25: gg :D
[8:43:22] Griezyy: starfire critcahnce is the same it just does more dmg
[8:43:25] vegontoast: starsurge and starfire give crit to wrath and starsurge

[8:44:55] Mystiggo: well yea, I knew that starsurge benefits from wrath stuff
