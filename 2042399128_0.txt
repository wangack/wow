[1:22:58] AdamAlgae: 60 energy
[1:22:59] alexjmartens: mutilate feels pretty good
[1:23:03] itsWANDAI: Mutilate kinda big

[1:23:05] stefanmilic02: multilate is best fpr dps
[1:23:10] Rugmouse: mutilate and quick draw feels so fun

[1:23:29] alexjmartens: correct, you go quick draw and BTE
[1:23:32] cocopopsrockz1994: try it, alot of fun :D
[1:23:41] nikola420tesla: isnt shadowstrike kind of a must for pvp tho ?

[1:24:16] alexjmartens: @nikola420tesla the ranged slow of quick draw makes up for it
[1:24:19] Dutchlocked: yeah true but a slow dagger in offhand as well
[1:24:27] bassey_: enjoying the wpvp Savi8x?
[1:24:28] Dutchlocked: *put
[1:24:37] AdamAlgae: ideally, but it isn't that big of a deal
[1:24:40] Dutchlocked: ye
[1:24:45] fuzzywuzzyqt: @Savix do you have the warsong dagger?
[1:24:50] cocopopsrockz1994: no
[1:24:51] alexjmartens: poison ofc <3
[1:24:56] Rugmouse: 60 but two combo points
[1:25:00] AdamAlgae: offhand damage is halved anyway, it doesn't matter a whole lot
[1:25:02] ye1l: you still ambush yes, it does more damage tghan muti
[1:25:02] Dutchlocked: you do ambush if you don't have poison proc on target
[1:25:06] Tangents92: put poison on dagger
[1:25:19] dyanis666: whats up with judgement?
[1:25:25] fuzzywuzzyqt: Double cripping

[1:25:53] Turbonerd_TV: @savix any eu sod content planed you subpar Garthic artist?
[1:25:57] ye1l: but muti is lowkey a meme, when you don't have poison on target it actually does less damage than backstab and costs 20 more energy
[1:26:06] fuzzywuzzyqt: Judgement no long the main guild Arasaka is the main guild WICKED
[1:26:14] ye1l: like backstab is ALWAYS more damage per energy spent than mutilate, even if both hits crit
[1:26:19] Dont_Panic42: Ya i feel like Hillsbrad for horde and duskwood for ally are bad places
[1:26:29] AdamAlgae: Mutilate's only big factor is that its 2CP instead of 1
[1:26:33] AdamAlgae: It does way less damage
[1:26:35] ye1l: but muti is more cp yea
[1:26:41] Cheeezeburgerzzz: You left eu first Sadge

[1:49:12] Dutchlocked: I dunno tank rune shamans feel really tough to beat as rogue
[1:49:15] Norcore: @FreeStabs if you think this is overthinking it wait until you hear about starcraft ASL rules om
[1:49:16] Adam_of_Aurae: CatSpin
[1:49:23] FreeStabs: some people are trying to turn every single thing into something they can be offended by, even if it should be a positive thing
[1:49:24] Regalya: I used to be a rogue like you then i got cripling poison in the knee
[1:49:36] noose9k: When are you raiding this lockout?

[1:50:10] Adam_of_Aurae: 🐑
[1:50:16] j0llylox: Only way for shaman to beat rogue is if rogue disconnects
[1:50:34] ye1l: @balithos yes u can win using literally only quickdraw/autoshot/bte
[1:50:35] FreeStabs: @Norcore interesting, i know quite a lot about starcraft but never heard about that, just the guy that quit because of some hallucinations om

[2:16:06] ClinxyWow: ive never beaten a lock
[2:16:14] ClinxyWow: as rouge ofc
[2:16:21] darkusin_ng: hunters are easy for rogue unless u dont get mark in open world
[2:16:25] shard_icy: if your imp sprint mage is easy duel
[2:16:27] aoe_enjoyer: when are you going to HC solo some of these sod dungeons
[2:16:27] eike8989: imagine shadow on lvl 40^^
[2:16:53] Deadge_Gartic: savix can you do this irl WakeTheFuckUpSamurai
[2:16:56] Kiewicz92: mutilate is insane in pvp

[2:17:21] Tropicocity: @ClinxyWow probably cos you didnt roll a rogue Clueless
[2:17:25] ye1l: no its not
[2:17:26] Captnrex: i always liked slaughter
[2:17:27] StreamElements: If you enjoy the content check out my other stuff! https://linktr.ee/Savixwastaken
[2:17:35] ZIMdb_: bobka says backstab and slaughter is good but idk
[2:17:44] ye1l: mutilate is FUN because its new and gives 2 combo points but it's objectively the worst spec
[2:17:52] Yakku_: i mean, you can just turn your back and rogue cant backstab om
[2:18:00] Deadge_Gartic: savix can you do this irl WakeTheFuckUpSamurai  to celebrate your victory ofc
[2:18:04] ClinxyWow: @Tropicocity im saying i cant do anything to beat a lock as a rouge
[2:18:24] Tropicocity: @Tropicocity I was referring to people still spelling rogue as 'rouge' after 20 years KEKW
[2:18:48] Captnrex: nah :)
[2:18:51] thomasclaudepoker: yes, just have someone to summon on standby
[2:18:51] Kleik__: no
[2:18:51] StayDrew: no thats pretty cringe imo
[2:18:53] Tropicocity: but yeah warlock is tough, especially meta drainktanking your face lol
[2:18:55] darkusin_ng: no
[2:18:56] ye1l: no runes is fine, talents is cringe
[2:19:01] zi0qt: change runs but not talents
[2:19:04] zi0qt: runes*
[2:19:05] thatoneredguyoverthere: Host it in the Gurubashi arena, if late it will be forfeit Kappa
[2:19:06] FiryWynter: If they're late they forfeit
[2:19:10] Deadge_Gartic: make it runes savix
[2:19:12] FiryWynter: Having summons is on them
[2:19:13] Bellelol: runes is enough
[2:19:14] Deadge_Gartic: not talents
[2:19:15] AdamAlgae: Only change runes
[2:19:16] Tropicocity: 'duel' talents, get it? 4Head
[2:19:17] Adam_of_Aurae: hmmMeeting
[2:19:23] Gangrod: what were those sinister strike Makros?
[2:19:26] AdamAlgae: Reward picking a diverse build
[2:19:38] ye1l: changing runes gives them enough options per matchup, but if you're allowed to change talents it immediately becomes a requirement to have the biggest chance to win
