[0:35:25] johnnypoison69: 2.5s yea
[0:35:30] foxwinkle: yes the same as frost bolt
[0:35:47] daLuhz: i think the only niche of spellfrost bolt is it allows you to play frost healer with rewind time since you dont need arcane blast
[0:35:54] daLuhz: i havent seen anyone use it yet
[0:35:55] deltrexx: but it hits hard as chaos bolt
[0:36:11] foxwinkle: but you get more armor too
[0:36:15] deltrexx: na its joke
[0:36:18] deltrexx: same cast time tho
[0:36:42] mageguy8: elisBall spellfrost is bugged and gets double bonus from frost channeling I think

[0:46:36] Slesky: @SippinSimpSyrup ok...but how do you survive it in a duel?
[0:46:46] xNotorietyx: The hardest part for me in raid on mage is blowing my load and being OOM so fast. Great damage but oom quick lol
[0:47:08] Sqwibbie: @Slesky a lot of classes can easily outlive it lol
[0:47:16] MrDeadDorian: mage more aids than alock rn @Ziqoftw lol

[0:56:07] jhk97: @Slesky still mate, you need more gear, your issue isnt that mages are strong your issue is that youre undergeared, its classic pvp, gear matters alot
[0:56:12] Slesky: @Sqwibbie Im not saying Mage is gods in BGs or anything else dude...calm down, Mage is absolutely god tier in 1v1 though with Arcane Surge cheese
[0:56:24] Lord_Heia: Do you find paladins or shamans more of a problem in 1v1s?
[0:56:43] Slesky: @jhk97 didn't Ziqo just say 2.2k on  Warrior outside of BGs is decent HP? Like what
