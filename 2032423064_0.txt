[0:42:37] DarkBeasty_: LUL
[0:42:55] ubeentv: From my understanding LFR, Normal, and Heroic all have rolls. if u do on Heroic u get all the other rolls too. so no point running Normal/LFR fryak.  The only thing speculated that may help chances is clearing up until Fryak on LFR, Normal and Heroic, then kill on Fryak on Heroic. This is so you get all of those Gems that upgrade your chance that drop from the bosses before Fryak
[0:43:02] DarkBeasty_: hey this emote on the blanket

[0:58:18] Feisti718: the starter
[0:58:29] Lemon_King: HypeWave Good after day thingy Luxthos. Its time to faction change that Orc Hunter into a Mecha Gnome Thing Hunter.
[0:59:00] Feisti718: you have to make a living starter with flour and water and you have to feed it
[0:59:10] Velashen: Sourdough starter is a live fermented culture of fresh flour and water. You keep it alive and running. It helps to make the bread with a more mature culture.
[0:59:20] Feisti718: ^
[0:59:26] Feisti718: like kombucha
[0:59:31] Velashen: Exactly
[0:59:45] Feisti718: thank you @velashen

[1:08:26] FrankTheTank1988: @PaganReaper93 yeah boosts cost a bit :D it saves time tho, but as long as you have time. And with timewalking active it shoud not take that long to level if you keep at it. :)

[4:56:41] LohrX: thx
[4:56:49] 2Zeko: outlaw does again so great. ( still waiting for Unluxdoor to get to 70 :) )
[4:57:37] LohrX: I'm gonna be cheap with this new Warrior I'm leveling. Get it to 69 and pay for the 70 boost LOL
[4:57:59] LohrX: well not ncessarily cheap..its' like dumb and smart
[4:58:29] LohrX: I want the learning experience otherwise I'd pay for it since level 1
[4:58:39] ga3s: I advise macroing pet attacks also into multi shot and barbed shot. Turtle cancel aura will also be usefull on cobra shot! catKISS
[4:59:13] LazyPanzer: @LohrX Nice
[4:59:13] Megacheetah: REnown
[4:59:33] LohrX: Because I want to learn the spec
[4:59:58] Megacheetah: I'd do the boost for renown only
[5:00:00] Nokterian: @LohrX Warrior isnt hard to learn Fury is 3 or 4 buttons
[5:00:08] Megacheetah: EVen if I was 69
[5:00:08] LohrX: I'm learning Prot
[5:00:10] Nokterian: so many procs
[5:00:18] ga3s: Yeah, but if you also have it on multi shot, for aoe situation you can target mob in the middle multishot and your pets will already be on the optimal target. Little things haha
[5:00:19] Nokterian: Prot is the easiest tank
[5:00:25] Nokterian: also 3 or 4 buttons
[5:01:01] Nokterian: If you want a even easier tank Bear Druid
[5:01:15] LohrX: I understand. I'd prefer to learn it as I level in dungeons.
[5:01:42] LohrX: Paladin was the same, not hard but its more about just getting the experience
[5:02:02] LuiBMHunter: follower dungeon next week - make it so much easier to level in dungeons
[5:02:16] StreamElements:  Want to buy or fund anything for us to open, craft or build on stream? https://throne.com/luxthos

[5:02:50] LuiBMHunter: limit of 10 per day to start tho
[5:02:51] Ertra: so probably not great
[5:02:54] reggiepowa: surely not even remotely close to running dungeons with real ppl
[5:03:19] LuiBMHunter: @reggiepowa probably not - no griefers - no toxic players - gonna be better :)
[5:03:20] LohrX: Why would they put a limit on that? Are they worried it'll get abused? Isn't it just for Normal dungeons?
[5:03:46] reggiepowa: @LuiBMHunter I mean it will be slower, I'd take toxic players who can chain dungeons in under 10 min
[5:03:52] LuiBMHunter: probably to make sure it works and doesn't put to much stress on the servers

[5:05:00] ga3s: In general the most annoying part of bm is potential downtime on pets. So if you have pet attacks marcoed on your main 2-3 spells it reduces wasted GCDS. For casual gameplay what you have right now will be well then enough luxthoLove

[5:28:23] shale93: I tried +28 DHT and the hunter could not live the stomp from Oakheart without externals
[5:29:23] SylarSavage: @shale93 I mean, literally almost all classes need to use externals to live that boss. That boss even on lower mythics is one of the harder bosses in this seasson
[5:29:29] mentosz09: Had to go rescue my mother in-law and busted my ass in a 3ft snow bank
[5:30:44] shale93: @SylarSavage not on fortified, only he was getting one shotted
[5:31:35] Voidthos: I tried a 40 DHT and everyone died to Oakhearts stomp.
[5:31:39] SylarSavage: @shale93 Doesn't matter if its fort or tyran, he hits like a mack truck and almost every class in the game on a 28 would have to use externals. Dorki does them constantly and still talks about how bad that fight is
[5:32:17] shale93: @ShroudedFoxx nope they don't I run those dungeons myself lol

[5:33:31] SylarSavage: I can understand the ability doing a lot of damage if it didn't do it every 15 to 20 seconds.
[5:33:49] LazyPanzer: It should so it requires you to use a defensive
[5:34:49] ShroudedFoxx: @shale93 ??
[5:35:09] SylarSavage: yeah like I said, it's okay if it does it like once every minute. But once every 15 to 20 seconds isn't okay
