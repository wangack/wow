[1:35:10] ReSeT_VT: so they limited to 10/day and also made sure it's not the best strategy by nerfing xp
[1:35:29] IAttackYou: charge dorki extra
[1:35:34] IAttackYou: for being mean
[1:35:41] anaya909: guess it's just an alternative rather than a replacement then
[1:35:52] ReSeT_VT: from what i've seen on PTR, the NPCs teleport on you, so you can do some shit like stealth in and do a dungeon in 5 mins

[2:29:13] reppap: this week seems not great
[2:29:42] timur_is: @yumytv About the Russian geoguesser round. They recently (in 2018) allowed to use yellow dividing strip in Russia. It is used mostly in Karelia and Murmansk (northern regions near the Finland border). The sign was in Russian and English. They do translate those signs sometimes, but not always.
[2:29:55] Isonmat: how are growls wa's working? mine aren't and i want to do keys Madge

[2:34:43] timur_is: @yumytv that was the name of the river. It sounds Finish because it is close to the Finland. They are not great in translating signs, but it was meant to be English. "riv. Vite" stands for "River [named] Vite". I'm Russian and I know it looks confusing sometimes
[2:34:58] wazon_7: I see,  any chance to get ur bigwigs profile?

[3:04:14] t4pekid: or do i put myself through the flames
[3:04:25] anaya909: proving grounds is a good middle ground
[3:04:30] NickyNiclas: There is pretty much nothing to heal so you won't learn
[3:04:47] anaya909: infinite tries, no stress, and it's about tough enough to actually use your spells
[3:04:51] t4pekid: yea more like that
[3:05:01] NickyNiclas: Follower dungeons are great for setting up the UI though

[3:10:23] yctnm: no locks no woyers Sadge
[3:10:34] Possitiviti: Who else can dispell it?
[3:10:37] codemonkey194: Trusting pugs to help dispell (':
[3:10:55] yctnm: any type of dispel besides magic
[3:10:56] Ventorpoe: warlock
[3:10:57] nefurious: any dispel disease, curse magic
[3:10:58] ChargedParticle: Warlock?
[3:11:00] noewon: afflicted is such trash affix
[3:11:04] IAttackYou: ?
[3:11:07] IAttackYou: imp?
[3:11:14] IAttackYou: imp doesnt work on it?
[3:11:17] IAttackYou: Naruhodo
[3:11:17] supzfly: my main dps is a lock and i feel crap during afflicted weeks. least i can do both incorps on those weeks :)
[3:11:23] yctnm: no because imp is a magic dispel
[3:11:24] minkip831: imp only does magic dispel
[3:11:27] lowincomehooker: I wish I could change aff to look like incorp idk they are so much harder to find for me usually
[3:11:29] IAttackYou: ahh ok
[3:11:31] ChargedParticle: @IAttackYou no
[3:11:45] t4pekid: delete m+ Prayge

[3:12:08] supzfly: anything but magic
[3:12:08] IAttackYou: wild
[3:12:14] IAttackYou: i see
[3:12:23] codemonkey194: Sham poison totem is nice for it
[3:12:37] Liridel: then shortening the timer?
[3:12:52] noewon: any affix that makes you not want to invite almost half the classes is stupid
[3:12:58] tisiwonz: What about fall or rise lol there are some horrible debuffs
[3:14:42] IAttackYou: Growl, is the legend about the random picture true
[3:14:55] IAttackYou: what a chad move if it is
[3:14:59] lowincomehooker: fall trash by second boss is actually insane

[3:16:12] noewon: eksuS you are not a cat IRL
[3:16:16] trench_toaster: if timer shortened after a certain key level then score would just be based on how fast you went?
[3:16:26] itsvelvetta: @yumytv do i come back and play last patch or just wait till xpac
[3:16:29] trench_toaster: seems like instant disbands instead of completing a lot of pug keys
[3:16:40] IAttackYou: I swearched up Growl on google image, it was funny
[3:16:52] IAttackYou: https://www.thrivingcanine.com/sites/default/files/field/image/Growl_istockpaid.jpg
[3:17:14] maladendron: would time-only scaling incentivise non-healer comps?
[3:17:16] goldard: what makes me sad is that i have all keys 24 and i ont get inv for 25 at all
[3:17:33] goldard: and ill do 25 and the pugs trol quit
[3:17:38] goldard: sad things
[3:18:25] Shadostealer: tree man in DHT you think might be unfair?
[3:18:25] nulian: max damage cap
[3:18:30] IAttackYou: its true Naruhodo
[3:18:30] javybavy: some mechanics should just do % hp
[3:18:32] marionberry88: I feel like they'd never be able to balance it properly and you'd have seasons where nothing does damage when it stops scaling and mechanics are just permanently a joke
[3:18:52] noewon: mhm artisanal scaling
[3:19:07] trench_toaster: some type of flag per dungeon ability with the max scaling
[3:19:56] alyssaleanaxo: i thought this meant follower keys with ur stream
[3:20:02] javybavy: its the tyrannical problem, some bosses were clearly not made to scale that high on tyrannical
[3:20:18] alyssaleanaxo: oh
[3:20:20] IAttackYou: yes

[3:36:46] 1111111111112233: "if they think"
[3:37:03] IAttackYou: Growl has already believe its sentience
[3:37:07] IAttackYou: holyFUCKINGshit
[3:37:13] TaterTacoTots: @cucumbertoessniffa But, now we gotta track down cucumbertoes and find out what their story is
[3:37:16] lowincomehooker: I remember someone in WoLK yoinking some quest mobs from me so I put them on ignore and then like a month later they tried to message me in raid and was like "Ayo I am on ignore?...." that was awkwardish in Discord
[3:37:23] anaya909: so i'm wondering if you switch it, if they'll dragon ride with you
[3:37:57] IAttackYou: did you ever PVE in Guild Wars. You always pulled back
[3:38:06] flockheart: gotta be careful about the patrols
[3:38:11] IAttackYou: it is
[3:38:12] anaya909: omg dk's who stand way back and grip one singular mob.  so the casters stay put and hit whoever
[3:38:15] thepleasuremachine: tank was LOS'ing everything in uldaman

[3:38:26] IAttackYou: yeah, that was sick
[3:38:28] IAttackYou: the heros
[3:38:30] Noisillex: why are you playing the follower duggy?
[3:38:35] TaterTacoTots: you pull them back because you've  wiped one time too many to your mentally challenged pugs pulling patrols KEKW
[3:38:37] marionberry88: can you get them to wipe?
[3:38:54] IAttackYou: it all worked pretty well too
[3:38:55] flockheart: donki
[3:38:57] RamblingJosh_: for a pvp game the pve in guild wars was surprisingly cool
[3:39:01] IAttackYou: donki is toxic
[3:39:07] Chronine: KEKW
[3:39:14] gretriku: donki blaming the healer as usual
[3:39:18] ASimpleKatt: is mw really behing for high keys?
[3:39:24] ASimpleKatt: i really don't want to learn disc
[3:39:31] supzfly: i used to like swtor's version back in the day. if you were short members it would add your followers to the party (parties were only 4 people anyway but it helped)
[3:39:35] Dizi_Kash: hi got question for would you take 483 helm with avoidance or same helm 489 without as helm enchant scales. for keys 27+ and up on MW cuz really been thinking about it for a while
[3:39:37] daveisfaker: @IAttackYou dorki is ambitious but can be toxic sometimes too.

[3:41:22] bbrasky: algethar was so fun
[3:41:22] gretriku: RLP is a banger
[3:41:34] meatseekor: nokkud healing the 3rd boss before the nerfs were hella fun
[3:41:50] baseboned: you can't make routes in 6/8 DF dungeons
[3:42:16] meatseekor: they could have made the giant ass area before the final boss relevant
[3:42:22] carlos_the_7th: As a civilian I feel like routing is kinda annoying, sometimes it's hard to catch up or get used to some stuff people do in keys to save time, feels too sweaty
[3:42:27] guapo_uktabi: guapo_uktabi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! woot

[3:43:34] IAttackYou: AINTNOWAY
[3:43:40] IAttackYou: that would be miserable
[3:43:44] baseboned: I'm so sad they fixed vault skips, but this still works
[3:43:55] IAttackYou: wait are they just massacreing the villager
[3:43:56] baseboned: they're pulling hahaha
[3:43:58] IAttackYou: LOL
[3:43:58] marionberry88: D: he's murdering the villagers
[3:44:02] thepleasuremachine: pulling neutral mobs D:
[3:44:03] lowincomehooker: ping the map for them

[3:44:09] noewon: was that short cut. every one did it
[3:44:11] daveisfaker: it's official AI is evil.
[3:44:11] 1111111111112233: ninja pull to see what they do

[3:44:22] tabxzer: @yumytv Hasany fllower added you to play more after? And also I assume the folloer tank is better then dorki, when do you replace?
[3:44:23] warmishspace: They're out for blood lmao
[3:44:25] Helly89: u can turn off auto
[3:44:26] marionberry88: "we need these for %" - AI tank

[3:45:40] yctnm: HOLY
[3:45:41] marionberry88: that's actually crazy that the bots adjusted to not pull
[3:45:48] warmishspace: Nice
[3:45:50] spercles: why did I think this was a growl stream follower dungeon not in game PepeLaugh
[3:45:51] TheRealTarrjue: Honestly the fact that the tank just never stops pulling is already a step up from player tanks. They should enable this for m+
[3:45:52] MagnumCondomForMagnumDong: they will pull it like a trash mob
[3:45:55] anaya909: ya know what's fked up, people who learn from these are gonna expect tanks to do that
[3:45:59] marionberry88: yeah they shifted right to avoid the boss
[3:46:02] imjebb: a pug woulda already pulled boss. followers 1- pugs 0
[3:46:25] gretriku: worst fire mage ever

[3:47:52] SerFloyd: bis
[3:47:58] TheRealTarrjue: Will the followers do the mechanics?
[3:47:58] pidkid1: hey growl. have you updated your frames lately? i just imported the disc priest ones and my debuffs dont look the same as yours
[3:48:07] baseboned: is the ilvl the same as normal normal?
[3:48:39] Whitewolf1441: chat, anyone know why wa says "make sure you trust this person" when you import a weak aura?
[3:48:48] thepleasuremachine: WidestJigglin
[3:49:12] shanerdd: @Whitewolf1441 They can get your SSN and scam you
[3:49:18] Venrukis_Water_Elemental: @Whitewolf1441 cuz they can be malicious
[3:49:30] FREEZE_ball: @Whitewolf1441 There were WA's that sent all your gold to a player when you interacted with a mailbox
[3:49:35] RamblingJosh_: because spinning crane kick WA
[3:49:38] ripidark: @Whitewolf1441 You can write custom scripts to automate behaviour - there were some things like auto-gold trading etc.
[3:50:02] TheRealTarrjue: Why the hell am I getting a cat treat ad
[3:50:29] nilIie: you're watching a cat with a waffle on its head its pretty topical

[3:51:59] epilepticunicorn_: fyrakk prog Pog
[3:52:27] thepleasuremachine: fyrakk prison Pog
[3:52:44] mason_90: mostly m+
[3:53:24] Archaedius1: Pugging is easier, over the 23+
[3:53:32] TheRealTarrjue: 43 min is enough time for a key, just use followers
[3:53:38] mikehawkk45: did anyone ever consider maybe fyrakk just wants a smooch?
[3:53:44] TheRealTarrjue: Do a +5 it's like a follower dungeon
[3:53:54] dajeetv: how triggered were you about the shuib raid notes incident
[3:53:58] gretriku: @TheRealTarrjue with fewer interrupts lol

[3:56:04] cucumbertoessniffa: i was listening on drohgohs stream
[3:56:12] cucumbertoessniffa: LOL
[3:56:15] cucumbertoessniffa: guess that answers that
[3:57:03] thepleasuremachine: CognitiveOverload
[3:57:22] Whitewolf1441: arent you supposed to run into all the problems before mdi?
[3:57:30] TheRealTarrjue: Healer brain?
[3:57:42] noewon: mhm
[3:57:44] gretriku: im the same way. its probably a big reason why i fucking stink lol
[3:57:56] dreamlessLKY: sometimes its hard to problem solve when your raid group wants to chain pull when you want to take 3-5minutes to figure out how to live
[3:58:30] noewon: NOTED Soooo spam smite to heal. got it
[3:59:18] mikeywatt: CognitiveOverload
[3:59:26] turretjustt: I see priest cooldowns -> I press revival TrollAware

[4:00:03] noewon: ICANT just doesnt move
[4:00:21] TheRealTarrjue: He's the goat man
[4:00:38] gretriku: because hes the gigachad of all gigachads
[4:01:10] GGBrinks: disc healing reminds me a lot of healing in FF online... always be casting
[4:01:16] thepleasuremachine: avade brainblast
[4:01:22] baseboned: ok but you're comparing yourself to 2 of the best playing to ever play wow
[4:01:28] nekuwo: wait until p2 when you get caged during your sfiend
[4:02:01] dajeetv: he comparing himself to people that he regularly plays with not like he is some civilian
[4:02:11] gretriku: avade is so good that its unfair to compare yourself, or anyone, to him. hes the definition of built diff
[4:02:50] gevoratz: Did follower dungeons go online?
[4:02:52] TheRealTarrjue: Its like being a top physicist but you're still no bohr, fermi, einstein, etc
[4:03:07] The___Fast: that specific issue is a pretty common caster thing to think about I think, have to just like map out where you'll have to walk before the fight starts
[4:03:12] anaya909: it's a matter of not using the information you already know to do something better
[4:03:19] IAttackYou: FLASHBANG
[4:03:21] burne114: @therealtarrjue what was Einsteins io?
[4:03:30] anaya909: i saw zaelia baiting puddles on first boss freehold in bfa, and thought why tf am i not doing that
[4:03:42] RamblingJosh_: wonder how many pulls it took zaelia to arrive at that strat
[4:03:51] gretriku: @burne114 easy 3800
[4:05:06] Wisterjah: 5Head
[4:05:23] IAttackYou: Avade GIGACAT
[4:05:25] RamblingJosh_: it's because there is no hypotenuse in this equation
[4:05:27] Evaluablettv: hey man you get anything good in vault bud?
[4:05:32] noewon: Pepega oh dont stand there
[4:06:02] TheRealTarrjue: Did you try sitting on the dragon's back?
[4:06:31] Lynxiesz: hey, returning gamer... how do you gear through M+ now? you can get tier thru it?
[4:06:36] gretriku: thee lesson ive learned is to just become friends with dorki and avade NOTED
[4:06:44] Evaluablettv: pain unlucky
[4:06:50] IAttackYou: you should have taken leech bracers to parse in raid
[4:07:01] Kmork1: it was better in season 2
[4:07:16] KhanSoloTV: Prob order DoorDash better than Avade & Dorki though
[4:07:33] TheRealTarrjue: @khansolotv mdi skill
[4:07:56] anaya909: there's a quest next to fountain in valdrakken that sends you to catalyst

[4:10:37] Carameldasen: So i have  leaf of the ancient protect in my vault any reason you would want this over what i am currently using? (Sea start/blood, or sea star/root)
[4:10:56] harmless52: i am talking Furbolg to ppl at this Big Dig and its great

[4:20:23] trench_toaster: starving but need to wait over an hour to order
[4:21:12] mobbo: "rise of the balance druid" Well christ Druids have to play something if they want to play M+
[4:21:50] cucumbertoessniffa: shut up, meg
[4:21:51] cucumbertoessniffa: jk
[4:21:52] Ventorpoe: thats a big streamer take
[4:21:53] Kmork1: i agree
[4:21:58] marionberry88: def a higher level problem
[4:22:16] cucumbertoessniffa: when you arent good, there is always something to learn

[4:22:20] maladendron: i mean everyone gets capped at some level
[4:22:21] stikheals: some affixes aren't fun
[4:22:22] stikheals: '

[4:22:37] MierkaBlue: I play every week, but we do push more in the push weeks and we did time our first 24 this week
[4:22:44] Whitewolf1441: @yumytv how would you make higher keys more challenging without affixes
[4:22:56] Kmork1: i push on "bad weeks" bc better players are generally playing. and all i got for that is confirmatio bias
[4:23:41] cucumbertoessniffa: tettles.. high end??

[4:26:00] baseboned: "culturally they dont raid" is a weird ass sentence
[4:26:03] mobbo: @yumytv surprising Blizzard even cared enough to ban em... They didn't even let TW people vote on what tier sets they'll play with next season
[4:26:18] mobbo: unless they had a vote nobody knew about outside of the region
[4:26:27] marionberry88: "RMT is great" FeelsOkayMan 👍
[4:26:28] turretjustt: buys raid gear sells mythic key It just makes sense
