[0:41:43] tarth_100: hots and trees
[0:44:27] Zenlyn: do u agree with my fix for rdruid? - Make adaptive 1 purge, make trees unpurgable and reduce the wild growths healing a bit. i feel like the whole "Swap on hots" & "Just spam purge" has been lost coz there's a 1/10 chance u get a real hot
[0:44:46] brewtank: can we ban all priests from chat? @cdewx holy
[0:44:57] brewtank: no one specific
[0:44:58] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:45:20] zachgamegodx: @cdewx wouldn't pres with a lock playing imp dispel and a ret paladin playing sanc be op
[0:45:27] itz_killjoy: how bout remove tree , how does rdruid become a pet spec?
[0:45:28] zachgamegodx: oom everyone
[0:45:38] zachgamegodx: PvE heal
[0:45:49] nikthevoker: Hpriest > rdruid now right cdew?!
[0:46:06] heho1231: arcane mage lol
[0:46:06] brewtank: arcane
[0:46:09] xxxmagnifico: rdruid took heavy nerfs already with the bear form change
[0:46:10] fatulina: evo
[0:46:12] Zenlyn: coming from priest pov, im spending 6+ globals to get a lifebloom. In the past if i purged a lifebloom it'd heal for a considerable amount, maybe buff bloom healing when purged (cos of budding leaves talent it'd be too broken to buff bloom healing directly)
[0:46:15] Abruaz: bring back klepto ;)
[0:46:17] ALjalladTv: treants not being on global can counteract the spam purge rushdown
[0:46:20] brewtank: hunter + sham can have a decent bit of purge together
[0:46:25] Abruaz: the 1 tap all hots
[0:47:10] Zenlyn: Maybe u notice it on shaman too though, facing arcane+rdruid they have 9 rows of buffs now
[0:47:18] itz_killjoy: remove the treants and call it a day
[0:47:57] tonyferalmovies: yoo
[0:48:03] tonyferalmovies: are u playing 3s only with team?
[0:48:12] tonyferalmovies: or u up for some session with other one
[0:48:13] nameyourform: 52k for ele
[0:48:15] twinkieruler95: treants are to op
[0:48:33] tonyferalmovies: np
[0:48:52] tonyferalmovies: do u think evo is good? in this meta
[0:49:16] Immortal1266: i wish you could queue up all your alts at once and just swap when it pops lol
[0:49:22] emmywiink: Affliction lock?
[0:49:24] tonyferalmovies: do u face good ele outlaw good rdruid arcane outlaw?
[0:49:30] Zenlyn: spellsteal is part of their damage rotation tho, thats the issue with arcane
[0:49:49] corla1: what do you think of resto druid?
[0:50:03] nikthevoker: is purge still roation on ele/SP too?
[0:50:03] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:50:03] Zenlyn: they fish for clearcasting via spellstealing
[0:50:28] marsyo: !FOLLOWAGE
[0:50:29] Moobot: @marsyo marsyo's been asking Cdew to use hex for 10y 9mo OSFrog
[0:50:42] shredder1111: they would be garbage since they would then have to hard cast to do any good dmg
[0:50:50] tonyferalmovies: agree
[0:50:50] Secretwombatbro: didnt ignore pain get removed from giving overpower procs, spellsteal for clearcasting is kinda the same yeah?
[0:50:56] shredder1111: needs a rework because yea the spellsteal spam is obnoxious
[0:50:58] itz_killjoy: here comes the 200k dps unkickable unccable unslowable dev evoker LUL
[0:50:59] tonyferalmovies: rdruid needed got nerf treant
[0:51:12] tonyferalmovies: or at list make treant like a psyfind
[0:51:19] tonyferalmovies: 2 globals = dead
[0:51:31] Gwynbleidd710: Is Arcane even the problem with mage specs? Isn't Frost more OP rn? I might be wrong
[0:51:39] tonyferalmovies: and only target it, not random aoe
[0:51:45] tonyferalmovies: like a totems
[0:52:14] skepperr: tonyferal in the building

[0:52:57] shredder1111: one way they could buff mages and nerf spellsteal would be increasing mana costs of other stuff so more chance to get clearcast procs
[0:53:13] tonyferalmovies: aswear if im balance pvp i will make only sure its agree about highest pvp community then make changes
[0:53:36] Zenlyn: no tony u cant listen to the highest pvpers

[0:59:23] tonyferalmovies: @Smexxin agree, but at the same time, tournaments for highest lvl pvp players, soo idk
[1:00:23] shredder1111: the tournaments exist for the viewers and to retain interest/subs in the overall game, they dont care about catering for the top 1%
[1:00:44] FoxiekittenWoW: its not even 1%
[1:00:44] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[1:00:55] shredder1111: yea
[1:00:59] brewtank: kidna Pog
[1:01:02] brewtank: kinda* Pog
[1:01:23] Ey_an: it should break roots though so u can use it
[1:01:29] Ey_an: so buggy
[1:01:29] Solastro: kinda nuts they added a talent choice node for monks and wont do it for voker
[1:01:30] Zenlyn: IF CDEW BALANCED THE GAME MD WOULDNT BE 2 MIN CD
[1:01:31] Zenlyn: PREACH
[1:01:47] zaetar: They should make verdant embrace like skyreach where it has 2 modes - dash and no dash
[1:01:56] cutexlol_: @Zenlyn ofc it wouldnt be a 2min cd when its not even in the game anymore KEKW
[1:03:06] tonyferalmovies: @Zenlyn how holy feels rn? still bad ?

[1:04:42] shredder1111: lmao rekt
[1:04:53] pharmztko: Sadge
[1:04:56] Lazeeqt: imo after the changes disc is worst
[1:05:03] Zenlyn: i disagree but im biased :')
[1:05:05] gregl__: low key might be caster mw
[1:05:06] tonyferalmovies: i mean u cannot play holy when ur serenety heal like riptade 200k
[1:05:14] creed8: lol
[1:05:20] itz_killjoy: all i see is holy priests now, and its so annoying watching my health ping pong up and down between death and full hp
[1:05:22] DentalDayum: DentalDayum subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! yo dew 🫡
[1:05:26] vibesham: @Zenlyn What do you think is the worst healer?
[1:05:28] tonyferalmovies: they needed buff it at list x2 like its in last season
[1:05:40] rekt1370: hows feral tony you having a good time
[1:05:40] Zenlyn: If hpriest doesnt do absurd healing it'll automatically be the worst healer cos it has no damage reduction etc
[1:05:45] tonyferalmovies: so at list on tourny gonna be more healers
[1:05:45] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[1:06:12] tonyferalmovies: @sno8831 yep
[1:06:24] Zenlyn: @corazin why are there 2400 tanks, same question bro
[1:06:26] FoxiekittenWoW: @corazin they prob play fistweaver
[1:06:31] tonyferalmovies: but we playing at 2.5 in Main comps, that was real meta, feral so squishy
[1:06:33] tonyferalmovies: xD
[1:07:02] LifeOfDanDotMe: @foxiekittenwow that is still a mistweaver though?
[1:07:20] Gwynbleidd710: @corazin you gotta check 3v3 ladder, not solo. 3v3 ladder mistweaver ranks second to last, only better than holy priest. In coordinated pvp, MW is ass

[2:21:53] ashdor: LOL
[2:22:25] Disparage: @hamsti would more than likely see something useless instead of giving rogue divine shield on a 2 minute cd with cdr
[2:22:35] Disparage: useful*
[2:23:00] hamsti: KEKW
[2:23:17] magixss: rogues needed bubble tho, was struggling before that
[2:23:53] hamsti: IMO rogues need auto bubble like rets used to have
[2:23:55] Laythos: games on the coil was unlucky
[2:24:20] Laythos: it just didnt heal u is what i mean
[2:24:37] Disparage: honestly rogue is really struggling should add 10 seconds more to the cdr and maybe and extra vanish, and heck while we are at it lets give mage an extra school so casting is easier.

[3:03:15] tonyferalmovies: @el_pan7 this guy so smart its true, feral so squishy on wotlk but he dont die in 1 global, because he have dmg reduction in cat in stans

[3:04:00] Breadmanfun: @tonyferalmovies it’s an honor /bow
[3:04:18] Old_Tomatoes: Cause the bot doesnt need to target you
[3:04:22] hamsti: he targets his mage for the first like 1/4 of the rotation too
[3:04:22] Roo1993: not targeting could just be ui not loading in time
[3:04:23] Old_Tomatoes: it just sends commands
[3:04:24] Solastro: the names bad and perfect
[3:04:27] Solastro: seems like a bot combo

[3:05:57] dooshken: focus rotation lol
[3:05:59] Cybernytez: OMEGALUL
[3:06:01] Old_Tomatoes: Technically theres a new targeting thing in retail that abilties will resolve to nearest valid target if your target isnt
[3:06:04] Vanaxx: KEKW
[3:06:11] ImFromTheFuture: KEKW
[3:06:11] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:06:18] EFFSIN: botting in the 2's
[3:06:20] Old_Tomatoes: But I think its only damage
[3:06:26] Vanaxx: he has a youtube video
[3:06:28] Vanaxx: about it
[3:06:43] boltqt_: That disarm was weird fast
[3:07:08] tonyferalmovies: wierd is he have name perfect and played perfect AHAHAHA
[3:07:15] tonyferalmovies: with 2k exp
[3:07:34] EFFSIN: he trinket as .5 cheap
[3:07:34] forshard: trinket and vanish
[3:07:35] boltqt_: He trinket vanishes
[3:07:38] Rafikki: trinket evasion too

[3:08:04] stOgey: yea this is something KEKW
[3:08:27] boltqt_: His opener disarm is insanely bad 2
[3:08:29] tonyferalmovies: @cdewx do u see venruki video? when he show it replays how bots play on wotlk? same think btw perfect trinket, step stans, dmg rotation i think is the same like on wotlk just come on retail same scripts
[3:08:35] omnomnomnomnomn: omnomnomnomnomn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[3:08:43] cutexlol_: @cdewx he also said on his yt video that the diceroll doesnt even makes sense because you can keep it up with rush in stealth so it wouldnt make sense to roll dice at opener
[3:09:28] fatjoey: oh shit u got the lock out?
[3:09:29] bignoooodle: tell trill to try the disarm strat

[3:09:42] hamsti: i don't even care about any of the other stuff. I just thought it was hilarious he did like 6 abilities without targeting pika
[3:09:48] hamsti: then swapped target finally
[3:09:49] hamsti: KEKW
[3:10:01] shredder1111: i feel like this guy just used the bot vs pika to get feedback to improve it later on LUL
[3:10:02] crucybletv: the whazz vs jamie clip was super sus

[3:11:46] zachgamegodx: tbh if someone were to make a bot just to snipe pikaboo and beat him rogue v rogue in front of his stream as he’s smurfing 1600 I’d maybe call that justice
[3:11:51] Lazeeqt: see? Jaime
[3:12:08] WiggliTV: what is that a clip of?
[3:12:18] tonyferalmovies: only 1 think i can say from my opinion, jaime 100% use it some  for never miss kicks
[3:12:19] galadice: potential botting
[3:12:34] Cybernytez: seems sus xd
[3:12:36] Old_Tomatoes: Your damage abilities can autotarget people if you have the setting toggled on in combat
[3:12:40] EFFSIN: that doesnt look sus
[3:12:44] FoxiekittenWoW: raiku said in lontar chat yesterday that if jaime is not cheating which they all thinks he is, he is the best player wow have ever seen
[3:12:44] EFFSIN: or is it
[3:12:52] bignoooodle: u gotta be an iditot to bot at that rating
[3:12:56] jporter_: hasnt jamie been the best ele in EU for a long long time
[3:12:59] joshywoshhyy: that's a part of the skill expression in gameplay, no?
[3:12:59] Cybernytez: ye but what it was almost insta
[3:13:00] galadice: jaime might be that good
[3:13:00] shredder1111: that one aint too bad
[3:13:05] zachgamegodx: have you faced him in the past
[3:13:07] tonyferalmovies: @cdewx nooo bro, he was miss kicks alot before , alot and randomly season 2 DF he start never miss it?
[3:13:09] shredder1111: he's in cat form for a bit so was obvious
[3:13:10] hipsterdufus: that didn't look too bad, could just get a lucky knock too
[3:13:14] shredder1111: but he does it every day
[3:13:22] tonyferalmovies: everyone miss kicks, everyone, no metter what rating you are
[3:13:29] EFFSIN: is this after he went 2 blizzcon with whaazz
[3:13:34] Crushpixelz: @zachgamegodx <3
[3:13:41] tonyferalmovies: but when u was not real to fake, man its real
[3:13:41] wubsyo: He plays against the same peeople years all the time. prolly just instinct.
[3:13:45] boltqt_: I doubt that a multi r1 3600+ tournament competitor would toggle a bot to hit 100% of 100% kicks alongside 100% of knocks.
[3:13:47] boltqt_: That seems insane to me.
[3:13:48] bignoooodle: nah he would get caught insta
[3:13:48] tonyferalmovies: but maybe he so smart and best player in the world?
[3:13:51] tonyferalmovies: who know it
[3:14:01] tonyferalmovies: but im talking about his kicks not first time, i have replays
[3:14:47] Cdenzy: link them tony
[3:14:50] reallydruid: wouldn’t jaime of turned it off by now though
[3:14:56] jporter_: dudeee highmountain tauren sham is goated
[3:14:57] reallydruid: if he’s under heat
[3:15:01] cutexlol_: I deathed like 95% of all traps on my priest when i played him in mop
[3:15:05] Nickystr1x: i think i've actually heard you talking about this, hyper focusing on getting goated at specific things to hone that specific skill
[3:15:07] reallydruid: you wouldn’t just keep running the bot lmao
[3:15:09] tonyferalmovies: @Cdenzy its private from season 2 on tournament realm games
[3:15:10] fullsendingsince96: when fury was best i always disarmed the rec as mw them braindead warriors hate that
[3:15:10] W00dyyx: you were focusing on doing it on druid with dk grips
[3:15:15] tonyferalmovies: on my pc
[3:15:18] Swishinn: @reallydruid if hes under heat and suddenly becomes a much worse, lower rated player, isnt that even more obvious?
[3:15:20] Lazeeqt: tonyfe2Drag tonyfe2Khm tonyfe2Love3 tonyfe2Ohhh tonyfe2Meow tonyfe2Yoyo
[3:15:21] Cdenzy: ohh
[3:15:22] shredder1111: but he's doing top dps at the same time while kicking everything to the extent people just eat the kicks and dont even fake
[3:15:25] EFFSIN: i want u 2 static every grapple tonight
[3:15:30] tonyferalmovies: @Lazeeqt tonyfe2Love3 tonyfe2Love3 tonyfe2Love3
[3:15:39] felgazer: Take a shot boyzzzz
[3:15:42] jfachal: jfachal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[3:15:46] boltqt_: Why would Jaime toggle a bot to hit 100% of kicks, he would know its too obvious.
[3:15:52] nameyourform: yeah
[3:16:08] chinchin23: why bring it up now though he would have been doing it for ages bringing it to light now?
[3:16:20] IamWalnuts: true
[3:16:20] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:16:24] tonyferalmovies: 2 options he full smart / he full troll
[3:16:30] cutexlol_: maybe he doesnt run a kick/knock bot but he has a dps bot so he can kick/knock with 100% Focus KEKW
[3:16:36] nameyourform: some of them are sus tho lol
[3:16:38] jfachal: I just got here what’s going on ?
[3:16:39] dooshken: idk I feel like I'd be scared of getting banned due to big streamer influence
[3:16:41] nameyourform: but Jamie is gosted
[3:16:44] nameyourform: goated
[3:16:46] reallydruid: cute lol that’s actually a great point
[3:16:54] Lazeeqt: i bet that Jaime is the dev of the ele bots you've all been seeing haha
[3:16:57] wubsyo: Just playing same players you know what they like to do. Is wild but prolly that
[3:17:12] zachgamegodx: has whazz see how fast mes does Amz on infernal  tho
[3:17:13] claudiogodx: hey boss
[3:17:15] chinchin23: i think there is lots of people that cheat that we dont know of because they dont stream it i full heartly think alot of tourney players do it in general
[3:17:19] claudiogodx: join solo 2600+
[3:17:25] tonyferalmovies: @cdewx but for real, not only 1 player think about he is botting and highest players not say that for fun
[3:17:26] claudiogodx: 50 minute wtf need healers
[3:17:32] Owlcopwn: he's also palying ele sham, which has A LOT of bots kEkW
[3:17:37] EFFSIN: u missed it
[3:17:39] jporter_: does he knock literally every grapple?
[3:17:45] FoxiekittenWoW: yea ALOT of people is saying it
[3:17:46] Vurtxd: 2nd one is sus
[3:17:46] shredder1111: if u bot every day u kinda have to keep it up since it will be obvious if u turn it off and suddenly you arent kicking 90% of things
[3:17:48] tonyferalmovies: everyone type to me make new meme about that as well
[3:17:48] creed8: sus
[3:17:54] Vurtxd: just did
[3:18:01] nameyourform: happened again
[3:18:06] bignoooodle: ppl love to think good players are botting
[3:18:11] ericpowerful: think it was whazz defending jaime too at one point
[3:18:13] EFFSIN: @cdewx i want u 2 focus and static every grapple tn
[3:18:15] fullsendingsince96: people have been kick botting for years huntards are normally the main ones
[3:18:26] hamsti: I need the outlaw bot and an ele bot to team up.. undefeated Kappa
[3:18:43] Cybernytez: 1 thing is fo sho, Blizzard needs to have an eye on Jaime Keepo
[3:18:50] tonyferalmovies: if u watch jaime games on clash live tournament he do miss kicks
[3:19:00] tommymage: 2nd one is fine
[3:19:04] tommymage: imho
[3:19:08] tonyferalmovies: if im show you my replays offline, neve miss kick
[3:19:33] EFFSIN: i never miss kick
[3:19:37] EFFSIN: i never press it tho
[3:19:37] Swishinn: Kappa
[3:19:39] nameyourform: didn’t he finish with a 99% kick rate
[3:19:39] Nickystr1x: maybe performance anxiety
[3:19:41] nameyourform: in an AWC
[3:19:45] ShaHugs: I’d be surprised if he was botting without getting banned
[3:19:49] cutexlol_: I never hit kick GIGACHAD
[3:19:50] Ceribi: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/FlirtyFairDurianWow-DYkd4j_0NkAVTF7y what about this one
[3:19:53] Ceribi: he does a 180
[3:19:56] Ceribi: insta knock
[3:19:57] Itankarenas: @tonyferalmovies kick this ( ° ͜ʖ͡°)╭∩╮
[3:20:02] chinchin23: yeah i mean its pretty clear tbh dont miss kicks knock every grapple or step like its 100 percent cheat
[3:20:20] EFFSIN: the crazy thing about this one is the shit quality
[3:20:30] tonyferalmovies: @ShaHugs blizzard never ban for it people u cannot check it for real
[3:20:33] boltqt_: @cdewx Nah watch Jaime spin 180 in that
[3:20:36] tonyferalmovies: its not scripts
[3:20:36] fatulina: well he played this past Kappablizzcon and he won ,just ask to his enemys if he missed a kick there
[3:20:37] Itankarenas: that is a crazy knock
[3:20:39] boltqt_: The spin is a lil crazy
[3:20:40] tonyferalmovies: its AHK + WA
[3:20:43] ShaHugs: if he’s cat form running at healer you can just wait for leap
[3:20:44] boltqt_: a full 180 knock is insane
[3:20:48] Ceribi: jaime spin 180 insta knock is insane
[3:20:50] boltqt_: thats bot level
[3:20:52] ghostgalx: maybe hes just gamergodx Kappa
[3:20:55] zachgamegodx: ele does have room to pay more attention to other things like dew says
[3:20:57] Itankarenas: slow mo it
[3:21:01] Carcer69: whaazz also called him out
[3:21:02] tonyferalmovies: blizzard cannot check it, so its not real to get catch for it
[3:21:04] boltqt_: Yeah thats uh
[3:21:04] Cybernytez: lmao
[3:21:07] boltqt_: Thats sketchy
[3:21:09] zachgamegodx: it’s not a 180 ?
[3:21:10] Carcer69: a couple of streams ago
[3:21:13] chinchin23: haha
[3:21:13] Swishinn: jaime botting confirmed
[3:21:13] zachgamegodx: it’s a 90
[3:21:13] joshywoshhyy: i mean he's either the GOAT or that's sus
[3:21:14] dropbombsss: big cheating
[3:21:14] vodin__: does it insta
[3:21:15] Swishinn: check him pc

[3:21:28] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[3:21:34] tonyferalmovies: @cdewx auto hot key + weak aura = make miracle for players
[3:21:40] bignoooodle: thats just a weird script to have...why would u want to bot knock leaps?
[3:21:42] joshywoshhyy: yeah true
[3:21:52] gracioussatan: sometimes low value plays like that are what outs botting
[3:21:56] tonyferalmovies: auto hot key should be banned if players abuse this way
[3:21:58] tommymage: in fairness if you see it from mage pov that i have . his healer is in blind and chas is bashing jaime to cover
[3:22:07] chinchin23: i mean your a good shaman and there is no way you have those reactions
[3:22:09] tommymage: to be fair
[3:22:14] ShaHugs: did they not ban AHK?
[3:22:19] humrai: if it turns out that jaime is not cheating it has got to be a huge ego boost that everyone thinks he is
[3:22:20] EFFSIN: static this guys grapple hook
[3:22:21] xenkr: @cdewx hey cdew. when does seeding happen for AWC?
[3:22:22] Itankarenas: I thought AHK was banned?
[3:22:24] chinchin23: all the time?
[3:22:31] Lazeeqt: @Itankarenas nop
[3:22:34] jesma: hes always been good and high rated so how does he suddenly get soooo good he knocks everything and never misses kicks anymore
[3:22:36] tonyferalmovies: bro auto hot key its not just spam program
[3:22:37] Itankarenas: oh damn
[3:22:39] nameyourform: your keybinds are showing
[3:22:46] tonyferalmovies: its auto spam u not needed pressed btw
[3:22:56] tonyferalmovies: so that why its needed be banned somehow idk
[3:22:59] Cybernytez: nah man im convinced now hes a botter
[3:23:13] chinchin23: im sure there is heaps of people cheating with it as well we dont know off
[3:23:50] Itankarenas: tfw they purge your earth shield gachiGASM

[3:24:03] hamsti: watching affliction wls is so awesome
[3:24:05] Zevx: the wotlk players using AHK are legit cheaters @tonyferalmovies
[3:24:09] vodin__: I mean with the amount of high level people talking about it there has to be some merit to the dude potentially cheating
[3:24:33] tonyferalmovies: @Zevx nahhh its not cheats, problem with ahk other players use this for automize some addons or WA
[3:24:33] chinchin23: @Zevx hey agian you mean every warrior haha
[3:24:33] hamsti: do alot of people cheat in wotlk?
[3:24:38] tonyferalmovies: that a main problem

[5:59:36] stonecheeks94: you'd do better if you were a white human male brother KKona
[5:59:51] RealXrave: LUL @ stonecheeks94
[5:59:59] mrcreatine123: i almost got 1v2'd by a fistweaver, it just feels like they take zero damage
[6:00:01] stonecheeks94: LULW
[6:00:07] zachgamegodx: ret dh fist weave is just engineered to win every cleave, they lose to plenty tho
[6:00:18] NPBeharry: humans should be able to be shamans at this point in the game tho no cap
[6:00:25] RealXrave: the kwok

[6:03:02] chrisiirc: "i see that youre in trouble here"
[6:03:08] gracioussatan: @xnoxious94 guessing it's the ret buffs?
[6:03:20] Lathrien: dk armor nerfs
[6:03:20] mrcreatine123: that ret was aggressive as hell and no punishment for it
[6:03:31] chrisiirc: hell yeah
[6:03:35] Wasbeernico: Wasbeernico subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[6:03:39] xnoxious94: well... the armor nerf to platey's is rough specifically because of the hunter pets
[6:03:44] Gwynbleidd710: @gracioussatan It's Vanguards tho

[6:04:30] xnoxious94: cupid is just a good comp cause it has a lot of cc also
[6:04:41] gracioussatan: @Gwynbleidd710 fucker kills every healing stream and tide too
[6:04:42] xnoxious94: and bm hunter and retribution paladin are just good rn
[6:04:43] gracioussatan: xD
[6:04:46] nickc2122: yeah blizzard sure does that's for sure lol
[6:04:50] nickc2122: and rogues

[6:05:44] xnoxious94: bm hunter cupid is just good
[6:05:53] Gwynbleidd710: @gracioussatan Yea he's top tier. I think Ret is not op at all even after buffs, Vanguards just makes it look good even when it's absolute dogwater

[6:07:57] Tuandoann: no dark
[6:08:17] xqzlol1: ret dh
[6:08:25] whitewallss: check cc received, gotta be insane
[6:08:30] Pallehz: i swear if ret had half the cc Rogues do, they'd be nerfed in a day or two lol
[6:08:31] iLLwiLL_HS: these dk nerfs have seem to have deleted them
[6:08:35] DrWarz: predictions for AWC??
[6:08:42] DrWarz: obv rogue team
[6:08:44] zachgamegodx: cdew when you dream project can you add anything to the action bar  and it’ll stick around next project?
[6:08:48] MaybeRespect: Yeah i dont face Dks for shit anymore. Unironically
[6:08:50] Zartirian: Log destro, mes heal

[6:09:00] CarrotyTucker: always has been rmd
[6:09:01] zachgamegodx: bc maybe if you add time stop to the replacement bar
[6:09:05] buffnac: feel like ele dh might be kinda nuttyy
[6:09:09] zachgamegodx: you can reliably do the tech
[6:09:10] Neji513: gee i've never seen that meta before
[6:09:11] Thell: Some things never change
[6:09:15] xoummaa: what is the easiest dps ?
[6:09:29] nemeuxs: @cdewx just send the RMD
[6:09:35] nehpets808: Call me stupid but I think you go Rdruid every game if ur playing Rsham
[6:09:37] GTruther: @xoummaa BM or DH prob
[6:09:41] morphz____: Yo wassup Dew, you okay? You have a super exhausted vibe. Hope you chilling bro
[6:09:42] CarrotyTucker: this is my first time seeing this class, is it healer only?
[6:09:46] nehpets808: Pressure the druid
[6:09:53] nemeuxs: im coping we play rmd hehehe
[6:09:57] nehpets808: Not allowing him to free cc
[6:10:01] Gwynbleidd710: It does feel like all your comps were targeted lmao. RShaman Armor, Boomie armor, melee cleaves are aids, DK nerf. Very rough, especially just before the awc
[6:10:04] RealXrave: is spam sleep talent good in something like this
[6:10:13] zachgamegodx: like when you dream proj your bar gets overridden by another bar, but it’s empty, can you add abilities to that bar?
[6:10:18] drone14k: what made melee cleaves bad?
[6:10:21] Zartirian: Where the Aug evokers at?
[6:10:36] kaoreal: Could SP rogue pres be good into arcane rogue rdru?
[6:10:48] MaybeRespect: @drone14k Just can't punish anything.
[6:10:49] gracioussatan: I've been waiting for Mesdew
[6:11:03] drone14k: @MaybeRespect is this jsut because of the armor changes?
[6:11:06] TailstabTV: i love pres :)
[6:11:07] zachgamegodx: is it possible that someone kicked your dream proj before you could press time stop
[6:11:09] NPBeharry: finally
[6:11:09] drone14k: didnt think the armor changes were that huge
[6:11:10] iiSmithy: im new to pvp and im not use to having loads of keybinds. what are the most important ones that i should be trying to add first?
[6:11:12] zachgamegodx: just a fast kick?
[6:11:20] RealXrave: mesdew fucks
[6:11:21] MaybeRespect: @drone14k And hp changes for locks are huge.

[6:12:28] jasonkbkt: @iismithy basic rotational abilities
[6:12:59] Zartirian: 1 week out from tourney? Perfect time to shake the meta
[6:13:28] iiSmithy: @jasonkbkt yeah i have those, i just know alot of high end arena players have like, arena123, focus123, interupt 123 etc and i dont know which are the most important
[6:14:01] jasonkbkt: Start is focus kick 1st
[6:14:01] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[6:14:17] jasonkbkt: Not sure what class u play

[6:14:32] MaybeRespect: Warlock, Rogue. Pick one of those
[6:14:36] jasonkbkt: Focus incap
[6:15:00] chrisiirc: thats so rough
[6:15:08] jacob_the_mage: Cdew I heard crusader is gonna play in AWC ... big dam judges and good ol fash heals...
[6:15:12] jasonkbkt: Start with one at a time. That's a perfect ability to start with.
[6:15:15] RealXrave: 1st game 1st game
[6:15:28] Zartirian: He reversed when u call for tremor
[6:15:28] zachgamegodx: @hurleystream that’s cool
[6:15:30] iiSmithy: @jasonkbkt yeah that was my plan, no way i would be able to add them all in one go. would fry my brain
[6:15:44] morphz____: How are you feeling about AWC dude? Wishing you luck homies
[6:15:48] Cocoapuffs1: melee caster with pres seems so bad
[6:15:53] Cocoapuffs1: positionally
[6:16:38] magnesiium1: cant he just glimpse first and then dispel and be fine?
[6:16:51] zachgamegodx: glimpse is 35% dmg reduction
[6:16:51] magnesiium1: LMFAO
[6:16:53] xnoxious94: LUL
[6:16:58] jasonkbkt: @iismithy you might be surprised how far you can go with just a cpl focus abilities
[6:16:58] Tuandoann: OMEGABOWL
[6:16:59] CarrotyTucker: what tf
[6:17:01] Karaelolz: lol
[6:17:03] bubblebuddyx_: tHE CLAssic
[6:17:07] magnesiium1: HOLY DISPEL DMGE
[6:17:09] RealXrave: classic
[6:17:11] chrisiirc: did they hot fix it?
[6:17:13] kreyzy8: it happened again :(
[6:17:21] GTruther: wtf
[6:17:27] Ristvakbaen1911: What was that??
[6:17:34] chrisiirc: it was ua
[6:17:45] RealXrave: hotfixed yesterday maybe? worst poss timing?
[6:17:56] chrisiirc: the devs probs saw the reddit post
[6:17:58] chrisiirc: exposing it
[6:18:04] ChumpSeason: dispel protection should never be that strong. just bad design
[6:18:09] nickc2122: it 100% got fixed.
[6:18:12] ShaHugs: did it happen again?
[6:18:13] kreyzy8: its weird that it worked that 1st round of shuffle yesterday, and then not the 2nd round lol
[6:18:32] jasonkbkt: Dispel protection shouldn't 1 shot u
[6:18:33] morphz____: Wargames?
[6:18:44] siuolater: maybe only works for the UA on you? but not the ones on your team mates
[6:19:13] spacemanwx: u were in global  i think no?
[6:19:13] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[6:19:36] soothingmistmonk: it did look like it was in a global
[6:20:31] Ristvakbaen1911: Ahhh I had to read what they both do. So you attempted to full dispel and immune it? Then because it's UA/Vamp touch, it detonated you rather than immuning you
[6:21:43] PineTreesz: Rofl imagine hot fixing a very clever use of mechanics that takes you specing into 2 pvp talents with 1min cds to pull it off.

[6:22:52] zachgamegodx: you can try it with this macro, apparently it works /cancelaura Dream Projection /cast Time Stop
[6:22:54] soothingmistmonk: Does trill play a caster?
[6:23:04] soothingmistmonk: Or play ele boomy with Sam?

[6:24:17] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[6:24:20] PineTreesz: @zachgamegodx the reason it worked was because the time stop cast would go off before the dream projection dispeled. ur ordering will not pull that off
[6:24:21] mrcreatine123: so bad
[6:24:25] itz_killjoy: dev/fdk
[6:25:13] bordum: hey cdew do u think its harder to fight windwalkers or warriors?
[6:25:21] MaybeRespect: Every1 thought the changes weren't a big deal but man it feels awful facing 2x caster
[6:25:37] ShaHugs: wish they had catch up mechanics for sockets on alts
[6:25:41] Ristvakbaen1911: @itz_killjoy Hoping for a Abom limb/tip + fire breath + deep breath?

[6:27:56] MaybeRespect: Well IMO cleaves are reliant on small kill windows with how mobile casters are. and the changes did not help that
[6:27:58] remofreecss: Do you guys hás a Idea of the others teams como based on the games?
[6:28:06] remofreecss: Conps*
[6:28:20] Thell: So I guess it is back to the good melee being ones I don't want to play
[6:28:22] MaybeRespect: If they want to make casters more passively tanky, maybe rethink mobility spells.
[6:28:28] MaybeRespect: Idk though.
[6:31:31] Winring86: I don’t know why anyone thought that making casters more tanky without any other changes  to their toolkit was a good idea. To this point they were balanced on having less armor. And some of them (like arcane mage) were already immortal. Just completely out of touch IMO

[7:49:08] WardenDOTA: i watched the vod of those warlock games and every time it worked you either had precog or shroud up might just be a coincidence tho
[7:49:33] sharpdressedman15: is the root change even noticable
[7:49:59] kaounallah: precog needs to be shorter tbh
[7:50:01] PineTreesz: 20% haste precog was wild

[7:53:42] zachgamegodx: can’t you guys play prot warr o r some Garbo
[7:53:57] PineTreesz: @rbgsepp pro tip, you are really exaggerating the amounts of boosts and bots you are seeing at 1600. probably less than 10% of your games.
[7:53:59] WardenDOTA: the damage isnt everything its also another nameplate to annoy the shit out of everyone
[7:55:14] bump1: its def better than his 5% dmg/5% haste buff to his pet
[7:55:15] FoxiekittenWoW: @rbgsepp you dont really find many bots, yes boosts happens but it is still not quite frequent and it will never affect your rating in any notiable way. If you want to learn and improve the only way is to spam play and thne you can watch streamers who play yourself and try to do what they do.
[7:55:28] shugguls: wotlk
[7:55:34] van_hendrix: van_hendrix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months! hey this is pretty cool!

[7:56:13] Frostyjoneslol: @rbgsepp there really arent that many boost bud, the pvp community is fairly small. It happens but it aint rampant, if u wanna learn, best u can do is research alot, watch people that play your class/spec. Solo Q and yolo Q make friends and partners
