[1:09:45] CrimsonNurse: Soul Ash and the mount are the only rewards from doing Torghast? What happened to the cosmetic rewards that Blizzard was talking about in your Alpha interview?
[1:09:46] I_DoctorSatan_I: @rayraytheon Which boss? Was it Observer Zelgar?
[1:09:50] naughtillus: @CaptainPhatty Kind of put me off of trying again too

[1:12:42] I_DoctorSatan_I: @rayraytheon yea, i had Observer Zelgar, he just 2 shots my pet with his Soul Blast. No matter if I had a Chelfthoof pet or Tenacity (tank) pet, he would just hit them once for 50%, Mend Pet, by the time the Mend Pet took effect, he casted Soul Blast again and killed my pet. Standing there for 4 sec to revive pet, 41k Soul Blast, 36k melee and i was dead. Floor 18.

[1:41:11] zeviika: at least havoc isnt the op spec this time. they def did not deserve the damage they did in bfa
[1:41:16] buodild: maybe they need another dot that does more dmg based off runic power spent that heals you for a percentage of the dmg with pvp cap on it?
[1:41:19] JamieJuno: i miss deathstrike being rune based
[1:41:36] MrGattz: @NeoJon82 its a WA. just look up cursor or mouse on wago and youll find a ton of them
[1:41:38] Kriven: drinking the fozzy bear
[1:41:45] raspaqq: brewmaster will take over with higher ilvl conduits, most people play dh cause of it being the raid toon and the dmg it does,its still paper tho

[2:45:14] AutumnReds: no chance
[2:45:14] zaraine1: dude calm down
[2:45:16] Roadskii: The fact is that the Twitch community and streamers alike need to help support one another. Help build each other up, especially the ones putting in effort to stream and all. If Twitch isn't careful, they will end up screwed as some new platform for streaming rises. They already lost the add-on side of things and really the only thing they have left is streaming. More needs to be done.

[2:49:26] Roadskii: I agree @Towelliee it sucks to get burned from helping others and then they don't "pay it forward" or return the favor. There should just be consequences for people taking advantage of others. Hell LOL, make an incentive for helping new streamers even...If they start getting big then sign contracts where you get a percentage of the profits lol
[2:49:31] smashwow: @Towelliee i feel you, but doing that got you where you are today. i'd say it's paid off. yes those people that snubbed you can fuck off. nothing but respect for you.

[3:13:36] Fluisterwoud: yo honestly that 2nd channel is so much more laid back
[3:13:36] Renritar: He ended stream on secondary account yesterday bc stream snipers were trolling him in Rust
[3:13:37] Antdavs24: honestly i respect him for that lol
[3:13:40] Masqerader: do look like he's pushing 40

[3:13:42] Raugdel: Tired being "Asmongold", i would say
[3:13:43] Masqerader: *dude
[3:13:45] Teitanblood: His chat was amazing when he was new to Twitch. Slow and mature. Now its fucked up

[3:14:02] MuttonChopins: I like watching him in his alt channel more than his main channel
[3:14:08] knigghtmare: yeah i really like more the asmonrawr stream so chill
[3:14:11] casualboomer: He's made his bed, and he should at least have the integrity to sleep in it.
[3:14:12] scrotobaggin: I much more enjoy his 2nd channel, because that is the real him not the internet personality Asmongold

[3:14:18] StoicTaurus: It's time for Asmon Chat Culling - That entire place has to be PURGED.
[3:14:20] nick1295: He needs to get a fresh mod team and start banning and changing his chat
[3:14:20] Antdavs24: or thats the channel he streams more regularly on and comes on Asmon when he needs to
[3:14:26] oldmandinkleberg: TBH any chat with more than 4000 people typing is just a unreadable mess of KEKW
[3:14:30] speedyweedy22: true
[3:14:31] Vigi9413: I think Asmon is way more intelligent than people give him credit
[3:14:34] DemonicGrizz: @Towelliee That is what he tweeted out yesterday

[3:14:43] vonviktor_: I think his friends convinced him of doing OTK and he doesn't really enjoy being around people that much
[3:14:44] DaltonIRL: Daddy's gotta run to the store and get some cigarettes @Towelliee

[3:14:59] MN_Generic: so trueeee
[3:15:00] northcub: why would the chat be any differnet on his second channel if it is the same viewer base?
[3:15:00] Roobi_doobi: what is OTK?

[3:15:22] thiccsushi: @northcub 50k on main channel vs like the 4-8k on secondary big difference

[3:15:26] TheBeastofCaerBannog: you know how i know your cold, cause were connected!
[3:15:34] Ser_Theobald: @northcub he doesn't do his asmongold persona on the second channel, much more laid back
[3:15:35] Roobi_doobi: @I_DoctorSatan_I thanks
[3:15:54] smashwow: about asmon being tired of his community
[3:15:58] northcub: so hese tired of acting
[3:16:00] Poriand: @Ser_Theobald second channel kinda better ya
[3:16:03] Twigz_KC: I like watching Quin, but I can't fucking stand his chat

[3:16:08] shawty918: the messed up thing is he encourages his chats toxic behavior

[3:16:27] juniorsoprano9: When will we see some prot pally pvp?
[3:16:33] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee you have had a smaller community, but you always look like your having fun and in good spirits for the most part. I rather follow that sort of blue print than asmon
[3:16:40] keeindordel: @roobi_doobi the org is founded by Asmongold, Esfand, Rich Cambell, and many others
[3:16:41] MILESkg21: TRINK or RIOT
[3:16:42] wezz_10: I prefer the zackrawrr channel more than the Asmongold one. And there’s prolly a lot like that.
[3:16:45] duncon: tyrannical, raging, explosive ugh. not a good week.
[3:16:50] smashwow: trinket or belt....
[3:16:53] bookooti: Ya i feel like the same thing is going to happen with quin69 and his community is the most toxic community that i have ever seen. @Towelliee

[3:43:12] cowee12356995: It feels epic when you finally get loot. but I'm a casual
[3:43:20] Vigi9413: you shouldn't go 4 mythic dungeons with nothing droppingg
[3:43:20] N3llee: @Towelliee I like like that fear and upgrades actually are meaningful but I dont like doing +10 key on time and only seeing 2-3 people get loot

[3:43:30] Kromede: jerexify Pepehand
[3:43:32] redtemplar88: Just up the loot by one more and I think it would be good with the vault and not having to time keys.
[3:43:36] Atrosity: mythic plus feels awful. I'd rather just get 1800 pvp and gear that way
[3:43:37] Teredo21: 3 items for 20 mythic is stupid
[3:43:39] kniftty: spamming mythic + to get loot is pretty lame, imo
[3:43:48] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee what'd you get in the vault? I slept in LUL
[3:43:50] yudas7: @Towelliee how would you change mythic+ loot ?
[3:43:52] random_user17623: You should try a game called "Darwin Project", it is a fun game
[3:43:53] healmore49: wtf is wrong the server is all fucked up atm
[3:43:58] merzicdh: my favorite thing in wow is doing content then not getting rewarded for it
[3:43:59] Lyshmo0: m+ loot, getting loot in 1/10 dungeons and it's shit because its 210
[3:44:02] Lyshmo0: nice system
[3:44:03] Scruffy_Robot: It's great when a piece finally drops and it's stats are so bad it's worse than the 158 crafted piece you are already wearing
[3:44:09] MrTahmm: Oribos quests?

[3:44:16] Aro725: dont fly to oribos, fall to westfall inc
[3:44:16] Iggy1221: Blizzard dont play the game, cant expect proper changes 🤔 - Its litterly a joke atm. Also it seems beyond hard for them to "line up" dps and tanks just a bit.. Some are so much ahead its dumb.
[3:44:24] Foxdoabarrelrofl: whats the renown cap this week?
[3:44:29] zaraine1: or the same as heroic

[3:44:47] Thunder4o: nah M+ loot is how it should be now
[3:44:49] Xiten: pvp gear also better than m+ gear right now... that is terrible
[3:44:54] griffdog125: 3 wks of heroic nath clear. 1 loot dtop
[3:45:00] tinkbox: @healmore49 trueeee

[3:45:31] Iggy1221: The explasion is great, but the balance of classes and lootdrop could be made way better by a 10yo
[3:45:34] windycity9: ty!
[3:45:34] Vigi9413: @Towelliee would you rather Indy went after Wentz or Matty Stafford

[3:46:33] JacobBose: Its garbage
[3:46:34] Thoreya: so im good
[3:46:38] banditTA79: Gearing is way to slow

[3:46:44] Vigi9413: are you doing venthyr back rare this morning?
[3:46:46] Hypsipyl3: no do raid 10 bosses 0 drops, m= same
[3:46:47] Durzobluntzzz: ok herad @CozzyFlannel
[3:46:48] Avinar: I don't because I hate arena but always forced to arenas.
[3:46:50] Masqerader: i believe rick james said "cocaine is helluva drug"
[3:46:52] Xerevil: loot system is straight garbage
[3:46:53] neverbornlucky: what it better then raid shadow ledgends
[3:46:53] pavepawns: i like gear this expac but i dont think the way of obtaining it is good
[3:46:55] slipper14: What do you change about M+? It's too easy imo to give it same gear as heroics, would just spam M15's for free heroic gear
[3:46:56] Lyshmo0: @Thunder4o ah you're just a troll, not even a good tho
[3:46:57] porowozek: so all three pvp people in wow are happy finally?
[3:46:58] BraerHZ: M+ being so shit is driving me away from this expansion entirely, when I had serious plans to go hard beforehand

[3:47:16] JacobBose: This game is more grindy then bfa was and loot system still sucks.
[3:47:16] Iggy1221: But we get "increased ilvl of worldquests" LUL
[3:47:18] CozzyFlannel: but why do casuals need more ilvl?
[3:47:23] Rictamar: if you don't raid you are kinda screwed haha
[3:47:23] NILLme: game needs badly a valor vendor
[3:47:25] UNSUNG_HER0: im still saying it
[3:47:25] Skaboy_TV: Not just casuals! Us raiders who get unlucky drops are getting the shaft as well.
[3:47:26] Dodiwoodz: dude i went two weeks without a drop from M+
[3:47:28] Dixietwist: lol
[3:47:28] healmore49: almost want to stop playing because the loot is so lame atm. I feel like pvpers are like 20 ilvls higher than me

[3:47:42] Thoreya: good thing this expansion is 1000x better than draenor
[3:47:42] Dodiwoodz: fucking dog shit.. 8-12's and not a single piece of loot for 14 days..
