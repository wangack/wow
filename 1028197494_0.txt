[2:15:44] iitsmadness: creates drama thats good for him
[2:15:48] Democritus33: @Towelliee asmongold has a record of being an absolute hypocrite, he also said 5 years ago that he wouldnt go for a sub button!
[2:15:50] birdehh87: hes "addicted"
[2:15:50] TheItalianStallion321: hes 30 living an attic that he hasnt cleaned in 10 years.....yeah, he has issues
[2:15:50] Dawneskye: they were legit telling people to log out in lfg chat on faerlina cause he was in que
[2:15:51] froodyo: get that last pelt!
[2:15:56] rhodeos_: lets be honest..the boost is really good for the game. its not good for the quality of players but its a 13 year old game sooo *shrug*
[2:15:56] JeemTeam: drama for the views/clicks
[2:16:01] idenkaz_: i think he doesnt know what he actually wants and goes with the trend and does the other thing. hope he gets this sorted out, its sad to watch.
[2:16:06] Broomba: spit on those who buy the mount
[2:16:08] Eriewst: Controversy breeds views. Scummy but it works
[2:16:08] Panda_Locomotive: he is purely a meme react lord
[2:16:12] VideoRunner: love the chill stream @Towelliee
[2:16:18] Arizonaer: Never listen to that fool
[2:16:19] Rickity_Racked: Yea
[2:16:24] kemist7: what sthe addon for xp on top?
[2:16:25] dracullus: @Towelliee this long tweet is not even coherent when you analize it, just 'make better game' with lot of words to increase drama
[2:16:29] tfarm692: I dont see how he can even remotely read what his chat says
[2:16:34] MrWeedoz: I think asmond doesn't really care about wow
[2:16:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:16:38] Aravarth: I mean, I can kind of understand it to an extent. It's like, people who call for an increase in tax rates but won't "donate" their increased tax monies to the government. Why would they voluntarily donate more of their income to the IRS when it's not systems-wide? it's not hypocritical in that regard IMO.
[2:16:43] Aaradin: He knows what he's doing, those videos just make money.
[2:16:58] puppythrower: @Towelliee  Do you know if Curse of Weakness is bugged on Sire Denathrius Mythic?
[2:17:14] neverbornlucky: Towelliee questing in that area is bad right now
[2:17:15] Democritus33: @Towelliee what do u expect from a guy who said he wouldnt want a sub button on twitch?!
[2:17:20] Broomba: @tfarm692 he doesnt he read what he wants to read to stroke his ego
[2:17:22] Finarato: I cant imagine having 40k people do whatever i say
[2:17:28] hamwise_: "yEAH THIS SUCKS"  haha that got me
[2:17:28] KnowThyName_: anybody know a good server to play on for a new player horde or alliance
[2:17:34] Feldemort_vn: I don’t know what to boost yet
[2:17:37] tfarm692: Exactly i have to turn off chat if i run his stream ever
[2:17:37] KnowThyName_: for classic
[2:17:57] lucidmood: You get any sleep I passed out at like 430am Mountain time and you were still going
[2:18:18] Rickity_Racked: Though, the 35$ character copies was imo the worst thing blizz ever tried to pull
[2:18:23] Twilight_Knight_: So what level we learn that sweet sweet bubble?
[2:18:29] BabzyJae: addons not working :(
[2:18:45] Eriewst: How did you get Questie to work?
[2:18:45] PhillyDilly18: @Towelliee Did you have to go to Org to pick up those items from the deluxe edition?
[2:18:49] Dawneskye: the imp in a ball is great :)
[2:18:58] Feldemort_vn: I thought bubble is at a low level?
[2:19:35] Whitemamba236: bzmode just hit 55 on his BE paladin
[2:19:40] Bixster: i mean its just in tbc classic and not retail. i dont think you can use the old codes in classic
[2:19:46] PhillyDilly18: @Towelliee Thank you kindly!
[2:19:57] neverbornlucky: The box quest there is the one that drove me crazy earlier. People were so rude
[2:19:58] gonziav: but if you buy the original you can use it on retail not classic
[2:19:58] SonofHorus82: It's also in Booty Bay.

[5:14:12] Chiphazzord: its the 3 to 7 min que that slows you down
[5:14:19] GalcianBTH: it ends up making it fun when everyone wants to win fast, more agressive games less turtles

[8:37:42] Hazno: @critcobain they corrected it to how it was supposed to be, the huge amount of honor is a bug

[8:38:08] CritcobainTV: @Hazno the amount of honor we were getting is what we were getting for all of classic, sure it's more than they got during TBC original prepatch, but their prepatch was also longer than 2 weeks
[8:38:11] call_me_snagz: Anyone in chat know if the boost Mount is account wide??
[8:38:25] Eraste: @call_me_snagz it should be, yea
[8:38:30] Artivicii: yeah i spam all the way usually
[8:38:55] Hazno: @critcobain still doesn't change the fact that they're simply correcting it to how it was supposed to be
[8:38:56] Eraste: i genuinely enjoy leveling alone so dont mind being out paced
[8:39:06] nikodemuscrowley: what wow addon manager do you use, im sorry if this is asked a million times
[8:39:21] CritcobainTV: @Hazno with the time of the prepatch being reduced by almost 1/3, them dropping the honor that hard just makes it feel worse for everyone
[8:39:26] Stiffy84: @Towelliee is there anyone on who can do g invites?
[8:39:27] hammack52: considering people are going to go dunguns first to get honored first than quest, the zones may not be as full as they could be
[8:39:29] Farenheight451: @Drussin12 he uses wowup
[8:39:32] Eraste: @Drussin12 he's using WoWup atm for tbc stuff
[8:39:32] Hazno: @drussin12 WowUp
[8:39:37] shavinglove: @Towelliee You see Kluber had a no no today?
[8:39:38] CritcobainTV: Other things aren't the same as original release, sometimes you gotta change things up @Hazno
[8:39:46] Eraste: naxx gdkp runs KEKW

[8:40:14] Hazno: @critcobain sure, but it's still a correction for s bug

[8:41:23] Eraste: i dont think they could merge them
[8:41:30] bruhSit_farmer: asmon bought a boost kekw
[8:41:32] EKS90_: i dont think they will merge em.
[8:41:39] CritcobainTV: @Hazno meh. I still think its more of a nerf than a correction
[8:41:44] Gambit2012: are there going to be new servers for tbc or is it that new servers are being kept to retain classic characters?
[8:41:52] SilkeySmooth: they did already saud they would merg them later
[8:41:53] Eraste: i imagine it'll be 1 classic server per region, and when wrath comes, rinse and repeat with tbc
[8:42:01] VGDocs: that'd be nice tbh
[8:42:05] GalcianBTH: likely use same model going forward
[8:42:05] EmerathEndilix: You say that like people will actually install Classic Towelliee.
[8:42:09] EKS90_: @hjo1992 he said " i will ofc buy it since its there but i dont like that its there " the hypocrasy is strong in this one
[8:42:20] Mitchendo64: its back to retail for me after TBCC
[8:42:28] lifeswings: after that they will start "classic seasons"
[8:42:33] call_me_snagz: @towelliee you think they will go past Wrath? Or will they stay there?
[8:42:35] bruhSit_farmer: yea lol @Commander_Eggi talk about back peddling
[8:42:36] SirOkopogo: classic cata
[8:42:37] Aravarth: I mean, "Classic Seasons" is a great idea
[8:42:39] Malexand6742: Im boosting a mage for BC
[8:42:41] Malexand6742: ooooh ya
[8:42:47] Aravarth: they won't go past WotLK for classic
[8:43:09] SilkeySmooth: they should have done fresh
[8:43:10] Lemonsqze: POGGERS Fresh
[8:43:15] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee I think blizz will eventually start doing fresh servers tbh
[8:43:16] Hazno: @critcobain they literally corrected it to the amount it was supposed to be, so it's a bugfix more than anything.. could they have compensated for it? sure, but that compensation would've been a buff if they went ahead with that
[8:43:16] Supers18: fresh would be Pog
[8:43:24] lifeswings: They will do "classic seasons" for each expansion
[8:43:28] EmerathEndilix: If they just had progression resets that would be great.
[8:43:29] EKS90_: @hjo1992 yeah, I myself dont mind it at all, but if you are going to complain about it that much, then dont use it LUL
[8:43:30] CritcobainTV: @Hazno agree to disagree :)
[8:43:32] Aravarth: ^ IMO that would be the best way to do it
[8:43:33] Feldemort_vn: One that does phases over and over
[8:43:39] skyefoxdeejay: @Towelliee Current Classic servers may go into the Classic+ phases

[8:43:57] GalcianBTH: its probably more of a lets make this for when we want to try it kind of thing for alot of people
[8:44:14] GalcianBTH: a game to put on the shelf for later
[8:44:15] Eraste: fresh would be cool. cant imagine staying in classic otherwise
[8:44:20] sujioox: classic sucked
[8:44:41] Masqerader: I mean a lot of of those 40 man groups would have got cut to 25 if they moved on, so unless they made multiple raid teams going forward too it would be weird
[8:44:47] Hazno: @sujioox good thing you didn't have to play it then LUL
[8:44:48] Arkitek: well thats abit harsh i liked classic lol
[8:45:07] EmerathEndilix: I mean, it should be like EQ2 where every year or 6 mo they just make a new progression server and rerelease each patch and expansion on a timer.
[8:45:19] skyefoxdeejay: @Towelliee They may introduce Classic+ on the current classic era servers, meaning mythic style dungeon systems and newer raids to fit the lore of that world.

[8:46:22] call_me_snagz: What server is towliee on and will this be his main?
[8:46:27] EmerathEndilix: As far as I've seen PandaTV, really well. People still sub just to roll on the progression servers each reset.
[8:46:34] Harper_Tempest: I didn’t see it on my list?
[8:46:43] IchabodCrain: haven't been here in a while. I'm digging that shelf area in the background
[8:46:54] PandaTV: yeah but the game is dead as dead can be say what you want about wow but its lasted the test of time
[8:47:03] sujioox: what is the guild APES doing
[8:47:10] Hazno: I would love to have more client-side visual options, such as enabling modern textures, models, animations and spell effects in classic, purely visual client-side
[8:47:18] longdong581: Sub sunday LOL forgot about that havent watched your stream in a long time
[8:47:19] Somakutala: EQ is a rough start
[8:47:30] Arkitek: that sounds about right
[8:47:47] EKS90_: I played SW galaxy as a 12 year old before wow came out, I accomplished literally nothing LUL
[8:47:52] EmerathEndilix: What I'm saying PandaTV, is that if people are doing it for EQ2 to this day, they'll definitely do it for WoW.

[8:49:05] Einzbern: ragnarok PogChamp
[8:49:05] Noshpan: My first mmo was EverQuest
[8:49:08] EmrakulTheBotcher: @Towelliee Sony had some official maps of the Zones. This was before they added them into the game
[8:49:17] jswatte: I played City of Heroes a ton before WoW
[8:49:18] Lihony: started on FFXI then  wow, and switched back and forth for years
[8:49:20] Mazikeen69666: ultima online

[8:49:48] Crazdmadman: eq...where you needed two computer to play it...one for the game, another for the maps
[8:50:01] worksondev: well you have to remember that WoW was created by people trying to solve the issues of old games :)
[8:50:09] PandaTV: thats what it did it changed mmorpgs forever hate it or love it. you logged on and went HOLY DEMON what is this
[8:50:26] Somakutala: @Towelliee the games were amazing if you never experienced something better.  People like them now due to nostalgia
[8:50:29] Farenheight451: QOL in wow is really what its about old MMOs are hard to get into because the QOL just isnt there @Towelliee
[8:50:34] mimsx: WoW brought MMOs to all the casuals.  FFXI was fun for the time but wow just flat out changed the whole landscape
[8:50:36] Aravarth: One of the really good things that WoW did is that the devs made it so the game would run on a potato; they made it somewhat cartoony (thus fun); good quests, story-driven, and customisable through addons
[8:50:41] Lihony: "what when you die you just get to your corpse ?  What do you mean you don't lose  xp or lvl ? ! "
[8:50:44] PandaTV: vanilla was seen as a care bare mmo the level grind was NOTHING for most hardcore mmo players at the time
[8:50:51] PandaTV: bear*
[8:50:54] happybooger: WoW was like my first asian chick, kind of ruined other girls for me
[8:51:04] mimsx: Yeah alot of ffxi players would call people wow babies
[8:51:07] Aravarth: @PandaTV That's why it got so popular, it was aimed at a broader audience

[9:01:17] GameWithDerp: 1999
[9:01:30] tyrel_jones: When was David Wells?
[9:01:37] tyrel_jones: Just before Cone i guess yeah
[9:01:41] GalcianBTH: funny thing is as many people will be pissed about the honor thing, the optics are actually really good for blizzard on that move lol
[9:01:44] GameWithDerp: think so yea
[9:01:57] killawatts75: im related to david cone
[9:01:58] skymercii: imagine still watching baseball
[9:02:09] Masqerader: Ya Wells was in Toronto when Cone pitched his after the trade for Clemens
[9:02:13] Legionnare92: there have been 6 or 7 no no's this year already lmao
[9:02:14] GameWithDerp: dude baseball is fun as fuck this year
[9:02:29] beaker529: hideo nomo best windup
[9:02:30] GalcianBTH: making it harder will go well with the streamers and content creators
[9:02:43] SilkeySmooth: its 19,000 honor per gear piece
[9:02:59] SilkeySmooth: fpr hw
[9:03:08] Masqerader: I hate the slow methodical pitchers, I like guys who come set and pitch
[9:03:09] GalcianBTH: yup
[9:03:18] obe_rm: !ui
[9:03:32] GalcianBTH: it makes you get about 800-1000hr per honor
[9:03:38] obe_rm: !UI
[9:03:39] GalcianBTH: if lucky
[9:03:58] GameWithDerp: haha, nolan ryan would walk around the mount like in between every pitch
[9:04:06] sleepypanda46: Hi guys, can i get the weakaura with the XP somewhere?
[9:04:14] tyrel_jones: I was always a Billy Wagner fan
[9:04:19] tyrel_jones: As a STL fan even
[9:04:24] SilkeySmooth: and how much does the gw gear costs 19.000 jonor
[9:04:26] GameWithDerp: we would throw one at your head at 99, walk around the mount slow , then throw it 102 over the middle and you were bailing out to left field
[9:04:29] GalcianBTH: and the 2h cost almost 40k so yea 50hrs for a weapon
[9:04:31] CritcobainTV: yeah its fuckin BAD lmao Im about to get 200 honor for an AB loss, the weapon is 19125 honor
[9:04:54] cineris_3: glad I grinded out 40k honor today lol

[9:05:09] gingerbeardmahn: netherwind server is popping off about that nerf now
[9:05:12] SilkeySmooth: in got my hw weapons already im just going to afk marks
[9:05:18] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i think the issue comes from them nerfing it to the original prepatch honor gain, but the original prepatch was 5.5 weeks, we only have 2 lol
[9:05:22] GalcianBTH: meh not worth now, just going to do something else, it was just a bonus.
[9:05:38] GameWithDerp: just watched a bunch of nolan ryan highlights recently actually .. hitting was completly different back then ... half the players bailed out and swung like high schoolers tbh -- probably because one could come at your head at any minute
[9:05:47] GameWithDerp: especially when he was on the mets
[9:06:03] SilkeySmooth: you will need marks for lvl 70 pvp gear
[9:06:48] Taylormade2711: for fresh boosted toons what would be best dungeon to run?
[9:07:09] GalcianBTH: its funny because its hard to complain about it and not be a hypocrite with all the other stuff the community talks about
[9:07:45] MainlyHigh: what ui are u using toweliee
[9:08:01] Aravarth: DKs start with 12-slot bags, I don't think that's a "yikes", I just think ppl are being cranky

[9:08:17] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee at lvl 70 u can buy 70 gear from the honor vendor
[9:08:18] mavericks312: in the words of a wise man just get good
[9:08:20] Eraste: just get good and play arena and stomp those nerds KEKW
[9:08:21] CritcobainTV: with the honor and marks

[9:08:54] Holysal: they can buy 70 honor gear
[9:08:58] killsJacob: Glad I got both my weapons :)
[9:09:18] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i just whispered u the advantage
[9:09:20] GalcianBTH: no ones going to be leveling in the open world. its decent gear but dung will replace it by 65
[9:09:22] SilkeySmooth: step in area with full lvl 70 honor gear before everyone else
[9:09:28] GalcianBTH: so its a nice boost from 60-65
[9:09:39] cokiextv: wtf lay of hands 1 hour cd lol
[9:09:40] dalaraz: they farm it they dont get it for free,we can all do the same
[9:09:43] pronkk_: jsut hit 300 jc
[9:09:43] cokiextv: wow
[9:09:47] Holysal: it is bc they can buy 70 honor gear in tbc @Towelliee
[9:10:04] jumpsupp: How did you get details to work?
[9:10:05] GalcianBTH: blizzard probably runs GDKP runs and realized they would all be empty
[9:10:09] Blastaho: you got your UI where did you get it from
[9:10:11] Blastaho: ?
[9:10:11] CritcobainTV: @GalcianBTH weapons for melee mostly dont get replaced until 70
[9:10:14] Eraste: surprised theyre not resetting honor in 2 weeks
[9:10:28] TacticalWee: lol
[9:10:28] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[9:10:43] dalaraz: why would they reset it,it would make game unplayable for a big chunk of people atm
[9:10:44] GalcianBTH: id say JUST getting weapons is still a doable ammount.
[9:10:59] bgriff87: D:
[9:11:03] ChanJustWon: tru
[9:11:16] pikaisthegoat: shes bloated
[9:11:23] Skizzurp: yea ur behind
[9:11:31] Eraste: ya that shouldnt happen
[9:11:33] SilkeySmooth: yes and they can go right in to arena
[9:11:36] bgriff87: Yeah that will be changed
[9:11:36] dalaraz: people carry on millions of gold,20 marks is your problem ? :p
[9:11:37] Farenheight451: you forgot about the apothecary instructions so soon this is why you didnt get invited to the wrath gate party @Towelliee
[9:11:44] ixiya_ink: Yes
[9:11:47] roflpotamus: so thats probably why people were actually farming it lmao
[9:11:53] Holysal: yes
[9:11:56] Eraste: nah i hope they reset honor and marks
[9:12:02] mimsx: with cap you can only get like two items though
[9:12:20] Holysal: @Eraste they arent
[9:12:25] dalaraz: they wont reset it,and if you dont want em have that "advandage" we can all farm marks atm
[9:12:29] Tofter: well they're not gonna reset the honor and you still need the same marks just Eye of the storm marks too now
[9:12:30] Eraste: @Eraste well, they should
[9:12:50] dalaraz: @Eraste well they shouldnt
[9:12:59] Eraste: @Eraste they should
[9:13:06] GalcianBTH: marks no, honor wont matter because of how little it is now by comparison
[9:13:18] dalaraz: peole work for something,why should they lose it? cause you wont do it ?
[9:13:26] CritcobainTV: it's just because it's the same set
[9:13:28] SilkeySmooth: premade groups are going to own in arena at launch
[9:13:31] Skizzurp: that sounds about right for classic tho
[9:13:35] CritcobainTV: @dalaraz beacuse people farmed it in premades and then blizz nerfed it for other people
[9:13:35] Eraste: cause its in a different game. don't be stupid KEKW
[9:13:58] ixiya_ink: It was a thing from classic to tbc and tbc to wotlk, farming honor and tokens before the new xpac
[9:14:23] dalaraz: @critcobain still they worked for it,you cant punish em

[9:25:23] GalcianBTH: about 50 50
[9:25:31] Hazno: yeah, people feeling "scammed" or something
[9:25:45] GalcianBTH: ive moved on to finishing level another alt lol
[9:26:01] simoncornell: everybody getting boosted and they, its a joke, was that like this back in the day?
[9:26:05] Eraste: ya they'll just revert the honor change and simultaneously drop another store mount KEKW
[9:26:09] GalcianBTH: not to this extent
[9:26:20] GalcianBTH: problem is how affordable it is lol
[9:26:29] Artivicii: deep wood?
[9:26:33] daftmath: destiny shreds with that seal talent, whatever is better for fast weapons
[9:26:35] MasqureMan: I wanna find my BC Brady games strategy guide. It’s around somewhere
[9:26:40] Holysal: i will take it lol
[9:26:53] GalcianBTH: I just refuse to spend any more of the 8.5k I have saved for TBC
[9:26:59] Hazno: @simoncornell the leveling buff didn't come until later in TBC back then, so no, it wasn't this extreme, if that's what you're talking about
[9:27:01] simoncornell: how much gold u need for lvl 60 to get boosted? 2k ? u could afford 2 legal blizz boosts for the same $ amount
[9:27:10] painfll: hi
[9:27:36] Farenheight451: well you cant boost new races and you can only do one boost so

[9:28:04] Rellik13: Zenruken
[9:28:04] GalcianBTH: basically comes down to peer presure
[9:28:06] Hazno: @simoncornell you can only pay to boost 1 character total on your account, and you can't use that boost on draenei/belf
[9:28:08] Eraste: ya thats why im playing feral. idc i just wanna play whats fun to me
[9:28:40] GalcianBTH: TBC is atleast alot less expensive to play at that high level
[9:28:42] roflpotamus: my lord mage ports are expensive rn
[9:28:43] simoncornell: im leveling legal lol seems im minority
[9:28:48] GalcianBTH: without the insane consume costs

[9:28:53] simoncornell: legal regular w.e my type of fun
[9:29:00] Hazno: @simoncornell you're in the vast majority
[9:30:34] GalcianBTH: TBC just asks way less of you time wise to play at that level. No waiting around for world buffs, no 800g of min max potions and flasks so yea the raid exp itself and gearing may be sweaty but it wont be as time exaustive
[9:30:37] nikodemuscrowley: what is that xp bar is it a wa?
[9:30:44] Xugodx2012: I have not clue what server I even want to play on lol
[9:30:55] WayneG947: i bought a pair and have worn them for like 5 hours total, my iwn fauly when i need glasses later in life

[9:32:59] xALcaPWNedx: well on our way to shadowlands classic. the mastermind re-release cash out
[9:33:03] goosejamss: wrath classic?
[9:33:05] EKS90_: I would love to get up to cata atleast, in classic, cause i loooved cata untill Dragon soul
[9:33:14] Disciple42: don't forget withered army missions!
[9:33:23] Artivicii: mop was good times tbh
[9:33:32] Gogglebert: @Disciple42 don't remind me....
[9:33:36] TheUnknowing: I'd go with legion if we had to pick between the two honestly
[9:33:37] skymercii: i want my mop cloak cus i couldnt get it bk then
[9:33:41] balart: @Towelliee lets pray sylvanas bow is as rare as aman'thuls
[9:33:47] Hazno: and when you FINALLY get your legendary drop, the bonus effect is completely useless for your spec
[9:33:48] NovaSun84: i would love leggo tokens then you get to pick
[9:33:49] nixter93: hell yeah towellie TBC hype!
[9:33:52] Disciple42: I loved MOP
[9:33:55] TheUnknowing: I liked MoP but idk
[9:33:57] Farenheight451: I like the old talent tree :) i think i am in the minority in that
[9:34:03] MasqureMan: @towelliee the effort in retail is that no one wants to do Torghast
[9:34:07] SilkeySmooth: id play a classic mop and legion 100%
[9:34:12] Disciple42: I honestly think they should stop at WoLTK for the classic releases
[9:34:21] Hazno: @disciple42 ageeed
[9:34:27] TheUnknowing: blizz wants everyone to have everything now, its just how it is.
[9:34:32] EKS90_: i still think beginning of cata / firelands part of cata was some of the most fun i have ever had in wow.
[9:34:42] Thoreya: I’m intrigued by the new torghast changes
[9:34:50] TheUnknowing: loved firelands @Commander_Eggi
[9:34:50] EvenStevenTyler: by the time we get to wotlk the entire classic community is going to be gold capped ;-;
[9:35:00] Thoreya: Even methodfleks says it’s good in ptr. That’s when you know
[9:35:03] Hazno: Torghast is becoming more of an actual roguelike now
[9:35:06] MickyFresc: plus it's also repeatable so if you really really want to grind soul ash, you can
[9:35:09] Thoreya: Not methodfleks. Fleks
[9:35:10] Hazno: which is a good thing
[9:35:14] TheUnknowing: dont worry, i won't, but i don't try so @EvenStevenTyler
[9:35:16] Eraste: ah, yes, modern blizzard, "Your expansion will be enjoyable by "#.3"
[9:35:17] skymercii: i mained a havoc dh back then and i had gotten both my bis came from opening a blingatron box
[9:35:28] TheUnknowing: Actually having stuff in torghast is great
[9:35:42] Farenheight451: you going to hit 20 in this zone for sure with these drop rates haha
[9:35:44] EKS90_: @TheUnknowing yeah 100% I will always stand by that cata was great untill DS atleast, i was not a huge fan of that, but I tanked in FL HC and fuck me it was not easy hah
[9:35:45] deltagoatactual: kinda low drop rate last i recall
[9:35:49] TheUnknowing: thats what torghast needed that it lacks, incentive.
[9:35:53] MickyFresc: @Eraste it's been enjoyable from the start, at least for me.. no reason to get bent out of shape with them making improvements
[9:36:12] MoxX228: Better, but is it more fun?
[9:36:14] grumpy_1969: Ok so mwhere do we get the Warp Stalker Mount?
[9:36:15] TheUnknowing: DS is what killed cata for me, everything up to it I loved though @Commander_Eggi
[9:36:17] Eraste: @themcfresh what? bfa sucked until 8.2, and SL is absolutely dead...
[9:36:23] Hazno: agreed
[9:36:34] Hazno: better to iterate than give up
[9:36:51] MickyFresc: @Eraste Maybe it's just because I'm newer to the game but I'm still really enjoying SL
[9:36:52] EKS90_: @TheUnknowing I agree, i loved the dungeons and the first 3 raids then FL and then ds came and i was like yeah no im out, resubbed when mop came out haha
[9:36:59] Lazugo: Now that you can conduits from adament caults is even better
[9:36:59] Frustrated_Nerd: @Towelliee I would like them to use old bosses as if Torghast is the players nightmare.
[9:37:07] MasqureMan: Problem is that me and my friends stopped playing partly because of Torghast. It just burned out my friends and I couldn’t justify it
[9:37:18] thatquidproquo: I quit retail in the beginning of WoD, right after MoP. IRL responsibilities plus the game got stale. Classic brought me back hard.
[9:37:23] skymercii: @themcfresh "sl is dead" thats called a patch drought it happens every patch simplSHRUG
[9:37:28] Eraste: @themcfresh well dont get me wrong, SL started great. the drought is pitiful and unacceptable, but despite that there were still a ton of flaws they're improving upon
[9:37:31] Hazno: @masqureman yeah, that's what they're addressing in 9.1
[9:37:40] Eraste: blizz keeps launching shit systems in the first patches and fixing them later. we shouldnt be supporting that
[9:37:44] D3m0nHunt3r666: you used to leave at like 20~ or 21
[9:37:50] thegreatbatzg: just hit 30 on my pally. keep it up @Towelliee  love the content
[9:38:10] TommySeeker: Was anyone able to install Towelliee's TBC ui? Just want to know if it's just me, when i press the Hammer's up button nothing gets configured
[9:38:12] Aravarth: See, for me it was never "Two chicks at the same time", because the response was, "So you could leave twice as many women unsatisfied?" lmao
[9:38:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: yeah maybe rested XP might be a factor , havent tried to do all ghostlands in one sitting :D
[9:38:31] skymercii: @Eraste a shit system in your mind is a good system is somebody else;s

[9:38:41] MickyFresc: @bloodyreapr @Eraste I mean sure it's taking longer than usual but I don't think it's their intent to delay it and make us suffer lmao. There's gotta be other factors at play still, like the fact that they're all still teleworking would be one

[9:38:59] TommySeeker: Ok thanks I'll try again
[9:39:18] MasqureMan: @hazno yeah it definitely needed to be fixed, but it’s the kind of thing that should’ve been addressed back in alpha and beta, not halfway through the year
[9:39:29] skymercii: @Eraste it was better then the hella rng that the legendary system was

[9:39:54] WSeveryn: @Towelliee some stuff worked, but when I hti escape, it's the old format and not the new one.. it's weird.
[9:40:01] Hazno: @masqureman the thing is it got great feedback during alpha and beta
[9:40:04] Eraste: retail has no redeemable factors, atm, sorry to say
[9:40:25] skymercii: thats ur opinion

[9:40:33] MasqureMan: @hazno ah, I didn’t realize that. Well fair enough
[9:40:39] Eraste: true, mine and many others. retail is a shit show
[9:40:54] skymercii: @Eraste then go play classic simplSHRUG
[9:41:08] MickyFresc: more like ever since vanilla lol, people have been saying "this is the end of wow" LUL
[9:41:15] Eraste: @Eraste i mean, i am. ive always been a retail player first. im just tired of being punched in the dick by blizzard. im hoping they make something good
[9:41:31] MasqureMan: Yeah Legion launch was very polarizing, so it’s cool to see people look back on it fondly
[9:41:39] dabinsky: The new mega dungeon looks awesome
[9:41:41] Eraste: i really hope 9.1 is fun
[9:41:43] skymercii: @Eraste it helps to have low expections LUL
[9:41:44] TheEnstraynomic: i dunno, it sounds like blizzard forcing content creators to shill, or else they
[9:41:45] Legionnare92: its liek what KD said about nba and its fans "Nba fans don’t like anything about the nba and it’s weird"
[9:41:47] Samoa92: @Towelliee so you thinking 9.1 will be good then?
[9:41:51] TheEnstraynomic: 'they'll  blacklist them permanently
[9:41:51] Disciple42: I played the hell out of Legion launch... like 16 hours a day for weeks
[9:41:56] Hazno: @masqureman yeah, but when it was tied to legendaries and rewards felt underwhelming, and some specs simply taking forever or never being able to beat the final boss, that's what made it a chore and turned people against it
[9:42:01] Legionnare92: people will complain about the present state of things, for wtvr reason
[9:42:26] MasqureMan: @hazno yeah my priest friend just literally couldn’t do it alone
[9:42:31] Eraste: im personally just worn out after the 2 years of bfa, sl drought, and the issues with tbc. blizzard is actually falling apart
[9:42:31] moodyjim: Give me back my twilight dev!
[9:42:57] digitaldemize: !level
[9:43:07] Hazno: @masqureman but that wasn't clear at all during alpha and beta, people loved the idea of a roguelike in WoW like that, but not with how it was tuned and the la lackluster rewards, so that's what they're addressing now
[9:43:15] smackyounginss: what's the best server's?
[9:43:15] xALcaPWNedx: I'm trying ff14 lol
[9:43:21] Vorog1: What unit frames are you using @towelliee ?
[9:43:27] Masqerader: somehow this wait is still shorter than Dragon Soul and SoO
[9:43:27] bruhSit_farmer: Rekon they will bring AP back towel ??
[9:43:57] skymercii: shhh they'll hear u^
[9:44:07] Waspire: good night all you lovley peeps. i made it to 30 hours.
[9:44:21] wirthy32: What addon is the experience bar up the top of the screen @towelliee
[9:44:27] Disciple42: yea, Mists pacing was really good... until the SoO drought hit
[9:45:08] digitaldemize: Will they end the classics with wotlk?
[9:45:27] T0rchez: hope so i liked wotlk :)
[9:45:40] goosejamss: DAMN get that dude some melatonin
[9:45:41] MasqureMan: Yeah, to sum up my complaints, I am forgiving of a lot of things but severely lacking reward systems directly affect how many people you lose in a content drought

[9:46:36] Disciple42: my only gripe with WoLTK was ToC... other than that, solid
[9:46:37] TheEnstraynomic: i dunno, say if WW3 happens, and directly affects blizzard HQ, i'd expect a delay longer than 9.1
[9:46:41] magemaster225: that wow moment after we kill syvlanas better be big
[9:47:02] sdmg1234: @disciple42 what was wrong with ToC?
[9:47:30] Disciple42: @sdmg1234 I hated everything about it, just my opinion

[9:49:43] AjjtheDK: I didnt rush gearing in SL. im still only 218 on my main, I dont M raid but I got my AOTC. this way I can keep myself entertained while waiting for 9.1

[9:51:23] coffeeatm: @Masqerader Probably i mean anything that has any sort of a system that use LFG to make it easyer to find groups will grind there gears so hard cause its "anti social"
[9:51:28] MoxX228: The Sunwell was a magic source
[9:51:32] 210Crawler: I agree, this is the most I seen you play a variety of games on Twitch
