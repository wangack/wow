[0:12:14] Redpeanut01: U want a personal healer ven?
[0:12:16] wackpoetic: It's like the guilds that bug out to join Epic BG's together and then farm people. They don't want a challenge they just want to win
[0:12:17] Yaycarrots: NODDERS
[0:13:00] Redpeanut01: im down

[0:13:12] belvedee: lets humble them
[0:13:14] wackpoetic: There are people who literally get their guild together on Discord to all queue into the same Epic BG then farm bots and people in greens instead of trying any of the rated PvP already in the game
[0:13:21] Fixit_cat: aVENgers, Assemble
[0:13:23] MaxAizen: Hey ! I play since 1 month and I just got my 1k8 in 2v2 x)

[0:16:12] Moobot: @mkass_f_1 Details, SArena, Omnibar, OmniCD, Big Debuffs, Weak Auras, RaiderIO addon
[0:16:34] imrobk: @Zevx meanwhile real trucks aren't even that good in the snow. the weight distribution is bad and you can't even really get good use of your all wheel drive with low weight in the back. even when i had a truck i had to shovel snow into the bed to get anywhere. most truck drivers are just... dense
[0:16:59] azliaris1: tank specs in the open with no dampening are immortal
[0:17:01] Zevx: ya they just lookin for a reason to hate on it since its electric and like 2x as powerful as their vehicle clearly KEKW @imrobk
[0:17:02] azliaris1: it's not even close
[0:17:44] BMeSharper: how many ads can i be hit with on this channel holy moly
[0:17:48] SouLzCUH: so many showed up wtf lol
[0:17:48] imrobk: @Zevx yeah lol! when we get snow in texas it's hilarious. the shoulders are just littered with abandoned trucks because people don't know how to drive in the snow. yee haw y'all 4 wheel drive!

[0:22:00] JustTaki: ven I'm trying to figure out arcane. Do you ever send clearcasting missles without 4 arcane charges or do you arcane blast or orb for full charges every time
[0:22:13] 0nly_sin: @venruki the dragon is the healer i think Keepo
[0:22:18] XxGarthakxX: I use World Buffs and all the tricks of the WPvP trade like Soullscape...these are meant for 1vX gameplay tho
[0:22:27] XxGarthakxX: Chidd hates me
[0:22:38] zachgamegodx: WAIT

[0:26:29] fr33up: @venruki I'm mainly a pve player. I main DH & Druid (Feral). I also have a disc priest that I enjoy playing... My question for you is;  Is there any classes that emmbellishments transfer from pve over to pvp? Or is it unlikely/
[0:26:46] fr33up: i want to get into pvp, so complete beginner
[0:26:49] SouLzCUH: I MEANNNNN.. its a little toxic that they do that no?
[0:26:54] mayonaes: anyone know why my monks disable is no longer showing on enemy nameplates? did blizz do something
[0:27:14] fr33up: its hard, cuzz im out of sparks :(
[0:27:26] zachgamegodx: they sharted all right
[0:27:29] gjvl: Sharted WutFace
[0:27:32] Ernanz: making my morning coffee and watching Ven has become a daily routine
[0:28:23] Redpeanut01: naaaa thats not toxic thats fucking fun
[0:28:24] Ernanz: im so sorry Ven ill be able to afford a Sub soon i swear
[0:28:24] Vylltv: I just wanna say you are the nicest streaming in wow
[0:28:26] Redpeanut01: thatsd why i ove this gamer

[0:28:32] zachgamegodx: the heel
[0:28:37] imrobk: you can't have a protagonist without an antagonist
[0:28:38] JustTaki: more fun when there's a bad guy
[0:28:43] Slayer_Eagleone: venruki i always rooted against you NGL LUL
[0:28:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa LUL
[0:28:57] Slayer_Eagleone: :)
[0:29:09] cracksonnn: hey venruki, ive been going back to retail pvp in recent time bc lack of things to do on SoD. gotta say i feel like pvp is in a good place rn, what do u think?
[0:29:12] zachgamegodx: watchin ads
[0:29:16] Slayer_Eagleone: not EVERY day
[0:29:19] Slayer_Eagleone: :D
[0:29:37] alucen: alucen gifted a Tier 1 sub to Slayer_Eagleone! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:29:38] alucen: there u go bud
[0:29:51] Slayer_Eagleone: DansGame
[0:29:51] Cvarks: what u think the priority changes should b
[0:30:03] Slayer_Eagleone: why you do that??
[0:30:18] alucen: you seem like a nice guy, wanted to do something nice for you
[0:30:22] lolyrros: im sure u get asked this 100 times but do u think splitting the player base between sod, classic, hc and retail was a good move?
[0:30:38] Slayer_Eagleone: @alucen Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:30:45] alucen: trilleLove
[0:31:03] itsKLAUUS: @lolyrros those are completely different players generally speaking, so yes
[0:31:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's not really splitting the playerbase, it's giving players more options
[0:31:07] Fros365: And as a raid you don't complete the wq either
[0:31:07] Fixit_cat: Ven's supervillain arc
[0:31:08] imrobk: @lolyrros I don't think it's splitting the player base as much as expanding on the existing player base. sure some people play both, but it's definitely 2 different games.
[0:31:13] Redpeanut01: tht was fun ty ven
[0:31:19] zachgamegodx: @lolyrros bit of a loaded question
[0:31:22] SouLzCUH: NOW JUST ONE TIME FOR THE MEMES
[0:31:29] cracksonnn: Youve been playing any sod?
[0:31:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoW has two spots in the top 5 MMORPG's, kind of like two different games
[0:31:58] Moobot: Latest video "His bot broke in my solo shuffle lobby... 💀" view it here: youtu.be/4fwvF3kGhcY
[0:32:01] mayonaes: People will ride the nostalgia trainforever
[0:32:04] SouLzCUH: i kid i kid
[0:32:08] Redpeanut01: how soon do you think they uncapp conquest..cuz the quests are pointless when your fully capped honor and conquest for the week
[0:32:30] Axtin: i got carried away and emoted that bignatures guy, but i mean bro had 50 different buffs and guardian druid kekw
[0:32:44] Emerno: they should be uncapping conq on tuesday with the patch but we'll see..
[0:33:05] belvedee: He can now say it took a raid with r1s in it to take him down. Bet he's happy lol
[0:33:09] zachgamegodx: @Axtin i cant see u doing that
[0:33:15] Redpeanut01: well the quetss will reset and thr pointless at the moment..
[0:33:15] zachgamegodx: ur too nice
[0:33:21] Cvarks: what r the main changes u think they should do?
[0:33:27] Axtin: @zachgamegodx nah i emote sub rogues all the time
[0:33:39] SouLzCUH: THEYRE ALL BACK
[0:33:43] Slayer_Eagleone: :D
[0:33:44] Redpeanut01: I agree
[0:33:44] SouLzCUH: ALL OF THEM ARE BACK
[0:33:46] Ernanz: LUL
[0:33:50] XxGarthakxX: WHERE?
[0:33:53] SouLzCUH: SAME SPOT
[0:33:53] Cvarks: (he plays arcane mage too)
[0:33:54] zachgamegodx: warlocks and ele shamans
[0:33:54] ferahgok: BASED
[0:33:54] Cvarks: KEKW
[0:33:54] Spawrro: can't really take him serious tho
[0:33:55] mayonaes: typical mage player response
[0:33:56] SouLzCUH: ALL OF THEM ARE BACK!!!
[0:33:57] Ernanz: the only thing they need to nerf is Rogues to the ground
[0:33:57] Yaycarrots: ResidentSleeper
[0:33:59] Redpeanut01: i think their mobility needs to be nerfed
[0:34:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: DK looks OP sometimes
[0:34:01] thuglovex: he’s not lying casters are just for fun
[0:34:03] Redpeanut01: way too much uptime
[0:34:04] peardraxz: why dont they just buff casters?
[0:34:10] Badasti: blizzard decided melee need 100% uptime all game
[0:34:16] Slayer_Eagleone: arcane farms every single melee in retail
[0:34:20] thuglovex: playing casters is just overwhelming the best ones are the ones w insta cast
[0:34:24] Ernanz: hear me out Ven, Rogues need to be deleted from WoW for the sake of everyone in PvP
[0:34:31] Slayer_Eagleone: :D
[0:34:32] Cvarks: even tho it should i dont think arcane will get a nerf if there is tuning
[0:34:39] Slayer_Eagleone: you can lose if you have to afk
[0:34:40] zachgamegodx: whaazz and raiku fighting each other mid game is so interesting to listen to bc between the banter there''s alot of game knowledge to pick up
[0:34:52] TheAshkandi: demo is also rediculous yet its ranged
[0:34:56] Oriem: one of their nine time rewinds and blinks probably
[0:35:04] Gotheels: nerf arcane spellsteal
[0:35:05] Redpeanut01: Melee=Roots i have a way out...fear i have a way out..Stun i have a way oiut...gate i have somethign that will get to you just as fast...port oh wait ill use my next gapo closer...its nutgs
[0:35:10] Gordon__brown: evoker is the most broken spec in the game change my mind (dont)
[0:35:17] Cvarks: well the best change i think for the game would be pris barrier and spellsteal nerf but a more reasonable nerf would prob be another 4 set nerf
[0:35:17] Sokkee: YES
[0:35:23] zachgamegodx: @venruki arcane feels like devestation evoker with a 40 yard range KEKW
[0:35:25] Nachofez: what makes arcane broken against melee?
[0:35:31] lolyrros: i dont play the game but buff anything ven plays
[0:35:37] belvedee: arcane is great rn, but is really op to the point of nerfs?
[0:35:44] Dandychase: honestly the only thing mages need a nerf in is their slow to mobility ratio, either shorten root times or dr the slow
[0:35:46] Cvarks: @belvedee yes
[0:35:53] Slayer_Eagleone: as a melee good luck touching an arcane mage
[0:35:59] belvedee: Hm, I'll trust you.
[0:36:05] XxGarthakxX: thats 1v1, 1vX Arcane is super hard to play
[0:36:07] mayonaes: It is going to be wild balancing tier sets, talents, and hero talents in the war within
[0:36:09] Redpeanut01: Ive been watching Cdew and Pres Boomer Rogue still strong AF
[0:36:14] jheas1: devoker VS most those is easy
[0:36:14] zachgamegodx: wwdk with an rsham isn't easy id imagine
[0:36:19] Dustycloudmusic: yo I unsubed when we were all stcuk 1.8cr cause mmr bug S2, is it better now?
[0:36:33] fr33up: if i wanted to get into pvp as disc (with little to no experience) do you suggest disc?
[0:36:51] Cvarks: i think a pris barrier nerf is long overdue
[0:37:02] SouLzCUH: i got your back
[0:37:03] mayonaes: lol
[0:37:05] mayonaes: rogues
[0:37:08] ZeroOmegaLul: Arcane / Devoker / Disc priest has been some of the funnest arenas ever. LUL
[0:37:11] Nadasky: rogues
[0:37:17] lundbergmackan: I am having a bad day, cant stop thinking about work tommorow, it will be a annyoing time at work :S
[0:37:22] Cvarks: *fix
[0:37:24] Cvarks: KEKW
[0:37:24] nikthevoker: was thinking about leveling DK
[0:37:31] chefskotmcd: debating an alt. have a resto Druid now. boost a rogue or warlock?!
[0:37:48] mayonaes: rogue
[0:37:50] Badasti: yo uwanna be a god or a decent caster? :D
[0:37:56] Axtin: i think blast wave is the most annoying mage ability
[0:37:57] mayonaes: play rogue you wont regret it
[0:37:59] myodoctor: how will awc work when eu and na have some different teir sets?
[0:37:59] Hiraad: I see no reason to nerf arcane, they dont have op dmg and you need to be really good to play it compared to other specs,classes
[0:38:02] asdfhoonz: What's better in warrior/mage/x?  Frost or arcane?
[0:38:26] zachgamegodx: it was balanced when it was on a choice row with blink stuff
[0:38:29] zachgamegodx: blastwave
[0:38:31] Cvarks: ya 100%
[0:38:35] Cvarks: 10 sec is wild
[0:38:35] Badasti: yeah unless you queue into a shaman or priest
[0:38:42] Ignite_CLO: if you are not a mage, everything a mage does is annoying Kappa
[0:38:44] Badasti: or a hunter that rng tranqs it
[0:38:48] Badasti: or dh
[0:38:52] Ignite_CLO: true
[0:38:57] Ignite_CLO: and real
[0:39:05] Axtin: ya every class has gotten really annoying stuff
[0:39:14] Axtin: shaman has become the most annoying class by far i think
[0:39:15] imrobk: if you aren't annoyed by a class or jealous of their tools the balance is bad
[0:39:24] zachgamegodx: i think classes that you can trade with are less annoying even if they're oppressive
[0:39:28] Slayer_Eagleone: LUL YUP SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT
[0:39:37] zachgamegodx: like destro locks can trade super well and tank dmg and just win that way
[0:40:39] SouLzCUH: i finally just killed that rogue that was killing you lol
[0:41:02] Hiraad: lets talk about nerfing warlock cc before we touch mages

[0:54:17] Slayer_Eagleone: so how does one tell if its healer diff or dps diff?
[0:54:33] Badasti: You need to focus on their shins more than their ankles
[0:54:37] Ambersulfr: yo

[0:55:39] yepbeef: fury feels odd
[0:55:40] Ernanz: where's the proves? Jk
[0:55:47] rekt1370: only downside of fury is ms effect and bladestorm other than that fury pumps harder
[0:55:53] Ambersulfr: how do you live the bm hunter zoo on frost mage?
[0:55:55] danieljjohnsonn: wheres the patch class updates??

[0:56:38] Nachofez: we all hate crusader
[0:56:41] smoothytoothy: how about how he act? LUL @shooklate
[0:56:47] asdfhoonz: crusader seems annoying to play with
[0:56:48] Waflestomper: maybe its because he's a psychopath?
[0:57:06] Ernanz: blames his teammaes for even breathing in the arena lol
[0:57:29] thuglovex: his mom made him sit in a booster seat til he was 16 if that helps explain his mental instability
[0:57:32] Feracks: who does that?
[0:57:33] thuglovex: also fatherless
[0:57:51] olairio: is that your character that sounds likea  cat or something else lol?
[0:57:54] rekt1370: yea crusader had a rough childhood thats for sure
[0:58:00] thuglovex: idk if you guys saw that video of his mom smacking him in the face w his keyboard making him bleed too
[0:58:08] Waflestomper: brohoes before hunter bows
[0:58:30] dprims8: wow brings it out of us
[0:58:33] ferahgok: Honestly, I think you have it backwards and the tik tok is an act.

[1:00:08] rembrandt89: idk I’ve seen his Twitter where he literally refers to himself as “the melesto” something ain’t all there
[1:00:12] nargonisttv: Gnomercy
[1:00:13] taylorperiod: GM GOOD SIR
[1:00:13] Vallekk: Fury is so much fun, I have no idea how it'd be better than arms for pvp but it's a lot of fun
[1:00:15] Waflestomper: @Ozerkek agreed
[1:00:15] shugguls: tbh i just want spear back
[1:00:16] Ernanz: fury so much better for WPvp, 1v1 and such
[1:00:18] nightmxz: Good morning Ven, how are you doing?

[1:02:07] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[1:02:15] ur_boy_jd: ven whats up buddy
[1:02:22] zachgamegodx: @havenblood not really, because of thunderous words being below thunderous roar you have to take roar on both in pvp
[1:02:24] supatease: 1 healer = 5 dps with no dampening
[1:02:26] zachgamegodx: bc you're so bleed oriented
[1:02:37] Bixster: the only good gnome is a bad gnome SMOrc
[1:02:44] Bixster: dead gnome
[1:03:06] zachgamegodx: for fury, ur more forced into roar over spear bc you need the wild strikes passive on fury
[1:03:08] zachgamegodx: insane dps boost
[1:03:12] taylorperiod: yooooo sounds so dope!
[1:03:15] ur_boy_jd: sounds like you were just playing laser tag
[1:03:16] dcode200: have you ever played Hunter ven? dont think i have ever seen you play it.

[1:05:02] five_moke: friggen Lazers!
[1:05:08] nightmxz: Oh yeah there's something like this near me too
[1:05:12] storebraad: the only better race then gnomes are Nelfs... females. The issue - the most gnomes are being played by the most obnoxius sort of human kind with a blizzard account and people link that to gnomes :O
[1:05:20] Bixster: its like the movie the cube without dying?
[1:05:22] Ernanz: is that in the US?
[1:05:27] Slayer_Eagleone: COOL
[1:05:42] Vallekk: This seems really cool
[1:05:47] ItsBees: Just saw that story Pog

[1:08:46] JustTaki: Not in pvp
[1:08:48] shugguls: u can but no has to 2400
[1:08:51] wackpoetic: 1H Fury is spending extra talent points to do less damage
[1:09:10] Shezzmou: SMF looks less cool and does less damage
[1:09:18] nikthevoker: i want to use boost on DK when i can afford to get 2 expacs i need LUL
[1:09:26] yepbeef: im always broke
[1:09:28] shugguls: races ?
[1:09:31] ItsBees: old raids

[1:09:50] ZealotryTV: 20k/week per toon
[1:09:53] iTzKraynos: like 2k a day

[1:10:06] thuglovex: yeah that’s all I do
[1:10:06] five_moke: gold is redic ez to make nowadays if ur broke ur not trying to
[1:10:11] ShaHugs: if the dream zone gold buff is up  you can get 1200-1600 gold per gold wq (not races)
[1:10:17] Morodox: easiest way to make gold is using ur credit card
[1:10:23] gajobgoo: or just stream and receive money from viewers
[1:10:32] ZealotryTV: if you also have the circle of blood quest in ohnaran plains with the magpies buff its like 2-3k per toon
[1:10:34] Ernanz: hahaha
[1:10:41] thuglovex: I have yet to buy 1 WoW token and I have a bunch of alts
[1:10:43] lishyluu: might as well do WQs during the 45 minute queue
[1:10:44] zachgamegodx: cdew earned 1 mill gold the otha day
[1:10:47] zachgamegodx: or 3 mill
[1:10:47] tigerslap_ow: the expansions level boosted character comes with renown 20 with the main 4. that's a huge boost.
[1:10:49] zachgamegodx: i forget
[1:10:50] Immortal1266: if you have a ton of alts you can do the soup every week on all alts then sell the flavor packet that can drop. its about 70k a piece on my server
[1:10:58] shivwren: Making people like you, the real grind
[1:11:06] ZealotryTV: the biggest hack is just farming herbs/ores during qs
[1:11:07] GiiGa07: I make all day gold with crafting orders
[1:11:08] Morodox: @havenblood step 1: have 50,000 viewers
[1:11:20] Ernanz: Asmon got a lot of simps
[1:11:21] Badasti: id rather be poor
[1:11:22] rembrandt89: idk I watched palumor get gold cap from viewers in one day lol
[1:12:02] five_moke: when this patch came out I farmed the BOE gear for an hour and sold it on ah, made 200k for 1 hour of farming

[1:14:08] Ambersulfr: always rsham
[1:14:09] rembrandt89: gathering doesn’t make shit for gold right now
[1:14:10] ZealotryTV: its not
[1:14:12] Spawrro: gathering sucks now because bots are abundant
[1:14:12] nargonisttv: You don't make shit from gathering
[1:14:17] ZealotryTV: i make the most gold from gathering
[1:14:19] ItsBees: I do Sadge
[1:14:23] Spawrro: its good at the beginning of the expansion when everything is expensive
[1:14:24] Axtin: @ZealotryTV give us numbers
[1:14:25] iloveyalunn: Bots ruined gathering
[1:14:27] Morodox: gathering is only good at the start of an expansion
[1:14:31] Bronloch: how is Ret coming along? btw
[1:14:31] Ambersulfr: as soon as they put old riding back in the game the bots came back
[1:14:41] ZealotryTV: @axtin 10-15k/hour
[1:14:52] Axtin: dude... lol
[1:15:05] iloveyalunn: Better off getting a minimum wage job and buying tokens
[1:15:06] five_moke: u hurt his feeling

[1:15:06] Spawrro: Working for 1 hour lets me get a wow token for the month, seems easier
[1:15:10] Axtin: thats nothing
[1:15:22] Axtin: 10 hours for not even half a wow token
[1:15:23] ericpowerful: Could sell 2s wins for gold
[1:15:24] nargonisttv: I just buy a wow token once a month
[1:15:28] nargonisttv: easy done gold
[1:15:28] SteLawBro: Enhance is def one of the top 1v1 classes in the game atm. Thhey can do so much.
[1:15:35] ZealotryTV: i mean it covers what i need. im not going to sit and farm trade chat for 5k a craft
[1:15:40] JustTaki: lol

[1:51:58] imrobk: I love fiction for books and audiobooks, but i watch a shit ton of science youtubers
[1:52:03] pepsiflex: read "The First Law" series (EPIC)
[1:52:04] Ambersulfr: I like to read web comics on my phone when I’m bored.
[1:52:24] Yaycarrots: i've been listening to the wheel of time audiobooks over and over again for like 10 years PepeHands
[1:52:31] ryanblue98: why do they pop all defensives after you cacoon them
[1:52:43] imrobk: @Yaycarrots I love those narrators, and I am so glad that Brandon Sanderson uses them.
[1:52:57] Yaycarrots: yeah, they're amazing
[1:53:00] Ambersulfr: they’re short so I can read a few and avoid the risk of hyper-focusing on a novel and coming up for air in 6 hours
[1:53:04] Badasti: @venruki would recommend Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy. Loved those books
[1:53:17] Sokkee: @venruki PLS make a video about the worst mmr systhem in soloq ever its so riggt

[1:54:39] Phorians: I like King's less horror-ish books, last one was The Institute that had ridicilous sounding synopsis but I really liked it
[1:54:52] rekt1370: yea holy pally with casters super strong
[1:54:58] zachgamegodx: as warrior it's a nightmare
[1:54:58] rekt1370: mage holy pally is busted
[1:55:01] zachgamegodx: paladin anything frankly
[1:55:11] Varaben: freedom lasts so long on short cd
[1:55:16] InkdAdam: I honestly think pal is 2nd best healer
[1:55:28] rekt1370: pallys not good vs double caster tho
[1:55:46] SixtyNine1987: It feels good, because as the paladin, we're all the melee anyone needs while being able to dish out off heals, and helpful CD's that come in clutch.. The ranged DPS makes up for the wheelchair aspect of our class
[1:56:10] zachgamegodx: @rekt1370 have ya seen ppl play 3's? we're not in a caster meta rly
[1:56:19] rekt1370: theres a shit ton of casters
[1:56:24] rekt1370: mage lock ele lock

[1:57:49] SixtyNine1987: That was kinda nuts
[1:58:22] doriansdonuts: I've had 3 solo shuffles back to back being full globed by rogues KEKHeim
[1:58:32] muhlum24: just warlock things
[1:58:49] ameloly: its 3 melees
[1:58:54] ameloly: lock whould go 0-6 lol
[2:00:16] Bourbons86: i just got 2 instant queues in a row on dps, but of course someone didnt accept in each one, and now next queue pop will be 25 minutes later :)
[2:00:33] vmewo: @ameloly its 3 melees but with an hpal healer so lock I think wins those
[2:01:14] Nylx89: do you think any class changes before awc?
[2:01:29] rekt1370: yea holy pally vs melee with no purge is giga strong
[2:01:30] Hatchetking213: what makes them op rn have they gotten any changes?
[2:01:42] rekt1370: 2 freedoms 2 10 second bops
[2:01:46] belvedee: Bop into all these melee very strong
[2:01:49] smitesucks: purge doesnt even counter pally that hard anyone because of glimmers
[2:01:52] Bourbons86: they are good in shuffle i think because of the strong cds and fast dampening
[2:01:59] Bourbons86: rdruids still gods though imo
[2:02:02] Bourbons86: in comparison
[2:02:06] JarJar_Brinkz: That's how it works yeah
[2:02:12] healmeshammy: you para and sweep opener with sack up was kinda waste
[2:02:13] JarJar_Brinkz: But that moment is disgusting

[2:06:28] zachgamegodx: @borngood having him play it in the green gear is evil tho
[2:06:39] zachgamegodx: 😭
[2:06:43] Borngood: @zachgamegodx can use some ret gear it's fine for his purposes
[2:06:45] Varaben: emergency poop
[2:07:29] Varaben: how does the holy pally gear differ from Ret? does holy want more crit or what

[2:26:52] Schnellmusic: prioritize word of glory so you don't overcap
[2:26:59] zachgamegodx: your crit chance is low so you don’t get many infusion procs
[2:27:02] snakefizz: daybreak makes ur next 3 holy shocks god mode
[2:27:03] wreklol: @Schnellmusic actually dont do that
[2:27:08] zachgamegodx: so you spend more mana bc flash isn’t free
[2:27:10] wreklol: it does the least healing and most mana
[2:27:19] Schnellmusic: @wreklol lol

[2:28:17] Xiyoth: KEKW
[2:28:21] wreklol: its actually your gear. you dont have enough crit. you should simply holy shock until you get a proc of infusion then cast flash of light. WOG when you need instants and trade daybreak with their big CDs
[2:28:26] JarJar_Brinkz: That's 1600 for you LUL
[2:28:40] zachgamegodx: born said he didn’t need any crit so he didn’t get any
[2:28:43] RonWilson: crit's also very good
[2:28:53] RonWilson: you have a talent that make crit heals do 20% more
[2:28:54] Rzzzi: dudes invisible
[2:28:55] wreklol: i'm all crit/mastery. 16% vers
[2:28:56] Gage_92: need at least 25% crit
[2:29:00] zachgamegodx: meanwhile nobody on ladder below 25% crit out of PvP
[2:29:00] ThoGreyTTV: I think Mastery / Crit depends on lobbies too. Mastery is less good with casters for example.
[2:29:02] wackpoetic: do you have precog?
[2:29:03] bransby09: Mastery really only is felt when your super close to them at about 10-15 feet away you feel the diff
[2:29:03] cognacbear: topping you should be okayyyy
[2:29:10] BCboy_: INVIS HACK
[2:29:13] Schnellmusic: Borngood has a PHD in WoW data
[2:29:20] galadice: born is the goat so
[2:29:24] ThoGreyTTV: But a melee lobby where  your mastery is pure 100% uptime ( because of being close to beacons / eachother ) gives Great healing.
[2:29:35] ThoGreyTTV: Also, you don't oom that often in Solo Shuffle anyways.
[2:29:36] wreklol: @bransby09 mastery works on both beacons. so its more valuable when healing cleaves where your team is stacked
[2:29:39] Schnellmusic: @ThoGreyTTV  that's not how mastery works anymore.  new talent checks distance to your beacon too
[2:29:40] zachgamegodx: i think borns pranking ven
[2:29:46] RonWilson: you have beacons on everyone
[2:29:50] RonWilson: so you don't need to be close to anyone
[2:29:52] Gage_92: you have 2 beacons
[2:29:54] Schnellmusic: ^
[2:29:56] ThoGreyTTV: @Schnellmusic Yes that I know, I said that In caster lobbies, it's not good because htey are not close to each other.
[2:30:04] likeewlock: its because of ur diablo mount
[2:30:04] Geowind: I have a noob question I got some conquest gear as  resto druid should I put some intellect enchants on them? I can buy off the auction house
[2:30:04] RonWilson: it doesn't matter
[2:30:11] Gage_92: gives 2 people a cheat death
[2:30:13] RonWilson: you don't need your beacons to be close to eachother
[2:30:13] Schnellmusic: you get 100% mastery benefit on the players that beacon is on
[2:30:16] ThoGreyTTV: Casters don't want to stand next to each other. so mastery has less value for example.
[2:30:17] Schnellmusic: cause they're 0yards away lol
[2:30:19] RonWilson: having a beacon gives you 100% mastery
[2:30:27] ThoGreyTTV: Is it?
[2:30:31] Schnellmusic: Duh
[2:30:32] JarJar_Brinkz: It's for your one shot macro Pog
[2:30:37] RonWilson: yeah if you picked the talent for it
[2:30:41] RonWilson: beacon gives you 100% mastery value
[2:30:41] ThoGreyTTV: Isn't it they need  to be close to each other ?
[2:30:45] RonWilson: nope
[2:30:45] swolegreekgod: Reeseboss is a r1 hpally from EU I'm sure he could give you a few pointers
[2:30:46] ThoGreyTTV: Like both beacosn close to each other?
[2:30:52] Schnellmusic: No
[2:31:00] RonWilson: as long as they have a beacon on them it's as if you're inside their anus
[2:31:09] bransby09: Oh its the talent beacon of the lightrbringer
[2:31:11] BCboy_: how does your character keep getting invisible bug
[2:31:16] zachgamegodx: @swolegreekgod unless he’s in here, no  pt in saying that
[2:31:42] swolegreekgod: @zachgamegodx fair enough, ill ping him on discord and see if he's busy
[2:31:57] ThoGreyTTV: Damn you guys are right.
[2:32:06] RonWilson: also crit is huge, you get free flashes of light and every crit heal basically heals for 20% more
[2:32:06] zachgamegodx: we’ve already got the great born good giving him help
[2:32:07] ThoGreyTTV: Well nevermind then lmao. I do play full mastery with a tint of crit tho.
[2:32:08] RonWilson: cause of a talent
[2:32:09] bransby09: Yea about 12 million in a shuffle and im oom ish
[2:32:10] Outer_Limitz: warrior lobby what can you do
[2:33:19] FlibbityFloyd: miesruki over here
[2:33:20] Moobot: Latest video "We Tried The Most Broken Duo In PvP" view it here: youtu.be/wCEIaMfsDkQ
[2:33:24] zachgamegodx: @ronwilson crits are nerfed in PvP jsyk
[2:33:30] ThoGreyTTV: Melee wings is pretty dead isn't it? Tried it a few times but seems like I do no healing at all.
[2:33:40] BCboy_: Brainruki
[2:33:43] zachgamegodx: the reason you want crit is for more infusions, mastery is more output always
[2:34:06] RonWilson: the talent that makes your crits do 20% more healing is not nerfed in arena
[2:34:08] wreklol: @ThoGreyTTV it's so bad. sucks because it's a ton of fun
[2:34:18] zachgamegodx: crits are tho @ronwilson they are halved
[2:34:18] RonWilson: and after 50% every 1% of crit heals overall more than 1% of mastery
[2:34:20] RonWilson: jsyk
[2:34:27] Nightbot: Here is the offical Venruki Discord: https://discord.gg/SGNHyz3Mah
[2:34:27] zachgamegodx: no
[2:34:28] RonWilson: still
[2:34:29] RonWilson: yes
[2:34:32] zachgamegodx: crits are halved
[2:34:35] zachgamegodx: in PvP
[2:34:40] sbrees: where is your character
[2:34:42] RonWilson: you've said that 15 times
[2:34:45] zachgamegodx: that’s why they use mastery
[2:34:47] RonWilson: still though I did the testing
[2:34:55] RonWilson: it heals more
[2:34:57] ThoGreyTTV: Crit healing isn't nerfed afaik?
[2:35:03] skez_live: im so sick of facing r-druids lol
[2:35:04] ThoGreyTTV: It's crit damage no?
[2:35:12] DerDustyTv: the first time I see you live and not on YouTube ^^
[2:35:12] JarJar_Brinkz: HUHH
[2:35:16] Borngood: nt
[2:35:18] RonWilson: crits are nerfed in pvp
[2:35:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Resto druid was a bear
[2:35:26] zachgamegodx: then why does every Paladin have double mastery to crit @ronwilson
[2:35:43] RonWilson: for 1 main reason
[2:35:49] Kalakbar: no discomfort, no expansion
[2:35:53] RonWilson: mastery rating is double crit rating in terms of percentages
[2:35:53] Shezzmou: lol rest druid almost died several times. Does summer need to go on targets that hit harder or more often?
[2:35:56] Schnellmusic: @Borngood can you give some hpal feedback, chat is all disagreeing \
[2:35:57] Borngood: tbh just read ur spellbook ull be good
[2:35:58] Borngood: haha
[2:35:59] net_mi: you gotta do some dps to generate holy power
[2:36:06] JarJar_Brinkz: @Borngood KEKL
[2:36:10] zachgamegodx: no it’s the value @ronwilson https://drustvar.com/character/us/tichondrius/shazuwu

[2:36:17] net_mi: melee with crusader strike

[2:36:52] Slayer_Eagleone: its actually NOT bad advice
[2:36:52] imrobk: cant believe borngood is griefing you so hard
[2:36:54] explic_cit: rtfm wow edition
[2:36:55] Taevenx: borngood trying to make peeps as smart as he is
[2:37:04] JarJar_Brinkz: TOo yellow
[2:37:14] ripzaddo: cant be gnome
[2:37:14] Kalakbar: Ven: "I'm struggling, can you help" Born: "have you not done the 6-week correspondence course?"
[2:37:15] JarJar_Brinkz: No hots
[2:37:16] ThoGreyTTV: That's the most passive aggressive thing to say, Hey mate, go read in your spellbook ( That's actually something i'm going to use in Solo shuffle now lol )
[2:37:17] imrobk: only 1 spell school?
[2:37:17] Outer_Limitz: too many cool downs?
[2:37:18] Vita51: that wog sucks
[2:37:19] Taevenx: it's the same class as ret? Kappa
[2:37:22] saitama_v2: you have to cast
[2:37:22] Borngood: holy power prob
[2:37:25] snakefizz: mana
[2:37:26] sch3ming: Is warrior doing well in higher brackets? Solo shuffle seems tough sometimes
[2:37:27] swolegreekgod: @Kalakbar hahaha
[2:37:28] ThoGreyTTV: I know borngood isn't passive aggressif on that one, before someone points it out to me
[2:37:31] thisisthotcaller: It makes you consider your sins and how the holy light affects you
[2:37:31] ZakEntreri: when start 10.2.5 ?
[2:37:31] zachgamegodx: @kalakbar ROFL
[2:37:32] Borngood: it's bad, can be better
[2:37:34] RonWilson: @zachgamegodx making sure you're able to read, crit overscales mastery above 50% mastery
[2:37:34] jsxywoh: Real and true
[2:37:36] Borngood: maybe 1 day
[2:37:37] Shmobby: holy power ruined hpal
[2:37:37] Yaycarrots: holy power sucks
[2:37:38] Outer_Limitz: do you like it for ret?
[2:37:45] rocka10388: I hate that they put 3k mana cost on wog
[2:37:47] snakefizz: holy power fuels ur weakest spells. makes sense
[2:37:48] Varaben: it feels bad for healers to have combo points
[2:37:52] nightmxz: Holy power is just the chi of healers man what is there to hate
[2:37:53] BCboy_: Think every pala hates it
[2:37:55] Taevenx: blizz making pally use HP and mana to heal is wack
[2:38:00] RonWilson: I don't ever wog
[2:38:07] Vita51: praying for it to be removed again next xpac
[2:38:10] RonWilson: unless I have 2 stacks of the thingy
[2:38:10] Varaben: but it makes sense for Ret and prot so they just shoe horned it into holy
[2:38:12] KralHor: im ok with it, but dont make me cast to generate it
[2:38:20] zachgamegodx: i don’t think hp is that bad now that they added mana costs to spenders , it’s like essences
[2:38:26] davidbleaja: wow insta pop😂 what healer should i make for a beginner?
[2:38:29] snakefizz: yeah making holy power spells cost mana as well is the problem
[2:38:32] Slayer_Eagleone: VENRUKI you can make a holy power bar in WEAKAURAS
[2:38:36] KralHor: or WOG should cost zero mana
[2:38:36] Slayer_Eagleone: or download it
[2:38:55] Slayer_Eagleone: theres a bunch of em
[2:39:04] BCboy_: blizzard killing melee wings was a bit sad
[2:39:05] Schnellmusic: omg it's Deadshart
[2:39:07] sch3ming: When I check personal resource display it shows absolutely nothing.... anyone know why?
[2:39:07] zachgamegodx: it’s good spenders cost mana, healing in low mana infinitely like hpal was doing was holding them back
[2:39:09] Vita51: spenders are so weak you can ignore holy power anyway kekw
[2:39:30] KralHor: PERMA CLONES INCOMIN
[2:39:51] zachgamegodx: ven reps Druids on cd.. he’s that guy
[2:39:54] zachgamegodx: badass
[2:40:03] wreklol: @zachgamegodx cap. that was a result of WOG being overtuned. now WOG heals for nothing, requires HP and mana. now that it does no healing it should only require HP
[2:40:11] Varaben: you know it’s the rat leagues when people play adaptation trinket
[2:40:27] zachgamegodx: @wreklol holy pally is doing great, they don’t need any buffs

[3:07:17] Omnadren: yea so basically when you cast Tyr it lasts for 20 sec, but you can increase that duration to a max of 40 sec by casting those 3 spells @venruki
[3:07:21] Mcaveryst: thats a 0-6 warlock angle
[3:07:24] dipicat: the mans chose death
[3:07:29] Ambersulfr: no one can, no one can.
[3:07:35] KralHor: "unhealable dmg"
[3:07:37] Ambersulfr: all you can give him is a q pop
[3:07:41] Ambersulfr: the rest is up to him
[3:07:44] anacronz: dont talk at this mmr ppl get titled :P
[3:07:48] wackpoetic: I usually just write something like "Resolve is a powerful defensive ability, try using it when you are taking high damage"
[3:07:54] Hizuru1: This looks like mercy just holding healing beam KEKW
[3:07:55] mrshowtyme: Pretty sure he is single target dottting

[3:09:54] swolegreekgod: what you hitting today gym?
[3:09:56] Omnadren: so basically when you cast Tyr it lasts for 20 sec, but you can increase that duration to a max of 40 sec by casting those 3 spells @venruki
[3:09:56] Hizuru1: @anacronz do normal 2s and 3s and add people to friend list simple as that
[3:10:02] Kalakbar: no discomfort, no expansion
[3:10:04] skez_live: the hardest thing about a fresh healer in shuffle is you lose games and its hard to tell if you sucked or if your team just didnt press their buttons
[3:10:06] Symo85: any 3s today?
[3:10:10] InfusionUS: Hpal 3s
[3:10:13] ooPickleRicKoo: @venruki play frost dk one shot people

[3:12:35] Redmanpig: have you ever been to Bret Hart’s house?

[3:17:04] yajirobeix: @Hizuru1 i mean the could do something close to ow, as healer u can kill players and also heal ur teammates
[3:17:11] ajohnson6236: i dont think that guy realizes who you are lol
[3:17:11] taylorperiod: you should tell him you're venruki, would probably make his day
[3:17:12] woossaahh: first season of true detective was probably one of the best seasons of any show ever made

[3:18:11] woossaahh: different strokes
[3:18:13] Hizuru1: @yajirobeix Current Overwatch 2 devs are total out of touch clowns who intentionally are killing Overwatch, and yes like that. Overwatch would had more players without any updates than now.
[3:18:15] snakefizz: why is that ele shaman even playing if he isn't botting?
[3:18:42] Juliio29: I’m not sure if you know but your healing is insane when you daybreak w/ 4pc
[3:18:48] wackpoetic: Hizuru1 I just started playing OW2 and I don't mind it, except Sombra. What's wrong with it?
[3:19:08] perosity: healing increase
[3:19:44] NJMcChillan: xenfuki enemy monk identity theft is not a joke jim
[3:20:07] Hizuru1: @wackpoetic it is not Overwatch 1, total downgrade in gameplay, reward structure, etc
[3:20:18] saamos: summer is pretty meh on bm since they're mainly pet damage

[3:25:42] JarJar_Brinkz: What?
[3:25:44] rekt1370: OMEGALUL
[3:25:53] goreleech: 5 minutes thats not worth - you will basically frostbite yourself
[3:26:02] goreleech: if 1 min
[3:26:04] goreleech: ok
[3:26:04] fairchildx: @venruki what price is it worth it ;p

[3:26:49] Borngood: Did you see how your Tyrs works with extending it, that’s a big part of the puzzle atm
[3:26:51] saitama_v2: bro i walked to my car when it was -25 and thought i died couldnt imagine -40

[3:27:41] absterge: wish you cared man
[3:27:43] Ambersulfr: statuette of unforeseen power
[3:27:43] nightmxz: It's crazy rdruids summon holy paladins off-gcd on a 20sec cd
[3:27:56] vinsbarcelona: WTF
[3:28:01] swolegreekgod: I'm pampered I've only experienced like 30s fahrenheit
[3:28:03] rekt1370: thats death boys
[3:28:04] ledpredatorx: if your car breaks down your fudged

[3:28:23] Badasti: i did ice winter swimmign in -24 and windy. -45 is nuts though
[3:28:49] ledpredatorx: im all for changing the weather scientifically to 69 degrees at all times
[3:28:51] goreleech: yeah you just heal stuff and it extends it up to 40 sec
[3:28:52] iplaygames989: even BC (LMD) is worst this week than it's been in a while. like -9
[3:28:55] thunderstud25: you need to make sure that the person you are casting on has the tyr buff in order to extend it
[3:28:56] tigerslap_ow: Im on sargeras
[3:28:57] goreleech: you are understanding correctly
[3:29:11] Borngood: Can flash early in game before cc to extend it before you go
[3:29:12] goreleech: no secret
[3:29:12] JarJar_Brinkz: catJAM MX Unleashed memories
[3:29:17] arn_333: how is ven sitting here with this much cloth if it is -40?
[3:29:20] nightmxz: It's BiS if you use free flash heals to extend it so you save mana
[3:29:24] OhWevo: yo who was that lilwywy guy
[3:29:24] Ambersulfr: it’s something a lot of people don’t know about that’s all
[3:29:29] Ambersulfr: it’s not actually a secret
[3:29:32] thunderstud25: you could tyr into a holy light also just to get a decent stack so it doesn't fall off
[3:29:32] AaronBaughman: masking sure u get the 40 sec duration and dont miss out on value
[3:29:38] knadam13: cant you just spam holy shocks too?
[3:29:38] OhWevo: dude was goat'd
[3:29:55] rekt1370: KEKW
[3:29:56] tigerslap_ow: which server?

[3:30:00] rekt1370: buddy its free
[3:30:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: 8K gold EZ
[3:30:04] rekt1370: dont get scammed LUL
[3:30:11] thunderstud25: holy shocks alone don't boost it enough to maximize the extension
[3:30:15] sixthycent: if i were home id do it
[3:30:15] pepsiflex: public orders are free dude
[3:30:19] Badasti: i always put 250g in crafting order thing and get my item in like 15 min tops
[3:30:20] Ambersulfr: 500g for PvP recrafts, quality doesn’t matter
[3:30:22] gg_emu: lol 8k gold for that is insane
[3:30:23] rekt1370: you cant public order recrafts
[3:30:26] tigerslap_ow: I can if youre on sargeras
[3:30:30] Ambersulfr: that’s more than sufficient
[3:30:31] yepbeef: 31 raiders from yepbeef have joined! 
[3:30:33] pepsiflex: just make a new one, dont cost anything
[3:30:39] Chadww: my rogue can but he's on illidan
[3:30:40] skywalker_uk: skywalker_uk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:30:40] sixthycent: thing is people dont understand a recraft still takes 5 mettle so some crafters charge more than others
[3:30:43] sixthycent: regardless of ilvl
[3:30:45] yepbeef: i need a dps for 2s
[3:30:55] yepbeef: oh hey venruki lets play 2s?
[3:30:59] tarth_100: lol holy paly time, eh?
[3:31:16] Borngood: Blessing of dawn boosts ur wog, when you holy shock/flash you get stacks of it
[3:31:18] Bullvaj: precog ring?
[3:31:22] tarth_100: Holy pally feels pretty good to play, hopefully you enjoy!
[3:31:36] Borngood: So weaving in word of glory becomes rotationally skillful
[3:31:39] rocka10388: What's the high crit low mast gem called?
[3:31:46] savotage_90: what ilvl should i be with pvp coming back? or last season blue fine to start with
[3:32:08] rekt1370: @savotage_90  use nothing from last season get full honor gear and start
[3:32:13] Borngood: You don’t really pay attention to it yet
[3:32:18] Borngood: It’s there tho
[3:32:29] perosity: yeah done 3 toons from green gear its pretty chill @savotage_90
[3:32:31] rocka10388: You've legit got the best coach in the game to get you there.
[3:32:39] yepbeef: always has banger play list
[3:32:39] snakefizz: rank 2 and 1 mats?
[3:32:39] savotage_90: thanks
[3:32:45] Bullvaj: ofc ur reaching 2k , ur really good at pvp :D
[3:32:53] joyrex_j9: its not if you want to keep the gem and the enchant
[3:32:55] kenosayd1: save a spark
[3:32:57] sixthycent: a recraft keeps your embellishment
[3:32:58] Gooseberries: You keep gem/enchant and its less mats
[3:33:00] sixthycent: and enchant and gem
[3:33:06] joyrex_j9: or say you have a belt that has the belt clasp, you can keep the clasp since it costs like 9k
[3:33:10] sixthycent: usees less mats even tho the rings are cheap
[3:33:10] tarth_100: you keep enchants and gems and embelishment if you recraft
[3:33:10] phanabananana: changing the stats on a item
[3:33:14] ZealotryTV: you need a spark for new crafts. recraft saves spark
[3:33:20] obamacantdrive: it's because all the pve'er think you want it at max rank but really it can be bronze tier and you dont care
[3:33:21] sixthycent: peopple charge for recrafts because the mettle
[3:33:21] Moobot: Latest video "We Tried The Most Broken Duo In PvP" view it here: youtu.be/wCEIaMfsDkQ
[3:33:33] chefkitchenslave: i crafted your ring, r5 :))
[3:34:06] snakefizz: does the missive quality and precog embellishment quality not matter?
[3:34:18] rekt1370: @snakefizz  yea they matter
[3:34:27] snakefizz: he used a rank 2 precog and rank 1 missive
[3:34:32] xoHOLLOW: @snakefizz not in pvp no
[3:34:37] thunderstud25: beacon will give you saved by the light
[3:34:45] xfeedgodx: mastery mayb
[3:34:49] Borngood: If you have the free global, usually after you freedom steed
[3:34:52] pragma90: i wish holy power auto regen like evoker essence
[3:34:54] Borngood: You swap beacon
[3:35:05] Phorians: @venruki Did you ever try body combat?
[3:35:13] joyrex_j9: is it divine toll before or after daybreak
[3:35:16] Denohar: he looks like a runescape character
[3:35:33] Phorians: @venruki Its like a mix of workout and martial arts
[3:35:42] Chadww: It doesn't matter, the only difference between a r1 missive and a r3 missive is how much crafting difficulty it adds to make it harder to max craft. Which for pvp doesn't matter
[3:35:53] Bullvaj: frost dk WutFace
[3:37:00] Symo85: is using judgement any good? he's barely using it.
[3:37:07] xoHOLLOW: @Borngood do you prio judement with procs at all?
[3:37:10] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy HappyPurgeDay_ WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[3:37:47] Iso6660: @Symo85 u can judge sometimes, but it'll take ur infusion proc if u do it during that, plus the mana cost is kinda high
[3:38:02] HappyPurgeDay_: HappyPurgeDay_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Here for my monthly contribution and to tell you I love you rukiLove
[3:38:04] yepbeef: LOL

[3:38:08] Phorians: derp
[3:38:11] 3KuLTV: yo ven whats a good healer to start learning pvp with?
[3:38:20] venruki: https://playactivate.com/
[3:38:27] dbmx1: Hey Ven i'd recommend divine tolling before daybreaking if you're playing illumination - helps with mana
[3:38:28] HappyPurgeDay_: Im well brother! just been on my grind (:
[3:38:54] HappyPurgeDay_: Ive been meaning to check that place out!! looks so fun
[3:40:29] snakefizz: this is the longest shuff ever

[3:40:49] lucasthebestx: Mies deliverance
[3:41:17] Phorians: Looks like playground for active adults! Like the idea but I dont think we have that here
[3:41:36] Qyzme: what da fuk is druid healing....people die with EVERY HOT up....
[3:41:57] snakefizz: druid worst healer in pvp rn /s
[3:42:10] timmah25: Give war Summer
[3:42:15] rocka10388: Ven learning hpal w/ commentary, and a good playlist is a great Sunday vibe.
[3:42:17] pragma90: you are in the wrong place if you are going to complain about druid healing
[3:42:23] Cripplesss: it feels like holy pala struggles big time with mana compared to the other healers
[3:42:38] 3KuLTV: whats a good healer to start out pvp with?
[3:42:45] KralHor: It does Indeed
[3:43:03] rekt1370: people say disc is a good starter healer
[3:43:15] 3KuLTV: i was thinking disc but wasnt too sure

[3:44:44] notSouki: ya but holy shock applies glimmer to your target, which can break cc
[3:44:53] perosity: i know last season i could almost solo dps with denounce and daybreaking holy shocks
[3:44:57] ledpredatorx: since pallies have little offensive capability they mainly want to stay 40 yards away alot
[3:45:01] Symo85: tell your teammates to kill observer
[3:45:03] Iso6660: infusion gives mana free flash of light, judgment prevents more damage, holy light grants hp
[3:45:04] perosity: not worth tho unless its a kill
[3:45:42] tarth_100: @Borngood do people still play hand of divinity?
[3:45:50] rekt1370: yea hand of divinity is good

[5:38:21] Omniax: holy light not the same m8
[5:38:25] Hizuru1: @thunderstud25 you win by making friends and do 2s,3s.
[5:38:28] Explicitx: who tf is reeceboss
[5:38:30] e10100111001: basically you want to use flash when you have infusions up, otherwise you will oom
[5:38:33] SpeedyMcD: Healing hunters is brutal
[5:38:39] TheBoyOnTheCouch: @Hizuru1 FACTS
[5:38:40] Borngood: Doing great bro
[5:38:43] notkoalars: buki mies
[5:38:46] e10100111001: you just oomed that round
[5:38:48] thunderstud25: you would only use it if you are using hand of divinity
[5:38:52] thunderstud25: which reece runs but not many pallies do
[5:38:55] e10100111001: the last, but ye
[5:38:56] TheBoyOnTheCouch: Holy light? Thats a PvE thing right? LUL
[5:39:00] flawfox: @alrajhio Ofc they know each other, but they aren’t really in contact
[5:39:09] Qyzme: well i dont know, from what he says its about to heal with flash of light as much as possible due to the way Barrier of Faith works with Tyrs Deliverance
[5:39:14] zachgamegodx: tbh, as lon g as vens top h eal isnt touch of light like alot of shuffle palas i see
[5:39:17] zachgamegodx: its good
[5:39:41] Texdizzle: replaces blessing of summer
[5:39:44] zachgamegodx: garbage passive i see
[5:39:50] zachgamegodx: as some pallies top 5heal
[5:39:52] zachgamegodx: its ur bottom
[5:39:54] TheBoyOnTheCouch: The healing rabbithole monkaS
[5:39:54] livetleves: Touch of light is a savior when ppl hit 30%
[5:39:57] livetleves: gives a shield
[5:39:57] zachgamegodx: so ur epic
[5:40:09] zachgamegodx: nah touch of light is a fluff passive
[5:40:11] alrajhio: @flawfox he looks like him
[5:40:13] zachgamegodx: in classtree
[5:40:22] Borngood: Ready for the rando stuff? Throw summer away every chance you get to bring your other blessings off cd faster aka starting room
[5:40:29] linalexlol: Hpally or rshaman better pvp?
[5:40:30] Badasti: does wings still cost holy power or did they revert that?
[5:40:32] Qyzme: well - doesnt pala play with Barrier of Faith nowadays?
[5:40:34] TheBoyOnTheCouch: Hpal is the only heal i enjoy playing honestly
[5:40:39] UziiB: i remember a month ago you didnt wanna try it
[5:40:42] buttercps: summer is like huge dam
[5:40:44] UziiB: hpal looks like so much fun
[5:40:52] TheBoyOnTheCouch: Summer is mid
[5:40:53] thunderstud25: its ok, its not SL blessing of summer
[5:41:07] Borngood: Yeah it’s been nerfed a few times
[5:41:09] Borngood: It’s bad
[5:41:17] Badasti: the change from wings costing mana to holy power is what turned me off of hpala
[5:41:25] Qyzme: @Borngood is barrier of faith bad?
[5:41:36] TheBoyOnTheCouch: @Qyzme PepeLaugh
[5:41:40] Borngood: I’d rather have the other blessings up earier
[5:41:45] Borngood: Earlier
[5:41:48] Borngood: You get cdr off the bat

[5:42:18] Kalakbar: monkaEyes
[5:43:10] Neztrous: @venruki  would you see the current meta is a caster meta ?
[5:43:11] TheBoyOnTheCouch: okay getting the Tyr extended! Big big!
[5:43:32] smitesucks: if bm hunter is a caster then yes
[5:44:06] smitesucks: dk also a caster so its giga caster meta
[5:44:27] Shezzmou: some casters are really good and at higher ranks it's more caster heavy but still a melee meta probs
[5:44:31] DoYouWannaHug: Caster and Rogue meta
[5:44:34] Badasti: @Neztrous only need to look at drustvar stats bro, this meta is dominated by melee XD
[5:44:48] flawfox: dh stun is dispellable so caster aswell @smitesucks
[5:45:07] Neztrous: @Badasti can you link me ?
[5:45:12] flawfox: rogue blind gets casted also
[5:45:12] e10100111001: you're oom!
[5:45:16] Badasti: @Shezzmou idk what stats you are looking at but I see the great wall of DK, followed by DH and Warrior before your first caster
[5:45:37] Pluckyz: ruki focus tea
[5:45:41] e10100111001: haha nice kiting though forreal

[5:46:02] Reiumi_: EZ
[5:46:03] bagofcans88: DH was thirsty for you
[5:46:19] blackheart1110: I would like to see Ven win wit them going on DH over boomy
[5:46:50] Badasti: @Neztrous google drustvar > leaderboard > stats > solo shuffle 2100+. ratings are deflated so not worth looking at 2400+
[5:47:11] SpeedyMcD: Bro what did you do to that dh he hates you lol
[5:47:28] Darnias: Fire mage is good in cata and you dont as much pve gear, are you gonna play?
[5:47:34] wreklol: @Badasti wait 2100 is high? brb gonna call my mom and celebrate
[5:48:07] Badasti: @Shezzmou its not more caster heavy at high rating though its consistent
[5:48:15] betterbeup: @wreklol 1800 In solo shuffle is top 25k of everyone
[5:48:32] betterbeup: @wreklol 11k healers, 14k dps at 1800+
[5:48:46] Badasti: @wreklol do you not understand how rating inflation works? Ven has been queuing into R1 healers at 1900
[5:48:47] healhut: wtf did he just blur lmao
[5:48:52] e10100111001: ven's just dialed
[5:49:21] wreklol: @Badasti i mean i don't queue a lot of shuffle. 3s for sure is deflated but felt like climbing in shuff was easyish
[5:49:31] TheBoyOnTheCouch: Have you tried hand of Divinity instead of Favor? I personally pref Divinity @venruki
[5:49:32] blackheart1110: you guys are losing for not going on the boomy
[5:49:35] bagofcans88: Shid
[5:49:40] 인터넷포트: ur dps players are trash
[5:49:41] blackheart1110: I don’t understand why that guy wanted DH over boomy
[5:49:45] NPBeharry: is green lizard about to take over the bracket on Tuesday
[5:49:58] ZeroOmegaLul: So why is Avenging Wrath: Might more widely used than Avenging Crusader? @venruki
[5:50:05] ZeroOmegaLul: Would you want the one min cd?
[5:50:06] chergaar: the ret has a 10/10 name tho
[5:50:12] brewtank: surely patch notes tomorrow Kappa
[5:50:12] TheBoyOnTheCouch: @인터넷포트 Solo shuffle peepoSad
[5:50:14] snakefizz: is there pvp tuning tomorrow?
[5:50:18] tarth_100: Its a holiday in the US tomorrow, no patch notes
[5:50:22] snakefizz: i couldnt believe the lack of pvp tuning in 10.2.5 notes
[5:50:47] wreklol: @snakefizz they don't have time. SOD tuning, Cata, new hardcore and war within
[5:50:51] wackpoetic: Patch Notes Tomorrow! Will be for SoD though
[5:51:16] snakefizz: @wreklol i know. pvp is very not a priority. it's sad
[5:51:54] wreklol: @snakefizz why would it be? there are more people on HC classic than actively play PVP
[5:51:56] SpeedyMcD: Kinda bs that rdruid just spams treants and it does all the work for them
[5:52:01] TheBoyOnTheCouch: @wreklol Sadly 75% of player base is PvE players. I do both, but wish PvP community were more active. Would play sooo much more
[5:52:15] snakefizz: @wreklol i am well aware.
[5:53:26] Bourbons86: never been 2400+ on dps before, floating around 2250-2270 on frost mage, any tips for dealing with hunter + shaman lobbies (i destroy melee lobbies but hunter + shaman just seems to always be sub 3 wins)?
[5:53:26] KushDaddy03: hpal is rough man
[5:53:42] ganjilicious: I think it's an uphill battle when you have ret on your team
[5:53:45] ganjilicious: cuz of forbearance
[5:53:47] Kalakbar: druids need treants to have like 10k hp
[5:53:51] skez_live: thats like every healer tbh
[5:53:52] healhut: yall overlapped a lot of cds at one
[5:53:53] pkutz7: you can do a nice hoj rep still especially on tree

[5:55:41] e10100111001: beat em dudel blind em
[5:55:46] skez_live: playing resto druids makes solo shuffle not as fun as a healer for sure lol
[5:56:02] healhut: full duration banner np SeemsGood
[5:56:09] SpeedyMcD: Why does cyclone not have a cd?
[5:56:25] Itankarenas: it looked like ur heals were just doing nothing
[5:56:34] skez_live: @SpeedyMcD yeah that would be pretty huge, clone being spammable is dumb
[5:56:35] rekt1370: you mean why is cyclone not dispelable in 2024
[5:56:38] bagofcans88: Damn I was ready to give up on you. Writing your obituary as we speak
[5:56:47] EliteDamit: 100% agree man
[5:56:55] 420blazeityoloswag4jesus: because druids a way overtuned
[5:57:01] EliteDamit: I try to stay positive but Druids make me miserable on the downlow
[5:57:24] willie_stroker_99: I never jerk-off on my druid
[5:57:25] endmyagony: Do they have anywhere any class changes for the patch?
[5:57:45] skez_live: @EliteDamit same, even to the point I tried to play one but it felt so dirty lol
[5:57:58] EliteDamit: @skez_live LUL LUL LUL
[5:58:11] rekt1370: need to shower after playing resto druid
[5:58:25] TheBoyOnTheCouch: 24 min queue, goes for a quick toilet break! Back to 24 min queue monkaLaugh
[5:58:30] bagofcans88: Do it for the light, Ven
[5:58:31] Kalakbar: meanwhile, people feel clean after playing DH pepeLaugh
