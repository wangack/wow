[0:27:22] gimilie: Bajheera!! My first time in prob 4 years love to see you are going strong!
[0:27:56] kyletalkss: Out of curiosity, do you prefer (visually speaking) being low body fat or the bulk bod?
[0:27:57] gabbledabbler89: @mutsu87 I neglected rear delts for years and started training them more frequently example at the end of back or pull day doing rear delt flys and even doing more of an upright row. I noticed huge gains. rear delts created a rounder larger look.
[0:28:34] Mutsu87: @gabbledabbler89 That is great! Good to know!!
[0:29:09] Time_Limits: LOL

[0:31:43] Time_Limits: losing weight is very very hard
[0:31:50] Time_Limits: when u are hungry and want to eat food x.x
[0:31:51] Time_Limits: jesus

[0:33:05] Mutsu87: I have those calf genetics though haha. They look huge with very little effort haha.
[0:33:21] kyletalkss: yea not pudgy
[0:33:36] Time_Limits: @SatisfiedStromboli that helped u when u are feeling hungry at night and stuff?
[0:33:38] truesin53: you playing sod ?

[0:34:47] simp4cheerios: @Bajheera how is fury vs arms in current pvp meta? been out for a few weeks
[0:35:02] SatisfiedStromboli: @Time_Limits maybe shift your eating schedule forward a bit so you're not starving at night?

[0:36:21] EjaVuDay: ill be the ret
[0:36:37] Mutsu87: One thing that I did this last year, to stave off hunger during the day, is to just drink more water to give me the feeling of being full. Not sure if honestly that has helped but mentally it keeps me away from snacking and possibly overeating.
[0:36:40] SatisfiedStromboli: Yo @Bajheera what speed do you walk on your treadmill?
[0:36:40] michaeleger: precog
[0:36:40] StreamElements: Yes, Bajheera IS indeed walking on a treadmill while gaming. The treadmill is Walking Pad, you can get it on Amazon here - https://baj.gg/treadmill

[0:37:48] SatisfiedStromboli: @Time_Limits then all i can say is drink more water like @Mutsu87 and @Bajheera have been saying. Seltzer water would help more though!
[0:38:13] SatisfiedStromboli: @Time_Limits they got tasty flavors like mango or cherry and stuff
[0:39:00] SatisfiedStromboli: LaCroix is the great*. Bubbly is pretty good too

[0:40:33] Time_Limits: but eating is the hardest part of losing weight
[0:40:46] Time_Limits: eating less that is enough that is filling
