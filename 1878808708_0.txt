[0:43:08] Sleepypan: there was the other week me included :P
[0:43:08] Sebleh: Siege of Boralus was the greatest BFA dungeon and you can't change my mind. You just pulled everything, let the bolstered spotter kill it, and immediately die to 138492342314780 bursting stacks. feenNo
[0:43:08] Oaties_: @stoneforge_ Waycrest manor was poggers too

[0:45:23] Sebleh: @ggDoA naguuraWeirdChamp
[0:45:26] HalberdWesker: @stoneforge_ Overall BfA had very fun M+, but Freehold stands out.
[0:45:32] DaBo00: @xqwl1 from my understanding, time/stars would only matter in a case of a score tie, and the keys are the same (I could be wrong)
[0:45:35] iamsteverose: I love how varied the comps are
[0:45:37] Sleepypan: @Entenei any i think
[0:45:39] htetgames: The devs have no idea how to balance the classes ?
[0:45:42] Sebleh: I wonder if blizzard forced everyone to run augmentation evoker on TGP to promote the new spec? Imagine handicapping yourself willingly and drag around a lizard that can't even outdps a healer!

[4:50:00] DaBo00: @Mokaod What I enjoyed a lot in MDI was that there were different comps for different dungeons, while now in TGP it's the same comp for all dungeons calebdThink l'm ofc not blaming the players, since this seems to be the best thing to do currently
[4:50:02] Mokaod: @blackbidone1 expected. I just swapped udk to avoker.

[5:07:03] Beave_86: mandatory doing the 28 instead of 29?
[5:07:05] TJKlaenn: @Chetroki If DW and FSY finish this and their next key, they are still in. Skyline would be out, cuz they cannot fit another key in after this one.
[5:07:21] falysae: Mandatory downgraded their key. 28 instead of 29

[5:07:42] xapluk: mandatory on +28 Vp meanwhile having a +27 timed on +2 ?
[5:07:51] XueAndDende: Kinda sad to see that an Eugmentation is even lower in dps than a Holy Paladin LUL
[5:07:51] worthtv: @xapluk 29 vp
[5:08:03] falysae: Yes. They must have thought that +29 was not doable
[5:08:05] worthtv: 29 vp looks extremely hard, so they're going for a "safe" timer
[5:08:11] Ravvq: are 1 chest timers equal across the dungeons?
[5:08:26] Gelatimentah: @XueAndDende its just a details situation, he's actually doing the same dps as the other 2
[5:08:34] blixten85: @hendryxe yeah they should go with only warriors and one rdruid
[5:08:37] evilcookie88: how long until the day is over?

[5:52:17] shiftfazed: no shot timing this
[5:52:19] Kezia20: It's nice of them to sell a boost in the middle of a tournament at least.
