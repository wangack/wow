[0:06:16] goplacidly56: Still not mount or dragon custom
[0:06:16] Xannah08: 21 toons a day, still no mount
[0:06:20] ramzie0: I got jebated by the Heartbreaker toy last night

[0:10:34] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:10:34] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:10:38] russtrotter: awww kinda had a nice soothing waterfall sound
[0:11:18] goplacidly56: this is a great xmog!
[0:11:46] cashthb: yo, they should make a downpour clock! instead of messing with the light it should sprinkle water at you
[0:12:01] cashthb: cold water!
[0:12:08] saga_no: saga_no subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Woohoo! :D
[0:12:08] Streamlabs: saga_no just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:12:39] heldtheline: You got this! *\o/*
[0:12:57] GreenArrowed: gonna try to get into some shuffle today
[0:13:18] saga_no: PvP-toon is now lvl22 ...decided to Chromie Time Shadowlands for funsies
[0:13:23] abadpriest: do you ever play with viewer for arena?
[0:14:05] saga_no: saga_no watched 10 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Might as well share this too
[0:15:35] saga_no: You did ;P
[0:15:59] saga_no: At least the Shadowlands storyline is streamline and pretty fast to just chonk through
[0:16:08] saga_no: fairly streamlined*
[0:17:17] honeybun_games: hello hello! happy sunday!
[0:18:31] natashaxt: what is ur fav expansion?
[0:18:51] averageteacup: Waiting for next expansion collect Shadowlands transmog
[0:19:07] saga_no: I've replayed it a couple of times now, and it's not the most exciting thing ever - but it's fast-ish, and once I get done with the storyline quests I can just do whatever sidequests I need to get to 60
[0:19:14] saga_no: or - if I get real spicy - dungeons and BGs
[0:19:39] honeybun_games: i'm doin alright, running some Love Is In The Air stuffs
[0:19:51] saga_no: Like - pick up all the dungeon quests while leveling through the story - and then just whip through those dungeons at the end when I still need a few levels (I'm assuming)
[0:19:59] averageteacup: I liked Cata and WoD, and i think WoD was a bad expansion, still enjoyed it
[0:20:28] honeybun_games: I wish I played during Pandaria, I would have LOVED it
[0:20:49] Delidragon: I find I get nostalgic about some expansions. I was not a fan of Argus at all at the time, but the other day, I thought it might be fun to try again. Will I  hate it again the next time? Who knows.
[0:20:56] SolsticeSipsGaming: did Druid healing take long to get comfy with? I main Holy pal and wabbs branch out
[0:21:17] Xannah08: WOD just felt unfinished
[0:21:30] Perkolate: i think ppl and the pvp gearing system made WoD fun for me personally
[0:21:41] kynlaeh: My faves were MoP and BFA
[0:21:46] averageteacup: @Xannah08 exactly
[0:21:49] vikutoru11: Good afternoon, Hazel! Happy Sunday! How are you? hazelWave
[0:21:52] kynlaeh: yeah i liked PVP specifically in WoD
[0:22:06] saga_no: I've only played WoD after the fact, and didn't mind it much - it's not my favorite expansion, but it's not my least favorite either
[0:22:20] GreenArrowed: i liked how gearing worked in bfa
[0:22:56] kynlaeh: i remember liking leveling and PVP in WoD
[0:23:04] saga_no: BfA is my Nostalgia Expac - because I started playing at the very end of BfA... but I sure don't miss the 120 lvl-cap... LUL
[0:23:39] saga_no: In that sense, Shadowlands is a bit of a nostalgia expac too, since that was the first expac I got to experience as it launched
[0:23:56] bustykrabb: i just got into healing this expansion and really found my grove with disc priest. gameplay feels super natural for me. i struggled a bit with resto druid n holy priest
[0:23:59] kynlaeh: i loved BFA zones but i hated alt levelling
[0:24:25] Delidragon: I will NEVER get nostalgic about proving grounds
[0:24:47] kynlaeh: i liked that azerite beam from the neck tho in M+ that thing slapped
[0:26:11] smashenater: hello Hazel and chat GunRun / . I started my ret paladin journey today - such a fun spec
[0:27:01] Bronloch: hazelWave
[0:27:03] GreenArrowed: ret pally is sooo much fun
[0:27:11] Kurama__95: Ret is the most popular spec in raids atm
[0:27:20] smashenater: I'm a fury war main so keep it simple is a must KEKW
[0:27:24] saga_no: Ret Pally is really fun - and I just appreciate having a self-heal button or two to help me stay alive ;P
[0:27:40] kynlaeh: i really like Ret bc the range of 20 yds on your abilities makes it easier to adjust as a caster
[0:27:42] Ryok: havoc is by far my favorite melee spec
[0:27:44] Bronloch: Paladin and Druid are the 2 most played classes no?
[0:28:04] saga_no: @Bronloch I would argue Hunter is up there too
[0:28:29] Bronloch: @saga_no i believe it was #3
[0:28:39] kynlaeh: but theme wise survival is a cool spec
[0:29:02] Bronloch: been a while since ive been to ironforge website
[0:29:28] saga_no: Of the three, hunter is the one I'm worst at by far, so I don't really play it that much
[0:30:05] Perkolate: i swear. its always warlocks
[0:30:08] saga_no: I'm OK at Ret, even though melee is awkward at times ...and I like boomkin (I main a boomie in Wrath Classic)
[0:30:19] cashthb: yes, let the salt flow trough you!
[0:30:20] ghostie1995: keeping the zen is very difficult
[0:30:20] jimmymidjinnilsson: I like playing with my Beast hunter. have played 240 days and started when dreanor came
[0:30:25] Bronloch: how is it possible to be worse at hunter than druid? LUL @saga_no
[0:30:37] saga_no: @Bronloch I'm just bad at it -  I don't know
[0:30:38] ghostie1995: but yes once i start feeling grumpy then i stop
[0:30:42] Bronloch: druid has so many buttons
[0:30:43] averageteacup: Recently healing in FFXIV, tank running away from me and i can't heal while moving ... but rezzed them and solved the whole mess :D
[0:30:52] Bronloch: fair enough
[0:30:52] russtrotter: i feel like we will start to converge where hazel just ignites in full sweat-lord mode calling some LOS-ing dps all the names in the twitch urban dictionary
[0:31:04] saga_no: @Bronloch I main Shadow Priest, though so I'm somewhat used to a few extra buttons / silly rotation
[0:31:32] saga_no: @Bronloch Classic/Wrath druid is a lot easier than Retail druid, I'll tell ya that ;P
[0:31:49] heldtheline: Everyone needs a bit of catharsis now and again.
[0:32:16] abadpriest: im trying to snipe these ques
[0:32:18] Bronloch: @saga_no agreed
[0:32:54] Bronloch: LUL
[0:33:10] Bronloch: screaming into the couch pillows
[0:33:22] GreenArrowed: queuing for dps shuffle means i can like. clean my apt.
[0:33:46] russtrotter: @GreenArrowed lol!
[0:34:16] Xannah08: thats exactly what i do!
[0:34:16] saga_no: Floordrobe. We all have one
[0:34:21] GreenArrowed: yaaaaay!
[0:34:24] GreenArrowed: they're so cozy
[0:34:57] kalithian2: good luck on your vicious mount hazel
[0:35:04] Dunedain1305: Hey Hazel! Hey everyone! 308 Hear-Shaped Box still no mount!
[0:35:34] Dunedain1305: This year only!
[0:35:50] GreenArrowed: we used to buy those hot packets that you break and put in your pockets
[0:35:57] saga_no: I used to sell things like that at my last job
[0:36:27] GreenArrowed: i used to knit hunting gloves for friends back home with little pockets in them to put heat packs in
[0:36:31] saga_no: Electric / heated vests, gloves, shoe inlay soles, etc
[0:36:52] kalithian2: does anyone know if the armor scroll for the proto drake is just as rare as the rocket?
[0:37:15] doublevkan: How is PVP in this expansion? It looks suuuuper challenging!
[0:37:17] saga_no: Kinda - yeah - though the gloves I had in stock at the store had heating wires going through them so the heat was more evenly distributed
[0:37:26] Xannah08: If i had to go hunting or fishing I bet my laptop would keep me warm
[0:37:30] totoroblack1: pokemon-go-to-the-polls
[0:38:21] cashthb: yo that skunk bit your but
[0:38:45] jgbrit: Hi Hazel! Guess what, Porcupette FINALLY dropped for me last night hazelShiny hazelShiny hazelShiny
[0:39:04] doublevkan: Thank you for answering my question! Appreciate it!
[0:39:26] Zuldak: i cant do pvp. it makes me as toxic as this love rocket not dropping
[0:39:29] jgbrit: Only 12 pet tamers per day, every day since November 😂
[0:39:31] cashthb: pvp in general feels better sicne the cc duration reduction
[0:40:14] Zuldak: there is still just so much loss of control in pvp from interrupts, stuns, disorients...
[0:40:16] maidhco: I feel like I haven't watched you in a while but last time I did you had short hair! It must have been foreer
[0:40:20] saga_no: I plan on rockin' the silliest mogs I can come up with....
[0:40:36] cashthb: if they'd only like double/triple healing spell mana costs df pvp would be great
[0:40:46] Zuldak: @saga_no ahh the BC fell out of the power ranger's closet sytle
[0:41:13] Zuldak: @cashthb and if matches started with 50% heal reduction and went up from there
[0:41:27] ahnn112: is today the mount?
[0:41:46] saga_no: @Zuldak I was thinking more awfully mismatched / the most clowny things I can find
[0:41:48] AmiYuy: @maidhco !wig
[0:41:49] GreenArrowed: when does self found start?
[0:41:59] saga_no: Gotta distract'em from my godawful playing somehow, right?
[0:42:15] GreenArrowed: @saga_no what class are you pvping with?
[0:42:23] cashthb: @zuldak nah, healers aren't *that* strong, I don't mind if they can pull back games... but they should get tired of pulling games
[0:42:40] saga_no: I'm leveling a Shadow Priest @GreenArrowed ...because that is what I'm most comfortable with - but I can always swap to Disco for extra clownery ;P
[0:43:20] diarrhea_lad: Bad news everyone, it finally happened. Someone insta-banned me because of my twitch name.
[0:43:21] saga_no: (And also because the stats are apparently mostly the same for both Shadow and Disco in PvP so I won't need a whole new armor-set if I swap)
[0:43:50] nyrhalahotep: Hazel is very much in the zone right now
[0:44:16] kalithian2: yeah i think she's got this
[0:44:33] maidhco: !wig
[0:44:33] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:44:39] kags158: Hazel I bought a pair of those wicked-good slippers and they ARE wicked good!
[0:44:39] Jaxameire: Jaxameire subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 34 month streak! Hey Hazel! How are you doing? Big smooches for Kira and Moose!
[0:44:39] Streamlabs: jaxameire just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:44:41] nyrhalahotep: concentration face is concentrating 🥰
[0:44:43] Xannah08: could be contagious
[0:44:51] nyrhalahotep: that's the most empty bags I think I have ever seen
[0:45:10] averageteacup: @diarrhea_lad yeah, it's a risk, why not join me, be the Tea Lad :D
[0:45:28] Xannah08: my bags are still full or halloween wands HypeDisguise
[0:45:36] Zuldak: @cashthb the thing is matches very rarely end before 50% dampening so really a match is just a lot of waiting around until the damening puts people in actual danger. Start at 50 to cut out the waiting
[0:45:51] GreenArrowed: i found anima in my bags yesterday
[0:45:58] nyrhalahotep: the hair looks beautimous
[0:46:20] nyrhalahotep: @GreenArrowed 😂😂😂😂
[0:47:07] cashthb: @Zuldak running out of mana reduces healingg done by 100%, atleast the players have controll over that
[0:47:20] Perkolate: and magetower old set
[0:47:50] cashthb: [Thunderfury, blesse blade of the windseeker]?
[0:48:11] kalithian2: speed set?  you mean movement for speed running mog farms?
[0:49:07] semideykevin: What game are you playing right now?
[0:49:12] saga_no: O.o
[0:50:01] semideykevin: What kind of games do you play without the playing mode on?
[0:50:35] furiforever: Hazel, I am late today but wanted to stop by and say thank you for the inspiration. I got my Moonbeast last night and this makes 3 seasons in a row i've shuffled my way to a mount. And this season I did it as a resto druid!!
[0:50:44] Perkolate: @furiforever congrats!
[0:51:03] majokq8: hiii good luck hazel
[0:51:13] semideykevin: What games do you play without the player mode on?
[0:51:24] abadox09: @furiforever Very nice. I'm still too scared to even try. I just feel like i'll get wrecked so quick.
[0:51:48] semideykevin: Hazel
[0:52:20] xqooq: dont stay in frost warlock !!!!!!
[0:52:27] furiforever: I did saeason 1 and 2 as a prevoker, doing it as resto druid was so much easier. And you will probably get wrecked until you get gear and learn but its fun none the less
[0:52:32] xqooq: front '
[0:52:53] kalithian2: does your rating go down at all when losing matches or no?
[0:52:53] GreenArrowed: shuffle queue also good for getting side hustle things done
[0:52:57] GreenArrowed: instead of cleaning...
[0:53:37] furiforever: I wanted to try shuffle on my ret pally but idk if i could go from healer que to dps que lol
[0:53:41] vampire_enthusiast: Question as someone who has played WoW for 5 years and never touched PvP, why is the strategy not to just bumrush the healer?
[0:53:50] GreenArrowed: my kitchen or the laundry for me
[0:54:06] abadox09: I will just need to muster up the courage. I will sooner or later. but it's encouraging watching Hazel, she's like, cool as a cucumber about it.
[0:54:17] GreenArrowed: @vampire_enthusiast healer has a lot of good cheat deaths and self pres and usually can't outheal focused damage
[0:54:27] furiforever: @vampire_enthusiast Healers are typically hard to kill, lots of defensives and the other DPS tend to protect you.
[0:54:27] jakefx1: if thats a sign, im down bad! haha
[0:54:38] kalithian2: nice save that rogue was close
[0:54:56] furiforever: @abadox09 Ya she is, and her tip to disable chat is a godsend
[0:54:58] GreenArrowed: chain cc healer then burn a dps down
[0:58:49] GreenArrowed: at all
[0:59:13] Shard477: I just whisper back “who are you?” and then ignore
[0:59:48] saga_no: Locking whispers is per character, correct?
[1:00:22] kynlaeh: i did a solo shuffle last night and i had that same DH tank you fought yesterday and there were several rounds i didnt even get 1 heal off
[1:01:15] Perkolate: I would take screenshots of the mssgs i would get back in the pvp days. would keep a folder.
[1:01:25] GreenArrowed: we're not shuffling to be social
[1:01:29] McScooterson: @Perkolate Not sure if motivation...
[1:01:46] saga_no: I was more wondering if I restrict whispers in any way on my PvP toon, it's ONLY on my PvP toon
[1:01:50] GreenArrowed: @Perkolate we have a discord channel just for flames
[1:02:01] saga_no: I don't mind the random entertainment from rando-whispers on my other toons - but I don't want them on the PvP toon
[1:02:05] MaddiDJ4: I’ve played this game since I was 4 years old, it only became a “social” game when I found a guild during sl, even then I hardly talk to them
[1:02:16] Zuldak: sorry you had the experiences that necessitated the addons
[1:02:24] kalithian2: makes sense because your a streamer you'd probably have people following you around all day other wise
[1:03:35] Daemavand: Greetings all! How is all :D
[1:03:42] Daemavand: apparently sleepy.
[1:03:44] smashenater: healer why you no do dis reeeee
[1:03:52] MaddiDJ4: Y’all remember archaeology? Eche’ro is up until the 26th if you don’t have it
[1:04:14] McScooterson: @MaddiDJ4 pepridge farm remembers
[1:04:15] GreenArrowed: how dare you be good at the game
[1:04:26] Daemavand: I believe the official term is, "Flabby Envy" :D
[1:05:03] Minobard: option 4 - ask them for tips and tricks to be on their level
[1:05:37] saga_no: I maintain that doing a random dungeon while leveling as Shadow Priest is the most bizarre thing ever... I'm on top of the damage meters for once (...I'll get put back in my place at the bottom in due time, don't worry)
[1:05:46] Daemavand: Definitely, because it depends on the emotions people experience when they see someone thats really talented. If they feel shame, for example, then the defensive mechanism comes up to prevent feeling that way, which involes tearing them down etc
[1:09:09] cashthb: have you tried not losing until you get the title?
[1:09:16] cashthb: it should work
[1:09:26] dreamwell_: Happy Sunday, Hazel! Thanks for answering my question last week about how you geared up for PvP. Your simple response was more informative than some guides I've come across lol -- I was able to get my restro druid completely geared (not including upgrading) in about 2 and 1/2 days!
[1:12:39] kalithian2: do people still win trade, or is that not a thing anymore?
[1:13:17] squishdotnet: pretty sure win trading is against tos
[1:13:29] Zuldak: so has moose completed his quest for the perfect stick or is he getting interested in other things on walks now?
[1:13:32] McScooterson: super against tos. also pretty hard to do in shuffle
[1:13:50] kalithian2: ah ok so its not a thing anymore, i've heard people used to do that all the time
[1:14:24] dreamwell_: what is win trading? o.O
[1:14:35] Zuldak: love sticks, eats paper. Confirmed: Beaver
[1:15:07] MaddiDJ4: I too enjoy a good stick. got so bored at work Friday that I threatened to start gnawing on tAble legs
[1:15:11] Zuldak: i dont know how you coudl win trade in SS since the queue is random. You would somehow have to luck in with your trader
[1:15:14] kalithian2: it means going against a specific team, get in touch with them, and they lose on purpose a few times so you easily get your mount, then you do the same for them so they get theirs
[1:15:53] dreamwell_: yeah, that sounds sketch
[1:16:04] dreamwell_: Sorry, I guess I hadn't heard the term before lol
[1:16:33] Zuldak: the goblin method of winning matches isnt against TOS: find a couple gladiators and have them carry you in 3s
[1:16:39] Zuldak: and pay them in gold
[1:17:18] dreamwell_: Goblin method lol
[1:17:37] Zuldak: as a little kid i would gnaw on table tops not the legs
[1:17:42] saga_no: I think that is why I figure I'd grind the mount in Solo Shuffle ...let everyone experience the clownery.
[1:18:11] GreenArrowed: oh
[1:18:16] GreenArrowed: shuffle is so much easier as a marks hunter
[1:18:18] GreenArrowed: holy
[1:18:34] kalithian2: the goblin method is give gold to a couple pro level players to carry it
[1:19:11] Zuldak: yep. Just like the goblin level of raiding is paying team liquid to kill the big baddie
[1:19:19] Zuldak: goblin method*
[1:19:35] mcccoy3402: Cheers
[1:20:26] dreamwell_: I think I tried once in Shadowlands to pay gold for a pvp carry and I just gave up.. I couldn't find those said people. I'd just get inundated with spam for paid services
[1:20:59] dreamwell_: I like to learn anyway :)
[1:21:28] squishdotnet: When are we going to see hazel in her archaeology era? I want some hazel podcasts while she does archy
[1:22:08] Zuldak: idk i guess it goes to the question is wow fun to play or fun to just get rewards in?
[1:22:28] Zuldak: cause it seems like a lot of the game is all about grinding out a reward and then NEVER touching the system again
[1:22:31] saga_no: Yeah - no - if I ever get carried in anything in this game, it's because friends take pity on me... and I hate it even then. I don't like not pulling my own weight in the content.
[1:22:48] dreamwell_: @Zuldak I think it's a little of both :\
[1:23:16] dreamwell_: @saga_no Exactly, I'm glad I gave up and never ended up buying one.. I enjoy the grind and learning experience
[1:23:27] Zuldak: yeah ive been in higher keys with people who had to have bought their rating and gear.
[1:23:27] bjarkanthepoet: really glad warcraft logs exists for that reason
[1:23:45] Daemavand: @saga_no The drive/desire for cosmetics is so strong and I can't wrap my head around it, as someone who feels the same way
[1:24:05] Kurama__95: I wouldn't pay for a boost myself, but I do boosts as a good source of gold. Hypocrite? Probably, but it's a good excuse to raid with alts with friends and get gold at the same time
[1:24:16] saga_no: @dreamwell_ Last year/season I lucked out and managed to grind my way from zero raiding experience to AOTC - wouldn't imagine paying for a carry
[1:24:31] dgriesemer: Does time walking raids count for the vault?
[1:24:38] Zuldak: i usually buy AOTC for the end of expansion mount. I just dont raid heroic
[1:24:51] Zuldak: @dgriesemer no
[1:25:11] dgriesemer: Ok. Thank you
[1:25:42] Kurama__95: @Zuldak Shouldn't they? Timewalking dungeons are giving vault options
[1:25:51] saga_no: When I say carry I mean like ... I'm in the raid group or dungeon group or whatever and do literally *nothing* to contribute
[1:26:12] saga_no: Me being terrible at dps and at the bottom of the meters despite trying my gosh darn hardest isn't really a carry, though some people would argue it is
[1:26:13] alisas92: fye43Ukulele
[1:26:36] Zuldak: @Kurama__95 idk if they should, i just know they don't currently
[1:26:45] saga_no: brb
[1:27:06] dgriesemer: I think it should count.  I just wasn't sure if it did
[1:27:07] quinnhasnousername: WOAH YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO CUTE!!
[1:27:14] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[1:27:14] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:27:50] quinnhasnousername: good taste in wigs haha
[1:28:17] ramzie0: What's required for the elite pvp set?
[1:28:21] MrSonicgen: Afternoon.
[1:28:44] goplacidly56: Wait til you see her pinkish one, so pretty
[1:29:25] Kaseyfullofjoy: the command for wig is hilarious XD
[1:29:50] RealDane: hi
[1:30:21] goplacidly56: sitting here saying get em get em get em lol
[1:30:30] ramzie0: Why does the round end after 1 kill and not when everyone is dead?
[1:30:49] RealDane: FeelsGoodMan GET THEM
[1:31:04] cashthb: make a bearform resto build!
[1:32:33] wolfcloudchaser80: Boy, today the internet has been uncooperative. I think it's probably my VPN, seems to be working much better with it off.
[1:33:41] fisherreads: so close!
[1:33:54] cashthb: wym he was a liver?
[1:34:00] cashthb: what if he's an alcoholic
[1:34:02] ramzie0: ah, ok, that makes sense
[1:34:41] ramzie0: Hmm... Do I buy the gold bug mount?
[1:36:08] saga_no: ....aaand back
[1:36:29] ramzie0: Ok, you convinced me, haha
[1:37:24] cashthb: I WISH eu had always on voice chat
[1:37:56] saga_no: I should probably get some food....
[1:38:04] saga_no: brb (again)
[1:40:51] cashthb: I'm kinda supprised how few cat polymorphs there are... Like good! that's my thing! but still
[1:42:30] retriol: shaman interrupts so good
[1:43:00] cashthb: it might be the easiest one to get, you just buy it in og dala for 2k gold
[1:43:39] retriol: yeah I don’t really like this map
[1:44:00] retriol: your team should keep track of where you are too lol
[1:45:10] Daemavand: Thats a great attitude to have <3
[1:46:01] furiforever: Off to raid, GL on your mount!! I will watch the VOD back later to see if you go it, have a good couple of days off!
[1:46:02] Xannah08: my Dad changed my gameplay by making my spells unclickable
[1:46:38] Daemavand: oh dear.
[1:47:10] gordastico: how is the pupper doing?
[1:47:17] cashthb: "classless, shame on you!"
[1:49:17] gordastico: like ocular high pressure?
[1:49:19] Daemavand: ...that sounds on par for exessive solo shuffle intake
[1:49:21] gordastico: I think thats what its called
[1:49:29] Daemavand: have you considered reducing your solo shuffle intake
[1:49:29] ellasky: the shuffling twitch
[1:49:35] Feornzx: you're unlocking your inner pvp
[1:49:39] retriol: I get the internal screaming from healing solo shuffle too
[1:49:42] Kurama__95: I get eye twitchs when I'm stressed out LUL
[1:49:55] russtrotter: i get that from too much chaining coffee a redbull and dietcokes.
[1:50:16] Daemavand: i get external screaming, personally
[1:50:32] Daemavand: jk I dont do solo shuffle :D
[1:50:34] McScooterson: keep a banana on hand for solo shuffle?
[1:50:49] Daemavand: external screaming is what occurs when i die to something dumb in M+ lol
[1:51:10] kynlaeh: i find solo shuffle way more stressful than other rated PVP and i think its cuz i heal and feel like its my fault if someone dies when it in fact is likely not
[1:51:24] Kurama__95: @Daemavand It's how I feel when I go warrior brain and charge right in front of a one-shot LUL
[1:52:00] Daemavand: @Kurama__95 LOL yep, followed by a string of four lettered words :D
[1:52:09] Xannah08: is that addon pronouncing penance like there is a T in it?
[1:53:20] Kurama__95: In my experience healers are very rarely to blame in keys, most of the time the ones who die just go "my bad", but one bad experience can cause you to doubt yourself as a healer
[1:53:32] saga_no: ....aaaand back
[1:53:35] cashthb: responsibility is for politicians and I'm too fit for that!
[1:53:38] Daemavand: I agree! That term is cognitive flexibility, which is being introspective about your actions and making an effort to change
[1:53:39] cashthb: like the attitude tho
[1:53:50] kynlaeh: @Xannah08  i think its saying penitence for the ultimate penitence CD that disc priests have now
[1:53:51] Daemavand: and is what correlates with rank in League of Legends, according to one study
[1:54:18] kynlaeh: @Xannah08  its the one where they fly in the sky and throw like 50 penances
[1:54:23] Xannah08: oh havent seen that spell
[1:54:34] dreamwell_: Oof, just did a few rounds of 2's with a BM hunter.. it went really well the first few.. then the next few I couldn't keep him in my los/distance to save my life.. dude was all over the place
[1:54:39] gordastico: penitance sounds like a fancy way to say you're grounded
[1:54:48] Xannah08: is that a pvp talent only?
[1:55:17] kynlaeh: it is just in the normal talent tree for disc
[1:55:23] kynlaeh: towards the bottom left i believe
[1:55:43] Xannah08: cool i have never noticed a flying disc priest in raid
[1:55:57] Eirchi: A penitent man kneels before God.
[1:56:11] kynlaeh: also i lied apparently its only 25 penances not 50
[1:56:21] kynlaeh: still good tho
[1:57:51] cashthb: a normal penance channel is 4-5 too, it's not that much, also its pretty slow healing
[1:58:21] kynlaeh: it mainly hurts if its focusing 1 person and not healing, so in a 1v1 if theyre the only one left it really hurts. otherwise it spreads amongst everyone
[1:59:45] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have fun.
[1:59:55] smashenater: 2 better than one
[2:00:09] thatgeekishdude: ur hair is back!!
[2:00:16] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[2:00:16] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:00:23] kynlaeh: you can totally get it in the next hour if you win very fast lol
[2:00:34] kynlaeh: do the feral burst build lol
[2:00:39] thatgeekishdude: oh damn thats a good wig then
[2:01:21] kynlaeh: i find it hard to do dmg in sholo shuffle and much easier in normal arenas
[2:03:45] raulboi113: P
[2:05:21] kynlaeh: do you have the swift spectral tiger hazel?
[2:05:48] gordastico: oh that mount is gnarly how did you get it
[2:05:51] cashthb: do you have the honor level 500 pet Hazel?
[2:06:13] cashthb: motivational reminder
[2:09:03] saga_no: Honor is character specific or is it account wide?
[2:09:19] cupcakechaos013: hey hazel! hazelLurk how goes the shuffle
[2:09:28] cashthb: account wide
[2:09:36] saga_no: Looks like account wide - my PvP toon who has not yet done any PvP has honor level 4
[2:09:36] MaddiDJ4: I get it. my motivation is that I’m 9 mounts away from my next collection achievement
[2:10:28] Oakdarkness: i wonder if a higher mount collection ach will come next expansion
[2:11:06] jgbrit: Just walked in from work. How are you getting on with the Vicious grind?
[2:12:27] gordastico: chaos gulp LUL
[2:13:22] cashthb: warlocks are an unsung brainded class, well compared to the other casters
[2:13:37] Daemavand: I think that break was wise lol
[2:13:53] 7thSaga: jimblesJedi finally a chill Strum Lol
[2:14:08] Daemavand: @7thSaga Always :D
[2:14:36] 7thSaga: sorry been a crazy day i just got home plus im kinda drunk
[2:14:38] jgbrit: Battle Mender is going well though, not far now
[2:15:17] cashthb: bm moonwalk
[2:16:05] Daemavand: omg we can taste it!
[2:16:12] Daemavand: (it tastes like salt)
[2:16:17] 7thSaga: jimblesSleep simplyLurk
[2:16:28] Daemavand: LOL
[2:16:49] GreenArrowed: that stupid breath wall thing
[2:17:25] Daemavand: Yes I highly recommend extremity warmers!
[2:17:30] vharakh_17: also the talent where fire breath takes away hots from allies, unless preservation doesnt have it
[2:17:47] Daemavand: Often a big cup of tea is my go-to for me hands :D
[2:18:42] ahnn112: as a stand still and cast player pvp seems like a nightmare lol
[2:18:43] cashthb: did you say you have an m1 macbook air, they have no fans and they are made out of aluminium
[2:18:57] jawea: I’m a dk we always cold haha
[2:18:59] cashthb: sure, you'd have to drop stream quality, but who cares
[2:19:23] jgbrit: Oh I just thought, how's Miss Kira? Is she about?"
[2:22:28] fisherreads: I’ve not seen many evokers in pvp. that’s cool!
[2:23:26] cashthb: any1 got a lifehack for sore throat before I overdose myself with dorithricin & strepsils?
[2:23:30] saga_no: They could do half a percent for 1 round and 1% for 2 rounds flat - and it would still be faster
[2:24:56] saga_no: Yeh, my motivation is grinding out the mount bar X times - but seeing the rating go up is also a factor
[2:25:16] perfectdisaster25: @cashthb I've had a sore throat on and off the last few days.... keeping hydrated seems to be doing the trick
[2:25:32] Daemavand: Aye, hydration and rest
[2:25:43] Daemavand: fresh ginger + garlic "tea" helps too
[2:25:50] jgbrit: ICE CREAM 🥳🥳
[2:26:02] alycynde: ^
[2:26:04] Daemavand: damnit now I need ice cream :D
[2:26:11] Daemavand: despite it being snowy outside :D
[2:26:28] JimmyJosser: i'm eating homemade ice cream right now
[2:26:36] Oakdarkness: am i hearing photo snaps in here or in mine
[2:26:38] kalithian2: rest, hot tea with honey, cough drops
[2:26:43] Oakdarkness: game i mena
[2:27:19] Eirchi: I had strep throat when I was a kid and they gave me a pill the size of a golf ball to swallow.
[2:28:00] Oakdarkness: i have to figure out why mine does it in love rockets attempts
[2:28:16] Oakdarkness: i have 100's of snaps of me in there lol
[2:28:18] Daemavand: I LOVE zandalari paladins
[2:28:31] kalithian2: and plenty of water
[2:29:21] jawea: hazelVoid you rock this
[2:30:27] Daemavand: Im also tempted to main one for kicks for a season
[2:30:45] Daemavand: *aolmost
[2:30:55] GreenArrowed: i've only managed 3 dps shuffles this whole time. at least i got other work done.
[2:31:06] vharakh_17: shammy purge?
[2:31:09] fisherreads: do you have a favorite vicious mount you’ve earned?
[2:33:43] kynlaeh: i think the spider is pretty cool personally
[2:34:24] Eirchi: What does the fox say?
[2:34:28] Natalie_8272: I found the KSM mounts of this expansion quite a let down
[2:34:32] fisherreads: oooo. the fox is so nice
[2:34:49] kynlaeh: that croaker one is pretty cool too
[2:34:59] gordastico: cat :)
[2:35:09] Thunderbrew: Hi @HazelNuttyGames Will you play Cata Classic?
[2:35:14] GreenArrowed: aug wow
[2:35:17] kalithian2: kitty?  or feral druid?  LOL :)
[2:35:49] fisherreads: we have foxes where I live that I’ll see run through the backyard. I love watching them.
[2:36:08] kynlaeh: whats the addon that puts on the markers?
[2:36:11] cashthb: you can finish it this stream tho, and then next week you can stream mass effect!
[2:36:34] saga_no: Are there addons for your frames that will show you if you're LOS or not?
[2:36:38] Lynsae: I wish you could give people personal markers; ones only you can see
[2:36:50] Deathvayne: holy o.o
[2:36:54] wolfcloudchaser80: @fisherreads We've got gray foxes here that come by almost every night. They're adorable.
[2:36:56] kynlaeh: wait ive never gottehn them tho
[2:36:59] kynlaeh: thats weird
[2:37:11] saga_no: Cuz I imagine that would be somewhat helpful when the markers are wonky
[2:37:37] kynlaeh: oh yes i do have them on
[2:37:39] fisherreads: @wolfcloudchaser80 that’s amazing. I only see the typical red foxes here. and lots of deer of course.
[2:37:41] kynlaeh: ok that might be why
[2:38:10] cashthb: @saga_no nope afaik
[2:40:50] Daemavand: absolutely no rush
[2:40:51] Eirchi: Wednesday? That's like a month from now
[2:43:46] kalithian2: what was that?  honor rank up?
[2:46:39] cashthb: we should make a petiotion to triple mana costs in arena! let's changedotorg
[2:47:05] Thaxorin: doing all this PVP is for something?
[2:47:24] cashthb: you got level 104 like n hour ago
[2:52:04] Daemavand: That's what I have my Switch games for :D
[2:52:10] Eirchi: Just killin' time until the heat-death of the universe
[2:52:18] Daemavand: although I need a cozier chair/couch to curl up in to play them
[2:52:21] cashthb: why don't you play poe ruthless hc ssf instead
[2:52:27] Daemavand: I feel like this is essential to the Switch gaming experience
[2:53:30] cashthb: @Daemavand don't be so posh, embreace degeneracy, play from the bed
[2:53:48] Daemavand: @cashthb that is literally what I do now lol! but my back is feeling it
[2:54:07] Hawke_89: Hawke_89 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:54:07] Streamlabs: hawke_89 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:55:23] Daemavand: I am also considering the collection of additional pillows :D
[2:55:31] cashthb: if you got space in front of your bad you can do the old switcheroo, and play on your stomach with the switch on the ground
[2:55:35] Daemavand: Progress!!
[2:55:49] cashthb: aw, the no mass effect stream? :(
[2:55:53] Eirchi: Wednesday baking stream confirmed!
