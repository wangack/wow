[2:02:51] falldrgn: @mavericks312 It was a casual guild who wanted to clear mythic. world first or US top 100 or even 500 but the raid leader treated it as such.
[2:02:59] doomkry: yeah to be fair i havent seen many dks outside of blood recently @Towelliee
[2:03:16] Sollice: DK Battle Rez- Rez the soul of this person bringing them back to life at 90% health and damage for 60 seconds after which time they die

[2:09:20] szble: Yeah target frame old still

[5:20:38] LearnedSomething: yeah he wanted out of exclusivity

[5:20:46] razledazle1337: !key
[5:20:46] 91Niki: He did a "I need a break" like it was mental health related. And it was just a PR move. So shitty

[5:20:53] Choppsuuey: hell ya.. it's Over 9000
[5:20:57] LearnedSomething: twitch is dumb for demanding exclusivity from partners
[5:20:59] Manabucho: thats alot of sponsorship value if you think about it
[5:21:01] AlphasaurusRexx: no shot he can keep up with 3 different chats at once
[5:21:01] 91Niki: It was the way he did it
[5:21:03] NerdyTeK: he fishing for sponsors so he dont care about subs
[5:21:03] LearnedSomething: they caused this
[5:21:07] MaximumSerg: but he is getting shit over it with his twitter and how he went about it
[5:21:18] WhiteKnight74648: what @91Niki said
[5:21:21] Sollice: @shytam ? Why. That's pretty normal for every form of entertainment and most working situations in the world
[5:21:23] TotallyNotRaien: unfortunate last name
[5:21:29] Mecabeast: more than jake?
[5:21:29] Ariea_Whisper: People were losing their minds over “how” he did it
[5:21:41] Jarlan23: does he know why dr disrespect was banned
[5:21:53] 91Niki: Yeah it was fucking shitty
[5:21:56] Sollice: Suppoesdely there is a program to aggregate your chats so you arent looking at many different ones
[5:22:02] ObsidianHealer: Yeah
[5:22:03] MILESkg21: it was mad douchey
[5:22:06] MaximumSerg: he the ian rapoport of twitch
[5:22:12] Hybridwarhawk: Accurate take

[5:22:23] Murlock07: >< ofc he would
[5:22:32] 91Niki: There is SOOOOOO many ways to do a PR stunt. Don't bring fake mental health issues into it. Then you're a fucking turd
[5:22:44] LearnedSomething: Sollice what exactly are you comparing this to? because streaming is entertainment, and streamers are talent in show business, so are you trying to say actors should be exclusive to production companies??

[5:23:02] NerdyTeK: i dont know why ppl care so much what decisions he makes so much and judge em
[5:23:08] EmpathyLiveChat: People factor their wellbeing into professional decisions all the time
[5:23:23] LearnedSomething: I think people are blowing up the act
[5:23:29] MILESkg21: exactly
[5:23:31] LearnedSomething: it wasn't that credible to start with
[5:23:32] Evoca85: A lot of people are "assuming" shit
[5:23:40] Sollice: @shytam Actors sign multi picture deals with single studios all of the time. No compete contracts. Signing exclusivitiy deals isn't new
[5:23:53] Toojicle: I think that's a reach. Taking a break from streaming doesn't mean he has mental health issues
[5:24:01] Nixel_: it was in bad taste
[5:24:10] Toojicle: It generally does but I think a lot of it is just assuming
[5:24:13] LearnedSomething: Sollice it is when you are providing a public streaming platform tho
[5:24:13] Contendedlemon: he was live on camsoda

[5:24:17] Necrolyr: Watch him go live on chaturbate
[5:24:18] Wcvechten: chaturbate ninja POG
[5:24:22] LearnedSomething: other platforms don't do it
[5:24:24] NerdyTeK: if he streams on all platforms its better to show analytics to sponsors so he dont need to worry about twitch subs for revenue
[5:24:29] heatedblankit: heatedblankit subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months, currently on a 13 month streak! 
[5:24:30] 3dRes: It's Ninja. Anything that Ninja says will gain traction
[5:24:40] NerdyTeK: he said hes tired of fortnite
[5:24:40] TotallyNotRaien: im sure streaming was melting his brain
[5:24:49] Ironhide_Gaming: Who's Ninja?
[5:24:50] Mitune: think he will stream on pornhub monkaHmm
[5:24:50] LearnedSomething: the only lie he said was he didn't know when he'd be back streaming, when it was obvious he had a plan
[5:24:59] Brandonhipster: @NerdyTeK Dont think it matter for him he got that mixer money
[5:25:00] 91Niki: He could literally have done the "pretend" delete accounts thing, not said anything. Caused a "OMG WHAT HAPPENED TO NINJA". and then come back. Would have been much crazier and much more talk.
[5:25:02] Sollice: @shytam ? Every person who streams on Twitch signs a ToS. It's not public like you think it is.
[5:25:02] LearnedSomething: and honestly, people lie about their job all the time, it's not a big deal :)
[5:25:03] Djfarmville: being a public personality is def mentally taxing def
[5:25:13] Snabido: Probably the way he ended stream before tweet lead to the assumptions across
[5:25:18] NerdyTeK: @Brandonhipster money dont matter .... he likes to work
[5:25:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Streaming is a lot of pressure, I would imagine quite a few have issues with it long term
[5:25:21] LearnedSomething: Sollice the platform is public
[5:25:26] TigasLIVE: @Towelliee What do you predict for release date of dragonflight?
[5:25:31] LearnedSomething: Sollice as in, you don't need an account to watch
[5:25:34] moistdanglez: you dont need to go turn in, just select talents
[5:25:42] TheCliffyShow: So basically, people interpreted it in a way that allowed them to rage.
[5:25:44] panzmat: no need for turn in
[5:25:46] rbgdev: @towelliee you can spec now
[5:25:49] looney199725: the 28-29th ye i agree
[5:25:55] rbgdev: You don’t have to turn them in
[5:25:55] epikouros_kathigitis: @towelliee bear or prot warrior better so far in beta?
[5:25:55] looney199725: but he also said pre patch is 30th october
[5:25:56] Sollice: @shytam Who is talking about watching? You said twitch having exclusivity contracts. We are talking about streamers not watchers
[5:26:06] waaambulance_: blizzard has a mole Kappa

[5:26:08] LearnedSomething: I mentioned the platform being public
[5:26:10] Connectus: Yup, based on the leak I already said pre-patch PTR would be this or next week. The leak is correct, it will release november no doubt
[5:26:11] LearnedSomething: I was explaining myself
[5:26:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, that leaker has been incredibly accurate....I'm going with his calls until they are wrong
[5:26:17] LearnedSomething: you misunderstood
[5:26:20] rbgdev: @towelliee you can upgrade your dragon riding anywhere

[5:27:13] harpdarp: 5g flight path WTFF
[5:27:14] LearnedSomething: Sollice on case-by-case basis what you say makes perfect sense, but the general twitch partner contract sets it as a policy across the platform, and that's not something normal
[5:27:14] looney199725: he also leaked saying pre patch is october 30th
[5:27:15] NerdyTeK: can you use the netgun on dragons ?>
[5:27:15] Alaquane: used to do it all the time with druid / typhoon
[5:27:15] GamingDad77: handy during the racing events
[5:27:16] looney199725: or osmething
[5:27:38] Sollice: I didn't misunderstand. You stated one thing about exclusitivity for partners and i responded and then you started in with it being a public platform which has nothing to do with your original point of exclusiivity from partners

[5:29:22] hammertofall: is it not possible to customize the dragon on beta atm?
[5:29:22] EKS90_: @theHarpdarp yeah there is no mission table to get mega gold from. and they said they didnt wanna do the 300k-5million gold mounts anymore either, so might be small stuff like this to get away from the mega inflation
