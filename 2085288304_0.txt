[3:15:51] drfeltgood: @Pikabooirl Stone guy said it depends on if they are water stains or hard water stains. if just water stains, Mild detergent, water and a soft bristled brush is usually enough to remove them. If they are hard water stain they will have a white residue around the stain and to use baking soda or a granite cleaner poultice, spread a thick layer around the hard water stain. Cover it with plastic wrap and tape down. Allow it to dry for 24 hours and once dry, gently use your hands to rub off the dry
[3:15:53] randyman26: their CC was kinda insane though
[3:15:55] cloakzy: wrong chat my bad
[3:15:56] vertmac: its frost dk, this is as good as it gets

[6:19:19] Officialappletree: aye update sub count  pls
[6:19:21] Officialappletree: ur shorting us
[6:19:26] ShutrMcGavin: isn’t dispelling 1 button?
[6:19:31] PrototypeFurion: @eronglan I figured, but just in case
[6:19:32] jcool_actsafool: they got them 88 dispells cuz they had their pearl house, lololjk
[6:19:35] matt_caste: say they're using a dispell bot, they'll lose to all the melee cleaves
[6:19:40] SirBeaverTeeth: did we go through the changes?
[6:19:49] niuZIXIao: No wonder next expansion is called War within, men vs robots.
[6:19:50] uwu69xd: yeah
[6:19:53] SevareX: did you watch the supa vid of the DH bot? where it was trying to attack him through a wall?
[6:19:56] ShutrMcGavin: oh
[6:19:58] Undankable: the fact that you cant even report most botting is a little alarming
[6:20:04] Basrip: 1

[6:20:05] Officialappletree: my hpal insta dispells
[6:20:05] rogue_i95: observer

[6:20:11] Robofat: he just mouswheel arena123 dispel KEKW
[6:20:18] ShutrMcGavin: maybe they have it bound to a movement key
[6:20:21] turboer: get mosemilk in the call :D
[6:20:21] ssubmit: bro was playing guitar hero with his dispells @Pikabooirl
[6:20:25] oaysis: maybe he just has a good weak aura
[6:20:29] Doolz51: Unless they use Vuhdo or Healbot for heals and have it set to always decurse first (which is fried to begin with)
[6:20:29] drfeltgood: How long until the bot situation completely kills PvP?
[6:20:31] sourbutts: damn fool, youre on laaate, i just woke up, its 8am
[6:20:38] absytime: or using some addon like decursive
[6:20:41] Officialappletree: never 4-5
[6:20:43] healhut: just in bgs
[6:20:43] matt_caste: 90 is my minimum
[6:20:44] rogue_i95: dont even have that many in rbg
[6:20:47] orbiitz269: 88 dispels in a 30 min game maybe
[6:20:47] Djingozor: I barely do 5 XD
[6:20:48] phnx2k: i had 89
[6:20:48] golana77: I can't even count that high
[6:20:48] rxcxx_: Dude I dont have 88 dispels in raid for the whole night
[6:20:50] phnx2k: Kappa
[6:20:50] rxcxx_: :)
[6:20:51] killer9298: literally never
[6:20:51] moistydank: thats my min every game
[6:20:51] collectinho: if it takes 40 minutes yes
[6:20:51] Sonderx95: can you show the dispells? i was away
[6:20:51] drfeltgood: I had 107 dispells back in '88
[6:20:52] adamjlek: i usually get 89 im like that
[6:20:56] niuZIXIao: I barely have 1 dispel every match
[6:20:59] Doolz51: 88? never. way too low
[6:21:01] PrototypeFurion: Never and I main healed for 4 years
[6:21:03] runnnnnit: only vs shamans, cause to dispell shamans is not bad
[6:21:04] Ryso33: lol
[6:21:06] sourbutts: @drfeltgood youll be fine at 1300 rating dont worry
[6:21:06] gdkpgold: lmao the match is long done and they are still dispelling Pika
[6:21:07] niuZIXIao: why dispel when you can dmg
[6:21:07] absytime: I peak at about 30-40 in arena matches on disc, I feel that it is low
[6:21:08] ShutrMcGavin: can’t they spam it with a macro or something? whenever it’s off cd
[6:21:08] opacawc3: what happened? dispel script?
[6:21:10] Boossterr: are all these bots just a sign of how hard pvp is?
[6:21:13] Robofat: he just dispel party1-2 on spacebar or mousewheel and press it whole game
[6:21:13] runnnnnit: i wont dispell a warlock
[6:21:17] turboer: i press all my spels 89 times and the gg out
[6:21:22] orbiitz269: nah scripts are fucked
[6:21:26] uwu69xd: he played double dispel talent to do that too so not only is he botting but he has 2 dispels
[6:21:27] Rapcher: i realize it all the time especially in solo shuffle
[6:21:27] phnx2k: I want honorbuddy to come back
[6:21:30] phnx2k: He was my mate
[6:21:30] spoiked_: pika its ok we all start somewhere its ok if ur new
[6:21:31] matt_caste: LUL no i'm just as bad at the game as I think
[6:21:36] Producedbyryku: your up late
[6:21:42] drfeltgood: I swear to go I could be elite on most classes if it wasn't for the BOTS @Pikabooirl
[6:21:43] Prehuman: i gimp myself because i dont use macros lmfao
[6:21:45] runnnnnit: @Pikabooirl to dispell a shaman is ez
[6:21:45] sourbutts: as a frost mage main, the amount of people with avoid ray of frost scripts is way too high
[6:21:46] killer9298: i had it happenin constantly to my boomy at 1800 in solo shuffle
[6:21:54] Rapcher: but i also think, sometimes, it happens to often it that makes sense, when i see instant rops ontop of my DH or isntant stuns as soon as i dance
[6:22:03] Rapcher: like am i in my own head thinking this
[6:22:05] ashraf_ma: Bots are very unhealthy bc a casual wants to get into pvp , joins a bg and gets analed
[6:22:07] Dopaminex: how is the boochainz doing tn
[6:22:13] Rawrkibble: He thinks he is him
[6:22:15] sourbutts: @drfeltgood sure
[6:22:16] ShutrMcGavin: the dude has every button macroed to dispel lol
[6:22:19] Rapcher: yea
[6:22:20] ArdellanDH: I always tell people, keep in mind, the Marco system is a shell command prompt of the games internals. so anything done inside that , is utilizing the games mechanics. the Anti-Cheat system only detects the abnormal numbers that what the game mechanics are suppose to behave
[6:22:22] Boossterr: im a 2k player in my head at 1600 rating, makes sense to me
[6:22:25] bolddywow: fire mage kinda getting huge buffs

[6:23:55] DennisTried: that warrior is having no fun :D
[6:24:02] runnnnnit: ele shaman dispells mean nothing, ill dispell all day but i wont dispell a sp or a laff lock
[6:24:32] cheezypoofs1: no music :(
[6:25:00] ARGUABLEx: this priest has reapplied fort like 400 times

[6:27:51] atthun_dct: everytime i lose i blame it on someone cheating lol
[6:27:51] ArdellanDH: I always tell people, keep in mind, the Marco system is a shell command prompt of the games internals. so anything done inside that , is utilizing the games mechanics. the Anti-Cheat system only detects the abnormal numbers that what the game mechanics are suppose to behave
[6:27:52] FkPveNerds: all my losses are from cheaters
[6:27:54] runnnnnit: @pikaboo lets do the boochainz tinybonk 2s
[6:27:56] Djingozor: I mean have u seen the kids cranking 90s in fortnite nowaday?
[6:27:58] Boossterr: the problem with cheating is in order to notice it you have to already be good at the game
[6:27:59] cheezypoofs1: i have no doubt people are cheating
[6:28:03] moistydank: pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold
[6:28:06] Caszatic: @Pikabooirl did i play bad i was the priest?
[6:28:10] weowis: this is why im stuck on 1300.. only facing cheaters :(
[6:28:12] ounx: is this ele only stream?
[6:28:17] matt_caste: What i'm curious about with the botters the other night, what was the point in random bgs, no reward. just like a testing ground?
[6:28:19] Baconbitts: zoomers dont play wow guys
[6:28:30] uncannysword: show this priests dispells @Pikabooirl
[6:28:32] celeryjuicer: yeah that's 100% true, i used to play diablo 2 dueling and only top players can really know when someone is botting or not
[6:28:33] chaduvifa: how are people cheating now? haven't played in like 6 months
[6:28:41] Seidhora: how do cheats even work in WoW? Just scripts?

[6:28:59] Rapcher: yes
[6:29:01] matt_caste: maybe it was like a test drive, 5 bot sellers, 5 buyers, first taste is free
[6:29:03] rxcxx_: Pika, theres a youtube video of the rogue bot and how they work. It's insane. Have you seen it? @Pikabooirl

[6:36:45] Regime_Enigma: all games should go the valorant strat and just have the anticheat rooted deep in your pc
[6:36:46] Tmbojangles100: like when that dude opened with disarm
[6:36:50] rxcxx_: You dont deal with it. The fact is Blizz doesnt deal with it, its not financially lucrative for them to deal with that.  You learn to accept it and move on, sadge
[6:36:51] Sojourner42: when someone tracks you through walls in an FPS without any sort of wall vision, it's kind of a hint

[6:37:16] terpsnpurps: why not 3rd party anti cheat software that loads with wow
[6:37:32] tuanqtx: @drreww OH they will ban them 40000, now they have to repurchase wow again......... that = more money
[6:37:34] Jenkinny: I think DH got nerfed as a way of dealing with the cheating instead of actually doing something

[6:45:52] SheeshTV: fraud, there’s no way they can’t take that back
[6:45:53] knadam13: @armoryme is a joke bruh
[6:45:54] tReynnoX: Good Morning Pika :)

[6:46:30] PrototypeFurion: @ashraf_ma I'm pretty bad, and only have like 4 pvp pieces
[6:46:36] spoiked_: who was cheating in the awc
[6:46:42] PrototypeFurion: @ashraf_ma I'm great at pvp, but no experience I'm pvl
[6:46:44] PrototypeFurion: Pvp

[6:47:07] sourbutts: 0 gratification in cheating
[6:47:10] Raff_Classic: they wanna get an edge and win or they just suck
[6:47:12] bonfeefee: how are they cheating? kick bots?
[6:47:12] focused_stumbling: Surely Blizz should have advisors or tools to help catch that shit
[6:47:14] LucianTheLyc: LucianTheLyc subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[6:47:14] orbiitz269: dispel and kick scripts are just gross and so are the people that use them
[6:47:24] knadam13: yeah if you haven’t reached 1600 on demon hunter, then you wouldn’t understand the mechanics of cheating
[6:47:24] Matzefyr: I cheat because it's more fun and challenging this way (I can play way higher rating) it doesnt hurt anyone else, so dont see why people all time cry in my whispers? ^^
[6:47:26] Jangoman: cause winning is better then loosing
[6:47:29] Ryso33: yea idk.. for data otherwise
[6:47:33] rkandr3w: for the clout
[6:47:36] PrototypeFurion: @ashraf_ma imngreat at pve. But no experience in arenas.
[6:47:39] sourbutts: people's ego's just cant deal with losing
[6:47:40] Regime_Enigma: ego
[6:47:41] Tmbojangles100: its gotta be one of the top players
[6:47:41] rexxarhero4: @Matzefyr hope thats a copy pasta
[6:47:42] Artiah12: wooooh here she comes
[6:47:42] eceria: I don't use cheats - that's why I never get 2100
[6:47:45] Artiah12: she's a man eatterrr
[6:47:51] rxcxx_: Peoples' egos are attached to their favourite games, unfortunately. It's why people cheat. They think theyre creating value ifor themselves, they aren't though
[6:47:52] trafatti85: theyre shit people who think that ruining peoples time is fun
[6:47:53] darth__necrosis: 95% of CoDtent creators absolutely cheat so honestly im not surprised if its gonna start happening to WoW
[6:47:53] trollmasta66: I had a frost DK bot today, first ever frost dk bot ahaha... dudes bot broke last 2 rounds, was just spamming strangulate on my warrior, he was getting perfect kicks and cc the first 4 rounds until the last 2
[6:47:54] ashraf_ma: @PrototypeFurion what spec ?
[6:48:00] Artiah12: Bro if they want to cheat on WoW and they know how to code half decently
[6:48:02] drfeltgood: I went to a site when Carl was saying Jamie was boting and a lot of them are Russian.
[6:48:06] Artiah12: just make a viral roblox game and you're chill.

[6:48:10] PrototypeFurion: @ashraf_ma Ret pally with leggo
[6:48:13] gdkpgold: damn i went for breakfast and hes still on about it xD
[6:48:52] cheezypoofs1: probably the IT guys at gfuel. Forgge has more morals
[6:49:00] ashraf_ma: @PrototypeFurion 1500 is easy , if u're good at pve just learn the basics of arena & u'll hit it in no time , easiest imo would be solo shuffle or 2v2
[6:49:07] trollmasta66: YUUUUUUpp
[6:49:20] sourbutts: if its facts its facts
[6:49:23] gallosh: sup pika ur never up this late

[6:49:44] Raff_Classic: on wrath classic or vanilla?
[6:49:45] trollmasta66: It's not, part of chinese culture is win with what ever means, it's not a thing. Cheating is fine because you win.
[6:49:49] nosleeps21: damn state of wow that I did not know about at all bro
[6:49:54] trollmasta66: it's not racist
[6:49:55] gdkpgold: caught me

[6:50:19] shadofa: no anticheat thats how LUL
[6:50:20] PrototypeFurion: @ashraf_ma yeah, west coast
[6:50:25] opacawc3: what do you consider cheating
[6:50:28] relaywow: Fortnite got way worse now people have this thing called DMA now where you can cheat on another PC and your actual PC is legit so its unbannable another cat & mouse game for Epic Games
[6:50:31] Tmbojangles100: what happens is that they convince themselves they arent cheating
[6:50:32] drfeltgood: What kind of satisfaction in attaining something you didn't earn?
[6:50:33] armoryme: dekel?
[6:50:35] ssubmit: true
[6:50:36] Ryso33: what if some are running them to try n fill queues and play normally on other chars lol
[6:50:40] gdkpgold: i abuse bugs in classic wow to get bette parses
[6:50:42] Ryso33: thatd be weird
[6:50:47] focused_stumbling: Asmon on Defcon 1
[6:50:52] Skillcap: why the fuck would anyone cheat...

[6:51:16] nosleeps21: Mitch ?
[6:51:23] orbiitz269: people cheat cuz they suck at RL shit and need to win somehow
[6:51:25] Jangoman: I kinda do that when im cc'd tho
[6:51:27] knadam13: exactly LUL like they’re killing the game
[6:51:35] Jangoman: my fingers rage when im stun locked

[6:51:59] XxMiIIerxX: if ya cant beat em join em lol
[6:52:01] Matzefyr: Blizzard don't ban us, so I think it is allowed between the lines
[6:52:02] Twix3z: how can you cheat in wow pvp i have no idea
[6:52:03] Jenjiy0: lmao
[6:52:03] ashraf_ma: @PrototypeFurion i'm EU , u don't really need anyone tho , don't let that be a barrier , just get honor gear , watch a vid or two about the basics etc & jump in there. Solo shuffle will be overwhelming if u have no exp so warm up in skirms & jump in 2v2 w/ any healer from LFG
[6:52:03] beidll: u cant relate cause ur a fokin legend m8, mby some noobs also wanna get a win against good ppl eventho it was a cheated win
[6:52:05] focused_stumbling: @trollmasta66 Can't tell if you're serious lol

[6:52:49] checkemcharles: kalvish?
[6:52:53] trollmasta66: @focused_stumbling I mean, the macros are funny. When I first started watching wow I was so confused why their action bars were just the same spell icons, They are just all macros.
[6:52:54] Taykyn: no money to make for a casual person cheating
[6:53:03] Skillcap: its tied with their Ego....
[6:53:04] orbiitz269: yo @Pikabooirl who cheated at AWC

[6:53:43] hectopaskall: Look at the chess Karmik situation you can just call any one and every one out
[6:53:44] PrototypeFurion: @ashraf_ma do I have to meet any requirements before doing 2v2s?
[6:53:48] Jangoman: you don't even need to do that
[6:53:53] orbiitz269: i use my weiner to play.. literally why i can't be 2k
[6:53:55] drreww: one of the reasons i luv wow...is the different ways to press your binds vs someone else in pvp.. the opposite of having a computer do it for you..my brain hurts thinking about it
[6:53:55] Jangoman: open your control panel
[6:53:58] bonfeefee: LU

[6:54:27] lazyturtle0824: The one you guys got in trouble for deleted his when asked for them
[6:54:28] drfeltgood: That one big Classic player who got caught using the Auto Hotkey on his stream when he opened the AH
[6:54:35] backort: they shy
[6:54:35] Sojourner42: but then they'd have to be a real player
[6:54:37] takhsick: holy shit went to walgreens for snacks and youre still alive
[6:54:42] Nyzoh: yes people that cheat are liers
[6:54:45] Jangoman: @gdkpgold if they disabled that its because it triggered on Dh's movement...
[6:54:47] Skillcap: what even is auto hotkkey
[6:54:47] orbiitz269: proving a real player means having more than 30 GM's for the entire playerbase
[6:54:48] kevinblackwidow: REMOVE ADDONS

[6:54:50] focused_stumbling: the hell is Auto Hotkey?!

[6:56:23] tonyporker03: ayyyye pikka
[6:56:27] TheRealMiou: I mean, usually a stream flourishes more if the player is good right?? so having cheats could help grow ur stream and make u money no?
[6:56:29] Robofat: @Blindgervee its pointles in wow due to GCD
[6:56:32] xthemoose: did you move back home, or just taking time with fam?

[6:57:02] Raff_Classic: HUH
[6:57:02] orbiitz269: LOL
[6:57:08] TheRealMiou: oh 100% agree, but usually people also watch people that are good, even if they are not as entertaining as other streamers no?
[6:57:13] MojoZeus: O.o
[6:57:14] IAmFluba: real cheats aside, Addons are getting out of control, not flaming Mes, but his UI/Weakaura setup, basically plays the game for him
[6:57:15] Jangoman: Theres plenty of Pro players that are shit streamers and they're god teir gamers
[6:57:22] orbiitz269: i'm fuckin wheezing bro thank you
[6:57:30] knadam13: but that’s why you’re where you’re at and they’re probably dwelling in basements somewhere barely getting by
[6:57:35] Jangoman: @Pikabooirl get a hot tub and 2 hot tub grills
[6:57:46] Tmbojangles100: i dont understand how you play with your foot on the chair

[6:57:56] Justinky1: they should go to prison
[6:58:08] focused_stumbling: name and shame!

[6:58:17] takhsick: insightful of you tbh
[6:58:18] orbiitz269: you'd think they wouldn't allow personal shit in tourneys if there's active cheating
[6:58:21] tonyporker03: you listen to rebelution??
[6:58:27] alexander4470: in real sports they are doping its prop. the same
