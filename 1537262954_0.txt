[0:39:46] silodin: Right now in shadowlands there is a 50% experience buff active untill august 2nd i believe
[0:39:48] INKDBOSS138: Is this gonna be all we see?\
[0:39:53] HeadsUpJunkie: Was just curious if dragonflight will change the leveling up experience a lot
[0:39:59] silodin: now would be the best time to level a new char
[0:40:00] Mr_Pennywise_: HELP just sneezed 6 dam times
[0:40:08] HeadsUpJunkie: So perhaps starting when dragonflight is out would be better... dunno
[0:40:24] Nazz_1138: @IceCreamWithSalt Ice now is a good time to level, but not a great one to experience the content fully, if you want to get a character to 60 and ready for DF, its a good time, there is a +50% xp buff right now.
[0:40:25] silodin: @Mr_Pennywise_ 3 sneezes is good weather, you sir are the reason europe is burning as of late.
[0:40:38] Mr_Pennywise_: lol
[0:40:41] HeadsUpJunkie: @Nazz1138 Ah, cool, ty
[0:40:50] literally_human_garbage: @IceCreamWithSalt The pre-expansion patch (or Pre-Patch) is probably the best time to start

[0:41:13] temp3st98: @Mr_Pennywise_ my old teacher could sneeze up to 15 times in 2 minutes LUL
[0:41:14] silodin: @IceCreamWithSalt you can play for a month just to level up characters and familiarize with the game and come back when DF launches so you can go in not completly blind
[0:41:14] dwolters_the_zombieman: it depends but if you start in DF you can get to learn the new talents for people who been playing we got to relearn stuff. to me i think it might be good as for new player or returning player to start up or back up in DF right now you're not really missing anything right now
[0:41:25] Mr_Pennywise_: @temp3st98 O_o

[1:17:51] Sollice: LOL thats a wonderful bug
[1:18:35] 91Niki: @Sollice I technically also have better specs than him, but I have to lower my graphics a bit. You can still try fooling around with the graphics. But don't break anything in your house in the process :P

[1:47:37] mayonaes: They can shorten it by pruning the trash mobs in the dungeon
[1:47:42] Balkep: @DAN_I_E_L_ should change your nickname to Literal_Satan LULW
[1:47:44] athalon: 30 min dungeons would be nice imo

[1:48:21] strchsr: @Towelliee I did both the dungeons once but I was really tired when I did them, so I dozed off a few times in Neltharus - wouldn't mind doing it again once you're done with this dungeon if you haven't done it yet
[1:48:21] LilleM00: @Towelliee Do you think we will have enough to do in DF without the endless grinds? Don't get me wrong, i hat to have to do it and not wanting to do it, just worried we won't have enough content.

[1:48:59] king_julian_96: timer
[1:49:05] Motivess: I prefer there to be a variety, if they want to make longer dungeons shorter by making you only needing to do half then fine, but I dont want them making content with timers in mind
[1:49:10] theoriginalzinng: have you done any blood dk?
[1:49:28] JBonezey: Where do we stand on Bear in Alpha? better than Shadowlands?
[1:49:28] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[2:17:03] TheCliffyShow: Anyone else think this place looks like the evil lair of a villain from an 80's fantasy movie? Had to fix the punctuation mistake. It was bugging me.
[2:17:06] violentmeme: I'm assuming the lack of enemy abiliteis is because this is normal
[2:17:06] Texas_Mizfit: up the stairs
[2:17:11] Tashati_: Wait why do you have combo point looking stuff
[2:17:39] Gomace: Anybody know which caster feels the most like they're just pulling spells out of their ass? I played Balance in Legion, and it was my favorite fantasy, but after they changed full moon, I don't feel like the rotation is the same. Any suggestions?
[2:17:43] violentmeme: mobs seem very boring compared to the SL dungeons... again assuming this is because its' on normal
[2:18:18] TheCliffyShow: @Tashati_ Called essence. It's the evoker resource.
[2:18:38] Darkwarrior5: its convoke

[2:27:36] Mattsta: *on a wowhead post
[2:27:37] Kneckt: melted
[2:27:45] Zippaya: mount inc
[2:27:51] DiiscoViking: and its a rhino
[2:27:51] shrektard69: that died way too fast
[2:27:52] procyon_mfc: ya'll are overgeared or they need to buff health
[2:28:00] Robodope: the bug report button bugged out
[2:28:04] rapride: how do you feel about guardian?
[2:28:20] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols Having ability to get doom winds along with other legendary abilities will make the class so much fun to play
[2:28:23] Chiraakitteh: It probably isn‚Äôt final regarding damage, likely they just want to have mechanics tested
[2:28:39] George2001k: What‚Äôs the new continent called?
[2:28:50] ceranac23: mythic also have 1 ability more on bosses :)
[2:28:50] teatimetox: dragon isles lol

[2:29:03] PapaBerg: its when his shield goes up
[2:29:12] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols I was so excited for Evoker but Shaman in general looks nuts
[2:29:15] iamspacemanspiff: Fire!! Fire Everywhere
[2:29:23] andrejhmm: You get Gold Shield that protects you from her DMG.
[2:29:27] Sylhepnia: Can you continue casting while an evoker carries you?
[2:29:37] procyon_mfc: they gotta buff boss health lol
[2:29:42] Kryptslayer: are the drak pulling aggro or is the boss random targeting?
[2:29:47] souplordtv: @SeckSymbols doom winds + witch doctor is an insane combo
[2:29:51] thatsmybis: that was...unimpress
[2:29:52] Embratorr: They not gonna change the UnitFrames ?
[2:29:58] KingSpud91: looked lik2
[2:30:00] Rabiahtaro132: Undertuned dungeon?
[2:30:01] SeckSymbols: @procyon_mfc This is just testing for mechanics, this isnt testing for difficulty
[2:30:01] KingSpud91: like 2*
[2:30:15] shrektard69: these need big buffs
[2:30:16] kingjudethe1st: uldaman again
[2:30:18] thelichking24: The Mechanics seems a bit like hakkar from De Other Side
[2:30:20] Scoodles91: can you share the logs
[2:30:25] Zippaya: it may be tuned more
[2:30:28] btdubs1: what do you think of the new Blizzard bars set up?  Is it the end of Bartender?

[2:30:28] thelichking24: Also has shield and pool
[2:30:30] m9minus1: and this is coming out this year LUL
[2:30:33] Angxlic: if you go to uldaman entrance you can do it on heroic
[2:30:34] Robodope: maybe they're testing like different scaling ranges
[2:30:35] procyon_mfc: @SeckSymbols I get that, but bosses need to live long enough to test mechanics
[2:30:37] TheCliffyShow: Nice 80's bad guy evil lair vibes.
[2:30:41] Clicklesly: Are both of them supposed to be 70 normals?
[2:30:42] Towelliee: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/DG9ARFMqv7WH412m/
[2:30:43] Gezber: YEP log

[2:30:44] George2001k: Loot all that gold now
[2:30:48] George2001k: Loot
[2:30:50] shrektard69: @m9minus1 it just needs buffs to the boss health
[2:31:13] Foodisgewd: how bear tanking feeling in alpha?
[2:31:14] SeckSymbols: @m9minus1 Exactly, and no one cares about normal modes anyways, what matters will be mythic plus
[2:31:31] ceranac23: chat crying its to easy on normal will die every pack on +15 :)
[2:31:43] Triist0ne: moonfire pumpin
[2:31:47] Gezber: but it also gives crit

[2:32:06] moltenllord: only evokers
[2:32:09] sponx: @Rudric_Ice No, Evoker only
[2:32:22] Rudric_Ice: sad
[2:32:32] TweektheProphet: did it feel better holding threat with thrash or moon
[2:32:37] MrFaxman: it's almost like it's a new class that needs testing
[2:32:40] Fyeah: they will probably be able in the future but not for now
[2:32:48] brewgamingtv: does anyone have the log?
[2:32:48] andrejhmm: You need to split it in between the two dungeons, I think.
[2:32:55] Angxlic: go to the graph and drag it in the summary
[2:32:57] andrejhmm: YES
[2:33:06] Sylhepnia: Hey @Towelliee! Can you try if you continue casting while an evoker carries you or it stops?
[2:33:23] qvizteeen: are there new customizations for druids forms like bear and cat? i see u got horns on the bear haha

[2:44:44] kevdot87: Cat weaving clearly

[2:46:46] Feta_Cheez: BM looks more fun than MM right now for the alpha
[2:46:50] Traith13: Im praying MM is good.  BM is so boring
[2:47:01] kevdot87: Fire breathe spam pyre deep breathe repeat
[2:47:01] SeckSymbols: BM Fun? One button classes arent fun

[3:17:28] Mattsta: there's an alpha npc that will give you 50 points
[3:17:31] temp3st98: its like the artifact weapon you eventually get all of the traits @Towelliee

[3:18:38] LeeqWeed: What class you rolling in the expansion?
[3:18:42] Biorrwolf: How pumped are all the scalies out there?!

[3:19:04] ashnmsr: look at the circle thing towellie

[3:20:38] almostdps: higher skill is better quality
[3:20:40] Khakiduck: okay this is cool af I am sold on our new crafting system overlords
[3:20:45] CVB111: read the bonuses

[3:20:58] Korupcija_: hopefully they will sell those 50 points in shop
[3:21:05] szanilTV: @Towelliee Hi. I just checked out enhancement talents and I think they have a ludicrous single target burst potential with Ascendance.
[3:21:05] strike879: the point item is not consumed
[3:21:08] blossomcamm: will other professions have specs? this is cool
[3:21:21] luchion09: ooooo
[3:21:22] TheCliffyShow: @blossomcamm Yes
[3:21:22] Gezber: yea
[3:21:33] BlewGamingGroup: people are going to be chicken hawking the crafting tables to get those free skill ups

[3:21:40] JustMeSoxee: @Towelliee how does the sword look?
[3:21:45] ashnmsr: wth is primal chaos
[3:21:49] Mitune: Can you place a work order or fill one on the aplha? @Towelliee
[3:21:50] ashnmsr: it needs x95 primal chaos!
[3:21:50] Miketolo71: one of those specs prob cause that last one gave you swords and glavie
[3:21:53] Joefoshow15: what do they look like?
[3:22:01] MrTerkyMan: @blossomcamm i think all the main crafting ones will? And gathering ones have trees to improve amount gathered and like distance you can see them
[3:22:05] happybooger: ^
[3:22:11] Motivess: Look at those stats wow
[3:22:25] Motivess: we gonna be in mop territory?
[3:22:31] Mitune: I wish they would make fishing like Stardew fishing
[3:22:40] blossomcamm: @mrterkyman oh nice
[3:22:41] Joefoshow15: are you able to preview those weapons?
[3:22:46] bwoods79: The increase the stack size to 1000 but it looks like they increase the mats needed for items =\
[3:22:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's looking good
[3:22:54] J_MILES: love the tracking recipe
[3:22:56] mavericks312: yea i like it
[3:23:00] Sore1: im so glad theyre finally iterating on it
[3:23:00] mayonaes: hell ya
[3:23:00] Ojo4: The real question is where do we get the spec points and how often
[3:23:03] literally_human_garbage: that's very cool - i'm super excited to get into it
[3:23:03] lunchbox8669: like classic kinda with the specialties
[3:23:05] maldgoat: cant wait
[3:23:06] im_capy: the rebirth of wow and azeroth
[3:23:08] CYNIC308: only took 16 YEARS LUL
[3:23:09] Mystai: i still hate the dracthyr models though
[3:23:09] Youredoneson666: WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY!!
[3:23:10] happybooger: WoW  is starting to catch up
[3:23:11] KillForPancakes: Just make everything a skill tree and call it a day, worked for PoE
[3:23:12] Peacefreak1: its almost like its turning into a rpg
[3:23:16] TheCliffyShow: It only took them 18 years.
[3:23:17] flebbooo: Yeah i'm rly happy they giving some love to professions for once
[3:23:21] RagingPunk: how do you get profesions talents???
[3:23:21] Larc9783: They had to actually try now that FF14 is a competitor lol
[3:23:22] kokochris: I always wanted a really good improved crafting system
[3:23:24] GamingDad77: #makingcrafting great again
[3:23:25] andrejhmm: AND ALL IT TOOK WAS FORTHE COMPANY TO IMPLODE

[3:23:34] Mystai: swg crafting still best crafting
[3:23:34] straightupphat: @Mystai lol true. they look out of place
[3:23:38] Motivess: It is definitely exciting
[3:23:43] strchsr: @Towelliee This is kinda like GW2 crafting
[3:23:54] TheCliffyShow: It's gonna be fun until lazy fuckers start whining and Blizzard ruins it.
[3:23:54] zorantt: Can you learn the other trees in that tab? @Towelliee
[3:24:01] isseidahk: oooo squirrel :P
[3:24:02] akia03: the specialty tab i think its called
[3:24:05] Ojo4: Alchemy specializations are in this build too
[3:24:07] Felkurio: anvil mastery seems like general blacksmithing skill maybe
[3:24:16] Nevindaz: this will be the endgame for many.. cant wait POGGERS
[3:24:24] NufinTV: mats stack to 1000 now
[3:24:29] mayonaes: they stack to 2000 right
[3:24:36] teeq_010: how is pally healer with this new expansion ... i almost see no healers streaming or im just not seeing it :P
[3:24:38] Kneckt: i think they stack to like 2k now

[3:24:47] doomkry: so even mining ores will have quality for the ores? @Towelliee
[3:24:50] xhaven: I like this but still the legion profession system was great but remember that players still int like it
[3:24:56] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @towelliee So what have I missed I'm just waking up now, I hope that I haven't missed too much...
[3:24:58] GamingDad77: @doomkry yes
[3:25:07] Clicklesly: @teeq_010 There's no pala talents yet i think, most healers are trying out evokers anyway
[3:25:09] doomkry: thats interesting
[3:25:27] teeq_010: no pally yet damn that sucks
[3:25:35] DragonofWolves: Towelliee you got christmas lights going in your bags lol
[3:25:39] Tiebot87: @Towelliee  is this blizz lazy expac ? i mean they took DH and made it into a dragon
[3:25:39] andrejhmm: @teeq_010 They will only now start streaming because the had nothing to heal until now.
[3:25:42] teeq_010: i play druid and pally healer so i really wonder how it is atm :D
[3:25:56] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: DAMN THAT SUCKS I'M SORRY üòû
[3:25:59] DeanoTV: LUL
[3:25:59] zorantt: Do gathering professions have trees like that? Or just production professions? @Towelliee
[3:26:02] mayonaes: They have a combined bag now by default?
[3:26:04] teeq_010: but this druid tank looks fun aswell
[3:26:04] Syborc: @Tiebot87 what a weird statement
[3:26:06] mayonaes: nice
[3:26:09] im_n0t_jezus: its sick
[3:26:15] Biorrwolf: Yes, queen. Give us your sweet siren song üéµ
[3:26:18] im_n0t_jezus: thank G they worked on it
[3:26:23] Khakiduck: they tried in legion
[3:26:32] literally_human_garbage: I still keep mine up-to-date, but I haven't had fun with it since Legion
[3:26:33] xReadyAimMissx: morning, I just woke up what I miss? what's changing with professions? danP
[3:26:37] shark_bizzle: I only do crafting if it nets me something worthy
[3:26:47] DeanoTV: profession trees now
[3:26:49] TinyTusk: i think tbc was interesting it was like vanilla but specialized weapons
[3:26:49] Atrophose: True, Legion came so close
[3:26:58] almostdps: looks like it uses highest reagent
[3:26:59] lunchbox8669: i gave up on crafting when the gear was crap outside of normal dungeons, then i just started selling mats lol
[3:27:01] Khakiduck: ya 100% it lost its worth after the first week or 2
[3:27:01] Jack_the_Dipper: Shadowlands had some end gear crafting.... for a good price :p
[3:27:13] sh1asurprise: sh1asurprise subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[3:27:14] Aquadriel: i think crafting was good on shadowlands, it made it relevant all expansion... but it was too expensive for some players to actually get into it.
[3:27:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Crafting PvP sets is a good thing, helps people get into it
[3:27:17] dmune96: They had it right from the start, let end game drop recipes suitable for late game people can buy/craft
[3:27:22] shark_bizzle: In legion I just made flasks as a gold gen
[3:27:51] teeq_010: how does that sword looks like @Towelliee
[3:27:52] icerasta: what does it look like?
[3:28:01] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @towelliee Are you planning on doing more dungeons on other characters today?
[3:28:03] TheRavenGrave: i was thinking about how they have reagents drops in dungeons. Do you think that this will cut back on Bot farming and third party bots?
[3:28:06] Bayless_TV: cheers brother. hope you and the family have been well
[3:28:25] teeq_010: ohw nice recipes again
[3:28:25] almostdps: ooh the pvp gear is in
[3:28:27] Ishva: give yourself more points and put them in the anvil spec
[3:28:33] Youredoneson666: crafted pvp gear Pog
[3:28:40] Jack_the_Dipper: A player on a couple of NA servers made like 400m gold profit by crafting Shadow Lego's
[3:28:45] Zippaya: that one costs silver lol
[3:28:46] duffluv22: Soo many recipes
[3:28:46] bwoods79: Can't wait till they enable addons to see how broken they are
[3:28:54] Luxicake: @RavenRadioChaos wont the bots just do the dungeons?
[3:28:57] ObsidianHealer: You stopped at page 3 half way through
[3:29:05] Kneckt: page 3 halfway through
[3:29:13] mayonaes: Have you done any dungeons yet?
[3:29:35] nicolai_original: Pvp gear will be from crafting ?
[3:29:42] maldgoat: so its 270 for pve?
[3:29:56] Norbi33: why we can craft pvp gear.. this was good in wrath but idk..
[3:30:01] Motivess: wow, the stat creep is insane, 393 ilvl had 600 stam, 270 has much less
[3:30:10] zorantt: @Towelliee Do gathering professions have the same tree? Or is it just production professions?
[3:30:14] trollmasta66: so it's the warlords version? for pvp
[3:30:14] im_capy: turn on warmode, get a ilvl boost. Nice incentive for crafted gear
[3:30:15] Clawsonx: do you need previous training to start dragonflight professions
[3:30:26] Nevindaz: NODDERS
[3:30:28] Tamz_tv: no
[3:30:29] Wolfenhoof: Imagine they would ever arrive at the level of FF14 crafting and a housing system... that + Tauren and wow would be almost perfect !
[3:30:37] temp3st98: 270 is probably just a placeholder ilvl for pvp
[3:30:37] Arch0ntas777: @towelliee is that a 50% XP buff????  Moaaar alta inc!
[3:30:37] Youredoneson666: @Clawsonx doubt it
[3:30:41] Ohmslaw7: When would you honestly recommend a returning player to resub @towelliee
[3:30:41] mayonaes: It may be just for the Alpha but you can probably craft a low level pvp set before you can but the honor set
[3:30:51] TheRavenGrave: Well i was thinking that all the bots had to do was farm the dungeons but what if they put a cooldown on dungeons?
[3:31:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Player housing LUL
[3:31:08] desmo7: housing is pointless
[3:31:10] mrz_as: KEKW
[3:31:13] babyhulk: babyhulk subscribed with Prime. 
[3:31:14] happybooger: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[3:31:15] mavericks312: housing is DoA
[3:31:16] flebbooo: 10.3 for sure COPIUM
[3:31:17] ObsidianHealer: I dont care much for housing tbh
[3:31:20] kyr_slowbro: Guild housing would be the only thing i care about.
[3:31:23] SethLan: they should look into proffessions more than housing
[3:31:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ideally the game should have housing, other games have it, but who knows when
[3:31:25] MammothGB: would end up like class halls probably
[3:31:25] TinyTusk: i feel like housing it too little too late at this point
[3:31:29] Aquadriel: they shouldnt downgrade the game and make ff14 things
[3:31:29] MarquisLek: housing will be like pokemon secret bases
[3:31:30] Kneckt: page 3 halfway through
[3:31:30] TheCliffyShow: I never forget.
[3:31:30] Nevindaz: maybe just guildhouse?
[3:31:31] Megadisaster24: Garrison was Housing imo
[3:31:32] Pixidyr: wildstar housing best housing
[3:31:37] Luxicake: housing would be nice for more collectibles sort of thing
[3:31:39] neverbeenhip: it takes away from being in the same world together
[3:31:40] thatsmybis: i think housing is a terrible idea and blizz never do it honestly
[3:31:41] Kneckt: page 3 halfway thru
[3:31:41] Nevindaz: maybe just guildhouse? .. towCopium
[3:31:43] neverbeenhip: if we were in our own house
[3:31:44] Strayer_J: thats why they need to make it UNFORGETTABLE @Towelliee
[3:31:44] SpoofAvatar: it will cost a raid tier
[3:31:47] Mitune: Well Housing is a new expansion feature but yeah
[3:31:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: we are still owed a dance studio
[3:31:47] im_capy: People will just talk in discord and the housing would die out over time unless RP imo
[3:31:48] Nachozdood: bug them every day!
[3:31:48] hailsatan_667: guild housing might be cool - but individual? nahhh
[3:31:49] blossomcamm: depends on the player I think there are people in FFXIV that housing is their end game me including LUL
[3:31:49] P4RT1CLEM4N: What's so great about housing?
[3:31:50] zorantt: Still waiting for my dance studio Kappa
[3:31:52] xRykku: If they did housing it would probably be GW2 style and have it be instanced and guild housing
[3:31:55] LesterLinton: what is the point of housing?
[3:31:56] TheCliffyShow: I will never forget about housing. Like I will never forget about High Elves.
[3:31:58] Wolfenhoof: Well i don't, but crying for 2 years is even more useless. And FF14 don't got Tauren :/
[3:31:59] venom366: he knows Kapa
[3:32:00] racketpunch: I‚Äôd rather guild housing vs individual housing
[3:32:02] happybooger: SoulsoBreezy never forgets about player housing LUL
[3:32:02] edrocked: Wildstar housing was amazing
[3:32:02] Praetour: @HaxzorJimDuggan TRUE
[3:32:05] TheUnknowing: I just dont think housing is important
[3:32:17] mavericks312: if housing were to cost us a raid then its not worth it
[3:32:21] im_capy: Guild Halls over housing any day
[3:32:25] Velashen: It will happen. Bet that will be next expansion.
[3:32:28] SpoofAvatar: garrison should have turned into housing
[3:32:30] Nachozdood: Housing can be cool and a fun mini game
[3:32:38] Kyletyldesley: its an mmo there should be stuff for everyone house chads included
[3:32:38] Cabbageman007: Blizz said The don‚Äôt have the engine for housing
[3:32:38] Teknofear64: Building a house anywhere would be awesome!
[3:32:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah New World housing is alright, the storage is good
[3:32:41] watpuppy: Wildstar housing was the best housing ever in any mmo
[3:32:41] Hypertitan: housing is a huge casual system that can keep people busy
[3:32:42] andrejhmm: @Towelliee I think they are afraid that people will not go to Cities anymore.
[3:32:44] almostdps: if they make housing power related people will riot
[3:32:46] Megadisaster24: Garrison KEKW
[3:32:47] Akermay: unique rested buff being there perhaps
[3:32:47] SpoofAvatar: no on trophies
[3:32:47] im_capy: New World meh...
[3:32:52] Nevindaz: but you need to water the plants to gathering the herbs for your alchemy daily Kappa
[3:32:52] notColt45: I wonder how many actually participate in housing
[3:32:53] temp3st98: if they add housing just make it how it is in ffxiv, a house require alot of gold to get
[3:32:57] BadCarma89: dont think so. they already said it would be a big expansion feature. thats why its always coming up, when new expansion gets announced
[3:33:01] ObsidianHealer: KEKW
[3:33:02] Thoreya: lmfao
[3:33:04] DeanoTV: lmao KEKW
[3:33:05] Nevindaz: but you need to water the plants to gathering the herbs for your alchemy daily Kappa @Towelliee
[3:33:05] Jereico: I need that IRL
[3:33:06] SethLan: lol
[3:33:06] LesterLinton: hehehe
[3:33:07] Mattsta: lol
[3:33:07] Alienfromger: ppl forgot garrisons KEKW
[3:33:08] Nostoroth: rofl
[3:33:10] abracka_: also the fact that housing plots are shared and the best looking one is shown on display. don't do XIVs system
[3:33:11] andrejhmm: HAHAHAH
[3:33:13] Drengarth: lol
[3:33:15] MarquisLek: your house is a dungeon
[3:33:16] kokochris: Garrisons...
[3:33:16] happybooger: sounds like The Maw KEKW
[3:33:17] zorantt: House Power System coming! The HP grind Kappa
[3:33:18] drewetling: grass buff is that like weed
[3:33:19] Drengarth: nah
[3:33:24] blossomcamm: i love housing in mmos and it's a big part of endgame for us casuals :D
[3:33:24] dragothicx: if WoW ever does housing its going to be instanced, as WoW's phasing system is almost as if was made for it
[3:33:28] Praetour: No AH /mount/rested xp in house, problem solved
[3:33:29] racketpunch: Guild housing where your guild meets up prior to raids to get buffs
[3:33:31] SethLan: housing should have rested XP buff
[3:33:34] abracka_: new profession could be construction for housing
[3:33:35] TheCliffyShow: If people are always in their houses and never in cities then Blizzard did something wrong with their cities.
[3:33:37] StoicRng: housing districts in Main city's
[3:33:37] Atrophose: Don't add trade chat to houses
[3:33:37] KilledByAGinger97: wildstar had the best housing
[3:33:38] kokochris: I would love to see Guild halls, and the ability to visit other guild halls
[3:33:47] drewetling: hooves in da grass
[3:33:48] im_capy: gold sink, lose 10G every minute you in your house. Renters fee Kappa
[3:33:51] Norbi33: @Towelliee im late for the 2 new dungeon? or dident tested them yet?
[3:33:54] Kryptslayer: because players afking in a city is a good look for a game
[3:33:58] Hypertitan: they could do what new world did and have it in town and you still see people.  I would imagine that phasing tech is kinda hard to implement in wow but it's an idea maybe
[3:34:13] Velashen: @atrophose that would work perfectly.
[3:34:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'd be fine with it if they just copied New World housing
[3:34:28] SethLan: like outside ORG @Hypertitan  - I agree
[3:34:29] Sollice: @Stopnsmellmynutz never?
[3:34:36] Praetour: @Norbi33 bit late
[3:34:37] trollmasta66: or just incorporate housing with a main city.... no one wants to travel for 30 minutes between house and city
[3:34:39] temp3st98: I would love more things to do in wow that isnt raiding and improving my ilvl
[3:34:43] Wolfenhoof: @Hypertitan That was the kind they did in Everquest 2 even before WoW and it worked fine.
[3:34:43] Kneckt: page 3 halfway thru
[3:34:55] Sollice: You need me to tell you why he isnt going to play Rift?
[3:35:19] Bayless_TV: big brain moves
[3:35:20] Hypertitan: @SethLan they can rework org a little bit too...doesn't even necessarily need to be outside of org

[3:35:36] Thoreya: nomiiiiiiii lololol
[3:35:38] Korupcija_: KEKW
[3:35:38] DeanoTV: KEKW
[3:35:38] ObsidianHealer: KEKW
[3:35:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: He's on fire!
[3:35:44] Wolfenhoof: @Stopnsmellmynutz yea, but it WAS Kappa
[3:35:45] alex12645: LUL
[3:35:48] Sollice: DIS FUKN GAI
[3:35:54] flebbooo: Don't fuck wit Nomi EZ
[3:35:59] OviTheGray: keep Nomi away from new Teldrassil :)
[3:35:59] LufiXx: He even has the Title Firelord, doesnt he?
[3:36:00] Jack_the_Dipper: Puuuuurge!
[3:36:00] mavericks312: an giving the hand of sulfuras
[3:36:00] TheCliffyShow: Nomi just be hanging out on fire.
[3:36:01] Xehanort1986: All the food he burned elevated him to Firelord status
[3:36:05] Hypertitan: @Hypertitan right...but the impression I got from Ion when he talked about housing is wow's engine is far from optimal to build a housing system
[3:36:05] PolyxTV: who the f is nomi
[3:36:07] Praetour: They have a masterful technquie for hitting dead horses
[3:36:07] denflup: EZ money
[3:36:08] BigJoeChestnut: The real end boss
[3:36:15] Kneckt: 36
[3:36:16] Tamz_tv: 36
[3:36:18] abracka_: 36 i think
[3:36:18] ruhroraggy: 36
[3:36:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: They just said "big"
[3:36:19] BoezIRL: 36
[3:36:20] Bayless_TV: 36
[3:36:21] Mattsta: 34/36
[3:36:21] Kyletyldesley: hopefully its endless like eso craft bag
[3:36:22] Tamz_tv: stacks up to 1000
[3:36:23] luchion09: @Towelliee ANY NEW WEP ENCHANTS U NO OF FOR DF ?
[3:36:27] ruhroraggy: 36 but 1k stacks
[3:36:28] xRykku: 36 but things stack to 1000
[3:36:29] EKS90_: and the stacks are like 1000 instead of 200
[3:36:29] RageerPLZ: They increaseed the amount you can stack stuff
[3:36:31] Mecabeast: 40 slots with 1000 stacks?
[3:36:32] Sollice: They put stacks up to 1000?
[3:36:32] almostdps: all the reagents stack to 1k
[3:36:33] Kneckt: mats stack up to 1000 tho
[3:36:35] FrankTheTank1988: they increased stacks to 1k and 200 for pots tho
[3:36:37] Wolfenhoof: @Hypertitan WoW engine is far from optimal for pretty much anything, and yet they're doing stuff Kappa
[3:36:40] o00o0o0oo: "Re-ageant"
[3:36:42] TheCliffyShow: Nomi is probably yelling, "Why won't anyone put me out? Some of you can literally shoot water."
[3:36:42] ruhroraggy: you Trippin if you say its not enough xD
[3:36:43] Kyletyldesley: eso craft bag is god tire
[3:36:46] andrejhmm: @Towelliee One slot can hold 1000 reagents
[3:36:46] mrz_as: it stacks to 1000
[3:36:47] TweektheProphet: but you will drop alot of that in the bank
[3:36:48] duffluv22: The Horde side needs an Hogger type boss
[3:36:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: The ESO crafting bag is badass, but they weren't talking about infinite
[3:36:50] HaloS23: how long has the player DK voice been broken?
[3:36:51] sh1asurprise: I imagine there are gonna be different sizes crafted like regular bads right?
[3:36:51] Kyletyldesley: tier* xD
[3:36:52] im_capy: Rift peak player count last 30 days....248 LUL
[3:36:53] Afrostump: bag that holds 36000 herbs "isnt enough"?
[3:36:55] Tamz_tv: @Sollice stacks of most reagents up to 1000, stacks of consumables up to 200
[3:36:55] Nevindaz: yea like a void bag
[3:36:59] strchsr: @Towelliee bro there's a cooking recipe called CHEESE AND QUACKERS I am dead
[3:37:02] Larc9783: Just make it a collection page that you can fill up to a max of every crafting item in teh game
[3:37:04] Melt69: better then nothing ..I surprised they don't do a premium sub like eso for the bag
[3:37:05] Zwarx32: @ruhroraggy he didn‚Äôt read the rest of the comment abt the 1k stacks
[3:37:06] xReadyAimMissx: knowing how I loot whatevers not nailed down. no bag exists that's big enough for me. burkeKek
[3:37:07] bwoods79: I am still waiting on a storage place that can be accessed across all chars on same server
[3:37:08] Hypertitan: @Hypertitan true...it's just much more of an undertaking than other games haha
[3:37:09] Nevindaz: hold my bag
[3:37:10] Naturalbeef: Stacks of 1,000 will help
[3:37:21] TheCliffyShow: Great player housing system to.
[3:37:24] Kneckt: u can put 36000 in the reagant bag
[3:37:28] Motivess: wtf was that stamina?
[3:37:28] Velashen: Tailors will be making butt loads on reagent bags. SMOrc
[3:37:28] CYNIC308: crafting in ESO is mandatory if you wanna do endgame properly
[3:37:32] Sollice: Could you imagine some peoples bags if it was limitless......
[3:37:33] Motivess: 24,00?
[3:37:39] Motivess: 2,400*
[3:37:45] FresheFefe: atleast the code tastes good
[3:37:47] happybooger: yep
[3:37:51] Trifeca: Personally, I would love to see an adventurer house where all guilds and all people can take on different quests and have a pve ranking list for solos and guilds and then basically create a competition to see who is the best
[3:37:52] EKS90_: That is what they said.
[3:37:53] Alvari: do the new alpha builds add up on content or do they remove the earlier phases?
[3:37:56] hasan666: Spagetti is good
[3:37:56] ruhroraggy: no
[3:37:56] temp3st98: yes
[3:37:58] blossomcamm: yes
[3:37:58] Jalapinot: No
[3:37:59] Metalcalfe: no
[3:37:59] Frank4LuLz: yes
[3:37:59] FostBros: no
[3:38:00] Volatilestyle: no
[3:38:00] EKS90_: if you do enough time in them you could do everything.
[3:38:00] Gotxiko: yes
[3:38:00] mavericks312: i dont htink so
[3:38:01] Youredoneson666: no
[3:38:01] Tooshkit: no
[3:38:01] Cezzan: Yeah
[3:38:02] Aquadriel: Yes ofc
[3:38:02] rudericus: nope
[3:38:03] notColt45: No, unique
[3:38:03] childishj035: no, 2 max
[3:38:03] rusty414: no
[3:38:03] Mitune: maybe a couple but not all
[3:38:03] ashnmsr: No
[3:38:03] luchion09: NO
[3:38:04] Drengarth: unique
[3:38:04] Sufix: no
[3:38:05] Volatilestyle: should be special
[3:38:06] Dafinchi: nah, should be a meaningful choice
[3:38:06] kaeildk: no
[3:38:06] Kneckt: no
[3:38:06] Hypertitan: yes...but that should take a long fucking time
[3:38:07] happybooger: i want it all
[3:38:07] xReadyAimMissx: wait, so like New World? danP
[3:38:08] joe_g_433: Wait so we are going to get a separate mats bag? Like in additional to our current bag count?
[3:38:08] Motivess: No, make it unique and limited
[3:38:08] racketpunch: I‚Äôm a tailor. I want less bag space for that $$&
[3:38:08] ruhroraggy: you should have to be unique and go inot just one
[3:38:09] Jalapinot: No, then its not a "specialization"
[3:38:10] Kneckt: unique
[3:38:10] almostdps: as soon as its unique people bitch
[3:38:10] Reverez: i hope its uniqu
[3:38:10] BattleKnoedel: people would just use multiple chars
[3:38:11] ashnmsr: unique ofc
[3:38:12] Phoenixfiend: Unique
[3:38:14] izabeL: unique
[3:38:14] Tooshkit: there is a reason there are working orders for the ah
[3:38:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would be fine if you could specialize in it all, but I think they want meaningful choices
[3:38:17] rudericus: no one is specialised in everything
[3:38:17] Larc9783: Let me do everything so i don't have to do it on multiple characters per profesion
[3:38:17] Gotxiko: work your way to be the best in all, dont lock it
[3:38:18] Consensus_: kind of defeats the purpose of calling it specialty.
[3:38:18] zarenadt: remember when tailoring required from usbto travel to moonwells? good old times Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:38:18] croutomz: i think you should but it should be a significant time investment
[3:38:20] alantin77: yes if each profession doesn't make parts for the other professions
[3:38:21] Sufix: keep it unique
[3:38:21] Frank4LuLz: armour, weapons, trinkets, also librims
[3:38:21] PokerFaceMoose: add a poll?
[3:38:21] Akermay: I'd prefer being able to learn more professions, but only a single spec in each
[3:38:22] Jalapinot: If you can do everything, its not a specialty anymore
[3:38:23] PadidinJones: I mean that was classic no? Weaponsmithing and Armorsmithing
[3:38:23] Dagomarus: If everyone could do it its not specialising
[3:38:24] xhaven: I think that would b a major grind
[3:38:25] sh1asurprise: not everything, otherwise at the end of expac the entire system is wasted
[3:38:25] Jereico: I like the idea of it being unique, but this stuff always gets weird on small servers
[3:38:26] Youredoneson666: should be unique
[3:38:31] shark_bizzle: more is better
[3:38:32] Sollice: Maybe deep in to the expansion they can unlock a second mastery
[3:38:33] HaloS23: Max out in 1 but 1 teir shy i nthe rest
[3:38:33] Aquadriel: @Towelliee You should be able to do everything, makes the system last longer rather than stop you at one thing.
[3:38:33] MuddyMcGir: I like that idea, buuuut. A real person could be a master craftsperson at all those things if they really wanted.
[3:38:38] TinyTusk: it should be unique, hell add a ranking system where the top 3 gets like 1% more stats on gear  make it fun for crafters
[3:38:39] notColt45: Professions ARE a grind
[3:38:41] mavericks312: if everyone could make everything then why have specializations
[3:38:42] EKS90_: they said a long time.
[3:38:43] o00o0o0oo: rmbr when league came from wow
[3:38:43] Gotxiko: though the work order system allows for not being able to craft some things
[3:38:46] luchion09: 1 MILLLLIONS YEEEARS LOL
[3:38:46] TweektheProphet: if there is somewhere i can see how many of what specialty exist on my server i am find with single specilties
[3:38:50] LufiXx: it is a game within the game
[3:38:53] JBonezey: Artisan Points?
[3:38:57] racketpunch: Only one specialty. It would make it harder to make gold in the AH.
[3:38:57] im_capy: professions will have a lifespan for the entire expansion, in most cases we max it out before the first patch
[3:38:57] bwoods79: Player housing with storage that is accessible by all chars on that server
[3:39:03] Wolfenhoof: it will also be timegated, my guess is that you can  have it all after the first year
[3:39:03] JBonezey: Artisan Points (AP) Grind?
[3:39:03] Mattsta: Ion in one of the first set of interviews said there isn't a cap...and that by end of xpac ppl could be specialized in everything
[3:39:04] Sollice: @tano_cosplay You put in work orders for things and people fill them
[3:39:10] KingSlayerYotam: Wasn't the point in having less restrictions?
[3:39:10] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:39:10] Kisswani: 5
[3:39:13] almostdps: do we even know how you get points?
[3:39:13] Sollice: So you dont really need to know "who is the best"
[3:39:14] Jalapinot: I hope they only let you have 1 specialty. If you can have all of them, its not a "specialty" anymore
[3:39:24] Kisswani: 8100
[3:39:24] Gotxiko: it really doesn't matter in the end if you can't specialize in all, work order system already allows you to farm mats and craft stuff
[3:39:25] Kneckt: 810
[3:39:26] ExtreemeCheese: 810
[3:39:28] Praetour: 840
[3:39:29] isseidahk: 870?
[3:39:30] Kisswani: 810
[3:39:31] lunchbox8669: 810
[3:39:32] Hypertitan: speccing into one shouldn't be a HUGE grind...but going into other's should progressively take longer
[3:39:33] Cezzan: 910
[3:39:36] Manabucho: looks dope though, might actually make me stick through the expansion
[3:39:37] Cezzan: 810*
[3:39:38] TweektheProphet: @tano_cosplay yeah but if i am grinding a specilty i would want to know what is more rare ion my server
[3:39:39] almostdps: how do you get points?
[3:39:42] Aidler: Are professions maybe the grind for Dragonflight?
[3:39:43] Zippaya: it will be easier to do mythic raid than craft probably :D
[3:39:47] chickenwienersoup: add degrading graduate to skills so you can't just park alts to make shit
[3:39:48] Nachozdood: lol this is the AP grind
[3:39:53] Sollice: If you mother fuckers cant count, whip out the calculator before you type lol
[3:39:59] PadidinJones: Prob crafting more and more
[3:40:03] EKS90_: @Nachozdood no....
[3:40:05] haris7: the other one is 20
[3:40:08] MuddyMcGir: just short of 900 points
[3:40:12] im_capy: Craftoholics should be hyped
[3:40:17] JBonezey: You might be getting more points than you will in live
[3:40:21] blossomcamm: i love this
[3:40:30] o00o0o0oo: "Re-ageant"
[3:40:32] lunchbox8669: so its worth it then
[3:41:01] Kyletyldesley: I dont mind it taking forever if the progress stays relevant, But if its reset next patch im goin back to FF KEKW
[3:41:19] Tamz_tv: so resourceful
[3:41:20] Gotxiko: really didn't expect the professions overhaul to have talents and be this nice
[3:41:20] Zippaya: I see my gathering will pay a bills for entire xpac
[3:41:32] Kakan_94: I really wish they would do the annual pass alpha/beta access thing again @Towelliee
[3:41:34] StoicRng: it would be neat to have crafting bounty's. a tab where if you craft the item,people buy it you get gold. get away from AH prices
[3:41:35] ottavianni: I feel it will nmb
[3:41:39] Lasidor: @towelliee make me some loot bb!
[3:41:42] c0mmander_starscream: shitting out some gold
[3:41:42] Gotxiko: DF shaping up as a good expansion lol
[3:41:45] luckfore: most my guildies quit after nathria but are very interested in DF
[3:41:46] Wolfenhoof: OhMyDog
[3:41:51] JBonezey: I'm excited to start the Artisan Point grind
[3:41:52] luckfore: of my*
[3:42:01] Kneckt: @StoicRng thats what work orders are fir
[3:42:06] Gotxiko: yea
[3:42:06] Mitune: Can you test the work order system?
[3:42:13] dracullus: and make secondary account wide
[3:42:15] isseidahk: like first aid?
[3:42:19] Picklz: do they have the gathering skill trees?
[3:42:20] MammothGB: would help some of the eye watering mat prices on ah
[3:42:20] lunchbox8669: all gathering professions should be secondary
[3:42:21] ottavianni: maybe u can mix and match those
[3:42:22] Xehanort1986: So like WoD Garrison where you could get mining & herbing stuff :P
[3:42:27] CYNIC308: Guild Hall Housing WHEN?
[3:42:27] zorantt: Remember, this is per toon, per profession
[3:42:27] MasterNeff: I couldn‚Äôt agree more
[3:42:28] Ojo4: Check out the alch trees maybe?
[3:42:29] hailsatan_667: will the gathering professions have talent trees, as well?
[3:42:29] Motivess: Two primary and all secondary on one toon?
[3:42:29] TheCliffyShow: NO you can't.
[3:42:30] Wolfenhoof: It would be even ok to cut the main professions to one then
[3:42:33] NufinTV: Blizzard going to make bank with wow tokens, so many going to buy to level these professions
[3:42:34] TheCliffyShow: They removed the portal.
[3:42:34] StoicRng: oh first ive heard from it @Kneckt
[3:42:37] Zwarx32: @dracullus lmao no not account wide for this
[3:42:39] Gotxiko: evoker farming alt thanks to their racial
[3:42:39] Kakan_94: I really wish they would do the annual pass alpha/beta access thing again @Towelliee
[3:42:39] Velashen: I feel like I will have to level my druid just as a gather.
[3:42:40] BlewGamingGroup: garthering skill should honestly be  a secondary skill  . Ion knows we all take 2 primary for raiding
[3:42:41] andrejhmm: @Towelliee FISHING. F I S H I N G !!!
[3:42:41] executeru: talent tree is cool! better then original trees, you gotta give up something to get something
[3:42:57] Kneckt: search it
[3:43:11] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They need to make skinning/mining/herb a secondary
[3:43:16] zorantt: How's the fishing tree?
[3:43:20] almostdps: Black dragon seared alloy might just be the reagent from raid?
[3:43:21] Milanesa_De_Pollo: With regional AH, those professions won't be worth having as a main
[3:43:31] JBonezey: Secondary are the same
[3:43:33] TheCliffyShow: You can't go to Valdrakken. They removed the portal.
[3:43:44] Flaaf: Mining should be main profession, otherwise it grants all players the ability to farm, making it less of a unique and impactful choice
[3:43:46] Mitune: They should make skinning, mining, and herbalism into small minigames as well. Not just click and go
[3:43:49] Radiag: @StoicRng work orders mean that someone get set a work order for what they want with the mats they have and a commission they're willing to pay and then a crafter can come along and craft it, best thing is this works with BoP items, since it goes straight to the customer
[3:43:55] Radiag: *can set
[3:44:04] ashnmsr: isn't smelting for mining tho?
[3:44:13] ramsesmj12: armorsmithing
[3:44:15] Xehanort1986: Think your tree
[3:44:25] StoicRng: thats really cool @Radiag
[3:44:42] nimshot: Just hit up Wrathion for some alloy :D
[3:44:46] Mitune: isnt the only black dragon so far the 2nd to last boss of the raid? @Towelliee
[3:44:53] Gotxiko: or maybe mythic dungeon material
[3:44:54] V4NDEL: if you learn mining it is in the tree threre?
[3:44:56] o00o0o0oo: aerosmithing
[3:45:05] Motivess: no way that aint mythic quality
[3:45:09] Zwarx32: @flaaf how did the ‚Äúunique‚Äù and ‚Äúimpactful‚Äù choices of covenants go? Lowest wow sub count ever. Professions should be just like new world
[3:45:15] Biorrwolf: Are you more pumped for DL or Wrath Classic?
[3:45:16] BlewGamingGroup: @Towelliee they need to make gathering a secondary or make it to where if you drop a skill you can learn another skill and then once youre done with it you can relearn your original with all the patterns you knew before .. kinda like multispec for   skills
[3:45:18] Motivess: I assume they just didnt put it bop right now
[3:45:19] Cakeabsorber: What happens if its boe?
[3:45:24] andrejhmm: @Towelliee Ian said it will tho,
[3:45:29] SeckSymbols: @Zwarx32 Ew, New World
[3:45:31] DPeachGaming: @Towelliee it sounds like people with 2 crafting professions will need to split them, am I right to assume that?
[3:45:35] joe_g_433: Anything cool with engineering???
[3:45:38] fokeriser: imagine being hyped for a 15year old game p[epeLaugh
[3:45:41] lunchbox8669: Can someone or has anyone asked Ion if they are even considering making all gathering as secondary professions.
[3:45:47] Zwarx32: @secksymbols best crafting >>
[3:45:49] feels____: how does quality change the crafted item?
[3:45:54] DJ_PWNZ: such a minor thing, but i think its BS that you dont get the allied race armor if you boost a toon to 60
[3:45:54] Radiag: some of the mats will be BoP as well for the best stuff so you HAVE to provide them for a work order
[3:45:55] kingxjzeus: yeah didnt they stop relearning a skill in shadowlands?  U used to be able to relearn and you get all your old stuff back.
[3:45:58] Cakeabsorber: ooohhh
[3:46:00] SeckSymbols: @Zwarx32 I would rather have FF14 crafting
[3:46:00] Nevindaz: exactly
[3:46:03] MammothGB: I like that so long as it can still get amde through work orders
[3:46:06] MammothGB: made*
[3:46:09] Joefoshow15: precisely
[3:46:12] Metalcalfe: How's that any different than buying work orders?
[3:46:13] WhoIsAndrewJ: @Stopnsmellmynutz god, please no
[3:46:13] thenormalbeast: You can still do the same but buying mats :/
[3:46:13] Joefoshow15: they cant do that
[3:46:19] SeckSymbols: @Stopnsmellmynutz Oh god no
[3:46:19] MrFuzzynuts420: makes sense to me
[3:46:22] akia03: cant you use workorders for that
[3:46:22] Zwarx32: @secksymbols lmao of course you play FF. that sucks
[3:46:22] Drengarth: will make blizz a lot cash, we'll see
[3:46:22] Nevindaz: only if they get rid of the token sys
[3:46:23] Moobot: hasan666, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:46:25] MrFuzzynuts420: i wanna buy my gear
[3:46:28] Gotxiko: being BoP is fine, you can make them through the workorder system
[3:46:32] o00o0o0oo: lol starter kit
[3:46:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Buying starter gear seems fine to me
[3:46:42] Scoodles91: its soulbound
[3:46:50] Metalcalfe: Yes but how is that any different then buying it on the AH?
[3:46:51] MammothGB: that's good
[3:46:51] RiptoreCA: How was the dungeons?
[3:46:52] blossomcamm: @zwarx32 tbh I like ff crafting over new world lol did not like new world at all LUL
[3:46:52] SeckSymbols: @Zwarx32 Imagine not knowing a single thing about a game and shitting on someone who plays multiple MMO's and likes a certain part of an MMO. Of course you play New World, that sucks.
[3:46:58] Zippaya: maybe they put that one mat you need on mythic end boss
[3:46:59] PokerFaceMoose: but they are still using gold on it right
[3:47:00] o00o0o0oo: starter kits are usually good
[3:47:00] Megadisaster24: Token being tied to gold was the worse thing they did to the game
[3:47:04] Flaaf: @Zwarx32 Making everyone be able to use, make, applicate, obtain everything makes nothing special and unique
[3:47:06] SeckSymbols: @blossomcamm Dudes a cunt, not worth speaking to
[3:47:07] thenormalbeast: Because the main Material comes from Mythic Raiding (BOP) and stuff, makes sense
[3:47:08] almostdps: inspiration
[3:47:13] Kneckt: @Metalcalfe because only the mythic raider will have the mythic mat thats required
[3:47:14] o00o0o0oo: like costco
[3:47:18] sselesu: seems inspiration
[3:47:19] Zwarx32: @secksymbols imagine assuming I haven‚Äôt played it. It‚Äôs just bad bro
[3:47:21] StoicRng: mailing a LionHeart Executioner

[3:47:34] backstreetalright: H erealized the menaing of life
[3:47:35] Reflux1988: this looks really awesome
[3:47:37] Gutroan: it does have the highest quality
[3:47:41] Naturalbeef: To have that crafted Mythic gear, you will need to get mats from the Mythic raid.
[3:47:42] blossomcamm: @zwarx32 go back to new world then LUL
[3:47:42] Aidler: What does the crafter get from crafting a raid item for a raider?
[3:47:43] andrejhmm: You got Inspired LUL
[3:47:51] Kneckt: @Aidler comission
[3:48:00] blossomcamm: @secksymbols oh I know LUL gotta love ppl like that
[3:48:03] Zwarx32: @blossomcamm no it sucks now. I want DF

[3:48:11] Aidler: pfff commission
[3:48:16] Cakeabsorber: Now you can titanforge the gear yourself Pog
[3:48:20] Wolfenhoof: I'd wish those huge Tauren would stay after release, they are so beautiful BibleThump
[3:48:20] Scoodles91: its lvl 70 you cant wear it
[3:48:28] luchion09: yes just worded diff lol
[3:48:32] Wolfenhoof: @Stopnsmellmynutz that is sad but true
[3:48:32] Gotxiko: titanforging is back but locked in crafting
[3:48:34] Elrab: Mythic recipes should at least be account bound if not BOE so people that get them on mains are rewarded to gear up alts easily
[3:48:34] Moobot: trivotix, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[3:48:34] Gotxiko: basically
[3:48:39] Aidler: I want to get more power from crafting
[3:48:40] sselesu: But u cant go higuer than quality 5 not like titanforging
[3:48:54] Joefoshow15: so that is going to be BIS @Towelliee ? min maxing crafting gear
[3:48:54] CYNIC308: but isnt paying for raid carry basically the same thing? like its paying gold and literally standing at the entrance to get loot and acheevs?
[3:49:02] kimmo_gaming: thats titanproffesioning LOL
[3:49:27] hirosan84: even professions have talent trees now
[3:49:27] azukh1: this system looks awesome, really excited to do all the professions on all my characters

[3:49:45] blossomcamm: i love this crafting system tho I'm hype for it I hope there are more collectibles like mounts and stuff we can craft in DF as well
[3:49:54] MirroredZephyr: might give me a reason to not be alchemy/engineering on every single toon lol

[3:50:10] Aidler: I'm not crafting for raiders only for a commission I then can't do anything with
[3:50:11] almostdps: people gonna be buying mythic runs where they get all the proffession reagents
[3:50:13] Wolfenhoof: You need two token now, one for the boostercrap and one for the crafter Kappa
[3:50:16] grumpnamedjosh: You craft the alloys much quicker also now
[3:50:18] isseidahk: get loans for the gear from guilds now with interest on payback

[3:50:52] V4NDEL: sorry did i miss is mining in the alpha?
[3:50:56] Gotxiko: by the time guilds sell mythic runs, it doesnt matter what gear people get or where they get it from, that's farming phase
[3:51:09] Larc9783: What was the name of that gold lending service that all the  big raid guilds got into drama with a couple years ago?
[3:51:11] precision79: oh :D the more you know :D

[3:51:50] ninetynil: towHAMUP
[3:52:01] xReadyAimMissx: @Volatilestyle it was the bot you dingus. LUL
[3:52:12] DragonofWolves: Actually that moobot command was for lost ark. I wouldn't worry too much about it chat
[3:52:13] Rabiahtaro132: Do you think this will be a form of bad luck protection in raids?
[3:52:22] Volatilestyle: since when has that phrase been banned?

[3:53:38] isseidahk: wait wait wait i missed it
[3:53:39] Joefoshow15: maybe the gear will be inspired up to mythic raid level but not inspired past it?
[3:53:45] mcgillacutty916: I just picked up a pair of Gunnar blue light glasses yesterday. They are dope
[3:53:53] Volatilestyle: they have way over complicated professions jesus

[3:54:45] kazobtw: p
[3:54:46] BitsyOD: have they explained how work orders work bc one of my first thoughts was whats stopping someone from just taking ur mats and running?
[3:54:48] Spec69: the difficulty lowered with it?
[3:54:49] Gotxiko: so its the quality what decides the ilvl
[3:54:55] zorantt: Have they announced if dragon isles will be a linear leveling experience (like Shadowlands) or if we can pick our zones (like Legion)?
[3:54:57] lotheriann: This crafting looks soo good
[3:55:04] PadidinJones: Daaamn they are really putting in the professions in this expac

[3:56:52] Rabiahtaro132: Everything needs to be tested eventually, might as well be crafting while we are here!
[3:56:52] iamWaritself: So what you're telling me is that professions are a tad useful again?
[3:56:57] vic_ave: Mr. robot trash
[3:56:58] TheUnknowing: @killtor new models arent in so its just shadowlands models
[3:57:00] isseidahk: its definitely more casual focused. and thats okay. the game needs more casual people playing as they make up more of the population.

[3:57:09] zorantt: @Towelliee What's that bar at the top? (goes dark to yellow)
[3:57:10] xReadyAimMissx: so let me get this straight. the expac will let us do blacksmithing, leatherworking, alchemy etc as opposed to the whole 2 we currently limited to? danHmm

[3:57:59] Kale_Nd: @Mitune  you can recraft crafter gear to change secondary stats
[3:58:07] Mitune: yeah they did mention increasing potentially @xReadyAimMissx
[3:58:11] zinbers: I wonder how jewalcrafting alchemy or inscription professional tree is like

[4:00:21] spencernpp: can the dragon classes glide like demon hunters
[4:00:32] spencernpp: @Mitune like in runescape!

[4:06:58] tornbraclet: they might add a quest like they had back in the day with weapon smithing and armor smithing
[4:06:59] kyoone07: @Towelliee have you done the new dungeon already ?
[4:06:59] CritcobainTV: Pog
[4:07:03] zinbers: There probably going to gradually release receipts over the time of the expansion or have special receipes in dungeon and raids
[4:07:07] zorantt: @Towelliee Didn't you unlock the blacksmith tree at 25? Maybe cooking is the same
[4:07:10] Finiin: cooking should have one, Spec into like feasts or stat spec food or something

[4:08:49] Jack_the_Dipper: Aaah those. Hire a person to farm the soulbounded reagents :p
[4:08:56] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Are they forcing Blacksmithers to also be miners?
[4:08:56] DaProfit: you think this system is designed to limit botting?
[4:08:57] Jarlan23: do the soul bound mats drop from mining nodes ?
[4:09:00] zinbers: You have to go out and explore

[4:09:16] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I kinda like this logic. This could create good communities just for professions.
[4:09:19] TheCliffyShow: You have to do the one thing a WoW player hates most. Work for something.
[4:09:19] Rabiahtaro132: Could you make your alts their own armor with this system using the order crafting?

[4:09:29] zinbers: Yes it is
[4:09:32] Xehanort1986: @Towelliee I think cooking might have a tree at lvl25, similar to the Blacksmithing one?
[4:09:34] Sleepylol93: I think the dudes from ashes talked about their system which seems similar to this now
[4:09:38] mavericks312: its designed to slow the gear buying for raiding
[4:09:39] XiMoee: Gathering profession should become secondary professions
[4:09:39] Q_TheDreamer: @Towelliee Thanks for responding!
[4:09:42] warrenny: @thecliffyshow Sounds awful Kappa
[4:09:46] nightwolf_87: Pog

[4:10:50] Ralykx: what's that other infusion power add?

[4:11:15] Nazz_1138: ohhh
[4:11:17] Xehanort1986: Think cooking gets maybe a tree at skill 25, similar to Blacksmithing?
[4:11:18] Nazz_1138: good call
[4:11:21] zorantt: @Towelliee Didn't you unlock the blacksmith tree at 25? Maybe cooking is the same?
[4:11:26] Sleepylol93: Happy they took the idea from ashes of creation, seems very similar to that
[4:11:32] Finiin: @Towelliee idk if you should it already, but can you show what the armor looks like?
[4:11:40] zorantt: Ah
[4:11:40] Ojo4: Could you check out the alchemy spec trees too?
[4:11:46] EKS90_: @hetgullegastje there is no updated monk talents yet. so no need to play it yet really.
[4:11:49] BlewGamingGroup: @Towelliee have they put in the item to re-roll the item after its been crafted ?
[4:11:55] zenkodac: maybe it just isnt ready for cooking
[4:11:55] Pilha390: cooking could be bug too
[4:12:01] NEMERL: @Towelliee new weapons models on WH
[4:12:03] Fugazi811: @hetgullegastje people only playing classes with talent trees released
[4:12:10] AG_morris: @hetgullegastje Ooooh okee, thanks man!
[4:12:16] vladtepes490: So are they handling blacksmithing like they did in BC? Where you can only craft certain weapons with weapon smithing and certain armor with armorsmithing?
[4:12:25] Oriion_: Where is my 50% exp buff?
[4:12:30] Rosebeld: I am thinking of returning with the dragonflight but I wanna learn how the new crafting feels? Will new crafting make some of the end game item grind more streamlined or will be useless in your opinion ?
[4:12:38] TheHoboWithAShotgun: They should expand cooking make it much more useful 4 raiding
[4:12:41] Rabiahtaro132: A community crafting stream would be so chill.
[4:12:53] Alepouditsa: i love the new bag thing danHype

[4:29:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: uh oh
[4:29:20] Honvar: their*
[4:29:22] just_akkuma: @ZyntosAran yeah, maybe, but i mean it looks dull, maybe it improves while in group or at later stages, what im seeing is totally underwhelming
[4:29:23] TurboedTV: ‚ùå
[4:29:24] dillapuss: I really wish they would have encrypted all this.
[4:29:29] Khailaan: Didn't we kill Maly?
[4:29:33] Yerella: time travel things i guess?
[4:29:36] Cezzan: Man i kinda feel bad for Neltharion
[4:29:36] luckfore: damn cool place
[4:29:36] Xehanort1986: Guess blue drakes native on this isle dont know Malygos is dead?
[4:29:37] MarquisLek: spoilers!

[4:30:40] shimwood: A good burn
[4:30:40] literally_human_garbage: it hurts so good
[4:30:41] Xehanort1986: tbf, fire "healed" Bolvar during the Wrathgate ;)
[4:30:42] nesman27: its a good burn Kappa
[4:30:43] Cezzan: Bolvar got living flame'd LUL
[4:30:46] silversquall88: Same fire that saved Bolvar @Towelliee

[4:30:47] BrowneePoints: I mean, look at Alexstrasza
[4:30:47] j_bar111: Diid someone say WOON!
[4:30:48] imnasusbru: kinky :)
[4:30:48] Q_TheDreamer: I feel like Bolvar would have thoughts about that
[4:30:50] Rabiahtaro132: Red magic, is life magic.
[4:30:51] Nachozdood: its the same living flame that the red dragonflight has
[4:30:51] Mecabeast: I mean that's how bolvar was saved right
[4:30:56] Jokervenom1978: Like when the Red Dragons burned Bolvar
[4:30:56] akia03: just look how well it works with bolvar
[4:30:57] Lightasaurus: makes em feel warm inside
[4:30:58] Rabiahtaro132: I guess
[4:31:00] RiptoreCA: This is a sweet looking cavern
[4:31:10] DragonofWolves: Ok now I'm not even sure where this setting is supposed to take place. It's defintely not Cata like I thought. Sure as hell ain't WoTLK
[4:31:16] Pilha390: @Mecabeast well that was a way of saving him
[4:31:17] Honvar: @bawheid I don't know why, maybe because armor does not 'work' on their dragon form?
[4:31:23] Ithylz: It makes you look crispy
[4:31:26] TheCliffyShow: Bolvar looks like the perfect picture of health.
[4:31:28] Cezzan: Will bolvar appear in dragonflight? or blizz got tired of him?
[4:31:29] Yerella: maybe an incarnate
[4:31:30] Q_TheDreamer: They might just be devotees
[4:31:30] Durithane: servant of Malugos
[4:31:30] hotmanpop: probably a servant of Maly
[4:31:30] szble: no they took orders from him
[4:31:33] Hood______: a follower
[4:31:37] CritcobainTV: Saggy lapdog? wut
[4:31:41] BrowneePoints: or one of his brood
[4:31:44] fokeriser: his brood EZ
[4:31:47] Xehanort1986: Think they are native blue drakes on the isle, thus not knowing Malygos is dead
[4:31:51] literally_human_garbage: they don't know Malygos is dead ... or he's back???
[4:31:52] Gotxiko: listen dude
[4:31:55] OviTheGray: maybe they dont know Malygos is dead
[4:31:56] kyoone07: Listen, Dudester LUL

[4:32:01] Darthyrevan: Darthyrevan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[4:32:02] raldrik: the evoker run animation. It looks like a N64 run animation
[4:32:03] Motivess: 10k xp is what you get lvl at 50, interesting
[4:32:07] iTzNiightyNiite: Have you had the chance to try the new instances?
[4:32:07] TheCliffyShow: Lappy sac gos
[4:32:10] Armani1Xp: It is malygos timeline is different
[4:32:22] kyoone07: Pog big dragon
[4:32:24] EKS90_: @literally_human_garbage The dragon isles have been shut of ffrom the world, so malygos being dead shouldnt have reached the dragon isles.
[4:32:28] Yerella: Lapisagos looks good tho
[4:32:40] KatieGaming: for now lol
[4:32:46] mavericks312: put dragons in a xpac instant banger
[4:32:49] DragonofWolves: Commander_Eggi true true'
[4:33:04] TheCliffyShow: Malygos could return somehow. Sindragosa did.
[4:33:05] Rabiahtaro132: Even the game is backseat gaming.
[4:33:12] kyoone07: EZ Clap
[4:33:12] RiptoreCA: Do you think there will be a large % of Evokers raiding?
[4:33:18] DragonofWolves: Commander_Eggi news of Neltharion becoming DW wouldn't have reached the isles either
[4:33:21] OviTheGray: well.. we got that thing that Sindragosa is now, maybe another Malygos too :)
[4:33:21] goofywizard: They can be so flexible with Dragonflight! So many ways to take this expansion forward
[4:33:22] Molvonos: Would that make it a Crush then?
[4:33:26] Daarksyde: i love the dragon snarling and sound effects
[4:33:29] WSeveryn: @towelliee man can't wait to see Vengeance and prot paladin trees.  but blood looks so good so may switch for dragon flight
[4:33:37] Oriion_: 3rd spec - Gardener
[4:33:42] mavericks312: @RiptoreCA if its anything like DH's DK's and monks yes lol
[4:34:00] EKS90_: @DragonofWolves Exactly, which is why atm, they are still "loyal to the earthwarder" and shit ^^ I cannot wait to maybe learn more about that, deathwing is my favourite char in all of wow haha. except arthas.
[4:34:04] RiptoreCA: This feels most like a Beta, or even launch. Have you seen anything weird or buggy yet with this class or this zone?
[4:34:04] Xehanort1986: Check map to see how many acts there are for this starting zone?
[4:34:18] MARTZiiE: towellie what are some downfalls you can see with this new class ?
[4:34:38] BrowneePoints: double tap
[4:34:51] goofywizard: Single target dps maybe
[4:34:57] literally_human_garbage: Oh did Malygos put the Drac'thyr in stasis when Neltharion turned?
[4:34:59] luckfore: hey this was the area from the leaked screenshot pre dragonflight
[4:35:01] DiiscoViking: creche- from latin cripia "crib", a place where the young are cared for
[4:35:08] goofywizard: They excel so good in AoE which is great for Mythic +
[4:35:28] Biorrwolf: Can they only be one class?
[4:35:34] ohh_juice: wonder if its better to get them off instantly ..too cast more spells

[4:35:59] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:36:00] Xehanort1986: Get Zereth Mortis 226 gear then i guess :P
[4:36:08] tornbraclet: if maligos had them in stasis they had to wait for so many expansions to release. So it seems like this was supposed to come after WoTLK
[4:36:08] francescothepainter: that's pretty good for 58 no?
[4:36:16] Xehanort1986: 1 of 7 chapters :o
[4:36:18] fokeriser: red for m+ blue for ST
[4:36:21] DragonofWolves: Commander_Eggi activiation of the isles might be the reason for the kresh being being brought back to life. These Dracythr might be whats going on and you have to find out why you've been brought out of stasis.
[4:36:22] hotmanpop: X

[4:39:48] TheCliffyShow: Our island is being attacked but take your time learning to fly.
[4:39:59] CritcobainTV: @cynic308 It's not the size of the wings, it's how u flap them
[4:40:05] Yerella: yea but 5 min CD tho... whack
[4:40:25] RageerPLZ: 5 minute cd, though better make sure you use it good from 1 spot
[4:40:43] CYNIC308: wing to body weight ratio should make DH the fastest flyers LUL
[4:40:50] DragonofWolves: This starting area is very interesting story wise.
[4:40:55] iMbrator: How come dragons can fly fast by soaring and swooping down.  Why can't my 1,000,000 mounts I have do it?
[4:41:05] Averegeguy: can you use Soar in instances like DH glide?
[4:41:13] ohh_juice: press 1

[4:43:13] Lightasaurus: podracing?
[4:43:15] ceranac23: how much is big zone
[4:43:21] goofywizard: If Dractyr can use soar, does that mean blizzard would put flying in every beginning of the expansion?

[5:16:43] silversquall88: would be cool
[5:17:11] TweektheProphet: i mean in live you will min have that 1-10 mount

[5:22:04] ventu105: what are they intending
[5:22:04] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:22:05] Mecabeast: wonder if we will get more drust stuff in DF
[5:22:23] Gandrius222: Is this blue or red build?

[5:23:24] Chiraakitteh: It‚Äôs a hero class, so 60
[5:23:28] Utmost777: they are raging against the machine
[5:23:48] abracka_: @MarshallOnline if you want to play it safe, i'd do wrath. there's still a high chance DF gets delayed to 2023
[5:23:55] abracka_: decent chance*
[5:23:57] andrejhmm: If all the Evil Dragons are United its going to be Hype,
[5:24:03] Cezzan: Shadowlands was supposed to have a drust raid
[5:24:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: leaked?
[5:24:09] Utmost777: maybe that is what 9.3 was supposed to be
[5:24:14] Vedros_: Do we know if this zone will be reused for endgame or is it just the intro experience?
[5:24:18] Lightasaurus: Are you able to get the reddit bot that corrects people in twitch chat when they misspell drakthur?
[5:24:19] fokeriser: they want DF out in 2022 sl is too awful
[5:24:30] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @UtmostOwnage more like 9.2
[5:24:49] SDMaze: drust-raid - Korthia  sp?

[5:39:22] andrejhmm: @Towelliee  Taliesin spilled the beans that you will have to choose between Ebisian and Wrathion on who will lead the Black Dragon Flight like you had to choose for Demon Hunters.

[5:39:35] SpoofAvatar: he gave zero fucks
[5:39:37] Poopiepants: Is Anduin dead?
[5:39:39] hotmanpop: biggest feedback on starting evoker zone, is the Soar cooldown should not exist in that zone

[5:40:31] solsaver12: 6year Nightmare
[5:40:34] bigcountry555: 6 years seems about how long shadowlands feels its taken
[5:40:34] PlagueHit: never choose Wrathion, he is so suspicous

[5:40:46] OviTheGray: @andrejhmm wasnt it Wrathion or Sabellian , is Ebonhorn?
[5:40:47] sliproach: feels like 6 years tbf
[5:40:53] Nerendis: I think the time skip is a really old rendition. It‚Äôs a bug that only 1 person has created. Seems super fishy @towelliee I would not trust it. I think twitter/wowhead jumped the gun here.
[5:40:56] BlewGamingGroup: anduin taking a break til 11.0
[5:40:56] Nachozdood: Anduin the run away king
[5:40:56] Mecabeast: we have been killing 8 boars since we got back from SL

[5:41:15] im_capy: Anduin gonna come back swoll and a total chad
[5:41:16] JoshStrobl: They leaned into the content drought so hard we skipped 6 years LUL
[5:41:19] strchsr: @Towelliee So to be fair, Wrathion and Ebyssian both know the troubled past of the Black Dragonflight but Ebyssian has always taken a more supportive role while Wrathion was more proactive in his approach to perceived threats
[5:41:19] Milanesa_De_Pollo: so there is or isn't a timeskip?
[5:41:21] amricatt: That would be cool if time has gone by.
[5:41:22] temp3st98: he's going to sleep
[5:41:23] andrejhmm: @OviTheGray No that is not Ebonhorn.
[5:41:24] Kriven: @Archiee i mean he needed a vacation after having to listen to slyvannus for 2 years

[5:42:12] tebbix: Anduin is literally a zoomer KEKW
[5:42:13] chrslp: I mean its not like Stormwind is really used anymore. No need for a King LUL
[5:42:17] neo_0098: @towelliee I really really hope they dont go the same direction with wrathion like with deathwing that he becomes currupted and ends up as the endboss
[5:42:25] Kriven: i love the art in the new zones so far
[5:42:31] Kedemel: Anduin is going to be the BIG BAD in the expansion following DF.
[5:42:31] Nowaayjose: So Anduin is doing a Varian in classic damn

[5:47:43] EzeGen: I'm excited. I can't wait
[5:47:48] Zilberg: Mid range dps does seem weird.. Like if a fight where you need both ranged and melee... I guess they stand next to the melee?
[5:47:53] fokeriser: black/bronze should be a tank
[5:47:55] StarbuckTech: lunch break... time to relax for the next hour watching you stream. Love the work from home life

[6:25:42] peinen: DoS but with a whole ass additional wing
[6:25:44] chubahi: @griffdog125  it is uldaman
[6:25:46] backstreetalright: Uldaman was always a hard dungeon glad they  kept it real
[6:25:47] kungbillan: It's a rework of Uldaman, they said they would redo old dungeons to swap active M+ dungeons each season
[6:25:52] abracka_: ion watching this rubbing his hands together like "this man doesn't even know we're putting this dungeon in every season"

[6:27:13] Mitune: Can people not just set the orbs on tops of the boss?
[6:27:13] Justintegra31: Did they remove threat percentages from the UI?
[6:27:20] xghostlore: maraudon is long
[6:27:25] angrywowplayer1337: Anyone ever go on a dating app and get annoyed at how many people on there already  kids, like why on earth would someone be interested in that much baggage?
[6:27:30] Razor9mm: Does this replace old Uldaman or is that old version still available for low levels?
[6:27:39] Robodope: can't the dps drop the circle on the boss
[6:27:48] Snowiton: why not adc drop this on the boss?
[6:27:53] tamos713: Longer than deadmines but no bed is the longest imo
[6:27:54] joesfarm: deadmines is long with everyone lvl 15
[6:27:56] Snowiton: why they drop it far then u move boss
[6:27:59] kungbillan: @Razor9mm This will probably replace the old one, simular like the Deadmines rework did, not sure though
[6:28:00] Kritex: You have a time window to run to other side of a orb
[6:28:01] GameteTV: It does work like that.  It looks like he can't lose orbs if he is in Titanic Empowerment
[6:28:05] Kritex: or slow him
[6:28:21] PinkTaricFTW: OMG, streamer doesn't know all the intricate strats on the first day?! Kappa

[6:30:53] fokeriser: maybe less
[6:31:07] kungbillan: They announced way back that they would swap active M+ dungeons each saeson. A mix between new dungeons and reworked old ones, this is one of the latter :)
[6:31:07] MerrickMoon: PLZ BLIZZ IT'S NOT TOO LATE
[6:31:08] PinkTaricFTW: Imagine 5 people with that effect :)
[6:31:09] nightst314: on a ship? in a dungeon?
[6:31:13] Kyletyldesley: it might be eventually its still alpha
[6:31:13] aid280: So have they just wprked in the covenant abilities into the talent tree?
[6:31:14] unsolved_return: Hey Towelliee
[6:31:16] SpyCrabbo: i feel like that would be too distracting
[6:31:16] Fusionxw: @Austei Yea, the roadmap started all the way back to 2017. After 5 years of hard work its finally getting realized. Ashes of Creation will be a master piece that will be optimized and finalized to his maximum potential.
[6:31:16] MerrickMoon: I wanna see that too
[6:31:31] EKS90_: @aid280 some of them. not all of em. and also added some new things.
[6:31:31] fokeriser: @Fusionxw COPIUM
[6:31:32] Austei: if i see occulas remake ima cut someone lol
[6:31:36] Zinaroth: You have trinkets that summon minions dunno how this would graphically harder or more demanding
[6:31:45] StareTV: @kungbillan this is the pre-patch event dungeon, not planned for m+ at all i think
[6:31:52] felstained: is this the dragon boss?
[6:31:54] EdLok_: I don't think uldaman is that interesting. Alot played Classic
[6:31:58] aid280: @aid280 ah thats cool
[6:31:58] Fusionxw: @fokeriser I literally cannot wait for it
[6:32:02] TheRealAxiom: Why did they bring this one back? So lame
[6:32:17] Zekiram2000: They do get on their Viking ship and rain fire
[6:32:18] xghostlore: See, every boss is just in a big circle room, its so boring
[6:32:25] fokeriser: @Fusionxw ue5 looks good to be fair but i doubt it will have enough content,also games that take forever to come out rarely work out
[6:32:28] fokeriser: because people move on
[6:32:30] fokeriser: but we'll see
[6:32:32] NVbrutal: this will be a M+ dungeon as well as pre patch event. its part of the 8 dungeons thats supposed to be at launch
[6:32:34] EKS90_: @TheRealAxiom cause its cool and the titan lore tie into the dragon aspects.
[6:33:10] fokeriser: healer? pepeLaugh
[6:33:41] Fusionxw: @fokeriser Can you give an example of games that took so long that never worked out?
[6:33:46] TheRealAxiom: Or just make a new dungeon lol
[6:33:54] backstreetalright: I apretiate the changes blizz made  in the game for me but man where is the mana infinite?
[6:34:04] abracka_: blizz putting out a blue post on DKs for wrath pre patch, no dates though. classic andys on fire rn
[6:34:06] backstreetalright: why is the mana inifnite*
[6:34:07] EKS90_: @Fusionxw Duke nuken forever.
[6:34:09] Robodope: discount halondrus
[6:34:12] fokeriser: @Fusionxw star citizen,but yeah tons of scams that never came out
[6:34:15] Gevers_GgM: i dunno pretty wide for a blink
[6:34:16] SpyCrabbo: blink through only to be out of range from the healer
[6:34:18] Kritex: healer died
[6:34:25] fokeriser: didn't even get to the failure part
[6:34:26] Keirmot: Just grab NightFae and you're set XD
[6:34:27] Jomuse92: noooo
[6:34:46] Bennodkk: envokers are definitely not  going to be the healer pick for high keys too weak
[6:34:50] Loadsofjuice: What was new for this weeks alpha content? I haven‚Äôt seen any updates
[6:34:57] ottavianni: seems hard on heal ,all the moving
[6:34:58] Kritex: actually going to miss having blink on my warlock @Keirmot
[6:35:07] WhoIsAndrewJ: @Bennodkk what about evokers though?
[6:35:13] Zwarx32: @bennodkk lmao shut up you have no idea
[6:35:20] Darkpepp: m+15+ like this fight. :)
[6:35:20] SpyCrabbo: @Bennodkk yes let's determine that from a scaled normal dungeon in week 2 of alpha
[6:35:20] Fusionxw: @fokeriser Ashes is bound to work out. They could still take a other 10 year and it will be a master piece taking over the MMO gendra. Thats why the creators are so confident into their own project. Nothing else will set apart from Ashes of creation. Its one life deal.
[6:35:21] Guffels: @Loadsofjuice shaman trees and drac starting zone + some professions
[6:35:25] EKS90_: @Bennodkk this is also at scaled levels with low gear. cannot judge it to harsh in this enviroment
[6:35:34] JediNeo99999: that boss wrecked one of my groups for 10-15 pulls
[6:35:40] fokeriser: @Fusionxw in 10years time all of the tech being used in any game
[6:35:42] Robodope: nobody stood in the flowers
[6:35:42] Shadowlemur01: jb is pumping with an evoker
[6:35:43] fokeriser: will be obsolete
[6:35:49] fokeriser: any current game*
[6:35:51] Nevindaz: Kappa
[6:35:53] notColt45: And no healer UI
[6:35:55] BRUTALIT0PS: BRUTALIT0PS subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[6:35:55] jontrann: evokers are overrated garbage
[6:35:57] Zekiram2000: They also don‚Äôt have all talents because level 60‚Äôs scaled to 70 without being able to pick those extra 10
[6:36:03] watpuppy: @Bennodkk This is ALPHA you psycho lol
[6:36:07] WhoIsAndrewJ: @jontrann who hurt you
[6:36:09] abracka_: @jontrann found the mistweaver monk
[6:36:11] Kalym117: @jontrann why you sound so hurt bud?
[6:36:13] Pilha390: and unique gameplay
[6:36:15] Kritex: You didnt get a lust either so you got it for last boss
[6:36:17] EKS90_: @jontrann Calm down.
[6:36:25] Kritex: Remind your shaman
[6:36:31] suvati68: Evokers ate my baby
[6:36:32] Hyelander_: @jontrann Tell us how you really feel
[6:36:33] Shadowlemur01: @jontrann yikes
[6:36:37] BlewGamingGroup: brand new class ... not parsing 100 ... fucking casual
[6:36:42] Kalym117: So much BabyRage PJSalt about the evokers KEKW
[6:36:44] Rabiahtaro132: Evokers seam pretty cool, I can't wait to play one.
[6:36:48] jontrann: stay mad butthurt evoker fanboys
[6:36:55] Guffels: @jontrann massive skill curve = garbage KEKW
[6:37:00] vocalpenguin: KEKWDISCO
[6:37:07] Kritex: Yall remember when DKs came out and some people refused to play it cause it was "over rated"
[6:37:13] Jomuse92: overrated this, underwhelming that, I'm just here to Evoke and breathe fire with the chat IonJam
[6:37:13] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The Preservation Evoker is the BEST NEW HEALING CLASS in Dragonflight youtu.be/jfCjH8QPqnQ
[6:37:16] watpuppy: jontrann probably a hunter main
[6:37:19] Zekiram2000: How dare you not master a class in the alpha -some rogue player named jontrann
[6:37:20] Kalym117: LUL Jontrann i hope your day gets better
[6:37:21] Manferno: eat a snickers @jontrann
[6:37:26] EKS90_: @jontrann I main a warrior and a paladin, not really a fanboy at all, but being this butthurt also is just hilarious. who hurt you in life?
[6:37:26] Zinaroth: People here complaining about evokers just couldn't spell "advanced" - all there is to it. Kappa
[6:37:31] Snowiton: i mean i dunno how "ADVANCED" evokers are. but sometimes u just have to isntantly heal mid dpsing
[6:37:34] Cezzan: @ZinarothMosberg KEKW
[6:37:50] Kalym117: @ZinarothMosberg Yesss HAHA
[6:37:50] Gezber: feels good to see Uldaman again FeelsBirthdayMan
[6:38:03] backstreetalright: Just rename retail to classic part 2
[6:38:04] Fusionxw: @fokeriser The thing about Ashes of creation is that they have zero competitors.  You could count blizzard in, but i think they have exceeded far beyond. Once ashes is released, it will be like taking candy from a baby :)
[6:38:25] JediNeo99999: jdotb was out dpsing a boomkin as healing evoker
[6:38:25] Gsuque: more than 4 spells to press = garbage KEKW
[6:38:29] felstained: @jontrann says evoker trash but will make one for his new main come Launch what a dummy
[6:38:29] EKS90_: @ZinarothMosberg or they got  to mad at the social contract so they just said this is "woke bullshit im just gonna complain in a twitch stream"
[6:38:36] fokeriser: @Fusionxw guess we'll see,at the end of the day if the mmo is good people will play it and we will have another worthy addition
[6:38:39] SpyCrabbo: i thought people were just being elitist on twitter but this dungeon really does seem like ass for m+
[6:38:45] Kritex: @Fusionxw AoC is promising alot that idk how they can actually make it all happen yaknow?
[6:38:46] Rabiahtaro132: The cool thing about classes you don't like is, don't play it and it won't bother you
[6:38:46] fokeriser: i'm just not optimistic there have been countless wow killers in the past
[6:39:07] XvShadow: is that Devolore healing or someone with a similar name? üòÑ
[6:39:08] Kaydwen: @towelliee hows the new build just tuning in?
[6:39:09] nightst314: are those trees just progressed via crafting or also questing @Towelliee ?
[6:39:10] EKS90_: @fokeriser Just stop thinking of mmos as " wow killers" and enjoy them for what they are.,
[6:39:11] PvtHudson093: the JC trinkets have me sold
[6:39:12] Jomuse92: I want to do the inscription. I've always been interested in that prof
[6:39:14] Cezzan: I dont think Ashes will be that good tbh, its way too overhyped
[6:39:17] meStevo: Kinda of interested in a classic version of the game with these new systems.  Even classic + newer spell effects / textures.
[6:39:20] Austei: OH awesomwe

[6:39:58] kyoone07: game is going on a good direction and there are people hating on it LUL they probably didn't play SL i guess
[6:40:04] OmgItsEdizzle: towHype towHype towHype
[6:40:07] Fusionxw: @Kritex What are they promising? They arent even releasing a "release date" so it doesnt fall in a promise .... like all the companies does nowdays. Rushing a game out with bugs and then dying after 2 and 3 weeks. Cash grab at its finest.
[6:40:14] grillchips231: IS there no working version of details for  the alpha?
[6:40:15] EKS90_: @fokeriser I like gw2 for what it is, just the gearing is not my taste of gearing, and i think SWTOR is a good game just very dated.
[6:40:33] procyon_mfc: It‚Äôs almost like a paragon for professions
[6:40:37] deadpoet777: so basically artifact trees from legion fishing?
[6:40:43] anarzaaa: these old models though

[6:41:22] BlockishTiger: have they added in new talent trees aside from Drakthyr?
[6:41:25] papao11: why do you have combo points as guardian
[6:41:25] procyon_mfc: First Aid was removed in BFA IIRC
[6:41:26] thevelblade: Hows guardian feeling with the new talent tree
[6:41:31] thevelblade: Im afraid of losing Ravenous
[6:41:34] fokeriser: shaman Clueless

[6:45:28] Jomuse92: I can log but it'll require me using your bathroom a bit Kappa
[6:45:28] Templexx: logs take the fun out
[6:45:29] Angxlic: go to encounters and trash fights and look at the graph and drag it across the dungeon
[6:45:39] Tassen95: I don't think you can do it after you uploaded though
[6:45:43] gritbarontv: if you are a min maxer then logs are your friends, :)
[6:46:12] raye_gaming22: you can just stop the recordingand start it again under a new name and it will be seperated
[6:46:26] strchsr: @Towelliee If you go into the Warcraft Logs app, you might be able to upload the log manually vs Live Log and select what you want included

[6:51:50] watpuppy: @Towelliee Have you ever healed in any capacity?
[6:51:51] backstreetalright: It seems ok so far I think
[6:51:53] GetCronkd: feral is s tier if ur good at it
[6:52:03] Jeeve_Stobs: Tauren mage next?
[6:52:10] Zinaroth: @GetCronkd LUL
[6:52:12] Jomuse92: I actually liked going Moment of clarity for the cat
[6:52:17] levano1990: hey, love u from Goergia
[6:52:17] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:52:31] Obitualist: Just tuning in, have you gone through the new dungeons yet?
[6:52:35] TheGiant99: God I want Alpha so bad but i guess i can wait
[6:52:40] Dopefishy: WOTLK is out soon isnt it
[6:52:49] GetCronkd: @ZinarothMosberg theres a reason its the 3rd highest ST class rn but not many of them
[6:52:50] kyoone07: we will never be slavesss SMOrc
[6:52:55] derBOB93: where do the combo points come from?
[6:52:56] Hyelander_: @GetCronkd Is that why all of high keys prefer DKs?
[6:53:02] Snowiton: SMOrc
[6:53:13] GetCronkd: @Hyeland3r ur thinking of guardian pal
[6:53:20] Lasidor: @towelliee how you liking the dungeons? Both seem pretty solid but the bosses in the fire one are super cool.
[6:53:23] Deekan33: Deekan33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months! 
[6:53:27] Snowiton: times change SMOrc
[6:53:34] house573: Do you think the new talent system will be susceptible to cookie-cutter builds?
[6:53:56] asmodai4823: ofc it will
[6:54:03] Zinaroth: @GetCronkd And completely alienated in Mythic plus and one of the hardest specs to get glad on. Feral is in the same spot it has been in since Cata
[6:54:05] Hyelander_: @GetCronkd Youre right, my bad. lemme rephrase. is that why mythics only take Survival hunter and locks?
[6:54:05] falldrgn: so WOTLK nax would be the same thing?
[6:54:07] Thoreya: i see ppl complaining about reusing old content. i feel like im in bizarro word. isnt that what we wanted
[6:54:10] Thoreya: i cant man
[6:54:11] Jarlan23: uldaman looks like its gonna be a pain in the ass on sanguine
[6:54:16] Thoreya: world*
[6:54:21] DaBestGAround: it will, but hopefully people still try out some of their choices
[6:54:34] DeanoTV: most people wish for old dungeons to come back
[6:54:34] Cezzan: @hemzi84 There will always be a cookie cutter build, but at least they look more flexible compared to the other talent iterations we had
[6:54:48] Texas_Mizfit: holy or disc priest?
[6:54:54] superb0y: superb0y subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months! 
[6:54:55] cahoots82: @Thoreya Sort of. Make old content relevant again, not present it as something new.
[6:55:03] papascruge: Hopefully people will start to get over this mets BIS bs minset
[6:55:15] papascruge: mindset*
[6:55:20] nyx_helios: no
[6:55:22] nyx_helios: never
[6:55:23] Thoreya: @cahoots82 how do u make older content relevant without it being new first?
[6:55:23] backstreetalright: Hey we got exactly what we wanted everyone must be happy
[6:55:25] GetCronkd: @ZinarothMosberg yea u could say that for tons of classes tho
[6:55:27] PrimalRain: that will never happen
[6:55:32] GetCronkd: but how many people are actually competing at mdi level
[6:55:34] cahoots82: and people take surv. hunters and destro locks in m+ because they simply do more damage than anyone else by a long shot.
[6:55:39] itsNODDERS: @Thoreya i think they want these things not as the main content because then they think blizz is lazy for reusing old content to create "new" content
[6:55:39] BlewGamingGroup: boomkin in bear form instead of a chicken
[6:55:48] Gillrad: @papascruge that mindset permeates all of gaming now
[6:55:49] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee how is Dragonflight Bear compared to SL bear?
[6:55:53] itsNODDERS: if that makes sense
[6:55:55] GetCronkd: feral druids are completing 29s but its just not viable on a competitive level
[6:56:04] DaBestGAround: @papascruge as long as people are critique based on meters, logs, and rio that will never go away
[6:56:18] cahoots82: @Thoreya By creating reasons for players to engage with those areas rather than the way it is now wherein previous expansion are almost completely ignored
[6:56:21] sliproach: @roadrrunnerr1 now we just need feral to work in bear form
[6:56:26] papascruge: @Gillrad yeah I know it, it's definitely my biggest pet peeve with what gaming has become
[6:56:33] cahoots82: Beyond that, I don't have an answer.
[6:56:42] Zinaroth: @GetCronkd You mean specs? Some specs have historically always dominated. Feral is definitely not one of them. It had a few short lived moments in the spotlight but have quickly been hit with the nerf bat each time.
[6:57:00] Hyelander_: You can take the least popular dps/heal/tank to any key with your friends. Dont expect to be in a pug though
[6:57:01] k3i3ool: knowing blizz they gona nurff that moonfire shit before the relece
[6:57:20] sliproach: @ZinarothMosberg bad kitty
[6:57:25] berserker_strike: warlock is a domantion class
[6:57:34] Zinaroth: @sliproach Lick my fur
[6:57:39] GetCronkd: @ZinarothMosberg just like survival is having its short lived moment right now...?
[6:57:45] GetCronkd: quite ironic
[6:58:00] bllynni6614: Just bring a dk duh
[6:58:02] tezok69: Yes, because we do that all the time, ranged!
[6:58:05] Endin: gives death grip a purpose
[6:58:09] nightst314: @Towelliee the hunter type. they don't cast anything, just throw shit
[6:58:13] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee it's the "DKs need to feel included"-mob
[6:58:17] bllynni6614: It‚Äôs the only use we have as dks
[6:58:20] sliproach: @ZinarothMosberg sure Kappa
[6:58:30] love_eggplant: wow ure being power infused
[6:58:30] house573: the best part so far about DF isn't dragon flying...it's the lack of maw intro chain.
[6:58:51] Wcvechten: oh that's a fun little mechanic
[6:59:10] WhoIsAndrewJ: @hemzi84 tbf there's no intro yet to test
[6:59:13] JediNeo99999: You can do heroic
[6:59:13] bllynni6614: @hemzi84 it‚Äôs the lack of maw and shadowlands zones
[6:59:17] Zinaroth: @GetCronkd The neglected feral community is meme because it is the truth. Survival as a melee spec has existed since Legion only so there is a lot less historical anecdotes to draw from.
[6:59:35] bllynni6614: Id assume it‚Äôs in the waking shore

[6:59:55] derBOB93: above the uldaman cave entrance
[6:59:55] flavio_ago: go to the badlands and try enter the tyr
[6:59:55] berserker_strike: is this nefarian lair from legion ?
[7:00:03] Mecabeast: wonder if you have to use the front entrance or the back entrance?
[7:00:14] GetCronkd: @ZinarothMosberg so it's existed since legion but has not seen an mdi comp considering until 9.2 of shadowlands?
[7:00:15] GetCronkd: ight
[7:00:17] GetCronkd: lmao
[7:00:35] Zinaroth: @GetCronkd And Feral has?
[7:00:35] MeisterPetze: what dungeon is this ? recolor of sestralis?
[7:00:42] monkpawfire: does the map exist
[7:00:44] skofaan3: are drakthyr doing good dmg?
[7:00:47] WhoIsAndrewJ: @ArasakaGer yeah, howd you know
[7:00:48] GetCronkd: guess ur missing the point
[7:00:54] AllDayMan: wheres asmon
[7:01:01] JediNeo99999: neing considered for MDI is irrelevant to a spec
[7:01:06] WhoIsAndrewJ: @AllDayMan who
[7:01:07] JediNeo99999: being*
[7:01:15] Zinaroth: Guess you're not making a proper one.
[7:01:19] BTiZZY_: @alldayman go ask him
[7:01:23] tebbix: @AllDayMan bruh, how would we know ?
[7:01:41] BigJustin26: looksl ike halls of atonement
[7:01:50] Zilberg: Its kinda crazy they only have 4 months to get everything done
[7:01:51] backstreetalright: Asmon is prob in shock cradling himself to sleep somewhere

[7:01:55] JediNeo99999: mr gm started uldaman heroic but someone left
[7:02:06] Luxicake: @AllDayMan check his twitter
[7:02:11] berserker_strike: looks like ToS from bfa
[7:02:54] Zilberg: This dungeon doesn't look too bad for a Mythic dungeon tbh
[7:03:16] berserker_strike: did they add new affixes from m+?
[7:03:17] leerane: This dungeon looks massive tbh
[7:03:34] voyage_icarus: I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how the red abilities aren‚Äôt healing, like the red flight is literally the ‚Äòlifebinders‚Äô
[7:03:35] lung_problem: what are your thoughts on prot paladin this xpax? its always been a favorite of mine
[7:03:37] BigJustin26: has a bit of a revendreth vibe imo
[7:04:10] Robodope: does a neural silencer work
[7:04:17] OriCol: Is brewmaster playable yet?
[7:04:27] han_saro: 32 minutes seems fairly long no?
[7:04:30] AllDayMan: did they add in an in game dps meter yet
[7:04:37] Mystai: @lung_problem don't think they've released the updates for them?
[7:04:38] goofywizard: 32 is long lol
[7:04:53] Artiiz: How are druid tanks?
[7:04:54] MeisterPetze: nice evoker tank bro
[7:04:58] Zilberg: This guy is kinda cool for a boss
[7:05:07] EKS90_: @han_saro I think a dungeon taking 30 imnutes should be a standard  but that is prob just me
[7:05:17] Gezber: this boss is sick
[7:05:27] EKS90_: @han_saro between 20-30 imo
[7:05:46] vocalpenguin: KEKWDISCO
[7:05:51] Artiiz: 30 min for a dung is way too long
[7:05:51] Wallusss: Gambit in shadowlands is the fastest dungeon and it's timer is 30 minutes. 32 isn't that bad when you put it up against the near 40 min timers
[7:05:54] JediNeo99999: there's a weapon form here i'll want on a prot pally
[7:05:58] Zilberg: Druid tank with pants on KEKW
[7:06:18] nightst314: trial of valor 45mins
[7:06:27] denflup: chances we get onyxias lair raid in dragonflight? @Towelliee
[7:06:28] Yordie_Sanders: WE cant have maw of souls every dungeon though KEKW
[7:06:35] Artiiz: @nightst314 thats a raid..
[7:06:36] nightst314: halls, my bad
[7:06:39] berserker_strike: Freehold best dungeon <3
[7:06:43] Zilberg: We don't talk about that form LUL
[7:06:48] berserker_strike: Tol dagor shit dungeon
[7:06:55] Mitune: none should last longer than 30 imo
[7:07:00] ceranac23: temple of jade serpent will be 20min
[7:07:08] Mecabeast: gambit is nice atleast
[7:07:12] EKS90_: I think 20-30 minutes is a good average cause it long enough to not feel daunting and not short enough to be to quick and forgettable.

[7:08:40] Ironcladd: just tuned in this the new dung?
[7:08:42] Thoreya: one of those 3
[7:08:42] Zilberg: He won't ever let you forget the torture he went through in the maw LUL
[7:08:58] AllDayMan: arcane?
[7:09:03] Zippaya: I want to see healing meter

[7:09:13] Artiiz: tomorrow
[7:09:17] EKS90_: holy fuck this was a chonker
[7:09:19] NispyCriblet: that sa cool ass boss
[7:09:21] han_saro: I think the longer the dungeon is, the more likely people are to abandon it early for a single wipe etc. just because they don't want to commit to the remaining long length of time.
[7:09:32] Artiiz: ^ +1
[7:09:32] darthturtle1031: I want a lava tentacle mamoth BibleThump BibleThump

[7:09:54] SSD511_: @iyomee  thanks buddy
[7:09:55] Zippaya: what a cool boss
[7:09:56] wreckshoptv: he is a mount
[7:09:59] lung_problem: fire hentai elephant boss, blizzard has officially outdone themselves
[7:10:01] ur_avg_tryhard: Will Mage Tower TW skins be available after DF launch?
[7:10:02] Mooimacow13: i want to tame him on my hunter
[7:10:03] Zinaroth: I made a bear build that has moonfire hit everyone and heal for 30% of damage done and Thrash/Maul shields for 75% of damage dealt. Sounds OP on paper.
[7:10:07] Angxlic: with the tentacles? hopefully
[7:10:08] Lasidor: @towelliee please stop dps so I can tame him on my hunter please.
[7:10:09] EKS90_: @han_saro I did a 4 hour BRD in classic LUL we had a blast, but I know that is a totaly different type of player.
[7:10:12] mutant21: tameable pet!
[7:10:17] akia03: there multiple colors of him
[7:10:19] Artiiz: @berserker_strike I think its for pulverize?
[7:10:31] han_saro: @han_saro Sorry, I was talking about M+ specifically.
[7:10:35] Zilberg: POGGERS
[7:10:35] Boosti661: Looks like more trash could be put in
[7:10:37] BlewGamingGroup: that hallway is missing its trash
[7:10:41] xxsargexx: where the tentacles at on the mount tho
[7:10:42] WhoIsAndrewJ: doesn't fly 1/10
[7:10:43] OviTheGray: @mutant21 he might be elemental tho :(
[7:10:47] ottavianni: i wonder if u cant tame it ?
[7:10:50] nesman27: magmoth Pog
[7:10:51] SDMaze: the  dungons seems  well done already.
[7:10:52] Zippaya: @mutant21 even better than mount :D
[7:11:09] berserker_strike: @Artiiz idk maybe
[7:11:09] sliproach: can it fly ? Kappa
[7:11:10] EKS90_: @han_saro ah yeah sorry haha  but yeah I do agree, which is why they need to do something about m+ leavers, give em dungeon lockouts or something. so people dont do that.
[7:11:26] Wcvechten: this dungeon looks really cool aesthetically tho, the npcs and everything
[7:11:27] Artiiz: @berserker_strike maybe not actually, trying to see which of his action buttons could be a spender but idk really haha
[7:11:32] Nokterian: bear tank looks crazy now lol
[7:11:40] Nokterian: oh yeah alpha subject to change
[7:11:55] akia03: whats the ground targeted ability you sometimes do?
[7:12:03] berserker_strike: @Artiiz I did the same but couldnt figure it out xD
[7:12:04] lightslegend: oh wait do bears have combo points again?
[7:12:22] Hyelander_: Tanks trying to get out of shield duty

[7:59:01] CrunkyBrewster: @Luxicake LUL good to know I'm not the only one on that boat. I thought maybe it was me
[7:59:03] TheGiant99: This dungeon looks badass
[7:59:06] Atem___: something going down at Blizzard it seems
[7:59:19] dyslexican1: lol are people really complaining that reagents are at the end of the dungeon?
[7:59:29] CrunkyBrewster: But Triple Triad is fun though. i like a lot of that stuff at least. its just not enough to keep me dedicated
[7:59:30] Zilberg: Frosk dk tanks when?
[7:59:41] muztho: another melee friendly expac it seems
[7:59:46] SurelyBaked: @dyslexican1 we live in a gaming industry now where people want to clear any bit of content as fast as possible
[7:59:46] muztho: giggles
[7:59:51] Rudric_Ice: @Zilberg classic wrath

[8:00:18] Kakotan2143: @Kakotan2143 darn it, when wrath came out, we were not stuck on any one DK tree to tank or DPS on :/
[8:00:20] Zilberg: Yeah no... I like new content LUL Rudric_Ice
[8:00:40] wulftrn: how are brewnasters ink dragonflight?
[8:00:44] wulftrn: in*
[8:00:47] Banjo586: @Kakotan2143 when wrath came out, dks were off the wall broken OP KEKW
[8:00:51] Fnchentai: doesnt feel like the blood dk feels squishy
[8:01:01] SurelyBaked: man anyone miss the good old blood DK dps days? KEKW
[8:01:14] asmodai4823: use your runic weapon more @Towelliee
[8:01:19] Kakotan2143: @Banjo586 YES But you could tank as Frost or DPS as Frost, same with Blood
[8:01:19] Zilberg: I do I wish they let Frost be tanks again
[8:01:41] LesterLinton: ohhh
[8:01:41] Rudric_Ice: i still think that BDK should have been DPS and Frost the Tank Spec
[8:01:44] MayorOfHookCity: Chat what difficulty is this dungeon?

[8:02:04] Korupcija_: so good
[8:02:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: This Blood is a lot better than the one at the start of Shadowlands, no doubt about that
[8:02:50] Zilberg: What does the fist weapon look like?
[8:02:55] SurelyBaked: One thing i'm pretty sure on about dragonflight is it has some pretty sick visuals so far in terms of armor/mounts/etc
[8:02:59] LesterLinton: the blue tint looks great
[8:03:08] xSimplyMike: CTLR click the fist weapon so we can see it
[8:03:21] LazyDynamics: ranged dps will definitly need to adjust to evoker healers in dungeons
[8:03:50] Blusax79: i would think most alpha players are at least decent
[8:04:02] Zilberg: LUL he teleported
[8:04:34] Moiste: i think they should scrap the 25-yard range for evokers. It's gonna lead to problems with raid
[8:04:36] Heuwzen: damn cool animations
[8:05:16] LesterLinton: did they say why it took 8hrs?
[8:05:21] The_Tacozilla: that new alpha build took ages to deploy, I gave up waiting and went to bed lol
[8:05:24] subversv: my guild has off weeks
[8:05:25] Banjo586: 3 day farm weeks seems awful
[8:05:28] aid280: Will you be doing the riad on stream?
[8:05:44] Kneckt: Did u get to starter area? I had to leave for bit
[8:05:47] subversv: i just never wanna do sepulcher again until s4 lol

[8:06:03] Zilberg: He did the starter area yeah @Kneckt
[8:06:05] LesterLinton: ohhh ok
[8:06:11] SurelyBaked: I got AOTC and then my guild fell apart months ago so i'm already in pre-patch chill mode KEKW
[8:06:16] xxoutkastedxx: @subversv you mean 2 weeks LOL
[8:06:17] Kneckt: Cool Ty guys I‚Äôll go back n watch
[8:06:18] unborncow: is this still death jesters?
[8:06:23] Luxicake: @subversv does something change with the raid in s4? im just coming back so kinda outta the loop
[8:06:31] Korupcija_: don't you have skip
[8:06:45] subversv: Luxicake yeah they are gonna make the raid have affixes i guess
[8:06:49] subversv: @xxoutkastedxx exactly LOL
[8:07:05] Zilberg: I wonder how good Paladin tanking will be. Paladins best tank in Shadowlands IMO
[8:07:08] Luxicake: @subversv ohhh interesting
[8:07:21] subversv: Luxicake they are called fated raids

[8:08:11] Rudric_Ice: @SavageGaz ye lvl a tauren rogue
[8:08:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vengeance was the "best" tank for most of Shadowlands
[8:08:28] Zilberg: Paladins been strong all expansion though LUL
[8:08:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is, Vengeance DH was able to haul ass and kite better, when the tanks were getting chonked

[8:10:45] Foxfire7732: LUL
[8:10:48] LesterLinton: yee the spirts cleave 8 mobs with crash lightning
[8:10:49] Kisswani: KEKW
[8:11:02] joe_g_433: @towelliee how many pulls did jailer end up taking your guild?

[8:11:35] Mitune: The Alpha wolf talent that causes it apparently doesnt work atm on alpha
[8:11:39] Wcvechten: You seen the plate pvp sets yet?
[8:11:40] Joefoshow15: enhance can now use lasso as well...a good gap closer imo @Towelliee
[8:11:43] BlewGamingGroup: enhancement is looks sexah af
[8:11:46] Zilberg: I'm glad they aren't making the next expansions raiding so fucking miserable
[8:11:50] Odd3ty: Ugh, why is dractyr same class color as monk.. monkass
[8:12:02] baZleicious: What tank is feeling the best so far in Alpha?
[8:12:06] Nerendis: That‚Äôs pretty fucking high ranked bro. Grays.
[8:12:08] Rodorann: @mackieeswe it seems every week on tues day they will release new spec trees
[8:12:09] Mitune: its slightly darker akctually @Odd3ty Kappa
[8:12:11] Nerendis: Grats
[8:12:25] SurelyBaked: i pretty much gave up on CE for this patch, so many guilds rotted away from this xpac and even this patch it's too much work to maybe kill it lol
[8:12:33] DiiscoViking: oh shit I have alpha, doing the install now cant wait
[8:12:44] Zilberg: I think they should change the class color for sure
[8:12:49] OrganicJKW: @Odd3ty Monk and Evoker are quite a few shades apart. When you see the colors together, it's very obvious.
[8:13:10] LesterLinton: you got it just now Disco?
[8:13:25] fokeriser: @SurelyBaked i did that but before 9.3 started KEKW
[8:13:26] Zilberg: monkaS

[8:27:45] DishChi: So professions will be more important?

[8:28:55] jesseh91: @Zilberg theres about 7 now
[8:28:56] Ghostopheles: if you really wanted to be thorough, you could compare damage before and after new talents
[8:28:59] Rudric_Ice: SPOILERS DansGame
[8:29:07] Zilberg: They need more jesseh91 LUL
[8:29:20] Nerendis: I think that dialogue is just an old build. Literally 1 person has created this.

[8:30:03] dyslexican1: several is 5-7 at least
[8:30:06] ChieveMoe: i think 7 or more all the time
[8:30:06] moa285: .. but it sure feels like it.
[8:30:07] moistbuthardbread: @Towelliee less than a decade
[8:30:07] Molvonos: Couple is 2, a few is 3, several is generally five or mroe.
[8:30:08] UlsterFarl: 3+ less than 10
[8:30:11] Jack_the_Dipper: But I think it coems from the word '78'
[8:30:13] CousinAvi86: couple = 2, few =3, several 4+ ??
[8:30:14] Jack_the_Dipper: 7
[8:30:16] bc_23_: couple is 3 and few is 3 or more
[8:30:16] ninedraft317: 4 plus
[8:30:16] BloomsCrux: actual definition is "more than 2 but not many" lol
[8:30:20] BigJustin26: Anduin gonna come back as Manduin with a beard
[8:30:21] CajunCrusader: We were part of the Thanos snap!
[8:30:21] elchaposkjelbo: Cheers sylvanas, Anduin's crying..
[8:30:22] p_fet: couple = 2 few = 3-4 serveral = 5+
[8:30:23] ninedraft317: 3 is few
[8:30:23] Seerated: Isn't it always "10,000 yrs have passed"
[8:30:25] Rudric_Ice: 5+ is called Fiveral Kappa
[8:30:30] Sarocus: Long enough for Nomi to farm Molten Core for the hammer
[8:30:33] Arbszy: Next time we see Anduin he will be older for sure.
[8:30:43] Anxxius: how is dk tank?
[8:31:05] Daarksyde: insert titanic Rose meme... "it's been 70 years..."
[8:31:05] Keyastaron_: WAIT WAHTTT
[8:31:09] Artenuous: manduin with a beard i can see it
[8:31:11] Nicstar1007: Can you show fullscreen?
[8:31:14] Rudric_Ice: thats cool like the UI
[8:31:17] Sarocus: oh, hell yes!
[8:31:23] Ausboss10: So like 4 specs for BS?
[8:31:25] im_n0t_jezus: sick
[8:31:27] DishChi: Anduin loves Sylvanas ? is it possible?
[8:31:28] moa285: POGGERS
[8:31:29] SurelyBaked: man I'm reaaaally hoping that turns out to be a solid system, looks like it has so much potential to be fun
[8:31:29] Kastarian001: Oh damn nice
[8:31:29] rainydayz247: thats so sickkkk
[8:31:29] Rodorann: ssick
[8:31:33] ChieveMoe: thatss super cool
[8:31:33] Ishva: i think anvil mastery will be first
[8:31:35] jhin0100: this is my second time im watching ur stream i rly like the vibe
[8:31:35] abracka_: anduin disappearing on a self discovering journey? like father like son
[8:31:51] OviTheGray: wonder what tailoring might have
[8:32:02] Meakis: I find it sad they do the small skip like this. They could've done a downtime patch where we go rebuild our cities or something. Raids where we fight the Venture Company for resources to rebuild/renew our cities
[8:32:08] Daarksyde: we will be seeing peeps just pumping their hammer at the anvil for dayyysss
[8:32:10] Kastarian001: Time to play a Dark Iron blacksmith for real
[8:32:20] Ishva: I like it
[8:32:25] ninedraft317: its a time sink like a grind for some people
[8:32:27] DishChi: Dark Iron Dwarf will be cool
[8:32:31] Thoreya: extra content that wow needs pog
[8:32:33] Rudric_Ice: time to play MECHAGNOME
[8:32:56] smashwow: so several is three or more but less than many. and many low end starts around 5-8. but it's all up to the person saying it so who the fuck knows.
[8:32:58] Keyastaron_: 4250 perks
[8:33:03] MeisterPetze: play the addon, not m+
[8:33:19] Daarksyde: new M+ content: professions
[8:33:26] Rudric_Ice: time to grind profession rather than m+  LUL
[8:33:29] smashwow: oh ffs that's the crafting tree?
[8:33:30] Jack_the_Dipper: And in 10.1 they will add more
[8:33:37] smashwow: don't you say AK
[8:33:43] yuvalal: AP?
[8:33:48] OrganicJKW: Morgan Day interview, they said they want Professions to be its own unique pillar or progression, like raiding and M+. This looks great for that.
[8:33:50] smashwow: REEE
[8:33:51] moa285: KEKW
[8:34:01] dyslexican1: I just hope its not timegated. I don;t mind it being a grind but let me grind. Just don;t time gate it
[8:34:03] jaalexba: <APES> will do it in the first 24 hours.
[8:34:03] Rudric_Ice: THD will be happy KEKW
[8:34:11] SurelyBaked: I just want professions to feel like they are relevant and impactful like how they used to be back in the day
[8:34:14] OviTheGray: as a filthy cassual... if i can gear up all my chars with proffesions to a decent ilvl... imma be all over it :)
[8:34:17] Gezber: buy token, get gold, buy item EZ
[8:34:19] blossomcamm: yep
[8:34:22] moa285: I used to like proffesions. :tf:
[8:34:25] DishChi: Crafting for life
[8:34:28] barefoot_on_bricks: agreed @SurelyBaked
[8:34:30] Ishva: @Rudric_Ice hahaha i wsa thinking the same
[8:34:35] Sarocus: Since i dont raid OR do M+, this will be awesome for me
[8:34:36] OrganicJKW: @SurelyBaked Crafting an make BIS gear as well. It'll be very relevant this expansion.
[8:34:40] Rudric_Ice: there you go THD u got your GRIND in DF
[8:34:43] JasperCalico: yet EZ
[8:34:46] Ausboss10: This 50% exp increase is crazy right now
[8:34:49] SurelyBaked: you could buy a wow token and pay someone to craft it for you though couldn't you?
[8:34:51] nixy_nix: that's surprising
[8:34:53] Kastarian001: FFXIV taught me that crafting is lit af, glad to see WoW taking it seriously as a gameplay pillar
[8:34:56] Namorkeil: as long as it's not super material heavy for the recipes like BfA was...
[8:34:57] smashwow: nah but you can pay for the carry to get the mythic pieces to craft your gear Kappa
[8:34:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'll be spending hundreds of hours farming mats and making things, yeah
[8:34:58] blossomcamm: @Gezber not gonna work that way LUL
[8:34:59] SurelyBaked: with that whole work order type system
[8:35:06] itsNODDERS: can i send like a couple of pieces from mythic ilvl to alts ?
[8:35:10] MeisterPetze: going full pvp andy again
[8:35:10] Moobot: Zilberg, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat while we play Lost Ark. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[8:35:13] zero2crazy: wouldnt it be cool if it wasnt soulbound but account bound? @Towelliee
[8:35:22] Nerendis: aren‚Äôt they bop because of the work order thing? @towelliee
[8:35:25] superturkx: Towelliee do you ever see yourself streaming on Youtube?
[8:35:26] daywalker1014: that's p sick
[8:35:31] Zilberg: Banned forever Sadge
[8:35:47] OGXanos: good we need more incentives to go back to 5's after we outgear them
[8:35:49] OrganicJKW: 5
[8:35:51] Gotxiko: @HickoryLIVE still BoE, work orders crafts it for you and binds it to the buyer
[8:35:52] Chiphazzord: 5
[8:35:58] ChieveMoe: How about the auctionhouse?
[8:35:59] smashwow: @HickoryLIVE the raid drops yes
[8:36:00] SurelyBaked: but doesn't that work order system include crafters being able to use their own mats? so technically crafters can farm everything and make stuff for other people for a price still? or maybe i misunderstand that system
[8:36:00] Gotxiko: @HickoryLIVE sorryk bop, misread
[8:36:02] OrganicJKW: Yes, 2h counts as 2.
[8:36:03] MeisterPetze: thats nice
[8:36:05] ThorH13: show be limitless
[8:36:09] ThorH13: should*
[8:36:11] Ghostopheles: it'd be cool if the number of crafted items went up with your crafting knowledge, so crafters could use more of their own gear
[8:36:22] Zilberg: Oh man... Flasks?
[8:36:24] Chiphazzord: so 3 for a furyt warrior
[8:36:26] Ghostopheles: number of crafted items you can wear*
[8:36:28] Zilberg: 6 star flasks Kreygasn
[8:36:34] ChieveMoe: Didnt they have like a stress test for the regionwide change theyre doing?
[8:36:44] Jack_the_Dipper: Second account at the work order and camp it
[8:36:44] ZeroIronSight: LOL
[8:36:47] ChieveMoe: Just havent followed that update as of recent
[8:36:56] Thoreya: wishful thinking the wowtoken doesnt destroy this
[8:37:05] Thoreya: in some way or another
[8:37:07] smashwow: i really hope the WOs have a min gold/tip thing attached to them. otherwise that shit is gonna be useless because crafters wont' fuck with that
[8:37:07] Ishva: nice
[8:37:14] SurelyBaked: correct, but the crafters can still upcharge the shit out of stuff like that i'd think, in theory
[8:37:17] itsNODDERS: any chance it will be account wide?
[8:37:22] Jack_the_Dipper: @Towelliee I think you can even let your bop be upgfraded by a crafter
[8:37:31] MeisterPetze: it will 100%
[8:37:34] SurelyBaked: i don't hold my breath when it comes to crafters upcharging after seeing how the legendary crafting fiasco went this xpac
[8:37:35] MeisterPetze: loot at legos
[8:37:37] Namorkeil: I mean, the wow token means that prices will be through the roof
[8:37:40] Gotxiko: it seems like such an elegant while simple system
[8:37:40] Tzarrus: So that should cut down on the M+ Raid guild gold fests and BoEs
[8:37:43] lithium364: what happens if bots auto accept every contract?
[8:37:54] HaloS23: @Towelliee is gold taken on pick up of work order or receipt of item?
[8:37:55] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[8:37:55] TheRealDeo_: it will almost 1000% interfere. the avg player won't be able to afford it.
[8:37:55] Zilberg: Fuck yes dude
[8:38:04] Chiphazzord: so boosts are teh only way to get the reagent
[8:38:16] smashwow: you can't sell the mythic reagents but you can sell the boosts
[8:38:16] ThorH13: They have Diablo Immortal for there p2w
[8:38:17] Namorkeil: They can't predict how the community will break it though
[8:38:22] leronTTT: just delate token and solve half of the world problems LUL
[8:38:24] Chiphazzord: peeps will token for boosts to get it but its another step
[8:38:26] Jack_the_Dipper: I wonder if those work orders will be limited to the realms that are connected or not because of the  AH that will now be region-wide
[8:38:27] danielthegathering: how can they not wow token mythics??
[8:38:29] rusty414: bot crafter will have to farm for mats
[8:38:31] SurelyBaked: the only difference is that you spend the money through a crafter instead of on the AH, at least thats my interpretation of it
[8:38:44] Gotxiko: bots would need the mats required to craft it, and they can vary because the buyer puts specific mats, and the bop mats need ot be farmed on dungeons
[8:38:46] itsEllySaurus: Buy token, buy boost or buy drops from raids with the gold. and then place orders
[8:38:47] SurelyBaked: though at least you can craft it yourself too, so you can cut them out if you want
[8:38:49] ThatW0lF: OwO
[8:38:52] Zilberg: Farming for matts is 100% more fun then getting boosted imo
[8:38:55] Ishva: those first crafters to get mythic gear is going to make such bank
[8:39:06] Cryttan: Some individuals with loads of gold will def pay $$$ for work orders just like people now pay loads for max Ilvl BoEs on AH.
[8:39:11] OGXanos: Bots doing Mythic Raids together lmao
[8:39:12] Gotxiko: dungeons would take too much effort and time for bots
[8:39:13] Kloshx: are bots still a thing?
[8:39:15] ThatW0lF: UwU
[8:39:17] ChieveMoe: I would be pissed to see a bot in my dungeon lol
[8:39:20] MrOmegaFuryan: who crafts the biggest bags for inventory?
[8:39:22] danielthegathering: @ep5i always
[8:39:22] Cryttan: @Towelliee  Those type of bots don't exist anymore tho. It's all grinding bots.
[8:39:27] Namorkeil: bots healing in a dungeon...
[8:39:31] aid280: @ep5i theyre rampant in wow
[8:39:33] DishChi: @Towelliee any thoughts on upcoming Amazon LOTR series ?
[8:39:34] Gotxiko: you cant automate a mythic dungeon lol
[8:39:36] smashwow: i'm really concerned with the Work Order Economy. why would a crafter make something if the gold isn't worth it
[8:39:39] lithium364: standard price of 1 wow token
[8:39:39] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[8:39:47] Ghostopheles: seems like an interesting way to make money for RWF
[8:39:47] raldrik: I wonder if the reagents are going to be class/item specific or will it be a godsend for world first so you need less splits
[8:39:54] Jack_the_Dipper: @smashwow Well than you dont make it
[8:39:55] Chiphazzord: so as a community we can all agree 1 copper for crafters
[8:40:03] jersey_steve: I just think about all the Blood of Sargaras I had sitting in the banks of chars who weren't crafters. This system will allow non crafters to get use from that kind of thing.
[8:40:10] trinita299: 1C
[8:40:13] blossomcamm: LUL
[8:40:16] Atem___: so basically wow token will still influence it
[8:40:16] OviTheGray: the BIS items will require bop items that both crafter and player need to have

[8:40:20] Chiphazzord: 1c for mythic craft
[8:40:21] Jack_the_Dipper: @smashwow I don't craft it if isn't profitable. I rather than sell the mmats
[8:40:24] valianya: Mail is Evoker too, high demand
[8:40:24] fokeriser: KEKW
[8:40:28] duhworks: no shot it will be a millon
[8:40:31] Gotxiko: @Towelliee and dont forget that you will be able to limit work orders to friends or guildies
[8:40:32] SurelyBaked: regardless of my concerns I do think it's going to at least be a good system in terms of bringing more importance to crafting
[8:40:34] Samiccus: This is badass and such a welcomed changed. Imagine a dwarf player who just crafts all day in Ironfordge. Fits the lore perfectly
[8:40:39] ThorH13: its worth what theyre willing to spend
[8:40:40] Jack_the_Dipper: The guys at TSM have a lot of work to do LUL
[8:40:42] smashwow: @Jack_the_Dipper agreed which is my point. it just won't get used.
[8:40:43] mavericks312: if you think your getting mythic level gear for anything less then 500k your crazy
[8:40:43] Chiphazzord: bot will just auto do all tehjy can see
[8:40:49] Chiphazzord: reguardless of price
[8:40:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[8:40:52] Ariea_Whisper: Crafters won‚Äôt take bad priced work orders it will be nice
[8:40:53] nilachip: bots FTW
[8:40:58] Shnazmeister: thats the thing tho will it be like expulsom in bfa where the crafter is limited on personal mats
[8:40:59] Atem___: if you dont have gold you will be screwed
[8:40:59] danielthegathering: seems like poor players with little playtime can never get those items
[8:41:02] ChieveMoe: @Jack_the_Dipper true lol
[8:41:03] MrTerkyMan: @smashwow Idk that they would. The benefit of the system is that the person requesting something to be made can front the mats so the crafter just has to pick up the order, hit craft, and then fulfill it and get a tip for the time they put in to get to a point where they can actually make the item
[8:41:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @Towelliee if we go blacksmithing, will we be forced to go mining as well?
[8:41:13] TheRealDeo_: couple hundred usd for one item lmao
[8:41:17] Elseworldz: Ah that's where the token probably comes in. People will ask for a ton of gold, and ordinary players might go "Guess I'm buying tokens to afford it"
[8:41:22] Its_Jackpot: this makes me happy but not only for DF but for future wow expansions too
[8:41:24] Jack_the_Dipper: @smashwow Well you may than have the farmers that will craft them. But yeah you have a point there
[8:41:25] lumaday: What‚Äôs up @jack_the_dipper
[8:41:32] toobaked1987: Have we seen what Engineering has to offer yet?
[8:41:34] SurelyBaked: one step at a time
[8:41:39] Ghostopheles: do you have a 2H sword recipe? I don't have one
[8:41:39] mal_athoth: did you make a video over profession specs?
[8:41:39] darthturtle1031: Is there gonna be some way to like counter offer on the AH?
[8:41:42] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  alot of envoker gatherer bots inc
[8:41:42] sliproach: did gathering proffs get talent trees?
[8:41:45] SurelyBaked: polite nudging KEKW
[8:41:46] Caynn79: Base level mats are going to be dirt cheap with the AH connection \
[8:41:46] ZeroIronSight: lirikPOG
[8:41:48] Jack_the_Dipper: @lumaday SeriousSloth /
[8:41:49] Lemon_King: Just make crafting mats account wide currency.
[8:41:49] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Herbalism/Mining/Skinning should be secondary professions
[8:41:59] OviTheGray: you might need to mine for bop stuff :)
[8:42:00] Milanesa_De_Pollo: TRUE
[8:42:01] SurelyBaked: man that would be such a good change
[8:42:06] tastytictacs: it'd be really cool to just collect all that stuff
[8:42:06] raldrik: that would be amzaing
[8:42:09] Kloshx: totally agree
[8:42:10] jemilork: nah we have so many alts
[8:42:12] Gappopo: YES lol
[8:42:12] SurelyBaked: especially with the dracthyr having those gathering buffs
[8:42:13] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Makes it interactive like New World
[8:42:17] tastytictacs: Gw2 does that, it's so nice
[8:42:18] Caedranos: And more modern, as most other mmos have those basic gathering available to all
[8:42:19] THE_Lesher: it's is in many other mmo's so why not in wow?
[8:42:21] Korupcija_: true and real
[8:42:24] moistbuthardbread: @Towelliee it never made sense to me from an RPG perspective that you couldnt chop wood and mine?
[8:42:30] Jack_the_Dipper: The problem with giving them all will make the prices drop of the economy and you will get deflation. Not sure if we want thast with current token prices
[8:42:30] THE_Lesher: agreed
[8:42:30] Kastarian001: If they do that then at least make the nodes work better
[8:42:32] Cryttan: Adding a separate tree like this for the gathering professions would be my preference.
[8:42:32] Samiccus: @Towelliee basically you want to go full New World professions and gathering and I have np with that
[8:42:32] Architank: Competition for nodes would be rough though haha
[8:42:35] Ghostopheles: or have a gathering profession slot that you can use to pick one of the three, instead of having all three
[8:42:35] kevmimcc: yes please
[8:42:37] sliproach: should give gathering proffs the stat bonus back
[8:42:38] smashwow: @MrTerkyMan yeah but if the price isn't there the board is a ghost town.
[8:42:45] jaderyu: everyone should be able to gather baseline
[8:42:45] Frozentoes_: Being able to do mining, jewelcrafting, and blacksmithing on my main would be so sick
[8:42:48] Chiphazzord: can i craft items for peeps that arent on the ah vs only on the ah
[8:42:59] SurelyBaked: they need to bring the WORLD back in World of Warcraft haha
[8:43:02] fokeriser: noledge YEP
[8:43:06] strchsr: @Towelliee You got two arms you can mine ore or pick flowers
[8:43:06] MightyMight: Metalurgy
[8:43:06] OviTheGray: tbh is hard to pick up herbs :)
[8:43:07] Gotxiko: mining is just a zugzug profession, hit the rock get shiny
[8:43:12] NBK_Sethus: professions should be a whole endgame for people who decide to go deep
[8:43:20] Gotxiko: kobolds can mine, let us mine freely
[8:43:22] Ishva: hahaha
[8:43:23] Rudric_Ice: KEKW
[8:43:26] solsaver12: lol

[8:43:34] dyslexican1: "you will put your eye out!:
[8:43:34] The_Tacozilla: "me no have certificate, me just want to hit rocks"
[8:43:35] Meakis: And then he starts strip mining Elewynn forest
[8:43:36] Rodorann: lol
[8:43:36] Ghostopheles: you'll destroy the rocks, fool! then you'll need 20 rocks to make one useful rock!
[8:43:37] Verdell263: Have you seen my sword?
[8:43:39] Jack_the_Dipper: @Frozentoes_ True but that will make the values drop if you want to make some gold because more will be mass producing
[8:43:39] Dimeric: No! They are minerals!
[8:43:43] Verdell263: Pick ain't nothing
[8:43:45] feydrinpal: understand what u mean but removes demand from others
[8:43:46] Chiphazzord: i use to use rocks to hit peeople is that the same ....justice for the rocks
[8:43:48] feydrinpal: bad thing
[8:43:48] Rudric_Ice: YUM BOOGERS
[8:43:57] Elseworldz: Towelliee eats boogers confirmed.
