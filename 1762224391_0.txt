[2:45:42] George2001k: Can you avoid Azureblade’s frontal slash as a tank?
[2:45:49] drunkenbear1: rip other classes who are not in the meta :(

[2:46:37] picc0: @zkadhI yes
[2:46:38] thalantas123: @George2001k yes with a very long jump -- but the boss moves at the same time you so make your team very sad
[2:46:39] Bl4ckt0wer: @moderatygos k thx

[2:49:51] Andanole: Mage is my main class since 2007
[2:50:03] GllaDy: what a crazy pull
[2:50:05] utopin: mastered the pull they say
[2:50:10] SoftWareWolf: Warrior, Druid, Death Knight, Priest. hmmmmm

[2:50:46] xdyabolical: a what?
[2:50:51] SoftWareWolf: Hmmm I wonder what Devs play
[2:51:04] Deux_wow: plink
[2:51:28] falysae: I still think finishing the Temple once things go semi ok is a good thing. Today you don't want to be eliminated. Even if it's far from perfect, not finishing the key is 45 minutes. Just put a time there...
[2:51:30] terrotopsis: @softwarewolf clearly not shadow priest
[2:52:15] Winnnie: idk they're redoing spriest next patch
[2:52:25] Andanole: @admiraltegetthoff since I was a kid I always loved magic :p
[2:52:31] SoftWareWolf: Ok so it's impossible to balance this game. It's impossible to balance more than 2 classes. Thats why sc was so crazy, and its still not balanced.
[2:52:50] ManlioJorgeGrimaldi: cavern4Strunzooo
[2:52:50] casualzgamer: @Winnnie you mean nerf it ?
[2:52:50] DaBo00: how much time left is there?
[2:52:56] moderatygos: 2 hours 15 minutes left
[2:53:06] SoftWareWolf: But blizz says "some classes are going to ibe better than others in different expansions"
[2:53:09] DaBo00: @moderatygos SeemsGood
[2:53:12] admiraltegetthoff: @Andanole thats nice hehe
[2:53:17] SoftWareWolf: but it's been the same classes every time.
[2:53:19] Winnnie: @Winnnie no they're changing spells and removing things. idk if damage is gonna be different or not
[2:53:36] laqueefa: heck yea cheese got a warlock in there

[2:57:35] 궁전궁전궁전: I hate the camera of the championships.

[2:59:20] Shearin77: @MasterRamen so far he's been rocking the feral druid
[2:59:28] goughw: have dire wolves stopped playing or is the production team just incredibly biased against them?
[2:59:38] moderatygos: teams are adjusting their comps based on dungeons + key level + affixes
[2:59:42] hightestjesus: @MasterRamen mages are played in sbg
[2:59:50] moderatygos: good thing about having a variety is that teams do different things based on the combination
[2:59:54] shinebright42O: @hightestjesus ah okay thanks

[3:03:06] meatiusloaficus: why are these so difficult on 22, there are teams doing 26+
[3:03:25] picc0: @meatiusloaficus cause it's a race
[3:03:36] Shearin77: @meatiusloaficus it's about speed so they take way more risks
[3:03:37] cnc41729: They doing it fast as they can
[3:03:41] MasterRamen: they doing the fastest time. not just clear it i guess
[3:03:46] keinezo: theyre doingi it as fast as possible so theyre doing really risky pulls
[3:03:46] Lylsky: casters cursing Madge
[3:03:47] SoftWareWolf: @meatiusloaficus because its for speed. look how much they are pulling
[3:03:47] moderatygos: there is a lot of pressure on the teams to go as quickly as possibly. they are doing risky pulls that they may not do normally
[3:04:07] moderatygos: the format does not allow for practicing, so these teams are doing science live on stream
[3:04:07] Maxheadspace: how big can they pull without dying?  the unending question
[3:04:42] MasterRamen: want to see ruby fast pull haha
[3:04:52] trexter3000: @Maxheadspace you can pull everything on paper, but can you kill it?
[3:05:20] Maxheadspace: yup
[3:05:28] cnc41729: Echo can
[3:05:50] Kieron_RS: That last pull has a crazy amount of mechanics
[3:06:09] SoftWareWolf: easy boss
[3:06:09] Moobot: Leaderboard: https://rio.gg/MDI2023LSTeams

[3:06:33] Metaphix: weird that feral is good, it's been so bad for years

[3:08:13] strongog: @ChadOrc 5 hours to do 5 dungeons as many pulls as they want. They just have to log their best times in 5 hrs for 5 dungeons
[3:08:18] FeniksHS: echo in time trails had 12:29 (21)

[3:08:49] ChadOrc: @strongog thanks
[3:08:54] melkisel: @ChadOrc Not sure if you're trolling or not. But AV stands for Azure Vault (Dragonflight dungeon), not for Alterac Valley.
[3:09:00] Maxheadspace: Cheese  BibleThump
[3:09:01] picc0: @cnc41729 ye on different key level and affixes
[3:09:04] hightestjesus: @FeniksHS Sang is really painfull here, but they can go much faster than 1630
[3:09:04] moderatygos: echo is a very good team, so naturally people will compare
[3:09:09] GarrettVG: what races are the 4 warriors
[3:09:13] cnc41729: They are putting in there times just cause they can echo is
[3:09:19] MasterRamen: Everyone will compare with echo. they the world champion 5x
[3:09:22] EzzLyfe: @Elhanna because these teams will eventually have to beat Echo if they want to win
[3:09:23] Kieron_RS: I preferred the old scoreboard :(
[3:09:33] strongog: @ChadOrc np any other questions? maybe i have the answer
[3:09:46] Supcore: why are they not adding 45 min default until they have a time?
[3:10:13] Winnnie: 2 hours remaining

[3:24:57] blasern1: Only Ruby,cos and hov left ? on the random map for tomorrow?
[3:25:11] insulinbandit93: @taylors09 what do u mean?
[3:25:13] moderatygos: @blasern1 yep
[3:25:17] RunawayXcon: so for today you just dont want to be last - right? what's the benefit of being 1st vs 2nd
[3:25:22] cnc41729: 15 hours
[3:25:38] moderatygos: today you just don't want to be eliminated
[3:25:42] moderatygos: tomorrow you want to be top 2
[3:25:43] Elhanna: That's a rough reset forr Legendary
[3:25:47] falysae: @RunawayXcon TOday nothing. Tomorrow you go to the global finals
[3:25:48] Thomas_Huayra: @RunawayXcon being in pole position tomorrow
[3:25:49] Shearin77: @rapp87 1h45m  left to start again

[3:27:39] spat0n: lol
[3:27:53] cnc41729: It’s alright fr looks hard you know its tilting
[3:27:55] SuveraLive: plonk
[3:27:58] Thomas_Huayra: Thunderstruck play safe on first pull, but then they do that
[3:28:05] miscxnduct: doggoArrive
[3:28:20] insulinbandit93: @taylors09 sad. Was thinking about gearing my sp :(  But is the dmg still okay?
[3:28:23] Thomas_Huayra: wait.. thunderstruck not resetting
[3:28:31] bmillybmilly: if dire wolves has a rogue why dont they use it on AA?
[3:28:39] moderatygos: sp is really strong, but it is getting changes on the 10.1 ptr at least
[3:28:41] spat0n: @taylors09 i liked CoPSP in WoD
[3:28:47] fashion_derg: ooof
[3:28:47] falysae: @Thomas_Huayra That's smart. At this point, just finish a dungeon so you have it
[3:28:48] cnc41729: I think cheese and legendary has already won
[3:28:53] taylors09: @insulinbandit93 idk about numbers, numbers can be changed insta. playstly is just so bad
[3:29:26] AbieCherry: does the companion app works for this ?
[3:29:40] AbieCherry: or the thing to check talents
[3:29:45] goesidd: thunder dc?
[3:29:48] kiyoix: plink
[3:29:49] Shearin77: @cnc41729 cheese needs to put a time on the board though
[3:30:12] cnc41729: They still have 2 hrs though
[3:30:33] DaBo00: Legendary took over 1st spot? HahaReindeer or is it because Cheese hasn't gotten a time on TJS yet?
[3:30:38] insulinbandit93: @taylors09 maybe they will change something too. It´s still ptr and a month away
[3:30:40] falysae: Exactly. The casters have said that too. These teams all need to finish the dungeon once. Just pu t a time there. The pressure will only increase if you do not
[3:30:43] Shearin77: @cnc41729 true and i believe but they have been at it for a while
[3:31:13] moderatygos: they have about 1 hour 38 minutes left to start a new dungeon, it is so important to get a time in tjs today
[3:31:15] cnc41729: They are liquid trust me they going make it
[3:31:18] Shearin77: @DaBo00 yes that's why
[3:31:34] EzzLyfe: @cnc41729 who is?
[3:31:34] Stepbrogue: @falysae I mean the dungeon itself is not hard, if they "just want a time" they can just do a normal run at the very end
[3:31:44] cnc41729: Cheese
[3:31:46] Stepbrogue: @falysae But "just doing the key" is likely to get them eliminated either way
[3:32:12] EzzLyfe: @cnc41729 who is from liquid in that team?

[3:33:05] falysae: That's not true at all. Assuming all finish the key badly, the other dungeons will make the difference. Any semi-decent key, even with 10 deaths, could guarantee you qualify to tomorrow
