[4:21:31] Reticent_88: @n3ther It's always 3 targets
[4:21:32] roflnaldo: But non mana spells should just be max damage

[6:18:15] Eclypsaaa: no pet hunter EZ
[6:18:16] Reticent_88: It's awful RNG based tanking too, all about Parry and Dodge
[6:18:19] coldmachinery: @Alleleirauh ooh, thank you
[6:18:20] Alleleirauh: @Alleleirauh adds a bunch of content
[6:18:39] zeast66: it like pos4 AM it fun
[6:18:42] wolfenbolt: Warlocks did tank in vanilla, but it was only ranged/magic bosses
[6:18:44] mittuot: @reticent_88 is block not RNG LUL
[6:18:53] YourKingCrowley: in practice, giving people more flexibility in tanking increases ammount of people playing dungeons and overral game is better
[6:19:01] EMCQable: going in circles monkaS
[6:19:11] EMCQable: time to die of thirst in an unknown land
[6:19:13] walk1ngpanda: ono no america gun
[6:19:19] Alleleirauh: @YourKingCrowley Wasnt the point of classic to return to classic tho
[6:19:30] nulladdict: no gun-fu sajj
[6:19:31] Runescrye: Warlock tank was in like 1 gimmick boss in vanilla.
[6:19:32] YourKingCrowley: well its a season of discovery
[6:19:56] onlyfansing: LOL
[6:19:58] Reticent_88: Then play Cata or retail
[6:20:01] LNReader: KEK
[6:20:04] Zaionara_: @Runescrye warlock was tank in 2 endgame bosses in BC
[6:20:06] Alleleirauh: I suppose it remains to be seen whether it works, but im sceptical
[6:20:10] Meriveo: YEPP
[6:20:17] sea_fishu: everyone is pos12345
[6:20:22] Zephiris26: They will play tank twice, and then remember that they are still tanking :)
[6:20:26] S_H_O_D_A_N: yeah, either make the role distinct, or have everyone be DPS
[6:20:33] DrunkLoliOgre: we don't even need that, they just need to fix Prot Paladin being garbage and buff feral tanking
[6:20:34] Ieetz0rR_: Mage healer is more hype tbh
[6:20:39] kimchip0p: LOL
[6:20:39] Runescrye: @Zaionara_ Yeah, I remember BC had a few, but I don't remember more than AQ one in vanilla
[6:20:50] DonPigeon: is he dismissing because otherwise it would go around and aggro the world?
[6:20:51] zeronjk: idk its more fun having specific classes so people have to play together
[6:20:52] Alleleirauh: @Ieetz0rR_ Thats just priest tho
[6:20:53] Zaionara_: @Runescrye Yea vanilla youre right
[6:20:59] half4wake: what happened to doge
[6:21:17] ButtobiBoop: you have to choose your roles so that won't happen most likely
[6:21:27] YourKingCrowley: i think new season releases in a week, so we will see if im right
[6:21:28] Nightbot: Also live streaming now on Youtube for those that prefer it! https://www.youtube.com/@WehSing/streams
[6:21:33] zbzzzzzzzzzt: Wheres tiger dog?
[6:21:34] m3wk: There was a massive issue with finding tanks in vanilla classic. Tanks were just asking 100g to tank dungeons for other people.
[6:21:48] ButtobiBoop: yeah homoginisation is a real fear
[6:21:50] Zycte_: @half4wake replace after we got the owl sadE
[6:21:52] MaciejWojton: i dont care about p2w games, i just dont play them
[6:21:54] ButtobiBoop: but I think the way they do it now they are not heading towards it
[6:22:00] ButtobiBoop: they only added a couple more options
[6:22:11] Runescrye: 100g? I remember charging 400g for MC runs with drops, but never encountered a tank charging for a dungeon
[6:22:13] ButtobiBoop: ffxiv actually suffers from the thing you mention sing
[6:22:14] ygg_druid: Bussin Bober
[6:22:18] iHeckinLovePuns: !castlevania: Aria of Sorrow
[6:22:19] Skwishi: iHeckinLovePuns has caught a fish called the abc1ndy for 16 angler points. OOOO
[6:22:22] ButtobiBoop: all tanks are the same, in ffxiv
[6:22:26] BayStreetSix: lock tank is one thing, but rogue?
[6:22:32] abc1ndy: OOOO wtf
[6:22:33] Zycte_: !castrate chat's pp

[6:22:42] YabeDaimyo: warlock tanks was a rare thing in bc and wotlk
[6:22:43] salazarivan: I like the sound of mage healer/offhealer
[6:22:46] nulladdict: that’s a huge fish MMMM
[6:22:50] ButtobiBoop: ffxiv focuses a lot on casualisation so thats their reasoning I think
[6:22:50] Zaionara_: If one role like tank is so scarce its fine to give it to more classes
[6:22:51] sea_fishu: sounds like lost ark KEK
[6:22:56] ButtobiBoop: it works cause the mmo is huge now
[6:22:57] walk1ngpanda: true
[6:22:59] Reticent_88: Huh? MCH is nothing like any caster. It had a little similarity during Heavensward about 8 years ago
[6:23:03] Alleleirauh: casualisation ruined retail wow no?
[6:23:03] righteousjam: FF14 dps is just playing dance-dance-revulution with different costumes
[6:23:06] Runescrye: The real problem with tanks was that feral and paladin were not really viable

[6:23:16] akakaweis: BBoomer
[6:23:22] Reticent_88: Ah, sure then KEK
[6:23:24] Fourfai: i mean they could just fix paladin on vanilla then there would be 2 tanks class
[6:23:27] kenlee1212: oh hell yea searing gorge my favorite xd
[6:23:35] ButtobiBoop: ffxiv dps play different right now at least, but tanks and healers are all the same
[6:23:36] Runescrye: Though horde don't have paladins
[6:23:39] Reticent_88: Jobs are a lot more unique now. Except some tanks and healers can feel a little similar to each other in ways, for balance reasons
[6:23:40] sethwild: WoW has one of the best class mechanics back when it was first released
[6:23:40] iHeckinLovePuns: !roll bad joke if Nat20
[6:23:40] Skwishi: iHeckinLovePuns has rolled a 13
