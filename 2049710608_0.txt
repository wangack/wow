[0:10:08] sunileif: 69 hr strum?
[0:23:05] Xzion129: How is unholy DK rn? Want to come back to retail and they sound fun
[0:23:07] sunileif: wooooo 69 hr stream!
[0:23:30] sunileif: how many subs for a subathon 2.0
[0:23:51] sunileif: D;
[0:23:54] WagwanBombaClatBomba: yep
[0:24:07] Anhak: agreed time to reroll hunter for hardcore AWC Pog
[0:25:24] Anhak: Man if rogues actually get HaT gonna be so broken..
[0:25:30] Anhak: in sod..
[0:25:55] Anhak: if it is 1 second hat
[0:25:59] americanmoses18: oh i tought my sound was broke music is so low lols
[0:26:10] Anhak: vs combat potency so 20% offhand hit chance 15 energy
[0:26:36] Anhak: which is also good but 1 second cd Hat means you can generate 4 cbp in the time in normally takes u to do 1 sinister
[0:27:19] Anhak: I think if they go to HaT it should be atleast a 3 second cd if not a 5 second cd
[0:27:27] Anhak: it still be rather strong in that set up
[0:27:53] Anhak: combat potency is also pretty nice at 5 probably is close to if not better at 3 hat is still better i think
[0:28:48] Anhak: at 1 HaT is insane. Envenom already hits harder then Evis at 0 armor and Evis traditionally at 60 hits for about 800-900 more then a sinister So every 4 seconds instead of hitting for 1.5 k you hit for 2.5 + with envenom
[0:29:28] Anhak: and then just the extra insane poison damage that rogues have its gonna be insane i kinda dont hope we get that lol
[0:30:02] Anhak: We did get clarifaction on Redirect its going to work kinda like Lock Soul Swap where you suck them in then the next cbp generater gives them back
[0:31:03] Anhak: but tab targeting in classic u lose your cbp on a target anyways
[0:31:08] Anhak: so its really decent
[0:31:20] Anhak: yea u do only get 4 possible
[0:31:34] Anhak: cause it cost you 40 or w.e to get them back
[0:31:58] disquared: !gamble 3000
[0:31:59] StreamElements: disquared won 3000 runes in roulette and now has 2895878 runes! FeelsGoodMan
[0:32:36] Anhak: So the totem boss in BFD
[0:32:48] Anhak: if i swap to totem i lose my cbp on the boss no matter what
[0:33:06] Anhak: so in theory i could redirect abosrb those auto totem then hit boss and probably gain them back
[0:33:17] Anhak: so it has some aplications or just straight up like 5 cbp evis or something
[0:33:44] Anhak: its just wierd cause cbp work so poorly i guess is the best way to say it in classic/vanilla
[0:34:11] Anhak: in vanilla yes
[0:34:19] Anhak: tbc made it where it kept the cbp
[0:34:57] Anhak: yea so while it does seem kinda bad/not great its much better then pressing tab and just losing cbp
[0:35:10] sunileif: !gamble all
[0:35:10] StreamElements: sunileif went all in and lost every single one of their 10077750 runes LUL

[4:57:39] rembrandt89: did you see bicmex’s games
[4:57:41] dawsonator171: he dnever swapped it to mvq last game.
[4:58:14] flemshadyx: Bloom ticks faster when you have one on yourself
[4:58:50] rembrandt89: those games were fun to watch I thought the ww sub team was something different

[4:59:24] dawsonator171: depending on your haste it's 1 or 2 extra ticks of lifebloom, it's super min maxy
[4:59:51] Solushun: oh no i got tier helmet for my ele ffs
[5:00:53] rembrandt89: someone was saying luxia hasn’t played a whole lot of Druid lately
[5:01:38] rembrandt89: I wonder why he wouldn’t want to play pres into this mirror
[5:02:49] cjdtv: i thought jamie used to play dk
[5:02:57] flemshadyx: Well I mean 20% increased tick rate on all periodic heals from keeping up a bloom on yourself is pretty big
[5:03:09] flemshadyx: I do however think he is using his clearcasts bad
[5:03:24] dawsonator171: did mvq make b roadcast?
[5:03:27] Cybernytez: swapxy can actually play DK as well
[5:03:29] rembrandt89: swapxys team would probably just play rogue after first game
[5:05:12] rembrandt89: mvq’s team only a 3 man roster?
[5:05:51] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[5:05:58] dawsonator171: what is this number next to his arena frames?
[5:05:58] Mazuii: Are you playing a vod in the bg?
[5:07:27] flemshadyx: @dawsonator171 it displays the amount of healing from hots, so he knows which target could be vulnurable for a swap
[5:07:45] rembrandt89: it’s been a while now
[5:07:48] sharpdressedman15: long time ago

[5:14:49] fuseton: i’m pretty sure  they played w rsham/evoker , that’s why . But whaz team is just also better players , that’s why they win . not cuz they should
[5:14:56] Yoskexz: who won this 1

[5:24:13] rembrandt89: there was a feral dev team actually on eu today I think

[7:09:22] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[7:09:25] dawsonator171: I almost specced blood for a game or 2 tbh.
[7:09:29] Solushun: u shouldve played blood ffs
[7:09:32] Solushun: i never experienced that
[7:09:49] Solushun: i did double devistation evoker so theres no lengths i wont stoop too low too
[7:09:52] Solushun: except fistweaver
[7:10:28] dawsonator171: I think blood loses value with dh and rdruid. sustainability of those classes you're looking to fill it isn't needed persay.
[7:11:45] dawsonator171: I think it's good with arms because it struggles to survive outside of a singular defensive and good with WW because they are squishy, however, my opinion could be completely inaccurate.

[7:20:16] doublebrutalhd: tried tips for blood DK, just keep getting trolled by people going afk every shuffle. just had 2 shuffle in a row where a healer just afk in my start room only on my team. and lost 120 rating to blatant win trade. healer comes out and plays 3 rounds against me then just afk my side. two different healers two lobby in a row. how do ytou dodge win traders in this game?  so many people seem to be able to get 2400 in 60 to 100 rounds and seemingly never get trolled

[8:11:25] Solushun: now my tekken que wont even pop wtf is this smh
[8:11:27] happyheals: this dumb enchanting part of the legendary quest bugs out a lot
[8:11:34] happyheals: like 6 times so far
[8:11:47] happyheals: yeah lol
[8:11:54] happyheals: heroic both times
[8:12:06] kklinker: what do you mean it bugs out?!?
[8:12:08] happyheals: just was very lucky
[8:13:26] happyheals: during a part of the questline where you will have to channel an item and a interactable box appears to click a random awakened element to use 10 from your bag
[8:13:41] kklinker: I’m aware of the quest
[8:13:53] kklinker: are you doing in the middle of vald or something?
[8:13:58] sunileif: haveothers catch it
[8:14:17] sunileif: i had 3 guildies catch em for me took 5 mins
[8:14:18] happyheals: sometimes clicking the item it will say you haven't learned that and it dissapears, or it will just dissapear after it appears
[8:14:24] kklinker: isolate yourself ( I went to the top tower of the inn ) so that it couldn’t target anyone but myself.
[8:14:25] sunileif: well 5 times
[8:14:32] sunileif: not mins the cd is 5 mins
[8:14:47] sunileif: then trade em the mats
[8:14:51] kklinker: it probably hopped to random people depending where you were at.
[8:15:01] happyheals: I am just doing it to fill time, I am at 80%
[8:15:27] happyheals: but sharing my issues so people might see it for when they do it
[8:15:50] kklinker: but my point is: where are you doing it?
[8:16:08] kklinker: I don’t think it’s buggin out rather going to the closest body of you pressing it.
[8:16:18] happyheals: the bug happens in valdraaken if i click it
[8:16:23] kklinker: then it just goes on CD and some random has the de if
[8:16:26] happyheals: so maybe it hops to someone like you said
[8:16:44] kklinker: so the inn   fly up there.
[8:16:55] happyheals: yeah like it goes on 5 min cd and i dont get to do the awakened
[8:16:57] kklinker: doesn’t target anyone. and you’re good to go. fly down to the AH
[8:17:01] kklinker: go back up.
[8:17:04] happyheals: ah ok
[8:17:17] happyheals: others i just did wherever and there were no peeps
[8:17:26] kklinker: not the 2nd floor. but like the actual tower part of it
[8:18:00] kklinker: I didn’t have an issue for the 20 I had to do.
[8:18:12] kklinker: other than it taking forever.
[8:18:55] happyheals: apparently just don't do it around people in valdraaken
[8:19:00] ricopal: one day mes :)
[8:19:16] kklinker: yup yup.
[8:20:37] thunderstud25: windwalker Ken?? the latest Warcraft themed Ken doll??
