[0:54:27] ripinpeace10: halfway through my ban bean ! @Bean
[0:54:33] COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY: i'd argue hunters and ferals are more op
[0:54:38] eazycx: they have too much control for sure. it will always be like that
[0:54:42] cumbananas: they have 3 dps specs so atleast 1 spec being good is very likely
[0:54:52] doofeeneed: vanish cheapshot and kidney just the best
[0:54:58] awfulist: KEEP IN MIND the Rog and Dh dev is the SAME PERSON (Realz)
[0:55:00] bonziatv: they will still find something to complain about tho
