[0:31:25] Teokin: I don't think that's necessarily true. I think one of the reasons that your stream does so well is because you take it seriously and actually work towards cultivating your community and leveraging it the right way to monetize it for what you are passionate about.  It's so badass when you do WoW content like the mak'gora tourney because everyone gets to see how badass you are then they come here and join in the xaryu crew.

[1:56:12] 209tomcat: just wait til GMs come back
[1:56:13] taylorsdank: @meatbe4t its been proven they dont make moeny off of them
[1:56:15] VonShank: those accounts create revenue for the company why ban them when they are making money for the company?

[1:56:19] miciahclay: @ScryerTV less demand for gold buying, so the botters don't spend their time there
[1:56:19] Teokin: they need to take away the wow token sub for classic playtime
[1:56:20] nikola420tesla: They are not trying, they do public relations.  They dont want to spend money reducing the amount of subs they get.  Its all money.
[1:56:21] berserage95: people act like sod is a new game and blizzard hasnt had 20 years of exp for the game and bots LUL
[1:56:21] giantbuckethead: I think that people don't understand that being able to track and audit every single gold transaction to get behavior in a reliable way just really don't understand the scope of the problem.

[2:00:41] ictoa88: I always watch YouTube

[2:00:41] supraza: tiktok is insane gets shared alot
[2:00:42] PMA_1: and kick
[2:00:42] Zarce: Splitting the community
[2:00:42] ithecon: Can‚Äôt interact with all chats
[2:00:42] Jubilation12: i used to do that
[2:00:43] SghettiBoy: you should - Youtube has better bitrate
[2:00:43] CygnusC: divided audience
[2:00:44] anteskoog: multiple chats
[2:00:44] supraza: tiktok will blow up
[2:00:44] UnholyShine: there is no down side to it?
[2:00:45] 209tomcat: AD REVENUE xarPrayge xarPrayge xarPrayge xarPrayge
[2:00:46] dadbanger1: dont forget kick BatChest
[2:00:46] ii_poncho_via_ii: having to interact w 3 chats could eb a pain imo
[2:00:47] eippa97: more monny
[2:00:48] Thomasdurso: no downside
[2:00:48] Azghaz: You should srsly
[2:00:48] koboldjk: yes youtube is a good shout also
[2:00:48] TheRatPresident: the downside is spreading your viewership, potentially reducing twitch viewership which will be your main income
[2:00:49] AmanceG: splits ur community
[2:00:50] Neshama14: 100% Xar you should do that, feels like that's the future
[2:00:50] Jubilation12: @ithecon yes you can.
[2:00:50] g1oom__: some streamers said it divided audience too much
[2:00:51] DeathToad007: can be partnered isnt it?
[2:00:51] R7SOKA: Ludwig says it "fractures communities" but im not educated on the topic
[2:00:51] SupaDeGraz: instagram and facebook too
[2:00:52] oopoop1134: to hard to read 3 chats*
[2:00:53] sjokoLAD: not really a down side, u can get a combined chat and just pew pew more moneys
[2:00:53] MarkyOchoa: that's alot of bandwidth
[2:00:54] Alta_Ergo: 3 chats would be hard keep up with
[2:00:54] Seek_Seek_Lest: I was unaware ticktock had live I must be so damn out of touch XD
[2:00:54] The_RightTwix: Its always been possible, you can stream to dozens of services as long as your system and infrastructure can handle it
[2:00:56] CoolTV: <3
[2:00:58] ithecon: @supraza It hasn‚Äôt already?

[2:01:08] Sowiloo: adge
[2:01:08] FZanix: The downside is you need to use something like restream which hurts the quality or need to have a beefy enough PC to encode 3 streams at once.
[2:01:08] daigurren2: downside  is that chats are split so the interaction becomes confusing
[2:01:09] ShutrMcGavin: I thought partners weren't allowed to stream on multiple platforms
[2:01:10] UnholyShine: more money coming in from it
[2:01:11] xBONGLORDx: just popout all chats onto 1 screen simple
[2:01:11] Jubilation12: @1shabbymn u can tho. there are apps to put them all into one chat.

[2:03:31] subbyye: @Xaryu First offence of rmt = 2 week ban. 2nd = perma ban

[2:03:32] daigurren2: @Xaryu if you did that people would just buy gold for other people to get them banned

[2:03:33] stronhammer: Soda should of been banned
[2:03:34] GordyW: agree
[2:03:34] jkuup: @Xaryu ban soda
[2:03:34] JROOOOOCCC: Absolutely still would buy. If I get perma banned that‚Äôs prolly a good life outcome.
[2:03:35] Ripoylaj: What about Deathrolls for over hundreds of gold???
[2:03:35] raddei: but theyve never done that ever
[2:03:37] bloodmana: 1% chance i could get permabanned..... Im not doing it
[2:03:37] Dinomight3: they should circulate fate ban images
[2:03:38] Spikeqc: banning players harms blizzard tho
[2:03:39] bogieXD: CHEATING SHOULD BE PUNISHABLE BY LAW
[2:03:41] Wulf760: @Xaryu just use a burner account
[2:03:42] Jam103114: They need to start enforcing
[2:03:44] TheMysticBean: @gambleragain But isnt your dummy account sending it over/trading with your main account? lol.
[2:03:44] Dimpleshift: @Xaryu Gotta launder your dirty bought gold on a burner and send it to your main clean
[2:03:46] Alta_Ergo: but they'd have to have like a hall of shame displaying who they perma banned
[2:03:46] limburgse: what does RMT means?
[2:03:46] gambleragain: @Xaryu I've had 4 dummy accounts banned but not my main. ENjoying the gold.
[2:03:47] lurker_0o: The price of gold went up today
[2:03:50] fellifell: but my homie in China always hooks me up with gold ‚Ä¶ that would be bad for me!
[2:03:50] doctor_anoos: shoulda perma banned sodapoppin. they fucked up hugely by not.
[2:03:51] pitviiper: @incognito_enjoyer BabyRage
[2:03:52] samm8te: banned over my christmas holidays lol bastards
[2:03:52] boomer_gamer69: its hard to find out whos buying gold. Alot of people are using the auction house to buy gold. They put items on AH and then the gold selles buy it out. so its hard to proof it that its buying in that form
[2:03:52] NearSingularity: blizzard should have a token then, expecting people with limited time to grind for gold is ridiculous
[2:03:54] bigsteve1015: peepoRiot
[2:03:56] lyarnith: I got banned for selling gold mate @Xaryu
[2:03:58] H_9_K: Blizzard PROFITS from botting though, they won't change. They've had 20 years to deal with this. They don't care
[2:04:02] spardzy1: banning actual players harms the community, need to ban gold sellers because inflation will still not be fixeed if you ban the buyers....
[2:04:03] sheepown: yeah i dont do anything like that. after you lost title in tbc due to your partner i also nearly faced a 6 month ban for my partner doing shady shit.  its not worth it when faced with the risk.   i stopped playing with that guy for that reason
[2:04:05] boomer_gamer69: if your using mail or traiding its easier to get caught
[2:04:05] The_RightTwix: They need to have an offense tier system so you don't punish first time offenders who may not know the rules
[2:04:07] gorglinz: hardcore gonna be a goldmine for botters
[2:04:10] danny_dvd: I got a 10 day ban for telling idiot afkers in WSG to stop afking... U call someone an idiot and it automatically bans you.
[2:04:12] 1shabbymn: The GDKP ban is a step in the right direction at least
[2:04:16] gambleragain: @TheMysticBean Nope. Cause they're not gonna risk banning innocent secondary receivers.
[2:04:22] Greenfreak91: @lyarnith deserved
[2:04:28] stronhammer: Just because X profits from Gold accounts...doesn't mean they aren't profiting long term
[2:04:29] doctor_anoos: @lyarnith deserved
[2:04:31] Hielloz: gnome bis
[2:04:32] Phav: remember you used to do this in wotlk av
[2:04:33] caravainilla: Average horde IQ
[2:04:33] spardzy1: if you dont fix the inflation then legit players have no option but to buy gold, entry level is wayyyyy too high
[2:04:33] kindaopmusic: damnnnnnn
[2:04:33] niigghtmare34: @1shabbymn that just makes more people buy old lol

[3:17:26] Tehfka: what dungeon is hordies running to start?
[3:17:27] mini1mage: arcane blast works great still
[3:17:28] miciahclay: AB is still good
[3:17:28] Craigumander: @Xaryu not sure, you were doing 4hp heals in stocks
[3:17:30] MONNlBLAST: mage healer is fine, just not the booster mage

[3:17:39] CerealKiller_HS_: @xaryu hope you‚Äôre doing well brother! what‚Äôs your input on druid balance for p2 (in pve)? in pvp they will own obviously
[3:17:44] Salionus: @Deomas11 wrong
[3:17:47] rambojimmy: are you innvited to pvp tournament or will you cast it? @Xaryu

[3:18:29] enigmasvea: makes perfect sense for pvp ya, good they realised it was op
[3:18:31] Philopinos: dw we gona get a massive ST heal that only costs 43% mana !
[3:18:32] Madmaxx777: Makes me sad too, I just don't want all the power budget spent on that alone. I think you can buff other aspects of mage without leaving thei niche as "i solo the dungeon in one pull." Hoping they can help pvp flesh out with other runes
[3:18:41] MyOpiate: PVP > PVE
[3:18:44] dominickj821: clip this so when deep freeze comes out we play it back lul

[3:19:08] KralkenG: cope
[3:19:17] NosfeRAtu0202: is BFD spameable in P2? or just 1 per day
[3:19:19] CerealKiller_HS_: what‚Äôs your input on druid balance for p2 (in pve)? in pvp they will own obviously

[3:19:49] Sckarr1337: yeah, i feel like the the target with LF should give you full effect as before, but any mobs getting hit by the trail should only give the 5-7 heal
[3:19:49] WeinerCleaner23: sounds like someone needs a visit from the cuddle bug
[3:19:50] Yodamoo: I can do pvp...but I'm not good at it lol
