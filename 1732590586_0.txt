[3:53:05] Spinecloud: Not bad but blood dk is top now
[3:53:51] 1llum1n471: When I started watching Towelliee 13 years ago, I only played DPS specs
[3:54:05] 1llum1n471: Now I level every tank, every xpac. lol
[3:54:45] Spinecloud: Back then it was so much easier to find a tank spot because of 10 man raids 🥹
[3:55:13] 1llum1n471: Truth
[3:55:50] Spinecloud: I actually miss 10 man. Maybe I’m a minority in that. Felt more intimate
[3:57:13] ThorH13: TEHURN!!!!
[3:57:15] Molvonos: Nothing prevents you from doing 10-man Normal/heroic raids.
[3:57:26] Molvonos: They scale.
[3:57:37] Spinecloud: True. But no mythicie mode
[3:58:01] Molvonos: There's never been a 10-man mythic mode though.
[3:58:06] 1llum1n471: It's not the same though
[3:58:19] Molvonos: Not the same?  Why?
[3:58:24] Spinecloud: Heroic it was called back then
[3:58:28] veryhairyheyyall: towComfy
[3:58:48] Molvonos: Heroic is heroic, it never had the difficulty or tuning that Mythic has now.
[3:59:15] Spinecloud: Heroic back in say…panda land. Was mythic
[3:59:20] Molvonos: It wasnt though
[3:59:23] KaisenSiru: anniesRIP
[3:59:44] Molvonos: That's just a strawman people use to try and justify the creation of a 10-man mythic.
[4:00:40] 1llum1n471: There's no need to
[4:01:00] Molvonos: Yea, sincerely doubt they'll give themselves the headache of trying to balance a 10-man mythic alongside a 20-man
[4:01:05] Penzeera: On a pony and a dream... I love it
[4:01:09] Molvonos: There's just no reason, lol
[4:01:22] 1llum1n471: And even back then, there was incentives to expand into 25man, just because the loot level was higher
[4:01:51] Spinecloud: I remember the good ol days when dream paragon ruled the 10 man
[4:02:02] Molvonos: lol.
[4:02:48] 1llum1n471: And Ensidia screwed themselves in 25 man
