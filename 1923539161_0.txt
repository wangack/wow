[1:44:24] drusiladras: do satchel 14 after 12 as it saves a return trip
[1:44:40] DunzoCD: i love DF but i wish there was a bit more side stuff, like bfa had islands, warfronts, etc
[1:44:55] ArcaneMaki: better vaping than meth, that's how I see it.
[1:45:01] sevenub: bfa was amazing
[1:45:09] zysmos: there is no grinding content so i'm off the game pretty quickly in a season
[1:45:11] ShinoaKurisu: 73 40 for the way point in dragonblight
[1:45:12] Xara36: did someone just say they wanted things like islands and warfronts
[1:45:15] Xara36: lol what
[1:45:34] mavericks312: @zysmos and that’s there goal to let you play other games
[1:45:39] cipusanx: i rate DF story 3/10. the tbc and vanilla had more interesting story
[1:45:45] Bayne77: i think theres a little bit in between vaping and meth...
[1:45:48] Mellottman: @sollowjp are those the only options?
[1:45:48] SamuraiWillZ916: when is the what if patch?
[1:45:53] Molvonos: @cipusanx lol.  I mean, you're entitled to your opinion, but what a take.
[1:45:57] DamaarDK: I like the incarnates, theyre shaping up to be good well written villains

[1:46:05] cipusanx: dragons, the apex beasts felt like rando mobs
[1:46:11] Hikh_17: what happened to stream intros back in BFA
[1:46:16] cptrogers123: Depressing for those who only play wow Sadge
[1:46:17] Shrenko: I love DF because there is so much farming besides player power like collecting stuff, achievements etc
[1:46:18] mavericks312: @cipusanx your entitled to your opinion even if it is wrong
[1:46:33] zysmos: Not saying the story is bad i just find that they've not really been able to increase the stakes there is a lack of tension i find
[1:46:38] denflup: we need more grind, a lot of the playerbase likes grinding, but some vocal minority dont
[1:46:38] snake_like: vanilla...story?
[1:46:44] Rudric_Ice: @cipusanx i agree df story is really bad but who actually cares about wow's stroy anyways lol
[1:46:45] ShinoaKurisu: and fyrakk being a good just overall psychopath of a villian
[1:46:52] Molvonos: @cipusanx You also, apparently, don't remember how many non-apex raid boss dragons we killed in both of your examples.
[1:46:53] TweektheProphet: one is hord one alliance
[1:47:31] cipusanx: ofc I am, played since warcraft 3 and I can say that the dragons in this expansion do not feel scary...the vanilla ones were done way better
[1:47:34] pikwi406: I like the story but I feel like the cutscenes and the voice acting is so.... obvious and over dramatic. "i will NOT fail again.." idk its so cheesey. the lowest hanging fruit
[1:47:52] ArcaneMaki: @Mellottman Well sadly that's what I thought? You mean there are other options? XD
[1:47:58] Maruika: not a mastermind like the jailer
[1:47:58] mavericks312: He is just a psycho crackhead
[1:48:04] Rudric_Ice: what is shadowflame another void thing ?
[1:48:08] KingSlayerYotam: My biggest group with the story is, again, we have no idea about the end goal. Seems like even blizz doesnt know and just makes stuff up along the way
[1:48:34] pronkk_: its at the end
[1:48:35] snake_like: You'll see it
[1:48:40] OhNoNotAgain: It will be at the end
[1:48:41] BoezIRL: a the end
[1:48:47] Molvonos: Yep
[1:48:47] Padraigah: It appears beside you at the end when it dismounts you
[1:48:52] ArcaneMaki: Can we let play the Grizzly Hills music
[1:48:53] karaste: Yes, it has
[1:48:54] DamaarDK: @Towelliee Do u think Iridikron will be the final villain in this expac or will they keep him for the next expac ? he strikes me as a here to stay kinda villain
[1:48:56] DunzoCD: yes lol
[1:49:04] Effin_Steffin: i've never even seen this before lol
[1:49:12] Bayne77: since wrath
[1:49:12] Molvonos: Nah, it was just an easy way to get from one pvp area to the other
[1:49:13] Rudric_Ice: sarkereth was the most shittiest end boss in a raid ever
[1:49:18] mavericks312: @avicenna777 100% he is in 11.0
[1:49:52] Molvonos: He's gotta have his material for trolling.
[1:49:52] snake_like: sarkareth's voicelines were great though. the voice actor is very talented
[1:49:54] mavericks312: Sark > LK as a boss I’ll say it
[1:50:07] DamaarDK: @mavericks312 Yeah I
[1:50:08] MarquisLek: g'huun is the worst boss ever
[1:50:09] Chunky_Brothers: where can i find a list for this
[1:50:20] ArcaneMaki: How do you unlock the puppers?
[1:50:24] DamaarDK: @mavericks312 Id like him to stay as a villain for some more time lol
[1:50:28] Mellottman: This man clearly reviewed ALL bosses before making this statement
[1:50:31] cptrogers123: Denathrius will forever be my favourite end boss @Towelliee
[1:50:38] Bayne77: sarkareth would have been a shitty end of expansion boss, but i get why he was where he was
[1:50:50] Q_TheDreamer: The G'Huun fight mechanics still fuck people that just wanna go on a tmog run
[1:50:57] snake_like: "such delicious knowledge...for those strong enough to seize it..."
[1:51:04] cptrogers123: uhh thats a hot take
[1:51:12] cptrogers123: ohh yea true actually

[2:44:10] Metalcalfe: IMO the 4 piece should give you a free proc of abom limb
[2:44:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the set bonuses should not rely on CD's, it forces you to pick them
[2:44:49] tdpark_: it did , you have to heart strike to apply

[2:46:29] ElmSpace: gets complicated but you could track count of bone shield

[2:57:45] Dcarter: Demo as a whole is a mess
[2:57:56] Molvonos: Good, where it belongs.  In the trash.
[2:58:02] Dcarter: Ouch

[3:01:57] snake_like: I can understand a class not feeling good to play...but yall know warlock has slapped the daylights out of dps for the last 2 years right?
[3:02:15] Molvonos: @Dcarter I just wish they'd stop messing with it all.  I love the idea of Warlocks, always have, but Blizz doing Blizz things.
[3:02:18] Ckraigfriend: and get also  elysian decree
[3:02:23] Ckraigfriend: also reduce your sigils
[3:02:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: We want fire damage and fire damage buffs for DH
[3:02:47] Maydie6066: @Molvonos I've mained a druid since 2005, but was forced into pally this tier and 10.2 i will have to stay a pally.

[3:03:01] 91Niki: Yeah the barber is completely borked. Can't even check out catforms :(
[3:03:03] Dcarter: Yeah they tend to take things that work and then rework them for whatever reason
[3:03:14] Dcarter: I’ll never understand it
[3:03:27] Shrenko: did you see the new combat rework for Throne and Liberty @Towelliee ? https://twitter.com/Julia_CaSsian/status/1701507141620871439 definetly looks alot better
[3:03:29] Ckraigfriend: no
[3:03:42] Molvonos: @Maydie6066 I don't do mythic raiding, so I'm allowed some degree of freedom.  Maybe one day I'll want to play more than one toon, like I used to.
[3:04:02] ElmSpace: Not that high.  The tier has some sigil cdr on its own
[3:04:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they are fixing Throne and Liberty, there's an NDA test up soon
[3:04:20] Dcarter: Or those chocobos

[3:04:40] Maydie6066: @Molvonos I dont want to play multiple toons lol, a dad of 3 working 50 hours a week i barely can keep up with 1 lol. I'm mostly upset that 10.2 is like the druid tier for story and Aestetic and im playing a pal lol
[3:04:44] Molvonos: That dude had guns AND crossbows, what
[3:05:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: ewwwww player collision
[3:05:18] Molvonos: @Maydie6066 I mean, the outdoor set looks hella awesome, so you can get that druid motif easily as an alt character.

[4:04:05] KnsWoW: clip it and ship it boys
[4:04:06] Milanesa_De_Pollo: But why reimplement stuff that was removed if you are simply gonna add the old world back?
[4:04:06] N3llee: classic puriest would have a nuclear meltdown
[4:04:09] Nehcrom: Someone needs to clip this and post on mmo-champion :P
[4:04:13] KnsWoW: ITS HAPPENING!
[4:04:19] joe_g_433: Yea but your character too???
[4:04:20] Rudric_Ice: that would be huge for Warcraft TBH
[4:04:20] luckfore: nah
[4:04:29] Molvonos: Would explain why they tested the waters with Scholo and Naxx.
[4:04:39] motorboatingpro: having the collection menu separate, is what drove me away from classic, to be honest...
[4:04:48] luckfore: patch 1.15 is classic+ it already appeared on the cdns
[4:04:49] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I'm expecting a Tinker from him in retail YEP
[4:04:57] luckfore: they aint adding that to retail LUL
[4:05:06] Plague_GG: Meaning we might be able to finally purify our corrupted ashbringers? COPIUM
[4:05:19] dright424: I could see him advising on the story to make it bit more old school wow feeling
[4:05:23] Rudric_Ice: tow hyping up blizzcon more im loving it
[4:05:32] balerrionhunt: For the transmog, you can only get one piece each week right?
[4:05:34] N3llee: yea retail story is so far past metzen written stories its not even funny
[4:05:35] joe_g_433: They need to just add new content to classic. Like old school rune. Events, new zone?
[4:05:48] Chunky_Brothers: i think they should allow the collections to be one .. id play more classic to gain things nolonger obtainable in retail
[4:05:49] luckfore: its not just the world, its also classes and all the other systems
[4:05:52] kinetico9768: if its just cata announcement then thats not very exciting
[4:05:52] im_n0t_jezus: im sure when they do return to new azeroth he will be a part of that since most of lore he was there for it
[4:05:55] luckfore: that made classic great
[4:05:57] Milanesa_De_Pollo: People be thinking that Steve and Metzen are enemies
[4:06:08] Jango_: back when the story was good
[4:06:16] jerkchickenpapi: Metzen was the best thing that happened to WoW lote
[4:06:18] jerkchickenpapi: Lore
[4:06:35] Jango_: now we just get power ranger villians every expac
[4:06:46] Jango_: i did read the books
[4:06:46] luckfore: my guess is hes helping with Classic+ adding Tel abim and other zones he invented but never made it to classic
[4:06:48] Rudric_Ice: @jerkchickenpapi i mean metzen created the warcraft lore tbh
[4:06:55] 91Niki: @Milanesa_De_Pollo The internet love to create beef between two people on the internet where there is none
[4:06:57] Tooyoo: They should rework the azeroth map and make it massive to account for dragonflying in azeroth
[4:06:58] Molvonos: @Jango_ lol, the baddies in the early years of WoW weren't fucking Shakespere.
[4:07:03] Molvonos: Jesus, the nostalgia.
[4:07:20] Jango_: @Molvonos no doubt
[4:07:21] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:07:31] joe_g_433: @luckfore yes that’s what I was saying. Just add content to classic
[4:07:34] denflup: same
[4:07:35] sirrockstar: How can I play through every expansion like they came out ? Or is that even possible??
[4:07:43] Rudric_Ice: tow loved the jailer
[4:07:44] Jango_: @Molvonos  however you cannot tell me the villians we get now are actually engaging
[4:07:53] garmin1987: did i just hear pirate expansion?
[4:07:55] Jango_: they are trash saturday morning cartoon villians
[4:07:56] kimmo_gaming: what do you mean, we need Captain Orc Sparrow LOL
[4:08:01] joe_g_433: @sirrockstar yea it’s absolutely possible
[4:08:12] Molvonos: @Jango_ Some are, some arent.  DF's villians are superb, BFA's villians were awesome.  Some parts of Shadowlands were fantastic, Jailer not withstanding.
[4:08:15] Snabido: First boss in freehold in shambles
[4:08:21] motorboatingpro: i find it funny we can remotely contend with entities that can destroy planets on a whim
[4:08:36] scumlucki: no pirates nexxt expansion
[4:08:36] Jango_: Jailer and Eridikron are my biggest gripes
[4:08:37] dright424: Imo, the problem with the story right now is they are not giving enough story quests to flesh out the character reasoning

[4:08:47] scumlucki: pirates are boring
[4:08:47] snake_like: people would flip, but having some contained version of expansions and their gear to allow stuff like challenge modes, vanilla naxx, mage tower, etc in retail...that's evergreen content
[4:08:49] Molvonos: Iridkron's awesome.
[4:08:54] Molvonos: He's exceptionally well written.
[4:09:00] Jango_: you guys are high
[4:09:05] Molvonos: Uh, no.
[4:09:11] Milanesa_De_Pollo: If Vyranoth doesn't betray us in the end of Iridikron, I will be disappointed
[4:09:19] dright424: I just wish we had more Iridikron
[4:09:19] Milanesa_De_Pollo: for*
[4:09:28] scumlucki: @Milanesa_De_Pollo steel your self cause you know it
[4:09:42] Kiddeath77: What is good about this expansion is that your not flooded with all the hero characters from other expansions
[4:09:48] joe_g_433: @towelliee there and quests there and stuff. Then Ferak will send a rare elite when the meter fills
[4:09:57] valianya: If there's an  old world revamp I would imagine it could go two ways, being either Classic+ Vanilla restored via time Keeper bronzes, and/or creating updated graphical zones with updated questlines and content showing how the world advanced to Dragonflight era with time Keepers to send back to Cata era (and maybe Vanilla too)
[4:10:06] Sicknessqt: KEKW
[4:10:23] scumlucki: nstanced player housing when
[4:10:23] Dinosew: Dinosew subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 70 months! 
[4:10:27] Snabido: So what you saying, you wanted to stay with Illidan in legion
[4:10:39] Milanesa_De_Pollo: 11.0 Kappa
[4:10:40] Molvonos: I've been writing as a hobby and as my college minor for fuck knows how long.  Iridikron's the best written baddy in a long while.  Just because he's not *heavybreathing* Arthas.
[4:10:47] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos tell me you're a sylvanas my queen without telling u r a sylvanas my queen
[4:10:49] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I'm more hyped for the f2p announcement
[4:10:52] REDSUNDERGROUND: dont even want player housing just want guild halls
[4:10:59] ArcaneMaki: Hopefully Metzen is really involved in 11.0 lore

[4:11:31] jure__: @Molvonos more like until cataclysim
[4:11:34] Rudric_Ice: @Thdlock KEKW
[4:11:36] Milanesa_De_Pollo: @Lucki_001 They said that about a lot of things in WoW
[4:11:52] scumlucki: honestly they should expand the free trial
[4:11:59] snake_like: FeelsStrongMan wildstar housing jump puzzles
[4:12:03] scumlucki: lvling to 20 is bare bones
[4:12:04] ArcaneMaki: I wish Metzen would give Anduin the same Varian treatment. Make him come back as a f*cking baddy!
[4:12:05] Karn1987: that big flame empowerd one is what u need to loot there
[4:12:07] Lothawia: You missed 2 already
[4:12:12] johniiv: A character I would like to see shine in the game is Anduin. I feel like the game makes him look like a fragile kid but in the books he's so bad ass

[4:12:16] Molvonos: @jure__ Ehh, I'd say they fleshed her out and started doing some good things in Cata.  She wasn't written as some edgelord until way later.
[4:12:29] scumlucki: anduin will return with his and sylvanas child
[4:12:35] scumlucki: making half elfs
[4:12:45] Rudric_Ice: idk how housing makes people excited
[4:13:00] luckfore: Lucki_001 LUL
[4:13:01] scumlucki: @Rudric_Ice we are homeless
[4:13:25] Molvonos: The fact that he played us in DoTI was amazing
[4:13:50] ArcaneMaki: Draenor different timeline crap was so bad though
[4:14:23] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/7jGToLe.png ?
[4:14:26] scumlucki: how many ania you think sylvanas collected so far lol
[4:14:28] Kelticlore: Void FOrged Anduin
[4:14:39] chinfu303: anduin needs his mental health break
[4:14:42] hclark70: actually during the time travel event  - I spotted the aging Varian- that was best moment
[4:14:45] guz120: Ive been meaning to ask you this, do you have nicotine on your vape juice?
[4:14:49] kimmo_gaming: Anduin and Sylvanas are making a kid right now, a child of balance, between light and dark LOL
[4:14:57] kneelbe4zod: Got the drop. Thanks T!
[4:15:00] dimofodi: Nope only need to pick one for quest, you get automatically for being in zone/
[4:15:04] scumlucki: @kimmo_gaming light/void expansion

[4:15:40] luckfore: whole dragonflight story is pussy crap tbh
[4:15:45] BlueBlurPrime: hey was a priest, they could of made him a powerhouse paladin ....
[4:15:47] snake_like: no one gave a damn about varian until after his logosh arc. anduin's probably on his logosh shit at the moment
[4:15:50] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @N3llee (warning)
[4:15:52] avarose8910: Naww them valkyrs from the maw yeeted him away LUL
[4:15:52] Rudric_Ice: tbh the last good written villian was GARROSH SMOrc he had a purpose
[4:15:53] motorboatingpro: you think he was written out because he was created by a scandal person? or the story was just flat?
[4:15:53] ArcaneMaki: Varian lore was so good, coming back from being a gladiator with amnesia to being king
[4:15:58] dracullus: in general war could be interesting instead of warchief go crazy plot again
[4:16:03] gassygatinho: Staying on paladin next tier also or
[4:16:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Next time we see him, he will return from the Shadowlands with Varyan and Garrosh
[4:16:06] scumlucki: dude was a priest? why is he wearing plate
[4:16:17] PigPenLen: the story of dragonflight is intentionally soft
[4:16:20] Plague_GG: we have a better chance at seeing Illidan again at this point
[4:16:24] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice Fuck no. His character development was break-neck speed 180 whiplash.
[4:16:25] Nerzalus: Anduin will return and help us fight the void and iridikron
[4:16:32] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I mean, they didn't rename Alextrasza because of him
[4:16:33] kimmo_gaming: I think Illidan is making a come back in next expansion, I mean 3 expansions break, hes ready
[4:16:43] Mr_Pennywise_: 🍑 💨 💩
[4:16:46] ArcaneMaki: towNut3 towNut3 towNut3
[4:17:03] guz120: He is not prepared
[4:17:23] dracullus: only thing Afrasiabi really ruined for me is rewatching some Blizzcon reveals
[4:17:49] snake_like: who'd have thought after decades of war an expansion where we are actually at peace would feel strange
[4:18:10] Rudric_Ice: @Molvonos most of the good story telling happens in the books but common he was the best villain but yes he was pretty straightforward
[4:18:35] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Garrosh was ruined FeelsBadMan
[4:19:02] Kiddeath77: Anduin is still king he’s on FMLA so they can’t take his throne from and genn greymane won’t let that happen anyway
[4:19:44] Rudric_Ice: i wanted bwonsamdi to be a really good character but he fell off in shadowlands
[4:20:08] Molvonos: @Rudric_Ice I mean, he's a loa of death.
[4:20:08] Molvonos: lol
[4:20:30] Rudric_Ice: hah true
[4:20:37] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I mean, Shadowlands had half of it's story, at least, removed and the rest changed and rewritten.
[4:21:12] snake_like: The alliance needs a good schism for once. Could bring in scarlet crusade, defias, all sorts of anti alliance forces. Doesn't force us back into war with the orde, but makes us face ourselves

[4:22:17] valianya: Iridikron is what Jailer wanted to be.  Fighting the powers that be that used and wronged and imprisoned, playing 5D chess plans within plans to achieve his goals, ruthlessly  gaining power to save his people from a greater threat
[4:22:34] Nerzalus: like the draenei crashing the exodar

[4:52:04] Eggz1004: more like the evoker questline where the quest item has a drop rate? or something anyone that can use it can get immediately?
[4:52:06] Thdlock: last raid
[4:52:17] Milanesa_De_Pollo: last raid of the year
[4:52:18] Kelticlore: i call mini raid

[4:52:43] notdustinx: Always hopium
[4:52:45] Milanesa_De_Pollo: there's no way this is the last raid, that would mean this expansion would have less bosses than all every other expansion
[4:52:53] TweektheProphet: @Towelliee what you running a legion area for
[4:52:55] Cidal_: last -new- raid of the expac, yeah prolly
[4:52:57] snake_like: prediction: warlock, unholy dk, and augment evoker dominate meters in season 3 and dinar season 4
[4:53:02] strike879: they could do a 3 boss raid as a tie in
[4:53:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could do a one-boss raid next year, maybe
[4:53:16] eldritchcoffee: so, do you think 10.2 will be out before hallows end?
[4:53:17] TheItalianStallion321: @Milanesa_De_Pollo so? lol they dont say "hey, we need 35 raid bosses an expansion or else"
[4:53:20] ArcaneMaki: I wouldnt mind a TBC Ruby Sanctum 2.0 with just a few raid bosses in a small raid.
[4:53:22] TheUnknowing: just go to barber
[4:53:22] Kelticlore: go to barber
[4:53:24] dimofodi: ahh unlocking appearances

[4:53:25] Effin_Steffin: barbershop
[4:53:25] BoezIRL: barber
[4:53:36] denflup: its the last raid, blizzcon in november, not possible ffor blizz to announce 10.3 before expac i would guess

[4:54:35] Kelticlore: 31 bosses
[4:54:44] Brodih_: could you say that SL is biased because of the pandemic?
[4:55:24] Kelticlore: do you count Mini raids in that
[4:55:25] MulvadDK: they should do more small raids, like 3 bosses
[4:55:32] illStefan: would be strange to announce 10.3 and new expansion too

[4:56:33] Cheezwhizz: looks like the divil
[4:56:35] Hebrewish012: eyes too
[4:56:41] Olimar2121: They should do more 1-2 boss raid like they did. I like the idea that the last boss of an expansion is a only boss raid
[4:56:42] Hebrewish012: green
[4:56:43] MrRicter: if Fryakk is the ultimate boss of this expansion that would be a shame and a failure imo

[4:57:45] TheItalianStallion321: IMO if the last raid was only 1 or 2 bosses, thats a let down to the end of an expansion
[4:57:49] Rudric_Ice: make a green mog
[4:57:50] Olimar2121: they used to do it until BFA, not that old for 2 boss in a raid :P
[4:57:59] Brodih_: nipple armor BIS

[5:00:36] Sollice: He loves it and it's his job. He has been playing different games though when content is stale
[5:00:39] TheItalianStallion321: imagine quitting your job b/c you cant work from home lol
[5:00:57] Syllvn: He has always loved it, but he also plays other games. You can tell pretty easily when a streamer doesn't enjoy the games they play
[5:00:58] Sollice: @TheItalianStallion321 I would quit my job if I had to relocate back to an office
[5:01:01] Darth_Chef: what is jum pservvers?
[5:01:03] nrgman: i think both as well i just see s so many people leaving it
[5:01:04] closetn00b: @Syllvn i think an EU streamer i follow said tomorrow for you :)

[5:01:33] Syllvn: @TheItalianStallion321 I can just find anotehr job that would allow me too, why would I listen to some fool who wants me back?
[5:01:46] Darth_Chef: @Thdlock  oh
[5:01:47] JoeyGfreshness: I remember the days of working in an office.  The amount of drama and stuff going on there was worst than high school
[5:02:01] neftario105: hello
[5:02:02] Sollice: I would find another easy. My job type is an analyst. Why do I need to be in an office for that? I don't have interaction with patients or clinics and when I do I actually have to travel for that

[5:02:57] Dcarter: He’s never play for the jets
[5:02:58] Nerzalus: did you talk to the blacksmith to see the toy you can get after unlocking the manari appearance

[5:03:50] Wulfgrym: they said the same thing this morning on NFL radio, sorta joking not joking IMO
[5:03:51] Sollice: Matt Ryan would be a much better option than Brady
[5:03:52] TheItalianStallion321: Brady wont play for the Jets. just because
[5:03:52] Airwaves_Gamer: He's finalizing to become part owner of the Raiders, he can not play for another team after

[5:04:15] Dcarter: Not in this world or any other that exists
[5:04:15] TheItalianStallion321: how did he do last year with the Colts?
[5:04:19] Sollice: @Towelliee Check your NVIDIA drivers. There is a new update which benefits Starfield
[5:04:21] TheItalianStallion321: right lol
[5:04:24] DemPorkChops: Don't think Brady wants to come out of retirement to play behind the offensive line and die.
[5:04:26] TheItalianStallion321: Matt Ryan is a TERRIBLE option
[5:04:41] TheItalianStallion321: @DemPorkChops agreed
[5:04:44] jerkchickenpapi: Stream done? Noooooo
[5:04:44] TheItalianStallion321: cant blame him
[5:04:46] mavericks312: i think the logical options is Ryan,foles, or a trade for winston
[5:04:48] Sollice: Yes it had Starfield optimizations
[5:04:53] Wulfgrym: matt ryan, stick with the kid if  LUL
[5:05:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Starfield needs better drivers
[5:05:04] Sollice: Dunno
[5:05:20] mavericks312: @Wulfgrym apparently he is an annoucer already
[5:05:20] snake_like: don't beta test for nvidia. give it a week
[5:05:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: WIth the 4090 it's not so bad, but it probably helps other cards more
[5:06:10] Sollice: yea it would
[5:06:28] TheItalianStallion321: ill quit being a fuckin Jet fan if they call Matt Ryan

[5:07:24] TheItalianStallion321: @mavericks312 then you dont know football
[5:07:35] TheItalianStallion321: you are better off with Wilson b/c he knows this offense already
[5:07:37] Wulfgrym: @mavericks312 i heard McCoy as an option, Personally id give Tom however much they can and get him for 1 year
