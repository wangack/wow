If you have at any point bought the game and it's expansions, even if they were gifted to you, you CAN NOT play FF free, it will require you to get a sub.
[0:43:39] Teagens: Yet another reason why I haven't tried FF seriously yet.

[0:48:19] JattixTV: @Teagens Ya I went in another fresh on my monk to see if I cannot snag some more gear on him
[0:48:52] EndsKeeper: Not it’s 60 cloth
[0:48:56] alucardevz: i did it on mine ... was not bad .. went for 2nd wand too

[0:49:16] Teagens: @Teagens @JattixTV I dont know if Sarc and Pally are going to be free today. If they are we can possibly go back to Heroic Abberus later tonight
[0:49:26] King_SBM: Yes. First wand is only 60 cloth
[0:49:27] kihlshot: I'm starting a hardcore run because of your swifty. I love your content keep it up man!
[0:49:38] King_SBM: Or you can buy a wand at 15 from org vendor
[0:49:40] alucardevz: and alch is not that good on mage while llving.. only at 60 maybe
[0:50:38] Cerealy: alch isnt bad

[0:54:34] Mongrel_Dog: if u want to farm the 2nd wand
[0:54:36] EndsKeeper: It’s actually less than 60 linen
[0:54:38] EndsKeeper: Nope
[0:54:38] Mongrel_Dog: u need like 120 linen cloth
[0:54:40] chadgigadome: nope just 60 for the first 1
[0:54:51] EndsKeeper: I’ve done it on like four hc chara
[0:54:54] Mongrel_Dog: actually i would say like 180 linen cloth in total to get ench up to 70
[0:54:57] quentinkil: hi how are you king @Swifty
[0:55:16] Mongrel_Dog: yeah you need only 60 linen cloth for the first wand to be crafter

[5:27:36] SilkeySmooth: blizzard can do what they did in classic wow to the alliance when swifty couldny do premades
[5:28:07] Djinx_o: and all the PvP streamers playing HC :p
[5:28:22] SilkeySmooth: normal bgs are popping off 3, queue times on horde
[5:28:54] Gorillagrip: pvp died because shadowlands and dragonflight are terrible expansions
[5:29:09] Cowardpatty: Dragonflight is a great expansion
[5:29:24] milhoobrah: Wait mage?? Rip warrior dream
[5:29:40] Xaviwan078: im happy about 10.1 in dragonflight  its a good patch
[5:30:33] OxideMoto: @Gorillagrip I think differently. Honestly, with the fact I've played on and off since Vanilla, I still enjoy every aspect of the game. Maybe its because I dont play it all day every day? But I feel balancing is easier to have in this game compared to something like, say CoD.. You have a meta, that stays the meta, and its just repetitive matches every time.
[5:30:42] SilkeySmooth: i liek solo shuffle im 2-3 boxing all my classes
[5:30:49] OxideMoto: I just see that PvP in this game always has some sort of variety
[5:31:16] OxideMoto: Like I don't understand why people say the game sucks
[5:31:28] Electafuzz: sounds like prestige
[5:31:28] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store

[5:31:58] Djinx_o: As a healer... meh
[5:31:59] Woldegg: its fun as a dps
[5:32:02] SilkeySmooth: i liek to cap my vault cashes
[5:32:03] Aldever13: i loved it, until i started losing every single one
[5:32:07] davidbrandonllc: i like solo shuffle a lot i just do not like the rating system for it
[5:32:12] Woldegg: but not as a healer from what I heard
[5:32:19] LawlessVon: solo is ight, q times can be excessive.
[5:32:22] excessminkk: Hey swifty what happened to your youtube channel? do you just focus on streaming these days? Ive been a fan since WOTLK man
[5:32:27] Woldegg: friend plays holy pala this patch and really hates it

[5:32:38] Xaviwan078: star citizzen
[5:32:42] rettie12: Destiny
[5:32:47] SilkeySmooth: we need a new mmo out..lol
[5:32:58] toer1: how are scifi shooters unique?
[5:33:12] OxideMoto: @Teagens Im just using it as an example, because balancing on a game like that requires much more precision, to keep it fresh and fun... Whereas, on WoW, I personally see a variety in PvP. Its not just the same classes and specs every single match
[5:33:20] Woldegg: CS go is way more  fun than overwatch tbh

[5:57:52] back_again_paradar: tbf you still need to have a high level char to get all of that. And in terms of boosting and gold you will never be able to win, unless you remove the majority trading between players.
