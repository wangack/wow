[1:31:42] Heos90: b/c paladin is fun but man wotlk paladin was so fun and strong
[1:31:45] anseyoh: fun thing about renovations: First 80% of the work takes about 20% of the time. Then you have to ride the subcontractors because they universally drag their asses along.
[1:31:55] preorderTV: That bot letting new ppl coming in that ur not homeless or moving is pog xD I was like wtf this dude divorced and thrown into an empty ampartment now ??
[1:32:23] iLLW1LL: I was such a baddie during TBC, looking forward to attacking it again as less of a shitter
[1:32:52] Heos90: what made u decide to renovate?
[1:32:53] Kromede: all black POGGERS
[1:33:12] anseyoh: the management will definitely be on point. that setup is good for sure. but he also is probably using subs... that drag their asses and you gotta be the one to crack the whip on 'em. hopefully you made sure to withhold some of the $$ to be paid upon completion.
[1:33:18] LSBreed: sounds like you are working with some good people.

[1:35:32] Sollice: Costco will have a large one. Get 2 from there
[1:35:37] anseyoh: when we found our current house the builder had already put in hardwood on the main floor and i was like 'damn.' they always talk about how much 'character' the scuffs and scratches add... but ain't nobody wanna move into a house with someone else's character all over the floor you know?
[1:36:02] YardRage: he bringin' everyone D:
[1:36:04] Sollice: @ndruo That depends on the kind of wood for "character"

[2:01:41] MrGattz: honestly iv been reporting all those hot tub streams for nudity. i dont hate the stream, i hate that its on this platform and twitch needs to figure out what the hell its identity is because they have no clue what they want to be atm and its sad.

[2:04:36] lanara233: Blizzard has corrupt design philosophy whereas Dreamhaven will have a healthier culture
[2:04:36] MrGattz: @Kromede again its not that i hate the content, but this isnt an onlyfans advertising platform. and twitch went from "males hate to wear a shirt while they stream or they get banned" to being in a tiny bikini in a hot tub bending over for subs is totally fine.

[2:11:44] maalow: it's when people get banned for showing things unintentionaly that i get pissed off, twitch is playing a double game
[2:12:02] Sharkeys: the dude who has been sleeping on steam has a loophole where his mods take over. since someone is there actually doing content

[2:12:27] iLLW1LL: those website exist already tho.  It's just emergent behaviour on twitch because some 'smart' folks figured out how to monetize it.

This boost will not be usable on Classic Era realms or on the new blood elf or draenei races; in addition, players will be limited to boosting only one character per World of Warcraft account

[3:51:03] chadleyhank: So this is confirmed boost at prepatch? I thought the point of 58 boost was to be 58 in hellfire not have time to level up to 60 and acquire gear
[3:51:38] belfmon: whats the addon for that exp bar and timer up in the screen
[3:51:40] YardRage: compared to BRD yeah IIRC

[3:51:56] Nehcrom: towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple towBleedpurple
[3:52:12] DocsMistake: @bradleyhank the point of the boost is to have a character that is near the level of your friends to play the expansion when it comes out so you arent stuck leveling in classic while they move on

[3:53:17] chadleyhank: @docsmistake yeah I just hadn’t seen any messaging that it would be on prepatch but I guess that makes sense but at the same time if you can’t go to Outland why are you gonna boost you aren’t even playing tbc yet if you hate classic so much it’s still classic for all intensive purposes during prepatch

[3:53:31] YardRage: worg pup towOny
[3:53:41] chadleyhank: @kinghorn hypeeee
[3:53:47] JakZones: @Towelliee According to WoWhead BRD is the largest dungeon in the game
[3:53:50] Alepouditsa: cya
[3:54:06] Shurn_82: brd was supposed to be a raid, then they changed their mind from what I read
[3:54:20] chadleyhank: Anyone in hammersquad need a krol blade? kek
[3:54:22] nintendyoh: 2992 + 4 = 2996
[3:54:35] jerexify: @Towelliee Are you going to buy your epic mount on your Druid?
[3:54:41] Coffins85: It was a 10 Man Raid in its first iteration.
[3:54:52] dalaraz: brf,first megadungeon ever :p
[3:55:43] bogilicious: Never played shaman, what is the best spec for a group? Restoration?
[3:56:09] DocsMistake: give me a bit and I probably can, im running simulation for a lab right now so my pc is really laggy right now lol

[3:56:44] bogilicious: Thanks Shurn!
[3:57:09] bogilicious: I have only done hunters and warriors so I want a change.
[3:57:13] SonofHorus82: I think I'm giving up on my dream of getting to 60 before pre-patch with my Shaman. I'm just getting burned out on leveling and no one wants to run dungeons right now.
[3:57:40] t_800_i: tbc Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:57:48] bogilicious: @Shurn_82 What would you suggest for a new player? I assume Belf Fire mage is common since Kaelthas is a thing lol
[3:58:02] theycallmedukey: dont support nike lol
[3:58:26] giggity360: @SonofHorus82 pick up Zygor for a month and optimize it. It'll get you there faster
[3:59:07] mavericks312: towel have you seen the new dame sneaks
[3:59:13] nintendyoh: Be less white "Nike"
[3:59:28] bogilicious: @MackenTV I thought that was Coke who said that haha
[3:59:29] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:59:50] nintendyoh: @bogilicious You're right, I got them mixed up. Maybe it was the human blood sneakers with Nike
[3:59:50] LilChiliMPH: Why not support Nike? Lol cause the nas x shoes? They sued the company that made them and didn't have anything to do with them.
[3:59:54] SonofHorus82: @giggity360 I might do that. I've already done the grind twice on Alliance so I'm almost to the point of being over it right now.
[4:00:45] JMoney_1331: Don't you have a playstation pair? If i remember correctly
[4:00:46] jerexify: @Towelliee We don't have a date for TBC pre-patch yet, correct?
[4:00:59] mavericks312: @nova_rynn didn't they have a Nike swish on them though

[4:01:43] jerexify: @mavericks312 They did, because Nike shoes were used as the base for the design. But Nike was not involved, and did not give consent, for the use of their shoes, to the design company.
[4:01:58] Shurn_82: drop of blood in them
[4:01:59] LilChiliMPH: @mavericks312 yeah but the company that made them bought them and custom made them. Nike didn't make them from the factory like that
[4:02:09] Shurn_82: it was odd
[4:02:31] JMoney_1331: The DBZ Adidas run was sick too
[4:02:31] zaraine1: wait sneakers with a drop of blood in them? for real?

[4:02:45] mavericks312: honestly I would have bought a pair
[4:02:54] LilChiliMPH: The company that made the nas x shoes made Nike shoes with legit holy water in them from Jerusalem and no one batted an eye at it lol
[4:03:02] Bossk_XD: If you buy nike shoes, there is a good chance there is already blood and sweat in your shoe, since they're made in sweatshops.
[4:03:03] mavericks312: @zaraine1 idk how true the blood was
[4:03:06] Kromede: https://www.darklegacycomics.com/767 KEKW
[4:03:08] astraone: So looks like they've added completely new tutorial quests for the TBC boost characters now. Guess it's going nowhere.
[4:03:15] alibynx: they are made with real blood ;)
[4:03:16] Chuzzles93: they did a KISS comic that had the blood of the band in the ink once
[4:03:36] Voric_: ebay?
[4:03:41] Shurn_82: that and the soul of the shoe had a drop of human blood in them (so its says) lol
[4:04:13] Shurn_82: @Chuzzles93 yea, but not in an era of fucking snowflakes
[4:04:14] Shurn_82: lol
[4:04:16] Pannekaker: It's just a small tutorial for boosted characters only
[4:04:26] Kinghorn: blizzard seeing dollar signs
[4:04:43] shale93: no changes or rito
[4:04:43] astraone: We know it's inevitable, it's still shitty.
[4:04:44] Shurn_82: Blizzard is a company...they do not survive on hugs and kisses
[4:04:49] TheUnknowing: I love #somechanges
[4:04:58] warrenny: @astraone Is it tho
[4:05:05] TheUnknowing: but i do, pucker up Kappa @Shurn_82
[4:05:11] Shurn_82: @TheUnknowing ooooo
[4:05:14] mavericks312: Blizzard seen how much they missed out on in classic there not making the same mistake with tbc
[4:05:20] Pannekaker: @astraone, Is it really though?
[4:05:21] BearGrindsGames: Either you pay Blizz or some rando mage to spam dungeons for hours
[4:05:48] ピンドロール: only thing boosting might ruin is how easy it'll be to level profession alts for bots potentially
[4:05:54] bogilicious: @Shurn_82 What two professions go well with Mage, Herbalism and Enchantment?
[4:05:55] Glynn11: people have been paying to level since I played original TBC. it just meant sending $100 over paypal to a chinese company to level you
[4:06:03] LilChiliMPH: Why will boosting ruin the game? Blizzard makes money, and the people who boost the majority will quit cause they don't like the game so no harm to the players who stay

[4:06:08] mavericks312: Blizzard is about to back the brinks trucks up with tbc and wrath
[4:06:21] astraone: Paying real money and ingame currency to a player that's learnt to provide a service is totally different
[4:06:31] Shurn_82: @bogilicious Tailor (make gear for yourself, and bags for inventory space) and a gathering prof (mining/herb/skinning - to sell for cash)
[4:06:41] Pewpewasaurus: not when most of those people doing the service sell the gold for rl money
[4:06:41] jbmoongirl: Can’t wait to see your stream room once it’s finished
[4:06:42] bogilicious: coolio
[4:06:46] bogilicious: Thanks Shurn
[4:06:51] Shurn_82: @bogilicious you could also take Tailor and Enchant but enchant tends to cost a bit
[4:07:00] bigbill_tv: @Towelliee Did you move ? Your room looks totally different
[4:07:09] Gargeth: Gargeth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 65 months!

[4:07:17] Gargeth: Salud!
[4:07:18] ArcaneSyntax: mage boosting is so much worse than botting.
[4:07:19] Shurn_82: @bogilicious once you level cap, you can change from the GATHERING prof, to enchant and spam low level dungeons for the gear to disenchant if thats what you want
[4:07:20] bogilicious: @Shurn_82 Are enchanters common since it tends to cost more?
[4:07:26] bogilicious: ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
[4:07:26] Pannekaker: @Xxsdee, Why do you think that?
[4:07:28] bimyouX: @Xxsdee if u feel like that, its better off without you

[4:08:29] peinen: why would a bot account spend money to boost when they can just bot to the max level?
[4:08:31] nintendyoh: People who complain about botters using the boost is just using that as an excuse to get rid of the SINGLE use boost.
[4:08:37] Shurn_82: lots of opinions in chat, its nice to see the discussion
[4:08:39] dalaraz: i so much want some fresh servers :/

[4:09:44] VictorAvalanche: Big True
[4:09:45] SonofHorus82: LOL the magic of the game. Holy shit I was drinking and almost choked on my water.
[4:09:46] DallTV_: not only in wow thats in irl aswell
[4:09:57] kokochris: unnecessary gatekeeping
[4:10:01] ArcaneSyntax: does buying a boost make my spellbook fuck up? thats the only way it would fuck with magic
[4:10:03] warrenny: Thats human to complain
[4:10:17] TheUnknowing: You can say whatever you want, doesn't mean it makes sense @Xxsdee

[4:11:36] bogilicious: Boosting meaning... having ahigh level player run you through dungeons and stuff?
[4:11:38] nintendyoh: Bring dual spec!
[4:11:44] bimyouX: me paying for the boost bec i dont have time to play -> ruining the game literally everyone on classic rn sitting at the start of ZG getting boosted -> living the magic
[4:11:53] ArcaneSyntax: fuck dual spec i want barber shops
[4:12:06] nintendyoh: barber shops lol
[4:12:09] RhadigarTV: I need to log onto my character on the Hammer Squad
[4:12:23] Shurn_82: @bogilicious theres 2 forms of boosting, one is paying BLIZZARD officially to get 1 x level 58 in tbc  /   or pay with ingame gold to have a higher level kill mobs fast
