[0:59:37] Nikademous: O ok
[0:59:40] MaximumnNeo: the top 4 of the cross region was 2 NA teams and 2 European teams
[0:59:42] Crwxxx: @Cocoapuffs1 probably cause only 1 NA team top 5
[0:59:43] Nikademous: 2nd then
[0:59:43] jobeanz: @jne14 no he’s from Australia I think?
[0:59:56] Nikademous: First losers rip
[0:59:56] Cocoapuffs1: @Crwxxx there was 2 each for top 4
[1:00:09] JNE14: @jobeanz oh yea!
[1:00:20] Kroski: And lets face it, maybe a different outcome would be true if the ping was fair, etc
[1:00:21] Cocoapuffs1: @Crwxxx also the team that won lost the previous series vs the same team
[1:00:22] zachgamegodx: void had some interesting picks
[1:00:24] MaximumnNeo: i think if you take away echo, NA and Europe are super close
[1:00:24] zachgamegodx: the double dh
[1:00:27] Nikademous: Cohesion
[1:00:29] Nikademous: Maybe
[1:00:56] dickman911: i dont think US teams wargame for 6 hours a day like echo does, but i could be wrong
[1:01:01] FateIRL: there wont be another cross region tourney because raiku whined
[1:01:02] BCboy_: they would rather queue bear druid for fun and troll the tourney
[1:01:13] vortex071232: damn i do half your dps on dummies lmao
[1:01:15] absterge: kalvishs team prob coulda done better into chibaku tensai but they just... played druid double DH instead of sham
[1:01:28] JNE14: breakfast time g2g! @venruki keep up the good and great work.
[1:01:41] ATHLTE: yea idk what was goin on with void
[1:01:44] Msv2: The best and brightest in NA are probably at work creating GDP xD

[1:02:09] rizdane: im not a fan of either of them.
[1:02:15] buffevoker: Yo venruki

[1:06:00] shameshady: @Nikademous my point was that it is not like an entire region is dominating another .. it is a few very good players who have been winning a lot .. nothing wrong about it .. was just an addition to the "why is EU dominating" comment that was made
[1:06:00] absterge: @Garthd werewofl

[1:40:17] Banwellx: KEKW
[1:40:17] matt_caste: Probably the rich and rewarding rotation and toolkit, the high skill ceiling
[1:40:19] primejusticegaming: every game mode they are just OP
[1:40:25] willie_stroker_99: If you can be good in comedy, you will be killing it at drama
[1:40:28] Msv2: Insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeee

[2:12:24] shameshady: you hate playing feral, or you hate the concept of feral in general ?
[2:12:27] zerx_gg: i think it'd be mainly dps vs dps
[2:12:28] JonnyJoystick: Just do double dps
[2:12:28] ItsBees: want me to heal still or do boomy
[2:12:30] JonnyJoystick: instant ques
[2:12:31] aftershockzzzz: if you could be 2 dps vs 2 dps
[2:12:33] Vramii: Dev evoker :)
[2:12:37] TimmyShoes: what if i gave 100 gifted subs but then you have to get rank 1 as a prot healer in solo shuffle
[2:12:38] nicoros61: 5v5 shuffle?
[2:12:40] gr_faux: dps only rated 2s soloqueue
[2:12:46] nikthevoker: LETS GO DEVOKER! LUL

[2:14:31] Jax511: wow pvp is fun huh
[2:14:39] willie_stroker_99: Bees man, use tranq
[2:14:40] poetic_mixup: Feral/WW will own harder
[2:14:55] StromicusRex: bees aint no feral player
[2:15:05] gr_faux: barkskin bear feral regen
[2:15:07] Cocoapuffs1: cata gonna be so dead
[2:15:09] ItsBees: I'm somehow worse at feral
[2:15:10] gr_faux: frenzied
[2:15:12] zerx_gg: frost mage mastery season 9 pog
[2:15:14] StromicusRex: im excited for cata
[2:15:15] peeachy8: cata sounds fun but I don't want to level lol
[2:15:27] ItsBees: Firelands was the best part of cata
[2:15:29] skez_live: zero interest in cata unfortunately for me
[2:15:33] StromicusRex: ye
[2:15:35] dolfeezzyy: if u have an 80 from wrath it isnt too bad
[2:15:36] zerx_gg: yessirrr
[2:15:41] zerx_gg: i might play cata on NA
[2:15:49] BanthaBantha: Have you seen asmons video regarding mythic raiding
[2:15:58] StromicusRex: my sod guild all boosted 80s on wrath so we can raid cata
[2:16:03] Bodify: Isnt the second one pretty good too?
[2:16:10] rethumtv: will BM hunter be pre-fixed in Cata? it's final patches again right?
[2:16:21] StromicusRex: come raid with us @zerx_gg
[2:16:24] diblet25: when is cata coming out?
[2:16:38] kingcamps_alot: if you look at both road maps cata beta lines up with war within beta and the mystery 10.2.6 patch
[2:16:44] StromicusRex: "fun guy bees" lol
[2:16:47] BanthaBantha: community council forum post, talks about how its part of the problem with modern wow. Has some interesting points.
[2:16:48] ItsBees: :3
[2:16:49] darkwingdad__: cata is just rmp rogues one shotting in cheap shot
[2:17:11] zerx_gg: pop off king
[2:17:17] zerx_gg: i might @StromicusRex
[2:17:23] zerx_gg: just unsure about paying 2 subs lol
[2:17:29] StromicusRex: dont blame you
[2:17:38] StromicusRex: times would be awful for you too tbh
[2:17:39] kingcamps_alot: i think its why theyre holding changes off
[2:17:41] zerx_gg: guess ill have to become a content creator
[2:17:49] zerx_gg: what times do you raid at
[2:17:51] Applezbtw: hopefully its more wands on the pvp vendor
[2:17:57] zerx_gg: like 7 EST? or something
[2:18:02] CabinetMistake: @Applezbtw KEKW
[2:18:05] imrobk: they're going to use the 10.2.6 announcement to drop world of warcraf mobile announcement
[2:18:07] goesidd: remember when they missed the week of patch release with the last twitch drop, they dont know what theyre doing
[2:18:08] StromicusRex: yes actually
[2:18:16] zerx_gg: thats 1 am for me so its not too bad
[2:18:18] lampholder: didn't know about 10.2.6
[2:18:36] zerx_gg: bro flippin Zhonya'd
[2:18:43] StromicusRex: things might be a lil diff in cata tho bc thats based on sod raid
[2:18:44] CabinetMistake: that was a fast queue i feel like
[2:18:48] heymomimonttv: i think ww is equally frustrating as arms lol
[2:19:11] zerx_gg: boofarcooone
[2:19:11] galdinator: remember when ww was the king of mobility? Kappa
[2:19:18] Reminosity: evokers and frost/arcane mages make me want to quit WW every time
[2:19:33] CabinetMistake: why wouldn't you be here for it? D: where's he going?
[2:19:33] zerx_gg: ill stream in ur stead np
[2:19:33] BanthaBantha: Not sure i can post links, maybe a mod can pull it up. Came out yesterday.
[2:19:41] skez_live: how long you leaving?
[2:19:42] zerx_gg: im funny too
[2:19:43] jporter_: it will be fun to watch you relive our excitment
[2:19:45] CabinetMistake: ah
[2:19:47] Jarettol: how long are you going to be gone?
[2:19:48] rethumtv: its an hour long video, but basically the rant is about PvE structure being locked to 4 new zones, 1 new raid per cycle with  9-11 bosses.   Rather then doing lots of little raids like they used to do
[2:19:51] zerx_gg: you can link BanthaBantha
[2:19:56] conman_91: i'll never forget you
[2:19:57] zerx_gg: sub perks and dat
[2:20:02] imrobk: Is your sister linking up with y'all while you're in italy?
[2:20:03] Jarettol: italy is a great place to visit...the food is amazing
[2:20:03] json_dotcom: sweet, where in Italy are you going @venruki ?
[2:20:05] StromicusRex: yeah we aint doin no work, link that shit yourself
[2:20:24] zerx_gg: we're not nearly paid enough for this shit
[2:20:25] BanthaBantha: lmao

[2:20:29] StromicusRex: tru
[2:20:30] diblet25: it'll be fun to watch a streamer catch up from an 8 day draught
[2:20:32] StromicusRex: we're not paid at all
[2:20:33] Vramii: yo ven do you like dogs?
[2:20:34] StromicusRex: in fact

[2:24:15] sleightxyz: hello ven!
[2:24:16] ItsBees: what the hell is all this xdd stuff
[2:24:22] carneasada34: just played a very obvious healer bot. started every game walking forward into the other spawn, and wouldnt do anything until someone dropped health
[2:24:24] CabinetMistake: @ItsBees xddkiss
[2:24:31] ItsBees: D: I still don't understand

[2:27:08] Bigmoran: @venruki how is it that every time I tune into your stream in the afternoon you have the most horrendous lobby imaginable
[2:27:33] Kujo_XX: Thought I was watching foxy for a minute there: k.............k...........k...........k.........k.......k
[2:27:51] zerx_gg: Billiam Moran!
[2:27:53] CabinetMistake: surely we don't 0-6 this
[2:28:09] Bigmoran: Hello @zerx_gg

[2:30:25] Jihnn: And let it been known that nobody beats Buffarcane 4 times in a row!
[2:30:26] Bigmoran: Cata beta out @venruki only level 1's tho.
[2:30:31] conman_91: rls the og

[2:30:59] Solre1: Hey Venruki. I ran into Mes on his dh in a 2.3k solo shuffle lobby on my dh and he said I did pretty good. Should I feel honored? This is my first pvp season
[2:31:18] Bigmoran: @Solre1 No man you should feel terrible
[2:31:20] Nikademous: No
[2:31:23] Nikademous: Dh lmao
[2:31:41] CabinetMistake: dhs Tssk
[2:31:46] vodkacran: @Solre1 did you win the lobby?
[2:31:48] fungames: is warlock a better caster than frost mage for 2s?
[2:31:52] Solre1: @vodkacran 4-2
[2:32:25] fungames: if rogue didn’t overlap fear and gouge that was a w there

[2:33:52] tomjb91: Nerf shroud
[2:34:06] Nikademous: So if I dono and choose blood dk?!?!?!
[2:34:06] shameshady: is the immunity the mw gets from revival, is it a total immunity to magic or only to macigal dmg ?
[2:34:44] fungames: it makes polymorph miss

[2:35:24] jporter_: how did you make it out of the 2k range as aff? I have hunters who scatter one target and trap another then rets just run in and aoe blind all my dots off

[2:36:15] ferahgok: Circa<3
[2:36:25] diblet25: suki suki 5 dolla
[2:36:29] Saitistreamy: @jporter_ r1 players will just 6-0 a lobby at some point, removing them out of the elo hell. so if 2k is around your actual range and 5-1 is pushing it, good luck
[2:36:45] 5tarchild: vensucky
[2:36:46] matt_caste: I just watched your vid on the bots, you should talk to Pika about what we ran into 2 nights ago. We ran some random BGs at like 4am with a group of friends and 3 games in a row we faced a full team of bots. He talked about it a bit on stream yesterday
[2:36:55] jporter_: @Saitistreamy im 2500 on demo rn, i literally cant get a lobby where people arent clearing my dots
[2:36:56] BanthaBantha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z779q2SFKOs @venruki.
[2:36:59] gr_faux: good try ven
[2:37:24] Saitistreamy: @jporter_ you gotta 6-0 a game randomly, then you'll be ok

[2:38:16] kaounallah: kaounallah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! chair punch or it isn't real haha
[2:38:16] vortex071232: gotta run tier at least

[2:38:30] FrankyHealz: what are the best stats for dev evoker
[2:38:37] Robofat: mastery
[2:38:43] vortex071232: need 4 set id say
[2:38:53] R1_Prototype: I realize today that if I’m going to R1 every single class in the game, then that means I actually have to play an evoker. eww

[2:39:33] nameyourform: no
[2:39:35] nameyourform: not hard
[2:39:38] nameyourform: just repetitve
[2:39:40] willie_stroker_99: Nah, it's shit already
[2:39:42] ItsBees: it needs to go to flex though, the 20 thing is dumb
[2:39:43] demtrollzZ: I have not touched a mythic raid in my life, I have no opinion on it
[2:39:47] conman_91: don't care just give me 3s
[2:39:54] leeka: it should be hard,  but should be cosmetic rewards only
[2:39:56] Hobblefoot: That is the point!  If you don't want hard raiding there is Normal or Heroic.
[2:39:58] Mhortai: Mythic raiding is suppose to be hard
[2:40:10] Mhortai: Ugh
[2:40:11] baxter5569: mythic is just boring. you rely on 19 other ppl to not be dumb. no variability after first couple kills
[2:40:12] FateIRL: asmon hasnt pvp'd since shadowlands
[2:40:13] FateIRL: lol
[2:40:14] Mhortai: WHAT
[2:40:15] MisterThatDude: I’ve never mythic raided before. just seems too hard to even get in a group
[2:40:20] Solre1: Incoming venruki youtube video
[2:40:22] tarth_100: arena garbage cuz we too good
[2:40:23] smickdizzle: its bad cuz ppl are good
[2:40:24] Mhortai: Battlegrounds are the most active part of PVP rofl
[2:40:37] Jarettol: I wonder why ppl still watch him, lol
[2:40:44] imrobk: this sounds like typical i want more participation award complaining
[2:40:45] Saitistreamy: Asmon is right about the issue with arena. When was the last time you played with someone from IRL? Have you seen how bad they are?
[2:40:46] tool_ateralus: xD
[2:40:47] nvees: imo there is world pvp.. a bit more than the last expacs
[2:40:49] Evoca85: I think PVP is too hard. PVP needs a simplified spellbook, there can't be 30 buttons on your bar for PVP it's crazy. I love PVP and I'm not bad, but I wish it was easier to get into
[2:40:54] imrobk: this is real hard to listen to lol
[2:40:56] FateIRL: theres lots of world pvp
[2:40:59] gr_faux: cookin
[2:41:02] willie_stroker_99: He doesn't play wow...
[2:41:02] ItsBees: Spicy take for someone who barely plays
[2:41:02] nikthevoker: easy
[2:41:03] FateIRL: but he doesnt play to know
[2:41:08] Deyconn: is pretty casual these days
[2:41:10] Saitistreamy: He isnt wrong
[2:41:11] nikthevoker: he doesnt play retail
[2:41:15] Robofat: there is the game for casuals SoD
[2:41:15] Scotch1230: I never bother with raiding, but really never have. Too much time investment.
[2:41:16] Deyconn: gear a character fully in like 3 days
[2:41:17] Kujo_XX: "It's too hard for him to get content out of"
[2:41:19] imrobk: "easy" is the word you're looking for. he wants everything to be free.
[2:41:20] vortex071232: its literally not possible considering the good players in wow would stay anyway lol
[2:41:21] Luigicamp: he sounds like my 93yo dad after I asked what he thinks of kpop
[2:41:22] Axtin: ive been finding it harder and harder to agree with his takes lately
[2:41:25] gr_faux: he would be fine if every class had one button as long as you got loot from the one shot
[2:41:25] Mhortai: Asmon admitted his on bias. He admitted the best time for him was when he was playing with his Mom and friends.
[2:41:27] Sloppy1221: The game needs to be recycled
[2:41:28] thewy: His takes are very extreme
[2:41:31] zerx_gg: you need 2 t-shirts to have a valid opinion
[2:41:32] illEvan11_11: it is definitely true that pvp is to the point where newcomers legit cant play and have fun at all
[2:41:35] imrobk: if you've overcome nothing you've done 0 growing. if something is hard go agane
[2:41:39] rommoiran: wrath pvp harder than DF tbh
[2:41:42] Robofat: play SoD
[2:41:44] cavi_tv: Asmons revenue stream revolves around bashing WoW
[2:41:45] Axtin: asmon wants 40 man raiding to be a thing again "cause its cool"
[2:41:45] Saitistreamy: we have pushed skill SO FAR BEYOND the system
[2:41:49] Locturnal_TV: these problems dont only apply to wow either
[2:41:50] Robofat: @rommoiran no
[2:41:54] Saitistreamy: IE WOW is too old, to be a good game anymore
[2:41:55] Locturnal_TV: this is literally every competitive game now days
[2:41:55] Evoca85: Or REMOVE all addons from PVP. That might be an easier fix
[2:41:58] mrRobocto: That's the take - 100% what you said, "It's the players"
[2:42:15] rommoiran: i play both lol, yes @Robofat
[2:42:16] willie_stroker_99: PvP requires skill... yeah, it does
[2:42:23] ItsBees: Arena is competitive...
[2:42:31] nameyourform: 100p
[2:42:34] willie_stroker_99: This is so bs
[2:42:34] Bodify: didnt he just say theres no1 playing rbgs? are all those competitive world pvpers? KEKW
[2:42:40] cavi_tv: He just contradicted
[2:42:40] Hobblefoot: I am convinced Asmond has some kind of psychological issues when it comes to WoW and his personal hubris.  It feels like he clings so hard to when he was known as a WoW God that he resents what it has become because he is no longer good enough to play it.
[2:42:41] cavi_tv: Himself
[2:42:42] cavi_tv: Lmao
[2:42:44] thewy: LMAFO
[2:42:44] Mhortai: Oh wow, his isn't wrong there lol
[2:42:45] thewy: LMFAOOO
[2:42:47] craxity: bullshit...i alwys be farmed in arena because around 1.7k are only glads...
[2:42:52] Mhortai: about the balancing around arena
[2:42:55] Necrolancer47: LUL
[2:42:57] willie_stroker_99: He's just talking bs
[2:42:57] Bendix10: why does this guy still ask about a game he hasn't played in years a this point
[2:42:59] Kujo_XX: We're literally sitting in shit meta with shit balance...cause AWC
[2:43:03] rethumtv: awful take
[2:43:04] MisterThatDude: what a take
[2:43:05] tarth_100: zero shot, hate rbgs and love arena
[2:43:07] FateIRL: what the fuck is arena
[2:43:07] heymomimonttv: @Hobblefoot tbh i think you might be onto something
[2:43:08] airgordan08: /disagree
[2:43:09] FateIRL: lol
[2:43:10] Solre1: Dude does not even play and thinks he understands pvp
[2:43:10] Necrolancer47: same
[2:43:11] Saitistreamy: they should make a WOW arena video game
[2:43:12] tool_ateralus: lol
[2:43:12] AJbluey: Mythic raiding is just not accessible. Everyone who has a life can't raid mythic. They need to add a solo que rating based raiding system that gives mythic raid loot and has a difficulty between heroic / mythic.   Idk about you but organising my life around raiding 4 hours a night does not promote an even remotely healthy lifestyle.
[2:43:12] Mhortai: Now arena should also be around
[2:43:13] Saitistreamy: that isnt wow
[2:43:15] Chrono_s: there are players that they only do BG
[2:43:15] conman_91: tought take there
[2:43:15] heymomimonttv: arena is the entire reason i started playing wow
[2:43:16] noggysipples: arena is king
[2:43:21] rommoiran: agreed
[2:43:22] BickenBone: ice cold take
[2:43:23] 3KuLTV: its each to their own
[2:43:23] X2DR: sucks to suck lol
[2:43:24] conman_91: tough*
[2:43:27] tarth_100: arena is the most unique fun experience ever
[2:43:33] nameyourform: shuffle fixed and broke pvp at the same time change my mind
[2:43:34] swolecolemole: only time he does PvP is when he's getting a boost because he's a big name streamer to get his free glad mount
[2:43:35] Nikademous: But ur still the minority, his point is not entirely wrong
[2:43:35] smickdizzle: sounding like a socialist
[2:43:38] 5tarchild: on god
[2:43:38] TimmyShoes: arena is the only thing in WoW worth playing lol
[2:43:42] willie_stroker_99: He sucks at pvp
[2:43:42] cavi_tv: WotLK arenas were nostalgia tinted
[2:43:43] leeka: they were a blast at the time
[2:43:44] goatddy: well not if youre a shadowmourne warrior
[2:43:47] goatddy: LOL
[2:43:48] Saitistreamy: modern WOTLK is bad
[2:43:49] solipsis89: doesnt this guy get r1s to carry him to glad lol
[2:43:50] vodkacran: I only play arena BUT I think he has a point in the perspective PvE has a larger player base
[2:43:52] Mhortai: Ya wrath arena sucked. I tried lol
[2:43:52] Nikademous: The smaller percentage of players probably do t arena
[2:43:57] tool_ateralus: cant rewind time lol
[2:43:58] Solre1: WotLK is how I found you "Down goes Venruki!!"
[2:43:59] freelofear: The guy who got carried every season to glad, has a terrible opinion on arena go fig
[2:44:00] xmostpalone: we heard you like hpal warrior ele
[2:44:02] R1_Prototype: everytime I come back from ads twitch crashes.
[2:44:06] heymomimonttv: wotlk hasnt aged well, and the playerbase is so elitist gatekeeper now
[2:44:11] imrobk: Wrath arenas were a blast in original wrath when the meta shifted and people didn't math it out 20 years ago. Classic WOTLK did 0 to capture the old magic because of it.
[2:44:20] illEvan11_11: arena is definitely an amazing game mode, i do think he has a point tho in terms of, if the game is revolved around 3v3, then humans inherently just play the 3 man comp that is the most overpowered. In battlegrounds, it gets spread out and more room for players
[2:44:29] rembrandt89: feel like 5v5 would be such a shit show now
[2:44:29] Hobblefoot: EXACTLY.  Asmond misses when people were bad at the game because his ego is still attached to that time of his life. Which is insane because he is far better off now.
[2:44:42] solipsis89: what a crazy comparison
[2:44:44] cavi_tv: @Hobblefoot +++++
[2:44:48] R1_Prototype: mythic is WAY too hard. thats true.
[2:44:57] mrRobocto: apples to oranges
[2:45:00] mrRobocto: bad take
[2:45:08] willie_stroker_99: I'm sorry, but this is bs
[2:45:14] craxity: ppl like u should only play vs also glads ... wherr is the fun for me against ur twink play arena???
[2:45:16] cavi_tv: @Hobblefoot , at this point his content is just bashing WoW because he can't actually play anymore
[2:45:17] Nikademous: I hate repeating the same shit over and over and calling it "mechanics"
[2:45:18] Jrexlol: rukiCreep
[2:45:32] deathkiddox: I just wish we can do rated rbg solo
[2:45:42] Saitistreamy: wow is a carrot on a stick game, and the stick is insanely long
[2:45:43] imrobk: No that actually makes sense unfortunately. Devs are given instructions to do things that increase share holder revenue.
[2:46:03] imrobk: its why a lot of indie games are fucking crushing while AAA is watered down doodoo
[2:46:03] heymomimonttv: @deathkiddox thats bg blitz. next time you do it, look at scoreboard and see your mmr
[2:46:04] Necrolancer47: him and his viewers cant stand losing in pvp so they just right if off instead of improving
[2:46:05] rembrandt89: @deathkiddox next expansion
[2:46:17] mrRobocto: dude, again, bad take from Asmon, comparing gold sellers to RWF
[2:46:20] BanthaBantha: haha
[2:46:22] Saitistreamy: @Necrolancer47 you realize that means wow has a problem right?
[2:46:29] mrRobocto: it's actually cringe to watch
[2:46:30] Saitistreamy: responding to people who quit with get good
[2:46:32] TimmyShoes: @imrobk it doesn't make sense, making a game for the investors means making a game for the players. because the players are who pay to play the game, and their money goes back to the investors.
[2:46:32] swolecolemole: i agree with that point, like the fact we wait for PvP changes until AWC is done is degenerate.
[2:46:33] Saitistreamy: is bad stratgey
[2:46:34] Mhortai: RTWF is a MASSIVE promo for wow that blizzard doesn't have to run
[2:46:37] Axtin: sometimes i dont even know what hes saying
[2:46:38] baxter5569: asmon is so out of touch with wow and jaded. he just needs to stop playing and reacting.
[2:46:40] diblet25: he's a good actor
[2:46:44] hunchurio: asmon doesnt even play the game
[2:46:49] imrobk: @TimmyShoes I didn't say it made sense to the consumer, but increasing share holder value is how public companies increase profits.
[2:46:52] nikthevoker: i mean most of asmon viewers are lemmings, do you expect good takes? LUL
[2:46:54] vodkacran: @Axtin it's a bit hard to follow
[2:46:59] SlyMooseMan: SlyMooseMan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! I feel like Asmon's takes just get worse and worse every month that goes by.
[2:47:08] f3elsok: why is asmon still talking about the game when he quit like 3 years ago lol
[2:47:17] cavi_tv: Because he gets money
[2:47:19] baxter5569: because he needs money
[2:47:21] cavi_tv: For making those shit videos
[2:47:23] oOThugnastyOo: Is that same for awc? no tuning when tournys are happening?
[2:47:28] freelofear: theres 3 other modes you can raid, whats the issue
[2:47:28] vodkacran: @f3elsok he still makes a lot of money from it
[2:47:31] PurePain1337: PurePain1337 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:47:31] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy PurePain1337 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:47:44] Mhortai: They aren't designing the game for RTWF guilds, it's ONLY mythic. The rest of the game is pretty casual. @venruki
[2:47:47] BanthaBantha: I enjoy his perspective. Agree or not.
[2:47:50] tool_ateralus: makes sense
[2:47:54] SlyMooseMan: I like him too but I used to agree with everything, now I find myself cringing at some of his takes. I guess no one is perfect...
[2:48:22] tarth_100: I think Asmon means even after race to world first. They continue to nerf bosses the entire patch
[2:48:33] rethumtv: thats the same thing with PvP balance
[2:48:37] SilentRogue: soon it will be tested by AI and everyone is happy
[2:48:40] Axtin: id never expect a raid to come out and be perfect on arrival
[2:48:46] Mhortai: @SlyMooseMan Ya my view of Asmon used to be better, not he seems like the person who doesn't play the game much and is the angry GET OFF my lawn person.
[2:48:46] TimmyShoes: is doing pve worth it? i like it when pvp'ers don't have to pve
[2:48:49] vodkacran: @tarth_100 why shouldn't they?
[2:48:50] cavi_tv: @SilentRogue truuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[2:48:53] chrihorp: the world firsts brings huge hype value to the game in general.
[2:48:59] demtrollzZ: @SlyMooseMan Its generally a worrying sign if you agree with every single thing a very outspoken person says :P
[2:49:06] rembrandt89: @Axtin LUL
[2:49:06] savageruthless: it needs to change. its the same with pvp gladiator is just not possible for some people and its not fair. i worked my ass of to get 1800 this season and shuffle i should atleast recieve the mount. i dont care for the title but we should get the mount
[2:49:06] diblet25: luv ven gives a logical response then hits play " its cause they fucked up"
[2:49:08] belfastcl: which raiders, how many are they
[2:49:11] Bodify: @Axtin just balance it perfectly 4Head
[2:49:12] Evoca85: Mythic is meant to be hard. There is raid finder, normal, hard, and THEN Mythic.
[2:49:17] shameshady: Asmon is a content creator, he is very good at engaging people... his takes are often shooting from the hip... he often contradicts him self... he speaks with passion and get people fired up.. that is his job
[2:49:28] Saitistreamy: I wish they would implement a global PVP rating system, so that any PVP content effected the rating.
[2:49:29] ItsBees: As a raider, no it would suck
[2:49:33] phokingjoey: it's dumb there's 3 levels of raiding. waste of time
[2:49:34] rethumtv: @venruki yes, thats how classic is, you farm it for the gear
[2:49:35] oOThugnastyOo: alot of satisfaction when to killing a mythic boss
[2:49:50] Spaceberry_McDuck: @shameshady i can't take anybody seriously if they literally have roaches crawling on them while they stream
[2:49:51] freelofear: progression is more fun then just getting loot
[2:49:52] Acurarx: and software will operate differently in the hands of 100 people vs millions cuz it is going to experience use cases that weren’t account for. just from an outsider perspective
[2:49:52] Secretwombatbro: its weird for me that raids are mathmatically possible when they come out
[2:49:59] vodkacran: anyone that wants a mount for 1800 should just not idk that is crazy
[2:50:02] Secretwombatbro: because they felt impossible back in vanilla
[2:50:07] pragma90: it’s like adding inflation half way through the season so everyone doesn’t get gladiator week 1
[2:50:08] f3elsok: asmon takes about pve and pvp are literally "its too hard for me so make it easier"
[2:50:14] Secretwombatbro: i thought that was part of the charm
[2:50:17] Myth_The_Wolf: Real Venruki hours
[2:50:17] MisterThatDude: I’ve played WoW since it came out and I’ve never done a Mythic raid. Mythic raising was the end of raiding for me
[2:50:28] rembrandt89: mythic being too hard def kills guilds tho but thats a people problem
[2:50:28] Secretwombatbro: if normal is barely possible week 1 thatll give them something to do
[2:50:42] Zephn: I will say if your in a slow CE grind guild even if you manage to get CE every tier the chase items from the last 2 bosses feel meaningless once you beat them because the next tier is already about to be out by the time you finish prog
[2:50:44] shameshady: @Spaceberry_McDuck I think you shouldnt take him to serious anyway :) that was my point.. he fieres people up, he is not trying to spread the "word"
[2:50:51] belfastcl: @MisterThatDude that's his point, the whole raids scene revolves around the needs of a very small group of people
[2:50:54] imrobk: imagine paying $15 a month for something and expecting it to be perfect out of the box. some people are really out of touch.
[2:50:55] Saitistreamy: there are no people problems, there are only design problems
[2:50:58] Secretwombatbro: and just slap the icc buff
[2:50:58] Zephn: You don't get any time to feel powerful with the cool end boss items
[2:50:59] Kortey: That's why multiple difficulties exist tho
[2:51:02] Secretwombatbro: that gradually makes it easier
[2:51:08] gamem0re: i honestly don’t agree with this take at all but I also don’t PvE so what do I know.
[2:51:12] Mhortai: @venruki the crazy thing is most of the player base experience raiding through LFR. There is this crazy focus on mythic. Asking for Mythic to be nerfed is like asking for some kind of cap on arena so the top players don't have challenge or something.

[2:51:17] MisterThatDude: I think it’s bad for business if the majority of your players can’t beat the game
[2:51:20] gr_faux: I get his point but does he expect blizzard to put the fights out perfectly tuned?
[2:51:22] rethumtv: you skipped the beginning of this video, it has the real meat and potatoes of the post
[2:51:22] f3elsok: just raid on your difficulty when you have a problem with the hardest
[2:51:26] imrobk: It is fine if everyone can't do everything. Life isn't fair and neither is the internet.
[2:51:27] Hobblefoot: Exactly. Heroic for you and me and Mythic for them.
[2:51:40] Hobblefoot: That is a great point.
[2:51:47] Acurarx: I don’t like people like that to play with them.
[2:51:59] Mhortai: Blizzard said the majority of the players base experiences raids through LFR>
[2:52:02] chaps_86: Getting rank 1 in arena has to be harder than mythic raiding, I'm sure you would do fine Ven
[2:52:11] Secretwombatbro: that was the prestige before
[2:52:20] Secretwombatbro: being one of the few guilds clearing on the server
[2:52:24] willie_stroker_99: If you take the top pvp player and send them raiding mythic+ they will own it
[2:52:24] Saitistreamy: @chaps_86 getting glad is harder then mythic raiding
[2:52:30] Secretwombatbro: not everyone would
[2:52:30] ItsBees: My only issue with mythic is the 20 person lock, we have like 24 people in our guild and can't really do mythic without kicking people out Sadge
[2:52:37] Hobblefoot: He will say "Because the game is developed around Mythic and the 1%"    @venruki
[2:52:38] MisterThatDude: can you get BiS gear without doing mythic raising?
[2:52:39] heyweguccinow: skills have always been proven in pvp. pvpers can pve but most pvers cant pvp on high mmr
[2:52:43] Mhortai: @Saitistreamy Right now ya, not always though.
[2:52:48] tmiller87: get rid of mythic raiding and r1 and make glad 2k everyone gets a prize meta
[2:52:49] Evoca85: Arena is harder than mythic raiding imo. You can learn the mechanics on a website, then just go kill the boss.
[2:52:49] rembrandt89: Is'nt every game that has multiple difficulties like that though?
[2:52:50] Verothe3rd: it seems like at least part of the problem is that players get used to a certain level of achievement. once you do that - it’s hard to enjoy the game if you can’t repeat that level
[2:52:56] vodkacran: Everyone always wants to be "the best" but I've seen people that are happy with 1800 as opposed to gladiator. I think that should transfer to being m+ vs heroic raiders
[2:52:56] Robofat: I did mythic Uldir in bfa and the hardest part is to find full raid of good players who able to play every evening
[2:53:00] Saitistreamy: @Mhortai almost always. hall of fame is 5k people, most glad seasons dont have 5k glad
[2:53:24] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy harri180 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[2:53:25] Mhortai: @Saitistreamy More people do PvE though. So of course there is going to be more players in the HoF.
[2:53:39] f3elsok: i mean im not playing in 2.8k mmr in arenas because thats not my skill level so you also raid on your skill level, i dont see the problem here
[2:53:58] Saitistreamy: @Mhortai people find pve easier, the amount of people who step into an arena, and get obliterated and never do it again is super high
[2:54:06] Getblown: i completely disagree with asmongold's take here on out
[2:54:10] kheilas: they should stop making ferrraris because I can't buy one is his argument
[2:54:22] Robofat: @Evoca85 in 3s arena you are the 33% of succes in mythinc- just 5%
[2:54:24] Saitistreamy: Ive qued with people 5/8 mythic raid, who are like 1400 tops
[2:54:27] Getblown: the fact is the majority of players have played 10+ years
[2:54:36] imrobk: It sounds like he wants a lot of the game changed to fit his specific circumstances at the expense of the rest of the players who play differently.
[2:54:41] vodkacran: @Robofat what? make this make sense
[2:54:43] shameshady: It is the same as with Belluar... they make more money if they trash the game..
[2:54:47] f3elsok: @imrobk exactly
[2:55:03] satirically1: ive always had respect for the players who hit glad mmr, clear ce and get whatever the m+ rewards are
[2:55:09] Saitistreamy: @vodkacran you are 1/3rd of the team in arena, but 1 of 25 in mythic raid
[2:55:24] Evoca85: @Robofat I'm not talking about winning or success. I'm talking about jumping into it. I've played both game modes since they've been released, I personally find it easier to mythic raid than do 2100+ arenas.
[2:55:27] Hobblefoot: I don't find it interesting. I find it annoying and I think Asmond intentionally misrepresents things to his chat which is full of sycophants and people that clearly are susceptible to group think.
[2:55:27] vodkacran: @Saitistreamy that makes more sense, ty for clarifying
[2:55:53] Reminosity: why aren't you yellow? wow
[2:56:03] Vramii: Green lizzy burst is sweeeeet
[2:56:19] ItsBees: don't know what you're Dune Pog
[2:56:30] gr_faux: I woulda thought you played a lot of dev
[2:56:36] zerx_gg: im going 2 dune 2 2mrw
[2:56:36] vispnftw: absolute banger song
[2:56:48] vodkacran: @zerx_gg it's such a good movie
[2:57:12] rembrandt89: is dune 2 better then the 1st?
[2:57:23] Dizzlx: to me it seems like asmon takes a position and then perpetually thinks of ways to justify it
[2:58:04] Getblown: yep
[2:58:19] vodkacran: @rembrandt89 I would say they are about equal. I LOVED both of them, but everyone has different opinions.
[2:58:28] tmiller87: it dune matter what your name is
[2:58:37] MisterThatDude: they learned to hit the aff lock lolol
[2:58:45] ungodlyxdx: lock is so bad
[2:58:49] Skillcap: what is that title this dude have KEKW
[2:58:57] vodkacran: lol whispforms name title in game
[2:58:59] gr_faux: unburdened flight and crippling force pvp talents against melee and cash in stonks
[2:59:11] JonnyJoystick: Could it just be someone has a different opinion then you?
[2:59:13] ItsBees: Once he started pandering to the "everything I don't like is woke" crowd I've lost interest
[2:59:15] JonnyJoystick: Not you ven
[2:59:44] imrobk: @Hobblefoot Yeah I find his content is just so.. divisive and he's always too outraged about something. When I'm looking for entertainment i'm trying to wind down and chill, not get all worked up over things that don't really matter.
[3:00:03] Mhortai: @JonnyJoystick That is the case sometimes, but he is just wrong on somethings. He states his opinion as fact instead of opinion.
[3:00:07] Gajing: same @ItsBees had to put his video suggestions on ignore on youtube
[3:00:20] vodkacran: @imrobk what? you want to enjoy video game content? unreal
[3:00:27] cyborgdox: thats why pika get a lot of views his energy is always postive
[3:00:38] MisterThatDude: EY?!
[3:00:46] shameshady: when asmon were on PoddyC, he was more reasonable :) again.. he milks this .. every single streamer have reacted to his video.. Max went online last night only to react to asmon
[3:00:48] Mhortai: @ItsBees OMG all the WOKE is bad stuff is some of the most annoying stuff in existance.
[3:00:49] cyborgdox: and venruki is chill vibe
[3:01:17] Zephn: I really wish they didn't introduce Aug, it ruined devastation for me as someone who mainly does PvE content
[3:01:18] ungodlyxdx: WHAT ABOUT LETS GO WHISPFORM?
[3:01:26] Zephn: I just wanted to main dev
[3:01:53] Zephn: But now to play dev your being seen by your peers as willfully ignorant by not playing Aug instead
[3:02:23] Zephn: So I just play other specs now
[3:02:32] taywright23: new players are the ones that get discouraged the most imo. Some people try to help new players but over time I feel people are just plain mean and don’t want to help with raiding or arena

[3:11:03] Mhortai: @venruki JUST like arena/competitive PvP, everyone has a skill cap. Removing more challenging content from the game is a bad move. Just like not everyone can get glad/R1 everyone also can't kill mythic raid bosses. And that is fine. Just like not everyone can do Mage Tower. But Asmon loved mage tower. There seems to be this small vocal movement to remove the most competitive parts of wow for some reason.

[3:39:56] rvdsupremas: i truly hate the flame management as elemental
[3:39:58] vodkacran: bigdmg makes it work Kappa
[3:39:59] gjvl: All enhancement shaman needs to be competitive is MS, instant cast AoE stuns, a reliable root on a short CD, Hex to be instant cast, slight defensive buffs, non RNG burst cooldowns, and shorter CD gap closers...then it will be JUST as good as every other melee
[3:40:01] rvdsupremas: makes me so freking koekwous
[3:40:23] gr_faux: no more ms
[3:40:29] TimmyShoes: @vodkacran has he gotten glad? i noticed his solo rating is 500 points higher than 3s
[3:40:36] gr_faux: too many ms in game already
[3:40:39] FateIRL: they need to remove ms from every spec aside from warriors

[3:45:42] Tsuki_aka_Moon: Guys could anyone tell me how do I deal with shadow priests in SOLO and 2s? As arms, it feels to me like unkillable abomination
[3:45:44] cbates30: augmentation evoker pvp what that like
[3:45:45] Robofat: spam bombs
[3:45:45] gr_faux: ven just wants to play his frost mage I can respect that
[3:45:54] Nikademous: Surv hunter
[3:46:01] vortex071232: damn pres evoker is fun
[3:46:09] gr_faux: pres is so fun
[3:46:35] zacaries_: oh the new Asmon video where he says the RWF raiders made WoW bad
[3:46:49] ItsBees: wut
[3:46:56] zacaries_: yes
[3:47:01] freelofear: no they should be easy, is his point
[3:47:02] DegStaerian: No
[3:47:04] kreyzy8: no he's saying they should be easy
[3:47:05] Grimm303: hes saying they should be easier to start
[3:47:10] belvedee: Well he wants them to make it easier so they don't have to nerf.
[3:47:18] gr_faux: it’s that they release them way too difficult and then have to nerf them repeatedly
[3:47:19] nightmxz: He wants them to be easier and not get easier over time which then takes away from the achievement of killing them at all
[3:47:20] belvedee: He just wants the content to be ez so he can do it Kappa
[3:47:21] Skoorbals: you talked about this on the podcast right
[3:47:23] rethumtv: hes saying that gear should make the boss easier, not nerfs
[3:47:28] Chillmawxx: No, he's saying that nerfing is evidence of a disconnect in how challenging they think they need to make content
[3:47:28] gr_faux: for regular players to beat it
[3:47:31] Chillmawxx: I think
[3:47:35] wicked_wizurd: he think any nerfs is because a failure of design
[3:47:36] Shirey12: Asmon doesn't play, Dorki had to carry him so he can get his mount. Asmon complains because he can't get with the times.
[3:47:38] brolic_9k: they should nerf them aftewr world first faster
[3:47:46] storm_chaser_ron: that's a little extreme
[3:47:47] ItsBees: Yeah just do everything perfectly and know the future LUL
[3:47:50] storm_chaser_ron: I get the gist
[3:47:51] ItsBees: that's a L take
[3:47:51] nether696: true
[3:47:53] TheNutcracka: i disagree
[3:47:56] Bodify: that is literally what nerfs are tho, they fucked up
[3:48:00] Mhortai: Um. Mythic raids are still super hard for most of the player base even after the nerfs though?
[3:48:06] rvdsupremas: nerf dh
[3:48:12] storm_chaser_ron: @Bodify Not all nerfs are a fuck up lol
[3:48:17] brolic_9k: @Mhortai ^
[3:48:19] storm_chaser_ron: a 2% nerf isn't a "fuck up"
[3:48:22] cadillacseville: he is 100% correct
[3:48:23] Grimm303: but they can test with more gear
[3:48:30] kreyzy8: @ItsBees he's comparing to FF ultimates bosses which are basically never tuned after release
[3:48:38] chachio_dk: i think its more so to allow the late CE raiders to eventually get the kill after raiding for months
[3:49:36] Nikademous: Nikademous is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to venruki's community! They've gifted a total of 20 in the channel!

[3:49:43] kreyzy8: SL S1 people had 20k hp LUL
[3:49:44] Nikademous: Asmon is boring
[3:49:50] Runescale: I canceled my sub since no new content that we know of is coming, PvP isn't balanced and the communication is 0.
[3:49:50] Nikademous: Gimme that surv hunter
[3:49:59] cbates30: augmentation evoker
[3:50:00] Mhortai: @kreyzy8 comparing FF ultimate to mythic raiding a bad comparing. FF has no gear power creep
[3:50:03] ItsBees: LUL

[3:50:25] Necrolancer47: its going to make u 1% stronger
[3:50:25] gr_faux: stonks
[3:50:26] Shirey12: I think Asmon's take wanting 40 man raids to come back is a terrible idea.

[3:52:39] justjoshingyo: uh oh lol
[3:53:10] Skillcap: you need the fisting fury eagle thinghy. its your 4 set
[3:53:16] rvdsupremas: with set bonus. fury channelng is your main big dmg also
[3:53:20] Nateypww: idk if playing any class with no gear is a good idea
[3:53:21] brolic_9k: coordinated does a debuff i think
[3:53:24] justjoshingyo: fury of the eagle is 4 set so prob dont need it now
[3:53:28] ChilledsDogTreats: nah you basically got it already, grenades, stings, killshot if it procs, spam mongoose bite
[3:53:31] skez_live: ROFL
[3:53:33] rvdsupremas: eye of the hawk = range mongoose can hug pillar and atack ranged
[3:53:34] skez_live: ven is so sad
[3:53:39] skez_live: you guys gotta stop
[3:53:45] rvdsupremas: 2 spots to the right from your trinket
[3:53:46] Strive007: chackram, explosive shot, flanking and fury of the eagle is your one shot
[3:53:48] Jihnn: Next stop is Vengeance Demon Hunter Kappa
[3:53:55] R1_Prototype: @gamem0re the big deal about conquest gear is you get to convert it to tier set. so you can have your tier and PvP gear. without conquest gear you’d have to wear the 450~ tier in PvP and give up 30 ilvl
[3:53:56] belfastcl: nice song

[3:54:25] Kujo_XX: Oh, fury is PvP
[3:54:54] rvdsupremas: show talents? :D u can when u do assault = reset cooldown on bombs. maybe beginner's friendly more. since u can play more range
[3:55:02] Skillcap: u get auto serpent when u use mongoose
[3:55:06] gamem0re: @r1_prototype lol I’m still in honor gear so I guess it’s pretty big difference lol
[3:55:11] Strive007: serpent sting is auto applied with talent

[3:56:20] gr_faux: probably not speced
[3:56:21] xChumster: i was watching an episode of the poddy c and saw you there and came here to say i havent lurked in a while but wanted to say hi to the wow ambassador

[3:57:10] Skillcap: why SV tho, go MM for the 1 shots KEKW
[3:57:19] Jihnn: @Skillcap The shuffle roulette has spoken
[3:57:24] Skillcap: oh oke
[3:57:35] Jarettol: do you have to pve to get 4 set for pvp?
[3:57:37] gr_faux: sv > mm

[3:57:54] justjoshingyo: que a skirmish warm up loll
[3:57:59] DveevD: that pet dont mortar strike?
[3:58:00] twntyon3: You sorta spam mongoose bite when you cast the first one for the buff, then refill energy when that kill command proc comes up
[3:58:03] Skillcap: in the Great Loa we trust
[3:58:21] R1_Prototype: @jarettol you actually CANT get your pvp set from pve. you’ll be giving up huge ilvl.
[3:58:31] wreckedgum: turn him up
[3:59:05] wreckedgum: must just be me
[3:59:17] Jarettol: how do you get 4 set for pvp then? I'm dumb apparently, lol
[3:59:29] Skoorbals: huh
[3:59:34] Mhortai: Asmon sounds like he doesn't know why Mythic raiding gets nerfed...
[3:59:59] rvdsupremas: the gearing progress sucks even its better then ever. iuts still horrendous
[4:00:03] Nikademous: So put the game out and never touch it kekw
[4:00:04] rvdsupremas: pvp <
[4:00:15] Mhortai: Mythic raiding on release is tuned for like 4 guilds. And then gets nerfed so normal mythic raid guilds can do it.
[4:00:24] Skillcap: people will always min max at classic and at retail... how it works
[4:00:31] sind233: @Mhortai which is the right way to do it
[4:00:35] skez_live: raiding in classic is dumb
[4:00:39] skez_live: but w.e
[4:00:49] mindrazor: Listening to Asmon is exhausting
[4:00:56] blake59: i remember a guild clearing onyxia with 10 druids to root all the adds and just ignore that mechanic
[4:00:56] privx: classic players will spend hours getting buffs so that the raids will be completed 10 min faster
[4:00:57] Mhortai: @sind233 Ya I don't have an issue with it. But Asmon makes it sounds like they do it to just make it easier.
[4:01:08] Hippwn: people also don't think the same in games as they did 20 years ago so kind of silly to compare
[4:01:28] Skoorbals: does asmon even play wow still? doesnt discredit his opinion but
[4:01:33] brewsome34: There is no escaping Asmongold
[4:01:35] Mhortai: @Hippwn 100%
[4:01:42] belfastcl: @Mhortai I think his whole point is that no piece of content should be tuned for 4 guilds
[4:01:54] Nikademous: Cmon queeeee
[4:02:03] Nikademous: Poppppp
[4:02:47] Mhortai: @belfastcl It's only tuned that way for like a week though. Where most of the CE guilds are still gearing in heroic.
[4:03:02] selkethomg: players who complain about mythic nerfs arent even at those bosses when theyre nerfed, and the player who are want to beat it pre-nerf
[4:03:06] Bodify: could be due to Myslot, i think that does keybinds too no?
[4:03:23] sind233: @Mhortai gearing and progressing lmao

[4:03:55] zerx_gg: people already struggling to get 20 players
[4:03:57] Tizbit: should go to 8 man raids
[4:03:59] wackpoetic: every time Asmon grandstands about WoW it's pretty apparent that he doesn't play anymore
[4:04:02] Dalfire: NotLikeThis
[4:04:05] gr_faux: he’s done cooking it’s fried
[4:04:07] chachio_dk: im sure his chat agrees
[4:04:07] Skoorbals: i love asmon but boomer moment
[4:04:07] Mhortai: He wants WoW to die honestly. With that take rofl
[4:04:12] Zlipps: The fact the game has lasted 20 years is great. Time to put it in the bin though and another game come out that replaces it.

[4:04:23] Somanie: helllllllll no
[4:04:24] ChilledsDogTreats: 40 man raids? My pc already chugs in bgs, I don't want to do 40 man raids
[4:04:24] Mhortai: It's cool
[4:04:25] Skillcap: well Asmon raids will have 240 people lining to raid, its easy for him to find good raiders
[4:04:26] sind233: Why stop at 40
[4:04:29] Nikademous: Zlipps blizzard doesn't make new ips
[4:04:29] sind233: Why not 80
[4:04:29] Somanie: it's hard enough getting 20
[4:04:30] sind233: kekL
[4:04:30] swolecolemole: getting 40 people on the same schedule is very realistic and great for the game
[4:04:34] Runescale: I raided mythic in warlords with 10 people (because it was possible to run 10 or 20?) and I had a blast

[4:05:03] kreyzy8: this is peak Asmon logic
[4:05:05] R1_Prototype: and 40% more aids is the difference
[4:05:06] Mhortai: It hard to organize now, so just make it harder - Amsongold
[4:05:08] storebraad: Asmongold is not a wow player anymore he just likes to talk. He stoped raiding in Ulduiar because - and i quote, ppl gave him aids and he could not take it anymore. And then talk about 40 ppl....
[4:05:09] zerx_gg: I do my best

[4:05:19] swolecolemole: lmao
[4:05:27] Somanie: I want the flexible boss hp bars from normal and heroic, in mythic. no 20 requirement NOPERS
[4:05:29] zerx_gg: PeepoFinger
[4:05:36] blueberrypieface: PeepoFinger
[4:05:37] Skillcap: PeepoFinger

[4:06:15] Zlipps: @Nikademous yeah I was thinking more so of the riot MMO or Blue Protocol.
[4:06:16] GiiGa07: Ez clap supa
[4:06:21] zerx_gg: Hmm
[4:06:23] Mhortai: omg
[4:06:23] Grimm303: Pepega
[4:06:28] sked420: lol
[4:06:28] sind233: 5head
[4:06:30] sind233: lmao
[4:06:33] kreyzy8: back to 2004 EZ
[4:06:33] Mhortai: What
[4:06:34] Teslightning: i suggest that asmongold needs to clean hes carpet in the first place before he give any advice in terms of someone needs to change any mechanics about wow or any game
[4:06:34] TheNutcracka: just make a new game at this point
[4:06:35] noirlol: NPCgold
[4:06:45] storebraad: i agree about the addons. What shouild be in wow, should be in wow, 3rd party software GONE 100% i agree
[4:07:01] Scotch1230: I mostly agree with Asmon, but I'm a bit jaded
[4:07:06] PapaBeks: 100% agree with Asmon on this
[4:07:06] Skillcap: remove addons Madge
[4:07:07] sked420: hes out of touch the only time asmon actually plays wow he has hundreds of people following him around
[4:07:14] gr_faux: agree on addons
[4:07:25] Runescale: I agree
[4:07:31] grimmjowhd: I just started pvping this season, and havent really played wow, i honestly didnt mind installing the addons, it wasnt too much work to figure out what was essential
[4:07:33] Mhortai: @venruki I think there are to many addons, and that needs to be addressed, but removing all addons is kind of an insane take to me.
[4:07:33] rommoiran: natty lmao
[4:07:36] Skillcap: everyone agrees on that except the top 0.1% sweats
[4:07:42] Scotch1230: less addons is better imo
[4:07:52] Taevenx: what if we suck with addons? asking for a friend Kappa
[4:07:59] zerx_gg: BadTake
[4:08:01] Runescale: come on
[4:08:02] Scotch1230: lmao
[4:08:05] ungodlyxdx: i'd be ok with removing these kinds of addons but to be honest there  are too many buttons/skills across all the classes and specs. we need these kinds of addons
[4:08:10] sind233: LMA O
[4:08:11] swolecolemole: game would be so much more interactive without addons, no cap
[4:08:12] Vendrek: Fair...the one type of addon I absolutely dispise is the partial bot script addons that tell the player what button to press next...
[4:08:16] Foe009: I think Asmon is too much from him
[4:08:18] Foe009: wtf
[4:08:19] Bodify: Add DR's and remove all trash auras and a lot is done for the game tbh and addons could be safely removed (at least every combat one)
[4:08:24] nightmxz: Hell yeah delete every addon I'm down
[4:08:27] rommoiran: that would be so wild for pvp, but awesome
[4:08:28] BanthaBantha: the game would be better off without addons
[4:08:28] nightmxz: All natty let's go
[4:08:30] sind233: Delete wow
[4:08:31] rommoiran: level playing field
[4:08:33] zerx_gg: we made the wrong person famous Sadge
[4:08:34] Skoorbals: Maybe a type of raiding mode that doesnt give higher loot past a point and is just for competitive pushing? like keys past a certain level?
[4:08:40] Foe009: he is too agressive
[4:08:43] gr_faux: details stays
[4:08:43] R1_Prototype: the game would be soooo much more fun without addons. but the game does SUCH a terrible job at providing you critical information. they are absolutely necessary
[4:08:44] ChilledsDogTreats: scoreboards in game
[4:08:45] juanklolan: should I be blind inpvp
[4:08:46] sind233: Recount in 2024 kekL
[4:08:46] skwiglz: what about ui addons?
[4:08:48] Mhortai: @nightmxz even the ones that are just UI customization?
[4:08:48] gr_faux: everything else out
[4:08:55] DveevD: not worth playing without detalis
[4:08:56] Mhortai: macros?
[4:08:58] Applezbtw: conditional macros
[4:08:58] SwiisH_Tv: i think WA is the big culprit
[4:09:00] Mhortai: bagnon?
[4:09:00] nachtgaste: just delete Asmongold or just move him to classic permanently
[4:09:01] sniper_guy00: If anything weakauras can get tuned down some
[4:09:02] Foe009: stupid ideas IMO
[4:09:02] Teslightning: 2$ pizza delete it
[4:09:07] ChilledsDogTreats: I'm with him tbh, no addons, at all. I'd be completely fine with it
[4:09:12] michaelss_: people are such details gamers, if you play diamond ice it doesn’t show up in cc and I had a healer call me bad cause I don’t cc when I legit didn’t on cd lol
[4:09:13] SwiisH_Tv: most add ons im ok with its the WAs that are to much
[4:09:17] jporter_: they wont ever delete addons
[4:09:17] michaelss_: I said ok details gamer
[4:09:20] michaelss_: use your eyes
[4:09:25] nightmxz: @Mhortai I mean I like that people can customize their UI (add the UI customization options in game) but also fk all addons :)
[4:09:27] Nikademous: Queeee where r uuuu
[4:09:34] Bodify: The dragonflight UI revamp was laughable
[4:09:34] kreyzy8: I think most people agree specifically on combat addons
[4:09:35] Vendrek: @ChilledsDogTreats I think removing scoreboards would make a lot of people upset and leave.
[4:09:36] sind233: I fucking hate addons
[4:09:41] skez_live: totall agree
[4:09:42] kreyzy8: its the non-combat stuff people disagree
[4:09:51] ChilledsDogTreats: No I mean the scoreboards in game are fine
[4:09:53] Mhortai: @nightmxz You are just against information ones I think though.
[4:09:54] wackpoetic: What's funny is Asmon basically quit Dragonflight because he had to re-do his UI at launch
[4:09:54] dakila24: i just want totems to be easier to click without addons
[4:09:56] strafekey: I think the game is too immersed with addons and at this point it would have a negative effect to do something like that
[4:10:00] spameris123: currently its not possible to play  pvp without addons
[4:10:04] Nateypww: I can’t get a friend into wow because it’s way too intense
[4:10:04] ChilledsDogTreats: you don't need details to tell you how much you're doing at that very moment
[4:10:19] R1_Prototype: @swiish_tv functionally they are no different. so you can’t pick one or the other.
[4:10:27] Vendrek: @ChilledsDogTreats <3
[4:10:28] Mhortai: I would argue they don't make you better lol
[4:10:38] zen_oni_shinobi: i'm back friends, just woke up from a pretty epic nap
[4:10:51] Mhortai: Liquid and Echo also have fucking teams that do weakauras etc for them lol
[4:11:12] zerx_gg: cant lie, game runs really smooth without addons
[4:11:17] nightmxz: @Mhortai Tbh I think the information ones are important because the base UI is so bad, look at your buffs at any random moment and there's 3+ trash buffs to clutter it up. It's impossible to track everything on your own without them
[4:11:27] R1_Prototype: addons don’t make you better?….. what?
[4:11:27] gr_faux: always laugh when he try’s to discreetly pick his nose
[4:11:42] Scotch1230: What if they made a completely separate retail client that didn't allow addons, would you play it?
[4:11:54] SparxTheDragon: taking weeks to loot legendary meanwhile some alt from LFR gets it :(
[4:11:54] Grimm303: ya I think so
[4:11:56] Foe009: just a reminder, Asmon is a no life PVE player
[4:11:56] Vendrek: ye
[4:11:56] gr_faux: no more splitting
[4:11:57] Skoorbals: ok but rogue daggers in cata were annoying to get :(
[4:11:58] skwiglz: yup
[4:11:58] xChumster: yes
[4:12:00] zacaries_: yes
[4:12:00] ItsBees: you can but it's so low it's basically 0
[4:12:02] skwiglz: but they wont drop for me
[4:12:03] privx: yes but its very tiny chance
[4:12:04] Taevenx: insanely low drop chance
[4:12:05] ChilledsDogTreats: yeah, last patches one for Evoker, and this one
[4:12:06] gr_faux: wow is too split up as it is
[4:12:08] Mhortai: Ya, it's rare though @venruki
[4:12:13] Mhortai: I had to farm heroic for it
[4:12:17] xChumster: they fixed the % chance now
[4:12:20] xChumster: so its higher
[4:12:30] Vendrek: Personally don't think they should not drop from LFR and Normal
[4:12:40] SparxTheDragon: is legendary system really ruined the season for me
[4:12:46] Mhortai: Legendaries are only a requirement for raiding because players make it that way lol
[4:12:48] GiiGa07: Supa on streak
[4:12:59] PapaBeks: he's spot on imo
[4:13:12] wackpoetic: I wonder what amount of time is higher: Asmon playing Dragonflight, or Asmon talking about WoW during Dragonflight
[4:13:26] SwiisH_Tv: Speaking of mop cloak why can i not transmog it with its effect still?
[4:13:30] zacaries_: he talks about "well fare legendaries" but he loves Legion. That xpac was nothing but well fare legendaries
[4:13:35] Mhortai: @wackpoetic He barely plays it at all.
[4:13:44] PapaBeks: @wackpoetic this is also spot on
[4:14:02] zacaries_: FF
[4:14:08] Scotch1230: granblue fantasy, I think
[4:14:12] R1_Prototype: @swiish_tv I just still put the actual cloak on when I wanna flex on people XD
[4:14:27] Vendrek: I love Thunderfury, Ateish, and the rogue daggers...the questlines and building them were the best experiences IMO.
[4:14:39] Mhortai: Omg it was only expected to have it or required because players do that. You don't need thunderfury to clear the easy mode raids in classic lol
[4:14:57] SwiisH_Tv: @R1_Prototype its just weird you can mog other legos now but not that one... i love the effect so much
[4:14:58] 5tarchild: A WHOLE LOT
[4:15:06] sniper_guy00: that sounds like a LOT of nostalgia
[4:15:06] rvdsupremas: long queu tho
[4:15:10] ferahgok: @Mhortai This is true but you can't deny he's played a metric F ton up until this expansion. You can't invalidate his opinion on game design just because he hasn't played the most recent WoW expansion
[4:15:11] 5tarchild: bro who tf wanna go back to classic where u have to drink 50 times to complete a simple duel?
[4:15:14] waelrick: he is trapped in nostalgia when it comes to wow
[4:15:16] DanielMieckTV: !ui
[4:15:16] Nightbot: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfG0y7tGgzcwaaZOoaeZAyALulpHUaAHfH2wkaJ6pL0/edit?usp=sharing
[4:15:25] hunchurio: i feel like ive disagreed with almost all he's said
[4:15:25] sind233: For sure
[4:15:27] diblet25: you are but so am i
[4:15:30] zacaries_: just wait till he gets to the PvP part of the video
[4:15:32] hunchurio: he wants the game to go back to when he was 14
[4:15:34] Secretwombatbro: that wouldnt fly in todays game economy
[4:15:44] Vendrek: I did the Rogue Dagger Legendary and did it when it was live. Best questline in game.
[4:15:45] Secretwombatbro: it was kinda neat when servers were a few thousand people
[4:15:47] R1_Prototype: @swiish_tv yeah they should change it. I have like 6 cloaks or something. and those effects were dope
[4:15:49] TimmyShoes: what did you think of legion when gear didn't matter for pvp?
[4:15:50] Grimm303: go back to legion legendaries
[4:15:51] wackpoetic: TL;DR of Asmon's opinion of WoW: He doesn't like retail, he likes classic, he wishes retail was more like classic. But he doesn't play either OMEGALUL
[4:15:52] Secretwombatbro: and you knew the people that got cool stuff
[4:15:55] storebraad: Why is it nostalgia tho? Legion gave us all leggy weapons and EVERYBODY loved it and love it until today
[4:16:03] Mhortai: @ferahgok Did he play slands a lot? I dont think he did. He can have opinions, but again he paints them as FACT with no real info to back some of the stuff he says.
[4:16:07] Secretwombatbro: and it was always drama
[4:16:21] Secretwombatbro: who left the guild, who quit, who sold their account
[4:16:47] sind233: People like this who get funneled gear and rare items wanna have items that are rare to come by so they can be famous on the server, thats such an boomer mindset
[4:16:55] Mhortai: How does that happen though? Never nerfed? rofl
[4:17:21] SwiisH_Tv: Hey @venruki can you talk to your big wig connections and get mop lego mog effect put in game. cheers mate SeemsGood
[4:17:32] ItsBees: finally a take that's good
[4:17:32] Foe009: never going to happen, addons create kind of community and interest to the game. Meh ideas from Asmon
[4:17:32] ItsBees: yes
[4:17:34] Skoorbals: every addon?
[4:17:34] ItsBees: it's a nightmare
[4:17:35] chachio_dk: yeah
[4:17:36] PapaBeks: yes
[4:17:37] sniper_guy00: every once in a while
[4:17:37] isseswagger: yep
[4:17:37] Scotch1230: I would definitely play a client that didn't allow addons. PvP would be so much better on average.
[4:17:37] Vendrek: yes
[4:17:38] Grimm303: ish
[4:17:39] R1_Prototype: yeah
[4:17:43] Magi_Spellbreaker: kinda
[4:17:46] brolic_9k: consecration
[4:17:49] Secretwombatbro: imagine every mage effect is earthen totem
[4:17:50] Ronsimus: yes it is
[4:17:52] cadillacseville: not always intentional, mostly bad design
[4:17:52] Secretwombatbro: you just cant see it
[4:17:53] ChilledsDogTreats: kinda yeah, one boss in particular, Nymue
[4:17:53] swolecolemole: oh yea
[4:17:54] strafekey: Asmon is disconnected from current wow gameplay
[4:17:55] chachio_dk: i remember Castle Nathria had that
[4:17:56] Kujo_XX: Taking away awareness and automation AND doubling the raid size sounds like chaos
[4:17:59] ItsBees: The Nymue fight
[4:18:01] bonjourdaisy: Lol yeah nymue
[4:18:02] husquatch: Nymue
[4:18:02] Secretwombatbro: not mage, damage
[4:18:05] wackpoetic: was Sludgefist like that?
[4:18:06] SparxTheDragon: does someone remember the lines from sire?
[4:18:06] BanthaBantha: the game experience as a whole would be better without addons.
[4:18:07] isseswagger: lizard boss purple swirls and purple floor
[4:18:13] Kujo_XX: Can you imagine getting 40 people to manage mechanics in 2024 without addons?
[4:18:18] chachio_dk: sludgefist, sire daddy as well
[4:18:19] SparxTheDragon: the lines from sire were the same color as the ground
[4:18:20] Holtan3111: yes, remove all addons please
[4:18:23] hunchurio: i do agree with the no addons
[4:18:24] TimmyShoes: they can't even get rid of bots, they aren't going to get rid of addons
[4:18:29] Vendrek: RWF the players were changes so many graphic settings to be able to see all of the mechics.
[4:18:32] belfastcl: would be easier to onboard new players too, which is part of the point he is trying to make in an odd way
[4:18:33] ferahgok: @Secretwombatbro Yea I still hate earthen to this day. Mainly because I don't play with weak auras lol. I shouldn't have to download and addon to see such an important spell easier
[4:18:52] noukee: pvp will be better without addons as well, without weakauras
[4:18:55] gr_faux: Miss the good old days where different classes had specific jobs during a fight. like kiting slimes on a hunter in naxx in wrath
[4:19:05] ItsBees: nope
[4:19:07] 5tarchild: nobody ever said that
[4:19:10] zacaries_: no
[4:19:12] waelrick: no
[4:19:14] 5tarchild: asmon speaking with 10k dollar pc yeah sure frame issues
[4:19:18] zerx_gg: only in 40v40 scenarios
[4:19:19] Grimm303: lots of weakaruas & shit kills some peoples memory
[4:19:20] Ronsimus: no? i have 8 fps in rated bgs
[4:19:21] nuri_supreme: ofc, nyume encounter for example
[4:19:26] chachio_dk: Sire denathrius had a hotfix to change the colors of the swirlies on the ground
[4:19:29] nuri_supreme: or whatever her name is
[4:19:35] jporter_: i am a boomer, but i am very over this particular boomers video
[4:19:39] maenkins: this is mainly a raid take
[4:19:45] ItsBees: Pog
[4:19:48] gr_faux: let’s goooo
[4:19:48] rvdsupremas: hahaha 1900 as first
[4:19:49] Nikademous: Finally
[4:19:49] TheNutcracka: in battlegrounds and raids i drop frames alot. but my system is 6 yrs old
[4:19:50] rvdsupremas: like always
[4:19:52] zacaries_: KEKW
[4:19:56] Nikademous: Crutches
[4:19:59] Robofat: new toon is probably 1600 by default
[4:20:01] Nikademous: U don't need them
[4:20:04] SwiisH_Tv: is this a challenge ?
[4:20:22] Hobblefoot: I AM SO EXCITED ... One of my favorite specs.  You will own.
[4:20:24] GiiGa07: Mm is fun
[4:20:26] Nikademous: Muahahaha
[4:20:27] SwiisH_Tv: wishful thinking
[4:20:27] coke_vanilla: this is the start of survival 2400 challenge
[4:20:33] SlyMooseMan: Wishful thinking
[4:20:34] nightmxz: Kill command = your builder, mongoose bite = your spender, bomb = good damage (your C bind) and your #1 key is a gap closer that also hits hard
[4:20:35] sind233: How hard can it be when bicmex does it Kappa
[4:20:42] SparxTheDragon: no mages to be eaten
[4:20:43] gr_faux: pvp talents you using?
[4:20:44] wackpoetic: let's see that mmr

[4:21:04] nightmxz: I've never played the spearhead build before so idk LUL
[4:21:04] Skoorbals: i tried healing for the first time the other day and first game was 3 demon hunters
[4:21:06] Kujo_XX: Glizy gonna give you the whole thing!
[4:21:06] justjoshingyo: 50 yard charge
[4:21:07] gr_faux: use it as a gap closer
[4:21:09] thisisthotcaller: kinda some dam, mostly gpa closer
[4:21:13] nightmxz: also Shift-R is a big burst button too

[4:50:55] Applezbtw: you were hunted by a hunter who specializes in demons LUL
[4:51:02] Nikademous: It is
[4:51:13] sorostrike: They tried to protest, the government just enacted the emergencies act and froze bank accounts

[4:51:18] Frannzz: Most people dont understand the carbon tax and how it works and they just get mad when they dont actually know how it works at all
[4:51:21] Nikademous: But suicide isn't really funny
[4:51:32] wackpoetic: It could be worse, you could have the US government
[4:51:37] Locturnal_TV: instead of helping your own citizens your government should give away billions to people illegally entering your country. Like us here
[4:51:47] williwhite94: @Nikademous yeah it def kills the vibe..
[4:51:50] Hobblefoot: I thought all your troubles started when those darn truck drivers tried to take over your government.
[4:52:13] Frannzz: every 3 months canadians get money back and for 80% of canadians they actually get more money than they spent on the carbon tax
[4:52:16] Hobblefoot: @Locturnal_TV Someone is a Biden fan!
[4:52:24] hellotwice: @Frannzz yep lol
[4:52:36] ItsBees: Can we literally talk about anything else other than politics before this derails
[4:52:55] Shirey12: @venruki You made good points with max on the PoddyC about SoD. I agree 100% as someone that did naxx in the 2019 classic onward. I came back to retail because im burnt too.

[4:53:01] jporter_: lets talk about survial hunter
[4:53:17] williwhite94: ts talk about when yall think the season ends ? a month ? 2 months
[4:53:22] Magottx: I'm really excited to listen to that pod while i train in a bit
[4:53:35] zachgamegodx: @itsbees ye there’s some politics andies that wait for the moment to turn it into a politics discussion
[4:53:41] sorostrike: it's definitely not true
[4:53:46] TimmyShoes: @ItsBees pineapple on pizza is an abomination and anyone who orders it should be drawn and quartered
[4:53:48] FateIRL: not true
[4:54:07] Feracks: Zing
[4:54:11] LeroyTavis: I definitely like it when people take my money and promise to give it back 3 months later with no interest
[4:54:14] zachgamegodx: ven just wants a cheap avocado
[4:54:20] Nikademous: It's sex panther
[4:54:21] Shirey12: If anyone didn't catch Venruki on the PoddyC, it's worth the watch. I believe Max's theory with SoD's ties on buildup for TWW.
[4:54:22] ItsBees: @TimmyShoes I disagree but it's better than any political takes LUL
[4:54:30] Nikademous: 60% of the time it works 100%
[4:54:34] TimmyShoes: @ItsBees fair
[4:54:38] Frannzz: I at no point said I support or think its good. Just informing how it works
[4:54:45] Frannzz: I personally dont like it
[4:54:45] Locturnal_TV: can someone link the podcast
[4:54:47] Hockens: ink the pod?
[4:54:55] Nikademous: I've never seen that data
[4:54:56] zachgamegodx: haga
[4:54:56] williwhite94: @TimmyShoes you should try a mayonnaise  and banana sandwich ? im not kidding its so good
[4:54:57] atoker: @Frannzz help us make food cheaper in canada, and reduce our taxes... how can I get my carbon tax cheque?
[4:55:11] ItsBees: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9J-YbC1IHI the podcast for anyone who wants to watch
[4:55:13] Hobblefoot: I am not excited about the new talents in the next expansion.  I am not sure why but they just feel so blah.
[4:55:25] Frannzz: You get it every 3 months @atoker
[4:55:27] TimmyShoes: @williwhite94 you need Jesus. and I'm not even religious. MAYO and BANANA?!?!?!
[4:55:28] solipsis89: Frannzz is right, its like 8 out of 10 households that get more back in rebates
[4:55:35] wackpoetic: I like hearing people's political takes. The thing you have to remember though is that it's the internet and to not give credence to anything that you do see/hear
[4:55:35] sorostrike: Quarterly returns for an individual are around $134 dollars
[4:55:46] sorostrike: thats maybe a tank of gas
[4:55:46] atoker: @Frannzz currently I'm not getting one and I live in canada
[4:55:47] zachgamegodx: @itsbees plz start banning ppl
[4:55:53] zachgamegodx: this is getting outta hand
[4:56:01] Nikademous: But on every good that goes up
[4:56:02] williwhite94: @TimmyShoes i thought the same thing but i gave it a try its sweet and tangy, apparently elvis loved these things lol
[4:56:03] Frannzz: If you take time to look it up youll find out for yourself but not a big deal. Like I said I dont really like it much but facts matter
[4:56:23] Hobblefoot: @solipsis89 Rebates?  Does that require applications, and all sorts of paperwork that confuses people, like for my sterio?
[4:56:27] TimmyShoes: @williwhite94 i know elvis liked peanut butter, banana and bacon. i tried that, actually delicious. but mayo? that's just too far
[4:56:28] ItsBees: Yeah can you guys argue the political stuff in dms
[4:57:02] Magottx: okie
[4:57:13] BickenBone: how do the nameplates on the totems change colors?
[4:57:19] williwhite94: @TimmyShoes tbh i cant deny its def weird lol i havent met another person that will try i have payed a few freinds to try and only a few did but they said they wouldnt go out of there way to make it lol

[4:57:59] Frannzz: If you have auto deposit for your taxes and stuff it will just get auto deposited
[4:58:02] sorostrike: @solipsis89 thats false lol
[4:58:04] StromicusRex: / w bees i just think red's a cooler color really
[4:58:07] Hobblefoot: You have to fill out the application. Duh.  You can find it on your government website. I wish I had the link.  Where did I put that link.
[4:58:15] Nikademous: Grocery are like 400 a week
[4:58:20] zachgamegodx: holy shit
[4:58:20] Frannzz: I get mine auto deposited. You can go on the CRA website they track all the money they give you there
[4:58:22] CrazyJoeDavola57: only 1 person per household gets it
[4:58:23] zachgamegodx: this chat man

[4:59:57] Nikademous: Same
[5:00:07] Nikademous: I hate pineapple on pizza
[5:00:15] zachgamegodx: @frannzz what provokes you to interject in a twitch gaming stream about such topics?

[5:45:33] yippey_: Holy shit RukiFeral stream
[5:45:40] LordRatigan: Toxic
[5:45:41] Schwenkyytv: snupy is a 2s man now
[5:45:52] zachgamegodx: snupy doesnt do shuffle or 3's anymore rlly
[5:45:54] zachgamegodx: just convoke 2's
[5:46:09] ent3n: blizz should just steal how talents look on here lol
[5:46:12] willie_stroker_99: Yeah, that's the new meta
[5:46:16] zachgamegodx: thats a convoke buiild
[5:46:22] zachgamegodx: u shouldnt play that in shuffle
[5:46:27] ferahgok: if you don't want to play lunar inspiration(moonfire) bit another point in the tiger's fury talent
[5:46:38] williwhite94: convoke can still oneshot but u need to LOS all other players before useing
[5:46:40] ferahgok: also don't use blood talens if you want easy mode
[5:46:40] zachgamegodx: if it doesnt get stopped its insane
[5:46:41] tomjb91: Ye it one shots
[5:46:47] Schwenkyytv: i dont think you need to play moonfire or swarm anymore
[5:46:54] willie_stroker_99: Convoke is for 2v2
[5:46:59] skwiglz: a lot of people still play moonfire
[5:47:05] skwiglz: its no energy to consume
[5:47:19] gr_faux: big bites
[5:47:24] gr_faux: that’s what I play haha
[5:47:35] zachgamegodx: u can push in all forms bro
[5:47:43] zachgamegodx: thats a 2's build for sure it has off healing stuff
[5:47:57] skwiglz: using feral frenzy increases damage
[5:47:58] jukeandnuke: energy pool i thought, but haven't touched feral in ages
[5:48:00] zachgamegodx: theresa really simple no keybind build
[5:48:03] Yamikix: Hi Ven
[5:48:04] zachgamegodx: low keybind
[5:48:07] Schwenkyytv: you dont need moofire or swarm its only like a 2% damage increase
[5:48:13] Schwenkyytv: and it saves binds
[5:48:23] ferahgok: play lion's strength if you don't want to maintain blood talons buff
[5:48:30] willie_stroker_99: Well, ask the guy who chose it, want me tho
[5:48:41] R1_Prototype: hot take. any of the talents in the druid tree, class tree, should be useable in your main spec form.
[5:48:43] Yamikix: o he's gonna try feral!?
[5:49:07] FateIRL: change your cat form at the barber
[5:49:14] Skillcap: that queue time is brutal
[5:49:34] zachgamegodx: this is the most brainless feral build u can play https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/feral/DAAAOVFAZRUVFFaRRAQCRA
[5:49:41] zachgamegodx: it makes it so u dont carea bout blood talons or thrash
[5:49:48] ferahgok: ideally clone when you have 5 combo points so that you can get back to back bites
[5:49:51] Schwenkyytv: yes play zachs build
[5:49:54] Schwenkyytv: for new ferals
[5:50:01] ferahgok: Wild Attunement PVP talent makes cyclone OP
[5:50:07] skwiglz: the clone into feral frenzy increases damage and gives u two finishers
[5:50:09] zachgamegodx: oh ok
[5:50:10] vultii: wild attunement pvp talent is the one for cyclone
[5:50:13] kursewalker: Do you want the AoE spam buid?
[5:50:17] xdarkbaconx: Makes your next finisher also cast your frenzy
[5:50:51] zachgamegodx: u dont need to no, that's jsut to generate blood talons
[5:50:52] kursewalker: no moonfire
[5:50:53] ferahgok: nah don't need moonfire
[5:50:55] kursewalker: moonfire bad
[5:51:09] Schwenkyytv: moonfire is like a small dps increase and a ranged combo point builder but isnt worth the hassle if you are new to feral
[5:51:12] repsac1442: lol ven becomes number one feral
[5:51:13] zachgamegodx: play the tthing that applies thrash when u shred

[5:51:20] kursewalker: Rakem adaptive,Frenzy, rip
[5:51:22] zachgamegodx: its called "thrashing claws"
[5:51:23] ShakySeven: feral gaming
[5:51:33] zachgamegodx: so u dont needto keybind thrash
[5:51:52] SteLawBro: Ferals best opener is escape+logout+click where it says demonhunter. Then everything dies.
[5:52:01] ferahgok: thrash isn't really necessary though your bites do more damage for each bleed on the target so to that end it's helpful to put up
[5:52:22] Schwenkyytv: pressing thrash is like a 5% dps gain or something like that
[5:52:28] repsac1442: opener with stealth and your g keybind
[5:52:28] gr_faux: and thrash
[5:52:31] zachgamegodx: @ferahgok your thrash gets applied automacally when u take the thrashing claws talent
[5:52:32] repsac1442: open with eake
[5:52:34] fazedoritoss: to play feral u must press clone
[5:52:34] five_moke: when u gonna play rogue, venruki
[5:52:35] repsac1442: rake
[5:52:36] fazedoritoss: then press clone
[5:52:38] fazedoritoss: and clone some more
[5:52:45] zachgamegodx: @venruki play thrashing claws and u can drop thrash completely
[5:52:49] ShayTime: ven do you happen to have knowledge if there are even devs working on pvp anymore or if they all got fired?
[5:52:51] zachgamegodx: it auto applies it
[5:52:51] FateIRL: inc warrior dh outlaw lobby
[5:52:52] ferahgok: @zachgamegodx yea though you lost damage on your other builders. so i guess if you're going super ez mode it's worth taking
[5:53:00] repsac1442: don’t forget your tigers fury
[5:53:10] zachgamegodx: @ferahgok shred and slash do so little of ur dmg
[5:53:26] zachgamegodx: in pvp
[5:53:32] repsac1442: your g keybind from stealth then open rake
[5:53:40] Schwenkyytv: your damage comes from bites and feral frenzy
[5:53:52] ChilledsDogTreats: feral frenzy and adaptive swarm
[5:53:53] Schwenkyytv: the more clones you get the more feral frenzy you can do
[5:53:57] willie_stroker_99: Make your left talent tree more defensive
[5:53:57] zachgamegodx: ye the big thing u gotta makes ure ur tiger's fury on cd
[5:53:58] ferahgok: ideally clone when you  have full combo points for back to back big bites
[5:54:04] zachgamegodx: u dont have tigers fury up now
[5:54:17] zachgamegodx: now ur owning
[5:54:18] skwiglz: u can pump really well
[5:54:20] zachgamegodx: ur ready
[5:54:22] cyborg1141: 1234 ur palidan
[5:54:24] LordRatigan: You only bite while above 50 energy. Also try only use shred on clearcasts and Brutal Slash as normal builder. It costs significantly less energy
[5:54:25] repsac1442: for real got me wanting to play feral tonight
[5:54:32] skwiglz: \
[5:54:35] Robofat: energy
[5:54:39] repsac1442: and gives energy
[5:54:41] Schwenkyytv: you gain energy and more damage
[5:54:42] skwiglz: energy and energy regen
[5:54:46] Axtin: get rid of leader of the pack
[5:54:48] Axtin: its useless
[5:54:53] Axtin: play ferocious wound
[5:54:54] repsac1442: kinda like adrenaline rush in a way
[5:54:57] Schwenkyytv: thank god axtin is here
[5:55:04] willie_stroker_99: Fix your left talent tree to more defensive
[5:55:12] repsac1442: o axtin!
[5:55:14] zachgamegodx: lord axtin is here
[5:55:28] Axtin: ina shuff
[5:55:31] willie_stroker_99: Yeah
[5:55:35] repsac1442: definitely gonna let him take advice from axtin he’s a god
[5:55:45] repsac1442: make it a quick 6-0
[5:55:52] willie_stroker_99: Leave all the casters shit
[5:55:58] zachgamegodx: i was asking him questions, ihe either palys verdant heart or 2/2 feline swiftness
[5:56:00] PhoenixPhireX: Does Axtin ever stream? I'd watch that stream so hard.
[5:56:01] zachgamegodx: other than that ur build is good
[5:56:08] skwiglz: the other one helps u stay on target
[5:56:13] repsac1442: ven can I copy your build later?
[5:56:32] willie_stroker_99: You don't need moonkin
[5:56:36] zachgamegodx: u need it for clone sadly
[5:56:52] Mokuof300: i thought ferals had to offheal? no need for rejuv?
[5:57:00] zachgamegodx: look at the dire fixation talent, just keep an eye on it when ur bursting
[5:57:14] SteLawBro: I hated that SO much when i played druid. Having to pick useless things to get something decent.
[5:57:17] Axtin: yea what u have is fine rn
[5:57:25] Axtin: u could drop typhoon and mass root
[5:57:29] Axtin: if ur gonna forget to press them
[5:58:01] Robofat: blood talons?
[5:58:03] Axtin: also i would get rid of apex predator
[5:58:10] Axtin: and put that into another point in carnivorous
[5:58:15] five_moke: pump the hardest? play DH
[5:58:45] Axtin: ideally you land a clone when u have 5 combo points already
[5:58:46] kusoneko: press your cyclone keybind 4Head
[5:58:48] Axtin: then maim someone
[5:58:48] SweatyDaniels: ok
[5:58:58] zachgamegodx: i like apex bc i can just 5 pt bite to consume my wild attunement with the proc
[5:59:03] zachgamegodx: but ci 2/2 is better for sure
[5:59:05] cyborg1141: Cyclone again
[5:59:09] Izzythediscpriest: just be like the druids in my lobbies and forget you have cyclone
[5:59:11] Robofat: rage-rake-incarn-frenzy-rip-tresh-stealth-rake-bite-meld-rake-bite opener xD
[5:59:21] ferahgok: The wild attunement buff doesn't last long so make sure you use a finisher in that window
[5:59:22] Schwenkyytv: perfect
[5:59:23] Jenjiy0: Ven goes feral?!
[5:59:27] Jenjiy0: PogChamp
[5:59:29] zachgamegodx: @Axtin its ok if he does a 1 combo point fb or rip when hes bursting if he has no cps noi?
[5:59:36] xdarkbaconx: your maim applies feral frenzy, you dont need to press it again
[5:59:37] zachgamegodx: for wild attune
[5:59:40] SteLawBro: Just pretend like youre playing a melee afflic lock and cyclone=fear
[5:59:42] kusoneko: MOAR CLONES
[5:59:46] xdarkbaconx: clone causes your next combo point spender to cast feral frenzy :-)
[5:59:56] Schwenkyytv: incarn
[6:00:04] Axtin: ur getting passive combo pts during incarn
[6:00:06] MaddyLif3: incarn
[6:00:06] gr_faux: pop Incarn and tiger fury in stealth, rake stun, thrash, rip, restealth, rip stun brutal slash ferocious bite
[6:00:12] Axtin: and any combo point generator crit gives u 2 points
[6:00:20] Axtin: 3 during incarn
[6:00:34] zachgamegodx: your character looks the part of a feral druid
[6:00:44] Axtin: feral can play with any haste
[6:00:46] Axtin: any stats*
[6:00:52] Mokuof300: transmog needs work
[6:00:56] gr_faux: stack mastery
[6:00:57] repsac1442: really???
[6:01:02] Axtin: long as u dont have crit
[6:01:11] willie_stroker_99: You need mastery/Vers
[6:01:12] nomcarver00: demon cat is best cat
[6:01:16] repsac1442: I’m making a crit feral tonight
[6:01:18] repsac1442: lol 😂
[6:01:27] zachgamegodx: crit with leader of the pack build Kappa
[6:01:31] Jenjiy0: do it
[6:01:33] Haretic: please!
[6:01:34] Jenjiy0: no lol
[6:01:35] driftwood_tc: NOPERS
[6:01:38] willie_stroker_99: No
[6:01:38] repsac1442: I think you’d be insane bro
[6:01:40] Covlol: Need more ferals to play jungle with my surv hunter!
[6:01:41] Schwenkyytv: feral is like the 3rd highest melee in the top 500 3s
[6:01:44] Schwenkyytv: tied with ret
[6:01:45] gr_faux: you should
[6:01:46] repsac1442: yes it is super good
[6:01:48] Jenjiy0: but if you play it the devs might finally look at it
[6:01:49] zachgamegodx: its like boomy in terms of the potential to get bulied
[6:01:50] SweatyDaniels: double dps 2's
[6:01:53] Haretic: no, but youre miles better than me at every class so...
[6:01:57] gr_faux: it’s a- tier if played well imo
[6:02:01] Mokuof300: snupy is a pretty good feral
[6:02:01] Sithue: That's the fun part most of the times no but when it's good, Oh baby
[6:02:03] ferahgok: it's good if you're good.
[6:02:04] pr0x365: Sup Ven!
[6:02:10] cyborg1141: I see people walking around 2700 on it
[6:02:12] Axtin: also use heart for giga clones
[6:02:12] repsac1442: high skill ceiling
[6:02:24] cyborg1141: But mostly dead ferals
[6:02:27] repsac1442: I use shift F1
[6:02:28] zachgamegodx: giga clones
[6:02:33] Jenjiy0: @ferahgok fair point
[6:02:45] repsac1442: but I have razor naga
[6:02:47] Sithue: Really Really high skill celling
[6:02:59] lokifenrir1: What's your 4set @venruki
[6:03:07] deafnflaccid: made it back for the feral
[6:03:08] Schwenkyytv: i dont like being a cat the whole time
[6:03:15] zachgamegodx: play like a weenie until you fake a kick, use a clone, do a burst, play like a weenie
[6:03:16] repsac1442: does axtin stream ever??
[6:03:18] zachgamegodx: thats the playstyle
[6:03:19] FateIRL: why play feral and have a million binds when you can just be a dh and win with 2 buttons
[6:03:23] zachgamegodx: i think at least
[6:03:24] willie_stroker_99: Feral is shit now, but I used to lo e it
[6:03:27] zachgamegodx: from observing good ferals
[6:03:34] repsac1442: @axtin do you ever stream brother?

[6:20:15] FateIRL: do you really think pikaboo needs that 2 grand to kick someone? makes no sense
[6:20:23] Cocoapuffs1: jelly specifically told ppl not to do that
[6:20:26] TheMercDeadpool: Jellybeans said not to harass them
