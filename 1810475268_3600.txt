[5:13:32] murk__lurk: trios seems a bit too easy for HC in my opinion
[5:13:36] massivewow: @lostnight512 its a pve server and max level is 60
[5:13:39] tatershotss: 3 people coordinating HC is challenging
[5:13:41] Numtjok: @lostnight512 PVP is opt in.
[5:13:50] Atomikus88: I think the "being online at the same time" restriction might be a problem later on, especially for 3 people and IRL stuff
[5:13:57] bubbapog: hes been here forever
[5:13:58] HalfaXan: @lostnight512 hc is played on rp server
[5:14:00] WanderNChill: @Vaelthryn Ye i'd agree it's slow and grueling enough to really make you feel the weight of the deaths xd
[5:14:18] blackscoute: what is he playing for a class?? chat
[5:14:18] Fossabot: @blackscoute He's playing World of Warcraft
[5:14:23] zixxxs: shrouds a mythic raider
[5:14:23] Numtjok: @lostnight512 If someone kills you in a way that could be considered griefing, the death doesnt count
[5:14:39] blackscoute: ok
[5:14:43] Vaelthryn: @WanderNChill i felt bad about a 10 and a 12 but now that i have a 30 im just taking my time
[5:15:01] Iratic: classic pumper
[5:15:12] Erktraz: I mean you got CE last season bro I'd say you're a mythic raider ;O
[5:15:17] The_Faceless_Void: I mean you did grind mythic kills kinda well
[5:15:18] bodeyyy: Shroud what was your highest rating in arena back in Bc days ?

[5:15:43] The_Faceless_Void: @terpfeinnnn 15 dollar sub to play
[5:15:44] darkc0iL: classic is dumb-proof LULW
[5:15:46] Numtjok: @terpfeinnnn No. You have to buy the base game and pay a monthly fee
[5:15:49] Ali_Toddo: Yo which halo is this ?

[5:16:02] Strikezilla01: WoW is better when it's chill and fun. Once you take it too serious or in depth, it tends to lose flavor.

[5:16:59] darkc0iL: @terpfeinnnn this is the way
[5:17:10] terpfeinnnn: This is the way
[5:17:11] Tuuba: Only retail requires you to buy the latest expansion (a.k.a. the base game)
[5:17:24] The_Faceless_Void: @malkath well most ppl are waiting for next tuesday for M+ and raid so it makes sense HC is kinda poppin off
[5:17:24] Shiftyloid: sheeesh

[5:25:06] davien12: @xCadranx ty
[5:25:08] deadvesu: there are achievements that will push you to take more risks @shroud ( just tuned in so not sure if mentioned )

[5:26:12] Bierce_IV: on paper its easy, actually grinding it out, gets hard
[5:26:15] Strikezilla01: The only "issue" with killing green mobs would be finding ones which pair with your level efficiently. Mobs can range from 2-3 levels different.
[5:26:15] Numtjok: @thenewguy176 They all lose the challenge
[5:26:16] thenewguy176: F
[5:26:24] WanderNChill: How does one kill which has no life?
[5:26:26] mengfish: honestly grinding doesn't feel that bad when you can't trade, since you can be grinding mobs while collecting cloth or skins etc

[5:26:41] Atomikus88: grinding is just a time investment and not necessary = skill
[5:26:44] Kynlee23: hey shroud you should try a HC character in first person if you die. I did it and got to 19, got greedy with caster mobs. pretty fun though. makes it a lot more intense
[5:26:46] codevenomsnakes: Does Shroud use any addon for world of warcraft?
[5:26:51] cjchua02: @cjchua02 Just asking because Shroud is the king of FPS game. Everytime I see new fps game he always play the game. Specially with big platform.
[5:26:54] Aesoth: play orc shaman?
[5:27:02] soupbase: durotar so crowded anyway

[5:27:06] Numtjok: @codevenomsnakes A couple.
[5:27:08] tinksc: @shroud you have to pick the same starter zone for HC duos and trios
[5:27:11] Lambstew: xqcY

[5:27:36] Insane1medic: What level are we @shroud
[5:27:37] cosmicoriginz: you don't
[5:27:37] Notsolegendary: Troll shaman great for caster
[5:27:40] codevenomsnakes: @Numtjok Ok what are they. What addon does he use?
[5:27:42] Krajn: no but you must be lvl 1
[5:27:42] rubby_ducker: troll / orc are the same starting zone, and are arguably the best for any class. troll regen is SUPER useful
[5:27:43] joewoess: you have to run over before level 2 afaik
[5:27:44] xCadranx: @tinksc you dont have to, you just have to be able to party up before level 2
[5:27:45] JohnJustGaming: You can pick diff zones you just all have to be level 1
[5:27:47] gabbbana: you have to be in the ame zome before dinging 2
[5:27:47] OatmanTV: u cant be lvl 2 tho i think
[5:27:48] cosmicoriginz: he's right chat you can run over
[5:27:50] HOCKARMEN: its fine if you dont lvl up before them
[5:27:50] phar0z: just do it before lvl 2
[5:27:50] Axells_Abode: u cant be over lvl 2 or something
[5:27:50] pkprell: Think they said you  have to meet up within 10 minutes as well not hit level 2 before you meet
[5:27:52] xzxProofxzx: Read the rules, says u both have to spawn in the same zone.
[5:27:58] system_out: @shroud u pref healing ?
[5:28:03] tinksc: @shroud maybe I misread. At the bottom of the rules page on the add-on it says something about it. Maybe I misunderstood
[5:28:04] shame_sz: running around thunderbluff on HC sounds fun
[5:28:06] AaronRespect: NO you can run over just dont level past 1
[5:28:06] Kynlee23: @xzxProofxzx no it doesnt lol
[5:28:11] tummboi: @xzxProofxzx nope
[5:28:16] Atomikus88: nope
[5:28:18] ares710: you just need to stay in the same zone together it doesnt matter if you guys pick different races
[5:28:19] Lambstew: @shroud thoughts on the price of WoW membership? could it be lowered or is it worth it?
[5:28:27] Angermund: @xzxProofxzx maybe read the full sentence
[5:28:32] Numtjok: @codevenomsnakes I don't know them all. The important ones are "questie", "restedexp", "hardcore".

[5:28:40] Lambstew: @WackaNerd what
[5:28:50] OatmanTV: exploration is monkaS
[5:28:53] Delthiri: depends, but yes
[5:28:54] plebinatar: get skadoo to meet u halfway then
[5:28:56] Criticalsnap: not if you stay on the road
[5:28:58] JohnJustGaming: You just stay on the roads and then you wont discover much
[5:29:00] Criticalsnap: you won't
[5:29:04] cs_chance: stay on the road and you don't explore
[5:29:09] tinksc: Oh my add-on doesn't say that included part of "or find a way to meet in the middle pre 2. Sorry guys!
[5:29:10] UuuhThisGuy: Most people swim to avoid
[5:29:11] OatmanTV: like whisper is the smart choice

[5:31:08] Axells_Abode: but doesnt partying up defeat the point of the HC? like ur not going to die if u group up?
[5:31:09] thelich1king: wow is so much more with the music
[5:31:12] synthex_ttv: Codex lite much better than questie!
[5:31:24] tinksc: @axells_abode if even one person dies the whole group fails
[5:31:27] hate_xyz: maybe he needs to turn auto tracking on and off again, because that's what happened to me
[5:31:33] Numtjok: @Axells_Abode You can still die. It is easier though.
[5:31:39] codevenomsnakes: @brewess Ok then why they have RTX just for Shadows and not the whole game.
[5:31:55] ixpha: been so many years since i played wow, but dont the quest xpreward  become crap at green/grey?
[5:31:57] Tuuba: @Axells_Abode well yeah you're certainly less likely to die, but if 1 dies you both get disqualified, also you *have* to play together. you can't solo when the other person is sleeping

[6:40:19] jobetss: no
[6:40:19] Pinsvin1010: no
[6:40:23] massivewow: @shroud need blacksmithing for enchanting
[6:40:23] Pinsvin1010: You need blacksmith for rods
[6:40:24] AbendrothYolo: oh damn, died at 38, rip

[6:40:24] vision42g: no
[6:40:28] lizardboiy: you should have 1 alch and 2 engi

[6:40:29] Numtjok: One of you need blacksmithing
[6:40:30] shmorgyborgy: enchanting is only good early, someone has to go bs if u enchanting
[6:40:34] Royal_Mail: Need a blacksmith if enchanting
[6:40:34] KontrolStyle: LUL
[6:40:36] maro_haro: enchanting is bad because you need mining for rods !
[6:40:41] Nexnation: @ZeroXides no you need enchanting to make the wand. You just drop it after
[6:40:42] plebinatar: shroud do skinning till 15 then drop it
[6:40:43] maro_haro: *BS
[6:40:47] LordTharon: Where would you be getting money, the vendor? lol
[6:40:48] BubbaBahiba: @shroud  mining blaksmith (can mane enchanting rod) / Taylor enchanting / alch herb

[6:40:52] Iolumadbro: the skinning vendors for a lot?
[6:40:52] rubby_ducker: as a priest you go enchanting ONLY until he can craft himself a wand, then drop it for something else

[6:41:04] drunkinthemornin: what the general chat
[6:41:07] mr_scorpion17: you gonna play the system test in valorant today ?
[6:41:10] Nexnation: @ZeroXides it is massively worth it
[6:41:12] notclariity: devs were mostly horde players. clear horde bias in classic
[6:41:15] Quirup: Leatherworking/Skinning----- Mining/Blacksmith----- Tailoring Enchanting?
[6:41:19] vision42g: alc herb min engi ll be enough
[6:41:19] Numtjok: BS would be fine if rogue was a warrior instead
[6:41:20] bombassa89: @Nexnation which wand?
[6:41:22] Nexnation: @ZeroXides priests are pretty much wand bots
[6:41:33] alakazam__man: Hc wow makes me want to actually play wow
[6:41:39] depressdmonke: is he playing classic or wotk or what version?
[6:41:39] syukaan1: @Quirup no one in group wears plate for later blacksmithing
[6:41:39] Pinsvin1010: First 2 wands are doable without having blacksmith
[6:41:44] Pinsvin1010: But after that it's 100% req
[6:41:53] ZeroXides: @nexnation For horde it matters minimal even wand spec priest there’s one just as decent
[6:41:58] maxakicsgo: Jespar without the q?
[6:41:59] flirtle: enchanting is very hard
[6:42:05] mengfish: let him get his wands with enchanting then drop for skinning after
[6:42:07] Pokrog: enchanting is so damn expensive
[6:42:09] Iolumadbro: where does the money come from @shroud

[6:44:41] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[6:44:42] Nexnation: @ZeroXides just going to hard disagree with thinking wand is minimal. Its a large portion of their damage since it requires no mana
[6:44:47] Mattafox: Any clip the skip?
[6:44:48] depressdmonke: would you guys recommend buying wow to play classic again or are the servers too dead

[6:46:26] Rezort_: @jazzoo01 you die you delete your character
[6:46:26] depressdmonke: wait*
[6:46:28] Nexnation: @ZeroXides the next wand that is as good as greater magic wand is one thats a level 25 quest
[6:46:33] KAVE_M4N: What's your squad catchphrase? @shroud

[6:56:08] Savath: Yo shroud, talk to your mods man.  They put me in a 2 1/2 hour chat time out because I responded to you saying that you spent $100 on Redfall and how that was a joke.  The message they said to me was "Go hate on the game somewhere else".  Reading the chat as you were playing was wayyy worse.  Super disappointed in your mods.
[6:56:08] massivewow: @ZenKorhan every healer has a dps spec
[6:56:10] gulk_: Barkskin is dudu

[9:21:55] Oshkala: @dankydiaper if you're doing a HC run bloodsail buccaneers is where
[9:22:01] ZeroXides: @kenti_i It’s still not super easy by any means without farming even with 3 gotta hope enough cloth drops which most of the time it doesn’t hence the need to farm it because you normally only get about 6 to 8 quests a zone with humanoids to even drop it
[9:22:05] JerseyBricklayer: i have had people from here msg me with threats in the past just because i laughed at them getting banned. LUL

[9:23:03] Kenti_i: @zeroxides mmkay, but from my own experience lvling «thousands  of times» its not an issue, u basicly dont need to farm much if u just go to the right zones while lvling

[10:01:56] Mahca_: i heard its safer to raid ally since they have pallys
[10:01:56] TheMuscularWeeb: @shroud is WOW a game worth getting into?
[10:01:58] haackster: jst lvl

[10:02:10] billgarr1: they are good for AOE
[10:02:10] mattlokk: google "classic wow engineering guide"
[10:02:11] Tatarek: the guide is to make rough copper bombs
[10:02:11] Synthez542: Bolts
[10:02:12] rickyxb0bbyx: use the mats ytou have make as much as you can till the wording changes color
[10:02:16] hollaHK: make like 20 bombs, they're super worth

[10:02:25] Nosni_tv: a little bit idk xD
[10:02:25] hollaHK: the guide is overrated and aimed at powerlevelling profs
[10:02:26] Recknry: you're gonna need more for target dummies too
[10:02:27] rickyxb0bbyx: if it turns yellow stop
[10:02:30] Synthez542: Bolts then bombs at green
[10:02:33] babygirlhc1: 20 or so bolts
[10:02:33] cunningstunt61: guides arent made for HC
[10:02:33] Leisure_Suit_Larry: I don't fit into hidden hills
[10:02:38] xeap: guides use the auction house, completely worthless here
[10:02:38] vailecule2: u and ur whole team has to farm if that happens KEKW
[10:02:43] SpaceVoyage: restedxp should have profession guides right?
[10:02:44] Roninjoker: Down side of making too many bombs is outleveling them if you powerlevel your crafting
[10:02:47] DrCrusherOohLaLa: guides = just buy mats 4Head

[10:02:55] greatscythe: guides assume you can use the auction house
[10:02:55] Chicken_vegetas: youll need the bolts later, and they are good for leveling
[10:02:57] Nosni_tv: idk if thats true, there's usually one best option to make .. guides leverage cheap shit
[10:03:02] thewhitepoggers: @shroud I know this isn't relevant to the game RN but are you excited for the new class in ESO?

[10:03:32] mattlokk: you don't need to follow a guide to the letter, but it will tell you things like "you need x item later to make y" or it can tell you which item uses the fewest resources
[10:03:44] Cribbler: @shroud u need copper to make a lot of bronze bars later on
[10:03:49] Grovypants: go train
[10:03:56] beastlyhoods: Why doesnt ska stream? he gets hella views he would make a good living off of it

[10:35:33] brick56: you can use the default and turn on raid frames so you can move it
[10:35:33] RunicTitan: IMO
[10:35:34] Spiderbite3330: SUF is good if you customize it, remove the portraits, make the power bars smaller, add a clean look etc
[10:35:40] Eh_Sosa: you can make Suf if u spen sometime on it, thats what i did it looks clean
[10:35:40] haackster: noobie killer cave lol

[10:36:30] Gelligan: rare
[10:36:33] IAmLiebee: My man is playing wow in 2008 with that UI

[10:37:08] FunkDatShiz: @Roninjoker nice!
[10:37:17] tatershotss: slow HC leveling
[10:37:55] Protomateria: thats cause retail actually takes skill lol
[10:37:58] ThatIsSoCrazy: i parsed 98 on 1 fight my first season ever playing retail
[10:38:05] spokenfigure: the pie weights of calm
[10:38:23] mengfish: if you play a spec like aff or udk it can be more difficult in wotlk i think
[10:38:26] gindua: @shroud shroud you can move the party frames by default just click on the arrow on the left and then on unlock you can even make it look better than that addon per default xD just turn on raid frames as party frames in the setting

[10:39:20] spokenfigure: this game has class
[10:39:20] oprawindfurytv: yea you destroy me on dps in the GDKPs but i really dont know how to parse a 99. im 90 parse andy
[10:39:24] DongsAreVeryExciting: if your guilds good its easy to 99, if you're in a dad guild not so much because kill times are low
[10:39:26] Laeini: HC Trio
[10:39:33] j0shst3r: I don't think he plays Feral so he can say those things
[10:39:35] mengfish: well not hard compared to mythic 99s, agreed
[10:39:38] Leisure_Suit_Larry: Being a photo double will give the opportunity to make countess babies
[10:39:47] osoi____: @nodiggityx he just said ur not a gamer KEKW
[10:39:52] chronictaco: I thought you couldnt trade till 60?
[10:39:58] mengfish: but definitely harder than retail heroic in my experience
[10:39:59] nodiggityx: Unlucky
[10:40:03] Omni35: Playing ret and saying 99s are easy makes my brain melt
[10:40:16] Gelligan: @chronictaco you can trade with each other in duo/trio
[10:40:23] nickrotic: @chronictaco they're group leveling, they can trade with each other, but if one dies they all die
[10:40:23] Laeini: Are you Resto?
[10:40:25] Omni35: You can get a 95 with a 1 button macro
[10:40:25] chronictaco: ah ty
[10:40:29] gatorade_ch: Hey @shroud what happened to the G303 badges? Was it something feasible or not possible just yet?
[10:40:42] ClassicAndy1: he doesn't understand how parsing works lol
[10:40:43] Omni35: I disagree
[10:40:44] osoi____: own these classic frauds shroud KEKW

[10:40:47] nodiggityx: Suure
[10:40:48] ClassicAndy1: and hes also in a really good guild probably
[10:40:48] bbarrell: Arent parses just relative to the other players? Why would it change from classis to retail?
[10:40:51] Steakslive: go 99 parse on a aff lock rofl
[10:40:52] Roninjoker: Allow people to pay to mod your UI - everyone can be happy.
[10:40:58] duskerzx: whats shrouds level right now?
[10:41:01] ThatIsSoCrazy: if quite litterally everyone can parse 99 then its no longer a 99 its a 50 cuz thats the AVERAGE
[10:41:03] Gelligan: 11
[10:41:05] ClassicAndy1: @bbarrell thats right, hes missing that, and is just in a good guild with good kill times
[10:41:11] duskerzx: thanks
[10:41:16] MaffelMoffel: @shroud you can do childrens week quest for 5g
[10:41:17] mengfish: all top guilds running 5-6+ aff locks means 99s on aff lock are definitely more difficult
[10:41:18] Decimation7: Is this classic ?
