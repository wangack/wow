[2:58:10] jajajamuu: pog
[2:58:14] Morthanos: if you have furor talent you can shift bear and that puts you in combat for a few sec to put up the flag and not get sapped
[2:58:30] HydraPaladin: why they changing 1 to 0 to 1
[2:58:33] TheChaboi: @flippstarx3 because not every class has 10 million movement abilities that allows them to fly around

[2:58:51] Sockfullapoo: why is every team alliance?
[2:59:05] Soniti: You have to rely on the duration cause you can't pick up flag in form
[2:59:11] ChillyHTX: making his way downtown, walking fast
[2:59:15] WeebTrap: medge is a girl! LuvHearts
[2:59:23] HermiteCrab: @Sockfullapoo probly because dwarf priest exists LUL
[2:59:24] Morthanos: @Norzion_ but they can be sapped in human for and they need to be in human form to pick up flag
[2:59:25] et007: god its been so long i forgot that sap didnt work on druids, but hibernate does
[2:59:27] Axadeos: is it 0-0 or 0-1

[2:59:45] ZPUTTAN: @weebtrap Who asked? shut it
[2:59:45] HydraPaladin: 0-0 in paralle universe
[2:59:52] Sockfullapoo: i dont play classic so im surprised alliance is the pvp faction
[2:59:56] hypnoidal: BLIZZARD FIX YOUR SCOREBOARDS
[3:00:04] Norzion_: alliance has better racial for bgs/team fights
[3:00:08] cruzifax: @Warcraft You should try to add a minimap
[3:00:08] stsk1290: can we get the Chinese production team next time?
[3:00:12] guildmage: Freedom / Fear Ward
[3:00:15] jajajamuu: lets go
[3:00:15] R3v_: @Sockfullapoo It's not, last match was horde vs horde
[3:00:26] Soniti: Horde racials are better 1v1 but the existance of paladin makes alliance strong in group pvp
[3:00:26] Moobot: Follow the stream by clicking on the heart in the upper right corner of the player to be notified when we go live!
[3:00:30] funkypot: its not racials its paladins vs shamans

[3:00:57] Copenhagenxx: @hydrapaladin facts
[3:01:16] guildmage: Really the only truly imbalanced factor is Flash Bomb. Not having Fear Ward advantage is just playing without a crucial immunity to the best way to catch the enemy FC.
[3:01:23] Morthanos: also gnome racial is very good
[3:01:28] et007: dwarfs and their dumb freaking fear ward
[3:01:28] Lowkn: they need to make 6v6 RBGS on retail so much potential
[3:01:39] garvilo9: Flash bombs should be removed from the game
[3:02:00] et007: gnome racial was only good for wsg, other than that humans and ne were better
[3:02:02] Soniti: That is true re: fear ward due to flash bomb
[3:02:04] MixoooW: engeener vs engeener thats all
[3:02:06] jajajamuu: leets goo

[3:03:26] Moobot: Follow the stream by clicking on the heart in the upper right corner of the player to be notified when we go live!
[3:03:29] sweaty_irl: cameraman should be fired after this
[3:03:51] Hirov51: RUN RUN
[3:03:57] stsk1290: higher stealth lvl is the weakest rogue racial
[3:03:58] guildmage: The Chinese Camera positioning was professional grade... What happened to that quality?
[3:04:02] NateTheScot: ResidentSleeper
[3:04:03] Soniti: Give them some slack this is the first wsg tourney in classic
