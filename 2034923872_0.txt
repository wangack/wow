[1:11:43] AceOfFlame: For me, they should just remove the rep gain from party queing..if that kills premades then so be it because they didnt group up to premade but just for selfish needs
[1:11:52] charlesrrr: if they dont allow pre mades, then people will complain about their bad random comps

[1:43:16] redcrimtane: play the knife ear one

[1:43:30] JimBobJr: the worst thing is you invent work for people in the form of new projects that then need to be maintained over time so you end up hiring even more people KEKL

[1:48:16] chaos_terrain: can this guy go 5 seconds without mentioning that he's a CEO
[1:48:30] mac_y2k: hes giving me spergtard patrick bateman vibes
[1:48:30] ohg33: Tesla has done it in response to huge recalls, coupled with a downturn in sales
[1:48:51] blueboywiz: true. lot of devs are coasting
[1:49:10] iBanEvader: @chaos_terrain he's a CEO so he knows all the finances and motives of all companies
[1:49:14] blueboywiz: there ppl who make 300k a year coasting. its fuking sad parasites in this industry
[1:49:22] iBanEvader: @chaos_terrain Kappa

[1:49:53] JimBobJr: usually management is so out of touch with what is actually going on day to day by this point when they do layoffs its done mostly at random (in my experience)

[1:50:52] Bare02: yeah :(
[1:51:00] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV UI changes for example :p
[1:51:03] ohg33: It is a saturated labor pool though, too much competition and many will take a lower salary to perform the same "remedial" job skills
[1:51:15] levesconte: im a millennial but i grew up in a small town working on farms. so no when i moved to the city the first thing i realized was is how fukin lazy my generation is and how much worse its getting with new generations
[1:51:17] IR_ish: yea i guess, that's why i don't have colleagues
[1:51:26] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV there's no real planned obsolescene for developers
[1:51:31] blueboywiz: thats because people who genuinely wanted to push the company forward started retiring. those roles became filled with outside experience and boom it becomes a top-down problem that trickles down. Reagonomics brother KKona
[1:51:38] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV it's a selfsabotaging job
[1:51:39] Mightyhal: DEI sucked the Mert based leadership out of todays workforce
[1:52:17] ohg33: You can outsource a huge amount of the work involved in dev based projects. So, you need principal skilled stake holders and the rest can me done for cents on the $
[1:52:21] SpaceGhost8: i think thats what it will become, discount on sub
[1:52:23] baptyzmbyf1re: @Mightyhal so weird... 91% of C levels hired in 2023 were non-white, non-males.  i'm sure it was PURELY on merit ;)
[1:52:23] Snaketrap: the POGMILFKERS streamers will keep twitch profitable YEP

[1:55:25] iBanEvader: kinda true
[1:55:25] Bare02: at the very minimum its advertisement for it
[1:55:30] JimBobJr: if there's a pipeline its using twitch prime and deciding you like being subbed and then paying for subs
[1:55:30] seksmuhchine: no bricks
[1:55:34] avox_o7: agreed, it's the 'oh, i already have it"
[1:55:35] LyonNate23: now they're using twitch and more likely to subb to others
[1:55:35] SpoolyZ02: SpoolyZ02 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:55:43] PazokiTV: people use prime for free shipping mostly and the streaming service, not twitch LUL
[1:55:44] Humansoup: o7
[1:55:45] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Ive never evem bought anything on amazon
[1:55:49] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV 5Head  I didn't think that far
[1:55:54] TyrDraco: following word for word YEP
[1:55:57] thatquidproquo: sstvLOVE
[1:56:01] 1Horsepower: It helps retention for those users - Prime has millions of subs, every fraction of a percent they retain is a large number
[1:56:04] cjadude: sstvWAT
[1:56:06] S_Aljallaf: GAAYMERS!! Hello
[1:56:07] Piorum_: a sub costs them nothing, I don't think people who prime would pay if they didn't have, if anything it may make them more likely to pay by integrating them into twitch more
[1:56:11] caremeter: I think the whole prime lost leader business model is to gather your chat logs and have it linked directly to a known/confirmed account like Amazon.
[1:56:39] caremeter: Doesnt make sense to lose money like that but tech companies always do that shit to gather data.
[1:56:41] SpaceGhost8: @caremeter thats how I've understood it, too
[1:56:51] Snaketrap: monkaSpin
[1:56:58] Daximus_: CEO translator KEKL
[1:57:00] xelm_: its always beating around the bush until the very second.
[1:57:01] AceOfFlame: the PR is insane KEKW
[1:57:03] Bare02: is there a way to see what % of your subs are prime? @StaysafeTV
[1:57:04] iBanEvader: @caremeter yea it's 100% used for personal data selling for ads
[1:57:05] Humansoup: lol True
[1:57:14] Snaketrap: ICANT
[1:57:17] Polerize: take a hell of a hit if they do get rid of it
[1:57:17] Weeaboo__Chad: Blizzard waited waaaay too long for the next sod phase. The hype wave is dead af
[1:57:18] 1Horsepower: Pog Clap
[1:57:19] DeltaBased: prime token
[1:57:25] Snaketrap: YEP or they give you more ads
[1:57:31] DemonicAvatar: i doubt Amazon likes Twitch Prime
[1:57:37] seksmuhchine: i dont take a cut never
[1:57:40] Weeaboo__Chad: Probably not
[1:57:55] timothyx000: YouTube streaming is waaay better
[1:58:11] Weeaboo__Chad: Does twitch not like Turbo either? They hardly advertise it
[1:58:14] ohg33: With the ad revenue and subs, I can't believe it is even an issue...
[1:58:32] DemonicAvatar: @timothyx000 it isnt but YT has more people who could be possible viewer but the stream experience is worse
[1:58:45] SpaceGhost8: idk, I have a giant "Get Ad-Free" button on the top right
[1:58:45] levesconte: levesconte gifted a Tier 1 sub to agenis!

[2:00:07] DemonicAvatar: @DeltaBased germany
[2:00:08] frootpunchxd: twitch streamers are carpet baggers, they need to pay twitch for all the data they use, and leave Prime system intact...
[2:00:12] ohg33: Bezos is a greedy fuck!!!
[2:00:16] SpaceGhost8: YEP discount on subs
[2:00:20] DeltaBased: @DemonicAvatar oh

[2:00:57] SpaceGhost8: yeah but how are costs allocated
[2:01:03] frootpunchxd: but we can't get a free sub... because we just cost too much money, the poors...
[2:01:04] Snaketrap: pepeLaugh 240p limit for 2 viewer andys
[2:01:06] cerealkillas22: Asmon prob causes them to lose so much money since  he doesnt stream on his main channel
[2:01:16] dirbagdan: maybe amazon doesnt care and they just use it as an ad platform and gain revenue in other ways
[2:01:17] frootpunchxd: The welfare state weighing twitch down...
[2:01:28] DemonicAvatar: @Snaketrap with AV1 it would even be watchable
[2:01:28] frootpunchxd: monkaHmm
[2:01:38] Subjugation: I remember when they gave Logic a contract lol
[2:01:44] caremeter: @StaysafeTV What is the best way to support you?  Your my only sub.  Is it better to do tier 1 or 3 or what?  What model steals the most from the initial amount for Amazon?
[2:01:44] ohg33: "Product" The creators are the product
[2:01:45] mac_y2k: i hate this dude
[2:01:46] Lionkingler1: it makes perfect sense to buy talent for your website
[2:01:46] fastest2synapses: aws being such a high cost for them when its your own parent company must be nice
[2:01:57] iBanEvader: @cerealkillas22 asmon advertises a lot for twitch indirectly
[2:02:02] frootpunchxd: Isn't it heavy the burden of all the prime subs...
[2:02:17] frootpunchxd: doesn't it weigh so heavy.... prime subs.... on all this companies talent
[2:02:18] iBanEvader: @cerealkillas22 people who find his youtube channel and then flock to twitch
[2:02:19] harvenius: @fastest2synapses makes me wonder if they calculate this loss at full retail AWS prices for their services
[2:02:26] Snaketrap: pepeLaugh
[2:02:32] DemonicAvatar: @frootpunchxd amazon loves when people forget their twitch prime

[2:08:26] DeltaBased: what is rumble for?
[2:08:27] frootpunchxd: Less European white washed influence... so it's better by default

[2:08:48] DeltaBased: nice
[2:08:55] abdarahyin: TV lasted like half a century... it changed ONLY because of technology change with the internet. No matter the medium, we like broadcast channels. What could replace streaming until technology changes? Twitch is here as long as current regular internet patterns remain the same on 2nd screen gamer andys and dedicated fans on phones.
[2:09:02] blueboywiz: mixer could have saved us all

[2:50:41] NutterCircus: Hosed the market
[2:50:44] kingdulli: battle pass when
[2:50:45] Daximus_: just more raw gold pumped into the economy and incentives to do quests u should save
[2:50:53] razorvision4: just speeds up inflation
[2:50:59] NotDessx: It's a good meaningful choice If it hurts you next phase leveling
[2:51:04] XarcTV: yea hopefully they change it for 40 and 50

[2:51:26] MONNlBLAST: @NotDessx literally no need for quests
[2:51:31] NutterCircus: Has anyone tried to do the 5 man of BFD?
[2:51:35] AceOfFlame: who the hell will actually be questing KEKW people just be spamming to 40
[2:51:37] KShellZx: people are just going to have so much extra gold that won't need
[2:51:42] AceOfFlame: with dungeons
[2:51:44] Lionkingler1: farming that gold at 40 will take more time than the 2 hours of dungeon grinding to get the exp
[2:51:57] saund: Heaps of you go skinning in atv
[2:51:58] NutterCircus: BFD used to be a 5 man.
[2:51:58] sighwarlock: every char i make i just hope for a sick boe to drop for gold tbh
[2:52:00] saund: Stv
[2:52:11] greenbeartelevision: you make about 100-120 if u do 1-25

[2:53:04] greenbeartelevision: If u do all the quests
[2:53:09] greenbeartelevision: I have 350g
[2:53:10] AceOfFlame: no you make about 100-120g by being at lvl 25 and doing relevant quests for gold
[2:53:11] hrokk: its crazy blizzard needs to lock it so people dont go degen
[2:53:13] greenbeartelevision: 3 characters
[2:53:14] Lionkingler1: engi meta will be nuts at 40
[2:53:31] AilosDK: But that aint from doing quests from 1-25. thats doing the quests at 25.
[2:53:33] Sendoken: This kinda screws druids, because of the helm
[2:53:35] saund: It got farmed so much that on living flame Hibbert went to 20g
[2:53:40] therealrickdiculous: busted
[2:53:47] dirbagdan: +tauren
[2:53:48] AilosDK: you aint got 350g just from lvling while spending ALL the gold u make for skills.

[2:55:05] AilosDK: @greenbeartelevision Ofc, that means you do like 90% of the quests at lvl 25. where they all give 1g +++ .
[2:55:07] plantbaseddav1d: Can't wait to kite Teremus to SW in phase 2
[2:55:43] OspreyRed: Tauren OP
[2:55:43] hrokk: @plantbaseddav1d didnt they disable that?
[2:55:47] Noilane: ghosties Kreygasm
[2:55:51] greenbeartelevision: @AilosDK Yes that exactly how u do it
[2:55:55] dirbagdan: 255 there are +5 gloves and then you can +5 enchant them now cant you?
[2:55:56] dormdotz: cant wait for taurens to cry when gnomes can one shot them with gnomish death ray
[2:56:05] plantbaseddav1d: @hrokk I think that is just for hardcore griefing
[2:56:11] greenbeartelevision: @AilosDK Im not lying. Its around 100-120g if u do that way
[2:56:11] iBanEvader: @dirbagdan +3
[2:56:18] dirbagdan: @iBanEvader ahhh right
[2:56:20] AilosDK: @greenbeartelevision Yeah but you said u made 100-125g leveling 1-25 . which isnt true then :p You get 100-120g AFTER dinging 25.
[2:56:46] greenbeartelevision: @AilosDK If u scroll up i did say after do all quests
[2:56:50] Lionkingler1: yeah warrior / rogue / wl getting fucked
[2:56:50] saund: They'll remove it like in udpuar 100%

[2:57:03] MC_WhiteNoiz: I'm a rogue, and I don't like the elemental boss
[2:57:08] hrokk: @Lionkingler1 why?
[2:57:11] XarcTV: rogue gonna have to main backstab
[2:57:21] AilosDK: @greenbeartelevision greenbeartelevision: you make about 100-120 if u do 1-25 was your first statement. ;)
[2:57:29] therealrickdiculous: the secret rogue warrior pve nerf is gnomer mechs
[2:57:32] SmokeyZugs: I heal so sstvKING
[2:57:34] Lionkingler1: @hrokk bleed poison immunity in gnomer
[2:57:39] greenbeartelevision: @AilosDK np
[2:57:40] AceOfFlame: 1h sword rogue is gonna be meh next phase 100%
[2:57:40] thebridgeler: just make new wep consumes like the oils / sharpstones that bypass the mech immunes
[2:57:44] SlapaH03: maybe the bosses are humanoid

[2:58:22] cthulhufthagn19: there is a quest that needs true silver that gives a decent aoe trinket
[2:58:25] Mohrton: omfg
[2:58:26] NutterCircus: This is why SOD is soo good, you get to realy get to know classic leveling again.
[2:58:36] ozmondprince: gnome hype!
[2:58:39] pkprell: @StaysafeTV The worst part about the Herbalist gloves, the recipe is Alliance only PepeHands
[2:58:59] Lionkingler1: they have to remove battle chicken from logs
[2:59:06] jojenhorse: would be unfortunate if horde do not get something to balance that out
[2:59:31] iBanEvader: damn that's crazy lol
[2:59:38] iBanEvader: finally some use for neutral ah
[2:59:50] Bobka: Sappers POG
[2:59:52] Lionkingler1: that will be nasty
[2:59:54] Bobka: BIG DAM
[2:59:58] Mohrton: sapper charge and death ray gonna make gnome rogues so good
[3:00:01] NutterCircus: Mage lvl 40 will be godlike.
[3:00:03] dirbagdan: @jojenhorse horde can get the same engineering stuff as alliance. Just depends on gnome or goblin spec
[3:00:15] sighwarlock: LFM GNomers MUST HAVE SAPPERS
[3:00:17] Lionkingler1: YEP pull half the instance and pop sapper
[3:00:18] RodanQQ: its going to be glorious
[3:00:21] Sal_con: its gonmna be sweaty
[3:00:23] saund: I won't be sapping at all fuck parsing
[3:00:40] jojenhorse: no, its the crafting of the sniper scope and the death ray that will only be available to gnome engineers (according to that yt video)?
[3:00:42] StueartTV: im ready for phase 2
[3:00:49] linkitcraig: oh god, gnomer speedruns with sappers
[3:00:52] leroylol: big black mace

[3:01:14] MC_WhiteNoiz: People actually playing the GAME I love it
[3:01:16] mbbexcel: I need me a BBM
[3:01:21] pkprell: No Shapeshift head PepeHands
[3:01:27] iBanEvader: also like how people farming rare mobs etc. for prebis
[3:01:30] SmokeyZugs: So should Classic+ roll out in phases like this?
[3:01:35] sighwarlock: damnnn
[3:01:50] hrokk: @MC_WhiteNoiz you mean people use restedxp and using all guides in the universe Kappa
[3:01:55] iBanEvader: @SmokeyZugs this kinda is classic+ already
[3:01:57] Mawshaw: Alch gets kind of shafted with the 225 cap, there's like 5+ potions/elixir that req over  225 but level req under 40
[3:02:15] sighwarlock: i hope the new raids world buffs drop in a different city again
[3:02:17] SmokeyZugs: @iBanEvader It is but it is seasonal and not permanent enough to really be
[3:02:24] Mind_G0bl1n: @SmokeyZugs phases gives blizzard a way to get multiple feedback cycles on specs and meta in preparation for classic+ Prayge
[3:02:26] Lionkingler1: they should add +5 skill loot in gnomer
[3:02:49] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV I've all mats
[3:02:56] QuestFor420: yeah buy my bronze bars
[3:03:01] MC_WhiteNoiz: @hrokk y'know, that used to bother me. But I realized I play solo and pvp so it really doesn't impact me. I have an in with a GDKP group so I was able to accrue a little bit of gold to afford the inflation
[3:03:14] TogaTig: ;)
[3:03:27] NutterCircus: Every Two months of fighting for mob tags will get old fast.
[3:03:33] iBanEvader: very good video
