[4:58:33] Norcore: wasn't that a store
[4:58:34] thorzain22: Flying with a hernia has a couple of risks. The first of these is that there is a small chance that the changes in air pressure in the cabin could cause the hernia to strangulate which would require immediate medical attention that is not possible whilst on a plane.
[4:58:35] Rashavik: KEKG

[5:00:58] thorzain22: Phynaes ¬∑ 1 yr. ago I flew across the Atlantic with bilateral inguinal hernias about the same size as yours, with no problems. I wore my hernia truss, made sure it wasn't too tight or too loose, and made sure:  a) that when I was seated, I was as relaxed and stretched out as possible so nothing would be under strain or condensed, and  b) that I got up and moved around regularly to keep the blood flowing.
