[1:02:40] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:02:44] NPBeharry: the issue with sub is being invincible
[1:03:09] Solastro: sub needs to have to choose between triple DR stunning someone and doing their full damage rotation
[1:03:09] taylorperiod: does it feel as bad in organized 3s though? its of course horrible in shuffle because no comms and random coms
[1:03:11] Cybernytez: its only 10 % more and healers only get 5 % more

[1:03:54] ghostgalx: ownd
[1:03:54] W00dyyx: Ven was saying was probably due to the holy paly armor getting nerfed
[1:03:57] Solastro: buT YoU gEt a ShIeLd
[1:04:00] W00dyyx: didnt want shaman have more armor than pally
[1:04:09] Cybernytez: most of the changes dont make sense to me tbh KEKW
[1:04:12] ifreed33: i think armor changes are an experiment to see how much armor really matters Lol
[1:04:17] What_ln_Tarnation: @W00dyyx disc is immortal and got theirs buffed...
[1:04:18] Vigi9413: so blizzard wants us to sit CC longer? got it

[1:05:33] zachgamegodx: we will be sitting every frostbite for the full duration
[1:05:34] urchinlo: The glacial spike on mage is gonna rip people apart in the lower elos
[1:05:36] zachgamegodx: every nova
[1:05:43] zachgamegodx: unless being hard focused
[1:05:44] KaskaTV: of course they thought of this, there have a staff of 10 paid employees! and one of them thought shaman armor was too high
[1:06:05] What_ln_Tarnation: ask smexxin what he doin over there at blizz
[1:06:08] Cybernytez: hplas GTE FKD with armor changes

[1:06:53] leeka: enhance. Devo seems way too bursty
[1:06:57] zachgamegodx: you skipped over dk stuff no
[1:07:03] zachgamegodx: i feel like you did

[1:07:36] sixthycent: mages, locks, priests
[1:07:38] Solastro: the classes with stam modifiers
[1:07:39] Solastro: yea
[1:08:04] ultra_content: @jmetz75 i hope to be wrong tbh
[1:08:04] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:08:10] robdudeguylol: plate armor 30% reduction?

[1:08:13] laha1n: looking forward to a lock with 1.2mil hp fearing me while im getting hit by a chaos bolt and hes not taking any damage, its a nice meta
[1:08:17] FoxisFitness: Its like 6.5% inscrease dmg only tho
[1:08:22] ghantous: ret warrior rdruid shadowlands all over
[1:08:23] nerdyorc_: can just stun with intim shout
[1:08:29] Solastro: @laha1n they already have 1.2, itll be closer to 1.5
[1:08:30] noskinblondeguy: @laha1n with 15 second port and 45 second dark pact LUL
[1:08:42] NPBeharry: Poggers

[1:09:08] fatulina: dev evoker need more survive
[1:09:13] Eradivyn: hes talking about the illusions
[1:09:14] sixthycent: arcane mage is tankier now
[1:09:22] Gwynbleidd710: Bro that's so crazy to me. How doesn't blizzard contact top awc players? That's so insanely stupid
[1:09:24] murlad: for weps the appearances
[1:09:27] What_ln_Tarnation: @fatulina ???
[1:09:36] Cybernytez: arcane / frost mage unkillable godspecs
[1:09:40] stOgey: waterboy sam KEKW
[1:09:43] stOgey: jk
[1:09:43] shredder1111: @Gwynbleidd710 they would ask them to buff classes they play with
[1:09:59] voygard: mes on dk gonna get blasted Sadge
[1:10:29] ChumpSeason: @Gwynbleidd710 they are insanely arrogant and equally bad at what they balance
[1:10:29] stOgey: does he Q rdruid just to get games?
[1:10:29] laha1n: @shredder1111 i disagree. cdew plays with a rogue, hes outspoken about rogue as its designed right now, being bad for the game
[1:10:30] Gwynbleidd710: @shredder1111 Ehm, I don't agree with that. There's people you can ask and they'd be truthful. Plus you get opinions from people from all classes and you play around with that
[1:10:47] wackpoetic: WW already got really passively tanky recently with the magic shield and dodge chance, gonna just stand toe to toe with DK and farm them
[1:11:02] MonsterhunterP: did you practice some outlaw ele with trill and mes yet @cdewx ?
[1:11:07] mvqq: ye
[1:11:10] mitchell_xd: pvp developers always hated healers
[1:11:13] mvqq: didnt it say shaman
[1:11:18] IamWalnuts: i think he just said moonkin
[1:11:22] Gwynbleidd710: There are a lot of people who aint that biased. Maybe don't ask Pikaboo or Whazz and you should be fine
[1:11:22] mvqq: oh rly
[1:11:27] ferahgok: yea boomy got armor nerf too
[1:11:29] taylorperiod: yeah just resto
[1:11:31] sixthycent: yea its resto
[1:11:32] taylorperiod: makes no sense lmao
[1:11:35] mvqq: thats weird yeah
[1:11:35] sixthycent: ele shamans are so tanky
[1:11:37] Vigi9413: So blizz hates rsham and wants us to sit in CC longer
[1:11:43] mvqq: I just know that the devs said it was because theyd have more armor than plate
[1:11:48] brewchachi: I think bc they nerfed the other melees
[1:11:49] taylorperiod: exactly
[1:11:50] brewchachi: and plates
[1:11:56] brewchachi: so.. enh has to catch some too

[1:12:06] BeotchDaysha: ahahhaha hnerf healers lol
[1:12:08] FoxisFitness: LOLOLOLOL
[1:12:11] shredder1111: it's about consistency across the board, not that they think rshaman is op but it's lazy because there isnt more changes
[1:12:17] justaguy34921: lmao he thinks there's more than 1 guy working on PVP
[1:12:18] Gmack5: lol!
[1:12:19] nikthevoker: ITS RAINING HEALS
[1:12:22] What_ln_Tarnation: assuming devs put any thought into pvp
[1:12:23] hellotwice: rshams too tanky into melee cleaves
[1:12:27] noskinblondeguy: nerf the armor of the class no one plays LUL
[1:12:30] onlynick94: @cdewx its a dog shit game
[1:12:32] onlynick94: xd
[1:12:35] Lydiayang: I think rsham armor nerf is just mindless homogenization
[1:12:36] Solastro: dont worry that 10% evisc nerf will fix the game
[1:12:38] dinoman78: Steve get on up here, ur promoted
[1:12:38] Teak23: lol bro died in fear in the video. So topical
[1:12:49] ghantous: its such a curve ball makes u wonder if they know whats going on
[1:12:50] yaggertv: unrelated to the topic, are all of the teams for awc announced? would like to see if anything changed, was out of the loop for a bit

[1:13:07] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:13:18] jasonkbkt: Why is plate getting nerfed, warriors get the biggest dump with that nerf. Armor to the teeth means less main stat
[1:13:26] carbonzo_bean: does sterge's team have a new sponsor
[1:13:48] gizmogwuai: i think they write random shit into a piece of  papper and then put it on a ball and they then just get them from the ball randomly
[1:13:49] mvqq: what do u think about my changes https://twitter.com/Mvqdh/status/1748914347869401594

[1:14:06] voygard: KEKW
[1:14:10] sixthycent: wog needs buffed
[1:14:14] urchinlo: Do you think they placate to specific brackets in regards to changes? Like 12% reduc for u on rsham armor seems weird, but lower elo solo shuffle that helps out melee who don't quite understand to destroy totems that are healing off in the distance ? Things like that
[1:14:15] sixthycent: or remove the mana because its dog
[1:14:15] waffleberryx: nothing on hpal heals for over 100k its annoying
[1:14:18] ItsMeRevolt: Hey @cdewx do you think after the 5% healing reduction to all druid spells will make druids not meta?
[1:14:18] moldybread00: @cdewx  BUFF TO WOG
[1:14:27] IamWalnuts: i could see another increase in totem health again
[1:14:29] IamWalnuts: for rsham
[1:14:29] shredder1111: it just seems like they didnt want to put effort in so went for more general changes that shake things up
[1:14:34] IamWalnuts: my holy fires can 1 tap them
[1:14:34] Solastro: You see that Pokémon the botter signed up for AWC?
[1:14:41] dinoman78: buff hots

[3:40:02] Lionheartleo: he's just being realistic
[3:40:11] theodeth: thanks
[3:40:29] ChilledsDogTreats: there's few classes this benefits. Hunters, and Warriors for the making things squishier, and making clothies tankier just seems...wrong
[3:40:54] dubbfiend: is warrior gonna be bad next week ?
[3:40:58] Lathrien: true
[3:40:58] Jubite: frank from ontario did
[3:41:05] FlynnFluff: we should have a counter for him and that’s how many subs he has to gift

[3:41:44] misdota: personally i'd enjoy being 100-0'd while being rootbeamed, that'd be an experience
[3:41:46] evil_primate: lo

[3:43:11] Lathrien: Also with plate nerfed, feral buff, jungle will be insane again
[3:43:13] Lathrien: and ret/demo
[3:43:14] Kanoonen: How significant is the nerf, whats normal plate armour vs cloth?
[3:43:17] Cybernytez: lmao
[3:43:21] sharpdressedman15: 2 chaos bolts to the dome still running away in fear
[3:43:28] Othernate: they kinda big...
[3:43:30] gulcracko: big dog
[3:43:31] ChilledsDogTreats: Ret getting some fatty buffs

[3:48:45] Itankarenas: u going orc again?
[3:49:08] MaybeRespect: Locks double dip armor and HP buff. :/
[3:49:08] iggy_pls: tankier DPS and healers going oom faster is what that means right?
[3:49:30] Falcanus: i heard warriors are losing some strength from the armor nerf
[3:50:32] gulcracko: are classes losing the armor or losing value from the armor? if it’s the latter then Warriors probably not losing the strength
[3:50:50] dirtboyyyyy: Cdew vs pika again?
[3:51:00] Itankarenas: it's a minor buff
[3:51:14] Karaelolz: @dirtboyyyyy no

[4:00:18] Lathrien: Like enhance sham
[4:00:45] jo4sho85: is awc off new changes or old
[4:01:20] Lathrien: I think their class design team is working on the new expac or something
[4:01:21] Jubite: ret dam might be nutty tues
[4:01:21] Lathrien: idk
[4:01:33] nikkoX24X: I just wish Enhance wasn't like 12 buttons.
[4:01:34] sharpdressedman15: whens awc
[4:01:44] engzyng: so now hpalas will flop so hard to melee and priests are tanks ?
[4:02:09] Cybernytez: yeah
[4:02:13] jo4sho85: ret sub
[4:02:19] Jubite: how are you liking prevoker?
[4:02:19] sharpdressedman15: the plates that are tanky arent because of armor
[4:02:22] Lathrien: they should make melee classes also forced to melee
[4:02:43] Lathrien: instead of quasi ranged with all instants
[4:02:46] Cybernytez: disc is alredy most tanky healer and get armor buff LUL i mean im happy for my disc but my hpals will even more flop lol
[4:02:57] iggy_pls: I feel that the fears taking longer to break are just gonna make warlocks have a 5 second spammable stun
[4:03:06] brewtank: sometimes fears break insta whaazz
[4:03:13] brewtank: they do tuning with fear/roots every xpac kinda
[4:03:13] Jubite: a dev tried to fear with his UA target and it broke
[4:03:16] lem_00: so i can be in fear 90% of the game instead of 80
[4:03:18] jo4sho85: so dk blind wont break?
[4:03:20] Applezbtw: the one guy that plays aff wants to win a match vs double melee
[4:03:22] hcrzealot: I wish they would explain the rationale behind some of these changes especially before AWC.
[4:03:23] mvqq: im gonna start using my dh fear as a stun
[4:03:25] mvqq: GG
[4:03:28] IamWalnuts: Just wait and see every priest lose their mind if Death doesnt break fear anymore
[4:03:31] evil_primate: Fear doesn't break so ppl have less fun.
[4:03:39] brewtank: in tsg fear breaks insta
[4:03:42] Lathrien: They should just bring back the soul conduit for aff only or something
[4:04:00] bhoove40: I died yesterday because I wanted the ascendance heal and when I hit it the one talent had proc’d 4 sec earlier so I couldn’t get the insta healing I was tilted
[4:04:02] orcrimmar: how much dmg does root take before breaking right now?
[4:04:11] Jubite: the wowdev playing spri and affli was having a bad day so he took it out on us
[4:04:30] Machina89: @Jubite intern you mean
[4:04:42] carsmiku: is this fear thing next patch or something?
[4:04:44] lem_00: so deep roots gonna be over powered
[4:04:49] Applezbtw: double means 50k now to 100k?  doesnt seem so bad
[4:05:02] dirtboyyyyy: When is the tournament?

[4:11:15] Raefcon: why?
[4:11:20] Raefcon: why can;t he tell us?
[4:11:21] Lathrien: So the tankiest classes vs rogue will be clothies, followed by mail, plate, and leather. Makes sense
[4:11:29] firststagepizza: deep roots looking good or waht lol
[4:11:33] biofreaks: What did he say? Look at what?

[4:28:27] bubblebuddyx_: give sp night fae blinks from shadowlands but make it turn u into a void creature
[4:28:27] Lathrien: SP still will just be a worse lock that gets destroyed by other casters, plus jungle got buffed

[4:30:03] Cybernytez: human or tauren ret gearing chat? XD

[4:32:35] tonydeezerpp: i dont think the changes wil lhelp
[4:32:43] tonydeezerpp: i dont think u have time to get dmg off as rsham
[4:33:11] chrisiirc: with the casters being buffed rsham should become more prevalent
[4:33:19] MaybeRespect: Where did you get sushi this late?
[4:33:20] bubblebuddyx_: stormkeeper will be critting for near 200k now

[4:37:42] Mcnubex: I think the ret buff is going to balance them bc they need a slight buff, they are underperforming
[4:37:43] Zerolol123: @bestchaakbestjjang or rdru with ret support
[4:38:16] itz_killjoy: i dunno, most rets i see at 2500 are top dmg every match

[4:44:03] bestchaakbestjjang: DF started off so well with constant balance changes. This shit is looking worse than BFA and SL balancing now honestly
[4:44:15] chinchin23: people hate lock meta and rmp meta the most
[4:44:50] chinchin23: @bestchaakbestjjang nothing is worse than BFA that was on e big pile of shit

[4:49:58] satan2k: How come its such huge vers difference vs hpriest and disc?
[4:50:03] Cybernytez: mes coping hard Keepo
[4:50:07] bpressure: I just hope Feral Druids Dont Need a healer with their buff
[4:50:13] lilskeets: why spec nulify if he just insta spell steals it? is it just for the immunity while hes spellstealing?
[4:50:13] Lathrien: M+ nerf prolly
[4:50:29] bollskis: do you think the changes were like for average solo players
[4:50:39] mitchell_xd: the armor nerf is PvP specific @ @lathrien
[4:50:48] bestchaakbestjjang: some pvp dev prob only plays casters and got tired of melee trained in SS
[4:50:51] BruhItsKoda1: no one plays rsham in m+ anyway
[4:50:52] Freebolt: sham mastery buffed because of health... i guess
[4:51:03] pattarx: trill speaking facts
[4:51:10] Lathrien: @mitchell_xd oh right. kekw
[4:51:25] mitchell_xd: armor nerf won’t matter if it’s a wizard meta!

[4:52:24] Freebolt: instant roots wasnt good enough in tree form
[4:52:26] Freebolt: LOL
[4:52:29] meatiusloaficus: maybe they are thinking rshams can kite now cause better roots

[4:54:58] Eradivyn: its under evoker
[4:54:59] AstralScare: because shamans cant have more armor than hpala
[4:55:03] bestchaakbestjjang: @chinchin23 , they do. they got the community councils Kappa
[4:55:08] Hoodwinkel: Like i said plate users will opt into mail and leather
[4:55:20] Lathrien: because evoker is melee range most of the time
[4:55:31] pattarx: community council gotta be 1600 shufflers
[4:55:45] lilskeets: "I don't know what they've done either, but they're supposed to know" haha
[4:56:02] Frostyjoneslol: i feel like theres been ALOT of feedback on the pvp changes and i havent heard anyone say there that good, minus the druid small nerf, SP buffs like i think they need to not roll them and look at them again
[4:56:05] Lathrien: holy fuck the eu bois are back
[4:56:27] bestchaakbestjjang: using league of legends as an example, one of their devs removed pings because he got pinged in a game
[4:56:28] pattarx: is chas playing in NA now
[4:56:29] mitchell_xd: the rdruid nerf seems minimal tbh
[4:56:37] bestchaakbestjjang: prob same shit here with these devs
[4:56:57] magnesiium1: KEKW
[4:57:18] Frostyjoneslol: @mitchell_xd it should be minimal but thats a good thing. Althought i thought the assass 3% nerf wouldnt be bad and it felt AWFUL lol

[4:58:15] dooshken: so lame
[4:58:20] pattarx: after these changes, I literally have no idea which armor types will take more or less physical dam
[4:58:29] Infectshin1: Warlock hp should be wild
[4:58:40] Eradivyn: do you know de way @cdewx
[4:58:48] charmsrules: we’re moving towards call of duty
[4:58:49] WagwanBombaClatBomba: @cdewx bro warlocks will have more armor then dks
[4:58:51] WagwanBombaClatBomba: HAHAHAHHA
[4:58:57] lilskeets: i wonder what rating the guy that made the changes plays at lol
[4:58:59] Lathrien: actually inverting the classic RPG archetypes
[4:59:10] mitchell_xd: I can see rsham being close to rdruid if casters become unkillable
[4:59:12] tonydeezerpp: ive played pres dk lock yday went decent at low mmr xd
[4:59:18] felgazer: in a nutshell, why are resto druids overpowered?
[4:59:18] WagwanBombaClatBomba: holy fak boys, cloth armor having more armor then plate
[4:59:18] EFFSIN: 6k
[4:59:20] WagwanBombaClatBomba: I CANT
[4:59:20] EFFSIN: out of bear

[4:59:27] WagwanBombaClatBomba: jazggzOMEGAKEK
[4:59:30] Infectshin1: Pure physical isn't alot of damage from most classes
[4:59:37] EFFSIN: idk whats boomy
[4:59:39] Tekayama: 4 raiders from Tekayama have joined! 
[4:59:41] EFFSIN: 18k bear

[4:59:53] easyboomy_: exactly
[4:59:56] itz_killjoy: only locks not mages and priests
[5:00:02] Exitlifez: well as a MM hunter my aimed shots hit a warrior for l ike 80k compared to any leather wearer its just iinstantly doubled
[5:00:13] tangell0s: @Infectshin1 except for warriors and hunters who are almost exclusively physical
[5:00:24] dooshken: why are these changes happening?
[5:00:25] Infectshin1: Yea and outlaw
[5:00:29] tangell0s: and feral
[5:00:35] mitchell_xd: imagine them removing armor types next expansion
[5:00:38] easyboomy_: 11992 pvp
[5:00:45] pattarx: demo lock mostly physical too guys
[5:00:46] WagwanBombaClatBomba: put and aug with the warlock, for blistering scales and hes a Fyrakk boss jazggzOMEGAKEK
[5:00:47] Infectshin1: Feral bleed heavy passes armor
[5:00:54] nicecritsbro: bliz needs to hire some some awc players to consult before pushing weird changes through
[5:00:59] diuoe: hunters are gonna be disgusting
[5:01:02] lilskeets: I blame venruki, he was talking about wanting normalized armor after MM got their last round of buffs
[5:01:08] nood4e: @WagwanBombaClatBomba that sounds disgusting

[5:01:39] felgazer: @lilskeets Venruki, the Egon Spangler of wow
[5:01:40] wafflezxo: normalised armor makes sense for balancing reasons, wow players are just allergic to change
[5:01:51] ChumpSeason: making clothies tankier to melee and plate squishier to melee.., genius
[5:01:53] pattarx: also hpal gonna be more trainable now
[5:01:53] tangell0s: @lilskeets I do think that specs like MM needed some normalization, and this is one of the ways to do that i guess. Being a god against clothies and anemic against plate is rough
[5:01:54] easyboomy_: I mean boomy form getting nerf @krome2dadome

[5:03:07] Yoskexz: is guanlong the best rmd u ever faced
[5:03:10] stalecheetos: spellsteal does cost mana
[5:03:15] HypexisXD: people were running spellsteal heal glyph as arcane even back in mop and u could spam it lol
[5:03:52] easyboomy_: I don't get why they nerf boomkin form

[5:14:04] thograll: @cdewx a lot of keyboards have  settings where when you hold down the key it will "Spam" the key. This was huge during SC2

[5:14:46] Arcanocrystal: 13 per second? is he sitting in a earthquake playing?

[5:18:36] Pkbrunben: Worth dyin getting 400apm
[5:18:40] sup_champ: needed a lil more APM
[5:18:44] Pkbrunben: 😅
[5:18:44] van_hendrix: before cc hit you were just shy of 500
[5:18:50] nood4e: its not botting for high APM its the presence of botting that's tracked by apm
[5:18:53] Iol69: @dooshken hes not botting for high apm thats not what hes trying to figure out my dude
[5:18:59] krome2dadome: mes is avg 487 over an hour of combat
[5:19:00] bestchaakbestjjang: now if you double that apm, you can play as well as dekel @cdewx

[5:20:15] Metaphors: its higher cuz game was short
[5:20:19] noflamepain: did you just close ur eyes kek?
[5:20:22] faemn: depending on how sensitive these weakauras are to small movements in cameras and stuff it seems possible that an incredibly spammy person also using stuff like mousehweel could hit 800
[5:20:26] jasonkbkt: Blizzard answer to damage like that is nerf plate
[5:20:28] NenyioXz: most blind people just stretched too long at some point
[5:20:29] Metaphors: longer game it will be 300
