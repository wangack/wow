[4:02:47] SeSChilly: @wavelink95 yes and no. Get one that you can adjust. Standing at times is great but for gaming sitting is better.

[4:04:07] Jayzyzz_: @Solamire for sure, it's a very gradual process. You don't just start off by standing for 8 hours a day, maybe 30 mins, then next week an hour, then maybe the week after you can do 2 hours, etc etc
