[1:42:06] Tehsunman: But isn't that the same mindset about just playing it? You already played it LUL
[1:42:06] NBK_Sethus: just need 1 ground, 1 flying to get you where you need to be
[1:42:12] Funderik: wrath classic isn't perm, so it's a waste of time

[1:43:48] Funderik: @Alastree how are you rewarding blizzard?
[1:43:49] Gingerprimer: me
[1:43:50] 91Niki: @Alastree ???
[1:44:06] Alastree: For hitting their pre-order metrics
[1:44:09] Funderik: @Alastree you are going to buy it anyone so just buy it and you don't need to think about it.
[1:44:11] b1z49: i thinking come back df but havent watch any wow in nearly a year feel out of touch
[1:44:13] GordoHippo: @Alastree just give bobby your money already
[1:44:21] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @Alastree I dont follow ur gonna order it either way so what does it matter if u do it now or later?

[1:44:31] Alastree: Pre-order metrics
[1:44:35] Holysal: @Alastree millions of ppl pre order. you not pre ordering wont do anything lol
[1:44:50] Tehsunman: everying @ing this poor guy KEKW
[1:44:55] Tehsunman: everyone*
[1:45:01] Funderik: it's only a game, it's not that deep bro, just get the game and forget about it. why the hell are you concerned about their numbers
[1:45:02] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @Alastree Great minds think alike I literlly just said that LOL
[1:45:11] BlueBlurPrime: I unsubed to WoW at the end of M+ Season 2, so havent played the latest patch or raid but just havent felt like playing, may come back for prepatch event
[1:45:12] GordoHippo: do you think leveling now or during pre patch is better. heard prepatch bring leveling changing
[1:45:16] MrFuzzynuts420: @Alastree every game has preorder metrics. theres no escaping it these days
[1:45:20] 91Niki: @Tehsunman That happens when people say stuff that doesn't make sense LUL
[1:45:30] b1z49: is df feeling different? i quit like most people but i always come back hate my self lol
[1:45:36] Alastree: I'm probably just going to do it next week
[1:45:44] Tehsunman: @91Niki LUL touche
[1:45:51] aesirsghost: Worked on me, started back because Wrath sounded like fun, started watching your stream again and heard about all the cool new features of DF, pre-purchased DF lol
[1:46:02] L4nds1ide: can u get mounts in them boxes
[1:46:08] Funderik: @Tehsunman big true, like it matters if he preorders or gets day of release, it still adds to their numbers lol
[1:46:25] 91Niki: The only reason to not pre order a game is if you're unsure about whether you'll like it or not. Waiting to hear what people say about it, so on.

[3:14:31] mavericks312: everyone has gold on retail these days
[3:14:41] magesticals86: I've legit made 1k gold in a day on classic just selling ore/herbs
[3:14:52] remixonfire91: just do the callings everyday on a few characters ez gold per week
[3:14:52] Ertra: if you don't sell raids/m+/arena, you're not really making THAT much gold
[3:14:53] falldrgn: arent callings like 1.5K or so?
[3:14:57] Ckraigfriend: death roll
[3:14:58] magesticals86: prices are rediculously high atm
[3:14:58] remixonfire91: some callings give 2k
[3:14:59] mavericks312: just selling the ZM leggo drops the first week got you close to a mill gold
[3:15:04] therealrayred: Why even use gold in retail lol
[3:15:07] Mecabeast: people that say they are broke on retail are straight raid logging only
[3:15:11] PokerFaceMoose: doing callings on one character each day is easily 10+ a week
[3:15:28] Maldre: zerith snortis
[3:15:32] PokerFaceMoose: Paragon is like 3k which you'll get if you do callings
[3:15:33] zombie_snacks666: i make like 200k a week just from callings on all my toons
[3:15:51] ar_melol: @zombie_snacks666 jesus

[3:18:59] Kyrioz: im fury, i wanted a tank spec
[3:19:09] Mecabeast: @kyrioz tundra mammoth and dalaran ring next

[3:21:05] brownbeargaming167: Didn't ruin forging happen in WoTLK?
[3:21:10] Quecklain: at least thunderforging had a cap
[3:21:27] mavericks312: cata id say
[3:21:30] Maldre: MoP
[3:21:34] Elff11: Those thunderforged Lei Shen trinkets, good times
[3:21:38] Aidler: the *forging was a great idea
[3:21:39] Maldre: its the MoP talents
[3:21:41] TheSugma: Skip Cata Give me MOP
[3:21:53] frenzoll: CRANDY
[3:22:02] Kyrioz: i see no way they go past cata
[3:22:08] banditrox12: i just want some pandas!!!
[3:22:20] banditrox12: pandatv77777 pandatv77777
[3:22:20] koko316: Did you start levelling in Netherstorm at 67 or keep on grinding AV
[3:22:23] KronasKG: I think they should have Classic Vanilla Wrath and BC... Then they SHould speratley have "Modern" Servers Cata Mop and Wod
[3:22:34] Kyrioz: you mine as well be playing retail if they go past cata lol
[3:22:36] DanielMorenoMiniatures: NotLikeThis  classic cata....
[3:22:45] mavericks312: @Kyrioz money speaks
[3:22:49] BlewGamingGroup: i guarantee you catas coming
[3:22:52] darkwaves: if they go past cata then they have to do MoP
[3:22:53] ic3k0ld: I think they will keep releasing more, it brings in more money
[3:22:56] abracka_: the same people that voted for grimrail
[3:23:04] GonePostal101: I voted no on Cata
[3:23:18] luckfore: gonna play the shit out of MoP if that comes
[3:23:18] Mecabeast: after classic mop they announce classic wod and legion same time watch
[3:23:20] Jamagoqt: does BOA gear give bonus quest xp too or just mobs?
[3:23:21] Venkxx: cata was a great expac, except for dragonsoul, and I want them to continue just because I want MOP :D
[3:23:24] Karbonn: I loved the Shaman Cataclysm set though.....
[3:23:28] EpicJune: People say that until Dragon soul comes LUL
[3:23:29] Naturalbeef: 1000% we will get MoP as a classic
[3:23:33] rpgpro24: how is the xp addon called?
[3:23:47] magesticals86: I do want MoP 100%
[3:23:51] MagicHoof: wod classic Kappa
[3:23:51] garmin1987: !wa

[3:23:57] jetributions: but at what point is it remastered
[3:24:00] mavericks312: WoD classic dear god
[3:24:02] hwiyo: WoD classic lets goooo
[3:24:05] ic3k0ld: I don't think they will make something "new" with classic
[3:24:06] stratiss: pristine servers are becoming a reality
[3:24:10] HammerHeadShark: time for convergence of fates to roll the dps again
[3:24:13] banditrox12: i personally want WoD classic. Im a small minority Kappa
[3:24:14] EpicJune: i think they should stick with Wrath. Classic is the old world, retail is the new imho
[3:24:15] Ebo1337_PBP: Classic money grab
[3:24:18] Maldre: legion classic with 8.3 systems will be big pog
[3:24:19] soysos91: Business-wise it would make sense.  If I can potentially make money on an already made product years ago, why not release it.
[3:24:24] zeeAbe: zeeAbe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! How the hell is my sub anniversary thing already? I subbed like 2 weeks ago LUL
[3:24:25] ApexBullets: legion best expansion
[3:24:26] Maldre: err 7.3
[3:24:27] SimplyRed: Would be interesting if they took this time to go a different path than current retail. Tell a different time line story
[3:24:29] Spoonzzy: I just wish they didnt get rid of the other servers like they did with BC to wrath
[3:24:32] SymphonyOnIce: i think seasons with different affixes and loot implemented into wrath would be cool after for the new "classics"
[3:24:41] Ebo1337_PBP: yea, add a mount you get us to give $$$
[3:24:41] HammerHeadShark: Interns can get experience lol
[3:24:45] Lancasterbomber2000: Was cata bad?
[3:24:48] magesticals86: exactly, and you get the most balanced patch that was apart of the xpac
[3:24:49] Sathfire: do you think its possible for them to start brand new expansions on the classic side after Wrath? @towelliee
[3:24:53] raldrik: how long do they go until they go back to classic vanilla
[3:24:53] EpicJune: i dont think Cate, Mop, etc wont be as successful imho
[3:24:53] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[3:24:58] enivas: I hope cata falls on its face if they go that route
[3:25:07] Sathfire: that would be so cool if they started brand new classic expansions
[3:25:11] Polarisss_: am I weird to say I'd gladly play was classic too
[3:25:22] Polarisss_: wod *
[3:25:25] ic3k0ld: cata was not altogether bad, raids were hard
[3:25:29] im_capy: Getting close to a Chromie time 2.0 it seems at this rate
[3:25:29] Kyrioz: honestly just give me a good expansion and fuck classic lol
[3:25:40] Aidler: WoD classic naguuraGiggle
[3:25:42] raldrik: branch the timeline
[3:25:42] luckfore: cata++
[3:25:45] mavericks312: @EpicJune mop was a better xpac and went over better with players
[3:25:51] TollBoothVideos: Classic Classic xD
[3:25:52] mavericks312: @EpicJune then tbc
[3:25:53] Just_Jaybles: like the cataclysm never happened and its a whole new wow
[3:25:58] Sathfire: like after wrath go on a different path than they did
[3:26:01] PokerFaceMoose: change the ending to wotlk where you don't win, boom new xpac setup
[3:26:24] luckfore: are they still up?
[3:26:27] privatorius: Also, ppl get boored very fast these day so releasing cata classic is gonna be a for sure thing  i think, "new" content for ppl who hsnt experienced it before
[3:26:33] SimplyRed: Exactly, Cata never happened and we go somewhere else.
[3:26:33] TollBoothVideos: Can't wait for Wotlk Classic+ where they add storylines to it similar to OSRS
[3:26:37] revilx: those poor souls who paid to stay in classic era servers
[3:26:38] brownbeargaming167: BC actually started the entire WoW Universe
[3:26:46] im_capy: "Classic is the best"....tbc comes out "TBC is the best"...wotlk comes out "wotlk is the best".... every pre patch it seems
[3:26:55] Molvonos: Problem with 'branching out' into Classic+ is  that the reason Classic works so well is the reason Towel mentioned -- minimum resources and effort needed to set up and maintain servers.  New content means new crews similar to what's in retail.
[3:27:03] EpicJune: @mavericks312 maybe, but doubt it will be as hyped compared to vanilla, tbc, wrath imho
[3:27:45] Aidler: once we are trough all the expansion there will of course be a classic 2.0
[3:27:48] ic3k0ld: wrath had no big growth in player numbers like TBC and vanilla did
[3:27:59] abracka_: daddy microsoft tho
[3:27:59] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30. 3-4 Day Mini-Thon for Launch. Gonna hit Max Level and get some quick gear!
[3:28:00] Rohen86: This feels like they made it to appease the people that think. "If I went back to Highschool right now I'd do so many things different"
[3:28:01] ic3k0ld: just was the peak
[3:28:04] SimplyRed: Arthas Breaks the helm! KEKW
[3:28:24] TinmanFPS: @Towelliee wouldnt a new classic expansion just be a new expansion?
[3:28:25] SubLevelB: The new races look like something out of free to play
[3:28:32] Chronicxll: Rumor …they might release Cataclysm Classic?
[3:28:43] Kyrioz: Dragonflight needs to aww me in so many ways, i played shadowlands for 2mo and quit
[3:28:44] im_capy: A lot of the classic community assume the 100 devs Blizz hired for wow a while back, are a part of the classic team too. I dont think so, but thats where the hope is at
[3:28:48] SimplyRed: Now we fight along THIS lichking lol
[3:28:54] Aidler: classic+ is on the level of housing
[3:28:56] mavericks312: classic wow is for ppl who cant get over there highschool days
[3:28:58] aurelius0416: they should stop at wrath
[3:29:17] mrkenndy: @aurelius0416 they wont they like money too much
[3:29:27] Mecabeast: I'd like a classic remastered where classes played like they do currently in retail but prob alone with that
[3:29:36] mavericks312: @Kyrioz shadowlands is great now
[3:29:37] vic_ave: llike a DLC
[3:29:43] ic3k0ld: @mavericks312 I was out of high school by then LUL
[3:29:45] EpicJune: they should do a "What if" for WoW
[3:29:47] im_capy: Alternate ending
[3:29:53] Alienfromger: to much effort
[3:29:55] tkzod: they need to explore the old kingdom in depth
[3:30:00] Shirey36: then its no longer "minimal effort"
[3:30:00] abracka_: that sounds like i'd bust a towNut3 towNut3
[3:30:09] SimplyRed: Aye, they could make the places that they wanted to be actual Raids, be raids now.
[3:30:12] Venkxx: I'd rather have them do shit like that in mop, where the class design was actually great
[3:30:16] im_capy: Kill Arthus, Jailor comes out LUL
[3:30:22] BlewGamingGroup: make use of all the extra portals that never got used under wyrmrest temple for raids
[3:30:25] nocturnal_2195: I would rather see Wrath+ then cata and I am a retail andy
[3:30:27] xluckydawgx: Second DDoS attack on OW2
[3:30:29] Aidler: “alternate universe” classic expansions…
[3:30:33] vlutus1006: I'd love if the classic xpacs would carry out the ideas of prev xpacs, so i.e in WoD we could get the ogre isles, not saying we should get wod classic god no but yea.
[3:30:41] zenkodac: thats the thing the end of wrath wasnt then end of wow no matter how much people insist it was
[3:30:48] mavericks312: @xluckydawgx another one really?
[3:31:01] xluckydawgx: Yep just updated on Twitter
[3:31:02] Mahal_11532: Blizzard struggles putting out expansions one at a time, let alone on two different codebases and system philosophies
[3:31:04] Mahal_11532: would be a cluster
[3:31:15] dankmeliodas: The canceled Nerubian zone/ raid would be sick
[3:31:25] mavericks312: bro what do they think there gonna get by ddos'ing ow2
[3:31:29] Nyghtlynk: Hack the Planet
[3:31:33] theDirtyon3: its a Blizz hate thing im sure
[3:31:34] ApexBullets: Valorant kids probably
[3:31:35] Sarocus: More like an incel protest
[3:31:37] im_capy: getting some PR from it at least LUL
[3:31:48] Aidler: somebody doesn’t like OW
[3:31:53] mavericks312: like bro go hack some shit that actually does something not a game companty
[3:31:56] Lazugo: BUT MUH RIGHTS
[3:32:01] SimplyRed: Another Troll raid would be great, need to find out what that giant snake tail in Gundrak is

[4:43:40] SLoPPYALieN: @chrslp Grrrrrr... that's the shit that pisses me right off!
[4:43:50] RobNXS: Pretty suire I used TomsGuide back when I built my first pc
[4:43:57] Coffins85: I find that nowadays Warranties are completely useless.  Parts are designed and software updated to specifically fail after the warranty expires.  So I do not waste money on warranties and I have been good so far for the last 15 or so years.
[4:43:58] Murphybrown: RIP Frys
[4:43:59] chrslp: @91Niki They'll get their karma. Already consulted with a personal injury lawyer and theyre going to be getting evicted from the building at least
[4:44:03] Mister_Ript: Haha all I'm saying is the wires and ports are labeled so people know which one goes where. That's all.  And people act like its a talent only they posess
[4:44:16] 91Niki: @Mister_Ript It's because some people know how to do things, and find it easy, and lack the understanding that not everyone feels the same way. Lack of being able to put themselves in others shoes ;) It's common people problem sadly
[4:44:26] CrucifyMTG: I grew too old and hate bulding pcs now. Id rather buy pre built
[4:44:32] WestonTeli: i loooooove building
[4:44:36] Spathotan: I like Corsair hardware but iCUE is a piece of shit. Its gotta be some of the worse software
[4:44:39] vic_ave: its more then just wires and ports lets not get elitist
[4:44:40] woohdakidd: I was surpised when i built mine i didnt ruin anything
[4:44:44] Neowanderer: i miss the days of compusa and fry's electronics aka local pc parts stores now its pcpartspicker and wait for it to be shipped to ya
[4:44:47] ThaOriginalGamester: I was nervous, but i was able to build my first pc 2 months ago. so fun

[4:45:03] gritbarontv: had to make some tweaks to my Origin machine, :)
[4:45:08] therealrayred: The only good part about custom pre builts IMO - is their cable management is so much better than mine. Mine looks like a giant mess
[4:45:09] 91Niki: Some people like to make their own things, some don't. Nothing wrong with either
[4:45:13] Subtlesnipes: You can always buy the parts and have microcenter build it for you
[4:45:21] GhostVenn: its like working ona car

[4:45:22] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee yeah its a hoby
[4:45:24] firehawk73: Elmer's Glue > Thermal Paste
[4:45:37] Wulfgrym: if you have the funds to buy a prebuilt then its worth it for sure
[4:45:46] chrslp: There are plenty of build companies that dont even charge much over MSRP of the parts. They make their profit from the bulk part buying savings
[4:45:47] 1llum1n471: @firehawk73 LOL
[4:45:49] Gecko4nine: i bought my rig from Ibuypower. the GPU didnt work and they sent me a new one a few days later

[4:47:11] GhostVenn: With origin, can you swap out a part yourself without voiding the warranty/ability to get support?

[4:47:14] 1llum1n471: You don't even have to limit it to PC companies. Not many companies AT ALL offer 24/7 support
[4:47:17] r0b928: Yeah exactly. The customer service support is worth it

[5:12:02] ThaOriginalGamester: LUL
[5:12:02] Alaquane: nah. if twitch promoted turbo. people who sell stuff won't give amazon money to play the ads

[5:14:05] Shirey36: @Reddevc gas stations make very little money on gas
[5:14:08] Lazenby21: the thing people dont realize is that the increased use of EV's will drive the demand for gasoline down but increase all other energy costs
[5:14:11] SLoPPYALieN: we have charging stations at a lot of our Meijer superstores

[5:36:49] 3dRes: That song will be played during Anduin's Funeral towSip
[5:37:07] Zeerdan: ive always loved tanking as well.  its engaging and you get to set the pace
[5:38:22] Millwoods: I play Tank classes only. I dont always tank on them but i need to have that option.
[5:38:37] MaximumSerg: hes towelie the TANK not towelie the dps
[5:38:45] theDirtyon3: just play DH then Kappa
[5:39:17] Eviltuna13: I love healing because I don’t care about DPS meters
[5:39:34] SimplyRed: Ive always enjoyed playing DPS & Tanks, enjoying the fights from those 2 perspectives are great, i leave the healing to the 5 heads.
[5:39:50] SpoofAvatar: SL was poor quality all around
[5:39:51] Gingerprimer: Anduin fight encounter music is so good tho
[5:39:54] charlie_the_snowman: U ran Great Axe or S/S in NW?
[5:40:04] MysticalOS: Eh, I feel wrath soundtrack was far better than wod
[5:40:11] Glynn11: legion slaps. wotlk will always be my fave just for grizzly hills though
[5:40:11] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Honorable mention Vanilla WoW login music
[5:40:12] cashbrook: grizz hill nah wotlk soundtrac the best
[5:40:22] snowmang94: I agree about the soundtracks. I didn't mind SL overall, but just seems like the dungeons and all that got boring after running them for so long
[5:40:42] sudo_rm_rf: mop had an amazing soundtrack
[5:40:52] sudo_rm_rf: the best login theme imo
[5:41:00] DisparagingTurtle: Legion soundtracks were 11/10
[5:41:00] Mecabeast: zuldazar city music is my favorite honestly
[5:41:08] warrenny: Other than godfrey gri
[5:41:14] Bibeln: @Mecabeast TRUE
[5:41:27] pk99: every other group i'm in wants to stack for nova
[5:41:33] WonkaWash: laces were in, they were in!
[5:41:35] xxsargexx: @snowmang94 dungeons of any expansion get boring after running em for so long
[5:41:37] Farfic: disc priest you can just stack
[5:41:42] paulson14: q simulator strikes again. 30k down to 0 then didn't connect back in q 20k woot woot
[5:41:42] captiv8: i like the barrens music
[5:42:06] Relic7: Relic7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[5:42:17] snowmang94: @xxsargexx totally agree. i don't really see why SL gets so much hate IMO, i put in 20 days of play time at least since it dropped lol
[5:42:28] mastericci: Are these heroics ?
[5:42:39] pattar101: what mount drops from those ?
[5:43:01] WonkaWash: oh hell yea
[5:43:17] LearnedSomething: that's a snare
[5:43:18] captiv8: maybe your stream intro music? whatever happened to that intro?
[5:43:18] xxsargexx: @snowmang94 people exaggerate the hate for shadowlands. the dungeons were great. the raids were good. the zones were good.
[5:43:19] schneid4: you can feel it deep in ur plums
[5:43:23] Relic7: catJAM
[5:43:27] spookychefkarolina: *headbanging cat*
[5:43:32] charlie_the_snowman: HANS ZIMMER did a great job
[5:43:38] jaalexba: big cymbals
[5:43:42] Herzenliegen: I didn't like tbc
[5:43:51] xxsargexx: @snowmang94 majority of the hate comes from their hatred of the convenant system and the overall story i'd say
[5:44:03] Rodorann: hard agree
[5:44:06] WonkaWash: i feel like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis
[5:44:07] jaalexba: The Barrens music is the best
[5:44:13] snowmang94: @xxsargexx i'm with ya. I think Bastion was meh but wasn't overly offensive. I loved the dungeons, even though i got burnt after awhile. You're right - the story was ok but nothing great.
[5:44:23] MysticalOS: the wod one had the orc grunts
[5:44:27] snowmang94: @xxsargexx Covenant was fine IMO, but I can see where it turned people off
[5:44:32] xJimboJonesx: cata's just plain sucks
[5:44:41] 1llum1n471: Because I'm THAT kind of person, I just did the research. To customize a PC on Origin, it would cost me $2,429. If I went and bought it piece-by-piece to build myself, it would be $2,208. I'm fine paying $221 for someone else to put it all together, much less the support after.
[5:44:47] charlie_the_snowman: I like the scary mysterious music
[5:45:00] blooodraine: i like it
[5:45:17] akacvrtops: what one is this??

[5:45:32] akacvrtops: oh that was wrath?
[5:45:53] Herzenliegen: Cata was bad

[5:46:07] pattar101: almost sounded like star wars there
[5:46:08] WeedFranck: sound like a bad horror movie KEKW
[5:46:11] CanHasGaming: The wrath one sounds like when you see the orc army in lotr
[5:46:18] spookychefkarolina: Man. Even Catas music is sad.
[5:46:19] MysticalOS: it is
[5:46:21] MysticalOS: it was that bad
[5:46:31] BoezIRL: yes

[7:55:23] Featherbow: hubby shaved off the top of his ankle playing football, doctors were focusing on his hip and knee to the point that the ankle bone died. It's permanently broken
[7:55:27] Nokterian: I broke my left wrist years ago at school it was internal but goodness grief it was bad
[7:55:28] spookychefkarolina: Unless it’s in a position to poke you, you wouldn’t feel it.

[7:59:36] eldercandle: i hope not that sounds awful \
[7:59:40] Quojin: it would have showed in the scan
[7:59:43] KronasKG: @Towelliee  If the bone broke off. Chances are the body created a calcification around the bone to encapulate it. I would image if thats the case it woll be removed and rebuilt
[7:59:51] WonderMog: What if Towellie can grow his bones out like that Naruto character
[7:59:51] Mecabeast: if its not touch a nerve you wouldn't feel anything I think
[8:00:11] gritbarontv: or barraka
