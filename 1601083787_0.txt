[1:54:08] Matzefyr: A lot of people mistakenly think kidney shot is 7 seconds. Which is true in some scenarios, but people seem to not understand DR timers is a thing. Without making use of extremely advanced addons you will not be able to ulitize kidney shot to its full potential
[1:54:16] bodytypeone: Following the solo shuffle final, warriors have been nerf'd as a result of making it to the finals.
[1:54:17] StoneColdDime: @Farfa what? Your kidney is shot and you want a moment of silence? Ok. -gives you a moment of silence because -sings- "Rrr IIII Ppp, to the person *you used to be. Your days are ooover. Yeah, they are over." -Rita Ora

[4:15:01] wired_11: WW or MW i want them to represent
[4:15:02] dogfish314: if there were more casters then ret would not do as well
[4:15:04] PKGOD: ret just has non stop burst and it only takes 2 gcds to set up it
[4:15:05] xx_sondrak_xx: surprised at lack of warrio rep tho

[4:15:15] PKGOD: ret pain train really never stops even without wings
[4:15:16] iocaine_: @stonymontana_tv if you dont play necro you insta die as ret
[4:15:22] Lombalgie: who win?
[4:15:30] stonymontana_tv: Lies im a kyrian ret
[4:15:35] ConcernedGaming: @demonistic Brunhity (Outlaw) and Clyde (restodruid)
[4:15:42] eversmile413: EU: Rogue/Druid NA: Pala/Priest
[4:15:43] VainthVR: once outlaw gets nerfed, SSS gonna be in very good position
[4:15:45] stonymontana_tv: ww the only thing one shotting now
[4:15:45] illanxiety: ty
[4:15:46] elkaro_: pal on top
[4:16:13] Banditbill: @demonistic Vlydey won healer in emea, I forget the Rogue's name
[4:16:16] Xiunitv: i think what we can all take away from this tournament is that shadowmend needs to be removed. Glad blizz is already on the case.
[4:16:22] grommhelscream: @PKGOD like every other rogue, mage or hunter comp?
[4:16:24] Banditbill: er Clydey
[4:16:30] Knollex: Retail PvP ResidentSleeper
[4:16:51] lebnnnn: @xiunitv more like nerf rogue
[4:16:56] iocaine_: @xiunitv true it absolutely ruins the game
[4:16:56] Slayergodx: BRUNITHY god
[4:16:57] jakeslol: what is solo shuffle
[4:17:04] x51krown: everyone just screamin in the mic
[4:17:08] xx_sondrak_xx: poor abs, led self out :(
[4:17:15] stonymontana_tv: i voted for ret lol how fortunate
[4:17:19] crazymonkgonemad: has there been warlocks in this mode?
[4:17:20] MrPalomino: !standings
[4:17:22] illanxiety: @lebnnnn it was a joke
[4:17:37] ConcernedGaming: @crazymonkgonemad Yes. They didnt make it past day 1
[4:17:38] PKGOD: @grommhelscream what mage has non stop burst damage? hunter only gets kill in set up windows.. and rogues maybe outlaw has consistent pressure
[4:17:38] Moobot: AWC schedule: https://worldofwarcraft.com/esports/schedule | MDI schedule: https://twitter.com/WoWEsports/status/1546554921209798662
[4:17:39] kaoreal: I Really hope in game voice works with shuffle in DF... Seems like it could be so cool
[4:17:39] Jamienism: INTERVIEW WITH THE WINNERS?
[4:17:48] ahrivalkyrie: Rouge PVP ResidentSleeper
[4:18:01] PKGOD: however ret usually presses 2 modifiers and their TV's hit like a brinx truck everytime, even without wings
[4:18:15] lebnnnn: 'experimental season'btw, 0 balancing or tuning changes btw KEKW
[4:18:16] illanxiety: until ppl on voice start screaming gamer words
[4:18:32] alegpetrovich: does EU play vs NA now?
[4:18:38] ILikeToChopChop: are there gonna be more matches?
[4:18:43] moderatygos: we do not have cross region for this
[4:18:52] iocaine_: @PKGOD what modifiers lol
[4:18:55] grommhelscream: @PKGOD I was talking about 2 gcd setup. And remember, ret is the most vulnurable class in terms of defensives.
[4:19:04] xx_sondrak_xx: pretty sure at this level nobody's just screaming memes during match
[4:19:20] Tripsterx: @muspili you can go on clyde stream. apparently theyre gonna have a winners match EU vs US on beta
[4:19:21] funkymold: What healer won eight
[4:19:28] draz1234567: @grommhelscream lololol dshield defensive bop would disagree
[4:19:28] PKGOD: necro cov ability (not flesh) and the other ranged thing
[4:19:28] DruidQ: GlitchCat
[4:19:28] stOgey: @PKGOD what are you talking about
[4:19:44] sadccookie: @PKGOD vanq hammer
[4:19:47] xx_sondrak_xx: @funkymold idk about 8, but disc took 13
[4:19:52] lebnnnn: the next tournament will be rogue shuffle showdown, good luck with triple kidney
[4:19:55] andrew_ceo: @supatease stop calling him fuseton
[4:19:59] prikaze: Who won na
[4:20:14] SweatyDaniels: supaFlute supaFlute supaFlute supaFlute
[4:20:15] jakeslol: will solo q rank and team rank be different?
[4:20:17] PKGOD: vanq hammer has 2 charges, meaning you always have 1 to use on burst
[4:20:18] anticensor_: Kappa
[4:20:19] AstralScare: KEKW
[4:20:21] Frizankbeast: LUL Ziqo
[4:20:25] jakeslol: like separate mmrs
[4:20:25] xx_sondrak_xx: classic ret pally voter imo :p
[4:20:31] KevinG216: I can‚Äôt wait to see the next tourney for solo in DF

[4:20:57] iamreallyafan: Who won overall?
[4:21:05] laundrevity: kalvish pog
[4:21:07] moderatygos: @foxyllama great job competing! enjoyed the games'
[4:21:10] grommhelscream: @draz1234567 bop gets purged instantly usually and both can be used once in an arena
[4:21:13] Zetherior: BIS EVENT EVERYONE <3
[4:21:15] Ryzeneutv: @dipicat thanks for repping! <3
[4:21:16] stOgey: @foxyllama great games
[4:21:17] Bicmexwow: <3 thanks for the invite
[4:21:18] Sebleh: Boomkin superiority! seblehConvoke
[4:21:21] celtzgod: killing through turtle, casual outlaw gaming
[4:21:22] anticensor_: I am gonna come back to DF only because of ranked soloq TBH
[4:21:25] grommhelscream: or how about mages stealing it lol
[4:21:27] xx_sondrak_xx: commentators discriminate against ret pally :(
[4:21:31] PKGOD: vanq hammer and judgment, it buffs TV. you almost always have them lineup, so even without wings if you connect youre doing unhealable dam
[4:21:32] symptomV: atta boy kid
[4:21:34] draz1234567: @grommhelscream you can say that about alot of abilities
[4:21:34] miscxnduct: Is it over?
[4:21:44] celtzgod: @Bicmexwow wp my dude
[4:21:46] thebigdbandit: Good call on Kalvish, insane player.
[4:21:51] oslim1: whats the price?
[4:21:53] PKGOD: its why ret/war has dominated all expansion, they dont really require set up on healers or cross cc to get kills. with or without cooldowns
[4:21:55] chuzaman: @miscxnduct at last my son. no solo shuffle lasts forever
[4:21:56] qkmood: fun tourny
[4:22:00] droledian27: rip hunter in DFA
[4:22:03] grommhelscream: @draz1234567 you cant purge most wall defensives
[4:22:04] cailcail1: Is it over+
[4:22:05] loveshock7: sad to see every caster trained and melting
[4:22:07] lebnnnn: invite drainer and mvq to the next tournament please
[4:22:07] Frizankbeast: It was really nice to see the variety
[4:22:17] iocaine_: @PKGOD judgement isn't giving a crazy buff to TV, vanq is what gives the burst off wings
[4:22:19] forshard: the Link NotLikeThis
[4:22:22] xx_sondrak_xx: CHICKEN WINGS
[4:22:42] ConcernedGaming: Deviant Cleave is the best Comp name

[4:23:01] ModeraYsera: This was an enjoyable and amazing show, I had a lot of fun and I hope you did too. Thank you guys for hanging out with us, I hope you all have a happy Sunday! <3
[4:23:02] grommhelscream: the only reason ret did well there was no caster thanks to outlaw rogues
[4:23:02] Baguette__tv: Solo shiffle is a really fun bracket
[4:23:05] xx_sondrak_xx: ppl can't handle kfc cleave, its no mere "standard comp"
[4:23:17] xDecadenceTV: @ConcernedGaming Man has clearly never heard of Scooby-doo cleave
[4:23:37] PKGOD: are you insane? it gives you an extra 25% damage which buffs both that and the echo damage you can get from a TV
[4:23:42] Kurusnow: how do you get this ui?
[4:23:46] ConcernedGaming: @ConcernedGaming I ahve, Deviant Cleave still funnier.
[4:23:51] BiggityBop: 1 vs 1 brackets would be fun too.
[4:23:59] xx_sondrak_xx: does seem like mage kinda pre-lost to sheer number of rogues
[4:24:00] moderatygos: definitely a fun event this weekend
[4:24:00] Larelulw: !bracket
[4:24:01] DaxKingo: We love Ziqo!
[4:24:03] PKGOD: it absolutely makes it a massive hit, EVEN without wings up. thats the point im trying to explain. done wasting time tho. gg Ret
[4:24:05] whatdatmean: solo shuffle much better to watch then normal arena
[4:24:10] blackvpnv: fix solo shufle bug pls

[5:10:40] HimuraLOL: Trill didn't get the e-mail warning him to tune down his build so he don't get nerfed
[5:10:44] KevinG216: I guess a lot of people in chat can‚Äôt read that this is an untuned beta.
