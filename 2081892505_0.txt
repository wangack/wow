[0:14:42] RAF_Sean: I'd be in a coma if I was up until 3am
[0:14:43] Lausten: Nothing good happens after 2 AM..
[0:15:02] Lestatis: @Lausten solid ted mostby
[0:15:08] Lestatis: mosby*
[0:15:10] RAF_Sean: Bad habits lead to late nights
[0:15:10] Layliah79: Bad habits!! love that song
[0:15:18] RAF_Sean: Who?
[0:15:23] Lestatis: it's also from how i met your mother!
[0:15:29] Lausten: @Lestatis Just rewatching the series, thats why it came to mind
[0:15:36] RAF_Sean: Could you sing a bar or two of his jungles?
[0:15:38] Layliah79: I'm in bed by 10:30pm each night. 5:40am comes early
[0:15:39] RAF_Sean: >.>
[0:15:44] RAF_Sean: jingles*
[0:16:01] Elrathir: not me having been up until nearly 5, oopsie
[0:16:33] AlanC2024: Sunny as ever here in Cornwall. You may be getting what I got yesterday
[0:16:47] MediumRareOG: Look on the bright side: it'll be summer soon and this will never happen again
[0:16:48] Layliah79: wonder if they will do Blizzcon tickets earlier this year - maybe April?
[0:16:51] wastedxtime93: @Elrathir same. My normal schedule usually involves gaming until like 3/5am, then getting up for the day just a couple hours later.
[0:17:01] Layliah79: OH really.
[0:17:21] wastedxtime93: Probably. War Within dead already, didn't you know?
[0:17:33] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[0:17:34] Layliah79: it's going to be 90F today. well above average temps for TX

[0:19:23] AlanC2024: same
[0:19:32] profienn: isnt next week the next mini patch?
[0:19:35] Lausten: mrgmHey
[0:19:41] SlithTheSivak: seasonally affective disorder is a real thing
[0:19:46] devilbride: deceDrachi weltre2HI
[0:19:46] alextheblight: can we watch the last 3 minutes of your new video? I turned it off for this stream
[0:19:59] profienn: thought march 14th was the patch with the skull that no one knows anything about
[0:20:06] alextheblight: aw
[0:20:30] wastedxtime93: I saw a Tweet yesterday saying how the complete lack of any info at this point is just killing the hype for 10.2.6 and I couldn't agree more.
[0:20:41] alextheblight: dynamic ground mounts are an interesting concept
[0:20:41] AlanC2024: I am glad it's sunny today. Got a cat to take to the vet for yearly checkup. I l can walk there. Would not want to in the rain
[0:21:07] Layliah79: haha it does look good
[0:21:11] SlithTheSivak: so w the sky captain set on the trading post, u think the pirate stuff is going to be skyships? like the arathi have in hollowfall?
[0:21:13] Lausten: No alpha dynamic ground mount footage? So disappointed Kappa
[0:21:19] alextheblight: I was wondering if it was bugged
[0:21:22] RAF_Sean: I love that
[0:22:15] SlithTheSivak: im mad! i need to know how to plan my mog
[0:22:19] profienn: i know a good way of not making people talk, money lmao
[0:22:32] Lausten: A pirate maskerade, that sounds awesome
[0:22:38] wastedxtime93: idk the lack of any news whatsoever has me bored out of my mind. Ive barely touched WoW in the past month.
[0:22:47] keyboardturner: just pay off blizzard to leak secrets
[0:22:48] profienn: oh thats fair
[0:23:03] Tauren0309: Afternoon Dan
[0:23:07] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite devoNOTE
[0:23:16] SlithTheSivak: YUS
[0:23:17] Layliah79: I think they are misleading us with it all
[0:23:20] BBMezzy: mrgmHehe
[0:23:21] RAF_Sean: No you didn't
[0:23:23] Elrathir: LUL
[0:23:23] SlithTheSivak: yo ho ho
[0:23:31] Elrathir: even if no pirates, wear it
[0:23:32] RAF_Sean: You mad lad
[0:23:34] Layliah79: that's awesome!
[0:23:34] keyboardturner: privateer outfit
[0:23:42] AlanC2024: You might not be the only one
[0:23:49] profienn: it might not even be pirates at all lmao
[0:24:09] Layliah79: either way the hat will be BIS
[0:24:21] MachoCham: I just started the main event and made me sad that Sting never came to WWE after his 18months was up on his turner contract
[0:24:29] MachoCham: The matches we never got...
[0:24:53] succulentjeffery: succulentjeffery subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[0:25:20] profienn: i mean they really didnt address the scourge not going crazy after the helm was broken
[0:25:46] alextheblight: ayep
[0:25:58] MachoCham: @keyboardturner I need your brains! The WowLua broke me last night :(
[0:26:01] alextheblight: I can't believe they just went "we fixed that" after SL
[0:26:19] profienn: and apparently going back to northrend in the next expansion and the scourge will have to be dealt with some how
[0:26:22] alextheblight: burger king crown
[0:26:24] RAF_Sean: Helm of Undomination
[0:26:28] KaisenSiru: Crown of Wills
[0:27:42] profienn: they should have never said the jailer was behind everything since way back to warcraft 1, that was terrible
[0:27:50] MachoCham: I'm so glad Arthas got turned into anima. The story is over and it's no longer the "In case of emergency"

[0:28:03] UlthraneDK: Video was a banger
[0:28:10] alextheblight: we got a lot of burger king crowns in game now, now that I think about it
[0:28:23] MachoCham: Can't remember who said it the other day but Arthas was a mid character, it was everyone around him who made the story interesting
[0:29:10] RAF_Sean: Cham woke up and chose violence
[0:29:13] MachoCham: I do
[0:29:26] databob1: Sounds like copium
[0:29:44] MachoCham: 10.2.6 will either be the best patch ever or it's another S.E.L.F.I.E. patch
[0:29:47] Jaythebard: wassup
[0:29:51] profienn: i havent even logged into wow for like 4 weeks, feelsbad but breaks are good
[0:30:04] wastedxtime93: Yep, I feel it. My PS5 has gotten plenty of playtime over the past 2 months. WoW is pretty boring atm for me.
[0:30:18] JMT_101: the fact we don't really have an idea when it'll release doesn't help
[0:30:22] profienn: last epoch has me in a headlock and i'm not willing to break out lmao
[0:30:32] databob1: Dead game RIP
[0:30:39] wastedxtime93: Yeah, after the archives patch, there really isn't much other than the same old raid and dungeons.
[0:30:41] MachoCham: I still find Last Epoch really daunting
[0:30:55] MachoCham: Even playing it, it seems complex and guides just make it worse
[0:30:59] MachoCham: Maybe I should just play connect 4
[0:31:03] wastedxtime93: Yeah, but once again, just another rehash.
[0:31:04] MediumRareOG: The issue isn't no PTR. it's just too long with no info. you can't maintain anticipation that long without "fuel"
[0:31:06] KaisenSiru: I went to Korthia on my alchemist to get missing recipes with Mawshrooms and the place was filled with activity
[0:31:12] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:31:34] Elrathir: Yep
[0:31:46] wastedxtime93: Holly, take notes!
[0:32:05] MediumRareOG: that's what i mean by "fuel". they could've just done weekly teasers, for example
[0:32:18] MachoCham: I think for all of us in the content creator niche and following online - it's been a bit crap. But we are the minority, the majority of players who are casual who have no idea on any of this I can't imagine it's affecting too much. We're all spoilt
[0:32:33] SlithTheSivak: Historically "surprises" aren't a great way to generate hype, if people are on a break and have no notion of when content is coming or what it pertains, its impossible to be excited
[0:32:43] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove

[0:33:59] Layliah79: reset day for us (NA)
[0:34:01] JMT_101: its chewsday innit
[0:34:04] Phats66: the player base is going to be more emo than normal if its a subpar patch
[0:34:22] BBMezzy: Blizzard themselves said we WoW players want to know what's coming, which is why they're continuing with the roadmaps. But right after saying that they're going silent on what is coming with the next patch.
[0:34:27] UlthraneDK: Crawwwwlllinnnnnnnggggg
[0:34:28] MachoCham: Wow Community - Wish things were secret and we didn't get spoilt on things. Also Wow Community - I NEED INFORMATION I'M BORED
[0:34:59] SlithTheSivak: i dont like secrets or surprises, i like to be prepared...
[0:35:29] MachoCham: They also said this was an experiment to see how going in blind for the player base is
[0:35:41] databob1: They think we want surprises but we don't
[0:35:46] Layliah79: i think right after
[0:35:56] Phats66: after mdi
[0:35:59] MediumRareOG: It's also weird that the 10.2.6 blackout also means there can be no 10.2.7 PTR or news really
[0:36:14] SlithTheSivak: nearly 20 years of patches under their belt and now they are experimenting with content releases...
[0:36:18] MachoCham: @databob1 You say that, but check twitter for people who say that PTR should be abolished and be like Final Fantasy
[0:36:51] MediumRareOG: what addon is tracking the ravenous cells?
[0:36:58] Lausten: Now you can ride indoors
[0:37:20] meezgrind: robx3Hey robx3Hey robx3Hey
[0:37:28] Lausten: The most useless thing in Torghast

[0:37:48] meezgrind: hiya @Layliah79
[0:38:11] SlithTheSivak: just thematically, paladins and priests shoulda done bonus damage in revendreth, maldraxus, and torghast
[0:38:23] Lausten: Ahh I lost my Fearless Spectator title once again.. ResidentSleeper
[0:38:35] meezgrind: This stream not brought to you by Starbucks? :)
[0:38:49] MachoCham: I think I woke up and chose violence today
[0:38:52] Basilwheat: Good afternoon Mr GM , whats ur overall % on ATT?
[0:39:00] MachoCham: Might be time to get some sleep and touch the grass
[0:39:10] Basilwheat: huge,gz!
[0:39:22] NeeK_23: @MachoCham actually me, I wanna see all story chapters hidden
[0:39:25] Basilwheat: KEKW true
[0:40:11] Elrathir: wow look at all them legendary materials
[0:40:14] Elrathir: so useful
[0:41:37] RAF_Sean: Ok be back in a bit. Gotta go fight CHam in DMs for his Arthas take
[0:41:50] RAF_Sean: lol I kid
[0:41:54] MachoCham: Don't @ me
[0:42:12] MachoCham: Spoilt rich kid loses his horse so goes on a genocidal rage killing his father
[0:42:17] MachoCham: KEKW
[0:42:19] UlthraneDK: *King Arthas, signed DK
[0:43:34] MachoCham: I also know the digs were a bit rough on the ol content but in Dragon Soul we would have killed for even that every 8 weeks
[0:43:43] Lunabcs: finally catched you live always seem to miss these :D
[0:44:01] NeeK_23: Arthas is dead, Long Live Queen Calia.....that should get the lore people going for a while xD
[0:44:25] CloudyHS: surprise 10.2.6 news incoming
[0:44:45] CloudyHS: KEKW
[0:44:52] Layliah79: we need some kind of news. we're in such a drought over here.
[0:44:53] SlithTheSivak: theres a bet on my server its today
[0:45:00] CloudyHS: bare minimum we get a release date
[0:45:16] NeeK_23: my client just updated
[0:45:19] CloudyHS: could be next week or a surprise
[0:45:19] magemaster225: youd have to preload the patch probs, theyd prob announce it beforehand
[0:45:25] MachoCham: It will be really dog shit if it's not global for a hidden patch
[0:45:30] keyboardturner: wasn't it just regular update
[0:45:31] CloudyHS: pausechamp
[0:45:32] SlithTheSivak: everyone agrees it wont be during the hearthstone event, which is next week, and blizz said 10.2.6 was early march so...
[0:45:38] Layliah79: i got an update in the game last night.
[0:45:47] Layliah79: boo
[0:45:58] Dennis410: What do you make of Metzen tweet?
[0:46:00] BBMezzy: They did not say early, just march
[0:46:16] Lausten: She just said march
[0:46:37] NeeK_23: Metzen hasnt tweeted since blizzcon
[0:47:00] dright424: he replied to tweets
[0:47:09] CloudyHS: the HS event ends on the 18th, monday, 10.2.6 launch on the 19th, simple
[0:47:27] lyreilla: Happy Tuesday!
[0:47:50] Dennis410: Sorry please ignore lol. Twitter is not easy to sort while driving
[0:47:51] MachoCham: Must be a hint for the patch content

[0:47:57] NeeK_23: its a line from a movie
[0:47:59] Elrathir: feels like they're quoting something from pop culture
[0:48:03] CloudyHS: movie reference
[0:48:22] MachoCham: Is the movie pirates of the Caribbean monkaHmm
[0:48:24] NeeK_23: tombstone from 90s
[0:48:25] UlthraneDK: It's a reply to Scott Johnson, they're bromancers
[0:48:32] Lausten: @Dennis410 Get off Twitch. Drive instead.. NotLikeThis
[0:48:47] Elrathir: ...so it must be a hint of a new WARCRAFT MOVIE!!! :d
[0:49:06] CloudyHS: if a cop sees you , youll get pulled over
[0:49:09] CloudyHS: just a matter of time
[0:49:11] MachoCham: Or in Rum's case, don't use voice activation because it's bonkers sometimes LUL

[0:49:23] CloudyHS: nah its illegal everywhere
[0:49:36] SlithTheSivak: its considered distracted driving
[0:49:42] MediumRareOG: i heard a story yesterday where a cop was texting and driving, rear ended someone and then tried to ticket them for brake checking him. the guy had a dash cam though
[0:50:02] lyreilla: Just bc it's illegal doesn't stop ppl.
[0:50:22] lyreilla: Pretty sure it's illegal everywhere in the US
[0:50:24] MediumRareOG: yes, the cop was texting and driving
[0:50:26] CloudyHS: how does that surprise you have you SEEN NA cops KEKW
[0:50:33] MachoCham: I love a cheeky brake test on people who decide to fly right up behind me
[0:50:33] Zeira_Wolf: Hello! In your dynamic ground video on YouTube, when you were running in the maw, you were riding some kind of small brown mount with big ears and with a purple and yellow saddle, what mount would this be?
[0:50:43] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:51:05] Zeira_Wolf: nope
[0:51:07] Zeira_Wolf: it had big ears
[0:51:10] Zeira_Wolf: and it was brown
[0:51:15] Zeira_Wolf: hmmm
[0:51:15] Amyrantha_: yea
[0:51:18] Amyrantha_: that'll be it
[0:51:20] Zeira_Wolf: i dont thinkk? let me go see
[0:51:20] CloudyHS: wtf is this song
[0:51:30] CloudyHS: rubber bands the song
[0:51:32] Zeira_Wolf: OH yeah
[0:51:34] Zeira_Wolf: ty!!
[0:51:52] Zeira_Wolf: was really wondering about that LOL
[0:52:02] Zeira_Wolf: saw it and wanted it
[0:52:13] CloudyHS: korthia
[0:52:19] Zeira_Wolf: bringing back ptsd
[0:52:22] MachoCham: My favourite thing to do with Dan is ask him what mount he was just using as he uses random mounts KEKW
[0:52:44] CloudyHS: remember when they added like 15 ultra rare shoulder transmogs that drop from mawsworn chests in korthia? thats cool. ive opened 3 of them every day since 9.1 and only have 4 of them
[0:53:18] CloudyHS: yes every day monkaS

[0:54:25] Zeira_Wolf: i could never keep running torghast after getting all of the mounts from it
[0:54:29] Zeira_Wolf: way too painful
[0:54:48] Zeira_Wolf: es
[0:54:49] Zeira_Wolf: easy
[0:54:56] Zeira_Wolf: quick to run trough it
[0:54:58] Guffels: being overpowered in wow feels fun\
[0:55:13] NeeK_23: power fantasy vs overcoming a challenge
[0:55:22] MediumRareOG: I heard about people who only play an expansion once the new expansion comes out. It sounded weird but I totally get it now
[0:55:30] Zeira_Wolf: the thing with torghast is it looks so gray and ugly, i cant stand to look at it for hours lol island expeditions im more ok with
[0:55:33] MachoCham: If I wanted a challenge I'd ask the wife for a good time
[0:55:38] NeeK_23: doing visions at level felt really rewarding, but just blasting though is also fun
[0:55:51] CloudyHS: 100%ing torghast on all the things is one of my proudest wow achievements
[0:55:55] Zeira_Wolf: LOL
[0:56:14] CloudyHS: oh that ones easy, theres an exploit
[0:56:19] CloudyHS: check the wowhead comments
[0:56:21] MediumRareOG: there's apparently a way to cheese the 250k phantasma
[0:56:26] NeeK_23: yeah im still working on that one 180k so far
[0:56:46] MediumRareOG: cheese is a better word than exploit :)
[0:57:02] Lausten: Its not an exploit, its clever use of game mechanics
[0:57:03] Phats66: creative use of game mechanics
[0:57:10] CloudyHS: you know that torment where it spawns a blob that consumes your phantasm? if you have the +% anima drop power, it will keep increasing it every time
[0:57:14] CloudyHS: so it drops more than it took
[0:57:18] CloudyHS: and it scales exponentially
[0:57:25] MediumRareOG: getting all the torghast tmogs is rng hell
[0:57:35] SinicalDev: Afternoon mate
[0:57:46] NeeK_23: day 5 of seeing if the right WQ is up, lets hope
[0:58:10] SlithTheSivak: recently got a 5 year old bug fixed in less than 30 days after a forum post...it was an "exploit"
[0:58:24] MachoCham: Dan can I ask a cheeky favour for a call to arms for anyone in chat who knows WowLua to drop me a message? <3
[0:58:24] NeeK_23: reset on saturday evening
[0:59:13] MachoCham: Thank you <3
[0:59:39] NeeK_23: the WQ was not up

[1:01:02] MediumRareOG: 2 hours and the comp stomp marathon begins
[1:01:32] MediumRareOG: i'm doing the comp stomp weekly on 88 toons
[1:01:42] SinicalDev: decent to queue into if youre doing completionist though
[1:02:04] l3k13: suffle was about 8-10 min dps ques earlier
[1:02:27] SinicalDev: im waiting for the solo RBGs tbh Arena is the only part of wow that ive never really played, think i got 1500 in wrath and that was it
[1:02:31] SinicalDev: but cata/mop i rinsed RBGs
[1:02:45] KaisenSiru: I've been doing BG Blitz with a friend as healer/dps queing, and theyve been pretty fun. Its hard to go back to regular random BGs after Blitz. Can';t wait til Blitz becomes rated
[1:02:57] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:03:03] l3k13: there are still ppl leaving but most games i played today were played to the end
[1:03:16] Elrathir: Blitz is my favorite mode of pvp tbh
[1:03:32] LouOfc: Do we know when season 4 m+ will start yet?
[1:03:33] Elrathir: mount go zoom
[1:03:49] KaisenSiru: 8v8, faster mounting, pace with capping, slightly different rules with some maps
[1:03:51] l3k13: faster and fewer players
[1:03:54] MachoCham: I'd expect early April if I had to put money on it
[1:04:16] BBMezzy: It depends on what they end up doing for season 4
[1:04:17] KaisenSiru: Yep mounted speed is like 200%
[1:04:25] SinicalDev: i need to complete KSM then
[1:04:35] SinicalDev: This is the first expac ive got every KSM and AOTC in
[1:04:52] BBMezzy: If it's just a rehash then an april season 4 seems likely, if it's actual new things then I'd say may for season 4
[1:05:02] nash25pl: @MrGM just buy a last kill ;) AOTC ez
[1:05:19] SinicalDev: i think its like 30k gold now tbf lol
[1:05:20] nash25pl: @MrGM last boss kill is 75k gold
[1:05:24] nash25pl: i think
[1:05:29] Iternativ: When do you think 10.2.6 comes out?
[1:05:44] nash25pl: raid on HC boost are cheap !
[1:05:46] BBMezzy: Just DF dungeons again is the most likely scenario, i'm just hoping they do do an affix refresh for season 4. Which then would require testing
[1:05:57] SinicalDev: they said S4 will have open world content, but not sure if thats just updating the ilevel of the rewards
[1:06:02] MediumRareOG: i did saw floor completion 81% and thought "that's no way to get to the adamant vaults"

[1:17:20] Lausten: Sorry we were busy making a new baby, we are gonna need an extra room Kappa
[1:17:44] SinicalDev: We're doing a 5% deposit, and found out today that we're expected to pay 10% as an exchange deposit... now going back to the sellers solicitors to ask them to lower it but wasnt fun to wake up to that
[1:18:21] SinicalDev: the exchange deposit is held so if you pull out you pay a penalty to the sellers
[1:18:34] MachoCham: Good old days when you used to be able to do a 100% mortgage
[1:18:51] MachoCham: As in 0 deposit
[1:19:07] KaisenSiru: anniesGasp
[1:19:09] SinicalDev: 5% seems quite common but they're more restrictive, no flat roof flats, cant be a new build etc. depends on the lender
[1:19:10] MachoCham: It was
[1:19:15] magemaster225: yeah US has rural programs for 0% down 30year loans
[1:20:19] Mordotzz: oh damn i forgot the maw boss rotation again zz
[1:20:37] SinicalDev: i saw a tiktok of some boomer who bought a house for Â£15k and then sold it 5 years ago for Â£650k loool
[1:21:17] MachoCham: @SinicalDev Before saying that it's easy to get on the property ladder
[1:21:36] SinicalDev: just stop buying costa coffee and avocados
[1:21:49] MachoCham: Just buy a house 4head
[1:22:00] Mordotzz: i found starbucks to be much nicer than costa imho
[1:22:07] Mordotzz: pret i found to be the best
[1:22:15] MachoCham: I've given up milk in mine
[1:22:30] Mordotzz: i was actually surprised how nice some food choices were in some prets
[1:22:34] MachoCham: And just take double espresso now, but I buy the grounds not instant
[1:22:44] Mordotzz: havent tried tim horton is it common?
[1:23:07] Mordotzz: i'll look out for when im in london next time
[1:23:09] SlithTheSivak: starbucks is king, seattle represent
[1:23:14] SinicalDev: The burgers are fucking hanging, tasted like a rustlers
[1:23:18] SinicalDev: the timbits are good though
[1:23:28] SlithTheSivak: Seattle's Best
[1:23:34] Mejafo: have you tried the tim's dark roast coffee
[1:23:36] Mordotzz: starbucks kinda mid here tbh
[1:23:40] SlithTheSivak: SBC is great
[1:23:44] Mordotzz: much better in the UK
[1:24:30] SlithTheSivak: our local coffee scene is where it's at though, i go to a place where their coffee maker looks straight out of a steam punk movie
[1:24:59] SlithTheSivak: coffee and depression

[1:29:06] Mordotzz: shame for those local shops
[1:29:51] SinicalDev: M&S Sparks card is decent, every now and again they give a free loaf of bread or some cookies
[1:29:55] Lausten: Just give me my coffe cheaper and fuck off with your cards, apps and what not.. LUL
[1:29:56] SinicalDev: got 20% off some shoes the other day
[1:30:08] adampanerabread: yo!
[1:30:22] SinicalDev: Some m&s stuff is cheaper than aldi, the pasta and other staples are super cheap tbh
[1:31:44] MachoCham: Yep
[1:31:51] SinicalDev: Clubcard is good, I've got Â£30 in vouchers which gets doubled if you use it on vouchers for places like cineworld etc.
[1:32:17] MachoCham: The prices have gone up and then clubcard etc brings it back down to previous prices in exchange for your data and soul
[1:32:23] MachoCham: I do expect it to be regulated at some point
[1:32:23] SinicalDev: Sainsburys do nectar pricing as well now, their app is like asda/tesco/m&s all in one which their selling tactics
[1:32:48] Mordotzz: whats wrong w the map
[1:32:57] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:33:00] Lausten: But Korthia was such a small zone Kappa
[1:33:01] SinicalDev: They've just been pressured into showing the unit pricing for clubcard prices which is good

[1:33:32] Jelky55: yo sup
[1:33:41] Jelky55: im greeeeeeeattt u?
[1:34:17] Big_D_notnice: Just did the math on gearing a new character to fully upgraded heroic and crafted and it takes 30 Wyrm Dungeons and 50 Aspect dungeons.... How is that a thing??
[1:34:20] Jelky55: i ve read the twitter post LMAO , use that to charge up so u dont run on fumes !
[1:35:08] Jelky55: oh ye gearing new alt atm sucks lmao
[1:35:54] audemus22: Whens season 4 out
[1:35:57] adampanerabread: do we have any dragonriding experts in here? I have a question
[1:36:04] Lausten: @Big_D_notnice Gearing? As in max level gear? Cause I wouldnt call that gearing I would call that min maxing
[1:36:05] MachoCham: Depends if we get any catchup stuff in 10.2.6
[1:36:24] Jelky55: dont forget that u are doing content in the Maw Dan, back when rep grinding and all that shit was slow af cuz we... u remember xD
[1:36:24] Harai_Ulfsark: i have all dragonriding achievements if that matters
[1:36:28] Elrathir: I am a dragonriding noob sorry
[1:36:35] NeeK_23: gearing is part of the fun of playing. Im playing a new alt atm. Just getting it instantly to 486 wouldnt feel like i've earnt anything
[1:37:34] Harai_Ulfsark: yeah even the collection ones, was a pain bc for the longest time the dark mane for the cliffside wylderdrake was bugged for some accounts (mine included)
[1:37:35] goekenaitor: I am just gearing all my alts simultaneously. I have like 8 toons between 451 and 458
[1:38:22] MachoCham: Yeah I hear you on that
[1:38:42] Harai_Ulfsark: the manuscripts should be pretty high drop rate, except the zaralek treasure one
[1:38:50] BBMezzy: At least with follower dungeons you now have an instant queue into them
[1:38:57] death_cam_: was so annoyed at the love is in the air manuscript
[1:39:06] death_cam_: you can check wowhead comments on it
[1:39:35] adampanerabread: I'm just now noticing this. when I use vigor, dismount & then remount, the vigor in the newest cell will reset it's recharge % back to 0, even if it's about to fill a whole vigor out. how long has this been a  thing LUL
[1:39:48] MachoCham: I think I need two manuscripts in the cavern
[1:39:50] Big_D_notnice: @Lausten I would say yea its kinda min/max but this late into the expac why is there no catchup? If each dungeon takes you 25 minutes you'd have to do 34+ hours of dungeons just to be caught up with most mythic raiders.
[1:40:11] SinicalDev: I hope every expansion we get a new customisable mount
[1:40:14] MachoCham: I guess the catchup gear is the one for flightstones after getting 1k rating in M+3
[1:40:41] Harai_Ulfsark: @adampanerabread probably since they fixed the tindral recharge rate, also for a while since 10.2.5 we would login with our vigor bar completely empty
[1:40:44] Lausten: @Big_D_notnice There is catch up. Its just not the item level you want it to be..
[1:41:03] goekenaitor: @Big_D_notnice you can't expect it to be fast to catch up to a mythic raider if you aren't doing any raiding. That time is cut quite a bit if you clear heroic every week and do like 2 or 2/9 M
[1:41:17] BBMezzy: :D
[1:41:21] goekenaitor: 2 or 3
[1:41:29] Big_D_notnice: @Lausten Where as if I pvp, I could spend way less time and get full conquest gear and be caught up
[1:41:53] death_cam_: i hope they keep the flightstone upgrade paths on DF gear after TWW launches for tmog collecting purposes
[1:42:16] CianoHD3: i wonder if there will be a new 3 vigor spell for diffrent mount types like the gryphons one
[1:42:40] death_cam_: yeah i found that kinda stupid otherwise i would of ran abberus lfr
[1:42:49] BBMezzy: I'm still holding onto season 2 gear on alts just incase they reenable the upgrading for transmog.. probably huffing the copium on that one
[1:42:51] Lausten: @Big_D_notnice I honestly got no idea how the pvp item level works, but I still believe that there is a better gear reward for pvp that also requires investing more time than someone that just caught up?
[1:42:53] death_cam_: and they would cost only flightstones
[1:42:53] MachoCham: I mean yes they are
[1:43:03] goekenaitor: probably saving people from themselves by wasting flightstones
[1:43:13] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[1:43:29] Lausten: But it literally says with grey letters on it, "season 2"
[1:43:40] death_cam_: wouldnt really be a waste of flightstones when your current season gear has higher ilvl resulting in cheaper upgrades on tmog gear
[1:43:44] RevoIizan: did reset already happen?
[1:43:58] MachoCham: @RevoIizan Tomorrow :(
[1:44:08] calphan84: NA is going down in 8 minutes
[1:44:18] Harai_Ulfsark: NA should be down or going down soon
[1:44:22] Thoreya: flightstone acquisition should be much higher
[1:44:28] Lausten: @RevoIizan NA? LUL
[1:44:44] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:44:46] Harai_Ulfsark: yes im actually starved on flightstones
[1:44:46] RevoIizan: thank you @calphan84
[1:44:56] Thoreya: did u see hollys reponse about 10.2.
[1:44:59] MachoCham: Flightstone cap on my Shaman but drought on my others
[1:45:00] Thoreya: 10.2.6 8 mins ago
[1:45:11] KaisenSiru: Pog
[1:45:16] NeeK_23: sent it to Cham
[1:45:44] Thoreya: lol
[1:45:59] NeeK_23: maybe a post later? a date at least?
[1:46:12] goekenaitor: this is the players fault thought
[1:46:15] BBMezzy: I'm happy that's the lesson they're learning at least
[1:46:16] Thoreya: yeah kinda
[1:46:21] SlithTheSivak: its not like we're paying them monthly or anything..."surprises" feel like you are being stringed along
[1:46:25] goekenaitor: 'man I wish we would learn this outside of ptr'
[1:46:36] goekenaitor: devs: don't give ptr
[1:46:41] ImperfectDark: can't believe they posted that lol
[1:46:47] goekenaitor: players: *surprise pikachu face*
[1:46:47] NeeK_23: they started the hype and vague posting too early, if theyd not gone so hard so early it might have been ok
[1:47:06] SlithTheSivak: almost 7am
[1:47:06] ImperfectDark: oh i mean the Taliesin post
[1:47:08] KaisenSiru: 6:55AM
[1:47:11] Thoreya: lol
[1:47:19] Thoreya: wakes up and reads wow, sounds like Ion
[1:47:20] teh_villain: she jus woke up yeah ?
[1:47:23] dright424: I think all we really need is a date for the patch tbh
[1:47:32] Lausten: 6AM is very normal for people her age to wake up
[1:47:33] SinicalDev: I think they could at least be like "yo we're aiming for the 15th march, but we'll let you know if that changes" rather than just silence the whole time
[1:47:33] SlithTheSivak: they have core hours but some people start working early so they can go home early
[1:47:49] Harai_Ulfsark: or she's one of those people that go jogging at 5 AM

[1:49:02] Lausten: After seeing Preaches interviews and seeing that they had a TV with streams in the offices I always wondered if they lurk in wow streams im in..
[1:49:12] Harai_Ulfsark: im a GM for another game and i'm here almost everyday tho Kappa

[1:54:24] fichoo15: To open that cage
[1:54:26] MediumRareOG: i was only missing 2 achievements. it took me 40 minutes
[1:54:33] fichoo15: LUL LUL
[1:54:58] fichoo15: It drops a mail item and a sword tmog item tho
[1:55:25] Lausten: Season 3 gear sure makes it go faster, think I tried back in season 1
[1:56:01] Lausten: Like the damage you're doing to it now is insane compared to what I did in s1
[1:56:11] SinicalDev: 1k ilevel again by the end of TWW
[1:56:14] Lausten: The pre patch gear was 252
[1:56:36] Lausten: Some of my alts still have 252 gear at 70 LUL
[1:56:41] goekenaitor: 340ish i think was like level 70 gear
[1:56:47] CianoHD3: well a squish is happening in Midnight
[1:56:52] MediumRareOG: the numbers are already too high. ilvl, stats, damage
[1:57:08] goekenaitor: like if you were doing elites and stuff
[1:57:17] MediumRareOG: damage in the hundreds and a crit of 1k+ feels the best imho
[1:57:18] death_cam_: just dont jump the numbers too fast
[1:57:23] MachoCham: I thought they said level squish in Midnight and iLevel in TWW
[1:57:50] death_cam_: i can see 600 ilvl at 80 at start in TWW
[1:58:00] MediumRareOG: TWW ilvl at current pace will probably get to 800-900
[1:58:00] death_cam_: and dps having -2m ish hp
[1:58:32] LuiBMHunter: old age?
[1:58:37] death_cam_: season ilvl jumps are normally 26-39 ilvls
[1:58:45] CianoHD3: i dont think they confirmed how many levels they are giving for Midnight and TLT
[1:59:02] EazzyBreezzy: is there an addon which tells you what to do to 100% that particular expansion? i like the idea of doing that
[1:59:16] MediumRareOG: i completely avoided the maw in 9.0 because of tthe eye of the jailer. i LOLed when 9.1 removed it
[1:59:39] adampanerabread: I wonder if they'll remove any of the stamina increases that they gave us throughout dragonflight
[1:59:41] EazzyBreezzy: thank you!
[2:00:13] death_cam_: renown gave stamina?
[2:00:34] CianoHD3: they removed it at the start of Dragonflight and changed it to move speed
[2:00:37] Lausten: That was for SL wasnt it?
[2:00:38] adampanerabread: no, at the start of some patches they increased player HP and enemy dmg
[2:00:41] MediumRareOG: didn't SL renown also give stamina? what happened to that?

[2:04:32] adampanerabread: the main thing i got from that video is that he said "a couple weeks"
[2:04:47] SlithTheSivak: 19th
[2:04:50] Kubwa7: @mrgm you can get them by running even mythic +2, etc
[2:04:50] dwolf010: 2-4
[2:04:54] Lausten: You can get lucky, but honestly, how big is the entire M+ loot pool for hunters?
[2:04:55] CianoHD3: you might be able to actually i am unsure
[2:05:13] MachoCham: the /att WQ will show you any world quests that are up which you need rewards from
[2:05:23] Kubwa7: you can just join groups for that dungeon and farm it
[2:05:25] death_cam_: i need the polearm and that sword from the same dungeon
[2:05:26] Harai_Ulfsark: i got the polearm, but getting the plate parts and the sword been a nightmare
[2:05:54] death_cam_: should group up and spam 2s to trade each other the weapons lol

[2:08:11] MachoCham: Who was asking about a specific expansion - Can do /att TierID:9 for Shadowlands for example
[2:09:03] death_cam_: does killing 1 mythic 0 boss give vault for when doing it on alts? (been spamming last boss in DOTI for quantum tmogs) would be nice to save time spamming 2s for those mogs
[2:09:43] MachoCham: I feel like I should put this stuff in a discord channel KEKW
[2:10:40] Lausten: @death_cam_ Heroics, Timewalking and +2s give 441 reward in the vault. 1/4/8 dungeons needed for 1/2/3 rewards next wek
[2:10:55] Thoreya: no one was playing LUL
[2:11:08] Lausten: But the reward is random across the entire M+ pool @death_cam_

[2:14:51] Lausten: There is a few that requires special items and such
[2:15:05] Phenroi: There is one you can't do because you can't take the dmg on account of being overleveled
[2:15:22] MachoCham: Be interesting to see if they retrospectively add all the quest rewards for transmog for diff item classes
[2:15:27] MachoCham: Could be a big jump
[2:15:55] death_cam_: i found out a few weeks ago on the tournament realms you can actually transmog frostmourne with 2h weapons. would be nice for them to actually add a replica into the live servers
[2:16:14] BBMezzy: Do some ZM for anima? Or see if your alts have some to transfer?
[2:16:15] invictus_DK: I finally unlocked flying in shadowlands
[2:16:45] Lausten: Yeah ZM is the most reliable source for anima
[2:17:36] Lausten: It 100% felt like ZM was build for Dragonriding in mind
[2:17:51] Phenroi: I have to farm to many motes for the mounts in ZM lol. That is such a grind

[2:26:56] Lausten: Yeah they work from bank I believe
[2:27:07] dwolf010: you know what i just realised? that 10.2.6 event and trading post is made by the same experimental gameplay team. atleast if you look who talks about it

[2:29:39] thomssone: I wonder if they will add more mount collection achis for TWW so I can get back into grinding
[2:29:42] athrem01: For some material you need to go into raid as well
[2:29:55] overgrownpean: the lattices you can buy on the AH as well to save the time!
[2:30:06] garaton_mcguffin: vespoid lattices are pain!

[2:32:28] Septikknissen: Isn't the vespid one the most rare of them all?
[2:32:55] death_cam_: lowest drop chance
[2:32:56] Lausten: 0.5% drop or less
[2:32:57] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:33:00] garaton_mcguffin: yeah vespoid is worth the money, those things almost never drop
[2:33:07] Lausten: 10k is worth it
[2:33:15] athrem01: Yeah 0.5% is only the rare
[2:33:16] Harai_Ulfsark: i have a few of the vespid, almost sold them during shadowlands when i learned they're pretty rare

[2:39:14] Mergaam: wasnt there a rep buff that would change expansion every week? came back to retail so might have missed some news
[2:39:23] Lausten: You had a cutting error I would guess so you say the same thing after each other in the video

[2:41:38] MediumRareOG: can't wait to TWW prepatch and they extend chromie time to 70 and decrease the 60-70 xp
[2:41:45] dwolf010: I wonder if 10.2.6 launches with the timewalking event as s4 will start a few weeks after
[2:42:16] str4ysheep: i heard you pay him the same amount you pay yourself
[2:42:17] dwolf010: yeah but have had the TW event every end of season in DF
[2:42:31] MediumRareOG: i still think there'll be another xp boost event before TWW. could be timerunning. makes me think of TW
[2:42:59] Lausten: D4 had rep and xp right? Maybe HS will have that too?
[2:43:32] Lausten: Wasnt the D4 one added last moment?
[2:44:04] Lausten: I feel like they changed the name to something winds that was basically just a copy of the event we had back in SL or something..
[2:44:29] Harai_Ulfsark: winds of sanctuary
[2:44:46] Lausten: Right and Sanctuary was added very late if I recall correctly

[2:47:03] fooxytv: yes it's very expensive, I hope everything goes well!
[2:47:16] MediumRareOG: You still need to do the ZM achievemnt for ZM flying
[2:47:17] Harai_Ulfsark: nah, zereth mortis has its own flying achievement
[2:47:45] chelfx: You think we may only have a week or two of S4 Testing with 10.2.6 coming out so late

[2:48:57] wastedxtime93: I think this is the week for guarenteed Legos if you've killed HC every week
[2:49:20] Harai_Ulfsark: it also makes it harder if someone decides to nuke the boss before the criteria is met Kappa

[3:08:43] pvalue01: cant believe they wiped 400 times on that during RWF. clearly a trivial fight.
[3:09:06] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: A YTer discovered WOW cinematics and a hoard of us descended on him talking him into playing.  His mods created a guild but the hardest part is the split EU and NA.

[3:57:06] Taelson: doing other raids?
[3:57:27] Lausten: The TLP guy got his mount in the mail I saw
[3:57:42] Harper_n7: @Darkunh I still haven't gotten it since the change lmao
[3:57:57] ImperfectDark: @Darkunh wouldn't say really easy. I think it's still under 1%?
[3:58:00] Harper_n7: @Darkunh I'm nowhere near 8k attempts tho lol
[3:58:13] Harper_n7: @ImperfectDark I'm over 300 and still can't get it...
[3:58:16] MediumRareOG: it's 100% real. the austin employees were unionizing and they got laid off

[3:59:27] Darkunh: or 3 weeks with 50 alts with bonus roll
[4:00:34] funviking99: DinoDance
[4:00:41] Darkunh: remember to use bonus roll for MOP world bosses, then your alts counts twice, I did 8k attempts over like 7 years before that drop..I wish Blizzard fixed things sooner

[4:05:27] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: 1. Figure out if you like damage from distance or from whacking on things.  That'll influence what class you want to play.
[4:05:30] NeeK_23: if you start the group we can start summoning now
[4:05:44] bomayaa: there's so many ways to play the game that advice is impossible
[4:05:55] Jack_the_Dipper: And do not be afraid to ask for help from other players. Some may ignore but some can help
[4:05:55] hype4minisforehead: I'm a Orc/Hunter - Thought it would be fun
[4:06:04] death_cam_: wowhead made a post about the tweet and spicy comments as always
[4:06:13] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: You need bags? Which realm server?
[4:06:17] hasseksek: Hunter is a pretty good class to start with, that is if you want to be a bit safer

[4:13:29] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Betcha that race change is to test out the possibility of Tuskan as allied race.
[4:13:31] Lausten: Yeah Tuskars are not likely to become a playable race due to missing animations
[4:13:58] Lausten: But since they are not there already it seems they are not on the board at least
[4:15:01] Lausten: Would be so much fun playing as a tuskarr
[4:15:32] Shrandamar: Tuskarr for life
[4:15:54] hype4minisforehead: Do you get shadowlands with the Sub, I bought the new Dragon addition?
[4:16:08] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Chat, what interface is he using for the raid names?

[4:17:17] bojackhorseman2004: I actually got kicked once from a group when i asked for a summon xD
[4:17:43] bojackhorseman2004: I then whispered the group leader and he told me he dosnt wanna do keys with unfriendly people :(
[4:17:49] MediumRareOG: i can't imagine earning 500 honor levels
[4:18:10] bojackhorseman2004: well, they said "hello" and i said "can i have a summon?"
[4:18:20] adampanerabread: i saw someone the other day with honor level 1900
[4:18:23] JoshOTWO: it takes soooo long and was so ez in legion
[4:18:28] bojackhorseman2004: :(

[4:18:48] Jelky55: honor lvl
[4:18:49] death_cam_: its infinite
[4:18:55] chelfx: it doesnt stop
[4:18:59] death_cam_: there are community groups that farm 40 man bgs all day
[4:19:06] Jelky55: but there is no reason to go beyond 500 cuz thats the last mount reward
[4:19:09] funviking99: some people have thousands of honor levels
[4:19:12] Vidaloo: Infinite no? There's a CoD prestige levels-style system no?
[4:19:19] Lausten: 4118 is the highest
[4:19:37] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: That Jaina tour I took a mage.  We were grateful for the ports out to get to the new dungeons/raids.
[4:19:42] Jack_the_Dipper: I can see dead people
[4:19:42] Jelky55: i managed to grind 500 back in SL
[4:19:43] bojackhorseman2004: when you reach 100 honor you get to duel sylvanas Kappa
[4:19:44] Jelky55: from Legion
[4:19:44] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: We hit several places.
[4:19:49] bojackhorseman2004: honor level*
[4:20:00] Jelky55: Dan ill come, i got port
[4:20:06] Shrandamar: imagine moving your fingers
[4:20:13] Jelky55: why not
[4:20:44] Jelky55: i like to brag about my SL raid portals ( u get it if u do all bosses on mythic during Fated season xD)
[4:20:48] databob1: I'm so offended it offends me
[4:21:16] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: Standing at the entrance to ICC and having too much fun on Twitch so I forgot to do the run, lol!

[4:22:30] chelfx: all 3 on normal
[4:22:39] Jelky55: then hc for Hero of Fate title
[4:22:42] NeeK_23: all 3 on normal, all 3 heroic gave title, mythic gave portal

[4:23:44] dastago: castle nathria was easily the best thing about sl
[4:23:47] Knight_Of_Sarcasm: I feel like I'm taking up too much space in cities/towns Flux.
[4:24:24] Jelky55: i prolly wasnt here when u discussed it but what do u think about Holys answer about 10 2 6?
[4:24:34] MrEvilRex: @MrGM where is the current one, im looking
[4:24:42] bojackhorseman2004: I really dont get how we have the main boss, zoval and then denathrius a 1 tier boss. And the latter is way WAY! better of a character and villain
[4:24:43] MrEvilRex: roughly
[4:24:44] dastago: i used my switch so much at launch but i barely touch it now it's sad
