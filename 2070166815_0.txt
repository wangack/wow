[1:09:18] dogo_person: @cripples42069 Like Elon Musk ?

[1:09:21] oilyblackmouth: should be above 12% to survive the winter

[1:11:26] ry_rai_rye: “I’m just resting my eyes” — drowns
[1:11:29] cripples42069: @ama__deus normally from panic. most common mistaken is people try to fight the currents. I live on the India ocean. just last week someone from my community drowned
[1:11:50] ama__deus: @cripples42069 did they go far out or fairly close to the shore?
[1:12:22] HeinMuck: is that how swimming works?
[1:12:24] Sockentee: the water is also reducing your body temp. the longer you´re in there which also leads to exhaustion
[1:12:24] cripples42069: it was close to shore if I’m not mistaken. I wasn’t there but I believe it wasn’t far out

[3:02:10] Frayeen: Yea stv feels empty after they added layers
[3:02:25] elessar_jk2: i dunno i think they completely half-assed everything. better luck with classic+ i hope!
[3:02:51] Moejellini: Do you think you'll try the HC solo self found mode? @PsheroTV
[3:02:57] mejstroo: i think thats a normal thing, you enjoy something so much you want to share it with others.
[3:03:15] Moejellini: it is, comes out on the 29th
[3:03:16] Istunlocklocalpensioners: Get ready for Cataclysm! nadedDerp
[3:03:20] Moejellini: you can group for dungeons
[3:03:34] Moejellini: no
[3:03:46] elessar_jk2: @Istunlocklocalpensioners SoD made me hyped for cata and retail unironically haha
[3:03:51] slimeyguyx: hardcore is dead idk why they would push a solo self found after having a dedicated realm which people made + blizzards realms lol
[3:04:05] mejstroo: they made too many versions and too fast
[3:04:19] citricxy: any plans for irl stream some day ?
[3:04:21] Moejellini: I think they shoulda sat on HC for way longer it was popping off hard
[3:04:29] JonkoJoris: there just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks atm.

[3:04:43] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @JonkoJoris true
[3:04:51] Panic1811: I feel like they should have tried to experiment more with runes instead of just pulling from other expacs
[3:05:00] mejstroo: @Moejellini true, shouldve been cooking sod longer and let hc continue
[3:05:03] lilzenzay505: @slimeyguyx yeah so dead
[3:05:25] Teazlol: SoD HC is DOA if streamers still have contentl to do on SoD
[3:05:34] Moejellini: I do miss HC though it was so fun for a while
[3:05:36] ChrisarN: hello mr pshero
[3:06:13] mejstroo: yeah in al ayer with npcs
[3:06:19] JonkoJoris: to much layering is a problem
[3:06:25] squirtgunpumper: honestly wish they got rid of the boss mechanic make it so you cant group and raised the blood per kill
[3:06:41] Istunlocklocalpensioners: if that
[3:06:51] mejstroo: is this "solo self found"? KEKZ
[3:06:53] Istunlocklocalpensioners: and this realm is nearly full right?
[3:06:54] Moejellini: why havent any layers anyway im so sick of it
[3:06:55] Istunlocklocalpensioners: tf
[3:06:57] guni1980: But the lag is fixed :P
[3:07:09] Kirnc: it ruins wpvp and stream snipers.
[3:07:14] bigdubsss: well i noticed none of the events lagged today so maybe that there solution
[3:07:15] OozeSnoozeLose: it's not even layering, it's retail sharding but they won't admit it
[3:07:28] BigGainz: is it just crusader strike that has a bunch of layers? or all servers
[3:07:36] Frayeen: Tbh P2 feels like last week of P1 alrdy
[3:07:39] Panic1811: @OozeSnoozeLose I think a dev literally said its sharding with tape holding it up
[3:07:54] WcWillow: yo i think you ganked me (enh shaman) at the start of this stv xD ggs bro

[3:08:59] Frayeen: there's some spots where they will attack u actually
[3:09:13] BigGainz: why is ally the more popular race in sod? In classic it was horde by a lot no?
[3:09:35] Istunlocklocalpensioners: wow was great with no layering back in WOTLK
[3:10:01] Moejellini: classic is always alliance favored
[3:10:08] koboldich: Kapp
[3:10:10] BigGainz: ally is locked on like every sod server for the last week
[3:10:33] Moejellini: i meant in the past

Or simply to keep taxes low so that I can keep the power (money).   With money, you can buy labour. Which is pretty much paying them to do what you want. As the old saying is, everything has a price.

[6:18:56] RoryJumping: people with no money educating us how money works I cant even
[6:19:02] shurqutan: people are different
[6:19:08] elessar_jk2: point is, more money = better private healthcare, no debt, no struggle, own your own home/house, provide for your kids without struggling, etc... not more money = wow i can buy more lambos and im still depressed lmao
[6:19:14] Paramaum: yeah, if more money could make you happy why do we hear all these stories about multimillionaires celebrities comiting suicides all the time?? Losing meaning in their life and what not...
[6:19:14] cringepowerx: money can change a lot of things mate look at elon musk
[6:19:26] WonFiN: ooofff

[6:19:41] AnguishTM: @cringepowerx what about elon
[6:19:41] aegean98: money is great, but if you are a purposeless directionless idealess individual you will quickly realize apart from nice goodies and wordly stuff which get boring fast it does not do much for you. But ofcourse you can use it to generate exponential value if you utilize it properly
[6:19:46] julienb95: There's a mix frequency of both answers here

[6:20:29] MrYatahaze: b
[6:20:33] MrYatahaze: but lack of it really makes you sad
[6:20:36] bakerpls: i think the happiness to money ratio is pretty much bigger at the beginning ofc. but for someone that is struggling, a fair amount of money would grant alot of happnies to a point. after that it wouldnt make that much of a difference
[6:20:54] notbsn: i would be very happy if i could buy a home lol
[6:20:57] Kpaxlol: There probably is another threshhold you haven't reached yet.
[6:20:58] Bambooyah_: True, I know what he means. U need goals in life cause once you achieve x goal it becomes plain
[6:21:04] RoryJumping: once u can buy groceries without checking the price more money doesnt do much
[6:21:20] elessar_jk2: it buys you the tools for happiness (healthcare, own property, no debt) etc... these are huge stressors. i dont think anyone equates more money = yay i can buy a lambo now and still be depressed. thats just childish
[6:21:25] joeychrist315: “a lot” of money is so different for people.

[6:43:41] Qrucials: it depends what you would do with the money otherwise
[6:43:47] halfwaythug: they only let you pa a specific amount a year so you cant outsmart them
[6:43:50] pizac7: if you get a good rate though you're better off investing than paying down
[6:44:06] StreamElements: twitch.tv/psherotwo for variety
[6:44:10] cryshardcore: you can decide to pay it in 10 years yourself, no need to force yourself into it from the beginning
[6:44:28] AnthonySo1337: sometimes they wont let you pay it back faster depending on the type of loan LUL
[6:44:31] duckiezgo: yup! and the bank won’t stop you from paying it off
[6:44:39] zickiwow: if its like that sure
[6:44:41] seb127: interest rate on shorter terms is usually lower
[6:44:42] BlincAlex: how do you see enemy buffs on portrait?

[6:46:31] AnthonySo1337: Mortgage is a good example
[6:46:31] infinigen: It's the same in all banks because you break the contract
[6:46:44] duckiezgo: can you just buy a bunch of property like that Pshero? and rent it out for income
[6:46:47] AnthonySo1337: if you pay off your mortgage "instantly" you will usually break a clause and pay extra feees
[6:47:12] Bootch: monkaHmm ps researching sec chat
[6:47:24] LoboSoldier: monkaHmm
[6:47:55] duckiezgo: that’s still good Pshero I mean unless you can pay it off in one year
[6:47:58] seb127: lower interest rates on 15 yr vs 30 yr rates, but higher monthly principal so less cashflow @PsheroTV
[6:48:03] Bootch: so its doable FeelsGoodMan
[6:48:08] Bootch: unless monkaW
[6:48:40] duckiezgo: ahhh shit you need to get fixed if you’re playing the long game Pshero
[6:48:52] Bootch: monkaHmm so you dont want fixed but kinda do

[6:49:51] Bootch: struci peepoHug eyooo Strucifren heroL
[6:49:56] AnthonySo1337: the bigger picture is if your contract says you have to pay a fixed rate, youre "fixed" in it LUL
[6:49:59] duckiezgo: fixed for long game non fixed for short game
[6:50:03] Bootch: @struci widepeepoHappy
[6:50:14] joeychrist315: you always want it fixed.. if your going to pay it in less than a year then just buy it out lol
[6:50:20] Bootch: PepeLaugh
[6:50:38] struci: if I ever hear a banker talk about "sophisticated financial products" I want to throw up in their face
[6:50:48] infinigen: Before, when you pay the tax according to the contract, if you have conditionally distributed over 10 years, you are breaking the contract, so you pay extra
[6:51:18] joeychrist315: if you can pay it in 1 month then just buy whatever it is outright and don’t take a loan
[6:51:18] duckiezgo: yah because you save that 1% penalty right? that makes sense
[6:51:23] struci: financial advisor
[6:51:35] duckiezgo: financial advisors
[6:51:35] KussTV: you'll avoid refinancing fee's.  I have a 10/1 ARM and I need to refinance now in 7-8 years when the rates go low
[6:51:36] StreamElements: RULES: 1) No backseat gaming. I will do whatever I feel like doing. 2) Be nice.

[6:52:34] Panksie: Banks will always find a way to F you
[6:52:35] duckiezgo: my financial advisor gets money off my stocks and my rented out property. They know all this shit Pshero and break it down to you easier
[6:52:59] KussTV: they way they get you is the amortization schedule.  the first part of the loan your mortgage payments are mostly interest
[6:53:06] StreamElements: Did you guys know that you can connect your Amazon Prime with your Twitch account and get one free monthly Twitch Prime subscription? You can use it on your favorite streamer, or of course on me, Pshero. heroW (Please remember Twitch Prime doesn’t auto renew) heroL

[6:54:15] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @zickiwow then throw some holy water on yourself
[6:54:16] AnthonySo1337: Yeah zero % interest, except the insurance costs an extra 60 dollars more dont wonder why Kappa
[6:54:21] duckiezgo: it’s a fucking monopoly then buying a car in Bulgaria haha mandatory insurance through them
[6:54:30] emica223: turn on ur nameplates trust me, its easeier to see enemy coming
[6:54:34] joeychrist315: idk if that’s really fucking you because I wouldn’t give anyone a lump sum of money for a decent period of time without making anything off of it
[6:54:37] struci: I have one question YEP
[6:54:39] infinigen: If you have a loan divided conditionally for 10 years and you pay it in 5 years, in this case, from their point of view, you are violating the contract and are additionally fined for that. This is because they no longer receive a large percentage from you. All banks have a similar contract
[6:55:12] struci: @infinigen after 5 years most of the interest has already been paid
[6:55:22] struci: most banks will gladly let you go for free after 5
[6:55:27] duckiezgo: @joeychrist315 it’s called interest rates. majority of people don’t pay off their cars in 2 years
[6:55:28] Istunlocklocalpensioners: bruh learning about finance is so fuckin important man
[6:55:32] Istunlocklocalpensioners: business and finance
[6:55:34] Ambivan: Automod is so.... 😡
[6:55:39] Bootch: so they fine you bcs they cant steal your money
[6:55:40] Bootch: HUH
[6:55:41] bassiemon123: Another gnomer run letsgooo, hope to get my 3 set GoldPLZ
[6:55:48] struci: interest is front-biased for that reason
[6:55:57] struci: so it ends up not working like that KEKW
[6:55:59] iiMrBlue: you can pay a certain amount each year on top of what you are currently paying without penalty
[6:56:01] Bootch: hopefully you find a good guy
[6:56:07] AnthonySo1337: The banks have a certain net profit they will make from the loan, they dont want less than that in any way possible LUL
[6:56:18] struci: exactly
[6:56:19] Bootch: true FeelsMan
[6:56:24] duckiezgo: Pshero do you have property taxes in your country? that comes into play also
[6:56:26] pizac7: principal

[7:04:48] Gabrigha: hello Ps
[7:04:56] Istunlocklocalpensioners: the best thing is to be low maintenance tbh
[7:05:03] Istunlocklocalpensioners: if you don't need a lot of stuff it's good
[7:05:31] elessar_jk2: ps have u ever played RBGs?
[7:05:54] nailerak: @Istunlocklocalpensioners cast iron / carbon steel pans, good knife set & my hiking/climbing gear.
[7:05:54] struci: speculative real estate investing should be illegal, change my mind
[7:06:01] elessar_jk2: not your thing?
[7:06:07] duckiezgo: yah that’s me I own 5 properties and counting…. guilty as charged @persigno
[7:06:15] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @nailerak lol that's very low maintenance
[7:06:19] duckiezgo: it was it is its business
[7:06:20] xiondisc: Can't sleep Sadge
[7:06:34] nailerak: @Istunlocklocalpensioners also quite happy :)
[7:07:00] duckiezgo: @psherotv what about rent it out for profit
[7:07:10] satanic_pope: what's the bleed debuff @PsheroTV ?
[7:07:39] Gabrigha: Have you found a build of your liking yet?
[7:07:50] nailerak: but jokes aside, when you realize you've spent 4-5x more on gear than on clothes/frugal/vanity stuff, you're in a good position
[7:07:52] xiondisc: How would you audit people for something like that?
[7:08:07] struci: @persigno "twice the value"… interesting slip of the tongue
[7:08:17] elessar_jk2: man retail's mutilate sound is so perfect :D  sounds like actual carnage
[7:08:29] struci: @struci if you invest with 7% returns over 10 years you also double your money. don't have to wait 30 years
[7:08:32] xiondisc: If you already own a property, you can just change your address and still live at the other place.
[7:10:13] xiondisc: With something like that, it would eventually make renting property out unaffordable at a certain point.
[7:10:36] duckiezgo: my Family has 5 Pshero….. its majority of our income based on rent we make per month
[7:10:44] xiondisc: Or it would just increase rent across the board.
[7:10:59] nailerak: @xiondisc rent-seeking behavior is kinda parasitic anyway, so that's a good thing in my book
[7:11:06] StreamElements: Check your posture, you lovely person heroW
[7:11:32] struci: @persigno if you invest at 7% ARR you 8x your money in 30 years

[7:12:15] duckiezgo: which kinda screws me but what can ya do
[7:12:22] xiondisc: Tbh, I've never rented. Went from living with my dad and paying him 200 a month to not get kicked out, to owning a home, lol.
[7:13:05] letho_og: @xiondisc that's pretty good going from $200 to a homeowner

[12:04:16] Hufy0: @sportstud007 not sure if splitting evenly is a smart move, then everyone in raid slowly gets their epics to where youd all get them at the same time theoretically. Letting them just get rolled off and whoever gets it gets it, ensures some people can craft them sooner and then they wont roll on them anymore.

[12:16:05] Aztinoz: Dragon and squirrel can go together also since chicken does the most dmg
[12:16:20] Hufy0: you cant have the squirrel and chicken on same tank they hit too hard together, you need tank of whelp and squirrel with one tank soloing chicken.
[12:16:20] I3ardo: chicken does too much damage, need to solo tank him and put dragon and squirrel off
