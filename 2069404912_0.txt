[0:00:13] ren0m: Good morning
[0:00:23] ren0m: Just as I was done watching yesterday's vod
[0:00:42] ymivan62: hello
[0:01:43] ren0m: Now that you're home alone, you can do some PvP if keys situation is bad.
[0:03:06] ren0m: Can you get over 490?
[0:04:22] rindioh: fyrakk has been taken out back tbh
[0:04:30] Guffels: hey man. I finally killed smolderon. 277 pulls
[0:04:56] Guffels: then got promptly g-kicked lol.
[0:05:05] simplyhebi: druid raid? you havent gotten your heroic trinkets yet either?
[0:05:20] simplyhebi: Its 3 months in and im still doing heroic fyrakk, feels like ass
[0:05:21] Guffels: "performance" not saying im good but im like a 50 parser

[0:05:43] Guffels: disc elarning from the best kek
[0:06:24] CyonDru: gm gm
[0:06:27] CyonDru: damn druid raid today??
[0:06:32] simplyhebi: healing parses bit of a meme regardless
[0:06:56] Guffels: yeah and I haven't had a chance to ask about what they considered. was gunna write something up today. i know i was no #2 healer in deaths on smolderon but the #1 was the raid lead so...
[0:08:24] Guffels: yeah its not easy so I get it. plenty of time to find another group
[0:08:50] ren0m: But he did play in the first RWF, right?
[0:09:10] try_weii: seems like raid leading tank would be ideal
[0:09:15] simplyhebi: @Guffels btw sorry to hear you got gkicked man that sucks ass
[0:09:25] Guffels: i loved raid leading aotc as tank. was very fun
[0:09:49] try_weii: lol good point
[0:09:49] Guffels: but we were a 10 man so very easy to manage
[0:10:00] rindioh: atm I'd say hunter is the best role to RL from
[0:10:00] sw0ngs: @try_weii raid leading tank during progress is extrememly tough
[0:10:15] simplyhebi: lmao
[0:10:42] try_weii: @sw0ngs cuase of vantage like jb is saying?
[0:10:51] EggsDaddyLongLegs: my servers went down D:
[0:10:58] maenkins: excited to start getting chances at raid loot this week?
[0:11:14] Guffels: plus who doesnt love watching firedup play lol. the man is a robot
[0:11:35] sw0ngs: @try_weii also because you are still learning a lot of the fight
[0:11:57] Guffels: oh but yeah I didnt realize how much of a wall smolderon is. we gained world rank after proging for 5 weeks which was wild to me

[0:13:32] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:14:21] try_weii: what did the review say
[0:14:29] ren0m: @kelly_mac06 how much?
[0:15:46] devilhawk83: adeentHuh Bolstering in DHT sucks hard especially the first pull with the bears when they gets bolstered @kelly_mac06
[0:16:00] simplyhebi: I noticed you have invigorate. is it for something specific to AD?
[0:16:23] ren0m: Which microphone do you have?
[0:16:35] simplyhebi: makes sense
[0:17:11] squirebdd: Isn't 13% a bit low for the keys you're pushing?
[0:17:18] Lewsea: You were looking at that MSI OLED, no? @jdotb
[0:17:23] try_weii: that is interesting, i need to learn what oled means
[0:17:49] simplyhebi: @squirebdd it depends on the key sort of. avoidance doesnt affect much in AD
[0:18:00] Whitewolf1441: eu can play but na cant :(
[0:18:01] squirebdd: @simplyhebi Ah, I see
[0:18:04] Lewsea: Mm - I'm looking at that DWF Alienware
[0:18:21] simplyhebi: @simplyhebi like it doesnt affect soulrend for whatever reason
[0:18:30] sw0ngs: @try_weii organic LED
[0:18:49] dragona92: LED = light emitting diode KEKW
[0:19:15] NeuroTheGamer: thought m+ was canceled this week??
[0:19:17] Whitewolf1441: lmao organic??
[0:19:28] sw0ngs: @Whitewolf1441 lol yes for real
[0:19:28] The_Mail_Man__: oled's don't need a backlight so they can turn individual pixels off
[0:19:42] The_Mail_Man__: makes black colors in games or movies really dark
[0:20:12] Whitewolf1441: i just think its weird that a "god" is being kept as a pet, anyone else agree?

[0:20:49] Whitewolf1441: yeah but why is he in a zoo
[0:20:53] dragona92: So Yazma or the forces she plays with - controls Rezan's body
[0:20:54] Whitewolf1441: look at where he lives :(
[0:21:02] Whitewolf1441: @dragona92 ahh ok
[0:22:35] simplyhebi: why is fort bolstering still not outlawed man
[0:22:50] Whitewolf1441: @simplyhebi maybe next mdi
[0:23:01] Whitewolf1441: thats when they remember to fix m+
[0:23:02] simplyhebi: inshallah
[0:23:07] Whitewolf1441: in sha allah
[0:23:28] treavorthenusance: @simplyhebi had a dht earlier where the the shadowbolt dudes in the tree at the end had a shadowbolt hit the tank for 2mil LOL
[0:23:29] devilhawk83: adeentHuh Blizzard probably thinks Bolstering is the most fun affix @simplyhebi
[0:23:52] simplyhebi: @simplyhebi mercy
[0:24:14] Whitewolf1441: theory: blizzard things affxies keeps people interested and engages because it  shakes up keys and not the same thing each time
[0:24:21] simplyhebi: @devilhawk83 its funny cause its gone through several different iterations now and still hasnt landed on something people are happy with
[0:24:30] Guffels: safe kekw
[0:24:55] treavorthenusance: @simplyhebi the affixes could literally drive to peoples house and give the 5 bucks and a blowjob and they'd complain it wasnt 2 bj's tbh
[0:25:15] dragona92: @treavorthenusance Fax

[0:26:21] lanta404: if you love it why would it be the wrong decision
[0:26:45] Kawatteruwow: @YoSaax_ yes
[0:28:04] sw0ngs: @YoSaax_ pres pretty good if you have a group that helps around you by being aware of your shitty ass short range

[0:47:05] frazlord: tf was that mil payout?
[0:47:14] frazlord: All 30 carry or something?
[0:47:14] moki_3: that was boost?
[0:47:32] frazlord: That's nuts lol
[0:47:56] moki_3: who was booste?
[0:48:02] Lara_TV_: Ok I need to start boosting high keys wtf

[0:48:50] seacombe: if you cant tell whos being boosted in a 30 then they probably dont need to be paying
[0:48:58] Lewsea: based
[0:48:59] Orgabism: Looking at the damage, the dh
[0:49:06] Conzo_Live: Hey Jb, quick little question here. Would you rather have knee's for fingers or every time you see someone in the street you vomit bullets (55 to be exact)(safely).
[0:49:33] frazlord: @seacombe they're just paying for the group, not a carry
[0:49:46] seacombe: yeah fair

[0:51:02] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[0:54:22] try_weii: are you a political animal jb or not interested or like to keep that stuff private?
[0:54:43] Dissperia: do you find the boosts yourself or through an agency? weekly 20's dont seem worth it, but the higher keys seem alright pay
[0:55:33] Kokka0: Kokka0 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Can't wait to see you back in MDIs !
[0:55:47] Raggu2: perhaps dissuading the boosting communities played a part in the xrealm gold change.
[0:56:13] Sokchoy: whats the lore behind the no lust melee cleave comps on TotT
[0:56:30] try_weii: very similar to hawala networks in modern money laundering
[0:57:35] YoSaax_: is it 100% ban rate buying gold?
[0:57:39] Galois_rg: unless the leader is drogo, then drogo gets more than everyone else
[0:58:37] Lara_TV_: still get a similar amount of raid buff value too, with monk+warr on all phys dam
[0:58:49] Guffels: i assume rogue can also cloak the debuff on 3?
[0:59:15] Raggu2: Spell reflect feels like cheating in there

[1:16:02] Wiigglles: omg this is what ive been looking for
[1:16:12] Raggu2: yea, your target staying on screen is default iirc.

[1:30:04] Guffels: oh lol this is his video XD
[1:32:35] Whitewolf1441: "not very good" xD
[1:33:29] WytherOK: bro his pacing 💀
[1:34:20] Guffels: This isn't new though. Healing is balanced around tools and every class and infinite tools now with the new talent trees. Hero talents will exacerbate the issue, not resolve it.
[1:34:57] Exogenesis9: Ineffable truth Hpal. Always in CDs.
[1:34:58] Lara_TV_: Yeah he somewhat mentions removing CDs/increasing the cooldown time
[1:37:11] WytherOK: I prefer maintenance healing vs CD management
[1:39:45] Spritesgud: its especially noticeable on hpaladin right now. Imagine healing a group with just holy shock and holy light, it would take a year to top everyone up
[1:40:45] treavorthenusance: its wierd how the iconic class spells do nothing in m+. like heal, rejuv, holy light are never ever used
[1:42:46] sukoWoW: they should have shrunk the talent trees instead of adding more onto them
[1:42:54] sw0ngs: can you image mage players without all their defensives, they are gonna cry sooo ahrd haha
[1:43:31] Lara_TV_: I've been put off from getting into healing again because of the current state of things
[1:43:35] Lara_TV_: would be nice if they did something about it
[1:43:37] treavorthenusance: honestly i know people like the talent trees or w/e but the old system from mists - sl i kinda preferred lol
[1:44:31] Defused1976: healing the 20 rise yesterday… every dps with mobs bolstered 10 times. what’s a defensive??? then the poor dh took every frontal there was in rise to bolstered mobs :( how can I save him when it’s a 1 shot mech at that time.
[1:44:33] RayeAerinae: it also makes pug keys miserable when dps press 0 defensives
[1:44:50] RayeAerinae: this is why keys sit waiting for healers for 30 minutes
[1:44:53] RayeAerinae: no one wants to deal with that
[1:44:59] Lara_TV_: I think the talent trees are getting the flak for it when it's really just what they contain. They can definitely replace those CDs with consistent value passives/procs and still keep the good side of the trees.

[1:46:45] Mythos24: Someone needs to clip this.  This is golden, all DPS needs to hear this
[1:46:50] Xevenna: What is your thoughts on healers not being able to dispel certain things?  Healers job solely is to heal and theres stuff they still can't remove because its spread out between different classes. I feel this attributes to the "meta".
[1:47:12] Liftos: feels like the DPS's are in charge of not dying and the healer is responsible for top them before the next burst
[1:47:15] Exogenesis9: First time I really noticed that was when Soulrend hit 1 shot territory.
[1:47:17] treavorthenusance: @Xevenna this sucks so bad like wcm on druid or eb on priest
[1:47:37] Xevenna: wcm is trash for pres if people arent kicking properly.
[1:47:45] RayeAerinae: there's zero comparison between a 20 with people pressing defensives and the other where they're not
[1:48:02] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[1:48:32] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:49:19] yenny__: hearing about the healing spreadsheets the RWF people use is fcking insane
[1:49:20] Exogenesis9: @Fortvila Not really? I mean eventually you get to the point where you know which things you have to defensive, and what you can't send defensives on because you'd run out.
[1:49:30] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: !wa
[1:49:30] StreamElements: all my weakauras https://wago.io/p/jdotb
[1:50:20] YANYOoo: give the power back to the healers!!!!
[1:50:26] yenny__: i fcking love my ret pally
[1:50:29] yenny__: evil healer man
[1:50:30] Guffels: as long as you do it on an expansion launch people will cope
[1:50:51] Exogenesis9: Ret's just sitting there with 3 defensives. It's mostly taking advantage of massive passive defensive creep.
[1:50:51] Raggu2: Right now, damage is so high and so random you have like half a second to use a cd anyway or you might get randomly shot and die.
[1:51:03] Fortvila: As a dps that pugs most m+, i love it when healers are kinda useless, cause in 80% of the keys healer is the weakest link
[1:51:29] treavorthenusance: Too many people have io we gotta lay them off. bolstering everyweek /s
[1:51:42] bleeppblorpp: @Fortvila great take kid
[1:52:04] healapotamus: spriests have to take their kick and dispersion in the shadow side of the tree. bet if they made other classes choose defensives or throughput that would help
[1:52:20] Raggu2: Everyone gets warrior defensives.
[1:52:26] Raggu2: cackle
[1:52:29] easymeld: what if u had fix amount of money on world, your story not works then
[1:52:43] ren0m: As someone who returned to wow in DF after +10 years, I was shocked to see how tanky tanks are. They just don't die.
[1:53:01] ren0m: It seems like a tank could solo dungeons, although it would take him hours.
[1:53:06] Lara_TV_: I'm working on my own game and that is still something I'm pondering. I like the idea of having the dedicated healer role.
[1:53:28] Lewsea: Will the response to healer balance then to give them more control over instantly topping health bars? That has a whole different type of problem that WoW devs wanted to get away from @jdotb
[1:53:31] YANYOoo: dropped a lot of truth bombs there
[1:53:37] ren0m: @Lara_TV_ how about "support" roles
[1:53:46] Twin029: i started wow in legion, so i dont really have a huge past experience, but even in legion healing tanks in M+ was harder
[1:54:02] athemick: I think it's fine if tanks have agenda about their HP/self healing, but yeah def CD's need to toned down. It's same issue in PVP to kill someone you have to get through 5-6 def CD's
[1:54:51] athemick: Every spec need just 1-2 def CD max, and healers maybe 1 external
[1:55:16] pokemongonicolai: nerf MW monk back to unplayable pls :)
[1:55:33] lanta404: if you showed a vanilla wow player how tanky a modern mage is nowadays they would shit their pants
[1:56:34] Lewsea: I feel like this goes back to the wildly differen things different trees are able to get. Why the fuck does mage just get to have all their keystone talents???? Compare to Priest who gets close to no defensive value at all
[1:57:35] Mattyuh: raid has become kind of dull and just choreographed
[1:57:48] Obeez: especially when doing damage as a healer becomes increasingly needed
[1:57:50] easymeld: TRUE THAT SUX
[1:58:05] treavorthenusance: m+ healing used to be able to carry a group. now your just along for the ride outside of maybe eb and fall
[1:58:23] sneakyflamingo: Was blizzard expecting healers to take on a "shot calling" role except for personals and group drs? or maybe they just didnt realize the impact of adding so many of them
[1:58:48] Lewsea: OH BABY I REMEMBER THESE STREAMS

[1:59:42] dragona92: BFA times FeelsStrongMan
[2:00:10] dragona92: 3rd boss was the healing challenge, this one was like - there's a high chance of one shot or spell reflects
[2:00:15] stylee__: casting reju so oldschool xd

[2:00:54] moitchster: ho god
[2:01:12] whiskeyhide: shout out trance

[2:01:31] easymeld: press cd
[2:01:43] caradea_: i remember this
[2:01:47] caradea_: loved and hated that boss
[2:02:04] stylee__: it was so good to soak 20+ stacks here as a healer i felt strong xd
[2:02:12] moitchster: bfa was horible also on siege
[2:02:56] treavorthenusance: thats more rejuv's in 1 minute than you use in like 3 dungeons now lol

[2:03:29] ren0m: Did keys back then go as high as they do today? (+30s)
[2:03:45] arxi0: ngl kinda loved 3rd boss halls of infusion on high tyra for a healing challenge similar its just a shame the season was godcomp trash
[2:03:49] treavorthenusance: yea its not 100 or 0 lol
[2:03:58] easymeld: less oneshot mechs
[2:03:59] lanta404: feels more like a dance
[2:04:07] 100torkel: they need to bring that back
[2:04:12] Wiigglles: @jdotb what would u say is the best mechanically designed m+ boss?
[2:04:23] moitchster: ye its not like now
[2:04:46] pokemongonicolai: i like shadowlands giga dmg healer, shaman with vespertotem was very fun :p
[2:05:01] Dissperia: and look at the damage you are doing, hardly anything like traditional healing
[2:05:10] Raggu2: hots work well with the self healing tanks i think too.
[2:05:12] Dissperia: more emphasis on the healing than damage

[2:05:53] treavorthenusance: xxx hot and heavy healing comin your way in the wwi
[2:06:23] Lara_TV_: BASED
[2:06:41] Zircons: BASED
[2:06:42] Obeez: great take, i agree
[2:06:43] Dissperia: thats why i stopped playing healer a long time ago, i enjoyed the healing, not the damage
[2:06:46] Wiigglles: but catweaving <3
[2:06:47] silkysmoothnick: BASED
[2:06:49] lucashowmuchpain: D: but i love playing dps with extra steps as my role
[2:06:49] ottomr1990: a hot but correct take
[2:06:55] CyonDru: I think min maxing damage is fun and shows some level of skill but I agree. make us heal more
[2:07:02] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:07:03] moitchster: agrried
[2:07:08] Wiigglles: i like choice dpsing but not full dpsing
[2:07:23] Wiigglles: and not having to minx mac that dmg
[2:07:24] pokemongonicolai: healing all the time is boring i always played healer and would not be okay with healing all the time it sounds boring
[2:07:31] Wiigglles: just doin it to help a lil and fill the free time
[2:07:32] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:07:43] stylee__: yes but healing rot dmg is more fun than one shots
[2:08:17] lanta404: i main dps and i hate the idea of having to dps 100% of the time
[2:08:54] devillad666: it’s sounds boring to play your role HUH
[2:08:55] Nonyamuff: J . MUTHAFUCIN' B sup
[2:09:00] moitchster: i hated when i was forced to dps when my role is healing if i have to heal loads in sertion places if u know what i meen
[2:09:22] Wiigglles: i dno considering timing keys always comes down to dps
[2:09:26] Wiigglles: and pulls
[2:09:27] Lewsea: Atal is such a ride - second boss so cool. third boss can fuck right off
[2:09:33] Lewsea: ^Sorry EB
[2:09:36] Wiigglles: it feels like as a healer u will always need to do sp somewhere
[2:09:42] Wiigglles: *dps
[2:09:45] Zircons: right now if you feel like you get to do a lot of healing it just leads into one shots because of defensive creep
[2:09:47] treavorthenusance: 25 and above council boss in eb is probably the best healing fight this season IMO
[2:11:03] moitchster: kill grevius i hated that afix
[2:11:24] gelth: ironically the goal is always to avoid trash that causes unavoidable damage
[2:11:25] Wiigglles: i percieve us doing a little dps occasionally as dps/tanks having to utilise externals to help keep ppl alive
[2:11:40] gelth: routes go around abominations in EB for example, bc it's unavoidable dam
[2:11:53] gelth: you pull stuff that's dodgeable/kickable damage instead
[2:12:10] Zircons: healer dps also feels weirdly weak right now
[2:12:41] 초콜릿니키: as it should be
[2:12:50] Dissperia: it would be an interesting challenge how to make healers heal more rather than dps without the group constantly dying. I think the current problem is people getting 1shot rather than rot damage which healers can't do anything about if they are not pressing defensives
[2:12:53] moitchster: lags ><
[2:12:54] arxi0: perfectly fine with healer dps feeling weak imo
[2:12:55] zebracak35: @Zircons Rdruid is pretty strong
[2:13:18] ren0m: How much of your dmg was the trinket?
[2:14:03] 초콜릿니키: rdruid dps is not like S2 hpal level but it's okay
[2:18:57] 10000watts: p good song
[2:18:57] lilkittykat24: why run convoke over tree form?
[2:20:58] lilkittykat24: i see - thanks
[2:21:22] Wiigglles: @jdotb do u run mass root in rise?
[2:21:40] obe_one: What lvl of keys need completed to reach 3k io?
[2:22:12] dragona92: 20s, I think
[2:22:15] selerf: all 22s, some 23s

[2:25:39] ren0m: Does it even make sense to check M+ logs if you're 2500-ish rated? I suppose those numbers aren't very accurate.
[2:26:01] ren0m: If you're doing a good job.
[2:26:02] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:26:12] caradea_: key % rankings are for the specific key level
[2:26:15] caradea_: if thats what you mean
[2:26:29] caradea_: yeah its not really comparable
[2:26:32] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:27:03] i_cassius: Is fort and bolstering as bad as it sounds ?
[2:27:06] ren0m: Besides completing a key, you don't really know if you're doing a good job, that's why I ask.
[2:27:09] Lewsea: comps have a much bigger impact on m+
[2:28:01] caradea_: just be honest to yourself and figure out what you could have done better
[2:28:23] yeat18: hey
[2:28:29] yeat18: can u show your m+ talents?
[2:29:03] ren0m: I guess I should be more worried about that when I reach higher lvl. I can't really compare my druid with you.
[2:29:11] ren0m: Since you're 3.8k
[2:29:17] mz1465: What do you think about frost mage? I am unable to top the dps by the ned of a dungeon
[2:29:27] ren0m: Ah
[2:29:46] caradea_: @ren0m but you can. see how he treats certain pulls vs what you do
[2:30:11] ren0m: Ok but as a healer, if someone dies you then have to figure out if it was your fault.
[2:30:26] ren0m: And in lower keys, there's a 50/50 that it was either you or DPS not pressing buttons
[2:30:30] Wiigglles: do u find invigorate is actually good?
[2:30:34] xGuiha: when to run tree and when to run convoke?
[2:30:46] caradea_: @ren0m if you log it, you can see what defensives they had available, and if you healed them enough prior to the damage event
[2:31:00] caradea_: its what i did a lot
[2:31:42] ren0m: @caradea_ I might start doing that
[2:32:28] ren0m: That's the thing. I might've done everything I know, but I might also be playing bad.
[2:33:02] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[2:33:21] Wiigglles: i had a situation earlier with the AOE dragon in rise and the evoker died but like he has LB and hots and i had to regrowth the other dps or they would die to
[2:33:28] Wiigglles: and i was dry of cooldowns and externals
[2:33:31] Wiigglles: so like what do i do
[2:33:39] Wiigglles: i dont have the gcds
[2:33:41] Wiigglles: to do more
[2:34:40] caradea_: @ren0m sometimes its a "whatever" situation and you just gotta go again^^
[2:35:24] xGuiha: @jdotb thoughts on tree vs convoke?

[2:37:59] Lewsea: Birthday drunk m+ stream? jdotbPoggers

[2:48:44] Lewsea: oracle can rot in hell
[2:49:02] Dissperia: bin aug, spread more of the support style out to other healers and give all healers universal BL so you can do more 5man team comps imo
[2:49:18] SevzyYEP: They seem miserable to me.  I dunno why they're doing this, just adds to the balancing nightmare and doesn't really add a whole lot
[2:50:08] SevzyYEP: Systems YEP
[2:50:29] Dissperia: i am glad there is no definitive must have team comp this season for m+ at least
[2:50:51] Dissperia: tanks could do with a bit better balancing but thats about it
[2:51:09] timmayb166: are you on eu realms?
[2:51:53] Frostfury: Lets see how many leggo will drop after the recent buff
[2:52:49] kelly_mac06: that blp buff was insane, my guild got 5 leggos last night with less than 20 ppl in raid
[2:52:51] hipposlam: i have 23 bad luck tokens so far and it still didnt drop yesterday
[2:53:16] Frostfury: @kelly_mac06 That is insane, I just got mine before the buff happened
[2:53:52] kelly_mac06: @kelly_mac06 i was shocked to see so many, but happy for our strength users. sadly we still have 5 more who haven't looted it yet
[2:54:23] caradea_: saw 5 of them drop earlier in a pug raid with 30 ppl aswell
[2:54:38] Guffels: i have always been on the downer train for the new talent tree, i always assume it was going to be impossible to balance and most of the choices would be fake
[2:54:42] kelly_mac06: @caradea_ ye i guy know saw 7 in a 30 man heroic pug lol
[2:54:52] kelly_mac06: they increased the shit out of that drop rate lol
[2:55:15] caradea_: as they should imo
[2:55:21] kelly_mac06: @caradea_ agreeed
[2:55:40] Frostfury: Of course they will increase it since season is done soon
[2:55:51] kelly_mac06: i feel very much that they should have had like a bar that was visible to players so you could see if fill up as you looted the blp
[2:57:33] caradea_: i wonder what they'll do about that next season
[2:57:43] Guffels: we have a couple people who did their lockout before the increase who are very pissed off
[2:57:43] caradea_: probably just make it buyable through tokens
[2:58:05] Frostfury: @caradea_ Or an item to increase the item level
[2:58:08] Guffels: idk why everything isnt just a frostmourne style quest. collect shards from killing bosses on the personal loot table
[2:58:21] Guffels: atleast then its easily visible luck
[2:58:42] Guffels: and it would reward people who do mythic with faster aquisition
[2:58:57] BigPatty123: afternoon jb
[2:59:06] kelly_mac06: @Guffels but the buff was part of the tuesday/wednesday maintenance
[2:59:09] caradea_: @Frostfury yeah but that'll be not useful for people who can only loot it once every 3 weeks in a fated raid
[2:59:13] kelly_mac06: they just didn't put out the blue post
[2:59:34] kelly_mac06: unless they made the decision randomly to do it half way through the day yesterday
[2:59:56] kelly_mac06: @Guffels agreeeeeeee
[2:59:58] Guffels: i saw a 20 mythic group with no drops at reset yesterday so i think it was the second one
[2:59:59] Raekhorr: ez prog
[3:00:18] JimmyBeardSlam: im just glad to see our guild isnt the only one fucking up heroic fyrakk
