[2:00:53] mayonaes: they said it was further along than we think though
[2:00:55] 91Niki: Gfuel has a good mix between vitamins and caffeine. It doesn't keep me awake for 24h. Just a solid small energy boost
[2:01:07] igamexhype: I would much rather WoW let us know ahead of time that this expansion is going to take longer than OW2 release.
[2:01:14] ninetysix: the announcement made me quit valorant to go back to wow lol
[2:01:24] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: Dragonflight is probably gonna release q2 2023
[2:01:52] xluckydawgx: xluckydawgx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Morning Yall

[2:02:07] pushnoir: why did they bait us with the talent trees of 2 classes and then 0 word. Sucks for any non druid or DK
[2:02:24] Lasidor: April? That seems a bit long doesnt it? I would think they push the holidays for sales.
[2:02:34] igamexhype: is it on schedule? I thought xpac was 2 years not 3.
[2:02:39] actually_pierce: how is that bait? they're just giving examples of what you can expect the new trees to be. they're most likely not even finished yet
[2:02:57] Velashen: Shadowlands felt like a draught through most of the expansion, makes this wait feel worse.
[2:03:13] ninetysix: i wonder if a rogue can run garrote and gouge in sub with the talent tree
[2:03:30] pushnoir: @actually_pierce because why do you release something for 2 classes when its not ready for the others
[2:03:37] igamexhype: WoTLK is going to be a nice addition.
[2:03:47] magemaster225: do you think if it was going to be out in the next 12 months it would have been at the XBox show?
[2:03:51] Kedemel: I'm hype for WoTLK.
[2:04:07] Wayward_Son_: I love watching DK tank

[2:10:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's crazy with GDKP now
[2:10:03] ninetysix: @Towelliee i think they should do mini exp like each 4 months a mini exp it will be good 1 raid 4 dungeons
[2:10:04] N3llee: 7-8 multiplied by 30
[2:10:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: those bots gonna be hard at work on those fresh realms, gold will sell at a premium for awhile there

[2:10:34] Brodih_: if you are a healer or a tank, gdkp is amazing to make gold since you can join even if youre not a buyer

[2:11:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's a lot of shady shit, because it is hard to make gold in TBC
[2:11:16] club420: they need to just merge the fresh servers if they start to get low pop
[2:11:24] Prayshock: I just want to find a nice 10-man raiding guild and go casual one day a week
[2:11:30] Brodih_: but the downside of GDKP is that it  promotes gold buying
[2:11:34] Lasidor: With Wrath I bet you see it go down simply due to 10 man stuff
[2:11:36] Gingerprimer: @club420 they have announcned they are merging tons of dead servers

[2:43:06] Gingerprimer: Boomkin tree looked so nice +hoping we get semi revert of boomkin back to legion
[2:43:07] thebakeriscomingforu: those talent trees are going to need some serious work before launch.
[2:43:29] Gingerprimer: The ones they showed of were fine
[2:43:39] George2001k: I want trees that I can click!
[2:44:05] MyRandomName: yeah, way too many actives there, especially the baseline spells there, spending points on that, and bridge passives to get to things you want, basically yes needs work
[2:44:20] Gingerprimer: TBF 99% of ppl will just ctrl+c and ctrl v their talents
[2:44:21] DragonofWolves: I still remember when I got a Shadowlands alpha invite. I had no clue WoW subs even got access to it. Thought it was only F&F

[2:46:10] amricatt: I would love a couple of release dates and I'd be really happy.
[2:46:14] George2001k: @towelliee think that PoE style talent trees can work with WoW?
[2:46:14] Metket: you are saying they are relaxed but the other day you said they are also afraid of after the actual acquisition happens right?
[2:47:30] Dankind64: LOL every time i see POE trees i quit playing. diablo 3 was perfect for my simple brain
[2:47:31] Mecabeast: clash Royale was like that you'd plataue on ladder until you ranked up your cards
[2:47:36] thebakeriscomingforu: the real question is after 17 years do we need talents trees in wow anymore?
[2:47:41] George2001k: That shit looks so complicated but I do think it can be fun
[2:47:41] Ghostpuddlez: good morning peeps
[2:48:01] Gingerprimer: @George2001k prob not since POE trees are kind of cimpilcated and wow needs to appeal to a bigger player base

[2:48:09] noosphear: MS acquired Activision/Blizzard for the devs.  The people who will probably see transition are corporate functions (HR, marketing, etc).
[2:48:28] Gingerprimer: @DUCKF00TT it is 3 month base fresh
[2:48:33] Kellorian: Ding!
[2:48:33] Devil301: I'd be a fan of blizz dev teams getting new blood under microsoft.

[3:00:46] Gingerprimer: @fatbat8 yes easily doable
[3:00:50] thebakeriscomingforu: With any acquisition it depends on what the buyer values. With Microsoft it would likely be the IP that Blizz/Activision have. Microsoft has no trouble getting experienced devs.
