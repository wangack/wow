[2:46:28] Copyright4850: poor gamon he was only doing it to feed his two younger brothers. he's taken care of them since his mother and fathers passing 4 years ago. It's been rough and he have had to do some stuff he wasn't proud of. In desperate times we do desperate things i think executing him was a bad move. show him mercy instead and help a brother out.

[3:44:53] m4gnify: @Lvl14Wizard so the faster one is better in mainhand, since it has higher dps
[3:44:54] archlams: @quensa @JakenbakeLIVE it does matter, off hand damage is reduced so that dagger in main hand will net you more damage overall
[3:45:00] bluum2: @rayf95 why? he seems to be killing pretty quickly with no downtime
[3:45:09] Heinrike: @JakenbakeLIVE do you get classic addons through the twitch app or curseforge?

[3:45:25] IAmAudio: Wait, so you want faster weapon in off hand? I'm new to wow
[3:45:30] ScumClassic: @jakenbakelive With those weapons the fast weapon should be in your mainhand. Your first thought was correct.
[3:45:31] MapleMecha: the fast one is better MH since offhand dmg penalty

[4:28:32] Sindalax: @Katatsuki End game has so much content tbh, 30/40-60 is kind of a drag I agree
[4:28:33] Frommen: The tale of dickneck
[4:28:35] Drameon: @23beeh in retail you can buy gold for real money and you can get better gear for gold but wouldn't call it p2w cause you can better gear than that really easily and other than that gold doesnt do anything. classic is not p2w at all

[4:29:28] Firelord_Redflames: no :)
[4:29:31] Sindalax: @babygorillaa it's like a headstart you can buy sort of. You buy gear on the auction house but it's not the best. To get the best you actually have to play
[4:29:31] nohi_: @GeorgeTheBoss1996 this applies to mostly all mmorpgs

[4:35:21] xsaaav: @Sindalax I thought people wanted vanilla back because the current wow is too easy and sandboxy and hoding your hand. If you are using addons to add those quality of life stuff back, then why not play current wow?

[4:36:10] Sindalax: @xsaaav In my opinion addons dont really detract any experience from vanilla, as there were addons back then too
[4:36:13] Pr0gzy_: People dont like current wow cos you can do everything solo and no need to communicate to anyone except for raids and mythic plus
[4:36:17] nohi_: up skirt Kreygasm
[4:36:23] Sindalax: @xsaaav And vanilla is definitely more sandboxy than the current expansion

[4:36:55] Chenpokomon: TriHard 7
[4:37:03] Rafe_L: @xsaaav i dont play retail but the main complaint i've heard is that getting gear improvements is just layers upon layers of RNG, back in classic items weren't azerite modifiable or whatever and the drop rates were way lower so the reward feeling was much higher
