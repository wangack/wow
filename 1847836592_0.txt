[5:18:48] PKGOD: Let’s be brutally honest, a more casually friendly mode like solo shuffle doesn’t need a cap when it’s original design was meant to help new players ease into arena.
[5:19:04] Skourgh: i dont care half as much for the MMR as i do for the Solo shuffle que times, sittin there at 40 minutes between a match, if i get 5 plays 8 hours pass by quinWTFF
