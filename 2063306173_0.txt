[3:19:38] dramatikdave: can you show talents sec pls
[3:19:41] Ieo19: @Ziqoftw  There are several spawn points in the graveyard where the elites can spawn, basically anywhere you see a SINGLE undead rather than a group, an elite has a chance to spawn there.  To get them to spawn, simply kill every isolated undead mob, you can leave the groups of wanderers. These mobs will respawn every 10-15 minutes, and it appears that every respawn has about a 5% chance of being one of the rare elites.  From what I can tell, after either Ironspine or the Fallen Champion spaw
[3:19:45] Azkafan: stop saying u need to do so much and run in raids and spend golds bro

[3:44:41] fetza108: i love the fact i was upper level than Ziqo before he casted AWC. After the casting he pushed and he is max leveld and a lot more geared than me. Abosuletly GIGACHAD and I am payoOld
[3:44:42] EggLar: it scales with the damage u take
[3:44:46] Dedo_jaha: not worth
[3:44:49] Releaserage: try vs boomie KEKW
[3:44:52] Azkafan: @Ziqoftw coupled with chrono heal u have 3 life bar bro
[3:45:00] tomramsden: This sounds ass.
[3:45:01] Azkafan: LOOL
[3:45:01] GuesswhoLoneWolf: when are you playing with pshero and payo in tournament @ziqoftw ?
[3:45:04] Enbex: KEKZ
[3:45:16] Nik0Lion: let a rogue mutilate u 3 times then press it
[3:45:23] marvinmc420: @Ziqoftw Get a weak aura for the temporal beacon cd
[3:45:23] Azkafan: its good vs hunters for chimera tbh
[3:45:27] tomramsden: So you gotta have beacon up it's got a massive CD and heals less than chrono pres :p
[3:45:30] Dreschnuu: let a melee hunter connect u for 1sec
[3:45:32] 7osei: i think the fact you need to have beacon makes it kinda clunky
[3:45:43] Azkafan: yea the beacon sucks
[3:45:51] SnotBoogey: @tomramsden it can heal more. it depends how much damage you took in the last 5 seconds
[3:46:00] Enbex: KEKZ
[3:46:01] Azkafan: ROFL
[3:46:04] Enbex: Pog
[3:46:06] Azkafan: SEE
[3:46:09] marvinmc420: KEKW
[3:46:09] Azkafan: double chrono heal
[3:46:09] Enbex: its the SWD counter bro trust me
[3:46:11] Azkafan: u have 3 life bro
[3:46:13] Azkafan: ur almost a cat
[3:46:34] whysoferal: dmg is above healing in this phase
[3:46:46] Azkafan: LMAO
[3:46:50] Enbex: EZ Clap
[3:46:50] fetza108: who is Zevi, char? sorry if it is a noob question but i see Ziqo is palyin a lot with him/her.
[3:46:51] Azkafan: u cant die
[3:46:55] Enbex: Brick LIzard
[3:46:58] tomramsden: Ah okay. Pretty cool then. Can you take damage while not beaconed, then beacon and rewind?
[3:47:03] Enbex: brickacelli
[3:47:07] Azkafan: yessss
[3:47:08] Azkafan: or hunters
[3:47:10] Azkafan: chimera shot
[3:47:11] SnotBoogey: @tomramsden no you have to predict the dam
[3:47:18] SnotBoogey: but 30 sec buff so
[3:47:36] SnotBoogey: you put it on befor eany fight and use it when you take big dam
[3:47:40] mewwanqt: Just do 1 tick of regen to get the 30 sec buff and just heal the big burst
[3:47:41] Azkafan: buffa?
[3:47:42] Enbex: huh
[3:47:43] weyachi: it is insane
[3:47:46] Azkafan: like a little buffalo
[3:47:50] xbann_tv: kekw
[3:47:51] enigmasvea: brickbuild
[3:47:52] Hawksworthers: "-3G to goblino" build
[3:47:52] Stars69: name pending
[3:48:23] Stars69: workshopping name ideas: target dummy
[3:48:28] tomramsden: Where pshero when you need him
[3:48:29] Azkafan: HAHAHHAA
[3:48:45] Azkafan: more disgusting than bloodzin in legion
[3:48:47] Azkafan: jeuss
[3:48:53] Azkafan: jesus
[3:48:54] strange_lives: my rogue is basicly 2 shotting all mages =P
[3:48:55] cancer69420911: rogue's opener doesn't mean anything with that rune
[3:49:00] Habibi4life: u need to try this tech
[3:49:07] SnotBoogey: @Ziqoftw living flame-living bomb -cone rogue and just waiti in iceblock or kite and watch them rot works pretty well too.
[3:49:10] 7osei: Giving a mage a good heal, what could go wrong Kappa
[3:49:12] Seronem0: shadow?
[3:49:15] Tras_1337: I would blast you with fire mage
[3:49:30] badillwwjoe: switch glove to living bomb after combat?
[3:49:47] nohne: rewind time, its like alter time? can it be dispelled?
[3:49:58] Azkafan: its a spell not a buff
[3:49:59] positive_ions: Isn't a lot of phase 2 cloth lacking stam? sadge
[3:50:06] st0neh: Heal sniper
[3:50:17] SnotBoogey: @nohne no its not a buff. the temporal beacon is a buff tho.
[3:50:38] Enbex: this song sounds like squidward walking
[3:50:42] st0neh: You're just about to die then in comes the Ziqo heal from narnia
[3:51:25] Grravity: fireballs hurt
[3:51:25] nohne: ahh ye, so u can only rewind time with beacon on
[3:51:26] Toolt: dirty
[3:51:36] booddhi: does he need to have the beacon on the entire time?
[3:51:56] Tras_1337: You cannot have arcane blast with this
[3:51:57] Azkafan: u dont like having heals turned in settings?
[3:52:04] SnotBoogey: @nohne exactly. and for it to heal you have to have been taking damage in the last 5 seconds whiel heaving beacon on.
[3:52:14] Enbex: KEKZ
[3:52:20] milk_mug: What's the missiles rune?
[3:52:30] st0neh: The setting randomly disables @Azkafan
[3:52:34] Azkafan: ohh
[3:52:45] Enbex: holy shit KEKZ
[3:52:48] enigmasvea: living flame heal got nerfed ya
[3:52:51] Enbex: hahahaha
[3:52:58] Tras_1337: They nerfed the healing on living flame
[3:53:06] felstavd: Rogues have to use a cd for living flame otherwise they die
[3:53:15] metalism: what about the arcane 1 shot build xD
[3:53:16] st0nemonkey: if you reapply chrono buff healing with rewind time is trash unless it’s been on you for 5s
[3:53:17] felstavd: Like either sprint or some shit
[3:53:34] SnotBoogey: @Ziqoftw with iceblock you can cone+ living flame. just watch them die in iceblock. especially with living bomb aswell.
[3:53:41] SnotBoogey: so its pretty OP vs them
[3:53:43] Tras_1337: Dual pshero
[3:53:45] dauwg89: why do you take missile barrage?
[3:54:02] Ivory_Fitz: Does the temporal healing buff have to be on you for the damage to have been recorded?
[3:54:10] SnotBoogey: @Ivory_Fitz yes
[3:54:12] felstavd: @ziqoftw can you counter a priest and melee hunter? They will get nerfed prolly but as it now
[3:54:12] Azkafan: @Ziqoftw im not even sure if u cant use it while silenced
[3:54:16] Azkafan: like imp cs
[3:54:43] Soul_Linked: OMEGALUL
[3:54:49] MetaErland: no guards there
[3:54:52] Enbex: KEKZ
[3:54:58] bahoui: paid guards
[3:55:05] Azkafan: yeaa
[3:55:08] st0neh: Stay near the guard up the hill
[3:55:09] Azkafan: it doesnt have mana cost so
[3:55:13] felstavd: Is there even guards in ratshit
[3:55:14] Azkafan: it might aswell have specific interactions
[3:55:34] Azkafan: SwiftRage guards ! SwiftRage at me !
[3:56:04] Vir0n: can beacon be dispelled?
[3:56:18] Azkafan: yeaa
[3:56:27] Azkafan: i had a feeling but now that u say i
[3:56:28] Azkafan: it*
[3:56:39] kromjsi: is Shadowpriest broken rn?
[3:56:58] kromjsi: bomy no kick
[3:57:06] SnotBoogey: @kromjsi ye cus shadow word death is broken now. does way too much dam
[3:57:17] st0neh: You could instant heal a starsurge crit I guess
[3:57:17] stehfann: no kick, but might have a war stomp
[3:57:18] Dedo_jaha: maybe time it with death .... they insta crit for 1k
[3:57:20] kromjsi: really? i thought SP dots were broken o.O? @SnotBoogey
[3:57:26] ndras: huricane, bear stun
[3:57:32] SnotBoogey: nah the dots are fine.
[3:57:35] lion_the_ryan: arcane blast range sucks
[3:57:45] SnotBoogey: just SW:D is hitting like 50% of everyones HP bars
[3:57:49] kromjsi: so if they nerf SWD on priest then MAGE is broken? :O
[3:58:04] metalism: probably
[3:58:05] lion_the_ryan: a smart one will, but shhh
[3:58:19] SnotBoogey: well arcane surge is arguably a bit broken. but thats a 3 min CD.
[3:58:19] Azkafan: i wasnt able to arcane blast in p1 but i heard starsurge range got nerfed
[3:58:21] st0neh: Smart boomkin Kappa
[3:58:23] Azkafan: but it seems its 36yard so
[3:58:30] mattygisme: L36m instants
[3:58:46] SnotBoogey: @Ziqoftw i was talking to @kromjsi
[3:59:06] Azkafan: well arcane with arcane talent gives u imp cs + grenade vs druid u can maybe win
[3:59:08] Azkafan: oh ye fuck

[4:01:14] Azkafan: whats the wpvp - stv spec tho
[4:01:26] johhan42: i agree people are not testing  w8ing for  streamers to tell them or  wowhead.. which is ridicoulus how u do not  want to explore the  game u play
[4:01:26] TheGamingBoar: overal strongest class is the lag in STV for sure
[4:01:45] lunkano: Ziqo, can you give me some insight into the competitiveness of horde racials in pvp in wotlk and cata? I ask since you are an overall pvp god :)

[4:02:48] kcm92: I am trying to do a druid restokin build using insect swam along with balance talents.

[8:03:05] lion_the_ryan: that's not true, there was one az earlier, but he had legs and no neck
[8:03:12] thebookeu: its from all rare spawn locations in gy
[8:03:18] DjPyro: his wand is pretty good pre mage quest
[8:03:20] Zodish: well damn
[8:03:30] skrutscher: those rares in GY have a crazy low spawnrate, i feel like
[8:03:30] thebookeu: you can jsut kill those mobs and in 5min or so its chance for rare spawn to spawn there. works until you get rare spawn
[8:03:32] thebookeu: https://prnt.sc/pa3nai
[8:03:42] wellrath: why do you want him? the neck?
[8:03:44] durkadurka3: owever, there is another way to cause them to respawn. There are several spawn points in the graveyard where the elites can spawn, basically anywhere you see a SINGLE undead rather than a group, an elite has a chance to spawn there.  To get them to spawn, simply kill every isolated undead mob, you can leave the groups of wanderers. These mobs will respawn every 10-15 minutes, and it appears that every respawn has about a 5% chance of being one of the rare elites.

[8:23:34] craftermain: 100 time r1 cant play perfectly first time? ApuShrug
[8:23:39] EffinsTV: Honestly, the game is too old and the options too limited. It's not like POE.
[8:23:59] COMMEdesRATS: poggers
[8:24:04] Hotssoo: @Zhadix you know u have insta spells and fast casts also right?
[8:24:05] Steveleeb: mass regen should just give a 30 sec beacon, 15 too shorty
[8:24:05] EffinsTV: So that's why there is not much variation in terms of spec
[8:24:22] danztah: @danielbanks you can buy ab food/water bandage and its cheap af

[8:24:55] Zhadix: @Hotssoo im talking about mage. What instaspells are u talking about other than pom?
[8:24:56] Creesu: options are limited by end talents not because its old lol
[8:25:08] QwQGolden: these's fuckin shit takes can we get an AD my boy Idc
[8:25:24] Hotssoo: @Zhadix I thought you where talking about healers in general.mb then i missread then ;)
[8:25:32] Zhadix: @Hotssoo np
[8:25:48] Steveleeb: The problem with no living flame and single regen is your 1v1 ability goes down pretty hard
[8:26:11] Hotssoo: @Zhadix the mage healer type for pvp i think will be glasscanon healer :P
[8:26:23] dramajohns: I was playing frost the last couple of days, and now im thinking arcane might be better for group pvp.  I found myself using chrono alot and not much dmg.
[8:26:24] danielbanks: I feel frost is too slow for the burst and instant damage
[8:26:24] tsahrapour: what about fire?
[8:26:25] SuaSponte: yeah i like frost, i even run ice lance, fingers of frost and brain freeze
[8:26:37] QwQGolden: ziqoJAM ziqoJAM ziqoJAM

[8:26:54] VNNI: spec*
[8:27:01] spbelky: arcane mage is fun deleting ppl in open world every 3 minutes, and for healing PVE. but kinda dogwater outside that
[8:27:03] Jayceza: beastie boys go hard
[8:27:19] spbelky: mage has no pushback prevention or instant cast heals, so PVP healing is kind of a dumpster
[8:27:31] Zevioi: I've been using the frost pvp with the heals its kinda nice
[8:27:32] danielbanks: I like this experimenting
[8:27:51] joestopfarmingshako: Most healers I've q'd with complain everyone dies to fast to heal effectively since everyone does so much dam
[8:28:06] jallaballan: maybe frostchaneling reduce mana cost on healing?
[8:28:07] hotmanpop: the best spell they added
[8:28:18] shykuar: lizardPls
[8:28:29] spbelky: 3 minutes of ads o boy
[8:29:03] voidzyxd: its only party
[8:29:07] jallaballan: so you get 6% more healing and 15% less mana cost from frost + all the cc
[8:29:10] grecko_: mass regen is grp wide
[8:29:27] Bushido288: Making new builds like goblins make new rockets
[8:29:28] crownhs: Gotta sort your raid frame by 5man
[8:29:33] Zodish: almost 3k viewers again - not too shabby ^^

[8:30:06] hotmanpop: spriest nerf are gonna feel so good when they hit
[8:30:14] lion_the_ryan: this is also with 30% battleground damage reduction too right lol
[8:30:21] ghazban1: god STV event is so fucking trash as warrior
[8:30:30] Korvynah: @lion_the_ryan no its stamina buff not damage reduction
