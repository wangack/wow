[0:21:57] Nightbot: Dali is not interested in playing hardcore now or in the future. He does not enjoy leveling or playing the game extremely cautiously. Yes, it's better to stream HC right now. No, Dali does not care.

[0:27:00] spihana: And a shadowmourne for the holy pallies too
[0:27:30] Murloc_Investigator: wotlk is also the one version of the game so far where its easy to start gearing new alts. No attunes, dungeon finder......I played 7 different classes / spec for a while this time around and I would have loved to have time to try out the others
[0:27:30] cAdams10: True. Classic era is good because you run all the raids still

[1:56:21] Kapers_: There is a difference between tipping a waiter, they make like 2-3$ an hour, and tipping others who make way more

[3:16:41] Nightbot: is salvdali supposed to be a play on Salvador Dalí? nice name if so. legendary artist of our times, if only his opinion was nice. world buffs are a plague on the game. after some research i seen he was in <Onslaught> so that explains enough about him. just another warrior in classic who wishes he was ahlaundoh. see you guys in fresh

[3:19:20] R_GraM_: like hilla
[3:19:30] Azathoth__: Pilla is a dwarf, shes a miner for sure
[3:19:31] xznips: leveling m inning is prob way faster at 60
[3:19:59] Azathoth__: Pilla mining/enchanter. Dalvsali herbing/alchemy
[3:20:11] R_GraM_: yea with epic mount n gear against world pvp lvl 60 faster
[3:20:21] Niksen_99: Isnt mining really bad compared to herbing
[3:20:23] xznips: btw def do all the elite quests in redridge they are nuts
[3:20:43] Azathoth__: @Niksen_99 with dual-box, you can have both (and still 2 more professions)
[3:21:13] xznips: massive xp compared to everything else
[3:21:18] bacconader: Whats going on raidwise this week?
[3:21:41] Azathoth__: Can mine the arcane crystals for your own Paladin Epic Mount 4Head
[3:21:56] Azathoth__: Pilla needs to be the miner, shes the Dwarf Madge
[3:22:21] Azathoth__: No mining racial, just RP
[3:22:22] Drpopcorn: not a thing
[3:22:38] HeliosCirce: sorry, best we can do it a glove enchant
[3:22:43] Drpopcorn: yeh - dwarves should've gotten blacksmithing or mining
[3:22:59] Niksen_99: Its cozy KEKW

[3:24:04] veryrealx: is this wotlk?
[3:24:05] Niksen_99: Would you mind if blizzard removed weapon skill from the game
[3:24:18] HeliosCirce: westfall quests are the highlight of lvling for me

[3:25:20] HeliosCirce: I wish you great rng for the sunfish
[3:25:33] cloudstrife543: 21 is too high for darkshore
[3:25:38] Drpopcorn: @HeliosCirce hated how much alliance questing path bounces you around; Goldshire > half of westfall > long ass run to darkshore > back to westfall > redridge
[3:25:47] Pinsvin1010: You would have to do some grey quests for sure to open up darkshore but yea, just chillin in redridge seems good tho
[3:25:56] torquedupgaming: travel on horde is soooo much better too. so much walking as alliance
[3:26:09] HeliosCirce: @Drpopcorn yeah it isnt intuitive at all unless you got a decent guide to follow
[3:26:16] Azathoth__: But Barrens is the size of like 4 zones alone tho LUL
[3:26:21] Niksen_99: lil bit of ashenvale then hillsbrad right
[3:26:44] Azathoth__: Barrens may be one zone, but it has multiple quest hubs
[3:26:47] Drpopcorn: @HeliosCirce maybe i'm just jaded from playing alliance in vanilla actual when guides didnt exist yet and having no idea where to go
[3:26:52] cloudstrife543: depends which race, but alliance is just strart zone, next start zone, then darkshore/westfall then RR/duskwood
[3:27:35] Niksen_99: The area in 1k needles right above Gadgetzan is great

[3:29:22] Pinsvin1010: You've to do the chain no?
[3:29:28] HeliosCirce: There isnt a lvl requirement that I know of
[3:29:33] bacconader: na you need the quest right?
[3:29:39] HeliosCirce: just need it to be cleansed for you
[3:29:47] Pinsvin1010: Ehmm, worth a try honestly
[3:30:06] HeliosCirce: I never did the quest for like a year because id just get summoned to a cleansed flower
[3:30:07] Pinsvin1010: On era when it spawns it's already cleansed the first min for some reason xd
[3:30:16] R_GraM_: songflower wud b big at this level

[3:34:05] primecloth: pally's dont have NS so gonna need FOL
[3:34:08] amazadin: but FoL is better than HL...
[3:34:41] amazadin: illumination is god tier. its for all your heals. FoL, HL, and HS if you talent it
[3:34:51] ekiprkl: holy light is super duper inefficient

[3:35:14] peonprime: can't snipe heals with hol
[3:35:15] Toxiferous: correct
[3:35:18] HeliosCirce: yes holy light is the highest HPS
[3:35:31] amazadin: the only time you really ever should cast HL is when you are cancel casting. in raids, 5 mans, or even outdoor questing stuff
[3:35:59] HeliosCirce: in p6 I could spam r2 flash of light on the tank while gaining mana
[3:36:23] Azathoth__: Chat, it's time to start the PILLA RAID BRIGADE
[3:36:47] Toxiferous: howy white
[3:36:51] HeliosCirce: the only bad thing is that you can only cast like 4 holy lights before you exhaust your mana bar if you dont crit

[3:38:46] Morris_ranchett: world pvp poggers
[3:38:51] HeliosCirce: As a holy pally main in vanilla you cant really compete to well for throughput vs priests nor druids in some situations
[3:39:12] HeliosCirce: However, they perform well on logs because they are BiS heal snipers
[3:39:15] Toxiferous: can buy the mats off the ah

[3:43:47] Tbird65: think you missed some sparkles on pilla
[3:44:14] HeliosCirce: but if you wanna be honest, the real reason for bringing a pally is for bop so your casters can go ham on trash pulls with no regard for threat (for 10 seconds)
[3:45:10] Balruk_: max rank is 10s
[3:45:19] Azathoth__: But BoP doesnt use potion CD 4Head
[3:45:42] HeliosCirce: And once you use bop to save someone you get to bless yourself back your buff
[3:45:47] Balruk_: i think so
[3:45:47] TheDanishLurker: YEP
