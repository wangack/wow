[1:14:37] Keyastaron_: @towelliee I got my 10 kills did you get yours? blizzard said to log into oribos before next week
[1:14:58] protocoretv: I hope they allow you to craft cosmetics for the dragon riding
[1:15:37] Artful_Dodger: I wonder if Blizz will remove BoE raid drops and have crafting replace them.
[1:16:05] elrawin: They called the Tauren mining instructor Minertaur. That is more gold from blizzard
[1:16:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: @Artful_Dodger I think raid BoE's are always going to drop, so they can sell them to pay for their consumables
[1:16:36] Keyastaron_: yea they said you gotta log in to the character in oribos to get em fixed
[1:16:42] PvtHudson093: Some specs dont have a best secondary stat like Ret which changes what secondary is good based on what piece of gear you equip
[1:17:35] PvtHudson093: My Guildie got 2 BoE'S in one drop
[1:17:59] TheItalianStallion321: someone in my guild received 3 BoE's in 1 normal run
[1:18:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: 290 sounds pretty good, this fast, yeah
[1:19:17] tebbix: yeah people in m+ gets too crazy lol

[1:20:40] dimofodi: cheapest 304 is 900k, ring
[1:20:47] PvtHudson093: they did some hotfixes to M+ but I dont think it was enough
[1:21:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah those are reagents you add to the craft
[1:21:29] dimofodi: no no my server sorry
[1:21:41] NEMERL: @PvtHudson093 Depo and Kara are still overtuned
[1:21:47] Artful_Dodger: I think crafted gear can go up to 429 with the best reagents.

[1:23:30] Keyastaron_: anyone wanna carry me through mythic CN? LUL is it easy haha
[1:24:31] Jack_the_Dipper: It can be done but a lot of work. But that aint a lot fo gold at to be fair
[1:24:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: The daily callings, weekly quests, mission table stuff
[1:24:54] Jack_the_Dipper: Leanr the market and before you know it 20 mins a day can make ya a easy 50k-200k
[1:25:09] Jack_the_Dipper: But you need to leanr the market
[1:25:17] Jack_the_Dipper: And you will need TSM
[1:25:23] Jack_the_Dipper: Yeah of course :D
[1:25:32] Jack_the_Dipper: It needs to stay fun
[1:25:32] Deku_Scrub0: doing transmog/mount runs on multiple characters a week will net ya a decent amount of gold a week too and it fairly easy
[1:25:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure, there is a lot of gold flying through the auction house every day
[1:26:02] Jack_the_Dipper: I was flipping in 20+ servers and yeah that made some huge gold
[1:26:13] Jack_the_Dipper: But you do miss out on the game
[1:26:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Even just making bags can be some alright gold
[1:26:23] PvtHudson093: 10 characters running mission table all week should earn a nice amount
[1:26:30] Sarocus: And once you hit exalted with a covenant faction, each point of rep will be worth about 35s, thanks to paragon chests. That adds up quickly, even if it might not look like it
[1:27:34] Artful_Dodger: i346 should be what drops from normal lvl 70 dungeons.

[1:34:01] Retpally9329: And Preach didn't even get one till there was outcry
[1:34:19] Jack_the_Dipper: The ones that have authoririty Kappa
[1:34:36] wertywaz: @Retpally9329 Nah, there wasn't really an outcry. Shit there was more outcry over Hogger's model than Preach not getting alpha KEKW
[1:34:39] EKS90_: yeah that is also true, preach didnt get an invite untill people complained about it.
[1:34:50] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL
[1:34:51] coldhandsbeatz: They need to do a huge wave to regular people. Maybe in beta more than alpha. Beta access for just a week with twitch drops would be cool
[1:35:09] wertywaz: Nah, Preach got alpha after talking to Blizz directly, not because people complained

[1:36:22] EKS90_: @Rudric_Ice either you play to much then, or you are just not interested anymore. cause it was pretty fun running the fated raid and stuff. IMO

[1:37:22] vidgalves: what kind of stuff does jewel crafting gets you in dragonflight?
[1:37:25] FragmentalTV: the amount of streamers i see playing alpha, just fucks around with nonsense and complaining about bugs but NEVER EVER report the bugs etc is so annoying. literally don't care about anything else then getting viewers. makes me mad.
[1:37:27] Kelticlore: Kind of like how people would use PVP gear after hitting max a while back just so they could get into Dungeons or LFR
[1:37:31] xziyn: A Chinese guild has logs on M Denathrius
[1:37:50] Keyastaron_: @rudric_ice you get a currency to upgrade the loot

[1:43:42] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Bugs are there to be exploited LOL
[1:43:47] wertywaz: @Towelliee last season, keystone hero (the rating one) gave max conduits. Does this season's give any rewards?
[1:43:51] EKS90_: DF seems way more down to earth and more of a "restart" than legion did.
[1:43:56] NA_Mus: Will DF bring back Farm 2.0 I got to till my farm Kappa
[1:43:57] nightwolf_87: class halls estc
[1:43:59] nightwolf_87: etc*
[1:43:59] wertywaz: Legion was the first m+ remember
[1:44:03] Rabiahtaro132: Do you think I would have to change my Dracthyrs name, if I name it Dragonballz
[1:44:05] ArcaneMaki: Awww Legion <3
[1:44:06] chipmunkings: on the next exciting episode, the audience still has no idea what the plot, story, and lore of dragonflight is, the mists were lowered again and we become a dragon rider, but could ride dragons all along
[1:44:11] mavericks312: you put legion grinds in DF and players will complain your forcing them to play against there will
[1:44:33] EKS90_: I might actually play alts again LUL
[1:44:38] TheItalianStallion321: i started leveling my warrior again.
[1:44:39] Mitune: pvp races are a huge time waster in themselves as well
[1:44:45] userrx: is there WQ on DF
[1:44:45] Mecabeast: can't wait for the warrior tree discussion on Max's stream tonight cause prot is looking fun
[1:44:45] wertywaz: There is also a question about how much of the optional content people will do
[1:44:45] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[1:44:54] Gingerprimer: Yeah their hope is that the gameplay will be the thing that keeps players around
[1:44:56] Wholechin: how does warrior look so far?
[1:44:56] Gingerprimer: like MOP
[1:45:11] Gingerprimer: @Wholechin prot is gigachad
[1:45:28] Kyrrua: but gameplays boring tho, its all aboit transmog and mounts Kappa
[1:45:31] wertywaz: Like I think more people have done mythic Sepulcher than have finished the Ember Court
[1:45:49] GamertagTIKI: don't feel like different builds are a thing anymore...people just go to their fav streamer or wow head and see what's the best...and they just run that
[1:45:52] EKS90_: maw of souls lenght?
[1:45:56] pavepawns: this and maw
[1:45:58] ttvlevelis: shorter then Maw?
[1:46:02] mavericks312: shorter then mists?
[1:46:02] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  maw of souls ?
[1:46:02] Dohvrakk: shorter than maw?
[1:46:09] Kelticlore: I forget which ones is Ragefire Chasm
[1:46:22] EKS90_: cause maw is damn short.
[1:46:23] Kelticlore: is that the one in Org
[1:46:23] SnusnuHere: Did dragon roar change its area of effect size?
[1:46:25] PigPenLen: Got my Hammer Squad wife beater in the mail yesterday! towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:46:28] wertywaz: @Kelticlore the one under org
[1:46:32] Rabiahtaro132: How short did we want the dungeon? Yes.
[1:47:27] mayonaes: warrior looking juicy for DF
[1:47:57] senincraft: Hello there ! I'm a artist rendering players characters in my art style , sent ya an email with some examples, tell me if you're interested !
[1:47:58] EKS90_: @mayonaes Mained a paladin since vanilla, but changed to warrior mid SL, gonna continue maining the warrior in DF for sure.
[1:48:26] SilverFox_Gaming: Is it sad I look every day to see if I got an alpha invite
[1:49:16] Tharia: lol I do the same though I know better
[1:50:05] mayonaes: hell ya
[1:50:08] mayonaes: more crit
[1:50:10] Armdel: more dam
[1:50:13] nightwolf_87: why no slots in gear !! T_T
[1:50:41] Kelticlore: no cares for warriors
[1:50:46] Armdel: i almost expected them not do update alpha this week to keep focus on S4
[1:51:22] griffdog125: bad thing with the season 4 now is people want ya to be 3+ s3 to get into +5s lol

[1:51:46] dldrzoidberg: alot of people care about warriors. they are the orginal chad tank.
[1:52:06] Unitsven: Does dps war still have ignore pain?
[1:52:08] thebakeriscomingforu: Right now Warrior and Guardian look great
[1:52:22] wertywaz: @Kelticlore well if you look at the response to the talent calculator threads on /r/wow that's arguable given that there's like no comments in that thread compared to the other classes released
[1:53:01] mayonaes: These little fire elementals are going to be fun on mythic+
[1:53:37] CanHasGaming: Getting to have war machine is dope
[1:53:54] Etsku: dh warrior
[1:54:00] DeanoTV: LUL
[1:54:06] wertywaz: Also gotta love that they're going back to Legion spell reflect where the spell DR stays even if you reflect a spell
[1:54:09] Wholechin: evoker tauren
[1:54:35] wertywaz: every class is secretly evoker, some are just very locked to their visages
[1:54:42] SnusnuHere: Double jump then charge
[1:54:43] EKS90_: wanna try a full bleed arms build but no alpha LUL would be cool to see how it performes in this early stages.
[1:54:46] Breakthecause: It would be cool if double jump was standard for all characters
[1:54:57] PeaceThroughWar: Are these normals?  This stuff is so undertuned?  Lol
[1:55:18] EKS90_: Think its just undertuned to test it.
[1:55:28] mayonaes: heroic but they have decent gear
[1:55:48] Chompsy: Even if you stand in everything a druid hot would take care of it probably
[1:55:50] mayonaes: and prob undertuned
[1:56:12] ventu105: they only give access to alpha to streamers so they stream it
[1:56:16] Deku_Scrub0: do you like the new dungeons? how are they in comparison to the past 3 expansions?
[1:56:46] Orthobullet: OMEGALUL

[1:56:54] mayonaes: you did insane damage
[1:56:58] Thoreya: warrior is cracked
[1:57:00] EKS90_: spreading rend = muuucho dmg
[1:57:05] EKS90_: I guess LUL
[1:57:28] dldrzoidberg: about time prot gets good again. prot is resident sleep in shadowlands.
[1:57:34] ventu105: lol
[1:57:40] mayonaes: dude on bosses your shield slam was hitting for 40k
[1:57:44] Jack_the_Dipper: 'NetEase and Blizzard couldn't agree on financial terms, so the project is dead. The World of Warcraft mobile game expected to launch later this year has apparently been canceled.'
[1:57:46] Thoreya: @dldrzoidberg they might be best tank in s4
[1:57:48] Jack_the_Dipper: Is that old news?
[1:57:50] SamULJackson: surely the logs arent correct moon2CL
[1:57:55] iRumm: Warrior numbers gonna get cut in half
[1:57:56] Tirony: nice worryors gonna be sick
[1:57:57] iRumm: that's silly
[1:57:57] ventu105: @dldrzoidberg is awesome and the dps spec of warrior?
[1:58:01] Tatuatul: Prot warr top dps spec <3

[1:58:32] mayonaes: keep warrior damage on the hush hush
[1:58:39] finegeez1911: Go arms and you just melt things
[1:58:41] Thoreya: if arms is good for aoe in DF im switchin mains so fast
[1:58:59] dldrzoidberg: arms talent tree looks much better than fury atm
[1:59:26] Mecabeast: did we find out that it was seismic reverb nuking 3+ targets with revenge?
[1:59:31] akia03: @Thoreya check luxthos his vod from yesterday was funny to watch
[1:59:56] mayonaes: rend ticking for 3.8k, 15k revenge, 40k shield slam

[2:01:37] Wolfenhoof: what do you think happens, when a tauren hits something with a massive shield? i call that realism !
[2:01:37] FutileDiploma: Alright @towelliee chat. Havoc or fury for  first ever melee?
[2:02:05] Wolfenhoof: @FutileDiploma fury because that can be a tauren
[2:02:13] Mitune: It might be punish stacks @Towelliee

[2:02:55] mayonaes: LOL
[2:03:03] theszoti: which df dungeon is your fav so far?
[2:03:28] SamULJackson: the fuck is up with prot war, god damn
[2:03:51] Dankind64: is revenge still broken?
[2:04:01] bigsturdy64: prot warrior finally back
[2:04:12] jkitchin75: all the 20s at the same time
[2:04:12] akia03: prot wasnt used in sl so now they made sure people used prot again
[2:04:16] mayonaes: it does not show outburst procs
[2:04:22] Tatuatul: You had only 2 outbursts
[2:04:28] mayonaes: Spear is hitting very hard as well
[2:04:40] mayonaes: where do you see the outburst procs?
[2:05:15] Tatuatul: I love how warr tree is looking
[2:05:20] Mitune: Might be overlap with outburst and punish stacks
[2:05:28] Rudric_Ice: prot new meta ?
[2:05:34] Tatuatul: Big fan of Prot warr even playing it now on retail
[2:05:57] OmgItsEdizzle: execute supposed to hit like a brick
[2:06:06] bagrain: have you tried the roar and shield charge at all?
[2:06:13] Tatuatul: Low geared fair enough but still can do a 17-18 no problem at 265 ilvl
[2:06:13] NEMERL: this poor shaman doing less dmg than healer
[2:06:24] SpoofAvatar: tree seems bloated with a lot of buttons to push
[2:06:44] mayonaes: already seeing insane prot warriors in pvp
[2:07:02] ZuggSpeedman: blizz can never get prot warrior right its either garbage or insanely op
[2:07:05] Tatuatul: It’s gonna get fix for sure
[2:07:12] DPeachGaming: is that an add on to display numbers over the MOBs head or is that in game chat?
[2:07:12] mayonaes: We can hope
[2:07:16] Tatuatul: It’s to overpowered the way it is the now
[2:07:17] mayonaes: hopeium
[2:07:28] jjoohhs: the rend spread should be illegal
[2:07:31] jjoohhs: hot af
[2:07:33] Dankind64: big dam for tanks is only a plus
[2:07:50] Jollywhompus: @Towelliee are they going to stat squish damage numbers at all or is doing 10k dps going to be the starting norm
[2:07:52] dldrzoidberg: check stats after dungeon maybe scaling is bugged?
[2:07:54] r0b928: !uptime
[2:08:00] Tatuatul: The rend damage shouldn’t be that high
[2:08:17] Tatuatul: I mean bleeds shouldn’t be top dmg
[2:08:18] bigsturdy64: im loving this! seems amazing
[2:08:21] Lamyth: maybe the talent should spread rend at 50% effectiveness or something
[2:08:26] mayonaes: they will nerf rend damage by 30-50%
[2:08:36] Taaliaaaa: KEKW
[2:08:43] Orthobullet: Was htat heroic
[2:08:45] Raugdel: Deleted

[2:11:48] scumlucki: Why isnt single minded fury and titans grip a choice node instead of them being two opposite sides of the tree?
[2:12:08] AlphasaurusRexx: @DudeTheMoose they are all good. my favorite is warrior though
[2:12:19] TheItalianStallion321: im leveling a warrior right now.....is it me or did they really buff the way threads of fate works now? like its going faster the zone XP bars

[2:12:57] flebbooo: Arms is looking real good
[2:12:57] DudeTheMoose: War in ff is my fav so I was thinking maybe Blood DK. Seemed a little the same.
[2:13:07] bigsturdy64: they gave arms a baby sepsis
[2:13:19] Tatuatul: Damn u dont take any dmg what so ever….
[2:13:21] ventu105: @Towelliee is TBC cool to start as a new player?
[2:13:30] shotguner: @Towelliee im guessing youve answered this abunch but what do u think of the new Ui being updated
[2:13:34] Mecabeast: bdk plays a bit differently than other tanks
[2:13:35] DudeTheMoose: I did play Gladiator war back in the day and it was awesome. Might be better to do war since I'm sort of familiar
[2:13:40] Lamyth: I guess the talent really is take 100% less damage for until cancelled LUL
[2:13:45] TheItalianStallion321: flex the logs
[2:13:50] akia03: can you dump all rhe def talents and go pure dps?
[2:13:52] kibil_burk: why feels wrong, I dont get it? it's odd to play atm?
[2:13:53] flebbooo: KEKW

[2:17:15] pringlez91: WoW Dragonflight alpha is the best MMO in the world
[2:17:17] UltraContent: @Towelliee  why there are  no dragon aspect abilities on alpha?
[2:17:22] TheItalianStallion321: @Sollice going to check my raid ID to see if im still locked
[2:17:38] OmgItsEdizzle: on live devastator talent actually has higher proc rate
[2:17:42] Sollice: @UltraContent Because we arent aspects and it would piss everyone off lol. They dont want cov power
[2:17:50] shotguner: LUL
[2:17:52] wertywaz: KEKW
[2:18:30] UltraContent: @Sollice  what u tlakibg aboutt dragon will give for sure abilities one time u chose
[2:18:37] mayonaes: lets hope they bring back DH 30%+ leech
[2:18:42] mayonaes: pleaseeeeeee
[2:18:53] Ghoultv93: Wow 0.0
[2:18:58] Sollice: It will not. We are not doing borrowed power in this expansion. Unless something completely changes
[2:19:02] Orthobullet: DKs BIS healer for DF
[2:19:07] TheItalianStallion321: @UltraContent my raid informat still says i have all 10 bosses killed. so im not sure if its actually reset
[2:19:29] at1c: how we liking prot warrior so far?
[2:19:32] TheItalianStallion321: information*
[2:19:44] Sollice: @UltraContent Right, but I think people have stated they have recleared and are getting loot from bosses
[2:19:44] Mecabeast: currently on alpha tank rankings prot war > bear > bdk > prot pally?
[2:19:51] net_mi: is DH testable yet?
[2:20:02] Sollice: @net_mi No
[2:20:30] mayonaes: yeah that will have more value longer mobs stay alive
[2:20:48] tornbraclet: so what i am hearing is its not a broken talent but just the talent choices you picked have buffed your skill more than you thought?
[2:20:53] ventu105: @Towelliee u gonna stream wrath classic?
[2:21:12] net_mi: @net_mi You know which classes left for testing?
[2:21:17] Tatuatul: In beta the numbers will be more close to the reality then on alpha so soon will find out :D
[2:21:27] mejiro151: this is what a class tree should be, they need to get the others to be this good
[2:21:36] sylaran: hi everyone, I'm new here, may I ask a quick question? Is there a viable way for an EU player to give warrior feedback currently? I've only found an official US post so far
[2:22:01] Sollice: @sylaran Feedback on what? Alpha?
[2:22:10] sylaran: yes
[2:22:17] Sollice: Are you in alpha?
[2:22:22] SpidercowSD: whats the macro the cast on target again?
[2:22:52] sylaran: it's mainly theorycrafting concerning trees and a specific talent interaction I followed so far and sadly I'm not no
[2:23:06] bagrain: have you tried shield charge?
[2:23:18] Sollice: There what Towelliee just said
[2:23:34] theDirtyon3: Alpha feedback is US and EU feedback there is no difference
[2:23:40] biofreaks: Can you level to 70 on the alpha?
[2:23:40] Althalos94: What do u think of DF so far?
[2:23:48] sylaran: yeah feared so. Thanks though
[2:24:02] Rawhiders69: The person who made the hunter tree listens to Max on his streams feed back
[2:24:04] Mecabeast: plus some devs are probably watching and reviewing streams for alpha
[2:24:20] rudericus: Bless you
[2:24:21] sylaran: @theDirtyon3 can't post on US if I don't have characters on an US realm sadly
[2:24:27] ventu105: @Towelliee I change main from a Hunter BM to a warrior Arms
[2:24:28] brabblesauce: favorite Tank spec so far?
[2:24:39] theDirtyon3: @sylaran just make a free account on US and boom your golden
[2:24:53] UltraContent: @Sollice  btw it make nos ense, after taking some covenant power having new df covenant that maybe give u only 1 ability and not 2 would give new spell and balance  and fun ofc, its sad that these dragons cant teach u anything
[2:25:06] mavericks312: exactly cause  casuals are just gonna follow there specs anyway
[2:25:11] Rawhiders69: graycenYEP I agree
[2:25:27] brabblesauce: favorite tank spec so far?
[2:25:35] NEMERL: Better give everywhere 20% increase and everyone will be good
[2:25:37] AntistarD7: More customization makes the game fun. Especially in play style.
[2:25:40] Rawhiders69: LUL
[2:25:55] Taaliaaaa: @UltraContent bad take, borrowed power is a bad design choice we need to get away from those systems
[2:25:57] Orthobullet: oh god the spriest tree, cant wait for the blue post
[2:25:57] Stangin2122: @UltraContent  the acpects lost their power in Dragonsoul...they cannot give out power
[2:26:04] MrCheshireCat_: agree
[2:26:20] sylaran: Yeah outlaw forces a dodge interaction right now, if you want to go down your main AoE route
[2:26:21] Tatuatul: I do think Prot warr talent free is perfect the way it is as it’s so flexible towards ma y builds
[2:26:22] UltraContent: @Taaliaaaa  well is not orrowed if it remains the enxt exp
[2:26:40] tornbraclet: i like they way the went with the new talents it means there wont be a cookie cutter build for a class now
[2:26:51] brabblesauce: favorite tank spec so far?
[2:26:55] AntistarD7: Man, I really hope the tank meta in RBGs changes. Prot warrior may be first signs of it. We’ll see..
[2:26:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: im just gonna look up evoker specs a week before prepatch
[2:27:08] Rabiahtaro132: I just look into the tree changes for my mains, and my wife's mains.
[2:27:32] net_mi: They have to design the tree like that, because if you could spend all your points on prime talents then there will be no choice, everyone would go for the same talents in the tree
[2:27:39] Althalos94: Will you be able to fill out all these profession talents or do u have to choose?
[2:28:02] Sollice: @UltraContent People complained so much about borrowed power and having to choose things when they want everything. The compromise is completely new talent tree's to give you more control over the skills you take. I agree it could have been interesting to have a dragon ability but it is what it is
[2:28:15] Tatuatul: How you will get that knowledge for the profession?
[2:28:20] mavericks312: well yea cause chests are probably once per day as well
[2:28:42] scumlucki: @UltraContent Speakingon borrowed power im starting to see people actually asking for it more now lmao
[2:28:48] Althalos94: Oh I see, ty!
[2:28:58] Tatuatul: How you get that but? Dungeons or something?
[2:29:07] SilverFox_Gaming: you think they will time gate it a bit

[2:35:40] darthturtle1031: I dont see why you cant wear all crafted armor? If youre going to make a major part of the game around crafting, you shouldnt restrict crafted gear equiping. It kind of dampens the need for crafting
[2:35:41] jiffypawp: @jiffypawp gotcha, thanks
[2:35:55] doomkry: i hope blacksmith also has an option to add sockets to items like it used to in wrath iirc
[2:36:11] CanHasGaming: Okay fury time
[2:36:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: could you not work order it to yourself?
[2:36:18] flebbooo: They would be bind on account
[2:36:22] Kale_Nd: you will have to buy it from someone else with the work orders so you have to buy a token to get the gold for it
[2:36:27] biirrd: @Towelliee you can create workorders and complate them on the alt.
[2:36:37] alantin77: account bound?
[2:36:37] rosina_scarlett: Fated mythic seems like such a joke rn.. bosses are dying in 2 mins xD
[2:36:51] Armdel: how about you soulbind deez nuts to your face blizzard
[2:37:09] cinnamints: It'll also probably be like other xpacs in that these restrictions ease as we get closer to the end
[2:37:35] alantin77: would only have to add a check box's if you want to make it account bound simple fix

[2:54:36] mayonaes: wow
[2:55:44] mayonaes: potent?
[2:55:44] Rob3phones: deadly i think for crit
[2:55:45] SLoPPYALieN: deadly?
[2:55:51] Daarksyde: go with either crit or haste depending on the talent you selected that increases armor per haste/crit
[2:57:27] Daarksyde: probably random pick
[2:57:37] mayonaes: no
[2:57:41] biirrd: the ppm is sooo low, not a good item, but better then nothing i guess.
[2:57:50] mayonaes: gotta be random
[2:57:59] Daarksyde: seems to be low chance
[2:58:15] mayonaes: wtf
[2:58:18] Daarksyde: lol still random

[3:00:55] Dagomarus: Wouldnt the meta be to just gem your best stat in all 3 so it always gives you that stat?

[3:28:48] barrowzz: Calm.
[3:28:59] barrowzz: Music pog
[3:29:11] EKS90_: @leelo4673 Cause why not? rather the same cost for 16 years than an increase.
[3:29:24] lloydimus: Wrath pre patch when?
[3:29:28] Necrolyr: This is a long touching grass moment. I had time to go roll around the hill in the park and get back
[3:30:10] DeggTSK: we have x2 sub cost now due to recent events, and it's only timecards
[3:30:11] sshadeh: fury seems like giga AoE god

[3:33:34] Fawcheddar: he do be thinking its a good date
[3:33:39] Fawcheddar: LUL
[3:33:58] sshadeh: yes
[3:34:00] Sollice: Yes
[3:34:02] Racwo: YEPP
[3:34:03] Sollice: but its too far down the tree
[3:34:07] sshadeh: both single minded and titan's grip are there
[3:34:18] scumlucki: You can titan grip but you gotta spec into it
[3:34:24] EKS90_: @Towelliee right side of the tree, left side is single minded
[3:35:17] Leelo4673: When’s the mobile game out?
[3:35:24] scumlucki: cant wait to rend and thunderclap  some ass
[3:35:26] sshadeh: for m+ i feel like going down left bottom, and then grabbing titan's grip + ravager from right
[3:35:31] sshadeh: up to reck on middle
[3:35:46] DeanoTV: titans grip is on the right
[3:36:08] scumlucki: Im more of a single minded fury kind of guy
[3:36:08] gritbarontv: for the enrage stance
[3:36:34] gritbarontv: you will take more dmg while on that stance.
[3:36:42] sshadeh: @Unlucki_1s is it any different playstyle? always liked titan's grip myself cause no other spec can dualwield 2handers
[3:36:43] DeanoTV: yep
[3:37:05] saevenar: right side is titans fury, left is single minded fury
[3:37:06] DeanoTV: sudden
[3:37:11] Racwo: sudden death always
[3:37:14] sshadeh: fury without rampage LUL
[3:37:26] scumlucki: @sshadeh i think its more leech and crit from what im seeing
[3:37:30] sshadeh: and you need rampage to get reck
[3:37:32] Vandictus: Was fiddling with Arms tree the other day, was quite hard to make choices. Fury is easier to decide imo
[3:37:40] RubyMoonshine: atm TG and SMF play the same but there are a lot more talents for SMF coming in DF which is having me worried
[3:37:58] Daarksyde: the one hand wep spec sounds good with the auto attack procs
[3:38:12] sshadeh: you get stat stick with titan's grip
[3:38:56] scumlucki: odyns fury plus thunderclap and rend bleed build? poggers
[3:38:59] DeanoTV: ye improved WW is good
[3:39:10] DeanoTV: buffs it to 4 instead of 2
[3:39:12] sshadeh: ye
[3:39:13] RubyMoonshine: na rend and thunderclap cost rage so should be avoided
[3:39:18] gritbarontv: yup
[3:39:19] xEskii: this is just whirlwind from live now
[3:39:21] sshadeh: you whirlwind and then use couple single target skills
[3:39:23] scumlucki: yeh
[3:39:23] sshadeh: in AoE
[3:39:24] Mecabeast: it makes ww a filler ability when everything else is on cd
[3:39:25] gritbarontv: it gives you a mini buff
[3:39:25] Racwo: yep
[3:39:34] Racwo: rampage also
[3:39:35] Snabido: Enabling cleave on STs
[3:39:37] xEskii: no
[3:39:38] gritbarontv: single
[3:39:39] scumlucki: you can use rampage
[3:39:55] Aquadriel: its a mini blade flurry from rogue
[3:40:18] tornbraclet: i would still pick up imp WW even with SmF
[3:40:31] sshadeh: ^
[3:40:33] sshadeh: always for AoE
[3:40:45] RubyMoonshine: Improved WW is a must
[3:41:18] sshadeh: yes but i feel arms will be overall better for ST
[3:41:32] Mecabeast: standard prio is rampage > execute > raging blow > blood thirst > whirlwind with cold steel hot blood swap raging blow and bloodthirst
[3:41:37] rodimusprime085: Dragonflight gonnna be another Fury xpack!!!! i want MS meta back
[3:41:49] sshadeh: meat cleaver is improved improved WW
[3:41:51] sshadeh: LUL
[3:42:02] flebbooo: yeah sus KEKW
[3:42:02] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100631756-15027263 towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC! They have an excellent 24/7 support team, supreme pc build quality and your PC will arrive at your house in a wooden crate!
[3:42:05] tornbraclet: @sshadeh i think that is what blizzard wants them to go
[3:42:21] Snabido: Meat cleaver into meat grinder
[3:42:23] Mecabeast: meat cleaver makes it so you ww every 5 globals instead of every 3
[3:42:28] sshadeh: @tornbraclet ye, fury seems like AoE god
[3:42:28] Imperius_Aeon: arms tree is much better than fury imo
[3:42:31] xEskii: yeah it's so much filler talents from what we already have on live which sucks
[3:42:33] tornbraclet: fury=AOE and arms= ST
[3:42:34] Sollice: Asmon said the same thing. A lot of the passives are being split and feels like filling the tree as opposed to making something new
[3:42:43] saevenar: but you can take the lower one without going to the upper section of the tree. that's a big deal imo
[3:42:44] gritbarontv: for aoe you will spam WW
[3:42:47] Roaringkittylol: I like the possibility of having less buttons on my bar in dragonflight. Huge fan of BFA pruning.
[3:43:06] DeanoTV: They already said they are happy with the way the specs are so nothing new really
[3:43:12] xEskii: Like Ret paladins, they took wings from live and split it into 4 talents
[3:43:14] the_viznar: Incarn is same
[3:43:18] xEskii: oh, he said that
[3:43:23] gritbarontv: well people wanted options, lol
[3:43:41] GroovyBryan: GroovyBryan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:43:42] Daarksyde: yall forget we have no idea what kind of legs or additional "abilities" will be added in DF
[3:43:52] mmmatt_: definitely siegebreaker
[3:43:56] tornbraclet: @gritbarontv spam WW then use ramp and thats all the buttons you need lol
[3:43:58] scumlucki: @Daark11 we might not get legendaries lol
[3:44:15] Racwo: @Unlucki_1s hopefully not
[3:44:19] sshadeh: its nice fury gets odyn's fury back tho
[3:44:22] sshadeh: it was really missing that
[3:44:27] Daarksyde: @Unlucki_1s but we dont know that or know what kind of "leg" abilities will be added
[3:44:32] sshadeh: and you can pair it with dragon's roar for AoE
[3:44:42] gritbarontv: @tornbraclet true, lol
[3:44:46] DeanoTV: @Towelliee They already said they are happy with the way the specs are so nothing new really
[3:44:53] scumlucki: @sshadeh its thunderous roar now
[3:44:58] Attackroot: @towelliee u can ww and then hit siege breaker and it will effect aoe targets.
[3:45:05] sshadeh: @Unlucki_1s ah, right
[3:45:14] RubyMoonshine: Can't wait to try out a MM+ bleed build
[3:45:19] gritbarontv: that's a bubble breaker
[3:45:20] xziyn: Why not both
[3:45:22] draftbrew: anger management is always good right?
[3:45:24] mmmatt_: siebreaker talents, anger management and odyns fury
[3:45:32] Vandictus: Anger Management prolly works nicely with Spear of Bastion from the general warrior tree
[3:45:39] xEskii: odyns fury is for single minded
[3:45:39] RubyMoonshine: Siegebreaker is generally underwhelming
[3:45:42] Vandictus: To line up cooldowns
[3:45:55] sshadeh: ye
[3:45:56] xziyn: Legion artifact ability
[3:45:58] sshadeh: the giga AoE burst
[3:45:58] flebbooo: yeeep
[3:46:15] xziyn: The better DH artifact ability lol
[3:46:19] sshadeh: the passive after odyn's is nice if you take thunderous roar
[3:46:25] sshadeh: for m+
[3:46:52] RubyMoonshine: The bloodbourne talent with TR, OF and gushing wounds will be something
[3:46:52] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[3:46:59] draftbrew: siege for m+
[3:47:13] sshadeh: ikr
[3:47:18] xEskii: @Towelliee whats the talent under Odyns Fury?
[3:47:18] Racwo: because we warriors are GIGACHAD
[3:47:21] mmmatt_: this tree is nuts
[3:47:24] sshadeh: meanwhile shadow priest...
[3:47:25] sshadeh: LUL
[3:47:27] NoxAnk: Actually Arms is my favorite so far
[3:47:28] Daarksyde: getting 2/3 of the talents/passives lol
[3:47:36] Velot_: You don't like buffed consecration? Kappa
[3:47:43] mmmatt_: you can get avatar too it's wild
[3:47:52] ashwing_: KEKW
[3:47:58] scumlucki: Dont forget to pick up rend for some bleed damage janixVIBE
[3:48:00] sshadeh: you can mix so many warrior powers now
[3:48:02] sshadeh: across all specs
[3:48:07] Velot_: But you can spec to have it heal you for 36hp every 0.9 seconds KEKW
[3:48:11] MayroVision: I am so lost on the new Trees.
[3:48:11] Velot_: Thanks Blizz
[3:48:15] sshadeh: @Unlucki_1s wait, does rend work with WW LUL as fury
[3:48:15] scumlucki: sucks that i cant get ignore pain as furny anymore tho
[3:48:23] xziyn: The Ret tree is still pretty good though
[3:48:32] scumlucki: @sshadeh you can also thunderclap and spread rend
[3:48:34] TheItalianStallion321: since cata or MoP
[3:48:42] gritbarontv: just wait for the min-maxers to give the cookie builds
[3:48:44] xEskii: MoP
[3:48:50] MayroVision: Lol
[3:48:50] itscityboy: i loveeeee the talent tree addition
[3:48:56] DeggTSK: so much skills to hurl into enemy
[3:48:58] xziyn: MoP was current talents
[3:49:02] sshadeh: @Unlucki_1s right
[3:49:05] raphlex: y'a des français ici ?
[3:49:05] Snabido: The early ones and last ones will prolly be easier to remember
[3:49:07] tornbraclet: wait can fury get deep wounds too?
[3:49:11] coldhandsbeatz: Feels like trees are being very hit or miss. Some of them look incredible but in general theres so much of splitting one baseline abilty into 3 talents that you are gonna pick
[3:49:12] goofywizard: It's gonna be very good to customize during pvp
[3:49:13] scumlucki: talent trees give my brain a nice scracth
[3:49:16] Skitso777: this is nothing compared PoE lol
[3:49:21] Imperius_Aeon: thats what ion said he wanted to do
[3:49:25] mattyb_23: GlitchCat
[3:49:28] Imperius_Aeon: "load outs"
[3:49:30] raphlex: nike ta mère towellie stp
[3:49:32] scumlucki: poe talent tree is something else
[3:49:35] Thoreya: give me anything other than the shit talents we have rn
[3:49:54] draftbrew: definitely adds another element of fun to the game
[3:50:01] Thoreya: except mage. bc mage is bad
[3:50:02] sshadeh: well the PoE tree is bit different cause its literally only passives, a lot of them being simple damage or health increases
[3:50:08] sshadeh: WoW trees have actives too
[3:50:20] xziyn: @raphlex So courageous insulting in French
[3:50:21] Phil87z: Phil87z subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[3:50:31] coldhandsbeatz: Import them from wow armory would be cool haha also from inspect-talents

[3:51:01] Thoreya: so do rogues
[3:51:05] Racwo: we are the interupt
[3:51:06] gritbarontv: depends on the LFD queues for DPS, lol
[3:51:07] Thoreya: and mages right?
[3:51:10] Snabido: Yeah, fuck you wtf KEKW
[3:51:12] xziyn: Also improved rally is nuts lol
[3:51:15] Lincoln_WoW: i imagine a lot of prot paladins will want to play ret instead lmao
[3:51:15] Racwo: yes we do :)
[3:51:16] the_viznar: @Towelliee tanks are a dying breed tho
[3:51:16] flebbooo: Warriors built different EZ
[3:51:18] Imperius_Aeon: towelliee pls
[3:51:19] jayXtream: that sounds perfect
[3:51:20] scumlucki: i can use die by the  sword as fury come on now
[3:51:23] DrBrumm: warriors are simply superior xD
[3:51:25] Baaltaza: Why not? KEKW
[3:51:26] Allsee_: Warrior is the first hero class Kappa
[3:51:27] saevenar: so do rogus. i think interrupts will all become baseline
[3:51:27] Mecabeast: warriors and rouges  were like the go to interupt classes for awhile right
[3:51:28] Frank4LuLz: Frank4LuLz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[3:51:31] Mitune: or shaman
[3:51:36] Baaltaza: Warri ftw
[3:51:37] draftbrew: dragon tank Pog
[3:51:40] im_capy: tank with a range dps spec
[3:51:41] scumlucki: Im sure evokers will get a tank spec soon
[3:51:44] Wukain: let us have our day game been pally and hero classes to long
[3:51:47] itscityboy: anybody have any recommendations for a new router?
[3:51:48] the_viznar: not me
[3:51:50] Unciatim: None
[3:51:52] kirkules78: cheer1500
[3:51:52] the_viznar: locked in on war
[3:52:01] coldhandsbeatz: Not adding a tank is definitely a miss
[3:52:02] Angsterz: every class they added had tank spec tho
[3:52:02] Effin_Steffin: Towelliee doesnt want Warriors having nice things, confirmed.
[3:52:04] gotcha2157: i will tank
[3:52:04] Silverwards: i'm picking up tanking :P Evoker is my first alt tho
[3:52:05] TheItalianStallion321: isnt there a tank shortage now? lol
[3:52:06] PhillyDilly18: Why tank shortage?
[3:52:06] Imperius_Aeon: evoker is trash though
[3:52:10] Racwo: not with the dps warr tank is doin KEKW @Towelliee
[3:52:11] xolossus00: @Towelliee anhh everyone rerolling prot warrior
[3:52:13] Frank4LuLz: good morning big dawg, fuck woyers, pally rule...blizz hates pallys...truth
[3:52:14] draftbrew: and what little tanks there are will be warriors KEKW
[3:52:15] goofywizard: Dragon Tank could have been an accommodation for shamans. I but know people have been asking for it and will bring it
[3:52:19] xolossus00: @Towelliee nahh everyone rerolling prot warrior
[3:52:20] GamingDad77: GamingDad77 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[3:52:20] scumlucki: im too lazy to level any other classes so i have like 10 copy warriors lol
[3:52:28] xziyn: Aren't blood dk and bears pretty good though?
[3:52:37] xolossus00: XDDD
[3:52:40] goofywizard: If people can cause an uproar about the Hoggers models, surely we can get evoker tanks
[3:52:43] Bawpears: What if they do though? We the OG tank
[3:52:45] moa285: AngelThump
[3:52:45] tornbraclet: i have not tanked on my warrior since MoP it didnt feel like prot warrior was in a good place back then
[3:52:46] Frank4LuLz: Pro Pallys will be the shit this exp
[3:52:47] Revoca: Why do you think that? please elaborate, was there a shortage in SL ???
[3:52:58] GamingDad77: I agree. Dracthyr should absolutely have a tank spec.
[3:53:00] the_viznar: I only tank - unless I'm pvp'ing
[3:53:02] Revoca: Why do you think that? please elaborate, was there a shortage in SL ??? @Towelliee
[3:53:09] lucid_wow: hell i mean most of the top m+ tanks raid as dps, even naowh who just got rank 1 io as tank is swapping to dps to raid
[3:53:16] Cakeabsorber: Everyone want to SMOrc DPS?
[3:53:22] xziyn: Tanking is way too boring in raids is the real issue tbh

[3:53:41] Bawpears: That M+ pressure
[3:53:42] kirkules78: I love tanking in FF14 but can't stand it WoW for some reason
[3:53:44] PhillyDilly18: Do you ever see them moving away from the trinity?
[3:53:45] Velot_: Mythic Plus is brutal for tanks. Having DPS players blow up at you because you are doing the 'incorrect' route is just not a nice experience.
[3:53:54] Draethar: Havoc Demon Hunter is gonna be broken just wait…
[3:53:58] Offeli: idk i think theres more than enough tanks at like ~+25 key range
[3:53:59] Frank4LuLz: because of my work schedule im just a filthy casual now, sadge, but im hoping this exp. is alot more friendlier
[3:54:08] myfans4141: wow thats a pretty good build towellie
[3:54:09] lucid_wow: m+ tanking is actually fun i think a lot of the issue is you need to raid to get the best gear in the game but raid tanking is the single most boring thing in the entire game so you see top end tanks like dorki and now naowh playing dps in raid to get the gear to tank m+
[3:54:10] Unciatim: Ok... so you can't find reliable tanks now with what you got, what makes you think an additional tank class with all its caviates/balances will improve that?
[3:54:19] Bawpears: Thats why I just go with guildies, i know not everyone has that luxury
[3:54:21] scumlucki: @kirkules78 tanking in ff14 is so easy all you gotta do is tand and look pretty infront of your group lol plus dungeons in ff14 are super linear
[3:54:33] scumlucki: i miss my drk
[3:54:34] Mecabeast: when your a dps you basically can't pug keys without waiting forever which only gets worse when you flame tanks and healers
[3:54:38] paragon_3: worst part is people are just expected to know this
[3:54:56] Velot_: I've found it's a bit more forgiving on Alliance side, but that might just be anecdotal. @Towelliee
[3:54:59] xziyn: I feel there are a lot less healers than tanks though
[3:55:01] kirkules78: @Unlucki_1s True, and I can tank in WoW I just don't find it fun anymore
[3:55:05] akia03: arnt healers harder to find than tanks?
[3:55:06] xziyn: At least that's how it is in KR
[3:55:07] Frank4LuLz: yup, i just want my tank pally gnome...come on blizz
[3:55:13] scumlucki: I give all respect to tanks and healers i cant do that shit my  brain is strictly dps
[3:55:15] whyabadi: DK had 3x tanking specs
[3:55:22] Jollywhompus: We also haven't had a new tank since M+ launched
[3:55:26] Taaliaaaa: DKs could tank in any spec lmao
[3:55:31] berserker_strike: i guess ill play tank
[3:55:38] Ribastur0075: we can already expect a lot of evoker heal and dps
[3:55:39] tornbraclet: i remember when DK came out i would run all DK groups through TBC
[3:55:50] PrillaGorilla: More like I go back to my BM hubter
[3:55:51] myfans4141: heavy is the head that wears the crown
[3:55:53] PrillaGorilla: Hunter
[3:55:55] flebbooo: 10.3 for sure Kappa
[3:55:55] Frank4LuLz: Shiny Tank spec
[3:55:57] Mitune: I say Shaman tank before that. The Base tree is already setup with no modification needed
[3:55:57] Revoca: they should add the walrus guys as the tank class for dragon flight @Towelliee
[3:55:58] Ribastur0075: and range/dh or heal dh/leach
[3:56:00] NEMERL: Problem is that in raids u need only 2 tank on 30ppl on hc ONLY 2 @Towelliee this is problem and m+ higher keys need from you to know routing, pool mangment etc.
[3:56:15] Taaliaaaa: I remember running shattered halls with 4 other dks and we all just tanked when we could lmao
[3:56:16] jetributions: but they have to be buff as much as murculies
[3:56:18] shotguner: why not warrior for tank

[3:56:46] Reverez: Reverez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[3:56:52] xziyn: Seeing improved rally for wars, will probably be back
[3:57:16] scumlucki: What is rallying cry for is it like a emergency def i rarely ever press the button
[3:57:17] GoodGuyHeliioz: Oh gotcha just tuned in
[3:57:25] GamingDad77: I watched Lux play arms yesterday. all I can say is BRO-KEN
[3:57:27] SpoofAvatar: Where is the Gladiator spec?
[3:57:28] doomkry: @Towelliee most warrior builds i seen go mostly left side
[3:57:29] Jollywhompus: @Towelliee do you think the high gold & time sink for alts to get things like legendaries discourages people from rolling tanks & healers as alts
[3:57:33] suppstantial: suppstantial subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[3:57:35] dinadreth_: Is the second wind the same one thats on live? @Towelliee

[3:58:09] Vandictus: @Unlucki_1s It has been very usefull for raiding this expantion, at least
[3:58:13] GoodGuyHeliioz: I want devistator class to come back, that was the shield dps right ?
[3:58:17] GamingDad77: @Mecabeast it was arms im sure
[3:58:19] Aquadriel: spell reflect? fuck that, healers work to keep me up on that shit Kappa

[4:00:04] xziyn: Aren't you playing TG? Why do you want the 1h bonus?
[4:00:07] flebbooo: Blood and thunder for fury might either be troll af or op LUL
[4:00:13] Cakeabsorber: one 2h and a 1h off hand? KEKW
[4:00:17] suppstantial: I mean I probably should just realm transfer my existing one but why not level with time to kill
[4:00:28] doomkry: yeah if going 1h talents yougo mostly left side on fury tree

[4:02:45] doomkry: @vizbear achimithros said rend thunderclap is not big compared to saving rage to spend on rampage
[4:03:00] scumlucki: gonna miss being able to bladestorm as a fury (ik signet of kings exist)
[4:03:32] xziyn: I feel you won't have the GCD for Rend/TC as Fury tbh
[4:03:43] sshadeh: feels nice to have more buttons on fury
[4:03:47] sshadeh: compared to now
[4:03:48] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee go devastator! :D
[4:04:03] Ooshraxa: ah, fury
[4:04:28] tornbraclet: when you charge in hit rend then TC and start your rotation
[4:04:34] Rexy95: buff rally cry ?
[4:04:50] Roaringkittylol: I just hope Monk has the option of less utility and more dmg for pvp. Rather annoying having 3 keybinds for all those abilities.
[4:04:59] Bawpears: THe leech is one handed only
[4:05:01] draftbrew: avatar for sure, right?
[4:05:09] doomkry: no
[4:05:11] xziyn: Improved Rally instead of Crushing Force?
[4:05:17] flebbooo: But u are titan's grip? Thats only one handed wep
[4:05:23] loutre_malgache: Take Avatar 100% and the talent below it, the leg effect
[4:05:23] DeggTSK: 10% leech only for one-handed, you have titan's grip
[4:05:26] flebbooo: for the leech
[4:05:35] Mecabeast: not sure but it'll be more ways to proc signet of tormented kings
[4:05:56] Rexy95: but you dont get the leech with titans grip ?
[4:06:03] goosejamss: avatar is a big dps spike
[4:06:07] loutre_malgache: Avatar 100% a d signet of tormented king.
[4:06:08] Attackroot: Lego power below avatar
[4:06:09] doomkry: if they add ravager to signet fury aoe is gonna be insane
[4:06:18] xziyn: You play Titan's Grip anyway so 10% leech is useless
[4:06:28] loutre_malgache: man Fck bastion spear and take Signet of tormented king.
[4:06:33] ashwing_: How it should be LUL
[4:06:41] donin: as God intended

[4:25:57] Sollice: lol
[4:26:07] SLoPPYALieN: @shutupRoman It should be right in the middle using up some of that shitty white space I think.... Like War Mode button at top or bottom to enable, and the three talents in the middle.
[4:26:08] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Will you be trying SMF with the weapon throwing thingy?
[4:26:11] Unciatim: @shutupRoman I think it would look better if they just deleted PVP...

[4:41:20] Squats3: in aoe at least
[4:41:36] Todmeister9000: @Towelliee are you playing S4 or is alpha more fun?
[4:41:42] Shapelessdnb: Single minded bleed build Pog
[4:41:48] Woodland_Critter: @TheItalianStallion321 To my recollection, there are usually more people around.
[4:41:53] scumlucki: im gonna 100 percent make a singleminded bleed build
[4:42:01] sshadeh: DF m+ group just gonna be 3 fury warriors and shaman healer for lust
[4:42:05] BlewGamingGroup: there was a lot more poeple invite to shadowlands early on
[4:42:05] sshadeh: YEP
[4:42:09] DrakeDuude: S4 just launched so im sure most are playing that
[4:42:09] Squats3: @Towelliee S4 starting probably doesnt help.
[4:42:10] TheItalianStallion321: @Woodland_Critter gotcha
[4:42:22] Imperius_Aeon: 90% of testing, 1% of actual gameplay

[4:42:29] Allsee_: Still wish Torg was endless
[4:42:41] BlewGamingGroup: blizz is just being stingy with the invites
[4:42:47] Barfuu: maybe they should invite even more ppl to alpha
[4:42:48] Thoreya: @sshadeh arms is even more broken than fury
[4:42:50] Squats3: @Towelliee they need ot just invite me to the alpha. definitely the issue 100%
[4:42:54] scumlucki: feel bad for demon hunteres there tree is prolly gonna be a sham
[4:42:58] EKS90_: @cabalish Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:43:43] sshadeh: @Thoreya for ST or AoE
[4:43:44] Squats3: @Unlucki_1s well - seeing as the 2nd class tree was delayed due to the mage tree reaction, id say they probably wont release any trees untll they look really good
[4:43:52] SLoPPYALieN: I love the WW Execute on Live too... it's great
[4:43:52] cahoots82: Doesn't WW work like it does in retail?

[4:44:12] xEskii: yeah WW already works like this its nothing new really lol
[4:44:21] cahoots82: Gotcha, just making sure I didn't miss something.
[4:44:23] rymerre: it works exactly the same as retail
[4:44:37] Woodland_Critter: Honestly, just invite people who actually want to test. Instead of these people who log in for 10 minutes, hit a dummy for a bit, only to go back to retail to spam M+ or arenas.
[4:44:40] Squats3: yeah
[4:44:40] cahoots82: Warrior Fury tree got like 99% of the things they wanted.
[4:44:40] BlewGamingGroup: that is so broken
[4:44:41] scumlucki: shhhhh blizzard might be listening
[4:44:42] zorantt: @Towelliee Is it a horde issue or an alpha issue? Does the Alliance have more players playing in alpha?

[4:44:55] rockytcp: i love this

[4:45:00] xEskii: alliance never has more players LUL
[4:45:00] sshadeh: @Towelliee since DHs don't have as many old abilities, they are gonna have their entire shadowlands tree at once LUL
[4:45:03] BlewGamingGroup: fun detected
[4:45:06] Cakeabsorber: 2? KEKW
[4:45:12] Attackroot: Rofl
[4:45:15] ShieldslamTV: I mean Siegebreaker alone with all those CDs is nuts, that's a lot of aoe
[4:45:20] scumlucki: how do you have 2 alpha accounts lmao
[4:45:22] pavepawns: this man flexing his alpha status
[4:45:29] r0b928: Streamer benefits
[4:45:34] SLoPPYALieN: two box that shit :D
[4:45:34] Squats3: they might have an issue where they made shaman way to good and they cant go back. they will have to tune numbers instead of keeping you from getting lots of fun things. (which is good)

[4:46:45] scumlucki: jesus
[4:46:47] Woodland_Critter: Maybe, just maybe cross faction should be a thing for testing.
[4:46:49] Nerendis: And 2 of them are you
[4:46:50] zorantt: So it's an alpha issue then. Interesting

[4:48:18] AxelyuS7: hows fury?
[4:48:25] Imperius_Aeon: blizzard is scared of rextroy
[4:48:31] Squats3: @Towelliee seems like the perfect guy to have in alpha
[4:48:47] Cojoha: morning, i caved and got a calzone
[4:48:53] Nehcrom: And also he informs blizz before releasing the video giving them the chance to fix it.
[4:49:00] zorantt: Whatever happened to the Redshirtguy from Blizzcons? Haven't heard much about him
[4:49:07] llNoTToXiCll: yeah i would want Rextroy play any alpha or beta because hes really good at finding and manipulating untill it makes blizzard change it
[4:49:10] GamingDad77: yeah. but when he breaks it....he BREAKS it
[4:49:14] llNoTToXiCll: to play *
[4:49:20] benyo1989: Do Mages get Deathborne back in DF? Saw in on the Class Changes but it's not on the Calculator
[4:49:44] iAmFlashyy: is there a way to get your abilities UI to look like towelliees? or is that an addon?
[4:49:48] llNoTToXiCll: i'd tank but i dont got alphas or betas
[4:49:55] Scarhearth: @benyo1989 no
[4:49:57] R0yalFluffy: Necro ability from shadowlands
[4:50:01] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  it's the necrolord ability for mages
[4:50:01] raye_gaming22: necro
[4:50:03] SLoPPYALieN: @iAmFlashyy That's the new UI for DF
[4:50:04] Ribastur0075: They should start to invite more into alpha
[4:50:14] LeDerpski: No they dont
[4:50:22] scumlucki: fweshcwaft
[4:50:24] SLoPPYALieN: @iAmFlashyy you can unlock and move the bars around and such.
[4:50:27] benyo1989: @Scarhearth It was listed on the last class changes on wowhead
[4:50:36] iAmFlashyy: @SLoPPYALieN ooo gotcha thats clean
[4:51:09] SLoPPYALieN: It's getting better each week.
[4:51:12] llNoTToXiCll: i never get my hopes up for being able to participate in beta's i think i only got into 1-2 alphas or betas
[4:51:25] BurtMacklin410: aren't they redesigning the frames too?
[4:51:31] SLoPPYALieN: snapping still doesn't work, but changing the padding/sizing is a good start.
[4:51:32] BurtMacklin410: yeah
[4:51:37] scumlucki: give us built in weak auras
[4:51:42] llNoTToXiCll: thats what move everything is for :P
[4:52:00] sshadeh: they are
[4:52:09] cahoots82: built in WA would just confuse the shit out of people
[4:52:15] Brumbs: What add ons do you see becoming obsolete due to the new UI? @towelliee
[4:52:17] jrossino: Do we know when dragonflight releases
[4:52:25] moistshrimp: hows the alpha
[4:52:29] MrSnekyDino: At what point do they normally allow addons in the testing?
[4:52:37] scumlucki: @jrossino tthey say this year but i dont believe it
[4:52:40] Sollice: @jrossino Not today or tomorrow but supposedly by the end of the year at least
[4:52:40] sshadeh: i play default UI in shadowlands YEP
[4:52:48] Scarhearth: @benyo1989 its on the class changes all it wants but if its not actually in the tree or spellbooks it doesnt exist to use outside of shadowlands content
[4:52:58] xDsChromis: Hows the new warrior?
[4:52:58] generaljosh721: i think this will replace bartender for me, but that's probably it
[4:53:11] Thoreya: @jrossino prob november
[4:53:13] Thoreya: like SL
[4:53:40] iAmFlashyy: Started playing a few weeks ago and using the default UI i feel like its impossible to use lmfao
[4:53:49] paragon_3: One of my favorite things about wow is the use of addons I wish more games would allow for it
[4:53:54] scumlucki: they should move away from 2d models when it comes to gear give us more 3d modles
[4:54:11] Badziee: you think mid november? that would be great
[4:54:26] scumlucki: @Badziee morelike next year janurary

[4:55:08] ScottxTee: Wrath was good in the wrath days time to move on
[4:55:09] marZau: no lfd is a fkn braindead decision
[4:55:09] kenuckey: and the beta being broken
[4:55:10] Loktow: why would they do that to my boy!
[4:55:11] emznev: Not heard to much about wrath
[4:55:11] jkitchin75: @emznev keep telling yourself that
[4:55:12] MrSnekyDino: Ugh they're insane for removing LFD
[4:55:17] DeanoTV: New stuff > nostalgia
[4:55:21] TweektheProphet: no LFD is a dumb decision
[4:55:31] emznev: @emznev it was a joke KEKW
[4:55:40] Badziee: wait, no LFD??
[4:55:47] Squats3: @Towelliee wrath will be a cool thing ot have till DF launch. probably wont get ulduar till feb which is also good
[4:55:52] sshadeh: desperate times
[4:55:54] tornbraclet: they said no LFD was agreed on by the community lol
[4:55:59] generaljosh721: offering rub n tug for tank
[4:56:09] MrSnekyDino: Small minority begged for it to be removed
[4:56:10] ThisIzD: ngl the no lfd kinda turned me off. I used to love just queing on the weekends with my prot pally
[4:56:12] nodz_n: how does furry war feels like ? is better then rn on retail and whats new?
[4:56:31] Badziee: and it will stay like that?
[4:56:34] Nessebr: so basically the queueing system for m+?
[4:56:41] Squats3: @nodz_n you basically can get all 3 of your lvl 60 talents in 1 build. its pretty nutty
[4:56:42] SaDos: @towelliee there is no way people are doing to use onslaught.. you should try a different build
[4:56:44] PatchesMcPatch: I didnt agree to no LFD
[4:56:46] BlewGamingGroup: what community ? FF ?
[4:56:51] MrSnekyDino: The same small minority that screamed #nochanges screamed for no LFD
[4:56:54] Badziee: ooh
[4:56:54] 00birdhouse: the same people who agreed that grim rail Depot was a good idea
[4:57:00] epiczplz: agreed i have not missed a raid day in tbc classic since launch and i didnt agree that too
[4:57:00] Jango_: I agree with no LFD if this is classic wotlk
[4:57:02] AxelyuS7: onslaught
[4:57:04] ArcaneSyntax: no LFD is gonna hurt it so much
[4:57:04] Nerendis: They listened to their investors on no LFD
[4:57:07] Jango_: you want lfd play retail
[4:57:13] SolobirdGames: yeah, I wont play without LFG. It was awsome with OP gear to carry ppl
[4:57:15] Zilberg: LUL The one guy that has 5 friends he always plays with
[4:57:20] generaljosh721: i wont play wrath if there's no LFD, I dont have time for that
[4:57:21] Scarhearth: they listened to holly on that im sure
[4:57:27] SaDos: oh wow you didn't pick gushing wound?????? bruh..
[4:57:36] Malfleur: I can promise you they will change this because other classes do not have the option to get 3 bottom talents
[4:57:36] MrSnekyDino: LFD was in WOTLK, yes, added at the end, but Classic has historically been using the end patch of the expac.
[4:58:12] Scarhearth: Cold steel, Hot Blood @Towelliee
[4:58:14] SaDos: thats it cold steel hot blood
[4:58:35] Jango_: @roadrrunnerr1 Why would the FF community not want a LFD tool, its in FF
[4:58:38] Zilberg: Titans grip always… Dual wielding 2hs will always be my way to go
[4:58:43] Scarhearth: It was the best fury azerite power
[4:59:00] Scarhearth: get rid of onslaught and double improved raging blow
[4:59:03] stevefox10: 15% seems low
[4:59:04] sshadeh: i think the DoT increase is only worth if you also take thunderous roar from class tree
[4:59:05] Rudric_Ice: !uptime

[5:05:39] Pacxster: ngl in love with the fury tree, cant wait to play around with it
[5:05:51] tornbraclet: i have a feeling i will spend like 2 days messing around with the new talents on my classes to find the one i like lol
[5:06:36] sshadeh: DoT
[5:06:41] Squats3: @Towelliee idk if its working.
[5:06:44] SaDos: yes
[5:06:47] Mecabeast: I have a rough idea what I'll pick will confirm based off what top warcraftlogs pick
[5:06:54] SaDos: same as the talent
[5:07:18] Sionz: I can tank for you
[5:07:19] SaDos: bloodthirst applies it
[5:07:27] Velarn435: Is this 1 handed fury or 2?

[5:07:52] Eli787: pop reck
[5:07:53] enderlol: yes
[5:07:56] enderlol: look at your talents
[5:07:57] llNoTToXiCll: i think there is a gonna be tons of macros for this expansion
[5:08:03] SaDos: in bfa it was the best azerite by far and crit was priority
[5:08:07] stevefox10: seems like gushing wounfs is trash at this power level
[5:08:15] stevefox10: u need crit to run it
[5:08:20] aleksmetha: we stacked crit in bfa
[5:08:29] Mecabeast: you might just have to stack more crit
[5:08:33] Krisperhammer: a talent that increases the crit chance of the next bloodthirst bu 10% stacking to 5 times
[5:08:43] Shapelessdnb: Probably good for some fights
[5:08:58] Mamiwata: get some alchemy crit phial?
[5:09:02] chris234628: does arms and fury still have ignore pain?
[5:09:06] Kooznik: @Towelliee What would Fury look like with one 2H wep. Cause you technically don't have to spec Titans grip or single minded fury
[5:09:15] gelimarr: I reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally like arms
[5:09:19] stevefox10: yeah probably
[5:09:19] Shapelessdnb: YEP
[5:09:23] SaDos: you definitely do
[5:09:26] enderlol: @chris3721 no
[5:09:41] aleksmetha: siege
[5:09:49] gelimarr: D>
[5:09:52] Daarksyde: i'm thinking single-minded might the best route for single boss fights, proccing auto attacks for enrage
[5:09:54] Mecabeast: the 2nd improve whirlwind I would drop
[5:09:55] Scarhearth: siegebreaker isnt important

[5:19:40] Woodland_Critter: Warrior is part of it, but I also reckon the general power level of the characters is too high relative to the mobs @XarkoLP

[5:22:41] SaDos: no need bro.. titans grip will always be better
[5:22:45] Sollice: Molv
[5:22:49] figzo123: change your specialisation to arms so u get 2handed only or that doesnt work anymore
[5:22:50] Sollice: Did you just get on?
[5:22:51] Molvonos: I use One-hands and titans grip every night yo
[5:22:52] Molvonos: What
[5:22:55] Molvonos: I did
[5:22:56] kislikss: Pot lot for . Arms . No more 1h drop
[5:22:58] SaDos: the damage increase from smf must be insane for it to be better
[5:23:10] Sollice: Uhh Towelliee was asking earlier if you did a highlight of something yesterday....
[5:23:15] Sollice: Maybe prot?
[5:23:16] SauceFu: double fisting FTW
[5:23:18] Woodland_Critter: Single-minded Fury looks pretty legit, at least on paper for DF.
[5:23:34] Molvonos: I did.  I did all the highlights, though something specific?
[5:23:39] mejiro151: I like it as I main prot, so its easier to use my 1 handers than trying to get 2 handers
[5:23:42] Molvonos: I can find it real fast if I know what to look for
[5:23:42] Rudric_Ice: only pussies use one handers
[5:23:43] sshadeh: extra secondary stats from second 2h weapon Kreygasm
[5:23:46] Myathe: it does kinda look like Firelands up in here
[5:23:48] paulaodoveneno: muche better one hands, faster gamplay, like a crazy berseker
[5:23:53] Sollice: @Towelliee What highlight were you talking about for Molv earlier this morning?
[5:23:55] llNoTToXiCll: Ask the tank now @Towelliee
[5:23:57] scumlucki: im going single minded fury cause the 2handers just look like longswords
[5:24:03] DanielMorenoMiniatures: and that is why people dont want to tank
[5:24:04] HAMMERRAZOR: hey @Towelliee hey chat how are we all?
[5:24:07] shmoopsy: but that would be the smart thing to do
[5:24:16] Aquadriel: evokers the new pepegas to replace hunters and dhs?
[5:24:20] sshadeh: @Unlucki_1s tmog dude, you can make them look like anything
[5:24:24] paulaodoveneno: single minded always, faster gamplay
[5:24:28] wreckshoptv: hi towelliee hows fury warr feeling?
[5:24:38] raldrik: just hit revenge right
[5:24:42] scumlucki: @Unlucki_1s i can tmog one handed wepaons over 2 handed weapons
[5:24:42] sshadeh: @paulaodoveneno play rogue for that Kappa
[5:24:43] Sollice: I dunno Molv lol
[5:24:48] scumlucki: ?
[5:24:52] Molvonos: I'll find out in a sec
[5:24:59] scumlucki: or vice versa?
[5:25:05] Scarhearth: Ive always said SMF should be balanced by having giga haste small damage and TG be balanced  by big heavy hits at a haste penalty
[5:25:11] sshadeh: @Unlucki_1s dont think so, but some 2h weapons are smaller than some 1h weapons
[5:25:11] paulaodoveneno: i dont like making combo points, also hate aoe of rogue assas @sshadeh
[5:25:11] iceproxx: wtf are these talent why are they giving my spells i already had before but now i have to pick them in talents i dont get it
[5:25:20] Sollice: Should be. Higher rate of attack speed
[5:25:21] scumlucki: @Unlucki_1s which is weird
[5:25:24] sshadeh: @paulaodoveneno feral DH?

[5:26:17] scumlucki: i love the lava effects it looks like a real ornagy tomato soup
[5:26:20] sshadeh: i like titans grip and going for the biggest 2h weapons i can find
[5:26:24] Sollice: @Myathe Yeah. The shades of green arent very seperated
[5:26:25] GamingDad77: SMF..."swinging faster" but at the cost of half the damage
[5:26:26] sshadeh: cause no other spec in the game can do that
[5:26:28] ashes_234: Btw towellie, you want to enrage first then use your big cds
[5:26:50] llNoTToXiCll: smf was better for pvp wasnt it
[5:26:55] Molvonos: @Towelliee Which highlight you need from yesterday?  I just got home and can check real fast.

[5:30:03] PvtHudson093: If you play Worgen, does that mean your a Furry Warrior
[5:30:05] SaDos: oh there it is
[5:30:21] GamingDad77: @PvtHudson093 stop it
[5:30:35] Squats3: BT fucking claps
[5:30:47] Silverwards: @PvtHudson093 halt
[5:30:48] sshadeh: whirlwind is what enables you to AoE with rampage etc
[5:31:03] jetributions: same guy in orgrimmar has been dead for 4 hours

[5:41:37] SaDos: you have 50% from talents if you get 20% from items its more than enough
[5:41:38] BinaryBush: lol I meant because you're playing in the dark
[5:41:41] Squats3: @Towelliee with blood craze you will have a 50% chance to crit with  BT
[5:41:42] SaDos: +20 % from reck

[5:44:06] paulaodoveneno: thats what im talking about
[5:44:31] paulaodoveneno: dont forget to use bloodthirst to keep the haste buff
[5:45:02] enderlol: SMF pumping
[5:45:45] Squats3: I feel like you just never hit raging blow with this build. logs will tell though.
[5:45:46] KingWrightDev: how's df overall?
[5:45:48] Hammerofthur: heard prot is broken overtuned, have you dont any tanking yet?
[5:45:54] AinaTan3: the base UI is bad to track these mechanics
[5:46:48] GamingDad77: you wanted whelps....there you go
[5:46:48] SpoofAvatar: healer got deleted
[5:47:06] SLoPPYALieN: MANY WHELPS LEFT SIDE HANDLE IT!
[5:47:12] MOLAR305: @Towelliee any chance wrathion is the big baddied this XPAC
[5:47:14] SpoofAvatar: thats a 50 dkp minus

[5:48:44] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK LAUNCH! Marathon from Sept 26th - October 1st! This won't be like TBC Launch. Since this launches around DF Beta and DF Launch. We will still no life it and get Pre-Raid BiS. I AM PLAYING ON FRESH!
[5:49:08] Molvonos: The Infinite aren't brainless minions like a lot of the old Black Dragonflight were
[5:49:11] kokochris: im glad we are back to lore around dragons.  ZM lore really killed shadowlands for me
[5:49:27] Velashen: Blizzard storytelling can go literally anywhere. I wouldn’t count any crazy shit out.
[5:49:31] Mecabeast: I wonder if that quest line is like the bloodgate one in bfa where you were supposed to be max lvl going into it?
[5:49:39] Rindelin: @Towelliee is this the ingame music?
[5:49:45] kokochris: @Velashen lol true
[5:49:57] Quojin: @Rindelin no
[5:50:01] GamingDad77: Not to mention that Galagrond may possibly be ressurected...according to Bellulars video
[5:50:18] lordofmadness: @GamingDad77 Galakrond
[5:50:22] Molvonos: @GamingDad77 towNotwo towNo
[5:50:40] GamingDad77: @GamingDad77 i'm not the best in typing  lol
[5:50:56] draxioxx: DRAGONFLIGHT ROCKS
[5:51:11] thenormalbeast: So is Warrior Pumping?
[5:51:13] Mecabeast: I thought infinite was just corrupted bronze?
[5:51:32] Sollice: I dont think he needs to be rezed. You have Chromie that can take you back to the aspect flights against him which would be amazing. And you could make something different for the end game boss of DF
[5:51:33] lordofmadness: Hard to make dragons uninteresting. They will have to try to ruin it. Which, they definitely could.
[5:51:53] ArcaneMaki: Shit wizard Khadgar might end up White Dragonflight leader. @Towelliee
[5:52:03] Sollice: What, he isnt a dragon
[5:52:05] V4NDEL: warrior is looking so good
[5:52:06] Sollice: Why would he lead it
[5:52:19] GamingDad77: @Sollice but its still a possibility
[5:52:32] ArcaneMaki: That was obviously a joke XD
[5:52:36] SpoofAvatar: knowledge is power
[5:52:38] thenormalbeast: Warrior seems the same, swapped Avatar with Bladestorm
[5:52:39] BigHeroSixy: Hes been a dragon the whole time Pog
[5:52:43] Molvonos: Khadgarizardormu
[5:52:48] Scarhearth: that would be the largest retcon to ever exist
[5:52:51] Sollice: We dont have any colors that would make white
[5:52:54] Snabido: We're alk dragons all along
[5:52:56] draxioxx: REKT D=
[5:52:56] Molvonos: "KHADGAR, I HAVE COME TO BARGIN."
[5:52:59] FleuryGG: literally rolled
[5:53:00] strike879: he wanted guldans skull for a snack
[5:53:00] ArcaneMaki: Yeah we just don't know yet, but he's been a dragon this whole time
[5:53:01] 91Niki: He’s literally turns into a raven. Why would he lead LUL
[5:53:02] Sollice: Unless, mass orgy of dragons and they mix all colors and make a white
[5:53:03] Mamiwata: that was reckless Kappa
[5:53:07] lordofmadness: There is no white dragonflight in WoW
[5:53:14] Mecabeast: I hope we get some random dreadlords exposed and some mention to sire
[5:53:14] Molvonos: @Sollice towLewd
[5:53:15] Intikamcy: Khadgrlgrlgrl
[5:53:18] Proto_Paradigm: Didn't they make Thrall the Aspect of Earth with the Dragon Soul for a short time?
[5:53:30] Chonkehmangz: Just got in here. How does prot feel at the moment? 👀👀
[5:53:31] duhworks: kadgar is a dragon?!?!
[5:53:33] Lamyth: khadgar is clearly half-dragon, half-murloc, half-dreadlord
[5:53:35] sshadeh: khadgars dad was a mage hungry for dragonussy
[5:53:35] GamingDad77: @lordofmadness not yet
[5:53:36] thagalvir: he travels as a bird right? with atiesh but he had dragonform in his backpocket?
[5:53:37] sshadeh: Kappa
[5:53:37] Roboboooty: @towelliee if you pick Rend as fury, does it apply to multiple targets after whirlwind?
[5:53:37] BigHeroSixy: PogChamp Storytime with Towelliee
[5:53:42] SpoofAvatar: Khadragon
[5:53:47] ArcaneMaki: Sorry, what did I started!?!
[5:53:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: imagine being a dragon but turning into a fucking crow when you fly anywhere
[5:53:56] Dstelljr: Sylvannas leader of white dragon flight! Forsaken dragons lol
[5:53:59] llNoTToXiCll: is Smf doing alright?
[5:53:59] maskedboy999: dungeon LOOks nice
[5:54:05] cinnamints: Nah, just tie it to the guardians. Wouldn't be a big deal. Would explain why he's so weird, honestly.
[5:54:10] TheZofren: where tf is khadgar
[5:54:13] lordofmadness: @HaxzorJimDuggan maybe he meant to keep his true form secret.
[5:54:17] calcutr0n: i thought just thunderclap
[5:54:24] Scarhearth: whirlwind cleaves anything thats single target so id imagine it would
[5:54:31] Chonkehmangz: Khadgar’s father was a chicken from westfall and his mother was a black dragon. Hence the raven form.
[5:54:35] ArcaneMaki: But still, yeah where the F is Khadgar.
[5:54:36] norther456: it doesnt spread rent
[5:54:37] Sollice: He becomes the leader and all of the dragons have gar at the end of their names
[5:54:37] rbailey_2222: that dragon looks sick
[5:54:53] Mecabeast: think he means if you have the whirlwind buff will rend apply to multiple targets when you press it
[5:54:58] ArcaneMaki: Shit Wizard Khadragon
[5:55:11] Xailen: That dragon needs to be a mount.
[5:55:14] sshadeh: @Sollice Alexstraszagar
[5:55:33] Gezber: EZ
[5:55:39] Chonkehmangz: Can you spell reflect it?
[5:55:45] Skittlebeast: that dragon is best pixels in the game
[5:55:49] Roboboooty: @mecabeast yes
[5:56:14] hugosilva: NotLikeThis
[5:56:17] thagalvir: slam
[5:56:27] yuca247n: exactly, so now u can take what you actually want/use
[5:56:27] hugosilva: towCopium
[5:56:41] Roaringkittylol: They need to prune again. Just feels like they did it because the pro's were whining about not enoug buttons
[5:56:46] Reckless_Monk: ??
[5:56:48] Reckless_Monk: fr
[5:56:51] Chonkehmangz: How does prot feel by the way? Just got in here lol
[5:56:54] draxioxx: wtf
[5:56:56] ArcaneMaki: I can't wait for Drgonflight pre-patch day and be like, alright icy-veins.com, apply cookie cutter build, alright I'm done
[5:57:07] Molvonos: Three sunders man, three sunders
[5:57:17] dldrzoidberg: on live spell reflection reduces magic damage by 20% so you use it without needing to spell reflect
[5:57:19] draxioxx: he though the fire heals Kappa
[5:57:30] Mamiwata: what's happening is you're more than 25y from your dragon healer >>
[5:57:32] strike879: what happened was health hit 0%
[5:57:40] SpoofAvatar: need more Fire Resist
[5:58:04] teal7silence: #evokerto40yards
[5:58:36] GriffGoodman: that dragon would make a nice mount
[5:58:37] hugosilva: towCopium towCopium
[5:58:57] duhworks: fuck just make it a melee
[5:59:09] feninr: agi
[5:59:14] Mamiwata: should put a mark on the healer to stay close to him easie
[5:59:14] teal7silence: I mean, they designed it that way, but honestly there was literally no such thing as a "mid range class" until now
[5:59:15] Squats3: watch towelliee be on top even thoug he was dead\
[5:59:21] baZleicious: evoker mobility makes up for range issues. Can't make every class good at everything
[5:59:22] scumlucki: thats fucking sick

[5:59:52] Cordrann: you shouldn't have been able to loot that, sounds like a bug
[5:59:59] Chonkehmangz: Blood elf DK with heritage armor would be amazing looking with that.

[6:01:30] HAMMERRAZOR: titan grip sorry
[6:01:35] ArcaneMaki: he knows
[6:01:37] Aquadriel: SMG was literally cause some warriors wanted to transmog small swords lol. theres NOTHING ELSE to it.

[6:03:03] Chonkehmangz: Tbh if I used SMF, I’d just use the fist of the diety with mongoose enchants.
[6:03:05] HAMMERRAZOR: whats going to do more damage in reality 2 BIG MASSIVE SWORDS or 2 baby swords?
[6:03:11] Dinermoe: imagine both being viable for different content and you have to farm and maintain 4 weapons KEKW
[6:03:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: i could go for a lambo
[6:03:27] cinnamints: I enjoy transmog, but nothing's better than being able to dual wield 2H.
[6:03:36] Cordrann: worgen fury with fist weapons looks pretty cool tbh
[6:03:40] thenormalbeast: Have you tried arms?

[6:04:47] HAMMERRAZOR: but you know what sucked in shadowlands with fury warrior is when you wanted to pick your vault, you had to pick arms as a fury warrior so that you didnt get one handed weapons, it triggered the hell out of me opening it and seeing that sinsmasher
[6:04:53] Kasvot_Vaxt: lmao
[6:04:56] baZleicious: 8 ads. Is this cable TV?
[6:05:03] stallowned: lol

[6:05:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: we need a pet with big ass wheels in the front and back but runs on all four legs Kappa
[6:05:40] Dinermoe: @HAMMERRAZOR just dont touch the loot spec KEKW
[6:05:49] Squats3: @Aquadriel probably. pet battles are oddly large for the game. its like a silent majority.
[6:06:00] HAMMERRAZOR: @Dinermoe i play hunter and demon hunter so my warrior can sit out for now KEKW
[6:06:25] Dinermoe: @HAMMERRAZOR ouh. Sadge
[6:06:27] Finghin26: REFLECT
[6:06:28] mashiesmashie: I miss 10 man mythic
[6:06:31] HAMMERRAZOR: dude i just tried soar on evoker and it sucks now 540% doesnt feel the same
[6:06:40] Squats3: @Towelliee 10 man mythic would be cool. but i remember when 10/25 were both offered for heroic and the tuning was just all over the place. so sticking to 20 man is probably for the best.
[6:06:52] Dinermoe: dude max rage quit the stream the other day after he tried it after fated nathria KEKW
[6:07:19] Dinermoe: spells?
[6:07:23] Squats3: @Dinermoe rage quit what
[6:07:24] Dinermoe: can be hidden op

[6:08:22] Solaris_Chi: New talent trees remind me of POE. Am I wrong to think that?
[6:08:44] Squats3: @Rudric_Ice If its more damage than BT it might be okay. Replace BT with onslaught when youre already enraged
[6:08:49] cahoots82: Remind you of PoE how? In that they're both trees sort of?

[6:10:26] ShrenTheOrc: vulpera dont have a city right?

[6:15:07] Lostdogal: MacBook Pro works fine, used to play on one few years ago, playing across both an iMac and pc right now and both perform pretty much the same.

[6:29:37] TheRavenGrave: He Is The One That Sent You On That Quest To Stop Himself so I Underststand
[6:29:41] KillForPancakes: His bones are missing from Northrend in retail right now
[6:29:42] saevenar: his curse was to know his fate despite being able to traverse all time. eventually he would succumb to madness
[6:29:44] Dankind64: 100% for sure we do. That's the only reason to add Rafaam to the game (from hearthstone)
[6:29:48] Thills_: isnt he dead so how would that be possible
[6:30:02] Molvonos: @Dankind64 They can be adding Rafaam for other reasons
[6:30:32] nytebaba: Galakron better be a full size raid, not just a boss. It'd be either great or terrible
[6:30:32] GamingDad77: @KillForPancakes makes you wonder who has them now
[6:30:32] ArcaneMaki: Hopefully we don't fight a tentacles Galakron...
[6:30:35] KillForPancakes: His bones + Rafaam datamined
[6:30:47] Biorrwolf: This xpac already seems full of wibbly wobbly timey wimey...stuff
[6:30:51] Brodih_: Tiamat monkaS
[6:30:51] Dohla: i think we will face gala in some caverns of time setting
[6:30:55] KillForPancakes: @KillForPancakes Exactly, could be a cool story
[6:30:57] Thills_: galakron is dead so we wont be seeing him so someone else thats big
[6:31:03] AmZambie: Ive got it infinite flight brings galacron from another time line galacron kills Murozond and now we have to kill a version of galacron
[6:31:13] DevilSpire: All I know is there better not be another spine type fight
[6:31:18] Seerated: Yea, htbox representative of each ones influence maybe. Noz was the only one you could interract with
[6:31:25] mashiesmashie: they were waiting for technology to develop

[6:32:01] weekend_warrior_dave: they revived onyxia after years so why not another dead dragon
[6:32:05] Sollice: Sorry. i think going back in time and playing as a drake with the aspect drakes in a huge sky battle would be awesome
[6:32:05] Utmost777: i hope they don't try to pull more timeline junk like that with the main story
[6:32:11] Utmost777: keep it in side quests
[6:32:16] Biorrwolf: So who's above the Jailer in the hierarchy of ultimate powers?
[6:32:20] Sollice: The story on how he was defeated is already there and it has great potential
[6:32:34] KillForPancakes: monkaS
[6:32:51] scumlucki: @Biorrwolf the jailor didnt tell us so we dont know
[6:33:04] foofighters182: in between state PogChamp
[6:33:07] daddydillyy: how do you feel about fury warrior so far?
[6:33:19] KillForPancakes: So he's just stuck in purgatory right now?

[6:34:08] Biorrwolf: We're gonna have to kill Sargeras fully at some point

[6:36:40] armidell518815: reduces by a negative????? UH oh
[6:36:43] drewsky96: so it.. increases damage taken?
[6:36:47] Molvonos: So casting Moonfire makes the enemies hit you harder, what
