[0:33:47] AeonianSpirit: yeah I have no idea what is happening lol, I feel like when I started ffxiv and saw savage for the first time
[0:34:26] RasnerG: is not that hard to understand tbh
[0:34:35] RasnerG: is just your eye isn trained to see what is happening xD
[0:38:59] RasnerG: 7 more
[0:40:32] AeonianSpirit: lol
[0:44:09] RasnerG: tbh when i appear on the search it say im from mex while im not XD
[0:44:25] RasnerG: they buffed ret like 20%
[0:45:40] asmodai4823: they were weak in raid
[0:45:59] asmodai4823: the buffs were to all the bottom specs in raid
[0:47:15] AeonianSpirit: If I wanted to try wow are there classes that are kinda similar to blm, rdm that I would enjoy? I play casters primarily
[0:47:56] LeighFarris: Arcane Mage is kinda similar to BLM
[0:48:14] LeighFarris: Destruction Warlock is also similar.
[0:48:22] Smol_Alicel: Which of the DK's would you say is good to start on as a newbie
[0:48:31] LeighFarris: Arcane mage plays around spending mana then regenerating it.
[0:48:42] AeonianSpirit: cool, I'll keep that in mind. thanks
[0:48:46] LeighFarris: Destruction Warlock is similar if you like to be a turret that hits big
[0:48:52] AeonianSpirit: oh ok
[0:49:10] asmodai4823: melee GIGACHAD
[0:49:20] LeighFarris: Demonology warlock is also interesting. It's more like SMN, but you summon ALL the things at the same time. lol
[0:49:30] Smol_Alicel: Sadge rip, dk looks cool tho

[0:53:20] LeighFarris: DK is good in raid right now
[0:53:56] LeighFarris: It's just a bit squishy at the beginning of a pull in mythic+
[0:55:04] Smol_Alicel: I appreciate the answers, I'll see what i'll do Bugcatapproving
[0:55:48] LeighFarris: It reduces damage and healing on mobs
[0:58:17] StreamStickers: Get in on the action by slapping a Stream Sticker! Type !stickers to learn how.
[0:58:30] Smol_Alicel: yea that's understandable, i've just never been a fan of ranged character, but i see what you mean, i'll try it out to learn the game first before i dive into other classes
[1:00:59] Smol_Alicel: gotcha, once again, i appreciate the feedback
[1:01:19] LeighFarris: Well, while that's kinda true, most classes have multiple specs and at least one of those specs is viable
[1:01:44] LeighFarris: For example mage has 3 DPS specs, and mage has never been bad because at least 1 spec (usually fire) is "king".
[1:02:12] LeighFarris: Mage, rogue and warlock are safe picks because of that.
[1:03:17] Sebbywebz: Arthas dawg are you gonna play SOD? sebbyCat
[1:04:22] Sebbywebz: also hola sebbyB
[1:04:57] LeighFarris: You can either skip the first pack in the first room, or skip the mobs in the tunnel you're in right now

[1:05:35] Sebbywebz: Phase 2 gonna be BIG
[1:05:54] LeighFarris: My mage is still 14 in SOD Lol
[1:18:00] RasnerG: yep idk what wowhead says

[4:17:01] wynterdream: strummer, i got an honest question: why you don't want waifu to start from first tier? Okaymage is doing that, seems like a good idea?
[4:17:25] Baf0: everytime we did E4N she got hit by the first moving aoe
[4:17:40] JedexGT: is this the current top raid?

[4:18:23] Baf0: don't make it min ilvl
[4:18:50] Baf0: she got to learn LC in P2S
[4:19:00] wynterdream: but maybe she can learn the basics, foundation of her class from previous tiers? bc if she go into p10s now, it might be a bit rough
[4:20:13] wynterdream: min ilevel, those other party members for Okaymage were struggling, even those who had done it before
[4:20:33] wynterdream: YEP
[4:20:38] Antiv1rus: @Baf0 we can consider doing ShB weapons trial as well, emerald for spinning, diamond for LC and such
[4:20:45] wynterdream: no, i think she's insanely good. way better than in BLM KEKW
[4:20:52] wynterdream: way better than you
[4:21:04] Baf0: @Antiv1rus yeah she should unlock all of that

[4:22:43] Daletheawesome: i love your thoughts on the difficulty  curve in ff14. my first raid tier was p9-12s and p10s was insanely brutal
[4:22:58] metavahn231: xiv players are pampered by stories and graphics
[4:22:59] Baf0: P10S is harder than uwu/ucob
[4:23:13] metavahn231: the hardest thing they do is rabanastre 24 man KEKW
[4:23:17] wynterdream: so what do you plan for waifu after p9s?
[4:23:17] Daletheawesome: p10s was an amazing fight yes
[4:23:18] tigerrsz: peepoTalk
[4:23:27] wynterdream: more extremes?
[4:24:06] Baf0: first expansion turn 1 is always more or less an EX
[4:24:13] wynterdream: ic....
[4:24:16] Antiv1rus: @bluecesti rabanananana city people not clicking on Dark Circle Aware
[4:24:17] wynterdream: yeah

[4:31:16] wynterdream: HYPERPOGGER
[4:35:49] Baf0: Calls for a FF6 remake are difficult to respond to, the series’ brand manager has said, because he believes such a project would take roughly twice as long as it has to remake Final Fantasy 7.
[4:35:55] Baf0: peepoSad
[4:36:26] Baf0: yeah it's massive
[4:36:34] Baf0: honestly I think it doesn't need it as much as FF7

[5:02:00] Baf0: if your videos are labelled Part 1, Part 2, Part 3.... people don't click because they think they HAVE to watch the other videos
[5:02:13] Baf0: so generally youtubers don't add that to their titles
[5:02:30] absolutedrivel: really?  seems like a good take
[5:02:33] wynterdream: xdding
[5:02:33] SetsYouFree: Me when I first did savage "wtf is addle"
[5:03:22] Baf0: they watched the first few seconds and commented

[5:19:26] Baf0: I meant their editors
[5:19:27] Baf0: not them
[5:19:49] Baf0: Aris doesn't take anything from his editor, he just tells him do whatever you want
[5:19:56] Baf0: they are part of it
[5:20:24] Baf0: true
[5:20:36] Baf0: that's why it's harder for smaller channels
[5:21:05] Baf0: Asmon doesn't even do sponsored inserts
