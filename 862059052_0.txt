[2:09:40] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Cypfer Becasue if you have gear lower than 207 item level, world boss drops 207 gear. It makes sense if you loot the WB first before the GV since you could possbily have the same type of gear but another piece could use the higher ilvl on your toon.
[2:09:45] pavepawns: NA more like Nah fuck that
[2:09:45] KonradGM: ok eu bros, we need to bribe him with something to get him to 60, i can only get some fancy Polish beers Kappa

[2:14:12] Xepiii: how you handle tanking destroyer hc on your brew? Im 201 is that too llow for hc destroyer?
[2:14:38] KonradGM: hitting 1.4k you just need to know what goes well with your speca nd be lucky in lfg, its the 1.6 and 1.8k that is borderline impossible in pugs / if you're not a streamer :/
[2:14:44] Loktharok: how much haste do you want as a brew?

[2:16:01] Melgor101: manSUN
[2:16:09] VonicVS: it counts most of em. if it doesnt it will let you know
[2:16:10] Alaquane: it does compare abilities
[2:16:19] PokerFaceMoose: it legit predicts how much hp your companions will have after
[2:16:22] mightygerm1: venture plan is the besto ne
[2:16:24] TrowGundam: It counts most abilities, it is only missing some of the newer companions that just unlocked last week
[2:16:27] TrowGundam: Like Croman
[2:16:45] Alaquane: I knew I forgot to do something this week
[2:16:51] Alaquane: rip croman

[2:17:14] CDubTheRIPper: did you end up getting him?
[2:17:15] rohdey: my cro is 20
[2:17:23] othraerir: haven';t had any xp quest for him, and i only got him when you did
[2:17:24] TrowGundam: Croman and the latest Renown one is the only companions I've seen where it doesn't know the abilities
[2:17:27] WhiteKnight74648: love this song. actually did a waltz to this song at my studio :-)

[2:17:59] rohdey: anyone have more than 10 companions rn?
[2:18:06] Tealkan: The Necrolord units are insanely good. Melee hit all frontline and ranged hit all backline. Kyrian are useless...
[2:18:12] Lincoln_WoW: just do an ulduar
[2:18:17] pavepawns: night fae and necro are strongest
[2:18:19] thebakeriscomingforu: bring two unholy dks
[2:18:38] pavepawns: why stop at only 2 dks?
[2:18:46] pavepawns: 3 or 4 or maybe even 20
[2:18:50] pereadin: All you need in life is UH DK's
[2:18:51] hagmania: you can get mounts? wtf
[2:18:54] BlinkHeals: @Towelliee your a streamer you will be carried through mythics right after you hit 60

[2:21:20] pavepawns: i havent done lfr in so long
[2:21:22] nixxy_7: its gonan be weird bc they didnt release the bosses in the order they are
[2:21:30] TrowGundam: Too bad it will only be 3 more bosses so we still won't get Tier 3 in the vault this week
[2:21:33] CDubTheRIPper: still 187 FeelsBadMan
[2:21:33] maardal: Yeah, last wing opens around mid feb haha
[2:21:36] swordart_19: Lfr was opening later always
[2:21:36] TheRiwen: people stil do lfr ?
[2:21:37] TrowGundam: Tier 2*
[2:21:42] Sandisy: morons at blizz. your covenant gear is higher ilvl starting this week is it not?
[2:21:46] RunningOutOfRAM: How Much do you think I should pay for LFR Boost ?
[2:21:58] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning Hammer Squad!
[2:21:58] pavepawns: its a very tuned and scripted first raid we got but i do enjoy castle nathria
[2:22:00] nixxy_7: lool
[2:22:01] Thoreya: lfr boost mannn
[2:22:03] Rimstar: currently stuck at council heroic lmao
[2:22:05] d1stract10n: you have my sub carry me
[2:22:08] UHStorm: oh man sludgefist chains in front LUL
[2:22:15] Stonefather: LFR harder than normal and heroic danO

[2:22:40] pavepawns: i suggest niklaus
[2:22:44] slipper14: literally one shot H council in a 15 man pug
[2:22:46] sharie: Council of Blood is my Favorite Boss in Castle Nathria
[2:22:51] Rimstar: lady @pavepawns
[2:22:53] slipper14: one of the easiest heroic bosses
[2:23:05] Amarlian: Towelliee cannot be bought! He can be bribed for short periods of time if the price is right though.
[2:23:14] Ipakk: yeah lots of ppl die to stravos
[2:23:15] Evilseyes00: Yea Nik first frieda last my guild 2 shot it our first time
[2:23:16] OnceAMoose: I raid lead a smaller guild group, usually a 2/3/9 setup and we finally killed normal sludgedick last night, then one shot generals, and 6 shot Sire to round out the night.
[2:23:16] CritcobainTV: We did stavros niklaus and then freida. freida is super simple at the end as long as people move out of the shit on the ground
[2:23:26] Stonefather: My guild does Niklaus John Stamos and then Frieda
[2:23:31] Lazugo: nik-stravaus-frieda
[2:23:32] Firelordxsrx: What should be your average dps for heroic?
[2:23:35] reydentv: what are this weeks affixes?

[2:23:47] pavepawns: niklaus is easiest for last especially if you got enough tranq power
[2:23:49] nixxy_7: Recital
[2:23:53] d1stract10n: the dancer coming from the ceiling stop
[2:23:53] Rimstar: recital which seems to be screwing my guild over atm
[2:23:56] Crohnnn: aprtner thingy
[2:24:13] railroad10989: this week chat or @Towelliee should we focus more on aoe talents or ST for keys?
[2:24:17] CritcobainTV: @Rimstar I'd try stavros niklaus ans freida, just make sure that you move out of the shit on the ground with freida
[2:24:21] StateFarm206: Cant wait to watch people die in lfr to dancing KEKW
[2:24:26] swordart_19: All good people do PvP instead
[2:24:28] KonradGM: dunno but Pugging feels terrible in Shadowlands
[2:24:33] niekp89: what
[2:24:35] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[2:24:36] Stonefather: How danS
[2:24:39] rohdey: well you are mythic geared
[2:24:39] CritcobainTV: PogChamp nerf Brewmaster
[2:24:54] metavahn231: yeah you might want to do that
[2:25:03] abbosss: your monk is also geared to the tooth and it was probably an alt group KEKW
[2:25:05] rbailey_2222: rbailey_2222 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[2:25:08] rohdey: ooooooh yeah
[2:25:17] rohdey: that what bottom dps should be lol
[2:25:29] swordart_19: All good just do PvP better gear , more fun for some :P
[2:25:33] laaxxxd: when is the valut opning :)
[2:25:38] Firelordxsrx: What ilvl is good for Heroic?
[2:25:38] luckfore: the gearing system sucks
[2:25:46] TrowGundam: PUGing always sucks at the beginning of a tier
[2:26:00] madmat93: is 187 ilvl frost mage dps ok for normal pugs ?
[2:26:02] TheSteve: you gotta keep em separated
[2:26:03] NILLme: get better or stay low
[2:26:07] Thoreya: until u git gud
[2:26:12] PHaRTnONu: @Towelliee What was the addon/(or) WA u were talking about for mission tables?
[2:26:12] hobano890: playing affl lock but I feel useless in m+
[2:26:14] hdmoonlol: That is how it SHOULD be
[2:26:17] smoketrayne: Yo anyone getting this bug where you cant verify your account and login?
[2:26:24] Belirs: i think hc guilds having something to progress is a wonderfull thing to get people used to harder content like mythic :)
[2:26:26] slipper14: @hobano890 What keys are pushing? Affli is good at like 14+
[2:26:29] Lillbebis: Lillbebis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[2:26:41] Wildside1177: You are describing my guild perfectly.
[2:26:41] Tobizh: tbh loving this gearing system, i really dont mind staying at 200 ilvl for now :P
[2:26:41] Krigsgurun: what he did get from vault?
[2:26:50] hobano890: @slipper14 lower ones like anything from 1-8 I just have horrendous dps cause encounters are so short, so I cant gear up easy
[2:26:56] swordart_19: No all good just do PvP instead of m+ and raid
[2:27:02] NILLme: they should add valor vendor
[2:27:06] Lynxide: LOL, agree
[2:27:06] Wildside1177: I do most things with iLvl 200 and I still have a 171 hat. So frustrating.
[2:27:08] GermanBacon: wait... is this EU?
[2:27:08] Thoreya: well see if the sub numbers drop
[2:27:08] nixxy_7: trueeee
[2:27:10] d1stract10n: im a blood dk with 200 ilvl and i am currently on stone legion
[2:27:10] Thoreya: if not keep it
[2:27:10] moejimbo: Give me tbc tokens or something!
[2:27:15] Belirs: getting sick loot after getting nothing for 2 weeks feels dope
[2:27:16] luckfore: Ulduar timewalking felt so good
[2:27:17] swordart_19: I do PvP 4Head
[2:27:20] luckfore: compared to Nathria
[2:27:20] Kromede: towIgnit
[2:27:22] slipper14: @hobano890 yea affli isn't great at those levels, fortified should help tho
[2:27:23] metavahn231: its boring to only get good gear from the vault and nothing else
[2:27:25] CritcobainTV: I like the fact that the game is hard, but at the same time I REALLY need to find a guild that can clear heroic and start working on mythic
[2:27:26] Vivelli: so do you think they should bring back warforging (up to a max of 213?) to help those lower tier players
[2:27:26] TrowGundam: One of the problems is there isn't a fall back mechanic. Back in BC, yes loot was like this, but you have points you got to buy gear eventually. You need that fallback system
[2:27:28] Bugszy: it will kill this game more cause you have more perecentage of people that are not mythic raiders to those who do so they only satisfying a small amount of people
[2:27:28] swordart_19: and iam casual and i have 200 item lvl from vendor next week 4Head
[2:27:29] Rimstar: ilvl 205, ive just accepted im not going up from that tbh
[2:27:30] Krigsgurun: Chat what did he get from vault?
[2:27:34] I_DoctorSatan_I: well, I dont PvP nor am I interested in Raiding right now...so, my x3 220 every week is all i got going for me. I'm ok with that at ilvl 207.
[2:27:36] Thoreya: well see if the sub numbers drop
[2:27:38] vansenthelock: needs something like a badge vendor to help make it better its too shitty atm
[2:27:39] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee they should add more loot in CN for Normal/Heroic like for mythic it is fine
[2:27:41] marty1g_: Playing 10 hours a day is not average? What am I doing wrong
[2:27:43] nielefs: 210 ivl from a M15 is stupid imo
[2:27:43] Wulfenst: Wulfenst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! Several of our raiders including myself havent gotten loot at all from the last 3 weeks of raid. Its actually rediculous.
[2:27:44] Omegacloud: try to gear your 2nd or 3rd char in pugs ^^
[2:27:46] dozilla: that's how i vote too Tow, good point
[2:27:46] Darthyrevan: i like it, bfa loot as too much
[2:27:46] swordart_19: You get 200 ITEM LVL from Covenant campaing and unrated PVP Just stop whining KEKW
[2:27:59] Naturalbeef: I'd rather farm gear than AP. That was our choice
[2:27:59] piratechris: It's weird that they took such a huge step back in time. It's not as bad as it was to start for this game but it certainly is a very odd design decision on Blizzards part. Quite the gamble one might even say.
[2:28:00] hobano890: @slipper14 alright thanks, just making sure its not just because i'm bad, i'm at 193 ilvl so expected more

[2:28:15] Belirs: CouldYouNot what do you mean the gear catch up is pvp ?
[2:28:17] CritcobainTV: @swordart_19 uh, he 200 pieces are from conquest, which is rated pvp LUL
[2:28:18] Undying_faith: Yea when i wake up in mornings i like doing low low keys to help people out if need be it's fun to me plus DE mats ftw
[2:28:21] AgentWhiskeyy: It‚Äôs definitely true
[2:28:24] Cypfer: +15 for a chance of 210ilvl gear is BS tbh LUL
[2:28:28] mrniceguy817: @i_doctorsatan_i How are you getting 3x 220 pieces a week then?
[2:28:29] AgentWhiskeyy: People are so stuck up on Item level
[2:28:32] d1stract10n: @Towelliee but the cut scene is worth it
[2:28:32] SpicyFeta: It is true the average player if you just do pvp it takes a while to gear
[2:28:32] Ezekyler: best quest
[2:28:34] Wildside1177: @swordart_19 And we are sick of people like you
[2:28:34] swordart_19: @critcobain so do rated pvp 4Head next week you get better gear.
[2:28:38] zinbers: This expansion is not alt friendly at all for a causal player it sucks my friend did two raids in two weeks and did not see a single peices of gear that was for his spec
[2:28:40] AgentWhiskeyy: That low level people don‚Äôt even get a chance to get their items
[2:28:42] MugginsTV: wise words as always.
[2:28:43] CritcobainTV: @swordart_19 but what you said is wrong. soooo
[2:28:43] nixxy_7: Correct !!
[2:28:45] othraerir: screw pvp
[2:28:45] bad_fish_too: Im at 204 and I'm pretty sure I'm stuck there for a while.
[2:28:47] swordart_19: That is working gearing system
[2:28:47] shwa1g: The reality is the game feels better when you overcome a hardship. long grind, tough boss, pvp struggle. handing out gear makes idiots stick around and then dedicated players burn out and theyre your real $ makers
[2:28:48] Belirs: BRING BACK CONQUEST VENDOR POGGERS
[2:28:52] sharie: pls Save us Ion
[2:28:53] AgentWhiskeyy: And what‚Äôs worse is you can do 40 mins of 1 mythic
[2:28:53] TrowGundam: If gear "catch up" is PvP, FUCK THAT. I dont' do PvP, I DESPISE PvP. That part of the game minds well just not exist to me.
[2:28:57] AgentWhiskeyy: And you don‚Äôt even get gear
[2:28:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: @mrniceguy817 x3 220 "choices" from GV. I should of been clear.
[2:29:00] swordart_19: @critcobain how it is wrong that is fact
[2:29:02] pereadin: I still stand by +20's and higher dropping 233+ gear and 15's dropping 216 gear.
[2:29:02] Kromede: smart system Kappa
[2:29:02] AgentWhiskeyy: Like you can spend a whole day
[2:29:05] metavahn231: 10+ does take skill and the gear is shit
[2:29:06] AgentWhiskeyy: And not get any loot
[2:29:09] KonradGM: getting to 1.4k is easy as long as you have good comp, it's the 1.6 and 1.8 that made me want to uninstall teh fucking game LUL
[2:29:10] TMMOOF: I mean if its drops pvp only gear.. thats fine right? Not like raiding is better than pvp LUL
[2:29:17] RageerPLZ: @Towelliee this gear shortage is hurting our raid team, we were supposed to start mythic but everyone who didn't spam mythic+ or pvp is relying on heroic and getting nothing.
[2:29:19] Belirs: @pereadin that would destroy any reason for hc raids monkaS
[2:29:19] AgentWhiskeyy: People don‚Äôt like pvp
[2:29:21] Its_Me_MG: KEKW
[2:29:23] CDubTheRIPper: towBook
[2:29:25] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee been forced to play more casual this expansion and I can barely get into keys as a dps as is stuck doing heroics and pvp for gear.
[2:29:25] nixxy_7: MMORPG is not about PVP !! @Towelliee MMORPG is a complex unity of PVP+PVE+other stuff like worldmap world quests solos etc etc
[2:29:28] CritcobainTV: @swordart_19 you literally just said "you get 200 ilvl gear from unrated pvp" but its 184 ilvl from unrated pvp, and 200 from rated pvp. so that's COMPLETELY wrong
[2:29:29] Its_Me_MG: no worries just get Ted to kill him
[2:29:30] AgentWhiskeyy: You shouldn‚Äôt force players
[2:29:32] RobSaidOtis: im a fairly casual player and i dont think the gear is too had to get
[2:29:32] Vashile: The fact of the matter is a casual player is going to cap in ilvl at some point because they are not dong the content to get higher.
[2:29:34] AgentWhiskeyy: To play pvp to gear
[2:29:34] pereadin: @Belirs you can still do last 2 for 220 gear
[2:29:39] AgentWhiskeyy: When they just wanna raid and dungeon
[2:29:40] Redacted_: i dont care about doing keys as much now, i just try to get a high level done for the week
[2:29:42] Sirwaltz: lol it amazes me how people just totally ignore pvp
[2:29:47] swordart_19: @critcobain you get next week it ggoes up max honor lvl cap upgrade.
[2:29:47] AgentWhiskeyy: But blizzard is ridiculous
[2:29:51] nixxy_7: :O i know this one
[2:29:56] sharie: BibleThump
[2:29:58] idenkaz_: imo the best one so far
[2:29:58] D3m0nHunt3r666: spoilers
[2:29:59] AgentWhiskeyy: It‚Äôs not an ignore pvp
[2:30:00] Yarles: moonberry allied race when
[2:30:01] pereadin: @Belirs if you wanna get technical doing mythic raiding makes heroic obselete
[2:30:03] AgentWhiskeyy: But as a player
[2:30:03] luckfore: BibleThump
[2:30:04] MarquisLek: this one is good
[2:30:04] RobSaidOtis: the queen <3
[2:30:04] metavahn231: every WoW cinematic looks like some disney shit
[2:30:06] D3m0nHunt3r666: tastelessRage
[2:30:06] zinbers: The gearing system is sad they need to hot fix the current system it hard getting a goof pieces of system
[2:30:07] AgentWhiskeyy: We have an option don‚Äôt we
[2:30:09] SpectraBG: I love this cinematic
[2:30:10] Apokolipz: BibleThump
[2:30:10] acklesdh: PepeHands
[2:30:10] nixxy_7: @AgentWhiskeyy its not blizzard its activision... did youforget already? Blizzard was fired Activision owns 99.9% of the company its just by NAME
[2:30:10] maardal: Burn it! Burn it with fire
[2:30:12] AgentWhiskeyy: PVE
[2:30:14] swordart_19: just baddies in chat whining get good and do something you have already than enough gear from Covenant Campaingg and unrated pvp for what you are doing .
[2:30:14] rohdey: Eonar
[2:30:15] d1stract10n: elune
[2:30:15] othraerir: i love getting 1 shot in pvp
[2:30:15] AgentWhiskeyy: Or pvp
[2:30:16] zigzugg: it is elune
[2:30:16] CritcobainTV: so you're saying wait 2 weeks and then get 200 ilvl from unrated pvp. lol okay dude @swordart_19 makes sense
[2:30:17] Ertra: yeah, it's elune
[2:30:17] Voidheim: Emerald Drewam
[2:30:18] pereadin: @Belirs It'd just be a different way of achieving the same thing
[2:30:18] SpicyFeta: if you missed the first pump or group of players who did everything fast in the first two weeks you are a bit behind
[2:30:18] abbosss: elune
[2:30:18] RobSaidOtis: it is elune isnt it?
[2:30:21] Naturalbeef: Eonar
[2:30:21] Wulfenst: Elune/Eonar
[2:30:21] Boomhauwer: Elune
[2:30:21] torixar: speculated to be elune
[2:30:22] Ezekyler: Elune or Eonar
[2:30:22] Wildside1177: Eonar
[2:30:24] Kriven: Eonar
[2:30:25] Bashar_Strygar: Eonar
[2:30:25] TrowGundam: Do we even know?
[2:30:26] rohdey: Eonar made Ysera
[2:30:27] Gingerprimer: Eonar
[2:30:29] idenkaz_: Eonar most likely
[2:30:29] swordart_19: I did + 10 key with 180 healer yesterday timed EZ
[2:30:29] Nazz_1138: think Eonar
[2:30:30] othraerir: eonar i reckon
[2:30:32] AgentWhiskeyy: Don‚Äôt try and play the victim card for PVP when again it‚Äôs a choice in the game
[2:30:32] Lazugo: Eonar
[2:30:34] Frozen_DK: wtf i have never seen this cinematic
[2:30:35] I_DoctorSatan_I: Night Fae is not a sacrafical cult Kappa Kappa
[2:30:40] Veegore: Eonar, she's part of the pantheon
[2:30:42] Umulium_81: i dont understand why there is no pvp gear and pve gear seperately
[2:30:43] othraerir: elune is like the overgod i think
[2:30:46] Sirwaltz: exactly and people ignore pvp to just PVE. not a difficult concept
[2:30:47] CDubTheRIPper: of the light right?
[2:30:51] rohdey: @Towelliee pyromancer pointed out Eonar (summer queen) and ??? (winter queen)
[2:30:59] Redacted_: elune saved ysera so im guessing its her shes talking about
[2:30:59] Belirs: AngelThump
[2:31:00] nixxy_7: Yap because we are in a Pantheon of Death so next we might go in a Pantheon of Life next Expansion
[2:31:00] Wildside1177: I love how she gives of herself to help Ysera.
[2:31:01] Delicer1994: AngelThump
[2:31:01] GermanBacon: HYPERS AngelThump HYPERS
[2:31:02] MOLAR305: the entire council calls each other sister and brother. they called thr jailer brother before he snappwd

[2:31:12] Apokolipz: BibleThump
[2:31:13] SpectraBG: I love this
[2:31:13] FattBeard: Eonar and elune is their mom. At least that's Pyros thinking on it
[2:31:14] AgentWhiskeyy: What they should have is that if you strictly play one or the other there is better options to get more loot
[2:31:15] Belirs: nightbae AngelThump
[2:31:16] swordart_19: @critcobain 1 week you are so clueless it increases honor lvl gear upgrades based on Renown level which increases next week can upgrade Covenant gear set to 200 and unrated pvp to 200 you know nothing 0 idea arguign with someone who is culeless ape.
[2:31:17] GermanBacon: AngelThump

[2:31:55] GoGetItKo: I missed the escort music D:
[2:31:55] Sincline387: one of the most emotional for sure
[2:32:02] nixxy_7: the EGG that that druid was protecting in the animated 2d cinematic
[2:32:05] BublePye: Night Fae overall kinda has the best campaign (so far atleast)

[2:32:11] moonscryer: would of been funny for her to show up and eyues turn red and scream FOR THE LEGION.
[2:32:11] nixxy_7: URSOC demands JUSTICE
[2:32:11] Visinatrix: What professions are you running in SL?
[2:32:13] zigzugg: not as good as Illadins I AM MY SCARS Kappa
[2:32:14] moejimbo: I kinda dig how AW has become the "dragon" covenant not just the "furry" covenant
[2:32:21] idenkaz_: the buuld up to the cinematic was great
[2:32:21] slatester: meanwhile top pvpers got 233 weapons week 1
[2:32:27] GermanBacon: Ursoc PepeHands RIP spiky boi
[2:32:34] Belirs: still waiting for the day we get a ysera dragon flight mount :)
[2:32:37] pereadin: Wait I never saw that part of the cinematic
[2:32:44] yunggluten: @slatester if they get lucky
[2:32:44] Vivelli: xavius mode? she'd last a day before she died then Kappa
[2:32:47] Ezekyler: Night Bae best cinematic and Covenant quest intro AYAYA towPurple
[2:32:48] AgentWhiskeyy: I just think it‚Äôs corny people have pvp and pve armor
[2:32:56] nixxy_7: Justice to URSOC!! Ursoc may not be as important as ysera... to control a entire region like the Dreamland.... but URSOC was still important !! :( :(
[2:32:56] AgentWhiskeyy: Yet they don‚Äôt even actually play PVP
[2:33:00] CritcobainTV: Dungeons are WAY faster for leveling @Towelliee
[2:33:02] Its_Me_MG: Ysera eats the Winter Queen,as soon as she wakes, plot twist
[2:33:04] AgentWhiskeyy: They just do it for ‚Äúgear level‚Äù
[2:33:15] I_DoctorSatan_I: Night Fae: Well, we have a Bear here..(looks) no Dragon....Ysera I CHOOSE YOU!!
[2:33:17] szeeman62: szeeman62 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Keep it up happy new year and anniversary to you and lula!
[2:33:17] pereadin: I felt they did Ursoc dirty af
[2:33:38] TheRiwen: the casual will give up at some point
[2:33:42] slatester: @yunggluten yes, but pve players don't have the same chance without being the mythic endboss lol
[2:33:47] slatester: beating*
[2:33:48] Radmon1: Hi Towelliee and chat
[2:33:50] BlueBlurPrime: @Towelliee basically for alts, I am just gonna lvl them all to 60, then use the covenant armor and then just do callings, only enough time to play 2 chars atm
[2:33:51] pereadin: Bring 233 gear to +20's and 216 gear to +15's easy fix
[2:33:51] TrowGundam: #ReimplementJusticePoints
[2:33:53] zigzugg: why did they remove pvp only gear
[2:33:58] akia03: ya last 2 zones suck for xp
[2:33:59] brazkat: @Towelliee how do you feel about twisting i just love the idea in general
[2:34:00] vansenthelock: vendor is needed no doubt
[2:34:01] nixxy_7: @pereadin they wouldve killed ysera too if she wasnt of the Dreamer world, and that important for the realm ... ursoc had no leverage :( compared to YSERA to persuade the queen of his importance
[2:34:02] TrowGundam: Or Valor Points, taht works too
[2:34:06] Bugszy: @Towelliee your spot on 100% its going to get bad
[2:34:14] PattyPoo13: I only played towards the end of BFA but isnt this the same way gear drop worked then minus the pvp vendor?
[2:34:15] byrdeen45: i gave up on gear
[2:34:20] Vivelli: wildstar death inc, when casuals have no path forward on gearing
[2:34:23] Sandisy: keep in mind that casuals are the majority of players. you're pretty much in a bubble in your mythic guild
[2:34:28] jure__: consolidate the pvp gearing into pve as well and balance it
[2:34:28] RobSaidOtis: @Towelliee is legion generally considered a good expansion?
[2:34:34] Bugszy: valour just like in wrath
[2:34:35] maardal: Anima Vendor ^^
[2:34:36] RunningOutOfRAM: 210 KEKW
[2:34:43] Bounty4321: @Towelliee PvP is the best way to gear atm, in terms of feeling good. I get ilvl 220's and go do raid / m+ and have got nothing on full clears since raid launch lol
[2:34:46] TrowGundam: You NEED that backup in place. Becuase RNG will fucking cuck some people, typically me, that backup needs to be there
[2:34:51] Sollice: Morning everyone!
[2:34:55] Naturalbeef: Ulduar TW came out at a perfect time
[2:34:56] Thoreya: so back to bfa?
[2:34:57] Orthobullet: Maybe an m+ vendor that you grind currency for in m+
[2:34:57] Belirs: why ? :)
[2:34:57] thebakeriscomingforu: Would love a badge vendor. It just worked and there wasn't a reason to remove it
[2:35:00] Thoreya: we gone full circle
[2:35:02] ExigentMidnight: Overgearing content is a big deal for a lot of casual raiding guilds. Telling them to just run LFR doesn't work for them
[2:35:07] slatester: imagine if borderlands didn't drop loot
[2:35:08] WoW_StandalonE: but you can buy gear from AH, 4-5 pieces
[2:35:10] tezrelli: what's the highest ilvl you can upgrade covenant gear with anima?
[2:35:12] Firelordxsrx: Whats a good Ilvl for Heroic raid?
[2:35:13] akia03: another tw the 20th this month
[2:35:19] Wulfenst: @Towelliee Thats my raid team in a nutshell, we are stuck at council normal and only a handful of us are 190+
[2:35:19] Kinghorn: I went 0/18 for heroic raid drops, finally got a shit trinket on #19
[2:35:21] PhillyDilly18: Sometimes it feels like Blizzard thinks all people do is play WoW all day to put in all this time.
[2:35:24] Cypfer: My guild is a casual HC guild with a curve goal, i'm too old for raiding
[2:35:28] Veras_7: my hunter cant get a weaponf rom the great vault, been stuck on ilvl 190 since i bought the boe week 2, ruining the game for me
[2:35:41] Uglyfoot: If they wanted to nerf normal loot so much they should have just let us have 2 pieces of loot from the great vault.
[2:35:48] Cypfer: @Skirmisher07 still siting on a 180 sorrowbane LUL
[2:35:49] AgentWhiskeyy: And what‚Äôs funnier is you do all of that dungeoning, raiding, and pvping just for 1 pick I the vault
[2:35:54] Visinatrix: What professions are you running on your main?
[2:35:59] AgentWhiskeyy: How tf you get 1 item?! Out of all that
[2:36:05] brazkat: last week i went from 190 to 208 just slamming my face into keys
[2:36:07] tdpark_: how did you get the name Towelliee?
[2:36:07] Belirs: D:
[2:36:10] RunningOutOfRAM: FeelsDegenerateMan
[2:36:10] Bounty4321: I don't understand why Ulduar drops 3x as much loot as normal Castle Nath, it's so much easier.
[2:36:13] ChrisarN: 144 layers for the mount, we in there for a while. @towelliee
[2:36:15] MrKray2: I am in a casual raiding guild I have highest ilvl of 205 none of them are high enough to even push keys
[2:36:22] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Skirmisher07 I got a 216 Bow from Spires during the first GV week :)
[2:36:23] pereadin: I would fall under that characteristic
[2:36:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: I had to push myself this week to do the content tastelessRage
[2:36:27] Kinghorn: they will nerf it for next time @Bounty4321
[2:36:28] zigzugg: its ok wing 2 of lfr comes out Kappa
[2:36:43] pereadin: Switched to playin casually. Play anywhere from 8 to 16 hours a day. Struggle to get loot.
[2:36:46] RunningOutOfRAM: What do you need for +14
[2:36:47] nielefs: 210 reward for a M15 is to low IMO
[2:36:48] weirdsp4ce: buy them coins to buy that loot
[2:36:50] StateFarm206: i timed a 10 and im only 200
[2:36:57] Cypfer: 210 from +15 is ass
[2:37:00] itsagentscully: imagine how people who are timing 15s feel..
[2:37:02] d1stract10n: lfr gives M0 dung loot so it wont help
[2:37:02] TheRiwen: i cant get me to gear up my alts
[2:37:03] Saakki: did +11 mists with 203, 1.3 sec left
[2:37:03] Bounty4321: @Kinghorn Don't you think they should just buff raid loot? The odds are terrible, M+ has better odds with 2/5.
[2:37:11] albiejw: 205 is more than enough for a +10, we do 12s/13s with average ilvl of 204
[2:37:12] niekp89: i got 1800 and are gearing this way
[2:37:14] zsoltix30: Hey Towelee! It is good to see you today. What is your opinion about this expansion so far? :)
[2:37:16] AgentWhiskeyy: I do about 20+ mythic + keystones only to barely get anything drop that I actually need
[2:37:16] ChiefLongsword: ChiefLongsword subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! towGold
[2:37:17] Cantelope123: The fact that 7/8/9 all drops the same 200 ilvl is pointless surely
[2:37:18] pereadin: M+ needs ilevel boost and amount boost
[2:37:20] fkncrlos: as a casual. I was putting in the hours because holidays days off. now being back to work rip
[2:37:26] Bounty4321: @Towelliee I miss 3 chesting in Legion, don't you?
[2:37:26] jure__: yea, because its pugable, small group and very scalable
[2:37:28] vyjinx: i timed 10 with 197 as healer. you just cant really pug in necrotic week
[2:37:29] MrKray2: The closest to me is 192
[2:37:36] pereadin: Nothing too crazy but the ilevel should scale past +15's
[2:37:36] cevyr1: Maybe, if they are one of the hundreds of DPS that apply to most groups
[2:37:40] bmi86: also most casual that are time constrained have 30-45 min once in a while to do a key
[2:37:45] RunningOutOfRAM: It is fine :D
[2:37:46] Wildside1177: I did a host of M+ this week and got nothing. 2 weeks in a row.
[2:37:47] Bashar_Strygar: @Towelliee why not use the pvp system for M+ or raids? Have dungeons points that you collect that you can spend at a vendor?
[2:37:48] luckfore: Just revert back to the old gearing system. Was way more fun
[2:37:53] Vowels_tv: @Towelliee you aren't doing the word casual right. Casual does not = not skilled. Casual ppl still get gear at end of week for doing skilled shit. just do what you can you'll get the gear. Stop giving unskilled players mythic loot.
[2:37:54] greedysob: i did a +3 with ilvl 188+ failed i was top dps as a tank at ilvl 189. just did a +2 with a group of 199 and couldnt get past the first set of trash
[2:37:56] Kromede: kill him with fire chat Kappa
[2:37:57] RunningOutOfRAM: IT IS FINE :FIRE:
[2:38:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: 3 pieces was fine
[2:38:02] byrdeen45: Ya it feels bad running 5 or 6 runs and get nothing
[2:38:05] doogs44: I would be fine with the loot being lower IVL on M+ but there needs to be more aquiried if its going to be a lower tier of gear. I think bringing back badges of justice and ilvl upgrades would fix it
[2:38:05] GoGetItKo: How is M+ 7-10 all ilvl 200 "reward?" Not fine
[2:38:09] ztraws__: i miss bonus rolls, ive gotten some bad luck
[2:38:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: either that or give legion amount loot xd
[2:38:16] GlakusWoW: how long till NA reset?
[2:38:18] rohdey: But Towelliee, the Great Vault IS Titan/War forging
[2:38:22] Tassen95: Mythic+ gives so underwhelming ilvl loot. Really gives no incentive to push M+ other than getting the weekly chest.
[2:38:23] Lazugo: the problem of BFA never was the loot. It was the extra system of the loot (WF, TF and corruption)
[2:38:29] zsoltix30: Hey Towelee! It is good to see you today. What is your opinion about this expansion so far? :)
[2:38:29] d1stract10n: @GlakusWoW 2hrs
[2:38:29] Megadisaster24: The fact that there is no Crafted Gear that is good aside from the Legendary Base gear
[2:38:32] Nostredomas: I mean wing 2 is still 187 ilvl... the way the covenant quests are going the gear you are rewarded will be the same ilvl or higher today... Will almost be no point in doing the new lfr.
[2:38:32] pereadin: @Towelliee what do you think about scaling M+ loot. Like each key level above a 15 adds +1-3 ilevel (determined on their end) to a cap of 233?
[2:38:32] Cypfer: I want my bonus roll coins back SadFace
[2:38:33] lutharr: gettting a characters fully geared doesnt mean people will stop playing. You see its fun to gear up and so choose to so so on more characters.
[2:38:34] GlakusWoW: thx
[2:38:34] Shrenko: some people do like grinding
[2:38:35] Veegore: let us pick an item from each row of the vault
[2:38:35] Vowels_tv: ive never loved this game more than right now
[2:38:35] Jeffmadude: @Towelliee do you miss 3 chesting in legion
[2:38:43] Toasti0: Middle ground BOES!
[2:38:44] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[2:38:46] albiejw: They've gone too far the other way, the end of bfa the gearing was fine and there was no TF/WF. Corruption was the issue there
[2:38:47] TMMOOF: Cool with me, pvp is the best part lol
[2:38:48] TrowGundam: Ya, fuck PvP. I hate it
[2:38:49] niekp89: 1800 is ez
[2:38:50] Vowels_tv: and based off the amount of M+ groups/pvp groups/ raid groups...id say game is in a great spot
[2:38:51] Rypick: Nothing like 20 heroic kills so far and no loot love it
[2:38:51] Bugszy: fuck pvp
[2:38:52] nixxy_7: and if you dont like pvp and are a PVE player your screwed
[2:38:52] D3m0nHunt3r666: pvp tastelessLUL
[2:38:55] Shrenko: I feel like pvp has been in the shadow for many expansions now
[2:38:58] moejimbo: the 8-10 hours a week i get to play... is mostly catching up on weekly shit and a M+ or 3
[2:38:59] AgentWhiskeyy: The loot drop is lame af
[2:39:00] Tassen95: I think it's just like you say, blizz wants us to do all the content every week to have a chance of gearing up through the weekly rewards. It's gonna keep players in the game until they get burnt out since the game is turning into a chore
[2:39:00] thebakeriscomingforu: How to keep players in the game: Have it be fun. People will make alts if they've done everything on their main
[2:39:01] AutumnReds: let us pick up every slot from the vault :)
[2:39:01] Vivelli: or just buy BOE's
[2:39:04] slatester: imagine the world first race if they didn't have access to all of those BoE's this tier
[2:39:04] AgentWhiskeyy: The % is horrific
[2:39:06] zigzugg: imo bfa loot drops let people play alts more everything else sucked though
[2:39:08] Bounty4321: What about two items from vault?
[2:39:09] RunningOutOfRAM: The problem is not 1.8 the problem is 2.1 LUL
[2:39:10] stormbear7: @Towelliee if you have 9 vault options pick 2 is reasonable for the amount of work getting all 9 options is
[2:39:10] I_DoctorSatan_I: please dont talk in chat unless you are 2400 rated! Thanks! :)
[2:39:10] nei_fax: Middleground is being Sodapoppin and buying 225 rings off AH with donations
[2:39:12] ChrisarN: M+ is in a bad state currently @towelliee
[2:39:12] rohdey: just give us the ability to wear 2 lego's and all should be grand
[2:39:12] nixxy_7: But i hate PVP... i am a PVE player... i dont like to pvp... just to dungeo nand bosses kill
[2:39:13] hobano890: if you fill out all the pve options in great vault then get 2 picks
[2:39:14] realnzall: If my choices are between having to PvP and not getting gear, I'd rather not play the game at all and catch up on my backlog
[2:39:14] Belirs: CouldYouNot wait you guys are getting loot ?
[2:39:14] doogs44: Badges of justice as a consolation for no loot and let us upgrade ilvl to heroic or mythic raid level.
[2:39:19] Cypfer: @Rypick 15 and 0 for me LUL
[2:39:20] raldrik: RNG does a better job at keeping people in. Knowing that you can run a dungeon you already have done but could get a better version of it keeps people playing and including players who are still progressing
[2:39:26] metavahn231: i wont accept this massive gold/time sink of a xpac ill just quit untill they fix it tbh
[2:39:28] pereadin: @zigzugg I agree
[2:39:31] itzmebk: isnt twisting corridors opens next week ?
[2:39:41] I_DoctorSatan_I: @originaletBK this week
[2:39:41] pereadin: I can't even play my alts cause of how long it takes to get loott
[2:39:42] thebakeriscomingforu: Wotlk, there wasn't a concern about loot, and there were badge vendors
[2:39:49] Antdavs24: ulduar was a half decent catch up but generally the current method they have its impossible to get loot
[2:39:54] Belirs: i ran 30 +10-14 the other sides so far LUL no cube
[2:39:59] pereadin: KEKW
[2:39:59] Epicsapphire1988: i dont get shit
[2:40:00] GlakusWoW: the will be so good if badge vendors came back
[2:40:06] bcole079: How beneficial would it be for them to allow people to get 2 items out of the weekly chest?
[2:40:06] PaydayPaylor: when are US servers up?
[2:40:07] ChrisarN: is twisting corridors out yet?
[2:40:13] Undying_faith: dang
[2:40:13] AgentWhiskeyy: @belirs I felt that pain just for a weapon
[2:40:14] Bounty4321: How about if you complete around 7 or all 9 activities to fill the vault, you can pick 2 items?
[2:40:15] albiejw: Whats worse is the horrendous new affixes they've added (spiteful towWipe ), so when you don't get loot you think whats the point
[2:40:17] cevyr1: I try and run my one keystone a week, becasue I cannot be bothered to apply to 50+ groups to get rejected by all of them
[2:40:20] RunningOutOfRAM: EXSPOSED LUL
[2:40:25] jure__: yea thats absolutely not happening LUL
[2:40:26] ZetherTV: buy loot meta 4 sure
[2:40:27] niekp89: ez 4 pieces
[2:40:30] luckfore: blizzard 200 iq
[2:40:34] Getitonthelow: but you're a millionaire in RL
[2:40:35] d1stract10n: i ran over ten +12-15 keys and got 1 item thats a upgrade form my off spec
[2:40:36] pereadin: There are 0 guilds doing mythic on my realm my DK is on so I can't even do tthat xD
[2:40:38] TMMOOF: thats broken and elitist
[2:40:50] CazualD: Just start a currency system like pvp (Mythic token) and vendor mythic gear just like pvp.. you can pick gear with stats you need vs stats that are shit for your spec
[2:40:51] TMMOOF: Not everyone can be expected to drops hundreds of thousands of gold
[2:40:51] Megadisaster24: hmm, almost as if blizzard thought of that and it's why tokens are so cheap
[2:40:52] nixxy_7: @Towelliee i am already seeing in 1 month... Lootboxes with gear in store from Activision for extra LOOT RNG
[2:40:55] jure__: BOEs really shouldnt go past M+2 ilvl
[2:40:59] I_DoctorSatan_I: Ill have my 235 Soulforge Embers crafted today :)
[2:41:03] WoW_StandalonE: a road to p2w
[2:41:04] weirdsp4ce: exactly thats what they want
[2:41:07] AgentWhiskeyy: People legit just care about ilevel lol
[2:41:08] metavahn231: you should get 2 vault rewards
[2:41:08] Tassen95: @cevyr1 Pushing my M+ rating I applied to probably over 200 groups per 1 I got into. And that's someone who has done +20 push on every dungeon every expac prior. The system really is fucked
[2:41:14] zsoltix30: Hey Towelee! It is good to see you today. What is your opinion about this expansion so far? :)
[2:41:17] frostoshiro: yeah raiding loot is so bad
[2:41:23] AgentWhiskeyy: So if you buy shyt items you get an invite
[2:41:25] pereadin: I had to do 19 Theater of Pains back to back to back (about 16 hours of one dungeon) just to get tthe 2 pieces of loot I needed
[2:41:26] Belirs: maybe make some of your efforts to your greater vault carry over to the next week ? :) so if you did 10 dungeons last week you get the first 4 free next week
[2:41:33] Cypfer: I killed 15 heroic bosses without loot. amazing
[2:41:34] metavahn231: this xpac is actually p2w LUL
[2:41:35] TheDread: @Towelliee That logic is BiS for blizzard LUL
[2:41:36] pereadin: Now compound that for the other pieces of loot, its ridiculous
[2:41:38] nixxy_7: WoW is turning P2W instead of F2P skill grind
[2:41:43] Ezzenlive: you play the game for a living. and don't got time for that. Imagine people who work outside of wow
[2:41:43] odriscoll1234: Hahhaha
[2:41:47] afcsilvestre: Pvp is atm best way to get gear, but atm pvp is really hard for new players, unless you are othe of those specs that are broken with stupid burst.
[2:41:55] pereadin: You did, I ttraded it tto you
[2:41:57] Towelliee: !armory

[2:41:59] pereadin: Sanguine Depths
[2:42:02] nixxy_7: because if your forced to buy tokens>sell tokens just to gera upand keep up with gear sounds P2W to mee
[2:42:03] 2MakeMe: Ya tbh raiding is almost not worth it at all and m+ doesnt help either
[2:42:03] weirdsp4ce: ring
[2:42:03] RunningOutOfRAM: YEAH @Towelliee you make a lot of sense if you have 99% and 1% people in terms of gear that mean - you can buy your self to the 1% with Real Money Blizzard is amazing at thinking that system :O
[2:42:04] d1stract10n: @Towelliee my one upgrade was TW ulduar helm
[2:42:13] metavahn231: yea screw pvp, ill just quit instead LUL
[2:42:40] rsimpson105: Mornin fellas and ladies
[2:42:40] tdpark_: I dont have enough gold to buy leggo upgrade PepeWhy
[2:42:41] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:42:46] Chrysophylax_I: I find it extremely disappointing they couldn‚Äôt have got some significant changes to the game for this reset
[2:42:49] slatester: @Towelliee I can't even get my conduit to drop from the world boss
[2:42:55] laforgez00: IT SUCKS that you need to PVP to get upgrades
[2:42:57] Tassen95: You got no upgrades from your dungeons being a ~10? hour per day player. Imagine having a life outside of wow OMEGALUL @Towelliee
[2:43:03] odriscoll1234: I spent over 1500 pounds in 10 months on tokens
[2:43:09] nixxy_7: @tdpark_ everyone has gold if you buy tokens... you just buy 3-4 tokens and you and you gear full head to toe just selling them at Ah its called P2W
[2:43:13] josh8555: yea I just dropped 84k on a upgrade but it might get nerfed lol
[2:43:24] Skullbash0r: If a timewalking raid gives you more loot than a standard normal tier raid of the current content something is very wrong with your game
[2:43:25] Belirs: BabyRage i hate titanforging BabyRage i want tianforging back BabyRage
[2:43:28] pereadin: What do you think about each key level above a 15 adding 3 ilevel @Towelliee ?
[2:43:28] Bounty4321: @Towelliee Do you think Legion 3 chesting was the better system for M+?
[2:43:33] PadidinJones: To the VINDICAR!
[2:43:34] pereadin: Incentivizes pushing imo
[2:43:35] RunningOutOfRAM: Pog PVP GOD
[2:43:39] huntero: pvp OMEGALUL
[2:43:40] AgentWhiskeyy: Seriously
[2:43:41] PadidinJones: Hi @Towelliee hows it going?
[2:43:41] Sandisy: that's very very bad. the disconnect between effort and reward is bad
[2:43:43] AgentWhiskeyy: All that work
[2:43:46] AgentWhiskeyy: For tuesday
[2:43:49] TheRiwen: fun times
[2:43:51] GlakusWoW: pvp vendor if you reach 2100 is giga good actually
[2:43:52] Shrenko: pvp is back!!
[2:43:52] slatester: @Belirs titanforging loot that never drops doesn't solve the problem
[2:43:53] D3m0nHunt3r666: It's from the AH @Towelliee Kappa
[2:43:53] AgentWhiskeyy: Legit just wait till vault
[2:43:54] Bugszy: and on tuesday you will get a piece that matches your best item on already so becomes a waist lol
[2:43:57] tdpark_: @Nixieed I wish I can buy, but I cant, because region locked
[2:44:02] zigzugg: they should make best gear come from pet battles Kappa
[2:44:05] TrowGundam: I say drasticaly up the Anima reward from M+ and then add a vendor where you can buy gear for Anima, that would help. Could do multiple iLvl tears for increasing prices. Would help quite a bit with the gearing situation
[2:44:08] byrdeen45: well ill have 235 shoulders today after doing the tower
[2:44:10] Aervyper: @Towelliee so what is twisting corridors
[2:44:13] AgentWhiskeyy: let‚Äôs give it up for the real MVP the Vault
[2:44:14] metavahn231: why u only got a 210 lego
[2:44:16] jure__: or worst
[2:44:20] niekp89: wensday for me
[2:44:21] yeti82: well now gear matters again :)
[2:44:26] yeti82: :P
[2:44:26] swordart_19: I gear just from pvp 4Head
[2:44:27] Thoreya: im getting possibly 3 upgrades today from conquest vault and maybee world bosss
[2:44:27] nixxy_7: @tdpark_ then farm 99999 hours profession and hope you raise that much to buy at least 1-2 pieces :) if you dont P2W tokens sell for gearing ah
[2:44:28] Thoreya: lets hope
[2:44:34] swordart_19: it is great !
[2:44:35] Bugszy: heroic raider and dont get loot lol
[2:44:35] Tassen95: @Veramer Probably focusing more than 1 spec
[2:44:35] Belirs: what if loot you allready got has a chance to warforge/titanforge :) the next time it drops
[2:44:38] Chrysophylax_I: I don‚Äôt mind not getting as much loot, but the system is not balanced. Easy to get pvp gear and no-lifers can run M+ all day to get loot.
[2:44:38] odriscoll1234: Lol
[2:44:44] Epicsapphire1988: mine was trash last week i got 4 CLOAKS! and a neck that I already had -.-
[2:44:47] othraerir: spreadsheets running the game
[2:44:47] Nihclouse: do I need to switch covenants before reset if I wanna be able to play it?
[2:44:50] tlsmith3638: but this is what the ppl wanted for loot to matter
[2:44:51] albiejw: Have Blizz even said anything about the loot issue?
[2:44:56] pereadin: I hope they do something this week about it especially now that the RWF is over.
[2:44:57] yeti82: hahaha :D
[2:44:58] Thoreya: people dont want bfa man
[2:44:59] laforgez00: this loot system sucks. pvp is needed for PVE players...
[2:45:01] Thoreya: its different

[2:45:14] TrowGundam: @presidentfun They've been on vacation till this yesterday, so no not yet
[2:45:15] yeti82: true :D
[2:45:16] weirdsp4ce: the loot thing i feel will get better as it progresses. but I like the game overall
[2:45:16] zigzugg: I kinda wish they let professions craft epic boe gear like in past expacs
[2:45:17] t0pgun_: LUL
[2:45:17] Belirs: POGGERS +3 ilvl on my ring POGGERS thats +5 dps POGGERS
[2:45:18] odriscoll1234: I did full clear nm and hc raid and got nothing lol
[2:45:18] Veegore: FeelsGood
[2:45:19] I_DoctorSatan_I: said no one ever
[2:45:20] Bugszy: @Towelliee love the voice hahahaha
[2:45:20] yeti82: good old days :P
[2:45:22] KonradGM: thing with pvp and great vault you can get max 2 items per week since once youre conquest capped you no longer can get any gear
[2:45:22] Antherage: Now I can grind stygia to socket it in 4 weeks, it'll be a real nice ring!
[2:45:25] albiejw: @TrowGundam thanks bud
[2:45:29] d1stract10n: ok boomer
[2:45:33] Sincline387: There are two extremes, I fear them over reacting and moving to far into gear waterfall mode.
[2:45:33] GoGetItKo: towelliee fuckin' hilarious KEKW
[2:45:34] thebakeriscomingforu: every boss should drop loot, may not be for you, or a big upgrade but loot should drop
[2:45:35] piratechris: The old days weren't that good though
[2:45:35] pereadin: @Towelliee The only reason we do M+ now is for raider.io score which isn't even a blizzard implemented system xD
[2:45:36] odriscoll1234: Llllllllol
[2:45:42] KonradGM: with m+, as slim as loot chance is you still can get rng jesused for upgrades
[2:45:42] Drelnar: one upgrade POGGERS
[2:45:46] moejimbo: LFR 2 gunna drop a piece of loot for everyone!
[2:45:53] Bazsidiver: in calssic zg resets every 3 days and it drops some item that are better than mc and bwl ones
[2:45:54] Thoreya: mmo is a toxic cesspool
[2:45:56] Chrysophylax_I: Raid feels pointless right now
[2:45:57] Aervyper: @Towelliee PVP is easier to gear now than PVE
[2:45:57] ztraws__: hot takes

[2:46:19] Tassen95: KEKW
[2:46:20] Thoreya: bfa was fucking trash
[2:46:20] Belirs: CLEARING WHOLE MAP KEKW FOR WEEKS KEKW TO UPGRADE NECK KEKW NO TY
[2:46:21] laforgez00: They need to get rid of the loot system that is it. SL is great
[2:46:24] Odinslayer: KEKW
[2:46:24] Veegore: What i would've give to go gather azerite
[2:46:24] Thoreya: i never wanna go back to that shit
[2:46:27] abbosss: compared to SL the loot system was top notch
[2:46:28] Bugszy: he has a point lol
[2:46:30] josh8555: ok so no fiery brand nerf lol
[2:46:32] Mitteennss: BFA wasnt that bad TBH Kappa
[2:46:34] cinnamints: It's about the time we were expecting BFA appreciation to start!
[2:46:36] Boomhauwer: At the end of the day the loot is the only thing that could be wrong imo. Everything else is amazing
[2:46:41] Belirs: BFA classic when Kappa
[2:46:42] madmat93: Draneor was Cool Kappa
[2:46:48] Shrenko: nope BFA still ass
[2:46:50] Tassen95: Bring Legion back
[2:46:50] PokerFaceMoose: rose colored glasses
[2:46:51] pereadin: The coolest shit about BFA was corruption and the amount of loot we got xD
[2:46:52] OMGLuscius: bfa was trash
[2:46:53] Amarlian: it takes a bit to even gear up for heroic dungeons or LFR to be honest. If you are a casual @Towelliee
[2:46:56] Odinslayer: i would love to have another WoD than another BFA
[2:46:56] Tealkan: The Draenor Apologists ouch
[2:47:03] Orthobullet: Thats the human condition
[2:47:07] Belirs: i swear if i have to farm any more pearls in naz like zones im gonna unsub :)
[2:47:07] slatester: 144 floors of torghast just for a mount sums up this expansion nicely
[2:47:08] Cypfer: Draenor dungeons OOF
[2:47:11] sharie: WoD was the worst in terms of the amount of content
[2:47:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: It just players are not feeling "rewarded" for the content they are doing, weather its 20+ Mythic+ duns, x2 H CN clears with 1-2 pieces of loot. It does not feel rewarding at this point despite how early of a expansion this is.
[2:47:15] chrslp: Whos looking forward to BC? FeelsGoodMan
[2:47:21] ch0ller: I love WOD now, for leveling alts
[2:47:24] d1stract10n: get WoD the fuck out of here
[2:47:25] laforgez00: LEGION it was
[2:47:26] KonradGM: i would love to get WoD with Legion systems
[2:47:28] Barkerisonfire: BFA is still awful, I just want the lion head shoulders from warfronts but fuck thaaat
[2:47:28] byrdeen45: Well shadowlands isnt anything to write home about
[2:47:32] nixxy_7: DRAENOR was BAD
[2:47:32] TMMOOF: I remember sitting at blizzcon and seeing the launch trailer for MOP... I swore it was april fools lol
[2:47:35] Bounty4321: People who say that have no idea what they're talking about. Classic loot mattered not because of scarcity, it mattered because items from dungeons and ALL raid tiers were always relevant.
[2:47:36] Bugszy: wrath was best
[2:47:37] Odinslayer: @slatester you literally doesnt need to do it in one sitting, it supposed to be during the whole patch or expansion, stop this shit
[2:47:37] falldrgn: Lichlords of Northrend calling it now
[2:47:38] foxies_havocing: Legion was the best by far
[2:47:38] nixxy_7: DRAENOR was 1 MONTH CONTENT
[2:47:40] laforgez00: LEGION was great!
[2:47:41] odriscoll1234: LUL
[2:47:42] TheRiwen: I did love dreanor
[2:47:42] zigzugg: WoD brewmaster was OP though
[2:47:42] Cypfer: Cataclysm was the best expansion
[2:47:42] Veegore: I just want glad stance and saberon back from WoD
[2:47:43] NVbrutal: legion is still prolly my favorite expac
[2:47:44] OMGLuscius: draenor was terrible, and bfa comes right after
[2:47:44] Thoreya: draenor was so bad they stopped giving us sub numbers lmao
[2:47:45] cryptbane: Wrath is still my favorite sorry
[2:47:45] Thoreya: yikes
[2:47:47] Wulfgrym: never ever ever again WOD
[2:47:48] Jsibs: I liked the way classes were in WOD rest of the xpac was shit
[2:47:50] nixxy_7: DRAENOR was LITERALLY = 1 MONTH CONTENT... you had nothing to do but WEEKLY!! on DRAENOR for 12 MONTHS
[2:47:53] bg_feb: i quit draenor because i couldnt stand my garrison
[2:47:54] tlolod: Legion was the best
[2:47:57] luckfore: BFA was almost as bad
[2:47:57] TMMOOF: I liked Draenor
[2:47:58] ch0ller: 1 to 50 in 12 hours in WOD SeemsGood
[2:47:59] abbosss: THANK YOU
[2:47:59] Kromede: WoD was the only time i took a 6 month break
[2:48:01] nixxy_7: was the WORSE time for DRAENOR
[2:48:02] bennythejet_ne: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve answered this a lot but why no kyrian on pallys‚Äîthanks brother like the content
[2:48:04] laforgez00: Legion was the best
[2:48:06] Tanstrike: Draenor was what made me leave
[2:48:07] Damon_Riddle: WoD would have been good if they didnt drop the content ball, the systems were soild.
[2:48:07] thebakeriscomingforu: Started in TBC, Wolk and Legion I consider the best
[2:48:09] fewyn: what would we be playing if wow was dead
[2:48:09] slatester: @Odinslayer how does that change anything, you're putting in the same amount of hours for a terrible reward
[2:48:11] verm1111: legion was dope
[2:48:12] nixxy_7: You literally had 1 month content story and thats IT just weekly raids and AFK
[2:48:12] metavahn231: how was that shipyard
[2:48:12] abbosss: people that don't play the game need to fuck off
[2:48:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: I played WoD for 2 weeks on my Warrior. I came back to Legion. That's how bad it was kids.
[2:48:13] conv3rge_: We'd all be weebin' out on FFXIV
[2:48:14] GlakusWoW: WoD was literally the only expansion wich made me take a break
[2:48:18] duolmaercs: Cata broke it for me personally, but I agree with you @Towelliee on WoD
[2:48:19] ambiotic: go back and look at class balancing in WOD, it was the most unbalanced the game has ever been
[2:48:20] N3llee: Just joined.. whats the topic
[2:48:21] NeoJon82: @Towelliee So it takes a Bad Expansion to then have a Good Expansion.
[2:48:21] billybaroo1: wow has to many other things to do to die
[2:48:22] chrslp: I quit playing in BFA and didnt play till this xpac
[2:48:23] d1stract10n: @Towelliee we need to time travel to not go back to WoD next Expac
[2:48:26] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: yea, i wonder which button is gonna saved SL
[2:48:33] Belirs: OMEGALUL
[2:48:33] odriscoll1234: BibleThump
[2:48:33] CazualD: WoD killed the guild i was in, everyone quit playing
[2:48:34] jerexify: @Towelliee What people fail to realize is that content they don't like =/= no content.
[2:48:35] Tealkan: Blackrock Foundry was the only good thing out of Draenor. Otherwise you just sat alone in your Garrison waiting for the mission tables to complete.
[2:48:39] Qargory: English_Bacon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! as a bfa player, i didnt think it was that bad lol, but i do prefer SL now that its here
[2:48:39] ArcaneMaki: Let Alone Warlords had the shittiest storyline and shit wizard khadgar
[2:48:41] Odinslayer: @slatester tbh a mount for the maw is not terrible at all
[2:48:43] dannyis1337: I played every expac but quit during BFA
[2:48:44] PadidinJones: Listen to @Towelliee he knows
[2:48:45] Tassen95: I caught up to full HC and +15 loot in 2 weeks of returning to BFA. Wasn't too bad ngl
[2:48:46] NVbrutal: wod had 0 content lol
[2:48:47] funKShun: Draenor had gold Kappa
[2:48:47] GoGetItKo: can you give a few examples why?
[2:48:52] MrTahmm: Challange accepted
[2:48:55] Aerodynamic_Fetus: wod had some good raids though
[2:48:55] slatester: @Odinslayer it is for people that have been exalted in the maw for weeks now
[2:48:55] N3llee: the leveling story was
[2:48:56] notpoder: what was so bad about wod @Towelliee
[2:48:57] TheAtomHour: "Challenge accepted" -Blizz
[2:48:59] Belirs: that one guy that farmed his heart of azeroth OMEGALUL untill the last day OMEGALUL just to have the highest neck OMEGALUL i hope hes satisfied LUL
[2:49:00] myguyhood: ive been super lucky and managed to get 206 from mythics, but i havent moved from 204-206 for 2 weeks now#
[2:49:01] Cypfer: true
[2:49:02] Thoreya: yup
[2:49:02] swordart_19: 
[2:49:02] laforgez00: I made big gold in Dreanor but it was really badf
[2:49:04] N3llee: everything else was crap
[2:49:04] deedeemegadoodooo: great transmogs tho
[2:49:05] Getitonthelow: @towelliee are you going to grind all 180 floors today in torghast
[2:49:05] ZaDarkAngel: @Towelliee the best thing on WOD was the musci :D
[2:49:08] nixxy_7: Exactly !! you cant compare to Draenor !! Draenor was WORSE expansion was literally 1 month Content... while BFA had over 24 months out of 12 months content...that is why BFA had more content ... bc People got SCARED seeing how low the community dropped in DRAENOR it almost went BANKRUPT
[2:49:09] N3llee: garrison was a huge failure
[2:49:10] Chrysophylax_I: Do devs have to actually be in the office to work on the game? Why is teleworking delaying things so much?
[2:49:12] KonradGM: Wod had no content, Bfa had 'a lot of concent' it was just that i didnt enojy doing it
[2:49:16] Roughneck124: As a casual player I pretty much stop playing wow during WoD
[2:49:17] Vigi9413: Did WoD almost kill wow or was it the year long HFC?
[2:49:19] jerexify: @swordart_19 Well... bye.
[2:49:24] PadidinJones: I dont hate this expac. I think that after proper bug and system fixes, everything will be gucci
[2:49:27] NeoJon82: I can't believe there are WOD Private Servers....yikes
[2:49:31] moejimbo: i only liked blackrock foundry.... the rest was a dumpster fire
[2:49:32] raldrik: grind is good. I hate how people play an MMO and think grind is bad. If there is no grind there is nothing to do. If you want to progress through a system to find the end and "win" play a single player RPG
[2:49:33] robertjordan83: @Towelliee ie never cancel 2/3 of the xpac
[2:49:36] Belirs: :) "no more time travelling orcs" post it on blizzard hq fridge
[2:49:42] Findlyn: I dont know Towelliee, if you were an altoholic gold horder that just wanted to do FB games WoD was great
[2:49:43] funKShun: The only game that can kill wow is wow itself LUL
[2:49:45] nixxy_7: Nop another Draenor will probably 99% Shutdown WOW forever
[2:49:46] Darthyrevan: that selfie cam patch tho towShappens
[2:49:51] laforgez00: gearing is trash in SL
[2:49:56] chrslp: LUL
[2:49:58] foxies_havocing: WPvP in draenor was good
[2:49:59] tdpark_: farm gold WoD
[2:50:02] metavahn231: Ashran pvp was hype
[2:50:02] nixxy_7: Activision cant afford a mistake that huge
[2:50:04] RagingbullTX: More like sitting in your garrison
[2:50:06] byrdeen45: the raiding in shadowlands is good but everything else is kinda ass
[2:50:07] Amarlian: Dont forget the super interesting Flying unlock that they didnt want
[2:50:09] Tealkan: Oh the best part of WoD was BFA making it even worse by turning Yriel psycho
[2:50:14] Vigi9413: Selfie cam was a terrible decision
[2:50:17] Belirs: less then 2m players
[2:50:20] Belirs: for sure
[2:50:20] TMMOOF: Ashran is still dope af
[2:50:21] CDubTheRIPper: Tanaan jungle NotLikeThis
[2:50:22] KonradGM: Wod/Mop was the time towelliee spend the most doing viewer runs i think
[2:50:25] robertjordan83: 50 precent less probably
[2:50:38] Drelnar: I mean, why not just let us get full bis in like 1-2 months ? fucking idiots complaining about being done can just stfu and play alts @Towelliee
[2:50:39] Belirs: OMEGALUL
[2:50:40] sharie: KEKW
[2:50:44] bmi86: subscription base would have plummeted way more if the gold wasnt coming in garison
[2:50:44] nixxy_7: KEKW
[2:50:44] chrslp: LUL
[2:50:44] myguyhood: gearing keepers everyone occupied?
[2:50:46] Belirs: KEKW bro
[2:50:47] Cypfer: LUL LUL
[2:50:49] TheKitsuneAdventures: whoever says wod was good i know a good doctor in a mental asylum you can visit
[2:50:50] Kromede: and pepe
[2:50:50] Archiee: truth
[2:50:52] sharie: Bruh
[2:50:53] laforgez00: KEKW
[2:50:54] NOYDB: LUL
[2:50:55] nixxy_7: BUT its SOO TRUEEE
[2:50:56] KonradGM: but dat selfie though
[2:50:57] GoGetItKo: KEKW I didn't know that
[2:50:57] aikopooh: kekw
[2:50:58] KisShadi: selfie cam PogChamp
[2:50:58] CDubTheRIPper: Legion waz a big time for viewer raids
[2:50:58] nixxy_7: its actualyl TRUE
[2:51:00] Cypfer: Rest in Pepe
[2:51:00] cryptbane: That garrison shit was horrid
[2:51:02] Wulfgrym: the only content for WOD was the log OFF button
[2:51:04] Vigi9413: oh God I remember the Tanaan jungle grind everyday
[2:51:06] CDubTheRIPper: Was*
[2:51:06] metavahn231: define rich
[2:51:06] zigzugg: WoD gave us the pepe whistle though
[2:51:07] Ventrix_: @TheKitsuneAdventures from personal experience? LUL
[2:51:08] Chrysophylax_I: Got em!
[2:51:11] xKenpachi: i liked the story of draenor tho and the zones
[2:51:11] hazerbaba1337: it was taco Tuesday without tacos bad
[2:51:15] KonradGM: but did bfa had selfie cam stick? CHECK MATE
[2:51:20] KonradGM: Kappa
[2:51:27] brazkat: @Towelliee maybe im not seeing it but i actively pve (keys+raid) and pvp (floating between 15-1800) i guess due to me always doing both im not seeing the gearing problem
[2:51:28] GoGetItKo: @KonradGM it DID actualy
[2:51:28] nixxy_7: lool
[2:51:32] Thoreya: there wasnt no fortnite or warzone back then
[2:51:36] aimassistallen: I wish pvp gave haste mastery gear for my prot pally
[2:51:37] Vigi9413: draenor pvp wasn't terrible though
[2:51:40] Cypfer: Wildstar killd itself not Draenor
[2:51:44] GlakusWoW: wod pvp was good yea
[2:51:45] Auru: wildstar killed itself by far
[2:51:46] TheKitsuneAdventures: @Ventrix_ i surfer from aniexty and they helped it and helping me transitioning since im male to female transgender
[2:51:47] Tealkan: Wildstar is so much wasted potential
[2:51:49] I_DoctorSatan_I: Yea but in SL ppl "want" to feel rewarded with gear, not be RNG or gated behind gear. It just plain sucks right now. If anyone says "GeArInG iS fInE rIgHt nOw, gIt gUd bRuH!" you're delusional and clearly havent been playing WoW all but 5 min.
[2:51:49] egraves7: i went straight to FFXIV for most of WoD
[2:51:51] Shockyjoe: Lets not talk about Wildstar, such a wasted chance.
[2:51:56] metavahn231: draenor really boosted ffxiv
[2:52:05] moejimbo: WAIT! my mount building in my garrison is full of unfed animals now...
[2:52:05] N3llee: Wildstar shit all over the hard core players in alpha and beta and none of them played it because they knew

[2:52:21] N3llee: Ecspecially the Wildstar pvp chick
[2:52:21] PhillyDilly18: How quickly into WoD were you thinking "ooooooh boy"
[2:52:24] N3llee: she was awful
[2:52:28] ArcaneMaki: Wildstar RIP
[2:52:29] Vigi9413: Everyone misses Wildstar but where were all these people when the game was alive?

[2:52:39] luckfore: Assram
[2:52:40] metavahn231: pvp in wod was sick actually
[2:52:43] jure__: trashcan
[2:52:47] Wildtiger21: Did you get gold rating in all your dungeons in Wildsttar to be able to get into raids lol.
[2:52:47] dirtylurker69: Ngl tho, Ashran was fun druing Wod
[2:52:52] Redacted_: gotta farm those sabertooth fangs dawg
[2:52:54] Galadeon: Wildstar was fun, but just too hard to get into endgame.
[2:52:55] deedeemegadoodooo: buggiest battleground*
[2:52:57] grizzlyhorn: i sense cap
[2:52:58] eyeman: eyeman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:53:08] Darthyrevan: wod did do pvp right
[2:53:09] Ventrix_: wildstar wasnt really hardcore thoug? it had a boring ass grindy entry questline that had world boss in it that you might not be able to kill for weeks. besides that it had horrible performance issues
[2:53:10] huntero: Wild St OMEGALUL r
[2:53:11] KonradGM: i was poor fuck that couldn't afford 2 sub games, now i would no life in wildstar lul
[2:53:12] metavahn231: wildstar ran terribly
[2:53:17] datyty: datyty subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[2:53:19] Ordicos: how could you that about ashran with a straight face
[2:53:19] atrophus: Is that exp bar a WA?
[2:53:20] ArcaneMaki: Cmon the gating of Wildstar was crazy AF
[2:53:21] nixxy_7: @Towelliee if you look at Blizz history before and After Activision, you can see that Blizz kinda never released 2 products at the same time, only Activision started doing that after they took over
[2:53:23] Ramstein: Wildstar had the 2nd best Player Housing of any MMO, Star Wars: Galaxies is and will always be #1
[2:53:26] N3llee: @Towelliee truth on wildstar.. spent months in alpha/beta gave 100's of pages of feedback and they changed nothing. Same bugs, same shit systems launched day one that was in alpha beta
[2:53:29] Shockyjoe: The lack of balancing killed it, no need for a tank in Wildstar when you have a high geared dps.
[2:53:33] TrowGundam: @atrophus Yes, it is made by Luxthos
[2:53:33] Boomie82: warhammer online :)
[2:53:34] BrewCityMonk: City of Heroes was my game
[2:53:35] datyty: Didn‚Äôt be mad at me but are servers up?
[2:53:37] flowgo12: what is the best overall convenant for Paladins ?
[2:53:40] Galadeon: Wildstar proved that there is just not a big enogh market anymore for super time consumming "hardcore" vanilla grind mmos
[2:53:41] moejimbo: Lets have some nostalgia for Warhammer Online
[2:53:41] brozzy: i played widstar till everyone said i played wow for 6 years i have mounts.. i HAVE to play only WOW
[2:53:50] ambiotic: Wildstar went all in on 40 man raids and that was that
[2:53:50] jure__: MMOs are hell
[2:53:50] KonradGM: @Towelliee legit only thing that stopped me from playing Wildstar was that i was poor fuck back then and couldn't afford to play it, now iwth job i would no life it there

[2:53:51] Vigi9413: like if SWTOR dies
[2:53:52] Belirs: just play Path of Exile :)
[2:53:54] N3llee: If wildstar had listened to player feedback
[2:53:56] blijex: I miss City of Heroes/Villains, went back and forth to that game so many times
[2:53:58] Deadly26: I actually enjoyed the PvP in Wildstar...
[2:53:59] Ramstein: swt OMEGALUL r
[2:54:02] Anbean: it would be amaznig
[2:54:09] nixxy_7: wildstar community was a bit toxic to wow players
[2:54:12] raldrik: only game I miss is Asherons call. I think thats showed why you cant do a wow 2. Asherons call 2 killed both the original and 2 by splitting the player base.
[2:54:19] huntero: SW OMEGALUL T OMEGALUL R
[2:54:19] Sincline387: SWTOR will eventually die because of loss of license
[2:54:19] Darthyrevan: SWTOR will never die
[2:54:21] Arimous01: city of heroes was amazing imo
[2:54:21] TheDread: No game has been the "wow killer" so far, only blizzard trying to do it first
[2:54:27] Auru: the head dev of that game was a disaster. If they kept on there original path the game would of been great. Man had a hardon for "hardcore" and changed the path of the game last minute and it was a flop.
[2:54:27] zsoltix30: What is your opinion about this expansion so far? :)
[2:54:29] Chrysophylax_I: That‚Äôs how lotro stays alive. They just threaten to shut it down every few years
[2:54:31] PadidinJones: Their most recent story reached epicness!
[2:54:36] PhillyDilly18: Star Trek Online is the same with their Zen store. So much cash coming into that game
[2:54:40] Stoney99: so much RP walk in the leveling story
[2:54:54] Ramstein: Mandalorian MMO when POGGERS
[2:54:56] N3llee: as long as Poppa Disney gets their cut they wont ever pull that licenese
[2:55:00] tlsmith3638: wildstar is my mmo regret i never tried it i tired all other mmos that came out but that one :(
[2:55:02] gshocker77: gshocker77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:55:02] TheKitsuneAdventures: disney has threaten ea with taken away there license already
[2:55:03] moejimbo: you gotta kiss the SIRE!
[2:55:06] chrslp: Who remembers the original Age of Conan that was super hyped up but ended up having really high computer requirements
[2:55:08] weirdsp4ce: anyone excited for are 4?
[2:55:13] weirdsp4ce: aoe
[2:55:15] nixxy_7: They cant close SWTOR , SWTOR was the largest bankrupt investment in the gaming industry they cant afford to shut it down no matter what... they didnt even get 5% of the money they invested, bc all voice acting in Swtor is from the official Lucas Arts holywood actors and its more MONEY
[2:55:17] Sincline387: EA and through them Bioware has the license till 2023......many more f ups like battlegrounds and they won't renew
[2:55:18] Todmeister9000: maybe that Riot MMO will be the WoW killer HahaBall
[2:55:22] Aervyper: @Towelliee was Torghast ever FUN? beside being new in alpha and beta?
[2:55:23] KingofMeccano: it wont die after this year with the 10 year annivesary especially with the login reward system which shows its gone be here forever
[2:55:29] modulo216: I WANNA TALK TO SAMSON
[2:55:32] Vigi9413: What MMO do you regret not trying @towelliee ?
[2:55:37] soldi_26: arena are toxic AF right now....was 1700 went all the way down to 1350 and was still getting paired with 1700. Stun central its crazy how f ed up arena is right now
[2:55:37] nixter93: My dad whos well in his 50's almost 60. is the biggest star wars fan i know. and he spends a SHIT TON of money on star wars shit
[2:55:40] NVbrutal: games like swtor will always be around just cause of the already existing fanbase of the movies.
[2:55:44] hellsinge: no spoilers dude!
[2:55:52] Arimous01: @chrslp i found the box for that in my garage the other day. so unoptimized and flopped hard
[2:55:52] declaring_intent: thats me!

[2:55:55] hobano890: what happened to rift mmo?
[2:55:56] Blakimas: So like WoW
[2:55:59] Cypfer: @Towelliee Anthem was the future Kappa
[2:56:01] ambiotic: the overhaul was pretty good in star wars tbh
[2:56:02] nixxy_7: Heyy we do that in wow too @Towelliee :(
[2:56:07] datyty: Iv tried playing other MMOs. Wow is the only game I can play really.
[2:56:13] DigitalChill: its Beskar, sheesh *pushes glasses back up*
[2:56:17] nixxy_7: SWTOR is Subscribe to do dungeons
[2:56:17] Chrysophylax_I: Is blade and soul still around?
[2:56:18] DeezBaggins: You dont like to flex in org?
[2:56:28] chrslp: @Arimous01 It flopped sooooo damn hard LUL And now its some crappy FTP game
[2:56:29] readswords: wow = characters sitting in fancy moveable wheelchairs
[2:56:29] bmi86: talking about starwars. i still find it so funny that tsn payed the same amount of money for the nhl rights in canada. as disney paid for lucas films
[2:56:33] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee what do you think about RIOT MMO
[2:56:34] fewyn: the story was great... the combat was.... ugh
[2:56:35] readswords: but i love it
[2:56:35] nixxy_7: @Towelliee in SWTOR you cant do raids unless you pay the monthly sub to get gear from Raids or you get no gears
[2:56:36] the_real_doncheadle: @towelliee When you hover over someone, how did you get the information to appear above your chat? Mines always in the way I'm the right side.
[2:56:37] Vigi9413: I tried getting into FF14 but my only thought was "This isn't wow"
[2:56:39] kharnij83: WAY to many buttons to use
[2:56:39] duffluv22: Good morning...anything good from your Vault?
[2:56:41] wrathos_23_soundpower: Micro transactions ruined SWTOR
[2:56:43] Kriven: the endgame and engine killed that game
[2:56:45] Short_TFT: swtor had a great launch, loved playing it. They just didnt have enough content to keep us all around
[2:56:52] Eredae23: Swtor endgame was just crap tho
[2:56:52] datyty: @vigi9413 me playing any mmo LUL
[2:56:58] Arimous01: I love eso but the whole gearing is odd and what turns me off. gear thats best from 3 years ago seems flat on progression
[2:57:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: MTX killed SWBF2 also until afte they fixed that. It's still good in 2021.
[2:57:12] TheSteve: Huttball was the single best pvp experience ive ever had
[2:57:14] RenaShirow: @hobano890 was sold to gamigo and pretty much on its last string last I checked.
[2:57:16] brazkat: swtor still holds a good place in my heart
[2:57:17] thebakeriscomingforu: only other mmo i was able to play more long term was Guildwars 2.
[2:57:17] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I feel that they finally reached a complete endgame now.
[2:57:17] kharnij83: paids to much ion voice acting
[2:57:19] PokerFaceMoose: @TheSteve agreed!
[2:57:19] Vigi9413: although Neverwinter was fun to me
[2:57:20] Melonbrew: I miss WildStar
[2:57:30] thebakeriscomingforu: endgame wasn't really a thing though
[2:57:34] nixxy_7: Swtor was PAy to PLAY just for gear, mats and stuff cost extra
[2:57:38] Ventrix_: i remember the first swtor raid being incredibly buggy. we wasted days for bugged bosses
[2:57:39] Nfwgtd: SUP TOWS
[2:57:41] Sincline387: The dangerous thing is it's not licensed by itself but is part of the over arcing license held by EA...so if EA flops again like with battleground they may have an issue
[2:57:45] Mitteennss: Swtor is shit for end game content now thats why i quit like a year ago
[2:57:46] BullDevil: No it didn't, there were no raids initially, people hit 50 and all there was to do was PVP. Raids were a few months late
[2:57:49] cryptbane: I remember those days
[2:57:53] Anbean: so what killed Rift?
[2:57:54] PadidinJones: There is only so many ways we can kill the emperor
[2:57:57] Vigi9413: I never got into BDO though I heard it wasn't worth
[2:58:03] flowgo12: what is your main atm ?
[2:58:11] Odinslayer: when can he open the vault?
[2:58:14] dv_domino: i still like playing swtor, get to force choke :)
[2:58:19] Arimous01: how long until reset??
[2:58:26] TMMOOF: only pvp? Kappa
[2:58:26] Boomie82: they announced a big open world pvp map for the first? patch and it was just bad. thats when i quit the game :(
[2:58:28] chrslp: MapleStory had OG raids before WoW Kappa
[2:58:29] datyty: My first mmo was wow. Prob why I dislike any other similar game.
[2:58:46] Cypfer: 1h33min till reset right?
[2:58:48] vincenzo_peruggiia: The Cartel Shop Killed everything
[2:58:48] Vigi9413: nothing beats wow raids tbh
[2:58:49] Ventrix_: @Boomie82 i loved the 0.5fps Kappa
[2:58:52] Bugszy: 33 mins
[2:58:54] Undying_faith: @Towelliee So does Twisting Corridor's unlock next tuesday?
[2:58:59] Vigi9413: actually nothing beats wow combat
[2:59:03] Shrenko: @Undying_faith today
[2:59:05] Delicer1994: AngelThump
[2:59:13] cursedcr0wn: what i find lacking from any other mmo is the fluidity of gameplay. wow is so fucking good at it
[2:59:16] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @Undying_faith (warning)
[2:59:17] Arimous01: I think eso combat is much better than wow
[2:59:27] zigzugg: has it been confirmed?
[2:59:28] Kromede: Runes of Magic, my first mmo, "f2p" Kappa
[2:59:32] Undying_faith: Woo
[2:59:34] luckfore: whats the prerequisite ?
[2:59:44] Aervyper: @Towelliee what is so good about twisting corridors cause TBH Torghast sucks
[2:59:48] PadidinJones: Get the shalmourne
[2:59:48] thebakeriscomingforu: FF14 I could never get into. I played it for a week after the relaunch and cancelled
[2:59:49] meezgrind: What exactly do we gain from doing Twisted Corridors?
[2:59:51] Vigi9413: you think people will get all floors done today in twisting?
[2:59:53] KingofMeccano: they only had one raid in the expansion you are talking about, the one that was in the current expansion i believe has been a really hard one
[3:00:04] datyty: Is raid finder wing 2 open today?
[3:00:06] KingofMeccano: *is
[3:00:07] chrslp: I like the Venthyr questline. Looking forward to this weeks
[3:00:11] Boomie82: have you played warhammer online back in the days @Towelliee?
[3:00:11] Bacon_21: @cursedcr0wn the most fluid imo was Wildstar combat may it RIP.
[3:00:16] Tyrandian: I'd be really surprised if they didn't. I'm a Blizzard Shill and would be disappointed if they didn't.
[3:00:25] myguyhood: is there any reward from twisting? @Towelliee
[3:00:26] m__ber: yea but its all cosmetics from the twisting corridors so i dont think they mind it being gated
[3:00:29] Vigi9413: One my warrior won't just be a shout bitch
[3:00:30] PadidinJones: I feel that it will be gated until next raid tier. This is the way @Towelliee
[3:00:33] datyty: Twisting corridor quest? Wtf is that
[3:00:48] weirdsp4ce: switched to kyrian. ugh I hate redoing all these quests
[3:00:51] N3llee: what is twisting corridor?
[3:01:00] verm1111: what is the twisting corridor
[3:01:01] Roughneck124: I miss the week of Christmas. So I‚Äôm behind one week I guess
[3:01:04] Endy253: Morning Towliee
[3:01:06] nixxy_7: lool chat...
[3:01:07] Vigi9413: is it all 18 floors today?
[3:01:09] kalamari__: I think it would be good when you have at leat do all quests once on your main and then it unlocks for everyone else
[3:01:15] Belirs: i missed 1 turn in that only gave gold cause i didnt wait for an npc that despawned on me to reach bolvar :(
[3:01:16] huntero: what is twisting corridors? Kappa
[3:01:17] Undying_faith: Its a faction
[3:01:18] WiizyWeeds: woah woah what is this u speak of
[3:01:18] tlolod: i dont even know what is that twisting corridor
[3:01:21] ginzinco: Maw mount from it
[3:01:23] raldrik: Wow needs to come up with something to counter the grass is greener people going to newworld this year (if it actually comes out)
[3:01:25] TheRiwen: and not going to
[3:01:28] TMMOOF: I stopped playing on floor 5 of torghast :(
[3:01:29] N3llee: Yea I dont know what twisting corridor is sorry.. been doing eveything daily.
[3:01:33] metavahn231: i saved thrall or whatever
[3:01:34] Tyrandian: Feels really punishing to new players.
[3:01:35] Cypfer: Maw mount but i don't even do the Maw, i'm fine LUL
[3:01:37] knigghtmare: is it worth to even do that?
[3:01:37] zigzugg: @Towelliee do you know what the Torghaast event next week is?
[3:01:39] thebakeriscomingforu: Part of me thinks the pains we are experiencing is just difficulty for the world race. Now that it and the holidays are over with I can see hot fixes
[3:01:39] speedyweedy22: thats stupid they should let ppl fast track the quest line
[3:01:41] Odinslayer: what the last quest for the twisting corridors?
[3:01:49] Findlyn: I think they rely to much on third party sites now to get out information like that. They need to make more stuff known easier in game
[3:01:50] Auru: get the mount once u dont need it
[3:01:50] Vitalsigns64: imagine doing the maw LUL
[3:01:51] N3llee: AD
[3:01:52] nixxy_7: layer 8 might be crazy with the debuffs torments

[3:01:59] Boomie82: do we know, how hard twisting corridors will be?!
[3:01:59] Emonk666: is that this weird thorgast questline?
[3:02:01] Vigi9413: are the cosmetics good in torghast?
[3:02:01] datyty: Damn unless by chance I haven‚Äôt don‚Äôt any twisted corridor quest
[3:02:05] ShadyWizWolf: Jebaited

[3:02:48] lazy_pandabear: 18 floors???
[3:02:49] hectabit: that is a lot

[3:03:43] byrdeen45: Just hope i get good gloves in the chest today
[3:03:45] Boomhauwer: Are you taking the monk or pally today?
[3:03:52] ticonis: look at calendar
[3:03:56] kharnij83: twisting corridors should be like the mage tower challenge where u unlock new weapon skins and shit
[3:03:58] nixxy_7: Look Calendar
[3:04:00] Lynxide: Check the calendar
[3:04:04] kharnij83: or is it?
[3:04:08] chrslp: Anyone have success doing Torghast as a shadow priest? So damn squishy
[3:04:09] NVbrutal: dont think its gated some people already have twisted corridors unlocked cause of a quest bug

[3:04:35] Kromede: 1 more pet i gues KEKWlaugh
[3:04:36] jackson_tc: they going with POE approach or something?
[3:04:38] nixxy_7: special monsters added to torghast from what i read
[3:04:41] nixxy_7: not sure what that means
[3:04:48] Getitonthelow: so I switched mains twice.. that means I'm 2-3 weeks behind on the quest
[3:05:01] brazkat: i rerolled 2nd week
[3:05:04] dundunnorway: 1hr and 27 minutes to vault for ya?
[3:05:15] GlakusWoW: isnt the twisting corridors suposed to be hard? like mage tower @Towelliee
[3:05:20] EricKerensky: dafuq is the music getting all funky for anyone else?
[3:05:24] datyty: I‚Äôm like 10 weeks behind
[3:05:24] nixxy_7: Blizzard Reasonable? pardon me.. Activision reasonable?? NO WAYY... didnt saw what happened to Destiny and COD
[3:05:27] Vigi9413: I might have to ditch the warrior
[3:05:44] Brunhiltt: Bruh blizzard must gate everything as much as possible,
[3:05:46] nixxy_7: They lost destiny bc they were unreasonable... its expected of activision money milk
[3:05:52] Sionz: it must be the "industry Standard"
[3:05:56] Odinslayer: am confused, aint the last quest we got is the saving thrall one?
[3:05:57] datyty: Oh then I‚Äôm not worried about it
[3:06:00] Stafunoob: what they need to do is have layer unlocks account wide
[3:06:02] Blakimas: Yeah it would be better to have a way to catch up. Especially with the holidays, I definitely missed a couple weeks.
[3:06:04] Veegore: they'll probably wait a week after everyone that kept up has had a chance to finish
[3:06:04] Ramstein: CHALKING it up, not CHOPPING it up @Towelliee :p
[3:06:09] Chrysophylax_I: Well doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone is really working on the game right now so don‚Äôt get your hopes up
[3:06:12] Bounty4321: @Towelliee It's the same thing with Anima, you complete challenges to unlock cosmetics but then need 12k anima just to buy it with there being no way of farming anima.
[3:06:17] roundishh: Will the mount be account wide?
[3:06:34] TheVigiliance: How long until the vault opening?
[3:06:42] datyty: @roundishh yea just looked it up
[3:06:43] speedyweedy22: yes its account wide
[3:06:47] Mogolo: @Bounty4321 u can farm anima what u talking about
[3:06:48] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs meant to be a long term reward. Likes months out you unlock that stuff
[3:06:55] duffluv22: Loot!!!!!
[3:06:55] nixxy_7: Anima farm is crap... you need lke 17-20k just for each area for +3 upgrades and then you need 100k + anima just to buy that crap from the vendor... area...
[3:07:01] RunningOutOfRAM: Droping more anima in mythic + kreygasm
[3:07:03] zigzugg: BOA flight p oints
[3:07:03] Belirs: make mythic bosses drop 200 instead of 35 anima
[3:07:07] nixxy_7: how the heck we gonna farm 100k anima just for 1-2 items..
[3:07:19] nastymf_: What‚Äôs in twisting corridors?
[3:07:27] swordwindgaming: The Truth.
[3:07:30] Belirs: OMEGALUL
[3:07:34] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Yeah, and it feels awful. Completing the achievement and then having to farm a currency to buy it just doesn't feel good at all
[3:07:35] Brunhiltt: gotta milk them casuals
[3:07:35] Amarlian: after maintenance @TheVigiliance which starts in 24 mins
[3:07:35] Belirs: OMEGALUL for 3 items
[3:07:37] datyty: When you kill a raid boss and get 1x 35 anima >>>
[3:07:40] nixxy_7: Its Activision..... what you expect
[3:07:41] NVbrutal: lol fuck anima need to improve those gear drops doing 10 dungeons with 0 loot is just bad design.
[3:07:43] Veegore: The forgot to turn wing 2 on
[3:07:45] Redacted_: how the hell do you do the 1000 anima weekly if you dont do the dungeon quests?
[3:07:47] nixxy_7: More money sounds good
[3:07:52] snuffles_80: the rewards for WQ are ridicilously low

[3:07:56] Strayer_J: is there anything wrong with that
[3:07:57] teqnikirl: @Towelliee Gating LFR doesn't retain subs, it loses subs.
[3:08:06] DoritoGaming_: Would you get more subs if you fixed the problems that people dont like
[3:08:09] swordwindgaming: @Brunhiltt they're milking everybody
[3:08:10] nastymf_: @towelliee what‚Äôs in twisting corridors?
[3:08:10] fredAsavage: @Redacted_ a whole WHOLE bunch of WQ
[3:08:11] Getitonthelow: nothing like clearing a whole raid and get 1 item...
[3:08:15] Cakedonut: I'm so casual that I still haven't done a mythic dungeon danCry
[3:08:16] othraerir: 3 weeks huh, so that's prolly 2 subs for 2 unlocks of lfr
[3:08:16] Ventrix_: @Nixieed Blizzard has more board members than Activision. but yep, keep blaming the boogeyman LUL
[3:08:16] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 So what do you plan to do for content for the next several months?
[3:08:18] ZyntosAran: @Redacted_ do the world quests every day. WQ per day are like 700 anima
[3:08:20] xLink_tv: WQs arent even worth doing
[3:08:23] D3m0nHunt3r666: you tell them towelliee tastelessRage
[3:08:24] nixxy_7: They probably have no content and are delaying content by months @Towelliee
[3:08:25] Slowkill333: @Towelliee I have already cancelled my sub. I just don't have as much time to play and have no desire to play alts anymore.
[3:08:27] Beff_Jridges: i feel like they recreated the loot issue of vanilla that they fixed in TBC. the badge system
[3:08:30] Krayt360: @teqnikirl are there people actually running lfr to gear up?
[3:08:31] BlinkHeals: nice to hear from soemone getting paid by them to actually tell it like it is
[3:08:32] Bacon_21: 35 anima for you, you, and you. Don't forget to keep subbed to us!
[3:08:32] Brunhiltt: @swordwindgaming trueee
[3:08:39] datyty: Where do you get anima unless world quest?
[3:08:43] Bacon_21: Kappa
[3:08:45] Hammerpain: i agree wholeheartedly, takes forever to get anima, soul ash, etc
[3:08:47] flowgo12: they need more gear drop
[3:08:48] Deadly26: Legion was a better expansion than Shadowlands :(
[3:08:51] nixxy_7: @Ventrix_ activision owns most of blizzard , its just by name mostly even a lot of devs left in the past when activision took over
[3:08:51] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I PvP, that's about it... nothing else feels rewarding and just makes you feel like an idiot for even putting in the effort lol

[3:08:56] Odinslayer: they need to up the amount of end of dungeon anima, hell even in bfa we got more AP xD
[3:08:57] teqnikirl: @Krayt360 there won't be. Thats the point. By the time they stop gating it, nobody will need it.
[3:08:58] othraerir: do you think we will get more anima for wq in the future?
[3:08:59] ZyntosAran: @datyty bascially everywhere. dungeons, raids, pvp
[3:09:02] Belirs: why do covenant conduits come from world bosses rather then the story campaign NotLikeThis ?!
[3:09:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: TW dungeon drops were way tooooooo low
[3:09:04] Redacted_: @FredSavageNC @ZyntosAran oh really? i didnt think they would add up to that much per day
[3:09:04] SpoofAvatar: usually 1k anima on the board, easy to get 6-7k per week
[3:09:10] MrJ195: gzgzgzgzgzgz
[3:09:10] fredAsavage: @datyty Weekly dungeon quests, mythic +, pvp
[3:09:10] Anderus00: towHAMUP DING towHAMUP
[3:09:20] Rimstar: How is twisting corridors?
[3:09:21] datyty: @zyntosaran yea but WQ is faster tho right
[3:09:23] fabrizioserra26: 35 anima power for killing a raid boss or doing a high M+ sucks
[3:09:25] Krayt360: @teqnikirl 187 gear is pretty useless to begin with, when you get 184 from m0
[3:09:26] chrslp: Do you do your Ember Court Towelliee?
[3:09:29] Cakedonut: doing 10 WQ a day for anima is no fun
[3:09:32] ZyntosAran: @datyty yeah
[3:09:42] datyty: @zyntosaran thanks
[3:09:42] suggartown: 18 renown is max currently correct?
[3:09:42] teqnikirl: @Krayt360 exactly.
[3:09:43] nixxy_7: @GDmonger 6-7k a week? get out of here... you do 16+hours pvp if not ... stop lie you cant get hta much per week
[3:09:48] fredAsavage: @Redacted_ oh, its definitely not efficient. It CAN be done but I sure wouldn't want to spend that much time on WQ
[3:09:51] Belirs: @suggartown yes
[3:09:52] Krayt360: @teqnikirl minus the load of stupid you encounter in lfr
[3:09:54] Ventrix_: @Nixieed and thats wrong. no on took anything over. the combined their stock unto a holding (activison blizzard) where both companies have shares and board members... and blizzard has more and controlling power. you can google the facts
[3:10:01] nixxy_7: @GDmonger i only pve and i cant get hta tmuch all wq clear at cd spawn... you cant get that much 7k anima per week
[3:10:01] BurtMacklin410: i've just been buying the item from venari to get all my conduit upgrades lol
[3:10:03] suggartown: Thanks
[3:10:11] Belirs: i missed 1 weekly quest by accident and didnt even notice it
[3:10:11] Chrysophylax_I: I @bounty4321 thats fair. I just like having to grind for stuff. It makes it more valuable for me. I want to be proud wearing my anima transmog and not see everyone else wearing it
[3:10:12] Cypfer: I swapped mains and i got renown to max in 2-3 days that was nice
[3:10:18] SpoofAvatar: sure ya can, there is about 1k per day on the board
[3:10:22] Veegore: Just gained 5 renown levels on my bear this morning in the last 2 hours
[3:10:23] Broomba: Broomba subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 100 months, currently on a 100 month streak! 100 years subbed to the man!!! NightFae for the Win!
[3:10:24] Veras_7: its really not easy to switch renown.. you need to farm 1k anima like 5x right now to catch up.. its annoying af
[3:10:24] nixxy_7: @GDmonger and farming dungeons for like 7+hours daily... still 3-4k per week... prove me wrong link it
[3:10:31] weirdsp4ce: I'm kyrian, it would let me get past 7 this whole week
[3:10:36] weirdsp4ce: wouldnt
[3:10:37] Krintario: I did 3 hours of arena and got 1 renown lol
[3:10:38] brozzy: bruh i got one drop from raid this week and it was the bag wtf
[3:10:42] BurtMacklin410: yep lowest
[3:10:50] RyanSMcCann: At launch Didnt most people hit 60 in Ardenweld - have they changed the XP ?
[3:11:00] nixxy_7: renown for weekly quests resets
[3:11:01] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I I get that, and I'd love to farm Anima is there was a way to truly farm it. WQ and 35 Anima per dungeon don't count IMO if that makes sense?
[3:11:07] Zebingt0n: sadly, potency only come at 200 highest atm.
[3:11:07] Redacted_: @FredSavageNC yeah i switched covenants on an alt and already did the dungeon weeklys, got the 1000 anima quest again and didnt know what to do
[3:11:07] Bounty4321: if there was***
[3:11:09] Darthyrevan: Callings too
[3:11:13] MugginsTV: You‚Äôre correct on just about everything your talking about @towelliee I can‚Äôt see myself sticking around much longer than another few weeks or so (casual player)
[3:11:14] Zebingt0n: wihtout venari
[3:11:17] othraerir: callings as well
[3:11:19] CatformTV: even Worldboss gives Renown
[3:11:21] Belirs: doing 1 hc nets you 2-4 renown as well
[3:11:22] moonscryer: if you swap a covenant you can have renown redone in a day currently if you do it.
[3:11:30] nixxy_7: Yap everything
[3:11:35] Bereska: Bereska subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! towBlue
[3:11:36] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 I get like 4-5k a week just doing random stuff
[3:11:37] nixxy_7: just to stay in pace with the rest
[3:11:37] Cakedonut: what is max renown before today?
[3:11:37] fredAsavage: @Redacted_ smack your head against the wall that is WQ haha
[3:11:38] Forrestra: One of my alts got 2 renown from a single LFR wing
[3:11:42] Anderus00: do alllllll the things Kappa
[3:11:48] swordwindgaming: @RyanSMcCann you hit 60 in Venthyrland just doing quests and with WM off
[3:11:49] uzury: basically play the game and u get renown
[3:11:51] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP morning
[3:11:52] DemonicGrizz: I just wish the bg ques were not so damn long been trying to get honor through there but I end up sitting in ques for ever
[3:11:58] pvtpilot88: @Towelliee I found that if you complette the weekly quest early there is an issue where you cannot get to max renown stuck at 16 this last week on one of my alts
[3:11:59] Yarriq: @Cakedonut 18
[3:12:05] iwipemyownazz: I'm a shadow priest main so im necrolord, however in arena i'm disc so i think im gonna have to go venth for pvp mindgames is so damn strong !

[3:12:22] OmikronTV: @Towelliee Any update on when the Prot Paladin buffs might happen?
[3:12:25] snuffles_80: I always get holy or ret conduit upgrades froom rewards..Im prot
[3:12:27] RyanSMcCann: @swordwindgaming I hit 60 1/3 of the way through Ardenweld
[3:12:31] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Yes, which you also need for your mission table and Sanctum upgrades. Everything Anima is tied to does not affect player power so I just don't see the reason for not having a true grind available.
[3:12:33] Sollice: Welcome to the Golden Hammer club
[3:12:35] flowgo12: Is Venthyr the way to go for Paladins ?
[3:12:40] Odinslayer: you can get to 60 and take the fate choice and you can skip the campaign

[3:12:50] kharnij83: to u lose the xmog from a covenant if u change the covenant?
[3:12:54] kharnij83: do *
[3:13:00] zulway_: @snuffles_80 I always get prot conduits and I am holy LMAO
[3:13:13] Voidheim: yes and no @kharnij83
[3:13:22] Voidheim: you can't use them if you aren't in the covenant
[3:13:40] Voidheim: but if you have another toon in that covenant then they still can use them
[3:13:48] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I For example, I'd love if they brought back 3 chesting in Legion and increases Anima drops based on how well you did and what key level it was.... Mists could be the new Maw of Souls and it would be very fun lol
[3:13:49] Chrysophylax_I: I don‚Äôt think Blizz has a specific motive for updates right now. I think they have just been chilling and taking time off over the holidays, but it‚Äôs time to get back to work and fix the crap ASAP.
[3:14:05] Odinslayer: alts of same cov yea
[3:14:06] kharnij83: im assuming in the future u will be able to
[3:14:44] Odinslayer: correct
[3:14:51] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I I think that was the last time I enjoyed M+? Legion 3 Chesting and Maw of Souls haha
[3:14:55] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 That‚Äôs a good idea. I think down the road the will implement some anima farm. They also do with those systems
[3:14:57] Odinslayer: in 9.4 LULW
[3:15:18] Kneckt: Kneckt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[3:15:27] datyty: I chose the vampire cov for my warrior purely for the armor
[3:15:30] kharnij83: so where do u think the next expansion is going togo story wise
[3:15:31] wreaveit: when i have the tmog unlocked on my druid, do i get the full set on my twink dk?
[3:15:53] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Yeah, just some different ways for us to do the grind is all I want really. Like if you and I put in a ton of time we get it sooner VS having to wait for WQ to spawn haha
[3:15:58] kharnij83: strongest foes have basically been used after this
[3:16:04] zulway_: how many more raids do you think we get this xpac? blizzard said they wanted to go for a different scheduele for content updates this time around right?
[3:16:08] CatformTV: @Towelliee whats next max renown this reset?
[3:16:13] Chrysophylax_I: I find myself asking a lot this exp ‚Äúdo the devs even play the game‚Äù?

[3:16:26] Atralumen: Hey man, I'm pulling like 1.7k dps single target and i'm ilvl 194 as prot pally. I've shooken up talents and I have both the SOTR lego and the infinite shield toss lego. Do you think that's about right? I'm trying to push keys
[3:16:28] Wildtiger21: Going to the Brightland and attack the light
[3:16:28] nixxy_7: @Towelliee Probably the Pantheon of Life, we are in the Pantheon of Death now, so there must be a Pantheon of Life too revives something who knows
[3:16:28] swordwindgaming: At this point, who even cares where the story is going? Blizzard literally pulled the Shadowlands out of nowhere.
[3:16:29] thebakeriscomingforu: cosmic war is my guess.
[3:16:29] Lockrocker: BFA 2.0?
[3:16:31] MrArrig: blizz writers haven't had fried their brains with enough drugs yet
[3:16:35] Tyrandian: I really don't want Sylvanas redemption. I feel like it would be a cop out.
[3:16:38] kharnij83: alliance turns into the bad guys ands horde to the good lul
[3:16:39] Wildtiger21: w

[3:16:46] idenkaz_: void lords are end end game material
[3:16:47] Antdavs24: sylvanas redemption... shocker NotLikeThis
[3:16:47] PadidinJones: Tyrande is gunna turn into a lich queen.
[3:16:48] swordwindgaming: I don't think most of the player base cares about the story at this rate.
[3:16:51] Finaldestinii: Finaldestinii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[3:16:55] tlolod: Another alternate world plz

[3:17:08] Redacted_: the first ones
[3:17:10] Sollice: Tyrande is going to kill Sylvanas. Guaranteed. And Sylvanas will probably realize all the bad she has done and when she fights Tyranda she will let herself be killed.
[3:17:10] datyty: Blizzard writers throwing shit at the wall and see what sticks.
[3:17:13] coldb333r: I actually think that we are gonna get a new faction
[3:17:13] tezrelli: first ones = murlocs

[3:17:24] nixxy_7: @Towelliee we only know the First ones is the Jailer , or was one of them and was exiled in the pantheon of DEATH and this is his jail we dont know what the others are like
[3:17:24] Deadly26: Sylvanas redemption and then whatever other cosmic force gets angry
[3:17:26] faetilwind: Ancient ones
[3:17:26] kharnij83: AS LONG as MAGNI and khadgar stay away

[3:17:38] Bounty4321: @coldb333r Dark Age of Camelot 3 faction PvP? Yas please
[3:17:38] jackson_tc: gotta reload the draenor save for the second time to set things right

[3:17:54] swordwindgaming: Sylvanas aint dying thats crazy. Shes more popular than Thrall.
[3:17:54] kharnij83: She will be the new jailor
[3:17:56] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Yas! <3 Even if it's just cosmetics I'll take it lol

[3:18:19] Sollice: They killed Arthas....At least for a while
[3:18:19] Belirs: if there was the option to help sylvanas in SL id probably do that :)
[3:18:20] Betrys: they killed off varian and voljin
[3:18:21] swordwindgaming: Varian died because he was only popular Alliance side.

[3:19:20] Betrys: im so down of evil anduin
[3:19:20] Wulfgrym: just a reminder we still have a giant sword sticking out of Azeroth
[3:19:27] moonscryer: i'm waiting for the lootboxes on the Shop...Modern Warfare: Warcraft
[3:19:30] nixxy_7: @Towelliee Sylvanas is one of the cosmic death realms owners , the Forsaken she transformed the forsaken to save them from Arthas Realm of the Damned after turning, then there is the maw where all azeroth souls go other types.... of living beings.... and then there is Calia Menethil... she is not undead but shes not alive... so shes is a new undead army entity
[3:19:30] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Yeah I'm not sure what their designers are thinking. As a designer myself the only thing I can think of is this reminds me of when I do work for mobile gaming studios... in the sense that they want you to design for metrics and revenue first before fun
[3:19:35] Nougat_V: nah, the light is strong in menduin, he will slay them all
[3:19:35] Sollice: Get rid of the factions. WoW: The Melting Pot expansion
[3:19:36] Stafunoob: I'm just ready for the Jailer's Forces to invade Oribos and we have to fight the Arbitor
[3:19:37] Cypfer: Next expansion we go back to past before all the main cities were built
[3:19:38] Antdavs24: we fight anduin and sylvanas is the one who gets us to free him from the jailers grasp NotLikeThis
[3:19:40] DeezBaggins: so he soul binds audin
[3:19:42] kokochris: As a life time Horde player; I cant wait to punch that little wus in the face
[3:19:43] LegalizeShroomZZ: that sword as a transmog monkaSoap
[3:19:44] Havico_Gaming: not Velen
[3:19:46] ormy86: they have teased Anduin going to Void too much to have him turn to Death!
[3:19:48] sinlessuk: it would be a good time for a city or two to be attcked while all the heros and leaders are away
[3:19:49] Betrys: im so into the idea of evil anduin
[3:19:53] Wulfgrym: @Sollice world of peacecraft?
[3:19:54] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee can Full Power Anduin beat Medan, though?
[3:19:57] srtownz: but my shaman can mass rez too
[3:19:58] Sollice: lol
[3:20:09] Its_Me_MG: and to think that pansy ass Anduin came out of Varien's nutsack
[3:20:13] Sollice: Anduin becomes the new Jailer
[3:20:15] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Wish I was making that up, they actually make you design the meta game and monetization systems BEFORE there is even a game lmao
[3:20:16] nixxy_7: Anduin vilan voice would be FUN
[3:20:17] Brickneim: fortnite lich king inc
[3:20:22] kokochris: They wont keep him in that form for long. probably by the end of SL he will go back
[3:20:24] Sandsonic: The shadow anduiin from hearthstone was sick
[3:20:28] PadidinJones: They gave him a sarcastic voice for 5 seconds!!
[3:20:28] icemanj99: Yeah, but then we have to deal with Turalyon as the Alliance leader.
[3:20:28] birdnorf: ya, I have a real hard time taking Anduin seriously
[3:20:33] KVANNORWICK: The last raid of the expansion will be Thorghast, and we will reach the top and end up fighting Anduin at the top of Ice Crown after taking some portal.
[3:20:34] Cypfer: Piss piss piss
[3:20:35] luckfore: There must always be a jailer

[3:20:41] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 Yep that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been thinking too. I know nothing about game design, but as a player for the last 14 years, I can immediately point out issues that need fixed to make the game better.
[3:20:43] Odinslayer: KEKW
[3:20:44] sinlesssinner: nothing happening to any of our leaders right now.. they wont do it again like they did in BFA..
[3:20:45] zhouqt: idiot hagi
[3:20:46] Elemental1313: ive always wondered now with the shadow lands expansion, is resurecting people pulling their soul from the shadowlands back into their body?
[3:20:47] Todmeister9000: KEKW
[3:20:52] TSquadSully: pre pubescent lich king LUL

[3:20:57] Shrenko: D:
[3:20:58] swordwindgaming: DX but he saved the Horde
[3:20:58] BrewCityMonk: kill himself

[3:21:27] Rimstar: wheres garrosh and arthas though
[3:21:28] NewWorldReign: Genn is literally Anduins lapdog.

[3:21:29] hobano890: genn double teams anduin

[3:21:43] logdrop69: Hey towelliee, prot pally tank here. My guild has been stuck on heroic sire for a bit. Any recommendations on dealing with stuff like nighthunter and add management?
[3:21:44] TheUnknowing: Genn just wants anduin to get his dick wet
[3:21:44] Panadol324: ALL will be swallow BY THE VOID !!!
[3:21:45] akia03: wraithion dumped andiun now hes mad
[3:21:46] Phyce_: sylvanas is reformed by the winter queen and anduin marries her xD
[3:21:47] zeeAbe: Maybe they expecting Anduin getting laid would grow some hairs on his chest and make his balls drop
[3:21:52] luckfore: He will hook up with sylvanus
[3:21:52] nixxy_7: @Towelliee jaina loves thrall thrall likes her too ... you saw how they eye one another... i think thrall will have a kid before Anduin will have a GF
[3:21:57] rauko_64: @Towelliee he becomes the new lich king and fucks the jailer up and becomes the new lord of shadowlands thus fucking the alliance.... again
[3:21:58] pavepawns: i think we are gonna see sylvanas and anduin try to turn on jailor then they fail. anduin gets turned into a baddie and then either sylvanas dies or she gets turned into a more evil baddie
[3:21:59] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 Like pay me for a few hours a week to catch bugs for you.

[3:22:22] Antdavs24: pent up in his balls from all the sex he aint having Kappa
[3:22:25] icemanj99: Or he'll turn emo
[3:22:26] Megadisaster24: What if Anduin brings Sylvanas back?
[3:22:26] Undying_faith: Him and Sylvannas gonna make babies.
[3:22:27] moejimbo: unleash the mega blue balls!
[3:22:28] kharnij83: Anduin will turn bad and sometime we will see Varian come out and help him turn back
[3:22:28] Sollice: They did say they were going to do to Alliance with what they did with Horde. The Alliance is going to come in to some real inter fighting soon
[3:22:30] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I I know they probably have great designers who are trying to make the game better but just can't pitch it to execs since they don't have and data to back up how it will improve revenue
[3:22:31] Belirs: maybe he marries sylvanas POGGERS and the son becomes the next lichking/queen
[3:22:31] Wulfgrym: Anduin goes crazy on azeroth till his father appears
[3:22:40] pavepawns: well varian velen and genn
[3:22:44] pavepawns: are keeping him together
[3:22:45] Sincline387: Varyian is in the soulstone dude.....

[3:23:00] RunningOutOfRAM: LMFAO :D
[3:23:00] nixxy_7: Trueee
[3:23:03] kharnij83: Son i KNEW u were a pussy from the start get out of here
[3:23:04] jure__: yo, if I already killed a boss in a raid and get invited where the boss is still alive, can I just do the boss and not get loot or will they have to kick me?
[3:23:07] tezrelli: maybe anduin turns stormwind a new icrown citadel
[3:23:08] TembaWrites: lol
[3:23:08] Hazcore: when will we find varian in the shadowlands
[3:23:10] D3m0nHunt3r666: let me die in peace Kappa
[3:23:13] GoGetItKo: D: Towelliee Lore is different. I don't like it Kappa
[3:23:13] NewWorldReign: Honestly, I think Sylvanas will have to kill Anduin just to save everybody. Why do you think she missed 2 fucking chances to do it in the last expansion? @Towelliee
[3:23:15] shifty86: his soul was disintegrated, he cant be in the shadowlands lol
[3:23:20] Stafunoob: OHHH> What if the Jailer has Varian and is using him to break Anduin
[3:23:26] Panadol324: and by the way : ARthas was your father !! :D
[3:23:26] logdrop69: Hey towelliee, prot pally tank here. My guild has been stuck on heroic sire for a bit. Any recommendations on dealing with stuff like nighthunter and add management?
[3:23:31] Kriven: Varian just trying to enjoy his eternal retirement like.. This mother fucker keeps calling me
[3:23:33] Czyszn: Anduin is a Bobo
[3:23:33] panzmat: @jure__ you can do it again and get no loot, unless its mythic
[3:23:33] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 Yeah but then you look at the hot fixes for today and it‚Äôs ‚Äúfixed voiceover for random quest‚Äù, ‚Äúremoved duplicate quest npc‚Äù like that crap does nothing for the game
[3:23:34] billybaroo1: yes, wouldn't wanna interupt happy time Kappa
[3:23:36] Dyasis: @jure__ you just wont get loot, but it also removes loot for the other players
[3:23:36] itsagentscully: anduins giving us corruption traits back
[3:23:36] Brickneim: he clears out lordearon
[3:23:37] Its_Me_MG: he isnt in the Shadowlands, he was consumed with Fel Energy
[3:23:39] Its_Me_MG: KEKW
[3:23:42] ciranidd: Floating Citadel Lorderon
[3:23:42] Boomhauwer: All because he didn't get laid. What a story that could be
[3:23:47] nixxy_7: @shifty86 we had more tragic deaths and they are still in shadowlands.. body disentegrated not soul soul is a different thing and shape
[3:23:49] jure__: @jure__ ok thx dudes
[3:23:55] PanoramicPanda: Isn't Varian gone? His soul was used in fel magic.
[3:23:55] Moobot: Towelliee is sponsored by G FUEL! The official energy drink of ESPORTS and THE HAMMER SQUAD! towHAMUP Use code ‚û° TOWEL ‚¨Ö at checkout! gfuel.ly/3kf8stb
[3:23:59] shifty86: he cantttttttttt, he cannot be in the shadowlands at all. his soul s gone
[3:24:04] pavepawns: all we know is that he fckin got popped like a zit by guldan
[3:24:05] gimmlay: they need anduin to kill the void lord in torghast
[3:24:07] Belirs: doesnt fell energy send you into the great darkness ?
[3:24:08] AdmiralPants: Yeah I though varians soul got deleted by fel when guldan killed him
[3:24:09] Kyrrua: what if Anduin always win anyway ?
[3:24:09] luckfore: hes a pile of ash infront of Tomb of Sargeras
[3:24:10] Megadisaster24: he might be in the Twisting Nether
[3:24:11] nixxy_7: @shifty86 wow lore works different then fizics... souls live on even if your body gets destroyed
[3:24:11] X_KL3PT0_X: where saurfangh
[3:24:14] dpbdagger: Anyone know which torghast it is this week? Waiting on legos:(
[3:24:15] kokochris: I think just time in SL is not the same; so he may not have been "processed" yet. You know take a number like the DMV
[3:24:15] PanoramicPanda: was used as fuel
[3:24:19] GiraffeHydra_: Jailer at him, only possibility
[3:24:23] GiraffeHydra_: ate*
[3:24:26] Kriven: he is secretly a swolekin
[3:24:27] robertjordan83: @Towelliee he's in the 9/2 zone
[3:24:28] TheUnknowing: probably in the maw @X_KL3PT0_X
[3:24:29] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Yeah, though with them just coming back from break and mostly being remote I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for a couple days... could be wrong but if they don't do anything in a couple days then idk what to say.
[3:24:35] akia03: isnt that light dude king in stormwind now?
[3:24:36] d1stract10n: wasn't kal'thas infused with the sunwell that was powered by the legion?
[3:24:40] ormy86: so Varian and Tirion are nowhere?
[3:24:44] Belirs: CouldYouNot
[3:24:48] nixxy_7: GENN will be the King

[3:25:09] Jors91: OH NO... anyway
[3:25:12] aikopooh: LUL
[3:25:14] SmarfTV: I think it's likely that they will add additional Shadowlands zones in later patches, so Varian might be there
[3:25:16] N3llee: TRUE
[3:25:17] kokochris: "uh noes..."
[3:25:18] DeezBaggins: he did try to help but he tripped on a rock
[3:25:19] nixxy_7: Gen was hoping for someone to kidnapp anduin for 5000+ years
[3:25:23] VagueeAbstract: VagueeAbstract subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:25:24] X_KL3PT0_X: she wanted to take his kid like figure
[3:25:26] mmrghost7: where is my corrrrrridors
[3:25:27] icemanj99: Turalyon will be worse imo. He's on the extreme end of the light

[3:25:35] moejimbo: ahh... crap this "champion" dude... is gunna save him
[3:25:35] Zeiserig: Genn be like : OH no .... anyways :DDDD
[3:25:36] MourvinMad: Genn pulled a Daria and reached out his hand after it was too late
[3:25:37] NewWorldReign: Turalyon and Alleria as King and Queen of SW.
[3:25:37] Megadisaster24: Gen is a Worgen Warrior, there's nothing he can do, pretty useles
[3:25:37] ciranidd: He was rerolling his champ
[3:25:38] Edgelesslake: !addon
[3:25:42] Antdavs24: KEKW
[3:25:48] NOS_4EVR: haha yeah
[3:25:50] Bereska: Genn wasnt mans bestfriend that day
[3:25:52] Sollice: Well...His character though was a pussy thats why he didn't help take down Samuel L Jackson
[3:25:58] thecynicalshuffler: towelliee sounds like joe pecsi from leathal weapon. "ok ok ok ok... listen... ok ok ok ok" lol
[3:25:59] mrhyydd: That guy was classic
[3:26:00] Sollice: Genn isnt he just didnt want to help

[3:26:03] mrhyydd: soul glo
[3:26:05] Aethernext: LUL
[3:26:07] FresheFefe: there was no time
[3:26:08] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I They can, but it's very difficult for a studio of that size that doesn't normally do it. Typically the only remote work on the game done is by third party / contractors. Now the entire main team is remote so that kinda slows thing down
[3:26:17] duncon: Soul Glow lul
[3:26:20] Amarlian: I think I have security cam footage of that scene https://gfycat.com/blushingamplecarp-dundermifflin-scott
[3:26:24] WayneG947: Genn was busy posting on Twitter
[3:26:28] nixxy_7: @Towelliee and Gen is fast... gen is a Werewolf he moves fast and swift... we even saw him fight sylvanas and his FAST
[3:26:31] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 Ah good to know. That‚Äôs for the insight
[3:26:35] Ghalfall: @Towelliee quick question a friend of mine ran a halls key with you he was wondering how you aggroed the 2nd loyal stone born for the third boss to take it
[3:26:37] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I I used to work for Blizz (not long, just contract work) and the hierarchy is INSANELY complicated and takes forever to get the simplest thing approved lol
[3:26:40] duffluv22: To do what though? Hes a wolf for crying out loud
[3:26:46] Ghalfall: tame*
[3:26:49] d1stract10n: @Towelliee genn threw Anduin at them
[3:26:55] kokochris: thoughts and prayers to Anduin
[3:27:01] sinlesssinner: lol the alliance want anduin dead so bad :p
[3:27:02] moejimbo: "let us pray"
[3:27:03] CritcobainTV: Genn is that little dog in the meme with everything on fire saying "this is fine, everythings fine" KEKW
[3:27:06] mrhyydd: I loved the song in the commercial that was playing on the TV for Soul Glow. It was classic.
[3:27:08] nixxy_7: @duffluv22 werewolfs has superhuman speed and strength... they move faster then harpies or humans way faster
[3:27:10] idenkaz_: never.
[3:27:11] TMMOOF: Then we get to kill him right?
[3:27:18] mmrghost7: i want arthas back REEEEEEE
[3:27:19] Chrysophylax_I: @bounty4321 Makes sense. I appreciate the information
[3:27:20] Belirs: i hope he turns evil but in a holy kind of way
[3:27:22] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: i mean, if he grow a spine
[3:27:25] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee Genn be like #NotAgain when he saw Anduin be carried off.
[3:27:25] CritcobainTV: WutFace you can't say that
[3:27:27] DeanoTV: KEKW

[3:27:51] logdrop69: @PaleMuadDib Hey towelliee, prot pally tank here. My guild has been stuck on heroic sire for a bit. Any recommendations on dealing with stuff like nighthunter and add management?
[3:27:51] Mogwaimonk: Anduin becomes the next Sylvannas?!
[3:27:52] Oheson: Only Towelle can make an analogy of WoW to Coming to America. That is why you are the man!
[3:27:53] Bounty4321: @Chrysophylax_I Of course, fingers crossed we get what we want... really loving the core systems of the expansion.
[3:27:54] swordwindgaming: Anduin "Garrosh was right" Wrynn

[7:03:25] DokaDoxy: seems like waste of time
[7:03:26] wreckshoptv: what a rewarding game :P

[7:04:00] Bareno: 2 has the checkmark because it rewarded the pet...?
[7:04:02] Galadeon: narrator...... 10 hours later......
[7:04:04] SethSteckler: No soul ash from this, just cosmetics and stuff
[7:04:05] towellieeesboy: Towel you will not make it past layer 4 in your current gear
[7:04:06] Ballavar: becuase blizz is a small indie dev company and bugs are expected of course
[7:04:22] MrRodriguez: imagine being a druid. bye week
[7:04:30] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @MrRodriguez why tho?
[7:04:35] JukasZor: is the mount from layer 8 at least account wide?
[7:04:38] exyl1: @Panadol324 u can do it over a couples of months.. u know, if u enjoy it.. otherwise u dont have to ofc :)

[7:04:51] yadungoofed101: @JukasZor yes
[7:04:59] MrRodriguez: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect
[7:05:30] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: since i have 3 alts, yes i want that @MrRodriguez
[7:05:33] MrRodriguez: the value a druid gets for doing 8 layers with 18 floors. some PETS :D
[7:05:40] yadungoofed101: it's ~13 hours total to do all 8 layers. totally worth it for the account wide maw mount. It's that or farm the event in the maw for weeks
[7:05:42] raldrik: build... you just mean all the powers :)
[7:06:04] SethSteckler: @MrRodriguez but what does druid have to do with it? Can't you say any class would feel the same?
[7:06:08] Murlocz: Dude is this sound from Grizzly Hills? My favorite zone in entire WoW
[7:06:16] towellieeesboy: It's insulting they want us to do all these chores for no reward
[7:06:20] MrRodriguez: @SethSteckler a druid doesnt need a mount for maw dude
[7:06:38] yadungoofed101: totally better, especially considering the maw event has been buggy af
[7:06:43] MrRodriguez: hes already mounted with travel form
[7:06:52] SethSteckler: @MrRodriguez oh you're specifically talking the mount. I thought you just meant for all the other shit as well
[7:06:54] Gurgle_Firewater: im glad im done with maw
[7:06:54] vieno91: CAN wORGEN MOUNT UP WITH THEY RACIAL TRAIT?
[7:06:58] vieno91: oups caps
[7:07:01] Tunkwa: yes
[7:07:04] Ozolz: Imagine not being a druid LUL
[7:07:07] Samurai3434: is the maw mount on level 8? and is it guaranteed?
[7:07:08] Tunkwa: in teh maw running wild is a thing
[7:07:09] exyl1: @towellieeesboy u dont have to do it... not having rewards that gives u power is great because then ppl who find it fun can do it and people that dont can skip it :)
[7:07:10] exyl1: see
[7:07:13] Aidler: why again is a mount for the maw, from which you can't get anything usefull after Ve'nari is maxed out, important?
[7:07:13] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: arent there more rewards coming?
[7:07:14] Verothe3rd: Which layer now?
[7:07:20] SethSteckler: layer 3

[7:08:06] Amnesiac2170: floor 18 was unbeatable for me
[7:08:11] Amarlian: Your cow is Swol now!
[7:08:11] mr_scoobs: Same
[7:08:14] towellieeesboy: @exyl1 Blizz still wasting dev time and resources on somethign like this with no rewards for most of the work. There is a lack of content already.
[7:08:23] City_Of_Birth: is this layer 3?
[7:08:28] MeekPR4L: lack of content LUL
[7:08:32] Molvonos: Afflock: 56 powers, 5052 Phantasma, Floor 13.
[7:08:36] Amnesiac2170: flor 18 instakill after 4 min
[7:08:37] Molvonos: lol
[7:08:42] mr_scoobs: Is there any reason to run this at all after you get the mount?
[7:08:54] Aidler: @towelliee why is a mount for the maw, from which you can‚Äôt get anything usefull after Ve‚Äônari is maxed out, important?
[7:08:55] Breakadinn: scrain21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[7:09:03] exyl1: @towellieeesboy torgast is allrdy built.. adding layers together does not take resources.. but hey if u wanna be negative i wont stop u :)
[7:09:03] tacsquatch: soul ash @mr_scoobs
[7:09:05] yadungoofed101: @Aidler you think that your venari rep being maxed out makes the maw finished? besides the fact that there is going to be a lot more content added to the maw, a lot of people especially raiders still gotta farm stygia for sockets for constantly upgrading gear
[7:09:07] tacsquatch: legendary upgrades
[7:09:08] Boatroad: @Towelliee oen of them does chage all 4 , one 3, one 2 and one jsut it self so if you finbd that out its easy
[7:09:17] moejimbo: that's a lot of beef walkin around
[7:09:21] mr_scoobs: okay, good @tacsquatch
[7:09:26] towellieeesboy: @Aidler They are adding more to the maw and us that dont suffer through it now will be extremely behind
[7:09:53] Vashile: Each layer is 9 floors?
[7:10:04] SethSteckler: 18 floors
[7:10:08] MeekPR4L: @towellieeesboy Is their anything you like about the game?
[7:10:09] Vashile: oh
[7:10:18] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: why do ppl complain about smth they dont have to do?
[7:10:19] Bobsta_Goulart: Does this really take 13 hours? I just want a maw mount

[7:12:15] doomester: @Towelliee you just need to do Twisted Corridor on charecter to get the mount, yes?
[7:12:17] exyl1: @towellieeesboy tip, if u dont enjoy the game id recommend stop playing and finding a hobby you enjoy.
[7:12:24] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: some ppl are sying, that you should get around ilvl 220 to beat the whole otherwise it would be boring..such bs
[7:12:37] vieno91: exactly lol
[7:12:39] Calath: it's not the trash for some it's the bosses

[7:15:16] Creamklo: Are all of the twisting corridors unlocked or is it just layer 1`?

[7:15:59] Cabbageman007: I will literally never set foot in twisting hell
[7:16:04] gfield2k: @SethSteckler oh cool didn't know you could solo as a tank. I read it was 20 hours an takes a team
[7:16:06] zorthan76: died on 16 started again and got the third clue on floor 6
[7:16:46] SethSteckler: @gfield2k maybe later layers, but he's only on 3 right now and 200+ ilvl. He was just doing 130k+ DPS on Layer 2 so he's probably good for a few more layers if the powers are right
[7:16:54] shimwood: Bonestorm! Is Thrillho in here? PogChamp
[7:17:01] chopsaki: It‚Äôs suppose to be random but after a few runs they reuse same levels over and over. Meh
[7:17:08] Ludicruz: @Towelliee What power is that, that makes you big like that ?
[7:17:09] Creamklo: @Towelliee Are all of the twisting corridors unlocked or is it just layer 1`?
[7:17:14] thrillersan: there's a limit to how much cc you can do to bosses I believe
[7:17:20] taciturnrandom: BONESTORM
[7:17:21] gfield2k: okay thanks for the info @SethSteckler
[7:17:22] SethSteckler: @Creamklo you have to start at 1
[7:17:41] MeekPR4L: i wonder how much the carries will be LUL
[7:17:48] Creamklo: @SethSteckler but tjere is no gating like the other ones? you just need to fight your way up

[7:19:40] ciranidd: see you get this stuff.. and they nerfed ice chipper by half..
[7:19:43] Wcvechten: Wouldn't your knockback effect perma interrupt him anyways if you walk into him?
[7:19:43] moejimbo: Cant you see what the final boss is on broker floors sometimes? like an image will be sitting next to the broker?
[7:19:45] yunggluten: game... blouses

[7:21:20] towellieeesboy: You got this one towel. No way you clear layer 4 though without 230+ wep
[7:21:36] ZyntosAran: @Machine42593 did you do the torghast quest each week? Didnt miss one?
[7:21:36] JimKappa420: which layer is that?
[7:21:40] DatIndianSpice: Twisting corridors?
[7:21:46] MrRodriguez: as far as we now at least 6 layers are open and unlocked for alts after. so im sure all 8 are open

[7:24:18] SethSteckler: If only there was some sort of whistle they could give us as a reward. Something that allowed you to get to a flight master easily. Too bad nothing like that has ever existed
[7:24:22] Herandae: Are we really calling a cosmetic only thing for alt unfriendly. Is there even any reason to do it on multiple characters?
[7:24:26] Amarlian: It's more alt friendly than it has been in the past honestly. There are times when I feel i have done everything I want to do on my main for the week. So we can switch

[7:53:35] swordwindgaming: What layer is Towellie on right now?
[7:53:38] foxies_havocing: Torghast feels like a weekly nuisance now and not something you like to do but do it anyway

[7:56:08] exyl1: @kokochris yeah thats great, people being able to skip content they dont enjoy. For those who do enjoy it they can do it ofc.

[7:56:33] kokochris: @exyl1 thats no really the point. The point is the rewards aren't worth the effort.
[7:56:34] Whofedjawz: Do you think that there will be Oribos raid? @towelliee
[7:56:34] Amarlian: @zigcho Yes, twisting corridors

[7:57:54] prismaticdodo: How many floors are there on this one?
[7:58:01] Worgenrunt01: @Sloot egg man danW
[7:58:10] Rypick: @prismaticdodo 18 floors per layer\
[7:58:10] KingSlayerYotam: its just regular torghast
[7:58:16] Aeylid: monkaS monkaS monkaS monkaS monkaS monkaS
[7:58:17] KingSlayerYotam: but 20x times slower
[7:58:33] Worgenrunt01: @Aeylid act natural monkaS
[7:58:55] kokochris: @exyl1 I play to get gear. If the rewards is a single mount. thats not gonna last more than one time. Why would I prioritize raiding over this ? it becomes a less used feature. When it can be much more relevant if you add better rewards to it. You play, just like I do; to feel progression and continue to improve your characters
[7:59:02] exyl1: @Towelliee it doesnt slow u tho.. just looks like u are slower as your model is bigger
[7:59:20] TiredCarcass: he slow
[7:59:41] Melonbrew: What Layer is Towelliee on?
[7:59:46] Archiee: 3
[7:59:47] Amarlian: 3
[7:59:56] Nulter: whats your favourite part of this expansion?
[8:00:04] GameSlayer_TV: what talents does he use for prot?
[8:00:10] swordwindgaming: geez he worked up to layer 3 solo
[8:00:11] exyl1: @kokochris yeah then dont do it, i dont see what the problem is that not all content is progression focused.. shit imagine if they put player power in twisting corridors that would have been awful.
[8:00:12] swordwindgaming: what a beast
[8:00:14] glorifen: Ah, so you can do twisting on your alts if you've completed the quest on your main. If you'd want to for some reason.
[8:00:32] bidogau: GZ now freeze credit haha
[8:00:33] Layos005: monkaW

[8:00:43] GalaxyBananaa: buy new house?
[8:00:43] Archiee: Yeah. They're gonna make the final decision on your mortgage. basically you're done lol
[8:00:52] Exxcar: man... I was really hoping TC would save Torghast....
[8:01:03] bidogau: Yeah its a good thing to do throughout
[8:01:07] prismaticdodo: you can save it
[8:01:09] Masqerader: so nice to see your powers not bug out
[8:01:14] Masqerader: i constantly got "placeholder"
[8:01:36] Archiee: I don't see any reason they wouldn't approve you.
[8:01:45] Anteman752: The bank? Saying no!? They would never! (sarcasm)
[8:01:50] Voivode69: if the credit score is too low, maybe
[8:01:52] Sloot: im raiding what did he say about 226 hakkar?
[8:01:53] shmasherd: Only thing that could go wrong for you now would be if the home didnt appraise for the estimated value / purchase price
[8:01:54] JukasZor: the no usually would have come long before now assuming you didn't do anything dumb between pre-approval and now
[8:02:07] thels: @Towelliee that power works on friendly players - so much BM if you play with friendly casters :P
[8:02:11] Layos005: never seen that power
[8:02:17] mrelgaato: @Sloot Got it in hi chest
[8:02:18] kokochris: @exyl1 I probably wont; and comes back to my original statement. people with limited time wont spend it on this. its unfortunate, as this type of content could be alot more accessible to more people, if they keep it the way they have.
[8:02:19] Lockrocker: the Lizzo Special?
[8:02:22] wah7767: bellybump
[8:02:30] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee It also works against players. You can knock back your party members too!

[8:06:34] LspN: making a raid with anima powers would be fun LUL
[8:06:46] RageerPLZ: OMG OMG THE STEEL CHAIR!!!!!
[8:07:05] thels: @SwapT1_ - honestly it comes down to the first few floors with twisting corridors. If you get some good powers setting you up for the run it becomes easier.

[8:07:14] Exxcar: Also... Groping actually breaks Torghast even more @Towelliee
[8:07:21] GamingwithWilson: Did the endless Torghast floors open?
[8:07:36] hagmania: all this american nonsense, when a perfectly grand New Japan show just happened ;)
[8:07:36] bidogau: Optimised to face-to-roll
[8:07:42] Exxcar: Amazing to group
[8:07:42] Gapz: @Towelliee I was using touch of death on every GCD thanks to x5 cd reduction on GCD
[8:07:43] galinhoo: 50k melees
[8:07:44] Masqerader: Well u were lucky that half didn't bug out with placeholder, got to floor 14 with half your power count
[8:07:48] ciranidd: O.O if you are struggling to clear layer 1, doing the first 6 floors 3 times will get all the quest items
[8:07:49] Exxcar: it becomes an absolute joke
[8:07:55] j_bar111: This reminds me of corruption scaling at the end of BFA
[8:07:57] deygust: yea seems harder withb a group
[8:08:04] Phydeaux: 2 or 3 people in torghast is fun
[8:08:04] deygust: but ppl have told me its easier idk
[8:08:12] skoobz3: you can run with a tank 3 dps and a heals
[8:08:13] skoobz3: its a joke
[8:08:17] Dayszen: @Towelliee dont foget about the chest in the first room
[8:08:18] Phydeaux: tank and 2 dps feels good
[8:08:20] skoobz3: complete joke
[8:08:34] Sloot: i will lyshmo
[8:08:34] skoobz3: they nerf made it easy
[8:08:49] skoobz3: never tried it pre nerf
[8:08:50] Phydeaux: tank and healer still increases the health and dmg
[8:08:56] CaribSoul: I found my holy pally brings a ton of dps as well as heals - so I'm helping
[8:08:59] swampt1l: I wish there was a catch up mechanic for the quest though so rip me @thels
[8:09:03] Skrumpcious: get a monk healer and get the corrupted vivify ability on the monk, everything they heal will get an aoe dot on them that murders everything
[8:09:04] j_bar111: @Towelliee what if one of the powers was Twilight Dev LUL
[8:09:05] Gipetto: im glad towelliee never confirms to flavor of the month tanks
[8:09:07] Gezo: unless your healer is a shaman, they can give your party members hero that gives 70% haste every 30 sec
[8:09:08] Milenkan: @Towelliee is twisting corridors account wide once you unlock it or anyone know?
[8:09:10] Gipetto: prot4life
[8:09:11] Thewraith077: !layer
[8:09:15] Phydeaux: we stopped running 5 mans pre-nerf, might try it again then
[8:09:17] skoobz3: alting and doing torghast from 1-8 is not the life
[8:09:22] Layos005: did layer 6 both yesterday in a 5 man was ez mode
[8:09:32] bennythejet_ne: You guys know if they nerfed prot at all today?
[8:09:36] Zarbos: Calm down poor boss

[8:10:03] propwash80: @Towelliee so how many floors do you have to do for the mount? will you do all of them today?
[8:10:04] Phydeaux: I didn't see any patch notes other than removing pet battles from Castle Nathria
[8:10:05] Broomba: @towelliee have you seen season 3 of Cobra Kai?
[8:10:09] swampt1l: Buff armor we squishy as shit
[8:10:11] foxies_havocing: my veng dh also needs buff, feels so weak
[8:10:16] Phydeaux: 144 floors for the mount
[8:10:18] bionicbeechy: prot in arenas needs nerfing tbf
[8:10:21] Exxcar: man... I hope the upper layers of this are actually a challenge, cause if not... I feel Torghast is just dead now... no challenge at all, and just a grind
[8:10:26] adjamia: Hi

[8:11:03] Grady2385: bro pallys are great on mythics right now bro specially last week

[8:11:08] Phydeaux: Map is in upper right by default
[8:11:11] Anteman752: Unlimited power?
[8:11:13] SethSteckler: @adjamia that's where ElvUI has it by default
[8:11:15] skoobz3: arcane blast**
[8:11:17] Alepouditsa: i hope the make it scale with your ilvl so it will be harder for you ppl that do raid LUL
