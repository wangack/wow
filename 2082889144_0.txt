[1:44:59] theBroHam: @Maximo94 there a wa that tells you who to put AS on that is the most beneficial

[1:46:28] Adrang: that means its working
[1:46:50] wraghelm: Mornin JB
[1:47:15] ChiggyCasts: When you cast AS it adds 3 stacks of it on to someone so you want to try to cast it on ppl with 2 stacks so it goes to max stacks and then can have a bigger split because of the talent

[2:37:38] WingedChipmunk: @bremek0 unless you feel as if you need more healing, I'd say haste/crit haste/verse
[2:39:12] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[2:43:57] Shkafche: convert it to bnet balance and/or buy a bruto ... though 11mil may not be enough for a bruto
[2:44:53] Thowarr: You have to be with BMAH traders to reserve that at gold cap:, 9.999.999, basically the moment it comes up

[2:52:42] WingedChipmunk: @bremek0 healing is definintely needed the higher you go, why mastery is becoming more of a requirement. But like mid 20's you can still get away with crit/verse prio stats
