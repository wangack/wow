[1:38:06] 1_Pace: WoW is not broken. MDI format is broken. Should be a pick/ban scenario similar to OW or MOBAs to prevent people from just straight min/maxing their way to a boring victory. Stacking has always existed in high end PVE content and it's the reason why many people said it wouldn't be interesting to watch. Shake up the MDI format for better games.

[2:38:46] IndianaLance: @Sleepypan, I don't believe that. If you had to pick different DPS classes, I don't think EVERY team would cookie-cutter one build. Someone would take a lock over a mage. Or a hunter over a shaman. Harder to min-max with different DPS classes. Also, team strategies might be different, based on different DPS compositions.
