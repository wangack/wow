[0:08:35] TonyJhee: I would MUCH rather have health bars that take a few people to fill than mechanics that all do 80% of a person's hp
[0:08:36] harris01_: healers will need to step up

[0:09:27] its_blando: or something like that

[0:09:30] PropheticEvent: We haven't recorded enough healer heart attacks during beta. Gotta crank it up

[0:13:53] OrganicJKW: It prevents one-shots, but also means you have to recover 40% more hp to top players.

[0:14:18] TonyJhee: @Lunephaea Disc is the hardest healer to play (in raid) but it sets you up to be proactive across all your healers, so I recommend it to people.
[0:14:19] vaereee: buffing things that were already overkilling you by 40% means one shots will still exist
[0:14:25] TheRealTarrjue: 40% of X damage doesn't equal 40% of Y player health

[0:15:36] profPizzaParty: rdruid stonks going up as only 1.5 minute ramp class
[0:15:38] TonyJhee: Their ramps are going to be INSANE
[0:15:39] TheRealTarrjue: @ketchumer possibly, other factors come into play. also, using the extreme case of a 1 shot isn't good either way
[0:15:42] cloakofmoon: is link totem stronger now?
[0:15:47] Callesoe: @TonyJhee Fair :D Disc is just something else. I have tried all healers ofc. But there is nothing like disc in my opinion

[0:21:15] elerqs: !meta
[0:21:15] Nightbot: I think people are mostly just going to play their raid mains/what they find fun in s4 because its short.  Most healers/tanks can do high keys - and for dps you'll mostly see rogue/fire mage/warlock/surv hunter/ww
[0:21:17] thebdc: MW at range can't really do damage, so why would anyone want to play it like that?
[0:21:18] VivaZebra: I'll only accept BMW's answer
[0:21:26] Lunephaea: Im surprised people don't seem to like resto shaman anymore.. from what i read it was the most powerful healer. I assume that's super dated atm tho

[0:21:42] whitehounds: @Lunephaea super super dated

[0:53:28] TheRealTarrjue: @yumytv i think what people aren't considering is that blizzard obviously needs to tune down shit like ruby life pools and random adds that own players. but if they ONLY do that and nothing else, healing will be too good and boring. it seems like they already have this tuning in raids. So yes, this nerfs healing but its so that it doesn't become stupid boring when they tune down the random spike damage that's problematic.

[1:00:32] Kellin_mcjellin: Simple answer is never having done a +20

[2:00:57] greenesteve: What about what your guy said about some tanks getting relatively buffed by the 40% cause they do healing base on %health vs flat number health

[5:48:27] mareauauscent: @yumytv does a disc priest need a decent group (to avoid avoidable dmg) in order to shine? I always have issues keeping everyone alive even with atonement healing through damage and flash heal
[5:48:30] Theletter8: Theletter8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! 💕
[5:49:06] mareauauscent: I just have so much more trouble with disc than rdruid/rsham
[5:49:42] syhtric: does the rogue stream?
[5:50:01] dorki: it just requires more knowledge of where danger is
[5:50:03] mareauauscent: So just more practice, thanks
[5:50:09] dorki: its a proactive healer rather than reactive
[5:50:19] mareauauscent: I hear that about rdruid too though, but don't really have issues
[5:50:23] syhtric: dang spriest pumpin
[5:50:29] mareauauscent: especially with stuff like convoke and tranq being able to top up after some mistakes
[5:50:33] dorki: well rdruid just has big healing numbers
[5:50:34] unsteddy: I'm just playing all healers rn
[5:50:54] unsteddy: gotta decide on best pug healer haha
[5:51:00] dpb67: dorki chatting about healers HUHH when is growl gonna start talking about prot warrior
[5:51:04] mareauauscent: lmao
[5:51:05] pestyxd: hpal seems to be the sleeper healer
[5:51:11] mareauauscent: I love that dorki's engaging here
[5:51:18] dorki: im a pro unlike yumy
[5:51:25] dpb67: true dorki rdruid is goated
[5:51:45] SaiKyu: rdruid put several heals as being proactive while disc is more applying a buff to be able to heal reactively
[5:51:45] vondahanner: Dorki throwing shade at Yumy
[5:51:56] SaiKyu: So I would say disc is both pro and reactive in tandem
[5:51:57] shmeeso: holyyy I can't wait until dorki does WF +28 ruby life pools when growl is afk for a week
[5:51:59] pestyxd: true, im hoping blessings of seasons can curve that balace a bit but i dont mind doing less dmg aslong as its fun
