[2:51:38] guildzy: try it
[2:51:42] alextgay: go 1440p
[2:51:44] DiscoBallx: its better yes
[2:51:44] TheRealD4rk0: is the twitch limit not 1080p?
[2:51:52] sotamasiina: this girl sounds like m0istcritical
[2:51:56] flashnickgg: click it and pump up bitrate shroudRage
[2:52:00] carlstpierre: it is sharp as heck
[2:52:00] shepardprime: I have a 2k monitor and yours still looks better
[2:52:01] shortyy445: shortyy445 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[2:52:01] HandoEZ: Isn’t it no better because of the shitty bitrate limit Twitch has?
[2:52:04] ton_618_chan: Not that much better
[2:52:06] lolcakey: Game is the same but his UI stuff is crisper.
[2:52:07] XDrahc: looks the same to me
[2:52:08] 2caves: what's twitch's max bitrate at this point?
[2:52:10] iHemoZ_: Wadu i miss you
[2:52:16] Maxe_OG: @shroud yeah but you will need another setup for you UI if you switch to 1440p from 1080 .. same if you go down to 720p
[2:52:17] Sifercifer: whats the bitrate cap on twitch?
[2:52:22] Snaps725: pro streamer LUL
[2:52:25] i_am_realfake: Finally good music @shroud
[2:52:27] HandoEZ: $$$$
[2:52:30] csgomotivation: small indie company
[2:52:32] Realist4ever: Twitch needs to implement AV1
[2:52:32] Nebulae3: 1440p looks great
[2:52:59] Sifercifer: that name felfiremommy thats great
[2:53:03] TheRealD4rk0: twitch needs higher bitrate first and for most
[2:53:05] dcobra22322: @i_am_realfake God i hope you werent talking about the other stream LOL that made me close it immediatly after opening it and checking graphics quality LUL
[2:53:24] Maxe_OG: @shroud If you got text´s and stuff and you go down to i.e. 720 from 1080 .. you will miss some text and need to change your whole setup for it
[2:53:25] AetherMana: I hope he knows that max watches a live feed while he streams. Its someone elses settings thats being streamed
[2:53:38] iibackpackk: liquid aheaddddddd
[2:53:47] RuflessMisfit: it does
[2:53:48] BobbyWobbyWoo: have any of you tried changing the render scale to 98% it's like putting your glasses on everything becomes so sharp
[2:54:44] BobbyWobbyWoo: there's a console command to set it to 99.9 that's even better apparently
[2:55:09] jon_glue: is evoker dps any good?
[2:55:18] Gonzumx: @BobbyWobbyWoo there's a way to set the sharpen filter without reducing render scale
[2:55:19] Khlaro: Why is 160p an option? Holy crap. I can't see anything and my head hurts looking at this. duckKekw
[2:55:42] kurib: @Khlaro_ pc audio mode I guess. who knows
[2:55:59] zyrdack: @Khlaro_ legit
[2:56:01] all_calm: anyone know where I can find that frontal/cleave weakaura?
[2:56:06] Khlaro: Yeah, you ain't watching any gameplay at 160p. duckLUL
[2:56:11] Relyful: @Khlaro_ its so our IT department at work doesnt notice the twitch bandwidth xD
[2:56:13] ForksAhoy: I set things to 160 when I want to have a stream in the background while I'm gaming
[2:56:18] Relyful: you just listen to it
[2:56:24] BobbyWobbyWoo: @gonzumx what is it?
[2:56:29] SerbiaRocker: anyone know what weakaura package shroud uses? those casts look clean
[2:56:49] datbigbangclock: Thinking about playing this game for the first time. What kinda guy should I be? Sword guy, gun guy, etc
[2:56:59] Sharkszooka: as a new player is it a good idea to get the level 60 boost? ive never really played before
[2:57:07] UhhhKingJayy: uhhhkingjayy subscribed with Prime. 
[2:57:08] Bledell: Is that weakaura at the bottom or addon that shows spells ?
[2:57:16] hingerbinger: anyone have the WA for interupt that shroud has
[2:57:24] jon_glue: @datbigbangclock what looks cool to you?
[2:57:27] BobbyWobbyWoo: @sharkszooka not really better to play through and get a feel for the class
[2:57:35] wiosnya: @Khlaro_ To listen to the stream, when you're playing something on 1 monitor I guess. You can do that on youtube, but on twitch it makes sound shit as well iirc  WAYTOODANK
[2:57:42] piQmi: piqmiBounce piqmiBounce piqmiBounce piqmiBounce piqmiBounce piqmiBounce
[2:57:43] ellvo: @Bledell wow show them itself

[2:58:25] Feilprodusert: focus the add here :D
[2:58:33] jrapp106: Is retail WoW back?
[2:58:37] Bledell: @Bledell Wow shows the order of what spell to cast next ?
[2:58:45] Sharkszooka: @wopa_hhg thanks! are the other things in the heroic or epic editions worth it?
[2:58:48] Xpariah: What M+ timer addon is that? Or WeakAura?
[2:58:51] SerbiaRocker: @Bledell think that's hekili
[2:58:51] ForksAhoy: There's been a few CHUNES back to back on here. peepoDJ
[2:58:55] datbigbangclock: @jon_glue idk things are moving too fast to know what’s happening
[2:59:16] SerbiaRocker: @Xpariah that one is warpdeplete
[2:59:26] Maxe_OG: @datbigbangclock If you want to get into groups real quickly, then i would pick a healer, i.e. the priest is pretty good to solo and have some of the biggest heals in groups .. otherwice i would go Paladin, but thats just me .. My Paladin is a legend in Wow .. xD
[2:59:33] datbigbangclock: But I was watching someone do quests and they had a sword and that looked kinda fun
[2:59:37] Xpariah: @SerbiaRocker Thank you very much!
[2:59:37] BobbyWobbyWoo: @sharkszooka I'd say about 8 to 10 first time
[2:59:51] Sharkszooka: as a new player are the epic or heroic editions worth it?
[2:59:52] facewithaname: I dont play wow but these streams are relaxing
[2:59:56] datbigbangclock: So if I’m a priest can I also kill things? Or am I like a medic
[3:00:00] Sharkszooka: @BobbyWobbyWoo ty!
[3:00:16] jayreddragon2: Voice actor for Granyth is ur mum
[3:00:21] recckk_less: Hes credited as "monsters" so possibly
[3:00:23] atotalunit: Can you even get into WoW as a new player? Looks so relaxing
[3:00:38] Maxe_OG: @datbigbangclock yeah you can kill stuff pretty easy while staying alive with heals
[3:00:40] BobbyWobbyWoo: @sharkszooka I'd say the worth of the editions is purely personal
[3:00:54] SerbiaRocker: you can always upgrade editions
[3:01:03] SerbiaRocker: basic one is enough to start playing
[3:01:04] SaadySnipeS: i just got into it and its not bad so far i got a fury warrior build going

[3:05:45] MCSwagdooodle: For horde, I think trolls or blood elf are decent priests
[3:05:56] Exrny: @shroud think you have to change it in WA's and not in the plater addon since it's the way they made it in Atrocity UI

[3:06:11] mattheussreis: !plater

[3:36:56] itsquetzy: @legofortnite11 dont think it got buffed, i read this on a raid tier list post, its only up there because of its utility in innervate, stampeding roar, etc. but its dmg really isnt that good

[3:42:20] astrofroze: Hey Shroud! Are you paying attention to the RWF?
[3:42:24] insaniity: thing is that mmo's were mainstream, now people are not as interested compared to other genres. Maybe they can do it with their universe and massive fan base @blissfulparanoia

[3:43:50] source__2: @shroud What add-ons are the best for a new WoW player, this weakauras stuff is so confusing
[3:43:51] itsquetzy: quads is the best you get 4 tries for every player in the squad
[3:43:55] bydand87: it is for the first time in years
[3:43:55] Earthapples: whats shrouds ilvl?
[3:43:58] itsquetzy: 1 for every player
[3:44:04] chun: i gotta stop playing wow
[3:44:22] blissfulparanoia: @insaniity perhaps, but the number of people who are willing to buy a game for 40$ + pay 15 a month will be minuscule compared to the playerbase a F2P MMO will get assuming its from a known, large and importantly TRUSTED developer
[3:44:27] BobbyWobbyWoo: @bcq4 yeah but I think it's just not as instinctively clear as other games that are big in live streaming
[3:44:37] astrofroze: @Java_Digital Bartender4 for very simple UI customization. Then you can find a set of WAs for your class spec as a good starting point.

[4:01:04] DGTLtv: @1TheRealCrayZ 15$ a month + expac for 50$ i believe
[4:01:10] BobbyWobbyWoo: @profanc untrue Legion was top tier
[4:01:19] Earthapples: @1TheRealCrayZ you can look the prices at the website, but if you make enough money ingame you can buy with ingame gold a monthly subscription. Right now i think it's about 280K gold for one month play time

[6:53:12] Chill456: @thygrief I think he's just main tanking right now. I honestly dont watch shroud play wow much. I think they're pretty casual raiding
[6:53:29] joni_3000_: Any twitch staff? My account is locked by verfication code and support only give auto reponse
[6:53:52] boran2209: @Bakardee No, weakauras are just to see your important spell in a single glance
[6:54:01] boran2209: *spells
[6:54:09] kheim: wait hes following hekili to a tee
[6:54:37] boran2209: Rotaion of buttons and skills are completelty player skill based
[6:55:08] jakehutz: Hekili isn't used by skilled players, it's a helper addon for those who do not know the rotation of the class well
[6:55:25] Bakardee: @boran2209 i mean that is literally giving him prio.
[6:55:28] MCSwagdooodle: gogo
[6:55:37] Bakardee: it's fine, i just thought it was a weakaura
[6:55:51] MalakiDaSimp: how is melee even hittin it that far away
[6:55:53] kokal9: that is hekili and yes
[6:56:01] kokal9: that does what u think it does ,its a rotation addon
[6:56:29] alex_arouet: 🪦
[6:56:33] KhimeLord: Yeha you do
[6:56:35] tossmysaladtf: messssssuuuiiiii
[6:56:45] KhimeLord: you 100% lust there
[6:56:49] Rejoiner: 100% lust last phase
[6:56:50] boran2209: What's heikli?
[6:56:50] MCSwagdooodle: the comms were very nice
[6:56:52] LukeWarmSoups: for the heals, lust is a move.
[6:56:58] Ulty___: what do you think of this video rendering tool
[6:57:00] jakehutz: @boran2209 rotation helper addon
[6:57:07] LukeWarmSoups: idk why hes not seeing that
[6:57:11] Ulty___: epiiiccccc
[6:57:11] mormo175: almost every guild is lusting last phase
[6:57:12] dritotv: lust when hes on the platform
[6:57:13] Rejoiner: lusting start is legit useless
[6:57:30] Dyasis: you use lust on the last platform 100%
[6:57:31] dbgzx: that is wrong
[6:57:33] KhimeLord: not true
[6:57:37] LukeWarmSoups: everyone forgets lust is a Defensive cooldown
[6:57:37] hedgebod: damn
[6:57:38] KhimeLord: hes wrong
[6:57:40] boran2209: You lust on pull
[6:57:41] Honeycrispie: hes wrong but doesn't wanna admit it xd
[6:57:42] matching_towels: I get both points
[6:57:44] TheSHAYdynasty: lust pull
[6:57:46] LukeWarmSoups: hes hard wrong
[6:57:48] boran2209: And pump damage
[6:57:52] beckinsalex: tension in the raid
[6:57:53] Lifeclown: Lusting last phase is actually useless, it's awful for loads of classes to DPS there
[6:57:56] Caz1_: Take your pick. Raids do both, beginning and end. Its all about your comp
[6:57:58] Rejoiner: its not dps race at the start, last phase is only hard part
[6:58:03] CrookBaron: can anyone tell me the mealstom addon he uses ?
[6:58:08] lycen1: just try it
[6:58:09] d1ge: lusting start is 500iq
[6:58:10] beckinsalex: jacob needs to raid lead
[6:58:17] chef_means_chief: but you have everyone alive at the beginning
[6:58:18] Austenoki: u already have the sim addon on ur mini map bottom left
[6:58:18] Ulty___: no need to top the top of the top if I am building a top less toping
[6:58:23] chausseee: try both why not
[6:58:25] CrimsonCringe33: ackshually im correct Nerdge
[6:58:32] Caz1_: Hes got a good point
[6:58:43] dritotv: if its not % based hes right then
[6:58:44] Dyasis: ....
[6:58:48] LukeWarmSoups: lust is 100% a healing cooldown
[6:58:53] LukeWarmSoups: absolutely
[6:58:55] hedgebod: @CrookBaron it's a weakaura
[6:58:58] Rejoiner: not a healing cooldown wut LULW
[6:59:00] Dyasis: sorry, this guy is not correct at all
[6:59:01] CrookBaron: @hedgebod ty
[6:59:01] Spirzj0r: wich UI is this?
[6:59:02] Honeycrispie: lust the last platform
[6:59:02] dbgzx: lust is definitely utilized as a healing/damage cd
[6:59:03] drekiow: isnt lust an everything cooldown
[6:59:11] MCSwagdooodle: even healers can DPS at the beginning aswell
[6:59:13] restubruv: can you ask him to just try it
[6:59:14] Ulty___: you need a few of those LLEEERRROOOOYYYY JEEEENNKKINNNNSSS mentality players :D
[6:59:16] Vrocas: @shroud Lust on pull will make the last phase shorter so it's infinitely better
[6:59:19] verosityy: @LukeWarmSoups you right
[6:59:23] CrimsonCringe33: has this guy ever raided before? KEKW
[6:59:26] ukioko: Doesnt hurt to try
[6:59:29] Jrbgarcia14: not enough rogues lol no wonder
[6:59:29] itsKahGeh: @drekiow absolutely it is an everything cooldown, i dunno wtf is with this guy's take
[6:59:29] Rejoiner: lust gives faster globals and casts so ofc it gives a lot of more heals????
[6:59:29] boran2209: Lust on pull, for sure
[6:59:31] KeydriTV: As Liquid was using lust as a healing CD last phase of 7th boss lol
[6:59:33] TheSHAYdynasty: patrick i believe in you
[6:59:35] Spirzj0r: !ui
[6:59:35] StreamElements: @Spirzj0r, he's using ElvUI: https://bit.ly/shroudElvUI
[6:59:39] MCSwagdooodle: LOL
[6:59:41] LukeWarmSoups: you cant dps if youre dead
[6:59:41] boran2209: Casters have a hard time in last phase
[6:59:48] boran2209: Lust on pull no matter what
[6:59:51] CrimsonCringe33: dude watched 1 youtube video and is sticking with it
[6:59:59] Ecast201: just look and see where dps is at to start without lust
[7:00:03] Coleman_CS: @shroud what addon you use for raid frames?
[7:00:05] verosityy: Lust on pull
[7:00:08] boran2209: Everything is gucci now on pull, so pump the boss
[7:00:09] MalakiDaSimp: is this game possible to play solo

[7:22:57] Zephyr9215: I gotta say, watching WoW raiding compared to FF14 raiding is a very different experience.

[7:23:19] hedgebod: @revora_ that's not the point, jesus christ... if someone is fucking up, you say what should be done, dont go calling someone stupid or something

[7:46:02] Caz1_: they wiped at 2%. they got this
[7:46:07] Remain62: you have to lust at the end
[7:46:09] Trashymath: tbf i dont get how last phase is a better BL

[7:48:29] kokal9: 125k per
[7:48:29] Morgoul_: lusting not on pull requires people to time their cds correctly and ramp into lusts/hold
[7:48:31] Honeycrispie: @Jackfwaust why we always gotta meet like this? 👋
[7:48:34] Caz1_: yeah its busted cuz they heal for like 50% when healthstones are like 25%
