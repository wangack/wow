[6:02:15] snake_like: I have all 99's except two 98's on my lock and my group is about to shift PI's to our mage next few raids moon2PAIN . also parsing as lock is just getting more crits on incinerate on a short fight
[6:02:40] AcheronV: Needs to just highlight a box yellow on logs if you get simped for at all vs baseline logs
[6:02:47] iknowido: 99 parse but 3200 rank is kinda trash
[6:02:48] Andiells: change details
[6:02:51] AcheronV: easy ranking split
[6:03:29] NutterCircus: Gotta love the new Strats that are just ridiculous
[6:03:40] fart_boiii: im dying
[6:03:49] snake_like: low rank but high parse just means you smashed the raid early. nothing wrong with that.

[6:07:55] zillazay137: if they arent significant whynot roll them
[6:07:56] CasualCooky: So even at 50s the raid leader gets a free 5G maybe more just cause they are a greedy cunt?
[6:07:58] snake_like: jfc classic players will bitch at the most inane inconvenience
[6:08:03] boopbopbamski: how come you didnt bring world buffs to this raid?

[6:09:03] CasualCooky: you get like 20 drop a raid we get more than that most times so 20 x 50s = 10G
[6:09:13] boopbopbamski: @johnnyhopkinwead1 waduuu heck brother no
[6:09:16] wavecadet: @johnnyhopkinwead1 eh it adds depth/risk to them but it does grief parsing

[6:10:05] boopbopbamski: @johnnyhopkinwead1 true it does feel bad when you die but I think thats what makes them so much fun gives you a real reason to not die and try hard to keep them
