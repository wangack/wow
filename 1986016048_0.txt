[0:45:51] procyon_mfc: if not the goblin camp then u may have to to LM
[0:45:54] Anthy1887: @LionheartWorthy only the use of software to support it
[0:45:54] ArchFlames: theres automation in sending 1 input to multiple boxes. thats not the point.
[0:46:00] dj_mafia: apparently not lol

[0:46:29] Brainmanager: @LionheartWorthy no they banned the programs that made you control several accounts with 1 keystroke

[0:46:41] LionheartWorthy: I didn't know that part
[0:46:43] kokochris: You can do it, as per blizzard article on multi boxing; only if you automate it: https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/24258#:~:text=Multiboxing%2C%20or%20playing%20multiple%20World,our%20End%20User%20License%20Agreement.
[0:46:45] Ellie_Stark_: there are always people who multibox and use loopholes in the rules of blizzard to automate still. On retail you would see groups of 10 druids all harvest resources at the same time. Always the god damn druids
[0:46:47] Uglyfoot: They didn't ban but they effectively killed it do to banning the program that made it possible.
[0:46:48] meh_ninja_please: FatHalpert the pack is back PogU i thought theyd get blown out by the lions

[0:47:03] Cruduxy: Ellie_Stark_ danO yeah and they pretend there is none of that
[0:47:06] Anthy1887: you can just alt+tab and set your characters to follow. tedious but allowed. :D
[0:47:06] CatDad__: they got rid of multi-boxing - but still allow botting to thrive lol
[0:47:09] kokochris: just dont automate, thats all
[0:47:10] Brainmanager: @Ellie_Stark_ no it isnt since blizzard clearly state that multiboxing is allowed
[0:47:14] FatHalpert: meh_ninja_please felt good to beat them, already sick of hearing about the lions lol
[0:47:14] Toon11: yep
[0:47:16] orange_bean: using a multisend is not the same as having 4 windows open and using alt tab LuL

[0:48:20] Cruduxy: Ellie_Stark_ actually worse on pvp servers LUL because they'll kill any solo player they meet
[0:48:22] CatDad__: @kokochris botting is all over HC and Classic Wrath
[0:48:29] sithius75: @LionheartWorthy more expensive too
[0:48:32] arithmetech: Sounds like multiboxing is a little like having Jack and Coke with your breakfast.  Like maybe you're in a little to deep
[0:48:33] Ellie_Stark_: @Brainmanager they happen. They always happen. danSad Same as moonkin druids control sections of maps moonfire spamming zones farming mobs for gold
[0:48:50] Brainmanager: @Ellie_Stark_ so i am botting?
[0:48:50] kokochris: @CatDad__ botting is not allowed; its bannable. multiboxing is not bannable if no automation.  its in their support rules clearly defined.

[1:04:57] Wild_Iris: will SoD be a separate tab to download at launch or an update to Classic Era?
[1:05:01] doctor_mav: Paladin buffs are way more convenient too. I just use them and that's it. Totems need constant management

[1:15:46] valh411a: the bear trampoline quest KEKW
[1:15:53] Still_Clean: cata was fun but not worth sacrificing the original world forever just for a one-time gimmick

Eventually the other mobs will reset and you can pull out your pet and attack the mob

[4:13:41] Mord_Vi: but one of them allowed registration and it did
[4:13:49] AlisaeRae: @winsseli Oh, yeah it does. I guess a difference also is that taking money off a credit card can cost you money as opposed to a bank costing nothing when withdrawing (depending on your package)

[4:18:38] NyllahSCQ: @FluorescentPickle With so many scammers out, it's better to use a credit card than a debit card. But, you should still treat your credit card like your debit card. Spend within your means.
[4:18:39] GoodGat: its pretty much wow rest of november? any plans on next playthrough?
[4:18:44] DarKrow_: Setup automatic payments
[4:18:44] madmage253: @FluorescentPickle nothing wrong with that approach, I did it for years.  I have good $$$ control and when I realized I wasting a few hundo in free money, I switched over.  Also CC give greater tools when comprimised

[4:19:31] FluorescentPickle: @Mord_Vi debit dosn't mean you can't "get in debt" or have a credit... it just means what you have is what you get. you pay immidetly.
[4:19:38] Mord_Vi: @AlisaeRae in todays society, realistically, we all do

[4:21:49] winsseli: @Mord_Vi loans no, interest rates maybe
[4:21:55] your_dad_in_a_dress: sammich
[4:21:55] Corvin_Tom: the whole credit card culture in usa is little strange to me. spend the money you dont even have
[4:22:08] Mybash_: That is what I do :p
[4:22:09] SabreClass: danChat
[4:22:10] Mord_Vi: @GoodGat thats why you pay what you spent, on time.
[4:22:12] AlisaeRae: @Corvin_Tom It's capitalism, other countries have it too
[4:22:17] mb9023_: you spend credit and just pay off the credit, you don't have to spend money you don't have
[4:22:18] FatHalpert: Corvin_Tom literally the opposite of what dan just said lol
[4:22:33] DarKrow_: I see people spend all of their credit on their card when they get it. BAD idea
[4:22:53] givemecurseupdate: $5-10
[4:22:53] Sam_Nash: What Dan is saying is true. I did what he's saying and my score is maxed out now
[4:22:55] Mord_Vi: 5% back on my Citi

[4:23:10] AlisaeRae: Plus you get a higher credit score
[4:23:11] FluorescentPickle: you npay for the card tho...
[4:23:12] Mybash_: LUL
[4:23:17] Mybash_: Corpa
[4:23:21] AlisaeRae: @FluorescentPickle You also pay for a bank account
[4:23:22] mb9023_: you don't pay for most cards they're free
[4:23:24] RaptureRiot: theere are free credit cards
[4:23:25] Mord_Vi: yup, plus the credit buru sees it and you get a few points in your credit score
[4:23:27] winsseli: sounds kinda crypto
[4:23:28] DonReiniero: Here we dont really do creditcards danHmm
[4:23:29] belgarioneld: the trick is always pay credit in full every month @dansgaming
[4:23:29] LRonHoover: not visa, amex you pay for
[4:23:29] mb9023_: you don't pay for a bank account either lol
[4:23:31] alalonso89: some places charge a % for using a credit card
[4:23:31] Anterak: Unfortunately the world's economy runs on people not being fully in control of their credit. There's not enough education about that in schools.
[4:23:34] Clemency_: Never get a card with an annual fee
[4:23:39] FluorescentPickle: @AlisaeRae I don't cohhSip
[4:23:42] DarKrow_: Paying for the card is rare, depending on what card you choose.
[4:23:43] Mybash_: Yea most of the cards have fees
[4:23:44] shatteredsaint: does not apply to most countries outside US
[4:23:54] Fusemann: the only cards i have are pokemon cards
[4:23:57] givemecurseupdate: @Mybash_ No they don't
[4:24:03] FatHalpert: Mybash_ lol no they dont
[4:24:03] DarKrow_: At the end of the day, just do your research
[4:24:05] WabbitHatter: you have to pay 1-2% extra every time you pay with a debit card? ive never heard of that in EU
[4:24:10] Mybash_: ?
[4:24:16] AgentSmart702: danYes
[4:24:17] SwedishfishTV: A lot of people do that with buying gas and groceries .. smaller payments that add up during a month that people know they'll pay back right awya
[4:24:18] AlisaeRae: @FluorescentPickle Is your bank a physical bank or one of those that has a thing on their site saying "this is not a bank, we are covered by the FDIC etc etc"
[4:24:21] FatHalpert: Mybash_ most credit cards have no yearly fees
[4:24:27] Zunahme: Just just be poor or get sick, chat
[4:24:29] andaroo: @WabbitHatter usually that's the fee from the VISA to the company selling you goods
[4:24:30] madmage253: doing what @DansGaming is describing, that 1-2%, I Have $700+ earned in free money.
[4:24:34] Corvin_Tom: what I see is people in debt just buy ps5 and all kinds of sht instead of taking care of the debt
[4:24:34] Cakedonut: I used my credit card to buy those new pokimane cookies danKappa
[4:24:36] givemecurseupdate: @Mybash_ The ONLY time most cards charge a fee is if you do not pay the card off in full each month
[4:24:37] Zimmy99: Here in the netherlands you pay a fee for the card danNodders  you can get one that is linked to you bank account too
[4:24:38] DocCockter: in EU debit cards dont add additional fees and credit cards are costlier to use than debit
[4:24:45] BERTINI__: dont spend what you dont have - solid life advice ;)
[4:24:51] LRonHoover: usually store has to pay a % fee to visa, not consumer
[4:24:56] jackalo34: Hi dan n chat danHi
[4:24:57] SaltPacket__: My current account already has cashback, but credit card extra security is nice
[4:25:03] AlisaeRae: @Corvin_Tom That's cause those people have no self control, they would get in debt without a credit card too so it's not a good idea for them to have one
[4:25:03] Mybash_: Yea I am from EU and use my debit card
[4:25:07] DarKrow_: @AlisaeRae HATE virtual banks.
[4:25:09] RushingHook: @jackalo34 danHi
[4:25:13] FluorescentPickle: @AlisaeRae it's a bank. just a "only online" bank. a child bank of a bigger one.
[4:25:17] AlisaeRae: @DarKrow_ Same KEKW They're shady
[4:25:19] Mord_Vi: @DocCockter that used to be the case here, in the states, now debit see's the same extra fees as CC's do
[4:25:20] WabbitHatter: @andaroo so does it show the fee when you´re purchasing something?
[4:25:26] jackalo34: I'm hungry. Prolly gonna heat up leftovers danDrool
[4:25:29] StaleSavage: sammich
[4:25:30] foreodessa: NomNom
[4:25:34] andaroo: @WabbitHatter no, I used to manage these fees in my Finance role
[4:25:39] AlisaeRae: @FluorescentPickle Oh, I avoid those but it's good to hear it works for you danHappy
[4:25:44] DarKrow_: @AlisaeRae I find that most contract jobs love to give you virtual bank cards to load your paycheck into. Very lame
[4:25:48] Mybash_: Yup
[4:26:02] FluorescentPickle: @AlisaeRae been going for  years now.. works like a charm
[4:26:02] Torse9: Yup
[4:26:03] andaroo: My debit card is tied to my bank, and I have had issues with that before, so I use the Credit Card as a stopgap, it's easier dealing with fraud
[4:26:11] AlisaeRae: @DarKrow_ Yeah idk what's with that, do they make more money from that or something?
[4:26:17] Ageris: Financial hour with Dan
[4:26:18] Mord_Vi: well these days - using debit or CC at say, a convenience store - the store usually adds a 'fee' to your charge
[4:26:19] jackalo34: Ye I use my credit card that way
[4:26:19] AlisaeRae: @FluorescentPickle HYPERS
[4:26:20] murrsu: Dan the financial advisor!
[4:26:32] shatteredsaint: processing fees mastercard/visa charge the companies
[4:26:41] Corvin_Tom: get educated chat (incuding me)
[4:26:47] DarKrow_: @AlisaeRae I do not know, but I think it is a poor way of keeping your money. I prefer direct deposit to my bank
[4:26:55] BossaSuperNova: DansFinance danNotes
[4:26:56] Mord_Vi: yes, mastercard, visa, they take like 7 cents a dollar
[4:27:01] Beinskrangel: Beinskrangel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[4:27:01] AlisaeRae: @DarKrow_ It definitely is, they have all sorts of extra issues
[4:27:12] RagingPunk: will you play a hunter again for sod?
[4:27:12] Martisan_92: 'Murica sounds more complicated than EU danNo
[4:27:22] DarKrow_: @AlisaeRae Worst part is calling those virtual banks for questions when you have issues. I hated it
[4:27:28] murrsu: Can I pay myself and make infinite money?
[4:27:28] Mord_Vi: so to offset those expenses some stores for lower amounts charge the consumer a 'convienence fee'
[4:27:33] SavageNoble: @andaroo Exactly, same here. I had my credit card number stolen once and someone charged $9000 of rental car fees to it. With credit, I disputed the charges, reported the card stolen, and that was that. With debit... my bank account would have been waaaay overdrawn and my money vanished
[4:27:34] givemecurseupdate: @Mord_Vi I believe that's based on the transaction amount
[4:27:37] Rensaru: if anything, always make sure you make the minimum payment due and never be late, this will at least build a history for good credit
[4:27:39] madmage253: As mentioned before, CC offer more consumer protection if compromised. With DB you're more on your own.
[4:27:50] Corvin_Tom: you what suck? that they don't teach you this in school...how to handle money..instead you cut open frogs and shit
[4:27:52] Mord_Vi: @givemecurseupdate true, in some cases, you have to spend over like 20 bucks
[4:27:55] Mord_Vi: then, no fee
[4:28:00] DarKrow_: @Corvin_Tom KEKW
[4:28:04] AlisaeRae: @DarKrow_ +_+
[4:28:05] Xarhyllac: exactly
[4:28:11] andaroo: @SavageNoble yeah - someone broke into my bank account, i didn't lose anythign but the headahce of having to switch all my accounts and dealing with companies switching my stuff - it just is a headache
[4:28:14] Mybash_: danNodders
[4:28:19] Salladex: they teach useless stuff
[4:28:21] SabreClass: I was thinking that, they just expect you to trip and learn
[4:28:21] Mord_Vi: which is stupid, it's why Americans have so much trouble with credit
[4:28:23] Mybash_: Tax class
[4:28:24] paperthinman: they should teach taxes in school
[4:28:26] SavageNoble: @andaroo Yeah very painful
[4:28:28] Mybash_: :p
[4:28:29] Toon11: lots of schools don't teach evolution, so....
[4:28:30] authorized411: used to be called home economics
[4:28:30] Mord_Vi: no economics courses are mandatory
[4:28:30] LRonHoover: danNodders especially finance, so many ppl are clueless
[4:28:32] RapttorX: danKEK3 school teaching useful stuff
[4:28:33] Corvin_Tom: or how send a physical letter
[4:28:34] FluorescentPickle: "Corporate America 101: banks" :P
[4:28:37] big80s: ive been saying that for decades. there needs to be "LIFE" class
[4:28:37] DarkBlueManta: I remember Dan once buying Hearthstone packs until his card declined danKEK2
[4:28:37] Optimisprimerib: they dont want to teach you finance because then the banks cant make interest on credit cards and loans KEKW
[4:28:44] Mord_Vi: ^
[4:28:44] Dino_Zoomies: home economics class taught me to keep shelve doors closed :)
[4:28:47] remoburton: Same with trig for me
[4:28:50] AlisaeRae: My economics teacher yelled at me and expelled me for saying credit cards work if you have self control KEKW
[4:28:52] WabbitHatter: ok well im googling this now and yeah i gotta say ive never heard of the cashback system. interesting.
[4:28:53] Mybash_: I never seen some body buy 100 melons
[4:28:54] givemecurseupdate: @DansGaming When I got my mortgage, I felt like I needed a school to understand all of the danged parts. I was like "WTF is escrow?!" "What does it mean no chain" danKEK2
[4:28:54] mb9023_: my brother didn't get a cc until he was 23 so he has no credit for car loans etc
[4:28:55] craaazytrain: Same NODDERS
[4:28:56] andaroo: @SavageNoble my car and my house comes right from bank and just dealing with the mortgage company was insane

[4:29:01] A_L_1_C_E: Alan Wake wheel equation
[4:29:02] Mord_Vi: remember that
[4:29:06] HuitNids: you don't use the Pythagorean theorem daily ?
[4:29:07] RushingHook: Home Ec and Civics
[4:29:08] madmage253: @DansGaming you mean you don't calculate the area under a curve on demand to optimally press keys on the keyboard? Sheesh :)
[4:29:15] Hav3nsblade: trust me, if they put in a personal finance curriculum in school, kids would still not give a shit
[4:29:17] Zunahme: @mord_vi yup
[4:29:20] altie1: We didn't even have home ec here. We just had to rely on our parents to teach us
[4:29:24] AgentSmart702: ..and if you have kids, you should tech them finance stuff... danChad
[4:29:26] Velo22222: and don't throw water on a grease fire

[4:29:38] Anterak: You can get a credit card at 18, but no education about how to use it properly
[4:29:43] FluorescentPickle: like what?
[4:29:48] DarKrow_: I certainly don't use math to do my inventory at work lol
[4:29:49] SavageNoble: @andaroo Yup, I hate dealing with that crap! 🤮
[4:29:56] your_dad_in_a_dress: useful stuff
[4:29:56] SavageNoble: I try not to use Excel.... Ever
[4:29:57] Zimmy99: its more sort of problem solving that you might learn from calculus
[4:29:57] PebblesSZN93: I live in the city, schools don't get funded that well to get home ec classes danSad
[4:29:57] Xarhyllac: Do you use Pi?  Yes when it's sitting in the fridge.
[4:30:03] Mybash_: Nice
[4:30:04] DarKrow_: @SavageNoble Why is that?
[4:30:08] Zunahme: And if you do get an education, you have to go into debt to get it NotLikeThis
[4:30:08] madmage253: @Anterak yup, and worse, they target freshman going in to colleges too.
[4:30:13] Hav3nsblade: also a personal finance class doesnt have enough material to cover a semester of learning. You can learn how to do your own taxes and all that other BS in a week
[4:30:13] andaroo: Excel is my jam
[4:30:13] sh1leshk4: Nowadays I just stare at areas under a curve danB
[4:30:16] SavageNoble: @DarKrow_ We just don't get along
[4:30:17] jackalo34: @zimmy99 yep
[4:30:18] Rensaru: "You need to learn these formulas cause you'll never be able to carry a calculator in your pocket forever." Hah jokes on you teacher
[4:30:19] Sam_Nash: I learned excel in high-school and it's probably one of the most valuable things I've learned
[4:30:21] Mord_Vi: i took computer programming in school as a math elective and they taught us how to code in Turbo Pascal OMEGAROLL
[4:30:24] Eraste: i remember my teachers telling me "You have to learn how to do this because you wont be able to carry a calculator in your pocket" look who's laughing now danKEK2
[4:30:30] Mybash_: danNodders
[4:30:31] your_dad_in_a_dress: it's very predatory
[4:30:39] SabreClass: I remember at uni we have a web dev class and the lecturer wanted us to make the website in just notepad... what
[4:30:40] Alexlistair: @Mord_Vi danKEK
[4:30:41] altie1: My husband is my calculator tbh.
[4:30:45] LRonHoover: danNodders especially in college when your poor and need stuff
[4:30:50] Rensaru: @Eraste I like how we had the same thought at the same time
[4:30:55] mb9023_: you should get one at 18 if you understand how to use it. parents should be teaching that stuff too
[4:30:59] Manyfist: English class beyond basic grammar and stuff a lot of it is redundant
[4:31:00] reebooo: Not mine LULW
[4:31:05] givemecurseupdate: I keep having to tell my CC lender to stop increasing my limit danMad
[4:31:06] Mybash_: You become debt slave
[4:31:08] zlottee: don't spend money you don't have would be a good lesson to teach at 18
[4:31:08] jackalo34: I have 1 cc n it's the only 1 I've ever had.  It's how I upped my credit score along with paying off my car I got after college
[4:31:12] beetlejuice76: god i am so old. in my computer science class we learned to use word for ms dos....
[4:31:17] DonReiniero: REXXAR danPanic
[4:31:20] alalonso89: with great powers comes great responsibility
[4:31:22] andaroo: I think if you drive, a good first credit card is a gas card and a debit card - start from there
[4:31:25] PebblesSZN93: the amazon card with amazon fresh combo the points is glorious
[4:31:30] Eraste: @Rensaru oh haha i totally missed your message danNice nice
[4:31:30] Hav3nsblade: @Manyfist you might need to head back there to learn punctuation danKEK2
[4:31:57] andaroo: Amazon Prime card is amazing - I do like $100/groceries through Amazon Fresh for free on it
[4:31:57] RapttorX: @beetlejuice76 ther's word for msdos ? i new there was a text editor, but not word monkaHmm

[4:32:57] Mybash_: Not any more
[4:32:57] Plyticus: a steers card?
[4:33:05] Atma23: The kid from my HS who went to Harvard cheated off me for typing class, just saying. I practically went to Harvard.
[4:33:06] RapttorX: @andaroo Aware wait MSword is even older than me ?
[4:33:08] altie1: Yea, I type blind, right fingers. I rarely have to check my keyboard for a button

[4:33:21] Hav3nsblade: things like calculus in school arent there to set you up practically. It's there to train your mind. Higher level thinking

[4:35:11] NyllahSCQ: Alternatively, if you don't want the Red card, make sure to use their Target app and join Target Circle. You get lots of coupons and cash back for it.
[4:35:11] Mybash_: Show him who's the boss
[4:35:13] altie1: It's so confusing to pay for something in America. You see the price on a product, you go to check out and it's more than the pricetag. I was in awe at first

[4:36:23] Zunahme: @altie1 the whole system is set up to extract as much wealth as possible from the populace.
[4:36:30] EriSeidr: @altie1 That's due to taxes. Not every state has taxes, but most do.
