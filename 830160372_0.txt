[1:37:57] StreamElements: @cherr5, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.

[2:24:02] StreamElements: @iquerohde2, The reason why shroud streams at 936p is because twitch's bitrate cannot handle 1080p quality. 936p is better overall looking and quality wise than 1080p at the same bitrate.

[3:48:07] lukazo000: r u preparing natria's castle?
[3:48:11] Freon_R134: its just 83 + your spell hit up to 16 = 99 cap
[3:48:19] harleyirish: my set up was stolen last year
[3:48:19] Freon_R134: against a 63 enemy
[3:48:22] Mennarch: also the difference between 98-99 is negligible

[3:49:25] CodyTBC: @shroud ALL mobs in Naxx/AQ have 0 spell resistance. Bosses are level 63 which is 3 levels higher than you so they get "level resistance" +8 for each level ahead of you they are. Which you cannot penetrate.

[3:50:35] lordbarbox: @codytbc bosses have resistance, it's just countered by CoE/CoS for all bosses (except KT). But CoE doesn't reduce nature Resistance.
[3:50:43] PimpPanda_NA: BDO isnt good
[3:50:43] AverageJonas: howdy shroudy rowdy, hows it goin @shroud :D
[3:50:44] MuteReality: Is max hit not preferred for memespec?
[3:50:45] Freon_R134: 1 hit is probably worth like 14-18 spellpower or something like that, not sure on ele sham

[3:51:03] BumpsKater: @i4play75 i get the same you need to minimize the stream click back in and then doiuble tapp to open the chat and then double tap again to close the chat then you have the normal aspect ratio
[3:51:07] CodyTBC: @shroud ALL mobs in Naxx/AQ have 0 spell resistance. Bosses are level 63 which is 3 levels higher than you so they get "level resistance" +8 for each level ahead of you they are. Which you cannot penetrate.
[3:51:08] jook: crit is higher priority for fire mage because of ignite

[4:01:02] Sabbaer666: its funny to me, how i assumed shroud would stop playing classic at first of the "big" wow streamers, but he showed me im wrong! the others are the slackers
[4:01:10] osoi____: Classic is pretty meme difficulty. It‚Äôs harder to get money for consumes, than the actual content.
[4:01:14] Compulsive21: you sound exaclty like the officer thats talking
[4:01:14] xxpops: Loatheb wasnt hard? that used to be one of the harder fights

[4:02:32] osoi____: @king_koooz maybe for boomers lol. LFR nzoth is legit harder than anything in classic LUL
[4:02:39] breecheeselol: thats better than maladath
[4:02:46] bonyato: good stat stick for hunters
[4:02:50] Schniesn: @shroud EleDiscord knows. Every Boss has 24 Resi and you cant go lower. So Spellpen brings you nothing in PvE. There are only 2 Bosses in MC with higher resistance.
[4:02:55] Mitmoc: gressil+iblis is what rogues can hope for
[4:02:55] Schniesn: 1 hit = around 14 Spellpower, 1 crit around 10 Spellpower. So being around 9-12 hit is totally fine to parse. Got some rank 1 parses in p5.
[4:02:57] WavySpiffy: Are you excited for Cyberpunk? @shroud
[4:03:01] Ensaneas: @maxduds not for non-human rogues it's not
[4:03:03] briskrain710: you gotta update your addons lol
[4:03:11] Mennarch: Hungering Cold > Iblis > Maladath for rogues @shroud
[4:03:12] supportingorfeeding: tanks need to get rid of edgies :)
[4:03:12] Fullyt0rqued: Human rogues want iblis
[4:03:16] acornsss: its not a damn hunter weapon
[4:03:16] Venom8X: Hunters can get the claw off of sapph
[4:03:20] Mentalstatemike: just9nK
[4:03:20] xxpops: hunters have that polearm
[4:03:25] xxpops: the polear is sick
[4:03:26] mankork: iblis is godlike for hunters
[4:03:27] knuck90: polearm
[4:03:29] Ensaneas: @Mennarch wrong, unless you're talking about humans
[4:03:31] mankork: were not getting our actual bis kingsfalll
[4:03:33] haydenhatin: Yes hungering cold is good for tanks but most bosses in Naxx require and Shield so it would be a waste of a Hungering cold
[4:03:34] acornsss: those rogues and warriors are nuts they'll never see half the weapons they should be rolling
[4:03:43] Etechh: trash loot dagger had good stats too
[4:03:47] burgerboy: why roll on something that isnt an upgrade
[4:03:48] tikibarsensi: iblis on a hunter smh
[4:03:49] grimreaperhud: 20k channel points. Nothing to do with them!
[4:03:49] burgerboy: LUL
[4:03:54] Mennarch: im not but you do you, you are also realistically not getting THC so
[4:03:56] xzas9: hunter get polearm tho u its so good
[4:03:57] knuck90: unless they aren't melee weaving
[4:04:19] BahaPrisdimee: quick go get rend
[4:04:20] Capigo: i didnt know that adam sandler streamed

[4:04:51] david125006: Probably
[4:04:52] Schniesn: @shroud EleDiscord tested it. Every Boss has 24 Resi and you cant go lower. So Spellpen brings you nothing in PvE. There are only 2 Bosses in MC with higher resistance.
[4:04:57] djecgtv: shroud is cracked in all games xD

[4:05:15] ABCPower321: For alliance iblis
[4:05:16] xxpops: depends
[4:05:17] Sandown: thats for humans
[4:05:18] warondeau: yeah gressil hungering cols is bis
[4:05:20] Salionus: gressil THC is bis for everyone
[4:05:23] supportingorfeeding: grssil iblis isn't that bad for rogues tbh...
[4:05:24] zuberi2002: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp ResidentSleeper
[4:05:24] Dhars: Alliance Human Rogues = Gressil + Iblis is BIS
[4:05:24] brockgym: Wow lets gooooo
[4:05:25] Mitmoc: @shroud yes but thc goes to tanks first
[4:05:26] Ensaneas: for ally ilbis, for horde THC > Mala > Ilbis
[4:05:27] Mennarch: sure, but you are not getting THC realistically as a rogue so @shroud
[4:05:29] sneakynu: im not sure about naxx gear but I know that sometimes dagger offhand simmed the best for dps on meme race fury warriors
[4:05:31] xzas9: they will never get both
[4:05:33] rap7ure_: no idea what is happening on screen just here for shrood voice
[4:05:36] hawhawdecarabaw: yeah, but hooow cracked? Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:05:40] xxpops: idk i always played daggers in vanilla
[4:05:42] breecheeselol: you might not get both and if you had to choose 1 u want gressil for sure
[4:05:43] catwalker420: how many shamans do you want in your raid shroud: yes
[4:05:44] AwokenTarHaar: rogues get wep skill from talents though. they don't NEED the hungering cold

[5:04:41] WKeyAccount: common sense @closeseeker
[5:04:42] ThaBiggD: @shroud You should shackle as many death knights on live side as possible for the duration of the fight. Split tanks, healers, dps equally on both sides. ranged and melee. Use a hunter to pull deathknight to the side for the priest to shackle.
[5:04:59] king_koooz: someone pulled visc early to test something one time and people running in got teleported in front of him
[5:05:07] Dredge__: alt-f4 still on server for up to 40 seconds

[5:07:18] Mentalstatemike: English only as well
[5:07:21] Milesodanglers: The more you can CC through the whole fight on live side means the less that makes it to undead which is very helpful later waves

[5:23:43] StreamElements: Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. When working together as a group, these player characters are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master.
