[1:58:51] REWSTON: My take on Cata beta; I seriously dont see the appeal with it, its the expansion that destroyed the old world and everything that made it special :/ and you can even play it now today in retail

[5:09:28] Elijahss: ST got a raid ID
[5:09:28] Creampuff1112: Mara!
[5:09:35] Arriv003: black rock depths is basically a long, long raid
[5:09:37] glutenrich69: mara and zf
[5:10:04] Arriv003: And LBRS and UBRS were basically raids before
[5:10:17] cosmin284: Nessie
[5:10:52] Arriv003: BRD is my fav. It's a great dungeon crawl
[5:11:26] deputygruff: @Arriv003 i'm hoping for BRD but its looking like datamining is pointing to ST
[5:11:34] Floppydiskbuckwheat: well the ring will drop next time, I’m off to bed goodnight!
[5:12:05] Arriv003: ST is fine as a raid. It's massive inside. No one likes to run ST other than the people who know how to clear it
[5:12:13] jwest592: hii
[5:12:15] zNELLY: Hi, is there any way to farm some easy raw gold as spriest in Wow sod?
[5:12:25] SHammerdD: sunken temple was the big dungeon for all lvl 50 class quests... so it makes sense to be the 50 raid

[5:14:27] Arriv003: @deputygruff it makes sense to have it as a raid, because usually the raid leaders will know how to clear it properly
[5:14:44] JC0830: They what?! Hopefully it didn't mess w\ my intended Prime sub 👀.
[5:14:58] Arriv003: In WoTLK classic, people would bail if the dungeon finder popped them into your ST group
[5:15:07] cosmin284: @JC0830  NOPERS
[5:15:15] deputygruff: @Arriv003 yeah i don't mind much either way, my preference would be urbs or brd but i'm totally okay with ST in a raid environment
[5:15:43] Arriv003: UBRS is a mini-raid in classic, they reduced requirements later on

[5:24:41] MrSpaceGrape: I know some people don't agree but I loved cata
[5:25:37] Scaleless1776: Cata ruined vanilla world
[5:26:41] deputygruff: @MrSpaceGrape i just finished up 8 months on a progressive cata server dude lol. it was fun as hell but i got my cata fill and now i'll probably pass on cata classic. atleast the first few phases of it

[5:28:34] bramses: i feel like sod will stay popular through cata initial hype
[5:28:45] bramses: its just a more well rounded experience
[5:28:48] cosmin284: yes
[5:28:59] MrSpaceGrape: I'm the opposite. I had my fill of SoD. Don't really see the fun in it. But cata has the nostalgia.
[5:29:12] Charles_Winston: @bramses I think they have the Issue with Classic, that the whole game is Spaghetti Coding and its not easy to add new things
[5:29:22] MrSpaceGrape: But I bet SoD will be more popular.
[5:29:25] glutenrich69: imo they need to give us more hp, arena will just be a oneshot fiesta Susge

[5:31:07] bramses: its when code is disorganized at a system level because the devs dont refactor often enough
