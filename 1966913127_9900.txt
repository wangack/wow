[2:45:04] Tartug: ESO does such a good job pumping out content
[2:45:05] narsizze: Who still remebers Dragoon ? :))
[2:45:07] allbb: red bad green good
[2:45:08] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D

[2:45:08] B1kershad: !Build
[2:45:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Danger!!
[2:45:20] B1kershad: !build
[2:45:22] Tartug: @l1tt Not my fav combat system but I still enjoy it
[2:45:24] rolst: pic up
[2:45:24] silviku: monkaGIGA
[2:45:24] Laserbeam_89: @Dev_24 Yeah. I use Isobal Veloise as healer. But isnt leveled as far yet lol
[2:45:26] ElectricChad: New World just needs end game content
[2:45:27] EverythingHaz: Love when shroud plays MMOs he never plays then gives the dumbest opinion😅
[2:45:27] theogbillywink: No tri stat or hp potions??
[2:45:27] Trivarus: ESO Hardcore when
[2:45:29] allbb: heal pot?
[2:45:42] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[2:45:45] AceOfHalo2: LAND BITCH lol
[2:45:45] yake________: @Tartug I mean you are comparing a 9 y/o game to a 2 y/o game
[2:45:48] shuualol: shroud on ESO?!?!?!?!?!
[2:45:48] Nebrise: vykas vibes
[2:45:49] FrozyTV: Trivarus that would be fun, considering how easy the game is
[2:45:50] EgorZein: is this an arena content for 2 players?
[2:45:51] chippychops1: do you still play new world at all?
[2:45:52] Dev_24: @Laserbeam_89 do you play the game a lot? is it playable solo then? even endgame stuff
[2:45:54] B1kershad: !gear
[2:45:54] Fossabot: @B1kershad, MAINGEAR MG-1: shroud Edition - Ultimate | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 | Intel Core i9-13900K | MAINGEAR 360mm AiO RGB Liquid Cooler | RGB Performance Fans | ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Hero Motherboard | 32GB XPG Lancer DDR5 6000MHz Memory (2x16GB) | 2TB Solidigm P44 Pro SSD | 1000W EVGA Power Supply https://maingear.com/shroud
[2:46:05] allbb: @EgorZein solo or duo yeah
[2:46:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Awesome
[2:46:10] denzvic: Is there a way to get all current expansions without buying the base game (I already have it)
[2:46:15] p66top: ItsBoshyTime
[2:46:16] OnlyXevrin: who needs mechs if you can ignore them FeelsDankMan
[2:46:22] Deazun: EEEEE
[2:46:24] B1kershad: What build are you running @shroud
[2:46:26] hats1278: does your bear have a name
[2:46:28] Tartug: @yake________ Of course ESO has been out longer. I'm just saying New World would be awesome with the amount of content ESO has
[2:46:30] hats1278: what about "beary"?
[2:46:32] eqpriest: can you p2w this game?
[2:46:34] EgorZein: @allbb time to comeback to the game :)
[2:46:35] theogbillywink: @denzvic I think there is a deal or I think when you purchase the most recent, it usually comes with the prior ones. check the website
[2:46:39] evilaschild: @denzvic eso + you get to play all expansions besides most recent
[2:46:39] Bcappin3: @denzvic you can buy them in game from the shop
[2:46:45] l1tt: basically a summoner 1 bar build
[2:46:49] l1tt: summoner sorc 1 bar
[2:46:52] Laserbeam_89: @Dev_24 Yeah perfectly playable solo. Normal dungeons can be soloable with a specced out companion and high level cp. :)
[2:46:54] 00RedStar: quinGuGu
[2:47:07] yake________: @Tartug oh for sure yeah
[2:47:09] AssistedSage4: @denzvic You can buy them in the crown store for 3500 crowns EACH, or pay someone gold to buy them for you. Imo, it's VERY worth it to just get all the expansions + base game though. The base game goes on sale for $5 USD all the time, so you wouldn't be "losing" much value
[2:47:23] sazmou: what a gamer
[2:47:33] Deevo_Twitch: this game looks cool
[2:47:33] ysvsh9: dead island Dlc?
[2:47:35] ChaoticViperz_: @denzvic I agree with the other dude eso + gives you a ton
[2:47:38] Deevo_Twitch: is it on steam?
[2:47:49] infuryz: @B1kershad is noob
[2:48:07] Deevo_Twitch: how can i get ESO @shroud  i wanna try it
[2:48:10] Laserbeam_89: @Laserbeam_89 And story content is tailored to solo play. But newer expansions you can do the end bosses there in a group (if everyone is at that part of the quest ofc). Base game story has solo only instances.
[2:48:16] ZlLLA7: @Deevo_Twitch Yes it's on Steam
[2:48:16] PsyNytes: !eso
[2:48:16] Fossabot: Endless Archive content is a brand-new, free feature in The Elder Scrolls Online available to everyone now on PC, and coming to Xbox and Playstation consoles Nov. 14. Hop into the game now to rise the ranks in the Endless Archive leaderboards! #ad https://bit.ly/3QxaMy8
[2:48:22] spiike_spiiegal: your duo is cracked...must play ESO every day
[2:48:24] Deevo_Twitch: bet
[2:48:35] patato99ita: 100 fps LOCK
[2:48:41] denzvic: Thanks everyone
[2:48:47] patato99ita: avoidable with addons
[2:48:49] infuryz: is there a veteran difficulty
[2:48:49] TROJENxxmcDANK: Wait what happened to all your FPS gameplay did you stop CS:GO and Apex Legends and all that other games ?
[2:48:57] Aradalf: @spiike_spiiegal hes the only one online in a guild of 350 so what do you think lol
[2:49:01] kellybrandon: this game is goated
[2:49:01] AssistedSage4: @infuryz No, each "arc" gets more difficult as you go on
[2:49:11] silviku: new boss PauseChamp
[2:49:21] TROJENxxmcDANK: It's so strange seeing you play this instead of your normal stuff I'm used to seeing you famous for
[2:49:26] AssistedSage4: For reference, this is the last boss of the first Arc
[2:49:37] AssistedSage4: so it will get significantly more difficult after this
[2:49:39] therealrayred: Is this game worth picking up
[2:49:41] l1tt: resumm them PepeLaugh
[2:49:41] PsyNytes: This is his normal stuff. MMO's are part of what he plays constantly
[2:49:48] Etheom: is there a certain time of year that crowns go on sale?
[2:49:56] ZOS_Gina_Bruno: @Deevo_Twitch Sending you a DM :)
[2:49:57] AssistedSage4: @therealrayred It goes on sale for $5 USD for the base game all the time :)
[2:49:57] yhcti: @TROJENxxmcDANK Coll story, thanks for sharing. But he's been playing MMOs for years :)
[2:50:02] Greasytoadstool: Games amazing still my favorite mmo to this day
[2:50:04] TROJENxxmcDANK: When she shroud try some ghost of Tabor to VR extraction shooter that's muddled after escape from tarkov
[2:50:14] terra2435: whats that fire orb
[2:50:15] flashnickgg: @PsyNytes mod shroudWave shroudLove
[2:50:15] KnovaPlays: @etheom yes but crown sales are random for the most part
[2:50:17] mrduckytom: @TROJENxxmcDANK and quite frankly you don't watch his streams that often as he was literally playing a fps abt an hour and half ago
[2:50:19] l1tt: orbs?
[2:50:22] ljmacnair: @trojenxxmcdank it’s weird seeing a gamer play video games?
[2:50:23] Etheom: ahh ok
[2:50:24] allbb: i feel like you need tri-stat potions
[2:50:26] PsyNytes: @flashnickgg hiya shroudLove shroudLove shroudLove
[2:50:29] terra2435: orbos
[2:50:31] ChaoticViperz_: @therealrayred when it’s on sale at least for like 5 bucks definitely
[2:50:32] patato99ita: @Greasytoadstool are u ai
[2:50:35] Hurfix: stop damage when it has shield up @shroud
[2:50:37] WorldEIiteSnipeR: You need the bird heal morph
[2:50:39] BigDaz72: @flashnickgg shroudLove shroudWave
[2:50:40] agentmayhem97: look how focused he is
[2:50:45] TROJENxxmcDANK: @mrduckytom I stopped watching shroud when he stopped playing pubg which is quite a long time ago the last time I heard anything about shred was when he had a beard which I honestly I think made him look more distinguished
[2:50:46] hats1278: your dog is useless
[2:50:49] ChumbaWumba6943: so is this basically torghast?
[2:50:49] Greasytoadstool: @patato99ita nope
[2:50:50] hats1278: can you use him as a shield?
[2:50:55] flashnickgg: @BigDaz72 sup shroudWave shroudLove
[2:50:57] kalectwo: WATTT?!?!
[2:50:58] FenStars: Kappa
[2:51:04] DarkusNights: OOOOF
[2:51:16] Trivarus: Maybe its because of the ani canceling but man the combat looks mad clunky, but fast
[2:51:20] allbb: addons would help with the mechanics a lot
[2:51:25] SkullFullghOST: Kappa
[2:51:33] AssistedSage4: @allbb I don't think Code's is updated for this yet though
[2:51:36] TROJENxxmcDANK: But yeah  shourd brother get yourself a VR setup and get back into the FPS scene Miss watching you play pubg Apex Legends and all those other games used to destroy in
[2:51:36] kovi_lol: HUH
[2:51:46] sueythedon: i just started the game now i see shroud stream, nice
[2:51:49] krstbaba: i want to love this game but something prevents me i dont know what it is .. :(
[2:51:50] hats1278: you should send that guy a nasty message so he does better next time
[2:51:55] allbb: @allbb tru
[2:51:55] InsanelyF: @assistedsage4 it is
[2:51:57] LexyyTwitch: LexyyTwitch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[2:52:00] l1tt: @krstbaba Its you.
[2:52:03] mrduckytom: @TROJENxxmcDANK that confirms my comment ;) he still plays them (atm mainly finals he did do some cs2 prior to that
[2:52:07] Aradalf: @hats1278 lol
[2:52:09] yhcti: PEPEGACHAT
[2:52:15] Decimus: @shroud you might want to throw in Vigor instead of the orb on back bar, helps a lot here
[2:52:16] patato99ita: ADDONS LET U UNLOCK FPS AND ALL KIND OF SHIT
[2:52:19] hats1278: @Aradalf thats how things work in gaming
[2:52:21] KnovaPlays: @shroud code combat alerts and crutch alerts
[2:52:22] DarkusNights: there should be a 2023 list of the most used addons or something  XD
[2:52:25] patato99ita: THEY ARE WELL MADE
[2:52:30] Conf1gs: @TROJENxxmcDANK what does vr have to do with pubg and apex lol
[2:52:33] TROJENxxmcDANK: @mrduckytom I must be catching him at the wrong times then try to keep a closer eye on it so I can catch him live on the games I like to watch and play
[2:52:35] hastymxb: AUI and perfect pixel are good
[2:52:47] TROJENxxmcDANK: I think watching him try ghost of Tabor would be interesting
[2:52:47] AssistedSage4: @InsanelyF Huh, my code's isn't giving me alerts in this :/
[2:52:51] foxx_tbe: foxxtbHYPE foxxtbHYPE foxxtbHYPE foxxtbHYPE foxxtbHYPE foxxtbHYPE foxxtbHYPE foxxtbHYPE

[2:52:57] patato99ita: @TROJENxxmcDANK stfu
[2:52:58] krstbaba: @l1tt i dont think its me, like i hated new world and i knew it was me but this game has something else that prevents me from loving it
[2:53:01] TROJENxxmcDANK: I've watched him play escape from tarkov but I don't think I've actually ever seen him play anything in VR
[2:53:10] ljmacnair: @trojenxxmcdank MMORPG and Survival games are better anyway.
[2:53:13] PsyNytes: He's played a fair bit of FPS VR
[2:53:27] TROJENxxmcDANK: @ljmacnair been looking for a good MMO the closest thing I've got to satisfying that need was Star citizen
[2:53:28] Hurfix: yep, it mirrors your dmg back at u @shroud
[2:53:34] Jbreezy_22: anyone play return to moria? on the fence about getting it
[2:53:36] InsanelyF: @assistedsage4 weird, for me it was
[2:53:36] GEOO714: where the fuck i am
[2:53:38] Ghost5392: Guys what type of content would you say endless archive is? Is it like a tower battler?
[2:53:38] AssistedSage4: @krstbaba The combat system is VERY unintuitive to a new player. Once you learn how to utilize it properly, it feels much better
[2:53:40] silviku: FIRST TRY Pog
[2:53:41] Aradalf: nice
[2:53:43] TheRaidiation: TheRaidiation subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! hi

[2:55:35] krstbaba: @AssistedSage4 i have +140 hours and i can assure you im a fast learner, it can be cuz of nightblade being hard to play tho. im not sure
[2:55:36] allbb: lvl 1s have crazy stats
[2:55:39] AssistedSage4: @shroud I can do it on a new level 3 toon
[2:55:49] Jehmini: Shroud on Contractors VR was such a good stream, still remember it from time to time. Contractors VR has come such a long way since then as well.
[2:56:11] silviku: monkaGIGA
[2:56:13] AssistedSage4: @krstbaba I started as a nightblade and HATED IT. Every guide at the time said it was the most beginner friendly. Nope, nuh uh, I hate it to this day LUL
[2:56:13] TROJENxxmcDANK: He should try ghost of Tabor
[2:56:16] hats1278: does this game have any guns?
[2:56:19] TROJENxxmcDANK: He will fall in love with it
[2:56:30] mungus_fungus: bought a $3000 gaming laptop last week :)
[2:56:30] TROJENxxmcDANK: Escape from tarkov in VR man you can't beat that
[2:56:34] Tefornicoo: @hats1278 luckily no
[2:56:34] hats1278: im not buying the tornadoes
[2:56:35] Aradalf: @AssistedSage4 try sorcerer its much more new player friendly
[2:56:35] mesterfokon: What level is he ?
[2:56:43] hats1278: @Tefornicoo unplayable
[2:56:47] TROJENxxmcDANK: Don't brag about that laptops are trashdon't brag about that laptops are trash@mungus_fungus
[2:56:58] TROJENxxmcDANK: I build computers and I will never touch or repair a laptop
[2:57:04] TROJENxxmcDANK: They're a pain in the ass to maintain
[2:57:05] icebornwanderer: Wot game is dis
[2:57:15] TROJENxxmcDANK: For the same price you could have got a desktop that would vastly outperform that laptop
[2:57:19] hats1278: @icebornwanderer my little pony: island magic
[2:57:23] AssistedSage4: @Aradalf I love my sorc! I built a HA pet sorc, and liked the build so much I copied it over to a HA Necro (which doesn't do as much damage, but is much tankier for soloing dungeons n stuff)
[2:57:27] silviku: YEP
[2:57:30] Jehmini: Contractors VR is legit COD Multi/Zombies, Halo, Titanfall 2, Team Fortress 2 in VR the mod potential and selection is insane.
[2:57:31] Hurfix: @shroud You can buy skyshards in crown store so you would be able to get some skillpoints
[2:57:31] RyGuyHollywood: that look at the cam tho lol
[2:57:35] silviku: Arc 2 ramps up like crazy
[2:57:40] Zdub311: What is this they are doing
[2:57:42] Ambonyy: @TROJENxxmcDANK picky arent we?
[2:57:42] mungus_fungus: @TROJENxxmcDANK i lke the button on my laptop, they feel satisfying and i can have a heavy gaming session portable :D
[2:57:46] Trealith: U must take self heal or use Pale Order mythic item @shroud
[2:57:48] Tefornicoo: there is a lot of fanatics on this game, once I meet a cult of guys with rules and a very closed way of playing
[2:57:49] Jehmini: oh and Star Wars Battlefront 2 in VR pretty much
[2:57:49] Nicholas_BigD: @trojenxxmcdank Some people need to be mobile w their setup
[2:57:50] xF4T4Lx34: @trojenxxmcdank and it wouldn’t over heat and have to be plugged in every 2 hours lol
[2:57:54] uniqueCypher: it was a random encounter, its not that hard all the time im arc 2
[2:57:58] ZOS_Gina_Bruno: I see shroud found Arc 2
[2:57:59] Decimus: marauders are tough, especially in later arcs LUL
[2:58:00] J33K77: @shroud Hi, What's your attitude to PoE?
[2:58:09] starzha: mikkaaDance hi chat
[2:58:13] mungus_fungus: @xF4T4Lx34 thats true, it dies in 30 minutes without charger
[2:58:17] J33K77: @Sunszns hi
[2:58:18] TROJENxxmcDANK: @ambonyy pretty much I've had so many laptops myself and I see so many coming to my shop I just refuse to work on them now people don't maintain their stuff and if you've ever opened up a three year old laptop that hasn't been cleaned out oh my God you have no idea
[2:58:24] AssistedSage4: @ZOS_Gina_Bruno I got to Arc 3 solo and... man, y'all made it ROUGH after Arc 2 LUL
[2:58:27] l1tt: I think your #5 heals too?
[2:58:29] n0n0man: does this scale to how many people are in the instance ? So it would be scaled down if he was solo ?$
[2:58:39] Hurfix: @l1tt I think its dmg morph
[2:58:41] ChaoticViperz_: @shroud do you have vigor? It’s a pvp skill tree heal
[2:58:49] TROJENxxmcDANK: Once I had to repair a laptop that had roaches on the inside of it that was the last one never again
[2:58:49] silviku: ye he's got the dmg Tormentor
[2:58:49] starzha: @j33k77 mikkaaEvil
[2:58:56] l1tt: @l1tt no idea tbh i havent played in a while
[2:58:57] aucunepub: @TROJENxxmcDANK How do you clean dust inside a tower ?
[2:58:59] TROJENxxmcDANK: Do yourself a favor and buy a desktop
[2:59:00] uniqueCypher: @shroud yes it was
[2:59:02] xF4T4Lx34: @mungus_fungus not surprised me and my friend use to laptop game all the time and having them permanently plugged in messed up their batteries overtime
[2:59:03] Ambonyy: @TROJENxxmcDANK but more money for you tho
[2:59:03] Decimus: it's rng, and they drop the new class sets
[2:59:05] krstbaba: @AssistedSage4 i just wanted it cuz i loved skyrim as a stealth. i thought that would work similar at least but it really didnt.
[2:59:10] schuldenberater420: SHROUD BatChest
[2:59:15] hats1278: is that floating eye thing single?
[2:59:27] RRiZe: @shroud i like the drip, what motif style
[2:59:31] mungus_fungus: @xF4T4Lx34 uh oh, i plug my laptop in all the time because it dies so fast without it
[2:59:32] RippinBungs: Really wish this game felt better 🥲
[2:59:33] popax1993: What class is he?
[2:59:40] J33K77: @shroud Hi, Do you play PoE? If yes, do you like PoE?
[2:59:43] AssistedSage4: @krstbaba Yeah, my first experience of the game I came in thinking "Skyrim MMO!"... but it is nothing similar, apart from lore and some visual style haha
[2:59:45] B1kershad: @popax1993 pet sorc
[2:59:48] TROJENxxmcDANK: @ambonyy various ways I like to make sure that my fans aren't spinning so I usually stick a stick or something in so they don't spin I use a high-powered air duster and then I go back in by hand with some microfiber cloths and 90 proof isopropyl alcohol and make sure everything is wiped down nice and clean
[2:59:53] aucunepub: Hope The new Elder scrools is not like their new game... i already forgot the name.
[2:59:56] TROJENxxmcDANK: I do this every 3 months with my own PC as well
[3:00:01] starzha: is this not a game to get into as a first timer? mikkaaHide
[3:00:04] TROJENxxmcDANK: The inside of my rig is so clean you could eat off it
[3:00:26] DalouBK: im redownloading this after years of not playing ESO can feel the nostalgia :)
[3:00:34] TROJENxxmcDANK: Isopropyl alcohol is non-electrically conductive so if you accidentally get any on any of your components that won't cause any damage
[3:00:43] schuldenberater420: just lower difficulty for this fight
[3:00:44] AssistedSage4: @Sunszns First timer to elder scrolls, or to MMOs? Because it's my first MMO and I love it. If it's your first Elder Scrolls, that might actually help
[3:00:51] GrimDaKing: 80k i think
[3:00:53] AssistedSage4: I got 72000 score solo
[3:00:54] TROJENxxmcDANK: Never played this game I refuse to play Bethesda game anymore since they jumped me with my canvas bag that ended up being made of cheap plastic
[3:00:54] schuldenberater420: until hes low life

[3:05:35] AssistedSage4: @grillparty1992 it gives you access to all the DLC except the most recent chapter, as well as a bottomless craft bag for your materials while the sub is active

[3:05:42] AssistedSage4: @Tisel all but the latest one

[3:16:15] jaycoms: Not if you fill you skill bar with more class skills then weapon skills. You can get pretty diverse. @hentzgg
[3:16:25] eredrin26: F5 for score
[3:16:29] Punyferret: Gameplay seems fun
[3:16:31] plastikbong: New world looks good
[3:16:35] HayatoF89: if there is way to make that cap higher its 100% crown store item XD
[3:16:35] pkk_ilysuar: Pvp is hella fun if the servers act right 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[3:16:38] HentzGG: @Kreet374 If you fidget and twitch perfectly, its fine. But if you don't you'll get dunked. But the large scale pvp is so funnnn
[3:16:40] Deadroca: @Kreet374  they zerg rush u and u're dead
[3:16:50] cannonwhood88: WHERE HAS BANNANS GONE TO
[3:16:59] HentzGG: @jaycoms Unfortunately most builds revolve around the same skills and builds via weapons
[3:17:16] galactichotsauce: Cyrodill is super fun unless there's scroll trolls
[3:17:16] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[3:17:20] perfecthapiness: there we go cp 468
[3:17:31] evilaschild: @MrRadish just say you're bad at pvp
[3:17:33] flembis: @HentzGG thts just not true LUL
[3:17:34] thesnoopydog: Is that cyr
[3:17:35] stephenizbrown: I love this game. I just hate the load screens
[3:17:37] Tantrix1: This game is super fun, should I give WoW a try is it similar or better chat?
[3:17:40] SkullFullghOST: LUL
[3:17:46] HentzGG: @flembis Its literally true lmao
[3:17:47] pkk_ilysuar: @mrradish that's your opinion to me the pvp is hella fun when the servers act right. Thanks for your 2 cents though
[3:17:50] helpimatree: why we play dis?
[3:17:51] SwaggieD0GG: yeaaaa
[3:17:59] HentzGG: @flembis class identity in this game is very minimal
[3:18:05] evilaschild: LOL
[3:18:07] planet9visuals: good graphics
[3:18:11] lucifer_angelitic: !lurk
[3:18:17] soopaGreg: I hope, one day, they remake the UI ... its ugly and outdated right now
[3:18:24] evilaschild: @PsyNytes idk if that was you this time but man ppl are not in a good place today
[3:18:25] khalil0khalil: shroud play mmo rpg ??
[3:18:33] khalil0khalil: and eso ?
[3:18:36] flembis: @HentzGG its not tho ive played this game for 7+ years, every class besides sorcerer has viable class skills for dmg
[3:18:39] PeterGubin: well he played mmorpgs before
[3:18:41] Punyferret: @HentzGG meaning every class share many aspects in gameplay ?
[3:18:47] tekstyleso: HUH
[3:18:48] SwaggieD0GG: what are you having shroud @shroud
[3:18:53] knuuuunt: bro wtf
[3:18:55] knuuuunt: eat
[3:18:56] ThyKingRich: @shroud  HC wow when??
[3:18:56] knuuuunt: lol
[3:19:05] Alex_NHM: bongoSMASH bring the food
[3:19:06] emilysium_: damn, i haven't played this in years
[3:19:06] SkullFullghOST: Kreygasm
[3:19:07] khalil0khalil: 62 000 personal score
[3:19:07] HayatoF89: @Tantrix1 Wow is outdated compared to this very diffrent combat feeling
[3:19:12] HentzGG: @Punyferret Yes, it tends to blend the classes together and loses identity quickly. Look at WoW classic for example, very strong identity
[3:19:18] fibon06: Is bnans playing ? U need to get a squad and go pvp sometime
[3:19:18] knuuuunt: SOrry havent eaten "Brings bowl of food" "Doesnt eat it"
[3:19:20] jaycoms: @hentzgg  for sure I feel that. But there’s definitely the majority of people running the same stuff. Blobs ESO use to make really wild off meta builds but unfortunately most people succumb to the can’t beat them then join them mentality and fall into the meta.
[3:19:33] khalil0khalil: yes
[3:19:38] khalil0khalil: it's work
[3:19:41] soopaGreg: @HayatoF89 both games is outdated
[3:19:42] wake_rl: how many people can play together in this?
[3:19:43] knuuuunt: LOL
[3:19:46] knuuuunt: ADDICTED
[3:19:57] mixersoldout: @wake_rl 2
[3:20:05] Sunscripts: @HentzGG i'm about to play the game, which class would you recommend?
[3:20:07] HentzGG: @jaycoms Well thats the issue, right? It forces everyone into a meta. The constant tweaking and adding of sets definitely hurts it even more. You finally complete a set and BOOM, new sets with new nerfs
[3:20:08] yoomr_white: Yeah eat a clock work
[3:20:09] knuuuunt: "ONE MORE WAVE MAN" "Scratches neck like chappelle show"
[3:20:13] cem0819: Didnt know you play eso nice
[3:20:14] wake_rl: okay thanks
[3:20:24] JBrown247: @wake_rl 4 in dungeons, 12 or 16 in trials and tons overworld
[3:20:29] BazingaBar: SRHOUD IN ESO? DREAM COME TRUE WTF?!?
[3:20:30] HentzGG: @Sunscripts Any class is fun. My most fun is Sorcerer and Nightblade
[3:20:33] emilysium_: is this roguelike eso?
[3:20:36] silviku: you can do solo with a companion too
[3:20:41] Stitchez_tv: woah torghast looks weird now
[3:20:43] Jihadkrigeren: uwu
[3:20:45] SoberBirch: ESO > The finals?
[3:20:46] Sunscripts: @HentzGG appreciate you boss
[3:20:47] Kreet374: uwu
[3:20:57] EternalArrow: he's eating food on stream, so crueal!!! i'm here starving "-"
[3:20:58] AdmiralPisces: don't even think pressing E without eating that!!
[3:21:01] onggioi: ESO IS DEAD.... How much did bethesda pay for this one lol
[3:21:03] FrozyTV: @shroud if you use Regenerative Ward from your class skills, it will ward your pets and give you minor magicka recovery
[3:21:05] miniverse322: @Sunscripts if firsttimer I'd recommend sorcerer
[3:21:15] iforgotmymeds453: @shroud please donate to gaza so they can eat like u are eating now
[3:21:33] demtrollzZ: @MrRadish Why are you so unbelievably upset that other people like a game that you don't like? Just let people have their fun and play something else
[3:21:36] evilaschild: @Sunscripts ill give this advice with classes, healers are easy, tanks are fun, melee has a rougher time in pve but great in pvp and magic classes are great all around
[3:21:42] JBrown247: @iforgotmymeds453 gaza too busy eating long pig
[3:21:43] BazingaBar: did you try arcanist class??
[3:21:47] knuuuunt: @iforgotmymeds453 Gaza should donate to gaza instead of donating to there politicians pockets.
[3:21:48] MannySJ: #AD LULW
[3:21:50] blurTTV: shroudNom
[3:21:53] Sunscripts: @miniverse322 i'm relatively experienced with mmos, so with that in mind, would you still recommend sorc?
[3:21:54] HayatoF89: @soopaGreg compering to what? i was talking about between Wow and this Wow is more outdated
[3:22:08] khalil0khalil: sry to say that but you guys will lose soon
[3:22:11] Raggamuff: What is up McBoies!
[3:22:16] xxnightkiss: haland?
[3:22:16] Astroflare3: !charm

[3:22:19] pkk_ilysuar: @onggioi eso dead is the funniest shit I've heard. You really need to check your numbers again if you think it's dead. Maybe not top 2 or 3 but definitely not dead
[3:22:22] the_Scooty: I got a message, i earned a drop... but cant find it anywhere. any suggestions? my accounts are paired already...
[3:22:22] etreX: You are not forced into meta builds in this game. Thats just you being lazy and incompetent

[3:22:48] Sunscripts: @evilaschild that narrows things down, i appreciate it. would you say the melee classes make up for the rougher time in pve with anything?
[3:23:03] fibon06: What cp u at shroud?
[3:23:13] evilaschild: @Sunscripts melee is great in pvp, they shine well there
[3:23:17] l1tt: @mt_abd132 Why do you not like ESO? it was pretty fun when i played it.
[3:23:18] soopaGreg: @HayatoF89 wow and eso - both outdated. BUT they both feels very different. Both good and bad.
[3:23:19] 4kPlaysGames: @the_Scooty check your in game mail if you havent already claimed it in drops tab on twitch
[3:23:23] miniverse322: @Sunscripts yeah, its easy and fun, has also builds that are fast to farm. Arcanist would beat it imo but it requires the necrom upgrade, if you don't have that, sorc is a good start
[3:23:25] mt_abd132: @mrradish ????
[3:23:36] pkk_ilysuar: I can log into eso and lunch any content within 10 minutes end of early game any hour of the day

[3:24:13] blurTTV: shroudDab
[3:24:14] evilaschild: @Sunscripts also i said healers are easy but they are also very fun to play, each role feels important
[3:24:14] etreX: Did u finally ban the radish?
[3:24:16] Raggamuff: Okay, it wasnt me..

[3:24:39] HayatoF89: who got banned ?
[3:24:39] Fossabot: @what He's playing The Elder Scrolls Online
[3:24:42] ShinobiSaiZen: does eso require a subscription like WoW??
[3:24:45] l1tt: @mt_abd132 ya i was replying to him, idk why it @ you.
[3:24:48] leakypipe: is he having fun guys?
[3:24:48] the_Scooty: @4kPlaysGames Thanks!
[3:24:51] fibon06: Please tell me your gonna keep playing eso thou
[3:24:53] Loodomanych_BloodTrail: hi PotFriend

[3:25:04] spackle_pirate: LUL
[3:25:05] xhairbait: lol
[3:25:05] Aradalf: @ShinobiSaiZen optional but highly pushed for convenience otherwise lots of inventory management
[3:25:06] pkk_ilysuar: @shinobisaizen no
[3:25:07] mt_abd132: @l1tt not problem
[3:25:10] iSpez: you might need it to block the fire but i couldn't see
[3:25:12] Sunscripts: @evilaschild i don't usually go for healers in mmos, but i'll definitely check out some videos and see how they look. i think i'll go for all classes eventually if i do like the game
[3:25:16] HentzGG: @Sunscripts Arc is pretty fun. I think for a newer player you should do Sorc or Templar
[3:25:18] procccc: @Sunscripts arcanist is strong asf
[3:25:20] ThePointOfNoReturn_: 🌉
[3:25:26] evilaschild: @ShinobiSaiZen the subscription gives you access to all expansions but most recent and the craft bag is super important if you want to keep loot
[3:25:26] eredrin26: They are all weak versions of final bosses
[3:25:28] silviku: 2/3 Crystalline visions PauseChamp
[3:25:34] chiyash_: I love being healing or sniping in mmos
[3:25:44] etreX: You can easily run f2p with addon junkbuster
[3:25:55] Sunscripts: @HentzGG sorc seems to be the way to go for newer players, any particular reason why?
[3:25:55] evilaschild: @Sunscripts for sure, i had 1 of each type when i played consistently
[3:26:12] XxNowIamBecomeDeathXx: @etreX nah. crafting mats take way to much room
[3:26:14] shotsh0t: W
[3:26:22] Sunscripts: @crypto_god good to know, hopefully it's fun too
[3:26:37] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[3:26:40] miniverse322: @Sunscripts it makes the rotation easy - 2 pets passively doing tons of damage
[3:26:41] Sunscripts: @evilaschild seems like the way to go honestly
[3:26:43] SollexGaming: SollexGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hiya Shroudy, hope you're having a good day!
[3:26:56] etreX: No, you store only necessary craft mats and sell the rest. I played f2p junkbuster for a long time

[3:27:05] darkmonarchl: you should be a vampire
[3:27:13] pkk_ilysuar: @xxnowiambecomedeathxx that's why they craft bag aka eso plus is a must of you wanna get fat
[3:27:13] HentzGG: @Sunscripts Doesn't require as many buttons. You can focus on learning to heavy/light attack with a few spells while your pets also do a ton of damage
[3:27:14] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[3:27:16] evilaschild: @Sunscripts sorc is considered the easiest due to its rotation being the easiest to learn out of the dps
[3:27:17] pkk_ilysuar: Far
[3:27:22] palWonderdog: it's very OP so far... lots of fun
[3:27:22] l1tt: really fast

[3:27:32] GrimDaKing: Halloween
[3:27:32] dorz4n: and there is an event with 100% exp buff atm
[3:27:33] xxxnightmarexx69: !networth

[3:28:21] candorthefat: @CHAT best method to lvl now? I just started 2 days ago and am lvl 24
[3:28:29] Sunscripts: @HentzGG @evilaschild ahh i see, the swapping between hotbars does seem a little difficult to get used to. i think i'll go for sorc then, thank you both
[3:28:30] Novellli: @candorthefat BRP
[3:28:39] LucienM: Is it double XP for Halloweem?
[3:28:42] etreX: Best way to level is to enjoy the game
[3:28:43] InnerVisionArt: gw2
[3:28:44] Novellli: @LucienM yes
[3:28:47] vertebra91: i played till vet rank 11 havent played since it went free to play
[3:28:48] Aradalf: @candorthefat highly recommend not leveling fast in this game because youll just be missing the skill points from halloween. recommend just playing and enjoying
[3:28:52] khalil0khalil: gw2
[3:28:53] SP4WN_4G4IN: @xxxnightmarexx69 cant you see iron man in the background bro?
[3:28:54] l1tt: @candorthefat Theres a dungeon you can do if you're really good, and if not, the desert event that everyone does, dolemans or something i forget
[3:28:54] HentzGG: @Sunscripts Enjoy brother. Super overwhelming game at first, its pretty rough in spots.. But its a great game overall!
[3:28:54] RoarinShots: i have 1 thing to say.. oh umbasa
[3:28:55] GrimDaKing: @candorthefat random dungeon and bg once a day helps out a ton
[3:28:59] husej: les do it
[3:29:00] BazingaBar: @LucienM yeah there is witch fastival event now
[3:29:01] leakypipe: login boys, or no?
[3:29:06] evilaschild: @Sunscripts sorc has a bar swap but the bar swapping gets easy to learn, i was against it at first and then i took the time to get it down
[3:29:08] pkk_ilysuar: @candorthefat pop exp scroll and Spam dungeons imo XD
[3:29:09] belfastcl: @candorthefat do your daily bg/dungeon, do the dungeon quest, you need the skill points for passives anyways (so just rushing-grinding is kinda useless)
[3:29:10] pojedzonyy: is this games closest to  WOW in terms of gameplay and mechanics?
[3:29:12] Aradalf: @Aradalf you only get skill points from completing content
[3:29:13] LucienM: @LucienM Thank you EZ
[3:29:14] BazingaBar: @leakypipe do it
[3:29:16] LogzYoshi: This game is basically WOW
[3:29:19] xxxnightmarexx69: @sp4wn_4g4in thats why I asked didn't know if Tony stark lived in that little house with him
[3:29:20] LogzYoshi: But better
[3:29:24] awhbee_: @candorthefat heartland conquerer set training nBrp
[3:29:26] Bjoornwolfr: Shroud, we here at the certified real ones committee have been going around asking for certified real ones to hit the griddy, please, thank you.
[3:29:32] MELT3R: I just wish they would add cross progression
[3:29:34] BazingaBar: @LogzYoshi but better
[3:29:35] Bjoornwolfr: So far we have confimed: Stankrat, Tay, Mely, Chewski, Rallatar, bobberdown, and MsTrash.
[3:29:38] ChaoticViperz_: Well there’s exp gear double exp and exp scrolls so probably pretty fast right now @shroud
[3:29:40] LucienM: @LucienM Champion
[3:29:50] AtypicalXY: says elder scrolls
[3:29:51] LogzYoshi: @bazingabar vudooEZ
[3:30:01] candorthefat: so when you say skill points and such...that is lvling and getting skyshards?
[3:30:03] AtypicalXY: oh, im confuised with Elden Ring
[3:30:03] eredrin26: I think you are the only guy who doesnt do negative contents dude keep staying positive
[3:30:08] InnerVisionArt: what CP  is shroud ?
[3:30:08] Sunscripts: @HentzGG thank you! i've always loved elder scrolls, so i know i'll immediately love the world, the combat looks interesting too. i'd be very surprised if i don't stick around
[3:30:09] TommyPizzavonni: Auooo

[3:30:39] mt_abd132: @logzyoshi and wow is basically warcraft with open world like what are you saying ???
[3:30:43] l1tt: LOL
[3:30:44] Sunscripts: @evilaschild i hope so, it looks a little intimidating. i can especially see it on the harder classes
[3:30:46] evilaschild: @Sunscripts for sure get in there and dive in and you'll pick up all the little nuances as you go along and the community is pretty helpful, you can be in 5 guilds so plenty of help
[3:30:46] ilyxieri: Are we getting the shrowdy rowdy Tomorrow for the ch 1 fortnite
[3:30:55] ArozeScythe: PvE Community in ESO is really nice, PvP is toxic asf lol good luck with that
[3:30:56] galactichotsauce: @bazingabar have you played eso pvp ?
[3:31:01] FamousSpear: this area looks like that stuff from the skyrim dragonbourne expansion
[3:31:08] eqpriest: DO they ever plan to add cross progression from conmsole?
[3:31:09] HayatoF89: @vertebra91 its never been free to play except during events XD you still gotta buy it
[3:31:11] LogzYoshi: @mt_abd132 wow is basically spiderman 2

[3:31:36] mt_abd132: @logzyoshi ok LUL
[3:31:38] silviku: PauseChamp
[3:31:38] Novellli: @Aradalf Yes, but with an added mechanic every time you get back to it
[3:31:39] the1_nephilim: is this a new like maelstrom or vat hollows?
[3:31:45] Beafleaf: Let you cuck?
[3:31:47] Etziee: nah
[3:32:00] XxNowIamBecomeDeathXx: @BazingaBar Bro he just banned someone from pvp in chat lmao
[3:32:06] Inkredibehl_: makes me want to go back to MMOs but i know im easily very addicted to those games.. (
[3:32:08] galactichotsauce: At least this one gives you something to farm for
[3:32:10] GrandTrizzy: decimate them!!! for narniaaaaa

[3:58:42] Chompsy: @OxTear OMEGALUL PEPEGACHAT
[3:58:49] freeeeddarrd: Go to a wayshrine @shroud
[3:58:51] Chompsy: I love that emote
[3:58:51] Raz1872: do / reloadui in chat sometimes that works
[3:58:57] SkyNati: Like a deaeth knight
[3:58:59] rednktaz79: I'm a gamer n I play ESO 24/7 maybe get a few hrs sleep n I'm back on
[3:59:02] l1tt: way out dated
[3:59:06] Aradalf: the way they do it is you do the tutorial and then pick a main area to start your character in @shroud
[3:59:12] ayraprime: cool
[3:59:12] 3PO_SitHappen: I like it
[3:59:13] onhcet1: i think its cool
[3:59:14] 3PO_SitHappen: fresh
[3:59:15] galactichotsauce: Feels like WOW
[3:59:18] Molth0r: you can lvl where you want
[3:59:21] leakypipe: @rednktaz79 ok
[3:59:22] Molth0r: in eso
[3:59:22] noteasys: just grind exp if thats how you want to do it @shroud
[3:59:25] aspzan: I like skyrim but never seen much of this game
[3:59:26] Chompsy: The new intro in ESO where it gives you the option and quick background video of the zone you choose is amazing. I wish WoW would do that with Chromie.
[3:59:27] v0o0o0v: is skyrim worth it
[3:59:30] ronnando27: gives the world more depth
[3:59:32] onhcet1: u can do whatever u want
[3:59:32] Shammir2: the world scales now with your lvl tho
[3:59:33] Karate_moses: it is dated but i do like that ESO scales every area for you
[3:59:34] minizen: it is outdated but what is the other option? @shroud
[3:59:34] Lrg_46: What would the alternative be
[3:59:34] rollstb: just pay someone to level you to 50 in BRP in 30 minutes xd
[3:59:36] Tex1090: you can level wherever you want in this tbh
[3:59:37] onhcet1: theres quests everywhere
[3:59:37] roadrunner822: yea u should spawn in full lvl why even quest
[3:59:40] cyb3rian: the game does not tell you where to go. it will drop you to the newest expansion but fi you would liek to do the missions the way it supposed to be in order you kinda have to google it. The whole idea is that each zone has its story and can be done in any order
[3:59:41] CoffeeAndCream: i truly hate the "everywhere is scaled to you" approach.
[3:59:43] ty_frags: Feels more like work than a video game.
[3:59:46] aspzan: @v0o0o0v imo yes
[3:59:48] the_plain_guy: Hopped in after a while. Why is Shroud playing ESO now?
[3:59:55] ayraprime: oh no
[3:59:55] Vextxt: Do you prefer a wow xp boost thing or?
[3:59:57] Etziee: you have no heals
[3:59:58] NotChronic: no skills too LUL
[3:59:59] JafferFGC: what would you prefer in terms of leveling? any current mmo examples
[4:00:00] aspzan: @v0o0o0v oh wait is that for ESO?
[4:00:05] pkk_ilysuar: It lets you play the whole story in any order you want a true sandbox mmorpg
[4:00:06] ayraprime: no skills no potion KEKW
[4:00:07] l1tt: ur still gonna get smoked
[4:00:11] Chompsy: Well lets see the exp PauseChamp
[4:00:12] galactichotsauce: Level scales players but you'll get wrecked
[4:00:14] 3PO_SitHappen: LUL
[4:00:15] ArozeScythe: @shroud you put CP in?
[4:00:17] Etziee: taunt them to death
[4:00:21] scootndoots: he got this
[4:00:22] Chompsy: If they're like half a lvl per mob then maybe LuL
[4:00:22] RauliePolie: LUL wonder if it works for speed leveling
[4:00:23] 2_77: you picked wrong starting skill :D
[4:00:23] silviku: 88 xp Pog
[4:00:24] Amm0_gg: is this hermaus mora stuff?
[4:00:32] galactichotsauce: This is awful LUL
[4:00:36] Chompsy: OMEGALUL 88 nvm
[4:00:42] richieg6667: !mouse
[4:00:42] Fossabot: @richieg6667 He's using the Logitech G303 Shroud Edition Wireless - With a Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad shroud Edition. Grab one while you can!
[4:00:47] OxTear: Stonks KEKW
[4:00:48] AxisZtv: look at that tiny health bar
[4:00:54] noteasys: most people level in spellscar @shroud
[4:01:02] l1tt: theres a dungeon you can get boosted in, you could do 1-50 in a few hours
[4:01:08] l1tt: its called skyreach i think
[4:01:09] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[4:01:10] xxalostmanxx: oh like getting boosted
[4:01:11] Raz1872: dolmens is the way to lvl LUL
[4:01:13] geoo7x: Stream world of Warcraft
[4:01:13] Kindnuguz: it scales quickly at lower level, after level 50 or what ever it slows down
[4:01:16] Etziee: blackrose prison
[4:01:20] Frostfear: yeah boosting is a thing :/
[4:01:24] missedshockwave: You can do 1-50 in under an hour in Blackrose Prison
[4:01:24] Holdfast043: Never played this.. is it good
[4:01:26] ronnando27: is this ESO torghast?
[4:01:32] Nerio27: you can spend your CP too on an alt and craft it some gear
[4:01:44] GGEZPZgame: As a eso professional. I recommend black rose or the catacombs.
[4:01:47] BadCompany309: cuz you are in a fight
[4:01:49] noteasys: yeah its really fun and lucrative for toons that are leveled but i dont think its good for leveling
[4:01:52] Chompsy: Need an aoe ability to spam LULW
[4:02:01] bloodborne60fpsplz: If ESO had decent combat, it would be unquestionably one of the best games in the market. The content is absurd
[4:02:02] xrdawg1991x: just getting a carry through one dungeon would boost you
[4:02:03] Chompsy: Might be better with a staff maybe
[4:02:03] Frostfear: i love how altfriendly this game is actually
[4:02:03] richieg6667: !keyboard
[4:02:04] Fossabot: @richieg6667, Mike is trying out the PRO X TKL Wireless Keyboard - here's the link: https://info.shroud.fyi/gproxtkl | Don't forget to check out the Logitech shroud Edition PRO X Keyboard GX Red Linear https://load.gg/Logitech-Shroud shroudPog
[4:02:08] DellaHank: ESO is goated
[4:02:08] ayraprime: NO POTION
[4:02:10] trulytired: Game looks so bad, lmao
[4:02:13] TechianoWorkshop: wazzzuuupppp
[4:02:14] NotChronic: no skills new meta ? KEKW
[4:02:14] AxisZtv: weaving with one ability seems so weird
[4:02:18] yuaz_: @trulytired its great
[4:02:18] meocal43: take skill
[4:02:22] SirRyv: wait till you get the beam on acranist
[4:02:23] Etziee: its a taunt, @shroud

[4:02:57] BazingaBar: the other
[4:03:01] BazingaBar: yeah
[4:03:01] Raz1872: is this like a new malestrom arena?
[4:03:02] BazingaBar: this
[4:03:05] BadCompany309: first skill tree is for dps
[4:03:07] noteasys: @wommy it is!
[4:03:09] SirRyv: get fatecarver
[4:03:11] Blackman_87: best way to level new charactes is take psijic story quest and collect mages guild books and skyshards in this locations, so on 25 lvl you have lot of skill points, and fully leveled psijic and mages guild, and after you can grind xp
[4:03:14] NotChronic: weapon skills
[4:03:15] Frostfear: combat isn't this bad normally lol he's using one skill in end-game content xd
[4:03:19] the_plain_guy: @xYoussifer ESO probably has the best combat next to maybe BDS

[4:03:26] jotuze89: so its just good game
[4:03:27] dcorn1: eso combat is the best combat
[4:03:27] warloconda: ESO combat is good just there servers and desync sucks
[4:03:29] kremec: @dead_city_paranormal how could you say that :DDD
[4:03:31] ayraprime: tabatg boring
[4:03:31] RauliePolie: Can't get bored with this combat, I love it
[4:03:35] BazingaBar: TRUE

[4:48:48] daaragni: CS whole game is literally 1 of the 3 game modes COD pro's need to play..
[4:48:51] antoneclick: controller wont save you in csgo

[4:50:36] gavinthegromit: @sluuugzz he has a free hand because you only need 1 to hold a mouse 5Head
[4:50:38] LAESA1: @L4tinoR4g3 casual cod is very easy to pick up. Try comp cod
[4:50:48] trenboIoneacetate: @kayminsider just because you have aim assist doesn’t make you bad, there’s plenty of crazy controller players that can’t be rivaled
[4:50:54] trenboIoneacetate: futives is a good example
[4:50:55] ZometTheComet: iron man suit ?
[4:50:59] digitalzwizardz: If both players spend the same amount of hours who will be more skilled in the fps genre in your opinion ? @shroud
[4:51:00] Berthrandt: harcore ?

[4:51:12] kayminsider: you will laugh while being unfair until they take away your aim assist. at thast point your aim will be bad for life
[4:51:13] Hydro_OG_33: don't the CoD pros turn off aim assist?

[4:51:41] MannySJ: Aim assist andys
[4:51:44] Dungeondef: Na switching to mouse and keyboard after spending your life on controller is a struggle
[4:51:49] AdamTheMeta: You guys love to act like a controller or keyboard changes the fact that the people using them  all have the same brain. Its a genetics game just like anything else, some people have it and some people dont.
[4:51:53] AdamTheMeta: The input is just a tool

[4:52:12] ArtTuroK: too far

[4:52:40] MannySJ: You getting first shadowmourne shroud?
[4:52:48] AdamTheMeta: @paliaco Aim assist isnt cheating, otherwise the developers wouldnt code it into their games. Theres plenty of options that include aim assist or not, pick one.
[4:52:54] MaybeRespect: I hate people who say they don't hate anyone. Lies cmon
[4:52:54] moozzcow: tldr; aim assist bad
[4:52:58] l1tt: consoles are just for the poor casual gamer
[4:52:59] Metaphix: ICC ret tier bonus is nutty you're a gigapumper now
[4:53:03] IIxRequiem: It’s confusing to us why you wouldn’t play controller if you feel it is easier, good sir

[4:53:28] Tobssessxic: 5Head  . o 0  ( frosenCD )
[4:53:29] l1tt: aimbot = aim assist\
[4:53:32] ArtTuroK: thats the right phrase if everyone USINGit
[4:53:34] LAESA1: @l1tt Im poor and have a nice pc..
[4:53:37] kayminsider: you speak in favor of aim assist because it enables you to compete its that simple
[4:53:38] frohhsty: apex *cough* *cough*
[4:53:43] clinicallychilled: farlight
[4:53:43] AdamTheMeta: Ye Im all for separating competitive titles by input
[4:53:51] mr_fotwenty: apex got destroyed by fuckin crossplay
[4:53:51] AceOfHalo2: i grew up on controllers, you grew up on PC simple
[4:53:54] AetherMana: you can play halo infinite with a controller input and mouse input at the same time
[4:53:55] rand00med: include mindcontrollers too
[4:53:55] CookingWithKama: Many people have limited access to pc gaming for most of their lives, so it makes sense for a remote to be the go to. Not best but it makes sense.
[4:54:07] MannySJ: I watched my friend playing dayz on console with no aim assist, shit was hilarious
[4:54:08] AdamTheMeta: But both parties equally seem to shit on the other and make excuses for their own as if its not just an input. They are the same human beings just using a different input.
[4:54:15] kryptinator: The new cod campaign was dope you gonna try it out
[4:54:18] kayminsider: give me opt out and let them aim assist each other without gaining any skill

[4:54:41] imjuhbaited: fps mechanics still carry over despite the aim assist tbh
[4:54:47] Hydro_OG_33: why don't they just make microsoft M&K for consoles?
[4:54:47] PallythePally: My solitare apm thru the roof

[4:55:02] pglanggg: dw aim assist will be fixed in apex season 88
[4:55:03] Tux2665: I remember how back in the day in OW, Blizz massively nerfed Widow on PC, but at the same time buffed her on consoles, because noone could hit the heads ... LUL
[4:55:10] ZometTheComet: everything but the actually you know " Aim " Part but yeah

[4:55:37] daaragni: You make no sense
[4:55:42] Metaphix: thats why yeah
[4:55:42] xsilentninj4x: In CS, you just constantly change between knife and gun, punch walls with knife, and pre fire every corner in the your view?
[4:55:42] IIxRequiem: You can also choose “that edge” and that’s weird to us
[4:55:43] l1tt: i played with controller forever and its still worse
[4:55:43] kayminsider: yep
[4:55:44] ZometTheComet: I was born with a PC

[4:55:49] itsPokey: on god fr fr
[4:55:59] ZometTheComet: Got a console was like NAW Kept playin PC
[4:56:03] AetherMana: Its just a choice dude. Just because you prefer something else doesnt mean its gross choice
[4:56:14] esco1283: @Hydro_OG_33 Huh? you can use MNK on consoles, it depends on whether the game itself supports it
[4:56:16] Aypex01: I only use controller on halo, cause I never had a choice
[4:56:18] itszzben: Why are the controller players mad wht happpnd ?
[4:56:23] CoateZ: !addons
[4:56:23] Fossabot: @CoateZ Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT

[4:56:36] 4aweek: is it H ?
[4:56:39] LonelyRev: Why isn’t NA on the EU level at CS?
[4:56:50] ZometTheComet: the gaming market has been laggin behind because of consoles ! If we drop making them we can move forward faster
[4:56:51] arcanekiller_5: you can play halo on MnK?? hello?
[4:56:51] drstoogie: aim assist is just for cope
[4:56:52] LAESA1: I would like to see shroud play comp cod on Mnk or Controller. Im sure you would have fun
[4:56:58] Hydro_OG_33: @esco1283 yeah but its universally frowned upon, why not make xbox m&K and design the games to support both

[4:57:09] yassin3gaming1: the finals ?

[4:57:12] tv_nadz: !subcount
[4:57:13] Aypex01: @arcanekiller_5 not for the last 19 years of halo, you couldn’t
[4:57:25] ZometTheComet: Devs say making games for console makes the PC games worse too! So it's all bad
[4:57:25] arcanekiller_5: @LAESA1 he did and dropped nukes?
[4:57:28] CookingWithKama: I want to see shroud Play a halo tourny with remote now
[4:57:28] Chucknade: Apex had the best good balance with both imputs, I dont know why its so one sided now
[4:57:30] paliaco: Imagine playing on a console in 2023

[4:57:54] digitalzwizardz: What's your take on more fast paced games like u real tournament and quake?
[4:57:54] Bleedorang3: Youre thinking of Halo
[4:57:56] LAESA1: @arcanekiller_5 in a casual match? or an actual ranked match with decent players?
[4:57:58] SosooMad: didnt know shroud kept up with wrath

[4:58:08] Bleedorang3: Halo made some tweaks to KB/M input to bring it in line with Controller
[4:58:09] LAESA1: @arcanekiller_5 theres a difference. Casual play is not fun
[4:58:20] l1tt: fire mage is better
[4:58:22] bigcaptain8: fire mage is number one
[4:58:25] Chucknade: Deathknight cookn in your raid
[4:58:27] arcanekiller_5: @LAESA1 oh idk ranked
[4:58:28] Aypex01: @bleedorang3 true, it’s pretty solid now
[4:58:28] esco1283: @Hydro_OG_33 true, id like to see games implement servers based on imput instead of platform, that would take care of that aspect at least
[4:58:28] paliaco: Yeah
[4:58:34] HalfTrack_: You should see the WCL front page for ICC. Its almost all greens
[4:58:41] HardlyCamping: Mak'gora Paladins only Shrood vs EssmanTv?
[4:58:51] LAESA1: @arcanekiller_5 exactly my point. You dont know what you are saying and then making judgements..
[4:58:59] Tux2665: I think huntards used to be pretty good at Wrath, but you had to hit pen cap, required some good gear
[4:59:00] l1tt: #1-3 dps in the world for icc are all mages
[4:59:04] donoJay: I this wow classic ?
[4:59:05] bigcaptain8: in about a month warriors and mages will be doing a lot more than everyone else
[4:59:06] kayminsider: finally these aim assist cultists realized they only have power in numbers on reddit
[4:59:09] LAESA1: @arcanekiller_5 comp cod with actual good players is very faced paced and fun.
[4:59:13] LonelyRev: Why isn’t NA at the same level as EU at CS? Why the skill gap?
[4:59:14] deejayport: jacob going in
[4:59:19] HalfTrack_: @Tux2665 nah pen cap is only for mm. most are survival rn
[4:59:35] Hydro_OG_33: @esco1283 the whole point of crossplay was to let the entire player base play together, instead of doing aim assist they shoul just market m&k to console players
[4:59:39] arcanekiller_5: cry
[4:59:43] HalfTrack_: @Tux2665 they got trap launcher added
[4:59:47] Tux2665: Ah, nevermind then. I though MM is the spec to go
[4:59:48] ZometTheComet: EU plays for real life! NA can relax with a nice life

[5:00:05] SpitDart: Play COD? A bunch of COD controller pros are going to dominate CS???
[5:00:08] kylobren00: and players like Twistzz playing in EU
[5:00:11] ZometTheComet: Culture differences
[5:00:12] banetdf: Shroud why did u stop playing EFT?
[5:00:12] kayminsider: most ppl are opportunists so as long as aim assist is there it will be used over m&k
[5:00:13] ItsNutProfessor: thats like asking why is cod mostly na pros and not eu
[5:00:14] ScottieRippen: cod hasnt been good since mw 19 tho

[5:04:25] Inkredibehl_: @randomss88 you need 300 keybinds for WoW, would be hard on console
[5:04:36] Draygen_: Cow level reveal at blizzcon

[5:04:57] l1tt: u cant
[5:05:08] LAESA1: @kayminsider Whether there was a need or not, it has impaced alot of lives in a good way.
[5:05:11] Roo1993: @veiloflonelystars cata really isnt "classic" though, it's when the world literally got changed, it will be interesting to see what they do regardless.
[5:05:11] randomss88: @Inkredibehl_ I see where youre coming from, but its possible FF14 did it. Shit, i use to be a clicker in raid in classic back in the day
