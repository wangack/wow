[0:29:41] Masqerader: We had legendaries before so we could trash outside his dnd as bear
[0:29:54] Masqerader: *thrash
[0:29:54] Broomba: True!
[0:30:29] Daggerstry: Sadly bears got boinked
[0:30:29] Masqerader: thrash and cloak legendary were crazy op. combined with galactic guardian which melted the eyes
[0:30:33] Masqerader: knock back = stare
[0:30:38] Masqerader: sends u off the ledge
[0:31:11] Masqerader: scale
[0:31:17] Maroleb: the healing orb the spawns disorients all the mobs  I believe
[0:31:27] HavocWolf11B: Think ur supposed to save the orb for all the adds
[0:31:57] Maxoru0: is the mage tower on ptr or retail?
[0:32:00] Masqerader: orb disorients and heals which is nice, also if if those mobs get a netherstorm off on velen its gg

[0:58:02] Masqerader: You can also buy the hippogrpyh for 5k timewalk badges at the vendor by the fp in dalaran too
[0:58:21] BlueBeast33: I'm finishing MSQ tonight
[0:58:28] Frostfury: Aggramar shield tmog tho Kreygasm

[1:01:33] Malarick: Happy Birthday @towelliee.
[1:01:35] QuigsTV: @towelliee i meesup and died from a golemn right before i killed the 1st dude :(
[1:01:35] Zapotek_S: I got him at around 16% after 10 + wipes, you have to focus the little adds first and cleave the big adds with the boss
[1:01:38] Masqerader: I would recommend galactic guardian, great for melting eyes and infernals
[1:01:44] cruzeal: bear time PogChamp
[1:01:44] Daggerstry: I stg if Towelliee gets bear and I didn't after 10 hours, Ima jump off the roof
[1:02:04] Broomba: did that level 41 mount cost 100 gold plus 40 in training
[1:02:17] Masqerader: @Towelliee take galactic guardian for the moonfire bonus
[1:02:27] thave23: luffa made it so easy as bear
[1:02:29] Mallaes: Blood DK was something :V
[1:02:32] goblinknows: spent 5 hours on my pally, no luck yet
[1:02:48] MisterBongwater: I'm hoping they retune but man gdruid feelsbadman
[1:03:01] goblinknows: i think the tuning is fine IMO
[1:03:11] dutchie76: Hey Rob
[1:03:11] goblinknows: maybe im on crack KEKW
[1:03:13] Frostfury: It was MEANT to be hard, people never done Legion to get experience real shit content
[1:03:14] MisterBongwater: hey it's only gold just keep crackin
[1:03:14] Masqerader: typhoon is nice as well to get some space for the nether dudes and incap to aoe interrupt them
[1:03:24] Daggerstry: They forgot they took away all our borrowed power lol
[1:03:24] eaolq: Happy birthday!!!
[1:03:25] Sathfire: for real ppl complain about EVERYTHING
[1:03:25] xideontv: as we would say here in mexico "ningun chile les enbona"
[1:03:26] Deathleta: I had to do it twice back in the day. Once for me and once for my hubby on our DH's to get the glaive transmog. It was insane!
[1:03:55] eaolq: You were the first person i followed on here. How do I see how long I have followed you though? @Towelliee
[1:03:58] Screamnsteam: Make sure you’re specd to balance infinity
[1:03:59] MysticalOS: @goblinknows it's subjective to class/spec. some are overtuned. nery pointed out how a warlock has 100k more hp than anyone else in same dps check because reasons...there are bugs that need fixing, but fixing bugs is not equal ot nerfs.
[1:04:00] Masqerader: @goblinknows Blizzard would disagree with you, since they already acknowledged it was
[1:04:10] Aidler: cohhHi towSmile cohhWhiskey happy belated birthday @Towelliee
[1:04:13] Frostfury: Yes bigger
[1:04:14] doppel_ganger94: It is bigger.
[1:04:19] Zapotek_S: yea looks like it
[1:04:34] Daggerstry: Yeah. Circle is bigger for the bear
[1:04:59] StraightErro: can't hang out on the rim like the first time
[1:05:05] doppel_ganger94: Circle b igger and do like no damage to adds. It's silly
[1:05:07] goblinknows: @goblinknows true, i shouldve specified i was talkin bout pally
[1:05:10] Masqerader: circle size is the same just we don't got luffas and balance affinity isn't 5% anymore but 3
[1:05:14] goblinknows: @Masqerader oh wow
[1:05:24] Lemonsqze: LUL
[1:05:35] Mallaes: StinkyCheese

[1:08:18] egraves7: BabyRage all day
[1:08:19] Brodih_: happy bday T
[1:08:27] Aidler: interesting. never did MT and don't intend to do it now. not my kind of content
[1:08:35] slowfetch: i want a challenge but only a challenge i can do in less than an hour
[1:08:36] MysticalOS: my only thought is i think they shoulda had gear templates somehow. like everyone does it in same gear, and not have timewalking set gimmicking. I'd love to have the challenge then be perfectly tuned that way
[1:08:40] Masqerader: They brang it back and said you can't use shit
[1:08:43] Gameriders: whats the point if briinging back when most cant do it
[1:08:43] QuigsTV: I dont think is horrible but i do think it is overtuned.
[1:08:47] the_general01: the only thing is, we cant outgear it at all. ther's no way for us to make it easier
[1:08:47] Molvonos: Check your queue on FF
[1:08:51] Throdio: Threads like that are why Blizzard doesn't want to listen to the community
[1:08:52] ninedraft317: check que
[1:08:53] MerffTV: They absolutely stealth-buffed the MT before it went live. The Havoc DH one is completely different now than it was on the PTR jsut last weekend.
[1:08:59] Brodih_: eye decrepetude
[1:09:00] not_donnah: Sadge
[1:09:02] slowfetch: p sure it is. i remember it being like that in legion too
[1:09:08] ravelith: iTankGG subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 85 months, currently on a 85 month streak! happy birthday @Towelliee good luck with the MT!

[1:10:18] KronasKG: Hey @Towelliee we share a Bday How old are you?
[1:10:22] MerffTV: it was built around the powers and abilities we all had then too
[1:10:24] Masqerader: @Towelliee we also were able to use consumable
[1:10:31] hmasleepiez: Just let us use our shadowlands leggos during it
[1:10:42] MerffTV: especially defensive powers for DPS that has since been nerfed into the groung
[1:10:44] MerffTV: grond
[1:10:45] Frostfury: There will be hotfix don't worry as usual
[1:10:50] Zapotek_S: and another point is that we cant overgear it
[1:10:57] Molvonos: Artifact, Double Leggos, whatever that Argus bullshit was
[1:11:01] KaisenSiru: The average just needs to trial and error then
[1:11:08] Dzurky: finally completed my BM hunter mage tower, took 82 pulls, the dopamine was worth it tho
[1:11:09] Masqerader: Just let people use the legendaries
[1:11:24] Thoreya: it should be permanently up
[1:11:37] Masqerader: like the fact they disabled it, and scaled us down to the lowest possible ilvl
[1:11:39] Molvonos: SAME SIZE RIGHT?
[1:11:40] Throdio: I think a neat thing they can do is increase the ilvl each cycle. That way it nefrs over time like in legion
[1:11:42] cruzeal: wtf
[1:11:54] Daismoon: That's what she said
[1:11:55] MysticalOS: gotta remember also most people didnt do this in 7.2, they came in here with antorus gear and shit on it while overgearing it. but you cant overgear this version. so people comparing overgearing MT to now, apples to oranges
[1:12:00] chickdrummer88: HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROB! FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:12:00] Molvonos: Like comparing a normal jimmy to a micropeen, wtf
[1:12:03] MysticalOS: they need to compare 7.2 gearing it to now
[1:12:24] Carahail: that look bigger
[1:12:24] KaisenSiru: pieS
[1:12:25] Mallaes: xD

[1:12:45] Broomba: that is 2-3 times larger
[1:12:46] Masqerader: you literally never had to stand in it
[1:12:46] Ldysansa: Dam
[1:12:57] the_general01: thats actually like 300% larger
[1:13:03] Brodih_: haha just noticed the Falafel emotes
[1:13:04] Frostfury: BUT it is doable, I have been bears got the skin already
[1:13:17] assman_ny: Welcome back, hope  ya had a great B day

[1:14:09] bdna2: back in legion the bear circle was bigger than the other tanks, the trick was that with luffa you could still attack with the swipe
[1:14:13] Xailen: they literally buffed numbers all over the challenges and never had it tested it. it was added right when it was pushed to live
[1:14:41] Molvonos: Those people are playing FF, @Towelliee
[1:14:56] Frostfury: Yeah some tunings can be nice or just allow us to wear dual leggos example or even Artifact for that just short time.
[1:15:05] Zettabyte: towOny
[1:15:11] MerffTV: Yep. They did the same bullshit with dom sockets, no testing
[1:15:57] Masqerader: Blizzard always does this shit. "Fun Detect" make it worse.  They always go out of their way to make shit tedious when it should be fun.  even with the legos active it still a challenge for some
[1:16:36] ilskarius: snowflakes whining about shit being hard, just get good and commit to something instead of crying.. jesus christ
[1:17:34] Daggerstry: il, over the last 2 days, I have dedicated 18 hours to the Mage tower and do not have a single challenge complete. I do not have all the time 24/7 to get them
[1:18:25] Secondbreakfasttt: it's not bein a snowflake. can you compare rewards back in legion ones in now? and it's 2 weeks event. just think mormal jesus
[1:18:25] SpoonManes: my mage is getting his face kicked in and yeeted off left and right....sadge

[1:18:49] ninedraft317: check que
[1:18:52] MysticalOS: outside of a couple guide writers and content creators
[1:18:54] nephttv_: they upped all the numbers right before release with no testing
[1:18:57] Tigris002: Even Blizzard came out and said some are to hard for certain specs
[1:18:57] marshmallow110: it was 2 day testing
[1:18:57] Hitokiri83: opps caps
[1:18:59] MerffTV: It was tested but they stealth buffed it before it went live
[1:19:01] Crowargus: heya towelliee happy birthday my bro
[1:19:02] Masqerader: It was tested, people like how it felt, then they boost the shit out of it
[1:19:03] yonko_kt: idk why don't make it easy , so ppl was happy
[1:19:03] Fidibus89: was tested with less HP
[1:19:05] JediNeo99999: It was on PTR for ~1-2 hours total
[1:19:06] ArshK99: Isn't the whole point of the mage tower to be super difficult tho?
[1:19:08] MerffTV: especially mob health
[1:19:15] Brodih_: did you try Summit's gfuel flavor ? 2
[1:19:22] yonko_kt: not like idiot stay 10 hours for nothing

[1:19:55] Masqerader: @ilskarius you're a moron.  Shit is overtuned, Blizzard already acknowledged it.
[1:20:07] SpoonManes: og kush only bruvnight :)
[1:20:13] Malarick: good for you

[1:22:03] Secondbreakfasttt: nope
[1:22:06] wisperuna: @Towelliee is this harder or easier than in legion.
[1:22:11] maccaruso: Welcome back.  Hope you enjoyed the weekend.
[1:22:13] Austei: "how do you like your liver pickled"
[1:22:31] Mallaes: Ted? He's finished MSQ
[1:22:42] Frostfury: THink he is doing alts soon? No idea about FF14
[1:22:45] nephttv_: I'm almost certain this is harder than pre nerf mage tower when it first came out @Towelliee
[1:23:28] WukongPanda: excuse my ignorance but are the weapons u get from the mage tower the same as the oens back in legion, or completely new

[1:23:38] Secondbreakfasttt: imagine making 2 weeks event and harder with almost bs rewards. seems like blizard to me

[1:29:15] Aidler: I remember the MT as extremly hard and if that's what it is now then it is exactly as it was intended... I'd say

[1:31:13] bumpstock75: The heart of azeroth should work also
[1:31:16] MysticalOS: it's too low in damage. it doesn't scale shit up, only down
[1:31:16] RayenDark: No leggendary's work
[1:31:19] sahijy8054: Happy birthday 🎈🎂🎊🎉 Mami ♥️
[1:31:21] Secondbreakfasttt: why would i need to any of those to complete this. bc gear, old gems which people are selling those for 250k. yeah working as intended
[1:31:35] mwmain: @terror_reidey seems like we have to min max stats, consumables to even have a chance
[1:31:48] TatsukiTV: Garrosh heirloom weapons with all the gem sockets
[1:31:50] theo0ne: they said will nerfs mage tower
[1:32:35] valianya: Does the druid hall garden items work still?  What about the items from Argus like that heal over time Light bandage?
[1:32:49] board4life65: main stat
[1:32:54] AtriseOW: im rolling for versatility on my DH
[1:33:01] TatsukiTV: Main stat is what all the guides are saying
[1:33:07] KaisenSiru: Depending on the class. sometimes haste/verse
[1:33:45] TatsukiTV: if you go main stat you have to use old ones.
[1:34:09] MysticalOS: strenth gems were always called "bold" i think, so search bold
[1:34:10] TatsukiTV: Best ones are the dragon soul ones Queen's Garnet
[1:34:24] dSaipher: i'm pretty sure there's a whole wowhead post about bis mage tower gear
[1:34:28] Lemonsqze: LUL
[1:34:29] StraightErro: might wanna buy raw gems and cut them yourself
[1:34:34] nelixm88: idk  what happen with AH xD
[1:34:38] TatsukiTV: can also use one of each unique gem
[1:34:49] TatsukiTV: leviathanes eye, sabers eye, and krakens eye
[1:35:06] TatsukiTV: Leviathans*
[1:35:07] pronkk_: bold is catt
[1:35:10] pronkk_: cata
[1:35:13] Consor: bold not blood
[1:35:16] flyingmachin3: you wrote blood not bold
[1:35:19] Frostfury: I would feel so bad people spending tons to get this done then the nerf bat comes out
[1:35:24] Secondbreakfasttt: they are cheap af. my server full of vultures lol
[1:35:37] pronkk_: blood garnet is cata jc
[1:35:45] P4RC3V4L: @Towelliee happy birthday
[1:35:50] TodaysTheDayEh: FeelsBirthdayMan
[1:36:02] Dus7in: what's happening, why old gems?
[1:36:08] pronkk_: mage tower
[1:36:20] P4RC3V4L: I mean happy level up lol
[1:36:24] valianya: It was big in og mage tower, and druid hall has a stat buff from Malorne statue that you can keep up by dreamwalking to Dalaran and flying to the broken shore
[1:36:37] Zettabyte: @Towelliee re-hashing old content Kappa
[1:36:39] Secondbreakfasttt: they did the same thing in SL alpha LUL
[1:36:48] santamex: the scaling does seem messed up though
[1:37:04] 7point3: 1st boss of ramps normal has 3 socket plate chest
[1:37:07] santamex: I was doing double damage with a ilvl 50 weapon than my current one
[1:37:12] RayenDark: needs to be Chromie time for TBC gear
[1:37:27] valianya: Honestly its a neat thing to make old craftables or gear relevant
[1:37:49] RayenDark: you need a level 50 person with you for the gear to be the right ilvl

[1:37:52] Lemonsqze: LUL
[1:37:59] Frostfury: I mean Legion gear had all socket slots right? That means can bring that with you into SL
[1:38:20] TatsukiTV: can enchant the weapon with old enchants too, Crusader is bis for str but have to send it to a low level alt to put the enchant on
[1:38:35] MysticalOS: i think best way to make this work is gear templates and no borrowed power

[1:40:25] Daggerstry: The problem is, Blizz is not accounting for the loss of borrowed power from when it first came out. Couldn't beat it? Go grind more artifact power. After 30 more stacks, one shottoable
[1:41:00] valianya: I remember there are certain items in Argus that worked in tower,  I think the bandage that heals you for 2% every minute or so for 10 or 20 minutes might still work?
[1:41:09] Molvonos: Yea,. I don't think the MT was made harder, I think it wasn't touched as far as tuning is concerned versus all the power we had before.
[1:41:52] MysticalOS: i'm sure target tuning is curent content level, not antorus geared players shitting on it a year later. once they fix outliers i think it'll be more doable but still annoy casuals who never did this in 7.2 but 7.3.5 or some shit with too much gear
[1:42:10] valianya: Remember to let Velen melee stuff

[1:43:13] ninedraft317: que
[1:43:17] valianya: He does get hurt but he has a ton of health too
[1:43:24] Gingerprimer: Yeha 1 of the most fun part of the mage tower was the personal progression you could do
[1:43:25] Maydie6066: every 18 weeks
[1:43:28] Maydie6066: so like 2-3
[1:43:28] Tonberrius: 2 weeks every 6 months?
[1:43:29] board4life65: 4/5 times a year
[1:43:34] Lemonsqze: LULW
[1:43:36] Carahail: 3 ish
[1:43:44] Daggerstry: 2-3 times a year
[1:43:52] Gingerprimer: it is more 3ish
[1:44:29] Korupcija_: rotating tw every week is the move
[1:44:32] Nightshadre: happy birthday towelliee
[1:44:34] Gingerprimer: The Legion dungeons are really fun tho
[1:44:37] valianya: Time to farm Argus rep chests for uber buff items
[1:44:49] dSaipher: I really don't think prot pal is that far off. It's practice and positioning. I had lik 100 attempts when it was live, i have 10 attempts in so far and gotten to ~60%
[1:44:52] MysticalOS: i wish they'd separate timewalking from other weekly events, have a TW event always be up concurrently with other events, on a rotation
[1:44:52] Moobot: 👼 https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=476533 👼 Money raised through Extra Life supports sick and injured kids through funding critical treatments or providing pediatric medical equipment, ensuring that hospitals can provide charitable care to kids in need, and offering specialized services not otherwise covered by insurance.
[1:44:52] Daggerstry: People also want the 36/36 for the FoS lol
[1:44:57] ryanc1124: good thing they keep really fun events like pet battles instead of rotating TW more often
[1:45:06] joeyshades101: in order to do it as guardian you need to spec into boomkin and do boomkin dps
[1:45:15] valianya: Had to use Luffa
[1:45:36] the_general01: I mean luffa doesnt work right?
[1:45:36] Gingerprimer: If only luffa worked sadage
[1:45:42] AmChooka: Boomkin gang
[1:45:43] Maydie6066: @Towelliee yes it does
[1:45:45] RayenDark: pocket does work
[1:45:47] Sneekzx: @Towelliee thoughts on 9.2 so far?
[1:45:59] Nightshadre: pocket sized owrwks. wwith the red card that deals damage. It deals like 10% d amgage
[1:46:01] xPapio: time for lazerbeam GL
[1:46:09] RayenDark: as does the Wod heirloom increased damage to demons heirloom trinkets
[1:46:13] TatsukiTV: The heirloom trinket from Arcimonde also works str proc and increased dmg to demons.
[1:46:16] Daggerstry: Even Boomkin hits it like a wet noodle. My Starfires were hitting him for 36 damage
[1:46:45] valianya: I did it with Luffa, Ekowraith if I recall.  Still died before the end and the npcs finished him off and I won
[1:46:47] AmChooka: @daggerstry that hurts me
[1:47:05] JarJar_Brinkz: 500+ per repair
[1:47:06] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[1:47:24] TheZlare: Is the tower only for a limited time?
[1:47:26] Daggerstry: My 10 hour BM attempt cost me about 15k
[1:47:27] JarJar_Brinkz: its agony if also buying consumes
[1:47:28] Mecabeast: Mecabeast subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! happy birthday!
[1:47:42] AmChooka: @daggerstry Jesus Christ
[1:47:50] dSaipher: Back in my day we paid to get into this content lmao
[1:48:03] MysticalOS: i wouldn't use consumes just fel infuser and wait 15 min before attempts. be cheap
[1:48:44] Korupcija_: mage tower kinda addicting, it's like a vendetta
[1:48:49] Mecabeast: does it feel as hard as it was originally?
[1:49:22] MysticalOS: i would have expected more downloads of my mods for this. I should modify mod name to capture mage tower seaches
[1:49:25] Korupcija_: it's getting nerfed by the end of the week if that tells you the difficulity KEKW
[1:49:39] BlackOTR: How was Vegas? I am going next week. Any big change with Covid?
[1:49:49] Roaringkittylol: Korup? all mage tower fights or just this one?
[1:49:59] AmChooka: Is demon hunter noob friendly? Just hit 60 with my first character. Don’t know if I should do DH or DK next
[1:50:00] Korupcija_: some
[1:50:21] Frostfury: Progress!
[1:50:21] Roaringkittylol: Demon Hunter is very noob friendly
[1:50:27] Maydie6066: god this Mage Tower is brutal on bears
[1:50:28] Urebaldd: @AmChooka deff noob friendly
[1:50:39] Snabido: Gotta keep the queue momentum up

[1:50:45] Maydie6066: i enjoy it being challenging, but given how bad bears are without borrowed power its just rough
[1:50:49] valianya: For BM you have to use frost trap, and Intimidation as interrupts.  You don't have enough healing mitigation or typical interrupts to survive his blast rotation without them.
[1:51:12] Clicklesly: Don't drums work in this too btw?
[1:51:13] Mecabeast: I think jc posted a clip looked like a lot of kiting
[1:51:29] Maydie6066: @Clicklesly Drums do indeed work
[1:51:45] valianya: BM as in Beastmaster not Brew
[1:52:00] valianya: Drums work
[1:52:04] Daggerstry: Towelliee, all Shadowlands things are disabled. No conduits, no legendaries, no sanctum features work in mage tower
[1:52:10] dSaipher: clean Pog
[1:52:51] xmedpakx: doh got to phase 2 with havoc dh and messed up
[1:53:05] xmedpakx: grumble just dps at that point
[1:53:16] Maroleb: @valianya have you tried scare beast on the worm?
[1:53:18] valianya: Bear was brutal in Legion og tower.  His circle was huge
[1:53:18] Mecabeast: @daggerstry are legion tier working?
[1:53:37] Heavymetal87: I have been stunning him on my run out
[1:53:38] Moobot: Thanks for joining me on our 4th FFXIV Launch Party! Don't forget to support all your favorite streamers by showing a little M&M! MUTE AND MINIMIZE! Enjoy the story and have fun!
[1:53:38] Daggerstry: @Mecabeast Not that I can tell since they would all have the "Legacy Content Disabled" on them
[1:54:00] MysticalOS: Getting dicey
[1:54:33] valianya: I think scare beast will interrupt its enrage briefly but it doesn't stay cc'd
[1:55:02] Heavymetal87: Yea i put about 50 or so trys on my prot pally lmao. Shit had me pullin my hair out haha
[1:55:06] Maroleb: @valianya I used scare beast to interrupt its sonic screams only; all my other interrupts I used on tugar
[1:55:11] Heavymetal87: The shard is actually dope in there
[1:55:21] MysticalOS: if you updated DBM this morning, i fixed stats tracking for timewalking version of this in DBM. will track your timewalker wipes
[1:55:35] dSaipher: Hymnal is decent
[1:55:49] Mecabeast: what about the wrathion trinket from nyalotha?
[1:56:09] Heavymetal87: Use your heirloom demon trinket bro
[1:56:09] valianya: You have to kill them around same time, preferably worm dies first because it enrages and kills you in a few ticks
[1:56:14] Heavymetal87: I know you gotta have your heirlooms
[1:56:18] Dzurky: do you know if the weekly quest is bugged? only giving 226 iLvl cache?
[1:56:19] MysticalOS: i put old gear in void storage, trinekts in bank
[1:56:26] MysticalOS: void storage is a great old gear bank
[1:56:26] Heavymetal87: Increased damage to demons
[1:56:51] Maroleb: @valianya well I just got it on bm, I got the worm to around 70% before I killed tugar; then I popped hero and burned down the worm while interrupting the screams
[1:56:56] Heavymetal87: I was using the heirloom proc damage to demons trink
[1:57:00] Heavymetal87: Its in your heirlooms
[1:57:05] Daggerstry: @Dzurky 4 Timewalking dungeons has always given normal raid loot. It is the 4 mythic dungeons that give heroic raid loot
[1:57:15] valianya: Tugar needs all the other interrupts - the shot, frost trap, Intimidation
[1:57:18] Dzurky: @Daggerstry ty for answer
[1:57:26] MysticalOS: oh yeah the demons trinket is good, used that even during legion
[1:57:32] Maroleb: @valianya I know, thats what I did
[1:57:34] MysticalOS: the ones we got from archimonde
[2:00:05] valianya: Disc was easy with Tugar.  Shield and prydaz blocks all his damage except part of the blasts and you healed right back up
[2:00:48] billybaroo1: there are adds in the raid Kappa
[2:01:16] Holysal: how long is this back for?
[2:01:36] Maydie6066: wtf paladin horrors dont cast? absolute garbage
[2:01:37] Toast112: I am actually pretty excited about the new SWTOR expac
[2:02:00] MysticalOS: check heirlooms for archimonde demon damage trinket
[2:02:12] Maroleb: was it because of technical issues?
[2:02:12] Moobot: 👼 https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=476533 👼 Money raised through Extra Life supports sick and injured kids through funding critical treatments or providing pediatric medical equipment, ensuring that hospitals can provide charitable care to kids in need, and offering specialized services not otherwise covered by insurance.
[2:02:18] svenskavelli: kinda happy though since my bounty hunter isnt ready lol
[2:02:18] Luxthos: Luxthos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! Happy Birthday! luxthoLove luxthoJam
[2:02:24] TheUnknowing: Yeah man, pretty bummed, bought 2 months of gametime to prepare for it, now im gonna have to buy more XD
[2:02:25] Toast112: I am actually a returning player from the original game
[2:02:31] xPapio: delay is better than pulling a battlefield
[2:02:32] PokerFaceMoose: gotta get those 60 day subs
[2:02:50] Maroleb: all those people who subbed got screwed
[2:02:54] Mecabeast: maybe they didn't want to compete with 9.2 ptr and endwalker launch
[2:03:04] Aervyper: @Towelliee what you think of FF14 or you just waiting til the servers stop melting
[2:03:06] thekl0wn2: is wow even worh playing right now?
[2:03:08] Toast112: ya I just got my sith sorcerer to 75
[2:03:14] Broomba: you need the woodpecker jam
[2:03:16] Aidler: did they discover something really disastrous?
[2:03:39] JediNeo99999: Bear can reach outside the circle with boomy affinity and jumping
[2:03:49] IronFlag: my only issue with mage tower is how unfair some of the scaling stuff. some items/consumables can just be abused
[2:04:06] Heavymetal87: Check your Heirloom tab for Demon Trinket @Towelliee will make your life just that much easier
[2:04:10] Toast112: ya that has to be the case @Towelliee
[2:04:13] valianya: In og tower I got all the druid skins.  Very Legendary and specific gear dependent for druid.  I did every tower at least once.  Healer was the hardest,even worse than bear for me, and I had to literally learn how to bear tank and resto heal cuz I never played those
[2:04:14] Joga6253: can you sleep after drinking G fuel?
[2:04:20] Luxthos: It's probably marketing pushing for a date, and QA telling them for the past 6 months it's gonna be ready. And a couple weeks before release, they told me: Hey if it launch now, we're fucked.
[2:04:28] svenskavelli: ive been following PTR most of us were doubting it would come outthis month
[2:04:41] jarilrpg: @Towelliee from what ive seen from people on the PTR for SW, they were saying it wasnt ready this whole time
[2:04:51] Heavymetal87: yea
[2:04:58] TheDeathbinder: FeelsBirthdayMan
[2:05:03] Heavymetal87: Syncs to level 50 and its ilvl 52
[2:05:08] Mecabeast: @luxthos wouldn't suprise me you see that in alot of different sectors of business
[2:05:09] Toast112: atleast bioware listened and didnt release a pile of shit
[2:05:20] DevilSpire: man 14s ques are terrible right now....
[2:05:33] Aidler: swtor didn't get the neede servers from amazon NW because they still couldn't figure out the server merging - lol
[2:05:40] Maroleb: makes you wonder what happened internally
[2:05:41] IronFlag: Delaying content is the new MMO trend
[2:05:52] Toast112: ya it was probably marketing pushing for that date and QA telling them it wasnt gonna be ready the entire time
[2:05:59] Heavymetal87: I remember seeing that first video where the sith invade the jedi before the release of SWTOR... that shit had me so hype
[2:06:03] Luxthos: Sorry I worded by last message badly LOL. QA probably has been telling marketing for the past 6 months it wasn't ready and Marketing pushed for a date until the LAST possible week.
[2:06:23] Secondbreakfasttt: cuz no one playing lol
[2:06:24] TheGiant99: Lost Ark announcement tomorrow night
[2:06:55] Maroleb: 5pm PT
[2:06:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: It'll be cool to watch it on stream here
[2:06:55] mute_paladin: So in New World, are they merging the Low Pop Servers? Or are they being dumb and merging Hiuigh PPop ones first?
[2:06:58] valianya: I wonder what the old vanilla Onyxia healing trinket does in chromie timewalking

[2:08:04] Thoreya: lol
[2:08:10] ShinyLox: Where are you looking at trading off of?
[2:08:17] Heavymetal87: Well look at it this way... Battlefield 2042 decided to launch not finished... and you see what happened with that lmao

[2:10:10] TheGiant99: The Halo campaign is so good so far
[2:10:16] Sayryn: RIP all the low pop PvE players who get merged with Valhalla
[2:10:45] Mecabeast: I think we are starting to enter into an Era where games are going to take significantly more time to deliver the same quality of finished product but shareholders/marketing aren't in agreement

[2:11:50] valianya: You used moonbeam to hit the eye as bear
[2:11:54] RavenARPG: oof dude thats brutal
[2:12:18] RavenARPG: people just left that game
[2:12:34] WolfMan4500: @Mecabeast i completely agree its the corporate side that is controlling/forcing release.  i'd say most gamers would understand quality like we have no takes longer.  im sure they also fine with time between titles.
[2:12:50] Heavymetal87: Its falling off like Wildstar did after the hype
[2:12:52] WolfMan4500: have *now
[2:12:59] Mecabeast: @valianya halo has the pros of like 6yrs of dev and it being a flagship title other games not as lucky
[2:13:23] RavenARPG: the speed how fast new world is falling off is actually impressive
[2:13:26] vakaarian: I dont think this website is really accurate anymore. Steam says 86k current players which is way less than this website adding up
[2:14:07] RavenARPG: it may be just a refreshing times difference
[2:14:26] AtriseOW: steak a la mode
[2:14:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: steak yeah
[2:14:34] Heavymetal87: I hope blizzard takes some notes at the interest in solo challenges like this. Cuz alot of players tied to it right now
[2:14:49] Daggerstry: They are probably thinking it will get to be as popular as launch again
[2:14:57] valianya: Endwalker is sucking up a ton of the players who would be still in new world
[2:15:26] VileEnigma90: so can you earn the old stuff from the mage tower like the standing up white bear or no
[2:15:28] Heavymetal87: Well of course they need to tune it but yea
[2:16:01] RavenARPG: agree, 100%
[2:16:03] Heavymetal87: Tune it "correctly" Like I really dont like not being able to use my covenant abilities right now, thats our rotation we have learned to live by

[2:17:11] Heavymetal87: I had to find a new love in chasing stuff like achievements and mounts and such and not be so hardcore headed. I just came back after a 2 month break myself and am glad i did
[2:17:27] Heavymetal87: Been playing this damn game 17 years since release, think my pally 401 days played atm lol
[2:17:42] pavepawns: how many attempts we looking at?
[2:17:56] VileEnigma90: does anyone know if you can earn the old appearance for you artifacts from the mage tower now or no like the standing white bear for the druid bear form
[2:18:23] Skiby101: u cant get the white bear only the fel one
[2:18:25] Heavymetal87: FYI now would be a good time to farm them artifact appearances too. Heard its pretty easy rn
[2:18:25] Mecabeast: should just be new appearance skins

[2:53:18] RayenDark: The Mop Meta gems DO work in the lv 54 helms
[2:53:58] N3llee: they basically took the AH meta and turned it on its head.

[2:55:37] KaisenSiru: Garrosh heirmm, at least mythic, is item level 47. I was able to put Crusader on the 2Her
[2:55:37] Gendread77: Scales with toons lvl that has the wpn
[2:55:41] sarcilav: Heirlooms scale no?
[2:55:50] N3llee: Is this timewalking mage tower event a one time thing? Or will it be back the next time legion Timwalking comes up in the rotation?
[2:56:18] CritcobainTV: its busted af tho
[2:56:20] Kinghorn: it will be back with legion timewalking
[2:56:20] jarilrpg: @N3llee its up two weeks this time, after that it will be up anytime legion timewalking is up
[2:56:40] Kinghorn: but I am guessing they will announce the tower is up longer
[2:56:43] valianya: Try potion of old war?
[2:56:47] CritcobainTV: i watched Venruki do it on his monk earlier and it was his top dmg
[2:57:34] Liloxcj: how long did it take venruki?
[2:57:40] VegiXTV: I got really far into 2nd phase of tank challenge but didnt meet the dps check, im not gonna slam my head against it im gonna wait for the nerf

[2:58:06] tobbs94: I just did this on my bear after 50+ tries Pog
[2:58:11] Daggerstry: Blizz buffed Xylem for SV hunters. The SV hunter strat was to have the pet tank it and then used ranged abilities
[2:58:25] JediNeo99999: Bear can reach outside the circle with boomy affinity and jumping
[2:58:27] Blvdman: @Daggerstry so play like a hunter?
[2:58:29] Blvdman: lol
[2:58:44] Blvdman: sounds like smart SV hunters to me
[2:58:52] Daggerstry: @Blvdman Yeah... they were playing like a hunter and Blizz said it trivialized it, so they removed that ability
[2:59:04] Blvdman: rip
[2:59:10] Sassori80: me and towelliee are the same age, how are them joints holding up man lol
[3:00:13] VileEnigma90: so what all do you have to do in the mage tower to get the bear form

[3:00:44] VileEnigma90: o ok thanks man
[3:01:21] Blvdman: NUUUU ALMOST
[3:01:38] CritcobainTV: Towelliee smokes ALL the joints Kappa
[3:01:40] smooshywolf: AAAA. this challenge on any tank is so anxiety provoking man DX
[3:01:40] Gendread77: also make sure the heirloom is max upgraded to get full use outta it
[3:01:42] CritcobainTV: they don't hold up for long
[3:01:48] tobbs94: bro i had to save all blals for p2 on my druid to even have a chancet at doing this, insane shi t

[3:03:18] jarilrpg: it was like that before @Towelliee
[3:03:19] CritcobainTV: that extendo range LUL
[3:03:30] Cafe0le: you use balance affinity and dot him and cast starsurges
[3:03:37] magemaster225: the bigger circle was because of legion legendaries, its dumb its still big
[3:03:39] Davalin: WutFace

[3:04:16] CritzBTW: its like they just scaled it and didnt take any of the borrowed powers or legendaries into account
[3:04:45] DerekHuard: DerekHuard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[3:05:46] Maydie6066: i honest to god do not know how many times i can bash my bear head against this tower. im at like some 70+ pulls today
[3:06:21] TheUnknowing: yeah with this being limited, nerf it. lol
[3:06:23] pavepawns: if we count at launch of mage tower i think hardest were prot pala and fury warrior imo

[3:07:10] tobbs94: i hope they dont nerf bear challenge, so much prestige in beating it rn
[3:07:20] ixiya_ink: wiping at 3% made me wanna smash my keyboard
[3:07:35] gravess_66: how are the legion m+ dungeons?
[3:07:43] Aries_ADD: I wasn't able to complete mage tower when it came out, I main fury warrior... good god it was difficult.
[3:07:57] HASH_710: <3
[3:07:59] Cafe0le: false
[3:08:01] dalaraz: people never did clear mage tower when it came out
[3:08:03] HotHotHeals: i had the boss at 10% and one add got the boss to go back to full hp...
[3:08:03] CritcobainTV: i beat it inside the first 2 weeks SAdge
[3:08:06] CritcobainTV: Sadge
[3:08:34] Daggerstry: @tobbs94 People like you are the problem. I do not give a shit about prestige. I am tired of 18 hours of trying to get nothing
[3:08:54] pavepawns: @chie_gaming depends on fights aswell
[3:08:59] pavepawns: cause atm fury warrior is hella easy
[3:09:16] CrowCommando: I wasn't able to play enough. I got the rogue daggers and that's all. My only regret is not getting the bear appearance too, but I didn't have time :(
[3:09:22] valianya: @Maydie6066  you can get the Malorne statue buff by usind dreamwalking from tower to class hall and back, also the class hall garden items can work, and see if bear tartare speed buff still works

[3:12:07] Deneqt: did it with all 37 specs in legion but i am a bit sad that i can only cheese it a little bit with timewalking gear, not alot like i hoped :D at least there are many spell changes from back then. difficulty feels nearly the same as when it came out (at least with dk)
[3:12:11] Roc_Rizin: Classic or retail?
[3:12:23] Maydie6066: @valianya which malorne statue buff?

[3:12:49] psycothedruid: shadowlands gear
[3:12:50] Daggerstry: @Deneqt What additional spec did you do it with? There are only 36 in game now
[3:12:51] Austei: cheese i bet
[3:12:54] rockwellhb: venruki did like 4 of em with SL gear yesterday
[3:12:56] smooshywolf: I did it as prot warrior with Shadowlands gear, 243 ilevel @Towelliee
[3:12:56] TheUnknowing: if i do it I don't want to cheese it
[3:12:59] CritcobainTV: i could pop on my rogue and try it with SL gear
[3:12:59] Roc_Rizin: Lol i see your playing wow but is it retail or tbc??
[3:13:01] Tigris002: I've seen both ways beat them

[3:13:07] dalaraz: i pushed it to 30% on me enha,wearing resto gear

[3:17:10] GwenNightsong: I wonder how many people have gotten the Spellbook mount
[3:17:23] valianya: @Maydie6066 in class hall up past portal to Dalaran is a huge statue of Malorne the stag.  Talk to it or go near it and it gives yo a 10% haste buff if I recall.  But it drops if you cross zone boundary or FP.  But dreamwalking doesn't drop it.  Gotta start inside tower before aggro, dreamwalk to hall get buff, dreamwalk back if I remember how I did it.
[3:17:36] smooshywolf: Im not even gonna go for the mount personally, im not a big fan of riding on a book

[3:25:54] cowee12356995: happy birthday! :)
[3:26:04] Daggerstry: @LiteraceAD Back in Legion, I could farm AP and outgear it. I cannot do that here
[3:26:17] TheRealBonestorm: @feherlofia123 I actually think this is pretty well tuned. People are downing it in like 20 attemps which seems okay. Its supposed to be hard enough that some people just won't be able to do it
[3:27:01] valianya: As bear you have to keep adds together to aoe.  You gotta carefully stay out of infernal melee but in range of you boosted range swipe and thrash
[3:27:07] Daggerstry: @TheRealBonestorm But that is a bad philosophy to have in an MMO. People who are collectors who play every toon don't have time to master everything. They want the reward without sinking 18+ hours into it
[3:28:01] the_general01: @TheRealBonestorm blizz has already said its tuned wrong so it doesnt matter what we think.
[3:28:02] smooshywolf: @Daggerstry Agree, thts a terrible take. Its not supposed to be so hard that its impossible, its supposed to be challenging. Some classes/specs have a really rough time with it, while others its a complete cakewalk just beacuse of the spec.
[3:28:23] valianya: Bear is too hard without the massively boosted aoe range though
[3:28:32] pooney89: @smooshywolf it's fine to be honest
[3:28:36] TheRealBonestorm: @Daggerstry I mean I personally think it is okay for an MMO to have content that not 100% of the player base can do if it is skill based. It is impossible to tune something that is a challenge for skilled players and still 100% doable by even bad players
[3:28:43] HotHotHeals: how many people have cleared this?
[3:28:54] smooshywolf: @pooney89 You can't objectively say that its fine for all classes right now because its not.
[3:29:07] Zapotek_S: omg theres more

[3:29:44] SylvarGaming: mage*
[3:29:47] feherlofia123: i didnt play legion
[3:29:58] MysticalOS: the dps check for p2 is really frigging hard from what i read
[3:30:13] MysticalOS: you hit the soft enrage of incoming damage
[3:30:28] SylvarGaming: its super challenging and specifically designed for your class so you have to know how to play your class really well
[3:30:28] the_general01: he got his cast off
[3:30:29] CritcobainTV: Damn
[3:30:32] Maydie6066: @Towelliee you let him get a cast off
[3:30:34] the_general01: so he was healing as you hit him
[3:30:35] Plague_GG: plague_seraph subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 72 months! 
[3:30:36] jarilrpg: @Towelliee you missed an interrupt, he healed
[3:30:36] Daggerstry: @TheRealBonestorm Then never design an MMO
[3:30:38] Maydie6066: he heals for 5% each melee
[3:30:41] the_general01: indeed
[3:30:48] jarilrpg: they did
[3:30:52] Zapotek_S: going to bed, have fun dude :)
[3:30:52] the_general01: yeah
[3:31:05] MysticalOS: P2 was short in legion.
[3:31:06] valianya: He heals from damage you deal if he casts
[3:31:13] Cafe0le: kick twisted reflection or he ehals up
[3:31:14] Cafe0le: heals
[3:31:16] TheRealBonestorm: @Daggerstry You honestly think that a 'Good MMO' is something that even bad players can down every piece of content? lol
[3:31:47] smooshywolf: @SylvarGaming *Specifically designed to how your class *was in legion. Some of the challenges now while doable, are being approached in ways that were never a thing even back in the day in nighthold gear.
[3:31:47] MysticalOS: I never did alts in legion, just the 3 challenges for my main
[3:31:55] sluggo5869: Yo, man. Happy Birthday! Hope all is good!
[3:31:58] Daggerstry: @TheRealBonestorm A good MMO doesn't exclude people because elitest pricks want something special. It will allow all possible people to obtain something
[3:32:08] valianya: Warriors cheese his buff by reflecting it.  Then they heal when he hits them.
[3:32:10] TheUnknowing: i one shot the DH and Blood DK ones in legion lol bear and paladin probably took me the longest, warrior a bit behind bear and pally
[3:32:14] Tigris002: I had to do it w/o lufa back in legion on my druid lol it took awhile but I got it

[3:33:05] KythosMeltdown: if this is limited time, it shouldnt be this hard imo
[3:33:25] Atolanos: They already confirmed nerfs are incoming in a blue post so it'll be interesting
[3:33:37] CrowCommando: You're absolutely right. Bliz has just ben out of touch for years sadly
[3:33:46] TheRealBonestorm: @Daggerstry You're being greedy. Just because you want to collect something, doesn't mean you are entitled to it without being good at the game. Otherwise collections mean nothing if 100% of people can get them with no effort.
[3:33:50] TheUnknowing: I feel like WoW is too casual these days for things like this
[3:33:50] valianya: Its as limited as any timewalking content
[3:33:53] the_general01: its fun, but i just dont think i have it in me anymore
[3:33:53] 2MakeMe: i used to do be the top .1% did all the mount, transmog, mythic raiding, fishing, professions farming
[3:33:56] herpderpdoublederp: I am glad I got my mistweaver done first day, I don't think that will be nerfed though
[3:34:02] Liloxcj: this is for cosmetics shouldnt be this hard
[3:34:24] 2MakeMe: did LFR for transmog reeeeee
[3:35:11] Alaquane: muru rooCry
[3:35:20] zuru35: I feel like FFXIV is to easy, makes it boring
[3:35:26] Daggerstry: @TheRealBonestorm Elitests have their own content with high end PvP and M+, something like this should be able to be done by ALL in the game. Look at what they did for the anniversary mount. People did not get it, so they made it 100%. Meanwhile I sent 50 alts through Doomwalker and got it first day. Should you no longer get the anniversary items and mounts because you can't be bothered to farm it?
[3:35:27] smooshywolf: @Daggerstry Being good enough at your class to do Mage Tower doesn't make you good all aspects of the game. It means you are good enough to overcome that one specific hurdle. So the "good at the game" argument doesnt hold alot of water.
[3:35:46] 2MakeMe: i did the Ret paladin mage tower on day 1 right b4 raid lol, it was hard, but felt good
[3:35:54] valianya: It was for transmogs in og, and it took a lot longer than 2 weeks for most players to complete it
[3:36:09] Atolanos: @herpderpdoublederp that challenge is definitely getting nerfed for sure most healing classes are struggle bussing it
[3:36:19] keepcalmchris: keepcalmchris subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[3:36:34] Daggerstry: @valianya The thing is, it was available 24/7 for Legion and if you couldn't do it, you could grind more borrowed power TO DO IT
[3:36:39] LiteraceAD: @2makeme indeed its hard but like you said it felt gooood really good
[3:36:55] Alaquane: watch the npc roleplay for 20 seconds. then immediately get one shot. cool game blizzard
[3:36:55] 2MakeMe: are these Mage towers much harder now since u dont have ur legendaries? i remember u needed specific legendaries to beat it early
[3:36:57] herpderpdoublederp: @Atolanos I tried it on holy priest and yeah, it was a lot harder I think some healers have it harder
[3:37:14] valianya: Healing tower was always hard,  and its the longest per attempt of any tower
[3:37:22] Daggerstry: @TheRealBonestorm If people only want it to be challenging and the reward to be inaccessible to a large majority of the player base, it should have no reward
[3:37:29] 2MakeMe: @LiteraceAD yea definitely had to change talents and come up with strats cuz i didnt want to wait for a youtube vid on how to do it lol
[3:37:52] Atolanos: I honestly see them nerfing the challenges and then leaving the mage tower up all the time instead of every 18 weeks for 1 week. it's just insane when you can't practice it to get better
[3:38:06] snipsfan: they could do like 1 week extreamly difficult (title or reward appropriate) and each week decrease difficulty and reward accordingly. I dunno I'm on the fence but I think having some options to open it.up to as many people to  get in there and play should be the goal snd for those people to have fun and feel like they got something for whatever difficulty the could reach. but I'm easy going doesn't matter to me as long as people enjoy the content
[3:38:25] 2MakeMe: i tried the healing mage towers back in the day, and thought those were hard af
[3:38:31] Cafe0le: they shouldnt nerf it
[3:38:49] smooshywolf: @Daggerstry I think where it stops is when people start letting go of the weird pride thing that is prevalent in the community. If alot of peolpe are speaking out about something being overtuned their may be some truth to it.
[3:38:51] Atolanos: @cafe0le they already blue posted and said they are going to
[3:38:51] LiteraceAD: @2makeme i hope they dont nerf it, cuz they will if a lot people complain
[3:39:19] Atolanos: @literacead confirmed nerfs are incoming, just don't know specifics yet

[3:39:46] valianya: They need to either separate the events to each have separate rotations, or make ones like timewalking permanent optional content

[3:39:52] 2MakeMe: @LiteraceAD i dont think they should nerf it, but some things definitely need to be adjusted since we dont have Legion legendaries
[3:40:05] Kinghorn: you got this commenBless
[3:40:07] Daggerstry: @TheRealBonestorm Who cares? People deserve happiness. Not pricks shoving it in their face over their eliteness. When I played volleyball, it fucking crushed me to beat a team and see them get nothing for losing. I WANTED people to have something to show they had been there and tried
[3:40:09] Kinghorn: nm
[3:40:22] xmedpakx: good attempt
[3:40:35] MysticalOS: Looks over and velen and sees like 5 mobs eating his face "oh shit"
[3:40:38] 2MakeMe: just need to clean that one part and i think you'll get it
[3:41:13] smooshywolf: Additionally, I feel like when the word "overtuned" is thrown around sometimes peolpe think its synonomous with "impossible". I completed the Prot warrior challenge in 17 attempts, and i think there is something janky going on with the tuning there and can be adjusted downard just a bit.

[3:41:44] Trohuz: @Daggerstry as someone who always go the "participation trophy" in school sports; fuck that, like what's the point in trying if you just get rewarded anyway? i think it's fine to have some exlusivity
[3:41:49] Trohuz: *got
[3:41:52] LiteraceAD: @2makeme @atolanos still you can finish without legendries, harder ya but isn't it great when you get something from working hard to get it ?
[3:41:55] 2MakeMe: ohhh u get something new?
[3:41:56] MysticalOS: get a mount if you do 7/7, account bound

[3:42:18] MysticalOS: the flying spell tome

[3:43:00] 2MakeMe: LOL
[3:43:01] GunkaBeast: cake LUL
[3:43:02] Daggerstry: @Trohuz IT IS NOT OK TO LIMIT REWARDS IN AN MMO IF SAID REWARD IS ON A LIMITED TIME THING. What do people not get about that? It is ok to be somewhat challenging and take you 10-20 attempts. But there are people who have been trying for 18+ HOURS on this
[3:43:05] KythosMeltdown: is just the ToS armor but recolored

[3:43:33] bearfr0st: @towelliee it is also my bday today lv 31 happy bday dude
[3:43:40] KythosMeltdown: dat helmet tho KekW
[3:43:40] Trohuz: @Daggerstry i mean sure, but my solution would be to make it always accesible, not make it easier
[3:43:58] LiteraceAD: u got the transmog
[3:44:02] LiteraceAD: check it again
[3:44:05] Colt_Engineer: lol i love it when he sees something he likes, he like re processes it in his mind, like oh yeah, wait oh...yeah
[3:44:16] LiteraceAD: oh raid finder lol
[3:44:17] LiteraceAD: sorry
[3:44:40] Kinghorn: the lock set is sick
[3:44:52] 2MakeMe: dude the lock
[3:44:59] Austei: "6 hours later" just 1 more hehe
[3:45:07] Daggerstry: @Trohuz Orrrr..... make it tuned to where it ONLY takes 10-20 attempts and NOT 18+ HOURS.
[3:45:09] kokochris: damn FF14 queue let me in !!! towRee
[3:45:11] 2MakeMe: i like the warrior one, i didnt like the green
[3:45:32] xmedpakx: my ff14 q was 5k and i am in hehe weeee
[3:45:53] Trohuz: also if it takes 20 attempts for someone who's just doing completionism, it's a oneshot for everyone who actually knows their class, shouldn't they have fun trying and failing for a while too? @Daggerstry
[3:46:08] kokochris: @Medpak78 danSnow2 towRage
[3:46:10] TheUnknowing: mine was 6k, just got in @Medpak78 was like 2 and a half - 3 hours lol
[3:46:17] Kinghorn: I like the shaman set green is my fav but I cant be assed to do it
[3:46:27] xmedpakx: ya took me over 2 hours
[3:46:36] baylokk: How are you doing tonight Towellie?
[3:47:22] Nin3r101: Nin3r101 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months, currently on a 26 month streak! 
[3:47:32] Daggerstry: @Trohuz Take a look at your player base. That should be the only answer you need. Most people log into the game for at most 10 hours a week. If that. They deserve content that they can do quickly and at an average challenge equivalent to some of the longer WQ or mythic dungeons in the current content and then move on with their life
[3:48:28] KythosMeltdown: good to level 2 classes at the same time
[3:48:55] valianya: Legion og tower was limited time then rewards gone forever.  Timewalking is not always up but there's no end date for the rewards.  It took far longer for most players to complete it in Legion than its taking players now, even with tuning issues.  And they plan to nerf it
[3:48:56] Daggerstry: @Trohuz Because it is those casuals who are staying subbed and keeping the game. The majority of the higher end players are not the ones doing the PTR over and over again to find bugs and create systems and add-ons
[3:49:02] lopocamman18: hi do u hava a gf
[3:49:04] BJofBorg: Happy Birthday again Towelliee!!!

[3:49:53] Nin3r101: Happy Birthday Man!!! towHAMUP
[3:49:57] Broomba: PCE
[3:50:03] Trohuz: @Daggerstry uhh ok that's just plain wrong, especially the top players are the ones who test everything on the ptr that could give them an advantage
[3:50:18] Kromede: pepeMeltdown
[3:50:27] Daggerstry: @Trohuz So you mean ONLY raids and higher end dungeons? ;)
[3:50:41] Trohuz: no, quests too when it's a new expansion
