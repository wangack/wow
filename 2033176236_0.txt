[7:08:21] aSteamedTomato: A weaving hunter wants the epic 2h. How should he go about getting it? My answer is usually an SR run, because the whole point of SR is to get what you want

[7:17:25] gdkpgold: @gdkpgold  lmgd1Vanish

[7:18:40] perdicca: thats the ugliest tank i have ever seen
[7:18:55] aSteamedTomato: yep, for sure
[7:19:01] aSteamedTomato: so hunter gotta weave
[7:19:05] aSteamedTomato: or no melee group
[7:19:13] Grubjaw: should shaman tank go dw rune or shield ,mastery?
[7:19:21] elaox5: talents?
[7:19:31] EilasRS: yet you have 2 priests that can dispell the novas :D
[7:19:38] McAllister7: I just deciphered a scroll, and got a "Scroll of Arcane accuracy". is that lucky? or normal?
[7:19:44] aSteamedTomato: that's why I recommend all hunters to learn to weave, because you lose a lot of dps by not being in melee group, but you can't justify melee group if you don't weave.
[7:19:46] McAllister7: increased chance to hit with arcane spells by 1%
[7:19:56] bigtimerush_1989: can you make your character model cuter next time? tough to look at
