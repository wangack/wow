[12:27:20] aSteamedTomato: @emilsth people insist on trying to stuff as many of themselves into as small an area as possible just to stress the system. They will always push it to the point of degraded experiences no matter how much blizz "fixes" it.

[12:28:47] bluesector_: or hybrid frostfirebolt
[12:28:48] aSteamedTomato: @emilsth was the gameplay as responsive in general? I doubt there was anywhere near the same precision as blizz when it's not lagging (which is the vast majority of the time)
[12:28:55] bluesector_: or hybrid frostfirebolt !
[12:28:55] Yoxdaa: @jokerdtv they should do mini battle royal, that u can queue over and over for half hour and u get coins regarding ur standing with being able to land from the bus
[12:29:08] grenis_: how did gnomeregan go?
[12:29:25] bluesector_: no
[12:29:29] yowler_: respeccing gold costs are the worst thing about classic by far

[12:31:30] l1tt: can you do pom pyro yet?
[12:31:38] aSteamedTomato: @nanda_yo I've heard ferals, for example, talking about issues with most non-blizz vanilla clients and things like using abilities too fast after shifting into form taking you out of farm and whatnot.
[12:31:44] bluesector_: not super bad, also not super good. but the last talents are really good. 10% more dmg and more crit
[12:31:47] Mustygooch7: !fart 󠀀

[12:32:10] causemosmvp: Damn u got no gold
[12:32:34] bluesector_: @JokerdTV do you think FFB can be good with ignite and more crit dmg?
[12:32:42] emilsth: @aSteamedTomato i think the server core was coded to have 100 ms windows but some had lower some higher if the devs changed it
[12:32:43] aSteamedTomato: @nanda_yo I'm just doubting people who claim that private servers somehow handled traffic better for large PvP encounters. It just sounds off
[12:32:45] karldentwelve: change shoulders
[12:33:08] emilsth: @aSteamedTomato just watch videos of it :D the biggest pvp fights on youtube was private servers
[12:33:41] vacerss: it might scale better also
