[1:18:39] Broomba: @towelliee it takes some practice to get dragon riding down
[1:18:43] GamingDad77: honest opinion chat. Fastest way to get from 60-70 in Wrath?
[1:18:49] Warcraftthor: That would suck so bad if they made us run
[1:18:53] TacDuc: They had portals in Oribos, so I'm hoping that there will be a portal in the main city
[1:19:01] Poriand: Evoker seems like the new moonkin. just meh sadly

[1:25:58] natalieluxo: i got beta access and had time to explore, DF is absolutely beautiful
[1:26:09] GamingDad77: @Qazh_ i do too. But I gotta catch up to my guildies that boosted..lol

[1:34:19] Kisswani: How has the testing been so far ? @Towelliee
[1:34:46] Cetraben: they gave more runic power to heart strike which is HUGE
[1:34:47] Kisswani: raid tesing that is
[1:34:55] Dreadfrost: HUGELY gear depended dk's are
[1:35:08] theDirtyon3: he was talking about the amount of secondary stats already...saying its too much
[1:35:10] Aypex01: which tank do you ENJOY the most so far ? @Towelliee
[1:35:36] Cetraben: tombstone has no interaction with tier atm which is sad tho
[1:35:53] zeeAbe: BOLVAR
[1:35:54] TheEliteWulf: what tank feels the best
[1:36:04] olyv12: I’ve always loved the lore of DK but not the gameplay

[1:40:24] Kineticbomb: @Fleymour That's not what i meant. I was talking survivalbility. Rogue are squishy so seeing plate wearing classes die so fast is funny.

[1:47:22] Chopstix2005: @drsidd why would it be banned?
[1:47:49] drsidd: I heard they are banning some Addons
[1:48:25] Chopstix2005: @drsidd thats news to me?  you got a link
[1:48:31] valdwow: @drsidd No addons have been banned that I've heard, but Tukai from what I'm told hasn't touched Elvui at all for DF yet.
[1:48:32] zorkdaddy: A lot of people on Beta arent the greatest so i dont really look at "HEROIC" dungeons as a metric for how classes are doing either
[1:49:13] drsidd: Valdwow why is that?
[1:50:03] valdwow: idk why, but my friend who actually understands some of that stuff said there's no indication they've touched it yet.
[1:50:37] valdwow: Maybe because Elvui is quite extensive and things are changing all the time in Beta still.

[3:00:49] loutre_malgache: 25th is kind of a given. It's the end of a Sepulcher fated, which mean each raids would've had the same amount of fated weeks. abd that puts us 6 weeks before the expention coming out

[3:01:56] mavericks312: levis isnt top 3

[3:02:06] regalbeast: I like Jaren Hall from BYU
[3:02:08] Tyrammus84: as a Kentucky football fan you don't want Levis

[3:11:05] DuhCasual: Rep grinds won't be a requirement for moist things though, correct? If i want to grid end game i don't need to farm for anything?
[3:11:24] 91Niki: I also remember Ion saying only thing that wasn't account wide is player power aka gear

[3:15:45] Alepouditsa: @Exxcar i still need to max lvl my alt's NotLikeThis
[3:15:50] smashwow: @smashwow that's the problem we haven't gotten to test the job board. so they're probably defining the crafted gear as "player power"
[3:15:54] delaine: @macdaddyk544 yeah retail and beta
[3:16:26] Wulfgrym: @AureliusXV i just checked my launcher and its listed now, so i was sort of suprised
[3:16:28] Hantimilon: soulcrush + soulcarver + fooder on bottom
[3:16:40] SmygandeFizen: Kyrian sigil
[3:16:41] facerolljack: its mostly left side
[3:16:43] facerolljack: and miiddle
[3:16:46] SmygandeFizen: skip Last resort
[3:16:48] Vaellder: decree
[3:16:56] SmygandeFizen: take soul cleeve buff
[3:17:00] SmygandeFizen: and the 2 below
[3:17:08] Hantimilon: yeah ignore rightside for now

[3:24:10] mytherel: @cursor
[3:24:12] TheItalianStallion321: put them at my feet
[3:24:21] Crypticedge: The reason for Fodder over Elysian decree is down to tuning and simplicity. Fodder is easier to play and likely just the stronger option. It's possible with proper frailty windows ED might be better, we'll have to wait for sims.
[3:24:32] druidiful: just skip both
[3:24:32] tzugamo: both are for the effect...ist just ur target or ur lacation

[5:12:30] smashwow: let me know how that works
[5:12:31] Mecabeast: it's a gcd that doesnt do big dam
[5:12:36] mytherel: less buttons on a ret pally would be weird
[5:12:37] hammack52: they done want to use a ground effect that pug tanks will just pull shit out of
[5:12:39] enux337: imagine being a big dick sword swining cruader and your top dmg ability is concentrate
[5:12:48] ZephyrDraken: it does alot of dmg on beta though
[5:12:54] flebbooo: not until icc LUL
[5:13:01] mytherel: its already a first come first serve  rotation
[5:13:05] ZephyrDraken: if that tweet had anythin to say
[5:13:08] llNoTToXiCll: because the more you spin to win the more likely the chance its gonna get nerfed Kappa

[6:25:05] raye_gaming22: @Chopstix2005 they are
[6:25:05] RadRage69: and ret got nerfed as well
[6:25:06] RadRage69: kek
[6:25:17] Rictamar: Ret actually being good for once in their existence? Shocking I tell you
[6:25:25] RadRage69: good?
[6:25:32] RadRage69: you mean overly broken?
[6:25:41] KaisenSiru: They gutted everything ST that DS overtakes TV in ST situations, and didn't even touch Consecration with the 2p interaction
[6:25:41] TheCoffeebird: @gylduran not for long sadge kek
[6:25:51] RadRage69: thats 50k more dps lol
[6:25:56] raye_gaming22: @Gylduran you missed whole wrath i guess up till 3.3
[6:26:01] Rictamar: KEKW indeed, definitely won't go live like that
[6:26:19] Thoreya: and ppl were sayin ret was fine LUL  out of their minds
[6:26:21] Rictamar: or will it? LUL
[6:26:26] Chopstix2005: thats a 7mil gap
[6:26:32] iDazidan: they nerfed us to the ground
[6:26:57] Rictamar: less than two months to release chat, might be copium but shit will be broken af mark my words
[6:27:01] Breakadinn: We are complaining because they nerfed our ST into the ground. Not one person has complained about our AOE
[6:27:38] razeriel123: on beta rets are broken on ive they will be trash like always=)
[6:27:50] Rictamar: yeh nerfing the ST is a bit off when its the AOE that is broken
[6:28:10] Breakadinn: Yeah and we are still bugged lmao. Might want to fix bugs before you start tuning shit
[6:28:26] RadRage69: no unholy dk sadge
[6:28:27] danksly: boomies struggling Sadge
[6:28:35] Janigiv: those stone pillars look like that rock boss in highmaul WoD
[6:28:46] Thoreya: 2 classes that got nerfed still top 5 towDance
[6:28:48] Chopstix2005: @Janigiv yeah
[6:28:50] Mr_NiceGuy13: is that a hunter with almost top heals?
[6:28:54] Rictamar: I'm not maining pally for the first time since cata because of their current state. All 3 specs have huge issues, and the tier set bonuses are swamp ass
[6:28:59] cruzeal: @Thoreya danSad
[6:29:08] Thoreya: @Mr_NiceGuy13 thats evoker
[6:29:22] Mr_NiceGuy13: ahhh lol to close of a color lol
[6:30:19] Breakadinn: @thoreya they didn’t nerf their AOE for paladins and boomkin would have been doing 200k DPS on this fight without the nerfs.

[6:30:53] jbeastb: I haven't been paying to the xpac at all.. what's looking like the best tank so far?
[6:31:03] Thoreya: @Breakadinn tear them to the ground :)
[6:31:09] Rictamar: exactly, and Ret AOE clearly needs another nerf, but Blizz decided to nerf ST when that wasn't the issue KEKW
[6:31:38] raldrik: glad to see boomies got nerfed
[6:31:52] LightCigarette: That 101k is nuts to see, even after the nerf
[6:32:03] TotallyNotRaien: moonkin is fine
[6:32:08] TotallyNotRaien: epitome of middle of the pack dps
[6:32:19] Rictamar: well at least its "early" in the tuning phase
[6:32:26] LightCigarette: Oh Im sure it is tbh, I bet that person just knows their class super well
[6:32:28] Rictamar: maybe copium though LELW
[6:32:32] xhaven: right now it seems rets are just actually trying to make blizz nerf them into the ground? crying about ST when the aoe is more than good enough. It seems blizz choose to nerf the ST and leave the aoe up
[6:32:42] Jarlan23: they nerfed rend a couple times now
[6:33:08] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:33:19] zylverb0x: anyone having any luck getting weakauras to work in beta??
[6:33:36] Rictamar: @xhaven the AOE is broken, the spec is still bugged, and Blizz decided to go after the area that didn't need nerfing, seems dumb to me but what do I know
[6:34:44] Janigiv: whats this boss fight called?
[6:35:05] xhaven: @Gylduran what that says to me is that blizz wants ret to have aoe dmg "broken" or not, but they do not want the ST dmg on ret as a trade off
[6:35:21] Janigiv: nvm
[6:35:27] GamingDad77: @Janigiv Elemental Council
[6:35:56] Dagomarus: Do they need to die at same time ?
[6:36:26] Rictamar: @xhaven yeh its obvious they want the Consecration build to be a meta thing, its too early to say how it will all shake out imo
[6:36:37] biofreaks: so should classes overall be doing 100k dps or around 50k dps lol?
[6:37:02] Rictamar: that is the problem, no one knows where Blizz wants the classes to be based on gear and difficulty level
[6:37:04] TotallyNotRaien: its still very early in the tuning phase
[6:37:12] Onearmyof2: no clue yet, kinda the point of tuning
[6:37:56] Dagomarus: Recruitie is just on a one man mission of getting balance nerfed LUL
[6:38:04] SpyCrabbo: looks like boomies need another nerf towHeh
[6:38:08] AlphasaurusRexx: considering they are nerfing classes like rogue, ~50k mark seems like the most likely choice
[6:39:46] Ozzaii: Ah

[6:53:40] AlphasaurusRexx: @KaisenSiru some fuckin Diablo 3 shit
[6:53:59] Dagomarus: Though i think in normal it wont be tuned for people having full 4 set

[7:47:40] TotallyNotRaien: this should be a lot better
[7:48:44] Arbszy: Bear was fine before this is thrash now.

[7:51:25] TheUnknowing: paladin tier plays worlds smallest violin for you @Arbszy
[7:51:50] Arbszy: @TheUnknowing I hope Prot Pally sits at the bottom of the abyss <3
[7:51:53] TotallyNotRaien: the better thing is that it makes mangle worth using in aoe

[9:19:49] UpSlash: Big oof from this post so far
[9:19:52] UpSlash: I do not like what I am reading
[9:19:59] zeeAbe: Towelliee going to be doing a beta marathon at this pace, back to back to back to back to back testing
[9:20:13] Thoreya: i have so many things i want to say
[9:20:14] Iceteafire: borrowed power behind infinte daily mandatory grind is bad, blizzard just removes all borrowed power LUL
[9:20:27] SpoofAvatar: sounds like change for change reasons
[9:20:28] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119
[9:20:55] Iceteafire: pride was amazing
[9:20:58] Molseh: They say they got positive reactions to the affixes in SL, so they decide to go the opposite way.... brainless
[9:21:06] Holysal: They think we all hate borrowed power so they taking it all out
[9:21:08] KingSpud91: I mean, I agree with blizz at least in terms of the season 4 affix.
[9:21:23] UpSlash: They change stuff JUST to change it
[9:21:23] starknadooo: They want us to experience only pain. No joy allowed PunOko
[9:21:37] Molseh: True
[9:21:39] generaljosh721: it's always some chad looking to get a promotion for having their idea succeed
[9:21:46] bumpstock75: yep
[9:21:47] Hybridwarhawk: Yep, 100%
[9:21:48] Brutalzen: True
[9:21:58] Ryukotsu: If blizz actually played their own game...they might see it our way
[9:22:02] Thoreya: i think blizz has a real good thing with m+ and going backwards as opposed to accepting it as a major game system really shows the games flaws
[9:22:04] ThornRavencroft: Sad but true.
[9:22:07] drew0: which is why expansions are better near the end than the beginning
[9:22:09] 24sevn: fax
[9:22:11] yzino1992: welp rip heroic guilds
[9:22:11] Chopstix2005: Based on your recent feedback not the beta we had you guys test.....
[9:22:13] teimos42: the illusion of content
[9:22:25] teimos42: they dont have to work as hard with that method
[9:22:28] Holysal: @Ryukotsu thats the sad thing bc they do play it
[9:22:44] Ryukotsu: Based on the positive feedback...we have proven that ur feedback is wrong xD
[9:22:48] yzino1992: they already struggeled when people in my guild had members who could clear +20s but couldn't handle sepulcher mechanics
[9:22:49] Stiffy84: crream1 crream2 crream3
[9:23:21] Lazugo: it for sure doesnt seem like it

[9:24:52] Kneckt: only took 17 seconds
[9:24:55] Kneckt: ;)
[9:24:55] raye_gaming22: ill make so mutch money boosting kekw
[9:25:00] Iceteafire: 20's at in a x.0 LUL this will be toxic for solo players that only raid
[9:25:05] Kneckt: thats awful
[9:25:08] generaljosh721: f that.. im not doing M+
[9:25:10] Iceteafire: pugging 20's
[9:25:10] piuurr: but 421 on vault and 415 with valor :D
[9:25:20] rbgdev: I only do 9s lol
[9:25:21] KingSpud91: we already knew that though?
[9:25:23] generaljosh721: the game is now over after I do Heroic raid
[9:25:28] smashwow: wtf
[9:25:28] piuurr: is spameable
[9:25:29] UpSlash: This is going to blow up in their face, I'm calling it.
[9:25:30] ethelden_13: whats the point then
[9:25:30] piuurr: raid no
[9:25:34] AthenaP47: have they played the game?
[9:25:36] Ryukotsu: hahaha that must be joking xD omg
[9:25:36] Kneckt: unless M+ is easier in DF
[9:25:38] smashwow: Ion needs to go do some M+ then
[9:25:39] Ryukotsu: they*
[9:25:43] piuurr: is 421 on vault
[9:25:44] Fenixzzz: nobodys gona do m+\
[9:25:52] piuurr: are u blind or what xd
[9:26:08] KirbysGhost: so +20 and valor = mythic raid 1st boss?
[9:26:08] KingSpud91: @piuurr hes talking about end of dungeon..
[9:26:18] Lazugo: @piuurr More respect man
[9:26:23] piuurr: cause m+ is spameable content xD
[9:26:24] Kneckt: LOL
[9:26:26] danimoto10: lmao this is bad
[9:26:29] Iceteafire: thx god i quit lol this sounds so bad, it was already bad for someone that only enjoys raiding
[9:26:31] Lazugo: its either be respectuful or get out
[9:26:35] BlueBlurPrime: that is so bad
[9:26:37] UpSlash: This is so shit lol
[9:26:43] generaljosh721: you are
[9:26:45] allisonkielle: you are
[9:26:45] smashwow: oh by far
[9:26:45] Kneckt: unless M+ is easier this sucks
[9:26:58] smashwow: but at least you're getting 421 gear
[9:26:59] tiyanigean: it cant be much higher in end-of-dungeon bos, its spammable. raid is weekly capped. it would literally kill hc/ early mythic raiding guilds
[9:27:01] board4life65: higher keys for less reward
[9:27:04] Bajablastoislol: its really bad
[9:27:05] jarilrpg: higher keys for the same reward
[9:27:08] Iceteafire: KEKW
[9:27:09] hgizaira: depends on the difficulty too
[9:27:09] Ryukotsu: Yes it might be spammable content but the chance to get that specific loot from a vault could be so slim...it could take u a whole season to get a BIS item sometimes
[9:27:09] generaljosh721: the toxicity in M+ is going to be insane
[9:27:16] KaisenSiru: +15 buyers in shambles
[9:27:21] KingSpud91: id assume 20+ are slightly easier in DF than SL
[9:27:22] TacDuc: "We want to reward people for what they want, so we up difficulty and lower loot:
[9:27:31] raye_gaming22: @KaisenSiru they will by my +20
[9:27:34] danksly: somethings not quite right CouldYouNot
[9:27:41] piuurr: but u make m+ for upgrade with valor and big vault xd
[9:27:42] board4life65: WTB +20 carry now
[9:27:48] Iceteafire: just buy a boost EZ Clap
[9:27:53] NBK_Sethus: m+ is already 4 expansions old, needs a major rework
[9:27:58] smashwow: quick can we get ion on the phone. ask him if he's been playing the game?
[9:27:58] Thoreya: i went in naguuras chat and someone told me this is fine
[9:28:01] generaljosh721: they are worse
[9:28:02] allisonkielle: biug time
[9:28:03] piuurr: ???
[9:28:03] Thoreya: i was like what
[9:28:04] smashwow: it's worse
[9:28:04] BlueBlurPrime: yes they are worse than shadowlands
[9:28:07] kennn_y: Semms worse for sure
[9:28:08] Goosemantm: thats equivalent to live for a 15 isnt it?
[9:28:08] smashwow: huge worse
[9:28:12] tiyanigean: nope
[9:28:12] generaljosh721: yes
[9:28:17] Thoreya: ill literally quit the game if its like this
[9:28:26] tiyanigean: its not max, its non-endboss ilvl
[9:28:29] zeeAbe: Yeah +15 is max item level in Shadowlands. Now they are making dungeons harder and stretching the rewards.
[9:28:29] piuurr: now u can upgrade with valor the same than fiurst boss on mm,on sl no
[9:28:31] Maxoru0: that's crazy lol
[9:28:38] jarilrpg: currently a +15 gives 288, and 304 in vault
[9:28:40] generaljosh721: they're catering to 1% of the player base again
[9:28:47] starknadooo: End of dungeon is not max upgrade
[9:28:50] Thoreya: +20 is harder than any other fuckin heroic boss foh
[9:28:52] danksly: after hc clear dungeon loot is dead except weeklies ? defeats the point of adding +20 loot no?
[9:28:53] yzino1992: its above hc
[9:28:53] Holysal: They want ppl to get gear with raiding and sub with m+
[9:28:56] Schwabingabua: on top m+ players have to wait 6 weeks for set bonis
[9:28:56] Shuttlelol: lmfao what a joke that is
[9:28:56] even__odds: makes sense to me, mythic raiding is way harder than mythic+
[9:29:09] pereadin: they need to fix it so that whatever the max threshold is, the end of dungeon is equivalent to heroic
[9:29:17] piuurr: end of the dungeon is not max upgrade ,u can upgrade to 415 valor xd
[9:29:19] smashwow: @Simmz__ what's the highest key you do?
[9:29:19] Thoreya: heroic raiding and +20 keys shouldnt be in the same sentence
[9:29:22] pereadin: If not now, once the raid is released
[9:29:25] Thoreya: at least half of the heroic raid
[9:29:30] ipendora: Write in a bug report and tell them they’re math is wrong lol
[9:29:30] Holysal: They want ppl to get gear with raiding and sub with m+
[9:29:31] Krugnar: they want us to spend more valor
[9:29:33] board4life65: your better off full clearing heroic
[9:29:35] Halrandei: I think that's actually ok since mythic is harder than m+ anyway plus it being spammable too
[9:29:36] Miertez: big oof
[9:29:41] kalamari__: dont forget the whole crafting stuff
[9:29:48] tiyanigean: i hate this, its going to force even more m+ on me, i just want to raid ffs! it also makes hc raid loot completely obsolete
[9:29:50] generaljosh721: jaydotb is typing...
[9:30:01] Thoreya: IM MAD
[9:30:04] Thoreya: :)
[9:30:09] smashwow: good thing JB is on honeymoon @Towelliee
[9:30:21] BaldPanda360: Honestly i dont think they should get mythic raid tier items..
[9:30:40] piuurr: we will get more rewards than now lol
[9:30:40] Fenwig: @Towelliee You didnt have max in SL last 2 was always higher
[9:30:42] tiyanigean: you hadnt? Jailer myth loot was 309 max from vault is 304 no?
[9:30:45] Iceteafire: why not make scaled gear, just as pvp gear is higher ilvl in pvp, scaled down in other content, and tune accordingly
[9:30:46] Fenwig: They just added a mid tier in raids
[9:30:49] Angryfist40: some people dont have time to Raid.....
[9:30:56] smashwow: @tiyanigean 311
[9:31:00] allisonkielle: It's a big fuck you to m+ players
[9:31:04] yzino1992: you get over hc gear if you upgrade it though
[9:31:05] smashwow: and vault was 304
[9:31:06] Fenwig: This is the same as Shadowlands
[9:31:08] danimoto10: why not make it just as always with +15??
[9:31:09] Shuttlelol: theyre making keys after 11 harder and reward lesser gear, nice
[9:31:09] TacDuc: Isn't that what they said they would, so you don't have to do content you don't want to
[9:31:09] danksly: swing n a miss

[9:31:15] Fenwig: Yopu just added +5 levels cause of the mid tier
[9:31:18] tiyanigean: @smashwow thank you, but my point stands
[9:31:19] Fenwig: There is no diffrence
[9:31:21] BunnyMountain: we are pissed :P
[9:31:24] dizzu12: who plays retail when you can just have ur own private server source and grant you all the gear you want in the world
[9:31:25] Etzli_GG: this sounds scuffed
[9:31:25] Iceteafire: @Angryfist40 yah man, this affects raiding players too, no one wins :/
[9:31:28] Fenwig: You are wrong
[9:31:28] KingSpud91: people will complain regardless of what blizzard does..
[9:31:29] piuurr: we can get 421 on vault and 415 with valor,is more than we have now lol,???
[9:31:34] generaljosh721: yes
[9:31:36] danimoto10: ya
[9:31:37] Outlawking_Gaming: This is Fire
[9:31:37] allisonkielle: yes it di
[9:31:37] generaljosh721: that's correct
[9:31:39] Fenwig: Shadowlands last 2 raid bosses gave higher
[9:31:39] board4life65: correct
[9:31:39] tiyanigean: NO
[9:31:42] D3m0nHunt3r666: yup
[9:31:47] starknadooo: Not even in shadowslands could you have max item level. The last couple bosses on mythic gave higher ilvl than vault
[9:31:52] tiyanigean: NO, it gave you 304 in vault, Max ilvl was 311
[9:31:52] Bajablastoislol: some seasons it was +10 lol
[9:31:53] smashwow: that was correct prior to SL
[9:32:05] piuurr: we will get more rewards than SL on m+
[9:32:10] smashwow: in legion it was a +10
[9:32:12] Schwabingabua: @Towelliee don't forget m+ players have to wait 6 weeks for sets
[9:32:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: Every season since legion was over has gotten worse and worse
[9:32:17] Halrandei: I think rewards from m+ were too much last season in sl anyways, seeing people who raid normal in mythic tier pieces just didn't sit right somehow
[9:32:40] piuurr: is better than now lol,why u say is worse
[9:32:44] Thoreya: bro
[9:32:44] Shuttlelol: making content harder for shitter rewards, no sense
[9:32:45] generaljosh721: unless the tune the difficulty down so that a 20 feels like a 15
[9:32:57] pereadin: as a M+ memer, this is absolutely terrible
[9:32:57] Lazugo: they need to have luck to drop on the vault
[9:32:57] D3m0nHunt3r666: they cant take away more loot drops . lets just take away ilvl drops :p
[9:32:59] ajbrew: That first comment on this post looked like a banger
[9:33:00] Goosemantm: it's better than SL but still not what M+ players were hoping for
[9:33:01] smashwow: @piuurr in what way. please explain
[9:33:02] pereadin: might not even play it after those changes
[9:33:03] Fenwig: @generaljosh721 Why would they you are getting better rewards for a 20
[9:33:05] Thoreya: m+ had better runs than sepulcher, why is m+ disregarded
[9:33:06] federkleid_: and if you only do LFR it's still a long wait
[9:33:12] piuurr: the max on sl is 304 and 298 with valor
[9:33:21] UpSlash: But they literally say they are increasing the dmg and health starting at +11
[9:33:21] raye_gaming22: bad for bads yes for good players this don't matter cuz we do 20s regardless
[9:33:23] Outlawking_Gaming: Tier Gear should be raid only period makes every content doable
[9:33:28] piuurr: now we will get same ilvl than half boses mm and first boses with valor
[9:33:29] Thoreya: m+ is the future blizzard DEAL WITH IT
[9:33:35] smashwow: ok for doing 15s no?
[9:33:38] Festfolk: Well tier was always a raid only feature so, i dont mind them wating for it
[9:33:40] D3m0nHunt3r666: the problem is those ilvls dont align quite well...
[9:33:40] Arawn67: I am glad. Getting mythic + parties on some classes is awful anyway.
[9:33:48] Iceteafire: they did say they buffed scaling too from +11, 8% to 10% stats
[9:33:49] NBK_Sethus: lmao m+ is brain dead scaled content
[9:33:49] Thoreya: it literally is
[9:33:49] tiyanigean: @federkleid_ we dont even know yet what currency and where we'll get it from the setgenerator uses
[9:33:50] ArcaneMaki: The comments section is priceless
[9:33:50] Holysal: @Thoreya they will never accept that lol
[9:33:54] Thoreya: no one wants to raid anymore
[9:34:02] KaisenSiru: Raiding should have the best
[9:34:02] piuurr: nah u dont udnerstad the post bb
[9:34:04] Thoreya: @Holysal they fin should
[9:34:09] Vendralos: Raiding is the bigger time investment, so it makes a little bit of sense
[9:34:10] generaljosh721: time to re-roll the meta M+ classes cuz im not getting into a 20 on a feral druid
[9:34:14] Joemercy_: just legion
[9:34:14] Acythe: inb4 casuals crying about needing a +20
[9:34:15] nimshot: @Thoreya that is so wrong, what? Who are you generalizing about
[9:34:16] headninja1ncharge: it should raiding is the harder content
[9:34:20] tekos: link to that bluepost?
[9:34:21] StrawHatLuffy7: i'm going to hella pissed if they start going back to their own ways and not listen to the community
[9:34:27] tiyanigean: @Thoreya I want to, and I know plenty who do, if m+ wasnt suffocating us
[9:34:34] pereadin: Max hyped this post up too making it out to do positive
[9:34:39] pereadin: This shits dumb
[9:34:53] icerasta: You cant just have repeatable keys drop mythic raid level gear
[9:34:54] pereadin: to be*
[9:34:58] smashwow: inb ksm is +20s
[9:35:10] smashwow: so good luck leveling that gear
[9:35:12] Texas_Mizfit: with no borrowed power from seasonal affix ie shrouded a 20 is going to feel like a 25
[9:35:13] Holysal: Well if they want tier then raid. its simple
[9:35:16] Thoreya: peace n love <3
[9:35:18] Schwabingabua: @Towelliee pvp is the same. set bois come in and destroy pvp'ers
[9:35:19] Thoreya: have a good night
[9:35:23] D3m0nHunt3r666: lets burn twitter Kappa
[9:35:27] ArcaneMaki: <3 <3 <3
[9:35:43] Thoreya: @nimshot numbers say otherwise. ppl m+ more than raid
[9:35:43] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[9:35:43] fryd13: yeah towelliee bruv night
[9:35:48] kokochris: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[9:35:49] pereadin: EM PLUSSSSSS
[9:35:51] pereadin: Not yet
[9:36:02] pereadin: still being fixed
[9:36:10] Lazugo: it got delayed a little bit
[9:36:15] pereadin: 4-5 EST or PST?
[9:36:19] ajbrew: M0s exist
[9:36:22] pereadin: Ruby Pools
[9:36:34] nimshot: @Thoreya you said "no one" and M+ numbers are inflated because mythic raiders have to do them for gear, regardless if they like them or not
[9:36:39] Iceteafire: peace
[9:36:43] MrSlugSnail: PogChamp
[9:36:47] Alaquane: towHAMUP

[9:37:12] Thoreya: <3 love ya towelliee
[9:37:20] Lazugo: @Towelliee we have naxx tomorrow btw
[9:37:42] Artful_Dodger: o7
[9:37:55] Thoreya: @nimshot im sorry to break it to you. but the majority of the ppl of wow doesnt want to mythic raid. people much prefer 5 man content to attain best gear, mthic raiding is dwindling
[9:38:05] Thoreya: its literally just the truth rn
[9:38:43] iamjacared: !ui

[9:38:56] nimshot: None of that means that "no one wants to raid", hell, I'd just raid and skip M+ if that was viable for mythic raiding
[9:39:13] nimshot: You're omega over-generalizing it so a degree thats unhealthy
[9:39:23] Thoreya: gotcha
[9:41:38] Thoreya: should play the outro till u stream again
