[0:11:22] ama__deus: Do you guys think we won't know the runes all the way up to the launch of P2? It's only ~10 days or so now
[0:11:23] fakemejo: to be fair, we got PoM pyro mage build. that never got nerfed no why would arcane surge be fixed? SUBprise
[0:11:50] fakemejo: but again its all speculation regardless
[0:13:00] htvizzle: pom pyro is weaker than arcane surge
[0:14:38] fakemejo: yeh true, but that could oneshot ppl aswell ?
[0:15:14] htvizzle: lots of classes could "1 shot" people, but arcane surge will be a "real" one shot
[0:15:19] htvizzle: on insta cast
[0:19:06] wcked07: its already a one shot if u do it right its still a meme tho cuz its once every 2 min and you're useless afterwards
[0:19:59] testestkappa: hydra enough of this forced cringe, back to arenas until p2
[0:20:59] Pepegagodxx: @Hydramist how can I configure my 5 second mana add on to actually show the ticks INSIDE the mana bar?

[0:34:07] ama__deus: Apparently 2k people tested gnomer. Maybe they just didn't have runes for it
[0:34:27] ama__deus: Could be complete bullshit, just what I read
[0:34:56] Shiekiah: i envy your mental toughness to be able to endure soloQ wsg :D
[0:35:13] ama__deus: My main issue with priest is not knowing what to prioritise, since you have such a deep tool kit when it comes to burning/dispelling/healing/dmg NotLikeThis

[3:15:49] djdonkeyk0ng: Do you have any good Team Dignitas stories?
[3:16:08] kirk_hunts: I'm hoping for a hunter camouflage rune
[3:16:11] htvizzle: cause feign melding coils on pserv was fun
[3:17:26] kirk_hunts: I mean nerf hunter!
[3:18:39] kirk_hunts: I do really hope they fix caster dps next phase
[3:19:36] kirk_hunts: and not jsut give casters a buff to fix their class that they lose when they die and have to complete the raid before they'd get it naturally
[3:20:04] kirk_hunts: yeah
[3:20:09] kirk_hunts: it's simple
[3:20:23] kirk_hunts: it's definitely not buffing blackfathom boon
[3:20:36] kirk_hunts: that was the most insane "caster buff" like wtf
[3:20:54] kirk_hunts: they should have just given that to casters accross the board permanently not via buff
[3:21:02] psykfall69: hope the p1 crafted stuff stays relevant for p2
[3:22:25] kirk_hunts: yeah I have that on my druid fc that plus demo roar is insane
[3:22:28] ybfree09: whats the point of hitting exalted @Hydramist?
[3:22:32] kirk_hunts: it's showing for me
[3:22:34] ybfree09: what do we get
[3:22:34] letsgetgoingyo: just feels a bit restrictive that you have to have one crafting profession taken for that item
[3:22:37] htvizzle: hover over novaworldbuffs
[3:22:37] boxxyhaha: 84%
[3:22:41] htvizzle: icon
[3:22:46] bmkJR: open world map and click on the ashenvale map maybe
[3:22:50] htvizzle: "no data" rip
[3:22:52] bmkJR: sometimes its buggy
[3:23:07] letsgetgoingyo: the data is supposed to aggregate from other players around you as well as guildies
[3:23:17] letsgetgoingyo: maybe need to relog or something
[3:23:32] fichte1: I was just on alliance side chasing you casting death on you while you were running the flag

[3:24:17] lemonpi4: wanted to say thank you for the detailed guides. A lot of people make content, but few make it concise and digestible. Keep up the good work bud :)
[3:25:01] StingoX: hi hydra. are u going to stack 25 quests for p2?
[3:25:21] letsgetgoingyo: ive been so surprosed how good priest is in P1. Hope it stays that way for P2

[3:28:18] minibolts: Always wondered, is there a reason why PVPers always run original UI frames, while PVEers use custom frames/bars?
[3:28:46] letsgetgoingyo: I just join 2x SR raids, feels much better than gdkps
[3:28:47] toonits: my friend just did a gdkp on EU on his full bis feral.. 28g pot OMEGALUL

[3:30:19] Zelimeth: i ran all the way to ashenvale to notice you're on US :D
[3:30:30] cockjab: is it a bad idea to copy a bunch of your keybinds and macros? lol
[3:31:20] cockjab: the help harm macros are realy useful
[3:32:26] kirk_hunts: facts
[3:32:38] letsgetgoingyo: same, putting something on a hard bind I tend to not press it as often as I should
[3:32:40] kirk_hunts: whatever is on my 2 bind is going to get used the most
[3:32:52] Haendr: What is the better realm to start now? or it doesnt have difference

[3:36:29] 1jeka3: Hydra, can u try ur self in Dota2?
[3:36:30] htvizzle: i put shift/ctrl on my mouse and i dont use modifier + wad keybinds
[3:36:54] shawtayuk: loves a good spreadsheet our hydra xD
[3:37:16] tpleym: and even more comming
[3:37:58] psykfall69: i like to use the scroll+shift for the 2nd bar for gear swaps, hs, mount etc frees up so many binds
[3:38:07] shawtayuk: you help/harm macro a lot too right ?
[3:38:15] Dlaapo: Top notch guy and without a doubt the best WoW player of all time. Don’t even want to debate it.
[3:38:16] shawtayuk: na if you can heal yourself
[3:38:24] Mystylerocks: u leach more rep from surrounding mob tags
[3:38:25] shawtayuk: just tag the adds
[3:38:25] htvizzle: swapping bars is bad, modifier macros or a bar addon gives more bar space @psykfall69
[3:38:32] trevorlinden: No, be in party, everything the party tags u get
[3:38:32] letsgetgoingyo: the benefit is mostly to the raid - that you heal them and they dont die LUL
[3:38:32] bajseeee: Hyrda where cna i copy paste ur macros?
[3:38:42] psykfall69: @htvizzle you can use same bind twice lol
