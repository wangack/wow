[0:37:19] Contraband_3: KEKW
[0:37:24] Meetras: i just dont think the difference is crazy
[0:37:49] Meetras: the combo points seem to be the biggest argument for muti imo

[0:47:39] orcenheimer: Shadowstrike you need to be stealthed and thats no good for sustained combat IMO. You can still gouge but just not on your primary target. Ive been doing this in pvp.

[2:15:29] mlbAct: @psherotv how are you liking sod? and have you played on NA servers at all?
[2:15:31] satras12: does wsg wknd give you increased reputation too or only increased honor?
[2:15:58] Iraerus: good
[2:15:59] medskie: 1000%
[2:16:03] 7idus: exactly

[2:16:45] RoryJumping: @enjoyinftw people not playing solo in an mmo? We gotta fix that!
[2:16:45] mlbAct: and so does my whole premade tbh
[2:16:45] Iraerus: Sadge
[2:16:48] 5arping: true. they only wanna gank, and fast wins, i have seen a few streamers playing premades and at once they run into a bigger fish they cave...

[2:18:25] mlbAct: @psherotv i personally think that you shouldn’t be able to que with more than a 5 stack for “normal” bgs and then have like a whole separate section for people queuing with more than 5 people and i think that would solve it
[2:18:40] RoryJumping: @medskie same can be said for people premading dungeon runs. Nobody queues at the inn cause it sucks. Same goes for pvp
[2:18:47] Shepp22: two tap that priest right there
[2:18:51] Naeik: do it then MadgeLate
[2:18:54] Ariavo: My question is; does it even matter for them if Twitch is profitable. They own it, have a monopoly on this area and with that have big influence on t his demography. That isn't measured by just $
[2:18:55] satras12: its 1k rep for wsg you should do it :D
[2:19:10] ye1l: u loot a mark off one of the trash mobs during the event and turn it in for 1k rep, basically do 1 event for 1k rep even when ur revered+
[2:19:15] Iraerus: u loot item off one of the 3 bosses in ashenvale, 1k rep
[2:19:20] Iraerus: monkaW
[2:19:29] demonzhunter: i cant beleive they couldnt make profit
[2:19:30] mlbAct: @ariavo no it doesn’t matter. they’ve stated before that twitch is a tax write off basically
