[1:46:58] Guarok: Which healing addon do you use?  I've been using all macros with no addon and it works fine but I hear having an addon is a gamechanger for keybinding.
[1:50:54] antondondiablo: drdrajj subscribed with Prime. 
[2:08:59] Guarok: Like clique or vuhdoo or however that's spelled
[2:09:18] JacobBose: clique is nice
[2:09:25] kilhatv: You can use click casting from wow UI also
[2:11:13] tr1plus: does clique bring many benefits over mouseover macros? I just have a macro for every spell harm/help and I feel like that's sufficient
[2:11:23] tr1plus: I did run into a macro limit recently tho, so that's a bit annoying
[2:12:15] kilhatv: @tr1plus can you share an example of those macros?
[2:12:27] Guarok: That's what I've been using too but someone told me I could save space on keybinds by having an addon like that to have the same keybind use a different spell when I'm moused over a player frame.
[2:12:30] nellfin: clique doesn't do anything better than the new click casting wow has imo
[2:13:16] tr1plus: @stzca not on my pc wow is installed on atm but this is a quick google search:  #showtooltip /cast [mod:alt,@player] [@mouseover,help,nodead] HELP_SPELL; [@mouseover,harm,nodead] [harm] HARM_SPELL; HELP_SPELL
[2:13:19] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:13:36] kilhatv: @nellfin i use click casting from wow, used to use vuhdoo but i replaced it easily
[2:14:09] tr1plus: what does click casting do? I barely click anything and just mouseover my party frames. I select my prio mob to do damage and put my interupt target in focus
[2:14:28] nellfin: it does the same as clique
[2:14:46] nellfin: hover over target, press button, spell happens
[2:14:46] tr1plus: but what does clique off over simple mouseover macros?
[2:14:47] kilhatv: @tr1plus oh I got it, a macro to share same keybind.. i use that on my monk MK
[2:15:10] tr1plus: okay so, it's just an addon to help manage mouseovers then I guess instead of macros
[2:15:22] CyonDru: @tr1plus basically
[2:15:37] nellfin: essentially yes
[2:15:46] tr1plus: okay, then i'll stick with macros for now :p unless I start running out of slots on multiple characters
[2:16:07] nellfin: resto shamans run out REAL quick
[2:16:18] tr1plus: nah
[2:16:24] YdenTV: Damn, there was an avoidance helm up for 700k and it's gone.
[2:16:26] nellfin: both my priest and my shaman has bled over to general macros
[2:16:29] tr1plus: I'm 3.2k and have sufficient macros
[2:16:47] CyonDru: do not think IO and macros are related
[2:16:47] tr1plus: priest I ran out due to playing both disci & shadow
[2:16:51] nellfin: i take it you don't multispec
[2:16:58] tr1plus: indeed, shammy I don't multispec
[2:17:29] tr1plus: @CyonDru I wanted to say that I am using all skills in my toolkit and had enough macro slots available :p
[2:17:41] Ok_Kingston: JB you ever play fire emblem?
[2:17:41] kilhatv: if you use macros help/harm you must use an weak aura to track your CDs, dont you?
[2:18:00] tr1plus: @stzca yes, a basic one from wago
[2:18:06] nellfin: @stzca who doesn't play with class auras nowadays
[2:18:08] tr1plus: luxthos or affenar,
[2:18:08] CyonDru: @ok_kingston great series
[2:18:22] Roadskii: Sad seeing BDG disbanding
[2:18:42] kilhatv: @nellfin I dont play much, im 3.2k with monk healer, not a high end player though
[2:18:48] kelly_mac06: @Roadskii agreed, i think it was expected for a while now but still :(
[2:19:24] HopeThePriest: Especially when they pluck your best, and for good reason, its better money and a better shot at winning
[2:19:27] tr1plus: @stzca you have enough buttons without help/harm on monk healer?
[2:19:47] tr1plus: granted, I don't have an MMO mouse so I'm a bit limited in buttons and shift/crtl

[2:20:18] throwmasterlol: i can do it forever Gigachad
[2:20:27] CyonDru: i don’t think I’ve ever used a help harm macro jdotbThinking
[2:20:37] CyonDru: gm @kelly_mac06 jdotbComfy
[2:20:39] kilhatv: @tr1plus yep :) I'm new on druid, 2nd week doing 20s, i'm wondering which spells help/harm I should use on druid
[2:20:49] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[2:20:57] tr1plus: both of you have MMO mice then I assume?
[2:21:15] tr1plus: I have 3 bars full on shammy, and that's including at least 1 bar buttons help/harm
[2:21:16] kilhatv: @tr1plus I use alt/shift/ctrl and 2 side buttons on mouse
[2:21:19] nellfin: @stzca rejuv=moonfire, regrowth=wrath for me
[2:21:43] kilhatv: @nellfin good idea!!
[2:22:00] CyonDru: yeah I have an mmo mouse @tr1plus
[2:22:02] tr1plus: I use alt for self casts mostly, and it also breaks other stuff sometimes as I hide my ui or mute my game Kappa
[2:22:04] throwmasterlol: this might be a cooked take but if there is a REALLY easy raid tier then a lot of people might go for world first in the next
[2:22:25] Sizebot: I don't even think BDG needed to win the race, they just needed to not drop rank every tier like they did.
[2:22:49] nellfin: @Sizebot that happens when your best players keep getting eaten
[2:23:02] kilhatv: @tr1plus I dont have any self casts, i use alt for normal cast.. without alt i would be in trouble, not enough  keybinds
[2:23:06] Fraantic: @jdotb whats a good spellque ms to not get fked with globals on iridikron at bubble phase?
[2:23:19] StreamElements: TwitchLit Use your Amazon Prime account for a FREE sub to JB, unlocking  exclusive channel emotes! Terms and info here:  https://twitch.amazon.com/prime TwitchLit
[2:23:36] tr1plus: @stzca yeah exactly - still I prefer fewer buttons and just harm/help :p
[2:24:05] tr1plus: if I hover over an ally I heal, If I don't hover over anything it either does damage (if enemy targetted) or heals (if ally targeed)
[2:24:09] kilhatv: @tr1plus yep, I'm seeing now the advantage of macros, specially for druid
[2:24:27] tr1plus: I dread making a druid due to the shapeshifintg & bar management
[2:24:34] tr1plus: but I created 1, still level 10 tho Kappa
[2:24:52] CyonDru: @tr1plus it’s really not that bad cause each form has its own main bar
[2:25:08] tr1plus: yeah but I do put "main" abilities on secondary bars sometimes
[2:25:17] tr1plus: so I'll just have to play around with it
[2:25:28] tr1plus: e.g. 1,2,3 aren't main abilities for me, yet they are my main bar
[2:25:38] CyonDru: I have CDs and utility/items not on main bars
[2:25:49] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:25:50] CyonDru: so they can be used in any form
[2:25:51] kilhatv: @tr1plus really hard, I'm getting used yet.  I started to play pvp to practice more the shape shifting.. on pvp is crucial
[2:26:27] tr1plus: yeah I just need to be lvl 70 and think a bit about how to bind stuff
[2:26:31] tr1plus: but I hate levelling
[2:26:47] CyonDru: if you have gold just pay like 125 or whatever to get boosted to 70
[2:26:55] CyonDru: 125k that is
[2:27:03] nellfin: @tr1plus 60dollars and you don't have to
[2:27:24] CyonDru: it’s cheaper to buy a wow token and get boosted lol
[2:27:29] kilhatv: or wait next season, often blizz give buff exp
[2:27:36] nellfin: @CyonDru takes more time
[2:27:43] CyonDru: 2 hrs isn’t that long
[2:27:45] tr1plus: @nellfin It's a ripoff tho imho
[2:27:50] kilhatv: @CyonDru it's afk time
[2:27:57] tr1plus: @CyonDru yeah I should do some more boosts to get gold
[2:28:29] CyonDru: @stzca okay do something productive while you get boosted lol
[2:29:42] CyonDru: could just earn your gold gambling off of guildies in between raid pulls @tr1plus KEKW

[2:55:59] cajovysacok: is her ear ok ?  did she damage her hearing ?
[3:00:13] cajovysacok: just add crafted mastery
[3:01:15] Piaggio: just use leaf of the ancient protectors Kappa
[3:01:25] cajovysacok: if you would bplay 2 crafted mastery items it give you together  1200 mastery
[3:01:28] kilhatv: maybe reduce crit?
[3:02:39] kilhatv: yeah, the problem is your legs, you should swap with your head
[3:02:40] zani_eu: maybe put the bracers in the catalyst?

[3:03:20] kilhatv: I mean, swap your legs to tier
[3:03:27] cajovysacok: maybe some different talent build  for mor healing ?
[3:03:49] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:04:06] kilhatv: yep, exactly, your pants is sick, if wouldnt you could transform to tier and craft a head
[3:04:40] Hayotal: @stzca they would loose leech, cause they drop with leech. Avvoidance is the extra stat he would keep
[3:04:48] Gurragranit: Dropping NS as a standard now or just for specific dungeons?
[3:04:54] kilhatv: Legs tier gives huge Haste and a little mastery. So your crafted head you could put mastery and haste..
[3:06:41] Gurragranit: understand, ty for answer!
[3:07:52] bauwl: What are u considering here? just tuned in
[3:07:54] cajovysacok: what is the proc chance on crafted neck 30%? but passive mastery  you have it like 99% of time
[3:08:26] Guarok: I usually average around 25-30 for my lariat
[3:08:58] MicHawkh: so what would u swap for?
[3:10:19] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:10:24] bauwl: aint that qe live thing working ?
[3:10:29] cajovysacok: you have 27% versa can you get mor ?
[3:10:39] MicHawkh: thats for einstein to calculate LUL
[3:10:39] kilhatv: mastery has a cap also, like 20% dont it?
[3:11:05] Hayotal: On wowanalyzer.com you can see what mastery does for your hps on some spell
[3:11:45] deflatted: the only time I noticed a big diff  with mastery was for tranq ramps.
[3:11:50] Hayotal: its not on all spells, but grove tending and adaptive swarm atleast
[3:12:04] Hayotal: mouseover the "i"
[3:12:09] Hayotal: on statistics tab

[3:43:28] Guarok: 21 Fall.  Had a resto druid only casting rejuv on the second boss.  Wiped 2 times and disbanded.
[3:44:10] Guarok: 22 Rise, had the healer stand right in front of the boss and take the tank frontal with me and died.
[3:44:14] Guarok: 2 times
[3:44:33] devilhawk83: chrysCry oof as that happen to me on a 20 AD when I had a healer only casting Renew on Rezan's
[3:45:18] devilhawk83: @guarok Feels like people are buying boosts for IO as they are not learning the mechs

[3:47:15] flawlesslykun: @devilhawk83 i love that take. you do realise what this game is in 2024 right ? it's not just "they" it's legit the entire playerbase (including those that play in a guild / group of friends). Give me solo shuffle for everything tbh. if there is a patch that proved that it's very much necessary, it's this one
[3:47:44] flowerpwrxd: prepatch is probably gonna be a month or so too
[3:48:05] devilhawk83: Probably Mid-September and that 11.0 probably going to be mid-to-Late August

[3:56:30] 4rmamentarium: @Woood so blizzard should make mythic bosses "fun" too? thats not how this works...

[3:57:23] flawlesslykun: @ghostyyrose 100%
[3:58:21] kenpachiJoe: i guess a lot of players will share their feedback like you and blizz will make huge changes to them. they have been listening a bit more
[3:58:58] bleeppblorpp: can we hot swap hero talent trees?
[3:59:00] Lennyakalenny: Im new to resto druid in keys, can you tell me why some go full vers/haste in highkeys and some take a little mastery sacrifing some vers (going haste/mastery on lariat for example.)?

[4:37:04] CyonDru: I like grove guardians I just don’t like being forced to focus on them as sort of a main component. especially after just introducing them halfway through a patch or something.

[4:47:43] Whitewolf1441: Whitewolf1441 watched 35 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! yay
[4:47:57] Sir_Matticus: "the best" versus "far and away the best"
[4:47:57] Protracks: MW was good last tier people just hold their dumb perceptions of it still
[4:48:02] nellfin: palla has been that much the best healer atleast 2 times
[4:48:30] Protracks: yeah I mean that's just blizzard refusing to do tuning more than one time or ever at all
[4:48:46] Protracks: when they did nerf mw twice this tier the nerfs amounted to like 1% because they targetted essence font (???)
[4:48:55] wraghelm: Mornin JB - How goes the keys this AM?
[4:48:55] WingedChipmunk: @Protracks ya MW was "THAT" healer if you got all the right drops. If not then it was still equal in balance
[4:49:01] Raggu2: Monk is the only phys debuff as well. one of the specs needs to be good.
[4:49:05] Sir_Matticus: Do you think because of how underrepresented MW was, that's why they've left it so OP?  To drive people to it?
[4:49:06] nellfin: @Wmage that happens all the time

[4:50:00] Protracks: I mean if class debuffs and nonsense didnt exist you would just stack 10 sub rogues
[4:50:06] markoleptic_: all dps pretty balanced in raid tbh
[4:50:06] Blueofthenightfall: Non of them are you NEEDA TO BE on that toon
[4:50:08] Protracks: its not a unique problem to druid
[4:50:25] Oracle_WoW: everything is fine though. only sub is cracked
[4:50:35] nellfin: elem HAS to be good
[4:50:43] Blueofthenightfall: Give make a all round buff and brez for each class
[4:50:43] Sir_Matticus: the raid buff justifies the spot lol
[4:50:49] Harleybane: however, it feels really bad being that player, knowing you are just there for a certain buff and not for you as a player.
[4:51:16] Xantoszz: There's literally no reason to bring an ele shaman
[4:51:17] Protracks: I think hunter's mark does more than mystic touch
[4:51:19] Blueofthenightfall: Sham use to be so fun now its dead
[4:51:28] Protracks: people always bring up MT for some reason instead of the 2 other auras that are actually good
[4:51:34] nellfin: @Protracks mystic touch does more in the phases that actually matters
[4:52:03] nellfin: forget mystic touch, they have avoidance and healing buff
[4:52:20] Protracks: yea those are the 2 that matter MT is whatever
[4:52:20] ArrtyyTV: I'm sure it's more tbh
[4:52:48] aelysqt: sub has decent shadow dmg
[4:52:53] rabiesalex: feral?
[4:52:57] Raggu2: even those specs arent 100%. procs are msotly magic.
[4:53:11] nellfin: demo lock
[4:53:11] Oracle_WoW: Demo lock is about 70% physical. @jdotb
[4:53:17] nellfin: alo of pets are phys
[4:54:04] Oracle_WoW: a lot of warrior damage is going to nature with hero talents in TWW too.
[4:54:21] Raggu2: lock pets are only phys damage sources for monk debuff yea? They scale off int/spellpower otherwise?
[4:54:25] wraghelm: I would love to see moonkin weaving be competitive and strong
[4:54:42] ArrtyyTV: Bear depends on the build tbh
[4:54:44] ArrtyyTV: But yeah
[4:54:45] Im_anDe: some melee are mostly magic as well. Ret is 99% magic
[4:54:58] nellfin: @wraghelm birb weaving is clunky ass hell compared to cat weaving tho
[4:55:37] Im_anDe: sub
[4:56:29] markoleptic_: what are you gonna do cast rocks
[4:56:33] nellfin: @Raggu2 the phys dmg also scales with spellpower
[4:56:45] ArrtyyTV: Agreed, Monk buff in keys feels especially bad
[4:56:53] aelysqt: doesnt aug technically cast rocks
[4:56:58] Harleybane: elemental shaman could easily have earth dmg being phys
[4:57:04] maenkins: having a variety of damage types used to be a comp issue. now you can just take all magic or all phys damage in any type of content now
[4:57:05] ArrtyyTV: Because as you mentioned, there are so few classes that mostly benefit from phys buff
[4:57:06] nellfin: frost mage could be argued is physical, literally just pummeling with isicles
[4:57:10] Im_anDe: holystrike, radiant, frostfire, astral etc
[4:57:14] Xantoszz: Glacial damage
[4:57:16] Raggu2: @nellfin yea, thats what im saying,. lock pets are only, in this context, phys damage sources in reference to the monk debuff. they otherwise scale from spellpower sources.
[4:57:24] markoleptic_: Summon Rock Thrower

[4:58:06] wessawow: i think
[4:58:20] ArrtyyTV: Either that or they just nerf the damage buff, make it both phys and magic and give it to one of either DH or Monk, and then give the other one a different buff?
[4:58:28] Xantoszz: Flamestrike is fire/phys
[4:58:43] ArrtyyTV: True enough

[5:04:35] nicht_oli__: they added raidbuffs in bfa with the bring the player not the class argument LUL
[5:04:43] Whitewolf1441: chat anyone know which addon shows lfg like that/
[5:04:45] attachedwisp: 42 raiders from attachedwisp have joined! 
[5:05:47] maenkins: outlaw sometimes
[5:06:29] Raggu2: *cough* rogue *cough*
[5:07:09] Sokchoy: i got the new math you should drop pretty much the rest of your crit
[5:07:14] Sir_Matticus: Would bringing scrolls back be a bandaid?
[5:07:41] Bobugs: delete the world buffs?
[5:07:53] Sir_Matticus: Yeah.  It's just one of those things I don't think they'd touch for War Within, so I was thinking of a meantime solution
[5:08:14] maenkins: bring scrolls back???
[5:08:39] Raggu2: Swap out your flask for one boss.
[5:09:16] Sir_Matticus: I agree though.  Like, even as a druid player most of the time, not a huge fan of raid buff scene
[5:10:05] nicht_oli__: give everyone the same raidbuff that shaman has Kappa
[5:10:53] lordbeedril: says don’t bring back consumables and then says they better bring back this one consumable
[5:11:01] Sizebot: Well 4 difference classes can lust. Only 1 can give Fort. It is a good bit different
[5:11:44] lordbeedril: fair point
[5:12:55] wraghelm: Or give every healer both and thats it
[5:12:59] wraghelm: Then 4 DPS never happens
[5:13:12] tumbro: bring back fort/int scrolls 🙁
[5:13:43] wraghelm: I would just be so game for healers carrying the big raid wide stuff since you always have at least one
[5:14:00] nicht_oli__: they could fix that quite easy , remove random keys , you just get a naked + x key , you go to the key npc select the dungeon you want and add 3 raid buffs that you want , all other raidbuffs are disabled , bring the player not the class back on the menu
[5:16:10] nellfin: you don't really want to bring a warr eitherway, unless prot is good
[5:16:49] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[5:17:11] dimsy__: ye this mage + dh + dudu combo for magic damage is so strong
[5:18:11] wraghelm: DK manages to wiggle in always simply because blood is such a good raid tank
[5:18:15] Gloomyy3: I’m a healer main, but recently been playing dps and oh wow. the amount of stress I don’t have lmao. it’s too easy playing dps in comparison to a healer 😅😅
[5:19:07] wraghelm: I always try to have a DPS alt to chill on
[5:19:29] Whitewolf1441: @Gloomyy3 the stress comes from topping dps meteres
[5:19:31] Gloomyy3: I’ve been playing ret pally and offhealing when the healer lacks 😄😄
[5:20:05] Gloomyy3: I can’t help but offheal on my ret since I’m a main heals 😅😭

[6:06:19] alvarin_mistweaver: The baddest dungeon of the season
[6:08:50] Crittzle: Im of the opinion rise and TOT are the baddies. I cant time those beyond 25 and its so frustrating
[6:09:01] alvarin_mistweaver: yup
[6:09:25] Crittzle: Im also a mistweaver XD
[6:09:31] alvarin_mistweaver: <3
[6:10:10] Crittzle: although, j makes me wanna polay rdru so badly
[6:10:33] alvarin_mistweaver: Play both Rdudu isnt that simple as you might think or see here xD
[6:10:59] alvarin_mistweaver: im my opinion mana is still draining like a madman
[6:11:22] Crittzle: I dont have a problem with mana, i got a problem with trusting my hots
[6:11:38] Crittzle: so i can big dam.
[6:13:43] throwmasterlol: how do you guys deal with the debuff in the last phase?

[6:24:29] alvarin_mistweaver: THink my mana issues come from spamming to much adaptive swarm can that be?
[6:24:55] alvarin_mistweaver: xD or stacking rejuvs
[6:25:04] Crittzle: I literally took your advice of never pressing rej literally. I NEVER cast reju even while moving
[6:25:23] alvarin_mistweaver: @Crittzle Heh never cast rejuv?
[6:25:29] Crittzle: I sit like 95% mana usually outside of bosses
[6:25:34] Rampo123: @jdotb are u slowly going into rdruid main into raid too?
[6:25:45] throwmasterlol: its extremely rare for me to have mana issues on disc. am i doing something rotationally wrong you think or is priest mana just good?
[6:27:03] Crittzle: @alvarin_mistweaver Correct. You can ask him but I know he has said several times to never press it. It doesnt do anything
[6:27:29] alvarin_mistweaver: WTF so only regrow?
[6:27:34] Crittzle: only
[6:27:45] alvarin_mistweaver: and tree ofc
[6:27:54] alvarin_mistweaver: swift mend
[6:28:22] alvarin_mistweaver: but you need rejuv for ramping right?
[6:28:48] Crittzle: You talent into regrowth healing , LB, and GGs. So rejuv does very little healing and gives you a stack of harmony. But since vers > mastery - harmony isnt that great. But I am just learning as well. Id love to get more feedback.
[6:28:49] weedyy22: sometimes u press it for max hps for example dragons in Fall
[6:29:06] dark_ralouque: yo we play convoc or in 28+ need to play three of life ?
[6:29:29] alvarin_mistweaver: we dont use convoke anymore right?
[6:29:39] Crittzle: convoke does big dmg
[6:30:03] alvarin_mistweaver: y only in raid indeed we dont :)
[6:30:26] dark_ralouque: talk only on Mm+
[6:31:03] alvarin_mistweaver: @jdotb so you never use rejuvs in m+?
[6:31:12] Crittzle: I dont want to spread misinformation tho
[6:31:34] thatbassist: thatbassist subscribed with Prime. 
[6:32:49] Crittzle: But even looking at the break down. You casted it 52 times and it did SUCH LITTLE healing. So its not great mana eff
