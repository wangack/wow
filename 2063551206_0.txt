[0:05:10] gordastico: hi cat! (and hazel)
[0:05:13] kynlaeh: kynlaeh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Good morning hazel, another sick day with soup for me
[0:05:13] Streamlabs: kynlaeh just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:05:17] heldtheline: Kira's already eyeing the desk.
[0:05:17] Krekk01: I fdinally got my legendary axe last night!
[0:05:26] saga_no: Happy Chocolate Sale day? ;P
[0:05:35] toddbrubaker: Hi Hazel!! how's my favorite doggo Moose doing?
[0:06:00] heldtheline: *metaphorically speaking, of course
[0:06:20] giveusgnomedruids: @HazelNuttyGames thanks :)
[0:06:23] jeffdmk: It snowed and I 100% blame your spring is here comment yesterday! Kappa
[0:07:06] Ujai321: Do the legion mission table add-ons still work?
[0:07:17] Mystic_Mafia_Gaming: Wheres a good place to research mounts and how to get them
[0:08:17] cashthb: @Mystic_Mafia_Gaming simple armory maybe
[0:08:22] Krekk01: I finally got my legendary axe last night!
[0:08:31] Ujai321: What?! Snow in WINTER?!!?
[0:08:37] TotallyNotRaien: well now its gonna be a week long blizzard
[0:08:56] anker_jym: Currently snowing here as well -_-
[0:08:57] GreenArrowed: it snowed for hours in NYC on tuesday, and it was mostly melted by the end of the day
[0:09:13] wolfcloudchaser80: @Mystic_Mafia_Gaming Simplearmory and now Wowhead has a mount specific tool for finding uncollected mounts.
[0:09:39] marbared: the new normal weather
[0:09:42] Ujai321: I did try telling them that, but they weren't very receptive to it
[0:10:15] Ujai321: Did he like the bland chicken?
[0:10:25] Mystic_Mafia_Gaming: I like the way your abilities are laid out
[0:10:29] anker_jym: What was your method to getting 5 mil for the Brutosaur back in BfA?
[0:10:39] Mystic_Mafia_Gaming: @wolfcloudchaser80 Thanks
[0:10:41] forroguetitle: should do a stream where you do AH addon set up walkthrough
[0:10:43] Ujai321: He is such a smart boy
[0:10:52] fallingupwards: We feed my 15 yr old blue heeler rotisserie chicken and vegetables lol
[0:11:05] fallingupwards: She won't eat kibble
[0:11:23] Ujai321: You sold some bracers
[0:11:31] MackPlays: Good morning cutie
[0:11:34] MaddiDJ4: bfa  was traumatic don’t blame us for not remembering
[0:11:37] Ujai321: Probably done other flipping
[0:11:44] anker_jym: Makes sense. AH flipping seems quite difficult to me lol
[0:11:50] eielwind: i keep trying to do transmog or pet farms to sell for gold but in the end i think just...gathering old world stuff like fel iron consistently might be the best way to keep getting gold and not praying for sales
[0:12:12] MaddiDJ4: tsm makes it easier
[0:12:20] cashthb: or you could not buy them!
[0:12:29] forroguetitle: doesn't your mount have a mailbox?
[0:12:30] semideykevin: How are you doing this afternoon?
[0:12:49] goplacidly56: hazelWave
[0:13:25] Ujai321: Also too risk averse
[0:13:28] saga_no: Only server-moving thing I've done is with pets - because it's easy
[0:13:33] GreenArrowed: crafting resources is my most reliable gold farm rn
[0:14:14] forroguetitle: Do you have any tips for selling items that are super rare? I have a piece that[s supposed to be worth like 2-5m but have been posting it for months
[0:14:27] saga_no: Like - find a pet that's cheap on one realm - buy it - add it to my collection; log over to another realm - put pet in cage and sell it
[0:14:29] saga_no: ez pz
[0:15:11] Ujai321: Also the 2 million price tag might be fake
[0:16:07] RadioactiveBullfrog: RadioactiveBullfrog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! <3
[0:16:07] Streamlabs: radioactivebullfrog just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:16:21] cashthb: why would they pay? you can just walk out of the store. are they stupid?
[0:16:38] anker_jym: The year is 2050. Hazel had collected every Transmog, mount, and pet in WoW. She rides off into the sunset on Moose, whonhas grown to the size of a small horse.
[0:17:03] Ujai321: Tsm prices in the tooltip can be wonky on items with realized high post rate, but extremely low sell rate. That is what I mean by 'fake'
[0:17:18] Ujai321: *relatively
[0:17:41] Ujai321: So you could have used moose as a coffee table, is what I'm hearing
[0:17:58] Katestershay: Oh! I love your wig so much!
[0:18:08] forroguetitle: how would you check prices Ujai321? I just check like oribosexchange
[0:18:19] saga_no: Could you use some of the chicken as treats?
[0:18:40] anker_jym: @forroguetitle I read that as Oribo Sex Change
[0:18:52] CoffeeASAP: FeelsOkayMan
[0:19:57] jeffdmk: The wigs are great and fun but do you have thoughts on an occasional no wig day?
[0:20:08] Ujai321: @forroguetitle yeah that, also tsm. I was never very into selling things, so I don't have any more insights, I just heard a gold making streamer talk about these high price tags
[0:20:20] anker_jym: If I had a nickel for every Kul Tiran wearing the Love Witch mog while farming Freehold, I would have two nickels. Which isn't much, but it's weird that it's happened twice.
[0:20:37] heldtheline: with the class hall quests you're doing, you might be able to use those tables for charms too; especially with the shiny/polished change
[0:20:38] Mrs_Muffyn: I have one in Shadowmoon Valley (WoD) for lvl pets and coins
[0:20:41] Kretyn: @forroguetitle what about a sex change? O_o
[0:20:41] Ujai321: Man, TLDR. What an add-on
[0:20:42] goplacidly56: goplacidly56 watched 25 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:20:55] cashthb: how about an occasional cowboy hat day?
[0:21:21] Mrs_Muffyn: Leveled 2 char. so far that way
[0:21:37] anker_jym: What is the helm piece your Kyrian Priest was just wearing?
[0:21:40] Ujai321: First we need the 5th wig reveal
[0:21:42] cashthb: I'm still pretty sure it's cheating, it's even a rule for macros that they can't make decision instead of the player, that's exactly what tldr does
[0:21:45] goplacidly56: I have a big old Kul Tiran male hunter mogged as a pirate
[0:21:48] saga_no: brb
[0:21:51] vampire_enthusiast: Just start stacking the wigs like TF2 players stack hats
[0:22:55] HazelNuttyGames: Hazeline-Lightbringer
[0:22:58] cupcakechaos013: hello hazel! just got back from baby’s doctor appointment. how are you doing today?
[0:23:10] anker_jym: Oh sweet, thanks!!
[0:23:34] cupcakechaos013: super fast haha
[0:23:40] GreenArrowed: what will you do with all of your dungeon time then
[0:23:40] Ujai321: Why are you going to a doctor that's a baby? No way they got their degree legit
[0:24:35] cupcakechaos013: @ujai321 modern medicine is wildin’ haha
[0:25:25] anker_jym: Alright. For those curious, it's the Priest tier helm from Naxx.
[0:25:57] cashthb: why would you go to a doctor that has a degree?
[0:26:12] Ujai321: If you had high hopes, you shouldn't be on a gnome. Because they are not very high..... Listen, they can't all be winners
[0:26:25] greenilladan: hello Hazel!! just wanted to say Happy Thursday, and you rock!!! I hope you have a wonderful day!
[0:26:34] cupcakechaos013: hazelTen
[0:27:06] Ujai321: You need to enlist flabby for 2s or 3s
[0:27:17] anker_jym: With SSF, can you even do dungeons and raids? Or give other players buffs?
[0:27:24] realnzall: Hey Hazel! If everything goes well I'll probably reach 690 mounts today
[0:27:30] Hippwn: I've been working toward a saddle so I can get an old vicious mount
[0:27:43] Ujai321: Listen man, you are ready
[0:27:50] Ujai321: Believe in yourself!
[0:27:55] Hippwn: I want the Hippo!
[0:28:01] Hippwn: Of course :P
[0:28:05] cashthb: how about you just complain on the forums about warriors being to weak instead of playing?
[0:28:13] TotallyNotRaien: a loaded dice instead
[0:28:38] Hippwn: What are your top vicious mount you like?
[0:28:49] Ujai321: That is the way of the Internet
[0:28:51] realnzall: I have 1 guaranteed mount if I kill the 3 next Tormentors of Torghast, and then I have a bunch of mounts from Protoform Synthesis, like at least 5 I think
[0:29:36] cashthb: how about you just complain on *stormwind general* about warriors being too weak instead of playing?
[0:29:56] Ujai321: Woohoo, healing on a prayer!
[0:30:19] cashthb: @Ujai321 on a druid?
[0:30:36] averageteacup: ooh clean bags! Dragonflight is hard on the inventory!
[0:30:39] Ujai321: I know, blame Bon Jovi
[0:30:52] MrSonicgen: Afternoon.
[0:31:49] Ujai321: Something specific, or just anything?
[0:32:03] Blatsphemare: Blatsphemare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months, currently on a 56 month streak! hazelLurk hazelShiny hazelTen good morning and good luck hazelTen
[0:32:03] Streamlabs: blatsphemare just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:32:28] Ujai321: 'you are never going to see the moonkin form' immediately shifts into moonkin form
[0:32:48] TotallyNotRaien: so oddly specific
[0:33:05] cashthb: nothing's better than presenting you're homework that you didn't do
[0:33:09] Ujai321: Heat pumps work like fridges, but the other way around
[0:33:12] Perkolate: how many subs for that explanation
[0:33:17] Deluigi: lalisa1WIGGLE lalisa1WIGGLE lalisa1WIGGLE
[0:33:54] Ujai321: That is the one thing you proclaimed to be an expert on in a recent stream
[0:33:56] little_c2222: You know how to heal in wow too
[0:34:04] zannuss: Magic
[0:34:15] blueboywiz: hazel where can i get the hair growing serum you used. Did you get it from the barbershop in stormwind
[0:34:26] marbared: heat pumps and fridges are basically two variations of the same thing
[0:34:27] wolfcloudchaser80: Technology Connections on YT is a big fan of heat pumps too, and has several videos on them.
[0:34:34] little_c2222: Yes!
[0:34:39] Ujai321: Listen, I don't know if I can explain how a fridge works. But heat pumps work like reverse fridges
[0:34:52] little_c2222: To us squishy players it does
[0:35:05] mcxoney: do you have any tips for getting oom quickly especially in raids?
[0:35:27] zannuss: Places don't have ac? That makes no sense
[0:35:34] wolfcloudchaser80: Ever notice how cans of compressed air get cold as you use them? That's the same effect.
[0:35:36] fallingupwards: In the summer here we have over 100° F days I can't imagine no AC
[0:36:05] zannuss: I have the ac running in the winter
[0:36:11] TotallyNotRaien: when hes at 90% you should be at 10%
[0:36:13] mrsbhappy: Yay I caught you live. I love your content thank you for being such a wholesome creator! I hope you have a great stream/day!!
[0:36:22] saga_no: .....aaaand back
[0:36:30] cashthb: you can also just not heal and blame the dps for not doing the mechanics
[0:36:33] juruhime: on the topic of being clueless, dyou know how the internet works?
[0:36:38] khaobz: farming bird ?
[0:36:45] Ujai321: Also wowanalyzer. Great tool to see what you are doing
[0:37:11] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Heat pumps are efficient because they simply move thermal energy from one end of the loop to the other, instead of doing lossy energy transfer from electric to thermal (or chemical to thermal).
[0:37:19] NordicSorcerer: Hi, people! :)
[0:37:23] Ujai321: It's all magic
[0:37:26] TotallyNotRaien: isnt the internet just like a signal that devices tune in to?
[0:37:28] saga_no: Hey @NordicSorcerer :)
[0:37:39] heldtheline: 'expensive lego'... i love that
[0:37:39] little_c2222: 1's and 0's
[0:37:46] anker_jym: Never been brave enough to build my own PC
[0:37:56] NordicSorcerer: Networking isn't hard at all, as long as you know binary and binary logic (and/or/not/xor). :)
[0:37:58] cashthb: well it's just a bunch of logica switches
[0:38:00] Yenma57: Good luck on the mount drop, today is the day!
[0:38:07] juruhime: in theory its understandable but like... how does it do what it does?
[0:38:09] NordicSorcerer: (I used to do networking for a living)
[0:38:28] TotallyNotRaien: do you only use max lvl characters for this farm?
[0:38:34] saga_no: Mind you - when Nordic says "isn't hard at all" ... it IS hard for us mere mortals..... LUL
[0:38:44] Ujai321: It's easy, you either understand it or you don't
[0:38:50] Ujai321: That is a binary joke
[0:38:51] jayeeb: the freehold music is still so great
[0:38:55] Hippwn: By this logic does that mean legos are cheap computers haha
[0:39:08] NordicSorcerer: I'm a bit ashamed I let my CCIE go un-renewed when my health failed me (2003), so I'm no longer a CCIE...
[0:39:19] TotallyNotRaien: i guess they are rudimentary computers
[0:39:50] saga_no: It's like me saying Japanese isn't hard at all - as long as you understand the intricacies of why they use 3 'alphabets' - sometimes 4 - to write their language and what each alphabet is supposed to be used for....
[0:39:55] anker_jym: That depends, is Lego Technic still a thing?
[0:40:04] Ujai321: Did you see that someone made some bacteria or whatever in a lab to play Doom on it?
[0:40:05] cashthb: akshually, there are legos way more expensice than computers
[0:40:23] Ujai321: It works, but it has like 1 frame every 6 hours.
[0:40:27] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[0:40:37] NordicSorcerer: @cashthb That depends on the computer... But your point is valid. ;)
[0:40:38] Ujai321: Anyway, anything can be a computer
[0:40:46] little_c2222: WutFace
[0:40:50] TotallyNotRaien: much better than my pc in valdrakken
[0:40:57] juruhime: do you run wow on max settings? its what im striving for but tech is expensive
[0:41:02] Margaret182: You're hair is gorgeous hazelLove
[0:41:11] anker_jym: @totallynotraien beat me to it lol
[0:41:17] marbared: but can it run Crysis
[0:41:42] cashthb: show it!
[0:41:42] saga_no: New goal for Science: Grow bacteria that can run Crysis
[0:41:46] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[0:41:46] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[0:41:48] Margaret182: Your* lol
[0:42:02] Margaret182: So cool
[0:42:16] NordicSorcerer: @marbared Actually Cryengine (crysis) is a lot less of a resource hog than bloatware like COD MW...
[0:42:37] TotallyNotRaien: will the mog thing come with the prepatch or launch proper?
[0:43:00] cupcakechaos013: hahah i don’t know why but “it’s a wig” got me laughing. just how to the simple and point it is
[0:43:16] cashthb: btw crysis is old, we bench mark with actually demanding games, like cyberpunk.... or quake 2
[0:43:17] cupcakechaos013: simple and to the point*
[0:43:18] Ujai321: It's the best command in twitch
[0:43:36] saga_no: Whaddayamean it's a wig? You mean Hazel didn't sprout a good 20 inches of hair OVERNIGHT?? :o
[0:43:38] TotallyNotRaien: do you have curly wigs?
[0:43:38] MaddiDJ4: you do not hide that it’s a wig lol. straight forward
[0:43:39] wolfcloudchaser80: The twitch command is just so funny
[0:43:41] anker_jym: I remember they had some issues and had to delay the white and gray Transmog update. I wonder if the same will happen with this one.
[0:44:00] cashthb: quake 2 is the only game that you can benchmark both your 2000 and 2020 pc with
[0:44:15] BoogiePonderosa: will there be wild and wacky wigs at some point?
[0:44:24] Ujai321: So how much excitement do you have banked rn?
[0:44:33] zannuss: I just want them to make a pass on BFA raids to fix some of the unsoloable fights
[0:44:39] cupcakechaos013: I’m the “Adam Sandler” mom at school drop off.
[0:44:44] MaddiDJ4: I look forward to the day hazel gets some wacky cosplay wigs
[0:44:54] Ujai321: You just said you have some excitement reserved
[0:44:58] NordicSorcerer: @cashthb Original Unreal engine (as used in Unreal and first Unreal Tournament), can be used to  benchmark anything from 1996 and up. ;)'
[0:44:58] TotallyNotRaien: 2 excitements please
[0:44:59] Ujai321: So I was curious
[0:45:02] khaobz: can we get the lightning dragon skin still in LFR ?
[0:45:04] heldtheline: before the end of this expac, I thought
[0:45:10] wolfcloudchaser80: Excitement makes one shiver, so measure it in hertz?
[0:45:13] zannuss: Yeah Ion mentioned it I believe, was hoping it was with this patch, but maybe with season 4 stuff
[0:45:20] vampire_enthusiast: They said they would look at BfA raids before the end of Dragonflight, so they've got 2 patches to do it
[0:45:25] anker_jym: I'm mostly excited to get more tier sets for Antorus. I have the skips unlocked on my main, and don't really want to do Eonar on other classes.
[0:45:38] Ujai321: Did you see that Steve Danuser left Blizzard?
[0:46:01] NordicSorcerer: (Most smartwatches nowadays have more cpu and gpu than what Unreal was made for, but the engine scales _REAL_ well, because it was made for OpenGL and not DirectX)
[0:46:13] juruhime: how long have you been farming fro the mount? ive been  doing it on and off for months but unlucky so far
[0:46:42] TotallyNotRaien: looks like spider fangs
[0:46:42] cashthb: @NordicSorcerer well technically most engines can, but it doesn't really have a point to pump out like 600 fps, while quake 2 has the rtx wrapper to terrorize your hardware wit
[0:46:43] Ujai321: It has probably been like what, 4 months now?
[0:47:35] little_c2222: 9 months
[0:47:37] saga_no: Ooh this reminds me I should roll a Draenei Warlock soon
[0:47:47] Ujai321: Yeah, you need at least two hands to measure time. Maybe 3 if you want seconds
[0:47:51] little_c2222: Wait that's his age
[0:48:30] Perkolate: youre 100% a warrior
[0:48:33] GreenArrowed: troll?
[0:48:34] Ujai321: Shock the world and make a shaman
[0:48:38] NordicSorcerer: @cashthb That's why the original Unreal engine had the console command "BenchmarkMode_TwinCastleFlyby", which used the map that was later called "facing worlds" in Unreal Tournament with _EVERYTHING_ turned up beyond normal settings. They literally predicted the need for comparative benchmarks. :)
[0:48:38] MaddiDJ4: I can make it to appointments just fine but I’m very bad at estimating when I’ll be at a place. 15 and 30 minutes are the same when I’m driving
[0:49:14] GreenArrowed: i just get everywheer extremely early, which is a wild waste of my own time, but then i'm never late
[0:49:17] anker_jym: @ujai321 "Shock" the world. I see what you did there lol
[0:49:33] wolfcloudchaser80: You just described my partner and her time management!
[0:49:39] cashthb: pet classes are so lame... be manly woman you want to be, play a leather agi class!
[0:50:14] NordicSorcerer: @cashthb And yes, I'm so ancient I actually remember the Unreal launch (I worked in the industry at the time. Let's just say it created a panic in the industry because it was a decade ahead of everybody else)
[0:50:17] cashthb: what's the point of hardcore if the outcome depends on you instead of your dodge luck
[0:50:24] Ujai321: 'cooking is easy, the meal is ready in 20 minutes!' if everything is prepped...
[0:50:26] MaddiDJ4: I had to take my dad to pick up his car from the mechanic last week. had to pick up my boyfriend too but he didn’t get home until 315, still did the math wrong and accidentally told my dad I’d be there at 3…
[0:50:30] anker_jym: As a musician I had the mantra beaten into me that if you're early, you're on time. If you're on time, you're late. If you're late, you're in trouble.
[0:50:33] Ujai321: Happens to me all the time
[0:51:02] averageteacup: being too early is not a problem, people should be grateful for that :D
[0:51:03] MaddiDJ4: @anker_jym factssss band kid things. except for me it was late is left behind
[0:51:25] NordicSorcerer: @cashthb "Epic" cheated by hiring most of Warren Spector's "Underworld" (And Shock) team when Origin started bleeding skills after getting bought by EA.
[0:51:33] saga_no: I appreciate recipes that list prep time and cooking time as two separate units of time
[0:51:58] anker_jym: @maddidj4 Yuuuuup. I've always been antsy about being late to things, but that just reinforced it lol
[0:52:46] MaddiDJ4: early in music is just accidental solo
[0:52:48] starthorium: i love watching your streams but the freehold music everyday is sending me insane hahahah LUL LUL
[0:52:52] saga_no: If you're on time you're in 7/8 and wondering what is going on
[0:52:56] anker_jym: Events, rehearsals, all the things
[0:52:56] Ujai321: "i already played all my notes earlier today, I'm done!"
[0:53:42] GreenArrowed: he looks great
[0:53:47] Ujai321: It is not the veinseeker, so no
[0:53:53] dergNwolf: vombata are precious
[0:54:00] MaddiDJ4: My step dad was in the army. So now he’s either extremely early or late, no in between. somehow I forget to include finding parking into time to get to places
[0:54:03] dergNwolf: they have funny orb snoot
[0:54:13] anker_jym: I've always thought you gave off a band kid vibe (not a bad thing, I was one too), but I never pegged you to be a trumpet player
[0:54:23] MaddiDJ4: the vombata were the only reason I farmed enlightened rep
[0:54:29] cashthb: too much
[0:54:31] eielwind: i also was a trumpet player :D
[0:54:34] wolfcloudchaser80: My partner adores wombats. I keep telling her we need to get out to Zereth Mortis and figure them out.
[0:54:55] anker_jym: Ah, that makes sense. Rentals were expensive
[0:55:03] Hulkhokie: i'm only a few dailies away from big slick and I keep forgetting to go down there
[0:55:04] anker_jym: Oh, there still definitely are stereotypes
[0:55:05] Ujai321: My former principal suggested I learn trumpet, because I was a quite kid
[0:55:11] TotallyNotRaien: im not like other girls, pink? gross
[0:55:47] saga_no: I played Clarinet because I.. felt like it and Saxophone didn't appeal to me ;P
[0:55:47] slothiest: quiet kids def got given a trombone at my school lol
[0:55:49] Ujai321: I didn't learn trumpet
[0:56:08] MaddiDJ4: I was the only girl on the drumline. which means I folded all the uniforms, made sure they wore sunscreen and brought water, etc. but also I only had to buy my own sticks so I say I chose the most cost effective instrument
[0:56:09] realnzall: Is that skip to the start also available for Horde?
[0:56:22] saga_no: If you're used to the brass - reed is *HARD* to swap to (and vice versa)
[0:56:27] NordicSorcerer: I played percussive instruments for a decade...
[0:56:50] TotallyNotRaien: that DH mog is doing things to me
[0:56:51] Nujoum: Helloo o/
[0:56:56] anker_jym: @nordicsorcerer same!
[0:57:13] MaddiDJ4: they paid me in their own ways for the uniforms. Like bringing me tea or driving me to practice before I got my license
[0:58:08] anker_jym: @maddidj4 Drumline represent!
[0:58:11] cashthb: i want to be the riddler from the arkham games! that man is full of commitment!
[0:58:24] saga_no: I played long enough to coast through 6th grade music class in the US without having to do anything, and that was it
[0:59:03] saga_no: I had learned what the other kids in class were learning already, so I was just by myself in a corner playing Garbarek by ear to my teacher's delight and dismay
[0:59:09] anker_jym: It seems the band experience is universal lol
[0:59:12] NordicSorcerer: ... Let's just say that you won't get anywhere with an instrument like a Marimba without a _LOT_ of practice...
[0:59:15] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[0:59:20] saga_no: Delight at I could do it - Dismay at that I blatantly refused to attend the school talent show
[0:59:26] MaddiDJ4: there were 2 kinds of percussionists in my school, the nerds and the football players. drove my director nuts because we’d only have half the line at any given football game
[1:00:32] Hulkhokie: my school was nationally recognized for the marching band, so a bunch of the people in it were basically the instrument equivalent of jocks
[1:00:43] MaddiDJ4: my poor director deserved better. he lost half the band because he wasn’t the guy who retired the year before, and the rest hated him because he wasn’t the guy before him
[1:00:47] cashthb: but were they trying as hard as the riddler in the arkham games?
[1:00:52] BoogiePonderosa: boy o boy!
[1:01:26] MaddiDJ4: I was going a dig and saw a boy I had to check and make sure it wasn’t you
[1:02:09] juruhime: my cat tends to jump on my shoulders when i try to avoid big aoe in raids, its always a mess and im convinced she knows what shes doing
[1:02:25] anker_jym: @hulkhokie I'm guessing Cali or Texas?
[1:02:29] anne42: My partner played rums in his high school band. But they were a serious band. It was a marching band  and they even took first in state as a marching band his senior year
[1:02:37] cashthb: the second game has like 400 riddle trophies, the main story takes like 8 hours to beat, I heard it's like 50 if you try to collect them all
[1:02:50] Hulkhokie: @anker_jym Virginia actually
[1:02:52] kryptogirrl: helloo
[1:02:57] kryptogirrl: what. are you doing today?
[1:03:09] anker_jym: @hulkhokie oooh, interesting!
[1:03:16] plainswalker75: This song absolutely slaps; I never get sick of it
[1:03:33] cupcakechaos013: i'm doing such a boring mount farm right now. feeling convinced this guy doesn't exist because i never have seen him spawn
[1:03:56] kryptogirrl: is it easy to any lvl 70 on mythic?
[1:04:07] wolfcloudchaser80: I feel like percussion often doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Give me drum centric music like Japanese kodo drumming!
[1:04:17] zannuss: I am waiting for it to go on sale next year
[1:04:19] averageteacup: i'm excited for Cata Classic
[1:04:45] cashthb: btw why is it called cash shop, I never got a cut
[1:05:00] Valheeru: hiyaaa :)
[1:05:34] Valheeru: awesome
[1:05:39] wolfcloudchaser80: Oh wait, Kodo is a music group, Taiko is the drum style.
[1:06:12] Valheeru: try getting ur dracthyr artifact :p
[1:06:13] cashthb: we could watch kung fury
[1:06:34] Perkolate: Shadowpriest Mage Tower
[1:06:49] juruhime: what are the W icons on the top right?
[1:07:01] saga_no: the Ws are boost tokens Hazel hasn't used
[1:07:04] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Taiko is the kind of drum, iirc (and _REAL_ Taiko drums are almost impossible to get hold of outside of Japan, because of the ban on international trade in the woods used for the drum shells)
[1:07:05] saga_no: level boosts
[1:07:13] RealDane: hi
[1:07:51] eielwind: got to 79% toward mount and 1732 last night...then once again lost and lost lol
[1:08:40] little_c2222: LUL
[1:09:03] saga_no: So - Hivemind - what is a good PvP class/spec that doesn't require a bajillion keybinds (DPS)?
[1:09:29] juruhime: your posture is great while gaming, wish that was me. my back suffers
[1:09:32] heldtheline: hazelFish  you got this!
[1:09:33] saga_no: (I had a "brilliant" idea but I'm not sure how it'd go..)
[1:10:04] little_c2222: That bam is loud
[1:10:16] Jyster: @HazelNuttyGames If you get the addon frame sort, you can sort frames based on group to stop that from happening :)
[1:10:32] Ryok: @saga_no maybe i'm biased but havoc DH (actually i have no idea how good they currently are in pvp but they're generally strong atm)
[1:11:19] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Yep, I remembered that at the last second. Kodo was the name of the group that introduced me to the style. It would be great fun to see an actual concert one day.
[1:11:27] GreenArrowed: ooh shuffle time
[1:11:44] little_c2222: The game sound is good it's just the bam lol MaxLOL
[1:11:53] saga_no: @Ryok my DH is currently only lvl60, so I would have to crank it up to 70 and gear it somehow
[1:12:19] cashthb: @saga_no told ya, arms, as easy as it gets, no thinking, no kiting, just smash
[1:12:45] Jyster: very important for pvp. When I healed, it always bugged me, and confused me
[1:12:56] BoogiePonderosa: just found out they allow us to convert 90 wyrm crests to 15 aspect crests..!
[1:13:19] saga_no: @cashthb if I ever play Warrior - I always go Fury cuz I don't like Arms at all
[1:15:08] cashthb: frost dk used to be my second recommendation but it's been ages since I saw one, so idk what's up with them
[1:15:41] Ryok: idk about pvp but frost dk sucks in pve currently... gotta stand in your dnd all the time D:
[1:15:44] cashthb: balanced
[1:15:49] BoogiePonderosa: i'm glad cuz you can't get those  without mythic raid or M+17
[1:15:50] eielwind: poor monk
[1:15:54] GreenArrowed: rude
[1:16:00] little_c2222: Lame
[1:16:01] eielwind: ugh!
[1:16:02] anker_jym: The heck just happened
[1:16:06] cashthb: you know what @saga_no I too recommend dh
[1:16:07] GreenArrowed: what's the penalty for leaving now?
[1:16:17] Hippwn: what a baby to leave
[1:16:41] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Funfact, the guy who introduced me to Taiko drums, was actually a "factory sponsored" drummer for Tama (way back in the 90s). Gary Wallis. He also played pretty much every other perussive instrument. Met him while I was running security for a band he used to play with, and we had an instant liking (because I treated him like a fellow drummer, not fangirled over celebrity)
[1:16:53] Jyster: its -150 cr if you leave
[1:16:54] vharakh_17: whats the vicious mount % at now
[1:17:05] BoogiePonderosa: any chance for fyrakk guide.. going for AOTC tonight. :)
[1:17:09] Prunusek: 47%
[1:17:16] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 He's probably the most acrobatic drummer I've ever met...
[1:17:19] Jyster: Yeah framesort all one word
[1:17:30] heldtheline: TRP3, that's one of my fave addons. <3
[1:17:42] BoogiePonderosa: nnooo! :D
[1:17:47] cashthb: well they also get the deserter debuff, which makes the next dps que like 10% longer
[1:17:50] azumeraa: @BoogiePonderosa I'm going tomorrow.. tomorrow? :) :P
[1:18:13] BoogiePonderosa: @azurami_ haha
[1:18:23] Jyster: @HazelNuttyGames make sure you go into the addon options and change it to group. Then you should be all set
[1:19:12] DoctorOgenki: i know i can just go investigate, but have you ever made any class guides?
[1:19:12] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Acrobatics is not something I'd often associate with drumming! Well, unless Neal Peart finally set up so many drums on stage he had to climb to reach some.
[1:19:28] Jyster: Cool thing about it, is you can put yourself whereever. I also put myself at the top
[1:20:25] anker_jym: Hazel's Disc Priest guide: Just Play Holy.
[1:20:43] heldtheline: May the Light have mercy on them.
[1:20:44] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 Look up who Gary Wallis is. He literally _HAD_ to be acrobatic to reach all the gear he needed on stage... (If you wonder what I mean, look up how he behaves on "Learning to Fly" from either the Pulse or Delicate Sound concert tours)
[1:20:45] Blaizeria: Evening from not so sunny Scotland 6:23pm dark and raining
[1:21:06] azumeraa: @DoctorOgenki can we like have a Flabby co-op with that? like he explains it to you, you explain it to us? hehehe you explain in such a nice way, 100% stupid proof
[1:21:19] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 He literally had to jump to reach some of his Taikos...
[1:21:31] Blaizeria: Oh we arena grinding, new season?
[1:22:04] saga_no: Oh wow - I see s-priest is a favored target
[1:22:21] WhippWhapp: Happy Thursday! Go, go PeeveePee @HazelNuttyGames ! <3 LUL PogChamp
[1:22:34] Unboxinista: that is such a soothing add on voice, what is that?
[1:23:15] cashthb: ret is not as easy to kite as it once was, the lingering hand of freedom is nasty, and their ranged damage is nasty
[1:23:21] InfiniFiasco: hazelWave
[1:24:07] nabilstendardo: hiya... I see what you are up to
[1:25:23] nabilstendardo: not having in-game chat during that probably saved your life
[1:25:55] anker_jym: As a Destro Lock main, I can't imagine how hard it would be to PvP. So many hard casts that can be interrupted
[1:27:05] nabilstendardo: it depends at what rank you are playing, at low rank when they let you free-cast chaos bolts it's really strong
[1:27:17] marbared: marathon match
[1:27:46] Jyster: @anker_jym Thats why you have to work on fake casting. You never want to get interrupted on chaos bolt, but if you fear, or immolate, thats ok. Chaos bolt locks you out of everything
[1:28:07] marbared: Kira providing moral support
[1:28:08] eielwind: wow that was long lol
[1:28:21] wispinthewoods: evening Hazel <3
[1:28:47] cashthb: why don't you jsut get one?
[1:28:51] cashthb: yeah
[1:28:59] Synonymous: can you still get those?
[1:29:24] cashthb: nope
[1:29:33] Quachiri: Afternoon, Hazel and chat. Going to lurk here while I shovel some snow
[1:29:37] Synonymous: sad
[1:31:17] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Ok, just looked up a video of Learning to Fly... and I see what you mean... that's like a wall of drums
[1:31:25] cashthb: btw glacial spike spike not even getting trough a pw:s is pretty depressing, maybe it's a good thing I switched
[1:32:41] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 It should probably be mentioned that the band in question were rather "unlimited" in their spending for live performances...
[1:33:23] GreenArrowed: ruuude
[1:33:42] trivotix: wow, it is -150 rating if you leave
[1:34:05] heldtheline: it seems unfair that you don't get rating if someone leaves; there's probably a reason for it but it seems unfair
[1:34:05] cashthb: wish there was a free short movio on youtube we could watch
[1:34:07] little_c2222: That's how raiding makes me feel
[1:34:39] mediocrity_squared: Does the solo queue group people on rating?
[1:34:40] HolocronCoder: Your wig looks so nice today, Hazel
[1:34:41] saga_no: @cashthb I don't think you asking about it repeatedly is going to make her watch it
[1:35:12] wolfcloudchaser80: @NordicSorcerer Oh, and by the way, I'm now tracking the Sting S4 on MSFS, waiting to see if it goes on sale. Looks like it's a *really* well crafted add-on.
[1:35:37] little_c2222: Get mad!
[1:35:40] witchhobbit: hazelLurk
[1:35:56] NordicSorcerer: @wolfcloudchaser80 It is. It's sufficently well crafted that the manufacturer of the real plane advertises it...
[1:36:02] anker_jym: Now what if they introduce PvP to Animal Crossing
[1:36:03] little_c2222: FortBush
[1:36:17] saga_no: Animal Crossing MMA between the villagers
[1:36:22] little_c2222: PokMaskedpika
[1:36:25] saga_no: Would be hilarious
[1:36:40] saga_no: ACFC - we don't talk about it
[1:37:21] cashthb: @saga_no and I don't expect it, me repeatedly asking for it should be funny :(
[1:37:24] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no This would make an awesome Drawfee episode prompt.
[1:38:31] cashthb: atleast you got the vision thingy!
[1:39:02] dastago: just tuned in - loving the cat falling asleep next to you haha
[1:39:53] saga_no: Go on.... silly stories are the best stories
[1:40:04] little_c2222: Nice
[1:40:11] Jokervenom1978: Its the little things.
[1:40:22] gronthrain: BAM
[1:40:41] saga_no: Honestly, that is why I shop for sweats in the Men's department - to get them long enough for my liking
[1:41:38] saga_no: I'm also a huge fan of "Sweater Paws" though, so I love it when sweaters and tops have long enough sleeves for that
[1:43:13] saga_no: brb
[1:46:37] Hippwn: is the season ending soon or something?
[1:46:39] azumeraa: to be fair, it's crazy you are still playing the season. most people quit because they want to keep their sanity
[1:46:52] Nickystr1x: i was on the grind with rdruid but i felt like i was just playing kitten heal simulator while my dps ran in to die and didnt stop any cc on me
[1:47:08] Nickystr1x: swapped to rsham and ive felt much more in control of my fate
[1:47:34] mockspiral: the grind is easiest between 1200-1600 rating, make an alt :3 or rbg
[1:48:13] azumeraa: @Nickystr1x same, solo shuffle is not a good experience as a healer. makes me feel so powerless, like I have no impact on the game
[1:49:00] Blaizeria: Is diminishing returns no longer a thing your getting chain stunned constantly
[1:51:33] lastround: alt z
[1:51:34] anker_jym: Speaking of taping, who remembers good ol DVR?
[1:51:39] Nickystr1x: cant tunnel on frames if u just close the ui *bigbrain*
[1:52:47] cashthb: maybe that was a sign. you know how in martial arts movies the protagonist often does blind training? maybe you should play with your ui off?
[1:52:48] Blaizeria: 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
[1:53:10] saga_no: .....aaand back
[1:53:25] nabilstendardo: UI off healer LUL
[1:53:26] Nickystr1x: whenever im doing keys as an overpowered tank i try to see how long i can play no ui
[1:53:38] Nickystr1x: i did a whole +16 as blood dk s4 shadowlands
[1:53:44] NordicSorcerer: @saga_no So ... I should continue my quest for bodies with thumbhole sleeves? ;)
[1:54:06] nabilstendardo: @Nickystr1x what about no ui + first person
[1:54:09] mockspiral: gg!
[1:54:14] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer Yes and no - sometimes I want sweater paws like the dress I'm wearing has :) (no thumb hole - just sleeve)
[1:54:51] Nickystr1x: @nabilstendardo i've done each individually bot not both. next challenge lined up!
[1:55:45] nabilstendardo: real challenge is doing it with no keybinds or action bars, only by typing "/cast <spell name>"
[1:58:07] Kaseyfullofjoy: Big mood. I also need a hot water bottle
[1:58:14] Blaizeria: Boop the kitty
[1:58:25] cashthb: maybe you should cool some water instead
[1:58:47] heldtheline: you did again lol
[1:58:59] Kaseyfullofjoy: It's not boring I honestly have you on while I'm getting ready bc you are pleasant to listen to!
[1:59:06] cashthb: take a plunge in the coolest bath you can, you won't be so cool in the room after that!
[1:59:10] heldtheline: Azerothian Archives, you mean?
[1:59:16] anker_jym: Archivist's Codex?? You mean from SL?
[1:59:19] marbared: do you do 2s with Flappy?
[2:00:04] Erik046: lets have a bigger screen
[2:01:31] shaypressplay: I have a usb handwarmer I got off amazon and l adore that thing. My hands get cold often.
[2:01:34] marbared: I watched your 1st Palworld stream and that just looks way too addictive. Dangerous.
[2:02:15] anker_jym: Aw, that annoyed meow lol
[2:02:36] saga_no: What about fingerless "gloves" though? Like wrist-warmers?
[2:02:49] themaykr_: meanwhile i always have a fan on near me, even in winter
[2:03:20] Blaizeria: Or put em under the kitty
[2:03:38] zannuss: I think the ac has been turned off maybe twice this winter for me, otherwise ac on and fans going
[2:03:47] GreenArrowed: always here to champion heated blankets and all things related
[2:03:58] GreenArrowed: i got an under desk foot warmer
[2:04:03] Parazetamol91: water?
[2:04:08] saga_no: They take some getting used to, but for me at least they do help a little with poor circulation in the hands and fingers
[2:04:08] Parazetamol91: like ic?
[2:04:48] anker_jym: Hazel lizard person confirmed
[2:05:18] zannuss: Was 88 out 2 days ago
[2:05:28] zannuss: south florida problems
[2:06:16] saga_no: Both Nordic and I are colder than average and do best in ~18-20C; anything too cold or too warm messes with our bodies
[2:06:20] zannuss: hey we are still considered people, not wild life
[2:06:38] Ujai321: Not the reptiles?
[2:07:17] Katyger: I have this whole outfit for sitting at my desk, especially in the winter: fuzzy blanket wrapped around my legs and feet, warm fuzzy jacket thing on...  My desk is also in the basement..  and I'm also in northern MN...  lol
[2:07:26] marbared: “it’s raining iguanas!” - Florida man
[2:07:35] dicemeister23: do you know if you have a shot at research under fire mount more than once per day?
[2:07:37] saga_no: Not gonna lie - the feeling of sitting in a flimsy little boat somewhere in the Florida swamps while gators are swimming around it is ...interesting
[2:07:42] wolfcloudchaser80: An alligator has its own way of connecting. Followed by a death roll.
[2:07:57] zannuss: I mean they do fall out of the tree when it randomly gets into the 50s
[2:08:00] Ujai321: What games do streamer blankets usually play?
[2:08:24] saga_no: Someone get Joe Exotic on the horn - new viral series idea
[2:08:27] saga_no: GATORS.
[2:08:34] little_c2222: Betty white had a pet gator
[2:08:41] Ujai321: Ah, so pretty broad, then
[2:08:56] Kubwa7: how very "betty white" of her
[2:08:57] wolfcloudchaser80: Have you ever heard baby gator/crocodile vocalizations? They're adorable. They sound like someone doing "pew pew" laser sounds.
[2:09:03] little_c2222: Hehe in lake placid movie
[2:09:23] Ujai321: Are you not into fish keeping anymore?
[2:09:34] saga_no: I was offered to hold a gator. By letting it bite my finger and holding its tail. ...I was warned that I MUST NOT let go of the tail, because it would most definitely deathroll my finger off. I declined...
[2:09:47] Ujai321: I remember rooting for the gator in Hook
[2:09:54] zannuss: I'd decline that also
[2:10:17] ivashkov92: Are you judging the dude with the three legged gator? 🐊
[2:10:19] ivashkov92: haha
[2:10:20] Ujai321: A big fishsation
[2:10:29] saga_no: The guy at the gator farm offering was holding a baby gator that exact way right in front of me... so evidently that is a way to do it
[2:10:32] saga_no: Still a nah from me
[2:10:39] anker_jym: You consumed the content, but hopefully you didn't consume the fish
[2:10:43] ivashkov92: Oh that’s fair
[2:11:31] dicemeister23: "Yeahhh..." says the pescatarian lol
[2:11:36] anker_jym: On that same note, you said you're pescatarian right.
[2:11:51] zannuss: Back up food supply
[2:12:04] dicemeister23: Do you like sushi?
[2:12:21] cashthb: might have asked before but would you eat a platypus?
[2:12:43] cashthb: a whale?
[2:12:45] saga_no: True. Carbs = <3
[2:12:52] Catastrophic37: Arenas?
[2:13:04] Kubwa7: would you, would you, in a box?  would you, would you, with a fox?
[2:13:16] cashthb: a mermaid? (female at the top one)
[2:13:26] mcxoney: whats your favorite animal?
[2:13:28] little_c2222: When I was in elementary school , there was a student that used to eat a classroom pet gold fish when the teacher wasn't looking.
[2:13:41] anker_jym: Never seem a whale, but I did see a school of dolphins on my cruise
[2:13:47] themaykr_: capybaras!
[2:13:56] Perkolate: Havarti?
[2:14:16] kynlaeh: hazel would you ever consider a whale watching cruise
[2:14:17] themaykr_: @HazelNuttyGames do you like capybaras?
[2:14:18] saga_no: WHen our neighbor from the US came to visit (in Norway) - she fulfilled a "naughty bucket list" item one night as we had whale for dinner LUL
[2:14:50] saga_no: She was baffled by the concept when she saw it at the store, so we offered her the experience of actually having it
[2:15:31] saga_no: (She also had reindeer, so - like.... her "naughty bucket list" expanded that day)
[2:16:33] Thaxorin: came to say hi
[2:16:46] Thaxorin: what addon is "bam"
[2:16:54] dicemeister23: do you like squirrels or was that more to define a persona for streaming? I'm not judging just a pure question
[2:17:00] Thaxorin: lol
[2:17:01] cashthb: @saga_no this came off the wrong... or maybe i'm just a sick nasty word
[2:17:21] Thaxorin: I was just in Florida and saw crocidiles
[2:17:25] zannuss: There is a capybara cafe in Japan that you can pet them at
[2:17:26] saga_no: @cashthb To most Americans, eating whale is "naughty" - and that was what she called it
[2:17:36] anker_jym: As the matron saint of the Squirrel Squad, I would hope you like squirrels lol
[2:17:53] Thaxorin: love the serious face :)
[2:18:06] ahnn112: i wish the hero talents were all released so i can plan what to play next expac
[2:18:41] zannuss: You got awhile to figure that out
[2:18:48] cashthb: @saga_no yeah but like.. that would be the first thing that comes to your mind when some1 says "naughty bucket list"?
[2:19:18] saga_no: @cashthb This perceived as "naughty" depending on the person; in this case - consuming whale and Rudolf.
[2:20:14] saga_no: Things*
[2:22:29] cashthb: well, no dupes, friendly nameplates shouldn't confuse you
[2:23:20] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm trying to think of exotic local dishes I'd like to try when traveling, but nothing comes to mind. Just the authentic versions of things that are common over here, like curry or sushi.
[2:24:07] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 When travelling here you mean? Well, I could suggest a few :)
[2:25:01] cashthb: @wolfcloudchaser80 what about baklava?
[2:25:06] cashthb: I want some baklava :(
[2:25:25] birdmanburr: Cheer1
[2:25:25] Streamlabs: * birdmanburr has donated 1 bits!
[2:25:48] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no We might take you up on that someday! I still don't know where our first trip to Europe will take us, but that cruise looked promising.
[2:26:07] cashthb: it's more of a sugar syrup with some pastry in it than a pastry I'd argue
[2:26:35] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 You know where to find me when you'd want suggestions :)
[2:26:36] GreenArrowed: bagels
[2:26:38] wolfcloudchaser80: @cashthb That would kinda fit into the "things we have here, but it's more authentic there" list. I'd definitely want some, though.
[2:26:51] anker_jym: I'm in Utah, all we have is Fry Sauce
[2:26:54] endless_pastrami: went to ZM on my warlock and killed big sandbois until the sword dropped and now my felguard has the coolest weapon mog in the neighborhood
[2:26:57] saga_no: Norway in general - Brunost (Brown cheese)
[2:26:58] 7thSaga: prob the cheeseburgers and fries LUL we are a small town
[2:26:58] silenttoxin: have you ever tried a shawarma?
[2:27:01] leefloww: california has so much good food
[2:27:02] Cattddad: toast with butter and some cheese soices
[2:27:09] cashthb: nothing, not a fan of "local" local food, it's pretty multy cultural down here tho
[2:27:23] thegrreatzzz: hi hazel is there still a cap for follower dungeon
[2:27:30] Raineve: so lowkey my friends dad owns a pizza place and their calzone is A-MEI-ZING! It's fully handmade and the dipping sauce is fresh.
[2:27:32] leefloww: shawarma is sooo goood
[2:27:36] birdmanburr: your voice is very easy to listen too.
[2:27:39] leefloww: with some spicy hummus
[2:27:44] BearBot1: helloooo
[2:27:53] saga_no: As for actual "local" food... the best food places in town are run by a Romanian guy, a Pakistani guy, and a Chinese/Vietnamese couple... sooo..... yeah
[2:28:05] ZavhenGhorr: The one Mom and pop shop here did a twist on Carne Asada Fries and did it with Tater Tots and OMG they were amazing, they would Also do it with Chorizo and it was so good too
[2:28:14] silenttoxin: yea I'm from India and i regulary eat shawarmas. They're nice
[2:28:16] MysteriousMind: Käsespätzle - a type of soft egg noodle with different types of melty cheese and fried onions, yummy!
[2:28:17] cashthb: actually cottage chese balls are pretty good, but that might be more of a slavic thing
[2:28:30] fallingupwards: I hate solo shuffles. I always get dps who don't have enough burst to literally kill anything lol
[2:28:49] little_c2222: The npcs in follower dungeons need to critique how we did.
[2:28:58] birdmanburr: Cheer44
[2:28:58] Streamlabs: birdmanburr has donated 44 bits!
[2:29:01] ivashkov92: I dislike cottage cheese 😝
[2:29:10] BearBot1: we re practicing
[2:29:37] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Much like here! When we lived in California, we regularly got food from a place run by a Thai couple.
[2:29:49] saga_no: It's hard to go wrong with a Michelin-level chef in a restaurant set up like a diner/pub with diner/pub prices
[2:30:09] birdmanburr: vinelleShy
[2:30:16] birdmanburr: hazelWave
[2:30:25] Ryok: hmm i guess the only thing you could consider local (if you count pretty much all of germany as local) would be the combination of bratwurst, rotkohl (red cabbage) and mashed potatos xD pretty much my favorite homemade food
[2:30:35] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 The irony is that both the Romanian guy's restaurant and the Asian couple's place also does Norwegian food REALLY well LUL
[2:30:46] cashthb: it's just heritage
[2:30:49] cashthb: yeah
[2:30:54] wolfcloudchaser80: That's the only thing we really miss about Southern California. The variety of food.
[2:31:14] ivashkov92: Brawts are so yummy 🤤 with beer too
[2:31:16] ivashkov92: lol
[2:32:12] saga_no: I honestly love the fact that our local burger/kebab place (Pakistani guy's takeaway place) knows my order by heart, so I can just say "today I'd like burger/kebab, please" and have it made exactly the way I like it
[2:32:23] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no So what's the general theme of Norwegian cuisine? Only thing I could guess at is lots of seafood.
[2:32:24] Ryok: earlier i saw a diner kinda place that also doubled as tattoo shop xD like it was across 3 rooms 2 of which were diner and the 3rd one was a tattoo place xD it was called Pottato
[2:33:04] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 It varies A LOT with where in the country you are; way up north and on the coast it's more seafood-heavy; in the inland areas it's more meat'n'potatoes kind of food
[2:33:43] saga_no: The west country will usually have more mutton, inland and east will lean more towards pork and beef
[2:34:09] cashthb: you might be over thingking it, have you tried just not getting hit by the cleave?
[2:34:13] ivashkov92: @hazelnuttygames or chat, is windwalker good for PvP?? I wanna work towards vicious mount farms
[2:34:41] mishato: windwalker is pretty good, plus its fun
[2:35:57] cashthb: really cool!
[2:36:01] ivashkov92: Cool 😎
[2:36:04] zannuss: OMG. I just got the Shackled Urzul mount from antorus
[2:36:26] ivashkov92: congrags
[2:36:35] ivashkov92: Congrats* 😆
[2:36:51] zannuss: I need the red polearm still, but yeah it feels good
[2:36:53] little_c2222: How many pulls did it take?
[2:37:07] Perkolate: I had a friend who played on that server. onlyone i knew from there haha
[2:37:08] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I sent ya a link on discord :)
[2:37:33] azumeraa: @zannuss congrats! I swear they secretly increased the drop rate of it tho, I've seen so many people getting in the past 2-3 months including me with only ~40ish attempts
[2:37:34] zannuss: No idea, I dont have a tracker, but its been awhile. One of the few farms I do almost every week
[2:37:40] Arabany: Panda-tauren:)
[2:37:45] nashyblaze: Haomarush was among the leaders of the last remnants of the demon-worshipping orcs, all under the rule of Jubei'Thos and the Blackrock clan
[2:38:23] NordicSorcerer: @saga_no Uhm. It goes further. We're on the "just name the animal involved" and he knows what meal you want, and how to customize it for you...
[2:38:25] 7thSaga: just got my Love Language Expoert achieve and got my first cup of coffee of the day And Hazel is streaming this is the life! tasnVIRUS1
[2:38:40] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer True.
[2:39:05] saga_no: "Today I'd like moo, please"
[2:39:13] saga_no: and I get a burger just how I like it
[2:42:15] dicemeister23: anyone know a way to see my highest value pets?
[2:42:17] Thesabreclaw: @HazelNuttyGames I know it's early and lots are subject to change, but how do you feel about Blizz putting more trees in with your trees in the latest druid Hero Talents? LUL hazelPlant
[2:42:21] dicemeister23: I'm 100k from gold scarab mount...
[2:42:21] itsparvati: another day another round of rocket farming
[2:42:21] chat4wheels: I get Arena Anxiety.
[2:42:37] hamiltonforester: hamiltonforester subscribed with Prime. 
[2:42:37] Streamlabs: hamiltonforester just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:42:44] itsparvati: there is a tsm extension for pet values
[2:43:01] itsparvati: it will show values in your journal of cagables
[2:43:08] Blaizeria: Yeah I can't PvP anymore
[2:43:48] dicemeister23: @itsparvati thanks!
[2:44:37] cashthb: maybe it was your turn to leave!
[2:45:15] cashthb: we could also watch the first half of kungfury
[2:45:17] cashthb: just sayin
[2:46:34] Elrathir: rating come and rating go
[2:47:00] silenttoxin: I really wish they let us buy old expansion's elite sets for like massive amount of medals. At least until legion expansion or something
[2:47:14] GreenArrowed: ooo
[2:47:53] cashthb: who eats warm yoghurt DansGame
[2:48:07] itsparvati: cant take a pvp special award away, they get made
[2:48:13] Saiyori: they are also mounts
[2:48:15] mishato: i wish we could get gladiator mounts reskinned
[2:48:15] itsparvati: mad*
[2:48:16] cashthb: it'd be cooler if you had tho
[2:48:33] Elrathir: yeah but the gladiator skin next season looks sick tho, maybe you do need it
[2:48:46] mishato: that way glads can keep their prestige or rarity but we still get to share in some of the cool stuff
[2:49:22] Elrathir: don't mind me, I'm just being a bad influence
[2:50:29] mishato: i kinda disagree with you, i'm an avid pvper but maybe similar current skill level (i hover around 1800-2400). i appreciate seeing someone make mistakes and be cool about it, most competitive pvpers who stream are multi-glads who play close to perfect and you dont get to see and understand as much
[2:50:44] itsparvati: the old days of needing to have the physcial item to tmog into
[2:51:03] mishato: 1800-2100* for me
[2:51:25] kynlaeh: i wish i had the glorious tyranny
[2:51:55] itsparvati: i remember pets before they could battle too, you needed to carry the cage with you
[2:52:20] Elrathir: I'd love to have the Shadowflame illusion form last season, to put on the Fyr'alath I also don't have
[2:52:31] Elrathir: from*
[2:53:06] anker_jym: Ugh, remember keeping all your Transmog in the bank and Void storage?
[2:53:34] anker_jym: @itsparvati ooos, just saw this, you already mentioned it
[2:54:06] Alastree: Hello Hazel
[2:55:20] itsparvati: there is still things in my void storage
[2:55:25] khaobz: did you get your pvp snial yet
[2:55:29] comemorning: hello
[2:55:44] khaobz: oh i didnt do it lol
[2:55:55] little_c2222: When does the season end?
[2:55:57] silenttoxin: owlbear is the new gucci
[2:56:32] silenttoxin: I'm guessing somewhere in march
[2:57:50] cashthb: @little_c2222 at this point... I don't think it will
[2:58:42] itsparvati: i heard druids are going to get a dynamic flightform for next xpac
[2:58:45] havvorthia: you inspired me to try solo shuffle for the first time and i'm only 10% but i actually feel like i can do it and it feels great - and fun :)
[2:58:57] silenttoxin: someone made a video about how long each seasons were and based on the average it was somewhere in March, but yea it could drag till april
[2:59:00] havvorthia: 10% into the mount progress i should clarify lmao!
[2:59:49] itsparvati: how long this season is depends on how soon xpac is i think, they won't leave us in fated season for toooo long
[2:59:52] silenttoxin: lol
[3:00:11] silenttoxin: whats fated btw
[3:00:24] itsparvati: its more for raids
[3:00:33] itsparvati: its the season of prepatch basically
[3:00:54] silenttoxin: Ohh sounds cool though
[3:01:01] silenttoxin: but what do i knw, im a pvp andy
[3:01:24] cashthb: they *said* they added affixes, I didn't see them!
[3:01:27] vharakh_17: im anticipating a "Draconic" affix maybe? i dont think its been announced but would be cool
[3:02:02] cashthb: actually, there was one I always spell stole... it might have done raid damage around me... I helped the healers parse
[3:05:17] 인터넷포트: Have you run into a toxic team mate yet that said something rude to you in solo shuffle?
[3:05:33] vharakh_17: MMR went down by 10 though :((
[3:05:55] cashthb: want me to be toxic in this chat to emulta the experience?
[3:05:59] silenttoxin: I have run into a toxic shaman once who was losing all rounds so he just unequipped everything and danced in the middle on round 6 lol
[3:06:07] 인터넷포트: yeah its funny did u say u are going for a mount from shuffle?
[3:06:13] cashthb: I might take a while copy pasting the cyrilic stuff
[3:06:14] Perkolate: i've had many visions of that instance
[3:06:34] cashthb: why are thinking about banning me?!
[3:06:38] cashthb: I'm offended!
[3:07:00] GreenArrowed: andie
[3:07:04] havvorthia: take care, thanks for the stream!  tneMovEviHeartEyes
[3:07:06] cashthb: andrea?
