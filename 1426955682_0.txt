[0:45:24] Destroyer1v1: Hey towelliee, how are you liking the tier
[0:50:56] The_Metal_Man: if you don't need the brew cd reduction, its better to SCK single target instead of TP
[0:51:11] The_Metal_Man: for bigger dam from more nizauos
[0:51:23] Daggerstry: One day I will see heroic. So far, none of the normal bosses have been hard. But my group can't get past Halondrus
[0:54:10] essadis: oh different vibe. focus mode. what dungeon this?
[0:56:13] The_Metal_Man: yea, but theres a conduot tjat reduces CD of nizuao everytime you shiffle
[0:56:18] The_Metal_Man: conduit that*
[0:56:44] The_Metal_Man: so its higher damage to SCK if it lets you get another cast of nizauo over the course of the fith
[1:00:44] The_Metal_Man: yea sorta depends if you end up getting an extra cast of nizauo or not, but top logs are all doin it

[3:37:08] tabd69: How is ur health after subaton?
[3:37:16] Kaype92: I hit 1336 in Lost Ark and I‚Äôve decided that my best course of action is to just sell all my mats for gold because I don‚Äôt have any desire to watch my honings fail repeatedly with no end
[3:37:33] tabd69: Thats good
[3:39:08] N3llee: as long as Mari's shop contines to be cheaper I will buy my mats from there. Once it stops I stop selling my tradeable mats
[3:39:12] Kaype92: Yeah‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôd keep it anywhere close to where it is now. The Korean players said smilegate eventually increased honing chance and they‚Äôre surprised the buffs never came to NA
[3:39:28] Kaype92: It‚Äôs like smilegate never learned their lesson
[3:39:46] TheGiant99: They also need to make it so Argos gear can be sold in the AH just like every other region
[3:40:04] tabd69: Mailer loot is soubdrrwhelming
[3:40:29] tabd69: Mailer loot is underwhelming
[3:40:42] tabd69: Auto spelling.....
[3:41:12] Kaype92: I think zeals said something about KR got an increased 10% honing chance for 1340-1370
[3:41:22] Kaype92: Or 20 I don‚Äôt remember
[3:43:16] Kaype92: Lots of people leaving the game for now until it gets buffed. Some some in general chat in game saying people are losing motivation because they don‚Äôt want to keep failing just to fight Argos
[3:43:32] TheGiant99: The numbers go donw every day for players playing the game
[3:43:52] TheGiant99: I want this game to be around for awhile
