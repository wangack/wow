[4:15:04] KingMusicalMel: @MlrKNIGHT Sepsis is a poison rot ability that causes the target to take ticks of poison damage for 10 seconds. The 4 piece tier set causes a rogues bleeds and poisons to work 40% harder and the duration 100% faster. Rogues have an ability called Shiv. When combined with the rogue pvp talent Hemotoxin, targets recieve 40% less healing for 9 seconds. So put it all together, that's why Sepsis is deadly.
