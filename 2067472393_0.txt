[1:34:20] feodred10: SP has the best overall tool kit imo, heals, dmg, utility, etc. Melee Hunt is just best Melee dmg / class. Arcane Mage may almost be a meme but they still have the strongest offensive cd in the game with arcane surge. Ele Sham have the most capability to constantly 1shot anything in the game with Lava Burst overload’s + EM Chain Lightning into Earth Shock, plus they get a freedom that’s supposed to be group-wide. Oh and can toss heals when needed
