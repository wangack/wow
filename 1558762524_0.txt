[0:14:15] freetherocktv: old superman movies were good, but the new ones I was not a fan of

[1:07:50] Beet4: 100% staged, I was just thrown an error when I tried to vote on the EU forums. Tried for weeks.
[1:07:50] vadder_fister: trains tho
[1:07:51] ShockASU: Difficult part of ID is just the beginning trash. Once through that it's a cakewalk

[1:08:42] abracka_: how can anyone be that geared already? the answer is sweat
[1:08:47] Teldrin89: that's why I would like to see m+ changed - increase in diff with levels but remove timer

[1:09:37] Beet4: woah, cool!
[1:09:37] Ebo1337_PBP: M=- is for the challenge - why remove that.  Buff them to make them harder
[1:09:44] Cakeabsorber: Chaotic neutral wanting to have the m+ buffed KEKW

[1:15:54] Wolfenhoof: In the golden bubble they've put themselve everything is nice and fluffy. They don't have to go out there in the nasty world.
[1:15:55] Racwo: how do you make those friends though?
[1:15:57] Racwo: lmao
[1:16:13] MetallicusGaming: Just give RDF and remove the teleportation function? Would've most likely been easier/faster then revamping or making a new lfg tool
[1:16:24] Ebo1337_PBP: @Racwo Wow is not about making friends anymore
[1:16:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no lfd until icc
[1:16:43] nixter93: at the very least why didnt they just use the retail LFG tool instead of the new scuffed one..
[1:16:55] Racwo: @Racwo but it should be that's the problem
[1:16:55] PokerFaceMoose: i can make friends in a random dungeon finder just as easily
[1:16:56] matching_towels: Usually takes someone to be like, jump in discord for this m+, that’s how I met a group i run with at times
[1:17:01] PatchesMcPatch: @Racwo thats sad
[1:17:01] noewon: dungeon finder was how i leveled back in wrath.
[1:17:04] Ebo1337_PBP: WoW is anti-social since the whole LFR
[1:17:06] Zippaya: is there a word about allowing us use all gathering professions beside main crafting one?
[1:17:08] Happyjunkie: I still game with people i met in wotlk original dungeon finder
[1:17:11] Cakeabsorber: @Racwo Just talk about shit that you like and bond with randos over it
[1:17:22] Racwo: @Racwo exactly that's my point.
[1:17:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: its just going to be hundreds of people in the system just so they can be in the LFG channel
[1:17:35] Cakeabsorber: @Racwo Everyone's a stranger until you conversate just like IRL
[1:17:43] ItsGigg: IF they make it less convenient then it takes you longer to blow through their 15 year old game thats been optimized to hell. Which means more sub time
[1:17:51] hateful88: Dude it’s that boomer female lead who looks like she’s 90
[1:17:59] Racwo: @Racwo exactly. how ive made friends in wow is usually dungeons etc. at least classic
[1:18:14] Cakeabsorber: @Racwo Got my best friend of many years talking about kebab KEKW
[1:18:21] Ebo1337_PBP: @Racwo but the only things you see typed in chat anymore is criticism - from what I see
[1:18:23] sshadeh: classic is just not the same, people have played the game and know all the shit
[1:18:25] the_bad_goat: Instead of just people spamming constant LFM etc, we will have our dungeon finder
[1:18:27] theviperleet: @Towelliee Nice HP pool

[1:18:56] llNoTToXiCll: sorry had to share
[1:19:07] Cakeabsorber: YEP
[1:19:15] PatchesMcPatch: @sshadeh its not that. people are more juvenile. OG classic was chuck norris jokes, now trade chat is pure vitriol and ego
[1:19:25] Lostdogal: played some BC yesterday, chat in classic is basically just trolls posting about body types.
[1:19:34] Zomgboy: yeah now ppl pick classes that dont compete with your gear
[1:19:37] Cakeabsorber: I'd rather just quest while waiting for dungeon pop
[1:19:37] Strewgle: blizzard is the epitome of cognitive devolution
[1:19:47] nixter93: dude. the new "ghetto" version is so bad actually.
[1:20:06] nixter93: idk. maybe its just the beta version. well see
[1:20:09] Norbi33: we need dungeon finder.. time is money..

[1:20:41] PatchesMcPatch: TBH id rather the group finder than random finder.  you cant vette for shit gear in random dungeon finder
[1:20:43] Mitune: Heroics are not hard enough to need 30 minutes of setting up a group
[1:20:45] Korupcija_: or maybe because it's so easy people will take anyone
[1:20:50] sshadeh: people doing wotlk heroics pre 70 lvl
[1:20:51] sshadeh: LUL
[1:20:58] sshadeh: or 80
[1:21:00] sshadeh: whatever it was
[1:21:08] HaxzorJimDuggan: i would be fine with heroics needing to group like mythic plus in retail, let normals que for quest completion and leveling
[1:21:11] PokerFaceMoose: @Korupcija_ i wish that was true, but there will be times the non-optimal classes wont be chosen because of that
[1:21:17] Nubz84: it will take long to form the group then it will be to finish
[1:21:17] asmodai4823: you always have the option of making your own group
[1:21:19] flebbooo: KEKW
[1:21:25] Snabido: New player/alt catchup more nightmare than on retail
[1:21:44] belfastcl: what kind of spooky nagrand is this
[1:21:50] Norbi33: they need to make it more friendly.. to ppl insteed they smashing ther head into a wall.. @Towelliee
[1:22:05] sshadeh: @belfastcl spooky sounds nice
[1:22:16] GamingDad77: Typical "Two-Foot" mentality...lol
[1:22:31] Aquadriel: so its desolace in steroids Kappa
[1:22:40] Snabido: Centaur civil war? What is this, Desolace 2.0
[1:22:41] stepdrag: RIP die by the sword for prot warriors. just read the notes
[1:22:57] ashwing_: literally highmountain story LUL

[1:23:18] Jimstur: Good to see you again @Towelliee . How was your time at the Casino? Had some  good fun?
[1:23:32] gearjammor: wait why aren't we pillaging the fuck outta these centaurs?
[1:23:35] ShadoodHD: didnt you have ilvl sync on?
[1:23:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: if they scale up the heroics each raid tier the grouping problem will just get worse for new players each tier
[1:23:44] Wolfenhoof: @GamingDad77 Ofc it was, it had tauren. Everything is better with tauren.
[1:24:10] Pilha390: Our land
[1:24:15] Mitune: and...
[1:24:18] GiraffeHydra_: Yeah but free shit
[1:24:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: we here now, our land
[1:24:22] Mitune: its land KKona
[1:24:24] itsamochatree: Are alliance and the horde on the same page for the xpac or no?
[1:24:27] Beet4: Our land
[1:24:33] TheReam: You think dungeon leveling is the way? Is that because it’s simply faster or does it affect reps?
[1:24:36] Wolfenhoof: As a tauren i say fuck centaurs, all of them!
[1:24:42] Aquadriel: new players, oh you Kappa
[1:24:43] Wcvechten: a Mythic difficulty maybe
[1:24:44] hateful88: But Towelliee RDF will Ruin server identity. How else will we know where to find the best/lowest price boosts, gold, and GDKP’s
[1:24:45] Luxicake: heroic+ towPog
[1:24:47] Snabido: I got it: item level scaling Kappa
[1:24:49] Wcvechten: they could even add in a + system to it!
[1:24:49] jeflag: extra heroic
[1:24:51] Snabido: on mobs
[1:24:51] Recool94: heroic + with timer and a chest at the end ?
[1:24:52] gearjammor: I thought in lore the centaurs were all bloodthirsty baddies
[1:25:03] Norbi33: da heroic + to stronk we cant handle need nerf
[1:25:16] akia03: did they add the rated solo que yet?
[1:25:33] Mitune: or dont worry about all that just make mega servers and move on
[1:25:36] AlphasaurusRexx: @akia03 no
[1:25:38] GamingDad77: If you factor in the time to get in a group...I think just questing will be faster. For the casual players at least.
[1:25:59] Funderik: looks like the wardens owl no?
[1:26:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: for a solo player yeah questing will be faster
[1:26:30] Wolfenhoof: @gearjammor Lore changes in blizzard like Afrasiabi changed his girlfriends.
[1:26:53] GamingDad77: on reddit
[1:27:03] Daarksyde: good morning two-foot!
[1:27:07] Funderik: datamined on icy veins, pinch of salt.

[1:28:24] thebakeriscomingforu: Its weird that Ysera is required. Why can't her daughter take over leading the green dragonflight? lol
[1:28:25] sliproach: malfurion sleeps every other xpac so no one will miss him
[1:28:34] captain_khyzan: so sadge ; ; he is my favorite character
[1:28:37] Wolfenhoof: Good thing is he will wake up, but... well, not for long i suppose, lul.
[1:28:42] captain_khyzan: poor night elfs
[1:28:51] dankmeliodas: One of the most powerful lore characters has been shit on for years and they sunset him
[1:28:52] gearjammor: you either die a hero or live long enough to get shafted by the modern wow writing team
[1:28:59] Blackhaxx: cringe LUL

[1:29:58] dankmeliodas: Such bs writing
[1:29:59] SpyCrabbo: that comment there was right, if he's just chilling in ardenweald it's not that big of a deal
[1:30:00] Jimstur: The lengths Malfurboy goes to to get some Tyranda action, my boy!
[1:30:01] Wolfenhoof: He can play around with Sylvanas in the Maw then.
[1:30:01] Lostdogal: if anyone dies they just take the portal back
[1:30:05] Jollywhompus: I would like to type yes to subscribe to @Towelliee legion raps please
[1:30:09] final_fantasy6: killing major lore characters so steve daniser's mom can become the new bad ass
[1:30:09] spainard15: Slyvannas and Malf about to hook up
[1:30:12] Funderik: we'll see malf again in 157.0
[1:30:12] Exoduc: He joins ursoc in the long slumber
[1:30:27] sliproach: they can have him if they give us ursoc back as well
[1:30:32] Mitune: It clearly shows they have no idea for what they want to do with Malfurion anymore and want to get rid of him
[1:30:35] spainard15: They going to produce some Childern
[1:30:38] Wolfenhoof: The whole SL stuff was just a bad joke. SL never happened.
[1:30:56] Daarksyde: what happened in SL happened in SL
[1:30:56] Lataran: what server are you playing on live
[1:30:59] NickLeonhearth: So Malfurion literally prefers death over being married to tyrande ? Sounds right @Towelliee
[1:31:05] Snabido: Idk, needs more setup for that to happen imo
[1:31:20] ashwing_: Cuz why would we do character development LUL
[1:31:20] GamingDad77: SL is going to be the "go-to" to temporarily get characters out of stroy lore now
[1:31:24] Shaele: Ysera is dead dead
[1:31:40] Tirony: Ysera is bound to Arden, idk how otherwise it can be done
[1:31:45] porowozek: pin from Collector's edition got Ysera :)
[1:31:45] Redpandalol: I mean turalyon and his wife were in different places so it’s not surprising entirely
[1:31:46] BlueBlurPrime: next thing you know we bring back a cleansed deathwing
[1:32:06] Wolfenhoof: I wand Cairne back.
[1:32:10] Wolfenhoof: *want
[1:32:18] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning all! towHAMUP
[1:32:20] Funderik: tbh crazier things have happened in wow and other mmo's it's not that bad considering what they could do instead.
[1:32:20] Snabido: ^ he got dun dirty
[1:32:30] Biguile: Instead of Ysera's daughter taking the charge which was teased in literal BFA, we have to trade malfurion for Ysera, completely washing away her story arc in shadowlands. Man oh man.
[1:33:10] raldrik: How long until I win button?
[1:33:11] krayaal: you think there is going to be another leveling event before dragonflight? or was the 50% xp bonus it
[1:33:13] Funderik: there's also nothing saying that that will actually happen in game.
[1:33:20] xNingg: predictions on new expac being a hit or not?
[1:33:28] dankmeliodas: They need new writers
[1:33:33] gearjammor: I want to believe that text is an outdated idea they changed they're mind on and they use ysera's daughter instead

[1:33:41] Exoduc: Blizz regrets shadowlands too, is all
[1:33:52] Snabido: Bring DW back while we at it
[1:33:53] Sollice: It would be bad. She is an aspect that we know is still around
[1:34:02] Mitune: I mean this IS the expansion to get rid of any of the old major dragons
[1:34:05] Jimstur: @Towelliee are you outleveled/outgeared for these mobs???
[1:34:07] Sollice: So to not include her somehow is weird
[1:34:08] Biorrwolf: Does current Retail format still automatically spit you into BFA content?
[1:34:10] elizondria: they've sort of established that the only way to get new aspects is something that happens every 100ish years
[1:34:17] Exoduc: @Snabido we're fighting murozond so just might ha
[1:34:20] Mecabeast: if malfurions soul is so special can't wait to find out about illidan who acclaims during dh intro that he's also immortal
[1:34:25] dankmeliodas: I care more about way more about Malfurion than Ysera
[1:34:30] AustinOranje: deemoWINK
[1:34:39] Thoreya: @Biorrwolf if ur leveling ur first character on a new account, yes
[1:34:42] elizondria: and the last time we had it for kalec. So unless they want to break that they sort of have to bring ysera back
[1:34:42] Sollice: @Mecabeast Night Eleves are immortal arent they
[1:34:45] Snabido: @Exoduc Bruh KEKW
[1:34:46] Pannekaker: @Towelliee How does Prot pally feel now? Did they fix all or most of the bugged abilities?
[1:34:53] Biorrwolf: @thoreya Ty
[1:34:53] Lucium22: Mythic CN was 226
[1:34:58] Biguile: Night elves stopped being immortal after WC3
[1:34:59] Jimstur: yeah taht needs some tuning... there is no risk at all to fight these new enemies....
[1:35:03] raldrik: thats barely above anima loot
[1:35:05] Sollice: Oh.
[1:35:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: or just play an evoker and wait till prepatch Kappa
[1:35:11] Exoduc: @Snabido ready for barrel rolls? Dw feels players on his right side!
[1:35:12] troeffle: How does prot paladin feel so far ?
[1:35:13] Mecabeast: @sollice thought they lost their immortality during the sundering
[1:35:14] LootFeverTV: i mean they have to make lveling mobs so that one who just finished SL leveling can do it :D
[1:35:15] spencernpp: any guess on classic wow prepatch

[2:44:15] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: KEKW
[2:44:18] Mecabeast: yeah
[2:44:19] Dankind64: it's a "shared space" gacha game
[2:44:19] dewking93: it is a clone of genshin
[2:44:20] Knocx: its pretty good
[2:44:24] xhaven: yep
[2:44:25] Jarlan23: it has two boob sliders
[2:44:25] postman_quest: They only seem to invite a very limited number of EU people
[2:44:32] Barret: new chinese gacha
[2:44:37] gritbarontv: similar to genshi and honkai
[2:44:40] Dankind64: Yep, elements in this one too
[2:44:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Gacha and the word "good" KEKW
[2:44:46] Knocx: only 4 elements
[2:44:55] xhaven: elements but not exactly the same
[2:45:03] strike879: lol even my alt account has alpha
[2:45:11] Jarlan23: i dont know why its getting attention it looks like every other anime weeb game
[2:45:14] sliproach: @Jarlan23 one for each?
[2:45:45] Jarlan23: @sliproach the second one i think is the distance between the boobs from what i heard
[2:45:51] angrywowplayer1337: So is the leaked plot point from data mining true?
[2:46:15] SpyCrabbo: no way of knowing for now
[2:46:21] shagbark_: Machine Gun Kelly revenge?
[2:46:50] SpyCrabbo: malfurion is apparently gonna swap places with ysera to bring her back
[2:47:03] angrywowplayer1337: TLDR, more bad stuff for night elves lol
[2:47:55] angrywowplayer1337: At this point it’s funny, Blizz should have one bad thing happen to them every patch just to watch Nelf RP’ers screech into the void.
[2:48:28] Karn1987: pandatvHey towHi
[2:48:33] GamingDad77: Tyrande will have Illidan to comfort her
[2:49:37] Jarlan23: might as well they havent done shit with malfurion in forever
[2:49:54] GamingDad77: with the way the devs are "taking" the story..will he be though?
[2:50:10] Jarlan23: they should send all the characters they dont use to retire in shadowlands
[2:50:18] Jarlan23: then they can bring em back whenever
[2:50:24] sliproach: @M4ND4LORE sargeras been teachin illian how to use large 'weaponary' Kappa
[2:50:33] Sollice: Illidan will come back for sure and so will Sargeras
[2:50:35] GamingDad77: that's what it seems like they are doing
[2:50:42] reggiepowa: we dont know yet how will the story end, maybe ysera will decline malfurion
[2:51:07] HauntHogan: What's up with this Hitchcock music? I'm waiting for Norman Bates to show up
[2:51:08] Jarlan23: the story will end in the dumbest way possible im sure
[2:51:17] Sollice: Because at this point Illidan is just the jailor for Sargeras. And now we know the Jailor himself was the cause of all of the issues in the game ( lame ) Sargeras may be forgiven as he was manipulated by the dread lords and Jailor
[2:51:53] Biorrwolf: This AFK music is...something else
[2:51:53] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW

[2:51:57] Sollice: Everyone wants to know about the sword....Sargeras is going to come back to remove it thats why they dont talk about it
[2:52:04] SLoPPYALieN: Sargeras redemption arc incoming... LUL
[2:52:09] doomkry: maybe sargeras will "cleansed" in one way and go back to his original titan form
[2:52:16] GamingDad77: Thanos will show up...snap his fingers....reset everything. WoW2  2040
[2:52:31] itsDets: what sword?
[2:52:33] Mr_Pennywise_: lol
[2:52:37] Jarlan23: @GamingDad77 tbh they should do something like that
[2:52:37] Sollice: @AbdarTV Exactly
[2:53:00] Sollice: I dont think Sargeras will be forgiven, but I could see, just like Sylvannas, an chance to redeem some misdeeds
[2:53:13] GamingDad77: the "sword" is the only thing keeping Azeroth from bleeding out.  Pull the sword...start over
[2:53:13] Jarlan23: whoever shall pull the big demonic sword out of the stone shall be named king of azeroth
[2:53:16] sliproach: @M4ND4LORE atleast he pulled out Kappa
[2:53:20] jorgoth: turns out it was in her femoral artery
[2:53:38] Biorrwolf: Sword gets pulled, baby Azeroth gets born via C- section, New Titan gets corrupted
[2:53:54] Sollice: @Biorrwolf Void Lords finally make their move
[2:54:01] Sollice: GALATIC PANADMONIUM
[2:54:02] doomkry: maybe sargeras sword hit some old god stuff on purpose where it landed
[2:54:18] Sollice: @doomkry Thats I think exactly what he was trying to do

[2:54:45] Sollice: Uhh who was it Amunthul could not remove all of the old god roots in Azeroth. He did that once and almost killed her
[2:55:11] sliproach: @Biorrwolf dragon riding 2.0 with space ships
[2:55:12] doomkry: what if when azeroth is born there will be a scar on the model from when the sword hit the planet?
[2:55:14] SLoPPYALieN: @Towelliee Did you boggart all the grass or at least puff puff give to your homies? :D
[2:55:20] jorgoth: This sounds like 28 Days Later music a bit
[2:55:27] Sollice: @doomkry That would be a great idea for continuity
[2:55:29] jorgoth: Did
[2:55:42] mayonaes: This zone looks so nice
[2:55:53] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Azeroth can be born?
[2:56:02] Biorrwolf: @sliproach slip through a slip-space Rupture to an alternate universe. World of Warcraft: Titan
[2:56:06] Sollice: @Peoplewhinetoomuch Azeroth is a titan soul. So eventually yea
[2:56:06] krakenfaces: play grizzly hills, suites that zone way more, much better feels
[2:56:12] GamingDad77: @Peoplewhinetoomuch or RE-born
[2:56:13] jorgoth: the piano bits just before you came back was reminiscent of the 28 Days Later like main song that plays heavily at the end of the film.
[2:56:29] SLoPPYALieN: text behind your UI sucks :(
[2:56:33] Peoplewhinetoomuch: huh i see
[2:56:53] SLoPPYALieN: yeah... it's alpha shit happens :D
[2:57:01] zgag: Regarding the mention of Alpha invites eelier.   Getting into Alpha is going to be very very rare for 99.9% of the player base. There are some casuals/semi hardcore that get through, but most Alpha invites go to content creators/media World first type players.  Beta is the best shot for the others.
[2:57:06] Sollice: It's basically the same thing as the MCU eternals. They send a seed to a planet to grow and feed off the life of the planet. Eventually after a while the new Eternal is grown...The planet gets fucked but that will be an interesting future part of WoW story. What will they do
[2:57:39] PandaTV: PandaTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 106 months! im new

[3:08:24] DiiscoViking: @Towelliee is the only place for the dragon glyphs still in the first zone??

[3:10:38] Valzark: @Towelliee that monk talents were data mined in phase 1

[3:10:57] Beud_: DH talent tree is going to be all conduits, lego, and azerite powers
[3:11:03] OhNoNotAgain: dont give them ideas towel
[3:11:05] Atem___: that and they have no 18 years of history or moves to delve back into for them
[3:11:06] LoseAlotLuke: "you wanna glide"? pay for it
[3:11:08] Brogdan: 1 point for each jump
[3:11:08] im_capy: 1 point to jump, another point to double jump
[3:11:15] Lostdogal: All I want for DH is that between cooldowns it doesn't feel like waving a wet fish around
[3:11:20] hostile2715: NOOOO! They're totally gonna put "double jump" behind a talent!
[3:11:20] doomkry: 1 point for eye beam
[3:11:29] Snabido: You sprout wings and can glide > you may jump again in the air
[3:11:30] sliproach: one point to get to you next skill
[3:12:03] OhNoNotAgain: 1 point to be prepared
[3:12:07] killercondon: I wonder if with all the new talent points MT will be easier
[3:12:12] Sollice: @OhNoNotAgain lol
[3:12:18] Sollice: No way Eye Beam is a talent
[3:12:20] Sollice: NO WAY
[3:12:21] Brogdan: 3 points for eye beam damage, 3 points for eye beam duration, 3 points for eye beam length...
[3:12:30] b_l_i_z_z_y: Glaive Tempest is basically fury of the illidari(artifact weapon ability)
[3:12:34] doomkry: 1 point for metamorphosis
[3:12:43] b_l_i_z_z_y: theyll probably load up on a lot of Llegion legendaries
[3:12:48] b_l_i_z_z_y: im guesing
[3:12:56] Sollice: It has to be its a CORE DH thing
[3:12:59] TheBoogs: Tons of classes have very basic abilities as talents so idk why that would be so outrageous
[3:13:02] b_l_i_z_z_y: those were good at least
[3:13:05] Daarksyde: only glide will be baseline
[3:13:07] Jango_: @Sollice i agree
[3:13:13] whteraven_: hello!
[3:13:18] doomkry: i hope monk gets like a tornado fists of fury, would be kinda cool
[3:13:23] Lostdogal: The Hunt feels great on DH, hopefully that gets added
[3:13:23] HauntHogan: Demonhunter flying
[3:13:28] Biorrwolf: Given DH Demon Gliding!
[3:13:36] Sollice: I believe they confirmed hunt will be in as a talent
[3:13:39] b_l_i_z_z_y: @Lostdogal  it is
[3:13:46] b_l_i_z_z_y: it was the one data mined
[3:13:48] Retpally9329: It bugs me how they called them talent trees but took baseline shit and put it on there
[3:13:50] Lostdogal: nice, happy with that
[3:13:50] PlagueHit: They will add all covenant skills for dh
[3:14:11] Sniqi: All classes have to spend talent points to get baseline abilities, so Eye beam will also be a talent, I guess
[3:14:12] doomkry: they prolly have to fix bugs on trees before raid testing right?
[3:14:35] Thoreya: @doomkry no lol. they prob just need to make sure the raid works

[3:14:54] b_l_i_z_z_y: Theyve known DH is poorly designed all SL
[3:14:56] scramperlive: Is it weird that I both love and hate the idea of the new talent trees?

[3:16:13] amricatt: @scramperlive I'm with you there.
[3:16:15] scramperlive: like i love the idea of choice and the granular control over playstyle, but it feels like they went a step too far and over corrected it to something that might be TOO fine tuned.

[3:33:09] lord_euphi: why would someone play feral, when rogue is better in every way

[3:33:50] selondil: sad. Feral made me play WoW. :/
[3:34:03] Carahail: true
[3:34:03] Shaele: bears were like 2 button tanks since wotlk tbh
[3:34:14] Roaringkittylol: I think WoW holding onto signature abilities and names from the old game is holding design back tbh. Why not just combine Bear tank with feral.

[3:35:47] Chiraakitteh: Bear tanks will complain if they have to dps.... ever
[3:35:50] Einherjarthule: Feral is good, but the problem with feral is furuious bite, 50% + of all dmg , no more bleeding cat
[3:36:09] Norbi33: boring zone..
[3:36:18] Roaringkittylol: At the end of the day... its a cat.... all they do is bite and claw lol.
[3:36:27] zeitgeiz: And when bleeding has been good it’s only due to SR and BT propping it up.

[4:17:56] bllynni6614: How are the two dungeons? Hard to find a streamer doing them with S4
[4:18:04] Autoexeq: The charges on Shield Wall is'nt independent from one another. Shield Block however is I believe
[4:18:12] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  u forgot to accept the options i think
[4:18:22] marshal_smouky: From what I see, it takes 3.5min to recharge instead of 2 and that seems like a bug
[4:18:27] ur_a_trashcan_: pats tonight lets go!
[4:18:48] Rottencoarse: ah ok my bad @Towelliee
[4:18:59] ur_a_trashcan_: lmao
[4:18:59] AlphasaurusRexx: @lollypappins i also didnt say no pve. i said good pve. pvp is very much alive in shadowlands from where im sitting. there are simply more people that pve than pvp.
[4:19:12] Autoexeq: If you double press shield block they will recharge both charges at the same time. Shield WALL don't do that.

[5:52:28] Kneckt: thats bullshit
[5:52:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: @91Niki its a separate site

[5:54:43] spookychefkarolina: @kneckt ahhhh well, ya learn something new everyday lol
[5:54:44] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @Kneckt if you're getting drug tested, no reason to risk using any cbd at all. Period.
[5:54:54] Kneckt: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight ok lol
[5:54:55] vi0lencioax3man: Prediction on launch date?

[6:13:12] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: he sandbags alot @pacific3210

[6:16:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: slootNerd actually you played in wod @Dcarter

[6:18:22] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: dcwHuh @91Niki
[6:18:45] zenkodac: that's a lot of bad luck protection counting gear from dungeons and raids
[6:19:25] Northrad: there hasnt been an expansion without borrowed power sense WOD
[6:19:34] han_saro: Professions are pretty casual since its primarily a solo activity

[6:20:50] Effin_Steffin: i'm a 99 percenter and I do profession shit. because i love goooold Austin Powers
[6:20:51] jaina8675309: @Tia214 me to
[6:20:54] Artenuous: potential with fated raiding is also S tier
[6:21:05] ninpon: Chat, can you be a crafter without having to play dungeons or raid? Or does it drop crafter stuff in pve content?
[6:21:25] tastytictacs: i want the items to upgrade gear to heroic/mythic to be a staple of raiding.
[6:21:27] Vile_: Yeah, people shouldn't expect Fated raiding to be a mainstay throughout an expansion. For the ending? Yes.
[6:21:27] Artenuous: true, true. a man can wish tho
[6:21:41] skrin001: i wish they would make faded raids for all raids. I would love to go back in to ICC
