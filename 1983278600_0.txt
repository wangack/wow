[4:09:56] deathrose55555: !liesofpthoughts
[4:09:56] Nightbot: Lies of P - 8/10 - One of the best non-fromsoft soulslike game made, crisp and satisfying combat/mechanics with a lot of options, great sound effects that goes along with its monstrous enemy design. Flawless in performance, no bugs/crashes or anything at all. Main downsides - the game mostly lacks music and when there is music it loops early and often, most of the voice acting is just passable and game is perhaps a bit on the easy side.
[4:10:01] Gunznrocketz: okey
[4:10:05] howruss: @singsing - you could go with Carn to Thousand Needles, there's quests there for 30+ and nice mobs to just farm.

[13:46:55] PlainWolfie: Can’t say the same about emin tho xdding
[13:46:59] crisbylettuce: caiok250, i couldnt bare cata, everything about the writing and the content just ruined it tbh. the content was pretty meh on difficulty scale, but i also played with a band of hardened world firsters. the whole writing and ANOTHER end of the world ruined it more
[13:47:01] GodEmperorRage: the question I ask myself is, when is sing gonna die for content, is the date set already?
[13:47:26] Thkthkthkthk: When will emin join you guys

[13:48:41] crisbylettuce: Fogged, its obvious that you are already addicted since you are playing on a HC server with epic mount xd
[13:48:43] GodEmperorRage: I did world  explorer before cata, thinking they would remove the achievement when you can just fly everywhere. Man did I feel stupid
[13:48:44] caiok250: @crisbylettuce i see what you mean. I loved everything up until wotlk and was kinda excited for cata, but it really didnt seem great
[13:48:46] crisbylettuce: trolsopol, PepeLaf

[13:52:49] PlainWolfie: Crisbylettuce , you not a m+ or pvper? Feels like these 2 don’t really change much other than what’s op etc
[13:52:51] VylIian: KEK
[13:52:52] caiok250: @crisbylettuce yeah, me neither. Also, back in the day i had plenty of time. Nowadays i can barely play 2 games of dota or cs a day

[13:54:52] PlainWolfie: Crisbylettuce ahh okay you needed more, I pretty much did m+ and pvp both arena and BGs, had regular groups for them that pretty much occupied my time along with mog hunting occasionally
[13:54:52] Volcanotron: WoD had good raids

[13:56:22] PlainWolfie: Crisbylettuce ah right, agreed on that part
[13:56:24] crisbylettuce: PlainWolfie, + crossrealm, there was zero reason to stay together as a guild when you could run m+/mraids on crossrealm

[13:57:27] ceolinrob: nah man wod zones were cool, storyline was nice, raids were great. everything except for garrison was good content, but alas garrisons killed 99% of "MMO" in a so-called MMORPG
