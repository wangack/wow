[10:21:47] corbenic: VaN
[10:21:52] Khazmodan6: @Triangles01 40?!
[10:21:56] storemie: think a mulitshot hit the add the succubus was ccing too
[10:21:59] Khazmodan6: can you have 40 people in a party?
[10:22:05] Khazmodan6: or we have like 8 parties?
[10:22:08] Triangles01: In a raid yes
[10:22:14] crisbylettuce: Khazmodan6, probably dps, because if you stand in shit you die and you're less important than a tank/healer xd
[10:22:15] Khazmodan6: aah i see
[10:22:16] issacar42: a party is max 5, but a raid can have 40 people

[10:23:33] crisbylettuce: Khazmodan6, well in retail tank is kinda braindead, because you have so much selfhealing and defensive cooldowns so healer is kinda hard. but in the older exps tank was more demanding to play imo

[10:24:30] Skwishi: iHeckinLovePuns has rolled a 8
[10:24:32] issacar42: tank in classic is painful, b/c the tank's threat generation is a major bottleneck for dps
[10:24:34] iHeckinLovePuns: docSmash
[10:24:37] crisbylettuce: Khazmodan6, just for a party its 1 tank 1 healer 3 dps
[10:25:17] jovitacky: did they kill the ogre boss yet?
[10:25:24] ix_ol: Did you see the Dota update?
[10:25:29] crisbylettuce: issacar42, thats where furyprot builds came in, not only do they do great dps but their threat building is way higher than a full prot warrior
[10:25:29] Khazmodan6: @crisbylettuce aah yes... anyway thank you for the teaching, Sir!
[10:25:56] jovitacky: @ix_ol DOMEGALULTA also he's waiting for next big patch
[10:26:05] ix_ol: Oh
[10:26:09] yusba: so is furyprot a 60 raid thing?
[10:27:00] crisbylettuce: Khazmodan6, no problem, ive been around in the game since vanilla and have been part of one of the top guilds in the early days
[10:27:04] Holgar94: Singu 37 Pog

[10:27:49] rosvida: i wanna play now but i dont wanna die
[10:27:51] yusba: i check recent DOMEGALULTA patch noites, and idk, people make big deal about this? looks such a minor patch

[10:28:52] RinD41: DIDSOMEONESAYMEOW
[10:28:54] crisbylettuce: issacar42, well you kinda need to know when you can play greedy ie stay in zerker stance and pump numbers to maintain threat and when you switch to sword and board
