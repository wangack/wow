[0:21:19] SonofHorus82: I think that this, the Invincible music, and Boralus are the best. With the Grizzly Hills music, it's not just that it's super cozy, but that low viola and finger/bow movements to get it to happen are extraordinary.

[0:53:10] MrKray2: Last time I was hear you said it would be coming back soon but that was a few weeks ago. Just worried if something happened. Glad you ok
[0:53:45] Kinghorn: oh man twitch is adding a social credit score to twitch streamers kelpLUL
[0:53:45] indiana__cones: Prot warriors have to put in so much more work in comparrison to most other tanks, and for very little gain
[0:54:05] SageRuskiy: No?
[0:54:07] raldrik: @fattmike They could more easily highlight the lifts and through artwork they could show it. Better light/dark contrast on the map.
[0:54:07] Beatchimp: towDerp
[0:54:14] SageRuskiy: I mean compared to VDH maybe
[0:54:24] ZakuzaGB: ive always said get rid of IP and they tried in BFA alpha/beta so they must know its garbage
[0:54:31] Jarlan23: meanwhile bears can walk their furry butts up to a pack of mobs and spam thrash with their legendary
[0:54:31] SageRuskiy: But warr isn‚Äôt that much weaker than others

[1:01:33] jerexify: I'd like to have KSM, but I'm happy with KSC.
[1:01:35] tmas84: you have to have new loot to upgrade too
[1:01:40] Ishva: what really sucks if you get something sexy out of the vault today and its not upgradeable :(
[1:01:42] Populatre: you cant upgrade gear you had prior to the patch though it has to be gear looted after patch drops

[1:18:04] SonofHorus82: my order yesterday was fazeberry, tropical rain, and peach rings. Haven't had the peach rings yet so hopefully I enjoy it.
[1:18:05] SageRuskiy: It‚Äôs healthier technically than like monster energy @keeindordel
[1:18:05] elijuhxx: What does Gfuel actually do for you? is it basically an energy drink?
[1:18:08] ZakuzaGB: i remember being addicted tie fazeberry when gfuel first started but i never bought them again
[1:18:09] MoeScams: ok bro you sold me, i'll hit the peach rings

[1:18:40] Cyberl0c0: @Towelliee normally a Monster drinker, but I ordered some Gfuel to try and to help u out!
[1:18:41] Swertson: This is EU or NA?
[1:18:52] keeindordel: @sage_ruskiy so I've only been buying the ready to drink cans, but are the powders the same thing?
[1:19:00] jamarky23: No i kinda regret buying three tubs of hypersace, tropical rain and faze berry sour. Should taken peach rings instead of faze sour
[1:19:25] kamisengames: HAMMER SHAKER!!!!
[1:19:33] griffdog125: I've got a 32oz Gatorade bottle I fill with 2 scopes of peach rings everyday.  drive truck all day and keeps me going
[1:19:35] SageRuskiy: @cyberl0c0 as a fellow unhealthy caffeine can enjoyer, Gfuel is a nice alternative for a bit but its a powder so it‚Äôs not really the same tasting as a carbonated drink
[1:19:35] Ahloren: yeah I want me a shaker

[1:20:37] SageRuskiy: @keeindordel it has no sugar, sweetened with some thing I forgot the name of , and it‚Äôs less caffeine per serving
[1:21:09] shimwood: I doubt it's more than 50 per dungeon
[1:21:09] SageRuskiy: It‚Äôs not exactly fruit juice or water in terms of healthy but if u like caffeine and sweet drinks it‚Äôs better than monster
[1:21:10] Federaldemon: It better be atleast 500 for a 15 :)
[1:21:11] fistofnature: how many hours till NA reset?
[1:21:13] Creative_Pigeon: won't the 220 be Account wide from your KSM?

[1:23:32] Kinghorn: it will be capped at the start of a season probably
[1:23:45] Ertra: @Volly of course you can, even if it only drops 30 per M+... you know there's people thats going to farm it

[1:24:52] Crowargus: chat any insight to what the top dps spec will be with patch think it might be fotm time lol
[1:24:59] Avaleria: @Towelliee Why don't your raid GV rewards scale like Mythic + does? If you clear Heroic you only get 213 from the vault, but if you do Mythic + you get a big IL increase.
[1:25:03] SageRuskiy: They literally changed this yesterday @federaldemon
[1:25:10] luckfore: to the forums! towRee towRee

[1:25:36] fistofnature: @Avaleria yeah but not as much as mythic
[1:25:36] WhiteKnight74648: I'm not even excited for the "patch" and valor system
[1:25:42] MourvinMad: alright mate i finally bought some gfuel going to give it a try...the coffee flavor will at least be similar for me
[1:25:43] SageRuskiy: It‚Äôs around 5 k to fully upgrade a 2 hander to 220
[1:25:58] SageRuskiy: From 187
[1:25:58] Aphro_Samurai: @Towelliee the forums will all be the angry Kermit on a keyboard meme LUL
[1:26:04] Methyd: ah gotcha
[1:26:19] mmrghost7: probably from base he means
[1:26:27] Uutef: the cap still increase by 750 per week, right? it just starts at 5k
[1:26:36] feherlofia123: @uutef no
[1:26:37] Avaleria: @fistofnature I am just saying, if we clear Heroic, shouldn't we have a chance for higher level loot. But i can clear a +10 everyweek, i can get like 220IL GV rewards.
[1:26:38] CardinalTX: They could have a "casual path" to gear upgrades.    Hell just make it take 5-10 times longer
[1:26:40] Theconuk88: So we need SLKSM for that correct? I haven't clearwed 15s in time but I do have 10's I cant find my chievs but I know I did them just curiuou/ Bc I have  KSM fromw ay backl
[1:26:57] Creative_Pigeon: @Theconuk88 yeah it'll be account wide
[1:27:01] Lumimyrsky: @Towelliee Have you tried the French Vanilla iced coffee flavor? I'm looking at it cause it's on sale here, but I've never tried anything from G fuel.
[1:28:08] Theconuk88: Yea but I have myintiial KSM from WAY back, thats what I am saying I can['t find my SL shievs for some reason but know I did them like I said
[1:28:21] Theconuk88: Also I have 2 accounts that register under one email I wodner if it will share between them
[1:28:40] SageRuskiy: @towelliee of course, I understand. Someone in chat asked what the cost to upgrade was and I said the total cost from the lowest Ilevel as base
[1:28:50] Lazugo: I hope they applied the same rules as in 8.3. Valor at the end= key level X 10
[1:28:53] Hybridwarhawk: Can confirm, if you put all those in milk they are bangers; in just water they are blah
[1:29:34] Bobby188: what about mil with the snow cone flavor?

[1:32:48] LSBreed: is Valor pts going to be based on difficulty as well?
[1:32:49] SageRuskiy: Reset has not occured
[1:32:57] Lazugo: In 8.3 works as i said key level X 10 @LSBreed
[1:33:01] SageRuskiy: We do not know @lsbreed
[1:33:02] Scarhearth: Happy to help @Towelliee :)

[1:33:19] ventu105: when is reset over?

[1:34:27] MrTahmm: 400
[1:34:30] Texas_Mizfit: towelliee i have faith phial will be in you vault
[1:34:36] GnomeLickerGames: I only focuse min max after hitting cap otherwise it's so much more work
[1:34:37] Creative_Pigeon: what I mean is like upgrading a blood scale from DoS on my brewmaster and not the haste crit stuff I got out of my vault
[1:34:38] pixel2207: oh and @Towelliee do you know can you up m0 items?
[1:34:46] FischBowlGaming: Can you upgrade PvP gear?

[1:35:18] D3m0nHunt3r666: beautiful day to farm valor and rip keys Kappa
[1:35:32] SageRuskiy: Better than 8.3 where you could get 4 belts in a fucking row
[1:35:37] Korupcija_: @Federaldemon that's why you do 4 or 10 dungeons
[1:35:37] SageRuskiy: Woohooo
[1:35:39] jamarky23: this shit should have never left the game in the first place
[1:35:45] Kinghorn: FeelsBirthdayMan

[1:37:13] mizerboy: @julieloveswow - thanks
[1:37:14] Siraeyou: Huzzah
[1:37:17] SageRuskiy: @siraeyou the actual valor is person bound but the unlock aka KSM is account wide
[1:37:17] Douggi3: Did the reset already happen or is this EU?
[1:37:26] TheGaoSora: oh thank gods they;re learning lol\
[1:37:40] SageRuskiy: Reset has not happened and this is NA
[1:37:45] dylannno1: does ksm work across multiple characters? like i can do 4 on 1 toon and 4 on another
[1:37:50] SageRuskiy: No
[1:37:53] MGTastic: any idea if we'll have to do KSM each season to be able to upgrade?
[1:37:55] SageRuskiy: As far as I know
[1:37:55] byrdeen45: but if you can do 15s you already have 220 gear
[1:38:01] dath1166: What is ksm? Im fairly new lol
[1:38:07] SageRuskiy: Keystone Master
[1:38:13] SageRuskiy: All 15s done in time
[1:38:21] SlippieSlik: You say "ksm"...what does that stand for?
[1:38:21] jerexify: @dylannno1 Yes, you can. Towelliee completed his across his Monk / Paladin.
[1:38:29] Lazugo: @dath1166 time all+15
[1:38:35] Cravoraz: it's good to fill in 1-3 pieces but other than that :P
[1:38:36] SSD511_: Hmm i need to do layer 8 for the mount but I don‚Äôt know if the server shutdown
[1:38:37] GnomeyNick: im 225 and i am still wearing 210 gloves and rings :(
[1:38:41] SonofHorus82: I've not done a single mythic dungeon at all. I wanted to, but my 7 person guild stopped logging on and I'm not an overly big fan of pugs.
[1:38:41] sgt390: can't wait to upgrade my 200il trinkets
[1:38:42] Creative_Pigeon: @byrdeen45 thats not true, people were clearing 15s with 202 ilvl
[1:38:42] Douggi3: @Towelliee Dude Where would you rank prot warrior?
[1:38:48] Marah57: give me 226
[1:38:49] IamWambo_: Yeah I still got a 184 IQD
[1:38:49] suppressibility2: Im gonna get some sick shoulders and trinkets. I have been ksm for over a month now
[1:38:55] Lazugo: @SlippieSlik Keystone master
[1:38:56] IamWambo_: And have ksm
[1:39:01] Korupcija_: do you think cost should be different as you upgrade?
[1:39:03] pixel2207: IDQ will be the most upgraded item ever
[1:39:07] Kinghorn: all I need is the stupid unbound changeling
[1:39:09] SlippieSlik: Ty @lazugo
[1:39:12] Siraeyou: I know I wouldn't mind swapping out my 226 rings with 220 ones with better stats
[1:39:22] TheGaoSora: don't they give mythic for pvping?
[1:39:37] SageRuskiy: Idk man 12 Ilevel is a big loss of primary stat @siraeyou
[1:39:44] okoflux: mythic raid being the source of highest level gear is a good design imo
[1:39:44] Tyrou: so what you do is you upgrade all your gear to 220 then farm pvp fo rthe 226/233 gear
[1:39:47] Kromede: hold my jam IonJam
[1:39:53] SageRuskiy: Unless it‚Äôs dogshit stats currently
[1:39:53] Lazugo: @TheOmniSora And gasps target loot for pvp
[1:40:03] Siraeyou: @sage_ruskiy no primary stats on rings
[1:40:04] magemaster225: the real tears are gonna be when they walk back 226 pvp gear in a later patch
[1:40:04] octnoir: Don't have to have KSM get 226 loot. Push to 18s and get 226
[1:40:04] tonyr23: so to upgrade to 213 gear I just need to do all dungeons on +10
[1:40:06] MilkmanDan92: how many valor points do you get from doing dungeons?
[1:40:08] GnomeyNick: but like M+ only people CAN get 226 gear... sooo why they complaining
[1:40:08] SageRuskiy: Rings don‚Äôt have primaries ignore me I‚Äôm an idiot
[1:40:10] SoulessWar: SoulessWar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:40:12] ZealotryTV: @okoflux only if you want your standard addicts to keep playing
[1:40:16] Texas_Mizfit: all m+ 20s timed should allow you to upgrade items to 226
[1:40:17] Kinghorn: we dont know milkmandan92
[1:40:18] aRustyRanger: I was thinking, how do you even get to 200ilvl PvE as a fresh toon, ive always done pvp
[1:40:28] MilkmanDan92: @Kinghorn oh tyty
[1:40:38] Kinghorn: we just know the amount from callings
[1:40:41] MasterYogg93: @Towelliee upgrade m0 items too?if is poss?
[1:40:43] KPable: got all 3 this week
[1:41:06] okoflux: @ZealotryTV or if you want to give an incentive for guild to try and beat mytthic raid
[1:41:17] reyvin40: well, i'm not going to be able to upgrade any useful gear unless i stop running mythics with my guild.  They aren't very good and stand in everything.  I don't even have all +5 achievement
[1:41:18] CDubTheRIPper: danHmm
[1:41:30] SaDos: @Towelliee if you want a specific item from the vault you have to do that specific dungeon 10 times to increce the chances
[1:41:32] SageRuskiy: @reyvin40 change guilds
[1:41:39] rottisxd: the trophy would be too strong
[1:41:42] TheGaoSora: Sounds like extra step...
[1:41:45] malaano: too OP
[1:41:56] CDubTheRIPper: or use the trophy for a piece of gear you already are wearing
[1:41:57] Foglatch: yeah people would enjoy that
[1:42:06] CDubTheRIPper: yeahh
[1:42:06] Foglatch: so it can't happen
[1:42:07] Kromede: oh oh https://twitter.com/Zorbrix/status/1369295303866806273
[1:42:08] pixel2207: tbh doesnt need to be 1 trophy for upgrade
[1:42:16] pixel2207: they can make it 3 5 10 whatever
[1:42:23] SaDos: if you want a specific item from the vault you have to do that specific dungeon 10 times to increce the chances
[1:42:24] Lazugo: you're late @Kromede
[1:42:33] Syloxanee: can you use valor to upgrade to 226?
[1:42:41] GnomeyNick: not really, coz u can ONLY get the trophy, then the following week you can upgrade a piece.
[1:42:41] SageRuskiy: No
[1:42:47] SageRuskiy: 220 cap @syloxanee
[1:42:48] peinen: the vault needs some refinement, but lets not kid ourselves, it's infinitely better than the chest system from legion and bfa
[1:42:50] Kinghorn: tbc beta kelpEyes a man can dream
[1:42:54] rottisxd: if the trophy would be in place of your 3rd dungeon loot instead of stygia you could do 10 +15s and earn it
[1:42:56] Lazugo: Imagine 9.1 PTR today

[2:46:18] Tyrou: it makes the casuals not want to play lmao
[2:46:18] Simperfit_tv: I got ksm I was 215 ilvl
[2:46:20] The_PatientZero: how are prot warriors going to be with the 10% base increase?
[2:46:21] bodli1125: Feral Druid (C-Tier) Destruction Warlock (C-Tier) Arms Warrior (C-Tier) Demonology Warlock (C-Tier) will have fucking hard time to get m10+
[2:46:22] Kinghorn: casuals dont need 220 gear
[2:46:23] DemonicGrizz: So does this mean that right now I can upgrade my gear to 200 Ilvl with out having any of those achievements
[2:46:23] KingSlayerYotam: so a casual player who maybe did a 5 in time need to do every dungeon at 10 to get gear, ok blizz
[2:46:25] fistofnature: just buy a token Kappa
[2:46:26] gojuc: KSM is easy to get
[2:46:27] LoenBehold: As casual, this does nothing for me lol
[2:46:28] camatronian: I belive Blizzard wants to kill off M+. How M+'ers can upgrade conduits? No 233 weapons., Ilvl cap at 220? Like wtf? Pvp/Raid have all of this covered. They are just trying to piss off M+'ers......
[2:46:29] crashoverride_gaming: So true
[2:46:29] dcorey416: so when is 9.1 going on ptr
[2:46:32] Fleymour: want for +18 = 226 gear for my main Sadge @Towelliee
[2:46:36] Korupcija_: lol 220 for free? no way
[2:46:36] Gipetto: its built for people that revolve their entire life around wow. those that don't work and leave the house
[2:46:38] TheRiwen: they just like us to buy more tokens
[2:46:39] TheGaoSora: LUL
[2:46:40] Reckless_Monk: HAHAH
[2:46:40] Scarhearth: as a casual player... im just now starting to push 15s but my group runs a non meta comp with no lust :P
[2:46:45] jerexify: @maannnyy Maybe for you and your group. Not for everyone.
[2:46:46] balanira: Iits not even good for mythic raiders with 220 ilvl cap
[2:46:49] dphily: im a trash r shaman and KSM has been [retty easy this xpac
[2:46:51] arcanine01: doesn't matter at all lol, gonna take ages to upgrade gear xd
[2:46:54] fallentot: @dcorey416 no one knows yet
[2:46:56] crashoverride_gaming: Which blizzard is supposedly against doing the boosting
[2:46:58] woodnf: @doog45 agreed.  I'll be at 220 just from my vault running 1 +10 a week before I get all dungeon +15 timed runs.
[2:46:58] imthabeast: It‚Äôs built for 9.1 not 9.0.5 it‚Äôs just testing it before 9.1
[2:46:59] Demanisraar: bullshite
[2:47:03] othraerir: like 2 people in my guild have KSM, and we cleared heroic sire
[2:47:03] dwyanewade23: idk why it isnt till 226
[2:47:04] ARROOCE: @Scarhearth Atleast buy drums FailFish

[2:47:11] longdongliam_: i dont think it will go to untimed dungeons, tahts to casual. slap in the dick for good players actually timing the keys
[2:47:12] Kinghorn: @dphily congrats on being a meta spec
[2:47:15] frankiewawa: Im here for the pvp. dungeons are boring lol
[2:47:19] gugaslith3030: lul
[2:47:19] Doog45: @Simperfit_tv not saying it is a must have, but I bet most that grinded it out are 220 by now, if you got carried or bought it of course that is different
[2:47:19] SonofHorus82: Me: "Hey Blizzard, why are you making so the casual player (me) can't really get higher level gear?" Blizz: "Because fuck 'em that's why!"
[2:47:20] bobbycagg: but the 207 can be upgraded.....

[2:47:39] 3663Sharad: Its on pair with the Valor Upgrade LUL
[2:47:39] Simperfit_tv: @Doog45 I have done all of them in pugs :)
[2:47:40] NickLeonhearth: Its a BIG fuck you to the face
[2:47:40] MilkmanDan92: I like that now that you can upgrade the gear.
[2:47:41] jure__: they are making wow into a second job, rather than a game... thats the worst thing
[2:47:43] fear_xdd: 3 pls
[2:47:44] dracullus: correction: one guy get 210, second 197, you get nothing @Towelliee
[2:47:45] JacobBose: AGREED
[2:47:45] DrakeDuude: lol they are min/maxing us lol
[2:47:46] nihilistic_bat: people will still play if there was more loot LUL
[2:47:49] glowjob: i dont agree, if you cant beat it, why do you deserve the gear?
[2:47:50] GenMysters: @Towelliee ? about the achievement. Is it a +5 in all dungeons starting today? Or is it from previous runs?
[2:47:53] Simperfit_tv: @Doog45 and grinded keys lvl each dun'
[2:47:53] crashoverride_gaming: Man people are going to be so fucking elitist now on keys even more than before
[2:47:54] theoriginalzinng: 3 on time 2 on deplete, be done
[2:47:57] Fleymour: 210 loot OMEGALUL
[2:48:03] camarac: pvp players can upgrade their gear with honor which can be infinitely farmed
[2:48:04] Reckless_Monk: making my wallet cry..
[2:48:07] Reklusion: Pointless it just means someone has to spend an exta bit of valor for nothing really xd
[2:48:07] dphily: 210 loot OMEGALUL
[2:48:08] JacobBose: Its legit usuless gear any way unless upgraded.
[2:48:09] draxx_6: I think they forgot that people play games for fun
[2:48:10] Doog45: @Simperfit_tv link it up
[2:48:12] payback_03: towBeer
[2:48:13] ARROOCE: does anyone even need 210 loot anymore? OMEGALUL
[2:48:14] khakifry: @crashoverride_gaming yeah... as if it wasn't bad enough already lol
[2:48:14] bodli1125: well its fucked up as hell casual player or who cant play 24/7 are fucked
[2:48:17] MuttonChopins: Blizzard trying to force players how to play and not hearing their audience it seems
[2:48:24] Simperfit_tv: @Doog45 Simpercham on Raiderio
[2:48:25] anima189: I dont like how stuff drops now. I want it to go back to pre random chance and this boss drops x y or z item
[2:48:25] TheRiwen: just remove m+
[2:48:26] Xirmak: I would rather run BRD for hand of justice repeatedly like in classic/vanilla than this garbage here.... at least I know when something drops its BiS
[2:48:26] Unciatim: Will the vault change affect this weeks vault (last week kills)... @Towelliee
[2:48:28] jerexify: @GenMysters Nope, don't have to restart the achievement. If you have it, or part of it, you're good. Just keep going.
[2:48:33] TheGaoSora: bring back pre sl drop rates..
[2:48:34] LSDwight: imagine needing 210 loot OMEGALUL
[2:48:36] Fleymour: @ARROCEX same for upgrade to 220 ... yuk
[2:48:38] lunchbox8669: i havent received a single piece of dungeon loot from normal or heroics in forever how am i supposed to gear lol
[2:48:39] Redbearded16: I reallyyyy dont like the ilvl reward change
[2:48:42] girlz__: so if u finish the m+ dungeon, do u only get 2 items of the same ilvl? or do u get 3?
[2:48:43] Rizec: this just shows how much they dont understand, they think gearing is fun, but actually having gear is fun
[2:48:51] NILLme: this is a prime example how they are inventing dumb shit just to keep us subbed for longer and please the investors
[2:48:52] GenMysters: @jerexify thanks
[2:48:53] duhworks: @GenMysters if you already did it you're fine I believe
[2:48:55] gargakan: i gonna continue to prepare for tcb
[2:48:55] Javydachamp: is the server really down for 6 hours?
[2:49:10] LoenBehold: Will that go into effect from last weeks raids?
[2:49:12] Xirmak: haha and add time after that
[2:49:16] narthy_poo: @girlz__ A failure drops 2 pieces now instead of 1. 1 of those pieces is a lower ilvl. In time completions are unchanged loot wise
[2:49:18] Gipetto: server not back until 1pst or 4est
[2:49:20] liberategeorge: if all goes well it could be up earlier
[2:49:23] bodli1125: 1500 gold is nice
[2:49:24] othraerir: only 1 potency per spec though
[2:49:29] girlz__: thanks.
[2:49:29] Fleymour: 30% of my potecy already are 226.. ooof
[2:49:31] ARROOCE: PogU
[2:49:31] MuttonChopins: blizzard seem to focus more on philosophy than the game being fun
[2:49:36] Ablackdruid: Thats big
[2:49:37] StateFarm206: Pog
[2:49:37] WhiteKnight74648: VoHiYo 1500 gold VoHiYo

[2:49:40] nihilistic_bat: that was the best thing I read all notes
[2:49:45] magemaster225: let higher ilvl conduits drop in m+ blizz I beg

[2:53:08] Xirmak: BW sucks.....
[2:53:20] Doog45: @Simperfit_tv I see what you are saying, but you aren't very far from 220. Will help you some, but still think upgrades should still go up to 226.
[2:53:22] VictorAvalanche: BW does not suck, you have no idea what you talking bout
[2:53:30] dcmeier9: does it usually take blizz the full amount to get the patch going
[2:53:32] Xirmak: did you try it on PTR
[2:53:43] Allvarez: BW is now BiS for single target right

[2:54:08] partymaniac87: :D
[2:54:09] Simperfit_tv: @Doog45 Yeah I agree, just I don't think it's needed to be 220 for ksm, depends on groups :)
[2:54:10] MuttonChopins: when did BM become BiS thought it was MM
[2:54:13] Xirmak: It is not BiS.... it is improved... not BiS its clunky and STILL not there
[2:54:18] ExtraCrazyFool: so many buffs lol
[2:54:23] Lincoln_WoW: its a havoc legendary

[2:54:58] ocdgamernerd: Rylakstalker's Piercing Fangs was proposed to be 40%
[2:55:11] jure__: serpentstalker is a big ass berf to MM
[2:55:21] oraclespyro: no wonder rystalkers  over soulforge  35 percent is  huge
[2:55:21] honeychonker: That's huge for fire, works out a 3-4% buff overall.
[2:55:22] Doog45: what's the over/under on down time today?
[2:55:24] cruzeal: surv KEKW

[2:56:04] Javydachamp: are there any nerfs for fire mage and ret pallys?
[2:56:12] honeychonker: no fire got a buff
[2:56:24] honeychonker: DC gives a 3-4% overall buff to combust damage
[2:56:25] GenMysters: @Towelliee < has a great radio voice. Should look to do some news casting.
[2:56:26] Javydachamp: why did they buff fire ?!?
[2:56:33] othraerir: i can't wait for the april fools class buffs
[2:56:33] anithics: lol fire getting a buff
[2:56:37] anithics: joke of a game
[2:56:37] Loftineer: did anything get a big nerf ?
[2:56:51] honeychonker: DC was already close to FI, now DC is far ahead, we just cast a frostbolt every 30s now
[2:57:01] ARROOCE: I want tier sets back Sadge
[2:57:01] gojuc: @Loftineer Windwalker monk got the biggest nerf
[2:57:03] Lincoln_WoW: still bad yes
[2:57:07] longdongliam_: fire didnt get buffed
[2:57:13] honeychonker: yes it did
[2:57:14] cruzeal: stormstout is still bis
[2:57:15] toobaked1987: @Towelliee why have you guys not started a bruv WoW podcast? I would listen to you and sloot (insert others) talk about WoW all day.
[2:57:23] honeychonker: the new lego is a 3-4% overall buff to fire
[2:57:25] playitday: frost nova is better cause no cast time :D :D
[2:57:25] Fleymour: @Loftineer thats legendary tuning. they buff all dead legendary . no nerfs in that categorie
[2:57:39] Jacksprat47: generic legendary is a buff to fire
[2:57:41] ZakuzaGB: that sounds good in pve
[2:57:45] Loftineer: @gojuc oh really? i heard MM got nerfed but i need to have a look at notes
[2:57:58] Javydachamp: so these are just the legendarys not nerfs or buffs to the classes itself?
[2:57:59] Lincoln_WoW: yes
[2:58:00] honeychonker: @playitday No its not, you waste a GCD, do less damage and DC buff begins at the END of the cast, so you nova 6s on pre pull but frostbolt mid-combust
[2:58:01] balderz1: The buff to the legendary is nice but they just made the spec not work with the bug fixes
[2:58:05] Lincoln_WoW: still not good
[2:58:05] Jacksprat47: fire now gets 20% crit damage during full comb rather than building to 15%
[2:58:17] SilkeySmooth: AS IF WW MONK WASNT BROKEN ENOUGH
[2:58:27] JMoney_1331: ooo my final verdict got buffed
[2:58:30] gojuc: @Loftineer It was through a fix to 7 year old bugs xD Resultet in 5-7% nerf single target and Aoe/m+ dmg nerfed by 20-25%.
[2:58:45] balderz1: @SilkeySmooth its not broken now
[2:58:46] Demanisraar: not bad
[2:58:55] longdongliam_: DC isnt going to take over FI lol
[2:58:55] DrGosling: @SilkeySmooth u know they nerfed ww through fixing buffs right?
[2:59:06] Lincoln_WoW: only on sire where you need that + spellwrd
[2:59:11] macanudo17: sludgefist?
[2:59:12] honeychonker: @longdongliam_ yes it is
[2:59:19] balderz1: nerfed or made like surival @drgosling
[2:59:30] Loftineer: @gojuc is that monk? dam 20-25% is big

[3:00:07] eziz86: Ret pally buff ?
[3:00:36] longdongliam_: @gojuc Windwalker will still pump, it's not as crazy as people think
[3:00:50] Loftineer: @gojuc that sucks. Ive mainly been running unholy DK and MM. Thinking about making a shadow priest but not sure.
[3:01:02] balderz1: idk losing roughly 25% of AOE damage seems like it hits pretty hard @longdongliam_
[3:01:09] honeychonker: @longdongliam_ almost every single fire mage is changing to DC ring, it's a no brainer. Its a straight up 3-4% buff overall.
[3:01:19] honeychonker: Yes
[3:01:21] drs031: just prot warrior
[3:01:23] brotherzttv: The final verdict buff is actually kinda insane, do you think the sephuz lego is still better?
[3:01:24] toobaked1987: BM HUNTER
[3:01:24] parmesanchi: Arms warrior that arent venthyr are

Uptime is 8 seconds Cooldown is always 40 seconds so on large pulls what good  is shield block for 4 seconds against casters when it blocks mele.  So you know. If you are charging targets within a pack you have your back to one of them and that is bad.  Just my thoughts.

[3:36:35] madmannyyz: can we just join  the classic guild or do we need to apply?
[3:36:37] zs3000: Amen
[3:36:40] TheGaoSora: mmhm
[3:36:40] SilkeySmooth: the catch up mechanics are bad right now
[3:36:41] kokochris: Agree,
[3:36:41] snaksy: I agree
[3:36:43] mhgamerkid1337: im back
[3:36:44] Mathhbm: agree
[3:36:44] BodyshotsAllDay: KSM should get you something but yea agree
[3:36:45] laeenaravenholdt: @TBBEX_ I get to the same point and do the same. So, I just create another alt. lol
[3:36:46] bouv44: yep I agree
[3:36:48] mhgamerkid1337: omg
[3:36:49] stigmagamez: Not true at all, there needs to be some sort of player skill required.
[3:36:49] ZiggyJZ_: JZiggys subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[3:36:49] OG_Kawngi: ye
[3:36:49] foxies_havocing: @bodli1125 yes, but still, without group and pugging all
[3:36:51] tbbex_: I'd rather get less valor with no ksm than have ksm with more valor
[3:36:52] Aakku: most of my friends had to wait a week just looking for the right key or pug it
[3:36:52] slugrite: 210gs with no raid or myth. broken system. top G's is 230.6
[3:36:53] pvtpilot88: been trying for weeks to get ksm for the mount and pug groups are rough to get keys timed.
[3:36:54] kaelanDori: agreee
[3:36:54] sussyrev: hard no on your idea
[3:36:55] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:36:55] wetttnine: Yes
[3:36:55] yggy: sbt
[3:36:57] dimofodi: @BodyshotsAllDay KSM gets you a mount
[3:36:58] DrakeDuude: yep, remove the cap or greatly increase
[3:36:59] woodnf: Agree.  Im at 215 now but don't have KSM yet
[3:37:03] Jacksprat47: KSM already gets you a mount
[3:37:05] kokochris: agree cap 220, but just allow valor grind, no req
[3:37:06] PojaLive: @towelliee so everyone should be able to get 220 loot?
[3:37:07] zaphwarrior: Then dale system for PvP upgrading
[3:37:13] Wheeellz: 220 is not the in between
[3:37:13] zaphwarrior: Same *
[3:37:17] mhgamerkid1337: hi @Towelliee  it been a long time forgot my account log in and now im back
[3:37:18] kokochris: ya
[3:37:19] jaic316: With you on that one
[3:37:22] akia03: @Towelliee dont you think bliz will do that remove all the achievments and just let everyone upgrade
[3:37:22] bodli1125: @foxies_havocing  without meta you are fucked and thath is the problem.
[3:37:28] Nevrbloom_: @Wheeellz it literally is tho...
[3:37:28] bruhSit_farmer: thats why we seeing such massive sub drops
[3:37:30] Naganick: Who are you Towelliee Sanders here
[3:37:32] slugrite: top gs atm is 230.6 not worth the grind.
[3:37:34] byron_daniel: IMO 220 is pretty high
[3:37:35] shaken23: Guys evening, in 9.0.5 the vdh is playble again or not
[3:37:37] bouv44: you cant upgrade ALL your gear to 220  btw
[3:37:38] HammeruAzjolNerub: i dont like M+ i heal shaman aotc 205 ilvl but i cant heal a dam +9
[3:37:43] Ekvision: ah classic when you had to bandage when oom.
[3:37:44] PojaLive: 220 is the highest before mythic, I think it's ok for people to just have normal or heroic
[3:37:45] Aro725: nah no way, everyone should get 213 maybe
[3:37:45] Wheeellz: @Nevrbloom_ pvpers have to get 1800 for 220 loot
[3:37:46] bouv44: its like conquests
[3:37:49] mfJackBurton: they're trying to cater to the more elite end of the game with loot in Shadowlands
[3:37:51] kuazi1: Retail still down?
[3:37:51] jek_wi: 220 is not high chat is crazy
[3:37:53] stigmagamez: Nobody should be handed 220 loot just because they're bad lol.
[3:37:55] Nevrbloom_: @Wheeellz kek
[3:37:56] TheGaoSora: All of em..
[3:38:03] IxProNoobxI: @byron_daniel not really though i don't have KSM and i'm at 217 no pvp gear
[3:38:05] Federaldemon: Boosters gonna make HELLA  BANK KEKW
[3:38:06] Jesperoni: no because that will be normal raid level for 9.1 @byron_daniel
[3:38:13] Zip13: 220 loot with time invested eventually at the end. Not instantly
[3:38:13] woodnf: You can do one +10 a week and get 220 loot so why do I need KSM to upgrade to 220.  Almost there now
[3:38:14] slugrite: why end game grind the ilvl isn't worth it at all.
[3:38:15] kokochris: @stigmagamez you still have to grind it, its not like you cant be carried already
[3:38:15] jek_wi: 220 should be handed because it‚Äôs not even that high lol
[3:38:21] Gregadeaux: gotta stop fuckin
[3:38:26] akia03: but upgrading from a m2 to 220 is going to take weeks per piece so nothing bad
[3:38:29] laeenaravenholdt: He's got the high ground! lol
[3:38:29] Jesperoni: yeah doesn't make sense @woodnf
[3:38:54] Zomgboy: nice cat form
[3:38:55] Masqerader: They fucked mythic + to start, their fix to it, is derpy as shit, since you need to grind all the loot again to upgrade and if you're doing anything 10 or above you really don't need it cause the vault is enough to eventually get you where you need
[3:38:56] Aro725: 220s not high? its 6 lvl below mythic and 7 over heroic lol
[3:38:59] Federaldemon: YEP
[3:39:07] foxies_havocing: It's not penalizing. You don't really HAVE to do it.
[3:39:13] Jacksprat47: 220 is heroic
[3:39:14] bodli1125: the re farm of all gear is the worst ever
[3:39:15] PojaLive: Expecting everyone to have 220 is dumb, you're saying the difference between mythic raid and handouts should be 6 ilvl
[3:39:17] DrakeDuude: re-farm my bis... um... fuck that
[3:39:17] Wheeellz: @Nevrbloom_ exactly my point...you have no real argument. pve loot shouldnt just be handed for free the only 220s outside of valor is last of heroic raid
[3:39:18] Jesperoni: nah it will be below normal raid gear next tier for 9.1 @Aro725
[3:39:19] sussyrev: this guy white knighting casuals tomatoReally
[3:39:27] RodneyIsPro: ive already made a list of shit i have to farm :(
[3:39:30] slugrite: I'VE NEVER RUN MYTH OR RAID I'M AT 210.
[3:39:34] akia03: and you need to do high m+ to get allot of valor
[3:39:35] yepbeef: TRUE!!
[3:39:36] MaX_DutchyW: just let us upgrade mythic gear and were fine
[3:39:37] bruhSit_farmer: its a joke
[3:39:37] NA_Mus: yea its a pretty shit system
[3:39:38] IxProNoobxI: all those sub 220 quantum devices that people need to grind out again
[3:39:38] CanadianHellMoose: so mindlessly smashing your face against low level mythics should net you better than heroic raid ?
[3:39:38] ohnot___her: Wait
[3:39:38] bruhSit_farmer: lol
[3:39:40] tbbex_: It's meant to keep you playing so they get more sub money
[3:39:42] moonbroski: LOOT-a-cris
[3:39:42] yepbeef: PREACH!!!!
[3:39:43] ohnot___her: you cant upgrade gear rn?
[3:39:45] Bigmann109: great for my new alt
[3:39:46] NILLme: it took me weeks to get 1 trinket and im farming 15s... i cant imagine what is it for the casuals
[3:39:48] TheGaoSora: HE CARES BibleThump
[3:39:48] Chuckforfun: and because of this i will stay for ever in Classic ;D
[3:39:49] mrpresbaby: ludacris speed!
[3:39:49] Nhanced: dude idk man I love the hard grind
[3:39:49] brooksy4749: zulubishop subscribed with Prime. 
[3:39:49] Zonoxx_tv: and all for gear that will be irrelevant the SECOND 9.1 hits
[3:39:52] AstridLory: It should be +7, +10, and +13 for max upgrade
[3:39:53] liberategeorge: i feel like 9.05 valor is Beta Testing for 9.1 valor
[3:39:55] Basically_Nixx: @foxies_havocing you don't HAVE to play the game lol. That's not the point. Of course you do it if you want the items.
[3:39:57] Nevrbloom_: @Wheeellz bro it shouldnt have a requirement in general as towelliee said 1800 really isnt that hard to get. its pretty average.
[3:39:58] Nhanced: just  makes better players
[3:40:02] bodli1125: im lucky only play 2-3 chars but i already feel for the player with full slots
[3:40:03] kuazi1: @preachftw howdy
[3:40:05] AcidSyndicate: only 221.....
[3:40:07] NewfyDog: will do PVP or play classic..
[3:40:07] vluggejaapie89: tell em brother
[3:40:07] FlameStryke: since when did blizzard care about the player base
[3:40:08] MaavR6: thats why i quit in BFA, every patch i was farming the same items from mythic+
[3:40:08] kokochris: @Towelliee for the people ! @Towelliee for president ! towHype
[3:40:09] NA_Mus: @OHNOTHER  no  only gear obtained this patch can be upgraded. not before
[3:40:09] LUKA_THIM: wait you cant upgrade gear you have rn
[3:40:10] Wheeellz: @Nevrbloom_ neither is ksm
[3:40:11] yepbeef: man is spitting facts! yes!
[3:40:14] S1appadabass: I literally want to play anything but WoW right now, but cant stop
[3:40:14] grapyz: It wont change the fact that when keys get higher people often check IO. even if you have high Ilvl, if your IO is low, you will still have a hard time finding a group. So I mean does this system really work? for the casual player????
[3:40:14] noblewarcorgi: hey @Towelliee what happened to the face cam? havent watched in a while
[3:40:15] foxies_havocing: @Basically_Nixx imagine farming something in MMO, imagine
[3:40:16] mobbo: ‚ÄúYou are going to have to play the game to get stuff‚Äù
[3:40:17] laeenaravenholdt: @TranqOfo Nope
[3:40:20] mfJackBurton: LOL true
[3:40:21] Nevrbloom_: @Wheeellz i know its not. lol
[3:40:22] Alienfromger: well in mmos you have to farm LUL
[3:40:26] sussyrev: simping for the everyday player
[3:40:30] rLocks: I have already unsubbed
[3:40:30] diegorkk: Are u in classic?
[3:40:33] NILLme: getting 1800 is easier i think
[3:40:33] xXTHEJESTXx: destiny lets you infuse gear. you get trash gear at a higher level infuse it into good gear raising its item level
[3:40:39] tbbex_: I don't mind farming, I mind it when they put in insane obstacles
[3:40:40] bodli1125: yes farming is a part but refarming is a littel different
[3:40:42] PhoenixAuTv: I have ksm right now, and i feel so sorry for the player base, it really is bullshit, i want my friends to keep playing with me but it doesn't respect the time they put into the game so they're currently not playing currently. @Towelliee
[3:40:43] vluggejaapie89: insta unsubbed when i saw the patch notes
[3:40:43] CanadianHellMoose: refarming gear is not cool
[3:40:45] celestialxpeach: SAME
[3:40:46] SumZeroGG: TowAmen in the chat
[3:40:49] HammeruAzjolNerub: towGold
[3:40:51] ZeethianDragon: gottem
[3:40:52] CanadianHellMoose: but the rest of the system is fine imo
[3:40:52] FearedWoN: Destiny isn‚Äôt a real mmo also
[3:40:55] Aro725: 1800 no shot easier than ksm
[3:40:55] FlameStryke: 10% agree @Towelliee
[3:41:00] SumZeroGG: TOWAMEN
[3:41:05] ZeethianDragon: imagine making KSM a requirement. fkn stupid blizz LUL
[3:41:07] TheGaoSora: @chizu_gg it's not for free, you still need to farm valor
[3:41:07] yepbeef: Do you think this coming patch will be good?
[3:41:09] mattylash: I'm a case player with a newborn I gave up just no time
[3:41:10] mcdoublemcgee: So wait you can‚Äôt upgrade your current gear?!
[3:41:11] malmusdon: damn thats a lot of parry's
[3:41:12] Nhanced: imo the hardest keys are 7-9 keys.
[3:41:14] twiztd92: server list is up now just for them to come online
[3:41:16] FlameStryke: er 100%
[3:41:17] xXTHEJESTXx: @FearedWoN no its not but the mechanic is universal
[3:41:17] foxies_havocing: For some time people are complaining how it's too easy, make it more vanilla-like to work harder for simple shit, and now that you "have" to, it's still not ok :D
[3:41:19] Masqerader: @mcdoublemcgee correct
[3:41:20] joeyot_: what you can get 1800 in rbgs with your eyes closed
[3:41:24] akia03: thats one reason i never liked m+ every season you just get the same bit just higher itemlvl
[3:41:26] bodli1125: @mcdoublemcgee  jep you have to refarm
[3:41:28] mcdoublemcgee: That‚Äôs fcking whack
[3:41:29] Wavekingg: refearing should only happen when a new tier of raiding is released and a new season starts
[3:41:29] Nhanced: 15 keys are easy since most peeps know the mechanics generally
[3:41:29] joeyot_: its nothing even close to how hard ksm is for some
[3:41:35] PojaLive: We should make the handout gear 230, for the every day player! why not ü§£
[3:41:36] bruhSit_farmer: absolute joke
[3:41:39] AcidAbyss: Yeah your better off just not participating in their system and chillin
[3:41:41] mrpresbaby: do you think they'll revert that?
[3:41:41] IxProNoobxI: all those sub 220 quantum devices gonna be fun grinding that trinket again
[3:41:44] SilkeySmooth: my strat is waiting for classic tbc and not going for ksm
[3:41:45] Kromede: you all got fucked up KEKW
[3:41:46] Masqerader: @Towelliee did u announce the giveaway winner yet?
[3:41:49] Masqerader: lol
[3:41:52] axxowow: the problem is all the gold going just on one way........next riad world first.....so sellers not going to allow players get KSM if you don't pay lol
[3:41:52] Reklusion: Corruption V2 :)
[3:41:58] BigfishboyOG: Did somebody say Blumpkin?
[3:41:59] myguyhood: i dont think it will be reverted
[3:41:59] bouv44: we dont even have valor yet like it doesnt matter
[3:42:00] MWilco77: anything that makes you feel like you're taking a step back in progression feels bad
[3:42:04] myguyhood: otherwise it would have been reverted already
[3:42:05] vluggejaapie89: u cant cap 5k
[3:42:05] AcidSyndicate: THATS BS
[3:42:06] RodneyIsPro: thought cap was 1.5k per char
[3:42:06] mavericks312: there is a 99.5 % chance the requirements are gone in a week or 2
[3:42:07] bouv44: they should def revert that
[3:42:08] vluggejaapie89: 1.5
[3:42:11] Aro725: 50 valor per dungeon inc LUL
[3:42:16] UnluckyPhil: Diamond Hands!
[3:42:17] Jesperoni: nope they reversed that @Cursed13337
[3:42:18] azinverted92: you can only hold 1.5k
[3:42:20] bruhSit_farmer: they owe us the other mount options now imo
[3:42:21] akia03: was like 100 valor for dungeon m6 i think it was
[3:42:21] tommy_thick: is it really that different from raiding tho? you gotta kill a boss for 8 weeks to get the pieces you want.
[3:42:21] foxies_havocing: Just farm valor and different keys, don't farm specific items in specific dungeons, when you get it you get it, then upgrade it
[3:42:22] D3m0nHunt3r666: get all the gear in 2 weeks, 3 months to level in classic lol
[3:42:23] Zonoxx_tv: @Cursed13337 they changed that
[3:42:23] MourvinMad: whats the addon to get rid of then bottom interface and the gryuphons?
[3:42:25] ZeethianDragon: shadowlands is gonna crash hard if they don't revert it
[3:42:26] Ultratide_: Theyre not going to revert that, theyve already doubled down
[3:42:27] syn_the_unforgiven: casuals need to stay out of M+ and stick to doing their 2-3 log ins for their guild raid nights. Just my opinion
[3:42:29] yepbeef: I only pvp do i have to farm valor?
[3:42:29] UnluckyPhil: valor to the moon EZ
[3:42:29] byron_daniel: people are so late on news LOL
[3:42:33] tbbex_: @Aro725 nah fam, they'll give u 1 xtra valor
[3:42:33] FearedWoN: Blizz is terrible for nerfing winfwalker
[3:42:36] Teitanblood: its not 50 per dungeon
[3:42:37] FlameStryke: @towellie welcome all of you retail players who quit and go back to classic
[3:42:42] Mystirose: cinematic spoilers up on Wow Head if you want to be spoiled.
[3:42:43] longdongliam_: the achievement requirements i think are necessary. but the unable to upgrade loot pre to the patch is dumb
[3:42:44] nightmare509: how much per dungeon?
[3:42:45] SonofHorus82: @MourvinMad I use Bartender.
[3:42:47] azinverted92: fuckin a. nice
[3:42:48] wowrofls: blizzard needs to uncap honor next!
[3:42:49] liberategeorge: callings are 35-50 valor, dungeons should be at least that
[3:42:56] mavericks312: @CotBH_Kryptic without casuals wow dies
[3:42:57] rocthenite: you ate more of a whiner then asmon in bfa
[3:43:02] theirishprofessor: @Towelliee the valor system is usless to me LUL, i only need stone legion trink at 233 im fully bis pretty much do sale carries on alts and even their full 220/bis
[3:43:02] girlz__: i hope its already 250
[3:43:02] vluggejaapie89: 50 per calling is a joke
[3:43:02] Masqerader: @Towelliee I feel it will be like echoes and it scales by key level
[3:43:02] madmini808: i dont want the game to be easy to get geared up
[3:43:02] jek_wi: I have bis none of it upgradable
[3:43:03] bodli1125: with tbc classic get way more interesting now
[3:43:05] facerolljack: if dungeons are 50 they might aswell delete valor again lol
[3:43:05] RodneyIsPro: if they would just get rid of KSM id be happy or at least untimed 15s
[3:43:06] cerality: The valor scales with key level
[3:43:06] Federaldemon: Calling takes 5min Dungeon takes atleast 20 min
[3:43:08] Jacksprat47: it'll probably be like 10 per key level or some shit like that
[3:43:10] akia03: saw a m6 with 100 valor screenshot somewhere
[3:43:11] GusherTV: Im hoping dungeons are 100-150
[3:43:12] Reklusion: I think some people did like 3-4s and it was 135 ... I hope it increases on key level..
[3:43:13] fistofnature: pepeMeltdown update
[3:43:18] vluggejaapie89: dungeon should be 250
[3:43:21] GnomeLickerGames: if callings give u more then dungeons blizz f up big time
[3:43:22] xvstormvx: @Towelliee where do we upgrade the gear at?? our covenent??
[3:43:25] Ginentonic: 50-200 is my guess
[3:43:28] Dirtroit: @cotbh_kryptic imagine being such an elitist price LUL
[3:43:29] mobbo: All I want... is a Phial
[3:43:36] GnomeLickerGames: be another 35 anima situation all over again
[3:43:37] Ckn1ght: Can't upgrade anyway if I don't get any drops SeemsGood
[3:43:40] Teitanblood: I heard a +6 gave 160 valor (seen on wowhead). But that sounds a bit high @Towelliee
[3:43:41] nightmare509: oh fck phial...need to farm that again...
[3:43:42] ZeethianDragon: KSM Requirement. extreme gating
[3:43:43] Clover__North: When do you think servers go back up?
[3:43:44] Ledeanna: technical reasons on why you cannot upgrade if they did that then you would not get Valor till 9.1 but they wanted the system our before
[3:43:46] Basically_Nixx: My guess would be peaking at +15 with 250 per run
[3:43:46] DrFantastic: like 50 for a +5 mythic dungeon and 100 for a +10 mythic dungeon
[3:43:46] bodli1125: man i have to get my guild to make money with 15+ keys ;D
[3:43:52] nightmare509: i got no weapons on my fury warrior..still with 200 lol
[3:44:02] axxowow: control is killing a great game....sad
[3:44:04] JMoney_1331: Also @Yokingdom grats on winning the giveaway
[3:44:05] ItsSmashar: Will our vault gear from this reset be able to be upgraded?
[3:44:05] Kinghorn: CHILL is the chill guild. dont steal our brand kelpLUL
[3:44:15] bruhSit_farmer: nope ewan
[3:44:16] Basically_Nixx: @EwanSmasher no
[3:44:18] azinverted92: is that EST?
[3:44:19] Yokingdom: @JMoney_1331 thank you :)
[3:44:23] TheGaoSora: Brand yoinked... @Kinghorn
[3:44:24] Nico_vdM: not this week's vault
[3:44:26] syn_the_unforgiven: i am, i wont deny it, but it doesnt mean i dont help guidlies out
[3:44:28] bodli1125: @Towelliee  see the positive you can make massive goldw with keys now ;d
[3:44:33] mrpresbaby: @EwanSmasher no
[3:44:36] MWviking: @EwanSmasher they said nothing prior to this week for upgrade so idk if that includes this week
[3:44:40] greenswoof: getting the actual piece of loot is gonna suck
[3:44:41] razbuug2: are servers up ??
[3:44:42] Itzmatt1992: @yokingdom grats dude so lucky!
[3:44:44] longdongliam_: you shouldnt be able to get 220 gear without getting the 15 key achieve. makes it to casual
[3:44:47] GnomeLickerGames: key Lvl x10 would be a good amount
[3:44:50] aTufo: i heard that they adjusted the valor on last second
[3:45:08] partymaniac87: alt 15 intime haha
[3:45:15] Niixten: specific gear boost inc

[4:17:18] GrimlicTV: I remember the first patch of wrath when mages could solo the military quarter of naxx due to an arcane talent LUL
[4:17:23] Bleusempai: between BM hunter and Demon Warlock which is 'better' for a first timer to classic?
[4:17:52] roflpotamus: both easy lol
[4:17:54] sleazysenpai_: Even in retail you could probably do dungeons with 5 blood dks. They heal so much its ridiculous
[4:17:56] BRUTALIT0PS: I would say Hunter is easier to get into
[4:17:57] KnsWoW: im doing bm this time..

[4:18:41] Apokolipz: when i first started my friend said  try rogue in tbc    youll learn the basics
[4:18:42] ZakuzaGB: i think people who didnt play bc need to prepare for the fact that class balance wasnt just around dps numbers
[4:18:46] Patrikhg: fury warrior does extremely well also in tbc
[4:18:50] Epixil: towelliee how long do you think it will take people to level from 60 to 70?
[4:19:03] submotion: hunters used to be so much more fun to play imo, in retail they are boring since ages
[4:19:16] roflpotamus: Its the fights that kinda fuck with the dps meta
[4:19:17] SutureTV: can't wait for tbc for my ele shaman to pop off
[4:19:18] Mathhbm: wanted to play shadow priest in tbc, but it is not very good :(

[4:19:35] 3663Sharad: MM Hunter? LUL
[4:19:37] BlueBeast33: shadow priest is big, not top dps but huge support

[4:35:19] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: even less goldsink is what we need Kappa
[4:35:22] Ahlstr0m_: @Towelliee do you think they should add the gold token in classic to help against gold farming bots
[4:35:30] qwerth: maybe make DS a gold sync too
[4:35:38] bruhSit_farmer: bots will still exist with tokens just like they do in retail
[4:35:40] Mathhbm: @Towelliee do you think they should have used the new graphics in classic?
[4:35:43] DegenerateHaven: lol no
[4:35:45] Hypsipyl3: hey tow which wings of torghast are open this week
[4:35:52] TheGaoSora: D:

[4:36:04] bruhSit_farmer: in bastion and arden
[4:36:06] DegenerateHaven: improve bot detection instead
[4:36:07] TweakT: gold tokens are the devil and they should reset golde
[4:36:09] Aidler: it‚Äòs all about the experience. classic modernized and envisioned as it should be. #somechanges
[4:36:15] SutureTV: @Towelliee would you move to a fresh server if they come on prepatch?
[4:36:15] Mathhbm: @Towelliee do you think they should have used the new graphics in classic?
[4:36:15] Ahlstr0m_: agreed
[4:36:17] dawginspace: Wise
[4:36:27] bruhSit_farmer: next theyll be asking for retail graphics in classic though
[4:36:29] HEYYOUGUYS__: i hope they add tokens i need something to spend my stimulus check on
[4:36:37] TheGaoSora: yup
[4:36:44] Tw1tchyy: !TBC
[4:36:44] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[4:37:03] TweakT: keeping bots in the game is toxic

[4:37:11] einself111: yeah but people quit because of bots i quit because of bot situation in classic
[4:37:14] DjLamboImBenz: How is a wow token 20$ to them?
[4:37:22] Poriand: they know what they are doing with these bots. they want that money
[4:37:24] Mathhbm: @Towelliee do you think they should have used the new graphics in classic?
[4:37:24] yokai_5: 9.0.5 is out ?
[4:37:27] t0xx1nn: did you see that Microsoft acquired Bethesda for like 7.5b? wild
[4:37:33] bruhSit_farmer: bots fund bobby's helicopters
[4:37:41] Diisplaced: The SM bots are insane right now
[4:37:41] TweakT: peepo are pretty mad seing bots
[4:37:42] aTufo: those bots pay their sub with 1 account farming gold tho they dont really earn much from them
[4:37:45] DegenerateHaven: havent seen any bots in bgs on retail
[4:37:46] Phae__: But if they can buy game time with gold, then there's only hypothetically an initial investment of those accounts and not a long-term investment, no? Just need to get the accounts rolling so they can start farming the gold
[4:37:49] bruhSit_farmer: wtch the asmon moonkin bot video
[4:37:57] bruhSit_farmer: that shit will make you angry
[4:37:59] Crowargus: oh yup client updated to 9.05 weird had to restart computer for update to start

[4:38:24] Buckwink: they are still flooding the AH
[4:38:24] Aidler: asmon got them all banned
[4:38:25] bruhSit_farmer: you can pvp bots in classic though
[4:38:26] Bovined: @DjLamboImBenz a wow token costs $20 to buy, however when activated it gives $15. therefore each token is an additional $5 of generated money that blizzard gets. And since the items are non tangible its a full $20 profit.
[4:38:27] unholyhoit: @Towelliee they despawn the nodes by sheer numbers
[4:38:28] bruhSit_farmer: you cant in retail
[4:38:32] TweakT: in retaile they made the zones super anti-bot, I dont see any bots farming shit in the maw
[4:38:33] TweakT: its great
[4:38:34] NILLme: and destroying the market
[4:38:47] neverbornlucky: blizzard we do not believe in mask in texas move to texas
[4:38:54] bruhSit_farmer: yea profs suck in sl
[4:38:59] pliskee: well, in classic AH was really the source of income
[4:38:59] Affiiance: Yeah they do good with bots on Retail
[4:39:00] stopdodgin: alchemy? very
[4:39:05] Zomgboy: i reported some bots and it actually worked
[4:39:07] Buckwink: professions would be more relevant without bots
[4:39:10] ChumpsMcGee: a lot of retail bots groups though run around with node cap (10) so it's the same as botting in classic
[4:39:18] bruhSit_farmer: more resources to classic
[4:39:20] bruhSit_farmer: yay
[4:39:28] kiviroo: Towelliee is the prot paly the best dungeon booster from level 1-60 ?
[4:39:28] TweakT: the fact u can only stay in the maw for X amount of time is an example of an anti-bot measure
[4:39:32] BlueBeast33: professions are a pretty big deal in TBC so hopefully something is done
[4:39:33] FresheFefe: you are not prepared
[4:39:35] zvertdruid: Force everyone to play with war mode on.
[4:39:41] TheGaoSora: just block Chinese ips /s

[4:40:15] elchaposkjelbo: when's servers up?
[4:40:29] zvertdruid: 1pm pst
[4:40:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: one good thing is on a pvp server outland will be a more condensed area so you can find bots easier and players could camp the bots if they wanted
[4:40:52] xTomHolmes: Towellie bot confirmed
[4:40:52] Rebolts: are the servers back up?
[4:40:54] TheGaoSora: He's probably a booster..

[4:43:07] Versedric: hows your rashy rash @Towelliee

[4:43:18] Apokolipz: towelliee i  will be there when tbc launches :)
[4:43:22] Bovined: why does it matter if it has bots? not like they will be able to farm in hotspots due to pvp
[4:43:30] Versedric: What server is this?
[4:43:30] NILLme: the thing i really learned from a high pop server are the queues :D
[4:43:34] Aidler: the bots will unfortunately follow the people
[4:43:41] VansFan07: I play on that server and didn‚Äôt see anyone farming earth ele in badlands where a lot of boys are
[4:43:48] TweakT: prolly
[4:43:48] Mathhbm: dunno
[4:43:51] TweakT: wouldnt make sense

[4:44:15] Apokolipz: heheh  all the bots will meet  the Fel Reaver alot

[4:44:24] Sincline387: original bc pre patch did not
[4:44:26] BlackMarmalade: yes
[4:44:33] ForklyftTV: @Towelliee without JC they would have to work the Belf and Draenie zones
[4:44:34] Artiiz: !cam
[4:44:34] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[4:44:38] Sincline387: it's all one skill and you must get max

[4:54:16] Murlocz: Im 100% in favor of boost
[4:54:24] A_Cold_0ne: the boost is a godsend
[4:54:25] KinRL: i agree
[4:54:27] SeckSymbols: Classic leveling sucks anyways
[4:54:30] pjp1113: excited to play with friends who didnt play classic :)
[4:54:35] GuyInRobe: a boost for classic and TBC? maybe a boost to 60 when TBC release but not max level
[4:54:36] KinRL: the boost keeps people playing both live and classic
[4:54:37] bruhSit_farmer: classic leveling is its best part
[4:54:38] LazaarusGaming: Except when it gets abused by RMTers
[4:54:39] SeleneVoelkerVT: no one likes to grind
[4:54:40] just_kirk_: Can you boost a pally?
[4:54:41] bruhSit_farmer: imo
[4:54:42] TweakT: they didn't even include a recruit a friend feature
[4:54:42] papaseat: gatekeeping
[4:54:43] Aktz_: They dont have to do what you are doing now  :) :) @Towelliee
[4:54:43] A_Klimas: bc starting zones are gonna be a nightmare
[4:54:45] Kallat11: boosts are fine
[4:54:46] all_beef_franks: you only get 1, so its not a huge deal
[4:54:48] DegenerateHaven: should get a free boost with the launch of tbc,i dont like the fact its paid from the get go
[4:54:51] st4sisfield: I 100% have no interest in TBC if there's no boost
[4:54:51] A_Klimas: worse than back in the day
[4:54:52] Ultratide_: I hate leveling , I love the end game shit though
[4:54:53] Zavier420: In the original TBC wasn't the only auction houses still in org and IF?
[4:54:56] ChumpsMcGee: especially with the player base split between classic, bc and retail? yeah, give us the boosts
[4:54:57] wreckedgum: is there a video on your chat with him towellie?
[4:55:06] atamdev: I wouldn't bother playing TBC if i didnt get a boost. no way im levelling through classic
[4:55:10] girlz__: servers still not up lol wtf
[4:55:15] bruhSit_farmer: boosts will have outlands busy as fuck though
[4:55:17] DocsMistake: I mean putting in WoW token helps combat gold sellers in theory right
[4:55:18] bruhSit_farmer: but yea
[4:55:18] amigrow: @a_klimas Yeah but part of that was fun back in the day
[4:55:18] girlz__: extended maintenancce inc
[4:55:21] ChiefBeard: I'm gonna boost for BC
[4:55:21] wreckedgum: i honestly dont know why people get so triggered
[4:55:24] einself111: @Towelliee Fresh servers with a 1x lvl 50 boost once you reach max level is what i want
[4:55:24] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:55:24] chrslp: They gonna make millions from boosts
[4:55:25] S1appadabass: leveling was the big classic thing, thats what classic was all about... starting in TBC leveling is insignificant
[4:55:25] wreckedgum: about the boost
[4:55:28] Murlocz: "oh i lost weeks and months leveling you gotta do the same too  payoB payoB payoB "
[4:55:30] tbbex_: I think boosting for gold is more ethical than paid boosts for cash irl
[4:55:31] talesHQ: classic?
[4:55:39] bruhSit_farmer: tbc leveling is still big
[4:55:40] Alienfromger: how much is the boost?
[4:55:42] wreckedgum: it makes sense, dont like it? dont boost a character. i expect most people who will boost will have other chars anyways
[4:55:42] Friiz_The_Gamer: #StopTheBoost...staysafe
[4:55:45] AricWest: yup - 100% zero interest in classic. didn't play one bit. Fully interested in TBC though
[4:55:45] bruhSit_farmer: much larger than retail
[4:55:52] swampt1l: Are servers still down?
[4:55:58] InfiniFiasco: are servers okay?
[4:56:04] Soulsoap: 33% faster 20-60 iirc
[4:56:07] papaseat: LULW Naxx on 2.1
[4:56:07] DemonicGrizz: @Towelliee How did you get your classic UI to look like you retail UI would like to make mine look like that also
[4:56:09] Robodope: if you boost will you have enough gold to get flying by end of TBC leveling?
[4:56:12] chrslp: 10 levels LUL
[4:56:18] S1appadabass: half the damn community is gonna dungeon level anyways
[4:56:26] Murlocz: Casual people will stay behind anyway, i dont get the fear of people catching up LUL
[4:56:31] Mathhbm: Normal dungeon is just burn KEKW
[4:56:33] tbbex_: how much does flying cost in tbc (mount plus skill)?
[4:56:47] st4sisfield: BC is just a smoother experience overall
[4:56:48] Mathhbm: @TBBEX_ 50k anima Kappa
[4:56:51] RobNXS: Are servers up yet?
[4:56:59] Murlocz: @Towelliee There are 4 IRL friends of mine, that tried classic, stopped playing and they coming back to BC cuz of the boost
[4:57:01] SonofHorus82: nah there was way to much personality in that, you need to be waaaaaaaaaay more monotone than that.
[4:57:02] bruhSit_farmer: they should increase exp requirements for 58-70 ...make it a month long grind
[4:57:03] Gizadragon: a men to that boost for the win
[4:57:05] Skarekrow1990: at original launch of TBC most didnt have enough gold at 70 to buy a flying mount right out, took a little grinding anyway
[4:57:09] A_Klimas: gonna be a race to get outta hellfire if they dont have sharding lol
[4:57:09] KnsWoW: that was me
[4:57:14] GoodGuyHeliioz: me lol
[4:57:17] DegenerateHaven: cant wait for wotlk classic, ready to move on from warmane
[4:57:20] ChiefBeard: I stopped at 27
[4:57:21] Robodope: its me my 35 shaman is afk in shimmering flats
[4:57:23] papaseat: 1k normal, 5k epic IIRC @tbbex
[4:57:25] Sheatyy: yeah i got to 35 in classic and quit. TOO grindy
[4:57:30] Poriand: ima boost and i have a 60 mage. i want a rogue
[4:57:31] rocthenite: 51
[4:57:32] Soulsoap: I don't mind if people boost honestly. For me personally, I like having that investment/connection to my character
[4:57:35] mvk315: big fat TRUE
[4:57:39] georgiebulgarianfart_king: LUL
[4:57:43] Gargantix: I quit 3 times during 1-60, and only got 60 2 months ago, when classic has been out for ages because the grind was just so boring.
[4:57:43] TweakT: why make TBC cater to retailers is beyond me
[4:57:49] jerexify: Yeah, I stopped at 22...
[4:57:50] bruhSit_farmer: the grind is the big appeal of classic
[4:57:56] bruhSit_farmer: in the first place
[4:58:01] papaseat: and ever FeelsGoodMan
[4:58:01] Masqerader: shimmering flats has carrot on the stick!
[4:58:04] SG_World: stopped on my 51 healer and I didnt have time to find groups
[4:58:08] abbosss: people should be grateful they're doing classic and TBC at all
[4:58:09] D3m0nHunt3r666: he loves classic too much
[4:58:10] Wulfgrym: all i see are other streamers crying about the boost and meanwhile they are the same people funnelling loot to themselves in their guilds, so i find it hypocritical
[4:58:14] Alegnowar: @TweakT becouse otherwise u have a dead game in ur hands
[4:58:18] D3m0nHunt3r666: he will move on, but not sure he will fully enjoy it
[4:58:19] NickLeonhearth: Who's the person Tow talked to?
[4:58:26] KnsWoW: you are 1000% right i will boost and enjoy tbc without the hasstle of classic
[4:58:27] ChilbotDrew: where would one go to get boost
[4:58:28] roflpotamus: actual hard raiding LUL
[4:58:35] Gargantix: TBC was when I started, so I can agree lol
[4:58:36] papaseat: you mean a rotation?
[4:58:37] TweakT: They could've just included a RAF like they did in actual TBC & Wrath, they didn't even mention RAF as an option just tried to sell a boost, it's not needed
[4:58:37] jerexify: @KnsWoW Same here.
[4:58:37] bruhSit_farmer: meh tbc alot different to retail though
[4:58:41] ChiefBeard: BC brought in all the Belf fan bois
[4:58:44] SeckSymbols: Wrath > Classic
[4:58:45] tbbex_: I dont really see the issue with the boosts
[4:58:48] ShadowCsharp: !time
[4:58:48] Moobot: Towelliee's time is currently 09:58:34 PST
[4:58:50] bruhSit_farmer: tbc > wrath ez
[4:58:54] A_Klimas: BC was probably peak WoW for me, only expac where I never took a break and managed to see all the content
[4:59:03] Rubbadubdub418: yup have a 40 magle in pagel stopped playing it cause I started after pvp came out and didn't have bgs
[4:59:05] efficacyyyy: 100% classic is the most different from retail
[4:59:06] S1appadabass: The classic andys always wanted TBC anyways
[4:59:07] TweakT: @Alegnowar dead game? are u retarded?
[4:59:13] Robodope: I just wanna see what the endgame hype was about
[4:59:34] chrslp: Cmon TBC beta

[5:00:03] abbosss: classic Andy's are those dudes who never get over going to regionals in high school football
[5:00:04] papaseat: the goal was gatekeeping not a pleasing gaming experience lol
[5:00:06] Reklusion: Most of those people never played vanilla :')
[5:00:09] DishChi: Are you guys happy with upcoming valor system?
[5:00:09] jasperboy: I've played since vanilla, but im a MOP andy LUL
[5:00:10] SeckSymbols: @hjo1992 That is not true

[5:00:22] Poriand: i played so much BC back in the day
[5:00:30] Kallat11: TBC and Wrath were my favorite expansions
[5:00:31] DocsMistake: i think private servers ruined a lot of people's expectations about the game lol
[5:00:33] Phae__: Attunement quests were actually rewarding and fun
[5:00:33] chrslp: Kara attunement easy
[5:00:34] TweakT: They could've NOT mentioned any boost whatsoever and nerds would've Drooled over TBC, they could've said RAF here you go catchup, we nerf vanilla xp anyway, they're greedy bastards
[5:00:35] SycosFamily: Where‚Äôs your camera man haven‚Äôt been here in a while
[5:00:36] SSD511_: I transferred to brazilen classic server and i get rank 14 ez clap lol
[5:00:36] Skarekrow1990: classic now is still not the same experience as it was when live. min/max and streamer culture changed everything even for the more casual guild
[5:00:42] holyshackle: I'm a cata baby :( I played end of wrath but not enough to experience it
[5:00:52] Utmost777: truuuuuue
[5:00:55] tbbex_: How long is ur treatment btw Towelliee
[5:00:55] Phae__: Attunements actually gave you a sense that the raid was important. It gave the storyline some weight.
[5:00:56] nchester51: real talk
[5:00:56] BlackMarmalade: Gating is just fucking boring in retail
[5:00:56] rocthenite: i think he mean gatekeeping as in the classic fans gatekeeping classic
[5:00:57] Jamesthespud: I only played Classic with the hope they would to TBC
[5:01:00] chrslp: You only have to run 3 dungeons for Kara attune. Thats easy as fuck
[5:01:06] papaseat: no I was referring to Vanilla streamers being uppity about changes resulting in gatekeeping @Towelliee

[5:01:55] N3llee: orginally
[5:02:17] N3llee: @Towelliee TBC launched that way... any Classic ANDY just wants the TBC release to be like it was orginally.

[5:03:03] N3llee: all good changes i think as well
[5:03:05] JakNyfe: servers still not up
[5:03:05] Cidal_: @Towelliee are they gonna remove the Kara and other raids attunement?
[5:03:07] xvstormvx: @Towelliee ive always just done and played what makes me happy.. and ive been playing since original wow beta so..
[5:03:08] holyshackle: classic andies do lmao
[5:03:13] chrslp: Prepatch leveling is sweet
[5:03:14] N3llee: but not launching with SSC/Eye is bad
[5:03:15] icemansk: listen my guy, if you want easy and no effort, you go retail, but if you want the adventure of lvling you can go BC or classic. This is the idea. You have both options. This was the whole idea with classic, to let ppl relive the old days, not to make it easy. We have easy if we want to. The idea was to experience classic /BC as it was. If you add all the shit that ruined retail to classic servers, it's no point in making them.
[5:03:15] Goblinemporium: It's a great change honestly
[5:03:21] D0tmatic: any date onprepatch?
[5:03:27] liberategeorge: anti-antis
[5:03:27] papaseat: truest take

[5:03:49] N3llee: fuck ads
[5:03:49] jaina8675309: dk prepatch when wrath comes to
[5:03:49] ShrenTheOrc: they might as well add transmog and updated models

[5:03:52] kuazi1: Retail is never coming back online
[5:03:53] rocthenite: their humor is still stuck in 2006
[5:03:55] SeckSymbols: @TweakT Simple as that
[5:03:55] N3llee: right when the convo was getting good
[5:03:57] holyshackle: they're trying to relive a experience that is impossible, the online gaming community has changed
[5:04:09] Sweetzer81: ok Boomer Kap
[5:04:10] verZUNGE: as eminem said "You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though"
[5:04:15] TweakT: @Secksymbols oh bet ya I wont pay for it, I won't play it either
[5:04:20] vanzx: Dual spec inc
[5:04:28] jasperboy: @N3llee How is that bad? If those raids released on launch, the whole tier 5 content would be done in like 1-2 weeks
[5:04:29] SeckSymbols: @TweakT I didnt know that you had a gun to your head saying that you needed to pay for it, you sound like a whiney baby
[5:04:29] verZUNGE: rap god baby

[5:04:39] Utmost777: I know P2 killed classic for me cuz im not a big pvper
[5:04:40] Shangrolam: we want mop classic
[5:04:42] holyshackle: I'm down for dual spec, I'm gonna be playing paladin, I'll need it
[5:04:46] kynbrook74: yeah
[5:04:51] TweakT: @Secksymbols what else do I sound like?

[5:04:55] SeckSymbols: BabyRage
[5:05:00] holyshackle: @DeanoTV oh fuck yeah Kreygasm
[5:05:02] ChiefBeard: When the game was live we all bitched about what we wanted to be changed. Now that we have a chance to change some things we don't want it. people are nutty.
[5:05:03] Wavekingg: i wanna play legion classic so badly, my fav expansion so far
[5:05:06] Skarekrow1990: yes they were there
[5:05:08] vanzx: I think dual spec could be more incentive to play. personally
[5:05:09] TweakT: @Secksymbols actual grownup you are
[5:05:09] xrandomdoodx: if they do legion classic, they better change the legendary drop system early lol
[5:05:09] Aspectt10: @Towelliee I would play Classic but the Prot Paladin fucking SUCKS. I wish Blizz would balance the classes so they can be viable.
[5:05:10] xluthax: servers up?
[5:05:10] ShrenTheOrc: id say they should change everything give like a different expansion that fucks shit up
[5:05:11] N3llee: @N3llee @jasperboy how is that bad? That impacts what maybe 1% of the player pop
[5:05:28] TweakT: @Secksymbols 12 year old's twitch name btw
[5:05:32] Poriand: im excited for arena
[5:05:35] N3llee: Most players will take a week to level and at least a week to do the attunments
[5:05:42] SeckSymbols: @TweakT You are complaining about something that has literally 0 impact on you, you sound entitled as if Blizz should give you what you want whenever you want it.
[5:05:47] Murlocz: I leveled 3 toons myself from 1 to 60, the leveling experience was what made Classic worth for me. But i dont see a problem at all with Boosting, gonna get one myself
[5:05:50] SeckSymbols: Quit crying
[5:05:50] TweakT: @Secksymbols it does have impact on me

[5:18:40] sleazysenpai_: I mean. There's lots of places that are dark themed in the WoW universe that have more charm than The Maw
[5:18:40] SageRuskiy: Compare the Maw to Isle of Queldanas, Isle of Thunder or Timeless Isle
[5:18:43] Everbliss: TOrghast should drop Anima imo
[5:18:44] Gurgaue: I get what you mean, it doesn't grab me and make itself interesting
[5:18:44] SageRuskiy: THe maw has 0 charm
[5:18:48] GamerKillance: Maw sucked and so did their loot philosphy

[5:19:20] grapyz: the maw? I spent max 1h a week in that place because there is actually no point to go there lmao
[5:19:20] SonofHorus82: it's the colorization of the maw. a lot of muted greys and blacks make it boring and uncomfortable to look at.
[5:19:22] tykela: I might have missed it but how do you feel about the old M+ gear not being able to be upgraded?
[5:19:32] h_u_r_k_: KEKW

[5:20:39] DrakeDuude: the new zone will probably replace the maw stuff
[5:20:45] SageRuskiy: Its Spygia, totally unrelated to stygia
[5:20:47] Phae__: You won't have to deal with the eye of the jailer because you'll just get merc'd upon entering the Maw

[6:23:22] Ultratide_: ???? I mean they send this stuff out all the time. bogus KEKW
[6:23:24] magemaster225: servers so delicate a gift mount gonna break a game
[6:23:26] SeckSymbols: @sleazypal But that is not changing anything, the items already existed at those ilvl intervals
[6:23:29] RunklePunch: Im poor
[6:23:31] shmasherd: The player rage is going to be amazing
[6:23:37] Naganick: Have KSM? get mount sooner
[6:23:41] Decoyszn: @cahoots82 what did I miss, what the announce?
[6:23:49] TheGaoSora: @Towelliee just msg them there's a silent 'a' before the T
[6:23:54] Gregadeaux: It's your guildy. That mage with the funny name
[6:24:03] VictorAvalanche: that 60 is in hammer squad
[6:24:04] aPandaAppears: But we all get mounts at the same time when pre orders go out.
[6:24:04] SeleneVoelkerVT: millions?
[6:24:08] Nevrbloom_: LUL
[6:24:11] zyrokor: HYPERS
[6:24:12] SonofHorus82: This area of the Bandlands is a known botter hotspot.
[6:24:13] Ultratide_: the same as everything else in the game? KEKW
[6:24:14] Kromede: server explodes
[6:24:20] real_pay10ad: @Secksymbols but..they are. Otherwise you would have previously been able to upgrade them.
[6:24:26] deadawake_: If they had actual dedicated servers but..... Activision hates those
[6:24:34] warrenny: Nah itll be streamers then plebs üòÇ
[6:24:41] TheGaoSora: whops
[6:24:49] theoriginalzinng: im excited for the wowhead comments about the delay
[6:24:51] jimmix12: what mount @Towelliee
[6:24:51] prismatic1111: look at all the shit that drops in poe and they handle it fine
[6:24:52] Kinghorn: didnt someone say they were sending you some mail?
[6:24:52] IntrpdMuppet: is the wandering ancient mount a freebie?
[6:24:55] hanshundscasperle: !sha
[6:24:58] JiveDude: Its probably just that they needed to update the databases for everybody. Not soo much the processing of 1 item on server.
[6:25:03] SeckSymbols: @sleazypal I never said you could upgrade them, I said the items you are talking about needing change already existed at the ilvls that the valor system would bring. Those items are already in the game in the 3 ivll intervals
[6:25:16] Klauzzer: maybe you will be one of the lucky ones
[6:25:27] geokouts: the Wandering Ancient has been delayed
[6:25:35] Durithane: I need Ma tree mount!
[6:25:35] Decoyszn: did they post this on wowhead? or what
[6:25:36] PokerFaceMoose: wandering ancient won me some channel points, so i dont mind
[6:25:38] zulkhanis: Just got back, I guess Kargath won? :p
[6:25:41] Decoyszn: where are we reading about the wandering ancient delay?
[6:25:43] JiveDude: its a db upgrade statement thats hanging. :p
[6:25:45] rohdey: wouldn't have happened if the Slime Cat won
[6:25:45] mrniceguy817: So extended maintenance? Lul
[6:25:45] c4mmweir: How do you get the wandering ancient
[6:25:49] Plague_GG: multi dollar company btw
[6:25:49] Wukain: mount lives matter
[6:25:51] Carryout: should have picked the grub as a mount
[6:26:00] Mr_Pennywise_: 200IQ
[6:26:01] Kalidin79: LUL
[6:26:03] zero_chronos_x: I'm not too stoked for valour points.

[6:26:20] Decoyszn: where did they post about the mount?
[6:26:20] JiveDude: insert into player_mounts where exists .....
[6:26:25] theoriginalzinng: prediction, towelliee hitting lvl 40 in classic or retail servers coming up
[6:26:30] PrimogenitureJ: I bet the book wouldnt have crashed the servers
[6:26:32] ZeeBone117: i just wanna open my vault
[6:26:32] SlowpokeIsAGamer: Retail players mad, just play some Classic. slowpo1KEK
[6:26:34] geokouts: i have seen it Icy veins website that Wandering Ancient wont come till few weeks more
[6:26:36] Durithane: @c4mmweir all active accounts with shadowlands gets the mount
[6:26:45] real_pay10ad: @Secksymbols The change is that they are upgradable now, tho. You're saying they're not changing the items. They literally are. None of the items you had in game yesterday can be upgraded, therefore the items are changing because now the drops WILL be able to be. I realize I was being unclear earlier, I hope this clarifies my point.
[6:26:48] Nalleys: LUL
[6:26:49] c4mmweir: Thanks !

[7:12:47] Kinghorn: its gonna be 5 per
[7:12:50] kabam11: +10 should geive like 300
[7:12:55] Rogolan: Rogolan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[7:13:01] Kinghorn: this will be worth 40
[7:13:11] Niixten: "Mission Table Experience Missions Massively Buffed in 9.0.5"
[7:13:24] MrGattz: a plus 10 should give you like 75-100
[7:13:26] Atokiri: if it 5 per level key its still good amount, a lot of us grind a shit load of dung weekly LUL
[7:13:28] Avaleria: Jumped into the maw and died :(
[7:13:30] Aquadriel: problem is people is leaving cuz too much grind KEKW
[7:13:33] gooseflesh: I mean you get like 35 conquest for a single arena win, arena games are like 1/10 the length of a m+
[7:13:38] ravenofjudgement: you still need to get the item
[7:13:40] jerseyfive: 85
[7:13:44] dutchie76: yea they have to keep you grinding because 9.1 isnt coming out until July Kappa
[7:13:48] Reklusion: 85
[7:13:51] DudeInARobe: depends if you take the slimes in the right room ornot
[7:13:52] Phil87z: Gotta stretch the content haha
[7:13:52] zacpuentes: 85
[7:13:53] DegenerateHaven: i dont understand why they couldnt make the system like PVP where you go for example from 213 to 220 in 1 upgrade
[7:13:55] Arsannic: 85,6
[7:13:58] sh1asurprise: And the cap of 750 a week should be feasible for most players i feel,
[7:14:03] Dynwor: but i have other toons to gear
[7:14:05] the_SAVCXX_NXMAD: by the time you finish grinding, new patch comes out and gear is obsolete
[7:14:08] Jacksprat47: 85.6, 82.3? with slimes?
[7:14:08] vemkmeuput: 83% and u get 2 glob downstairs
[7:14:09] Arsannic: But you can pull blobs aswell
[7:14:11] verZUNGE: there are also slimes in the hallways after you drop down
[7:14:17] zvertdruid: lol where the content blizzard?
[7:14:17] zacpuentes: theres always the slimes on the way up for 3%
[7:14:22] Kinghorn: there is no cap because it is mid-season sh1asurprise
[7:14:32] iMaccaPro: so you get around 275 a week from callings alone if every calling gives valor and you get 2 epics a week right?
[7:14:35] Rinzlerr91: Ty @lazugo @tehrobtar
[7:14:39] MrGattz: @DegenerateHaven thats what we wanted. but it was to easy for blizzard to do so they didnt do it and instead they reinvented an entire new way to go about it just for fun
[7:14:44] Waffilios: how do you unlock the wandering ancient?
[7:14:48] bookooti: Where is the upgrade guy for Valor? @Towelliee
[7:14:48] ChumpsMcGee: yes on 86..... you get 15.5% below
[7:14:57] Zivs: Trees probably
[7:15:01] ctang0: %%%%
[7:15:12] Atokiri: its weird seing that the daily heroic dung didnt gave any valor whatsoever
[7:15:13] zvertdruid: like I said I think blizzard just nerfs rogues just to call it a "Update"
[7:15:16] Zivs: someone said it's the same as the pvp upgrade vendor
[7:15:21] Iamgoon: he's the same as the pvp guy
[7:15:22] Whiskey_Corin: New Venari item too btw, for 800
[7:15:30] bookooti: lol ok :D
[7:15:31] BanteringGnomes: 50 - 100 valor i bet is the cap for per run
[7:15:35] Arcaedio: I JUST GOT SOUL ASH, whoever spewing your BULLSHIT

[7:15:41] hafonix6077: 9.0.5 keystone master and pvp season 1 gone ?
[7:15:42] Xuezzi: Its the same upgrade npc's we've been using
[7:15:42] Lazugo: @bookooti U HAVE TO USE THE PVP GUY OR THE SANCTUM ONE
[7:15:46] Zivs: 800 stygia to avoid the long chains in torghast i think
[7:15:47] CritcobainTV: @Zivs nah, i used grapple and blade flurry to pull those 3 out :p
[7:15:50] notronw: Rounders
[7:15:50] Smeerzak: Teddy KGB :)
[7:15:51] NispyCriblet: The upgrade guy can now upgrade all 3 type. Anima Pvp and Pve

[7:15:55] Zivs: o i see @critcobain
[7:15:55] lel3owski: check check check
[7:15:56] Whiskey_Corin: Stygia, something about letting you see teleport points
[7:16:02] Whiskey_Corin: nerd shit
[7:16:05] griffdog125: valor in vault would have been the idea instead of shit stygia
[7:16:07] Smeerzak: God I love that movie
[7:16:08] Aquadriel: pausechamp boys
[7:16:15] tiraede: @Xuezzi Not showing that that's correct, trying to upgrade a 207 piece (just an extra in my bag) and it won't even let me put it in the slot
[7:16:19] MourvinMad: damn a rounders reference LUL

[7:20:15] sakura_2020: 225
[7:20:15] luckfore: almost 17 per key level
[7:20:23] hoodvoker: 135 / 8 is 16.8
[7:20:25] fistofnature: 10 x +10 dungeons is 1500 valor
[7:20:26] Warro726: 138/8 = 17 if the math works out like that
[7:20:27] Zarinna2015: @Towelliee Can you explain how it works? How much to actually upgrade?
[7:20:28] Shrenko: was it because you +3 the key though @Towelliee ?
[7:20:28] bmartinez50: How much for upgrade?
[7:20:29] Cyberl0c0: does getting +3 affect it?
[7:20:32] Masqerader: 16.8?
[7:20:35] BIazer1989: what key lvl was that?
[7:20:42] Iamgoon: 8

[7:20:51] jaysteea: 225
[7:20:54] geokouts: they say now at renown 39 the mount needs NO anima, so its free
[7:20:54] hoodvoker: 253
[7:20:59] ThePwnageDoctor: Hmmm stuck unable to logout without alt f4
[7:21:00] Shrenko: maybe you got more for 3 chesting the key @Towelliee ?
[7:21:04] BlackMarmalade: Do you think if you item restore a deleted 216 piece you can get it restored with the upgradable thing from M+?
[7:21:06] Jacksprat47: that is actually good
[7:21:09] Jacksprat47: for gearing alts
[7:21:18] actionbill: Now you have to do another key and +1 it for science LUL
[7:21:20] RocketMan23: 135/8 is 16.875 not an even number
[7:21:23] Aquadriel: might have to see how much you get for +2 or +3, 135 seems an odd number
[7:21:25] Warro726: @BlackMarmalade no
[7:21:28] lawgivver7: How much is it to upgrade gear?
[7:21:30] DrakeDuude: Wandering Ancient is not showing for everyone.

[7:31:34] Biheck: @Towelliee  actualy makes sens if you think about it, all upgrades cost the same not matter if it is to 200ilvl or 220, so it would be punishing for people not pushing 15++
[7:31:35] Soulsoap: Rip WoW LUL

[7:32:22] Shrenko: intended
[7:32:23] chow_yun_phap: necro banner is 275 master from tooltip

[7:33:07] Shrenko: someone on NA try do a +2 , comeon !!!
[7:33:10] srze94: u gotta do 38 dungeon runs to get capped lol
[7:33:15] Ultratide_: do a +2 real quick
[7:33:21] mandilozano: did you get wondering ancient?
[7:33:21] TheTwinnedPirates: my banner showing 400 Mastery
[7:33:30] NILLme: maybe its 135 from 2 to 10?
[7:33:35] Martuse50: he's farming top to change covs
[7:33:36] Biheck: @Towelliee upgrade costs the same from 200 or to 220 so increasing valor rewards by key level would be punishing on the people pusshing lower keys only
[7:33:37] abbosss: so working as intended?
[7:33:45] Kinghorn: LUL
[7:33:48] Velnutz: Maybe it‚Äôs like conquest and arenas. The first one is higher then the rest are a lower fixed amount

[7:34:00] srze94: 38 runs to cap?

[7:34:10] NILLme: kinda weird to get 135 from 15 and 2 :D which one would people farm hm? LUL
[7:34:13] Klauzzer: shits busted
[7:34:14] Jeraiya2: What was the PTR for LUL
[7:34:15] SonofHorus82: well I guess that means it'll be easy for people like me to get valor then.
[7:34:17] Armdel: PTR testing on live PogChamp
[7:34:25] khakifry: @Towelliee how much does it cost to upgrade something? if its like 4K to do one upgrade then that could make sense
[7:34:25] TheCliffyShow: Damn, Towelliee still on?
[7:34:26] thatguynamedjans: Honestly, it wont even matter though. YOu cant upgrade gear unless you complete all dungeons at a certain level. If homie has max valor but only has completed +5 dungeons he cant even use it. @Towelliee
[7:34:30] Zaltorr: but you need the higher keys anyways for the upgrade
[7:34:34] Sluggs_: that means abuse it now and quick

[7:35:09] CanadianHellMoose: you still want to spam the highest dungeons you can for the higher loot
[7:35:14] solsaver12: Soul Ash quest says 250 anima tho
[7:35:14] sh0tcaller615: what affix this week
[7:35:20] Darthyrevan: EU thanks you for beta testing this
[7:35:28] hooliggan: @Towelliee They probably won't fix it since it costs X amount to upgrade so if youw ant to waste that time going through  2's to get gear tehyu don't care
[7:35:32] theegoomba: oh definetely
[7:35:35] BlackMarmalade: very kick dependent

[8:15:25] mavericks312: if anything the soul cap helps with the 1k anima quest

[8:15:50] healmore49: where is the valor vendor?
[8:15:51] Theduskflyer: It‚Äôs only 37 keys to max valor
[8:15:54] Jarlan23: its her nameshake she betta respect it üò°
[8:16:05] Plague_GG: I would rather spam the high dungeon keys, because if you cap valor first you run into the situation of having bad rng and having to spam another 30 dungeons to get your trinket.
[8:16:07] Iamgoon: because over geared people will be coming to do nasty things to their keys .
[8:16:09] TheCliffyShow: Orcs & Shit? Is that an expansion? 10.0?
[8:16:12] Iamgoon: and they will let them .
[8:16:19] xvstormvx: @Towelliee at kyrian you can upgrade with the guy right next to the conduit machine

[8:19:41] TheCliffyShow: It's the slothest of all the sloths.
[8:19:49] RionLikeLion: so now you just do M0s and low M+ to get a targeted piece, and then spam +2s to get valor and upgrade it. That is the way, yes?
[8:19:50] Ezekyler: no budget for Lore videos FeelsBadMan
[8:19:52] CDubTheRIPper: danP

[8:21:07] CDubTheRIPper: im sure we'll start getting more soon LUL people are complaining\
[8:21:07] Iamgoon: you have to do 33 keys in order to cap
[8:21:09] Redpandalol: low level players
[8:21:15] Iamgoon: Who the hell would want to do that?
[8:21:27] Maydie6066: i mean the valor itself wont being jack if you dont get KSC/KSM right? so who cares if you can cap it with 2's if you cant upgrade any gear lol

[8:23:12] arcanine01: valor is capped, upgrading a m+2 item takes like 3-4k valor, thats too much
[8:23:19] Threatslive: 15 boosts bout to be lit...i should join a team

[8:25:45] Kimonosos: true
[8:25:48] Mogwaimonk: since this reset, Ive had 3 seperate updates
[8:25:50] cahoots82: If you think it's easy to do KSM for the average player you're not seeing the absolute BANK boosters are making
[8:25:53] Iamgoon: if you have to pug 90 percent of the time. KSM isn't the easiest thing to do in the world.
[8:25:54] Jarlan23: youd be suprised i think. some people only run like 1 5+ each week
[8:25:55] LandoGriffinPHD: what is KSM
[8:25:55] Maego1: at least weaker players have reason to become better and practice :)
[8:26:07] JiveDude: Its bad, if you can only play a couple hours each week. You know real life
[8:26:13] nimphtv: i need 3 more 15s for ksm
[8:26:13] ScriptzSB: Its not that easy lol
[8:26:17] s0kana: It's not
[8:26:27] KnsWoW: do you have to time the 15s?
[8:26:29] Sneakiel0l: KSM is harder then Heroic raid.. and yet ... we are rewarded for less gear
[8:26:32] BubbaChubbs420: i dont like mythic + so getting KSM sucks
[8:26:33] JiveDude: Im at +9's

[9:13:18] rasury123: what is cap lvl now on wow
[9:13:36] obviouslythe3rd: question for the big dick pvp players in chat, is ww monk or ret pala better for low tier pvp? (pushing up to glad, not any higher).  And what are your predictions for after 9.0.5
[9:13:48] AltDaniBB: yeah just farm 12's, its 207 ilvl
[9:14:06] GenMysters: What sucks about the vault is you get penalized for doing low keys. You can complete 10 M= and if 1 is a 4 you get a 4 as a choice 100%. So I do not help guild members anymore  because of it.  Blizzard created a system which causes people to not include lesser   players.
[9:14:07] Kinghorn: cap is probably around 230?
[9:14:10] Kinghorn: max ilvl
[9:14:43] Masqerader: DOS gonna be the most farmed dungeon I think, those 2 trinkets lol
[9:14:52] rasury123: nice to know thinks guys
[9:14:59] Specsifier: I'm capable of like 5s. I have friends who can carry me through 15s LUL
[9:15:04] TheUnknowing: Yeah, if you dont have KSM your goal should probably be to get it
[9:15:12] MrGattz: banned
[9:15:13] BrotherBrent: no
[9:15:13] AltDaniBB: yaeh the cube and the tank trinket
[9:15:24] Masqerader: not yet
[9:15:29] binlizzle: Yep
[9:15:30] Creative_Pigeon: oh man did illidan crash?
[9:15:35] MrGattz: cant be talking shit about blizzard, they hear all
[9:15:36] bjg1889: Yep
[9:15:43] Javydachamp: its cause u talked about blizzards ret pallys
[9:15:44] rasury123: m m m intristing
[9:15:45] subversv: im fine on illidan
[9:15:45] Mr_Pennywise_: :p
[9:15:54] Putcride: not yet
[9:16:04] abbosss: wait what happened?
[9:16:11] Creative_Pigeon: DoS is terrible too
[9:16:18] GenMysters: Have both of those trinkets over 220 already.  All my vault gives me are trinkets which at this point are worthless.
[9:16:34] abbosss: oh jeez, i thought they were rolling back valor or something LUL
[9:16:35] Stonepatterson2: how do u get the tree mount?
[9:16:38] abbosss: they are LUL
[9:16:43] Masqerader: lol
[9:16:59] Sollice: Nice got a Dreadfire Vessel from vault
[9:17:05] Masqerader: they took all the chains from revendreth and put them in torghast
[9:17:18] rasury123: probably take long time get to this lvl
[9:17:35] dpruss00: chains been like that since release
[9:17:39] droli: @Stonepatterson2  promo item, you nshould get one for having shadowlands, may take a couple days but youll get it
[9:17:46] RoboMaximillion: lol
[9:17:54] Mogwaimonk: #Working as Intended
[9:18:10] dkapocalypse: world of fucked up LOL
[9:18:26] abbosss: i wish you could use the first on the venthyr
[9:18:32] Reklusion: Yellow is food - Red is drink @Towelliee
[9:18:32] abbosss: just for shits and giggles
[9:18:38] dpruss00: dont report it we need all the dev time on 9.1 lol
[9:19:11] SonofHorus82: so I actually just had fun in the maw, probably because I haven't dont it in months.
[9:19:11] Ganondalf1337: did you do a m+ already? do we know how many valor points you get for m+`? _D
[9:19:12] rasury123: the deals is the more the 1 character that take more time
[9:19:13] GenMysters: I  do mists like 4-5 times a week at +12-15 never see weapon or shield drop out of there. Yesterday my off tank ran  with me Shield dropped for him on M15 could not trade it  because blizzard is stupid.
[9:19:42] gamer_eighteen: Where do we spend VP? Same NPC as where you exchange gear for tokens at your covenant base?
[9:20:32] RodneyIsPro: has anyone not completed a key, how much valor?
[9:20:53] micha3lsc0tt: 135 valor on all keys
[9:20:54] Specsifier: I mean, to be fair, PvPers got shafted HARD for the last several expansions.
[9:20:54] rasury123: the good can use old gear work to
[9:21:04] zacpuentes: whats the health bars ur using?
[9:21:08] Khlaro: @Towelliee You think they're gonna add Legion to TW rotation?
[9:21:19] GenMysters: Valor is 220 You still need to get the gear to drop upgrade it.
[9:21:44] instant_savage: did they not give the tree to everyone?
[9:22:10] A_New_Challenger: I am looking at mythic gear right now from prior to today and not showing a upgrade level on it (already at 200 ilvl)
[9:22:16] RoboMaximillion: bulling the whole area lol
[9:22:18] A_New_Challenger: *an
[9:22:25] connnelkiely: @instant_savage its rolled out periodically so they dont destroy their servers i think
[9:22:26] Darthyrevan: it was a shit show....obviously
[9:22:31] rasury123: can enchanted the old gear works
[9:22:34] Mogwaimonk: have to turn them in
[9:22:36] civiljawner: Glad I finished ksm last week
[9:22:47] Ganondalf1337: Does anyone know how much valor you get from m+?
[9:22:57] geokouts: other side of bridge
[9:22:59] shimwood: I hate this quest, the NPC is some dumb location
[9:23:00] GenMysters: @Towelliee so you cap out in valor. You get 0 drops and your vault gets 1 item 226 WHat are you upgrading?
[9:23:16] Khlaro: Pog! They added a mailbox by the bank in Oribos! Best thing about the patch
[9:23:45] Masqerader: hand of archon

[9:24:29] ZeethianDragon: no thanks. I like my brawler title ty LUL
[9:24:32] GenMysters: exactly
[9:24:33] Exxcar: This week's vault also can't be upgraded
[9:24:40] A_New_Challenger: I heard there isn't a valor cap...confirmed?
[9:24:46] Scarhearth: i got 2 junky 226 items in my vault... one was a mistcaller ocarina and the other a crit/mastery cloak
[9:25:04] GenMysters: Well I am still waiting for the gear i need Kind of sucks
[9:25:33] zaraine1: and i wanted to farm PF this wekk... 15s.. fuck me
[9:25:35] theberserkviking: woooo just got my wandering ancient! it looks so good
[9:25:55] GenMysters: This is only so  people that play 300 alts have somehting to make them feel good.
[9:25:58] TheGiant99: Broken gasme
[9:26:02] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: Altoholic here
[9:26:23] A_New_Challenger: I think you can just start collecting valor running whatever you want and then when you finally want that piece you either already got it or go grind it, but I think they said no cap so you are able to run whatever you want and not worry about getting the item prior to the valor cap
[9:26:32] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I only have healer :D
[9:26:33] BlackMarmalade: you can mash that package drop btw
[9:26:36] BlackMarmalade: get 2 in 1
[9:26:44] lieutenantdan416: where is the valor npc at
[9:26:45] EliteChefLoki: i mean if you have terrible luck with rng like i do this system is great you just have to get lucky once for bis Kappa
[9:26:48] shimwood: Does Valor need to be spent on 9.0.5 gear or can we hoarde it until 9.1?
[9:26:49] LadyJasmin: then there's chad
[9:26:59] geokouts: WQ give valor?

[9:29:29] GenMysters: If you could purchase the gear you want with valor then that would be worth it.  Make the amount of valor attainable over several weeks and then you have something there.
[9:29:30] Keyastaron_: i got a insta click mpuse and i get the quest done in 1 spot Kappa
[9:29:41] Sovekz: Isn't mists or halls the easiest?
[9:29:44] BlackMarmalade: id say halls
[9:30:11] brucezhu: NW might be fastest with weapons
[9:30:35] Shrenko: WTS +2 keys
[9:31:08] rasury123: that not that good
[9:31:34] TheGaoSora: 10g
[9:31:59] Shrenko: D:
[9:32:01] dpruss00: they just need it if you complete a 15 key you unlock the max upgrades
[9:32:02] chrslp: Thats a lame title LUL
[9:32:10] TheGaoSora: minmaxer DansGame
[9:32:21] chrslp: Should be Champion of Bastion
[9:32:27] Sovekz: At least as Venthyr I can be a Count
[9:32:44] rasury123: never good enough for the gear always new gear never good
[9:32:52] civiljawner: @dpruss00 that‚Äôs too easy lol
[9:32:52] Strik3r019: but ksm isnt for casuals tho
[9:32:59] Lynxide: what is ksm?
[9:32:59] Scarhearth: so do you need KSM for your alts too for valor ?
[9:33:02] EliteChefLoki: either ease up on requirements or they slowly nerf the dungeons to be doable by the casuals
[9:33:11] N3llee: cheves are boa
[9:33:14] civiljawner: Ksm is account wide
[9:33:14] Creative_Pigeon: honestly KSC should be 220s since you get 220+ gear after 10s
[9:33:18] TowersOverYou: is it a good time to get into the xpac i played the last one at the end and it was fun
[9:33:20] TheGaoSora: lets hope no one is stupid enough to do that...
[9:33:21] chrslp: Blizzard adding tokens was a great decision financially LUL
[9:33:30] racketpunch: sounds like they'd rather go the token route if those are their options
[9:33:41] TheGaoSora: besides whales..
[9:33:41] TheGiant99: Its like just give every body access to the loot. why gate it?
[9:33:45] GenMysters: This game always caters to the ALT crowd. Catchup crowd and makes the mains farm and  farm and farm and farm. This is why people get burned out and they lose subs.
[9:33:46] buffility: @TowersOverYou if you can bear the last patch of bfa you can enjoy SL easily
[9:33:46] civiljawner: Last week was the week to get ksm, very easy
[9:33:53] dpruss00: theres no boosts for ksm with token there all doing it for real money currently
[9:33:56] Strik3r019: why would a casual need 220+ gear if ther are not mythic raiding? to what quest fster?
[9:34:03] Nitrosulphur: I just got my KSM today and im happy
[9:34:05] rasury123: always new gear the need change
[9:34:06] TowersOverYou: @buffility i will give it a try =D
[9:34:29] wmadsen: I am a casual, my gear is 211, I want better gear to help my guild progress.
[9:34:36] Aidler: yeah it‚Äòs crazy. no way I‚Äòd ever pay more then 50 bucks for KSM
[9:34:36] bigjld: How much valor you get for 1 dungeon
[9:34:46] feherlofia123: sadge
[9:34:46] TheGaoSora: when a single timed +15 is more than a single token, that's a ripoff if only people understand that..
[9:34:59] danthepancake: Strik3r019 for the same reason mythic raiders want gear - because thats the whole point of rpgs, to get your character stronger?
[9:34:59] brucezhu: @Jerman481 135 for any key level
[9:35:00] dpruss00: stimulus money ppl will be buying ksm
[9:35:12] dpruss00: have super bads with ilvl 220 messing up ppl keys lol
[9:35:19] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  back in legion someone got a 945 IN LFR
[9:35:23] FatChase: Glad I got KSM last week, can grind my alts some 220 gear
[9:35:23] rasury123: that is true but is hard to get gear
[9:35:25] Keyastaron_: titanforge
[9:35:29] FrankTizzle: I miss titanforging FeelsBadMan
[9:35:30] Aidler: then it‚Äòs good that I will get no stimulus money towLul
[9:35:35] GenMysters: @dpruss00 exactly that.
[9:35:35] TheGaoSora: hopefully, people will wait...
[9:35:58] feherlofia123: smart as in . lets give them the worst affixes to try out this new feature
[9:36:00] wah7767: KSM paid for by joe biden
[9:36:05] TowersOverYou: whats your main tank?
[9:36:11] Lazugo: I want to play my Dk with your warrior @Towelliee
[9:36:23] kroknows101: yeah, I have a 218 paladin join a +9 HoA. Dude didn't even know to take the adds on the canister on High Adjudicator... gear doesn't mean a thing.

[9:56:53] Eastpak3: i have never played WoW, is it hard to get into now?
[9:57:18] smashwow: can't remember
[9:57:40] smashwow: i think it has a max duration but they've reworked it so many times
[9:57:47] Shrenko: @Eastpak3 nope not really! they just came out with a nice new player expericence tutorial
[9:58:11] smashwow: and with the lvl squish it's not bad
[9:58:12] Artivicii: @Eastpak3 not exactly hard, but its less casual than the last 3 expansions
[9:58:13] Eastpak3: @Shrenko ok, do i need any expansions?
[9:58:47] Armdel: the only expansion you need is usually the latest one, the rest is free with the sub
[9:59:04] Shrenko: @Eastpak3 what Armdel said ^
[9:59:24] Armdel: so you don't have to buy it right away, you try the game out with just a sub first, then buy the latest expansion when you hit that level
[9:59:37] Shrenko: @Armdel pretty much
[10:01:48] foobis_25: do u get 135 valor regardless of the level of the key?
