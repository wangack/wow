[0:04:36] shadowkattey: no one trusts aug
[0:05:11] nixar1: heyo, why only 720p on twitch? or is it just me
[0:05:19] KIC_846: aug is a coin flip. even in the 3.6k range:/
[0:05:31] nixar1: i see
[0:05:56] KommanderKoa: Yup, refreched the page and got 1080p
[0:06:04] KinetixTTV: why does hpal feel so bad right now in keys !

[0:06:34] ren0m: Happy birthday! Did you manage to fit all the candles on a cake?
[0:06:37] nixar1: hyped for tuning after mdi
[0:06:50] nixar1: surely
[0:07:02] zebracak35: 5 Mill gold, did someone do some carries offline? XD
[0:07:22] KIC_846: on wednesday invited an aug for my BRH, and after the first pack ive noticed he last second re-specced to dev, and had no enrage removal.. was so close to quit my own key
[0:07:34] sylareon: what's up with the 720p?
[0:07:42] sylareon: refreshing didn't fix it for me
[0:08:09] ren0m: It goes to 720p for me as well
[0:10:40] Orhova: morning @jdotb
[0:10:45] AbieCherry: no 1080p ?

[0:13:33] Fracture93: fuck that maze though
[0:13:44] bremek0: For me, healing is better when I have more crit than mastery @jdotb does this make sense?
[0:13:55] Guarok: That whole gauntlet is so bad.  Sometimes I very clearly got hit and I'm fine.  Sometimes I don't get hit by anything and it sends me back.  It makes no sense.
[0:15:08] flawlesslykun: ye i only have 720p aswell

[0:19:26] bojackhorseman2004: and in what scenarios?
[0:19:27] bojackhorseman2004: thanks you
[0:19:39] frazlord: @bojackhorseman2004 in raid
[0:19:45] bojackhorseman2004: i mean for m+
[0:19:53] KommanderKoa: Never in M+
[0:20:02] bojackhorseman2004: really?
[0:20:09] frazlord: Really really
[0:20:13] KommanderKoa: The ROI isn't worth it
[0:20:24] bojackhorseman2004: Hmm but i see in top builds people are taking cultivation
[0:20:31] bojackhorseman2004: which is a rejuvination talent
[0:20:47] caradea_: only for specific scenarios or because they need the node to go further down
[0:20:51] bojackhorseman2004: ROI what does that mean?
[0:21:08] bojackhorseman2004: you can take the node for 20 sec less cd on ironbark
[0:21:11] bojackhorseman2004: or cultivation
[0:21:23] bojackhorseman2004: and allot of people pick cultivation i am seeing on archon and raider io
[0:21:34] bojackhorseman2004: in 30s
[0:21:35] frazlord: ROI is return on investment. It's just not worth pressing
[0:21:42] bojackhorseman2004: oh okey
[0:22:17] frazlord: You take cult to get to unstoppable growth

[0:24:15] Guarok: Awwwww they're thinking of you
[0:24:17] devilhawk83: adeentHuh Something is going on
[0:24:50] caradea_: @bojackhorseman2004 there are a few scenarios where you need to pump single target healing and that extra mastery stack will help, but you dont use rejuv as part of your rotation
[0:24:51] moodmonger: They ran out of money you paid 10 years ago

[2:37:43] SAMBBA1: @weedyy22 thanks, your comment made my day, and trust me i've had the worst day ever.
[2:37:44] delacourtv: Do you wrath and port since it has travel time?
[2:37:54] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[2:38:55] delacourtv: Can you drop ursol's and drag it out of ursol's to trigger the grip back?
[2:39:07] thatbassist: as long as you meld after wrath is cast but before it hits
[2:39:08] Squizzed: you can't meld with one up you go right back into combat
[2:39:09] SeargentFish: Ursols doesnt trigger combat

[2:39:19] anaya909: i've failed the skip at end of motherlode just from ysera's gift healing people running through
[2:39:27] delacourtv: I know the initial drop of it doesn't.  I wasn't sure if the gripping back in of ursol's would trigger combat
[2:39:35] anaya909: druid just wants to be in combat
[2:39:38] Oracle_WoW: cant you cast wrath, get in combat, meld during travel time, take gate, wrath does damage and gets you in combat again. @jdotb
[2:39:42] SeargentFish: U can wrath >meld > port > wrath hits
[2:40:28] SAMBBA1: has the stream always been 720p?

[2:45:49] Guffels: there is something to be said about giving each 1 seed from the Cup a By for finals
[2:45:53] weedyy22: @SeargentFish what does have that to do with precast on bosses? i just tested it and after the cast u get into combat and when u meld in traveltime once wrath hits u wont come into combat
[2:46:18] SeargentFish: Did u leave meld while midair?
[2:46:33] Guarok: I don't hear that
[2:46:44] MangoPlays_: Its not super bad but it is noticable
[2:46:51] SeargentFish: On bosses if u prewrath u dont get combat until it hits
[2:46:54] Twin029: @Guarok never? :O
[2:47:10] Guarok: I just cranked up my volume and I don't hear it at all
[2:47:20] caradea_: ^same
[2:47:35] Guarok: Oh, there it is
[2:47:37] MangoPlays_: happening now
[2:47:41] weedyy22: @SeargentFish yes i did move in traveltime before it hits u dont get into combat
[2:47:42] SevzyYEP: I can't hear white noise either but I'm half deaf because I'm old so.. FeelsWeirdMan
[2:47:47] Guarok: Not anymore
[2:47:51] MangoPlays_: stopped when you talked
[2:47:55] iiconiicz: White noise is there when you dont talk for a minute
[2:47:59] Funkytree: Ye I see 720 max

[2:48:01] MangoPlays_: But now its happening
[2:48:01] caradea_: ohh yeah
[2:48:03] iiconiicz: and then comes back
[2:48:17] Twin029: fuck yea im not stupid :D
[2:48:17] Guarok: It's feedback
[2:48:18] SevzyYEP: jam them cables in brother
[2:48:32] weedyy22: @SeargentFish also on bosses once your wrath cast is done you are in combat
[2:48:51] Guarok: I hear feedback a little while after you go silent.
[2:49:22] SeargentFish: The boss doesnt pull tho, so the mob cannot be put into combat until wrath hits
[2:49:27] sacresacred: James is cooking
[2:49:36] flawlesslykun: BRO A FUCKING MACHINE GUN ?
[2:49:38] delacourtv: They didn't run mushroom
[2:49:42] weedyy22: @SeargentFish but you are in combat and the enemy will once it hits

[2:50:01] MangoPlays_: Is it possible he melds after the dots and ports between ticks?
[2:50:02] Guarok: Not happening now.  You must have tweaked something and got rid of it.
[2:50:14] weedyy22: @SeargentFish thats how the game works
[2:50:30] SeargentFish: No cuz u drop combat when that mob loses aggro of u
[2:50:54] weedyy22: well it does either u believe it or not
[2:50:55] Crystallize007: maybe if  we don't understand how combat works in wow we don't have to say what we think about it
[2:51:32] MangoPlays_: Then no one would talk except devs

[2:52:30] weedyy22: @SeargentFish u also cant cast wrath on anything friendly so it just triggers your combat and when it hits triggers combat for the target
[2:53:11] sacresacred: Should have brought a healerLOLW
[2:54:00] Oracle_WoW: @weedyy22 combat triggers work different in different places
[2:54:12] aurochz: jpc tech WICKED
[2:54:24] flawlesslykun: that is a fucking pull ngl
[2:54:24] Charm_pit: without healer hahaha
[2:54:46] weedyy22: @Oracle_WoW and is often buggy so yeah ... probably not the cleanest code
[2:55:22] iiconiicz: white noise back
[2:55:28] Oracle_WoW: i think thats why people are confused with cast success triggering combat. they are used to raid where cast success doesnt appear to start combat
[2:55:42] flawlesslykun: LMAO
[2:55:49] aurochz: KEKW Zaelia just built diff

[2:56:11] Guffels: ok this actually feels like not having a healer is pretty risky
[2:56:14] weedyy22: @Oracle_WoW spaghettt code
[2:56:25] sacresacred: Its a ghost
[2:56:26] Guarok: I didn't hear it then
[2:56:28] monntuu: i didnt hear it lol

[2:56:37] Surarn: @Oracle_WoW think the druid is in combat as soon as wrath is finished so its the same?
[2:56:54] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:57:01] sw0ngs: this is great.... 4dps getting punished so hard
[2:57:18] MrSpicyJ: poor 4 dps comps
[2:57:26] Oracle_WoW: @Surarn right but on cast success pre pull a boss doesnt start meleeing people. in a dungeon on cast success that mob is coming for you on cast success, before damage is done
[2:57:39] Celissah: Is it BO3 or BO5?
[2:57:42] Guarok: Heard it right before you started talking for like half a second.  It's definitely feedback but not sure what setting might be causing it.
[2:57:54] Surarn: @Oracle_WoW cast success doesnt cause mobs to attack you in the wild either so its the same
[2:58:09] Oracle_WoW: right, raid is the outlier people are confused by
[2:58:10] MangoPlays_: Are ppl playing 4 dps in pugs? I havent played since like week 4 of this season
[2:58:12] sacresacred: Furry dwarfs Kreygasm
[2:58:15] AGuyWithPants: echo gate

[2:58:46] SevzyYEP: pls Echo full wipe Prayge
[2:58:55] weedyy22: so combat trigger is a spaghetty code CONFIRMED

[2:58:59] AGuyWithPants: ECHO DIFF
[2:59:02] chaigy: WHAT IS THAT
[2:59:06] aurochz: LMAO
[2:59:26] Surarn: @Oracle_WoW So you're saying a cast success wrath puts you in combat AND the mob aggro you instantly?
[2:59:31] Surarn: Because i call bullshit on that
[2:59:39] Surarn: The mob aggro you when wrath hits it
[2:59:48] weedyy22: how to win mdi? be the best abuser and bugfinder xD
[2:59:55] devilhawk83: adeentHmm Gingi
[2:59:56] SeargentFish: Back when u prepotted did u do it before or after wrath?
[3:00:20] weedyy22: @SeargentFish before u enter combat
[3:00:22] chaigy: ok that pull was insane
[3:00:56] Guffels: feels good to see some tech in this boring key
[3:00:58] devilhawk83: yep
[3:01:03] Crystallize007: @Surarn you are correct btw
[3:01:20] Surarn: @SeargentFish create a lvl 1 nelf druid, wrath (get put in combat) -> meld (get out of combat) -> move so you arent invis -> wrath hits (you get put in combat)
[3:01:39] SeargentFish: I cant do that atm

[3:03:48] Surarn: @Crystallize007 is this basic stuff for a rdruid? ^^
[3:03:55] iiconiicz: I thought we saw a team like low 11 time this boss and 1 phase last boss
[3:04:27] MrSpicyJ: it was different affixes
