[0:20:34] wreck561: spooky but it'll allow for some cool new things to happen
[0:20:36] Connelley_: the cuts and eveything its kinda crazy
[0:20:45] GregWasTaken: bros on a cloud
[0:20:57] TobyNova: Images like that mixed with Apple Vision Pro is kinda scary haha
[0:21:00] highonacidd: gg we had a good run
[0:21:04] trevsee: LETS BUILD CABINS BOYS
[0:21:16] Connelley_: I'm gonna bet sub 2 years there'll be a feature film all AI
[0:21:19] GregWasTaken: guys, launch yourselves into the sun
[0:21:20] miloxz: did you see the class tuning?
[0:21:20] Hani_Senpai: So what's your apocalypse plan Soni?

[0:23:01] SONII: https://x.com/sonii/status/1758231239994278326?s=20
[0:23:14] TobyNova: Well written man, hopefully it gets more traction and things change <3
[0:23:21] miloxz: probobly will say warriors are fine like before
[0:23:35] NawtyTyme: it is very well written
[0:23:45] 8thwndrmusic: spear of bastion is sooooooooooo retail please now
[0:23:47] Connelley_: No no I agree its well written its just deserved rant
[0:23:47] 8thwndrmusic: no
[0:23:58] Winttyrr: "we've been closely monitoring warcraft logs. warriors are fine."
[0:24:00] TobyNova: Yeh it's to the point with lots of good points
[0:24:10] Jacco89: People saying Warrior is OP are clueless
[0:24:11] Jacco89: literally
[0:24:14] binoboy95: YOOO Sonii, How was ur day today ?
[0:24:32] killanyoux: think its sword from RFD
[0:24:35] BIEM491: They argued at 60 they were op I said great so they have to wait 6 months to have fun
[0:24:47] oasa92: its nightblade not from rfd
[0:24:54] TobyNova: One last thing about ai stuff, you seen this? https://www.instagram.com/fit_aitana/?hl=en
[0:24:56] oasa92: epic 2h
[0:25:11] Nahno: @BIEM491 Same, so might as well not even level warrior until last phase
[0:25:32] tyresemicah: What are yuou running uldaman for?
[0:25:37] Selecktt: Cheer500 They already have the tools to make warrior feel better. Cataclysm arms spec is just wotlk anger management+endless rage rune. Give us the passive rage gen so we dont have to start every encounter with 5 auto attacks.
[0:25:49] drvichyssoise: i cant get enough rage in pvp cause i die to fast
[0:25:52] woodstop22: Hey Sonii, do other people see you as undead or is just you since you changed your appearance?

[0:31:56] ashryn1307: i agree with him how Enshrouded is better than Valheim
[0:31:57] Winttyrr: forgot about that
[0:31:59] Denat0: revelosh drops plate boots
[0:32:03] murloc_kingkiller: @SONII would you ever play retail?

[0:33:20] Vycras: I last played Legion and skipped BFA and SL, came for DF and enjoyed it
[0:33:20] theboushy: i loved shadowlands <3
[0:33:21] Rynnko: Hmm I played DF way more than SL
[0:33:24] FinestGoldy: Good early evening
[0:33:26] OrganikCum: i played dragonflight for 3 day lol
[0:33:26] Winttyrr: i dont think im buying war within
[0:33:27] pr_lly: stopped retail after wod
[0:33:31] Denat0: honestly played dragonflight the most out of the last three expansions
[0:33:32] Winttyrr: i will not get my moneys worth out of it
[0:33:33] Wolfinosg: shadowlands and BFA was 1 month for me and dragonflight about 2 weeks tops
[0:33:34] Connelley_: SOD is growing on me more. But i'll always enjoy retail arena
[0:33:37] tyresemicah: No point playing retail when you gotta sit in a 2 hour solo shuffle que
[0:33:38] quttersraga: u tried to play with the -rage on belt?
[0:33:39] miloxz: mythic+ seems fun
[0:33:47] Vycras: DF is well received and much better than SL (according to the majority)
[0:33:53] Volryn: Yup 󠀀
[0:33:54] murloc_kingkiller: i like the infinite scaling mythic+
[0:33:54] OrganikCum: same, im a classic only player now
[0:34:01] trevsee: Dragonflight was too disney to me
[0:34:07] rayncoat_: song?
[0:34:08] Winttyrr: DF is so fuckin soft
[0:34:09] rayncoat_: im jammin
[0:34:10] TheseDaysLIVE: They spoiling the next 3 expansions makes it boring
[0:34:11] Connelley_: That's dissapointing to hear :(
[0:34:11] Slymmetrical: I just log in once a month to do trading post, and that's it
[0:34:15] Blakeasuarus: dragon tales dragons
[0:34:41] Skrimij_: I heard it took shadowlands almost a year to receive a major patch
[0:34:44] Connelley_: your retail war gameplay was best for arena pvp
[0:34:49] lukelalonde: is your brother also a streamer?
[0:34:51] Rynnko: S1 Outlaw rogue was the funniest spec I've ever played
[0:34:52] VNNI: It's too early to say. We've basically only seen some zones

[0:36:37] Wolfinosg: @SONII i mean when you do the M+ weekly and raid there is nothing to do after so its normal
[0:36:37] miloxz: will cata servers go off from wotlk?
[0:36:41] miloxz: or will it be fresh
[0:36:45] CSmitty917: can someone tell me how sonii got the kodo?

[0:55:36] DadRage: why the shit can't I pin that
[0:55:38] WintersWolfcry: Anyone playing a SoD warlock? Id love to hear your thoughts on it. It's feeling entirely lackluster to me. Like the damage in PvE is fine, but PvP feels pretty awful outside of some 1v1's.
[0:55:39] nowheretoday: Op
[0:55:42] Selecktt: Legion bloodthirst costs no rage, and generates 8.
[0:55:48] SkapoozZ: @SONII yeh, ideleted the game.. but bcs i am addicted i downloaded it right after again .lol
[0:55:57] girlz__: u need diamond flask

[0:56:24] TobyNova: @girlz__ ha flask set would be pretty funny in ph2
[0:56:29] Jo3bab3: Im surprised they did not introduce BS in p2 for warriors
[0:56:35] mart_york: aren’t you concerned if you give warriors utility etc that we’ll end up with retail and class homogenous. I don’t want tanks outhealing the healers
[0:56:35] RitanRitual: RitanRitual subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Hell yeah zaddy
[0:56:38] Skrimij_: thought the utility banner idea was cool, intervening to it
[0:57:00] girlz__: @TobyNova yeah then u gotta steal +healing items from clothies xD
[0:57:04] orphesis: I’ll always remember jamming this and Korn in twink pvp back in TBC
[0:57:04] draingg: i am very bad at warrior but what is the reason to switch between battle and berserking stance?
[0:57:17] TobyNova: @girlz__ Streamer bennies though :)

[0:58:44] Balg32: I wish... Im 26 and the kids in my gym call me sir...
[0:58:54] Selecktt: Telling you man, blacksmithing helm is the move. +50 all resist. paired with a potion you get +100 allresist. it's pretty nutty
[0:59:09] Stoneybaby: getting 100 helmets before pendulum drops LUL
[0:59:45] Selecktt: 100 resist at 40 is like 40% resist
[1:00:15] SkapoozZ: @SONII shadow priest is like a trigger word atm. i hate the dmg they got
[1:00:50] miloxz: shaman gonna pop off
[1:00:53] Winttyrr: this song was on NFS: Carbon. loved that game
[1:01:06] Wolfinosg: @SONII anything interesting with the professions yet? or not bothered at all

[1:01:52] dustywright: nice
[1:02:05] draingg: Okey, thank you! i play warrior on retail but it's nothing like classic/ SOD. if we talking stance.
[1:02:08] Tyfonius: ele shaman rune got a bug fix too
[1:02:08] Stoneybaby: @Winttyrr could never beat the r8 at the end for some reason
[1:02:10] miloxz: The Dual-Wield Specialization rune now provides 50% bonus damage to your offhand weapon swings.
[1:02:33] ajeazy84: I wish they put achievments in SoD
[1:02:37] tomzi1: 3% crit vs 10% ms
[1:02:44] Unframed_: A nerf across all runes is needed to get closer to even out the playfield. That or give war a hard hitting rune skill aswell
[1:02:47] Winttyrr: @Stoneybaby i struggled on my muscle playthroughs, and exotic was tough, but if you did tuner runs it was easy af
[1:02:58] Winttyrr: skyline at the end was nutty

[1:04:00] mc_spanky_: @SONII can you show me your spec when you get a chance
[1:04:18] Tyfonius: lock tanks spam searing pain, not really auto attacking at all
[1:04:26] mc_spanky_: thanks bro
[1:04:27] wograine: arms talents are better for pve too?
[1:04:30] mc_spanky_: i was curious to see a full arms build
[1:04:42] mc_spanky_: what about for tanking?
[1:04:46] whd123: for the bleeds
[1:04:51] Slyz777: arms

[1:06:33] D3KHAR: You're never getting Pendulum lol, people have farmed it since the dawn of time and never gotten it
[1:06:47] lebvaa: ty sonii for the post on warrior problems currently, blizzard needs to do something fast as we know phase 3 runes and they are not impressing, lets hope we get major changes.
[1:06:53] Winttyrr: apparently flameweavers are one of the troggs
[1:06:55] pr_lly: stonevault flameweavers are troggs
[1:07:15] draingg: When SOD reach phase 3 will that mean 60? and if so will that not just be like classic again?
[1:07:20] tomzi1: @D3KHAR he is a streamer tho

[2:30:41] lampsterof79: I keep getting layered and goin solo frommy group.  I dont think I even got 50 there.  I would jkust kill someone near a shrine then turnin because it was instant murder
[2:30:44] Sqwibbie: @SONII warrior and mage feel a bit weak to me
[2:31:18] Hayzed0ut: Hayzed0ut subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months!

[2:34:24] yarrpeter: I picked warlock because tanking as a lock sounded fun. It just happened to be good too. Fun > FotM
[2:34:26] Sqwibbie: Its more the design of constantly being oom after a relatively short fight that i don't like.
[2:34:30] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: like warlocks not op

[3:52:53] handy_grenade: next to nothing
[3:52:59] Truusce: A related term appears in the Bible (Job 19:20), where Job says, “I am escaped with the skin of my teeth,” presumably meaning he got away with nothing at all.

[3:54:29] ooTHExTUBEoo: Warriors clearly need to be nerfed, they can wear plate armor! Broken!
[3:54:32] MrThreePik: maybe there's no gap between your skin and teeth, meaning close call?
[3:54:50] MilesofOsiris: can we see gear at some point?

[4:28:00] choochiiee: the mana right now is horrible. the damage isnt terrible
[4:28:03] prowlerx: mage is always good every single expansion
[4:28:06] kostax96: warrior num 1 for pve, rogue num 1 for pvp, not casters
[4:28:07] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: THING ABOUT MAGE IS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY
[4:28:10] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: oops caps

[4:28:53] xdyabolical: i play boomy, i felt that we were op but i think the nerf was done wrong
[4:28:53] miciahclay: shadow priests know their class is op :)
[4:28:57] Megarachnid: im just good bro
[4:28:58] Undankable: always greener on the other side of then fence
[4:28:59] miciahclay: can confirm
[4:28:59] Coriem_: Hunters and Locks can't think that
[4:29:01] kostax96: priest is op we can all agree
[4:29:07] phreakzyo: Why is every moonkin crying about the starsurge nerf that shit was broken dumb op
[4:29:08] FUSenh: brother i play spriest, nobody is delusional enough to say this isnt op
[4:29:08] benbreezi: hunters know
[4:29:32] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: mage had a one shot endgame classic
[4:29:36] kostax96: blashemy , druid nerf was not nesessery, its usless now as before
[4:29:39] Fuskigare: shadowpriest totally broken
[4:29:39] hullkki: shadow word death kills from 40% hp
[4:29:39] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: and that was never gunna get fixed
[4:29:42] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: same with rogue
[4:29:44] boostedeg93: shadow priest is gigga OP
[4:29:47] outofmanax: srsly tho, as of now in SoD, warrior is in the most balanced powerlvl out of trhe classes
[4:29:50] Coriem_: Melee Hunter is nuts right now too
[4:29:53] miciahclay: rogues do body spriest pretty often tho, but spriest is still busted lol
[4:30:03] Winttyrr: how tf is enraged regen as weak as it is, AND a 3 min cd? lol
[4:30:11] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: lol\
[4:30:16] kostax96: @FUSenh how was it op, 1k crit, when shadow word death crit for 1.7k easy?
[4:30:30] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: i mena war is alright i guess
[4:30:36] kngkoji: i wanna see some a bunch of 1v1's
[4:30:40] kngkoji: then we'll know
[4:30:43] Cryptikwow: lol
[4:30:43] Nooshbag98: thats been me for the past 3 hours
[4:30:45] veiloflonelystars: he probably means well balanced as in how most classes should be
[4:30:52] iPlayCuzFun: thats my experience
[4:30:54] iPlayCuzFun: and it aint nice
[4:30:55] suciopotterxd: can u show weapon pls
[4:30:55] outofmanax: I mean we have SPs pressing 1 global instant cast deleting people xD
[4:30:56] retox248: WoW is so much banter between classes its to funny man
[4:30:59] kostax96: priest should be nerfed to the ground
[4:31:15] KairuruTV: this is vanilla, NOT retail, they dont balance around level 40 raid parses guys
[4:31:17] Selecktt: Our refreshing twist was the same thing as before but 25% more number
[4:31:20] Megarachnid: we all get to complain about new things :)
[4:31:28] Fhrostitute: YES
[4:31:29] Slowwolf17: I wouldnt cry about heroic leap
[4:31:37] Unbound_Entity: 100
[4:31:40] Winttyrr: Sonii1g
[4:31:43] kostax96: @KnetikTV they do not balance around 60 too, they balance around current level, and they are failing
[4:31:43] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: True
[4:31:43] Slowwolf17: or heroic throw with the sunder
[4:31:45] ObeySpite: defenitly Never back down playlist haha
[4:31:45] pitviiper: QQ
[4:32:01] don_kneee: atleast u not a boomie
[4:32:05] bhert321: @KnetikTV this  isnt vanilla this is sod
[4:32:09] Deftvx: whats the addon ppl using to swap chest pieces for a diff rune? or w.e item
[4:32:13] bhert321: @KnetikTV this isnt vanilla this is sod
[4:32:18] Woldegg: 1 shotting rogues as a warrior is fun tho
[4:32:30] Rafiki818: rise against! nicee its been awhile
[4:32:31] olcrazyJs: @Deftvx not an addon, literally just macro
[4:33:04] valore97: soniiHorde
[4:33:29] kostax96: warrior needs utility runes, and lower damage
[4:33:41] sugawolf92: it sucks tbh
[4:33:41] Realtrickybeast: mages continue to suck
[4:33:42] boostedeg93: yeah
[4:33:45] h1bears: starsugre is trash
[4:33:46] xdyabolical: the nerf feels really bad
[4:33:48] KairuruTV: its not, they spread the dmg out so they actually have to CAST now
[4:33:51] killawatts75: no it isnt
[4:33:53] LaughTrak: it feels really bad. we're very very squishy so now I -have- to cast to do damage
[4:33:54] KairuruTV: cant just spam starsurge
[4:33:56] inspect4: mangle is hitting for 700 in bear form btw lol
[4:33:56] boostedeg93: i hit like a wet noodle
[4:33:58] KairuruTV: so they have to play the game now
[4:33:58] kostax96: yes it is very bad ,  starsurge hits for like 250 dmg non crit
[4:34:00] killawatts75: it just isnt insta spam dmg now
[4:34:01] Slowwolf17: Still an instant cast that hits for 500 lol
[4:34:01] sh00pz: they are trying to force boomies to use starfire, which obv is just dumb for pvp
[4:34:03] don_kneee: they still good tho lol
[4:34:13] outofmanax: I mean boomies still winning every 1v1 etc. You cant press 1 global and oneshot. Big deal
[4:34:14] galant3n: they buffed next starfire after starsurge to  80% instead of 66%
[4:34:14] kostax96: @Slowwolf17 it hits 250 not 500
[4:34:15] xdyabolical: @KnetikTV no they didnt. starfire is a 9% crit that hits slightly more than wrath
[4:34:16] KairuruTV: they went from GOD tier down to A+ tier
[4:34:18] sugawolf92: went from 1500 to 200 starsurge
[4:34:18] XPunchlineX: imagine having a caster to actually cast KEKW
[4:34:24] veiloflonelystars: most boomies are just FOTM players who were used to have their 6sec starsurge spam kill players
[4:34:25] Lopnk: they are still good.. if you only pressed 1 button before you just sucked on a broken class lol
[4:34:29] Chaboi_Twill: i think the 30% was fair, cuz it was broken but the SP modifier hurt
[4:34:31] BIEM491: They can still just kite and almost insta kill you
[4:34:38] kngkoji: how do you fix warriors though
[4:34:41] kngkoji: second wind?
[4:34:42] BlownFuse_: I honestly think it’s hilarious the takes boomies have
[4:34:44] KairuruTV: A LOT of the boomies were vanilla parsing warriors
[4:34:49] BlownFuse_: literally can’t one skill people so the class is bad
[4:34:54] outofmanax: rather have shockwave than stormbolt
[4:34:58] ShadoHC: you had me priest vs rogue P1... but warrior vs rogue P2 yummy for me
[4:34:59] schloops420: is this tipper?
[4:35:02] AndroidDream: what song is this? so familiar
[4:35:05] kostax96: @Chaboi_Twill its not fair , it needed actually a buff not a nerf Kappa
[4:35:10] FUSenh: why the fuck would they give warrior lay on hands
[4:35:11] hullkki: second wind
[4:35:12] grkgemini94: they would make invincible dungeon/farm bots
[4:35:15] hoagie117: give us a way to get a fuck ton of rage plz
[4:35:16] Woldegg: also melee hunters need harpoon\
[4:35:19] BroccoliTom: did you just say u want AMS?
[4:35:23] julienb95: I'd say storm bolt second wind heroic leap
[4:35:23] punkotv: What do you think about Hunters (not Meele)
[4:35:28] miko_sod: Posture Check
[4:35:29] Coolsix: @AndroidDream Linkin park - Cure for the Itch
[4:35:29] julienb95: Is all they need
[4:35:31] BroccoliTom: OKAY ARTHAS
[4:35:38] killawatts75: now you need to find abilities to give to other classes to counter act that
[4:35:38] AndroidDream: @AndroidDream ty bro
[4:35:45] kostax96: warrior needs spell reflect
[4:35:53] BroccoliTom: HUH
[4:36:03] creaturesfan72: yeah not being stuck in any one posture is the ideal posture
[4:36:04] BlownFuse_: you’re a warrior. you know how to swing weapons. how you expect to cast an AMS
[4:36:05] benis____cannon: X
[4:36:07] Waysideh: "The best posture is the next one"
[4:36:14] suciopotterxd: pog jump
[4:36:16] BroccoliTom: we just gonna gloss over you talking about sitting "fully erect"?
[4:36:25] Realtrickybeast: my mage has been 1-shot by a warrior, they do not need stormbolt
[4:36:27] killawatts75: Not just storm bolt for everything else you said
[4:36:40] killawatts75: spear of bastion ams
[4:36:50] julienb95: I'd say storm.bolt second wind and heroic leap should be plenty
[4:37:02] BlownFuse_: I will quit the game if they put spear of bastion in sod. that shit was terrible
[4:37:06] ziiakk_: how have the bgs been going today
[4:37:07] kostax96: no storm bolt
[4:37:12] BlownFuse_: I hate vacuum mechanics like that
[4:37:18] kostax96: spell reflect would be enough, and leap
[4:37:19] Selecktt: If only mages had a free get out of stuns card every 20 seconds
[4:37:19] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: True
[4:37:26] outofmanax: heroicleap is too much. we have insane mobility already. Im flying around like a ping pong ball in bgs
[4:37:43] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: if warriors were better id play one
[4:38:09] kostax96: and what exactly do warriors have for mobility? a improved charge with rune?
[4:38:13] Bobs_Adventure: all classes are "fine" so far its only lvl 40 still. half your toolkit is still missing.. Lets not forget the new items and books blizzard are implementing each phase. balance + classic ESPECIALLY with SoD just is never going to be a thing
[4:38:18] KairuruTV: warriors are pretty weak right now for pvp; however, i think blizz is hesitant to toss TOO much at them due to them scaling so well later
[4:38:28] xsurgonx: so many banger songs man
[4:38:30] KairuruTV: because once they give something, taking it away is VERY hard
[4:38:36] outofmanax: You have charge in combat, breaks roots slows etc, same with intercept, same with eintervene. Heroic leap would be crazy lmao
[4:39:14] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: true
[4:39:16] Tyfonius: what does stormbolt do?
[4:39:22] BlownFuse_: ignore pain makes the class broken
[4:39:23] XPunchlineX: range stun
[4:39:23] phreakzyo: stun
[4:39:29] kostax96: i just want BIG dmg on boomkin they promised us dmg and now they nerf us , sod dream is dead
[4:39:32] julienb95: Storm bolt I totally agree with you man that's totally fine
[4:39:32] Woldegg: and you cant dodge that, its op
[4:39:35] retox248: Yeah that Would be so fine
[4:39:42] KairuruTV: i think warriors just need some sort of sustain
[4:39:43] Tyfonius: i mean, paladins have thatno?
[4:39:44] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: i think storm bolt
[4:39:47] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: would balance
[4:39:47] KairuruTV: stun not so much
[4:39:54] Selecktt: It demonstates their fear of the superior class that they will not allow warriors to have ANY utility
[4:39:57] Medflight22: what weapon are you using @SONII
[4:40:00] outofmanax: @kostax96 youre still doing hella dmg man. You can cast yknow
[4:40:01] yarrpeter: @kostax96 i think they'll tweak it a bit. Big dmg good but one shotting in pvp with little to no counter play is bad
[4:40:10] NotBravoTV: Warriors BIS character right now
[4:40:21] kostax96: @outofmanax its bad dmg , only option is to heal now with druid
[4:40:26] KairuruTV: id like to see warrior get something like a defy death mechanic where when at 0 health they stay alive for like 5-7 seconds and if they kill something they heal
[4:40:44] CRASHOVERIDEmusic: lol
[4:40:53] Squeekyman: what's this song?
[4:40:58] kostax96: @yarrpeter it was not 1 shot, 1k crit is nothing, shadow word crits more
[4:41:18] BlownFuse_: lol ^ the balance Druid speaks
[4:41:23] outofmanax: @kostax96 mate ive taken 2.1k starsurges in the head before nerf
[4:41:25] BlownFuse_: “starsurge was fine”
[4:41:25] LaughTrak: yeah and rets have more bubbles than warriors. whats your point brother
[4:41:26] julienb95: I like my ret paladin a ton
[4:41:27] yarrpeter: @kostax96 my bad 2 shotting
[4:41:33] shammyayla: we need titans grip :/
[4:41:37] julienb95: Thats my main hahhaa
[4:41:39] boomboompaaow: WARRIORS are dogshit
[4:41:46] kostax96: i was doing 1k crits with bis BFD gear, idk what 2k are u talking about
[4:41:46] NotBravoTV: Dosen't matter if they can close the gap if we can't do shit
[4:41:52] bhert321: i honestly agree enraged regen shoudl be 50% or 80 tbh
[4:41:54] p_fet: idk why blizz insists on everyone pumping dps but not adding stam to gear
[4:41:58] svartamamban: Warriors feel rly bad atm
[4:42:00] KairuruTV: what classes are worse in pvp atm than a solo warrior?
[4:42:10] outofmanax: @kostax96 I dunno maybe your gear is bad, your specc is bad i dunno. but people where doing 1.5 easy
[4:42:11] XPunchlineX: none
[4:42:13] Ashlikesnows: @killawatts75 KEKW good one
[4:42:15] Tyfonius: how are ferals in pvp?
[4:42:15] Ashlikesnows: Kappa
[4:42:19] BlownFuse_: starsurge was fine. good players didn’t die to starsurge. lol. isn’t that what dude said the other day
[4:42:21] kostax96: @BlownFuse_ im pathetic healer now , not a gigachad boomkin
[4:42:23] Jevanss: Havent played warrior, but man Cat feels so bad. Finally were good come P1 and now we are meh again
[4:42:23] bhert321: also intervene shouldnt cost rage
[4:42:24] treyywow: the skill cap on warriors is so high tho compared too other classes
[4:42:40] punkotv: Should a Class always be possible to counter every other class? what is your opinion on that?
[4:42:42] Ashlikesnows: People who don't play warrior don't get the struggle
[4:42:45] retox248: is warrior strong in duels or no?
[4:42:46] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[4:42:47] boomboompaaow: yes
[4:43:12] PervyySAGEEE: classic warriors have always felt bad till 60 with good gear

[4:43:27] Tyfonius: how do i beat rogue that stuns me for 10 years and kills me before i can act
[4:43:32] BroccoliTom: @KnetikTV same, true balance is near imposssible
[4:43:35] don_kneee: true
[4:43:35] ziiakk_: ye 15
[4:43:36] PervyySAGEEE: warriors are the most gear dependent class in the game
[4:43:36] TumadreMG: yep
[4:43:39] mikayatheephrog: nwb says yes
[4:44:19] phreakzyo: When we seeing some Priest gameplay
[4:44:35] BroccoliTom: vanilla has NEVER been balanced for 1v1s, and i dont think it shoudl be
[4:44:41] yarrpeter: and ziqo auto loses to snutz
[4:44:52] KairuruTV: right now im just having a hard time deciding what i want to MAIN, trying to envision level 60 with these classes
[4:45:02] Selecktt: I really thought pshero would take the mokgora. rogue in a 1v1 format tournament seemed incredible.
[4:45:18] haileyxzx: still deciding whether i should go ele shaman or priest
[4:45:21] Tyfonius: im really happy with ele shaman right now, but 1v1s are rough
[4:45:24] creaturesfan72: banger alert holy
[4:45:25] outofmanax: @Selecktt pshero when perp was in it? nah
[4:45:32] KairuruTV: im between rogue and ranged hunter
