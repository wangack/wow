[0:39:17] iheartmywife: bro KEKW
[0:39:20] AxB_lol: I'm picky about what I put into my body, cause I know it will become dependent on whatever I start.
[0:39:27] JPeaches: more dots more dots on the kids
[0:39:28] FreckFPS: i saw in org the other day "mydadcritmymom" lol
[0:39:29] dumpringz: rofl
[0:39:30] Brittykittie: that's so true.  Also all the chemicals in our food cause bad gut health which creates a lot of similar symptoms as ADHD
[0:39:31] benbreezi: HORDE WORSE THAN ALLY
[0:39:35] Bidsee: I bet you missed BFD lol
[0:39:42] Kroski: @AxB_lol that mindset is probably what gets you dependent in the first palce
[0:40:00] pointmadness: Dude I was watching a video from someone who lives in a small village in norway and he was sitting outside in the sun reading lord of the rings and It made me want to immediately be in norway

[0:40:23] OGSceneBoy: I never got it, and I have been fine
[0:40:25] brenndannn: constantly clearing my throat
[0:40:26] KanedaIO: no difference
[0:40:26] bronchoped1: Especially brain fog
[0:40:27] Aravov: it's about availability of shit food, it used to be harder to chose shit that kills us
[0:40:27] julitorat: !server
[0:40:28] Nightbot: SOD - Crusader Strike (RPPvP) Horde ; HC - Defias Pillager Alliance
[0:40:28] handpickedbytim: GIGACHAD i had all the vaccines
[0:40:29] Pietruth: didnt get either GIGACHAD
[0:40:35] MarkyOchoa: You have long-covid sounds like
[0:40:36] julzvn: yes and my health is everything to me
[0:40:37] knuuuunt: how is your sleep?
[0:40:40] yokoishealin: no difference for me
[0:40:41] Rakoshiii: Idk I got my life together after covid so its much better now
[0:40:42] FreckFPS: i didnt get the poke but i do remember sleeping something off that coula been covid
[0:40:44] KyHu9DeC: говори по нашему, ничего не понятно
[0:40:44] Paradiddle7: well yeah its a respiratory illness so when the resp system is hit, it fucks with a ton of stuff
[0:40:47] Connor_The_Pirate: i got it and the booster since I was working as a paramedic at the time, I have had really good health. no impact
[0:40:47] gurknel: Ive had covid 3x and but haven't really been sick otherwise in years really
[0:40:50] TobyNova: I've had less colds tbh but i've been more depressed/anxious.. not sure if it's because of covid, just general state of the world for me
[0:40:53] Kroski: I'm going on my 8th booster !
[0:41:01] Dono988: The vaccines hurt the immune system
[0:41:04] KyHu9DeC: govori po russki
[0:41:05] fictionless33: what ever that meant
[0:41:06] FreckFPS: yea
[0:41:12] gigathree: I feel great

[0:41:23] JPeaches: @Shane_Gamess that's hardmode
[0:41:26] jwlindl: :) :) :) got forced to get the you know what and since then I agree. Feel like I have to do a lot more to get to that baseline I had prior. Could be mental
[0:41:30] keyzhc: The music is fire? Link to playlist?
[0:41:34] KanedaIO: the whole brain fog/mind numb thing, at least as i can tell, is related to lifestyle not long covid. LC is just a stand in, in the same way particular mental health spectrums get defaulted to.
[0:41:45] Shane_Gamess: @JPeaches some would say the hardest mode
[0:41:51] KhanoTV: Is that a mark on your forehead or a shadow?
[0:42:00] DrMaggz: CoH is 100% the play on turtle boss
[0:42:08] TobyNova: Agreed though something with this whole covid thing still feels off
[0:42:11] NawtyTyme: sigh
[0:42:13] iheartmywife: I got vaxxed in '21 after looking into ER statistics but never got a re-boost after more data came out about folks my age (male healthy mid 20s). Never had a huge issue with covid but I had a lingering sinus infection last year that didnt go away for like 5 months. Was hell. Had to really be dilligent with sleep and nutrition to feel solid again.
[0:42:16] NawtyTyme: some people
[0:42:16] tou0four: not again
[0:42:19] clappuchino: it fucked up my head and nervouse system and i had veritgo .. almost 3 years to recover so far
[0:42:24] FreckFPS: Awkward
[0:42:26] keyzhc: He just got back ylal
[0:42:30] keyzhc: please no
[0:42:31] Brittykittie: @clappuchino wow thats crazy

[0:43:04] TobyNova: typical warrior forehead if you ask me

[0:59:57] CT_Wolfe: Do you down rank your spells when youre healing?
[1:00:15] bronchoped1: Can't believe resto shaman main not going shaman
[1:00:22] TheReam: whats the addon that shows the exact health of the boss?
[1:00:28] TobyNova: BUT
[1:00:54] petedelete2019: mage or rogue seems to be the way
[1:00:55] Winttyrr: is warrior good 1v1 in wrath?
[1:01:00] orphesis: i think we will still be top tier though
[1:01:05] beadle19s: rage regen / Rallying / Last Stand
[1:01:09] petedelete2019: well druid seems op
[1:01:10] KhanoTV: I want warrior to get bladestorm or heroic leap
[1:01:17] TobyNova: 100%
[1:01:22] gurknel: they're already OP af
[1:01:25] RyokinTV: because warriors were the best dps in classic
[1:01:26] KhanoTV: Ya it feels like they are holding back on warrior a bit
[1:01:28] TobyNova: Haven't Warriors had it pretty good though?
[1:01:29] Kyzin7: for real I think the same thing
[1:01:32] Snorlax_King: they should give warrior heroic leap
[1:01:33] GordanRamseyGaming: apparently war still simming top dps by far
[1:01:35] gurknel: they are top DPS what's the complaint lol
[1:01:37] bronchoped1: They have to as classic earrior is already broken in raids. As we seen in bfd
[1:01:40] Sqwibbie: Biased ofc KEKW
[1:01:43] KhanoTV: Fully agree
[1:01:49] Gyrospeter: sadly there will not be dual spec
[1:01:53] Noz831: definitely comes from a bias
[1:01:54] RyokinTV: look at lvl 25 warriors all topp 100 on dps charts in bfd
[1:01:55] qqmastha: they are best dmg even with these runes :D
[1:02:04] Winttyrr: even playing careful, warrior is top dps
[1:02:04] NawtyTyme: we will get titan grip at 60
[1:02:15] TobyNova: Yeh
[1:02:17] papa_squat123: TG KEKW

[1:02:21] Lazzius: BUT DPS = FUN NO!? OMG
[1:02:21] petedelete2019: they are soo borring lets be honest'
[1:02:29] wreck561: yea who cares about parsing lol pvp is where its at
[1:02:32] TobyNova: GIVE ME TACOS TO THROW

[1:04:37] Tambandia: charging in combat does sound insane though
[1:04:41] KhanoTV: Thats not the point, the new fun game play mechanics are missing from warrior vs every other class
[1:04:42] Rugmouse: Sonii about to take another streaming break KEKW
[1:04:42] xxthelivingtribunalxx: Chat whats the  new OTK tournament
[1:04:49] Nickzorz91: Warriors are objectively the worst PVP class right now, warbringer is not insane lol
[1:04:56] zerufs: Top parsers dont even use that lol
[1:04:59] NawtyTyme: ol
[1:05:00] NawtyTyme: lol
[1:05:06] DarkNoble: y is that a rune u get that with talent
[1:05:07] elementixxx: chargin in combat is same as charge skill without any rune
[1:05:10] Cyhero: Warrior PvP sucks
[1:05:11] Kersed805: lowkey you never die to warrior unless you are afk
[1:05:13] RyokinTV: can you explain so i understand
[1:05:15] benbreezi: Rogues got charge in combat XD
[1:05:15] NawtyTyme: penece and pom were OP
[1:05:16] itsriversend: This is how boomies feel when starsurge gets shit on
[1:05:17] Winttyrr: what else does a warrior need rn in your opnion? im not well versed in pvp
[1:05:20] Cyhero: in Phase 1 at least
[1:05:23] Tangents92: druids got phat starsurge but warrior got charge in combat KEKW
[1:05:26] orphesis: Warrior runes < NPC runes
[1:05:28] jschroe3: tale as old as time trolls triggering sonii over warrior lol
[1:05:30] zerufs: Heroic LEAP
[1:05:31] NawtyTyme: warrior ya
[1:05:32] zerufs: GIEF
[1:05:33] loopin0003: Warriors need dual wand spec I keep saying this
[1:05:35] RyokinTV: you pretty much pointed out my comments with out telling me what im saying is wrong
[1:05:37] gigathree: warrior feels different in pve i will say
[1:05:38] wuddupnickk: its just cringe theyre making classic wow a wrath spinoff
[1:05:59] rincon_: How do you really change warrior though? I feel like it's a pretty barebones class
[1:06:08] bronchoped1: The could make warrior fun but then would need to nerf damage by a shit ton
[1:06:10] ohkay710: welcome back homie
[1:06:10] Vertigo_GB: You think warrior not going to top parse in Gnommer? But I do agree, they didn't get anything nice
[1:06:12] petedelete2019: give them whirlwind? @SONII
[1:06:13] StrictLiability41: @SONII charging in combat is so new and innovative! (i hit my head and forgot Intercept exists)
[1:06:16] jschroe3: Theyre saving it for 60 phase
[1:06:19] NawtyTyme: i wonder when priest are gonna get the tugg
[1:06:21] zerufs: You dont like the warrior anymore ?
[1:06:28] Winttyrr: @wuddupnickk your enot forced to play sod. the era servers still exist
[1:06:29] tatzu_u: fix you position. your lower back will thank me <3
[1:06:42] bronchoped1: Everyone has world buff in sod though
[1:06:48] RyokinTV: i respect everything about you cause you are the best pvp warrior player
[1:06:52] KhanoTV: If it was more like MoP warrior i would be all for it. MoP warrior was so fun
[1:06:52] Lazzius: But this is SoD and it should be about more build possibilities and differences from Classic for sure
[1:06:55] tatzu_u: your*
[1:07:00] RyokinTV: its why i watch you
[1:07:00] tatzu_u: yes
[1:07:05] StandardOut: Thank you whoever mentioned posture.
[1:07:13] jschroe3: buffing others now so they can juice warrior later
[1:07:34] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[1:07:35] Dherjee: Warrior in PVE is a lot of fun. Open world and PVP i regret playing warrior. Its as simple as that
[1:07:54] gigathree: becuz they dont understand how good %dmg stats are on warrior in classic wow
[1:07:59] bronchoped1: Seems like rogue or druid may parse better now
[1:07:59] Lazzius: I think there's something int he "shouts" abilities, they could create new ones
[1:08:01] tatzu_u: @StandardOut I gotchu

[1:08:05] jschroe3: thats what i meant by juiced
[1:08:09] KhanoTV: Honestly they probably dont have a warrior player on the dev team so they dont know what to do with them
[1:08:14] ezentricks: warrior good in pvp phase 2 possibly?
[1:08:15] Zyphy266: need fun utility not numbers
[1:08:16] jschroe3: cool shit later
[1:08:24] zerufs: One stance to use everything
[1:08:27] gigathree: everyone is a warrior player
[1:08:29] Winttyrr: @SONII are you hoping for utility runes for warriors? im not sure what youre trying to imply by cool and fun
[1:08:30] bronchoped1: They all paladin mains Kappa
[1:08:30] mixx10211: you want Spell reflect, heroic leap and bladestorm am I right @SONII ?? :D
[1:08:40] darkh0rst: epic staff now, calling it
[1:08:53] jschroe3: here comes the staff
[1:08:58] benbreezi: I think they messed up going titans grip for fury when they shoulda made fury for faster weapons like a sword rogue but minus stuns add damage / defense
[1:09:02] ohg33: Isn't there a factor to mention for Whirwind and DPS being very high again in P2, even though there isn't a carnival aspect to runes/etc?
[1:09:04] Ypsirc17: gz on staff!
[1:09:10] KhanoTV: GOOD LUCK!
[1:09:13] tou0four: i hope it drops for you man
[1:09:15] KhanoTV: I have yet to see it drop on my mage rip
[1:09:18] elementixxx: thats why sod online is less then wotlk, a lot of classes just trash to play
[1:09:27] derty93: you think shadow will be better than boomie for pve?
[1:09:28] muzhrooms8: staff been dropping non stop since phase 1 is about to end
[1:09:29] darkh0rst: shadowsonii inc
[1:09:31] muzhrooms8: mark my words ez clap
[1:09:33] Ypsirc17: 3 rogues and a shaman and the chains going off is insane
[1:09:38] ohg33: Right
[1:09:43] neighbor220: i think its about range having a massive advantage in pvp, heoric leap or a grip would be cool for warrior
[1:09:43] norxnz: norxnz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:09:49] iheartmywife: @elementixxx cant speak for anyone else but personally I just raid log on 1 toon.

[1:09:58] KhanoTV: so many brain dead players lol
[1:10:01] Benit: since meeles tend to scale worse than casters with gear i guess caster gonna catch up now and maybe compete in p3 or p4
[1:10:01] jschroe3: tbh as non warrior player watching warrior looks fun to me xD
[1:10:03] shloom995: ow much gold you gateed for phase 2?
[1:10:03] iheartmywife: @elementixxx so outside of launch sweating i'm doing maybe 3 hours a week lol
[1:10:03] brammertime: warriors always scaled hardest in vanilla too. So im sure they will still be
[1:10:04] primisone: Are the warriors in your grp feeling the 10% damage decrease in consumed by rage?
[1:10:10] bronchoped1: Staff dropping often right now
[1:10:12] Lenzaloca: oh shit you're the only person rolling for staff if it drops lol
[1:10:14] Winttyrr: clickers staring at their action bars
[1:10:14] darkh0rst: ZUG ZUG
[1:10:14] Lenzaloca: Prayge
[1:10:18] shloom995: how much gold did you gather for p2? @SONII
[1:10:30] Z3ND0G: Dust to Dust
[1:10:31] tou0four: NOOOOO THE AD

[1:26:53] TuLK4sx: the question is, is it allowed to swap, things ouit of combat, for example you used dispersion you got out of combat and switch your boots where you have Pain Sup on it

[2:37:23] MrThreePik: Warriors are all 8+ inches tho so take it easy

[2:39:03] Zagecsss: Horde = best faction, best races , best players etc
[2:39:07] fezsmash: "both my dads play horde" that is funny
[2:39:17] bronchoped1: Alliance gets a totem weapon? No? Then useless

[2:41:14] bronchoped1: @sonii skills proccing wild strikes now. Mangle, crusader strike etc
[2:41:23] Astralthundr: being good for your mental will in turn be good for the business/brand
[2:41:24] MattySimp: balance
[2:41:28] shalomski: Btw @sonii rake does more dmg now and scales with AP
[2:41:29] eskivoart: compaining about life is one of my favorite hobbies lol
[2:41:31] vepsee: @SONII check the link
[2:41:34] augusttabrizi: It's like the moon's cycles. We need rest to rejuvenate..
[2:41:35] santidia: thats the discussion about a 4 day/week work life
[2:41:46] tou0four: shave your head and wave will get business back again
[2:41:52] GregWasTaken: unless ur the avatar
[2:42:12] bl0pp3r: @SONII if you had to choose between mage, rogue or feral for and alt, which one would you choose and why? im torn between the three
[2:42:15] shalomski: You can use rake now @sonii
[2:42:17] ShinerG: work consumes my life so much its fuckin terrible man
[2:42:22] dreamreamer: No one does shit on mondays and fridays lol
[2:42:24] vepsee: rake got buffed
[2:42:26] vepsee: to scale with AP
[2:42:26] limburgse: hey hey Sonii and chat! HeyGuys
[2:42:42] limburgse: P2 HYPE! PogChamp
[2:42:43] vepsee: mangle first
[2:42:45] shalomski: Yh all
[2:42:46] vepsee: then you can rake
[2:42:53] Ariyalol: Hello friend, hope you don't mind me asking:) how tall are you?
[2:42:54] vepsee: not this boss obviously
[2:43:16] Connor_The_Pirate: well it really depends on the type of work. Like working on your own business that is fulfilling goals is different than office job haha
[2:43:23] vepsee: shred also got buffed, 225% > 300%
[2:43:30] santidia: Yea but how boring is feral gonna be at 40 without power shifting tho zzzzzzzzzzz
[2:43:39] Ellie_theMarmot: it does
[2:43:49] azzy_dog: New tools to go with the big brain
[2:43:50] vepsee: @santidia what? you'll still powershift lol
[2:43:53] santidia: ofc better understanding of the other classes
[2:43:54] xeam_oce: the more you play other classes the more you understand their playstyle, how they play around their cooldowns and what to expect which makes sense
[2:44:06] santidia: @santidia but hwy tho? U cant get furor and no wolfshead so its shit
[2:44:09] xeam_oce: it like opens your third eye when you go back to warrior
[2:44:44] vepsee: @santidia you dont run omen , you go deep feral + 5/5 furor
[2:44:45] Ariyalol: How are boomies gonna be in 40?
[2:44:57] vepsee: @SONII https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=216522/blood-spattered-stiletto
[2:44:59] santidia: @santidia how do you go deep feral and still get furor
[2:45:05] youwiththefeds: Most warriors aren't very good at pvp positioning wise I think thats the biggest learning curve
[2:45:12] nitrodubs_: Phase 2 giving me wotlk vibes and feelsbad
[2:45:30] Ariyalol: Should I keep playing my warrior then? T_T
[2:45:56] santidia: then u dont get leader of the pack and only 1 on HoW
[2:45:58] gen7lem4n: little yo
[2:46:10] TuvaIaTimmy: enchanted mageweave bags can't come soon enough
[2:46:10] vepsee: @santidia lotp is a dps loss anyways
[2:46:11] youwiththefeds: Did u see druid hots will be able to stack in p2
[2:46:11] Nimbus723: @santidia pretty sure 0/26/5 gonna be the build next phase
[2:46:13] gen7lem4n: great sir, how about you?
[2:46:15] cruzjc1991: VoHiYo
[2:46:15] Ariyalol: Im hoping they're gonna be fun, especially with warbringer and all the ways to get out of movement effects, but hearing about all these casters being nutty makes me anxious
[2:46:17] nitrodubs_: just too many meaningless APM stuff it seems. and the itemization seems not versatile for hybrids
[2:46:19] zachh_93: you think p2 will last as long as p1 did
[2:46:27] nitrodubs_: and it's very linear progression. Like every item comes from 1 raid
[2:46:29] santidia: @santidia yea but which group is taking a feral who DOESN'T bring LOTP
[2:46:30] VinoHuncho: you think priests will be crazy next phase or just spriests?
[2:46:40] popitforchrist: dman done already?
[2:46:45] vepsee: @santidia its a group dps loss, if you really wanted lotp you'd bring a druid tank
[2:46:46] TheWouze: warriors need that spell reflect bruh
[2:46:47] beingg0d: @SONII you're fucking back, missed you homie
[2:46:50] santidia: it would only MAYBE make sense with 2 ferals in the same group
[2:46:50] veiloflonelystars: mage is gonna be crazy too
[2:46:57] azzy_dog: Oh snap
[2:46:58] santidia: @santidia yea exactly i think ur bringing a bear only
[2:47:01] santidia: and cats loses out
[2:47:08] windu_waka: @sonii Why HS to repair and not at the repair guy in BFD?
[2:47:11] Ellie_theMarmot: and you dont die after?
[2:47:13] TuvaIaTimmy: 30s of free healing sounds bonkers
[2:47:20] vepsee: cat is gonna do too much dps to not bring at least one, also bear without mangle if you run lacerate
[2:47:24] vepsee: you'll end up bringing 1 of each
[2:47:24] youwiththefeds: I'm assuming that spirit thing either kills caster after 30secs or it needs to be purgeable
[2:47:25] vepsee: minimum

[2:47:43] derty93: @Ariyalol i missed the answer to this cuz im muted, whatd he say?
[2:47:44] santidia: @vepsee idk man cats will have to do more dps than warrior and rogue, and i dont think it will
[2:47:50] Ellie_theMarmot: ohhh that pretty cool
[2:47:50] youwiththefeds: Thats gonna be VERY balanced
[2:47:55] santidia: maybe thats just me but i dont see it out of the changes
[2:47:56] vepsee: @santidia ur on crack if you dont think so lmfao
[2:48:09] santidia: i disagree so therefore i am on crack
[2:48:10] AlphaSimply: engraver addon has all the runes on it already for next phase
[2:48:11] santidia: allright sir
[2:48:12] vepsee: rogues even with the immunity change are still above average
[2:48:16] Ariyalol: @derty93 That pingponging was gonna be fun ^_^
[2:48:35] ShinerG: yes
[2:48:36] Skrimij_: I’m excited to try hybrid hunter, melee weaving I think it would be pretty fun/challenging
[2:48:38] AlphaSimply: yeah

[2:48:43] kiki_speaks: No

[2:52:07] timmyclemons: do you think feral is the way to go for leveling P2 @sonii ?

[3:05:14] turbytoo: do you take psyllium husk for gut health?
[3:05:22] Zerbs: my big thing is not understanding gut health tbh
[3:05:22] Z3ND0G: Bulkin and Cutting is risky cause you can lose momentum. There was one year I forgot to Cut #foreverbulk

[3:06:25] xeam_oce: @Z3Nonon yeah ive always found it hard to commit to proper bulks and cuts because i tend to go to extremes and its hard to commit long term, definitely find it easier to cut than bulk though
[3:06:29] Tdoh__: do you have a weak aura for those retail looking procs or an addon?
[3:06:30] Zagecsss: JESUS
[3:06:32] Zagecsss: how many reps????

[3:06:49] ezentricks: yeah no shot you can recover from 15 sets to failure in one session lol
[3:06:51] NutterCircus: Yea, those are cut reps for sure.

[3:07:45] Tdoh__: @jschroe3 ty!
[3:07:54] Z3ND0G: There was a study came out last year that 4 set per body part minimum. So 2 sets of 2 exercises per part is good goal for beginners
[3:07:55] ezentricks: but like 15-20 sets for one muscle? or do you do like upper/lower or fullbody type splits?

[3:43:15] grylz89: I think
[3:43:17] keredj: that would be amazing lol
[3:43:26] fourkgaming: freedom lasts for 10sec, 16 sec with talent
[3:43:27] keredj: grounding a kidney
[3:43:29] not_vern: Also does it clear roots like freedom or does it need to be active before like FAP
[3:43:31] ziiakk_: cant wait for the next tournament so hype
[3:43:32] Cryptikwow: yupp
[3:43:38] Astralthundr: lol that has been on going discussion in the shaman discord
[3:43:48] inyoface009: does it reflec more than 1 attack ?
[3:43:48] Cryptikwow: it should clear yea
[3:43:57] brandvarmbums: surely it just gives u the freedom buff when u drop it regardless if it gets killed insta
[3:43:59] spike82q: SO marks dont yield exp upon turn in in ph 2 ?
[3:44:13] miciahclay: nope :/
[3:44:15] grylz89: Guess it has pve uses aswell for tanks / mitigation
[3:44:15] vepsee: waaah
[3:44:20] Astralthundr: the speculation is that the totem will apply a buff that is not tied to the totem itself

[3:47:58] Noggs_: 100%
[3:48:04] jschroe3: yeah
[3:48:06] nikola420tesla: That would add an extra tank to both sides EZ solution
[3:48:06] vepsee: I'd be ok if they did it at lvl 60, so people cant just free reroll like right now
[3:48:06] otirisj: they still might
[3:48:06] Rapapep: fuck it dont see why not
[3:48:07] pointmadness: Dude I want to be a alliance Shaman so bad
[3:48:08] jimg3: no way
[3:48:09] not_vern: With the new races though?
[3:48:10] brandvarmbums: but where does it stop if u do that???
[3:48:10] Rapapep: classic is the world anyway
[3:48:16] jschroe3: they only favor ally though
[3:48:18] talikars: nah that's ass. All the shaman and paladin quests are faction specific  in classic
[3:48:20] brandvarmbums: next is barbershop + transmog?
[3:48:21] wreckshoptv: horde doesnt have bubble
[3:48:22] mitchp333: no
[3:48:22] Wolfinosg: @SONII but this way they do it adds more uniqueness to it and something new
[3:48:30] vepsee: have it like some lvl 60 questline
[3:48:31] veiloflonelystars: only if dwarf shaman and tauren paly?
[3:48:33] mitchp333: just doesn’t make sense lore atp
[3:48:39] ca_Y_z: some hope to trigger anything verbally. its nonsense
[3:48:41] nikola420tesla: No need for rogue and warlock tanks if they gave Shaman to alli and Pally to horde YEP
[3:48:52] veiloflonelystars: i think its cool hunters got kings buffs etc
[3:48:52] ca_Y_z: precisely because its germany
[3:48:57] miloxz: whats wrong with barbershop? I feel like it'd be great to have so long as its limited to just hair/beared/color and not actually editing ur character
[3:48:59] deniedh: nah the amount of npcs, lore quests zones all of that that they had to change for that to hapen
[3:49:00] jschroe3: having a take a rune to make up for something the other fation just has
[3:49:01] Wolfinosg: @SONII and also find your way around the new kit for rotations and ways to make it actual work
[3:49:02] Rapapep: You got a point there
[3:49:03] jschroe3: is dumb
[3:49:03] cyabrotv: @nikola420tesla theyre still used on horde side what u mean
[3:49:03] kaymacc: kaymacc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:49:03] nikola420tesla: I had this thought too originally
[3:49:06] Bidsee: but adding a horde or allly version has already been done
[3:49:10] Zagecsss: LUL
[3:49:11] brandvarmbums: imo they should never have started giving shamans pala ability and the otherw ay
[3:49:18] ca_Y_z: isnt it written
[3:49:19] eskivoart: that guy yappin
[3:49:21] KKonaStevieG: wrong chatterino tab Kappa
[3:49:26] nikola420tesla: @stoprelax i think you misread
[3:49:43] Tambandia: They shouldve just made them available. Id say they shoudl release new class/race combos too
[3:49:43] Hayzed0ut: someone has to be smart in the conversation
[3:49:44] limburgse: HUH
[3:49:44] Zagecsss: 0 IDEA
[3:49:46] Upcomin: lil bro is high af
[3:49:48] ca_Y_z: didnt he say i 'said' it
[3:49:49] ca_Y_z: :O
[3:49:52] eskivoart: bro talkiing morse code in alphabet
[3:49:52] vepsee: if they did a questline or some shit at lvl 60 so you couldnt just free reroll in a bracket like rn, so you'd have to actually invest time into the char
[3:49:54] TuvaIaTimmy: google translate thought it knew
[3:49:57] limburgse: he's on some good shit
[3:50:08] Tdoh__: i feel like since they started giving other classes other classes abilites (Windfury, kings, salv, etc) may as well just of added horde pal and ally sham
[3:50:14] ryufromstreets6: the twitter bots are invading twitch chat with incoherent nonsense
[3:50:14] ca_Y_z: aye
[3:50:34] limburgse: hahah

[3:51:09] veiloflonelystars: i think its fine giving the key buffs but thats where it stops

[4:00:00] Wolfinosg: @SONII tbf they are already trying stuff and seems like its working out. maybe just give them a bit time ? i sound too good for saying this for blizzard due to their history but maybe there is hope ? KEKW
[4:00:00] miloxz: warriors were just boosted to have similar stats to other classes which got runes
[4:00:04] DadRage: wait so the leveling boost is out rn!?
[4:00:05] DadRage: Pog
[4:00:10] bangbangdeveloper: Warriors have level 60 rotation and upkeep of rage at level 25. How the FUCK is that not mindblowing?
[4:00:13] Nosdunk24: if you dont have fun playing warrior then play a different class, you don't HAVE to play warrior if you dont like it

[4:00:46] miloxz: runes were introduced to let other classes feel like a warrior for once
[4:00:46] Noggs_: and its gonna hit for 27 with these l.ow ass weapons
[4:00:48] DadRage: I forgot tbh
[4:00:49] DadRage: LUL
[4:00:51] Ddocz: @SONII what do u want? a seismic toss where u grab an enemy player and heroic leap with him?

[4:01:03] eskivoart: imagine they did this to ur hunter or mage bruh
[4:01:03] DadRage: I don't get ads, I have an adblock LUL
[4:01:10] Zagecsss: MMO Dad
[4:01:14] bangbangdeveloper: I don't know dude. It kind of sounds like they could add some runes in that adds a mechanically challening stance dance rotation and you'd still say "yeeeee but d00d stance dancing is just typical baseline warrior anyways"
[4:01:32] Zagecsss: Theyd be losing their shit
[4:01:33] Youngpoop: warriors are alright but mages can mass solo sfk KEKW

[4:01:48] Wolfinosg: to be fair all classes are being twicked except warr
[4:01:48] eskivoart: its like christmas and everyone getting new toys this year and we got the same thing from last year :(
[4:01:49] miestyman: imo mages are lame af
[4:01:58] miloxz: mages just getting more water per cast
[4:02:00] priestma: maybe he meant warriors are fine. like we dont have to worry cool Runes Will come
[4:02:04] scivationx: Thats fun tho

[4:32:18] Chopka: @SONII The abilities of the character Sett from League of legends would not be a bad idea for a warrior

[4:32:58] deltrexx: just nuke the world man
[4:33:01] jewelerdiaz: yuhhh
[4:33:02] Chef_Joshua: how many charges on that ability
[4:33:06] dft_kekwplays: yes thats nice but it needs to be bugged by 300% and then nurfed by 100% still tho ..

[4:33:19] Lannakzach: A rune to make whirlwind pull nearby enemies (10-yards) to you would be really cool.
[4:33:21] karrots96: Screw charging towards enemies, instead Warriors should get a hook chain that pulls enemies to the warrior and applies a bleed

[4:33:52] yung_gab_: @sonii what about a rogue ability that is a shotgun shot that deals massive dmg to 1 target but does aoe dmg that soak it into more targets, so it can be use in pvp for burst and pve for aoe
[4:33:53] brownfiesta: sounds all cool and all but what abilities do you actually want to see for warrior?
[4:34:02] Rugmouse: I would want an ability that absorbs DMG dealt to warrior and then counters back
[4:34:02] vepsee: a what?
[4:34:03] vepsee: count me in
[4:34:13] TobyNova: Grappling Hook
[4:34:15] santidia: i mean that is literally spear of bastion like come on
[4:34:29] brownfiesta: too many gap closers
[4:34:30] creedknows: how about like your charge leaves a wide fire trail that slows and dmgs enemys
[4:34:31] A5H0J: If it was skill shot

[4:36:39] Blide: @SONII how painful you think itll be running around stv solo pvping as Warrior? Even worth playing w/o a team?
[4:36:40] anmitsumami: love is in the air
[4:36:41] TheBarehand: What about a chain that tethers you to another player and increases your movement speed by 30% while ur tethered.

[4:58:08] Sarthe: type the name into the search bar to see the new leather one
[4:58:13] Kalanarr: The plate one sims higher now that the leather helm has 0 str on it

[4:59:34] Slyz777: 2h shams gonna pop off
[4:59:42] Sarthe: wrong
[4:59:46] santidia: but if bosses are +2
[4:59:46] Sarthe: +3 is all you need
[4:59:46] belliam99: +3 does nothing if youre an orc warrior with the new axe
[4:59:50] santidia: why would u need weapon skill
[4:59:51] Sarthe: confirmed
[4:59:54] Rapapep: It is +3 since bosses are +2 levels
[4:59:54] vluggejaapie89: +5 equals a level

[5:00:09] OGFonzi: is their a world where its beneficial to run both epics
