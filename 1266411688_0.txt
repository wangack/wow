[1:09:47] fat_european0: I hope it's something completely different and we just go to the Ethereal home world
[1:09:47] Storm_Taker: aCan't wait to get out of SL
[1:09:48] dalvynthedrunk: emerald dream is just azeroth untouched by mortals right? Seems like an ezclap way to reboot the game world
[1:10:10] Rudric_Ice: I still don't get what emerald dream is KEKW
[1:10:15] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Can we expect 10.0 this year? or Q1 next year?
[1:10:25] sinlesssinner: garrosh did nothing wrong! :)
[1:10:27] dalvynthedrunk: This year seems suuuuper unlikely at this point
[1:10:36] swordart_19: @Milanesa_De_Pollo next year i believe
[1:10:43] Nehcrom: Just wait.
[1:10:46] bypized: @Towelliee bet how many delays 10.0 will have?
[1:10:51] Nehcrom: Wait wait wait.

[1:11:16] fat_european0: 1 more year of Shadowlands FeelsBadMan
[1:11:17] neighborlybagel: when do you think they'll announce it?
[1:11:23] sinlesssinner: wait what 2023??!!
[1:11:24] ixiya_ink: So you think we will be in this last patch for almost a year?
[1:11:27] Persephonae: that was my guess! end of feb beginning of march 2023
[1:11:27] pavepawns: alotta games to play till 10.0
[1:11:36] swordart_19: @fat_european0 play something else fattie
[1:11:45] sinlesssinner: noway in hell its out on 2023, they cant do that or they lose more ppl
[1:11:50] Apokolipz: the pandemic  pushes all games back a year to two
[1:11:53] fat_european0: I am, but I want to play wow instead. Skinny
[1:12:01] Apokolipz: He Knows!!!
[1:12:24] Jarwerewolf: end  of  som
[1:12:30] swordart_19: Youtube rewind mvpv
[1:12:30] WhoIsAndrewJ: realistic to think that they won't announce the next xpack until 9.2 RWF is over?
[1:12:30] bypized: @Towelliee are they going for Lost Ark to come out first to then announce?
[1:12:30] pavepawns: i do hope a new class
[1:12:36] sinlesssinner: yea but thats still a year bro
[1:12:46] sinlesssinner: a year or no content
[1:12:47] Poriand: I’m ready Diablo immortal! Lol
[1:12:56] fat_european0: @pavepawns Same. I also hope for a new class
[1:12:59] neighborlybagel: a lot of people are cynical in the community, but do you think they're gonna pull off a solid 10.0?
[1:13:12] swordart_19: @nightbeygel you should make your mind not what others say
[1:13:14] Bradt04: As a long time wow player would I enjoy playing new world? right now I just play classic tbc and raid log
[1:13:23] Persephonae: honestly at this point if they try to push out shit content while people are already not happy with them itll be a deathblow
[1:13:26] fat_european0: I don't mind waiting a long time for 10.0 but I just hope it isn't a repeat of legion where the xpac is great but they don't learn the right lessons from it
[1:13:33] TheGiant99: Dak should of given the ball to the ref as the ref needs to spot the ball nbot the center
[1:13:37] swordart_19: @Bradt04 different games if you got money free to spend try i t
[1:13:38] neighborlybagel: @swordart_19 Asking for other people's opinions doesn't mean I don't have my own lol
[1:13:43] DrSoosh: keep shield buff stacked and charge em
[1:13:48] swordart_19: @nightbeygel pretty much does lol
[1:13:48] Persephonae: its a much safer idea to wait
[1:14:06] Poriand: Blizzard needs to start doing twitch drops for stuff
[1:14:06] neighborlybagel: Not even remotely @swordart_19
[1:14:18] nihilistic_bat: Or he didn't have to run down the middle of the field

[1:14:23] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[1:14:31] TheGiant99: AS the capt of the team he should have known to give it to the ref
[1:14:34] neighborlybagel: How would asking someone else's opinion to hear their opinion mean you don't have one of your own?
[1:14:35] TheGuchie: its not the refs fault that the cowboys needed 1 extra second to even have a chance, one ref being not as fast as an athlete is not an excuse
[1:14:51] crotastar: All I can say is, Go Bucs! Fire those cannons baby!
[1:14:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Alphas/betas are usually like 6-8 months?
[1:14:57] harris243124: Cowboys blew it regardless
[1:15:06] swordart_19: I am delays enjoyer
[1:15:18] sinlesssinner: @nightbeygel dont argue the inarguable :) let it go lol
[1:15:20] bypized: @Towelliee will Blizzard let Lost Ark have a launch without interferance?
[1:15:21] harris243124: Titans Vs Buccaneers super bowl
[1:15:28] neighborlybagel: @sinlesssinner true lmao
[1:15:32] jeffnsteff2019: TB aint going
[1:15:33] nihilistic_bat: @harris243124 Copium
[1:15:49] QMGSaint: You think 10.0 is launching this yr?
[1:15:49] TheGiant99: With the cowboys and their toxic fan base out the playoffs they will be alot better
[1:15:50] jeffnsteff2019: its GB vs KC
[1:15:51] TheGuchie: Bucs vs Bills
[1:15:52] Poriand: What if patch isn’t till like April
[1:16:00] dalvynthedrunk: Blizzard is likely prepared for a small 2022 for WoW, with only 9.2 and the conclusion of TBC. 2023 will have 10.0, and Classic Wrath
[1:16:12] Rudric_Ice: @qmgsaint  he said next January
[1:16:14] Stealinheals: i thought you and everyone was done with wow and activision cuz you know "outrage" and all that fake nonsense everyone had a few months ago
[1:16:17] TheGuchie: Would be a great story, Bills looking down the man who caused them so much grief for 2 decades
[1:16:18] Pallyex53: !RWF
[1:16:19] Moobot: @Pallyex53 Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[1:16:29] sinlesssinner: i am guessing blizzard realized they cant do much anymore by releasing stuff on the same week as other games... which is sad in and of itself
[1:16:41] sinlesssinner: blizzard isnt a heavy hitter anymore
[1:16:51] itsapaul: @Stealinheals Blizzards lost most of their business to business deals, who cares if someones playing a game lol
[1:16:52] dalvynthedrunk: Well I mean announcements and betas I think qualify as small compared to classic release and expansion release
[1:16:53] TheGiant99: But wrath isnt anything new
[1:16:55] harris243124: @theguchie  that ended well in the normal season Tom Brady beat ‘em lol towKawaii
[1:17:01] Skars111: horde and alliance joining forces
[1:17:05] bypized: How long until an engine overhaul?
[1:17:06] tonypie757: i still like wow because they have the best class design and PvE in any video game i have ever played. Rogues feel like rogues etc etc.
[1:17:12] Rudric_Ice: we need Wrath classic +
[1:17:14] TheGiant99: yes i do
[1:17:22] officialviz: Yeah but its wrath kelw
[1:17:23] officialviz: kekw
[1:17:38] tomfoolery_1: Is that tier list on Youtube?
[1:17:38] swordart_19: You think you do but you dont i feel same tbc andys felt :P will repeat
[1:17:39] TheGiant99: your right
[1:17:39] TheGuchie: I want to play Wrath cause I didnt get into it until ICC, and I never got to do hardmode which Id love to try
[1:17:40] TheUnknowing: same as tbcc or classic itself, none of it is new but its still hyped
[1:17:47] Apokolipz: pulls out frostmourne   * Frostmourne Hungers*
[1:17:48] Persephonae: if they wanted to stretch longer to 10.0 a patch after 9.2 focusing on past expansion QOL would be a great idea. not even needing to be big stuff.

[1:18:08] maccaruso: Wrath is going to kill incredibly quick unfortunately.  Nothing coming after.
[1:18:08] stayliftedna: I could see WotLK classic being the most popular of the classic launches so far
[1:18:10] bypized: @Towelliee do you think we will ever see an engine overhaul?
[1:18:14] fat_european0: When did you make the tier list? I'd be interested in watching your vods to find it :D
[1:18:20] itsapaul: @nilone4 They would've won if they didnt get themselves like 12 penalties LUL
[1:18:23] HoppsiDejsi: That lastest Insta post had me cackling
[1:18:24] tomfoolery_1: Yeah Ill go to the VoD as well to watch it
[1:18:25] dalvynthedrunk: Bc for sure, classic I dont think so
[1:18:26] Apokolipz: death knights !!!
[1:18:34] Stealinheals: @Itsapaul  that has nothing to do with everyone being full of shit

[1:18:47] Rudric_Ice: I nvr played wrath  and I wanna play wrath
[1:18:54] UberManDude: Facts!!!
[1:18:54] neighborlybagel: Tons of people played WoW only in wotlk and haven't touched it since who will come back to relive their memories
[1:18:59] Jigy_LB: Hard to not love wotlk
[1:19:02] itsapaul: @Stealinheals I mean, everyones playing ff14. You just happened to pick a wow stream to bitch in for some reason :P You aint slick
[1:19:07] QuigsTV: To me wrath was way better than vanilla @Towelliee
[1:19:09] Jarwerewolf: best time for be hunter
[1:19:28] 無職提督: oh, defly, i care less about BC or classic, but Wrath, let go baby!
[1:19:40] Stealinheals: @Itsapaul  i don't even know wtf you are yapping about
[1:19:47] Watershots: Yep I played Vanilla, Loved it, quit after the first raid tier in BC, Came back for Wrath and didnt leave till I was standing In my Garrison
[1:19:57] fat_european0: Hot take, ICC is the most overrated raid ever
[1:19:58] itsapaul: Beating algalon before the ToC break would be awesome
[1:20:01] stayliftedna: I would like to see FRESH wrath servers or an SoM style at the start
[1:20:01] partyanimalstone: yea wrath is going be fun
[1:20:07] Zettabyte: @Towelliee ICC dance-offs retuuuurns! Kappa
[1:20:09] dalvynthedrunk: @Stealinheals He never said he was done with WoW forever lmao, no one said they were done forever

[1:22:02] silentmrfox: Hippogryph
[1:22:06] dalvynthedrunk: @preheats_lawyer Classic really doesnt take anything from retail
[1:22:10] Broomba: @preheats_lawyer blizzard has 2 teams -- 1 working on retail 1 working on classic
[1:22:11] Knocx: that one i have
[1:22:13] Digidan2005: @Digidan2005 maybe that or like scourge pass; something along those lines

[1:29:42] Digidan2005: easy prep for next pre-patch/expac
[1:29:54] fat_european0: Yeah, you see loads of people getting chars ready. It was the same in Classic. Levelling before TBC came out was so much fun and the open world was filled with players
[1:30:29] Storm_Taker: You going to farm the X-45 Heartbreaker?
[1:30:30] YungDizzY: Last patch for MoP was fun as shit
[1:30:36] Watershots: Yep I pay for 1 month of wow right at the end when all the LFR's are out, smash themm all at once, Then watch streamers play , rinse , repeat
[1:30:37] Ugruel: looking good towelliee!
[1:30:42] Digidan2005: legion pre=patch was super great for alt leveling with the invasions
[1:31:03] KiwiGuy17: How long until the new raid is out
[1:31:05] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee when is mythic anduin testing?
[1:31:06] fat_european0: @YungDizzY Yeah for sure. The content drought didn't even feel bad imo. I raided almost all the time and never got burnt out. MoP was special
[1:31:09] KiwiGuy17: Haven’t played wow for a while

[1:33:46] fat_european0: I hope Blizz doesn't get discouraged from not PTR testing more bosses in the future if it doesn't go well this time around
[1:33:51] KiwiGuy17: Is that to help with the reset differences between US and EU?
[1:33:56] Lexi__Marie: will be interested to see where guilds stop week one to farm more gear

[1:39:49] preheats_lawyer: @ijuki You can get tier from the m+ or pvp section that rolls into tier. So let's say if head, gloves & chest only drops from the final 3 bosses. You could get tier gloves from your m+ section of the vault instead. They haven't fully explained how that'll work beyond just confirming that m+ and pvp drops tier in the vault from the start of the patch

[2:20:55] tomcruise210: dark zone in division was so fuckin good

[2:22:46] dalvynthedrunk: but the real truth is, Lost ark, End of Dragons, 10.0 xpac, none can fill the hole Wildstar left for me :(
[2:22:53] Alcade_IJ: Hey Towelliee quick question I am a type of person that has trouble sticking to one character in WoW because somehow I find something I don't like about it but I want to stick to one any advice on this?

[3:21:52] xmedpakx: oh no a questline in an MMO
[3:21:56] geokouts: i liked doing the quests in legion for my class hall and professions
[3:22:01] swordart_19: Legion i think
[3:22:01] TheUnknowing: legion
[3:22:01] pronkk_: iin legion
[3:22:03] Hakazo: Blizz can be incompitent, but man wow community is a bunch of dumbfucks, constant compalining like...
[3:22:04] swordart_19: there was llike nothing in BFA
[3:22:06] QuigsTV: @Towelliee Do you want a garrison invasion?
[3:22:07] balanira: legion
[3:22:11] Lexi__Marie: people did legion archeology for the necklace lol
[3:22:15] KingsandClubs: Archeology is missed potential at well
[3:22:16] Henke1983: holyfuck legion was bad
[3:22:17] PvtHudson093: In BFA the perk between professions was so uneven
[3:22:32] Hakazo: @Henke1983 ??!?!?!
[3:22:42] THUNDERTIGERDK: 8 year old is legion
[3:23:03] gravytrain_ubg: what does blizzard do for new players to the mmo so it dont die?
[3:23:12] Dagomarus: Shame zerith mortis and korthia would be prime archelology locations imo

[3:23:39] skeletonetiquette: The Legion world responses to your weapons was incredible, climbing a mountain with storm elementals and they all turned friendly because of the claw of Ra'Den for Elemental Shaman, epic shit. Completely irrelevant, but it was the coolest shit I'd seen in a while.
[3:23:42] PvtHudson093: As a Blacksmith i could repair one piece of gear on a timer and sometimes my crafted gear could proc indestructable
[3:23:55] xProcreator: the players want to be told what to say and do and then parrot it as a talking point for 6 months.
[3:23:58] pavepawns: i want a mount
[3:23:59] Hakazo: @Towelliee Its blizzards time to shine, as they say, its the end of a saga, now we will get a beginning of a saga, which actually hypes me up
[3:24:43] Xsilentghost: I dont understand why they dont have content creators at the council, you, max, max, even collectors like touchpad or asmon etc. Instead they have random people that dont even play wow for 10 hours a week
[3:25:00] Mozzeyy_: @hakazo yes the 10 year saga KEKW
[3:25:07] swordart_19: @Xsilentghost because they are self motivated
[3:25:09] caffeas988: It would help a lot of Blizzard devs would actually play the game ;)
[3:25:13] Dagomarus: I still have flashbacks to when choosing between transmutation master and potion master for alchemy was some outlands mote quest, i became a transmutation master and the next expansion they did away with the quest lol
[3:25:17] GodKingMuninn: Blizz devs just need to play the game for themselves and then they'll realize just how shit it is. And I don't feel like they do that enough, I don't think they've ever done a random bg, or geared an alt
[3:25:24] Bogzeh: ppl dont know what they want, blizz should have their own vision on the game
[3:25:27] Hakazo: @Mozzeyy_ yeah hihi, lets hope next saga is lit
[3:25:44] archiikz: Doesnt it hurt your eyes playing in such a dark room, @Towelliee  ?
[3:25:48] Hakazo: @Towelliee You're one of the only ones I know that have a connection with blizzard, whats up with Ion? actually worried my man went radio silent
[3:25:49] geokouts: i still have the potion master on my balance druid after all these years
[3:26:44] gravytrain_ubg: im only mad when they want to release a new transmog pay mount vs fixing issues like boregast.
[3:26:58] skeletonetiquette: no one likes it but you gotta stick to your guns on most things, because the people that are pissed off about ______ saying they quit the game, you gotta let that go, changing it only pisses off the other group, and then you still don't recapture first group cause it's too little too late
[3:27:07] Korupcija_: you're super early today dafuq
[3:27:09] Orgabism: Wait, you bumped heads with Asmon and he didn't break? :D

[3:27:43] gravytrain_ubg: wrath of lich king was best expansion
[3:27:47] skeletonetiquette: agreed, fel is a bit overdone for me
[3:27:50] gravytrain_ubg: frostmourne ftw
[3:28:03] lycas123: It would be really good if they would make professions viable in end-game again. Feels they are pretty useless now
[3:28:08] Hakazo: @Towelliee You're one of the only ones I know that have a connection with blizzard, whats up with Ion? actually worried my man went radio silent
[3:28:51] geokouts: He prob working on the next expantion
[3:28:52] Hakazo: I respect that honestly
[3:29:18] TClear: @geokouts more like the next explanation

[3:29:42] Sicknessqt: Rooting for Ion to deliver good 10.0
[3:29:43] Mozzeyy_: @towelliee do u think WoW will ever come to consoles?
[3:29:43] Xsilentghost: I wish Ion and Josh did those like hour Q & A's that they did in Legion and BFA. That was a nice thing to have once or twice every patch
[3:29:49] Hakazo: @Sicknessqt same
[3:30:02] Hakazo: @Xsilentghost ohhh almost forgot about those, loved those
[3:30:03] geokouts: inside a temple
[3:30:10] NiceGuyChrizmizz: The entrance is where you killed the boss
[3:30:22] gravytrain_ubg: 15% beer > wow
[3:30:51] LoseAlotLuke: will an expansion announcement be this year? i forget the cycle @Towelliee
[3:31:03] Hakazo: @LoseAlotLuke yh, around march
[3:31:21] Hakazo: @Towelliee Man honestly, so refreshing seeing u play wow recently <3 - its positive and cozy
[3:31:39] jaydavidsen: @MDKmountaiN Depends, I have had some nice ones and then there's those ones you have to shovel out of the bottle with a spoon :P

[3:37:37] Hakazo: @dan_monk yeah man, its 99% sure to be dragon isles, personally its very high hype <3
[3:37:41] Dagomarus: there comes a time when all content creators who only have one subject need to expand into new areas
[3:37:47] Maego1: Yeah, if i didnt have friends that i play m+ or good guild for chill mythic progress, i would quit probably already :D or just collect stuff
[3:38:04] RealMelorandor: cheer500 Think Pyromancer for good denounced WoW lol?

[3:42:14] dragore87: rich will come back to WoW, he seems to follow the twitch meta a lot
[3:42:16] xPapio: when it comes to new expansion are you more excited for 10.0 or that shadowlands is over?
[3:42:21] LoseAlotLuke: the only think which interests me in the leaks is the "more cosmic 10.1" bit
[3:42:21] Rudric_Ice: I miss madseason
[3:42:42] CrusaderNero: tbh wow players that went over to FF14 is probably a bit unfair to wow. wow is a game many of them have played for 15+ years, while FF14 is/was a brand new MMORPG for them with lots of content

[3:43:22] swordart_19: That msq spreading is real PepeLaugh
[3:43:27] CrusaderNero: I think WAY to many ppl never take breaks from wow. Its not healthy lol

[3:43:56] Korupcija_: it's all about reaction
[3:44:04] RealMelorandor: I think WoW needs a MSQ for an expansion.
[3:44:26] VIRUSplw: but it looks like ff14 isnt super popular on twitch
[3:44:27] Ski751: I also watch msq streamers to remind myself of important plot points.

[3:44:54] swordart_19: @realMelorandor there is campaingg do you play even lul follow quests EZ

[4:32:12] lalelusa: yeah, you can summon Malbog when the NPC glows purple
[4:32:20] trom_w: the tier set is looking good for prot war with necrolord leggy
[4:32:23] Chrisowning: @towelliee  my baby is on its way!
[4:32:34] brazkat: yeah ive had some solid warrior tanks in M+ i was curious of towel's opinion on war tanks in raid even though i only fury/arms dps raids
[4:32:34] cyb0rg_007: arms seems ok still.slams pretty well
[4:32:41] pronkk_: you can summon him at any time

[4:34:09] lalelusa: @pronkk11 the NPC's only giving you his pet for tracking, when they're glowing. Maybe EU is different than NA, but if you can't track Malbog, you can't summon him
[4:34:18] Rygothx: How about Blood DK?
[4:34:20] pronkk_: @pronkk11 yes you can

[4:35:50] gold9871: a guy in the camp you where, follow the paw marks up to its location and tag the meat to summon it
[4:35:56] lalelusa: the npc give you his pet dog and that will allow you to track Malbog and THEN you can summon him
[4:36:00] Zoitack: You can actually run the route of the footsteps even when they are not showing and malbog will appear @towelliee
[4:36:04] gold9871: 50 +
[4:36:08] brewss: its like 3% afaik
[4:36:15] lalelusa: currently on 70+

[5:10:33] osatox: and if they dont?
[5:10:46] dalvynthedrunk: I hope so lol, a third worse version of legion would be so depressing
[5:11:10] NBK_Sethus: I really hope they focus on things that always made WoW great: tier sets, talents, classes and specs. the expansion setting and the "big picture" is not even that important for good player experience.
[5:11:36] itsTwigs_: remember when they would change the talent tree every xpac lol
[5:11:42] mulkon: does someone know if any of the leaks mention how much time passed since we entered the shadowlands? for me they had an amazing opportunity to fast forward like a thousand years and we would come back to discover what happened in Azeroth in this time, kinda of a "reboot"...
[5:11:46] Milanesa_De_Pollo: a mix of the old and new talent system

[5:14:57] Qargory: expac*
[5:15:00] layercake2004: are you thinking a new class will be added in 10
[5:15:05] Dagomarus: When shadowlands started they sais time moved faster in the shadowlands than in azeroth so its more possible we have been gone a few days… i was forced to play the maw opening scenario to have jainas moaning about how long she had been trapped to have it engrained into my mind LUL
[5:15:05] ashwing_: 2 more caches
[5:15:15] Milanesa_De_Pollo: they kind of did that with Argus in a way, too bad it wasn't it's own expansion

[5:19:22] trom_w: one for every covenant for 1000 stygia
[5:19:40] XLcoj: @Towelliee So if between the kiddnaped cinematic, and when we get into the maw , for them its like what? 6 months? for us it was , as fast as we could move to northrend ...so about 1 week  = 6 months, so the time shift is different, almost no time has passed in azeroth
[5:19:52] dalvynthedrunk: so is early march confirmed?
[5:20:03] Scoodles91: mutations should come out end of this month
[5:20:04] Bugszy: hey mate - hey chat

[5:21:18] Skizzurp: any1 in here on ptr? is there a way to craft leggos easily?

[5:27:52] brazkat: viewership wise it was big mistake going to the youtube
[5:28:16] osatox: the last literal MDI event they streamed on twitch as well
[5:28:24] osatox: "The great Push" or whatever
[5:28:25] dalvynthedrunk: I def think they will want to make the double digit xpac reveal an event
[5:28:41] darkterror996: dosent matter the viwership both on twitch and youtube are the same
[5:28:46] KingsandClubs: The wait between 9.2 and 10.0 is gonna be the worst since they don’t have any blizzcon this year to tease the playerbase
[5:28:49] piratechris: There be gnooms down there
[5:28:51] osatox: maybe their exclusivity ended on YT, who knows
[5:29:07] darkterror996: MDI had peak 16k
[5:29:09] CrusaderNero: great push Kappa
[5:29:17] dalvynthedrunk: What was the great push? I didnt even pay attnetion to it
[5:29:20] azdrugr: i think they will tease or announce anything 10.0 related on Gamescom or even E3 or something like this
[5:29:38] NBK_Sethus: it's a miracle anyone can stomach watching the MDI
[5:29:43] Xilice: @osatox that was specifically for The Great Push - we were also allowed to stream it ourself while you are not allowed to do tjat for the MDI - the rules are different
[5:29:53] Lindenir: What's updraft
[5:29:55] DallTV_: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[5:30:03] osatox: @Xilice gotcha, so just something separate
[5:30:10] wildheittv: I think the MDI just needs to adjust to format of the TGP. Or if they keep the MDI, it needs to be at higher key levels than 17s

[6:23:12] Sicknessqt: You need to ring 5 bells and rare spawns
[6:23:21] KaisenSiru: Yeah they spawn when you ring 5 bells at the same time
[6:23:22] super_arcane_boy: I wish they would make retail wow and classic wow separate categories on twitch
[6:23:25] xantivius: @Souliie - You keep whatever lvl you had with the covenants when switching back and forth
[6:23:47] ashwing_: Tormentors

[6:24:43] Trobbels: only doable with necrolord assault tho (golden hand)
[6:24:44] zhc_: giong to work with iced roads 4weird
[6:24:44] rohdey: yeah
[6:24:47] KaisenSiru: The secret hand one yeah. But certain critiera need to be met. Like the necrolord assault has to be up and a specific quest has to be active

[6:24:48] pronkk_: all over bastion
[6:24:54] rohdey: the dungeon ones you can go in on a normal i believe

[7:39:45] starfinder358: yes you are right there
[7:39:55] AnglerQ_: @doughbasedgaming is it? I’ve heard end game raising in retail is much harder than tbc
[7:39:57] pronkk_: the stairs in front of soa, to the right looking at the staris is a tent, theres is a smith who crafts hammer @Towelliee
[7:40:04] AnglerQ_: Raiding*

[7:40:15] prime_minister09: Hi
[7:40:26] toddj76: do they merge realms in classic wow and BC ?
[7:40:30] starfinder358: thats it
[7:40:43] xstraightbrutal: ok ok. maybe next xpac i might be excited to play :D
[7:40:44] prime_minister09: I just joined

[7:41:36] pronkk_: @Contravert me
[7:41:42] mrwalker1966: me
[7:41:42] toddj76: the lack of realm identity near the end of MoP was one of the things that pushed me over the edge
[7:41:46] nhuh: towelliee back to wow mount farming, nature is healing. I can tell 2022 is gonna be better than 21 already
[7:41:56] nocturnal_2195: @toddj76 the only server that's mostly alive is jom gabar the rest are pretty dead

[7:43:11] Screamnsteam: What other mounts you get today?
[7:43:12] Qargory: i got this mount back in bfa Kappa
[7:43:16] toddj76: I don't mean do they merge realms between classic and BC. I mean do they merge them within each separate "game" classic and BC. the way i worded it the first time made it sound like I was asking something else

[7:49:58] alextheory_: did he play all night and took a break?
[7:50:23] toddj76: god I wish they would have just stopped this game at about the timeless isle era of MoP and just kept adding new content but not changing the game itself
