[4:16:14] caradea_: he talked about the bosses, tree boss in WM mostly
[4:16:27] bojackhorseman2004: Really?
[4:16:30] bojackhorseman2004: am i stupid?
[4:16:34] AIemaan: prob
[4:16:37] bojackhorseman2004: Maybe i zoned out xD
[4:16:58] bojackhorseman2004: i dont have anything open except stream, but sometimes i stare at the wall blankly my mom says
[4:17:12] bojackhorseman2004: ok he said waycrest tree boss
[4:17:18] caradea_: happens to the best of us
[4:17:19] bojackhorseman2004: becuse you have to kite adds, i already failed on that
[4:17:46] caradea_: healing the thorn debuff is a bigger problem i think
[4:18:05] bojackhorseman2004: I asked another streamer about it, he said people get pvp trinket
[4:18:07] bojackhorseman2004: to get out
[4:18:11] Shkafche: @bojackhorseman2004 no mostly is cuz of the thorns that goes out on ppl u shuld be able to kite just fine
[4:18:11] kelly_mac06: they do
[4:18:41] bojackhorseman2004: ok, what is our spot heal healing rotatation?
[4:18:51] bojackhorseman2004: LB->cenarion ward->rejuve regrowth spam?
[4:18:56] bojackhorseman2004: or skip rejuve?
[4:19:02] caradea_: dont use rejuv
[4:19:20] bojackhorseman2004: not ever?
[4:19:23] caradea_: swiftmend into natures swiftness into regrwoth is a massive heal
[4:19:32] bojackhorseman2004: its 2 mastery points with cultivaiton, which many top Rdruids are taking
[4:20:07] bojackhorseman2004: so i need to make sure everyone has a swiftmendable hot on them
[4:20:17] caradea_: i use it only for one thing, the add packs in rise
[4:20:28] bojackhorseman2004: Hmm, add pack in rise
[4:20:39] bojackhorseman2004: you mean where the yellow stuff has to be removed?
[4:20:41] caradea_: you dont have to put it on a mage
[4:21:02] bojackhorseman2004: ohh
[4:21:10] caradea_: no, the dragon packs that just spam aoe. last pack in the dungeon and the one after first boss
[4:21:11] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[4:21:16] bojackhorseman2004: so i can always keep lb on the non mage dps
[4:21:19] bojackhorseman2004: thats much easier
[4:21:20] caradea_: yes
[4:21:52] bojackhorseman2004: ok, so WC tree boss and flameshock boss in thrones are the only hard bosses for us?
[4:21:54] bojackhorseman2004: and yasma
[4:23:14] bojackhorseman2004: is third boss rng or preditermed?
[4:23:16] xGuiha: @jdotb excited for vexxamus next season? :)
[4:23:22] bojackhorseman2004: i have an WA that tells me what the boss does
[4:23:31] caradea_: the casts are predictable
[4:23:38] Dayoka: @bojackhorseman2004 the amount of bolts per person is rng
[4:23:38] bojackhorseman2004: what is rng then?

[4:23:44] bojackhorseman2004: oh okey
[4:23:56] theskot: yeah can get crazy unlucky on her its v lame
[4:23:58] bojackhorseman2004: so if people die and blame healing i can say its rng
[4:24:03] theskot: exactly
[4:24:07] caradea_: ^
[4:24:20] bojackhorseman2004: and can anyone say how i should bait on that boss?
[4:24:25] bojackhorseman2004: just stand super far away?
[4:24:41] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:24:46] caradea_: pref have someone else bait so you can do some cat damage
[4:25:19] caradea_: but the idea is that your team knows where the pull is going to be, so they dont get pulled into ice/flame patches
[5:02:15] lambowarlock: @jdotb what health potions are better in keys.. the ones that heal u little but put a hot on you or the ones that heal for a lot and hurt u a little?
