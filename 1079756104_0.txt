[3:48:05] ohnot___her: Wait do you really have a survival hunter or is thaat just the year of the spear meme LOL
[3:48:10] Superfragger: @beastmage86 what do you mean long time lol... bosses took months to beat in vanilla era expansions
[3:49:54] CritcobainTV: Seems like tazavesh still bugged as fuck
[3:50:19] DiranJei: Diablo 3 music
[3:50:20] DiranJei: ?
[3:50:21] CritcobainTV: Mail boss cant pick up packages

[3:50:42] mitchumtx: mitchum69 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:50:45] CritcobainTV: and then they're bugged out
[3:51:46] Densetsu_: If ur mail boss is bugged, run out of the dungoen, relog, go back in. Fixed for most people.
[3:51:57] Densetsu_: Did for my grp
[3:52:03] TheKillerHamy: !sylvanas
[3:52:03] Moobot: @TheKillerHamy No, Towelliee has not seen the Sylvanas cutscene yet. He is waiting until he actually beats the raid to watch it.
[3:52:11] Bayne77: all this pee talk, brb bio...
[3:52:36] grumpy_dan: @beastmage86 well, its not vanilla anymore - and players did not know a lot back then. how long did it take to kill denathrius & nzoth?
[3:52:57] FrankTizzle: monkaS
[3:53:04] xxKrayzie: toxic af^^
[3:53:05] Superfragger: lol bit toxic
[3:53:08] kekdaddyflex: reeeee
[3:53:15] T0MMYT: KEKW
[3:53:17] CritcobainTV: Toxic? what
[3:53:26] mitchumtx: Not toxic at all, its about getting shit doner
[3:53:27] The_Tank_Man_X: This is why I stopped raiding, and ultimately stopped playing KEKW
[3:53:28] Kneckt: thats not toxic thats good raid leading
[3:53:33] CritcobainTV: So telling people if they can't do the mechanics that they're gonna get sat is toxic? KEKW
[3:53:37] CritcobainTV: Snowflakes man
[3:53:41] MarquisLek: thats just being honest
[3:53:46] Kneckt: ^
[3:53:50] mitchumtx: right, Crit.
[3:53:52] mavericks312: he just spitting facts
[3:53:59] kokochris: here we go danH
[3:54:07] CritcobainTV: People these days are so soft bro. "mommy he hurt my feelings"
[3:54:07] mitchumtx: People calling that toxic is just casuals that never got CE.
[3:54:10] Superfragger: its the reeee when you're on day 2 of a new raid that is toxic, not stating facts
[3:54:12] T0MMYT: the world needs Snowflakes
[3:54:14] Kaype92: if you think that's toxic then you missed the sparty days lol
[3:55:00] FrankTizzle: Well, some are new or aren't familiar with the environment of semi0serious raiding
[3:55:10] T0MMYT: i wanna hear motivation
[3:55:13] FrankTizzle: semi-serious*
[3:55:18] kekdaddyflex: not toxic, just peope who act like that are usually lowly employees or unemployed so they talk big in wow

[3:55:50] The_Enygma: there's a way to educate people on someone's mistakes without going "dude you're a fukin moron"
[3:55:56] JustTrim: what went wrong there? i didnt see
[3:56:17] FrankTizzle: I mean, there is a sense of urgency. These guilds are usually in the running and trying to get the Top 100 Hall of Fame achievement
[3:56:23] mitchumtx: It's simple, just dont do dumb things and you wont be called out
[3:56:24] JustTrim: @The_Enygma he said it they consistently fuck up, aka they cant grasp the concept, they get benched
[3:56:45] FrankTizzle: and top 100 guilds getting hall of fame on horde side is a pretty tight race
[3:56:53] Aandolas: Every single mechanic in this raid is super simple..... its one of the easiest raids in a long time. Its super easy but you need to know all the mechanics by memory. callouts will typically be too late.
[3:56:56] Horseweave: If you considered Sparty toxic, something is very wrong with your view on life.
[3:56:57] JustTrim: painsmith living up to his name though
[3:56:57] DevilSpire: i agree
[3:57:12] FrankTizzle: D: R

[3:58:18] CritcobainTV: so toxic
[3:58:21] Superfragger: this is not limit lol
[3:58:35] mitchumtx: It's like your job IRL, you fuck up once or twice fine but that third time you gonna get that coaching and on probation
[3:58:42] CritcobainTV: Doesn't matter if it's limit. the same thing applies. If one or two people are holding everyone else up, you're gone
[3:58:45] CritcobainTV: it's a simple fact
[3:58:49] The_Tank_Man_X: Its a game not a job for 99.9%

[4:28:16] FrankTizzle: Pug Killer boss for sure
[4:28:18] Luuin: was some spicy skill overlap
[4:28:42] FrankTizzle: The amount of rage in pug groups during this fight
[4:29:18] Madox99: I have a clipp for it if you wanna watch it
[4:29:18] StateFarm206: This raid is not pug friendly KEKW

[4:30:17] LadyKei: What is pug?
[4:30:23] Konnartist: back to having to be social Kappa
[4:30:25] StateFarm206: im main swapping so im missing a week of raiding FeelsBadMan
[4:30:28] FrankTizzle: PUG = Pick Up Group
[4:30:36] FrankTizzle: Like randos you would invite via LFG tool
[4:30:43] LadyKei: Oh okay thanks Frank
[4:30:47] loktar_ogars: Tos?
[4:31:17] JustTrim: pools on archimonde :D
[4:31:20] StateFarm206: I agree
[4:31:27] StateFarm206: This raid is one of the worse for pugs lol
[4:31:30] mitchumtx: Archimonde was definitely a pug killer because of a simple mech as pools
[4:32:57] ohnot___her: What lego is your warrior running?

[4:33:22] Secondbreakfasttt: your ilevels were low tho
[4:33:22] StateFarm206: the fight was over turned i thought at least
[4:33:38] Secondbreakfasttt: now your gear is fine
[4:34:04] JustTrim: hows everyone finding this raid so far? i had great fun on the first half :D
[4:34:09] mitchumtx: Archimonde was my first Mythic boss kill :D
[4:34:23] mitchumtx: CE**
[4:34:36] Secondbreakfasttt: ofcors that was a DH LUL
[4:34:37] FrankTizzle: @LadyKei Most PUG mentality is pretty cutthroat nowadays (the ones that try to finish the entire raid anyways); because the entire social aspect is removed, you are invited based on your achives/logs/item level alone; should you mess up mechanics more than 1 or 2 times, forget to bring consumables, expected to watch raid boss fights beforehand and/or just unlucky because the raid lead doesn't like you, you can expect to be kicked after 1 or 2 wipes

[4:35:46] ShrenTheOrc: do you think blizzard will announce something at gamescom this year
[4:35:48] artiBEAST: @franktizzle yep. And if you’re “off meta” good luck getting an invite at all
[4:36:00] artiBEAST: Like bro it’s normal there’s no meta
[4:36:03] FrankTizzle: @artiBEAST Yep
[4:36:17] ShrenTheOrc: cool
[4:36:31] jerexify: @Towelliee First night for MRGL, our Heroic raid team. We got 5/10 Normal, so not too shabby for us casuals. :D
[4:36:42] snowman_gaming365: !sylvanas
[4:36:43] Moobot: @snowman_gaming365 No, Towelliee has not seen the Sylvanas cutscene yet. He is waiting until he actually beats the raid to watch it.
[4:37:04] Horseweave: @jerexify Is the fight REALLY that hard?
[4:37:07] FrankTizzle: If streamers/high end raiders say on stream that your spec sucks for the patch, you better reroll to an alt or have amazing logs or overcompensate your item level to get invited
[4:37:09] LadyKei: @FrankTizzle Ah okay I haven't played WoW in like a year and a half so yeah I didn't know what pug meant but that makes sense especially with the elitism WoW tends to have!
[4:37:40] FrankTizzle: I mean all these problems can be avoided if you join a guild
[4:37:56] jerexify: @Horseweave I mean, /shrug? We're on this fight, just on Normal, and yeah, we're kinda stuck. But again, we're a lot more casual than most raiding teams.
[4:38:05] JustTrim: same @jerexify
[4:38:17] JustTrim: the fight is just unforgiving and over tuned lol
[4:38:37] jerexify: I'm thoroughly enjoying the raid so far, that's for sure. The mechanics are really neat.
[4:38:38] LadyKei: @FrankTizzle True
[4:38:46] Secondbreakfasttt: man has a point lmao
[4:38:52] artiBEAST: @franktizzle yea unless you basically outgear the content you are trying to join you’re not getting in
[4:38:58] FrankTizzle: Fights are balanced around item level and having a good portion of the raid with their domination set bonus
[4:39:02] Horseweave: @jerexify I mean no offense.I just heard some of the damage is overturned
[4:39:14] Horseweave: in a lot of fights
[4:39:26] skiller2b_: @FrankTizzle "Joining a guild" really doesn't solve these issues. But I understand You.
[4:39:28] JustTrim: same, especially eye of the jailer and ner'zhul, such fun fights
[4:39:37] jerexify: @Horseweave I honestly don't get into the details of it that much. It could be, yeah, but we just kinda keep ramming our head into it until we get lucky, usually.
[4:39:49] Secondbreakfasttt: this fight is overtuned for sure, even limit wiped on this several times
[4:41:03] Horseweave: @jerexify I would not advise that. You'll get a concussion.
[4:41:23] jerexify: lol

[6:36:19] Wildside1177: @YassssQueenSlay Simple solution when you run into trolls like that. After you die, run out of the grave yard as a ghost. Get a beer and collect your mark. You don't rez outsside the GY so they can't kill you for honour.
