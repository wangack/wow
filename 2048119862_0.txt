[0:47:16] Pheoris: yeah maybe I don't think I'm mentally this old because I don't have kids hahaha... or maybe because I smacked the crap out of my head at 19, at skate country.

I went to a Chiro and Neurologist. They mentioned the discs and syringohydromyelia, but I ended up taking magnesium, and I haven't had that problem since. I still get charley horses, in my back, usually when I'm going to sleep, but they don't happen as much now that I just got a new mattress. I can

[1:01:48] Pheoris: @sl1nky1981 lmao
[1:01:50] shineypikachu2010: its sucks its double on use but
[1:02:07] misomander: genesaur isnt thaaaat bad
[1:02:08] destrominater: blood is good. you don’t take damage or have to stand in melee.
[1:02:10] Pheoris: should i try to make @sl1nky1981 laugh out loud? I have better ones. lol
[1:02:14] misomander: pips is a solid replacement for nymue tho
[1:02:22] misomander: its prob like nymue > pips > genesaur
[1:02:31] sl1nky1981: you definitely should @Pheoris
[1:02:43] Daemoos6: It's pronouced: Ni mou é
[1:02:46] misomander: i dont personally like nymue in m+ either its kinda clunky
[1:02:55] misomander: a lot of people prefer branch instead
[1:03:05] mentosz09: @Pheoris I still like the coin flip clip haha
[1:03:07] misomander: iterations prob
[1:03:23] sl1nky1981: I have Nymue and Beleralos (whatever it's called) on my lock and hate having 2 on-use trinkets
[1:03:43] misomander: yeah its especially clunky on warlock since you have a lot of setup
[1:03:58] misomander: it doesnt feel too too bad on evoker with double on use

[1:20:08] sacrilege_69: yea minimum R5 they can if they use orb of insight for 50 mettle ...and they better use it if they charging 10k+ for a one button craft
[1:21:01] misomander: idk i feel like people asking anything over 5k for r5 is just scamming at this point
[1:21:05] Masqerader: a laugh when people post rank 5 lariats for 500g to craft and they wonder why no one touches it
[1:21:29] Masqerader: 280
[1:21:32] Masqerader: last i saw
[1:21:38] misomander: they always reply "well i have to use mettle for r5" and im like... what else are you spending it on? i have like 10k on my alt i never log into and it costs like 50 mettle for r5
[1:21:46] Masqerader: 277 atm
[1:24:03] Ronangic: my main is a BS and JC... i don't  have a to mettle just laying around... 5k is a fair price for something you can do on a limited basis
[1:24:25] sacrilege_69: you know when shadowflame patches were implemented in the game...i had around 10k mettle already on my Leatherworker and when i started crafting the guarantied procs with the mettle ....literally made 5M gold untill their price droped for weeks time...and only managed to spend around 6k mettle
[1:24:25] Masqerader: duct table some cardboard to a pillow, bam, headrest
[1:25:22] Masqerader: wonder how many recrafts it took
[1:26:03] Masqerader: ya
[1:26:07] Ronangic: he just might not have high enough skill in necks
[1:26:13] misomander: they use their own mats
[1:26:17] misomander: which for jc is like dirt cheap
[1:26:25] misomander: yeah had to go back and forth
[1:26:26] Ronangic: if it isn't r5, there is a recraft button but the crafter has to supply the mats
[1:26:45] Masqerader: i don't even make people give me mats to do it, just give me gold and i will use my own
[1:27:03] sacrilege_69: the price of shadowflame patches were ridicilous week one was around 60-70k and then droped to 30k...the ressourcenes and the multi craft made the gold practically each time it proced was flat 30-60k and boy ohh boy everybody buying that shadowflame patch was the best embelishments before the nerfs
[1:28:01] RoboMaximillion: the neck counts yes
[1:28:08] sacrilege_69: yea
[1:28:12] sacrilege_69: it counts the neck too
[1:28:47] Ronangic: gives a purple seed at least
[1:29:02] Ronangic: they can lead to mounts and stuff

[2:43:41] Stormrazer78: maybe it’s female can driving
[2:44:11] Masqerader: @ermymunster I remember seeing a road completely bogged down in the us over an inch of snow in like Georgia lol
[2:44:22] Swiftar: My area of the US doesn't care about snow. I moved while it was snowing with 6ft of snow already on the ground
[2:44:29] ermymunster: @Masqerader Yeah, but it checks out because they almost never get snow, they're just not prepared for it
[2:44:46] domick17: even a city or province
[2:44:52] RalgorStreams: in georgia there are no salt trucks so the roads in the south are far worse than the roads in cities where snow is common. no infrastructure
[2:45:06] Karn1987: so one guy recently mowed down 6 pl in a van and tryed to clame sovrin citsen in quort
[2:45:13] Karn1987: cort

[2:45:36] ermymunster: Oh god don't start the sovereign citizen thing
[2:45:47] MrTheColor9: We get more ice than snow and i live in the middle of nowhere so dito im stuck in my house till things thaw out

[4:38:53] homewrecker101: atoc glad
[4:39:08] riatla7: I mean
[4:39:13] riatla7: You can buy aotc
[4:39:18] Ealdfox: data mining =/= it's gonna happen
[4:39:20] trinilime: did they actually announce that it is coming into trading post?
[4:39:29] homewrecker101: We’d like to dispel this particular rumor. At this time, we do not plan to offer mounts or other skill-based prestige rewards from achievements such as Cutting Edge or Ahead of the Curve or Gladiator in the Trading Post. We’re very excited about what’s coming to the Trading Post in February and beyond, as each month, we intend to offer fun new rewards and themed cosmetics. We’ll post a complete preview of everything coming in February soon. Thank you for all of your feedback on this.
[4:39:34] StreamElements:  Did you miss one of the playthroughs or would like to watch it again? The new channel Luxthos Plays is now live -> https://www.youtube.com/@luxthosplays
[4:39:48] Ealdfox: People just assumed the mount was coming because of data mining
[4:40:09] Khadgarlic: You cant buy my love you milionnaire streamer
[4:40:10] Ealdfox: Like always
[4:40:27] umcharama: People thought gladiator arena mounts were coming to the trading post, and they freaked out.
[4:40:31] homewrecker101: yup as always
[4:40:39] Daemoos6: Mount is probably coming from SoO Pandamonium event in next patch
[4:40:42] trinilime: the clarification is nice though. nice to have communication
[4:41:08] Convectus: i agree, fomo mounts or limited time mounts are lame. let me get everything
[4:41:27] trinilime: old cosmetics are such a good opportunity for new content

[4:42:53] trinilime: the way the other PVP mounts work is nice. where you win X games in arena for current season to get current mount then you can still get any of the old ones
[4:42:53] homewrecker101: people are gonna complain no matter what
[4:43:08] Ealdfox: Everything was harder when I was younger luxthoWink
[4:43:16] umcharama: What's your fave class in WoW when it comes to playing mechanics? Damage output etc. doesn't matter.
[4:43:37] Masqerader: lol, tbc glad wasn't hard, just run rogue druid and u won
[4:44:04] Arsong: well this morning drove to the UPS to see where the phone i ordered was. It is there its on one of the trailers, but they have a huge backlog of packages that they are trying to get through to get to people that hasnt gotten to it. went there around 10 cause site says they close at 12 than open again at 3. But they got stressed out and closed at 11 so i sat waiting to get this info for 3 almost 4 hours just for some info
[4:44:12] Effin_Steffin: Back in my day... luxthoBoomer
[4:44:17] Lemon_King: eh, drop a recolor on the trading post. Thats fine.
[4:44:24] LuiBMHunter: i've only got 228 mounts and I hardly ever see most of em as it is
[4:44:38] Sarocus: The prestige was in having those items back then. now they're just old items
[4:44:50] Masqerader: Oh I know, I got Lieutenant general and conqueror back in vanilla and I can only show those titles on those chars, I didn't care when they became rated title rewards either
[4:46:08] mccrackasaur: HAHAHAHA
[4:46:23] PaganFlute: i mean i like it to have that unique transmog from my vanilla priest staff benediction as kinda prestige. Still have the staff on my bank from vanilla days. But in the end its somewhat ego ^^

[4:50:18] Aggy: meeting is over back to my couch luxthoSleep
[4:50:46] sl1nky1981: Ele Shaman have some of the coolest spell effects
