[1:21:51] Renfuryy: National health institute: Therefore, it may be helpful to tell patients to expect habit formation (based on daily repetition) to take around 10 weeks. Our experience is that people are reassured to learn that doing the behaviour gets progressively easier; so they only have to maintain their motivation until the habit forms.

[5:03:50] gabbigjee97: It was for yourself
[5:03:52] Renfuryy: The tired, “heavy” feeling is a “protective mechanism” that forces people to close their lids and lubricate the eye’s sensitive outer layer, or cornea. This is accompanied by a feeling of tiredness. So your eyes are just tired after a long day of blinking and the muscles need some relaxation and your eyes need more moisture.

When you are looking at a screen (tv, display, etc..) the eye blinks much less and the surface area dries out, thats how the eye is damaging itself, to counter it there is advice to take little breaks (optimaly every 20 minutes for 20 seconds) but you can also use eye drops i have no idea whitch brand is good in the US but in Europe HYLOS is among the very good brands
