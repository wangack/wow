[0:31:15] AtAStargate: the guard finally have something, let us have this lol
[0:31:16] DKGaming88: Space marines are OP compared to a standard human.
[0:31:16] Kenchucky: i think they could add in a space marine defector as a boss
[0:31:17] Chatting0nAaYoinkedPhone: @ThisFlameIsFire not doom maybe, a lil bit'ish ?
[0:31:18] Koffiekoekje: I mean you'd obliterate everything like you do now Kappa

[0:31:30] Mafesto: @ButteringMyToast so like warframe but slower paced
[0:31:31] Morendur: actual marine would be OP, but maaaybe you could justify a scout on loan to the inquisition ?
[0:31:34] affflackk: Does this play like destiny? Like PoE raids with a group type deal or just a single player shooter
[0:31:38] gojss: is there replayablity in this game or is it like vermintide2 and just campaigns and then nothing new ?
[0:31:39] Koffiekoekje: Instead of turning it F2P after 5 years they add Space Marines

[0:49:36] BreadBauru: @DKGaming88 Thats what I tried to say, like I said Vermintide AND Left 4 Dead because the person that asked might not know what Vermintide is
[0:49:43] Gendaif: @shroud there is another map called ‚Äúthrones‚Äù something, its honestly one of the best looking maps in games history imo. So insane

[0:51:06] Odzog: @AmriSleepy it was when he loaded in, but they got replaced by players
[0:51:11] YackoBros: is this game cross play?
[0:51:16] AmriSLEEPY: @Odzog nice
[0:51:21] romansincivvies: they shouldnt have nerfed dodging from vt2
[0:51:25] wdddw: @wdddw ah that s why
[0:51:25] 420_no_scope: are there still crashing issues?

[0:51:55] psyrius88: @420_no_scope Some crashes have been fixed, but we're still working on fixing more crashes
[0:51:57] ToxyBoxy: @romansincivvies isnt dodging way stronger in darktide? because it breaks enemy "lock"
[0:51:58] romansincivvies: @420_no_scope the performance is worse compared to the pre release beta
[0:51:58] sp33dyal: omg this pepeLost is so adorable
[0:51:58] saintxkaos: is there a raid for this game? beside 4 players?
[0:51:58] 14mobs: @romansincivvies i mean there is sprinting and sliding now
[0:52:01] BBQPaintchips: I like how the lasgun sight is like a church window.  Gothic firearms
[0:52:01] BreadBauru: @shroud Reminder that the sword you got equipped has a parry as the "Special weapon skill"
[0:52:01] ChefMorris: what difficulty is this
[0:52:01] BeefBriskets: @romansincivvies they tied dodging into each weapon now, light weapons dodge farther and more often I think?
[0:52:06] purepell: why is this guy so popular
[0:52:07] romansincivvies: @ToxyBoxy it did that in vt2 as well
[0:52:09] Hooch0TV: @shroud you passed a scirpure
[0:52:13] maqqii: @ChefMorris 2
[0:52:13] JL4W: chat can you play solo with AI

[0:52:18] Ez_Fn_Pz: @purepell why arent u
[0:52:21] Hooch0TV: @shroud they make an ominous almost like whispering noise
[0:52:23] the_mistorteen: what do you think about this game?
[0:52:26] Odzog: @420_no_scope occasionally but you can reconnect to the mission
[0:52:33] FLOOB___: no WoW? ):
[0:52:33] thicccboyben: the music in this game is fucking sick
[0:52:34] Kas50: @purepell please leave you're annoying and negative
[0:52:34] romansincivvies: @BeefBriskets thats also the same in vt2, the problem is that dodging pauses stamina now
[0:52:35] maqqii: 2/5 @ChefMorris
[0:52:42] LethalBro: catJam
[0:52:42] saintxkaos: @purepell if you dont know then you dont know i guess :shurg

[0:52:46] mr_brightside0213: peepoDJ

[0:53:15] purepell: wow tonnes of white knights here. I know he used to play CS back in the day, just wondering how he's managed to be so prolific on twitch. chill out
[0:53:15] dawnniii: @purepell hes the gaming warlord  wdym? :)
[0:53:18] romansincivvies: @fleshhy its weaker because dodging causes stamina to pause regenerating
[0:53:19] Mugungo: gota use the auspex to find stuff for the mission, hit 4

[1:04:40] Valvega: @Valvega oh okay, like 2 diff?
[1:04:46] TKOBooM: @flameyclouds find a mission that says it has scriptures... then find them hidden around the map
[1:04:54] ytapzz: seems like more of a hack n slash game huh
[1:04:57] HEintHz: sup boi
[1:04:58] idiotboyjr: @flameyclouds you start a mission that has scriptures as a secondary objective then you look for them on the ground

[1:05:43] ynzaen: first time i see someone with a bolter in this
[1:05:44] sarg1010: @TrickModeX 1 or 2
[1:05:49] TKOBooM: @ytapzz KEKW
[1:05:53] Nikushaa: @skinnakid that one requires heresy, heresy becomes much more manageable at level 30, also make sure to use a shotgun
[1:05:54] osefmarcher: the soundtrack in this game is sooo good
[1:05:56] shinj1n: @tkoboom prob sounded wittier in your head but you cool
[1:05:57] romansincivvies: yeah it has to be heresy
[1:06:00] Valvega: @TrickModeX I'd say 2 or 3, 1 diff gives you 4 wounds
[1:06:03] im0tept: ammo fiend
[1:06:05] BeefBriskets: @skinnakid that penance for veteran is dummy hard because you and allies get more ammo every time you guys kill and elite within cohesion range of each other :/

[1:06:48] GettinShotWithTheBoyz: do you have more than 100 toughness? OMEGALUL
[1:06:49] aradim: your companions have passives that reduce your damage taken
[1:06:49] mrblond5: sniper maybe they do a lot of dmg
[1:06:50] Etera: veteran shield is bugged atm so you take more damage through it
[1:06:50] xMadJester: That Baelife is a GIGACHAD
[1:06:50] SirWinstonian: toughness is bugged atm, you take huge damage at 100% toughness

[1:06:58] Dalenberg: @shroud there is a bug for characters with toughness over 200
[1:06:59] romansincivvies: @Memorydump they didnt have a microtransaction shop on day 1 of a broken game in vt2 though
[1:06:59] sarg1010: @mrblond5 There wasn't a sniper
[1:07:00] Gendaif: @shroud veteran is bugged right now, all ur melee damage goes straight to hp
[1:07:00] SpookyLoops: Veteran I think takes most damage from melee (but has most toughness/shield)
[1:07:00] SkinnaKid: yea heresy my b i confused the names. but yea im struggling lol
[1:07:03] Mugungo: toughness isnt an overshield, it has melee bleed through
[1:07:09] SpookyLoops: Ohhh
[1:07:10] PrimeBaws: vet is hard mode rn
[1:07:11] mrblond5: ohh so is bug
[1:07:11] ItsGary: there's a bug with toughness. more toughness you have the more damage that bleeds through if you are 100 or higher. they missed a percentage modifer
[1:07:17] delamain21: @Mugungo Yeah, but not that much
[1:07:22] TKOBooM: @shinj1n catKISS

[1:07:48] rjyapp: Theres a toughness bug right now where the damage bleeds through regardless
[1:07:49] Valvega: is the toughness bug an everyone thing or is it vet only? cus I was playing psyker and took more hits than my vet

[1:08:09] romansincivvies: @Memorydump they didnt seem to need it in vt1 and 2
[1:08:11] delamain21: Damage is supposed to correspond with toughness percentage. 100% toughness = 100% damage blocked. 90% = 90% of damage etc
[1:08:12] unholsum: u were the  lowest lvl player

[1:08:35] Blueberrypiie: @Redfuryin u sure it wasnt endless horde mode?
[1:08:35] Gendaif: @shroud u should try the combat knife, if gives u insnae mobility, also u can double bind slide and dash since they dont hurt eachother and give u a consistent dash slide always

[1:09:09] idiotboyjr: @snaxident there is but you hav to go in to your audio settings and set it to push to talk
[1:09:12] reversed28: lvl3 is the most fun
[1:09:15] Gendaif: @shroud u should try the combat knife, if gives u insnae mobility, also u can double bind slide and dash since they dont hurt eachother and give u a consistent dash slide which is the best mobility rn in general
[1:09:22] bnans: i will play one or 2 with you if you want
[1:09:24] delamain21: @romansincivvies The change to 100% toughness = 100% damage mitigation was the thing that caused the bug.
[1:09:24] buzrikk: nobody talks because the default setting for microphones is "muted"
[1:09:35] asaltyfilipinoulrick: lol the knife runners cringe
[1:09:37] romansincivvies: make toughness break a lot faster on melee and make it an overshield
[1:09:44] delamain21: Before it was 90% yeah
[1:09:47] Gen1us_Fps: hjk
[1:09:50] romansincivvies: @delamain21 really?

[1:09:56] Soulrot_: @buzrikk yeah but i think at the high difficulties that may change XD
[1:09:59] Redfuryin: @asaltyfilipinoulrick nope, lol it wasnt and we ran away from the horde and they kept spawning even at the end of the map. ended with 3100 kills
[1:10:03] delamain21: @romansincivvies Yeah, for full release. Take a look at patch notes

[1:11:17] Gendaif: @shroud like change ur dash to ctrl ull see
[1:11:21] asaltyfilipinoulrick: knifes are fun but it tempted you to play solo
[1:11:22] romansincivvies: @ToxyBoxy if you think that having 100 hp will make you able to not block then you have never played vt1 2 or darktide on difficulties above veteran / level 2
[1:11:26] pairedformula1: is the imperial edition worth it?
[1:11:27] abaraba_: sprint
[1:11:28] Gendaif: yes
[1:11:35] JesusCryzII: 5Head
[1:11:38] asaltyfilipinoulrick: @pairedformula1 yes? a lot of stuff you get
[1:11:47] Nikushaa: do the tag on LMB, makes life much easier
[1:11:48] WastedLive: @Blueberrypiie yoooo hahah that's f up xD
[1:11:49] onetimecrimson: is there a preparation routine before the mission for specific circumstances?
[1:11:51] Blueberrypiie: @pairedformula1 if you like the skins sure if not just get the 7k bundle
[1:11:52] turtlesmcgee: toughness isn't suppose to be shield, its suppose to help protect you from ranged mobs and get accidentally hit once or twice. Your main way to avoid taking damage should be blocking and dodging.
[1:11:55] romansincivvies: i personally put dodge on space and jump on shift
[1:11:57] pairedformula1: @asaltyfilipinoulrick ok
[1:11:59] frizzydrizzy: !lurk
[1:12:02] Gendaif: also turn stationary dodge on
[1:12:05] fleshhy: @GettinShotWithTheBoyz I did get the skins but had to link/unlink from atoma

[1:13:03] sp33dyal: it kinda reset your FOV so would make sense if it reset your settings as well ml7Shrug
[1:13:04] Cloudkiller: does anyone play on controller? How does it feel?
[1:13:07] romansincivvies: @turtlesmcgee if toughness was an overshield you would still need to block and dodge, it would just work like an extra health bar that you can regenerate, the lower healthbar would be unrecoverable
[1:13:13] ImThePai: any crush so far chat?
[1:13:21] Realist4ever: @aradim He did fix them yesterday after launch
[1:13:25] romansincivvies: if you never block you get melted on malice and above

[1:13:31] maqqii: RTX
[1:13:32] IIIIRuthlessIIII: why they even give the option for MB now nobody uses it
[1:13:33] gaben829: stationary dodge, while not moving and you press space you will dodge backwards rather than jump.
[1:13:34] romansincivvies: even with overshield
[1:13:36] maqqii: RTX BatChest
[1:13:39] Gendaif: @shroud u can test the movement in the meat grinder area to see if u like it
[1:13:47] Blueberrypiie: @ImThePa big crush on the sisters  of battle yes
[1:14:02] Nikushaa: @romansincivvies if you dodge well you only ever get hit at full toughness, which blocks all damage
[1:14:06] Maxhdi: ABI WAS GEHT

[2:54:32] StreamElements: Mike plays the Evoker class, the new expansion class and race for dragonflight.
[2:54:33] matching_towels: Hpal is an interesting first healer choice. Can be a bit difficult in melee, but once you master weaving in damage it has a higher skill ceiling. Admittedly I sucked at it and prefer ranged healers, you‚Äôll be fine I‚Äôm sure
[2:54:40] kimohunt: yes cause crusader strike is your baseline spell to generate holy power. like the basic
[2:54:42] expell_406: it's your builder for holy power
[2:54:45] ssyphersteele: i think crusader strike gets removed by her spinny hammer thing and it generates holy power so you definitely use it
[2:54:48] Elvo36: it changes to hammer at level 10
[2:54:48] JustAnts: Crusader strike is single target. Hammer of rightstuf is the AOE

[3:22:08] theclayzer: @kristamariexx they are hard to come by unless you accidently find one. I suggest an addon that track em for you :D
[3:22:27] Draggore: yeah you can't see them in the map cause you found them. howerver if you know the rough area they are in you can still take her to them

[3:23:55] theclayzer: @kristamariexx No problem :D If you don't want to  use addon for it, a tip is that you get a text in the chat if you're nearby one. Something like: "your dragon senses a glyph nearby."

[3:32:52] flogenos: I played Elder Scrolls Online quite a bit, and with the new update and Microsoft hopefully helping clean up ActivisionBlizzard, I tried the free trial of WoW.

[3:44:56] PBRbiter: the top tier of the xpac comes with 30 days of game time, which when you include the character boost and the mount n stuff isn't THAT bad a deal. still pricey af though

[3:47:10] femboykiss: Prodilli246 That depends on how you play, If you only do it by farming (Herbalism, Skinning, Mining) or crafting (Crafting armor and weapons for people) it can take some time, If you sell boosts (For gold, not money!) it's easier to earn the amount, I think a WoW token is about 300.000 Gold right now, So it'll need a good chunk of time investment to get that money

[4:29:29] Kiyomei: Will you try the pvp ?
[4:29:32] joseftonyy: Chat i need help
[4:29:33] McLarge: Outlaw was ridiculous in Shadowlands PvP. Haven't really heard much about it in Dragonflight so far

[4:30:44] nitro_city: and enhancement ;)

[4:31:28] Kr1LLzz: @Slade8475 cheers m8 - the target frames look so good now!
[4:31:32] TrickModeX: Wind walker monks are always very good at expansion start cause their base values are very good, and they are very good in mythics always because they have very good aoe
[4:31:34] samsggz: Shadow priests  pepeSmoke
[4:31:43] RyfenVII: Skill can many times overcome dps meta gaps, just learn your stuff
[4:32:20] Slade8475: @Kr1LLzz oh yea, that's not default. The bars, and party frames, mini map are. He's using ThreatPlate for target frames i believe
[4:32:22] LimitzDK: probably based off single target dmg
[4:32:30] yopiz_tv: so you skip it
[4:32:36] xhairbait: it's a Backseat Addon lol
[4:32:36] bernash: Prot warrior is insane. Soloing like everything with light seeing your health bar move lmao

[4:33:30] Ziiirox: yeah the addon cant read how many mobs so hard for aoe
[4:33:41] khaled1hit: this game trying to be silkroad but . silkroad still the best :D :)
[4:33:41] Kiyomei: It's not a good addon to get used too though, should remove it asap and get a feel for it yourself.
[4:33:46] Kr1LLzz: @Slade8475 make sense, it looked too pretty to be Blizzards! LUL
[4:33:47] McLarge: Something that really helped me out when I was learning Retail WoW was realizing that every rotation is priority based, nothing has a static rotation.
[4:33:56] Hascius: Chat, what did Mike do regarding the world quest to get higher ilvl?

[4:36:12] Oriminally: Am i the only 1 whose mount animation bugs sometimes and doesnt show. it just appears under my char

[4:37:28] ChubbyMikey: we used to, but it's FAR from current now
[4:37:43] JonSnowID: @mclarge so you pay $15 a month to play this game?
[4:37:52] Kas50: @PapiiCholo but if you play smart you can play COMPLETELY FREE - gold = blizzard $'s for sub fees and even expansion fees
[4:38:13] JonSnowID: oh got it
[4:38:16] McLarge: @PapiiCholo Yes, unless you grind out enough gold to pay for a WoW Token on the Auction House

[4:39:12] peepoInvest: yooo Shroud you hyped for Ulduar? the last 4 years playing classic 8 hours a day and for this moment it's finally here!!
[4:39:16] DBozy: @McLarge you do after 1/9 :)
[4:39:17] NexxOneGaming: That token information is a little misleading
[4:39:30] KussTV: i had millions when those were like 20 or 30k instead of 176k, damn inflation
[4:39:30] McLarge: @DBozy No, you do not. I completed the campaign
[4:39:37] Superjail_Warden: omg wow inflation is crazy, tokens were like 25-30k last I played
[4:39:47] Oriminally: @bunkfart From collecting dragon glyphs

[4:40:35] NexxOneGaming: my point is that its not that easy to make 176k gold a month
[4:40:38] KATINKOMAN: @shroud when are you gonna stream Runescape BibleThump BibleThump
[4:40:38] TheNoMansLands: ''this token may not be redeemed or traded''
