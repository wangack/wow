[0:48:01] Gatoradeshame: @SalvDali during your guild's normal runs do you boon and unboon buffs at certain points mid raid? Or do you just unboon at start and keep buffs out entire time
[0:48:03] ekiprkl: so it would make sense that now they know
[0:48:10] loathe_exe: SoD p1 was a big dip BECAUSE it was "new" content, no one knew what to expect vs P2 people have an idea of how the game is especially since there's no end game content in sight, it's just a repeat of P1

[3:06:27] maximus210793: coming back to dmt spellcrit buff, does it increase crit chance of any spells like dynamite, holy water, sappers etc?
[3:08:03] maximus210793: ok thanks :)
[3:08:12] xznips: sappers resist all the time anyway
[3:08:46] maximus210793: can "Fire-toasted Bun" be farmed as easy as dark desire ?
[3:08:59] brock_games: gotta have more spell hit for that spell crit cap Kappa
[3:09:03] SaucekayTV: do you think classic would be more fun if whenever you entered a raid for the first time (each raid lockout) you would automatically get full WBs?
[3:10:57] xznips: AKSCHUALLY there is a spellcrit cap on bosses of 95%
[3:11:29] belemrys: I remember building a spell crit set, but that was before I knew the spell hit table and when I wanted to cheese and get the ignite on meters lol
[3:11:34] belemrys: I was such a cheeser
[3:11:42] belemrys: back in 2005
[3:11:59] haldaz: You actually enjoy the grabbing world buff meta? I actually really like WBs but it kinda throws me off it when I have to run off the dinner table to grab the daily Ony
[3:12:36] haldaz: Id definitely take an npc that sold filled chronoboons

[3:15:15] rogueclassic: I'm probably in the minority but the entire wbuff griefing and wpvp around it was super fun. wish people rolled pve instead of pvp so they didnt fuck it all up with the boon

[3:16:46] maximus210793: you think adding chronoboon was good change ?
[3:16:51] haldaz: I really like the WB, stuff, its amazing grabbing them to go do open world farming or whatever, for me its really just that if you cant make it to the daily buff pop (from my HC perspective where its still announced on a discord) I end up just booning them till next raid or whatever and not actually using them
