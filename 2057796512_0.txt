[0:27:00] Atomicpanda: putting a frame around my giant 90s crt
[0:27:12] thunduz: let’s ignore everything the tv provides on the inside and just focus on the frame lol
[0:27:13] holyzeke: Talie your king has cancer are you worried?
[0:27:20] Dipichipii: tyty

[0:28:43] DozlaT: Are we talking leech therapy?
[0:28:45] Atomicpanda: only the strongest potions
[0:28:56] adam3comp: I ain't watched the crown even though it has ultimate GigaDaddy Matt Smith in it
[0:28:59] cabeshpash: yeah same, it gave me empathy for them, even though they are probably much worse IRL lol
[0:29:41] Garysteel1984: tax payer's money
[0:29:48] zeckzeckzeck: I don't know, I kind of want him to go the Breaking Bad route and start cooking meth in Buckingham Palace
[0:29:57] holyzeke: do you believe harry is his child?
[0:30:06] mxfelwinter: he dying of cancer isn't going to be subvert the monarchy anyway
[0:30:16] TankenFunk: I don't wish cancer upon anyone, I hope he recovers quickly cause watching that stuff tear someone apart is legitimately awful

[0:30:17] kso128: good point, GBN is actively hurting people
[0:30:18] witchhobbit: what did Evi start playing on the ps5?
[0:30:22] databob1: No they can do both
[0:30:28] adam3comp: our Royal Family is basically the scarlet crusade
[0:30:32] Nulgar: At least he's one of the people you should be least concerned about, millions of people with cancer have it worse
[0:30:59] restokin: what was the last game you played on your arcade machine?
[0:31:04] cynicles: chucky is probably gunna kick the can before i see his face replace his mummies on the coin
[0:31:07] thunduz: dude Evi has made some incredible choices in her gaming career
[0:31:16] Atomicpanda: crazy that it seems the UK is out transphobia-ing us in the US.
[0:31:21] fortmax98: @TaliesinAndEvitel Have you discussed the news of Denauser leaving Blizzard yet?
[0:31:21] futureforgotten: amazing games
[0:31:22] Triskelian: I have to say, I've been enjoying the "Diana gloating in the afterlife" memes
[0:31:24] HazMatt_Prime: Have you ever walked in on Evi crying from playing ff14?
[0:31:28] abomlol: Does WoW need a Republic? Priqme Minister Thrall

[0:31:45] thunduz: she should get FF7 crises core and intergrade
[0:31:46] TVNems: This may seem a random question but do you ever experience jealousy in your relationship ? You and evi very openely express your attraction to other people and seem to be unfeatherd by any jealousy
[0:31:50] Osirisson: I need to finish Alan Wake 2. It's so good but I got too sucked into Age of Wonders 4 lately.

[0:34:29] aeson_of_raid_sock: but why ?
[0:34:32] LGashly: WHAT THE FUCK?????
[0:34:43] jandemain: @Garysteel1984 actually i did but one bad fight isnt enough to ruin a raid
[0:34:47] DozlaT: that sucks
[0:34:48] Teth33: Tali has hinted for a while, but couldn't say anything.
[0:34:48] LGashly: :(
[0:34:52] gryffiest: so they pushed him out then?

[0:35:32] thunduz: He always seemed enthused to talk about WoW
[0:35:39] neverbornlucky: pray for me I had to put in for american Disability SSI again. Imagine having a Blood immunity disease in the age of covid being Denied for disability

[0:35:42] Nulgar: @netonkent Afrasiabi did that
[0:35:45] zeckzeckzeck: did afrasiabi burn it?
[0:35:46] blumberquack: @netonkent That was Afrasiabi wasn't it?
[0:35:52] netonkent: I know that was a joke
[0:35:54] netonkent: Hahs
[0:35:56] funviking99: he also said game of thrones season 8 was great so not good
[0:36:09] Nulgar: People are already attributing the good story parts of DF to Metzen clodagFacepalm
[0:36:09] Teth33: Danuser is the only reason SL got better at the end.
[0:36:16] DozlaT: ok so let's put him on a spike for liking got
[0:36:29] zeckzeckzeck: I heard he likes Nickelback

[0:37:33] GoldSmog: GoldSmog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[0:37:35] Vaephera: That GOT comment people keep bringing up was an instant reaction to one episode like halfway through the season, it wasn't meant to be a full critique of the whole season
[0:37:36] skewlbeta: He was responsible for Zerith Mortis and SL surprisingly sticking the landing, wasn't he?
[0:37:39] DrGreatScott: Potentially having bad taste isn't a reflection of the quality of your own craft.
[0:37:43] TVNems: Speaking like hes died lol
[0:37:44] neverbornlucky: Taliesin why is american disability system so Dog crap ?
[0:37:53] Atomicpanda: sounds like someone who really cared about what he was doing. so of course he got let go.
[0:38:11] Triskelian: @neverbornlucky Because it's the US -_-
[0:38:21] JarJar_Brinkz: Was he fired or did he leave
[0:38:21] LGashly: tali got that thicc integrity
[0:38:33] Teth33: The date on Linkedin says November 2023
[0:38:44] blumberquack: @JarJar_Brinkz Unsure, seems like he left
[0:38:47] netonkent: Could anyone take up Chris shoes, no matter how good people won't accept it
[0:38:52] LGashly: is Chris Metzen the new head writer then?
[0:38:57] Nulgar: @teth33 maybe just the start of the new job?
[0:39:01] Triskelian: Was Danuser let go because Metzen came back?
[0:39:20] zeckzeckzeck: It was probably a part of it
[0:39:34] Vaephera: I've also seen people blame Danuser for the "family" cutscene, which was after they think he got fired
[0:39:40] Rico_Azzarash: p.s. we did kill the council myth yesterday
[0:39:46] Nulgar: @triskelian maybe they got Metzen back because Danuser wanted to leave
[0:39:53] LGashly: Tali, why is "we are just innocent men" in the stream tags? XD
[0:40:00] Triskelian: @rico_azzarash GRATS!!!!!
[0:40:03] grimblymcgoo: @Nulgar I doubt he wanted to leave, but what the hell do i know
[0:40:22] DrGreatScott: As long as Terran keeps utilizing his signature "The Turn" in cinematics, I'm cool with whatever he and Metzen come up with
[0:40:25] Osirisson: IF the FTC doesn't fine Microsoft into the ground for perjury. Not sure if you saw the latest drama ms vs ftc.
[0:40:26] Teth33: I'm hoping he goes to work with Greg Street and those folks at their new project.
[0:40:28] DozlaT: Was it ion that was saying he Steve and metzen brainstormed the story?
[0:40:47] Nulgar: @grimblymcgoo well considering it was this long ago already, I doubt it has anything to do with the layoffs
[0:40:55] DozlaT: Oh
[0:40:55] zeckzeckzeck: who is akalon (sp?)?
[0:40:58] JarJar_Brinkz: We need those receipts
[0:40:58] TankenFunk: Love to see it
[0:41:00] aeson_of_raid_sock: why would you watch an Accolon video?
[0:41:01] LGashly: KEKW
[0:41:03] thunduz: well that videos gone I’m sure lol
[0:41:04] neverbornlucky: Taliesin   People in the USA still think disney Turning Red is about a girls period
[0:41:05] Tokryva: oh no... are we going down this rabbit hole again? LUL
[0:41:13] Nimsh: lucky escape for the tramp
[0:41:14] Nulgar: @zeckzeckzeck accolon, but don't check him out
[0:41:26] Triskelian: @zeckzeckzeck Accolon is another WoW YouTuber
[0:41:35] LGashly: oh come on mods let that message through XD
[0:41:35] ArkyteCurse: looks like the time has come for accolon to pay the piper... or at least play with the pipe
[0:41:37] the_howlermonkey: I personally hope he told them to fuck off and left.. but I am sure he was canned. I feel like the old EQ guys are probably treated like crap in that office.
[0:41:42] VimFuego1970: doesn’t want to meet that Tramp them?
[0:41:46] Nulgar: @TaliesinEvitel do you know whether Steve left or was fired?
[0:41:54] neverbornlucky: Taliesin how does it feel to be Diablo4 you have no wow PTR for patches
[0:41:54] erdls: I sawr it

[0:42:24] LGashly: OH BOYO
[0:42:32] DozlaT: Huh
[0:42:33] cynicles: oh god its this guy
[0:42:47] Hixx90: @Rico_Azzarash Thanks mate
[0:42:48] chico_escuela: hello everyone!

[0:42:51] the_howlermonkey: and i bet that carried over to the blizz guys being in charge at blizz and those hard feelings carried over
[0:42:53] Rico_Azzarash: Oh wait I figured it out xD
[0:42:53] Triskelian: Oh, Accolon Is THIS dickhead
[0:42:57] cynicles: i bet this dude here knows how normal humans live
[0:42:57] neverbornlucky: This guy must be a Donald Trump  supporter
[0:43:02] kikisume: wtf?? lol
[0:43:03] JarJar_Brinkz: Tali streams are the only reason I even know this guy exists
[0:43:06] DozlaT: Phew
[0:43:08] GoldSmog: yeah, game is full of normal ppl
[0:43:09] ArkyteCurse: you have to understand normal people to write rotting undead corpses
[0:43:16] cynicles: guys like this always set themselves up
[0:43:18] zeckzeckzeck: California has more people than my entire country, but sure they're all "weird"
[0:43:22] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you are weird like Cali
[0:43:23] LGashly: you don't have too, he speaks for himself and . . . yea XD
[0:43:24] bucephalos: This world is a prison
[0:43:24] Teth33: Acco used to be in this chat every stream until Tali told him what to do and where to put it.
[0:43:26] blumberquack: Mfw the fantasy species aren't acting like actual human beings LUL
[0:43:35] Bambiprsi: you can speed up the video on YT easily by clicking and holding the left mouse button in the frame
[0:44:01] Dazzaw17: who is this dude? the only wow youtubers i watch at tali, bel, hazel and kelani
[0:44:08] Dazzaw17: *are
[0:44:32] thunduz: was it bad?
[0:44:34] Nulgar: It'd be better if more people weren't as outgoing, especially him
[0:44:37] LGashly: that poor fucking tramp
[0:44:41] holyzeke: where is he from?
[0:44:43] Osirisson: Who is this dude? Rush Limbaugh wanna be?
[0:44:47] DozlaT: he started as a wow loretuber iirc @dazzaw17
[0:44:48] Rico_Azzarash: oh no.... Not the show don't tell guy again
[0:45:14] LGashly: OH GOD HE'S THE "SHOW DON'T TELL" GUY XD
[0:45:16] zeckzeckzeck: forcing us to listen to this feels like abuse
[0:45:17] thunduz: I just heard bad about 50 thousand times so I was curious
[0:45:21] JarJar_Brinkz: @Rico_Azzarash Oh, trade/general chat? Kappa
[0:45:21] SherubiIzumi: they really want you to comment lolz
[0:45:23] cynicles: when was anything ever sold by blizzard as a danuser story?
[0:45:25] the_howlermonkey: id imagine this dude also doenst know what stories Steve wrote
[0:45:26] Renixia1: comment on it you know you want too ;)
[0:45:40] maplelost: HOLY SHIT DANUSER IS GONE WOW IS SAVED
[0:45:44] Tokryva: I just tried to press the notification bell to get rid of the notification, but it's on Tali's YouTube seenCry
[0:45:50] thunduz: truth
[0:45:57] LGashly: XD
[0:45:57] aeson_of_raid_sock: hey now
[0:45:58] Harper_n7: oi fuck you bruv
[0:46:00] phritss: Watch it bub! lol
[0:46:00] the_howlermonkey: PLEASE stop subjecting us to this hamroll
[0:46:01] Sharxkin: Racist!
[0:46:02] SherubiIzumi: ouch
[0:46:03] LGashly: LOL
[0:46:05] Sharxkin: =P
[0:46:07] futureforgotten: as an american can confirm we are weird
[0:46:07] Triskelian: Wow. Thanks a LOT Tali -_-
[0:46:08] databob1: To bad you can't songify him
[0:46:10] Osirisson: We are weird. I take that as a compliment. THANKS!
[0:46:11] DozlaT: no comment
[0:46:12] atamala: califnoria? you mean commie-fornia
[0:46:15] LGashly: I mean, hey, you married one XD
[0:46:15] Arlaeya: we're weird... and from NYC.. calfornians are weird.. especially about bagels
[0:46:25] LGashly: you help birth one XD
[0:46:26] Teth33: It's just baffling that a lizard wearing human skin like Acco is saying that Californians are not normal.
[0:46:34] cynicles: the nastiest american i ever had to deal with were midwesterners with money who almost never get hate
[0:46:46] TVNems: Maybe it was a dream you had
[0:46:55] markaud23: holy shit this guy...
[0:46:59] aeson_of_raid_sock: the only thing weird about California is their love of in n out
[0:47:01] mxfelwinter: as a mexican, the americans from california are the most normal ones imo
[0:47:03] thunduz: tneEvi
[0:47:06] TankenFunk: Can you ctrl+f and search for it within the transcript @TaliesinAndEvitel ?
[0:47:19] neverbornlucky: Taliesin did you hear in the USA that the breaking news is Joe Biden is a old man
[0:47:20] LGashly: tali you said you wouldn't do it XD
[0:47:24] LGashly: resist!!
[0:47:33] blumberquack: Fyrakk losing himself? Iri not giving a shit about either of them? LUL
[0:47:42] lumaday: lol
[0:47:43] Triskelian: I thought you weren't going to comment on the video Tali... :D
[0:47:43] TankenFunk: I think it's wild how Anakin was just a little kid and then all of a sudden he's Darth Vader? I don't get it
[0:47:50] netonkent: 2, the dragon torture and the keeper torture
[0:47:54] kikisume: :P
[0:47:58] krisz49: :P
[0:48:18] Tokryva: 4*
[0:48:19] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I hate that its not a joke but the american media is really shocked that Joe Biden is old
[0:48:21] bucephalos: 4?
[0:48:28] databob1: California is beautiful but I don't like alot of thier policies
[0:48:34] Tokryva: but it is 4
[0:48:35] DrGreatScott: Calling it a redemption arc is also just categorically wrong. Her motives have always been just
[0:48:35] SherubiIzumi: chaotic evil
[0:48:37] futureforgotten: Theres 4 though
[0:48:39] Tokryva: Razageth
[0:48:47] Vaephera: Doing my gal Razageth dirty :(
[0:48:58] futureforgotten: JUSTICE FOR RAZAGETH
[0:49:33] blumberquack: Bet Rasz's visage form is rad, shame we never got to see it
[0:49:50] lumaday: @blumberquack a real tragedy
[0:49:54] aeson_of_raid_sock: dragon nazi
[0:49:55] databob1: I miss the penguin queen
[0:50:18] phritss: What is a "pure" dragon? a Proto?
[0:50:35] Nulgar: "dragons should be pure" - *imbues himself with Earth magic*
[0:50:41] LGashly: he hates them for their nature and their systems that they've build.
[0:50:57] LGashly: god i need to open up wow again fuck
[0:51:28] databob1: She's like a trickster she's there to make us question the status quo
[0:51:32] Triskelian: @lgashly You should. DF is so good
[0:51:33] dragonswing0: they took her eggs and changed them
[0:51:36] tempestmellinger1901: HeyGuys
[0:52:02] Harper_n7: Is Iridikron dead? I must have missed what happened to him in my absence..
[0:52:06] LGashly: @Triskelian oh i know, i just haven't played . . . any of the last patch, haven't really played since blizcon because my life has been a struggle XD, i will pick it back up hopefully this month :)
[0:52:14] dragonswing0: they took them without her choice
[0:52:22] Arlaeya: It's very personal
[0:52:23] lumaday: i feel like thats pretty clear as well
[0:52:30] Alonarius: It's why Vyranoth was most prone to changing sides, because Alex claimed responsibility and apologised
[0:52:51] DrGreatScott: Her motives are justified on top of it all. Him calling it a redemption arc just feels weird and just plain wrong
[0:52:54] blumberquack: That and she's still not okay with the titans LUL
[0:53:00] Triskelian: @lgashly I understand about struggle. Take the time you need for yourself and come back when ready VirtualHug VirtualHug VirtualHug
[0:53:06] phritss: Her's is emotional. His is ideological .
[0:53:10] Discordant_Hats: Yeah she was crushing hard on Alexstrasza and then Alex did, in her eyes, the equivalent of handing out church-leaflets.
[0:53:31] LGashly: her anger was coming from a place that was much more open to healing, because her hate was with people instead of a monolithic force and system of their power like her brother's was
[0:53:41] LGashly: @Triskelian <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:53:50] azurw: could iridikon's hatred be amplified cuz hes working with the void though
[0:54:04] LGashly: :3
[0:54:15] atamala: that's a byproduct of his hatred in my opinion
[0:54:15] LGashly: i finally said something that wasn't dumb! :D
[0:54:17] DrGreatScott: Her joining the aspects feels akin to changing the system from within
[0:54:56] DrGreatScott: Played the infinites like a damn fiddle
[0:55:28] Reminii91: hey it's... that guy... I wonder how is the game he was "making" as I was watching Bellular announced his gam
[0:55:43] TVNems: Tali you gotta stop spoiling the games plot before Blizz have even written it
[0:55:58] Alonarius: "He can't keep getting away with this!" Welly say
[0:56:02] Alonarius: We'll*
[0:56:03] DrGreatScott: Definitely not a one note villain. Best think that came from DF
[0:56:04] skewlbeta: Sounds hot
[0:56:07] netonkent: Do you think they changed anything after Steve been sacked or too late for that?
[0:56:14] Deatheran: idk i feel like in my mind the "void" should be the ultimate evil in wow. mainly cause im a sucker for eldritch stuff.
[0:56:17] LGashly: what if illidan shows up AS A TITAN!?!?!?! @.@
[0:56:17] Nulgar: It's a catch-22, Iridikron will win either way
[0:56:19] LGashly: kidding
[0:56:20] azurw: if not all teh titans atleast 1
[0:56:26] futureforgotten: he would kill the titans in midnight? I thought we saw them in the 3rd xpac
[0:56:31] Discordant_Hats: On the point of 'Iridikron VS The Jailer.' I do think that Idirikron jumping between villainous allies is an underrated reason he's fun, the 4d chess is *actually playing out in front of us.*
[0:56:38] Nontus135: So who's the last Titan?
[0:56:51] futureforgotten: fair!!
[0:56:53] databob1: Can we keep tier
[0:56:58] Lerker3: All the Titans everywhere all at once
[0:57:04] futureforgotten: you got me there
[0:57:05] skewlbeta: On the tin lol
[0:57:06] TankenFunk: But what about The Last Jedi? That turned out not to be true either Kappa
[0:57:08] phyra: i assumed azeroth was the last titan
[0:57:10] DrGreatScott: @Discordant_Hats Good point! 4D chess is fun when showcased properly
[0:57:11] Alonarius: *Metzen voice* World of Warcraft: All of the Titans
[0:57:19] jmalmin: isnt the Titans all locked up with Ilidan keeping Sargaras trapped?
[0:57:22] LGashly: @Nontus135 Probably Azeroth
[0:57:31] Alonarius: It still sounds good imagining it in metzens voice
[0:57:31] TVNems: It could also refer to another titan we havent met yet like the new titan in Hearthstone
[0:57:34] Nulgar: @futureforgotten it was said we would find out about a "conspiracy" of the Titans - they don't need to be still alive for that to be unveiled
[0:57:37] Deatheran: ??? HUHH what is he saying
[0:57:38] the_howlermonkey: i bet this booger posts on the wow forums. lol
[0:57:45] Sch1ey: Wait wut sch1eyBlink
[0:57:48] jandemain: the jailer is the last titan
[0:57:53] LGashly: @Nulgar in fact, probably easier to uncover their conspiracy if they're dead
[0:57:55] TankenFunk: Damn, talking about Trump and reps, really bringing politics into gaming smh my head
[0:57:56] futureforgotten: this dude just went from dragon aspects to TRUMP
[0:57:57] squarepusher_: *talks politics in a wow lore video* "You shouldn't be preaching to people blah blah blah"
[0:57:57] blumberquack: pOlItIcAl
[0:57:57] azurw: well this is a hot take if i ever herd one
[0:58:09] azurw: hes puttign him own views into a wow story
[0:58:12] futureforgotten: @Nulgar @LGashly good point
[0:58:14] databob1: BS
[0:58:18] nzreaper: bro, you said you didnt wanna comment :p :D
[0:58:21] atamala: what a weird take and i dont think this guy should be in the kitchen at all
[0:58:24] HazMatt_Prime: I was debating a friend about the Titans and Dragons. She was like "Titans suck, they used mind controlling water" and I was thinking "Yeah, they were a bunch of savage and dumb reptiles and they gave them a job". I almost thought of it as how humans turned wolves into dogs...except they became sapient. Am I wrong in my comparison? I'm fine with you calling me a dumbass, but I'm curious if you get my point of view.
[0:58:26] netonkent: The trump thing is One of the worst takes I've ever heard
[0:58:30] LGashly: XD
[0:58:36] Teth33: He doesn't read quest text.
[0:58:36] northshanks: Frump worshippers can't help themselves. They're so desperate for attention to remain on him that they will bring him up even in games.
[0:58:41] databob1: That story was great
[0:58:43] azurw: hes a quest skipper
[0:58:49] skeletonetiquette: World of Warcraft: Buncha Fekkin Titans
[0:58:53] squarepusher_: @northshanks nice bro, we get it.
[0:58:55] Nulgar: We already have talks with the Sundered Flame during the 10.1 campaign
[0:58:57] Vaephera: The amount of people I still see complaining about wrathion/ebyssian in 10.1 that don't seem to realise the old god shenanigans that were going on is wild
[0:59:08] thunduz: I have enjoyed dragonflight and its story
[0:59:10] avatos_94: why do people like this just automatically call everything they personally don’t like political wether it is or not 🤦🏻‍♂️
[0:59:12] northshanks: @squarepusher_ Do you, though?
[0:59:17] Sch1ey: How dare you assume he could read the quests
[0:59:19] DrGreatScott: Literally had Sark's 2nd in command step in and say "No, wait we fucked up". It made perfect narrative sense
[0:59:30] khalcrux_gaming: Forgive me? First of all they attacked me. I'm the victim here.
[0:59:34] squarepusher_: @northshanks yeah man, you spelled it out clearly.
[0:59:35] thunduz: I personally never thought they were political stories but ok
[0:59:35] blumberquack: What LUL
[0:59:40] Lerker3: I think that WoW has a similar issue as a few other "game-first" games with stories. I see it a lot in Magic the Gathering as well. A lot of people just get the very broad view, and only if you dig deeper and read the quests (or in MTG the stories), you get a VERY different read of the story as a whole.
[0:59:42] Nontus135: ????
[0:59:42] BumbleMoonHive: BumbleMoonHive subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:59:42] reece_101_: huh?
[0:59:42] avatos_94: ….what
[0:59:43] knightjudicator: what the fuck did i walk into
[0:59:44] futureforgotten: "im not political, but TRUMP"
[0:59:45] unleashyourbless: what on earth
[0:59:47] avatos_94: what?
[0:59:49] azurw: hes throwing alot of hottake words into this to try and trigger people
[0:59:51] cynicles: ?!?wuht?!?!
[0:59:52] kikisume: tneKhadgarWut tneKhadgarWut tneKhadgarWut
[0:59:52] avatos_94: the hell?
[0:59:53] AltGrW: I just got here and have NO IDEA what he is talking about
[0:59:53] Sch1ey: Self report?
[0:59:58] PinkSharkie: huh???
[0:59:58] avatos_94: is he okay
[1:00:02] emylinn: say what now?
[1:00:05] databob1: Forgiveness Isa political point.?? I'm afraid
[1:00:09] Harper_n7: "Not very political" *Is literally assigning a relation to a fantasy world to real world comparison of... politics...
[1:00:10] skewlbeta: mrgmAlright
[1:00:11] PinkSharkie: what is he talking about right now
[1:00:13] blumberquack: ...guys I think he's projecting? LUL
[1:00:15] avatos_94: the psychology books that could be written about him
[1:00:15] CasualR: Ah yes, "I'm not very political" = "I don't like it when games constantly mock my particular politics"
[1:00:18] Nulgar: @altgrw we've been here a while, and same
[1:00:20] Nontus135: Is he American? Do people in other countries identify as Republicans?
[1:00:34] CasualR: Oh God
[1:00:35] cynicles: lmfao!!!!
[1:00:39] azurw: he is one of them people
[1:00:40] cynicles: this guy!!!
[1:00:41] blumberquack: b r u h
[1:00:42] khalcrux_gaming: Oh no
[1:00:44] jmalmin: How did he land on democrats vs republicans in a game... I give up.
[1:00:47] Osirisson: who the fuck is this guy?
[1:00:52] cynicles: what a spot to land on
[1:00:53] Teth33: He knows what to say to pander to the type of people who watch his videos.
[1:01:01] LGashly: Tali why is "we're just innocent men" in the stream tags? XD
[1:01:02] knightjudicator: @Teth33 this
[1:01:04] Osirisson: Tell him I hate him
[1:01:07] phyra: couchb10Eyes
[1:01:08] avatos_94: he’s really checking all the marks of douchebaggery he can wow
[1:01:11] blumberquack: I like my gobbos but I'm glad they moved away from 'har har money' tbh
[1:01:17] blumberquack: engineering is way more interesting for goblins
[1:01:19] GingerBear30: Everyone's entitled to their wrong opinions :D
[1:01:22] mydemoncat: The Draenei are space jews!
[1:01:22] atamala: tauren, goblins, pandaren are all guilty of this
[1:01:24] azurw: hes just throwing a ton of hot take words into this video
[1:01:25] Rajven: Everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not their own facts.
[1:01:35] khalcrux_gaming: Yeah he doesn't know the history of Goblins being used that way so he's implying it's us associating them with jews
[1:01:45] BIuffwatcher: I thought Goblins were from the Bronx :P
[1:01:48] Teth33: @Osirisson He is probably in this chat undercover, so he knows.
[1:02:02] Lerker3: But goblins are clearly based on New Jersey! /s
[1:02:06] futureforgotten: @TaliesinAndEvitel well said
[1:02:17] DrGreatScott: Mic drop Tali
[1:02:23] TankenFunk: @LGashly Look up the user @wejustnormalmen on twitter. It's a clip from a british tv show tali has referenced a decent amount on stream
[1:02:25] azurw: this is the type of guy that would be scared of boobs
[1:02:43] mxfelwinter: tali, i think you are attribuiting iridrikron as the mastermind of using the infinite as bait instead of xalathat
[1:02:49] DozlaT: Isn't he from SA
[1:02:49] databob1: That's fair tali
[1:02:53] CasualR: ...
[1:02:54] LGashly: @TankenFunk oh I know XD just wild that its in the tags, tali sure do love that meme :P
[1:02:57] westvo: guys pretending to be colorblind
[1:02:58] hitchmeister59: Tali, quit trying to put nuance on the internet. This is not the place for that.
[1:03:02] kikisume: rough
[1:03:03] khalcrux_gaming: I don't see color lol. Not sure I believe him
[1:03:06] Shanhayde: very dishonest :/
[1:03:09] Discordant_Hats: "They don't exist in the real world, they're made up" and where was it, that they were made-up my man, was it made up...within the context...of the real world
[1:03:12] TankenFunk: @LGashly Ah I see tneEvi
[1:03:12] Sch1ey: Trolls are Norwegian daa
[1:03:26] phyra: not very political BTW
[1:03:36] atamala: tauren and the sioux or paiute or zandalari and central americans etc
[1:03:37] Nulgar: Imagine just broadcasting on full volume that you cannot see simple analogies
[1:03:41] ArkyteCurse: The absolute neck-breaking speed in which he went from "this story is an attack on republicans and is political" to "this stuff isn't real so why would I attribute it to the real world"
[1:03:44] Lerker3: WC2 Amani trolls also used really weird cuban stereotypical accent
[1:03:50] nzreaper: @Sch1ey lmao, ikr!
[1:03:51] thunduz: correct
[1:03:52] aeson_of_raid_sock: is he making the if you see the racism you’re the racist argument?
[1:03:55] Tokryva: it almost sounds like Acco loves to keep his WoW lore in a closed reading environment, and very much dislikes people who interpret it in an open reading environment with influences from the 'real
[1:03:58] Tokryva: '  world
[1:03:58] SancerTheDeathKnight: yeet
[1:04:06] TankenFunk: @aeson_of_raid_sock yes, sadly
[1:04:20] Sch1ey: Not political tho
[1:04:36] DrGreatScott: The whole "Fantasy isn't based on anything and nothing from reality has EVER been in fiction. Especially not stereotypes" is the most willfully ignorant takes I continue to hear and it's insane
[1:04:40] jmalmin: Tell Acco that he is wrong... Oh boy you will release the devil in him if you do.
[1:04:46] khalcrux_gaming: But Tali but Tali. I don't see color so it must be you who's racist cause I'm colorblind. /s
[1:04:48] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel literaly every culture we create in a fantasy setting has SOME basis in a real culture. some have more obvious links than others. he does not seem to see that i guess
[1:04:54] s7wede: you must remember that he is South African and has a great distrust of anything governmental. Race is also a very touchy subject there
[1:04:59] skewlbeta: this is very pipeline-y
[1:05:01] CasualR: What a great sub image btw
[1:05:02] Nulgar: He's likely just not seeing these stereotypes as stereotypes
[1:05:13] CasualR: Ugh
[1:05:15] Sch1ey: Im ready for him to defend lolicons with 'its not real'
[1:05:22] Lerker3: They appreciate it when it's done respectfully... <.<
[1:05:35] atamala: imagine missing the point entirely lol
[1:05:53] futureforgotten: @TaliesinAndEvitel wishful thinking
[1:06:02] aeson_of_raid_sock: is this a South African white mans opinion on race?
[1:06:30] placeholdername33: copy / paste the transcript into notepad and search that way
[1:06:32] futureforgotten: Check comments for the youtube video?
[1:06:41] Saevash: @taliesinandevitel Wanna know something funny? In the italian dub of WoW the trolls have a Neapolitan accent. Which is also kinda crazy. No harm done but with the history of our country it kinda is a bit on the nose
[1:06:52] thunduz: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[1:07:03] azurw: wait wahts this about chooseing a BG3 tattoo
[1:07:11] thunduz: it is what the heart wanted to hear
[1:07:16] DrGreatScott: "Ah yes, I enjoy seeing people as a caricatures for laughs because it's never bad ever" JFC this guys rants nonsense
[1:07:17] Deatheran: yea the south african man not feeling oppressed when a coimic used an africana hat, calling it his culture and not understanding cultural apropriation is very on brand
[1:07:24] AlfredK: What is happening?
[1:07:41] Mazerbeam: ctrl+A
[1:07:42] aeson_of_raid_sock: you made us watch the wrong video lol
[1:07:43] Lerker3: ctrl + A = seelct all
[1:07:45] squarepusher_: ctrl + A to select all
[1:07:49] Durwen: why you subject yourself to that nonsense is way beyond me, man
[1:07:55] Nulgar: Did it copy the entire transcript or does YT do some shit with unloading parts?
[1:07:59] john_fury_: No as a white South African man I feel that everyone’s opinion tends to differ
[1:08:01] TVNems: The quote you are looking for is in another castle
[1:08:03] blumberquack: @DrGreatScott Tbh I think it's more him saying "It doesn't offend me so clearly it shouldn't offend anyone else"
[1:08:13] azurw: he cencored his own video?
[1:08:14] LGashly: aren't transcripts auto generated? might be missed
[1:08:15] khalcrux_gaming: You know somebody clipped it
[1:08:23] DrGreatScott: @blumberquack Exactly that
[1:08:24] Durwen: look for the Danuser segment
[1:08:25] holyzeke: you must of dreamed this one Talie
[1:08:25] Fuskersong: try searching for fired and look around near that
[1:08:26] cosmopanda13: maybe it was a different video?
[1:08:27] Sharxkin: probably got demonetized for vulgar language so he took it out
[1:08:29] Nilpointnil: heard it with thine own eyes
[1:08:31] kanatran: Why are we watching g this? Lack of content?
[1:08:32] Sch1ey: Censorship at the worst.
[1:08:34] Efendal: i also hear things with my eyes
[1:08:35] LGashly: fired
[1:08:43] LGashly: you should look for fired
[1:08:43] futureforgotten: possibly another video?
[1:08:52] LGashly: the transcript wont have that XD
[1:08:53] chryseis: What did he say?
[1:09:04] Lerker3: it probably is because the auto-generated transcript doesn't know how to spell the name @TaliesinAndEvitel
[1:09:04] robotmansa: The transcript is autogenerated and it's "Dener"
[1:09:04] atamala: try a simple word like "is" to see if that finds it
[1:09:06] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel his accent?
[1:09:11] LilyOfTremere: It was worded as "never" at some point at least
[1:09:13] mxfelwinter: maybe it is the wrong video?
[1:09:13] DrGreatScott: If it's an auto transcript, then the name might be mispelled
[1:09:13] thunduz: tneEvi  I got checked by the mod
[1:09:15] Deatheran: on screen its Steve dener
[1:09:17] OILTIME: Hope yet remains
[1:09:19] elderratt: video name?
[1:09:21] Vaephera: I can see it transcribed as "newer" and "dener" on that page
[1:09:22] netonkent: Of all the things to not to record Tali,  in pudding for you tonight haha
[1:09:26] Fuskersong: try fired
[1:09:29] LGashly: @TaliesinAndEvitel the transcripts are auto generated so a lot of works are misinterpreted
[1:09:32] Sch1ey: The ai cant understand his accent
[1:09:35] Mazerbeam: This is why I use Google Docs /s
[1:09:37] mydemoncat: what month did the video come out
[1:09:41] jmalmin: try clicking at the top of the just before the transcript start. you might be searching at the end of the script.
[1:09:48] TankenFunk: This truly is one of the WoW streams of all time tneEvi
[1:09:51] kanatran: Is it true that Steve Danusser was sent to Rock & Roll Racing or Lost Vikings to keep him away from WOW ????
[1:09:51] LilyOfTremere: Look for "never"
[1:09:53] lucor23: maybe try steve
[1:09:57] BW_saty: it was all a dream golemLUL
[1:10:21] draxius34: Doing it by page, rather than all?
[1:10:25] Lerker3: click find again
[1:10:28] jmalmin: hit find over and over again
[1:10:38] Deatheran: Steve Tuser LUL
[1:10:42] netonkent: Hobbo?
[1:10:50] Mazerbeam: You have the worst word processor
[1:10:53] TVNems: Put it in google docs instead
[1:10:56] LGashly: XD
[1:10:56] Lerker3: What is the actual phrase you're looking for? / what did it sound like
[1:11:09] azurw: what has this stream becomne
[1:11:19] Derployd: What have I walked in on?
[1:11:21] Lerker3: what did he say!?
[1:11:34] Nontus135: we watched a crazy person for nothing! tneTaliCry
[1:11:40] stewart1957: Is it only giving the chapter heading not the full transcript
[1:11:56] cosmopanda13: Did you see the twitter thread from the lead vfx artist of overwatch btw?
[1:11:57] thunduz: I am hyped for sonic 3
[1:12:02] s7wede: Basically since Metzens return
[1:12:13] holyzeke: has anyone left been there since day 1?
[1:12:25] thunduz: Icy Veins is saying danuser left around november
[1:12:27] Deatheran: i dont know a THING about this steve fellow. not followed it.
[1:12:47] DrGreatScott: In the "Alan Wake" of Metzen's return ;P
[1:12:50] thunduz: oh I follow
[1:12:59] Derployd: I lot of people are basing his departure date based on Steve's linkdin
[1:13:01] thunduz: takes this old man brain to catch up
[1:13:03] Mazerbeam: You want us to believe you over someone with literal ice in their veins?!
[1:13:05] Teth33: He probably wasn't allowed to say anything until after Blizzcon as part of his severance agreement.
[1:13:05] Vaephera: He probably had several months gardening leave or something. Still technically employed til november, but paid to sit at home with no access
[1:13:11] s7wede: Maybe there was friction and it was a sort of constructive dismissal
[1:13:12] LarryDean: LarryDean subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:13:17] adnan2: i expect its just that the paperwork was done and he was officially no longer part of Blizz as of Nov
[1:13:18] Discordant_Hats: Perhaps 'Danuser' was never even there. tneNzothEye
[1:13:20] DozlaT: I hope he goes on to do something super well and wow ppl have to eat crow about it
[1:13:29] AlfredK: I wonder what Metzen genuinely think about what they have done to the story while he has been gone
[1:13:33] aerohokie: aerohokie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[1:13:34] BigTimeLag: BigTimeLag subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:13:51] Nontus135: Like by other Devs?
[1:13:52] Nexusshade: @TaliesinAndEvitel if I may ask. what do you think about this month trading post?
[1:13:55] gryffiest: how was he?
[1:13:55] thunduz: now the real goal is for T&E to get Metzen to sat tneTaliWasRight
[1:13:57] databob1: That sucks
[1:14:00] Nimsh: tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto
[1:14:01] Nontus135: Treated badly by other Devs?
[1:14:15] DrGreatScott: Did you see the thread about the employee who got a fake promotion?
[1:14:20] Vaephera: NOT made it all about Thrall is what they've done to the story
[1:14:21] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel ive heard several stories of blizz and thier HR being almost comicaly evil at this point
[1:14:29] s7wede: Metzen wasn't the best storyteller either. He was an amazing world builder and character planner, but the story was never strong
[1:14:29] AlfredK: I mean fans have been pretty vile sometimes too
[1:14:29] Animeinn: and community
[1:14:34] elderratt: name of the video please
[1:14:41] Teth33: In my opinion, all the major story points were in place before Metzen left the first time.
[1:14:43] Discordant_Hats: Regardless of his writing, the whole "Nathanos is a self insert on spurious evidence so we're going to harass the hell out of him" was a shit time to be in the WoW community.
[1:14:49] Mazerbeam: HR can suck a tramp
[1:14:51] skewlbeta: work in HR - no offense taken lol
[1:15:01] ramzie0: There was a thread on twitter about someone's terrible experience at blizz surrounding a promotion
[1:15:02] dotonbori: lol
[1:15:17] dotonbori: I'd never heard that before
[1:15:24] AlfredK: It is ok to think the story is bad but you cant attack him personally
[1:15:28] cosmopanda13: Check Chris Sayers tweet it's crazy how bad it is
[1:15:30] sebnificant: Even if someone's "as bad" as the "fans" say he is, they're still treating him terrible.
[1:15:32] azurw: wasnt that in a tweet
[1:15:34] the_howlermonkey: A lot of WOW devs were very loud and brash EQ players... The ex staff from EQ, of which Steve Danuser was one... Did not appreciate them. Jeff KAplan was expecially reviled inside SONYEQ studios. they hated him for the name and for his posts. I think there was probablhy aggro there between those ex eq ppl and the snr wow guys
[1:15:40] TankenFunk: No matter what you think of Danuser and his input on the story, the treatment he got by wow players was so weird and unnecessary
[1:15:51] DrGreatScott: Nathanos was a great character to hate. A bit of a waste to not showcase his regrets in game, but otherwise he was great as a foil to dislike
[1:15:56] Lerker3: As someone who played missed everything from MOP to BFA; what stories did Danuser do? I'm not really familiar
[1:16:08] khalcrux_gaming: Tali Think we will get a Vyranoth skin for season 4?
[1:16:21] Dagomarus: teldrassil deserved to be burnt, i could never mind anything lol
[1:16:23] azurw: yeah role play tweets
[1:16:35] Dagomarus: find*
[1:16:36] TankenFunk: "It's like looking into a Dark Mirror" for the updated Nathanos model. The way people use that to call him a self-insert is crazy
[1:16:42] allthatidontknow: personal attacks were unnecessary, he objectively is a terrible writer
[1:16:43] chronos789: people on reddit are still giving him shit for liking game of thrones season 8
[1:16:45] Gaming_Mama56: Nathanos was around before Danuser worked thete
[1:16:46] Animeinn: Fans will continue to be vile with whoever replaced Danuser.
[1:17:07] KatieRet_: cosy lighting!
[1:17:20] Enigmio: Good evening
[1:17:23] Vaephera: Can't believe danuser wrote nathanos as a self insert 11 years before he joined blizzard
[1:17:30] Brukhalian: What happened to Steve Danuser?  Wad he fired…?
[1:17:33] Discordant_Hats: There was a whole "Nathanos got a new body to be more like Danuser" theory that a ton of people believed! Like, guys! Nathanos stole his cousin's body! That's not exactly where you'd place a self insert.
[1:17:37] allthatidontknow: people didn't like him because he wrote nothing of substance, always with a pretentious "it'll all come together. you'll see" and it never did.
[1:17:39] witchhobbit: i thought people were saying that about Afrasiabi
[1:17:44] databob1: I loved to hate nathanos
[1:17:47] kanatran: Was Danusser sent to Rock & Roll Racing or Lost Vikings 🤣?
[1:17:54] AlfredK: lol
[1:18:01] DrGreatScott: Tali did you see last night's Chris Sayers tweets about his experience at Blizz? It's a brutal thread to read.
[1:18:07] Alonarius: Terran sounds like Teron as in Teron Gorefiend, clearly a self insert
[1:18:12] Engram08: I read somewhere since November?
[1:18:49] casualviewerxqt: that xmog is fucking sick
[1:18:58] the_howlermonkey: Stever DanUSER... the playerbase are all USERS of a client.. I cant believe he would insert himself into the product like that.
[1:19:08] spettetgaming: Putin controls the narrative. I heard
[1:19:20] TVNems: So many meetings happen before any story is decided. So either most people agreed on story decisions or someone has pulled their power over others which danuser never had the authority to do surely
[1:19:27] Mazerbeam: Side stories is what makes games like Fallout
[1:19:50] Dagomarus: the blue dragonflight story and the black one was really good
[1:19:54] Discordant_Hats: Putting the "world" in world of warcraft, shame if we lose that
[1:20:01] Dagomarus: the bronze and murozond could of been better
[1:20:23] spettetgaming: Like BG3. Sidestories made the game
[1:21:01] Dagomarus: even if the story is bad he could still hype us up for it
[1:21:38] Derployd: My concern is that the recent layoffs reduced the 'Lore Historian' departments shrunk from 12 to 2 people, and I understand that that department was really important for the story team
[1:21:40] TankenFunk: I will always be upset about how vile and awful the community were being to Danuser, no matter what you think about the story in the end. He was left one hell of a mess to clean up, and maybe someone else could've done a better job, but Danuser didn't do half the stuff people claim he did
[1:22:13] Rico_Azzarash: Im back, what did I miss
[1:22:30] Derployd: My understanding was that he wasn't even sharing the ideas he had clearly. He was possessive over 'his' story
[1:22:57] Dagomarus: i would of loved if sylvanus secretly planned to to betray the jailor from the beginning
[1:23:02] Jeanie130: Jeanie130 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:23:17] Discordant_Hats: Feels weird to get Metzen back, a guy whose big thing feels like big hero character moments, in the wake of a once fan-fav Sylvanas getting so screwed over as a character.
[1:23:38] Dagomarus: doing dailies endlessly in the maw is a fate worse than death ngl
[1:23:39] Enigmio: i would say, the outcome with sylvanas is ok right now, many options open
[1:23:50] RoboticUnicorn007: Now for Season of Discovery play .... haha
[1:23:50] AlfredK: Hard to say who's at fault since we weren't there. The only thing I can say for sure is that I haven't liked the story in years.
[1:23:52] Proxzo: The Sylvanas ending was received generally neutrally which is the best we could hope for.
[1:24:16] Beyondvalor: I was watching a streamer 100% Shadowlands recently and the Maw music came on...and I noped out of there lol
[1:24:16] Nulgar: I/we don't know any specifics, but in general, they should've just dropped that arc, say that Sylvanas was replaced by a Faceless One, still ending BfA with N'zoth
[1:24:22] casualviewerxqt: am I correct when I feel that DF narrative seemed a little bit childish?
[1:24:30] skewlbeta: I always thought shadowlands was a dumpster fire rolling down a hill that stuck the landing.
[1:24:37] awkswow: I wonder when/if they're going to bring her back
[1:24:46] Tokryva: I heard it similar from a stream last night from a former Blizzard employee (Devolore) where he said that Danuser basically had to serve the shit sandwich that Afrasiabi had provided, but he had to leave the shit in. And that the eventual ending was the least shit they couldve made with the way it was set up
[1:24:54] Nontus135: Probably could have killed her off at the end of BFA and then bring her back with some Shadowlands magic.
[1:25:03] Frosted2319: one of my friends that returned to wow with me said he didnt remember it being so silly
[1:25:03] Toiarc: That character transmog is really gooodo
[1:25:09] futureforgotten: 10.1 story was really good
[1:25:11] kanatran: Thr soul split route was not good I would have preffered she was mindfucked as Anduin plus what the hell are those lava eels from the book WTF
[1:25:13] Deatheran: its lighter than "big bad going ot end the universe so lets all group up and stop it" *avengers music plays*
[1:25:37] Frosted2319: like you said though some of the voice lines maybe
[1:25:50] Dagomarus: i think the enslavement of the dragons by the titans is very not childish imo
[1:25:53] witchhobbit: that makes so much sense
[1:26:01] gronnlir: gronnlir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:26:13] Lerker3: Hey Tali; while we're on this subject, have you seen the comic "That Cinematic Where Uther and Sylvanas Talked in Shadowlands Plus Everything that Led Up To It Except Now I Like It". It's SOOO good. If you google it you'll find it
[1:26:39] Dagomarus: sylvanus even before she was dead was a pragmatist so its not suprising she was able to accept herself
[1:26:39] casualviewerxqt: I agree. The themes are quite interesting but the way they delivered seemed like they were treating their audience like children. I personally got to the point where I got a little bit offended by how "personality lacking" the delivery was. Idk if Im making myself clear
[1:27:02] AlfredK: Can you explainit please because I really don't know.
[1:27:04] awkswow: What level can you start Shadowlands again? I kinda want to play through the whole story again
[1:27:05] Alonarius: I like the game now, I like the story now and it's direction, but I won't forget that we'll never get the exploration of female characters trauma like Sylvanas and Helya explored
[1:27:05] khalcrux_gaming: Split pause this one ok now fuse them and the past side isn't down with what they did.
[1:27:07] Proxzo: you eat poop seeds
[1:27:07] aeson_of_raid_sock: wow was silly in vanilla
[1:27:09] Popicus: Have they not played the badlands?
[1:27:10] Sch1ey: Its less silly then ever... there isnt even a poop quest..?
[1:27:12] bucephalos: plants vs zombies quest
[1:27:14] Arlaeya: So many poop quests
[1:27:19] aeson_of_raid_sock: the chuck norris references
[1:27:22] Carrot1449: wow's been silly since wc3
[1:27:28] Nulgar: Warcraft has been silly since WC3 tneEvi before it was mostly trying to be a Warhammer clone, so you could say the silliness is the IDENTITY of Warcraft
[1:27:30] TVNems: Listen to warcraft 3 voice lines, its arguably the most silly Warcraft ever was
[1:27:31] dright424: WoW has always been silly, it just didnt have cutscenes and voice acting, so people didnt notice
[1:27:47] DrGreatScott: 1st memorable quest in TBC is "pick up felboar poop" Super serious quests
[1:27:52] Discordant_Hats: Excuse you Tali, Orc Peons have always been an extremely serious reflection of a downtrodden underclass.
[1:28:09] Carrot1449: kalec is the only aspect i think ive ever related to or felt was written to be a real character
[1:28:13] Derployd: The issue with the writing of the aspects existed in Cata, it was my only fear going in to this expansion
[1:28:31] HazMatt_Prime: Can you imagine having a beer with Alexstraza? She'd be sooooo boring.
[1:28:31] Lerker3: Especially the old ones... Kalecgos has a lot of emotion and personality though
[1:28:35] Triskelian: @discordant_hats "Me not that kind of orc!"
[1:28:35] SirSheepalot: i feel a little bit like that whenever chromie is on screen
[1:28:40] Tenga66: Dragonkin-dragons relationship and resolution seemed like it was a "Alexstraszas abuse theme park with an instant resolution"
[1:28:44] Dagomarus: i think the dragons could have deeper motivations it felt abit bland at times
[1:28:45] liveshowfieldy: even earlier than that too, there’s literally a James Brown dungeon boss in wrath ahah
[1:28:54] flaccid_rage: The Vyranoth story was amazing
[1:29:34] Dagomarus: the deepest motivated flight is the black flight, i was fully bought into that storyline
[1:29:35] casualviewerxqt: Yea. I think the story is good, but the way they tell the story is what i don't like. BUT I still think they gonna pull up a "Fire and Blood" brutal masacre in the following expansion where they're gonna kill most of dragons. I think that would explain why they spent so much time developing dragon characters in this expansion
[1:29:37] the_howlermonkey: i think the Alex treatment was intentional... I think she might be exiting the story
[1:29:43] s7wede: personally I can't stand her as a character but I understand that she isn't written for me. I have always liked the darker storylines and characters
[1:29:55] aeson_of_raid_sock: I watched nixxxiom dump on the trading post items because there’s pink and hearts. that it’s not Warcraft. I feel like these people have a warped view of this franchise
[1:29:55] DrGreatScott: For the only dragon to actually engage in claw and teeth fights, she had no bite. It was really weird
[1:29:57] Lerker3: Nozdormu feels so useless though. Like I get why they can't use him seeing the future to solve problems but it really is funny how often he's like "THE FUTURE IS HAZY"
[1:29:57] Derployd: As a reminder, people hated BfA for being too serious all the time, and that the lack of let up into and through Shadowlands was core to why people hated those expansions.
[1:30:03] futureforgotten: blue dragonflight questline traveling the world might have been the best overall storytelling and character moments ive seen in a game. Sindragosa was heartbreaking
[1:30:06] Discordant_Hats: Everyone seems to dislike the Chromie stuff and think it should all be a fakeout, that Murozond should return later, that this was a huge misstep. ...I feel a bit in the minority hoping that was legitimately the conclusion.
[1:30:07] skewlbeta: Would love if it had her questioning some of the titan influence as well
[1:30:17] Dagomarus: and still be being in charge by the end of it is the true miracle
[1:30:22] SirSheepalot: i loved the clip of "huh i had not considered this" you did in a recent video
[1:30:24] AlfredK: Lol the new trading post stuff is sick
[1:30:30] bucephalos: Alexstrasza and the red flight did not get her own patch content like all the others
[1:30:31] Tenga66: "The ignorant lovable cheerleader finds out world doesn't work that way"
[1:30:34] thunduz: ummm go look at most of the armor from BC. Most of that was purple and pinks lol
[1:30:40] witchhobbit: oh no pink
[1:30:48] DarthTaz0: I spent nearly 2k tendies this month on the Trading post. It was an awesome month.
[1:30:49] toast042: i loved the 10.1 dracthyr and black dragonflight storylines so much! found the end-raid cutscene really emotional
[1:30:54] databob1: Nixxium? W
[1:30:56] toast042: then i went online and discovered people hated it hahah
[1:30:56] RosieSeren: there's plenty of dark spiky things in wow, having cute and more 'girly' things, has been so nice
[1:31:17] Frosted2319: im not sure what he meant exactly lol maybe with the newer facial animations and maybe some of the dialog
[1:31:18] GameingAspect: i stan it to and the gameplayt
[1:31:29] databob1: I've been waiting for the heaters to come out about love is in the air
[1:31:33] Dagomarus: but everything we set out to do at the beginning of the expansion we achieved tbh
[1:31:39] HazMatt_Prime: I had a highlighted message while you were watching that video. Were you be able to see it?
[1:31:53] grimblymcgoo: I just hope that blizz makes DF the 20-70 experience for TWW.
[1:32:06] kanatran: What did they use to reactivate them?
[1:32:12] Enigmio: the spudiest thing was the whole ysera think....so useless
[1:32:16] dright424: My main criticism on DF is 10.1 felt a bit under utilized story wise.
[1:32:17] KhrysW: @grimblymcgoo Agree!
[1:32:42] SirSheepalot: Oh 100%
[1:32:46] Tubbybaggins: 100% agreed
[1:32:56] Mosquithor: I think they improved a lot when it comes to storytelling but they need to improve a bit more
[1:33:00] Frosted2319: yea sylvanas was just clueless though. shes like look what i did when bringing back the scourge and everyone is like what have you done. what makes you any different than the lich king? shes just like im for the horde
[1:33:04] grimblymcgoo: oh true
[1:33:12] Discordant_Hats: Fighting one boss and then turning back time to fight another instead, was an extremely cool meshing of mechanics and narrative.
[1:33:14] Derployd: "Bad" dialogue has always been an issue. Do people remember Deathwing's "speech"  in the Dragon Soul raid? Even if it was read like someone forgetting their lines, it was awfully written
[1:33:21] Beyondvalor: I hope they sort out the Dragonflight story progression for new players tho. 10.0-10.2 is a mess for new players
[1:33:34] SirSheepalot: That assumes you go intoi the Vault raid as part of leveling thoi
[1:33:35] Lerker3: I hope the pacing is good; because otherwise you hit max level and chromie ports you right out to ferry you to current xpac
[1:33:36] grimblymcgoo: @Beyondvalor most of that wont be necessary for leveling though
[1:33:39] witchhobbit: i love that you get story in dungeons and raid but at the same time it is really easy to miss. i've never been able to take my time in dungeons/raids
[1:33:42] blumberquack: Come to think of it, would they make the leveling for WSS cover the entire saga? So if you start playing during Midnight you still get to play War Within
[1:33:47] knightjudicator: the question isnt if DF will stay the leveling campaign, but how each previous WSS expansion will be told between DF and the current Saga
[1:33:50] Derployd: I only meant that people bahve like its a recent issue
[1:34:02] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can you believe its breaking news in USA that Joe Biden is old
[1:34:04] Beyondvalor: @grimblymcgoo I mean ideally new players will also experience Emerald dream and such
[1:34:08] Mosquithor: Its a lot better but it needs more improvement still
[1:34:18] s7wede: I still think they should expand on the follower dungeon experience and create follower scenarios that give brief previews of the current raids so that you can complete the DF storyline as a whole without needing to step foot in a raid
[1:34:21] casualviewerxqt: would you agree with the idea that people's reception about DF story is a combination of both people media iliteracy, prejudice about more progressive representation in the game AND the inhability to deliver an actual exciting story that the audience would be excited for?
[1:34:25] Tenga66: It's funny how WoW turned from "text that you read in your head to make the tone" to "voiced and set tone, that might not match what you imagined"
[1:34:26] Mazerbeam: It's only breaking news to Joe, he forgot!
[1:34:40] Derployd: No one past retirement age should be allowed to run
[1:34:53] AlfredK: Unrelated but I wish we would get the cinematic quality character models :<
[1:34:56] Thoreya: watch him win again LUL
[1:34:59] cabeshpash: should've been Bernie :(
[1:35:00] aeson_of_raid_sock: we got Biden instead of Bernie. thanks Obama lol
[1:35:04] witchhobbit: only the people 40+ thought he was the best choice
[1:35:05] Beyondvalor: nooo don't say that Tali, I can't do a Trump second term x.x
[1:35:08] the_moltar: should've always been bernie
[1:35:10] dday_movies: you’re 100% right. Biden has like no chance this time around.
[1:35:21] Jeanie130: Re: Joe. I said that to my mom. Her response, "but he's a nice guy." That's not a reason to elect someone.
[1:35:24] Thoreya: current polls trump is only up 2%
[1:35:26] Mazerbeam: I can't wait for the debates, it will be like my two grandpas with dementia arguing at Thanksgiving dinner. Oh and 1 is a racist!
[1:35:27] knightjudicator: @Beyondvalor Biden is arming a genocide...
[1:35:32] Efendal: taliesin is a bernie or bust guy :O
[1:35:34] witchhobbit: @Jeanie130 LUL
[1:35:48] DrGreatScott: Status quo broken capitalism vs. Even more broken fascist capitalism
[1:35:49] cabeshpash: trump is way worse than biden
[1:36:02] dday_movies: Biden is a harm reduction guy. Trump is a harm doer. Neither is good for us, but Biden is SLIGHTLY better.
[1:36:05] Toiarc: How? What defines him as racist? Can you give me news stating this also?
[1:36:07] Alarius_: he is in some states
[1:36:08] placeholdername33: polls are useless this early
[1:36:08] cabeshpash: yeah it's bad
[1:36:10] Alarius_: but yeah
[1:36:12] skewlbeta: being an american is exhausting
[1:36:13] Popicus: Yeah and Dems have to win by +2 in the popular vote to even have a shot at the electoral college
[1:36:14] Thoreya: why would that change anything, it’s obvious he’s gonna be the nominee
[1:36:17] databob1: It's gonna suck ether way
[1:36:17] cabeshpash: I may have to move out of the US if trump wins again
[1:36:19] Discordant_Hats: At least on US soil. Definitely pushes that racism worldwide with his current use of the military.
[1:36:24] blumberquack: My condolences to all americans having to pick between two clowns :p
[1:36:25] bettys_dungeon_adventures: for all intents and purposes trump is the nominee, its a given at this point
[1:36:25] Tenga66: Biden himself, when he won, said what describes him best: "Nothing will fundamentally change"
[1:36:27] netonkent: G
[1:36:27] Deatheran: @knightjudicator no matter what the US president will be arming a genocide. they actualy have laws in the US that makes not supporting Israel illegal...
[1:36:31] Nexusshade: @TaliesinAndEvitel I really liked the priest interview vid keep up the amazing work! kyriel5Love
[1:36:36] knightjudicator: @Toiarc 1994 crime bill.........
[1:36:36] Carrot1449: he's arming a genoicde in the middle east i think thats at leats a little racist
[1:36:43] neverbornlucky: Taliesin they  couldn't  crimenal charge joe biden cause he's old and the jury would feel sorry for him
[1:36:46] s7wede: Biden created a crime bill in the past that resulted in the incarceration of thousands of black men since the late 80's
[1:37:06] FootballFarsam: we complain about Trump and Biden but we fantasize in a game about Guldan and Arthas lmfao
[1:37:06] grimblymcgoo: @s7wede He also wanted to cut basically every single social welfare program
[1:37:09] databob1: It total is
[1:37:14] Efendal: capitalism allows democracy to exist. but when the profit margins aren't high enough, the road to fascism is really short
[1:37:23] ArkyteCurse: Let's put it this way. given the choice between Biden and trump, the KKK, neo-nazis, etc are all voting for trump. if the racists choose you you're probably racist
[1:37:24] Brukhalian: America’s still such a young and developing nation, I wish it wasn’t a superpower - it’s a lot of power for the wrong country…
[1:37:31] markaud23: @Efendal ancient greece?
[1:37:33] Enigmio: omg...
[1:37:34] khalcrux_gaming: Lol no...it doesn't
[1:37:37] Enigmio: ban this guy
[1:37:41] SirSheepalot: ye lol no
[1:37:47] Tenga66: Ancient greeks, the oldest capitalist society dsaKEKW
[1:37:54] cabeshpash: every president has been upholding the status quo tho
[1:38:00] neverbornlucky: England is more of a democracy then USA
[1:38:02] Carrot1449: democracy on a federal level *maybe* but in your every day life especially in the workplace u have no say in what happens
[1:38:05] HazMatt_Prime: Ah yes, politics! That's what I came here for!
[1:38:07] Carrot1449: thats not democratic
[1:38:12] knightjudicator: @Efendal they're saying capitalism's violent enforcers allow democracy, which is true.
[1:38:17] grimblymcgoo: Obama sure loved bombing brown people
[1:38:19] s7wede: people forget the USA is a republic and not just a democracy
[1:38:20] 안티가: 안티가 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months, currently on a 57 month streak! 
[1:38:28] Frosted2319: that is the really problem all of them no matter the side they have the same agenda
[1:38:47] saarkhastick: @Brukhalian I feel like we (the US) are going through our rebellious "teen years". I just hope we live through it to make it to the mature, head out of our collective ass stage.
[1:38:54] Copiumgold: @neverbornlucky no its really not, no body voted for the last 3 prime ministers
[1:38:56] Brukhalian: @neverbornlucky England (and the rest of the UK) has to suffer the unelected House of Lords, though - broken democracy.
[1:38:58] Carrot1449: also your governm,ent being bought out by corporations is anti-democracy
[1:38:59] aeson_of_raid_sock: democracy is left wing, capitalism right wing. basically
[1:39:01] AlonBinyamin: I alway thought Democracy is the best form of governance humanity created, but still it's not good enough. It's barely functional and we just stopped trying to improve.
[1:39:09] Frosted2319: exactly
[1:39:11] cabeshpash: @saarkhastick not I think it's the twilight years for us
[1:39:12] neverbornlucky: Taliesin, Nicki Haley said that if she  wins Texas can leave the USA
[1:39:20] Efendal: no no, i do not mean capitalism is required for democracy. capitalism allows some form of democracy in the status quo in the sense of: it could abolish democracy as soon as something else promises more profits, more control and so on
[1:39:34] Tenga66: “There is only one good, profit, and one evil, commie scum.” -- Socrates
[1:39:51] knightjudicator: @Efendal which is correct, capitalism LOVES fascism
[1:39:53] Brukhalian: First past the post isn’t representative, I agree with you wholeheartedly, Tali.
[1:40:09] KeyouiX: KeyouiX subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:40:10] saarkhastick: @cabeshpash It does feel like that quite often.
[1:40:13] awkswow: @Tenga66 famous quote he stole from Michael Scott
[1:40:13] maialinovolante: The US is such a rich country and, instead of using it to help their people, they keep a system which is so unfair with themselves. There are people whor are not rich but certainly not poor who have to ask for money when they have medical issues. European democracies are less rich but they try to put money to help citizens...
[1:40:14] saarkhastick: Fuck the EC
[1:40:19] futureforgotten: Not really sure that playing the "both sides" card is great here in America. While I understand both sides have their flaws, trump is literally planning to be a dictator for at least a day and has openly claimed it. Biden isnt doing that
[1:40:20] the_moltar: electoral college is fucking stupid
[1:40:23] casualviewerxqt: i feel people have a kink for democracy and formal freedom when China and Singapore exist
[1:40:25] ArkyteCurse: The electoral college is a sham
[1:40:42] cabeshpash: the electoral college was established to give rich white men more power
[1:40:51] Aestrian: I think America uses first past the post for their senate elections, same as the UK :)
[1:40:58] Copiumgold: @maialinovolante US is trillions in debt and counting it's not rich
[1:41:01] Carrot1449: i live ina  country that uses first past the post how is it not democratic genuinely curious
[1:41:03] bettys_dungeon_adventures: the electoral college vote split is up the the individual state
[1:41:08] Lerker3: The best part is that the electoral college is technically not REQUIRED to vote the way their districts do
[1:41:12] ArkyteCurse: the least populated states in the US also have more pull than the majority of the population in the EC system
[1:41:13] awkswow: @maialinovolante you don't understand national debt
[1:41:14] 안티가: we'll never have a popular vote because only one party would ever win, wonder why that is
[1:41:17] Teth33: Texas is usually the opposite, but same thought.
[1:41:17] witchhobbit: currently there is a similar political climate in the UK right now, yeah?
[1:41:19] hitchmeister59: The Electoral College was a clunky work around for limited communication infrastructure 250 years ago.
[1:41:22] Aakku: "Every vote counts" but in some  states are 60% for one party or the other, and you feel like you throwing your vote into a wall.
[1:41:22] bettys_dungeon_adventures: not all states work like texas but most red states do
[1:41:28] knightjudicator: @futureforgotten there is an entire world outside of the US with billions of people in it. Biden is doing that overseas. those people still matter.
[1:41:33] databob1: Yeah there are some states that don't do that but not many
[1:41:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can you believe that Donald Trump is not rich now . He can't say mean things to women anymore online
[1:41:57] kiewies: Would you like genocide lite or genocide? The American choice lol
[1:42:03] khalcrux_gaming: When the least populated state and the highest have the same amount of representatives is bad
[1:42:03] grimblymcgoo: @neverbornlucky The same russian banks that took him out of bankruptcy before will do it again
[1:42:06] futureforgotten: @knightjudicator youre right and they definitely do matter. but trump is worse no matter how you split it
[1:42:07] Teth33: My state has opted for a national popular vote if it ever does get changed.
[1:42:09] cabeshpash: are tories as batshit as conversitives here in the US?
[1:42:19] dday_movies: first across the post also makes third parties (that might better represent your views) unviable because it just takes votes away from the main party most otherwise similar to your views
[1:42:20] Vaephera: Just Maine, I think
[1:42:28] dright424: Nebraska and Maine
[1:42:28] Aakku: think iowa does it too
[1:42:29] 안티가: not obvious, opens the federal elections to gerrymandering. the best thing would be a straight popular vote, but will never happen
[1:42:39] witchhobbit: i was wondering that about tories and republicans
[1:42:40] s7wede: @TaliesinAndEvitel Is there currently a country that mirrors your ideal political structure?
[1:42:49] databob1: I thought 3 or 4 states but I'm not sure
[1:42:53] Brukhalian: Tactical voting worked recently to get rid of the Liberals (finally) in Australia.  Labour, much like in the UK, aren’t great, but they’re definitely the much lesser of the two bad choices.
[1:42:56] DrGreatScott: My audio went oout. Were you discussing ranked voting that they have in Washington state?
[1:43:03] theszoti: anything that isnt a white, 50+ year old man
[1:43:26] hitchmeister59: Maine and Nebraska are the only non-winner-take-all states.

[1:43:54] AlfredK: All potliticans are dumb
[1:43:55] Alonarius: Tories to me always felt like that one teacher that saw the cool kids bullying the weird ones and joined in to be the cool teacher
[1:44:03] ChrisStoll: Republican-lite
[1:44:08] cabeshpash: there are real differences, but just not as many as we would like
[1:44:09] blumberquack: Labour fell so hard after Corbyn :p
[1:44:18] databob1: yup I abandoned both parties years ago
[1:44:23] KeyouiX: the difference is one doesn't give a shit about people and the other wants to kill minorities
[1:44:23] CasualR: F
[1:44:23] Discordant_Hats: As a trans lass, yeah feels kinda fucked!
[1:44:31] mckblitz: The liberals and conservatives in Canada just teamed up to stop electoral reform
[1:44:35] JimmyLCFC: @blumberquack lmaooo you mean "cause of corbyn"
[1:44:37] Alonarius: Labour fell so hard when Blaire got in
[1:44:39] elbardo_ts: wait, what?
[1:44:47] blumberquack: @JimmyLCFC Absolutely LUL
[1:44:51] krisz49: so now u think we will have an actual warcraft story and not a disney one ?
[1:44:51] cabeshpash: @Alonarius lol fucking Blaire
[1:45:01] JimmyLCFC: @blumberquack LUL
[1:45:08] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Was it the toxicity of the players, or toxicity within the company?
[1:45:10] dright424: If you live in the US there is a big difference at the State level between Dem and Rep, but at federal its more just Dems like to try to pass bills with more taxes, Reps just cut taxes
[1:45:11] TankenFunk: Most of UK and US politics is a shit show, but the right-leaning parties are just quicker to blame "the others" for everything
[1:45:12] databob1: I hope he finds a better company that treats him better
[1:45:14] holyzeke: do you think maybe he got fired over the Shadowlands criticism?
[1:45:19] Brukhalian: Lol, Tony Blair, the most embarrassing export from Scotland ever.
[1:45:20] theszoti: asmongold viewer spotted
[1:45:23] TankenFunk: women Kappa
[1:45:23] skeletonetiquette: "But the system has been working for hundreds of years why would we want to change it?" It's been working for a select few. Yeah. I guess.
[1:45:24] neverbornlucky: Taliesin did you hear Elon Musk wants to buy disney
[1:45:25] grimblymcgoo: @krisz49  nOt A dIsNeY

[1:45:35] GingerBear30: I think Shadowlands could have been great, if the story had been told in a better way. hot take.
[1:45:36] krisz49: no "war" in warcraft, 2 soft
[1:45:41] khalcrux_gaming: Put a chick in it? Just guessing their answer.
[1:45:42] Teldrin89: malfurion and tyrande like 180 from W3 days?
[1:45:44] Aestrian: I live in the UK now but growing up in a country where we have a proportional voting, its very interesting to see that quite a lot of brits support first past the post, i think your opinion is a minority in favour of representational. I've heard arguments of representational voting will lead to coalition government which lead to an overall weak government, which i fundamentally disagree, but I have noticed it's a majority opinion in the uk
[1:45:47] Caladin_the_Paladin: There are stark differences in my opinion. Primarily in this upcoming election: one candidate is representing the status quo and the other is literally calling for the suspension of our Constitution. Apart from that on a larger scale, I think the key difference for me is that one party has members pointing to the problems and calling them out and the other party bends over backwards to protect the problems from being solved.
[1:45:47] markaud23: jesus
[1:45:48] kanatran: Lorewise pvp makes no sense that's  a biy disneyish
[1:45:48] Merex760: It feels more like Dragon Tails and less Warcraft
[1:45:49] Shanhayde: most disney stories come from horrible tales, just saying
[1:45:50] CeasiusPls: Bellular has called it Marvelization. Do we count Marvel as Disney?
[1:45:51] Jeanie130: It's only Disney if all the moms die and a male comes in and saves the female.
[1:45:54] markaud23: mulan
[1:45:56] ChrisStoll: Don't tell him about Pocahontas
[1:46:03] elbardo_ts: war is the entire point of mulan
[1:46:03] Shanhayde: What about Mulan ?
[1:46:04] grimblymcgoo: Sounds like a really soft conservative comment
[1:46:05] avatos_94: acholon?
[1:46:08] Carrot1449: we're at war in DF, we're fighting the incrnates
[1:46:09] netonkent: Didn't Chris write literally king ku panda expansion haha was good though
[1:46:10] REDSUNDERGROUND: @ChrisStoll XD
[1:46:10] Mazerbeam: Star WARS (owned by Disney)
[1:46:10] futureforgotten: we are literally at war with multiple forces though
[1:46:12] Proxzo: Star Wars is a disney movie
[1:46:18] krisz49: 2 heavy on emotions
[1:46:19] Proxzo: War is in the name
[1:46:19] neverbornlucky: Taliesny would you still support Disney if Elon Musk owned it
[1:46:23] theszoti: quit the shit, everyone called the war in bfa stupid and childish and tireing
[1:46:25] Alonarius: That was a non-answer from the commenter
[1:46:26] markaud23: lmao
[1:46:27] futureforgotten: he wants to go back to BFA and committing war crimes? Cause that shit sucked
[1:46:28] PariahG: Mulan, quite famously
[1:46:36] grimblymcgoo: @krisz49 2 legit 2 quit
[1:46:36] Sikuq: warcraft was tough back in warcraft 2 days
[1:46:36] databob1: I like the story right now...I think theres a quiet part to the no war in warcraft cry
[1:46:40] CeasiusPls: Bellular has called it Marvelization. Do we count Marvel as Disney?
[1:46:46] Carrot1449: alliance vs horde is a tired story point. it was fun but im ready and glad to move on
[1:46:47] Harai_Ulfsark: disney so soft, a kid sees his uncle killing his father and live with guilty for his whole life
[1:46:48] markaud23: people.. what are we doing here
[1:46:52] CasualR: "shill for blizz" obviously Kappa
[1:46:56] Lerker3: Well you're giving them free advertising right now @TaliesinAndEvitel Kappa
[1:46:57] Dogjah: I am mad at the Worgen story line, way to soft! The King is not dead and why are they all stepping out of the way for their daughters that did something they could not??? Come on... I am sorry they killed the worgen story line..
[1:47:00] elbardo_ts: disney owns a franchise with the word war in it
[1:47:10] AlonBinyamin: You have a smile of a disney princess XD
[1:47:11] knightjudicator: @futureforgotten i dont feel the same, as Biden/Dems have barely completed any of their promises nor rolled back enough of Trump's bullshit. but i also think we can agree to disagree when there's better fights to fight together
[1:47:11] ChrisStoll: Chat getting weird 2 hours in
[1:47:11] RosieSeren: I really don't understand the calling wow story disney, I think its a lack of media literacy tbh
[1:47:13] Aakku: i mean... we all know you are shill. lol
[1:47:14] neverbornlucky: Taliesin because I heard you were excited to play disney fortnite
[1:47:15] LordKurgen: I remember a Disney movie where a witch kicks the crap out of Nazis with magic medieval knights
[1:47:21] grimblymcgoo: @Sikuq Or maybe you were 10?
[1:47:23] aeson_of_raid_sock: tali, would you still eat kfc if Elon musk owned it?
[1:47:25] the_howlermonkey: ive never felt like WOW, the MMO was a wargame.. that shit stopped with the RTSs.. this has always been that way.. the WAR in warcraft gang isout of touch and has been since the 90s
[1:47:27] Nulgar: it's rather that Marvel copies video game logic
[1:47:29] grimblymcgoo: @grimblymcgoo Go replay, not that tough
[1:47:32] elbardo_ts: bfa literally had a winnie the poo reference
[1:47:34] Caladin_the_Paladin: @grimblymcgoo 100%
[1:47:35] Proxzo: Chris LOVES comics
[1:47:36] Shanhayde: @krisz49 Why is it a problem to be more focused on emotions ? genuine question
[1:47:36] schlakt: just got to say, your mog is looking tasty! love the mage legs!
[1:47:49] Syzmical: idk chris hasnt invited me over recentlyu
[1:47:49] GingerBear30: If anything marvel got blizzardified :D
[1:47:51] Sikuq: @grimblymcgoo I was 10 at that time =)
[1:47:51] khalcrux_gaming: Cause DeSantis is gross, you're not gross and he hates Disney so they made an equation to piece that together
[1:47:57] CeasiusPls: TBH I'd prefer Arcane over Marvel
[1:48:05] TankenFunk: yes but metzen is based and chad so it's ok actually
[1:48:08] TankenFunk: tneEvi
[1:48:12] krisz49: I feel like the story went soft, leaning too heavily on emotions, which is fine (in moderation)
[1:48:18] grimblymcgoo: @Sikuq So 10 year old you and 35 year old you both think the same thing is "tough". Jesus my guy
[1:48:27] Proxzo: They want Warhammer 40k
[1:48:28] LolitaAldea: I heard some people complain about the screenchot of malfurion, Tyrande and shandris in their garden calling it girly and spineless :(
[1:48:29] krisz49: yes
[1:48:31] JMcGhee559: i did cry during moana fwiw
[1:48:31] Shanhayde: @krisz49 I mean, most wow lore is HUGE on emotions
[1:48:32] knightjudicator: IF YOUR GAME DOESNT HAVE EMOTIONAL BEATS YOU HAVE NO REASON TO CARE
[1:48:32] KeyouiX: emotions are bad?
[1:48:33] TankenFunk: I like emotions in my video games, actually
[1:48:34] AlfredK: Based. Argent Dawn is the best.
[1:48:37] khalcrux_gaming: They mean putting a woman out front
[1:48:38] theszoti: don't try to understand it tali, it's just a stupid buzzword lol
[1:48:38] Alonarius: Name one good story that explores emotion Tally
[1:48:39] awkswow: Yeah didn't they make the movie where they personified each emotion? lol
[1:48:39] Proxzo: I think people want WoW to be GrimDank
[1:48:39] KatieRet_: girly emotions?
[1:48:41] DozlaT: even if so, are we not allowed emotion in our video game?
[1:48:42] skeletonetiquette: I think they mean specific ones
[1:48:43] elbardo_ts: they have a movie literally about emotions
[1:48:44] aeson_of_raid_sock: I don’t get the MCU comparisons. It’s still just one property, not a connected story of multiple things
[1:48:45] urbenjames: ewww emotions
[1:48:47] RosieSeren: why don't you want emotion in a story? that's good storytelling
[1:48:47] Jeanie130: Emotions are a good thing. I don't want a flat, emotionless game.
[1:48:48] Harai_Ulfsark: good stories dont have emotion?
[1:48:48] witchhobbit: i mean why is being big on emotions not good anyway
[1:48:53] Carrot1449: arthas is a character that was very emotional and he's considered the innacle of warcraft storytelling
[1:48:55] databob1: if it gets us more like the azeroth assemble cini8matic im good
[1:48:58] elbardo_ts: inside out is a movie about emotions
[1:48:58] Alonarius: Name ONE good piece of media or content that's good that has emotion in it
[1:49:01] DrGreatScott: I'm curious how they feel about the final fight between Thrall and Garrosh
[1:49:02] Sikuq: @grimblymcgoo dont shame me for liking warcraft 2 lol :)
[1:49:07] aerohokie: Inside Out is very emotional tneTali
[1:49:08] TankenFunk: These people claim to hate emotions yet they also hate the Jailer? Really makes you think Kappa
[1:49:08] Brewmaster_Holsten: the warhammerfication of warcraft. smh
[1:49:11] skeletonetiquette: Cause a no emotion story is. Well shit.
[1:49:20] avatos_94: the hells a story without emotions
[1:49:23] CeasiusPls: Wow used to be a darker story. Arcane is a good example of handling darker story matter better
[1:49:27] Dazzaw17: @Brewmaster_Holsten now that id play!
[1:49:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin tell us what you really think of disney Fortnite coming soon
[1:49:33] khalcrux_gaming: Zuckerberg?
[1:49:57] RosieSeren: its also making a story that is more commercially viable as well, they want more players for more money
[1:49:57] Ealdfox: "Lok'Tar Ogar!" obviously means "I'm a rational and emotion-less being"
[1:49:58] elbardo_ts: it's just a catch phrase
[1:50:00] Dogjah: A king or Queen never relinquishes their crown or responsibilities and then sides with the enemies they fought for years. They should have had  King Greymane seize the undead at the end!!!!
[1:50:11] SirSheepalot: i'm like 80% sure the emotions guy is trolling
[1:50:14] AlfredK: I mean it does feel a bit childish and not gritty sometimes
[1:50:15] awkswow: @CeasiusPls I don't think I agree that WoW's story was ever dark. There were dark moments but it's always been "the heroes come out on top through teamwork and friendship"
[1:50:15] GingerBear30: the lego fortnite survival game is great!
[1:50:21] Jeanie130: My assumption - they may mean that emotional are those emotions traditionally associated with females vs "acceptable" male emotions.
[1:50:33] kanatran: Lorewise pvp and world pvp makes no sense atm.  At least with metzen we got hyped most of the time but never cringed as hard as we did with "avenger like" cinematic before fire Drake boss raid. Even fucking mechatorke showed up.  You gotta admit there was no pay up for what whatever they wanted to achieve by that scene (plus they all aim like stormtroopers)
[1:50:35] TankenFunk: @Dogjah They do, actually
[1:50:35] grimblymcgoo: @AlfredK What are you looking for?
[1:50:38] hitchmeister59: As someone who doesn't play Fortnite, what does that even mean?
[1:50:41] CeasiusPls: @awkswow I'd disagree, look at Thrall's Origin story as an example
[1:50:43] avatos_94: lmao 🤦🏻‍♂️
[1:50:48] cardrenn: @Dogjah some people clearly didnt study history
[1:50:55] mxfelwinter: epic games already owned by a multinational megacorp (tencent), it won't make a difference
[1:50:55] Mundani: I think there is a massive 40k fanbase who also like other franchises, and is so based in Warhammer, that they get annoyed when Jaina Proudmoore hasn't choked on corpse starch during an expansion arc.
[1:50:56] databob1: disney fortnite my niece will like that
[1:50:58] Shanhayde: I mean, didn't greymane litterally CHASED sylvanas for 2 whole expansions ?
[1:51:00] LolitaAldea: the character was closing a chapte rof his life
[1:51:01] Dogjah: That shouldn't have happen.. so sappy
[1:51:02] Deatheran: Also rulers abdicate all the time what??? There's even a whole word for it
[1:51:07] Discordant_Hats: It's tough because at the end of the day, WoW has to appeal to the silent majority, it's gotta stay in business. So we can go back and forth with story changes but ultimately it'll usually represent what's in pop-culture right now. "Disneyfication" means many things, because it's many different people being unable to properly word the ways they want WoW to be more subversive than it's likely to be.
[1:51:11] theszoti: *former enemies, just take a look at history if you think that that is unrealistic
[1:51:15] neverbornlucky: Taliesin does that mean your daughter is going to be taking over wow streams when you pass down the kingdom
[1:51:19] Lightistor: Lightistor subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! heyo Tali. just dropped by to say hi. hope all's good :D
[1:51:21] Nulgar: @Dogjah there's been peace for 5 years. Do you think the de-facto winners of wars should attack their former enemies again later, despite efforts to reconciliate?
[1:51:23] CeasiusPls: WoW is honestly too camp, I would prefer a darker story. Like Arcane
[1:51:23] Efendal: warcraft was always heavy on emotions. also on the "soft" ones. khadgars uncertainty about medivh and his self-doubts in The Last Guardians for example. or the love story of alleria and turalyon in Tides of Darkness/Beyond the Dark Portal, which is almost as sappy and spicy as the dragonlance novel love stories
[1:51:23] KyleS07: I feel like he gave up his crown, knowing he couldn't change, but that change is necessary.
[1:51:24] Syzmical: guzuSmug
[1:51:28] khalcrux_gaming: She would have
[1:51:29] HazMatt_Prime: This does remind me of the Battle Within cinematic. You argued that people should get that Anduin has trauma. My thoughts were 'Why do I care about Anduin and his trauma? I don't care about his emotional journey. Go get help and see me when you're better, I have a world to save.'
[1:51:33] AlfredK: @AlfredK More real stuff I guess. Real life and more beliaveble stuff usually is a bit darker and has more layers to it.
[1:51:34] krisz49: compare it like WoD story, more "masculine" not afraid to kill characters, what Im trying to say big heary sweaty men fighting each other in the dirt :D
[1:51:38] Shanhayde: Nope she wasn't here, that's what i'm saying hehe, he didn't side with the ennemy
[1:51:38] kanatran: Her faction did
[1:51:48] s7wede: He abdicated to his daughter who has literally done nothing but whine about not being the golden child while Lorna Crowley gets shafted once again
[1:51:53] netonkent: But Tali he gave the crown to a girl sounds like low T to me haha
[1:51:55] databob1: he also sent help to loediron for menithil
[1:51:56] theszoti: @HazMatt_Prime wow
[1:51:59] cardrenn: cardrenn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[1:52:08] Rico_Azzarash: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco
[1:52:10] KhrysW: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco
[1:52:11] grimblymcgoo: @AlfredK You want more believable stuff in a game with timetraveling dragons?
[1:52:13] avatos_94: i think sometimes people straight up don’t understand the story told on purpose so they have something to complain about
[1:52:15] McRowbz: There has been so much Horde vs. Alliance content... I like the more team up vs big bad stuff more... Burning Crusade, Legion esc threats
[1:52:16] nokster: they fought against austria not germany
[1:52:19] Lerker3: only a few years later!
[1:52:19] Efendal: one thing to criticize about wow maybe is that the good guys never lose in a big way
[1:52:22] neverbornlucky: Taliesin what do you do when your children ask if they can play wow too ?
[1:52:24] kanatran: After 5 years?
[1:52:25] Carrot1449: greymane says in before the storm he could one day accept the forsaken but never while sylvanas was leading them. this was set up like 6 years ago
[1:52:27] Tubbybaggins: 100%
[1:52:28] elbardo_ts: hey tali, have you seen the tweet about the new ingame animation?
[1:52:32] john_fury_: More worrying is that you prefer Alliance which are proponents of hereditary monarchy. Are you a closeted monarchist?
[1:52:33] TankenFunk: Why didn't the UK simply eat Germany after WW2?
[1:52:37] Dogjah: He fought with the undead to take his city back, but he obviously wasn't happy about doing that.. Then wins back his city, gives his crown to his daughter and sails off to Disney for a break and meditation...
[1:52:46] urbenjames: its been longer then 5
[1:52:48] aeson_of_raid_sock: history is famously liberal biased
[1:52:48] AlfredK: @AlfredK More beliavble characters and motives yes. Just becuase magic exist doesn't mean it has to be bull
[1:52:52] kanatran: 5 years cool
[1:52:54] futureforgotten: literally 5 years passsed from shadowlands and DF
[1:53:02] Discordant_Hats: All that confuses me in those quests as it's stated to be done, partially because the Alliance helped the Forsaken reclaim Lordaeron. But they did that as like, secret spies right? They did that in disguise didn't they? (straight up what am I misremembering)
[1:53:07] Shanhayde: HE RESIGNED ffs, he wasn't happy lmao
[1:53:10] KyleS07: High Elves fought and killed Orcs on the side of the Alliance, and now that they're Blood Elves, they're apart of the Horde.
[1:53:14] Shanhayde: But he recognised he's flaws
[1:53:22] databob1: the us is allied with the uk must be bad writing
[1:53:38] Dogjah: Thats why he should have seized them at the end and that would have made a great story.... Greymane has always been a bit of a shaky dog..
[1:53:45] Nulgar: *Tess
[1:53:50] Lightistor: @KyleS07 that was the whole premise of zul'aman
[1:54:05] Nulgar: @Dogjah ah yes, war crimes, good story
[1:54:08] khalcrux_gaming: It would have been a dick move and he knew it
[1:54:29] avatos_94: starting the next war good story 👍🏼
[1:54:32] LolitaAldea: nor calia nor lilian took part on the gilneas war
[1:54:39] kanatran: Dude this was the moment to see bestial rage full worgen and we saw none. They missed the opportunity to give back the feeling why player choose worgen cuz come on Lycanthropy!!! But we got a touchy feely stuff imo
[1:54:51] Alonarius: I think what they're trying to get to is the alternate conclusion Nixxiom came up with in his latest video. He should have died learning nothing. Still hating, never gotten over the loss of his city, his son, and not taking revenge on Sylvanas.
[1:55:02] s7wede: It could have been a group of Putricide loyalists
[1:55:05] Mundani: seems like poor logistics that someone leaves an entire country for long enough for an entire faction to take over. Maybe plan these things, Genn/Calia.
[1:55:05] Dogjah: thumbs up brother...I agree and ya it could have made for a great side story for sure
[1:55:05] Alonarius: Which I don't agree with at all btw
[1:55:09] Nulgar: oof yes
[1:55:11] SirSheepalot: what do you mean?
[1:55:20] Carrot1449: that could have been really interesting
[1:55:25] alextheblight: meh...
[1:55:31] Harsbo: Harsbo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Evening, and congrats to Evi on the PS5!!!
[1:55:32] schlakt: its just so weird that the Forsaken moves out and the gilneans waited like ≈2 years to move in? just funny to me
[1:55:35] databob1: why?
[1:55:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin do you want to live with the night elves in the world tree or worgans in their old home
[1:55:38] alextheblight: I prefer what they went with
[1:55:47] neverbornlucky: player housing baby
[1:55:54] DrGreatScott: Didn't he get vengence already by destroying the lamp?
[1:56:03] Dogjah: He is at Disney right now with his girl, having a break and meditation deciding the next steps in destroying the forshaken lol....
[1:56:03] Proxzo: I think it's cool that Greymane realized he's not the right leader for this new era.
[1:56:24] DrGreatScott: Also, we already had "Garrosh learned nothing and stayed bad" character
[1:56:25] s7wede: What about Lorna Crowley. IMHO she deserves to rule over Tess
[1:56:26] thunduz: thunduz is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! 
[1:56:26] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to stuartystu! 
[1:56:26] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to luzya_! 
[1:56:26] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to Klaezee! 
[1:56:26] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to ScalpelHeals! 
[1:56:26] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to Kyle_Voltti! 
[1:56:37] alextheblight: @DrGreatScott now that you mention it, I don't think he chased after Sylvanas after that, yeah
[1:56:48] Lerker3: That's the least realistic part to me, an old man stepping down? Kappa
[1:56:50] LolitaAldea: the foundation are there but scattered across the game
[1:56:51] Kyle_Voltti: @thunduz Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:56:56] AlfredK: The digs are alright
[1:57:05] Phenroi: Phenroi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Tell Evi happy birthday for me
[1:57:07] DrGreatScott: We needed more for the retaking of Gilneas 100%
[1:57:07] grimblymcgoo: @Proxzo Im interested to see if Genn goes off and does anything on his own. Maybe his own personal vendetta will play out since he was able to give up the throne.
[1:57:07] Shanhayde: The problem is more the length of it, more than the emotionnal part. Wow lost a bit of it's epicness (which is what most "its disneycraft" means, but don't know how to express their emotions)
[1:57:17] westvo: i left a comment on your podcast on this topic about how retaking gilneas shouldve been suramar or 5.3 barrens
[1:57:18] Dogjah: Ya but Greymane is a bit of a bad dog... Keep the bad dog story going,,, they are worgens not lambs..
[1:57:30] Tenga66: Imagine Quel'danas progression style liberation
[1:57:41] Mazerbeam: But Tail what shoulders are those?!
[1:57:44] Nulgar: @Dogjah they are Worgen not feral wolves
[1:57:47] Shanhayde: It would've been awesome to see the real tension of Greymane and everybody being scared of going to war again because of old principles
[1:57:48] Harai_Ulfsark: but that would be too much worgen centric content blizz cant do that
[1:57:54] thunduz: LOL sure thing
[1:57:55] Elrathir: Elrathir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months, currently on a 59 month streak! HELLO I LIKE WHEN KING GREY MAN TURNS INTO THE BIG WOLF :)
[1:57:59] knightjudicator: @Mazerbeam the new priest class shoulders from TP i think
[1:58:12] Lerker3: How can Tess lead the Worgen when she's just a human?
[1:58:19] Lerker3: Kappa
[1:58:20] knightjudicator: @Dogjah even wolves get tired
[1:58:21] DrGreatScott: @Nulgar Even then, a wolf does not carelessly attack without purpose
[1:58:23] TankenFunk: Greymane has also seen over and over again recently that being angry and vindictive only leads to more death and destruction and pain to all sides, and decided someone else would be better fit for the job. Give the man a break tneEvi
[1:58:28] CasualR: There was a quest about that!@
[1:58:29] Rico_Azzarash: can I added you on battle net? xD
[1:58:38] knightjudicator: @TankenFunk wow he got character development?!?!?!?!
[1:58:44] elbardo_ts: wasn't that the entire point of the heritage armor quest line?
[1:58:45] khalcrux_gaming: Not all of them are Worgens.
[1:58:46] Teth33: Not all Gilneans are Worgen.
[1:58:47] Nulgar: @Lerker3 Worgen aren't even actually a race, they're still cursed Humans of the Gilnean nation
[1:58:59] netonkent: Do you think people would be taking like this about mists if YouTube was as big back then
[1:58:59] Carrot1449: didnt they talk about that in the heritage quest for worgen back in bfa?>
[1:59:04] CasualR: There was an entire quest prepping Tess to lead the Gilneans without being a Worgen
[1:59:04] thunduz: Worgan's should be Nelf's
[1:59:07] urbenjames: its said in the gilnail heartage
[1:59:08] Lerker3: Yeah sorry, dropping my /s
[1:59:12] TankenFunk: @knightjudicator smh my head. Character development in MY video game?!?!?!
[1:59:25] Dogjah: Ya I just thought we could have had such a crazy, fun ride with the worgens.. I guess we will have to wait for the vampires or Pirates to make a crazy fun story line...
[1:59:43] Saevash: Well they embraced the curse so they are a race by now in shape and form
[1:59:54] Rico_Azzarash: I am so agree with the state, that we need a step by step delivery of such stories
[1:59:54] Nulgar: @TankenFunk oh that reminded me, I need to get some money from the ATM machine
[1:59:57] Dogjah: agreed!!!!
[1:59:57] Shanhayde: @TankenFunk Please do not woke my wolfy ancesters UwU let them be angry
[2:00:02] DrGreatScott: His ability to recognize that struggle is what sells it for me. Flawed character but honest in knowing his limits
[2:00:03] Lerker3: (There's literally a whole storyline about her thinking she needs the curse, etc)
[2:00:09] TankenFunk: He's wrong, knows he's wrong, chooses to be wrong but not drag everyone else down that same path. Kinda based if you ask me
[2:00:09] Saiyori: Dunno if you've talked about this yet, but there's a reddit post discussing Steve Denuser appearing to have left Blizzard on his LinkedIn
[2:00:12] blumberquack: To be honest, I actually think the gilnean storyline was long enough :p
[2:00:24] LolitaAldea: worguen cant have kids? right?
[2:00:34] Reminii91: I mean, have we seen a worgen "baby"?
[2:00:39] SouvlakiTheBest: WoW story have always been bad in general, but now that is also woke, it's extra bad.
[2:00:47] Lerker3: @Reminii91 There's the anima cell
[2:00:49] Saiyori: There was hinting but I wasn't sure abt the confirmation hehe
[2:00:59] DrGreatScott: There's no confirmation on Worgen reproduction or if the curse is passed on
[2:01:23] alextheblight: that's rough
[2:01:32] Deatheran: @SouvlakiTheBest i dont get it, what makes it woke?
[2:01:44] knightjudicator: @Deatheran i have to be awake to play it
[2:01:46] Saiyori: Yeah...that feelsbad
[2:01:47] Lightistor: that's bad to hear :(
[2:01:52] Discordant_Hats: I think what a lot of people *want* from Worgen (straight up Werewolves) clashes with the messaging (Gilneans first) so people are constantly asking for more viciousness, more war, more fighting, because at the end of the day it's just excuses to hopefully see angry werewolves.
[2:01:53] TankenFunk: women Kappa
[2:01:54] Deatheran: @knightjudicator eyyyyyyyyy
[2:01:54] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Treated poorly by coworkers? or by boss?
[2:01:58] Alonarius: And there it is
[2:01:58] theszoti: woke is when women
[2:01:58] CDNcameron: Grabs popcorn
[2:01:59] Vaephera: the dragon isles are woke
[2:02:00] YayFiber: Lots of grave dancing happening online around him. Felt gross.
[2:02:02] markaud23: lmao
[2:02:02] Mundani: "WoW being woke" is bait
[2:02:04] futureforgotten: woke is gay people
[2:02:04] alextheblight: treated like shit by the fans AND the bosses. That's fucking rough
[2:02:04] blumberquack: Oh boy lol
[2:02:04] vlaovich88: Haha "woke"
[2:02:10] frankenpimp2: you saw the hair colors they gave trolls, super woke
[2:02:12] rei__03: too many women /s
[2:02:16] Alonarius: Please don't entertain this actually I'm sick of this
[2:02:18] elbardo_ts: nzoth is woke because it wanted to open our eyes. That's what being woke means, right?
[2:02:19] Rico_Azzarash: I'm sorry for asking. What does woke mean? Can someone enlighten me?
[2:02:20] Saiyori: Hang on, I'll make the popcorn. Who wants sodas?
[2:02:26] Saevash: Was
[2:02:27] Nulgar: @SouvlakiTheBest it was always woke. I mean, good Orcs and Trolls, female leaders, different races living together in harmony
[2:02:30] RosieSeren: I don't even understand what woke means
[2:02:32] khalcrux_gaming: lol woke. Like when someone said Dr. Who suddenly got woke.
[2:02:33] Lerker3: Thrall was woke when he freed the slave Orcs
[2:02:37] Shanhayde: fuck i used the word as a joke and now it's gone :c
[2:02:41] avatos_94: what does woke even mean at this point
[2:02:52] blumberquack: @frankenpimp2 Cool and all but they should've given us beards, then it'll be 100% not woke Kappa
[2:02:53] Carrot1449: woke is whatever i dont like
[2:02:57] saarkhastick: Isn't woke the opposite of asleep?
[2:02:57] blumberquack: (please give troll beards)
[2:03:00] witchhobbit: DinoDance
[2:03:00] MrAxeffect: woke means everything and nothing at the same time
[2:03:04] Nulgar: @avatos_94 anything left of "hunting the poor for sport"
[2:03:07] Osirisson: I'd rather be awake then asleep to what is happening in the world
[2:03:13] elbardo_ts: i hope tali read my shitty joke and died inside tneEvi
[2:03:15] Toiarc: Wtf is woke and why its issue?
[2:03:20] TankenFunk: I am woke, wow is woke, it is true
[2:03:23] holyzeke: the blood elves got all other good roles over the night elves
[2:03:24] netonkent: Do you think the bad treatment means dragon flight has gone worse they thought it would?
[2:03:32] alextheblight: chat scared him off lol
[2:03:46] Alonarius: If you don't like our society being "woke", Ukraine and Palestine are in dire need of strong alpha males like you lol
[2:03:54] mxfelwinter: people calling it woke is so weird to me, when wow story is very "might makes right" and "promonarchy"
[2:03:57] alextheblight: same
[2:03:58] DrGreatScott: I'm guessing woke to them means telling stories from different perspectives that make people who are far too comfortable with the status quo question their own viewpoint/beliefs
[2:04:04] witchhobbit: who is making popcorn? i'll take some!
[2:04:05] knightjudicator: it was originally an AAVE word to stay aware of racial injustice and police brutality
[2:04:06] Teth33: We have a kinder, gentler Tali today.
[2:04:40] derekdoesmusic: If it helps, you looks very handsome today
[2:04:40] JMcGhee559: @knightjudicator sorry, not familiar with the acronym AAVE, mind filling me in?
[2:04:42] KyleS07: I think we're getting daddy Tali today. And I'm here for it.
[2:04:44] mxfelwinter: WoW never question how 2/3 of azeroth are monarchies
[2:04:44] avatos_94: a troll and a ghost
[2:04:49] markaud23: I'm going to try and channel my inner tali when I get home with my kids tonight
[2:04:49] s7wede: What is your argument when people bring up the escapism argument for social awareness in video games?
[2:04:54] Rico_Azzarash: no, please, single me Tali... harder daddy xD
[2:04:55] Beyondvalor: Tali gentle parenting rn
[2:05:05] Saiyori: LUL
[2:05:06] knightjudicator: @JMcGhee559 African American Vernacular English (basically a dialect)
[2:05:12] Teth33: Woke is subjective. Unfortunately a lot of people have started using it to describe anything they disagree with.
[2:05:14] 6sixthousand6: we're gonna need a bridge and an exorcism
[2:05:15] JMcGhee559: @knightjudicator gotcha, thanks much
[2:05:15] the_howlermonkey: lol, ambiguously sexed Chromie makes the jesus crowd mad
[2:05:16] TheHardcorian: wow isnt woke it just has modern themes
[2:05:18] urbenjames: i think they mean. "more woman in the forfront"
[2:05:22] Efendal: acknowledging that power structures in society exist that cause different experiences for different groups of people makes for better, more real stories. people should be happy about it
[2:05:23] AlfredK: My personal interperation of the word woke is that include too many small mintorities because they have to and not because the story or game is served by it
[2:05:32] grimblymcgoo: @s7wede Are the orcs, trolls, dragons, and the actual content to do not provide any escapism?
[2:05:35] Saiyori: She's a girl
[2:05:36] Alonarius: WoW is woke (good) because there are gay relationships represented in
[2:05:37] Mundani: Warcraft dealt with "woke" subjects back in Warcraft 3, and the only reason it is a problem now is because some people like "alpha" influencers, who interpret anything that isn't straight white male-centric as being "woke".
[2:05:40] elbardo_ts: a badass
[2:05:42] Carrot1449: @s7wede good argument is that people who face discrimination irl also want to escape to a world where they can feel like they belong
[2:05:43] grimblymcgoo: @grimblymcgoo english...tough
[2:05:45] blumberquack: Chromie is Chromie B)
[2:05:46] avatos_94: a dragon
[2:06:07] the_howlermonkey: thx i typed that and was like 'noooooo.. that s not what I meant....'
[2:06:08] elbardo_ts: i love chromie in wow, i hate her in heroes of the storm
[2:06:10] databob1: adorable chromie is adorable
[2:06:12] Malfleur: Maybe also marcus and his (s)excapades in the steamy novels which are offered right now as way to "chilL" during the Love is in the Air?
[2:06:15] avatos_94: alexstrasza turns into a tree we’re so far beyond gender with dragon visages haha
[2:06:22] s7wede: @grimblymcgoo I'm not arguing in favor of it. I'm asking genuinely what your argument is when people say they don't want real world politics in games
[2:06:27] Alonarius: There's a trans person on the dev team pushing their child-grooming non-binary agenda (oh nooooo)
[2:06:30] mxfelwinter: people calling wow woke is as dumb and these are the same people that called ff14 apolitical...
[2:06:36] s7wede: I don't personally ascribe to it
[2:06:37] DrGreatScott: @s7wede I'd imagine escapism means different things for different people. Not everyone escapes the same thing.
[2:06:46] Saiyori: Not having playable tuskarr is a great injustice in wow
[2:06:56] neverbornlucky: Taliesin my brother in law asays his daughter can't have dolls cause the eyes follow him. He also says everything is woke
[2:07:00] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel the first time i heard the term "woke" when reffering to wow was back in shadowlands when they had a character that told us they were trans i think? the kyrian one.
[2:07:04] netonkent: Eso has gay couples none seems to complain, is wow just worse fan base
[2:07:05] harddrive4: @TaliesinAndEvitel   Woke can be bad when you think you have been enlightened to some truth that is actually false. Like white people are inherently racist.
[2:07:12] Osirisson: HUMAN RIGHTS IS NOT POLITICAL. People need to stop this BS
[2:07:16] grimblymcgoo: @TaliesinAndEvitel They were saying some people use the game for escapism. And I was trying to comment that there was plenty in the game that helps you escape
[2:07:17] Shanhayde: @avatos_94 We litterally have toys changing races and gender, human turning into wolves, dead people alive, i think gender is the easiest here ngl ;p
[2:07:25] markaud23: lmaooooooo
[2:07:44] elbardo_ts: wod gold inflation foretold argentine economics
[2:08:08] futureforgotten: @elbardo_ts ewhh get politics out of my vidya gahmes
[2:08:17] TankenFunk: "We live in a society" -Taliesin, 2024
[2:08:22] TankenFunk: He's on his Joker arc now
[2:08:23] adri_valeris: the WHOLE video game industry has made society more passive and immobile when it comes to political organization and movement. its almost a flawed discussion to have INSIDE this industry
[2:08:24] Saiyori: I've heard  "white people are inherently racist" from the left meaning that "white people have grown up with racism they are not aware of committing and should be made aware," which is p reasonable.
[2:08:27] Caladin_the_Paladin: That talking point comes from the discomfort right-wingers feel from looking in the mirror, at how their own perspectives and beliefs may be negatively impacting other peoples.
[2:08:27] holyzeke: well didn’t the dragon isles wake up so yea it’s woke
[2:08:31] DrGreatScott: Overgeneralizations of any group of people is bad. Recognizing that our systems have favored and granted things like white privilege is not
[2:08:36] DragnosiOfNede: @TaliesinAndEvitel  - WoW storytelling has leaned into Woke in a good way by celebrating things like the relationship between Khadgar and Kalecgos rather than hiding it or "leaving it unspoken"
[2:08:40] funviking99: hate when people say “white privilege”
[2:08:51] Jeanie130: I think people claim "woke" when the status quo of something they've been a part of for so long is changed  because the creators recognize that more than just white males play this game. Women play, lgtbqia+ people play. What is so wrong with opening an experience so all people can enjoy it rather than just one group?
[2:09:10] 6sixthousand6: there's a level of ignorance that a white person has to accept because they are never presented the oppression of racism in context
[2:09:18] Toiarc: Woke culture can be fixed for good purpose by making them unionise work places work forces by default making every larger corp have its own union that watches equal fair pay for everyone.
[2:09:19] kiewies: The fragility of the white identity prohibits an honest understanding that they might be benefitting from centuries of hard-baked oppression.
[2:09:21] Nickystr1x: you can have white privilege but not be a particularly privileged person. but at least being white didnt make your life harder
[2:09:32] funviking99: I never dealt with a situation where being white was above someone else’s  skin coordination
[2:09:39] neverbornlucky: Taliesin does your daughters dolls eyes follow you or is that a maga thing ?
[2:09:42] funviking99: color* sorry autocorect
[2:09:56] DrGreatScott: Imperialism crafted that system. It's an unfortunate historical fact that many are privileged to be able to ignore because they are born into a particular race or class
[2:10:13] skeletonetiquette: My life has really sucked at times in the past, it would be worse if I wasn't white, I can accept that
[2:10:22] Vaephera: I do find it funny how the anti-woke crowd has yet to notice Cindrethresh, who very deliberately has a female dracthyr and male visage form
[2:10:29] Saiyori: Chris Sayers has a twitter thread abt why he left blizzard, it's...a lot
[2:10:36] Deatheran: @TaliesinAndEvitel thats actualy exactly what white privilege is, the not knowing that being a different race / class would have affected the situation
[2:10:37] bottis96: No pirate news or did I miss it??
[2:10:40] neverbornlucky: Taliesin have you seen the youtube video of the girl telling the other older one that she isn't white she is peach then she calls the older girl STUPID
[2:10:42] Teth33: The worst part about these terms like "white privilege" or "woke" is that people look at them as having absolute definitions. They both have subjective definitions based on fundamental truths.
[2:10:44] markaud23: and even if *you* haven't, doesn't mean there can't be impacts at the level of society.
[2:10:56] khalcrux_gaming: Imagine being white and not being aware of what a woman or person of color has to deal with hence it does not exist. The problem itself.
[2:11:02] DozlaT: No pirate news, check the latest message on wowblog by holly longdalw @bottis96
[2:11:04] lukeKing96: I’m a gay white male and yes I have oppression for some aspects but me being white gives me certain privileges other people in my community don’t have. it’s not a bad thing to acknowledge that, don’t get why it’s so hard for people to get.
[2:11:06] Shanhayde: I'm being catcalled everytime when i go out because i have a different skin color and different hair (cause i'm not from here) so, i doubt most people live that, and that's not white people's fault, it's just happening
[2:11:09] DrGreatScott: Hearing families talk about how they have to warn their kids about cops is truly horrifying and sad
[2:11:14] DozlaT: @bottis96 they said it's March at least
[2:11:17] Shanhayde: Doesn't make white people baddies
[2:11:18] kiewies: In America you're more likely to be shot by the police if you're black or brown
[2:11:20] Osirisson: I grew up in a small town that was mainly white and mexican. When the only black family moved into our school district I SAW the Bullshite they endured in our school and neighboors. It is out there and is sad as hell.
[2:11:26] vlaovich88: There is no denying white privilege. Someone who is white can have struggles. But if you take a white person with everything else the same as a person of color and the person of color will have additional challenges.
[2:11:41] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I'm white and DIsability I don't count to them either
[2:11:44] Shanhayde: Oh @TaliesinAndEvitel i was just continuing on my previous messages haha
[2:11:48] Teth33: True story: I did a bad thing and was in court for it. Someone who did the exact same bad thing who happened to be a PoC got double the punishment. That's white privilege.
[2:12:29] Jeanie130: And "white privilege" doesn't mean your life wasn't difficult or hard. It just means you didn't have the extra obstacle of the color of your skin adding to all of life's events.
[2:12:35] Harai_Ulfsark: we also have research done on how poc receive less anesthetics during medical procedures that need them
[2:12:38] JMcGhee559: I understand why people get defensive about the idea of white privilege, especially people who have hard tough lives. It can feel like an accusation.  Once that happens it's really difficult to shift the discussion in a direction which can be informatie.
[2:12:51] neverbornlucky: Taliesin they hate the disabled and they hate women having choice with their  doctors about their health as well
[2:12:59] DragnosiOfNede: People need to be able to hold two thoughts in their head at once.  You can BOTH experience privilege for being white AND have a hard life growing up poor (for example).  Neither experience NEGATES the either.
[2:13:06] Discordant_Hats: People go "well I struggled so I don't have privilege" but that's not really the way it's meant. It's that *generally speaking* if placed in the same scenario, someone non-white/cis/heterosexual, what have you, would *potentially* face other troubles. Nobody is saying you're lucky if you're say, white and homeless, god no, simply that someone black being homeless has additional troubles on top, nobody is saying any of the scenario is remotely right.
[2:13:22] DozlaT: @harai_ulfsark yea, a lot of that is due to research not including poc. They've found in the US that poc went under diagnosed during covid since the pulse oximeters didn't read skin of color right
[2:13:26] mxfelwinter: tali...your country stabilished most racist apartheid states worldwide
[2:13:35] funviking99: exactly
[2:13:51] Nulgar: Cheer100 When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.
[2:14:08] DrGreatScott: There was a video I watched the other day about multiple men named James Bond. They all got pulled over by the cops. Only the black man was charged for obstructing an officer's duty for having that name.
[2:14:14] Alonarius: All my non-white friends who are doing well in theatre are pretty much anxious that they're only cast because of diversity quotas, not their own merit and THATS white privilege too
[2:14:24] KatieRet_: also, life is just fuckin hard. Everyone struggles, some just have it worse. No one said you aren't allowed to struggle just cause you're privileged
[2:14:25] grimblymcgoo: @mxfelwinter are you trying to get him with that comment?
[2:14:30] mxfelwinter: no
[2:14:33] Comrade_Ametrine: @mxfelwinter And that is relevant because?
[2:14:36] harddrive4: @TaliesinAndEvitel How do you suggest we solve these problems?
[2:14:42] lukeKing96: @mxfelwinter yes the UK did doesn’t mean we can’t acknowledge the other issues as well.
[2:14:45] holyzeke: I have healer privilege
[2:14:58] magecrimes: magecrimes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! All I know is I have subscriber and patreon privilege to Tali.
[2:15:02] funviking99: I never knew any privilege LUL
[2:15:19] HoodieDano: drop in to see Tali streaming for the first time in awhile and find he’s still out here fighting the good fight and trying to educate twitch chat. fight on tali
[2:15:29] witchhobbit: yup, my partner has gotten stopped before in stores because they are suspicious of him stealing. i have never been stopped in the store because i'm a white woman lol
[2:15:30] KatieRet_: Big reason it seems kinda icky when people say they're proud to be British
[2:15:38] adri_valeris: the video game industry (and tech) has made society extremely passive, immobile, conforming etc when it comes to social, political, and historical consciousness. you can see it in all gaming community. it has debilitated people to the point where they forgot how machist imperialism happened and who benefitted from it (continuously). almost pointless to discuss this in this industry
[2:15:39] aeson_of_raid_sock: I ate English food and I didn’t feel privileged
[2:15:45] Frosted2319: people just would rather ignore it than deal with it
[2:15:56] funviking99: @aeson_of_raid_sock hahaha
[2:15:57] fooxytv: really nice transmog
[2:16:00] Mundani: white males of lower class suffers from a lot of issues, but are being told that their problems come from the inclusion of minorities and the empowerment of women, while mostly it is due to an economy where low paid jobs and poor academic background has far less security and opportunity.
[2:16:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin disney turning red is woke cause its about a girls period
[2:16:15] Nickystr1x: white privilege is the privilege of not having to contend with nonwhite adversity, that's why white people have such a hard time perceiving it
[2:16:26] boomshroom: is all very easy to overlook for convenience. Tate modern gallery is the same Tate as Tate & Lyle sugar. Where did they make their money from originally we wonder
[2:16:44] knightjudicator: recognizing your privilege and standing with those without it is honestly the only thing most minorities expect. and its super easy to do...
[2:16:45] DrGreatScott: Also, if white privilege truly didn't exist, why would far right extremists promote the fearmongering narrative that white people are losing some insane cult belief in global genetic domination? There's an inherent fear in losing that power
[2:17:03] Efendal: there is a statistic from the 1800s which shows that the lower the cotton price was, the higher the number of lynchings got. there is something to conclude from that.
[2:17:07] funviking99: I am aware but not feel guilty for something I don’t have control over or haven’t done I know there is racism out there
[2:17:27] YayFiber: !podcast
[2:17:35] knightjudicator: @funviking99 you shouldnt feel guilty, you should feel angry the privilege exists
[2:17:58] harddrive4: @TaliesinAndEvitel Do you agree that in America atm there are non-white people that are born into privilege?
[2:18:08] TankenFunk: The easiest way I've heard it explained is for a white person growing up in a predominantly "white" country, no one will ever question their nationality, while for someone who is non-white, that does happen a lot. And from that assumptions, some people will treat you differently. It's not about guilt or shame, but it is something that should be recognised
[2:18:12] knightjudicator: Tali doesnt live here thats not a fair question
[2:18:15] DragnosiOfNede: I would say recognizing WHERE your privileged and where you're NOT and standing with those who would do like wise and sue for change, is all we can do.
[2:18:40] khalcrux_gaming: The answer to that question would be obvious
[2:18:50] Discordant_Hats: "Privilege" is seen as an end-all be-all, as though you either have it or you don't. But that's not true. I have some privilege in being white within the UK, I lack privilege because I'm trans and queer in the UK. It's different streams, the miscommunication stems from many people thinking that "privilege" is just this one singular item you own or don't.
[2:18:52] cassetto: @TaliesinAndEvitel if anything wow is not woke enough, it's corporate wokeness is a joke and an insult to the great people working there who have honest intentions. And there are tons.
[2:18:59] kiewies: It's called "Intersectionality" Jesus fudge & crust people 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
[2:19:13] TankenFunk: Straight*
[2:19:13] funviking99: you are right @taliesinandevitel
[2:19:16] TankenFunk: tneEvi
[2:19:17] Caladin_the_Paladin: And handsome, too boot.
[2:19:21] Necoc: also welsh though
[2:19:25] holyzeke: what about streamer privilege?
[2:19:30] cardrenn: you are a healer tho
[2:19:31] HolocronCoder: Tali's straight?!
[2:19:40] nokster: reroll another class
[2:19:44] birdsoundz: He kinda spittin frfr
[2:19:48] Osirisson: I am a Cis White Gay Male. I have privilege in that I am Male and White and Cis. I am oppressed being a gay person. It's not a one or the other
[2:19:53] valv4d0s: Class, Race, and Gender are all mechanisms of oppression which means you can have privilege in some of them and not others. Tali is right; this is intersectionality.
[2:20:04] Teth33: This isn't my first time here. You aren't 100% straight. I've heard you talk about Cavil.
[2:20:08] valv4d0s: We are speaking socially and these days often economically
[2:20:15] Mundani: Are we making a privelige tier list?
[2:20:17] witchhobbit: @Teth33 LUL
[2:20:19] funviking99: no that’s true, we being white don’t know what other skin coloured people dealt with
[2:20:20] DrGreatScott: The class system is inherently privileged. That doesn't mean race still isn't a factor in those realms. Plenty of american cops tend to care more about your color than your wealth.
[2:20:24] Shanhayde: i'll never have white privilege ?! i unfollow
[2:20:24] harddrive4: @TaliesinAndEvitel Ok, i agree. just getting clarification. It could at some point change and there could be a ton of oppression and/racism against white people. Do you agree?
[2:20:31] grimzero617: But Tali, isn't it also true that you are a "fuck mountain"?
[2:20:36] witchhobbit: yeah i seriously thought you were bi LUL
[2:20:42] Mundani: (joke btw). I get what you mean :D
[2:20:47] Rico_Azzarash: Shadowlands will be S privileged on that one xD
[2:20:49] valv4d0s: What a good time to tune in! Nerds rule
[2:20:57] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I'd vote for you if you could be President of the USA
[2:20:58] GingerBear30: Have a good one guys :D, i'm going to go chill, this convo is to intense for my day off lol.
[2:21:09] MrAxeffect: its how we make bads things seem less bad
[2:21:13] atamala: but tali, but tali!! What if aliens landed and they were racist against only white people!?!??!
[2:21:36] harddrive4: @TaliesinAndEvitel Its useful because we don't want to solve an evil with a evil.
[2:21:41] aeson_of_raid_sock: I love Commiesin streams
[2:21:47] Mosquithor: I mean racism against white people exists, its just not nearly as common as the others
[2:21:48] grimblymcgoo: Your brainrot is severe
[2:21:49] funviking99: racism  applies to all skin colours
[2:21:54] Efendal: @harddrive4 the status quo of power structures grew over the last 1000 years at least. i don't think we have to worry about stuff turning suddenly around
[2:21:58] TankenFunk: I usually go "Not relevant to what we're discussing" when hit with that tneEvi
[2:22:17] gronnlir: r
[2:22:20] fishermanmash: my fav subject!
[2:22:27] DrGreatScott: @harddrive4 That's part of the fearmongering that drives the ridiculous desire to maintain the status quo. It leads the notion that "yeah, white people in power are bad, but if anyone else will just take revenge! SO just stick with the old white guy" smh
[2:22:27] holyzeke: Talie you realize that your way smarter than the chat right?
[2:22:30] s7wede: Not in the west no
[2:22:34] hitchmeister59: There could be some value in recognizing things could flip, so that's why we should work to limit or remove it.
[2:22:42] valv4d0s: lmaooooo white people are a governing and primary race/class in america. How are they oppressed when they are the oppressors
[2:22:43] KatieRet_: it's just bad faith
[2:22:55] Frosted2319: @TaliesinAndEvitel i think some people feel like the "woke agenda" isn't about being inclusive and more about pushing a narrative. For example with the wow woke thing where they took out some achievement names or something.
[2:22:55] Necoc: there was but not anymore "Irish not welcome" that kind of thing
[2:22:58] whatdatmean: @holyzeke god so true lol
[2:23:06] mxfelwinter: as a mexican the only racism toward a white person i ever witness was more related to her being a woman than being white (stereotypes toward blonde women here on mexico)
[2:23:08] grimblymcgoo: @Necoc I didnt know irish were a race
[2:23:11] fishermanmash: they took our jobs!
[2:23:43] KatieRet_: and correcting them in small amounts if possible
[2:23:51] SphericFormula: 'Woke' becomes whatever a bigot wants to complain about
[2:24:12] Caladin_the_Paladin: @SphericFormula You hit the nail right on the head.
[2:24:18] elbardo_ts: I'm going to go with my guts feeling of "people who complain about all of these things are people with too much free time"
[2:24:20] Kunozah: @SphericFormula accurate
[2:24:26] valv4d0s: some of ya'll need to actually read instead of watching youtube FR
[2:24:39] valv4d0s: or both
[2:24:59] grimblymcgoo: @elbardo_ts I think its a bit more nefarious then that sadly
[2:24:59] atamala: as long as they dont touch argussy
[2:25:28] RosieSeren: @SphericFormula yup, that's exactly what it is
[2:25:28] wyfoooooo: @valv4d0s real talk I just realized how long I've gone not reading an actual physical book
[2:25:47] DrGreatScott: One extreme to another is bad. Pretending that it's the only inevitability to maintain the status quo is insane
[2:25:47] harddrive4: @TaliesinAndEvitel Besides raising awareness, what other good solutions are there to this problem?
[2:25:54] Yurimooo: being woke means admitting henry cavil is hot
[2:25:55] FifiBelle_: @valv4d0s Completely agree - reading some of the chat I dont think some people realise they are casually racist, even if its without their knowledge
[2:25:58] valv4d0s: @wyfoooooo lol it's a vibe but always a good thing to start doing! Exercise your brain and get your critical thought moving
[2:26:08] KyleS07: People that are against being woke are worried about losing their privilege.
[2:26:13] valv4d0s: @FifiBelle_  <3
[2:26:23] DrGreatScott: @KyleS07 Boom. Nailed it
[2:26:29] Frosted2319: oh it is dumb and i mean all injustices are inclusive in the woke culture. for the wow thing it is very dumb but i think is part of why ppl say wow is woke among other things, like having gay people and all that. im not saying its right just speculation.
[2:26:30] lukeKing96: @kyles07 so true
[2:26:31] wyfoooooo: no I mean I do read lol, it's just digital media, e-books, online news articles etc.
[2:26:50] CasualR: @TaliesinAndEvitel the other part of the definition of woke is "being aware of systems". Most anti-woke arguments seem to be made from the perspective of "I know a guy and..."
[2:27:02] cicerospqr: The other day i was watching your stream and for some reason my GF told me "is that the guy from Inside Man"? I was very confused, until she explained that she believed you where Davin Tennant... is she racist?
[2:27:06] aeson_of_raid_sock: right wingers generally don’t think systemically, only personally
[2:27:22] Toolak: If kids at school bullied for their race and school administration closes its eyes on that it becomes systemic?
[2:27:24] funviking99: I have dealt with racism because the country Im from and being called a gipsy, I know racism
[2:27:29] khalcrux_gaming: The fear here is recognizing other people exist and they have struggles because of who they are will eventually lead to being discriminated against which says a lot.
[2:27:30] HazMatt_Prime: I do miss when WoW got really dark and fucked up. I do feel like WoW is safer.
[2:27:32] grimblymcgoo: @aeson_of_raid_sock Its why some of their worst views will change when it personally affects them
[2:27:42] aeson_of_raid_sock: exactly
[2:27:55] saarkhastick: Tali is Charlie Cox!
[2:27:55] witchhobbit: LUL
[2:27:59] SirSheepalot: What a huge compliment
[2:28:00] Jeanie130: /clap
[2:28:02] Darkalex175: what a save
[2:28:03] sebnificant: Nice save
[2:28:07] Nerraw3: lol
[2:28:10] DrGreatScott: Cue Doofenshmirtz quote
[2:28:14] Osirisson: Man I would love a David Tenant and Tali sandwhich....of course I'm the meat.
[2:28:40] karioke19: pshaw! tali is better looking! evitel is known for having excellent taste
[2:28:47] magecrimes: How did we end up on the topic of woke? Got to stream late, I'm assuming someone in chat had uncharitable things to say about the Danuser news?
[2:29:07] ShadowDragon14855: morning all
[2:29:11] valv4d0s: lmaooo they called wow inclusive
[2:29:16] Jeanie130: I got it! It's Disney because some animals talk?
[2:29:17] valv4d0s: they just aren't smart enough to realize it
[2:29:18] Uppaluppa_: yes, nowdays white discrimination is systemic, havent you seen job quotas?, uni acceptance?, they are aiming for inclussion instead of capabilities
[2:29:19] elbardo_ts: do you think they know what they mean?
[2:29:26] aeson_of_raid_sock: the wow woke stream is basically a weekly show
[2:29:38] funviking99: disney because of the cartoony graphics?
[2:29:39] MisterDave: Morning Talie, I think you are a good bloke if I ever met one
[2:29:47] gloriouss619: I’m awake right. I have coffee
[2:29:53] grimblymcgoo: @Uppaluppa_ The purpose of those programs is to combat the systemic racism. How can you get this shit backwards?
[2:29:55] Tenga66: There's a rage bar in wow. Rage is an emotion.
[2:29:57] Syzmical: if it was tied with truely heroic stuff but those stakes havent been reached in DF unfort
[2:30:18] Rico_Azzarash: even "being tired" is actually an emotion
[2:30:20] Marach: @Uppaluppa_ dude leave the echo chamber already they're lying to you
[2:30:26] funviking99: LUL
[2:30:26] supercowsbrother: you're wrong, bloodlust is a buff
[2:30:27] HolocronCoder: Obv those "manly" emotions aren't actually EMOTIONS. We're talking "girly" emotions being woke and bad /s
[2:30:32] CeasiusPls: I've come to realize most people don't think the same as me when I say I want WoW to be darker
[2:30:36] Alarius_: i feel like wow and disney media are two vastly different sized platforms for influencing society
[2:30:37] JMcGhee559: @Rico_Azzarash my most common emotion these days
[2:30:40] mantooth11: What do you think of the premonition slot machine game play? New and interesting or absolutely terrible?
[2:30:48] holyzeke: let’s talk about those crap priest hero talents
[2:30:51] DragnosiOfNede: Woke is about understanding that your system of government was built by a specific sub class.  The further you are from that sub class, the less privilege you have.  Western society was built by rich, white, male, Christian, land owners.  The further away you are from that, the less your privilege.  Conversely many countries in the middle east were built by rich, non-white, male, muslim, land owners.
[2:30:51] Jeanie130: Hmm - increased pricing?
[2:30:53] SirSheepalot: Honestly the cartoony graphics is one of the things i really like about wow
[2:30:55] valv4d0s: @Uppaluppa_ Black and Brown people have been outlawed from higher education for over 100 years since colleges in America were founded. Diversity doesn't even touch the oppression that caused. Also NOTHING is without merit. You can't get into Harvard without the grades buddy
[2:30:56] lukeKing96: @uppaluppa_ correcting the lack of admission of other ethnicities is not an attack on white people at all. it’s lifting those who have been discriminated against to have the same opportunities.
[2:30:56] Necoc: @TaliesinAndEvitel I would love a Wow version of "Hellfire"
[2:30:58] aeson_of_raid_sock: I would love to see a Flynn Mathias kiss in game. we need some more love in game
[2:30:59] magecrimes: I dunno I wouldn't call Fast and Furious disneyfied. And that's full of emotion and family. So I tend to ignore anyone who makes the "wow is disney-fied" or "wow went woke" argument since it's rarely if ever in good faith.
[2:31:02] atamala: they had an agenda of disney-fication smh
[2:31:15] KatieRet_: I mean the first part of the fyrakk cinematic was very kingdom hearts lol
[2:31:23] databob1: I would love to see some more serious horror tropes in wow that would be fun
[2:31:27] elbardo_ts: feelPulpi feelPulpi feelPulpi feelPulpi feelPulpi feelPulpi feelPulpi feelPulpi feelPulpi
[2:31:28] funviking99: I love these emotional questlines
[2:31:29] grimzero617: On my server's trade chat this week, there was lengthy discussion of how its bullshit that nobody pays for mailbox dancing anymore. Yep. Woke af.
[2:31:37] atamala: @DragnosiOfNede saving this :)
[2:31:44] elbardo_ts: feelCraba tneEvi feelCrabc
[2:31:47] Teth33: The new stories are no different than old stories. Arthas and Jaina was a doomed romance. The difference is that if they did that story now they would give it a bit more of a human touch, rather than the "tragic love story" template it was given.
[2:31:50] KyleS07: I think there are a set of gamers that want WoW to be Warhammer Fantasy, and anything that isn't that,  is woke.
[2:32:04] witchhobbit: a lot of disney is dark actually, if you know your disney history
[2:32:04] elbardo_ts: feelCraba tneEviHeart feelCrabc
[2:32:05] aeson_of_raid_sock: horrific visions were kind of horror in game
[2:32:16] elbardo_ts: feelCraba tneAni feelCrabc
[2:32:18] Alarius_: i dont mind the woke stuff but i do miss the old days of fantasy just being fantasy
[2:32:24] s7wede: I think people get confused with too many emotions and badly written characters and their motivations / decisions
[2:32:36] elbardo_ts: feelCraba tneLore feelCrabc
[2:32:36] funviking99: it was good 😌
[2:32:40] elbardo_ts: evi with crab legs
[2:32:41] aeson_of_raid_sock: can we put the Disney where they hide dicks in the movies into wow?
[2:32:42] lukeKing96: I grew up with barely any representation in media. I’d having some now means being ‘woke’ so be it. it’s make my inner child so happy seeing it in games.
[2:32:48] Necoc: felt unearned to me but eh
[2:32:51] elbardo_ts: feelCraba tneLore feelCrabc
[2:32:52] chops6965: agreed
[2:32:59] databob1: Azeroth assemble was amazing
[2:33:09] valv4d0s: fantasy was always inclusive lmaoooo most fantasy fans were in the out crowds... the whole point is inclusion!
[2:33:11] Teth33: FANTASY HAS ALWAYS BEEN POLITICAL
[2:33:15] KatieRet_: the part where they start floating and their eyes start glowing, I don't mind it but that's the only disney sorta thing I've seeen
[2:33:18] SirSheepalot: Yeah the "old days" were just us being young i'm afraid
[2:33:20] Trebled_Mind: I need to hear Thrall yell “ Planeteers Assemble!” 😂
[2:33:22] kiewies: LMAO Tolkien was racist AF wym
[2:33:24] REDSUNDERGROUND: @Teth33 no
[2:33:25] valv4d0s: Fantasy is al ways representative
[2:33:28] funviking99: like when Grom died in warcraft 3 and Thrall was crying, isn’t that emotion? what’s wrong with people
[2:33:36] Darkalex175: LoTR has so many echoes of what he believed, both good and bad
[2:33:39] wyfoooooo: smh people can believe wizards shooting fireballs from their fingertips but not guys liking other guys
[2:33:48] grimblymcgoo: @REDSUNDERGROUND Yes. see how easy that was?
[2:33:54] Toiarc: JRR Tolken was historian so they pretty much reflected some things from real life and things of its time
[2:33:56] valv4d0s: exactly
[2:34:00] knightjudicator: Tolkien: lives through the first ever mechanized war LOTR: battle between natural harmony and filthy industry
[2:34:00] ArkyteCurse: Fantasy by it's very definition is woke. Fantasy is intentionally self aware about the societal injustices they weave into their narratives.
[2:34:02] valv4d0s: ya'll can't see the forest for the trees
[2:34:02] Animeinn: People want sweaty hairy guys fighting each other. I roll my eyes every time I hear someone say that. And that someone is you know who.
[2:34:08] kso128: LOTR was about JRR's obsession with english/celtic history and not getting over his war experiences
[2:34:10] DragnosiOfNede: By that definition, Star Wars was 5000 Shades of Woke.
[2:34:13] skeletonetiquette: People just miss a time when they didn't understand the messages coming across
[2:34:17] HazMatt_Prime: You know what throws me off? Why does any faction feel like they can beat the Horde and Alliance? After we defeated the Legion? After we defeated Nipple Death Guy?! If the Alliance and Horde show up, whoever we're fighting should be like 'nah dawg, I'm out, I quit.'
[2:34:26] Discordant_Hats: Media is just, very rarely, pandering a little to other people now, and you notice that and think it's a new thing. But in reality, that bias being towards *you* has been noticed by everyone else for years.
[2:34:31] hitchmeister59: Tolkien tried to argue that he didn't mean it as allegory.
[2:34:43] atamala: why he spent more time describing dinner than the battle of helms deep in the books
[2:34:44] PidiaP: PidiaP subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! I heard Tali made Danuser quit
[2:34:45] Alarius_: yes, but wow lore initially was never that parallel
[2:34:45] aeson_of_raid_sock: he was also a big environmentalist
[2:34:48] kso128: i do actually enjoy there being women in fantasy now, call that woke if you want :P
[2:34:56] TankenFunk: lotr is woke because Frodo experiences emotions, it is known
[2:35:05] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel I think they just don't want story.
[2:35:17] KatieRet_: It's gonna be very hard for any  author to argue they didn't put any of their personal real life experience into their writing, even if they deny it
[2:35:22] KhrysW: @hazmatt_prime Ahaha thank you for the laugh
[2:35:26] funviking99: can we agree he was just the greatest human ever?
[2:35:36] Nulgar: Kafka's Metamorphosis was obviously just about a guy turning into a bug, no emotions there
[2:35:37] valv4d0s: @KatieRet_ facts!
[2:35:43] ArkyteCurse: Aslan in Narnia being God is another example of fantasy using real life to create the narrative
[2:35:55] Tenga66: @TankenFunk hasChud Men fighting over a ring? Woke.
[2:36:07] elbardo_ts: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:36:10] kso128: he wasnt _that_ bad for his time, at least
[2:36:11] HazMatt_Prime: @khrysw lol thanks, I try. Still, I hope Tali senpai notices me
[2:36:15] funviking99: yeah that, but we all have defects LUL
[2:36:28] saarkhastick: @ArkyteCurse How is a lion being god using real life?
[2:36:29] databob1: @elbardo_ts DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:36:30] cabeshpash: racist
[2:36:37] HolocronCoder: That inherent charisma score bonus, I see, I see
[2:36:37] cabeshpash: LUL LUL LUL
[2:36:37] KatieRet_: He was distraught seeing the industrialisation of the place he lived and seeing the nature destroyed, he hated war and machinery because of his experience in ww1, hence Saruman's whole arc
[2:36:38] khalcrux_gaming: Master Racey?
[2:36:41] Nulgar: yeah, LotR focusing on returning a King to his throne tainted so many future Fantasy stories
[2:36:47] john_fury_: The Alliance believes in the Divine right of monarchy…
[2:36:49] kso128: modern fantasy still has the problem of 'chosen ones'
[2:37:02] TankenFunk: @Tenga66 The way Sam and Frodo shared their brotherly, friendly love together is so woke. They would never do that in the 1890s smh
[2:37:04] Mosquithor: I mean and orc being invaders and looking like disformed humans, or elves
[2:37:14] TheZofren: sometimes I feel a little soft when I feel bad for killing "made to be villains" enemies in fantasy games, like the djaradin. kinda comforting to hear tolkien said that about the orks
[2:37:16] aeson_of_raid_sock: he was also only supposed to procreate with Arwen to inject elven blood back in. which is ick
[2:37:17] alextheblight: @kso128 where's Illidan when you need him
[2:37:33] Tenga66: @Tenga66 dsaNODDERS
[2:37:36] vituperated: Numenor = the UK. Destroyed by the corrupted leader. Anti-monarchy? let's push that narrative
[2:37:39] ArkyteCurse: @saarkhastick Aslan is a representation the the christian God. CS Lewis was very religious. he made a fantasy world based on Christianity. whether or not god is actually real is a whole different convo
[2:37:42] patryk_sturm: But numenor was his prime example of the colonial Power being punished.
[2:38:14] Nulgar: "the worst kind of people"
[2:38:15] Mosquithor: Arent orcs just messed up elves?
[2:38:45] Rico_Azzarash: No! I forbid you kill orcs! I am one of them!
[2:38:48] ka_gu_ra: Sorry for offtop. But because of you. Preach and Grinding Gears I've recently started playing FF14 and... I can't stop. Thank you!
[2:38:51] Nulgar: @Mosquithor not an expert, but I think they were humans
[2:39:05] JMcGhee559: I think this points back to the media illiteracy point someone made earlier (sorry forgot who). Meaning that if you don't know what JRR's beliefs or politics are it's easy to miss all the real world parallels
[2:39:12] aeson_of_raid_sock: as accolon said, art imitates life
[2:39:21] saarkhastick: @ArkyteCurse Gotcha, I interpreted the statement as saying god was the real life being used, not that a christian god is a real life thing.
[2:39:29] Rico_Azzarash: #ad
[2:39:30] Efendal: So killing orcs is kinda ableist?
[2:39:32] khalcrux_gaming: Narrative? You mean agenda?
[2:39:42] Nulgar: @khalcrux_gaming tneTali
[2:40:00] holyzeke: next podcast guest…Accolon
[2:40:10] Nulgar: don't you know facts are subjective?
[2:40:14] Tenga66: "RATM has gone woke and political!"
[2:40:14] JMcGhee559: oh for sure, i was trying to connect it back to the  "fantasy as fantasy" point. But yea, totally wrong
[2:40:21] sebnificant: Being bad at understanding art doesn't change the actual artwork LUL
[2:40:25] MrAxeffect: MrAxeffect subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[2:40:30] khalcrux_gaming: "Morty you wanna get in on this? We're totally justified slaughtering these orcs cause they have no souls now."
[2:40:32] Mosquithor: He had to be inspired by something, it doesnt necesserily mean he wanted to push certain narrative, but also maybe he was
[2:40:47] valv4d0s: its not rude. you are doing them a service even if they don't realize it Tali
[2:41:03] PidiaP: Wait, you mean people make art that reflects their realities!?! tneKhadgarWut
[2:41:15] mydemoncat: is there a list of like all relevant fantasies since like 1800?
[2:41:23] databob1: I would like to see the magical girl out fit get the cloak color treatment
[2:41:39] JMcGhee559: In my professional life, I have to spend a lot of time context setting in the presentations I give, that's bled into my personal life and i am over sensitive to trying to set context whenever i chat with friends even
[2:41:43] ArkyteCurse: it's like the goons that say Star Trek suddenly went woke
[2:41:49] bellzzar1: gets to a point we can't enable peoples ignorance or stupidity towards such cubjects
[2:41:51] SphericFormula: Lads, i'm debating splashing out on an OLED tv, should i
[2:41:58] Osirisson: To be fair Tali that's ALL art. a reflection of the cutural and political state at the time.
[2:42:05] bellzzar1: subjects*
[2:42:19] TankenFunk: Also, to the repeating point of pushing a narrative/agenda, most authors don't sit down and pick out three or four political stances to write their story about. They reflect their lives and experiences, and their opinions on the matter. Sometimes it's a conscious decision, sometimes not
[2:42:25] JMcGhee559: "I wont listen to rage against the machine anymore, cuz they've gone woke" genre is my favorite social media sub-genre
[2:42:30] mxfelwinter: clearly most people didnt get it, because we live in a dystopian cyberpunk world...but with very boring corporate aesthetics
[2:42:33] sebnificant: One could even argue that mainstream art these days is less political as there are far more lobbyying and interference in art. For example, making games with real life weaponry will have clauses like "only good guys get to use this model of a gun" in the licensing contracts
[2:42:35] random_redshirt: Exactly.  Fantasy and SciFi can address all sorts of social issues and explore them *because* they aren't bound by real life circumstances.
[2:42:39] Jeanie130: willfully ignorant
[2:42:48] malice101: very fair lol
[2:43:02] LGashly: to a certain level you can't have a discussion about media literacy with someone who isn't media literate
[2:43:17] aeson_of_raid_sock: I mean Star Trek was kind of an ideal during the civil rights movement
[2:43:22] TankenFunk: Ah yes, the ever apolitical sci-fi story of "Earth is dead because we killed it, time for space lol" being apolitical
[2:43:25] ArkyteCurse: @jmcghee559 it's like the people that were using American Idiot as a trump theme song
[2:43:27] PidiaP: We live in a time where certain people value their ignorance equal to someone’s expertise
[2:43:41] CeasiusPls: personally my worry isn't that there's politics in fantasy, it's that current world politics may make it boring
[2:43:43] JMcGhee559: @ArkyteCurse yeah, i love that shit, really gets me chuckling
[2:43:55] valv4d0s: or how some people think Star Trek isn’t socialist as fuck lol
[2:44:03] Efendal: One of the first sci-fi-stories was written by Johannes Kepler. It is about people living on the moon and about their night sky. Basically it was keplers argument against geocentrism which he couldnt publish as a scientific work
[2:44:14] atamala: a lot of today's problems are because people have a personal, all human knowledge accessible device in their pocket and so many people lack critical thinking skills to cope with it
[2:44:28] Mosquithor: You are being inspired by events, not copying it 1 for 1
[2:44:33] ArkyteCurse: But when other fantasy was written it was "current world politics" because it's what was going on at that time
[2:44:37] DragnosiOfNede: @atamala Here Here!
[2:44:38] Tenga66: "Allegory of the mancave"
[2:44:43] KyleS07: Also Star Trek pioneered wokeism in scifi.
[2:44:46] witchhobbit: very true
[2:44:58] valv4d0s: @atamala facts
[2:44:59] JMcGhee559: sorry tali, there was no fantasy before the LOTR Movies, obviously /s
[2:45:13] ArkyteCurse: @kyles07 according to some people star trek just recently went woke lol
[2:45:45] SouvlakiTheBest: Hellscream talking about honor while killing the dude in stonetalon = peak WoW. Dragons talking about family = bottom WoW. Simple as that.
[2:46:04] kiewies: Also the only non-white people in LOTR are the orcs......
[2:46:08] ka_gu_ra: Uruk Heis tho =)
[2:46:23] thunduz: never trading the books how are the orcs made?
[2:46:27] thunduz: reading*
[2:46:27] schlakt: i thought Sam called frodo ”master frodo” in the movies or am i misremembering?
[2:46:28] HazMatt_Prime: But WHY are all Djaradin bad?
[2:46:31] valv4d0s: good Ted talk lmao
[2:46:39] KyleS07: I know I find that hilarious!
[2:46:40] atamala: @kiewies easterlings? the savage dunedain of the north??
[2:46:47] ArkyteCurse: @souvlakithebest that's just your opinion though. you're allowed to have it but not allowed to say others people's opinions aren't valid because you have yours
[2:47:03] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel agreed
[2:47:10] Rico_Azzarash: Shadowlands is a peak wow! What are you talking about!!
[2:47:12] KyleS07: @ArkyteCurse I know I find that hilarious!
[2:47:13] shabobado: the only difference is contemporary sci-fi/fantasy reflects contemporary commentary and thus has a tendency to make people uncomfortable for people who just wanted to “escape”
[2:47:13] atamala: @atamala dunelendings** rather. what the dunedains fell into I think after corruption
[2:47:14] Drageras: @kiewies that's not true, there are people of multiple races in Saurons army, they are from the other countries that he had already conquered
[2:47:21] TankenFunk: Cherry-picked example off something I like = peak wow. Bottom of the barrel, stupidest thing I don't like = bottom wow, but unironically
[2:47:35] CeasiusPls: As an example, Game of Thrones is anti war, but I wouldn't want it to be so blatantly anti war that nothing happens. I want my WoW goblins to be greedy fucks, I don't want them to start worker co-ops. My examples are extreme hypothetical but it s just there to prove a point
[2:47:37] PidiaP: How much longer does Danuser need to be gone so we can call his writing peak WoW?
[2:47:43] KatieRet_: edge for edge's sake is much worse than 'woke' for 'woke's' sake lol
[2:47:58] JMcGhee559: @shabobado this is a good point, most of the themes of older sci-fi/fantasy have been synthesized into current current society somehow
[2:48:09] witchhobbit: @kiewies i think that is the movie adaptations' fault. which is very typical of hollywood
[2:48:17] TankenFunk: @PidiaP 3 years, 9 months and 28 days
[2:48:26] Tenga66: Blue dragonflight questlines in DF = peak wow, Blue dragonflight questlines in WOTLK = bottom wow
[2:48:26] databob1: it's like a bad comidian: can't make them laugh i'll just piss them off or shock them
[2:48:29] valv4d0s: no don’t tell me lalalalalalalala
[2:48:39] mydemoncat: @Tenga66 damn real shit
[2:48:40] witchhobbit: game of thrones is anti war?
[2:48:41] atamala: number of days withotu thinking about the roman empire: 0   Thanks tali
[2:48:59] CeasiusPls: I'm fine with them overcoming the bad shit. I think Arcane is a good example of how Class struggle is portrayed
[2:49:00] kso128: Foundation series are making quite a good show out of an empire falling (even though it strays from the novels)
[2:49:07] Eregbueye: well wouldn't you want to have the good parts in a game tho
[2:49:10] shabobado: a Roman Empire that doesn’t fall would ironically be boring
[2:49:12] KatieRet_: i mean wow could afford to just do cool stuff all the time but the story would be lame
[2:49:14] Darkalex175: barbarian senators...in my senate? /s
[2:49:16] Drageras: But it took hundreds of years for society to get from feudalism and an industrial revolution to get to capitalism. WoW is just speedrunning everything
[2:49:17] witchhobbit: nvm nvm lol
[2:49:28] ArkyteCurse: @haleych the through line, especially in the books, is how war destroys everyone and everything and how much better the world would be without it
[2:50:02] Nulgar: Star Trek TOS was SO woke in its days
[2:50:13] Drageras: Yes there is stuff like the freemason's guild
[2:50:13] ArkyteCurse: I don't know if 20 years would be considered speed running
[2:50:14] atamala: hell jesus preached and early christians were communal
[2:50:14] CeasiusPls: Are you still talking to me or someone else?
[2:50:23] CeasiusPls: cause that wasnt my argument
[2:50:24] Dreclador: Stone Mason's Guild
[2:50:35] purpformance: If we are just throwing stuff out there
[2:50:37] purpformance: Free Palestine
[2:50:42] TankenFunk: @CeasiusPls Someone else
[2:50:44] KatieRet_: wow's story stretches so long
[2:50:45] databob1: what worker co-op I just though Gazlowe was treating people better
[2:50:48] getswolljones: getswolljones subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[2:50:50] CeasiusPls: no that was someone else, literally
[2:50:54] KatieRet_: 10000 year flashbacks too lol
[2:50:58] PidiaP: 30 if you include the RTS’a
[2:51:01] schlakt: i think you are mixing up two persons
[2:51:10] Toolak: Nah first Warcraft game is like 1992?
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 is gifting 10 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 628 in the channel! 
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to DimTim81! 
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to fabledthoughts! 
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to knightjudicator!

[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to daanielzzz! 
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Borgaash! 
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to elliongrey! 
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to lormarions! 
[2:51:11] karioke19: karioke19 gifted a Tier 1 sub to elPEX! 
[2:51:14] cardrenn: Tali, my man, you're such a patient guy with some "arguments"
[2:51:22] Efendal: Gazlowes monthly Pizza party should be enough for the workers
[2:51:25] Drageras: I'm just saying its unrealistic for xenophobic wartorn orcs to become instantly loving caring individuals in 1 generation
[2:51:28] LGashly: tali did you know that it actually wasn't me that said that? /s
[2:51:29] Nulgar: @Drageras it's Steampunk anyway, it doesn't need to follow real-life societal evolution - not to mention that Democracy existed in the real world 2000 years ago
[2:51:35] Drageras: But I guess all of fantasy is unrealistic
[2:51:44] TankenFunk: Can't believe the Silmarillion would just sum up tens of thousands of years into a single book
[2:51:47] CeasiusPls: look I was the one who made the original point about goblin worker co-ops, not the speed run, just to clarify. I'm fine with them overcoming the bad shit. I think Arcane is a good example of how Class struggle is portrayed
[2:51:49] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras Good think theres several generations that have passed since their corruption??????
[2:51:49] FelPlague: Retail? Don't you know SoD phase 2 is out? Get with the times old man. felplaBoof
[2:51:50] KatieRet_: LUL
[2:51:54] SirSheepalot: I mean we did have that 7 year time skip
[2:52:13] Discordant_Hats: Labour went from Corbyn to Starmer in less than 10.
[2:52:18] hitchmeister59: We coulld have fought the American Civil War more than three times over in the time WoW has been around.
[2:52:23] derekdoesmusic: Please remember the most important take away: You look very handsome today
[2:52:31] karioke19: tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes
[2:52:36] mxfelwinter: are they aware that the conditions that ended up topling many monarchies happened as a consequence of WW1...and WoW had like 4 wars on that scale?
[2:52:41] Drageras: I meant the mentality of the people, less about the systems
[2:52:52] ArkyteCurse: But not all orcs are like that. like not all night elves love the forest. not all goblins are greedy. it's a society and there's different people in it
[2:52:57] aeson_of_raid_sock: people who don’t like or can’t deal with change play classic
[2:53:04] Drageras: Like slave owners were still racist right after the civil war
[2:53:06] grimblymcgoo: @aeson_of_raid_sock lol
[2:53:14] Discordant_Hats: Imagine arguing that Anduin should still have that weird child model, it all sounds like that to me haha
[2:53:22] TankenFunk: @Drageras I'm sure at least one person changed their mind
[2:53:24] karioke19: i hope evitel had an amazing bday tneWineTime tneWineTime
[2:53:26] delirious152007: I graduated high school, collage, and have been through 3 different jobs in the span of wow life :P
[2:53:29] valv4d0s: TBH when Bellular took the clickbait to say wow isn't "gritty enough" from weirdos online just proliferated this garbage take some wow players have
[2:53:32] Bibs0001: what a convo to join in on, lmao hey
[2:53:35] SirSheepalot: it's litterally changing in pace with the mentality of the people writing the stories so you know
[2:53:38] SirSheepalot: if anything
[2:53:42] bellzzar1: just look at how a 20 year period in history has rapidly changed say from 80's to the 2000
[2:53:42] futureforgotten: @Drageras but the orcs werent initially xenophobic. They were manipulated and had demon interventions, that wasnt their nature right?
[2:53:44] sebnificant: Holy crap who's the same person as 20 years ago? HOPEFULLY we all grow
[2:53:49] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras It was so not acceptable to be racist that there were federal troops stationed there to prevent it
[2:53:50] Dreclador: Isn't that the whole story of Greymane too? Like he's struggling witht he new world view
[2:54:14] valv4d0s: cooking
[2:54:46] Caladin_the_Paladin: I think that's the crux of the problem these types of people have with this whole thing: they don't like the changes irl, so they don't want them reflected in the game.
[2:55:08] valv4d0s: truer
[2:55:11] khalcrux_gaming: huh?
[2:55:20] Drageras: @futureforgotten I don't think they were just kind peaceful people. They still killed draenei on draenor
[2:55:21] Tenga66: I've yet to meet someone who hasn't changed in 20 years.
[2:55:44] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras The alternate timeline you mean?
[2:55:47] KatieRet_: Ah but wow has a selfie cam
[2:55:48] aeson_of_raid_sock: we still have flip phones
[2:55:51] atamala: lol mywindows 95 with 400 mb ram
[2:55:57] karioke19: ive created and raised whole people since vanilla
[2:55:59] Caladin_the_Paladin: @Tenga66 Count yourself lucky. I know a lot of people who are dead-set against changing. It's frustrating as hell to deal with them.
[2:56:09] grin1ing: @TaliesinAndEvitel Do you think, killing off Genn would be better or just lazy?
[2:56:09] HazMatt_Prime: Idk....WoW has spaceships
[2:56:11] khalcrux_gaming: The moment I could watch Youtube on my phone I was floored.
[2:56:12] harruq: i've always had this theory that worlds that have magic, simply don't advance quickly technologilly
[2:56:19] Drageras: @grimblymcgoo yes but it was basically an exact replica timeline until Garrosh saved his dad
[2:56:22] atamala: @Caladin_the_Paladin "we've always done it this way" is a tough thing to break down
[2:56:30] Caladin_the_Paladin: @atamala Indeed.
[2:56:31] Dreclador: I think what people are struggling with is that the 'woke' or more emotional stuff feels fake because so little story telling really happens in WoW.
[2:56:36] Discordant_Hats: And a direct reflection of *Blizzard* changing at that.
[2:56:38] futureforgotten: @Drageras @grimblymcgoo In the main universe they didnt go to war with the Dranaei until Nerzhul (with influence from kil'jaeden) started it though right?
[2:56:47] bellzzar1: i like to use the example of seeing pc's in 90's movies and think my mobile phone has more power and all the pc's in that room
[2:56:50] Dreclador: For instance we have barely seen Chromie and Nosdormu's relationship for most of the game, so watching them hug feels forced
[2:57:07] Dennin0599: Steamvil
[2:57:46] Syzmical: wc3 had enough story to carry the wow xpacs till engeneral ideas ran dry it seems
[2:57:56] elbardo_ts: maybe the game wasn't the thing that changed. Maybe the player changed.
[2:58:02] Drageras: @futureforgotten I'm not sure
[2:58:16] valv4d0s: cata was the start of the good story then mists leveled it up and so on
[2:58:16] random_redshirt: Having high-level magic in the Warcraft universe would change how technology develops, which explains some of the mashed-up aesthetic.  Also, multiple races of aliens bringing in their own tech.
[2:58:23] Drageras: All I can say for sure was Legion was the best expansion in nearly every way despite high level players not enjoying it
[2:58:23] atamala: hey guys, is a hug woke?
[2:58:24] SirSheepalot: what?
[2:58:24] CeasiusPls: It's a lot less dark, barring the stuff that's not socially acceptible now. Arcane is 'woke'/inclusive but the story is much darker
[2:58:25] valv4d0s: they are getting into some of their best story direction and art design ever tbh
[2:58:34] thornn45: Is hugging woke?
[2:58:35] KhrysW: I loved everything with Chromie
[2:58:42] elbardo_ts: with all due respect: ???????????????
[2:58:46] futureforgotten: woke is when hug
[2:58:51] SouvlakiTheBest: idk it feels like they make all the races having the same values and ideas, like they are all the same thing
[2:59:02] grin1ing: @TaliesinAndEvitel because we weren't shown their relationship in the same media (cinematics) before
[2:59:04] databob1: forced WTF???
[2:59:05] valv4d0s: closet racism lol
[2:59:08] XmeezyNV: whets your pc's specs? just curious :)
[2:59:10] aeson_of_raid_sock: positive emotion = woke
[2:59:13] elbardo_ts: i need an emote with a hand doing the italian gesture
[2:59:19] JMcGhee559: I'd hug my pizza delivery guy if he wouldn't punch me or something
[2:59:24] Dreclador: Ya, I think, you make really good points. It comes down to the fact that people are more uncomfortable with intimacy in their video games over violence.
[2:59:25] schlakt: some people are just grasping lol
[2:59:30] bettys_dungeon_adventures: hugging and empathy is woke man
[2:59:32] bellzzar1: we don't need to see every single character's whole life for something to happen, just so it doesn't feel forced
[2:59:33] Calli_C: What did I walk into?
[2:59:37] skeletonetiquette: Chromie like worships Nozdormu lol the fuck
[2:59:40] PAZek_: THEY ARE TIME DRAGONS!
[2:59:40] vlaovich88: I hug people I just met?
[2:59:41] elbardo_ts: the commentator is the wierd part
[2:59:44] SirSheepalot: Wait so it's forced that they hug because they haven't hugged before?
[2:59:45] Drageras: @taliesinandevitel I feel like WoW can't develop characters properly and it takes wayyy too long to tell their stories as well. Like the most popular and coolest characters of Illidan and Arthas are from WC3, which you got their whole storylines immediately through their campaigns
[2:59:48] valv4d0s: because they don't see them as human
[2:59:50] TankenFunk: Yeah it's not really "old thing" vs "new thing," it's Blizz choosing to portray and deliver the story in a way they haven't before.
[2:59:51] grimblymcgoo: Hugs are weak i guess? i dunno
[3:00:00] Waxx90: it's 2024 and hugging is woke now :(
[3:00:00] markaud23: someone needs to hug that commenter
[3:00:06] atamala: now lets talk about the forced kissing between tyrande and malfurion. I have done a lot, and I mean A LOT, of thinking about that scene
[3:00:16] Discordant_Hats: If someone new tuned into stream and saw Tali/Evi hug, you wouldn't react with confusion because you've not seen their relationship develop, they're married! It's a similar deal.
[3:00:16] aeson_of_raid_sock: we went through a whole mega dungeon with chromie to save him. the least we could get is a hug
[3:00:19] SouvlakiTheBest: problem is that they are huging in a game called world of warcraft
[3:00:31] LGashly: uwu
[3:00:32] BunnehKat: did any of the wow novels have hugs? when the story 'was only told in books, not in game'
[3:00:39] Nulgar: @Dreclador Nozdormu is societally and maybe literally the father figure,  did you never hug your dad?
[3:00:41] Darkalex175: all the work i did for wrathion should have given me  a hug lol
[3:00:42] Lektyr_11: Everyone after a football game hugs. Are football players weak?
[3:00:44] Arlaeya: we don't spend every second of their millennia-long lives in their company. to say they never hugged ever... is....
[3:00:45] elbardo_ts: ????????
[3:00:50] grimblymcgoo: @SouvlakiTheBest THere a fucking love stories throughout all of vanilla
[3:00:52] Drageras: Was a huge disappointment that Murozond wasn't the final boss of this expac
[3:00:53] atamala: zug zug only war!
[3:00:54] Thoreya: are u not able to hug once in a 20 year game icant
[3:00:54] jilbark: ????
[3:00:57] LGashly: HOW DARE PEOPLE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS >.> /s
[3:00:58] Saevash: is it a problem if people hug in star wars?
[3:00:59] TankenFunk: More like Woke of Wokecraft amirite?
[3:01:01] futureforgotten: they should hug in a warlike way duh
[3:01:02] aeson_of_raid_sock: world of HUGCRAFT
[3:01:10] Shanhayde: @BunnehKat most of the novels are litterally more focused on the relationships of the characters
[3:01:12] ArkyteCurse: there are wars going on in the real world right now and people are probably still hugging
[3:01:13] Nerraw3: That's why the achieve "Make love not warcraft" exists.  Hugs happen all the time
[3:01:13] delirious152007: only tuned in a few mins ago, but the story of wow (retail) has been great, maybe its because I'm older now, but I don't remember having such a emotional rollercoaster in other expansions' main quests.
[3:01:14] Waxx90: not in my world >:(
[3:01:16] karioke19: @Darkalex175 right?? why are WE getting the HUGS??
[3:01:17] Tenga66: "Varian caring about Anduin is so out of place in World of WARCRAFT"
[3:01:19] markaud23: I hate it when my war movies show the soldiers hugging or expressing emotions to each other.
[3:01:21] KatieRet_: this is so ridiculous hahahaha
[3:01:23] BroDog4: hug has been in the game forever......... hugging has always been there
[3:01:25] Saevash: like it's not like star wars is all about warfare
[3:01:25] PAZek_: WARcraft They should hug each other with SWORDS
[3:01:27] Nulgar: Corgo100 World of Warcraft means that everyone must be fighting everyone else, including relatives which may or may not be your literal father
[3:01:27] schlakt: people hug in Lotr too lol
[3:01:28] karioke19: *arent
[3:01:29] cardrenn: I am waiting for the CRAFT part, give me player housing
[3:01:29] HazMatt_Prime: I wish my character got a hug. Saving Azeroth is a thankless job.
[3:01:32] Dreclador: Y, I think, you make really good points. It comes down to the fact that people are more uncomfortable with intimacy in their video games over violence.
[3:01:33] valv4d0s: lmao go outside
[3:01:34] aeson_of_raid_sock: I WANT A HUG
[3:01:35] Drageras: I don't think people would care about the hug if it was balanced out by more badass cutscenes @taliesinandevitel
[3:01:35] Arlaeya: pretty sure........many soliders were hugged when they returned from war....?
[3:01:36] LilyOfTremere: Sounds like someone needs one :D
[3:01:36] wyfoooooo: if anything they'd hug MORE during war
[3:01:36] SirSheepalot: I'd argue the darker moments hit harder if there are lighter moments to contrast
[3:01:36] random_redshirt: No they don't, Tali.  Warcraft humans reproduce by budding, don't you know.
[3:01:38] BunnehKat: there's emotions during war time? omg
[3:01:41] BroDog4: well, / hug has been in the game forever......... hugging has always been there
[3:01:43] atamala: when I deployed I to iraq we hugged each other, especially after some spotty shit
[3:01:45] tom_badil_: do we give dumb ppl to much attention again? let them blabber in their echo chamber.
[3:01:46] KhrysW: I'd hate to see a world with no hugs
[3:01:56] Discordant_Hats: Seems a bit unrealistic that a bunch of soldiers played football together at Christmas-time. /s
[3:01:56] FatCatDad48: As Pat Benatar says, "Love is a battlefield"
[3:01:56] KatieRet_: chatter needs a hug
[3:02:03] JMcGhee559: oooh highlander?!
[3:02:04] atamala: war done? we need another war
[3:02:05] LGashly: STAB! :D
[3:02:08] Nulgar: celebratory genocide
[3:02:11] Tenga66: No loving your children in World of WARcraft, only corporal punishment.
[3:02:16] LGashly: god i love dagger fighting :3
[3:02:19] valv4d0s: chatter; get up now; its your duty to tell your mother; i NEED a hug!
[3:02:20] SouvlakiTheBest: im not saying it doesnt happen, im saying it shouldn't be highlighted
[3:02:23] elbardo_ts: OMG TALI THIS WW1 MOVIE IS SO UNREALISTING THEY STOPPED KILLING EACH OTHER DURING CHRISTMAS HOW UNREALISTIC IS IT THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
[3:02:24] Bonussize: hug and cry, hard to get that snot off the uniform
[3:02:25] holyzeke: what about thrall and Anduin being bffs now?
[3:02:28] elbardo_ts: yes caps were necesary
[3:02:33] HolocronCoder: Ultimate War - WH40K orcs?
[3:02:34] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras Balance out the singular hug in the cutscenes ever with all the other stuff?
[3:02:38] schlakt: @souvlakithebest why?
[3:02:41] theGLprime: so basically  if i google soldiers hugging i wont find any?
[3:02:46] Nerraw3: Our medic in Hell Lets Loose rezzes people and then knifes them at least once per fight
[3:02:50] markaud23: @SouvlakiTheBest it absolutely *should* be shown to highlight the importance of the event
[3:02:51] Nulgar: they are LITERALLY family
[3:02:57] hitchmeister59: Like the sailor kissing the nurse in time square on V-J day. What does that have to do with war?
[3:03:01] PandaliciousGaming: PandaliciousGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! oh im late! Hope you're having a great day :3
[3:03:05] grimblymcgoo: @grimblymcgoo So you want MORE hugs? IM IN
[3:03:22] Shanhayde: @SouvlakiTheBest why shouldn't it be ? what's the problem with a hug ?
[3:03:23] grin1ing: @TaliesinAndEvitel personally, it's the dialogue in that cinematic that makes it weird and uncomfortable, not the hug really
[3:03:33] Drageras: @grimblymcgoo look at it from an expansion perspective
[3:03:36] elbardo_ts: I'm not the streamer so i can say what i want. Andá a freir churros @SouvlakiTheBest
[3:03:39] karioke19: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco
[3:03:48] Tenga66: Fellas, have you seen the FORCED shapeshifting when a mage polymorphs you???
[3:03:54] TankenFunk: @elbardo_ts Yes it's so unrealistic, cause back in the day, MEN loved going to war and shooting each other Kappa
[3:03:57] ArkyteCurse: and isn't there like a whole ass storyline long before the dungeon where the entire plot is how chromie really cares about nosdormu and will never stop searching until she saves him? pretty sure there was
[3:04:00] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras I dont want to look at a singular thing from your perspective, thanks though
[3:04:05] bellzzar1: it was never meant to be and end of the world event and i like that
[3:04:23] elbardo_ts: @TankenFunk they even showed them exchanging gifts! wtf?!
[3:04:27] Drageras: @taliesinandevitel I don't even think there needs to be world breaking threats. But we didn't even have fyrakk do cool stuff in cutscenes. Imagine if he broke Alexstraza arm, or killed ANYONE in front of us.
[3:04:28] valv4d0s: CATA
[3:04:30] valv4d0s: lets gooo
[3:04:35] elPEX: @karioke19 TYSM for the gifted sub!
[3:04:41] Syzmical: i felt Gh'uun was one of the best and most threatening feeling first bosses of a xpac ever
[3:05:00] ka_gu_ra: Isn't DF a build-up for a trilogy
[3:05:13] grin1ing: but fyrakk is a world-ending threat
[3:05:14] KatieRet_: I think the sense of localised danger is the best in a long time, seeing Fyrakk in the world is fantastic for a start
[3:05:16] Drageras: I mean Fyrakk still had a world ending threat
[3:05:24] JMcGhee559: that is a problem any long running world has, you see it in comics and video games and other media as well.  e.g. what the hell do you do after the heroes beat thanos
[3:05:24] SouvlakiTheBest: chill meant killing bandits instead of gods not this
[3:05:29] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras You mean like the fight between Alexstraza and Razageth where she got injured and fell from the sky?
[3:05:36] HazMatt_Prime: Can you possibly imagine the trauma our characters have gone through? All the wars, all the thousands you've killed, all the raids...My Demon Hunter was imprisoned and immediately put back into service. Point is...I NEED a hug.
[3:05:37] TankenFunk: @Drageras When did anyone break anyone's arm in warcraft cinematics?
[3:05:41] ArkyteCurse: dragonflight was always intended to be the reintroduction to azeroth. I think ion even said at much as one point
[3:05:53] databob1: I'm never joining anyone in this chat for a war I don;t want to get stabbed
[3:05:54] Drageras: @grimblymcgoo yes actually that cutscene was decent and Fyrakk never got anything like that
[3:05:57] TankenFunk: Old Gods canonically didn't happen in Vanilla, it is true
[3:06:04] karioke19: @elPEX  youre so welcome LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign
[3:06:05] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras becasue they already did that scene my guy
[3:06:10] futureforgotten: why would bandits even be able to stand up to adventurers that have fought gods
[3:06:23] Discordant_Hats: Wasn't the human heritage added in DF, isn't that...that
[3:06:27] Dreclador: Make an evoker. Super Chill backstory
[3:06:31] knightjudicator: @karioke19 thank you love you<3
[3:06:51] Arlaeya: freeze your level and keep doing deadmines....?
[3:06:53] Tenga66: Bandits in A TANK
[3:07:04] elbardo_ts: on the first classic raid you literally kill an elemental lord
[3:07:05] cyriosly: its hard to go back to killing bandits when we've killed literal gods
[3:07:07] SouvlakiTheBest: yes excactly why classic so polular
[3:07:10] Drageras: @tankenfunk I mean tyrande killed nathanos in that one cinematic. Why can't they cripple some in other cinematics. We need a balance of cool, sad, terrifying moments
[3:07:15] bellzzar1: i actually love the idea that our characters don't know everything and that's how we should feel when something happens and we don't know what's going on or the major characters don't either feels more alive
[3:07:31] Necoc: poor Nathanos
[3:07:37] atamala: @SouvlakiTheBest why do they make new shows when old shows are still good? hmmmge
[3:07:39] schlakt: speaking of bandits. would love deadmines as m+ in WTT!
[3:07:40] elbardo_ts: on the third classic raid you kill an old god
[3:07:50] Drageras: Lmaoo
[3:07:50] delirious152007: she last hit him lol
[3:07:57] karioke19: @knightjudicator LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign  enjoy!
[3:08:00] cyriosly: kill steal :(
[3:08:02] databob1: we lloosened him up
[3:08:16] databob1: like a jar lid
[3:08:30] grin1ing: @TaliesinAndEvitel was it explained how Nathanos was so powerful anyway?
[3:08:33] TankenFunk: @Drageras Dragonflight has a lot of cool, sad AND terrifying moments, if we disagree on that part then idk what to say tneEvi
[3:08:34] Tenga66: We were merely just a setback
[3:08:34] SirSheepalot: There's a a better example with Garrosh and thrall i guess
[3:08:49] alextheblight: nathanos was a stinky boy
[3:09:11] databob1: dev threw him a character boost
[3:09:13] delirious152007: Is Nathanos actually dead tho? since he never showed up in shadowlands? :P
[3:09:33] SouvlakiTheBest: Tyrande is really strong if you played warcraft 3 you know even without the night warrior thing
[3:09:37] random_redshirt: @delirious152007 He's dead, we just didn't run into him.
[3:09:43] furya91: the only oh no moment i felt in DF was the attack of the loamm niffen city from fyrakk but the after effect from the attck felt underwhelming
[3:09:52] grin1ing: the best of DF's story was in side-quests, sadly
[3:09:53] grimblymcgoo: @delirious152007 I traded his anima for a sick mog
[3:09:55] Tenga66: Nathanos went to the Blightenwald
[3:10:01] Drageras: @tankenfunk the side stories were good, but the main story might have been the most boring of all time.
[3:10:13] bellzzar1: sylvanas has a line that she is looking for him in the maw
[3:10:31] Discordant_Hats: Loosely related, but a liiiitle worried about 10.1 probably being the least received patch environmentally, at least after time, and War Within being so underground.
[3:10:38] SirSheepalot: and the leadup
[3:10:48] Tenga66: But the WAR people would tell you, the only interesting thing about WW1 was the mustard gas
[3:10:58] Drageras: Shadowlands was actually like ruining previous lore (except for denathrius), and in comparison Dragonflight is just bland which is an improvement I guess
[3:11:21] Drageras: @discordant_hats are you sure Korthia wasn't more hated lmao?
[3:11:40] random_redshirt: WoW often has good side stories.  Zone stories in Shadowlands and BfA were great, it was the overall campaigns that were more disliked.
[3:11:43] HazMatt_Prime: Random thought, Tali, everytime you bring up player housing, I'm reminded of WoD Strongholds....
[3:11:44] mckblitz: True, like the real life story of Charlie Brown in WW2
[3:11:53] Dreclador: I like Vyranoth's story. An interesting character
[3:12:03] atamala: god that varian letter was so woke.  imagine writing a letter to your son
[3:12:06] Discordant_Hats: @Drageras haha DF specifically I meant.
[3:12:08] grin1ing: but if you have a good story, why not focus on it instead. give it cinematics, focus player's attention on it, instead of helping niffin hunt for underworld treasure
[3:12:11] Saiyori: that would have been so much better
[3:12:16] bellzzar1: i think that would have been way better
[3:12:17] JMcGhee559: my favorite localized wow storytelling was the drustvar storyline in BFA
[3:12:20] Tenga66: Fortunate Son in the background
[3:12:48] TankenFunk: @grin1ing You need both, and wow now is doing that much better than previously
[3:12:57] databob1: they should do more more with the drust
[3:13:18] Tenga66: Niffen got burned
[3:13:36] waterdust619: The biggest concern I have for War within story telling, is how are they going to provide all the previous story that are relevant from the previous expansions, mostly for newer players
[3:13:41] OGpersi_: i think they were agreeing, just that those side-quests should be brought up more rather than being relegated to quest text
[3:13:44] Drageras: I wish for the niffen we got a cinematic where Fyrakk came in and one of those little moles kissed his mole wife, and mole kids, and went out to battle and protect his family
[3:13:45] JMcGhee559: I love learning about the movers and shakers as a way to frame and add context to the what and why of the human experience
[3:14:17] grin1ing: sorry, i'm just annoyed that i can't enjoy the main story anymore
[3:14:51] furya91: tali do you prefer the hero narrative that our character does iin current wow or do you prefer the adventurer feel from classic wow?
[3:15:05] elbardo_ts: I'm going to go with my guts feeling that most wow players don't really know what they want and the only think they know they want is the opposite of whatever is happening in the game the moment you ask them the question.
[3:15:06] ka_gu_ra: It's like in Forsight saga where you monitor cultural and historical change through the life of one family (though a rich one)
[3:15:07] Darkalex175: not every story is going to resonate with everyone, and thats to be expected
[3:15:15] Drageras: Legion was by far the most cohesive storytelling experience. No hiding the plot from the players. The "twist" reveals happened in real time like when Illidan destroyed the chandelier. Sarge stabbing Earth
[3:15:31] Drageras: Even had the coolest moments like Argus in the sky
[3:15:37] Tenga66: People miss deep moments when the subjects aren't who they care for
[3:15:51] grimblymcgoo: @Drageras You cannot say the plot wasnt hidden. There were 13 differnt class halls that you had to level through to fully understand the story
[3:15:55] thunduz: lucky!
[3:15:59] atamala: o/ have a good night
[3:16:00] PAZek_: Nugs!? Poggers
[3:16:03] alextheblight: Aw
[3:16:05] elbardo_ts: that's the worst deal ever tali
[3:16:12] Toiarc: You should go to kids party instead. Not many times you see them party
[3:16:12] Nulgar: Yummy nugs!
[3:16:15] PandaliciousGaming: I'm very jealous
[3:16:18] databob1: ooff sorry
[3:16:22] aeson_of_raid_sock: you american
[3:16:24] Nulgar: Guten Apetit!
[3:16:24] delirious152007: Nugs Party!
[3:16:26] KhrysW: Better go before they munch on your nuggets again lol
[3:16:29] Drageras: @grimblymcgoo the class campaigns individually weren't required to understand the main story of the expansion
[3:16:30] furya91: lol
[3:16:30] thunduz: get them nugs!!!
[3:16:31] witchhobbit: LUL

[3:17:03] aeson_of_raid_sock: truly an American
[3:17:05] alextheblight: <3 <3
[3:17:06] Drageras: @grimblymcgoo and by hidden I mean more like "Sylvanas or the Jailers hidden plans"
[3:17:10] schlakt: good chat Tali!
