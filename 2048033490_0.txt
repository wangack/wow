[0:09:24] Cooperharley0204: lock is cracked

[0:19:55] BBMezzy: How dare you be nice!
[0:20:04] Suze_o_0: so much hate in the wolrd
[0:20:17] Larkaro: From what i have seen on twitter, having a women as president means the game will go woke and then die
[0:20:23] matyanddillon: what’s wrong with this world
[0:20:30] stljay73: What a bad rep of WoW community, cant be nice
[0:20:33] MediumRareOG: a death threat combined with an anime pfp would make you the most average twitter user
[0:21:18] matyanddillon: do you have any tips for getting big on YouTube
[0:21:24] matyanddillon: or twitch
[0:21:29] nuclearphosphate: well call of duty has gone crap fast so.... LUL

[0:21:42] Haestoh: NFL has pretty good advertising if thats anything to go by.
[0:21:49] SlithTheSivak: her marketing job doesn't speak well to products, like steve jobs said when a company is ran by marketers instead of designers its the death knell

[0:22:50] Layliah79: elybroLurk another darn meeting UGH
[0:22:50] nuclearphosphate: as a president, she will be sitting in her office doing feck all LUL
[0:23:14] MediumRareOG: @imjoeski Steve Jobs was talking about finance and sales people when the company has a monopoly
[0:23:40] Larkaro: I will hold any thoughts about her until her first public address  as prez
[0:23:56] nuclearphosphate: ugh.... on that note, i will just wait till ALL of SoD is out before i ACTUALLY get to play it, bloody servers NEED improving, i STILL havent got into it
[0:24:01] Haestoh: SOD HYPE SOD HYPE
[0:24:11] nuclearphosphate: GDKP?
[0:24:12] ZellieMoogle: oo I haven't played any SoD, will have to come check out the stream! Im a Wrath baby so didnt play back in those days LUL
[0:24:18] Faeynna: Let her start first maybe. :D As she starts February 5th. :D
[0:24:21] Larkaro: haha the GDKP stans are furious right nowe
[0:24:38] nuclearphosphate: whats GDKP?
[0:24:56] Haestoh: I'm gonna drag some Tinklers through a BFD run tonight to get them their 7/7 if you're around.
[0:25:19] MediumRareOG: I'm not opposed to GDKP in principle but it becamse the funnel for bought gold. If there was no gold buying, GDKPs would be fine
[0:25:35] ZellieMoogle: oo let us seeee :D
[0:25:51] MediumRareOG: like in TBC I think someone paid 200k gold for a DST or something like that
[0:27:15] Lestatis: i'm a sucker for the "Bwaaaaaaa"s
[0:27:23] Suze_o_0: omg chills
[0:27:38] Switzout: You made this vid?
[0:27:46] ellenara35: awesome!!
[0:27:54] ZellieMoogle: Love it thefor74WOW valaer1Hype
[0:27:57] Suze_o_0: that is great!
[0:27:57] LegendOfKilla: that was sick Pog @MrGM
[0:28:00] viscka_games: reminds me of the official wow esports hype videos
[0:28:03] MediumRareOG: 100% no cap, that's fucking awesome
[0:28:03] Switzout: I feel like the push in on Season 3 that happened about 20-30 second ago could have zoomed a bit faster
[0:28:04] Arlaeya: This is great!!
[0:28:06] Bware2: great - got a little MDI trailer vibe
[0:28:08] SlithTheSivak: hype
[0:28:08] ChrisCarty: that video looks awesome!
[0:28:08] Switzout: Other than that, great
[0:28:08] elderratt: its great
[0:28:10] Suze_o_0: Wochi will love it!
[0:28:11] iiamBaro: replay it i just joined
[0:28:15] iiamBaro: :)
[0:28:17] Lestatis: it's fantastic for the hype
[0:28:19] Haestoh: I love it but I don't really get the stream POV clip in the middle.
[0:29:01] matyanddillon: what streaming software do you use
[0:29:08] Larkaro: You could cut it after the initial title card. I personally would make it 30-45 seconds.
[0:29:14] Vidaloo: Feels like the Logo is coming too many times, It's like its trying to do a reveal but doesnt know when to
[0:29:31] stljay73: What is Dungeon Dojo?
[0:29:36] MediumRareOG: I think it's a good idea to have some actual gameplay in there, like a transition from trailers and in-game video to gameplay
[0:29:46] Vidaloo: Fair fair fair
[0:29:52] Haestoh: The black outline on the Dungeon Dojo text bothers me, but I'm not sure if thats the video or the logo.
[0:29:57] RAF_Sean: it looks great
[0:30:04] Suze_o_0: raids, m+ Dojo is great! They helped me get back into the game again!
[0:30:22] Haestoh: yo yo
[0:30:23] calphan84: good morning
[0:30:25] Lestatis: 2nd monday of the week

[0:30:31] ChrisCarty: it’s najatar BMAH toy farming
[0:30:40] Vidaloo: Loved it otherwise, very cool pace and montage
[0:30:40] RAF_Sean: I'm here but just for 30 then I have to record. I'll be back tho
[0:30:41] matyanddillon: haven’t played wow in ages played more spider man remastered and Fortnite been saying go get back on wow but I never do
[0:30:41] EllenorEdition: CoolCat
[0:30:47] ZellieMoogle: valaer1Wave  I may have fallen back to sleep and only just woken up at 1pm, so I need to make breakfast still LUL But I am here!
[0:30:52] Pathstrider: good afternoon
[0:30:57] Larkaro: yo yo
[0:30:59] Arlaeya: here but getting in a dig before reset and a meeting

[0:31:20] Haestoh: CHEWSDAY
[0:31:32] Niixten: Doing zg relic farm for all the mogs and patterns
[0:31:57] ZellieMoogle: Btw thank you for making the Twitch Drop animation for us all to use, such a nice thing to do! wattsHEART
[0:32:02] Switzout: What do you do if you love the gameplay of a class but hate the transmog (monk). =(
[0:32:29] Rokir_: Razorthorn Rush is a nightmare
[0:32:53] Faeynna: It's sad that you have to do it though! Blizzard should be able to provide that stuff. :)
[0:32:57] matyanddillon: when dragon flight first dropped me and my dad thought blizzard removed the auction house then we googled where it was
[0:33:09] ZellieMoogle: Thats why youre my kind of streamer, wholesome vibes are what we need more of <3
[0:33:19] Haestoh: Good Guy Dan
[0:34:08] MediumRareOG: Idea: you could use that same vibe/idea/structure as the Dojo video to make a Starforge video
[0:34:23] Faeynna: I have seen your work on other streamers, so I hope you get some thanks etc! :)
[0:34:25] Rokir_: Need the MrGM Outland Cup Gold Guide
[0:35:22] flabo: shattrath and that one in hellfire pen were a nightmare to gold
[0:35:47] MediumRareOG: Imagine this: trailers of dungeons, throw in low-key Starforge logos but transitioning to you playing on the PC instead of gameplay

[0:37:47] Calfast: No one can fooget Bellular's Balls
[0:38:34] Lestatis: 100%
[0:38:49] Haestoh: 10/10 idea
[0:38:51] Haestoh: "Hello everyone, welcome to this follower dungeon mount guide video. But first let me give you a guide on how to shave your balls."
[0:39:15] Elrathir: mrgmHelloThere Hello there
[0:39:18] Duffman1001: Afternoon mate
[0:39:38] MediumRareOG: the doubloon drop rate is way too low. too much RNG too with NPCs up and the islands in the weekly rotation
[0:39:44] EllenorEdition: Wouldve been cool if Blizz brought the expeditions into each expansion since bfa
[0:40:18] Larkaro: How to get legacy legendarys
[0:40:26] ZellieMoogle: oo sounds like a great idea! Ive decided to go down the route of guide videos too (for a different game though), much more my style than other types of videos :)
[0:40:40] ZellieMoogle: I imagine youve got a tonne of knowledge to share!
[0:40:41] drazial113: i like the idea of those guides for sure
[0:40:57] stljay73: I would loe it, notmany videos for casual, solo players
[0:41:06] stljay73: love*
[0:41:06] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:41:38] shaddzz: MrGM has been grinding for years and it paid off
[0:41:48] RobeertIV: What do you think about the new CEO of Blizzard, formerly working on Activision?
[0:41:55] ZellieMoogle: I love the idea of guides though, because even if it doesnt do well fast, you know its always useful to someone somewhere in the future <3
[0:42:25] Larkaro: Thats my biggest fear so making content. spending hours on research and editing just for the video to sit at 1 or 2 views
[0:42:27] ZellieMoogle: Yessss exactly <3
[0:42:36] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft

[0:43:59] shaddzz: Im here for the accent
[0:44:05] MachoCham: Afternoons
[0:44:14] ZellieMoogle: @drazial113 Yes 100%!
[0:44:19] ChrisCarty: @shaddzz 😂
[0:44:22] Suze_o_0: Hey Cham :)
[0:44:29] MachoCham: Everyone good?
[0:44:31] shaddzz: yea I lurk around still lol glad to see you good
[0:44:31] Faeynna: I liked Island Expeditions, they should just not have had the azerite reward on it. :) Because then it became a do it as efficient as possible, and no exploration.
[0:44:53] shaddzz: Yea im an old man now haha
[0:45:50] ZellieMoogle: Aw no, so sorry <3
[0:45:54] flabo: the one thing that bothers me a ton about islands is how difficult is to get quest items
[0:46:19] MachoCham: Also can confirm Mum and DadGM are great
[0:46:52] shaddzz: everyone I know who buys electric and NOT a Tesla regrets it cause they cant find as many charging spots as Tesla
[0:47:06] Lestatis: how many months do they need to wait if they order it? Teslas in NA usually have a 6 month waiting period
[0:47:09] Faeynna: I wouldn't go with Nissan after the Leaf thing.
[0:47:20] MachoCham: I would Leaf the Nissan alone
[0:47:22] MachoCham: Kappa
[0:47:40] ZellieMoogle: I know nothing about cars, If I had big money for a vehicle it would be a Harley Davidson :D
[0:47:48] Faeynna: :D
[0:47:55] shaddzz: @Lestatis they opened a new Tesla dealership by me the lot ws FULL prob over 200 of them and gone all in 1 weekend
[0:47:58] Lestatis: oh wow
[0:48:01] ZellieMoogle: LUL
[0:48:03] RAF_Sean: That's wild lol

[0:48:23] Faeynna: Give the paint atleast 48hours to dry. :P
[0:49:16] Faeynna: Can't buy Teslas in Sweden currently though. ^.^
[0:49:20] ZellieMoogle: Yeah decent access to charging is gotta be important!
[0:49:24] matyanddillon: the car in front of me is a Tesla I think
[0:49:44] ratExterminatorDevie: What's good king
[0:49:52] shaddzz: In the States you get a nice tax break for owning one
[0:50:06] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS Easier with Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[0:50:26] Faeynna: Union is blocking Tesla.
[0:50:33] Xesol: i almost bought one but they were too small for the family
[0:50:34] cryptolegendary: Brabus here
[0:50:46] Hotstitute: like $4000 per battery to replace
[0:50:46] Faeynna: So they had a hard time getting their license-plates as well
[0:50:50] fooxytv: they are awful, I had one has a company car
[0:50:51] Haestoh: Before the massive rise in energy bills I was on the cusp of getting an electric car, but that put me off for now cause it's not that much cheaper.
[0:51:11] EddieMakes: my 'shitty' old Nissan has only appreciated
[0:51:29] fooxytv: first problem, plan your journey
[0:51:36] MediumRareOG: It depends on your electricity prices
[0:51:50] fooxytv: you are surprised what the range is and how they perform in the UK with our weather
[0:51:57] Hotstitute: fuel prices in teh US are not as bad as the internet is telling people... highest it ever got was $7 in california and they arleady pay $5 a gallon... but in non cali, its like $2.80
[0:51:57] Roflrobbie: Sup yall
[0:52:02] Sharxkin: new Blizzard exec announced
[0:52:12] fooxytv: bad
[0:52:38] Hotstitute: Cali has a tax to encourage people to use public transport
[0:52:40] MediumRareOG: It's like $3-3.50 in Florida
[0:52:58] Haestoh: Petrol atm is like £1.36 I think
[0:53:01] Thoreya: whys it so expensive
[0:53:07] stljay73: $2.29 for gas in Missouri
[0:53:10] ZellieMoogle: Time to lurk and actually go have some food, have a great day all! <3
[0:53:12] Hotstitute: America isnt built for public transport sadly.. Australia is
[0:53:20] Roflrobbie: in America, fuel price is dependant on state taxes. Theres a baseline, cross-country price, but then the state adds taxes depending on what their reasoning is
[0:53:21] MediumRareOG: Public transport should be free
[0:53:30] Faeynna: I think the best thing for the climate, is to make public transport free.
[0:53:30] stljay73: yes
[0:53:40] Lestatis: 1.60 CAD per Liter
[0:53:43] MediumRareOG: Yeah but you're living in Missouri... so not worth it
[0:53:54] Laevykinz: Morning, everyone.  How's the new PC treating ya?
[0:54:00] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:54:06] Hotstitute: there is local trains, but as an example, In australia our trains were every 30minutes, in America its every 4 hours
[0:54:10] Roflrobbie: 10.2.6 is WoW Battle Royale pvp mode calling it now
[0:54:11] EddieMakes: you'd imagine UK trains would be priced at cost. So we can use it more
[0:54:16] Larkaro: how much is fuel at the moment
[0:54:17] MachoCham: That sounds like something a socialist would say
[0:54:26] Calfast: I've seen trains from one part of the UK to the other that cost more than a flight
[0:54:34] Faeynna: Taxes should pay for it. Making it free cuts down on costs as well.. like ticket machines, people that control tickets etc
[0:54:45] EddieMakes: I'm in the North East, family in Cornwall. It cost me £400
[0:54:53] dright424: they wanted tp put a high speed train in cali but it got stuck in local government battles
[0:55:03] MediumRareOG: We subsidize driving with roads, free street parking, etc. why does public transport need to make a profit?
[0:55:18] MachoCham: Our public transport was government owned and then they sold it off to private sector
[0:55:19] Calfast: A lot of them are I think
[0:55:31] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:55:32] Haestoh: All UK public transport is privately owned I think
[0:55:35] Sharxkin: Blizzard will now be run by a former Activision executive
[0:55:35] Calfast: Virgin Rail, etc
[0:55:48] Hotstitute: But its not just that, Many areas outside of the city dont even have footpaths, they dont really encourage you walking, and when they do those footpaths are not well maintained or dangerous to walk on. Foot Bridges are not a common thing outside of bustling Cities and crossing roads requires going to Intersections which causes more delays for transport and danger for walking
[0:56:04] matyanddillon: it is for me
[0:56:10] Roflrobbie: @MrGM in other news, I'm calling 10.2.6 is WoW Battle Royale
[0:56:32] Hotstitute: In Australia there was a way to walk from the south of a city to the northern suburbs of a city, if you wanted
[0:56:35] mrcalwell: @imjoeski I think technically Scotrail is publically owned but until recently was owned by Abellio
[0:56:49] Elrathir: @Roflrobbie okay but make it pirate themed
[0:56:51] MediumRareOG: I had walking directions in the US tell me to just run across a highway (speed limit 45) as there was no way for pedestrians to cross
[0:56:56] Haestoh: @Roflrobbie "CHAMPION!, welcome to the Gulag!"
[0:57:02] Faeynna: @Roflrobbie AV but 80 people?! vs each other
[0:57:39] Binge_Bear: Was sold off in the late 80's to private companies by Margret Thatcher since then they have passed through different rail providers who bail out when the government steps in wanting them to improve, but they just drink in profits and leave the infrastructure to breaking point thus putting up prices.
[0:57:51] Elrathir: LUL
[0:57:52] Hotstitute: GOTTEM!
[0:57:56] EddieMakes: LUL classic UK
[0:58:01] azzurrin: savage
[0:58:11] Larkaro: classic geeza
[0:58:19] EddieMakes: whilst he downs his pint and goes for a smoke
[0:58:26] Haestoh: oooft' what a lad
[0:58:50] Calfast: Poppa geeza
[0:58:56] stljay73: Since they hid anyinfo for 10.2.6 on roadmap, do you think it will have a PTR? or they going to do a SoD thing?
[0:59:22] Hotstitute: I think more cities in the US should encourage public transport.. Alot of people are also afraid of it as they have heard of dangerous situations on trains aswell. NYC has a famous rail system full of addicts and such, you are surrounded by other people so you are safer
[0:59:24] Elrathir: SNEAKY PETE
[0:59:32] Hotstitute: Didnt 10.2.6 just get a PTR build yesterday?
[0:59:52] Roflrobbie: nah i'm saying 10.2.6 wont be on PTR. Whatever it is it'll be a "Play 10.2.6 LIVE TODAY!"
[1:00:01] adampanerabread: yo!
[1:00:32] matyanddillon: what did I miss on wow in the past 2 months
[1:00:34] Hotstitute: told you SoD was coming!
[1:00:47] dright424: lived in nyc for a few years, using the subway is a lot easier than driving in the city
[1:00:48] Hotstitute: 1000%
[1:01:06] Hotstitute: yeah, i would never drive in NYC
[1:01:07] Binge_Bear: Do you think that classic will stop after panda land?
[1:01:10] Roflrobbie: "This... is World of Warcraft's newest PVP mode.... Battle Royale! A free-for-all of 100 players. Win Tenders for the trading post!"
[1:01:22] Hotstitute: even taxis are iffy, i only used them if i needed it desperately
[1:01:47] Xesol: no you just cant be in a raid group
[1:01:50] SlithTheSivak: once inside the arena ya
[1:01:50] Hotstitute: no, its faction.. BUT
[1:01:50] Xesol: you can be in a 5 man i believe
[1:02:01] stljay73: @dright424 I lived in Las Vegas, bus is much easier than driving and cheaper
[1:02:06] Hotstitute: there is a raid event in teh arena, and the second it finishes, its a ffa

[1:24:36] Haestoh: ooooft'
[1:24:43] bwoods79: With xmog I have always wondered how many people actually change their appearance and how often. Some find 1 outfit they love and stick with but I know others than change daily
[1:25:00] MachoCham: It is to an extent, you can't ignore items tho
[1:25:09] Faeynna: I change... depending on mood. :P
[1:25:18] Faeynna: And depending on specialization as well. xD
[1:25:41] Faeynna: Different mog for Demonology and Destruction for example
[1:25:45] Calfast: Depends on vibes, or if I get a really cool item or theme I wanna build a set around

[1:26:38] Jack_the_Dipper: I like that Blizzard finally added Warcraft 1 and Warcraft 2 to the battlenet store
[1:26:38] Niixten: I want the system that ff14 got, when you earn x amount fo achi points you cen get stuff from a vendor.
[1:26:56] bwoods79: i remember running around the island to round them all up and nuking them down

[1:27:06] Faeynna: That was pretty much out of the blue :o
[1:27:08] MediumRareOG: What I don't like about Islands is it's hard for me to target a particular mount or cosmetic
[1:27:27] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:27:27] Calfast: @Niixten Cosmetics and stuff would be cool
[1:27:28] MediumRareOG: Plus it doesn't give enough doubloons

[1:34:52] Jack_the_Dipper: I hear the pc
[1:36:00] Jack_the_Dipper: Thats a Shure SM7B right? In theory it should not pick up background sound. 2 things it can, input it too high or you have the compression set really high
[1:37:29] Jack_the_Dipper: One of the great things of a Shure SM7B is that it is aa dynamic mic.   it will picck up sound only very close to the receiver but yes it is picking up aa lot
[1:37:50] Larkaro: Still here
[1:38:25] Jack_the_Dipper: no worries, im an audiofile and I get annoyed but unwanted sound LUL

[1:40:35] Vidaloo: Actually we here your breathing a lot more
[1:40:39] madmaninabox75: the only thing that actually worked for me is nVidia broadcast
[1:40:43] Vidaloo: hear
[1:41:01] madmaninabox75: I'd like not to be tied to a specific brand of GPU card (and series), but it really works
[1:41:24] vuhdubones: how dare you breathe
[1:41:48] madmaninabox75: Also, nVidia broadcast plugin for wavelink does fuck all, so don't waste your time trying it out

[1:56:28] thunduz: I think I know why people are angry and it’s easy to figure out why…
[1:56:29] Layliah79: not much at all to be upset about in the game anymore, so people just grasp onto anything to rage about
[1:56:29] windfrenzy: kill akunda boss add fast
[1:56:36] windfrenzy: or tutrle when she spawns
[1:56:38] JakeSezz: How dare she be a woman and be in charge of a game?! mrgmO Fucking nerds
[1:56:38] Poromaniak: maybe they think that bcs she was leader for call of duty that she will focus 100% on CoD?
[1:56:46] Yanoru: Activision, Blizzard & Microsoft all have one thing in common: They want to make investors happy. This is the first priority. Always has been.
[1:57:01] Larkaro: Shit like that makes me sad to be apart of wow
[1:57:16] funviking99: true

[1:58:22] traktordestrucktor: you need a pet to keep them seperatre
[1:58:39] windfrenzy: they dont need seperated on normal
[1:58:57] windfrenzy: just once akunda spawns make sure your turtled
[1:58:58] traktordestrucktor: eaven with a pet u get the silence and it will take some time
[1:59:01] windfrenzy: itll dodge the first one
[1:59:02] Yanoru: Biggest problem with Twitter nowadays is, that everyone in the replies of huge tweets wants to farm revenue.
[1:59:04] JakeSezz: Sooooo…you gotta keep em separated? mrgmJAM mrgmJAM
[1:59:09] windfrenzy: and gives you 45 secs to kill her
[1:59:15] databob1: Ots not she's a game dev ages on the business side. If she enjoys games it would be nice if she gives her company's products a try but it's not necessary to do her job
[1:59:26] LegendOfKilla: catJAM
[1:59:45] databob1: Sorry just woke up

[2:00:57] windfrenzy: he comes out after you kill 2 of the other bosses
[2:01:18] databob1: @machocham yeah that's what I'm trying to say.

[2:02:57] databob1: I just hope their paying her properly
[2:03:07] dright424: the next boss is not soloable either
[2:03:10] BBMezzy: It'd be better to just wait for the BfA solo changes
[2:03:17] MachoCham: Planning on doing timewanking raid tomorrow?
[2:04:33] Larkaro: Like last sping ever?

[2:08:06] jamal__3: What do you think wich one of these races will be the best for a Hunter? Blood Elf -Zandalari or Worgen? I’m not about to get #1 dps just solo casual playing. i like all the 3 for some reason and cant decide for a good reason wich one to pick
[2:08:13] Faeynna: I loved the Dragon Island beta coverage etc
[2:08:30] Larkaro: I'll edit for you for free if you get me Alpha lol
[2:08:32] MachoCham: I'm saying no-one knows but at this point you'd be better off consulting a psychic, reading crystals or other scams to get the release date
[2:08:49] Layliah79: Hmm
[2:08:58] MachoCham: Quantify very?
[2:09:02] LegendOfKilla: 2 verys Pog
[2:09:05] MachoCham: Is each very a week or a month?

[2:10:02] dright424: well, on the roadmap alpha is closer to winter than spring and we only have like 7 weeks left of winter
[2:10:02] databob1: It's going to sneak up and assault us in the night. .tonight.  MUH HAHAHAHA
[2:10:07] Faeynna: Soon is like 3 months...
[2:10:22] Troniin: How much closer does each very add
[2:10:30] MachoCham: 2025 is very soon compared to the release of the first iPhone
[2:10:30] wastedxtime93: Morning!
[2:10:31] spherical_time: Look for shiny starfish next to paths.
[2:10:32] LegendOfKilla: winter is ending very very soon 5Head
[2:10:44] databob1: Sorry just woke up brains loopy
[2:10:54] Vidaloo: IMO, very very soon sounds like Begin - mid Feb, very soon is mid to end Feb, soon is March
[2:11:27] CentaurFire: What zone is this
[2:11:34] MachoCham: Pop into chat and say "what's this about soon"
[2:11:37] LegendOfKilla: probably not LUL
[2:11:44] EllenorEdition: You could just ask him Kappa
[2:11:51] JakeSezz: I feel like ‘soon’ or even ‘very soon’ is no more than 4 weeks

[2:12:04] spherical_time: Nazjatar
[2:12:12] jamal__3: @centaurfire  nazjatar

[2:12:25] jamal__3: Bfa zone.

[2:15:16] Jack_the_Dipper: thats a lot
[2:15:24] Jack_the_Dipper: serious
[2:15:31] Xesol: it happens in every industry its sad
[2:15:32] LegendOfKilla: 12000 LUL
[2:15:37] ImperfectDark: makes sense. Logistics companies hired INSANELY as a result of covid
[2:15:40] MachoCham: I hope all the business analysts on Twitter are jumping on that
[2:15:43] Faeynna: That's... a lot :(
[2:15:55] Jack_the_Dipper: want me to link the article?
[2:16:17] Xesol: they all over hired during covid and are coming back down to earth
[2:16:20] ArduousBow: It was bound to happen once people realized herd immunity was achieved when it came to covid.
[2:16:21] Kydar: businesses used to be run by people, and have shame around layoffs, not so much anymore
[2:16:33] ArduousBow: Now we're just left into a bad state of hiring because of the faux inflation.
[2:16:52] MachoCham: *looks at COVID rates* *looks at herd immunity*
[2:16:59] Troniin: You think more is gonna come out from that Vince McMahon lawsuit? Dude was an absolute pos.
[2:17:03] magemaster225: exalted cache mount?
[2:17:03] MachoCham: Bold statement
[2:17:36] MachoCham: Makes you wonder about some of the other accusations
[2:17:36] amricatt: He is pretty skeezy.
[2:17:36] LegendOfKilla: whats going on with vince
[2:17:40] MachoCham: Like Nailz
[2:17:46] databob1: What lawsuit?
[2:17:46] spherical_time: lol, I used to run this as a mage, and that area was deadly
[2:17:55] ArduousBow: @MachoCham Well when I'm saying 'herd immunity' I'm using it very loosely the 'vaccine' was literally only able to be called that because they changed the definition of what could be a 'vaccine' as a whole
[2:17:59] dright424: idk, there were more layoffs in the years leading up to the pandemic, I just think people are talking about layoffs now
[2:18:16] Layliah79: he's not good looking at all.
[2:18:19] Layliah79: never was IMO
[2:18:30] LegendOfKilla: vince on epstein island DansGame
[2:18:31] ArduousBow: ^True
[2:18:39] databob1: Damn that's awful..who did that?
[2:18:42] MachoCham: Is it a Civil lawsuit?
[2:18:45] wastedxtime93: Read a bunch of nasty stuff involving poo
[2:19:05] MachoCham: I.E. it's only a financial suit, he can't serve hard times daddy
[2:19:11] archmagus1: Stop the presses, Vince McMahon did something vile? preposterous XD
[2:19:14] ArduousBow: Watching othr people play WoW because my realms are all down :(
[2:19:32] spherical_time: yes
[2:19:35] databob1: Eeewww but i am not at all suprised

[2:19:50] wastedxtime93: BRING IT BACK
[2:20:00] Calfast: I loved the minigame WQs of BFA
[2:20:01] ArduousBow: Dude this WQ was so fire; I bought the toy for it so I can afk play it while queueing for keys.
[2:20:14] ImperfectDark: i love these mini games, lol
[2:20:21] Kubwa7: i didn't play bfa, and i love those

[2:21:02] CentaurFire: oh
[2:21:09] BBMezzy: I think these mini game WQs are a good way to break the monotony of WQs. In small amounts I like them a lot
[2:21:41] ArduousBow: BFA WQs were great tbh
[2:21:44] databob1: Ok dragon riding there looks super fun
[2:21:54] ArduousBow: Like I even tolerated the tortollan ones.

[2:37:34] Haestoh: Did you hear anything more about the Ticketmaster scam thing?
[2:37:34] wastedxtime93: So I'm really liking the idea that the cross and skullbones is more a reference to decay and Brakenhide and not pirates
[2:37:40] Rokir_: Better late than never, got my campfire toy lol
[2:37:43] MachoCham: I wish there was a way to get PVP rewards without doing PVP Kappa

[2:38:38] ZellieMoogle: Has there been any confirmation if the WoW Twitter account has lost its staff, or is there a chance theyre just laying low for a bit? Its so strange not having the fun posts anymore BibleThump

[2:46:51] Arlaeya: cosmetic a mount. a smidgen of lore if you;'re into that. I am, but all I wanted was a library tab, lol

[2:46:58] death_cam_: it takes a year of just only doing  the weekly quest to buy all the cosmetic rewards
[2:47:23] s7wede: I have all of them already. It does not take a year
[2:47:28] dwolf010: I hope 2 AM CET is not the new normal for publishing wow articles
[2:47:33] Ace_Trekkie: Caverns i think.
[2:47:48] s7wede: yes
[2:47:53] death_cam_: @s7wede all the vendor cosmetics? 240k fragments
[2:47:58] Niixten: use World Quests List addon
[2:48:02] s7wede: I'm also rank 5
[2:48:06] CalibungleJustJohnP: hahaha that will be a hard nope then, i used to grind all the rep rewards for years, but i have got immensely bored of all the long long grinds that are in the game.  i am just glad tehy are cosmetics only mostly
[2:48:07] Pinkupz: probably alts
[2:48:17] death_cam_: did you do 250 digs lol
[2:48:18] s7wede: no alts
[2:48:38] death_cam_: thought alts dont get the 5k fragments from weekly just 3k rep
[2:48:56] kaijoe_: Can't it also drop for you from a dig?
[2:48:58] s7wede: I have done almost every dig available apart from the time I'm sleeping since I work from home
[2:49:06] tarnishedvalor: i'm close to having the frags...i've been doing somewhere between 3-5 digs a day (rep for me is slower)
[2:49:25] CalibungleJustJohnP: @s7wede dont you have work to do if you work from home?
[2:49:46] BBMezzy: I look forward to the day I'm done with the fragments
[2:49:52] death_cam_: @CalibungleJustJohnP tbf you can semi afk the digs on high pop realms
[2:50:00] s7wede: I'm a consultant, which means I can consult and work on my laptop at the same time :)
[2:50:18] tarnishedvalor: quicker would be better
[2:50:19] BBMezzy: 57k to go HahaSweat

[2:51:23] Faeynna: Vulpera best race
[2:51:27] tarnishedvalor: that's what i did re: hearth
[2:51:27] StreamElements: How to Obtain 2 MOUNTS Easier with Follower Dungeons in Dragonflight - https://youtu.be/zAPE_7sX2gI
[2:51:27] CalibungleJustJohnP: vulpera should be excommunicated from the game
[2:51:30] s7wede: Don't be, I suffer from intense OCD which means I hyperfixate
[2:51:34] death_cam_: they could of made rep rewards a fragment % gain buff each time :P
[2:51:55] chelfx: i also dont understand the tomb RNG
[2:52:04] chelfx: getting 5 greens a dig suck
[2:52:06] Faeynna: Reason why I stopped playing my paladin. No vulpadins yet!
[2:52:15] Vidaloo: what's the name of the song in the background?
[2:53:27] Harai_Ulfsark: at which level can people dragonride now? 30? 60?
[2:53:34] ImperfectDark: @Vidaloo Shazam says "Say My Name" (feat. November Lights)

[2:58:25] Vidaloo: @ImperfectDark Thanks!
[2:58:53] Vidaloo: I hope you can switch mid-flight tho
[3:00:01] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:00:06] Harai_Ulfsark: tip: you can easily get the skyscourge title by dismounting the bots flying in this area, in warmode of course
[3:00:40] s7wede: The gathering bots that swarm nodes in Zaralec
[3:00:55] spherical_time: Lol, only like 0.1% of players have the Druid dragonriding flight form that drops from Mythic Fyrakk or some such nonsense.
[3:00:58] Harai_Ulfsark: turn on track humanoids and you should see them zapping everywhere KEKW
[3:01:18] Harai_Ulfsark: no they dragonride in a really weird way
[3:01:32] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:02:24] s7wede: Just a heads up. That specific WQ is broken
[3:02:42] s7wede: sometimes you can only find 2/3 items and you need to relog in warmode to get the final object to spawn
[3:02:50] Harai_Ulfsark: its a gamble if you'll have all 3 items or just 2
[3:02:57] Klinnloss: Worked for me :o
[3:03:36] Harai_Ulfsark: that's how i discovered there are bots dumb enough to be in warmode
[3:03:44] s7wede: I'm glad they fixed it then, when it spawned on Sat it was broken for everybody in my phase and it was just panic in general lol
[3:04:07] magemaster225: theres crafting mats you can only get in WM
[3:04:32] Minobard: What addon do you have that shows you when you've completed the dungeon on mythic
[3:05:01] Minobard: Thank you sir
[3:05:31] death_cam_: you can solo sl raids more than bfa mechanically
[3:05:37] dwolf010: they said that they will fix that in 10.2.6 i believe
[3:05:45] mikeygames: how's the new pc?
[3:05:48] chelfx: eyah
[3:05:55] spherical_time: yes, you can fly
[3:06:02] dright424: i am pretty sure every bfa raid is not soloable
[3:06:03] s7wede: @MrGM Another tip for next time to make the weekly easier from now on. When you have in the Valdrakken weekly and get all the rep tokens, Save them for the next weekly and you won't have to do any WQ's for rep
[3:06:04] Jack_the_Dipper: yeah fine
[3:06:04] death_cam_: still waiting for sl legacy loot lol i can solo them all but 20% chance of 1 item
[3:06:08] spherical_time: just get the flight point for future reference
[3:06:08] Harai_Ulfsark: audio is good so far
[3:06:12] BBMezzy: Audio has been fine
[3:06:21] Jack_the_Dipper: so far no hikups
[3:06:36] tarnishedvalor: i've been doing that by saving the 1 dream rep token which is 3k...so it's insta done
[3:06:37] mikeygames: still no word on what that suspicious bucket is for in the slaughtered lamb!

[3:07:46] mikeygames: you're not skinning Dan! that's gold on the floor
[3:07:59] funviking99: bfa dungeons are fun
[3:08:02] Harai_Ulfsark: nah its not
[3:08:05] mikeygames: probably not ha
[3:09:21] mikeygames: you can literally just face tank all the bosses
[3:09:28] Harai_Ulfsark: ive been maxing out my alts professions, i have classic, wod, shadowlands and DF master of all so far KEKWAIT
[3:10:11] spherical_time: I fish before bed sometimes, lol.  Very relaxing
[3:10:49] Minobard: except bfa raids still
[3:10:56] Tomalegendary: With the Warbands?
[3:11:05] dright424: do you have a speed set druid setup?
[3:11:06] Minobard: minobaLOVE  id be happy with that

[3:11:44] magemaster225: nerubian invasions
[3:11:45] Harai_Ulfsark: silithid invasion in silithus KEKW
[3:11:47] death_cam_: imagine if they bring back bear taretare type food in TWW for farming old content
[3:11:49] Minobard: have the crystal dwarves come up and then jewelcrafters need to shine them up for the dailies
[3:11:55] Jack_the_Dipper: I assume things in Silithus
[3:12:03] Niixten: I miss legion pre patch leveling, that was so good
[3:12:23] Jack_the_Dipper: SL pre patch was fun
[3:12:24] Minobard: i hope they bring back the winds buff
[3:12:26] Harai_Ulfsark: i liked SL prepatch too
[3:12:39] Jack_the_Dipper: yes 36
[3:12:43] Kubwa7: jewelcrafters will just be Spa workers for Earthen NotLikeThis
[3:12:53] Minobard: @Kubwa7 cant wait!
[3:13:34] Tomalegendary: Like the Horadic Haversack 36 slot bag we have. Was it for having authenticatior or something?
[3:14:04] Harai_Ulfsark: yes its from diablo event
[3:14:12] spherical_time: It was from the Diablo event
[3:14:17] Jack_the_Dipper: I got to do all the Silithus quests from Classic and BFA soon. Just to be sure I dont miss them
[3:14:22] Tomalegendary: ohh yes my bad
[3:14:41] spherical_time: The authenticator adds a row to your backback, the one you always have
[3:14:42] Harai_Ulfsark: silithus rocking 3 phases soon
[3:14:48] Jack_the_Dipper: kaatHmm yeah that could be as well
[3:15:43] chelfx: i liek the new pvp event
[3:15:44] Tmicrochip: I still wanna see a Zidormi phase where we go back to pre cata azeroth. (you can add a debuff so you can't fly in OG zones)
[3:15:50] chelfx: and howyou can opt out of it
[3:15:51] Minobard: it would be nice if they added the effect for selling greens to vendors that auto unlock transmog - similar to how the gray/white vendoring works.
[3:16:19] MachoCham: Depends if you don't all run off and leave me behind PepeHands
[3:17:04] chelfx: you can solo all the bosses but the last
[3:17:48] Harai_Ulfsark: recording starting KEKWAIT

[3:19:17] chelfx: wait why? smh
[3:19:32] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:19:52] MachoCham: What's Stephanie McMahon Helmsley got to do with it KEKW
[3:19:56] chelfx: Do we think we get anymore hero tree previews or we will get post on delves or another feature
[3:20:25] Minobard: I thought Stephanie ex-communicated her dad a few years back and its just strictly professional
[3:20:28] Dreandra: @MachoCham Oh lawdy the poor girl
[3:20:30] WochiTV: hello dan
[3:20:34] chelfx: delves can go 2 ways it sounds good until its not  or its like WQ
[3:20:48] WochiTV: all cool thanks
[3:20:50] Dreandra: I'm just glad her dad is out of the company now
[3:21:03] Minobard: same
[3:21:07] dright424: to be honest a reskinned torghast with some scalling would be fine. The issue with torghast was always the required nature of it.
[3:21:22] Minobard: Triple H and Michaels know how to put on some cool stuff
[3:21:42] Dreandra: Vince wanted to stop pushing Gunther, let that sink in

[3:22:40] WochiTV: cant stop watching THAT video. it soooo gooood
[3:22:44] Dreandra: Bronn is the future
[3:22:47] Minobard: Bronn is in a tough spot with his  dad being a jackass
[3:23:10] Minobard: i want them to push him, but his dad was spewing off about antigay/antitrans stuff
[3:23:12] Dreandra: Bronn is a fantastic athlete, even without his dad, he would be fine
[3:23:13] TruVillainManny: I caught up on Rumble but haven't watch RAW yet. It's hard to keep up with so many hours of wrestling in a week.

[3:59:50] dastago: lol some pissed off blizz dev fucked up the client before they left
[4:00:33] NeeK_23: why wait 7 years to bring it up?
[4:00:41] s7wede: You have a page on your youtube account that shows all your current strikes against other people.
[4:00:56] thunduz: no fun for MRGM
[4:01:04] Harai_Ulfsark: can people file a copystrike in your name? I know on twitter you can report someone on someone else's behalf (and it was pretty abused)
[4:01:05] s7wede: Under the creator dashboard
[4:01:33] s7wede: It's called Removal requests

[4:07:50] dastago: worst part for me with that achievement was camping the rares. there were a couple that took me so long to get
[4:08:26] dastago: don't think so
[4:09:10] Harai_Ulfsark: i wonder if achievements like "losing your profession" will be able to be completed on your account, solo
[4:10:29] Harai_Ulfsark: these things suck

[4:21:32] chelfx: Vertical sinc  caps your frames to your monitors refresh rate
[4:22:08] s7wede: Vsync makes more difference in FPS games where you need it, but for anything else it just eats processing power for non improved gains. Unless you have some weird budget chinese GPU and massive screen tearing it's not needed
[4:22:09] Harai_Ulfsark: i dont like vertical sync i want ALL the frames i can
[4:22:33] Harai_Ulfsark: its ok my pc cant handle more than 120 fps on wow anyway
[4:23:30] DevoidX: the monitor is the limiting factor. if its 60hz then anything more than 60 fps will ook the same as 60
[4:24:09] Lakatarmen: Are you going for a hunter comp 100% unique apperances?
[4:24:27] Harai_Ulfsark: my monitor is only 60 fps so i cap my games at 80~120 fps on the gpu software
[4:25:09] Lakatarmen: Just spam it xD

[4:38:38] ridankulous: and I have a shit pc
[4:39:45] nyrhalahotep: From a different YouTube video;
[4:39:57] nyrhalahotep: 'Have you noticed the pattern follows the score you sometimes hear in this area? It doesn't always match up but if you remember the tune, it definitely helps and a good reminder not to spam the button if you're lagging or push the button too early.  I used my left hand for the first two buttons and my right for the third button."

[4:41:43] wastedxtime93: You have to aim for it to channel 2 of them at the end when they start flying in faster. You've just gotta get better reaction time I guess
[4:41:44] nyrhalahotep: there are over 70 comments on the wellhead post about this
[4:41:57] nyrhalahotep: wowhead
[4:42:50] nyrhalahotep: from the comments: "It seems like you have to wait until the energy balls are almost to the target before blasting them. If you hit them to far away, the pylon loses health faster for some reason. My husband I managed to both get it with this strategy. It does get dicey at the end, you need quick reflexes when they are all coming at you.
[4:42:57] CloudyHS: if i dont see 10.2.6 news this week i may lose my mind and start scribbling on my walls
[4:43:32] nyrhalahotep: if it's any consolation at all, we feel your pain immensely
