[0:24:45] LumberChopMan: I got the 5 SW cards on my pally by the SW fountain, Ill be in stream so when ever you are around SW I can trade em over. Only have a few meetings today so should be paying enough attention to stream to catch you.
[0:25:42] LumberChopMan: I think I have like 4 sets for SW or something so I can probably spare some more ha
[0:26:03] GNR_SweetSkills: Last night I was drunk playing Palworld and kept hearing static and got pissed because my headset was going out woke up logged realized the static was in game I was just standing next to the power generators  LUL
[0:26:58] LumberChopMan: if you get two guards next to eachother, you stand close to one and turn in to the other that is far away from you. When you do the turn in, the effect that taakes away the ability to turn in to the NPC is applied to the npc you are closer to and you can turn in repeatedly to the npc further away
[0:27:30] LumberChopMan: idk if a bug but its in the game
[0:27:34] LumberChopMan: probably a bug

[0:30:01] LumberChopMan: the only reason for close
[0:30:09] LumberChopMan: is so you can stand by one and interact with the far one
[0:30:24] LumberChopMan: noticed it and have been taking full advantage lol
[0:30:29] LumberChopMan: no idea if others know
[0:31:31] LumberChopMan: I got like 20+ in a row spamming it quickly, not sure if the chance of procing the debuff is bugged when it applies to the npc you didnt interact with.

[0:38:09] StreamElements: Hey Zeegers, I just wanted to take a moment to express some concern to you as a member of your community. I've been following you now for probaby like 7 months, and, I don't know if you know this thing, but I recently loss many, many points in your !dueling system. I'm beginning to feel like I'm not really cared about as a member of your community so maybe I was thinking if you could please help me win something that would be really helpful and maybe make it feel like your stream is good
[0:38:16] Spyke_ZGZ: !spyke2
[0:38:16] StreamElements: @Zeegers The points system on your channel is extremely unfair. I feel like you purposefully have the odds set extremely high just so we'll keep spending all of our points. That makes us have to sit around here longer and watch your "content" to get more points to gamble.
[0:38:25] LumberChopMan: I was gonna trade debuff removals cause my hunter has it too lol but if you already got then ill wait and we can swap if you get the debuff again
