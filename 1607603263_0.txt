[0:40:45] qubilly: what do you think of stealth macros for shred/ravage and maim/pounce?
[0:40:46] Oblivirator: you can set shift and control in macros so you get 3 in one button

[0:44:45] Delthiri: no you get it now that guys retarded
[0:44:45] Karnall: your 4 and shift4 can be in 1 macro instead of 2 bar slots

[0:46:05] gayforcandy: @sodapoppin #showtooltip /cast [mod:alt] Thorns;[mod:ctrl] Soothe Animal; Faerie Fire; there is your macro, because you use faerie fire as E, you've saved a button and nothing changed

[0:46:05] schmeckledorf32: OK SO ITS LIKE YOU HAVE A KEYBIND AS E, but if you hold alt it changes it to something else, and if you hold shift it changes to another thing. all of that is in one single button on your bar
