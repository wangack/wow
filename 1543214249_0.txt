[1:05:29] TweektheProphet: @Towelliee do you have any prediction what we will get this week,
[1:05:39] backerxx: Mage and Warrior have the most datamined abilities, so those seem likeliest
[1:05:45] ahupnatun: mage or warrior this week due to the ammount of datamining being shown i'd guess
[1:05:46] Gutroan: new rounds of invites too for the normal folks right?
[1:05:46] Thoreya: mage warrior seem the most complete
[1:05:48] lucid_wow: max said blizz told him so he could set up his class discussions for them but he wont say which ones they are so blizz can announce themselves
[1:05:48] manmower: DH and monk probably

[1:05:51] athurston: athurston subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months!

[1:05:53] Xaviwan078: 282 ILEVEL Kreygasm !
[1:05:53] jmalmin: FFXIV a better game... guess that depends on who you ask. Both games are good and you cant say FFXIV is bad either. It has a big player base. WoW just feels allot better to play. the movement how abilities work it feels better.
[1:05:55] Xsilentghost: Do we have  to wait all day to get the new build
[1:05:59] ShadoodHD: tbf, they are a day ahead of us ;)

[1:06:29] vulkankragon: wow vs ffxiv, who will win? simple answer: no one
[1:06:30] backerxx: Holy Paladin didn't have any datamined abilities, so I doubt it'll be Paladin. I guess I could be surprised though
[1:06:31] Thoreya: max getting the leaks huh

[1:23:53] Epixil: towelliee opinion on reforging?
[1:24:18] Strixx95: @Towelliee u ever used evlui?
[1:24:21] dragonbard: Do you still even use runeforging with the new system or is it worth it on a dk?
[1:24:31] emznev: @Toddger he always uses it ?
[1:24:36] Trickseynormous: I took a missive shit yesterday
[1:24:38] Mitune: crafter being able to reforge stats would.be a decent community idea
[1:24:41] Epixil: ima be honest this looks complicated af
[1:24:44] LCS01: do you think when dragonflight release, shadowlands will come to standart?

[1:27:06] SpeciousArgument: i hope it wont be like SL legendary crafting where you had to spend crazy amounts of gold to get to a useful level
[1:27:11] Strixx95: @emznev is that  the built in wow ui? cause if so thats not bad
[1:27:12] Jahknowme: that's silly. that's exactly what they complained about when it came to covenants you could not do it all

[1:30:11] Collected1: good to hear
[1:30:15] Korupcija_: yes
[1:30:18] dimofodi: I wouldn't mind being able to be a miner and a skinner and a herbalist etc. Even if they made us only able to choose 1. I'd be alright with that.
[1:30:18] manmower: would give you more to do on all your toons
[1:30:20] Collected1: i just hope they have time to change it
[1:30:21] Architank: @towelliee keep twisting the ear of anyone at Blizzard who can make that happen. secondary professions would be great
[1:30:25] Sollice: multiple gathering yes, multiple creation professions no
[1:30:33] vercetti101: Is fishing getting the same treatment, like be the best Fisherman
[1:30:36] Beggebin: I'd be down for doing FFXIV's system for professions. You can have everything if you take then time to train it call up.
[1:30:37] Alasacy: the way they are doing this alpha cycle feels as good as any beta they have had in the last few years
[1:30:45] mike_the_lord_of_pink: when is new build??
[1:30:50] Architank: Just like the backpack LUL
[1:30:52] Trickseynormous: no lol they have better coding standards now
[1:30:54] manmower: fishing should be primary
[1:30:55] vercetti101: I want to be a fishing GOD
[1:31:00] Kaialita: Maybe mining tied to BS and JC , herb tied to alch and calli
[1:31:01] ialwaysforget7: Irl everyone knows how to cut down a tree.... not everyone knows how to build a house
[1:31:07] Velashen: For the best gathering everyone needs a Druid. No joking.
[1:31:11] dragonbard: I honestly see no reason mining, skinning and herbing could not be secondaries.  It would honestly make sense.

[1:35:35] Holysal: monk will be boring
[1:35:45] Tarryble: i think everyone should be able to participate in every gathering profession, but you have to specialize to craft. it makes no sense that i cant pick up some herds and swing my pick at a deposit at the same time

[1:37:20] xhaven: @Tarryble I does make sense however mining does require some knowledge, herbing as well, same for fishing. I just think blizz needs to make some improvements/changes for the secondary professions along with what they are doing to the primary
[1:37:22] Digidan2005: gonna be an interesting year this year thats for sure

[1:38:37] sliproach: @Razmasbear Turku
[1:38:37] Tarryble: yeah, i guess you're right @xhaven maybe you should be able to opt in to having all and sucking at them/getting less resources from a node or specialize in one and get a lot of resources from a single node. idk lol
[1:38:37] Innex: @mavericks312 I think he is going to kill it over there.. Hopefully he gets a new life..lol
[1:38:41] Innex: Nagy ruined Mitch
[1:38:51] mavericks312: imma say chargers vs bills afc champ game
[1:38:58] wTFologie: @Towelliee What does the Quality stand for on the pieces you craft?
[1:39:02] xhaven: @Tarryble yea even that would be a good idea
[1:39:11] Holysal: @innex was trying to do the same to Fields too

[1:42:59] noosphear: @sobowen Hill is great.  Probably worth 2 points a game to Vegas.  So instead of scoring 31 points a game, the Chiefs go to scoring 28?  Probably going to be ok on offense.
[1:43:02] Razmasbear: Healing is art, dps is dedication but tanking is PASSION
[1:43:04] thymos_: i miss pre nerfed LFR KEKW

[2:05:44] andrejhmm: @Towelliee The closed Blizzard branches in EU and friends and family are mostly NA. There aren't as many EU WoW streamers.  So you are going to be hard-pressed to find Europeans on Alpha.

[2:07:29] Razmasbear: Thye speculated with the release dates..... My bet is in 6th december or 13th december
[2:07:30] BunnyMountain: "the leftovers"
[2:07:45] jmalmin: Maybe its time to give us old accounts access? :D If I do not get Alpha today a chair is going through my screen! I do have 2 more characters to level so I am fine not getting the Alpha at all.

[2:08:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, I think the only range increase would be for the healer
[2:08:35] Didimus85: i just wish i could get a beta inv the only one i ever got was MoP and thats cuz of the 6 month promo they did
[2:08:37] TheCliffyShow: Call me a leftover invite, pity invite, welfare invite. I don't care. I just want in.
[2:08:47] Razmasbear: 26.9 is release and thats my birthday ^^
[2:08:54] Razmasbear: Wrath release, that is
[2:08:54] Ceelottv: well I mean evoker is an "ADVANCED" class
[2:08:56] Robodope: sounds like a dps problem
[2:09:03] Vonsterr: i think they need to change it to be around 30 y at LEAST, unless they really re-work it and make it 40 to compete with not being gimped
[2:09:07] Funderik: maybe that's just their trade off for being such amazing healers.
[2:09:10] Vonsterr: cuz if they change the healer side, they need to do the same with dps i feel
[2:09:11] cookie_jayy: Mele advanced healer
[2:09:13] PToastman: Healers adjust Kappa
[2:09:13] jmalmin: A Evoker has mobility like crazy That is why their heals are 25 yards instead of 40?  They just need to get used to the play style.
[2:09:16] Alienfromger: then you have to adjust your playstyle
[2:09:26] Snabido: @TheCliffyShow And when you login, play for a few days and then go "im done, back to retail" Keepo
[2:09:33] Respls: correct
[2:09:33] SaulMDGaming: I think reach, but the heal isnt as effective
[2:09:36] Funderik: it's what makes them "ADVANCED" lol you have to manage 25yd postioning
[2:09:36] andrejhmm: @Razmasbear GZ Dont play WOW that day.Don't
[2:09:38] flebbooo: MW's fistweave heals are 20 yard range
[2:09:40] Scoodles91: they stay in melee cause of mastery

[2:12:07] mekatok: disco bear is !y favorite
[2:12:40] thenormalbeast: Bear will be nerfed
[2:12:50] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee don't think it's going to be in the bear moonfire ratio category though :D
[2:12:52] iRumm: DK feels more comfy to pull big with IMO

[2:13:41] TombStoneMercenary: what do you feel is the easiest class to get back into tanking with?

[2:16:36] andrejhmm: @Towelliee I just DONT UNDERSTAND why are starter spells for DK now talents? Hope they change that. (INHALE MASSIVE HOPIUM)
[2:16:47] Razmasbear: @sliproach  Thats what i'm afraid of too, Legion bear was fucking raidboss
[2:16:49] sliproach: @Razmasbear no lacerate went into thrash
[2:16:49] thebakeriscomingforu: The guardian tree did seem to have a lot of great talents on the left side
[2:16:54] cabrokz: Yo
[2:17:20] Lasidor: @andrejhmm So you mean, like if you were leveling from the start you would... gain then... as you level...
[2:17:31] thebakeriscomingforu: i'd prefer the talent trees to be less about defense vs offense as you migrate to the bottom and more playstyles.
[2:17:36] schmooplesthesecond: how strong do you think the tier set is gonna be?
[2:17:37] Razmasbear: We did have lacerate AND tharsh in MOP so yes it is possible to have both
[2:17:40] Frank4LuLz: GG
[2:17:45] youngsinatra_x: I can’t understand how they haven’t released more talent trees. There’s no way they’re all balanced In time if only half of them are released at this point
[2:18:19] Thoreya: its been less than 2 weeks of alpha and more than half the classes have talent trees lol
[2:18:22] Thoreya: with more coming today prob
[2:18:24] andrejhmm: @andrejhmm Well Yes, just the first 3. I mean WHY IS GHOUL A TALENT?
[2:18:30] Frank4LuLz: "you no what im saying"," gaba-goll"
[2:18:32] furrythighs: lol your DK name is Boomer, love it
[2:18:34] Mitune: WW monk has been cookie cutter for like 2 expansions now
[2:18:34] Rocman: hell even 4 viable builds isn't cookie cutter
[2:18:42] Kriven: @youngsinatra_x sure there is. they have already been tweaking the ones released due to feedback this way they can focus on a few at a time
[2:18:45] Aggressive_Pear: Interrupts should not be a talent imo
[2:18:49] garbagaha: Do monks have talent trees on alpha yet
[2:18:50] Razmasbear: Now there is possible to have BOTH side capstone talents as guardian, you get 1 point to move around, i damn hope Blizz keeps that
[2:18:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomer blast!
[2:19:01] youngsinatra_x: @thoreya it’s more of the fact that the game is supposed to drop in December
[2:19:08] schmooplesthesecond: i think cookie cutter only exist in mythic raiding and 20+ keys
[2:19:13] Kaydwen: You left gfuel @towelliee ?
[2:19:15] furrythighs: Boomer Blast flavor sounds like something old but we knew was coming lol
[2:19:16] sliproach: @Razmasbear i think they should make maul into a execute
[2:19:21] Kriven: @youngsinatra_x thats plenty of time
[2:19:22] Scoodles91: do they deliver to EU?
[2:19:25] bonkyouded: i miss bfa PoroSad
[2:19:26] Thoreya: @youngsinatra_x u think they need 4 months to release 6 class trees?
[2:19:27] youngsinatra_x: @kriven I guess that’s fair as long as feedback remains to be taken seriously
[2:19:31] Lasidor: Some of yall are hilarious talking about putting starter skills in talent trees, its almost like you would learn them while leveling by putting a talent point in it... Almost... @Towelliee
[2:19:31] Razmasbear: That would work yes
[2:19:39] Nachozdood: so will you have input on this boomer blast flavor or do they say pick a flavor and we will handle the rest
[2:19:43] Pryzmic: I'm so excited for the Fated raids lol

[2:20:08] duffluv22: Is the Vuhdu addon working on Alpha or is that the game UI?

[2:22:52] Lasidor: @Lasidor I mean, any class could have a new ability.  Thats obvious, but the talent trees are going to grow and increase your power from a leveling perspective.  So you are going to learn the as you go, ergo talents.
[2:22:54] UltraKSlaya: I really want Torghast in Dragonflight. I will miss the rogue likelike gameplay

[2:23:18] DeanoTV: @Raioktv they said a new torghast/mage tower is planned later in DF
[2:23:27] GrazzloTV: I hope they keep torghast too and just revert it back to how it was in shadowlands alpha, just go to floor 200 + with a ton of powers.
[2:23:38] Thoreya: evoker has torghast powers lol
[2:23:40] Thoreya: pretty interesting

[2:25:33] northshanks: Yeah. Even working at Blizzard Austin as CS, I felt how slow getting anything changed was.
[2:25:35] Lasidor: @Lasidor Shamans have to spec into all of their totems now, where as most of them were baseline.
[2:25:36] Lothawia: @dv_domino there is a mount like it
[2:25:36] Kriven: @o_illusionz of course they can but it might not be the most effective way to use that money and test the game
[2:25:38] Mitune: I wish Shaman had 5 trees LUL
[2:25:42] cookie_jayy: I WOULD
[2:25:44] ItsGigg: How do you keep death knight tank interesting? I played it for a bit in BFA. I felt indestructible, but it felt boring after awhile because I was never in any danger
[2:25:52] ZabberzTV: @dv_domino i think u can get it but not with the tentacels
[2:25:57] uldrey: mop Beta remember?

[2:26:27] Masqerader: I will get my DF key in 4 years from Panda
[2:26:30] Reckless_Monk: true
[2:26:30] Nachozdood: MoP beta was massive because they gave it to you with a year long sub
[2:26:32] manmower: RNG of active subs
[2:26:43] Jawis: @Gunlove haha, yeah I just thought about it
[2:26:43] Lasidor: @Towelliee All I heard out of that is that you were giving away Alpha keys for the next two hours and now we wait...
[2:26:54] ZabberzTV: yeah ppl are already complaining u cant transmog your proffesion armor XD
[2:27:03] thebakeriscomingforu: This alpha does seem rather polished
[2:27:07] rensdeamo: How can you play - when servers should be down from 7 - 9 ?
[2:27:07] Shalestorm: LMAO

[2:27:31] turfjitsu: @rensdeamo its alpha content
[2:27:34] Reckless_Monk: i thought we got Diablo 3 plus a mount free if we did the yesr sub in cata before MoP
[2:27:40] youngsinatra_x: I’ve been subbed since vanilla and have never gotten a beta :/
[2:27:42] andrejhmm: @Lasidor Exactly. It sucks. But Dk without Death Strike is Classic Warrior lvl o.
[2:27:48] Masqerader: I thought it was pre-order for mop beta?
[2:27:49] Nachozdood: @Reckless_Monk yep and the mop beta
[2:27:50] Masqerader: as well
[2:28:08] rensdeamo: Thought it was Alpha that was down 7 - 9
[2:28:10] cookie_jayy: Im still mad china got a spectral tiger for the promo reward and we get a friken tabard of flame
[2:28:12] zeitgeiz: I cancelled my one year sub and lost D3 but kept the mount
[2:28:15] Reckless_Monk: huh.. guess i forgit @nachozdood
[2:28:26] Razmasbear: I'm kinda puzzled, wow has MANY speell effects going on and stuff on screen but this never causes me NO issues what so ever, light sensitivity is shit to deal with

[2:31:31] Nachozdood: where they fly across and just hard stop as if there was a wall in front of them
[2:31:37] RowanWeir: @abracka_ the best thing about meme beam is if you one shot something theres isnt even a beam, you just look at them and they die lmao
[2:31:44] Razmasbear: Deep Breath
[2:31:46] Abrakadunk: i loved my blood DK, my biggest complaint is the slowness and managing bone armor stacks in M+, has to be like non stop and using pulls

[2:35:43] zackyton: if i wantyed 20 minute boss fights i'd go to ff14
[2:36:03] Lasidor: Just saying, having DH and Evokers Soaring around would be a pretty cool sight.
[2:36:09] Razmasbear: @Towelliee  your favorite and most hated instances?
[2:36:11] furrythighs: furrythighs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Towell, Hows the BD DK currently feel?
[2:36:14] Vonsterr: remember mekkatorque, that was a great fight , no kap
[2:36:21] manmower: how many dragon raids can they come up with?
[2:36:27] Wcvechten: could do 9 as a final tier instead of 8
[2:36:28] Kwurky: Bite sized content is great
[2:36:31] Vonsterr: we need another in DF
[2:36:33] Lasidor: @manmower At least one more.
[2:36:37] Kyrrua: its so funny to see the boosting community of classic in disarray today KEKW
[2:36:37] Nachozdood: Slappy hands looks fun
[2:36:41] thebakeriscomingforu: dungeons shouldn't be long, tedious, or overtly difficult. Should be "fun" since it is content used so much.
[2:36:56] Exoduc: @manmower just 1, and its all galakrond's limbs
[2:37:02] zysmos: i think 10 boss is fine tuning needs to be consistent tho
[2:37:15] manmower: each raid ends with fighting one galakrond limb?
[2:37:16] Exoduc: We'll raid his left toe for a couple months time
[2:37:33] EarlofCockwood: is the dungeon music implemented?
[2:37:39] Pwoahv: SD
[2:37:46] anOceaninadrop: @exoduc LUL
[2:37:49] Razmasbear: I have insane fear of Galakrond fight..... Spine of Galakrond.....? *shiver*
[2:38:00] Ooshraxa: @thebakeriscomingforu yep! I'd be pug-tanking a lot more random dungeons if I knew that I wouldn't potentially run into a 50+ minute experience
[2:38:05] looney199725: ul have alot of dragon raids to deal with each primal
[2:38:26] Lasidor: You know how big Galakrond is going to be?  That in itself will be a marvel to see ingame.
[2:38:29] NVbrutal: heard this dungeon is only gonna be apart of the pre patch event and wont be a M+ dungeon.
[2:38:37] flebbooo: KEKW
[2:38:41] OviTheGray: @Razmasbear cant realy do that.. Galakrond was like 10x bigger than deathwing
[2:38:48] Rottencoarse: RIP CDS
[2:38:49] Kwurky: o7 CDs
[2:38:56] thebakeriscomingforu: @Ooshraxa Same! I've disliked the designs in Shadowlands. Wide open rooms, lots of trash, tedious fights. no thanks
[2:38:57] Ooshraxa: o7
[2:39:13] Bald_Emperor: are they releasing new talent tree today?
[2:39:32] Exoduc: Galakrond so big he has his own gravitational pull

[2:41:06] MR_WYTE: DH last for sure :(
[2:41:06] Kwurky: Paladin is always seems to be one of the last
[2:41:15] Eggz1004: pally would be nice, veru interested in the prot tree
[2:41:20] zorantt: Hopefully they will bring another profession in
[2:41:26] looney199725: chromagus will show up before anything
[2:41:27] TrustyTea: Is the uldaman rework supposed to launch with the prepatch? I’ve heard it was but wasn’t really sure
[2:41:27] raldrik: They are just trying to not piss towelliee off when they take away divine toll.
[2:41:28] OviTheGray: no lore char is gone , even if dead. they will find a way to bring anyone back
[2:41:29] NVbrutal: feel like they have to start releasing 2 a week or were gonna be waiting a month before there all out lol think were still missing like 5 talent trees.
[2:41:35] Phatori: When do servers go down? Shouldn’t they be down alrdy?
[2:41:36] schmooplesthesecond: will the tier set be released on alpha?

[4:00:58] Crowargus: no it s from wq etc like ap
[4:00:58] OviTheGray: or do some daily q
[4:01:02] Waterrmaloon: Would make sence
[4:01:07] atrexy_: Yeah i think so, i think it's a RNG thing
[4:01:08] Sollice: So with DF we will start over on crafting like we have with all recent expansions right? No need to level professions on alts now?
[4:01:14] jimmywatki: wowhead stated they didnt know how knowledge was granted but expected it was from world quests
[4:01:18] Rimasr: Is this the new expansion?
[4:01:18] Lexxania: apparently its still speculation how you actually gain knowledge

[4:01:50] ThQbi: Q for Professions? Is this possible?
[4:01:52] Crowargus: it ap for proffessions thats end grind for those who want it
[4:02:16] gelimarr: @Towelliee did u reviewed talents tody?
[4:02:20] gelimarr: today
[4:02:42] Rabiahtaro132: PP, profession power
[4:02:51] Korupcija_: hopefully 0
[4:02:52] Gotxiko: my guess is some daily quests might be related to professions, like turn ins
[4:03:00] gelimarr: Okay thanks
[4:03:08] Celwind: Better start stacking your mats for all of your professions since the AH will have crazy prices for basic level mats LUL NotLikeThis
[4:03:15] Sleyenda_UK: hopefully warrior fingers crossed
[4:03:21] doomester: @Towelliee looking forward to BrM talent
[4:03:31] gelimarr: I hope for Warlock talents !!
[4:03:31] Gotxiko: hope they bring profession questlines like in legion with blacksmithing and so on
[4:03:46] Waterrmaloon: Would also make it easier to make gold on AH if not all could craft the same
[4:03:49] Crowargus: ima be doing as much as i can on alchy tbh
[4:03:51] atrexy_: i saw that inscriptioon can make those books for knowledge
[4:03:54] TrustyTea: @insanity2195 oh nice thx
[4:03:58] Gothbrud: Just the sun iirc
[4:04:00] Gothbrud: stun*
[4:04:04] cappei: I'm guessing Mage/Warrior today > Paladin next week > Warlock after
[4:04:04] bonkyouded: nothing has been dataminded
[4:04:05] atrexy_: @Towelliee  i saw that inscriptioon can make those books for knowledge
[4:04:06] Rabiahtaro132: I'm guessing at least Mage and pally
[4:04:11] gelimarr: I hope warrior then
[4:04:18] cinamonjackz: Finally got Heroic gavel out of my vault @Towelliee
[4:04:32] ParzTV81: i hope frost mage isnt gonna still be an ice lance spam spec
[4:04:38] Celwind: Oohh, inscription will make an come back then, with the books and what not
[4:04:42] zorantt: @Towelliee I wonder if you get skill points when that crafting details bar fills up?
[4:04:47] Tamz_tv: @ParzTV81 it already isn't
[4:04:55] gelimarr: cooking
[4:04:57] ParzTV81: yes it is lol
[4:04:58] cptrogers123: got 285 gavel on my first progress kill KEKW
[4:04:59] Faerlynn: Elusive gavel, still no luck
[4:05:07] doomkry: i feel weird using gavel as warrior in m+, the cd timer seems kinda too long
[4:05:12] Tamz_tv: nah you play necro single target and mostly just frostbolt
[4:05:12] bonkyouded: you should be able to craft raid buffs again with inscription
[4:05:18] Celwind: Do people still enchant or?
[4:05:27] K_A_N_J_I: Do you think to encourage more world pvp. Blizz can have select areas in zones where pvp is toggled automatically but the resource rarity chance is higher there and like double honor per kill. @towelliee
[4:05:30] JokaThS: @Towelliee what is the pink bar that goes up at the top of crafting ui
[4:05:41] OviTheGray: i know is bugged, but if you right click on your portret and choose "Cast Bar Underneath" will il move it? :)
[4:05:56] gelimarr: Never learned inscription, dnno why

[4:06:11] pedroj632: alchemy trinkets are always busted af
[4:06:17] WoWLeia: some expansions ago inscription used to make staffs @Towelliee  think we will see that in DF ?
[4:06:35] Celwind: My low level priest did inscription and enchanting during Wrath back in the day LUL
[4:06:36] doomkry: are the finishing reagents soulbound?
[4:06:36] pedroj632: at least at the beggining
[4:06:39] gelimarr: Maybe I go inscription for DF
[4:06:42] toobaked1987: Towelliee I saw a Wrath marathon. How much Wrath are you going to do? As soon as DF comes out, its all about retail, right?
[4:06:47] Greybeard_ttv: 523 haste!!! Damn
[4:06:50] nightwolf_87: @Towelliee i dont understand 30 min lock when you take crafting order.
[4:07:09] Celwind: I hear haste, I greed. TPFufun
[4:07:10] zorantt: @Towelliee I wonder if you get skill points when that crafting details bar fills up?
[4:07:17] Greybeard_ttv: resto druid for sure

[4:07:22] Odinslayer: !time
[4:07:22] Moobot: @Odinslayer Towelliee's time is currently 09:09:25 PST
[4:07:30] mashiesmashie: Or people trolling others
[4:07:31] Odinslayer: new build in 50 min?
[4:07:35] pigzip: Bots
[4:07:40] gelimarr: 1 order per 30 min is good
[4:07:47] Celwind: Haste is needed for all spell casters
[4:07:49] Greybeard_ttv: yeah
[4:07:59] Nayllen: just make a captcha to accept work order 5Head
[4:08:02] karter2811: i think it will change and they will find the sweet spot
[4:08:08] PokerFaceMoose: dang robots taking our jobs, even in wow
[4:08:09] Kosen_: 30 mins feels like it'll hurt normal players way too much
[4:08:09] Megadisaster24: maybe add a captcha
[4:08:11] silodin: just make it take effort to make good products, filter out the 0 investment bots
[4:08:15] gelimarr: "check this box if you're human"
[4:08:18] LeGoogs: Even just 5 minutes... Just make it so bots cant rob everything away
[4:08:20] Celwind: Yeah, a lot of people will mulit box again to get all of the work orders
[4:08:24] Revoca: 30min os 2 a hour
[4:08:29] pavepawns: i think 5 work orders every 60 mins seems nice
[4:08:31] manhooties: click all the pictures with dragons in them... lmao
[4:08:32] raldrik: it sucks as a 9-5er only get 1 or 2 done a night in-between M+
[4:08:37] Architank: Catchall would be hilarious 😂
[4:08:38] nightwolf_87: @Towelliee but from the prospective of the guy who makes the order, you dont want people to just select urs and leave. it will take days for it.
[4:08:41] Blankelos: 20 ?
[4:08:45] Architank: Captcha*
[4:08:51] Mecabeast: 278 mist 2h axe for warrior no heroic gavel all tier sadge only have a normal one
[4:08:57] silodin: Gacha in wow? Pog
[4:09:03] gelimarr: You can also set that the orders be done my guildies, nah?
[4:09:11] Kriven: is it a 30 min lockout or 30 mins to complete it?
[4:09:16] nightwolf_87: its needs more testing :)
[4:09:30] HaloS23: @Towelliee is there a time limit on when the work order is taken? like the person has 30-60 min to complete if not the work order is reposted?

[4:29:42] bonkyouded: @Angeius90 not out yet, only datamined
[4:29:51] Zanzarful: They want professions to be one of the main pillars of gameplay similar to m+/raids/pvp sooo
[4:29:52] Zanzarful: makes sense
[4:29:53] PvtHudson093: Gimmie those Jewel crafting Trinkets
[4:29:54] supersegue: oui oui
[4:29:58] darthturtle1031: crafting is tedious by nature
[4:30:07] Karnivor___: crafting should be a mini game...if u dont want to craft dont do it

[4:30:37] ohnot___her: @Fillolo no one knows
[4:30:39] Razmasbear: Dual gathering since start
[4:30:46] Jack_the_Dipper: Problem is that crafting costs a lot of time if you want to make gold from it
[4:30:48] Wolfenhoof: @Jack_the_Dipper if just he gathering wouldn't be such a pain in the ass in wow
[4:30:48] xhaven: @V4NDEL its not out yet
[4:30:49] DAN_I_E_L_: Only worth it to optimize stats
[4:30:51] Jey1h: @PrimeNr23 what do you mean mini game?
[4:30:52] Sluggs_: can also get someone to make it for you through work orders if you dont want to craft
[4:31:01] AxelyuS7: in a few hrs

[4:31:13] Crowargus: ?
[4:31:18] V4NDEL: wait to new crafting is going to be comparable to mythic raiding gear??
[4:31:20] Jack_the_Dipper: @Wolfenhoof Buy the mats if it is profitable :)
[4:31:25] Praetour: @Thondr everything incentivises them now that theyre in the game technically
[4:31:25] Phatori: Is the max ilvl armor going to work like SL? Where you can have only 1 equipped? Or can you craft a whole max ilvl set? @towelliee
[4:31:30] Zanzarful: @Thondr I guess you could argue anything that requires gold in wow to incentivize wow token purchases
[4:31:34] Gezber: not more than previous expansions i reckon
[4:31:46] Karnivor___: @Jey1h I mean some people enjoy crafting just like some people enjoy making deals at the AH all day. I dont like how in wow everyone can do everything
[4:31:50] bukka_hot: LFR quality PogChamp
[4:31:52] Velashen: I would never complain about them giving us more content. Making professions relevant again is a good thing.
[4:31:53] gelimarr: It's good they are testing the proffessions first
[4:31:54] Jack_the_Dipper: Jack_the_Dipper gifted a Tier 1 sub to Zanzarful! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:31:54] Jey1h: I mean people buy wow tokens to buy torghast boosts in 9.2. the dumbest shit i have ever heard
[4:31:58] raye_gaming22: in teorie you can buy boosts
[4:31:59] Horuseternal69: didnt they say the mythic gear could be sold via work orders?
[4:32:07] Jawis: yeah that might be, people probably still enjoy the good old AH shopping
[4:32:11] Zanzarful: @Jack_the_Dipper I see you BOP
[4:32:21] Jack_the_Dipper: @Zanzarful Kappa
[4:32:25] manmower: sorry Fury warriors get 3 total?
[4:32:31] h3ppyboy: is it still worth starting/playing this expansion or just whait for next one ?? asking couse i quit at the begining of shadowlands :D thx for the answer
[4:32:31] Wolfenhoof: @PrimeNr23 Thats not people. Thats TSM. Fucking AH addons.
[4:32:36] Zanzarful: Straight your email KEKW
[4:32:38] Snabido: Work orders be like third party agent?
[4:32:41] gelimarr: gotcha
[4:32:43] Dankind64: i think they mean "sell your craft"
[4:32:52] Balkep: send it to my fax instead Kappa
[4:32:52] Atem___: yeah but whats to stop the crafter from saying I wont craft it for you unless you pay me 500k lets say?
[4:32:57] Horuseternal69: yeah that's still wow token viable though, buy the basic mats and enough gold to pay for your high end bop materials
[4:32:58] Rumbly98: its not that hard to understand
[4:33:00] Praetour: Is there a commission fee the game takes from it like AH cut?
[4:33:01] Rumbly98: lol
[4:33:02] mayonaes: so buy gold and put in work orders for the best gear?
[4:33:03] Kale_Nd: comissions will be over 100k+

[4:33:05] itsNODDERS: basically another auction house for a specific market
[4:33:06] Architank: My worry is that picking a specialization is gonna be like picking a covenant. You can unknowingly make a bad choice and be stuck without the ability to make an easy switch.
[4:33:07] Pachydactyl: how many BoP mats will there be is the main issue with all of that
[4:33:11] brian_777777777: are enchant vellums going to have qualifies

[4:34:23] strchsr: Just casually making millions
[4:34:23] raye_gaming22: we bien there befor in SOD i payed 400k week one for my lego
[4:34:24] zenkodac: if there are people willing to spend 200 dollars in tokens to skip to then end i cant stop them, but im all good if that person wants to ruin their experience by just skipping it
[4:34:26] Sluggs_: by the time you could make mythic gear the race is probably done
[4:34:27] Vaedrun: crafting slaves

[4:34:39] Pachydactyl: they'll have people in the guild happy to do it
[4:34:46] Jack_the_Dipper: @Towelliee Yeah I know 2  gold makers do that and they have like a 700m gold
[4:34:47] zenkodac: people probanly wont be able to craft what they need in time for the race
[4:34:53] Frank4LuLz: vig incoming
[4:34:54] DAN_I_E_L_: Is there any RNG involved in getting the plans etc?
[4:34:55] generaljosh721: 100% are going to recruit crafters
[4:34:59] keeindordel: Liquid: we will pay you to do nothing but focus on blacksmithing for our raid for the tier"
[4:35:02] zenkodac: probably*
[4:35:02] BigJustin26: ya but i'm sure they'd recruit crafters

[4:35:21] hrdstylem: im sure they have players on alpha figuring out crafting
[4:35:29] Praetour: cutting edge and gold for being a guild crafter would be dope
[4:35:30] MILESkg21: full time job crafting LuL
[4:35:34] Greene_Mamba: They’ll have to do it themselves though because you have to supply the high level crafting material
[4:35:35] MrGrimms: @Shuttlelol ohgawd just stop no no no lol
[4:35:42] Wolfenhoof: They have so much money from RMT that they can simply buy every piece of material they need and stuff it into a crafter.
[4:35:43] Lofty916: CRAAAAAFT BatChest
[4:35:43] gelimarr: I want a company mount if Im the crafter
[4:35:43] nightwolf_87: i love the fact there is some PR in the game, people will recognize your name if you are super skilled or owning rare recipes.
[4:35:44] Ojo4: If you spec correctly in Alchemy you can get more effects from potions you use, so their raiders will be forced to craft themselves
[4:35:56] Eaglebrace: looks like this gonna be for me full focus on crafting, i love that stuff - happy they doing the changes

[4:36:07] zenkodac: im see it being a bit like double legos this patch, if the rwf ended in a week and a half no one would have double legos, i imagine crafted gear will be similar in df
[4:36:07] Eaglebrace: this expansion**
[4:36:09] Celwind: Just clean your bank and get your mats stacked up, chat. LUL

[4:36:21] remixonfire91: think that would count as RMT
[4:36:22] Jack_the_Dipper: They already have connections 99% of the time for crafting   because they need gold makers with a lot of gold that can pay for the mats @Towelliee
[4:36:22] ThorH13: that seems againt wow tos
[4:36:23] DAN_I_E_L_: I mean, they pay their players

[4:36:49] LeXieSterling: You are paying them to play the game. They are just playing profess..
[4:36:51] Karnivor___: what if they pay in actual gold
[4:36:51] zenkodac: to play, not to give them loot

[4:37:51] Praetour: Thats reasonable, why should they get boosted by you IRL and you just get some in game currency
[4:37:52] Utmost777: @Towelliee about to create the ACU <Azeroth Craftors Union> local 420
[4:37:55] thenormalbeast: They spent 700 000 000 gold right? how much is that in $?

[4:38:27] Jawis: SUSSY, they know something
[4:38:29] 클라우센: i just quit my mcdonalds job for this wow crafting career PogChamp
[4:38:37] Phatori: Pretty sure it would be against ToS because you’re buying the gear. You can pay someone to play on your team. But to exchange an item would make it RMT
[4:38:40] Praetour: @thenormalbeast 3500 wow tokens at current price but would have been more back then since prices went up
[4:38:40] Celwind: What!?
[4:38:45] Thoreya: @plss_ LUL
[4:38:45] keeindordel: attack speed
[4:38:48] Akermay: Ha, that's MrGM in Halls. Pretty norm.
[4:38:49] Phatori: Max has mentioned this before
[4:38:49] falldrgn: Frenzy?
[4:38:49] zenkodac: gregltv nonever does it for free, for some reason they spend millions and millikns per race in gold, gow would they do that if everyone already gives them everything for free?
[4:38:51] Kolepto: That's definitely new
[4:38:51] drbigbanger: gives them all the attack speed buff
[4:38:52] Sluggs_: barded shot gives attack speed and stacks 3 times
[4:38:52] BigJustin26: i think so
[4:38:54] akia03: frenzy for all
[4:38:54] keeindordel: bbleeding targets enrages ur pets

[4:39:29] Praetour: At least someones doing it KEKW
[4:39:30] raye_gaming22: we allready have 5 guys for our guild to craft stuff and they get a 8/8M boost and a mount (if there is one) for 10.0
[4:39:30] Youredoneson666: did we get any new classes? or build hasn't dropped yet?
[4:39:35] Slesky: barbed shot gives pet frenzy
[4:39:37] zenkodac: mr gm was in islands in seconds from the server being up Kappa
[4:39:46] Gotxiko: better go to a dead place to test secret stuff KEKW
[4:39:51] Eaglebrace: haha i can imagine " i love this expansions " - avoids the expansion contents -  that would be funny
[4:39:52] gelimarr: @chizu_gaming damn, hardcore guild
[4:40:09] raye_gaming22: no KEKW
[4:40:12] game_savi: @Towelliee How will i know if i got alpha access?
[4:40:17] TenThousandJawsWillDrop: SeemsGood
[4:40:23] zenkodac: but thats cool, i dont kkow why that would be bad
[4:40:27] ArcaneMaki: Dallas Cowboy money.
[4:40:28] KrimsonElite: gonna need 6 figures for the expansion length
[4:40:29] Phatori: You can’t pay them. It’s RMT. It would be exchange for in game items
[4:40:31] Thoreya: @game_savi fastest way to know would be to check ur game launcher. Would be there
[4:40:36] dreamwalker213: Chat, we thinking warrior and mage coming out today?
[4:40:42] log_in2: is it worth leveling professions now?

[4:41:07] gelimarr: You just killed that druid
[4:41:19] KarasunoTV: @Towelliee can you barrage as surv?
[4:41:24] raye_gaming22: @Gemmeke we trying our best bieng the top 20-50 since mop :)
[4:41:24] Phatori: @praetour paying for ppl on your team isn’t gaining your character an item. Paying someone to make an in game item for you is RMT.
[4:41:24] Blackicedragoon: Over here waiting on DH talent trees
[4:41:25] Jack_the_Dipper: @partoftheproblem77 For toys, mounts, pets and tmog I would say yes

[4:41:54] Gezber: it's so satisfying to use
[4:41:58] Eaglebrace: @Celwind which spec?
[4:41:59] mayonaes: You are paying them to be a part of your org, you are not paying for the items directly.
[4:42:01] tom_taunts: I miss old stampede
[4:42:07] Slesky: Is stampede even good?

[4:42:30] Praetour: @Phatori Paying them to craft and item vs paying them to be a part of the guild and their role in the guild is crafting which is funded by players sending gold/mats to make items isnt the same by esports logic

[4:43:23] Thoreya: FF fans seething
[4:43:24] Phatori: @praetour blizzard has never followed esports logic. They do their own thing. They don’t endorse the race as an esport. So it still follows their ToS.
[4:43:24] Nillraac: FF andy's are so toxic
[4:43:26] Aaltrix_: I Am a banned Swimming instructor in New world Sadge
[4:43:29] gruntpunch: should be able to ban them from the category all together

[4:43:42] Velashen: People act like we can’t enjoy multiple games. Now chat is going to talk crap on Final Fantasy lol
[4:43:45] Wolfenhoof: @zenkodac its easier to set up bots with an trash-account
[4:43:47] Praetour: @Phatori they'll make an exception 100% if they see it as a breach of their TOS, it would cause too much drama
[4:43:51] Reckless_Monk: yes
[4:43:51] Jey1h: now DK just feels like all the other tanks, sage

[4:44:38] SensationalBanana: Just saying that you don't enjoy FFXIV = talking crap about the game to FFXIV fanboys.
[4:44:41] HighThereBud: Everyone is 100% right on the internet and you should always believe them.
[4:44:41] akia03: your like one of the only streamers that plays every mmo
[4:44:42] danktoastea: danktoastea subscribed with Prime. 
[4:44:45] rensdeamo: Sad - so just because you dont agree with 1-3 streamers - you are banned from rest - too bad
[4:44:53] zenkodac: wilfenhoof yea depends on how blizz does stuff, most top players already multibox just to be able to do all their alts in time
[4:44:53] Touch_the_Reaper: ff14 is great, i personally play wow again and just waiting for next big ff patch before i play it more both are good games for their own reasons
[4:44:53] Praetour: @Phatori scratch that, theyll do a 3 day ban then no rollback after that KEKW
[4:44:54] Velashen: I agree!
[4:44:56] Balkep: how dare you not be playing FF every moment of your life, especially when you have an alpha access to an upcoming expansion in another game Kappa
[4:44:58] Kickstand_: I though it was going to be my "Final Fantasy" then I saw @Towelliee channel
[4:45:00] Phatori: @praetour they haven’t in the past. So nothing says they would change their opinion. The top guilds have alrdy said they aren’t goin to pay money. Cause they know the risk. And probs have communicated with Blizz
[4:45:05] Celwind: My younger brother will be happy, he mains an hunter LUL
[4:45:20] Jey1h: @SensationalBanana and liking wow you are either a shill, "like an abusive relationship" or stockholm syndrome.
[4:45:20] K_A_N_J_I: Hate watching is a thing.  I don’t get it but to each their own
[4:45:24] Molvonos: @rensdeamo There's a very distinct difference between spamming nonsensical bullshit because of bias in every channel you go into versus general disagreement with a streamer, homie.
[4:45:28] Rob3phones: new build up yet?
[4:45:38] SensationalBanana: @Jey1h Exactly. Can't like WoW in 2022!
[4:45:43] Gotxiko: if you get banner it's not because of differenc eof opinions lol
[4:45:50] Metrii: how bout just dont be toxic and dont worry about it
[4:45:51] Deadelus0: @rensdeamo You don't have to agree, but being toxic about it and constantly stirring shit up is not the same as having a constructive conversation
[4:45:54] felixdotb: !WOTLK

[4:45:59] mayonaes: I finally played a BM hunter the other day and realized what I was missing all these years
[4:46:01] Scnozzberry: everyone can liek their own thing without shoving it down other peoples throats
[4:46:04] Phatori: @praetour if they could pay you with the logic you have then they would have dedicated loot traders on staff when personal loot was a thing.
[4:46:05] Lightasaurus: People who think they are being banned for just "disagreeing" deserve twitch wide bans lmao
[4:46:06] TheItalianStallion321: could you imagine how long Asmongold's ban list is? lol kekw
[4:46:06] SensationalBanana: Slooot <3
[4:46:07] Metrii: youre online watching THEIR stream. Your opinion doesnt really fucking matter if they dont ask
[4:46:11] Manabucho: @Towelliee shared ban lists are also affected by channels where viewers can get themselves banned for channel points for fun
[4:46:17] tabd69: no way u have same vivers as max
[4:46:19] haalxd: Here's an idea chat, don't do weird shit that gets you banned

[4:46:20] majorpipoo: !playlist
[4:46:20] tabd69: sloot i can see
[4:46:22] JansonLives: don't be a dick and you won't get banned. fairly simple tbh.

[4:46:28] Pacxster: i know its funny but there is infact a differnece between having a different opinion or jus tbeing fucking annoying :D

[5:28:29] M1sterRook: now
[5:28:41] lucid_wow: whats your beast cleave uptime? that could be a big factor
[5:28:50] lucid_wow: also depends on frenzy stacks/uptime i believe
[5:28:51] Brynhilderr: is that with kill cleave talented?
[5:29:04] kurdan76: buffs
[5:29:05] ijuki: @M1sterRook You have to wait or work for Blizzard. You can even call them ask if you prefer that yourself
[5:29:14] Skittlebeast: @Towelliee is two points into Qa'pla really 100% increaded barbed shot dmg??
[5:29:30] paddystar11: @paddystar11 fair ,ty :D  thought we had a definite timer
[5:29:31] haalxd: 22.55% beast cleave uptime
[5:29:38] TSMballer: You can also check how many multi shots you fire off compared to the other BM hunters
[5:29:48] board4life65: you need to maintain 3 stacks of frenzy for more aoe damage
[5:29:49] Surlybottle: hopefully the new build fixes the gd icons not filling up the action bar buttons
[5:29:52] fraxmm: Last I checked, Kill Cleave still wasn't working.
[5:29:54] mandalakoala: im late to the party of dragonflight but we got old school talents now? holy shit thats sick

[5:30:08] Arendiel_: it's under multishot
[5:30:08] Zuljinra: @Towelliee stomp is the aoe talent
[5:30:20] mario_banshee: Beast Cleave having a 4sec buff expires real fast
[5:30:21] flebbooo: @mandalakoala Yep, one tree for your class and the other for your spec
[5:30:24] fraxmm: Btw, Beast Cleave is in the middle, below Multi-Shot
[5:30:27] Skittlebeast: wowhead says 100, not 10
[5:30:33] Cakeabsorber: @mandalakoala yeah, but rather than minor improvements on our abilities we're kinda choosing our abilities instead
[5:30:39] onionenjoyer_flo: hmm nice Klingon reference
[5:30:56] lucid_wow: beast cleave being 3 points seems really weird
[5:31:00] mandalakoala: thats awesome, thats a much cooler system than previously

[6:09:00] Avinar: I mean we will find out later today so it's ok to wait
[6:09:02] NotAlexIRL: Do we know what the HP values of a level 70 with mostly greens is gonna be?
[6:09:04] Creakydoors: Kappa
[6:09:07] Lasidor: @Towelliee ruin your ability to get insider info to leak one set of specs.  KEKW
[6:09:08] RiptoreCA: I am so confused. KEKW
[6:09:13] OmgItsEdizzle: max is on so inside info must be soon(tm)
[6:09:15] KnsWoW: people have to stop crying.. he's literally telling us by "guessing" all the time
[6:09:16] Syrc0: @Towelliee you could "predict" it cohhTOS
[6:09:17] mrsuflakis: tinker
[6:09:21] brewtank: Deep freeze or no monkaHmm
[6:09:21] OmgItsEdizzle: he never on this early
[6:09:33] brewtank: Give me deep freeze or give me death!
[6:09:34] Tizbit: why dont they just release the completed trees when rdy? whyd they swap to just waiting for the alpha build ;c

[6:10:37] Dinermoe: 500K ???
[6:10:42] NotAlexIRL: i think its in every company's interest to do healthy amounts of leaking, as leaking just gives a lot of free publicity
[6:10:51] strike879: its kinda like ''honey does my ass look fat in this pants'' you really need to watch your wording
[6:10:59] zenkodac: 98% crit XD

[6:11:18] PokaSword: is advancedgg available in the uk? and do you have a referral link or code?
[6:11:29] ekologiisk: @tizbit they release fewer classes at a time so they can focus more time on them individually
[6:11:34] BigHeroSixy: TBH im surprised we can still login to alpha but I dont remember when it went down last week.
[6:11:37] ArcaneMaki: Yeah lol everybody knew but still we like to act like we don't know. Make great content.

[6:12:21] manmower: monks are already a superhero class
[6:12:24] NotAlexIRL: im looking forward to demon hunter, i feel like thats a class that benefits way too much from the new talent system
[6:12:26] mavericks312: warriors arent popular lol
[6:12:27] BigHeroSixy: But monk is popular in my heart PoroSad
[6:12:27] Tizbit: guess its warr and mage ;c

[6:13:21] Aidler: @pokasword should be available in the UK. only Sweden, Norway, Finland, Netherlands and Germany are out.
[6:13:25] Parduke: MrGm right above you
[6:13:27] LeDerpski: they wont
[6:13:28] cappei: I'm guessing Demon Hunter is last. Guy who makes the tree said it'd be a while, and it's not like he has a lot of old talents/effects to pull from. Has to make up a lot of new stuff, I feel like
[6:13:31] NotAlexIRL: just give it to multiple classes
[6:13:31] Avinar: mage and balance druid are all I play so I wanna see what they did to mage
[6:13:33] EthicalHermit: They really need to get Prot Warrior right, so giving it more time to test makes sense

[7:40:02] BunnyMountain: just like halo
[7:40:02] Araphas: BF4 was better in some ways than BF3 but BF3 is my favorite
[7:40:06] Nerendis: I love battlefield WW1 and WW2. Still playing them. But I have 0 interest in the new games.
[7:40:07] Masqerader: For me, they killed it with specialist and maps way to big and too many vehicles
[7:40:11] Shrenko: @Highhvoltage21 haha same

[7:42:05] BTiZZY_: your always gonna have people who play cod but it’s way less popular now than it was the past two years @emznev
[7:42:06] Appalapppa: How do you think the new crafting and professions will work if we still can by unlimited amount of gold. I feel like the economy is still going to be bad . Thoughts?
[7:42:08] WayneG947: its the next evolution of flying though
[7:42:08] manmower: are they gonna let dragons fly upsidedown?
[7:42:11] ElDrakenMan: @Towelliee im curious what race is your mage?
[7:42:20] emznev: @BTiZZY_ Yeah true
[7:42:21] Mr_Arson: dragon riding is casual bait, it'l be fun but its not long lasting content
[7:42:24] UltraKSlaya: Torghast is my fav addition to the game. after playing it for 12 years
[7:42:27] Myrror: i really want to see the level 70 day to day, once we are in raid and dungeons the dragonriding wont matter that much, just getting to that content
[7:42:31] thebakeriscomingforu: if the class talents and playstyles are not fun, and the dungeons are not fun, then it won't matter how good Dragon riding is.
[7:42:36] manmower: it's the title of the expansion
[7:42:37] HotFlakesTom: Yep.  I'm the same.

[7:43:19] 2NextLvL: no dragonriding in arena's... so kekw
[7:43:36] WindTotem: Imagine if Blizzard added intertia and weight to our characters. So turning as a heavier character would be slower. xD
[7:43:36] manmower: it also has fighting dragons and dragon bankers
[7:43:37] Masqerader: a blue boe
[7:43:38] ZonnyArk: talents are the biggest thing for me
[7:43:40] Masqerader: np
[7:43:40] HotFlakesTom: 100%!  I'm so looking forward to the talents lol

[7:43:55] Masqerader: LOL
[7:43:56] raphelio: why is the only dragon mount the custom one ????????????
[7:44:09] thagalvir: the system is also gonna be a funny way to get us into pathfinder in 11.0 when we have a ground mount that customizes in the same way and makes movement super wierd
[7:44:15] mavericks312: @Nachozdood plagued proto was up today for 4.6 mill
[7:44:16] arzak: because of talent tree wanna play dragoinfligjt
[7:44:29] DestinamueGaming: well i never liked the cata talent system
[7:44:33] sliproach: some one call thast guy a ambulance
[7:44:49] Mr_Pennywise_: his a ambulance
[7:44:59] Daikanatv: same guy as last time @Towelliee when you mentioned someone stroking in chat
[7:44:59] Sielu11628: There's 5
[7:45:04] SebashtianTV: there's one more that hasn't been released yet
[7:45:08] Sielu11628: Datamined a 5th one. "Serpent"
[7:45:21] Appalapppa: I think they need to change mining and skinning the leveling system is kinda useless
[7:45:24] sshadeh: accountwide Kreygasm
[7:45:33] ZonnyArk: are the glad mounts and mythic mounts gonna be new dragons?
[7:45:34] SebashtianTV: Think Heart of the Aspects mount, but HD and customizable. And yeah, it is dragonriding.
[7:45:35] OviTheGray: @Sielu11628 shop mount one?
[7:45:37] HotFlakesTom: It does make me wonder if they will do a 'special' dragon as a drop from a boss or something.
[7:45:41] OGXanos: I'd expect 1-2 more for sure
[7:45:46] WindTotem: I got the impression that you picked your color/dragon aspect early on
[7:45:48] Sielu11628: https://twitter.com/keyboardturn/status/1550448012865875968?s=21&t=NIFcxk1CV4GMvj3KaSPsoQ
[7:45:53] Appalapppa: That would be sick
[7:45:55] Mr_Pennywise_: cohhFee
[7:46:02] manmower: dragons that can dive and swim underwater
[7:46:08] mavericks312: you wanna start a riot huh lol
[7:46:09] paradoxyy: Fck the casual dawgs
[7:46:10] ThQbi: The Gladiator Dragon looks very nice
[7:46:11] Aidler: in the end you have 4 dragon slaves Kappa
[7:46:14] Appalapppa: I mean they have galdiator mounts already
[7:46:17] Appalapppa: so why not add more
[7:46:22] Masqerader: @manmower so a seahorse
[7:46:26] BearOfLight: as a casual player, it only makes sense to make some dragonriding mount rewards
[7:46:43] jcrozz: I agree! Awesome idea bro!
[7:46:49] OviTheGray: maybe the5th one is black and you get it from Ebonhorn/Wrathion
[7:46:50] Appalapppa: dont worry for casual players they can buy some sick mounts from the store lol
[7:46:50] BTiZZY_: they should 100% add rare dragon skins or something from bosses
[7:47:00] paradoxyy: No cuz 7 is already co nfirmed @Towelliee  3 glad mounts for sure
[7:47:07] ZonnyArk: Aware
[7:47:08] Texas_Mizfit: i thought each zone had their own dragon you can dragonride
[7:47:08] strike879: as long as its not removed after dragonflight if its like normal mythic boss mounts 100% current 1% as legacy
[7:47:11] xziyn: Probably will be a Chinese dragon themed one though, would be weird not to
[7:47:15] raphelio: @Appalapppa gladiators get armor to add to their dragon
[7:47:21] manmower: is dragonriding gonna hurt mount sales on store if they can't dragon ride them?
[7:47:24] thagalvir: is the glad its own mount or is it custom options to the other mounts?
[7:47:24] OGXanos: Nah this year will be dragon mount armor and snoots
[7:47:27] raphelio: its not a mount of itself
[7:47:33] AxelyuS7: what dungeon is this?
[7:47:33] jkitchin75: hope so
[7:47:54] Sielu11628: https://twitter.com/DrBrnr/status/1550966791098302465?s=20&t=8Z4yIiB219laBgP9OcBw6Q

[7:48:07] Rudric_Ice: got tired of alpha tow ? LUL
[7:48:09] Appalapppa: thats cool
[7:48:10] OGXanos: For just 1 easy payment of 19.99 you too can have a drippy snot snoot on your dragon!
[7:48:28] Appalapppa: I hope they do something like that for keystone masters @raphelio
[7:48:29] Rudric_Ice: oh

[7:48:59] HotFlakesTom: Why do I get the feeling that the paladin talents will be last? :P
[7:49:00] raphelio: @Appalapppa im sure they will
[7:49:23] Dankind64: can you tell if you're flagged on the bnet website?

[7:52:13] SebashtianTV: Agreed. It makes sure that the bugs that need catching are caught in that focus area. I do however think they need to have a larger testing group (at least 1000 to even start with) to make sure even those clandestine bugs can be weeded out.

[8:12:50] Moobot: @KridenTagg ALPHA PHASE 3 TODAY - Dracthyr Starting Zone/Waking Shores (60-63) - Maybe New Dungeon/Class Talents? | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[8:12:51] Zilberg: I liked Emerald Nightmare tbh
[8:12:55] gelimarr: just got back, servers offline?
[8:12:56] xziyn: Didn't they get nerfed just before too?
[8:12:58] Appalapppa: I just wanna see fury warrior be up their in dps for a exp
[8:12:59] strike879: if a class is 0.2% worse its getting called trash so just play what you want
[8:13:00] Appalapppa: thats all I ask
[8:13:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think RWF used a prot warrior in season 1 Shadowlands for one boss
[8:13:04] Masqerader: for my rtts, I got drafted by baltimore, traded to yankees, for some reason after hitting like 30 hrs and 90 rbis, was traded to tampa who then beat the yankees in the playoffs and we won the world series, fun times
[8:13:11] strchsr: @Whodabaws Warriors need to be supported by their team to truly excel
[8:13:17] kritteykat: truth
[8:13:22] BigJustin26: prot pally > all
[8:13:23] whodaboss_: World first players are not the best players, people with 100% parses have generally more skill with a specefic class. Tier lists are destroying this game, thats why people wont take warrior tanks. Nothing is wrong with them though.
[8:13:24] Thatshostile: DH?
[8:13:42] kritteykat: its kinda like play meta or just push ur own key if u wana play nonmeta
[8:13:43] fistofnature: whats stigma?
[8:13:43] gelimarr: 975 attempts wow
[8:13:44] Aidler: what if the winner of a free for all pvp fight had a 100% drop chance on Nalak?
[8:13:44] gairefear: Warriors are just beef with no magic, every other class is beef with magic. You choose.
[8:13:44] Cetraben: MoP??
[8:13:45] whodaboss_: Agreed. bad stigma (tier lsits) ruin the game for any class thats not on it
[8:13:52] Revoca: I wish prot paladin got more time in the sun
[8:13:53] OGXanos: If tank class is brown, it's going to fall down KEKW
[8:13:53] thagalvir: my warriors have been fury since bfa
[8:14:00] Masqerader: TD tanks in season 4
[8:14:01] Vile_: ??? Wasn't the first two patch kite meta for M+??? That wasn't fun as tank at all
[8:14:02] gelimarr: MoP prot warrior was soooooo goood
[8:14:05] Masqerader: everyone felt good
[8:14:11] whodaboss_: Wrong faire ignore pain is magic and spell reflection is not only a reflect but HGUE dmg mitigation on only a 20sec CD
[8:14:13] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: c'mon bears are way behind @Towelliee
[8:14:32] Architank: @gairefear This why I keep saying warriors need more beef to compe sate for the lack of magic.
[8:14:32] toobaked1987: Towelliee I thought we were only waiting until 1 today?
[8:14:34] Pr1m0x21: MoP was genuinely good
[8:14:43] strchsr: @Towelliee So did you level all these during the xp buff before Shadowlands and was it for an event or something?
[8:14:44] gelimarr: MoP was idd the best expac
[8:14:57] Aidler: @pr1m0x21 true
[8:14:58] Masqerader: the funny thing is if u look at IO all classes are pretty much viable up to 25
[8:15:06] Masqerader: and in reality 20s is fine
[8:15:13] aistahh: Change prot tier piece to 2set Revenge reduces the CD of Thunderclap by 1 second per mob, 4 set Shield Slam has a very high chance to use revenge. Man that could be fun
[8:15:13] Ordicos: like disc priest was king in castle for Sofo they were holy and no disc priest
[8:15:34] toobaked1987: Excited for the Wrath marathon, even though I thought that expansion was trash.
[8:15:34] strchsr: @Towelliee Just level 50 characters to 60 in less than a week ez
[8:15:34] luckfore: 50 boosts LUL
[8:15:35] Takeadat: @Towelliee New here, sorry if you have answered this already. When do you think Prepatch will drop? heard rumors wanted your take.
[8:15:40] LearnedSomething: I got all classes to 60 and all allied races to 60 for heritage
[8:15:41] Zilberg: I have 13 60's so I am alright at the moment
[8:15:42] gairefear: There was a post on wowhead about dragonflight stuff and changes this alpha build, including customization and skills
[8:15:51] LearnedSomething: to 50*

[8:16:12] TheAzkl: does DF have a set date to release yet or when do we assume it will come out?
[8:16:13] gelimarr: you are the best week
[8:16:23] Architank: Is that prediction?
[8:16:24] Phoenixfiend: oh you're on priest sorry
[8:16:24] Zilberg: I mean the patch 9.2 was 6 months ago
[8:16:30] Lasidor: All classes released today! Chaos ensues! @Towelliee
[8:16:34] Kasvot_Vaxt: Kappa
[8:16:37] mavericks312: or possibly delayed
[8:16:43] gairefear: Wtb 3 class trees this week
[8:16:44] Phoenixfiend: I thought it was warlock and something else lol
[8:16:46] Masqerader: they should release it new years ever
[8:16:46] GroovyBryan: with Wotlk coming out soon, there isn't going to be time for much. lol
[8:16:48] manmower: they'll reveal Gladiator Stance Dracthyr
[8:16:51] Masqerader: *eve
[8:16:55] Masqerader: just to fuck with everyone
[8:16:57] Tayve_: What was the SL date, like 12th December or something
[8:17:07] Zilberg: They want to release before Christmas... More sales
[8:17:09] MOLAR305: 20 gifted subs if the mount drops on this attempt
[8:17:15] gelimarr: same
[8:17:21] mandarinetip: s4
[8:17:23] KrimsonElite: 20 gifted subs if mount drops
[8:17:24] Lasidor: Wait, is Max looking at a Monk tree?
[8:17:26] gelimarr: preach
[8:17:26] KrimsonElite: got you
[8:17:29] Pr1m0x21: Damn
[8:17:30] Masqerader: @Towelliee you getting ninja turtles august 30th?
[8:17:31] goblinknows: based
[8:17:42] gairefear: @lasidor fake monk tree, fan made
[8:17:45] gelimarr: based
[8:17:48] goblinknows: hot take: i think wotlk classic will burn out quicker than tbc
[8:17:49] Lasidor: ah
[8:17:57] Zilberg: I wonder what they will do at the end of Wraith though.. No shot they do Cata Classic
[8:17:57] Masqerader: cowbunga collection
[8:18:02] Masqerader: the OG games
[8:18:06] thagalvir: for sure
[8:18:09] Pr1m0x21: Yep
[8:18:10] FlyLikeAnAngel: yup agree
[8:18:15] Lasidor: Theres a new TMNT game that just came out and then theres the collection of all the old ones from back in the day
[8:18:16] gelimarr: true
[8:18:16] strchsr: @Towelliee What if they just don't update GearScore lol
[8:18:24] emznev: no lfd is dumb
[8:18:28] Zilberg: Yeah not having LFG for solo players.. Is gonna suck
[8:18:28] ditaern: the one coming out in August is a collection of all of the old games + arcade games.
[8:18:40] MrTerkyMan: GDKPs are so goofy

[8:18:46] Dkgungo: phase 1 wont be popular then phase 2 they will make major changes and people will come back for ulduar
[8:18:50] thagalvir: the buffs for naxx seem lacklister
[8:19:09] enux337: might go back to retail after max level on wotlk
[8:19:16] 00birdhouse: I made so much gold off gdkp runs in 25 ICC
[8:19:18] iRumm: Ulduar at least had the hard mode options
[8:19:22] Crisis88: It also had one of the most well known enemies to fight
[8:19:24] iRumm: had a choice to make it harder
[8:19:26] Tayve_: I think Wrath is gonna just be fun for nostalgia reasons, not massive gameplay differences or anything
[8:19:49] Masqerader: @Towelliee cowabunga collection is august 30th, its like the OG ninja turtles games on nes/snes and shit
[8:19:51] Dkgungo: i think they should straight up make a heroic mode for naxx and ulduar and make it insanely hard
[8:19:55] xRaZoNx: wrath pvp was nice
[8:19:58] emznev: classic + more like classic -
[8:20:01] gairefear: No classic content is really hard, just sometimes buggy
[8:20:05] Zilberg: Arthas will always be the best boss in WOW imo.. Just because of who he is
[8:20:23] manmower: aren't they trying to add seasonal stuff to Wrath?
[8:20:24] Pr1m0x21: When will they launch fresh servers?
[8:20:25] thagalvir: phase 2will probably spike but I think everyone will oneshot anything that isn's a hard dps check
[8:20:30] Diamondead1: i dont think so, more people are playing wrath private servers than any other
[8:20:31] Moobot: ezizq8i, Just for the time being we will be automatically removing any "Pay to Win" comments regardless of context to clean up chat. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[8:20:31] Rumbly98: more people remember wrath too i think
[8:20:31] Daarksyde: will they do a classic of the classic? lol
[8:20:40] goblinknows: the hardest part about Wotlk raiding is not falling asleep at your desk
[8:20:44] notColt45: Phase 1 wrath is gonna fall off hard becaues of Naxx for too long, most likely
[8:20:51] gelimarr: but what after wotlk
[8:20:57] Zilberg: Don't stand in fire goblinknows LUL
[8:20:58] Dkgungo: phase 1 is gonna be the best time to level all my alts
[8:21:01] Nevindaz: and after catalcysm classic POGGERS
[8:21:05] Pr1m0x21: @gemmeke cata
[8:21:11] westelan_: "world of warcraft 2"
[8:21:12] Masqerader: my favorite part of the end of iCC is the shitbags who will be like... ICC is gonna take like a week to die and it will be over in 30m
[8:21:13] Daarksyde: @Gemmeke they will do a Classic for the Classic
[8:21:15] Nevindaz: Sadge
[8:21:15] gelimarr: Dragon souls poggers
[8:21:17] cappei: Nothing after Wrath is worth revisiting. Hopefully they just add content to Wrath
[8:21:21] MysticRaven_: cant wait for classic to catch up to retail and be retail vs retail
[8:21:22] mavericks312: cata remastered is what you mean lol
[8:21:24] UltraKSlaya: Cata was Lit
[8:21:25] Dkgungo: classic 2.0
[8:21:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: HE KNOWS
[8:21:30] abracka_: classic+ towCopium towCopium towCopium

[8:21:37] KrimsonElite: they're gonna do new content after wrath
[8:21:37] thagalvir: have they done testing of the hardmode heroics?
[8:21:38] RzaShaolin: French Vanilla
[8:21:38] manmower: they're cutting off Classic before gladiator stance
[8:21:40] Zilberg: WOW 2.0.. Where Arthas actually doesn't get sent to the Maw POGGERS
[8:21:43] gelimarr: he knows confirmed
[8:21:45] schmooplesthesecond: classic dragonflight
[8:21:46] Masqerader: End of Wrath the Men in Black show up, flash their pen and we wake up in MOP @Towelliee

[8:21:51] OGXanos: WoW AU
[8:21:54] Myrror: i want mop classic but in my head i know it will never happen
[8:22:04] CommanderKrano: "What if Cataclysm never happened" Keepo
[8:22:04] goninjakill: ulduar was money
[8:22:05] enux337: i think they are gonna focus hard on retail after wotlk
[8:22:09] gelimarr: 977 attempts
[8:22:11] HeatherJC83: @Awesm_mossm weak auras?
[8:22:14] Rumbly98: arthas deserved better
[8:22:21] MysticRaven_: WoW ducks of azeroth classic
[8:22:24] Awesm_mossm: @heatherjc83 thank you
[8:22:25] Dkgungo: i think we will go back to classic but they will add new content and start the cycle over again
[8:22:26] Broomba: when did alpha servers go down?
[8:22:29] Pr1m0x21: @myrror it might blizzard will do anything for cash grab
[8:22:34] Zilberg: Arthas did nothing wrong but have the bigger sword
[8:22:44] manmower: m+ in wrath
[8:22:44] gelimarr: mount will drop on attempt 1012

[8:22:57] captiv8: Like retail lol
[8:22:58] Nevindaz: warmane pservers Kappa
[8:23:00] strchsr: WoTLK M+ dungeons
[8:23:00] manmower: alternate timeline that merges with retail?
[8:23:01] NinjaChane: like Ruby sanctum lol
[8:23:01] thagalvir: exploring the nerubian empire and the san'layn afte lich king death
[8:23:04] Crisis88: If they added content to classic it would be nice
[8:23:07] WayneG947: isnt that what the classic lead said in the interview with Ion and that other blokr
[8:23:07] Nerendis: I think they are gonna restart with classic honestly. But with like a billion changes.
[8:23:08] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[8:23:09] Toon_irl: would be sick if they made more content like osrs did
[8:23:11] Architank: A world without the jailer? but that's impossible Kappa
[8:23:11] this_reformed_bird: Hey everyone is alpha down atm ?
[8:23:14] GroovyBryan: don't tease me towlie
[8:23:20] gairefear: More than just the lich king? Them is big words
[8:23:22] cahoots82: Tuskarr!
[8:23:23] xziyn: The scrapped Nerubian raid could be cool
[8:23:26] RagingPunk: hopefuly df is so good u wont need any more classic
[8:23:28] MOLAR305: the man KNOWS!!!!
[8:23:30] Zilberg: I want to see Deathwing flying over random zones killing everyone again Towelliee POGGERS
[8:23:30] gelimarr: sheeesh
[8:23:31] finleypark: they could actually finish a story line for once
[8:23:31] strchsr: @Towelliee Imagine if they actually made that Zul'Drak raid
[8:23:32] finleypark: ....
[8:23:33] TopBoyInnit: Hmmm spill it towel! You know something
[8:23:37] OGXanos: ...NERUBIAN ZONE
[8:23:40] PandeyWOW: Classic+ leak? POGGERS
[8:23:41] Nerendis: Wotlk troll raid
[8:23:41] MysticRaven_: Tali will prob be hoping for more Tuskar classic content
[8:23:43] manmower: Varian is still alive
[8:23:43] CommanderKrano: imagine two new raids for the unused portals in the dragon temple
[8:23:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: towCopium
[8:23:47] thagalvir: also undead invasions where bolvar dies at wrathgate and no one can take the crown
[8:23:49] gelimarr: more titan constructs
[8:23:50] Rumbly98: are they gonna do an osrs type of deal
[8:23:53] mavericks312: wasnt there like 2 raids they scrapped
[8:23:54] Tayve_: haha
[8:23:56] raye_gaming22: the scaped aziol nerub i was about to say it
[8:23:57] Lasidor: I think the Devs were not all on board with sundering the world with Deathwing.  This is their abiliaty to have it both ways and progress WoW in a different way.
[8:24:04] Kneckt: what are we here for tea and biscuits? Spill the beans already Kappa Kappa
[8:24:05] DoubleNova: They should do a What If... style thing
[8:24:11] Myrror: but that makes me now want them to finish WOD and no one would be on board with that
[8:24:11] Pr1m0x21: Tali has been working with classic team also I see Kappa
[8:24:16] Xtops: wait, still farming mount ? crazy
[8:24:18] Nevindaz: dude warmane has 4 servers of wotlk for like 6+ years .. and they still have a lot of players..
[8:24:22] Zilberg: Like what if the Lich King doesn't lose?
[8:24:25] thagalvir: they should make a nerubian version of deepholm
[8:24:40] roodenburgertje: They should do somehing more with azjol nerub
[8:24:42] mavericks312: oh retail will flip tables lol
[8:24:44] finleypark: they could add the same story lines to both, its not like nrothrend doesnt exist in retail
[8:24:46] Alepouditsa: it will give them reson to play both
[8:24:48] common_taco: but....I want to go back to the Vindacaar
[8:24:49] MysticRaven_: but then its another game they get for free to play
[8:24:50] Nerendis: That’s why they will never do classic+
[8:24:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: what will a retail andy be called?
[8:24:52] necralia: thats true LUL

[8:25:01] Nevindaz: KEKW
[8:25:02] MOLAR305: the arthas afterlife
[8:25:05] gairefear: It would be really cool if they did classic -> tbc -> wotlk in order and repeated, but then added more to the story each season with original content
[8:25:07] Crisis88: They could add the content to retail, it just wont be worth doing since low tier gear
[8:25:07] mavericks312: lol candies can have this torture to
[8:25:10] Nevindaz: ALL BCUSE THE JAILER Kappa
[8:25:14] CommanderKrano: Shadowlands classic
[8:25:15] HeatherJC83: towPog
[8:25:16] thagalvir: the lich king kills us all and we have to fight the jailer
[8:25:20] Zilberg: And then we are stuck in Shadowlands on retail and Classic KEKW
[8:25:24] Llamatude: hmmm check for updates is greyed out now..
[8:25:28] illStefan: where would you rank shadowlands in best and worst expansions @Towelliee ???

[8:25:34] luckfore: maw walker, korthia awaits
[8:25:47] Nevindaz: The Jailer planned all the bad things
[8:25:51] gelimarr: WoW 2.0
[8:25:55] SirSquaggles: that would be PogBones
[8:25:55] notColt45: Multifverse Pog
[8:25:57] fooxytv: jailer cinematic happens lol
[8:25:59] Crisis88: WoW: Multiverse!!!
[8:26:00] GroovyBryan: The jailor comes down and kills Bolvar and takes the crown
[8:26:00] HotFlakesTom: Wow that would be sick!
[8:26:00] cappei: Give Wrath the OSRS treatment
[8:26:02] Llamatude: can we get the cut content from WOD
[8:26:03] Jinx1348: Wrath++
[8:26:04] gelimarr: Multiverse of WoW
[8:26:07] Icemanbaird: Do a WoW what if..? lol
[8:26:10] procyon_mfc: always liked this song
[8:26:11] finleypark: EXPLORE SINDRAGOSA QUESLTLINE in wrath and now in dragonflight
[8:26:14] gairefear: Wow 1.5
[8:26:17] MTCason: Is anything after Wrath really worthy of being considered 'classic'?
[8:26:26] Nerendis: I just can’t see classic having content unavailable to retail.
[8:26:32] tebbix: Stop it
[8:26:36] board4life65: Nerubian city plz
[8:26:36] DoubleNova: I wouldn't mind playing Legion again
[8:26:36] Zilberg: Can we delete pandas though? and bring MOP remastered?
[8:26:39] luckfore: id be down for mop/legion
[8:26:41] ThaOriginalGamester: Cata was classic to me towCopium
[8:26:41] manmower: Shadowlands Reborn
[8:26:44] lekkahdh: AP grind again? :O
[8:26:46] Dkgungo: i would honestly play cata again though i still had alot of fun in cata
[8:26:46] strchsr: @Towelliee Warlords of Draenor Reimagined
[8:26:47] kargamel: hey towelie did u get other mop world boss mounts?
[8:26:49] Broomba: classic will be renamed chromie cata, chromie, mop, etc
[8:26:50] verdant85: Nuke everything and back to Vanilla
[8:26:51] BunnyMountain: shadowlands repackaged
[8:27:03] Tayve_: I wonder what the uptake would be for a "cata classic" I can't see it being popular
[8:27:05] DoubleNova: Shadowlands Classic anybody?
[8:27:06] gymhalpert: Use the multi-verse and bring in Marvel and Harry Potter
[8:27:11] gelimarr: coowl
[8:27:14] Strugl3snugle24_: I can't wait for BFA classic
[8:27:19] roodenburgertje: that would be awesome
[8:27:19] Korupcija_: sounds dumb, just play retail then
[8:27:20] board4life65: LETS GOOO! yes
[8:27:20] Xtops: imho,.. they should make snapshots of all classes shortly before the next content patch rolls in. why? use it to not allow overgeared ppl run old content. archievments become bigger Epeniz
[8:27:20] CommanderKrano: classic already has content unavailable on retail. the ZA raid, etc
[8:27:21] Zilberg: Shadowlands... Restorylined with 9.3 POGGERS
[8:27:22] CCG_337: copium

[8:35:15] thagalvir: they have to make up new spells and talents for dh or combine their spec trees
[8:35:16] Lasidor: DH is going to be the hardest to make truthfully, it has minimal history to build a tree and their two specs are so different that the general tree will be hard to build as well. @Towelliee
