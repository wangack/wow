[2:01:43] al_capow: like you as hunter would be best tbh
[2:01:48] al_capow: everyone else on boss
[2:01:53] foolsendit: if you or a boomy kill bombs its cake
[2:02:24] reklebin: bombs only 300 health
[2:02:50] al_capow: you can burst them with arcane
[2:03:19] Anhak: sometimes ppl like pet taunt in p1 but i think we try to not use that
[2:05:14] al_capow: fap second phase when ice aoe is going out

[2:18:28] al_capow: you might clutch it
[2:21:03] ghuevo: normally a boomie does them, they one shot spam them
[2:21:05] krome2dadome: If you have enough ranged dps/healers (at least 6), having each one assigned to a different pillar and ready to react in case their specific one gets activated will minimize the total amount of chaos and bombs spawned. (from wowhead)
[2:21:16] ghuevo: as a hunter is kinda annoying being on bomb duty
[2:21:22] Stewjob: meta warlocks and druids are best for bombs
[2:21:38] sotien02: ovarall dps is kinda low aswell

[4:13:44] Szain3: DinoDance
[4:14:55] riece_: trap launcher is such a heinous rune
[4:15:11] FoxiekittenWoW: im not sure, i heard raiku talking about holding down some macro so if you do get knocked you are instantly back
[4:16:40] riece_: I think it's way too strong
[4:16:42] riece_: in pvp
[4:17:33] riece_: you can just frost trap + explosive trap
[4:17:38] riece_: every bg is just covered in frost traps
[4:17:49] riece_: yea'
[4:18:07] riece_: the arming time being so low is completely disgusting also, you can literally just trap launch freezing trap people's cast
[4:20:51] austin_545: @FoxiekittenWoW if you have a press and hold macro set up (either in game or with a mmo mouse software) you can bind glide to it and press and hold. while youre on the ground it does literally nothing but if youre in the air at all (like a knockback) it will instantly use it.
[4:21:38] wowsuomi: 3 day resets starting tues

[4:25:02] Shablagoosh: im kind of afraid this is gonna be the meta for s4 too
[4:25:10] Shablagoosh: like shadowlands s4 was for fury and dh back then too
[4:25:22] zachgamegodx: how good are you at it now
[4:26:04] austin_545: what classes could you play that would bring the most comp flexibility to your team? @notmes
[4:27:02] Anhak: if we assume no changes DH would be worth getting reps in if we assume it gets gutted then what warrior? pally?
[4:27:15] austin_545: could you queue DH ele with sam? or DH ele with trill on dh and you on ele?
[4:27:57] Devcomz: I feel like if they do changes DH are getting nerfed they seem to be the most complained about thing
[4:28:12] zachgamegodx: a lot of the eu warriors were just using mastery vers stuff, a few played engi bracers
[4:28:58] zachgamegodx: oh I meant
[4:29:00] zachgamegodx: dh
[4:29:02] zachgamegodx: sorry

[4:34:46] zachgamegodx: feel like you can always get  off the big combos with them
[4:35:01] Landrysdad: what classes do you think go best with pres?
[4:35:23] austin_545: does xeeks comp scare you guys are all or do you feel comfortable against that?
[4:36:19] al_capow: mes do you guys ever need a fill for gnomer raid?
[4:36:34] al_capow: my guild needs me tuesdays, but the second lockout for the week ill be free

[4:48:52] blackpooh01: can anybody recommend me a pvp healer to watch?
[4:49:00] austin_545: why arent we seeing double outlaw much right now. outlaw is so insane it seems like that should be a thing.
[4:49:40] zachgamegodx: ret outlaw fw seems better  idea bc sanc and freed
[4:50:38] zachgamegodx: I just dunno what ret outlaw does better at than dh outlaw, though I dunno

[5:49:38] dawsonator171: Havoc isn't relevant in MDI atm, I doubt we see changes.

[6:09:36] Shablagoosh: foor the last 10 years
[6:10:02] Devcomz: SOD still seems to be extremely popular if it remains so I could see them doing all sorts of stuff with it
[6:10:30] avenueone: i really hope kara crypts comes at 60
[6:10:34] dawsonator171: What if they bring in a sinestra boss in SoD? That could be great.
[6:10:42] Ignite_CLO: whats the addon on retail that shows the buffs and debuffs bigger above the name plates ?
[6:11:05] dawsonator171: @avenueone we need to do the first raids in Cata, for mes' memory sake.
[6:11:26] avenueone: im never doing bastion of twilight with mes again.
[6:12:27] avenueone: theres 2 60 phases
[6:12:30] avenueone: that we know of
[6:13:45] dawsonator171: I wish I had some of the BFD gear. I'd imagine it would make leveling easier.
[6:14:12] Anhak: daws can u be on tmrw?
[6:14:16] dawsonator171: I have no fun leveling either. It's a drinking/eating simulator.
[6:14:34] dawsonator171: @Anhak about an hour or 2 before now tomorrow.
[6:14:43] Anhak: yea i think bfd isnt locked rn
[6:14:54] Shablagoosh: ive watched bean do 2 bfds today
[6:15:00] Shablagoosh: its a full level from 25-35 ish
[6:15:10] Anhak: i think we got a bfd reset today
[6:15:22] Anhak: yea no lockout on my hunter which i ran with erin
[6:15:36] Anhak: yea so we could do bfd
[6:16:16] Anhak: i would say we could get ave in but hes already passing where bfd really does anything
[6:16:57] Anhak: hes 33 RN so he will be 40 tmrw KEKW

[6:17:48] eMBeaR64oz: tryin to do another gnomer, soooo hard to find healers
[6:17:51] dawsonator171: I'll join if you make it happen.
[6:17:56] avenueone: im pretty sure bfd resets in 29 hrs
[6:17:58] avenueone: no rush
[6:18:14] dawsonator171: I won't be. Sadge.
[6:18:29] Anhak: daws just ask and we can do like an alt raid
[6:18:53] dawsonator171: I've got to get this DH geared to collect this seasons glad mount.
[6:18:57] Anhak: i think we can very easily like 5 or 6 man it
[6:18:57] dawsonator171: So I can be great again.
[6:19:17] dawsonator171: I also need mes to gear outlaw. Kappa
[6:19:32] Anhak: actually ill bet money that at 40 avenu can solo it
[6:20:39] Anhak: well
[6:20:44] Anhak: at 40 you resist half the spells
[6:20:44] dawsonator171: ave is really good at loot and scoot.
[6:20:47] avenueone: meta is a tank/healer/dps
[6:20:54] Landrysdad: @dawsonator171 this seasons glad mount is my favorite ever
[6:21:00] Anhak: YEP
[6:21:10] Anhak: takes less does more more avoidance etc etc
[6:21:11] LichbornHQ: how Ziqo saying warlock is a mage just a better version :D
[6:21:16] Anhak: they nerfed warrior
[6:21:22] Anhak: they heavily nerfed warrior
[6:21:23] avenueone: warrs got nerfed
[6:21:25] avenueone: and no runes
[6:21:29] avenueone: or shit tanking runes rather
[6:21:40] Anhak: no runes warrior nerf and 40% armor
[6:21:42] Anhak: warrior down bad
[6:21:50] dawsonator171: is rogue tank bad?
[6:21:54] avenueone: belt is -3 rage on all/ insta stam/proc slam
[6:21:58] Anhak: rogue tank isnt GOOD

[6:22:25] Anhak: well rogue tank isnt warrior bad *
[6:22:31] avenueone: only missing bout 350~ armor
[6:22:44] Anhak: rogue tank at 60 is gonna be like 70+% avoidance
[6:22:49] Anhak: rogue tank RN is like 50% avoidance
[6:22:58] avenueone: did u see how quick i died
[6:23:00] Anhak: warlock tank RN is like 40% avoidance tho KEKW
[6:23:19] LichbornHQ: @Anhak wotlk dk tank :D hughe avoidance and health pool
[6:23:19] dawsonator171: I feel like with the runes bears could get crazy.
[6:23:45] eMBeaR64oz: the dam they can do during beserk kinda nuts
[6:24:04] dawsonator171: berserk deez
[6:24:17] Anhak: bear is getting some nice buffs on reset
[6:24:38] Anhak: swipe is getting ap scaling + a threat buff and then zerking is getting aoe lacerate
[6:25:13] dawsonator171: aoe lacerate is kind of nuts
[6:25:26] eMBeaR64oz: only 3 groups tryin to run gnomer and ALL lookin for heals then g2g feelsbad
[6:25:46] Anhak: altho bear kinda suffers really fucking bad with gnomer being a raid because MCP was by far the most OP threat gen wep in the game it litterally made in pre raid bis bears WAY out threat warriors and now they have it for 30 secodns then 3 min cd
[6:25:46] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[6:25:48] avenueone: ask mike
[6:25:55] avenueone: how enjoyable was it healing my warr on last boss gnomer
[6:26:09] dawsonator171: he said very
[6:26:25] Anhak: daws lied
[6:26:37] eMBeaR64oz: haha
[6:26:43] eMBeaR64oz: ave you shoulda heard me in cord with krome
[6:26:49] avenueone: yea krome alrdy told me =P
[6:27:02] eMBeaR64oz: "holy shit im spamming healing touch what is this cardboard!"
[6:27:14] Anhak: KEKW
[6:27:25] Anhak: and his threat is shit KEKW
[6:27:27] eMBeaR64oz: thank god for wild growth though
[6:27:39] eMBeaR64oz: without wild growth rdruid healing would be the bottom tier 10000%
[6:27:52] avenueone: devastate nerfed hard
[6:27:58] avenueone: shield block worst avoidance in the game
[6:28:03] Anhak: his devastate at lvl 25 was hitting like 150-160 on average at 40 its hitting like 100 TOP
[6:28:05] Ignite_CLO: does anyone know an alternate addon for flyplatebuffs ? it causes so many errors for me
[6:28:12] eMBeaR64oz: rsham healing seems alright, not super insane, felt like i had to spam heal a lot during last 2 fights
[6:28:18] eMBeaR64oz: but rsham mana regen felt so insanely good
[6:28:29] avenueone: and thats not even
[6:28:34] avenueone: including the extra armor mobs have
[6:28:38] avenueone: thats testing on mobs in the open world
[6:28:53] Anhak: @eMBeaR64oz yea rsham seems like maybe the weaker of healers but doesnt have any mana issues so like thats good where as druid and preist can go oom
[6:29:22] Anhak: yea warriors got recked and then u realise mobs have 40% armor and warriors are double recked
[6:29:22] eMBeaR64oz: its def a really good support class
[6:29:32] eMBeaR64oz: sham rage + mana spring gave me so much mana regen
[6:30:01] Anhak: i havnt seen any arcane mage this tier i liked what rshaman brought for sure
[6:30:21] eMBeaR64oz: im most likely planning to go arcane with my mage, fire atm
[6:30:31] eMBeaR64oz: having a hybrid just seems really good for this raid
[6:30:33] Anhak: fire FUCKS
[6:30:39] Anhak: fire really fucks
[6:30:39] eMBeaR64oz: fire does in fact fuck lol
[6:32:28] Anhak: feel like rshamsare like 1-2 things from really insane like earthliving or something like that puts them reallly strong
[6:33:12] eMBeaR64oz: nah i just felt bad lately, and then getting sleepy around this time
[6:33:27] eMBeaR64oz: but yeah i guess i havnt been on retail in quite some time
[6:34:11] eMBeaR64oz: basically at the starting line, whenever we played with jerru i ended at 2380 or something before awc
[6:34:20] eMBeaR64oz: jerry*
[6:34:25] Chillinar: just solo shuffle
[6:34:25] xGriefxGodx: Lushy left

[6:45:59] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[6:46:27] dawsonator171: just had an hpriest 6-0 into an rsham. meta makes zero sense atm.
[6:47:04] Chillinar: i hate how small classic bags are no cap
[6:47:31] dawsonator171: mes loves small bags
[6:48:54] avenueone: yes
[6:51:33] dawsonator171: I feel like they should launch a second raid mid phase.
[6:51:53] dawsonator171: because the last one seemed to drag for everyone that I watch.
[6:54:46] artsskeit: tough spot.  sweats are probably already raidlogging
[6:56:45] eMBeaR64oz: wait mes
[6:56:48] eMBeaR64oz: guild message wtf
[6:56:55] eMBeaR64oz: who hatin
[6:57:52] dawsonator171: it's not wrong. he does play dk which inherently means that, even coming from his mouth.
[6:58:03] artsskeit: what is it
[6:58:07] artsskeit: for non-mes guilders
[6:58:32] artsskeit: harsh but fair
[6:58:50] avenueone: i wonder who put that there
[6:59:09] artsskeit: not even full 99 parses yet
[7:00:42] dawsonator171: has mes ever landed a 99 parse?
[7:00:58] avenueone: can get int on 2h too
[7:01:02] avenueone: dno if theres anything else
[7:01:24] smander: u can play invig but since we have OP aspect of Viper and can take mana pots and even farm dark runes its kinda weak
[7:01:56] artsskeit: ah yes hunter parse.  afk auto shot with an op pet
[7:02:01] artsskeit: better nerf them 7 more times
[7:02:06] avenueone: what pet
[7:02:12] Shablagoosh: theres that ironforge whatever website that shows armory kind of
[7:02:17] smander: and dual wield is also a boot rune so ya
[7:04:59] dawsonator171: mes' pet sucks confirmed
[7:05:18] artsskeit: pets take after their owners
[7:05:42] avenueone: definitely not their names
[7:05:46] avenueone: craig would do way more damage
[7:06:27] artsskeit: whats the 2h mace with the red border

[7:09:32] dawsonator171: Listen, People Cheer "Let's go Brandon" because they know a high quality name when they hear it.
[7:09:37] artsskeit: too much of an australian name and will require a diet of vb and darts
[7:09:43] smander: you can run 3/5 frez with BT and 4/5 with a 2.0
[7:10:28] smander: ya the extra talent points take it back to the pets energy regen
[7:11:25] smander: so u can dump points into mend pet pet - spirit bond - etc depending on pve or pvp focus
[7:11:27] avenueone: i hear hunters raid bis is just the 1h fist to be a debuff bot for a caster stacked comp
[7:12:48] smander: ya u took 3 into armor alot will but that 3 into pet health and then 1-2 free points into pet armor b/c of how the HP modifier works with ur pet stam talent
[7:14:27] avenueone: nop
[7:14:31] avenueone: locks aint gona use that
[7:14:32] smander: they'll probably have to figure something out. its the smae question how wont we use the LW gloves at 60 if we can FD gear swap
[7:14:41] avenueone: unless a weps 1.2 speed a lock aint meleeing
[7:15:46] artsskeit: is this the mes grinding for mount segment

[8:20:28] thunderstud25: because he wanted to wipe them out
[8:20:30] karaste: When her father attacked the Horde, Jaina didn’t fight with him and he died as a result
[8:20:46] waitimdesyncd: They "nuke" it yeah
[8:20:50] waitimdesyncd: and jaina gets angry at dalaran
[8:20:56] thunderstud25: no it was Warcraft 3 and then garrosh bombs Thera more later
[8:20:58] waitimdesyncd: for hidiing garroshs plan

[8:21:32] duskerzx: i kinda enjoyed bfa, but ADORED legion so much,
[8:21:42] thunderstud25: Warcraft 3 the horde kills the jaina’s father from what I remember and then later garrosh bombs theramore
[8:21:55] Shablagoosh: I didn't enjoy legion at all and I sort of liked bfa i was weird

[8:22:25] artsskeit: i am my scars
[8:24:15] waitimdesyncd: OSRS is all about leveling
[8:24:17] waitimdesyncd: from start to finish
[8:24:28] waitimdesyncd: And the quests are actual quests and puzzles
[8:24:54] waitimdesyncd: PvP is also built into the economy of OSRS
[8:24:58] atlasglassstudio: ya tr
[8:25:20] Shablagoosh: yea mythic plus is the only part of wow that goes endlessly
[8:25:21] devascienos: if they make retail leveling take to long people would complain its always a rush to get to max level
[8:25:25] Shablagoosh: isnt artifically capped like pvp
[8:25:35] duskerzx: that must be why i keep boomeranging on the game actually. im no pvp'er, or hard raider, and a lot of the collecting stuff just seems not worth too much trouble
[8:26:26] Shablagoosh: im 3.4k mythic plus
[8:26:31] devascienos: retail isnt an rpg its a rogue lite game at this point
[8:26:48] Shablagoosh: they definitely lost a lot of the "special" that mythic plus had by removing seasonal affixes
[8:26:50] waitimdesyncd: @devascienos kinda how they wanted torghast
[8:27:04] Shablagoosh: people simultaneously love and hate affixes
[8:27:08] Shablagoosh: no
[8:27:11] Shablagoosh: well that way kind of
[8:27:19] Shablagoosh: but we had a seasonal in shadowlands s4 with all random dgs
[8:27:31] devascienos: @waitimdesyncd yeah but its not just part of the game its the whole game
[8:27:31] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[8:27:45] fadthl: most of the seasonal affixs were trash
[8:27:47] waitimdesyncd: @devascienos  sadly ye
[8:27:58] waitimdesyncd: The BF4S¤ portals were dope
[8:27:59] waitimdesyncd: S4*
[8:28:13] Shablagoosh: most of the playerbase that does mythic plus is brainwashed by streamers saying they hate affixes
[8:28:18] Chillinar: I mean after thundering they removed seasonal affix lol I remember how everyone hated that
[8:28:23] Shablagoosh: but most people that actually do m+ at a high level like them
[8:28:23] amkttv: imo m+ is too much like a slot machine, and affixes are a pain - why not make them boons instead? it's endlessly scaling anyway, people will hit the wall with negative or positive affixes
[8:28:47] waitimdesyncd: @amkttv  yeah I agree
[8:28:57] Chillinar: remember necrotic? shit was horrible
[8:29:01] thunderstud25: that’s a good take @amkttv
[8:29:02] Chillinar: or the bleeding one
[8:29:03] Chillinar: ew
[8:30:42] Shablagoosh: this expansion is as filler as it gets imo
[8:30:45] Shablagoosh: like a part of an anime you skip
[8:30:50] waitimdesyncd: He never really did the DF story. He never made it to valdrakken
[8:30:55] shugguls: i got no idea whats going on this expansion and i raid..
[8:31:01] amkttv: gameplay >>> story & art
[8:31:08] Chillinar: Story feels like eh but gameplay is fun.
[8:31:44] waitimdesyncd: Im a lore nerd, and always have been. And DF is very FILLER! But I wish he got to try something in retail
[8:32:00] amkttv: if story & art were so important, why are games like vampire survivors so good? it's all about good gameplay
[8:32:12] waitimdesyncd: Shadowlands became filler because they failed, but the plot was GIGA
[8:32:14] duskerzx: they both are
[8:32:15] shugguls: @waitimdesyncd get hi into a solo shuf
[8:32:44] waitimdesyncd: and in shadowlands it was about Sylvanas being used to reinstate the jailers powers by stopping bolvar from holding the plan back
[8:33:04] Shablagoosh: wod pepelaugh
[8:33:08] waitimdesyncd: @shugguls  At least seeing valdrakken would show you there are actual people playing it :(
[8:33:48] waitimdesyncd: He says that and never tried the newest expansion. But I agree with him
[8:34:09] waitimdesyncd: I think Classic+ is going to keep hold of casuals more than Retail will
[8:34:16] shugguls: @waitimdesyncd true , new city's does effect the player base community
[8:34:50] waitimdesyncd: Classic = MMO, Retail = Game mechanics

[8:41:59] waitimdesyncd: I was like him and played OSRS for a long time. And OSRS is basically classic+ and they have had success with it since 2012, making the game bigger than it has ever been for Jagex (the creators)
[8:42:18] waitimdesyncd: OSRS is classic+ and came out in 2012

[8:49:41] waitimdesyncd: Thats when they had their game death
[8:49:59] waitimdesyncd: they removed PVP also and people hated it
[8:51:08] waitimdesyncd: PK = Player killing = PVP
[8:51:37] Chillinar: LMAO

[8:52:55] Shablagoosh: yep
[8:52:56] Swaggerhound0: yea
[8:53:02] wowsuomi: They did drop vaulable loot
[8:53:40] waitimdesyncd: ecanamistry is hard
[8:53:53] wowsuomi: Not many ppl liked the update but it worked but a few years lately they changed it back
[8:56:01] wowsuomi: This the worst vid about rs ever
[8:56:44] waitimdesyncd: @wowsuomi  how come
[8:57:01] wowsuomi: Nothing killed off rs other then everyone growing old and ppl going back and playing osrs
[8:57:33] Shablagoosh: eh theyll prob go over it more in the vid but
[8:57:37] Shablagoosh: they killed the combat system as well
[8:57:44] wowsuomi: Os rs is still doing pretty well
[8:57:45] Solushun: what rating are you in shuffle on this guy?
[8:57:46] waitimdesyncd: The fact the game is bigger than ever after they made Classic+ in OSRS in 2012 means that people wanted to play
[8:57:55] Shablagoosh: and these days rs3 "modern" has like 10k averaghe concurrent players and 2007scape has 200k
[8:58:25] waitimdesyncd: @wowsuomi  but OSRS is doing great exactly because they went back and rebuilt the game from when it was fu
[8:58:27] waitimdesyncd: fun*
[8:58:55] Shablagoosh: it has fully killed their retail version though which im sure blizzard is worried about
[8:59:02] wowsuomi: Yeah i like the concept and there doing i in sod now
[8:59:27] waitimdesyncd: microtransactions killed RS3, when you could pay for a maxed account in 2011 it was GG
[9:00:03] wowsuomi: I hated sin to win
[9:00:20] wowsuomi: Spin*
[9:00:43] meanseason92: i don't know why they ever went through with the eoc update. right beforehand i had an account with low defense and the new prayers with the leech & dungeoneering weapons. and it was completely destroyed LUL worst moment in gaming
[9:01:02] waitimdesyncd: @meanseason92  giga true
[9:01:03] meanseason92: i can't remember what the year was though when they updated it
[9:01:20] shugguls: double ww?
[9:01:35] shugguls: not seen that
[9:01:43] waitimdesyncd: thats scary
[9:01:49] waitimdesyncd: because Im where the best arena pvp is D:
[9:01:52] Shablagoosh: i think sod will get rated bgs at 60
[9:02:06] wowsuomi: @meanseason92 20 November 2012
[9:02:11] devascienos: I don’t think arena but rbg maybe
[9:02:19] wowsuomi: I stopped around then aswell
[9:03:21] wowsuomi: I was already maxed way before that anyway so i was bored
[9:03:26] the_phen9menal: Helloooo
[9:03:54] meanseason92: cata and mop arenas actually kind of exciting tho, wouldn't it be completely possible for live pvp to die @notmes
[9:04:09] meanseason92: same game with twice the buttons and no demon hunters
[9:04:29] Shablagoosh: i mean wrath is fully dead and that was supposed to be the most hype return
[9:04:49] wowsuomi: The discontinued items in rs are from around 2001 and there worth as much as a house these days
[9:05:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: I hear the dead game meme about 100 times a day, but when I log into games like Classic Wrath, people are there
[9:05:47] waitimdesyncd: @wowsuomi  OSRS account names also worth same as a house in some countries
[9:06:17] waitimdesyncd: @wEiRdO_dUdE  Wrath arena is def not completely "there" it was very dead basically from the start :(
[9:06:43] Shablagoosh: yea wrath is very dead and i imagine cata will be too
[9:06:56] Shablagoosh: esp if sod keeps going

[9:10:10] waitimdesyncd: Even then u have to join that 1 server and make a character of the main faction to find a team, and then you find the same dudes over and over. S1 was War/hpal every single game and it killed arena for me and my PVP friends
[9:10:22] waitimdesyncd: 6-0 and sound is fine for me
[9:10:50] abracadabrax: Insane damage
[9:10:57] waitimdesyncd: Now you can go ahead and play Wrath arena and be smacked around with shadowmourne

[9:14:10] nikthevoker: fingers going numb/shooting pain so annoing

[9:17:39] waitimdesyncd: @wowsuomi  ofc, they are from 2010 to prove a point hehe

[9:25:56] modsbruto: what we watching ?
[9:26:06] waitimdesyncd: its old
[9:26:19] waitimdesyncd: they fixed the game that same year the video came out
[9:26:34] waitimdesyncd: Yeah, they added more well-rounded content
[9:26:49] americanmoses18: OSRS is dope af
[9:26:53] wowsuomi: Overall allright vid
[9:27:20] waitimdesyncd: Trading post is decent, but I only use it once per month to buy everything
[9:27:32] duskerzx: i hear a bunch of people liking it. im ok with it
[9:27:44] complexified: @notmes do u have a indepth UDK guide somewhere i can read?
[9:28:15] waitimdesyncd: Yeah thats true
[9:28:16] 122552096: the new talent system is overrated, it's basically the same thing as the old talent sytsem for most classes/specs imo
[9:28:23] wowsuomi: I know Venrukis take is never put old pvp mounts in or make fake reclolored versions
[9:28:27] duskerzx: im actually down for it myself. it can feel a bit limited tho to me
[9:28:39] 122552096: i'm locked into 90% of my talents, i can only change a few of them (same thing as shadowlands if u include changing legendaries)
[9:29:24] 122552096: i cant hear what you're saying rn because i have an ad, but the talent system is an illlusion of choice
[9:29:24] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[9:30:13] 122552096: you don't have 61 choices, you really only have like 5-6 for a realistic pvp build on most of the classes that ive played yea
[9:30:21] waitimdesyncd: The OSRS dev team from 2 years ago proved that a dev team can lose track of their players, but that scared Jagex into making better content, and listening to players to avoid OSRS dying like EoC did. I wish Blizzard would listen the same way, and give us updates and communication EVERY WEEK, like osrs does every wednesday
[9:31:25] TheBackstabi: Talent system (both classic and new ones) were always best for leveling. I'm OK with max level having only a smaller handful of genuine choices. Imagine if you HAD to have multiple loadouts and swap multiple talents literally every game.
[9:31:29] 122552096: the new talent system does seem good for lvling. much better than the previous system
[9:31:49] waitimdesyncd: @TheBackstabi  True
[9:32:55] 122552096: yea i agree
[9:33:01] 122552096: there's also pve to consider

[9:40:05] cookietime95: mesHi
[9:40:22] cookietime95: nts amigo
[9:40:38] Jyster: Dragon flight isnt too bad. Its a good and bad expac. They just have been trying to do too much. Some changes have been needed, but the talent trees imo are way way too much. There's lots of useless talents that dont benefit in either pve or pvp. Keep everything, but revert the talent trees, and I think most people would be happy.
[9:40:40] waitimdesyncd: The player population never recovered from the lawsuits and the FF14 migration
[9:40:40] ToThePainTV: Yeah retaining talent, and then getting new talent.
[9:40:46] watisthiswebsite: people just negatively attach blizzard with their old workers so i guess they dont wanna play their games
[9:41:25] wowsuomi: Most of rs devs are britsh
[9:41:59] ToThePainTV: Its widely spoken of about how horrible it is to work at blizz with pay and conditions, and the lawsuit just made the rep to work for them even worse. Cali is one of the most expensive places to live in the US, and they just don't have a competitive salary because "you get to work at blizzard"
[9:43:28] cookietime95: no the games dead cause of SoD Kappa
[9:44:09] cookietime95: i leveled... its just classic with cheaters
[9:44:12] ToThePainTV: Do you think they just need to do a WoW 2 type project? New engine thats not spaghetti, new classes/ redo all the classes they havent done, dragon riding is the new main flying ect
[9:44:49] ToThePainTV: everything you collected and everything can move over.
[9:44:50] duskerzx: its way too late for a wow 2
[9:45:04] honsou2: @ToThePainTV youre talking about activision-blizzard developers LUL
[9:45:28] duskerzx: @ToThePainTV that just sounds like overwatch 2. same game and even slower progress
[9:45:35] ToThePainTV: @honsou2 oh I know.
[9:46:11] wowsuomi: If they did a wow 2 it should start at a new xpac and all the old xpac items and achive points are good
[9:46:17] ToThePainTV: seasons like diablo then? gotta relevel each season?
[9:46:20] Jyster: My take is alot of people are upset about balance changes. But I've heard too many things about ability bloat, healing issues, and just everyone being anti social, so no one can find teammates for 3v3 or 2v2. There needs to be some changes in game, but most of the changes need to happen with the community
[9:46:24] wowsuomi: Gone*
[9:46:41] honsou2: its an AAA game, its a minimum viable product, they will never ever give you more than you expect such as a fresh world update
[9:46:54] wowsuomi: Like a full restart with out all the old zones and content
[9:47:14] waitimdesyncd: this is cozy tho
[9:47:19] Chillinar: has she taught you math yet?
[9:47:26] ToThePainTV: good convo isn't bad content lol
[9:47:40] duskerzx: this dogshit content pile is so cozy trizzeCozy
[9:48:11] parmejohn__: i think there should be wow 2 and arenas should be a new game itself
[9:48:14] wowsuomi: Microsoft could rename it what ever that want
[9:48:39] honsou2: i super disagree with that. The leveling process is not what keeps the game going. New world died after 2 weeks
[9:49:15] waitimdesyncd: @wowsuomi  I vote for: World of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
[9:49:21] cookietime95: my big reason for unsubbing, no one to play with.. people rushed KSM and dropped
[9:49:23] A_Fat_Dab: very
[9:49:30] nikthevoker: thank god i cant stand hunter gun sound
[9:49:30] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[9:49:48] mayfire15: and there is no world rn. no one lvls lol
[9:50:00] Swaggerhound0: new world didn't die cause of leveling tho, the game's economy was dog, their AH was down a lot and duping was going on
[9:50:40] honsou2: i mean they tried to "refocus" the leveling by updating the whole world in cataclysm and it didnt really matter. I think the allure is "discovery" not just a good immersive leveling. A wow 2 would need to surprise us, have us looking for information etc.
[9:50:43] thunderstud25: right, if you weren’t exploiting you were just falling behind lol
[9:51:40] meanseason92: new world looked and sounded amazing, but it's a game with 6 buttons and fps mechanics LUL how do you make hard content that isn't just frustrating for a game like that
[9:52:00] Jyster: I think its the communities fault. We are toxic af to new players, and that pushes people away faster than anything
[9:52:07] americanmoses18: i liked leveling in slands it was fun then

[9:52:38] honsou2: no ur right in terms of getting new people to join, but if the endgame loop still leads to the same place it wont truly change much. Except maybe a bit higher retention of people who try it
[9:52:54] devascienos: wooo shuffle is fun just had a ret afk twice and sabotage my game success
[9:52:55] honsou2: yeah if they could find a way to expand the "non-competetive endgame" that would be fantastic
[9:53:03] devascienos: the game is just 3 mini games
[9:53:41] parmejohn__: what are your thoughts on pvp of wow becoming its own game
[9:53:46] wowsuomi: As time goes on the barrier For new players in rs keeps getting easier because it used to take years to get maxed and it way faster now and everyone pvm,ing for gold are alot more skillful nowdays

[9:55:20] Chaskw: Oh shit
[9:55:29] ToThePainTV: Thank you for the gifty!
[9:55:36] hunchurio: sod kind of gives that experience
[9:55:37] Chaskw: @devascienos Thanks!
[9:55:46] hunchurio: but its boring lol
[9:55:48] devascienos: I think gear needs to be the next thing to look at
[9:55:54] mayfire15: yeah game development doesnt sounds fun. glad i dont have to do it
[9:56:23] Mokaonly278: BRING IT ON
[9:56:45] duskerzx: this will sound dumb, but out of the corner of my eye that graphic for gifted subs looks like someone mopping across the screen real fast LUL
[9:56:54] honsou2: Yeah if they could bring back the feel of server and also integrate the different "minigames" again. Im in the minority maybe but i like when the game systems work together not raid/dungeon/pvp for 3 diff communities
[9:57:15] JonnyBDK: I think they really need to sort out mythic raiding cause finding 20 players everyweek is depressing me so much.
[9:57:15] thunderstud25: and make the level cap 200 - forced to play every cpansion in sequence
[9:57:18] thunderstud25: lolol
[9:57:20] thunderstud25: jk
[9:57:44] duskerzx: I was saying 'out of the corner of my eye' attention was on a game of another screen lol
[9:57:55] waitimdesyncd: My friends that has never played WoW wants to explore the whole world, but there is nothing to explore anymore
[9:58:00] devascienos: you make the leveling linear again so they can build the main story and not just 4 zones with their own story
[9:58:06] thunderstud25: @notmes when we playing helldivers 2
[9:58:11] thunderstud25: or paldworld
[9:58:15] thunderstud25: pal*
[9:58:17] yepbeef: wanna do 2s while you wait for q
[9:58:18] waitimdesyncd: My homie are like "oh but isnt the wow world so big with so many years of content?" and im like "not really"
[9:58:21] honsou2: i have a halfbrother who is 15 now and he plays genshin impact, he sees wow and thinks "this looks very cool but theres so many abilities its too much" which is a depressive perspective for wow veterans Kappa
[9:58:26] McmanHealer: I don't know about Dh's but, can they heal themselves in fight?
[9:58:45] thunderstud25: it’s got mixed for now because of some server issues, once that is resolved it will trend back
[9:58:48] waitimdesyncd: @thunderstud25  I just finished Palworld, its a ton of fun
[9:59:10] devascienos: self healing needs to be nerfed?
[9:59:37] TheBackstabi: I'm not sure if "damaging" is the right term, but more "polarizing"; some people like the competition, some people don't
[9:59:37] devascienos: the mdi 4 dps no healer like
[9:59:52] Jyster: I tried to get my fiancee to play. They got to level 10 as a hunter, and they got overwhelmed. They do not play any sort of MMORPG. Thats also saying something. Its upsetting because we are used to that.
[10:00:03] thunderstud25: damage meters, logs etc, very damaging - sort of just promotes a toxic behavior
[10:00:15] thunderstud25: I get that people want a measuring contest
[10:00:20] honsou2: I actually think they have removed a bit of that competition by making classes more locked in where they end up on dps meter. Whereas 3-4 expansions ago the most skilled/most tryhard would get #1 on meter
[10:00:22] waitimdesyncd: youre against anyone of your own class
[10:01:10] nikthevoker: ya but thats them not knowing how to use something
[10:01:13] honsou2: yeah true as long as it exists it will be used to try and pick the weakest link
[10:01:30] nikthevoker: nononon
[10:01:32] duskerzx: @thunderstud25 there is some point to it when there's literally people just not even trying to play the game, just floating there waiting on others to do the work for them while they get a 'tag' been seeing that all too often
[10:01:40] nikthevoker: not being able to use details correct
[10:01:45] wowsuomi: But what if they never kicked the guy and replaced him they might never of got the kill
[10:02:21] nikthevoker: they shout GIT GUD?! LUL had to
[10:02:50] waitimdesyncd: obfuscate
[10:03:01] memil141: output?
[10:03:06] nikthevoker: obs vue gate
[10:03:15] devascienos: @wowsuomi 1 person doesn’t make you wipe to the point you can’t clear
[10:03:37] waitimdesyncd: now the word sounds weird to me --  I agree that promoting the TOP and calling out AFKs, but no reason to flame people that are trying to learn
[10:03:53] thunderstud25: I mean look, let’s assume that you didn’t have a measure for someone’s performance, it might mean that pugs die, but the behavior you will likely see is people trend towards durable social groups
[10:04:05] thunderstud25: which likely is the direction you want for an MMO anyway
[10:04:48] honsou2: @thunderstud25 yeah back in the day we all knew who was the bad players in our raid groups but they still raided because of this
[10:04:58] devascienos: remove the need for a wa to track every mechanic
[10:05:25] nikthevoker: theres always a low and top end
[10:05:34] waitimdesyncd: I was the noob huntard in WotLK nax back in the day trying to get into end game content for real, and people still brought me and taught me
[10:05:34] meanseason92: i like logs :/ guess i'm in the minority but i don't think mmos work without them, even looking at final fantasy every decent raider is going to use act offstream
[10:05:43] jporter_: I fell for the patch note hype, really thought this was the week we were rgoing to get some
[10:05:43] the_audacity_x: there’s a direction connection between bosses having to be designed harder because off the add ons and it rebounds back a forth with increasing mechanics to meet the add ons until eventually the game will play itself for you. I’d rather not play optimally at the cost of add ons
[10:05:46] devascienos: how are they meant to get better if people don’t let them play
[10:05:56] ToThePainTV: well with 40 people if 5-10 are bad, the other 30 make up for it. but with 10-20 man groups, its noticeable with who is bad and such

[10:07:31] devascienos: like wrath was people looking at parses for groups
[10:07:31] waitimdesyncd: People dont bother learning encouters now and just rely on Deadly Boss Mod, and then they complain about people not doing the best, because they themselves also are kinda shit but not AS shit, so they dont make up for the bad players because DBM enables them to barely make it thru the encounter
[10:07:57] meanseason92: I actually feel so strongly about it that i don't think ashes of creation could possibly succeed at the high end. The devs have said they won't allow logging or meters and i automatically assume that means it's too casual to be good. I'm not trying to be toxic it's just a mindset idk
[10:08:20] waitimdesyncd: being fun to do content with is a big part of it for me
[10:08:22] honsou2: we should probably go back to only 2 raid difficulties, its silly that they make a "lfr tier" not just for the game content but it becomes a tier of playerbase
[10:08:43] duskerzx: i at least like the idea of actions per minute idea of yours, could show if someones just slacking, afk, irl distractions, or genuinely somehow barely float through the game
[10:09:08] wowsuomi: @devascienos What about that forhorseman guy
[10:09:10] Topher45: @notmes is there something like warcraft logs for arenas?
[10:09:24] waitimdesyncd: @meanseason92  Now you gauge the performance of the whole group in Ashes of Creation. You evaluate the group as  a whole, instead of attack lower performing players
[10:09:35] Topher45: right but im curious if they have something that i can analyze the logs and globals myself
[10:09:35] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[10:09:43] duskerzx: and somehow peeps might actually help people become better rather than deleting others too
[10:09:59] HappyCamperZA: @devascienos ty ty for the gifted
[10:10:38] thunderstud25: it’s like in irl where you have that friend that is an idiot but they are your idiot
[10:11:04] honsou2: @thunderstud25 yes because guild raiding becomes a community, where as when you pug there is no social aspect, no one cares how nice you are anymore
[10:11:05] thunderstud25: directionally you need durable social groups for the game to have long term success
[10:11:06] waitimdesyncd: @thunderstud25  yeah exactly, if they are fun to be around and do content with then thats all thats needed imo
[10:11:16] wowsuomi: I grew up with everyone running Gearscore
[10:11:20] nikthevoker: not evryone is trying to be ht ebest
[10:11:27] waitimdesyncd: You can sell worse players if they are fun :D
[10:11:44] Topher45: @nikthevoker i swear you're online 24/7
[10:12:18] waitimdesyncd: imo mes is onto something very real here
[10:12:28] Topher45: ^
[10:12:41] nikthevoker: @Topher45 i sleep like 2-4hrs prolly why LUL
[10:12:43] biofreaks: The game had WAY more players when PVE & PVP were 'more casual'. That is fact. But, this is also a 20 year old game (thats a HUGE factor).
[10:12:58] waitimdesyncd: its a negative feedback cycle of top players being worse because there are only top players left
[10:13:33] ToThePainTV: not for the art style that wow is
[10:13:43] waitimdesyncd: it looks beautiful
[10:13:48] wowsuomi: Those clips are old tho
[10:13:49] biofreaks: Ive never had a problem with WoW graphics. Always thought the art team was always A+
[10:13:53] honsou2: idk bro have u seen like orgrimmar made in UE4
[10:14:07] waitimdesyncd: osrs is basically on the same stuff yeah, just new shaders
[10:14:24] honsou2: but you can change the scale vastly
[10:14:28] wowsuomi: But ur point still stands care more about story the cgi haha
[10:14:35] meanseason92: i understand, but wouldn't the best case be to introduce opt in logging, so that shy or learning players would be able to hide their damage and players at the high end would still be able to enjoy hard content without understanding why theythemselves are doing nothing wrong and unable to progress for months at a time.
[10:14:55] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: holy oversaturation
[10:14:59] waitimdesyncd: yikes ngl
[10:15:19] ToThePainTV: going into westfall from elwyn
[10:15:29] ToThePainTV: I think the lighting effects make it look wierd
[10:15:33] ToThePainTV: and the motion blur
[10:15:48] duskerzx: i'd be fine to check out really newer graphics, but id really want to be able to adjust and see old/new and such
[10:15:50] shugguls: need the camera further for pvp
[10:16:01] wowsuomi: Ill need to wear sunglasses while playing
[10:16:13] waitimdesyncd: what about the orgrimmar one, is that more Wow-like
[10:16:14] duskerzx: these ue4 showoffs are always hit and miss LUL
[10:16:18] minumx: there is a better one of the gates of orgrimmar
[10:16:24] honsou2: i think you could make wow feel very renewed by changing the scale of objects and your character, stuff is too small. a road doesent really feel like a road, you cross distance very easily. Thats what i like from the UE5 remakes
[10:16:39] shugguls: lol imagine the snow areas
[10:17:34] shugguls: would love to see duskwood
[10:17:37] honsou2: project grunt has a orgrimmar gate that looks insane he made
[10:17:59] TheBackstabi: Those walls lookin kinda untextured
[10:18:07] biofreaks: I would love to know how many employees Blizzard has working on pvp. Is it 5, 10, 100? How many do they have working on PVE related gameplay? If they truely only have 5 people on the PVP team and the PVE team has 100, then id understand.
[10:18:10] addyz0r: AI is awesome technological advancement
[10:18:27] ToThePainTV: see that looks good, the sup braight stuff did not.
[10:18:52] cookietime95: nah looks like shit like all alliance capitals
[10:18:53] waitimdesyncd: looks like a 2004 game trailer
[10:18:54] yepbeef: people who play on toshiba laptops - WutFace
[10:18:55] derangedhippo: It looks like the gates of mordor haha
[10:19:07] shugguls: its more sleet than snow, maybe global warming from from after cata
[10:19:19] devascienos: reminds me more of bwl enterance
[10:19:32] ToThePainTV: I think it looks good because you can actually see the architectural work in the stone and such
[10:19:41] duskerzx: is this supposed to be ironforge?
[10:19:50] minumx: im not a fan of this one
[10:19:54] honsou2: Well also its made by just 1 guy as a fan project, the real product would be much higher quality
[10:20:05] shugguls: its to shiny
[10:20:26] honsou2: Try writing project grunt: orgrimmar gate
[10:20:30] nikthevoker: is rainbow almost 40 yet?
[10:20:33] TheBackstabi: Everything being either completely reflective shiny or flat matte is annoying, there's no material distinction
[10:20:48] meanseason92: don't worry chat with 3 expansions already in the works  we can expect warcraft to keep the same graphics for the next 7 years LUL
[10:20:58] waitimdesyncd: the UE orgrimmar gate video is kinda like the Saurfang x Sylvanas Mak Gora
[10:21:02] minumx: @honsou2 yeah i remember this one being pretty sick
[10:21:09] SUPER_MEGA_T_REX: looks worse than realistic games looked 10 years ago
[10:21:18] ToThePainTV: True
[10:21:20] amkttv: that place must be hot as hell
[10:21:22] waitimdesyncd: @SUPER_MEGA_T_REX  I feel the same way
[10:21:29] ToThePainTV: also before you afk where can I get your dk ui?
[10:21:35] mynameistwavis: this looks like what a wow tv show would have
[10:21:54] shugguls: better
[10:22:00] cookietime95: yeah because its org..
[10:22:03] duskerzx: whats this one's title?
[10:22:12] ToThePainTV: this video is the one that looks really good. Best looking city imo
[10:22:15] cookietime95: its actually a cool city concept... not just a tree or a cave
[10:22:15] waitimdesyncd: orgrimmar is uniquely WoW

[10:22:35] waitimdesyncd: No :L
[10:22:36] TheBackstabi: Ironically I think this one needs a -little- bit more saturation.
[10:22:41] TheBackstabi: Just a tiny bit
[10:22:42] honsou2: nah its just the gate LUL
[10:23:22] waitimdesyncd: thats a nice gate

[10:23:36] devascienos: aight it’s bed time good night all have a blessed rest of your guys day
[10:23:38] waitimdesyncd: alliance spy
[10:24:12] devascienos: it’s all good I started to feel a bit off aswell
[10:24:46] honsou2: yep AI will make things wild we just have to sit tight
[10:25:27] honsou2: probably wont be long before some AI program can just fix those things as an overlay in any game you want
[10:25:29] waitimdesyncd: imma make food. Time started flying
[10:25:32] minumx: i feel like shaders can improve the graphics by quite alot
[10:28:17] wreklol: anyone else missing the frequent class tuning?
[10:28:34] ToThePainTV: anyone know where I can get the ui package for retail?
[10:32:02] minumx: @ToThePainTV on the discord i would guess
[10:32:02] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes

[10:36:32] nikthevoker: im trying to decide between low cr alt 3s or SM for viper book
[10:37:14] nikthevoker: ya, SM gy lowest mobs, rares+ boss higher chance

[10:42:38] biofreaks: Agreed @sunileif
[10:42:56] sunileif: Under the guise of "we working on xpac"
[10:42:59] biofreaks: Then the dreaded last season of this expansion.. just waiting for the war within.
[10:43:27] shugguls: not on there priority list
[10:43:59] sunileif: Gotcha "fuck everyone playing now" makes sense
[10:44:10] biofreaks: Ive looked at the hero talents so far. That's great and all, but what about content? Are they overhauling pvp? That is what we really need in the pvp community.
[10:44:46] sunileif: "Hero" talents
[10:45:04] sunileif: Mes you excited to be an earthen dwarf?
[10:45:11] sunileif: Horde side
[10:45:37] shugguls: rogue letting his healer 1v2 - interesting tactic

[10:49:30] wantafantaa: What about mistweaver? It's not too late

[10:55:13] sunileif: @irishethics fist em good and hard
[10:57:15] waitimdesyncd: Looks like we arent getting any tuning
[10:57:31] sunileif: Nope
[10:57:59] waitimdesyncd: ahh ok
[10:58:30] americanmoses18: at this point imma do wut i did last ssn. get all my 1800 mogs, run heroic once a week, and one 2100 char cuz this shit stale
[10:58:36] americanmoses18: and no class tuning is so bad
[10:58:47] waitimdesyncd: The evoker in me is stoked I get to still be OP, the DK in me is sad we dont get a lil tuning, but Dhs being so over represented right now is rough
[10:58:51] sunileif: payoTter
[10:59:17] americanmoses18: glad i pushed my dk before it sucked the ass up lol
[10:59:35] waitimdesyncd: @americanmoses18  Getting 2400 on Devoker was the easiest push Ive ever done. you should try it
[10:59:35] sunileif: Sucked the ass up?
[10:59:47] americanmoses18: yup right off the floor @sunileif
[11:00:05] sunileif: Sucked the ass up right off the floor?
[11:00:09] wowsuomi: Market taking a dump today, thats like 3 days in a row'
[11:00:32] americanmoses18: i mean tbf if im pushing 2400 its gunna be on a dh lol @waitimdesyncd
[11:00:45] sunileif: Moosey carry me
[11:00:56] sunileif: I got a fw im learning
[11:01:08] americanmoses18: ill abuse the broken class idc
[11:01:19] waitimdesyncd: @americanmoses18  That was nowhere near as fun as on the Dev, and also Dev was not far behind in how easy it was
[11:01:35] arthpvp1: ggs mes
[11:01:43] americanmoses18: i dont like dev playstyle doesnt fit me
[11:02:00] waitimdesyncd: @americanmoses18  May I ask why
[11:02:58] americanmoses18: charge up abilities and shit i just dont like the feel. i have a 70 voker it just doesnt feel good for me. and listen im an altoholic i get like 9 chars each ssn 1800+....i just dont like how dev plays
[11:04:03] waitimdesyncd: Ahh that makes sense. But mainly you dont want to charge the abilities, you usually mostly want to use r1 abilities. Its close range like a melee, with a easy but extremely powerful damage rotation kind of like DH, and youre as mobile as a DH, and very tanky for your mobility level. But yeah, I feel you on the alt part
[11:04:32] waitimdesyncd: Not everything is for everyone for sure
[11:05:21] gelatokush: dev feel less clunky with a certain lvl of haste 0% haste is clunky as hell
[11:05:36] cookietime95: stormtrooper: chat i have an emergency message from the president of the united states of america. (door_open) (walking) (coughing) biden: hello my fellow americans, this is an emergency broadcast telling you that you all need to take a dab right now. everyone take a dab for the sake of the country.
[11:06:07] waitimdesyncd: @gelatokush  i have 2 evokers at 2200+, and one is full mastery, and the other is 30% haste, 30% vers and 50% mastery, and the 30% haste evoker I have was an alt, but it has become the one I pushed 2400 on
[11:06:08] wowsuomi: Haha nice
[11:06:17] Lollerask: I am dabbing as hard as possible, Mr. President
[11:06:23] waitimdesyncd: haste is very underrated on the class since no one mains Dev, and everyone just follows what the Pros do when they alt dev

[11:07:54] waitimdesyncd: Dev has a neat trick where you can double your dps if you know when to re-activate disintergrate during the casts, there is a weakaura that can help you see it on your castbar. It can easily do 500k dam in a single tick, when you figure it out
[11:07:57] gelatokush: i like to look at top m+ players to see their stat allocation, i feel like pvers are much betetr at min maxing dmg siming diffrent builds, and as of lately most class top build in ss originates from pve builds
[11:08:27] waitimdesyncd: @gelatokush Yeah thats fine if youre new to the class, but if youre pushing 2400 you want to figure it out for yourself
[11:08:36] waitimdesyncd: you dont need to minmax dam on devoker at ALL
[11:08:46] waitimdesyncd: its the most broken, simple, straightforward insane damage no matter what you do
[11:08:59] waitimdesyncd: You wanna minmax survival and how you use mobility, like a warrior
[11:09:21] gelatokush: nah more of general guideline to when u gear most pvper will go armory top vper copy the build and call it a day
[11:09:31] waitimdesyncd: using timestop on your healer when the enemy hunter stuns your healer and wants to trap, rescue second trap etc
[11:09:59] waitimdesyncd: @gelatokush  Not here. You will see mes spends a lot of time trying stuff out and testing it with first hand experience, and that helped me get 2400 consistent too
[11:10:24] gelatokush: yea mes tries alot of stuff
[11:10:29] gelatokush: i do the same
[11:11:06] waitimdesyncd: Dev is in a special spot where nobody actually mains it truly. We have a lot of people that have played it for 3 seasons, but thats not true main level yet. You have to really find what suits you when you play dev
[11:11:13] Gizzlefsb: week 5 no class tuning time to quit
[11:11:28] waitimdesyncd: @Gizzlefsb  super frustrating indeed
[11:11:29] gelatokush: i dont main anything really
[11:11:45] gelatokush: im 2.1 + on every class'
[11:13:03] waitimdesyncd: @gelatokush  Yeah I went through the same, Rogue, Shaman, Death Knight, Warlock, Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Monk. But when I took dev seriously I found out I could actually compete with much higher than2400 players just  from having all the game knowledge of the alts
[11:13:03] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[11:13:17] waitimdesyncd: I think u can have a lot of fun, if you find something that you feel is worth investing your time into
[11:13:18] gelatokush: u dont see alot of main nowdays, game is very alt friendly and pvp is super meta gaming which promotes alting and rerolling and learning every class
[11:13:24] waitimdesyncd: -- and that is super rewarding
[11:13:39] waitimdesyncd: Having alts doesnt mean you dont have a main
[11:13:45] gelatokush: just depends how u enjoy the game i guess
[11:14:03] waitimdesyncd: the main is the main, alts are the alts. We all have a ton of alts, and that gives us a lot of knowledge, but if you dont use that knowledge to improve your main it will be less fun
[11:14:21] gelatokush: for u perhaps
[11:14:45] waitimdesyncd: I just enjoy becoming better at PVP, feeling like I get better, beating people I couldnt before.  Pushing higher ratings with my more casual friends for the highs
[11:14:57] waitimdesyncd: But yeah, im arena motivated so thats always gonna be my viewpoint
[11:15:30] gelatokush: i get bored playing same class for too long
[11:16:06] healmeshammy: 2 hour shutdown for what lol
[11:16:19] waitimdesyncd: Yeah I feel that too, but then I learn something, or test something, or improve something about my UI, addons or game strats, and I instantly feel motivated to get back in to testing and playing with all the new knowledge
[11:16:33] gelatokush: and i dont enjoy high rated pvp taht much when it becomes to sweaty i tend to wana gravitate towards another alt
[11:16:46] waitimdesyncd: This season in order to beat Dhs you are kinda required to have a DH alt you can learn, and that sucks. You need to learn them to counter them rn
[11:17:14] Chickenpantz: hot take, no class should have high damage if they have self heals
[11:17:24] waitimdesyncd: @gelatokush  Yeah I feel you on that. But then it sounds like you know what you want, and you are a good player
[11:17:50] waitimdesyncd: @Chickenpantz  ghost crawler is that you
[11:18:45] Chickenpantz: Lol, i dont pvp anymore, wayy to many things to track and deal with at a competitive level
[11:18:53] Chickenpantz: i quit pvp around WOD
[11:19:21] Chickenpantz: enjoy watching vods with breakdowns of whats happening so i can appreciate what actually happened in those 3 globals though
[11:19:39] waitimdesyncd: So true chicken
[11:19:52] waitimdesyncd: but almost every game is like that now, requires a time investment outside of your gametime
[11:20:14] waitimdesyncd: watching vids/guides whatever, and it ruins the fun of it, but it is certainly required
[11:20:20] gelatokush: i guess thats why fps are so popular they dont require that
[11:20:35] Chickenpantz: ^, you go in, shoot, finish the match
[11:20:38] Chickenpantz: thats it
[11:21:16] NightMunchies: its a win or lose situation
[11:21:22] Chickenpantz: what i loved about WOTLK-Mop era pvp, was so much more casual friendly, go in arena, farm some points, get the good gear, roll people
[11:21:57] Chickenpantz: i never needed 3 keybinds for each of my CC and multiple cd trackers to stay above 1900 cr lol
[11:21:57] NightMunchies: i loved Wotlk
[11:22:03] waitimdesyncd: It is casual friendly if there is a big enough population, but therei snt right now
[11:22:05] gelatokush: personally i enjoy being knowledgeable in a game, every game i ever played since internet exist i always look up guides an learn the most b4 actually playing and thats a process i kinda enjoy, but i can see not being the case for everyone
[11:22:09] waitimdesyncd: everyone is super good at the game now (generally)

[11:23:41] Chickenpantz: put some effort in
[11:24:16] NightMunchies: u have to put some effort into whatever you're doing:-)
[11:24:33] gelatokush: lets say u never ever played wow your friends dont play wow and War Within comes out are u gonna buy it ?
[11:24:53] NightMunchies: cant just get carried all the time expecting to learn that way
[11:25:21] NightMunchies: im going to buy it
[11:25:53] NightMunchies: well not if i didnt play it from the Start No
[11:26:03] Chickenpantz: Fuck no gelato, i reccomend every friend to not play wow, it crippled my teen years lol
[11:26:44] waitimdesyncd: @Chickenpantz  I joined in BFA s4 and started pvping for the first time and it was all fresh, and I enjoy it so much
[11:26:57] gelatokush: i dont want your perspective i want the perspective of someone new

[11:33:33] NightMunchies: soon bud it will be up
[11:33:43] NightMunchies: not Again lol
[11:34:03] fatherdougz: Dagoth: How did cavemen not have constant erections? Like no-one is ever wearing clothes? Damn how would they not have constant erections seeing titties and pussies all the time. I would not be able to concentrate on hunting if I were a cavemen. Maybe they did have constant erections but we just don’t know. It would have been helpful if they drew some cave art depicting cavemen with constant erections. Would have been a great source of history
[11:34:06] Chickenpantz: usually its 15 mins even if it says 2 hours

[11:55:41] sixthycent: war is kinda like disc priest people play it more even when its not S tier
[11:55:42] mayfire15: dh warr probably a little more damp
[11:55:48] healmeshammy: only petkick still plays it at high
[11:55:53] figurines: pvp without changes for so long is depressing
[11:56:16] NightMunchies: i play a frost Dk i just love it
[11:56:21] mayfire15: @NightMunchies frost is just a 1 min class. you do nothing for 1 min and if you dont kill on your go, its gg
[11:56:35] Gcannonz: have you got to ride that rocket yet?

[11:57:39] NightMunchies: i been doing really good in Bgs i topped my 300 honor lv
[11:57:44] ponchuus: Agree
[11:57:48] addyz0r: agree
[11:58:00] figurines: it felt like they cared a lot about pvp at the beginning of the xpac. and that feeling has slowly faded as we go. pampered by this xpac or torn down and expectations set so low in the past.
[11:58:05] addyz0r: it's been has been the best for pvp - EVER
[11:58:43] healmeshammy: but they havent inject the mmr though
[11:58:57] addyz0r: remember was it vfa, that was almost 2 years?
[11:59:01] addyz0r: bfa*
[11:59:09] NightMunchies: crazy yeah
[11:59:18] mayfire15: they might not wanna do changes rn for AWC. i'd be great for them to tell us
[11:59:55] NightMunchies: we listen to the ones without rating lol
[11:59:55] mayfire15: wow community loves to  complain
[12:00:02] chizzad52: Remember in shadowlands when people couldn't climb because gear gatekeeping.  Or in BFA cause of corruption. I think people just cant handle the fact they are not as good as they think they are
