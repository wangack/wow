[1:28:25] NOHITJEROME: BIS for wrath endgame is Fury Warrior and Fire Mage, 2 of my favorite specs
[1:29:06] Blenfz: ret pallies are also huge on wrath endgame, 4 pc t10 is awesome
[1:29:25] NOHITJEROME: Ret paladin is so good in pvp too I hear @Blenfz
[1:29:34] NOHITJEROME: Paladin + Warrior 2s in arena, that will be the most fun comp
[1:29:41] NOHITJEROME: Paladin can remove stuns apparently (?)
[1:29:49] Blenfz: true
[1:31:02] NOHITJEROME: Lifegiving Gem is so good on warrior
[1:31:17] NotZarlinBrah: prot pallys would 1v3 consistently in wrath in later patches forsenS
[1:31:21] NotZarlinBrah: god help us all

[3:45:32] dan21289: I think I averaged like 10-15% up time on the debuff for it
[3:45:38] palettenpaule: Hey swifty
[3:46:05] enthusedtv: It's not as fun, but Annihilator would add more damage for your raid than Nightfall.
[3:46:24] dan21289: Nah, not even close to 100%. I think the best I got was around 60-70% up time one time.
[3:46:36] GGNightShadeGG: It might be worse proc rate on pally because you don't have a hast buff like shamans.

[9:40:07] DulapRoFTW: Hello Swifty! Greeting from Romania! <3
[9:41:15] Knullzey: If you plan on driving more in the future, yes.
[9:41:29] CommanderVasya: 2 one handers or 2 two handers ?
[9:41:30] hydraponix: if your vehicle is paid off then its not gonna save you anything for many years
[9:41:33] varianpally: one secret kept from me before i bought my electric car is, regular trustworthy mechanics cannot fix most issues - you are forced to go to your dealer. Dealer charges 5-10x the cost. Nobody mentions this, as to how expensive it is. If you have even 1 broken component its no longer worth it
[9:41:35] Djtobbi: If you use a tesla you use average 18.1 KWh/100 km, if you use a fuel based car, the average fuel consumption is about 9.3L/100km
[9:41:47] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[9:41:59] Velashen: EV is a savings but now is not the time to buy a car.
[9:42:22] Wickedcarni: I'm a mail carrier, i have to fill up every 2 days at max :(
[9:42:29] Velashen: @varianpally There are far fewer components with an EV. That is partially true but misleading.
[9:42:47] Djtobbi: @swifty If you use a tesla you use average 18.1 KWh/100 km, if you use a fuel based car, the average fuel consumption is about 9.3L/100km, I don't know if that is worth it in the US
[9:43:06] Knullzey: You don't necessarily need a tesla, there are other electric vehicles
[9:43:22] varianpally: @Velashen doesnt matter, 1 broken component and it's over. My battery was 14k to replace
[9:43:43] hydraponix: on your usage of 200 a month, you'll only be saving 100-150ish a month so think of how long you need to save 150 a month to equal a 60k tesla
[9:43:55] Velashen: @varianpally Well yes the battery is of course the most expensive component. That is unfortunate for sure.
[9:44:53] varianpally: @velashen when my check engine light goes on, my mechanic cannot fix it, else it voids any warrant surrounding those components. SO i have to take it to the dealer.
