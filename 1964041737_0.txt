[1:06:07] fooxytv: MMO Champ leak season is gold

[1:57:32] Bugszy: @Jeddek_ do time walking last 5 weeks and end of this week you get a mount
[1:57:33] qrazieee: Thats right! I love DF!
[1:57:38] Jeddek_: Rip
[1:57:38] Thoreya: LUL LUL
[1:57:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: kicked for low gear score, the true WotLK experience
[1:57:40] deaddwarfwalking: its a manta ray looking thing
[1:57:45] Jarlan23: @91Niki monkaS
[1:57:48] dano9: is there anyway to watch blizzcon live?
[1:58:03] viirracocha: too long and aslo only way to craft Decay gears as a LW.. :O
[1:58:03] rblood80: Hi Towelliee
[1:58:05] 91Niki: At some point people are just toxic to be toxic, and it's tiring
[1:58:06] deaddwarfwalking: shale something or other is the name in game
[1:58:09] DunzoCD: @91Niki hes hella annoying LUL
[1:58:09] nativej96: more people play retail regardless
[1:58:18] Jeddek_: @Bugszy that's sad. Ive been on a WoW break for a couple months now, so hope it comes back at some point
[1:58:21] KaisenSiru: ^
[1:58:39] Necrom93: One of the greatest things to come from this xpac for me is the UI customization.
[1:58:41] strike879: ppl watch classic because they want to see the streamer fail and lose their character
[1:58:49] viirracocha: dave the diver
[1:58:52] onenonlynass: What are you looking fopr them to do to increase people logging in?
[1:58:54] beachangus: Retail just not as fun to watch as it is play. Hardcore has more of a pull for viewers
[1:58:55] RageerPLZ: I got my 1st 100 in diablo, and nothing left its weird feeling not grinding
[1:58:59] Demanisraar: I play retail daily still... only for an hour or so, but still log in

[1:59:23] Metket: @mejiro151 no he said he wil play brew and dh for m+
[1:59:24] belfastcl: is there any big MMORPG out there where you can grind like back in Legion?
[1:59:40] MrJanarli: Do you think classic plus is coming? or you think its all hype
[2:00:02] DunzoCD: @91Niki ive tried having a civil convo with the dude here and it doesnt seem like hes capable of that lol
[2:00:04] fooxytv: 10.2.7 has shown up on the PTR
[2:00:12] fooxytv: maybe a little patch
[2:00:16] Gomace: Can you tell us a story about one of your first accidental discoveries in WoW? Like falling off the zeppelin to orgrimmar from Thunder bluff and discovering the crossroads.
[2:00:19] mejiro151: @Metket Im just messin since hes on the warrior, we all know Towelliee will do all the tanks at some point
[2:00:20] Snabido: Neither, it's copium üòè
[2:00:29] onenonlynass: Are you happy with the direction WoW has taken or do you want a power creep/grind back?
[2:00:30] 91Niki: @DunzoCD Yeah I don't think so either. and I can't fully tell if he's trolling or just got a few screws rattling around
[2:00:32] Metket: @mejiro151 ^_^
[2:00:47] Ziddrax: troll heritage armor copium
[2:00:55] viirracocha: did u look into the new Lotr game? think it will suite u
[2:01:08] Theduskflyer: Imagine still farming the Sha mount. ü•∂
[2:01:15] Gomace: Are you excited for Classic+, if it happens?
[2:01:27] Gomace: or do you like retail more
[2:01:35] onenonlynass: agreed
[2:01:44] Yurian33: i just cant wait for the new season to launch
[2:01:56] Asuo_: I am a little worried about all these private auras being the norm while making fights so complicated with horrendous visuals (orange swirls on orange floor)
[2:01:59] JBonezey: Let's hope its not the BFA to Dragonflights Legion
[2:02:29] PilusMedicus: we can atleast all agree MoP was so bad it crossed the border of,  blizzard must be trolling
[2:02:31] lisa1111: i'm casual player.....i have pretty much enjoyed every addon but dragonflight was good for us casuals
[2:02:35] KaisenSiru: BFA was good
[2:02:36] DeanoTV: loved BFA
[2:02:45] Gomace: I liked Apexis Crystals
[2:02:49] DeanoTV: twilight dev Kreygasm
[2:02:51] chinfu303: @PilusMedicus aint no way
[2:02:53] Jarlan23: too many chores in bfa i couldnt do it but it was better than shadowlands at least

[2:02:54] JBonezey: BFA was good after the initial patch, they left the first half of the game out to dry a bit.
[2:03:23] coldhandsbeatz: Im sure if your job is playing the game 10hrs+ a day BFA was far more enjoyable than to any of those with way less time or less constant playtime lol
[2:03:25] neftario105: Morning today, I am 42 years old is my birthday üéÇ ü•≥
[2:03:40] Demanisraar: Never ending LUL
[2:03:44] kyotoboss: but it was a so useless grind .. and tyring
[2:03:44] Lintgamer: BFA was amazing imo. Loved doing the grind
[2:03:48] Demanisraar: Island grind AP grind
[2:03:50] xziyn: BfA was just horrible for alts or people that took a break
[2:03:56] Demanisraar: Corruptions
[2:03:58] raldrik: I liked BFA's grind. I also love the random loot upgrade. Felt so good to get a nice TD3 upgrade
[2:04:03] DeanoTV: im an altaholic and loved BFA
[2:04:04] onenonlynass: It did but there has to be a way for people to have that content without it affectinhg power so much
[2:04:07] viirracocha: BFA was awesome to play with WM on
[2:04:12] zysmos: Played the end of BFA and had so much fun
[2:04:25] Beerplz: BFA was a great expansion once essences came into play
[2:04:30] onenonlynass: With kids, it made it hard. It would be great to figure out that happy medium
[2:04:30] honkblarg: the only bad thing about bfa was early azerite armor, the rest of the systems were amazing and fun
[2:04:40] lisa1111: @neftario105 happy birthday

[2:04:46] Gomace: Do you think Blizzard will ever make previous expansions playable, with their old systems like Legion Legendaries and BFA Corruption gear
[2:04:48] Crovzz: true  i was about to say casual players like me didnt have a good time but it was ok.. i loved the story too
[2:04:48] xziyn: BfA with proper catchups for alts and returning players would be best IMO
[2:04:57] Demanisraar: Dragonflight was a nice reset of the game.. now we need some nice new and cool stuff. Kinda hype for Blizzcon to see what they got for us

[2:05:06] Argabad: i want wildstar back PepeHands
[2:05:12] onenonlynass: It's true but that philosophy could change
[2:05:24] onenonlynass: They've already had to change the way they think
[2:05:35] DeanoTV: 100%
[2:05:36] onenonlynass: I loved Visions
[2:05:42] Crovzz: @Argabad me too bro me too

[2:05:47] onenonlynass: I thought visions were fun as hell
[2:05:49] DreamWebb: did you upload anything about the Pantheon stuff recently Towelliee
[2:06:04] JBonezey: I think 8.2 and 8.3 were great patches, 8.1 was just okay.
[2:06:07] temp3st98: I like power grinds if there is catchup from the start @Towelliee
[2:06:12] rbailey_2222: hello

[2:07:13] DeanoTV: @coldhandsbeatz truee

[2:07:46] kyotoboss: GL on Beacon
[2:07:55] JBonezey: If I dont have time for raiding other than LFR, is it worth coming back to DF?
[2:08:12] valianya: I don't understand why so many people think DF story is bad?
[2:08:21] asmodai4823: this groups dps is grim
[2:08:23] Ertra: @ptahm0se that depends on what you enjoy in the game
[2:08:28] railander: @myrinn18 legion story was good for the most part. BFA was alright, but SL and DF just terrible
[2:08:49] JBonezey: SL story was so bad
[2:08:55] rhodistar: Would be nice if people would stop complaining about a game so much... The game has changed, deal with it :) Find something else to do with your time. There are SO many options in 2023
[2:09:03] kyotoboss: @railander thats pure copium talk
[2:09:18] valianya: But why do you think DF story bad?

[2:10:16] railander: @valianya i'll watch bellular's lore videos all the time and it's frankly the most boring story, always stop watching before the end.
[2:10:22] Demanisraar: Haven't really payed attention to the story/lore since Legion.. And I was huge on the lore before.. just lost interest in it.
[2:10:47] SamuraiWillZ916: I go to Nobel for lore
[2:10:50] kaeleirra: Not impossible I've wiped at like 10 percent in lfr
[2:10:51] Demanisraar: Areyousureaboutthat.jpg

[2:11:51] kyotoboss: raid dead , classic lfr LUL Kreygasm
[2:12:14] valianya: If you're bored of how Bellular is recapping the story of DF, maybe you should go play through the story yourself and form your own opinions
[2:12:15] JBonezey: Are they fixing the tank balance in 11.2 or is Druid just remaining god tier?
[2:12:23] JBonezey: 10.2*
[2:12:35] PotbellyGoat: I don't remember LFR being this bad in Legion

[2:20:31] Bhish: It's because most "healers" are actually just DPSing
[2:20:48] Gioozey: is this lfr?
[2:20:52] DunzoCD: the most annoying part of LFR is seeing people that are 437+ ilvl doing 10-20k dps cuz they are hitting one button and not trying at all

[2:21:19] deaddwarfwalking: that's the thing with sark.  It is a fight with individual responsibility and there is no way to make LFR easy unless you gut the entire fight
[2:21:31] gho5tfinger: 100k hardcore classic tourny qualifiers is today that should be good content
[2:21:42] Aidler: I only do lfr
[2:21:52] falldrgn: Imean. There are some people who don't give a shit. cause its LFR. But there are others who actually try to lead and not just yolo pull

[2:23:38] Amarlian: @Red_Fr0st_ On that note, I think they should have unlimited Rez in LFR
[2:23:42] snake_like: sark is annoying in LFR but razsageth was on another level
[2:23:45] zysmos: They don't even bind that shit in these raids LUL
[2:23:48] viirracocha: i interrupt all the time in LFR

[2:47:24] Yurian33: gimme new season. Im happy for months
[2:47:28] fetza108: classic is not that what it meaned in the beginning. not its just rereleasing the expansions with changes
[2:47:31] Codeblue2023: World of Warcraft  Reforged - thats my guess
[2:47:34] temp3st98: yeah my exact thought LUL
[2:47:35] fetza108: *now
[2:47:37] Fawcheddar: I think its more like keeping classic mechanics and adding raids and content to it
[2:47:38] OldManSaul: Exactly Dragonflight is classic plus
[2:47:38] tszord: Classic plus. Only green items drop
[2:47:44] WadeWilson: WoW Classic but with tuning changes to make all specs viable and dual spec and new dungeons and raids
[2:47:57] Squats3: maybe they just yoink everythign ascension has done for the luls
[2:48:04] Molvonos: @WadeWilson So Retail.
[2:48:05] luckfore: just give me mop and and legion after that and i will be happy
[2:48:10] Orthobullet: The question is do they go cata or a different route all together
[2:48:13] fetza108: i think they will maybe rerelease mop too and they will stop... maybe
[2:48:23] OldManSaul: @WadeWilson  I like that
[2:48:30] paulson14: if they keep doing classics were do we draw the line panda land?
[2:48:33] fetza108: but cata i think 100% coming
[2:48:33] temp3st98: Classic+ is what expansions are but without the expansion title LUL

[2:50:12] DunzoCD: i feel like the classic plus people just want more easy AF raids cuz retail is "too complicated"
[2:50:16] Sollice: If you want a classic like experience just turn your graphics to like 0 on retail
[2:50:20] Sollice: Thats really what you want

[2:51:07] CardinalTX: I think they will start new server with faster expansion unlocks just like Holley Longdale started while at Everquest
[2:51:09] szeeman62: @towelliee Congrats my sub to this channel lasted longer than my marriage lol
[2:51:13] TheGiant99: They should of never did classic at all. All it has done is split the player base.
[2:51:24] Sollice: @szeeman62 Aww thats kind of sad lol
[2:51:33] gho5tfinger: @szeeman62 LUL
[2:51:35] fetza108: @TheGiant99 and maybe funneling the playerbase to retail

[2:52:57] Kinghorn: F R E S H
[2:53:00] Molvonos: 'Different'.
[2:53:08] Kinghorn: did someone say fresh? fresh where fresh
[2:53:10] fetza108: @TheGiant99 and bro those splits are existed but on private servers. they did the classic to make the people pay for them (blizzard) and not being on private servers
[2:53:15] Sollice: So if Blizzard doesnt announce Classic + at Blizzcon, will people shut up about it or keep talking about it?
[2:53:22] Squats3: every 6 months? it would take me that long to get to 60 lol
[2:53:24] Molvonos: THEY WILL NEVER STOP, SOL.

[2:53:45] Kinghorn: give me a furbolg raid or give me death
[2:53:48] Mystai: @Molvonos Don't have to be like, condescending, I'm speaking to the idea of classic+. Doesn't have to be a real or manifested thing.
[2:53:49] AvrithSATX: Even Blizzard's going, "I can't wait to find out what Classic + is!"
[2:53:50] Kinghorn: cobaltMald
[2:53:52] Theduskflyer: Classic+ is seasons.
[2:53:52] mavericks312: @sollice classic+ at 2024 blizzcon then lol
[2:53:53] luckfore: wow community is delusional
[2:54:02] Sollice: Your right Molv. It will turn in to another name and they will keep talking about it. THEY DIDN"T ANNOUNCE CLASSIC+ BUT THEY ALSO DIDN"T RULE OUT CLASSIC LEGACY
[2:54:08] lilwaldo: @Towelliee I just waiting for Classic+++
[2:54:09] Shrenko: imagine Blizzard taking what Turtle wow is , people would freak out and say '' Blizzard is back ''
[2:54:12] chinfu303: man life would be ez if i was as delulu as classic players

[2:54:42] Molvonos: Nostalgia ain't gonna bring shit back.
[2:54:46] Mystai: I personally think Classic+ is nearly impossible because so much of what carries classic in general is nostalgia
[2:55:04] MoodyVanessa: @Molvonos and we basically have them already at least as a customization option but i guess they probably still talk about them as a playable race

[2:55:32] Molvonos: @WildRaellie Precisely.  But because they're not called High Elves, it's not good enough.
[2:55:32] Squats3: @Squats3 i mean, thats what nostalgia is made of.
[2:55:42] szeeman62: @towelliee the most important question for the viewers do you give out fun-size or full size candy bars on Halloween?
[2:55:56] Argabad: re-releasing expansions will NEVER be the same as you remember it back when it was actually fresh and new... again, lich king literally killed in 1.5 hours. it's not the same game you remember
[2:56:02] Sollice: Yes but nostalgia is normally a very specific thing. Classic is not really classic and people want something different
[2:56:07] fetza108: i am curious for the announcements
[2:56:26] ArcaneSyntax: They should just remaster classic, same content, updated.
[2:56:27] Sollice: @Argabad Exactly, part of the fun was doing something when it was NEW. It will never be new again
[2:56:31] Shrenko: you can
[2:56:33] Sollice: @ArcaneSyntax WHAT
[2:56:35] Mystai: I mean every time I hear someone talk about what they want in classic+ it's a bit meh, Uldum, Hyjal, and stuff that was eventually done already
[2:56:39] Molvonos: Classic Mas y Menos: Spanglish Edition
[2:56:39] Beerplz: @Towelliee they were job openings for such teams for classic though
[2:56:42] Sollice: Molv did you see what that guy just said
[2:56:44] Red_Fr0st_: Underwater cataclysm raid
[2:56:44] Beerplz: there*
[2:56:55] erdls: didnt they double classic team size after wotlk
[2:56:55] Molvonos: @Sollice I did.  I am confused as to what it's supposed to mean.
[2:56:59] mika0000001: I want a WoW Horde mode
[2:57:13] Darkstar_Universe: they can do that though. blizzcon release fresh servers and then they buy time to get it done. blizz has done that in the past
[2:57:15] PlagueTV: lol they are letting u speculate again? thats good to see
[2:57:34] Sollice: I think we should have a DKP goal where Classic is blacklisted term and you have to use points to say that word
[2:57:34] Zettabyte: #WeGoAgane #ClassicCata
[2:57:35] Squats3: i dont think most of the classic community would want cata. pretty sure it would be a big ol flop
[2:57:36] 91Niki: Tomorrow is last day
[2:57:36] Jarlan23: i hope during that deathwing cinematic happens that a big rock drops down on his head and kills him
[2:57:40] Jarlan23: and thats how classic + starts
[2:57:41] Molvonos: Oh
[2:57:44] CriticalPhil: tomorrow it ends
[2:57:44] Molvonos: That's a good idea.
[2:57:50] temp3st98: LUL i expect alot of booing if they announce cata and i will laugh
[2:57:56] Gruffian: Doesnt end til Wednesday
[2:57:59] valianya: Its Monday man
[2:58:01] Molvonos: I dont think the bossman'll let that one fly tho lol
[2:58:02] KaisenSiru: If the Classic players want "new" content, well current WoW is right there for them, where it actually has a future and always seeing updates
[2:58:06] Asuo_: Would be weird to end Horseman before Halloween
[2:58:10] Sollice: @Molvonos He wont but one can dream
[2:58:17] Molvonos: Like Classic+ people.
[2:58:18] luthiennes: Wednesday at 11.00 am it ends
[2:58:19] Kinghorn: they are always the same
[2:58:21] Molvonos: towSip
[2:58:22] monark6259: !build

[2:58:26] HotHotHeals: Same affix every dungeon
[2:58:32] valianya: Reset is Tuesday, its Monday @towelliee
[2:58:33] HotHotHeals: Yup
[2:58:36] abbott012: Yep
[2:58:43] teelegit: Every Utgarde Keep and Utgarde Pinnacle is the same ice floor
[2:58:51] lilwaldo: I'm just reading what he mods are saying. This is great, carry on lol. KEKW
[2:58:52] 91Niki: Horseman ends Wednesday at 10am server. So tomorrow is last reset to do it
[2:58:53] Kinghorn: UK and UP are always frost shit, spider dungeons are webs, HoS and HoL are the stacking buff
[2:59:00] teelegit: Occulus, Nexus and violet hold are mirror images
[2:59:10] fetza108: honestly the thing i dont like in classic the people expect from you everyrthing because this is a 15 years old content... but what about the players who never did this content? they are rushed as fuck... and maybe stressful for them... So clasic for a new player is hard too
[2:59:42] Kinghorn: troll dungeons is the poison blood, nexus oculus and VH are mirror images and CoS sucks balls

[3:01:40] beastoburden: what server is he on for classic
[3:01:57] Mecabeast: @beastoburden mankrik i believe
[3:01:58] fetza108: @fetza_twitch so in classic you feel as a new player too you have to know everything in this old content. it is an expectation. there is no real discovery because there are million guides out there
[3:02:19] Molvonos: Yes
[3:02:23] Molvonos: That's kinda what Classic is.
[3:02:43] DunzoCD: classic isnt really meant for new players its for the people that never grew out of it

[3:03:18] beastoburden: need a tank or dps
[3:03:21] Molvonos: It's old, it's been done in ad nauseam, expecting something 'new' beyond basic mechanics, like what they implimented with these beta, gamma, slammajamma things, would be silly.
[3:03:26] Mallaes: Mage go JAJAJA
[3:03:31] Kinghorn: that fucking frost mage
[3:03:31] yenaffit71: yenaffit71 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:03:37] Mecabeast: casters not stacking in AN/OK is the worst
[3:03:50] S1appadabass: classic is mid
[3:03:59] Molvonos: That'd be like me going back to Everquest and expecting a completely different experience from when I played in decades ago.

[3:06:26] Metket: next tank Kappa
[3:06:30] ParfumAmerican: rocket boots +  a warlock - can walk pass the door in front and summ to last boss :)
[3:06:36] Argabad: this guy's gearscore is too low! get him out!
[3:07:01] Mystai: ice hurts but you need it to put out fire basically
[3:07:05] Mecabeast: it gets buggy if you have both same time tho
[3:07:17] Mallaes: coxDerp
[3:07:26] Mallaes: really?

[3:09:51] valianya: So it rewards you with a buff if you do the mechanics correctly?  Imagine if you got a buff every time you do mechanics correctly in Retail?  LoL, people actually learning mechanics so they get that extra % of dps
[3:10:08] fetza108: yeah thiss is
[3:10:10] j_bar111: steals all your gold
[3:10:19] morgitoo: hey, do you guys know what is this addon/weakaura at the lower bottom corner with the statistics?

[3:17:09] GroovyBryan: Thanks!
[3:17:11] Captain_Aegis: how are bears looking?
[3:17:28] Fawcheddar: Are you going veng for 10.2
[3:17:34] GroovyBryan: Bears are fun to me
[3:17:53] GroovyBryan: Dh and blood feels weird to me
[3:18:16] Asuo_: Have shaman, rogue and hunter ready for 10.2 for just this reason
[3:18:24] Dudutoolbox: what classes are just not viable for mythic raiding?
[3:18:37] asmodai4823: every spec is viable for mythic raiding
[3:18:51] sitmeee: facts
[3:19:16] Asuo_: @Dudutoolbox Until 10.2 hunters unless they did like 15k more dps than those with a raid CD

[3:20:09] Dalsonson: More def just means you can wear some Hit/Expertise or Exp/Crit dps piece somewhere. Not the end of the world
[3:20:13] Mystai: I actually thought about going back to retail because the new 'bard' spec(i don't know the actual name) sounded dope, I love playing bards
[3:20:43] Dalsonson: There's also some edge cases where you want a gear set overstacked with Def so you can wear Frost or Shadow Res gear in ICC
[3:21:09] viirracocha: used to be 4 or 5?
[3:21:35] Dalsonson: Retail it's 3, Classic it's 2
[3:22:24] Mecabeast: 200 is 10m nax, and 225 is 10m ulduar
[3:22:25] GlitchedKrAken: GlitchedKrAken subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[3:22:30] Dalsonson: 1 piece is dropping Naxx 10m gear, the other is Uld 10m
[3:22:50] Dalsonson: And then Naxx 10m RAID is dropping Naxx 25m, same with Uld (barring hard modes)
[3:22:54] Rafaelfrost_: another leak kek
[3:22:54] Kinghorn: this was all preperation
[3:23:19] raldrik: open world affix HC mode seasons. That is a cool idea for classic +
[3:23:27] Mecabeast: red sword was removed in beta dungeons
[3:23:36] BenInYa: what weak aura is that in the bottom right?
[3:23:40] Dalsonson: Uhm, no lol. 2 pieces are 200, 1 will be a tier, 2 pieces will be 225, 1 will be tier
[3:23:57] Kriven: nothing like joining the stream just to hear "my pumpkins are out"
[3:24:08] ShroudedFoxx: Fun times
[3:24:42] RageerPLZ: New dungeon affix for classic plus Exburstive, a Burstive orb if not targetted in time explodes dealing damage but when you kill it the group get's a dot so you have to choose how many orbs you want to kill also stunning any mobs spawns a Exburstive orb (I can see this being a thing)
[3:25:16] Dalsonson: Nope. Run these enough, you can do ToGC. After a few weeks, THEN you can do ICC.
[3:25:32] Dalsonson: Unless you want to mindlessly get fucking stoned by farming Scourgestones to buy 245/252 pieces from the vendor
[3:26:07] teelegit: If you are a human, you can human racial out of it
[3:26:07] TheRonWeedsley: have u bought any of the tocg gear with scourgestones yet?
[3:26:27] Dalsonson: He is BElf @teelegit
[3:27:47] magemaster225: I think tokens are set per dungeon
[3:27:52] Dalsonson: All tier pieces can drop from end-of-dungeon bosses
[3:28:15] Dalsonson: It's all RNG
[3:28:17] Mecabeast: any token can drop from any end boss of the dungeons just rng
[3:28:27] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Dalsonson (warning)
[3:28:28] TheRonWeedsley: how many scourgestones do u have now?
[3:28:34] Kinghorn: pretty sure it is all RNG
[3:28:42] bypized: @Towelliee is Aug a must in the party on 10.2?
[3:28:57] TheRonWeedsley: there is a ring and cape from the new vendor
[3:28:59] Kriven: "Throne and Liberty ditches gacha business model for subs and passes" cool lets just hope the other changes they made are good

[3:30:04] Kinghorn: I have 4x portable holes
[3:30:07] vaironixx: nah the most inventory bloat was zerith mortis in shadowlands
[3:30:09] Kinghorn: no inventory issues lol
[3:30:16] Kinghorn: 25g
[3:31:14] bypized: Zerith Mortis was bad
[3:31:19] Kinghorn: feral druids are beasts now
[3:31:19] bypized: iventory wise
[3:31:24] Dalsonson: Towel, how many scourgestones do you have? There's a neat way to get 245 tier spamming Gamma dungeons
[3:31:26] Mystai: no tank or healer
[3:32:28] magemaster225: 38+ you get togc gear
[3:32:32] TheRonWeedsley: that vedor has good gear
[3:32:38] chinfu303: you can buy gear
[3:32:40] TheRonWeedsley: togc gear
[3:32:42] abbott012: 245 gear
[3:33:00] chinfu303: gamma dungeons
[3:33:02] magemaster225: 2 off each gamma boss
[3:33:03] Dalsonson: So 20 Scourgestone gets you a Trophy of the Crusade. Turning in a Trophy + 45 badges (Gloves and Shoulders) or 75 badges (Helm, Chest, Legs) gives you a 245 tier piece
[3:33:12] zeitgeiz: What prompted you to jump back into wrath lately? The dungeon changes fun?
[3:33:16] Dalsonson: Scourge drop off every Gamma boss at a 1:1 rate
[3:33:27] Beerplz: @Towelliee gamma dungeons drop scourgestones , and at the dalaran vendor gear , there is a specific vendor where you buy gear
[3:33:34] TheRonWeedsley: bracers cape and a ring
[3:33:45] Dalsonson: No Scourge from Libram, that is a Badge of Triumph thing
[3:33:57] gzus81: in a way ya
[3:33:58] Mecabeast: pretty much
[3:33:58] Beerplz: yeah
[3:33:59] Dalsonson: It's Dinar, but unlimited
[3:34:00] Kinghorn: yup

[3:53:10] Asuo_: Most decent tailors can recut anything. I've taken baseball jerseys to mine to get taken in
[3:53:40] Collected1: yeah tailoring is a forgotten skill
[3:53:51] FlameStryke: I bet you could get sponsored by a tailor and get to show off their awesome clothes, you got the gift of the gab you can do eet
[3:54:24] vetgamer23: rgjr2383 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[3:55:29] Collected1: Towelliee : did you see the recent developments with Pantheon?
[3:55:43] FlameStryke: you attack her and then her followers come up then you kill the one she marks
[3:55:52] FlameStryke: move out of the lightning
[3:55:53] teelegit: These dungeons (web wrap) everyone should just stack. Consecrate should break the web wraps anyway
[3:55:57] Collected1: yup the game
[3:56:01] BasedPennsylvania: that's why I love carhartt tshirts. their xl is most others xxl but way roomier in chest and shoulders.
[3:56:04] Collected1: and the pivot to a looter extraction game

[3:56:34] railander: he means tarkov
[3:56:38] PotbellyGoat: That game died when Brad died
[3:56:41] ElmSpace: like tarkov or dark and darker
[3:56:52] Collected1: tarkov using their MMO assets because it's easier to get out the door.
[3:56:54] KrakonSkullz: Everquest my alltime favorite MMO
[3:57:00] valianya: Looter extraction is like Tarkov and Dark and Darker
[3:57:01] bypized: Prolly like Diablo PVP
[3:57:08] railander: prob like dark and darker
[3:57:15] Brodih_: that would mean that the game will be pvp focused, which is a no no i think
[3:57:25] Mystai: what'd you die to
[3:57:37] railander: albion is full loot extraction-like
[3:57:51] liviu_81: with that  apsss, no fkin way kek
[3:57:59] Collected1: Cohh ain't happy lets put it that way. nor is anyone else over at the reddit. it's a last roll of the dice i suspect.
[3:58:01] ItsDerpDiggler: @Towelliee Nah they're doing it kind of like that but I guess it's more group based Raids with extraction.
[3:58:30] 91Niki: He's a producer @Towelliee
[3:58:45] Brodih_: Cohh is a big backer
[3:58:49] 91Niki: Also it's a single player game
[3:58:50] UtherBrexton: you would have to like it to the devs as well
[3:58:54] MrGattz: cohh is a producer
[3:58:59] valianya: Cohh producer of Emberville, not Pantheon
[3:59:01] 91Niki: Wait which game are we talking about ?
[3:59:03] Mr_Pennywise_: cohhD üéà
[3:59:06] HumblePeasnt: hes a backer for pantheon, producer on his own game
[3:59:07] Shrenko: Cohh is not a producer on pantheon
[3:59:12] Collected1: he invested but i get the feeling they didn't ask him.
[3:59:13] MrGattz: oh wait which game?
[3:59:14] Collected1: here's the vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mcLSEBo2-s
[3:59:26] 91Niki: I thought you guys were talking about Emberville
[3:59:31] MrGattz: what @HumblePeasnt said is correct
[3:59:31] EpicJune: i think he dipped from Pantheon since the changes
[3:59:36] Brodih_: yeah Cohh is a backer for pantheon, not producer
[4:00:11] Brodih_: he was hopping for a modern Everquest type game
[4:00:25] valianya: Cohh is backer, hyper of Pantheon, not official consultant I believe, but think hes done testing

[4:00:26] Ramdorpser: @Collected1 they just ruined the game with that
[4:00:53] Shrenko: I think we will see GTA6 before Pantheon
[4:00:55] Aidler: Brodih_ said it correctly
[4:00:55] kokochris: ouch that vid..
[4:01:05] ItsDerpDiggler: I just read and you start in "Terminus" where you can grab a quest to either begin a time based PvE or PvP quest that will load you into a PvE or PvP instance depending on what you chose. @Towelliee
[4:01:11] Sollice: I am surprised they would make that big of a change. Couldn't backers ask for a refund because it fundamentally isn't the game they invested money in
[4:01:28] amaceika: Its got armor. :D could be good for bear or DK?
[4:01:31] Shrenko: waait what happend with Pantheon?? oh noes NotLikeThis
[4:01:34] kokochris: @Sollice i know right
[4:01:36] sircheex: afaik it's just for a 'beta'
[4:01:41] Ramdorpser: What you doing in classic? Prepping for cata? Do you know something we don't? :)
[4:01:42] sircheex: maybe not a full pivot?
[4:01:49] FlameStryke: is this a "new toon"

[4:02:15] Shrenko: the video has 1.000 dislikes compared to 170 likes oof
[4:02:29] ItsDerpDiggler: @sircheex Yeah it looks like it's not changing the entire game. This is just a beta 24/7 environment for them to gather more data pre-release without having the entire world ready to be played in.
[4:02:31] Aidler: sneaky guys
[4:02:33] Korupcija_: speedrun, you've been here for 2 hours now KEKW
[4:02:37] GuardianKingXP: Wrath Dungeon M+
[4:02:43] FlameStryke: inc MC
[4:02:51] Brodih_: @Ramdorpser its the time travel event in retail
[4:02:53] Collected1: sircheex : yeah a few people said "it's just for beta, relax" but it's an entire new game mode. it's a waste of what limited resources they have.
[4:03:03] ItsDerpDiggler: @Towelliee From what it says this is just a "Beta" version they made to gather data and it's not a full game pivot.
[4:03:30] teelegit: @Towelliee Nexus has a 225 shield
[4:03:43] Sollice: Didn't think kind of thing happen to another MMO where they changed it to a BR
[4:03:54] ItsDerpDiggler: @Collected1 Maybe, they are a pretty ambitious studio though so hopefully this will help them gather data they needed for something we may not be aware of yet lol
[4:03:58] valianya: I think, the backers only legally entitled to refund if no product is made to releasable state, or if specific things listed in the funding drive aren't delivered
[4:04:19] amaceika: So much HP and strength
[4:04:21] Collected1: MrDerpDiggler : struggling to think of what data they need that they can't obtain just by letting people play the MMO
[4:05:06] Collected1: the new mode actually reminds me of Wayfinder

[4:05:36] ItsDerpDiggler: @Collected1 I think it's because the entire world still isn't ready and they needed a controlled and limited environment where they could specifically test PvE content and PvP content separately without having a full world map to play on.
[4:05:37] Mallaes: Clip of it?
[4:05:37] RuFFyLyx: the wrath experience
[4:05:38] pinkytoees: thats so messed up but thats wow for you

[4:06:49] Kinghorn: our wipes werent due to a 4200 tank
[4:06:57] Kinghorn: just dungeon mechanics we fucked up
[4:07:04] FlameStryke: of course those that do that get carried and then expect everyone to continue to carry them its fn dogshit
[4:07:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: trying to teach the dumbasses in my classic guild ulduar boss mechanics was exhausting
[4:07:25] kingdaddy96: Skill and solid rotation can make up for a pretty decent level deficit
