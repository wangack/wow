[5:23:44] tenmillion: Just bought last epoch the other day, its amazing. Perfect mix of PoE and Diablo
[5:24:09] cyrex172: @tenmillion i want to play it
[5:24:20] 91Niki: @NickLeonhearth I see a lot of people complain about that, but I think it's for immersion. It does have 3rd person elements tho. So when you climb up stuff and similar you see third person. Plenty of cut scenes too

[5:24:45] DrkPhoenix6913: i got it during the winter sale... ive gotten as far as installing it :P

[5:25:07] tenmillion: @cyrex172 for someone that likes the gameplay loop of D3, with more variability PoE offers, its a great game. Especially with D4 being a little raw still

[5:29:53] Hyelander_: Blizzard shouldve made pet battles mobile instead of the Rumble game
[5:30:30] 3663Sharad: I still play Rumble everyday. Didnt spend a dime so far
[5:30:34] Shrenko: a pet battle mobile game that was linked with World of warcraft progression would be awesome
[5:31:00] raymond3195: Rumble dying fast
[5:31:09] im_capy: Look at the Blizz mobile app, its take a long time to get even this far. Dunno why, but it has
[5:31:30] cynical_effect12: @Shrenko id get behind this
[5:31:31] Sollice: Why would you say Rumble dieing fast? You dont know that. Twitch viewership means very little
[5:31:40] im_capy: The Warcraft app needs some love too, has so much potential to be so much more
[5:31:44] Shrenko: Rumble is a game that is okay to play for yourself, but I didnt enjoy watching other play it to be honest
[5:31:55] RaginCajun05: hell just talk to the raid community
[5:32:18] Bernardo994: snap is pretty good like rumble
[5:32:38] im_capy: They did that little think in DF for rumble, stuff like that should keep going too

[5:33:56] im_capy: I wonder if they deal with the Candy Crush side of Management(mobile), Vs the standalones like Warcraft and D4
[5:34:09] cyrex172: yeah jarux

[5:34:32] Jarux34: WASD is nice
[5:34:44] im_capy: facts, WASD will let a lot of wow players play easier
[5:34:47] Hyelander_: I used to want WASD in diablo, until I connected my Xbox controller. now I dont care
[5:34:53] im_capy: that were put off before
[5:35:00] Shrenko: its gonna be weird for me walking with WASD while clicking 1234 etc. It works in WoW but I feel like it would be clunky in Diablo xD excited to try it out

[5:35:01] expbottles: bc ppl would rather listen to asmongold then try it for themselves lmao
