[1:02:22] Shadoww_Fox: total bulshit
[1:02:42] chronics0606: on PTR its about 22% less xp per lvl and quests give about 30 -40% more xp
[1:02:44] Shugaze: couple friends thought they had to pay to play tbc besides the sub
[1:02:55] Kayonne: Could it be a marketing strat to bait all the kids to think it is an actual "pass" just like a Battle Pass or something? Seems weird they don't just call it a Boost as usual... @Towelliee

[1:16:35] Yanzoh: New rooms looking so cool Tow!!
[1:16:38] No7AG4IN: Don’t. Complain pleas. Appreciate the fact that blizzard does this.
[1:16:50] dracullus: when they introduced race change?
[1:17:00] sprert: race change was wotlk
[1:17:05] lithium364: expect the datamined phoenix mounts during sl beta to be tbc store mounts for tier 5
[1:17:09] TGRippa_: wrath will be the full cash shop launch 100%
[1:17:15] Squirrel_nutty: the clone price is stupid
[1:17:18] Soproatlol: does tbc still have first to 70 level in achievement?
[1:17:19] cptnraz: 35 is just ridiculous...
[1:17:21] Vexxsis: @sprert doesnt matter when it came , the face is this is blizz now
[1:17:29] Vexxsis: fact*
[1:17:37] wthugy: 15 would be my max
[1:17:38] Anleus: what about 0 dollar
[1:17:41] Vexxsis: 35 is op
[1:17:43] Oriion_: Id be happy with 15 or 20
[1:17:44] TheUnknowing: I would have expected the cloning price be like 10 or 15 but blizz was like 'FULL THROTTLE BITCH'
[1:17:48] sprert: @Vexxsis someone asked when it were introduced
[1:17:52] Gizimoo86: 35$ doesnt help to keep wow alive or atleast classic
[1:17:55] Yanzoh: this isn't blizz dping, it's activision that's all EA like with the cash grabs
[1:17:59] wthugy: Ye one for your main 100%
[1:18:01] Chrissfrosty: doesnt it clone ur gold too?
[1:18:04] Anleus: you're already paying for like 60 days subs so why pay for character copies as well
[1:18:15] TGRippa_: @Chrissfrosty looks like it
[1:18:16] PieceOfPanic: EXACTLY
[1:18:22] cptnraz: Might be that they shock us with a high price to later lower it and we will be more "acceptable" that it even costs money.
[1:18:23] uberhart: when do they plan to activate server transfer again? don't konw how fun will a launch be, on a pvp server.
[1:18:39] Oriion_: They dont want to split the player base more.
[1:18:47] dracullus: maybe they want to die out and restart with fresh serwers few years from now
[1:19:00] Soproatlol: they are gonna close classic when wrath launches
[1:19:01] Domi98_: they are killing classic
[1:19:01] Vexxsis: expansion price
[1:19:13] Gizimoo86: i would play classic, havent event dont AQ or pvp ranks but now going to wait and see does classic die before paying 35$

[1:19:48] Anleus: they could've literally just made us pay again for a game that came out in 2007 LUL
[1:19:50] Cilir: just nothing but them being greedy
[1:19:52] dracullus: @wthugy yeah there is version without boost
[1:19:57] Sloksen: We pay the value of the service.
[1:19:58] northern__soul: I cant afford to talk all my toons over :(

[1:20:08] sprert: BTW, i looked at the PTR and the goblin town in duskwallow is available in the pre-patch(with quests and all)
[1:20:09] ghostdogeu: but ye classic will just be dead
[1:20:09] mkooodooo: @Anleus 2004
[1:20:18] lithium364: so shitty cant even buy the phase hunter mount solo in the store
[1:20:18] Gizimoo86: Also cloning is for the same server, if server dies i doubt they offer free tansfers
[1:20:23] TGRippa_: i would have paid $40 for TBC Classic, but I will pay $0 for cloning my char, boosts etc, they went about it all wrong
[1:20:25] Anleus: tbc is 2007
[1:20:33] Kinghorn: nice sprert that is some good exp
[1:20:54] northern__soul: @tgrippa_ me too
[1:20:54] Svendv: i think classic will be death anyway, even with free copy
[1:20:58] PieceOfPanic: i dont get the whole micro-transaction with classics, those games were already paid for once 14-16 years ago. By us...
[1:21:15] PieceOfPanic: like we forgot it LUL
[1:21:27] cptnraz: Its not even "micro"-transactions anymore its macrotransactions now.
[1:21:29] Shadoww_Fox: well...not here in Brazil :( Blizzard killed the Brazilian community.. when they raise the prizes of all services and the monthly payment... its sad
[1:21:46] PieceOfPanic: @cptnraz agreed
[1:21:51] Oriion_: Charge the sweaties for fresh servers.
[1:21:54] Gizimoo86: @Svendv of course dead some point but not for years but this 35$ is bad
[1:22:03] TGRippa_: @cptnraz 100% - micro transaction is $1-$5 max

[1:23:14] ghostdogeu: can you boost a paladin?
[1:23:15] zodd_amhai: tbh the boost is way cheaper than retail considering /played required @Towelliee

[1:23:25] kochiee: kochiee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! shelves are looking dope tow!
[1:23:26] Eras25: Deluxe edition should include Shadowlands
[1:23:28] PieceOfPanic: @towelliee well, one of Blizzard code of coduct is "play nice, play fair". But there's nothing fair by putting players apart, based on their irl financial situation.
[1:23:36] Gizimoo86: 35$ doesnt make sense if people dont play and pay sub its less overall
[1:23:38] Kinghorn: $55 for the boost and a month of game time
[1:23:46] Kinghorn: 15 for mounts and toys
[1:23:47] No7AG4IN: Blizzard  is stupid rich why not have 5 mil people subbing to pay it all for 14 dollars a month.
[1:23:48] broopyd: Compared to other blizzard services it's definitely priced fairly - wether the services overall are overpriced is a different argument
[1:23:50] uberhart: yeah, don't konw why people think that mount, and boost ruin the experience
[1:23:51] niebvelungen: 2 mounts
[1:23:57] niebvelungen: bc and retaiil
[1:24:05] Vexxsis: @Svendv i liked classic to a degree. It started my mmo journey but bc was great
[1:24:11] Jokervenom1978: it seems like a good value to me
[1:24:11] zodd_amhai: when can we buy?
[1:24:22] No7AG4IN: 14 mil x 5 mil people a month.
[1:24:41] No7AG4IN: Easy math.
[1:24:42] PieceOfPanic: ^
[1:24:44] Svendv: @Vexxsis i liked BC and WotLK the most
[1:24:44] Gizimoo86: I am just waiting to pay clone, if they dont care merge servers etc. and its dying not going to clone

[1:25:27] broopyd: @Volly It's just not greed though, if you add up 30 days gametime, a character boost, 2 toys and a mount it comes out way more then 70 dollars.

[1:25:54] Broomba: That was mentioned at blizzcon 3 months ago

[1:26:41] shale93: I have 200g on my warrior, quit in P2 its little sad
[1:26:42] TGRippa_: i would have liked 1 fresh server at least, but yeah i can see the logic
[1:26:43] PieceOfPanic: I dont know dude, i think blizzard is going too far lately.
[1:26:45] Merzerker: thought normal flying was 500g

[1:28:20] Mograim: hey towelliee, is there a room tour vid somewhere?
[1:28:21] mandalorianzz: We’re the corporate tax payers of Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill - WoW subs are so low that it has to be called MAU across all activision blizzard games - copy character for free onto PTR since vanilla 2004, now have to pay $35 - too make up the difference of WoW sub taxes
[1:28:22] niebvelungen: gold is ez to make in classic too
[1:28:31] oSirKnight: oSirKnight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months!

[1:29:42] TGRippa_: token already on the chinese version i believe
[1:29:42] paradoxyy: surely will
[1:30:02] MetallicusGaming: I'd rather farm gold on BC for a token then on SL
[1:30:05] Aquadriel: classic got what they wanted, old game brought to modern gaming lirikCAPPY
[1:30:19] TGRippa_: yeah, they have the code ready to go, blizzard will do it no doubt
[1:30:19] paradoxyy: CLassic wrath: BUY SHADOWMOURNE at blizzard store now only for 199.99!!!
[1:30:25] snuffles_80: Im so casual I need that token :)

[1:31:40] hiddukeld: people need to respect themselves a bit more lmao
[1:32:03] Rudric_Ice: We need a Horror game from blizzard
[1:32:13] Roughneck124: How’s your dogecoin this morning
[1:32:27] TGRippa_: tbh if u are serious about TBC, all u need is the sub and u can skip all the cash shop stuff
[1:32:28] sweetiepiles: LULW
[1:32:35] Spaede: I excited for when the streamers who’ve been ripping the store show up on a void stalker lol
[1:32:39] TGRippa_: and jsut laugh at all the booster noobs who dont realise what attunements are
[1:32:43] fewyn: musk was on SNL
[1:32:45] Kale_Nd: 0.47
[1:32:47] fewyn: and it crashed
[1:32:54] geokouts: It bombed badly
[1:33:19] fewyn: gonna buy a little more on the dip
[1:33:24] Lith0n: Any word on fresh classic servers? Guessing not with pushing TBC
[1:33:25] Baron_Pandacula: The only thing i am mad about is the void stalker having 100% movement speed at lvl 40
[1:33:27] fewyn: yeah he mentioned it but i didn't watch
[1:33:57] damianpaladin: I feel like some people buy things due to the fear of missing out even if it's something they "morally" disagree with. If someone strives to get everything, they may be more inclined to buy the Deluxe Edition.
[1:34:07] Broomba: What movie did u see? @towelliee
[1:34:07] Holysal: what's with that offline server?
[1:34:16] TheUnknowing: tbc will get fresh when wrath comes out lol

[1:43:04] Oriion_: AYAYAY
[1:43:09] Gizimoo86: New world was decent, but that laggy animation lock combat and end game content was lacking maybe they fix it

[1:43:54] dragin1320: @Towelliee did you get the recent New world alpha? any intention to try that again?
[1:44:02] Shenkie1: what about wildstar

[1:49:41] Awoll: No NDA on the preview
[1:49:42] ArcaneSyntax: the complainers on the classic wow reddit were saying tbcc was releasing early to compete with aoc alpha on june 1st.
[1:49:51] Alienfromger: so thats why tbc release is on 1st june? fear of AOC LUL
[1:49:53] tron3kk: Well happy mothers day claireEh claireEh claireEh claireBye

[1:49:57] RecklessMoviez: @Towelliee uuuh damn - your room looks siick now!!
[1:49:58] stjon13: Blizz really needs a fire lit under their ass Really...
[1:50:07] ShadoodHD: me tired, me want to know how everyone's life is going
[1:50:09] AlexSinclair: it was not planned, blizz just likes to fuck other mmos
[1:50:12] TGRippa_: i think blizz just wanted to count their cash shop sales for this financial year
[1:50:24] Murphybrown: got FF fanfest on 14/15 too
[1:50:32] dragin1320: Blizz always does that its not out of fear
[1:50:47] Alexkayzz: DansGame
[1:50:48] nightmayor12: I'm not bringing this up to be a troll or anything, but I am having a hard time understanding why people are upset about the Portal pass.
[1:50:58] Squirrel_nutty: allergies getting ya Towelliee ?
[1:51:02] HypnosTheHero: So TBC and classic will be separate servers now?
[1:51:05] ArcaneSyntax: gonna log in, immediately get DW on my shaman and throw my 2h in the trash where it belongs.
[1:51:09] zodd_amhai: no one cares about FF LULW
[1:51:10] warrenny: @stjon13 Wtf you on about?
[1:51:13] TGRippa_: @nightmayor12 mixture of no changes and extortionate passing my guess
[1:51:22] WhiteKnight74648: @zodd_amhai correction you dont.
[1:51:22] TGRippa_: pricing*
[1:51:34] zodd_amhai: @WhiteKnight74648 ah id say most WoW players dont
[1:51:36] Gizimoo86: @HypnosTheOne yes you need to choose which one, or if want both need to pay 35$ per character
[1:51:46] feelswyzman: i would buy the deluxe edition if it included shadowlands also
[1:51:58] WhiteKnight74648: @zodd_amhai you be surprised. but yeah i can see alot of wow players not getting into FF
[1:51:59] ZakuzaGB: i think the clone price is a bit much but they could have easily just not offered that option
[1:52:15] stjon13: Blizz needs some real game changing competition to lite that fire under their ass

[1:52:16] tron3kk: heal me asmonFiend
[1:52:26] warrenny: @zakuzagb Ehh they could have given it the level boostprice
[1:52:28] Oriion_: let me buy tokens until im poor
[1:52:29] Oriion_: im old
[1:52:35] MleveK: Why does the Portal Pass say "UP TO" 4 Runecloth bag. is it RNG or something? You get 1 bag, you get 4??
[1:52:37] ArcaneSyntax: the CE should include like base edition SL, that would be nice
[1:52:41] Aquadriel: if anything TBC boost is super cheap. Max said it last night, on retail you pay 60 bucks for saving 12 hour of time, on TBC pay 40 to save 100 hours of time. @Towelliee
[1:52:45] TGRippa_: I think ppl are just worried it devalues their achievement or something like that
[1:53:00] average_j4y: @Towelliee some people just have be mad about something at all times
[1:53:02] ZakuzaGB: i saw some people in the wowhead comments getting really mad cos they thought they had to pay 70 to play bc haha
[1:53:03] MrKhanes: We dont really know the prices for other regions, EU Aus and so on. So for me i dont know how to feel about the prices yet.
[1:53:07] Jokervenom1978: I expected the boost to be 60 bucks tbh.
[1:53:07] Holysal: it's like the gold farming bots. they complain and still buy from the bots lol
[1:53:11] uxibixu: Give them a finger and they take your hand
[1:53:17] nightmayor12: imagine a software develpment company wanting to charge money for their work.
[1:53:18] TGRippa_: but honestly it doesnt really give u a fully ready char, the stuff included with the level 58 is a bit of a meme anyway
[1:53:21] Moh_Toh: They just jump on the bandwagon cause there favorite streamer is bitching about it
[1:53:27] LordgeAlucard: the name is misleading
[1:53:29] sifer007: Blizzard is milking us
[1:53:31] LordgeAlucard: and they know that
[1:53:34] warrenny: @nightmayor12 How terrible it. Should be free
[1:53:34] pleasureman030: will you be able to buy the boost on prepatch?
[1:53:41] AlexSinclair: @mrj0n3s i think we are at the 2 hands, 2 legs and they want our torso next

[1:53:48] nightmayor12: @warrenny LUL
[1:53:48] Spaede: I’m cool with the $40, finally something to use retail boosting gold on
[1:53:49] warrenny: Any eu prices yet
[1:53:52] Mallaes: Can't wait for Northrend pass in a few years coxDerp
[1:53:53] LordgeAlucard: people are gonna buy it thinking its for TBC access
[1:54:03] MrKhanes: @warrenny Not yet i wonder the same
[1:54:06] Kingstone23: doesn't the deluxe edition contain the mount and the talent to be able to use it? ( or was it in the pass )
[1:54:17] zeldris5085: screw the gear, the lvls are what is EZ mode
[1:54:22] Zlaark: @warrenny just replace dollar with euro :)

[1:54:39] ArcaneSyntax: @whiteknight74648 nope
[1:54:44] Gizimoo86: I remember leveling BC prot paladin from 60-63 lvl it was slow and i played REtri to 70
[1:54:53] warrenny: @mrkhanes really need a mount on my mage
[1:55:04] PixelNites: prot paladin will be a god in leveling dungeons
[1:55:08] AlexSinclair: @Kingstone23 deluxe contains the mount, if you boost you get the first raiding skill, but if you dont boost then you have to buy skills ingame and the mount adapts to your riding skill
[1:55:11] Kingstone23: @ArcaneSyntax @MetallicusGaming oh, ok. Was watching Asmongold's and he was mentioning something about getting the skill with it
[1:55:37] MrKhanes: @warrenny I dont know if will buy anything yet, but yeah i want to know how much it will cost in euro, sence its huge diffrence bethwheen euro and usd for me as a Swede.
[1:55:39] Gizimoo86: @PixelNites  yeah prot better if do dungeons but for quests slow
[1:55:40] agnarz: no one wants to level lmao
[1:55:45] ravenwingz0405: preach that truth!!!
[1:55:52] ArcaneSyntax: @kingstone23 asmon was full of crap, the mount scales to riding level, that all. saves you about 90g at 60.
[1:55:53] tron3kk: what shooo say HahaShrugLeft asmonFiend
[1:55:55] ZakuzaGB: does people buying it still mean the price is fine?
[1:55:58] AlexSinclair: thats because WoW has millions of players and the ones complaining are not the ones buying the boost/deluxes
[1:56:07] sifer007: world o crackcraft
[1:56:11] hickster1992: Your right man nail on the head
[1:56:16] munny23: munny23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months!

[1:56:46] Eviltuna13: kinda like talking shit about the game all day every day and still play it? rooThink
[1:56:48] suavo_: people saying the boosts will ruing the game are severely out of touch
[1:56:55] nightmayor12: have we comfirmed that prepatch leveling will get a tad easier?
[1:57:01] Kingstone23: @Kingstone23 oh, yeah, something like that, but you can get the boost through the pass, right?
[1:57:05] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee i cant believe people actually though the mount was gonna give people 100% mount speed at level 40.
[1:57:21] warrenny: @nightmayor12 Its got the xps nerfs and stuff yes
[1:57:21] MrKhanes: @warrenny yeah i think something like that aswell, but you never know they could do 70 USD =70 Euro, but i dont think so, but you never know.
[1:57:32] CritcobainTV: HeyGuys
[1:57:33] Murphybrown: If they made old transmogs and titles apply to retail after earning, I'd be playing all kinds of classic
[1:57:35] stjon13: but if you listen to the AOC creator, his take on MMo cash grabs pay to win etc. is do refreshing
[1:57:37] CritcobainTV: Morning hammer squad
[1:57:40] Kingstone23: @ArcaneSyntax Yeah, I guess. Didn't really have that much time to get a character to level 60 on classic, so I'm not sure how bad the economy is in it
[1:57:43] warrenny: @mrkhanes theyve never done that in the past right?
[1:57:44] nightmayor12: @warrenny Tyvm
[1:58:01] Frost_Fang94: how do you feel about them fixing slave pens?
[1:58:10] MrKhanes: Not what i remember @warrenny

[1:58:16] aeyt: KEKW
[1:58:21] Drogdorf: AOC is a litteral cashgrab OMEGALUL
[1:58:23] Aquadriel: nice info KEKW
[1:58:26] warrenny: @nightmayor12 At least based on the yt vid i watched earlier
[1:58:31] LordgeAlucard: 500 to QA test our game...
[1:58:31] zeldris5085: which game?
[1:58:33] Gizimoo86: Cash shop is huge
[1:58:36] stjon13: it's cosmetics only
[1:58:38] ZakuzaGB: AOC gives me star citizen vibes ngl
[1:58:38] zeldris5085: oh ashes
[1:58:42] TheUnknowing: thats all aoc is at the moment
[1:58:44] Aquadriel: stjon13 so is wows?
[1:58:46] zeldris5085: thought you were talking about the government chick
[1:58:48] LordgeAlucard: they  wont even hire QA testers
[1:58:49] ttmaker: aoc gonna fail miserably
[1:58:51] LordgeAlucard: lul
[1:58:53] Alienfromger: like star scamming?
[1:58:55] warrenny: But stores only bad in wow
[1:58:57] lithium364: star citizen shopitems for 4000 dollars LUL
[1:58:58] Darzetti_: thats still a cash shop
[1:59:00] MuttonChopins: might as well make it f2p with all of that
[1:59:06] stjon13: no box price
[1:59:06] HypnosTheHero: I heard some thing about you can pay 500 dollars to play the alpha preview LUL
[1:59:09] AlexSinclair: @stjon13 cosmetics are very important in an MMO, why do you think people farm mounts and armor
[1:59:09] suavo_: new world better than aoc 100%
[1:59:15] Sh4nti: AOC is the new Scam Citizen OMEGALUL
[1:59:26] zarod89: New World looks alot more promising
[1:59:30] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee you fail to see the cash shop is only bad in wow and only wow
[1:59:43] Gizimoo86: Same for Star Citizen if they deliver 50 % its huge
[1:59:59] valth: Morning all!
[2:00:22] Eviltuna13: @ArcaneSyntax how is the cash shop bad in WoW? is it bacause of the token system?

[2:00:23] LGilbert1982: When I heard that other players can destroy what you've worked to build, I lost interest. Will be far too much griefing in that game.
[2:00:57] AlexSinclair: @ArcaneSyntax cash shops are bad in every game, they devalue players achievements and collections. and eventually they will become more important then every other system to the devs
[2:00:58] tron3kk: 40 is huge HahaShrugLeft asmonGASM
[2:01:04] Murphybrown: AOC gonna be the western version of BDO but with trinity class system
[2:01:14] dracullus: @Towelliee FFXIV fanboys don't really mention their shop either
[2:01:25] Broomba: you listen to asmon you wouldnt wont know that cause he ignores that but whines about wow and its shop -- no logical there
[2:01:25] Gizimoo86: AOC cash shop going to be full of house custimization etc.

[2:01:48] stjon13: I's rather have a sub
[2:01:48] warrenny: @broomba You listen to asmon youre kinda past logic

[2:02:36] Gizimoo86: Oh they referal system, I made like 500$ of ships in Star cTizen from youtube referals
[2:03:07] Glenfy: The referal link has been from the beguining @Towelliee
[2:03:21] ZakuzaGB: i mean have you seen his house
[2:03:27] ZakuzaGB: its got marble walls and shit
[2:03:34] AlexSinclair: @ArcaneSyntax so you dont think the mounts in the shop are more unique than most ingame obtainable mounts, or that it has slowly grown over the years, or that soon it will have more transmog added

[2:04:12] Gizimoo86: too defensive maybe he's protection specced
[2:04:15] lithium364: lmao its like from simpsons where stan lee sneaks into comic shops to replace dc comics with his own
[2:04:22] stjon13: taking the NDA sown this early means alot to me
[2:04:44] stjon13: down*
[2:04:49] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee it took me like an hour and half to do that ghouls quest when i did it.
[2:05:50] thefatCheetah: them shelves
[2:06:14] Glenfy: What I don't understand is, AoC has been updating monthly all the things they do, why peopple hate so much and talking so much shit about something you can know if you look what they are showing each month
[2:06:31] stjon13: sounds like alot of confidence to me

[3:25:42] Ghoost172: Theres alot more to do. but you are able to do everything when you want kinda
[3:25:45] 91Niki: I feel like you can always play wow casually, no matter what exp. As long as you don't set yourself more expectations than you can meet, on that casual level.
[3:26:00] Radtvlol: morning folks
[3:26:03] 91Niki: There is always something to do
[3:26:20] Dutch_van_der_Linde: @Ghoost172 That actually sounds good. I was afraid that I can't achieve anything meaningful cause I can't play that much nowadays

[3:27:01] CohBonkers: bigpap16Yo bigpap16Yo
[3:27:01] Domini1001: Dutch_van_der_Linde: listen you gonna have a lot more ways to improve your character than in classic, for example one of the coolest ways to get gear in TBC is proffessions those are long grind but still availbale for casual player you alawys have something to work towards
[3:27:11] yunitoYuniro: It’s the same with heartstone tournaments with viewership
[3:27:15] Inthezonewow: Hire him LUL
[3:27:17] Shrenko: they arent using much probably, just look at the prize pools
[3:27:22] Pannekaker: YouTube was a big mistake for Activision
[3:27:35] Aierwin: Advertisement would do a lot for them, so would a larger prize pool.
[3:27:49] SmokedHog: all the players play on twitch, youtube just alienates potential viewers moving easily to their twitch stream
[3:27:59] DreamWebb: i dont think they care its tokenistic they make way more money through other avenues of WoW
[3:28:05] Domini1001: Dutch_van_der_Linde: heroic dungs arent super casual friendly cuase they are annyoing sometimes however you feel accomplished when you finish it :)

[5:11:31] wowaddonsez: out of the gate, t3 warriors will be the #1 tanks in heroics
[5:11:39] wowaddonsez: out of the gate, fury warriors do insane damage too
[5:11:40] Wildside1177: Warriors are awesome in PvP in BC. Hit like trucks.
[5:11:41] mrelgaato: prots are nice
[5:11:43] NickLeonhearth: if you are a warrior, you will be playing arms in 2s with a druid, that is your life in TBC :D
[5:11:49] kamisengames: you have 1 for MS that is all, usually an off tank
[5:11:52] KombatWombat07: warriors are needed to battleshout the hunters :D
[5:11:58] joeyot_: always need one arms warrior
[5:12:08] Dirtymikeandthaboyzz: Ok ty that’s great to know so what dps class u think will be pretty solid throughout the whole expansion?
[5:12:24] wowaddonsez: yeah but u need alot of gear to get crush capped, they will hit it sooner able to tank bosses faster
[5:12:38] rosina_scarlett: yea there was a draft
[5:12:40] Wildside1177: I am boosting a wrrior just for PvP.
[5:12:44] Brutefiend: Brutefiend subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[5:12:44] Holysal: yeah no warriors were picked
[5:12:47] KombatWombat07: NONE of the warriors were drafted that day
[5:12:54] MrKhanes: yeah they used something called snake draft
[5:12:55] Finsby_: Yea. there was a draft and an excess of players to be picked from
[5:12:57] Mythos_Chamber: Yeah, I think only rogues were taken for melee
[5:13:00] shale93: yeah even xaryu was passed lol
[5:13:02] rosina_scarlett: the only classes taken were Lock, Mage, Rogue KEKW
[5:13:05] Wildside1177: The draft was poorly done. The tournament was good but the draft was badly done.
[5:13:10] rosina_scarlett: for dps
[5:13:10] Shrenko: Sadge
[5:13:18] joe_g_433: Yea Xaryu didn’t get picked either...
[5:13:20] Wildside1177: 1 priest
[5:13:24] iamdrud: 1 shaman
[5:13:28] iamdrud: 1 hunter too i think
[5:13:39] HopeThePriest: there were mages in the final
[5:13:53] Sediz: some of the teamleaders were priests though, were more than 1 priest in total
[5:14:04] SilkeySmooth: lock rogue is all you will see in arena and it's why I won't do arena
[5:14:11] remitis: hello  :)
[5:14:15] Wildside1177: Draft is better than premade teams. The play was a lot better. No team absolutely dominated as would happen with premade teams.
[5:14:15] rosina_scarlett: SLSL lock is dumb in arena's
[5:14:16] wowaddonsez: umm what about frost mages? @SilkeySmooth
[5:14:18] KombatWombat07: World of Lockcraft
[5:14:24] dreioo: @remitis how dare you :)
[5:14:27] Yagr6: @Towelliee so TBC was mathed out to the max? any chance for some new builds to be found?
[5:14:53] chintzypop: Did tbc hunter have the dead zone?
[5:14:59] SilkeySmooth: no one will have gear in bgs that's where the real pvp will be
[5:14:59] wowaddonsez: gladiator gates yup
[5:14:59] Wildside1177: I think a lot of people are overestimating how important the meta is in PvE. Anything works.
[5:15:05] rosina_scarlett: @chintzypop yes
[5:15:11] NILLme: tourney was in blue 70 pvp gear.. wait till everyone have S3 or S4 gear. You cant burst people this fast
[5:15:12] warrenny: Like with groups when classic released?
[5:15:16] Artivicii: @chintzypop 8yards
[5:15:21] HCTechPat: Players and Blizzard can do whatever they want as I don't play WoW mwahahaha
[5:15:36] dreioo: @Towelliee show us the LOL hills <3
[5:15:37] wowaddonsez: people will literally make 3 toons and do arena on them to artificially inflate the required rating to get glad, u will have to face the same guy on 3 teams
[5:15:47] NovaSun84: Venruki got rolled unfortunately... he got mage and paired with resto sham and shadow priest.  Lock/anything just wrecked him

[5:16:13] Wildside1177: They had about 300 resil in the tournament. Venruki showed his gear.
[5:16:18] Artivicii: true, resilience was a dope ass stat imo
[5:16:20] NILLme: Ven's combo was weird
[5:16:21] SilkeySmooth: all you really need is 1700 that's like a 5% difference in stats.
[5:16:30] wowaddonsez: if you stacked resil on beta, you could get over 400 resil but it was not optimal
[5:17:04] dcmaniac11: Towel if I’m already level 60 and just waiting for release is there anything I need to do in pre patch or can just take time off until release
[5:17:11] Artivicii: towJoe

[5:17:31] warrenny: One letter wrong i get cannabis search instead of tbc 😂
[5:17:41] KombatWombat07: is 399 resil optimal?
[5:17:42] mediocre_merrak_: back in TBC I was in an all elemental shaman 3v3 arena team. chain lightning and bloodlust for days! enemies melted.

[5:17:43] Wildside1177: Apparently abiout 270 resil with raid gear is best. But I am just repeating what I heard a PvP dude say.
[5:17:44] Artivicii: @warrenny 4Head
[5:18:09] Artivicii: @Wildside1177 pretty much true, i think some healers shot for 280
[5:18:11] SilkeySmooth: @dcmaniac11 you can farm marks of honor for lvl 70 blue pvp gear they take about 40 marks of heac

[5:18:46] rosina_scarlett: hes the only one I knew LUL
[5:18:53] rosina_scarlett: druid

[6:27:45] toobaked1987: AoC dude might be a millionaire fan, but he is smart in seeing you cant print money with cosmetics. He has an agenda. Pass.
[6:27:51] Broomba: AoC and its shop might cause asmon to go completely bald
[6:27:56] toobaked1987: Can print*
[6:28:12] Nico_vdM: What about the avenger's shield reset one?
[6:29:10] NovaSun84: Blizzard could put this all in the real game and people would still complain about it not being enough LULW

[6:30:30] Blvdman: wait AoC has a cash shop?
[6:30:35] Broomba: concept and possible lore and questing in AoC looks insteresting but on the fence
[6:30:35] NovaSun84: yup, there are too many mental gymnastics to make that statement work
[6:30:36] warrenny: @novasun00 That explains the forums. Then 😂
[6:30:38] dalaraz: yy that title was horrble
[6:30:43] mr_drewc26: First stream with new set up???
[6:30:53] toobaked1987: TBC cost nothing but a sub. Its our choice to pay Blizzard more money to enjoy a past experience.
[6:30:58] Sonatta: classic andys should be all about that reroll life
[6:31:02] purpgarma: Pretty sure a lot of people completely misunderstood the character clone thing
[6:31:18] dalaraz: you wanting to pay 35$ for 4 chars so you have em on both versions,is your choice,tbc is just a sub cost
[6:31:21] zuru35: Asmon is just bugging out because positivity dosent sell these days, people eat up all negative shit. He still is gonna play the game and call it shit.
[6:31:32] NovaSun84: warrenny towDerp
[6:31:43] ShaunsterTheMonster: Yup
[6:31:58] toobaked1987: Its 100% true. Blizzard is in no way making you pay more of your hard earned money to enjoy the experience
[6:32:10] NovaSun84: Correct, you got it now
[6:32:10] Aravarth: I mean, it's no added cost if you all ready maintain your wow subscription playing Retail
[6:32:35] Snilleblixten92: im so happy i entered this stream and heard that. :p
[6:32:36] Sonatta: i don't understand why someone would want to be locked in a classic forever server with a max level character and max progression
[6:32:45] Democritus33: 35$ to play classic on top of 15/mo is INSANE!
[6:32:46] mause10: nice background you've got :D
[6:32:56] Elementlolz1: is that madseason clip?
[6:32:59] alundrius: inflammaoty title
[6:33:00] toobaked1987: Asmon should just change his name to Asmonelluar.
[6:33:03] Goblinemporium: I was about to say that LULW
[6:33:05] Aravarth: @Sonatta I imagine it would be worth IF they made Classic servers have "seasons" with resets
[6:33:05] NovaSun84: LULW
[6:33:06] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @towelliee I think asmon's "finest" moment was on stream when he had a near sky is falling melt down during BFA because google search trends for "World of Warcraft" plummeted and he thought WoW was dying, because people weren't googling it as much...
[6:33:08] zuru35: Im personally buying the deluxe edition because I look at it as a "collectors" item, I have all the other collections editions so why not
[6:33:09] oldmangamer0: I stopped watching him
[6:33:09] WowItsFrostyLOL: Asmongold doesent directly control the AsmongoldTV channel. His editors kinda messed that video up with the title.
[6:33:13] Wildside1177: EEmotional delusion roller coaster with Asmond.
[6:33:16] 770Cash: i cant stand the incessant hate for the game lol
[6:33:20] Nico_vdM: The king is dead, all hail the king
[6:33:32] 210Crawler: towHesaidit
[6:33:38] NovaSun84: It's Asmongold's video, end of sentence... Regardless of an editor or whatever.
[6:33:46] dalaraz: its not clickbait,its just wrong
[6:33:50] NovaSun84: He has creative control over that shit.  Its his shit
[6:33:51] Sonatta: @Aravarth even if they did seasonal play, a max level character with max progression wouldn't be part of seasonal play
[6:33:54] Broomba: does he say in the video thats 35 to play bc?
[6:34:03] warrenny: Same @towelliee
[6:34:06] alundrius: ad'al statue would be sweeet
[6:34:08] toobaked1987: Asmon has realized he gets more views with Blizzard hate titles instead of giving correct information.
[6:34:09] gfield2k: That's why I don't listen to other peoples judgement on video games.
[6:34:12] Snilleblixten92: is the char boost only from the delux edition of Dark Portal Pass?
[6:34:25] Broomba: factually incorrect
[6:34:28] NovaSun84: LULW Fake news
[6:34:30] warrenny: Buying deluxe for sure
[6:34:32] shimwood: Portal Pass has the boost
[6:34:34] Goblinemporium: He'll pay for the deluxe and pretend he never said anything about it
[6:34:35] Aravarth: which is the best kind of incorrect
[6:34:37] SamDavidsin: @Broomba its not $35 to play tbc, its 35 to save a clone to classic server
[6:34:49] Arocian: portal hearth
[6:34:54] Broomba: @SamboDavidson but his title is 35 to  play bc
[6:34:54] Snilleblixten92: yea
[6:34:59] NovaSun84: I really hope they don't change what comes in Deluxe on may 18th
[6:35:01] Eternaalll: portal and illidan flame iirc
[6:35:04] NovaSun84: 30 days gametime included
[6:35:04] WowItsFrostyLOL: My problem is, yeah it gives you 70 dollars of cosmetics that are worth probably 100, but I would have just preferred a hard copy and a statue for 100. 70 bucks is still a lot to spend for just cosmetics even if it’s a good deal.
[6:35:06] Snilleblixten92: 1 ark portal 1 one burn from feet runing
[6:35:10] Snilleblixten92: dark*
[6:35:16] SamDavidsin: @Broomba o ya, thats wrong
[6:35:22] warrenny: @snilleblixten92 Both in bc?
[6:35:23] dalaraz: the only weird thing is it gives you a shadowlands mount in a tbc bundle but not the shadowlands expansion
[6:35:44] Eternaalll: @Towelliee i assume the TBC mount will be char bound and not acc wide?
[6:35:47] NovaSun84: IMO any package should include 30 days gametime.
[6:35:52] Aravarth: as much as Bobby Kotick is scum, I think that Blizzard has really mastered the game of getting people to pay extra money out of pocket for cosmetics
[6:35:52] AcidAbyss: So on may 18th will it be a fresh new game and you will have to get your character names again?
[6:35:58] Snilleblixten92: the 2 toys is 1 Dark Portal toy and 1 "Burning Rush" type of toy for bc
[6:35:59] warrenny: @eternaalll All should get it
[6:36:02] Snilleblixten92: i think
[6:36:12] purpgarma: @AcidAbyss no fresh servers afaik
[6:36:12] gfield2k: I've been playing since 2004. So I really don't care
[6:36:19] Broomba: he might end up the way of healsvsbabyface
[6:36:28] toobaked1987: Blizzard has no mastered it. Riot has mastered cosmetics for large amounts of profit.

[6:36:57] Sam_Nash: I was lucky enough to get that mount when I played
[6:37:05] Katzushirou: @alluza it scales with your riding skill
[6:37:09] dalaraz: another thing is,crying a whole day for the 35$ tag and in the end admiting you will buy it anyway,its extra silly
[6:37:27] NovaSun84: The retail one for sure
[6:37:27] Aravarth: @Novasun00 Yes, it is, that was ZA
[6:37:29] uberhart: hmm, where do you learn jewelcrafting before tbc(0-300)?
[6:37:36] Snilleblixten92: @alluza u get for every char but the epic riding u have to learn first befor it upgrades to 100%. it can be used for both 60 and 100% but u need to learn epic riding first
[6:37:37] NovaSun84: For TBC... think its jsut whatever 1 person you choose
[6:37:47] Aravarth: @uberhart In silvermoon I imagine
[6:37:56] Aravarth: Or the exodar if you're a spacegoat
[6:37:58] Broomba: for me -- its 100% TBC on all my toons
[6:38:03] NovaSun84: Aravarth that's sick.  LF4M ZA need carry
[6:38:09] alluza: not worth to pay the money for it then
