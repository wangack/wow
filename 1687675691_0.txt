[0:57:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think paladins have to get gripped
[0:57:46] Davedaman26: From what Sloot said in his stream last night they aren't raiding today or tomorrow.
[0:57:47] ThePawPaw: 5-10 fps nice LUL
[0:57:50] Holysal: evoker have to save priests and pallies since they cant deal with the knock
[0:58:01] LoseAlotLuke: you and lula all set for tomorrow?
[0:58:06] PigPenLen: portal is easier

[0:59:08] Kinghorn: LUL
[0:59:19] Kinghorn: yeah I was watching too
[0:59:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: The analysts and weak aura people make a difference, too
[0:59:21] AustinOranje: big true
[0:59:30] Davedaman26: @KylerNA really? then I must misunderstood what Sloot was talking about then last night.
[0:59:34] BoezIRL: it's that simple
[0:59:57] Joelyboyy: @wEiRdO_dUdE absolutely but nowhere near makes up the gap
[0:59:59] Aervyper: @Towelliee but honestly it's not just the 20man raid team it's the 200+ supporting players that are top tier funnelling into them
[1:00:04] LoseAlotLuke: would sloot move to liquid IF the oppturnity presented itself @Towelliee
[1:00:06] DallTV_: fragnance switched to method from echo ehhe
[1:00:08] mavericks312: apparently liquid may need a tank after yesterday
[1:00:11] Rudric_Ice: Method will take this EZ
[1:00:22] KylerNA: @Davedaman26 sloot is in BDGG. I thought you were talking about method
[1:00:25] ThePawPaw: i still dont get why Frag switch from RANK 1 guild to rank 5-10 or so
[1:00:37] Kapers_: Echo and Liquid breathe, eat and sleep wow during the race, most other guilds don't
[1:00:50] Noshpan: I would love to see Strawberry Puppy Dog Kisses one day make world first
[1:01:13] LeXieSterling: It would be smart and more cost effective. For sure
[1:01:14] PigPenLen: @Aervyper That is the key
[1:01:24] mavericks312: Benw was super pissed after they cleared yesterday
[1:01:28] Aervyper: @Towelliee would be a huge amount of money saved for same profit

[1:01:30] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee any update on your boomer blast flavor with adv?
[1:01:38] Joelyboyy: aura slave NODDERS
[1:01:50] Lulaboo: Ahh
[1:02:02] mavericks312: @lulaboo max was saying it looked like benw was done raiding after the mishap by blizz
[1:02:09] Kinghorn: the big question is how are they going to nerf the boss so it is killable by more than the top 10 guilds in the world
[1:02:15] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Why do Koi only travel in groups of 4?
[1:02:16] Aervyper: @Towelliee how can you have fun playing a prot pally? your literally screwing over the other 19 in the raid
[1:02:23] Noshpan: Good morning @Lulaboo
[1:02:25] Holysal: warrior does dmg takes less dmg and has rally
[1:02:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bloodhunt orange is good, but yeah we still need Boomer Blast
[1:02:53] Rudric_Ice: liquid disband incoming if they lose the next race

[1:02:54] Noshpan: I will be on Boomer Blast like a fat kid on a German chocolate cake
[1:03:08] Kinghorn: that is not going to stop people from getting blown off the platform
[1:03:19] Kinghorn: no buff will help with that
[1:03:22] infektyd: so like ICC in the end season of it
[1:03:24] Davedaman26: Now here is my question now that it's clear that Blizz screwed up with the nerf, but would that mean that their is going to be some big changes to RWF. Kinda like what we were talking about yesterday where Blizz makes an event server for the RWF? Could that happen in the future.
[1:04:08] CloudPants8081: cooksuXEZ_HF fun detected

[1:04:27] Gillettefuzionz: @Davedaman26 the whole point of the RWF is to not be on a tournament realm??
[1:04:27] SteveEH: both guilds are insanely good. blizz just nerfs bosses too fast imo
[1:04:31] Keyastaron_: Merry Christmas Eve everyone
[1:04:37] Kinghorn: I guess with more dps they wont get that far
[1:04:39] dozilla: yeah they did
[1:04:49] shiftfazed: nbo they didnt
[1:05:07] bladdes_00: toxicity in any competitive sports... see football for example... so much hate between fans
[1:05:09] Jarwerewolf: Jarwerewolf gifted a Tier 1 sub to dozilla! 
[1:05:14] Kinghorn: I am pointing fingewrs at SANTA
[1:05:15] honkblarg: i even saw an echo fan getting shit thrown at him for also saying the nerf timing was shit
[1:05:26] quakegoogl: PopCorn PartyHat
[1:05:33] Davedaman26: But what if they did make it a tournament realm, how would that look like.
[1:05:33] Syllvn: They should have just left her unbuffed and go down like Xavius
[1:05:45] shiftfazed: blizzard could care less about that race theyre not invovled with it
[1:05:45] Kratosjr1: Alright everyone I will be back time to go get Breakfast Tacos from the best tasting place in America
[1:05:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard could have a set time for nerfs, so that teams know when they drop
[1:05:52] Kratosjr1: San Antonio
[1:05:58] pocketdimension: @Towelliee what that the nerf came just in time for a half day on christmas eve eve
[1:06:06] valrash1981: I could care less about those guilds or the races, I think it ruins the game if they are catered too.

[1:06:15] Signa_arize: is it +10's that drop that primal focus?
[1:06:20] SinicalDev: @wEiRdO_dUdE They're on complete opposite schedules, it would never work.
[1:06:33] Signa_arize: ohhhh'
[1:06:58] LoseAlotLuke: people are gonna be decked out in crafted gear soon
[1:07:19] Gillettefuzionz: @wEiRdO_dUdE they gave all the guilds a 2 hour heads up a nerf was coming in. Unfortunately Liquid were asleep still
[1:07:51] ThePawPaw: LUL
[1:07:59] kiroslays: Echo deserves it

[1:08:21] MayroVision: Later gang, off to tailgate the Lions game! See me on Tv lower bowl, Row 13. Only fool with a lions jersey on in Charlotte!
[1:08:23] Gillettefuzionz: Echo played out of their minds. Nerf or not they were taking the kill
[1:08:29] Davedaman26: @Gillettefuzionz I will agree with that, but I'm just curious to see what it would look like every RWF team will be on the same playing field start and stop at the same time. I'm just curious. lol

[1:08:53] Joelyboyy: when he heard about the announcement max changed everyones alarm clocks NODDERS
[1:08:59] SinicalDev: Liquid still took nearly 4 hours to kill it post nerf - Echo won fair and square.
[1:09:00] eyemyor: Same time, playing field ... I think it ends up in the same order.
[1:09:08] myamoray: I appreciate when everyone has multiple routes to better gear, especially with crafted gear

[1:13:03] LordGumper: Merry Christmas Towellieeclause
[1:13:03] dozilla: EU people get very sensitive about their echo
[1:13:04] Gillettefuzionz: @Solarwings rewind needs looking at, not evoker altogether. But realistically the other healers need help, I'm not sure nerfing evoker is the play
[1:13:05] SinicalDev: The alternative is to wait and nerf it again when Echo goes to sleep - there's no good solution
[1:13:20] stallowned: a little heads up would have been nice for sure
[1:13:27] mozavich: To be fair, <Ascent> was mostly NA. ;) We did have some players from Finland/Denmark though

[1:13:32] SinicalDev: If you waited for Liquid to be awake, then Echo would be 12 hours deep into their day
[1:13:36] shiftfazed: didint echo get it to 8% before nerf?
[1:13:51] NateWGames: should just be scheduled and blue post
[1:13:55] CloudPants8081: cooksuXEZ_HF blame it on santa
[1:14:04] Jarwerewolf: lol
[1:14:10] dozilla: yeah, they were neck and neck , liquid was 14% and echo was 8% prior to nerf

[1:16:16] TheJus10Bean: what Addon notes the hosts iO score in the group finder?
[1:16:19] Gillettefuzionz: nerf or not, Echo were killing it first - they were insane
[1:16:19] Frostfury: Just git gud as we all say :)
[1:16:30] Lynasz: i think Echo would have won anyway. They were nowhere near end of raid btw, blizzard made an error with that nerf. We need global release man, it would be so exciting to watch as a viewer. players also want it. make it happen blizz!
[1:16:32] westelan_: if they locked out the raid until after xmas, blizz wouldn't have felt they were being backed into a corner and needing to nerf. wasnt well executed by blizz
[1:16:35] Nasilvera: yea it's not like they would have said nerf lets pull one more time then go to bed
[1:16:39] CloudPants8081: how did china do towChad
[1:17:11] Cabbageman007: Do you Anticipate big Roster Changes in <Liquid>?
[1:17:16] Daddy__Winston: nerf should happen when both are activly pulling
[1:17:20] infektyd: few china guilds 7/8
[1:17:35] Metket: echo won when they killed 6th and 7th boss in 1  day same as rygalon and dreads in sepulcher. so far ahead
[1:17:44] CloudPants8081: oh nice
[1:17:49] thasthebear: Dev team didnt want to work on friday let alone past noon
[1:17:51] dozilla: would have been a lot more exciting as a viewer if both guilds were pulling and then the nerf happened, i think that's all people are saying
[1:17:56] LeXieSterling: There is no professional game that insider information is allowed. Blizzard needs to stay out of the world first.
[1:17:59] Kleva1: It is crazy how much they slowed down that storm
[1:18:00] idenkaz_: i mean liquid could have pulled. its not like it was in the middle of the night KEKW
[1:18:02] SteveEH: Isn't there blizzard staff at the live events too? lol.. They used to be there in the past
[1:18:03] Nauticca: Nauticca subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 68 months! Merry Christmas Eve
[1:18:07] Gillettefuzionz: @Daddy__Winston when the nerf came in, it was about 8 am for Liquid. They could have been up and pulling. There is never going to be a right time to make a change
[1:18:22] KralYoshii: @Towelliee hows t he wheather where u are.. its 39 degrees in florida
[1:18:24] Nasilvera: best idea hold mythic till after Christmas
[1:18:28] Semtex9000: Even after nerf they still were well put together. i think echo had it no matter what
[1:18:30] Aidler: max was very brave and calm on his stream yesterday
[1:18:33] mavericks312: @steveeh RWF isn't a blizz event though
[1:18:57] Kapers_: @Towelliee Do you like all difficulties released same week? Or mythic one week later
[1:18:57] Gillettefuzionz: @SteveEH blizz staff have never been at the events??
[1:19:01] dozilla: @Jarwerewolf hey thanks for the gifted sub :)
[1:19:05] Daddy__Winston: @Daddy__Winston @Gillettefuzionz  could have been up....
[1:19:14] bladdes_00: echo changed their specs for the last phase .. at the last day.. was more prepared for the kill
[1:19:18] Coldv2: Whats that addon your using to see ratings and classes

[1:19:59] Gillettefuzionz: @Daddy__Winston they were given a 2hour warning from the devs? It's their choice to stay in bed and get a good amount rest
[1:19:59] tigo3: feck it
[1:20:01] sycnessx: algethar is bugged rn , careful :D
[1:20:07] CloudPants8081: cooksuXEZ_HF
[1:20:07] SteveEH: @mavericks312 i know that but they're there to relay information pre covid lol.
[1:20:16] bladdes_00: they one shotted coz they optimized for that.. they knew 3rd phase was so easy compare to 1st or 2nd..
[1:20:18] dpbdagger: what do you think about the overall viewcount being so low, especially having drops? just time of the year?
[1:20:21] Affiiance: Max DGAF... he just going to go stream and collect his cash

[1:21:04] tigo3: lol

[1:21:50] idenkaz_: i hope one day Max i able to go independend and make his own org. like Echo basically
[1:22:06] ty_ston96: so what happened with the WFR? echo won because a nerf or something or they nerfed while one team was sleeping? and won because of that?
[1:22:07] bigstick258: you seen golden state this year?
[1:22:14] mavericks312: I think liquid could use more dps who are aware of mechanics cause that was a big issue is dying early in fights
[1:22:37] lindakri: Echo had more entertaining casters
[1:22:43] lil_alakazam: liquid fan sadge but true

[1:22:50] naznarens: Casters make the difference too imo
[1:22:50] Affiiance: I mean if the players arent good enough... what do you change?
[1:22:55] Keejammin: Echo had the better broadcast
[1:22:58] bladdes_00: that was also coz liquid's production was poor compare to echo's
[1:23:02] lil_alakazam: yeah echo was really entertaining
[1:23:08] pocketdimension: @Towelliee I didn't follow the shadowlands rwf how long has echo had that many 'coaches' on the sidelines
[1:23:08] Affiiance: Echo just has better players
[1:23:09] mozavich: "you have to play to win, you have to win to play" - michael scott
[1:23:22] mavericks312: if you take Jak and naguura off liquids casting they don't have anyone big name wise
[1:23:28] Purgatan: echo and method had better broadcasts and I stayed in liquid's channel to try and support while they were raiding.
[1:23:30] swervity82: Echo's casters were more entertaining as well
[1:23:35] thasthebear: Echos coverage of BDGG was better than BDGGs
[1:23:37] kiroslays: Personally I only ever saw Maximums stream. Idk if Liquid even has there own stream. But I was not interested in watching Maximum
[1:23:39] kashmara: was like 80k yesterday a few hours before the kill
[1:23:43] sidebo20: Towel where can i find that to do list you use ?
[1:23:51] LeXieSterling: Towelliee this is off the subject. Will you be streaming on News Eve?
[1:23:55] draconisraccoonis: I was watching and rooting for BDGG, kinda over Liquid
[1:23:59] Zettabyte: Heyoo towHAMUP

[1:24:05] cabalish: @sidebo20ttv https://wago.io/TamasDragonflightHelper

[1:24:27] HEIZALL: :)
[1:24:30] Kelticlore: how big of an upset you think it of been if a 3rd guild came from behind
[1:24:35] Zettabyte: @Noshpan Good timezone towHAMUP
[1:24:55] Affiiance: He shouldnt... the race literally lasts a couple weeks
[1:24:58] Oldduketree007: Would like EU and US merge ;P the ping nightmare
[1:24:59] mavericks312: towel a future liquid caster lol
[1:25:06] lithium364: how when the chinese servers are down ? kekw
[1:25:10] faulen: china cannot even play wow in a couple months LUL
[1:25:19] ItsXolten: Isn't WoW going away in China?
[1:25:24] bladdes_00: they can do it like MDI or Arena Tournament
[1:25:33] ty_ston96: China strat = bodies to the wall and if that fails more bodies to the wall
[1:25:36] mavericks312: @itsxolten yes and no
[1:25:37] Kelticlore: @lithium364 not till January i think
[1:25:44] Kinghorn: chain pulling and chain smoking
[1:25:48] Affiiance: I wish Blizzard would watch my Heroic Raid and come nerf the boss when we dont have enough damage to kill it LUL

[1:25:54] CloudPants8081: atpCap

[1:26:55] reggiepowa: @Affiiance how and when are they catering to those guilds?
[1:26:58] mavericks312: when's the last time thd wasn't in a raid group
[1:27:01] bladdes_00: fragnance left echo recently
[1:27:09] Holysal: @AtmosFear26 splatt had better gear
[1:27:10] Kinghorn: 4 ilvl AtmosFear26
[1:27:14] slimoby: and that's okay
[1:27:15] Affiiance: They literally nerfed the boss instead of making them gear up to kill it
[1:27:17] naznarens: Well Echo bench played M+ until the last minute, every day for 15 hours in case they get brought on
[1:27:23] MindGames_187: ahhhhh ok

[1:28:05] Nebulizer87: that boss seems purposely tuned to be unkillable
[1:28:09] mozavich: @Affiiance this shows how little you know of top end raiding. a 50% nerf to the shield isn't a GEAR issue. it's a tuning issue.
[1:28:11] zysmos: Pretty disappointed the way the handled the end of the race
[1:28:14] SteveEH: @jeangulfran so did liquid lol go look at goop/sang/mark etc
[1:28:25] Kinghorn: they buffed the boss like 3 times before people even started pulls on him didnt they
[1:28:34] valrash1981: How about not pay attention to those guilds at all.
[1:28:40] KylerNA: They will probably have to bring back end boss testing at this rate.  IT's probably nice for the ugilds as a surprise thing, but holy moly the nerfs they've been having to do on the bosses is crazy
[1:28:52] Affiiance: @mozavich oh are you a ttop end raider?
[1:28:58] jure__: Gingi said he would've liked to kill the boss without the nerf, that it would be very satisfying, but with the holidays he's ok with the nerf.
[1:29:06] Nebulizer87: it should have been a 1 week tier imo
[1:29:07] pocketdimension: @valrash1981 then the boss would be unkillable for months
[1:29:15] Frank4LuLz: GOOD MORNING TOWEL, AND FAM
[1:29:18] Nebulizer87: if that boss followed any of the rest of the raid tuning
[1:29:28] jasperboy: jasperboy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 134 months! towBlack
[1:29:35] CloudPants8081: 420 tppowerHeresTommy

[1:29:50] Zettabyte: @jasperboy towPog

[1:30:06] zysmos: People saying "stop catering to these top guilds" it's not a good look when it takes 100 pulls to clear the first 7 bosses and 250+ on the last boss
[1:30:16] Oldduketree007: releasing a expension close to holiday seems a bit evil x'D
[1:30:34] jasperboy: @Zettabyte towLove
[1:30:42] Breakernaut: The timing of the release was just a mess. There was no way Blizzard was going to let the race continue past the holidays. It wouldn't be fair to the raiders and community to just sit there for 2 weeks

[1:31:35] Frank4LuLz: REMEMEBER, ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, PERIOD
[1:31:37] Oldduketree007: @Masqerader I meant more for blizzard emplyees and devs xD

[1:32:34] Frank4LuLz: towCopium
[1:32:54] Kelticlore: blizz could of released dragonflight on 12/13 and release the raids 1/3
[1:32:56] PBRbiter: i despise this dungeon lol
[1:32:56] Aquadriel: How about instead of hoping blizzard does global release you rwf mofos make some rules and make the competition 'fair'.
[1:33:11] Solarwings: court of stars best dungeon

[1:34:05] SwizzNasty: mass dispell up for everyone arcane
[1:34:07] Aquadriel: Breakernaut oh i dont think is unfair now at all, but most people keep saying "global release would fix it" when it wouldnt.
[1:34:23] warrenny: @breakernaut Apparently the nerf favoured echo but that bullshit imo

[4:00:07] Infiniteanchor: @Roenoake wait all a pally needs is artifact transmog on?

[4:04:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Enhancement can do a ton of damage, just depends on if his gear is alright and he's the right spec and doing his rotation well

[4:11:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Hyper X is different now
[4:12:04] Shaele: how do you not know of that? it's like a year old news
[4:12:06] Frankthemindsculptor: with liquid being NA and echo being EU, was there a time for blizzard to nerf last boss and not screw one of the guilds?
[4:12:25] Provision_: @Crypticedge what should of happened? Not much happened. Nerf was announced, Liquid was sleeping and missed it. Echo killed it.
[4:12:40] 3dRes: Wow, that's amazing
[4:12:41] jkitchin75: @Frankthemindsculptor no
[4:12:44] rosina_scarlett: https://twitter.com/Gingitv/status/1606696610364542976 Blizzard does need to do this. I'm sure Liquid/Echo would coordinate to be on the same raid times

[4:13:00] TheGinjahNinja: wait is origin a corshair company?

[4:13:30] Demonic_Banshee5: had it for 3 years
[4:13:39] zysmos: my hyperx cloud 2 still going strong
[4:13:42] odtee: I used the corsair k65 for 7 years, just replaced with a razer huntsman
[4:13:52] bootyINSANOFLEX: I've been rocking my Sennheiser for years. Best  headset i've ever had
[4:13:58] Provision_: @Crypticedge well they never going to get 8% out of nowhere. prob need another reset without the nerf. But Liquid has not killed it yet anyway
[4:14:02] tocu: Werent you like the first Origin sponsored PC built on stream for them a century ago ?
[4:14:04] bootyINSANOFLEX: I think i've had it for almost 10 years
[4:14:06] canniik: Was thinking about all the fallout from the nerf. It did play into Echos hands a bit but it was completely out of there control. The only folk responsible for it are Blizzard unfortunately.
[4:14:12] Denohar: I loved my beyer but the sennheisers just fit my head better
[4:14:16] canniik: *their
[4:14:16] TheEmperor30k: @Towelliee do you have a link?
[4:14:21] floatinging: Sennheiser makes the most comfortable stuff

[4:14:41] faulen: in terms of quiality
[4:14:42] loulegoz: those were fun to watch
[4:14:45] Galadeon: Bose makes a really good wireless noise canceling headset.

[4:15:36] cinnamints: @Provision_ The noteworthy thing I think "were sleeping" may not fully convey is that they were keeping their established schedule. Blizz put a change in when the Guild who was in the lead for the vast majority of the race was not ever planning to be at their facility.

[4:25:46] Gezber: family HYPERS
[4:25:47] Coriollis: they taking off for hollidays
[4:25:51] razeriel123: warrior 100% hp all the time in 17 and my prot pall at 12 looks like wet noodle lol
[4:25:54] kassafras: they all had to leave today, unless their flights were canceled/delayed. max said he was going to be able to host about 5-6 people if needed due to weather.
[4:25:58] Shirey36: is there alot of controversy over the nerf while limit was sleeping or has it not been  much of an issue
[4:25:58] Alacod: RL>WoW
[4:26:07] odtee: yeah could have done the nerf a day early imo
[4:26:08] mmo_kenna_: Liquid had the L not Blizzard
[4:26:11] EnragedSushi: A big "L" sure.  But even with the "nerf" Liquid was pullin WAY more than Echo.   Lets calm down.

[4:26:42] metavahn231: what if this was a 17 academy would you even try
[4:26:48] Groltank: tbh its concerning and not fair and liquid always pulls more b/c echo takes 2 hours breaks between pulls...lol however the ending it for christmas is understandable
[4:26:55] vitusvoid: @akia03 LULW
[4:26:55] Jarlan23: yeah liquid had time to wake up. no ones fault but theyre own that they stayed up so late. they werent gonna prog 17% or w/e it was that night
[4:27:04] tn_lukeduke: i thought you was a pally Towelee..?
[4:27:13] metavahn231: na are just light weights
[4:27:13] Coriollis: the wole world first situation sux, evan Scripe said it on stream right after, but I can't blame Blizzard for wanting to have a Xmas instead of RWF
[4:27:15] regicidall1: Echo played twice as much as liquid though, no sleep.
[4:27:34] Jarlan23: and obviosuly i know this because im a very experience world first raider not a captain hindsight
[4:27:36] Alacod: @elixirfield1 nice bait
[4:27:39] budly: 94.5% to go up

[4:28:40] metavahn231: liquids mythic prog was them joking about chromi, and playing 3x less than echo did
[4:29:17] metavahn231: so why would blizz even give them a "fair" chance lol
[4:29:18] Sevcikova: Dungeon should be closed, make the nerf, all teams have 2 hours to prepare, first kill wins.. thats how it should be done.
[4:29:26] firewalltwitch: its a sign of bad things to come @towelliee u cant deny it
[4:29:29] mmo_kenna_: No flame on Blizzard, Liquid in bedge for some reason lmao

[4:29:31] kassafras: blizzard does not care about the rwf though.
[4:29:45] Admiller0: the simplest answer is to tune better
[4:29:47] konoko8: tbh echo killed it with the nerf on the first pull liquid took another few hours.
[4:29:49] Nathanonfire: its not on them to cater for the RWF its not a blizz event they need to make it a blizz event then it will be fair across the board
[4:29:53] ghostfacez2: THIS EXPANSION OVERALL IS NOT THAT GOOD SO FAR
[4:29:54] Hesh3: Why does the race have to finish within 1-2 weeks? its the hardest content int he game
[4:29:58] Admiller0: the more difficult is like "the timing of tuning" etc
[4:30:03] Alacod: Are people actually going full doomer over a badly timed nerf?
[4:30:11] odtee: I think dragonflight numbers are a cause for celebration for blizz for sure
[4:30:11] metavahn231: the crafting is fking awesome so is dragonflying
[4:30:18] Joeemercy: legion ftw
[4:30:18] Coriollis: @kassafras they care, thats why they have team fixing stuff on stand by in teamspeak
[4:30:18] Asuo_: They also clearly wanted the boss dead before christmas and slammed nerfs faster as the holiday approached
[4:30:20] firewalltwitch: this is a great expansion for a wow player, nothing special if u arent
[4:30:23] metavahn231: raid is just kidna meh
[4:30:23] Orthobullet: this, wrath, and legion
[4:30:24] Holysal: @ghostfacez2 what is so bad about it?
[4:30:25] ShowDUH: @kassafras them why do they have a discord channel with RWF guild to talk with them and buff/nerf stuff accordingly
[4:30:29] metavahn231: but m+ is good
[4:30:29] Syllvn: @ghostfacez2 Thanks for your opinion xD
[4:30:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Their internal testing definitely needs work. I get one-shotted by freaking hunt bosses
[4:30:31] twistedstick1: They where prob getting to the end of the work day and wanted to start the holiday weekend.
[4:30:32] superpudd: Its so good though, M+ is a bit over tuned, but that'll solve itself with gear and some nerfs
[4:30:35] Provision_: @ghostfacez2 how it not that great? Seem like that now how the community see it
[4:30:42] konoko8: Was is ur top 3 rn @Towelliee for expansions?
[4:30:46] canniik: I guess its hard to test something when the best players don't work for you too.
[4:30:48] Orthobullet: legion and pandaria also great
[4:30:48] Exodeo_: I'm loving the expansion so far myself, it's a personal opinion after all
[4:30:50] fakevaltteri: I love this expansion. Plenty to do, but not so much it feels like I have to play all day every day. The road map is really promising too.
[4:30:53] Jarlan23: man i loved wrath but it had more to do with everything being exciting and new and the people i played it with
[4:31:01] mmo_kenna_: Liquid started 10am and both guilds got 2 hour notice of nerf? Also it took 3 hours for Liquid to kill after. Echo had a god pull
[4:31:04] koldar_nemesis: DF is the best exp since pandaria
[4:31:07] c0mmander_starscream: Merry XMAS
[4:31:08] ColdChillXI: saying the expasion is not good without examples LUL
[4:31:11] cinnamints: @elixirfield1 Liquid didn't play less. Players who weren't in a raid comp were running keys, so people who weren't watching multiple streams didn't realize they were gearing alts throughout.
[4:31:32] Sonatta: @canniik here's a better idea... Blizzard just doesn't release a Mythic Raid until Blizzard can clear the content themselves :P
[4:31:36] Grunton: making a raid to be beatin a week after release is weird
[4:31:37] KonceptionZ: lol whaaaaaaaaaat
[4:31:40] Affiiance: Yep its stupid
[4:31:43] Breakernaut: Liquid had more pulls
[4:31:50] TialePetit: @ColdChillXI RIIIGHT! LOL
[4:32:00] Coriollis: glabal release Blizzard plox , global release :)
[4:32:03] mmo_kenna_: ATHENE streaming WoW? Must be Xmas
[4:32:11] konoko8: @Breakernaut so?
[4:32:11] Breakernaut: @Sonatta just cause you design the game doesn't mean you can play the game
[4:32:16] valianya: Boss because he's part of boss fight if you don't kill separately
[4:32:20] odtee: echo deserved it just because of 2 weeks of 4:30am wakeups and liquid couldnt be bothered to start before 11am on the last day
[4:32:26] Lindenir: Tupac?
[4:32:32] Provision_: @ColdChillXI hard to give example if you dont play it LUL
[4:32:33] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:32:40] Affiiance: Honestly I wish Blizzard would come in and nerf Heroic when my guild didnt have the damage to kill a boss... must be nice
[4:32:50] canniik: @Sonatta Yeah maybe so, although I'd expect that their staff will have tested it and succeeded in doing so but with absolutely maxed gear. They'll have given themselves the best gear to do so.
[4:32:55] ColdChillXI: @Provision_ LUL
[4:33:23] H3roForHire: well when they nerf just say it ahead of time
[4:33:23] metavahn231: blizz cant babysit the teams and wait for them to play the game LUL
[4:33:24] mozavich: @Affiiance you don't understand how tuning works, do ya?
[4:33:25] kenneticzz: blizzard world first their own race
[4:33:28] MikeyGonzoTV: hey does anyone know what the addon is called that gives your mouse pointer a circle??
[4:33:29] Provision_: @Affiiance well they can only notice problems once people do the content. If the best guilds can't get passed a stage it prob safe to say it overtuned
[4:33:29] faulen: Boss changes should be at a set time everyday.
[4:33:29] EnragedSushi: Who says ECHO knew?  Are we saying Blizzard  told ECHO without telling Liquid?  Stop.
[4:33:31] VaughanVenture: The idea that a company like Blizzard would wait and plan around the scheduled of 20 players is absolutely insane.
[4:33:32] kassafras: they did announce it 2 hours ahead of time, but liquid was sleeping so they hadn't gotten the message.
[4:33:34] visaeris412: holly pretty much said they want to follow the legion release schedule. i think we can all agree legion was one of the best wow expansions. also thoughts on artifact weapons? kinda want them to come back. nothing worse than hoping and praying for a weapon
[4:33:37] EnragedSushi: ECHO was awake.  Liquid wasn't.  Stop dude
[4:33:39] Sonatta: i saw that post LUL
[4:33:45] Sudocomm: They should have closed the raid, and told all of the guilds in the race that the nerf was happening this date this time and be ready.
[4:33:45] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal during the WoW:Dragonflight marathons. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[4:33:46] c0mmander_starscream: "Max Knew" towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil
[4:33:46] TialePetit: Cause Blizz didn't suddenly decide that moment to nerf it.. it was at least 24hrs planned, Blizz could have sent the info out when all teams were awake.
[4:33:52] Bennodkk: they have beeen doing plenty of tuning too while echo has been sleeping
[4:33:59] MajurDJ: I'm not sure if you heard Ian's response in that discord, but he made a good point. If they waited much longer then Echo would have been winding down for the day and the same drama could have happened in favor of Liquid instead of Echo
[4:34:00] comp1: its alot of that on twitter
[4:34:04] dolletino: Knew about what?
[4:34:05] Sonatta: @EnragedSushi echo was in a discord with blizzard
[4:34:10] Davedaman26: What's done is done can't change the outcome
[4:34:10] readswords: ive been away? so they nerfed the boss during the race? wow thats crazy lol
[4:34:10] Galadeon: hears out of context, towell said Max knew about the nerf but stayed in bed.
[4:34:19] Affiiance: @mozavich I remember you being silent when I asked if you were a top end raider earlier... move on dont be butt hurt
[4:34:20] Coriollis: I mean is not like Echo didn't get cucked by Blizzard hotfixing stuff while asleep on other bosses or other tiers
[4:34:23] Provision_: @EnragedSushi both were informed, Liquid was asleep so they did not get the information in time
[4:34:24] Irhamel: @Towelliee I developed a skill over time, that allows me to read the blaberbs of braindead fools like that nd just go over it as if I didnt read a thing.
[4:34:27] canniik: If that's the case also I feel like Liquid could have had someone awake to monitor any Blizzard news in case of announcements just like this.
[4:34:31] Admiller0: @yeahhboyd yea while liquid was asleep LUL
[4:34:32] MajurDJ: There was no good time to push that nerf
[4:34:33] ShowDUH: @Towelliee if you want a good laugh, FTbubbler went ham again on Liquid, he's still salty as fuck
[4:34:38] Breakernaut: I like all the armchair raiders critiquing how Liquid handled their raid schedule...where are you all standing in the world first races?
[4:34:41] faulen: If there is going to be Boss changes it should be at a set time everyday.
[4:34:46] TialePetit: @MajurDJ Knowing a nerf was coming once Liquid started, they would have stayed up.
[4:34:52] idenkaz_: people say this and that in the end its a Blizz fuk up. they should have known better
[4:34:55] canniik: Worth remembering that it still took liquid a few attempts to kill the boss after the nerf too.
[4:34:56] Affiiance: FTbubbler lost his damn mind yesterday LMAO
[4:34:57] odtee: method still doing prog on christmas?
[4:34:58] Stinnkey: @Showduh FTbubbler is such a joke
[4:34:58] cinnamints: Yep, Liquid was on their normal schedule. They weren't sleeping in. They'd had a great night of prog & hadn't gone late b/c they believed the boss was killable the next day without nerfs. The nerf went in when they were resting to continue to race.
[4:35:00] metavahn231: rwf isent even a official event why would blizz pannder to liquid
[4:35:04] AvrithSATX: The fault is on the race coordinators that had the teams competing at different times.
[4:35:05] kassafras: echo was going to get the win on that boss regardless. the problem is, now that it has been nerfed nobody will give echo the credit that they deserved to win.
[4:35:09] readswords: @yeahhboyd id be salty too tbh thats crazy lol
[4:35:26] Provision_: Liquid prob would go sleep earlier if they knew 10am a nerf was coming
[4:35:32] wisperuna: Legion artifact OP
[4:35:33] Keyastaron_: detect demons and DH sight works?
[4:35:34] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:35:34] VaughanVenture: Blizzard doesn't owe shit to Echo or Liquid though, and that's the right move. Catering to RWF (40 players out of millions of playerbase) makes no sense. Real people working at Blizz want to spend time with families and get out of the office for the holidays.
[4:35:34] MajurDJ: @MajurDJ no one knew the nerf was coming until it happened so this is irrelevant
[4:35:35] Coriollis: Echo were the ones to break the shield on un nerfed Razs too while Liquid were still struggling depite 100 pulls more
[4:35:36] Sonatta: Illusion! What are you hiding?
[4:35:37] wafflerboss: FTBubbler is a racist homophobe that got perma benched and is salty about it
[4:35:38] TialePetit: @kassafras People have given them credit, due to the fact overall they were the better team.
[4:35:38] Holysal: @AvrithSATX both teams played on their reset times
[4:35:45] daxirr1: What about the two other nerfs that happened on the same boss as Echo went to sleep?
[4:35:47] Sluggs_: @elixirfield1 not an official event yet they tweet it and make nerfs based on it so a kill would happen before christmas
[4:35:50] chehf: got redzone and towelliee going

[4:36:13] faulen: If there is going to be Boss changes it should be at a set time everyday.
[4:36:22] Jarlan23: blizzard knows when youre sleeping monkaS knows when ur awake monkaS
[4:36:26] dolletino: What was the nerf?
[4:36:26] Coriollis: scripe is just honest
[4:36:32] mmo_kenna_: Ever heard the expression snooze you lose?
[4:36:48] readswords: they should have just kept it as is, was kinda fun watching them try to take em down
[4:36:50] kassafras: @kassafras SOME people have given them credit. there are a lot of people not though.
[4:36:52] c0mmander_starscream: Way too much insider information
[4:36:55] Provision_: @Jarlan23 well Liquid has a whole stream showing when they racing and sleeping. Easy for blizzard to know
[4:36:58] TialePetit: @Towelliee Blizz would have had this nerf planned the day before at the least, and that gives plenty of time for Blizz to reach out to the teams and say "Dec 23, we will be placing an adjustment on Raz" Giving all teams notice and then they can choose to be prepared on time or not.
[4:37:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[4:37:00] Lupusdeus: Were members of Liquid in that discord where it was announced?
[4:37:02] cinnamints: The thing is, they DIDN'T run late. That was their schedule. The nerfs went in when they wrem'
[4:37:11] Galadeon: Old man Boomer does not like new tech, news at ll
[4:37:11] volkreig: Should be global release for the raid honestly
[4:37:11] cinnamints: *weren't ever going to be raiding
[4:37:12] kineticdh: what discord is this
[4:37:14] VaughanVenture: They didn't lose cause they snoozed. They lost because they played worse. Come on.
[4:37:18] Davedaman26: Well he's not wrong lol
[4:37:18] Valearleen: i love when NA wins EU says gg but whne EU wins all you ear is excuses LUL
[4:37:18] EnragedSushi: Imma be honest.  You go to bed sub 10% in the middle of a heated RWF then you chance losing out.  PERIOD>
[4:37:19] firewalltwitch: so why didnt blizzard nerf the boss well echo was asleep the day b4? Kappa
[4:37:20] Admiller0: so theyre supposed to never sleep - what a great take LUL
[4:37:22] Deanz_: the fact that they were at a disadvantage because they need to sleep as humans is wild
[4:37:25] logic_fl: Think they will start testing last boss again?
[4:37:28] Vimelo: they should stop giving information that only affect 100 people at this point in raid maybe that fix it
[4:37:29] Vargful: If you can't play for 18 hours and sleep for 6, you don't deserve it anyways. these kind of events happening like 3 times in 2 years and if you can't sacrifice some sleep, if you can't get up mentally and physically. You don't deserve it. On top of that, statistically well deserved World First.
[4:37:32] BlackAngelxD: BlackAngelxD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[4:37:32] idenkaz_: people are railed up a bit. dude has a point
[4:37:39] Alsparq: in the end this is a promotional event for the teams and for blizz so it needs to be handled accordingly
[4:37:41] ShockASU: What's the addon on the right side under the map that shows the key?
[4:37:41] KonceptionZ: ITS A RACE
[4:37:42] roflpotamus: stand in mid dont move!!
[4:37:48] mmo_kenna_: They were still up trying to catch up to Echo too late
[4:37:49] daconcion: Echo played out of their minds on Rasz, idk if Liiquid would have beaten them anyways
[4:37:50] Dcarter: Idiotic statement if you snooze you lose like come on
[4:37:55] Provision_: @Vallanaar You think NA and EU react different? LUL
[4:38:01] Thralazaar: it would be cool to see both echo and liquid raiding in the same building, like pool together and rent out a massive venue for a combined event with the echo casters
[4:38:02] Dcarter: You don’t deserve it if you sleep???????
[4:38:04] roflpotamus: Lets go bengals WHO DEY
[4:38:04] Sevcikova: progression should have stopped, 2 hour window for them to nerf, all on deck after 2 hour break, and first kill wins.. thats the right way to do it.
[4:38:05] Teriyakibro: KEKW
[4:38:07] Gezber: LUL
[4:38:07] Rictamar: meh Liquid had 100 more pulls and took nearly 2 more hours after the nerf to kill, deserved win by Echo
[4:38:07] GTmask: LUL
[4:38:09] metavahn231: cant really just ask a billion dollar corporation to sit around and wait for a team to wake up, especially when its not even a official event LUL
[4:38:15] firewalltwitch: this boss to op
[4:38:16] Teriyakibro: its opposite day pepeD
[4:38:21] Exodeo_: so about that frontal
[4:38:22] Kratosjr1: Borracho Beans are cooking
[4:38:23] Breakernaut: Echo was a head before the nerf though. Both teams are playing at a level that 99% of this stream will never play at.
[4:38:38] wisperuna: is it not counted towards the CR ?
[4:38:38] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[4:38:40] Keyastaron_: already used? LUL
[4:38:41] Coriollis: need reagent to ank LUL
[4:38:42] kripuzin: imagine the 50% shield nerf and the 5% HP would have been enough to kill the boss, which btw went live 3am CET with echo slepping....
[4:38:47] Provision_: @Dcarter yeah sleep is part of the race. I just find it weird with how big Liquid is they had no person monitoring it
[4:38:48] firewalltwitch: i dont think u guys get it
[4:38:53] Dcarter: Ahead doesn’t mean kill pull count matters not I mean echo won that’s that but these takes on what matters is ridiculous
[4:38:56] Rictamar: Echo ALSO spent a day and half more no splits and STILL was ahead before the nerf
[4:38:58] daconcion: The nerf went out right before the end of their last day of work before the holidays, that probably played a larger role in the nerf timing than anything else
[4:39:02] turbodai: everyone was saaying the boss was going to be nerfed cause of the holidays what i cant understand is why liquid wasnt ready for it its on liquid not blizzard
[4:39:03] ShockASU: @Towelliee What's the addon that shows the key info on the right side under the map?
[4:39:03] Rictamar: Liquid were second best, simple
[4:39:04] koldar_nemesis: last boss is brutal
[4:39:08] Davedaman26: Ok topic change hows the weather outside? It sucks here I'm at got to love lake effect snow.
[4:39:09] Rictamar: on*
[4:39:12] ricesoup: blizz basically decides who wins or loses at this point LUL
[4:39:16] TialePetit: @Gylduran Yup.. Liquid didn't have the DPS regardless.  It would have been completely different if Liquid downed Raz on the first shot after the nerf. But they didn't, that shows they weren't where they needed to be regardless.
[4:39:20] aimassistallen: This is a horrible fight
[4:39:25] Jarlan23: i cant see those fucking line things really
[4:39:29] Jarlan23: the foggy lil lines
[4:39:39] Krait06: too much shit going on from player abilities
[4:39:47] TialePetit: @ricesoup Nope.. Liquid didn't have the DPS needed to down it fast enough.
[4:39:47] Rictamar: @Dcarter pull count matters, yet liquid had 100 more pulls LUL
[4:39:53] hadusii: If you have effects turned down the coulds disappear too lol
[4:39:57] GothmaN: i hate this boss it makes me think i'm blind
[4:40:06] erageK: waht happened i really dont get it?liquid had 8 hours before echo to even start raiding this tier.Liquid was from the beginning behind echo in razsa literally echo went 19% WAY before liquid did and knew what the last phase was like
[4:40:32] koldar_nemesis: 24M health dam
[4:40:37] Provision_: @TialePetit no way to tell, after Echo kill i bet Liquid did not push as much as they would if they were still racing. Since it was a given they going to be 2nd
[4:40:43] erageK: echo was 3 hours in when the hotfix went online
[4:40:49] DiranJei: yo
[4:40:52] Breakernaut: @Dcarter echo was ahead % wise before the nerf happened.
[4:41:01] indigooo: eragek, the boss was nerfed just before the last pull@echo's
[4:41:02] Rictamar: I don't get the Liquid lost unfairly take, makes no sense, they were behind on Razageth nearly the whole boss. Echo took a day and a half longer to do splits and still surpasses them in percentage and pull count
[4:41:05] Dcarter: Not the point but it’s fine just think as you do
[4:41:07] erageK: and it was uploaded as a hotfix not a nerf
[4:41:10] indigooo: they just made it killable
[4:41:12] Dcarter: It gonna argue there’s zero point

[4:41:54] Provision_: @Gylduran Echo looked at Liquid progression to learn mechanics etc. make it easier to progress tho
[4:42:00] Rictamar: well when people make terrible arguments that Liquid lost unfairly it deserves to be called out. Echo were simply better end of story
[4:42:04] realsyphix: those ground effects really are almost invisible depending on graphic settings
[4:42:09] Jarlan23: *puts on some eminem*
[4:42:15] erageK: not even worth arguing echo would have killed the boss that day before liquid fixed or not
[4:42:18] Admiller0: @Provision_ truth
[4:42:22] dolletino: What was the nerf?
[4:42:24] Deanz_: it will stack the adds tho
[4:42:24] koldar_nemesis: @realsyphix agree 100%
[4:42:25] itz_blinktv: "we can +2 this" feels bad man
[4:42:26] erageK: and again its a "nerf" by being fixed
[4:42:27] Deanz_: open the room up
[4:42:36] Coriollis: @Provision_ u do realise Echo was ahead of Liquid in prog for the whole Razs fight right ?
[4:42:45] Rictamar: @Provision_ still, they were well behind, caught up, and played better. After the nerf, Liquid took much longer to kill. Echo killed it in 1 pull lol
[4:42:49] Keyastaron_: what do you get for 16s  ? something for professions?
[4:43:05] Deanz_: its a necessary evil to negate some outgoing dmg at this point
[4:43:06] GreenbudzTFC: :o
[4:43:08] Provision_: @Coriollis only that fight, he was talking about liquid having more time etc.
[4:43:12] VaughanVenture: @Provision_ You got it backwards. Max said he would watch Echo's raids to learn.
[4:43:12] erageK: stop being butthurt about a welldeserved kill
[4:43:22] Gillettefuzionz: @Provision_ you can't be serious @Provision_ ...
[4:43:43] Rictamar: @vlex14 bingo, but that doesn't fit their narrative LUL
[4:43:50] Meakis: Meakis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 87 months, currently on a 85 month streak! o/ happy Christmas everybody
[4:43:53] Coriollis: @Provision_ the other fight were cleared by Liquid and Echo on reset in 3-4 hours aka they didn't mattered to either of them except Razs
[4:44:00] BlackAngelxD: same person that dies lol
[4:44:00] Deanz_: top down view helps a lot
[4:44:02] Gezber: how do they keep dying Sadge

[4:44:46] Coriollis: its a deplete sir LUL

[4:45:45] Gillettefuzionz: @Admiller0 No, i mean using that as an argument as to why Echo won. Of course anyone in that position is going to do that.
[4:45:54] Jarlan23: can you pop spell reflect and go through one of those things
[4:45:58] Jarlan23: like on xymox

[4:47:15] Jarlan23: are you saying the hour between pulls echo takes to discuess strats works out
[4:47:15] Katalystgb: limit are the kings of Chokahontis gaming
[4:47:17] Rictamar: pull count, percentage before nerf, and time after nerf to kill all in Echo's favour. Liquid second best
[4:47:18] Enlargamus: Hey put some respect on Frank Reich's name sir haha
[4:47:22] Provision_: @Coriollis ofc, it not always positive to have the patch earlier. you also the first testing the fights.
[4:47:23] dolletino: @towelliee what was the nerf everyone is going on about?
[4:47:28] Pharaoh_326: MAx even said they didnt know how good evoker healer was.
[4:47:46] c0mmander_starscream: Bill Belichick vs The Jets coach
[4:47:47] sintax_24: No shade on Max but after these back to back losses he needs to look at his leadership
[4:47:48] Alacod: the proof is in the pudding. they won
[4:47:53] allisonkielle: so it was an rng win
[4:47:54] cabalish: analyse - reorganize kill
[4:48:01] erageK: its a hotfix the with the room
[4:48:14] Katalystgb: @Alacod boomer alert
[4:48:15] Lostdogal: The dream breath move echo pulled out is still the best thing that I saw during the race. Brilliant use of class abilities
[4:48:15] Nathanonfire: @sintax_24 max isnt the problem echos raiders are just better than the over all raiders in liquid alot more clean
[4:48:17] superpudd: get pattched up
[4:48:22] superpudd: from the sand dude
[4:48:24] mmo_kenna_: they ran 11 grief torch trinkets and planned to suicide to reset the cd on everyones trinkets raining fire
[4:48:25] MackPlays: Yeah liquid needs to do some firing after this performance

[4:48:29] Rictamar: @sintax_24 you mean back to back to back losses LUL
[4:48:30] Gillettefuzionz: @sintax_24 It could be players, Echo's roster is just stacked
[4:48:37] Archiee: last win they have was CN
[4:48:38] Coriollis: @Provision_ if u truly belive Liquid got their tactics for the first boss on mythic from whoever random guild killed it first on mythic than I have nothing else to say :)
[4:48:38] Provision_: Echo is very good at finding unique ways to overcome barriers. not just in RWF but also in MDI
[4:48:39] Bennodkk: seeing people wipe to the same shit over and over again and just keep face smahing your head on the keyboard is just as boring as people actually taking their time to talk about what do
[4:48:49] Yagr6: how long will an org support you when u dont win?
[4:49:05] Archiee: Echo is just better at every aspect of raiding. Period
[4:49:08] SeckSymbols: @sintax_24 EU overall has a larger pool to pull from compared to NA, thats why Liquid is having to dip into the EU player pool to fill their roster
[4:49:14] allisonkielle: such as a nerf right before their winning pull that adds up
[4:49:17] Rictamar: Scripe said it was technically possible to kill before the nerf and it was possible to 3 heal! insane starts
[4:49:20] Birraga: @Yagr6 they make way more than enough money from the event
[4:49:22] Gloorius: xD
[4:49:22] Rictamar: strats*
[4:49:24] Foodmanchewww: max isn't the problem, not even close. He's very good at what he does
[4:49:30] TheFDH: I've been watching Sloot, hoping he can get third
[4:49:42] Vimelo: and getting to a 2nd reset only benefits Liquid
[4:49:45] Coriollis: yeah Echo knew Razs was not dying on first reset, Scripe said the fight was longer than Sire Denathrius by 4-5 mins
[4:49:46] EnragedSushi: Doesn't matter.   WITH the nerf Echo still finished it quicker.  Liquid struggled half their day to get the kill after the NERF.
[4:49:51] Powshy: didnt they nerf it when Liquid was asleep
[4:49:53] Provision_: @Yagr6 depends on sponsors / contracts etc
[4:49:57] ZakuzaGB: BDGG have stopped raiding for a bit cuz xmas
[4:50:00] Nathanonfire: i disagree echo on slyvanas for example they need a whole more 5% when they could hardly get to 50 but they came out and found that 5 % and won
[4:50:00] Kratosjr1: The Org is still making money at 2nd place
[4:50:04] mmo_kenna_: i agree, without the nerf it goes over Xmas. That God pull wouldve been a low % wipe
[4:50:06] KizaruGR: Google shows Santa's position in the world but I can clearly see he is on Twitch!
[4:50:13] Rictamar: @allisonkielle yet Liquid took an extra 2 hours to kill post nerf and copied Echo's start lel
[4:50:22] Laluzmia: I am sure Max is on the hot seat feel bad for him
[4:50:23] Breakernaut: Team Liquid has a near infinite budget I don't think they really care as an org about being the best. Just being in the top 3 for most things are good enough for them
[4:50:25] WhiteKnight74648: rukiPray
[4:50:30] Birraga: The streaming of the race too profitable, liquid will never get dropped
[4:50:32] imdonexd: @Yagr6 as long as they make money they dont care, just look at how much money is in NA league of legends despite getting spanked by EU korea and china every year
[4:50:32] SeckSymbols: @EnragedSushi Thats because Echo had been pulling all day so they had the muscle memory already built up, Liquid had to wake up and get back into the groove of things
[4:50:35] Birraga: they make way more than echo
[4:50:35] mmo_kenna_: more like 3-4 hours after nerf
[4:50:41] Nathanonfire: @mmo_kenna_ same was said about slyvana but echo did it i disagree 100% echo would have killed it before reset
[4:50:48] Alacod: Yeah it's not about winning. Orgs get sponsors and those sponsors make money off views. So the org is still winning
[4:51:01] Powshy: @Nathanonfire if youre talking about finding the damage pre-nerf they needed to find 15% in like 20 seconds. Not happenin
[4:51:07] cinnamints: @Gylduran Yep, that's why Liquid didn't expect nerfs. They were consistently in the last phase & ended the night with the lowest % pull as of that time in the race, so they expected to duel it out the next day.
[4:51:23] Laluzmia: Laluzmia subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[4:51:27] Provision_: @Birraga well Liquid is known in all Esport, not just WoW ofc they got more budget

[4:51:39] DiranJei: I remember when he thought he was 2 chesting this lol
[4:51:47] Nathanonfire: @Powshy 15%? no they had an 8% pull it was def doable
[4:52:19] Rictamar: @EnragedSushi @cinnamints then Echo got it lower before the nerf, in waaayyy fewer pulls and 1 shot it after nerf...they were superior the whole boss
[4:52:27] Nebulizer87: if they ever fix Divine Toll bug this will be a lot easier for H.Pals
[4:52:28] Breakernaut: Liquid was basically the OG e-sports org. They have such a catalogue of teams in almost everything. They care about sponsors and just putting on a good show most the time
[4:52:31] Coriollis: took the res in the wind charge LUL
[4:52:41] erageK: echo was aleays ahead in rasza
[4:52:42] SeckSymbols: @EnragedSushi You pull count andy's are fucking weirdos
[4:52:52] erageK: they did  more talking before pulls
[4:53:04] erageK: they even were the 1st to do phase 3
[4:53:05] Powshy: @Nathanonfire I mean that 8% left was them doing all the min maxing they could. I get what your saying but as Towelie said that was just mathematically impossible.
[4:53:06] Alacod: that's some nasty damage
[4:53:28] Malnar1123: ew AV 16
[4:53:30] metavahn231: no loot
[4:53:32] blumoomoon: ;o
[4:53:39] Asuo_: Blizz clearly went into panic mode when they realized without nerfs the boss would live through christmas
[4:53:40] Nathanonfire: @Powshy they said the exact same thing about slyvana it was mathmatically impossible but they did it
[4:53:42] MrsPyra: @Nathanonfire I watched that 8% pull, i think was doable but whew it was dps demanding cause that enrage was hitting them every time. I think it needed the nerf. Just not sure on the timing of said nerf.
[4:53:50] Cheapesttactics1: did black temple no glaives:(
[4:53:56] roflpotamus: enh shaman is very strong in m+
[4:54:04] ItsXolten: u have to time the key
[4:54:06] slothonlsd: can change only when u time keys
[4:54:09] Sluggs_: she only shows up if you time it
[4:54:12] Gillettefuzionz: you can only change if you time it
[4:54:13] Provision_: @Nathanonfire without the nerf we surely were waiting for week 3. Blizzard did not want this to go longer than Chismass for reasons. But they made the call on the wrong time
[4:54:13] Sprinklerz: no change lady when you fail
[4:54:15] Antoinas: you can only change if you time it
[4:54:22] Coriollis: nah only timed
[4:54:29] Rictamar: @MrsPyra well Scripe said they possibly could've 3 healed it, which is nuts

[4:54:34] Zebingt0n: same as 16
[4:54:34] ItsXolten: if its your key and you time it you can't change it either
[4:54:45] Powshy: @MrsPyra my thoughts exactly. I watched most of the prog on that boss. That nerf  was very necessary, just not a good time for it
[4:54:54] Nathanonfire: @Provision_ it wasnt the wrong time... this isnt a blizz event they have 0 obligation to cater to the RWF what so ever
[4:55:03] SeckSymbols: @MrsPyra I dont take everything Scripe says as factual
[4:55:29] LoremasterMarthan: They gave the last phase like a full extra minute almost
[4:55:30] ItsXolten: Think they'll buff it again?
[4:55:33] Provision_: @Nathanonfire uhm without the RWF they would not even know this nerf was needed... Ofc they did this for RWF LUL
[4:55:34] Coriollis: evan the adds hp nerf was huuuuge
[4:55:35] Archiee: it measure out to about 45-50 sec extra time
[4:55:49] Powshy: @Nathanonfire ahhh yes, nerfing a boss that literally only 3 guilds are currently pulling had nothing to do with RWF. yup for sure
[4:55:54] kreloril777: if only blizzard could test there own shit
[4:55:55] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols you seem incredibly salty Liquid lost again, you okay?
[4:55:56] Breakernaut: @Provision_ Not blizz event but they enable drops post about it and everything. They do care about RWF it's naïve to think they don't
[4:56:04] lyfebloomtv: mw monk, dh, outlaw is the play
[4:56:04] nephttv_: put me in coach
[4:56:08] SilkeySmooth: balance
[4:56:12] MrsPyra: @Nathanonfire you're right but besides those 2 guilds who else was using that boss. That wouldnt make sense.
[4:56:19] Provision_: A lot more nerf cming next patch for sure, they just wont as long RWF was happening

[4:56:58] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols lolol go outside man, its not that big of a deal. The better guild won. Just be happy it was a fun race
[4:57:04] Nathanonfire: @Provision_ didnt say they didnt care but they dont have to cater to the race RWF is purely a data build for them to tune the raid besides that there is no blam to blizz fucking anything up because they have nothing to do with the race unlike MDI for example
[4:57:05] Breakernaut: @kreloril777 How are they suppose to test? Give themselves the best gear and just try? Maybe the devs suck at the game?
[4:57:08] Provision_: @Breakernaut why Blizzard than has a discord communication with RWF racers?
[4:57:11] nephttv_: yes sir, Hunter main for this tier
[4:57:14] itblost: I’m pooping guys
[4:57:15] radkkos: @Gylduran He's right, you're quite salty.
[4:57:17] Powshy: @Nathanonfire that nerf literally effects only 2 guilds at that time and the timing helped one out immensely. Keep huffing that copium (and for the record as Towelie said Echo looked a lot cleaner anyways but the nerf was suspect)
[4:57:19] PeewPew: why nerfs? I feel like this is easier than Castle Nathria was
[4:57:36] SeckSymbols: @Gylduran Why are you insinuating I am upset simply for questioning whether a 3 heal is possible?
[4:57:38] Coriollis: after new year 2nd week , I bet everyone is on a break till than

[4:58:03] CloudPants8081: candy crush nerf inc cooksuXEZ_HF
[4:58:22] PvtHudson093: The takeaway from this i raids shouldbt be released around Holidays
[4:58:23] radkkos: They nerf cuz they have 2. It's not funny to anyone to watch a RWF for weeks and, on top of that, they have to target  everyone else, not just those 2 guilds. If they cant kill, no one can.
[4:58:23] low0r: Do you think the start times should always be the same to prevent this in the future?
[4:58:33] cinnamints: @Breakernaut You're right. Blizzard doesn't seem to understand boss difficulty with any nuance, which is concerning b/c it means they don't have "tuning dials" to adjust, they only have baseball bats.
[4:58:34] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols nothing to do with that, your previous comments indicate you think the win was unfair. Its fine, you are entitled to your opinion. I'm happy the race was fun :)
[4:58:38] Keyastaron_: they should just farm M+ 4Head if it went to reset
[4:58:44] Provision_: RWF should be world wide scheduled. Not have a 10 hours difference
[4:58:50] Nathanonfire: @Powshy what are you talking about? i agree echo was the better team 100% all im saying is this isnt a blizz event so no blame to them at all they dont need to be better lol the dont have to cater to the race
[4:58:52] Nebulizer87: no excuse to have not set in a plan to move to global release

[4:59:09] Alsparq: it was a great race though with a bummer of a finish
[4:59:12] Nathanonfire: thats exactly what they did
[4:59:14] shiftfazed: blizzard could care less about the race
[4:59:18] MackPlays: They didn’t care who won clearly
[4:59:24] Coriollis: we're tuning the bosses for the comunity Kappa
[4:59:25] Provision_: But no other guild was there other than 4? LUL
[4:59:27] shiftfazed: They're not involved with it
[4:59:30] Rictamar: They have never cared
[4:59:32] kreloril777: @Breakernaut ..They have internal testers, small/medium/large test cases they could of executed. define parameters, they know this; but every release they dont do this.
[4:59:34] Rictamar: its not an official event lol
[4:59:37] Rictamar: people are stupid
[4:59:38] radkkos: All they have to do is make a race based on how fast ppl killed the last boss since the patch came live on their region, regardless of being at NA, EU or China.
[4:59:43] SeckSymbols: @Gylduran I didnt comment on thie race at all outside of differences in pull count and how if you take that into consideration you're a weirdo. Every RWF raider would say you're a weirdo for being hung up on pull count
[4:59:44] CloudPants8081: why not stop the world First and focus on the casuals
[4:59:58] Alaquane: Blizzard saying we aint workin on christmas
[5:00:02] radkkos: @kreloril777 they cant predict human error at their lvl.
[5:00:03] SilkeySmooth: the wfr should have started after the holidays
[5:00:05] codeExecutor: liquid got more firsts tho
[5:00:07] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols so would say the best guild won?
[5:00:11] PvtHudson093: As i said the raid should have been pushed till after the holidays
[5:00:11] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal during the WoW:Dragonflight marathons. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[5:00:12] mavericks312: they were only the better guild on the last boss and that's what mattered
[5:00:12] MackPlays: Blizzard doesn’t see an extra dime from RWF and their game isn’t made for it so they don’t care
[5:00:12] Admiller0: 10000% agree
[5:00:13] Provision_: @Gylduran and there is the problem. Or they support it and make changes, or dont touch it and do patches as normal?
[5:00:14] Nathanonfire: @CloudPants8081 the race isnt a blizz event its a event put on by the community
[5:00:25] nouwandhi: Why Liquid killled other bosses 1st?
[5:00:26] Coriollis: tbh Blizz dropped the ball on alot of stuff , from tank balance to professions bans xD
[5:00:36] Nathanonfire: @SilkeySmooth then blame the guilds they are the only ones who do this event not blizz
[5:00:36] Vyadore: The world first is a fun way to figure out if the bosses are tuned properly
[5:00:40] Rictamar: @Provision_ I don't think they will ever support it because they can
[5:00:41] lyfebloomtv: dont worry about it too much, we will get prenerf raszageth in classic dragonflight in 12 years
[5:00:43] radkkos: I wonder if ppl would be here crying if Limit won

[5:00:49] Rictamar: @Provision_ can't do worldwide release
[5:00:57] Asuo_: We knew it was all about timing when they opened all difficulties at once. They wanted this shit dead ASAP
[5:01:06] SeckSymbols: @Gylduran In this particular instance sure, but that doesnt mean you get to insinuate I am upset for questioning something Scripe says. So next time, don't put words in my mouth
[5:01:10] wraithynn: wait so who was the better guild echo or liquid ?
[5:01:11] SilkeySmooth: @Nathanonfire i do blame the guilds the wfr is not a blizzard event
[5:01:15] Nathanonfire: @Gylduran yes they can
[5:01:17] Coriollis: echoesportMadge bring the pitchforks
[5:01:18] Provision_: @Gylduran well than they should patch these things with patch notes, not randomly like now.
[5:01:23] MrsPyra: Its already a thing bc its released to US a day early
[5:01:23] radkkos: You're delusional.
[5:01:24] CloudPants8081: cooksuXEZ_HF
[5:01:24] EnragedSushi: LOL sounding heavy Liquid in here
[5:01:26] Sylphy_TV: KEKWlaugh
[5:01:32] DisparagingTurtle: All wow channels would need to be in emote only mode for at least 48 hours KEKW
[5:01:34] nouwandhi: Why Liquid killled other bosses 1st?
[5:01:35] Dcarter: I’m just here for the crazy takes people have
[5:01:35] SeckSymbols: Remember how upset Gingi got when Liquid got a bugged pull of Anduin?
[5:01:35] Deadahead4: Deadahead4 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 66 months! 
[5:01:36] Mauraderss: Was bad form to implement nerf first thing in the morning. IMO should have done it while guilds were actively pulling
[5:01:39] shiftfazed: I mean who actually gives s two fucking shits, winning is irrelevant
[5:01:45] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols lolol relax buddy, its not that serious LUL
[5:01:47] VaughanVenture: Imagine being a Blizz employee and being told you had to work over the holidays to support a community created race that only involves 40 out of millions of players. Good for blizz.
[5:01:48] Breakernaut: ItS NoT A BlIZZaRD EvEnT tHeY DOn'T CaRe
[5:01:49] Lostdogal: 100%, blizz controlled prog the whole way. Still enjoyed th erace though. I dont make any money off it so who gives a shit lol
[5:01:52] Dcarter: Bc it’s clear people don’t understand how things work
[5:01:56] CloudPants8081: towNut3
[5:02:02] Teriyakibro: luxthoKEKSh
[5:02:06] mavericks312: it's cool the echo astros have this one
[5:02:07] DisparagingTurtle: Clipped and shipped
[5:02:08] CloudPants8081: towBolvar towNut3
[5:02:09] justnvincible: clip it
[5:02:10] itz_blinktv: CLIP IT
[5:02:11] SeckSymbols: Just hope it wasn't Josh's KEKW
[5:02:14] DJ_PWNZ: whose dick> method josh>? @Towelliee
[5:02:15] BubbaChubbs420: already clipped
[5:02:16] radkkos: @vlex14 Exactly!!!
[5:02:16] Sprinklerz: LSF inc :)
[5:02:16] MackPlays: Already clipped and on LSF
[5:02:17] Provision_: @vlex14 i bet enough will sign up for it...
[5:02:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Clipped and shipped LUL
[5:02:24] Nathanonfire: @Dcarter ya because only streamers and content creators know anything?
[5:02:28] cinnamints: @blakenbaked I hate that to be taken seriously, ppl have to overstate Echo's performance in this raid (in which they let Liquid R&D strats on 6/8 bosses while Echo geared, then used those strats). Echo was strong on Rasz, but Liquid ended that last night with the % lead.
[5:02:32] Powshy: @Nathanonfire Just because its not a blizzard event doesnt mean the untimely nerf wasnt a bad decision Im not really sure how thats controversial
[5:02:33] CloudPants8081: tppowerFree
[5:02:34] twistedstick1: BDGG lets go. They can still get 3rd.
[5:02:37] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee EU should vs EU and America should vs America no more time zone nonsense
[5:02:50] SeckSymbols: @Dcarter Nathon on point
[5:02:54] Nathanonfire: @Powshy not on blizz to cater to this race what so ever
[5:02:56] Rictamar: 3 wins in a row is incredibly dominant, Echo are elite. Liquid pushing them all the way is nice to see, otherwise it would be boring
[5:02:58] skrin001: i hate echo cause of they all left cause of josh. I will never chear for them. I will chear for method though
[5:03:00] c0mmander_starscream: EU/NA Vs China
[5:03:01] wowking35: IM NA 4 life
[5:03:06] VaughanVenture: @Provision_ That's an insane take. No, lmao they would not.
[5:03:16] Mauraderss: EU sympathizer confirmed
[5:03:17] xmedpakx: liquid is a lot of Eu players though,, its kinda EU Vs EU
[5:03:18] BubbaChubbs420: @SilkeySmooth it's a global game though
[5:03:18] MackPlays: NA is fat and lazy
[5:03:29] Powshy: @Nathanonfire but . . . . they did cater to the event. They nerfed the boss, that in fact IS catering to this event
[5:03:33] CloudPants8081: PokMaskedpika
[5:03:37] host_255: just give them their own tourny realm to knock themselves out with
[5:03:38] Provision_: @vlex14 you also forget that RWF create free advertisement for WoW? You never see 200k+ viewers in WoW other than RWF and MDI
[5:03:44] Coriollis: I just wish we had more guilds of Echo/Liquid caliber and we have more than 2 horse race
[5:03:45] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[5:03:45] hoyhoy007: KEKW
[5:03:53] Alaquane: skyline over 1200 attempts
[5:03:53] temp3st98: @skrin001 lol why echo had nothing to do with it, it was in method though
[5:03:54] canniik: I'm still trying to figure out though, we're echo fully geared or did they stop doing splits because they thought they had enough to scrape through the fight? Could that have done it more comfortably if time wasn't an issue?
[5:04:01] MrsPyra: KEKW
[5:04:04] Nathanonfire: @Powshy no? lol not catering to the race ... theyt catered to their raid
[5:04:07] lithium364: pulling until people die, wouldnt be the first time in esport
[5:04:12] CloudPants8081: china is smart cooksuXEZ_HF
[5:04:14] shimwood: China's like Capt America, they can do this all day LUL
[5:04:14] xxKrayzie: less talk more pew pew
[5:04:19] Larc9783: State sponsored Meth supply too probably
[5:04:24] Vamulol: @Towelliee  very impressed by BDGG / Sloot tbh
[5:04:25] pathmd: rwf was better when it was not streamed
[5:04:28] TheFDH: Do you think BDDG will get third?
[5:04:28] BubbaChubbs420: they just make a bot EZ
[5:04:29] Alacod: did blizz ever renew their contract with china?
[5:04:39] Rictamar: @canniik that makes their win more impressive imo, they spent a day and half extra doing splits because they were slow and STILL won lol
[5:04:44] Coriollis: haven't seen China realy pushing bosses since mythic Avatar/KJ days
[5:04:48] DisparagingTurtle: Those china raiding guilds dont mess around
[5:04:59] Mauraderss: BDGG is just echo II at this point
[5:05:14] XFaunii: @Alacod nope
[5:05:19] c0mmander_starscream: The avg. China guild has 5 guys on stand by just to rotate in shifts

[5:05:24] Mauraderss: Method has come a long way in the last year
[5:05:27] BubbaChubbs420: Sloot is a damm good tank
[5:05:33] Nathanonfire: no one thought limit could do it but they did???
[5:05:38] SilkeySmooth: the wfr will always be a 2 guild race
[5:05:43] Rictamar: you have to be a day quicker which is nuts
[5:05:46] mavericks312: we need liquid sloot
[5:05:46] nouwandhi: How come Liquid killled other bosses 1st?
[5:05:54] canniik: @Gylduran Yeah that true. I guess thats where the tactics and planning comes in very useful
[5:05:59] Mauraderss: Echo does it
[5:05:59] Vamulol: @Towelliee  ye but isnt that the "team" around it now? Facilities,...
[5:06:07] pathmd: No one compares to Ben. I feel like wow is a joke to him when you see him play PoE
[5:06:07] TheNoidd: that's like 1.5 16 hour raid days worth of progress
[5:06:07] Coriollis: Roger said the raids are like 5 days farming 3 days prog LUL
[5:06:13] Rictamar: @nouwandhi Echo took forever to do splits basically
[5:06:16] DisparagingTurtle: I would still argue Sloot is top 5 tank to ever touch the game
[5:06:23] Powshy: @Nathanonfire aight my dude, you keep huffin that copium. Im going to go out on a limb and guess youre an echo fan whos said their kill is slightly tainted from an untimely blizz nerf, why else would you just ignore reality?
[5:06:26] Yagr6: i think its closer than people making it out to be , i mean they killed it what 2 hours after echo
[5:06:34] pathmd: He is the best PoE player in the world and spends time playing wow
[5:06:41] Admiller0: be is quitting
[5:06:44] nouwandhi: @Gylduran thx
[5:06:50] Admiller0: ben*

[5:06:53] VaughanVenture: @Provision_ RWF had the equivalent viewership of like an asmongold stream. Hardly moving the needle for advertising.
[5:06:55] Rictamar: Ben is a world second raider and one of the top 2 PoE players in the world, madness
[5:07:01] TheFDH: the love of the game
[5:07:07] BubbaChubbs420: they get noticed
[5:07:14] DiranJei: Copium
[5:07:20] mavericks312: cause even at 3rd no guild outside the RwF is touching bdgg
[5:07:24] pocketdimension: @Yagr6 tack on the time they got for being NA
[5:07:26] Provision_: @vlex14 yet MDI get less viewers and they do support it...
[5:07:26] shiftfazed: who do you think is going to quit limit? @towelliee
[5:07:26] Nathanonfire: @Powshy im a liquid fan but im not biased im a realist echo wins no matter what they are the better team they reached raz a day earlier than liquid
[5:07:33] pereadin: Max said they don't even look at apps
[5:07:33] MackPlays: What else are they going to do, it’s content
[5:07:33] bmike: Maybe improvement for the person
[5:07:36] Mauraderss: They getting paid big bucks to race for 3 4 and 5 place. EZ money
[5:07:38] pereadin: it's all word of mouth
[5:07:47] pereadin: usually through M+ and then a raid pug test
[5:07:50] ThePawPaw: they all have low viewers because of 2-3mins ads every 15-20mins
[5:07:51] pereadin: and log analysis after
[5:07:53] Asuo_: Guilds 4-20 are just the AAA division for the MLB that is Limit/Echo
[5:07:55] SeckSymbols: Not to dog on BDGG, but they will likely get 5th if I were to guess. Method will likely finish ahead of them and Skyline will Skyline
[5:07:57] Gamingnutt: without them there is no race no?
[5:07:59] MYSTERY9000: Strategy formation maybe?
[5:08:04] EyeLidzzz: A sense of hard work and accomplishment knowing you’re in the top 10 guilds in the world is huge
[5:08:15] DisparagingTurtle: not wrong NODDERS
[5:08:37] DrakeDuude: hahahaha theres a reason they get the first kills js lol
[5:08:38] Bernardo994: hey santa
[5:08:49] Alaquane: rooBless
[5:08:51] VaughanVenture: @Provision_ Irrelevant. Blizzard does not many company-level decisions around Twitch viewership. If MDI took place on Christmas eve they would not be working over the holidays either.
[5:08:55] BubbaChubbs420: jinxed it
[5:08:56] Uutef: RIP meta
[5:08:59] DisparagingTurtle: inb4 academy 18
[5:09:02] ItsYojimbo: going to be a 16 ruby Kappa
[5:09:06] DenghisKhann: We love Piercing Gale, our favorite boss move!
[5:09:09] Powshy: @Nathanonfire Im not arguing that Echo wouldnt win. Im saing Bliz could have nerfed the boss when both were pulling to make it an actual race. Idk whats wrong with saying that. Its also just correct.
[5:09:20] c0mmander_starscream: INB4 more discord spys
[5:09:23] SeckSymbols: @Provision_ MDI got less viewers because of the shitty youtube contract
[5:09:42] Rictamar: @Powshy it was a real race that LIquid lost...
[5:09:51] Coriollis: @Towelliee do you belive Echo/Liquid raised the barrier to entry in RWF so much that is intimidating/discouraging for alot of guilds?
[5:09:52] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[5:10:17] Powshy: @Gylduran Sure thing.
[5:10:20] Vamulol: @Towelliee paying people for splits...
[5:10:22] Rictamar: and Echo is better than them LUL
[5:10:26] DisparagingTurtle: Youtube contracts are like Sony making random games exclusive. its just annoying and tedious
[5:10:26] Nathanonfire: @Powshy sure i agree they could have but they dont have too because they dont put the event on they have no obligation to be fair but when echo reaches raz a day earlier than liquid its not much of a race any more it become obvious
[5:10:30] BubbaChubbs420: more resources
[5:10:30] MackPlays: They don’t have more money than Liquid
[5:10:34] SeckSymbols: When Limit was first starting their RWF careers, they weren't in an org
[5:10:37] c0mmander_starscream: more money for philly cheesesteaks
[5:10:43] Alaquane: larger support network. had all their crafters
[5:10:53] Haselhoof: why//?
[5:10:56] Powshy: @Nathanonfire Liquid was to Raz before Echo.
[5:11:03] idenkaz_: sponsers like: about that KEKW
[5:11:10] xmedpakx: I was very impressed with Liquid's morale after getting that slap after waking up TBH
[5:11:10] Powshy: Liquid was 7/8 when Echo was 6/8
[5:11:11] DrakeDuude: ya i think they could even cut the production channel and the castors
[5:11:18] Zayvion: Zayvion subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[5:11:19] Nathanonfire: @Powshy liquid reached raz in 6 days echo did it in 5
[5:11:24] Nextrousity: how you feeling about ruby life pools currently in m+
[5:11:24] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || DRAGONFLIGHT 10.0.5 TRADING POST OVERVIEW - NOT A BATTLEPASS youtu.be/0v7q_ctBKmM
[5:11:27] Uutef: then you get problems like bdgg had with sloot's power
[5:11:29] ItsYojimbo: ya normal people arent paying thousands for analysts and software engineers to build algorithms to figure out the exact way to gear everybody in seconds LUL
[5:11:35] kreloril777: they were what spending a couple million a day to stream that?
[5:11:36] Rictamar: @Powshy you are so salty they lost AGAIN lol
[5:12:00] SeckSymbols: @Powshy Liquid also did hours upon hours of pulls on pre nerf bosses like Kurog and Dathea
[5:12:01] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:12:07] Mauraderss: I’d love to see @towelliee make a m+ team and compete this year Pog
[5:12:10] DisparagingTurtle: you can standin the same one
[5:12:11] Powshy: @Gylduran you actually give a shit enough to flame people who arent even talking to you. touch grass my dude
[5:12:14] Provision_: @Powshy Yet Echo got passed 65% faster than Liquid etc. So yeah only prove Echo execution was better
[5:12:20] Dcarter: Okay the back and forth can stop now
[5:12:22] Sylphy_TV: Is Ele'Sham good
[5:12:25] Sylphy_TV: ?
[5:12:26] beepingnoise: echo played cleaner and progressed faster on the final boss.  stop arguing about nothing
[5:12:30] Dcarter: I don’t care which guilds you wanna ride but enough
[5:12:33] SeckSymbols: @Gylduran Dude, you're such a cunt. Let people discuss things without claiming they are upset. Jesus Christ leave people alone
[5:12:34] Coriollis: ye RWF is not for you another 19 buddies , it became a logistic/trading/gold-money beast for the top race
[5:12:39] jason_tacey: Man watching this Lions vs Panthers game makes me nervous KEKW
[5:12:41] Rictamar: @Powshy Take the L, you precious team loss lolol
[5:12:43] DisparagingTurtle: God yes. Ele Sham is amazing rn

[5:12:53] Powshy: @Provision_ no I agree, thats whats funny I think echo is the better guild. I wish blizz was better at makignt he race an actual race
[5:12:55] IsoBecky: IsoBecky subscribed with Prime. 
[5:13:08] Provision_: @Coriollis yeah think people dont realize how much money flows from RWF LUL
[5:13:08] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols whoa whoa, ripping the C word for no reason, calm down its all memes
[5:13:18] Powshy: @Gylduran my brother I have no ties to liquid, you clearly tie a lot of your personality to Echo. Enjoy that.

[5:14:00] Coriollis: @Provision_ I know sepulcher they said was arround 300k just from ads - Echo side
[5:14:04] Provision_: LUL
[5:14:05] Alaquane: @Gylduran  you're genuinely being a bully. Dcarter has asked people to stop. please do so.
[5:14:07] Dcarter: They aight
[5:14:13] Thralazaar: they are good but enhance is just better so most play enhance
[5:14:16] beepingnoise: liquid sort of played themselves this RWF playing late and starting later in the day
[5:14:17] Cheapesttactics1: I hear their dmg isn't consistent
[5:14:19] Powshy: @Gylduran thats. . . . terrible. Honestly. Why do that?
[5:14:19] TheFruitee: Ele shamen are either great for single target, or great for cleave. Not both
[5:14:22] Affiiance: They all switched to Evoker
[5:14:23] SeckSymbols: @Powshy The dude is so on that Echo dick its insane, he see's people having normal discussing an goes "OMG Liquid boy be mad!" I get more people who act like normal human beings when I do my job answering peoples DM's on twitter
[5:14:29] PidiaP: They need to nerf enhance more, back to windfury bot
[5:14:30] Powshy: @Gylduran like thats sociopathic
[5:14:32] Holysal: issue with ele is they have to pick ST or AOE and cant have both
[5:14:53] Provision_: @Coriollis but well they also need to pay all the bills to fly people over etc
[5:14:55] cinnamints: @Powshy It's true. And IIRC they ended the last night with the lowest % pull on Rasz. It's so weird to see people claiming Liquid was behind before the nerfs. They fkd up on healer comp, but had bought themselves time to work that out by leading for most of the race.
[5:15:03] Dcarter: This is such a calm relaxing dungeon
[5:15:04] SeckSymbols: Just block the Gylduran guy, your life will be better for it. Its why their Dad went for milk and never came back
[5:15:06] Rictamar: @Powshy relax relax, we are supposed to stop, so I'm stopping :)
[5:15:12] Powshy: @SeckSymbols the cesspool that is the WoW community always really shows itself after a RWF
[5:15:24] metavahn231: algathar academy 17 PLEASE
[5:15:29] Powshy: @Gylduran you need some professional help my dude
[5:15:49] Coriollis: @Provision_ ofc ofc nothing is cheap I get it and I don't mean we should limit the RWF budget that would be silly, was just saying they are established brands who dominate
[5:15:50] hgizaira: I believe you can't get the same key when you time it
[5:16:04] ItsXolten: @Powshy You sound upset, trolling is not sociopathic lol

[5:16:47] metavahn231: why RWF people still crying, it was a bad race anyways, no one seemed to care about it this time
[5:16:48] Provision_: @Coriollis yeah, but also reason why it very hard to even compete in RWF, you need a whole orgenization to manage it etc. It not just having 2 weeks off and raiding
[5:16:49] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[5:17:03] Powshy: @cinnamints oh totally, again I really just wish there wasnt so much inconsistencies with the RWF and I do wish Blizz was more involved. Part of me thinks they dont get involved because they dont want the heat when they fuck up
[5:17:12] pathmd: They were equally skilled raid comp picks which made Echo better at sparks and thus lead to less wipes. DK tank and quick on the evoker heals won the raid. Thus Max and analyst would to be to blame the most. Would have been nice to see organic progression through this race though. Many of Liquids wipes were prior to nerfs. Only like 8 wipes on Dethea post nerf (Echo had 50ish) and wasted more pulls on unnerfed Kurog. They also spent one full day on completely unnerfed Ras.
[5:17:16] Rictamar: @SeckSymbols lol
[5:17:16] Dcarter: Relax no need for that
[5:17:30] DisparagingTurtle: Free key then

[5:17:37] SeckSymbols: No need for the Patriots to lose to the Raiders but they did LUL
[5:17:45] Coriollis: @Provision_ yeah thats why I said it would be great if more than 2 guilds would compete for the first position with actual odds to challenge them
[5:17:46] Dcarter: I should ban you for that
[5:17:49] Dcarter: Lmao
