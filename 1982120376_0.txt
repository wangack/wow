[0:25:36] preauxton: !top
[0:25:36] Nightbot: If there is a character name at the top, he is on random !streak file with no game-play changing mods. If there's not, there's a good chance hes doing Tainted Lost to Mother streak on a different file. If theres a timer at the top, he's probably doing !speedrun

[0:35:00] StickyKey: idm watching adds once in a while but the other day i was watching a streamer he had ads for 5 minutes and after watching them i watched him for 5 minutes and then 5 more minutes of ads and i just quit it :D
[0:35:05] Damanking: Wasn't that after they did the poll and asked if everyone subbed for Emotes or Ad removal?
[0:35:23] 999avatar999: Wait wtf, when was that?

[0:35:52] StickyKey: does turbo give you no ads on all channels?
[0:35:54] MissingMatter: Well, like MC and BWL if you could heal you basically had to only heal. I was really hybridized and in ZG I could DPS, off-tank, and heal.

[3:48:19] ItsJustSam: Howdy! :D Welciome. :)
[3:48:41] The_Strockler: Is BoS still around?
[3:49:00] ItsJustSam: Not much. Started Dragonflight and played 7.5 hours today. So I'm dropping my kids off with you. LUL
[3:49:19] The_Strockler: who was the guy that used to run BoS? I completely forget
[3:49:29] Shace616: I wish we still had something like the Boiler days. The nostalgia I have for those days for some reason.
[3:49:29] Heavenly_Heathen: How does summoning work?
[3:49:30] lizmol2: ya i was about to hop into dragonflight myself do the new dream stuff
[3:49:46] Heavenly_Heathen: @the_strockler You mean this streamer right here? Or Richard Hammer? lmao
[3:49:53] ItsJustSam: Nice! I've only gotten maybe 1.5 hours in DF. Been opening the the other Horde races.
[3:50:20] lizmol2: rip the cow
[3:50:24] tyranosaurusxx: Not the cow!
[3:50:26] EngeltheFallen: balt and dick ran BoS
[3:50:53] Bishox: yeah you gave up on songflower for some reason LUL
[3:51:26] ItsJustSam: Anywho, I'm gonna lurk. Have a great stream and raid. :D
[3:51:29] MistahZed: LUL
[3:52:29] The_Strockler: @Heavenly_Heathen idr who it was, when the streams would happen in like 2013 there was someone other than cobalt that I primarily saw hosting, tbh until now I did not realize that Cobalt was associated and always though he was a sponsored or something lol. maybe it was hammer but I cannot find a pick of him to see
[3:52:36] Radund01: Are we on an alt?
[3:52:47] Endermanshadow: Damnit i was trying to wind down for the night but now ive got the urge to play wow lmao
[3:53:20] Heavenly_Heathen: @the_strockler Cobalt and Richard_Hammer were the two people who created, commentated, and paid for the prizes :)
[3:53:22] TheGameKing88: Man, Frog theme is too good.
[3:53:41] ComradeCurt: cobaltHi
[3:54:08] The_Strockler: hmm the more ya know
[3:54:15] Heavenly_Heathen: cobaltHi
[3:54:22] tyranosaurusxx: F it we ball
[3:54:30] TheGameKing88: This your own playlist Cobalt? It's got all the gaming bangers I never put into a playlist myself
[3:54:37] Radund01: How long, timewise, is the raid?
[3:54:40] The_Strockler: was there another big active tourney back then? maybe I am getting confused with something else
[3:55:02] Bishox: yeah around 2 hours for both
[3:55:04] Draleric: The_Strockler Boilr by Crumps
[3:55:13] Heavenly_Heathen: Yeah that one ^ lmao
[3:55:14] Cramer: each raid is around an hour and bidding for each is like 20 mins
[3:55:36] EngeltheFallen: so final goal clear naxx right <.<
[3:55:49] Bishox: at the end of each
[3:55:58] Cramer: aq 20 -> bid in stormwind -> run to zg -> bid at end of zg
[3:56:03] Techniquality: you bid in the end in stormwind, so you dont need to bring money to raid
[3:56:36] Cramer: just put it all on your bank for safety and bid on that
[3:56:37] nickwtfzorz: after the raid you tele to sw and do bids there
[3:56:38] Darkbrute: I think so
[3:56:39] Radund01: No
[3:56:49] Techniquality: best way is to send all money to bank, so you can click "Return' button which is instant mail
[3:56:52] nickwtfzorz: no need to bring  the gold to the raid
[3:56:56] Radund01: Just grab it after the raid.
[3:57:23] Fire_Gawd: i'd send all my extra gold to a safe character
[3:57:33] Lanoom1: celrSip
[3:57:34] Bishox: @CobaltStreak you arent rdy
