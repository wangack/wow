[4:30:10] Grullander: Hey @Swifty what mouse do you use?
[4:30:33] LKNpoolman: @Grullander Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB
[4:30:37] jaytem: @Swifty  Love your stuff! It's been 6 months since the last SwiftyIRL video, any new ones coming?
[4:31:12] Trimethicon: Put on track humanoids, they’re show up on your map
[4:31:23] Trimethicon: Players show up
[4:31:29] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[4:31:32] Grullander: @Grullander Thanks. I'm in the market for a new one, because the one I have they don't make anymore, or anything like it that I can find anyways....so I need some inspiration....lol
[4:31:56] LKNpoolman: I run the same one, it's amazing. Once you get one, you will NEVER buy another mouse again. The 12 buttons on your thumb make every single game you play soooooo easy since its pretty much the entire number pad. Its 1 to =
[4:31:59] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty
[4:32:03] AliHaeri: I can’t subscribe, can’t donate. It’s like my hands are tied and I didn’t do anything wrong
[4:32:08] HRK1337: you should attack on the left once you see an opening
[4:32:24] LKNpoolman: @Grullander Go snag one of those off amazon. its soooooo good
[4:32:29] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[4:32:48] LKNpoolman: never having to reach up and press any of the numbers make playing games sooo much better
[4:32:50] Digmadness: agreed
[4:32:59] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:33:07] Grullander: it's got a fee too many buttons on the thumb side...lol I ave a Corsair Vengance M95
[4:33:19] LKNpoolman: You can keybind everything to any number 1 through =, so 12 seperate keybinds
[4:33:28] Grullander: @Grullander it's got a fee too many buttons on the thumb side...lol I have a Corsair Vengance M95
[4:33:35] LKNpoolman: Nah, thats why its so good. You want all those numbers on your thumb
[4:33:37] AliHaeri: I stopped playing retail during Mists of Panderia.
[4:33:45] TiPera: hey there Swifty, how's hunter feeling right now?
[4:33:59] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:34:00] LKNpoolman: Youll question how you ever used a mouse without it
[4:34:24] Grullander: Mine has thumb buttons as well.
[4:34:31] Grullander: just not quite so many.
[4:34:31] insectplato: shadowmeld is good for guarding a base. rogues cnat find ytou
[4:34:38] Behemian: @LKNpoolman Don't forget to mention that the keypad on the side can be moved so that it fits your hand perfectly. Large hands, small hands.. does not matter.
[4:34:42] LKNpoolman: Sorry Swif, I was telling someone in chat about the Scimitar mouse we run and why its so good
[4:35:28] HRK1337: I was guarding bases at NE war tank back then, 1v2 against rogue/drood at around 2k8 mmr, was pretty fun and wild
[4:35:42] LKNpoolman: @LKNpoolman Ahhhh yes, it comes with a key to loosen or tighten a screw on the botom of the mouse that allows the number pad on it to slide forwards or backwards so itll fit your hand much easier
[4:35:51] AliHaeri: I never used any multi button mouse. I felt that it really distracted me from tanking.
[4:36:25] Grullander: @AliHaeri it's hard at first but once you get used to it, you will never want to go back. lol
[4:36:28] AliHaeri: I’m not really a PVP guy. I’m a PVE guy :)
[4:36:28] HRK1337: as a night elf tank warrior*
[4:36:29] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[4:36:37] TiPera: hey there Swifty, how's hunter feeling right now?
[4:36:40] LKNpoolman: @AliHaeri Are any of your moves on the number pad?
[4:36:59] StreamElements: Swifty is Partnered with Corsair! Click here to see all their cool stuff! https://cor.sr/Swifty
[4:37:23] HRK1337: what's your winrate RBG? @Swifty
[4:37:34] Behemian: I've been using the Scimitar since 2016. Before that I used the Naga. But the Scimitar has lasted me longer (had 2 of them since 2016). So they're durable :D
[4:37:37] AliHaeri: I like to have options with mouses. A 3 button mouse is all I need.
[4:38:07] LKNpoolman: Ohhhhhh nice. I like how you keybound those abilities
[4:38:12] hugelamp: Goodnight swifty and chat, have a good one roflgatorLove
[4:38:13] LKNpoolman: CHANGE YOUR TRINKETS!!!!!!!!!
[4:38:24] AliHaeri: Change trinkets! ;)
[4:38:26] Grullander: Check out the Corsair M95, you can't get it anymore.
[4:38:59] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[4:39:10] Arkitek: why check it out then
[4:39:38] LKNpoolman: Yeah, i run it kinda similar. Instead of saving those last 3 buttons as my CC stuff, I use the middle ones but I added shift to it. So its like "Shift + 4" etc.
[4:39:48] AliHaeri: I played vanilla classic and tbc classic with a simple 3 button mouse and I did fine.
[4:40:09] AliHaeri: It works for me.
[4:40:09] TiPera: what's that
[4:40:13] insectplato: do you use spy addon?
[4:40:17] TiPera: never seen it in game
[4:40:21] TiPera: what does it drop
[4:40:33] Behemian: @TiPera War Mode crate drop.
[4:40:42] insectplato: its pvp with warmode on
[4:40:56] TiPera: oh war mode thats why i never seen it
[4:40:58] TiPera: thank you
[4:41:10] LKNpoolman: @AliHaeri Right lol. We never had these fancy mouses growing up lol. But, once i got one, I realized how ungodly good it is not having to reach up and push any of the numbers when using abilites
[4:41:22] TheyCallMeUncleBro: how do you kow where it drops?
