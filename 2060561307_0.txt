[0:21:12] Braggardt: It's not great, but there's so much competition for quests it's kind of worth
[0:21:14] yuiona: i recently started leveling some classes in retail and it is really annoying when you reach lvl 60 that you just get teleported to orgrimmar and are forced to do the DF story. i wanted to finish the story i was doing man

[0:22:04] VallanceHeals: @Preachlfw My biggest achievement of the year so far is surviving two of your playthroughs in a rat game. Yes, I was a clown and a scientist and thus less likely to get killed, but that's a small detail.

[0:22:11] Geri_0123: cata duskwood is great tho

[0:22:27] midnite919: @Preachlfw you think you do but you don't
[0:22:39] Neverlast: I love Duskwood Thematically, just not mechanically. Sucks running back and forth.
[0:22:42] Clinona: Next gw2 patch is in a couple of weeks

[2:26:52] eximisprime: I wish Blizz would do something like FFXIV roulettes
[2:26:52] Pups_Gersky: I have a feeling that SoD over time will become the same as Ascension is, hybrid classes/spells and maybe a rogue like eventually.
[2:27:02] elderratt: MAYAN
[2:27:04] dirtylevel: Ashran is THE Worst city of all tho

[2:28:55] Markreivi: Rat Shit? ratJAM
[2:29:07] Arca94: Boralus feels like the closest thing to a 'real' city in this game imo
[2:29:17] NeeK_23: Borlaus was a living city, but also everything you needed was on one strip of street
[2:29:20] kaw_kaw: BfD is still great xp, like half a level
[2:29:37] HeffaBear: you were just in for a bad time in general as horde in bfa. bad town, bad campaign, bad racials, bad queue times

[2:30:32] DukePiewalker: bowl of scrying is old darkshore shit
[2:30:36] JakeZGR: @Preachlfw the scrying was for Darkshore
[2:30:36] MagicPants_99: BFD exp is still worth it after 30 and gear is still good
[2:30:39] Lungle: yup

[2:30:55] DzikiWegorz1223: beautiful music, shit location
[2:30:56] Lithirrdys: everything spread out, large, empty, illogical
[2:30:56] UniqeornRider: *imo
[2:30:57] ardsgena: I barely even remember it KEKW
[2:30:57] Allessii: oribos was trash with one mail box
[2:30:58] meercatsdot: it could have been all on 1 floor
[2:30:59] Braggardt: The Ashran camps were pretty shit
[2:30:59] dirtylevel: oribos was bad because of that no mount allowed area
[2:31:01] SiriusSion: so getting anywhere felt longer then it should
[2:31:01] mattyzees: the Oribos lap circles were bis
[2:31:01] BlindOwlInTree: its a circle
[2:31:02] Horfent: Oribos is trash incarnate
[2:31:05] DukePiewalker: BFA "cities" were worse.
[2:31:06] Biohazrd85: too spread apart and no mount areas sucked
[2:31:09] Disfideus: its efficient, thats all it is
[2:31:14] PalleGnom: The run from elevator teleport to flight path Despairge
[2:31:15] DvourZz: didnt play shadowlands and could not believe how souless oribos looked and felt
[2:31:22] pazernus: also everything looked identical so you always got lost
[2:31:25] mattbman: What about the WoD city, i cant even remember it
[2:31:26] JGrimz: that phial can be deleted after you’ve done the quest in darkshore
[2:31:33] LasyPanda: Zuldazar is worst WoW city
[2:31:34] DzikiWegorz1223: @DukePiewalker I actually love Boralus
[2:31:40] suprememook40: zuldazar was the worst
[2:31:41] BlooYed: > soulless KEKL
[2:31:43] JGrimz: 👍🏻
[2:31:43] YuushaEX: could we count the goblin starter zone as an entire city?
[2:31:44] Braggardt: Soullless, ironic
[2:31:49] JakeZGR: @Preachlfw the scrying was for early Darkshore quest
[2:31:51] Vinestra28: I stand by the city of serets would have been a better city
[2:31:52] Blackmarsh: @Preachlfw what do you think of warrior runes so far? do they change up gameplay alot?
[2:31:53] DukePiewalker: @DzikiWegorz1223 Fuck me I meant WoD xD
[2:31:54] IAmSolari: @DukePiewalker Boralus was arguably the best city they've ever made
[2:31:54] suprememook40: half of the horde stuff at docks, half at top of pyramid
[2:32:03] Mak2349: Cow man sitting in the corner was cool
[2:32:04] DukePiewalker: I apologize chat. I meant WoD.
[2:32:07] DukePiewalker: Brain fart.
[2:32:09] skuull23: bfa cities were great
[2:32:15] okeefe93: Oribos was too much of a game hub and not an actual city
[2:32:16] DukePiewalker: BFA was great.
[2:32:18] DzikiWegorz1223: @DukePiewalker haha, ok.
[2:32:37] Braggardt: Shattrath was just far too big, even with flying
[2:32:40] DukePiewalker: Oribos does get a lot of shit because the zones were disconnected.
[2:32:40] YuushaEX: okay then what's the best XIV city
[2:32:41] MeowgicTheCathering: oribos was the airport terminal of the afterlife YEP
[2:32:47] ApaGoGa: I bet 99% of the haters of BFA cities are the horde, since they had this stupid pyramid KEKW
[2:32:49] drivebyboocawkeh: how dare you compare those to stargates. stargates are instant
[2:32:49] Allessii: i forgot about that
[2:32:49] Geri_0123: the worst thing about zuldazar was the brutosaur WQ's dialogue triggering
[2:32:52] CockyCola: As a mage, it was fine :)
[2:32:56] suprememook40: or there was no hearth to your covenant from oribos!
[2:32:56] Allessii: that was sooo stupid
[2:32:59] mattyzees: travel sperm pog
[2:32:59] Mak2349: why do they hate portals so much ?
[2:33:00] Hupu_a: flashbang tunnel
[2:33:03] IAmSolari: Oribos felt like the airport in 28 weeks later
[2:33:04] amalgamrhowa: sperm
[2:33:07] HeffaBear: its criminal that suramar was used for 20 quests and a raid and then wasted completely after
[2:33:16] Impurite: The afterlife being 4 different theme parks is a stupid concept.
[2:33:21] Robix256: Getting dismounted for no reason was fun
[2:33:22] bigoldmeatpie: also the little annoyance of being kicked off your mount constantly in the different rooms
[2:33:32] IAmSolari: god I hate shadowlands so much
[2:33:41] IAmSolari: I'm having flashbacks
[2:33:49] neldorath_: oribos should have been a lot denser and there also was no need for a portal to the second floor
[2:33:59] YuushaEX: i never played it
[2:34:01] Disfideus: hmm yea suramar is probably my favourite city, now that you mention it
[2:34:03] Mak2349: @IAmSolari Breathe man breathe. It's over !!
[2:34:04] Daemavand: Its crazy how much has changed between one expansion

[2:38:02] enhanced2: Tier Yes, Others No
[2:38:03] VipMalis: only tier

[2:38:04] Shelana95: you need to kill them ones now
[2:38:04] Allessii: if you killed them once you unlock them'
[2:38:07] BurtikShaun: only tier nothing else
[2:38:15] TwitchViewRobot: You could argue that it increases the excitment from the vault i like it
[2:38:20] Mozza89: got my bis head from a raid I’ve never done XD
[2:38:21] xaiko8: You have to kill the boss first, then it can show in following weeks without killing the boss
[2:38:23] rilefors: @Preachlfw you get items from bosses you have killed
[2:38:27] IAmSolari: Is maldraxxus the worst zone they've ever made?
[2:38:27] Dracold77: I honestly liked WoD in a alot of ways - wished Blizz would tend to iterate rather than throw systems out entirely every xpac, see legions classhalls etc
[2:38:32] Allessii: follower mission
[2:38:37] Allessii: yes 9
[2:38:40] Disfideus: i got blackhand stuff iirc
[2:38:44] babios: Yes, blizzard has defined an order for the bosses. If you kill a boss ahead of that list you get the loot from all the previous ones. They did it so people will not get locked on specific bosses for target looting
[2:39:16] sunlight415: sunlight415 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! good god 50

[2:40:12] Wcvechten: Warfronts coulda been great for PvP
[2:40:14] MrBorisPavlov: modCheck
[2:40:15] FrizzGrim: one of the tragedies of death is missed opportunities, so it makes sense that shadowlands is the expansion of missed opportunities
[2:40:15] suprememook40: one good thing about SL is how they made the leveling alts easier
[2:40:16] Miss_Kas: modCheck
[2:40:17] Dreadzol: I suppose the biggest benefit of SL was how much they learned what we don't want anymore
[2:40:20] TheFuriyon: wasn’t it killing x number of bosses unlocked loot from the mission on the difficulty above what you did? I.e 9 hc bosses = mythic loot

[2:40:57] Mister_Earth: SMOrc Clap
[2:40:59] CockyCola: SMorc
[2:41:02] majkos: I still dislike great vault, it very quickly becomes a gamba, you do keys getting nothing for 10h hoping to see an upgrade in the vault
[2:41:04] PrimalTV: God no
[2:41:06] Vinestra28: Skins
[2:41:07] itzlabyrint: skins
[2:41:08] HeffaBear: class halls was legions dragon flying and they let it go sadg

[2:41:10] Disfideus: skins
[2:41:10] Mak2349: both
[2:41:11] Miskav: Skins
[2:41:13] Biohazrd85: people shat so much over artifacts and now its rose tinted goggle nostalgia
[2:41:13] daris888: skins
[2:41:14] dirtylevel: in terms of doing things to UNLOCK the skins
[2:41:16] Markreivi: Artifacts we dookie poo
[2:41:17] BlooYed: @Preachlfw Do you think that the "making content in advance" is a bad idea and they are having massive issues because of it right now (d4 issues etc). I feel like they just gotta work differently. That system is shit.
[2:41:18] ApaGoGa: True
[2:41:21] shinra40: nobbel
[2:41:23] Geri_0123: the skin unlock process was cool
[2:41:23] Disfideus: yeap true
[2:41:28] CockyCola: Eh
[2:41:32] Mak2349: oh yeah I'm not bothered by that KEKW
[2:41:36] Nathai: I liked the fact, that you always had a good weapon - even if nothing dropped in raids/dungeons
[2:41:41] Disfideus: looked jarring once the novelty wore off
[2:41:41] anda__: relics (or w/e the artifact upgrade things were called) were also just loads less exciting than weapon drops
[2:41:53] Mnevea: Honestly, why care about what other people have
[2:41:54] Hyvest: Getting a weapon upgrade also feels way more satisfying than just getting the thingies to slot into your artifact
[2:41:56] redroniksre: I didn't care that much, lots of people just mogged out of it
[2:41:56] Horfent: if My artifact makes me look cool, i dont give a fuck how others look
[2:41:58] demon_tiem: Yea that ain't bother me
[2:41:58] BigMightyena: You get an ashbringer, you get an ashbringer, everyoen gets an ashbringer KEKW
[2:42:00] Miskav: Nessie
[2:42:00] MrBorisPavlov: I did like hunting the sins though, like the hidden ones
[2:42:05] sliffz: Nessie
[2:42:07] MrBorisPavlov: *skins
[2:42:08] SiriusSion: I love wearing the hunter Artifact weapon cause it comes with a quiver
[2:42:09] itzlabyrint: wideNessie
[2:42:12] Disfideus: @Preachlfw netherlight crucible - needs to stay in the void forever
[2:42:13] rilefors: the skins, the questlines, the powernodes. the classfantasy. i loved almost everything about the artifacts @Preachlfw
[2:42:20] ChunkeyNinja: when its some famous weapon, not great
[2:42:25] IAmSolari: I didn't even think the model they made for ashbringer was that good...
[2:42:25] ChunkeyNinja: otherwise I liked it
[2:42:29] Dracold77: the skins were a cool goal to work towards - I mean di I need to even mention the mage tower? :D
[2:42:32] Geri_0123: some hidden ones were good, but some was just enter your orderhall daily and an event may trigger
[2:42:36] AngryFil: @MrBorisPavlov Sin Hunter is a legit cool name for something or someone
[2:42:46] sunlight415: they should have done more with class halls with other expacs
[2:42:48] Mister_Earth: Druids had it well in Legion looks wise
[2:42:49] itzlabyrint: i also liked the class mounts in legion
[2:42:55] Mak2349: It was a cool incentive to do stuff
[2:42:57] PlattyPu55_: the arcane mage staff had a cool secret skin unlock
[2:42:58] TwitchViewRobot: is the guild FAMILY just for close friends or open to the community ?
[2:43:04] MrBorisPavlov: The monk hulk hands

[2:43:10] dirtylevel: it's for fire mages
[2:43:10] zeppo3K: KEKW
[2:43:10] IAmSolari: didnt the arcane mage staff talk to you
[2:43:16] TheFuriyon: I’m still sad I only got 30/34 mage tower skins, just missed out on Druid @preachlfw
[2:43:17] UniqeornRider: yup
[2:43:18] Markreivi: Kael'thas's father's sword.

[2:43:42] Aeridan_: It's some ceremonial sword for high elf royalty i.e. his dad's sword
[2:43:44] Geri_0123: yeah still use aluneth transmogs for the voices
[2:44:05] Geri_0123: mage is always a correct choice
[2:44:06] Kayvonnn: fire bracers were big
[2:44:08] Mak2349: I loved ele shaman
[2:44:10] Gwyn_N7: Mage was my main in Legion
[2:44:10] jovens_v: Mage was a lot of fun
[2:44:11] anda__: mage is the main character class, expected outcome honestly.
[2:44:16] PlattyPu55_: i wish there was a way to get challenge mode sets for other classes across your account, didnt take into account wanting to re roll years down the line :(
[2:44:17] Ronny_Styles: Except for that time you got Norgannon's foresight
[2:44:20] Achny01: I started with mage and rerolled to monk
[2:44:21] Kayvonnn: got them first drop
[2:44:22] dirtylevel: parse'd 100 percentile with mage did you not?

[2:44:43] TheFuriyon: Mained warrior, the perfect version of warr
[2:44:44] Horfent: Legion class design was BIS imo
[2:44:44] brastilou: surrender to madness in legion was the most fun i ever had
[2:44:46] gungsunk: Stare
[2:44:47] Mak2349: POOGERS

[3:48:15] BraetonGreswold: RT is extremely 40k
[3:48:17] Mak2349: It's definitely worth a playthrough

[5:03:13] YuushaEX: yeah it was a bad launch
[5:03:20] Mina_the_Engineer: like they're spending a ton of resources simulating things to a level that isn't necessary for the scope of the game, so it runs like crap on basically everything

[5:38:05] realnzall: @Preachlfw I'm worried that Delves might get a timer as well
[5:38:12] neugassh: doin the same dungeons for 100 times is shit content

[5:38:17] Tonymal0nie: I mean even LFR and Heroics give vault now LUL never had so much fun with alts
[5:38:18] DzikiWegorz1223: @SpectraBG I'd like that if done correctly. But my issue is they didnt build up it over the years, so it wont be much  at the start of war within. Nothing like GW2 for example
[5:38:20] olemannen: @Preachlfw  timer...depletion...its all so dumb for a mainstream gearing up thing, i play with 3 people who have kids so we cant really take breaks
[5:38:28] Braggardt: nodders
[5:38:30] majkos: m+ key depletion is big issue as well

[5:38:56] thor_the_icelander: tooo many
[5:39:04] Farstrider__: I got a lot of any small amount of time in Eureka
[5:39:04] redroniksre: I used to be so deterred from M+. Subreddit made the community sound so much more toxic than i found
[5:39:04] SovexFFXIV: door bosses, ultimates, savage criterions :)
[5:39:06] GrebboGaming: Literally so common to waste like 20+ mins and not even finish the key
[5:39:08] turtleandfish: LuL
[5:39:12] Saitouakira: i agree with you mike, M+ at times feels like a giant waste of time
[5:39:13] Taldemarr: Missing self only -check?
[5:39:13] Eightbitmailbox: M+ is just a means for vault loot
[5:39:18] Wodiin: No idea.

[5:39:33] Tibbroar: destiny Despairge
[5:39:35] dontlookatme987: There is no problem with having content for hardcore players and seperate content for casuals
[5:39:40] Sebbywebz: Pog
[5:39:48] majkos: the fact that you can do like 10 m+ keys and get nothing from it, including great vault is abysmal
[5:39:50] Thelete: getting into endgame in wow is so hard if you are new
[5:39:55] brackers89: Just seen the hero talents for pres evoker (my spec), bit meh
[5:40:00] Saint473: @Preachlfw that is very true, destiny is giga unfriendly to new players
[5:40:00] Dracold77: for wo you basically need a grp to teach you....going into LFG on your own? Let's not KEKW
[5:40:06] cythis_91: Cheer100 Since they will most likely continue the trend of Season 4 raid revisits I would love the Devs to do a pre-patch poll to bring a back a Vanilla to Warlords of Draenor tier set armor up to modern graphics. Something to work for/look forward to at the end

[5:46:08] majkos: quick meth
[5:46:14] Phabey: that's part of why I really enjoy the WoW streams, they become quite podcasty which is chill
[5:46:19] Amyrantha_: @Preachlfw speaking of BG3 i am trying to get through it and the long rests are really taking me out of the story constantly. i play a druid so i often need my spell slots, and i feel i have to take a long rest every 5 minutes while i would prefer to focus on the story. did you have the same feeling?
[5:46:21] TouchingTurd: caleb3H

[5:46:39] Ragi_Fz: Listening
[5:46:51] sibepp: Is SoD worth i
[5:47:18] Traion: I only long rested when it was narratively appropriate
[5:47:28] Mina_the_Engineer: @Amyrantha_ a big part of dnd, and thus bg3, is resource management, so try to avoid using lots of spells each fight, be tactical with your slot usage
[5:47:43] cyriosly: You ever going to do a durge playthrough @Preachlfw ?
[5:47:44] GrebboGaming: @sibepp if you like Classic yes SoD is fun, it's closest thing to a Classic+ rn
[5:47:55] Geri_0123: honour fixes the action economy a bit, haste was very much overtuned
[5:47:56] Amyrantha_: alright thx. im only lvl 4 now so still lots of shit to go. maybe it'll get better in a bit
[5:48:00] realnzall: @Preachlfw My brother said exactly that: he really likes BG3 and will play it often, but he struggles to find the time because of his adult responsibilities
[5:48:01] Funningway: just play 4 barbs PepeLaugh
[5:48:08] bigoldmeatpie: the combat is definitely the worst part of bg3 for me

[5:48:59] DzikiWegorz1223: I played the divinity original sin 2 like that :D over the period of almost one year
[5:49:11] YuushaEX: honestly watching you play it it didn't WOW me
[5:49:18] Nupss: the game's size is only possible self published
[5:49:26] DukePiewalker: They already said their next thing wont be as big I believe
[5:49:28] crumbler81: almost 1000 hours in BG3, and I still haven't done a minthara playthrough LUL
[5:49:28] Lithirrdys: Game length is fine because of the pick up and put down nature the side stories and areas lean into
[5:49:30] realnzall: @Preachlfw Related to monoliths of a game: I already own Dark Souls Remastered, but I'm wondering whether for my first Soulslike game it's better to first play that game or first play Elden Ring because it's more accessible

[5:49:42] Geri_0123: I hate that every game has to be 100 hour +, older rpgs with 40-50 hours were much better
[5:49:55] Disfideus: its a pretty common problem with CRPGs
[5:49:57] crashuloxd: Well 3hour accident didnt help with time spent in act 3 KEKW
[5:50:01] rat4larry: exactly
[5:50:02] DzikiWegorz1223: @Geri_0123 agree. planescape torment is ideal for that

[5:50:35] GoodOldNeihtan: to be fair, a lot of it, is optional content
[5:50:36] shinra40: now wow? dead channel / meme
[5:50:38] StarstrikeXIV: @realnzall FWIW I bought Dark Souls remastered a while ago and hated it (skill issue tbqh). Beat Elden Ring a while back and have gone BACK to Dark Souls and am really liking it.

[5:51:18] Blacklm1492: what about LOTRO? Smadge
[5:51:18] Shelana95: God of War ?
[5:51:21] Braggardt: do it Madge
[5:51:23] trebolf: Monster Hunter World COPIUM

[5:51:28] dirtylevel: Armored Core 6 is 10 to 20 hours Kappa

[5:51:43] urbish_: YEP
[5:51:55] trebolf: Persona 3 COPIUM
[5:51:59] IZQT: Still playing a game from 2004
[5:52:04] Disfideus: yea kind of true
[5:52:07] redroniksre: Now that i tried the Tribes 3 alpha, thats all i want
[5:52:08] Wcvechten: honestly, yes
[5:52:10] SpiderXIV: would be nice if they gave us a chance to catch up
[5:52:13] GrebboGaming: I think AR is gonna be the next big step, like experience/tactile type stuff
[5:52:13] SuperKarti: cum queens waiting for you, don’t worry
[5:52:13] Ronny_Styles: And still theres way too tight schedules for devs and too much crunch time
[5:52:15] Doimos89: even more imagine doing a second playthrough of some of them KEKW
[5:52:17] urbish_: I have to remind myself that my list of games isnt a backlog and it is for fun LUL
[5:52:18] Dreadzol: as long as poe keeps updating I will never need another game YEP
[5:52:19] Edrem: Gamepass has actually been really good for shorter, smaller scoped games now
[5:52:20] dontlookatme987: are ppl really whining about getting a long playing game.
[5:52:23] Lithirrdys: My hope is that the new trend is to remove all those shitty microtransactions that every single game has to have because number go up
[5:52:27] tinyjazzhands: So many great games I haven't played yet, and I'm probably just gonna play Skull and Bones for the rest of the month Shruge
[5:52:30] Mina_the_Engineer: my backlog, not counting roguelikes I want to 100%, is something like 2k hours based off of average lengths

[5:52:38] Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1: I do have a ridiculous backlog
[5:52:40] Disfideus: for hardcore crpg fans, check out swordflight campaign for NWN1 - its even longer than bg3 and much more challenging difficulty wise
[5:52:40] Traion: I think the AAA industry will adjust to making shorter games instead of their live service stuff. You can sell multiple 60 buck games if they are each like 5-10h long
[5:52:47] redroniksre: Its very unpolished right now, but it feels sooooo good to zip around again, 16 v 16 CTF so fun

[5:53:41] urbish_: You know there are people who replay the entire FF14 MSQ LUL
[5:53:53] Bohya_: KEKW
[5:53:56] dirtylevel: artificially infleting play time(assassin's creed) is also not the play
[5:54:00] Amyrantha_: @Bohya_ what is TPK?
[5:54:04] Geri_0123: I liked how da:o, pillars, could be completed in like 40-60 hours

[5:54:14] GrebboGaming: Maybe if you have a D&D group, have them play BG3 instead lol
[5:54:16] kierancantxox: bg3 multiplayer is sooooooo time consuming but it is so chaotic fun
[5:54:19] trebolf: It's because you're Dipla KEKW
[5:54:22] Miyu_Fhey: Zepla would ditch you after the first stream :D
[5:54:22] Sebbywebz: BG3 collabs are hard because its impossible to co ordinate streamers for 3 months straight KEKW
[5:54:23] alwiro: xorpla would dip anyways :D
[5:54:25] Tyki_jp: Zepla, commit? Susge
[5:54:29] cyriosly: Have you seen the Starfield playerbase decline? 97% of its playerbase on stream dropped
[5:54:35] Bohya_: That's fair @sebbywebz NODDERS
[5:54:50] trebolf: @cyriosly Deserved KEKW
[5:54:53] Lithirrdys: could do a run with Chris Bex and Nupss Hmm but then who would do the work?
[5:54:53] Sebbywebz: @Bohya_ think how hard that would be KEKW
[5:54:57] SpiderXIV: was zepla asking you to be her +1 for a bg3 stream? @Preachlfw
[5:54:59] YuushaEX: could be a 24 hour thing you go to bed she wakes up
[5:54:59] dirtylevel: @Sebbywebz dnd DM struggles
[5:55:01] gimme_h: @cyriosly they'll be back when the toolkit whatsit comes out

[5:55:16] TheRealJinjix: @Preachlfw I've played 55h of Enshrouded this week, and it's still in Early Access, with like, half the map not ready... and I'm jonesing for more.

[6:03:37] BudBudBudBudBudBudBudBudB: very, VERY dated
[6:03:37] SpiderXIV: never played 11 so big HYPERS
[6:03:46] cythis_91: Sounds like Copium
[6:03:47] Nupss: DIESOFCRINGE you're so cringe Mike
[6:03:56] mesnFES: ff11 is not like is used to be, you can solo the entire game and every bad mmo mechanic is basically gone
[6:03:57] GrebboGaming: Is 11 still supported at all?
[6:04:01] biglonelytv: mike I thought you were an undead warrior
[6:04:01] SpiderXIV: critless
[6:04:02] Geri_0123: wouldn't the flat damage be better instead?
[6:04:05] andavaar: D:
[6:04:13] daris888: it is supported
[6:04:15] Mina_the_Engineer: the frequency overpower doesn't crit is very embarassing, you should probably fix that
[6:04:17] Braggardt: 11 is still going!
[6:04:19] Rysiel: 11 just had new story content and dark relic weapons added
[6:04:29] urbish_: I mean, youre playing classic wow LUL
[6:04:30] kierancantxox: i mean people still play lotro and thats is still chugging along with content
[6:04:31] mesnFES: 90k active characters in ff11, estimated at the moment
[6:04:32] Bohya_: New story in 11!? Why
[6:04:34] andavaar: DIESOFCRINGE

[6:04:41] mekia55: Because the gearing system is amazing that is why people still play it :P
[6:04:42] Edrem: FF11 is really chill, it's like old school runescape in a way
[6:04:46] dirtylevel: what about NeoCron?
[6:04:46] Rysiel: Voraicous Resurgence
[6:04:50] kaspiDev: This WA is like if you always got a notification when you got stolen from and could do nothing about it.
[6:04:51] Syrjyys: @Bohya_ Shruge Japan
[6:04:54] zxabu230: Original Galaxies was so good
[6:04:54] Tyki_jp: @alwiro Not so grindy lately, main issue with it currently is the awful UI and the controls. Beside that, the game is massive and offers tons of content. It's also solo friendly for 80% of the game
[6:04:56] nohomu67: D: What
[6:04:59] Dreadzol: me neiter
[6:04:59] Quecklain: and then kingdom hearts right?

[6:05:05] majkos: Tibia
[6:05:08] Saint473: @Preachlfw just so you know, swtor is more of a story game with mmo tacked on now.
[6:05:09] Mina_the_Engineer: if you want a blast from the past, play Tibia, hails from the late 90s, is one of the oldest MMOs still active
[6:05:11] GrebboGaming: Runescape is definitely it's own vibe but it vibes very well
[6:05:14] Rysiel: 11 will always hold a special place in my heart
[6:05:15] Sarpharon: the people who play runescape don't really want to either
[6:05:16] Spysocks: You'll live a long and happy life without it
[6:05:16] Zyheadra: that is a few years of gameplay
[6:05:19] Nupss: any Cabal Online enjoyers modCheck
[6:05:22] Rysiel: Chains of Promathia is top notch content
[6:05:25] Geri_0123: star trek online exists to sell ppl ships on the store
[6:05:29] Bohya_: RuneScape would be a fun experiment tho @preachlfw could make it work without the 8 years of grinding I'm sure
[6:05:31] Mina_the_Engineer: you wouldn't like runescape, it's very much not your kind of game
[6:05:43] biglonelytv: did you play SWTOR? @Preachlfw
[6:05:43] Protopets: after 1000 hours
[6:05:46] kierancantxox: star trek online story is pretty decent ill admitg
[6:05:46] Mina_the_Engineer: the core gameplay loop is grinding for tiny gains

[6:05:52] Geri_0123: there is a fairly new stargate tactical game
[6:05:55] alwiro: naaaaah, they would slaughter that IP
[6:05:56] Cas_final2: Stargate is the superior Star- property
[6:05:56] Miskav: I still re-watch stargate every year

[6:06:05] ilandra: STO has horrendous payment model. I always spend too much money there.
[6:06:06] BasVanDerWerff: recently watched the og stargate movie stil a banger
[6:06:07] GeordieMarauder: @preachlfw STO IS fine but very pay to win
[6:06:12] gbgrozev: there is only one good thing about the Ori and thats Morena Baccarin
[6:06:15] Miyu_Fhey: Stargate Universe had so much potential q.q
[6:06:28] Zendrell: We need a good Stargate game haha I'd love empire building too, establishing resource outposts, remote shipyards...
[6:06:36] Fluffy_Pillows: @Miyu_Fhey S3 has a script u can read online :)
[6:06:36] Selverya: we will never get a stargate game tbh, it's too late, unless they manage to revive it (I would love that tbh)
[6:06:51] kierancantxox: gib warhammer MMO
[6:06:51] neugassh: "dune mmo" wont be an mmorpg

[6:07:29] ka_gu_ra: @DeadRote Thanks for the gift sub!
[6:07:31] gimme_h: too many people involved with a big IP, creativity gets choked
[6:07:36] Madelion: I'm really hoping that Riot stick the landing with theirs
[6:07:38] Mina_the_Engineer: KEKW have any crit gear
[6:07:46] cythis_91: 'Please, sir, may I have a more crits?' 'MOOOOOOORE?'
[6:07:56] Bohya_: Did you keep up with the Warhammer lore / audiobooks in the end?
[6:08:01] Edrem: Stargate Timekeepers came out just last month, but it's not getting great reviews
[6:08:23] Miskav: Is it 50% bonus or 50% of your crit, added?
[6:08:24] Geri_0123: the stargate game reminds me of commandos from back in the day
[6:08:38] LightflashLP: Who is FAT CAT ? peepoChat
[6:08:40] cythis_91: Did not know there was a Dune MMO coming out, or is that the survival?

[6:08:53] kierancantxox: i just finished the horus heresy audio book, so good
[6:08:56] Unrealsiege: but Mike that would take time and care for the IPs and not bring quick monies :S
[6:08:56] Dreadzol: xdd
[6:08:58] Bohya_: Fair there's like 45 years of content KEKW
[6:09:00] Haximaxi: KEKW
[6:09:00] alwiro: AAAAA
[6:09:01] Mina_the_Engineer: best stargate game is a Minecraft mod, so that tells you how dire that IP is
[6:09:10] nohomu67: monkaS Might want to reinvest those talent points
[6:09:17] Mina_the_Engineer: peepoGiggles

[6:10:30] Saranodamnedh: catJAM catJAMMER
[6:10:33] henzo3: their making a hades 2????
[6:10:42] kierancantxox: not the biggest rogue lite fan but god i loved hades
[6:10:46] Bohya_: I've heard very positive things about hell divers
[6:10:48] Kattsallad: Helldivers = democracy simulator
[6:10:56] Miskav: @Mina_the_Engineer Oh cool, had no idea there was a standalone one
[6:10:56] Tyki_jp: co-op game 3rd person shooter, pretty fun
[6:10:57] zxabu230: Thought it was EA this eyar

[6:11:15] DozlaT: Outcast was kinda fun but the demo is short
[6:11:15] Miskav: 2025+
[6:11:19] SpectraBG: I believe it is inspired by starship troopers
[6:11:20] alwiro: 2025
[6:11:21] aftergl0w: Sure
[6:11:23] GrebboGaming: but it was probably like 3yrs ago
[6:11:27] kierancantxox: EA will be out first i believe
[6:11:27] aftergl0w: when cafe
[6:11:27] thetoolman22: starship troopers looks like starship troopers on crack

[6:13:13] Nahzdro: isaac looks like good game but i can't get over the art
[6:13:21] Allessii: I find binding of Issac disturbing and i have been on human autopsies
[6:13:25] Markreivi: Tigole Bitties ice cream Pog
[6:13:29] esparsit: Is the book unironic ?
[6:13:46] GrebboGaming: starship troopers feels like a satire is the book way different?
[6:13:48] Bohya_: That movie has remained in my top 5 for 20 years
[6:14:04] alwiro: it's fun to brick the game :D
[6:14:12] BasVanDerWerff: both are great
[6:14:12] Presea_Diamond: I made a thing on twitter for you jeathSmirk
[6:14:13] Markreivi: Demolition Man is BiS
[6:14:13] Vorgavar: Movie director missed the point of the book, the film is a good watch though.
[6:14:15] kaw_kaw: At least until you play Greed mode and super greed has armor
[6:14:17] Bohya_: Shower scene EZ
[6:14:21] Markreivi: IT DOES
[6:14:23] plznoplz1111: BOOBA
[6:14:27] Fenzha: If you can see anything under your tear effects youve not got a good enough build in Isaac
[6:14:29] ilandra: @preachlfw demolition man has boobs! in the missed call scene.
[6:14:30] kaw_kaw: Starship has a shower scene
[6:14:30] Markreivi: Demolition Man has the video call with booba

[6:14:36] cythis_91: Beeeeeewwwwwwwbssssssss!
[6:14:49] realnzall: Cheer100 Any advice on best games to enter the Soulslike genre with? I already own DS1 Remastered and know you suggest Elden Ring frequently because of the accessibility, but are there any games from other studios that are good entrance points?
[6:14:57] YuushaEX: RIP Flash
[6:15:02] shrimpssy: And spoon
[6:15:10] Fluffy_Pillows: pies of p MaxLOL
[6:15:12] Geri_0123: fallen order
[6:15:13] CubicleTrash: Mortal Shell
[6:15:13] Bohya_: Monster hunter
[6:15:16] Madelion: Lies of P is very good
[6:15:18] DozlaT: remnant is good if u like shooting
[6:15:26] Zeroslayer: NODDERS
[6:15:28] Bohya_: Toukiden
[6:15:32] YuushaEX: yeah Lies of P is good for noobies
[6:15:33] Traion: No other studio has quite been as good as the FromSoft games
[6:15:33] HickinR: salt and sanctuary is great
[6:15:34] turtleandfish: some people like me love nioh
[6:15:34] Mina_the_Engineer: Code Vein is pretty good if you have a high weeb tolerance, Lies of P is apparently very good
[6:15:35] cythis_91: Code Vein is pretty easy/good
[6:15:36] UnholyLP: Code vein
[6:15:37] Streamlabs: 🐲 Check out our new Dragonflight merch in metal band live tour style! https://preachgaming.com/shop/ 🐲
[6:15:41] MegaZirax: I like Nioh
[6:15:42] kierancantxox: i watched demolition man first time last month, and i watched the original total recall the other week i can see why they are classics
[6:15:42] Fluffy_Pillows: @YuushaEX WHIT? lol
[6:15:43] realnzall: @Preachlfw DArk Souls
[6:15:45] andavaar: I absolutely would play bloodborne if it was on the PC
[6:15:45] Bohya_: Fair question
[6:15:53] YuushaEX: also Sekiro's good
[6:15:53] penBaron: Hollow Knight?
[6:15:57] Ronny_Styles: I'd say Jedi Fallen Order would be a good idea if you're into Star Wars
[6:16:04] Zeroslayer: Demon's souls is usually abbreviated to DeS.
[6:16:06] idg4ff: man classic looks so slow without abilities like warrior leap, mounting, etc
[6:16:11] Bohya_: Scholar is glorious
[6:16:12] dragothicx: DS = Dark Souls DeS = Demon Souls
[6:16:12] bruv_oi: scholar sucks
[6:16:12] gimme_h: ds2 is my fav
[6:16:12] Traion: Sekiro is one of the best games ever made period
[6:16:16] Nupss: EZ my kinda guy. DS2 bis
[6:16:17] bruv_oi: too bloated
[6:16:17] alwiro: to get into it i would say DS2? it's a bit more palpatable
[6:16:18] elderratt: DS1 is the worst
[6:16:25] dragothicx: DS2 Enjoyers GIGACHAD
[6:16:30] BasVanDerWerff: mike did you know the cast only agreed to that shared shower scene if paul verhoeven also directed it naked (which he did)
[6:16:30] GrebboGaming: @idg4ff it is painfully slow compared to retail/other games lol
[6:16:33] Bohya_: I fucking adore scholars
[6:16:33] marla_hates: Demolition man sure, but what about Tank Girl?
[6:16:35] EunieXIV: Dark SOuls 2 was cool to get me into Souls but imo the others are better ^^
[6:16:36] YuushaEX: I mean Strangers of Paradise is probably a good shout
[6:16:37] Zeroslayer: @elderratt MADcat You what?!
[6:16:40] realnzall: @Preachlfw Opinions on Sekiro as an entry point? I think I may prefer a focus on parrying rather than dodging
[6:16:45] Sebbywebz: wat sebbyBilly
[6:16:46] Miskav: ew
[6:16:47] krvojex: @brackers89 ty for the gifted, just noticed <3

[6:16:49] P4rappa: same GIGACHAD
[6:16:49] elderratt: @Zeroslayer yes
[6:16:50] RubyStarbloom: DS2 is my fave, think it's carried by the world & general mood of the game
[6:16:51] Nupss: GIGACHAD based
[6:17:00] Zeroslayer: DS1 will forever be my favorite dark souls Bwop
[6:17:01] DukePiewalker: DS2 is only "bad" when compared internally to the other fromsoft games. Its still way better than most other games in general :)
[6:17:03] Mina_the_Engineer: Remnant from the Ashes and Remnant 2 is a shooter that's in the same style, both of them are very good; Nioh is a different style of gameplay but is also solid
[6:17:05] Traion: Sekiro is BiS
[6:17:07] idg4ff: @grebbogaming WoW slow life (isekai slow life remake)
[6:17:09] Bohya_: Toukiden if you want a more casual feel to it I guess?
[6:17:09] Geri_0123: have you played fallen order?
[6:17:11] Zeroslayer: Sekiro is my favorite from soft game so far.

[6:17:42] Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1: Bloodborne is my favorite followed by Sekiro
[6:17:49] cythis_91: We need a BB2 Sadge
[6:17:53] UniqeornRider: bloodborne is the reason I own ps4
[6:17:58] Zeroslayer: DeS remaster will get a PC version before bloodborne will happen.
