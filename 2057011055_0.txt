[0:59:59] ruffian0305: you were being carried harder :p
[1:00:00] Sleepyjoegaming: because you got boosted
[1:00:28] Tomalegendary: There is no Seasonal Affix anymore
[1:01:09] Lumimyrsky: I used to be really, really good, but as I've gotten older I just don't care about being the best anymore LUL
[1:01:18] bwoods79: that guy that broke the record didn't have any caffeine, drank water only. he was allowed to have a 5 minute break each hour for bathroom etc. He quoted "He said fatigue caused him to start hallucinating after about 45 hours of gaming."
[1:01:42] Harai_Ulfsark: im normally a pug only tank, this season the random guild im in wanted to push keys as a group, there's this death knight which got promoted to officer that is just horrible and needs to be hard carried even through 15s :(
[1:03:47] ruffian0305: not everyone is going to show up
[1:03:53] ruffian0305: I wouls yes
[1:03:58] Sleepyjoegaming: i think 20 tickets to sell is the idea
[1:04:06] ruffian0305: cause its free, nothing invested
[1:04:33] bwoods79: During his 60-hour gaming marathon, Mr Vujity-Zsolnay passed the time by clearing dungeons with his friends and battling other players.

[1:04:55] IAmScarlett__: i bought d4 ultimate edition

[1:04:58] a_demeaning_cow: a_demeaning_cow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:05:01] Vorryk: I think you just have to ask yourself if you make that call, and more than 150 show up, are you willing to go outside and say "sorry mate, thanks for coming but i can't let you in"
[1:05:05] Harai_Ulfsark: i would have listed the tickets at a symbolic prince since the start, so people could at least commit a bit more to showing up
[1:05:14] Layliah79: yes
[1:05:16] Layliah79: still free
[1:05:23] MachoCham: The real thing is that people can just buy Guinness Records, they're kinda worthless
[1:05:44] bwoods79: So do you have any guesses on the big surprise they are giving us with 10.2.6? no ptr is really surprising
[1:05:50] Harai_Ulfsark: price* :(
[1:05:58] Sleepyjoegaming: because its free i would say alot will drop
[1:06:12] bwoods79: player housing!
[1:06:15] MachoCham: We need to speak to the event people and see what they advise tbh
[1:06:15] Layliah79: i meant if people had to put a deposit on the tickets, then are more likely to show up. day of the event the deposit goes back to them so it's still a free event.
[1:06:47] Warcraftthor: Don't over subscribe just in case and invite special guests
[1:07:00] Layliah79: it's first event!! it can only go up from here :D
[1:07:01] MachoCham: Well that's why we have the bugger
[1:07:05] MachoCham: Or buffer

[2:40:30] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:40:42] Jack_the_Dipper: LUL
[2:40:49] Dunkurk: He's not wrong
[2:40:51] Jack_the_Dipper: He blew up with shhorts
[2:40:56] Arlaeya: but but but sometimes you have to soak so THERE
[2:40:57] S3N71: I beg to differ.  Raid Stormwind with 3 full raids of Undead, and experience the joy of unscripted mechanics.  PvE is like cooking, once you know the recipe, it's easy
[2:41:36] Dunkurk: Id say theres some truth to that
[2:41:56] Jack_the_Dipper: @MrGM you ever seen the WoW South Park episode?
[2:41:56] Dunkurk: Once a guild gets WF on the last boss, you dont really see them struggling with the fight the next wee even if theres no nerfs
[2:42:32] Jack_the_Dipper: Remember that bold chubby guy? That character is based of his dad @MrGM
[2:42:48] Jack_the_Dipper: yep
[2:42:58] Sleepyjoegaming: dingg
[2:43:25] Jack_the_Dipper: His daad was an art director at blizzard and worked on the WoW epsiode of South Parkarkk

[2:46:49] CloudyHS: ✨ discovery ✨
[2:47:03] MachoCham: I mean tbf that is discovery
[2:47:59] S3N71: @LaMu2560 Runes, what if exploration (Warlock Tanks etc), new events (dungeon to realigned to raid).  It's classic with a twist.  And it's nice :)
[2:49:04] LuiBMHunter: nah sida's bag was fairly quick for me anyway
[2:49:35] MachoCham: What happened to his short lived addiction again?
[2:50:14] neverbornlucky: MrGm serious wow question. What do you think about the idea that you take wow pet system add a quality to it and pets help you profession wise gathering and crafting like palworld
[2:50:52] MachoCham: Sounds like another Garrison table
[2:51:16] Big_Rum: Off to dinner my dude enjoy the rest of stream.. see ya in the morning

[2:52:51] Dunkurk: Average weather for those dates in may ar 23C
[2:52:53] MachoCham: 8c drizzle
[2:53:17] S3N71: We had had snow in April, poss May
[2:53:32] Dunkurk: Theres also more than 2 scottish people in attendance so that guarantees a downpour
[2:53:33] MachoCham: Statistically more likely to have a white easter than a white christmas
[2:53:35] fooxytv: snow for me today
[2:53:42] S3N71: Always snow up North ;-)
[2:54:09] S3N71: Surface flooding in my part of Essex

[2:59:06] MachoCham: I can't wait for your awkward speech because you hate being center of attention IRL
[2:59:13] S3N71: Eye of the Tiger ;-)
[2:59:14] fooxytv: is there a reserve list?
[2:59:17] Jack_the_Dipper: Eye of the Tiger Kappa

[3:05:32] MachoCham: Might have gone Blizzcon
[3:05:44] S3N71: That's very much the vibe.  Most of my guild are in mainland Europe (Horde A guild), UK and Europe (EU guild establishedm 2006), not sure about Horde C guild (PCG (PC Gamer guild)) and Horde D guild (Infinity Challenge, Wochi's epic boys n gals)
[3:05:46] TheFortLowestoft: omg LUL
[3:06:15] TomCat: when people say stuff like that without checking (and it's so easy to check) remind me of every 3rd grader ever
[3:06:45] MachoCham: They don't care about facts

[3:55:58] CrowMomocle: Yes New England has much of England's flavour
[3:56:10] Goblocker: East Coast was the 13 Colonies and Spanish Florida
[3:56:12] JakeSezz: East Coast is more sarcastic and blunt and a little more like Europe, yeah, it’s the oldest. But, West Coast is the best coast, imo
[3:56:31] CrowMomocle: Boston is haphazzardly layed out but further west all cities are in blocks

[4:13:02] Jack_the_Dipper: @MrGM yes 100%
[4:13:30] Akela3: than ever? no. but it's accelerating right now for sure
[4:13:45] Greatmatt1: From the Wright brothers to landing on the moon was only 66 years.
[4:13:52] Jack_the_Dipper: Your grandfater did not had anything close at the same age you are now
[4:13:58] neverbornlucky: in 25 years we will not be typing with keyboards or mouse to play wow3.0
[4:14:17] Jack_the_Dipper: TV is only 60 years old
[4:14:38] Akela3: can't stop it no. we just have to hope it develops responsible and right now that's pretty much in question
[4:14:59] RAF_Sean: Oh shit late night Dan stream!?
[4:15:15] Dunkurk: To be fair to the wright brothers to the moon tho its comign up on 60 years since the moon landing and we still arnt passed the moon

[4:17:03] Dunkurk: The artemis mission keeps getting pushed back tho
[4:17:03] Jack_the_Dipper: I think handwriting will be useless to learn in school soon
[4:17:04] neverbornlucky: if spacex stops exploding their starships we will get to the moon
[4:17:13] CrowMomocle: We should have had a moonbase years ago
[4:17:25] Dunkurk: If your intersested i recommend looking into the Artemis program, the goal is a moon orbital space station to launch onwards to mars
