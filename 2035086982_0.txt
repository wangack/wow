[0:44:45] StreamElements: Click on this link to subscribe to my channel -> subs.twitch.tv/psherotv
[0:44:46] SavageLoaf: Twitch has a serious problem with promoting leftism brainwash
[0:44:46] markaimfire_: That's s  korea. It profits them BILLIONS a year. Twitch is going nowhere
[0:44:56] bomzzwtf: or maybe not the whole company but my department at least
[0:45:00] YourHomieAJ: But Why Korea?
[0:45:05] iam_sebastien: What would you do that day ?
[0:45:10] watermel0n92: that means the way twitch operates right now isnt profitable, doesnt mean it cant be profitable in general
[0:45:29] markaimfire_: Advertisements are always profitable
[0:45:36] markaimfire_: It's a machine
[0:45:42] Bo3_TV: Okey, but do you have plans on staying in sweden you should learn swedish
[0:45:48] Gogis79: youtube,x, twitch, all of them not making money
[0:45:53] bigrick896: you can see in amazon's disclosures that it's not profitable lol
[0:46:04] exstas1234: im pretty sure youtube makes a profit

[0:47:58] miroslavisikiyski: the irl stream yesterday was quite fun btw
[0:48:01] razoraus: @markaimfire_ you have no idea.  go look at UBER and netflix LUL
[0:48:10] bigrick896: plenty of companies are loss making for 20 + years before making a profit lol
[0:48:22] Bo3_TV: @bomzzwtf True but if i moved to another country i would try asap to learn there lang
[0:48:27] exstas1234: google is biggest company in world no way they are in debt
[0:48:28] bomzzwtf: @Bo3_TV you do you
[0:48:31] tetenqt: google google Pepega
[0:48:33] Bo3_TV: Its good its sweden cuz we know english but
[0:48:37] aspex89: google debt - Total debt on the balance sheet as of September 2023 : $26.33 B
[0:48:40] markaimfire_: We will talk in 10 years when twitch is still running
[0:48:47] Phnx1337: city of angels smoke and mirror expansion Pog
[0:48:48] Farenheight451: also amazon being able to report a loss on taxes is big in the us to save money
[0:48:52] markaimfire_: I love you and the stream regardless
[0:48:53] razoraus: @markaimfire_ that doesn't change anything hahah
[0:49:09] markaimfire_: You are expressing concern over twitch folding
[0:49:13] trayan666: dude chill out
[0:49:15] Gogis79: I thought it was super common knowledge that most tech companies operate on a loss. Guess I was wrong
[0:49:33] Bo3_TV: @bomzzwtf where are you from originally
[0:49:44] markaimfire_: I see what you mean
[0:49:54] bomzzwtf: ireland
[0:49:59] RajuBePrime: Some people don't understand profit/revenue/ debt lol
[0:50:02] Bo3_TV: cool :)
[0:50:13] lnstinctgx: now the next question, how much debt does Amazon have?
[0:50:30] unicron_unicorn: Why dont u play dragonflight?
[0:50:36] tetenqt: @PsheroTV what if the person becomes a famous painter like bob ross?
[0:50:40] PutridFart: PutridFart subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:50:54] razoraus: companies dont operate at a loss.... "It's taken 14 years and nearly $32 billion of cumulative losses, but ride-sharing and food delivery company Uber (UBER 0.71%) is finally a profitable company."
[0:50:55] aspex89: i spy ROOT on the top shelf there
[0:51:23] kritss: ye, but what if he doesn t become a painter? we all know what will happen Kappa
[0:51:28] aspex89: oh nice
[0:51:39] saghaesp: @unicron_unicorn sod better wow
[0:51:50] markaimfire_: Does uber operate under another company?
[0:51:58] razoraus: no
[0:52:01] markaimfire_: Twitch is a pawn in amazons process
[0:52:08] markaimfire_: There is no comparison
[0:52:12] So__z: what did you think about ripost build for pvp?
[0:52:46] So__z: thanks you for your answer :)
[0:52:59] razoraus: there will be a point where Amazon may want to cut it loses it certain divisions... and the ones that are operating at aloss are a obvious target.  Its not rocket science

[3:39:14] elessar_jk2: According to a recent study conducted by the British University and their Department for Online Roleplaying (2023), it was concluded that the rogue players' weapon choice (daggers or swords) often coincided with the players' genitalia size. Interestingly enough, these results correlate with a previous study in which it was concluded that female players more frequently chose rogue players wielding swords as their male partners.

[6:47:21] snugglefistsgaming: @dudas2 I'm not a hunter tho. Rogues are the 1v1 best class in the game, the hope most classes have is to try to kite which was already hard due to sprint and blind now they can ranged slow. They patched the only weakness in their design. I just go bear form and duke it out but its still not a good idea to give it to rogues.
[6:47:23] Valsu: and there it is
