[2:59:56] Veriance: It's always death near the altars
[3:00:07] Veriance: So you cant stay near them to keep turning in
[3:00:23] Dynamics831: for example you wont lose as much blood at 50 as you would if you had 200+
[3:00:30] Dynamics831: thats why you want to turn in at 50
[3:00:55] Elijahss: the main reason you are not always turning in, is bc you need to also be killing people together, and it takes time to turn in

[8:02:54] kenzellbtw: doesn’t remove existing stacks
[8:03:05] Koshintu: ads xdd
[8:03:12] vosa5: Because warbringer removes movement impairing, but its not worth it to change the runes I guess
[8:03:15] IamWarbringer: Because Warbringer is the best skill :>

[8:13:19] lwkind9: Homunc is in the same class as sunder it's an immediate 5 stack.
[8:13:19] BossardW: devasate deals damage as if 5 stacks of sunder were applied to a target when it has a stronger armor redcution effect @Koshintu. meaing it still benefits even more from additional threat because of the damage it is doing
[8:13:30] ZevisAu: I am well, I rested a lot today, been selling things in my house as im moving in 2 months back into a house share, too expensive to live alone rn.
