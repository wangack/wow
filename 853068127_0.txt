Seriously if you ask me how i dodge certain attacks i can only give general pointers like dodge backwards on most of midirs attack or dodge into the sword in first phase of gael. but thats about it and you need to experience it anywa

Seriously if you ask me how i dodge certain attacks i can only give general pointers like dodge backwards on most of midirs attack or dodge into the sword in first phase of gael. but thats about it and you need to experience it anywa
