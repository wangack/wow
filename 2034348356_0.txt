[0:11:28] zaazzaa: i am wrong or your Ui gets bigger and more symbols ?
[0:11:54] streetfultv: @Soulaxer yeah thats why i bought one xd but so hard to get used to xd
[0:12:18] ayosteviey: @StreetfuI Its so nice idk how id play without it
[0:12:47] aod0311x: That was dirty lmao
[0:12:54] maybethistimepls: why cant u just do dmg while they use their own stun? whys it gotta be yours
[0:12:59] maybethistimepls: you use less globals re stunning
[0:13:06] streetfultv: @ayosteviey i havent played with one forever and binds are akward thats why i bought it so binds can be less akward
[0:13:31] ayosteviey: My last naga broke Ive been using the corsair version its pretty sweet
[0:13:39] sahowl_al: hi to my fav streamer
[0:14:17] streetfultv: @ayosteviey nice, have you always used a naga/scimitar?
[0:14:23] Soulaxer: The crazy thing is idk if Whaazz even uses a naga
[0:14:32] ayosteviey: Yeah started wow in WoD and always had a naga
[0:15:12] Soulaxer: A good amount of R1s dont have a naga makes no sense to me

[0:15:12] ayosteviey: You're biggest issue might be the screen shakes spamming mouse buttons lololol
[0:15:17] blkylol: ive tried getting used to a naga  I just cant I wish I could
[0:15:23] streetfultv: damn i need to get keybinds down fast for my musclememory so i can play optimal again
[0:15:34] ayosteviey: Somne ppl played before they came out i guess so theyre just used to it
[0:15:51] streetfultv: true
[0:16:15] blkylol: main thing i dont understand on the naga it feels like the buttons are too close and I am going to press multiple trying to press one lol
[0:16:23] ayosteviey: Ik pika uses one and he gets flamed for it but whatever works for you
[0:16:43] kevingoldenboy: holy fuck that pre duel
[0:16:53] deno65: fuck yeah your calls , everygody needs a whaaz as shotcaller
[0:16:55] Soulaxer: I still feel like most wow players use a naga or some form of it
[0:16:57] kevingoldenboy: was a play straight from AWC
[0:17:05] streetfultv: Yeah right now my issue is remembering while under pressure what button is what xd
[0:17:12] soothingmistmonk: How is EU up and US isnt?
[0:17:15] zaazzaa: @Soulaxer bc of the extra buttons ?
[0:17:15] Soulaxer: They dont make nagas like they used to tho I swear theyre not as durable
[0:17:19] kevingoldenboy: it also helps that thesis is one of the best mages
[0:17:31] ayosteviey: @Soulaxer 100%
[0:17:46] ayosteviey: They changed the buttons too. The OG naga was the best
[0:17:58] Soulaxer: @zaazzaa yes it adds 12+ buttons that can all be accessed by your thumb when normally your thumb does nothing

[0:24:24] azliaris1: where there'
[0:24:28] azliaris1: there's less coordination
