[1:37:42] darkznz: yea they need to just get us to 60 then do everything after that
[1:37:44] Sleepysevenz: need level 60 in sod for fun
[1:37:46] PsyonicPanda: I do it for the 1v1s in WPVP and the BGs should be fun since you can't queue into full stacks anymore
[1:37:48] serverfirst300003: bunch of gear for pvp in blood moon event but i agree its not really apealing
[1:37:50] PsyonicPanda: level 25 was wack though
[1:37:51] gladwannabe: do you take poison totems against all rogue comps?
[1:37:58] dotnrot88: no what happned to the epic staff or sword that drops is it going to have to be farmed out every time you want it at a certain lvl?

[1:38:50] PsyonicPanda: level 25 SOD is definitely giga wack
[1:39:00] PsyonicPanda: 40 might be better, I'm excited for WPVP at 60 tbh
[1:39:04] dotnrot88: @mezard45 yo check this out so preist next phase get 2 runes one is pain suppression and other is somthign else but anyways the poitn is both runes that give you the abilitys you get them anyways downt he tree at 40 or you get base line one of them at 60
[1:39:04] ledpredatorx: retail way more wack imo
[1:39:12] laha1n: i think ill have a ton of fun at 60, not until then
[1:39:14] dotnrot88: whats ht point in the runes if you get them late anyways
[1:39:18] PsyonicPanda: @ledpredatorx Naw, I'm a Classic andy and level 25 was fucking horrible
[1:39:23] ledpredatorx: true
[1:39:27] laha1n: why would i want to play without 90% of my toolkit and 3 new abilities
[1:39:40] PsyonicPanda: There isn't enough counterplay in PvP at 25
[1:39:45] PsyonicPanda: You don't have any abilities
[1:39:54] ledpredatorx: lvl 40 stv will be fun for a bit tho
[1:40:01] PsyonicPanda: 40 might be good yeah

[1:54:26] PsyonicPanda: @moldybread00 I'm just thinking like if they were playing Rogue/Boomkin instead, would the damage still be so high?
[1:54:41] pitskees: hoj - rep - fear is a nasty chain
[1:55:00] moldybread00: Theyre unleashing gos and theyre sitting in it, so theyre surviving it long enough to play that aggro- gotta get them out of unleash shield @cdewx
[1:55:03] goonbear96: there is more blood dks 1800 than aug evokers this season in 3s cdew
[1:55:41] cogswolds: are druid grove guardians tankier than totems? Feels like totems are paper

[2:00:08] What_ln_Tarnation: @goonbear96 why?
[2:00:16] PsyonicPanda: I wonder if it would help to burrow earlier to get it on CD.
[2:00:18] felgazer: I have a question, knowing melee cleaves are bad rn why are you guys playing it?
[2:00:24] TrippyvV: The question was about about getting combat early, vs dh dk its irrelevant
[2:00:34] Kennobai: @Cybernytez they're just d oing DPS rotation and training a stationary target, no skill or brain involved
[2:00:36] goonbear96: veeving is believing
[2:01:07] Cybernytez: @Kennobai  rofl ^^

[2:01:18] RealXrave: now you get to press verdant :D
[2:01:29] What_ln_Tarnation: @goonbear96 did you know S2 of DF is the only season in the HISTORY of all of wow that aug had more 1800+s then bdk?
[2:01:51] TheEyeVII: @Kennobai only difference with caster cleave is they don't have to move at all TwitchConHYPE  40 yards, boi
[2:02:01] Kennobai: @Cybernytez it's unlivable even if he had precog, DH and DK will not kill anything faster than the ret and surv will kill the sham
[2:02:02] goonbear96: @What_ln_Tarnation do you not see a problem with that
[2:02:15] What_ln_Tarnation: @goonbear96 wdym
[2:02:39] goonbear96: @What_ln_Tarnation do you not see a problem with a tank class being higher rated than a dps support class
[2:02:45] TheEyeVII: @What_ln_Tarnation "history of wow" aug came out when again? LUL
[2:02:53] Cybernytez: i played DH/DK on my Hpal yesterday and won every game but it was low cr ^^
[2:02:53] RealXrave: aug didnt exist before then kEkW
[2:02:53] Kennobai: @TheEyeVII most castercleaves are not as oppressive as something that can just run down your healer and you can't do a thing about it
[2:02:57] What_ln_Tarnation: @TheEyeVII this guy got the joke

[2:04:03] shredder1111: no precog sounds like torture
[2:04:09] TheEyeVII: @Kennobai ya it's way worse you gotta be an afk turret instead blasting the entire map
[2:04:24] pitskees: @PaladeusTV he has alot more keybinds theyre just hidden
[2:04:46] PaladeusTV: I wonder what keybinds hes using forTarget party 1/2/3 macros
[2:04:51] moldybread00: rshams high masterty but squishy build is good for rogue x for control reasons but in a slug out fight rsham will feel stressful @cdewx
[2:05:07] PsyonicPanda: @PaladeusTV He has a video on his channel on "how to be a better healer" and it goes over all of his binds and stuff like that
[2:05:14] dinglecx: he uses function keys 123 I think @PaladeusTV
[2:05:30] PaladeusTV: Thanks guys
[2:05:34] moldybread00: cdew uses party 123 macros which i find the easiest to use on my mouse idk
[2:05:56] Qdubbz: is scroll wheel up/down for party 1&2 bad u think
