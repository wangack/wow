[1:03:09] proratexe: I can‚Äôt believe Tarkov is still beta
[1:03:10] calkappa: This games still in "beta" right? Thats probably why its not on steam

[2:01:23] Kingkaz00: its helps if your good at gaming but Personality is soo much more important to be successful in this streaming industry. Luckily Shroud has both..... noice
[2:01:28] Lokomuerte: Civ and Stellaris are the kind of game you start and then look at the clock and it is 4am. Time just flies playing them
[2:01:29] mangohelpmewithmyhw: One more turn...

[2:02:13] smackdaddy69: and dayz
[2:02:13] devilzragee: scav runs are op tho
[2:02:15] Ch1oe_6758: What's the effective range of the shot guns in this game?
[2:02:18] Tweker: you can literally main scav
[2:02:19] LichSaw: @yohanbernardo for survive mode there is some unoficial servers
[2:02:22] detestedmink: Civ is an all time great game franchise
[2:02:23] BluelightCT: load up 2 accounts KEKW
[2:02:25] OptionalGames: agreed
[2:02:25] 901ish: YEP
[2:02:29] DeathDeclined: h1z1 should have stayed on the survival aspect of there game instead of changing it
[2:02:30] c_a_c_o_: 100%
[2:02:30] SpringTail: so true
[2:02:32] JeanKazameR: RIP TARKOV
[2:02:33] KontrolStyle: YEP
[2:02:42] operation1001: @shroud  why i think scav raids should be random map no picking the map
[2:02:45] ItzMeCodyy: @OptionalGames i meant just waiting to play it, but 100% youre right get it while its cheaper
[2:02:57] olivsthewizard: do you like any game lets be honest
[2:02:59] kappapapaaa: yeah would be cool if you could do challenges and shit on either pmc or scav cause i prefer scav as well lol
[2:03:01] Dresden71: when it becomes continous with no raids timers, pmc will be so fun
[2:03:02] JeanKazameR: Just the fact that you can KNOW SPAWNS ruins the immersion
[2:03:03] SynystarTV: Thats why I like the way The Cycle just drops you into an ever going thing
[2:03:03] xzBlink: Easy fix make spawns random places
[2:03:05] c_a_c_o_: raids should be like in The cycle
[2:03:08] devilzragee: what level is your pmc mike?
[2:03:10] AtrixGames: scav life DLC will be immense, if it ever happens
[2:03:11] lNimmyl: better spawns is a huge thing that needs to be addressed
[2:03:11] AtOmIc_HoK: I like scav runs way more only thing I don't like is going against a juiced PMC
[2:03:11] Hennvssy: would you suggest a server that stays open like the cycle?
[2:03:13] proratexe: If you had no downtime for scavs, everyone would main scav and not use their PMC and the game wouldn‚Äôt be fun
[2:03:16] JeebieBeebies: 100%
[2:03:22] 901ish: what is shroud's scav karma chat?
[2:03:27] operation1001: @shroud  or maybne a cool down opn maps
[2:03:27] hoonigan603: That would be dope unless ur pc cant run the map KEKW
[2:03:29] nameless___: make raids like the cycle does ez fix
[2:03:32] 901ish: 5Head
[2:03:36] hefty_joe: indeed
[2:03:36] Bigdmaz: god damn ad jumpscares
[2:03:37] taewooer: what lvl is ur scav
[2:03:38] zimaa_blue: do you like the spaw system of cycle better?
[2:03:39] daspaz: or shorter scav CD
[2:03:40] GamingLegendHimself: @Pseudo_Logic u wanna play sometime im lvl 12 and i dont have someone to play it with :(
[2:03:41] desertfoxx1911: but the rpg mechanics for PMC isnt bad
[2:03:44] Authenthiq: how do you check scav karma ?
[2:03:44] Wheelson105: spawns as pmc's shouldnt be in set locations, should be random + 150-200m spawn distance from next
[2:03:44] 901ish: nice
[2:03:51] EliteSerial: Good times getting Killa to follow your Scav around. LUL
[2:03:52] StreamElements: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[2:03:55] lNimmyl: just make tarkov the cycle easy clap
[2:03:57] Luaden: That actually seems like a really good change. Full random for better loot seems like an awesome gamble.
[2:04:00] MrPassTheBong: make raids like the cycle does..... that'd be disgusting. no thanks.
[2:04:02] AtOmIc_HoK: @nameless___ tarkov servers would literally catch fire if there was 6 hour raid timers
[2:04:04] DarthFunkNinja: What if with really high scav rep; you could spawn in the beginning of the raid
[2:04:05] proratexe: @shroud what‚Äôs your PMC k/d
[2:04:07] oyToke: @Authenthiq fence rep
[2:04:10] devilzragee: theres no reason you should spawn in on a pmc and die within the first 30 seconds of a raid
[2:04:10] HayaPlays: i hit 6 scav karma today. having all extracts now is awesome for so many maps
[2:04:14] daz2z: @shroud did you ever play They Are Billions?
[2:04:14] Neutronguardian: hey shroud whats ur fps now ? @shroud

[2:04:26] operation1001: @shroud  just cause everyone scav runs there main money making map should be more random
[2:04:31] BluelightCT: technical limits interesting

[2:04:48] Tweker: @proratexe with the fence rep and the hideout upgrade you can get a 4 min scav cooldown, aka long enough to store your stuff around/sell stuff
[2:04:56] gojiburr: is the cycle dead?

[2:05:15] tabrexs: LUL
[2:05:16] AtOmIc_HoK: I wish cheaters didn't fully kill the cycle they said they're not doing anymore wipes

[2:05:37] twitchchatdemon: what theres no more wipes ?
[2:05:37] Soarlozer: how different is the show from the game lmao
[2:05:38] SynystarTV: No wipes is HUUUUGE
[2:05:38] proratexe: @siv_ay more than midncommon
[2:05:41] twitchchatdemon: oh nvm
[2:05:43] BluelightCT: thats YUGE
[2:05:43] Ch1oe_6758: Wait, The Cycle finally stopped wiping?
[2:05:52] Wheelson105: dmz is now wiping and people arent happy
[2:05:55] Myuri_: the best innovation and creativity thrive in restraints
[2:05:55] Kynato: Are you playing Dark and darker when it's back out?
[2:05:56] ryaann__: what's the actual active playerbase on tarkov ?
[2:05:57] proratexe: @grahamlennon you will love it
[2:06:00] liam3gg: how do i get fps to show on screen chat?
[2:06:06] darl1ck: i am thinking of going to back to cycle , is it worth @shroud  are you going to play again?
[2:06:06] Ch1oe_6758: That's massive for me. The wiping is one of the biggest reason I didn't play it after a while.
[2:06:06] 901ish: D&D will have wipes
[2:06:06] SynystarTV: @BluelightCT YUUUUGE
[2:06:12] gojiburr: when is the last cycle wipe?
[2:06:12] Gaming_After_Dark: how long does it take to wipe? i want to get into the game
[2:06:13] DarthFunkNinja: I honestly think Dark and Darker is gonna be huge; next playtest is on feb 6th
[2:06:18] proratexe: @kontrolstyle it‚Äôs so good, you‚Äôll love it
[2:06:21] add1ct3dd: i just never had the same adrenaline feeling with cycle compared to tarkov - the futuristic weapons and maps are harder to be immersed in
[2:06:23] gojiburr: sounds way better tbh

[2:06:35] JPT00: poe wipe every 3 months still a Pog game
[2:06:36] RyanLikesDessert: I think Tarkov wipes are tolerated due to it being unique
[2:06:37] mourtzoudis536: Dayz has Servers wipe on Community
[2:06:37] AtOmIc_HoK: but wipes are what keep the game interesting. once you finish all the quests there's only so much PvP you're gonna wanna do before wanting to play something else
[2:06:41] nethsaa: !dpi
[2:06:41] StreamElements: @nethsaa, Mike uses 400 DPI

[2:07:07] elnn_val: Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[2:07:12] illuwe: Rust wipes were the OG
[2:07:14] SynystarTV: They definitely learn and act really fast, props to Yager fr
[2:07:17] Aloomiii: D:
[2:07:18] crimsonkking: üñï Stare
[2:07:18] Samuraiz: but then how is it gonig to work with out wipes, for gigga nerds to get hella kited all the time, and people that play on a more casual basis are going to get fucked @shroud
[2:07:26] Kickstand_: what map is this?
[2:07:30] Gaming_After_Dark: ty
[2:07:31] RatsMonthlyCoffeeSupply: the cycle will not be wiping from season 3 and after that @shroud

[2:07:47] Rohnan: true
[2:07:48] Aloomiii: yep
[2:07:52] Ch1oe_6758: @AtOmIc_HoK I guess it depends from person to person. I personally did not like the wipes at all because the idea of tons of progress being ripped from you through no fault of your own didn't sit right with me.
[2:07:52] CROSliffer: fast to learn, hard to master.
[2:07:53] Bigdmaz: @Skadooshhhh totally agree - as a new player there's so much going on. I'm probably 10-20 hours in and feel like i barely have the basics
[2:07:54] Kickstand_: TY @tomiery and @KontrolStyle
[2:07:54] Daigus: shroudY
[2:07:54] machriphi: @Samuraiz It goes both ways because it also lets the casuals jump back in and be equal footing with the "giga nerds"
[2:07:57] Giftless: Lol I kinda had that moment today actually
[2:08:00] Skadooshhhh: but then it takes another 100 hours for the next map
[2:08:00] yohanbernardo: i cant play this game because i get scared as fuck, i cant get out of a corner
[2:08:01] PuNkY27: not for ppl with bad pc's xD
[2:08:02] ermaltopalli: YEP
[2:08:04] StalkerMonolith: I have over 1K hours, still hasnt clicked with me KEKW
[2:08:05] misterbeeaans: Your back on Tarkov how!!!
[2:08:05] Dannylarr: this is the only game i have gear fear on, i don't know why its so severe specifically for tarkov aha
[2:08:06] kappapapaaa: a lot to learn for sure
[2:08:07] thebutcher12481: there is another med bag in the back corner behind the curtain
[2:08:08] DankinWithJesus: @liam3gg yea you hit ` on ur keyborad in game
[2:08:08] YesItsDominator: click my head eyes
[2:08:11] EdgeLordofGourd: is there still no kill cam
[2:08:11] Poeti: YEAHBUT7TV
[2:08:11] DeeZhuL: its about learning the mechanics cuz most know how to aim and shoot
[2:08:12] DeathDeclined: was alot like learning dayz for me
[2:08:14] CMDR: learning maps the hard part
[2:08:17] dako99: getting it only took 20 hours for overwatch but still silver :)
[2:08:17] ProfPartyPants: now does the 100 hrs include loading time KEKW
[2:08:19] The_Fury141: This game seems like a paranoia simulator
[2:08:19] SergeitZ: The learning process before it clicks is fun though
[2:08:21] OptionalGames: man dayz takes at least 100 hrs as well lol
[2:08:22] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[2:08:24] TheVannysher_TV: i dont understand the game but i m still enjoying watching you playing it somehow. XD
[2:08:26] BluelightCT: Loot bucket system
[2:08:30] Raketool: LUL
[2:08:30] daspaz: @yohanbernardo try listening to music and just running around. removing sound from yourself kinda removes some of that fear
[2:08:30] Udgaardsloke: So 200 hours for humans and 100 for you @shroud
[2:08:35] neveroom_: Matchmaking in Cycle just doesnt work LUL
[2:08:35] papidamian: papidamian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 16 months of rowdiness of the shroud kind!
[2:08:40] VYAITHN: I like wipes tbh
[2:08:43] katurian17: this game keeps crashing for me  on Woods so I can't do the first mission
[2:08:46] Liimatti: @OptionalGames yeah I was thinking about that too lol
[2:08:49] Skadooshhhh: @Bigdmaz i played for around 30-49 hours and i still didnt know shit and just followed through youtube for quests
[2:08:52] StreamElements: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[2:08:52] Samuraiz: right okay that makes more sense
[2:08:52] oimojooi: Scav city
[2:08:53] JPT00: one small step for scav
[2:08:56] Under_Growth: At the same time, Seasonal wipes can give games like the cycle longevity, it's why it works so well for PoE
[2:08:58] AfroChang: lol
[2:09:01] SparkleTheatre: theres a stash at the end of this area in a tire in the back corner along fence/street side
[2:09:02] KontrolStyle: @Udgaardsloke, yeah he learns fast as fuck
[2:09:04] rubwieez: wait why are u not killing each other right now?
[2:09:05] Amiray: he jumped over and theres a hole 2 feet to his left lmao
[2:09:06] AtOmIc_HoK: wipes keep the game interesting and make you want to come back. if tarkov hasn't wiped you wouldn't even be playing it right now
[2:09:08] oakboak: @neveroom_  matchmaking in cycle doednt work because there are no players lmaooo
[2:09:15] 2twofaced: @rubwieez scav
[2:09:19] neveroom_: @oakboak Indeed.
[2:09:20] imvhirtue: @shroud they changed it to KD for lobbies its not based on extract value now
[2:09:21] Samuraiz: when does S3 come out anyone know ?
[2:09:29] WrecklessMH: are wipes kinda like poe leagues?
[2:09:29] rubwieez: okok
[2:09:33] Raketool: SUBprise
[2:09:35] 1wilsonn: wipes are good for games
[2:09:36] devilzragee: i wish they just removed the scav cooldown timer from intel center and added it to normal scav timer from the start.
[2:09:38] DeeZhuL: the updates make you comeback
[2:09:39] Tweker: its the changes LUL
[2:09:39] Myuri_: @under_growth, tbh POE has nothing going on for it other than wipes
[2:09:41] EdgeLordofGourd: it's sad when they wipe players. I had a character on day z alive from launch day til first wipe. I was completely kitted out
[2:09:41] RatsMonthlyCoffeeSupply: in a little longer than a month @Samuraiz
[2:09:42] devilzragee: the new recoil changes are pretty good
[2:09:42] JPT00: new content after 6 months of waiting YEP
[2:09:44] CROSliffer: restore of balance gets us back to it
[2:09:45] 901ish: wipes are to attract new people
[2:09:46] m3rda_: @1wilsonn depends on the game
[2:09:49] devilzragee: new map is pretty cool
[2:09:49] Nacedos: its the sense of progression + new content
[2:09:50] tekstyleso: new content is what makes people come back
[2:09:50] mathew_x: wipes just bring new content. I would gladly not quest again for the 7th time
[2:09:52] oldtop: That‚Äôs why I come back
[2:09:54] theeninjaof: unoptimized "content"
[2:09:55] mayank_roy9: starting from 0 to 50 feels good
[2:09:55] cloudrhythm: wipes are the only reason I return to these games, content doesnt matter much to me
[2:09:55] flying_dutchmanz: economy inflates after a while. you need a wipe to balance it out.
[2:09:56] Drunkndragon: something about starting from 0 with everybody just is fun
[2:09:58] Jkist7: True, because if they wiped and nothing changed, many would not return
[2:10:00] SparkleTheatre: learning new things
[2:10:01] Wheelson105: i like start > mid wipe, i come back start of wipe,
[2:10:03] Dannylarr: im not sure i like the continuous lobbys in the cycle, i prefer the session based raids of tarkov
[2:10:12] Jkist7: in fact, people would just be mad if they wiped without changing anything
[2:10:12] Tweker: NODDERS
[2:10:13] EdgeLordofGourd: it's sad when they wipe players. I had a character on day z alive from launch day til first wipe. I was completely kitted out
[2:10:17] dripzz6: it is
[2:10:18] RatsMonthlyCoffeeSupply: so how do u feel about the cycle not wiping from s3 onwards @shroud
[2:10:20] ParasiteEve37: fresh start is enough for me
[2:10:21] n0rmel: the wipe attracts but isnt the reason you stay @shroud
[2:10:22] GalaxyKebap: True
[2:10:22] TheVannysher_TV: ppl dont wanna come back if it just for doing all the same content.
[2:10:25] lodinn: hundred percent this game dies when the wipes stop
[2:10:28] elementofprgress: last wipe was a good example of that
[2:10:28] devilzragee: i feel like once tarkov full releases if they keep it stagnant and only wipe itll die in a year
[2:10:28] flamingshadowgr: its like a refreshed game
[2:10:30] plvy3oi: Wipe gets tiring after awhile
[2:10:31] JerfOnTheClerf: Are the wipes random or do they give a decent heads up
[2:10:31] danewy7: !commands
[2:10:32] StreamElements: @danewy7, You can find a list of all Commands here https://streamelements.com/shroud/commands
[2:10:32] kepahe: The changes makes me not wanna come back to be honest
[2:10:34] m3rda_: @RatsMonthlyCoffeeSupply he already said he liked it and is going back
[2:10:37] Real_Blastz: True
[2:10:39] Samuraiz: so do you think they will ever wipe? @shroud or people who play alot always going to have good gear/guns
[2:10:41] misterbeeaans: Wish I had a teammate like shroud üëÄ
[2:10:43] Novacq: The upgrading process can be more enjoyable when more people are on the same level
[2:10:45] SynystarTV: They added a new map and armor pack a punch
[2:10:46] aggttv: quest update brought my friends and I back
[2:10:48] Joey1k30: I miss the old cycle where it was a battle royal
[2:10:48] JPT00: i skipped last wipe
[2:10:48] Worldyo: v rising dlc later on this year, have any interest in that
[2:10:51] RatsMonthlyCoffeeSupply: @m3rda_ oh thanks i just joined stream so i didnt hear it
[2:10:57] xxnitsua: What you think of that new game The Day Before
[2:11:00] illuwe: @devilzragee ain't no way Tarkov is ever getting a full release lol
[2:11:01] b0rjetv: The feeling of not being 100 years behind. Like starting playing a wow exapnsion last patch before next expansion, not fun
[2:11:01] TheGreatAnsim: cycle wont be wiping anymore either so its fully dead
[2:11:01] zeb8mhanznonsonoio: NonbinaryPride
[2:11:02] BluelightCT: that happened to tarkov recently with the lighthouse expansion and the factory expansion
[2:11:04] JeebieBeebies: Less pf a fresh start would prob be better. Keep discoveries, skills, something so you start with some progress

[2:13:22] AtOmIc_HoK: I feel like BSG intended streets to be a scav map
