[1:48:13] Putcride: what about the faze clan?
[1:48:18] Sollice: Splits kinda killed things
[1:48:20] firewalltwitch: maybe help sell sponsors idk
[1:48:39] Peqdevil: I assume its mostly PR
[1:48:44] Sollice: He also said his players are paid no matter what the viewership is down
[1:48:54] mavericks312: im suprised liquid lets max stream on his channel during the race tbh
[1:48:54] Funderik: they tried over production it i think  they had so much hardware and staff. there might be a point in the next couple races liquid drop limit

[1:49:20] CMack_72: It's all about the FOMO
[1:49:30] Leemann9: @Towelliee Do you know if u have to get a certain rep or finish all the quests in order to get all the world quests? I still have not got that rock climbing quest show up.
[1:49:40] Funderik: echo is main channel, their personal don't do anywhere near the numbers

[1:50:23] Funderik: @OmgItsEdizzle well he does, cus he owns the echo main channel aswell lol
[1:50:41] Leemann9: @scoped71 ty for the info.
[1:50:45] Aegllor: @scoped71 6 i believe
[1:50:50] OnyxLair77: Why has Liquid been in a slump? What piece, role, and player etc do you think they need?
[1:50:51] largefromage: rip
[1:51:02] Leemann9: ty ty
[1:51:14] LB_MadMonk: its good to see u on the featured section of twitch! <3
[1:51:14] Masqerader: 26k or so
[1:51:25] Vesidian: Towelliee, have you ever competed @ that level?
[1:51:35] Nerendis: The Liquid stream is pretty meh compared to Echo
[1:51:38] zysmos: echo's casters owned this tier
[1:51:40] Funderik: they were the most view twitch channel period
[1:51:42] cahoots82: Echo's production > Liquid's production honestly
[1:51:44] Holysal: the reason why is bc how they started when they had coms and method didnt
[1:51:47] verentnarv: liquid just keeps losing on all ends
[1:51:54] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @pingafest (warning)
[1:51:55] Funderik: echo production and cast made it amazing.
[1:51:59] dSaipher: Question for chat, if i'm saved to m0 1: can i complete quests in the dungeon and 2: can other people trade me gear?
[1:51:59] OmgItsEdizzle: liquid just didn't have anywhere near the casting talent
[1:52:03] DangerZoneJunky: Didn't echo have rich? rip

[1:52:16] Sollice: No lol Rich has goone in to hiding
[1:52:20] RayenFlores: a wizard
[1:52:27] Nerendis: I got kinda tired of Preach towards the end tbh
[1:52:27] ThorH13: @pingafest !ui
[1:52:34] mavericks312: the problem is liquids likes bring on old liquid players/org mates
[1:52:44] Heero_Effect: @dangerzonejunky yeah but I guess he is a creeper. Not shocking
[1:52:45] Funderik: not sure
[1:52:49] PrimalRain: some of both
[1:52:54] Funderik: assume both.
[1:53:24] ThorH13: !ui
[1:53:25] Moobot: @ThorH13 Retail UI: https://bit.ly/3CmeUsJ | Towelliee's Plater Addon Profile - https://wago.io/1ZozQnKxj | We use Luxthos's WeakAuras Luxthos.com Leveling Weak Aura wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar | Everything can be found at towelliee.com/wowdf
[1:53:35] Funderik: divive that by raid team, outside raid support too, it gets split like 25-30 times.
[1:53:37] MakaiiART: jeath was explaining like you'd hear in an analyst video 3 days later, on the spot live. it really is crazy lol
[1:53:56] Funderik: 30
[1:53:58] Rottencoarse: 40?
[1:53:58] Funderik: at least
[1:54:00] Kisswani: 28 ?
[1:54:02] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  40
[1:54:02] PrimalRain: yeah then it's all split by like 35 people with the analysts and everything
[1:54:02] cahoots82: 30
[1:54:07] comp1: 30
[1:54:10] Funderik: weak aura guys, aswell
[1:54:12] cahoots82: 28 players + analyst
[1:54:14] cahoots82: so maybe 40
[1:54:25] firewalltwitch: the ad rev is that low? didnt u make 65kish from Lost Ark (guess there horus lower)
[1:54:32] Holysal: liquid pays them a salary too
[1:54:37] firewalltwitch: hours*
[1:54:44] Funderik: fair high ball number
[1:55:04] firewalltwitch: mhmm
[1:55:17] mavericks312: how do you think these orgs stay wealthy lol
[1:55:22] Nerendis: Honestly? As someone who has follow Liquid for over a decade. I don't believe they are truly "IN" to WoW yet
[1:55:22] Moobot: Towelliee is rocking the new Logitech Sona Mic! Check it out at https://imp.i125364.net/Yg5neP Click on Blue and check out the Sona Mic !!
[1:55:28] firewalltwitch: Mcdonalds pays better Kappa
[1:55:29] Funderik: because liquid is a fanchise with many teams, they want profit.
[1:55:39] Nerendis: Liquid messaging on WoW is 120% different than League or other games
[1:55:55] Sarocus: comes down to about minimum wage, given the hours spent on the race
[1:55:56] Moobot: DROPS ARE DONE! But watch any RWF Stream https://www.wowhead.com/news/perpetual-purple-firework-twitch-drop-from-race-to-world-first-streamers-330359 for your Purple Fireworks Toy! REMEMBER TO LINK YOUR BATTLE.NET AND TWITCH - https://account.battle.net/connections
[1:55:58] firewalltwitch: but where is the profit to pay them
[1:56:03] mavericks312: i can tell you right now trill aint making what he is worth
[1:56:03] Heero_Effect: Watching high level WoW players is kinda boring though. Most of them don‚Äôt have personalities
[1:56:06] eyeztea: if they get to keep all money they will focus on making money and their stream instead of playing best
[1:56:10] Nerendis: Trill should be getting paid 1.5m a year?
[1:56:11] verentnarv: i think that's why echo is better for a wow team, everything stays in the team
[1:56:11] smashwow: knowing your worth and getting it are also 2 different things
[1:56:14] Funderik: it's also a 5-7 month wait between events too which probably stings their pay alot.
[1:56:19] firewalltwitch: Faker gets way higher viewership (tv deals in korea)
[1:56:20] BestoftheWurst: Blizzard need to take over RWF.
[1:56:34] cahoots82: w

[1:56:49] letrickyxd: world wide idol basically LUL
[1:56:51] Heero_Effect: @bestofthewurst they did that with Starcraft and killed it
[1:56:54] Rottencoarse: yeah it's a bad example XD
[1:56:56] gelimarr: GeT_Right
[1:56:57] CMack_72: As an Esports virtual manager, I'd like to see the metrics to support that statement.
[1:56:57] PrimalRain: BestoftheWurst LUL nah, rip owl
[1:56:57] firewalltwitch: lol
[1:57:01] Holysal: @BestoftheWurst no they dont
[1:57:03] Funderik: @BestoftheWurst they don't and won't.
[1:57:06] Nerendis: Just FYI most League pros make $150k base
[1:57:08] gelimarr: Olofmeister
[1:57:11] pbnj_kills: esports orgs just arent profitable so they try to only give the bare minimum sadly
[1:57:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  shroud maybe?
[1:57:15] Rottencoarse: or tim?
[1:57:44] MosesPoe: it's all still fairly new, give it a decade, e sports gamers are gonna be getting bank rolled like the NFL I betcha lol

[4:06:17] biirrd: Thunder sucks
[4:06:19] Syrixx: theres no way inspired could be a thing with the amount of casts that need cc'ing / kicking
[4:06:29] Dox023: I like mythic+ affixes that don‚Äôt make you have to drastically change your routes all the time.
