[0:40:24] cyrej: leveling in darkshore is rough, too much traveling
[0:40:27] taggishv2: have u ever been to sweden
[0:40:29] moonglazzer: power below is not quest you need to do.. its a quest that drops rarely
[0:40:32] miuul: also popular in Luxembourg (very very small country)
[0:40:39] Solmund123: That quest they cc you and run away so watch it
[0:40:49] Sivain: @swifty question.. if your doing HC and don't group but be in same zone helping one another.. is that ok?
[0:41:18] BigDaddyEth: anyone have any advice on classic wow? i find it very overwhelming and hard to follow questlines etc...
[0:41:25] Wash_hc: you cant help one another
[0:41:31] back2r00ts: only if u dont ask for it
[0:41:42] Wash_hc: maybe 1-2 mobs, but if youre doing more, youre basically cheating, if they catch you
[0:41:55] moonglazzer: XD
[0:42:03] threeec: What server are all the HC players playing on? Or does it not matter ?
[0:42:23] Sivain: I mean more along the lines you two go around together just never grouped so don't share the xp
[0:42:29] threeec: This is acutally a really cool idea
[0:42:29] scottiesy: Talents
[0:42:49] threeec: I use to love wow got burnt out on it. But I'm really liking this hc idea
[0:42:53] hyparionwow: Any chance you are going to try and push gladiator again on retail in the near future?

[0:46:45] cyrej: sprit tap and wands is really strong solo
[0:46:53] Daddecool: Spirit Tap is def in the wand leveling build IIRC
[0:47:06] kirbz09: spirit tap + wand spec is the meta to start
[0:48:09] NoNice_f: this server dont have pvp right ?
[0:49:10] moonglazzer: max is 10% only
[0:49:27] Capnrein: I'm so proud that you are alive still
[0:49:42] drcrcj: blackout doesn't work on ticks, only the initial cast
[0:49:47] OGSceneBoy: Nice 15 so far
[0:50:15] OGSceneBoy: Blackout is pog for the change of stun
[0:50:24] OGSceneBoy: but its rare
[0:50:38] OGSceneBoy: True yeah
[0:50:46] Daddecool: Spirit Tap does become a lot better once you slightly ramp up your pulling speed once mobs out damage shields and you are casting more SW:P and PW:S more often.  That plus if you take any hits between shields, saves the need for a Renew after.
[0:50:58] OGSceneBoy: I think going improved sheild is def smart
[0:51:05] OGSceneBoy: Smart move

[4:36:46] Neumonyx: blizz HC server = BAD idea. Why? Think it through. On HC runs there are griefers. There is also a appeal method, which is fast and looked at by real life people. Compare that to what blizz would do

[4:40:04] karlkani666: So, did you consider about that idea I gave you last time? Dragonflight Burst video?
[4:40:13] Seanio7: Yeah and they only push bosses they know for sure they can take down
[4:41:23] JESTER_XP: In hardcore  mode do you still have to delete your character if you die at max lv?

[4:46:54] grimian1991: Why not do 100 pushups?
[4:46:57] Digmadness: :D
[4:47:08] nickylas: yeaa man, i was in road to rag stuff was stressful
[4:47:22] profxjojo: bush wacked
[4:47:27] Neumonyx: ya, I was the same. Thought no way Imma die, played forever... then, you lose focus for one sec, and dead
[4:47:36] Kuretake: lol, I was wondering why I got gifted a sub by  @Swifty DendiFace
[4:47:38] Topg_338: Gift number of subs as the level you died
[4:47:39] grimian1991: I think bushwhacked is like being ganged by npcs
[4:48:10] EliBourne: suddenly attacked by a lot of higher level toons
[4:48:11] grimian1991: I suggest just doing a pushup challenge
[4:48:31] collin_bo_ballin: i was in a trio running RFC and we were at the first boss and i guess i stepped back too far and aggroed like 6 mobs down below. we died WutFace

[4:51:24] lunatik710: what about the toons weve worked so hard on? :(
[4:51:26] xtannerplays: i have a 16 gnome mage on this realm. name is Ballfro
[4:51:31] Ufrisk: 50dollars for you to go die?
[4:51:51] Capnrein: they should make a normal one and a pvp one

[4:52:42] coconust1: 300 IQ
[4:52:49] wolftwenty: they could make a HC server that has pvp as optional and one that is fully pvp and add a criminal aspect to the game
[4:52:56] Kinz174: fade is for when you have aggro, no ?

[4:53:39] PaEu: if they did a hardcore pvp server and made it so you could loot people you kill, would be so fun
[4:53:55] noenken: The Classic team has always been a lot more responsive to community ideas.
[4:54:09] SpidercowSD: @Swifty Based on the Popularity of HC in Diablo Games I can see why
[4:54:30] SpidercowSD: Has to be Classic only tho. Way to much going on in high dlcs
[4:54:49] willys_pinballpub: i think it would be cool if you just loot dead bodies of other people. That would encourage no helping
[4:55:06] coconust1: R
[4:55:28] coconust1: Leveling was only meaningful and rewarding in Vanilla tho

[5:27:56] noenken: MMO on top end graphics doesn't work. Never will.
[5:27:57] Swantee: yya
[5:28:04] Fillmore420: 1 of4 haha
[5:28:22] LordSamus: More ads plz
[5:28:26] Capnrein: it just doesnt show any unique features or showcase what the game is about
[5:28:29] nikkenixon: @noenken true
[5:28:31] WowGrl: That would be sweet
[5:28:39] WowGrl: Wow in Unreal Engine
[5:28:41] imm00rtalx: @Swifty Riot MMO will be good
[5:28:43] fizrukh: Rendered trailer, without a gameplay. Anyone can do trailer like these haha
[5:28:55] sincityspy: I think BLIZZARD need to go this rout with World of WARRAFT! to stay relevant
[5:29:12] fragge1337: i just want riot mmo
[5:29:18] Oriion_: Cloth strength FTW
[5:29:21] imm00rtalx: yh i mean blizzard prob will eventually, well get wow 2 somehow

[5:29:25] sincityspy: I owuld

[5:29:35] back2r00ts: do it more mats for tayloring
[5:29:37] Airwaive: LUL
[5:29:42] imm00rtalx: they rather try and make wow 2 than completely die and lose all revenue
[5:29:45] bojimbo: id stay on top of professions yeah
[5:29:46] modaandachamp: those mages on that hit like a dump truck
[5:29:48] fizrukh: Blizzard doesn't do engine 5 for a reason. People can't afford 3k pcâs
[5:29:58] raivven933: loch modan now

[5:30:11] Airwaive: gonna be end game when you head to the Defias camp
[5:30:17] LordSamus: @fizrukh Truth
[5:30:28] myStylez: They also said valorant was the csgo killer Kappa
[5:30:34] FrozakenDk: @fizrukh The whole point of using unreal engine is that they go away from the heavily CPU based rendering pipeline
[5:30:41] wolftwenty: if the game is correctly optimized it will run on for the majority every pc
[5:30:44] FrozakenDk: It would most likely run a lot better
[5:30:45] nikkenixon: but what is a game without shadows???
[5:30:52] imm00rtalx: yh i mean the best graphics card like 6 years ago, is prob the cheapest one now
[5:30:59] Stealthygank: i do feel riots mmo will dominate wow for the main fact they have ghost crawler 1 and 2 all of riots game are usually solid
[5:31:04] Crystalforge: my PC cant play sons of the foest :'(
[5:31:07] icarus19861: dlss is a gamechanger .
[5:31:13] fizrukh: Blizzard knows for good optimization. And wow running smoothly on most of pc
[5:31:25] DumbledorSoD: ghost crawler already left or got fired
[5:31:27] FrozakenDk: Ghost crawler just resigned from riot
[5:31:30] Faultin: nah if blizzard was in trouble they would of changed it by now...
[5:31:33] DumbledorSoD: saw a article about it the other day
[5:31:35] Oriion_: I tried to play Shadowlands without shadows, did work well. Story made no sense @Swifty
[5:31:38] CommanderQuacks: ghost crawler actaully just stepped down
[5:31:52] imm00rtalx: @Swifty Its basically League of legends universe, same way warcraft transsisioned into WoW
[5:32:10] imm00rtalx: no
[5:32:12] WowGrl: Overwatch
[5:32:16] dowjy: thats concept art
[5:32:17] ArukuGaming: No thats just spash art
[5:32:19] nikkenixon: turn off shadows now and embrace the flattnes
[5:32:25] whymypissbchunky: i think its just concept art
[5:32:26] imm00rtalx: not the graphics they have an artsytle for concept art
[5:32:29] neugassh: there is 0 info about it
[5:32:29] noenken: @Stealthygank well, that fell apart quickly. xD
[5:32:34] HERESIA__: Riot moi will not work
[5:32:38] HERESIA__: Mmo
[5:32:49] MoistyBlizz: it looks like wow graphics tbh lol my brother works at Riot " i work at blizzard" so we get to talk about whats coming out and such lol
[5:32:54] DumbledorSoD: Im assuming it will be cartoony because league of legends is and also there anime Arcane show is the same kind of art work, also similar to valorant
[5:33:07] modaandachamp: hope he chnaged hearth
[5:33:20] HERESIA__: It will be as toxic as lol currently is
[5:33:22] imm00rtalx: if someone is gonna do it its gonna be riot, until microsoft buys activision WoW prob wont do anything revolutionary
[5:33:34] Netflyerr: These zones are the nicest in wow! They bring back memories!
[5:33:41] dowjy: Swifty might know more than he's giving off ;D
[5:33:52] EliBourne: man i hated walking then i hated riding then i hated flying now we have dragon flight and i want regular flying back
[5:33:53] Stealthygank: ***
[5:34:00] Kuretake: I feel like any MMo from these companies right now would be too woke-crafty for my taste
[5:34:14] DumbledorSoD: swifty you gonna play diablo 4?
[5:34:39] Stealthygank: @noenken what did
[5:34:44] noenken: The one thing I would like about microsoft buying ActiBlizz would be possibly WoW on Xbox, maybe even on Gamepass.
[5:35:05] noenken: the ghostcrawler comment.
[5:35:14] imm00rtalx: No one thought Game of Thrones was gonna be arguebly the best series of all time, but just because it did stuff that others wouldnt it is, the issue most of these companies face is trying to be morally right in what they do. No killing, nothing that could be seen as offence
[5:35:17] raivven933: cape

[5:36:34] fetfgut: why do u lvl tailoring
[5:36:34] Stealthygank: Street previously said, âAnyone that knows me from my WoW developer days would know that I love dungeons and raids as a player.â  The upcoming MMO has several great bosses to draw on already too, including Baron Nashor, Elder Drake, Krugs, Gromp, and any of the 162 champs in League.
[5:36:41] fetfgut: isn't it better to lvl engi or alchi ?
[5:36:50] profxjojo: LETS GOOOOOO
[5:36:58] profxjojo: /hugz

[5:38:42] noenken: and then whool bags
[5:39:13] Kuretake: @imm00rtalx They start like that. But the more they engage with the fans, the more they get influenced by the expectation of the  crowd. The concept of "thinking outseide the box"  just doesn't live long enough.
[5:39:52] imm00rtalx: i mean its a good starting point
[5:40:24] imm00rtalx: Pax Dei?
