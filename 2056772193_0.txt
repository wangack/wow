[1:42:27] SamuraiWillZ916: it detected them they got emails
[1:42:35] king_julian_96: thank fuck
[1:42:39] MajorDumpsterFire: ^
[1:42:45] king_julian_96: gdkp is a plague to the game
[1:43:03] Slitze: yeah sending gold from one of your accounts to the other can issue a warning
[1:43:05] Slitze: we're fucked
[1:43:18] Armdel: how is the classic wow subreddit fairing
[1:43:21] chewytowel: omg it's happening
[1:43:32] jhopps12: thats why we run master loot and kick people who complain about it LUL
[1:43:51] Basedjugger: and what is the problem?
[1:43:52] force_FMD: congrats on the transmog card
[1:43:56] king_julian_96: so you think peopel wil lstill gold buy
[1:44:16] MajorDumpsterFire: @king_julian_96 Absolutely they will
[1:44:20] king_julian_96: you think people will still buy gold toweliee
[1:44:31] Wulfgrym: gold buying isn't going to get affected one bit with gkdp bans LUL
[1:44:45] TheUnknowing: people will always buy gold
[1:44:45] itsamochatree: More people will have to take that risk.
[1:44:46] Lightasaurus: Boosts aren't bought with gold??
[1:45:18] Amarlian: I still find the only time WOW "Solved" Gold buying is with the token. I am not suggesting it but it was the only time it really reduced @Towelliee
[1:45:50] tr4ncetv: Got Legendary Mephisto this morning. Probably the only good thing out of the box. Another box waiting when the bois get time to rip this week
[1:45:51] Basedjugger: but didn't they also say they have a new system for detecting bots etc. which should drive down gold sellers/buyers? sounds like a pronged approach imo but I agree on your point too

[1:46:30] king_julian_96: nothing
[1:46:34] Wulfgrym: its not doing a damn thing
[1:46:34] tr1ckshot22: trying to remove a sink for the gold bought, so its less likely?
[1:46:35] Lightasaurus: What reason do people have to buy gold in such quantities without GDKP?
[1:46:35] king_julian_96: they are'nt fixing anything
[1:46:43] Xara36: it amplifies it faster, speeds up the inflation
[1:46:45] Lulaboo: guys what time do the servers restart in acific time?
[1:46:45] Armdel: less gdkp runs and more normal runs maybe...?
[1:46:47] Jdb60: They said in an interview that they understand the GKDP ban isn't a solution to gold buying, but it gets rid of an obfuscation for gold buying and a way for buyers to launder their gold. It's a step in the direction, not a solution
[1:46:50] Lulaboo: pacific*
[1:46:51] Wulfgrym: like 99.9% of the stuff classic clowns whine about.
[1:46:54] Znza: gold prices halved so nothing lol they are making it worse
[1:46:57] Lightasaurus: People buy boosts with real money, not gold. counter intuitive to the chinese business model
[1:46:59] MightyCactus1: I dont think this will fix RMT either, but at least they are trying new things to combat it. That is kind of what SoD is for
[1:47:07] ClassicMalcontent: Honestly think they were getting a lot of complaints about people reporting Chat messages with GDKP messages.
[1:47:08] Wulfgrym: p2 live 1pm PST
[1:47:17] paulson14: they will figure it out
[1:47:19] paulson14: lol
[1:47:20] ClassicMalcontent: And just reacted to the complaints about GDKP spam
[1:47:21] MajorDumpsterFire: @Lulaboo 4 est so 1 pm pacific i think
[1:47:44] Lulaboo: im asking because I forgot to do love rocket attmpts yesterday
[1:47:46] thmpr324: I can’t wait to catch a stray ban after trading out potions in raid

[2:26:36] Wulfgrym: lol
[2:26:36] MightyCactus1: I like the idea of a lot of the larger dungeons being raids, but in reality it is nice that the below 60 raids are short enough to do in 30-45 mins

[2:58:52] dinguskong_: what toon are you leveling when p2 comes out?
[2:58:58] Wulfgrym: @elactix2gg yeah
[2:59:09] AzedaNA: You know they had a demon hunter on the OG Classic box and shit right. Wouldn't it be cool if in the last phase they added Demon Hunter to SOD? LUL
[2:59:24] Boats_NW: legs are easier to get than the ring for sure
[2:59:37] LavaVaYn3: so i have found a cool method for runes
[2:59:45] stepchild5876: 40
[2:59:48] Bloodhaven08: was 60 is now 40
[3:00:01] stepchild5876: rune
[3:00:05] LavaVaYn3: you wanna get dupe items of your gear for certain runes to use for macro combos in battle rotationals!
[3:00:06] COMMEdesRATS: yes
[3:00:16] XshadowturkeyX: they changed mut from 60 to 40? thats so nice
[3:00:41] stepchild5876: cant use it with out 2 daggers
[3:00:48] ooblahtv: i use mutilate with daggers open world pvp and i delete cloth alliance lol
[3:00:54] LavaVaYn3: yea but you can get another piece of gear and use that rune in the other and macro it in to gear swap
[3:01:06] stepchild5876: idk
[3:01:20] stepchild5876: id assume cus of the combo points
[3:01:22] Pups_Gersky: Mutilate is a both hand strike attack
[3:01:27] stepchild5876: you get 2 per mult
[3:02:17] BigbadKevin: says its soulbound?
[3:02:45] LavaVaYn3: idk what rogue runes are
[3:02:46] XshadowturkeyX: i think so
[3:02:49] Pups_Gersky: Maybe still just pots?
[3:02:54] LavaVaYn3: but i know warrior did get some sweet rage runes
[3:02:56] brewgamingtv: yeah
[3:02:59] Wulfgrym: @elactix2gg im only have blizz cards from epacks, because im in canada and shipping is expensive or takes over a month, im trying comc first, then if something doesn't sell, ill ship everything in on bulk shipment and start up my sales on ebay myself from there.
[3:03:23] LavaVaYn3: yea i cant wait
[3:03:33] LavaVaYn3: plus you get to utilize rage potions to
[3:03:40] LavaVaYn3: warriors gonna be busted

[3:04:44] XshadowturkeyX: 2 runes for helm datamined that help with energy regen for rogues
[3:05:05] LavaVaYn3: uhm i dont think thats something you want to talk about on stream famo!!!!
[3:05:18] Treevinal: Dream Team Punch and Tigers Blood
[3:05:23] LavaVaYn3: Im just sayin some asshole hater might go to ebay now and flap thier dick beaters
[3:05:27] 40locos: you take the risk that you win your own card
[3:05:37] Zuhbuumafu: I'm still locked in on the mango jalapeno.
[3:05:57] Wulfgrym: if you win, you don't pay for it, your account gets banned from buying off comc
[3:06:10] LavaVaYn3: but you can just cancel the order on yourself right? then no complaint wouldnt befiled on unshipped item
[3:06:21] LavaVaYn3: cause it was your account then thats where you get himmed up
[3:06:59] LavaVaYn3: just dont get in trouble love you to much to see some foul ass shit on the interwebs about my boy
[3:07:15] dracullus: 2028: Blizzard put 6 patches on PTR so we don't know which one is correct
[3:07:30] BigbadKevin: will they change phase 1 runes to be easier to get
[3:07:36] BigbadKevin: or should i go get them now
[3:07:50] expbottles: good morning towel. Mania press conference tonight!!!
[3:07:53] 91Niki: How much are those Chris Evans autos going for? I can't imagine they are too bad seeing he often does comic cons, so his auto isn't that hard to come by
[3:08:07] LavaVaYn3: they got alot of data mine capturing going on in ptr they are making bank off of it
[3:08:26] dracullus: yeah you think but it isn't working so good in Diablo 4, isn't it
[3:08:27] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:08:31] PanoramicPanda: would require a more through qa team
[3:09:08] expbottles: u ever thought about opening a card store??
[3:09:16] Vile_: Yeah, if the MS acquisition gives them a bigger QA/oversight team then sure, I'd be fine with removal of PTR.
[3:09:25] 91Niki: Right. I was just comparing it to like Harrison Fords auto, cuz he barely signs anything, so that means the auto value pushes the price of that card up tii
[3:09:27] 91Niki: too *
[3:09:35] LavaVaYn3: oh man a christopher rush signed pokemon mewtwo is so rare and expinsive cause he only did like one artwork in pokemon
[3:09:44] Arch4ik: how do they verify that the auto is genuine and not ripped from another signed item? Im not familair with collector items and the like
[3:09:52] Vile_: It's a catch-22. No PTR is good for mystery, good for the content feeling "fresh," but also without the PTR, certain things would've never been caught.
[3:09:57] LavaVaYn3: thats the same guy that did the black lotus in MTG
[3:10:10] BeeboBiggins: What do you think the 10.2.6 pirate patch is?
[3:10:19] AzedaNA: I mean QA for a game like WoW is likely just automated you don't need a huge team for that
[3:10:33] 91Niki: @Arch4ik Some cards are signed directly, but I think most uses like a sticker or something they insert on the card afterwards. So said person gets a page with X amount of things to sign, and they just cut it out and put it on the card

[3:10:42] Verdell263: @Towelliee You see the FTC is going to push more to revert the acquistion after the layoffs? FTC is pissed that Microsoft lied about no layoffs
[3:10:45] Velarn435: Expansion of the boat micro holiday?
[3:11:02] devildriver1919: pirate brawlers guild if you lose you walk the plank and have a 5 minute anchor the bottom of the sea
[3:11:12] AzedaNA: They're not reverting shit
[3:11:22] AzedaNA: They will get some campaign donations and it will go away
[3:11:26] LavaVaYn3: bro Im thinking they are going to make SOD merge for a greater story line in the future and IM for it!
[3:11:33] 91Niki: @Arch4ik Same works for some book signings or similar. Some is directly on the item, some are stickers or similar that then get inserted afterwards. It's so they don't have to ship the item to the person who is signing.
[3:11:35] s7wede: I'm thinking it's going to be very much like the opening of the gates of AQ. It's going to be a joint venture between SOD and retail with unique rewards for both
[3:11:43] Vile_: @LavaVaYn3 lmao they're not going to merge SOD and retail
[3:11:48] SamuraiWillZ916: the most they can do is give them a fine
[3:11:53] LavaVaYn3: i love what blizzards doing with the game to keep it fresh
[3:12:00] Arch4ik: @91Niki that makes sense.
[3:12:09] LavaVaYn3: @Vile_ they would most def do a story line merg
[3:12:17] Verdell263: Yeah, I get their frustration, but how you gonna revert 69 billion and all the changes? Rehire everyone? Bring back Bobby?
[3:12:18] LavaVaYn3: its very possible
[3:12:33] Vile_: @LavaVaYn3 I'll believe it if I see it.
[3:12:53] AzedaNA: They wouldn't revert. They would break them up, but that won't happen either
[3:12:59] LavaVaYn3: well they goit  that microsoft money backing them now
[3:13:22] AzedaNA: I don't think we have had a corporation broken up since like Bell telephones back before I was fucking born
[3:13:47] LavaVaYn3: you make a good point
[3:13:47] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:13:50] Jokervenom1978: ALL mergers result in layoffs.
[3:13:53] SamuraiWillZ916: was att part of bell?
[3:13:54] loragheta: i mean we all knew there would be layoffs after the merger. it happens with literally every single merger ever
[3:14:10] Bowwjack: @Towelliee nah they just want more companies to put money in their pockets
[3:14:15] paulson14: Always.
[3:14:31] 91Niki: I think people are clinging too much to the "we won't be messing with Blizzard" statement they made at first. That statement was referring to that they wouldn't mess with the ranks and control content completely. Not whether or not people would be laid off
[3:14:34] zBonezyy: Is their an addon for extra zoom?
[3:14:35] LavaVaYn3: dot the is and cross the ts
[3:14:39] ackdogg007: Blizzard Esports has been dead for years so put a shit load of resources and money into it
[3:14:45] Vile_: Corporations acting in good faith KEKW
[3:14:53] LavaVaYn3: @zBonezyy its a cmd line
[3:14:58] ackdogg007: Why put i ment
[3:15:02] AzedaNA: I have never worked for a company that was acquired where they didn't have huge layoffs after
[3:15:12] force_FMD: Hi, I just woke up yesterday under a rock
[3:15:18] s7wede: There is always redundancy after a merger so jobs will always be cut. Typically it's the middle management that gets hit hardest
[3:15:26] zBonezyy: @LavaVaYn3 I would like to obtain this cmd line
[3:15:32] AzedaNA: Like if your company ever gets acquired, polish your resume up ASAP

[3:15:58] Arch4ik: The OTK makgora tourney was the best wow esports is so long lol
[3:16:00] im_capy: A corporate company's only allegiance is to money, full-stop
[3:16:06] LavaVaYn3: max zoom comand
[3:16:09] 91Niki: I think the overall worst part of this is the fear it is putting into current AAA studio devs. Nobody feels safe with the amount of layoffs lately
[3:16:31] 91Niki: You can't work at your best if you are constantly worried about being the next line of layoffs

[3:17:02] drewetling: stelth walkin tours
[3:17:16] Verdell263: It's funny to me that anyone believe MIcrosoft's words about no layoffs. The same way that they'll keep COD on Playstation after the 10 year agreement
[3:17:36] AzedaNA: Anybody who knows anything knew layoffs were coming
[3:17:55] 91Niki: @Verdell263 Did they ever really say "No laysoffs" tho? I remember them saying they wouldn't "interfere" with Blizzard business which people confused.
[3:17:57] justhelping79: towSellout
[3:18:16] LavaVaYn3: they are taking cooking classes
[3:18:20] AzedaNA: FTC is incredibly underfunded. John Steward did a thing on it a while back.
[3:18:26] LavaVaYn3: thats what they was doing
[3:18:29] im_capy: has any company ever been bought out and hired more? I thought layoffs were common sense
[3:18:51] Verdell263: @91Niki They exact wording was something about keep ABK as a separate silo and not laying off positions that overlap between MS and ABK
[3:18:55] AzedaNA: @im_capy Typically they buy, layoff, then rehire what is necessary often at a lower salary
[3:19:02] CeruleanStar: WARN  has specific criteria that they can skirt

[3:19:14] Verdell263: Which is exactly what MS said the layoffs were for last week
[3:19:25] Morfiendxx: duplicate
[3:19:31] taasdaddy: You no longer need 2 HR departments for example
[3:19:36] taasdaddy: Or 2 IT depts ect
[3:19:38] Shamwise: The title or positions already existed at MS
[3:19:40] Morfiendxx: now that you have 20 people instead of 10 doing the same thing
[3:19:50] Arch4ik: dont these kind of layoffs happen every year around this time? It Q4 isnt it? Companies want to pad their books showing "Hey we have X number of employees with X amount of revenue. Investors invest!"
[3:19:53] im_capy: @AzedaNA Covid saw far too many overhires, I dont think the rehiring part will come true this time. Especially with Ai doing the simple tasks
[3:19:56] 91Niki: @Verdell263 Right. I think the majority of the layoffs was scrapped projects to focus on other things, as well as positions that they want to spend less on, customer service being AI focused with overseas backup, rather than paying more for what they already had
[3:20:15] ninetynil: irabu had about 7 good innings for NYY
[3:20:24] AzedaNA: Shareholders love layoffs
[3:20:31] force_FMD: i forgot about irabu
[3:20:41] 91Niki: Yeah over hiring during covid didn't help either
[3:20:45] LavaVaYn3: the yankies was my dads fav team
[3:21:22] Verdell263: @91Niki Yup. But the problem the FTC has is the layoffs that were for redundancy, which was what they said they wouldn't. I'm not arguing for the FTC. They're idiots if they believed they weren't going to streamline the business
[3:21:27] AzedaNA: Why do you think it took so long to get a new GTA or Skyrim? Why make something new when the other stuff prints

[3:21:32] 91Niki: The survival game devs were either laid off or moved onto other projects. And a lot of the other layoffs was costumer service people who is being replaced by cheaper alternative + AI
[3:21:37] im_capy: They need to make another movie or a show
[3:21:39] PanoramicPanda: give me Warcraft 4 that's an RTS that summarizes the WoW story beats as maps
[3:21:45] Arch4ik: they have enough money for those risks. if one of those risks pay off BIG then they profit even more. Kind of a no brainer for them to try
[3:21:47] 91Niki: @Verdell263 Yeah for sure
[3:21:48] dracullus: oof, I don't envy guy who will reveal OV3, unless it will have some massive changes
[3:22:11] LavaVaYn3: look vat csgo
[3:22:19] Brodih_: with Anniversary editions, Collector editions
[3:22:24] AzedaNA: Corporations don't like risk
[3:22:51] SpilledMelk: It's getting old. Same stuff rehashed yearly
[3:23:07] AzedaNA: Hollywood is the same story. They don't want to take risk on new IP so they rehash for sure winners
[3:23:08] reggiepowa: must have been pretty mid game if they made that call so quickly
[3:23:15] im_capy: Look how many studios are popping up over the last few years. Its never been easier to start a game project
[3:23:38] 91Niki: The fucked up part about that, is they can't really show off that project on their portfolio for future jobs. Because it is un published. It is X amount of years working on that project, down the drain
[3:23:56] RuFFyLyx: imagine players have the same standards for quality gaming in blizzard as in other studios, they would not make a dime with their current state of the games
[3:23:57] valianya: Wasn't the even a playable version of the Survival Game that Ybarra said he played a bit in the office?
[3:24:04] AzedaNA: angel investments
[3:24:07] batmern_: sod p2 hype
[3:24:20] penandsword49: ugh,, finding these last three race/class combos for fistful of love is annoying.
[3:24:28] im_capy: venture capitalists
[3:24:33] 91Niki: @valianya Playable is a very very loose term. You can have an internal demo where you can walk around in a world but not interact with anything.
[3:24:52] SpilledMelk: *Vulture Capitalist
[3:24:58] kharnij83: call of duty is prime example of that the company can release half ass games yearly and people will play it. just refresh old content over and over.
[3:25:08] AzedaNA: Man I just miss the days of getting Pizza Hut demo discs full of wild games

[3:26:41] AzedaNA: I mean they could do what Kojima did, he borrowed an engine when he left Konami. He could have someone else's engine to build off of. Saves tons of time
[3:26:45] LavaVaYn3: yeaa
[3:26:58] im_capy: Kinda like a division type game looter shooter?
[3:27:09] LavaVaYn3: they can ealy rip takes from like destiny and wow then

[3:28:38] DarthWrex: Disney invested 1.5bn to Epic Games
[3:28:54] LavaVaYn3: i mean kingdome hearts was cooool
[3:28:56] AzedaNA: You going to have Mickey Mouse gunning people down?

[15:54:00] Masqerader: and sure enough they laid people off
[15:54:36] NOS_4EVR: layoffs are sadly part of a merger
[15:55:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoWGrandma pog
[15:56:02] dinomiyte: i use to raid with wowgrandma wayyyy before she became a streamer lol
[15:56:43] Masqerader: @NOS_4EVR the point your missing is "Microsoft said in court that Act/Blizzard would be separate from Microsoft and would remain independent, and microsoft then laid 1900 people off including those in act/blizzard
[15:56:44] sohkomz: you don’t take anyone else’s career into account when they are part of the wow community, why would you just because they work at bliz
[15:57:08] MedicineMan: Mike was also huge support of Twitch. Before him, Blizz wouldnt do drops or any sort of Twitch X Blizzard events.
[15:57:14] MedicineMan: supporter *
[15:57:42] Palgor: Now you kill em Sir, position is the key
[15:57:56] Palgor: Go
[15:58:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Johanna Faries (new Blizzard president) says she currently plays a lot of D4 and COD and BG3
[15:58:35] Palgor: Pala tanks do not die
[15:59:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: I have no idea if that change in leadership is going to affect the drops and such at all, I would guess they have data now on how it works to help promote the game

[16:09:07] Palgor: graet job!
[16:09:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: I was wondering if anyone was finding new runes yet
[16:10:17] Palgor: Then silence Rag or what  that being call him :)
[16:10:29] Palgor: Igo for it Rag!
[16:10:57] Palgor: Sorry:)
[16:11:14] Palgor: But do I doutb, never
[16:11:34] kyshen3: I don't miss Mythic raiding
[16:11:42] Palgor: You allways do your best
[16:11:54] Trapsmaker: how much time left for s4
[16:12:05] kyshen3: Bro i got AOTC and got like 4/8. Like i dunno i swear Mythic can just bring the worst out of people.
[16:12:14] devildriver1919: i thought it was a pretty good tier, but i dont liker the amount of 1 shot shit in mythic on the last few bosses
[16:12:20] Lepi253: Time to smoke a blunt and level my disc priest on classic
[16:12:22] devildriver1919: i ended up not going to bed >_<

[16:12:44] Palgor: I miss this shit my self waiting fur pull
[16:12:45] kyshen3: 4/8 Mythic. Noticed  just how more high strung people get.  Some raiders and even leads talk really sideways to people also
[16:12:50] MedicineMan: Haven't cared about AOTC since Nathria
[16:13:12] Palgor: Do it hf
[16:13:17] kyshen3: Yep
[16:13:21] Kneckt: @Molvonos new post is up for rune discoveries, might be more worthy of a pin https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/phase-2-runes-discovered-day-1-discoveries-for-season-of-discovery-337638

[16:14:19] Kneckt: EZ
[16:14:25] kyshen3: I do enjoy high level mythic.
[16:14:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: That new warlock rune they found looks like it could be really good for their tanking, but I'd see how that works in practice
[16:14:31] kyshen3: much more then i do raiding
[16:15:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: "Dance of the Wicked"
[16:15:50] devildriver1919: son of a hooker, just got to like level 10 on sod and realized it i did it on wrong account....
[16:16:04] Palgor: Oliko siinä?
[16:16:08] CDubTheRIPper: towLfg
[16:16:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Well, the good news is with that 50% exp boost until level 25, it probably won't take too long to get another up to level 10 and be caught up
[16:16:44] Palgor: Vittu jees!!!!
[16:16:58] kyshen3: 50% in sod?
[16:17:17] Palgor: GG People!
[16:17:33] Palgor: Oh
[16:17:39] Palgor: Sorry
[16:17:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they added an exp boost to SOD this week, they say it's permanent for lower than level 25
[16:18:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Makes sense, as a kind of catch up mechanic

[16:23:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: In AWC they play on a tournament realm, so all the players have access to the legendary axe if their class can use it... most of them transmogged it to look like something else. Seemed wrong to me
[16:23:49] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892

[17:25:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah too much will trigger Classic people, yes LUL
[17:25:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Is it too late to play SOD season 2?
[17:26:30] Pups_Gersky: I think I'm gonna just level cap then back track for runes. One of the hunter runes is a lvl 35 mob kill, the other one discovered requires you to go to STV.
[17:26:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's not too late at all, it just started and there is that 50% exp buff up until level 25
[17:27:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think a person could start a brand new toon and be doing the raid in like 2 weeks, without even going super sweaty

[17:43:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: It looks fairly simple but Big Will is probably a pain in the ass LUL

[19:01:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I don't know that it's really necessary to do any of the whirlwind stuff if you're grinding SM Armory, with the 2h axe that cran drop off the last guy
[19:03:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: yeah it's the ravager axe that can proc that special attack, vs. the whirlwind one that has good stats
[19:03:32] xsp00n: we swapped when sweeping strikes is on CD
[19:03:41] Pups_Gersky: Having a mount would make the questline so much faster but you can't get any bonus XP from the items after you hit lvl 40 so the long walk life is real.

[26:21:19] im_capy: Sleeping bag.....we gonna need a RV for P4
[26:21:37] Clucky2988: @Molvonos perma or time till exp?
[26:21:38] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892
[26:21:59] Molvonos: @Clucky2988 Its just a buff that you can turn off, so I imagine permanent for the 1 to 25 experience until further notice.
[26:22:14] Maydie6066: My issue with classic and SoD is just the constant movement for questing, an area might have 50 total quests, but you can only do the first 5 at a certain level, then you need to come back for the next 10, then back again for the next 25, its just so much traveling to find a smooth leveling path
[26:23:43] Clucky2988: @Molvonos cool ty :)

[31:01:54] illari_storm: I personally enjoyed it cause it allowed me to go enjoy other games for a bit while waiting for phase 2.
[31:02:10] im_capy: People need to diversify their games, play all versions of WoW if wow is your only thing, or play other things.

[31:05:19] TheGiant99: This really happens with every game lately. Everyone is in a mad rush to get to the end all the time.
[31:05:21] SpidercowSD: Isnt this classic +
[31:05:27] rakimm: classic ++
[31:05:36] SpidercowSD: isnt this going to roll into new content 60+
[31:05:40] toobaked1987: I think manipulating Classic for a higher playerbase is just about over.
[31:05:49] hammack52: i have said this to others before SoD IS classic+
[31:05:51] Throdio: People wanting Classic+ just me J. Allen Brack was right with the You think you do, but you don't quote
[31:05:57] Thoreya: @SpidercowSD the road map doesnt seem much at 60
[31:06:00] ZansTeamCaptain: im not built for it :(
[31:07:01] toobaked1987: I hit 60 in Hardcore. Ive had my true classic experience
[31:07:07] im_capy: HC, SoD, Classic era doesnt take tons of time or money. Blizz can justify them with Sub money, but anything more....nah
[31:07:10] SpidercowSD: @Thoreya I thought 60+ they had plans to explore unused classic content, plus we have multiple preset raids already to do for the classic grind ect
[31:07:35] Brydus: Brydus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[31:07:46] Throdio: @hammack52 It's the closest there is going to be. Expect for perhaps class tuning. But nothing with new assets.
[31:08:00] TheGiant99: Will be tons of SoD drop off when cata classic comes and then war within
[31:09:27] A_Rescue_Panda: @Towelliee what is the xp bar you have on the top of your screen?
[31:09:27] Moobot: https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1743035635030691892

[31:10:12] Niksen_99: There is a store on Classic wrath

[32:21:29] warriorzen: Never had to do it so not sure
[32:21:30] LimpyMcGee1: more likely to die from debris so you get low
[32:21:41] warriorzen: Could be the same as duck and cover for nukes for all I know

[32:22:01] 91Niki: We had a mini tornado here where I live in Denmark back in early 2000. Incredibly rare here. Destroyed a farm half a mile from here. Went RIGHT over our house but was "out of gas", went through out forest and tore a hole in it, and destroyed another house half a mile the other way. It is a fucking miracle it didn't rip up our house
[32:22:50] LimpyMcGee1: depends on the downforce of the winds
[32:23:14] SpilledMelk: The major danger is debris not the wind

[32:23:19] sircheex: a lot of the problem with tornados is flying debree, getting in a ditch is a lower chancd of getting hit with shit
[32:23:21] 91Niki: We had ducks back then and it picked up one of their houses and tossed it around in the air. We checked it out the day after and an egg in there was still whole KEKW
[32:23:26] Truckjr72: I have been through 3 tornadoes one in 89 and 2 in 95 while in the army
[32:23:27] im_capy: be in a ditch all you want, car falling on top aint gonna save you
[32:23:40] hammack52: it is always best to get as low as you can in a tornado, keeps wind from getting under you and lifting you up and help dodge debris
[32:23:47] sandychicken2: i would imagine you would have to worry about the tornado throwing stuff at you
[32:24:13] im_capy: a pebble could hit you and itd be like being shot by a gun
[32:24:49] SpilledMelk: Getting hit by a hundred mile an hour piece of wood or metal shrapnel is not great
[32:24:55] LearnedSomething: if it's not moving sideways you're in its way

[32:25:00] Valstraz19: if the tornado looks like its not moving, it is coming at you.
[32:25:33] RuinTV: The building was an older 1940's campus lab and was heavy masonry, was fine minus windows and trees outside. But was crazy.
[32:25:47] LimpyMcGee1: in oklahoma its as long as you can still sit on your porch and drink your beer, your fine. enjoy the show
[32:26:22] RuinTV: There is so much debris and particulate material in the air that the sky changes color, was a really off green.
[32:27:03] LimpyMcGee1: ive seen a tornado pull an almost 180 turn. they can do crazy shit
[32:27:19] SpilledMelk: Tornados LOVE trailer parks
[32:27:23] LearnedSomething: hang on let me call 1-800-TORNADO and ask them
[32:27:37] im_capy: Crazy that insurance companies are like....so you want to build in tornado alley? ok makes sense let's do it
[32:28:36] LimpyMcGee1: its just called disaster insurance. most homes come with it here
[32:28:53] LearnedSomething: act of god coverage
[32:29:00] im_capy: Have a family friend that has a place in North Carolina they use for tax reasons(they rich). They have to rebuild it every other year, and its still worth it for them investment wise that is
[32:29:13] SpilledMelk: Even crazier to build a whole city below sea level ( New Orleans)
[32:29:34] Alcaeus_: I got the priest scroll, that was nice
[32:29:36] futomara01: @SpilledMelk or country (netherlands)
[32:29:40] 91Niki: I'm just glad the incredibly rare tornados we do have here in Denmark, are no bigger than waterspouts. They can't do any serious damage
[32:29:50] LearnedSomething: or continent (atlantis)
[32:29:57] SpilledMelk: True

[43:44:18] 3663Sharad: 14 iirc
[43:45:37] shaxxtv: retail is too easy to  gear in imo
[43:46:11] HkaemPoV: @shaxxtv I dont want to spend most of my time getting gear to do the content i want to do
[43:46:18] Ision47: yeah
[43:46:46] 3663Sharad: I'm finally able to gear alts again. Wasn't capable of doing that since WoD
[43:46:50] 3663Sharad: it feels great
[43:46:59] Seerated: I for one who for the first time started last exp late, like now, is totally overwhelmed with all the new shit. Should've started at the beginning :/
[43:46:59] Bucket_AU: After not playing retail for 2 xpacs and primarily enjoying arena, I watch it now and there is just so much shit on the screen it's impossible to know what is happening.
[43:47:09] Bucket_AU: It's quite over the top
[43:47:18] Seerated: Bags are overflowing with reagents and stuff I have to Wowhead each one

[43:48:04] Screamnsteam: f
[43:48:07] shaxxtv: but retail wow is all about end game as towelie just said. Is that warcraft? no one enjoys the zones anymore, story and stuff like that.  you play for the end game not the journey. shame if you ask me.

[43:50:24] shaxxtv: not everyone is like that ofc. But feel like most people are
[43:50:49] TheMixedNuts: Retail has less friction and I'm all for it. Classic is for us nerds that started at launch and played through traditional mmos, but you can't deny retail is just a better "game"
[43:51:07] Niksen_99: Are you drinking scotch tonight :D
[43:51:09] shaxxtv: @Bixster i wouldnt say so. back in the days you  could still do stuff without being highest level. now people just rush to max level dont  care about the campaign and stuff like that

[43:55:36] shaxxtv: but well a lot of people like and some dont cause make eveyrone happy.. but i think there is a reason why numbers are lower.. ofcourse there is way more options on the market but i think when you can get to end game and do end game so easy. thats losing some people aswell :)

[45:22:51] KiwiGuy17: Think about it, 100 billion stars in our own galaxy, 1% should have Earth like planets orbiting them. Then you have trillions of other galaxies, seems improbable we are the only lifeforms in the cosmos

[45:27:06] ClassicMalcontent: I mean I don't know that guy's work but a lot of world history has claims of 'giants' / demigods etc. Pick a world religion or a world history. Christianity called them Nephilim. Islam has not exactly same but concept of Djinn. Greeks Romans said giants/cyclops. So its not just one culture its many with 'giants' or call them 'visitors' ETs / 'fallen angels' aka 'demons' whatever else. Call them what you will.
[45:27:14] iamgolden3: that's a good idea haha
