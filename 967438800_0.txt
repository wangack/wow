[1:28:05] TheNorthernGiant: On a supercharger, 20 mins for 80% charge. The last 20% takes 20 more minutes.
[1:28:17] AureliusXV: im good with electric cars
[1:28:17] mythradrill: i dont get the trend with electric cars. personally i dont like them. each on his own i guess

[1:28:39] IAmTheJeff: on a long trip I think most of them have a navigator that knows where all the charging stations are and will plan your drive accordingly
[1:28:39] TheNorthernGiant: At home, takes about 6 hours to 4 ish hours to full charge from 0.
[1:28:47] dcmaniac11: I just logged into battle net this morning and my classic wow was uninstalled that’s weird
[1:28:49] Eikus11: what is the wait time for the Mach E @Towelliee ?
[1:28:51] cynical_effect12: But west coast won’t be an issue for charging stations, the Midwest would probably be kinda dicey
[1:29:00] Molseh: More than that likely

[1:29:10] Hokypoky: you will never go down to 0 on your E-Car !
[1:29:11] TheNorthernGiant: That's with a 400v
[1:29:16] heyhey510: @Towelliee are there ppl on BC beta that have reached capped lvl in less 12 hours?
[1:29:23] AureliusXV: takes 5 minutes to fill up the tank lol
[1:29:23] sapmyballs: @Towelliee in Pre-Patch PVP Rank Requirements should go from the gear and will just be a flat out honor requirment. So should be able to grind BGs for decent gear for levelling
[1:29:23] heyhey510: not 70
[1:29:24] MrGattz: maybe a 45 min top off
[1:29:26] tehswede: buy a tesla fast charger for house lol
[1:29:30] ArcaneSyntax: oh god im gonna have to level up my 1h skill for when i get Dual wield
[1:29:44] DjLamboImBenz: You should keep the battery between 20 and 80%, charging from 20-80 doesnt take that long, however, 80-100 takes a while
[1:29:57] Bixster: its depends on the charger. if you want to charge to max you have to slow charge. fast charging only charges up to 80ish %
[1:30:15] AureliusXV: thats dumb
[1:30:18] AureliusXV: imk
[1:30:23] AureliusXV: lol
[1:30:38] TheNorthernGiant: Not tempted by a Tesla?
[1:31:02] Molseh: Gotta have an EV to live in CA LUL
[1:31:20] AureliusXV: i had a 2004 mustang gt, had it for 10 years only issued i had was the throwout bearing went

[1:44:10] coldhandsbeatz: I dont think SL is bad but the content delivery will kill it. If it was that 77 days shit from Legion it would be a great expansion
[1:44:11] ColdChillXI: I got 2 mounts then moved to classic
[1:44:25] Seerated: I ran 8/8 Torghast on 4 alts last week, wanted to off myself tbh. They could atleast increase the damn Soul Ash

[1:45:22] wvivar: 560 soul ash for level 8? Its a lot of work lol.
[1:45:24] FatChase: I wish if the option was there to grind out soul ash without a cap I'd 100% do it
[1:45:26] TheUnknowing: I think SL had potential but its just fucked by covid honestly, idk when the expac will pick up but we will see.

[1:46:42] TheUnknowing: I mean every tank is getting that buff, so idk if that changes anything for prot pally
[1:47:02] wvivar: @Samurai3434 thats a good question .
[1:47:30] RocketMan23: ya but if prot pally becomes more viable then their damage can separate them from the pack
[1:47:52] TheUnknowing: I can see the queues being bad since so many have quit

[2:00:17] Dassad517: Do you have to buy TBC or do you get it since u own classic WoW?
[2:00:17] realdevv: They need to keep doing fresh launches of vanilla/bc/wrath on a 1.5-2 year rollout reset, the Classic andies will keep playing forever.
[2:00:27] DoubleNova: Maybe they will do Classic Seasons?
[2:00:35] realdevv: Just like we have on private servers for 10+ years

[2:04:51] LazyDynamics: hey, watched your SL video last night. do you think there would`ve been more incentive to play for you if pvp gearing was less powerful?
[2:05:04] Turomori: Hey Towelliee, I wanna start tanking in retail but I'm anxious, any tips for someone who's never done it before?
[2:05:14] MrGattz: @LazyDynamics the answer isnt to nerf pvp gear, its to buff everything else

[2:06:18] Sandman_88: lol pay
[2:06:20] DjLamboImBenz: You need to pay if you want your char on both servers

[2:06:57] Zansteh: true
[2:07:04] ArcaneSyntax: they should merge classic servers there's  so many that are dead.
[2:07:24] LazyDynamics: @MrGattz i dont care too much on the power of gear, i just think the pvp gear took out the whole pve gearing gameplay loop
[2:07:28] geokouts: kill lich that spawns skeleton minions and loot the philatery after
[2:07:33] desmo7: like nostalrius
[2:07:44] warrenny: Yes!
[2:07:59] Seerated: Yea, you need a group there, elites allover
[2:08:12] warrenny: Hope they do wan5 to play classic properly
[2:08:14] MrGattz: @Turomori knowing how to tank is a good start. if you already know how to tank well and you know your cds then just watch a couple videos on the dungeon before you do it. sl dungeons are very easy to learn because they are pretty linear. then just go in and do it. also know that people are ass holes and you might get a whisper or two but just ignore it. you wont really learn it until you run them several times.
[2:08:24] warrenny: and clear the raids
[2:09:03] stolidgravy: stolidgravy subscribed with Prime. 
[2:09:06] howlingstorms: Will it be easier to be horde in tbc if u want to do most thinks I went ally in classic
[2:09:31] MrGattz: @LazyDynamics yeah thats what i mean. its not to bring to pvp to where pve gear is. its to bring up pve to where pvp gear is. a proper vender. a scalable way to gain valor with every dungeon or raid that you do. the same system for upgrading as pvp. stuff like that.
[2:09:38] johnnypeterz: is this live or beta?
[2:09:39] Sandman_88: silence is unsettling.
[2:10:05] bruhSit_farmer: silence + sub price changes looking real sus
[2:10:25] TheUnknowing: I honestly don't think ive ever been this concerned for the game, even in draenor.
[2:10:28] sphynx_13: @Towelliee  i'm ok with them delaying the new patch. There are tons of games out there that can be played. I don't mind not paying the SUB for 2-3 months.
[2:11:02] sultan_of_sauce91: how do i join the sqaud im gonna start classic to get ready for tbc!
[2:11:03] LazyDynamics: @MrGattz thats true. thought you meant just to increase the ilvl of pve gear

[2:11:31] bruhSit_farmer: you crazy @Thoreya
[2:11:34] Collected1: All this talk about sleep streams. Towelliee was way ahead of that curve.
[2:11:36] TheUnknowing: there is no way they had that many @Thoreya id be surprised if they did
[2:11:36] Thoreya: They said they had the highest subs since cata
[2:11:40] Octale: I think that's EPL
[2:11:42] Thoreya: They said that multiple times lmao
[2:11:42] geokouts: the toilet guy is in Searing Gorge
[2:12:10] bruhSit_farmer: they didnt have 10m lmao they had highest sold expac

[2:12:32] Nyvill: @Towelliee wolves share spawns with carrion lurkers, it takes ages if u dont kill both LUL
[2:12:38] Thoreya: They literally said”highest engagement for the past decade. Which would be since 2010. Which is cata. So
[2:12:38] Sandman_88: actual delusional 10mil subs lol
[2:12:52] torridcheese3: I liked WoD launch more than SL launch tbh
[2:12:55] bruhSit_farmer: yea they dont measure engagement by subs thor
[2:13:14] AceFFS: They didn't have any work on patches done after release, if they had released 9.1 when 9.0.5 released might of kept people going
[2:13:15] Sandman_88: now that sounds right

[2:18:10] Sonatta: wolf POGGERS
[2:18:11] FluffehZ: @Towelliee these missions are brand new content and not recycled missions from the campaign
[2:18:18] ImOnlyTom: I like swtors way of subs. You can pay the sub to unlock more character slots and to play the most recent expansion and any expansions you buy, you keep and can play all the way up to the beginning of the most recent expac
[2:18:36] Raazeraz: its behind the sawmill
[2:18:42] AceFFS: You can only put it down to mismanagement? how can  a team not be working on the first patch before SL was released?
[2:19:02] Thoreya: Ima continue playing wow lmao. No other games on the market I have an interest in playing and don’t have much time to play anything else so. I’ll be here HeyGuys LUL
[2:19:29] dimofodi: lmao
[2:19:31] dimofodi: i can jump
[2:19:34] dimofodi: just not very high
[2:19:36] itsAlz1: i love WoW but fuck SL i can't be bothered jumping on it and its the only MMO i'd play tbh
[2:19:41] bruhSit_farmer: @Thoreya literally no one asked

[2:20:20] WebsterLou: i heard ;)
[2:20:38] bruhSit_farmer: no 9.3 but theres wod 2.0
[2:20:46] FatChase: WoD 2.0 PepeHands
[2:20:46] othraerir: fuck that
[2:20:48] Seerated: Pandemic messed up so much of the ’normalities’ of the world. So much more than the stay in/wash hands. Kinda interesting, albeit sad/worrysome. We’ve kinda had no word from anyone, left in the dust and players notice
[2:20:51] NexusOps: wonder what's 10.0 is going to be rooThink
[2:20:52] Thoreya: Just give us a fat 10.0
[2:20:55] DoubleNova: 2 patches for this xpac?
[2:20:57] coldhandsbeatz: WoD 2.0?
[2:21:03] Thoreya: Since everyone is obv done with shadowlands after 4 months lol

[2:21:28] gurunoni: BFA wasn't that bad.
[2:21:35] azzurrin: Miss Legion
[2:21:35] dimofodi: I was thinking we'd end up with a 9.1.5 and a 9.2.5 with the raids but not the other content really
[2:21:42] Sonatta: Magni's got some of that sweet sweet azerite for you
[2:21:45] N64atNite: SL was a flop and they are going to end it early
[2:21:55] captain_steve_rogers: wait you playing Star Trek Online
[2:22:04] Daf54: Would be nice if atleast they told us anything about their plans
[2:22:07] coldhandsbeatz: I miss Legion so much
[2:22:13] Gnral: wrath private servers are full these days
[2:22:14] keeindordel: @Cluexy  idk how u consider it a "flop"?
[2:22:24] gurunoni: Legion was top 3 for me.
[2:22:49] Pallananana: I still cry about draenor shafting shattrat BibleThump
[2:22:50] keeindordel: nah i think were gonna ahve the Void Lords invade the Shadowlands by the end of the expansion
[2:23:05] Vajazle: that's mad
[2:23:14] mavericks312: i think they push the next expansion back
[2:23:26] sphynx_rayne: Wow is just not there for me. We will see if I want to come back with the patch in the summer.
[2:23:28] Pallananana: Not gonna lie, i don't want to think about that for a second FeelsBadMan
[2:23:30] Shrandamar: if they dont want to pull another WoD they should push the next expansion back tbh
[2:23:35] onlygoesham: why do they have to make new expansion just play this one out so what if it takes longer
[2:23:45] Thoreya: Hopefully they’ll stop adding player power next wxpansion and give us like a  fourth spec and a new class. Something that doesn’t get thrown away for the 4th expansion in a row like player power

[2:24:16] niceteis: shadowlands is the worst expansion they made imo
[2:24:18] dimofodi: I don't see a huge issue with a 3 year expansion as long as it starts moving faster than 9.0 to 9.1 but that's unlikely
[2:24:25] maalow: I think they'll do that, we can only know when they're back at the office

[2:24:55] N64atNite: 3 years of SL oh boy
[2:24:56] Shrandamar: @keeindordel I know, but if they dont do that they will have to cut shadowlands short by 1 patch just to push the next expansion out
[2:25:00] Sollice: @dimofodi It's not going to move faster for sure. It's going to be a 3 year expansion because things are going to keep moving slow
[2:25:00] dimofodi: @keeindordel yes I did but I stopped playing in SoO pre-patch.
[2:25:00] AceFFS: Their business model is to release expansions every ? years, will cost them money to delay a expansion
[2:25:05] sphynx_rayne: I don't care if SL is longer if it started it to play out better in the end
[2:25:13] keeindordel: @dimofodi because if u played in MoP i think you've forggotten all the bitching and moaning when  ppl were playing in patch 5.4 and Siege of orgrimmar for a year and a half

[3:29:29] Kinghorn: nope gotta pay for it, we dont know how much
[3:29:30] Alind777: How buggy does this feel in comparison to the Vanilla beta? Do you think it's closer to being ready than the first few iterations of vanilla classic?
[3:29:33] Seerated: Stacks up real fast
[3:29:41] FatChase: The error sounds towW towW

[3:30:52] Seerated: I still have those "101 Tankadin- Winchester"- links, now dead unless waybackmachine
[3:31:52] LSBreed: Was it BC paladin tanks had like a 3-6-12 rotation or something?

[3:34:39] Nacaseven: I loved the stealth runs with only druids and rogues. Avoiding all the trash and only kill the bosses. It became preety popular and every day people asked me for an stealth run and they need an Tank.

[3:39:09] Light2512: @Towelliee ok i see ur talents?
[3:39:10] LSBreed: man that ret hits like a truck when wf goes off.
[3:39:21] Chiraakitteh: Plus, as a belf, you’re dpsing with style!
[3:39:29] LSBreed: watched that mobs health evaporate
[3:40:14] LSBreed: now these were always spicy pulls.
[3:40:25] Reesezpiecez: ah a time when the tank needs to drink more than the healer. simpler times
[3:40:39] WhiteKnight74648: @Chiraakitteh Especially with that outfit
[3:40:40] Seerated: The absolute best feeling in BC was when all the mobs actually beat themselves to death and you reflected it all :)
[3:40:47] studoge66: does Pally not have a taunt still in BC?
[3:41:07] choopy27: You gotta be top DMG at this point
[3:41:18] Seerated: Pally had, but you taunted of the person with threat, instead of taunting the mob
[3:41:22] RavenLSN7: The number mason!
[3:41:26] JBonezey: Now show a Paladin MT a raid. Get the f out of here
[3:41:41] studoge66: @Seerated is that how it is going to be working in TBC classic too?

[3:42:26] PokerFaceMoose: i think most people will just take whatever tank shows up
[3:42:44] Seerated: @studoge66 Yea, I suppose. Righteous Defense was like that back then ,so you'd macro it if I remember correctly. I mean they're not changin basic spells/abilities afaik
[3:42:59] metavahn231: ill take warrior over pal so i dont gotta wait for paladin drink
[3:43:16] studoge66: @Seerated just seems a bit annoying to use hahaha rather than the regular taunt on enemy
[3:43:17] creamdonut: isn't it somewhat too easy?
[3:43:36] Telmorra: boss fights you dont go oom since you get way more dmg in
[3:43:46] metavahn231: im just trollin lol , warrior is trash in tbc
[3:43:52] JBonezey: We have multiple Warriors with Thunderfurys, we'll see
[3:43:54] alex12645: there a lot of mana per sec items in tbc
[3:43:54] Seerated: Yea, it's kinda backwards, and we have to remember we're ocming off 10+ years of Live, and now getting back to how it used to be =)
[3:43:56] GoKu1g: @Towelliee GEt the druid to innervate you on cooldown haha xD
[3:43:56] Ambersulfr: I mean... healer has to drink too. I rather, as a healer, have the paladin because the warriors like to rush from pack to pack to maintain their rage without checking on the other players.
[3:44:10] Ehpik: period.
[3:44:25] Emilos711: ye ye, but in pvp pala will always be warriors heal bot :)
[3:44:30] Maego1: imagine those lucky blood elf paladins getting thunderfury during prepatch
[3:44:35] JerBoody: I had sooo much fun tanking on prot warrior in tbc heroics and the 10 man raids i just can’t imagine playing something else
[3:44:43] ArcaneSyntax: people acting like prot pallies wont have mana regen through blessings judgements and shaman totems @towelliee
[3:44:43] Arelles_: he has been
[3:45:06] ChristendomBaffler: even without playing back then, my one memory related to prot pallies is SK taking WF in SWP
[3:45:08] zskeech: towelliee will quit 1 month in tbc anyway
[3:45:08] Zaanthrax: same here, Prot war is life <3
[3:45:29] metavahn231: why does consc look so much better in classic than on retail

[3:46:17] studoge66: so why is Towellie not using the taunt on the players who are getting aggro? just mana issue?

[3:47:13] metavahn231: dps is expendable, MT is not LUL
[3:47:19] metavahn231: bye bye dps
[3:47:29] ArcaneSyntax: @lekkahdh ret us using anc aura, which is better for him
[3:47:37] Daledo907: How's that Sporegar shield treatin ya?
[3:47:39] ArcaneSyntax: sanc aura
[3:47:43] ezpiron_tv: @Towelliee technically you should give tempest to warlocks first, and you just use the mace that drops off trash, because they cant use the mace
[3:47:53] Fillos08: hey. I've checkt Towelliees UI packeges, but couldnt find the Classic WeakAura that shows the XP/h, time to lev. etc. does anyone know what WA that is?
[3:47:58] lekkahdh: ahhhh nice thanks @ArcaneSyntax
[3:47:59] Seerated: @studoge66 Don't think he cba to taunt off, noone's in any danger and they're just running stuff over

[3:48:40] love_eggplant: i wanna see them
[3:48:48] metavahn231: it was probably alot more important ot gear your tank in classic, for threat issues, in retail you dont care about tanks gearing much
[3:49:08] RetroMetros: Beta  I mean, since the template has 60%
[3:49:46] Ramzilla92: there are maces with spellpower in TBC right?
[3:49:51] FamousAm0s: famous85Feedme
[3:50:13] GoodBoy955: why not use hammer of judgement and give tempest of chaos to the warlock

[3:50:25] reklebin: How are resto druids in tbc?

[3:50:32] Seerated: Towelliee, would you mind testing if my old macro still works ?

[3:51:38] ezpiron_tv: @Towelliee once you get the libram that increases your seal damage you seal twist when tanking a boss when you get to that point in BT
[3:51:40] metavahn231: i heard there's some macro for totem/seal twisting that makes it easy more, its either that or not doing it at all heh

[3:55:34] SlayerLightStorm: towHAMUP Hammers Up!
[3:55:54] jaythaog: What makes prot so good in tbc can someone tel me
[3:56:14] themaliciousrabbit: @jaythaog They're the only tank with consistent aoe threat
[3:56:33] themaliciousrabbit: Warriors and bears can only take threat on up to like 3 targets at a time reliably.
[3:56:35] BackseatGM: Watching shaman chain lightning everything looks really beefy as well
[3:56:41] Ertra: that healer is puttin in work
[3:56:44] Seerated: Look at those numbers what in da actual !
[3:56:49] jaythaog: Ah ok yeah that’s huge
[3:56:50] ArcaneSyntax: i really want the itsemization from TBC. classic's is so bad.
[3:57:22] ezpiron_tv: @Towelliee im hoping they do, warriors can miss taunt so often without that QOL change, private servers like endless did that change, and it helped so much
[3:57:23] themaliciousrabbit: They're really really good in dungeons, but they'll almost never main taink. You're always the off tank for trash/boss adds
[3:58:20] pronkk_: is this wotlk music in bc? lol
[3:58:45] GlakusWoW: does prot paly have a taunt in TBC? @Towelliee
[3:58:57] ezpiron_tv: prot pallys have two taunts
[3:58:58] themaliciousrabbit: I'm pretty sure you can set up a cast taunt on target of target macro so you dont have to hover over anyone

[4:03:25] puffinstogies420: 7 ads? jesus christ
[4:03:40] Ambersulfr: It's worth it to repeat content in TBC
[4:03:42] Cryttan: lol true, it will be even better. Why didn't I think of that
[4:03:59] Ambersulfr: One of the mistakes I personally think Blizzard has been making recently is removing that motivation.

[4:04:58] eyonixz: resto druids are kings in tbc
[4:05:03] themaliciousrabbit: Heres a good taunt macro if you want to give it a go, should just cast taunt on whatever the enemy is attacking so you dont have to mouseover: /cast [help] Righteous Defense; [target=targettarget] Righteous Defense
[4:05:07] BraerHZ: 4? I got 7. Been here minutes and still waiting to watch

[4:29:40] Malebolgea: And is 50g is that big of a deal in tbc?
[4:29:44] DrMantisTBaggin: i guess its less character identity?
[4:29:45] jambii03: do you get to keep this character?
[4:29:50] Anzel_1: classic purists in general it'll make em mad
[4:29:51] SamULJackson: i cant think of a downside too. if anything it opens up more opportunities for most people doing more content
[4:29:57] ArcaneSyntax: old man confused by doors
[4:29:59] thom_j: Will they add Warriors for Bloodelf this time for TBC you think @towelliee ?
[4:30:06] Malebolgea: So i dont think we really need dual specs
[4:30:09] Whoracle1337: the ship is unstuck :O
[4:30:09] enzancow: I wouldn't say you make a shit ton.
[4:30:09] markmclean24: yeah but you would be able to switch between heal and tank
[4:30:14] gali5656: 60 g is like 2.5-3 dailys
[4:30:15] Whoracle1337: suez canal is free
[4:30:18] Anzel_1: good.
[4:30:18] Mecabeast: more gold in the economy or meaningful choicew
[4:30:22] BlueBeast33: A lot of people's offspec though with dual spec would be for pvp though
[4:30:25] Yazabell: Being able to quest and going in dungeons as tank  or healer will make life so much easier for so many
[4:30:27] Folgrum: classic purists will  play anyway so why care about em
[4:30:32] Anzel_1: Yeah true.
[4:30:38] DoubleNova: #allthechanges
[4:30:40] Malebolgea: Yeah, store mounts, tokens, boosts are coming, and that's sad
[4:30:41] Anzel_1: Yo dudes, what should I level on retail
[4:30:43] kamisengames: FACTION CHANGES???!!!!???!??!?!?!?!?!?!?
[4:30:48] Frank4LuLz: i want shadowmore...take my money
[4:30:52] love_eggplant: what more will be added you think?
[4:30:53] alex12645: voip was added in tbc
[4:30:56] Reddevc: faction change pls, horde was a mistake
[4:30:57] enzancow: If they only did dual spec, I would be happy.
[4:31:04] king_mike27: dose your gfuel code work for EU @towelliee
[4:31:09] Parthuax: !playlist
[4:31:12] Malebolgea: People data mined a store mount in TBC client already i think?
[4:31:13] love_eggplant: how is token QoL
[4:31:17] KodyTheTyger: so many people buy gold i wouldn't blame them if they added the token
[4:31:18] Zip13: I figure token by sunwell or legacy wrath
[4:31:20] rhodeos_: i'd say its all thanos...inevitable
[4:31:22] ArcaneSyntax: also if all the classic purists leave maybe the game will have less people yelling slurs at each other.
[4:31:29] maverickjaeshiga: As long as the LFG system stays away, that IMO started the killing of the social impact of the game
[4:31:34] Digitalspork: @ArcaneSyntax Ooop
[4:31:35] solsaver12: true Arcane
[4:31:37] ezpiron_tv: go look at karazhan too @Towelliee
[4:31:42] Zip13: @malebolgea it’s probably a gold sink in itself or a 6 month sub perk
[4:31:42] Yazabell: faction change would bring alot of cash in i reckon
[4:31:48] SamULJackson: on the moon too?
[4:31:52] Frank4LuLz: i want frostmorne...take my money
[4:31:57] nintendyoh: They said they were removing "batching". I heard in a video I think.
[4:31:58] Anzel_1: well they mined the mount up but we still don't know what that mount was for specifically
[4:32:01] kamisengames: LFG could never  come to classic and it would be amazing
[4:32:12] Zip13: Faction changing WutFace
[4:32:16] Wardog442: Hell no
[4:32:17] Malebolgea: @Zip13 If its a 6months sub perk - its a store mount, and im pretty sure they're testing the water with it, more are coming
[4:32:24] Wardog442: There shouldnt even be a boost option
[4:32:28] xdonnyladx: Burning Crusade Classic: Deluxe Edition incoming
[4:32:36] thom_j: Will they add the Warrior class for Bloodelf @Towelliee
[4:32:42] ezpiron_tv: go look at karazhan too @Towelliee
[4:32:48] Wardog442: No, Thomj
[4:32:48] Connectus: @imanzel it's literally tagged TBCC: DE item so it's for a deluxe edition of TBC
[4:32:50] love_eggplant: are they gonna give bonus stuff to unbalanced faction servers?
[4:32:56] dalaraz: id love free transfers off of full servers
[4:32:59] love_eggplant: when u play the low pop faction
[4:33:02] Digitalspork: LUL
[4:33:06] Parthuax: Parthuax subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Cheers dude
[4:33:11] kamisengames: I just want my Alliance pally to be horde for TBC
[4:33:14] xdonnyladx: there is you get a ground mount
[4:33:14] thom_j: April fools joke incoming
[4:33:17] Razor9mm: Still expecting May 18 for prepatch
[4:33:22] FatChase: I really hope they troll the classic andys on April 1st KEKW
[4:33:32] LZ9z: Dual spec should have to require the trainer. Only reason I would want dual for pvp and I think that is the main concern for the request. @Towelliee
[4:33:45] SamULJackson: april fools: demon hunter playable class in tbc
[4:33:46] Reddevc: Sadge
[4:33:46] Anzel_1: @connectus Yeah, but im saying we don't know if its for TBC:C or a mount reward for retail.
[4:33:46] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:33:47] CDubTheRIPper: thatd be cruel LUL
[4:33:50] Zip13: 9.1 in 2021 Jebaited
[4:34:03] rhodeos_: watch, on april first comes the lvl 60 boost and honor boosts to classic servers
[4:34:09] maccaruso: 9.1 - Feb 2022
[4:34:11] Anzel_1: Demon hunters in TBC let's gooooo
[4:34:12] 91Niki: April fools joke: keystone dungeon chest now drops 100 pieces of loot, no matter how you key it Kappa
[4:34:15] Connectus: @imanzel the model doesn't look like retail quality so it's going to be for classic. Same for the TCG items
[4:34:22] BlueBeast33: There's nothing wrong with dual spec...
[4:34:24] rhodeos_: lmao
[4:34:25] Flikprime: :)
[4:34:26] mhgamerkid1337: when is og dk coming back
[4:34:34] Frank4LuLz: i want Heirlooms...take my money
[4:34:35] SamULJackson: imagine the scenes if they actually go through with their april fools changes LULW
[4:34:37] Anzel_1: @connectus I hope so lmao. It still looked neat
[4:34:38] weeb_dude_: i think the problem will be with specs like druids which have basically 2 specs in one, they will be redundent
[4:34:41] FatChase: But muh experience
[4:34:44] Flikprime: <3
[4:34:48] SlapaH03: people crying about everything nowadays
[4:34:55] Connectus: @imanzel yeah it does, especially since those TCG items are hard to get and expensive
[4:34:56] Malebolgea: You dont agree with madseasons points about boosts? @Towelliee
[4:34:57] rhodeos_: april fools "retail now has more than 5 weeks worth of content"
[4:34:59] dualdisk: Only passion in WoW is Towelliee!
[4:35:10] ArcaneSyntax: its a 2 hour mad season video, but he talks so slowly you can watch at 4x speed and itd be normal.
[4:35:11] grylz89: if u dont like leveling play retail
[4:35:20] tonyr23: @towelliee  see the video bellular  made of you referring to 9.1.
[4:35:29] Digitalspork: iF yOu dOnT lIkE leVeLiNg PlAy ReTaIL
[4:35:36] BackseatGM: Love me some madseason in all his r14 turbo sweat goodness
[4:35:43] Zip13: Sadge classic legion launch in 2031
[4:35:47] Digitalspork: duckKek
[4:35:48] SlapaH03: @Digitalspork LUL
[4:35:55] mhgamerkid1337: tiqqle when is of dK coming cuz I like 5he passive healing they had
[4:35:59] AirmVn: but burning crusade includes Azeroth
[4:36:00] bruhSit_farmer: the problem is, no one wants to play retail currently
[4:36:03] Alegnowar: do u think they increase level cap on beta this week?
[4:36:04] PsychoWarren: LMFAO
[4:36:04] TweakT: i dont wanna even play BC I want vanilla fresh xD
[4:36:05] love_eggplant: omg yes classic legion
[4:36:06] mhgamerkid1337: towly not tiqqle
[4:36:07] dalaraz: @Towelliee any rumours bout fresh servers sometime ?
[4:36:07] ArcaneSyntax: if you dont like the boost, dont buy it lmao
[4:36:14] AirmVn: ok ...
[4:36:15] Parthuax: We need BFA CLASSIC ASAP Kappa
[4:36:16] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[4:36:17] rhodeos_: eh it does until people start getting flying again
[4:36:20] danthepancake: but in all seriousness. People want to play a game, but want to add tons of changes to it that fundamentally changes the game and makes it a whole different thing. Its  really weird imo
[4:36:21] jessica_ohlsonsd: Blizzard will make so much money on race change/faction change $$$
[4:36:39] BackseatGM: Im boosting a paladin a hundred percent
[4:36:41] metavahn231: everyone has to buy boosts now to compete with bots its mandatory now
[4:36:43] Zip13: @parthuax Sadge maybe this time I’ll get azeroth’s champion title
[4:36:48] Daggerstry: Do I dare try to take a nap and hope I don't miss my package delivery?
[4:36:49] Folgrum: i like retail and classic, but i play retail much more. nice u got choice now, take what u like
[4:36:50] legobind: i would buy 5 if i could
[4:36:54] bruhSit_farmer: dont fumble tbc like shadowlands blizz
[4:36:56] Yazabell: for sure im gonna use it
[4:37:04] BlueBeast33: BC was definitely the only expansion that still made the entire leveling experience feel relevant, that said this is 2021 not 2007
[4:37:05] Holysal: funny thing is ppl complaining about the boost will buy it lol
[4:37:09] love_eggplant: any idea how much the boost is gonna cost?
[4:37:10] Thepilli: its time to invest in them stonks
[4:37:11] Bruizedfish: if i have LDplayer how do i join your fleet with the code
[4:37:13] mhgamerkid1337: @towelliee  are they guna add wrath to classic cuz 8 want og dk
[4:37:15] GoKu1g: im 100% paying for a boost in TBC no doubt about it, my only hard choice is which class to pick as i played Shaman, Warlock AND druid back then -.-
[4:37:23] Yazabell: got enough alts in classic so i will use the boost for that extra char
[4:37:24] bruhSit_farmer: lot of retail players might not make it to 70 even from 58 tbh
[4:37:25] rhodeos_: its do heroics..pug karazan and do PVP
[4:37:26] Alegnowar: especially becouse they are starving the retail players so hard i bet many many ppl will play tbc thanks to the boost @Towelliee
[4:37:28] grylz89: i have 6 60s in classic. no boosted at all. i love leveling in classic.
[4:37:28] Malebolgea: Eh, thats a can of worms
[4:37:35] AirmVn: how long did it take you to lvl to 64 ?
[4:37:39] oldmangamer0: I am buying a boost just because of that reason...I dont want to level up in classic
[4:37:41] Maldre: arenas are tangible for the average player
[4:37:50] AirmVn: what is your /played now ?
[4:37:52] legobind: i have done 5 lvl 60s i would sell my left nut to not have to lvl to 60 again
[4:38:07] bruhSit_farmer: alot of retail players might not make it to 70 even from 58 tbh
[4:38:19] SlapaH03: people dont know that vanilla was a massive timesink to keep the subs running LUL
[4:38:21] Kyrrua: at this point its a waste of time arguing against boost, it will bring far more players and we're talking about activision anyway ur voice don't care when its about getting a money shower
[4:38:23] growent: Hahahha
[4:38:34] jjoohhs: 58 irl? LUL
[4:38:38] love_eggplant: 58-70 is still painful true
[4:38:39] Dylan19_93: i just love the description: sweaty nerds LUL
[4:38:40] Digitalspork: "BoOsTs aRe BaD - As I pay someone to boost me with their Frost Mage" - Classic Andy's
[4:38:47] Yazabell: @legobind same her bud enough leveling in classic for me, and get that extra char that you want but don't want to level
[4:38:49] BackseatGM: Definitely finding a group of like minded people whether casual or turbo sweats is so important
[4:38:57] Alaquane: I quit after level 4
[4:39:00] Rayvon_Lunatic: i stopped caise got tired of no party finder
[4:39:04] azzurrin: Wait until Wrath, Oh boy!
[4:39:07] BubbaChubbs420: 40 for me lul
[4:39:07] rhodeos_: worst grind is the netherdrakes
[4:39:07] Cranghoul: @Digitalspork true lmao
[4:39:08] Mecabeast: I think it took me 9 weeks to level to 60 in classic
[4:39:14] Parthuax: The thing is , I agree with towelliee but, I still prefer classic or TBC compared to retail. Because the community aspect makes it more tolerable compared to retail imo
[4:39:16] dalaraz: attunements are pretty easy
[4:39:16] Flikprime: i quit after world pvp
[4:39:17] Kyrrua: attunements is just = do dungeon
[4:39:19] Malebolgea: Uhm, classic was succesfull without retail people, i dont think Bliz should start catering to them now, its bad
[4:39:24] sussyrev: crendorLurk
[4:39:25] BlueBeast33: They're more time consuming than difficult
[4:39:25] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:39:27] oldmangamer0: attunements at just time consuming
[4:39:30] alex12645: the most grind is the leveling in the start of bc
[4:39:33] Kyrrua: attunements = do you usual content, just target it
[4:39:35] oldmangamer0: there easy tho
[4:39:39] homebakedxyz: GO OFF KING
[4:39:55] zekler: dont forget that u might want a ZF run in the meanwhile xD
[4:39:56] bruhSit_farmer: tbc is pretty grindy still dude
[4:40:01] bruhSit_farmer: compared to sl
[4:40:02] Malebolgea: Oh boy
[4:40:02] Frank4LuLz: preach it brother
[4:40:04] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee leveling past 40 in classic is questing in 6 zones across both continents simultaneously
[4:40:07] twistedstick1: Wrath was better.
[4:40:08] Connectus: @Parthuax agreed, and all the pillars of a RPG are still in. Retail is stripped down and only focused on certain content aspects and threw everything into the bin. But that's my opinion, I did try Shadowlands though
[4:40:11] DrMantisTBaggin: BC was the Cod4 of RPGs
[4:40:11] Jarless: rep
[4:40:19] maccaruso: The reps are grindy for sure
[4:40:19] blade_killa: It's an mmo of course its going to be grindy
[4:40:22] Sincline387: but but mah classic.......how will they know the pain of 1-60 lol
[4:40:27] bruhSit_farmer: dailies, rep attunements ect
[4:40:30] BlueBeast33: Profession grinds can be a lot
[4:40:30] legobind: but end game grind is way better then lvling grind
[4:40:32] gravess_66: this music is getting me hyped
[4:40:32] maniac6911: a month thats all?
[4:40:37] Wardog442: @Towelliee set hearth to Shat, if you go to Silvermoon, port to UC afterwards and ghetto hearth in Scarlet Monastery.
[4:40:38] Kyrrua: #somechanges is needed for tbc, but also clearly needed for wrath anyway
[4:40:41] Alaquane: making group for heroic shattered halls, checking RIO 1200+
[4:40:42] Spaede: people in classic really seem to tie their "fun" into other peoples gameplay ie: you getting a 58 boosts effects my fun... its lame man. Im boosting like a MF'er
[4:40:43] alex12645: dungeons and dailys
[4:40:44] blade_killa: True!
[4:40:46] Aidler: I like BC but I‘m not doing it again. I‘ll watch it on your channel
[4:40:49] Bedren: The wife and I met in TBC and are coming back for TBC take our $$
[4:40:51] grylz89: TBC is bis xpac imo
[4:40:55] PatentV: atleast the grind is at max in tbc , and not getting to max
[4:40:57] Connectus: Rep grinds have always been there
[4:40:59] Phindrius: They aren't necessary in retail to unlock dungeons/heroics etc though
[4:41:02] bruhSit_farmer: true but its less hands off than retail i feel so some players will struggle with the grind
[4:41:04] Parthuax: @Connectus AMEN BROTHER. Thats the thing. Did I get bored in classic? YES. But I was still subbed for a month and was still logging in for raids and a couple of dngs each week. I don't even care about sl anymore
[4:41:09] TheBeastofCaerBannog: couple expansions? since Vanilla lol
[4:41:11] rhodeos_: the game came out 14 years ago...there is not grind for TBC, its follow a guide and watch netflix just like vanilla was..
[4:41:11] toobaked1987: Oh we retailers know all about it. Thanks PATHFINDER
[4:41:12] jjoohhs: better they are there than not
[4:41:12] metavahn231: allied race rep grind worse than anything in classic lol
[4:41:12] innuend0o: @spaede truuuuu
[4:41:12] dHinTrO: exalted caches for mounts
[4:41:18] Frosty1u1: @Spaede well said
[4:41:20] Parthuax: @Connectus Subbed for a year*
[4:41:23] BadXo: @Towelliee : what do you think 9.1 need to have to fix SL ?
[4:41:26] bruhSit_farmer: ttrue but its less hands off than retail i feel so some players will struggle with the grind
[4:41:27] BackseatGM: Who is venari for 200
[4:41:32] BlueBeast33: The profession grinds are gonna take a long time for certain things
[4:41:39] Cyberangel89: @BadXo Fix what in SL?
[4:41:40] rivuztb: I would wish in shadowlands is a rep grind that actual makes my character stronger. Now im just chilling and not logging on. Sadge
[4:41:52] Boxxss: without a boost i would not play TBC Classic. im glad they add that

[4:42:16] TweakT: its easy, just dont get a wife or kids
[4:42:17] SamULJackson: leveling in classic was fucking aids. i really thought id enjoy it but i didnt LULW
[4:42:17] rhodeos_: not the weapons tho
[4:42:19] Ramdorpser: You just described me perfectly. But now the kids are getting older, and TBC is perfect timing :D
[4:42:20] king_mike27: I was going to level a chat for tbc but I can't find any infor for eu servers
[4:42:29] ArcaneSyntax: yeah it's pretty easy.
[4:42:31] maccaruso: Very easy
[4:42:32] BlueBeast33: I would pvp
[4:42:34] legobind: pvp would be faster
[4:42:35] rhodeos_: it took me like 6 days of wsg back in the day
[4:42:35] racketpunch: There’s going to be boosts in TBC?
[4:42:35] guni1980: takes 1 day to get full set
[4:42:36] Waspire: bolth
[4:42:38] AETV: hes not wrong
[4:42:39] Connectus: It's easy, just PvP tbh
[4:42:40] alex12645: tbc pvp gear is to easy
[4:42:41] vuurmannetje: get 4 friends and pvp
[4:42:42] raptorstrick: BFA had a lot
[4:42:42] Parthuax: So basically dont get married and dont make kids if you want to enjoy classic Kappa
[4:42:44] Kyrrua: I have an active life with full time job, still manage to get 2 lvl 60 in classic and do all content except naxx tho...
[4:42:44] BadXo: @rivuztb Gearing for example, and just player engagement - guildies are quitting left and right
[4:42:44] seanb4games: Leveling in classic is ok, once. After that its cancer
[4:42:48] dalaraz: pvp is boring
[4:42:53] legobind: but then again you are horde so the ques might fuck you
[4:43:04] Connectus: A banana Kappa
[4:43:05] Cyberangel89: What needs to be fixed in SL?
[4:43:08] rhodeos_: correct
[4:43:08] Cryttan: @alex12645  no one is talking about tbc pvp gear xD
[4:43:14] grylz89: its great for tanking
[4:43:15] ezpiron_tv: @Towelliee is the boost comming in prepatch or release of tbc?
[4:43:21] Frank4LuLz: for now

[4:43:54] gravess_66: save it for a dk lol
[4:43:56] Spanos_: cast sequence macro and shaman is easy to
[4:44:00] Alkharin: lock is more fun
[4:44:04] weeb_dude_: if you go destro warlock is pretty much 1 button
[4:44:09] Bremmen: is it going to be fresh BC servers?
[4:44:17] beckett3a: isnt thunderfury good til like t5? remember seeing kungen use it in SSC
[4:44:18] Frank4LuLz: Pally with MOM
[4:44:19] DocsMistake: Im down to run MC once you hit 60 lol
[4:44:20] ezpiron_tv: @Bremmen no
[4:44:27] VictorAvalanche: better off with 1h pvp weapon then thunderfury
[4:44:29] rhodeos_: im just looking forward to a nice drunk kara run..just like old times
[4:44:31] gali5656: think the tf effect would offset the spell power weapon for threat?
[4:44:47] VictorAvalanche: spellpower>thunderfury
[4:44:50] Bremmen: so if I start leveling now to be ready for it
[4:45:06] Anubzara: In general naxx is easy, it's consumes and buffs that are the annoying part
[4:45:15] ArcaneSyntax: dont want that dumb thunderfurry anyway
[4:45:19] Thirrio: @Towelliee do you think tbc prepatch might drop earlier than expected?
[4:45:20] dalaraz: get atiesh for feral dudu :D @Towelliee
[4:45:22] DocsMistake: paladins going to be looting Azuredsong Mageblade left and right lol

[4:45:36] Kyrrua: always has been... I know Kappa
[4:45:37] maniac6911: thats what she said
[4:45:40] Zip13: What if the portal shrinks you?
[4:45:45] racketpunch: Lol someone has been to church
[4:46:03] sussyrev: Did TBC go to level 65 or 70? crendorFrog1
[4:46:09] Parthuax: @Zip13 LUL
[4:46:11] AirmVn: but this is what 90% of population will be at ( the boosted characters )
[4:46:13] Frank4LuLz: so bad KEKW
[4:46:15] markmclean24: Is that the actual gear you get or just placeholder for the moment
[4:46:20] seanb4games: lvl 70

[4:46:59] weeb_dude_: staysafe was doing it with warlock and dots
[4:47:08] Wildside1177: If I had to level the way Joker and Staysafe do I would not play wow.
[4:47:11] rhodeos_: i mean call it a hot take.. leveling in TBC is super easy..
[4:47:13] mr_zeli: @Towelliee Saw your video about shadowlands...you made some good points, keep it up
[4:47:13] Mitune: what they were doing looks so mind numbing. efficient I guess, but oof
[4:47:33] alex12645: epic ride is easy to get in tbc
[4:47:34] Brodih_: hitting 70 as early as possible is great in TBC, quests at 70 give 10ish+ gold if i remember
[4:47:35] Thirrio: think they will keep the 30 a day dungeon cap for release?
[4:47:37] AETV: TBC streamlined the questing promising quite a bit compared to Classic
[4:47:42] Sambhur: Sambhur subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months!

[4:47:51] bruhSit_farmer: it really isnt awesome lol
[4:47:52] Waspire: content content then quit......
[4:48:02] The_Swoleton: what was the xp bar towel used for classic?
[4:48:08] Frank4LuLz: boring....we want personality
[4:48:16] Bombayshow: new retail meta is 26 moonkin
[4:48:17] Bombayshow: sadly
[4:48:21] innuend0o: people pretend like leveling is a rite of passage. no, it's just boring
[4:48:35] Luxicake: theres no news danSleep
[4:48:38] KaisenSiru: YEP
[4:48:43] Bombayshow: that and virtue signaling
[4:48:43] Zip13: News = Sadge
[4:48:54] DoubleNova: the news is no news
[4:48:54] AETV: drums are an embarassment, they are handling it so poorly
[4:48:57] VegiXTV: 9.1 so far off so no exciting news :(
[4:49:07] KaisenSiru: I see something popular on reddit on a night, and the next day Wowhead has to cover it..
[4:49:16] Mecabeast: he tweeted like 11hrs ago about new vid will be put out in 1-3 days
[4:49:20] markmclean24: Wooo the boat that was stuck  in the suez canal is free
[4:49:26] Wildside1177: They should add a 10 min debuff just like Blloodlust. Problem solved.
[4:49:26] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:49:26] Frank4LuLz: release....
[4:49:50] Zip13: Don’t know why they don’t have a debuff after drums
[4:50:00] rhodeos_: only professions that matter are weapon smiths #macestuns
[4:50:18] JBonezey: Add 2 min saited, this makes all content harder
[4:50:22] Cryttan: THey should make drums usable without LW so we can make some profit off them.
[4:50:40] Cryttan: True tho
[4:50:46] MrClaudeSeaburn: What a pathetik nerd.
[4:50:52] dalaraz: people care so much man...

[4:51:03] bruhSit_farmer: ahahaha
[4:51:04] Spanos_: human ret is going to be bis now for pve
[4:51:06] forgivv: Imagine caring about seals in TBC

[4:51:23] Sithilus: imagine feeling that strongly about 80 haste
[4:51:33] sussyrev: Monke together strong
[4:51:35] JBonezey: AH drums would be smart on top of this
[4:51:53] MrClaudeSeaburn: AH drums would make alot of sense
[4:51:54] Anzel_1: I think the seal change is good.
[4:51:58] Anzel_1: blood was busted.
[4:52:00] powerfist_: Perfect Drums Usage is only a 5% raid damage increase
[4:52:17] JBonezey: drums give the entire crazy haste for the entirety of every fight
[4:52:23] PhoenixAuTv: @Towelliee i never played tbc, are dru,s as stong as shamens lust buff or is it a bit less? Chat may know?
[4:52:25] seanb4games: @powerfist_ Thats kinda a big deal tho
[4:52:27] bruhSit_farmer: imagine being a shadowlands andy, do they even exist ?!?
[4:52:29] mr_zeli: Drums were OP...everyone who played in TBC knows it...its not mini problem, it could be really bad. But I am not sure
[4:52:29] PhoenixAuTv: drums
[4:52:32] Wildside1177: So weird. Back in the day on Birning Blade server there was no "drum meta". Did anyone see this drum BS back when TBC actually came out?
[4:52:47] responsiv: ^ yes
[4:52:48] Bombayshow: what worse tbc drums or shadowland covenants ?
[4:52:49] Anzel_1: don't know, didn't play
[4:52:51] Wildside1177: This seems like private server BS.
[4:52:53] PokerFaceMoose: @PhoenixAuTv i believe part of the issue is they stack
[4:52:57] JBonezey: Drum meta wasnt a thing until Sunwell, and then it exploded on PServers
[4:53:06] powerfist_: @seanb4games it's really not. if you are wiping at 5%, you have issues outside of 'drums'.
[4:53:06] Anzel_1: I like the covenants, personally. the stories are cool.
[4:53:10] JBonezey: Just like World Buffs weren't a crazy meta in vanilla
[4:53:21] Bombayshow: imanzel story is cool but swtiching covenant is a pain the ass
[4:53:26] Bombayshow: just like drums
[4:53:27] enzancow: If people need drums that bad to clear TBC raids, that's not saying much lol The content isn't exactly going to kick the players ass. Who the fuck cares.
[4:53:35] Wildside1177: So it was private servers. They should just add a 10 minute debuff like blodlust. Blizzard over complicates everything.
[4:53:40] PhoenixAuTv: Players of today are better than players 15 years ago lets be real
[4:53:41] Anzel_1: @Bombayshow I know, I swapped my mage from NF to necro and that was rough for the first few days.
[4:53:47] JBonezey: if they unnerf TBC raids, they are going to be far harder than Vanilla raids
[4:53:56] Kyrrua: progress guilds cares, thus everyone cares for no reason. like in retail
[4:54:03] responsiv: tbc content wasnt hard back in the day wont be hard now
[4:54:03] PhoenixAuTv: You still get alot of bad players, but the good players now are really good.
[4:54:11] Bombayshow: imanzel .. im stuck without a guild and lvled kyrian things to 3. now have to switch  venthir because of codemn ....
[4:54:15] bruhSit_farmer: hard doesnt always mean enjoyable though
[4:54:17] JBonezey: Everyone is a sheep, and the meta guilds are the Sheppard
[4:54:21] bruhSit_farmer: good. games dont have to be hard
[4:54:37] metavahn231: it will be hard..for you guys, not those private server freaks though
[4:54:53] metavahn231: but even they will day 2 it
[4:54:56] bruhSit_farmer: im hard right now
[4:54:56] Bombayshow: imanzel they expect us to farm 1 covenants after another its insane
[4:55:02] Kyrrua: 99% of people aren't among the elite 1% progress (or m+ hardcore) in retail yet they still act like elitists & meta slave. always been like that
[4:55:31] Anzel_1: @Bombayshow It's really not that bad man. You just gotta dungeon grind after callings. It took me a week to get back up to renown 31 on mage. that's with minor playing.
[4:55:44] JBonezey: Yeah our retail mt is a meta whore. He is a blizz apologist too its hard to hear
[4:55:47] Bombayshow: Kyrrua I got shit on in a battle ground yesterday because i was sitting on a flag as a tank . XD
[4:55:50] seanb4games: Its the Elitist bandwagon effect. Ppl wanna feel like they are elite so they act like it even if they arent there yet
[4:56:09] bruhSit_farmer: a blizz apologist offt
[4:56:11] bruhSit_farmer: thats rough
[4:56:12] Bombayshow: imanzel the problem is anima and sanctum upgrades. Im losing 4 month of anima farming :S
[4:56:32] Bombayshow: imanzel I would change if it was only renown
[4:56:36] Wildside1177: Anyone shits on you in a BG tell them to FOAD over and over. Don;t stand for that shit from children.
[4:56:40] seanb4games: I cant deal w blizz apologists. Dont know how to hvae that convo
[4:57:03] bruhSit_farmer: daddy blizz know whats best, shadowlands best expac highest numbers ..more store mounts plz !!
[4:57:20] PhoenixAuTv: @hjo1992 Kappa
[4:57:41] Anzel_1: @Bombayshow That's true. I didn't fuck with anima but from my understanding you retain all of those if you swap back. so it's not completely gone.
[4:57:50] jediwarIock: PogChamp
[4:58:18] scenario17: just remove drums completely-hard mode
[4:58:24] Bombayshow: imanzel Really I looked online and people were saying that upgrades stays in the covenant but you have to upgrade the new one . and you wont be able to transmog what you bough in the covenant you left :S
[4:58:33] Broomba: that mage yesterday that was tanking was lol
[4:58:34] KodyTheTyger: i remember swtor ilum pvp, good times
[4:58:36] grylz89: god i wanna play tbc so bad
[4:58:47] responsiv: bc will get the subs back up
[4:59:00] grylz89: tbc willbe amazing
[4:59:01] Anzel_1: @Bombayshow Yeah but at least you can retain them in some capacity.
[4:59:02] JBonezey: TBC is superior product
[4:59:07] derElten: word
[4:59:07] vuurmannetje: lots of people leveling
[4:59:10] Exodeo_: I'm trying to lvl on classic right now
[4:59:12] Dylan19_93: 100%
[4:59:12] just_kirk_: so many people leveling now
[4:59:15] crossface123: i just started playing classic to prep for Bc lmao
[4:59:16] FresheFefe: don't see big off a tbc hype
[4:59:16] RogueBear: im leveling right now and i hadn't touched Classic in months @Towelliee
[4:59:18] PhoenixAuTv: I want bc now, literally nothing to do in shadowlands
[4:59:19] JBonezey: Elemental Shaman here I come
[4:59:19] Holysal: our server went from low to medium pop
[4:59:20] Kayonne: and a lot of botting as well lol

[4:59:28] grylz89: dude pagle is busting at the seems with players 24 7
[4:59:28] Bombayshow: imanzel Yeah I have to buy things and refund them in the new covenant -_-
[4:59:30] iblighters: The only reason I'm playing classic is to try to get to 60 before bc
[4:59:34] kokochris: I can honestly say; I play on Arthas for retail, and classic feels like double the amount of people.
[4:59:35] Dylan19_93: Gold making, preparing and lots of boosts going on for ppl rerolling
[4:59:37] Quenyaa: Been living in bug caves in Silithus since announcement

[4:59:46] solsaver12: I got bored of SL after 1 month into it
[4:59:52] EddyyBear: TBC Classic is certainly a MAJOR reason for me to return.
[4:59:54] twistedstick1: BloodTrail
[5:00:09] KodyTheTyger: should see even more people when the new races are out for prepatch, some of us are just waiting to make a shaman/pally
[5:00:10] Oce_GH0ST: Throw back to ZG :D
[5:00:11] alex12645: yes
[5:00:12] Bombayshow: Covenant made me think about stopping retail until they give ability choice to all covenants LUL
[5:00:19] grylz89: @towelliee dude pagle is busting at the seems with players 24 7
[5:00:24] Kyrrua: linked fish
[5:00:24] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee Yeah man, it's like a flat 15%
[5:00:43] Chibs243: I’ve lost interest in SL and no way I’m paying a sub to play a 14 year old game. I think my days in Azeroth are over
[5:01:02] Naicella: are the mining/herb nodes in tbc player specific or world specific?
[5:01:07] grylz89: i love pagle
[5:01:08] Bombayshow: the fight club
[5:01:08] CritcobainTV: Bro it's cold as fuck. It's 40 degrees out and our furance isn't working. I just called the landlord to come fix it LUL
[5:01:09] MrClaudeSeaburn: @Towelliee TBC is your favorite expansion?
[5:01:10] BraerHZ: is there a good east coast alternative to pagle?
[5:01:23] Quenyaa: Arcane Crystals/Thorium/other gems
[5:01:24] kokochris: @critcobain I got snow last night :)
[5:01:30] seanb4games: Im having a good time in classic, but its not for everyone
[5:01:35] maccaruso: Pagle is still super hoping.  It's lagged in SW all the time.  The Ony buff can take up to 20 mins to drop on Tuesdays.
[5:01:40] aleagues: Towellie, you thinking May to June release still?
[5:01:56] stabbity13: nodes were one of the best sources of pvp
[5:01:57] maverickjaeshiga: been leveling a warlock for that warlock tbc meta
[5:02:01] rhodeos_: the node change was WoD i think possible end of MoP
[5:02:03] Anzel_1: needs to be sooner
[5:02:06] Maldre: hope theres an extended prepatch
[5:02:20] smashwow: getting TBC before 9.1? daaamn
[5:02:25] Anzel_1: fr I want a jump start on a belf
[5:02:34] JBonezey: They never really changed TBC on retail, so it wasn't hard to convert back

[5:02:37] Daledo907: Daledo907 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:02:39] Jimroff: 6 weeks is good
[5:02:40] Naicella: oh rly gosh I thought it came earlier like tbc or wrath
[5:02:41] dazzarno: I just need enough time to level a shaman
[5:02:42] Enitzu: 4 weeks is enough
[5:02:50] unholyhoit: node change was legion, no one cared about herbalism/mining in wod because of the mine/garden
[5:02:52] gravess_66: I am curious if they take the belf/draneie boost restriction after prepatch
[5:02:54] ArcaneSyntax: there will be so many belfs in the starting zone
[5:02:56] MourvinMad: sup Gary SeemsGood
[5:03:08] NinjaGlovz: 3 months?? towDerp towDerp towDerp
[5:03:11] rhodeos_: i guess to lvl a toon, do classic gearing then hit the questing que slowly
[5:03:12] Stonefather: The same thing they are doing right now except with Draenei and Blood Elves Keepo
[5:03:13] BraerHZ: oh boy 7 ads again. see ya'll in 20m
[5:03:18] DocsMistake: Life lesson I learned last night: 30mg of edibles is too much all the same time lol
[5:03:20] gurunoni: 8 ads. smh. L8er
[5:03:24] TwoBlueCrabs: I rather play prepatch for 3 months than classic for 2 months and prepatch for 1 month
[5:03:25] thetruegodofwarr: is that with the reduced xp that comes with BC?
[5:03:34] CallMeRazzie: @Towelliee there is fun in trying new specs in Naxx as 60 with 70 talents tho
[5:03:37] BubbaChubbs420: is the level cap still 64?
[5:03:39] apollobaker: 30mg of what?
[5:03:43] ProClicker: It takes some people longer than a month to reach 60. People who have limited time to play
[5:03:48] DocsMistake: It was my birthday and I wanted to see what happened lo,.l
[5:03:56] Jargo56: this steam is full of ads
[5:04:02] rhodeos_: i had a 50mg on friday..still feeling it this mornign
[5:04:05] apollobaker: didnt hear or read, what did he take?
[5:04:12] apollobaker: 30mg of what?
[5:04:19] rhodeos_: a 30mg edible
[5:04:20] oldmangamer0: I eat 250mgs on the regular
[5:04:23] KodyTheTyger: i wonder how much it's gonna cost to get a copy of your character on the "classic era" servers upon release
[5:04:24] ArcaneSyntax: i havent gotten an ad on twitch in like 2 years
[5:04:26] DocsMistake: 30mg of THC in the gummies
[5:04:28] rhodeos_: i would assume thc
[5:04:40] itscityboy: it feels like everybody is playing classic and not retail rn.
[5:04:53] Razor9mm: idgaf how buggy it is, I want prepatch asap
[5:04:57] zechetto: How much is the XP reduction to level, really?  Like, half the time to level up 1-60?
[5:05:08] rhodeos_: like 1/4 of the time
[5:05:17] jasperboy: @zechetto 30% I think. I might be wrong
[5:05:19] psycho_scythe: @towelliee was there a pre xpac event for BC like they had for Wrath, or was it just the dark portal thing? I wonder if they’ll do the pre xpac event for wrath classic like they did back in the day in retail.
[5:05:22] KodyTheTyger: if it has to be paid, i'd be cool with 20 bucks, since i'd probably keep all my capped characters
[5:05:25] rhodeos_: it makes questing more efficient
[5:05:34] Calphurnious: @Razor9mm I haven't really been following. What's going to be new, a raid and anything else?
[5:05:41] westelan_: its been awhile since ive been on, whats the house status?
[5:05:42] Enitzu: @zechetto @ 58 its about 40k xp less. But the xp increase in quests and mob kills also helps it alot
[5:05:56] Anzel_1: anyone know if the boost to 58 is free for tbc classic players or no
[5:06:01] Kize_Gaming: @Towelliee forgive my poor memory... are the summoning stones working pre level 70 ?
[5:06:04] Aidler: It‘s pre easter holiday week...
[5:06:09] unholyhoit: Daddy Kotik needs to eat Kappa
[5:06:12] Enitzu: there was a pre patch thing for BC. It gave the tabard of the lightbringer iirc
[5:06:17] Bedren: Warrior or Shaman for TBC?  Back in the day I played a holy priest but want something different?
[5:06:24] Enitzu: or one tabard anyway not sure if that was the one

[5:40:47] neverbornlucky: Towelliee needs to put Smart RBG lightning in the room during the remodel that room. Plus a fog machine that goes off when a sub happens
[5:40:51] deliverme314: Hope for your sake we get a classic version. Best xpac ever
[5:40:53] Cyberangel89: well
[5:41:03] Cyberangel89: I had grown tired of the game before
[5:41:06] EggwithEdges: TBC is the best
[5:41:09] Puddinsnack3: @Cyberangel89 ulduar and icecrown might be the best two raids they ever made so hope you get the chacne to enjoy them
[5:41:21] tkzod: just because you don't like it, it doesn't mean others shouldn't
[5:41:22] Maldre: ooo i hope wrath classic has LFG from the start, maybe they can add LFR too
[5:41:24] Rudric_Ice: wrath best
[5:41:27] Endy253: Do you think there is a blacklist for beta and anyone that's ever been temp banned is not eligible ? I have never got into the beta and made some poor account choices when I was younger
[5:41:27] ArcaneSyntax: People really like the classes in wrath is like 80% of the reason
[5:41:31] Cyberangel89: @pat_frap I know, I cannot wait
[5:41:34] BraerHZ: i am not hype for wrath. ICC was good but Ulduar was SO overrated
[5:41:37] deliverme314: TBC was awesome, and I am incredibly excited, and obviously it is subjective opinion, but Wrath>TBC>Vanilla
[5:41:41] ghostofnappa_doom: i don't quite understand the hype for Wrath? it was the start of the downfall of sub count for a reason
[5:41:41] Felrane: lol ret was considered bad because there were so many of them. Similar to hunters. They were just fine just not top teir
[5:41:44] Vondrex: lol wrath was super cool, just the questing alone, but bc was more funnier
[5:41:47] JBonezey: The only real problem with Wrath is the lack of difficulty in the heroics and Naxx
[5:41:51] dcmaniac11: Don’t forget dalaran

[5:42:22] BRUTALIT0PS: Wrath is my second fav expansion, but more for the memories than the expansion itself
[5:42:22] FresheFefe: i think it's just most started playing in wrath
[5:42:22] Maldre: achievement farming 2.0 get all the same achievements again
[5:42:25] dead_lee_: I only played wrath during ICC patch so lich king aura confirmed
[5:42:50] tkzod: druids finally get rez in Wrath
[5:42:51] Mecabeast: death knights tho
[5:43:06] SilkeySmooth: wrath was not popular then tbc with 10m subs and seven on private servers wrath ihas more players then tbc and vanilla.classic wrath will do great with or with out you
[5:43:07] Wildside1177: Wrath and MoP had the best class design.
[5:43:10] MetallicusGaming: hey Towelliee lorewise what's your top 3?
[5:43:11] Felrane: Wrath/Cata/MoP all had good design
[5:43:11] jackjonesiii: dk was op
[5:43:14] Stonefather: MoP wasn't balanced every thing was Overpowered which made it balanced Keepo
[5:43:18] ArcaneSyntax: Wrath feels like the high point of vanilla's class design
[5:43:18] Felrane: DK wrath was soooo good
[5:43:21] Puddinsnack3: casuals weren't clearing all of the hard mode bosses + algalon in ulduar FOH with that nonsense
[5:43:35] Oriion_: Stance Dancing DKs
[5:43:36] ghostofnappa_doom: can't wait to spend 4 days questing in borean tundra, sounds so great.....
[5:43:37] Maldre: wrath is when classes first had some actual rotations for dps not just spam 2 abilties
[5:43:48] Vivelli: @MrTrebs its like watching a movie, then a sequel of that movie happens, and the original retires. You were very fond of the original movie, but cant get it anywhere except pirated versions on sketchy sites. Now the company re-releases said original movie years later. The nostalgia hit for that is huge
[5:43:49] alex12645: wrath had healers instant cast heal while moveing
[5:44:01] JBonezey: Hard mode alg wasn't defeated til Cata right?
[5:44:04] K_A_N_J_I: Wrath, the rise and fall of ARP.
[5:44:18] upperpizzapie90: ur team standing on shrooms
[5:44:24] covalent420: why didnt anyone kick that
[5:44:35] Wildside1177: People hate wrath for the changes that happened in Cata which is just nonsense. The whole "slippery slope" argument is silly. Like hating your 2nd child because of the 3rd.
[5:44:40] CritcobainTV: Towelliee wiping groups FeelsBadMan
[5:44:44] MrTrebs: @Vivelli yeah its nostalgia, then you realize oh ok, i've done this before, and quality of life is waaaaaaaay worse than the game now. idk i just dont get it
[5:45:02] BraerHZ: the only thing in wrath i truly dislike is all the use of vehicle combat. i can't stand vehicle combat.
[5:45:13] Bleedon4: Was BC when they made pally tanks as good as Warriors?
[5:45:14] MrTrebs: its not the same as a movie cause wow has moving parts. it has evolved since then
[5:45:14] Puddinsnack3: teemo chilling in the underbog

[5:45:52] Stonefather: It's a slippery slope that they haven't added DKs in TBC Classic Keepo
[5:45:56] Cryttan: black diamond slope? @Towelliee

[5:46:09] Brandonhipster: Just waiting for classic legion

[5:46:35] twistedstick1: It's a damn game.  If it doesn't work out well they can always change it.
[5:46:36] neverbornlucky: duel talents would have helped my warrior in leveling. I could have used a spec for leveling and a spec for tanking during dungeons
[5:46:38] Inharmonix: Dont get dual spec. Cause you will get pregnant and die...Kappa
[5:46:45] Bleedon4: I need my dual wield shaman like yesterday. Its crazy this does not have a release date yet
[5:46:47] Wedgeh: PogChamp
[5:46:51] Vivelli: @MrTrebs for some ppl thats enough a driving force to be vocal. It's why the movie business re-releases the same movies but in HD or with extended cuts.

[5:47:17] MackAttack1421: It used to be 1k gold, no?
[5:47:17] Doompop: i did it because i want to see this in action lol. Gonna main a prot pally @Towelliee
[5:47:20] vuurmannetje: goldsink just hurts the ones that dont have big reserves
[5:47:21] ArcaneSyntax: wasn't it 1000g in wrath?
[5:47:23] Endy253: i hope they bring it back. Ill pay 5k idc
[5:47:37] Stonefather: The best DK was when you got killed after nine years of fighting and got raised into a ghoul that was just as powerful danKEK
[5:47:49] Sollice: @elektriciteitskast endless anima farms?
[5:47:50] Cryttan: Nah man it was like 100g, casuals could afford it.
[5:47:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Towelliee you can upload to warcraft logs
[5:47:58] neverbornlucky: Warrior is a nightmare to level without switching specs. Trying to keep talents for tanking
[5:48:05] Cyberangel89: @Towelliee Just buy gold from CHinese farmers
[5:48:06] okNate: like single boosting... but twice as much?
[5:48:10] aleagues: I would pay 5g for dual spec
[5:48:12] MackAttack1421: People want Duel Spec in TBC
[5:48:15] aleagues: 5kg**
[5:48:20] KodyTheTyger: dual spec would be nice, because i was the tank in my guild in classic i could hardly play the game as I would have to respec out of fury/prot every week
[5:48:24] Folkja: neverbornlucky warrior levelling in tbc is much better, especially for prot

[5:48:43] okNate: tbc doens't need dual spec...
[5:49:01] MackAttack1421: I hated paying to switch from Holy and Disc
[5:49:08] MackAttack1421: but I did it
[5:49:18] Endy253: Vanilla needed dual spec
[5:49:40] okNate: i wish i had life-time to spend playing TBC again.  That was the last expansion i really really played and raided in.  But that rep grind was rouuuugh back then

[5:49:51] Aro725: Juggling ranks of spells is one thing i hated about class/bc
[5:49:52] Bleedon4: I never played BC when it released Im excited to play it especially with the buffs to Enhancement shaman
[5:50:02] KillaPr0: he did
[5:50:02] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:50:03] scenario17: dual spec was 1k in wrath, doubt it would be any higher than that if introduced to tbc
[5:50:24] alexdog687: I just don't get why people are so resistant to change, adding dual spec doesn't ruin the game, if you don't like it, don't use it
[5:50:25] rObEx666: vanilla talents in 2021 are just plain stupid af. everyone just googles what are the best ones and 99% uses the same
[5:50:26] neverbornlucky: Towelliee wanted Warriors in his guild I answered the call and leveled one when I wanted to play Druid. Don't Punish Me Bro  duel spec me
[5:50:31] Felrane: crusader plus aura
[5:51:07] stuarfthepally: TOC Music POG
[5:51:22] okNate: @alexdog687 it's just unnecessary.  Part of what made TBC TBC was the raid compositions that let many different specs/classes get time in raids.  No need for dual spec.  Just pay to re-spec, not game breaking
[5:51:31] firefly_on: @Sopvop i dont think thats the case

[5:53:04] alexdog687: okNate if you can change spec for different bosses, doesn't that make more classes viable then?
[5:53:07] okNate: @Sopvop lol that's not a raid.  But i used to run rep grind dungeon spam with our main warrior tank
[5:53:19] ghostofnappa_doom: i remember Heroic slapping the eff out of people but man you're getting clapped pretty hard right now
[5:53:42] okNate: @alexdog687 maybe, but it makes people less viable and less raid time because X person can just re-spec and get more loot
[5:53:44] alexdog687: I played tbc as a kid and didn't know much about min maxing, barely finished a heroic dungeon and only got to play raids on my dad's characters so I really don't know
[5:53:54] okNate: @Sopvop it's not needed.  We didn't have it in TBC and no one complained
[5:54:03] kappaday23: just imagined hearing ret OP WutFace
[5:54:38] DocsMistake: does it do holy damage?
[5:54:39] RogueBear: is avenger's shield holy or physical?
[5:54:40] Lincoln_WoW: sounds like retail avenger's shield just with a cast time
[5:54:47] AWalnutS: Imagine if seals were a 30 minute buff Kappa
[5:54:49] jackjonesiii: BM hunter OP EZ
[5:54:58] Jindo_ZG: Shadowlands
[5:55:00] ginL_: BFA they where decent right?
[5:55:01] Zip13: Pog Imagine if you had divine toll in tbc
[5:55:02] Felrane: Never op
[5:55:02] aid280: Right now?
[5:55:02] ghostofnappa_doom: divine toll kyrians right now lol
[5:55:03] Bombayshow: compared warrior ? always
[5:55:04] Oriion_: Legion
[5:55:04] Bombayshow: LUL
[5:55:05] Coox69: 3.3
[5:55:07] Iruka_Senpai: beginning legion
[5:55:08] SilkeySmooth: shadowlands rwt was op
[5:55:08] pawiq: Strongest: Legion, Cata, Wotlk, MoP
[5:55:08] okNate: @Sopvop well, no shit,  why should they pay for you to respect. lol  You pay it to respec if you want to do the dungeon.  not complicated
[5:55:11] branTVx: cata?
[5:55:14] TSquadSully: right now
[5:55:16] MrFuzzynuts420: 9.0
[5:55:17] dominikoff: People in 2006 playing protpala: casting AS, drinking before every pull. Retail palas: Cptn Murica Mode activated
[5:55:31] shortyforthewin: if i remember right the caster had too wait atleast 10 sec for the pallytank too get that threat
[5:55:34] Rudric_Ice: legion ? wrath ? shadowlands ? bfa ?
[5:55:47] okNate: @alexdog687 heh yeah TBC was my last 'hoorah' of WoW.  It was fun.  By the end i was either Raiding or Herb gathering for pots/flasks for raiding.  That was nearly all my playing time lol
[5:55:51] Zip13: Only wrath. Not in bfa or legion. You can consider hfc in WoD
[5:55:56] dominikoff: Divine Toll in tbc would be hell of a fun
[5:56:03] jackjonesiii: yes
[5:56:09] D3m0nHunt3r666: ppl asking for buffs need more paladins for that xd
[5:56:17] okNate: @Sopvop then they get another tank.  jesus christ.  Why do yo uneed your hand held and the game catered to your laziness for not acquiring gold to do the necessary respeccing?
[5:56:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah esfand said they told him they are working on it
[5:56:21] Gunfluster: its what healers been whining about since day 1 of the beta
[5:56:26] derpunch: esfand encountered it as well the other day
[5:56:31] Joostisis: Dual spec would introduce aggressive micro-management in raids. Expectations that you change specs for every boss, trash, etc. even if its just one point difference.
[5:56:40] SilkeySmooth: ret is still op in shafowlands
[5:56:44] dead_lee_: How is leveling as prot?
[5:56:49] tggamez96: I thought max lvl was 60 why are these all 63+
[5:56:50] SilkeySmooth: shadowlands
[5:56:55] silverfoxgaming71: I play a retro pally and I can stay up a long time in a fight as long as I can keep light up in order to heal every few seconds.
[5:56:56] okNate: @Joostisis exactly.  micro-managing the fun out of it
[5:57:07] okNate: @tggamez96 TBC max level was 70
[5:57:19] Pukuz: @tggamez96 that is the max level in retail and classic, this is the burning crusade beta
[5:57:26] okNate: @Sopvop that's sad y our entire guild only had one tank.  My guild didn't have that issue.
[5:57:47] CritcobainTV: Hunter FeelsBadMan
[5:57:48] okNate: @Sopvop you could aways not be lazy and entitled and go acquire the amount of gold needed to respec and not expect others to do it for you
[5:57:48] alexdog687: fled
[5:57:51] PawgersHC: Melee group with windfury totem
[5:57:53] capnkalland: rip
[5:57:55] AWalnutS: @Towelliee Do you alternate between rank 1 conceration and current ranks?
[5:58:03] shortyforthewin: hunter pulled that group i think
[5:58:09] D3m0nHunt3r666: someone must have a wild pet
[5:58:12] tggamez96: I feel like arms warriors got the biggest buff in shadowlands I feel no one played warriors till now
[5:58:15] Zip13: YEP this is fine
[5:58:24] SilkeySmooth: threat is bugged?
[5:58:27] Sydwase: Runners pulling
[5:58:27] OPwizard11: @Sopvop By forced, do you mean like no sex if you didnt raid with her ??? LULW
[5:58:28] jackjonesiii: hahahaha
[5:58:31] Pukuz: lmao
[5:58:38] Vondrex: ha
[5:58:38] dead_lee_: lmao rip
[5:58:40] neverbornlucky: Towelliee imagine how much fun it would be to have RBG lightning and a button that you could push in your room then the dogs head spinning trying to figure out what is going on
[5:58:41] Felrane: he needs to drop poison cleansing totem. He is being mana drained lol
[5:58:46] Zip13: @tggamez96 arms was good for nyalotha cause of high haste execute spam + ToM
[5:58:47] Darkb4ne_: Was lay on hands not a thing in tbc?

[5:59:18] upperpizzapie90: Fake shammy
[5:59:32] ghostofnappa_doom: The warrior might have been applying sunders which lowers enemy armor and helps you sustain threat? is the warrior sundering to help you?
[5:59:51] nhn66: OLD CLASSIC WATER FTW
[5:59:52] Crisis88: Do hunters not have misdirect in BC? Cant remember
[5:59:53] DocsMistake: yea hunter until MD is pretty spicy with threat

[6:00:20] Oriion_: You sucking on that bottle makes me horny

[6:00:48] Jesperoni: to each their own i suppose
[6:00:55] Zip13: @tigerpanda_ PepeLaugh oh no no 9.1 until August+
[6:00:55] okNate: @kamisengames you should read more.  They said their people were 'upset' because the tank asked them to pay for his respec.  If tank has to respec to tank, they should farm gold for respecs.  not tell otehr people to pay it for them because they are lazy.
[6:00:56] Crisis88: @tigerpanda_ We will probably get 9.1 by May, if they wait much longer. They will lose another 30% of subs
[6:01:13] Zip13: @crisis88 they would need to have ptr up by now
[6:01:14] AWalnutS: It gets better as you level up, dw
[6:01:17] WoW_StandalonE: lol
[6:01:19] scenario17: theres no way we get it by may
[6:01:23] capnkalland: even 9 months is to long
[6:01:24] anima189: this is blizzard we are talking about. Activision Blizzard yes they will. that or they will release completely unfinished.  stop sucking wows teet my guy
[6:01:30] Savagedave: meh at this point im already bored of 9.05
[6:01:39] CritcobainTV: EZ Clap
[6:01:44] Maldre: doesnt 9.0.5 count?
[6:01:46] JBonezey: They must have barely gotten 9.0 out and had nothing brewing.
[6:01:49] Crisis88: @Zip13 If they have do it late may we can get PTR probably around mid to late April and still be good for a late May release
[6:01:50] cahoots82: 9.0.5 didn't add any content
[6:01:53] RyanST211: 9.0.5 didnt add any content
[6:01:54] Kinghorn: shadowlands setting records baby
[6:01:58] RyanST211: yo
[6:01:59] Jesperoni: i'm honestly glad, my guild just reformed and gives me hope for CE :D
[6:02:02] mikyki: the pandemic is a scapegoat
[6:02:03] tigerpanda_: 9.0.5 zero content
[6:02:07] Savagedave: 9.05 they tried to fix the loot system but it was too late
[6:02:08] AWalnutS: so is shade taking a break or yall stilll doing reclears?
[6:02:09] kamisengames: AS a tqank main back then they paid me to respec heals or DPS or I didnt do it
[6:02:10] dead_lee_: I feel bad for the devs

[6:03:31] okNate: @kamisengames this isn't a discussion of tank to something else.  this is something else to their main tanking spec.  Y'all must have had some pretty low-pop guilds.  The guild i was in no one forced anyone to pay for their respects and blah blah blah.  They just did it because it was for the betterment of the guild at the time.
[6:03:42] Gunfluster: icecrown citadel to whatever the single dragon raid was called was 9 months or something tho 4Head
[6:03:47] duhmentia: so when are you thinking 9.1 is coming
[6:04:08] TheOfficialGimp: We can't really blame the devs for this content drought though, but at least we have Classic beta and TBC prep to keep us busy this time round
[6:04:08] maccaruso: Imagine having a hunter and losing runners....
[6:04:18] dwolf010: do you think they will cut content? like skip 9.3 so we can get to the next expac faster like what they did with WoD?
[6:04:23] pawiq: @Towelliee Nax and Ulduar break - u got 15bosses in Nax +Maly+Sarth 3d and more dungeouns - SL pales in comparision.
[6:04:29] Zip13: Pog more time for elite sets and ksm. Been taking a break for a while

[6:04:39] toffelito: Do you need any item from this dungeon?
[6:04:56] vuurmannetje: maybe he shouldve used more money for a bigger dev team instead of firing 190
[6:05:01] CritcobainTV: kings and salv

[6:09:19] JBonezey: Don't be ignant
[6:09:24] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee have you seen the new MetaGoblin video with the Cheeky boofs and other cheeky items to not vendor?
[6:09:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: by that logic new world should have been released already LUL
[6:09:31] MattJ063: sounds like time to get vaccinated and back in office for those devs
[6:09:32] Jesperoni: yeah and not everyone has an insane PC at home they have at work :D

[6:10:18] h_u_r_k_: @deliverme314 they are fixing it, but coming out with Poe 2 Kappa
[6:10:20] Lazugo: time to do a wowhead post
[6:10:21] Curtsy: @deliverme314 GGG makes 90% of their money for the league in the first week, fixing the game doesn't make money, selling packs does
[6:10:24] prismatic1111: no bad/old architecture @Towelliee
[6:10:27] Folgrum: devs are just working on other projects now on wow
[6:10:35] Folgrum: not*
[6:10:37] ghostofnappa_doom: feel bad for blizzard tbh, they are expected to keep deadlines as if we all haven't got effed by the pandemic. they are doing everything they can
[6:10:37] 無職提督: okay, bro, sure whatever he said
[6:10:38] TheVigiliance: Devs a passionate as fuck though
[6:10:40] vuurmannetje: I think its taking so long because theyre afraid of BFA 2.0 and want to do it right, but with all the systems they added theyre having a hard time making it "tick" as well as feel like a step forward
[6:10:41] CritcobainTV: @okNate bro those are two completely different things LUL
[6:10:43] mikyki: @okNate Agreed
[6:10:44] onesadkeanu: @Towelliee  imagine pretending like you know how things work lol
[6:10:47] Felrane: Isn't it because of how they are set up. Everything has to be aproved. Lots of over the shoulder work
[6:10:49] Bleedon4: Thats a dumb take unless your job was specifically made for being at home. Working from home you are missing alot of resources
[6:10:51] MattJ063: It is proven that Work From Home does cause drop in overall productivity among any job because of distractions at home.  I would never say its because people are lazy.
[6:10:52] abbosss: I'm glad I didn't have to read that LUL

[6:11:00] Maldre: why do wow devs get an excuse but as a developer for any other corporation we can get work done just fine at home
[6:11:00] maccaruso: By Nate
[6:11:05] TheKiteFlyers: my family ran a custom home building company & went out of business due to pandemic. sometimes you cannot do certain jobs from home. or key parts of it.
[6:11:10] 91Niki: Yeah, don't be disrespectful to devs.
[6:11:11] CritcobainTV: towHAMUP
[6:11:14] Layercake: LUL classic spergs complaining about no content in retail ...i don't get it
[6:11:15] Zip13: Blizzard will still liking do shift work if they get their vaccines. Just to minimize any possible contraction of being carriers (or diff strains). Work won’t return to normal for well over a year or more.
[6:11:18] SonofHorus82: damn I missed it.

[6:11:27] Ravenward: D:
[6:11:27] Savagedave: even if there was no covid, i think they would have still milked 9.0 and 9.05 basically until august
[6:11:31] Lazugo: I want to swing some bans too
[6:11:34] abbosss: the devs are passionate, its the producer that's been fucking us, and that's been happening WAAAAAY before covid
[6:11:35] Gregadeaux: is that asmon's channel?
[6:11:38] lastdeo: it is not that, a lot of companies only work from home ... devs are with no boundaries
[6:11:38] DreaGG: hope youre well
[6:11:40] 91Niki: It's a super disrespectful "opinion", that's what it is
[6:11:41] SLOCasey: Working from home does have more distractions, there is a benefit from going to an office and having the team in the same room. I miss my office actually. Love the stream
[6:11:42] Connectus: @roscodashx uuugggghhhh Bobby Kotick...
[6:11:42] dead_lee_: @abbosss Wow rude, I wasn't saying it was worse.
[6:11:45] RatEmperor: Shadowlands best xpantion
[6:11:51] anima189: the devs dont make the decisions the board and stockholders do.
[6:11:51] Connectus: The sooner Bobby Kotick is gone  the better

[6:12:15] MetaChar: NotLikeThis
[6:12:17] Wildside1177: No one can claim that WoW devs don't love this game. It is their child in a sense. I hate toxic meatheads.
[6:12:32] Connectus: @roscodashx guess it was a fire bonus Kappa
[6:12:32] Pannekaker: @Connectus That'll change exactly nothing
[6:12:33] Sharkeys: KEKW it really shouldnt be a surprise companies in the US may have struggled shitting to a constant work from home situation.
[6:12:36] SaltySandman__: @Connectus That will change everything kekw. As if there would not another greedy boss up there then ...
[6:12:38] abbosss: devs wouldn't be there if they didn't care about the game
[6:12:42] Sharkeys: shifting*

[6:12:58] Connectus: I'm not saying it'll change anything, he just disgusts me firing ppl and then taking a 200m bonus MingLee
[6:12:59] Bleedon4: Most of the problems that stem from game companies like EA. Is the top brass that causes alot of issues with marketing and deadlines
[6:13:08] DreaGG: dreageEeveepepehands
[6:13:08] Bleedon4: Not the devs themselves
[6:13:10] Connectus: The best thing for Blizz to do is get out of Activision's greedy hands
[6:13:12] Ravenward: EZ
[6:13:17] CardinalTX: I wish I could work from home......I work grocery retail and havent missed a day
[6:13:17] lukaskar: damn I miss BC
[6:13:21] anima189: @connectus bro thats litteraly majority of big companies.
[6:13:25] Felrane: the broken mp5 really hurts
[6:13:28] Pannekaker: @Connectus He didn't fire them and the board gave him the stock bonus
[6:13:30] Zzerk69: Whats the matter with Shadowlands I think its been really good.
[6:13:34] Curtsy: @abbosss While I do agree with this, being a dev is like any other job, there are for sure people who only view it as a job and don't care about the game itself
[6:13:44] shimwood: Imagine if you didn't get paid because a coworker got fired LuL
[6:13:45] mikyki: true
[6:13:52] zackyton: doesn't mean that i cant  think its shitty, even if it happens all the time
[6:13:54] Wildside1177: Late stage capitalism. It is going to happen a lot more.
[6:13:57] nintendyoh: just because it's an everyday thing and normal doesn;t make it right.
[6:13:59] Twistedmetals: no its 200 million part thats the big deal
[6:14:01] plumpus81: Hey guys. About to go into the maw for some daily quests. /wrists.
[6:14:06] DreaGG: true true
[6:14:06] abbosss: @curtsy fair, but the only reason I say that is because of the heinous treatment we've all heard they have to deal with, but they still stay there
[6:14:12] Zerohz1: its just business as usual
[6:14:13] jxxpn: Blizzard CEO gets 200 Million
[6:14:15] abbosss: it's just new on the video game industry i guess
[6:14:16] heltvild9001: true Same shit everywhere

[6:14:31] Malnar1123: True but you can be used to it and still agree it'
[6:14:33] TheVigiliance: Don't tell them about amazon
[6:14:33] Felrane: its more that its gotten so out of control. Used to be 32x the highest paid employees. Now its 200x+
[6:14:34] Malnar1123: s a bad look
[6:14:38] ghostofnappa_doom: it's weird because weren't they Event directors and stuff , which blizzard hasn't been able to have any events going on for over a year, and they also gave those people like insane severance packages. after not having those people making them any real money over the past year
[6:14:43] maccaruso: The 200M was not connected to the layoffs.  It was poor optics though
[6:14:43] danthepancake: just because it isnt a blizz specific problem doesnt mean that you should just brush it under the carpet lol
[6:14:43] michiganbrownie: general motors has entered the chat
[6:14:44] salty37_: its greed
[6:14:45] Pannekaker: He also didn't get 200 million in cash
[6:14:46] lukaskar: @Towelliee that is correct, but I would say that timing of it was bad as hell
[6:14:48] vuurmannetje: it does reduce the amount of good talent that applies to their positions tho
[6:14:49] Curtsy: @abbosss Yes sure, but being treated like shit and staying at a job is usually a "I need to pay rent" thing and not a "I love this game" thing
[6:14:51] ForTheSchmitt: Thanks Obama! 😂😜
[6:14:51] scenario17: @Towelliee people are probably overlooking that devs are working from home, they also took on the responsibility of taking care of their kids all day, dealing with family, covid, etc.
[6:14:53] Glozki: it's business that's how it works
[6:14:55] wetfarts99: Can anyone make a decent MMO and put WOW to bed already
[6:14:57] Ravenward: doesn't maske it any better just cause it's Blizzard
[6:14:59] Maldre: my god chat is like 12 years old
[6:14:59] Kahoolo: Do you think they would pull a 9.06 or some shit?
[6:14:59] abbosss: it's a game tho dude, he doesn't need 200ml
[6:15:01] nintendyoh: Yeah, it shouldn't be brushed off just because it's Blizzard.
[6:15:03] jxxpn: Its called greed.
[6:15:09] BraerHZ: the prevalence of an issue doesn't make an instance of an issue any less important
[6:15:11] Voodoomanc3r: That will most likely become much more normal with AI and machinery taking over more jobs in the near future aswell
[6:15:13] heltvild9001: suck but it's business
[6:15:14] kamisengames: What if it was Riot games? we most likely would not care
[6:15:16] Aidler: everywhere the same doesn‘t mean you can‘t complain about it. because it is wrong everytime
[6:15:28] GiraffeHydra_: Its shit that it happens in every case lol
[6:15:29] pokerigo: fuck bobby tho :P lol
[6:15:29] S1appadabass: @Towelliee that sweet sweet Late-Stage Capitalism baby
[6:15:30] Gunfluster: its a pretty big dick move to lay off a bunch of employes when the company is making record profits tho
[6:15:31] Savagedave: they breathed a little too heavy on  WWs sadge
[6:15:33] Zettabyte: truth dot com Kappa
[6:15:36] Curtsy: It being a game doesn't matter, this is a business that sells a consumer product for money. Stop viewing it as "just a game"
[6:15:38] abbosss: @curtsy they get paid shit tho, they could find another job seeing all these new indie companies popping up needing devs, ashes of creation to start
[6:15:38] daftnatetv: just because it happens all the time, doesnt make in an acceptable thing though. You're right, it's common as fuck, but that's the problem.
[6:15:40] Layercake: LUL Fix ferals Bobby

[6:15:47] anima189: and people need to stop acting like they care. yall still sub to blizz. remember free Hong Kong. that lasted how long then they announced SL. and here we are
[6:15:47] MackAttack1421: Why is it dickish? If there is no work for them why would you keep them?
[6:15:51] Katalystgb: Hes a plane with epstein kinda guy
[6:15:52] WhataboutZoidberg: I mean when the investors are also pissed at him, it is a problem
[6:15:52] ghostofnappa_doom: if you're a business owner and a part of your business isn't making you money, you're a bad business owner if you keep those people employed tbh
[6:15:53] nintendyoh: Maybe he just fired all the home workers that were lazy :/
[6:15:55] Jakesterz666: give back titanforging
[6:15:55] jackjonesiii: how many Choppers you need Bobby
[6:15:56] jimmix12: bobby get its all LUL
[6:15:58] Connectus: Yeah I understand. I also know  that it's not just Blizz or Activision. But meh, it makes me salty because I hate how Blizz changed MingLee
[6:16:01] abbosss: hes got a jet-yacht
[6:16:02] MackAttack1421: If they need workers they will hire them
[6:16:05] imsoosleepy: To me the Blizzard side of the company is still passionate to the game its the Activision side that has all the greed, its only since Activision came along that the greed has really started
[6:16:07] the_general01: what is the cap on Yachts?
[6:16:07] Sarbanes93: say the same thing about Hal Steinbrenner when he doesnt go out and get the best FA
[6:16:11] mikyki: people cant accept reality
[6:16:11] Layercake: A yacht made of tinny yachts
[6:16:12] michiganbrownie: he looks like a well done steak kinda guy
[6:16:12] Curtsy: @abbosss Yes, and people being paid shit still need to keep their jobs. The job marketplace isn't as simple as "find another job"
[6:16:13] Layercake: LUL
[6:16:13] Reddevc: it does LUL

[6:16:21] Redpandalol: To anyone it’s not a bad look. Company lays people off ceo makes money. It’s unfortunate to hear is all. You can understand that’s the world but still not be pleased or apathetic to it.
[6:16:22] Vivelli: it shouldnt be the accepted norm

[6:17:00] Pannekaker: @HomeRunJack I think a main reason a lot of people are mad about it is that often the store mounts are way cooler than the mounts you can get in the game

[8:10:13] ghostofnappa_doom: i think brd only gets hate because those pug groups that go south at angerforge and turn into  4 hour runs
[8:10:14] YardRage: BRD was pretty epic, pugs didn't have the stamina for it though
[8:10:15] oldmangamer0: BRD is amazing
[8:10:17] TweakT: they should make more BRD's but they wont
[8:10:20] ybvisible: Doing it live
[8:10:20] Mitune: it gets hate due to the grind people did for that one chest
[8:10:22] ghostofnappa_doom: Once you do that run back 2-3 times you won't feel so good
[8:10:24] shimwood: Swipe right!
[8:10:30] Felrane: BRD was amazing. They should make a mythic+ version if it

[9:29:17] dozilla: 4 days with a sore arm with the Moderna shot
[9:29:19] Wildside1177: Just remember you are not sick. It is just your immune system's response making you feel unwell.
[9:29:22] honus03: I didnt feel crap after my first shot.  I get my 2nd in 3 weeks.  Moderna
[9:29:23] TilL3y: doesn't that mean you have a good immune system?

[9:30:24] theayybe: my mans always looks like he just woke up from a fat nap
[9:30:29] Nerendis: You aren't immune, but if you get sick it's more like a cold/flue - no hospitalizations from people who have both shots and get covid @SagaXLR
[9:30:34] Wildside1177: @SagaXLR That is the whole point. It makes you far less likely to catch it and if you get it the infection is far less sever.
[9:30:38] Velkhaan: Meanwhile in france we are still like only 2 milions with two shots, we are so slow, insane...
[9:30:41] Exusprime: @SagaXLR Do research rather than ask random people. And no it doesnt make u immune
[9:30:41] birdehh87: @sagaxlr  no you can still get COVID, even with the vaccine
