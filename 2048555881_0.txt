[1:40:39] n0s0upbr0: I’d definitely last whole pull
[1:40:49] oneshotelitee: @diamondipa  I took an long break and I really enjoy this season . Unless your a healer then play SOD 😂
[1:41:31] abbutv1: @n0s0upbr0 keep dreaming lil bro
[1:42:14] Cyberkaia_: magine thinking that a guy whose salary depends on knowledge of the game, doesn't know about it.

[1:48:56] UsedRuggs: outlaw rogues have nothing to say about defensive balance
[1:49:32] oneshotelitee: 😂😂😂
[1:49:33] Kazoooie: ele defensive situation is just downright criminal
[1:49:55] Cruzerthebruzer: How come whenever I come in this stream you have this "You have died. Release to the nearest graveyard?" on your screen is that a bug
[1:50:04] juno_sha: How come whenever I come in this stream you have this "You have died. Release to the nearest graveyard?" on your screen is that a bug

[1:52:21] Chewbaccaw: grazt dude
[1:52:38] danellos: Season 3 is not bad
[1:52:42] danellos: I think A tier is fair
[1:52:43] rvel: what was the ranking for s1 and s2?
[1:52:53] Kazoooie: what feels awful is pressing every defensive and consumable at the right times and still dying cause you play a paper class and get chosen by mechanics multiple times
[1:53:18] chrono_za: dorki do a viewer raid so i can steal your trinket donki
[1:53:21] aelysqt: i missed it earlier why is smbg f tier ?
[1:53:27] Cruzerthebruzer: UNDERROT IN S?
[1:53:30] Cruzerthebruzer: LAUGH MY ASS OFF
[1:53:31] Cruzerthebruzer: HAHAHAHA
[1:53:35] danellos: Underrot was sick
[1:53:40] juno_sha: This list is trash
[1:53:42] juno_sha: Madge
[1:53:43] Cruzerthebruzer: Maybe it was way different before it came back
[1:53:46] Cruzerthebruzer: but that dungeon is mid af
[1:53:51] nightbreeze93: so trash Smadge
[1:54:00] aelysqt: was it cause smbg was way easier compared to the rest of the dungeons that season ?
[1:54:01] rvel: why is smbg F?
[1:54:24] oneshotelitee: Wait so there are new dungs every season?
[1:54:32] nightbreeze93: i think smbg is F because it's kinda boring and all key pushers and weekly keyers were stuck in it forever
[1:54:37] aelysqt: @oneshotelitee they usually change / bring back old ones now
[1:54:58] Chewbaccaw: smbg worm boss sucked
[1:55:00] Cruzerthebruzer: @rvel That place fucking stinks is why
[1:55:03] Chewbaccaw: snoozer of a boss
[1:55:06] Cruzerthebruzer: last boss scaled really bad too
[1:55:12] aelysqt: smbg was super boring tbh
[1:55:14] Cruzerthebruzer: and the eles were bad
[1:55:17] Cruzerthebruzer: almost all the trash was shit
[1:55:25] oneshotelitee: @aelysxo  fuck thanks here I was thinking I could just facerol next season 😂, I was stuck on a pvp rock 😂
[1:55:39] Cruzerthebruzer: tindral is way better than fyrakk
[1:55:45] Cruzerthebruzer: And it's not close
[1:55:50] Cruzerthebruzer: fyrakk is some ass
[1:56:43] rvel: @Cruzerthebruzer i liked smbg
[1:56:55] Galarian_Hp: Tindral is a boss
[1:56:59] Cruzerthebruzer: @rvel If that dungeon was way harder would you have still liked it
[1:57:12] rvel: harder how
[1:57:19] oneshotelitee: @cruzerthebruzer I don't know man tind has ended so many guilds where fyrakk looks like they get it down with less pulls
[1:57:21] Cruzerthebruzer: Like the key level is just -2 from whatever it was
[1:57:37] Cruzerthebruzer: I think a lot of people like smbg and court and stuff because they're just easy
[1:57:42] Cruzerthebruzer: not cause they're designed well
[1:57:48] Cruzerthebruzer: same with like junkyard
[1:57:55] HarveyPls: court was charming imo
[1:57:57] Cruzerthebruzer: junkyard has more going for it though
[1:58:08] HarveyPls: some dungeons are just cool
[1:58:18] IAmRhys1: can i see your feral gear?
[1:58:25] aelysqt: yea smbg was easy but not rlly fun

[1:59:27] juno_sha: RAGEY
[2:01:28] Cruzerthebruzer: that's for sure a good chance
[2:01:29] Cruzerthebruzer: change
[2:02:24] oneshotelitee: Your making this feral look like meta 😂😂😂
[2:03:17] Galarian_Hp: Growl changed it a couple of days ago
[2:03:24] nightbreeze93: it's literally brand new max
[2:03:32] danellos: I mean, because healers need to see more information on their UI than the average player lol
