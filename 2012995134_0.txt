[1:08:47] LingWinny: How so ? It's literally beaming after 3 rounds...
[1:08:54] Childishh_Brandino: Unneeded complaints on the game will change this game and it will be ruined then no one will play it but the sweats that love it
[1:09:01] LingWinny: The AK is wayyyyy more scuffed recoil wise
[1:09:05] eumo_: Jakeyboy1052009 its not what u meant though is it, ur playing on a religious stereotype and being a bigot
[1:09:06] Kurohige716: i dont see potential for this game. gonna die imo
[1:09:07] LingWinny: as it should be
[1:09:12] kira_123_123: rounds look tougher right?
[1:09:13] elephantlover37: @Jakeyboy1052009 im overwatch
[1:09:14] NivekE: @LingWinny It feels too random
[1:09:21] YvngYeeter: Is this better than valorant?
[1:09:24] exelexa: @Kurohige716 its all up to the devs
[1:09:27] lineupthrower: @YvngYeeter lmaooo
[1:09:29] mebovsky: @NivekE literally an s recoil pattern
[1:09:34] mt_abd132: @kurohige716 no one asked
[1:09:35] FiveToesTwoFeet: @eumo_ and hiding behind being sensitive liek hes not completely miscontrsuing something
[1:09:41] LingWinny: @LingWinny yea, it goes left and right... I don't agree with Wiked towards the SCAR (FCAR)
[1:09:42] AstroStoleMars: @YvngYeeter everything is better than valorant lol
[1:09:46] mj__unknown: @Sheniquo I wouldn't say it, doesn't feel overwatch to me
[1:09:49] QroCop: The battlepass progression is not bad in this gane
[1:09:51] Kurohige716: @mt_abd132 dont talk to me
[1:09:55] RevenantNeverDies2009: @elephantlover37 my favourite part of the stream was when elephantlover37 said "its overwatching time" and overwatched all over the enemy team it was so awesome
[1:10:00] LingWinny: The FCAR, when you hit your shots it's much better
[1:10:02] Rehlmsy: @shroud merry christmas shroud
[1:10:05] H_4_L_L: is this ranked ?
[1:10:12] asapmango234: if it was like overwatch i would have fucking hated this game

[1:10:15] jnkhed_: shrouds beard makes it look like he just ate a bowl of chocolate ice cream.

[1:10:18] kuvikfromkanto: @h_4_l_l yes
[1:10:20] WetClicks: @AstroStoleMars the anti cheat isnt better
[1:10:24] flawwley: @heycrest I think it will last pretty good if they keep adding content, so far devs are doing amazing. there are some broken techs in each class but I think it gives the right amount of chaos and this game is all about that
[1:10:28] Childishh_Brandino: @lingwinny til you have to reload mid fight when someone runs up on you
[1:10:31] counseen: the fcar has a higher headahot multiplier i outgun aks all the time
[1:10:36] H_4_L_L: tx @kuvikfromkanto
[1:10:38] mt_abd132: @kurohige716 then why you talking ?

[1:11:16] vandamas: hey guys when i try to instal orgin on win 11 i get error code20.403 any solutions how should i install it?
[1:11:17] FiveToesTwoFeet: @eumo_ exactly its just why even say something if you dont even know what it means, and he spelled it wrong, pure ignorance
[1:11:18] RevenantNeverDies2009: @bobjustgotyeeted but c4 nuke outperforms every other strat because it kills everything

[1:12:56] RevenantNeverDies2009: <3 <3
[1:12:56] icebear001: The ak has it¬¥s trade off (the recoil etc.) Therefore you have more shots. So be it. Let things be different. And learn the pattern of the gun if you want. I see big potential like tf2. Just makes fun. With three parties its other then cs etc. There is always a part in it which you cant plan.
[1:13:02] DubOfficial: @shroud Merry Christmas Shroud!
[1:13:02] Harvington_: when even shroud is playing heavy you know light sucks ass and these devs dont know what they are doing

[1:18:59] RevenantNeverDies2009: @BiggPuppa rocket launcher vs person
[1:19:00] SugoLife: I play it both on console and PC, ttk not that high, similar to apex and depend on classes
[1:19:09] Deftaly: @QroCop I like it like this tho, the teamplay in ranked is quite fun (except if they abuse the c4 barrels all the way every milisecond)
[1:19:11] mebovsky: nuke is not balanced

[1:50:34] hungover42069: @knutsbaldsp0t I cannot explain this to you in simpler terms. That 7k I mentioned is an amalgam of views and subs. To maintain a 1k average you have a lot more people tuning in than 1k to maintain that as an average. The same 1k who watched yesterday are probably not the same 1k who watch today, only some overlap there. I never mentioned peak viewership.
[1:50:43] babyydemon_: @x424 is this ranked/tournament? Maybe their maps are diff to quick cash

[1:53:39] hungover42069: @knutsbaldsp0t you said a sub is not worth as much as a viewer watching ads and that is not accurate. 7k per 1k viewers would be 7$ per. But to maintain a 1k stable viewership you need to 2-3k viewers as a rough estimate. Which lowers that amount to 3.5 or less per viewer. Therefore a 5$ sub is worth more
[1:53:55] shiroisuisei: the armchair streamers are still yappin
[1:53:56] stuhbs: shroud what keyboard style are you using? Tactile, clicky or linear?

[2:49:10] chatty_patty93: @shroud are traditional shooters like this comparable to cs?
[2:49:26] DasGrischa: @sloppychocobo he plays the heavy class, it's the slowest one
[2:49:32] HarunCTN94: damn did you find out just now, 3 shots and 1 melee resets the mag
[2:49:53] mogolous: @chatty_patty93 No, movement is much different in this game and so is the gun play.
[2:50:01] shin_hong: EZ Û†ÄÄ
[2:50:01] florusRL: @Spyke_ZGZ it is tough though, the only way to stop MOST cheaters is with kernel level anticheat, but alot of people dont want that on their PC
