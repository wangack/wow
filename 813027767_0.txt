[12:10:36] kriticoal: finally got into stormrage LUL

[28:02:25] TheBetterDavid: But then it's like you're storing away your parents..... Constant guilt. I'd rather just keep it totally separate.

[28:02:51] Molvonos: Oh yea, I know. My brother and his family too. I'm too private. Me and my cats are fine without having people pop in.

[28:07:20] xluckydawgx: I worked in model home communties, most of the time, if you come with a pre approval and are ready, that "wait list" doesnt mean anything
[28:07:46] xluckydawgx: Ah for closing costs and incentives
[28:07:48] Ariea_Whisper: It’s the same way here in Jersey, most home lots are sold out before they even start
[28:08:17] Thunderbrew: I got pre-approved and then went looking.
[28:08:25] mgweirdo: I just got pre-approved with my own lender. don't need to help them earn their kickbacks
[28:08:26] xluckydawgx: Negotiate, we had 3 lenders but if someone came to us with a preapproval we would negotiage with our VP and get it done

[29:12:27] Venkxx: I don't like sylvanas either, but think about it this way, if it weren't for her, no one could enjoy their "death" in azeroth, because the shadowlands were ruled by the jailer, and because of her we can put it back the way it should be
[29:12:28] Assimilco: plot twist this is all due to arthas ghost escaping the maw and manipulating everyone to release the jailer and cause havoc on azeroth again

[32:31:06] bigdaddyslade81: Was there any updates in regards to the Allied races system , do you have to still go back and grind out the Rep and quests for them
[32:31:06] Supers18: and the maw
[32:31:07] Mambbaa: its almost like blizzard listened to the community
[32:31:11] brozzy: i cant stand all the RP in SL
[32:31:11] Erthelmi: Do much RP following etc. sucks
[32:31:12] Murlocz: Oribos is fucking beautiful, but terrible to walk in
[32:31:12] XshadowturkeyX: i love oribos
[32:31:13] NAILED_it_wow: Oribos > Dazor
[32:31:15] ceeotter: ya the way its designed is kind of stupid
[32:31:15] Riggoz1: I think its just the navigation people dislike
[32:31:16] Barkerisonfire: people just aren't used to things being in new places is all
[32:31:17] GinjaFett: i think im gonna try another class since the level is so low now
[32:31:18] Kriven: I hate oribos
[32:31:19] pally2017: it would be nice to just get into the game to play but blizz blows

[32:31:25] JrocThaGreat: once you figure it out its simple to navigate
[32:31:25] Thunderbrew: I love Orobos compared to the Horde City in BfA. Huge improvement.
[32:31:28] MrGattz: to much empty space
[32:31:31] drunch85: Oribos is ok... just de dismount is horrible
[32:31:33] ZiggyJZ_: We can get the Goblins in there to tweak the city a little bit
[32:31:34] mur0c: i really like the flying from oribos it's so fast
[32:31:34] Shrenko: yeah its way better than Ataldazar
[32:31:36] snakebitt: cant be worse than undercity
[32:31:38] MrGattz: its beautiful, but its to empty
[32:31:44] Crisis88: Oribos just seems useless, you cant mount everywhere and its way too big/empty
[32:31:50] Taronn93: I love it, especially after Dazar’alor
[32:31:51] RazorKameo: if we could mount everywhere in it. it would be fine
[32:31:54] Surpriize: Arbi from halo nice cross over
[32:31:54] necowarrant: lol undercity was beautiful
[32:31:58] Abbz44: Some people are thinking of Oribos in the wrong way. I think of it like the Hub zones in Diablo 3 for each act.
[32:32:01] Kriven: its just a bland circle to me. The rest of the zones are awe inspiring and the city is just meh

[32:32:08] Phil87z: People seem to hate the maw too
[32:32:12] Celestia6: I like it but I do agree it feels a little empty at the moment. I wonder if more will be coming in future patches?
[32:32:14] brozzy: Orgos is a godd damn palace comapred to zandalr
[32:32:15] The_Mighty_MezZ: WQs are boring af
[32:32:15] Shrenko: yeah its pretty empty
[32:32:16] Thunderbrew: Players will always complain about something. It's the way of things.
[32:32:22] necowarrant: oribos is a bland nothing
[32:32:27] ZeethianDragon: you just run around and can't even mount in maw
[32:32:30] ZeethianDragon: fkn boring
[32:32:30] L4dy_Renegade: The textures and art are absolutely beautiful. Bastion is gorgeous.. I just want to run around and gather all the nodes and enjoy it.
[32:32:45] Secondbreakfasttt: it's you cannot mount everywhere in oribos, "mount,dismount,mount dismount" omg

[32:34:06] bigdaddyslade81: @Towelliee is the Allied Races system the same , do you still have to go back and grind them out
[32:34:06] Antidote4life: bastion was fun, in Maldraxxus now and someone could go ahead and just select this place and delete it
[32:34:07] NILLme: there are like 1mil layers i guess

[33:52:26] Dsevex: So should we just do story quests than dip in each zone/
[33:52:27] SeckSymbols: @DryR If that is your logic, then you had to have seen this coming as it was the exact same with BFA, Legion, WoD, MoP

[38:29:33] WeedIsMySin__: I'd like to get into WoW as a new player. Thing is i'd like to play solo untill i fully understand the game. How do you guys think WoW is as a solo experience. Is it worth investing hundreds of hours in or should i skip? Thanks
[38:30:48] aggronautdh: @HazeAbusers I re-started after a very long absence.. I think in terms of learning to play you can absolutely do it solo.. however there are aspects of the game that you might miss out on until you start grouping with others
[38:30:55] Zzorski: @HazeAbusers the game is even more geared towards solo experiences right now...you can quest alone, join dungeon groupus via a queue system.
[38:31:11] Spintaru: @Towelliee Sounds like Millhouse Manastorm?!?!
[38:31:22] DragonofWolves: same VA i think

[39:38:03] webster0990: @Chopstix2005 ooh shit thats not cool.
[39:38:08] Moiste: i missed it, is this mount from a rare spawn?
[39:38:18] meltingcheese17: man i cant wait to play sl
[39:38:20] healfritte: yeah, buit u need a item
[39:38:23] webster0990: @Chopstix2005 they should credit everyone a free month of game time imo.
[39:38:24] apopthis: @webster090990 no it was needed. made the game better
[39:38:34] talkativ: Hes pullin his goalie!
[39:38:43] CrimsonNurse: It was a 28 delay
[39:38:45] MeekPR4L: @webster090990 for what? esp during a year the world had
[39:38:51] CrimsonNurse: 28 day*
[39:39:08] webster0990: @MeekPR4L im saying instead of giving a mount for a almost month delay.
[39:39:10] zbshadow: No they shouldn't @webster090990. Don't be entitled.
[39:39:13] Tolaarn: does anyone take over for towelliee?
[39:39:25] War_kebab: what interwiev?
[39:39:49] swampt1l: his gf @Tolaarn

[39:39:53] webster0990: @zbshadow im not being entitled whatsoever, im only going off of what ive heard from people. I was basing it off of someone elses statement in chat so calm your tits xD
[39:39:57] br0fest0r: activision be like: ready = game doesnt crash
[39:39:59] War_kebab: aight
[39:40:02] Aaradin: They did a good job though this expansion is great
[39:40:05] Aaradin: glad they did delay it

[39:40:30] Slitze: nobody knew we'd have the plague this year too
[39:40:43] MeekPR4L: ^^
[39:40:50] Tolaarn: @SwapT1_ @CrimsonNurse thank you for letting me know :)
[39:40:57] webster0990: @zbshadow my point was if they are going to give people a free in game mount for compensation of time lost, why not just give a free month? same thing in the end.
[39:41:01] K_Rok: Boss learns PogChamp
[39:41:11] MemphisIX11: where waqs the trash mob at?
[39:41:14] snoo_32: morning towellie, i sleept all day and ready for night time shadowlands <3
[39:41:23] apopthis: @webster090990 Nobody has ever given anything out for a delay. That's not how it works. It's delayed because the product isnt' ready to ship. As a user and purchasing the product you don't buy it for the day it releases, you purchase it for the end product. That extra time was needed to give the consumers what they expect
[39:41:33] Aethn: Free mount costs them 0 -- game time costs them million in lost revenue
[39:41:34] The_Old_Dog_: Why do they owe a free month
[39:41:39] Kneckt: what mount did i miss
[39:41:41] Darkest_Guy: Hey @Towelliee where do you learn to craft base items for legendaries?
[39:41:55] tron_life: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[39:41:56] swampt1l: Blizzard giving free things KEKW
[39:41:58] MeekPR4L: @webster090990 pretty sure the free mount people voted on wasnt for a delay?
[39:41:58] webster0990: @apopthis I agree, i wasn't saying they owed anything to the consumers at all. Again, i was going off of someone else statement in chat.
[39:42:14] webster0990: Ahh that would make sense @MeekPR4L
[39:42:26] tron_life: PogChamp PogChamp
[39:42:42] MeekPR4L: @webster090990 Imagine going off what a random person says an defending it
[39:42:46] grizzlyhorn: damn ghuun went night fae tf
[39:43:11] Chopstix2005: @grizzlyhorn lol
[39:43:13] webster0990: @MeekPR4L lol i wasnt defending him at all. I was actually doing the opposite... calm yaself
[39:43:17] Slitze: yeered
[39:43:22] ZeethianDragon: @grizzlyhorn went female too.
[39:43:26] snoo_32: that was mythic ? that didn't seem scary at all. The mechanics seemed pretty easy to follow and understand

[41:48:03] Gadris: @Towelliee when are the base items available to make? :)
[41:48:09] Deadelus0: @Towelliee but how do you determine what's the best slot to create the legendary for? How do you know if you should create a ring or a chest piece?
