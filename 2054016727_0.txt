[0:47:56] Finiin: @Masqerader I played cyberpunk on PS5, but I want it on PC for the mods
[0:48:07] Masqerader: 7 days to die is great
[0:48:09] Mawkleonite: You should do like 1 day a week where you just play one of your steam games for a couple of hours...
[0:48:11] FireKiller13: @ermymunster hey I can at least say I was a witness to you finishing a game
[0:48:12] Mawkleonite: Just to get through them

[0:50:23] ermymunster: Fable was great but Peter Molyneaux is a bitch.
[0:50:38] GrimGoreRMW: @ermymunster 100%
[0:50:43] ermymunster: He's the creator of Fable and he ruined the series lol
[0:50:48] Finiin: he was a well know dev
[0:50:49] xluckydawgx: fuck peter molyneaux
[0:50:57] ermymunster: His ego is almost as big as Elon Muskrat's
[0:51:02] Finiin: but he always over promised with his games
[0:51:23] xluckydawgx: Its funny because he and Kojima truly were some of the first real auteurs of the gaming industry and he fucked himself out of that status
[0:51:31] Lemon_King: Peter Molyneaux had a very bad habit of over promising and under delivering after Fable.
[0:52:05] ermymunster: And whenever people would criticize Peter, he would basically turn up his nose and be like "You people are just too stupid to understand"

[2:12:50] Uttv32: cohhFA
[2:13:38] ShroudedFoxx: Just 20$ wow LUL JK
[2:14:43] sl1nky1981: Leggo for sure this run
[2:16:48] trinilime: rng and then a massive gold sink leaves a bad taste in my mouth
[2:16:58] XTDtv: yup the mop cape was a grind.
[2:17:21] Uttv32: The RNG werea ctually better in a weird way, i saw more people with ragnaros than the fyrrak axe
[2:17:35] PidiaP: This cheese guy winning everything
[2:17:46] shineypikachu2010: i think the leggo will be upgradeable in season 4
[2:17:56] jjwoodard10: most the old ones were rng
[2:17:58] Uttv32: yeah stuff from wrath became more harder to get, even the ulduar legendary
[2:18:39] jjwoodard10: the healing mace was rng from ulduar
[2:18:44] jjwoodard10: shadowmourne just wasnt
[2:19:19] trinilime: they just need to be more deterministic while not overly available like in SL
[2:19:23] rhaggs4: they said they learned lessons from the evoker leggo but this one is much worse to obtain
[2:19:31] GooseComics: The problem is, we have no visibilty of our progress for the system in place. We don't know waht the drop currency is.
[2:19:36] jjwoodard10: i think the shadowmourne was good
[2:19:46] jjwoodard10: it kept you seeing the progress
[2:19:55] Uttv32: Feel like stuff like the hunter bow and benediction from MC were more interesting and easier acces
[2:19:58] Mallaes: I want it on my DK for the novelty of it plus it's an additional mog
[2:20:08] SaintTheFirst: Destiny style, long quest chains, difficult/unique dungeons specific to the reward, then then reward
[2:20:10] GooseComics: But we like that thoug. We like to know when we're going to get our shit
[2:20:15] ThreesFG: i'd like my axe to drop on SOME calendar day....
[2:20:21] rhaggs4: the great vault is the definition of calendar loot tho so i dont get their argument
[2:20:27] GooseComics: Seems like Blizzard is still out of the loop
[2:20:35] BrownChickenBrownKow: deterministic loot will make the game even more bedge
[2:20:47] TKernel: TKernel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[2:20:52] trinilime: truth is that the current lego would work if it was less rare
[2:21:00] Masqerader: they want u to be like "this tuesday I am gonna get shit"
[2:21:02] TKernel: HeyGuys
[2:21:20] TKernel: just had to stop by to renew sub - hope you have a great day Lux <3
[2:21:31] XTDtv: it would be nice if it excluded stuff you already have.
[2:21:43] TKernel: at work, so I could complain, but nobody wants to hear it LUL
[2:22:12] shineypikachu2010: one sec reloading ui so my duck bar dont get cucked

[2:29:32] Effin_Steffin: Bring back Artifacts Kappa
[2:29:39] Daemoos6: This is what I meant, something like 2 of thse each side of TV, could add a shelf across both: https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/billy-bookcase-white-50263838/
[2:30:04] Craig0004: leveling alts wiht artifacts wasnt fun
[2:31:01] rhaggs4: not gonna lie - i miss an element of borrowed power
[2:31:21] niteknightgaymer: i loved doing alts in legion :D
[2:31:28] GooseComics: Disagree with leggo acquistion in Legion. It was actually garbage'
[2:31:33] GooseComics: Random leggo drops
[2:31:45] sazern: loved that you could get a legendary by just doing anyhting in Legion
[2:32:13] neverbornlucky: Lux shadowlands was great too I don't care what people say
[2:32:20] Daemoos6: Until you saw what the legendary actually was LUL
[2:32:21] GooseComics: sure. once they brought on the vendor, thats fine
[2:32:23] Zladar: Legion was the shit, so many secrets, things to find, the environment was looking good, the Suramar base in the cave evolving...

[2:34:43] Masqerader: legion and mop are the 2 best, DF comes 3rd for me
[2:34:44] Aggy: geez that makes me want to play my priest again
[2:34:48] xXSiebzehnXx: I played a lot of BFA

[2:40:52] Masqerader: glad u took the day, i was stuck in heroic raid and would have missed chance on paladin
[2:40:53] xXSiebzehnXx: At work. Gaming projects wise though I’m trying to finish up Palworld, then either SoD or I’ll start doing LE stuff
[2:41:01] Oddleifur: nice that sounds lovely
[2:41:15] Skulligan79: I'm just getting back into the game, I haven't played since the start of this xpac.  Are crafting professions worth doing at this point, or should I just go gatherer/gold making

[2:44:51] LesNevralgiques: what about YOU sir
[2:46:12] LesNevralgiques: Like you said, the loop will eventually kick in, so far I'm a bit lost but it's such a good exploration game that losing yourself is a greaaaaat time, compared to other survival games

[2:53:21] xXSiebzehnXx: oh there’s a reason sir Kappa
[2:53:51] Zladar: put fire on roots, it starts burning the leaves, creates a smoke and it slows time, u can react faster to mechanincs
