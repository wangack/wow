[3:59:15] unknownbudz: ya everyone said it an exploit and ita bannable
[3:59:29] unknownbudz: idk.. im just going by what people siad
[3:59:35] KodiakJedi: There's a guy that ranked to 2700 rating 2 shotting every arena
[3:59:37] unknownbudz: im by no means an expert on this subject
[3:59:42] FrostPhoenX: Its not Mastery
[3:59:52] unknownbudz: nah its some glitch they said
[3:59:53] EliBourne: no its not an exploit
[3:59:54] FrostPhoenX: They attack a creature and bug out the damage
[3:59:59] unknownbudz: its not an item
[4:00:06] KodiakJedi: no...it's not...you kill a small critter and there's a way to make that 2 million dmg hold over to the arena by entering it as you hit the creature
[4:00:08] unknownbudz: who knows more about this?
[4:00:12] Sunglassestony: It is a buggo

[4:01:57] Spart4nm4n: blizzard needs to just wipe all buff and debuff off you when entering any PVP related activities
[4:02:02] Viettz: they already hotfixed the Deathbolt bug
[4:03:13] Sunglassestony: There was a credit bug in swtor where players would farm a certain item and resell it over and over, it was an exploit. So bioware banned and reclaimed the credits.
