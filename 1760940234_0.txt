[1:28:51] KaisenSiru: As a paladin, I much prefer the paladin over the priest one, personally
[1:29:06] TwitchTheWitch: Its very huge on tauren but I kinda like it. Will hide the helm though :)
[1:29:07] stabzmcgeee: if they rework pally then they need to do dh and monk aswell IMO
[1:29:09] HoboFighter2: Lets do the same for DH, its garbage lol
[1:29:10] reggiepowa: its not a bad looking set though, they just like priest set more

[1:32:13] Duality27: @Molvonos i was talking on behalf of me, myself and I
[1:32:16] Sollice: A new spec archetype that could make the game more interesting> another tank
[1:32:20] Krazyuno: *back
[1:32:34] Molvonos: @Molvonos Dont speak in third person then.
[1:32:42] kimmo_gaming: maybe its just a scenario with spells, not a new spec for evokers
[1:32:58] Wulfgrym: bard
[1:32:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: If a bardvoker is kind of like a disc priest with doing damage to heal, that could be cool
[1:33:16] Ch0p_Su3y: shamans.. could have a quest to remember to relearn how to tap into earth elemental.. and learn how to be a Tank back
[1:33:20] gdcotton: Yeah this doesnt at all seem like a new spec, this is stupid lmao
[1:33:22] captain_khyzan: aint happening
[1:33:28] Naturalbeef: Power Infusion 2.0
[1:33:33] KaisenSiru: KEKW

[1:33:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Morgan dodged it! LUL
[1:33:58] Rulem: this is a really weird move, if true.  Sems very difficult to balance
[1:34:15] captain_khyzan: terrible article... quite trolly. game isnt designed for just a buff sepc
[1:34:17] Sollice: @ashwing_ They would still do DPS and buff the other players to do more DPS to even it out
[1:34:20] Thoriakk: We need a tank spec for evokers with big drackthyr model like guards
[1:34:30] Molvonos: Fuck no, lol
[1:34:30] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!

[1:34:46] Wulfgrym: its a bard spec
[1:34:56] GamingDad77: we think we know.....but we don't
[1:34:58] Duality27: could be just abilites added to the exsiting evokers
[1:35:00] chukudu: give me Provoker
[1:35:03] mavericks312: @Thoriakk no we dont a new fresh spec like a boosting spec would be much better
[1:35:12] Alepouditsa: i want a bard
[1:35:13] KingSlayerYotam: Seems weird not to announce it
[1:35:14] Rulem: I am not a fan at all, unless they change other specs to fulfill this new role
[1:35:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: a dragonsong
[1:35:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: A different playstyle could definitely be cool
[1:35:22] geokouts: buff cobra shot for BM Hunters
[1:35:23] soysos91: I'll wait for the blue post haha
[1:35:31] KingSlayerYotam: Like,  it should be on the front of everything
[1:35:32] remlar__: its just probably an item u give the npcs to buff them
[1:35:32] Alepouditsa: @KingSlayerYotam the are testing the waters
[1:35:38] Mecabeast: Where does it sit on the dps meter
[1:35:44] Hebrewish012: they also said no cata dungeons :D
[1:35:51] Heero_Effect: You never know this is a new blizzard.
[1:35:54] Baldarsar: @Towelliee not everything needs to be logged !!!
[1:35:57] gritbarontv: so a cookie warlock, lol
[1:36:02] Lukatoz: The amount of grief i get over my PI as a priest, bless up if this becomes real to anyone who plays it
[1:36:07] stabzmcgeee: i mean it could be talking about evokers we have now but the quest text was written before
[1:36:29] Shiz_zap: Towelliee knows!
[1:36:39] robertjordan83: @Towelliee you think they are doing it mid xpac bc it wasnt ready for launch?
[1:36:47] Arzzy: do you think they could change specs and add more if they do this in the future like changing survival to tank spec add mage tank spec or something like that? @Towelliee
[1:36:49] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWELFEB149 for just $1.49 per meal at https://strms.net/everyplate_towelliee
[1:37:01] Rulem: I am hoping the opposite happens; drop back to 10 man and get rid of raid buffs
[1:37:12] mavericks312: @robertjordan83 what are you talking about DF was fine at launch
[1:37:19] Duality27: PLEASE ME BLIZZARD!
[1:37:24] mypanceroffttv: Power infuse evoked ability
[1:37:28] Molvonos: @Rulem back to 10 man?  There was no 10 man mythiic.
[1:37:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the damage meters are the game
[1:37:49] Sollice: Also, no raid buffs all your going to get is meta classes
[1:37:56] Arzzy: i feel like survival hunter is just in the gutter all the time they need to change it like alot so tank survival would make sense kinda imo
[1:38:01] LoseAlotLuke: its not gonna happen
[1:38:01] Sollice: At least raid buffs give utility to some classes to want to take
[1:38:03] Poriand: Blizzard going to make their own meter
[1:38:04] Gaaralock: I just don't see how you can balance it for 5 and 20 man content...
[1:38:31] Rulem: @Sollice Legion didn't have any raid buffs and we see the same class stacking now as we did then
[1:38:42] LudganTV: PI the spec
[1:38:46] Shiz_zap: more of the lines of dk tank healing plus buffs and normal dps
[1:38:53] Solarwings: thats just another healer spec
[1:38:54] Molvonos: Bards, back in EQ, used to 'spellweave' in order to maintain up to seven abilities.  I used to be a mana battery, haste bot, HP Regen, Mezzer/CC to keep mobs on standby, DPS and movespeed buff to keep the flow going.  I loved it.
[1:38:57] Wulfgrym: my guess like most bard classes in game, you will end up with some big haste buffs for classes just my guess
[1:39:02] Rayzodoom: Just a tank spec that buffs allys
[1:39:08] PokerFaceMoose: if they buff enough to make up for a dps in a 5 man, does that mean they are basically 3-4 dps worth in a 20 man
[1:39:08] Manabucho: i think m+ would reform to 3 dps 1 boost 1 tank
[1:39:12] Sollice: @Sollice People hated not having raid buffs which is why Blizzard brought them back
[1:39:19] Duality27: we need tanks

[2:20:50] Aquadriel: me too, but if not, diablo takes prio
[2:20:50] Sollice: Again I think the WoW team is paying special attention Diablo because D4 is becoming more WoW like in a systems perspective and it would not surprise me if you see cross team assistance
[2:20:56] albunk: I imagine diablo doesn't have a ton of recurring revenue so they want that initial launch hype

[2:22:56] Boggogroggo: is the cross faction guild thing working on the ptr?
[2:23:04] tiktoklock: Diablo team works though
[2:23:26] dracullus: WoW and Diablo always shared ideas, just check when DIII was released and when WoW revamped telents
[2:23:28] jarilrpg: @Aquadriel its not finalized, but he was getting drake crests, which would allow you to upgrade to normal raid ilvl
[2:23:28] PigPenLen: @tiktoklock LMAO oh shit!
[2:23:39] shiftfazed: this dialy?
[2:23:41] mrrazputin: How come priest set is not paladin set ?

[2:26:26] TuRDz__: did you see all the CHAD pvpers like pika and Xaryu pissed about the changes? hilarious. its good for the game though
[2:26:32] Rudric_Ice: shit i missed it
[2:26:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Less CC in PvP
[2:26:46] TuRDz__: all the pvp changes
[2:26:50] WoWRoach: Blind > Sap
[2:26:52] jarilrpg: so it looks like if you are a non-raiding, open world Andy, you can get full normal raid ilvl
[2:26:53] Masqerader: the CC changes
[2:26:53] Inthezonewow: Thought the interrupt shit was for PVE not PVP
[2:27:03] tiktoklock: Pika and xar freaked out about the cc
[2:27:07] Evenuno: Lol they're chads because they are unhappy with changes
[2:27:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yes, rogues and mages are in shambles LUL
[2:27:12] Wcvechten: Ah, they just posted DK  tints
[2:27:31] coffee_press: Pvpers always mad over something
[2:27:45] Evenuno: Frost mages got a buffed pvp ability
[2:27:46] Davedaman26: Is it me or does Fyrakk's human form look like Ratchet and clank's Dr. Nefarious?
[2:27:53] jarilrpg: @coffee_press to be fair, so are PvEers heh
[2:27:54] Evenuno: Icy Steps
[2:27:58] TuRDz__: i mean it brings more people into the games pika and xaryu were on 8hour tangants about it
[2:28:02] TuRDz__: its good for pvp though
[2:28:04] Rudric_Ice: what happened to pvp ? im out of da loop
[2:28:11] 3V3R357: warrior set looks kinda bad ngl

[2:28:18] 3V3R357: like they forgot to color them
[2:28:41] TuRDz__: @Rudric_Ice they are gutting CC
[2:28:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Most of the CC in PvP is getting reduced by like a second, in 10.1
[2:28:56] gritbarontv: yup complete stun lock was BS.
[2:29:08] Rudric_Ice: oh shit
[2:29:10] Rudric_Ice: nice
[2:29:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: People will be able to play their characters more in PvP, it's a good thing overall
[2:29:24] Masqerader: rogues were a 2 can dine for 9.99 combo, just to op

[2:29:25] Evenuno: If orc racial doesn't get nerfed the pvp changes are ridiculous
[2:29:28] Rudric_Ice: we dont have to play ORC for every race now in pvp
[2:30:07] juicefermilk: tbf stun locking has always been their thing lol.
[2:30:12] gritbarontv: nah, they just have to be more stealthy and deadly
[2:30:14] albunk: Orc has been out of the meta for a bit, it's all about the dark iron dwarves these days
[2:30:35] mavericks312: 99% > 1%
[2:30:37] TuRDz__: well said towlie
[2:30:39] astvaldur_: word
[2:30:43] TuRDz__: its  GOOD for the game

[2:30:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah those rank 1 PvPers are always advocates for their specs
[2:31:02] Zucchey: If only the 1% would play the game, the game would be dead so yea
[2:31:02] inknik: everyone need to be upset about the ksm season 2 mount so they change it
[2:31:10] Evenuno: @rudric_ice actually if the orc racial doesn't change we will only see orcs in pvp if you look at the cc reductions orcs get a mega boost in viability
[2:31:28] 3V3R357: and warrior tier
[2:31:28] viciousmeh: CostCo Eggwichzz FTW
[2:31:29] keeindordel: THE PRIEST SHOULD BE PALADIN
[2:31:34] keeindordel: the priest tier should be paladin
[2:31:37] keeindordel: it screams paladin
[2:31:37] Wulfgrym: blizzard gets more people to play pvp and play the game in general then job well done.
[2:31:40] Masqerader: Paladin tier is deserved given their buffs
[2:31:40] snake_like: moon2A give paladins the priest tier
[2:31:45] WaverlyP15: yeah F priest, they dont deserve good tier gear
[2:31:48] Ealdfox: Paladin set should be changed to a rusted armor, to go with all their crying about it
[2:31:48] George2001k: @towelliee I think I spotted a lore Mira take with the new patch. How did those 3 dragons, Razageth’s kin new that Neltharion had betrayed the aspects and shattered their unity. Wheren’t they imprisoned by the time this betrayal at the Nightwell happened?
[2:31:57] Akermay: I thinki the paladin tier concept is good, but it's too boxy comapred to other sets, not enough shape
[2:31:57] George2001k: Mistake*
[2:32:21] WaverlyP15: everybody rage
[2:32:27] Rudric_Ice: @Evenuno i mean majority of the pvpers play orc anyways lol
[2:32:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Getting better PvP participation means less queue time in solo shuffle, they would all love that
[2:32:32] Valyanz: If I were to come back to the games what classes stand out?

[2:32:54] Evenuno: @rudric_ice and that's why most are upset
[2:33:11] Thoreya: most ppl do not play orc in pvp anymore
[2:33:27] Evenuno: I think Venruki and Cdew are the only 2 not freaking out
[2:33:28] Thoreya: they made their racial redundant now. if u look at the ladder its like 50/50 alliance horde
[2:33:32] WaverlyP15: honestly, the skin change on the KSM mount looks fine to me, but maybe make the reskin in addition to a new one
[2:33:34] Arocian: yep
[2:34:00] Arocian: gotta check out what the 99% are saying
[2:34:10] shiftfazed: why woudltn they make  the ksm mount a dragonriding mount lol
[2:34:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: True
[2:34:17] UltraKSlaya: This is why there should be a return of Visions of N'zoth and Torghast!!  Solo instances can be fun!
[2:34:22] TuRDz__: blizz had said they wanted to re-work pvp. A few of their posts in the forums hinted they were just waiting and now they are making the changes... and the !% is furious cause they thought blizz wasnt bout that action
[2:34:22] Snabido: It's like getting one guy'd as a streamer 😏
[2:34:45] albunk: @shiftfazed I'm fine with a ground mount, but they should also include some kind of dragon riding cosmetics with KSM
[2:34:48] shiftfazed: they made one for pvp the raid but not for m+
[2:34:48] Rudric_Ice: @Thoreya only top percentage of the players play dark iron majority of the players still play orc
[2:34:49] Davechapally2530: HA listening to Jimmy but not hearing Jimmy i know that line
[2:34:49] WaverlyP15: @shiftfazed thats a good point, the galdiator one is for dragon riding
[2:35:05] Wulfgrym: well the more friendly the game is to casual players i.e. the majority of players, the more people play and profits go up.
[2:35:25] WaverlyP15: dark iron dwarf and dwarf are top tier
[2:35:50] WaverlyP15: gimli has the one rign to rule them all
[2:35:53] TuRDz__: they are pissed cause now they cant de-rank and go into them 1200 brackets and CC chains into their viewer winship
[2:36:09] Davechapally2530: yea they are
[2:36:11] Neounited7: yea they are
[2:36:18] Davechapally2530: they better not fuck it up thats all i know

[2:37:15] TuRDz__: yes. 100%
[2:37:28] TuRDz__: they derank, and go "undefeated"
[2:37:39] TuRDz__: no, they start losing at the higher ranks
[2:37:43] soysos91: yeah, bully lower ranked players
[2:37:43] DatRebelGuy: farming nubs
[2:37:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: 42-0 runs start with a lousy rating, yes LUL
[2:37:45] Snabido: boredom? idk
[2:37:50] DrWafflesaurus: that's like doing M0 world tour without dying
[2:37:50] Wulfgrym: sounds like echo mythic raiding against casual guilds

[2:37:55] drewetling: beat them kids ass

[3:33:47] Steelsky_: keep in mind mind spike will cleave
[3:33:47] Boggogroggo: i think there'es a talent for making insanity generation with the ghosts
[3:33:48] Daarksyde: yeah mind flay was better builder
[3:34:21] xgorexx: The glaring issue now is they over nerfed our insanity Gen. So now it feels awful in single target.

Ive been mainly pushing my own keys, but my keys keep yoyoing up and down from 21 with only 1/5 of the keys being completed most weeks.  Should i just stop and wait for next seasons ?

[4:01:59] DrakeDuude: @Molvonos Dude, you realize you have to do a timed +17 or an untimed +19 in order to upgrade ur item to max. every item you receive below a timed +17 will not be upgradable to max. enjoy farming the same items multiple times in a row
[4:02:11] thebakeriscomingforu: sounds like a bug?
[4:02:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah rearranging, moving talents up higher, changing point costs
[4:03:14] DrakeDuude: @Molvonos here's a kicker, your doing a +18 and you fail the key and u receive the lower item level item... welp guess what you have to farm it again to get it to max
[4:03:25] kolteezmo: io gate is better
[4:03:36] DrakeDuude: only items from timed +17 or higher can be upgraded to max
[4:03:43] Thoreya: why is it better
[4:03:47] Thoreya: curious
[4:03:47] kolteezmo: yea get 2400 upgrade everything to max
[4:03:48] kolteezmo: simple
[4:03:52] Synaerio: io gate is progression
[4:03:54] EthicalHermit: Valor cap is better?
[4:03:57] Synaerio: thats why it better
[4:03:57] xHukk: @kolteezmo I'd like to hear your argument on both sides.
[4:04:10] all_the_tanks: because change is scary.
[4:04:12] Fortvila: honestly the focus on m+ is ruining wow for me
[4:04:21] Molvonos: @DrakeDuude You do that anyways in M+.  Like, you're gonna play the game anyways, you failed the key, you shouldn't get the loot you were after anyways.  Sounds like 'sky is falling' without any justification.
[4:04:26] DrakeDuude: because loot from +16's will be the lower tier
[4:04:30] dreamwalker213: God forbid you have to do the highest content for the highest gear
[4:04:33] kolteezmo: I mean getting 2400 was easy so i'm not really sure why they needed to change it. maybe i don't understand
[4:04:34] xHukk: @Fortvila Just don't play M+.  Problem solved.
[4:04:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: The state of berserk is changing for feral, they can do something similar for bear to make it better
[4:04:47] kolteezmo: thats true about uncapped valor i suppose
[4:04:52] mypanceroffttv: +17 is 415 gear
[4:04:55] mavericks312: imagine having to do the hardest content for the best gear kinda crazy

[4:05:57] DrakeDuude: every item you receive below +17 will have to be farmed again
[4:06:08] Molvonos: @Fortvila Do m+, high end pvp, or mythic raiding.
[4:06:29] DrakeDuude: ya
[4:06:31] xHukk: @Fortvila @Fortvila is that the only place to get the highest ilvl gear?

[4:08:00] keeindordel: @Towelliee  do this PotFriend
[4:08:05] Synaerio: @Hebrewish012 true as someone who only plays M+, i wish it was account wide scoring but im not messed up about it
[4:08:18] shimwood: I'd imagine they'd at least drop gold
[4:08:23] stabzmcgeee: would be wierd for them to drop nothing at all,, like everything you kill in wow drops something
[4:08:29] roflpotamus: Evoker tank inc???
[4:08:36] Molvonos: @roflpotamus lolno
[4:08:44] Fortvila: This tier has gotten me to hate most of the wow playerbase. M+ is both toxic and frusurating at the same time

[4:08:52] xHukk: @Fortvila Just because its easier, doesn't mean you "have" to do it that way.
[4:09:02] BurtMacklin410: i dont get why people are saying +17 would drop 415. That seems awfully low
[4:09:35] xHukk: @Fortvila I've had a great experience this whole expansion.  And I get that response from most people I play with.  Maybe the tier/expansion isn't the issue?
[4:09:37] UltraKSlaya: bring back torghast with loot!
[4:09:48] Synaerio: @Towelliee what would you think if they at some point made the Rogue Subtly spec a tank?

[4:09:57] shimwood: My only problem with the new gearing system is that you can spam Normal raid to max out your gear and then jump straight into Mythic. There's o reason to prog Heroic anymore
[4:10:01] CeruleanStar: the 'hero tier' for items starts at m+17
[4:10:06] Molvonos: https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23923485/developer-insights-new-upgrade-system-in-embers-of-neltharion
[4:10:07] Molvonos: ?
[4:10:13] jkitchin75: @Raioktv lets not
[4:10:13] GengaraTV: +17 doesn’t drop 415 lol it gives 415 in the vault. It drops lower ilvl gear in chests.
[4:10:17] kolteezmo: not gunna lie our guild was held back for awhile because half the raid did m+ and was stacked with gear. where as the other half was behind because they did no M+
[4:10:27] CeruleanStar: should be ilvl 428 for 17+ and heroic drops
[4:10:30] Fortvila: well i had fun the first 2 weeks into the m+ season, but took a month break and started new character, Slowly having to grind IO when ure behind the "curve" is annoying
[4:10:40] BurtMacklin410: @CeruleanStar And thats 428 not 415 thats why im confused
[4:10:50] BurtMacklin410: @CeruleanStar yeah
[4:11:25] CeruleanStar: 428 is 'hero' tier - upgradeable to 441
[4:11:25] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:11:31] DrakeDuude: it has to be a 402 item, which is is equivalent to a timed +17 now or a failed +19
[4:11:36] BurtMacklin410: So +17 drops 428?
[4:11:42] UltraKSlaya: a randomized scaleable dungeon
[4:11:54] CeruleanStar: yes +17 drops 428 - upgradable to 441
[4:11:58] Molvonos: Hopefully with this new system, they increase loot rewards.

[4:12:01] dreamwalker213: How it should be
[4:12:11] CeruleanStar: and you will NEED a 17+ DROP, lower lvl m+ drops won't upgrade as high
[4:12:29] neo1702: Champion?
[4:12:38] neo1702: What did I miss
[4:12:40] reggiepowa: @CeruleanStar lower ilvl drops can still upgrade to 438, that's not bad
[4:12:48] CeruleanStar: chamion lvl is 415-424 upgrades to 437 max
[4:13:10] green_candles: It allows you to skip dungeons without being punished
[4:13:10] reggiepowa: what level drops 415?
[4:13:17] MackPlays: If you want max u need to do harder levels why’s people crying makes sense
[4:13:29] Fortvila: I think they will slowly kill the game by "focusing" to much on the peopel with time to grind m+. Wow became a success from being a very casual friendly game
[4:13:31] Hasteplus: When is 10.1 releasing you think @towelliee ?
[4:13:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is a cool back piece, yeah

[4:13:57] thebakeriscomingforu: that back piece should be in the trading post or some faction down there.
[4:14:01] reggiepowa: @Fortvila people want to play the game, raid logging in wod is what killed the game
[4:14:01] Hasteplus: July? O_o
[4:14:12] largefromage: NotLikeThis
[4:14:18] Voltaictv: 100% month before
[4:14:18] Thoreya: thinkin before
[4:14:20] Thoreya: mid may
[4:14:23] Heero_Effect: You know what it’s gonna be April towTinfoil
[4:14:27] Hasteplus: Aha
[4:14:28] reggiepowa: @CeruleanStar do you know which key level is dropping 415 ilvl?
[4:14:29] dreamwalker213: @fortvila you can still be as casual as you want
[4:14:38] Wulfgrym: talk about sabotaging yourself if they do that
[4:14:43] Necrootide: Hopefully sooner than later
[4:14:44] oradros: unless D4 got delay for X reason
[4:14:48] GingerGambit: They said spring on the road map so it won’t be July
[4:14:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ideally I would want the race over before D4
[4:15:01] Onearmyof2: just move diablos date back
[4:15:05] Thoreya: july is way too far lol
[4:15:19] Wulfgrym: d4>race
[4:15:23] stabzmcgeee: he said before D4 not over d4
[4:15:37] Snabido: Does diablo have a pre-season period like M+ in wow?
[4:15:38] reggiepowa: wow > d4
[4:15:38] Fortvila: WoD was only considered a failure cause people stopped subbing, but the content that was there was really good and for people with limited time it was acctually nice feeling like you could raidlog and play other games
[4:15:38] Baldarsar: fuck the race
[4:15:39] TheGiant99: They are not gonna move D4 for a wow patch.
[4:15:56] Wulfgrym: move d4? ROFL
[4:16:08] jarilrpg: i just hope the patch doesnt feel rushed so they put it out before d4
[4:16:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Always degeneracy LUL
[4:16:27] MeisterPetze: ohhh wow echo will win... so you can play d4 :D
[4:16:41] MackPlays: Blizz doesn’t care about any races
[4:16:41] Voltaictv: Im a little sad Witch Doctor isnt available at launch for D4 and Ill have to wait til X season for it to release
[4:16:53] reggiepowa: I mean its not like they didnt know when wow patch would come out more or less when they were announcing d4 date
[4:17:06] dracullus: @Towelliee mid May is possible, 16th release, 23rd raid release, 30th boss die
