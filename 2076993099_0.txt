[0:30:17] mipa0501: Seems like they want to focus on endgame content
[0:30:18] 3Brick_: @Guzu last night i practiced Sm boost and used 10g for Repair costs
[0:30:18] dumpringz: means they aren't going to balance this phase

[0:30:24] Yvernaa: @Arthident hugg
[0:30:25] booddhi: i dont think so

[0:31:08] rosbaek: finding healers and tanks in SOD is rough takes sooo long ... pls not more
[0:31:10] JariMurhapuro: Imo they should give xp boost after you lvl 1 toon to max lvl, same with mount costs after you buy first mounts alt gets cheaper mounts
[0:31:11] hamcheesetoastie56: can i join your guild guzu
[0:31:13] Shreddingly: 100% exp boost is correct
[0:31:18] quatschtuetenwuerger069: na i mean its not 100% sure that lvl 50 raids gonna be 20 man
[0:31:19] Yvernaa: 40 man raids were the bestttt, I only have good memories of it in classic vanilla
[0:31:23] SunTruth1: in 20 mans, how many healers do you run usually? is it 4 or watt @Guzu
[0:31:25] chr47: Class balance in 10 man with ranged only mechanics is a shitshow
[0:31:33] kani_kani: i just wonder if it'll be 20 man with a 3 day lockout, or 20 man with a 7 day lockout
[0:31:33] Shreddingly: @amksikerim they already stated it in the bluepost though.
[0:31:38] cptnraz: Tbh most non-streamers has problems getting 2 healers for 10-man pugs haha

[0:44:56] Supibot: vahngogeta, 🤖 To keep your World of Warcraft bags clean, follow these tips: 1. **Regularly Clean and Organize**: Take some time every once in a while to clean out and organize your bags. Get rid of any items you don't need and sort things into categories for easier access. 2. **Avoid Food and Drinks**: Try to avoid eating or drinking near your computer while playing. This will help prevent any accidental spills or crumbs from getting into your bags. 3. **Use In-Game Features**: Take advantage …

[1:08:43] mjs010: @cptnraz Dang - that's way better than their first run.
[1:08:44] adam_brisbane: you can attack him if you opt out
[1:08:46] TMMOOF: you need bloods so he doesn't heal
[1:08:47] DuckjarTv: you need to have blood on you
[1:08:49] danbalanceltrist: COPIUM
[1:08:52] liorem_: SURE
[1:08:52] vahngogeta: fake news
[1:08:53] cptnraz: Yes you can
[1:08:55] Shreddingly: savix group did it in a raid and opt out of the event
[1:08:58] Yahyawow: but you can't get the blood
[1:08:58] plumpus81: you die without bloods you heal him
[1:08:58] sankos1990: but you might need bloods
[1:09:01] ScryerTV: you need bloods or he heal
[1:09:01] Shreddingly: xayru*
[1:09:01] adam_brisbane: but he heals against people who have no bloos
[1:09:02] niveous_a: lowest it got was 15%
[1:09:02] TheWhiteRabbitxX: you can attack him if you opt out, which is why the GM showed up to stop it I think
[1:09:02] step_olaf: hello there bois
[1:09:04] Foodlebar: SURE that doesnt sound fake at all
[1:09:06] chr47: People are coping so goddamn hard thinking he will drop loot
[1:09:06] liorem_: he drops frostmourne
[1:09:08] niveous_a: but that 15% was like 12mil health
[1:09:10] DuckjarTv: if he kills you without blood he will heal
[1:09:11] resume___: @Guzu Did you see a GM tanked the boss for a while?
[1:09:12] danbalanceltrist: uuh
[1:09:13] Frostlicious: at 20% he gets 14m hp. need all consumes/unboon
[1:09:16] azshare_: he will heal if you dont have blood
[1:09:20] arrkies91: @adam_brisbane thats not how u do it, u need blood for him not to heal when he attacks a player and kills it
[1:09:20] ScryerTV: he heals if no blood
[1:09:20] booddhi: he will heal without blood
[1:09:21] Yahyawow: idk man I'm kinda close to my mount
[1:09:21] drdisasterttv: they tried while being opt out, and that didn't work at all
[1:09:21] shogun2255: @guzu even Blizzard GM in his old blue garments came to second attempt
[1:09:23] ShingaTV: is the theorie atleast because they freshly scaled the boss yesterday
[1:09:23] cptnraz: Okey! Interesting :D
[1:09:24] rogueuruguayo: You playing ssf guzu?
[1:09:26] vahngogeta: bengal tiger dropped yesterday
[1:09:26] Aeil__: bengal tiger thing is complete speculation. Its just in the game files.
[1:09:32] YzieGG: like hakar
[1:09:32] ponzan: are you going to play cataclysm classicc?
[1:09:35] CamGG__: Best to watch what the NA guys did when they got it to 13%
[1:09:38] Qiima1: how ppl knows boss drop tiger mount???
[1:09:43] damnitdann1: at 20% he gained an extra 10+ million health
[1:09:45] adam_brisbane: yes that is right
[1:09:46] ShingaTV: so noone knows if its the blood infront you need or he just had to much healing at all
[1:09:47] damnitdann1: it was crazy
[1:09:47] DJspookyghost: NOTED mm mm
[1:09:49] AceOfFlame: @Guzu I think it also prevents his charge that heals him a ton
[1:09:50] DuckjarTv: yepp
[1:09:54] damnitdann1: GMs popped in and helped tank it
[1:09:57] damnitdann1: it was crazy
[1:09:59] ScryerTV: 40 raid team first for layer
[1:09:59] mjs010: Yeah, he was healing like 1m every time someone died in the attempt I watched.
[1:10:03] Cypagex: @Qiima1 Data-mined. Cant be certain it drops from the boss tho
[1:10:05] Torsoto: yo what up mr guzu

[1:10:11] NoiseCow: @ShingaTV WHo is cordinating on Ally side?

[1:10:16] Kordul: u should try to form earlier, to get ppl on the same layer
[1:10:17] adam_brisbane: first couple minutes you need to let everyone farm some bloods
[1:10:19] Djinx_o: He only Drops the mount if you kite him to Sylvanas in UC and let her Kill it
[1:10:19] resume___: @Guzu Did you see a GM tanked the boss for a while? He also used a .hp command to increase the boss' health to 67 million, I don't think it's supposed to be killed
[1:10:21] Spikeqc: FeelsDankMan
[1:10:21] Foodlebar: iAsk can i be the healer in your group mr guzu
[1:10:22] Shreddingly: how do you plan to get blood without killing other 5man teams?

[2:21:04] Valencia_Pete: @Nunadaaa but both times he had max ears though right its stuck at 255 which is also the blood cap

[2:21:55] NautilusBTW: qZv entrance?
[2:21:56] Jellooze: if having him near a blood turn in point actually changes his buff it could be that he gain hp based on blood count
[2:21:56] frederikv225: gaurd is sleeping a booty bay, then event is up so they can't
[2:21:57] WakeGG: altar does nothing

[2:22:48] ritter184: ritter184 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Have rogues all use wound poison, it's a flat amount reduction. Also chat whatever you do, don't pull Zanzil and let him spawn the totem, then evade it. It totally won't spawn hundreds of skeletons and turn the layer into a slideshow. Again, do not do this, it doesn't totally work.

[2:25:37] smithers0351: bootyy
[2:25:37] Dinomight3: he needs to turn his ears in at an altar
[2:25:38] ajchimica: they took him out to ocean yesterday night and he just full resets, full hp and runs back to zg
[2:25:40] limburgse: @micaza the guards are asleep during event they wont help you
[2:25:43] Ulmozzie: is a troll, maybe zul
[2:25:43] Nunadaaa: i mean kiting him on top of spirit resser s probably the play to keep people in the fight
[2:25:43] Sockentee: i think the Island is the only thing that wasn´t tried yet
[2:25:45] mordiell: no way
[2:25:45] Plaguethong: YES
[2:25:45] Huertix: yes

[2:25:49] Airdin93: YEP
[2:25:51] Estairria_: What about the Zandalar tribe island? @Guzu
[2:25:52] Syloa: at 10% he gets more hp again GLAMO
[2:25:53] GodOfHellfire21: the boss would roll the guards anyway
[2:25:54] kingt0s: @Guzu why are u even trying this? the purpose of the boss is only for lvl 60s to discover in future phase
[2:25:55] kasploup: he 100% can't get killed
[2:25:55] SirPhucksalot: DO you do more damage if you have 255 blood?
[2:25:55] kiffa49: 100%
[2:25:56] packtar: no I don't think so
[2:25:56] resume___: @Guzu Try to get Bad Blood as in a raid, see if he drinks it

[2:25:58] rominos88: YEP
[2:25:59] Yahyawow: 100% is
[2:25:59] SHIVQQ: or hes not meant to be killed this phase?
[2:26:01] dramajohns: I feel zg Island makes the most sense
[2:26:01] esbi__: He can be killed 100%
[2:26:02] TheSebber: i think you can
[2:26:02] omwtwopluto: It's just bad blizzard numbers, they thought 13m would be feasible imo
[2:26:02] Yvernaa: I don't think he has any purpose other than killing players
[2:26:03] ohioliving: just now finding out KEKW
[2:26:03] flyingfishrobe: HE IS REGENERATING
[2:26:04] SuperLost89: @Guzu im just saying, the arena is where the world boss went down to 50% hp in about 5 seconds near the altar there
[2:26:05] paclyy: @Guzu they were in arena but they were opted out of the event for the first try
[2:26:05] MlLKYBLAST: AAAA KEEP SWIMMING AAAA
[2:26:05] kiffa49: not a mechanic, just can’t kill him
[2:26:05] vaizaad: just to troll players
[2:26:06] crainiam: Nah
[2:26:10] sircrumpler: Would be cool if they let him die but then just instant respawn
[2:26:11] WILZoNrackcity: probably unkillable until later in p2
[2:26:11] Tugexx: Mukla island so mukla beats him?
[2:26:11] ScootSmith: get the booty bay guards to fight him too
[2:26:11] TheWhiteRabbitxX: no. you need people that aren’t spazzing out, trying to duel… like… yeah
[2:26:14] kordatier_1337: its because there are many ppl killing the others
[2:26:15] LuminescentLlama: fricc vod viewers
[2:26:16] guld1337: mathematically impossible? another wow meme
[2:26:16] kingt0s: waste of time
[2:26:16] mordiell: they would not put a huge new mob in SoD if it wasnt killable and there wasnt something to do with it
[2:26:17] Typonaa: MONKA Kha'damu dies today?
[2:26:17] SaxNViolins: more fun if it was hardcore
[2:26:18] elstebanos: gotta have something to do with those 255 stacks of ears
[2:26:20] teadanman: Kill all mages
[2:26:22] penny_lanee: lol @ it swimming in the air just there
[2:26:24] michaelhawkk: if they didnt want us to kill him, they wouldnt nerf the health
[2:26:24] big_bang_impact: The mages aren't making it so much fun
[2:26:24] Boneyards_666: his swird is cool
[2:26:25] smithers0351: BUSSERS OtterPlop
[2:26:26] resume___: I swear Bad Blood could be the key
[2:26:26] IllIllIIllIIlllIlIlIllIll: BROKEN STUPID GAME = REALLY FUN
[2:26:26] ThisIsBrutus: Seems doable with a lot more damage, maybe it was never meant to happen at level 40
[2:26:28] Boneyards_666: sword*
[2:26:29] JoaBawz: i think this boss is made to be killable for next phase, when stv event is worthless
[2:26:33] Yahyawow: its either a failsafe so he can't die or there is some form of mechanic at 20% that just needs discovering
[2:26:33] safkae: COPIUM
[2:26:34] smithers0351: crunch vp
[2:26:34] liorem_: SURE
[2:26:35] paco__gutierrez: Why the mages ae spamming that's stupid
[2:26:36] maxburty: why would GMs nerf him tho if he wasnt killable
[2:26:37] Synthez542: @guzu What if there's some big brain tech with aggrends twitter picture? https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/106860685878628352/1212766608502816788/image.png?ex=65f307eb&is=65e092eb&hm=17ce3f772caff0d98efe8fc878f5f23481212e54e9a87108935cca0976e0fd40&=&format=webp&quality=lossless
[2:26:37] craxxy_: I mean technically (without griefers) if you have a gigabear tank with 10k hp etc. he should be healable, and if you then get only ranged it would def. be possible in time - but it just won't be possible with this many griefers and melee
[2:26:38] WILZoNrackcity: he gets hp boost at 20% depending n how many kills he has
[2:26:38] kiffa49: yes they would, he’s there for raid groups… lol
[2:26:39] Valencia_Pete: i think its a troll by blizz his name is U MAD backwards KEKW
[2:26:41] mordiell: there must be a strat or an item
[2:26:42] thefearedsin: gnomish enlarger trinket from gnomer makes you just as huge as him
[2:26:42] niveous_a: @mordiell they also specifically nerfed him so i feel the devs want him to die
[2:26:45] Frostlicious: why would he have life steal etfc
[2:26:46] Nizzftw: his hp is stuck now?

[2:26:53] limburgse: @sirphucksalot  nah, you just dont heal the boss when he hits you, when he hits you without bloodstacks you will heal him
[2:26:55] Ranzorx: brother they just put retail spells into classic, they didn't think anything out this hard
[2:26:55] Imperator1v9: @Guzu More organized, more debuff uptime and most importantly a GOOD SPAWN

[2:27:17] Ignus85: @Guzu I work for mckinsey and measure fun. This is not enough fun for the people involved. You need to be more effective in creating fun.
[2:27:18] Asmii: didnt get time to read it
[2:27:18] justaround31: is it still possible to kite mobs across zones?
[2:27:19] Blufootgaming: take him to the zandalari island
[2:27:21] damnitdann1: says something about we need to work together to defeat the flood loa
[2:27:21] Yahyawow: On the flip side. Blizzard trying to get us to band together and kill the boss of an event that is already laggy as fuck is kinda trolly
[2:27:21] limburgse: BB guards are asleep during event, people are clueless
[2:27:22] Kermeous: too bad he's not on kalimdor, bring to saurfang

[2:27:30] niveous_a: @Naboo69 savixOld you're onto something
[2:27:34] JoshOTWO: only did 3% in 15  min ?
[2:27:34] SirPhucksalot: The STV trinkets do twilight damage, maybe that is whats needed?
[2:27:35] Arcinatos: even if he becomes killable it'll be because of this community event LULE

[2:27:53] ajchimica: if you had more ppl not doing aoe and helping focus boss you could get there, just a lot of downtime from griefer
[2:27:54] t1isokatleague: WORLD FIRST I WAS HERE
[2:27:54] vejitas4: Eu just give up, let Na figure out the kill like always then come back to do it
[2:27:56] Dillsmof: Take him to the big gorilla on island and maybe it'll buff the gorilla and they'll fight lol
[2:27:56] kordatier_1337: does the blood disappear after the event?
[2:27:57] omwtwopluto: That's a good idea rofl
[2:27:57] LeeshDK: rip boat
[2:27:58] Fredster9: there is no way they nerf or buff things with the boss if they don't intend it to be killed

[2:28:21] damnitdann1: honesty I think every attempt made so far could have killed him but mf keep griefing with AOE
[2:28:22] assasinatorbg: thrall vs the boss
[2:28:22] omwtwopluto: Ya u guys only have done his initial hp b4 the 20%
[2:28:28] pw_scyld: Give him the Teremus treatment - pull him to the SW throne room
[2:28:29] WildeThornberry: what if you kite him out of STV so he isn’t blood buffed
[2:28:33] Xeonik11: @guzu so not confirmed what did it but when the boys fought at arena the first time something chunked him to 50% btw
[2:28:37] damnitdann1: Stupid people won’t focus boss and want to grief everyone else
[2:28:37] frederikv225: maybe you need 5 man party's only
[2:28:37] CuppaCoffeh: I think that he is killable since they nerfed him the other day. if he was not killable why nerf him at all

[2:30:14] Deonardocilaprio: looks like he isnt taking damage anymore
[2:30:20] typy13: While you are near him, you will receive one of two debuffs depending on your proximity;      Kill, Maim, Bleed!, which triggers at a moderate distance from him.     Feast of Blood, which triggers when you're very close to him.  While these debuffs are on you, you will receive significantly increased Blood for the Blood Loa for earning killing blows on enemy players.
[2:30:23] DrHopenstein: Maybe its a mechanic like Necrotic Plague on LK... you need to get a debuff then dispell it so he gets it....

[2:33:53] zartorak: I would try and get every1 maxed out on blood
[2:33:54] Sockentee: Blizz just nerfed him... maybe they forgot about the HP increase at 20% :D
[2:33:55] somadaz: Has anyone brought him to ZG island?
[2:33:55] Epiqschwer: @Guzu drag him to ZG :D
[2:33:56] bigsugg: altar doesnt work, GM was tanking him at the altar yesterday
[2:33:56] Dovahkcin: does someone have a remove enrage or frenzy?

[2:34:06] Zyphy266: Such copium
[2:34:06] Zecxx: there is no c
[2:34:08] Zecxx: Nerdge
[2:34:09] trueroleta: sad that you cant make 2 raids groups that is togheter
[2:34:11] chr47: he is just there for a blood making buff
[2:34:13] PGTB: irriadiated?
[2:34:14] Pacci6: :o
[2:34:15] mordiell: theres about 0,5% chance they intended it as a brute force thing
[2:34:15] jigglejiggleboi: first 15 minutes of actual PVP collecting blood then attack boss for 2nd 15 minutes?
[2:34:17] buzja: oo mby
[2:34:20] Melkor_Active: @Guzu we had that yesterday. its not that no

[2:34:39] Exusprime: The set with -500 health om you'all are cooking hard
[2:34:41] phongor: maybe those new grenades
[2:34:42] o_0shak0_o: Had to work, did they kill him?
[2:34:43] resume___: @vepsee doesn't really matter, its not about damage
[2:34:43] niveous_a: @mordiell tbh if it does drop an epic mount that's 60 its probably meant to be killed a higher level
[2:34:47] makitahq: cant u opt out and still kill boss?
[2:34:49] BigJCM: just get world buffs KEKW
[2:34:53] ociriss: i find it hard to believe at how fast ppl find runes that it wouldnt have been worked out by now
[2:34:53] rall3tnewworld: yes there is
[2:34:54] realmalfurionsr: Yes
[2:34:54] niveous_a: @niveous_a but killing it now would be sick
[2:34:54] venyalorelei: @Guzu Everyone take warded so you cant kill each other
[2:34:54] Syloa: devs are just laughing their asses off right now, knowing theres no loot om

[2:34:59] Plaz_a: @niveous_a vanilla pvp war mounts were lvl 40 so it's possible to have a 40 epic one
[2:35:00] esbi__: Maybe in  front of ZG or ZG Island cuz he is collecting blood for Hakkar
[2:35:00] Trexbo_: om
[2:35:00] Rykor09: the bijou altar?

[2:35:05] zakkoncrak: I think it’s just not intended to be killed
[2:35:06] bhrowster: We have several mage groups just aoe'ing them stopping would probably help lol
[2:35:09] Arcinatos: @Syloa LULE True
[2:35:10] limburgse: @makitahq you cant, you needd bloodstacks otherwise you will heal the boss
[2:35:10] Kermeous: That'd be a cool interaction, irradiated 3 pieces causes him to take dmg instead of heal from his "Blood leech" ability
[2:35:12] WakeGG: the blood trinkets you buy with coins?
[2:35:12] realmalfurionsr: Has anyone taken him into the ZG area?
[2:35:13] mimic124: I love these

[2:35:23] Sockentee: no one did
[2:35:24] burnitdown_leon: kite ZG island

[2:35:31] omwtwopluto: I've seen it taken to like 5 different places but not the ZG altar
[2:35:31] nodnarB_: @oeoe_lord no he despawns
[2:35:34] Exophalic: oh fk off
[2:35:36] mrbluesky1337: sounds like some godzilla shit
[2:35:36] ThisIsBrutus: Maybe the amount of blood in his vicinity below 20% will decrease HP / increase damage?
[2:35:37] Airdin93: try get like 100 blood stacks before attempting the boss
[2:35:37] eaksyn: way too far away from any altar spawns
[2:35:38] esbi__: @GodOfHellfire21 He despawns outside STV
[2:35:42] frederikv225: no one have done that a that place
[2:35:43] Plaguethong: You have to kite him to the bengal tiger STV cave KEKW
[2:35:46] Seaarcher: he gonna despawn before u get there no ?
[2:35:47] ociriss: maybe holy water from teh fountain
[2:35:48] SpaceCowboy0811: I dont think the devs would set it up so he needs to be kited across the map...
[2:35:48] SuperLost89: i seriously cant see blizzard making a boss and then making people drag it to a small island to kill it
[2:35:49] rawlexdota: Maybe turn in bloods at the bijou altar, something else happens
[2:35:51] caypr: @guzu have you had a priest mind control mobs in stv to see if any have debuffs
[2:35:52] LuminescentLlama: @Exophalic gucku Kap

[2:36:09] Plaguethong: You have to kite him to the bengal tiger STV cave KEKW.
[2:36:11] twitchforgotmyaccount: Servers will give in long before his HP bar does
[2:36:12] paddingwow: @Guzu Bring him to the monkey island
[2:36:12] trueroleta: hey guzu if you made it to 5% with just one raid group why do you not try with 2 raid groups
[2:36:13] packtar: so you think that Blizzard wants to to kite a boss across a whole zone over water to an Island? Tin Foil
[2:36:13] Foodlebar: @NirvanaFlamez FirstTimeYapper
[2:36:18] Knaxxis: bunch of EU cringer mages ruined it huh

[2:36:28] LuminescentLlama: yapping vp
[2:36:28] nodnarB_: have him fight king kong KEKW
[2:36:29] Ranzorx: you guys are trying to big brain this when blizzard didn't bother planning something for this

[2:36:40] Frostlicious: KEK
[2:36:42] Melkor_Active: @Guzu He gets HP according to the ears he earn at 20%. So the trick is for sure not to die that much.
[2:36:42] mordiell: i thought m,aybe those big mobs would be hostile to him but its a long shot

[2:37:04] MightyCactus1: how low did he get?
[2:37:04] rivetssore: i dont think blizz would go for a mechanic that requires you to pull a huge boss thru a whole area
[2:37:06] Nunadaaa: and its impossible to not die
[2:37:07] Nunadaaa: LULW
[2:37:08] Yahyawow: I doubt that aswell
[2:37:08] oeoe_lord: you need to bring him to bengal cave and he spawns a tiger that drops the mount
[2:37:08] Airdin93: 4HEad
[2:37:08] mordiell: i really hope its not that
[2:37:09] esbi__: Loa is collecting blood for Hakkar so it maybe has something to do with ZG or ZG isladn @Guzu
[2:37:09] Shhlurpo: Mages spamming arcance explosion LUL
[2:37:10] Sockentee: but the hp increase was the same as on NA
[2:37:11] Wissew: just dont die 4Head
[2:37:12] Yvernaa: How do you avoid not dying that much tho
[2:37:13] omwtwopluto: U can't not die rofl
[2:37:13] apx_Teixeira: 1831 kills om
[2:37:13] Constera: Rogues can pickpocket a trinket from trolls, so far it has only been used for priest Dispersion rune, maybe it has some other use Hmm
[2:37:13] Sillychops: spam target dummies so he doesnt kill players
[2:37:14] Trexbo_: Mainly gnome mages, human paladins, and undead rogues got me. In conclusion Alliance players are mainly the problem YEP
[2:37:14] piperboi: you cant even repair?
[2:37:15] Yahyawow: If thats the case its legit impossible

[2:37:17] Yahyawow: he cleaves and 1 shots
[2:37:18] LithinTV: Maybe you could use "Elixir of Coalesced Regret" to do something
[2:37:18] azshare_: F in the chat who guzu sacrificed
[2:37:19] bhrowster: have a warlock tank just get aggro and run until 20%
[2:37:19] mordiell: i want it to be something special to discover
[2:37:20] Elijahss: He gained the exact same amount on NA
[2:37:20] Joshy_osh: You need to Opt out to avoid PvPers. You can still attack him right?
[2:37:21] limburgse: boss oneshots peeps, how you dont let that happen?
[2:37:22] jerry_53_: @guzu repair gear

[2:37:24] smithers0351: waa mailbox
[2:37:26] Awsmsauce: check if he got the same amount of hp today compared to xaryu's try
[2:37:30] frederikv225: so arena and the one who have aggo jump down and die, all stay up top
[2:37:31] eraxs: Are ya gonna attempt this in 3 hours?
[2:37:32] ScootSmith: idk if thats it, the other groups could of had to have died the same exact amount for the HP to increase to the same thing
[2:37:32] sementa4k: Ppc
[2:37:33] Yahyawow: theres no way you're able to limit the amount of deaths
[2:37:33] burnitdown_leon: if it isnt killable blizz would just make him immune @guzu
[2:37:33] piperboi: bennies :O

[2:37:34] Jonn_nner: xdd666 banned
[2:37:36] mordiell: @eraxs yes
[2:37:41] oeoe_lord: you need to bring him to bengal cave and he spawns a tiger that drops the mount
[2:37:44] yoslo1: you get profession helm yet? plate one is sick

[2:37:59] Dovahkcin: @Guzu is there a remove frenzy or enrage spell a class has at this level? he goes frenzy 󠀀
[2:37:59] eraxs: I'll rally some people for the evening then
[2:38:00] AbyssReborn: did it die?
[2:38:00] saren_x: CONSPIRACY
[2:38:02] niveous_a: @chub_222 he's eu mate

[2:38:23] stankylank: hell yeah, enjoy guz
[2:38:23] ScootSmith: get him on to a zepplin then make him jump off, maybe he takes fall dmg
[2:38:23] Estairria_: wtf why >:(
[2:38:23] ellgthompson: he would just charge at the casters anyway if there was no melee don’t think it’s a range thing
[2:38:23] booddhi: dont disrespect the tinfoil hat
[2:38:23] packtar: It would be informative to look at the number of deaths and the health of the boss at 20% compare different attempts to see if their is a correlation.
[2:38:24] Boneyards_666: o7
[2:38:24] wtfblub: retiring Sadge

[2:38:40] Tiamattinen: Where in Norway are you going? Mostly southern parts?
[2:38:41] veryhard17: @guzu  the monk throws sacred poop at the Boss and he does not heal anymore bc of infection
[2:38:41] Haq_RS: CONSPIRACY pepe silvia pepe silvia, i got boxes full of pepe

[2:38:50] SuperLost89: @Guzu my theory is there's a quote the boss says, and thats an indicator on when to turn in blood at the altar to damage him
[2:38:55] Boneyards_666: adventures with mordiell pogg
[2:38:56] Plaguethong: EXACTLY

[2:39:17] catbalou2: You dont even know if his health poll boosts again at 10%
[2:39:18] LabyrinthMW: peepoHey hello Guzu hello chat im home from work
[2:39:19] Djbeerguy723: on Wowhead it says he is unkillable.
[2:39:19] mytownnn: guzu
[2:39:24] yoslo1: @guzu you took a 6 day break last year as well.
[2:39:24] chimchar183: why would the gms be nerfing him and be there if ur not supposed to kill him?
[2:39:25] jerry_53_: at this point they HAVE TO implement something if there is nothing to it @Guzu
[2:39:25] BWAttila: Did u hear about the wow classic streamer who went away for a week and never returned?
[2:39:26] postnoxx: "whole" except the 50 mages blowing everyone up Kappa
[2:39:27] hagspretten: SKÅL
[2:39:27] NoiseCow: Agree, that was fun. Tnx for trying it out in EU as well.
[2:39:28] burnitdown_leon: yeah but then blizz would make him immune no? @guzu
[2:39:28] frederikv225: did you see what the gm write to xary then they try it

[2:39:39] Plaguethong: Blizzard wouldnt have this kind of secrecy in the game
[2:39:40] JNOFI: vacation to norway?? havent we had winter long enough>???

[2:39:48] nicktamere666: thats what he said
[2:39:49] Boneyards_666: if he was unkillable he wouldnt take any damage from the start
[2:39:51] eaksyn: I don't think the ear theory is true, it looked like xaryu's boss had the same hp increase even though there he had a lot more ears
[2:39:52] SgtDirtbag: players will always find a way
[2:39:55] SpaceCowboy0811: read the tablet at the alter there @Guzu
[2:39:56] SlapdickWoWplayer: A GM brought a character in and helped kill for a second. It's on twitter

[2:40:01] mytownnn: enough poplw@die will please the blood@god
[2:40:03] Kinghorn: cobaltBug cobaltPop LabyrinthMW
[2:40:03] Mygdrayl: @Guzu blizzzard now better that people would try to kill him, prob is not possible now, or they want the player to figure it out
[2:40:04] booddhi: he said "the blood loa thanks you for your offerings"
[2:40:04] voncline88: This bloodmoon boss is the spirit of Classic.  They have actually recreated the Vanilla feel with it
[2:40:08] rullehjem: @Guzu maybe it has something to do with the Mind Goblin?
[2:40:09] snygglejf: They didn't type anything, but like all of them got an update after the try where GM appered
[2:40:11] Deonardocilaprio: seggs altar
[2:40:14] mytownnn: people@have to die to kill the boss
[2:40:15] ellgthompson: go just tanked he didn’t help kill at all
[2:40:15] ShingaTV: peak wow time <3

[2:40:23] frederikv225: it was "blood for the blood loa" he write
[2:40:24] Sillychops: maybe the island music will make him /dance, it's a jam
[2:40:24] kocham_gry: this is going to be zul gurub island
[2:40:27] Gwalch: bijou thiss
[2:40:29] Kinghorn: kirby just wants the bugs power
[2:40:29] smithers0351: @theatomicalchemist bootyy yo
[2:40:31] Nieboldt: Does someone know anything about the chest at Janeiro Peak ? Was is there in vanilla too with that thunderstorm every 20 sek?
[2:40:33] Frostlicious: i dont know why blood makes heal mechanic not work though. Seems intended
[2:40:33] Slafze: Only the gorilla can kill him
[2:40:40] StreamElements: Go check out my Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/guzutv
[2:40:40] TMMOOF: Loa vs Loa deathmatch for last 20%?
[2:40:41] niveous_a: ratJAM troll music
[2:40:43] ashtaroxx: plunk
[2:40:43] burnitdown_leon: maybe the priests will leech blood  from him
[2:40:44] Boneyards_666: pogg
[2:40:45] NilzVentura: i think its not somethin that already exists...
[2:40:45] Synthez542: @Guzu Posted this while you guys were killing, but what if you take him to Aggrends Twitter background picture - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/106860685878628352/1212766608502816788/image.png?ex=65f307eb&is=65e092eb&hm=17ce3f772caff0d98efe8fc878f5f23481212e54e9a87108935cca0976e0fd40&
[2:40:45] SuperLost89: this is talking about hakkar
[2:40:46] smithers0351: ratJAM
[2:40:46] legengerry_: I have a friend working for Blizz that said a couple of secrets haven't been discovered yet for P1, so P2 must be the same thing as well.
[2:40:48] ashtaroxx: plunk oh shiiiiiii
[2:40:49] Plaguethong: @Guzu THis is not copium. SOme1 mentioned yesterday that there is a tablet somewhere that mentions something
[2:40:51] hajliett: Has ssf hc been released
[2:40:51] Deonardocilaprio: maayyybe
[2:40:53] jerry_53_: i would just try it @Guzu
[2:40:54] ben_mdlol: @guzu has anyone killed him yet
[2:41:00] smithers0351: CONSPIRACY
[2:41:00] Boneyards_666: but the other guy is buffed by the power of the blood god
[2:41:01] Cybervert: bydeLOA you be needin da help of de loa
[2:41:03] mordiell: this might be long shot
[2:41:04] safkae: hmjj
[2:41:08] LeeshDK: somewhere something guzuNotes
[2:41:10] Djbeerguy723: Blizzard probably put something he stays alive at 1%
[2:41:11] HelluvaWrecks: @legengerry_ the devs themselves said everything in p1 was discovered
[2:41:12] Estairria_: tablet somewhere that mentions something Thinkge
[2:41:12] NilzVentura: or a hint
[2:41:13] hagspretten: "somewhere" "something" xdd
[2:41:13] mordiell: but can you bow before it or pray? guzu
[2:41:14] mytownnn: the loot this god drops unreeeeeal
[2:41:15] booddhi: It was Sivix that mentioned it @Guzu
[2:41:15] Fai_z: or before
[2:41:16] Foodlebar: om that lock name
[2:41:17] Trodenskjold: @Plaguethong There is a lot of tablets somewhere, that mentions something
[2:41:19] Deonardocilaprio: or pull him somewhere
[2:41:19] mordiell: maybe theres a buff
[2:41:20] Ari0n0s: nowayy hakkar the blood god , maybe it has to do with sunken temple
[2:41:21] Saul_97: How did boss go?
[2:41:22] Arcinatos: wanna bet that blizzard introduces an item in the next couple of days LULE
[2:41:23] Eran_: this altar is worth a shot
[2:41:26] Yvernaa: Prayge
[2:41:28] hersftw: @Guzu the lore of the boss is somewhat related to that island, at least someone said so in Xar's stream yday
[2:41:30] Chockerande: %?
[2:41:31] Modebc: Savix already killed him in a 1v1 btw
[2:41:31] smithers0351: crunch vp if you are supposed to kill him
[2:41:32] esbi__: Discovery stream today...search all of STV for clue Guzu
[2:41:33] legengerry_: @HelluvaWrecks Then my friend is a hard lier lol
[2:41:34] eaksyn: you could brute-force it if it weren't laggy
[2:41:36] canidius: Basepool HP is 3,1m. From 20%, 633k, he went to ±14m. So thats 4,5x max hp. He had ±2000 ears, who would equite to him gaining 7k health per kill, or 0,2% of his max initial HP
[2:41:37] voncline88: At this point I think you are definitely supposed to kill the boss.  Why else would the devs be hinting towards it
[2:41:39] mordiell: maybe during event
[2:41:40] Acework: maybe its later stuff when we get stuff secret item from actual ZG @Guzu
[2:41:40] elendo: there is no way you have to bring him somewhere, with his different spawns
[2:41:42] EyeFromWyoming: bring him to king kong 100%
[2:41:44] Synthez542: @Guzu Posted this while you guys were killing, but what if you take him to Aggrends Twitter background picture - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/106860685878628352/1212766608502816788/image.png?ex=65f307eb&is=65e092eb&hm=17ce3f772caff0d98efe8fc878f5f23481212e54e9a87108935cca0976e0fd40& 󠀀
[2:41:46] Deonardocilaprio: maybe get blood and then klick on altar
[2:41:47] Plaguethong: @Guzu Xaryu talked about it yesterday too, that there is a tablet that talks about him
[2:41:48] elendo: would be such a dumb mechanic
[2:41:50] Kinghorn: guldan shower, sounds like a dan or NL viewer
[2:41:57] catbalou2: The health boost at 20% proves he was meant to be unkillable...there will probably be another at a lower%
[2:41:57] StreamElements: Kazay1998 just tipped $3.00 PogChamp
[2:42:00] ashtaroxx: plunk i've heard Nomsinn already killed this boss
[2:42:03] burnitdown_leon: better try then nothing
[2:42:04] meeeekii: take him to duskwood to fight stitches
[2:42:04] paddingwow: @Synthez542 TRUE
[2:42:06] Tropicocity: @mordiell peepoHey
[2:42:09] TKoNoR: Did they kill that shitstain ?
[2:42:11] mordiell: getting some sort of buff or item would be more likely, maybe LUL
[2:42:11] crainiam: @Synthez542 That's where they were attacking him
[2:42:13] Epiqschwer: maybe you need 255 blood also to attack him cause he stacks at 255 ears
[2:42:18] paco__gutierrez: !tts
[2:42:18] StreamElements: TTS is used for subs, donos 3$ and higher and cheers 300 and higher. Use voices and sound bits: https://tts.monster/guzu
[2:42:18] paddingwow: Guzu Read Synthez
[2:42:19] mordiell: Tropicocity peepoHey
[2:42:21] LuminescentLlama: i kill boss yesterday
[2:42:22] 1cyveins: worst emote ever award goes to... plunk
[2:42:23] yoslo1: you should have used all world buffs?
[2:42:23] Trexbo_: Maybe Xaryu confused him for the blood god mentioned in what you just read NODDERS
[2:42:29] Tropicocity: peepoHappy
[2:42:29] Frostlicious: GMs prob dont think its possible is why they went
[2:42:33] Melkor_Active: It was only 1 GM
[2:42:34] Joxtirol: what does bruise debuff do
[2:42:38] smithers0351: plunk vp
[2:42:39] kinkylolftw1: @guzu What about smacking him with the white items from SM? those new items must have some use right?
[2:42:42] mangocat40: having to drag it somwhere just sounds stupid
[2:42:42] esbi__: Yeah
[2:42:45] voltrox1909: CALL UPON THE DEFIAS BROTHERHOOD.
[2:42:45] Yahyawow: Yeah that was his spawn

[2:42:50] ellgthompson: it stops at 255 ears but it goes into the thousands if you mouse over it
[2:42:51] Sillychops: what if he has to visit every alter
[2:42:55] ShingaTV: @Frostlicious thats why they even scaled his heal down right? clueless^^
[2:42:55] AzureClaw: no those are the ruins above grom'gol
[2:42:57] donoghlen: !actually
[2:42:59] paddingwow: @Guzu isnt that Northwest?
[2:43:00] Blackminuz: what classes you got at lvl 40? :) @Guzu
[2:43:00] brutusbrbr: you people are starting to go crazy with cospiracy theory.  Its not the time to kill yet, blizzard probly are getting keeping it
[2:43:02] donoghlen: $cookie
[2:43:02] Supibot: donoghlen, Your daily cookie: Expect to exchange a lot of phone calls and emails with friends today. Communication with others is your top priority.
[2:43:04] zakkoncrak: I think it just means he only cares about you turning in blood
[2:43:05] pooman7913: I think take him to the altars at 20 and then everyone sacrifices their bloods while he’s there
[2:43:06] IllIllIIllIIlllIlIlIllIll: how shit the event is omg
[2:43:06] 1cyveins: BBoomer
[2:43:06] Asmii: they're priest rune
[2:43:08] onewish_wow: its a healing reducing debuff stacking?????
[2:43:08] nms92: Wasnt there supposed to be a boss that spawns at the end of the event and whoever kills it would get a WB for their faction? Was this idea scrapped?
[2:43:10] HelluvaWrecks: the sm items are for priest rune
[2:43:11] AnanasEnjoyer: OneGuy
[2:43:12] LabyrinthMW: $cookie
[2:43:12] Kazay1998: @Melkor_Active there were 2. He wrote in chat and you could see the blizzard logo by his name
[2:43:12] Supibot: labyrinthmw, Your daily cookie: Patience is a key to joy.
[2:43:12] Djbeerguy723: drag him to stormwind
[2:43:13] Kinghorn: they are for the pain supression rune
[2:43:14] Synthez542: @Guzu That's northwest trolls. Kinda where you are now
[2:43:15] hersftw: those items are for a priest rune
[2:43:20] booddhi: no

[2:43:23] Honax_Official: But not all classes get weapons?
[2:43:23] LabyrinthMW: @Supibot maybe thats why im depressed i dont have patience
[2:43:24] DaTh_Champ: many people dont have weapons from event - not possible
[2:43:24] bearfukuu: Well that is stupid, alot of people dont use those weapons
[2:43:25] MlLKYBLAST: @Guzu You could try dragging him here? Worth a shot at least? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhE3R2xXWAg
[2:43:26] crainiam: Most people are using them though
[2:43:26] adrianplzstop: how troll would it be if the boss has to be killed in gurubashi arena but he doesnt drop it , the chest that spawns would have 1 tiger
[2:43:26] Lugosiqt: nah bro
[2:43:27] Plaguethong: But do the mages just have to use the rings? Because we cant purchase any blood weapons
[2:43:28] Elijahss: only melee get weapons though
[2:43:29] caypr: but not every class has weapons
[2:43:32] TMMOOF: maybe blood weapons remove his ear stacks?
[2:43:33] Kinghorn: kinkylolftw1 they are hints for the priest pain supression rune
[2:43:33] EyeFromWyoming: everybody uses those
[2:43:33] NilzVentura: the sm items are used for runes, dont they
[2:43:35] voncline88: I think you just need to pump the 20% extra HP.  It's just a hard fight
[2:43:36] hollywoodxJ: Probably have to find a way to get rid of bruised stacks to kill him
[2:43:36] bearfukuu: Ranged dont get weapons

[2:43:46] bigsharkieboi: Theres 0% chance blizzard made a mob that needed 500 people to kill with special mechanics, he's probably either meant to be killed in p3 or not at all
[2:43:48] Synthez542: @Guzu That picture is where you're heading now
[2:43:50] ScovieJ: and Blizz wouldnt gatekeep players who havent bought the weapons yet not to be able to he;lp
[2:43:51] elendo: or you have to turn in a certain amount of blood at 20% or something
[2:43:52] derpaherbertt: You need to bring him to the deadmines watergate, when there Van'Cleef will pop out and  hand out astral tiger mounts to everyone. He will then mount the weakened bloodgod and ride him atop mount Doom, destroying the ring and beginning a 30 day fiesta for all of Skyrim.
[2:43:52] creativename102: @Guzu Can you have a grp of hunters/healers drag Theramus from blasted lands to stv and have them fight? He could do some good damage to him/is close enough to drag to stv

[2:44:13] Honax_Official: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=438286/dnt-khadamu-zone-tracking-aura Uhhh, could this mean you gotta move him somewhere?
[2:44:20] mimic124: @creativename102 you cant drag mobs outside of zones
[2:44:20] ben_mdlol: You're not supposed to kill him hence why GMS interacted with him, they are stalling it till they figure out a loot table @Guzu
[2:44:21] snygglejf: You should press all the altars at the same time, BOOOM!
[2:44:22] Frostlicious: @ShingaTV 14m/67m is not a scale down LMAO. The only mechanic thats interesting pertaining to him is the heal mechanic being stopped by blood
[2:44:23] fabdaddyx: NA did have nonstop d/cs yesterday and they were pretty close to killing still @guzu it probably just dies
[2:44:23] Syzlak3: only fewe class got those weapons so prob not
[2:44:25] paco__gutierrez: Cheer300 (alert). megan: Guzu, it seems like maybe you can't kill the boss because of a massive skill issue. (silence) (silence)(gunshot)(yoda) LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

[2:44:30] Melkor_Active: He will not get that much HP if he doesnt earn that much Ears
[2:44:35] Dasvovobrot: I feel like it would be some crazy secret quest chain to get an item that you can use on him to weaken him and if enough people use it he's killable or smth
[2:44:39] Shreddingly: have you read the description of the new alchemy rejuvenation potions? maybe he gets poisoned if he kills someone with that effect once he goes into that increased health phase? Kind a like hakkar poisoned blood mechanic?

[2:44:48] eyonixz: i think hes just not suppose to be killable and you're all WAY overthinking this
[2:44:49] Hylaren: GuzuJackOing xqcShareW
[2:44:50] shykuar: that is his spawn track
[2:44:51] Lionkingler1: when he leaves the zone he despawns?
[2:44:53] twitchforgotmyaccount: Probably makes him teleport to STV is he's kited out
[2:44:54] mimic124: Wokege
[2:44:55] tuske2001: it probably has to do with the amount of people he kills before he hits 20%, the ears gotta mean something
[2:44:55] Nunadaaa: LUL
[2:44:56] somedanskperson: When he's at 20% maybe place 1 person at each tablet and the activate it?
[2:44:57] donoghlen: oof
[2:44:57] SgtDirtbag: guess thats just for when ppl will pull him out of stv
[2:44:57] shakathedon: thats probably the kite protection so he cant be brought to cities
[2:44:57] caypr: om
[2:44:57] danbalanceltrist: YEP
[2:44:57] CarsInTheSky: maybe that's to detect if he's dragged out stv and deletes him

[2:45:08] adrianplzstop: kill in guru arena and the arena AGM trinket chest would have 1 tiger in it
[2:45:11] Kinghorn: L
[2:45:15] Fai_z: I imaging he'll get more health when he gets to 4% (1/5 of 20%) again if you don't do some mechanic correctly.
[2:45:16] somedanskperson: When he's at 20% maybe place 1 person at each tablet and the activate it???
[2:45:20] ninjaskurk: Maybe that is next phase
[2:45:20] Deonardocilaprio: sadge
[2:45:23] Kermeous: I think the irridated 3 piece sets, causing him to take dmg instead of heal from his aoe would be a good interaction
[2:45:23] danbalanceltrist: heheChatting
[2:45:24] skrutscher: That Zone tracking aura is just the aura you get when you are 200 and 100 yard range of him, you get the blood, maim, kill w/e buff and the other one, thats whats that for i believe
[2:45:25] oXSalemXo: this guy is just the mini boss om
[2:45:28] ShingaTV: @Frostlicious 14/67m is not even a heal mechanic and the blood is not even confirmed
[2:45:31] Tropicocity: They removed that idea, they didnt want too many world buffs to feel 'mandatory' in SoD
[2:45:31] thisautumn: I RECALL HEARING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
[2:45:34] Trexbo_: D: WHY ARE YOU YELLING!?
[2:45:38] LuminescentLlama: uber rare item drop from gnomer
[2:45:39] ben_mdlol: @mordiell idk i dont see why the gms would interact with it if it was supposed to die
[2:45:40] benutzer300: u guys killed him?

[2:45:47] Asmii: I had a new 2 stack debuff of an arm that said the blood loa needs support but I didnt get to read more before I died
[2:45:51] somedanskperson: When he's at 20% maybe place 1 person at each tablet and the activate it?
[2:45:53] john_kskdko: shaman leveling?
[2:45:54] l1naj_: @Guzu there should be some way to properly kill him, because servers without very big streamers wont be able to kill it otherwise
[2:45:54] hearingblockchain: When will they be attempting to kill again/
[2:45:59] Trodenskjold: Quick question. Did you try to, idk, just kill him
[2:45:59] hollywoodxJ: EXPLORE STV and try and find a place to DROP BRUISED BUFF
[2:46:02] Frostlicious: @ShingaTV delusional
[2:46:06] esbi__: You couldn't kill him cuz mordiell wasn't there. You guys lack dmg
[2:46:07] Synthez542: Did you hear Savix say yesterday with Xar once the boss health went to like 19 Mil "This is just the burn phase" KEKW
[2:46:09] FreeScout324: Gold Coin trust me bro
[2:46:09] Nunadaaa: LULW
[2:46:13] vepsee: hes made to be killed at 60 so the event is always used
[2:46:14] saren_x: maybe you need to try WITH ALL THE RUNES Hmm
[2:46:15] Boneyards_666: power of the kok
[2:46:15] Shreddingly: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=435971/mildly-irradiated-rejuvenation-potion Remember this funny looking description? Maybe he gets poisoned when he kills someone with this effect?
[2:46:15] convexdnb: why do you think its not just everyone with blood attacking?
[2:46:23] LuminescentLlama: glol gucku
[2:46:24] DaTh_Champ: drag him to the boat and take him off stv where he gets his power
[2:46:29] Djbeerguy723: I hear he drops 50 copper
[2:46:29] adrianplzstop: @Guzu  have him die in the guru arena on the chest and the chest gives 1 tiger , the entire server would be killing each other
[2:46:30] Dasvovobrot: everyone should have kept their greenches
[2:46:31] Huertix: ChipiChapa dubi dubi daba daba

[2:47:03] mimic124: a cute peepoCute
[2:47:07] Spl1ker: its also perfect lvl
[2:47:11] jimzan1: @Guzu It would make sence to drag him somewhere because he get the hp buff at low%, like you have to get him down to that % meanwhile you drag him to the spot.
[2:47:12] Jaicco: Hakkar mechanics
[2:47:14] hollywoodxJ: EXPLORE STV and try and find a place to DROP BRUISED BUFF
[2:47:15] bojack359: Are there multiple alts? If so maybe you have to take him to each one
[2:47:15] HeadShot794: OM ok that's too much
[2:47:17] Dasvovobrot: it would be what hakkar does
[2:47:18] kocham_gry: damn, this is actually good idea
[2:47:19] Sapph1: There are some hiden chest around the world that noone managed to open< maybe they keep smth to kill that boss
[2:47:20] rollinsthechamp: @Guzu Pls look at this if you haven´t already https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/news/dungeons-dragons-datamining-sunken-temple-could-be-the-next-raid-in-season-of-discovery/
[2:47:24] Hylaren: Listening
[2:47:25] gazargh: gnomer 3p set gives you "irradiated blood" green aura thingy.
[2:47:25] HelluvaWrecks: I think he gains health at 20% for each ears he has
[2:47:27] voncline88: definitely should test the potion
[2:47:27] Melkor_Active: ONLY FOR ALCHEMIST USEABLE
[2:47:27] justaround31: at t his point if everything is a long shot then nothing is and  that means it could work
[2:47:29] Imperator1v9: Tinfoil conspiracies getting too much
[2:47:35] catbalou2: Ita a Blizzard trick to try and keep people engaged while theres nothing left to do;]
[2:47:35] jobetss: puttin more thought into this than blizzard LUL
[2:47:36] chr47: People are looking into this way to much, he just wasn't meant to be killed
[2:47:38] vaknah: @guzu do you know off hand what weak aura you're using for totems on the shaman? I love how yours look compared to mine but can't find them.
[2:47:39] Kermeous: Hi AOE heal ability, get 3 piece gnomer and it causes to take dmg? https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=437715/blood-leech
[2:47:42] Znuffle: Maybe he is into femboys and you have to wear the best transmog to distract him or something.. 100%
[2:47:42] caypr: have you tried throwing the new engi bombs at him?
[2:47:45] Yahyawow: If there is a way to kill him I doubt it would be something like this
[2:47:45] 1cyveins: relvl alch
[2:47:45] Dovahkcin: @Guzu Just call Blizzard and ask. You are a billionare im sure they will answer you
[2:47:47] JNOFI: What about entering ZG seeing if there is anything new in there?
[2:47:47] MlLKYBLAST: Could you try dragging him here? Thoughts @Guzu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhE3R2xXWAg
[2:47:52] Oopogo1: IRR-RAY-DEE-AY-TED
[2:47:53] Tropicocity: "We noticed something interesting in the most recent Classic Era datamining: the Temple of Atal’Hakkar dungeon, also known as the Sunken Temple, now has a 3-day lockout. It also has a lock ID consistent with being the next raid in the game: Blackfathom Deeps has a lock ID of 21, Gnomeregan is 22, and Sunken Temple is 23. This is a strong clue that the instance is being made into the level-up raid for Phase 3 when we reach level 50."
[2:47:59] mordiell: you have to do this stripp irl three times when the event starts so you get the buff to kill him
[2:47:59] Somra: SERVER SHUTDOWN? Smadging
[2:48:00] RAM__: how do you send sound effects and TTS here? :)
[2:48:01] sircrumpler: Are there any items in wow that give a poison de buff when consumed?
[2:48:02] donoghlen: @Foodlebar catKISS
[2:48:02] shykuar: yeah this is the fun part
[2:48:02] eaksyn: that description is just hinting, that you get 30% ms debuff and 100% damage increase vs nature etc
[2:48:06] Yahyawow: They'd make it something difficult to find but not impossible
[2:48:07] khertajo: @Znuffle what's a femboy?

[4:35:51] Supibot: ohelloo, 🤖 As an AI, I do not have specific information on individual players, so I cannot determine whether Guzu is good at World of Warcraft (WoW). Player skill in WoW can vary greatly depending on various factors such as experience, knowledge of the game mechanics, strategy, practice, and dedication. If you provide me with more context, I may be able to offer some general tips or advice related to WoW.

[4:37:46] Supibot: ohelloo, 🤖 I'm not sure specifically about a streamer named Guzu, but "variety streamer" typically refers to someone who streams a variety of different games or content on platforms like Twitch or YouTube. These streamers switch between different games or activities rather than focusing on just one. If Guzu streams a range of content, then they could be considered a variety streamer.
