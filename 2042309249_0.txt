[0:17:10] nocturnal__nightingale: Hi Hazel, I hope you are having a great day! I decided to start a brand new shadow priest adventure of my own, after maining a prot pally for years. Any advice?
[0:17:10] middleagerookie: I get cloaks from Amirdrassil weeklies so often.. like 5 cloaks to 1 of anything else..
[0:17:28] lucie2017: NC here too. I'm hoping to make a lemon cake today.
[0:17:38] Yigolo2: Save it!
[0:17:53] UltraDankNooner: def save
[0:17:57] superab02: Question! Do you consider yourself a nerd?
[0:18:18] cashthb: well you could do a daily and just get one crafted
[0:18:19] UltraDankNooner: ive tried to rely on vault hope before, never ends well
[0:18:24] cashthb: if the thingy drops that is
[0:18:34] cashthb: *weekly
[0:18:36] Zuldak: nerd culture is super trendy now adays
[0:19:01] Delidragon: I am making elderberry syrup
[0:19:03] jeffdmk: @nocturnal__nightingale I am sorry
[0:19:09] Daemavand: Having just come back from MAGFest, I completely agree, Zul
[0:19:15] tofuwizard: Nerd culture is the new troll
[0:19:45] cashthb: i think they can just drop from weekly chets, not sure tho
[0:19:53] nocturnal__nightingale: @jeffdmk hahahaha, I've been getting that a lot :)
[0:19:55] sence_00: morning Hazel! Hope your day goes well - Im on a role with pets today, scored Sandkeep and a Revendreth rare spidey
[0:20:00] UltraDankNooner: not just any dig
[0:20:02] UltraDankNooner: the big dig
[0:20:18] UltraDankNooner: i got the mount from my 2nd dig
[0:20:22] Kurama__95: @nocturnal__nightingale Spriest is super fun and just got buffed this week, so you'll def have a good time
[0:20:40] prince_adam76: Hello Hazel,  you amazing person. I was stuck in 10 minute follower only mode.
[0:20:43] Darabelia: is there a quest to get started on the digs.
[0:20:46] Zuldak: the Ochre dreamtalon is easy to get, just time gated
[0:21:00] Darabelia: oh ok thhanks
[0:21:14] blessed_novella: how do you get the dinosaur mount with the AH?
[0:21:34] GreenArrowed: @blessed_novella black market ah now
[0:21:38] nocturnal__nightingale: @Kurama__95 Thanks! So far it's been slow and squishy, but I've been learning and having fun. I love the fantasy about it though.
[0:22:22] anker_jym: Hazel, since you have so many mounts, do you know if there's an achievement after the Otherworldly Ottuk one? That's the next one I need, and I didn't know if they kept going.
[0:22:50] Zuldak: correct thats the latest
[0:23:05] fallingupwards: Wonder what they'll add as next mount meta
[0:23:06] Kurama__95: It's usually 1 new meta per expansion and the ottuk was for DF
[0:23:06] InakaUk: Ottuk is last atm
[0:23:13] anker_jym: Cool, thanks! Only 1 more to go then lol
[0:23:38] Tr4umhaft: what addon makes the interaction look different with seeds?
[0:24:08] CPT_Lemons: Good morning
[0:25:28] Daemavand: Plus, lemon is great for future baked goods :D
[0:25:47] Sansuyu: Morning
[0:25:57] fallingupwards: I found a recipe for almond cookies I plan on making this weekend, can't wait lol
[0:26:06] GreenArrowed: whenever i need buttermilk for something i always make something else needs buttermilk so i can use it all at one time
[0:26:10] Tr4umhaft: installed, tested it just know and love it - thank you very much
[0:26:19] Elrathir: I dig it
[0:26:21] GreenArrowed: luckily we have pints at my store so it's never too much
[0:26:27] CPT_Lemons: What mount that you have collected are you the most proud of?
[0:26:33] blessed_novella: if you shake heavy whipping cream, you can get fresh butter and buttermilk at the same time 💕
[0:27:05] Zuldak: yep, now you have a mount to remind you of the pain every time you get on it
[0:27:10] XxGarthakxX: Morning! How you seen the new Guild Wars 2 UI addon? Its really cool, def diggin it
[0:27:21] amaya21: hey Hazel! i just entered Enshrouded, seems fun, will you play it ?
[0:27:23] treebirdtv: void talon took me ALONG time to camp. took me nearly 24 hours of straight camping
[0:27:39] msmester1: Hello FeelsGoodMan
[0:27:40] amaya21: nice!!
[0:27:49] Daemavand: Too many games!
[0:27:55] sence_00: have we figured out if there are rep benefits from the Archivists?
[0:27:55] GreenArrowed: palworld has been fun to watch
[0:28:03] GreenArrowed: i dare not start playing myself
[0:28:08] amaya21: yeah enshrouded is co op like that, needs dedicated server
[0:28:27] msmester1: what is my server even we are 3guys at the excavation site lol
[0:28:27] Daemavand: I picked up"Chicken Journey" today for my Switch on a friend recommendation and it's everything I need right now in my life
[0:28:54] prince_adam76: Sorry stepped away to get coffee , what did I miss. Can we rewind stream
[0:28:55] anker_jym: When I saw you were streaming Palworld, I thought I had entered an alternate universe lol. Do you enjoy it?
[0:28:57] seadub: i saw it once and I hated it lol. never going back
[0:29:30] sence_00: ya I got enough fragments for a couple items and idk if I even want all of it
[0:29:49] prince_adam76: Hitting the Hazel rewind . Lol

[0:30:22] Streamlabs: nocturnal__nightingale just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:31:34] Daemavand: Simple cute wholesome platformer, you're a chicken and you complete quests to help your friends in your Chicken village. Pixel art, but it's a platformer so I'm not sure if it'll be your thing
[0:31:43] Daemavand: That said, it's a very easy platformer
[0:31:47] electttro: Hi Hazel!
[0:32:39] Daemavand: As I bought it to play in place of Rayman Legends because its platforming levels got too demanding for my tired brain lol
[0:32:44] fallingupwards: It takes a while to get fragments lol I bought the mount so far
[0:32:48] prince_adam76: Guess no rewind with Hazel. Lol
[0:33:04] Rev3rendBilly: It's also that Azerothian Archives are ... pretty ass tbh.
[0:33:11] jakefx1: yeah look at this, it slows down after one week...
[0:33:31] Daemavand: Yeah afaik playback/remind is only available for the VOF

[0:34:40] McScooterson: but you gotta run around and beat mobs with Lumierre
[0:34:58] Daemavand: The candlestick will allow her to light the way for your friends when you tank!
[0:35:03] prince_adam76: I have been doing my alt leveling for the last month. I have 2 warriors, 1 hunter, 1 druid and 1 monk to 70 now working on dk and pally
[0:35:06] witchhobbit: i love my candle stick on my pally. need more plate mog tho

[0:35:20] Daemavand: Lol
[0:35:28] jakefx1: hazelTen hazelTen hazelTen
[0:35:56] prince_adam76: I like the tank classes
[0:36:36] Zuldak: you remember him because you had to use the thingy on the big orbs for a pet
[0:36:39] Kurama__95: "Ah, my apprentice, you return at last" is still seared into my brain savixKEKW
[0:36:41] Zuldak: the strands
[0:36:47] yeppining: i feel a little insane i have 31 characters at level 70....
[0:36:51] jgbrit: You mean you don't remember Ven'ari? How could you!
[0:36:56] fallingupwards: Theyre marked on your map:)
[0:37:03] 6thbiscuit: Use the yellow dots on your mini-map
[0:37:09] MrSonicgen: Hello there.
[0:37:25] witchhobbit: i have been meaning to look at how to get the pets from this event. i feel like one of them is from the world quests??
[0:37:36] Kurama__95: @yeppining If it makes you feel better I have 47 level 70s and i'm not particularly proud lol
[0:37:37] GreenArrowed: i never maxxed out venari
[0:37:47] 1nightplays: hazel where the nutty come from lol
[0:37:56] G0chiefs: thanks for having drops on
[0:37:59] Daemavand: Why spend more time in the Maw than necessary lol
[0:38:08] jakefx1: she didnt want to give me rep so I left it at that! good luck to her in the maw!
[0:38:20] Kurama__95: I feel like having a paragon mount for Ven'ari rep was just Blizz being spiteful LUL
[0:38:32] anker_jym: I think I maxed out her rep at the very end, but it was definitely a slog. They did a good job at making The Maw feel like actual hell lol
[0:38:43] josykay89: is it just me, or is the hat from the cosmetic set the hardest one to get? I have done countless digging events. got the mount, and the entire rest of the set. no hat though
[0:39:07] Terra___l: @HazelNuttyGames do you think we will ever get dryads as a playable race since now we know the come out from nuts?
[0:39:08] fallingupwards: I never got the venari paragon mount :( I don't wanna go back lol
[0:39:27] Zuldak: 10k
[0:39:33] jgbrit: I did Ven'aris damn paragon cache about 7 times and she still refused to give me that mount
[0:39:41] baroner25: 14k ish
[0:39:44] msmester1: on problem i have with this rep why dint they put the vendor here?
[0:39:57] anker_jym: It makes me feel sad, I wanted to enjoy Shadowlands, and there were some things I did enjoy, but also lots of things that left a bad taste. But I won't go into further details, since I know you enjoyed it, Hazel, and that's perfectly fine :)
[0:40:56] AslanDaGr8: Seller NPC should be where the event is happening :s
[0:41:06] freckle_twitch: When you do the WQ in Forbidden Reach, I think you can get credit towards the "Goggle Wobble" achievement if you /dance with Zenata BEFORE starting the WQ.
[0:41:06] Kretyn: @saviorofazeroth the majority of players feel this way, you're not alone :)
[0:41:09] amaya21: hey Kira <3
[0:41:31] josykay89: they should have some "assist-vendor" hanging around at the dig side
[0:41:33] Cyberwolffe: I'm about 650 fragments from getting the vendor mount from the archives
[0:42:03] anker_jym: @kretyn that's true. It was just so weird for me to not enjoy an expansion overall. I've loved every other one they've put out. But now it's in the past, and the future of WoW is looking bright!!
[0:42:43] josykay89: was unable to do the google worldquests... for some reason i just never got the googles but it was on day one. were some of the stuff was seemingly bugged
[0:42:50] nishnishish: that questline is nojoke
[0:43:24] fallingupwards: You can talk to the no
[0:43:32] fallingupwards: Npc to get goggles
[0:43:58] fallingupwards: She should be marked with a yellow dot
[0:43:59] freckle_twitch: If you use "regular" flying mounts in Zaralek Caverns, you won't get targeted and shot down in the nasty western area!
[0:44:07] josykay89: yes. but he did not have the option to hand me some goggles
[0:44:08] amaya21: drops are today?
[0:44:12] josykay89: she
[0:44:12] msmester1: the better question is why dont make the googles a toy or something
[0:44:15] cashthb: I don't
[0:44:19] Zuldak: No, i dont think anyone enjoyes the hard area
[0:44:22] Kurama__95: Hazel, are you going to go after the Evoker legendary in S4? Kappa
[0:44:37] Zuldak: the mobs have a stacking debuff that can blow up even well geared tanks
[0:44:45] nishnishish: I enjoyed it =)
[0:44:46] azrazil720: I agree, that area sucks
[0:44:48] phlodfire: i can’t say i love them, but i do often slog through, bitterly as well
[0:44:54] msmester1: these world quests are the reason why i hate playing classes that dont have a drop combat button
[0:44:57] NovemberFifth: I think they are meant to encourage grouping for social players
[0:44:57] Lunarphor: it also doesnt help they all look the same in dragonflight
[0:45:03] firencider: Zaralek is a great idea in theory...
[0:45:05] anker_jym: What if Kira tells you to? Can she make you?
[0:45:07] sence_00: @josykay89 are they in your bag already maybe? I think you just hang on to them
[0:45:12] heldtheline: I kinda like the challenge sometimes, as someone who likes to tackle things solo.
[0:45:25] GreenArrowed: i only do it for the bigger ones that make it faster
[0:45:27] firencider: They overtuned the rares, dont have any drops so it doesnt feel rewarding or farm worthy...
[0:45:36] wolfcloudchaser80: That's when you have a tank class/spec ready. Tanks can do those solo pretty readily.
[0:45:38] Zuldak: One of the main reasons i do M+ and raid is to get gear so i can feel uber powerful as i go around slapping helpless mobs in world questing. This area ruins that fantasy
[0:45:41] Daemavand: I just dislike gameplay/events that feel like a slog and I'm pushed into doing it, be it group or solo
[0:45:49] msmester1: they should just layer everyone together in an area
[0:46:26] GreenArrowed: once i got wrathion to exalted i stopped going
[0:46:35] Zuldak: the blackscale keep area was not nearly as dangerous as THIS
[0:46:46] Zuldak: this place is actual mortal danger
[0:46:58] Zuldak: and everything has so much hp
[0:47:16] msmester1: i only tried 1 pet battle world quest and a mulock kinda guy just wiped the floor with me LUL
[0:47:35] SaraDivine: i did the wrathion zone while the try hards were farming because there was so many people there which made it easier in that way
[0:47:45] yggdrasil_91: whats the addon on the right side?
[0:48:22] HazelNuttyGames: !xufu
[0:48:22] Streamlabs: Find lists of most-used pets, import teams, look up strategies and more on https://www.wow-petguide.com/
[0:48:40] Perkolate: tried out enshrouded for all of 10 minutes, got some error upon logging in repeatedly, apparently a hotfix is in the works. back to palworld!
[0:48:54] Zuldak: did you ever see Blues Clues as a kid?
[0:49:31] Zuldak: also lots of devs have been tweeting pirate flags lately... they are up to something
[0:49:32] msmester1: gnome shaman
[0:49:32] lazytitanex: Do u get bored playing wow? I always end up resting a few weeks before the next patch.
[0:49:49] wolfcloudchaser80: Apparently Enshrouded is getting blasted in Steam reviews because so many errors and poor performance.
[0:49:54] sarrowzthewarlock: wow been a while since i tuned in hello
[0:50:01] JMan31337: any idea when the 6-12 month sub promo ends?
[0:50:04] GreenArrowed: kul tiran only
[0:50:10] SaraDivine: he lives out in a cabin in the woods now. somewhere on the east coast i think? very beautiful. he posts on instagram sometimes.
[0:50:16] Zuldak: Yberra said no pirates. What he meant was 'No, Pirates!'
[0:50:20] GreenArrowed: nono then you're just an undead priate
[0:50:22] Perkolate: Blizzard Hire This Woman!
[0:50:25] nyrhalahotep: And it's an RP server so you have to talk like a pirate
[0:50:34] cashthb: ngl sounds pretty stale
[0:50:46] JMan31337: the Blood Sail server?
[0:50:50] GreenArrowed: @nyrhalahotep you auto talk like a pirate
[0:50:56] nishnishish: That would be a great ending to the game, walk the plank
[0:50:59] bearhybrid: ohhh doin the new archaeology thing!
[0:51:07] msmester1: where do i find the motivation to do world quests im so behind reps :(
[0:51:12] amaya21: @Perkolate Enshrouded had an update, I updated my graphics card and I play right now, hope it will work for you now :)
[0:51:17] nyrhalahotep: @GreenArrowed Even better 😂
[0:51:29] GreenArrowed: @msmester1 get some contracts and do the ones you actually like doing
[0:51:56] Rzzorblade: Where did you pick up this daily
[0:52:05] bearhybrid: when I did these they were suuuuuuuper buggy
[0:52:39] SaraDivine: i start to think of doing something like that as discipline instead of waiting for motivation. which helps me just do it lol
[0:53:18] nishnishish: Any idea if the opening quest chain in acct wide?
[0:53:28] AslanDaGr8: you do only Gold world quests?
[0:53:34] nishnishish: same
[0:53:40] littymctt: it is
[0:53:44] garndal: digging the new dig public event
[0:53:48] nishnishish: that'sa bummer deal there
[0:53:53] nyrhalahotep: KITTEHHHHHHH
[0:54:01] witchhobbit: the last pet i need for zookeeper title i need to wait until summer time hazelCry  something to look forward to tho i guess
[0:54:26] nishnishish: if you dont do the quest chain or on a busy sever it's hard to tap the  mining nod
[0:54:42] Zuldak: yay mog
[0:54:55] msmester1: when does the season end just started plaing again a week ago i dont even know if i should do anything
[0:55:06] Zuldak: you like time rift over super bloom?
[0:55:31] Daemavand: Exactly lol
[0:55:37] msmester1: time rift is the best one of the events
[0:55:47] phlodfire: so can confirm, azerothian archives world quests are not account wide. looks like you have to do chain on each alt
[0:55:50] amaya21: Hazel do you have drops on?
[0:56:02] lumaday: same i really enjoyed time rifts. easy collecting
[0:56:04] Zuldak: superbloom gives you a ton of dreamwarden rep and completes the worthy ally which gives 1500 gold plus extras
[0:56:09] thordallim: what is the time rift ytou are spekaing about?  been away for some time
[0:56:10] Zuldak: thats why i do super blooms over rifts
[0:56:12] Daemavand: I think my favorite world event was the demon invasion for the Legion pre-patch
[0:56:37] witchhobbit: i liked the first df events in each zone
[0:56:46] msmester1: is the time rift repatable or weekly?
[0:56:58] Zuldak: @Daemavand there are also timed legion invasions of various zones in broken shores
[0:57:03] VenomUVN: haven't played since like 4 months into this xpack I loved it but didn't have time
[0:57:09] OffDutyGaming: have a wonderful day Miss Nutty
[0:57:10] phlodfire: “Unparalleled” title at exalted with Sidormi time rifts
[0:57:12] VenomUVN: I should come back
[0:57:13] Zuldak: err broken isles
[0:57:14] HeyKairhys: rep tokens too!
[0:57:36] Daemavand: @zuldak you're right, and idk why but they don't feel the same at all
[0:58:05] msmester1: time to get gill'dan
[0:58:16] Daemavand: Oof my flight home tonight got cancelled because of weather D:
[0:58:28] cashthb: encapsulated destiny can definately give special costmetics, most of the time it gave me special cosmetics
[0:58:30] SaraDivine: i spammed heroic/normal dawn of the infinite. 300 rep per boss i think it was
[0:58:31] firencider: If you have an alt that hasnt done it, you can get another 1k from the intro quest to the rift
[0:58:57] supashanka: caverns of times?
[0:58:58] phlodfire: can also do the weekly time rift quest on alts and send the rep as account bound.
[0:59:26] firencider: the weekly i think is account
[0:59:35] firencider: but there is the intro 1k token you get
[0:59:40] reaping_outlaws: It is
[0:59:44] phlodfire: they didnt used to, but at least for the last few weeks i was doing it that way
[0:59:48] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[0:59:55] nishnishish: Are you sure?  Its always been acct wide for me
[1:00:02] phlodfire: that’s how i got title last week
[1:00:03] lumaday: I dont know if the weekly being account wide was a bug or not
[1:00:06] cashthb: get an other account, do the weekly then ask support to merge them
[1:00:15] Daemavand: This must be scienced to find out lol
[1:00:31] Zuldak: the lich king boss used to destroy the poor pugs
[1:01:00] Yigolo2: Does the legendary have anything to do with that?
[1:01:10] Hippwn: I really love they can dragon fly normally now it is so great
[1:01:35] cashthb: yeah
[1:01:51] PIZZAPOWERS: i also left my evoker (dps tho) after my guildie got the legendary and then stopped playing. I still never got it
[1:02:15] PIZZAPOWERS: yeah PogChamp
[1:02:35] lumaday: That is what I am experiencing with the axe right now
[1:02:38] Zuldak: it's gotten a LOT of buffs because people don't see it as powerful
[1:03:02] rockagone: hey hazel
[1:03:08] ChappyAir: Probably a stupid question but i just recently started doing big group stuff in wow. How am i supposed to click to target a mob in superbloom? There are so many nameplates around :D
[1:03:18] cashthb: they served y'shaarj, every insectoid race was the servant of an old god, like how the nerubian served Yogg Saron and them being on the south of the world in the ww makes no sense :)
[1:03:38] phlodfire: tab target

[1:03:56] ChappyAir: well :D So just AoE spells
[1:04:05] wolfcloudchaser80: @ChappyAir There's a UI option to select between overlapping nameplates and stacking nameplates. Stacking may be easier for you
[1:04:24] ChappyAir: But you are right. Superbloom is super dull. Just run behind the tree an wait for the event to complete
[1:04:29] ChappyAir: @wolfcloudchaser80 cheerws

[1:07:03] Skrewtaype: Depends on the car really.
[1:07:04] msmester1: depends on the car
[1:07:06] ntdrongo: what type of car
[1:07:08] Zuldak: it depends on the car. Some you need to take it apart
[1:07:10] sence_00: i think a mechanic has to do it because they relate to the crumple zone
[1:07:11] asurrraaa: depends.
[1:07:15] Skrewtaype: If you go to a parts store, they usually do it for you for free.
[1:07:22] josykay89: to be fair, on modern cars it is often painful
[1:07:23] ntdrongo: i'm absolutely useless with cars and i can do my own
[1:07:25] asurrraaa: new ? get someone else because of all the wiring. old ? eh do it ya self.
[1:07:26] msmester1: yeah get someone to do it
[1:07:26] fallingupwards: Not to replace the housing
[1:07:42] ntdrongo: maybe different in australia
[1:07:50] asurrraaa: what make is the car ? don’t say the model if you’re afraid.
[1:07:56] Zuldak: If its a car newer than 2005 i would say its probably a little bit of work
[1:08:01] LennieGamesCo: I've never had someone else replace a bulb. It's just like a normal light bulb, you just need to be able to reach to where it goes
[1:08:28] Zuldak: man... cars made before 2004 are now considered classic D:
[1:08:38] asurrraaa: If you feel comfortable removing a front bumper , you can change a headlight.
[1:08:42] MomoWC: Rule of thumb is if the car isn't old enough to vote, it's probably worth going to someone unless you're technically/mechanically inclined
[1:08:45] Zuldak: I think i reject that... the 2004 ford taurus is not a classic
[1:08:59] asurrraaa: 😂😂😂
[1:09:02] cashthb: there are people working for lego... that's just unfair
[1:09:09] ntdrongo: how do the mounts that you give to opposite faction work
[1:09:20] Zuldak: Hazel nutty and bolty streams
[1:09:21] asurrraaa: Also are you referring to the headlight housing or just the bulb inside ?
[1:09:31] Perkolate: congrats! thats a good one
[1:10:16] msmester1: gz
[1:10:47] josykay89: never understood why he is not a pet
[1:10:48] TiPera: whats ur favorite toy?

[1:13:04] toesmagee: shackle undead too for the other one right?
[1:13:12] wolfcloudchaser80: And you've clued me into a few fun things to collect I didn't know about on these streams, too.
[1:13:13] asurrraaa: I tried mind control but I turned into it lol.
[1:13:20] asurrraaa: ahhh dominate is the one !
[1:13:40] TiPera: is that mount new?
[1:13:43] wolfcloudchaser80: And a couple of times, you didn't know it, but we were racing to collect something. You beat me to Otto by a few minutes.
[1:13:44] TiPera: the one u're currently riding
[1:13:45] asurrraaa: I tried mind control in a 18+ and turned into the dam thing LOL
[1:13:55] bearhybrid: I just got the InvestiGator's pocket watch last night. So fun that it can be on 24/7 if you want. Expecting blizz to nerf the duration lol

[1:18:50] anker_jym: It makes sense in the lore. Varian Wrynn was part of a gladiator team with Broll Bearmantle and Valeera Sanguinar back when he had amnesia
[1:19:03] GreenArrowed: a good way to learn is by downloading one and just looking at how it's put together
[1:19:14] GreenArrowed: yes
[1:19:22] anker_jym: Yes, him lol
[1:19:35] chuma_22: your hair grew back !

[1:21:13] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:23:01] sence_00: Im almost at 3/5 with their rep but idk what the point is
[1:23:11] calessira: WOW the wig is so adorable!!!
[1:24:55] cashthb: most df felt that way for me
[1:24:58] mmac27: that candlestick is as big as ur character
[1:25:56] XugieXugo: I gave up on doing all of the achievements. I have roughly 37k points. I just focus on pets mostly, think i'm missing maybe 20 ish pets of all that can be gotten currently.
[1:27:03] sence_00: if you did a stream raid group for Cobalt we could do it in one session I think
[1:27:06] XugieXugo: Truth be told, you are the reason why I even gotten into collecting pets. used your guides for the celestial fights in mop years ago.
[1:27:17] Hippwn: The one I don't have is the suffused shield seems extra rare
[1:27:59] mmac27: i was very excited to get the mount from the Researcher under fire last night & I got the drop one from the big dig on my try CoolCat
[1:28:45] msmester1: i might be the only guy i like my current trasmog so much i havent changed it in years LUL
[1:29:59] Arabany: Shaman healer or monk healer, monk or shaman? :)
[1:30:44] Swordman117: Monk healer wins because you get to Spin
[1:31:00] Arabany: yes, I've never really tried a monk
[1:31:06] judgejewls: Would be awesome if Blizzard sold 3D prints of your characters.
[1:31:20] McScooterson: @judgejewls they did once upon a time
[1:31:26] supashanka: WoW rule from back in pre-wotlk "if it spins, it wins."
[1:31:32] heldtheline: I've been levelling a monk and it's worth it to remember to do the enlightenment quests every 5 levels for the extra rested xp.

[1:31:58] Dunedain1305: It's a rogue set!
[1:31:59] Swordman117: I think thats an old old one
[1:32:00] ExArthor: lol
[1:32:05] GreenArrowed: oh, i don't like that
[1:32:08] sence_00: no wrath era
[1:32:11] judgejewls: @thordallim !!! :-)
[1:32:20] XugieXugo: there is a pinkish recolor of that set.
[1:32:24] cashthb: oh girl, if you'd see it on a worgen
[1:32:28] calessira: well it certainly is unique
[1:32:31] RuesenHV: ulduar set
[1:32:32] sence_00: those 3D prints were from a 3rd party that didnt have full rights to the IP i think
[1:32:41] Swordman117: Hazel's extreme reaction means I might have to go farm up that set now lol
[1:34:40] wolfcloudchaser80: It's like running a credit check on random people on the street!

[1:35:32] FrostDBeers: this is some cyberpunk level of stuff
[1:35:36] nishnishish: does that extra action button ever work for you the one where you gathered info on the intro quests? It never works for me out there

[1:38:58] DanHalen84: Who does your tattoos?  Love the nature.
[1:39:10] cashthb: it tends to be buggy, like I remember having more kills than honorable kills or something like that

[1:41:52] Rugmanimus: Hazel good morning! Hey I was wondering if you knew a good site or place where players can go to get the newest Recruit A Friend Rewards from other new or returning players?
[1:42:02] cashthb: poorzel
[1:42:30] wolfcloudchaser80: I wonder when this stat page started? Maybe I/we earned some portion of the gold before it started tracking
[1:42:54] cashthb: @wolfcloudchaser80 like in wotlk
[1:43:03] wolfcloudchaser80: Because it says 860k earned on my main, too, and that sounds way low for a toon made on day one of WoW in 2004.
[1:43:56] msmester1: it says not all time eraned gold but most gold owned at the same time
[1:44:22] cashthb: buy tokens and craft a billion!
[1:44:57] stayinallive: good afternoon Hazel
[1:46:13] msmester1: starting late i feel like professions are just a waste of money now Sadge
[1:46:34] asurrraaa: is that craft all an add on or just part of the game ?
[1:46:37] cashthb: you had like a mil on this char anyway
[1:46:44] McScooterson: hmm, is there a research cap? just finished one wq and the other is giving gold now instead of fragments
[1:46:45] JMan31337: I have never been good with gold since wrath and every time I try using the AH I just end up unsubscribing from boredom
[1:46:52] Bliksumschicht: hi hazel! No palworld today? :)
[1:46:53] loenhart: wow nice
[1:46:59] Afraithe: Gold aquired isnt that picked up gold?
[1:47:13] wolfcloudchaser80: [Most gold ever owned] is right for me, but [Total gold acquired] is off
[1:47:27] asurrraaa: @msmester1 crafting yeah but I’ve made a bit of gold just gathering lol.
[1:47:39] wolfcloudchaser80: @Afraithe Now THAT might be the answer
[1:47:46] Kubwa7: no, there is specifically a "gold looted"
[1:47:49] azrazil720: so, I joined pretty late in the expansion, I know you're probably not an expert but do you think it's still worth trying to max out a profession for making money?
[1:47:49] WithKilian: are you excited for the war within?
[1:47:54] Kubwa7: 3rd one down on statistics
[1:48:21] Arabany: Pretty much noone likes crafting orders.
[1:48:26] Afraithe: Gold squired is from quests?
[1:48:32] asurrraaa: Will everyone’s professions reset to lv0 when war within drops ?
[1:48:36] stayinallive: most likely from quests
[1:48:36] BuchBay: Is there a new gold sink vendor?
[1:48:38] JMan31337: trying to figure out TSM and the new crafting was a giant killer in dragon flight
[1:48:43] Kubwa7: trading between characters, maybe?
[1:48:46] Afraithe: no there is a gold from quest reward too
[1:48:55] Bliksumschicht: Theres a different one for gold from quests
[1:48:56] azrazil720: squired might be from selling to vendors?
[1:49:02] ghostie1995: I’ve been struggling to find what’s craft sim says is profitable to make
[1:49:07] azrazil720: acquired*
[1:49:30] phlodfire: do you think we will see another squish for war within?

[1:49:55] azrazil720: what add on do you use for seeing the profit for crafting? 😮
[1:50:01] jandemain: they said they'll do a squish in midnight
[1:50:08] ghostie1995: ah ok so if it’s green I’ll probably make it
[1:50:11] stayinallive: awwwwww soooo cute
[1:50:22] HazelNuttyGames: !gold
[1:50:22] Streamlabs: there's a complete guide to how I make gold crafting in Dragonflight here! https://youtu.be/WulTpPCmq9w
[1:50:34] azrazil720: I will be watching that after stream lol
[1:51:01] comemorning: im so tired of winter that i am ordering seeds
[1:51:13] CPT_Lemons: I think you still can't queue for dungeons or LFR cross faction though
[1:51:35] furiforever: I thought that was my discord but couldn't find a message, i was confused until you said that lol
[1:51:42] xoalena: how are you liking palworld?
[1:51:46] TSandrz: i use to be on the hardcore of things back in the day, but with life being a casual player is way better for me. does it really matter which faction is better?
[1:51:47] msmester1: craftsim should show the craft time LUL
[1:51:50] stayinallive: are you doing to play SOD ph2?
[1:52:02] xoalena: i have been thinking about buying it but i'm not sureee
[1:52:10] Arabany: Crafting is still faction based, work orders.  Besides playing on a server where everyone is of the opposite side is not fun.
[1:52:28] ladygagatha: what is your favorite mount
[1:52:57] stayinallive: oh wow
[1:53:00] Rezin79: That's my favorite mount.  I use it on my main all the tiem
[1:53:08] ladygagatha: ready for my free spectral tiger
[1:53:20] cashthb: what about alien isolation? it's pretty similar to palworld, if I twist the facts hard enoguh - as usual
[1:53:25] stayinallive: yes plz
[1:53:31] asurrraaa: how much is the vendor and transmog miunt from pandaria ?
[1:53:31] azrazil720: I love my bumblebee mount ❤️
[1:53:41] asurrraaa: I just got the 20k gold one and it took a toll on my gold 😂
[1:53:42] cinhotlanta: I keep a file of my theme mounts for my various toons based on their mog ;)
[1:53:55] asurrraaa: goddd dammmmm LOL. one day one day
[1:54:15] mmac27: my favorite is my Swift Zulian Tiger I got way back in the day when it still dropped
[1:54:19] azrazil720: am I the only one that wishes you could have character specific favorite mounts?
[1:54:27] asurrraaa: In surprised wow doesn’t have an add on or option of a random mount
[1:54:34] asurrraaa: random dragon. random ground. random flying. etc etc
[1:54:48] stayinallive: what would be your most proudest grind in WOW?
[1:54:49] McScooterson: Do you remember what addon it was to set mounts to zones?
[1:54:54] marbared: Oh, we saw the first legendary axe in our heroic kill last week! we're about 50% ret pallies (or so it seems) but at least it has started.
[1:54:57] heldtheline: @azrazil720 You're not the only one. I wish we could have saved profiles for mounts, toys, and pets per character.
[1:55:08] asurrraaa: I DIDNT KNOW THAT !!!
[1:55:18] asurrraaa: I had it favorited and thought it was only for favorites. that’s SICK
[1:55:36] asurrraaa: I’ll remove my favorites and only use that. thank you !!
[1:56:04] asurrraaa: I was wanting something like ffxiv random mount roulette but was bummed because I thought it had to be favorited in WoW
[1:56:05] hulksballs: Helloooo!
[1:56:10] cinhotlanta: Yeah, and some of my favorite mounts have names that make them hard to find again without blasting through the mounts list
[1:56:11] Dunedain1305: I just gor the legendary! xF
[1:56:14] msmester1: i got the 500 worldquest achivemnt NotLikeThis
[1:56:28] hulksballs: I just got the Legendary today too!! Haha :D A good day
[1:56:30] Dunedain1305: thx I'm happy xD
[1:56:44] eielwind: the bad luck protection is kicking in
[1:56:45] eielwind: lol
[1:56:56] eielwind: freeeeehold?
[1:57:02] stayinallive: ive yet to see the axe drop for me on my pally
[1:57:07] cinhotlanta: My luck still sucks on 4 different toons :)
[1:57:12] wolfcloudchaser80: Guys, don't tell Hazel... but look at the viewers number. Nice!
[1:57:22] cashthb: how about starting vice city?
[1:57:52] cinhotlanta: Seriously
[1:58:20] msmester1: if they make a legendary it should be usable all expansion like just recraft it lol
[1:58:20] MavisSiobhan: So much of this expansion's crafting feels like too much for me.
[1:58:22] Dunedain1305: Same for me Hazel! The system for current leggo is to much! Totally agree!
[1:58:25] Rezin79: Have they announced next months Trading Post?
[1:58:27] heldtheline: The latter was something like Dragonwrath, right? The legendary with the dragon?
[1:58:27] cinhotlanta: By the time I get it I know groups to farm mats will be scarce :)
[1:58:28] rhaeneros: I liked legion legendaries. Minus the drop chance. But having many different was fun
[1:58:42] azrazil720: I've never been playing a character that can use a legendary when they were available 😂
[1:58:57] hulksballs: Yeah I only went after the Legendary as a "It'll be cool to get!" thing once a week, I did -not- act 'desperate' for it, otherwise it would just frustrate me
[1:58:58] cinhotlanta: Same
[1:59:00] stayinallive: when are PRIESTS getting their own legendary?
[1:59:13] hulksballs: So it was a great thing to get now and say "Yeppie! How fun!" a nice memory for Dragonflight, but nothing serious
[1:59:21] mdeckTV: its just annoying that my evoker legendary will be outdated by greens i can buy from the AH in season 4. i dont know where the happy medium is
[1:59:25] Kubwa7: how is it almost february?  NotLikeThis
[1:59:26] JMan31337: legendries are kind of like class quests
[1:59:44] marbared: @stayinallive Their legendary is the feeling of achievement they get from healing others!
[1:59:44] msmester1: if they make new legendarys for SOD that will be the biggest part
[1:59:59] fallingupwards: It kinda bummed me out the evoker leggo is already outdated
[2:00:13] mdeckTV: i'd be happy with that
[2:00:23] Gokai: Ooo what's that mount? Looks cool
[2:00:28] sarrowzthewarlock: i hope they have a dinar like SL for class trinket cause my luck for that was horrible
[2:00:39] Gokai: Oo thanks!
[2:00:47] ladygagatha: are there any in-game rare mounts that you don't have
[2:01:13] cashthb: do you have the swift brown horse?
[2:01:29] avatarlord: can tazavesh be soloed now?
[2:01:31] InfiniFiasco: got campfire toy ty
[2:01:33] msmester1: lol
[2:01:43] ladygagatha: I got karokta today after a millennia
[2:01:49] cashthb: same thing
[2:02:00] Schizruid: Schizruid subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[2:02:00] Streamlabs: schizruid just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:02:00] adelius3: what am I looking at...
[2:02:04] kandraven: haha i can see you at the time rift
[2:02:13] Rezin79: I just got Breezebiter yesterday!   First time drop
[2:02:16] enrih: LOL
[2:02:18] cinhotlanta: pretty funny
[2:02:18] hulksballs: Haha great reference
[2:02:20] marbared: Breezebiter's a nightmare
[2:02:22] hulksballs: Also Mulan, 10/10
[2:02:25] vandis1022: I like your dragon costume haha
[2:02:31] mmac27: you are a dragon aspect now
[2:02:31] ladygagatha: breeze biter took forever
[2:02:32] msmester1: just mount up and down it worked for me
[2:02:42] cashthb: I can just remount when that happens
[2:04:50] ladygagatha: do you ever do dragon flight pet battle videos like you used to? you got me through celestial tournament
[2:05:13] tonibeeswax: Good morning Hazel!
[2:05:34] marbared: Oh, I finished the Sordormi rep grind and thus rifts yesterday.  yay
[2:05:54] ladygagatha: do you have any new dragon flight battle pets that you really like?
[2:06:50] cashthb: the one you benched Grumpy for?
[2:06:54] malifecent1574: Can we still get Tobias? I totally forgot to do that
[2:06:58] databob1: I call him detective Puppy
[2:06:59] ladygagatha: I have really been liking kilobit 9000
[2:07:01] cinhotlanta: Glad you're still doing the raid guides, I make my own cheat sheets from them and spam the instrucxtions before raid encounters and you've surely saved dozens of wipes for me
[2:07:13] lighthalo11: starting my gold making journey to get the bloodfang widow  !!
[2:07:14] malifecent1574: ok cool, ty
[2:07:38] malifecent1574: ok, i got the other 2, but forgot about tobias lol
[2:08:23] Triskelian: Her hair reminds me of Toph's from ATLA
[2:08:43] Triskelian: Avatar: The Last Airbender :D
[2:08:48] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[2:09:03] BoogiePonderosa: hazelWave
[2:09:25] CPT_Lemons: I think there is a quest item by where the boss first spawns
[2:10:08] wolfcloudchaser80: "I got a dilated time pod" sounds like an android's medical issue.
[2:10:27] BoogiePonderosa: Jackson Pollock nails?
[2:10:41] azrazil720: it sounds like Charlie Brown saying "I got a rock" 🤣🤣
[2:10:47] cashthb: you don't know how my nails look like
[2:11:57] BoogiePonderosa: can you get a paid name change?
[2:12:05] furiforever: I switched to GladiusEX, it seems to be working better and is updated more often
[2:12:08] ladygagatha: I'm in silithus waiting for a sandstorm do they make noise when they happen?
[2:12:41] BoogiePonderosa: oh cool
[2:14:04] msmester1: oh yeah i have to loose 10 of these for the quest this week
[2:14:06] BoogiePonderosa: this place has everything!
[2:15:59] cashthb: have you tried getting a btter weapon? :)
[2:15:59] eielwind: DKs seem awfully squishy in solo shuffel from my experience
[2:16:14] lighthalo11: ive never done pvp. why is it called solo if u play with others/?
[2:16:38] lighthalo11: ahhh i see ;-;
[2:17:04] ladygagatha: if you had to spend the rest of your life in one wow zone which one would it be
[2:17:29] msmester1: is ignoring the healer a strat? or why are thy ignoring you?
[2:18:11] BoogiePonderosa: speaking of pvp vernacular.. what does "yolo" mean for Rated BG premades?
[2:18:24] thatguynamedjans: wait a minute I thought this was a pal stream?
[2:18:31] galvarcus: The Maw
[2:18:35] msmester1: you lose only once and you diband Kappa
[2:19:13] BoogiePonderosa: ok i thought it meant something like low expectations but couldn't get into any! :D
[2:19:18] cashthb: @msmester1 healers usually have more defensives than dps, better to just cc them and hope for the best.... considering they are competent, in lower brackets they never go for the healer even if it's not
[2:19:36] msmester1: this is a pal stream she heals her 2 pets dont you see
[2:20:01] 인터넷포트: I love when 1200 players attack tanky healers at 0% dampening
[2:20:26] marbared: DH looks to be a beast
[2:20:48] 인터넷포트: did DH get any updates?
[2:20:48] watchCrimson: hello Hazzel, I came to say thanks for recomending palworld, its amazing fun ^^
[2:21:43] 인터넷포트: DH should have blur
[2:21:58] thatguynamedjans: What rating are you Hazel?
[2:22:26] furiforever: Don't forget tranq, i forget i haveit because i play convoke in keys.
[2:22:43] diarrhea_lad: I've been stuck in like the 1500 range on my DK, the climb is so boring
[2:22:43] furiforever: I didnt spec into that, i knew id never push it
[2:22:51] Grumpychef: Hello Hazel, Thanks for hosting and having Drops on!
[2:24:03] FrostBeered: this is why I can't run arenas, too stressful
[2:24:13] watchCrimson: what is this arena? you get mixed with people to play with?
[2:24:24] everspells: watching that death knight's health bar gives me second hand stress lol
[2:25:52] raphelio: LUL
[2:25:59] cashthb: what if they something nice?
[2:26:01] Swordman117: Do you ever push high for Solo shuffle or just for farming pvp mounts?
[2:26:11] anker_jym: Who has time to type in chat during these matches??
[2:26:33] Swordman117: @cashthb in pvp? XD
[2:26:40] raka9601: Hi Hazel !!  i didnt know that you played pvp as well !!
[2:26:56] wolfcloudchaser80: Keep chat on, but type "I don't speak English" in some random language. Bonus points for using Esperanto.
[2:27:23] junglefever66: HAZEL!!!!!!!! love u
[2:27:56] Aseopp: Morning Hazel! I got my 2500m+ rating :D
[2:28:12] Aseopp: very excite
[2:28:18] Aseopp: Probably done
[2:28:20] stayinallive: im at 2817M+
[2:28:47] Aseopp: @stayinallive Very nice
[2:28:50] ladygagatha: are you ready for the meta achievement
[2:29:05] Aseopp: I pug so pushing past 2500 is a bit painful
[2:29:13] ladygagatha: there better be one!
[2:29:13] cinhotlanta: love the digging, this and the WQs really breathing life back into the profession, hope it looks like this going forward
[2:29:23] Aseopp: Especially as a tank
[2:29:56] thatguynamedjans: Hazel... Enshrouded came out today.... :O
[2:30:05] Aseopp: So im trying to decide how to celebrate
[2:30:07] cinhotlanta: Yep, Archaeology
[2:30:17] stayinallive: @Aseopp thank you  :D  Prot pally is OP this season
[2:30:19] thatguynamedjans: It says up to 16 people
[2:30:25] eielwind: too many games too little time
[2:30:41] Aseopp: @stayinallive Yea, that is my main :D
[2:30:45] anker_jym: What's Enshrouded? I know nothing but WoW lol
[2:30:48] thatguynamedjans: Let me know if theres space for me, Id grab it if I have peeps to play it with :D
[2:31:06] msmester1: the cake is not a lie?
[2:31:07] thatguynamedjans: The cake is NOT a lie you mean?? :O
[2:31:11] cashthb: can I get some?
[2:31:12] junglefever66: i only watch twitch to get drops and i do dim my phone and mute the audio but i do choose who i watch Am i wrong?
[2:31:34] Rezin79: I love Valheim and I am very curious about Enshouded
[2:31:41] cinhotlanta: Cake is Truth :)
[2:31:53] stayinallive: @Aseopp im a Key pusher. i love doing M+
[2:32:06] msmester1: tiramisu? Kappa
[2:32:17] Runzi333: Oh have you seen Palia yet? it seemed like a game you might like
[2:32:18] Aseopp: I love cake
[2:32:26] galvarcus: Espresso powder + chili in chocolate chip cookies is divine
[2:32:39] junglefever66: thats why i only watch hazel cuz she’s the giga chad of wow streamers
[2:32:40] Grumpychef: cake is  a lie
[2:32:43] TezzrahGaming: Palia isnt ready for HazelNutty
[2:33:08] watchCrimson: I dont know where people keep gbringing out alcohol when it comes to what tiramisu is made of. As far as I know, there is none in it
[2:33:19] Aseopp: @stayinallive Its fun for sure, but 2500 is good for me. I got the xmog item and then learned that I did not have a helm or shoulder from raid, so if i come back it will probably be to raid a bit more
[2:33:32] thatguynamedjans: Honestly when the war within drops its gonna be so hype. Lots of things to look forward to I feel :D
[2:33:34] Frejski1: your task is to stand near eadweard for instructions
[2:33:40] Runzi333: Highly recommend Palia but yeah maybe just for fun not as a stream since it maybe is a bit slow for a stream hahaha
[2:33:51] witchhobbit: yeah theres always been some kind of alcohol in it
[2:33:56] DrThePunisher: Hazel are your stream eligible for WoW drops? I don't see it in the channel description.
[2:34:03] HazelNuttyGames: !drops

[2:34:04] galvarcus: Do you think War Within means only a war within Azeroth or conflicts within the factions?
[2:34:04] cashthb: Isn't tiramisu just gin+absinthe?
[2:34:04] witchhobbit: every recipe ive seen/heard..
[2:34:13] wolfcloudchaser80: Partner just said that yes, the ladyfingers are soaked in rum
[2:34:18] Runzi333: I would totally die trying to talk and solo shuffle hahahaha
[2:34:24] thatguynamedjans: But yeah let me know if theres any space on that server you guys are playing on, if not no worries ^__^

[2:34:54] stayinallive: my most fav dungeon of season 3 is Waycrest Manor
[2:34:56] ladygagatha: meta achievement should reward a vyranoth proto drake skin
[2:35:29] azrazil720: what meta achieve are we talking about?
[2:35:39] cashthb: so like in 2011?
[2:36:00] stayinallive: i cant get enough of that place. i love the theme of it and the music in there is a banger for me
[2:36:03] cashthb: listen to some lmfao!
[2:36:30] McScooterson: eddie bauer and roots should last ages
[2:36:32] TollBoothVideos: So are digs just new blooms?

[2:37:07] Triskelian: Wasn't there a meta achieve for BFA too?
[2:37:23] Aseopp: My fallback for sweats is to buy whatever the local university is selling. They are usually bombproof
[2:37:53] deliciousarrowslinger: heyo
[2:37:57] watchCrimson: oh yeah, speaking of doggo, where dgo cam? :D
[2:38:11] galvarcus: I like American Giant sweats and hoodies. Comfy and durable.
[2:38:35] thatguynamedjans: Pants wear out quick if you wear them every day and wash them a lot D:

[2:38:45] Streamlabs: mokorii just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:38:49] Aseopp: I understand. I am not fond of the institution i attended tbh
[2:39:01] ladygagatha: I hope we get to see a collaboration between azshara and denathrius. most smug iconic villain duo in wow.
[2:39:08] TezzrahGaming: As someone who got a music degree, and ended up doing software in the senior living field... you dont do much with the degree lol
[2:39:13] cinhotlanta: A little
[2:39:26] cashthb: having a degree is still a flex
[2:39:35] itshexi69: Hey Hazel.  im a very avid key player, but want to dabble more into collecting everything but feel very overwhelmed. How would you start this process? I do have All The Things already
[2:39:43] Aseopp: @TezzrahGaming agreed, but it made me a better human
[2:40:00] deliciousarrowslinger: deliciousarrowslinger subscribed with Prime.

[2:40:27] cashthb: i did spend a lot of money on degrees and they are useless... but I can flex with them!
[2:40:37] TezzrahGaming: @Aseopp also true
[2:40:57] itshexi69: Thank you!
[2:41:10] McScooterson: the att wheel of random sometimes helps
[2:41:18] azrazil720: I just got my Imagiwing and I love her very much!
[2:41:57] watchCrimson: would you be up for Drakthyr to have different races for their vissage? My biggest problem with the vissage is that it is like 4th race to be bloodelf model
[2:42:01] iFFy2010: love your wekely saturday vlogs.
[2:42:07] KellMG96: sup gang
[2:42:08] nisuunlite: Had to move to another Region now new WoW Account no idea where to start
[2:42:11] momentum1986: what’s ATT wheel of random?
[2:42:25] TezzrahGaming: gnome visage supremacy
[2:42:26] Kubwa7: depends on what you have a degree in :P  I have two...one of them let me work in a lab..the other was in nursing, which is required to do the job
[2:42:31] Runzi333: If I could be a fox dragon I'd never play anything else lol
[2:42:32] comemorning: might as well get an art degree. hazel its never too late to go to school. (63 y/o art student in an art university)
[2:42:40] huffy_bird: same for undead please, unlock all the races
[2:42:44] Swordman117: Night Elf Visage is on my War within wishlist
[2:43:09] anker_jym: You had the best one at the beginning of the expansion though: Tuskarr visage!!
[2:43:12] goplacidly56: I missed what you said this add on is
[2:43:21] momentum1986: niice. I need to use that. haven’t logged in in several weeks and need a jolt or inspiration
[2:43:22] goplacidly56: Oh all the things?
[2:43:37] thatguynamedjans: I have the AOTC moose :D
[2:43:43] cashthb: yeah, to be serious: the education 100% worth it, if not even for the knowledge, the connections you build are really important - atleast in tech
[2:43:44] azrazil720: grove defiler is pretty easy except for one or two I think
[2:43:49] azrazil720: unless they changed it
[2:43:49] Mosspixie: You mentioned it's easier to get the Insane title now. How is it easier now? I might try my best to get it this time. :)
[2:43:58] BuchBay: ALL! the things
[2:44:01] witchhobbit: how does one go about doing old glory raid achieves? they intimidate me
[2:44:11] itshexi69: My main is a monk this expansion and im very attached to her so im focusing on trying to get all cool leather transmogs and mounts
[2:44:14] rpere034: why?
[2:44:15] BoogiePonderosa: there is a mount for amirdrassil aotc?
[2:44:21] Triskelian: I really believe you need a group to do the glow worm achieve for Glory of the Legion Raider
[2:44:26] sence_00: I think all of the Legion Raider achieve is soloable but the ones ive tried are very tedious
[2:44:31] deliciousarrowslinger: its more fun with more people
[2:44:46] BoogiePonderosa: ahhh
[2:44:56] momentum1986: medical school was useful, expensive but useful. the real learning for me was at the bedside with patients in the 2nd and 3rd year, plus residency and fellowship.
[2:45:14] sence_00: if you mean Buggy Fight it can be soloed
[2:45:16] Triskelian: No offhand, but it's from the Emerald Nightmare
[2:45:23] sence_00: I did about a month ago
[2:45:29] Triskelian: That's the one!
[2:45:51] wolfcloudchaser80: Magpies in Waking Shores!
[2:45:56] Aseopp: @momentum1986 That sounds like something a good doc would say :)
[2:46:10] deliciousarrowslinger: easier with guildies
[2:46:36] ladygagatha: are you missing any dragon customizations that you really want
[2:47:11] helheimr: its currently bugged for those that bought it before it was a toy
[2:47:14] cashthb: also there are a lot of ones that need more peeps, like the hellfire citadel teron'gor have to eat someone and it can't eat the tank
[2:47:28] watchCrimson: I hope they will make it possible to block the clothing to hange into my proffeson gear when I do the proffesion. I like my Mog, dont change it for me
[2:47:32] helheimr: and blizz nerfed it so it isnt a toggle anymore, its on an hour cd and you loose the buff when you die
[2:47:54] FrostDBeers: they turned the randomizer manuscript into an account wide toy instead of a skill for each character
[2:47:55] ellasky: @helheimr Hopefully they put out a fix soon
[2:47:59] FrostDBeers: yeah
[2:48:32] helheimr: @ellasky i have lost faith in blizz fixing old bugs, so hopefully soon or nevermore
[2:49:05] Triskelian: @watchCrimson I don't think there's a choice for that, but you can talk to someone in the Ruby Lifepools so you change back into your regular mog when you're done crafting
[2:49:38] azrazil720: Dracthyr flying actually saves a vigor because it launches you when you cast it 😅
[2:49:51] MavisSiobhan: Yep, she's also in the capital near the Tailor trainers.
[2:49:51] heldtheline: At the tauren who fixes the whelping's toy.
[2:49:53] eielwind: you can right click the buff after ur done crafting and u take it off
[2:50:14] Runzi333: Yeah gotta say I love soar a lot now
[2:50:18] KinosJourney: I have that disabled but it still changes it, gotta right click the buff every time 😶
[2:50:32] Mosspixie: The tauren is in Valdrakken too to change the profession clothes too, she is sitting at the crafting area. :)
[2:50:42] Aseopp: Was there news about the survival game?
[2:51:01] wolfcloudchaser80: Yeah, I absolutely love flying on my Dracthyr
[2:51:06] Aseopp: Yea, the blizzard one... ok, i must have misread something earlier
[2:51:10] Nnamu: look at ol' icarus over here
[2:51:30] Rozzik: Are they going to introduce any new classes for Dracthyr?
[2:51:52] blueboywiz: I’m going to try and see if I can do an rbg today with only evokers. let’s see how this goes…
[2:51:57] Nnamu: can you explain how crafting with the enchanted crest thing works if im not a crafter? i see people say that you should use it to gear an alt
[2:52:04] Runzi333: It's so nice now I've just been scooting around actually enjoying flying since they fixed it hahaha the ten second cooldown being from when you take off is WAY better too
[2:52:06] Triskelian: @Rozzik Fingers crossed
[2:52:31] Runzi333: Also sorry I type slow lol
[2:53:07] MonsterMommaBear: heya Hazel and company :)
[2:53:31] Aseopp: hazelVoid
[2:53:44] Nnamu: oh wow thanks its that easy, i should have learned this a long time ago lol
[2:53:51] BoogiePonderosa: is there an easy way to keep toolbars in the same arrangement across talent builds?
[2:53:52] katcore: i think i lost a lot of gold last week by crafting primal convergent the price dropped A LOT :(
[2:53:53] stayinallive: do you think that in season 4. will we have all 8 dragonflight dungeons?
[2:53:55] GhostReapersWorld: Drake would by the same level as simple Sparl gear
[2:54:20] Vattss: I just gear all 13 alts (all classes) simultaneously with m+
[2:54:26] BoogiePonderosa: er.. the spells move around.. the bars dont change i guess
[2:54:28] jonesy369: I wish I’d understood that about the crafting gear stuff :/
[2:54:29] MonsterMommaBear: i am tired, little one keeping me busy, but I finally got all the druid forms (minus the mythic BBQ birb form)
[2:54:42] hexapho: @BoogiePonderosa yes there is, you can click on the cog wheel for the different talent builds, and there will be an option to save bars
[2:54:46] helheimr: but it isnt eight dragonflight dungeons, is it? where the Dawn of the Infinites get in there?
[2:54:48] wolfcloudchaser80: @katcore I think an issue is that so few people buy silver convergent now. People only want gold.
[2:54:48] eielwind: the new 441 BoA stuff for flightstones is neat
[2:54:50] helheimr: its the most fun one!
[2:54:54] Triskelian: @BoogiePonderosa What Hazel said, if you save a UI build, you can use it across all your characters
[2:55:28] McScooterson: wasn't the last season all the mega dungeons?
[2:55:29] deliciousarrowslinger: when is season 3 over?
[2:56:19] hexapho: the best guess is mid march
[2:56:35] dergNwolf: they mentioned dragonflight dungeons in their Season 4 preview post
[2:56:46] Nnamu: how many maxed professions do you have in df
[2:56:48] dergNwolf: so it'd be very weird if it wasn't
[2:57:11] ChristieB: ChristieB subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[2:57:11] Streamlabs: christieb just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:57:15] BoogiePonderosa: @hexapho ok thx i'll have to look into that because my spells move to diff keybinds based on where they were when i saved the build
[2:57:44] Nnamu: @BoogiePonderosa i think theres an option to turn that off when you save the build
[2:58:03] BoogiePonderosa: @Nnamu cool!
[2:58:09] TbTnH: but the feat of strenght fomo..
[2:58:15] stayinallive: would you like to see if for a season of M+. we would get pass seasons affixs like Prideful and reaping awakened. and would you do it
[2:58:43] Kurama__95: I would do Cryptic in a heartbeat, goated affix
[2:58:46] DrThePunisher: ew
[2:58:57] Aseopp: I actually like the absence of seasonal affixes
[2:59:01] dergNwolf: you mean having them be fun?
[2:59:08] PeModyne: previous portals from before war within will be acount wide? i know rep isnt
[2:59:14] cashthb: they should add pridefull to boss hp %-s in raids imo
[2:59:23] tyrannara: This is the first time I've pushed 20's to get all my portals! I hope they are retroactively account wide also
[2:59:26] stayinallive: what????
[2:59:28] stayinallive: lol
[2:59:34] mcxoney: i really liked the affix in bfa season 4 idk its name but it was really fun with those portal skips
[2:59:48] GyratingDog: Yeah, i miss using stuns and stuff tbh. More to do than spam AoE burst
[2:59:55] stayinallive: last week was the worst week for M+
[2:59:58] azrazil720: I've been enjoying getting to freeze trap them with my hunter 😄
[3:00:01] dknamey: people only dont like afflicted because theres classes that cant do anything about them I think
[3:00:02] dergNwolf: oh I kinda like it too, implementation could still be better to give all classes a counter
[3:00:06] tyrannara: I like the incorporeal too! It makes my hunter useful lol
[3:00:09] Aseopp: Its nice to be able to use the whole tool kit of a class, especially the utility classes
[3:00:10] Kurama__95: I just wish there was a way for every class to interact with Afflicted, otherwise it's just hybrid week
[3:00:28] cashthb: it already kinda is, or atleast up to my ksm difficulty
[3:00:29] GyratingDog: i feel like thats what M+ is already for me
[3:00:31] dergNwolf: reaping was fun but I don'T want it to ever come back cause it's just... spam
[3:00:59] Runzi333: pugging is totally hit or miss with that affix lol
[3:01:06] Perkolate: oh man skittish... sorry cant bring you need a rogue or a hunter
[3:01:27] cashthb: well... only the couple of few expansions had mythic+
[3:01:33] galvarcus: As a warlock I am the very loud weakaura for my groups
[3:01:34] Swordman117: I thought skittish was awesome
[3:01:36] Frejski1: the portal affix was kinda fun
[3:01:36] hexapho: it was just fun to watch the screen fill up, but i think todays trash its tuned enough that it would hurt, but i sorta miss teamming
[3:02:23] stayinallive: lol ok get ride of the tiran and fort affixs and use the seasonal ones as the third affixes that would put a twist on M+
[3:02:29] grieze: awakened?
[3:02:34] Runzi333: Yeah I like both mythic+ and raiding so far this expansion but as someone who doesn't get to play often I've had to do healing or I just wait in queues most of my time lol
[3:02:37] mcxoney: shadow priest is only fun in high keys
[3:02:39] GyratingDog: i gave up playing anything with ramp damage because the game seems to be all burst
[3:02:40] cashthb: 8.3 I assume
[3:02:40] hexapho: the nzoth one?
[3:02:44] Aseopp: HI Kira!
[3:02:54] dergNwolf: teeming... they did that affix so badly though. Like, remember Temple of Sethrallis in Season 2 with the void emissaries and teeming? Dreadful
[3:02:55] Frejski1: yes it was probably awakened, don't remember the name
[3:03:05] cashthb: you had to kill thingies in the portal or they spawned in at the final boss fight
[3:03:10] stayinallive: yeah the n zoth one that was a cool one
[3:03:13] cinnatoasto_: It's actually really weird. All the content creators I gravitate towards from WoW have all turned out to main priest.
[3:03:23] witchhobbit: yeah i am struggling as well with the ramp dmg classes
[3:03:31] Perkolate: seasonal affix to make everyone have to stop and do the pocopoc puzzles. break any addons/WAs that auto do it.
[3:03:53] Runzi333: lolololol
[3:03:54] cashthb: @Perkolate +1
[3:03:59] Cyberkaia_: sup!, whats that addon that show profit and stuff?
[3:04:04] Cyberkaia_: cuz its not TSM
[3:04:06] Aseopp: haha
[3:04:10] dergNwolf: @Perkolate YES
[3:04:15] HazelNuttyGames: !craftsim
[3:04:16] stayinallive: hey hey dont be king shaming our addons
[3:04:17] HazelNuttyGames: !addons
[3:04:17] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[3:04:42] Aseopp: Can you give her the mic for a second?
[3:04:44] goplacidly56: Have a good day Hazel, Kira and Moose
[3:04:44] ellasky: Bye everyone!
[3:04:49] cashthb: what about an affix that makes everyone do their magetower after the last boss
[3:04:51] Snugglybunny: Have a great day Hazel
[3:04:56] tyrannara: Love your kitty!
[3:04:56] Aseopp: Bye
[3:04:58] Perkolate: Thanks for the stream!
[3:04:59] MonsterMommaBear: o/
