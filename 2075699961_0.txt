[1:02:04] Gutstv213: do you agree with asmon that streaming is harder than a regular 9-5
[1:02:07] LordBambii: streaming is just like any other office job
[1:02:12] LordBambii: health-wise
[1:02:23] LordBambii: sitting at a desk 8 hours+
[1:02:25] pointmadness: yo have you tried those new poppi sodas? heard they are great
[1:02:25] Nightbot: yo

[1:03:00] soapbargoeshard: do you watch kai greens videos ever? i have a buddy thats not into workingout but loves watching his videos because he talks philosophically.
[1:03:01] Winttyrr: 9-5 is not a job type. it's a schedule.

[1:04:52] Tinit5190: I don't know if I could last 4 hours without picking my nose so that must be hard
[1:04:52] AlphaSimply: Whats hard it being good at it, and talking to people 12 hours a day
[1:04:59] Sqwibbie: Also there is such a vast difference in jobs. Even in the same field. I've worked a financial analyst position that was very easy and on that was very difficult. One I could do 4 hours a day the other I was doing 9-10
[1:04:59] Kenchii_0: if streaming is so easy are not everyone successful at it?
[1:05:00] TakumiXL: streaming technically has infinite potential. if ur at an office job or a shit paying job, there is almost no room to increase pay without a million strings attached. thats where you get the "soul sucking" from.
[1:05:01] ibo36361907: what is ure runes
[1:05:09] artform_: @SONII would you recommend athletic greens? 󠀀
[1:05:26] Soulaxer: The problem too is the average streamer has a wildly different experience than the top 5-10% of streamers to where it isnt even relatable either
[1:05:31] slat_ppc: payoLove
[1:05:33] frosttoe1: @SONII who are you and whathappen to sonii?? :D
[1:05:47] averyjames_: HI  SONII
[1:05:48] Mindtrick714: thats with everything
[1:05:54] Winttyrr: personally, i dont think streaming is an easy job. if i think of turning a camera on, and doing what you do, i jus picture myself going long periods of time not talking, and being so boring
[1:05:58] ibo36361907: can u show please ure runes
[1:06:01] Winttyrr: it is not a job i could do right
[1:06:11] thiccricecakeenjoyer: @tommygunz31 google kai greene grapefruit and your idol will now be ur fav cornstar
[1:06:17] B_Rize: STREAMERS HAVE IT SO HARD LUL
[1:06:18] pointmadness: Dude thats so real! I work in social media/ video editing and wake up each day and there are new trends and new shit from just overnight
[1:06:21] xZYDECOx: @SONII Hey my man, what's up? Hope your day is going good Sonii
[1:06:31] LordBambii: im sure talking to a chat all day gets tiring but it doesn't really require skills
[1:06:38] pointmadness: Social media is awful
[1:06:40] jneves95: I don't think income is directly related with how "soul-sucking" a job is - a good income can definitely make it more palatable at the end of the day, but not easier or less draining
[1:06:48] AlphaSimply: KEKW
[1:06:50] Evirity: talking to chat and staying entertaining definitely takes skills lmfao
[1:06:52] Kenchii_0: people skills are skills
[1:06:53] gabbagoombah: If it was easy, everyone would do it. Try staying engaged every day for entire streams. The social skills would drain most people.
[1:06:54] ibo36361907: DU HUNDESOHN ich hoffe deine mutter wird gefickt
[1:06:54] AlphaSimply: Do it then
[1:06:55] thisisnotanick: what  would you do  for a living if you didnt stream?
[1:07:00] seohmy: I think the important difference is no one becomes a streamer out of desperation. There's plenty of jobs people HAVE to take to make ends meet.
[1:07:01] lophtxd: @LordBambii if it doesnt require skill, why arent you doing it?
[1:07:03] offsafety: there’s skill in being entertaining lol or else everyone could do it
[1:07:05] miloxz: i want to give streaming a try when I get better internet, already a enthusiast with my setup so may as well put it to use
[1:07:08] hamsti: KEKW did u see the prime drop for the tabard of frost... its 700$ and they're giving it away for free.... ripperino
[1:07:14] EasyPeasley: I have 4 jobs, 3 kids, and 6 divorced wives and this guy says his cushy lil streaming job is harder than mine. I wish I had time to farm Arathi Basin
[1:07:14] Winttyrr: entertainment is a skill
[1:07:24] mhmmgingerbreadcookies: what do u like about acting
[1:07:39] Sheepingbag: like when you cooked
[1:07:50] Sqwibbie: My god this conversation has devolved into chat wishing they had ur job lmfao
[1:07:56] Soulaxer: I wanna knee jerk and say theres no way streaming is harder than a 9-5 but like I work from home and be BIG chillin most of the day lol
[1:07:57] Elyial: soniiCook
[1:07:57] TakumiXL: listen brother unless ur doing 85 hours a week at the oil rig welding underwater while the water crashes into you... YAINT DOIN IT RIGHT BROTHER
[1:08:01] Sheepingbag: you can be a chef extra
[1:08:01] patrocles26: !bully

[1:08:14] AlphaSimply: BASED
[1:08:14] realmalfurionsr: circle jerk
[1:08:15] hamsti: Burnout is real in every situation
[1:08:15] Kenchii_0: im a butcher and i absolutely love my job
[1:08:17] Winttyrr: a lot of people i dont think understand the difference between socializing and entertaining.
[1:08:19] hoagie117: people looovvve to get  that measurer out
[1:08:20] thiccricecakeenjoyer: @EasyPeasley damn brother u really go thru them wives brother maybe start working on you my man
[1:08:20] slat_ppc: exactly, even if its your passion, once you've done it for long enough as a JOB it gets abit tiring
[1:08:28] longandstrong01: why did the OTK tounry get cancelled?
[1:08:30] coldyair: Could one of the reasons why they canceled the otk tournament is cause none of them play SoD
[1:08:31] dan_mcpherson: damn I love my job, sounds like these guys aren't in the right line of work
[1:08:42] seohmy: You will outright say you're lucky and blessed to be in this position. Some won't bite that bullet and just cry, so kudos to you for that.
[1:08:46] Dareka1111: farm?
[1:08:53] Winttyrr: lol im a warehouse worker. i dont love my job but it's pretty easy

[1:09:05] AC1DNUK3: Want to talk about easy jobs, I drive a gravel truck for 10 hrs lmao
[1:09:11] thisisnotanick: i have a friend who works on the "legs" of oil platforms in the north sea using climbing ropes
[1:09:34] miloxz: i work in fine dining and love the interactions from my work and the social aspect of it meeting people every day
[1:09:44] hamsti: Gotta be prepared and positioned in the right place for "luck" to even be possible
[1:09:44] fuchai: i was born, im super lucky
[1:09:53] Degran: Nearly everyone who gets "lucky" was at the right place at the right time because they were grinding
[1:09:55] Sheepingbag: luck is just an excuse
[1:10:00] xZYDECOx: @AC1DNUK3 I know a guy that drives a cesspool truck 10 hours a day, he loves it
[1:10:02] thiccricecakeenjoyer: i have a friend in india that i met through him doing all my essays  for me to get a 350k+ job and he's cleaning the toilet holes for 1 dollar a day and hes super happy

[1:10:18] Tdoh__: facts
[1:10:18] B_Rize: It's all subjective
[1:10:19] OaCPhenom: Word bro, it's all about perspective
[1:10:20] Winttyrr: luck can get you noticed, but it will not make you popular. boring people arent going to maintain numbers
[1:10:22] seohmy: Oh I don't mean to discredit, I've been a long time lurker. You didn't get lucky, you grinded for years. I just mean to say that I appreciate your willingness to own the comfort of your role and not put down layman/9-5ers.
[1:10:23] ShamLV: imagine just living in poor indian family in a slum
[1:10:30] mitchp333: majority of people in North America are lucky af .
[1:10:30] fuchai: if you are alive you are 1 in over a billion, just saying
[1:10:31] rinohwow: couldve been born in EU LUL
[1:10:32] FaluranTV: comparison is the thief of joy

[1:10:43] realmalfurionsr: will that comparison create change?

[1:10:56] HammerFaust__: @miloxz youve probably seen s2 of the bear and i think after watching the spoons episode i really understand that aspect.
[1:11:00] pointmadness: Dav chapell has a bit about comparative suffering and its soooo funny
[1:11:05] xZYDECOx: Fuckmyass1988@

[1:11:09] xZYDECOx: oops
[1:11:13] Winttyrr: spriest dots are nuts rn
[1:11:13] AC1DNUK3: @xZYDECOx hell yeah man, i used to run a vacuum truck too, not a bad gig at all
[1:11:14] itsmistero: comparing is just someone projecting their envy. Everyone has the same amount of hrs in the day, stop crying that you made your life shitty
[1:11:19] artform_: @SONII would you recommend athletic greens? thinking of starting

[1:47:37] Bloodlessftw: did  you work something else out of streaming? @sonii
[1:47:50] ogMansoN: Oh, you think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, moulded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING! The shadows betray you, because they belong to me

[1:54:35] twisted_127: even if my class sucks like warrior
[1:54:49] pantsgrab__c9: Just got done watching a show on hulu, 100% recommended it to you. It is called Shogun, great watch but only two episodes out rn. @SONII
[1:54:50] ShamLV: Soni u cook?
[1:54:52] Winttyrr: hardcore killed hardcore pop. it's not a gamemode for the majority
[1:55:01] bangbangdeveloper: SoD not having any particular streamer hype is probably why it's the healthiest expression of world of warcraft. No servers are completely fucked because Asmongold decided he was going to bankstand while reacting to videos, etc. It's all just moderate streamers playing, and on different servers as well.
[1:55:12] ShamLV: what's your go to launch?
[1:55:17] doleod: soniiCook soniiCook soniiCook

[2:07:33] Zolacee: YEP
[2:07:38] hashg0dx: AB is not a fun rep to grind
[2:07:39] Tyfonius: nah i dig it
[2:07:41] hashg0dx: its actually the worst
[2:07:42] youwiththefeds: AB hype died for me after a week of it even without stv rep ngl
[2:07:44] Winttyrr: sorta. tbh i hate the bg grind
[2:07:45] SeeMoreThings: same like WSG and ashenvale tbh
[2:07:51] lildeathxd: u have any guide of warrior for sod
[2:07:53] hashg0dx: its the longest is what i mean
[2:07:57] Zolacee: damn ab is one of my favourites
[2:08:00] hashg0dx: i love AB but that grind to exalted is horrendous
[2:08:02] ekomss182: @Zolacee indeed
[2:08:04] Winttyrr: they need to drastically increase AB rep per match. it is not a rep grind that values my time
[2:08:05] Tyfonius: I don't enjoy AB so for me its perfect to still be able to get the rep
[2:08:06] rinohwow: wsg > ab all day
[2:08:06] mdiskul: at most normal ppl get to do 1 event per day
[2:08:09] Ilove_togetwet: wish they had a WSG like that
[2:08:14] Urgshnoff: Does the ashenvale event still function or nah
[2:08:18] Sqwibbie: I think they should have increased rep from AB doing it. But not made it like that. I got 3100 coins in a single run with 5 mages. thats fucking 6200 rep way too much
[2:08:20] SeeMoreThings: oh shit this is such a banger
[2:08:26] Indomitablez: Should have made it the tokens only work from revered to exalted
[2:08:28] KaptainKen: I really dont think they want SOD to feel "grindy" hence the blue note updates today where they are increase xp gain by 100% from 1-39 and decreasing gold for mount
[2:08:35] aoonkk: why u making a priest
[2:08:41] Sqwibbie: 5 mage spam is broken
[2:08:43] Pixiepantss: 3100?!?! holy
[2:08:52] macdaddigaming: Sod isnt a grindy game mode.
[2:08:53] macdaddigaming: At all
[2:09:03] KaptainKen: SOD is for us casual normies :)
[2:09:03] phailix: 1.5k is my max, dang 3k is nuts
[2:09:03] itsPerkii: Looking forward to the XP boost. Going to probably level up another toon @KaptainKen
[2:09:08] boomboompaaow: why are they adding so many gold pay walls then?
[2:09:11] Sqwibbie: @macdaddigaming agree but they killed the need to do even a single ab
[2:09:22] soapbargoeshard: gg <3
[2:09:24] Oodyny: They should make it grindy, it was lie that in vanilla, plus it would make people do something during  3months
[2:09:24] macdaddigaming: @Sqwibbie I mean sure, but people are still playing it. So what does it matter?
[2:09:28] MrSlyth: @SONII YO!
[2:09:30] uHBuse_: where is dmf right now?
[2:09:31] Kingconn223: are you planning on getting the stv mace for your warrior? according to wowhead its bis, ive been debating getting it

[2:09:34] macdaddigaming: @Sqwibbie In the grand scheme of things.
[2:09:39] cruzjc1991: i used to do yoga to this song
[2:09:42] phailix: @uHBuse_ mulgore
[2:09:43] rinohwow: does bfd reset daily?
[2:09:43] Zolacee: exactly bro
[2:09:44] Sqwibbie: @macdaddigaming actually a lot less are. Theres like 5-6 min queue times
[2:09:45] MrSlyth: they nerf Melee hunters yet
[2:09:48] Ilove_togetwet: Aggrend says STFU
[2:09:48] SnewpDawg: When new phase launched and everything was expensive and had to buy mounts and everything it felt reallllly tight on gold but as its evening out, its not bad anymore
[2:09:55] ItsVMJ: they don't know about the ashwagandha buff for warriors yet
[2:09:59] KaptainKen: Who plays warriors these days? FeelsWeirdMan
[2:10:06] skeemsquash: I’m tired of getting 2 shot by warriors lmao
[2:10:08] ogMansoN: tell them to invite my shaman
[2:10:11] Evirity: Aggrend is in my guild on crusader strike :D he pops on sometimes to talk to us
[2:10:12] macdaddigaming: @Sqwibbie Solo shuffle dps queues had 60 minute timers and still queues. o.O
[2:10:16] Tyfonius: ele shaman is dope
[2:10:22] uHBuse_: where is dmf right now?
[2:10:23] TakeMeToValhalla: here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcvhhyOawBE&t=843s
[2:10:25] Tyfonius: i love totem management
[2:10:25] Sqwibbie: @macdaddigaming both are problems
[2:10:27] Zolacee: has to be clothie
[2:10:31] Zacrilioth: i want my mount reimbursed
[2:10:37] Tyfonius: @uHBuse_ mulgore
[2:10:42] KaptainKen: No lie if wars had second wind they would be so fun. Maybe at 50 ?
[2:10:45] Evirity: oh believe me our warriors have tried lol
[2:10:46] soapbargoeshard: i think the weird part is that warrior is already an underplayed class in all versions of wow. and they still didnt add a fun thing to get hype around playing them
[2:10:53] macdaddigaming: @Sqwibbie I guess.
[2:10:53] hashg0dx: tell aggrand to let me savory deviate in shadow form
[2:10:55] hashg0dx: thank you
[2:10:57] phailix: half price I think
[2:10:58] Zacrilioth: mount is half the cost
[2:10:59] mitchp333: should be 40g
[2:11:02] twisted_127: the classic experence is warrors wreck at 60 there saving it for then
[2:11:06] mexicchilli: yo nice tshirt man !
[2:11:06] Nightbot: yo
[2:11:09] aspectoflion: back on priest hype
[2:11:14] Kingconn223: the mounts are already 40? i thought they change next week
[2:11:14] AcesFull: it is in classic
[2:11:18] Tyfonius: they never said exactly how much they'll cost, just that they'd be about half he price
[2:11:23] VONDAVVE: for sure not underplayed atleast
[2:11:24] itsPerkii: Rogues and Warrior are the most played
[2:11:26] Sqwibbie: @macdaddigaming because we gotta think what happens when everyone gets exalted and no one is queing in a month
[2:11:30] Saibot102: @Zacrilioth is that already ingame?
[2:11:38] Pixiepantss: i bet its hunter
[2:11:38] Zolacee: yea warriors are tuned for 60 thats true
[2:11:40] cls33: i feel like its sham
[2:11:44] twisted_127: not p2
[2:11:46] malven: maybe hunt
[2:11:47] batchestspam: prob something like hunter with both faction access
[2:11:48] VONDAVVE: hunter prolly
[2:11:49] twisted_127: lol pally suck now
[2:11:53] twisted_127: well ret
[2:11:57] Saibot102: @Zacrilioth the mount cost thing
[2:11:59] NericoTV: gotta be rogue.... nothing but fucking rogues replying to lf healer for gnomer
[2:11:59] macdaddigaming: @Sqwibbie At that point we'll be leaning towards P3 where AB rep gets less value.
[2:12:00] skeemsquash: imagine playing alliance smh 😂
[2:12:02] phailix: we have almost no warlocks in my guild
[2:12:02] aspectoflion: hunter and mage I think is the most played
[2:12:06] Zacrilioth: @Saibot102 no
[2:12:09] Tyfonius: in EU it seems hunter is most popular
[2:12:10] GabeCesar: you remind me of jeff seid
[2:12:12] yoCoded: yo yo yo yo yo
[2:12:12] Nightbot: yo
[2:12:12] Gazza_8: Hairstyle back to the 90`s :)
[2:12:12] Sqwibbie: @macdaddigaming yeah so AB will be dead my point lol
[2:12:20] mexicchilli: nice style of tshirt man it looks really good
[2:12:21] GabeCesar: with the hair
[2:12:23] twisted_127: we did but there right with warrior on meter
[2:12:30] KaptainKen: lol thats not a bad thing though!
[2:12:34] yoCoded: nah don’t compare Sonii to Jeff seid plz
[2:12:34] Zolacee: maybe not even 60 but late game content
[2:12:35] Sqwibbie: @macdaddigaming but itll be important then for sure too and at 60 they add new items each phase
[2:12:37] waterfastingceo: Thats a compliment he is a chad
[2:12:38] TakeMeToValhalla: react andy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcvhhyOawBE&t=843s @SONII
[2:12:44] OGTigolebitties: I’m liking my warrior right now , you just need a pocket healer always and you’re a menace
[2:12:48] Indomitablez: Im at Org ready to kick your butt whenever you're ready. Ill be here for hours ganking
[2:12:50] macdaddigaming: @Sqwibbie Idk man, nothing we can control.
[2:12:57] Slaughter13x: JEFF SEID DOESNT LOVE WOW AND PC
[2:12:57] pyroblast70: why did the tourney get canned
[2:13:03] Sqwibbie: @macdaddigaming no were just explaining why we dont like the adjustments is all

[2:15:45] Slyz777: I personally think SoD is the best version of WoW atm
[2:15:46] twisted_127: esfad is hor on gtarp
[2:15:47] baboonya: Be really cool to see another Mak'gora dueling tournament!
[2:15:48] zollicious14: I heckin love sod
[2:15:52] iStrudderz: its meh.. nothing pulling me into want to lvl
[2:15:55] twisted_127: i miss his ret content
[2:16:00] Brokentrojanx: SoD is the best verison of wow i stg. i cannot even look at retail
[2:16:05] OceanlabTV: cause hes getting big bucks lol
[2:16:06] Tee__Gee_: its addicting pretty sure
[2:16:07] kyidentity: he has always streamed super long
[2:16:09] Cubanito06: i dont know why he does dead game
[2:16:10] itsPerkii: He's not Esfand anymore. He is Cornwood
[2:16:13] KaptainKen: Lol at this point he isnt RPing he IS cornwood
[2:16:20] Slyz777: some arena would be nice
[2:16:20] twisted_127: he rp a cop and makes more money than a cop
[2:16:21] itsPerkii: Wake was saying he talks to him of stream as if he is Cornwood
[2:16:28] baboonya: @SONII would you like to see another Mak'gora dueling tournament?
[2:16:34] Cubanito06: until we get fresh classic->wrath again im playing sod
[2:16:53] iStrudderz: ssf mak gora
[2:16:55] baboonya: hahaha
[2:17:14] Oodyny: @iStrudderz yes
[2:17:15] Scottylax: wait rip the tourney, didn't know it was cancelled
[2:17:41] Winttyrr: SSF makgora imo would be way cooler, wish the first one was SSF. the first tourney was so scuffed imo with all the group farming and AH shit
[2:17:44] Sqwibbie: nah i hate that idea
[2:17:50] realmalfurionsr: keep as is, and let guilds decide if they want 30 or 35 instead
[2:17:55] baboonya: @Winttyrr no doubt
[2:17:56] KaptainKen: Only thing that sucks with classic duel tourneys is its Snutz and whoever wants to come in second lol
[2:18:03] Supersikness: SOD isnt hard
[2:18:06] Brokentrojanx: 20 man is fine lol
[2:18:08] kyidentity: 20m seems good
[2:18:10] Supersikness: even for casuals
[2:18:15] Slovak_: fuck 40 man raids fuck the "has to be classic" mentality
[2:18:15] Tyfonius: i couldnt imagine finding 39 other people to raid with with how dead my realm is already
[2:18:19] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[2:18:21] AlphaSimply: xdd
[2:18:21] Winttyrr: fuck 40man raiding. that's my stance
[2:18:21] pinochetsama01: SoD isn't Vanilla
[2:18:25] twisted_127: roster boss is literally hardest boss in classic
[2:18:29] Saibot102: tbh i do think 20m is good idea having tuned most lower raids to 10m it would make sense that max level raids would be 20m
[2:18:39] talbybucketz: nobody is going to take 40 people to a raid they can clear with 20, SOD players are all sweaty
[2:18:42] jschroe3: Hey hot stuff
[2:18:46] The_Crane: @sonii you should lvl an enhance shaman. It's like a warrior on steroids that can blow everything up
[2:18:50] jschroe3: How's your night
[2:18:51] Tdoh__: I think SONII would have beat snutz 100% you were stomping warlocks all day

[2:19:31] The_Crane: Enhance is wild rifht now
[2:19:35] Sqwibbie: That XP bonus is sick
[2:19:36] skeemsquash: you beat snutz, ziqo beats you, and snutz beats ziqo. that’s just how it would have went . sorry to hurt anyone’s feelings
[2:19:37] Sqwibbie: I love that idea
[2:19:40] NericoTV: alt warrior when
[2:19:44] The_Crane: Even ele is dope right now
[2:19:44] Melorlol: enhance is fun af
[2:19:45] Naddah: enhance is super fun

[2:20:23] Cubanito06: Gross
[2:20:23] KaptainKen: Same actually
[2:20:29] skeemsquash: catta hype
[2:20:31] Saibot102: but youre probably like way beyond me so itll prolly be faster for you :)
[2:20:34] KaptainKen: everyone and their mom will be a rogue including me lol
[2:20:37] Winttyrr: cata pvp was fantastic, im gonna go fuckin hard on it
[2:20:39] Zolacee: MoP classic when
[2:20:42] Winttyrr: grind conquest points every week
[2:20:43] Slyz777: I'm tapping out of Cata
[2:20:46] The_Crane: Shamans are actually too good now. I'm scared they're gonna nerf them
[2:20:47] Pixiepantss: thats prob me
[2:20:49] Pixiepantss: lol
[2:20:49] Cubanito06: let me play the xpo that killed wow as we know and love
[2:20:52] Melorlol: i think everyone has a bad view of cata cause of dragonsoul and not the WHOLE xpac
[2:20:54] BrotherDanTV: When cata comes out, people jump on the train if there's nothing else to do
[2:20:58] rinohwow: cata pve DansGame
[2:21:00] reliminaj: what have you done to your head my guy
[2:21:02] OceanlabTV: Wrath was pretty bad though

[2:21:18] Saibot102: cata has what 4 raid tiers?
[2:21:21] Winttyrr: cata pve >>> wrath pve til DS
[2:21:25] VONDAVVE: wrath pvp sucks ass
[2:21:27] Cubanito06: the only problem with wrath is that SOD came out during the finale
[2:21:27] Winttyrr: firelands is amazing
[2:21:28] tannydanner: wrath was ruined by the wow token
[2:21:36] cls33: can the STV rep take you to exalted or just revered like the ashenvale event
[2:21:39] itsmistero: we dont
[2:21:41] KaptainKen: floating in dalaran will always be a safe place for me but yeah its boring lol
[2:21:41] kyidentity: wrath is bad because 10m + 25 mans = burnout
[2:21:54] NutMutt_: Me
[2:21:54] Slaughter13x: You streaming tomorrow @SONII
[2:21:55] TheBoysCT: Nothing else to do in wotlk at this point but wait.

[2:22:16] Kingconn223: wrath was destroyed by all the GDKPS and how everyone only cared about Gearscore
[2:22:22] Zolacee: wrath classic was fun for me cuz it was first time but from there on ive played all xpacs so...
[2:22:32] NutMutt_: More streams, please. Additional 15 minutes, per stream.... idunclEkek

[2:22:58] Saibot102: first covid now this unbelievable
[2:22:58] Cubanito06: Breaking news chinese gamers dont know waht fun is
