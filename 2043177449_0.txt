[0:04:08] n0s0upbr0: @scapeej sup fam how are you
[0:04:39] ScapeeJ: @n0s0upbr0 Im doing well, still banned in Dorki chat or waaaaaaaaat?
[0:04:48] kelly_mac06: makes the happy speeching at blizzcon feel very hollow tbh
[0:04:49] ScapeeJ: Xyro out to get u
[0:04:51] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[0:05:51] shakibdh: yo good morning lil bro
[0:06:00] ScapeeJ: @n0s0upbr0 Dam thats wild af lol
[0:06:09] Imfiredup: good morning from Cyrprus mate
[0:06:13] n0s0upbr0: nah I lowkey told him too
[0:06:31] n0s0upbr0: firedup man can u give me a race to world first unban man
[0:06:33] n0s0upbr0: fuck dude
[0:06:37] ScapeeJ: @n0s0upbr0 Your a wild yutedem
[0:06:42] itsmagyks: shakib/jb streams in legion were peak wow
[0:06:43] Imfiredup: i haven't thought of a deck for that guy yet
[0:06:56] n0s0upbr0: @scapeej this is like my third time watching this jdotb guy
[0:06:58] Imfiredup: yea, its only 16s against towers though
[0:07:16] Ceneera: Wait? Firedup is a huge warcraft rumble gamer?
[0:07:24] shakibdh: ya I dont have a deck for him yet
[0:07:47] n0s0upbr0: firedup gives me grandmaster league of legend vibes
[0:07:51] ScapeeJ: Firedup being awake this early is criminal
[0:08:25] Morphzero: did JB sleep in?
[0:08:27] Ceneera: @ScapeeJ it could be late?
[0:08:44] n0s0upbr0: does jdotb live in Europe or just play on EU
[0:08:49] ren0m: Just play
[0:09:16] n0s0upbr0: Well that’s good at least
[0:09:26] monntuu: good morning!!
[0:09:38] n0s0upbr0: the United States of America has a man with values in jdotb
[0:09:44] ren0m: We've not bought enough store mounts.
[0:09:52] ren0m: And now they're getting fired
[0:10:07] n0s0upbr0: ye the layoffs are all nonsense brother once mergers happen the company taking over typically kicks out senior leadership and replaces with their own leadership
[0:10:15] n0s0upbr0: i worked at a company that did that
[0:11:52] Morphzero: Might have something to do with CEO's being paid an absurd amount of $$
[0:13:22] Morphzero: can you LoS crushing Depths?
[0:13:26] n0s0upbr0: no
[0:13:43] Morphzero: shame
[0:13:44] n0s0upbr0: well maybe but it’s gonna recast
[0:13:54] n0s0upbr0: even if u meld or feign it it recasts

[0:27:54] bschs1: @jdotb question, do u think disc is good for puging high keys? i feel like sometiems people messed up and i cant fix too fast
[0:28:26] WytherOK: should I adjust my coworkers workstation by 1 inch just to see if he notices? desk height, all chair adjustments
[0:29:31] kelly_mac06: @Elvenbane you're tardy to the party friend
[0:29:40] bschs1: i'm kinda struggling to heal third boss TOTT as disc, idk what i'm doing wrong, i feel like my life would be much easier if i play resto or monk
[0:29:55] aimbim: as disc i sometimes feel like a passenger in the key. no kick. only 1 cc button that doesnt work often.
[0:30:08] JukeboxHey: Did you hear about the massive blizzard layoffs? 1900 peeps. F
[0:30:13] Elvenbane: @kelly_mac06 that's what I get for not scrolling up

[0:31:47] bschs1: yeah i never saw back to back dots
[0:32:31] Vitaraptor: Why is holy pri growin in popularity in m+ all of a sudden?  Surely disc is better for highest keys

[0:38:35] anaya909: they should just scrap d4 at this point
[0:38:57] zebracak35: d4 is printing money
[0:39:00] SeanTKE: 8% of 24000 people including the complete dismantling of their unannounced survival game team (many people moved to other teams)
[0:39:21] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:39:38] CyonDru: probs laying off ppl to bring over their own ppl or no
[0:39:40] kelly_mac06: yea i am just heartbroken for the ppl losing their jobs, no matter which game they worked on
[0:39:44] monntuu: yup
[0:39:51] monntuu: double markets
[0:39:54] kelly_mac06: i was laid off a few years ago and it took almost 9 months for me to get a job
[0:40:00] monntuu: take best of both teams
[0:40:04] kelly_mac06: so it's understandable but it really sucks
[0:40:18] kelly_mac06: @monntuu oh for sure! that's the only real choice
[0:40:44] Vitaraptor: Why is holy pri growin in popularity in m+ all of a sudden? Surely disc is better for highest keys
[0:41:18] ren0m: What did you do before streaming?
[0:41:29] somerandomwowguy: @Vitaraptor Have to try the new buffs
[0:41:32] Ninjian: I got laid off for a similar reason too. we got bought and merged. then the 2023 gov shutdown meant we lost 90% of our contracts. it sucked
[0:41:36] kelly_mac06: yep
[0:41:42] kelly_mac06: and its rough
[0:42:11] Vitaraptor: @somerandomwowguy  oh, i didn see buffs for it, fair enough
[0:42:52] sw0ngs: that's called being depressed, not being bummed out xD
[0:43:22] sw0ngs: classic 101 denial xD haha
[0:43:32] kelly_mac06: its not really depressed, its a different sort of bad like you question your own like ability and confidence
[0:43:39] Ninjian: @sw0ngs nah there is a difference between the two
[0:43:46] Grasshoppa117: teach me how to heal fyrak as disc lol im tryna get aotc or should i jst roll holy :p
[0:43:57] cbaprod: cbaprod subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 44 months! Sub Mr streamer Sir
[0:44:25] dithrica: husband was let go from his job after 13 years for refusing to do something illegal and it still messed with him mentally
[0:44:48] wow_its_tenbux: bro i cried my stupid eyes out through reading my vows, how embarassing
[0:44:49] kelly_mac06: @dithrica im really sorry but good on him for not caving and doing the illegal stuff. that's the worst feeling
[0:45:02] kelly_mac06: @wow_its_tenbux nah that's beautiful!
[0:45:30] jedimind_lbc: that's great to hear though.. im getting married in May.. beautiful thing man
[0:45:38] dithrica: @kelly_mac06 the plus side was he got a very nice severance (cause you know) and then a much better job offer literally the next day.
[0:45:52] kelly_mac06: @dithrica that is AWESOME!
[0:46:02] kelly_mac06: being a good person pays off @dithrica
[0:46:20] Grasshoppa117: didnt realised i logged on to dr phill haha
[0:46:20] dithrica: right!
[0:46:21] sw0ngs: yea that sounds like the emotions I had when my son was born. Was like, whats all the fuss about, why would you cry
[0:46:47] kelly_mac06: yea when it's you, it's overwhelming
[0:46:53] whiskeyhide: also hard not to feel like its your fault even when it clearly isnt
[0:47:05] zebracak35: see thats why i'm super ugly, so i dont have to get tricked like that
[0:47:22] treavorthenusance: when i had my first kid it was pure panic in the hospital, second kid i was chillin. brains are funny
[0:47:56] kelly_mac06: yea when i got laid off in late 2019, i got a really good severance and health insurance package, which ran out right when COVID hit and they did the bonus unemployment so the timing was great for me
[0:47:57] dithrica: empathy to that extent that it's not different when it's yourself would be unmanageable for anyone lol
[0:48:10] kelly_mac06: @dithrica oh god yes
[0:48:37] wow_its_tenbux: restaurant and retail managers don't give a good golly fuck about your schedule preferences
[0:50:24] ohlittlebrain: damn jb that was my first job too
[0:51:01] wow_its_tenbux: wow_its_tenbux subscribed with Prime. 
[0:51:06] Minigamer911: I got fired on Thanksgiving just after I bought a house. Scared me for awhile
[0:51:22] SupaCoopa2688: they were 100% going to ask you to finish your shift lol
[0:51:22] Ninjian: I got laid off on Labor Day LUL
[0:51:38] Sizebot: based
[0:51:42] JustTipu: budokai based
[0:51:51] whiskeyhide: @Ninjian OMEGALUL hope youre okay but damn thats funny
[0:52:40] Ninjian: i play wow, im never okay. but im getting by <3 i find humor in it now
[0:54:44] IAmRhys1: !song
[0:54:49] IAmRhys1: !song2
[0:58:41] ren0m: jdotbHypers
[0:58:50] treavorthenusance: the scream team
[0:59:00] CyonDru: sign me up kekw
[0:59:08] wow_its_tenbux: you only have 4 days to have your team formed
[0:59:39] ren0m: I can be a substitute healer if you get injured.
[0:59:55] WytherOK: sign me up coach
[1:00:30] somerandomwowguy: MW Cant get belor =) =) =) =) =)
[1:01:07] Torswan: I agree, i need my legendary.
[1:01:12] CyonDru: oh damn Mike Ybarra leaving blizzard
[1:01:16] BipolarPongal: Crests :)
[1:01:23] Greneer: yeah got suncaller week 7 of season doing tindrall every week. got it week 1 of playing resto shaman... feelsbadman
[1:01:31] Aetro_: i cant wait to never get the trinket that i spend 2-3 hours per week farming. YAY!
[1:01:40] Minigamer911: I still have a normal Signet
[1:01:51] whiskeyhide: i had to pay a resto druid 400k for ashes on my dh
[1:01:51] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:01:52] DuCkiii3: ive never seen the leaf or voodoo totem drop in a key in over 200 runs across all characters
[1:01:55] whiskeyhide: worth tho
[1:02:14] SeanTKE: paladin and monk cant even change loot spec on vault to get ranged dps trinkets
[1:02:39] ren0m: Will the season end soon?
[1:02:50] somerandomwowguy: Killing hc bosses over and over lets you redeem a piece or smth
[1:02:56] Aetro_: ^
[1:03:18] hipposlam: try having your entire class balanced around a legendary that you may never get. this far into the season and i still dont have it.
[1:03:22] Torswan: Whats your take on legendaries being completely random? Some folks get it on alts week 2, some get it week 12, some never.
[1:03:25] Garsto: i miss the loot system of wrath where you can collect currencies for targeted deterministic rewards
[1:03:44] Kemplore: What if trinkets were not drops but earned through tokens
[1:04:04] Sizebot: It already doesn't feel Legendary. It feels manufactured and empty.
[1:04:32] Garsto: yeah exactly right, a cap on currency rewards
[1:04:32] mxdvoid: so based
[1:04:35] Vitaraptor: Im still farmin the fall staff, never win it even if it drops.  S1 i farmed ragefeather all season nd never got it.  Should defo be some vendor option later in the season
[1:04:35] Garsto: would be balanced
[1:04:38] Torswan: @Sizebot my friend got it on 2nd kill. isn't even going to create it because its too expensive lol
[1:04:44] Minigamer911: The drop rate for it is almost 20% at this point, if drop stats can be trusted
[1:04:44] SeanTKE: I don't understand why the pvp system gets deterministic loot and pve system doesn't
[1:04:49] whiskeyhide: like nov 13th maybe
[1:05:27] Cruzerthebruzer: ONE BILLION PERCENT
[1:05:31] Corkscrews: havent gotten a single weapon from vault on my main, feels bad
[1:05:32] Cruzerthebruzer: Same with m+ 489s
[1:05:33] melkboer_: @SeanTKE because you need need pvp gear in every slot or you've got nothing to do there lol
[1:05:40] todiie: like s4 of shadowlands?
[1:05:46] ren0m: What if raids dropped tokens you can use to buy gear?
[1:05:51] kelly_mac06: you mean like DINARS
[1:05:53] Cruzerthebruzer: Dinar was such a good fucking system
[1:05:53] kelly_mac06: lol
[1:05:59] kelly_mac06: i loved them so much
[1:05:59] Tfos: they should also start allowing healers to loot for dps trinket like the one from tindral
[1:05:59] Cruzerthebruzer: But they hate happiness
[1:06:03] kelly_mac06: god i hope they bring it back
[1:06:03] frazlord: Hopefully MSFT didn't lay off the guy working on permanent dinars
[1:06:05] pumpkinbeats: not everyone gets to win :)
[1:06:10] kelly_mac06: nah you got normal
[1:06:15] kelly_mac06: and then you could upgrade it
[1:06:19] sw0ngs: well everyone complained about tierset, so im sure they can make a curio or something for trinkets/weapons
[1:06:26] kelly_mac06: but you had to raid the appropriate level to get the currency to upgrade
[1:06:48] pumpkinbeats: i like that some ppl wont ever get an item, increases its value
[1:07:19] wow_its_tenbux: the problem is more of tying so much performance to a single item
[1:07:28] DevotiionR: i dident get rashoks last season till 3 week until season ends
[1:07:46] Tfos: worst feeling is playing MW wanting tindral trinket and not having chance to loot for it so without guild im screwed
[1:08:02] Cruzerthebruzer: WoW is honestly just not a competitive game, and it sucks if you wanna play it like one.
[1:08:09] anaya909: yeah rashok's last season was the difference for hpal forgetting mana exists
[1:08:42] Tfos: no i dont have guild i dont have even a chance to loot it
[1:08:54] big___jim: mws can loot both fyrrak trinkets on their own instead, which is kinda big
[1:09:12] Bierinfusion: Bierinfusion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 64 months! emergency meta shift?
[1:09:14] cbaprod: Got it in first vault x)
[1:09:22] Torswan: me and my friends just use alts and roll for each other. its scummy but whatever, thats the system.
[1:09:24] kelly_mac06: @cbaprod insta ban
[1:09:26] Tfos: how much would you pay for heroic?
[1:09:35] healapotamus: you could actually do that though
[1:09:46] cbaprod: @kelly_mac06 I played Boomie back then, didnt want it. Didnt get Pip until Mythic kill vault <.<
[1:10:10] Shkafche: would u then open vault as boomie/guardian ?
[1:10:19] WytherOK: make your own pug for heroic
[1:10:24] cbaprod: @jdotb let's just organize premade raid with skip and just funnel it?
[1:10:26] kelly_mac06: @cbaprod i still have 0 pips! never in vault, never looted it the couple of times it dropped. BUT i can't really complain bc i have 3 of my BIS trinkys
[1:10:32] WytherOK: ^
[1:10:41] Jemba: cant you assemble a twitch chat 30 man raid and be given the trinket
[1:10:59] cbaprod: @kelly_mac06 I have almost every trinket in this tier that I'm interested in but never any time to play:):):)
[1:11:18] cbaprod: Well let me do weekly organize it for you and you just keep the LFG window open for stream lol
[1:11:20] Tfos: other bad part is that i absolutely hate raid healing as MW LUL
[1:11:21] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[1:11:26] frazlord: Dorki has done a heroic for the Fyrrak tank trinket nearly every week and it hasn't dropped
[1:11:27] pumpkinbeats: we did plate only raid w/ skip to not even see the leggo drop :(
[1:11:32] WytherOK: how about when 2 drop and you roll low? OMEGALUL
[1:12:10] WytherOK: I haven't opened wow in months and I don't miss loot
[1:12:16] Cruzerthebruzer: Belorelos Pog
[1:12:19] explic_cit: why don’t you do viewerraids like other big streamers?
[1:12:28] Jemba: NOTED
[1:12:46] Cruzerthebruzer: It's cause it IS exploitative
[1:12:55] ThePantsParty01: exploit me baby
[1:12:56] Jemba: do you feel worse not having the trinket tho
[1:12:56] pumpkinbeats: what was that mrt wa you used
[1:12:57] sw0ngs: you'll grow numb to the feeling, you won't feel bad at all
[1:13:00] WytherOK: what if we all brought turbo rat characters and you were carrying us? :)
[1:13:01] somerandomwowguy: Well, its how wow is made
[1:13:05] melkboer_: can't exploit humans when they concent ;)
[1:13:13] melkboer_: consent
[1:13:19] simplepathjg: i feel so exploited
[1:13:21] Cruzerthebruzer: Consentful exploitative
[1:13:24] somerandomwowguy: If you want to play the content you enjoy to the fullest you have to get the stuff you want
[1:13:31] Cruzerthebruzer: They're probably not doing it anyways
[1:13:41] spoon_rl: Maybe if you do a viewer raid ill actually get the leggo
[1:13:43] cbaprod: Do you really think I pay T3 sub and gift subs to these viewers for you to NOT USE THAT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE? Kinda scummy of you Mr Streamer Kappa

[1:14:34] Shkafche: so after this key a viewer raid ?
[1:14:51] cbaprod: So how about a FRIEND raid with just your friends in chat LUL
[1:14:57] somerandomwowguy: Think most viewers would like to partake in the raid and more so if you get the trinket and can do m+ with it
[1:15:01] JustTipu: be more shameless like robin

[1:19:30] Jemba: oribos tho
[1:19:36] dblinkerson: they saw the lap runners and had to keep it goin
[1:19:36] Jemba: good track
[1:19:37] WytherOK: I hate bfa capital
[1:19:47] BipolarPongal: Dalaran circles too
[1:19:51] DevotiionR: why do you play the convoke build over the tree build?
[1:19:55] pumpkinbeats: chasing dragons
[1:19:57] whiskeyhide: WOD was worst, ashran or garrison
[1:20:04] Yatzeesauce: Dalaran is a full blown nascar track
[1:20:19] DevotiionR: so you use covoke for dmg?
[1:20:31] Sokchoy: WoD was the best because you didnt have to afk anywhere
[1:20:40] DevotiionR: cat form?
[1:20:51] neriumttv: thoughts on spriest?

[1:21:19] PSACaspah: have u tried holy priest at all since the buffs?
[1:21:26] BipolarPongal: DPS players with instant cc that won't press it during incorp is tilting af Madge
[1:21:26] LCSpartan: LCSpartan subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:22:20] DevotiionR: drs might be a issue? 2x pain sup and dome?
[1:22:32] LCSpartan: trying to learn resto druid coming from Hpriest and this has been super useful
[1:22:39] robied: rumors say that merres was playing boomie on turnament realm
[1:23:14] robied: gonna be interesting to se comps in mdi
[1:23:26] LCSpartan: @robied doesnt suprise me boomies consistent cleave is wild
[1:23:28] Bierinfusion: if you take all the painsups the discs need for himself, where druid just bearforms
[1:23:37] Sokchoy: shadow is good now disc is not meta
[1:23:45] dblinkerson: big prio dam from spriest is nice and juicy
[1:23:55] Sokchoy: disc believers are coping
[1:24:35] treavorthenusance: vdh, fmage, spriest, ret, rdruid will be a comp i see
[1:24:48] robied: @lcspartan but they need longer to ramp?
[1:25:26] LCSpartan: @robied they do but once a pull starts to hit like 30-45 seconds  that consistent cleave gets stupid
[1:25:54] robied: but u think it will be a god comp like last season?
[1:25:55] Cruzerthebruzer: there's so many permutations
[1:26:23] LCSpartan: and not all classes in some circumstances fit all dungeons
[1:26:31] treavorthenusance: since mdi is 20s ench shammy might cook
[1:26:52] bartfux: whats proving grounds?
[1:26:59] robied: @lcspartan that was what i was thinkin. they probably gonna change the comp from key to key
[1:27:51] Bret36: Think we'll see no healer, aug+3 dps?
[1:27:53] LCSpartan: I think the big one for difference is going to be Rise because thats very much a lot of ST damage comparitively
[1:30:02] RemwayTV: you finding starfire better for aoe?
[1:30:23] SupaCoopa2688: that phone WA is so triggering lol

[1:30:50] treavorthenusance: i just realized the phone rings are wa's. it always thought it was just part of the songs
[1:30:52] SupaCoopa2688: i figured as much lol
[1:30:59] treavorthenusance: im braindead
[1:31:13] markoleptic_: jb always on the phone in keys
[1:31:48] Jemba: i think ellesmere has that sound every time there's a debuff to dispell
[1:32:46] bigviewer3: hey JB do you like auggies?  or would you delete them
[1:33:18] markoleptic_: do you think of an incorp every time you call someone irl
[1:34:16] emereldz: stairs causing LoS is my one gripe with healing anywhere near stairs

[1:34:48] LCSpartan: @emereldz These specific stairs are terrible for no reason
[1:35:16] treavorthenusance: @emereldz i cant see you, your slightly elevated. it sounds like a monty python sketch
[1:35:20] emereldz: @LCSpartan All stairs are terrible for existing in this game
[1:35:55] LCSpartan: @emereldz Genuinely thats what drives me nuts especially with like Nelf being a taller class HOW CAN I NOT SEE
[1:36:21] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:36:26] emereldz: Like gnomes drowning when other classes can just walk through water and live
[1:39:51] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:41:52] LCSpartan: The worst is if you ever zoom into first person you are like my charecter can clearly see atleast part of yours but nooo
[1:44:03] emereldz: Blizzard wants immersion until it comes to stairs then all logic flies right out the window
[1:45:32] dithrica: @cbaprod ty for sub
[1:46:14] Shkafche: LOS with stairs is fine (recall in tazavesh there was a nice placce u could avoid the orbs that one add was usuing if u stand behind a small wall) but problem is ur party forgets about LoS  :D  luckily zandalari is the tallest one so rarelly and issue but is annoying for sure .. not as much as tree tops thou
[1:47:05] emereldz: @Shkafche tree tops in CoS... Whoever put trees in that dungeon needs to lose their job
[1:48:05] Shkafche: uuugh i wiped that from memory .. its EB i got a gripe with now
[1:48:21] dithrica: what, you don't enjoy leaf pov
[1:48:33] LCSpartan: EB can screw off..I ran that so much for the trinket
[1:48:55] LCSpartan: and those casters at the end with pugs make me wanna pull my hair out
[1:48:58] emereldz: Tree POV is as bad as the camera just slamming into your toons rear or the invisible wall becoming the cameras location
[1:49:08] Shkafche: i love tree POV, esp when i throw a vortes or efflo and my team gotta run up the branches of a tree or pillar to get to it
[1:49:25] ChestHairNibbler: ChestHairNibbler watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! df is this
[1:49:40] emereldz: RoP'ing Chandelliers is my favourite past time
[1:49:55] LCSpartan: @emereldz gotta keep those lights away
[1:49:59] treavorthenusance: EB aboms and mages are a special level of hell trash. like hey triple tick of cinderbolt one shot why not
[1:50:16] LCSpartan: those on bolstering, id rather just not play
[1:50:44] LCSpartan: also wtf do the flowers which are normal mobs cause on death affixes?
[1:50:58] minimcricket: is there a phone ringing sound bit coming from stream or am i trippin
[1:51:08] Shkafche: i dont mind the old dungeons (as havent played as current) but the spell queues need to be rechecked for sure
[1:51:10] emereldz: @minimcricket Weak aura for jb
[1:51:20] Shkafche: @minimcricket stream, if i gotta guess is the affix
[1:51:30] minimcricket: okay that's what i thought, haha- i kept looking around every minute or so

[2:05:20] Chevyiis: well we did safe route
[2:05:23] Silentfeety: When casting grove pets should I target someone or just pop it?
[2:05:40] MightyGIGACHAD: in caster packs that target dps, do you keep LB on a squishy dps or not really since if a cast goes through they’re dead anyways? @jdotb
[2:05:43] skelthu: how was that sp? is going to be meta now? looking good
[2:05:43] whiskeyhide: last boss dies relatively quick at least

[2:07:58] pumpkinbeats: for coming getting into druid heals whats a good way to tackle the shapeshifts
[2:07:59] xxpoperx: i mean its better than pipXrageheart right ?
[2:08:01] Clayoo_: Have you tried just looting it?
[2:08:02] Guffels: didnt we also decide you wouldnt run both heart and sun since they are both dps trinkets?
[2:08:04] xxpoperx: to have suncaller with rageheart
[2:08:04] pumpkinbeats: do u have seperate binds?
[2:08:06] sw0ngs: i guess he missed the 30 min rant on loot drops xD
[2:08:07] CyonDru: i almost died from usnig it kekw

[2:08:55] Silentfeety: I am afraid to play dps trinkets in my m+. What healers trinkets you think are the best to combo?
[2:09:07] Cruzerthebruzer: does resto druid run valkarah or whatever too?
[2:09:09] CyonDru: i just use it in weekly keys, i do not care to use it in higher keys. so i just stick to vessel and rageheart
[2:09:10] Cruzerthebruzer: the fyrakk weapon
[2:09:13] LCSpartan: I genuinely hate sight to sight wireless antennas...Id rather die
[2:09:15] RemwayTV: I have seen evokers kill themselves with suncallers on so many bosses right as like sbolt on brh boss goes out etc
[2:09:21] pichuux: gg
[2:09:28] dragona92: ⏸️
[2:09:36] ren0m: Why is it important to have lifebloom on yourself and a dps rather than a tank?
[2:09:46] bartfux: @ren0m because of the talent
[2:10:00] ren0m: Why dps on a tank
[2:10:03] dithrica: mfw I ran up to maiden on a 27 rise to belor and forgot about the orb coming back in 🙃
[2:10:06] ren0m: Rather*
[2:10:19] ren0m: Ah
[2:10:29] Silentfeety: What 2 healers trinket combo is best for m+?
[2:11:08] ren0m: I tried not giving it to a tank, thinking you have to send it on a dps. But I had no idea why that's the "rule".
[2:11:13] MightyGIGACHAD: do you have any videos of how to heal/live EB last boss?
[2:11:16] ren0m: @bartfux for self i know
[2:11:21] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[2:11:39] CyonDru: where did you guys end up on fyrakk last?
[2:11:45] simplepathjg: lfg 30s?
[2:12:48] Cruzerthebruzer: Revival is also absolutely bonkers on that fight
[2:12:50] simplepathjg: they kinda slam p1 no? just oom by intermission KEKW
[2:13:10] Rypick: another mass dispell gone
[2:13:51] somerandomwowguy: Revival isnt that bonkers though
[2:14:08] somerandomwowguy: A lot of mws have it assigned where it doesnt dispel
[2:14:27] bartfux: if they are doing tha tinto mythic fyrakk, you should kick them
[2:14:32] bartfux: lol
[2:14:56] somerandomwowguy: I mean, RWF used it directly into intermission
[2:14:58] simplepathjg: wait that sounds troll
[2:15:14] somerandomwowguy: So RWF didnt use it for dispel in p1
[2:16:03] somerandomwowguy: Dropping off is mythic only
[2:16:06] somerandomwowguy: You were on hc tab
[2:17:12] somerandomwowguy: Think its the one you are on
[2:18:03] somerandomwowguy: Both MW and Disc bring more dispels but their playstyle makes the raid be behind on them
[2:18:16] somerandomwowguy: Dispelling late becuase of ramp etc

[2:19:14] somerandomwowguy: Good choice, it hurts but its correct ^^
[2:20:29] Tombah: let them cook
[2:20:58] Tombah: sp?
[2:21:05] Rypick: When does MDI go live to watch
[2:21:31] flem_wow: havoc. chaos brand
[2:21:35] Cruzerthebruzer: could be DH
[2:21:38] treavorthenusance: double pi on a fire mage is probably based for fall
[2:21:46] Sokchoy: its not two priests stop
[2:21:53] bartfux: all priest, all PI, all day. can't die if the enemy dies first.
[2:22:29] Tombah: give pi no cd and party wide : smile :
[2:23:00] Cruzerthebruzer: Surely it's VDH in like every key right
[2:23:17] cbaprod: Guardian in those keys where survival isnt the main thing. Ironfur will do big dam
[2:23:30] kenpachiJoe: i think bear is good cause during its cd its unkillable or that was before not its not?
[2:24:39] treavorthenusance: yea bear struggles with mob control but maybe they've worked out something
[2:25:01] kenpachiJoe: also dont get surprised by CRUSADE ret pala. it does a lot of dmg even if its 2 min cd
[2:25:19] Cruzerthebruzer: it's hard to work something out when VDH has double sigils of chain and double silence sigil
[2:25:26] Cruzerthebruzer: 5% magic and they do good dam too shrug
[2:25:31] Tombah: @Cruzerthebruzer trueee
[2:25:43] treavorthenusance: moonfire bear does really good damage though
[2:26:18] Sokchoy: we need to stop this retrospective mplus comp justification
[2:26:25] Rypick: they have like 4 or 5 locks
[2:26:47] treavorthenusance: waycrest or similar dungeons with tight areas may be where bear shines
[2:27:18] Tombah: more control from the vdh ultimately means more damage because less used globals on trash cc and condensed trash (where it could b a problem)
[2:27:23] ogami91: probably no 10.2.6 news after these news mike ybarra quits
[2:27:59] WoozlesTV: @jdotb I think vengeance has great dmg and easy great defensives on very short cd, with extremely good cc.
[2:28:12] treavorthenusance: Microsoft aquires blizz, fans get excited. Microsoft lays off 1900 employess pepeSadJam
[2:28:51] Guffels: it was only 8%. thats standard for the industry right now
[2:28:59] Arkrisen: They canceled a project too. Their survival game.
[2:29:23] frazlord: When acquisitions like that happen, there is so much duplication in roles and responsibilities that it's necessary to layoff
[2:30:03] sw0ngs: @treavorthenusance was mostly microsoft employees right? or did I hear wrong
[2:30:22] treavorthenusance: i hate that they ever allowed mergers. seems very anti to the ideals of capitalistic markets
[2:30:24] Guffels: doesnt account for the over hiring that happened during covid either. this has been course correction across the whole gaming industry
[2:30:24] whiskeyhide: its like HR/finance a lot i think usually
[2:30:36] treavorthenusance: @sw0ngs report says its unknown now
[2:31:08] sw0ngs: ah ok
[2:31:17] Squizzed: could also just be an IP think as well
[2:31:18] treavorthenusance: allows for easier monopoly though. so now we have 5 dudes worth like 40% of our gdp
[2:31:46] Sokchoy: ye ye wonderful capitalism when is raid
[2:32:01] YayFiber: They are going to report record profits next week at earnings, easily.
[2:32:17] ren0m: Does Flourish increase the heal rate of only already active HoTs or does it also apply to any spells that are cast after Flourish?
[2:32:32] somerandomwowguy: Still cant grasp that a mount in wow made blizz more money than sc2 wings of liberty did
[2:33:14] ren0m: The extended duration, on the other hand, might only apply to active hots
[2:33:21] ren0m: I might want to try it out
[2:33:22] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:33:43] treavorthenusance: @somerandomwowguy disney makes 80% of thier money from 20% of the park visitors. so they raise prices to keep out the low spenders
[2:33:57] treavorthenusance: whales are very real in every industry
[2:35:20] Guffels: @YayFiber just because a company makes money doesnt mean they cant do layoffs. the people are irrelevant to the goal of the corporation
[2:35:39] YayFiber: @Guffels Things can be true and morally wrong.
[2:35:45] Guffels: absolutly
[2:35:56] brett1337: Kappa
[2:36:10] treavorthenusance: i mean south korea built most of their country on a monopoly tbh
[2:36:12] matijon: ye, meta can be good short time but at a long run it fucks up the game
[2:36:17] Guffels: companies dont have morals though, people do

[2:37:21] dithrica: @treavorthenusance hah was just about to make that example
[2:37:22] matijon: so monopoly is like a guy thats too handsome? its ait until he starts doing ur wife?
[2:37:28] Tombah: @dithrica isp monopolies are craaaaaazy
[2:37:31] treavorthenusance: your city infact caused isps to lobby more regs to raise the barrier
[2:37:36] Tombah: legit fucking awful
[2:37:56] dithrica: paying $40 more a month for internet vs across the street because local utility isp has rights there but not where I'm at

[2:38:59] treavorthenusance: @Sokchoy LUL
[2:39:01] Tombah: where im at, a 600k+ city, the monopoly is so bad that the ISP that runs the city is going BACKWARDS in time and implemented data caps on their speeds (they offer up to 4gbps).
[2:39:25] Tombah: and what choice do you have? you can't switch because there is no competition.
[2:39:36] dithrica: lol I was just thinking you sound like my husband when he gets going; econ/finance UG and law school
[2:39:46] treavorthenusance: plus jdot never smoked crack, freebase but smoke nah
[2:39:52] LuumaPlays: What about military ball attendees?

[3:09:59] ShineTheLeo: Is there any fight on mythic where holy would feel stronger than disc?
[3:10:38] FrostmagicED: @ShineTheLeo I would argue igira
[3:10:56] FrostmagicED: but; every fight, if you time every aspect of dpriest healing to the rest of ur raid
[3:11:03] FrostmagicED: will be mw/disc on top
[3:11:37] FrostmagicED: kariDONOWALL
[3:12:26] FrostmagicED: rooLove u dad
[3:13:06] ShineTheLeo: @FrostmagicED I just play wiht a parselord rshaman, and a parselord rdruid as a disc priest. So I get sniped on everything
[3:13:30] FrostmagicED: @FrostmagicED correct; play holy and snipe them back
[3:13:36] FrostmagicED: then when they complain
[3:13:41] FrostmagicED: say "healer parses aren't real"
[3:13:42] ShineTheLeo: They can see my ramp windows in our notes and just squash em, I struggle to outplay em
[3:13:52] FrostmagicED: alternatively
[3:13:56] FrostmagicED: ramp 2 seconds earlier than your note
[3:13:58] FrostmagicED: and they can't stop you
[3:14:01] FrostmagicED: won't be as effective
[3:14:03] FrostmagicED: but
[3:14:06] FrostmagicED: they can't predict that
[3:14:12] ShineTheLeo: I suppose so
[3:14:25] ShineTheLeo: Didn't think to do that
[3:14:30] FrostmagicED: If your healer core is fighting itself b/c "muh parses"
[3:14:34] FrostmagicED: you're dooming urself to fail
[3:14:37] FrostmagicED: chase parses in farm
[3:14:40] FrostmagicED: and 2-3 heal
[3:14:49] FrostmagicED: b/c healer parses aren't real

[3:28:15] FrostmagicED: the roots add a tON of time
[3:28:21] FrostmagicED: you never get stunned
[3:28:30] Sokchoy: ye that’s real but it also doesn’t really matter. whats bigger issue is you pop trinket too early
[3:28:40] FrostmagicED: nah your using
[3:28:49] FrostmagicED: trinket
[3:28:50] FrostmagicED: while taking
[3:28:56] FrostmagicED: A TON of ticks
[3:29:08] CyonDru: insane amount of sun callers to drop this kill
[3:29:27] Sokchoy: you need to pop it right as you’re casting mindblast or penance not on the evang or pet global
