[4:20:00] Renfuryy: after this run we'll have to wait like 25 minutes to go again if it doesnt drop
[4:20:25] Vitticus: coachella not considered rave because they play mainstream music and it isn't all night. raves generally go on until sunrise.
[4:20:29] HoneycombTV: I'm not going to any event that relies on porta potties :)

[6:45:26] Elijahss: this one does not have move speed
[6:45:31] Elijahss: oh
[6:45:33] gamelifedotcom: No movement buffs don't combine with mounts.  Mounts are debuffed awhile ago to be their own speed.
