[3:00:34] QuinHelmisch: @bistraya_seledka
[3:02:17] bistraya_seledka: @QuinHelmisch, WoW has much different community. Ninja looters, work-like guilds, cross-faction hatred, mob-stealing, etc. It's natural that cheaters could appear there. Chess is more of high-class game, which is supposed to behave differently.

[4:35:05] frosty78: can you sell thing on the ah, and not buy, or is it no on both?
[4:35:05] FdMrr: even on max level?
[4:35:20] avenomxx: just dont level north of red ridge , too dangerous
[4:35:35] bistraya_seledka: Grinding Twilight Hammer for a book quest in Darkshore should be fine if it's one on one battles.
[4:35:43] OGSceneBoy: Can you enchant gear?
[4:35:56] bistraya_seledka: And I think there's a way to do Grimclaw quest stealthly without attracting enemies.
[4:35:57] xmedpakx: xmedpakx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! this is entertaining, gl swifty

[4:36:31] FdMrr: LOL 21
[4:36:35] OGSceneBoy: You got this xD
[4:36:35] stormwindchill: @aviduser2 it's not silly.  it's supposed to be hardcore
[4:36:38] QuinHelmisch: No, its perfect
[4:36:48] ImShmoly: @aviduser2 some people would make bank on the AH and buy full gear
[4:37:00] bistraya_seledka: @stormwindchill, hardcore is playing with PvP flag on.
[4:37:24] Herzenliegen: If you could buy everything on the AH it wouldn't be hardcore.
[4:37:31] xxf3v3rxx: hardcore is like pokemon nuzzlocks
[4:37:36] xmedpakx: blue items from dungeons quests will be quitenice
[4:37:39] aviduser2: but people are allowed to use the boon and save world buffs? How is that hardcore??
[4:37:45] Vekilius: You sell Gray at 100k gold someone will buy it
[4:37:46] bistraya_seledka: @Swifty, better retreat. Dragons are too dangerous.
[4:37:59] OGSceneBoy: Yeah getting some nice blues makes life hella easier

[4:39:20] OGSceneBoy: I skipped redridge lol
[4:39:48] glindes: retail is better
[4:39:54] bistraya_seledka: Hardcore should not be difficult at all. Grinding green mobs to level 60 should be safe enough. The problem is that it's boring.\
[4:39:59] xmedpakx: trolling most likely
[4:40:01] jargly: healer perspective i just dont like the momentum that arena games have come to
