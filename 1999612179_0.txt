[4:36:22] maldivskiy: lock using pots/scroll first , pally was second. pally was dcqd, but lock its fine, wtf?
[4:36:26] praxtv: in retail, if you equip a wand (now it's a weapon though) you can use it with right click as any other weapon
[4:36:46] PugGrenade: The Pally was warned after the first round and continued to use things that GMs advised not to.
[4:36:50] vedro_konya: @warcraft why sonydigital can use bafs and pots, but holysaxy cant use it?
[4:36:52] DartG: @maldivskiy you can get pots and scrolls, but you can't get outside help
[4:36:54] Ristvakbaen1911: @maldivskiy Scrolls/pots are alright if you could get them in Elwynn I believe
[4:37:04] Paleek: @Warcraft Unlock Living Flame EU 󠀀
[4:37:17] silex1690: How did the pally get help if it was a closed server?

[4:39:29] WShadows: oh if its "ONLY" 10 minutes of this...
[4:39:30] genpresu: 💀
[4:39:37] Night_Core: "Players will beable to use all items & consumables at their disposal during the duels." Thats your rules, @Warcraft
[4:39:40] deBymen: a 10 min timer on the screen would be neat
[4:39:45] silex1690: I think a guy got timed out earlier for suggesting that level 60s helped lol… Sounds like things are confusing
[4:39:59] maldivskiy: holysax won this guys, unsportable kick
[4:39:59] PugGrenade: It's meant to be a competition of low levels with only buffs from other of level humans from the Race to Hogger 1st activity

[4:43:15] 7thSaga: LUL
[4:43:22] Grashuck: manareg at low level is way to high for these duels to be fun. without interrupt paladin can heal way more than mage can damage
[4:43:27] Anhard: @craboskai idk about all of them, but soni got personal healer for sure

[4:44:16] Surozh: This is a hypocritical tournament
[4:44:16] Ristvakbaen1911: @DeportedToHell What's the difference between a 60 making the wand or himself making it?
[4:44:36] hypnoidal: why pala doesn’t LOS?

[4:47:06] briannahbunny: Using more than 1 health potion in this type of event seems like it kind of detracts from the duels imo
[4:47:06] Sakkinee: both drops
[4:47:07] ckom36: why did not they make a dedicated server for this tournament as it was mentioned in the rules? many issues could have been avoided.
[4:47:11] Sarynrae: its been 2 mins lol
[4:47:15] Ristvakbaen1911: @DeportedToHell That still doesn't answer my question. What is the difference in the wand itself if it's made by a 60 or him?
[4:47:16] Flappybirdqt: if hozito cast more would have been over.

[4:54:06] Ristvakbaen1911: @the_bearrr I don't believe it was pots. It was buffs like MotW, no?
[4:54:15] TheTripOut: KEEP LIVING FLAME EU CLOSED
[4:54:16] ArchspireWoW: Do they have a timer to know if its 10 min tho? I forget if the timer is in classic
[4:54:19] juceekiller: how do you kill that which has no life?
[4:54:21] chadillac91: @the_bearrr and claiming its for fun and not to be upset

[4:56:22] sebbeke: what item?
[4:56:31] craboskai: what items? LUL he was lvl 10
[4:56:32] dergNwolf: @Slesky literally plenty of mages around, plus there (were) 2 priests in the competition
[4:56:32] Dintory: why not bring back fatheros too? or did holy not have the buffs then?
[4:56:33] ExtraLexical: Forbidden items?
[4:56:35] Yeorgaki: What items?
[4:56:37] obstata: what item? u cant keep that secret
[4:56:40] the_bearrr: everyone used outside help items, but when small guy does it suddenly hes not allowed
[4:56:43] FartGobb1er: say item
[4:56:46] Bruchteil: so it is getting serious ofc ofc
[4:56:52] Bootch: there is like 20 sonies, there is sonidigital, sonii, sony now who is this one I cant follow LUL but good luck to both contestants! <3
[4:57:05] AshBeyondGaming: while I was on the PTR (Hardcore) I saw some higher lvl chars around - maybe he was using items that were obtained through such means
[4:57:10] diablohunter_5: how did he cheated ??
[4:57:14] Yeorgaki: name the items used!
[4:57:19] elvenrosevt: i heard some people saved marbles for makgora lol
[4:57:22] Ristvakbaen1911: @the_bearrr tbf if he also got a warning about it and continued to use them..
[4:57:28] vitaminabcdefgh: @Bootch didnt sonii rename from sonydigital?

[4:57:37] LordMuTLY: that was well played!!!
[4:57:38] craboskai: @AshBeyondGaming then every streamer warlock/mage would be dqd since they got wands from viewers
[4:57:41] kaashee: all buffs for the win
[4:57:47] DeportedToHell: twice dead xdd
[4:57:52] Jiviex: Sony best mage confirmed.
[4:57:52] Grashuck: they should dq anyone with buffs not from their own class
[4:57:57] Bootch: vitaminabcdefgh so so sonidigital is sonii nice, ah yes this is SONII nice, hes a god
[4:58:29] AshBeyondGaming: @AshBeyondGaming it's just a guess :) I was just there to record before I went over to prepare for the BFD race
[4:58:33] LordMuTLY: please...
[4:58:36] Ristvakbaen1911: @craboskai I don't think the wands really are that big of an issue still if they're using ones that could be obtained at that time via crafting
[4:58:38] the_bearrr: @ristvakbaen1911 why he got warning because of it tho, he go help from other people to get pots, but every streamer gets infinite gold and resources its fine no warning nothing
[4:58:41] orcrimmar: what does infestors get for killing ziqo?
[4:58:46] Anhard: troll posion, nice to see it

[5:00:26] Ristvakbaen1911: @craboskai I don't disagree with the outside help. But I think there's a big difference between something (usually) obtainable vs something you can't obtain until way later
