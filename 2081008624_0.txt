[2:15:08] fortchx: from a streaming pov retail has a bigger audience too right
[2:15:11] bobfross_gaming: no shot retail can ever be balance and good
[2:15:13] guilty1998: How Long will wotlk go?
[2:15:16] tunelmachine: no cata private servers ever strived idk
[2:15:25] BOBHYPE: Did you catch the final Liquid vs. Echo game yesterday in AWC?
[2:15:38] daltine: 2's might be rlly bad in cata
[2:15:44] shucoco: Cata is way too hard for the targeted demographic of wotlk. Pve gets harder in cata and pve not being as free as in tbc was a big reason for the player base drop
[2:15:49] tunelmachine: isn't that the problem of being super high MMR?
[2:15:52] demongodxtv: it will be exactly the same as cata hype at the start and it will die off when people get bored @Minpojke
[2:16:01] shucoco: So possibly cata will have way less playwrs than wrath
[2:16:11] fortchx: wotlk seemed quite diverse in s5 with so many teams playing at a high level
[2:16:13] unimonosolo: if blizz has any desire to make cata succeed they will change a lot of systems to make it easier to jump in and play
[2:16:16] fortchx: now its next to none
[2:16:26] bamboonas: Cata is probably going to have more pvpers but less pvers
[2:16:40] freezytvx: what am i readig
[2:16:41] Flodimo: cata classic is a giant cope
[2:16:53] freezytvx: are u meds my guy @bamboonas

[2:17:02] bamboonas: @freezytvx ?
[2:17:14] freezytvx: what more pvpers
[2:17:18] freezytvx: can u explain
[2:17:28] var: when is cata coming
[2:17:35] bamboonas: Not really heard any pvp streamer complain about cata pvp
[2:17:57] shucoco: @bamboonas thanks god man, its not even out
[2:18:03] meldo_p: every  classic will have more pvpers that Wotlk KEKW
[2:18:09] freezytvx: u can't imagine what dead shit will be cata
[2:18:21] bamboonas: I can imagine pve is going to be dead but not pvp
[2:18:30] freezytvx: in cata u will have retail players + torsten 20 coach teams thats what u gna have in cata
[2:18:37] shucoco: Pve dead means dead game
[2:18:59] cepsegnever: don't worry guys mop comes after freezy63Tc
[2:19:07] Flodimo: COPIUM
[2:19:08] shucoco: Also people that want to remove titles from 2s are so clueless man. 3s is the worst bracket by far
[2:19:11] hakunaxy: dont think cata will be dead think it will be insanly popular but we will see..
[2:19:19] freezytvx: XDDDDDDD
[2:19:20] freezytvx: cope
[2:19:20] bamboonas: @shucoco Overall perhaps but like I said I have never seen any streamer complain about cata pvp
[2:19:40] shucoco: If you queue 3s its only 2x r1player boosting someone

[2:20:47] cepsegnever: only bcos wotlk @hakunaxy
[2:20:50] shucoco: @hakunaxy wotlk
[2:20:50] freezytvx: its wotlk
[2:20:54] cepsegnever: cata was the begining of the end
[2:20:54] unimonosolo: the very very beginning of cata
[2:20:57] Flodimo: and the new players of cata were not enough to stop the decline of players
[2:21:00] freezytvx: cata is the expac where the game completly died
[2:21:02] freezytvx: and all quit it
[2:21:18] bamboonas: Mostly pvers quit
[2:21:22] unimonosolo: pvers cried about how hard heroic dungeons were
[2:21:26] bamboonas: Pvp was at it's peak in cata and mop
[2:21:28] hakunaxy: its absolute bullshit xD its actually not true at all that with cata the game died it had 12 million aktiv players pvp had a huge community
[2:21:34] ekunx: @unimonosolo no they loved it
[2:21:48] freezytvx: dude the cata pvp is the biggest cope on the planet
[2:21:50] freezytvx: stop coping please
[2:21:54] freezytvx: u can't be that braindead
[2:21:59] bamboonas: Only ever heard pvers complain about cata and for good reason too
[2:22:06] hakunaxy: when you look back for expample guys like braindeadly uploadet a video and in 4-5 hours it made half a million even going to 1.5 million views in 24 hours..

[2:23:03] freezytvx: i think stop speak about cata
[2:23:09] freezytvx: just wait it to come out
[2:23:16] hakunaxy: huge problem was alot of player sond manage to play with 25 upwards buttons its to hard for them..
[2:23:21] bamboonas: Dragon soul was kind of ass
[2:23:22] ekunx: @shucoco firelands and dragon soul are the worst raids ever
[2:23:35] ekunx: first tier is the best ever though Peepo
[2:23:53] unimonosolo: bastion of twilight was meh but BWD was cool
[2:23:53] hakunaxy: i mean if you compare cata to retail now its 10:1
[2:23:59] freezytvx: KEKW
[2:24:03] freezytvx: that guy is def on meds
[2:24:05] shucoco: First tier is pog, and dont forget we had naxx and togc in wotlk so
