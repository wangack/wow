[2:20:38] Molvonos: There's nothing inherently hard about reaching level 60 in HC, if you play carefully.
[2:21:25] Molvonos: I mean, you're comparing a top 100 (which is a race against time) to just reaching 60, with no time limit.
[2:22:13] sklingel: what does the enchant do
[2:22:20] MourvinMad: now top 100 to hit 60 on HC now wer're talkin
[2:22:43] Attackroot: watch it be an RNG drop from raid.. i can hear the REEEE Now
[2:22:45] Molvonos: Yea, if you're putting a time limit on reaching 60 in HC, I definitely agree to the difficulty
[2:23:02] Brodih_: @Molvonos true, the time constraint is a factor

[4:19:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK's tier set bonus is good, yeah, you can use it on the move
[4:19:52] whyyoudolikethat: ok i know what im gonna main hahaha
[4:20:09] Molvonos: @Towelliee Apparently the DK Set's helmet is unique in that it's rigged to your character's facial features, so when you Emote (/roar for example) the Mask actually animates.
[4:20:29] mejiro151: yay waycwest
[4:20:44] whyyoudolikethat: started to tank with dh last season bfa then dk now warrior xd

[4:21:02] Slitze: ah man i miss this dungeon and BFA
[4:21:08] wdotk: @Towelliee one of my favourite dungeons i used to tank with my prot warrior
[4:21:26] whyyoudolikethat: ow so the 4 set litterally has no point only dps increase ?
[4:21:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think you have to spend like 4 or 5 talent points to really get the most out of consecration
[4:21:57] nocturnal_2195: Seems like they were really lazy making the prot paladin tier set
[4:22:05] whyyoudolikethat: 4 set is free concecration ?
[4:22:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: The prot warrior set bonus seems kind of okay but I don't like consuming stacks of stuff, it is usually just more work
[4:22:42] Nebulizer87: same could be said for the current paltank tier
[4:22:48] Nebulizer87: both were meh compared to s1
[4:22:58] whyyoudolikethat: in my eyes they need to open there minds to new possebility's
[4:23:06] Nebulizer87: the holy pally tier set may be the laziest one
[4:23:09] whyyoudolikethat: like 4 set gives a new action etc ...
[4:23:14] Maydie6066: wall hax
[4:23:15] Cloudemon: that is the bfa experience
[4:23:22] Nebulizer87: remember they were supposed to be more like playstyle changing sets xD
[4:23:28] Molvonos: @Nebulizer87 Augvoker's pretty brainless too
[4:23:45] Snabido: Waycrest, how thy never disappoint Jebaited
[4:24:01] Molvonos: While Prevoker changes your play style a bit, requiring Flame Breath even in raid conditions to maximize your Living Flame  Echo output
[4:24:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: The guardian druid set relies on one talent ability, much like the frost DK one and probably some others, which forces you to pick that talent if you want any kind of benefit
[4:25:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'm not a fan of forcing people to pick a specific ability, it limits build diversity
[4:25:16] whyyoudolikethat: think you are good
[4:25:28] whyyoudolikethat: depends of adds etc
[4:26:11] whyyoudolikethat: anyone here plays lock
[4:26:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: ooooh another DC, ouch
[4:26:24] 3663Sharad: Atal crash, WM crash
[4:26:38] 3663Sharad: PTR seems unstable af
[4:29:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ybarra wouldn't do that to us!
[4:29:51] jesusdeoclin: its a 20 just with fortified
[4:29:54] Xunshia: Whats ur talents
[4:29:55] jesusdeoclin: ?
[4:31:19] TheItalianStallion321: @Molvonos i try to tell people aug is brainless with not much of a rotation and i get flamed lol

[6:10:26] WhackjobAU: You got a bugged one, it hit for 815k through Will of the Necropolis's 30% DR.
[6:10:36] WhackjobAU: There's no way it's intended to hit for over 1.1m
[6:10:39] screamnfetus: it's a double hit
[6:10:51] WhackjobAU: Not for 1.1m it ain't.
[6:10:55] screamnfetus: the reason you take it in the slow zone is to be able to move out of the second hit
