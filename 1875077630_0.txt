[1:38:14] opalwinfrey: i want dragonflight classic
[1:38:16] S1appadabass: at what point are we just back to modern WoW, last patch of Cata?
[1:38:23] robertjordan83: @Towelliee arent we beyond the concept of classic? anything but no change fresh servers isnt classic. so just go with "remaster/remake" concept instead
[1:38:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: i wasnt planning to play wotlk classic but i got talked into and just like i predicting it all fell apart around ulduar

[1:38:36] karaste: Well, if your idea of a prehistoric whole Azeroth thing comes true...maybe we avoid the cataclysm and then they can bring it back as classic ;)
[1:38:43] ninefingerszh: you still not have tusks?
[1:39:08] Brodih_: if polls says people will pay to play it, it will come out
[1:39:33] TweektheProphet: Classic = Vanilla, BC, Wod , Silver age = Cata, MOP , Wod , Modern age = Legion , BFA,  Shadowlands
[1:39:40] kokochris: KEK
[1:39:42] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[1:39:46] robbo1010: WutFace
[1:39:49] S1appadabass: Classicception
[1:39:51] ILikeKillTheZombies: next expansion would be on wow 20th anniversary, right?
[1:39:52] Honvar: Don't give them ideas :)
[1:39:56] duca_boom: it sounds kind of tin-foil-hatty  but also possible
[1:40:01] PotbellyGoat: BfA classic is going to be lit
[1:40:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: 11.0 we fixed the world!!!! here is cata classic if you want that shit

[1:40:41] demonicyoshi: or just hearth
[1:40:43] Tcrane_: Cata becomes classic and classic becomes "oldschool" or something
[1:40:47] kokochris: call it time travelling, and make it a feature where you can just play up to an Xpac as it was at version 'X'.  Open it up to all expansions
[1:40:57] Djfarmville: @HaxzorJimDuggan Popping 20 stacks tigereye + fists yeah
[1:41:02] ILikeKillTheZombies: they should make hogger a world boss in elwynn forest after revamp
[1:41:08] Elff11: you can min max more, just do that trick half way the fight @Towelliee  saves another 30 sec LUL
[1:41:10] homegift: what do you think the next expansion will be about @Towelliee ?
[1:41:32] homegift: you are answering already, sorry eheh
[1:41:38] N3llee: that actually sounds cool
[1:41:47] firehawk73: Zovaal was right the whole time
[1:41:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: or azeroth awakens and the world is essentially destroyed and azeroth becomes a chromie time zone only
[1:41:59] mavericks312: Ngl I’m over the whole being in Azeroth again
[1:42:19] akia03: so a troll xpac?
[1:42:28] geokouts: basically Pangaia :P
[1:42:32] AvrithSATX: I would sell my brother's souls for that expansion.
[1:42:47] ILikeKillTheZombies: i would prefer that over going to new island again

[1:43:27] SonofHorus82: it would be nice to have something on the existing world instead of readjusting the map again to make room for the next continent.
[1:43:27] Honvar: I don't care, as long as they make archeology relevant again @Towelliee :)
[1:43:28] mavericks312: Multiverse shit is what’s hot these days
[1:43:34] Outbreak815: i just want an excuse to be on kalimador and eastern kingdoms again. i miss those zones
[1:43:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: just dont ask them to relevel in diablo seasons Kappa
[1:43:54] CordovaGC: I say shut up an take my money
[1:43:57] homegift: Multiverse of Madness in WoW
[1:44:01] AvrithSATX: The timetravel / redo part is ok... I would just love an expac set in the ancient world and seeing the world "whole" with the ancient empires and locations etc.
[1:44:13] PokerFaceMoose: or end expansion with azeroth dying and having to move to an alternate universe
[1:44:13] mavericks312: Anything but kalimdor or eastern kingdom
[1:44:16] akia03: new planet or other side of azeroth seems more fun
[1:44:17] kokochris: I am hoping its something big.  I took a break, (mostly for D4). It would be fun to explore a new (old) world again
[1:44:23] Finansdepartementet: multiverse is for indecisive storytellers
[1:44:24] chill_xf: but then the expecation on the next xpac would be huge and i fear of another let down
[1:44:26] byrdeen45: just make it where we can fly with all our mounts not a fan of dragon riding
[1:44:36] demonicyoshi: if Azeroth does awaken wouldnt the planet be destroyed?
[1:44:41] garyoldmann: you think they would make leveling up feel meaningful like it does in classic, wotlk, etc?
[1:44:43] Snabido: How many plate chars do you have to kill garrosh with 👀
[1:44:45] kokochris: @PokerFaceMoose or going back to save it, but that will cause the world to "change" in the present

[4:00:11] akia03: just the import tax of 50% of it sucks

[4:04:35] pereadin: If not it’s a huge cuckfest
[4:04:43] Nerendis: No i mean the guantlet to it
[4:04:52] Nerendis: From tyr to EITHER war or morchie. This shit plus the portals

[4:22:20] Nerendis: So Chromie is gonna be the next aspect after Murozond right?
[4:22:26] ursinealli: no
[4:22:36] Jarlan23: shes the robin to nozdomus batman
[4:22:42] pereadin: It’s like a merithira type deal where she’s being trained to be one.
[4:22:43] Gruffian: She's probably going to be the Aspect
[4:22:47] Nerendis: No she's not an aspect. But she's pretty fucking strong. And probably will replace Noz
[4:22:58] EthicalHermit: Noz is always afraid he is going to turn into Murozond
[4:23:00] Warmanreaper: Didnt nozdormu stop using his power cause of the corruption?
[4:23:07] Starblaster_1: no shes not an aspect.. but she has really more influence than most of the other so your right..
[4:23:08] allisonkielle: It's because nozdormu surrendered himself to his fate and got apethetic because of it
[4:23:14] Nerendis: THIS TRASH - 100% key killer.
[4:23:15] abracka_: that sounds like a typical leader, usually absent while the lower rank does all the hard work
