[1:58:03] J_Walch: its cuz pallys have a such a massive player base and 80% are ass at the game, so they think they need to buff it

[2:00:01] im_capy: so its like Classic, they had there run and then expansions happened
[2:00:05] StickyTreez: but thats how it should be the tank meta should shift

[2:00:11] GingerGambit: I’m banking on brew and learning that right now
[2:00:14] bosseja: prot pally is great tho

[2:00:33] ColinHoot: buff moonkin
[2:00:36] MooniexVibes: I saw someone post about getting passed over as a BM…. And the post included a picture of their UI…. And they had like 4 core pieces of their rotation missing
[2:00:36] Sollice: Any any hunter that complains, minus Survival should shut up. And then Survival hunters should just learn to roll another class because its a dumb spec
[2:00:40] asmodai4823: were still in beta testing
[2:00:45] Molvonos: @killerteapotsftw YOU AROUND?  I NEED YOU TO MESSAGE ME HOMIE.
[2:00:53] Molvonos: I SEE YOU IN THE USER LIST.
[2:00:57] Yagr6: servers jajajaja
[2:00:57] JayPuppa: no theres just no chance. they need to completely redo the tree - consolidate, and reduce talents.
[2:01:15] jerseyfive: the guardian tree is a complete s#it show
[2:01:26] im_capy: on wowhead, the bear rotation starts with step 1...."Be in bear form" LUL ...the rotation needs some love
[2:01:26] ReactionDT: They named that spec survival because its fighting for its fucking life
[2:01:30] Sollice: HE IS ON EU STOP ASKING-KILLERTEAPOTSFTW MESSAGE MOLV

[2:02:19] ReactionDT: How have they redone the Guardian tree three times now and still have it fucked up
[2:02:21] GingerGambit: It’s either do damage or be somewhat tankier
[2:02:22] Sollice: @ReactionDT Survival actually should have gotten the rework first before Ret. Or simply remove the spec
[2:02:46] JayPuppa: Tactyks did the math and Raze is behind Maul by about 170%; concluded it wasnt worth the talent. Better to take ROTS.
[2:03:01] JayPuppa: when Maul procs*
[2:03:03] jjwoodard10: magic damage is the problem not physical
[2:03:05] mmo_kenna_: Evoker nerf feels bad, need to grind more gear to get the lost power back
[2:03:28] Sollice: @mmo_kenna_ The 5%? Really?
[2:03:33] Akillargaming: @Sollice maybe towelliee need put comment msg or  big screen lol
[2:03:47] JayPuppa: @jjwoodard10 the problem is the lack of avoidance for bears; we can dodge and mitigate. other tanks have 3-4+ options to avoid damage (parry, block, reflect, etc.)

[4:28:44] cprGhost: @OhNoNotAgain Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:28:45] papascruge: pretty sure he made it just as a farm raid team right?
[4:28:46] looney199725: pretty sure he did some online contract sign up shit to even join the guild
[4:28:50] 91Niki: Trim the damn trees Blizzard towRee
[4:28:59] rehabz97: probably the same as this tier, max finishes with liquid and then farm with his other guild
[4:29:02] looney199725: ye ik what u on about
[4:29:06] Theduskflyer: He raids with them. Lol 😂
[4:29:14] looney199725: the race lasts like 2 weeks
[4:29:18] rehabz97: maybe find some new ppl to give cutting edge
[4:29:18] looney199725: so i dont think they care
[4:29:29] ketchup_wmbg: busy with ur dad
[4:29:45] umphries: my guess is they just gear up for mythic while he is doing the race just like this tier. after 2 weeks he will be able to raid with them
[4:30:48] looney199725: wooop hogwarts is rdy to play
[4:30:53] looney199725: lets see how gd the game rly is
[4:31:22] Theduskflyer: Max has a “ Community” guild. Shroud is part of it. I assume the gonna chill while RTWF is going on, then once he’s done, he’ll come back and they will prog. I think that’s what he said when he started up this guild.

[4:40:08] Heero_Effect: Annie and Dan seem to be enjoying good viewership on hog warts legacy
[4:40:08] Foxdoabarrelrofl: if pepples values were in everythng they buy you couldnt buy anything ffs
[4:40:14] lovedless: @chrslp she still hets her share of the rights purchase
[4:40:20] lovedless: *gets
[4:40:31] IceMECH: as a part of the 40+ crowd, i miss the days when people with different beliefs/opinions could sit down and have an intelligent conversation or even just enjoy each other's company for a beer
[4:40:37] Molvonos: No, she was paid her royalties at the beginning.
[4:40:44] sacredarrow: @heero_effect  Annie went 15 hours yesterday dizzyLul dizzyLul

[4:41:08] xmedpakx: how funny ppl make a stand on this but not against other big business that may or may not treat ppl well etc
[4:41:13] Foxdoabarrelrofl: yea well if we are gonna apply logic to every narrative then be consistent
[4:41:38] thebakeriscomingforu: The IGN review was so bad. bugs, system issues, story problems but 9/10. LOL
[4:41:59] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  nice hat man gz on the kyrie trade :)
[4:42:05] lovedless: Other business keep that sh** behind closed doors. Rowling just goes full Twitter Karen.
[4:42:08] thebakeriscomingforu: I'll be curious what the reviews will be once it is properly released.
[4:42:10] mavericks312: im suprised sloot is streaming hogwarts
[4:42:13] theDirtyon3: correct
[4:42:18] Reckless_Monk: its a Wizarding World game
[4:42:20] stephens0197: Harry Potter is the final boss
[4:42:29] NippponSteel: Not even about hogwarts either
[4:42:30] dreamwalker213: Harry pogger straight outta pogwarts
[4:42:39] xghostyyx: The funny part is the game uses non gendered language and non binary avatar's
[4:42:40] largefromage: koolWALLY
[4:42:42] NippponSteel: hogwarts is part of it but not what the game is based around
[4:42:42] blightsteel88: Just downloaded Hogwarts legacy, cant wait to play later
[4:42:45] TheCliffyShow: People go for whatever the new hot controversy is. In a few weeks they will forget about it, and move on to the next thing.
[4:42:46] im_capy: I think if you like elden ring, you might like it too? seems like fighting bosses is similar
[4:42:52] Eviltuna13: It takes place in the 1800’s
[4:42:55] schrad3rrrrrrr: What server you play on ?

[4:43:35] Heero_Effect: Lol hogwarts gonna kill my WoW guild. People in our discord are talking  about it
[4:43:37] Raxxiety: people need to get off their high horse and let people believe what they want, if it doesn't align with your beliefs, move on, don't try to push your beliefs on another
[4:43:54] theDirtyon3: if i am not mistaken
[4:44:05] Prycey: @Kavalry47 also the headmaster being related to sirus black and harry
[4:44:16] ZeusDNA: Can we avoid talking about who's who in the game to avoid spoilers please?
[4:44:21] TheCliffyShow: All the controversy probably helped the game more then anything. Gave it more attention.
[4:44:44] Molvonos: Moving onto another convo.  Spoilers will be deleted and repeated attempts will result in timeouts.
[4:44:45] Kavalry47: @theDirtyon3 that too but for the rest of the game there is little HP mentions
[4:44:54] atsq1: How’s pally dog increase?
