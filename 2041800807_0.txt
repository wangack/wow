[1:07:32] nurotv: outlaw doesn‚Äôt look good
[1:07:36] coffeexcakez: isnt the bottom right talent good?
[1:07:52] Gwaelii: It also breaks roots so you can use it to get out of totem instead of cloaking
[1:07:55] danger_daft: killing spree isn't bad but need full 6 or 7 combo points
[1:07:55] kryplix: no
[1:07:58] RogueStabin: outlaw is prob best out of the 3

[1:11:03] tigerslap_ow: there is a script that you can run to disable those error popups during the match
[1:11:11] timmah25: you used killing spree with 3 combo points
[1:11:12] Whaazz: If u press BTE before u meld it shows its ready, u can test it on a dummy right now, its rly annoying tho
[1:11:13] barbarian_hardcore: do some sub 2s

[1:13:24] railander: only one way to find out Pog
[1:13:29] Shifthappens23: always been random targets
[1:13:30] Miyagix: its been like that since wotlk as far as i know
[1:13:31] zy78x: ye
[1:13:34] atorob: i thought it used to hit multiple targets?

[1:13:36] bagofcans88: Pika new to rogue
[1:13:40] capslockcaptain: yea its random targets within a short range of the person u use it on
[1:13:41] gorillazclinteastwood: outlaw better than sub?
[1:13:41] vaggos_t: its single target
[1:13:52] Miyagix: try it haha
[1:13:58] Ntro201: no it hasnt
[1:13:58] atorob: Im not sure, always thought it hit more than one, youd be the one id ask though haha
[1:14:02] timmah25: yes use it as a defensive too
[1:14:04] overrrlord12: try 3 rounds NON KS 3 rounds with KS

[1:17:02] Peeachy0: done main team 3s?
[1:17:03] Miyagix: xD
[1:17:03] Ntro201: Killing Spree works with Blade Flurry, so popping both will make the rogue attack additional targets instead of focusing on the rogue's main target.
[1:17:05] aTactical: People do be silly
[1:17:06] SARGO69: bring back wod killing spree

[1:17:37] Shifthappens23: "Step through the shadows from enemy to enemy within 10 yards, attacking an enemy every .5 secs with both weapons until 5 assaults are made," it literally says it in the tool tip
[1:17:43] vaggos_t: ks do good dmg too

[1:18:59] dpsEric: they might play with jelly in a bit
[1:19:29] vaggos_t: Patch 5.4.0 (2013-09-10): Targeting has been changed. If Blade Flurry is not active, Killing Spree will now hit the Rogue's target 7 times or pick the closest eligible target if none had been selected. Killing Spree will continue to work as it has while Blade Flurry is active.
[1:19:30] itachiiii1212: got the heavenly onyx to drop today and have only tried it on two characters for like a year on and off lol todays a good day.

[2:44:31] dakneeee: yeah, shark fin crit, the double swords is 10% damage increase with bladeflurry up
[2:44:32] XDANK_WEEDX: 15 yards is unfortunately not very far for roll to bones pvp talent
[2:44:32] inhumed: you want precision, true bearing and broadsides
[2:44:34] sixthycent: shark buff
[2:44:37] Fayce123: KEKW
[2:44:38] histimix: buff = good

[2:48:09] gamer_dad_01: 7 wins
[2:48:10] sixthycent: shark buffy
[2:48:14] Never_Salty: Sub is dead
[2:48:15] theJUDGEtr: the double jerk celly nice
[2:48:18] Arthyius: no way outlaw is the move over sub what is happening
[2:48:20] sixthycent: whazz knows the buffs man
[2:48:22] sixthycent: you gotta  learn
[2:48:22] Never_Salty: R I P
[2:48:29] calebito_: dont shave tbh
[2:48:29] Nachofez: is sub ass for real? theres no way
[2:48:43] volxine: only nerds track that
[2:48:44] snigelguden: shark buff is crazy
[2:48:46] filoxvx: sub dead sadly
[2:48:48] 8burntchicken4: where is the Sterge PoV for my healer friend he wants to take notes on how to remain calm and cool
[2:48:55] sixthycent: yea more shark uptime
[2:48:56] warlord_packyak: refresh it
[2:48:59] Shanman_: the haste buff for teammates is way too huge to not have it slamming
[2:48:59] sixthycent: if u like a buff you have
[2:49:01] gamer_dad_01: you keep a buff and get new ones
[2:49:02] inhumed: you can have 3 buffs
[2:49:02] sixthycent: rerroll
[2:49:02] Shanman_: spamming
[2:49:04] fiveturp: so get thge shark and keep gettings
[2:49:08] fiveturp: getting it^
[2:49:12] lexokream: @Pikabooirl It means that it picks a random roll the bones it refreshes it
[2:49:13] theJUDGEtr: why do you have greens
[2:49:16] Zerolol123: the guys who told you to play outlaw told you to maximize shark uptime LUL
[2:49:18] inhumed: so you want to roll, AR then roll again later and have 3 buffs for 30+ seconds
[2:49:22] calebito_: it means if ti rolls a buff you already have it uop you get a different oen so it jsut means you have more buffs up consistently
[2:49:22] Saltyfriez76: Thanks for 1 month sub btw pika
[2:49:22] slinger_007: so you always keep one of the buffs
[2:49:26] dakneeee: have you seen the fist weapons from the raid for outlaw? @Pikabooirl
[2:49:28] SMOrc_Face_SMOrc: say you have grand melee + buried treasure, when you rtb, one of those will be guaranteed + new rtb buffs
[2:49:29] Huntardness: yse
[2:49:35] lexokream: Itll keep picking a random one to refresh and get rid of the rest
[2:49:39] Windnecro: you get your roll + a refresh if you hit different buffs

[2:58:04] JNCslasher: ahhh
[2:58:15] JNCslasher: rng buffs?
[2:58:26] magnesiium1: so if you keep all your buffs up they keep the other up by extension
[2:58:32] crymorre: @JNCslasher https://www.wowhead.com/spell=424044/underhanded-upper-hand
[2:58:34] magnesiium1: more of a rotation thing i think with some luck
[2:58:54] socknapper1990: Assass isn't better than outlaw??
[2:58:59] JNCslasher: outlaw deff more skill caped then other specs looks nasty
[2:59:23] drfeltgood: You need a ton of WA for outlaw
[2:59:32] ixiamain: Yall are rank 1
[2:59:56] HoodsShadow: that was a troll ass clone
[3:00:01] Schwantes2: It feels like the whole game is about stopping clone
[3:00:06] aTactical: All these games seem so stressful lol
[3:00:12] Kanooog: Being Clone is probably the most annoying CC
[3:00:22] Kanooog: Cloned*
[3:00:40] Schwantes2: you should be able to grip or knock your teamates out of clone
[3:00:59] ixiamain: Balance is the most fun caster ever bro
[3:01:02] housemannn: Good good good good
[3:01:05] billybrown95: Eat your food!!!
[3:01:11] saren8: Hey Pika how do you mentally swap everything's hotkey when in stealth / dance? Like your kidney and everything else just move to different hotkeys??
[3:01:14] lexokream: I still think you should break your rule to get a weak aura for Roll the Bones
[3:01:21] Kanooog: @Schwantes2 That would be awesome
[3:01:27] realdreadx: sippin on dat yakk?
[3:01:34] gordonramsayfan69: KEKW
[3:01:50] Kanooog: @ixiamain They are also one of the highest targeted classes in the game... not the most fun senario for a lot of people.
[3:01:57] Ernanz: you big cooldowns are too far
[3:02:07] Bombaclaet_Rogue: @Pikabooirl u dont want ur buffs closer to the middle of screen?
[3:02:09] nurotv: tmw

[3:02:18] Damitongo: jelly is the carrt

[3:02:27] tengo6: best way to play

[3:03:38] thefoolishprophet: yo pika what‚Äôs up
[3:03:41] bonaphil: is that why sub is better? You never have to double check if you have subterfuge because it's got 100% uptime
[3:03:41] HurricaneTommy_: @HurricaneTommy_ so weird that outlaw is bis haha
[3:03:46] JesusTbyte: No adds for me
[3:03:50] ZephyrinDark: I use them, just saying the game would be more skill-based and fun if they weren't a thing to set up for so many hours, since a massive percent of the game is optimizing UI @railander
[3:04:15] thefoolishprophet: thefoolishprophet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! is sub ass now?
[3:04:16] railander: @ZephyrinDark this makes literally no sense. addons augment gameplay, not reduce the skill ceiling.
[3:05:00] Schwantes2: addons for sure make the game easier
[3:05:26] ZephyrinDark: they do, which lowers the skill ceiling because the gameplay becomes more about REACTING and not about AWARENESS
[3:05:32] sande111: DendiFace SMOrc GlitchCat
[3:05:52] ZephyrinDark: WoW isn't that complicated rn as it is, the abilities and everything are so pruned compared to MoP / WotLK for example, which had way more mechanics
