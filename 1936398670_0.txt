[1:14:32] foxxys856: well going from whats said on social media, streamers playing it currently and such going from whats put out there one can only use what they see unless alalytics are shown which is a fair assessment
[1:14:33] mavericks312: ppl out here watching Bellular videos an taking them as end all be all
[1:14:54] notdustinx: I play both versions actively and I would agree a lot more classic people talk about what they’re excited about than retail but that doesn’t mean they aren’t excited
[1:15:01] TheLoho: @Dark_Kornax because people are googling it then that means more people play it? Could it be perhaps... because it's new?? There's a lot of new content around HC???? HMMMMM
[1:15:18] abracka_: "google trends is showing wow as not being searched, and nobody logged into my guild. game is dead"

[1:16:20] mavericks312: classic is healthy now, was damn near dead with only wrath
[1:16:24] zeeAbe: Coincidentally the google trends go together with massive ad campaigns every single time LUL
[1:16:37] Thoreya: wrath is literally raid log LUL
[1:16:50] Gingerprimer: Also the only endgame contet in classic is rading
[1:16:52] Norori: LFR doesnt parse exactly
[1:16:52] DunzoCD: gottem
[1:16:58] jerkchickenpapi: I just feel like classic and HC are kinda pointless. Besides nostalgia what else does the experience provide? At least in retail you’re making progress towards something and that progress is being transferred over to continuation of the story.
[1:17:00] Z3azza: are you gona play cs2 ?
[1:17:10] ashwing_: KEKW
[1:17:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: We do need more LFR parses!
[1:17:16] Mr_Arson: The people who are playing retail are just playing retail, not really engaging in outside content like videos and things like that which makes people think that retail is dying
[1:17:28] mavericks312: @jerkchickenpapi careful now you gonna get the boomers to riot

[1:17:35] Stiffy84: My tank had no clue how to do this either lol
[1:17:51] ashwing_: @jerkchickenpapi Thats the point Classic people dont want to progress trough 20 years of content so now they want new content but in Classic LUL
[1:17:53] NickLeonhearth: my tank was smart
[1:17:55] NickLeonhearth: he asked what to do
[1:17:57] ElmSpace: why has wow evolved from horde vs alliance to classic vs retail lol
[1:17:58] ArcaneMaki: Can you believe WoW is almost 19 years old?
[1:17:58] Gingerprimer: @jerkchickenpapi is  mostly nostalgia and the fact that few current games have the same gameplay
[1:17:59] mavericks312: @Mr_Arson retail is having its best rentention xpac since legion but sure retail is dying
[1:18:01] falldrgn: People think they can just face roll this fight..even now it still SUCKS
[1:18:01] DunzoCD: ive had to explain this fight to the tank last 2 times i got this dungeon LUL

[1:18:56] vulkankragon: classic people want new content? alright they will get burning crusade HC LUL
[1:19:01] TheGiant99: Alot of newer players didn't do cata

[1:19:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Coach him up, yeah
[1:19:49] Thoreya: than a*
[1:20:06] notdustinx: Teach him
[1:20:14] jerkchickenpapi: Classic is just a nice time dump if we’re keeping it real. I’m sure it is fun. It’s just that everything you’ve done has already been done and you aren’t really making progress in the game since it’s already been done before and you know how the story ends. It’s all nostalgia man.
[1:20:14] Rainadin: @Thoreya Kappa ?
[1:20:19] mavericks312: @Thoreya imagine this place in the m+ rotation
[1:20:20] Thoreya: LUL LUL LUL
[1:20:24] foxxys856: this is one of the problems in this game atm somone died a few times other than yourself they insta vote to kick without trying to help
[1:20:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah he probably just didn't know the fight at all
[1:20:33] Thoreya: @mavericks312 would rather play in traffic
[1:20:56] jasperboy: jasperboy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 143 months, currently on a 143 month streak! 
[1:20:57] Rainadin: Cata TW is faceroll. Don't know how groups can't lol.
[1:21:04] filnrotrai: probably a bot. lol
[1:21:06] mavericks312: you cant make ppl accept the help you are offering
[1:21:18] motorboatingpro: i didnt know you were bilingual, i tried to learn spanish, never got practical use to keep it
[1:21:30] vulkankragon: @jerkchickenpapi classic has story??
[1:21:34] NickLeonhearth: @foxxys856 i love that comment, because 90% before kicking some1, you write to them, try and explain and no response...so kick
[1:21:44] mavericks312: @Thoreya you may actually survive the traffic tbf lol not surviving this
[1:21:45] NickLeonhearth: and then the reddit posts come with oooo the toxicity
[1:22:12] byrdeen45: LOL streamers are mean
[1:22:21] mavericks312: cata is easy if the players know the dungeons
[1:22:25] DunzoCD: not looking forward to Shadowpan next week though
[1:22:40] foxxys856: @NickLeonhearth ive had simlar experinace i had a stroke so my moveemnt as a tank wasnt the best as recovering due to a death they intsa voted to kick me without explaining
[1:22:42] falldrgn: its face roll tho..
[1:22:44] ElmSpace: stonecore and blackrock caverns seem tougher than the others
[1:22:44] mavericks312: give me shado-pan 15s
[1:22:58] TheGiant99: Doesn't help the player base has no patience
[1:23:06] Rainadin: Really? I haven't noticed LUL Then again I run with people who do 20s.
[1:23:18] mavericks312: @ElmSpace ive had a harder time in tol'vir so far then stonecore
[1:23:19] SonofHorus82: sometimes I wonder if people look to see if they're playing with a streamer and then they try to show off just to do it all wrong and get kicked. Then they go to mmo champ to make a whining post about people having opinions.
[1:23:25] temp3st98: Cant wait when someone in the crowd at blizzcon yells i love you to metzen LULW
[1:23:28] Nerdy1: That was my issue coming back to right before DF released. I didn't know any of the dungeons as I didn't play the previous two expansions. People in dungeon finder weren't really trying to help and explain the mechanics. I just kept getting kicked. that was upsetting
[1:23:28] filnrotrai: so we have timewalkign for the next 5 weeks correct?
[1:24:03] falldrgn: Thats Magist...
[1:24:14] rasquache: how do you feel about locks?
[1:24:16] ArcaneMaki: Wondering if one of Metzen mandate was to make Anduinn a man again.
[1:24:17] IglooMan45: I love Arcane Mage

[1:25:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK isn't the easiest tank to start with, but it is better than it used to be for new tanks
[1:26:05] mavericks312: @ElmSpace he was a prob even in cata ppl dont care to stop dps when he puts his reflect up
[1:27:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: Runic power management used to be horrible delicate, I think generally it's just easier now
[1:27:13] mavericks312: it might be bugged i havent gotten one yet
[1:27:19] dimofodi: I didn't get any token?
[1:27:24] madhatterui: i was thinking the same thing, i didn't get one
[1:27:26] mavericks312: ive done it with 4 max lvl toons and no token/item
[1:27:31] andy_4000: oh i was gonna say
[1:27:33] DeanoTV: its just the buff, it changes when u do 4
[1:27:42] dimofodi: I completed the weekly on max level and didn't get anything but a heroic satchel instead of normal satchel.
[1:27:51] mavericks312: cause it was supposed to give you an item you can send to alts
[1:27:56] fewyn: the blue item is supposed to be a potion but it doesn't seem to exist
[1:27:56] firehawk73: Yeah, the BoA potion

[1:28:46] andy_4000: bfa time walking will be intresting
[1:29:11] DunzoCD: maybe the potion is a toy we get at the end to always be able to level alts faster towCopium
[1:29:18] icerasta: when you are at 70, this dungeon gives you 2 "dungeons complete" for the weekly quest. So that is pretty cool
[1:29:20] Airwaves_Gamer: Maybe hoping that is why they are bring servers down today for maintenance, maybe get those potions to drop.  Be nice for sure

[2:10:39] Aquadriel: metzen wasnt even that good
[2:10:50] Pallyofhell: classic players getting their hopes up
[2:11:07] temp3st98: @Aquadriel but more people trust him than most blizz employees
[2:11:24] ItsNobbie: the culture at Blizzard is toxic, from top down
[2:11:28] Sollice: Mellow? Did that person play Shadowloands?
[2:11:33] cryft: liking someone's creative works doesnt mean you have to approve of their entire self. thrall is thrall
[2:11:34] TombStoneMercenary: mellow= chill or lame
[2:11:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Burning the tree was not mellow
[2:12:02] Aquadriel: temp3st98 because blizzard fans are boomers who only want orcs vs humans shit lol they living on 2004
[2:12:08] warrenny: @tombstonemercenary Chill doesnt mean lame
[2:12:10] Aquadriel: metzen fans*
[2:12:11] Pallyofhell: burning the tree was the happiest day
[2:12:23] snackpakahoy0: will it be worth coming back to wrath with icc coming out?
[2:12:29] valianya: Did he replace a different person as Executive Creative Director?  Or did they create a new position for him?
[2:12:30] supernerdcallme2fast4u: why are servers going down
[2:12:35] TombStoneMercenary: @warrenny sure it does depends on how chill it is
[2:12:36] Pallyofhell: classic+ copium LUL
[2:12:42] PadidinJones: WTF is classic+ supposed to be?
[2:12:55] flebbooo: LUL
[2:12:57] temp3st98: @Aquadriel lol yes because i rather have war than lame cuddles every cinematic
[2:13:03] Sicknessqt: If blizz focuses on classic more than retail then they deserve to be shit on tbf LUL
[2:13:06] Big_Snarly: I don't miss those days.  Already lived through it once.
[2:13:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: That's true, a hype crash is not going to be fun
[2:13:13] Pallyofhell: going to bathe in classic+ tears
[2:13:24] Sollice: Blizz isn't going to focus more on classic than retail. Where do you people come up with this
[2:13:28] MoonwalkingAngel: whatever blizz does expect negative critisism
[2:13:36] PadidinJones: @Pallyofhell Sell that bath water man
[2:13:52] Aquadriel: Sollice delusional metzen fanbois
[2:13:59] 91Niki: KEKW
[2:14:05] ItsNobbie: Ion was just a minor setback
[2:14:07] mavericks312: the vanilla approach would kill wow
[2:14:09] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[2:14:16] Pallyofhell: the forums will melt your brain
[2:14:18] TheGiant99: We need to go back to horde vs alliance

[2:14:24] Big_Snarly: Your the World Boss getting raided by ...  people.
[2:14:31] TombStoneMercenary: That ship sailed long ago
[2:14:39] TheRiwen: why not
[2:14:40] Pallyofhell: general discussion is a nightmare right now
[2:14:42] 91Niki: OMEGALUL
[2:14:44] SonofHorus82: I am a 100% Classic Andy. I would much rather play Wrath Classic than Retail right now. But these people have lost their fucking minds.
[2:14:46] Sollice: @Aquadriel Not really a metzen thing though this classic nonsense has been talked about for a while. Like this classic+ coming out of no where
[2:14:50] kone_malone: LOL
[2:14:53] MZSinaloa: lirikLIT
[2:14:55] Malarick: general cesspool?

[2:15:22] Bulldawgx: Oh come on @towelliee   General Discussion quick view for us lol
[2:15:22] Aquadriel: Sollice You are correct, but the metzen news brought it back and amplified it for some reason as you can see from those posts KEKW
[2:15:28] Sollice: Yeah
[2:15:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think Metzen has plenty to add, but that they're not going to trashcan what they've been working on
[2:15:46] Pallyofhell: classic players are highly delusional
[2:15:49] TheGiant99: Alot don't like DF
[2:15:50] Romnus: Close, its people who haven't played DF and assume its bad
[2:15:52] supernerdcallme2fast4u: its a phone game expansion
[2:15:56] segarth: Why is classic+ being talked about so much lately? Did something happen?
[2:16:00] Pittyboy: @Towelliee Is there much being announced at Blizzcon that you dont know about or do you pretty much know it all?
[2:16:10] Sollice: @segarth NO its just people pulling crap out their ass
[2:16:12] PadidinJones: @Towelliee is there any indication that he was involved?

[2:17:40] Pallyofhell: that shimone person worries me about the future of the human race
[2:17:48] PadidinJones: Guilty by association...
[2:17:54] Celicon: What happen?
[2:18:07] 91Niki: @Towelliee reading the wowhead comments https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/317/096/526.gif
[2:18:11] cpawannabegamer: Man I hate some people in the WoW community. Was healing on my alt in blackrock caverns and multiple people died on first boss from one shot mechanic. Proceeded to blame me and continued to die from mechanics and blame me on everything
[2:18:23] warrenny: The guilty people are gone tho right
[2:18:24] Effin_Steffin: lol that eyebrows comment took me out
[2:18:37] valianya: He's not in charge of personnel.  He's only in charge of high level story direction.  He's not even in direct control of questlines
[2:18:53] 91Niki: Wait Blizzard is in the money making business ??? pikaOMG
[2:19:03] Valestrus: people dont know what a business actually is... xD
[2:19:04] Pallyofhell: its the classic community that is pulling all this random shit out their asses
[2:19:04] Shugaze: I believe in the WoW Remake rumors
[2:19:11] ItsNobbie: Metzen the Rampensau
[2:19:11] Delkamus04: towCopium towCopium People out here breathing real deep
[2:19:12] flebbooo: the wow community has some rare kinda copium unlike any other
[2:19:14] pk99: HORDE Pog ALLIANCE Pog
[2:19:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lok'tar Ogar!
[2:19:17] kokochris: whats this make money !?!
[2:19:19] Tyrolore: "GEEK IS"
[2:19:20] DunzoCD: wait so the story director doesnt decide if theres a WoW token? Kappa
[2:19:34] 91Niki: @Shugaze towCopium Don't overdose on that copium
[2:19:38] Finiin: I just don't want the faction wars back. I'm over it at this point, There's so much more to WoW with the void and light and stuff
[2:19:41] Vondrex: Make wow great again
[2:19:42] Aquadriel: WoW 2 happened 17 years ago, its called TBC
[2:19:42] kokochris: KEKW
[2:19:54] Sollice: I find it funny so many people want wow to fundamentially change in to something completely different than what it is. Play a new game..It's ok...you will not be hurt by doing that
[2:20:00] cryft: token is a tencent decision 🤔
[2:20:06] ijuki: What about retail+ Kappa
[2:20:22] Pallyofhell: yea how about retail+ Kappa
[2:20:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think we can go back the whole way, we have cross-faction stuff in the game and more in development
[2:20:30] 91Niki: @Sollice The thing is, if you asked the same people to build a game from the ground up, of their so called "vision" of what it should be... they couldn't LUL
[2:20:32] Perseus_IRL: what the la\test rumors on the next expansion?
[2:20:49] ijuki: @Pallyofhell A man of culture I see SeemsGood
[2:20:53] Eviltuna13: The great Gnome uprising will be soon cohhParty
[2:20:55] kolyy99: I wished they reset the universe in lore somehow and the game at the same time like in f14
[2:20:59] MoonwalkingAngel: cool shirt bro
[2:20:59] Sollice: @91Niki EXACTLY. WE WANTA NEW ENGINE!!!! Why to make the game look like something that's not WoW? WE WANT....UHHHH...things
[2:21:06] deestreezy: Thats how i feel when i go to walmart, always fighting orcs and trolls
[2:21:10] warrenny: No more faction war pls ( i love bfaand mop)
[2:21:10] Colt_Engineer: I love being able to play together
[2:21:16] Gingerprimer: Next exapnsion Crossfaction paused untill the first raid is defeated
[2:21:18] Romnus: Yeah at this point I think faction wars and the alliance vs horde thing is outdated
[2:21:19] 91Niki: @Eviltuna13 More gnomes to punt? We love to see it cohhParty
[2:21:27] nostreamerstream: theres no WoW 2
[2:21:29] kone_malone: Huge stretch but I think itd be cool for CHOSEN factions not based on race
[2:21:31] warrenny: Ok if cross faction stays go for it
[2:21:34] DunzoCD: if BFA would have come out when cata did, it would have been way more hyped up story, people were more into ally vs horde back then
[2:21:36] Shugaze: it became OW
[2:21:38] Finiin: @Colt_Engineer Same here
[2:21:38] unowncreature: I want them to fix the factions. They are still in this weird spot since SL.
[2:21:43] Sollice: @deestreezy PERFECT example....Yeah if you want to fight orcs and trolls go to Wal Mart on a weekend evening or wait for Black Friday. That shit is crazy
[2:21:44] HaloS23: Titan - Overwatch
[2:21:44] 91Niki: @Sollice Yeah, they don't know what they want
[2:21:50] warrenny: titan?
[2:21:58] cgolden1a: wildstar jab?
[2:22:02] pigzip: When housing comes out, I better not be living next-door to an alliance player
[2:22:03] Pallyofhell: "you think you do but you don't"
[2:22:16] Sollice: @unowncreature Explain what you want to change
[2:22:29] nocturnal_2195: @deestreezy KEKW
[2:22:34] 91Niki: @unowncreature Define fix? How do we fix it? You can't just throw the word fix around without coming up with something constructive to actually fix it
[2:22:40] Scoodles91: its time for anduin to go nuts and start a war "D
[2:22:41] Meliea_EU: war can be isntantly back before you know it there is war like in real life
[2:22:44] Finiin: I just want more story with Calia and her being light undead
[2:23:00] MoonwalkingAngel: just make it seperate zone like ff14
[2:23:02] Elips: is Towlliee the last bastion of retail streamers?
[2:23:07] Pallyofhell: war will probably break out again with the light vs void again
[2:23:11] warrenny: We go to war we make peace we go to war we make peace yawn weve done it enough
[2:23:11] Mecabeast: I like how ff14 did their 3 major factions
[2:23:12] Effin_Steffin: apartment with a gnome... get me tf..
[2:23:13] Sollice: STEVE......YOUR TAUREN WIFE SHIT ON MY YARD AGAIN
[2:23:14] Kelticlore: If housing comes i want some in dalaran
[2:23:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: If there is housing for neutral factions, you may have an Alliance neighbor
[2:23:20] Rainadin: Yeah I doubt they go the Archeage route with housing
[2:23:25] Meliea_EU: i would prefer we have war back its warcraft not peace, and we need races split from factions
[2:23:30] Clicklesly: They fixed the factions by eliminating them, it's all the same thing now ^^
[2:23:35] Finiin: Lux is still playing retail wow sometimes
[2:23:40] Meliea_EU: its 4pm
[2:23:48] valianya: I think it might be okay to create splinter renegade storylines just for pvp.  Like Sylvanas loyalists but having players pick to be renegade means they can pvp stir shit up without a full faction war.  They'd be like Defias going rogue and being criminal
[2:23:51] 丂卄仨仨仨丂卄: HC
[2:23:54] 丂卄仨仨仨丂卄: classic
[2:24:10] Pallyofhell: HC classic is softcore. make it ironman rules

[2:24:27] theszoti: metzen will probably continue with the cosmic wars storyline he layed the foundations for back in chronicles #1
[2:24:28] Sollice: @valianya World PVP is such a small and basically unplayed part of WoW
[2:24:40] duffluv22: Best raid ever
[2:24:44] Ckraigfriend: jbotb its playing rumble now
[2:25:06] 91Niki: "This pixel looks out of place... could this possibly... be a sign of the new expansion??? cohhO "
[2:25:10] valianya: But its a choice and its not a permanent criminal flag
[2:25:41] Kelticlore: Imo factions should of been removed late MOP  or early WOD

[2:25:43] dright424: I think the general storyline will remain the same in retail, but there might be a bit of a change in focus to give it a more original feel
[2:25:44] TheUnknowing: shadowlands, the dark times.
[2:25:45] Pallyofhell: shadowlands is someones nephew or niece doing the story
[2:25:46] Mecabeast: I mean there's still a big baddie out there that the jailer was worried about
[2:25:47] im_capy: Bfa felt like he started it, but left before it was fully finished

[2:31:51] SonofHorus82: I could play Classic Era Ret Pally just fine on a controller. Hell I could get it done on an old NES controller.
[2:31:51] dannyis1337: ESO and FF does console MMO WoW can too but I hope not
[2:31:58] Valseki: We'll see - Im just guessing - it just seems like they are going that way with some of the things they are adding
[2:32:03] castiegaming: Ff14 on console and I got a lot of buttons to hit
[2:32:08] 91Niki: Lets be honest, the REAL reason MS bough Acti Blizz is cuz of candy crush. The rest is just bonuses
[2:32:09] HaloS23: i realy think its more of a "you do you boo" relationship
[2:32:09] mavericks312: MS hasnt pushed any company they purchased why would they start now
[2:32:13] warrenny: Whys the token stop it on xbox?
[2:32:14] Valseki: yea, but FFXIV has a ton of buttons
[2:32:15] SonofHorus82: the real end game is playing wow on a DDR Dancepad.
[2:32:25] mavericks312: @castiegaming your forgetting console cant have addons
[2:32:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: ESO's combat has few buttons

[2:33:00] signeddudu: maybe for alt leveling...
[2:33:00] Sacred_Wrath: Nope
[2:33:01] bygodwest: In a heartbeat
[2:33:02] tumb_tack: MAKE A POLL
[2:33:02] castiegaming: If I want to casually play on the couch lol
[2:33:03] Aussie_Kanga: nope
[2:33:04] IgneousLion: be stupid to do that
[2:33:06] brazkat: i dont think people could properly do higher keys on controllers
[2:33:06] im_capy: controller on my desk has 3 inches of dust for a reason
[2:33:08] z3r0forty: imagine all the addons youd miss out on
[2:33:10] SonofHorus82: absolutely not
[2:33:13] mavericks312: also if you say yes remember without addons your not getting invited to shit
[2:33:14] Valseki: But you are talking in extremes - you can use both
[2:33:14] Aidler: Wow VR
[2:33:16] dannyis1337: its too add players not give players options
[2:33:16] TheUnknowing: if you say yes you are trolling
[2:33:16] herzlustafir: 40 buttons? id like to see them try
[2:33:23] wildragehs44: i wont
[2:33:24] GTmask: No, cuz I has a brain.
[2:33:27] castiegaming: Not everyone does that content
[2:33:29] MsAriez: blizzard would have to dumb down wow so much just to funtion on console
[2:33:29] JeremyTheHand: I would totally spend farming sessions on my couch with controler
[2:33:30] SonofHorus82: @Pallyofhell be one hell of a workout.
[2:33:30] mayonaes: not completely but laying in bed at night running misc task would be cool on console.
[2:33:32] tonyr23: No addon support on console

[2:33:45] DrkPhoenix6913: never in a mission years would i step away from PC play
[2:33:51] Divinos572: It would just be for leveling for me, just to chill on the couch
[2:33:51] DrkPhoenix6913: million not mission
[2:33:51] lawles_walrus: tahts why i bought diablo twice
[2:33:51] MorteaWolf17: players*

[2:33:59] Divinos572: other than that no
[2:34:03] CloudPants8081: towCopium
[2:34:04] Senseixww: never
[2:34:04] IgneousLion: that just want wow to be even easier and brain dead lol
[2:34:07] BigD530: WoW on Meta Quest VR would be interesting
[2:34:07] x1mmortal_: what if they put wow classic on consoles lol
[2:34:08] mayonaes: I would run random task on console at night laying in bed. professions etc...
[2:34:10] Aidler: WoW on the Vision Pro LUL
[2:34:12] plddn: I already play with no addons but ehh
[2:34:12] Shugaze: wow classic plays great on rog ally with controller, retail thats another thing
[2:34:12] ijuki: I mean, if you have a family a console can be nice
[2:34:13] Gelomorte: I am not pushing it but it would be nice for relaxing farming content
[2:34:15] whatitdo1738: they probably bring it up because console people being in group will suck?
[2:34:15] warrenny: People are stupid
[2:34:15] TweektheProphet: the question is how many new people would adding wow to console MS would only add if they thought they could increase the sub numbers @Towelliee
[2:34:17] flebbooo: At most i'dd just farm mounts and do basic stuff on the couch late night
[2:34:17] mizthebot: did you quit hardcore?
[2:34:20] Sollice: @Towelliee I think I would for some activities, light questing, town work, trading etc etc. Not for raiding or dungeons. But is it worth development time for that little?
[2:34:27] dannyis1337: ESO came out on console later, wasnt a console game at launch
[2:34:27] lawles_walrus: Personally that sounds nice, just laying in bed chillin
[2:34:30] mavericks312: if i can see your on console and no addons super declined/ignored
[2:34:41] CoolioDoom: lol heck no, no addons..., how the heck would you play  each class, like what 8 button on a pad madness..., mouse keyboard all the way.
[2:34:45] 91Niki: @Sollice Yeah, I can see that too. Casual leveling and stuff. But actually playing playing, nah
[2:34:47] MsAriez: as much as I hate alli, I would picked a alli POC gamer before a horde console
[2:34:50] DatacronGuide: I feel like streamer interaction would fall nearly off the map if everyone went to console. Streamers wouldn't like that at all. Not to mention the lack of customizability.
[2:34:51] Pallyofhell: give us the ability to remove crossplay like D4 did
[2:34:52] Finiin: When FF14 came out on console the same thing happened
[2:34:57] kokochris: "running XYZ, FAST FAST ONLY... No Console, No Controller..."
[2:34:57] Biggins_Prime: +16 No Console...I can see it now
[2:35:10] MoonwalkingAngel: you only need a current 500 dollar pc to run wow if you wanne play wow so bad
[2:35:11] IgneousLion: @dannyis1337 get your facst right console release was planned during development and came out the same year as it did on pc try again
[2:35:22] iamspacemanspiff: iamspacemanspiff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Morning Towellie
[2:35:23] Ponas91: wish they would
[2:35:23] Eviltuna13: I would play it on console if I can use a mouse and keyboard because I can take it when I travel
[2:35:25] im_capy: "block console players from joining your group" option would be a huge hit
[2:35:28] MsAriez: if they removed add they would lose so many players/sub
[2:35:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the biggest issue is that patches for games on console have to go through an annoying process; it can lead to a game having two versions of updates
[2:35:37] plddn: I doubt consoles could handle it I can’t even dragon fly without lagging every microzone load
[2:35:37] Shugaze: could be fine if consoles has their own server
[2:35:41] yepclocc: gamepass would bring ms more value
[2:35:42] TheGiant99: You can still have a sub to play on console
[2:35:43] Kelticlore: If the money was worth it yes
[2:35:45] lawles_walrus: being in bed lol
[2:35:58] mavericks312: @yepclocc it would not
[2:35:58] ijuki: "fine" is a stretch, but runs yes
[2:36:00] im_capy: Steam Deck can run warcraft
[2:36:06] strike879: thats called a laptop
[2:36:08] bigbadkenny93: It's a possible untapped market to try an port wow to console. Especially with Microsoft acquiring them, I see it coming out inevitably at this point. How would it work? who knows, I just wanna see it lol
[2:36:10] TweektheProphet: will it increase the sub base it the big questions, at the end of the day it all about $
[2:36:10] CloudPants8081: Gamepass means it will be on GeForce now
[2:36:12] Ponas91: Playing on PS5 is cheaper than on pc
[2:36:17] supernerdcallme2fast4u: consle palyers are better ten bots
[2:36:18] AstridLory: you could run wow on a laptop
[2:36:18] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[2:36:20] Valseki: At the same time, there are console only gamers that blizzard makes no money off of with WoW
[2:36:22] Shugaze: or console only servers I guess
[2:36:22] brazkat: im 100% blocking console players personally
[2:36:24] abracka_: wE waNT woW on CONsolEs and then 300 people use their xbox to play wow after THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF DEV TIME WAS POURED INTO IT
[2:36:25] dannyis1337: @IgneousLion get your fact straight lol ESO came out April 2014 and console was June 2015
[2:36:26] abracka_: STOP
[2:36:26] mavericks312: also how bout them phillies back in the playoffs again red october is here
[2:36:34] Aserak: hi towelliee, hi chat
[2:36:36] yepclocc: @mavericks312 it would. microsoft would be happier to have a bunch of people on their gamepass than whatever wow tokens make
[2:36:40] Tooyoo: I don't think you need to block or categorize console players. If they aren't good enoughu players their score would reflect it. It's not like PC players are all 3000 RIO
[2:36:43] 91Niki: @Ponas91 Absolutely not true. Like he just said, you can get the biggest budget PC and it will run wow just fine
[2:36:44] mavericks312: console players get the instablock
[2:36:46] 91Niki: Or laptop even
[2:36:49] Sylphy_TV: D:
[2:36:52] MoonwalkingAngel: eso only has 5 buttons
[2:36:55] im_capy: LFR is the only content they would get to do LUL
[2:36:56] TheGiant99: Console and pc players play together in FF
[2:36:59] CloudPants8081: Aim assist inc Kappa
[2:37:01] Tooyoo: We already have a rating system to block "bad players" and if console players fall in that category, then their scores will reflect that
[2:37:01] mavericks312: @yepclocc wow token makes more per year then gampass
[2:37:04] Finiin: As a mostly console player, I wouldn't want to play with console players
[2:37:07] bigbadkenny93: 100% console would have to only be console. PC players would not stand for that bs for the majority lol
[2:37:21] mavericks312: @TheGiant99 yea but FF ddoesnt have addons
[2:37:23] dright424: they already added auto tab target
[2:37:29] im_capy: Id rather have bots in my group tbh
[2:37:31] Spotmonk: The consoleport addon is pretty close to what an official version would be, I think
[2:37:45] Shugaze: id play classic wow console if they got their own server no crossplay
[2:37:52] tonyr23: I'd do console for questing that's it
[2:37:52] Valseki: No, when I mention consoles, I wouldn't switch, but you ignore the people that don't own gaming PCs
[2:37:52] supernerdcallme2fast4u: @dright424 wth is auto tab
[2:37:52] FALSEsentiment: Why not both with crossplay?
[2:37:53] yepclocc: @mavericks312 gamepass has like 30 million subscribers. what are you on about
[2:37:54] Senseixww: theyre delusional i swear
[2:37:55] tylive52: time to do some classic leveling
[2:37:57] Kelticlore: World First becomes consoul vs pc lol
[2:37:59] TheGiant99: Why the console hate though
[2:38:02] Valseki: Its about getting new people, not converting other people
[2:38:03] Tooyoo: People acting like there aren't players that can't even do +10's on PC.
[2:38:16] 91Niki: You don't need a gaming PC to play wow tho lol
[2:38:16] BMiller270: Morning!
[2:38:19] Aserak: Towelliee/Chat, what do you think about adding a Scroll of Resurrection to the end boss of the 40 man raids in HC? It could have a 24 hour timer before it expires so that it couldnt be stock piled. I think it would be great for drama.
[2:38:19] DatacronGuide: 100% streamers would suffer the most. Nevermind everything else. Streamer interaction would fall if that became popular. Fact.
[2:38:20] abracka_: @91Niki https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/Mhwrxr/entry-level-intel-gaming-build here is literally a $583 dollar gaming PC that will run wow
[2:38:20] Ponas91: @91Niki The PS5 costs 499$
[2:38:28] mavericks312: @TheGiant99 because console players wouldnt have addons and would 100% get instablocked
[2:38:32] im_capy: isnt console gaming the minority on Twitch? feels it
[2:38:37] plddn: Weak auras makes me turn /say off in a30m raid
[2:38:38] yepclocc: they're thinking of potential new players that are strictly on console that might want to try wow if theres a console version available. new blood
[2:38:39] Tooyoo: Yeah, but it is about gaining new players, not converting current players to consle.
[2:38:40] dright424: @dright424 I believe its called like action targeting, it targets mobs based on where your camera is facing
[2:38:40] 91Niki: @Ponas91 Yeah and you can by a pc or laptop for less ROFL
[2:38:43] Valseki: sorry - I was just trying to join the convo about possible future plans
[2:38:46] laeenaravenholdt: lol my pc took a shit, so I'm just not gaming right now. RIP
[2:38:48] Valseki: my bad lol
[2:38:49] strike879: WoW is the new Doom of it runs on everything
[2:38:50] pk99: by today's rtx standard my old pc is not a gamer anymore
[2:38:53] mavericks312: mobile gaming is in the lead then console
[2:38:56] Pallyofhell: PS5 still cheaper than a cheap PC that can run wow
[2:38:57] Animalfitz: u can buy a marketplace used pc that runs wow for 200 bucks lol
[2:39:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Consoles sell, there are a lot of them out there
[2:39:06] Frostdzzt: who needs a gaming pc for wow, you can build a 400$ system, which is the same cost as a console, and still run Wow. Hell I still paly with a 960, and it runs just fine.
[2:39:10] lawles_walrus: Ok but wow is not super intrusive to a PC, so a "gaming PC isn't needed"
[2:39:10] zeeAbe: Mobile is bigger than PC + Console combined tho LUL
[2:39:18] TweektheProphet: so we are saying wow on mobile is coming then lol
[2:39:21] ijuki: @Animalfitz lol @ marketplace
[2:39:22] Tooyoo: I don't think any PC-WoW players will swap to console. But there are probably players out there that don't play WoW, but would try it out if it was on console.
[2:39:25] IgneousLion: @Pallyofhell you just saying dumb stuff to say it now
[2:39:31] 91Niki: @Pallyofhell Not true
[2:39:32] snake_like: "runs" wow is different than "plays" wow
[2:39:36] kokochris: its by far the most accessible market
[2:39:36] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:39:45] Alsparq: Nope
[2:39:45] Animalfitz: no
[2:39:47] Animalfitz: lol
[2:39:47] Alsparq: Easy
[2:39:51] Gelomorte: I would play it in addition to
[2:39:56] mavericks312: @Tooyoo cool but those players would get ignored from doing anything like dungeons raids and what not
[2:39:57] dannyis1337: I would do both tbh and farm while in bed lol
[2:39:58] Pallyofhell: running=/= playing wow
[2:40:01] CloudPants8081: Mike did it? Kappa
[2:40:02] JavLive: I think its about acquiring new players. not migrating current
[2:40:05] plddn: Details should be built in already
[2:40:09] Aserak: they would have to simplify the classes to be on consoles.
[2:40:14] yepclocc: wow being on console would help bring in new blood - ie people that play only on consoles. its not about existing players necessarily
[2:40:15] Pharaoh_326: i would try it but i would still stick to pc
[2:40:17] Tooyoo: @mavericks312 how is that any different than 1000 RIO players?
[2:40:21] Xian359: Offline single player console version when they discontinue the pc version
[2:40:24] Tooyoo: @mavericks312 there are bad PC players too
[2:40:27] Shugaze: TERA had console only servers, wow can do that same
[2:40:28] mavericks312: also new gamers arent gonna try WoW when they play fps's all day
[2:40:29] im_capy: same people complain why less dev time is put into the game
[2:40:31] Valestrus: for no reason? increased number of players will have access to the game sureky?>
[2:40:33] SerinaPendragon: I would do non-raid content occasionally on console, but wouldn’t trade PC for console permanently
[2:40:33] BigD530: there's only 1 thing in WoW that i'd use a controller on....Dragonriding
[2:40:36] TheGiant99: Shouldn't need add-ons to play the game
[2:40:58] im_capy: You dont need addons to play
[2:40:58] Senseixww: no
[2:41:01] JaeDee: NO CONSOLE PLAYERS ALLOWED
[2:41:01] Shugaze: That if you assume there will be crossplatform enabled
[2:41:03] JaeDee: Lmao
[2:41:03] im_capy: QoL
[2:41:08] mavericks312: @Tooyoo here is the difference if someone can see your on console you get ignored atleast with players now they look to see if you have atleast done the content
[2:41:11] xRykku: Its like FF14 PC vs console FF14
[2:41:13] abracka_: hi youtube
[2:41:14] Pharaoh_326: the community isnt friendly to new players either so its going to be very harsh for console players
[2:41:14] TheRiwen: I think they will
[2:41:18] xRykku: PC players still ahve the advantage
[2:41:20] KiuB69: who says addons cant be a thing on consoles?
[2:41:23] Alsparq: blizzard would if the money was there but I doubt it is
[2:41:30] MorteaWolf17: like eso
[2:41:31] Shugaze: I could see that lmao
[2:41:34] bygodwest: Once they go F2P they’ll go console
[2:41:35] 91Niki: ROFL
[2:41:37] tdizziie: What a take lol
[2:41:37] Hammerpain: i think a whole new WoW based type  game on console would be cool
[2:41:41] Shugaze: that would be sick
[2:41:42] mavericks312: lmao how many console players do you think there will actually be lol
[2:41:42] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:41:45] SphinxyOCE: LUL
[2:41:48] 91Niki: That's the hottest take I have seen today KEKW
[2:41:48] TheGiant99: It isn't all about the race
[2:41:55] Tooyoo: @mavericks312 THere already is a rating system in game. There are ppl on PC that play without a mouse, but I don't care if their raider IO score is high enough.
[2:42:07] zeeAbe: Ghost Gaming about to transfer to Console WoW to compete in the RWF, heard it here first FOLKS
[2:42:08] Tooyoo: What hardware they use doesnt matter, just their rating matters.
[2:42:13] Shugaze: Id love it tbh
[2:42:14] mavericks312: bro fuck chris metzen all to hell lol
[2:42:15] lawles_walrus: WTF WHAT hahahah
[2:42:17] 91Niki: "Where the fuck is all the people?? Wow really is fucking dead" *console players in major cities* KEKW
[2:42:20] lawles_walrus: no way they don't cross
[2:42:20] Pharaoh_326: in todays day and age theres now way it wouldnt be cross platform lol
[2:42:24] theszoti: what if only classic comes to consoles?
[2:42:41] mavericks312: WoW on console would actually be dead dead
[2:42:42] MsAriez: if blizzard did a stand alone wow that's not PC it woul dbe moblie and not console
[2:42:50] Shugaze: classic plays wonderful on ROG Ally
[2:42:53] Effin_Steffin: Touchpad gonna go to Controllerwarrior
[2:42:53] 91Niki: Yeah classic you can EASILY play with a controller
[2:42:56] hirosan84: hirosan84 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 1 year
[2:43:11] BMiller270: What WA do you use for your mouse circle highlight?
[2:43:12] Alsparq: too many controls for console
[2:43:18] Tooyoo: I mean there are tons of PC players that don't even mouse look and click on abilities still.
[2:43:25] Fudian1: Ff14 does it
[2:43:33] JLmorten: JLmorten subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months, currently on a 88 month streak! 
[2:43:36] im_capy: Classic+ really just gonna be Classic on console LUL

[2:43:40] SonofHorus82: I could get an adapter and hook up an old SNES controller up and play classic paladin with no issues.
[2:43:40] greywind317: Do Ret pallys get raid spots in hardcore classic?
[2:43:46] sandychicken2: Console does have keyboard and mouse support
[2:43:48] dannyis1337: maybe they will make it so you can only play hunter or Demon hunter on console Kappa
[2:43:50] Purgatan: Mythic plus natty with a controller sounds like nightmare fuel
[2:43:50] Pallyofhell: @greywind317 no
[2:43:51] Effin_Steffin: @Tooyoo WOW! I feel attacked!
[2:43:53] Gingerprimer: @Fudian1 yes a mmo designed with consoles in mind from the start
[2:43:55] 91Niki: Right, cuz that is another thing. You then need to pour money into a team that can dedicate themselves to porting the game to console. That cost money
[2:43:57] Pharaoh_326: prob be like FF14 where you have to buy the game again to play your account on the console.
[2:44:03] Shugaze: Classic FRESH on console only servers, Im so down
[2:44:05] TweektheProphet: Since consoles can do keyboard and mouse they could do a must use, it would set a precedent but they could do it
[2:44:07] Drizz_36: @greywind317 unless you are the GM its pretty unlikely
[2:44:12] mavericks312: we need blizzcon to get here fast
[2:44:13] ravenwingz0405: Where are the healers, imagine trying to heal with a controller? idk who that would happen
[2:44:31] Tooyoo: @Effin_Steffin and you prob. still play better than other PC players :)
[2:44:33] greywind317: @pallyofhell Ty bro I didn’t know
[2:44:34] Thoreya: think they should have console players only play with console players for a bit, it would be very toxic for those thatve been used to playing with a keyboard for 20 years
[2:44:42] Masqerader: if WOW was on console ain't none of those kids getting invited to content, you got dbm? no? decline
[2:44:49] Pharaoh_326: 30 min left on maintenance'
[2:44:58] smashwow: jak played auggie with a controller
[2:44:59] mavericks312: where is my heal at oh sorry my controller died
[2:45:06] 91Niki: @mavericks312 LUL
[2:45:13] hirosan84: Controller is
[2:45:17] Shugaze: knowing everyone in your BRD group uses controller is kinda cool LUL
[2:45:21] Masqerader: you could play DKs in wrath that way
[2:45:22] omegablue267: I'm pretty sure most if not all consoles you can use mouse and keyboard tho
[2:45:36] mavericks312: @91Niki you know that will happen lol
[2:45:38] Skizzurp: theres no way you would ever have enough button or button combinations for a controller to play wow
[2:45:49] mavericks312: MS is gonna just leave them alone an let them continue to print money
[2:45:52] yepclocc: for sure phil spencer will be at blizzcon
[2:45:53] greywind317: @drizz_36 Ty bro
[2:45:54] Pallyofhell: @Skizzurp you can with classic wow
[2:45:56] Masqerader: they don't need WOW on console they will make a shit ton from the mobile games + COD
[2:45:57] CloudPants8081: With the Xbox Adaptive Controller would be cool tho towKek
[2:46:01] plddn: I like the debate but I’d never play console  no addons is where I’m at tho  playing on a macro pad and mouse
[2:46:11] unowncreature: They would of already put it on console if they were ever going to. Because putting it on console purely for xbox would not be worth the money spent in doing it.
[2:46:12] DrkPhoenix6913: @yepclocc 100%
[2:46:19] Sicknessqt: Give bigger budget and resources maybe
[2:46:19] kokochris: yup
[2:46:20] mavericks312: @yepclocc depends if the deal is closed byt hen
[2:46:21] Shugaze: KING
[2:46:24] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Hey! Actually have had that happen, but with someone's mouse LUL Hence why I refuse to buy a mouse that is rechargeable. Good old AAA batteries last forever SeemsGood
[2:46:27] segarth: King dude
[2:46:28] abracka_: candy crush BABBYYYYYY
[2:46:30] Gelomorte: We wont see too much for probably 5 ish years
[2:46:32] mavericks312: i think they actually wanted king above everything

[2:46:43] hirosan84: Controller I'd be down for playing wow on that way I could sit on the couch the way a video game is supposed to be played
[2:46:50] mavericks312: candy crush actually makes more money then all of them
[2:46:51] im_capy: Warcraft is the marketing of BLizz basically
[2:46:57] yepclocc: didnt d4 sell like crazy?
[2:46:59] signeddudu: Heroes of Xbox coming: Thrall vs Halo xD
[2:47:00] segarth: They wanted Heroes of the Storm dude. Big money
[2:47:06] Tooyoo: @hirosan84 you can right now. Controllers work in WoW
[2:47:11] Shugaze: Master Chief transmog when?
[2:47:12] aladinsane444: False. All they want is The Lost Vikings IP
[2:47:12] dr_bob_gaming: I can see that they will add more developers to it.
[2:47:20] deestreezy: D4 bad
[2:47:21] CloudPants8081: towKek
[2:47:23] Masqerader: they want bethesda for Starfield and the only thing they can say "10 million players"  ya but how many copies did u sell? they won't reveal it because it was infalted by gamepass
[2:47:33] Romnus: cant wait for shadowlands classic Kappa
[2:47:33] WickedNastyGaming: @Towelliee I keep hearing Classic Plus?? What does that actually mean, and maybe I am thinking too deep on it
[2:47:35] sandychicken2: Fallout 4 had mods on Xbox so blizz could do the same thing
[2:47:35] Masqerader: *inflated
[2:47:38] Xerevil: realm selection tab is up
[2:47:54] strike879: if you want to play controller there are pc compatible ones no need for a console port
[2:48:00] yepclocc: @mavericks312 deadline is 18th of oct, if deal is not closed by then then its dead. decision by CMA is coming out on the 6th i think
[2:48:06] Masqerader: moving  at 3fps
[2:48:07] syla90: 90% of players don't use binds anyway so using a controller wouldnt make such a difference for them
[2:48:09] warrenny: Halo cod crossober Kappa
[2:48:12] im_capy: consoles would crash all the time
[2:48:13] SphinxyOCE: imagine trying to set that shit up on console. fuck it would be a nightmare
[2:48:13] mavericks312: @Masqerader an when you ask to see actual sales numbers ppl jump down your throat
[2:48:18] Valseki: @Masqerader They are going to make all their money from DLC with Starfield - that was always the plan
[2:48:21] Skizzurp: you wouldnt
[2:48:23] Tooyoo: @syla90 exactly
[2:48:24] TheGiant99: Alot of add-ons are not really needed
[2:48:24] Pallyofhell: @WickedNastyGaming its an idea the classic community has up their ass about adding new content to classic
[2:48:25] Shugaze: on 4K tv LUL my eyes would die
[2:48:27] mavericks312: @yepclocc they could extend the date again
[2:48:30] 91Niki: TLDR; you don't
[2:48:38] brazkat: or addons not wanting to work and needs reloaded
[2:48:39] Tooyoo: Everyone acting like all console players have to mythic raid or push M+ 25s
[2:48:41] bearlicioussss: !PRIME PET

[2:48:59] Effin_Steffin: i thought Classic players didnt want changes?
[2:49:04] dr_bob_gaming: Keyboard.
[2:49:05] Shugaze: wow classic on console would be pretty comfy honestly, retail just forget about it
[2:49:07] fewyn: that's the fun part you don't!
[2:49:14] brazkat: silver dragon i think would cause a console to crash
[2:49:15] mavericks312: @Tooyoo your sitting here thinking regular mythic runners would even invite console players without addons
[2:49:15] Phil87z: That’s why 14 doesn’t have adding
[2:49:17] Valseki: @Tooyoo Nope - everyone that plays WoW min-maxes and uses addons - e v e r y o n e
[2:49:18] Drizz_36: @Effin_Steffin that was only for vanilla. now basically anything is on the table
[2:49:22] sandychicken2: Ya keyboard and mise
[2:49:23] Phil87z: Add ons
[2:49:25] sandychicken2: Mouse
[2:49:26] im_capy: Pet Battles becomes the premier content for console players
[2:49:45] Skizzurp: theres even more buttons that you use on classic with all the engineering items and potions etc
[2:49:45] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:49:50] Tooyoo: @Valseki o_O? sarcasm i hope. I know tons of players that refuse to use addons in retail. LUL
[2:49:52] TheGiant99: Not every player min/maxs
[2:49:54] iamspacemanspiff: Hunters coun't  rename thier pets
[2:49:59] mavericks312: Hazel would be all over that for sure
[2:50:00] syla90: imagine doing a Legion Tower on console
[2:50:05] Turco11: yeah Blizz could just be like here ya go straight port to xbox,,,, bring your own keyboard and mouse
[2:50:12] Masqerader: no questie on console or zygor.. trying to figure out where to go when u don't text chat
[2:50:24] Tooyoo: @mavericks312 I dont even care what players use as long as they are good enough. I know TONS of players in mythic raids that are horrible at the game and have horrendous control setups.
[2:50:32] Shugaze: @Masqerader the way it was meant to be played!
[2:50:37] Valseki: @Tooyoo Yea - 100% lol - I mentioned the idea of WoW going to consoles and I am not a console-only-user that hates PC
[2:50:42] Tooyoo: Just b/c you are a PC player doesn't mean yo uare automatically good at the game.
[2:50:44] Valseki: now*
[2:50:46] utopin: classic would be perfect for console 1 and 2 button rotations
[2:51:00] Romnus: im super casual and have details and dbm and bagnon
[2:51:07] plddn: You could macro ability’s into 3button strings or hold l1+l2 ab ext to make up to 30 ish probably but I have like 48 key binds on some toons
[2:51:10] tszord: Hc on console. When you die, so does your system.
[2:51:17] Ezcotli: I use a gaming keypad and mmo mouse for wow
[2:51:20] mavericks312: @Tooyoo again if i can see your on console i instantly know you dont have addons and your a handicap already why would i invite you
[2:51:20] warrenny: @syla90 impossible
[2:51:25] humanbehindcomputer: i think releasing the game on console will give wow a big boost
[2:51:29] Shugaze: classic on console with proximity voice chat jokrdKEKW
[2:51:34] Masqerader: @Shugaze if that was the case they wouldn't allow addons
[2:51:37] Valseki: @plddn that's what FFXIV does
[2:51:39] Sicknessqt: KEKW
[2:51:41] unowncreature: The game update time would be miserable on console.
[2:51:47] TheGiant99: But how does anyone really know. It could work just as easy as ff
[2:51:53] mavericks312: this man is trying to use the contra code to cast frostbolt
[2:51:54] WickedNastyGaming: lol right
[2:51:56] Sicknessqt: Gonna be playing wow like mortal kombat LUL
[2:52:00] Tooyoo: @mavericks312 I mean that's on you. But as long as they can do their job, i don't care what they are using or how they do it.
[2:52:08] Masqerader: sir you use a 12 button mouse, who u fooling with keyboard :P
[2:52:09] Frank4LuLz: fukk that
[2:52:11] mavericks312: @TheGiant99 wrong FF was designed for console
[2:52:11] WickedNastyGaming: No way I would want to setup a controller configuration for WoW ...Nope , Notta no thanks
[2:52:15] plddn: Yup the skill level and brain cap would be huge
[2:52:22] Valseki: But FFXIV does that
[2:52:24] JimKappa420: You can make all in one macro with addon that can save you alot keybinds
[2:52:28] tonyr23: Mortal Kombat WoW
[2:52:30] utopin: rank 1 DH dps phrase in Battle of Dazar'alor on mythic was using a controller
[2:52:30] valianya: MS comes out with a keyboard and mouse for console
[2:52:32] mavericks312: @Tooyoo thats not just me that would be about 90% of the WoW community
[2:52:38] Shugaze: On portable PC I do, play on the sofa/bed
[2:52:40] Masqerader: @Valseki because ff14 was built around that
[2:52:40] finnstigatrr: simon says lol
[2:52:41] TheGiant99: @mavericks312 ff still has a shit ton of buttons also
[2:52:44] medanmarko: Does a PS5/Xbox support a keyboard or something similar? Can you connect a periferal like that to them?
[2:52:48] mavericks312: @Valseki but FF was built for console stop it
[2:52:49] WickedNastyGaming: this all goes back to even games like Call of Duty...stop all this helping console peeps and people just need to choose their weapon of choice
[2:52:54] Skizzurp: they would have to have separate servers for console theres no way any console player would be able to compete on same servers as keyboard/mice players
[2:52:57] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee  PPL are also way overestatming how many console only ppl would 1. Buy wow expansion 2. Keep buying game time
[2:53:17] humanbehindcomputer: there already some addons for controller support , and bunch of other mmo on console use controller
[2:53:20] iamspacemanspiff: Wonder if any one has used rewads to use a contreoller with wow
[2:53:22] Absolute1790: ConsolePort works nice on the steam deck though, but definitely not usable for raiding or m+
[2:53:22] delavor1: i q'ed into a eye of azshara random dungeon while leveling, ppl could not figure out Serpentes and left KEKW
[2:53:36] Shugaze: wow on controller does feel like Bop It sometimes
[2:53:40] RetroRoBo: FF does fine with console/computer players
[2:54:02] Pallyofhell: FF had console in mind when the game was being made
[2:54:07] warrenny: Plug keyboard into console Kappa
[2:54:08] mavericks312: @RetroRoBo because it was built for consoles
[2:54:08] Valseki: nah, xbox dev kit since its basically windows
[2:54:17] WickedNastyGaming: FF has been on console since PS2
[2:54:17] segarth: Pc master race: you up wow on console but recommend using mouse and keyboard, all these console andys discover basically Pc gaming and get converted ez
[2:54:27] mavericks312: you guys keep bring up FF but it was designed for consoles
[2:54:29] unowncreature: FF14 sucks on console imo I tried it and hated it.
[2:54:36] im_capy: Maybe next version of consoles will be more tied to PCs, cloud gaming or whatever. We see Microsoft blending their worlds kinda already
[2:54:37] abracka_: y'all smoking crack if you think the majority of FF14 players don't use mods KEKW
[2:54:39] TweektheProphet: since FF1
[2:54:40] humanbehindcomputer: elder scroll online an d neverwinter are on console too
[2:54:44] Gingerprimer: FF franchise core playerbase is always on console
[2:54:44] TweektheProphet: FF11
[2:54:46] dr_bob_gaming: And besides, WOW and FF is two different games.
[2:54:54] Valseki: solid point, they can't change anything at this point
[2:55:01] RetroRoBo: Hardcore/ classic would do fine on console no? Minus addons
[2:55:11] TheGiant99: So really it's the add-ons that are the issue not the actual game itself
[2:55:15] IgneousLion: people just wanting to argue at this point
[2:55:22] IgneousLion: not even a conversation lol
[2:55:26] Skizzurp: theres no way classic uses more buttons than retail
[2:55:30] Tooyoo: I dont think "Would ppl switch" is the correct question
[2:55:35] dr_bob_gaming: I think less than 5% will switch.
[2:55:39] mavericks312: @TheGiant99 addons are part of the game though
[2:55:40] dr_bob_gaming: if that was the case.
[2:55:41] Tooyoo: I think the question is "would ppl try it out, if they are console plaeyrs that never played wow"
[2:55:42] Absolute1790: Microsoft is a big advocate for console gaming though, they even made AoE4, an rts, work on console.
[2:55:50] fewyn: i would not switch and i don't really see the overlap between Console Gamers and PC MMO players
[2:55:52] humanbehindcomputer: switch ? what about people that never played on pc lol ,  got bunch of friends that just are on console and dont play on pc
[2:55:54] mavericks312: console players would only be about 3% tops
[2:55:56] im_capy: FFIV being added to xbox next year, lets just leave it there and let WoW be WoW
[2:56:08] TheGiant99: Add-ons are a crutch
[2:56:11] im_capy: WoW PvP on a controller.....kek
[2:56:13] Pallyofhell: @Absolute1790 RTS games have been on console for decades
[2:56:15] tszord: More Mogs
[2:56:19] Valseki: it would only be xbox, which they mostly have support for since it runs on windows
[2:56:24] Turco11: blizz could just throw it out there with a disclaimer this is not preferred way to play......kinda like when a game prompts you to use a controllor
[2:56:35] R2RHIN0: It sounds miserable with all the different keybinds

[2:56:42] zenFX_: @Absolute1790 talking like rts  on console was never a thing until then lol
[2:56:46] utopin: imagine if wow is still popular in 100 years

[2:56:50] strike879: an xbox is a pc
[2:56:53] Tooyoo: @Absolute1790 yeah exactly this.
[2:57:11] mavericks312: @Absolute1790 an those players would get insta ignored by the other 97% of the playerbase
[2:57:15] Tooyoo: If anything it is a door to encourage console players to buy a PC to play it more.
[2:57:24] Redpandalol: @Towelliee have you ever thought about pushing io rating at all?
[2:57:27] unowncreature: The xbox community that would try it is not big enough for it to be profitable  to even attempt it.
[2:57:31] im_capy: I mean you build consoles by using a computer
[2:57:56] TheGiant99: @mavericks312 that's because most wow players are elitests
[2:57:57] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:58:05] Gingerprimer: Also Blizzard time is prob better spent trying to recapture the Casual audience that was lost in BFA/SL
[2:58:07] Epiclurker27893: WOW on the Switch would be interesting, raiding on the go.
[2:58:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: If Phil Spencer wants it to happen, it will. If he doesn't it won't
[2:58:20] humanbehindcomputer: According to the latest data, there are approximately 3.09 billion active video gamers worldwide   . i wonder what the % of pc , console and mobile
[2:58:28] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 Now that's not true. Are there ellitests on wow? Yes, but to say most, naah
[2:58:29] im_capy: Microsoft just trying to get into PC gaming more too. They prob capped on console stuff mostly and want to expand
[2:58:36] strike879: wow on the go is called a laptop
[2:58:36] snake_like: Make it on console for all I care, but don't try porting keybinds and controls to a controller. Just make people use a keyboard
[2:58:52] Nokterian: PS5 is a pc as well made by AMD same for Xbox Series X
[2:59:07] Pallyofhell: @TheGiant99 i wouldn't say the 1% is most players
[2:59:16] Jango_: the .01%
[2:59:20] Niksen_99: How many characters you got to 70 so far in project 70 turbulents :D
[2:59:24] cgolden1a: i mean i love the game but its just not on my ps5
[2:59:28] Frank4LuLz: free to play lol
[2:59:29] Turco11: 12 yr old kid though might sit right in front of tv and play WoW because they dont have a PC
[2:59:36] c0mmander_starscream: Console now might as well be a PC, it just has a different UI
[2:59:38] mavericks312: imagine trying to run WoW on the fucking switch
[2:59:41] TheGiant99: @91niki I would say more are then are not
[2:59:46] Tooyoo: no one would switch, but that's never been the goal of porting a game.
[2:59:46] TheWhiteYuri: @Towelliee wow should not be free to play, but should be added to the PC GAME PASS
[2:59:51] Valseki: People can also talk about a topic without being being crazy supportive of it
[2:59:57] Tooyoo: Even when they port console games to PC they dont try to get players to switch.
[3:00:01] c0mmander_starscream: No Grandpa, it's not on Atari
[3:00:07] humanbehindcomputer: but there plenty of console player that never played wow and touched a pc
[3:00:08] Nokterian: you can play WoW on Steam Deck
[3:00:13] im_capy: Rumble might have trouble running on that thing LUL
[3:00:15] Tooyoo: They go into a new market to reach new untapped plaeyrs.
[3:00:18] Jango_: portable wow would atleast be something
[3:00:20] Finiin: MK 1 Switch lol
[3:00:23] 91Niki: @TheGiant99 Nah, just because they are loud, doesn't make most of them. People who have something negative to say will always be the loudest. Just the way that works. Doesn't mean there is more of them
[3:00:24] Gingerprimer: No I mean that Blizzard time is prob better spent trying to regain their lost player rather than ppls idea of chasing some  mythical wow console player
[3:00:28] Tooyoo: Not to switch PC plaeyrs to console or vice versa.
[3:00:33] unowncreature: It would melt the poor thing. Switch can't even run minecraft well.
[3:00:33] Tabb03: havent played wow in awhile, was thinking about going to classic
[3:00:40] c0mmander_starscream: WoW on Switch Confirmed!
[3:00:41] Masqerader: the reality is: People assume just because MS bought Activision/Blizzard that everything is gonna be put on gamepass and xbox and that shit won't happen.  They wanted Activision Blizzard for COD and the Mobile shit
[3:00:44] cta62: @Towelliee ehy your pc laggin?
[3:00:49] segarth: Casual Wow players don’t press 80% of their abilities, controlled is more than enough KEKW
[3:01:10] Jango_: minecraft can be a resource hog
[3:01:13] flebbooo: Switch 2 launch title should be wow
[3:01:14] wellborn: Honestly, for me...I'm just bored. There isn't a good, new mmorpg out and hasn't been for a long time.
[3:01:14] im_capy: Look at the difference on Switch with the new Mortal Kombat game graphics, its wicked bad
[3:01:16] Nokterian: your game is a bit lagging
[3:01:20] Alsparq: console does not offer a new market
[3:01:25] Masqerader: oh
[3:01:29] Masqerader: those framedrops
[3:01:33] cta62: @Towelliee your game is lagging for us ya clown
[3:01:34] c0mmander_starscream: @Masqerader Winner, winnner chicken dinner CoD. Captain Price is back

[3:01:43] Pallyofhell: there is some frame drops
[3:01:52] Starryskys: Keep seeing a stutter
[3:01:56] snake_like: eh, Doom Eternal runs like a miracle on Switch. MK1 is a bad example because of their poor implementation
[3:01:57] plddn: I lag so bad in dragon racing I got Starlink to test if it’s any better lol we’ll see tonight I’m out work style
[3:01:58] Nokterian: yeah frame drops here and there
[3:01:59] Tabb03: mines fine
[3:02:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't see any lag, he might need to refresh
[3:02:03] Pallyofhell: its a random stutter here and there
[3:02:04] Nehcrom: Thought it was my web browser.
[3:02:05] Starryskys: It was like that earlier
[3:02:05] unowncreature: Not lagging for me
[3:02:06] Masqerader: might be twitch

[3:02:17] cabalish: eu is fine here
[3:02:21] Aussie_Kanga: looks fine to me
[3:02:25] Masqerader: it might have just been that one fight
[3:02:27] tonyr23: Tell these guys to get a better phone plan
[3:02:27] SonofHorus82: no issues here
[3:02:28] Pallyofhell: it was just that fight
[3:02:32] warrenny: Fine here
[3:02:50] Burnie1860: looks fine to me
[3:02:54] TheGiant99: Is there something that's says if a player is on steam deck or not
[3:02:58] GorSTL: previous fight had some stutter. Probably twitch
[3:03:03] Bigmann109: fine here
[3:03:18] Masqerader: the fight with the phoenix boss u had some hard drops
[3:03:33] Tooyoo: @TheGiant99 nope. Currently no way to tell if a player is using a controller in WoW.
[3:04:00] zeeAbe: Are we gonna cook up a new PTR build tonight?
[3:04:15] Drizz_36: maybe im a doomer but i don't think much of anything is going to change with metzen on board
[3:04:18] utopin: yeah split so much man
[3:04:21] Pallyofhell: im ready for the classic community tears when theres no classic+
[3:04:27] mavericks312: classic,classic+,HC,retail
[3:04:30] is__nova: Hardly anyone is playing Classic Era though
[3:04:32] flebbooo: WAYTOODANK
[3:04:33] Sylphy_TV: There are already 3 why not 4 or 5 even LUL
[3:04:34] is__nova: HC is a fad
[3:04:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: 4 versions EZ
[3:04:38] is__nova: (mostly)
[3:04:54] Masqerader: doggo
[3:05:00] FireEmblemLord: doog
[3:05:07] stallowned: towOny towOny towOny ony <3
[3:05:09] warrenny: Classic + replaces wrath
[3:05:10] Valseki: I just want progression servers with high XP rate
[3:05:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Classic, Classic+, Wrath (Cata), and retail
[3:05:35] mavericks312: no cool shit basically
[3:05:37] Darwoo: turtle wow does vanilla+ well
[3:05:43] Valseki: no chance classic+ is anything like that lol
[3:05:58] Drizz_36: if they add wrath era servers that's 5 versions total assuming there's a "classic+"
[3:05:58] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:06:06] Gian_Cena: what about wtlk+ @Towelliee
[3:06:08] Pallyofhell: ppl keep saying turtle wow does it well means blizzard will do it
[3:06:09] dyslexican1: This two storylines of wow is the weirdest copium i have heard ina LONG time!
[3:06:11] flebbooo: U think they'll keep wotlk era servers on top of cata?
[3:06:21] Jango_: i would believe more that classic + happens before a cata classic
[3:06:33] Pallyofhell: not a chance
[3:06:44] Pallyofhell: they will do cata classic before classic+
[3:06:59] Ezcotli: Hardcore retail Kappa
[3:07:03] UtherBrexton: wow 1.5: electric boogaloo
[3:07:09] dyslexican1: Classic plus is clearly classic with some quality of life stuff. The idea that they will make whole new story for it is crazy talk.
[3:07:19] Jango_: hell yeah
[3:07:27] Darwoo: just bring out wow 2:0 at this point
[3:07:34] Jango_: cata with the old talent system
[3:07:46] Pallyofhell: i liked cata talent system
[3:07:52] DunzoCD: id try it out then, combat felt better in cata than classic
[3:07:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could add stories, quests, and even other dungeons and raids to Classic, in theory
[3:07:59] utopin: new raids would be nice tho
[3:08:01] Pallyofhell: talent system from MoP and beyond was awful
[3:08:05] Vesidian: wow - the multiverse
[3:08:11] flebbooo: buuuut, bronze magic
[3:08:17] Darwoo: @wEiRdO_dUdE turtle wow have new raids and shit
[3:08:51] DunzoCD: we just get a toy that takes us back LUL
[3:09:01] UtherBrexton: the diablo 2 treatment
[3:09:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: That would be impressive, if Classic+ is a part of retail
[3:09:04] Sylphy_TV: Classic: DoodleDruids
[3:09:14] Valseki: Didn't they switch the classic client to the new client?
[3:09:20] dyslexican1: @wEiRdO_dUdE But why? What is the upside to that? there is no money in it and they are spending money to do it. It makes NO SENSE.
[3:09:22] finnstigatrr: I enjoy wow classic and hardcore, it's cool to have. I'm just more interested in retail and where the story goes. New stuff, not re-hashing the old

[3:10:23] Valseki: @flebbo_ that's technically impressive - coming from the programming side of things
[3:10:37] DunzoCD: will classic plus have flying mounts though? cuz classic andys hate flying mounts LUL
[3:10:42] Sh4nti: Did Towelliee talk about Metzen coming back yet?
[3:10:53] Pallyofhell: @Sh4nti nope Kappa
[3:10:56] dyslexican1: @wEiRdO_dUdE And there is no money in it. Now your talking about a second Dev team, making quests and stories and expansion ect... with no extra money. No company on earth would do that.
[3:11:06] flebbooo: @Valseki it is, a lot of graphical and ui stuff
[3:11:12] Sh4nti: Green Jesus is back baby! XD
[3:11:15] syla90: i know its a unpopular opinion, but im getting annyoed by this recyling thing.. just make wow 2.0 .. whats in the past, is in the past and stays in the past
[3:11:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: @dyslexican1 There is money in it if it keeps people subscribed
[3:11:28] Thoreya: 2 days of metzen news and im already over it LUL
[3:11:29] mavericks312: the metzen news is pure aids lol
[3:11:31] Drizz_36: just cancel retail 4Head
[3:11:37] Masqerader: he's gonna show up at blizzcon do that fake faction reaction "where my horde at"
[3:11:37] brazkat: id love a wow 2.0
[3:11:47] Valseki: @syla90 EQ2 says hi
[3:11:53] Pallyofhell: cata was wow 2.0
[3:12:11] dyslexican1: @wEiRdO_dUdE Thats some good copium you are on. IDK where you get it but more power to you.
[3:12:26] EKS90_: @syla90 OSRS and EQ2 are wildy popular, classic+ would be a good move TBH
[3:12:29] Ezcotli: Ogres and nagas new races
[3:12:33] UtherBrexton: hopium
[3:12:47] mavericks312: post blizcon is gonna be hella toxic
[3:12:55] itscityboy: i'd play classic+ no question.
[3:13:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: @dyslexican1 LUL
[3:13:03] Drizz_36: yeah i dont expect anything crazy at blizzcon, only a new wow expansion and classic cataclysm which is fine
[3:13:06] Masqerader: I believe they called that WOD
[3:13:07] Jango_: 100%
[3:13:10] TheGiant99: End of the day it's just a video game
[3:13:15] Pallyofhell: i used to hate seeing ppl get their hopes up after years of the classic community rant about classic+ i fucking get excited seeing their hopes get crushed
[3:13:25] frenzoll: We saw what Sylvanas thought about hope 😂🔥
[3:13:29] indiegarona: I agree - that would have been a HUGE reveal at Blizzcon.
[3:13:31] supernerdcallme2fast4u: it does suck to see the potential of wow then we get a phone game lil dragon flight
[3:13:44] Drakmord: good idea
[3:13:51] syla90: lets say they create classic+ .. but its blizzard, mark my words, they will screw this up and reddit will be full of crying people how classic+ is not what community wanted @eks90_ ergo recycling is a bad thing
[3:13:55] Thoreya: what makes DF a phone game?
[3:14:01] Masqerader: do it at blizzcon like when your favorite wrestler returns

[3:14:05] Sh4nti: People are expecting Classic+ reveal for Blizzcon now KEKW
[3:14:06] flebbooo: And then Chirs Metzen can yell some For the horde/alliance! and we're all happy :)
[3:14:10] Scoodles91: ooor maybe they aaare :D
[3:14:31] Drizz_36: @Sh4nti not just classic+ but a warcraft 4 RTS game too which is crazy
[3:14:32] Turco11: what is geek?
[3:14:33] Turco11: lol
[3:14:37] Ezcotli: Wow in VR
[3:14:42] Masqerader: like expecting d4 and getting immortal
[3:14:45] SonofHorus82: I'm mentally prepared for WoW: Immortal.
[3:14:56] W5G__: r8 youth
[3:14:58] warrenny: Feel like most ppl dont understand game development me inc
[3:15:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ouch that was cold LUL
[3:15:03] unusuallight: But do you think he would come back if it wasn’t for something REALLY solid too? Devils advocate
[3:15:06] EKS90_: @syla90 If it happens i will be happy ,if it doesn't I will still be happy, I play both versions anyway.
[3:15:07] Pallyofhell: i mean immortal is better than D4 though
[3:15:10] Troniin: It's for Azeroth now. We all work together :p
[3:15:11] Sh4nti: @Drizz_36 KEKW Unrelated but also Starcraft 3 according to 'leaks'
[3:15:21] Masqerader: i think people in general will just be excited that Blizzcon is back it's been 4 years so

[3:15:43] brazkat: i feel like people think chris coming back sitting an exec spot that he is super hands on with the game like he is the sole developer
[3:15:47] Masqerader: highway to the metzen zone
[3:16:04] mavericks312: i just hope retail players dont get themselves hyped thinking metzen is back full time on retail
[3:16:05] syla90: @eks90_ ye well.. unironically lucky you then
[3:16:06] indiegarona: @Towelliee I'm trying to make it out there to Blizzcon.
[3:16:11] Ithylz: I think it will all be smaller than people think and Blizz is overhyping it. I mean Metzen return is probably good but we'll have our standard announcements at Blizzcon
[3:16:14] wildragehs44: @91Niki LUL  100 percent you so correct
[3:16:15] AnimalCrackers_19: What will you be doing Fri, Nov 3, 2023 – Sat, Nov 4, 2023>?
[3:16:17] flebbooo: i used to miss this hype season pre blizzcon, been a couple years now
[3:16:18] indiegarona: I'll bring my "Towelliee HD Gaming" shirt.
[3:16:29] indiegarona: We can take a "12 years later" picture lol

[3:16:59] Masqerader: I will be showing up wednesday, after Blizzcon 3 days in hack vegas
[3:17:18] EKS90_: @syla90 Having claassic be a thing in the wow sphere is a good thing, its a different experiance that I play more casually while i raid in retail, since i enjoy classic leveling and the feel of the game, I don't think recycle always has to mean bad.

[3:18:52] Masqerader: world 1st 0 death boss
[3:19:34] 91Niki: He was definitely a little more than tipsy when I met him in 2017 LUL Ion that is
[3:19:46] SonofHorus82: I hope they announce the re-release of the WoW Magazine.
[3:19:59] khrovaa: why are you leveling another warrior?
[3:20:20] Masqerader: WOW magainze made from the recycled ashes of teldrassil
[3:20:25] WeenieLinguineX: whats project 70 mean
[3:20:43] Masqerader: getting a bunch of characters to 70

[3:43:44] GriltChz: How's Ret looking for next patch?
[3:43:57] kolyy99: do you think that they will give some more love to mythic+ in the future or abandon it ?

[3:56:43] Sarcastard: need 2 packs for 1st light
[3:56:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: That would be a curveball, if 11.0 does come out quicker
[3:56:55] LeoMako: The final season where we get affixes for the raids
[3:57:14] mavericks312: unless your max and your telling everyone there is another raid
[3:57:31] AnimalCrackers_19: Is a 1Boss Raid a Raid?
[3:57:42] Kelticlore: I miss the 3 major patch cycles
[3:57:44] Wcvechten: Ruby Sanctum fated Kappa
[3:57:46] Rictamar: well, 11.0 will need to be out of the way of FFXIV Dawntrail in June

[3:58:11] ashwing_: Return of Ruby Sanctrum KEKW
[3:58:19] mavericks312: 10.0,10.1 and 10.2 wtf lol
[3:58:23] DunzoCD: HUH this is 3 with mini patches in between
[3:58:30] pruteee: I think he forget the .0 patch
[3:58:40] Kelticlore: To me 3 major patch would mean a 10.3
[3:58:51] The_Stogie: when are we getting a murloc expansion
[3:58:51] Jango_: new patch tuesday
[3:58:56] Runestoner: Used to be final raid on patch 10.3. Raid at start of expac, 3 patches with raids. Shadowlands was the stand out in the last like 8 years.
[3:59:03] mavericks312: @Kelticlore you will get a 10.2
[3:59:07] Thoreya: havent heard about FF in a minute
[3:59:12] Thoreya: heard its kinda zzz rn
[3:59:15] pruteee: Well if 10.0 isnt a mahor patch what is it?
[3:59:20] Jango_: story stuff and the final raid i believe
[3:59:21] mavericks312: @Kelticlore with fated raids an dinars
[3:59:33] TheGiant99: I can't wait for D4 season 2

[3:59:42] Kelticlore: @mavericks312 i miss when wed see a x.3
[4:00:06] reggiepowa: that would be fine if it wasn't sub based game, if I pay for a month get me a month worth of content
[4:00:19] The_Stogie: 10.0 isn't really a patch, its more of a release
[4:00:27] Jango_: when you present people with content they think they have to do everything immediately
[4:00:56] mavericks312: @Kelticlore we are getting a 10.3 though
[4:01:16] Cortneysabeast3: @towelliee we have new FFXIV stuff coming out early next month.

[4:02:04] Kelticlore: FF14 new patch come october 3

[4:02:19] Greviev: You can’t expect new content every month… in any online game that is impossible
[4:02:43] reggiepowa: @reggiepowa everything I care about and it's not a month worth of content, unlike WoW where I easily always have things to do

[4:03:40] CCG_337: Actually the content is fine, just there are people that consume content to quick in FF14 the same happens in WoW right?
[4:03:48] dracullus: if it release 7th November, 10.1.7 will be just 9 weeks long
[4:03:55] Jairoy: patch is next tuesday my uncle works for blizzard
[4:03:56] reggiepowa: @Greviev it's on game, I don't have that problem with WoW
[4:03:59] Jango_: @CCG_337 yep 100%
[4:04:03] Wcvechten: there's 1 overtuned ability in that pack
[4:04:09] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee when do you think the 10.2 comes out then
[4:04:21] Greviev: Nope it is a you problem
[4:04:28] 6all: shatter is an aoe around him is a one shot ground slam is a frontal cone
[4:04:33] Wcvechten: yeah they are superslow on fixing it, untill recently WoD TW also had oneshots in Grimrail depot
[4:04:33] Dark_Kornax: you ahve to run out of the chains.
[4:04:57] Jango_: reggie is presenting a bad faith arguement, that is all
[4:05:25] Masqerader: react with the res button
[4:05:43] reggiepowa: yeah sure it's always the players fault, ff is a perfect game
[4:05:45] Jairoy: how many 70s you got now?
[4:05:59] BlueBlurPrime: you cant be in melee of first boss after chain breaks, his aoe kills (is that what we are talking about)
[4:06:00] Jango_: arguing a point from a place of dislike to confirm their own bias
[4:06:15] reggiepowa: I don't dislike the game, it just doesn't have enough content for me
[4:06:22] Jango_: subjective
[4:06:25] reggiepowa: to justify sub price
[4:06:34] mavericks312: also its wise not to argue with FF fans about 14 lol
[4:06:39] is__nova: been a long mid-patch is all, next week it'll be fine
[4:06:40] ZealotryTV: they also got a lot of wow orphans so the negativety could be that too
[4:06:43] cgolden1a: no exploration zone people crying
[4:06:45] Deathtronhammer: FFXIV waits like four months between patches now if I recall right. Like long stretches if I heard right
[4:06:47] archninja64: People upset because there is no real relic weapon grind but many also don’t care for that, like me.
[4:06:49] Rictamar: we just hear less because despite the FFXIV being way bigger than WoW, the content creator space for that game is nowhere near ass fervent or engaged
[4:06:52] reggiepowa: bozja was fun, I loved bozja
[4:06:55] LordxSaura: new player here tried both retail and FF, retails was a lot better experience to me
[4:07:02] Jango_: its not even really about arguing with ff fans as much as it is misinformation
[4:07:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: FFXIV is getting a UFO abduction mount which is a little crazy but awesome at the same time
[4:07:29] mavericks312: @Rictamar explain how it is bigger then WoW?
[4:07:38] reggiepowa: @Rictamar ff bigger than WoW? I don't know about that one
[4:07:55] Jango_: maybe some of it, i think the majority comes in dawntrail
[4:08:13] Rictamar: yes it has a much bigger player base, no question lol
[4:08:14] archninja64: @icequanimity there are not many.  Huge exaggeration from you
[4:08:23] Spaede: FF14 HAppy Trail
[4:08:34] reggiepowa: @Rictamar source trust me bro
[4:08:45] LordxSaura: @Rictamar trends and numbers would disagree i think
[4:08:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it is a race for them
[4:08:47] Jango_: nah, a continuation of aglia
[4:08:49] shosindar: hi
[4:08:51] reggiepowa: I like ff more so it must be a bigger game
[4:08:53] Rictamar: @reggiepowa well you have no source WoW is bigger lol
[4:08:54] mavericks312: @Rictamar source? or is this trust me bro math
[4:09:09] cgolden1a: 24 man alliance
[4:09:14] Epiclurker27893: XBOX players should be hyping the patch up since it should include beta for them
[4:09:15] Rictamar: @mavericks312 all you people saying no, where is your source?
[4:09:25] LordxSaura: @Rictamar google trends, and additional data around it > trust me bro
[4:09:31] dracullus: well some poeple think there are more hardcore players than retail ones, so saying that FF14 is number 1 isn't big stretch compared to that Kappa
[4:09:36] Rictamar: ultimately it doesn't matter, this isn't some argument about what is better, everyone relax
[4:09:37] reggiepowa: @Rictamar well with classic and retail subs merged common sense would say it is larger by quite a lot but regardless I never claimed that it was, you did

[4:09:51] mavericks312: @Rictamar you cant state FF is bigger with more players an then when someone asks for source reverse the question
[4:09:52] Deathtronhammer: I wonder if the slower pace of combat in XIV is meant to be reminiscent of turn based battles of the old game. Either way it's a slog.
[4:10:06] archninja64: His source is the advert that says 27 million adventurers worldwide kek

[4:10:39] Rictamar: classic has a bigger pop than retail no doubt
[4:10:43] Jango_: at this point in time wow probably has more concurrents
[4:11:28] mavericks312: @Rictamar taht also is false
[4:11:34] reggiepowa: @Rictamar a lot of doubt about that as well, another sourcless claim
[4:11:41] Sylphy_TV: ironmouseOMEGALUL
[4:11:49] Deathtronhammer: Probably counting the dormant accounts

[4:13:10] Deathtronhammer: I theoretically have 27 millions friends
[4:13:25] neverbornlucky: how many accounts does raid shadow legends have TOWELLIEE
[4:13:31] Rictamar: @Jango_ well I'm just stating that because some idiot thinks I am because I brought up FF might have more players, and WoW should avoid releasing their next xpac near Dawntrail
[4:13:32] eatonaround: aw man rift. what a game that exists as a game
[4:13:33] Egzolinas: Should we add up the accounts opened for WoW Classic? :)

[4:14:35] Masqerader: more burner accounts than kd
[4:14:37] Rictamar: these are the same idiots who think player numbers = the game is better lol
[4:14:38] Rictamar: just idiots
[4:15:16] Rictamar: @mavericks312 Blizzard has not given the release date, so no you don't actually know, you are just blindly agreeing with speculation

[4:58:45] alexander_r: @alexander_r well, that or void war
[4:58:46] Sollice: I think the story was just weird
[4:58:46] Sylphy_TV: We went to Shadowlands, and Chromie took over. Actually the bad guy LUL
[4:58:54] im_capy: Watch them just be a different timeline of the titans in the end
[4:58:58] ashwing_: I honestly would not mind them going back into the quests and fixing up the lore a bit but thats a big task
[4:58:58] Sollice: The Death pantheon were robots, but the order pantheon is not?
[4:58:59] Redpandalol: We are going to go back into the shadowlands to jump into the jailers body like a megazord to pull the sword out

[5:03:16] valianya: I still think the Shadowlands Pantheon are equivalent to the Titan Keepers, created lesser 'godlike' beings to watch over the Death planes.  And I think the First Ones are just Titans that formed far earlier than the current Titan pantheon and are just older and maybe formed stronger.
