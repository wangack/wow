[1:13:36] Narros: playing the game is alway more fun the just sitting their to get the reward
[1:13:36] Mediocrule: premades... ruins bgs
[1:13:38] jiincs: honor/hr**
[1:13:40] NostalgicDream: ppl giving up immediately is the worst
[1:13:59] jimzyz98ttv: do paladins have book spell ?
[1:14:18] Creampuff1112: Russians in AV actually play the bg and everyone else complains^^

[1:14:31] diarog: wym @jimmybrogamer ?
[1:14:31] JeffersonSovereign: @Swifty  your mode whisped you in chat my link @Swifty  he tsted it
[1:14:37] TheEndIsNear777: FEED ME!
[1:14:40] diarog: @Creampuff1112 they are nto playing the bg, they are just farming HK's
[1:14:40] TheEndIsNear777: >:(
[1:14:46] TheEndIsNear777: thats them lol
[1:14:57] GustavoRanks: but how does that make sense in the end if horde gains more honor ?
[1:14:57] diarog: @Creampuff1112 they don't care about honor though so it's just a bad time for everyone. Slow bgs, now objectives, no honor lol
[1:15:04] Aquatixlol: Yeah the BGs are not fun anymore because of this
[1:15:06] KeLLoG32: that's quality content lol
[1:15:09] jimzyz98ttv: @diarog i was in a dungeon and i play ret paladin and they keept saying book me and then i got kicked on last boss
[1:15:12] Aquatixlol: nobody tries to even play objectively
[1:15:13] DubsRust: are you maining pally on all expansions now?
[1:15:13] Dibles714: You should get a 5 man group for bgs
[1:15:32] Dibles714: 5 man
[1:15:40] jiincs: actually if you are only taking fun into consideration - its more fun when everyones killing eachother not caring about objectives in bgs than playing objectives
[1:15:40] diarog: @jimmybrogamer maybe they referred to "blessing of kings" which is sometimes abbrevated as "BoK" or bok
[1:15:45] HolyAshe54: Go help them
[1:15:46] jiincs: but its not viable for minmaxing honor/hr
[1:15:52] tonshi1: swtor gave bonuses if you sat at a base and defended it to encourage it
[1:15:54] JeffersonSovereign: i whisped to your moderator link from donate, he linked you in chat his link of my picture can u roll up and check it plz @Swifty

[5:27:59] Hirviturkki: @cinax_wow Depends on the server I guess.
[5:28:03] Karma_Kid007: prob on a 30-40+ winsteak as horde lol
[5:28:12] Klassik586: thats funny you say that because i would say the same and i play horde on earthfury
[5:28:18] Klassik586: also solo q
[5:28:21] AzzinothXXX: doesnt really matter right now half the characters are boosts
[5:28:51] Klassik586: @AzzinothXXX yes but a lot of them are geared, i play a boosted pally and im only missing 3 or 4 pieces
[5:28:54] holapirri12: what is this build @Swifty?
[5:29:09] Gillberto98: @karma_kid007 that's disgusting 😉
[5:29:19] Karma_Kid007: last weekend av was a different story alliance won alot lol
[5:29:25] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[5:29:32] Klassik586: @Gillberto98 im about to start queuing up, ill let you know if that streak continues hahah
[5:29:40] Klassik586: @Karma_Kid007 yeah ally was destroying us
[5:29:42] AzzinothXXX: @AzzinothXXX its getting better now but usually thats what decided my games
[5:29:55] syntas_ttv: but I think ur right it depends on the day and obviously RNG on your group when you solo que
[5:30:02] thirstyaxis: is AV still more honor than eots even though its call to arms?
[5:30:24] Karma_Kid007: @thirstyaxis no

[5:32:43] etremis: i was playing av last night and it was like 90% death knights
[5:32:54] Klassik586: honestly its hilarious to me to hear this because just as the other horde guy said earlier i feel like ally always has the upper hand, more people, smarter plays, better geared
[5:33:03] Karma_Kid007: spawn trapped is when you kill them off the rock lol
[5:33:20] thamysticog: what should they do if horde sits infront of spawn
