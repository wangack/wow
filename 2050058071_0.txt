[0:28:27] Tiliathh: awww nice!
[0:28:28] 7thSaga: LUL <3
[0:28:34] UltiBook: the problem with "good pillows" imo is that your body takes some time to adjust to the different posture, so some people won't like a pillow that will be good for them long term
[0:28:38] DrEddible: grats dad
[0:28:39] PhoenixPresence: so much tummytimeeeeeeeee

[0:29:40] Cant0n: Looks mad goofy NGL
[0:29:42] BootsTheAlpaca: 600
[0:29:44] TheButcher_51: You can do the iron neck training with a person giving you resistance in the same direction. Did it for years in football.
[0:29:44] idkfaaaaaaaa: whewww
[0:29:46] squishpl92: ripoff
[0:29:48] scottyg421: that’s what F1 drivers use to get strong necks
[0:29:48] crontikk: Why do I need to workout my neck lmao
[0:29:48] SundriedCameltoe: someone buy me a new computer chair
[0:29:48] tsetse2fly: that's a scam. You dont need that to train your neck
[0:29:50] ghost186_: Its Iron
[0:29:50] bramicmar: if you were starting training anywhere else on your body, wouldn’t you start with body weight???
[0:29:50] wobez: what the fuck lmao
[0:29:50] rijarak: wtf
[0:29:52] bakedthief333: you don't need to buy suttf to train your neck lol
[0:29:52] BL4CKATTACK: Capitalism rules
[0:29:52] gg_dragoon: until a device malfunction or suhm stupid lol
[0:29:53] calaarquen: just use a fitness band @Xaryu
[0:29:54] wobez: what a scam
[0:29:54] im_capy: The world is going insane
[0:29:55] epicalec333: its not that noticeable on your head
[0:29:56] salken: stream with that on
[0:29:57] apvii: buddy acts like hes not rich
[0:29:57] UltiBook: I did similar neck training at PT with just bands @Xaryu
[0:29:58] eskilda: ask them to sponsor you @xaryu
[0:29:58] Mahca_: just get a stretch band
[0:29:59] PMA_1: body weight
[0:29:59] CrispyNugs: bag over head
[0:30:00] Godfarter: I had old school one the straps with weight on chain
[0:30:00] slapshotsd: @Tiliathh i mean this is a super safe way to train your neck, but xar has literally 0 reason to do neck training lmao
[0:30:03] taylorsdank: everything is a million dollars now
[0:30:03] stevey221: 600$ plastic OMEGALUL
[0:30:03] daschadwick: capitalism
[0:30:04] finalflight1: Check out Mike Tysons neck training @xaryu
[0:30:06] Dustin_beaver: You would look better too
[0:30:06] seraph_wow: a bag to head and string ...
[0:30:07] malefic918: Mike Tyson dose a homemade
[0:30:07] TheButcher_51: You can have your girl give you the same resistance.
[0:30:08] chr47: just tie a rope to your forehead EZ
[0:30:08] bandage2: it is the pro one
[0:30:10] bloodmana: They have to pay for the Rogan endorsement somehow
[0:30:11] Beggebin: Just use bands LUL
[0:30:12] gg_dragoon: just g o3d print one
[0:30:13] PhoenixPresence: no
[0:30:14] Whetherey: band
[0:30:14] gg_dragoon: ez clap
[0:30:14] bramicmar: body weight first
[0:30:15] tsetse2fly: Do not buy that
[0:30:15] Elsevier86: Depends what is causing the neck pain. If you are overdoing exercises on your back and shoulders then the muscles can get overly tight and pull on your neck. Not necessarily about strength of your neck muscles
[0:30:15] Atruis_: LUL no
[0:30:16] lIlREDFOXlIl: use a towel?
[0:30:17] DibsieRS: so many pictures tho, has to be more to it?
[0:30:17] slapshotsd: xar if you are adamant about neck training literally hold a plate against your head lying flat on a bench and curl your neck
[0:30:17] layzerbandit: nah to expensive wth
[0:30:18] Highmen3: Did I miss swockdickus?
[0:30:18] Cant0n: Surely you can get a sponsor LUL
[0:30:18] Hoodcash_: Xar you should get an Eight Sleep

[0:30:21] Superhank: dunno about tieing a rope to your neck monkaHmm
[0:30:24] PhoenixPresence: Buy a vr headset at that price
[0:30:24] fan_oh: do some neck ups
[0:30:25] Dibles714: Buy some theraband on amazon
[0:30:25] Kazzator: People give 100subs for 2 mins attention in a stream... same hehe
[0:30:29] PhoenixPresence: PUT WEIGHTS ON YOUR VR HEADSET
[0:30:31] Wilocu: use a towel and a friend lel
[0:30:32] wolfemanxd: Just lift a cinder block for that with a rope.  Thats what I did as a kid.
[0:30:35] st4ckz8: do head bridges like they train in wresting.
[0:30:36] PuffnTuff: Did I miss reacts?
[0:30:37] calaarquen: @Xaryu Fitness band is the cheapest
[0:30:38] gerasticmusic: @Xaryu Are you gonna hit Iron Forge Gym eventually?
[0:30:39] Ervill1: @Superhank cheaper alternative at least!
[0:30:39] vak_hunt: HUH
[0:30:39] MayhemStarterGT: have u ever gotten blood work done to know what your natural testosterone levels are? @xaryu
[0:30:40] taylorsdank: WHOA
[0:30:41] Dustin_beaver: Purple pillows are f'ing amazing. Facts
[0:30:47] Heln0k: $1 for materials $599 for marketing
[0:30:47] acaciashrub: get a sponsor and wear that thing on stream
[0:30:49] Highmen3: Good, just in time for dick swocking
[0:30:51] TheButcher_51: @Kazzator sounds like you're made because you didnt gt a gift sub
[0:30:54] NikYzir: just go to the strip club and look around a lot
[0:31:00] ylva35: huh
[0:31:00] malefic918: Look up Mike Tyson neck workout
[0:31:02] Dibles714: yes
[0:31:02] Dowsha_tv: @Xaryu  Lol in germany it costs €684,25 !!!!
[0:31:04] slapshotsd: chat there are like 50 normal reasons for xar's neck pain and roughly 0 of them are likely to be fixed by resistance training his neck because he's not getting punched in the head or car accidents
[0:31:06] apvii: yeah and then strafe ur head from left to right
[0:31:12] TheButcher_51: You dont need a band just have someone give you the same resistance.
[0:31:16] Hswex: dont do tyson workout
[0:31:16] bakedthief333: please don't buy anything for that lol, Lying on your side, bend your neck by taking your ear towards your shoulder. You will feel the muscles on the side of your neck contracting. Let your neck relax back the pillow. Repeat the required number of times, and then turn over and perform on the opposite side
[0:31:17] john56498: Gdkps banned only in sod or everywhere ?
[0:31:20] tsetse2fly: It's a scam
[0:31:21] Highmen3: I could 3d print that fucker
[0:31:21] Hswex: messed his neck up
[0:31:21] UltiBook: yeah, fitness bands is what I used at physical therapy for a neck prob,worked amazing
[0:31:21] PhoenixPresence: engineering
[0:31:23] gerasticmusic: Seems like a scam
[0:31:25] Atruis_: 100% scam
[0:31:25] efracozz: Its a scam
[0:31:25] ylva35: @Dowsha_tv no it doesnt
[0:31:26] bloodmana: They have to pay for the Rogan endorsement
[0:31:27] tsetse2fly: @john56498 Sod
[0:31:31] checkoff08: ngl i didnt even know you could train neck, sounds scary
[0:31:31] Beggebin: @john56498 Only in SoD P2 for now
[0:31:32] Godfarter: Joe Roger talked about it that adds $300 to price
[0:31:32] bigbillslegmeat: think its meant for professional team orgs
[0:31:33] slapshotsd: it's not a scam it's just overpriced
[0:31:33] PhoenixPresence: gotta be max lvl engi to make it
[0:31:35] Ervill1: why is iphone so expensive? probably costs like $15 to produce
[0:31:37] apvii: Joe Rogan shouted them out so they are getting their bread
[0:31:41] Elsevier86: have a hot bath. cheaper than this nonsense and will relax your neck muscles. Ez
[0:31:41] Wilocu: most online workout equipment is overpriced
[0:31:42] warboy80: just use other neck training stuff bro
[0:31:43] efracozz: I bought cheap at dollarstore
[0:31:55] TheButcher_51: Lay down on a bench have a person push down on your neck and you fight the resistance in each direction. It does the same thing.
[0:32:01] Dowsha_tv: @Xaryu  Write Iron Neck in Amazon anbd see 30$ options lol
[0:32:10] gg_dragoon: F Xarstomp
[0:32:11] slapshotsd: @TheButcher_51 easier to just hold a plate against your own head with your hands tbh
[0:32:14] Elsevier86: @TheButcher_51 This is a good way to risk an injury
[0:32:17] Saadonis: are going to main rogue or mage?
[0:32:18] gg_dragoon: DUDEEEEE +50% MAGE CRIT RUNE ?!?!?
[0:32:18] gerasticmusic: @Xaryu Are you gonna hit Iron Forge Gym eventually?
[0:32:19] Mahca_: @xaryu new PvP trinket
[0:32:21] Atruis_: HUH when did Feb 1st get here?
[0:32:28] im_capy: Listening to a dude who told people to eat donkey dicks and punch people in the head while being a horrible comedian...seems like a good source Kappa
[0:32:34] checkoff08: @xaryu Are you starting off with hc or reg for P2?
[0:32:35] alexgoat94: Xaryu watch asmons rect your video
[0:32:38] Josephxdxp: Yoooo, So how was everyones Chapter 1 of 2024?

[0:32:44] daschadwick: cant put a price on your health and well being!!!
[0:32:48] Ervill1: any holy shockers in chat?
[0:32:48] WHOisTHePianoMan: its a monopoly
[0:32:50] bakedthief333: Shoulder shrug with dumbles
[0:32:52] gorthymog: What char are you going to level first??
[0:33:01] lampsterof79: $600 to cover the legal fees when they are sued for ruining people's necks
[0:33:02] vak_hunt: reactception
[0:33:08] TheButcher_51: @slapshotsd you could def but you run the risk of dropping that plate which can hurt you. So a person would be the safest.
[0:33:08] Elsevier86: @TheButcher_51 I mean you are trusting the other person in that scenario
[0:33:10] slapshotsd: shoulder shrugs barely hit your neck
[0:33:15] anticursed: why does the login screen look like that?
[0:33:15] Mahca_: same as wotlk trinket but 5 min cd still
[0:33:16] freddan92: shrugs are insane for the traps and neck
[0:33:17] thomasclaudepoker: Shrugs are a stupid exercise there's way better exercises
[0:33:24] ech0cide: i'm so glad they banned gdkp
[0:33:30] Ervill1: W
[0:33:31] PhoenixPresence: Yeah so if you overload shoulders your Sternocleidomastoid will in fact help. even sungods and shoulder rolls for calisthenics
[0:33:32] nightrunner6669: Yessir
[0:33:35] bakedthief333: @thomasclaudepoker sure but it's a good start lol
[0:33:36] lurkerl0l: W

[0:33:43] damonkjh: No leaks
[0:33:43] ech0cide: that's how it is in retail right?
[0:33:43] nightrunner6669: The works
[0:33:44] Imboz: its different now?
[0:33:45] damonkjh: pls
[0:33:46] Ingajke: massive
[0:33:47] Umadfajko: OP
[0:33:47] naturalduck: That's crazy
[0:33:51] gerasticmusic: Mages rejoice
[0:33:51] Mahca_: pretty nice with all the new spells I guess
[0:33:52] TheButcher_51: @Elsevier86 Please stop.
[0:33:53] Abuskillz: LOL
[0:33:53] WHOisTHePianoMan: just play human 4Head
[0:33:54] slapshotsd: @TheButcher_51 lemme guess, you never bench press without a spotter
[0:34:03] Abuskillz: It's crazy how that's not in already xD
[0:34:03] BL4CKATTACK: People can trinket blind :(
[0:34:03] nimzlocker: but 5min cd
[0:34:09] gnated: truuu
[0:34:14] Ervill1: WotLK minus
[0:34:15] parker00100: idk seems good in arena but world pvp i would rather have stats i think
[0:34:15] Ebonhawke7: duuuuude please
[0:34:18] Gashunk1: when to use it factor is cool
[0:34:19] gnated: that would be sick
[0:34:21] sengip: SOD areana would be so sick
[0:34:24] SnowToadStudios: Agrend said they weren't doing Arena already tho
[0:34:26] slapshotsd: risk of injury in a gym is so tiny god i can't stand the concern trolling
[0:34:27] Mahca_: probably p3
[0:34:33] salken: what if they cap CC duration in arena
[0:34:36] seraph_wow: they said they werent already
[0:34:40] Josephxdxp: all cc
[0:34:42] chazburner: CC everywhere should be changed to 10 sec
[0:34:44] chazburner: so cringe
[0:34:50] Dustin_beaver: F arenas in SoD
[0:34:51] Ingajke: and not add simillar one for horde
[0:34:57] ImJns: rated BGS in SOD > arena tbh
[0:35:02] acaciashrub: rated bgs would feel classic vibes but not feeling arenas imo
[0:35:02] TheButcher_51: @slapshotsd What did I say. Bring you to that conclusion. Go back to playing wow dog
[0:35:06] kseniamlk: what server do you recommend to join in SoD if I am EU?
[0:35:06] ech0cide: @Dustin_beaver arenas are just pillar humping anyway
[0:35:11] PhoenixPresence: @Xaryu youve been killing it on the Youtube Front :)
[0:35:22] Ervill1: a lot of balancing to introduce arenas
[0:35:31] rns_aurelius: people sit in a city and queue wsg i dont think arena would affect the social side
[0:35:39] Geymear: @kseniamlk livingflame or lonewolf
[0:35:47] feed_the_kitty: No arenas pleaseee. Just expand on open world pvp it's way more inviting
[0:35:55] snapLOUD: they probably need focus targets as well tbh
[0:35:58] apexariestv: I v1 arena
[0:35:58] illists: gdkps gone wow might be worth playing :o
[0:35:59] slapshotsd: @TheButcher_51 dude you are telling me the risk of a 10 lb weight slipping out of your hand(???) makes the most basic simple neck exercise possible too dangerous you have never touched a gym in your life
[0:36:07] Gashunk1: arena fine but don't lock any gear behind it, just for fun and glory
[0:36:08] gg_dragoon: @xaryu thoughts on the Free For All PVP Part of STV Event ?
[0:36:09] Josephxdxp: RBG trainwrecks Pog
[0:36:13] chazburner: 25 sec CC is just so bad anywhere
[0:36:14] Wilocu: @Xaryu more open world pvp events > bgs and arena
[0:36:18] Jubilation12: Xar check out the updated items on wowhead
[0:36:24] pistolkeat: They would have to make so many changes for RBGs to work
[0:36:24] guggenheim07: @Xaryu TBC 9 6 3
[0:36:35] anticursed: why are the colors on the log in screen so different
[0:36:43] anticursed: from what they normallyu are
[0:36:44] magrausla: @Xaryu emergent gameplay is king! We need more world PvP, maybe add settlements you can conquer or something
[0:36:54] foam52: squadW
[0:36:57] fihhl: lets be real... pvp in retail is dead game.  leave sod alone
[0:37:09] sillysheepweepandsleep: miss Xaryu on Retail!!!
[0:37:11] Mahca_: changed dungeon items
[0:37:15] wobez: updated dungeon and profession loot
[0:37:21] Jubilation12: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/updates-to-old-items-in-phase-2-ptr-datamining-season-of-discovery-337483
[0:37:23] cosmin284: fuegoHi good evening  Xaryu  and everyone have a great day and night fuegoL fuegoH
[0:37:25] YesitsSuper: PvP is fun if its fun for you in retail nobody is forcing yall to play it
[0:37:45] LazerDefender: Quality over quantity
[0:37:50] pilot_wk: freedom in limitation
[0:37:59] magrausla: What I love in classic WoW is that there are almost no instances @Xaryu
[0:38:05] chazburner: damn they made a whole book about rated BGs thats sick
[0:38:05] fetza108: bro i watched again yesterday your video "this is what 18 YEARS of mage looks like". i love it
[0:38:05] PuffnTuff: Venruki did a really cool video going over changes casual players want to see in pvp
[0:38:09] kindaopmusic: morning xar
[0:38:10] Ervill1: retail could use some good pruning, too much stuff imo
[0:38:14] killerumbrellas: that philosophy has really helped me with my little pp
[0:38:20] g0dzilla: @YesitsSuper if gear is locked behind pvp, you are getting forced to play it
[0:38:23] Dustin_beaver: If you mention apple cider vinegar....Im out
[0:38:28] joonelius3: today hosted 7 gdkps so far. Normal price for items 5 gold piece. Everyone is so angry of the fact that blizzard punishes our community for gold buyers. While this just moves to people selling RMT boosts to raids and doesnt remove the problem it just makes average gdkp andys suffer.
[0:38:49] fetza108: yes
[0:38:51] YesitsSuper: ...PvE gear is not locked behind PvP but you don't think you need to PvP for PVP gear ? @g0dzilla
[0:38:51] Ebonhawke7: retail pvp's issue is ttk and the crazy amount of self heals/ defensives as long as they stay away from that i think it will be good to reduce cc
[0:38:52] GreanzyW: its gonna hit a mili soon
[0:38:54] TheButcher_51: @slapshotsd Listen, my boy dropped a 10 lb db on his finger and cut it off. To do the simple neck workout all you need is someone else to give you resistance you dont need a 10lb weight. I said you could def do it with a 10lb weight but you can still get inquired by that because of my experience working out. So, try again.
[0:38:58] magrausla: I think when players have to constantly interact with each other the game is always fresh
[0:38:59] nightrunner6669: yeah its nice
[0:39:00] don_kneee: FRFR
[0:39:00] sancocho_jones: do it

[0:39:01] MagicPants1414: NO keep the long
[0:39:05] pilot_wk: @joonelius3 not a fair sample - you're polling people at the very end of the phase. gold buyers are long gone by this point

[1:02:19] Freato: as a new player you don't know

[1:02:21] Alerothan: As a new player you HAVE to do BFA
[1:02:22] gg_dragoon: its invasive to change, not very obvious
[1:02:22] tonygzS: you cant use chromie as a new player @Xaryu

[1:02:34] Ervin96: for first leveling you must go BFA
[1:02:35] jasonstonerrr: you can use chromie and it actually shows you that you can  use chromie while in stormwind
[1:02:36] satinxdd: new player has to do bfa
[1:02:36] macjcool: and wouldnt have any idea
[1:02:42] Cheatoy: yeah who knows how to go to chromie and change

[1:02:46] PervyySAGEEE: you can chose anything from TBC or later
[1:02:47] bakedthief333: You have to do BFA before getting access to chromie
[1:02:51] HecticSpaniard: LUL
[1:02:52] Huntahray: First time players should only play Classic
[1:02:53] jasonstonerrr: no you would know because it pings you the cromie NPC when y ou are in stormwind
[1:02:53] 000000000Machea96: I forgot what is fastest for lvling

[1:06:34] langfotkongla: lobby game

[1:06:40] appaxie: same goes for runescape 3 and osrs.
[1:06:41] Fujinator: that's called nostalgia
[1:06:43] Nefenn: Retail is a good lobby game, Not an mmo
[1:06:45] manyfricksgiven: it's like the 20th season of a TV series, it just gets stale no matter what
[1:06:46] Freato: 100% agreed
[1:06:47] clee0724: truee
[1:06:48] meatbe4t: good morning  @xaryu <3

[1:06:49] ElephantSurfer: its just systems
[1:06:52] Fai_z: so much quality of life that there is no life
[1:06:57] ElephantSurfer: retail is just an amalgamation of systems you queue for
[1:07:01] fetza108: i like retail for some thing and classic for some things. i play both EZ
[1:07:02] hejez: simple = better
[1:07:03] mmodenvin: raids and m+ are actually a challenge tho.
[1:07:09] Tiliathh: Basically FFXIV
[1:07:09] rmac96: going to back to SOD - even just having to look for groups by socializing rather than using dungeon finder is HUGE for culture
[1:07:10] orrenico: @xaryu do you think min/maxing ruined modern RPGs?
[1:07:11] afk_rudy: there's a lot of soul in league
[1:07:15] afk_rudy: what are you talking about
[1:07:17] wobfe: There's also just too much of everything. Too many worlds, zones, mounts, qol
[1:07:19] magrausla: @Xaryu I didn't really play WoW for 16 years and I would never play retail simply because of the QoL made the game boring
[1:07:20] Branura: in older versions you have to do chores, while doing them you are bored and have time to interact with the world and the people
[1:07:25] Kroski: @mmodenvin i dont think anyone argues that
[1:07:25] sengip: 100% nailed it
[1:07:26] HecticSpaniard: when players are used to how it all works, I agree, it feels like a lobby game sometimes
[1:07:27] sunprotofactor: i came back to retail after like 10 years, and was blown away for the first 60 hours then it dropped of HARD
[1:07:29] Jubilation12: @afk_rudy league was never trying to be an mmo. shit comparison tbh
[1:07:30] magrausla: But I LOVED SoD
[1:07:33] Skycoh: i saw your 200lb incline bench for 5, you had 6 or 7 in you. good lift, bro
[1:07:34] seukas: @Xaryu more like an RPG*
[1:07:37] fetza108: we can ys classic is a real mmorp with a magical adventure. i feel this
[1:07:39] ElephantSurfer: @sunprotofactor hella fun for a solid month
[1:07:39] Huntahray: Having friends makes WoW so much better
[1:07:42] sengip: I remember in TBC when u could get the best gear when you got tokens, changed everything
[1:07:45] PhoenixPresence: that should help
[1:07:45] Mahca_: devs called it friction
[1:07:46] MyNameIsVortex: @sunprotofactor 60hours is a solid amount for a game
[1:07:48] Salomexxen: Havent you already watched this video?
[1:07:49] fetza108: no family friendly stream Sadge
[1:07:50] thebigdongerhere: Ok bois time for retail

[1:08:02] bigbrain_zane: retail so boring
[1:08:03] bakedthief333: Classic > retail
[1:08:03] Salomexxen: I feel like I remember watching you, watching it monkaHmm
[1:08:08] Ervin96: it feels more rewarding
[1:08:12] sunprotofactor: @MyNameIsVortex sure but its wow... in classic your at like lvl 40 at that point
[1:08:16] gorthymog: xar you ever gonna do arenas again in retail??
[1:08:24] magrausla: @Xaryu retail has a lot less player interaction and I feel like QoL changed made the game worse as a whole
[1:08:33] afk_rudy: @Dreamzyi look bro, look you may be right, but you know .. well yeah you are just right. xD
[1:08:37] wobfe: The only thing on retail I like better is the combat
[1:08:55] hercybrah: KEKW

[1:19:34] Nurzuul: @StealthyNakroth 2350 not 2400? ya ur alright Kappa
[1:19:35] MILESZxtv: lol just going off of JB's UI, its 100p an information overload

[1:19:47] ruperttheyeti: if you look at
[1:19:48] davisjones_: if you look at
[1:19:49] MyNameIsVortex: @Xaryu Thats a fake UI
[1:19:53] lyndira: if you look at
[1:19:55] Desolacer: if you look at MrDestructoid
[1:19:58] icubicc: LOOK AT THE BEWBS
[1:19:58] voltrix07: @Xaryu bro i never know whats going on in retail..my biggest complaint
[1:19:59] Dreamlights: yeah but CS isn't an mmorpg
[1:20:01] Skycoh: Started playing in BFA and has 10,000 hours played. Yea right. @Xaryu
[1:20:01] hjjenkinson: @zetamop Staysafe was posting in a white supremacist discord channel
[1:20:04] MyNameIsVortex: That's a modded UI @Xaryu
[1:20:07] virboii: you dont have to track 30 cooldowns in counter strike tho
[1:20:08] cabeshpash: wow has a lot more abilities tho
[1:20:11] bralter: fps vs mmo is a little diff
[1:20:13] PhoenixPresence: @MyNameIsVortex how
[1:20:15] Dreamlights: should compare it with similar games
[1:20:17] alokni_: Broke boi
[1:20:17] Slyratt: what document are we reviewing chat
[1:20:17] berserage95: its a 20 year old game the only reason this is a discussions is cause the top players struggle to make ends meat in a dead pvp game
[1:20:18] 5haun: addons
[1:20:19] zetamop: @hjjenkinson what made it white supremacist? that ithere was racist memes?
[1:20:19] snorlaxian1: @hjjenkinson lol
[1:20:21] Jubilation12: @MyNameIsVortex its literally the same layout lmao
[1:20:21] Mahca_: none of those are rpg games tho
[1:20:24] PhoenixPresence: @Xaryu compare it to a level 1 ui
[1:20:25] avjdktv: @Xaryu who is best race horde for warlock pvp? and mage?
[1:20:26] Flaayx14: where in cs go is your interrupt or your charge?
[1:20:26] stevey221: lol
[1:20:27] jiggyspice: Addons is the reason I dont play retail
[1:20:28] sergio44961: YES
[1:20:31] DonSilvers: agree its a turn off
[1:20:31] holycheese333: new world ui best!
[1:20:31] luckyshot6767: @virboii thats a part of the problem why new people dont play
[1:20:34] MyNameIsVortex: @PhoenixPresence In early days of CSGO valve still allowed you to mod your UI
[1:20:34] krunchywow: that what makes WoW tho
[1:20:34] itstommy22: you can just not use addons. its not reallly blizzards fault
[1:20:40] MyNameIsVortex: @MyNameIsVortex It's not.
[1:20:40] Slyratt: what are we looking at
[1:20:41] Skygan: but without addons UI is pretty simple
[1:20:41] muzzy88: @Xaryu same with Path of Exile
[1:20:42] voltrix07: @Xaryu 100% man..my biggest complaint honestly to
[1:20:42] bigwizardo: @berserage95 And yet WoW PVP is struggling at all levels currently.
[1:20:42] PhoenixPresence: I dont use addons
[1:20:43] Nurzuul: it's true, you need at least 8 different addons to pvp properly.
[1:20:46] bellopansu: Pshero has the cleanest UI WoW
[1:20:48] lyrikk91: well, wow has like 30spells for each char??
[1:20:48] ArcheRazor_: its unsolvable without gutting thee amount of talents people have
[1:20:49] krakenunleashedtv: OPEN THE IMAGE IN A NEW TAB FFS
[1:20:50] wonoy: old ui
[1:20:51] gorthymog: that ones old
[1:20:52] 5haun: @itstommy22 its from the perspective of the viewers
[1:20:52] PhoenixPresence: Yeah TRUE
[1:20:54] Bizzylife: right click and do open image in new tab xD
[1:20:54] krakenunleashedtv: YOU DONT NEED TO GO OT THE SITE
[1:20:57] hejez: a teamfight is not easy to follow in league tho
[1:20:59] ambassadormaster: right click, view image
[1:21:01] PhoenixPresence: Could you do the ZERO ADDON challenge? @Xaryu
[1:21:01] bakedthief333: Old school but its the same
[1:21:02] hutchyy917: @Nurzuul not to mention the amount of weakauras
[1:21:03] muzzy88: @Xaryu same with Path of Exile 󠀀
[1:21:04] wonoy: new league ui very simple
[1:21:07] tobs25xd: you could play league without ui except for the map to be honest
[1:21:10] PatchesMcPatch: Why is this document bitching about Jellies UI. thats HIS MODDED UI. its NOT the Blizz default
[1:21:12] virboii: @luckyshot6767 but if they dumb down the game then might aswell play a moba
[1:21:12] DeathToad007: @hjjenkinson staysafe is a known white grievance guy
[1:21:12] krunchywow: i like the complexity of WoW tho
[1:21:14] reteeh: i dont play LOL but i know what interface is old SUSGE
[1:21:17] avjdktv: @Xaryu who is best race horde for warlock pvp? and mage?
[1:21:17] Nurzuul: @hutchyy917 weak auras are cringe lol
[1:21:19] bobgrey69: ARE  U BOUT TO PLAY LEAGYE
[1:21:26] itstommy22: @5haun still hard to blame blizzard for that tbh
[1:21:29] hugsforheals: how come when people talk about classic versus retail its "simplicity makes the game better" but when people talk about pvp they want super complex and just say "get good"
[1:21:30] 000000000Machea96: @avjdktv undead
[1:21:32] berserage95: why do streamers think just because they play wow as a career that the game needs to be an esport? lpl
[1:21:32] sarahuckabee: @PatchesMcPatch the point is he needs UI mods to track all the information in the game
[1:21:33] shabomination: @PatchesMcPatch You cant be "good" at pvp without a UI like that tho
[1:21:36] grylz89: Keybinds for a good player in wow is absolutely wild
[1:21:38] Mahca_: @xaryu I think gamers today just want to pick up a game and be good without work. it’s why rts is dead
[1:21:41] luckyshot6767: @virboii you are not wrong. thats probably the reason most people play mobas instead of mmos
[1:21:42] hutchyy917: @Nurzuul and to be competetive, they're like mandatory. i hate it
[1:21:43] borrx: you cant take away the candy once you give it to people bro @Xaryu
[1:21:46] voltrix07: for sure i hate it
[1:21:48] anmusallam: I love addons
[1:21:48] Josephxdxp: "Scroll through in 1 min" hahaha
[1:21:50] cipherino2: complexity vs new user friendly
[1:21:54] PhoenixPresence: No addon R1 challenge
[1:21:55] Slyratt: am I able to find this google sheet somewhere
[1:22:00] hejez: you have to remove like 20 spells from each class to make it easier to look at
[1:22:04] saintone__: He chooses to have this awful UI
[1:22:05] cabeshpash: I don't think wow will ever be considered a real esport, the balance is just not good enough
[1:22:11] PhoenixPresence: @Slyratt in the bio of venrukis original vid
[1:22:11] the0bserverms: pvp sucks with all the pets on screen too
[1:22:20] Slyratt: @phoenixpresence thanjs
[1:22:22] magrausla: @PatchesMcPatch Because addons give you ingame advantage. If addons could only change the look but not help with gameplay it wouldnt be a problem
[1:22:25] serwaany: @xaryu have you ever played a MOBA game like League of Legends, Dota, Heroes of Newerth? If not would you give it a try on stream?
[1:22:26] tehhguyy: Thats the issue, 60+ keybinds to just play in the most basic sense
[1:22:26] Emaalx11: i like the one that are using for tournaments in classic
[1:22:28] MILESZxtv: shoots, even if new players watch AWC with a simplified UI, they'll still be lost on whats going on
[1:22:28] BL4CKATTACK: There's too many damn pets and stuff on the ground in retail arena
[1:22:29] MyNameIsVortex: No player aside from top 10% use 60 keybinds
[1:22:29] kS_Method: i always loved how vurtne had his ui
[1:22:30] hutchyy917: like watching mesx is so frustrating but I like him and wanted to learn retail DK in DF s1 but was annoyed
[1:22:31] 5haun: wow has too much information you need to know thats basically it
[1:22:38] bigwizardo: F?
[1:22:39] berserage95: instead of saying why wow pvp sucks ask yourself why wow pvp matters, it doesnt, go play a proper pvp game for pvp LUL
[1:22:41] jiggyspice: in addition macros have different icons often LUL
[1:22:43] Nurzuul: @hutchyy917 If ur not use to the sounds in the game, yeah. but most people use weak auras because they can't pay attention, or if they are professional it just makes the game "easier" flashing lights honking horns, WEEE WOO WEE WOO Hhhehehe
[1:22:48] pigvmt: i dont use any addons on retail besides damage meter and bigwigs
[1:22:52] poiskd: @shabomination i mean look at like Hydra's UI, it doesnt have a ton of shit all over it. You don't need half that crap
[1:22:54] MyNameIsVortex: WoW PVP needs visual cues
[1:23:02] TodBobertson: TOOLTIPS IN RETAIL DO CHANGE IN PVP
[1:23:02] Skycoh: retail wow is NOT a hard game to learn. lol
[1:23:03] hutchyy917: @Nurzuul lmao i fuckin HATE it
[1:23:11] borrx: ye u got YT and wowhead but game is harder x5 nowadays @Xaryu
[1:23:19] MyNameIsVortex: @Skycoh Yes it is.
[1:23:26] luckyshot6767: These games were made for really old gamers that used to play complicated board games like D&D. Kids today play way different games
[1:23:28] WHOisTHePianoMan: you almost have to much information, its overwhelming
[1:23:30] bigwizardo: @Skycoh The learning curve is steep for new players. How is that even debatable bro.
[1:23:38] TodBobertson: TOOLTIPS IN RETAIL DO CHANGE IN PVP. @Xaryu
[1:23:41] Ervill1: how about fun?
[1:23:41] kanibasmi: BRO THE RUNES IN P2 GO SO HARD
[1:23:43] sarahuckabee: @Skycoh Pepega
[1:23:43] kanibasmi: SO HAR
[1:23:43] jiggyspice: @Skycoh i tried retail after 15 years. it was very hard to understand anything. Retail is such a chaotic mess
[1:23:49] PhoenixPresence: @Xaryu R1 No addon challenge
[1:23:49] kanibasmi: SOD IS THE REBIRTH OF WOW
[1:23:55] walruscow: wait you play games for fun????
[1:23:56] saintone__: imagine wow being fun xD
[1:23:57] geminuspr: D:
[1:23:59] shabomination: I used to play TONS of pvp... but only random BGs, and i loved it. I havent played more than like 5 BGs since Shadowlands started because you just get annhialated if you arent doing competetive PvP to get the PvP gear
[1:24:01] Atruis_: retail is ez

[1:24:14] Mahca_: gamers don’t want fun anymore sadly, they want meta
[1:24:16] iStrudderz: retail fun? ah thats why people dont play
[1:24:21] anmusallam: facts
[1:24:23] 1nightplays: some ppl make the argument that challenging is fun
[1:24:23] magrausla: @Skycoh How long do you play WoW for? I started playing WoW in SoD and I found the amount of abilities pretty overwhelming on level 25 lol. If you play the same game for years it's hella different
[1:24:24] anmusallam: Fun is important
[1:24:26] obbi87: @Xaryu Wow retail also need less spells. There are too many spells you have to use in PVP
[1:24:29] shalomski: Typical pvper expecting everything
[1:24:31] Niodada: Nowadays people get most fun from rewards
[1:24:31] Bothurin: Fun < Loot
[1:24:36] AngerManagmt: It's just busy work. You have to do tasks everyday for nothing lol
[1:24:37] fetza108: @obbi87 yes
[1:24:46] iStrudderz: @shalomski have you even been listening or just arrogant lol
[1:24:48] berserage95: the wow pvp scene has been the same people for 20 years with next to no new talent, who cares about pvp in wow
[1:24:48] cabeshpash: gladiator loot is easy to get now
[1:24:48] Tiliathh: Minmax and rewards just make the game feel like a second job.
[1:24:51] twitchwarfoo: It would be cool to get fun rewards for people who aren't going for "I'm the best at pvp" but make it so the rewards aren't the reason to pvp, just a fun bonus.
[1:24:51] MAC_l33t: Have xaryu ever been rank 1?
[1:24:51] drewbuckler: Rank 1 feels good being impossioble through right
[1:25:03] cabeshpash: they don't really have different loot for rank 1 though
[1:25:04] PhoenixPresence: @MAC_l33t like 10 times
[1:25:11] grylz89: Did asmon get glad? Enough said hahahha God bless him
[1:25:13] hutchyy917: @Mahca_ we made this weird turn where "being the best=fun" and when players aren't the best they dont think they're having fun. remember vanilla and tbc we would queue BGs for fun
[1:25:26] shalomski: @istrudderz I'm on about the letter writer
[1:25:27] mstr_shake: Dude watching the bracket AWC games yesterday with the top seeds like Liquid going up against like 30 seeds was insane. Liquid killed them in opener 3 games in a row
[1:25:34] hejez: @hutchyy917 truee
[1:25:43] PatchesMcPatch: @hutchyy917 very true
[1:25:52] MyNameIsVortex: Gold is generated more
[1:26:09] Mahca_: @hutchyy917 exactly, it feels like people rush to beat the game or be best without enjoying the process
[1:26:13] PhoenixPresence: YES
[1:26:14] Nurzuul: @grylz89 lol he was pretty good more than some people will give him credit, he had good teammates, for sure.
[1:26:14] prismo5: it doesnt really inflate with more players, the bell curve widens so theres more variance, below average players actually see ratings go down on the other side
[1:26:20] Freato: What is MMR?
[1:26:20] WHOisTHePianoMan: soda is back FeelsAmazingMan
[1:26:31] Akanoodle: !addons
[1:26:32] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[1:26:36] fetza108: @WHOisTHePianoMan where whas he? too a rest?
[1:26:38] PhoenixPresence: "Pain is not the problem, its a symptom of the problem"
[1:26:47] hutchyy917: @Mahca_ which is why im loving level cap in sod. it's forcing people to enjoy the game lmao...of course there's still parse lords out there
[1:26:47] WHOisTHePianoMan: @WHOisTHePianoMan family things
[1:26:47] Erreb88: If you win as much as you lose in MMR it would not inflate right
[1:26:48] crymyz: @WHOisTHePianoMan what where
[1:26:50] grylz89: Is wotlk arena completely dead?
[1:27:02] Dreamlights: @grylz89 no
[1:27:03] Navius5: does more people directly translate to more rating inflation? like is this actually proven?
[1:27:07] WHOisTHePianoMan: @WHOisTHePianoMan just got notif that he went live
[1:27:08] un_original: @WHOisTHePianoMan modCheck
[1:27:10] berserage95: delete this whole essay and you can write one sentence saying its a 20 year old mmo pvp isnt the main focus LUL
[1:27:13] jimmy_irl: @grylz89 lots of cheaters I hear
[1:27:22] ThirdSubstitute: As a WoW noob it is by far the most difficult/least accessible game I've ever gotten into
[1:27:24] stalkerbronet: they need to tone down rotations to wotlk level, rotations have gotten absurd
[1:27:25] NoBluez: @freato Matchmaking Ranking
[1:27:27] MyNameIsVortex: Lots of people not interested in paying a sub on top of the game
[1:27:28] Jubilation12: toxic casuals are my issue. not even wanting to put MINIMUM effort to play your class is toxic.
[1:27:49] Mahca_: @hutchyy917 same, I always take my time leveling and love low level PvP. but yeah it’s crazy seeing people min max and start drama at 25 for their parse lol
[1:27:52] hejez: @ThirdSubstitute yup
[1:27:59] cudiboi: titles are what are relevant usually
[1:28:01] ftien17: its my first season playing pvp and i straight up lie about my xp to get into lobbies
[1:28:01] virboii: all they gotta do is add some inflation for ranked and add some fun modes like dps only skirmishes or dps only solo schuffles
[1:28:24] Nurzuul: the meta has changed so much than back in the day, u can't say wrath xp compares to shadow lands XP, to like dragonflight.
[1:28:28] CrimsonTidalWave: these people don't care about anything
[1:28:40] CrimsonTidalWave: these are not like people who are like trying to be the best
[1:28:42] JaneSylph: we are studying a masters degree of wow
[1:28:46] CrimsonTidalWave: they just wanna play in a inside baseball game
[1:28:50] bloodsloot: They just need to normalize it between lets say 1-1000, or 1-3000.
[1:28:54] Skycoh: i agree that retail is complicated for no reason, and certain systems could be modified, but its still not difficult to learn.
[1:28:54] Mahca_: @hutchyy917 like I have  people in my guild that seem to hate everything unless they’re parsing good
[1:29:00] berserage95: yikes he really made a title about losing money to a billion dollar company LUL what a clown
[1:29:00] Slyratt: damn this guy started playing in BFA and is way better than I am feelsbadman
[1:29:03] crvyxn: are you reading a manifesto? monkaW
[1:29:06] CrimsonTidalWave: Wow PVP doesn't breed excellence anymore...
[1:29:11] virboii: street fighter 6 has the best ranked system ive ever seen imo
[1:29:14] bigwizardo: @CrimsonTidalWave Honest question here bro, how do you follow the stream with audio off?
[1:29:18] Rebukenx: 2.8k+ rating 10 years ago GIGACHAD
[1:29:21] Andy_BP: whats this?
[1:29:25] Tiliathh: Dude this guy wrote up this whole doc, when he coulda just played a different game lol
[1:29:34] Niodada: @Slyratt bfa was 5,5 years ago
[1:29:42] CrimsonTidalWave: @bigwizardo I like reading pretty lips
[1:29:42] DeathToad007: bro i can ask snutz questions about warlock
[1:29:44] davisjones_: Tiliathh so true, but its easier to hate right
[1:29:48] jimmy_irl: 2s with pikaboo when? @xaryu
[1:29:50] bigwizardo: @CrimsonTidalWave Kek
[1:29:53] hutchyy917: @Mahca_ yeah like, people are allowed to find parsing fun sure. but like, dont act like thats what is important or act like we're not all having fun bc we're not parse sweats
[1:29:53] berserage95: nobody starts wow in bfa, the worst expansion to date then gets this invested to write a massive essay
[1:29:58] xdeathbreachx: aside from some super cheesy shit i actually think pvp is pretty fun atm
[1:30:04] CrimsonTidalWave: There's no real skill involved...
[1:30:07] ItsMaseTV: life has never been more competitive in all aspects because of the internet
[1:30:09] CrimsonTidalWave: It's just gear checking
[1:30:14] 000000000Machea96: Only pvp i want to watch is mak gora
[1:30:17] TodBobertson: Man has antiquated Exp and is mad nobody trusts it, so he writes 26 fucking paragraphs? Seems like mental illness... Well articulated mental illness, I have to give some credit... But still...
[1:30:23] anmusallam: I got lucky and found lots of cool gladiator people to teach me in durotar
[1:30:24] MyNameIsVortex: People are also not willing to teach newcomers. It's always "google search"
[1:30:30] CrimsonTidalWave: Best PVP was the end of BFA with corruptions
[1:30:30] Rebukenx: balance bad
[1:30:45] CrimsonTidalWave: Corruptions created the best PVP outcomes 10/10
[1:30:51] Nurzuul: they have some good points.
[1:30:51] CrimsonTidalWave: Would do again
[1:30:52] Rebukenx: imbalance is fun
[1:30:59] CrimsonTidalWave: Nobody likes these dandy's
[1:31:02] JaneSylph: this guy is teaching at the wowology faculty for sure
[1:31:05] VG_Ares: In cata DK blood
[1:31:06] CrimsonTidalWave: Nobody in real life like dandy's
[1:31:06] virboii: i had so much fun in BFA season 4 lol
[1:31:12] hejez: pom pyro one-shot fun YEP
[1:31:14] cabeshpash: depends on what you mean tho, still not taken seriously as an esport because it's not balanced
[1:31:15] d_Rcohle: gdkp banned is the better decision of sod
[1:31:17] JackLarsen4: unbalance creates a textured meta which is generally good
[1:31:21] ferknasty: druids with doubled mastery in cata for half a year was balanced lololol
[1:31:25] CrimsonTidalWave: I want yall to know a dandy opinion is formed by a woman..  in a mans mouth
[1:31:27] The_Crane: Retail is just visually overwhelming. There's are 20 health bars, 40 keybinds, and endless add ons on everyone screen
[1:31:32] obbi87: @Xaryu Esport destroyed wow
[1:31:34] saintone__: every class in mop had one shot potential and true balance wasnt there but still was so feelsgood to play
[1:31:34] CrimsonTidalWave: Nobody likes dandy opinions...
[1:31:35] ferknasty: feral druids in cata were the most fun ive ever had in wow
[1:31:38] Mahca_: @hutchyy917 yep that’s true, some people definitely enjoy it. just crazy it seems like they torture themselves to dungeon, PvP and raid all so they can try to parse
[1:31:39] CrimsonTidalWave: Wow PVP is trash as fuck
[1:31:42] BL4CKATTACK: Mop 15 second warlock gate was the worst part of mop
[1:31:43] CrimsonTidalWave: it's never been balanced
[1:31:43] peetca: wotlk/panda was fun because you coud play pvp any spcec any comp (not for super high rating) but you could with small success.
[1:31:43] punkarse93: none of this is new, been like this for a LONG WHILE, whats the point of this
[1:31:45] CrimsonTidalWave: it's never been fun
[1:31:48] CrimsonTidalWave: It was fun once
[1:31:51] CrimsonTidalWave: Corruptions
[1:31:59] stevey221: this is why wow retail is so bad. the meta is only a few classes realistically rn
[1:32:00] CrimsonTidalWave: Fuck the buttons the gear check is boring
[1:32:01] twitchsonic7: @xaryu mirrors are balenced but not fun?
[1:32:03] magrausla: @MyNameIsVortex the problem for me is that I actually enjoy discovering things myself. I hate copying meta builds or playing reading a manual etc. But a lot of people have 0 tolerance
[1:32:04] MyNameIsVortex: @The_Crane I play retail with none of the things you just mentioned and it works perfectly fine
[1:32:04] CrimsonTidalWave: The gear check was fun
[1:32:13] CrimsonTidalWave: The gear check engaged everybody every player
[1:32:16] CrimsonTidalWave: The gear check was
[1:32:17] voltrix07: 100% man
[1:32:17] bhphreak: excuse me
[1:32:17] kefaloni4: fifty?
[1:32:19] CrimsonTidalWave: Fun
[1:32:19] Fai_z: jesus.... why would anyone want to learn 50 keybinds
[1:32:19] ichewbubblegumm: fifty????
[1:32:20] siris411: "buut-ons"
[1:32:21] CrimsonTidalWave: now it's trash
[1:32:21] LJimbox: lol
[1:32:21] TodBobertson: @Xaryu Make a class / spec tier list across ALL EXPANSIONS? Would prob come out to about even and balanced if you combined all previous tier lists. Every spec has been BIS at SOME point.
[1:32:22] southskee: 50 lmao
[1:32:22] JaneSylph: 50?????
[1:32:22] Misfit980: 50?!?!?!?
[1:32:25] Diddly_dope: 50?!
[1:32:25] CrimsonTidalWave: fuck this game
[1:32:25] camshreds: the hand gestures lol
[1:32:27] The_Crane: Retail is so ugly to watch for an average viewer. There are 9 million different things on the screen
[1:32:28] jbarish: 50?!?!?!
[1:32:28] sergio44961: Bra I have like 20 max lol
[1:32:28] Cheatoy: fifty like 50?
[1:32:29] lithops1: 50????
[1:32:30] JaneSylph: more like 15
[1:32:30] TheTurtlesaur: lol i thoguht you were saying 15
[1:32:31] iPlayCuzFun: 55 keybinds???????????
[1:32:33] ItsGrez: 20 bro
[1:32:33] Murkilad: uh...10 keybinds are fine to me
[1:32:33] un_original: WoD had enough buttons, legion had too little, MoP had too many. Shadowlands had too many binds, DF has alright-ish amount
[1:32:34] cyborgbear11: 10 max
[1:32:34] Misfit980: Eminem ???
[1:32:37] hejez: holy ICANT
[1:32:38] kefaloni4: what the heck, most I have is like 15
[1:32:39] christiangodwarrior97: 50 is waaaaay to many lol
[1:32:40] MyNameIsVortex: Where are you getting 50 binds from dude
[1:32:40] jbarish: I have like 20 max and I’m out of binds
[1:32:40] CoachHuck: How you doing 50 keybinds? I can barely focus on 10 LOL
[1:32:41] obbi87: @Xaryu wtf? 55? I would say less the 15, max 10 at best
[1:32:41] lithops1: how about 25-30
[1:32:41] virboii: why are you guys surprised dont you play pvp?
[1:32:42] Santu110: i only use 10 to 15
[1:32:42] iPlayCuzFun: 20 is a sweet spot
[1:32:43] Darrok_86: bro 50?!
[1:32:47] Darksyde1029: My druid in MoP had like 80 keybinds KEKW
[1:32:47] ShiNe_o: 50 way to much
[1:32:49] sarahuckabee: people don't realize arena 123 keybinds exist
[1:32:50] grantgatz: I had like 40-50
[1:32:51] Indomitablez: Wait, you guys use keybinds?????
[1:32:51] voltrix07: even 50 to much
[1:32:51] jbarish: 15-25 is good
[1:32:52] Beanie_the_Thrower: DW he means 15, if not this is a horrific take
[1:32:52] kirchenragnarok: bro 50?
[1:32:52] Thinkstop: what diff did you get from keybinds in Classic vs Retail?
[1:32:54] MyNameIsVortex: @Xaryu Most people don't use more than 10 keybinds
[1:32:55] Nurzuul: I love everybody talkin smack about this letter but the moment u mention binds everybody is like "wait, u play with more than 20 binds?" hilarious.
[1:33:00] Mahca_: think 20 is good middle ground
[1:33:00] Cheatoy: how many years like 15 or 50 years on your mind? @Xaryu
[1:33:01] taylorsdank: it's easier to get to 50 when you're using things like R, CTRL R, ALT R, etc
[1:33:03] sarahuckabee: everyone saying 50?! doesn't play 3v3
[1:33:03] CrimsonTidalWave: yall dandys...
[1:33:05] Darrok_86: 50 thats cap
[1:33:08] CrimsonTidalWave: Wow community is so soft
[1:33:08] iPlayCuzFun: ive never seen u use 55 key binds xar
[1:33:08] poiskd: Everything to the left of "6TGB" on the keyboard, with alt+shift+ctrl mods, or you're not trying.
[1:33:10] hutchyy917: @Mahca_ we're all chasing that high when we first got into wow and forcing ourselves to prove we're "getting better". and bc we're better, we're having fun. take me back to 2006 when i sucked and was having the time of my life
[1:33:11] kirchenragnarok: 50 keybinds lol, do u bind a train macro or what
[1:33:13] CrimsonTidalWave: BALKANIZE BLIZZARD!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:33:19] bakedthief333: Yup
[1:33:21] CrimsonTidalWave: Dandy boys...
[1:33:23] iPlayCuzFun: @slapped101 yes
[1:33:25] bigwizardo: @taylorsdank Ctrl Shift Alt R for the mega-gamers out there EZ
[1:33:30] hejez: @poiskd holy shit
[1:33:32] PhoenixPresence: @slapped101 yes he made a response vid to asmons take on gdkp its on YT
[1:33:36] taylorsdank: @bigwizardo lolololol
[1:33:38] CrimsonTidalWave: Balkanize Blizzard
[1:33:39] bhphreak: let me play random BGs with my friend cross faction
[1:33:43] bhphreak: id be subbed still
[1:33:44] grantgatz: yeah tbh its not that hard to memorize 50 binds if you play for months
[1:33:45] JaneSylph: i've played with more than 50 but i think its not OKAY its too much
[1:33:47] mstr_shake: 40-50 binds, not abilities. For example, counter spell arena 1, 2 or 3, all separate binds
[1:33:51] TodBobertson: @Xaryu It has been 17 minutes. We shoulda' just watched the clip ROFLMAO!
[1:33:53] saintone__: yeah solo shuffle 20 mins for a match if not a healer
[1:33:53] JaneSylph: 20 ish would be ideal
[1:33:54] walruscow: 3s is too complicated for me, I like 2s
[1:33:59] CrimsonTidalWave: it's trash xary
[1:34:02] berserage95: wow is a dying game and pvp is dying with it, its just a dying game it has nothing to do with pvp
[1:34:05] Alerothan: Waaaaah stop playing the gamemode you like and play the one I like!
[1:34:11] xdeathbreachx: if shuffle queues were shorter id play sm more
[1:34:12] JakePetts: @CrimsonTidalWave why are you here?
[1:34:13] Skycoh: started playing in BFA, has 10,000 hours played and 10,000 hours into typing this document. could just go play a different game. @Xaryu
[1:34:14] ChesIock: they should add more animations
[1:34:19] xo_navi: Wrath and MOP style would flop retail
[1:34:20] Tiliathh: That was excessive.
[1:34:27] Diddly_dope: @Xaryu can u explain how u even get to 50?
[1:34:27] MyNameIsVortex: @Xaryu Where are you getting 50 buttons from
[1:34:29] m1lkman10: Okay now do PVE
[1:34:32] yashatheboi: League has high skill ceiling play with 6 buttons
[1:34:32] JaneSylph: now we all have a Phd
[1:34:33] RedsquaredTV: @Xaryu Lets just read the letter instead of watching a 17 minute video. It'll only take 1 minute! LOL
[1:34:35] bakedthief333: Nice work by him
[1:34:35] BarCassi: masterclass kekw
[1:34:36] Shunmao: you wrote this?
[1:34:36] Nurzuul: Sounds like this letter was a hit
[1:34:39] CrimsonTidalWave: @JakePetts cause i fuck better than your mother, and wife, and daughter if she ever becomes anything worth fucking
[1:34:39] yashatheboi: Something to think about
[1:34:40] classygamer17: SODA is BACK streaming !Pog
[1:34:41] afk_rudy: game started dying since they took off deep freeze, speaking stats :p
[1:34:44] virboii: i switched from wow pvp to street fighter 6, having a blast
[1:34:44] VashtorRhul: Problem with the game is it's become to meta/look stuff up or never do content, anti new player so no one new joins or stays
[1:34:46] Mahca_: @hutchyy917 man that’s why I love playing with my friend that’s new to wow. he just runs around doing whatever random stuff and i follow. great to relive it through him
[1:34:52] MyNameIsVortex: But most people don't even get above 20
[1:34:54] poiskd: @Diddly_dope bind abilities to buttons 6TGB on keyboard and to the left -- ctrl/alt mods on some of them, boom 50 ez
[1:34:54] woofwoof2121: who wrote that paper?
[1:34:55] Cheatoy: wut
[1:34:56] Abruty: 40 would be oki
[1:35:01] Thinkstop: what diff in keybinds did you get for Retail vs Classic?
[1:35:04] nikola420tesla: Out of those 50 you have a lot you dont use on a reg basis
[1:35:05] NoBluez: hope they read the letter lirikTHINK
[1:35:05] sarahuckabee: @CrimsonTidalWave what

[1:35:20] gg_dragoon: sus
[1:35:20] cyborgbear11: 10-12 max for me
[1:35:21] sarahuckabee: @CrimsonTidalWave huh
[1:35:21] CrimsonTidalWave: @sarahuckabee what?
[1:35:22] hutchyy917: @Mahca_ hell ya, let him discover everything himself. thats why i like watching the uber series hes covering
[1:35:27] davisjones_: Oh hell na
