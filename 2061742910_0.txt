[2:01:18] Tarithal: Viewer healer dorkibear did a 29
[2:01:28] Galois_rg: I’m a viewer, let me heal
[2:02:48] Galois_rg: veganknight bricked my 28 dht last week
[2:03:16] Cayzen: how are the affixes for pug pushing (aroung 25-27)?
[2:03:49] Emm_Zee: @Cayzen It's the worst pug affix (tyrannical)
[2:04:05] Cayzen: yeye aside from that ofc :D
[2:04:16] Emm_Zee: Also tanks will stop queueing up after 1 day of storming, I'm sure
[2:04:46] danaxvx: I had a healer in a +21 Fall that didn't know how the dot on the second boss worked or that they needed to heal chromie on the last boss.
[2:05:15] IAmSolari: @danaxvx that is what we call a boosted player
[2:05:24] lynxie26: one time I just forgot about chromie and bricked our key
[2:05:34] danaxvx: The tank also pulled 5% short
[2:05:48] Emm_Zee: @danaxvx HUH missing count in fall
[2:05:56] IAmSolari: how tf do you pull short in fall
[2:06:20] danaxvx: @IAmSolari verrrrrrry carefully.
[2:06:21] zolal3: everything is possible in pugs
[2:06:58] IAmSolari: I pull all 4 dragons every week in fall to keep my healer in check
[2:07:12] danaxvx: @IAmSolari TYFYS
[2:07:52] IAmSolari: @danaxvx he needs the practice
[2:07:57] lynxie26: just tell healers "I'm dead" and they'll fight forever to keep you alive
[2:10:18] IAmSolari: @lynxie26 Mine just lets me die and fights to keep the dps alive

[2:29:17] JarRulez: how are you tracking when to use blackout kick?
[2:29:39] tvilk: i am tilter Deadge
[2:29:44] chalupascript: @JarRulez it has the cooldown of one gcd so all u need to know is u cant bck twice in a row
[2:29:50] chalupascript: no need to track
[2:29:58] Shifftqt: look above the mana bar it has teachings stacks
[2:30:09] Sbegary: blackout kick is available every other global, so dont need to track

[2:31:23] nightbreeze93: shadowmeld you mean panda punch
[2:31:32] smBarrel: for debuff probably
[2:31:50] 54714: surely it meant panda punch Clueless
[2:32:06] Sbegary: @JarRulez TP builds stacks of TotM, so you want to blackout kick with stacks of that and ideally in a cleave scenario
[2:32:18] averitia_1: what is it thats telling him "cd" and "shadowmeld"
[2:32:31] Sbegary: RSK is always prio over Blackout I believe

[2:40:54] ShaggySummers: I enjoy aug a lot because I like the support idea and tbh it's nice not being tracked properly on details :3
[2:41:00] miichael___: aug also stinks for certain keys
[2:41:06] miichael___: like waycrest Goliath boss
[2:41:09] 54714: double mage rogue Clueless
[2:41:12] 54714: iykyk
[2:41:14] tvilk: growl why do you gotta shit on the peoples 4 mage dream
[2:41:19] Satimy: Delete aug from the game tbh
[2:41:22] diamondq8i: triple mage will kill high hp target before low hp LUL
[2:41:24] zolal3: @ShaggySummers especially the 30% ebon might uptime
[2:41:30] IAttackYou: NonVerbal
[2:42:02] reppap: @tvilk ok but if you're the tank you're king right? just order them to figure it out PepeLa
[2:42:19] TwicksTV: read my whispers RAGEY
[2:42:42] tvilk: @reppap I was very close to saying "i can't play the game for you" but i didnt.. we ended up calling the night early cus of bad runs and i was tilted from the start
[2:42:54] baxx: where can I see the mdi group? on raiderio it shows me the brackets blank without any teams Okayeg
[2:43:25] Rhagta: can I ask what the website is called for surviving mechanics

[2:43:55] ShaggySummers: @zolal3 you can't really expect me to rip 30%. I'm a 10 and below guy
[2:43:56] Emm_Zee: @tvilk If you're a vdh then it kinda makes sense to do ccs/kicks because it's hard for others to track, as well as lust/general cd usage as part of the route, but how to live yeah that you cannot teach
[2:43:57] flockheart: KEKVibe
[2:44:06] miichael___: for Goliath boss i meant if anyone other than Aug gets root you have like 50 pct damage instead of 67%
[2:44:29] Ajatus: @baxx look at the time trials tab
[2:44:42] chalupascript: sea star vs crit blood for mistweaver?
[2:44:45] phont_: how does the aug get out?
[2:44:46] tvilk: @Emm_Zee it was just too much Shruge i can't micromanage 4 other peoples cds while also trying to keep myself alive
[2:45:03] IAttackYou: do you ever miss chow
[2:45:10] MicHawkh: just go bearform

[2:45:47] Emm_Zee: And do the good pulls if cds are ready
[2:45:51] baxx: @baxx Time Trials: Teams? it doesnt show what group they are in for the tournament just their placement in the time trials Shruge

[3:31:25] Kettos: It doesnt seems fair a shadowbolt from last boss just hit you like a truck
[3:31:41] reppap: instead of one-shotting things could be a dot that kills you in 5 seconds or whatever so you at least have a chance
[3:31:44] zolal3: how about some mons give you time like +30 sec
[3:31:45] greathasher: Get rid of tyran
[3:31:47] Harleybane: 1 shot mechanics should be like stagger, it puts you at 1% hp at most
[3:31:49] greathasher: Easy fix

[3:31:57] njokkio: new affix at +30, cheat death?
[3:32:29] Adrang: @Veree depends on how high you mean by "high"
[3:32:40] ConchubarOD: The point at which everything is that deadly it feels like timing the key should not be possible due to lack of dps etc
[3:32:46] Kettos: I know its doable, but some classes are literally unplayable at high encounters
[3:34:24] zebajin: i played Enhance in m+ in Legion that was PURE Pain on tyra weeks
[3:34:26] ShaggySummers: They actually need to fix my class. Cause mine is always the undertuned one.
[3:34:33] ShaggySummers: it's so easy
[3:34:44] dlllont: speed up cast times so you have to be quicker on group coordination
[3:35:14] Kettos: GL looting it withouth a guild
[3:35:15] reppap: all damage should just be stagger damage up to like 100%  of your hp
[3:35:23] medzwow: so should the heath of mobs go up more rather than the damage scale like it does so its more you vs the timer rather than you vs "can you live this"
[3:35:29] ShaggySummers: @dlllont that sounds like the worst idea D:
[3:35:30] hectorpflaume: just started playing again after a year or so and thought about healing for the first time. any tips on a healer thats easy to learn?
[3:35:34] lord_konstantine: This is my first M+ season and I have been enjoying myself a lot FeelsOkayMan Started gaming in November
[3:35:52] Lottinius: more health and ditch the healer GIGACHAD
[3:36:03] Kettos: I wish they we're harder, not larger
[3:36:08] Kettos: No homo
[3:36:13] PHASZR: Maybe another way to look at this, is to leave it as-is, but keys dont deplete and you can choose what keys to do. It would shift-right all the dungeons but might just be more fun overall at all levels of keys
[3:36:13] guynormally: @dlllont that wouldn't require quicker response/coordination. you would be gaming against weak auras to perfectly time your cc. unfun
[3:36:28] medzwow: so get rid of tyran but bosses still go up with key level
[3:36:34] greathasher: I hope next expansion there is a major rework with affixes
[3:36:48] greathasher: Especially Fort and tyran
[3:36:48] Ruinx81: If they don’t deplete that would cause so many other issues
[3:36:53] medzwow: just a static fort but more health on mobs
[3:37:04] PHASZR: @Ruinx81 Such as?
[3:37:05] medzwow: err not static fort
[3:37:12] Kettos: Its a hot take, but some seassonal affixes made the tyran bosses easier
[3:37:17] Kettos: Like S1 shadowlands
[3:37:21] goblingher: one way to fix shields or totems on bosses is to make the removal/death of totem splash similar damage on the boss or smth
[3:37:22] Jinfelicity: bosses with inconsistent spell queueing are big annoyance too
[3:37:31] Razdruid: I think they should keep tyran but change how the health scales like you guys were talking about
[3:37:31] greathasher: Yeah at least good positive affixes
[3:37:58] Terodactyl_: ah shit the return of venthunt baby let’s gooo!

[6:57:18] RedxZone13: Wild that key has been timed on a 31
[6:57:36] Emm_Zee: @patrins Sending in shield phase helps with dungeon timer (if you get extra uses), sending in non-shield phase can skip a shield

[6:58:30] Chibrotle: theya re talking out what went wrong

[7:06:19] swimmydude: Playing on tilt is a you problem. Gotta work on that mental attitude. Pretty useful to learn for any game honestly.
[7:06:27] zachl_: i mean im depleting to random shit too with my team @DieNivea people just need to understand you are GOING to fail

[7:07:13] Vods: Just go NonVerbal
[7:07:16] hunterzx: a lot of the random mistakes can get fixed by repetition and practice, making things like mental checklists in auto-pilot. So every deplete is progress

[8:20:19] harmless52: what about tott is so hard at 30?
[8:20:29] hunterzx: avade is never wrong
[8:20:32] AvalenaTV: getting oneshot by every boss
[8:20:44] hunterzx: healer can definitely get the first 2
[8:20:44] Emm_Zee: He says it's healer insta -> healer late -> avade -> repeat
[8:21:20] AvalenaTV: isnt the initial dmg on 30 almost a oneshot?
[8:21:25] hunterzx: on my mistweaver i get the first 2 insta, have to start healing alternating after 3rd
[8:21:26] AvalenaTV: we tried 28 and it was nuts
[8:22:13] hunterzx: think i watched a feral die in 2 ticks on a 27 tyr
[8:22:45] Storm_Flicker: Just cancel raid to watch key
[8:23:10] AvalenaTV: play fistweaver in altraid
[8:23:18] AvalenaTV: tons of fun in raid too
[8:23:39] AvalenaTV: and u can snatch all the healing cause u dont care too much about the cds of others
[8:23:56] hunterzx: does not look like prodigy needs loot
[8:24:17] hunterzx: unless prodigy needs suncaller trinket for dps memes in brh
[8:24:34] Emm_Zee: Prodigy kinda wants avoidance myth track items surely
[8:24:39] narwien1: @yumytv You really want to go crit heavy in raid, corrupted rage/crit rune, any crit/vers gear you might have!

[8:49:33] IAttackYou: talking about me SadCatThumbsUp
[8:49:36] IAttackYou: im sorry growl
[8:49:45] Tolivold: he wrote the holy priest review and hes seen as a pure disc player
[8:49:54] Tolivold: thats why hes getting hate
[8:49:58] zachl_: ?
[8:50:01] zachl_: healers are cringe
[8:50:02] gfkoe: its the spec articles right, everyone is getting hate from them i feel like.
[8:50:04] sylviem_: lmk if someone talks shit about u i'll talk mad shit back
[8:50:08] sylviem_: i'll defend ur honor
[8:50:09] MierkaBlue: he wrote a decent piece on priest and people went mad because "he plays just disc" (not true)
[8:50:23] zachl_: jak has BEEN a priest for a long time
[8:50:37] zachl_: if ur mad about that honestly u have other stuff to worry about
[8:50:37] ottomr1990: some people just exist to make people feel bad about themselves on the internet and it's gross
[8:51:00] jenkinsdonuttv: people do be dumdum sometimes
[8:51:12] Drohgoh: make sure he says where to vote the weapon
[8:51:14] sylviem_: ppl will nitpick others to avoid looking at the dumb shit they're doing
[8:51:16] Drohgoh: oh nooooo
[8:51:41] Devonellah: Jak has played Holy and Disc so he has the right to express what he feels about it...
[8:51:57] Devonellah: Pretty solid too... ahah
[8:51:59] zachl_: @Devonellah ya but u dont account for the fact that healers are cringe and petty
[8:52:09] Drohgoh: 10/10 revival
[8:52:23] Devonellah: Huh? ahah Healers are awesome lol
[8:52:37] zachl_: ya.... lol
[8:52:38] sylviem_: well
[8:52:47] SCMSV: like if Jak made an article on shadow I could see more logic behind the flak but bro its a healer spec and he's made content for both for years
[8:52:52] galaxyxxdd: @Drohgoh  why you not in raid sir?
[8:53:03] Devonellah: Exactly SCM - totally agree
[8:53:31] zachl_: ya who do u think the people shitting on him are
[8:53:32] Devonellah: He's such a nice guy too.. like amazingly nice ahah
[8:53:36] zachl_: chances are its not tanks or dps players
[8:53:57] galaxyxxdd: @zachl_ you'd be suprised lots of dps players shit on healer takes all the time
[8:53:58] SCMSV: oh yeah its def the healers grilling his shit
[8:54:11] SCMSV: CLASSIC
[8:54:16] The_Mail_Man__: @zachl_
[8:54:33] zachl_: and with that my point stands healers are cringe and petty MAJORW
[8:54:46] galaxyxxdd: i mean so are dps players
[8:54:49] galaxyxxdd: yet here we are
[8:55:00] Emm_Zee: @zachl_ Sure but that's more "stfu healer" than "you play disc instead of holy wtf" xdd
[8:55:12] sylviem_: everyone is cringe and petty
[8:55:19] galaxyxxdd: ^^
[8:55:29] zachl_: if ur a respected healer ur dps suck up to u
[8:55:40] zachl_: dps players are generally nicer than the other roles ive found
[8:55:42] Devonellah: Yah he goes ABOVE and Beyond!! Plays multiple healers and plays them incredibly well.. a professional :)
[8:56:07] sylviem_: i've been flamed by dps players more than any other role and it's not even close
[8:56:08] Emm_Zee: @zachl_ Less "desirable" role = gotta be nicer I guess
[8:56:15] Devonellah: It's probably some form of jealousy and some power play with the people who are upset - its always a power play lol
[8:56:36] galaxyxxdd: yup whenever a dps player makes a mistake or i make a mistake dps players always flame me
[8:57:07] zachl_: @Devonellah "you wont get any hate from people doing better than you"
