The STORY and CHARACTERS are ACTUAL COMPLETE GARBAGE F TIER SHIT. It is LITERALLY COPY of TOKYO GHOUL with PRETTY GOOD ANIMATION and ART. IT IS ALL IT IS. A FUCKING COPY, WORD FOR WORD ALMOST of the STORYLINE. IF YOU WANT A REAL GOOD ANIME, YOU WATCH SWORD ART ONLINE. THAT IS THE BEST ANIME OF ALL TIME. SEASON 1 OF SWORD ART ONLINE.
