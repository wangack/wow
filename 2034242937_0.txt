[1:11:43] SyckJabbo: boomstick
[1:11:50] Jack_the_Dipper: But why not get a clip-on-mic that you can clip on your shirt? @Naguura

[1:13:42] Sebleh: Shruge
[1:13:43] Kuroz: the sound in the clip isn't bad but people would still cry about it
[1:13:48] Burnprof: so, again you are just dismissing Sebleh's idea and now even blaming chat for it???
[1:13:51] Kuroz: at least that's what they do with her
[1:13:56] Andersonmps: this is pretty good sound
[1:14:05] Jack_the_Dipper: is that also a Rode?

[1:15:54] Sebleh: i mean lmk if you want me to ask. At the end you’re gonna do what you want to do

[1:20:47] Sebleh: I pulled it from her discord

[1:21:04] Andersonmps: That*
[1:21:20] TotallyNotRaien: how often are you gonna use the mic?
[1:21:35] Jack_the_Dipper: I love those mixers
[1:21:41] Jack_the_Dipper: yahama?
[1:21:44] Sebleh: well she said she wanted to do cooking streams for her meal prep too
[1:21:52] Sebleh: so it could literally be weekly if she actually does that
[1:21:56] Sebleh: every week*
[1:22:01] TotallyNotRaien: big If
[1:22:10] Andersonmps: 300 euros is a investment. But you will have a awesome mic not only for cooking streams, but externals too

[1:23:05] YionLi94: Where are the promised high keys LUL KEKW
[1:23:07] Sebleh: wireless would always be on you
[1:23:08] Aegatron: why not :)
[1:23:18] Jack_the_Dipper: Shotgun is great for a direction of sound input when there is a distance
[1:23:18] Andersonmps: Good point sableh
[1:23:29] Sebleh: don’t say that
[1:23:40] Sebleh: she will start ignoring you if she thinks you like my ifeas
[1:23:45] Sebleh: ideas
[1:23:48] Andersonmps: LUL
[1:23:55] Aegatron: im afraid with those kind of stuff... you can be a bit... clumsy Caro
[1:23:58] chimneybob: convenient i agree
[1:24:08] chimneybob: things can get cumbersome with all the gear
[1:24:10] Jack_the_Dipper: I sometimes see streamers use a Shure SM7B as a long distance shotgun mic LUL
[1:24:12] sim967: what's the hesitation?
[1:24:13] TotallyNotRaien: @aegatron dont worry shell solder it
[1:24:28] Andersonmps: I think the rode wireless is the best option
[1:24:31] Aegatron: @TotallyNotRaien ye that worked out well
[1:24:40] liammarson7: Hey, what’s the benefit to go from toxic boots + patch to double blue silken lining?? I assume you only use it for M+ too??
[1:24:49] Sebleh: naguuraSip
[1:25:14] Sebleh: okay but think about this, if you go the clip on mic you have to remember to bring the batteries. can you do that? seblehHmm

[1:26:17] Aegatron: rkayThink mhm

[1:26:29] Kuroz: there's 2 on amazon.com too, it was in the cam article too
[1:26:32] Kuroz: for 169
[1:26:36] Sebleh: my Amazon showed two as well
[1:26:43] Kuroz: https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Wireless-Single-Channel-Microphone/dp/B09PXCZ247/?tag=6890-20
[1:27:41] Andersonmps: Te oficial site says Operating Time is Up to 7 hours
[1:27:55] Kuroz: the italian amazon prices are a bit all over the place
[1:28:03] Sebleh: it says 7 hours
[1:28:06] Kuroz: so it's private shops selling on amazon
[1:28:06] Sebleh: for a full charge
[1:28:41] Kuroz: hmmMeeting  technically
[1:29:33] Sebleh: maybe you can get a second battery tho
[1:29:47] Andersonmps: See the specifications here -> https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelessgoii
[1:30:37] Sebleh: oh yeah you’re right the batteries are not replaceable

[1:31:07] Sebleh: the replacement batteries have leads for soldering lol
[1:31:24] Sebleh: I would say you buy the double if you plan to go for longer than 5-6hours with it
[1:31:35] Jack_the_Dipper: The EU is working a on a law that hardware companies need to make the hardware with the ability to replace batteries
[1:31:43] Sebleh: but that’s on what your use plans are
[1:31:49] Aegatron: EZ

[1:33:27] SyckJabbo: peer pressure buy!!
[1:33:31] zeestary: What u think of changes main? Are u more bound to one character or no problem to switch?  It is very difficult for me to decide.  Because I have everything on that character. But hunter is not very good for m+ and raid.
[1:33:33] Andersonmps: what do you mean?
[1:33:45] Sebleh: I’ve got no horse in this race I just think it’s a solid solution if you want to invest in it for whatever you end up doing with it.
[1:34:00] Almadovar: What is she using to stream on two platdorms if I may ask
[1:34:03] sim967: it seems like a good investment for her

[1:44:30] Sebleh: the weight is the main thing

[1:45:45] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and 10.2 guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:45:49] Sebleh: and the receiver is probably chunky too

[1:46:34] Jack_the_Dipper: sell it LUL
[1:46:38] Aegatron: :p
[1:46:42] Andersonmps: The reciever go on the camera, and the transmitter (wich is the mic) go on you
[1:46:44] Kuroz: the quality is fine as I would say during a cooking stream, someone in chat will disagree
[1:46:49] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[1:46:53] Andersonmps: Its wirelless
[1:47:01] Sebleh: it’s been in your face, I’m sure someone in chat will buy it PepeLaugh

[1:47:46] Andersonmps: What i mean that it will be way less weight on you
[1:47:58] Andersonmps: Only the mic will be on you
[1:48:52] Andersonmps: I understand
[1:48:52] Sebleh: this started as talking about if the wireless mic had replaceable batteries it would be heavier and hanging from your shirt would be a bit much naguuraSip
[1:49:39] Andersonmps: I man. I usually get bothered with wires and cables
[1:49:45] Andersonmps: on me
[1:49:57] Sebleh: NODDERS
[1:50:09] Andersonmps: @Andersonmps mean*
[1:50:18] Sebleh: the main downside is the mic sucks on the easy battery replacement one
[1:50:42] Sebleh: but maybe you can find something similar quality to the rode with replaceable batteries
[1:50:45] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and 10.2 guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:50:57] Andersonmps: Maybe a con interview
[1:51:08] Sebleh: I know Midna wanted the wireless because she likes to wear dresses and doesn’t really want something hanging from her
[1:51:47] Andersonmps: You can use the mic onm the phone
[1:51:50] Andersonmps: yes
[1:52:05] Sebleh: tru

[1:54:29] y0rge: cus it is 200$ mic
[1:54:34] Andersonmps: @y0rge yup
[1:54:36] Keyalish: expensive but sounds a lot better
[1:55:01] LesterOfSmeg2: better mic

[1:55:49] mika01: a wireless cable naguuraPanda
[1:55:49] Sebleh: you heard Midna’s that’s just the microphone
[1:55:53] y0rge: you coudl just get good mic to your current transmiter

[1:56:39] y0rge: yep
[1:56:43] Sebleh: yeah trye
[1:56:46] Sebleh: true*
[1:56:56] Andersonmps: Thats true too
[1:57:34] Sebleh: this rode one sounds like an investment if you want to do more stuff specially with your phone as you said
[1:57:35] y0rge: you can even plug better mic to your phone
[1:57:37] Sneakyodin: as long as it is compatible and it can deal with the inputs from the microphone in a good format
[1:57:38] y0rge: foir better audio
[1:57:40] Andersonmps: But for me the wireless aspect and the versatility are the winning factors to me
[1:57:46] LesterOfSmeg2: WHat onedoes ANnnie have when she does IRL streams it was pretty good sound
[1:57:51] Sebleh: dude go for it. get the Rode and force yourself to do outdoorsy phone streams
[1:57:52] y0rge: you dont need 300$ rode
[1:57:53] Sebleh: seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk

[1:58:44] Little_Dippin: true, ty!
[1:58:57] Kuroz: can also wait for the other one you ordered first and then decide if that one is worth
[1:59:16] Sebleh: but for kitchen streams with the wireless you will never be out of range of the mic
[1:59:39] Andersonmps: @Sebleh NODDERS
[1:59:39] Im_Guu: Shotgun mics work really well once properly set, I use at work on a training desk.
[1:59:48] y0rge: just look for good quality shirt clip mic and you w ill be fine
[1:59:53] tea2468: will the kitchen stream be a thing soon *.*
[1:59:57] Sebleh: I’m saying it’s a plus
[1:59:59] y0rge: even look on that for 189 from that rode clip
[2:00:09] Andersonmps: @tea2468 its alread is
[2:00:17] tea2468: oh when?
[2:00:41] Sebleh: My point is just that you can use it on your phone for vlogging or hiking or whatever streams and you can also use it for kitchen streams and a benefit is you are never out of range of the mic, one less sound issue.

[2:01:05] tea2468: yum
[2:01:10] notabes: ALOO
[2:01:13] tea2468: cinnamon rolls too?
[2:01:23] Sebleh: but like I said at the nd of the day you do what you want to do. if you think you can make the shotgun mic work for other phone streams or vlog then solid you got it covered with that
[2:01:58] Im_Guu: @Sebleh this is also true, shotgun mics are highly directional, and if you move slightly they do not pickup well
[2:02:23] Andersonmps: Decisions, decisions!
[2:02:23] Sebleh: ThumbsUpCat
[2:02:33] Sebleh: ok

[2:02:48] notabes: Kitchen ASMR streams? Kappa
[2:03:17] Kuroz: the mic cutting out for 2 seconds while talking about mics
[2:03:21] imagamerbby: the irony (did audio cut for anyone else?)
[2:03:22] Kuroz: Chatting
[2:03:23] bjorn_312: why is maintenance so long today? D:
[2:03:31] Andersonmps: LMAO
[2:03:43] Andersonmps: @bjorn_312 new patch
[2:04:00] Im_Guu: Most shotgun mics are super narrow pickup patterns
[2:04:00] y0rge: ask yourself how much you will use it
[2:04:03] y0rge: rode is liek 300
[2:04:10] y0rge: good quality mic ~200
[2:04:11] Im_Guu: which one did you get? can take a look
[2:04:15] AilPail: PrideHeartL PrideHeartR rhoxyHi
[2:04:30] notabes: You're proper buying the apartment? That's nice! naguuraFeelsGood
[2:04:51] Andersonmps: All the ups and downs are on the table. Now its you that decide
[2:05:41] Sebleh: I think the issue with just replacing the wired transmitter mic is that you won’t be able to use it with your phone no? so then you’re having to get something else for that and like the shotgun mic it really only works for kitchen streams.

[2:06:20] nevernude1: Yea they have different feature, You might be able to compare them on the rode website

[2:07:27] Andersonmps: Only 2
[2:07:40] JPBMDC: @xjustcloudz no thats fine tbh
[2:07:41] nevernude1: Is this for your kitchen stream?
[2:07:44] Sebleh: no
[2:07:46] notabes: Stremer doesn't know how long she's live HUH
[2:07:47] Sebleh: this is a mic stream
[2:07:52] Sebleh: always has been naguuraDreadlord

[2:08:20] xjustcloudz: @JPBMDC people keep telling me im too low to join them tho
[2:08:21] sim967: so buy a phone mic
[2:08:22] y0rge: you can get usb c jack adapter
[2:08:29] Im_Guu: buyer's remorse even before buying :(
[2:08:42] Andersonmps: Dont be persuaded by us, If you think that you dont need it.
[2:08:50] Sebleh: but you don’t have to buy it right away either naguuraSip
[2:09:53] Sebleh: clearly just ping Rode on Twitter and demand a sponsorship

[2:10:26] Im_Guu: both xD
[2:10:31] sim967: you've been doing more non-gaming content honestly, I feel like a phone mic is a good investment
[2:10:34] Andersonmps: I think its a mix of both
[2:10:39] Sebleh: @im_guu seblehHey

[2:11:29] Sebleh: you can just solder a better mic into the transmitter duh
[2:11:29] Kuroz: omg I can't listen to this
[2:11:31] Jack_the_Dipper: monkaS
[2:11:33] Im_Guu: go with amazon you can always return it
[2:11:36] sim967: you've said that before
[2:11:39] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[2:11:46] Im_Guu: just make the stream shortly after getting it
[2:11:55] Andersonmps: i mean. You saw that girl clip earlier. That sounded amazing
[2:12:00] Sebleh: then you give Johnny the wireless and you stand by the mic at the desk
[2:12:02] nevernude1: When mic dies, Kuroz can lip read and transcribe everything
[2:12:18] Sebleh: all I’m saying is there’s probably more uses than you’re considering
[2:12:43] Sebleh: special streams, with or without Johnny, cooking streams, the Christmas tree, any vlogging, a phone stream or vlog
[2:12:44] Andersonmps: Think on all that with calm.
