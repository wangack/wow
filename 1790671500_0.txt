[2:36:24] Herzenliegen: Disney is super fun.
[2:36:58] Ithylz: Disney have triple their prices in 10 years in Europe
[2:37:09] Lexxania: you only live once might as well enjoy yourself along the way
[2:37:24] Thoreya: disney in orlando is pretty dope too. epcot is the shit

[2:37:57] ArcaneSyntax: My buddy in Florida literally has a season pass just to eat there during the week.
[2:38:02] XennoTehRogue: they have those at schlitterbahn. worth it, fuck waaiting in line even in the morning
[2:38:03] Herzenliegen: @Ithylz That's why they all fly to Disney World in FL
[2:38:27] xFirebloodx: interesting
[2:38:28] Jewishraver: @XennoTehRogue that shit was the best park i ever been to in my adult life. 10/10 would do again
[2:38:37] Stellioni: Im on a mission! #giveus10manmythicraid
[2:38:59] XennoTehRogue: @Jewishraver i live 45 minutes from it so i get a pass every year, worth it imo
[2:39:09] packetsv1: whats that addon you are using when in premade groups
[2:39:31] Ithylz: @Herzenliegen Considering the prices Towelliee  just talked about + the flight, it would be more expensive to go to Florida instead of France if you're European
[2:39:57] Ch0p_Su3y: Many ppl would love 10m mythic raiding tho.. for small groups would be a dream
[2:40:00] Thoreya: @Ithylz cali and florida different
[2:40:14] Herzenliegen: @Ithylz He's going to Disneyland. Believe it or not Disney World is much cheaper
[2:40:37] Ithylz: Ah y, DIsney world, my bad
[2:40:57] PvtHudson093: WoW has  too many specs and classes to do 10 man Mythic
[2:41:04] ArcaneSyntax: 10 man mythic would be a nightmare with all the raid buffs
[2:41:04] Ch0p_Su3y: maybe 15m is half-way of todays and the "dream"

[2:42:28] Zolshy89: 10 man isnt enough for all buffs in the game

[2:43:14] Thoreya: evoker shaman dk hunter left out
[2:43:28] wuhuzuhu: only for min max guys back in cata i raided with tight friends we didnt care which class only fun..
[2:43:54] Ch0p_Su3y: cuz is a pain to find good 20m or to be picked for a group.. also to coordinate 20m of unknown and bitching players, quite stressful.. this gameplay has been for a very few cluster of players, at least to me, for the last 4 expansions
[2:44:26] Denohar: i miss the buff scrolls
[2:45:06] alb1nn0: scrolls need to come back i agree @Denohar
[2:45:06] ArcaneSyntax: @wuhuzuhu you can still play that way only on normal and heroic.
[2:45:51] Ithylz: They would prob remove the raid buffs but the weird thing would be mechanics where you have a certain number of players targeted. Imagine RWF with 2 debuffs + 40% of a 3rd debuff as in flex raids :D
[2:45:52] Ch0p_Su3y: cross-realm guilds may save that issue
