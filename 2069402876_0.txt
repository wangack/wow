[0:13:48] JarJar_Brinkz: Was that a manticore
[0:14:04] magemaster225: must be an art spell
[0:14:05] thunduz: not that I got
[0:14:42] TankenFunk: I considered myself done with Elden Ring, but this will pull me right back in
[0:15:24] thunduz: more Blaidd please
[0:15:59] JarJar_Brinkz: Honestly the playerbase averages for Elden Ring are insane for a generally single player/story based game
[0:16:16] Teth33: Teth33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! First stream I've been able to catch in a bit. Happy Wednesday!
[0:16:32] JarJar_Brinkz: Yeah true LUL
[0:16:49] Fibnkak: wait the war within is dead
[0:16:54] TankenFunk: Elden Ring player base drops by 90%?!?!?! (after 4 months) | DEAD GAME | Must Watch
[0:17:00] JarJar_Brinkz: STRAIGHT INTO SoD Kappa
[0:17:15] databob1: NO DON'T JUMP!!!
[0:17:36] eternitycrystal: you can now farm your leg weap, it has much bigger drop chance. Or is the priest the char you only play?
[0:17:47] Kardall: omg This week is going to be like Christmas!
[0:17:52] Xephur123: Looks like you have Jaina caged in the back tneEvi
[0:18:07] HeyheyReirei: had two looted last night in raid
[0:18:09] blumberquack: Ye they buffed the embers apparently
[0:18:10] handovdoom666: i saw a screenshot where 5 people in one raid got the legendary
[0:18:14] Kardall: 7800 XT coming by Friday, a guy dropping off 3 Dell servers for $80 CAD and Last Epoch releases in 2 hours!
[0:18:14] eternitycrystal: yea a blue post about that came forth, you can check it on wowhead
[0:18:43] Kardall: Last Epoch is amazing
[0:18:51] JarJar_Brinkz: Nightingale looks good to me
[0:18:58] Kardall: ya I don't like survival games really so
[0:19:14] Fibnkak: you knbwo what the truly Legendary weapon is the shaman one becasue no one has it. it's only a thing of legends
[0:19:14] Kardall: exactly
[0:19:16] Repurge: had 5 drop on my raid last night. everyone but me :’(
[0:19:19] Nulgar: test test, video not loading, are we live yet?
[0:19:20] mattyxoqt: so many games not enough time
[0:19:20] Repurge: one day…
[0:19:23] JarJar_Brinkz: I initially thought it was a story based game, kinda disappointed it is survival
[0:19:26] Teth33: Last Epoch is great. I've been in early access for a few years.
[0:19:35] Nulgar: ah, now I have video
[0:19:45] blumberquack: @Kardall I've tried it, seems great but it's a lil too clunky for me rn, hoping 1.0 will polish it up a bit more
[0:20:16] Nulgar: oh noooo
[0:20:18] JarJar_Brinkz: LMAOOOOO
[0:20:18] Kardall: Ya it is like a beefed up Diablo, similar but less complex than PoE
[0:20:19] mattyxoqt: All his videos a bait
[0:20:20] Teth33: It's an ARPG, made by fans. Started on reddit just asking what people would like if they could make their perfect ARPG
[0:20:23] JarJar_Brinkz: Editors did an oopsie
[0:20:24] eternitycrystal: no asmon comments, he is the last guy I would listen to
[0:20:24] magemaster225: yeah its an arpg, its like a middle ground between D4 and PoE
[0:20:32] keyboardturner: The Last Titan is dead
[0:20:35] keyboardturner: Kappa
[0:20:37] starthorium: its sort of an inebtween of diablo 4 and path of exile crom a build craft and difficulty standpoint
[0:20:46] Nulgar: setting up new phones in our network, haven't done that before, scary but interesting
[0:20:46] krisz49: Last epoch is like Diablo4 and PoE had a baby, its more complex than Diablo, but less complex than PoE
[0:20:52] Fibnkak: the real war within was the ceos we left behind. in mircosoft
[0:20:57] JarJar_Brinkz: I never believe "game made by fans" or "game made by gamers"
[0:20:58] FatCatDad48: It's like a spiritual successor to Diablo 2
[0:20:59] thunduz: Dub Dub is dead already? I didn’t even get to enjoy it
[0:21:05] JarJar_Brinkz: everyone is a fan and a gamer, that's not doing much these days
[0:21:06] Saiyori: Morning everyone
[0:21:16] Kardall: ya you never really see your character up close
[0:21:17] wanik90: Last epoch gone woke?!?!
[0:21:21] Nulgar: look, he's getting older, you have limited facial expressions then
[0:21:22] thunduz: not a game for me
[0:21:27] krisz49: check the new updated trailer
[0:21:44] Blighthung: Hello world
[0:21:54] Nulgar: the UI looks very... "Diablo-'inspired' "
[0:22:07] whisperlude: if i wanted to play diablo, id just play diablo...
[0:22:19] gsrasslan: What is this whole "the war within is dead" thing? Are people really saying that?
[0:22:32] JarJar_Brinkz: @gsrasslan Somewhere probably
[0:22:35] eternitycrystal: void? well that's ffrom wow
[0:22:39] SphericFormula: @gsrasslan asmon clickbait nonsense
[0:22:51] HSAyril: @jarjar_brinkz just the regular doomsayers
[0:22:59] floatinging: What seems exciting about this game is the crafting system. Has some good quality of life stuff, Darth Microtransaction has a great video as usual about it
[0:23:00] thunduz: Eterna is dying?! Epoach really is dead game
[0:23:02] eternitycrystal: @gsrasslan just ignore it's just some losers comment
[0:23:07] Teth33: It's a time travelling story where things you do in one era have results in another. Really fun gameplay.
[0:23:19] mattyxoqt: she looks cool
[0:23:22] Kardall: ya there's definitely some classes that play better than others, but diablo is the same way so
[0:23:23] JarJar_Brinkz: Well the game obviously looks much better because Blizzard didn't make it, so that takes it from a 5 to a 9 automatically
[0:23:51] Nulgar: very repetitive music, at least on my headphones
[0:24:07] thunduz: Tali, now look up the paw patrol game. End game is where it gets really insane hard mode!
[0:24:10] Teth33: Another good thing is all builds are viable and you can respec easily.
[0:24:18] Nulgar: Time travel story? Yeah these always go over well...
[0:24:27] JarJar_Brinkz: All builds will never be viable unless the game is easy as hell
[0:24:28] JarJar_Brinkz: lets be real

[0:25:02] krisz49: problem with release its on raid reset day :D
[0:25:06] thunduz: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco
[0:25:23] grumpy_dan: either all builds are viable or builds matter. you cant have both i think
[0:25:28] Teth33: Well not *all* but the game encourages you to try out different combos. And things are pretty intuitive where you put your points.
[0:26:17] trollbrand: tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo tneGo
[0:26:20] Teth33: There will be a meta, of course, but every ability has it's use and you can play how you want and be successful.
[0:26:48] the_howlermonkey: the_howlermonkey subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Steve rules, Metzen drools
[0:26:51] vlaovich88: Viable is different than good. You can finish the game with any build but some will be way better than others.
[0:27:24] revan4686: revan4686 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to TaliesinAndEvitel's community! They've gifted a total of 115 in the channel! 
[0:27:25] revan4686: revan4686 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Crossos98! 
[0:27:53] TankenFunk: You can play the shittiest worst build of all time in Elden Ring and it's still okay, cause you can just be better
[0:27:55] Teth33: The guy who built their auction/trading post system is former Blizz and was part of the big AH revamp seen in DF.
[0:27:56] JarJar_Brinkz: Lets click on  LAST EPOCH END GAME ITS...
[0:27:57] vlaovich88: Yep! Totally agreeing with you. Part of the fun of single player games is playing bad builds and still finishing
[0:28:07] bladestitch: What a weird topic I just entered too...
[0:28:14] ramzie0: A dex wizard in BG3 might not be "viable" lol
[0:28:15] Reminii91: Hey Mr. TaLi, how's the roof?
[0:28:24] riciouskain: Impossible to balance in wow cuz if a spec is ahead by 1% the community will deem it viable
[0:28:32] Thoreya: @bladestitch whats weird about it? lol
[0:28:35] JarJar_Brinkz: Its viable on explorer mode
[0:28:49] Fibnkak: a dex wizard going first all the time yes please
[0:28:54] cosmopanda13: it's always weird to me because if you check the leaderboards in wow there are players of every spec doing M+30
[0:29:00] kinslayerneko: dex is like a secondary stat for casters anyway
[0:29:13] SphericFormula: Have we watched Elden Ring trailer on stream yet?
[0:29:16] TankenFunk: Dex wiz, high AC, high initiative, blast them all to death before they can even move
[0:29:19] hexen109: Dex Wizard is viable, you can use the Periapt of Intelligence to offset
[0:29:20] Teth33: Monk/Wizard playthrough when?
[0:29:25] Togglegoggle: elf wizard with a bow and spells that dont have saves, sounds good to me
[0:29:25] JarJar_Brinkz: @cosmopanda13 But you need to look at how many of each, everything CAN do it, but if there's 50 of one, and 2 of another.. well
[0:29:41] Durwen: look for builds
[0:29:43] kinslayerneko: we call them arcane tricksters
[0:30:06] Teth33: Mage/Thief was a powerful combo back in the old 2nd Ed days.
[0:30:19] hexen109: BG3 has items that can offset your stats, so it is viable
[0:30:22] TankenFunk: Also, if you go DEX on a wiz, that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your INT, you can still get 18/18 DEX and INT pretty fast
[0:30:23] netonkent: Magic archer
[0:30:35] Fibnkak: eldrich knight is a dex wizard
[0:30:40] ramzie0: Rip me, senpai notices my pre-coffee shitpost
[0:30:44] kinslayerneko: the only builds that aren't viable are builds that fail the DPS check
[0:31:14] hexen109: D&D 5th edition has very little "unviable" things
[0:31:35] hexen109: Someone completed BG3 using weaponized Gnomes
[0:31:38] ShadowDragon14855: Morning all
[0:31:51] JarJar_Brinkz: I always thought true strike looked a bit horrible LUL
[0:32:21] Togglegoggle: i liked the bg3 cat only playthrough. completing the entire game as a druid in cat form.
[0:32:34] JMan31337: single player has no enrage timer
[0:32:35] JarJar_Brinkz: @Togglegoggle LUL
[0:32:49] Fibnkak: DPs is only how long my SpL (seconds per life is)
[0:32:55] hexen109: if WoW let you stack defenses like BG3 does, to the point of ignoring mechanics, then it'd be viable
[0:32:56] kinslayerneko: is it a DPS check if they can just flail through it though?
[0:33:05] hexen109: the problem is bypassing mechanics
[0:33:16] Fibnkak: @kinslayerneko yes
[0:33:19] Durwen: conversely, you apparently can't complete the game as a cat
[0:33:45] elbardo_ts: are you going to do the salami run?
[0:33:50] MxViolet: MxViolet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 1 month streak! What are you and Evi going to play in your next Baldur's Gate Live Stream run? :D
[0:33:51] JarJar_Brinkz: ARPG games get extra love anytime they release, I take my time before considering them
[0:33:53] kinslayerneko: I consider a dps check a check that ends your game when you can't pass it.
[0:34:04] Teth33: Let's just say there is quite a bit of build diversity, especially compared to D4. Also, you can't brick your character by putting in wrong skill points like PoE, so you can freely experiment.
[0:34:06] mattyxoqt: please do i fkn love baldurs gate
[0:34:25] Fibnkak: A hard core Salami run is just tail visting italy in speedo only
[0:34:27] thunduz: she’s made the right choice
[0:34:29] magemaster225: have you done the split screen, just curious if its viable
[0:34:38] MxViolet: My wife and I have been doing a couch coop campaign and it looks SO good on TV!
[0:34:56] elbardo_ts: have you done the 1 level on every class?
[0:35:13] thunduz: My oldest and I have a campaign started.
[0:35:15] TankenFunk: Split screen is not viable, as non-split screen will increase your player perception by about 1%, making it the optimal play, therefore, split screen is not viable in this meta
[0:35:17] Mythridates: Mythridates subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:35:20] TankenFunk: check mate Kappa
[0:35:47] Mythridates: join on the Last Epoch hype it's way better than D4
[0:35:49] Durwen: I fully intend to cheese my honor run
[0:35:58] xd_pad: I felt griefed
[0:36:00] thunduz: that sounds terrible
[0:36:01] JMan31337: any idea what is up with blizzard doing server restarts every day?
[0:36:33] Teth33: I still play D4. It's fun to pop in for the season, get some rewards, then set it aside for a couple of months.
[0:36:36] saarkhastick: There's a bad echo on Karlach. Anyone else hear it?
[0:36:40] Fibnkak: I lost my current Hard mode run thinking i could take on the duegar and nere.  I can say it was not worth it and next time they can rot there alone
[0:36:40] MxViolet: I knew I was never going to regrind D4 infinitely. Diablo has been a great story RPG for me
[0:36:43] JarJar_Brinkz: Anytime a random game pops up and gets this much hype, I'm wary of it
[0:36:46] Teth33: I plan on playing Last Epoch the same way.
[0:36:50] krisz49: I enjoyed D4 campaign
[0:36:52] netonkent: You going to play dragons dogma 2?
[0:36:52] Mythridates: D4 is fine but the seasonal content is lackluster
[0:37:00] Nerraw3: 100% with you on D4 - fun for a bit and good story, then it fell off
[0:37:01] thunduz: have they spoken about the DLC for D4 since Blizzcon?
[0:37:03] krisz49: yeah there is an acho
[0:37:03] Rico_Azzarash: Yup. There was an echo
[0:37:05] Deralis: I also enjoyed D4 campaign
[0:37:06] krisz49: *echo
[0:37:07] TankenFunk: Echo on sub notifications, yes. I think chat is just too shy to tell you tneEvi
[0:37:17] mrmanno14: how far did you get in SoD yesterday? I had to bounce 10 mins in
[0:37:18] ItsLtLavender: yep to the echo

[0:38:01] JarJar_Brinkz: Oh god now its 4 echos Kappa
[0:38:25] Rico_Azzarash: I was testing an echo

[0:42:42] rowanoaken: Don't be sorry - you carried me through that Waycrest Manor yesterday and I got some great gear from it - I'm trying to be a better pally! You're the best tneEviHeart
[0:43:06] MxViolet: they are hideous lol
[0:43:17] mrmanno14: Trump and FOMO smh
[0:43:20] Rico_Azzarash: new merch from Evi? T&E shoes?
[0:43:21] mattyxoqt: are the shoes to help him pay his court fees
[0:43:23] aeson_of_raid_sock: sold out like trump
[0:43:36] Fibnkak: yea they are "sold out"  i have heard of money laundering too
[0:43:57] Mythridates: Tali hates political talks. FACTS
[0:43:58] Saevash: Heya Myff!!
[0:44:05] MxViolet: oh his zombies have absolutely bought his gawdy gold shoes
[0:44:09] Saiyori: I call turning my pandaria farm plants into living steel money laundering
[0:44:14] aeson_of_raid_sock: let’s have commie talk
[0:44:16] gsrasslan: the trump shoes gives such vanilla ice energy
[0:44:18] Triskelian: @fibnkak Of course they are, those and the Trump NFTs
[0:44:21] literally_human_garbage: no doubt in my mind his supporters are dumb enough to fall for literally all of his schemes
[0:44:28] bladestitch: Don't think they'll get the shoes.
[0:44:30] mattyxoqt: I think everyone in that kinda circle does some shady shit

[0:44:35] JarJar_Brinkz: Im gonna die laughing if i see a 70 year old walking around in those
[0:44:38] Reminii91: his base and the smart fool who're gonna sell this off for x100 price
[0:44:39] MxViolet: The people who have made "America" their personality see Trump as their mascot
[0:44:41] vlaovich88: It is quick cash because he needs access to liquid cash with the NYS fines.
[0:44:43] icycoolfresh: Tali, idk if you know but ben shapiro was in a white supremacists' music video
[0:44:48] keyboardturner: tali supports trump 2024 confirmed Kappa
[0:44:53] rowanoaken: As much as I hate Trump, I can't even fathom Joe Biden releasing merch like that - Trump is on it
[0:44:58] Shirey12: Hey Tali did you see the video " I never played WoW, So I tried all of them (a lot)" by J1mmy?
[0:45:04] thunduz: I just got me some X-men shoes instead of
[0:45:05] icycoolfresh: Music video, I think he raps lmao
[0:45:09] TollBoothVideos: Oh that J1mmy vid was fire
[0:45:11] MrScotticus: Every Ben Shapiro video is a white supremacist video by definition
[0:45:12] mrmanno14: That was the cringiest rap video
[0:45:25] aeson_of_raid_sock: every Ben Shapiro video is a white supremacist video
[0:45:34] Fibnkak: I just want to know when the gold plated trump ar-15 with t-45 on the side will be on sale
[0:45:41] Triskelian: @rowanoaken That's because Biden has better taste than Trump
[0:46:01] icycoolfresh: Lmfao
[0:46:01] maulinx: lmfao
[0:46:01] MxViolet: LOL
[0:46:03] keyboardturner: LuL
[0:46:06] eternitycrystal: he didn't even made max char on dragonflight so his opinions are useless
[0:46:12] SquiggySquonk: tneEvi
[0:46:12] CeasiusPls: icecream
[0:46:13] keyboardturner: they're all old
[0:46:16] icycoolfresh: tneTaliWasRight
[0:46:16] MxViolet: my hero
[0:46:33] HSAyril: Can we not have 80yos as our two candidates to choose from..
[0:46:40] Fibnkak: oh i forgot to ask have you talked to the kids about a futrue dog yet?
[0:46:42] Reminii91: are Jon Stewart's bothsiding Tali :D :D :D ?
[0:46:48] mrmanno14: Did you see the beginning of Bellular's new villain arc where he was associated with Asmongold's video "The War Within is Dead"?
[0:46:51] SphericFormula: @eternitycrystal who?
[0:46:51] gsrasslan: Both Trump and Biden are setting a new record for oldest ever presidential candidate....  A record they themselves set in 2020
[0:47:26] Fibnkak: new player experience is the new gatekeeping in wow
[0:47:30] aeson_of_raid_sock: we figured it out because we’re chads
[0:47:30] eternitycrystal: players should learn the game, it's like eve online. WoW is not mario
[0:47:46] JarJar_Brinkz: I genuinely believe the reason the leveling system is not good for new players now, is because old players always complain incorrectly FOR the new players
[0:47:54] keyboardturner: I think if there's one main primary thing I'd improve is to put professions a little bit more out there and in front of you, fishing and cooking pair very nicely and it'd be a nice thing for a player to get into
[0:47:57] rowanoaken: Okay, but my 56 y/o dad who has played since Classic was so bamboozled by Dragonflight - all of the mandatory quests when he hit 70... I had to help him out :')
[0:48:01] Teth33: We really need to work on the "new player endgame" experience, but you have talked about that a lot.
[0:48:07] eternitycrystal: I did
[0:48:07] Syllvn: Nope
[0:48:19] netonkent: I'm not a new player but I had a break from tbc until shadowlands, and returning was amazing so much content
[0:48:19] MxViolet: lol I played in vanilla but didnt get to max level until Wrath XD
[0:48:19] tarnishedvalor: i did...but it was vanilla so that doesn't count?
[0:48:21] SphericFormula: I did not - it was vanilla and I was a child :D
[0:48:22] YlaWoW: My first char had fishing max before they got max lvl
[0:48:23] bladestitch: Don't remember. Old and played classic.
[0:48:23] Togglegoggle: i feel like the introduction of chromie time is the most confusing thing for new players.
[0:48:24] aeson_of_raid_sock: I started before expansions
[0:48:24] blumberquack: ...I would've been around 7 years old then? LUL
[0:48:26] icycoolfresh: I just got 60 at the end of vanilla
[0:48:26] TollBoothVideos: Does it take someone more than an expac to get to max??
[0:48:28] chico_escuela: highest I got in vanilla was 56
[0:48:28] HeyheyReirei: took all of BC to hit max just in time for wrath :)
[0:48:29] saarkhastick: Yes
[0:48:33] Mythridates: i started late TBC and by the time i subbed after the trial WoLK was out
[0:48:34] keyboardturner: I did but it was very, very late
[0:48:34] soltiro: Does prepatch count has the new or old expac
[0:48:40] xd_pad: I leveled as a holy priest in BC. I was in high school so every night and weekend I was grinding
[0:48:40] Sikuq: yes
[0:48:41] JarJar_Brinkz: 20 year old vets should NOT be the ones trying to change the leveling experience for new players imo
[0:48:41] Bjerreh: technically yes, started tbc pre-patch
[0:48:42] HSAyril: The racial starting areas teaches nothing about the basic of basics, I imagine it'd be daunting to start a game and that teaches you nothing at the beginning m
[0:48:45] Nulgar: Vanilla, yes
[0:48:47] AssumptionPrime: I started in Vanilla, and did hit 60
[0:48:48] xAHOMAJIu9Ix: Is privat servers counts?
[0:48:50] bladestitch: Should be an option "don't remember"
[0:48:58] chryseis: Yes, but it was BFA during lockdown so I had lots of time lol
[0:48:59] witcherpie: a better question  would be if we got into endgame content or just did leveling
[0:49:00] rowanoaken: Okay, but how far into Wrath were you when you started the game?
[0:49:03] schlakt: started in vanilla so obv not i was like 9
[0:49:03] Nulgar: but I did quit for several months after, until BC came out
[0:49:04] Teth33: I started at the end of BC, but was 63 when Wrath launched.
[0:49:04] ronconi: i did but i started in BFA
[0:49:05] xAHOMAJIu9Ix: then yes
[0:49:05] eternitycrystal: I started in BC I played like crazy because I was/am still in love with the game
[0:49:08] literally_human_garbage: I started in Wrath and I think I didn't hit max until MoP actually. I wasn't playing regularly back then and in Cata I made a Worgen and ignored my previous main
[0:49:08] TollBoothVideos: I started in BC and got to max level on 2 characters
[0:49:11] saarkhastick: Started in Vanilla
[0:49:17] Jehugasm: started in vanilla, got 60 just after TBC came out
[0:49:21] TollBoothVideos: how much?
[0:49:23] Saiyori: I did, started in late cata
[0:49:31] Triskelian: @ronconi Same here
[0:49:43] soltiro: Started in cata prepatch and got to max level halfway through cata, during 4.1 I think
[0:49:47] schlakt: started in vanilla didnt get Max level until cata haha
[0:49:47] einomar: I started in TBC and reach max in TBC. I managed to raid Karazan before wotlk came out xD.
[0:49:55] tarnishedvalor: the poll is skewed because it seems like most of us were vanilla'rs
[0:50:00] Durwen: Uh... I can't remember, TH
[0:50:05] Saiyori: well, if they dont fast track you, you miss out on all the fomo
[0:50:09] bucephalos: max lvl is heavily connected to the seasonal model of wow
[0:50:10] Elgefar: got max level in vanilla, BC came out a week later and then I maxed in BC and quit after three weeks. funsies
[0:50:17] ramzie0: I didn't reach max level in the current expansion until Wrath
[0:50:18] icycoolfresh: As a vanilla stan, I miss the leveling grind
[0:50:18] i_identify_as_a_mistake: Well i said yes, But i never played mist of kung fu panda ^^
[0:50:22] keyboardturner: idk how like 9 year old me managed to get max level in tbc
[0:50:24] Zambrakk: If I convince one of my mates to play, I don't want them to be on their own for a year when they could be in M+ with me
[0:50:36] Saiyori: Path of the Curator strikes again
[0:50:52] rowanoaken: I don't care about the time it takes - but it just needs more streamlining... like your idea about the expansion playthrough and making quests when you hit 70 chronological and not a mess in Valdrakken
[0:50:52] icycoolfresh: tneTaliWasRight
[0:50:58] starthorium: what are you thoughts about including raids in that process
[0:51:00] bladestitch: There's a youtuber (Roox) who tried out wow and it's a joy to watch him explore. :)
[0:51:04] ramzie0: Wait, what's path of the curator?
[0:51:05] mrmanno14: which should include a raid from that expansion
[0:51:14] Triskelian: @saiyori We all knew that's where this was headed
[0:51:19] Durwen: Path of the Curator, DRINK!
[0:51:19] chryseis: That kiiiind of happened pre-chromie time
[0:51:25] Saiyori: @Triskelian 100%. I still love the idea
[0:51:35] JarJar_Brinkz: I think it exists because so many vets complain for new players, when the new players don't need it
[0:51:44] HSAyril: Probably easier to do one starting area than make the starting area foe each race
[0:51:56] jawea: but they made an achievement of it
[0:52:07] Triskelian: @saiyori Same. It feels a lot better than Chromie 5ime
[0:52:13] JarJar_Brinkz: Yep
[0:52:16] gryffiest: I think we need to see your brother do a legacy starting area for a vid xD
[0:52:17] eternitycrystal: I play WoW now for 15 years I don't care about the new players we also learned the hard way
[0:52:18] Togglegoggle: exiles reach feels a little too much like "baby's first video game"
[0:52:23] AssumptionPrime: I introduced a friend to wow recently, and she did not like Exile's Reach. She wanted to play her race's starter zone and learn about the world
[0:52:26] bottis96: STARTER AREAS ARE SET UP TO SPEED AN ALT TO MAX LEVEL
[0:52:31] Synth_San: I recently decided to start a whole new character and level, and as it stands, it's an awful experience for new players. I literally felt like I hadn't learned a single thing about the class I had picked from 1-60 because of how streamlined that portion of the game is.
[0:52:40] blumberquack: Sure but tbh I think vets are just scared that WoW isn't the titan it used to be, and they're figuring out something to blame that isn't themselves LUL
[0:52:53] Teth33: I think they focused on what people who play the game think a new player should know rather than what an actual new player wants to know.
[0:52:54] BajaBlasta: I found it complicated when i started tbh
[0:52:56] witchhobbit: tneTaliWasRight
[0:52:58] aeson_of_raid_sock: my younger in laws definitely needed these new player things
[0:52:58] Fibnkak: complicated. have the play game of the year BG3
[0:52:58] Saiyori: The chief complaint ive heard from new players is that it gets complicated /at max level/ and they're not ready for it
[0:52:59] grimblymcgoo: Asmon just gets viewers to carry him through shit so he can bitch about how its all lame
[0:52:59] Shirey12: asmon went on a big rant about wow last night on stream for like 2 hours
[0:53:03] keyboardturner: all i can say is i'm glad new players don't need to play shadowlands
[0:53:07] JarJar_Brinkz: @Teth33 This
[0:53:10] rowanoaken: It's difficult to say because my dad helped me level when I was 12 - so I guess I don't have a say
[0:53:25] Saiyori: a lot of new players have told me it's too easy lvling up and they get bored
[0:53:27] ronconi: every MMO is complicated in some level
[0:53:30] aeson_of_raid_sock: without the new player stuff I know younger people would not have stuck
[0:53:43] mattyxoqt: I leveled a ret paladin all the way to 60 without keybinds back in classic kek
[0:53:47] FourJhinCookies: Current WoW isn't too complicated, but it's presented poorly and in a visually cluttered way. Like waaaay too cluttered
[0:53:48] rowanoaken: I mean - isn't it the meme that loads of Asmongold viewers haven't even played the game?
[0:53:48] Durwen: It took me embarrasingly long to figure out i could vendor my stuff
[0:53:50] gsrasslan: I stayed with WoW *because* it was complicated. There was just so much stuff you could do in the game
[0:53:53] Reminii91: hey mobile games nowadays are hard :D, i play wow to relax lol
[0:53:58] thunduz: not picking up WoW because their guild in EverQuest left for it
[0:54:00] JarJar_Brinkz: @aeson_of_raid_sock how though, the new player stuff is new
[0:54:04] elbardo_ts: as a BM hunter main, complexity is a strong word
[0:54:27] Fibnkak: maybe he is having a mid streamer crisis?
[0:54:33] eternitycrystal: they try to make a console game of WoW. Can we not have another console game ffs, keep pc games for pc.
[0:54:36] TankenFunk: @keyboardturner Tbf, I leveled more characters to max level during SL than any other expac, I like the questing there a lot
[0:54:42] Reminii91: his editors are making bank from all the clickbait inflammatory thumnails
[0:54:42] elbardo_ts: also I started playing my pandarendh and i just face roll to dps
[0:54:45] aeson_of_raid_sock: @jarjar_brinkz yeah they started when it came out
[0:54:45] mrmanno14: “the War Within is Dead”
[0:54:50] TankenFunk: @keyboardturner Or maybe there just wasn't much else to do tneEvi
[0:54:52] Synth_San: Asmon having his own war within atm LUL
[0:54:54] witchhobbit: didn't he stop playing in bfa?
[0:54:56] thunduz: I’m sure if it’s him hating on it people are enjoying the  “Ex-WoW player hates on game”
[0:55:05] JarJar_Brinkz: I like how he says he gives his editors free reign over his videos, as if that shoves the blame elsewhere
[0:55:14] Reminii91: you're right on the part where he could just stop them
[0:55:30] netonkent: Wow or retail?
[0:55:32] Reminii91: but he chooses not to so yea...
[0:55:34] SphericFormula: Like, you're their boss dude lol
[0:55:40] Redmanpig: *month
[0:55:41] keyboardturner: his editors are out of control!
[0:55:42] Sanguinerd: clickbait has the opposite effect on me at this point
[0:55:55] bottis96: Last night he kinda went over how when his mom died it changed him and wow reminds him of her being gone
[0:56:11] kaijoe_: Just sucks how those types of titles and opinions just reverberate throughout the community and already start souring opinions.
[0:56:19] HSAyril: If he had a problem with his editors making it sound like he thinks the next expansion is already dead when he doesn't think that he'd tell them to stop misrepresenting him, but he doesn't
[0:56:32] witchhobbit: @bottis96 so that is why he can't play it or let go of it or something?
[0:56:33] eternitycrystal: so he takes it out on wow?
[0:56:41] Metalburnie: @Sanguinerd to be fair, thats always the case for people who know stuff about the topic thats being clickbaited. It's the "unknowing" majority that either gets semi-triggered by it or just butts in to say "i dont care", I think.
[0:56:47] Shirey12: he posted a video talking about wow today "To all my haters"
[0:56:49] SphericFormula: That sounds like unresolved trauma
[0:57:06] kaijoe_: Sounds like therapy would be a nice avenue.
[0:57:19] JarJar_Brinkz: "Italians ruined my life"
[0:57:23] JarJar_Brinkz: That's more accurate for his standard
[0:57:24] eternitycrystal: I mean he earns millions, he can go to a therapist?
[0:57:26] icycoolfresh: Everyone handles grief differently.
[0:57:28] Zambrakk: where did you get your wow poster?
[0:57:30] Fibnkak: stereotype?
[0:57:30] witchhobbit: therapy is very nice and he could easily afford it lol
[0:57:36] atamala: trauma caused by mom's spaghetti. eninem had a deeper motive
[0:57:36] thunduz: I mean I play WoW with my mom so I can see how playing a game when a loved one was around and they aren’t are no longer yeah I can see how it would leave some odd feelings
[0:57:37] Reminii91: it's not the only reason, the dude moved on from WoW now. he says it himself and he's just keeping with the trendy topics
[0:57:42] GoldSmog: Codependent relationships with your parents into your 30s will do that
[0:57:43] witchhobbit: can be very nice*
[0:57:53] keyboardturner: so asmon is basically traumadumping on us? NotLikeThis
[0:58:02] Blighthung: Let's just forget about Ass mongold please. respect him let him be. No doubt he is toxic on something that we are about to experience.
[0:58:03] Triskelian: @kaijoe_ Hell will freeze over before Asmon gets therapy -_-
[0:58:06] SphericFormula: But then how he channels that into hatred on a game which in turn makes him large profit.... idk man
[0:58:17] OGaxelaw: i think asmon dug himself into a deep hole hating wow so much that if he does come back everyone wil just call him a sell out at this point
[0:58:22] Blighthung: sorry
[0:58:24] eternitycrystal: hhaaha
[0:58:47] Sanguinerd: @Sanguinerd Yeah every "WoW is Dead" video annoys us because we're here playing and that's clearly not the case
[0:58:48] mikael_jansson90: @TaliesinAndEvitel wait are u still talking about asmongold? did u not do that yesterday? like drop it and move on to another topic
[0:58:52] JarJar_Brinkz: He has a character named assmongler tbf
[0:59:08] witchhobbit: tali are you going to become a tarot card girlie with the new wow tarot deck coming out?
[0:59:19] Togglegoggle: I feel like this is end-of-expansion blues.
[0:59:19] ronconi: involving bellular in this is kind of a dick move
[0:59:20] icycoolfresh: Is it still okay to talk about bellulars balls?
[0:59:23] mrmanno14: WoW’s been dead since 2024 fam, rip
[0:59:33] mrmanno14: 2004*
[0:59:39] HSAyril: As someone who watches both Tali and Asmon it's interesting how widely varied the opinions and assumptions are from chat
[0:59:43] kinslayerneko: WoW's been dead to me for a while
[0:59:47] icycoolfresh: tneNoSnitch
[0:59:49] TankenFunk: By Bell's Balls!
[0:59:51] eternitycrystal: lets bash wow train happens every pre wow expansion. They are really hungry for internet money
[0:59:59] atamala: WoW is dead! Long live WoW!
[1:00:14] JarJar_Brinkz: What are the hero talent concerns
[1:00:26] JarJar_Brinkz: I haven't looked at any of it tbh
[1:00:26] HSAyril: Half the comments in that video are arguing about the 3 of them saying brown rice isn't healthier than white rice lol
[1:00:36] rowanoaken: I mean - we were talking about his well-coordinated brand yesterday - but surely hating WoW is part of his brand at this point - which sucks - but I don't think he can be content with the game because would that even be Asmon?
[1:00:41] thunduz: Blizz listen to what everyone is telling you. move away from talents and make them skins
[1:00:46] eternitycrystal: booom!
[1:00:50] thunduz: yes, 100%
[1:00:51] Fibnkak: what there a problem with shaman hero talents or we still assume we won’t get them till release
[1:01:00] eternitycrystal: they like the white one
[1:01:01] OGaxelaw: my thing is... when you are having trouble balancing a game already why throw in hero talents that are obviously going to break the game
[1:01:04] Reminii91: how're you disagreeing on everything lol?
[1:01:04] ebrahim_91: Brown Rice>> White Rice
[1:01:07] molecular6167: Rice is still low fibre in general.
[1:01:10] ajman1101: i'm shocked! a react youtuber is misrepresenting a video they reacted to/talked over! what a surprise!! so, anyways.......any SoD playtime?
[1:01:11] JarJar_Brinkz: The ones on one side have Trump shoes... Lets put it that way Kappa
[1:01:12] GoldSmog: You can thank Joe Rogan for that take
[1:01:14] mrmanno14: Asians would like a word
[1:01:16] MrAxeffect: white rice is easier to digest so thats a thing
[1:01:22] blumberquack: I'm still excited for hero talents for my classes lol, none of the shown hero talents are for specs I play so Kapa
[1:01:34] eternitycrystal: joe who?
[1:01:39] thunduz: ugh can that man say anything correct?
[1:01:40] Deralis: no wayyyyy
[1:01:41] MrScotticus: Baffles me that people listen to Joe Rogan
[1:01:41] icycoolfresh: Bro Jogan
[1:01:49] Teth33: Brown rice is lower calorie, lower carb
[1:01:50] Mythridates: at least his fans distinguish themselves
[1:01:51] Thowarr: Slo Rogan
[1:01:52] blumberquack: Bleach really helps clean your system Kappa
[1:01:52] elbardo_ts: you know that simpsons episode where Homer's mome come back and he does a lot of random things children do to catch their mom's atention and she's like "si si ya te vimos muy bonito"? well that's how we should react to these random dumbass videos
[1:01:54] Reminii91: so is it or is it not, chat?
[1:02:00] Synth_San: @MrAxeffect So to that point, I'd rather have brown rice to feel fuller longer LUL
[1:02:10] thunduz: it's healthier just facts lol
[1:02:16] rowanoaken: Yeah let's get all of Asia in the chat
[1:02:19] bladestitch: Don't care, eat what I like.
[1:02:22] molecular6167: Brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice
[1:02:25] Fibnkak: I thought Asian ate wild rice ?
[1:02:27] Togglegoggle: surely you can read the nutritional values of both and determine which is better.
[1:02:36] CeasiusPls: Both are healthier than the junk food that is the norm
[1:02:40] GoldSmog: He said something about nutrients being taken away, idk
[1:02:41] einomar: My concern is the names they attach to them. Dark ranger for example creates a certain expectations that will not be met.
[1:02:49] Reminii91: we're starting to eat it but WHITE rice still the best tasting one lol
[1:02:50] TankenFunk: It's a stupid discussion too, cause yes, brown rice is healthier, but that doesn't mean you can't exclusively enjoy/eat white rice. If you eat healthily "enough," whatever that means for you, it doesn't really matter
[1:02:56] Lenitas: I just prefer brown rice
[1:02:59] ajman1101: if the internet has taught me anything, you have to only eat one thing to live, soylent green!
[1:02:59] atamala: it's not even rice, it's just high fructose corn syrup
[1:02:59] Mewsette_kitty: omg
[1:03:04] thunduz: I would not be surprised
[1:03:04] ronconi: like american "cheese"
[1:03:07] MxViolet: I wouldnt be surprised
[1:03:07] gsrasslan: Their bread is basically cake
[1:03:10] kinslayerneko: moon2FAT
[1:03:11] Mewsette_kitty: OMG
[1:03:14] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel yeah, we add HP Sauce and call it "brown"
[1:03:15] HSAyril: That's racist
[1:03:15] witcherpie: @einomar i disagree, the hero talents actually look amazing for dark ranger
[1:03:17] eternitycrystal: yea american's feed shit to their own people. Can't you see it how weird they look
[1:03:19] MxViolet: but they dont have to, because they convinced everyone to buy white rice
[1:03:19] MrAxeffect: white rice in dirty water is brown rice
[1:03:20] Seaffin: With yellow 5, of course
[1:03:25] Athaerick: As an American, I would NOT be surprised to find that to be true
[1:03:29] Fibnkak: that is Spanish roach and that brown rice is tasty AF
[1:03:29] bladestitch: They probably deep fry the rice.
[1:03:33] Fibnkak: rice
[1:03:35] icycoolfresh: Fight me lol but you're right
[1:03:35] elbardo_ts: yamani rice is nice
[1:03:37] Mewsette_kitty: brown rice is the same as right rice it just still has the husk
[1:03:39] Atomicpanda: it's just white rice with molasses added
[1:03:39] Sikuq: they had parmesan with sawdust in America
[1:03:42] JarJar_Brinkz: Deep fried rice is a thing
[1:03:45] keyboardturner: i always got my rice from asian grocery store so idk if that's the case myself as an american
[1:03:47] bladestitch: Healthy?
[1:03:48] Teth33: As a weird looking American it's not because of what I eat, it's because of the pacts I made with the dark lords.

[1:04:35] einomar: To much sugar in american bread

[1:04:57] chryseis: The one time I had American bread, it tasted like cake

[1:05:40] ajman1101: are the British good at cheese or did enough french hop the pond a few hundred years ago?
[1:05:43] atamala: I think that's changing in America though; sure there is the wonderbread stuff but there is a lot of "artisanal" options nowadays
[1:05:44] Reminii91: wow we're really veered off topic into food now. what happened to War Within is Dead?

[1:05:48] Nulgar: @bucephalos this
[1:05:52] kinslayerneko: an overabundance of shite for food
[1:05:54] grumpy_dan: Because communist countries are poorer they would lean towards brown rice because its cheaper. Therefore brown rice = communist. Checkmate
[1:05:58] Thowarr: Guys... he's been everywhere in the US and can def make that statement
[1:05:58] beohoof: Like our chocolate, the best bread is from San Fransisco

[1:06:10] mrmanno14: British only good with cheese and baking

[1:07:01] SquiggySquonk: What about fish & chips?
[1:07:04] merzicdh: Did you hear about the explosion at the cheese factory? All thats left is da brie.
[1:07:08] literally_human_garbage: checkmate atheists
[1:07:09] eternitycrystal: righhtttt....
[1:07:15] Mewsette_kitty: do people understand that white rice is the same as brown it’s just had the brown husk removed
[1:07:15] Thowarr: Chicken tikka yes, bolognese sauce? ok...
[1:07:16] avatos_94: feels very british museum lol
[1:07:26] Krovig: Ragù alla Bolognese, referred to as Bolognese sauce, is a meat-based sauce originating from the city of Bologna in northern Italy. Bolognese sauce was served as a topping for tagliatelle, a flat, ribbon-like pasta, enjoyed by many in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.
[1:07:31] Shirey12: Wisonsin Cheese >>>>
[1:07:32] elbardo_ts: spanish food is better than italian food
[1:07:34] OGaxelaw: wonder bread feeds the hungry and saves lives so its actually the most healthy bread in the world hands down !
[1:07:37] Atomicpanda: at best any food is phenomenal
[1:07:38] Teth33: You have to like cream/butter to like French food.
[1:07:41] thunduz: so whats your reaction when you order a burger here and they ask if you'd like American for the cheese?
[1:07:43] Shirey12: Wisconsin*
[1:07:44] Foxheart_Games: American "cheese" is a crime too me xD
[1:07:45] Synkronos: Britain is a big dairy country, it makes sense that cheese is a big thing
[1:07:50] Thowarr: @Krovig Tali will always claim other cultures foods as "originating in the UK"
[1:07:53] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: Oh for pity's sake, CHEDDAR! The Scots would rather people stop saying "Chicken Tikka" was invented in Britain though.
[1:08:00] Togglegoggle: colonialism is bad, BUT...
[1:08:02] mrmanno14: the only cheese that belongs on a burger is American
[1:08:05] caradosailanthus: @Foxheart_Games product
[1:08:10] Thowarr: @Togglegoggle Those are always his best takes
[1:08:11] JarJar_Brinkz: @mrmanno14 rdcSalute
[1:08:12] RosieSeren: the owner of the indian chain Mowgli talks about it, that indian chefs purposefully changted their dishes for a british palette to do better business
[1:08:17] OGaxelaw: american cheese is only for cheese burgers though.. which every american knows
[1:08:17] tehl00py: colonized?! /s
[1:08:20] Vidaloo: Spaghetti Bolognese was invented in Italy and popularised in 1487 for the wedding of the Duc of Ferrara and Lucrecia Borgia
[1:08:29] caradosailanthus: Cheese product, apparently it didn't like *
[1:08:31] Thowarr: @Vidaloo This is a facts free channel
[1:08:33] Teth33: That's like how General Tso's chicken is an American creation.
[1:08:35] netonkent: French food is bad Italian food imo
[1:08:48] eternitycrystal: so it's a briti-fied indian food?
[1:08:51] beohoof: American cheese is the only correct cheese for a cheeseburger, since it doesn't split while melting
[1:08:51] molecular6167: Time for the Rowan Atkinson now that we have the recipe sketch.
[1:08:54] elbardo_ts: @Vidaloo that's not true
[1:08:56] literally_human_garbage: general tso's is so good
[1:08:59] Reminii91: we're really deep into the food topic now
[1:09:00] unfailable: Thats the same as USA food, there is so much food here from other cultures. Its hard to say what is "USA" food.
[1:09:11] OGaxelaw: general tso's chicken is orange chicken with spice lol its just an american name lol
[1:09:13] atamala: near bologna, united kingdom
[1:09:17] rowanoaken: Omg the battle of the people who know how to Google
[1:09:32] elbardo_ts: every italian recipe that uses tomato cannot be older than 500 years
[1:09:33] einomar: Google battle! Nice!
[1:09:40] witcherpie: bologna is literally in italy tho
[1:09:45] VimFuego1970: major caveat. UK is great at HARD cheese
[1:09:55] witchhobbit: there was a netflix doc about how chinese american restaurants did that too, makes sense
[1:10:03] RosieSeren: I think a british spag bol is not that authentic xD
[1:10:11] AngryInternetCat: Its called Ragu in Italy. Bolognese is a fake name
[1:10:13] TankenFunk: Take out your notebooks, kids! This will be on the test tomorrow
[1:10:27] caradosailanthus: Tomatoes come from South America
[1:10:32] Sikuq: are you part italian tali?
[1:10:39] bettys_dungeon_adventures: youd have it with tagliatelle traditionally
[1:10:42] eternitycrystal: ra-goo, whats that?
[1:10:42] TankenFunk: "However..."
[1:10:44] Vidaloo: Hold on I'm double checking my sources
[1:10:47] mrmanno14: did you add an extra syllable to pasta?
[1:10:47] netonkent: Meat is normally served after pasta
[1:10:53] JarJar_Brinkz: @OGaxelaw Not true, Orange chicken was made in merica. And General tso isn't orange based
[1:10:54] ramzie0: Amatriciana is typically served with spaghetti or bucatini
[1:10:55] OGaxelaw: italians would never put pineapple on pizza either though... shame on them
[1:10:57] sebnificant: Didn't the mayor of Bolognoa make a statement saying "spagetthi bolognese doesn't exist"
[1:10:58] Thowarr: In Bologna ragù is traditionally paired and served with tagliatelle made with eggs and northern Italy's soft wheat flour. Acceptable alternatives to fresh tagliatelle include other broad flat pasta shapes, such as pappardelle or fettuccine, and tube shapes, such as rigatoni and penne.[21] While the combination of the ragù with fresh tagliatelle remains the most traditional and authentic in the Bolognese cuisine, some – such as Piero Valdiserra – have argued in favour of capitalizing on its alrea
[1:11:07] CandiceGrevangele: gimme dat ppaghetti aglio e olio
[1:11:14] Durwen: copper extruded parpadelle :3
[1:11:16] aeson_of_raid_sock: what about a Boyardee?
[1:11:18] databob1: Spaghetti was meant for oil or oil based sauce
[1:11:30] avatos_94: Great now I’m hungry for pasta
[1:11:32] Gacchers: Hey Tali I watched your weekly reset/trial of steve danuser and depsite being one of the danuser dislikers I thought it was fair :)
[1:11:39] nervous_robot_: Chat recommend me a game I can play without my full attention at work.
[1:11:40] bladestitch: What is the weirdest food you have in UK?
[1:11:43] bucephalos: spaghetti ice >----Bolognese
[1:11:54] elbardo_ts: spanish food is better than italian food
[1:11:58] vlaovich88: Beans for breakfast
[1:11:59] Sorin__: Jellied eels
[1:12:00] bladestitch: ew
[1:12:01] ebrahim_91: I am going to be in London in July!
[1:12:03] spettetgaming: haggis in scotland
[1:12:09] avatos_94: english breakfast makes me shiver
[1:12:13] thunduz: This is like when Emily from Fremily revealed to me that Fettichini Alfredo is not an actual Italian dish. The rage I felt inside
[1:12:14] RosieSeren: I'd say jellied eals, from liverpool I think? never tried but ew
[1:12:20] TankenFunk: @ebrahim_91 I will be there in April, beat that! tneEvi
[1:12:24] Bambiprsi: youre right about it, that Italians actually think about the food theyre cooking, and wouldve nevere mix pasta with chunky sauce, thats only what English caveman would do
[1:12:28] Togglegoggle: i'm sorry, what?
[1:12:28] eternitycrystal: jellied what?
[1:12:30] VimFuego1970: and at least we can all agree Germany does the best bread
[1:12:34] ophypanda: liver and onions
[1:12:37] molecular6167: The eels died out.
[1:12:39] snacketysnack: Hi - just driving by here. If we are talking UK food, the best thing I ever had in my time in the UK was a cheddar and onion Stottie in Newcastle. Crave it everyday now.
[1:12:39] HSAyril: Jellied eels??
[1:12:43] ebrahim_91: @TankenFunk ahahaha
[1:12:44] Gacchers: Wait Jellied Eels?
[1:12:48] ophypanda: Scrapple
[1:12:50] Vidaloo: Anyways yeah I can't find good sources to back what I said so probably just a story
[1:12:50] JarJar_Brinkz: Ohhhhhh surely thats just gummy worms? It's just lost in liverpool translation
[1:12:54] Durwen: Okay, I love eel sushi, but in jelly?
[1:13:04] thunduz: so what is a Spag bowl that you make?
[1:13:07] Thowarr: There's always exceptions to the rules for Italian food
[1:13:18] aeson_of_raid_sock: I had nothing good in England lol
[1:13:19] elbardo_ts: Fusilli goes well with bolognese
[1:13:21] bladestitch: Sounds little like Lutfisk in sweden.
[1:13:21] thunduz: oooooo
[1:13:33] RosieSeren: james acaster does a good spag bol routine
[1:13:38] ophypanda: Scrapple is typically made of hog offal, such as the head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth.
[1:13:40] OGaxelaw: i think its hard to say american food is bad. i like to more say american food is harder to find. its the melting pot of the world. a simple family restruant on the corner of any street can be the most amazing heritage food you ever had
[1:13:42] Atomicpanda: now i know what a spag ball is.
[1:14:05] witchhobbit: i have convinced myself that kerrygold is the best butter i can buy in the US but idk if that is actually true or not tneEvi
[1:14:10] VimFuego1970: @bladestitch is a lot like Lutfisk
[1:14:19] ramzie0: Amatriciana > Ragu change my mind
[1:14:23] elbardo_ts: hey tali, talking about pasta, have you ever tried sorrentinos?
[1:14:30] krisz49: whats the name of the cookbook again please? :D
[1:14:41] OGaxelaw: but san francisco sour dough is world famous for some reason?
[1:14:43] eternitycrystal: so americans are eating shit cheese?
[1:14:43] thunduz: nice!
[1:14:45] krisz49: Artuzi?
[1:14:45] nervous_robot_: American bagels be slappin though
[1:14:47] krisz49: thx!
[1:14:48] chryseis: Canadian cheese is delightful
[1:14:48] CandiceGrevangele: you really see how bad "regular" supermarket cheese is when you start shopping farmers markets and picking up locally made cheeses
[1:14:51] Durwen: italians also don't put cream in carbonara, what the hell do they know :p
[1:14:52] caradosailanthus: Imported cheese is the way to go in the US
[1:14:53] Harper_n7: I used to work at a cheese factory in the US, can confirm its shit
[1:14:53] RosieSeren: ironically the best 'american' style cheeseburger I've had was in Greece, want to go back just for that
[1:15:03] MxViolet: we can make pizza and bagels, thats about it
[1:15:06] eternitycrystal: LUL
[1:15:06] BajaBlasta: cream cheese
[1:15:15] AlanC2024: my parents hated me when i ate spag bol when i was young since i made such a mess on my face
[1:15:23] keyboardturner: is worth noting that there's a difference between american cheese and the "kraft singles" thing and legally cannot be called cheese
[1:15:23] Harai_Ulfsark: depending on food regulations being lax, it can be quite literally shit cheese
[1:15:26] witchhobbit: oh kraft is disgusting
[1:15:28] OGaxelaw: yeah thats cheeseburger cheese !
[1:15:29] AlanC2024: true
[1:15:32] thunduz: You could say that about any food here lol say "shit" and pick a food and you got it lol
[1:15:33] beohoof: Americans don't take the time to do cheese rpoperly. We buy shreded and pre-sliced crap. Go to any decent cheese case and its really good
[1:15:33] MxViolet: its chemically closer to plastic than cheese
[1:15:35] ophypanda: NOOOOO no plastic cheese!!!
[1:15:35] atamala: so if an american dairy makes a european style cheese, is that american or european? in your statement
[1:15:41] den_of_bricks: American cheese is disgusting
[1:15:42] aeson_of_raid_sock: you can’t just judge on the worst example
[1:15:46] Atomicpanda: "cheese product"
[1:15:50] elbardo_ts: i'm very tempted to start the sandwich fiasco again
[1:15:52] bottis96: what about a sandwich

[1:15:58] eternitycrystal: starbucks is suggar water

[1:16:04] atamala: @elbardo_ts lovely topic for a wednesday 100%
[1:16:05] RosieSeren: Mcdonalds does better coffee weirdly
[1:16:06] ophypanda: You can actually get blocks of American White Cheese with no dyes. You literally slice it yourself
[1:16:07] TankenFunk: @elbardo_ts Please don't tneTaliCry
[1:16:07] krisz49: agreed
[1:16:07] markaud23: exactly right
[1:16:08] witchhobbit: only my grandmother uses kraft cheese, the rest of us don't LUL
[1:16:09] MeggoArt: no one sits down and eats a packaged american cheese slice by itself, it goes on other stuff
[1:16:11] JarJar_Brinkz: What are you looking for in your cheese
[1:16:22] OGaxelaw: american cheese isnt even good mac n cheese stuff velvita  ect
[1:16:26] lykynn: gordon ramsay knows cheese lol
[1:16:29] Durwen: again, Americans turning stuff into desserts
[1:16:29] MxViolet: taste and texture
[1:16:30] mendax55: u must rly hate dunkin haha
[1:16:34] eternitycrystal: @JarJar_Brinkz it should stink
[1:16:39] elbardo_ts: hey tali, do you like american cheese in chicken sandwiches?
[1:16:42] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: PROCESSED CHEESE FOOD = American Cheese
[1:16:42] Atomicpanda: i never met a cheese i didn't like.
[1:16:44] databob1: @TaliesinAndEvitel maybe the processed cheese is bad but there are some cheese makers that do a proper job in the us
[1:16:45] atamala: @TaliesinAndEvitel do you mean "american" as the type of cheese or are you saying ANY cheese made in america is  bad?  I'm confused
[1:16:49] thunduz: @MeggoArt I legit used to do that as a kid and I don't think I could do such a thing these days lol
[1:16:51] JarJar_Brinkz: @eternitycrystal monkaS
[1:16:52] TankenFunk: elbardo noooooo!!! tneTaliCry

[1:16:55] Trebled_Mind: I live in Portland, Oregon so skipping Starbucks is the easiest decision. We have great coffee 🤌🏻
[1:17:01] JarJar_Brinkz: I do love a really strong sharp cheddar
[1:17:11] Tahalamaius: if you call american cheese "cheese" then you also have to say canned spray cheese is "cheese"
[1:17:16] RosieSeren: cheddar cheese and acacia honey is the best
[1:17:24] saarkhastick: We make some good cheddar here but "American Cheese" shouldn't really count as cheeses.
[1:17:26] thunduz: @elbardo_ts tneTali I see what you're doing
[1:17:31] bladestitch: The different way countries serve their cheese has cause some amusement for me.
[1:17:41] MeggoArt: have we talked the wow tarot yet
[1:17:41] lykynn: do you like geno's cheesesteak
[1:17:41] atamala: there are tons of american cheese that isn't "american" cheese that is amazing and I think that's missing in this discussion
[1:17:42] eternitycrystal: french blue cheese are those ones that mate your tongue go numb?
[1:17:45] elbardo_ts: @thunduz :P
[1:17:51] Reminii91: you play games like Elden Ring Tali? there's a new DLC

[1:18:10] elbardo_ts: hey tali, do you like american cheese in chicken sandwiches?
[1:18:11] VimFuego1970: I used to live in Cropwell Bishop and they gave you a free cheese at Christmas if you lived near the dairy
[1:18:12] witchhobbit: whole foods has some good cheese, if you can deal with going there and spending $20 on one thing
[1:18:15] caradosailanthus: Craft "American Cheese" actually says "cheese product" on the label, it can't be labeled as "cheese"
[1:18:19] bladestitch: My friend brought a swedis cheese slicer to new zealand and people were amazed. :P
[1:18:27] Harai_Ulfsark: whats up with tarot lately btw

[1:18:42] ebrahim_91: That wow tarot is right up my alley
[1:18:43] TankenFunk: End of discussion.
[1:18:43] elbardo_ts: ok i'll stop

[1:22:19] keyboardturner: if it's lipton, they manage to fuck it up. everything in my heritage hates lipton with a passion, i don't know how they manage to make the worst tea in the world that practically insults real tea by its very existence

[1:39:42] caradosailanthus: I've got my portals in the the Timeways
[1:39:47] Stamps42: So many quests on your minimap.  Please grab them, my ocd.
[1:39:59] Sebleh: btw random off topic but I loved your video on Danuser because you can say what you want about the guy but he’s got SO much misdirected hate. he’s not my favorite, but I feel for the guy.
[1:40:07] thunduz: I only enjoyed grouping up with you but playing solo SOD? not for me lol
[1:40:20] thunduz: but more people geeking about wow is great
[1:40:27] AngryInternetCat: They made changes based in the success of classic
[1:40:35] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to Sebleh! 
[1:40:56] Sebleh: oh poggies, thank you @thunduz !
[1:41:06] JarJar_Brinkz: I'm really not... I enjoyed the quests and storylines in DF, and if he spearheaded that. I'm worried
[1:41:15] neverbornlucky: Taliesin to the wow community stve is like that crazy u7ncle you never wanted to show up at thanksgiving
[1:41:27] ebrahim_91: I wonder how they will deal with Sylvanas / Calia now
[1:41:35] thunduz: @Sebleh you are welcome
[1:41:35] netonkent: Dunsers stories had so much potential
[1:41:37] Sebleh: I think Danuser was more bandaid fixes but they’re letting Terran and Metzen do more large scale world building
[1:42:17] TankenFunk: @neverbornlucky Just that the community painted him like that, very unfairly if you ask me
[1:42:29] JarJar_Brinkz: But not everything Metzen touched turned to gold
[1:42:39] Lenitas: I love that bit. Call me an anarchist but I love it when authority and power is pulled into question in my narratives
[1:42:42] Saiyori: PITIFUL MORTALS
[1:42:46] mosart: but the jailer was so hot NotLikeThis
[1:43:20] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like people complaining that the lore is so bad now haven't been paying attention, like people have always complained about the wow lore and story.
[1:43:23] neverbornlucky: Taliesin, but what does Nobbel say about steve
[1:44:06] XxJagershotxX: wait wait wait, what was in the exploring Kalimdor book?
[1:44:14] eternitycrystal: I love dragon flight, first expansion I never took a break
[1:44:32] RosieSeren: difference between professional and personal
[1:45:08] TankenFunk: Ah, the American dream
[1:45:09] TankenFunk: tneEvi
[1:45:11] sapphire_rosa_: Hiya!
[1:45:12] Saiyori: To  me, if your worst crime as a writer is being cringe (jailer), then you're not a villain. He was kind of a 50/50 coin for me, a lot of really good stuff and a lot of really meh stuff.
[1:45:37] Sebleh: @xxjagershotxx iirc it was the depiction of trolls as ignorant and learning basic things like reading and writing, being problematic because of what irl culture they’re based on.
[1:45:53] eternitycrystal: WoW won't die DF is so good
[1:46:11] Saiyori: DF is my fave expac gameplay wise, MoP is still my fave expac narrative-wise
[1:46:12] hexen109: I blame him for Shadowlands
[1:46:13] Harper_n7: Was Steve Danuser the one that Pyro got really mad at in his rage quit video? Was Steve the one who decided to use all different kinds of media?
[1:46:13] Stamps42: We'll never see 12 mil subs again lets be real
[1:46:14] keyboardturner: the folk and fairytales stories were some of the best things i liked i think
[1:46:28] gygyorggy: Wow will never be saved
[1:46:51] AssumptionPrime: I wasn't around in SL, what was great about 9.1.5?
[1:46:52] JarJar_Brinkz: Folk and Fairytales was great
[1:47:00] Sicknessqt: @Stamps42  because of bigger competition today.
[1:47:07] TankenFunk: I heard Steve was responsible for the whole Wrathgate fiasco Kappa
[1:47:07] aeson_of_raid_sock: I was hoping we got some fairytale stuff in DF
[1:47:15] aeson_of_raid_sock: like Elune etc.
[1:47:22] Dazzaw17: @AssumptionPrime nothing
[1:47:25] Stamps42: @Sicknessqt yeap that's 1 reason
[1:47:29] witchhobbit: folk and fairytales was the first wow book i bought
[1:47:38] XxJagershotxX: fantasy has such racist undertones
[1:47:43] gygyorggy: People will say the game got better in df but the story sucked
[1:47:45] Harper_n7: Then I like Steve cuz that video is fuckin hilarious
[1:47:51] JarJar_Brinkz: People just didn't give a shit about WoW story until it got "bad"
[1:47:57] keyboardturner: idk if that's necessarily the fault of the author is it
[1:48:02] netonkent: Unfortunely they will say it's metEn
[1:48:04] JarJar_Brinkz: Like people who don't know a lick about the story say the story is bad LUL its weird
[1:48:07] chryseis: It's always been a thing. Theramore literally got bombed 'off screen'
[1:48:07] thunduz: yeah odd take
[1:48:08] vlaovich88: Novels predate WoW.
[1:48:16] mosart: @JarJar_Brinkz nah, not true. People loved the story in wrath
[1:48:16] neverbornlucky: Taliesin wow lore is the only thing about the game I never quit even when stopped playing wow loved the books
[1:48:28] hexen109: problem is that WoW's storytelling is disconnected, and connecting it requires a lot of legwork on the player, so it's hard to tell if it's the writer's fault
[1:48:28] Harper_n7: I love the blue dragonflight story
[1:48:44] JarJar_Brinkz: @mosart Yeah, definitely not LUL people loved Arthas... The rest of it people just rushed through to get done
[1:48:54] Mythridates: i like big butts and i cannot lie
[1:48:56] mosart: @JarJar_Brinkz they still cared.
[1:48:59] Harper_n7: Actually, let's be real... you're only saying you like Dragonflight cuz you're a Blizzard shill and you got tuskarr
[1:48:59] keyboardturner: alexstrazsa (or rather her absence and not having cool moments) probably is the main thing I think that hurts the story of dragonflight
[1:49:02] TankenFunk: People say the story suck and then can only mention a very few, specific dialogue lines to justify the entire story being bad. It is very disheartening to see tbh
[1:49:04] flaccid_rage: I guess nobody here saw your danuser video?
[1:49:13] bladestitch: I generally try not to listen too much on others opinion of how they think the story SHOULD be. I want to enjoy the story as is.
[1:49:18] eternitycrystal: DF story is also good I think people like asmon or bellular are bashing the game so people think the story is automatically bad
[1:49:22] rowanoaken: That blue dragonflight questline... tneMovEviHeartEyes
[1:49:26] netonkent: 9.0 was done if
[1:49:29] keyboardturner: I think the vast majority of dragonflgiht's story is very good though
[1:49:33] hexen109: problem with it is, if I start playing WoW right now, which story will I see?
[1:49:41] flaccid_rage: You guys are all nerds and you need to move on
[1:49:41] hexen109: it'll have many parts missing
[1:49:57] netonkent: 9.0 lore  was some of the best in any game I've played
[1:50:03] TankenFunk: Cue the Path of the Creator section of the stream! tneEvi
[1:50:15] JarJar_Brinkz: @mosart You can believe that if you like. But there's a reason people are upset about books now, and weren't then.. When there were plenty books
[1:50:18] mosart: DF story doesn't feel bad but it does feel quite boring since there's not that many explosive moments imo, no planet stabbing :(
[1:50:22] Nulgar: It doesn't even work in FFXIV
[1:50:31] XxJagershotxX: @flaccid_rage 😂
[1:50:47] mosart: @JarJar_Brinkz Just because you don't engage with every piece of lore doesn't invalidate your opinion imo
[1:51:02] JarJar_Brinkz: @mosart I didn't say that. I said they didn't care about it LUL
[1:51:22] Nulgar: @hexen109 do you NEED to see all the story first before arriving at current content?
[1:51:33] netonkent: I wish you could play any expansion even at max level
[1:51:57] butlerlog: the reason they ARE upset is their streamers have told them its bad
[1:52:21] oiye_: Oh shit ur almost 3k didn't know u r a big gamer
[1:52:40] Redmanpig: Pyro was more talking about the number of books that came out in  one or two expansions
[1:52:52] Harper_n7: Some people just need something to be angry at and to take their daily frustration out on
[1:52:56] Nulgar: Eh, the negative ones definitely shape opinion of gullible people
[1:52:56] butlerlog: yeah ok fair
[1:53:03] HSAyril: The stuff in novels before expansions aren't addressed at all in the game and the game doesn't catch people up to the events between the two expansions
[1:53:08] butlerlog: they definitely amplify it though
[1:53:17] gygyorggy: Ashes of creation, RIOT mmo, Pax Dei!! Wow is doomed anyway
[1:53:26] Sch1ey: People repeat the streamer but they still have those feelings
[1:53:40] RehRehh: NEED MORE BOOBA IN WOW!
[1:53:41] OatsMate: I just hope the novel is good.
[1:53:45] Nulgar: @gygyorggy Riot MMO is DoA, have heard nothing about ot
[1:53:58] casualviewerxqt: yea i think ppl should not bring him up
[1:54:02] gabekan: @gygyorggy I hear that for 10 years at least
[1:54:03] einomar: @gygyorggy  never heard that before... lol
[1:54:04] eternitycrystal: wtf
[1:54:06] thunduz: yeah not a fan of that dude
[1:54:09] Triskelian: @gygyorggy Do you just come in here to shit on WoW
[1:54:13] RehRehh: who?
[1:54:15] eternitycrystal: wow that's crazy
[1:54:30] RehRehh: who killed yo wife a bich what the flip
[1:54:35] eternitycrystal: no you aren't mean
[1:54:38] RehRehh: called**
[1:54:41] Nulgar: @gygyorggy we had "WoW Killers" back then, too, none of them prevailed
[1:54:42] malice101: not mean, very valid
[1:54:47] malakalay: that guys a damn maniac
[1:54:48] eternitycrystal: It made me even like you more :D
[1:54:50] ebrahim_91: no Tali it's warranted tbh
[1:54:51] TankenFunk: @Nulgar Well I have heard it will be the MMO to end all MMOs, so... get rekt tneEvi
[1:55:06] Dazzaw17: wasnt some main story point and reason sylvanas and the jailer  worked together explained in books and not the game? thats what i have a problem with that
[1:55:16] thunduz: lol almost had an intrusive writing moment there. had to delete what i was put there
[1:55:29] krisz49: who sorry? I missed it
[1:55:29] GameingAspect: wait you should ban ppl D:
[1:55:31] eternitycrystal: what
[1:55:32] ver_flashbang: Ban me daddy
[1:55:34] mosart: but muh free speech BabyRage
[1:55:35] keyboardturner: i'm in danger D:
[1:55:36] Nulgar: @dazzaw17 it's also heavily hinted in ingame cinematics
[1:55:43] Redmanpig: I only bring it up to say the difference between the media released outside the game now versus then.
[1:55:55] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I'm misunderstood I'm not bad I swear
[1:55:56] JarJar_Brinkz: @HSAyril Cycle of Hatred tells the story of Theramore, Thrall and Jaina etc.
[1:56:01] aeson_of_raid_sock: ban me. make it hurt lol
[1:56:08] Nulgar: @dazzaw17 tldr Zovaal gaslit her with half-truths and outright lies
[1:56:12] keyboardturner: ffxiv drama Kappa
[1:56:14] Raghoulash_: Who is this? I had to step away
[1:56:15] krisz49: u hate who ?
[1:56:15] einomar: tneSuperM1 tneSuperM2
[1:56:19] RehRehh: wait so your saying asmongold is bald??????!!!!!!
[1:56:24] ver_flashbang: drama squeezing in ff14 is a tradition when the content lull is in full swing.
[1:56:27] RehRehh: clipped
[1:56:27] einomar: tneSuperM3 tneSuperM3 tneSuperM4
[1:56:28] TankenFunk: @Dazzaw17 The book expanded and delved deeper into the topic, in a way only books can imo, but it was also explained in game
[1:56:37] einomar: Damn
[1:56:45] einomar: tneSuperM1 tneSuperM2
[1:56:47] Dazzaw17: @Nulgar i know that now, wasnt as informed when i was playing shadowlands though
[1:56:50] einomar: tneSuperM3 tneSuperM4
[1:56:56] XxJagershotxX: I mean, I wouldn’t defend someone who insulted my fiancé, better man than me Tali
[1:56:57] Raghoulash_: Oh Asmon..
[1:57:02] OatsMate: The short stories during Cata and MoP that released for free were good.
[1:57:07] RehRehh: I want to see buffed up playable humans with no beer belly
[1:57:27] JarJar_Brinkz: The Legion ones?
[1:57:32] keyboardturner: thousand years of war
[1:57:33] JarJar_Brinkz: Those were so neat
[1:57:36] Nulgar: @dazzaw17 but it was in the cinematics - people just saw them without context when they were datamined, then skipped them when they actually played ingame
[1:57:39] OatsMate: Oh yea, those were great. "A Thousand Year War."
[1:57:43] random_redshirt: The radio plays were amazing!
[1:57:56] OatsMate: I just wish the outside media had more impact on the story.
[1:58:03] GameingAspect: wats a radio plays
[1:58:03] hexen109: Gul'dan had a Fel Boat spell, we need that as Warlocks
[1:58:06] chryseis: Omg I didn't know those existed
[1:58:08] bleep_: Do you have high hopes for wow going forward or not?
[1:58:08] JarJar_Brinkz: @OatsMate OH god thats a hot take
[1:58:10] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[1:58:15] TankenFunk: Hot take
[1:58:16] TankenFunk: I agree
[1:58:18] Togglegoggle: I wish the outside media had LESS impact on the story
[1:58:28] flaccid_rage: Tali, What are your thoughts on the world tree being the "life" version of old gods?
[1:58:38] einomar: tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill tneTaliShill
[1:58:41] eternitycrystal: some people simply hate WoW for no freaking reason.
[1:58:43] HSAyril: Of course you do, you shill
[1:58:43] Nulgar: @oatsmate wasn't there an MMO that was supposed to follow a TV series? I'm not sure it even launched properly
[1:58:48] JarJar_Brinkz: Are you sure the world soul saga sounds fantastic? HIGHLY credible sources are saying "The War Within is dead" already
[1:58:50] RehRehh: Maybe this is the final 3 expansions
[1:58:55] bladestitch: They have a better start point then before.
[1:58:56] random_redshirt: No!  That was the problem!  Try to understand WoD without reading a synopsis for "War Crimes", it's impossible!
[1:58:56] aeson_of_raid_sock: I think the check from blizzard just hit your account
[1:58:57] OatsMate: No, or at least I wasn't. If you're gonna spend money on having someone write a book, then expect people to pay money for a book, they should have some impact on the MMO.
[1:59:32] Nulgar: @rehrehh lol nah, MS bought the Blizz part of ABK for WoW
[1:59:44] neverbornlucky: Taliesin isn't a shrill he's just british chat
[1:59:55] RehRehh: @Nulgar plot twist they make wow 2 bahahhaha
[2:00:00] rowanoaken: I hate the argument about the "Disnification of WoW" rhetoric. No one can tell me WoW is sunny and happy when the gnolls in the Azure Span drop Tuskarr jerky :'(
[2:00:03] Dazzaw17: god no, I cant read books because i have problems with my eyes. dont force me to read a book NotLikeThis
[2:00:05] Sch1ey: Bfas biggest problem was it should have been 2 expansions worth of lore... kind of like war within
[2:00:13] Wanderona: Venthyr to Horde  , Night Fae to   Aliance , Tuskar to both , What you think ,
[2:00:14] eternitycrystal: I am new to your channel, do people call you shill wtf
[2:00:16] OatsMate: Novels give good character motivation, relevant details, and side-stories, they're great.
[2:00:20] Thoreya: as someone who doesnt really care about wow lore..bfa was the only time i liked the lore
[2:00:25] Thoreya: lol or at least interested in it
[2:00:30] Nulgar: @rehrehh even WoW 2 can't kill WoW tneEvi
[2:00:33] neverbornlucky: Taliesin we know its just how the British people come across we forgive you
[2:00:36] RehRehh: He might be a shill BUT HE IS OUR SHILL
[2:00:36] TankenFunk: tneTaliShill There's even an emote tneEvi
[2:00:39] Triskelian: @dazzaw17 There's always audiobooks :)
[2:00:48] mattster42: Just tuned in to this stream for the first time, immediate follow after hearing a very reasonable take
[2:00:58] AlanC2024: lord of the rings too
[2:01:00] VeronicaRotal: Nazjatar burned through in a patch tho PepePls
[2:01:08] Dazzaw17: @Triskelian true i guess :)
[2:01:20] bladestitch: I can't help think that many that have an opinion on how the story should be are under some delusion that their ideas will be more accepted by the fandom then the devs story.
[2:01:20] thunduz: the 1st and last
[2:01:24] Nulgar: I actually transitioned from playing MTG to just reading books in that universe
[2:01:39] Wanderona: Star Wars today what  you say
[2:01:40] einomar: I really liked bfa, then again I really liked wod as well so my taste might not be ideal xD
[2:01:40] inspector_zed: and the christmas special
[2:01:41] RehRehh: starter edition back in 2015 wow was my childhood bahahahaha
[2:01:45] twootten: and christmas special from star wars!
[2:01:46] thunduz: random video game here and there
[2:01:47] CeasiusPls: As long as they don't pull a wotlk to cataclysm again, that was confusing at the time
[2:01:50] Triskelian: @eternitycrystal It started as a criticism, but now calling Tali a shill is more of an in joke :D
[2:01:56] neverbornlucky: Taliesin do not forget star wars christmas special
[2:02:00] OatsMate: 100% Agree
[2:02:03] JarJar_Brinkz: @einomar The rare person who just enjoys the game when they're having fun
[2:02:04] Nulgar: @inspector_zed ssshhh, don't mention the Christmas Special....
[2:02:11] twootten: haha, selective memory for sure
[2:02:12] thunduz: never forget the Christmas special
[2:02:28] random_redshirt: Additional story media outside the game is great for expanding on lore character motivations that the player character would likely never see.  The Arthas novel gives additional insight into the character without being required reading to understand the game story.
[2:02:31] flaccid_rage: Tali, What are your thoughts on the world tree being the "life" version of old gods?
[2:02:36] bladestitch: There are som stories in outside media that I would love to experience ingame. Not as an expansion but small events.
[2:02:38] keyboardturner: but i thought it was trendy to hate hero talents atm
[2:02:52] JarJar_Brinkz: I just want pirates and quel'thalas. thats all i want in my Warcraft
[2:02:56] netonkent: The warbringers and afterlife where amazing 10/10 but the dragonflight ones where every meh, I don't know if treron had anything with the story
[2:03:05] RehRehh: we need an anduin x thrall story line cyrShook cyrShook cyrShook
[2:03:07] einomar: @jarjar_brinkz  😀
[2:03:17] Nulgar: Tali I'm pretty sure you said that the other way around before frogmu1Hehe
[2:03:19] twootten: is it? seems like most takes are the same: some talents are great, some need work
[2:03:26] JarJar_Brinkz: I actually don't know what the hero talent issues are, what's wrong?
[2:03:40] elbardo_ts: how is going to be the same problem?
[2:03:49] JarJar_Brinkz: Ahhhhh rip PoroSad I just like cool and fun customization
[2:03:54] Wanderona: Have you ever tried to work as an stand up comedian , I think you would be awsome. You have good humor in you.
[2:04:04] Nulgar: @jarjar_brinkz people expected cosmetic "Class Skins", despite them being explained less than an hour later
[2:04:09] twootten: yeah, one will always be better
[2:04:15] OatsMate: I was looking up some of the writers they've hired for the books, the Gazlowe story is written by a horror/scifi writer. And for Alleria, she's...a writer of erotic fiction. And two star wars tie ins...
[2:04:17] Dazzaw17: the hunter one ive seen so far looks pretty dull and dark rangers just visually not being elves will be odd
[2:04:18] Rabiahtaro132: I personally like the idea of it as a casual player. But I knew the problems as soon as they were announced.
[2:04:21] elbardo_ts: everything that is presented as a choise in wow isn't a choise
[2:04:27] bleep_: Think they will keep the level cap boost up a few then reset a few x-pac's later going forward so by the last titan are we back to 60?
[2:04:28] JarJar_Brinkz: Is that a design problem or just players
[2:04:29] elbardo_ts: talents aren't a choise
[2:04:32] bladestitch: Do you think the game would have been more intereresting if the things that have been deemed bad hadn't been implemented?
[2:04:35] JarJar_Brinkz: @Nulgar LUL
[2:04:37] Thoreya: its a lil different than covneants tho, covenants u were locked in for a while
[2:04:46] Thowarr: It's the "illusion of choice"; when they broke down the numbers on covenants, the majority of the playerbase chose the more powerful/optimal option
[2:04:47] Vendrek: I am a Mountain Thane however, I cannot play it because Arms cannot access it...
[2:04:51] VeronicaRotal: plus "Tauren Mountain King" is just a bit.... meh. *I* wanted Gladiator Spec and i got "Dwarf-Tauren".
[2:04:52] Harper_n7: Yeah, more people just need to learn to play what they enjoy and worry less about the 4% more dmg they can have
[2:04:59] Lenitas: Aesthetics have some solid choice options
[2:05:00] Dazzaw17: ive run off meta talents all expansion lol and ive done fine
[2:05:01] XxJagershotxX: Honestly, all I want is to play my paladin and have different ability skins because I don’t want to just roleplay as a follower of the light
[2:05:02] JarJar_Brinkz: @Thowarr So what is the solution? Just have one option for everything?
[2:05:03] netonkent: If they just did class skins it would have been better and so much less work but we will see
[2:05:06] twootten: i think they've done reasonably well with talents this expansion, and if they take that same vibe forward with hero talents, i think it'll be alright. some will be very clearcut, but there'll be some choice in there
[2:05:08] TankenFunk: I mained Feral for all my WoW career, I'm going whatever Hero Talent looks the most appealing aesthetically tneEvi
[2:05:22] Nulgar: @bleep_ i mean, we would reach 100 again in The Last Titan, so 14.0 could bring another level squish, yes
[2:05:27] JarJar_Brinkz: I will never understand this argument though. What is the solution?
[2:05:31] Thowarr: @JarJar_Brinkz No; have everything cosmetic and the rest of the "power upgrades" via talents/gear
[2:05:34] Togglegoggle: my biggest problem with hero talents is how uninspired some of the subclasses are. things like frostfire mage is completely devoid of inspiration
[2:05:40] Harper_n7: what is this site?
[2:05:57] GameingAspect: yup
[2:06:07] JarJar_Brinkz: @Thowarr But talents are the same thing, there will always be meta.
[2:06:19] Thowarr: @JarJar_Brinkz Have just 1 option; they can't tune to save their lives, so stop trying
[2:06:22] elbardo_ts: but that may be not because the player prefers that but because its raid comp requires that
[2:06:32] TownieTV: the highest dps builds usually drop things like cc, interrupts, and dispels. I always run those talents, marginal dps loss be damned.
[2:06:40] JarJar_Brinkz: @Thowarr That sounds terrible
[2:06:42] Thoreya: @Togglegoggle as a mage main, i kinda like having frostfire back
[2:06:47] AngryInternetCat: That means theres choice
[2:07:02] JarJar_Brinkz: I'm just happy to have cool class fantasy stuff, I couldn't care less about the meta LUL and most other people shouldn't either
[2:07:20] Harai_Ulfsark: bears have a lot of choice when picking talents, its amazing tbh
[2:07:52] Togglegoggle: @Thoreya i dont mind the spell type or whatever, but i do think that "mountain thane" or "berserker" has a much stronger fantasy than "frostfire mage" if that makes sense
[2:07:55] Thowarr: @JarJar_Brinkz Then this discussion doesn't involve you; go play your Kyrian Balance druid and have fun
[2:08:14] TankenFunk: Identity? In MY apolitical World of WARcraft? tneEvi
[2:08:16] MashoneAK: A lot of people think that they can just pick the top spec and they will heal as good as the best healers but it actually take skill to play ant the highest levels.
[2:08:30] Sockfire: that sounds fine
[2:08:34] JarJar_Brinkz: @Thowarr I will, and the other 90% of casuals will do the same.
[2:08:38] onathehunter: onathehunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[2:08:39] literally_human_garbage: tbh I think class skins as cosmetic only options would have been preferable to hero talents. that being said - i am excited to see how they turn out
[2:08:42] TownieTV: at least we're not going to have it gated behind a quest line, levels, and charges.
[2:08:52] Thowarr: @JarJar_Brinkz No, they won't; again, the data bore that out
[2:08:57] Rabiahtaro132: In a perfect scenerio you'd be able to pick the one that you vibed with.
[2:09:02] keyboardturner: My frank opinion on it is that people want hero talents to be what they aren't/can't be - they either want it to be the spec rework that overhauls their spec in a radical way because they don't like its current gameplay, or they want it to be class skins when it's basically a lite version tied to player power
[2:09:20] VeronicaRotal: @MashoneAK true but imo it's better to at least have a solid spec to base your play on. I know when *I* try to go with my own gut feeling i get dogshit performance.
[2:09:24] dright424: I think at worst hero talents will just be a bit boring
[2:09:35] saarkhastick: How would class skins work? Like as a Pack Leader BM Hunter, what would that look like?
[2:09:37] VeronicaRotal: Gladiator Stance or riot
[2:09:48] VeronicaRotal: i want a third option to opt out of Hero Talents
[2:09:58] MashoneAK: @VeronicaRotal I agree
[2:10:03] Thowarr: @dright424 Idk, I saw the frostfire mage ones and they sound really cool. They have the potential to bring some really fun gameplay
[2:10:08] doon03: when you say class skins what do you mean?
[2:10:10] Nulgar: Goddammit that is so accurate frogmu1Hehe
[2:10:13] keyboardturner: Kappa
[2:10:23] Harper_n7: From my dev experience, sometimes people just want the option of choice even if they never actually use it..sometimes people just need the allusion of choice
[2:10:24] Sorin__: It's a smidge above green fire
[2:10:29] Thowarr: @saarkhastick See? There's your cosmetic which can fit a fantasy
[2:10:29] elbardo_ts: class skins are league of legends skins
[2:10:29] Vendrek: Personally I think 40% of the talents are OP, 40% are trash, 20% are balanced.
[2:10:34] TankenFunk: Another problem is that even if they were perfectly balanced at optimal play, one of them would be recommended in the guides just for being easier to play
[2:10:39] Hippwn: Hero talents to me feel like convenants where abilities and power are tied to class identity choice
[2:10:43] grimblymcgoo: @dright424 How cool they seem isnt the problem. Its the fact that one spec choice will be the "best" and therefore "required"
[2:10:51] VeronicaRotal: i want Collossus to do literally *nothing else* than permanently increase my Tauren's size by 20 percent. Nothing else.
[2:10:56] Vaephera: Oracle was definitely making me wish for just ten more talent points instead. I have a feeling opinions will change once stuff gets refined a bit and people actually get to play them, but the way they're revealing them doesn't seem to be working
[2:11:00] keyboardturner: should i link the class skins concepts i made? PrideWave
[2:11:00] rowanoaken: It's like companies naming coloured pencils - the names don't effect the colour of the pencil and it just makes the pencil sell more - the class abilities don't play into the fantasy as much as the name  would suggest
[2:11:09] TinySp00k: Like Green Fire for WL?
[2:11:12] Togglegoggle: let my mechagnome priest cast cool hex-barriers and use more tech please
[2:11:13] TankenFunk: Power Word: Moonshield. Power Word: Moonpain tneEvi
[2:11:18] TownieTV: in the name of the moon they will punish you
[2:11:19] Harai_Ulfsark: @TinySp00k yes
[2:11:20] krisz49: OMG YES PLEASE!
[2:11:21] Thowarr: @TankenFunk some specs have that now; they'll recommend this talent option as "easier" to play, and this talent option which will be more dps but it's harder to pull off
[2:11:23] Arlaeya: Yes! this also works for shadow... moon phases. my headcanon for my nelf priest
[2:11:24] Slaaneshdonkey: i like that idea, but quite confusing for a new player
[2:11:31] saarkhastick: I'm a NElf BM Hunter and will be going Pack Leader. I can't picture how that will change. I was hoping for talents that maximize/buff/increase my use of my pets.
[2:11:38] Synth_San: Wouldn't be confusing to a new player, if that is what they come into
[2:11:42] Nulgar: @veronicarotal canonically accurate Tauren - in WC3 and the RPG books, Tauren are a good bit taller than in WoW, more like Ogres
[2:11:42] Stamps42: ah like blood elf pallies
[2:11:53] elbardo_ts: like green fire
[2:12:00] VeronicaRotal: @Nulgar they also used to have necks...
[2:12:00] keyboardturner: Paladins-specific: ***
[2:12:04] starthorium: people arent confused with ffxiv quest based unlocks so why would it be confusing?
[2:12:05] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel my class fantasy involves a Night Elf Mohawk, full time!
[2:12:08] keyboardturner: Other classes: ***
[2:12:12] elbardo_ts: class skins are like green fire for warlocks
[2:12:22] doon03: won’t that get normalized, lose its luster, quickly… like in a week or two
[2:12:34] Sorin__: I suppose if someone tells you to use a spell but you have a different spell name
[2:12:35] Nulgar: @keyboardturner did you try posting links? tneEvi
[2:12:51] Gulcius: Would be awesome to have troll druids without the Cenarion druids thematic
[2:12:54] TownieTV: green fire is life even after ten years.
[2:13:05] keyboardturner: @Nulgar monkaS oh are they gone?
[2:13:06] Synth_San: @Sorin__ I think it'll get sort of blended in, just like how everyone calls it "lust" when it has different names in the game
[2:13:07] ramzie0: Void Elf void pally please
[2:13:21] AlfredK: I would for sure
[2:13:37] Thowarr: @Gulcius still waiting for the rest of the races to be able to be druids
[2:13:40] literally_human_garbage: obv frostfire for mages
[2:13:46] Rabiahtaro132: Give monks differant color to their attacks based on which celestial they "train" under.
[2:13:49] MeggoArt: gimme kul tiran paladin tideguards
[2:14:00] Stamps42: bring plainsrunning back
[2:14:02] Phenroi: Kul Tiran sea shaman
[2:14:06] keyboardturner: did my links not go through
[2:14:09] netonkent: Priest would my favourite class by far if they brought Elune priest skins in
[2:14:15] XxJagershotxX: All I want is class skins for my paladin, I want to be a vengence boy
[2:14:17] starthorium: hemomancer would b cool for afflic lock
[2:14:18] Stamps42: need taurens getting on all fours to run
[2:14:19] TankenFunk: @keyboardturner I don't think anyone can post links in this chat
[2:14:20] Sockfire: It's an amazing idea. Probably a monumental level of work to do it right.
[2:14:21] TownieTV: i'd love for non-panderan monks to move away from the panderan aesthetic
[2:14:31] AlfredK: More importantly. When are we getting gnome druids?
[2:14:44] Nulgar: Not Cloth, just the same appearance as Mail, simple as that
[2:14:45] keyboardturner: some reddit posts of class skin concepts i made
[2:14:45] AngryInternetCat: Dark ranger is a classic
[2:14:57] WhirlwindAbyss: Do something like a War priest where you can use plate xmog, like Andy
[2:15:03] AngryInternetCat: Oh, gnome druids would be amazing
[2:15:14] Nulgar: And unarmed Worgen would just need invisible 1h & 2h weapon transmogs
[2:15:15] keyboardturner: every time i forget how to use twitch DMs lmao
[2:15:23] Gulcius: @WhirlwindAbyss Its called Paladin man...
[2:15:44] KayAitch96: What is the addon for the colored names above players? I need that <3
[2:15:47] JarJar_Brinkz: And your lightning bird is blue
[2:15:54] Sockfire: keyboardturner's concepts are amazing
[2:15:55] gabekan: Cool af
[2:16:05] Togglegoggle: is that all weakauras?
[2:16:14] Beorn_of_the_NorthernSea: Did you do that with Glyphs?!?
[2:16:32] KayAitch96: What is the addon for the colored names above players? I need that  <3
[2:16:42] WhirlwindAbyss: @Gulcius Similar, but lore wise would be different, so if we are doing stuff for class fantasy, why not let a priest have heavy armor for a mog?
[2:16:52] Thowarr: @KayAitch96 Plater
[2:16:57] cabeshpash: what armor set is that @TaliesinAndEvitel ?
[2:17:01] ramzie0: @KayAitch96 Plater is a good one
[2:17:12] keyboardturner: should be sent in DMs i think, not sure if twitch blocks that too tho
[2:17:14] JarJar_Brinkz: I find it's more appealing to actually do different things than the other skin
[2:17:19] Disjoint_Dwarf: I would love transmog to be opened up to all type - I want a Priest who can transmog into Pally armor, or a hunter who can wear Garrosh's shoulder. shaman wear Lei Shen's Helm, etc
[2:17:29] KayAitch96: @ramzie0 cant find it on curseforge
[2:17:44] KayAitch96: @Disjoint_Dwarf Wouldn't make sense..
[2:17:48] JarJar_Brinkz: I don't just want visual changes, i want them to be like hero classes tbh LUL
[2:17:49] AlfredK: More nature/green spells in balance spec
[2:17:59] Synth_San: Fully open xmog is something I've wanted since it came out LUL it doesn't change what the gear does that we are wearing, but it opens up sooo much more choice of style
[2:18:05] Heimthal: lmao I can see my character on your screen xD
[2:18:10] VeronicaRotal: i'm convinced Transmog is what keeps WoW afloat
[2:18:13] KayAitch96: @ramzie0 Is it Plater Nameplates?
[2:18:15] thunduz: please give me this
[2:18:18] flaccid_rage: Forsaken paladins!
[2:18:23] Thowarr: @KayAitch96 make sure you select the WoW specific page, but just type "plater" in the search bar. Pops right up
[2:18:31] Thowarr: @KayAitch96 Yes
[2:18:32] ropergaran: I always liked the idea of a dark knight that was a paladin but with shadow spells instead for forsaken
[2:18:38] doon03: I think it’s a super cool idea… but that doesn’t feel like an expansion feature, but just something cool they can add in the game
[2:18:43] elbardo_ts: i wished we could get a pandaren dh
[2:18:55] KayAitch96: @Thowarr Nice... got it
[2:19:09] WhirlwindAbyss: It would be cool if you could make a class skin that was profession based as well, like an Engi having some ability/effects changed to invole gadgets and such
[2:19:22] thunduz: does the type really matter these days?
[2:19:22] Saiyori: id leave the dmg type bc if you change it, it potentially could cause bis things
[2:19:24] literally_human_garbage: How relevant are damage types in the modern game?
[2:19:28] Thowarr: @KayAitch96 awesome; look at some YT videos on how to set things up. There's a ton of features, but just go slowly and you got it
[2:19:32] thunduz: ok you just answered lol
[2:19:37] TownieTV: blizz normalised the magic schools ages ago so it shouldn't matter anymore.
[2:19:41] grimblymcgoo: Dont paladins still get increased dmg against demons and undead?
[2:19:51] Lenitas: I remember the giant guards in nyalotha that were immune to astral damage, was not fun on my balance druid xD
[2:20:02] literally_human_garbage: I guess some classes have talents related to increasing damage type
[2:20:05] schlakt: mostly bad for pvp i guess
[2:20:07] elbardo_ts: it could matter for pvp
[2:20:08] Rabiahtaro132: Give void elf paladins, void attacks. Name the class skin Void Knight or something
[2:20:23] keyboardturner: Kappa makes them obsolete obviously
[2:20:31] BajaBlasta: they need visual parity
[2:20:36] Sockfire: These concepts are extremely compelling.
[2:20:40] AlfredK: Just use the default skin
[2:20:41] thunduz: is it wrong to say I wouldn't care lol
[2:20:48] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel when they write guides, they link to the spell ID so that icon appears on the guide
[2:20:51] Fortvila: make it a toggle ?
[2:20:53] TankenFunk: The people making guides will find a fix, it's okay tneEvi
[2:20:54] TownieTV: wowhead can work out logic based on talents in their guides so they could have you select which skin you use. shouldn't be a huge obstacle.
[2:20:59] Harai_Ulfsark: hmm like worgen still take 1% less shadow and nature damage, i guess you need to leave damage schools as it is
[2:21:08] butlerlog: could make there be an option to have spells show default effects when used by other players, otherwise it isn't compatible with pvp
[2:21:25] MxViolet: I think they should keep the spell names the same but give them visual differences
[2:21:25] WhirlwindAbyss: Easy fix where you can have the skin name on the icon, then the tooltip gives the skin name and base name
[2:21:27] elbardo_ts: they already do something similar with rotation guides that let you check different talents
[2:21:30] kaijoe_: I mean, to be fair, it also increases the work on Blizz to make sure they're tracking the different names back to the one spell that is being buffed/nerfed or whatever, right?
[2:21:44] thunduz: I kind of wish I never saw this
[2:21:54] PinkSharkie: Ugh that would all be so awesome to have in the game :((
[2:21:58] VeronicaRotal: question: would this be opt-outable in your idea?
[2:21:58] MeggoArt: tideguards... tneEviHeart
[2:22:06] keyboardturner: Kappa
[2:22:09] thunduz: these are so damn cool
[2:22:27] Saiyori: god these are amazing
[2:22:50] Rico_Azzarash: I would love to attone all my shaman skills to water element  (
[2:22:51] keyboardturner: Some of these are cross-class
[2:22:52] Merex760: This feels like a thing that would be added for a WoW 2 when the game isn't as bloated. There are just so many races, classes, specializations. Seems like an unrealistic task for the devs
[2:23:04] elbardo_ts: i wonder what you could do with bm and survival hunter, if there's anything
[2:23:04] Gulcius: Not the necromancer I wanted but would be VERY HAPPY
[2:23:10] thunduz: @TaliesinAndEvitel check my twitch whisper
[2:23:22] Rabiahtaro132: Unlock and toggle
[2:23:26] TankenFunk: I think some skins could be race specific, while others not
[2:24:05] butlerlog: there are so many spell effects that are only used by enemy spells in dungeons and questing that could be pilfered for these
[2:24:25] CeasiusPls: Makes me think of Allods, not a great game, but they had class Archetypes and then every race had a different title and theme for the class
[2:24:52] dastago: what do you think the chances are they change hero talents to actually do something like this?
[2:24:58] GameingAspect: fk yes
[2:24:59] Sockfire: Well done, keyboardturner, these are amazing
[2:25:06] Hippwn: These are cool but I don't see this stuff happening
[2:25:12] AngryInternetCat: So cool!
[2:25:22] LilyOfTremere: Were there a shaman one somewhere? Did I miss it? :(
[2:25:26] TownieTV: maybe blizz can't do class skins because the community has gone so far into developing these ideas.
[2:25:27] TankenFunk: @dastago Probably wouldn't be done for TWW, so it won't happen tneTaliCry Better to hope for something like this in the future
[2:25:30] WhirlwindAbyss: So have your unlockable class skin be something like heritage armor, unlocks with max lev, or you can have some special things tied to things like covenants or professions
[2:25:34] keyboardturner: OSFrog
[2:26:06] AlfredK: Are they planning for the hero talents to be an evergreen feature?
[2:26:18] thunduz: I want those so much!
[2:26:34] butlerlog: I understand they aren't, but I will always be wishing they had been.
[2:26:34] dastago: off topic but what addon is it which shows player names like that?
[2:26:38] JarJar_Brinkz: I just like the idea of having fun different spells to play around with
[2:26:48] keyboardturner: there are some valid points against it I think, but they are solvable - like for example, in ffxiv, the Dark Knight I often run away from their AoE even though it won't hurt me because I feel like it's a damage AoE ability
[2:27:03] thunduz: really?
[2:27:07] thunduz: why?
[2:27:18] heeyalex: @thunduz Thank you for give me a sub to @TaliesinAndEvitel tneEviHeart tneWineTime
[2:27:38] Harai_Ulfsark: @keyboardturner that's me running away from defile when it was introduced
[2:27:41] butlerlog: But if there is one that you never spec into, and you unlock all talents rather than choosing talents, then its just a set of extra powers with a theme you didn't choose
[2:27:44] Saiyori: Thoughts if they were to do class skins but as shop items?
[2:27:51] Rabiahtaro132: They have to use a talent tree that they dont like using abilities they wanted to avoid.
[2:27:52] thunduz: @heeyalex you are welcome. enjoy your no ads and emote use lol
[2:28:00] ebrahim_91: Dark Ranger is nice too, but like if it were up 2 me they would have been class skins
[2:28:04] Gulcius: Like Primal Wave for Shamans, I just loved the Necrolords, but HATED the Pirmal wave
[2:28:04] keyboardturner: @keyboardturner exactly @Harai_Ulfsark NotLikeThis
[2:28:12] Harai_Ulfsark: @Saiyori no, it needs to be obtained ingame like the green fire
[2:28:13] Lenitas: The druid one they showed aswell, summoning trees isn't a lot of fun for either spec
[2:28:17] JarJar_Brinkz: So pretty much, 3% of the playerbase is affected Kappa
[2:28:24] ebrahim_91: @keyboardturner your class skins idea before on twitter were 10000/10
[2:28:27] caradosailanthus: I have that problem with some of the tier bonuses that require specific talents to work.
[2:28:30] krisz49: as a main holy priest for 10 years, I hate the oracle ones...
[2:28:31] GameingAspect: shown evoker hero talents yet?
[2:28:35] Gulcius: Still hates primal wave today, and the fact that the new Tier only works with primal wave
[2:28:38] kaijoe_: But see, I love the idea of summoning trees on my balance.
[2:28:39] keyboardturner: you know I did make a rogue and druid one but idk where they got lost in the post
[2:28:49] Harai_Ulfsark: @GameingAspect i think they released chronowarden?
[2:29:05] Saiyori: @Harai_Ulfsark i totally agree it should, but I was just wondering opinions if they did do that
[2:29:11] Thowarr: @Lenitas That was all resto, with a smattering of balance thrown in; it's like if you'd like to have your healing spec do more dps, here you go
[2:29:45] mrmanno14: covenant drama all over again
[2:29:48] OatsMate: I wonder if you can choose to just not use hero talents.
[2:30:06] keyboardturner: i'm probably gonna enjoy whatever gameplay changes they make, if dragonflight is any indication
[2:30:15] Lenitas: @Thowarr RN with the tier I'm already locked in to grove guardian and I am not looking forward to having that "optional ability" for an entire expac or being locked in to the other resto tree :/
[2:30:34] ebrahim_91: I'm going to have so much fun as a Dark Ranger
[2:30:36] mrmanno14: orc hunters going to be miserable as dark rangers and sentinels lolol
[2:30:50] Nulgar: Like the overblown Covenant complaints, when people demanded a "ripcord" before the expansion even launched
[2:30:56] JarJar_Brinkz: The criticisms are 100% valid, but I'm gonna enjoy playing my sanlayn
[2:31:01] GameingAspect: were hero talents a old conept like path of the titans?
[2:31:04] OatsMate: It's gonna be weird having a gnome dark ranger...
[2:31:07] AngryInternetCat: Blizzard has a story of sticking to unpopular decisions
[2:31:07] keyboardturner: i still have no idea what a fatebringer rogue could possibly even be, or any of the rogue ones for that matter
[2:31:18] Ryylar: Ryylar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:31:18] AngryInternetCat: History*
[2:31:19] Heimthal: I am a little sad I cannot be a BM sentinel hunter
[2:31:20] kaijoe_: Yeah, but it happened with DF too. Community lost it about Soar and other shit like that. Feels like this is just now part of the expansion cycle, unfortunately.
[2:31:32] Thowarr: @Lenitas Totally understand; balance druids were looking forward to Orbital Strike before pvp'ers took it back
[2:31:36] butlerlog: night elf hunters needing to raise undead skeletons to keep up with their raid's dps
[2:31:37] bladestitch: Do you think they should avoid trying new things like this?
[2:31:39] Thoreya: what do we want to change about hero talents? at this point
[2:31:42] kaijoe_: No I agree.
[2:32:02] Dazzaw17: as an orc hunter, im praying the pack leader tree is good is all ill say LUL
[2:32:07] kaijoe_: The community are just going to find ANYTHING to pick as THE thing to panic about.
[2:32:12] Lenitas: I love my druid so much but if they don't redo the class tree for the next expansion, with the way grove keeper looks, I think I might have to shelf them and find another class :(
[2:32:30] thunduz: I was more upset about my evoker lack of visual armor than soar
[2:32:32] CeasiusPls: They tried, bless them
[2:32:36] saarkhastick: Soar should have always been the Evoker equiv. of druid flight form
[2:32:42] thunduz: but I do love that soar is dragonriding now
[2:32:46] alextheblight: Clap
[2:32:50] Ryylar: yep exporting now
[2:32:51] Rico_Azzarash: HEEEEY! :3
[2:32:52] Ryylar: lol
[2:32:52] krisz49: do u think we will get player housing in some form?
[2:32:52] Arlaeya: clapclapclapclap!

[2:33:09] HSAyril: tneDorkthyr

[2:33:43] JarJar_Brinkz: @saarkhastick their wings are small as hell
[2:33:46] beohoof: F
[2:33:49] bladestitch: Never done a key higher than 18.
[2:33:50] Daetroxe: When I heard you can be a dark ranger I new I would play it even if icy veins tells me it's shit. I think that means Blizz did something right. =)
[2:33:54] JMcGhee559: <insert snarky joke about penguins having wings and not flying>
[2:33:57] urbenjames: yeah
[2:33:57] GameingAspect: yup
[2:34:00] KatieRet_: Sure!
[2:34:09] blaisle: More like +15
[2:34:19] bladestitch: Cheese
[2:34:21] OatsMate: Tali's group
[2:34:36] saarkhastick: @JMcGhee559 true but they swim super fast
[2:34:40] Thowarr: @Lenitas Balance has a whole lot of issues, in terms of survivability and dps. I'm leveling a fire mage because they always have their issues resolved in a timely matter. It is what it is
[2:34:45] ebrahim_91: I am so tempted LOL
[2:34:46] SpeciousArgument: all I hope to get from hero talents, is for my spec to play slightly different, and for it to be visible in game
[2:35:13] HSAyril: Ice veins is awful lol
[2:35:22] JarJar_Brinkz: @Daetroxe Same tho, get me in there
[2:35:24] alextheblight: oh dang, IV is what I use
[2:35:25] TinySp00k: I took that personally Kappa
[2:35:35] MrGM: 109 raiders from MrGM have joined! 
[2:35:44] Daetroxe: @JarJar_Brinkz :D
[2:35:47] JarJar_Brinkz: MrGM iacoSway
[2:35:48] Lenitas: @Thowarr Yeah, I'm mainly playing resto and guardian RN, but comparing Guardian utility to other tanks (pala/dh specifically)  I just feel so much worse on the druid
[2:35:52] OatsMate: Frostfire is interesting, but not sure if it's good.
[2:35:54] butlerlog: yeah one of the things i learned over dragonflight is those internet guides are often pretty bad and or even wrong and if you want actual advice the class discords are the only place to find it
[2:35:54] mrmanno14: still so many specs and classes require attention to their trees, worried that hero talents ignore or expand some fundamental issues
[2:35:57] MrGM: The War Within is dead
[2:35:58] Sockfire: frostfire mages with an easy W
[2:36:05] thunduz: the legend @MrGM
[2:36:06] mrtibbs2013: hello
[2:36:06] Triskelian: @ebrahim_91 I don't even know what you're talking about, but DO EET!!!
[2:36:17] thunduz: thunduz gifted a Tier 1 sub to MrGM! 
[2:36:24] JarJar_Brinkz: I guess we'll just go play the new FF xpac instead
[2:36:30] JarJar_Brinkz: Surely that's not dead
[2:36:40] MrGM: this is true! level 40 hasnt been as good as 25
[2:36:46] thunduz: the very least I can do for @MrGM
[2:36:46] onathehunter: I’m on NA or I’d join
[2:36:50] Thowarr: @Lenitas Yup; this season, again, helped expose the lack of overall kit that Guardian has versus basically every other tank
[2:36:50] MrGM: @thunduz Thanks for the gift sub! <3
[2:37:02] saarkhastick: I'm wicked bullshit DPS but on NA :)
[2:37:16] JarJar_Brinkz: Meta probably took over, no more fun involved!
[2:37:28] Thowarr: @Lenitas It's also akin to dps warrior versus just about every other class atm. I'm also looking at ret pallies specifically
[2:37:31] urbenjames: i cry
[2:37:40] SamuraiWillZ916: can you request evi to use her BDE and tell blizz to bring the shammy tank in from SoD to retail please
[2:37:42] thunduz: anything good?
[2:37:52] aeson_of_raid_sock: tali won’t play N.A. because of our cheese
[2:37:53] butlerlog: probably several months LUL
[2:37:53] JMcGhee559: @Lenitas while the point about guardian kit is true, in the end it's typically about balance (hehe) last season they were the best tanks etc etc
[2:37:56] MrGM: it definitley needed something extra this phase but its all good, I think I just played way too much during p1
[2:37:57] Lenitas: @Thowarr It's so wild when pallies complain to me about how good druid is compared to them xD
[2:38:11] thunduz: tneRedGear tneRedGear tneRedGear tneRedGear
[2:38:44] madszh: Hey how is the roof situation going?
[2:38:51] Nulgar: Rise is latter half
[2:38:52] AngryInternetCat: Space banjo
[2:38:54] Lenitas: @JMcGhee559 Yeah survivability and damage out weigh utility (plus mark of the wild is always good to have), but it still feels so limited RN
[2:38:59] JarJar_Brinkz: KKona
[2:39:02] CeasiusPls: So outer wilds?
[2:39:05] Durwen: are you wearing your gathering gloves?
[2:39:08] ropergaran: w
[2:39:09] boomshroom: cosmic
[2:39:14] Daetroxe: WTF! LMAO! XD
[2:39:20] saarkhastick: Flight of the Cosmic Hippo by Bela Fleck = Space Banjo!
[2:39:24] Nulgar: Oh, could you link that? (again?)
[2:39:29] butlerlog: @MrGM I agree on the whole, but I do think gnomeregan is a big step up in quality from the decent BFD, and when it works I enjoy STV
[2:39:34] Daetroxe: It's alright.
[2:39:35] Thowarr: @Lenitas Yup; for tanking it's just night and day. This season, hpal has finally been knocked down a few pegs, but as far as dps? Lord.
[2:39:55] Travnar: catJAM
[2:40:35] Lenitas: @Thowarr Oh yeah and it's also always rets that are complaining to me about druids xD
[2:41:01] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[2:41:10] CeasiusPls: Space Banjo is a good name for Outer Wilds OST
[2:41:25] Arlaeya: Space Banjo FTW
[2:41:49] Rico_Azzarash: at least you in right spec this time xDDD
[2:41:55] CobaltisTV: can you run out and change your gear rq?
[2:42:00] mendax55: anyone else hear that buzz or was it me?
[2:42:08] TankenFunk: Did you equip your weapon, Tali?
[2:42:12] Thowarr: @Lenitas The buffs they got were insane; with the exception of the highest keys, and even that's a bit iffy, ret pally is just absolute banger. IT's why you saw them as the fourth dps this weekend in the MDI, and you'll see it again this weekend
[2:42:35] mendax55: ok haha! thought it was my speaker
[2:42:35] Thowarr: Great dps, great utility, good survivability... like, c'mon now
[2:43:07] rowanoaken: I'm loving it already
[2:43:22] alextheblight: hell yeah
[2:43:25] keyboardturner: ret is incredibly fun right now
[2:43:28] alextheblight: oh
[2:44:05] alextheblight: sounds fine
[2:44:07] Sockfire: they are fine
[2:44:09] Lenitas: @Thowarr It's wild when they talk about how balance druid is so good in really high keys, but like I have no reason to go above 20? I'd rather just bring another alt up to get all the portals then go over 20 xD
[2:44:34] boomshroom: I dunno man, think the buzzing noise is better than the banjo
[2:44:38] Cynders94: soak missed
[2:44:39] Phenroi: Someone didn't get in the soak
[2:44:39] madszh: N one soaked
[2:44:42] caradosailanthus: Missed the soak
[2:44:43] cosmopanda13: soak
[2:44:56] treavorthenusance: LUL
[2:44:57] Stamps42: someone always misses the little soak puddle after the big circle
[2:45:07] mrmanno14: +23 is a learning key
[2:45:12] Triskelian: Streamer Affix is in effect :D
[2:45:18] TankenFunk: Remember! It is ALWAYS the healer's fault tneEvi
[2:45:26] Daetroxe: Same, never seen it.
[2:45:37] Thowarr: @Lenitas Yeah, in high keys it's a different thing entirely; things live long enough to finally give balance the ability to get full dps value, but def the majority of the playerbase isn't there. Plus you can still get title with either class, it's jsut going to be easier with a ret pal
[2:45:37] Nulgar: This sounds like a remix of "Timber Hearth"
[2:45:42] TownieTV: not a thing you forget though
[2:45:43] cosmopanda13: think you just got lucky with your pugs
[2:45:46] Triskelian: @tankenfunk This! :D
[2:47:08] Lenitas: @Thowarr Yup exactly, and like I said before I cap at 20s cause I don't enjoy M+ enough to go beyond the level of highest rewards
[2:47:10] Thowarr: @Lenitas If you go to mythicstats dot com, and look at the top 2k m+ runs for each week, ret has always been strong this season. And with the buffs, it solidified a perm m+ spot
[2:47:22] XxJagershotxX: really not a fan of this fight, the attack it does on the tank hurts so much
[2:47:36] mrmanno14: what’s your raid frames look like?
[2:47:59] mrmanno14: for 10+ ppl
[2:48:19] Saevash: adds here hurt a lot watchout
[2:48:39] Thowarr: @Lenitas I got both of my toons to 3.2k+ and have basically stopped because I'm spending most of my time in queue just not doing anything, as the keys at the 25 level have turned into specific comps. And neither of my toons (balance/fury) really fit that bill
[2:48:41] Lenitas: I would use default raid frames, but they're so bad at tracking druid HoTs and I prefer the full plate to change colour with dispelable debuffs
[2:49:22] schlakt: the space banjo behind normuzond speaking is kinda fitting
[2:49:36] Lenitas: Yeah as druid I just need to track like 4+ hots on the same target some times
[2:49:56] Lenitas: And just having the whole plate turn purple when they're cursed is great
[2:50:16] blumberquack: @schlakt Darkest self be damned, that boy can fiddle a banjo
[2:50:21] Nulgar: I hate when hostile nameplates are green, and when missing health on friendlies shows as a _filling_ bar
[2:50:24] Lenitas: @Thowarr Yeah I don't really pug, just do guild runs, except to fill some spots when guild doesn't have enough people online
[2:50:40] boomshroom: the sub culture, future banjo is fuckin nuts
[2:50:42] tandemshoehorns: Very relaxing. Probably wouldn't want to see it live, though.
[2:51:16] Daetroxe: Did you ever heal as an Evoker?
[2:51:19] iamdrewonline: why do we not see green healing numbers?
[2:51:25] Arlaeya: Space banjo is for sipping moonshine at your moon-based outpost
[2:51:26] jskillz777: repair
[2:52:23] whereare20yoblondewomen: @taliesinandevitel you are an ideologue and you will seeth when daddy Trump Doms the 2024 election. You evil marxist ideologues will seeth!
[2:52:51] Nulgar: @whereare20yoblondewomen aww, how cute
[2:52:57] alextheblight: seethe*

[2:53:22] iRegretn0thing: Isnt dom a lgbt aligned term nowadays?
[2:53:30] iilu: I can see why the 20 year old blonde women hide from this guy
[2:53:34] Thowarr: @Lenitas I had a group last season, but it fell apart this season so it was back to pugging.
[2:53:37] whereare20yoblondewomen: Liberals aka extreme leftists with no critical thinking, pure narcicism
[2:53:43] HSAyril: If we're getting political, I always love seeing the news stories about "caravans from mexico" every election year, and the story magically goes away after election day
[2:53:51] iRegretn0thing: this guy sounds muffled from how deep in the closet they might be
[2:54:01] Trebled_Mind: tneTrundleMaldini tneTrundleMaldini
[2:54:06] named_marcel: Isn't Trump BFF woth Russia or something, maybe Trump is a Marxist.
[2:54:26] anaplia: @whereare20yoblondewomen *narcissism
[2:54:35] JarJar_Brinkz: @whereare20yoblondewomen Oh god, you forgot to unlink your main from your troll account.......
[2:54:57] Daetroxe: I though you need to go right, not left.
[2:55:01] ronox9: Going right is always the way
[2:55:10] Lenitas: @Thowarr Ah damn that sucks. I usually break at least a season anytime I have to find a new guild :/
[2:55:12] JarJar_Brinkz: That boos looks epic
[2:55:20] Nulgar: @whereare20yoblondewomen haha the sheer irony tneEvi
[2:55:26] ronox9: always behind the slow orbs
[2:55:27] Sockfire: go behind the wave as it spawns
[2:55:27] Stamps42: Looking at this UI reminds me that Moira needs a disc priest skin.
[2:55:29] Daetroxe: Yes, stay close and go right.
[2:55:34] ronox9: betwen boss and orbs
[2:55:35] nasasam: much easier to manage the balls when going right
[2:55:47] annettebrr: people say go right all the time and I find it way easier to go left
[2:56:02] Nulgar: @whereare20yoblondewomen I mean, everything in the US reeks of narcissism, so that doesn't mean much
[2:56:18] blumberquack: @whereare20yoblondewomen that's a little extreme don't you think? Kappa
[2:56:24] Thowarr: @Lenitas Yeah, understandable
[2:56:32] Sharktribe: @whereare20yoblondewomen XD loooooser kid who needs attention up in here
[2:56:32] flaccid_rage: @whereare20yoblondewomen incel detected, opinion rejected
[2:56:37] Yodamoo: Someone might wanna ban this dude? 😅
[2:56:41] named_marcel: @whereare20yoblondewomen Who hurt you?
[2:56:52] HSAyril: Tali is a man of talent, running M+ and posting on IG at the same time
[2:57:00] plopsmurf: telli is a communist
[2:57:02] Deatheran: Us leftists... "we want rights for all workers" apparently that's objectionable LUL
[2:57:03] Sharktribe: @whereare20yoblondewomen zzzzz do better
[2:57:09] alextheblight: weak bait
[2:57:15] misterstimpak: @whereare20yoblondewomen Oh really? That seems like a credible threat. I'm going to go ahead and make sure the FBI is aware of this as making threats over the internet is a federal offense.
[2:57:17] Yodamoo: FBI Check?
[2:57:25] HSAyril: The username sounds comedic on purpose lol
[2:57:34] KatieRet_: jump off then release
[2:57:35] Daetroxe: He tried though. :P
[2:57:36] Baron_Colvin: No
[2:57:37] ActuallyArcane: @Yodamoo Any FBI in Chat?
[2:57:40] plopsmurf: can you confirm you are a communist?
[2:57:41] Lenitas: @whereare20yoblondewomen Mate you called liberals extreme leftists xD
[2:57:49] onathehunter: need a warlock there :)
[2:57:49] blumberquack: @ActuallyArcane I cannot confirm or deny this claim.
[2:57:54] JarJar_Brinkz: You see what happens when you claim Spaghetti bolognese?
[2:58:05] ActuallyArcane: luxthoSus
[2:58:20] Yodamoo: No FBI in Tali stream... They really dropping the ball...
[2:58:24] Lenitas: @whereare20yoblondewomen Cute
[2:58:25] JarJar_Brinkz: LUL
[2:59:36] plopsmurf: can you confirm you are a communist? @TaliesinAndEvitel
[2:59:44] Thowarr: The origins of the dish are unclear, but it may have evolved in the context of early twentieth-century emigration of southern Italians to the Americas (particularly the United States) as a sort of fusion influenced by the tomato-rich style of Neapolitan ragù or it may have developed in immigrant restaurants in Britain in the post war era.[27]
[2:59:54] MxViolet: Chef Boyardee invented it :P
[2:59:57] flaccid_rage: The English just really want to be French, but barring that they will take Italian, or indian or whatever
[3:00:12] Thowarr: They took Indian :P
[3:00:16] keyboardturner: Lechonk ConcernDoge
[3:00:16] ArcavusX: Good call
[3:00:29] keyboardturner: i forgot i put lechonk in my message and never sent
[3:00:39] Yodamoo: Yeah that's why I suggested it... I don't get offended, just didn't want the stream in trouble 😅
[3:01:01] Trebled_Mind: guy seemed like he looked up a list of right wing buzz phrases and decided to bring them into a twitch chat lol.
[3:01:29] chockoholick: Talie  why are you so against stupid people.  If it wasn't for stupid people where would we get the politicians ?
[3:01:45] skeletonetiquette: Can you believe Tali banned me? All I dead was threaten to murder an undisclosed amount of people. /eyeroll
[3:01:52] keyboardturner: apparently we don't have an actual solid confirmation on the origin of the hamburger, it's some controversy and apparently it boils down to either the US or Germany (ie Hamburg)
[3:02:04] misterstimpak: Well.. I haven't been told to kill myself in a while by a 12 year old.
[3:02:38] JarJar_Brinkz: @misterstimpak Sadly, that wasn't a 12 year old. It was a fully grown adult acting out LUL
[3:02:42] iilu: I think he recently bought The 2010 Big Book of Bait Phrases and wanted to test them out
[3:02:44] plopsmurf: you would get killed
[3:03:19] plopsmurf: if you worked for the people
[3:03:22] Nulgar: he googled "how to meet cute FBI agents"
[3:03:23] chockoholick: a tiny bit more vers   or  lets just put it out there you could of healed yourself
[3:03:23] Daetroxe: I would say there more just opportunist. :P
[3:03:26] Trebled_Mind: @jarjar_brinkz Fully grown adult that may have suffered recent brain injury.
[3:03:27] Heimthal: you can fear the necroforst
[3:03:37] tandemshoehorns: @JarJar_Brinkz Apparently, not Fully grown.
[3:03:47] CorsairCarl: I've solved it, the 10.2.6 is we 'pirate' an idea from another game and add player housing to WoW! XD
[3:03:52] Heimthal: priest tech
[3:04:25] keyboardturner: @CorsairCarl I hope we steal it from Wildstar then
[3:04:45] caradosailanthus: Just have the paladin use Divine Intervention to wipe protect =P
[3:05:02] hexen109: Tali is there any chance Blizz adds more classes to Dracthyr?
[3:05:06] Daetroxe: I could not heal a 20 and stream at the same time, GJ mate.
[3:05:09] treavorthenusance: pirate patch will just be metzen in a leather daddy outfit with an eyepatch. 10/10
[3:05:11] JarJar_Brinkz: @tandemshoehorns No, no, fully grown. That way when the FBI snatch him they won't have any doubts about whether he was in his right mind or not tneTaliDD
[3:05:17] CorsairCarl: I dunno how I feel about Priests getting what is essentially Rolle The Bones
[3:05:18] purpformance: look at tali doin a big boi key
[3:05:23] Sharktribe: glad the space banjo is back
[3:05:26] keyboardturner: Dragonriding was stolen from Guild Wars 2 obviously, therefore Dragonflight has been a pirate expansion tneKragwa
[3:05:30] siggyfisk: Y tneMovEEE -HAW
[3:05:32] named_marcel: @keyboardturner As a German I can say, the area around Hamburg isn't famous for barbecues... mor fore "fish-related" dishes. So maybe a German immigrant in the U.S. combined barbecue and German habbit of eating bread/sandwiches as dinner?
[3:05:41] sandpigeon: yeah you should be good
[3:05:56] keyboardturner: @keyboardturner that seems like a pretty sound reason @named_marcel
[3:06:06] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel GO START THE RP
[3:06:24] Daetroxe: Did he just do a leeroy jenkins?
[3:06:52] JarJar_Brinkz: Tali can you give us any hints about this pirate secret
[3:06:57] JarJar_Brinkz: tneTaliShill
[3:07:00] misterstimpak: @misterstimpak Oh, I know their physical age is older than 12, but I'm talking about their mentality.
[3:07:05] keyboardturner: that's gross, you should totally wipe
[3:07:08] keyboardturner: Kappa
[3:07:10] Heimthal: yeah, its like the knot of snakes in temple of sethralis
[3:07:18] Daetroxe: Yes tell us about the pirate secret!
[3:07:37] siggyfisk: hate vines
[3:07:44] siggyfisk: did that as well
[3:07:46] Haelix87: well thats unfortunate
[3:07:47] Sockfire: need to get that paladin to freedom you
[3:07:54] alexandersaaranen: fade :) with phantasm
[3:07:54] caradosailanthus: Stand in this small space, but run out at the same time
[3:07:54] keyboardturner: "guess i'll die"
[3:07:54] plopsmurf: pop the dome
[3:08:00] sky_oak: pala in your group ?
[3:08:00] TownieTV: take the vine stun on the chin
[3:08:12] skeletonetiquette: I think fade breaks snares yeah?
[3:08:15] sky_oak: freedom
[3:08:16] keyboardturner: if fade has a root break then yeah

[3:09:52] plopsmurf: I had no idea healers needed to heal chromie in this fight LUL

[3:10:37] caradosailanthus: This is a lot better than 17 FPS Affix
[3:10:45] sky_oak: you will make it easy
[3:11:01] jskillz777: 1 less person
[3:11:03] Lenitas: You need everyone alive to soak there
[3:11:03] Noznatation: dmg is hard to survive when 1 person is dead
[3:11:03] keyboardturner: soak requires 5 players or else you take big damage
[3:11:08] Sockfire: vers too low
[3:11:08] sky_oak: lol /facepalm
[3:11:09] jskillz777: u need everyone
[3:11:19] eternitycrystal: more shields?
[3:11:19] Nulgar: 1min, enough time
[3:11:22] Noznatation: yeah it hurts silly when u are only 4
[3:11:52] skeletonetiquette: What level is the key?
[3:11:55] Elembry_us: You can get through that with one party member dead. Sometimes the tank is in the soak, but on the edge and it registers as them not being in the soak. It's literal shit.
[3:11:56] TownieTV: just kill it in 30 seconds. ez
[3:12:41] skeletonetiquette: Looks like either a 21, 22 or 23
[3:12:56] TownieTV: i think i may make a weakaura to have chromie say "i feel a surge of energy" when i pop cooldowns
[3:13:02] mdeckTV: 23, it shows right under the minimap
[3:13:13] HSAyril: Fuckin' rip

[3:13:43] jskillz777: i hate disc healing this dungeon its so tough
[3:13:46] wanik90: Laughs in druid
[3:13:49] skeletonetiquette: @mdecktv yea just on mobile so I can't see it clearly
[3:13:52] rowanoaken: You all need to be paladins with blessing of freedom lmao
[3:13:59] Sockfire: when i play ret i macro the healer to Blessing of Freedom, becomes a non-affix for them
[3:14:02] plopsmurf: yeah i know, rip
[3:14:20] vlaovich88: I miss my scuba sounds
[3:14:31] mdeckTV: @skeletonetiquette gotcha! makes more sense ^.^
[3:14:45] Noznatation: nah it hurts
[3:14:45] RoboticUnicorn007: Stand right on Chromie
[3:15:01] cosmopanda13: is your gear broken it was weird that you died there
[3:15:10] Heimthal: do you have the fade defensive that removes snares ?
[3:15:20] Noznatation: yeah yeah there was nothing wrong - it is a matter of dmg reduction and output at that point
[3:15:29] keyboardturner: there's a "repair!" text in your screen 👀
[3:15:32] plopsmurf: they doing it PogChamp
[3:15:39] Daetroxe: You got it though.
[3:15:40] onathehunter: everyone using their personals?
[3:15:44] jskillz777: no hes fully repaired
[3:15:52] RoboticUnicorn007: I havehad izsues with this one before, so i stand right on Chromie
[3:15:55] Sharktribe: What level key is it
[3:16:00] Yodamoo: Dispersion is all I can think of
[3:16:19] sky_oak: you broke the game
[3:16:22] Noznatation: everyone pot the 2nd charge
[3:16:25] Heimthal: @Yodamoo disc doesnt have
[3:16:27] jimio0: Get the ret to freedom you - should be running double freedom on entangling weeks
[3:16:31] Phenroi: bubble?
[3:16:33] Heimthal: PS youself
[3:16:39] Yodamoo: Oh damn
[3:16:42] Heimthal: only thing really
[3:16:45] RoboticUnicorn007: Maybe the warrior shout?
[3:16:54] wanik90: Talent is phantasm to remove snares with fade
[3:16:59] XxJagershotxX: can I just say, from a lore point pov, can we imagine just how much of a hardarse iridikron is that we sit here struggling to get him to 85% health
[3:17:01] Heimthal: rally and ps
[3:17:09] iRegretn0thing: IRIDDY DIDDY
[3:17:18] BlueeagleWoW: Could ask for rally on 1st and 2nd soaks, and then have your bubble for third just to have an overall DR
[3:17:53] RoboticUnicorn007: Yes
[3:17:57] onathehunter: everyone needs to use their def on the second one
[3:18:11] plopsmurf: 2 more times, you got this
[3:18:20] saarkhastick: It will never not bug me that Chromie sounds like the Warner sister, Dot.
[3:18:24] adam3comp: on the bright side and there is one, thematically this is very good since Iridikron is near unstoppable
[3:18:43] cosmopanda13: you have two warrios with shout it shoud be fine
[3:18:43] Noznatation: hunter can survive it himself
[3:18:44] TownieTV: everyone should be doing personals on the soak
[3:18:45] RoboticUnicorn007: Rallying cry
[3:18:46] Noznatation: pala too
[3:18:52] Noznatation: warrior should honestly be fine too
[3:19:01] oger421: dont you have the mass bubble?
[3:19:03] Heimthal: aslong as the main character survives the show goes on
[3:19:14] whisperlude: heal chromie
[3:19:16] sky_oak: and now you made it look easy hmmmmmmm
[3:19:22] sky_oak: hahaha
[3:19:43] plopsmurf: petri flask
[3:19:50] TownieTV: chromie!
[3:20:29] Heimthal: thats what keys over 20 are about living, and practice
[3:20:35] rowanoaken: gg :)
[3:20:35] jskillz777: that is a terrible fight
[3:21:02] sky_oak: ppl dont see half of whats there
[3:21:07] Lenitas: I once had someone run out of my darkness on first boss in BRH because they thought it was a boss mechanic xD
[3:21:18] jskillz777: i love waycrest
[3:21:21] Noznatation: The only part I dislike about it, is how impossible it is to survive the dmg part if you are only 4.
[3:21:39] Sharktribe: Waycrest is just a thematic, wonderful quintessential dungeon.
[3:21:48] TownieTV: you could have not finished
[3:22:13] plopsmurf: Atal is goated
[3:22:16] adam3comp: dm Ion and make him change it or say mean things about hero talents
[3:22:24] Heimthal: the carnage is dripping through the floor boards
[3:22:33] Saiyori: if you step out and back in, as long as someone is in the instance while a key is running, you can change armor and talents
[3:22:41] sky_oak: season 3 is still on easy mode
[3:23:16] oger421: cant you talk to the portal chick to change it?
[3:23:20] Yodamoo: Could run a quick 2 to swap keys at the end 😅
[3:23:36] Lenitas: @Yodamoo No you need to time a key of same level or higher to swap
[3:23:37] jimbowheat: those staircases in that place with these affixes scare me
[3:23:48] Yodamoo: Oh damn lol
[3:24:02] Alkey29: i get bad anxiety when doing hard content... the most ive done was 16 i cant imagine doing higher
[3:24:48] thunduz: oh I got that 100%
[3:25:09] plopsmurf: you doing the same dungeon again?
[3:25:16] NeeK_23: there are communities out there to help pug but without that toxicity
[3:25:35] plopsmurf: dont forget gear switch
[3:25:41] Bambiprsi: youve done fall now
[3:25:42] thunduz: that’s why I don’t pug with tali. I mean the ilvl plays a part but you know
[3:26:05] Alkey29: i have bad self esteem...so i get so sad when people insult me for fucking up
[3:26:06] ApolloRache: We have talked about ER yet?
[3:26:13] ApolloRache: Nice music btw
[3:26:13] Phenroi: Most of he pugs I've been in have been really good
[3:26:14] jimio0: I can be toxic in keys if you want that experience
[3:26:14] Sharktribe: I've been pugging since 2006, it's got ups and downs
[3:26:16] adam3comp: Kalecgos has been spreading the power of friendship successfully
[3:26:29] caradosailanthus: I've had some crap groups that just fail, but the toxicity has not been there
[3:26:30] Daetroxe: Not as bad as PvP for sure.
[3:26:37] KatieRet_: just getting a cuppa - which key we doing?
[3:27:08] Bambiprsi: youve done galakronds fall, not rise
[3:27:09] Phenroi: FALL, not rise
[3:27:09] vlaovich88: Switch your gear
[3:27:18] ApolloRache: I hope the dlc change depending on the ending we got in the base game
[3:27:30] KatieRet_: of course:)
[3:27:44] jimio0: Thats what i said - stupid naming
[3:27:50] Alkey29: i just want to repeat the keys over and over so i get used to mechanics... once mechanics are known u can focus on your class.
[3:27:52] cosmopanda13: good point don't forget your gear!
[3:28:08] Arlaeya: I'm glad it's not just me that gets confused by Murazond rising at the end of that!
[3:28:37] adam3comp: strummer skill gooooooooo
[3:28:42] XxJagershotxX: I don’t think it well because it’ll be playable before the end of the game, entrance obviously looks like touching miquella after defeating mogh
[3:29:19] onathehunter: that should’ve been a deneuser fail
[3:29:20] adam3comp: name dropping Amirdrassil better be in there
[3:29:20] Sharktribe: I hate Karokta and Swiftbreeze or whatever that rare flying fox mount dropping guy
[3:29:24] HSAyril: That doesn't sound very shilly of you
[3:30:02] XxJagershotxX: NIHIl!
[3:30:09] ApolloRache: @XxJagershotxX Idk, but maybe thats the case bc froms dlc are never after the ending of the base game
[3:30:42] Demmou: Demmou subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:31:05] adam3comp: like how Amirdrassil's name got revealed by Alexstrasza just dropping it in a conversation casually lol
[3:31:32] doomer_dan_: Tali, your video on Daneuser was great. more people in the community should understand you can criticize his work in a rational way and without personal attacks
[3:31:37] ApolloRache: Still it would be cool to enter the dlc with the rani ending or the yellow flame ending changing stuff
[3:31:56] cosmopanda13: I wish there was an option to see the threat range of mobs sometimes
[3:32:06] Nulgar: wasn't that namedrop a good thing?
[3:32:19] XxJagershotxX: I just get the idea because of showing dead miquella at the start of the trailer, then melena say “touch the withered arm” at the end
[3:32:20] onathehunter: #groupfollower
[3:32:24] keyboardturner: I love the spelling of "Daneuser" like we're talking about some Danish online internet person tneKragwa
[3:32:58] cosmopanda13: remind them to soak :P
[3:33:05] caradosailanthus: Remeber the small soak =)
[3:33:41] Daetroxe: As a pres evoker it's fine, you just fly right out. :P
[3:33:44] wanik90: Take the snare remove on fade for this week for sure
[3:34:51] XxJagershotxX: seriously, I swear maybe I just don’t react quick enough but the attack this guy does on the tank where he does extra damage on you just seems impossible to move out the way for
[3:34:55] onathehunter: you’ve got more time then you think with the snare too
[3:35:12] onathehunter: this room is the worst
[3:35:31] Daetroxe: Remember to go right!
[3:35:33] Alkey29: lore question:   were those big trees throughout azeroth former world trees ?  like hyjal,  that tree in valsharah?
[3:35:52] MrAxeffect: stay in meele
[3:36:03] Daetroxe: But stay closer to boss.
[3:36:08] TinySp00k: There is no alternative to right
[3:36:12] Daetroxe: @MrAxeffect Yes.
[3:36:14] wanik90: You go into the fast past right as they go past
[3:36:21] KatieRet_: it's anticlockwise
[3:36:21] Saumur: @Alkey29 I believe so, yes. Every tree with "drassil" in the name was or is a world tree
[3:36:21] wanik90: you stay behind the flow
[3:36:29] Daetroxe: :D
[3:36:36] nasasam: you get through the light faster to be in the dark where to balls are moving slower
[3:36:36] onathehunter: closer is better too
[3:36:39] TinySp00k: Has Chat ever let you down @TaliesinAndEvitel?
[3:36:43] nasasam: thats how i manage it anyways
[3:36:46] caradosailanthus: It helps to be in close as you run anticlockwise only duringthe ball phase
[3:37:11] Daetroxe: That boss is hard for me and I can move and heal. :P
[3:37:18] onathehunter: trust expert ball handlers :)
[3:38:16] Daetroxe: We play with balls all day, trust us...
[3:38:33] Daetroxe: ;)
[3:38:58] Daetroxe: What was that?
[3:38:58] ApolloRache: lmao what
[3:39:03] Alkey29: deb
[3:39:17] cosmopanda13: it's okay there are always deaths in this part
[3:39:18] Garysteel1984: bolstering go brrrr
[3:39:42] onathehunter: indeed
[3:40:19] lynscribe: hello @TaliesinAndEvitel i am here cause of the #VeyrHandsomeMan and yes yes, you are, ty
[3:40:54] Daetroxe: My man!
[3:41:03] onathehunter: lol
[3:41:07] jimbowheat: Tali moving to the right? Shocking.
[3:42:01] Daetroxe: Wants you go right you never go back. :P
[3:42:13] onathehunter: expert ball handling
[3:42:45] Daetroxe: Not a problem.
[3:43:09] lynscribe: youve got this
[3:43:17] lynscribe: LOL
[3:43:23] Alkey29: during stressful keys or raiding, my fingers get sweaty.
[3:43:32] thunduz: Leroy?!
[3:44:04] lynscribe: Youre sending the Dragonflight back to Shadowlands :o
[3:44:16] MrScotticus: it's dragon fight
[3:44:58] rowanoaken: Did you just get used to it or do you have a coping strategy>
[3:45:01] lynscribe: dragon fight or flight LOL
[3:45:06] Alkey29: haha trauma coping
[3:45:08] ApolloRache: Cromie has a cute voice
[3:45:14] Daetroxe: When I first started healing as a kid I was shaking like crazy, lol! XD
[3:45:19] Alkey29: the stress happened often you vbecome numb to it
[3:45:21] Alkey29: missy69Teehee
[3:45:36] lynscribe: chromie is the best, people dont like her!/
[3:45:39] lynscribe: ?*
[3:45:39] Daetroxe: I like her, she is cute.
[3:45:52] RichardNB: do you watch MDI? :)
[3:45:54] Amaranthine_Brae: I think the story is perfectly okay with some high points.
[3:45:59] fugginhiding: it's at least told in a way that you can feel there's effort. The side quests in the xpac have been incredible
[3:46:00] rowanoaken: Oh her voice is wonderful and her actor is superb
[3:46:01] chryseis: I loved her folk tale story
[3:46:07] eternitycrystal: I don't know must be
[3:46:15] JordanWoollen: I think there's just a group of people who hate the fun parts of WoW.
[3:46:22] caradosailanthus: She can be a little infantilized
[3:46:26] DragnosiOfNede: Holy Long Ass Stream Batman Party500
[3:46:26] MxViolet: I have seen that on twitter I
[3:46:28] eternitycrystal: chromiechan is very cute
[3:46:28] ka_gu_ra: @TaliesinAndEvitel is there a link to this playlist or maybe the name of the artist?
[3:46:30] dastago: because wow is always extremely serious
[3:46:35] Sharktribe: I hate Chromie purely because she is a gnome, no more than that. #deletegnomes
[3:46:38] databob1: Maybe if they hadn't changed that egg quest crow me didn't come off. Kinda bad in that
[3:46:48] rowanoaken: She's such a badass and the bit where she says Morchie is "a little heavy on the eyeliner" gets me every time lmao
[3:46:51] seanstrachan: I think it's more so a thing that blizz just do with gnomes in general, they make them sound like children and its annoying af
[3:46:57] MxViolet: but I think that has more to do with how they view her as a gnome with a feminine voice tbh
[3:46:59] caradosailanthus: Not all the time, but justa few places
[3:47:12] Amaranthine_Brae: I...get a little annoyed by Chromie >< 'Cutesy' characters always rub me the wrong way but I think that's a result of being a woman on the internet for 20 years now
[3:47:16] RosieSeren: I guess when a woman character is not 'sexified' some guys don't like them
[3:47:31] Arlaeya: I've loved Chromie ever since I ran into her the first time in Western Plaguelands. I loved the scenes with Nozzy
[3:47:32] rowanoaken: Yeah the one where Nozdormu says he's proud of her made me cry :')
[3:47:32] databob1: It was good that they changed the ag. Quest. Not , i'm not saying it was bad
[3:47:35] Amaranthine_Brae: I like her as a CHARACTER concept. I just get annoyed by the cutesy lines she gets.
[3:47:36] dastago: i can't help but think people are also just transphobic
[3:47:39] Synth_San: imagine a a gnome, who is a woman, that has a feminine voice LUL people hate weird things
[3:47:43] Sharktribe: Nozdormu is bland. He needs Chromie
[3:47:56] MxViolet: That lol
[3:48:01] Daetroxe: She is!?
[3:48:02] eternitycrystal: what really?
[3:48:02] MxViolet: TransgenderPride

[3:48:07] lynscribe: chromie is trans? Im trans and didnt even know that, I love her  more now LOL
[3:48:10] XxJagershotxX: Tali, speaking of gnomes, I’d love to get your opinion on gnomes still not having a home, after night elves and gilneans do again, does blizzard hate gnomes?
[3:48:21] seanstrachan: It's the kiddy voice that grinds people's gears imo
[3:48:31] DragnosiOfNede: huh?  Chromie is Trans??  how have I missed that?!?!?
[3:48:34] onathehunter: sometimes Chromie is a little whiny but it’s not the worst.
[3:48:36] Amaranthine_Brae: No, I -love- her as trans representation, and I love her fierceness and I love her dedication. But the way she's portrayed sometimes is just too cutesy for me.
[3:48:42] Daetroxe: Chromie is trans?
[3:48:44] Kiria16939: wow, that's a lot of gift subs at once
[3:48:47] Kiria16939: awesome
[3:48:59] ApolloRache: @Daetroxe I think they revealed in a book?
[3:49:01] ApolloRache: Never in game
[3:49:16] Amaranthine_Brae: It's discussed in game, just subtle.
[3:49:17] ka_gu_ra: in book, yes
[3:49:22] Arlaeya: Can't link but look up Visage Day. it's the short story.
[3:49:25] Arlaeya: it's online
[3:49:35] Amaranthine_Brae: like it's SPELLED OUT in the story, but like her dialogue you can even ask her about it
[3:49:46] Daetroxe: @ApolloRache Oh, I mean she is a dragon, she can pick what form she wants. Is that really trans?
[3:50:01] Disjoint_Dwarf: The burden of his Calling and knowing who he will become makes Noz a serious character and he needs Chomie as his optimistic bright lil buddy
[3:50:05] ka_gu_ra: @TaliesinAndEvitel is there a link to this playlist or maybe the name of the artist?
[3:50:18] eternitycrystal: where did they say that chromie is trans?
[3:50:28] runehako: people prob mad cause it makes them realize theyre into gnomes evern though theyre die hard hordies
[3:50:32] Amaranthine_Brae: She was 'born male'.
[3:50:32] Daetroxe: @eternitycrystal A book I guess.
[3:50:38] Alkey29: what level key you doing?
[3:50:48] seanstrachan: Folk a fairytales book
[3:50:52] keyboardturner: it was something speculated since conception
[3:50:56] The_Xperion: @Alkey29 look at the screen lol
[3:50:57] XxJagershotxX: Tali, speaking of gnomes, I’d love to get your opinion on gnomes still not having a home, after night elves and gilneans do again, does blizzard hate gnomes?
[3:50:57] butlerlog: its in her short story before dragonflight
[3:50:58] keyboardturner: and confirmed in fairytales
[3:51:09] siggyfisk: What do you mean? Real human transpeople are dragons SabaPing
[3:51:18] Amaranthine_Brae: Her 'name' in the male variant in the saving her in the past instance
[3:51:19] butlerlog: the short story is called Visage Day
[3:51:22] lynscribe: @siggyfisk can confirm i breathe fire
[3:51:22] Alkey29: @The_Xperion oh i see it now..i was fixated on the top right of the map
[3:51:23] The_Xperion: @Amaranthine_Brae honestly i don't care about having that information if it's not relevant for the history progression
[3:51:24] thunduz: Cheer100 Tali typing it here to not distract from the mythic. Let evi know ff14 is bringing back the ff15 event so she can get the batman car
[3:51:25] Daetroxe: Ha.
[3:51:43] ApolloRache: @lynscribe You can do dragon flying to?
[3:51:43] siggyfisk: @lynscribe exactly!! They are FIERCE
[3:51:44] ApolloRache: Nice
[3:51:52] seanstrachan: One thing about chromie that bugs me is her voice doesn't really change when she is in dragon form, everyone else gets a little bit deeper but she still sounds like a child
[3:51:55] JarJar_Brinkz: @thunduz Its Regalia, show some respect to my boys SwiftRage
[3:51:59] Amaranthine_Brae: I mean, you can not care? But she cares that she has the freedom now.
[3:52:05] keyboardturner: OSFrog
[3:52:06] lynscribe: @ApolloRache of course!
[3:52:09] keyboardturner: i never got that car
[3:52:16] thunduz: @JarJar_Brinkz batman wore it first
[3:52:22] Amaranthine_Brae: Like you don't have to care about the history of a character. That's your right. But that's  Chromie's background.
[3:52:29] JarJar_Brinkz: Noctis wore it better UnSane
[3:52:35] Daetroxe: Should she?
[3:52:51] eternitycrystal: I mean if my visage is a bug am I a bug person?
[3:53:27] Alkey29: michelle visage
[3:53:46] ApolloRache: @lynscribe Remember to use the dragonflying addon to be the best at that
[3:54:03] seanstrachan: @eternitycrystal I mean, she was born male and she is referred to as "she" in both forms, but we're talking about a magical being
[3:54:06] ka_gu_ra: @Alkey29 Nozdormu Drag Race
[3:54:06] eternitycrystal: well whatever it is I still love my chromiebaby
[3:54:12] Daetroxe: I try not to.
[3:54:13] Alkey29: missy69Teehee
[3:54:47] butlerlog: her visage isnt the only expression of her femininity, she is also referred to as female when in dragonform.
[3:55:17] rowanoaken: So soothing
[3:55:19] ka_gu_ra: @TaliesinAndEvitel is there a link to this playlist or maybe the name of the artist?

[3:55:50] Daetroxe: Heal her.
[3:56:01] Amaranthine_Brae: She doesn't consider her dragon name to be a 'dead name' or anything. She refers to it and HAS STATED She doesn't mind people calling her it. But a male dragon has chosen to be considered female ::shrugs::

[3:56:40] Amaranthine_Brae: It's significant because at first the writing team went "Oh, uh... despite naming conventions, it's not a male name!", and they chose to embrace it later as part of her.
