[2:03:07] thegreatdestroyer27607: yeah nothing beats being in a crowd of like 100000 people all vibing out to same song

[2:06:07] Wmage: Jdot are you using the tettles build ?
[2:07:16] BoredBadgerZA: when is global finals chat?
[2:07:32] hambdo: what addon/wa changes the icon on tank being under him
[2:07:34] tvilk: @sw0ngs almost worth it.. so many of my keys have germans, french, russian, italian and portugese who just refuse to learn english. It's not all of them, but a lot of them so it's impossible to coordinate anything
[2:09:03] Wmage: NA m+ is quite dead. Really hard to get into a top end group
[2:09:56] tvilk: I think he means the Raid Mark being under the tank, which is a result of the nameplates being under the model
[2:10:19] jdotb: !base
[2:10:19] StreamElements: /script SetCVar( "nameplateOtherAtBase", 2 )

[2:12:29] sw0ngs: Is the buyer paying for all this afking lol
[2:12:32] tvilk: That's what I was experiencing too, and sometimes the nameplate would be in the way of some sanguine or something
[2:13:03] tvilk: i just need to play more with it to get used to it

[2:24:43] twitchcaneatmycheeks: ah okay ty
[2:25:18] trentRofl: Surely if ur buying a boost you'd want it to be covert and not streamed etc lol

[2:27:59] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[2:29:28] devilhawk83: One thing I learned is that IO doesn’t matter as I grouped with many people who were horrible with their class despite having a high IO while I grouped with others that may not have high IO but were excellent players
[2:30:29] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[2:32:26] waelrick: @devilhawk83 im gearing an alt and the amount of ppl that are boosted in low keys is wild. then they get to 20+ keys and have no idea what theyre doing
[2:32:30] reippailija: before you finish typing angry chatter
