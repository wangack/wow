[2:21:28] jallaballan: best facepalm
[2:21:28] grimswell: How big is the room?
[2:21:29] Timiurgo: what's the air pressure inside?
[2:21:37] p00pl0le: we also need the cubic meters of the building
[2:21:42] karenbearpig: @grimswell unless it's seal team six operation, these guys are thorough
[2:21:46] grimswell: The water pressure depens on the volume of the room
[2:21:50] khrys_: @PsheroTV water pressure is dependend on the x-z square area so we would have to know the diameters of the pipe aswell
[2:21:50] Timiurgo: oh no roof at all
[2:21:50] Mpowerd: What happens if you take the pipe higher?
[2:21:51] SalvadorNidalee: so area of flat is no factor?
[2:21:51] MigSlayer: cameraman would drown
[2:21:52] oldirtybrucie: there is no spoon
[2:21:57] floobyttv: are you in swimming gear?

[2:22:02] DarkKaizer6: is ther a shark?
[2:22:06] Koshintu: if its perfectly sealed no air could escape so the water couldnt replace the air PepeLaugh
[2:22:09] recko1211: what brough up this topic? lol
[2:22:11] Wilya: It will be under pressure. Pressure pushin' down on me Pressin' down on you, no man ask for.
[2:22:15] markaimfire_: And this is why I love this chat
[2:22:18] HowDoIBison: it would just come down to flow rate vs volume of the area submerged
[2:22:21] Timiurgo: pressure depends only on the heifght
[2:22:39] floobyttv: did you eat before you got in the water that day?
[2:22:44] K4INN_: Call super Mario
[2:22:48] khrys_: @Timiurgo and surface area of the object
[2:22:55] HowDoIBison: booster pumps
[2:22:56] Timiurgo: @Wilya it also brings buildings down, so the building will break at some point monkaHmm
[2:22:57] Goatcheezey: booster pumps
[2:23:00] l1festalker: you use multiple pumps
[2:23:01] p00pl0le: water tower on top

[2:23:04] HowDoIBison: yes

[2:23:13] DarkKaizer6: you put the pump up high?
[2:23:14] MigSlayer: someone is sucking it on the roof
[2:23:15] bentlife: you know you can chatgpt the shit out of those estimations
[2:23:17] Goatcheezey: or a water tower on top is some places
[2:23:23] varkshot: off topic but not really The world's largest water tank is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, located on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. It has a capacity of 74 billion cubic meters of water.
[2:23:25] p00pl0le: water supply on top also means free preasure
[2:23:28] markaimfire_: It's a lot that goes into it. But yes. The building has pumps to maintain that water pressure
[2:23:31] varkshot: they fill it somehow
[2:23:32] r3muz: water deck
[2:23:41] markaimfire_: I used to do inspections on them while in the FD
[2:23:43] Sasza_Cwierclitrow: omg @PsheroTV  read Pascal's principle and that's it :)
[2:23:44] transienttuna: Fun fact: Having a water tank at the top adds stability in severe wind/storms
[2:23:46] gralful: gralful subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Kappa
[2:24:04] DaRealChriZz91: Is multilate the best Option for pvp
[2:24:20] Timiurgo: they are not a thing in Italy as well
[2:24:30] Goatcheezey: @PsheroTV or a supply pump with a high enough pressure and then a pressure regulator to knock it down to desired pressure
[2:24:32] p00pl0le: with modern utilities pressure can be supplied futher up, do yall have water towers?
[2:24:36] Silkjet001: theres floors of th building dedicated to only holding water called water ways
[2:24:38] HowDoIBison: some states in the us like mine have boiler rooms in the basements for the cold times
[2:24:40] markaimfire_: Honest question. Do you have fire hydrants? @psherotv
[2:24:44] Sasza_Cwierclitrow: almost all on Malta has water tanks on roofa
[2:24:58] gralful: cheapest way is have a water tank on the roof with gravity system
[2:25:03] floobyttv: there not code lmfao
[2:25:11] markaimfire_: In the US the base pressure for fire hydrants is dictated by how close they are to a water tower
[2:25:22] provonxD: In our neighborhood we have those stations between the buildings, they further pump the water to the flats
[2:25:26] zerohot89: In BG we use a water towers outside the Towns, or Dams which are higher than the most cityes!
[2:25:39] markaimfire_: Labeled with color for the psi at the hydrant. I'm curious how it works there
[2:26:14] HowDoIBison: we have those in the use some buildings have fire hose hookups if hydrants arent close
[2:26:20] HowDoIBison: us*
[2:26:22] Silkjet001: why not just make more water lol. take some hydrogen and oxygen and blender
[2:26:24] p00pl0le: i actually use hydrants alot at work, ive hooked up to an old hydrant and turned it off to fast and it actually blew the water main
[2:26:48] markaimfire_: @zerohot89 that makes sense
[2:27:12] varkshot: It's a me Mario I am a plumber direct your questions to me a
[2:27:12] StreamElements: Check your posture, you lovely person heroW
[2:27:13] zerohot89: and we use the gravity instead booster pumps
[2:27:14] Goatcheezey: Pretty much any valve you close, ie steam or water you should do slowly.. easier on equipment
[2:27:14] markaimfire_: Gradually, yes
[2:27:18] madvillayo: hey gl
[2:27:20] p00pl0le: old systems cant handle the back pressure
[2:27:23] unmatched45: what did you want to be/work as when you were in your early 20s?
[2:27:26] HowDoIBison: shutting off water flowing at that rate that fast is like a mini car crash

[2:30:41] p00pl0le: @Goatcheezey check valves keep the pressure from bleading off
[2:31:21] Goatcheezey: @p00pl0le "A check valve, non-return valve, reflux valve, retention valve, foot valve, or one-way valve is a valve that normally allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it in only one direction."
