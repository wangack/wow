The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

[2:10:29] EarnestSincereSugmaMale: ABOBA Fun fact: While we still call them "encabulators" today, modern encabulation machines actually operate through a series of hypermodal undulative quantum matricies, technically making them aptoregressive chirality de-unencabulators. Most people will never notice the difference, of course, as any locambulatory feedback is re-routed through the primary polycyclic encaptolography shaft, effectively eliminating nearly all percieved relative phase eddies. Truly ingenious.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation.

[3:00:09] enforceroneee: NOTED The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.
