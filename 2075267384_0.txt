[4:20:47] sweaty_irl: groups look prettier with 4 each
[4:20:55] Midew: they have to let their friend's dogs out
[4:20:56] Motelguy: Are bindings even worth it for compared to gressil THC
[4:21:38] R_GraM_: for tank yeah so dps gets gressil
[4:21:42] NostalgicDream: the aoe threat is nuts i imagine
[4:21:46] bacconader: Maybe he just wants because otherwise is name is kinda pointless
[4:21:56] loathe_exe: I think it's just bis for snap threat
[4:22:01] loathe_exe: because of the proc
[4:22:04] Ranzorx: tanks get more use out of high weapon skill tho right
[4:22:11] Ranzorx: like over 305 I mean
[4:22:12] Motelguy: OR ironforge flex weapon monkaHmm
[4:22:31] loathe_exe: !apes
[4:22:42] belemrys: my attempt in classic with dagger skill I noticed it didn't reduce parry
[4:22:54] belemrys: then gave up on the paper helmet
[4:22:56] loathe_exe: apes
[4:22:56] Nightbot: Wep skill above 305 is good, the theory that you get little benefit beyond 305 was created by the guild APES, under aliases, before classic was released in a warrior discord known as Fight Club. APES chose pvp races that don't get the extra weapon skill bonus but wanted to keep the competition within reach. They have succeeded, until now. One man was brave enough to buy edgemaster on his orc warrior and test out the damage on lvl 63 or “boss” mobs, and the data is astonishing.
[4:23:14] belemrys: aclg, paper helmet, and dagger skill weapon
[4:23:30] R_GraM_: and death sting n edgies ofc
[4:23:36] Nightbot: Dali's Classic era FAQ: https://tinyurl.com/26ywenp6
[4:23:39] belemrys: fuck edgies lol
[4:24:01] belemrys: I didn't used it on certain bosses in naxx
[4:24:01] Motelguy: pepeD
[4:24:02] maximus210793: undead trinket ;)
[4:24:29] R_GraM_: idk y u wud roll a meme race if getting into era now. by default 30-40k in the drain from edgies
[4:24:31] ferore_lks: thc MH & gressil OH is technically BiS threat on bosses by a razors edge over tf MH & thc OH, but its by a razors edge and the mitigation from the proc + AoE trash value
[4:25:11] belemrys: probably okay with iblis
[4:25:20] R_GraM_: thc bc it’s faster?
[4:25:31] belemrys: save gressil and thc for dps or rogues
[4:25:35] ferore_lks: @R_GraM_ that makes it lean towards gressil, tanks want slow OH
[4:25:45] belemrys: koopa used TF and THC I believe
[4:25:54] csd_up: tanks want shield OH DUH
[4:26:07] belemrys: tru
[4:26:09] csd_up: BRUHHING
[4:26:17] R_GraM_: hit more often, more threat?
[4:26:34] brooch_fan: koopa tested TF MH in his last raid  last year but he ran THC MH up until that point
[4:26:47] R_GraM_: for tanks
[4:26:56] ferore_lks: if you have two identical weapons as a tank, you pick the slower in the OH
[4:27:24] ferore_lks: since you want your OH to eat less flurry and get more HS with flurry
[4:27:46] R_GraM_: if u dodge with a fast oh it isn’t as bad as dodging with a slow oh
[4:27:49] loathe_exe: faster hits = more revenge uptime also
[4:27:59] R_GraM_: I’m not a tanking expert tho
[4:28:45] ferore_lks: but its basically only a consideration if you are r14 on alliance and maybe if you have TF and choose between Gressil or THC for your OH.  I know that Laty ran TF + Gressil but not sure if that was just for big dick

[4:29:13] Motelguy: Bindings prediction
[4:29:23] Zacaree55: Dali as a local tanking expert. I can confirm tanking is only viable if you wear full tier 3 with Face of Death and Thunderfury main hand while pressing that glorious shield slam for massive threat
[4:29:40] Motelguy: Bold assumtion monkaHmm
[4:29:46] csd_up: nothing more satisfying than a shieldslam crit anyway right
