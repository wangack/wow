[0:28:37] Sxnv: mad man
[0:28:42] ledpredatorx: @Reprieve17 sitting for hours shrimped up is doing much worse, effort wins

[0:30:53] christiangodwarrior97: what if your right hand is your best friend
[0:30:56] shampaine1995: Honestly both are fine just avoid porn
[0:31:09] slapshotsd: just jerk it if you want bro it does not matter at all
[0:31:19] The_Crane: What if you have sex with your hand intimately
[0:31:31] chilemangx: Id play a dwarf Shaman so fast
[0:31:32] dyriksaurusrex: yoyo
[0:31:43] Sxnv: what were you running devastate for
[0:31:44] Tyfonius: what horde race would get paladin
[0:31:48] Tyfonius: orc?
[0:31:51] chilemangx: Taurens
[0:31:54] st0neh: Flatulation? They made a rune for IBS sufferers?
[0:31:55] Sxnv: undead
[0:31:56] Witts1993: TAUREN
[0:31:56] SpacebarBarbarian: undead
[0:31:58] nwdelz: tauren duh
[0:31:58] CAD604: taurendo
[0:32:00] Unframed_: undead
[0:32:00] Tyfonius: oh of course
[0:32:00] GregWasTaken: tauren for sure
[0:32:00] slapshotsd: been wanting undead paladin for like 15 years now
[0:32:01] chilemangx: Undead could make sense too
[0:32:01] ledpredatorx: kek
[0:32:05] Jam103114: UNDEAD
[0:32:05] CharlieLad7359: flag + deva, which build you running?
[0:32:10] Buborka: Tauren paladins are so dumb to this day
[0:32:11] ledpredatorx: Unholy paladin
[0:32:20] The_Crane: Undead pally would be sick
[0:32:28] SpacebarBarbarian: dwarfs shoudlve been shaman and undead paladins in TBC
[0:32:34] eptenax: unh pally is dk
[0:32:38] Tyfonius: something about lore reasons as to why forsaken can't be paladins
[0:32:42] SkapoozZ: undead should be able to be pala.. it doesnt make sense that they cant be
[0:32:44] Jam103114: an undead paly makes more sense sense undead were once human?
[0:32:58] aBradAbroad: and TAUREN can???
[0:33:03] slapshotsd: there is literally an undead pally in classic, that rule is already not set in stone
[0:33:04] Tyfonius: im not sure, im no loremaster
[0:33:04] efracozz: undeads are death knights
[0:33:05] shampaine1995: I feel as tho undead paladin goes against what paladins stand for they are to keep back undead with light
[0:33:09] Naddah: it's silly since they can be priest
[0:33:09] Glarkroq: Tauren are Sunwalkers
[0:33:12] CAD604: is priest and paladin that much different in terms of their relationship with the light?
[0:33:18] NyndokeSama: if an undead should't be a paladin, then they shouldn't be priest either. its the same Light they use
[0:33:19] aBradAbroad: but it could be a paladin of the light that has fallen...
[0:33:19] The_Crane: All the alliance players wanna play shamans now cause they're good now lol
[0:33:21] Tyfonius: but iirc something about being a paladin would protect you from becoming forsaken in the first place
[0:33:24] st0neh: banger
[0:33:26] shampaine1995: True
[0:33:34] slapshotsd: using the light literally causes them intense pain but it's canon that they can invoke it regardless
[0:33:36] KairuruTV: the lore used to be simple about the light abandoning the forsaken; but now with shadowlands its a long complicated reason
[0:33:49] neodude24: oh shit fitness and gaming hell yea
[0:33:55] SkapoozZ: Wait. wasnt there a part where they gave up on it.. bcs they started to feel more alive and started to hurt bcs of theire body trying to heal
[0:34:08] testestkappa: sonii do you share your diet plan to subs?
[0:34:09] slapshotsd: i still think a masochist self-flagellating sect of forsaken pallies would be easy enough to crowbar into the lore
[0:34:18] Sxnv: are you running improved hamstring?
[0:34:28] GregWasTaken: so is the new youngla stuff available to buy?
[0:34:39] Tyfonius: lore is so fucked anyway im down to just fully unlock class/race restrictions
[0:34:51] slapshotsd: yeah at the end of the day blizz breaks their own rules all the time it's w/e
[0:34:56] nowheretoday: Music too low
[0:34:58] Tyfonius: gnome shamans, undead pallys
[0:35:13] slapshotsd: yes more gnome options, gimme gnome hunter too
[0:35:15] Ranzorx: if every class only got minor changes like warriors do you think people would be upset
[0:35:17] GregWasTaken: Ooo i like the new hoodies
[0:35:30] bigbcoppa: yea beach is suck
[0:35:32] Tyfonius: @slapshotsd in retail any race can be hunter
[0:35:49] slapshotsd: @Tyfonius and it's the only hunter race i've ever even considered playing until sod
[0:35:50] ledpredatorx: uber eats
[0:36:06] Tyfonius: warrior rogue hunter mage warlock and monk are on all races in retail
[0:36:07] Sxnv: facts
[0:36:13] Tyfonius: oh and priest
[0:36:16] Sxnv: u legit have to pop it at the start of a fight
[0:36:19] slapshotsd: bring back wod second wind
[0:36:25] ledpredatorx: its gucci
[0:36:25] Buborka: its fine
[0:36:28] aBradAbroad: its fine
[0:36:36] nuttifrahutti: it perfect
[0:36:37] St0nedCan00k: lol
[0:36:41] Sxnv: are you running improved hamstring for pvp?
[0:36:44] Buborka: cam off aswell
[0:36:45] Unframed_: war defensives just suck, dispersion 2 min cd 90% dmg reduce >>> shield wall 30 fcking min cd 75% reduce

[0:50:40] Ranzorx: its not just gaming its all social media
[0:50:42] slapshotsd: it's just the culture of competitive gaming, just like the fortnite discussion
[0:50:42] docfreeman1: you dont blame the players for playing optimally - you balance the game as best you can
[0:50:47] Gr3veN: <3
[0:50:50] novvum: Hey will u invite my Rogue to the guild? This is Styel...i think u remember me from a few War quest we did together
[0:51:06] Dm4n: agree, i stopped playing because it was like a job interview, to get into pug raids….
[0:51:25] brammertime: @docfreeman1 agree, just don’t feel like blizzard has ever truly done that well

[0:54:43] rutzki: cant be worse than this
[0:54:45] N_durance: bro. why?!

[0:54:52] monaad_ttv: lol ofc its fine just kidding especially for me that im bold out of choice tho
[0:54:54] slapshotsd: hey man us men need to enjoy luscious hair as long as we can cling to it before it's pathetic imo
[0:54:54] Unframed_: Say*
[0:54:58] cam00712: sonii the last airbender
[0:54:58] christiangodwarrior97: showering with a buzzcut hits different
[0:55:03] Slymmetrical: and make it even easier to seem dem cute ears? I'm down. HypeHeart
[0:55:05] brammertime: kinda reminds me of Bobby Light hair from Rob and Big
[0:55:08] mageguy8: elisCry not the cute eboy hair
[0:55:11] sinsterizme: @Slymmetrical payoS
[0:55:14] slapshotsd: we only have so much time
[0:55:37] slapshotsd: male pattern baldness comes for (pretty much) all of us eventually
[0:55:39] Hayzed0ut: sames
[0:55:51] slapshotsd: yeah but then we can do cute anime hairstyles in the gym and it's practical
[0:55:57] Unframed_: Just as sweaty as 1800 critting starfire druids?
[0:56:03] spoonyb4rd: Oh no I walked into a male pattern baldness convo and 5 hairs fell outta my dome
[0:56:11] Slymmetrical: Don't you just wanna nom on dem ears @sinsterizme? /nom
[0:56:14] sinsterizme: i wish sonii would hooj on my face
[0:56:20] Dm4n: ok, what do the girls think? they like it better now or before?
[0:56:22] xaviwoo: how's war doing in this phase?
[0:56:22] shampaine1995: Baldness is actually percentage based.  50% bye 50 and 60% bye 60 and so on
[0:56:27] archhyyyy: yo
[0:56:27] Nightbot: yo
[0:56:47] slapshotsd: @Dm4n different girls like different guys, you're changing your target demographic
[0:56:52] brammertime: that’s SCIENCE
[0:56:54] Ranzorx: nadaghast?
[0:56:56] slapshotsd: alt girlies love the pretty boy hair
[0:56:56] lequani: yo what’s good been a while
[0:57:09] shampaine1995: No that 50% of men will have noticeable by 50
[0:57:09] owfanjp: true hair transplants so common now
[0:57:11] Hayzed0ut: was it swifty?
[0:57:14] Dm4n: lol @slapshotsd
[0:57:16] Hayzed0ut: that said that?
[0:57:21] spoonyb4rd: Let's go!
[0:57:26] slapshotsd: i mean you can stave it off with drugs before a hair transplant for a long time too if you're diligent
[0:57:35] spendez: the hair transplant speech to the rising bpm of this song >>>
[0:57:36] slapshotsd: it's 2024 no reason to *have* to be bald unless you're super unlucky or don't mind
[0:57:44] ReconMazihoFanda: hair transplant will fall off in a couple of years the same way if you are not on finasteride
[0:57:45] sinsterizme: @slapshotsd NEVER do drugs like that, DHT blockers will fuck you up
[0:57:49] shampaine1995: Exactly Rosemarie oil I was told does wonders
[0:57:59] Sherzi_: FeelsOkayMan im gonna take a vacation in turkey once i start balding, surely those two things are not related
[0:58:05] Ranzorx: I think I would have to look really bad bald to want to get a hair transplant lol it looks sketch
[0:58:05] slapshotsd: @sinsterizme yes and the side effects can be managed if you care enough + dht blockers don't hit everyone the same
[0:58:11] deejydee: u like slam runes or focused rage
[0:58:23] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[0:58:26] GregWasTaken: never has since?
[0:58:26] slapshotsd: fair, same reason i got off ssris
[0:58:29] St0nedCan00k: LUL
[0:58:30] N_durance: they have meds for that also.
[0:58:31] Slymmetrical: and how is it now? O.O
[0:58:34] spoonyb4rd: Just take more pharma for that and keep compounding.
[0:58:35] Gyrospeter: huh
[0:58:36] spoonyb4rd: Pharma king.
[0:58:40] Tinit5190: At ease vesus at command
[0:58:44] shampaine1995: Rosemarie oil fellas check it out
[0:58:47] spoonyb4rd: Totally joking
[0:58:50] Gyrospeter: sonii the boney

[0:59:05] ReconMazihoFanda: @slapshotsd would you rather have bald head and manly energy or hair and depression because of dht blockers?
[0:59:06] daigurren2: 100%
[0:59:06] madthiso: payoDerp
[0:59:09] Dm4n: cannabis is better than viagra
[0:59:31] boupheurdeq: true LUL
[0:59:32] hsayus123: make a shaman instead
[0:59:32] Evirity: my first 40 was spriest and second was a warrior lmfao
[0:59:37] ReconMazihoFanda: @boupheurdeq huh SP is the strongest class rn
[0:59:42] Unframed_: Phase 3 is our phase man, copium
[0:59:45] slapshotsd: @ReconMazihoFanda it's a false dichotomy, it's not gonne be that black or white for most people
[0:59:49] boupheurdeq: @ReconMazihoFanda don't think so
[0:59:52] novvum: Would u recommend Tauren Shammies good?
[0:59:56] sinsterizme: @Dm4n probably if the issue is more psychological
[1:00:07] CharlieLad7359: yh thats it for me
[1:00:14] mitchp333: I can’t find any gnomers as a warrior.
[1:00:16] novvum: Me too
[1:00:17] azzy_dog: Shamans and priests are super fun rn
[1:00:19] Tyfonius: enhancement with the tauren hitbox gotta be good
[1:00:22] ZIPORR: yeah, i played whole vanilla, tbc and wotlk warrior.. not anymore :D enha shaman is the way now <3
[1:00:29] CharlieLad7359: dont know anything different, my first wow experience
[1:00:40] Wooshu: my main 60 on HC is a Orc Shaman and main 60 on Era is an Orc Shaman
[1:00:40] novvum: rIk
[1:00:40] spoonyb4rd: I have a soft spot for the Orcs though. Beefy green boys.
[1:00:42] Tyfonius: lava lashes from downtown
[1:00:48] CharlieLad7359: yesir
[1:00:50] ReconMazihoFanda: @slapshotsd sure but the risk is always there and you can never stop doubting if its the dht that could cause the mental and sexual instability
[1:00:54] Ranzorx: @CharlieLad7359 gigachad
[1:01:03] mageguy8: that's fucked up
[1:01:04] neodude24: feelsbadman
[1:01:05] azzy_dog: Crazy to think about
[1:01:07] Tyfonius: i got a homie into wow with sod
[1:01:18] novvum: Thought about maknig a hunter alt but i dont wanna melee
[1:01:20] slapshotsd: @ReconMazihoFanda well yeah man anytime you fuck with your hormones you gotta be super diligent and get frequent checkups, ofc it's not without risk
[1:01:20] Dm4n: nahhh i get hella horny on cannabis DAESuppy also everythink feels better and last longer. just honest opinion :)
[1:01:26] miloxz: howd ur stv go? i was tabbed because I was focusing on mine
[1:01:28] Ranzorx: sod is like a funserver compared to vanilla lol
[1:01:28] CharlieLad7359: im gunna dwell into hc a bit also
[1:01:41] Wooshu: SoD is too easy
[1:01:50] neodude24: dabbling in some hc its a nice step back
[1:02:02] shampaine1995: @dm4n that sounds more psychological then 😂
[1:02:08] neodude24: yes also nice to have a real challenge
[1:02:30] miloxz: i got 1.3k by farming around the boss
[1:02:32] slapshotsd: @Dm4n i dissociate too hard to be horny on weed, i prefer being sober if i'm doing intimate time
[1:02:32] doleod: That was the gay forum group coming for a piece of sony
[1:02:34] Dm4n: hehe maybe but whatever works, works
[1:02:35] doleod: sonii
[1:02:40] miloxz: 4 ench shamans + priest heals
[1:02:46] jellypie: we had 2200 coins yesterday at gurubashi, so nice :D

[1:03:06] KairuruTV: or just the bean brigade coming to get rammed
[1:03:09] Dm4n: its really gay to fukk girls :)
[1:03:10] st0neh: The Gay Association of Azeroth
[1:03:13] Frostlicious: This phase is much more fun then last phase
[1:03:21] neodude24: Group finder really did it
[1:03:30] slapshotsd: i didn't enjoy phase 1 too much just because any class i wanted to play was missing too much of its kit
[1:03:32] Ddocz: TBC was INSANE. Remember everybody parked in front of the dark portal trying to log in after DCs?
[1:03:43] Saulos123: STV is the best pvp event they ever created in wow imo
[1:03:43] miloxz: just you wait till you pvp as shaman!
[1:04:12] miloxz: you decided on ele or ench?
[1:04:13] lambsaucewtf: ENH shaman is insanely fun
[1:04:22] Supersikness: WAR JOKES!
[1:04:22] slapshotsd: BRING BACK WOD SECOND WIND
[1:04:31] NawtyTyme: maybe it will give u a windfury for sod
[1:04:33] lambsaucewtf: stormstrike -> lavalash into insta cast chain lighting / healing wave POG
[1:04:35] averyjames_: hi sonii !!!
[1:04:41] Ddocz: whoever said that needs to get banned
[1:04:41] slapshotsd: keep reading the comment sonii there's more text
[1:04:44] neodude24: WoD pvp was ight
[1:04:47] NawtyTyme: o7
[1:04:55] novvum: honestly MOP had one of the best pvp exp
[1:05:04] Frostlicious: Warrior do need a buff imo for pvp this phase
[1:05:07] pew2700: Yeah if were talking PVP def bring back MoP
[1:05:17] slapshotsd: wod was awful except for leveling
[1:05:19] neodude24: Garrisons felt like a chore
[1:05:21] Ddocz: my first 2700 was right after I beat Cdew in 3s in wod. Ill never forget that
[1:05:23] novvum: WOD pve sucked
[1:05:26] slapshotsd: but i did have a lot of fun with it cause my friends were all into it
[1:05:32] St0nedCan00k: legion Pog
[1:05:33] Tyfonius: all i remember from wod is my game crashing every time i tried to leave my garrison
[1:05:37] Unframed_: They just have to help war out next phase, cant ignore the class all sod long
[1:05:50] Unframed_: Colossus smash whatevee
[1:05:53] slapshotsd: warriors will inevitably be busted in sod eventually, guaranteed
[1:05:54] Unframed_: Something
[1:06:02] slapshotsd: they scale too well, their kits are too good with gear
[1:06:06] xwalonosx: Warrior is busted now?
[1:06:06] dirbagdan: its the lack of a toolbox
[1:06:08] deejydee: spell reflect needed lol
[1:06:24] Slaughter13x: What are your thoughts on fire warlock? @SONII
[1:06:25] Unframed_: In pve theyre fine ye
[1:06:26] Sxnv: i got dumped by my ex during wod so shit expansion imo
[1:06:40] Wooshu: Rogue and Warrior both scale really well with gear and weapons
[1:06:46] Slaughter13x: Yeah destro
[1:06:46] Tyfonius: a big misconception from a lot of people about warrior is that they think warriors are saying they need buffs, when they actually just want to have more fun
[1:06:50] slapshotsd: yeah i will agree warriors are feeling pretty weak in pvp but pvp in general this phase is *fucked* because everyone has so much damage
[1:06:57] ReconMazihoFanda: @Ddocz i guess as melee cleave?
[1:07:10] slapshotsd: yeah more fun warrior abilities would be great, i want banner of recklessness back
[1:07:15] Unframed_: All we need is an even playfield for pvp
[1:07:15] theonlypadrejoe: was p1 with cbr more fun?
[1:07:15] lmInno: I feel like orc holds alot of value on SoD, w the amount of new abilities to proc the 15% stuns
[1:07:30] Winttyrr: the day of alts is upon us
[1:07:31] Tyfonius: nerfing the crazy caster burst would already help
[1:07:36] slapshotsd: sod pvp will never be balanced honestly
[1:07:36] miloxz: i feel like you wouldn't enjoy ench as much as warrior gameplay, shammy has pretty bad mobility and it seems like you like to charge a lot
[1:07:51] Supersikness: Would rather be juiced P4
[1:07:55] DrLegend305: P6 is our phase
[1:07:55] Frostlicious: I highly recommend if you go enh shaman to go Orc
[1:07:56] hsayus123: they were bitching in phase 1 already
[1:07:56] miloxz: and not stay in 1 spot
[1:07:58] lezntv: yea def i rather be giga at level 60 than at 50 lol
[1:08:02] slapshotsd: pvp balance isn't a part of their design philosophy and they're up front about it
[1:08:03] PandouZ: warriors gonna pop off in end-game content anyway like always LUL
[1:08:11] Frostlicious: Shaman enhance is insanely fun this phase
[1:08:14] azzy_dog: like ranged attacks
[1:08:26] Unframed_: Would be funny if warrior pops off next phase, all the op classes will be crying then
[1:08:43] Unframed_: Yep
[1:08:47] St0nedCan00k: yup
[1:08:48] shampaine1995: Enh shaman is prob the only true hybrid dps class
[1:08:48] xwalonosx: where are my feral stonks q.q
[1:08:53] slapshotsd: people hate to see warriors, hunters, and mages be strong
[1:08:56] neodude24: Never been middle ground for warrior either too good or the worst
[1:08:56] ReconMazihoFanda: @slapshotsd then what are they balancing? every dungeon is a faceroll, almost soloable by any class, and there is only one single raid every 3 days
[1:08:59] Unframed_: They forget we dont crit for 1800
[1:09:00] lezntv: i think people just hate on warrior because of how strong it was in regular vanilla
[1:09:02] GregWasTaken: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[1:09:20] belleteteftw: but do you deserve good shit
[1:09:27] dirbagdan: I think it's because warriors were such a dominant presence in vanilla. Our raids had like 20 warriors KEKW
[1:09:33] slapshotsd: @ReconMazihoFanda balancing around fun, i agree game is faceroll but it's way more fun when you're with people who aren't min/maxing in that spirit of just having a good itme
[1:09:41] Wooshu: I took a screenshot with my phone of the Blizzard SoD forum, literally 4 posts all in a row were calling to nerf, Mage, Rogue, Priest and Shaman lol
[1:09:50] mitchp333: it’s funny how warriors are still very low on all logs and people still say they are fine.
[1:09:50] Winttyrr: i legit dont get the warrior hate either. it's not like these people are out there getting farmed by warriors in the open world LuL
[1:09:54] lilty92: Just like at the moment
[1:09:54] Wooshu: all from different people
[1:09:58] Naddah: daily apparently
[1:10:00] Sxnv: and wf warriors aint shit without wf
[1:10:02] foror22: I rather everyone get fun stuff so more people play the game…
[1:10:16] Korvynah: yo Sonii i got something crazy to tell you bro
[1:10:17] Nightbot: yo
[1:10:20] Unframed_: I really think you hit the spot on saying that warrior is left on 2004 right now and the other classes arent @sonii  LUL
[1:10:33] Slymmetrical: Thanks for the close up of the ear. I like the earring HypeHeart
[1:10:34] PandouZ: @foror22 wooooooord :D
[1:10:35] Korvynah: youre so hott right now
[1:10:38] Volryn: <3
[1:10:39] ReconMazihoFanda: @slapshotsd yeah but ppl are still minmaxing, a pug could clear gnomer, but ppl are checking logs and gs, same for pvp, ppl r only inviting melee hunters, boomkins and spriests
[1:10:47] dirbagdan: Give me a pocket healer and i would delete people in PvP too. @SONII But I think that's also why PvP can never be balanced. It's designed around grouping and complimenting eachother. To balance a game around solo play is hard when trying to keep group play intact. My 2 cents
[1:10:50] Winttyrr: warrior doesnt do dmg in pve without WF either
[1:10:50] Unframed_: Getting seducted
[1:10:52] Sxnv: give arms inbuilt sword spec but all weapons imo
[1:10:55] Korvynah: get rizzed
[1:11:06] Korvynah: you smirked a bit
[1:11:08] Korvynah: i saw it
[1:11:09] slapshotsd: @ReconMazihoFanda i agree, why you gotta find a group of likeminded people in a guild because the pug scene is, like any iteration of wow, obnoxious and fucked
[1:11:13] azzy_dog: Send it!
[1:11:19] Frostlicious: Yea
[1:11:19] azzy_dog: Get that wood
[1:11:23] Slymmetrical: Yes! I like wood.
[1:11:23] miloxz: im doing the same, get quick exalted
[1:11:34] Hayzed0ut: Daaaaymn soni playing hard to get
[1:11:52] ReconMazihoFanda: @slapshotsd ye, unfort i had problems finding english only guild in eu
[1:11:56] Unframed_: Im on the fence to get tiger or spend all my coins on rep
[1:12:02] zephon_013: @SONII what exercices for traps? I want those traps bro.
[1:12:13] deejydee: what belt rune
[1:12:19] Korvynah: yeah what do you do for traps. i just grab dumbells and shrug
[1:12:25] slapshotsd: deadlift deadlift deadlift
[1:12:27] dirbagdan: True Ok I get ya now
[1:12:29] lezntv: Gladiator stance?
[1:12:30] slapshotsd: pick up heavy ass weight and stand with it
[1:12:40] Skarsgard0110: @zephon_013 Did you see his traps in today's Insta story? LUL
[1:12:42] dirbagdan: And that's what I was getting at with the lack of a toolbox comment.
[1:12:44] Winttyrr: @SONII how would you feel about SMF rune letting fury hit with both weapons for some abilities?
[1:12:55] Sxnv: LOL
[1:12:56] Korvynah: true yeah shirt weight
[1:13:01] Korvynah: i was thinking that
[1:13:08] Gary7887: Soniiii, hope your well bro, miss the hc days
[1:13:13] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[1:13:13] zephon_013: @Skarsgard0110 YEP that's why i asked
[1:13:14] Nood13Cup: Что там про ночь было?
[1:13:26] dirbagdan: YEP
[1:13:28] slapshotsd: if you're really trying to max out trap growth do some big ass rack pulls, super easy muscle to grow if you just work out like a goon
[1:13:31] noftroit: Hey @SONII. What treadmill are you using?
[1:13:35] novvum: I think that would be cool
[1:13:37] Skarsgard0110: @zephon_013 haha

[1:14:07] lezntv: what other languages you speak? @SONII
[1:14:20] Korvynah: Chest day is best day

[1:14:25] JokiGhostCrew: Wait, ur speak russian and japanese?
[1:14:26] riotorriot111: BOOBA ?
[1:14:26] Winttyrr: @SONII yeah blood thirst and blood craze could have used some crazy buffs and still wouldnt have made warrior op. but if they had sustain, they could hold their own
[1:14:27] NawtyTyme: lol
[1:14:27] novvum: what?

[1:17:33] slapshotsd: sonii is literally an example of how you can look if you work your ass off natty (and are born with a slutty little man waist)
[1:17:42] Korvynah: I challenge every person here to do 100 push ups a day
[1:17:43] Slaughter13x: That dude sounds like he needs a hug
[1:17:46] Korvynah: youd be SHOCKED after a month

[1:19:10] slapshotsd: yes some people do have crazy muscle building genetics, you do not need them for sonii's physique (again except for the small waist)

[1:19:21] Gr3veN: And Arnold says?
[1:19:32] slapshotsd: which is why people who obsess over natty or not stuff are generally losers
[1:19:42] slapshotsd: stop crab bucketing your physique potential

[1:19:51] DadRage: Sup d00d

[1:21:59] serrer41: @SONII what do you think of multivitamines?

[2:30:24] nwjames1310: You do gnomer?
[2:30:24] itsmistero: @SONII The bots have to at least spend 15$ a sub, so why not let them in for a bit then ban them, free money for blizzard

[2:31:26] KairuruTV: if Blizzard WANTED to, they could ban VPNs
[2:31:29] reefo: the real reason is they dont use real people to ban botters, they use programatic methods that don't pick up all the bots
[2:31:31] st0neh: SIENTELO
[2:31:49] badillwwjoe: true but they will use their parent account

[3:38:51] HarryJPotter94: thoughts on wake & Knut's fat camp
[3:38:55] pmanfit91: I think P3 might be the "worst" phase because everyone is just going to be drooling over P4. Hopefully it's the shortest phase, but doubtful.
[3:39:06] mangocat40: they should make it so u can do AV next phase and add some lvl 50 rewards @SONII
[3:39:14] limburgse: alot of players taking a break till p4

[3:40:11] D_RaneThaMAne: 20 man mara gonna fun
[3:40:13] beardbrogaming92: @pmanfit91 or added some 2v2/3v3/5v5 arenas and use gurubashi as the skin for it, or diremauls arena

[4:02:33] Drooled: didnt they just buff devestate?
[4:02:36] Elyial: I go full Fury
[4:02:40] Slaughter13x: @SONII Are you gonna be at the next blizzcon?
[4:02:45] Selecktt: Yeah, so what you wanna do, is go back to character selection and get back on the shaman. DW rockbiter generates most threat.
[4:02:57] ilovestarfire777: holy shit I thought that rooster icon in your inventory is the Magic Rooster Egg mount MaxLOL
[4:03:07] soapbargoeshard: @SONII my ideas to make stv great. 1. remove the boss, double the blood zone wide so that there are less congested skirmishes, 2. remove the ability to gain blood on the altar to prevent the aoe spamms
[4:03:18] Gillbawk: true
[4:03:28] Gillbawk: just got 900 coins from my bm
[4:03:30] Elyial: I'd like to believe the extra Bloodthirst in my rotation + Blood Surge makes up for the threat
[4:03:32] Gillbawk: but im shammy gross
[4:03:41] Slyz777: immunity of 15 yrds on altar
[4:03:44] dj_efx: haha the aoe spam is funny
[4:03:46] glueater_x: aura if your within alter for x time it adds a dot
[4:03:47] sand_pump: u just got more blood than me in my mage only group
[4:03:51] sand_pump: nerf warrior
[4:03:55] stoks002: or remove alters turn in at end
[4:04:03] soapbargoeshard: i ran fury dual weild while i was tanking on my warr
[4:04:12] soapbargoeshard: and then shield when necessary
[4:04:14] Sxnv: or instead of blood that you turn in for coins just give the coins outright that would make for better skirmishes imo
[4:04:14] cbaily7: make like a "safe zone" on the altar like you said would help a lot
[4:04:32] Elyial: Death Wish + Bloodrage on Pull - Zerker after 10 sec for extra Flag. Dual Wield.
[4:04:32] soapbargoeshard: oh my bad. i havnt played sod warrior
[4:04:43] DadRage: Pornly?
