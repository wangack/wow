[2:09:25] VeniVidiVici401TV: i just simmed the raid that it dorps from and check the dps on each one
[2:09:39] donol: Either you can compare sets or items

[2:13:51] lucid_wow: cache is also using 2 dps trinkets vs 1 dps trinket 1 tank trinket tho
[2:14:16] ashwing_: does anyone use anything but the bleed?
[2:14:24] lucid_wow: cache might still be higher anyway but its a little bias just bc its replacing a tank trinket with a dps trinket so its gonna be a higher gain
[2:14:38] lucid_wow: @ashwing_ idk how it is rn but ik last season rogue used wand on ST bleed on aoe
[2:14:46] Scoodles91: run sim again

[2:45:27] DiiscoViking: its 15 this week
[2:45:31] Sollice: Yeah
[2:45:33] Veldok: No he means automatically, without doing the quest
[2:45:38] donol: Second quest is 15 and then 5, they said as the season goes on it will reduce
[2:45:45] board4life65: all raids are going to be available later in the season
[2:45:47] Knife_Party: ah u mean in terms of catch up,  yeah that would be nice for alts , especially since we're at the end of the xpac
[2:45:57] TheBroCrow: I think they said all raids would be fated at some point? at that point you can probably just slap all raids and get the quest done
[2:45:57] reggiepowa: 3 weeks for a guaranteed bis item aint too bad but I think they said they will reduce it eventually
[2:46:11] rodimusprime085: rodimusprime085 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:46:43] Honeycrispie: Correct, they will all be fated within the same week.
[2:46:46] Honeycrispie: that was blueposted.

[2:46:51] xejai: Do you think beta is today?
[2:46:52] rodimusprime085: one raid at a time will be fated, then all shadow fated... nothing beyond
[2:46:53] Theliahh: FeelsWeirdMan
[2:46:53] Wcvechten: the article said they'd activate all 3 raids at once for fated eventually
[2:46:54] Kinghorn: he means all fated at the same time
[2:47:03] rodimusprime085: YUP
[2:47:08] xejai: I actually really don't like fated.
[2:47:09] BAHL_: 30 bosses lfr
[2:47:09] donol: @Towelliee They also said the number would reduce as the season went on
[2:47:10] PvtHudson093: I think he means that the rotation will be gone in a few months

[2:47:56] Sttarrkz: just dont scrap season 4 official plans XD

[2:48:27] keeindordel: WAIT PRE PATCH IS IN 2 WEEKS!?
[2:48:29] Honeycrispie: only reason to full clear is for quest early on, once ppl farm their dinars they will just target farm certain bosses.
[2:48:30] kjdocs: some guidl will, i'd bet on it

[3:12:52] GamingDad77: fury warrior hit 70k dps on the trash before...lock hit 49k on last boss fight
[3:13:00] tbmj_blaze: dispel affix on denathrius sounds a little annoying
[3:13:08] propwash80: @Towelliee I agree with you w/ some of the talents in that alpha that should be baseline, im surprised they havent added nodes like leech, avoidance, or speed around sections of the tree where it would seem fitting. do you agree?
[3:13:21] D1Chile: @Towelliee  wait the affixes  changed from last castle
[3:13:25] D1Chile: i think
[3:13:32] AlphasaurusRexx: this ret pally been going dummy

[3:13:49] skimmedmillk: @Towelliee  Have you been following the great push? :D
[3:13:57] tbmj_blaze: yeah they changed from last CN
[3:14:06] propwash80: is the top of the dps a prot or ret pally?
[3:14:23] Eggz1004: @propwash80 ret
[3:14:24] AlphasaurusRexx: @propwash80 ret...\
[3:14:25] doomkry: dispell was shit on jailer cuz there are lot of times where you have to move away durign the fights and bad dispell fucked the fight
[3:15:01] TheCliffyShow: I almost had 22k dps on that first Chaotic Essence. I love that affix.
[3:15:13] tbmj_blaze: yeah my guild raids 1 night a week for S4 and we essentially didnt kill Jailer bc we ran out of time trying to figure out how to work the dispells the best lol

[4:23:02] micronetic_one: thanks
[4:23:34] GamingDad77: @UltiCarnagee but what if your friends all quit playing wow 5 years ago? lol

[4:26:15] veeta1: account wide currency
[4:26:15] 91Niki: Look at how much they broken with the new AH stuff. Yeah sharing gold would break everything LUL
[4:26:22] edohran: They would have to increase the gold cap to over a billion
[4:26:41] imTymp: it would have to do the math to add every chars gold  then show on all chars
[4:26:42] micronetic_one: @quigonjoel I did a m+0 tour and everything I got I transformed to a tier piece in zereth mortis
[4:26:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: people with gold cap on several characters would wake up to their fortunes gone probably LUL

[4:27:01] AlphasaurusRexx: @edohran why
[4:27:02] 91Niki: @HaxzorJimDuggan Ohh yeah that too. They would have to increase gold cap
[4:27:10] Molvonos: It's not even spaghetti code at this point, it's ramen noodle code.
[4:27:10] Ambersulfr: @HaxzorJimDuggan nah, they'd figure it out. They'd probably cap it to an aggregate number of characters or something.
[4:27:17] Archiee: we would never!
[4:27:17] Padarius: and someone would def find a way to exploit it sadly
[4:27:18] Ambersulfr: or give people cap + max character number.
[4:27:22] edohran: @AlphasaurusRexx cause there are a lot of people with that much gold.

[4:27:47] jordanoii: @Templexx damn u right
[4:27:49] lordofmadness: one character, all professions, all classes, one bag storage, one everything
[4:27:53] AvrithSATX: It's the Paid Alpha in 2065 Towelliee.
[4:27:54] raldrik: I think they are working on that with the AH changes. If they expand the AH changes to just have everything region wide it removes the need to keep gold only on one server
[4:27:55] edohran: Those goblins that have been at it for years, you tell them what?  Your gold will be lost?  They would have to increase the cap.

[5:08:34] nihilistic_bat: the death skip has been around since it was current M+
[5:09:02] nihilistic_bat: its not a new thing, its the fastest way to do this place. they will never rework it
[5:09:17] reggiepowa: @weirdo_dude you don't have to do death skip, tgp teams were pulling that backstage trash
[5:09:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: They've moved mobs in other dungeons
[5:09:37] Isadora393: i congratulate you sir for your choice of music. Best choice i heard among other wow streamers and to be fair some are unbearable.
[5:09:47] nihilistic_bat: you can do that too there are other options, that one is just fast
[5:09:48] valianya: They already moved the miniboss so it isn't skipped
[5:10:28] Lulaboo: They making a dune MMO

[5:32:02] abracka_: devs were smoking something when deciding to add kara to this season
[5:32:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Needs moar nerfs
[5:32:04] imTymp: u have to have really good team and coms for lower rn
[5:32:05] Jelanipatron: Nice way to say it
[5:32:16] QuiGonJoel: That was kinda rough but not terrible
[5:32:25] Channel_85: Wow leaving after 3 wipes

[5:32:37] TheCliffyShow: Treat it as a learning experience.
[5:32:48] codefiveone: the healer wasnt up to par imo
[5:33:02] valianya: That fight isn't that confusing tho, just don't break cc
[5:33:23] imTymp: need high dps and good tank
[5:33:24] jskillz777: lower aint that bad this week
[5:33:25] P4oFear: I mean you didnt picked me so ;) <3
[5:33:31] looney199725: you dont need coms for lower kara ppl are just clueless
[5:33:35] nihilistic_bat: also dont take moroes down to 60% before killing the adds, at least until there is 1 and a half left
[5:33:37] looney199725: kara has been nerfed into the dirt
[5:34:09] imTymp: my group wiped first boss of lower 2 times then cleared the rest pretty cleanly
[5:34:17] looney199725: people just have 0 clue thats all it is
[5:34:21] looney199725: people to lazy to learn mechanics
[5:34:32] QuiGonJoel: Hey Towlie what addon do you use for your scrolling combat text?
[5:34:45] ArcaneSyntax: you basically don't touch moroes until the adds are dead lol

[5:35:59] nihilistic_bat: There is a quest in oribos
[5:36:02] QuiGonJoel: must be a font then
[5:36:13] jskillz777: they can be carried as well
[5:36:17] twinkieruler95: Is it a variety of things?
[5:36:34] Crowargus: naw slooty
[5:36:52] looney199725: junkyard is still the freest key in wow tbh haha
[5:37:02] valianya: BfA and SL kinda trained high m+ players they can outgear most mechanics and pull big and dps tunnel.  You cannot do that in Legion dungeons, they require personal responsibility and cannot be ignored and outgeared
[5:37:11] mikoflex: Lower all done ?
[5:37:16] TheCliffyShow: I'm taking that key as evidence that I need to watch some videos and research.
[5:37:22] imTymp: @nihalistic_bat Ty just looked it up, appreciate it

[5:39:33] nihilistic_bat: mass dispell > bursting
[5:40:14] darkdestroz: what is that dmgtaken aura?
[5:40:23] valianya: See this kind of crazy big pull ignoring most things is what you cannot do in Kara, but many players expected to be able to do.
[5:41:02] looney199725: @valianya its a 16 relax u can do add pulls like this in kara also
[5:41:49] dreamwalker213: no pull is too big if you dont have monkeys
