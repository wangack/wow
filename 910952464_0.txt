[0:15:54] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: ppl complaining about items not bein able to get upgraded pre 9.05...like there isnt a pandemic or smth serious happening rn which limits their ability to work os so naaaah
[0:16:33] GoKu1g: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect u know how majority of the playerbase is now, they want stuff given to them on a silver platter...
[0:17:19] Lazugo: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect the same thing happened on bfa with the corruption catch-up
[0:17:21] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @GoKu1g ye thats unfortunate... Same EXACT thing happened with corruption..i mean come on now u know its something more difficult to do
[0:18:09] Lazugo: the systems are identical function wise the have the fix they just dont want to use it
[0:18:28] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: to be fair ppl would stockpile or restore low ilvl stuff
[0:19:00] solojoe23: you think we will ever be able to dismantle your legos for maybe half mats back anytime?
[0:19:42] ProperNev: @chat @Towelliee What is the best tank for M+ currently?
[0:19:52] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @NevaliaTV VDH
[0:19:55] Lazugo: but thats the idea valor is weekly capped. 9.1 might be coming in april/may you may have 8 pieces of gear fully upgraded
[0:20:02] TheUnknowing: DH @NevaliaTV
[0:20:39] ProperNev: Do they outscale others by a far margin?
[0:21:28] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: no they just do more dmg and are able to kite better
[0:21:44] ProperNev: Dh vs pally vs war?
[0:21:50] ProperNev: 1 2 3
[0:21:54] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: anyone else having issues with raider io? my main char is straight up deleted
[0:23:11] TheUnknowing: I'd probably say DH > Pally > Warrior, only reason I put pally above warrior is utility though, pally cant really take a hit but they have a lot of cool downs and immunities
[0:24:01] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: and healing
[0:25:37] Masqerader: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect my chars io score is there, if you mean the site itself
[0:26:34] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: ye i meant the site. My char is straight up deleted and doesnt have anything anymore
[0:26:41] ProperNev: Dh vs pally vs war?
[0:26:49] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: and apprently I'm not the only one having issues
[0:27:06] Masqerader: that's odd

[0:29:54] TweakT: then I'd play agane
[0:30:11] theoriginalzinng: next thing you know they will tell you you need to get KSM on each character

[0:30:29] Solid0Liquid: It always makes me laugh when people get carried to raise their IO and then they go off on their own and get into groups that require a high IO and they wipe them cause they don't know what to do
[0:30:31] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @theoriginalzinng ye was kinda obvious. already happened in bfa
[0:31:07] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @setupcrust so many ppl getting carried by healers. as a pugging heal i trust no guy with ksm mount,cause they STAND in every AOE they can find

[0:33:18] TweakT: on the junctions
[0:33:26] Kromede: catJAM

[0:54:50] CrunkyBrewster: yupperi
[0:54:54] BigCarlM: that valor system is so bad and unuseable
[0:54:54] daltoncurryhoe: CurseLit
[0:54:54] Dagomarus: Itl probably be late march, once we reach level 40 reknown when the valor comes out
[0:55:00] griffdog125: Hello Ken. God is that you.
[0:55:06] BigCarlM: no one is giong to use valor points
[0:55:18] Masqerader: @Towelliee is it me, or does blizzard excel at announcing something good, then 5m later completely fuck it all up
[0:55:23] ZakuzaGB: wait did i miss something i thought the valor thing was good?
[0:55:24] TheUnknowing: Blizz is so out of touch it feels like
[0:55:28] CrunkyBrewster: i wont even be able to use Valor points LUL
[0:55:33] mrniceguy817: @bigcarlm Why wouldn‚Äôt you use valor?
[0:55:33] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee blizz using valor to fix gear is like putting a bandaid on a broken leg
[0:55:39] Lavwit: The only thing bad about the valor system is it doesn't have a 226 upgrade option at like +18 or something
[0:55:58] cruzeal: !valor

[0:56:02] Sayryn: Woot
[0:56:03] Dagomarus: You would have to replace your gear to get upgradable gear, thats the issue
[0:56:12] Affiiance: Its like the house is burning down and they cant get up with new fires starting CurseLit
[0:56:18] SlayerLightStorm: Orgrimmar Kreygasm
[0:56:28] CrunkyBrewster: i didnt even know that was a thing. i'll keep that in mind LUL
[0:56:30] BJofBorg: towClap
[0:56:30] Xerevil: @ZakuzaGB Nah the valor thing is good it's just the thing they added recently that you can't upgrade items you currently have,only the ones you get after the patch

[0:57:23] acklesdh: monkaS
[0:57:24] ZakuzaGB: @Christofano ahh right, i can understand why people wouldnt be happy but i would expect that to be how it works anyway makes no sense you would use your previous gear?
[0:57:29] SpaceCat80: i would share but i think one person is folllwing me lol

[0:58:14] MOLAR305: corruption
[0:58:19] CrunkyBrewster: yeah i dont know man
[0:58:19] griffdog125: so once Valor goes live you have to wait 6 more months to get all the gear you need to redrop lol thats fun.....
[0:58:33] CrunkyBrewster: that sounds shitty and i dont even do that content
[0:58:36] Dagomarus: I already have tons of gear in my bags that i need to switch between, your doing a good job avoiding it lol
[0:58:37] SlayerLightStorm: Got a Blood Elf Demon Hunter on Moon Guard at level 48, once she gets to 50, that's another toon I can use to farm the BLR. GL with everybody's runs today.
[0:58:39] metachao: I like this decision
[0:58:40] jerseyfive: technical reason Kappa
[0:58:45] ThisTHC: I mean i dont care about this we all need to run keys for valor anyway KEKW
[0:58:51] Zyvuun: My bet is that allowing pre-patch gear to get upgraded would delay the patch
[0:58:57] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee It must be a coding issue i think, but they will figure it out
[0:58:58] Masqerader: @Towelliee technical limitation = we don't want to do it LOL
[0:59:19] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: technical reason -> not enough devs, thats why iread
[0:59:30] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: i read*
[0:59:38] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: what*
[0:59:38] CrunkyBrewster: i can kind of see where they trying to go with it, with Valor. Its like it does target dudes like me who cries about how great running Heroics in Wrath was. So they're trying to get me in there.
[0:59:39] griffdog125: lol bows it a tech issue. it should be all lvl 60 gear plan and simple
[0:59:46] ThisTHC: chat is everyones raiderio fucked right now KEKW
[1:00:03] Mallaes: I don't think it's that

[1:00:26] ZakuzaGB: isnt that how its been since forever?
[1:00:37] Sincline387: do mythic pluses for normal reasons don't do it to farm gear to upgrade later
[1:00:39] ZakuzaGB: you start fresh in a new patch
[1:00:40] Thoreya: thats like every patch no
[1:00:42] Vanhoek: Arent you going to quit retail for TBC when it comes out?

[1:00:42] Mattven: to keep you playing
[1:00:45] Affiiance: To be fair, we are gonna be refarming M+ gear every new season
[1:00:49] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee you wanna bet when that blue post will get changed after 1 or 2 weeks from the release of the patch like what happened with the corruptions? :D
[1:00:54] reinhardtdog: Eww... patch won't be out till probably March?
[1:00:58] mrrazputin: Refarm Refarm Refarm... But wait theres more. You will need to refarm it in 9.1 and 9.2 and 9.3.
[1:00:59] SlayerLightStorm: @Wazim3 Venture Plan.
[1:01:09] Mallaes: Still worth doing M+ for the vault if you need the gear from it and can be lucky it's the slot you want
[1:01:10] DrogoandKhaleesi: @Towelliee what is that follower mission addon you are using?
[1:01:12] CrunkyBrewster: see what i would like them to do is just give us more drops out of Heroic. I cant get any upgrades out ther eto even think about doing Mythic

[1:15:41] Thoreya: if its actually a technical issue they need to fucking revamp the engine at some point its literally every expansion where theres so much limitations
[1:15:43] Herzenliegen: What's going on?
[1:15:45] Karbonn: It makes me not want to run anything for gear right now because it's actually pointless.
[1:15:46] propoopimus: they already gave additonal reasoning which was exactly that, to not horde items and item restore. i think it is bullshit as well but they didnt just say it was only technical
[1:16:07] Masqerader: the system is basically the same, your enchanting ur gear with an ilvl instead of corruption
[1:16:10] Lazugo: Lets try it!! everyone just refund an item right now

[1:16:50] ZakuzaGB: am i mis understanding something is it that people cant upgrade their current gear in the pre patch for the patch or the actual patch itself? @Towelliee

[1:19:51] Thoreya: they better give us some dope shit for 8.1
[1:19:54] Thoreya: 9.1
[1:20:01] spyrhdwnas: any link to read about the issue you are all talking about?
[1:20:09] ZakuzaGB: im confused about this valor thing, can someone explain are people mad becuase you cant upgrade gear in the prepatch to the patch?
[1:20:11] Bazsidiver: tbc after 9.1?
[1:20:23] EnragedSushi: The week of March 6th you can hit 40 renown. Im thinking they need something for that following week
[1:20:25] DoubleNova: 9.1 will be around second week of April?
[1:20:31] WoW_StandalonE: @Towelliee now that FF14 new exp is coming out this fall, should we expect BC release this fall also? Kappa
[1:20:36] datNovazGG: @ZakuzaGB I think people are mad that you cannot upgrade any items obtained before 9.0.5 :)
[1:20:37] waveyybabeyy: "ALL NEW 9.1.... THE HARROWS OF NAXXRAMAS"
[1:20:53] narthy_poo: @zakuzagb Correct. Because gear is so rare to begin with, having to refarm something that barely drops just to upgrade it is a kick in the dick
[1:21:01] spyrhdwnas: @datNovazGG wtf? really?
[1:21:05] EnragedSushi: 9.0.5 on March 16th ?
[1:21:09] narthy_poo: I'm not pissed personally but I understand why people are

[1:21:33] GazXIII: It's not the end of the world with the upgrade change. It's just another why and f u to the players from Blizz
[1:21:35] EnragedSushi: Yeah I'm not pissed. Go farm the gear and get the valor points you'll need to upgrade it along the way
[1:21:36] antyodaddy: You ready for New World?
[1:21:50] Riddlz: If Blizzard was smart, They would launch TBC with the first patch.
[1:21:51] Herzenliegen: It takes so long to get one piece of gear so I can see the frustration
[1:21:52] DoubleNova: I wouldn't be surprised if they Canned New World

[1:22:11] Deadelus0: Deadelus0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! <3
[1:22:21] GazXIII: I honestly expect upgrade costs to be stupid high, or a low amount of valor to drop. You might get the item before you even have enough to upgrade it
[1:22:21] JadedOnyx19: hopefully AOC will be some fresh air
[1:22:27] ZakuzaGB: @narthy_poo ok makes sense i thought people were complaining that they could keep their current gear and take it into the actual patch lol that to me makes no sense
[1:22:32] narthy_poo: @herzenliegen Yeah agreed. I'm still wearing a 171 neck with everything else from M9
[1:22:49] narthy_poo: @zakuzagb Nah its just the upgrade
[1:22:54] kokochris: nah they wont stop it now.
[1:23:13] ZakuzaGB: @narthy_poo yeah it would be like every raid having the same loot aand just upgrading it rather than having it drop first
[1:23:23] othraerir: lol what? steve said there wasn't gonna be an nda
[1:23:28] narthy_poo: @zakuzagb Sort of yeah
[1:23:33] MrGattz: @DoubleNova id be very very surprised if they can new world

[1:24:16] Masqerader: @HaxzorJimDuggan oddly around the same time ps5 are available again
[1:24:20] tanamael: lets be honest, the likelihood of an mmo being worth the time investment of playing probably wont come until the Riot mmo years from now
[1:24:42] CADZtv: riot? lol
[1:24:47] Deathu: Is there any reason to do the maw besides doing your weekly renoun thing ? @Towelliee
[1:24:48] JadedOnyx19: seems like half the MMO's in general that are being worked on are gunna release out of date. I may just have to bite the bullet and Sub to WoW for the first time ever lol
[1:24:56] MrGattz: @Tysonpk yeah riot is making an mmo
[1:24:57] TheUnknowing: I think AOC is already over hyped with nothing to show, people shouldn't hype it on word alone. lol
[1:25:08] CADZtv: riot just gnna make a streamlined wow like they always do
[1:25:17] MrGattz: but i dont think any riot mmo will rip players from wow. sure everyone will play it for a while but everyone comes back to wow eventually.
[1:25:19] raldrik: New world now says closed beta spring 2021. No way it will be a May release even
[1:25:22] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning everyone!
[1:25:32] JadedOnyx19: i just want something fresh and decent, i was hyped for TitanReach but that never hit its goal
[1:25:42] fublizz: You have no shoulders
[1:25:47] Thoreya: i tell you if riot makes their mmo competitive and actually puts effort into it ill check that shit out in a heartbeat
[1:25:51] CADZtv: riot hasnt made a single unique IP
[1:25:52] tanamael: @MrGattz i agree completely
[1:26:01] DoubleNova: How about Pantheon , that game just seems like it will always be in development

[1:26:48] Holysal: @doublenova not close to even having a alpha

[1:35:36] schizowillie: Monster Hunter World had some cool player housing
[1:35:57] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @MrGattz i would buy furniture in the bnet shop tbh . i just want my own place like they do in ff14
[1:35:58] Herzenliegen: I had to farm anima for the pet when it unlocked
[1:35:58] Markaveli007: they will increase anima gain in next update...

[1:42:12] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @I_DoctorSatan_I wat?
[1:42:19] MrGattz: ik for a fact if you talk to the 1% top raiding guilds in ffxiv they have a laundry list of issues with the game. just like wow

[1:49:13] WhiteKnight74648: @Tysonpk oh yeah i understand. When i did the post ARR quests it was brutal. I haven't tried the ARR quests since they shorten them, but i hope its better for people leaving.
[1:49:16] thebakeriscomingforu: maw and torghast I do once a week
[1:49:19] thebakeriscomingforu: if needed
[1:49:23] OnceAMoose: It;s always good to at least socket your 235 Legos if they can be.

[1:50:00] WhiteKnight74648: @Tysonpk what kept me going was FC mates (guilides) telling me how good Heavensward was. I was so glad i grinded through ARR just to experience the stories after.

[1:51:26] Herzenliegen: FF14 isn't for everyone just like wow.
[1:51:30] tanamael: i saw a guy abandoning quest after 14 going and regetting quest to farm stygia
[1:51:36] kamikazis: hope wow releases something exciting soon
[1:52:10] WhiteKnight74648: Honestly I think developers design FF 14 early game as if someone never played an mmo before. For someone who is more experience in mmos would find it boring.
[1:52:13] metavahn231: valor just may as well save this sinking ship
[1:52:22] thebakeriscomingforu: I've never been into FF. Whether it was back when ff7 came out, to FF14. But i'm glad the game is good for the fans
[1:52:23] Riddlz: The story is better in FF14
[1:52:39] Vexxsis: wow is more appealing the more easier person. 14 has a more engaging story and it starts out slow
[1:52:41] Roffasauras: the cutscenes in FF14 NotLikeThis
[1:52:43] JMoney_1331: cutscenes are crazy long too

[1:52:57] Crowzcut: wow got better story
[1:53:03] dragothicx: Final Fantasy lacks in casual daily content (I mean world quests), which WoW has, it lacks the longetivity, you play the story and then AFK until they continue the story

[1:53:37] metavahn231: xiv has the best gameplay by far, but WoW is accesible
[1:53:38] Thewunk: ALMOST THAT YEAR @Towelliee
[1:53:42] WhiteKnight74648: The music was also one of they key things that I really enjoye when i first started FF XIV.
[1:53:43] Riddlz: The nice thing about ff14 is you only need 1 toon
[1:53:57] Roffasauras: yeah, the music is 14 is amazing
[1:54:03] JMoney_1331: yeah you can switch classes on the fly
[1:54:06] Vexxsis: @haxzorjimduggan crazy thing about that, they never said it was a trial boss? so kinda hype she might be in the new raid

[1:56:25] Phae__: @thebakeriscomingforu Completely agree. Their seasonal style updates, the "life story" stuff or whatever, is rough.
[1:56:47] swampt1l: does the 213 go up to 226?

[3:45:15] sperg0verlord: do u like carson ? i cant wait for him to leave philly
[3:45:24] Maydie6066: @Towelliee nah son, Packers will take him, 1/2 the state would pay to bring him back home
[3:45:31] Sollice: I dont think you have to redo achievements. But it doesnt really matter because you can only upgrade new gear
[3:45:34] ChimmyNeutron: I'd say Packers, Steelers, Bills more likely
[3:45:35] mrpresbaby: he'd do really well as a Viking
[3:45:36] chessboxin34: rspecting irsay lol
[3:45:48] swampt1l: hes gonna go to a team where they are contenders
[3:45:58] JMoney_1331: Buffalo
[3:46:00] SavageCheez: JJ to the Packers
[3:46:09] swampt1l: imagine the trading price for Watson @Towelliee
[3:46:09] chessboxin34: holding the ball for 5-7 secs is 100% him lol
[3:46:14] NetherRegion: Dude is inaccurate, and terrible at decision making. Looking like 2017 was lighting in a bottle
[3:46:16] chessboxin34: ranked 33rd in off target throws
[3:46:16] ChimmyNeutron: As a Philly fan I can tell you it's both sides. Carson clearly regressed, but Howie Roseman is an awful GM
[3:46:22] PokerFaceMoose: if im the colts i say give me a 1st and a 3rd and ill take the contract and you get a lineman
[3:46:37] swampt1l: dear lord that looks gross

[3:47:37] CritcobainTV: towUnforch
[3:47:41] ChimmyNeutron: I just think the organization and his injuries have fractured Wentz
[3:47:42] Sollice: Houston clearly doesnt care about anything. So the thought behind not trading in the division shouldnt matter anymore. They should trade him to the colts and the colts should give them whatever they want
[3:47:43] Captain_Aegis: XD
[3:47:44] br0fest0r: unforch
[3:48:00] Malarick: towUnforch

[3:48:17] swampt1l: i dont even know why Texans even visit @Sollice
[3:48:28] ChimmyNeutron: I'd take that as a Philly fan. Let Jalen start and develop. Take the cap hit for trading Wentz and move forward with Hurts
[3:48:32] dozilla: gotta keep his ass then
[3:48:54] TheCliffyShow: Damn, that is pretty.
[3:48:55] Holysal: Watt to the Bills

[3:50:12] dozilla: @ChimmyNeutron as a fellow birds fan i'd love to make a clean break as well. I don't think Howie will let him go without a 1st though, so the drama will continue
[3:50:13] sperg0verlord: are you gonna watch the usman x woodley fight tomorrow night ? i got big bucks on usman
[3:50:20] Holysal: yeah thats what its been called for years though
[3:50:23] ChimmyNeutron: Goff is a viable guy for now. Load up on draft picks and get young and get depth.
[3:50:28] classictwo: literally happens every pet battle week
[3:50:30] NetherRegion: @ChimmyNeutron Eagles got until March 19th to deal Wentz before his roster bonus kicks in. Looks like they are waiting for a team to offer some 1st round picks
[3:50:32] Captain_Aegis: BUT DID IT WORK??

[3:54:55] NILLme: so true
[3:54:57] TheCliffyShow: Plenty of time to get KSM and Ahead of the Curve...maybe Cutting Edge.

[3:59:44] Todmeister9000: transmog boost? KEKW
[3:59:46] Bixster: maybe there are boosting on a BfA private server?
[3:59:57] xXSiebzehnXx: Do you have to unlock the runesmith guy before the legendary traits start dropping or can you do it whenever?
[4:00:02] Xehalus: the 20% off is just a dumb thing they put there is no discount
[4:00:04] balanira: i need my tol dagor 15 for the achievement
[4:00:07] slickbriick: Social media manager bout to lose their job
[4:00:09] Roffasauras: @xXSiebzehnXx unlock the runesmith first
[4:00:10] mrpresbaby: people still won't do KJ mythic
[4:00:16] NILLme: prob fake comments
[4:00:24] dragothicx: LUL
[4:00:28] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee if i went 3/10 this week, can my mythic vault chest have a mythic generals or sire piece? of it it just gear from the early bosses
[4:00:32] Renadeim: any one suggest a release Date for 9.05?
[4:00:34] Secondbreakfasttt: lul
[4:00:36] xXSiebzehnXx: Thanks Roff, gotta get that done before oranomos the world boss is gone
[4:00:39] Xehalus: love rocket this time
[4:00:43] Xehalus: luck x1000
[4:00:45] Bovined: @critcobain if you have killed it before.
[4:00:52] TheRiwen: yes
[4:01:01] gladdyy: Correct
[4:01:01] NILLme: you get gear only from the bosses you killed
[4:01:02] Bovined: only 1 time doesnt have to be in that week
[4:01:02] Jeanssi: you can get loot only from bosses you've killed
[4:01:03] balanira: yes u need to kill them once at least
[4:01:03] Secondbreakfasttt: can confirm
[4:01:09] Roffasauras: general and sire gear only appears after you kill them in the vault
[4:01:18] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i thought that too, but then i had friends who didn't kill sire in heroic and still got heroic sire loot in their vault
[4:01:20] br0fest0r: yes, but you have to kill them only once to have a chance on their loot in your vault. at least thats how it is for heroic
[4:01:27] CritcobainTV: gotcha
[4:01:29] LOLdotCOM: just kill mythic sire 4Head
[4:01:40] Xehalus: fuuuck
[4:01:45] SteveSD: they should remove anima, s h i t b l o w s
[4:01:59] Xehalus: but yu yu hakusho rules

[4:02:09] WhiteKnight74648: i finally got the maw mount and i still find myself walking everywhere just out of sheer habit
[4:02:20] VaporySky: VaporySky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! towHAMUP
[4:02:23] LOLdotCOM: the best definition of anima, it's just there
[4:02:45] MetalManGG: @Towelliee you queued to BFA dungeon, not to event
[4:02:47] frejdal: @Towelliee wrong queue I think
[4:03:06] akia03: @Baleroc1 nope just mythic if you have 10-10
[4:03:23] MOLAR305: upgrading the gear from the sanctum only tie in
[4:03:53] toobaked1987: I find a grind that is beneficial for my player and not worthless is much better. Anima is seriously lame af and the cost for shit is WAY too high
[4:03:55] idksupz: Yo that sounds so good whaaat
[4:04:01] akia03: do you like kriek bier from belgium @Towelliee
[4:04:05] SteveSD: anima should always drop off bosses, not take a loot slot
[4:04:15] Sollice: Yingling is a huge brand
[4:04:16] MetalManGG: can't get those here in Europe
[4:04:16] CritcobainTV: POGGERS
[4:04:18] MetalManGG: sad times
[4:04:22] Sollice: Its not some nobody company
[4:04:27] nomad_91: it is tied for super casuals that spend it on upgrading the world questing gear you can buy in your sanctum and gives a better ilvl than LFR gear. think it goes to 197. but yeah that's just the casuals like myself
[4:04:42] LOLdotCOM: it is kinda wack you can get just gold off a raid boss, and not even the increased anima
[4:04:45] Vigi9413: Rump will get the mount guaranteed
[4:05:04] nomad_91: but your average player doesnt need it beyond cosmetics, so yeah true
[4:05:13] idksupz: STILL ON THE LOVE ROCKET GRIND BABY LETS GOOOO
[4:05:43] StraightErro: @Towelliee had you thought of activating channel points betting on if you get the mount after so many runs? This seems the perfect time to gamble
[4:05:45] Bovined: anima OMEGALUL
[4:05:46] Poriand: im almost done
[4:05:51] deadawake_: towUnforch
[4:05:58] br0fest0r: love is in the air summed up: unforch
[4:06:00] Jesperoni: ye its good for the mount andys
[4:06:26] EmilBIH: Can i be timed out for fun again?
[4:06:27] willah54: havent touched anything anima at all
[4:06:39] akia03: the transmog bits are so expensive 1.5k to 3k anima a bit 5k for mount
[4:06:41] MOLAR305: I have upgraded gear on alts that I don't want to run m+ on at this moment
[4:06:43] Sollice: So I didnt read all of the 9.0.5 patch. Whats happening with warriors? Is necro lord becoming a viable option
[4:06:46] shimwood: Predictions take too long to process. We'd be here 12 hours waiting for the system to reset
[4:06:58] Poriand: necro going to be OP
[4:06:59] pemadsen17: gamble 5-10 characters at a time.
[4:07:01] Bovined: @diathi123 thats literally nothing
[4:07:10] Carryout: @Towelliee let me know if you need a horde tank for faster queues
[4:07:14] Bovined: @diathi123 theres quests that give 1k+ anima
[4:07:18] Roffasauras: world anima is fine, doing a +15 or mythic raid boss and only getting 35 was just feelsbad
[4:07:33] akia03: @Bovined with the 10k plus you need for sanctum bits missiontable and such it is
[4:07:55] Phae__: Just got 4 love rocket drops from the boss. Too bad they just shoot fireworks :(
[4:08:00] SteveSD: they should add more stuff to anima store instead of money store, but we know activision blizz would never do that $$
[4:08:01] Bixster: but i want everything now SMOrc
[4:08:01] SnakeDoc919: Yea I've been ignoring sanctum upgrades on my alts and just using anima to upgrade the gear to 197
[4:08:11] Sollice: What does it have now? Is it worth switching my warrior alt now in preperation?
[4:08:18] jarilrpg: i bet they increase overall anima gain in 9.1 now that denath has been defeated and lessened the "anima drought"
[4:08:19] SteveSD: it would be cool if you could work toward a lot of different mounts / transmog with anima but nooooooo
[4:08:20] Jarlan23: fuck last weeks episode was so good
[4:08:22] StraightErro: it was really good
[4:08:27] Jeanssi: across all my chars, I've used 62,5k anima on just on mounts. luckily I'm almost done with anima mounts, need like 10k more and then the almost cheap ones that come later with higher renown
[4:08:31] Jarlan23: i cant believe they did that last week in wandavision
[4:08:42] raldrik: towUnforch
[4:08:46] Phae__: Fat Thor is hilarious
[4:08:51] Jarlan23: i really want to rewatch the mcu movies with my nephew but hes never over lol
[4:08:57] vimie: Wandavision is torture. Like watching Infinity War in 20 minute chunks

[4:09:38] Sollice: I wonder if Falcon and Winter Solider will also be 30 minutes. I hope not. I think Wandavision just did 30 minutes to keep that sitcom feel
[4:09:43] Jarlan23: cmon steven rodgers has to come back for that right? at the end?
[4:09:47] Catspaw66: wandavision this week was decent ;-)

[4:10:12] Roffasauras: I mean, comic book wise both Falcon and Bucky were Cap at some point
[4:10:21] IMMproveko: cap coming back: "I dont think I will"
[4:10:22] Jarlan23: they said chris evans signed a contract. they can do time travel shit again
[4:10:30] Catspaw66: MCU Multiverse. they can bring back cap if marvel wanted too

[4:11:05] Roffasauras: Bucky fills in Cap's shoes for a while
[4:11:09] Mecabeast: evans reprising roll as human torch
[4:11:14] darkscream181: it was bucky
[4:11:29] SteveSD: falcon has no power, hes just a average joe with a wingsuit
[4:11:34] ChaoticPriest: there's already a photo of Bucky holding the shield

[4:11:37] Jarlan23: idk i dont see falcon as capt in the movies. all that dude has is wings
[4:11:38] Sollice: They are doing that What If series. Would be cool to see Chris Evans play Human Torch for that. It's animated so they can do whatever they want
[4:11:40] Jarlan23: it should be bucky
[4:11:40] TheRiwen: there is one one rigth one
[4:11:44] xXTHEJESTXx: a lot of ironman as well
[4:11:48] xluckydawgx: Doesnt Bucky become White Wolf in the comics? Thats what the after credits scene in BP was about

[4:13:21] avlucky: the question is, can you throw it like Cap?
[4:13:24] xXTHEJESTXx: thanos could lift the hammer just saying
[4:13:24] Zettabyte: Good evening towHi

[4:13:46] Zettabyte: still no mount? pepeMeltdown '
[4:13:49] CADZtv: thanos didnt
[4:13:51] Lockrocker: I want to see Mr. Sinister in the MCU X-Men movie... and a properly adapted Apocalypse
[4:13:52] turfjitsu: No
[4:13:52] Jokervenom1978: Wrong hammer
[4:13:58] Wulfgrym: nope he can't and didn'
[4:13:58] xXTHEJESTXx: hah
[4:14:01] MugginsTV: you look younger @Towelliee
[4:14:08] MugginsTV: what you been taking?
[4:14:09] Roffasauras: I want to see Carnage
[4:14:09] Jarlan23: hulk can lift the hammer just from being strong. and thanos is stronger than hulk
[4:14:11] Jarlan23: so yeah
[4:14:15] Zettabyte: @MugginsTV it's his younger brother Kappa
[4:14:16] Nightz101: tow is worthy
[4:14:18] SnakeDoc919: he held the axe Stormbreaker
[4:14:19] CodyKane: Thanos didnt lift the Hammer, he "held onto Stormbreaker" but anyone can lift stormbreaker
[4:14:24] SnakeDoc919: lol no Hulk didnt lift the hammer either
[4:14:25] Misfit_23: Hella held it and broke it
[4:14:42] AudioJaq: The way cap uses Mjolnir is just *chefs kiss* he blows all the cooldowns
[4:14:44] Jarlan23: hulk has lifted the hammer b4

[4:15:02] ChaoticPriest: Hela stopped the hammer from hitting her. idk if that counts as holding it
[4:15:05] CADZtv: yall are bunch liars
[4:15:18] CADZtv: hulk couldnt lift it
[4:15:21] Jarlan23: yes he has. hulk and thor got into a fight on the shield helicarrier and hulk threw the hammer at thor
[4:15:26] SnakeDoc919: First Avengers movie they specifically show Hulk try to lift it and he can't. He crushes the floor trying to lift it.
[4:15:38] Misfit_23: She held it one handed in front of her and crushed it
[4:15:44] xXTHEJESTXx: I think the hammer is more about your state of mind as to who is worthy
[4:15:45] CodyKane: Hela use to own Mjollnir, it was her hammer before Odin put the enchantment on it for Thor
[4:15:48] SpammT: what are you trying to get from these instances?
[4:15:50] RogueBear: thanos never lifted the hammer. he blocked an attack from cap by grabbing cap's hand instead of the hammer
[4:15:56] CADZtv: @Jarlan23 bro go rewatch he couldnt lift it from the ground hulks never been worthy
[4:16:01] Xailen: she didnt hold it, she kept it from moving and broke it. lol
[4:16:02] StraightErro: She probably used to wield it
[4:16:31] UncleBliz: Vision totally picked it up
[4:16:34] Warro726: vison picked it up
[4:16:35] cevyr1: @StraightErro She did, the ceiling mural shows her weilding it
[4:16:35] darkscream181: Until Vision actually picked it up
[4:16:39] archangel072: In the mural on the ceiling in Asgard it showed Hela wielding the hammer, right?
[4:16:50] RocketMan23: the hammer used to be hers
[4:16:51] Wulfgrym: I think she stopped it adn them destroyed it
[4:16:56] xXTHEJESTXx: she was holding it broo
[4:17:06] CADZtv: yh that scene was funny lol

[4:17:44] SnakeDoc919: Yea I assume she WAS worthy at some point, but wouldn't be anymore.
[4:17:46] xXTHEJESTXx: you don't have to be "good" to be worthy of the hammer

[4:19:34] goblinknows: F
[4:19:44] RogueBear: the biggest plot hole of Ragnarok was that Odin's spear could have opened the bifrost and helya had it the whole time despite being after heimdal for the sword
[4:19:45] Crowzcut: best joker out
[4:20:05] Iolgz: @Lostdogal or Bottom, which was also classic
[4:20:11] Riddlz: Its like Mark Hammil doing the voice of joker. I hear joker in every animation he does.
[4:20:24] MOLAR305: legion when he played archangel michael
[4:20:24] DasWhip: The Replacements was good too
[4:20:37] AudioJaq: Heath Ledger died 13 years ago. Fucking crazy
[4:20:48] SteveSD: helya wouldve been a bad ass teammate
[4:21:07] MourvinMad: Bettany was the kicker in replacements
[4:21:07] Lockrocker: Hela may not know how to fully use Odin's spear
[4:21:15] DasWhip: the Kicker!
[4:21:15] SteveSD: they shouldve been like yo hoe, you either die to ragnaros the firelord or join the team
[4:21:23] As_l_lay_dying: The movie ‚Äúpriest‚Äù
[4:21:25] Zube12: bettany was not the kicker in the replacements
[4:21:33] MOLAR305: priest was great imo
[4:21:40] Lockrocker: yes
[4:21:44] CodyKane: @MourvinMad no he was not! the kicker is played by the actor who plays Doctor Connors in Spider man

[4:22:03] AudioJaq: He was also in Legion right
[4:22:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: he was the villian in Solo
