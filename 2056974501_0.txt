[0:15:37] KaptaanOrange: I saw choco did not attacked those men
[0:15:42] RabbiFerret: sure: You load into a map/location, loot and extract

[0:16:21] Amence_: @KaptaanOrange Choco and those boys were scavs, scav on scav ciolence is not good
[0:16:24] iesou: bubbles and Steve French are the best
[0:16:25] fictionisagirl: @kaptaanorange when you are playing as "scav" you get negative rep for killing other scavs
[0:16:27] ToddDoesStuff: @KaptaanOrange it's because there are two "teams"  you spawn as. They were the same team.
[0:16:28] RabbiFerret: you can either be a 'scav' (scavenger) who have a premade loadout with limited gear.  Other scavs (bots and players) don't shoot at one another
[0:16:38] RabbiFerret: or you can be PMC where you gear up and go in
[0:16:43] RabbiFerret: and the scavs hunt you
[0:16:47] SonoranCatEnjoyer: @Kakeko10 you lose scav karma, which has various negative affects
[0:17:33] chiefn_: do you still get negative scav karma if the other scav shoots first?
[0:17:46] idleTentacles: check the crate?
[0:17:49] Amence_: @chiefn_ you gain karma for killing bad scavs
[0:18:03] chiefn_: @chiefn_ ty

[0:28:12] PandaAddict: @Kakeko10 Yes, he is a scav boss. Killing him as a scav is extremely detrimental to your scav status

[0:30:28] SonoranCatEnjoyer: I'm a two CMS man myself
[0:30:57] PandaAddict: Gotta push through "setup"
[0:30:57] krimsonpirate: Now your intelligent?
[0:31:03] gudzgudz: and to lvl3 you need a special item only found in Labs
[0:31:07] PandaAddict: Only way to afford the wi-fis
[0:31:15] PandaAddict: Technically they spawn on woods
[0:31:35] RabbiFerret: Chatters: do hideout  things actually do something or are they just the 'objectives'
[0:32:08] brb3: @RabbiFerret they give bonuses to your stats (beyond the obvious of being able to craft stuff)
[0:32:15] RabbiFerret: or are certain upgrades required to level up vendors? or does it generate materials (e.g. water/food)
[0:32:19] 3is2c: Must be nice to be so rich Kappa
[0:32:36] SonoranCatEnjoyer: @RabbiFerret allow you to craft otherwise hard or impossible to get ammo and items, provides buffs for skills and leveling
[0:32:47] RabbiFerret: @brb3 I genuinely didn't know there were stats.  Aside from maybe endurance?
[0:33:06] brb3: yea, there's a bunch of stats! they aren't super impactful, but they are there
[0:33:26] RabbiFerret: thank you @SonoranCatEnjoyer @brb3
[0:33:27] olah18: des cms work on stomach and torso too?
[0:33:29] mort252: The big kit heals more on repaired limbs and can also heal breaks.
[0:33:41] Fallen8ngel: The bigger one restores more hp per limb.
[0:33:52] mort252: @olah18 Stomach yes, thorax no
[0:34:02] wublazer_420: What time did getting on?
[0:34:12] talbozo: talbozo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[0:34:36] chopsoowie: bt is good too
[0:34:38] ojamees: upack the boxes?
[0:34:42] 3is2c: Surv heals more health. So its definitely better. @chocoTaco When the CMS restores to 24health the Surv will do ~30. Very useful to survive more damage on that limb later on!
[0:34:46] redeyeguy420: theirs a barter to get good 5.45 ammo
[0:34:48] brb3: @RabbiFerret the Intelligence Center, for example, also decreases your scav cooldown timer and increases quest money rewards. so there's benefits but also... they just kinda give you something to work toward lol
[0:35:12] ojamees: Right click mag - load preset. Save preset
[0:35:57] chopsoowie: i think that one is zerod incorrectly too. bug from last patch
[0:36:15] Classy_bear: surv gives you better max potential health
[0:36:47] 3is2c: Higher potential health after a blackout.
[0:37:24] 3is2c: When a surv will heal your stomach back to 30 max health a CMS will only do 24. Roughly.
[0:37:32] codywohl724: codywohl724 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months!

[0:39:54] cosmic_dj: Sorry choco was in ICU what happened to eco ? Did we shoot the meteor ?
[0:39:57] SonoranCatEnjoyer: @chocoTaco elite perception is 15% better hearing
[0:40:13] ojamees: at max strenght your gear that you wearing dont count as weight. So only the loot and mags count for total weight
[0:40:16] 3is2c: @RabbiFerret Strenght stat in general. And yes you can increase that via using your own gym ;P

[4:03:59] michaelroni: FF14 constantly amazes me with how good the controller UI is... like I was so skeptical that controller could work on a MMO, but FF14 smashed that notion
[4:04:04] fictionisagirl: I miss three day AV pvp :p

[4:06:18] fictionisagirl: @cecibones I'm training at work for my new job, but it's in an task I've been doing for fun my whole life so it's easy lol. I got all of em right on the practice tests :)
[4:06:18] RaymanAstraea: @michaelroni but you need like 15 button presses to do anything
[4:06:27] EvilMan626: @HngryHngryHipHoe chocotHmm
[4:06:29] yupcoltonjames: Diablo 4 almost feels better on controller outside of inventory management
[4:06:35] talbozo: Love PoE on steam deck
[4:06:42] HngryHngryHipHoe: @EvilMan626 sounding efficient...
[4:06:43] michaelroni: @RaymanAstraea I mean.... is that significantly different from playing this game?
[4:07:01] mongypaul: Heal or flash heal with Penance and prayer of mending.
[4:07:10] mongypaul: Lesser is kinda not worth it.
[4:07:10] RaymanAstraea: @michaelroni just controller vs mouse I mean in FFXIV. It's good that it works but it's a bit tedious imo

[4:09:48] RaymanAstraea: @michaelroni yeah it's great for battling just menu stuff is annoying. For example requesting a repair. But you get used to it I guess
[4:10:48] michaelroni: @RaymanAstraea I guess I see that? But like, again, having played roller in that game for so long now, I find that I zoom zoom through a lot of the menu UI. I guess I have the muscle memory for how many presses I need for each section.
[4:11:00] fictionisagirl: This is sfk right?

[4:13:42] michaelroni: @ghostex36 supposedly FF9 remake showed up on some leaked nvidia something or other a while back, so I guess we'll see

[4:14:48] ghostex36: @michaelroni I think that one is almost a definite…Kitase stated recently a remake of VI could take about 20 years…I DON’T CARE!!! Just do it, man!!!
[4:14:55] RaymanAstraea: doesn't sound like your kind of game. Single player hundreds of hour story b ased games
[4:15:07] ghostex36: @evilman626 Troo
[4:15:08] ponkberry: FFIX me papi

[4:18:39] ghostex36: @michaelroni I get the reasoning; though. 6 has so many major characters, that would be a huge undertaking. But…that world put on screen in the same way as FFVII Remake. Dude…I would really love that.
[4:18:40] kepaa17: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 I love this!
[4:19:24] s0reven: @GuacaMoley I do that for every game I play.
[4:19:41] michaelroni: @ghostex36 a full scale remake of 6 would be crazy good.... and I have to confess, I haven't played FF7 remake, and even w/ rebirth coming out soon I'm not going to play either one of those *yet*

[4:20:46] GuacaMoley: Does anyone know Pure Pwnage, "Wow is a feeling?" I met and know one of the creators for that now :D. Wow was the best.
[4:21:08] michaelroni: @ghostex36 Well like, I've heard that Remake is very good. I just don't want to play some of the story, then wait a few years, play some of it, then wait a few more years, etc.

[7:17:03] AssembledBits: @chocoTaco are you excited about the Disney / Fortnite news?
[7:17:07] HandSignals: like 2 minutes
[7:17:17] ponkberry: Yeah, it looked like dropped frames vs stutters since it was buffering
[7:17:19] ChiStephGal: better pick them back up
[7:17:30] ponkberry: maybe a span of 2-3min
[7:17:34] ninjabasset144: yeah
[7:17:36] jsh66: Yeah just a few minutes ago
[7:17:36] AssembledBits: it happened for 45 seconds while you were in the air

[7:24:04] ChiStephGal: what does hitting v do?
[7:24:13] TheCorruptOne: Health bars
[7:24:37] Twinkyisland: @TheCorruptOne no, he doesnt like how it looks
[7:24:54] BradBot: Does this game require a subscription?
[7:25:21] AssembledBits: @BradBot a subscription and your first born
[7:25:40] BradBot: Will they accept a nephew?
[7:25:56] EvilMan626: Yea I dont think its specific to your first born
[7:26:01] ScienceRobot: immersion gone
[7:26:06] BradBot: Guess I'll read the ToS
[7:26:24] EvilMan626: chocotLUL
[7:26:24] ghostex36: @bradbot I believe “first born” is written in the language of the subscription agreement.
[7:26:26] AssembledBits: It's not even the child itself, more so the promise that you just won't have the time to make one because you'll be doing dailies forever
[7:26:56] BradBot: I have no experience w/ WoW, but I sunk a lot of time into Dofus
[7:27:20] AssembledBits: EVE
[7:27:24] Balzar7: omg i have never heard of anyone else that has played dofus
[7:27:25] HandSignals: everquest
[7:27:29] BradBot: Dofus was an mmo I played that had a subscription
[7:27:32] EvilMan626: Everquest
[7:27:37] jax0falltrades: iracing
[7:27:43] BradBot: @Balzar7 it's a classic!
[7:27:43] cyclops6eight: Ultima Online had one
[7:27:58] EvilMan626: Runescape
[7:28:03] BradBot: I was running three accounts on once back then D:
[7:28:04] Balzar7: @BradBot me and my brothers loved that game back in the day
[7:28:05] AssembledBits: EVE is sub based but long time players build economy and purchase PLEX credits.. It's amazing but also, too involved
[7:28:11] lebr0nzej4mes: @cyclops6eight you could play on non official servers tho
[7:28:11] yvmato: the elder scrolls online had subs for some time
[7:28:15] ghostex36: I, honestly, didn’t enjoy WoW or Guild Wars. Maybe New World, to a degree…but I don’t have patience for games with hard grinds like these.

[7:29:47] EvilMan626: Yea that fps looked cool
[7:30:23] BradBot: I remember leveling from 190-200 felt impossible. I got my Car to 198 I think and reclaimed my life shortly after.
[7:30:23] AssembledBits: I got into EVE because back in the day when Dust 514 was hyped
[7:30:32] BradBot: Cra* :D
[7:30:48] BradBot: What race did you run?
[7:30:55] zaidogg: Winning
[7:31:12] Balzar7: my main was a rogue
[7:31:18] Balzar7: loved slinging bombs around
[7:31:27] ponkberry: SpaceZ
[7:31:47] saw141: Namalsk PogChamp
[7:31:51] saw141: Kappa
[7:31:55] BradBot: Dude, you're making me feel old. The Rogue didn't exist when I was playing
[7:31:59] ponkberry: Is Marauders the closest thing to something like that? LUL
[7:32:03] neugassh: lantia
[7:32:11] AssembledBits: EVE Online is kind of like DayZ in space, in the sense that, you can get ganked easily out of nowhere
[7:32:39] ghostex36: I wish I had a PC that could run Star Citizen…I’m kind of hyped for that Squadron 42…or whatever number, that is coming out.
[7:33:01] jsh66: That's more Tarkov in space
[7:33:09] AssembledBits: I wish Star Citizen didn't have a horrible business model and there was stuff to do
[7:33:21] Balzar7: @BradBot i switched to rogue when it came out, but i had mutiple other classes before that
[7:33:22] BradBot: I think the Pandas were the last race added before I stopped
[7:33:51] BradBot: My main was a Cra, and then I had an eni and a panda
[7:34:09] BradBot: The game was surprisingly easy to run multiple
[7:34:25] AssembledBits: Last time I checked you can buy $100 ships in Star Citizen and they can get wiped... WUT
[7:34:52] neugassh: there are 40k ships LUL
[7:35:17] AssembledBits: That's gross.. No Man's Sky is better than Star Citizen
[7:35:21] zaidogg: So excited about the 24 hours saturday Takov stream!!!!
[7:35:47] Balzar7: Iop was my main before rogue
[7:36:00] ghostex36: @assembledbits I only wish the Co-Op stuff in NMS was better developed. I am actually having a blast with that game.
[7:36:25] BradBot: Did you play any Wakfu when it came out? I'm not sure what happened to that
[7:36:52] Balzar7: nah, that wasnt my cup of tea
[7:36:55] saw141: wafku hek
[7:37:06] BradBot: Wakfu was a spin off of Dofus
[7:37:07] AssembledBits: @chocoTaco not even from dying, pretty sure season/server resets make you lose stuff.. that's what it seemed like
[7:37:48] DaPhantomPhreak: DaPhantomPhreak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! chocotEZ chocotEZ
[7:37:50] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 NMS can be really cryptic from a user experience.. it doesn't do a good job at telling you anything
[7:37:56] deucerr: chocotHonk
[7:39:01] Solitaire0: Tfw your prime sub runs out but is not available to resub 😭
[7:39:04] ghostex36: @assembledbits It really doesn’t…but once you figure stuff out, it’s an interesting concept (I assume you mean story wise and instructional).
[7:39:31] Solitaire0: Thanks Jeff bezos
[7:39:49] saw141: gratz
[7:39:51] treetop_: grats :D
[7:40:07] BradBot: @Solitaire0 why is in unavailable?
[7:40:10] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 in every aspect. It requires context building over time. It's like it's relying on the story metaphors to tell you what to do
[7:40:20] ChiStephGal: is that little guy like a turret?
[7:40:29] ghostex36: I know I had to relearn key mechanics later on that were barely mentioned…like, press T to make the mining sphere smaller and collect more from resource nodes. Wait, when did you tell me this…? @assembledbits
[7:40:38] EsohX: Bro eating his spit
[7:41:09] Solitaire0: @bradbot I think there's a gap, just have to wait a bit like Choco says. It's fine.
[7:41:10] ChiStephGal: tirepo has a minion
[7:41:16] ChiStephGal: you do too but idk what yours does
[7:41:31] ghostex36: @assembledbits This is true…but I do have a lot of fun experimenting with mass resource farm builds and Sentinel Ship hunting.
[7:42:33] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 I started playing back in December, all that month to do PS5 achievements. I ended up doing duplication glitches with the portal refiner. It becomes grindy in a whole new way

[7:49:52] tirepo: sadge
[7:50:05] ghostex36: @assembledbits Or…having enough money to buy resources off every trader. But, I can understand that. I just started making massive resource farms to build Stasis Devices on demand. These builds get nuts…but, I like testing things with those.
[7:50:16] ChiStephGal: @treetop_ have you been playing any WoW?
[7:50:46] treetop_: @chistephgal not in many years
[7:50:56] EvilMan626: KEKW
[7:51:06] treetop_: I did progression raiding for a while in BC and Wotlk
[7:51:16] Solitaire0: Solitaire0 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Papa bezos let me sub again!
[7:51:27] treetop_: a little casual raiding in cata and mists

[7:52:06] treetop_: @chistephgal how about you?
[7:52:12] EvilMan626: Dang undead
[7:52:12] doomswah: Combat in general causes durability loss over time. Getting hit more does more durability damage, from memory
[7:52:16] ChiStephGal: nah i've never played
[7:52:36] tirepo: its fun steph!
[7:52:43] doomswah: Yep
[7:52:57] ghostex36: @assembledbits They did in December…but, I’d like another crack at them, myself. Light No Fire is something I am watching. Plus…the first 2024 update for NMS looks to be pretty tasty.
[7:52:58] ChiStephGal: i'd have to have someone carry me for combat, i don't know what any of this stuff means
[7:53:16] ChiStephGal: i'm not going to make some poor sod play with me, it would be too annoying for them
[7:53:39] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 I should have done the autophage one twice, for both head-pieces. I did get the Golden ship tho. It's pretty
[7:54:05] treetop_: I really miss healing in raids, I feel like it’s a fairly unique gameplay loop, no one else has done it as well and nothing outside of MMOs really scratch that itch
[7:54:51] michaelroni: 1 copper chocotRich
[7:54:59] ghostex36: @assembledbits I started the Cartographers one, but my work schedule just killed my participation in it. I did find a Silver Vector in the wild, so…at least I got one. LUL DinoDance DinoDance

[7:55:45] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 I work for tech startups, so whenever I get laid off I binge a game out of depression
[7:56:04] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 never have any luck finding ships

[7:57:08] ninjabasset144: circle of life @chocotaco
[7:57:26] ghostex36: @assembledbits The Coordinate Exchange on Reddit…cheating, I know…has aided a couple of my expeditions. Others, I just got lucky.
[7:57:51] michaelroni: Oh, I thought Bob was tanking and tirepo was DPS-ing
[7:57:57] michaelroni: Whoops
[7:58:10] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 I am 36 years old, cheating in video games (so long as it's not PVP) is literally necessary to me
[7:58:24] AssembledBits: @ghostex36 granted, my favorite games are things like Spider-Man and Skate

[7:59:35] michaelroni: If you don't have damage charts, there's no way to know if you're rank one or not Kappa
[7:59:39] treetop_: tanks don’t do a lot of damage, healers don’t either so you need people in the DPS role to actually kill the baddies

[8:31:54] AssembledBits: WoW does need a UI update, it's been like this for 20 years
[8:32:23] AssembledBits: Mods should not be necessary, it just needs some sprucing up

[8:37:08] AssembledBits: I just looked at the new UI updates.. what I'd like to see is more clarity, less muddy colors, more shine to those borders
[8:37:11] michaelroni: KEKW
[8:37:34] Lurn: what server are u on
[8:37:41] michaelroni: !wow
[8:37:41] StreamElements: choco is playing as an undead holy priest. He's in Bob's guild on the Crusader Strike server for Classic WoW Season of Discovery.

[8:38:12] saw141: I really don't like the newer default UI for Retail WoW. You kind of have options to make things look like they did before but imo there needs to be a completely classic UI option.
[8:38:12] Lurn: they call me the gankgodx where i’m from B)
[8:38:18] AssembledBits: I think I am still on Rexxar

[8:41:08] ChiStephGal: good news you're playing with buff mommy
[8:41:30] ponkberry: Wowee combos
[8:41:39] cogglen: hey Choco, been a long time since I’ve played but if I remember correctly repeating penance isn’t very efficient, better to use heals then immediately use penance after the heal but only when really needed. also shield causes more aggro than heals so don’t use it except when someone’s gonna die
[8:42:23] AssembledBits: @cogglen that whole message was dependent on you remembering correctly, do you?
[8:42:35] tiktoktictac: reidBwop
[8:42:51] fictionisagirl: I barely played priest, I preferred druid healing and then monk later
[8:43:43] cogglen: @assembledbits haha yeah but it was in classic
[8:44:00] onyina: @chocoTaco you're missing inner fire
[8:44:15] AssembledBits: do ability choices and gear play off each other?

[8:44:35] onyina: OMG Prayer of mending is game changer @chocoTaco, what are your professions?
[8:44:42] octavia_sin: 1 raiders from octavia_sin have joined! 
[8:45:14] cogglen: yeah you’re good Choco, it’s also kind of a heals/second thing - you can put out a 300 heal then immediately penance for 170
