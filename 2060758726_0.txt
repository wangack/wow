[1:14:11] ItzBeardMan: ITS NOT A BIG PROBLEM LOL
[1:14:11] SippinSimpSyrup: Lol “we shouldnt punish people who exploited because the punishment is nt harsh enough”

[1:14:36] SoWereInCopperThen: @Xaryu wiping gear is only fair when it was a bug or something against terms of service used to get the items..... no one broke any rules

[1:15:12] williwhite94: then dont play a warlock LOL
[1:15:12] BIuffwatcher: i think you'll just land "solo" into a pack of death
[1:15:17] SaucyStreamsLive: Thats the struggle of being a lock lmao
[1:15:18] Liloxcj: idk why you guys are hating on him he just literally going over everything and saying what he sees in the forums and shit
[1:15:19] SaucyStreamsLive: wtf
[1:15:21] SippinSimpSyrup: Yeah cant wait to be killed by some druid starsurging in the air
[1:15:27] BKDDY: soon shards wont exist ICANT
[1:15:29] bigblunted420: def not the coolst thing
[1:15:30] SaucyStreamsLive: Why people upset about that one
[1:15:33] SoWereInCopperThen: @williwhite94 exactly the guy in video wants retail basically
[1:15:34] mylittlehombre: it’s a risky move because the servers are trash and can’t handle it
[1:15:37] jimmysnowshoes: Imagine dying on a Warlock LUL
[1:15:38] rizzler90: @Xaryu so wait they are claiming you are exploiting for farming people camping a graveyard?
[1:15:39] Saturos47: because you dont get honor in the vent so u cant get new shards
[1:15:41] Ervill1: can't wait to play the event and realize I killed people who don't give bloods haHaa
[1:15:41] taylorsdank: No reason tohate on this guy, he's just doing a news segmant basically
[1:15:41] Snorlax_King: couple days??? its a 20yr old game
[1:15:43] Mahca_: true
[1:15:47] williwhite94: @DaveFromTheCape EXACTLY !
[1:15:47] endz0r: I just feel like it would be way more fun if it was solo only
[1:15:57] monaad_ttv: there is no problem any more since u geta 1 min debuff
[1:16:00] 666dammit: Im just happy that i dont understand his english
[1:16:03] bigblunted420: Bro its a massive L. Give it a few weeks and watch how trash it is
[1:16:06] amazonianshroomsniffer: AV snowballs that knock back is the coolest pvp xarEZ
[1:16:06] RedChaosTV: its really bad right now, im level 32 hunter and getting 1 shot by level 40's every were
[1:16:09] highkingkevin: ya u need to not take damage
[1:16:11] AceOfFlame: already basically that
[1:16:14] Nwoll1: you get one minute immunity
[1:16:15] realandtruephobe: biggest issue is tons of 5 man groups working together and colluding
[1:16:17] Tobythen: Just like in supersmash
[1:16:18] mistahfrank: go ahead and try the event now and see how terrible the layer phasing is, and the lag
[1:16:20] Annoulol: wintergrasp
[1:16:21] monaad_ttv: there is no problem any more since u geta 1 min debuff  there is no problem any more since u geta 1 min debuff

[1:16:30] monaad_ttv: there is no problem any more since u geta 1 min debuff  there is no problem any more since u geta 1 min debuff  there is no problem any more since u geta 1 min debuff
[1:16:30] Juicexlol: Wintergrasp
[1:16:30] DiotheGod: i really didnt like the event at all
[1:16:31] Juicexlol: has it
[1:16:32] Mahca_: they should let you teleport  to other chain spirits
[1:16:33] bubbleznchaos: no
[1:16:35] bigblunted420: go play the event @Xaryu see how good it is
[1:16:37] chr47: @Xaryu the gy are all over the zone so you are constantly fighting people with the debuff right now, cannot escape it anywhere
[1:16:38] Snorlax_King: did the classic devs ever play retail?? alot of these issues already have fixes in retail
[1:16:43] Mayern: nerf shadow priest and boomies, ty :p
[1:16:45] monaad_ttv: there is no problem any more since u geta 1 min debuff
[1:16:49] bubbleznchaos: i want it to feel like WoW not fortnite lol
[1:16:49] ShinyMatrex: @Xaryu They can do it similar to the azerite BG in retail, with the battleships
[1:16:54] ReallyThough: @Snorlax_King hyeah confusing
[1:16:55] Zoismoe: it’s good rn, fixed the GY camping. nobody fights at GY everyone resses mounts up and gets w group. @xaryu
[1:16:58] JohnnyBokelo_: like battlefield
[1:17:02] Mister_Ript: Somebody timeout monaad_ttv,  dudes just spamming
[1:17:03] mistahfrank: much bigger issue is the layer phasing and the lag. I havent even played with my group cause we are on different layers
[1:17:05] Carepai: that sounds nice
[1:17:08] SaucyStreamsLive: Thats a pretty cool idea
[1:17:08] Ervill1: @monaad_ttv so those people can kill you, but you have no incentive to kill them for a whole minute. Doesn't sound fun for the better player
[1:17:13] monaad_ttv: yeah cause he never reads
[1:17:15] NoBluez: respawn point selection would be huge
[1:17:16] BIuffwatcher: adding "flying" with gliders would suck
[1:17:17] monaad_ttv: and missleading us rn
[1:17:17] Carepai: and the lag
[1:17:19] bigblunted420: The problem is layering. Its a MASSIVE L
[1:17:21] Redrulz: Redrulz subscribed with Prime. 
[1:17:21] monaad_ttv: cause he wont read
[1:17:23] Sauzes: On living flame most people have been real good on not camping
[1:17:24] realandtruephobe: We have 40 man raids broken into 5 man groups dominating
[1:17:25] darkom31: blizz could dynamically spawn people in the lower populated areas, keeping the entire zone pumping
[1:17:25] Zoismoe: it’s good rn, fixed the GY camping. nobody fights at GY everyone resses mounts up and gets w group. @xaryu
[1:17:26] SoWereInCopperThen: @Xaryu why dont they just make a main rez point for each faction guarded by level 60 guards
[1:17:26] popzirl: camping gy is 'classic experience'
[1:17:27] Mahca_: it just gets hard to find people worth blood halfway through the event
[1:17:29] lampsterof79: Lag last night was pretty horrid
[1:17:30] Mightyowner94: @Xaryu  Isn't that like you do in Wintergrasp?
[1:17:32] Phrosted_: I just did my first event at 11 est on lone wolf and it was great, got enough coins for an epic
[1:17:35] SaucyStreamsLive: @DaveFromTheCape I like this too
[1:17:37] bigblunted420: Lag Is HORRIBLE
[1:17:42] Snorlax_King: its not good xar. these are issues that have fixes in retail
[1:17:44] Maifraind: its lag fiesta, no pvp
[1:17:49] realandtruephobe: \
[1:17:53] bigblunted420: whole chat saying its bad. xaryu says W
[1:17:54] dont_ban_this_name_twitch: this is the ptr
[1:17:55] bigblunted420: LUL
[1:18:00] windatar: As soon as the blood moon starts everyone in the zone should get randomly teleported across the zone and then when you rez at a spirit healer you should be teleported to another place of the zone randomly. IMO.
[1:18:01] chobinhood_: i just think that exploit was so easy to see coming
[1:18:01] Mahca_: I got layered from my group lol
[1:18:03] Mister_Ript: @monaad_ttv He doesn't owe you anything.  And, you can still be killed whether or not its for currency or not.  Players have camped graveyards and corpses for 20 years just for the sake of killing.
[1:18:04] Wyant69: @DaveFromTheCape But the event isnt faction specific
[1:18:04] Nightfocus: People complaining about a 20year old Game , LOL
[1:18:06] iamrayzir: spriest <3
[1:18:08] hugowooop: Legit unplayable, rubber band and get 1 shot by boomie
[1:18:11] Phrosted_: sleeping bag quest chain was fun af
[1:18:14] christiangodwarrior97: its so easy if u are on a big server. u can just get summoned around the world
[1:18:14] Phrosted_: IMO
[1:18:15] Thabab040: you sound paid or at least partnered LUL
[1:18:15] Zoismoe: it’s good rn, fixed the GY camping. nobody fights at GY everyone resses mounts up and gets w group. @xaryu  lag can be bad but it’s whatever tbh
[1:18:18] monaad_ttv: then why do i owe to not spam ? lmao
[1:18:20] canonic: sleeping bag not worth
[1:18:21] xNotorietyx: @Xaryu theres a bug where you can enslave demon a warlock in metamorphaiss. its so funny
[1:18:22] SarsonThings: Hard to call it a massive W when it's currently unplayable
[1:18:27] monaad_ttv: this is missleading
[1:18:29] Mister_Ript: @monaad_ttv Clown
[1:18:29] brie_feusang: Imagine complaining the sleeping bag chain was tedious when it took less than an hour KEKW
[1:18:30] taylorsdank: reddit is way better than disc and ive never used it
[1:18:31] heyitsken_: am I only the guy who thinks this looks very similar to Diablo 4 pvp. go to designated zone, farm shards, and turn in.  xaryu
[1:18:32] bigblunted420: Seems Xaryu the only who gives this event a massive W KEKW
[1:18:32] Theshape47: lvl 40 yet?
[1:18:34] monaad_ttv: yeah
[1:18:39] chamlet2764: doesnt the seething shore in retail have a mechanic similar to the goblin glider thing where you drop from the ships circling above
[1:18:41] mistahfrank: whats the reddit link?
[1:18:41] monaad_ttv: im clown and i love it

[1:32:01] Dionxdalai: you can still win trade in different ways
[1:32:05] realandtruephobe: xar i think you are wrong about getting all your bloods in a day. Meta has completely changed

[1:32:17] rast0s: @Xaryu dont u think this event could be more fun if its really everyone for themselves? Like no groups also
[1:32:19] ryan___mcg: @feelsbadwoman forreal. ppl are so dumb lol. if it’s possible in the game it’s the game devs jobs to fix it and make it impossible

[1:32:50] sinfullfilled: all you can do is raid gnomer and pvp really
[1:32:50] bendelat: No, the real problem is Blizzzard for allowing this to be exploitable in the first place. They were thinking how to exploit these they would have found this in 30 seconds and not release it
[1:32:57] Macroxx_Rc: @randysavagelo so u now have 2 months of nothing, nice

[1:33:50] ooTHExTUBEoo: you have to go to the normal youtube video and turn that down, then go back to the short DansGame

[2:09:31] asloff: Good morning Xar

[2:09:32] bigjey801: SOD IS BEST
[2:09:32] ttmilzy: not sure why you like it you always talk about how grouping and running around with random people is what makes wow fun
[2:09:34] williambes1: what is ssf? IM stupid
[2:09:36] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: I really like watching you play HC, but i'm not excited to play it myself
[2:09:42] hoopyfrood12: you'll be done with sod p2 before ssf release

[2:09:56] NoGrave: just wait
[2:09:58] sunny_lik: bug
[2:09:59] sushileafbeats: test it for science
[2:10:01] badillwwjoe: mob tagging killed HC and streamer did that publicly
[2:10:01] jimmy_irl: this looks like some private server shit
[2:10:01] qtCrasH: the hype for hardcore on twitch died after SoD got announced at blizzcon, at least that’s how it felt for me
[2:10:04] thejiggler1: I was physically sick when I died on my 37 priest in hc
[2:10:04] SneakyyDee33: SoDcore P2?
[2:10:06] ipntheshower: Hardcore ded @Xaryu ?

[2:10:17] Witality: Why we sleepin
[2:10:19] provender_: I can't believe they added a "sleep" mechanic
[2:10:20] themadfeltcher: is self found like self suck. Seems like it'd be fun but it's not as good as with others
[2:10:22] The_RightTwix: I don't think i'd be hyped for SSF even if we were still in p1 sod
[2:10:22] NoGrave: Clap
[2:10:23] Renriak: @bigwilly3737 The scroll he used is exclusive to Mages and it cost him 1.5g.
[2:10:24] lindty: don’t waste time your death is imminent anyways
[2:10:25] sushileafbeats: ez
[2:10:27] barskebaard: @qtCrasH nah it died when SOD launched, not when it was announced
[2:10:38] heyitsken_: hardcore will be fun again once SOD is over assuming this the end of classic+
[2:10:41] Ronin825: why am i higher lvl than @Xaryu  am i a WoW nerd now ? PepeHands
[2:10:41] julienb95: Sad how the community did that to HC its a really fun game

[2:10:50] Mangled_Squeegee: will you be forced to do self found on the hardcore servers ?
[2:10:51] hoopyfrood12: p2 sod is going to be on farm for most people by the time ssf is  released, i think itll be fine
[2:10:52] julienb95: SF mode sounds fun
[2:11:00] Witality: KEKW
[2:11:01] Maiqthehighking: nothing new with hardcore release thats why not much hype
[2:11:04] NoGrave: same, just taking my time
[2:11:05] SghettiBoy: good for you honestly
[2:11:09] themadfeltcher: i kind of like that a lot of streamers aren't zooming to 40
[2:11:10] Matorey: I'm still 25 :(
[2:11:13] qtCrasH: @barskebaard when i was in server almost no one was playing before SoD, because everyone knew they’d just be on SoD. like i said just how it felt for me, not saying for everyone
[2:11:17] AceOfFlame: i thought you were 40...
[2:11:19] Slyxen: well you’re losing that then

[2:12:07] InnsaiyanTV: they shouldve waited with SF Hc way longer
[2:12:10] qtCrasH: hardcore was cool cause it was before GTA RP came back to twitch hype and there is surprisingly a lot of cross over, streamers and viewers
[2:12:12] hate_xyz: they should've just had one hardcore version lol
[2:12:13] wisescience: @angermanagmt Sleeping bag item, it’s new

[4:05:20] JoetheGrimm: I know a Dave’s Killer Bread when I see it
[4:05:21] knuuuunt: pog

[4:05:22] liightzouut: med well
[4:05:23] hclark0: had me in the first half ngl
[4:05:23] Ronin825: @Xaryu its because bacterias form on the top layer of the meat, and ground meat is mixed
[4:05:24] durzan9: safer
[4:05:26] cloudwarrior99: Fuck a well done steak
[4:05:30] edgycm: Yeah man it's like I'm not even here like you're a cartoon character and a monkey comes and speak with you man
[4:05:32] elinaip: medium rare always
[4:05:33] soltakar: grinding increases the chance of bacteria on the inside of the meat and med-rare is not hot enough to kill it
[4:05:33] ore0g: bro u should never eat a well done pork steak
[4:05:33] bloodstuck2000: Ground beef medium rare is just not cooked in the middle cuz its all seperate chunks
[4:05:33] Rygaros: youre a vampire
[4:05:36] miercoles_: beef only develops bacteria on the exposed surface. so inside the steak doesnt need to be cooked. ground beef exposes all layers of the meet.
[4:05:36] Yezna: medium
[4:05:38] spiros3421: Yoooo xarrr respect for the support on awc yesterday man !!

[4:05:57] asloff: so bm....
[4:05:58] psychedelicspecter: Pass me cutlery and a field
[4:05:58] GoldieGmoney: gotcha sick sick
[4:06:02] playerpersonx: chat it has nothing to do with quality of beef or "knowing where it comes from". It's because ground meat has bacteria spread throughout. A steak doesnt have that and you kill the bacteria by searing the outside
[4:06:03] wizzlebangreborn: @xaryu you literally look like Ryan Garcia, the professional boxer. look it up
[4:06:04] b_argy: xarCoC
[4:06:05] gubgubsr: beef only has bacteria that grow on the parts exposed to oxygen, so a steak the outside is only exposed to bacteria, but when you blend the meat it theoritcally is all exposed to bacteria due to increased surface area.
[4:06:05] Virzy: its because bacteria can grow anywhere inside (when its ground the "surface" gets mushed into every position if that makes sense) it so when the inside isn't cooked it doesn't kill it.  where like a steak it wont grow on the inside so you need to cook the inside as much
[4:06:18] r4men_noodle: Steak = Medium rare. Burger = Medium
[4:06:22] woreski: where do i quest at 32?
[4:06:26] Rhetaz: do you order your Big Mac medium rare?

[4:10:14] HonestPhilosophy: this bad addon paid him for sure
[4:10:14] TrooperHuge: @Tropicocity yup
[4:10:19] gubgubsr: @maximumdrip only thing that eating "RAW MEAT" (doesnt specifically say raw ground beef, you can eat raw meat as long as its relatively fresh) is that it destroys vitamin c and vitamin b12
[4:10:19] wizzlebangreborn: @xaryu you literally look like Ryan Garcia, the professional boxer. look it up

[4:10:38] lordixo: You can do pretty nifty searches like 'food' too
[4:10:38] Drbawler: @HonestPhilosophy LOL ! probely xd
[4:10:43] Spikeqc: @Germinate nonsense, that's not even the definition of "highly processed" but keep making bad faith arguments

[4:11:26] Aceydude: cause it says "Water"
[4:11:29] r4men_noodle: bagnon is bis
[4:11:33] maximumdrip: @gubgubsr you didn’t look very hard. or at all really “Raw beef is high in Vitamin B, and some say it’s beneficial for hormonal and reproductive health. Meanwhile, raw fish and oysters are packed with nutrients. That said, there are meats to avoid or eat in moderation if you’re eating raw.Aug 2, 2019”

[4:12:06] gubgubsr: @maximumdrip ive never even advocated for people to eat well done meat, ground beef cooked at 160f is not well done entirely and tastes fine and a rare steak is safe too.
[4:12:07] tkn0: works perfect for me

[4:13:36] hejrafa: Exactly!
[4:13:36] maximumdrip: @gubgubsr whether they take the beef and Grind it up or not. it’s still the same meat… and it’s still raw….
[4:13:36] TheFernandeez: are you going to host OTK tournament this time too? Would love to @Xaryu

[4:14:46] wprogress: @Kroski AdiBags is BiS. Tried everything and cannot use anything else
[4:14:50] gubgubsr: @maximumdrip i dont think you understand the fundamentals of how bacteria cultivates on beef. it only grows on exposed surface area, if you grind it up its all exposed. keep eating your raw ground beef if you feel fine, as long as your happy im happy, i dont even eat red meat lol.
[4:14:53] plafky: @Cheeezeburgerzzz boomkin
[4:14:55] morat_g: Bagnon looks like elvui, breaks immersion if ur a gnome rper

[4:16:42] maximumdrip: @gubgubsr of course there’s a risk of bacteria. I’ve gotten food poisoning multiple times from fast food restaurants where it was supposed cooked meat. you just have to have a brain and eat raw fresh meats. but there are benefits and I’ve never gotten sick from it when I have gotten sick from cooked meats.

[7:19:22] BombDiggy: mine is warstomp for shift space
[7:19:22] dankcheezits: What's the benefit of jumping though?
[7:19:22] clamshell24: i even make sure s-space is bound to jump
[7:19:23] Hanscakestealer: UR a keybind
[7:19:23] EbbandFlow_: Are you not using Q or E as a keybghind?
[7:19:24] vhanzom: I use alt keybinds

[7:19:28] BombDiggy: cause i cant warstomp in the air
[7:19:29] MrStLouis68: @Xaryu buy a greater mystc wand, cheap on ah
[7:19:31] sammixi: i see people bind scroll wheel to jump, then use spacebar, shift spacebar, ctrl spacebar, alt spacebar as new keybinds
[7:19:33] hoh0: dont bind space to jump
[7:19:33] Mastr0g: mousebutton 4 and 5 is bisssss
[7:19:35] zebercetanayurt: WTS Logitech g600
[7:19:36] voltrox1909: Teach the next generation.
[7:19:37] Gabe4D: I use alt mouse wheel for zoom in and out so I can use mouse wheel for other stuff
[7:19:37] nilleman1: keybinds is personal preference
[7:19:38] morat_g: damn hes thought this through
[7:19:39] kaizen421: @Alerothan we are trying to play wow bro don't make it political please.
[7:19:39] hoh0: scroll wheel
[7:19:40] stradtv: what about when you get rooted mid air?
[7:19:42] combatcojo: what's that mean
[7:19:45] ThatDudeSmallz: I have shift space as a switch to cat cast dash key bind and its great
[7:19:47] Meanpandah: I’ve only used shift as a modifier for ui healing.
[7:19:48] ShinyMatrex: @Xaryu Doesn't jumping with Cone of Cold also increase it's range
[7:19:50] Mastr0g: mousebutton 4 and 5 is bis NGL
[7:19:53] blizeontv: No you can you the keybind shift-spacebar in between your jumps its easy thats what I do

[7:19:58] evforge: what talents are you running for pvp xaryu
[7:19:58] Original_Cyko: @Alerothan It's not too hard.  It's just boring. I enjoyed the stories. I don't enjoy it the game play. That's why I think it's a bad expansion. That's why it's my opinion, not a fact.
[7:19:58] Reaperz_kinetic: @stradtv root isnt a CC theyre treated differently
[7:19:59] ReefeOW: but if u jump it makes it easier to track the headshot cuz the movemnt is predictable @Xaryu
[7:20:01] stako05: i dont think vanilla has that jumping inertia, i get stunned mid-air all the time in vanilla
[7:20:08] Mastr0g: mousebutton 4 and 5 is bis :)

[7:20:38] Alerothan: @Theado123 Quit talking about your shitty politics and seek help
[7:20:39] VacaSlamBang: dont slouch

[7:22:13] tuskraiderwow: copium
[7:22:13] yellowgaiden: i always jump and im not a pro
[7:22:15] BigjeffreyJones: well not melee though right because you can end up ranging yourself in instances you otherwise wouldn't
[7:22:15] zlovett08: im a pro :')
[7:22:16] kaizen421: @Theado123 bro stop we just want to play wow in peace

[7:23:26] SaucyStreamsLive: Its familiar to lots of people, but still SO much to learn about and find and build with
[7:23:27] Nicholas909: P1 was way better than P2

[7:23:27] knewks: i know p2 just came out but ima play p3 @ 60 heavy
[7:23:28] ShinuPK: @tsetse2fly thanks!

[7:23:40] Nicholas909: P1 was better imo
[7:23:41] anelko90: do u think SOD is gona die @Xaryu ?
[7:23:42] Duckduckgoose38: Ima level my mage next \o/
[7:23:50] EliasIsHere: why do you even jump than just stay still and cast?
[7:23:52] Mahca_: but good for most people with limited time
[7:23:53] Yamamoto78: runes were to easy to find this time, 4 druid runes were in desolace
[7:23:55] Nicholas909: feels like P2 doesnt have as much stuff to do
[7:23:56] MakeASplash: I've been holding off till P2 now cause I feel like only lvl 25 wasn't enough. Hopefully gonna resub this weekend with a friend
[7:24:02] SaucyStreamsLive: I waited to start leveling until P2 came out to extend my experience. Am currently up to 12 on my mage. First character in SoD
[7:24:04] stefkko24: didnt start p2 yet, waiting for full lvl
[7:24:06] Thrilluh: I tried explaining how sod is different (better) than normal classic era to some retail friends and they didn't understand how it was so much fun with the runs
[7:24:11] fetza108: @kaizen421 when i started retail like 1 year ago i literally did loremaster achievement to understand a little what is going on
[7:24:11] littlenicca: im gonna jump on sod tonight for the first time, might drop the good old mage and start warlock
[7:24:16] roztoky: Which level is twinking most fun to play?
