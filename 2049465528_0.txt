[0:43:09] Pradathelord: you just press it on a druid once
[0:43:10] alldamday: Do we have a bracket link for this qual?
[0:43:16] asleman1234: oh he's right there nvm
[0:43:17] Insanetaint404: It's just a utility dagger. not about the onuse.
[0:43:19] exteps: reduced in pvp tho by 50% gotta look at patch notes before the season started they nerfed all this shit
[0:43:24] pmanfit91: He just hit a Druid Treant for some reason. Check the buff.
[0:43:25] RossRyan05: can you get the buff and weap swap?
[0:43:28] lilplatotv: just send on the druid in form for the leech
[0:43:29] Sizzlaa: heart2Cheerup
[0:43:32] perraputaasco: But if u are winiing why u need to copy one who is loosing?xd
[0:43:32] OutlandishOW: thinking about this sht mid game seems cooked
[0:43:34] Pradathelord: even if its halved
[0:43:38] Pradathelord: 5% leech is good
[0:43:38] atorob: that really doesnt seem that great

[0:43:55] MasterKhanSaab: Guys what is a good salary to live a comfortable life in 2024?
[0:43:56] ralvich: does the 1% dmg reduction outweigh the stat differential
[0:43:57] Ciampion2024: maybe theyre trolling people inspecting them
[0:43:58] Incin_gaming: all 1% iin pvp
[0:44:00] raxxom: ???
[0:44:01] eZ_BFT: embedded ads lol
[0:44:04] Pradathelord: i use it on retail

[0:44:08] fridowskiy: its bad
[0:44:09] exteps: its good stats might as well
[0:44:12] lmaoerss: Why not use it
[0:44:16] baddragin: what item are we looking at
[0:44:16] Kreayx: it's better than 0
[0:44:17] Pradathelord: the stats are fine
[0:44:20] Pradathelord: and its equal ilvl
[0:44:20] whitebelt1337: its just a bonus?
[0:44:23] Incin_gaming: 1% on all dmg could be the difference in mirrors
[0:44:24] atorob: what stats come on it?
[0:44:25] lazyturtle0824: Yeah why not use it
[0:44:27] felstorms: they mostly give survivability buffs but outlaw is already immortal so it doesn't matter
[0:44:28] Pontacos: Well is it with out without? If thats the case then its better than not having it @Pikabooirl
[0:44:29] fawthespriest: pika whats the scores so far ?
[0:44:33] Nicohan95: idk if it gives you an edge
[0:44:33] teeths121: one buff is better than no buff
[0:44:33] fawthespriest: is this ur first game
[0:44:34] bennrie: most likely adds up in a damp match
[0:44:34] moistydank: I mean are the stats better than the pvp one
[0:44:40] moistydank: if so rock it lol
[0:44:41] MasterKhanSaab: @kaizen421 damn that's not too hard nowadays but yeah taxes D:
[0:44:43] agent_zeiss: use it in the aoe mechanical dummy like the other dude said
[0:44:44] Nicohan95: idk why you wouldn’t use it for the extra buff
[0:44:45] abadabada1: @Pikabooirl if it's 20 million damage taken it reduces 200k of that
[0:44:50] asloff: nahj is insane, that being said i think the pve dagger is jebait
[0:44:51] drewlivelyy: 10k shadow dmg reduction per 1 mil done
[0:44:54] smccart: mastery is better for killing spree
[0:44:55] IcyChillTV: @Pikabooirl PvE outlaw main 9/9M here, if you have even half decent uptime its crit >>> mastery or haste every day of the week. Pls go play versa crit. Mastery is not great, crit has so much synergy with ur procs
[0:44:57] Aro725: i feel like crit vers is too good
[0:44:57] ninetyninewc: do u want 30% vers or 45 vers
[0:44:58] blackvpnv: i know some outlaw play 40 % crit
[0:44:58] Xeriphim: I thought mastery was ass on combat did they change it"
[0:44:58] smccart: for finishing
[0:45:00] chervz: in pve outlaw goes crit/vers
[0:45:01] whitebelt1337: crit feels better ?
[0:45:03] tichoka: U can do 40% mastery 38 crit
[0:45:04] SpacemanJohn: did you enchant it even if you choose to not use?
[0:45:07] kallesurf: i think they aim for 40% crit then go mastery
[0:45:12] varok87: 30% crit 35% Vers, rest in to mast?
[0:45:13] moistydank: the buff might be just a random thing to use. they might have it for the stats and not the weapon effect
[0:45:14] Tinyful: I can't believe you don't have Pick Lock in your shortcut bar Kappa
[0:45:15] Sithrunn: Bte crits do x4 dmg might be using it for more burstier
[0:45:17] subhiim: depends which comb you play and vs which comb you play or?
[0:45:18] vernare1982: And proccing pistolshots too or ?
[0:45:19] Finejeeeeez: You gotta get your game face on tonight, Pika!!!
[0:45:20] necrotia113: situational for what comp you face?
[0:45:20] oz__tv: if u play mastery main gauch does the most dmg
[0:45:26] Kookamonga: Gotta make 2 rogues, one mas, one crit, keep em confused

[4:43:57] ItsJhelo: how can we see the current bracket for qualifiers
[4:44:08] RYUDOOOOOOOOO: cyclone needs a cooldown.
[4:44:10] Kanooog: @valandurrr I can only hope.... :/
[4:44:11] knappster15: Nerfing clone would actually kill feral and boomy
[4:44:25] RYUDOOOOOOOOO: Combined with the fact Druids can hardly be slowed or poly'd
[4:44:37] Kanooog: @RYUDOOOOOOOOO I agree, something, it's just insane.
[4:44:51] valandurrr: @Kanooog lol, same. just watching how much cc the druids have in this lobby is disgusting.
[4:44:55] ralvich: just kick cyclone? why nerf it
[4:44:59] ralphmen97: 5 DUBS FOR BEAN
[4:45:03] knappster15: Bean actually farmed that lobby sheeeeeeeesh

[4:45:14] chrye_xx: ooo feral 5-1 hell yeah
[4:45:18] sparticles: 🛩️
[4:45:19] OdysseyOG: told you. always sit feral
[4:45:19] Kanooog: @valandurrr They are the best at controlling the game, CC DPS... okay CC Healer... DPS. Nonstop
[4:45:24] numblezzz: the pvp reddit says that ferals need displacer beast. is it just druid propaganda?
[4:45:39] infiergo: Lost mmr tho
[4:45:39] chrye_xx: @kanooog sub still the best at controlling
[4:45:47] Kanooog: @ralvich The fact that it's super fast to cast is what makes it broken. Maybe a longer casting time.
[4:45:48] Stoten: !youtube
[4:45:50] quirkedupwyteboy: uhh yea yes please bring displacer beast back

[4:46:03] Kanooog: @chrye_xx Sub also doesn't work with just about every comp
[4:46:09] casztiel96: @numblezzz definitely. Last thing we need is more druids running amok
[4:46:20] miuxmoon: bring back symbiosis actually
[4:46:27] Kanooog: Plus Sub was nerfed big time
[4:46:29] quirkedupwyteboy: cringe
[4:46:30] chrye_xx: @kanooog neither does feral?.. sub has way more comps than feral lol
[4:46:33] Darthvendor: @miuxmoon pls no
[4:46:38] Kanooog: Hints everybody on the Outlaw Rogue train
[4:46:42] knappster15: If they nerf clone, they need to buff feral and boomy
[4:46:48] chrye_xx: feral is bottle necked into so many niche comps because it’s the squishiest spec in the game
[4:46:48] Kanooog: @chrye_xx I'm talking about Resto Druids
[4:46:48] knappster15: those specs die if clone gets nerfed
[4:46:56] chrye_xx: OH
[4:47:23] Argentdawne: what build u running for outlaw
[4:47:41] Kanooog: @knappster15 Feral Def needs a nerf, but Boomy is still powerful last I checked.. unless it got nerfed badly
[4:47:46] Kanooog: BUFF**
[4:47:49] Kanooog: haha my bad
[4:47:52] ibaepanda: I just got back into wow 3 days ago this solo shuffle is fun but the queue way too long

[4:47:59] chrye_xx: feral doesn’t need a nerf lol
[4:48:02] valandurrr: if gutting clone means feral gets buffed then that's okay because feral is in the gutter
[4:48:02] Stoten: are the awc vods anywhere
[4:48:07] averagenjoyerrrr: holy dent LULW
[4:48:07] knappster15: @Kanooog I thought you were actually smoking something for a sec LOL
[4:48:07] RYUDOOOOOOOOO: I don't mind cyclone 6 seconds. Its the fact you cant dispel it and its a easy re-cast. So your not really sitting 6 seconds. Your sitting a long ass time.
[4:48:13] Kanooog: @ibaepanda Try healer for fast ques

[4:50:32] ItsJhelo: Where can we watch todays AWC games and see the bracket?
[4:50:38] knappster15: @Kanooog They could give it a CD on resto. Or just buff boomy and feral while nerfing clone
[4:50:38] Kanooog: Jack,diet Coke, Vodka, SPrint ...something red solo cup
[4:50:47] knappster15: Boomy would FLOP if it cant clone to peel itself tho
