[0:34:30] Trajic: @chat after 60 you can group and raid like normal after being ssf right?
[0:34:30] inhaledthc: yd
[0:34:33] jessemus: gonna be hard to claim a full raid clear if all players arent ssf tho. but i guess its just for the achievement
[0:34:36] blazzedzz: Why not merge SF into HC servers down the road?

[0:34:56] thandelmtj: thandelmtj gifted a Tier 1 sub to TheHoeManZ! 
[0:34:57] cronetym1409: Over time the current servers should become SSF dominated as older characters die

[0:35:35] Trajic: @Nimbus723 oh that's actual a nice feature. if you are on a server that ends up dead.

[0:35:43] Phoenix3215: 4 months ago you decided to play SoD
[0:35:52] Nimbus723: @Trajic also to be clear, you can group in this game mode, it's only self found, not solo
[0:35:53] Gashunk1: I like how GGG thinks of PoE. A game made to be played forever
[0:35:59] JukezZA: does that mean that non sf people will be able to raid with sf people at 60??

[1:16:39] NotASkiller: When I quit mmos I give away large sums of currency

[1:17:15] Necrosizz: So basically do so at your own risk it sounds like
[1:17:30] LightBladeStream: Gold trading is literally gold buying. You sell in one game and buy in the other
[1:17:31] lyleneththedruid: Have they said anything about boosting and such?

[1:18:42] lyleneththedruid: @AceOfFlame Exactly, I don't think anyone has read the TOS

[1:19:22] MooseTorpedoMan: they need to make gold farming fun.. daily quests for a stack of materials and gold, something besides mindlessly farming dungeons or competing with bots for gold
[1:19:24] whamtv: @andypandynz it's the precedent in my opinion
[1:19:30] MooseTorpedoMan: right now gold farming is horribly unfun

[2:10:44] enigmasvea: tbc was so overhyped
[2:10:45] adina_v_: oh my god
[2:10:47] frozeusgaming: WoD killed Wow in the sense of being a 8 figure concurrent game. it's about 2/10 of what it used to be.

[2:11:14] chazmc89: yes

[2:11:24] legallydanm: TBC was great
[2:11:25] bhixx: make it harder!
[2:11:25] Reaperz_kinetic: nope fuck em it made it way better
[2:11:25] Macehaed: i never saw sunwell either
[2:11:26] EbbandFlow_: I cleared kara
[2:11:27] bassey_: I only cleared karazhan and BT
[2:11:27] sbaldwin9__1: i mostly pvped
[2:11:28] droogle_: i hardly knew what raiding was back then, loved every second of the game still
[2:11:28] Alacay: nope. wasn't even relevant at that time
[2:11:29] sabsab4: no, I was part of that 99%
[2:11:29] Saturos47: people are too entitled now
[2:11:30] NawtyTyme: i cleared it in the wrath pre patch
[2:11:31] Zoismoe: nobody cared if we cleared back then 😂
[2:11:31] Ionfreeze: yea definitely tough but we had a solid guild on Burning Legion server
[2:11:31] JEM_GG: vanilla I was clueless lol
[2:11:32] LimpsNoodles: never played TBC
[2:11:32] itsjake92: meta gaming did not exist then
[2:11:33] shalomski: I loved strolling around in my t6 whilst most didn't have
[2:11:33] valentinooo: exactly!
[2:11:34] serverfirst300003: nope it was an honor to clear raid back then, if u were one of those ppl u were a god
[2:11:35] Rysilk: I know I am in the minority but BC is my least favorite expac
[2:11:36] eskivoart: its so sad well never experince that again
[2:11:36] Mandoogles: my guild was terrible but we enjoyed kara and gruuls lol
[2:11:36] TheClane: but we were different then. we had no resources, we did not know a lot of things.. was a different world
[2:11:37] onkelwrnr: didnt care. Didnt get to play with pro CS gamers and experience endgame scene either
[2:11:37] Elmo3141: i fucking loved it too, Arena and heroics were cool
[2:11:37] Phoenix3215: I finally killed Illidan at the end of TBC
[2:11:39] Reaperz_kinetic: JK I was a kid and I was a nub too😂
[2:11:39] AbyssReborn: all I did was twink PVP KEKW
[2:11:39] enigmasvea: you were also 10
[2:11:39] rns_aurelius: mythic raids are kind of what that is now
[2:11:39] berrychronic: same
[2:11:40] oldkappa123: TBC was the best man
[2:11:41] Eepingmoo: was this pre-recorded?
[2:11:41] x_jdot: it was never an expectation
[2:11:41] ZapyuR1: it was more items to loot
[2:11:41] Jullsan: same
[2:11:42] AceOfFlame: during 2006, i only cleared Kara and part of SS and that was it
[2:11:43] coronalight18: YEP
[2:11:43] ZapyuR1: than to clear
[2:11:43] Nonprophetx: tbc classic was really underrated. i liked tbc more than wotlk.
[2:11:43] onlinejutsu: It was nice for the community
[2:11:44] taylorsdank: it’s what made it magical
[2:11:45] Lanolinlol: standing in IF in full t6 with the priest on a stick on my back was peak wow for me
[2:11:47] MonkeyOverlord: Clearing raid isn't all of WoW. PVP isn't all of WoW. Professions, lore, quests aren't all of WoW.
[2:11:48] themadfeltcher: I ended up clearing TBC, but I had to join a diff guild to complete Sunwell
[2:11:50] sighwarlock: Kids nowdays dont care about hardwork and shit like that. They want it handed to them
[2:11:50] Greencrackx: same
[2:11:52] chazmc89: tbc was great, its was only really the top guilds on the servers that had cleared BT and MH
[2:11:52] berrychronic: preach!
[2:11:53] MaisLa0712: the very first open world boss, the one like onyxia. I was in a top raiding guild with all server firsts and the boss did "shatter"
[2:11:53] lukemeleney: heroic dungeons then were a good time
[2:11:55] Bishox: KEKW
[2:11:56] bouginio: #ad
[2:11:58] NoGrave: We finished all but Illidan back then.
[2:11:59] NawtyTyme: subtle
[2:12:01] NoXeVo: Yeah, I cleared content when the next xpac came out.
[2:12:02] RealitySuks: I started playing the end of TBC and was still learning the game. Don't even think I hit max level until WotLK
[2:12:02] andypandynz: its still like that? people arent clearing mythic endbosses
[2:12:03] Juberski: i never cleared nefarian back in vanilla but loved the game
[2:12:04] hardliquor: should be like that
[2:12:06] onlinejutsu: Seeing guild members or well known characters on the server  accomplish goals was amazing
[2:12:07] MaisLa0712: im not remembering the name but bruh, prenerf that was BRUTAL
[2:12:07] Nevermolly: me and my guild where the only ones clearing swp on the server before LK
[2:12:08] Maybe_Canadian: It was a different time, now you can see it all online
[2:12:08] GigaToons: I liked the days you looked at a character and knew they were awesome!!
[2:12:09] ddraggbagg: Amen. Should always be something to work towards, not just a chore to get loot. @Xaryu
[2:12:10] daijahaden: Sounds good in theory, but we were kids then. The entitled 30 something wow player base just isn't going to accept that nowadays. There'd be a riot.
[2:12:10] SmashTheDude: IT'S a life lesson for many tbh @Xaryu
[2:12:11] enigmasvea: @Xaryu you liked it cus you were 10 years old KEKW
[2:12:13] qtCrasH: it’s not a problem for players but a problem for blizzard business since that means theoretically more people will end their sub pre maturely
[2:12:14] juice42069: i thouhgt it was serpentshrine cavern
[2:12:16] sighwarlock: Kids these days want everyone in though, and won't play if its not that way.
[2:12:18] lukemeleney: man, our first Archimonde kill was awesome
[2:12:20] ayaooazz: i was 12 years old i was just happy to be in a raid
[2:12:20] BlueBrit: It's a massive problem, Xar.
[2:12:20] Knocktoff: my guild wasnt able to clear gnomer week one, and i thought that was awesome
[2:12:20] nutz_hang_uneven: tbc classic was better than wrath classic
[2:12:21] themadfeltcher: I feel like as long as they can do SOME raids, it's fine, like MC vs Naxx
[2:12:21] x_jdot: nope
[2:12:22] YermGames: less then 1%
[2:12:24] jumpalottahigh: now ppl complain about not getting crafted epics in SoD in 2 weeks
[2:12:24] onlinejutsu: they were server legends
[2:12:25] whamtv: STV EVENT?
[2:12:25] bassey_: raid finder is a problem
[2:12:25] Gashunk1: not many
[2:12:26] Phoenix3215: You had to deal with raid leaders like Dives if you wanted to kill Illidan
[2:12:26] LexaproNLattes: The fact people not only got 40 on day 1 and cleared gnomer day 1 i think is what is ruining SoD. Progression is barely a thing anymore
[2:12:26] darkeh24: probably the same % as now
[2:12:30] andypandynz: @sighwarlock thats a boomer thing lookat sod..
[2:12:30] macjcool: its a dumb model to appease the 1%
[2:12:31] onlinejutsu: back on my server like 4 guilds were raiding well
[2:12:32] sbaldwin9__1: i only did curent raiding in legion
[2:12:32] TanHeezy: true
[2:12:32] Juveniledelinquent: it is not possible anymore cuz  is sweat and minmax nowdays
[2:12:32] haptic_g: played the heck out of vanilla, never step foot in naxx
[2:12:32] Elmo3141: Classic was WAAAAAAAAY less than 1&
[2:12:33] x_jdot: it was
[2:12:34] bigwilly3737: @enigmasvea no we liked it bc it was a good game
[2:12:35] tomker12: streamer min max is toxic ^^
[2:12:36] Ervill1: i never killed illidan, not even today LUL
[2:12:36] coronalight18: end game content should be harder
[2:12:37] Bishox: @Xaryu i need bis loot 1 month in xar you dont understand even if i play bad
[2:12:39] sheltereddougy: when China got TBC Black Temple was cleared first week
[2:12:39] Elmo3141: Kel slayers were rare
[2:12:39] Knocktoff: POLL
[2:12:40] Bishox: KEKW
[2:12:41] xDeathzDezignx: I agree w you
[2:12:42] Zoismoe: great thing
[2:12:44] HilmKang: couldn’t agree more
[2:12:46] NoGrave: We did in wrath, out guild was raid focused by then
[2:12:50] Mestema17: similar to mythic raids now.
[2:12:50] oldkappa123: 100% agree
[2:12:51] sighwarlock: @andypandynz im a zoomer, i havent had a single friend even talk about WoW.
[2:12:52] NoGrave: our*
[2:12:55] yumyumchubs: If that happened now, it would fail because the game is built around those raids if you don't do pvp
[2:12:56] chazmc89: content should be fucking hard
[2:12:57] disabledengineer: an extra boss
[2:12:59] ginjakk: exactly
[2:12:59] Bjornaa: i agree
[2:12:59] regularbuff: Wrath I think a lot of people did
[2:12:59] yexulz: thats literally wows problem, everything is instant gratification instead of a grind thats rewarding
[2:13:01] Reaperz_kinetic: people just started getting mad they couldn’t kill things and wanted participation trophies which is why we’ve added different difficulties with varying degrees of mechanics
[2:13:03] s0Iidd: nowadays the player base is 99% sweat
[2:13:03] Poobster: thats why i dont like retail, its WAY too easy and everyone gets the same gear handed to them
[2:13:03] Boumpie: I was 16 during Vanilla, and we didnt even cleared BFD, because we only had 1hr an evening lol
[2:13:05] jiggsawpuzzlemanes: Must be nice wipe after wipe and not getting shit KEKW @xaryu
[2:13:06] qtCrasH: that’s FromSoftware nowadays, Blizzard 20 years ago
[2:13:07] BlueBrit: The problem is the cry babies that want free shiny loot each and every week
[2:13:10] gachonio: times have changed & expectations aswell
[2:13:12] Bioaim7: agree
[2:13:12] NoGrave: getting 'key'd' was part of it
[2:13:15] andypandynz: @sighwarlock exactly? its aboomer thing??
[2:13:15] abzurth: Thats why we get Ashes of Creation
[2:13:18] Degran: What's crazy is Vanilla had 6+ Million people playing and almost no one ever did a raid. It was just the world.
[2:13:18] infuze27: imagine how much higher rating you coulda got with all the pve gear back then
[2:13:21] NoXeVo: @Xaryu I remmeber have AQ40 gear in classic and shitting on everyone else. I then get whispered if I'd sell my account haha
[2:13:22] serverfirst300003: i mean thats what made Classic so popular, cause even us boomers not always had a chance to clear all classic content when we were in college but we had time to do it in 2019
[2:13:23] infuze27: wish I would have raided
[2:13:23] sighwarlock: @andypandynz and thats why its dying
[2:13:24] chazmc89: problem is it turned into a babied 'family' game
[2:13:27] FamSisher: or too many people would find a way to cheese or cheat their way
[2:13:30] itsjake92: Yep too late to switch back to that model now sadge
[2:13:34] Lotus_III: if everyone is special then no one is
[2:13:37] sabsab4: Problem wasn't aspiring to it, to do the end content you had to be in specific guilds.
[2:13:37] DBGmal: TBC bis
[2:13:38] cutiesxd: tabard of frost prime reward
[2:13:39] xNiccypoo: SOD arena PLEASE!
[2:13:47] ndras: p4 when we get loads of shit for each class they should rework MC and make it hard af
[2:13:53] texxx409: I been playing blizzard games since diablo 1 came out ,  if you'd like a true insight you'd ask me
[2:13:56] Elmo3141: I got glad back then and I fucking suck
[2:13:56] grylz89: So true
[2:13:59] coronalight18: there is so much information available that if you READ things you can learn so quickly
[2:14:03] kleptomaggs: literally just cuz they have BIS lists lol
[2:14:05] espenenenen: ive played wow for 15 years now and i have never killed the current end boss LUL
[2:14:07] garais530: obtaining keys for raids was fun
[2:14:09] yolcina: retail raiding is kind of like that right now @xaryu
[2:14:10] curv6: thottbot
[2:14:12] UnsafeCell: call me a bad player???
[2:14:13] phatsacklg: chilling in shattrath with an t6 item was so a nice feeling tho
[2:14:15] richdawg: yeah but I got thotbott
[2:14:16] frederikv225: back then you was full natty bro
[2:14:17] thesirganks: I still get some of those tbh
[2:14:18] itsjake92: Yep information is more readily available. Shout out content creators.
[2:14:19] bigwilly3737: @xNiccypoo no one wants arena in sod go play retail if u want it
[2:14:21] coronalight18: imagine runes without forums and youtube to tell you where everything was
[2:14:21] bhixx: wow forums was where it was at back in the day
[2:14:21] ybadmind: Skill capped
[2:14:21] fishb0mb: buy the strategy guide
[2:14:22] NawtyTyme: dam keyboard turners
[2:14:23] drpaulyd: DBM and Warcraft logs changed the game completely
[2:14:27] sighwarlock: /shrug
[2:14:30] Saint_Vallion: retail KEKW
[2:14:33] yumyumchubs: back then I used charge and immolation aura in metamorphosis on warlock
[2:14:33] wreckstormx: i wont
[2:14:35] siggysudzz: we know already we watch pikaboo
[2:14:38] frederikv225: true
[2:14:40] oldkappa123: retail KEKL
[2:14:40] Bishox: KEKW  󠀀
[2:14:40] grylz89: @xaryu tbc arena was all about who had keybinds and who didn't tbh lol
[2:14:40] darkeh24: people would break sheep constantly
[2:14:47] sheltereddougy: can’t have the average player base be good and keep a sense of unknown/exploration so it’s a trade off
[2:14:50] amarv: Moving everywhere with S
[2:14:51] dibadibb: many noobs couldnt even get past the starting zones
[2:14:53] curv6: STV?
[2:14:55] Trodenskjold: People still break sheep all the time
[2:14:59] yolcina: I dont think more than 8% or something kills final boss on Mythic in retail
[2:15:01] 77courtjester77: @Xaryu I remember when juking a kick felt INSANE to watch in pvp vids
[2:15:06] sighwarlock: well peoples computers are actually doing what we press as we press it now
[2:15:07] suppazz: I just opened spell book and casted lol
[2:15:08] SilentWisco: Alliance Shaman !!!!!!!!
[2:15:08] sighwarlock: not 10 seconds later
[2:15:11] brahmanes97: sw: death is a rune cuh
[2:15:18] wreckstormx: i was pretty good back then, but very bad compared to todays standards, but i never improved LUL
[2:15:29] serverfirst300003: @Trodenskjold lol.. thats not what he mean, he meant breaking sheep by swd, because u take dmg from swd
[2:15:45] NawtyTyme: 40k is pretty decent
[2:15:45] yumyumchubs: I still think the warcraft graphical style has helped it way more than people realize
[2:15:47] erectiliann: @xaryu Madseasons voice moistens my loins
[2:15:47] s0Iidd: 40k is crazy
[2:15:53] romanisroamin: Can u cast SW death while poly? Or is the self dmg tick late enough that you time it right before u get sheeped?
[2:15:54] oussamahouri: wotlk <# best xpac ever
[2:15:55] Duckacubed: WOTLK POGGERS

[2:16:22] aniki_lover: the blue lich king OOOO
[2:16:22] Ardal_Obe: vehicle combat existed in TBC
[2:16:23] CoolTV: @ndras facts
[2:16:24] FaluranTV: i think the game is at a point where new expansion announcements just dont have the hype they used to. because its largely reworked content not new content
[2:16:24] Moronomics: I just want to be a kiiid playing this game for the first time again so much happiness
[2:16:25] Zoismoe: this shit was epic bro

[2:18:40] Catalystic_Sudo: bro why am I in a queue for wow?!
[2:18:51] sighwarlock: @ipntheshower also blizz fault for allowing that imbalance to take place.

[2:19:03] zarillon1: what about cosmetics that u can get from actual gameplay
[2:19:04] yumyumchubs: the problem is the cosmetics make so much money that they have pull for future development
[2:19:07] juice42069: @andypandynz youd rather pay 20$ than 50 cents?
[2:19:14] bralter: race changes give power...thats why rwf guilds transfer to an entire race for that extra % output
[2:19:16] kirk_hunts: YO are we going STV?

[2:19:20] joonelius3: the cosmetics take away from people who have been collecting cosmetics.

[2:21:01] 94explorer: @zen0vae new world is a great example of that agreed

[2:30:24] apexariestv: so why rogue for sf
[2:30:33] ZapyuR1: healing
[2:30:35] chipchronly: + healing doesn't help that spell
[2:30:36] macjcool: no
[2:30:38] lexicon67: Okay, lets talk about chances of inviting... chances of inviting 1 priest, hile you have 10 classes is 1:10. ... if you invite twice chances are 1:100... so chances of infiting 4 priests are 1:10000 - 10 on 4...
[2:30:41] Merkkinz: ya
[2:30:45] batchestspam: its not +healing only +damage tho?
[2:30:49] Merkkinz: you'd need to get naked

[2:31:18] PumpkinTME: What level did you start going to STV?
[2:31:18] 1cyveins: HUH
[2:31:20] daveyddz: cast with staff 10 times, take average non crit.  repeat without staff. compare results
[2:31:22] little508: i need one
[2:31:26] Griff_666: Yea its arcane frost or fire not healing
[2:31:28] Klagartin: Irridated also makes you a target @Xaryu cause everyone knows its -400 health.
[2:31:30] CubicleGangster: test it by using +arcane gear
[2:31:34] kleptomaggs: @lexicon67 assuming class distribution is equal
[2:31:34] MongoSecurity: Yeah that dude is tryna see you naked LUL
[2:31:38] CubicleGangster: go buy a piece.
[2:31:45] Witality: Chat did the druid give him the staff yesterday?
[2:31:49] nykkjen1: Get naked, equip a +heal item, see the % in total and do the same for staff, you can eyeball if it does give or not :)

[2:33:13] grimnor375: still not a damage effect

[2:33:40] lexicon67: @iPlayx64 you need to hit hard... elites can kill you
[2:33:41] Genghish: Im in that half

[2:34:42] TheButler_: @94explorer SeemsGood
[2:34:45] CubicleGangster: that should be enough +arcane to test.
[2:34:50] mistybuster: yes it scales of ur dmg spellpower, (arcane fire frost not healing spellpower
[2:34:58] Reaperz_kinetic: the reality is chat doesn’t know what they’re talking about. none of us do including you the only way to really know is for someone to test it
[2:34:58] Witality: Did Gualtieria give you the staff after raid? Must have missed it
[2:35:03] Merkkinz: My guess is that it would get both bonuses.
[2:35:03] tiris_of_gad: if you have shatter and heal someone in a nova. does it get the crit %
[2:35:11] JokiGhostCrew: Feels like the Event destroyed the soul of STV and they should have done the event in Arathi instead

[2:52:38] CIamzy: Cranky dude
[2:52:40] Curtsy: @TheButler_ It's very dumb but it's the reason why even classic lags in large scale pvp, every single version of wow is on a modern client linked up to the same infrastructure

[3:09:53] oTrentx: Does it automatically show your blood stack? Or is that an addon?
[3:09:53] shalomski: Wow how bad, how hard to drop down to the right spot and aoe, and heal just heals mostly with pom
[3:09:55] priestialityg: seems better on OCE, we farmed 2900 one event, couple of the guildies got >3k
[3:09:58] eyonixz: get like 2k every time with 5 mages

[3:10:47] RealitySuks: I'd be happy with at least 500 per event. People getting 2k plus are some chads
[3:10:50] ThighLover_: hop on oldschool runescape
[3:10:59] Razzlee: I usually get around 300 per, last night I did it with a group and got 1600
[3:11:04] Pr0fan1ty: just dive bombing alter as fire, blast wave and arcane explosion
[3:11:04] auroturtle: !server
[3:11:04] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA

[3:11:08] kazmiio: Very unsure which mage type I wanna go... I wanna pvp and raid
[3:11:11] nerfjoos: Yeah 4 mage and a healer is best way
[3:11:15] lasershark1: so glad you can use that spirit healer after the event ends now
[3:11:23] nfernal_majesty: video from earlier?
[3:11:24] lukemeleney: but what if .... bengal
[3:11:25] OGTigolebitties: I get around 400-500 each event doing what you were doing there with rain of fire then jump in and hellfire as a warlock
[3:11:34] 94explorer: @kazmiio respecs are cheap brother, play em all!
[3:11:38] Pr0fan1ty: Mage has raptor mount and all the rings workin on that ab rep now lol

[3:11:58] Vevovic: 9000/200
[3:12:02] Sammah0: 210 silver from zero to exalted
[3:12:06] Anubitxx: AB wasite is BIS
[3:12:14] lasershark1: the gnomer one is only better for fire
[3:12:18] blazzedzz: I'd get the mount lol
[3:12:34] enigmasvea: tiger > gear
[3:12:39] DragoncakezZz: thats bis for arcane
[3:12:45] JayAnders: did someone say you can use the spirit healer thing to res in STV without the event going on?
[3:12:46] beablekiel: !spec
[3:12:46] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[3:12:46] themadfeltcher: yeah I'm torn between tiger and AB rep too

[3:13:16] inspiredtv: how many coins for revered?
[3:13:18] MewhTV: @Xaryu belt > mount tbh
[3:13:22] TkingAJ: If u just farm zg as mage u get 1k ez
[3:13:24] Pr0fan1ty: lag is bis when running into large grps u can spam arcane explosion and get kills before they target u
[3:13:24] TurtleHoptv: get the belt and never go back to STV... got it
[3:13:25] wavecadet: You can also drop group, and have everyone else drop group, and youll get layered to a less full layer
[3:13:33] ddevillax: i dont do bg's for the rep i do it cause its fun
[3:13:34] TheeSpaz: What's your favorite color?
[3:13:36] spenstig_: about 80 silver for revered

[3:13:39] lilzenzay505: Go back to Madseason video!
[3:13:40] niv4g: they need to bring AB down from 2k points to 1600 for a win
[3:13:43] coronalight18: 5 caps only!
[3:13:43] Razzlee: For me the mount will get replace when I hit 60 since it is not epic, the rep will be probably good for 60
[3:13:45] YuraruY: yo man how do u make ur game not be grey when ur dead? i saw u as a ghost and the game looked with normal colors
[3:13:46] inhaledthc: i got mine today
[3:13:48] Lagbolta: @xaryu The belt is temporary......the mount is forever
[3:13:48] themadfeltcher: Horde wins AB a lot too
[3:13:50] 5thD5thD: the AB grind is SLOW
[3:13:51] adam_brisbane: lose 1 fso you can turn your marks in
[3:13:54] lasershark1: yeah for the time it takes to get 1 AB win, it's equivalent to just 1 silver coin from bloodmoon
[3:13:55] kazmiio: Is frost really that bad in this phase ? for pvp
[3:13:57] themadfeltcher: AB is fun tho imo
[3:13:59] Jointmike: @niv4g no
[3:14:00] themadfeltcher: more fun than WSG
[3:14:01] Sowiloo: tiger is bis
[3:14:06] lyleneththedruid: Exactly.
[3:14:16] enigmasvea: tiger is replaced by 100% mount
[3:14:16] Nimbus723: mount is only until p4 really
[3:14:17] nimonic_llt: unmotivated
[3:14:17] kindaopmusic: ur almost there
[3:14:18] williwhite94: i mean SOM will end lol
[3:14:18] hjortjaegarn: The rep is also forever
[3:14:19] blazzedzz: We going back to mad season?
[3:14:20] yuky11: does the mount speed scale though? otherwise its kinda wasted time
[3:14:22] graziNNN: I got like 650 copper just now, ehhh
[3:14:23] SurrealAndre: doesnt the belt have value later on too, better stats higher tiers
[3:14:24] Tybow0811: Buying the rep with tokens from scratch is like 40 silver coins. Totally worth the time investment
[3:14:24] hjortjaegarn: with new waists each phase
[3:14:26] Razzlee: the mount is getting replaced by epic mount at 60
[3:14:26] Reaperz_kinetic: i mean the mount isnt forever cause p4 its irrelevant
[3:14:28] danielbanks: Leaning Raptor as I'm alliance but Saber is sick too. Hard choice
[3:14:29] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[3:14:29] Plaguethong: But do delivering silver coins give AB rep?

[3:14:48] JayAnders: did someone say you can use the spirit healer thing to res in STV without the event going on?
[3:14:52] themadfeltcher: Man MAge belt so much better than Shamang
[3:14:53] sick0w: you can do the AB quests  in Arathi with like 2 more AB's for some extra rep
[3:14:53] ponaris: join a mage group when it is fixed you can get 1.5k+ per event
[3:14:55] Razzlee: Rep > mount for sure
[3:14:58] lasershark1: LUL
[3:14:59] smoore48: especially while people are doing event heavy now

[3:17:10] beablekiel: whats the weak aura that shows the missile barage ?
[3:17:20] lasershark1: the most frustrating thing in AB pugs is too many people rotating to a node after an inc call and leaving the rest of the nodes open

[3:44:48] danielbanks: Just reserve the neck from gnomer xarEZ
[3:44:48] ketchgg: i think its actually more efficient to just kill the mobs that can respawn as the rares instead of leaving and resetting, not sure though xaryu
[3:44:48] Zulaxy: they respawn if you kill the mob that stands where the rares are and stay inside the dung
[3:44:56] Sgt_TBag: doesn't he also drop Necrotic wand?
[3:44:57] Chrigss: i've run this 25+ times and have not seen the neck

[4:16:44] cory_lockman: W
[4:16:44] TClear: but nobody is doing that in classic sod lol
[4:16:44] epicninja808: 90% of people spammed SM
[4:16:45] trmonx: not in SOD you dont its all about phases
[4:16:45] candy_fingers: not wrong lol. thats why people are paying massive gold to get the sleeping bag fast
[4:16:45] Leviosor: BUT WITH ALTS ITS TERRIBLE
[4:16:45] melononenkopf: i just wanna play endgame asap its much more fun for me

[4:16:53] xfreedoooomx: that’s what made classic so great
[4:16:53] hairfair88: I hate xp buffs, and I'm an altoholic
[4:16:54] KosmicDevil_: should give you rhe buff if you have a lvl 40 on ur account
[4:16:54] Ardal_Obe: scarlet monastery begs to differ
[4:16:54] ellgthompson: phase1 was way better when everyone had alts imo
[4:16:55] cookie_jayy: then again SoD is TESTING stuff its really only to test
[4:16:55] epicninja808: THE LEVELING EXP OF SPAMMING SM
[4:16:56] Phoenix3215: I have 5 alts at 31
[4:16:56] nitro_pain: I just hit 40 today lol
[4:16:57] xperiment01: endgame > leveling on classic as well
[4:16:57] Origi94: it’s great if you don’t have time to play…
[4:16:58] habibitwitch07: not everyone can play 6-12 Hours on day
[4:16:58] overlandingaggie: PEOPLE ARE ONLY DUNGEON SPAMMING ALREADY
[4:16:59] Yamamoto78: ppl are spamming dungeons to 40 anyways they arent doing the experience
[4:17:01] adam_brisbane: it says midway point
[4:17:02] TocaRed: new player join the raid ok
[4:17:02] Zacrilioth: why dont they just increase xp from quest turn-ins by 100%???
[4:17:04] boydcs: Are u going to play self found? @Xaryu
[4:17:04] johnulux: where’s the Spider-Man’s pointing at each other Meme for retail/classic
[4:17:04] SmugJerry: RIP SODCORE
[4:17:04] key_321: what server are you on xaryu?
[4:17:04] bramilol: grinding dungeon amazing experience yes wow amazing
[4:17:05] jaysstwotime: not really, people are already trying to rush to 40 so they can do the latest raid, get BiS gear, and world pvp etc.
[4:17:06] gaurdianjojo: Should stay 50%
[4:17:06] realandtruephobe: I legit just leveled an alt to 40 AND bought mount lol. I'm salty
[4:17:06] dado_inc: whats the opinion ... all lvl in SM xp runs... thats not lvl like classic
[4:17:06] o0darling0o: 50% less SM Spam
[4:17:06] YangKuO: bru h literally every spams SM for 10 levels
[4:17:06] ImSo1337: it should be for alts only
[4:17:07] krulfar: its week 2, not needed at all
[4:17:07] themanjake2020: @Xaryu No ones playing the game aside of spamming SM so no one is playing the game bud
[4:17:08] Toshiba16: I enjoy the slow leveling in SoD. First time classic player. I am lvl 26 now @Xaryu
[4:17:09] Bolt_: I didn't spam SM
[4:17:10] ArkanisRP: @Xaryu  Sod should be/remain alt-friendly.
[4:17:11] adam_brisbane: yo sure months it says midway point
[4:17:11] purplewingedboa: I would love if it was only for dungeons. So if you want to just level fast and grind you can but if you want to play in the world and quest it's the normal pace.
[4:17:12] Bolt_: i took my time
[4:17:12] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu phase 3 like mid late April
[4:17:12] cory_lockman: huge W people dont enjoy leveling anymore. That was dead back in 07. People rushed to max level in 2019 and doing it again in 2024
[4:17:12] hotspitta: people have alot of alts and they want people to be able to be max level on mulitple characters without wasting your whole life
[4:17:12] MattOriginal: It's a BIG W
[4:17:12] madsfrozt: But xaryu, you have a bunch of time to do this
[4:17:13] wheelchairsiv: @Xaryu if ur living in 2004, yes leveling is the experience but not in 2024... everyone hates the slow paced leveing that everyone did a million times on repeat
[4:17:13] gaurdianjojo: I don't like either
[4:17:14] Dazed24: yeah but some people dont get 8 hours to play like you streamers
[4:17:14] Toastedyogurt: too much too fast
[4:17:15] the_ordo_malleus: They should make it an NPC you can talk to if you want to turn it on.
[4:17:16] Tsuness: we are almost a month into phase 2 lol
[4:17:17] Jim_Boozie: sod is saved holy shit this is awesome
[4:17:17] CIamzy: I'm level 33 on my main D:

[4:17:23] ellgthompson: people dont even level in the outworld
[4:17:23] lordsloths: huge L
[4:17:24] jbeemerks: you don’t enjoy alts?
[4:17:25] somsomxo: not everyone has wow as a job
[4:17:25] Almighty_kenzo: This shit damn near retail
[4:17:25] Zacrilioth: Just make quest xp increased by 100%
[4:17:26] brumstool: Next comes level boosts
[4:17:26] williwhite94: SoD wont last forever so its a good change lol @Xaryu
[4:17:27] lilecho93: yea not everyone has all day to play wow lol
[4:17:28] moons07: Exactly @Xaryu
[4:17:28] cookie_jayy: ITs a TEST game server who cares,
[4:17:28] kirbiez: Theres nothing to do rn, they need alts in the mix
[4:17:28] mackh2012: 50% would probably be ok, but 100% is a lot
[4:17:29] lHlUlLlK: we're grown we dont have time to quest 12hr a day
[4:17:29] ellgthompson: its all dungeeon spam anyway
[4:17:29] stekkermane: @Xaryu poll chat
[4:17:30] Astralthundr: its been 1 month...
[4:17:32] CIamzy: Big L
[4:17:32] kenobi_sod: We'll only have meta classes everywhere around
[4:17:35] violettge: i am not liking the course they are taking by removing all the friction its such a slippery slope
[4:17:35] Xzanelol: gold sellers malding rn at the gold increase
[4:17:35] priestialityg: people need those 40 lvls to learn to play their class before gnomer
[4:17:36] HoRiiZoN17: The leveling experience is Stocks spam then SM spam
[4:17:36] pattycake448: this seems like a big redflag in the direction blizzard is going with sod
[4:17:36] SilverBugeye: TIME IS MONEY, FRIEND
[4:17:38] marcusartz: its sod
[4:17:38] YzieGG: allows more alts
[4:17:38] Gagax2990: people saying L, please elaborate on why its bad
[4:17:38] LightBladeStream: The pacing of the questing zones will be completely screwed
[4:17:38] epicninja808: wow spamming SM is such a good leveling xp
[4:17:39] prfssrzaddy: Major L
[4:17:39] SurrealAndre: this will hurt more considering how long each phase lasts
[4:17:40] ripprrooster: Agreed
[4:17:40] calderwood11: it will be nice getting alts up that you might not play in phase 2 but might want in phase 3
[4:17:40] hotmanpop: yeah but people just go grind dungeons, so does it change anything.. @Xaryu 󠀀
[4:17:40] alexrose7: Thats an LLLLLL
[4:17:40] krulfar: if they add this kinda stuff ill just play retail tbh
[4:17:41] ArkanisRP: if you hate it, get off ur one class, explore, DISCOVER
[4:17:41] Tsuness: Classic era exists for people who want that though Xar
[4:17:41] chrisrev: justt in streamer who plays game for a living has disconnect with reality
[4:17:42] rocknsake: yeah the game is so slow right now that i can barely stand to play.  this is all great
[4:17:42] adumb25: Having it mid-way the phase respects people's time on their main and then gives them a chance to level alts faster
[4:17:42] serverfirst300003: shit like this brings classic closer to retail
[4:17:42] Neiro66: y i'm not a streamer i don't have that much time
[4:17:43] Shogunator_: i think the buff should be for alts only
[4:17:43] CIamzy: Leveling my fav part
[4:17:43] key_321: WHAT SERVER IS XAR ON?
[4:17:43] Slaybooty: Does anyone know what server savix is on??  Does anyone know what server savix is on??  󠀀
[4:17:44] Ardal_Obe: DadWoW confirmed
[4:17:44] Bolt_: They should've just made that buff for people who hit 40 on another character
[4:17:44] ColePowerz: classic fanbase are mostly Adults witha  job and family
[4:17:44] rns_aurelius: the levelling experience and journey amounts to hours in sm for most people its not engaging
[4:17:44] akaYosher: JUST BRING IN SOD TOKEN ALREADY
[4:17:46] realandtruephobe: SM spams will be LIGHTNING speed now
[4:17:46] JayyyRS: I like this ONLY for alts - not for 1st/main character
[4:17:46] Pyrenean: Issue is that with this kind of OP characters with runes, it feels so bad to spend your time walking for quests. It's not classic anymore
[4:17:46] stekkermane: poll
[4:17:46] ripprrooster: Yes
[4:17:46] Phoenix3215: Theyre all spammin SM Tho
[4:17:48] bigfatnerd1: but people just farm dungeons anyway
[4:17:48] lHlUlLlK: no
[4:17:48] TheRealHaggz: agree
[4:17:49] adam_brisbane: why dont htey just give the buff to people that have one already at 40
[4:17:50] McNerdSauce: killing the game with this.....
[4:17:50] dalvasorsali: why are people in such a hurry, even in games?
[4:17:50] lecorsairr: there is no experience with all those bots
[4:17:51] buckobean: ISS A RETAIL DIRECTION
[4:17:51] Villewk: its season of daddy not discovery
[4:17:51] rudisaurus: i am a warrior and no chance yet to Get a into a raid.. feels like i am playing alone bcuz nobody want warriors
[4:17:51] rithummm: So does sod lead into classic+? @Xaryu
[4:17:51] xfreedoooomx: well said
[4:17:51] McNerdSauce: pretty sad
[4:17:52] tisoap: the way is the goal @Xaryu
[4:17:52] jbeemerks: W
[4:17:52] themadfeltcher: Oh wow, that's an unexpected delight... I was wanting to level alts but it feels too slow
[4:17:53] epicninja808: Spam SM leveling xp lulw
[4:17:53] TClear: people are rushing either way
[4:17:53] tillluis: agree
[4:17:53] alecmaire: fair point
[4:17:54] Holtann: Why not enable it after you have at least 1 toon @ 40?
[4:17:55] themadfeltcher: Big W
[4:17:55] SmugJerry: SODCORE o7
[4:17:56] kkiati: people gonna make alts and stay neutral with pvp factions KKEW
[4:17:56] DrazaTraza: everyone just spams SM anyways
[4:17:56] firehook: will enjoy for myself but don't like the change for the game as a whole
[4:17:57] dimestime2: yeah i hit 40 last week on my paladin, got tired of the kiting so i started leveling an alt now so this change is good for me
[4:17:57] Mamba82: this makes questing a lot more viable later levels instead of everyone dungeon spamming like they did start of phase two
[4:17:57] ripintides: SOD leveling was more fun for me than max level, max level has nothing to do
[4:17:57] VVTfack: zar u have 1 char u dont level alt at all
[4:17:57] IrishMelody: It's not exactly bad but I don't think it's necessary at all
[4:17:57] lynxkorok: everyones always dungeon spamming anyway :/
[4:17:59] zol_zolli: I don't agree - I don't like leveling
[4:17:59] MisterPeace: i think its ok for alts, it was good to level to 40 on my first guy, but is  nightmare on my alts
[4:17:59] Leviosor: It already takes hours and hours to get 1 rune the lvl xp boost is great
[4:18:00] suppazz: I agree, but i just hate questing so damn much
[4:18:00] CIamzy: @key_321 crusader strike
[4:18:01] JROOOOOCCC: hey, now I can actually join a raid since I chose to lvl a rogue
[4:18:01] royas__: fair point :(
[4:18:02] surgento: everyone just spams dungeons anyway?
[4:18:03] TheButler_: As someone who started late, I'd like to level a little faster.
[4:18:05] solusxs: the next stuff is crazier
[4:18:08] curv6: mounts half the price KEKW
[4:18:09] spencerxburton: you can also disable xp buff with any innkeeper
[4:18:09] ClinxyWow: 100% xp buff isnt even that wild
[4:18:10] candy_fingers: no it does not make sense. respect though. most people dont like the leveling process
[4:18:11] epgkrispy: can you link url?
[4:18:12] ArkanisRP: 1 toon andys cryin
[4:18:12] richdawg: very retail like decision
[4:18:13] numblezzz: i dont really care YEP
[4:18:16] xgrumpygrampsx: Should be like DK's where u need a max lvl char to get the buff on alts
[4:18:17] handy_grenade: hell yeah i can make an alt now
[4:18:17] Tdoh__: this is a seasonal server, it shouldnt take as long as regular classic
[4:18:18] overlandingaggie: this is a seasonal thing, doesnt matter in the slighest
[4:18:18] Bolt_: They should've just made that buff for people who hit 40 on another character
[4:18:19] harl0tv: this makes me make another char
[4:18:20] TigbittiesXXL: nah man look at how many people are like "is it too late to start playing sod"
[4:18:20] trapt6rr: personally the leveling experience stops me from making more than one character simply cause of time, I just wanna play end game
[4:18:20] ThunderPokerDK: what do u use in ur hair?
[4:18:21] Ardal_Obe: you can turn it off if you don't want it
[4:18:21] AceOfFlame: people are  bitching about how BORING the lvling is for 25-40 and just want to hit 40 on them asap.
[4:18:22] voltrix07: @Xaryu most ppl r just spamming dungeos? lol
[4:18:22] duanew75: that means you could make another toon if you level that fast???
[4:18:23] serverfirst300003: cant wait for SF, SOD became a shitshow
[4:18:23] dariusbellpep: xar scroll down it gets worse @Xaryu
[4:18:23] BrokenClipsZ: @Xaryu it still takes some time i think its not to bad tbh
[4:18:24] LightBladeStream: Ruining the leveling to enable raiding is completely stupid. Vanilla was never about raiding and engame rushing
[4:18:24] illPopper: if you wanna level slowly you can disable the buff
[4:18:24] Finus: what's there to hate, you get more people in the max level pool
[4:18:26] auuzib: Finish mad season then? :D
[4:18:26] ellgthompson: hope i get a refund on my mount though lmao

[4:22:20] deepfriedbrainforlunch: we talk cm not inches right LUL
[4:22:20] chb1889: we should have 10 and 30 too
[4:22:23] frozzon: @xaryu that water bottle is huge
[4:22:24] Reaperz_kinetic: 20 is perfect imo 10 would have felt weird but 40 is kinda wild for SOD

[4:22:35] paulswaine123: why does no one understand they are making the leving speed just the normal classic speed now and not slower
[4:22:35] Seoken1: We will still get some 40 man raids in the future too, its just for the "core" raid next phase

[4:24:53] hotmanpop: gnomer is a feel good raid
[4:24:54] SilkeySmooth: they cant class balance so what do you think?
[4:24:55] lordsloths: should have a hardmode
[4:24:57] YzieGG: just bring the SOM MC it was good
[4:24:57] BootsTheAlpaca: @kirk_hunts I think instead of a refund you gotta go get a job my friend
[4:25:00] yourboycabrio: MC was a 20 man raid all along :P
[4:25:00] numblezzz: mc should be relatively easy with other raids getting harder
[4:25:00] xgrumpygrampsx: It requires a competent group
[4:25:01] Razzlee: gnomer is a lot of fun
[4:25:02] AceOfFlame: MC is easier then gnomer and BFD
[4:25:03] Dreckswaran: No, its way 2 easy
[4:25:03] carlosantonioar: Gnomer > BFD
[4:25:06] Ardal_Obe: start too hard and adjust down, if it starts too easy it's too hard to go back
[4:25:10] DeathToad007: just leave it as is. with sod gear 20 people could take down mc
[4:25:11] saltmachine92: cant you already 20 man mc with some gear
[4:25:12] sighwarlock: ya ur tellin them LOL
[4:25:12] t00spoonz: gnomer is a bit harder on horde because pallys can dispell magic
[4:25:16] jmaurice07: @kirk_hunts thats skill issue you should have way more gold than that if u actually did all the quests
[4:25:19] Diabolikkgg: all ppl want in vanilla raids is doing massive numbers and parsing no mechanics
[4:25:31] painkillab: BatChest BatChest BatChest BatChest BatChest BatChest BatChest BatChest
[4:25:33] brumstool: thoughts on a 15 man?
[4:25:53] Dranks699: They're making SoD retail

[4:26:12] Tdoh__: @Dranks699 nothing like it bud
[4:26:12] kanosuntale: if going forward they make 10 and 20 mans, it will beperfect, s they are divisible
[4:26:16] kirk_hunts: @jmaurice07 if I just did enough quests to get gold for my mounts why would I have more gold than that?
[4:26:17] dariusbellpep: windows 11 is good
[4:26:19] Zielepoot: so you'll be in tbc Ilvl gear while at 69
[4:26:20] Zielepoot: 60
[4:26:24] aho47: they should acces shaman and pala for both fractions

[4:26:45] MikeyMacaroni: I would like having one 40 raid that is chill and fun, then 20 raids for the more difficult encounters

[4:27:04] Napknutt: give me brd raid
[4:27:13] realandtruephobe: Not everything has to cater to me, I get that. But the easy leveling, free gold, and cheap mount changes will hold SoD back imo.
[4:27:13] jjuliiuz: as a casual i dont mind the 100% boost
[4:27:18] Udenwo: This post is getting my HYPED
[4:27:20] whitewrestler: big scale raids in FF14 are so easy and they get boring so fast
[4:27:27] cookie_jayy: CLASSIC + Pog
[4:27:31] bigfatnerd1: anxiety hahahaha, Gen Z in a nutshell
[4:27:31] dalvasorsali: 1. Remove gold from the game. 2. Remove need for repairs. 3. Make spell learning through questing, not coins. 4. Make ur own consumables (adjust drop rates to make it morr accessible). 5. No trading (self found). 6. Enjoy leveling, pvp and pve without the bots and money. @xaryu what do you think?
[4:27:33] Xspazz: they can ask the community to propse then itemiziation for next phases
[4:27:34] Genghish: There should be more classes faction locked imo it gives more identity to the faction
[4:27:35] numblezzz: ranked pvp modCheck

[4:29:01] McNerdSauce: 3 chars, purchased all - awesome!
[4:29:01] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: fuck em
[4:29:02] matt850h: mount money thing is so stupid
[4:29:05] themadfeltcher: I love my alts, but leveling 25-40 feels meh, so I find it a HUGE W
[4:29:06] krulfar: not a little you got fucked in the ass
[4:29:07] Karesz93: alt friendly changes
[4:29:08] Stingin: Who cares its just 45 gold
[4:29:08] enigmasvea: xp buff = huge W, can finally lvl alts
[4:29:08] Napknutt: I got my mount yesterday

[4:29:11] Odezq: @xaryu mount price cut half is bullshiey!!!! I paid 3x character 80g per for mount and riding???? So I ripped my gold??? FCK BLIZZ!!! !!!!
[4:29:11] Kasemox: I just bought mine today ;___; LOL
[4:29:12] wizbi_: alt thing is good, casual friendly. People still only spam SM until 40, this will just make it quicker
[4:29:14] Genghish: 3chars 0 mounts, W
[4:29:14] HilmKang: why increase the cost of mounts at the start of p2 to just decrease it again?
[4:29:16] pmanfit91: Same concept for those players who hit revered with Waylaid Supplies, though. We didn't get 12g per box. We got 2. Such is life.
[4:29:16] niicku97: i m kinda jealous of ur vegeta hairline
[4:29:17] SweatyDaniels: if they did already prchase a mount they probably have some alts and now they can get cheaper mount on their alts
[4:29:17] askinforit: Gold change is kinda an L tbh
[4:29:19] thebennieshow: for anyone with a job the xp changes are a W for sure.
[4:29:20] LightBladeStream: I'm fine with 50% xp boost 1-39 NOW but 100% is just a disaster
[4:29:20] Famewar: it was always meant to have an emphasis on alts so it all makes sense
[4:29:23] Kuda1000: SWEAT
[4:29:26] askinforit: inflation is gonna be very real lol
[4:29:27] ketchgg: hey chat and @Xaryu any advice on farming waylaid supply crates?
[4:29:29] Knaxxis: i kinda quit sod but ima still watch - retail is just more my style rn
[4:29:29] valyrie__: Are they going to refund gold if you bought one?
[4:29:31] dramajohns: soO SWEATY lol
[4:29:32] CologneLive: flop was legit one of the BEST rdruids NA/EU in slands ngl
[4:29:35] askinforit: @valyrie__ no lol
[4:29:41] numblezzz: need to 1v1 hydra
[4:29:41] themadfeltcher: I like keeping it slow for the first half, so you can play your main like Classic, now I can level alts instead of get bored and wait for next phase
[4:29:48] SweatyDaniels: another retail andy
[4:29:49] Grosmurdefeu: when i bought the 1000g dual spec when it came and then they lowered it to 100g i didnt get anny refund, if you think you are gonna get a refund for your mount skill keep dreaming
[4:29:59] TClear: people say leveling experience but there’s nothing left to really experience that’s why we’re in “classic plus”
[4:30:00] LightBladeStream: @thebennieshow how? Leveling is 90% of the game. It will make half the quests in the game a worthless waste of time
[4:30:08] lonesovl: when will blizz fix the mass report auto suspension
[4:30:09] druidnatorr: @xaryu lvl 60 raids will be 20 man LMAO L
[4:30:16] Knaxxis: @SweatyDaniels  why do ppl like u gfotta exist - U CAN ONLY PLAY ONE VERSION OF WOW or i dont like you lol  - its so fuckin cringe dude
[4:30:19] Mobely__: raptor bis
[4:30:22] realandtruephobe: WoW retail didn't get bad by not listening to the community. It got bad by giving everyone big time QoL features and buffs they asked for.

[4:32:15] SirNewblet: @Xaryu is flop the tettles of classic?
[4:32:20] Tdoh__: @AceOfFlame starsurge used to one shot lol
[4:32:21] Knaxxis: at 60 in sod i think the raids HAVE  to be 25 man
[4:32:22] mywukie: @ColePowerz thanks dude
[4:32:28] Knaxxis: 0 man will be tooi much

[4:33:16] StunningPaul: Question: When you say __ was "rank 1 druid" ... how does that work? Was it 1 rank 1 team per realm? Did you have to finish the season as rank 1? or just temporarily hit it to be called "rank 1"
[4:33:18] lukemeleney: the wand kill lol

[4:34:15] Plaguethong: @Xaryu it's easy to get gold in WoW in SoD by leveling up and doing quests, so why lowering it to 50g for mount is beyond stupid
[4:34:17] StunningPaul: Question: When you say __ was "rank 1 druid" ... how does that work? Was it 1 rank 1 team per realm? Did you have to finish the season as rank 1? or just temporarily hit it to be called "rank 1" ((someone in chat could answer me kindly also <3)
[4:34:18] Trav_Where: as a person that has never had 100g to my account in the game since the start i really like this change
[4:34:20] curv6: sunken temple raid would be cool too

[4:34:22] Twerkinrogue: you paid extra to have your mount early
[4:34:22] lion_the_ryan: what's so bad about the change? people with a lot of money shouldn't care and people with no money get benefit
[4:34:27] kirk_hunts: is it so hard for them to refund us? They did this to me when I pushed Honored with Wailaid in P1 on two characters and then the next day they lowered it to friendly. That was just hours of my life wasted.
[4:34:30] elendo: i dont understand the trouble, people bought salvages for 25g a week ago, now they are 1g

[5:30:19] zugmadonk: I hate 40 man raiding, too many people to organize
[5:30:19] Perkasetz: people just miss 40man
[5:30:22] Skyraiker: MC wouldve been 20 mand regardless with new runes and gear
[5:30:22] callexy95: FUCK 40 MAN
[5:30:22] curl3s: i like 40 man sadge
[5:30:23] Bolt_: LUL
[5:30:24] Sowiloo: it's ok
[5:30:24] Jonluke92: 20man max raids seems great
[5:30:24] batchestspam: @danielbanks living bomb and living flame is still most of his damage
[5:30:24] socom1211: i like big raid
[5:30:27] themadfeltcher: there's a lot of no change andys

[5:30:28] kenxxys: if you hate 40 man go play retail!
[5:30:28] grizz430: it gets lost in chat trying to explain it
[5:30:28] n3v3ts247: i would prefer the 40m MC
[5:30:29] Gosu_Rival: We need it, you cant go from 10 mans to 40 man raids; thinking it's going to work.
[5:30:30] raptorjesus300: 40 man raiding makes guilds important
[5:30:34] Kujiia: we're way past the "you think you do but u don't"
[5:30:35] BigbadKevin: @kenxxys yah but this isnt classic...
[5:30:36] ericdude92: cant sit there and do nothing in 40 man PepeLaugh
[5:30:36] YzieGG: 40 men is more epic then 20
[5:30:37] Bolt_: God everyone is such a baby
[5:30:37] gradugebloodfister: Hey Xar what class are you going to play in SSF? Mage or...?
[5:30:37] Sublux: i think if you hate that change, you've never tried to put together or keep a group of 40 people together in raids, you've only been a part of them
[5:30:38] Mobely__: ppl who dont want classic +
[5:30:38] PjxWoW: @raptorjesus300 pooiar scum
[5:30:39] morphis1792: 40 is fun and it feels epic
[5:30:39] nderalvarez: are u gonna check bengal tiger mount vendor while bloodmoon?
[5:30:41] mistahfrank: MC 20 was even normal to do in classic cause it was little more challenging? dont know why classic andy's are malding
[5:30:42] mageguy8: I did 40 man in classic never want to do that again elisBlep
[5:30:43] 156lean: i new to wow and im looking forward to it 20 man sounds insane
[5:30:44] pizac7: there are a ton of 10 man guilds. what are they supposed to merge with 3 other guilds? no way
[5:30:45] boomstick093: F 40 man
[5:30:45] Exusprime: wow classic players mad....NO WAY
[5:30:51] xfreedoooomx: 40 man is that classic experience
[5:30:53] kenxxys: @BigbadKevin YIKES comment
[5:30:57] IAmTehGuy: are they going to remove one to add the other?? I thought they would just have 2 versions of the raid
[5:30:58] teknison: They are just making MC 40 to transition from 10 man raids
[5:30:59] MrRaisin7: 40 man is so chaotic lmao
[5:30:59] sound_wayv: "manage" lol its MC
[5:31:00] Sublux: Also its JUST the first raid that is a 20 man
[5:31:01] Balmerick: the forever having to recruit 40 man raiding. Fuck that dude
[5:31:01] Trav_Where: i don't dislike it, but i've been having trouble keeping 10 and scheduling raids
[5:31:02] nides_: People that want 40 man have NEVER RL ever in their life 100% guaranted
[5:31:02] danielbanks: I can barely form 10 people let alone 40 lol
[5:31:03] themadfeltcher: current guild is struggling to get 2 10 man groups going... 40 man will be rough
[5:31:04] Jeremyspys: 40 man raider go back to era thanks
[5:31:05] FarmerCray: they should have 20 and 40 and 40 just gets double the loot
[5:31:07] coreflake1: 40 man is tedious
[5:31:08] Seronem0: SOD is extremely casual oriented, 40 man raids are not
[5:31:12] Koy_Boy: I personally am fine with 20 man, but I could see how their approach not involving any community members (OSRS system of voting to see) and brute forcing a MASSIVE raid change could be offputting
[5:31:14] sevent04: i like talking and hanging with my friends during raid but 40 people talking is too much
[5:31:15] DoWork75: 40 is way too many
[5:31:16] padierman: harder to foster real community in 40 mans, always some stinkers that ruin it
[5:31:18] morerpplisjeff: same
[5:31:22] kaizen421: 40 man just does not seem realistic unfortunately.
[5:31:22] kenxxys: accessible like retail
[5:31:24] Mikayyy: 20 is fine for sod imo
[5:31:25] mageguy8: elisEHEHE 20 man is cozy
[5:31:29] Sublux: I feel like if you read the entirety of that blue post, it's hard to think they are wrong in their decisions
[5:31:29] dana_danielle: 40 man on AU servers just.. would be impossible. Not enough people online at the same time
[5:31:30] Draznath: the hardest part of a 40 man raid is filling 40 people KEKW
[5:31:30] EFFSIN: Do u max CoC
[5:31:32] voidtouched_93: 40 man is horrible getting gear
[5:31:34] ComradeWarners: Did you see XP buff next week?

[5:31:39] oz__tv: are you gonna play war within ?
[5:31:45] coreflake1: it will be unplayable
[5:31:45] Shyxia: Can you still hit 360's?
[5:31:46] gradugebloodfister: What class in SSF?
[5:31:47] Relaxstraza: It's lagging lol
[5:31:47] xfreedoooomx: people afk in 40 also.
[5:31:49] grubols: 10 man raids don’t help guilds
[5:31:49] grizz430: accessibility in WoW historically means you can just steamroll content if you have a few braincells
[5:32:02] hickey7979: pre recorded 360
[5:32:08] Shyxia: Kreygasm
[5:32:09] sobakavolk: lagging event finaly
[5:32:12] oz__tv: youll gonna play war within ?
[5:32:13] EFFSIN: do u max CoC
[5:32:17] DirtyyFresh: can you hit a 1080?
[5:32:24] Saiauriel: Xar can you chug that glass of chocolate milk

[5:32:40] Seronem0: can you hit a 420° 420dmg fireblast?
[5:32:40] SneakyBeaverr: Listening
[5:32:44] Dhars: If you still haven't gotten to 40, how quickly would it take for someone to catch up?
[5:32:48] danielbanks: I saw in normal classic they just got every buff in the game and zerg a boss on 30sec. Lame
[5:32:53] behindyou28: SOD dead?
[5:32:54] CIamzy: No mercy for rogues
[5:32:54] boveylol: have you gotten skull yet?
[5:33:00] KosmicDevil_: hes insane
[5:33:20] Dhars: Sorry, I meant end-game stuff, getting your STV weapon, crafted gear & etc.
[5:33:20] Sublux: The reason they gave for changing raid sizes was that guilds and communities setting up around 10 man groups, making swapping to 40 mans a lot more difficult/problematic situations super bad, like Guild leader Ego v guild leader ego - At least giving people the stepping stone in between 10 and 40 man seems good
[5:33:26] Kuda1000: TRUE
[5:33:30] kenxxys: LISTENING TO FEEDBACK GET YOU RETAIL
[5:33:30] themadfeltcher: retail is the "make everyone happy"

[5:33:36] 2drunk4this: this is retail dawg
[5:33:37] Bolt_: Sometimes you just gotta serve up the wah burger and french cries
[5:33:37] pmanfit91: You think they increased the XP bonus because people were now buying Gold to pay for level boosts? Eliminating that, maybe?
[5:33:38] BufuGear: just like politics KEKW
[5:33:40] hotmanpop: YEP
[5:33:42] Brogananda: JUST DO IT attitude

[5:33:47] xxvampxx: KEKW
[5:33:47] Tsuness: I would agree if the game wasnt going to be gone in a year
[5:33:50] nides_: But SOD is about accessibility !

[6:05:03] Sglit: can u show ur talents
[6:05:07] Ayomeer: melee was playable at the start where there were smaller fights. Now that everyone realizes where the good spots are and to fight near boss, the fights are too big to be effective on melee
[6:05:11] lion_the_ryan: heals gone wild
[6:05:14] Disidon: @teknison like wintergrasp

[6:09:34] MrDeedslive: ez kills
[6:09:37] MonkeyOverlord: being in a bad group with people trickling into enemies is equal to being solo
[6:09:43] teknison: I think the idea of the event was to include solo play as well as group play
[6:09:43] mackearns: do you think since there are so many people it could be better with still being faction split?
[6:09:45] remler_: @Vandracon true
[6:09:45] Melkor_Active: @xaryu is this an addon or weakaura which shows u the proccs?
[6:09:47] Rawz1337: @Ayomeer Not everyone gets a invite

[6:42:10] Ayomeer: @NotASkiller I can understand that argument in retail or even other classic versions but if you skip leveling in sod you got 1 easy raid for your endgame.
[6:42:12] king___slender: They opened the 20 man box and they wont be able to close it now
[6:42:16] nunupagadii: do you think blizzard will add arena to sod ?
