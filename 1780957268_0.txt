[1:21:21] Hyelander_: New Tab Targetting is adjusted to be more "inclusive" Kappa
[1:21:24] eltonazevedobounty: @Capnrein go to options target and then you will see TAB button into target nearest enemy, you need to chose target nearest enemy (player)
[1:22:13] eltonazevedobounty: @Swifty  go to options target and then you will see TAB button into target nearest enemy, you need to chose target nearest enemy (player)
[1:23:38] JoeTheBoss: u need to select target nearest enemy with tab
[1:23:50] JoeTheBoss: thats stops it from just targeting any random enemy
