[5:04:16] Tabrill: the bike is bis. I legit sit on my phone and just sweat away. its the easiest shit
[5:04:25] nastywafflesxxx: Shannon: In the heart of the forest, where the trees stood tall and proud, a small stream meandered its way through the undergrowth. The water glistened in the dappled sunlight, and the sound of its gentle babbling filled the air with a soothing melody. Birds chirped and flitted among the branches, their colorful plumage a striking contrast against the verdant foliage. It was a scene of serene beauty, untouched by the hustle and bustle of the outside world.
[5:04:28] BingoTingler: 1 hour on the treadmill is really long for first day
[5:04:39] StreamElements: Follow my socials @Beantwitch on twitter/instagram/youtube
