[1:38:44] JohnnysHappyHideout: @AdeptStrain Same!
[1:38:44] AdeptStrain: Lots of whiteboard code too
[1:38:51] lordcdm: @AdeptStrain Madge Pseudocode
[1:38:56] DigitalVortex92: Whiteboard code, as long as its psuedo code is ok
[1:39:04] DigitalVortex92: WalterVibe
[1:39:05] JorgeMGon: @AdeptStrain real code
[1:39:17] Superbaas88: if I remember, gnommer doesn't have especially great caster loot
[1:39:22] AdeptStrain: Coding interviews it has to be real code on the white board DigitalVortex92
[1:39:28] DigitalVortex92: But why
[1:39:30] theocrattt: yup all my programming exams in college were made on paper
[1:39:31] Goldni007: gnomer where u go to die
[1:39:34] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: If we start dying then I'm vanishing
[1:39:38] Draleric: SCATTER
[1:39:44] DigitalVortex92: Literally no one needs to know code that well
[1:39:45] Superbaas88: Gnomer unironically be where most people go to die
[1:40:09] AdeptStrain: Because you're looking for details and good common practices in an interview
[1:40:20] AdeptStrain: Null pointer checks, out of bounds checks, etc.
[1:40:22] Goldni007: its cause like that tram area that has 2 levels and someone always aggros the other level of mobs
[1:40:34] DigitalVortex92: @AdeptStrain You can do that in coding checks online... with an IDE that gives you documentation
[1:40:49] AdeptStrain: Yea, what if you don't have access to that?
[1:40:51] Superbaas88: yeah, the final cooridor in Gnommer is a hard pass. I don't care if I'm on a rogue and they have 18 agility pants
[1:41:04] HessianX: HessianX subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 23 month streak! I heard you like 69 subs
[1:41:05] NeroTNC: Hey cobalt
[1:41:06] Superbaas88: Horde can get the same quest for the 18 agility pants btw.
[1:41:10] DigitalVortex92: @AdeptStrain In what world would you be programming something without documentation to basic coding features
[1:41:10] Dinth1: i've run gnomer legit like 3 times in the 20 years i've played wow
[1:41:12] Dinth1: awful dungeonm
[1:41:14] stoney_entertainment: cobaltDance
[1:41:18] andrewlol69: mfer im saved to gnomer we doing it tomooro
[1:41:20] lord_settite: RFD is so much scarier than Gnomer.
[1:41:22] AdeptStrain: I've been on teams where we write the compiler and STL libraries for some embedded platform. LuL
[1:41:27] Goldni007: gnomer is just like a pain to get to
[1:41:45] Superbaas88: BFD is also where you farm if you want to pimp out your caster
[1:41:53] lord_settite: Razorfen Downs can be brutal
[1:41:58] DigitalVortex92: Seems to me like you'd still look things up for relevant knowledge, even if its not direct
[1:41:58] casualhertz: But horde can get to gnomer from stranglethorn vale via teleporter
[1:42:25] Superbaas88: also on Horde, Thermaplug drops both a REALLY good ring, and an absolutely nutty 2 handed axe.
[1:42:30] PaperbackWritter: KEKW
[1:42:33] potatoes778: D: toxic
[1:42:34] Goldni007: u still gotta run thu the whole area and die to the elevator boss
[1:42:50] metswrulez: Hi Colbalt :)
[1:43:05] DigitalVortex92: either way, i just disagree with giving people tests that don't allow them access to relevant documentation unless it's explicitly mentions that what you're doing is without documentation
[1:43:13] DigitalVortex92: It's like math tests without calculators
[1:43:15] AdeptStrain: Sure, you can. But another part of the coding interview is how are you at problem solving? Like, a simple string reversal. I've had people with many years not know how a string reverse works under the hood. They just use a library for it.
[1:43:35] DigitalVortex92: Why would you need to know though at a high level
[1:44:05] AdeptStrain: Because, at least in my field, I want to know you know what the code is doing, how the memory is laid out, what is the cache behaviors, etc.
[1:44:05] DigitalVortex92: Use the library that's tried and true. don't reinvent the wheel. and in places where you have to, sure, i guess i can understand that, but why not allow an IDE or at least a computer to type it.
[1:44:38] xxmatosxx1: @AdeptStrain you are working in something like a deep backend?
[1:44:51] DigitalVortex92: Writing code down on pen and paper is just useless nowadays. You can't run code without a computer
[1:45:02] DigitalVortex92: we aren't usin' punchcards out here
[1:45:16] DigitalVortex92: even if its just notepad, that's more realistic
[1:45:19] AdeptStrain: xxmatosxx1 I work mainly on video games and all the tools and platforms to support them. So, like I said, a lot of low level embedded stuff. I've written more memory allocators than I can think of.
[1:45:42] DigitalVortex92: well, sorry for going on a rant, it just bothered me growing up
[1:45:46] Superbaas88: at least your other stats are solid
[1:45:49] DigitalVortex92: ill move on now lol
[1:45:55] AdeptStrain: Yea, I get it. DigitalVortex92 It's all good man.
[1:45:56] xxmatosxx1: @DigitalVortex92 i had an entire class where the only tests were in paper and where no projects so we had to know how to do everything in paper. This was in 2021
[1:45:58] bigorange48: Psuedo code I’ll write on whiteboard or pen/paper but actual code? NTY
[1:46:03] fraghil: Alliance tattoo when ?
[1:46:10] preauxton: i enjoyed this coding discussion tangent
[1:46:19] IrishLarry: i was enjoying that discussion in chat :)
[1:46:23] DigitalVortex92: @bigorange48 The AP exam in 2013 for AP Comp Sci was in pen/paper only LUL
[1:46:27] causticgoose: @DigitalVortex92 it's just harder to control the environment and prevent cheating than pen and paper, also a bit slower getting it all set up rather than just having it printed
[1:46:45] lord_settite: @DigitalVortex92 Knowledge of concepts of coding and structure will tell a lot. There are far too many tools and easy ways out with automation and AI to skirt past. A good developer should or will go beyond that.
[1:46:48] causticgoose: @DigitalVortex92 AP cs exams are computerized now
[1:46:54] otteroil: Generally speaking, testing shows understanding of the the subject. I the real world this translates to efficiency, it is quicker/cheaper to complete a task by someone that understands the problem opposed to a person that has to research it.
[1:46:55] PrepotenEU: LUL this floor
[1:46:57] DigitalVortex92: @causticgoose I mean, literally if you're gonna have ppl pen and paper it in an office for an interview, just give em microsoft notepad and watch them test LUL
[1:46:58] bigorange48: @digitalvortex92 I’m self taught so I didn’t do any formal classes outside of things my work has now paid for
[1:47:27] DigitalVortex92: @lord_settite You don't need pen/paper exams to prove proficiency
[1:47:31] causticgoose: @DigitalVortex92 i meant moreso for my in class exams in college,
[1:47:39] potatoes778: donochan PepeHands
[1:47:40] DigitalVortex92: @causticgoose That's good to hear at least LUL
[1:47:41] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: I had a circuitry class where the midterm was 40% of your grade and your final was 40% and they were graded 40/40. The project was the last 20%
[1:48:07] Luciferocious_: matchbook incoming! I feel it
[1:48:07] DigitalVortex92: That's how my project management class was @RedBumperCar that's a pretty common class structure i'd say nowadays, at least where i went to school
[1:48:33] xxmatosxx1: @AdeptStrain Thanks for sharing! Had never thought about that part of game development
[1:48:39] Why_is_Barb_Yelling: @digitalvortex92 it's brutal. Miss 1 point and it's a point off your entire grade
[1:48:50] AdeptStrain: xxmatosxx1 Yea, each new console is basically it's own environment and has it's own special tools.
[1:48:57] thelastradish: cobaltHMM

[1:49:59] preauxton: LUL
[1:50:07] lord_settite: @DigitalVortex92 I do come from a different side though. I was a military cryptologist and the start of our training and a lot after it was hand written. It is because it is normally a lot easier to pick up patterns or mistakes when your brain is manually processing it.
[1:50:08] notfeed4you: not again

[1:50:48] AdeptStrain: A bunch of common interview questions I've had/given are: Write a binary search algorithm, write a function to determine if a point is within a triangle, string reversal. All on a whiteboard. LuL
[1:50:57] kebabthief: steals kebabs
[1:51:02] D3MP0_96: Inb4 super greed
[1:51:09] xxmatosxx1: @AdeptStrain PC gaming is easier then? The tools change less?
[1:51:10] causticgoose: there's some non-stimulant adhd meds that are getting fairly common @CobaltStreak
[1:51:15] bigorange48: I love my learning meth
[1:51:26] AdeptStrain: xxmatosxx1 PC gaming is the WORST. The hardware varies wildly.
[1:51:29] notfeed4you: ngl, ive found i perform worse in video games overall when im properly medicated
[1:51:56] tigerex72: cobaltHi cobaltHi
[1:52:00] K9kroz: laser focus
[1:52:10] Shadewfire: @AdeptStrain Do expect pseudo-code for that or in a specific language?

[1:52:41] xxmatosxx1: weren't some fortnite player caught taking aderall to play better in tournaments?
[1:52:50] lord_settite: SSRI fuck me hard when I want to dig deep into games especially an RPG.
[1:52:55] AdeptStrain: Shadewfire For the Binary search and string reversal - mostly correct code (I don't care about syntax). For the point in triangle, pseudo is fine.
[1:53:34] AdeptStrain: And all the companies I've worked for/at have been majority C/C++ companies (99%).
[1:53:40] lord_settite: @AdeptStrain It is more about the though process and analytical mind.
[1:53:48] lord_settite: thought
[1:54:01] AdeptStrain: lord_settite That's a big part of it. I encourage people to talk as they write.

[1:54:28] Khirgil: Given some of the plays you make in this game, I just assumed you did.
[1:54:29] kebabthief: wish i had bigger balls cobaltstreak 2023
[1:54:30] xxmatosxx1: @AdeptStrain So when everyone celebrates that there is a new graphics card you cry a bit inside because it is a bunch of new work
[1:54:39] garn32: for the programmers I oversee I do like pair programing
[1:54:54] AdeptStrain: xxmatosxx1 I cry when DirectX or Vulcan make new specs, or yea, SLI / RTX...

[1:56:14] AlienWhale: I wish I enjoyed watching WoW as much as I enjoyed watching Isaac D:
[1:56:16] AdeptStrain: In a junior candidate I generally look for: Do they have some knowledge of how their code works with the hardware, and some good programming practices. How is the problem solving skills? And most importantly - are they an asshole / not a team player? LuL I can teach you almost anything, but I can teach you not to be an asshole.
[1:56:16] Careless94: in 2 days is blizzcon

[1:57:36] lord_settite: @AdeptStrain Everything breaks down to math... The true universal language. It is really how you can break down and understand or create new things.
[1:57:37] kebabthief: need more Joel

[1:58:41] AdeptStrain: 1st kidnapping doesn't count. It's just for practice.
[1:58:43] causticgoose: rounding down that's like 0 times a decade
[1:58:58] Stinkinburrows: that also means he was let go twice tho so thats good
[1:58:59] Shadewfire: @lord_settite Math is great until you have to start proving it exists Joel

[2:02:09] xxmatosxx1: oh no
[2:02:15] kebabthief: Adge
[2:02:24] JohnnysHappyHideout: @AdeptStrain Once I read something along the lines of "math is the code in which the universe is written" or "math is the language we use to describe reality".
[2:02:26] AdeptStrain: lord_hypnos_ Nice! Cryptology is crazy to me.
[2:02:36] xxmatosxx1: Dodge d the Adge
[2:02:38] chill3willy: jesus how many greeds is that
[2:02:39] AdeptStrain: JohnnysHappyHideout Yea, I tend to agree with that.
[2:02:53] JohnnysHappyHideout: Yeah.
[2:02:58] Gingembrownie: @JohnnysHappyHideout Which are two very different statements, right ?
[2:03:21] preauxton: i think the first one is just a more romantic way to say the 2nd one
[2:03:47] JohnnysHappyHideout: @Gingembrownie Oh yeah, they're different (imo).
[2:03:48] kc5803: They're similar, no doubt.
[2:04:03] Gingembrownie: @preauxton I think that the first one assumes that maths is something underlying reality, while the second simply states that's our best tool to describe the reality
[2:04:10] kc5803: Yeah.
[2:04:11] causticgoose: @lord_settite graduate cryptography is by far the hardest class i've ever taken, i can't imagine writing crypto proofs all day
[2:04:16] IrishLarry: im kinda scared of this run
[2:04:18] Gingembrownie: I think I tend to stand more by the second than the first
[2:04:32] Shadewfire: @JohnnysHappyHideout I would revise it to math is the syntax and things like physics, chemistry, etc is code
[2:05:01] JohnnysHappyHideout: @Gingembrownie First one would be saying we know for a fact that math is the key to reality whereas the second one is saying we created a tool to describe how it works ("translation" maybe?)
[2:05:14] AdeptStrain: Chemistry is just organic math to me.
[2:05:22] Gingembrownie: @JohnnysHappyHideout Yeah I agree
[2:05:30] AdeptStrain: Physics is universal math
[2:05:30] JohnnysHappyHideout: Yeah.
[2:05:50] preauxton: cobalt care to chime in on the chat convo Kappa
[2:05:52] kc5803: @Gingembrownie Yeah, I think math is more just a description we use, rather than the REASON everything works.

[2:06:15] Shadewfire: @Shadewfire I'd also say it's just semantics at some point, but that's what Mathematicians thrive on LUL
[2:06:15] AdeptStrain: I'm terrified that the average math level in the US (atleast) is 6th grade. Which isn't even up to basic algorithms and proportions / fractions.
[2:06:35] preauxton: @Gingembrownie most definitely. any mathematician/scientist knows that math is just our approximations for how the universe works. 1st one just sounds more fun to say lol
[2:06:47] JohnnysHappyHideout: @Gingembrownie You could also say that the first is saying math existed before we invented it and we discovered it and the second one is saying we invented it to describe what we discovered weSmart
[2:06:49] onlinerxoxo: what is the mod for the brimstone charge indicator?

[2:08:02] Gingembrownie: @Gingembrownie Yeah but it's an interesting philosophical question, right ? Is there "some code" underlying reality that makes it so that it is understandable in the first place :) Just like what @JohnnysHappyHideout is saying, which has been a question since Plato !
