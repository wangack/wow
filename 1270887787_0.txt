[1:52:04] Ivarjaws: @Towelliee Sup towel, how you goin brother, any more mounts ?
[1:52:05] snackbacon: maybe they're announcing a new mount for sale in the blizz store
[1:52:06] XerciusGaming: I'd be surprised if it's 10.0 because it could potentially spoil stories at the end of 9.2
[1:52:36] d1stract10n: d1stract10n subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 69 months! towLets towGo best number
[1:52:39] klindatu: Yes it was. Ions joke about the datamining on stage about N'Zoth
[1:52:43] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: Personally I am curious how they are going to fix the lore
[1:52:44] Kindosar: could you quickly review getting legion class mounts?
[1:52:49] Sielu11628: Both BFA and SL were announced before the last raid tier came out for Legion and BFA. However, the way the story is tied in SL, who knows
[1:52:50] CardinalTX: We are getting a crossover. When SWtOR expansions launches the empire will be attacking Azeroth
[1:52:57] cabalish: towHAMUP nice
[1:53:07] CushyPop: agreed
[1:53:44] Rudric_Ice: BFA cinematic was pretty linear
[1:53:50] Armdel: alliance and horde probably wouldn't be fighting if the legion were still hardcore invading azeroth
[1:54:09] BardtheBowman: That’s an assumption though
[1:54:10] TiredCarcass: how a a trailer show the end of the maw
[1:54:44] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: The 10.0 trailer could simply just show things how they are outside SL at the moment. Turalyon stuff, for example. Hype us up for getting back out, kinda thing.
[1:54:53] mmrghost7: HE KNOWS
[1:54:57] snackbacon: lol
[1:54:59] atamala: 'while you've been gone...'
[1:55:20] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @Atamala yeah exactly
[1:55:28] Shrandamar: we might get a an announcement of the announcment :P so a date for the reveal
[1:55:31] ashwing_: If they pop out D4 aplha they might get a lot of hype
[1:56:01] JStevenson: Any prediction on the Limit announcement today?  Max said it was gonna be sometime this morning
[1:56:17] Heero_Effect: What’s a limit and a max?
[1:56:22] TheCliffyShow: Blizzard: I know we just got outted as a bunch of sexist, racist, perverts; but here's some mobile games.
[1:56:26] Dred_Scythe: @Towelliee D4 Alpha is sooooooooooo far off.
[1:56:28] BoezIRL: i think it's too soon for d4
[1:56:45] cabalish: ion ? do you love qwik ? IonJam
[1:56:53] swordart_19: I will play immortal for pvp
[1:56:59] Silverwards: i'd love a big budget Warcraft single player RPG
[1:57:02] Silverwards: but it'll never happen
[1:57:18] ashwing_: They are trying to make D4 more MMO like from what it seems
[1:57:47] Heero_Effect: Bet D4 is more like lost ark haha
[1:58:44] TheCliffyShow: I still can't get over Betty White dying so close to her 100th birthday.
[1:58:47] BardtheBowman: D4 raid could be a really cool idea but prolly not in the cards
[1:58:51] laggkillz: His name is Robert Paulson....rip Meatloaf.
[1:59:27] Screamnsteam: catJAM
[1:59:46] jacooners: are you going gunlancer for LA?
[1:59:51] rivera9: guldan green mount is noraml/heroic and mythic
[2:00:20] BardtheBowman: I got the little gulden mount.  Still need the rarer one
[2:00:30] klindatu: Gul'dan mythic fight still takes so long, imo.
[2:00:36] Aquadriel: i should farm the doggos mount from Argus, pretty ez as its 2nd boss
[2:00:41] at1c: I had look on my mount collection and its very sad sight.
[2:00:43] rivera9: sorry didnt hear the  " + " myB

[2:01:57] Alexkayzz: When u think about it, u have the same odds to get it thsi next kill, as you had the 1st time u tried it
[2:02:33] orbiitz269: I did one run of ToS in legion and got that abyss worm.  I don't even understand how
[2:03:21] Korupcija_: man, legion was so good
[2:03:57] GermanBacon: seems kinda boring to me
[2:03:58] Aquadriel: looks a bit meh
[2:04:05] cknation23: is there an addon for mount tracking
[2:04:08] h00rayforstuff: looks interesting
[2:04:09] swordart_19: Should buff some powers
[2:04:17] Aquadriel: Yep CDR seems useless compared to haste
[2:04:46] dyslexican1: I mean when any thing is the clear and obvious choice EVERY time its bad design.
[2:04:59] Aquadriel: I agree with Dratnos, CDR should be changed to a defensive one, maybe a BIG absorv
[2:04:59] h00rayforstuff: yeah
[2:05:11] Kisswani: Yo dawg , we heard you like haste
[2:05:30] BardtheBowman: Yea but players will iterate over and over to find the smallest advantage and expose the meta “best” choice
[2:05:30] cabalish: it does not stack, but runs in parallel

[2:20:53] Ldysansa: Mount sub event. Would be kinda cool. Don't know how that would work. But it could be something.
[2:20:58] kashmara: when is subathon
[2:21:02] BardtheBowman: Difficulty varies by expansion.  Some you get one shot.  Others you get to try each difficulty
[2:21:07] joontet: Has he set a date for the subathon yet?

[2:22:40] cabalish: march 1st
[2:22:54] Theduskflyer: These raids are still too fucking hard for “Legacy” Raids
[2:22:56] joontet: @RalgorStreams You can farm each one if the mount drop is not bound to a difficulty like mythic etc.
[2:23:07] Theduskflyer: Eerrr not hard, just long
[2:23:14] kashmara: oh my
[2:23:29] nc716: what time is evil andy at?

[2:35:20] ClipCraft: this is the kill!
[2:36:00] Onefishone: Your OLine and Taylor are beastly.  Have to win with that formula. I agree with the 2 WR's.  You think Wentz can do it?

[2:37:05] NiteshadezTV: @Towelliee which tank is most fun, personally, for you, in this stage of WoW?
[2:37:21] azzurrin: Draft Garret Wilson or Chris Olave

[2:40:42] Onefishone: You only have a certain amount of time or money with Q and the boys on the Line.  Best in the NFL hands down.  Colts have to make that one or two moves.
[2:40:50] smashwow: @h00rayforstuff only after they get the 4 set and double lego

[2:43:05] NiteshadezTV: @Volly 2023 for sure
[2:43:25] dyslexican1: @Towelliee You know what I think would be dope? If they got rid of the current Lego system, and let us farm up old raid gear, and have a system for us to upgrade it to Legos. And let us pick what we want to use.

[2:59:32] DoraK_GoB: Cowboys are in a IMPOSSIBLE position right now - like there is almost NOTHING they can do or add to that team to get them a superbowl - Cowboys had NO excuses other than they didn't try or play hard enough
[2:59:55] manmower: Cowboys can recruit Bobby as the head coach, see how he runs an org
[3:00:04] BlooGaymer: I mean i run raids on multiple alts every week... i can still make like 50-100k with all my alts but itr rough to do everyweek... (Im also on an rp server so AH the mog)

[3:01:24] Ziddrax: so g fuel is just an energy drink?
[3:01:27] Onefishone: MS didn't buy WoW to mess it up. They want their names on an actual successful MMO.
[3:01:43] Wildside1177: @manmower Turn it into woke nonsense like The Eternals....lol
[3:02:10] Korupcija_: W H OMEGALUL

[3:04:15] TakeThatBack: Sony is just scared of cod going Xbox only and stuff
[3:04:22] Ldysansa: They are not
[3:04:29] Ldysansa: Where was that reported
[3:04:30] swervity82: because xbox now would own some sony exclusive games
[3:04:32] TakeThatBack: Which consoles should die out anyway, pcmasterrace#
[3:04:33] AureliusXV: THEY ALKREADY SIAD COD ISNT GOING EXCLUSIVE
[3:04:35] Screamnsteam: sony fighting the sale with their shekel funding KEKW
[3:04:35] kokochris: Sony has no grounds
[3:04:38] JackHealMe: Look at spencers
[3:04:39] h00rayforstuff: They wouldn't announce it if they didn't have all the major terms figured out. only small nits and regulatory approval are what's left.
[3:04:41] PracTlKaL: Maybe the could be the innovators and go fullx plat
[3:04:57] manmower: the next Call of Duty setting is pretty easy to guess
[3:05:01] JackHealMe: Latest tweets, he was in a meeting with Sony to protect current agreements

[3:05:25] Aquadriel: microsoft has put many xbox/pc "exclusives" on the switch, so wouldnt be the first time.
[3:05:30] JackHealMe: Plus Xbox are the ones who want cross play and Sony have said no for the past 10 years
[3:05:31] Kisswani: Actually it wasn't a senator , a representative : Jerry Nadler who said it'll be scrutinzied . https://twitter.com/RepJerryNadler/status/1484232680397053956
[3:05:32] Okri24: Its the same as the done with Minecraft, every Switch and Ps sale of Minecraft is all money in Microsofts bank, same will happen with all CoD games
[3:05:32] T0MMYT: Pepehand
[3:05:34] TheCliffyShow: @Towelliee I'm standing front of Warbringer if you got any character there.
[3:05:44] zuru35: Literally the ONLY thing Sony has said was that its still business as usual with Blizzard ACT
[3:05:46] newkingcody: Pepehand
[3:05:47] HaxzorJimDuggan: it will just be a better deal with gamepass but yeah its so easy to just keep releasing on PS for that little bit extra.
[3:05:52] kokochris: Deal is gonna go through. its a legit purchase
[3:06:23] manmower: best skins

[3:06:45] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:06:45] Ldysansa: Don't go an cry. Do your Stuart Smalley's Affirmation lolo
[3:07:13] zuru35: Anyone who thinks the sale will be stopped dosent fully understand business and legal, MS would never announce a deal as big as this without one consulting their legal team and the government first
[3:07:15] Ldysansa: Stuart is from Saturday Night Live (Back in the day)
[3:07:15] Yagr6: u dont spend 80 b to let things stay the same

[3:56:04] Molvonos: I played the RTS games and still dont understand people's boners for Arthas.
[3:56:12] Aervyper: @Towelliee as bad as Cata was and the raids we're horrible the world foundation that Cata did still is amazing
[3:56:21] BoezIRL: i started in wrath so maybe i'm bias
[3:56:22] MeisterPetze: me2
[3:56:22] Jango_: MoP is a severely underrated expansion in general
[3:56:23] Hayon5: ''Asmongold react Towelliee ranking expansion ''
[3:56:24] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  Arthas son ofg Terenas Menethil II Kappa
[3:56:25] Planet_of_the_Apez: I havnt played since WOTLK. Is Wintergrasp still a thing?
[3:56:32] WhiteKnight74648: Are you comparing Arthas to a caller asking about your car extended warranty ? Kappy
[3:56:34] TheHoboWithAShotgun: BFA shouldve been PvP focused and have everything focus on alliance vs horde  in story
[3:56:36] WhiteKnight74648: Kappa
[3:56:37] Nomolock: I loved mop
[3:56:39] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee i thought legion was yr most played
[3:56:42] tomato26: Dung Finder or No Dung finder @Towelliee ?
[3:56:43] Plague_Wall: End of BfA was great
[3:57:06] Everbliss: I never thought BfA was as bad as most people say. Between SL and BfA there is no contest to me
[3:57:06] cosmothug: @Molvonos it's just epic seeing characters from warcraft rts in the mmo
[3:57:07] Keyastaron_: imo the most  i miss is the AP systems
[3:57:10] Gingerprimer: Yeha 8.2 saved BFA IMO witth essences
[3:57:10] Keyastaron_: to grow in power
[3:57:12] syla90: essences was a great idea on paper imo

[3:57:26] bgriff87: Best expansions TBC MoP Legion never played wrath quit the game too busy with college
[3:57:28] Plague_Wall: Neck rework and corruption vendor fixed BfA
[3:57:37] Topshizzle: spew
[3:57:40] Jango_: yeah it was good
[3:57:42] Keyastaron_: did the essences affect the TD ?
[3:57:43] Everbliss: MoP might bee my favorite
[3:57:43] unresolved_broccoli: meh
[3:57:45] Hayon5: 8.3 Prot warrior full twilight :)
[3:57:45] flebbooo: Having over 50% base crit Kreygasm
[3:57:46] Molvonos: @cosmothug I guess?  It was kind of expected given they're in the same universe and all that.  Were people 'shocked' at the idea?
[3:57:51] varrdragon: twilight dev was the tits
[3:57:51] MeisterPetze: 130% crit with arms
[3:57:55] Porcos_Voadores: once shadowlands is done, i'm not coming back to the maw NEVER again. thanks.
[3:57:55] BardtheBowman: That was good
[3:58:00] Bigmann109: BFA was great to start another toon and it didnt take alot to farm gear
[3:58:04] unresolved_broccoli: Wrath was more funimo
[3:58:07] Keyastaron_: 60 % Kreygasm
[3:58:07] Sloot: Yeah but they probably at last have the Ssazine mount
[3:58:08] Hayon5: That system was good , differents builds for differents content
[3:58:10] Mecabeast: i liked the min max of corrupption
[3:58:12] Gingerprimer: Yeah my only big problem with BFA was eesences not being BOA and Corruption vendor on a rotation
[3:58:18] jerexify: Man I miss TD... D:
[3:58:22] syla90: @Towelliee essences were their best idea so far imo.. but the acquisition was a mess
[3:58:22] Zippaya: I didnt liked SL from start, even when huuuge hype was than
[3:58:26] Scarhearth: I loved twilight but my favorite was full versatility and 2x ineffable truth on my warrior
[3:58:30] overhatched: Does anyone know what type of shelves @Towelliee has behind him? Also, Sup everyone!
[3:58:31] Redpandalol: The gushie set

[3:59:11] Jango_: torghast is more fun imo
[3:59:13] Alexkayzz: Shoulders LUL
[3:59:15] death_cam_: wish they did a similar thing with torghast where you can make it harder on purpose like the masks in visions
[3:59:17] dimofodi: Visions were fun at first but they needed more abilities to mix it up and more locations
[3:59:17] snackbacon: Visions are much better than Torghast, that's for sure

[4:29:22] Templexx: do ppl actively unsub on utube for stuff like that ? lol
[4:29:26] cappei: TBC still your favourite?
[4:29:30] Jamalamadingdong: ah shit, here we go again...
[4:29:35] Teomanm: do u guys think wow will come to game pass ?

[4:30:26] cappei: My hot take is that I'd rather play WoD than BFA/Shadowlands. At least classes played/felt good instead of dogshit
[4:30:36] 3663Sharad: A foreshadowing
[4:30:45] dan_monk: Mr.Streamer triggers youtube by stating SL is S tier
[4:30:47] Innerv8: sup big dawg how u doin man
[4:30:53] the_tavern_dwarf: Today is my birthday @towelliee 🎉🎊🎉
[4:31:23] kandor01: wrath is d tier imo, so boring
[4:31:31] Caloz7: spolit
[4:31:32] DeanoTV: @Cappaie WOD had actual 0 content for casuals
[4:31:37] Jamalamadingdong: 'you won't BELIEVE what he said about wrath'
[4:31:38] manmower: legion top 10 xpacs
[4:31:43] Volkien: Why wouldn't MS put ESO on the Blizz Launcher? it will increase subs, one sub to play both games. Makes capitalistic sense

[4:31:57] HaxzorJimDuggan: i have zero interest in playing wotlk again i was pretty hardcore back then and completed everything i wanted
[4:32:07] Jamalamadingdong: lol what
[4:32:16] Jamalamadingdong: what are people smoking today
[4:32:16] EscapePlan01: why cant people work that out lol
[4:32:21] Nico_vdM: ESO has its own launcher
[4:32:30] Wilfrandy1: KEKW
[4:32:32] Malarky33: What
[4:32:33] ashwing_: LUL?
[4:32:36] Joneeeez: and no eso isnt as famous as wow, and its a fraction compared to wows playerbase
[4:32:38] Templexx: that guy doesnt business
[4:32:40] gidgeet: There is a sub option
[4:32:48] jkitchin75: drugs are bad kids
[4:32:50] gidgeet: And it's worth it lol
[4:32:53] bgriff87: Mark my words there will be a more expensive Game Pass tier that will include MMO subscriptions
[4:32:58] AinaTan3: Business genius right there KEKW
[4:33:02] manmower: with Microsoft at the helm, does that raise odds of Blizzard NFTs?
[4:33:09] Volkien: See now @Towelliee you are thinking logically, thinking money wise. Eso players will sub to Blizz to play wow and make ESo more money
[4:33:12] gidgeet: Extra bag space and stuff like that
[4:33:14] grindtime23: its optional but it really isn't at the same time unless you want to run to the vendor every 5 min
[4:33:16] jeffnsteff2019: sub is optional if but diehards over there its a must
[4:33:36] dranet11: just shut eso down anyway its dead af
[4:33:41] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Even Rift sub?
[4:33:43] bumpstock75: ESO sucks without the sub.
[4:33:49] Gingerprimer: TBF would be better if everything was on the blizz launcher instead of having to use tons of shitty launhers
[4:33:49] Piztol_Whip: It’s only optional if you like running around with 1 inch deep pockets in game
[4:33:57] bgriff87: Star Trek Online?
[4:34:02] Vivelli: they may be able to now share ideas on new mechanics or how to solve bugs etc
[4:34:04] CaptainJoeyNY: the hell are we?
[4:34:04] HaloS23: @Towelliee You think WoW will go to game pass and if so with the be separate from game pass or part of?
[4:34:06] 3663Sharad: And somehow heTowel still pays for Wildstar LUL
[4:34:11] Joneeeez: @dranet11 Blackwood was the worst dlc to all of them, it maybe be better this year we will see
[4:34:13] Volkien: So it begins
[4:34:19] wazon_7: @Towelliee wow on xbox possible?
[4:34:25] zoot_Z00T: Please god don't make us use the Xbox app to play wow
[4:34:26] Gingerprimer: Yeha I mean more micrtsoft unifiers all the launchers
[4:34:35] Eastwicksavag3: maybe a few xbox games instead of steam taking 30 percent
[4:34:36] CaptainJoeyNY: @wazon_7 it runs on ipad pro
[4:34:41] HaloS23: cool
[4:34:44] smashwow: was there really a reason to put COD on the blizzard launcher? not really but it happened
[4:34:47] jeffnsteff2019: all that would do is troll diehaard eso players and streamers would be crying lol
[4:35:01] Torse9: it's quite fun to read how people think a lot will change
[4:35:09] CaptainJoeyNY: Where is this?
[4:35:10] bgriff87: Have the battle net devs work on xbox app for PC. That needs help
[4:35:11] Gingerprimer: I could see them including old blizz stuff on the gamepass
[4:35:12] Onefishone: That was easy money for Microsoft
[4:35:20] falldrgn: They need WoW to print money.. thats it
[4:35:25] spiked16: @smashwow  Cod is activision blizzard
[4:35:51] Nico_vdM: they can move classic to game pass - so that it can get off my lawn LUL
[4:35:59] CaptainJoeyNY: aahhhhh Northrend
[4:36:01] Sarishkah: Would the purchase change the game do you think?
[4:36:02] mavericks312: 10.0 still needs to be good though
[4:36:10] Joneeeez: how will this merge affect the cod future cod games from now on?
[4:36:31] tigress75422: ikr why im holding off on coming back til about a month or 2 into 10.0
[4:36:31] Volkien: @Towelliee you keep having reasonable thoughts, think profits. getting WoW players to play others games would be easier to monetize if they are all on the same launcher.
[4:36:31] Jamalamadingdong: it may eventually, but not for a good few years yet
[4:36:33] Onefishone: Hell, Activision is even making money off of 15 year old content.  Big excitement with MH and BT coming to TBC soon.
[4:36:37] Gingerprimer: @Joneeeez nothign atm they said
[4:36:39] tigress75422: want to see how it pans out b4 buying it
[4:36:48] Sarishkah: I would hope that the wow sub would be part of the xbox game pass
[4:36:52] SicDogg: thought wow token cost them money ?
[4:36:53] hound0teon: if something works why 'fix' it
[4:36:57] dranet11: hots PogChamp
[4:36:58] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Microsoft Bought Blizzard!? My Reaction and what it means for WoW youtu.be/ZbvkJ2zFAZM
[4:37:05] smashwow: @spiked16 sure. kinda my point. COD wasn't on bnet for years. Activision owned blizz for how long? since roughly 2008. bnet launcher was MOP-ish.
[4:37:06] H0bbitK1ng: the thought people have is that its all in service of building the game pass community
[4:37:07] falldrgn: MS Will just be a Private investment group. They own the company but typically, just let the business run itself
[4:37:08] CallMeWallie: People are also confusing Microsoft buyouts with other companies
[4:37:08] deckardblade: gotta spend money to make moeny
[4:37:13] H0bbitK1ng: so theyd want to push all the traffic there
[4:37:27] smashwow: COD didn't show up until BFA-ish
[4:37:31] smashwow: on the launcher
[4:37:33] Sarishkah: that would be amazing
[4:37:36] jerseyfive: MS got f*** you money
[4:37:38] CallMeWallie: They’re aren’t going to mid max/downsize and burn it to the ground for dividends and payouts abs bail when it goes bankrupt
[4:37:42] Goodbyeperson: @chat is it actually going to be on gamepass???
[4:37:56] Sarishkah: if only if only
[4:37:58] manmower: they're gonna build back the playerbase
[4:38:03] falldrgn: its all speculation at this point
[4:38:14] smashwow: @Goodbyeperson probably not. but we'll know more after 2023 when everything finalizes
[4:38:21] Volkien: But it will make more profits, start thinking like a capitalist @Towelliee . Since when better gets ahead of profits?
[4:38:37] Sarishkah: I know many people who would play again if it were on gamepass
[4:38:39] Jamalamadingdong: lots of business understanders here today
[4:38:50] manmower: does the gamepass even have subscription games on it?
[4:38:59] tigress75422: @Goodbyeperson only 2 options i see is keeping the sub model as is or putting it on gamepass on the $15 option and having it permant on the game pass but donno for sure til everything is finalized next yr
[4:39:05] Volkien: @manmower YES!!
[4:39:23] Sarishkah: very exciting
[4:40:10] ventu105: ?
[4:40:14] Volkien: The MS launcher will become like Steam
[4:40:29] cosmothug: why do you guys care about launchers so much
[4:40:29] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:40:31] Ollie115: @mayer4203 mate i don't know how you can do skinning for money, its boring as fuck
[4:40:40] swordart_19: @cosmothug weirdos
[4:41:17] swordart_19: @cosmothug and look, utility otherwise nothing else.
[4:41:21] Sarishkah: lol @cosmothug  There are tooo many launchers
[4:41:22] ventu105: @Towelliee que haces bro
[4:41:26] Basics315: @Ollie115 good profit though
[4:41:38] Volkien: @cosmothug Because it was a marketing tool to retain players, since most people don't like running multiple launchers on one computer at once
[4:41:52] swordart_19: @sarishkah ye dude 1 extra click the horrors
[4:41:57] Ollie115: @basics315 oh yeh fairplay to people doing it, i just got a wow token that sold for 286k
[4:42:29] swordart_19: @volkien turn off auto start.
[4:42:37] Onefishone: That's why Microsoft is baller status.  Takes money to make money.  You just have to be willing to run with it.
[4:42:41] Mcaffee: Shit now Louis Anderson died
[4:42:44] falldrgn: ^
[4:42:55] Sarishkah: @swordart_19 its extra taxxing on my pc, bro
[4:43:07] chrslp: My apartment building got donuts for the residents on the day that happens to be my bday FeelsGoodMan
[4:43:16] 3663Sharad: ^Yes
[4:43:18] swordart_19: @sarishkah ye dude 2000s pc you have right KEKW
[4:43:28] spiked16: @Towelliee all I care is that the game launches and thats it
[4:43:29] bgriff87: Yeah I think the Java edition is still its own launcher
[4:43:29] 3663Sharad: Minecraft has his own "launcher"
[4:43:40] Joneeeez: when do you believe alpha testing for 10.0 Is starting?
[4:43:47] cosmothug: @Towelliee to what capacity do you think cross faction will be implemented? for ex. just for mythic raids?
[4:43:48] Phantomstrk: i think WoW being added to Gamepass opens up a potential for new players who would try it just because it's on gamepass who otherwise may not of tried it
[4:44:02] Havoc_S1: They will do it just like with ea and Ubisoft you link your game pass account to those accounts and you will get the benefits
[4:44:23] Shrenko: whats going on with Limit ?
[4:44:29] andreaslfc10: bro am thinking about start playing wow for the 1st time whats  the game about?
[4:44:30] Volkien: @swordart_19 which is why it was tested and proven that most people use one launcher 80% more when they have multiple launchers. it is called the Zipf's LAW
[4:44:32] Attackroot: minecraft launcher isnt supported now but can be used. the new microsoft one is the same as the old one just has microsoft info on it
[4:44:38] cosmothug: adding WoW to gamepass is a good idea
[4:44:38] swordart_19: @shrenko announcement of their org
[4:44:47] FleuryGG: uh oh, TSM just tweeted 'It's a food day for another announcement.' hmmmm
[4:45:01] mavericks312: younger ppl dont wanna play wow lol
[4:45:01] Heero_Effect: @shrenko you’re swell :)
[4:45:03] spankymcpie: wow should be something you get from the monopoly game at mcdonalds
[4:45:13] JackHealMe: Game pass for base game and game time but not new expansions
[4:45:13] falldrgn: TSM LIMIT confirmed.. or something idk
[4:45:17] assman_ny: It will get some people sniffing that are new. but its pretty set now with "us" olders haha
[4:45:22] ProCaboose95: they need to do a game pass plus witch is a increase in price so its a wow sub and game pass mixed together
[4:45:23] Shrenko: @Heero_Effect what does that mean?
[4:45:24] swordart_19: Don't think making less Money is Microsoft goal
[4:45:28] Hank_Chinaski: Towelliee do you know Asmongold  IRL?
[4:45:36] swordart_19: @procaboose95 possible
[4:45:36] JackHealMe: Bro you’re talking like you don’t know, such a tease
[4:45:53] chrslp: LUL
[4:45:57] JackHealMe: Risk factor with TSM and the owner atm
[4:45:57] FleuryGG: good day* mobile typing
[4:46:00] cosmothug: asmongold is a hologram
[4:46:12] Zippaya: baaaaad towelliee
[4:46:13] HaloS23: @Towelliee Im just more curious about WoW and game pass cause i dont have game pass and would be cool to have access to the games if WoW was included with it
[4:46:14] Hank_Chinaski: Does not go out much! :)) lol, thanks for the answer! :)
[4:46:16] Sir_LagalotTV: known what?
[4:46:16] chrslp: Everyone knows 90% of wow players are basement goblins
[4:46:23] a23pk: @chrslp true
[4:46:24] gladdyy: surprised it hasn't been leaked yet tbh
[4:46:25] Sarishkah: !origin
[4:46:31] Molvonos: Reggie's always been a massive douche, so it's not surprised it's catching up to him.
[4:46:42] Todmeister9000: @chrslp Hey, I'm a 5th floor goblin!
[4:46:44] EmpathyLiveChat: As an attic goblin, I look down on basement goblins
[4:46:47] chrslp: LUL
[4:46:58] RagingPunk: wow coming to console would be huge imo
[4:47:05] Roaringkittylol: I think WOW should be made into a console game.
[4:47:10] JackHealMe: Investigation with worker treatment etc doesn’t look good. TSM investigation and riot games into the owner and org
[4:47:11] Roaringkittylol: then create WoW 2
[4:47:14] 3663Sharad: Adding WoW to the Game Pass shpuld be a Net loss... cause WoW Player already pay there sub for one game.
[4:47:15] cosmothug: if they did a gamepass + wow combo for 20 or 25 bucks, i wonder if that would be worth it for MS
[4:47:28] a23pk: Blessed
[4:47:31] Polvs: they bought it for mobile games not pc/console
[4:47:53] mavericks312: shadowlands lasting 4 yrs confirmed
[4:48:03] chrslp: @Polvs Oh they 100% bought it for console but they have to wait till the Sony contracts end whenever that is
[4:48:05] tigress75422: yea quality i think will improve because of that too
[4:48:08] assman_ny: Quality of life will continue to improve as well
[4:48:08] xrandomdoodx: better quality of content without the crunchtime, content actually feeling complete PogChamp
[4:48:11] pronkk_: @mavericks312 the fuck are you smoking?
[4:48:19] cybrise: lets hope they get more money into diablo 4 so it gets here faster :P
[4:48:19] swordart_19: @3663sharad true
[4:48:24] tigress75422: and thats one thing wow needs i think more focus on quality
[4:48:26] Armdel: didnt that blizz dev just said less time between content just now though
[4:48:29] Sticky_Arms: I would rather have the delay and a good product then what ever they are doing now
[4:48:47] eevilwithasmile: they arent interested in wow. They are interested in their xbox gaming pass
[4:48:55] cosmothug: @Towelliee are your blizz contacts feeling good about the acquisition?
[4:49:02] Herzenliegen: 100%
[4:49:03] Throdio: I hope MS can take lessons and improve there launcher
[4:49:05] realcousineddie: the rush to get content out is because the hardcore 40-50 hr a week toons get to end game so quickly, then bitch when there isn't anything to do, ie streamers, and since they are influential, blizz listens..viscious circle
[4:49:07] a23pk: 10000%%
[4:49:07] tigress75422: and improving the workplace over at blizz will also help their franchises
[4:49:15] Dracarys_021: I thought renaming the Big Love Rocket was the fix?
[4:49:36] Sticky_Arms: I am hoping for a good D4 release.
[4:49:37] Bayne77: thats what she said?

[4:49:53] Gibby95: What mount are you farming now?
[4:49:56] Meefers: people expect to improve overnight. Shit takes time
[4:50:18] cosmothug: @Yoloblocks it does in corporate leadership. bad leadership is felt all the way at the bottom
[4:50:34] tigress75422: its going be several yrs before we start seeing anythhing
[4:50:39] tigress75422: at least
[4:50:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the deal has to be finalized and then they probably start working on a UI for Xbox
[4:50:48] Piztol_Whip: Workplace morale will reflect game quality. I’m excited for the future for sure.
[4:50:50] chrslp: Yeah the purchase isnt done for MONTHS
[4:51:00] Attackroot: i saw someone say they was gonna resub for 9.2 because MS will make changes by then.. i just laughed.
[4:51:06] assman_ny: In the meantime, relax and enjoy the possibilities
[4:51:11] chrslp: A $60bil purchase isnt like going to the grocery store and swiping your card LUL
[4:51:22] cosmothug: have any blizzard employees spoken about how they feel about the MS acquisition?
[4:51:23] Tygruss: The company I work for got bought from Microsoft last spring, this week I just completed a background check from Microsoft

[4:55:04] pronkk_: @Towelliee he got world 308 us 101 sylv m
[4:55:06] cosmothug: no MS is gonna put the apple store on bnet first
[4:55:08] xEskii: would be a better idea to do it that way
[4:55:19] kaizendart: Nah I think Phil Spencer bought BlizzActivision because he personally has some fan theories for where the WoW story should go.
[4:55:43] Kisswani: KEKW

[4:57:36] Shrenko: Guitar Hero comeback ?!?!? towLets towGo towPog
[4:57:36] DaKevin10: Why do you think activision preferred selling to Facebook over Microsoft
[4:58:22] Heero_Effect: I’m hotly
[4:58:24] tigress75422: @DaKevin10 i think its because few are in the position to be able to buy acti/blizz out in the first place. MS is one of those few/fb is prob another
[4:58:24] kaizendart: Phil plays survival hunter and had to take things into his own hands
[4:58:24] dutchie76: Seal of Fate leveling aint bad, did it on my warrior
[4:58:27] Armdel: "I got rescue these wow players"
[4:58:27] manmower: maybe this was the actual ripcord they were talking about
[4:58:29] vHectiKv: If Facebook bought ActiBlizz, the stock would have plummeted
[4:58:31] falldrgn: The neeed to seal the aquistion by pulling a rip cord
[4:58:35] nothix: i just came across you in the wild lol
[4:58:41] Shrenko: it would be a shit show
[4:58:45] Chum964: I'd expect the end of the game lol
[4:58:45] nothix: every day argent farm
[4:58:49] Kisswani: the vibe would have been way different for sure
[4:58:58] tigress75422: but in the in FB isnt interested in gaming franchise on this scale
[4:59:07] Armdel: have your IRL name displayed at all times in game Kappa
[4:59:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Facebook would have tried to add WoW to the metaverse, yeah
[4:59:14] nothix: I'm down to 3 left
[4:59:15] chrslp: Imagine raiding and the raid pauses for a Facebook ad
[4:59:25] nothix: you were killing my commanders
[4:59:34] girl_rat: bro metaverse? when was the last time these crypto/nftbros metAGIRL
[4:59:38] Chum964: Gotta add people to your facebook friends to add them ingame

[4:59:45] stallowned: LUL
[4:59:47] Molvonos: If Facebook got Activision, we'd get a new lizard race in WoW  to make Fuckerberg feel more at home.
[4:59:48] Jamalamadingdong: hahaha
[4:59:49] tigress75422: actually glad that FB turned em down on buying out acti/blizz
[4:59:50] MadDogMadfes: situationship
[5:00:08] falldrgn: Imagine an add when you die.. in a raid that you can buy revives lol
[5:00:18] nothix: nothix subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Argent Homies
[5:00:19] tigress75422: all FB would finish driving these franchises into the ground
[5:00:22] kaizendart: imagine Zucc's wii sports avatar livecasting the WF race

[5:01:52] chrslp: Tesla
[5:01:53] chrslp: KEKW
[5:01:55] mavericks312: tencent or sony would be the other 2
[5:01:55] N3llee: only a few
[5:02:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are billions of computers with Windows on it, getting Battlenet added by default would be huge
[5:02:08] Maydie6066: what if Amazon bought it just to fuck it into the ground and make NW 1 less competitor
[5:02:21] r0b928: Amazon, apple, Berkshire Hathaway there’s lot
[5:02:24] dugarg_: lol
[5:02:29] pannkakewow: LUL
[5:02:39] N3llee: Amazon, Facebook, Sony, Apple would have been likely candidates just in terms of free cash on hand.
[5:02:39] Heero_Effect: @maydie6066 lol what that makes no sense
[5:02:46] dugarg_: by this day even with all the problems wow remains #1
[5:02:47] Grady2385: bro 9 comercial lol
[5:02:51] KillaPr0: LOL
[5:02:57] KillaPr0: not going to happen\
[5:03:01] kaizendart: What's your most recent rare mount drop?
[5:03:02] Basics315: @Maydie6066 NW isnt good enough for Amazon to invest that much to torpedo it
[5:03:32] N3llee: I think Facebook just didn't want to pay the premium that MS was willing to pay.
[5:03:41] BlueHusky17: microsoft has a lot of hardware and tehc. i think this is the main reason
[5:03:46] N3llee: Now that Facebook's new name is meta
[5:03:51] Screamnsteam: KEKW
[5:04:00] dugarg_: Facebook is still Facebook
[5:04:09] nothix: meta is the company that owns facebook the product

[5:04:14] Highfrosty: twitch turbo pog
[5:04:15] Maydie6066: @Maydie6066 its not, but Bezos has that kind of money
[5:04:19] ClipCraft: the company is meta, the page is still facebook i believe
[5:04:19] Kisswani: we just dont call facebook Kappa
[5:04:21] cybrise: facebook is facebook, meta is the parent company that owns them all
[5:04:22] Screamnsteam: nows a good time to buy metaverse shares before it takes off
[5:04:22] Broomba: facebook is now called myspace 2.0
[5:04:34] N3llee: Its like Alphabet for Google.
[5:04:37] NeoJon82: It's like how alphabet owns google
[5:04:45] dugarg_: Lets hope the metacoins go up

[5:06:22] magiccanvashands: Hey good news tho and probably the best news out of all of this is that Oculus now is no-longer Facebook dependent. You nolonger need a Facebook account to use your oculus device.
[5:06:27] chrslp: New season of Ozark starts tonight FYI anyone that didnt know
[5:06:32] ClipCraft: that sounds so good rn

[5:07:16] vHectiKv: is the HTC one standalone?
[5:07:20] cosmothug: @Towelliee HTC one is way better and way more expensive which is why a lot of people get the oculus
[5:07:23] Jamalamadingdong: the perfect OPENING KEKW
[5:07:25] chrslp: Oculus started getting popular with the Quest 2 because you dont need a badass PC for it
[5:07:28] TheCliffyShow: I think it's called HTC Vive right?
[5:07:29] chrslp: imo
[5:07:34] dalaraz: boots on taurens :p
[5:07:41] Kisswani: so the Raven dudes seem to have officially asked to unionize and for voluntary recognition by Activision , I wonder how they'll respond .
[5:07:44] kaizendart: more like Moo'ts
[5:07:45] TheUnknowing: towelliee just loves moms
[5:07:47] Molvonos: HTC/Valve's kinda their own thing due to the full body tracking.  Quest 2 doesnt have that functionality yet
[5:07:55] HaloS23: @Towelliee the Ref Castle Nath set looks pretty sick IMO
[5:07:56] Densetsu_: I can take that Kappa
[5:08:05] magiccanvashands: 'Meta' as it's now called is doing away with Facebook login requirements for Oculus. In Facebook's presentation yesterday - where it announced that it's changing its name to Meta - the company revealed that Oculus VR will no longer require you to log in.
[5:08:20] HaloS23: Red*
[5:08:26] Voxxzz: Do these mounts (trial of crusader) count for 400 mount achiv?
[5:08:39] dugarg_: all mounts count towards that achiev
[5:08:51] Screamnsteam: Unions aka pay money to suits so they can pretend to care about you LUL
[5:09:02] magiccanvashands: @pizzatimefrank whisper me Ill send you the article link man
[5:09:03] Roaringkittylol: ATVI doesnt really care about anything going on in the company right now. Just keep building them games until we can off load you troublesome employees to Microsoft and Bobby can collect his paycheck,
[5:09:06] HaloS23: @Towelliee Red sorry
[5:09:17] vHectiKv: Pog hippogryph

[5:13:57] Short_Film: Ark had some fun Hunger Game events i remember watching back in the day

[6:02:16] ItsArus: swtor?
[6:02:16] UhDenied: I'm still playing City of Heroes. Some people bought rights to the code and are still developing it
[6:02:21] at1c: well new world?
[6:02:24] ChaoticPriest: Elyon?
[6:02:25] Querran80: secret world
[6:02:39] Draahl: its a 2nd release for lost ark tho, already released in asia
[6:02:39] Theduskflyer: Limit news yet?
[6:02:48] swordart_19: New world is still in alpha imo
[6:02:50] bgriff87: SWTOR felt like 90% of the budget went to leveling and class story. 10% to endgame
[6:02:57] bgriff87: at launch
[6:02:59] Snabido: So QoL stuff part of launch, unlikess wow patches? 😏
[6:03:02] Kisswani: @Theduskflyer nothing yet
[6:03:24] Maydie6066: I wish Rift hadn't fallen off. I loved Rift, even left WoW for it
[6:03:25] Theduskflyer: oh no. Max replied to TSM tweet about an annoucment....
[6:03:41] Attackroot: they have the housing servers working with some bugs still. but having issues with the open world right now.
[6:03:43] Melteoc: awesome mounts
[6:03:45] lannimite: Tedious vanilla leveling was the best. Miss that.
[6:03:47] Malfleur: @Querran80 Secret World was awesome.... At least for Lovecraft Fans and people who don#t want everything to be for free without effort. I still remember the Quest where you had to know or google hebrew names of the plagues <3
[6:03:48] QMGSaint: Best housing still to this day
[6:03:50] Velashen: Housing
[6:03:52] nazvar: world pvp was awsome
[6:03:55] 3663Sharad: Maybe a Wildstar reborn ?
[6:03:57] Draahl: and wildstar was remarkably bug free as well, worked SO well
[6:03:58] Keyastaron_: AND HIS NAME IS BRON CENA Kappa
[6:04:00] Melteoc: so many hours in housing
[6:04:00] 3663Sharad: As a marketing thingy
[6:04:05] nazvar: Wildstar housing was amazing
[6:04:17] stallowned: take away the hardcore raid attunement and it would have been great i think, the leveling was fun, housing. pvp and dungeons were great
[6:04:22] Collected1: the wildstar soundtrack was incredible
[6:04:22] ElectroNYX: I can check my server sir, i'm alliance.. just logged in
[6:04:25] Celestia6: Wildstar was so fun. I loved the music and art style
[6:04:35] Kisswani: How long did it take for Wildstar to fall off ?
[6:04:38] QMGSaint: Have you ever seen the Death of the Game video for WIldstar? It's a great watch
[6:04:50] TheCliffyShow: TheCliffyShow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Just to get rid of the ad breaks.
[6:04:53] BobLongMVP: Harvesting materials while visiting  housing was so fub
[6:04:55] Maego1: Maybe if it release like a year ago with F2P model, it would be successfull
[6:04:56] BobLongMVP: Fun
[6:04:56] Vivelli: only played the game a few minutes, sounds like it was fun?
[6:05:00] Templexx: wonder if any1s thought about revamping it like that
[6:05:04] N3llee: I sat on discord with the devs and despite some of them being really cool there were a few that were horrible about taking feedback.
[6:05:06] nazvar: the combat flow felt like wow
[6:05:12] ClipCraft: did i miss limit announce yet?
[6:05:13] swanvk: react to it KEKW
[6:05:15] Namtarts_TV: WS was and still is my fav combat system
[6:05:22] flebbooo: If they ever get a well functioning pserver of Wildstar working i would def try it
[6:05:22] N3llee: The Chick in charge of Wildstar PvP was a literal insane Karen
[6:05:28] Warpiercer: If Wildstar was so great and such, where was everyone when it was shutting down? Litereally no one was playing it. It was flawed from the start
[6:05:36] mackieeswe: #StarTrekPicard. Season 2 starts March 3 on Paramount+.
[6:05:43] o__mj__o: @nazvar that was the best thing
[6:05:45] CommanderRudolph: @QMGSaint nerdSlayer?
[6:05:49] TheCliffyShow: 7 ads in a row is to much for me. I'm impatient.
[6:05:51] QMGSaint: Yeah Nerdslayer's video
[6:05:59] FergusCreative: I loved the level up announcements
[6:06:03] Draahl: @Towelliee remember on hot review? when they ate ghost peppers and put carolina reaper sauce on the pepper cause the game was hardcore? haha :D
[6:06:08] RalgorStreams: It’s bc a lot of those devs came from EverQuest and that’s as hardcore as it gets
[6:06:15] Collected1: the game was worth playing for this track alone  https://youtu.be/BHAzBaUCcWo
[6:06:15] N3llee: When it went free to play the finally implemented like 100 pages of feedback by players and by then it was to late.
[6:06:18] Attackroot: it was still 20.
[6:06:22] nazvar: @o__mj__o yeah :( good times
[6:06:44] Padarius: i still can't get over how RIFT still has servers. Blows my mind
[6:06:46] swervity82: TSM limit?
[6:07:03] N3llee: NCSOFT kicking out Jeremy Gaftney so early on I think hurt them more then anything
[6:07:05] VerdeSol3: ffs
[6:07:13] Namtarts_TV: i never tried rift
[6:07:16] Heero_Effect: OpticTSMFaZe limit :)
[6:07:18] Padarius: I wanted to like it because it had the cleric class kekw
[6:07:20] Namtarts_TV: wish i would ahve
[6:07:21] ChaoticPriest: personally I liked Aion, but it died after a year or two
[6:07:24] VerdeSol3: I was getting starbucks
[6:07:28] mytherel: TSM Limit confrimed?
[6:07:30] VerdeSol3: some dude with a man purse walk by me
[6:07:32] magiccanvashands: I just did a 1 gram dab without puking Happy Friday
[6:07:36] VerdeSol3: I ask how much you got
[6:07:36] Padarius: yo i forgot about Aion @ChaoticPriest what happened to that game?
[6:07:44] bigbadkenny93: Rift failed due to negligence tbh
[6:07:48] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Did people actually buy that gear? Wasn't it super expensive?
[6:07:55] VerdeSol3: he said 250 clams
[6:08:00] Warpiercer: Selling a new IP without any backstory and name, And selling it for a AAA price game and asking for a sub is a big suicide for any studio, Ex wow developers that created Wildstar lost it to their greed.

[6:08:06] ItsArus: rift is still going? wow
[6:08:10] bgriff87: KEKW
[6:08:35] GroovyBryan: ff and wow
[6:08:42] ChaoticPriest: @Padarius think the endgame was just too grindy for a lot of people. I believe there were other issues, but it's been too long and I can't remember
[6:08:43] nazvar: WS shutting down has be the only MMO that made me truly sad
[6:08:47] N3llee: Ever since Scott Hartsman left the  Trion I stopped caring about Rift. It was down hill after he left.
[6:08:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: ashes will learn this one day
[6:08:52] bigbadkenny93: Seems like a sick job if they are making a decent salary lmao
[6:09:03] Toradin: I realy want 2 see Lotro  with the new amazon show .
[6:09:06] Padarius: @ChaoticPriest thanks!
[6:09:25] ClipCraft: gratz on the mount btw 100% this run
[6:09:31] bigbadkenny93: If Wildstar rereleased FTP, micro-transactions, no P2W, and 20 man content going forward, it would do well.
[6:09:39] Collected1: the shorts were incredible
[6:09:39] Mecabeast: i think we will continue seeing this batttle pass meta
[6:09:46] swordart_19: KEKW
[6:09:55] flebbooo: KEKW
[6:10:00] Collected1: was that jerremy?
[6:10:03] Maego1: you can try this mount 4 times per character basically right?
[6:10:05] N3llee: at the time though the hype train for Wildstar was huge
[6:10:15] funKShun: old farts taking retarded decisions
[6:10:37] bigbadkenny93: Didn't they have a dev report that basically said they spent all their money on development and nearly no advertising? the game was doomed from the start with thayt logic

[6:10:53] QMGSaint: If you get a chance check out the video, it's by Nerdslayer, it's like a documentary into what went wrong.
[6:10:53] Warpiercer: Also the reason NCSOFT shut Wildstar down was, NC dont close games usually, But they knew they couldnt sell and monetize Wildstar on South Korea, So they just pulled the plug.
[6:10:56] stryngs_: i got to kil jaeden last night but couoldnt do it last night on a fresh 60 balance druid
[6:10:59] funKShun: they didn't care
[6:11:00] stryngs_: but i suck

[6:11:13] Namtarts_TV: the beta process was huge between me and my friends
[6:11:13] Shiekrunner: there were some poeple like kungen promiting it but thats it
[6:11:14] flebbooo: I was too focused on wod hype at the time Wildstar came out FeelsBadMan
[6:11:14] Malfleur: There was no hype at all. only those who actually knew, knew
[6:11:15] pronkk_: will we see a fade to black in the name of Activision over time?
[6:11:16] Shiekrunner: *through streaming
[6:11:18] Namtarts_TV: it was a big deal in my circles
[6:11:30] funKShun: look at GW2 .. they get the shit compared to other NCSoft games
[6:11:31] Shiekrunner: *promoting
[6:11:34] Vivelli: @Heero_Effect cope, u know its FF atm. maybe once 10.0 comes out it will be again
[6:11:36] CordovaGC: I'd play the shit outta Wildstar if it was still around that game was really beautiful!! an the the streaming community behind it was not to bad aswell
[6:11:37] N3llee: I think it was hyped in the MMO space. All the top guilds in WoW and other MMOs were in Wildstar Alpha.
[6:11:42] Pogodruid: @Heero_Effect On the road to be Glorious BloodTrail
[6:11:54] GroovyBryan: GW2 would be amazing if it got more attention.
[6:11:57] Velashen: They cut several other Guild Wars projects.
[6:12:00] Nokterian: TRUE
[6:12:07] Celestia6: I did not know it was still around
[6:12:14] funKShun: trash eastern expired mmos
[6:12:18] Nokterian: GW2 is amazing
[6:12:20] Maego1: i wonder if they will ever try to remake lineage 2
[6:12:29] Screamnsteam: Jagex buys MIcrosoft EZ
[6:12:30] Warpiercer: Its because their market is South Korea. West is just some dollar funnels to them nothing more.
[6:12:30] Malfleur: Blade & Soul was awesome tho. I muss my girls there a lot
[6:12:30] MagicMalTv: !headset
[6:12:34] stryngs_: it shocks me they arent working on gw3
[6:12:44] grimmlols: Can you drop your elvUI link?
[6:12:58] Heero_Effect: @vivelli it’s my taste personally ff doesn’t fit my tastes what’s wrong

[6:13:42] stryngs_: is there some kind of bad luck protection on these mount runs?
[6:13:53] swordart_19: @bloogaymer rarity
[6:13:57] Warpiercer: Also, GW2 appeals to asian aesthetics and is being played in Korea. NCsoft thinks about this and nothing more.
[6:14:00] Vivelli: sell Wildstar to Microsoft
[6:14:05] Toradin: i remember Auto Assault lol
[6:14:15] BlooGaymer: @swordart_19 Thankies :D

[6:45:24] Eastwicksavag3: what they want to do?
[6:45:25] balancedlight: what are they trying to do for Wrath?
[6:45:28] Eastwicksavag3: what do they want to do?
[6:45:34] gdtomii: i HOPE they go to MoP for classic
[6:45:38] DarkviperTV: I think wrath will be the last classic
[6:45:51] purpleshadow1: 9.2 is going to launch on same day as Lost Ark isn't it? :(
[6:45:56] Eastwicksavag3: >.>
[6:46:00] Holysal: @gdtomii nope this will be the last imo

[6:46:17] gdtomii: @gdtomii let me have hope
[6:46:20] lannimite: HERESY Cata was amazing
[6:46:21] flebbooo: Atleast 60 or 70
[6:46:31] garnfolf: at this point just let us swap freely and take out renown LUL

[6:47:10] thiccsushi: Just give the 80 renown token since they abandoned the renown updates for 9.2
[6:47:12] Maydie6066: @Towelliee i would accept a change from "grants renown level 40" to "gives 40 renown" so that if you are at 30, you can get to 70
[6:47:12] Pogodruid: LIKE WE HAVE THEM TIME FOR THAT Kappa
[6:47:13] Dracarys_021: alts makes sense
[6:47:24] Squeak_Official: I started shadowlands for the first time just after Christmas and I was able to hit level 60 and then get to 80 renown within 2 weeks of casual play. I don’t think it’s that bad. Definitely crappy for alts though
[6:47:26] garnfolf: just get rid of renown...
[6:47:31] miser_o: you can buy 40 renown?

[7:40:58] mikyki: echo also had something to prove
[7:41:01] mytherel: it looked obvious to me that max had too many people in his ear as far as analyst go
[7:41:02] Halgrender: Also, Echo is fucking good too. So there's that

[7:41:48] JackHealMe: Method top 5 this year
[7:41:52] jmalmin: I just hear it from some of the guild leaders they do struggle some with the recruitment. I can also see it with my own guild that had over 100 people at the start of Shadowlands. now there are 4 people online. I do hope you are right, its always fun to watch a good race for world first.

[7:43:55] jmalmin: This new zone does look really good. Cant wait to see it go live.

[7:44:23] joethephanimal: I got it on my first time doing the boss in LFR

[7:44:58] akia03: yep
[7:45:12] Cetraben: Zereth chest gear was giving me 246/242
[7:45:15] JediNeo99999: i've only gotten 246 once but most was ~233
[7:45:30] LadyJasmin: no don't! the last time you put in a ticket for a mount it took another 5 years to get it
[7:45:34] bumpstock75: SAFTY NET?
[7:45:38] akia03: one of the cyphers resource things increases it
[7:45:59] gurnt4: 500 per slot or whole set
[7:46:07] Maymort: !keyboard
[7:46:18] Antdavs24: Wait what
[7:46:19] Korupcija_: @JinzDan "Lob", don't think he streams or anything
[7:46:22] gurnt4: ah ok yeah very fair
[7:46:37] Theduskflyer: Wonder if they will make a buff to leveling to 60
[7:47:07] akia03: isnt the anima gear 226
[7:47:13] captivate7: its super quick and easy
[7:47:14] bigbadkenny93: Nah, leveling takes like no time.
[7:47:20] TheUnknowing: takes less than a day to get to 60 from 1
[7:47:21] Riggoz1: it's not about farming now, its players coming back to get anima
[7:47:24] watznable: if you think 1-60 is hard your just slow , time atm is insane
[7:47:26] iblighters: 50-60 is like 4 hours
[7:47:31] LeronisGaming: i'm 60 and just in ardenweld
[7:47:46] whiph: leveling now is just a joke
[7:47:48] FryeTV: they didi buff it. just pay for it :)
[7:47:49] FryeTV: lol
[7:47:55] Screamnsteam: do you have all the heritage armor?
[7:47:57] ifirnja: are there quests in zereth who give anima rewards or do i have to play "old" content?
[7:47:57] Korupcija_: they need to bump xp in threads of fate
[7:48:22] bumpstock75: You can go from 1 to 50 in weekend
[7:48:22] bigbadkenny93: Leveling is just a joke now, but it shouldn't be. The journey is most important not the destination...right? :p
[7:48:40] TheUnknowing: i did 1-60 in 18 hours a few weeks ago and I fucked around A LOT so it can probably be done even faster
[7:48:50] LadyJasmin: without doing any dungeons how long does it take to get to 60?
[7:48:50] titanknighttv: @Towelliee i just lvled a toon tday from 1-50 in 6 hours 37 minutes
[7:49:04] RageerPLZ: @Pashski depends on the game, vanilla was the journey but I feel every expo after was about the endgane
[7:49:09] Screamnsteam: @TheUnknowing mostly dungeons?
[7:49:10] Korupcija_: is stream buffering or just me
[7:49:22] BabzyJae: Where did you level at for only 6hours? babzyjMonkaS
[7:49:25] Yzuthoth: 1-60 only takes like 12-15 hours if you really wanna optimize
[7:49:27] joethephanimal: Okay, so I haven't done it in a while, but in 9.1 it took me about 10 hours /played to get to 50, and then 4-5 chaining dungeons as a tank to get to 60.
[7:49:28] bumpstock75: few classes are starting at lvl 10 also
[7:49:30] MexicanMisker: @Towelliee this last race is the "winner take all" one, so im not surprised the top guilds are being secretive... might be another year before 10.0 comes out
[7:49:33] TheUnknowing: yes @Screamnsteam mostly dungeons, questing inbetween cause dps queues
[7:49:44] CardinalTX: @Korupcija_ for me also
[7:49:51] AltChillUP_: true
[7:49:58] akia03: whose wa are you using in the center? @Towelliee
[7:50:01] chris80m: but the hardest at max level to get into
[7:50:07] mrelgaato: !wa
[7:50:08] feherlofia123: leveling is good
[7:50:08] Moobot: @mrelgaato we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at wago.io/search/luxthos |You can find the leveling EXP bar here! | wago.io/LuxthosExperienceBar
[7:50:10] attonix: my biggest thing about leveling is how easy they made it
[7:50:11] flebbooo: Chromie time is really nice, only sucks that new players get forced into bfa
[7:50:13] ItsXolten: 394 attempts WTF lol
[7:50:15] Halgrender: 394 and counting WTF
[7:50:17] Screamnsteam: @TheUnknowing o kk, im about to start leveling some toons for heritage armor so just trying to find the most optimal way
[7:50:19] TheUnknowing: Luxthos @akia03
[7:50:40] Khade_Tyrson: what addon is it for the number count on boss kills?
[7:50:42] an_optimist: is luxthos coming back?'
[7:50:50] akia03: @TheUnknowing  ah his still works and being updated?
[7:50:51] AltChillUP_: what is the drop rate
[7:50:53] TheUnknowing: You will get it done pretty quick, very simple @Screamnsteam
[7:50:57] littlebaoboy: could be worse, im on 837 trys for green infernal from nighthold...
[7:51:00] mrniceguy817: I just lvld my dk up to 60 absolute worst part is doing a covenant campaign for the 6th time
[7:51:03] jmalmin: Wait you can buy new gear from anima in 9.2?
[7:51:05] Bayne77: pushing for the record Kappa
[7:51:09] TheUnknowing: Still works and I believe he will be updating them for 9.2 @akia03
[7:51:15] mytherel: who cares if leveling is easy...its a 17 year old game with tons of content
[7:51:17] swordart_19: @mrniceguy817 You can skip it
[7:51:33] nothix: how do you get that rarity display like you have?
[7:51:35] mrniceguy817: WHAT
[7:51:37] attonix: wait is there no lockout on old raids now?
[7:51:37] mrniceguy817: For real?
[7:51:40] AltChillUP_: what is the drop rate @towelliee
[7:51:41] Korupcija_: @jmalmin 500 anima each slot, 226 ilvl
[7:51:46] Plague_GG: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[7:51:50] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee i got Chronos enchant look and the red infernal in the same run
[7:51:51] phantom0803: i was pushing 10 tries a week for ji-kun for 30 weeks so i feel so little anymore
[7:51:52] LecterSRK: @swordart_19 did they add that button that gives all the rewards and stuff?
[7:51:56] swordart_19: @mrniceguy817 yes but you don't get base mog from campaign
[7:52:01] Frosttyy13: Do you think its possible andiun and jailer both have mythic only phases?
[7:52:01] dolan_gaming: IDK @Towelliee I ran Lich king for invincible over 2k attempts before it dropped
[7:52:10] boxxxxxxxxxxx: big wiener sub
[7:52:10] swordart_19: @lectersrk nope, never happening
[7:52:16] LecterSRK: @swordart_19 thats so fucked
[7:52:27] Korupcija_: towelliee are you dropping frames maybe
[7:52:31] mrniceguy817: @swordart_19 Looking it up now it’s my 3rd necrolord so for sure skipping
[7:52:39] OnyxBere: I feel like no matter how much I play I’m not going to get good enough gear to get into higher content
[7:52:43] kenphil: towellie do you play any classic TBC?
[7:52:43] swordart_19: @mrniceguy817 talk to NPC's and read LUL
[7:52:43] mrniceguy817: Thank you btw
[7:52:46] Bayne77: they will; have LFR only phases :D

[7:53:01] Jppavv: Hi Towell, yes thanks for the content.
[7:53:02] Korupcija_: just asking :)
[7:53:17] Sielu11628: @mrihonvbere What is your ilvl?
[7:53:22] attonix: @Towelliee whats highest key thats been cleared so far?
[7:53:26] swordart_19: @mrniceguy817 can skip campaign soulbinds are near conduit forge then can skip straight to Korthia to 3/9
[7:53:27] phantom0803: got to make friends in the game, its very very hard to do content without guild or groups
[7:53:36] OnyxBere: I’m like 200 210
[7:53:55] balanira: u dont care about +20 portals ?
[7:53:56] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Microsoft Bought Blizzard!? My Reaction and what it means for WoW youtu.be/ZbvkJ2zFAZM

[7:54:14] seemfonee: are Transmogs account wide or just server?
[7:54:27] Jppavv: @Towelliee Are those Gunnar glasses?
[7:54:31] Screamnsteam: @seemfonee account
[7:54:32] shimwood: Just fly and summon
[7:54:39] swordart_19: Pushing 20 for portal KEKW
[7:54:40] seemfonee: ah thanks
[7:54:42] phantom0803: yeah people a lil wrapped up about that portal life
[7:54:44] OnyxBere: Yeah I hear you 100% I just feel like it’s an endless I’m not trying to complain to much
[7:54:48] yonima: it sucks that it has an 8hr cd but it resets once you complete a dungeon
[7:54:50] Molvonos: The portal rewards were such a let down
[7:54:54] Korupcija_: so true, can't believe people are fine with portals being reward for +20
[7:54:57] mrniceguy817: @swordart_19 Yes that’s what I just read which is nice but skipping the entire convent campaign would be nicer haha
[7:54:59] Maydie6066: @Towelliee what hat is that Kappa
[7:55:07] Sylvia_Dream: 220
[7:55:12] akia03: 233 at max
[7:55:15] OhNoNotAgain: After getting all dungeon portals on 3 toons, people can just summon me if im on another toon at this point
[7:55:17] swordart_19: Korthia can upgrade gear too and get 226 conduits too
[7:55:18] balanira: u can upgrade the korthia gear to 233
[7:55:18] CardinalTX: well you can upgrade to 220
[7:55:19] QuigsTV: @Towelliee next season youll be able to buy an item to upgrade your conduits if you do a 20 or something of the sort. Im gonna go for portals next season
[7:55:32] Retreatless: towHi
[7:55:37] CardinalTX: save gold and buy 240 item from AH
[7:55:40] OnyxBere: I guess I’m not playing enough
[7:55:44] swordart_19: @mrniceguy817 ye I wanted Mog's on some armors
[7:55:50] bajeeraboi: Towlie - thoughts on WoW through gamepass? Entire catalog + increased users? win win

[7:56:19] swordart_19: !yt
[7:56:20] Moobot: @swordart_19 Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Microsoft Bought Blizzard!? My Reaction and what it means for WoW youtu.be/ZbvkJ2zFAZM
[7:56:23] QuigsTV: @OhNoNotAgain isnt that doing a +20 of each dungeon on tyrannical/fortified
[7:56:38] swordart_19: @quigstv I think yes
[7:56:53] shimwood: WoW on GamePass has about as much possibility as Guitar Hero coming back LUL
[7:56:54] swordart_19: everyone started from 0
[7:56:58] bumpstock75: shot got 220 from do weekly assault
[7:57:19] swordart_19: @shimwood you do know Microsoft owns both
[7:57:26] balanira: i didnt play 9.0 after getting to 60 i did korthia for 230 gear and then started from +2 m+ to +15s
[7:57:34] OhNoNotAgain: @QuigsTV yes and no, you can push other dungeons higher and avoid doing 20 in one of the others
[7:57:35] Sediz: weekly worldboss chance on 233 drop
[7:57:38] CardinalTX: The gear grind is real but there are plenty of ways to go about it
[7:57:41] FryeTV: 200 ilvl? do mythic dungeons,get a key keep doing it
[7:57:42] noah16hallmark: could do 5 tw dungeons for free 226 piece this week
[7:58:00] swordart_19: buy cheap EZ
[7:58:28] QuigsTV: @OhNoNotAgain so similar to ksm  but higher keys
[7:58:33] OhNoNotAgain: @QuigsTV yup
[7:58:34] MexicanMisker: tbh the 262 leggos are only relevant if you're like a Mythic raider, 95% of casuals are fine with a lower version
[7:58:48] Xanigh: Btw, how much anima u get in the new zone?
[7:58:55] ZakuzaGB: yeah its irritating because im like do i start grinding all the covs on my potential main or not
[7:58:58] Maydie6066: @swordart_19 if you are solo pugging stuff, it will start you off yeah, but trying to get into even 15's as a pug with a 190/210 leggo will kill your ilvl and nerf your chances of acceptance
[7:58:59] Khade_Tyrson: i farmed valor, stigya, and bought the 200 ilvl gear then went right into heroic raiding now I'm 245 and raiding mythic SoD
[7:59:30] Bayne77: i took a 50 yesterday, bought the renown token for them and by doing the questing got to 60 with renown in the upper 50s by the end
[7:59:30] Khade_Tyrson: 9 runs in torgasht got lego made
[7:59:30] benefic320: do you pvp?
[7:59:35] swordart_19: @maydie6066 I make own groups mostly if I don't get in after 1 min
[7:59:49] swordart_19: PepeHands
[7:59:51] Screamnsteam: Jebaited
[7:59:52] DarkviperTV: no 394
[8:00:02] Angryfist40: i know you have been asked this already, but what do you guys think about Microsoft buying out Activision Blizzard?
[8:00:03] Brodih_: what size Herman miller aeron did you get B or C ? @Towelliee
[8:00:05] Rumplefust: you're missing battle shout
[8:00:24] Maydie6066: @swordart_19 and some people can do that, some people just don't like that route. but not making your own groups shouldn't prevent you getting into groups
[8:00:40] swordart_19: @angryfist40 POGGERS if you want towellie answer check YouTube
[8:00:41] Khade_Tyrson: all my horde are 50

[8:01:14] Maydie6066: Tow just needs a dps to push the health to 0, pretty sure tanking isnt the issue
[8:01:20] swordart_19: @maydie6066 then you are by own choice in mercy of others
[8:01:22] Reckless_Monk: maybe not change culture wise. but youll see more people getting fired in managment :)
[8:02:28] MrGattz: im not really sure why people think changes are coming in a week. or a month. this will be a several years in the making project. we would be lucky to see anything major by the end of this year and by major i mean like maybe wow on xbox considering it already has controller support built into the game.
[8:02:35] onybear: Hazel has
[8:02:41] dracullus: Asmon exaggerated? no way
[8:02:48] swordart_19: Venruki is clueless he mad people don't do pvp
[8:02:58] Maydie6066: @MrGattz because the world doesn't have patience, we want instant gratification on everything Kappa
[8:03:09] Reckless_Monk: Doom and gloom
[8:03:12] MrGattz: @Maydie6066 i mean your not wrong
[8:03:13] micahmckittrick: what happened to Asmon? Haven't heard him in a min
[8:03:17] balanira: asmongold editor is so good in clickbaiting
[8:03:19] swordart_19: Both are out of touch
[8:03:30] dawgystyle_13: why are we listening to people that don't play or play classic anyway?
[8:03:35] Shalamyne: @Myker8043 he streams on his second account
[8:03:35] CapDan: or they're just chasing the most viewership posible?
[8:03:40] Halgrender: @Myker8043 streaming in his secondary channel alsmot every day
[8:03:48] MrGattz: @after_xxx #DramaSells thats why
[8:03:49] micahmckittrick: ah I see. Thanks!
[8:03:51] swordart_19: If you right now go make yourself guide you see new players everywhere
[8:03:52] geokouts: is everyon ready for WoW Wrath of Clippy?
[8:04:03] Unwary: @balanira sensational titles brings in the ad money
[8:04:05] TheUnknowing: nah venruki shit didnt make sense
[8:04:12] pixxelina: Venruki had ONE example of a player who quit, therefore it applies to all new players LOL
[8:04:18] pixxelina: mercy
[8:04:25] H0bbitK1ng: i dunno, there is such a gate to the end game at the moment for new players
[8:04:26] NiteOwl11617: Think that WoW has the potential to learn from FFXiV and improve the story experience of leveling with Chromie Time.
[8:04:29] swordart_19: Dude is not even guide totally clueless KEKW
[8:04:33] H0bbitK1ng: if you didnt start at the beginning of the patch its horrible
[8:04:37] dawgystyle_13: click bait, #'s
[8:04:39] dracullus: there will always be this guy who has issues returning even if catch up is big red sign CLICK HERE TO GET ALL STUFF
[8:04:44] leon1071: its intentional clickbait to make you waste 9 minutes watching a video
[8:04:48] feherlofia123: catch up IS hard tho
[8:04:49] Maydie6066: @MrGattz I assume you've been logging this chat for a transcript submission to Bravo right? #Drama
[8:04:59] TheDasmius: i dont know any new player. the newest starts at Legion
[8:05:11] mrniceguy817: Do you think after Microsoft deal goes through we might see some type of sub numbers or still be hush hush?
[8:05:14] swordart_19: @thedasmius become guide

[8:05:34] nozcystic: the reknown token 40 is perfect...i was 80 before i hit 60
[8:05:35] feherlofia123: dom shards and honor gear for pvp entry is rough
[8:05:38] Reckless_Monk: People always come back for the new Tier of raiding
[8:05:38] nozcystic: lvl60
[8:05:44] jmalmin: When you get to level 60 you should have from 60 to 65 renown if you do it right :)
[8:05:52] swordart_19: Want to help newcomers chat? Go become guide and see for yourself Ez
[8:06:00] bogv: hello, what do you main nowadays?
[8:06:08] rivera9: I'm ignoring Dom shards
[8:06:19] swordart_19: Ye shard can't farm drops is lame rest is EZ
[8:06:19] dracullus: I'm all for account-wide Renown, but they shouldn't give it away like candies to returning people, especially since it's doable in few days
[8:06:27] Khade_Tyrson: lol i told you i was
[8:06:39] Collected1: in 10.0 i want an account wide paragon level system
[8:06:44] Collected1: everything you do in game at max level contributes
[8:06:53] swordart_19: @collected1 would be Pog
[8:07:02] Aro725: Yep Ive been gearing my lock, bang out a weekly 15 and youll be 252 by the time 9.2 comes out
[8:07:07] Reckless_Monk: yeah just M+ gear. the dom gems dont matter in a few weeks
[8:07:13] wickedmgg: you can still raid whichout them now
[8:07:16] swervity82: thats not what the video is about
[8:07:37] LecterSRK: but thats not what he said
[8:07:38] swordart_19: @wickedmgg I did Lego without Lego KEKW
[8:07:53] swordart_19: @wickedmgg *normal raid
[8:07:57] swervity82: it's not about a forum post its a guy venruki was helping who came back to the game and had no idea about conduits .... legendaries
[8:08:03] Kstrad: I agree with Ven’s video
[8:08:12] nxtlolz: it is not the game feeling like b4 thats why i quit
[8:08:12] MotleyGrue: Yeah Ven is projecting in that vid. A lot.
[8:08:28] LadyJasmin: sloot played his example. i heard it and even gullible me thought it was BS
[8:08:29] brizgalan: hello!!! BRO!!!
[8:08:29] swordart_19: @swervity82 if you willingly ignore story and quests explaining it , you did it to yourself
[8:08:32] wickedmgg: @swordart_19 right its not that big of a diff now.. at the start of the raid for sure
[8:08:36] Unwary: @swervity82 i kinda blame the guy for not looking up current WoW pvp videos for not catching up on the meta
[8:08:39] dracullus: many, maybe even most people quiting after launch just doesn't want to play same game for 2 years and they come back only for expacs
[8:08:44] Unwary: if u want to pvp then u need to know the meta or get rekt
[8:08:47] swordart_19: @swervity82 literally voiced quests explaining everything in game via story
[8:08:47] rivera9: well PaYING 50+ K per LEGO is why I quit
[8:08:48] Reckless_Monk: yep
[8:08:57] swervity82: @swordart_19 true, but the guy just wanted to pvp

[8:09:00] FearedReaper: i agree i dont think people are quiting just because they have to farm soul ash and renown i think there is more to it than that
[8:09:12] Mr_O: Im getting back into wow and going to level a hunter is WoD still the fastest way to level?
[8:09:28] swordart_19: @swervity82 his problem play bad genre then you do quests since you start game
[8:09:42] CapDan: @Mr_O have you considered playing for fun rather than speed?
[8:09:50] Collected1: i quit because i'm simply bored of the game. it offers me no real motivation to log in anymore. but that's just me. everyone is different. i hope 10.0 pulls me back in. especially if they introduce a dark ranger class.
[8:09:53] Reckless_Monk: MoP still best PVP
[8:10:03] swordart_19: @fearedreaper He is Madge arena junkie
[8:10:10] Collected1: * race
[8:10:27] CapDan: YES PLEASE
[8:10:31] dracullus: well Soul Ash should drop from every type of content, beside that you can do most stuff in PVP
[8:10:31] swervity82: @swordart_19 i just dumbed it down, but i totatlly agree with venruki's take.... i would watch the video
[8:10:33] FearedReaper: @swordart_19 ahh i see
[8:10:39] QuigsTV: @towelliee this is it here
[8:10:41] swordart_19: I did PvP season 1 for gear,PvP only Andy's and some clowns whined guess what I stopped PvP and everyone else too.
[8:10:46] balanira: they should make every honor and conquest gear scale to mythic tier ilvl in instanced pvp but different ilvl in open world and pve
[8:10:46] Collected1: if blizz said all classes for all races that would pull me back in too
[8:10:54] swordart_19: That was legion and PvP was dead
[8:11:01] CapDan: but it would force them to balance classes better than they currently do
[8:11:17] swordart_19: These who whine and changes they want are actually decreasing amount of people doing pvp
[8:11:42] swordart_19: Towellie prime example PvP no gear doesn't do it EZ many did same
[8:12:05] lightsflux: agreed
[8:12:28] Qelvue: in sea of thieves the pveers wanna escape the pvpers xD

[8:12:57] reggiepowa: didnt they do it in legion?
[8:12:59] swordart_19: Watch 5 and half of them then playing there
[8:13:07] iblighters: Didn't we do something like that in legion
[8:13:24] QuigsTV: @Towelliee A problem is that no matter what blizzard does theres always people who gonna complain about it
[8:13:30] ShadowbladeRai: bro you guys complaining about druids in raid now they getting 10% increase overall when they already broken in pvp.
[8:13:34] Halgrender: 396
[8:13:37] lightsflux: i actually liked doing pve for the trinkets in wotlk, after mop doing raiding content for pvp just felt worse for some reason
[8:13:50] phantom0803: My biggest complaints on pvp, is that you should be able to actually earn conquest through non rated stuff, and be able to queue for rated as a solo
[8:13:54] SpoonManes: run away little girl!
[8:14:00] CardinalTX: if you want 100% pvp mortal online 2 releases in 4 days  LUL
[8:14:03] Roaringkittylol: Whatever happened to making honor gear reasonable to obtain... without having to sink countless hours leveling that honor gear up...
[8:14:03] spiked16: just 4 more tries xD
[8:14:05] Sylvia_Dream: still no mount?
[8:14:15] swordart_19: That add-on is laughing at you KEKW
[8:14:37] swordart_19: They will always whine and make excuses instead of looking into mirror
[8:14:51] Jigawatts42: so make it like FFXIV pvp?
[8:14:56] Khade_Tyrson: i liked how they did the warmode open world in BFA, if they can make the PVP generate behind that system.
[8:14:57] dracullus: so gear doesn't matter like in Legion, guess what they hated it
[8:15:01] SpoonManes: ground up stat balancing
[8:15:02] Gappopo: Sounds good in theory if classes are balanced.
[8:15:04] natevic: so the only thing that is changeable is talents and talent
[8:15:33] phantom0803: do you think there should be any gear progression in rated or just rating?
[8:15:43] CapDan: "if classes are balanced".... is that even possible?
[8:15:48] donpablo_98: towClap towClap towClap

[8:16:18] Mazeltough: @CapDan no
[8:16:23] TheUnknowing: with blizzard? no @CapDan
[8:16:24] lightsflux: idk why i always miss mop pvp even though it wasnt the most balanced at all
[8:16:39] swordart_19: @lightsflux nostalgia
[8:16:39] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[8:16:43] phantom0803: @CapDan I think its possible, but they would have to put a lot of actual work into it, and blizzard has said pvp isnt a focus at all
[8:16:54] CapDan: @swordart_19 white piece first advantage says you're wrong.
[8:17:02] ShadowbladeRai: I wish gear was all around good for all modes
[8:17:23] jmalmin: Classes are not that far from each other today. It all depends on what your gear is and who is playing the character.
[8:17:26] swordart_19: @capdan first move is not advantage depends how you look at it :P
[8:17:30] SpoonManes: thats the fine line between changing something that already works and trying to add new variety to it to keep it fresh, sometimes bad additions/systems and variables muddy up the balance factor.
[8:17:30] lightsflux: @swordart_19 i mean i played since wrath and it always sticks out as the most fun pvp but you could be right
[8:17:31] CapDan: @TheUnknowing with classes that are designed to be different.... it's impossible
[8:17:53] TheUnknowing: pretty much
[8:17:55] CapDan: @swordart_19 In chess, there is a general consensus among players and theorists that the player who makes the first move (White) has an inherent advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56 percent.
[8:18:30] swordart_19: @capdan such low different doesn't translate to effective advantage
[8:18:33] CapDan: literally google-able to show that Chess isnt "balanced.
[8:18:52] swordart_19: @capdan could say thinking that mad them play bad :P
[8:19:31] CapDan: you're joking right? thats a massive difference. 2-6% over an opponent? it's not small at all.
[8:19:44] biggielev: Did I miss the Anduin fight?
[8:19:51] CapDan: lunch then fihgt
[8:19:55] swordart_19: 10%+ is noticeable
[8:20:01] Huwerdo: Does Anduin die?!
[8:20:01] biggielev: Sweet
[8:20:04] jmalmin: 280k gold for a game token that is 45k less then last I got one. new gametime for for me! :D
[8:20:09] Crypticedge: any idea what trinkets he is using??
[8:20:16] swordart_19: @capdan want chess duel you go white
[8:21:04] phantom0803: ooohhhhh calling him out
[8:21:12] CapDan: @swordart_19 just because I know some stats about chess doesnt mean Im good at it. Straight up Trash at chess :p
[8:21:35] phantom0803: that is the truth, capdan sucks at chess
[8:21:40] swordart_19: See not decided by color who wins
[8:21:46] CapDan: ouch Phanny. that hurts.
[8:22:12] CapDan: that percentage advantage extends even to computers v players though.
[8:22:33] phantom0803: @swordart_19 its saying if you take 2 players of what would be called "Equal skill" statistically the player going first will win
[8:22:47] swordart_19: @capdan I trust pc more interesting
[8:23:23] feherlofia123: second poop ?

[8:28:15] CapDan: @swordart_19 all in all, it's not perfectly clear that there is an unbalance in chess... but the real world impact is a 2-6% better chance of winning as white.

[9:19:58] Skars111: wasnt he meant ot be an end boss?
[9:20:05] TomatoPhalanges: to be fair he's meant to be an end boss
[9:20:10] Hjolt: well he probably has an important cutscene somewhere inbetween
[9:20:12] Elwhappo: i welcom our new priest overlord
[9:20:55] lalelusa: is that actual room or just the room they use for testing? looks so bland
[9:21:36] Aidler: so I take Anduin is not the most fun fight of the new raid
[9:21:40] Trobbels: u need to look at the color of the circle
[9:21:41] 3663Sharad: you where purple and he yellow yes
[9:21:43] cabalish: i believe there are three various markers

[9:24:57] brootalbemo: brootalbemo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! Almost over the hill!

[9:25:36] Hrurcf: How’s this fight so far?
[9:25:42] NippponSteel: @Towelliee nah someone in chat said its hard for them to go a day without, not you my man
[9:25:44] c0nan666: X
[9:25:53] Tendag: can you please tell me what 10.0 will be?
[9:25:59] ZakuzaGB: are all the BM hunters still NF for this ?
[9:26:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: i usually only drink for social events
[9:26:10] swordart_19: @Tendag no one knows let your fantasy run wild!

[9:26:54] Shoutamouil: drinking wine or drinking nothing
[9:26:57] KawaXIV: hey im a xiv guy i dont watch wow, but i read somewhere that the 9.2 raid will have only 8 bosses for a week and then 11 the week after? how does that affect world race in your game?
[9:27:03] Sylvia_Dream: anymore LUL
[9:27:05] KawaXIV: is that really abnormal?
[9:27:05] uawildcat04: 40????? NO WAY
[9:27:07] KawaXIV: or why would that happen
[9:27:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: they have like 20-30 not 40
[9:27:15] ZakuzaGB: sloot has loads of shots and never seems drunk haha
[9:27:26] KawaXIV: i meant to say i don't play wow*** i sometimes watch wow lmao
[9:27:30] Aidler: there is so much alcohol consumed in brov night it is considered a public health risk
[9:27:36] NippponSteel: 1 beer and im feeling it already LUL, dont get me wrong I can crank shots... not 40 but ya I dont feel like id want to haha
[9:27:37] MrGattz: @Tendag yeah ofc. so as of right now they are removing the panda race from the game. we will be going to a new planet and azeroth will be destroyed. the lich king comes back as the new king of stormwind and thrall and kadghar team up to destroy the outlands
[9:27:48] joe_g_433: @kawaxiv it will only effect heroic week. Mythic week will have all 11
[9:27:53] mrniceguy817: Is this with 2 legos?
[9:27:53] TomatoPhalanges: @KawaXIV it probably won't, the 11 boss week is when the proper hard mode of the content starts - this is still abnormal though
[9:28:07] MrGattz: oh and theres cross faction everything with account wide rep
[9:28:07] KawaXIV: @joeg433 oh oh i see, so its 8 bosses and only up to heroic, and then the week after is mythic with all 11?
[9:28:16] Tendag: @MrGattz thx
[9:28:16] KawaXIV: @KawaXIV so it's abnormal? was a reason given?
[9:28:18] TomatoPhalanges: yep
[9:28:24] FUBARtastic: yeah
[9:28:24] MrGattz: hey np!
[9:28:28] TomatoPhalanges: @KawaXIV narrative reasons apparently
[9:28:36] Tendag: @MrGattz what about the woonz?
[9:28:38] KawaXIV: is it *completely* unprecedented?
[9:28:39] FUBARtastic: yall wiped when he touched mid
[9:28:55] MrGattz: the woonz are with azeroth which is destroyed
[9:28:58] joe_g_433: @kawaxiv for story they did it.
[9:29:00] MrGattz: so they were never healed
[9:29:00] NippponSteel: 10.0 will have 15 bosses for raid.
[9:29:12] Sollice: @MrGattz You forget the Scarlet Monastery secret child coming in to challenge for all humanity rule
[9:29:32] TomatoPhalanges: @KawaXIV the way its being done, yes, but there is an old raid that was released wing-by-wing
[9:29:45] TomatoPhalanges: if i remember right
[9:29:53] Hemysphere: when you get hit by kingsmorn it sends you down and leaves an add upstairs, if that add finishes its cast you die
[9:29:54] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: crown peach is dangerous stuff
[9:29:57] MrGattz: @Sollice scarlet crusader new class confirmed towPog
[9:29:59] Tendag: for real though he must know what 10.0 is, he said it will be amazing
[9:29:59] ZakuzaGB: shots are for those special occasions
[9:30:01] KawaXIV: @KawaXIV thats cool thanks for answering the questions, i look forward to watching it, the last one was good fun to watch too :)
[9:30:12] psycho_scythe: So no more sock on head? TableHere ScaredyCat
[9:30:25] Sollice: @MrGattz Queen Whitemane :)
[9:30:58] Molvonos: @MrGattz The original step-on-me mommy
[9:31:16] MrGattz: @Tendag yeah i mean we "know" just like we know what the wow mobile game is. its under like nda and shit and most of what is known is like developer to media notes. nothing big.
[9:31:53] FUBARtastic: dps check? or is something just not bieng done right
[9:32:09] Tendag: @MrGattz hm k
[9:32:24] KawaXIV: what is this content we're watching right now?
[9:32:54] AmericanFat: wtf towelliee without glasses looks like a different person
[9:33:01] TomatoPhalanges: testing of the 8th boss in mythic difficulty @KawaXIV
[9:33:09] KawaXIV: does that mean this is the PTR then?
[9:33:09] danimoto10: tomorrow you going normal?
[9:33:18] TomatoPhalanges: yep
[9:33:24] KawaXIV: I see I see
[9:33:34] danimoto10: oh snapp
[9:33:39] lalelusa: his voice sounds way off. I get that he's under the Jailer's control, but still
[9:34:17] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: what if you get the timewalking mount before the 24h is over?
[9:34:19] blacksheep806: LUL
[9:35:17] AmericanFat: @Towelliee is this PTR ? or live boss ?
[9:35:33] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: you watching the nfl games this weekend?
[9:35:37] jeffnsteff2019: PTR
[9:35:51] Daggerstry: Manduin?!
[9:36:04] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: should be some good games
[9:36:21] Daggerstry: The Jailer's Domination magic made him taller
[9:36:22] lalelusa: Evildin, then?
[9:36:23] AmericanFat: they even made the platform where he fights look like its the Lich King zone
[9:36:24] MohammedAIi: hows the raid so far
[9:36:27] BigLazyBob: How about Manduin?
[9:36:29] azumai_xyz: arthus from wish
[9:36:45] Laazerouss: anduin? more like poopy smelly
[9:37:07] Doomei_TV: Maduin
[9:37:33] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: U2
[9:37:37] AmericanFat: chat, does the alliance have a royal blood member to lead stormwind, if manduin dies? By the lore ?
[9:37:40] Shrenko: this UI has so much going on
[9:38:02] KawaXIV: so ptr versions of fights are kinda like cut down or are missing things that have yet to be implemented in their future release versions right?
[9:38:15] KawaXIV: like what can be learned from this is somewhat limited?
[9:39:04] KawaXIV: oh
[9:39:21] KawaXIV: i thought i heard ptr fights are supposed to be missing a lot of mechanics and stuff
[9:39:33] KawaXIV: maybe i misunderstood or heard something misleading
