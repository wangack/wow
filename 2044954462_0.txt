[4:54:11] Venusto1se: sl had more problems than just covid lack resource. it was so thin on content it was transparent
[4:54:21] Tevish80: @LeoNoComply I agree, did not like BFA either.
[4:54:31] odin_borsons_backpack: what was the expansion with the corruptions? a beam of shadow would just 1 shot
[4:54:46] qda__: beginning of bfa was dope and then it was shit until the last patch
[4:54:49] Griveouz: BFA
[4:55:19] milfspice: sup fandy
[4:55:19] kalviksen98: Only the start was bad
[4:55:27] antony_aj7: kos
[4:55:28] Mavrada: i enjoyed BFA but at the end having 5 sets of gear cause of corruptions/azerite traits got weird
[4:55:31] bran917: do you only play wow?
[4:55:32] faxity2k: Shadowlands is the worst
[4:55:32] Tevish80: I didn't like BFA. Had potential, just sucked IMO.
[4:55:33] Uber_Driver: Loved Twilight Dev as a tank during BFA.
[4:55:35] odin_borsons_backpack: I watch a lot of daily highlight vids for wow and seeing the corruptions 1 shot in arena was great
[4:55:36] lilyosa: s4 was my fav for sure
[4:55:42] Venusto1se: I miss BFA style cinematic cutscene
[4:55:52] qda__: the beginning was awesome while leveling if you had war mode on
[4:55:55] odin_borsons_backpack: @Uber_Driver was twilight dev the big beam from the sky?

[4:56:20] odin_borsons_backpack: Twilight devastation would be a good metal song
