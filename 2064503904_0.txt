[0:06:26] GreenArrowed: DEEP

[0:06:43] SepTiaTheNerd: The crafting of it all.

[0:07:23] cashthb: sup, lookin' arena world champion ship
[0:07:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Good morning folks!
[0:07:40] anker_jym: I can usually tell when you've raised, because your game music is off the next morning <3
[0:07:46] anker_jym: Raided even
[0:08:03] cupcakechaos013: hello! canâ€™t stay because Iâ€™m actually getting out of the house and doing something today. good luck with solo shuffle
[0:08:09] megthemage: Hi Hazel and chat!! VirtualHug
[0:08:12] vikutoru11: good afternoon, Hazel
[0:08:40] anker_jym: Hopefully that wasn't a callout, I find it funny that it's consistent lol
[0:08:55] vikutoru11: I got approved on a big test to become a lawyer here in Brazil and wanted to share with you hazelWave naguuraClap

[0:10:16] cashthb: focus jimi hendrix
[0:10:18] vikutoru11: @GreenArrowed @Zehantig naguuraLove
[0:10:38] Atomicpanda: doing my 30+ crown chemicals right now too
[0:10:59] megthemage: Thank you for the crown chemical reminder lol
[0:11:35] saga_no: I logged into the game for the first time since before Christmas just before stream started. Instant overwhelm. Whoo boi howdy..... X.x
[0:11:39] little_c2222: If one wanted to get the viscous mount do they need pvp gear?
[0:11:39] Zuldak: woo rating tanking
[0:11:47] kynlaeh: is solo shuffle fast with percentage? I have not really done much shuffle but i might consider if it is decent
[0:11:54] megthemage: @saga_no wb to the game saga!!
[0:11:56] neimoose2: good morning all you beautiful people!
[0:12:00] saga_no: But I did finally roll the Draenei Warlock I've been talking about for ages.... lmao
[0:12:24] Atomicpanda: "nerf DH" should just be considered a meme at this point
[0:12:26] Zuldak: thats basically wow pvp at the moment. There are like 2 dozen people and half are just lurking
[0:12:35] anker_jym: Oh dear, not the forums!
[0:12:37] neimoose2: I love that for themðŸ˜‚
[0:12:38] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Hehe, yeah, there's been a surprising amount of content added!
[0:12:45] saga_no: @megthemage It'll take me a while to get back into it; I just logged in to make the new char, really.. and then logged into my main to see if there was anything in particular I would get into.... which there was
[0:12:50] kynlaeh: ok i will stick with my RBGs then lol
[0:13:15] megthemage: @saga_no best feeling ever lol
[0:13:16] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 My spicy brain didn't like it LUL Logged out again to catch stream
[0:13:18] cashthb: lifehack: you don't need an invite if you have a gun
[0:13:18] kynlaeh: i think for solo shuffle you have to be at what 473?
[0:13:25] little_c2222: Ok how does one get pvp gear quickly?
[0:13:35] vikutoru11: do I have a chance to the love rocket mount in every alt daily?
[0:14:27] Blloood: @HazelNuttyGames do you know what the pirate patch is? or do you have a good guess?
[0:14:34] little_c2222: So battleground with pve gear first
[0:14:46] abadox09: what if youâ€™re scared and will run but want to get honor anyway
[0:14:50] bustykrabb: good morning from chicago, hazel and chat!
[0:14:57] InfiniFiasco: draenei warlock with the man'ari eredar skin is so cool
[0:14:57] Atomicpanda: got the saddle yet?
[0:15:01] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no Do a relaxing Superbloom on a character or two to ease back into it. Easy loot, and very mindless.
[0:15:15] Blloood: I think you should guess incase ur right
[0:15:17] Ryok: tomorrow i will finally get the last toy from this holiday yagaH i haven't interacted with any holiday event in like 6 years or so toy wise so i had a LOT to catch up on xD
[0:15:18] GaryNec: how does saddle look
[0:15:24] megthemage: Heehee now I'm thinking about busty crabs
[0:15:27] CodusXIII: CodusXIII is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to HazelNuttyGames's community! They've gifted a total of 15 in the channel!

[0:15:27] CodusXIII: CodusXIII gifted a Tier 1 sub to anker_jym! 
[0:15:36] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 I picked up all the quests available to me in Valdrakken on my main and figure I'll tinker with that... maybe.
[0:15:47] goplacidly56: Good morning, have an appointment so I can't watch but will watch later. Have a great day. Good luck with mount grind.
[0:15:55] cashthb: epic bgs are far and away the best way, the quests reset each season, you do 2 of them and it's like 2k honor and like 500 conquest even without the normal gain
[0:15:58] saga_no: I'll have to re-learn to play s-priest after this unintended hiatus from the game too, so there is that...
[0:16:05] vharakh_17: how do you track battle mender achievement again?
[0:16:07] anker_jym: Yoooo, thanks for the gift sub, Codus!!
[0:16:14] abadox09: thanks cast
[0:16:19] Atomicpanda: crazy that the saddle has a lower drop rate than the rocket.
[0:16:29] anker_jym: anker_jym watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:16:37] vharakh_17: Thank you!
[0:16:47] vharakh_17: good luck on the SS grind <3
[0:16:51] Atomicpanda: no the love in the air saddle
[0:17:00] little_c2222: Which selection is battlegrounds? There are so many options.
[0:17:22] Marmoh: I need wow to add a class that's 99% passives and one button to click
[0:17:44] vikutoru11: @Marmoh LUL
[0:17:47] abadox09: lol
[0:17:51] abadox09: totally agree
[0:18:06] tootodilee: tysm for the gifted codus <3
[0:18:07] Zuldak: seeing odd specs means either they have no idea what they are doing or they are a one tick about to school people
[0:18:08] cashthb: @little_c2222 random bg / random epic bg on the unranked tab
[0:18:13] saga_no: Oh I plan on being the biggest clown when I start rockin' up to Solo Shuffle
[0:18:19] anker_jym: WoW Classic Frost Mage lol. Frostbolt spam
[0:18:25] saga_no: as in the most ridiculous mog ever to distract from my awful playing
[0:18:31] ahrs1988: you should do a transmog competition!
[0:18:34] Zuldak: Chef Naoimi cookie clicker
[0:18:34] abadox09: I wish WoW had a card game like final fantasy has.
[0:18:43] little_c2222: Like the games at the dark moon fair behind the roller-coaster?
[0:18:43] ahrs1988: ahrs1988 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:18:43] Streamlabs: ahrs1988 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:18:52] Zuldak: or whatever that pandaran chef who burned everything in legion was
[0:19:42] abadox09: oh thereâ€™s a card game back there? I should go take a look
[0:20:09] abadox09: Iâ€™ve never really explored the dark moon fair
[0:20:20] little_c2222: Not card game but their mini games
[0:21:34] little_c2222: Maybe just 1 game. The jewel match one.
[0:21:51] little_c2222: It's been awhile
[0:22:28] Ujai321: Morning
[0:23:22] Ujai321: Happy Friday to you too
[0:23:23] little_c2222: LUL
[0:23:29] jack_fraust: Good Morning Hazel!!!!! always a pleasure dear
[0:23:40] ramzie0: ramzie0 watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:24:00] TotallyNotRaien: not tilted, just slightly crooked
[0:24:36] eziekiyah: this is my favorite music in the whole game
[0:24:37] Ujai321: Good thing that I know nothing about PVP, and especially not PVP healing
[0:24:47] little_c2222: I don't know how you play wow, read chat, and respond with appropriate conversation all at the same time.
[0:25:14] Ujai321: Years of Practice
[0:25:22] jack_fraust: just practice
[0:25:27] jack_fraust: see
[0:25:47] lilhunbun: hi hazel!
[0:26:33] jack_fraust: been playing for 18 years and my first two years I spent looking at the action bar and moused it to death bc i cldnt use the keys well yet lol
[0:26:35] Marmoh: Is the immunity on tranquility more impactful than the heal?
[0:27:01] cashthb: ...here I come complaining healing being too strong again...
[0:27:22] Zehantig: don't thread on us healers, we'll literally cry
[0:28:34] lykynn: morning all
[0:28:58] jack_fraust: Hazel I know your super busy right now but i looked and cldnt find any video's on Nightbane did u make one for him?
[0:29:15] jack_fraust: Karazan
[0:29:20] cashthb: kara dragon
[0:29:25] jack_fraust: bone dragon
[0:29:43] GreenArrowed: there must be a guide on wowhead
[0:29:49] jack_fraust: k ty back to research
[0:30:16] Ujai321: What do you need the guide for? Is it current content somewhere?
[0:30:20] jack_fraust: there r but you hv to sift through everyone's BS about this tht or the other and never the point
[0:30:33] jack_fraust: no
[0:30:39] jack_fraust: its old old
[0:31:00] jack_fraust: that dragon is a series of quests to do to be able to summon him to spawn
[0:31:17] jack_fraust: he drops some of the rarest gear inn game
[0:31:25] jack_fraust: the shield to be specific
[0:31:39] Ujai321: Ah, so you need a guide to summon him, not to kill it?
[0:31:41] Leterius: You ll be able to do it. It is not really hard as far as I remember)
[0:31:56] jack_fraust: Shield of Impenitrable Darkness
[0:32:26] jack_fraust: theres a few missing pieces of the puzzle in the questline i cnt find
[0:32:36] jack_fraust: its new Kareazan
[0:32:41] jack_fraust: "
[0:32:47] jack_fraust: upper entrance
[0:33:09] nickvandam1980: hey gorgeous HeyGuys
[0:34:44] Zehantig: mistweavers and resto druids are the most annoying healers to play against if they're focusing on CCs
[0:35:03] Zuldak: we all agree demon hunters are stupid and should be slapped in the face with the nerf bat right?
[0:35:07] Ujai321: Do you want to hear something to worry about?
[0:36:33] jack_fraust: @Zuldak its not the damage they do that's not that bad, its their broken ability as tanks!!
[0:36:34] nickvandam1980: LOLZ!
[0:36:35] Ryok: @Zuldak hell no D: i main havoc
[0:36:40] Ujai321: That is obviously not a helpful way to think about that question Kappa
[0:37:12] Ujai321: Can you do business with your bank over phone?
[0:37:15] kynlaeh: hazel I just made some homemade egg drop soup!
[0:37:15] jack_fraust: I've seen more ridiculous pulls by them and servived than any other class
[0:37:40] Zuldak: are you going to suggest AI @Ujai321 ?
[0:37:41] nickvandam1980: firemage... blow up inc... -_-
[0:38:00] Ujai321: I am @zuldak
[0:38:14] Zuldak: yeah i saw they got a new version of AI and its even better
[0:38:26] Zuldak: it made a video of a bird and it looked almost perfect
[0:38:46] 7thSaga: simplyLurk Hellure Hazel and Chat!
[0:38:55] denk21345: how much time you reckon you spend on a saddle?
[0:38:59] jack_fraust: I can't wait till our hero talents go into effect!!!
[0:39:13] Ujai321: Saw a clip of a streamer today explicitly instructing the bank to only do anything when he was present in person, because there is thousands of hours of his voice on the Internet, and it can easily be forged
[0:39:44] Ujai321: I thought that was interesting
[0:39:59] saga_no: I assume he made this request in person at his bank?
[0:40:18] Ujai321: He did ^^
[0:40:25] 7thSaga: 7thSaga watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:40:37] jack_fraust: WAAAAAAA
[0:40:51] saga_no: coffee-break - brb
[0:40:58] GreenArrowed: yea i'm not happy about it
[0:41:23] GreenArrowed: i manage trust & safety teams at my job and we're worried about the misuse possibilities
[0:41:48] emerald27x: does anyone know the number of people who still play wow? I know itâ€™s sadly decreased
[0:42:09] cashthb: yeah, if it's soo good can it name that kanye & jay-z song that's a bout pairs
[0:42:14] nickvandam1980: i love it wen a ret pala knows what to do :D
[0:42:16] 7thSaga: got me some TGI Fridays Potato Skins Kreygasm
[0:42:24] cashthb: *about paris
[0:42:56] jack_fraust: according to the internet there is still a staggering 5.6 mil playing
[0:43:12] jack_fraust: as of 2023
[0:43:13] Ujai321: Nobody knows exactly @emerald27x , they don't post these numbers anymore
[0:43:35] emerald27x: I wonder why
[0:43:39] GreenArrowed: yup
[0:43:48] Zuldak: they would need like ID numbers and stuff
[0:43:48] jack_fraust: the number increased substantially with the succeess of DF
[0:44:03] Zuldak: you would also need to know the bank account numbers
[0:44:24] Zuldak: like the teller on the phone wouldnt know your voice anyway
[0:44:30] jack_fraust: A NIGHTMARE!!!
[0:44:49] GreenArrowed: i got a new phone/number a few months ago, it was easier to change my 2 factor on my bank than it was on bnet
[0:44:53] GreenArrowed: and that didn't feel great
[0:45:06] Zuldak: there already is a spoof german speaking hazel i think
[0:45:09] Zuldak: on youtube
[0:45:16] jack_fraust: lolollololololololo
[0:45:33] 7thSaga: Hey you won 10,000 dollars from a prince need info to send it to LUL
[0:45:45] Zuldak: a positive use of spoofing hazel's voice: you could add her to the game to voice act
[0:45:45] Ujai321: That couldn't happen to you. Everybody knows you wouldn't call anybody
[0:46:05] cashthb: speaking of contest, I still didn't recieve that tesla I won in your official telegram... I mean, I still don't have a licence but still
[0:46:30] Zuldak: Don't worry, i just sent 5,000 dollars to a nigerian prince who will give me mllions once his bank fees are cleared
[0:46:47] Zuldak: Kappa
[0:46:54] Zacewing: there was a big thing in the FFXIV community a while back where people were impersonating popular streamers to conduct phishing scams
[0:46:58] Ujai321: That's such a good deal!
[0:47:07] cashthb: @Zuldak but nigeria is not monarchy
[0:47:30] GreenArrowed: AI still need human trainers, so it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be
[0:47:31] cashthb: no way it won't be regulated
[0:47:42] little_c2222: If it sounds too good to be true, it is
[0:47:46] little_c2222: Play wow
[0:47:57] Zuldak: The thing is that people who actually work on and create 'smart' devices don't want anything smart in their home and i think they keep a firearm next to the printer in case it starts making noises
[0:48:15] jack_fraust: jack_fraust subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:48:15] Streamlabs: jack_fraust just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:48:21] Atomicpanda: they never think about where their profits are gonna come from once they're done killing us.
[0:49:18] cashthb: @Zuldak can confirm... kinda, I was fine with smart devices, simple web user tracking put me over the edge
[0:49:26] smashenater: hello everyone GunRun
[0:49:35] jack_fraust: Sorry Hazel should have subbed a month ago when I discovered you as one of the greatest hidden treasures discovered in wow
[0:50:37] GreenArrowed: it still needs human manipulation
[0:50:53] saga_no: ....aaaand back
[0:50:54] anker_jym: I'm an old man when it comes to AI. AI does not belong in any form of art. Period.
[0:51:05] heldtheline: character ai (a fandom ai chatbot site) was super popular over the summer but its popularity seemed to have dropped off a bit.
[0:51:11] GreenArrowed: i use it to outline a lot
[0:51:20] NamiWhami: I train LLMs for work, and their knowledge bases are weirdly specific and good at top-end things, but regularly fail at basic math and simple knowledge.
[0:51:47] cashthb: chatgpt almost replaced google for my work, sure creative jobs are safe... but there are very few creative jobs
[0:51:58] GreenArrowed: yea that's how i use it
[0:52:15] GreenArrowed: i also train llms for customer service chatbots and it takes A LOT of work to make them truly conversational
[0:52:26] wolfcloudchaser80: Copilot helps with troubleshooting, too. Helped me fix a controller connection issue.
[0:53:02] saga_no: The most fascinating thing re: AI for me at present is knowing it's mostly trained by neurotypical people, and how weirdly implicit some of the output therefore can be
[0:53:14] jack_fraust: thats exactly what it was designed for but like anything else mankind invented thee those ppl tht just want to watch the world burn and take what we create and use it for bad
[0:53:34] NamiWhami: @greenarrowed ours hasnâ€™t done customer service in a while, but thatâ€™s also very true. so many rounds of sft and rlhf and they still kinda suck
[0:53:45] Atomicpanda: they want to take our jobs away with AI and pay us as little as possible for whatever jobs are left and somehow they expect us to somehow still be able to buy their products.
[0:54:01] jack_fraust: its the same as cloning, your playing God at some point and thats alll bad
[0:54:24] GreenArrowed: @NamiWhami i spent 10 hrs a week training ours to keep it running smoothly
[0:54:37] jack_fraust: if we were just going to replace someones arm or leg or bad organ thatwould be amazing but ppl want to clone ppl and that sbad
[0:54:41] smashenater: old monkdonalds doing work there
[0:55:40] Atomicpanda: AI, not even once.
[0:55:44] cashthb: but that's a lame felty ai, have tried asking Grok?
[0:55:52] smashenater: do you plan to watch mdi this weekend Hazel?
[0:56:08] jack_fraust: As a technology expert with schooling and experience I believe we are getting to far ahead of ourselves
[0:56:15] AmiYuy: AmiYuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! hazelLove hazelLove hazelLove
[0:56:15] Streamlabs: amiyuy just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:56:29] jack_fraust: and movies were AI takes over has actully become a real thing
[0:56:40] jack_fraust: a real poosibiliity
[0:56:40] sence_00: haha that is also me while in Q "should i be here? maybe I'll unQ...maybe one more?"
[0:57:12] jack_fraust: I DIDNT SEE THE 12 MNTH SUB AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[0:57:28] jack_fraust: now i hv to double up thts it
[0:57:30] witchhobbit: ooo hello we're talking about AI?
[0:57:33] jack_fraust: lolo
[0:57:44] kynlaeh: i asked copilot what games you play and it told me ESO, WoW and final fantasy so idk where it got that lol
[0:58:01] saga_no: I think ... I will ease my way back in the game by leveling up a PvP toon (...priest cuz that's what I like) and like... make PvP my 2024 personal goal
[0:58:09] cashthb: flatout 2?
[0:58:25] anker_jym: Put Pepe on your head for extra Shuffle luck. Scientifically proven to work sometimes, 100% of the time!
[0:58:31] witchhobbit: i saw you had a couple streams of FF, did you ever play more outside of that? lol
[0:58:57] smashenater: I don't think I'll raid fated season, so I'm looking for another game to play alongside m+. Is there a game that has similar playstlye to m+ dungeons ?
[0:59:06] kynlaeh: i told it tell me more after that and it said the Witcher series and Dragon age
[0:59:18] Atomicpanda: that's the other problem. AI just makes stuff up. and then that gets spread around to other AI. few years and facts will be dead.
[0:59:22] saga_no: Does anyone know if the Follower dungeons also works for leveling dungeons?
[0:59:49] anker_jym: Hazel, this is probably one of the most important pop culture questions you'll be asked: Star Wars or Star Trek?
[0:59:52] GreenArrowed: @saga_no i think so!
[0:59:54] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no I think it does, I've seen it as an option as a sub-70, but I don't think you get as much exp.
[0:59:58] cashthb: you don't know what I am doing
[1:00:08] jack_fraust: maybe cause it knows your BANANAS!!! lolollolol
[1:00:08] heldtheline: maybe it was trying to tell you that you needed potassium, in a sneaky ai way
[1:00:12] cashthb: @saga_no 60+
[1:00:19] witchhobbit: i wanted to like FF but i found their account site horrible and i could barely get thru the starting experience haha. got to the first few ladybug killing quests and then i was out of game time
[1:00:19] little_c2222: Your talking about bananas now, doe that count?
[1:00:20] GreenArrowed: my friend just texted me to ask how i was doing with palworld, and he was so concerned that he called me to ask if i've come up for air. so that's where i am.
[1:00:21] Atomicpanda: just take a picture
[1:00:26] wolfcloudchaser80: Wait, copilot can do AI art, too?
[1:00:40] jack_fraust: yes
[1:00:43] Deevo_Twitch: When the next expansion?
[1:00:43] saga_no: So... from lvl10 to 60 I'm still stuck playing with other humans if I do dungeons? lame..
[1:00:44] watchCrimson: good "insert your current time of the day" eversone, hope you are all having a great day so far ^^
[1:01:06] jack_fraust: Augish i thnk
[1:01:47] cashthb: @saga_no might be a great oportunity to try yourself at healing, they are really easy
[1:01:52] jack_fraust: I think WOW will do a huge release thing with their 20 year Bday this year
[1:02:03] witchhobbit: ran out of game time because by the time i wrecked havoc with the ff account site the 2nd time i tried playing it was the last free game time i had
[1:02:13] jack_fraust: no def release date as of yet
[1:02:14] saga_no: @cashthb I would... if I could do follower dungeons while leveling from lvl10.... not if I'm playing wiht other humans.
[1:03:00] jack_fraust: ]the follower dungeon is one of the most brilliant things wow has done yet
[1:03:13] saga_no: Same goes for tanking. I would if I could do it from lvl10 with bots - not with other humans.
[1:03:19] jack_fraust: not regularly
[1:03:21] vharakh_17: i haven't even tried 1 yet
[1:03:23] Leterius: Ð¨ Ñ€Ñ„Ð¼Ñƒ Ñ‚ÑƒÐ¼ÑƒÐº Ð²Ñ‰Ñ‚Ñƒ Ñ‰Ñ‚Ñƒ ÐºÐ¸Ñ€
[1:03:24] cashthb: never did one
[1:03:29] Leterius: I have never done one tbh*
[1:03:42] saga_no: I haven't tried them yet - I was hoping I could power-level the to-be PvP toon with them - but apparently not until I ding 60
[1:03:42] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm using them to casually try for the Breath of Ohnara
[1:03:48] bonggolong: i have no idea what they are yet xD
[1:03:55] witchhobbit: i keep forgetting to try one!! i mostly wanted to do one for the tuskarr dungeon toy
[1:04:04] anker_jym: I did one Brackenhide follower dungeon. It took so much longer than a normal dungeon with people
[1:04:12] watchCrimson: I know it's already too late for that, but what would you think if they were to introduce new specs in shadowlands by using ghosts of significant spec related dead people who were using unusual styles, like time mages and elisande, none for druids, they arÄºready have 4
[1:04:17] witchhobbit: but i'm def interested in trying it out when i'm 60 on new tank specs
[1:04:29] jack_fraust: but I run into new ppl all the time and so lost asking for help and nobody responds so I help and show rthem
[1:04:45] jack_fraust: yes they are slow bc thats their intentions
[1:04:53] saga_no: I wouldn't mind them being slow - but I want them from lvl10 ...so....... there is that
[1:05:12] jack_fraust: how many times did you get into a dungeon as a young player and get left behind bc they power through it
[1:05:19] heldtheline: I wonder if follower dungeons are geared more towards the people who would never do dungeons with real people (like me) so the slowness isn't really that important
[1:05:31] bustykrabb: still holding out for a necromancer class/spec. know it's mostly covered with DK/lock, but a girl can dream
[1:05:37] ghostie1995: I did halls of infusion on a leveling warrior and I kept dying somehow it took way too long so I left
[1:06:00] jack_fraust: now you can go through and actually learn the fights, mechanics etc. and become a better player because of it
[1:06:08] wolfcloudchaser80: @saga_no I think only the base Dragonflight dungeons are follower-enabled, so you'd be doing the same handful a LOT of times to level that far.
[1:06:09] Ryok: @saga_no i think that happens in TWW no merodyHmm because they said DF will become the new "new player" expansion so i would hope the dungeons become level 10 dungeons
[1:06:11] witchhobbit: i have been having some bad experiences trying out new tank specs for the first time. so, wish the follower dungeons were ready for low levels
[1:06:22] cashthb: me too! ... i just wanna tank... or heal... or anything that's not sitting in a que for an hour
[1:06:41] wolfcloudchaser80: But the followers (usually) aren't broken or idiots, surprisingly.
[1:06:47] anker_jym: Holy cow, a Worgen blood Mage would be sick!! A vampire AND a werewolf
[1:07:02] watchCrimson: I was thinking the blood mage would be for lock, as there was an NPC using an bloodorb in legion they dealt with in their legion orderhall questline
[1:07:09] jack_fraust: the best part is if you have absolutley no idea what your doing you can have the NPC guide you through
[1:07:14] Zuldak: The infinite dragonflight colors for the drakes are under used
[1:07:26] razorofwow: razorofwow subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! hello
[1:07:26] Streamlabs: razorofwow just subscribed with Tier 2!
[1:07:38] saga_no: @Ryok I hope so...
[1:07:42] razorofwow: KappaHD I Woke up
[1:07:49] vharakh_17: cyclone at 0.8% XD im sure that priest was mashing void swap hoping it would work
[1:08:31] saga_no: Thankfully, speedrun-leveling a priest is pretty easy - even without dungeons
[1:08:35] brandymt14: have you tried palworld?
[1:08:47] jack_fraust: Ok Hazel finished my coffee and logging in to get serious have a blessed and wonderful day see you next time
[1:08:57] Leterius: @Zuldak I use them since I unlocked em, like em way more than regular black
[1:09:00] jack_fraust: and your a GEM!!!!!!!
[1:09:03] BoogiePonderosa: hi
[1:09:49] saga_no: My plan is to attempt PvP as Shadow - but because it is a priest I have the *option* to swap to healing specs should I somehow get cocky enough for that
[1:10:11] witchhobbit: that reminds me to run more heroic dawn of the infinites to get all the manuscripts
[1:10:14] LesterOfSmeg2: Hi Neighbor love all the wigs
[1:10:19] professor_of_math_harvard: heyyy :)
[1:10:23] witchhobbit: i have never gotten one in keys
[1:10:26] eielwind: i like farming in between dps pvp queues
[1:10:30] professor_of_math_harvard: can you please tell my sister nel happy birthday? :P
[1:10:35] saga_no: I'm more used to DPS queues in general so that part doesn't bother me
[1:10:35] anker_jym: Have you heard of the Palworld clone that Nintendo has
[1:10:35] GreenArrowed: i love queuing as dps just bc i like doing stuff in between
[1:10:37] Zuldak: @Leterius yeah i use it on my slither noodle dragon. Looks sharp
[1:10:38] BoogiePonderosa: got aotc last nite!
[1:10:46] Leterius: which ilvl does dawn of the infinites M0 drop atm?
[1:10:51] anker_jym: Think it's called Pokemans or something like that
[1:11:28] BoogiePonderosa: thanks! :)
[1:11:54] saga_no: I could "cheat" and realm-transfer a lvl70 priest I have with OK gear and just pump that through PvP - but I think the smarter route is to level a fresh toon
[1:12:01] ramzie0: I managed to finagle a free AOTC carry from a friends guild. They wiped a few times, but hey, free's free. haha
[1:13:40] witchhobbit: i would love to see a similar system with vicious mounts implemented for the mythics+ mounts
[1:14:17] professor_of_math_harvard: hehe ^_^
[1:14:59] lilhunbun: hi hazel!!
[1:15:13] Yenma57: how do you not go with the elite yellow/white set as druid... its the best hands down
[1:15:35] witchhobbit: ooo yes i love that combo lol
[1:16:41] RTSLightning: oh man, can I still get that skirt?
[1:16:46] witchhobbit: mog is becoming so important to me i wanna collect more. the mog collecting itch is very itchy lately
[1:16:56] witchhobbit: the itch can't wait for war within anymore
[1:17:25] professor_of_math_harvard: wow i didn't know about that skirt, i'm gonna buy it right now! ^_^
[1:17:54] lilhunbun: is that set different from the one you get for the traveler's log?
[1:18:31] witchhobbit: @lilhunbun just the color
[1:18:49] saga_no: I like the Murloc backpacks ;P
[1:19:12] lilhunbun: oh okay so the dark one is only available to purchase through the shop? @haleych
[1:19:41] watchCrimson: maybe black dragon wings from special gradonflight edition?
[1:19:43] witchhobbit: @lilhunbun yes atm but in the footnote it says it will arrive in a future trading post
[1:20:13] anker_jym: You will now win the next 3 Shuffles. Transmog meta
[1:20:43] cashthb: white could work
[1:20:45] watchCrimson: eggplant > magenta, also its the vÂ´best imho
[1:21:03] witchhobbit: very cute
[1:21:15] witchhobbit: the only way to win pvp
[1:21:20] heldtheline: it's almost unfortunate that you aren't dps; 'cause you slay hazelTen
[1:21:31] saga_no: I'm gonna need to up my mog-collecting game to get more silly outfits for future PvP LUL
[1:21:39] GreenArrowed: so much stealth
[1:22:03] cashthb: now that's a round I approve of
[1:22:03] watchCrimson: WOW: we are in dire need of tanks for hero dungs also WOW: now wait for healer like 20 mins
[1:22:13] lilhunbun: neighbors be jealous
[1:22:37] saga_no: I think my neighbors have settled on the fact that I will look like an absolute clown no matter what - so ... they're fine with seeing me in a bright yellow Pikachu onesie
[1:22:39] lilhunbun: loool
[1:22:46] witchhobbit: i have always felt uncomfortable in dresses and skirts but MAXI dresses and skirts? thats the way to go
[1:22:49] CommanderCOOL: im new to wow, do you get multiple color options of armor or clothes when you first unlock them. or do you have to buy color sets?
[1:23:08] cashthb: would have made that joke if I could have
[1:23:15] wolfcloudchaser80: Such a ripe opportunity to mess with people.... invent some silly, non-existent job.
[1:23:39] dicemeister23: how bad is the ancient salamanther grind?
[1:23:44] cashthb: yeah
[1:23:47] watchCrimson: my neighbors are slowly getting use to that I am a shuting mess, some still have complaints
[1:24:04] witchhobbit: @CommanderCOOL not every set, but a lot of the newer sets they are making for the shop/trading post has diff colors
[1:24:51] saga_no: tbf, my old neighbors watched me play PokÃ©monGO in said bright yellow Pikachu onesie with the neighborhood kids ...so they're mostly just on board with me being the weird Auntie on the block
[1:25:01] witchhobbit: @CommanderCOOL and then for raid and outdoor sets, there is a diff color for each level or version of outdoor content
[1:25:24] CommanderCOOL: @haleych so if i get a piece that blue and gold, i can go to the shop for like red and black on the same piece
[1:25:30] saga_no: (The kids thought it was cool that a random adult in their apartment complex would willingly dress like Pikachu for their entertainment)
[1:25:34] watchCrimson: I got lucky and got ivory cloud serpent today
[1:25:55] watchCrimson: met a nice danish guy in the proces as we waited together
[1:26:29] Neltalie: danish wow players are so nice
[1:26:38] GreenArrowed: good
[1:26:42] Neltalie: 95% of the time :D
[1:26:42] CommanderCOOL: @haleych different color for each level sounds cool for collecting
[1:26:43] GreenArrowed: love it
[1:26:50] witchhobbit: @CommanderCOOL it really varies on content and where the armor is from. the trading post CAN have multiple colors of a piece but not always. they often release diff colors every month
[1:27:11] watchCrimson: I love bees in wow, so BFA was a nice addition for me
[1:27:18] CommanderCOOL: ohhh okay
[1:27:21] averageteacup: I called my bee pet Barry .. from Bee Movie :D
[1:27:35] Neltalie: pee pet hahah
[1:27:43] witchhobbit: @CommanderCOOL so this month for the trading post it was pink/red themed. last month was all gold/yellow
[1:27:55] GreenArrowed: it's been so so windy here
[1:27:58] EverNever1564: what rating
[1:28:06] watchCrimson: oh yeah, bumbles, I am behind on the daylies for him
[1:28:07] GreenArrowed: the wind ripped my window open last night and i couldn't figure out what i was so cold
[1:28:11] watchCrimson: brb
[1:28:23] MaddiDJ4: here in the Midwest we call the fools spring. we just had a week of it. but this morning it was super windy and snowing
[1:28:29] CommanderCOOL: @haleych if you miss thats month cycle, do they bring it back?
[1:28:32] anker_jym: That would be fantastic, ngl
[1:28:54] Neltalie: would love to watch that :D
[1:28:59] cashthb: well it wouldn't be worse than squishmallow convesations
[1:29:04] mockspiral: only reason priest is catching that burst is life swap ðŸ«£
[1:29:15] saga_no: As someone who has moderated for IRL-streamers in the past ...there really isn't much more to it
[1:29:22] Neltalie: how about doing it as a youtube video
[1:29:38] saga_no: Some do. But you don't need all that - really
[1:30:01] MaddiDJ4: hazels home videos fishing edition?
[1:30:13] witchhobbit: @CommanderCOOL yes!! but there isn't a good idea on how to tell when it could, i don't think anyone has a solid idea on the rotation yet since it's new
[1:30:16] saga_no: (The quality difference isn't THAT noticeable - at least not the ones I've moderated for / seen)
[1:30:26] watchCrimson: it's the double rough fight!!!!
[1:31:04] CommanderCOOL: @haleych ohhh ok. so get it while it hot lol
[1:31:08] eielwind: i never thought id hear hazel say "muscle dad nooo!"
[1:31:31] witchhobbit: @haleych we can guess that they will continue to do color themes though. especially for the months with the big holidays
[1:31:36] lumaday: my solo shuffle score is like a roller coaster track lol. i get so close to 1800 and then have some rough lobbies.
[1:32:48] CommanderCOOL: @haleych makes sense gotta be a pattern. thanks for the help
[1:32:52] dicemeister23: Wow, I just asked you how bad the ancient salamanther grind was, and someone killed pyrachniss with me and traded me the mount!
[1:33:09] witchhobbit: we are already seeing things rotate back in to the trading post so that's nice. at some point they may have less new stuff so we can all catch up, tho who knows
[1:33:12] watchCrimson: alright, bumbles 2/7 done
[1:33:19] witchhobbit: @CommanderCOOL np!
[1:33:25] wolfcloudchaser80: So maybe someone knows this: I've seen videos that list the confirmed mounts that are getting dynamic flight in the pre-patch, but is there a text list somewhere?
[1:34:02] HazelNuttyGames: https://www.wowhead.com/news/bringing-dragonriding-animations-to-more-old-world-mounts-in-patch-10-1-7-334145
[1:34:08] witchhobbit: ohh theres a confirmed list? i didnt know this!
[1:34:35] TotallyNotRaien: i just want flight form dynamic flying
[1:34:36] watchCrimson: shame wowhead didnt put up pictures of the mounts
[1:34:48] wolfcloudchaser80: Well dang, I thought I searched for exactly that, but there we go. Thanks!
[1:34:53] witchhobbit: it does make sense all the old dragon mounts lol
[1:35:47] cashthb: I'm soo salty Pinto doesn't get dynamic flight
[1:36:03] witchhobbit: lol
[1:36:05] anker_jym: I can't wait to Dragonride on Mim's Head lol....now if only I could get it to drop from Yogg....
[1:37:20] ramh3mi77: what addon do you have that changes the que pop sound?
[1:37:49] HazelNuttyGames: !addons
[1:37:49] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[1:37:54] witchhobbit: mudpack LUL
[1:38:19] cashthb: what's wrong with that name, sounds like a normal Jade Empire npc
[1:38:54] saga_no: So roughly how long would it take if you did nothing but Solo Shuffle to get the mount?
[1:39:06] saga_no: From zero % I mean
[1:39:23] witchhobbit: i'm more appreciating mudpack than pointing out anything wrong haha
[1:39:39] sence_00: it hurts you or heals you depending
[1:39:51] anker_jym: That new Faeline Stomp animation is so pretty!
[1:40:02] witchhobbit: i'm a gnome mage, i love other gnome mages sairaWiggle
[1:40:37] witchhobbit: yeah i loved the shadowlands spells but the updates are really nice to have lol
[1:40:52] cashthb: @saga_no depends on how much you win, btw prolly a really long time as a dps
[1:41:09] saga_no: Zero rating / zero %
[1:41:19] Leterius: I have a mechagnome mage. He s a walking stove
[1:41:48] witchhobbit: is it easier to be a healer or dps
[1:41:53] witchhobbit: in solo shuffle
[1:42:13] cashthb: lower ratings are worse in my experience, I was hammer of wrating half of my teams kills up to like 1500
[1:42:14] watchCrimson: do you think gift of N'zoth will do anything in the new expansion?
[1:42:15] sence_00: @saga_no fwiw I started at about the same time Hazel did and Im only slightly ahead in percent so...as a healer this seems pretty representative unless youre playing a ton
[1:43:20] saga_no: Cuz like - I can easily play like 5-6 hours per day - so if I only did Shuffle I would eventually get OK enough to at least get some progress on the mount bar
[1:43:23] sence_00: @watchCrimson man I hope so, my spriest is still wearing that eye on her head.
[1:44:09] saga_no: I don't foresee myself being able to get into 2s or 3s easily, so I'm assuming I'll work on the mount(s) through SHuffle
[1:44:33] cashthb: @saga_no I'd recommend to just ignore the mount and focus on getting good in your first season
[1:44:51] saga_no: @cashthb I choose to focus on the mount because I'll never get good
[1:45:12] saga_no: But I can play long enough to get the mount *eventually*
[1:45:32] Yenma57: when does the season end anyway?
[1:45:38] Perkolate: no flying mount til gladiator
[1:45:43] marbared: I tried follower dungeons yesterday. My followers basically tried to keep up and yell advice as I killed everything. They've obviously never run any M+s.
[1:45:46] sence_00: i think even if the season ends you can still fill the progress bar, its just hidden at that point or something
[1:45:55] saga_no: Oh there is no way I'll get the cute owlbear this season - my PvP toon is lvl1 ... LUL
[1:47:09] saga_no: I'm just hoping Blizz will put more Vicious Owlbear mounts in the game eventually
[1:47:23] cashthb: thing about the mount bar is that if you're not progressing it tells you you're not proressing which might be discouraging
[1:47:36] cashthb: @saga_no it gets on the vicious saddle vendor eventually
[1:48:00] saga_no: @cashthb Then I'll know I'm not progressing and not stress about progressing while I chip away at the bar *shrug*
[1:48:52] witchhobbit: have you ever gotten a vicious saddle more than once in a season?
[1:49:05] witchhobbit: sounds like a lot of pvp LUL
[1:49:07] saga_no: Ahh nice - cool..
[1:49:10] saga_no: then that will be a future goal
[1:49:24] saga_no: For 2024 - I'll just have "do PvP" as a general over-arching goal
[1:49:39] witchhobbit: @saga_no yeah that is a good thing about the vicious mounts. they're not real fomo
[1:49:51] jgbrit: Hi Hazel! How goes it?
[1:50:42] elliongrey: BAM
[1:51:09] sence_00: whooo %
[1:51:28] jgbrit: Oh she cute!
[1:51:49] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: hi
[1:53:52] kynlaeh: do you and partner play games together or do you guys have different game preferences?
[1:54:16] jgbrit: I met a random player today and ended up getting the achievement for 50 stacks of the love prism! Such a nice player
[1:54:21] anker_jym: But you topped the healing meters!
[1:54:23] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: how are you all
[1:54:43] comemorning: hi
[1:54:56] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: im good going to stream my first stream today
[1:55:27] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: kinda excited
[1:58:52] saga_no: That would indeed be quite the flex
[1:58:59] ramzie0: I want an Embody so bad but my wife won't let me buy one
[1:59:01] Ujai321: Does she still like the old IKEA chair?
[1:59:12] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: looks like my cat but mine fatt
[1:59:28] jgbrit: Lol, just bought my cat a Herman Miller for streaming... imagine LUL
[1:59:40] Ujai321: Because the worry with an extra Herman Miller chair would be the same with all the 13 cat beds you own
[2:00:01] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: lol
[2:00:08] Ujai321: Macatstic
[2:00:17] kynlaeh: my goal is to get my cats a catio when i get a home
[2:00:20] jgbrit: Was the cat ripped ðŸ˜‚
[2:00:21] kynlaeh: gotta get money first tho
[2:00:36] Ujai321: Also because it's warm, I assume
[2:00:46] Ujai321: I know nothing about cats
[2:00:47] anker_jym: I have some funny pictures of my old cat sitting next to a birdhouse. She was waiting for her prey to come to her lol
[2:01:07] dicemeister23: is there a way to track elemental bosses on forbidden reach?
[2:01:09] jgbrit: Imagine getting your cat a Herman Miller and your cat be like 'Nah', now that's a flex ðŸ˜‚
[2:01:11] dicemeister23: For the snail mount
[2:01:11] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: im gonna go eat. i followed you and hope  to watch you more you seem fun
[2:01:12] Ujai321: Does she sit on your PC?
[2:01:18] Ujai321: That one surely is warm
[2:01:31] Zuldak: you know who the underrated stars of DF are? Beef and Wellington
[2:01:57] Zuldak: They are the big frog guys who help during the siege of dragonbane keep
[2:02:02] ghostie1995: and their child mignon
[2:02:09] cashthb: that's Beef and he's a toad
[2:02:18] cashthb: not a snail
[2:02:20] Zuldak: The evil fire tribe kidnapped Beef and Wellington is coming to help save him
[2:02:35] jgbrit: Shadowlands is actually popping off at the moment. There's so many people there
[2:03:09] Ujai321: I wish there was a bug in solo shuffle where, just for a bit, you would lose the round if your hunter feign death'd
[2:03:28] Zuldak: renewal is one of my tricks to save myself when things get spicy in a key
[2:03:38] Zuldak: lot of druids seem to pass on it
[2:03:45] vharakh_17: @Ujai321 that would be tilting KEKW
[2:04:01] Ujai321: But also hilarious
[2:04:34] Zuldak: the druid class tree is a mess. I hate how you have to get 2 healing talents to grab cleanse
[2:05:17] anker_jym: Do any of your characters have a "home", as in, a place you park them to retire until the next expansion
[2:05:27] cashthb: I'd never go for a 30% heal instead of typhoon, I'm not a big druid tho
[2:06:38] watchCrimson: people of the internet, what is the most fun melee class/spec in the game for you and why?
[2:07:02] saga_no: @watchCrimson I like Paladin for the self-heals
[2:07:05] ramzie0: F?
[2:07:14] jgbrit: @watchcrimson Ret Paladin ALL day long
[2:07:17] vharakh_17: @saga_no i like enhancement shammy for the same reason
[2:07:27] vharakh_17: also procs
[2:07:33] anker_jym: @watchcrimson I like me some Fury Warrior. You always have a button to press
[2:07:46] witchhobbit: @watchCrimson paladin so far
[2:08:15] jgbrit: They have immensely fun rotation and very good damage mitigation AND great self healing
[2:08:19] anker_jym: My Night Elf Druid will be parked in Bel'Ameth from now on
[2:08:27] witchhobbit: it could possibly be monk next but i haven't played enough brewmaster or windwalker yet
[2:08:27] wolfcloudchaser80: And pallies just feel like they hit *really* hard in this expansion.
[2:08:48] cashthb: the lake next to shatrath with the bc fishing boy is pretty similar to that imo
[2:09:11] witchhobbit: yeah i don't know what it was like before that well but ret pally got some good good rework this expansion
[2:09:18] saga_no: @vharakh_17 Shammy is one of the classes I can't seem to wrap my head around at all, so I don't play them
[2:09:43] jgbrit: However, holy paladin is GOD AWFUL at the moment
[2:10:33] witchhobbit: @jgbrit i have been having a hard time with it in end game atm. but i felt like it was just my lack of experience in end game as holy pally LUL
[2:10:45] cashthb: @jgbrit the troughtput feels good enough in pvp, but it goes oom real fast
[2:10:56] anker_jym: I told you, Transmog meta lol
[2:10:57] elliongrey: What is the purpose of the weapons for monk? Don't they just hit with their fists and feet? lol
[2:11:33] jgbrit: Their Holy Spenders feel terrible at the moment
[2:12:09] witchhobbit: i tell you the hardest wow decision of my life rn is choosing to main priest or pally in the next expansion
[2:12:34] witchhobbit: the pros and cons of both match up too well LUL
[2:12:58] cashthb: @jgbrit wog was just a filler in mop too, and everyon's always on about how much the like mop balance. I would remove the manacost tho, it makes no sense
[2:13:29] cashthb: @jgbrit also light of dawn heals for a lot lot with one of the ovo talents
[2:13:41] cashthb: *pvp talents
[2:13:46] kynlaeh: seeing those hippo pets made me wish we had a hippo for a bear form in wow
[2:14:11] ghostie1995: if I do pvp I rather go out looking cute ðŸ˜œ
[2:14:22] elliongrey: I would just spend an hour on each just smacking stuff to see which one you like more
[2:14:24] witchhobbit: i have thought about doing a coin flip hahah
[2:14:42] Ujai321: Making a spinning wheel just to flip it afterwards seems like a lot of wasted effort
[2:14:54] jgbrit: I just remember when WOG could almost heal your full health bar and it felt amazing ðŸ˜‚
[2:15:17] cashthb: @Ujai321 it's about sending a message
[2:16:12] kynlaeh: my two fav specs are holy priest and shadow priest so no chance i leave priest anytime soon
[2:16:52] Ujai321: Unless they make a new class, and gnomes look really cute on it
[2:17:07] witchhobbit: @Ujai321 LUL
[2:17:27] saga_no: Spriest PvE main; Boomkin Classic/Wrath main; and likely Spriest (MAYBE Disco eventually) PvP main
[2:17:34] witchhobbit: true, you can be a gnome priest but you can't be a gnome pally (yet)
[2:17:50] witchhobbit: i do somehow have like 6 priests
[2:18:13] Zuldak: Can confirmed, i have one priest.
[2:18:24] kynlaeh: priest has so many pretty transmogs
[2:18:33] witchhobbit: oh yeah i have been thinking about mog a lot. since i was doing mage for so long, i have a lot of cloth. my plate collection is depressing lol
[2:18:34] watchCrimson: I find shadow priest really enjoyable to play
[2:18:34] SugarfreeStreaming: ...ugh I hate Priests. Impossible to kill in pvp :p
[2:18:36] Ujai321: Did you say 66?
[2:18:50] mockspiral: I used to try to play each armor class for different content but now transmogs are going to be universal so idk what to do anymore
[2:18:57] watchCrimson: my only problem with it is, tah tpeople always ask me to change to heal, because we dont have enough healers
[2:19:21] Ujai321: Huge gains
[2:19:41] saga_no: ...I have 12-13 priests - though only 7 of them are lvl60+
[2:19:58] Ujai321: Listen, you made infinitely more now than you did last time
[2:20:12] kynlaeh: this is the first xpac that i donâ€™t get harassed to switch to disc when i play holy and im loving it
[2:20:21] Ujai321: Also, if you keep that up, you are done in like 2 days
[2:20:37] cashthb: you know what would be a big flex? selling the mount for 1c once you get it
[2:20:40] Chuckofdoom: hello champion
[2:20:56] antiva: hi hazel! hows the pvp grind been going?
[2:21:02] ghostie1995: omg frost dk can make it ! ðŸ˜­
[2:21:04] witchhobbit: that is the other major factor, i do like holy pally but the learning curve is a lot harder than on my priest. i fell in love with holy pally in leveling dungeons but i feel like it changed a lot in end game of course LUL
[2:21:09] Ujai321: I think they made a song about that
[2:21:12] cashthb: just don't stop winning
[2:21:18] Ujai321: "all I do is win win win"
[2:21:23] antiva: good luck!!!
[2:21:59] everquest101: the trick for a  pvper wich isnt  into meta and etc and is in for fun and sets mounts is to just not think about people  rage/qq
[2:22:22] witchhobbit: my first lfr experience as holy pally was uh....interesting LUL
[2:22:52] antiva: pvp seems scary but it has some great mounts to get
[2:23:09] witchhobbit: @everquest101 makes sense sairaNodders
[2:27:07] antiva: we need like a compilation pic of hazel in all the new wigs
[2:30:16] chippchappi: wow your hair grows out fast Kappa
[2:30:40] Ujai321: !wig
[2:30:40] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[2:30:56] Ujai321: (I know you know that, it just cracks me up)
[2:31:15] wolfcloudchaser80: You're on the fun side of the roller coaster.
[2:31:26] anker_jym: As a Destro main, I must ask you to protect that Destro at all costs
[2:31:43] saga_no: Does the day of the week play a part in that?
[2:31:52] watchCrimson: I usually am on the unfun part side tho :/
[2:32:04] saga_no: Like - better players on certain days logging on? So your shuffle groups are overall just better?
[2:32:18] antiva: i dont really understand how pvp mounts work, but i remember this hippo mount that came from pvp during BFA.. would that still be obtainable somehow??
[2:32:30] Ujai321: counterpoint: people that play on a wednesday at 9 AM are maybe better than people playing on the weekend, so it's just harder
[2:32:35] anker_jym: We talk a big talk with our big Chaos Bolts, but we're just sensitive individuals on the inside
[2:32:36] cashthb: @saga_no playing is school is usually a good idea in every online game
[2:32:44] wolfcloudchaser80: PvE pugs are definitely weighted toward reset day and the day after...
[2:32:53] azumeraa: @saga_no I've been testing the better players on certain days logging on, it's absolutely rng hahaha
[2:33:11] saga_no: brb
[2:33:36] MaddiDJ4: @antiva yes. youâ€™d need to fill the bar twice to get a vicious saddle and buy it off a cendory
[2:33:43] MaddiDJ4: *vendor
[2:33:47] watchCrimson: do you think they will ever give us an option to customize the looks of the treant form for druid? I know it's just a cosmetic, but still, would be nice
[2:34:09] Ujai321: at the end of the day, the matchmaking does its job when you end up at 50%
[2:34:11] antiva: @MaddiDJ4 oh thank you!! i might just have to do that for the precious hippo lad
[2:34:26] azumeraa: @watchCrimson I wish they would bring back treant form for us with that option
[2:34:57] antiva: good luck hazel!
[2:35:00] Ujai321: 25 minutes, surely that's enough for one match
[2:35:26] cashthb: yeah, no, not on eu, some kid playing  on his/her dads account that doesn't even speak english will usually not be a very good team mate
[2:35:54] anker_jym: Yeah, you're doing great today Hazel <3 <3 <3
[2:35:58] Ujai321: subnautica around the corner
[2:36:00] Lorynn01: shuffling at healer is so good for collecting
[2:36:09] Lorynn01: *as
[2:36:33] anker_jym: Wait, they brought quests back for BG's??? Man, I need to get that new phone so I can redownload lol
[2:36:57] cashthb: I think you played more than 2 rounds
[2:37:10] Ujai321: oh, actual suggestion: Sheepy: A Short Story. it's like 45 minutes, it's free (much like PRIME SUBS), and YOU ARE A SHEEP. you might like it
[2:37:21] anker_jym: True, but when I'm on my PC, I play WoW lol. I have limited non phone gaming time
[2:37:28] Ujai321: on steam
[2:37:58] anker_jym: Wife and two kids will do that to ya lol
[2:38:05] antiva: im such a fan of the jellybean cats from legion
[2:38:13] witchhobbit: the keen eyed cian gives you the purple cat i believe c:
[2:38:20] Ujai321: it's also a platformer, so you might not like it, but again, it's free, and one of the highest rated games ever, so nothing to lose
[2:38:30] witchhobbit: i have no idea haha
[2:38:40] wolfcloudchaser80: Prime subs? you mean people that already have Amazon Prime can support a streamer they like at no cost to them?!
[2:38:54] wolfcloudchaser80: *cough*hint*cough*
[2:38:54] witchhobbit: i've been saying cian like cyan
[2:38:57] cashthb: in same vein donut county is also a relly short cutesygame that you might like... it has holes in it!
[2:40:10] antiva: its hard to keep track of people!! especially a DH
[2:40:22] anker_jym: @wolfcloudchaser80 we need to teach Hazel the ways of shameless self promotion, Crendor style lol
[2:40:59] antiva: chat can be the sellouts and yell twitch prime every once in a while
[2:41:19] wolfcloudchaser80: @anker_jym Yup. Until then, her regulars can just be shameless instead!
[2:43:26] Perkolate: bro that warlock thought you were the enemy and was lining you hardcore
[2:43:30] saga_no: .....aaand back
[2:44:01] anker_jym: I'm surprised you don't have otter pets, Hazel
[2:44:53] witchhobbit: you need a certain renown for otter pet taming i think
[2:46:16] anker_jym: @haleych right, but it's Tuskarr rep, and I know she blitzed through that grind at the beginning of DF for fishing stuff. Maybe she hasn't done the questline yet, though.
[2:46:23] witchhobbit: i remember grinding out rep on an alt to be able to tame the fae dragons and i think i still need to do the same for otters
[2:46:49] witchhobbit: i think you have to do it on a hunter tho sadly
[2:47:06] witchhobbit: yeah not too bad with the bonus
[2:47:12] anker_jym: It might be account wide? I would have to check though
[2:47:51] anker_jym: Confirmed on WoWHead, it's account wide
[2:48:39] anker_jym: Have to do a short quest chain to unlock the gaming
[2:48:42] anker_jym: Taming
[2:49:24] witchhobbit: oh then only the less dragonkin one is not acc wide, it wouldn't let me tame them until i did the renown on my hunter
[2:49:43] anker_jym: You are correct, that one is character locked
[2:50:04] witchhobbit: yeah it is confusing
[2:50:09] anker_jym: I wish it was all account wide
[2:51:22] Leterius: I believe they said most things will be account wide next xpansion
[2:52:21] keyboardturner: old reps aren't going to be account wide (yet) because the old reps are different system than renown is
[2:52:30] lilhunbun: i just bought the twilight pack
[2:52:32] Aladeri: how hard is it to get the vicious mounts?
[2:52:49] anker_jym: Yeah, that whole account wide thing is for sure going to take multiple expansions to complete
[2:53:21] antiva: i love this song
[2:53:48] mindflayerMinis: Hazel the hair looks rad!
[2:54:30] Aladeri: hot diggity dog
[2:55:29] keyboardturner: some of the nathria / sepulcher pvp sets were pretty nice
[2:55:37] antiva: i love the short pink hair!
[2:55:51] cicerospqr: Hi
[2:55:53] mylothic: Hazel, what should I get for lunch, im craving something green
[2:56:06] antiva: adorable <3
[2:56:22] cicerospqr: Sorry, im watching the MDI on another chan... But just wanted to drop my prime sub here
[2:56:27] mylothic: lol yes
[2:56:33] cicerospqr: <3
[2:56:36] watchCrimson: spinach
[2:56:53] cicerospqr: cicerospqr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! :)
[2:56:53] Streamlabs: cicerospqr just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:57:02] cashthb: nope
[2:57:05] witchhobbit: yup :/
[2:57:05] cashthb: yes
[2:57:12] antiva: @mylothic i wasnt asked but something with guacamole >:)
[2:57:12] kynlaeh: do yall have quesada over in victoria? i like their tofu burrito bowls well enough
[2:57:12] witchhobbit: just gotta start the quest
[2:57:19] HeatherLianne: HeatherLianne subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[2:57:19] Streamlabs: heatherlianne just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:57:22] witchhobbit: in sw, talk to bolvar
[2:57:41] cashthb: don't you have to do the intro anyway? it's sooo long
[2:57:43] anker_jym: Thank the Light for the Shadowlands intro skip
[2:57:57] cashthb: I don't mean the maw, just the oribos rp
[2:58:05] R1_Prototype: The quest actually starts at the NPC in front of grommash hold. for horde anyway. lol
[2:58:12] witchhobbit: oops darion not bolvar lol
[2:58:27] R1_Prototype: on horde itâ€™s hard to find. itâ€™s not mission board for some reason.
[2:58:38] antiva: @El_Capitan_Live my bank alt keeps getting yelled at by bolvar because of this
[2:58:42] witchhobbit: yeah it should
[2:58:47] cashthb: shorter than I remembered
[2:59:17] cashthb: that's bg set
[3:00:03] cashthb: buy the conduits!
[3:01:02] kynlaeh: i donâ€™t play many classes but i have 500 marks of honor and have all the priest sets so i need to get alts to buy sets on
[3:01:03] budapestppp: do u ever eat salmon and then u somehow smell like salmon for half a day
[3:01:28] sence_00: those two vendors are the pvp ones ya
[3:02:16] witchhobbit: @kynlaeh make a mage and warlock!
[3:02:28] witchhobbit: ooh yeah the weapons
[3:03:03] witchhobbit: @haleych so your priest can use some of it. unless i'm totally forgetting how pvp sets work
[3:03:12] kynlaeh: i wish i could just buy the individual weapons that i can use on my priest first cuz for some reason 80 marks on honor seems like a lot to drop on weapons im not gonna ever use lol
[3:03:32] witchhobbit: the little pvp i do i have been really enjoying the honor system
[3:03:33] kynlaeh: @haleych  thatâ€™s smart i need to get those class levelled then
[3:03:54] witchhobbit: you get so much marks of honor easily its really not bad at all
[3:04:00] Aladeri: i'm getting taco bell today :)
[3:04:34] witchhobbit: i went to legion pvp vendors immediately when i got my first bunch of marks of honor
[3:04:34] cashthb: will you listen to rebecca black?
[3:04:53] GreenArrowed: byyyeeee
[3:04:54] jakefx1: Cya tomorrow!!
[3:04:59] Aladeri: yay :) will see you then
[3:05:05] Leterius: bye bye
