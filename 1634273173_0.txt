[1:25:36] Plateskin: U trolling us, sir. LUL
[1:25:39] Rad_Red15: the longer the better imo
[1:25:50] Enigmio: its similiar to shadowlands
[1:25:52] Rad_Red15: I'm not attracted to easy. ...
[1:25:54] Pallyofhell: 1-60 is easier
[1:25:54] Godzilla03: saying theres no content before max level is very ignorant.
[1:25:58] Pallyofhell: 60-70 isnt
[1:26:07] priv0: there's heirlooms though
[1:26:07] Slobberbutt: Leveling is already easy. LUL
[1:26:17] Pallyofhell: heirlooms got changed
[1:26:20] Slayer_Eagleone: @Pallyofhell so will leveling be much faster than slands or much slower??
[1:26:23] aussie_pleb: 10 to 60 atm is 5 hours with buff
[1:26:24] JackDTank: so like classic tbc rather then like actually
[1:26:30] zachuhrooster: SWIFTY been playing prot warr in pvp LOVE it
[1:26:31] EliBourne: maybe it seemed easier because i didnt die as much lol
[1:26:33] Slayer_Eagleone: i dont believe that
[1:26:38] Pallyofhell: slower than shadowlands @Slayer_Eagleone
[1:26:43] Plateskin: If it stays the way it is on beta is gonna be really fast.
[1:26:46] Slayer_Eagleone: leveling shoud be faster
[1:26:51] Slayer_Eagleone: in retail
[1:26:52] JackDTank: or specifically like wrath prepatch
[1:27:02] Not_From_Oz: Did they get rid of threads of fate??  Thought I read that somewhere.
[1:27:04] EliBourne: chat youre being trolled
[1:27:08] JayZ1904: It’s good to have it longer. It’s an MMO. Leveling is part of the game.
[1:27:22] galifax2: think shadowlands is being put into chromie time
[1:27:25] EliBourne: no it isnt
[1:27:32] Slayer_Eagleone: DansGame thats not true
[1:27:36] coolcrazyguy72: what if they increased max level cap to 300 but let you do endgame content at level 10
[1:27:44] Milim_Argento: were those paladin and rogue dps at tho xD
[1:27:55] Slayer_Eagleone: i read that leveling is supposed to be 50% faster on retail
[1:27:56] EliBourne: i did it as fury warrior from 60-70 and only died 5 times
[1:28:01] Plateskin: Leveling should be te introduction to the lore of the xpack, nothing beyond that.

[1:29:55] un_original: is arena gear in DF still very much annoying to upgrade ???
[1:29:55] Pallyofhell: they made it so you cant get to 70 w/o doing the side quests
[1:29:58] Mateollz: 1 W eek and like 5-6 DAYs
[1:29:59] Slobberbutt: 1 week of leveling 2 years of being 70. However, the arena starting like that is kinda lame.
[1:30:13] JackDTank: so far i think im going to stick to wrath but its a big maybe DF looks really really fun

[2:27:30] Nergalz69: I do
[2:27:34] daxypoo71: yeah
[2:27:51] Tordrek_: doesnt need to be a thing in retail

[2:28:24] SilkeySmooth: there is no more pvp gear ranks in DF
[2:28:25] warn1ng: 50% is huge
[2:28:25] Doom_Cherry: no
[2:28:35] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:29:04] SilkeySmooth: again there is no more pvp ranks in DF...lol
[2:29:07] MrTyeDie: It quite literally makes your grind 50% less lmao
[2:29:16] Vendralos: @SilkeySmooth Yeah, that might make me actually play PvP now. Upgrading gear was always annoying to me. But you still upgrade the PvE ilvl
[2:29:17] warnings__: Ya but you have 50% more potato’s on alliance
[2:29:17] Nuvak1711: I mean...we can cross-faction grp for pve content now so alliance getting the 50% bonus seems kinda unfair if there's factionwide stuff like that even if it's not tied to pvp specifically
[2:29:18] MrTyeDie: Idk how your brain didn’t compute that
[2:30:08] wenja_88: bering back the evil swifty
[2:30:11] SilkeySmooth: @Vendralos one honor set and one conquest set no ranks swifty isnt reading..lol
[2:30:29] temptedone: ughhh pre patch extended by 3 hrs....
[2:30:34] daxypoo71: fifty percent is, like, half of all of it
[2:30:35] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[2:30:46] Vendralos: He's saying you don't need to upgrade PvP gear anymore
[2:30:50] Anoffday: whats swifty doing in retail when patch is done
[2:31:01] CosmicRay: @daxypoo71 more simple to say 1x and 1,5x :P
[2:32:06] StarshipTheseus: how long till the servers are supposed to go live?
[2:32:09] StarshipTheseus: anyone know?
[2:32:14] Nuvak1711: 50% is pretty ridiculous honestly like 10% would've made sense
[2:32:14] Vendralos: True LUL
[2:32:27] Anoffday: 3 hrs
[2:32:30] DjSpudNZL: pre patch should be up in a few minutes
[2:32:44] Tordrek_: i mean. they're trying to get more alliance players.
[2:32:45] Vendralos: @DjSpudNZL It's pushed back 3 hours
[2:32:47] xJPMx: no it got delayed 3 hours
[2:32:51] Nuvak1711: Just go watch a movie or watch a series xD
[2:32:56] temptedone: 3 more hrs
[2:33:05] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:33:12] Anoffday: swifty what are retail plans once you can login
[2:33:12] KY_DZNTS: i just showed up . who gets a 50% boost, for the new expansion or in genreal?
[2:33:16] Lancin1987: I think I win more bgs as horde though, which means more bonus honor from winning
[2:33:21] DjSpudNZL: oh damn didn't see my bad champions
[2:33:36] KY_DZNTS: wow. so the race to world first is set
[2:33:42] Aitor229: why only alliance?
[2:33:48] Nuvak1711: You still get the 20% xp bonus if you have warmode active
[2:33:52] Vendralos: Does the bonus apply to Conquest too?
[2:33:57] Nuvak1711: For lvling
[2:34:02] swiftyhealer: @swifty 1 minute
[2:34:06] Nuvak1711: No
[2:34:09] Nuvak1711: Just honor
[2:34:25] KY_DZNTS: ok just honor
[2:34:28] KY_DZNTS: thats ok
[2:34:34] redheadmike1: Noone will play alliance, no bonus will change that.
[2:34:36] grungelife: @Aitor229 to balance factions horde has a higher player base
[2:34:39] newkingcody: retail servers delayed another 3 hours @Swifty
[2:35:07] Galdrena: :\
[2:35:12] Vendralos: @redheadmike1 I think people will, because we have access to Horde players as Alliance now
[2:35:27] daxypoo71: lulz- i love bears
[2:35:38] Nuvak1711: @redheadmike1 Well some of the allied races are pretty neat just for the racials sure. But yeah Horde is too popular for ppl to swap over.
[2:35:48] Tordrek_: mixed faction raids. you'll definitely have people playing alliance
[2:35:48] kulter994: Yoooo Swifty!!  Doing Naxx? How's it going?
[2:35:51] cometcruiser001: i've always been alliance since BC. *shrugs*
[2:35:56] swiftyhealer: @swifty other 3 hours were delayed on retail
[2:36:05] Galdrena: he knows
[2:36:17] Vendralos: @cometcruiser001 I've been Alliance forever too
[2:36:24] zoomers0MEGALUL: For half the grind time the buff would have to be 100% tho
[2:36:45] Nuvak1711: Then again racials are kinda mediocre in retail now it doesn't really matter what race you play even if you're a damn vupera furry lover LUL
[2:36:48] cometcruiser001: i feel weird playing anything besides a dwarf tbh.
[2:36:57] watchmeclickspells: WG TIME!
[2:37:04] Tordrek_: 50% = half the honor
[2:37:13] Tordrek_: so its only 150% in total not 200%
[2:38:01] renohaarlem123456789: What is that addon from the spell ?
[2:38:05] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:38:07] zoomers0MEGALUL: well u said instead of 12 hours alliance can grind 6 for the same amont. Thats not correct. Instead of 12 they do 9
[2:38:10] Tordrek_: its simple math
[2:38:23] Vendralos: 1/4th?
[2:38:30] scottbur13: 3/4 the time
[2:38:35] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[2:38:38] renohaarlem123456789: For every spell toedek?
[2:38:41] Vendralos: No wait, 3/4th yeah
[2:38:50] scottbur13: 9 hours
[2:38:55] xJPMx: 9
[2:38:55] Wazuup23: 9
[2:39:04] MrTyeDie: Imagine being a full blown adult arguing about that math in a twitch chat smh
[2:39:12] Nuvak1711: 12hrs? On retail? Does it really take THAT long to grind pvp gear on retail now? I haven't played retail for like over a year now
[2:39:23] balduar101: stop with the mathematics 😆
[2:39:27] Vendralos: @MrTyeDie Imagine having an issue with that
[2:39:29] nakitaredbeard: still on track for 1hr 20 m clear?
[2:39:37] renohaarlem123456789: Name of that spell addon please?
[2:39:39] Tordrek_: @MrTyeDie assumign adults only watch people on twitch
[2:39:40] zooka305: Lmaoooo
[2:39:50] nulleben: You are on your way to loatheb
[2:39:53] TobbeLainen: Why u heroic strike instead of cleave when its multiple targets?
[2:40:31] coconust1: you did construct , arachnid and war wing
[2:40:47] Not_From_Oz: They extended maintenance for you to finish the and get your gear!!!
[2:40:48] Paneledone: Anyone know how long before the servers are up for DF Pre-patch?
[2:41:02] Galdrena: 3 more hours
[2:41:07] NothingSpecialGamer: 6pst
[2:41:07] MrTyeDie: @tordrek_ I guess if you’re a child or adolescent I can make more sense of it; I still find it hard to believe people are spending there free time thata way but whatever I guess Kappa
[2:41:14] Paneledone: :O :(
[2:41:24] Paneledone: @Galdrena Thank you :)
[2:41:28] NothingSpecialGamer: their*
[2:41:30] Smite_Engine: if you get 150k honour in the same time it would normally take 100k, you'd reach the 100k mark in 2/3 of the time
[2:41:30] Galdrena: you're welcome :)
[2:41:33] swiftyhealer: @swifty sorry to let you know they going other 3 hours in retail
[2:41:36] Vendralos: @MrTyeDie Why is this something that concerns you?
[2:41:47] Galdrena: @swiftyhealer he knows
[2:41:50] xJPMx: imagine thinking that was an argument, then spending time causing drama about it in twitch chat Kappa
[2:42:06] Vendralos: @xJPMx Thank you

[2:43:37] Psykonautt: thats tough
[2:43:42] caglenation: not sure why people are not supprised about it being extended
[2:43:53] daxypoo71: swifty vs food new channel

[2:44:09] Holytankman: ques will be bad
[2:44:13] Nuvak1711: You have to do those challenges on an empty stomach lol. Like you can't eat for like 24hrs if you want to win something like that
[2:44:31] Psykonautt: no one is playing wow retail today lol
[2:44:31] daxypoo71: chestnut

[2:44:48] daxypoo71: and la beast
[2:44:54] Vendralos: @MrTyeDie Take your own advice :)
[2:45:05] Psykonautt: @JayZ1904 they obviously have their priorities in order lol
[2:45:06] grungelife: I mean the only thing this is adding is the UI and the talents I get its reset day but the real event doesn't start until the 15th right?

[3:23:58] L0UKIE: hey @Swifty did you test the bleed and leech in pvp for warrior any good?
[3:24:01] mythicgaming101: are u a arms war tank or does prot war get rend @Swifty ?
[3:24:01] amdostreams: yea i hope rbgs become relevant, theres no point in doing it if you can just do 2's
[3:24:02] Galdrena: !server
[3:24:02] StreamElements: Swifty is on Benediction for WoTLK Classic. For Retail and others type !realm.

[3:24:45] Tordrek_: 478?
[3:24:47] Tordrek_: what
[3:25:01] Pallyofhell: conduits arent a thing in dragon flight
[3:25:08] Pallyofhell: so rbg isnt dead
[3:25:24] geppetto690: hello Swifty what meta gem do you use in your pvp build?
[3:25:56] Tordrek_: they're easy to buy with soul cinder
[3:26:05] DeZyLoNe: @vekman1337 just nu kör jag mest shadowlands, warzone, köpte spelet för ett år sen men hade inte alls tid så tog och börja köra det nu haha. Jo men absolut kan vi det
[3:26:18] allianceisbest: We are still talking about MMR
[3:26:19] amdostreams: but no one bother's with rbg's since you can get the same rewards by just doing 2's/3's besides titles
[3:26:48] Ralffeh: they should make rbgs solo que aswell, it's way too much effort to gather 10 people that's why they've never been popular
[3:26:49] allianceisbest: Dang it  they extended the maintenance to 8pm central coast time
[3:27:02] w1dowmak3r: but isnt that the point the grind of rating instead of being easy?
[3:27:07] Pallyofhell: rbgs died cause of the toxicty of the rbg community nothing else
[3:27:26] Vendralos: Queue sniping
[3:27:36] vekman9: @dezylone Gött! Lirar också warzon jag kör på Xbox dock men kan lägga till dig i warszone 👌
