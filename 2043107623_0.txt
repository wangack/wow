[2:49:55] cryptowarr: just search for your computer, device, switch, router, etc provider website most of the times they have recommended cables for each region
[2:51:21] cryptowarr: like for example at my company we received a Switch same model 3 different versions, one had a C15 italian conector and the rest a regular C13 but the A V was important there because those switchs could draw lots of power
[2:51:52] cryptowarr: if it connects and A V is enought for draw you are totally fine the more A V the bett
