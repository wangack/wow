[1:20:51] ClassicMalcontent: As for mobile if the mobile offers a mount in the PC version of WoW or other games on the PC side it could garner more interest.
[1:21:04] nathrizen: is it developed in Unity or Unreal?

[1:23:18] ClassicMalcontent: @tandian4445 I only came back to WoW in 9.2.x to level alts to 60 before Dragonflight. YMMV of course heh. So far it's okay. Covenants and Anima seem like something (for me) just to try but not bother much with. I'm Dragonflight prep mode lol.
[1:23:43] BlinkHeals: @towelliee i hope its not outdated genre like auto chess or shadow legneds type

[1:26:45] generaljosh721: I hadn‚Äôt thought about that but when/if shadowlands dungeons get picked as M+ (assuming the pattern sticks beyond dragonflight), the covenant specific shortcuts/buffs won‚Äôt carry over. I wonder how they‚Äôll solve that

[2:23:49] fred_birkhoff: does wow make more money even with inflation?
[2:23:56] GamerKillance: They're never going to be able to brag about players again though. I remember Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK and beginning with Cata they bragged about sub count. WoD broke the back and made them hide the sub numbers. Should they are making more money, but popularity certainly declined

[2:45:58] Deadcells: Do you think WoW will ever get their sub counts back to what it was when Draenor game out?
[2:46:00] cahoots82: Not at all, but where is the next round of players going to come from when there's no B-tier guild to pull talent from?
[2:46:01] mmo_kenna_: it's hard to compete at that level if you have real life jobs etc maybe one day mythic is all equalised ilvl etc
[2:46:02] Colt_Engineer: would you say pieces broke up into pieces KEKW
[2:46:04] SonofHorus82: @henorist3004 approximately 3 hours from now.
[2:46:04] dreamwalker213: Max said they were already talking to some pieces players before the news came oht

[2:46:19] handlebarswow: Max has even said that their 20 man roster isn't even "max skill" like.. they still need better skilled players.. the pool is pretty small
[2:46:28] abe4th: Andy is one that left pieces for Method a while ago and it worked out for him I'd say
[2:46:30] Mattsta: it sounded more like their RL wanted to step down and no one in the guild was interested in leading
[2:46:36] king_julian_96: so with peices gone then who is goign to compete with liquid and method for  world first of the first dragonflight raid
[2:46:54] NVbrutal: would love to see some join bdgg to help them compete for that top spot.
[2:47:01] Elevate67: !warc
[2:47:01] Mecabeast: wonder if it's possible have a minor league/major league format like baseball
[2:47:13] Elevate67: !warcraftmobile

[2:47:36] dreamwalker213: @blazer_6_6 grievous spiteful
[2:47:51] Blazer_6_6: @dreamwalker213 uh easy :D thy
[2:47:56] rosina_scarlett: Well tbh they got world second due to Liquid taking the few day break to reset
[2:48:10] Metket: "breaking"
[2:48:13] manmower: i think RWF takes too much time for the reward for almost everyone
[2:48:20] handlebarswow: @masumi_scarlett true, but they still got it.. and they had to rebuild
[2:48:21] faulen: They need out of game support
[2:48:33] Mecabeast: if sloot got wf lord help yall for that following bruv night
[2:48:35] rosina_scarlett: I think Sloot would do well in Liquid if he got recruited by them
[2:48:37] rosina_scarlett: @masumi_scarlett yeah
[2:48:38] abe4th: at times BDGG played lights out but then on their re-clears it was rough
[2:49:04] raye_gaming22: i love ted but big dumm guild played worse than my wr 30 guild they just did 2x as mutch hrs
[2:49:16] sarbapowa: cs
[2:49:17] Scoodles91: league
[2:49:17] ongtehjem: SK gaming used to rule CSGO
[2:49:17] Kebabra_: LoL
[2:49:18] rosina_scarlett: WoW, League, CSGO
[2:49:18] KingSlayerYotam: 0 intensive to be a world 5-10 guild beside moving on to echo/ limit later
[2:49:21] NVbrutal: think SK has a league team
[2:49:21] izabeL: @Towelliee CSGO
[2:49:22] squirellplays: Legendary name in lol and cs
[2:49:30] sarbapowa: league. cs
[2:49:48] king_julian_96: so with peices what  other guilds are goign to compete with liquid and method then in first raid of dragonflight
[2:50:00] stabzmcgeee: didnt this happen last time SK had a wow guild? like cata ish,, they started a team it didnt get 1st then it broke up?
[2:50:29] falldrgn: If sloot gets a WF.. He will legit cry..
[2:50:37] manmower: a raid race doesn't make a good official monetized esport
[2:50:43] ongtehjem: Towellie Gaming, Las Vegas team base casino every sunday night Kappa
[2:50:43] falldrgn: and I think most of us will
[2:50:51] NVbrutal: feel like Method is coming for that number 1 again they did really well this tier only gonna get stronger.
[2:51:08] manmower: taking 2 weeks off work, that's a lot of money
[2:51:11] Mecabeast: arena and mdi teams will have an easier time I think then a whole guild
[2:51:28] xluckydawgx: its basically an F1 structure. its all money until theres no more
[2:51:28] faulen: as much as Liquid and Echo hate to admit it, it is a 2 horse race.
[2:51:39] abe4th: do the RWF guys get a salary? I've heard it talked about but nothing concrete.
[2:51:41] abe4th: Ah okay.
[2:51:42] ongtehjem: Liquid is almost in every Esports imo
[2:51:47] Colt_Engineer: $20 is $20 amiright?
[2:52:12] rosina_scarlett: Sco did good with the rebuild
[2:52:18] nyliah: Method was aiming for 4th place for this tier so they are pretty pumped up for next tier for sure
[2:52:23] tetrahydridodinitrogen: Right now it is Echo and everyone else
[2:52:27] dimofodi: Method already signed like half of Pieces...Source: 4chan
[2:52:30] ongtehjem: i thought method would disband because of the scandals
[2:52:33] stabzmcgeee: disagree,, i think method did what hey did the last few tier but looks better because it was 2nd! but really they were days behind not actually up there
[2:52:38] swervity82: i know it's unrealistic, but i personally feel method should not be allowed to complete for years as a punishment
[2:53:02] griffdog125: @ongtehjem  they did and rebuilt
[2:53:10] manmower: didn't Pieces beat Liquid this last tier?
[2:53:10] Deadcells: Method has some highly skilled and friendly people in their guild now.
[2:53:10] king_julian_96: be interesting to see how many bosses and how hard  the bosses will be in the primalists raid in dragonflight
[2:53:10] Shurn_82: @ongtehjem most of them left when that shit hit the fan yea, method now isnt who they were before
[2:53:14] mlxalott: how long the servers usually go down for?
[2:53:15] Eziak: I‚Äôm glad Avade is coming back for liquid
[2:53:22] dkapocalypse: method will come back for that crown
[2:53:23] NVbrutal: @ongtehjem they kinda did disband, sco had to rebuild the entire raid team, his former raiders are now current echo lol
[2:53:28] ongtehjem: @griffdog125 disband meaning totally change org not sticking to same name
[2:53:40] DiiscoViking: possible not likely
[2:53:47] stabzmcgeee: like dont get me wrong for them to turn around like they have is fucking impressive but still not quite echo/limit level; imo
[2:53:50] Deadcells: @manmower yes but because Liquid called it quits and went home because they were burnt out according to Max
[2:53:53] Shurn_82: @ongtehjem thats now what disband means really, you me rebrand right?
[2:53:56] kalzhen: reveal what?

[2:54:24] manmower: @Deadcells ah, only 1st place probably matters anyhow
[2:54:24] ongtehjem: @Shurn_82 sort of, because of scandals i think sponsors wont have trust in that name no?
[2:54:24] EvilStreak: why not just do showcase while the servers are down monkaS
[2:54:37] abe4th: I hope the mobile game is dope. But honestly no clue what type of game it'll be. I'll play it though lol

[2:55:00] Roaringkittylol: I could see that... Pokemon Go / WoW Pet Battles...
[2:55:07] Yosbo: @rsimpson105 harry potter tried that and failed so WoW would def fail if they go that route
[2:55:08] lmtheboogie: @Towelliee do you think this mobile game will entice people who don't play mobile games to play it?
[2:55:09] mrpresbaby: are you going to play your youtube video on stream with us?
[2:55:10] Deadcells: @manmower exactly
[2:55:14] Shurn_82: @ongtehjem i agree...its an odd play to keep the name
[2:55:22] manmower: they give EU vacation time and stuff
[2:55:27] magnumirl: tru
[2:55:35] frazlord: Liquid also got there an entire week early and got burnt out

[2:56:30] Mecabeast: 3hrs now right?
[2:56:38] ongtehjem: no matter how good they are rebuilding i still wont give much trust to Method as a brand
[2:56:42] Deadcells: Why do these teams rent out hotels rather than playing from home?
[2:56:44] SmallzzIV: aspect ratio

[2:57:40] jhopps12: it's not the aspect ratio. you have an addon that changes the font from the default font. I'm sure that's what he's talking about @Towelliee
[2:57:43] manmower: does the new mobile game have tracking software?
[2:57:47] kirtyalex: LUL
[2:57:49] Klarynse: at the end of the day...all people make mistakes and it just what they do to try to make up for it in the end
[2:57:51] stabzmcgeee: @arminjarmin im guessin gits his elvui font

[3:00:29] Bennodkk: wf race is not entirely pay to win since everyone knows Echo or Liquid would still win even if they didn't pay people to trade stuff

[3:01:24] theDirtyon3: RIP pieces
[3:01:26] tetrahydridodinitrogen: I think Echo was paying 3mil for drops with sockets or leach ect
[3:01:32] Dalinaar: 6-7 HUNDRED million??
[3:01:33] reggiepowa: they had buying power but their clout is much smaller
[3:01:38] KylerNA: I watched some pieces streamers and most of the time their groups were like empty for a while waiting for someone to apply.
[3:01:38] luckfore: top 2 are echo and method btw
[3:01:38] griffdog125: @Bennodkk not true,  if liquid and echo didnt pay 100's of millions of gold to people for giving them gear/tier pieces other guild like method could have easily beat them out

[3:01:43] oldcrankybeard: how long do you think it takes groups like limit and echo to pay it all back
[3:01:54] stabzmcgeee: echo and liquid also have the huge fan bases in NA and EU so they really get 1st pick at boes etc
[3:02:00] Roaringkittylol: Not sure why they just dont create seperate servers like they did for the WoW Area back in the day. Completely eliminate this shady gold crap.
[3:02:03] khrovaa: how is that much gold spent, i just don‚Äôt know anything
[3:02:03] Quecklain: @griffdog125 KEKW

[3:02:48] Balkep: @ongtehjem Pieces of Musk Kappa

[3:03:39] Colt_Engineer: token the black guy?
[3:03:39] Shurn_82: @reggiepowa I believe he said that, but i doubt that being true
[3:03:40] reggiepowa: @reggiepowa seems pretty reasonable to me, why would he lie about that?
[3:03:41] atmfees: max has said their orgs do not buy them tokens, ever
[3:03:43] ghettolobst3r: Token buff
[3:03:47] Balkep: almost like turtle power
[3:03:49] ShowDUH: @Shurn_82 they do sales for like 10m a mount like super early
[3:03:50] rsimpson105: @Towelliee Ah yeah, Token from South Park

[3:04:57] reggiepowa: @Shurn_82 that's different then, you are basing your opinion on whether you like someone as a person and not on a rational basis
[3:04:59] TheCheeseWheel87: Companies that spend money on those expenses can write that off for taxes. Our company provides lunch 5days a week and it becomes a write off at the end of the year.

[3:52:49] kokochris: FF is very story driven, I was one of them.  I didnt want to be spoiled

[3:52:55] Moobot:  Join us May 3rd @ 10AM PDT for the reveal of the brand new Warcraft Mobile Game: https://reveal.blizzard.com/en-us/ towPog
[3:52:58] BullDevil: Maybe its because people don't want story spoilers in FF14 so they avoid streams, IDK
[3:52:58] SaDos: I have started believing that ff14 players are on average kinda dumber than other communities... they do shit for no reason
[3:53:09] Galithraniaa: @Towelliee The servers have been an issue since the launch of ARR. They're had ages to fix it yet they still use their old bogus excuse as to why they can't fix it.
[3:53:22] DeeterDo: those 4-6 hour queues were just insane
[3:53:27] Pritamin: i remember watching soda trying toget into ff for like 2 weeks he played like 4 mins one time

[3:53:32] ArcaneSyntax: I think next time I won't even play the launch, i'll wait a month and then play it.
[3:53:33] Colt_Engineer: @BullDevil I don't watch any WoW streamers playing beta or ptr cause I don't want the story spoiled
[3:53:34] ClassicMalcontent: @BullDevil that's exactly what it is. The FF audience waits to complete it before watching streams.
[3:53:38] Thoreya: the story has been out for like months now
[3:53:40] Allsee_: @MilesKG21 Same
[3:53:44] Thoreya: ppl still dont wanna be spoiled? lmao
[3:54:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having the drops and the competition kind of like Lost Ark did is the best way to go for launches imo

[4:14:47] AlphasaurusRexx: @DragonofWolves we dont know anything about dragonlands tier set wtf you talking about
