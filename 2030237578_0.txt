[0:56:34] egb5: its taking small amount of shrooms
[0:56:34] sneak272: it's a little bit of shrooms so you get the positive effects without the euphoria
[0:56:34] 18jsilvanuskill: it just gives you a small boost of the trip
[0:56:36] GoodBoiiRey: there are different things that it can mean @TommyKayLIVE
[0:56:37] PabloTescobar26: Taking a little bit of a drug so you get some positive effects
[0:56:37] SuperClifford: Taking just a tiny amount of mushrooms daily
[0:56:38] dennisthemenace1997: @tommykaylive you have to unlock reforms in the tiers before that one to unlock it
[0:56:38] 18jsilvanuskill: its way less intense

[0:56:50] WaterIsHydrating: You have something like LSD in small amounts so that you aren't actually feeling the full impact
[0:56:51] MisterJ50: you take small amount of a certain drugs
[0:56:51] 18jsilvanuskill: not really
[0:56:54] SoEinRuben: thats because their normal medicine is so much stronger than ours
[0:56:55] SuperClifford: But MACRO Dosing is best
[0:56:56] PabloTescobar26: Usually psychedelics
[0:56:56] 18jsilvanuskill: it can be good
[0:56:57] sneak272: the ideal is that you're not euphoric, but it makes you more upbeat
[0:56:58] BatsiPlays: I think it is a minimal dose of shrooms, you dont really get high but all your anxiiety goes away
[0:56:59] MisterJ50: it helps for certain deasease
[0:57:01] daijahaden: It's when you take very small amounts of hallucinagens. Not enough to actually trip, but supposedly enough to give you a better mood
[0:57:05] jan_hendrik01: Japan game already won?
[0:57:06] 18jsilvanuskill: you dont trip
[0:57:13] Vegasmcswagger: drugs arent the baba yaga tommy some are fine, addiction is the problem

[0:57:56] CircleSocialClub: The cool boys do it, i wanna do it to
[0:57:56] dennisthemenace1997: @tommykaylive you have to select reform in the pervious tiers in order to be able to take that one. once u reach that tier you can take that colonist reform
[0:57:58] 18jsilvanuskill: and amphtimenes they're not good
[0:58:02] Ashspark_: microdosing shrooms is kinda ez, I could do it and just go to the office and work just fine

[0:59:32] BatsiPlays: Did you never try alcohol or did you just quit as you got older?
[0:59:32] daijahaden: @prolhty Unironically yes. They do a podcast they call "protect our parks", when they smoke and drink. I think he drank 18 Bud Lights the last one
[0:59:33] Vegasmcswagger: @Ugapiku you have home made wine?
[0:59:34] GoldFangTheDemonic: Can you curry favors with naples to break his alliances later?
[0:59:37] josticer1: dont forget to pay off your loan
[0:59:39] Jaetsu: @TommyKayLIVE the only mistake so far s early devving
[0:59:40] abooba_car: not worth it to build markeplace when it just gives +3,4
[0:59:42] prolhty: @daijahaden jesus
[0:59:43] Ugapiku: @Ugapiku ofc made by myself
[0:59:46] bdekaiser: tommykPOGGER tommykPOGGER tommykPOGGER
[0:59:47] Mannrik: you would be far better if you didnt develop at all, you keep falling behind on tech because of that
[0:59:49] 18jsilvanuskill: @josticer1 pay of your loans
[0:59:52] Vegasmcswagger: @Ugapiku nice dude
[0:59:52] electric_sea: you can still take risks and lose wars. one lost war is no reason to quit the game.
[0:59:54] defaltazer: some tips arent helpfull for people who are just beginning
[0:59:58] bassaris1: Do you have the states edicts on @TommyKayLIVE ?
[1:00:03] vugiiiii: do you have aragon under PU
[1:00:03] zCasi98: you can do the region edict for reform spread if you didn't already
[1:00:04] Ugapiku: @Ugapiku ye, family recipe/tradition
[1:00:06] StraightTuna: collecting from Gibraltar trade node?
[1:00:08] Gehennasfire: microdosing sounds like belittleing the drug problem, ist like saying :"Im not THAT addicted"
[1:00:08] fettersack187: sss+
[1:00:19] GoodBoiiRey: i really dislike the development system tbh
[1:00:24] Deus_Vult_95: get Burgers to 60% influence and loyalty to get -10 dev cost bonus @TommyKayLIVE
[1:00:29] jdcro89: you should start fabricating a claim on tlemcen for later
[1:00:31] 18jsilvanuskill: try to dev for institution
[1:00:31] cheesemaker3000: Insult a rival
[1:00:41] WaterIsHydrating: Habibi's advice about developing was a bit confusing because he will understand where he can and can't get away with burning through mana
[1:00:41] vugiiiii: insukt
[1:00:43] Ataata112: you can embargo rivals or insult them
[1:00:45] zCasi98: embargo already?
[1:00:48] Lord_Antik0r: @TommyKayLIVE insult rivals for PP :)
[1:00:49] verdefir: Insult
[1:00:50] justsomehabibi: also you really could win the war against portugal and tlemecen, especially if you build an extra carrack or two, so I don't see the point in waiting
[1:00:53] imSubt1e: @Gehennasfire nah you've got it way wrong.. if you were super addicted you wouldnt microdose.. you'd just full dose.. and you dont microdose to get super high either
[1:01:00] SoEinRuben: ohne flei√ü keinen preis
[1:01:01] Razihel_Ita: Insulting your rivals gives you power projection, also embargo i think
[1:01:01] zCasi98: it's mathematics
[1:01:06] verdefir: Send scornful insult
[1:01:12] vugiiiii: do you have aragon under PU
[1:01:13] Deus_Vult_95: get Burgers to 60% influence and loyalty to get -10 dev cost bonus @TommyKayLIVE
[1:01:13] abooba_car: its about min maxing
[1:01:17] tristanauftwitch: As someone who used to do this kind of stuff (like microdosing) a lot, there is very little research on it, and the research that exists suggests it's more likely to harm you than help. Especially for developing brains. So probably a bad idea.
[1:01:17] pbertrand_dev: The hard working ant eats the road kill
[1:01:17] 18jsilvanuskill: who are portugals rivals
[1:01:18] linguiniyes: @TommyKayLIVE for the next institution u can buy it from countries that have already embraced it
[1:01:19] viktor_mehl: will you do colonizng?
[1:01:20] defaltazer: being curious and stuff
[1:01:21] Mannrik: eu4 is all about adding those little bonuses together
[1:01:24] wardenhere: kinda like the early bird gets the worm
[1:01:29] JohnTheTurtleMa: Thats ammazing wow
[1:01:31] JohnTheTurtleMa: Lucky
[1:01:35] sneak272: @imSubt1e microdose - at least for me - feels only slightly more 'impactful' than a cup of coffee
[1:01:40] 18jsilvanuskill: work with tunis against tlemcen
[1:01:46] Jaetsu: gems op ncome
[1:01:47] VboyChaos: you gonna use spy network or let it stay at 100
[1:01:49] 18jsilvanuskill: then betray tunis later
[1:01:50] gandalf_the_slav: Yo faceting in Iberia is really lucky, nice
[1:01:53] jdcro89: keep an eye on france, since england is still on the continent, maybe you get lucky and france decs on them
[1:01:53] paarthursnaax: fortune favors the bold?
[1:01:54] PrismaOnea: Barcelona mentioned
[1:01:57] JohnTheTurtleMa: Faceting can span in anly glass or gems land and Aragon spawned it
[1:01:59] zCasi98: gems and gold best items to produce
[1:02:02] Gehennasfire: @Gehennasfire i get yyour point PETPET
[1:02:03] verdefir: Check who  steers trade away from you and embarg them
[1:02:04] vugiiiii: do you have aragon?
[1:02:09] defaltazer: curious?
[1:02:09] dubyeh_: gems are vanilla right?? Kapp

[1:02:26] FeldyTV: good ck3 trait
[1:02:33] Deus_Vult_95: get Burgers to 60% influence and loyalty to get -10 dev cost bonus @TommyKayLIVE
[1:02:34] Ataata112: tafilalt gold mine that morocco has is broken too
[1:02:43] StannisKing: "I should stop developing"
[1:02:45] 18jsilvanuskill: @FeldyTV bets trait for dev
[1:02:49] paarthursnaax: ck2 trait
[1:02:49] GoodBoiiRey: also best trait in CK3 imo
[1:02:53] prolhty: TrollDespair
[1:02:55] Lord_Antik0r: corpos
[1:02:55] zCasi98: capitalism at it's finest
[1:02:56] Jaetsu: @Deus_Vult_95 thats to bg brain for tommy lmao
[1:02:57] Ataata112: big war in europe
[1:02:59] dubyeh_: TrollDespair
[1:03:01] imSubt1e: @sneak272 100%, barely even noticeable...depending tolerance :P lol
[1:03:01] Vimini_: always poo on company time
[1:03:02] CircleSocialClub: YEP
[1:03:08] BatsiPlays: 80 procent op the work is done by 20 procent of the people and vice versa
[1:03:10] Sweetmuff1ns: lol basically every job in US
[1:03:12] FrostBitey10: doing the least work possible thats enough is the meta
[1:03:14] daijahaden: "As long the boss makes a dollar while I make a dime, I will shit on company time"
[1:03:14] Deus_Vult_95: @Jaetsu just make him spam estates to get to it KEKW
[1:03:15] FeldyTV: @FeldyTV Yea I kinda always pick it in char creation LUL
[1:03:21] Ringull: 9,8

[1:03:25] Baldur330: Tommy spoke like a true East German
[1:03:27] discardpixel: next friday maybe Sadge
[1:03:28] zeffff2: might wanna tell enrique to fuck off
[1:03:34] bokernbabe: thats not about capitalism, thats just bad negotiations deal
[1:03:37] sneak272: @imSubt1e i get why it freaks people out though if they dont know lol. all it did for me was make me laugh easier and i felt i had more positive thoughts
[1:03:38] ZuluVlad_096: Aware
[1:03:39] GoodBoiiRey: @daijahaden well, if you dont increase your value you cant complain about it KEKW
[1:03:39] emoaltan: maybe kill your heir he is such a bad emperor
[1:03:43] George_Cullinan: chat what happened to HOI4?
[1:03:48] zCasi98: you can be the best but they most times don't care
[1:03:48] vileCreature: why didnt u do a japan game, but spain instead? @TommyKayLIVE
[1:03:55] FlyingLordDevil: it was same in communism
[1:03:56] Ambraxis: Yup
[1:03:56] Vimini_: @vileCreature not enough people
[1:03:58] WaterIsHydrating: That's like my gf, she just gets given all the worst shit to do day after day for zero extra rewards
[1:04:00] darknigh000: life meta
[1:04:00] ortodoxu: funny thing about capitalism, the more capitalism is manifested the more communist it is. I work in a company now where I see al what I saw before 89 in Romania. People doing just enough to get paid, no responsability taking and ass-licking to astronomical levels
[1:04:00] 18jsilvanuskill: wait for england to be in war then attack portugal
[1:04:04] CollinGames500: @vileCreature not enough players
[1:04:05] Sweetmuff1ns: I work in the corporate engineering world and its very true
[1:04:05] BatsiPlays: Only way to fix that in my experience is to learn as much as possible and change jobs
[1:04:05] 18jsilvanuskill: I think england is at war
[1:04:06] vileCreature: Vimini_ ty
[1:04:07] Nightbot: Join the TommyKay discord: https://discord.gg/6NxsxkQRHx
[1:04:07] zCasi98: indeed building a career
[1:04:11] vatt_ghern_: @TommyKayLIVE ProTip for more money Do you have 3rd level of government reform? if yes, pick one which gives you new edicts. Then give "Feudal Tax" edicts in all your estates.
[1:04:11] vugiiiii: did you put state edict to make renesance spread faster
[1:04:13] Sweetmuff1ns: had to change jobs 4 times in 5 years
[1:04:17] GoldFangTheDemonic: Can you curry favors with naples to break his alliances later?
[1:04:17] Belleh_: you just spoke facts @TommyKayLIVE
[1:04:18] samvortexx: change jobs every 1.5 years
[1:04:19] The_Bear_U: use diplo map mode
[1:04:19] mironp: @TommyKayLIVE  if the money is the important part for you.
[1:04:19] FlyingLordDevil: maybe in Germany
[1:04:20] Sweetmuff1ns: salary up 30%
[1:04:27] The_Yazoo: True, you use your experience to leverage a better wage in a new job, stepping stones
[1:04:28] Sweetmuff1ns: if not salary up would be like 8%
[1:04:29] Vimini_: You get the experience and demand a higher pay at a new job
[1:04:29] Kilnotik: Last year was the the first time that statistic wasn't true
[1:04:31] zCasi98: money is always important
[1:04:35] CircleSocialClub: capital accumulates wealth faster than working. so inequallity grows if not regulated
[1:04:38] Baldur330: Tommys East German roots are showing
[1:04:40] ZuluVlad_096: Money is always important, yeah
[1:04:42] TyrantMO2: Whats up TOMMYKAY
[1:04:44] 18jsilvanuskill: but ye wait for them to be like at war with france then go to war ith portugal they wont join
[1:04:46] Lord_Antik0r: only eight Aware
[1:04:51] GoodBoiiRey: its funny that its the opposite in japan and you get more the longer you work in the same company @TommyKayLIVE
[1:04:54] verdefir: Get Holly orders
[1:04:58] Ugapiku: FeelsStrongMan Clap I'm worth something
[1:05:04] IstariK: That's why Im watching Tommy during work right now
[1:05:07] ionlywatchqualitycontent: Loving the EU4 content Tommy
[1:05:13] mironp: @TommyKayLIVE I did not say it is not important for me.. KEKW  Just that maybe 10% raise for shit boss or not good team or less Home Office is not worth it
[1:05:14] tristanauftwitch: @sneak272 I don't think it's about freaking out, it's like taking medication that has not been researched well. You can't know the long term risks, or how it would affect others. Always need to add that context
[1:05:14] sneak272: best capitalism advice i ever heard was keep gaining more and more skills and your income will grow
[1:05:18] ZuluVlad_096: KEKW
[1:05:19] vatt_ghern_: It's better to be sad with money than sad without money I guess
[1:05:22] vugiiiii: did you put state edict to make renesance spread faster
[1:05:23] egb5: KEKW
[1:05:28] Thewanderingplayer: Not always. When you're a young guy coming out of university it is also important to get a lot of job experience
[1:05:30] 18jsilvanuskill: have you built markets in centers of trade?
[1:05:32] dubyeh_: @TommyKayLIVE have you heard of the people who work 2-3 jobs at the same time to maximize their wages
[1:05:32] samvortexx: I work from home so I watch Tommy every day in my room LUL
[1:05:33] zeffff2: going into debt to embrace institutions early is a good play @TommyKayLIVE
[1:05:35] sneak272: @tristanauftwitch tru and there's definitely dangers with psychedelics without a doubt
[1:05:42] Kartozeichner: Has Byz been no-cb'd?
[1:05:43] TyrantMO2: Hows the training doing Tommy?
[1:05:44] mironp: @TommyKayLIVE I did not say it is not important for me.. KEKW Just that maybe 10% raise for shit boss or not good team or less Home Office is not worth it
[1:05:44] vatt_ghern_: take loans from merchant priviliege
[1:05:45] Ugapiku: Yeah you have to
[1:05:46] Kilnotik: If you weren't a streamer what would you be doing do you think? Law still?
[1:05:48] abooba_car: I like how europeans blame everything on capitalism as if they aren't living in a socialist country
[1:05:48] vugiiiii: sell land
[1:05:48] uzaylipusat: loans tommykDARK
[1:05:50] 18jsilvanuskill: facts go into debt
[1:05:52] zCasi98: did you enacted the provinces reform for the reform spread?
[1:05:54] tristanauftwitch: Nah how much you get paid is how valuable you can make others think you are
[1:05:54] Deus_Vult_95: you can wait it will spread fast
[1:05:55] 18jsilvanuskill: your tech costs decrease
[1:05:55] verdefir: I study for exams and watch Tommy on the side
[1:05:59] bassaris1: Use the institutions state edicts to make it spread faster
[1:06:00] Ugapiku: This will give you -5% to -15% tech cost
[1:06:01] vugiiiii: SELL CROWN LAND
[1:06:01] 18jsilvanuskill: and then you cna get tech 5
[1:06:05] ZuluVlad_096: Aware
[1:06:06] Lars_Keizer: Yeah one tip I can give as a larger nation, debt isn't too bad if you can get out of it relatively easy. Institutions are important
[1:06:07] egb5: PagBounce saul goodman
[1:06:14] justsomehabibi: @TommyKayLIVE if you want to get the institution faster, there's an edict to give higher spread in provinces (it's called advancement edict i think)
[1:06:15] mahomm14: An important thing i have learned is that switching jobs every few years is quite smart cause statistclly u get more money when u swap jobs than being loyal to one employer
[1:06:21] vatt_ghern_: @TommyKayLIVE New gov, reform to choose
[1:06:24] Im_Cody: and 1.1k of us would be sad rn
[1:06:25] uzaylipusat: u should dev your gold province to 10 dev if u havent @tommykaylive

[1:06:33] 18jsilvanuskill: first sell then sieze
[1:06:35] crywo: you can take low interest loans from burghers
[1:06:35] FlyingLordDevil: Cocainum?
[1:06:35] Baldur330: ‚ÄúBetter call Tommy‚Äù
[1:06:36] Clutrike: take loans
[1:06:37] Ugapiku: sell and sieze
[1:06:39] Kartozeichner: @tommykaylive at bottom of religion interface you can set missionaries to automatically convert provinces, if you want to take away that micro
[1:06:40] Mannrik: you arent going to tech right now wait until it spreads more
[1:06:41] GoldFangTheDemonic: Sell and seize

[1:06:48] uzaylipusat: nice
[1:06:55] GoodBoiiRey: @mahomm14 you can also demand a pay raise when your boss is smart enough to want to keep you in
[1:06:58] verdefir: Sell then take lake
[1:06:59] VboyChaos: wait a bit for embrace
[1:07:03] Bayjack: Burgher loans?
[1:07:05] goldensuck1: gold does not matter, mana does
[1:07:06] Ugapiku: it's not a wasete you get -15% tech discount
[1:07:12] VboyChaos: when you gonna resarch a new tech than you embracce
[1:07:12] 18jsilvanuskill: good move
[1:07:13] zCasi98: seize back they shouldn't rebel
[1:07:24] vatt_ghern_: they will
[1:07:25] Razihel_Ita: Insult and embargo them!
[1:07:25] Thewanderingplayer: Yeah
[1:07:25] nikoIai: ü§∑ pushing the bounderies in these games is part of the fun imo
[1:07:27] zCasi98: oh yeah 49
[1:07:28] Delfrain: you got PP from outscaling Portugal
[1:07:28] The_Bear_U: yes
[1:07:28] dennisthemenace1997: @TommyKayLIVE you need to take government reforms one tier at a time
[1:07:30] mahomm14: @GoodBoiiRey yeah u can just do that as well
[1:07:31] vugiiiii: You are making big money you should focus on military more
[1:07:32] TheBr0ther: You probably eclipsed them, check power projection for modifier
[1:07:36] Kilnotik: The land I sold to you has now been seized MadgeBusiness
[1:07:38] thcgk: Portugal was too weak so you eclipsed them I think
[1:07:44] GoldFangTheDemonic: Can you curry favors with naples to break his alliances later?
[1:07:50] Jaetsu: jesus his is so behind in tech
[1:07:54] Kartozeichner: gov reform available?
[1:07:58] vatt_ghern_: @TommyKayLIVE New gov, reform to choose peepoArrive
[1:07:59] lafureur1: You also seem to have a gov reform tommy
[1:07:59] ChibiYordle: You should only need 1 tick of moral regain to kill an estate rebel but if you want to play it safe obviously wait more
[1:08:06] Nightbot: Help out this poor streamer by donating or subbing so he can get better quality for the best HOI4 gameplay.
[1:08:10] 18jsilvanuskill: when you took the institution you got more powerful wait for tech 7 mil and attack with cannons
[1:08:13] dennisthemenace1997: @TommyKayLIVE you need to take government reforms one tier at a time

[1:08:26] GoldFangTheDemonic: Free diplomats, improve with aragon or curry with naples
[1:08:29] vatt_ghern_: flagship costs 200 I think
[1:08:47] thcgk: castile doesn't have explorer flagship bonus, it's special bonus for Portugal
[1:08:50] abooba_car: Not embraced institutions get you counted less developed so when you embraced Renaissance you became too developed to have Portugal as a rival

[1:27:40] 18jsilvanuskill: 7 citie syup
[1:27:45] bardnilsen: @Clutrike Depends if you wanna play conquering. If your sole EU4 gameplay style is conquer it gets boring
[1:27:48] StraightTuna: what does a conquistador doo
[1:27:49] zCasi98: you need one colony at least
[1:27:50] LangerLachs1337: That lvl 3 Dip advisor (bettter relations) is also only half price (might even be -75%) @TommyKayLIVE so it is a good choice
[1:27:51] 18jsilvanuskill: you have to find it
[1:27:51] Shmore3: GOld is in mexico
[1:27:51] slumdwellermiguel: GOOOOOOLD

[1:27:52] cheesemaker3000: Mexico have loads of gold mines
[1:27:53] JustJuspin_: gold
[1:27:53] vatt_ghern_: @TommyKayLIVE cuz of 5-7 gold mines there
[1:27:54] JohnTheTurtleMa: Mexico has lots of gold that why
[1:27:54] Grann_1: Gold
[1:27:54] thcgk: you can find in total 7 of them, some are in south America some in north America
[1:27:56] haveanicelif3: bc the gold!!!
[1:27:56] Pharaates: gold
[1:27:58] Ugapiku: ye
[1:27:58] cheesemaker3000: gold
[1:28:00] Baldur330: this is where the game really begins
[1:28:01] LeQuebecer: @TommyKayLIVE If you conquer Mexico you get tons of gold + inflation
[1:28:01] 18jsilvanuskill: yup
[1:28:01] daijahaden: A lot of sexy native chicks in mexico + the gold
[1:28:03] Centaur_field: yeah get to mexico and peru
[1:28:04] poondanky: rush colonize eastern siberia
[1:28:06] AfAraujo: MExico and Peru is priority because of treasure fleets
[1:28:06] zCasi98: mexico is huge
[1:28:07] joaquinrogsb: yes
[1:28:08] ChibiYordle: you need to discover an coastal land tile to land there yea
[1:28:14] jdcro89: i think carribean is most important, most of the trade goes through there
[1:28:18] Delfrain: you need carribean first
[1:28:21] JC_Vertigo: Smallpox
[1:28:25] joaquinrogsb: provincias unidas del rio de la plata is still the name of argentina lol
[1:28:29] Bappus: Mexico is money boats
[1:28:31] Ugapiku: Carribean will bring you money slowly
[1:28:32] AfAraujo: caribean is improtant for trade steering
[1:28:37] slumdwellermiguel: tommy you will be swimming in so much gold that you will get more then u can spend
[1:28:41] vatt_ghern_: @TommyKayLIVE I think after you finnish colony in carribean you get perma claims on Mexico from 2 missions
[1:28:42] LangerLachs1337: The usual way is: Carribean-Mexico-Brazil- La Plata/Peru/Columbia @TommyKayLIVE
[1:28:44] ChibiYordle: Mexico is also faster to get since it is not colonizing but conquering land golden883Sip
[1:28:45] 18jsilvanuskill: seize land
[1:28:45] Lars_Keizer: Caribean are nice because it basically brings everything else within range, indeed what you said, Tenerife first to get there
[1:28:58] Robnada: One of the DLCs has a "random new world" option which is pretty fun
[1:29:00] vatt_ghern_: we see
[1:29:01] Centaur_field: cuba is a good starting iland as a base
[1:29:01] Questator: you want south and caribbean , these have trade which flows to sevilla unlike canada
[1:29:04] Clutrike: @Clutrike The purpose of the advice is to stop him from getting behind other countries. If he's not conquering, by 1600 the other great power will curb stomp him. playing wide will ALWAYS beat tall
[1:29:06] zeffff2: mexico is the richest colony overall and you can conquer it quickly all instead of having to colonize a province at a time, but you do need a port in caribbean
[1:29:21] vatt_ghern_: @TommyKayLIVE Try to colonize provinces with trade centers first
[1:29:21] Baldur330: coffe is the biggest scam in the world. it literally has 0 effect
[1:29:27] dubyeh_: USA burger mission USA
[1:29:31] esparsit: Nerdge It's pronounced Dee et

[1:29:44] 18jsilvanuskill: free oarsmen or armada is both good
[1:29:45] slumdwellermiguel: yeah ur playing very good
[1:29:49] 18jsilvanuskill: choose your naval doctrine
[1:29:56] dennisthemenace1997: @TommyKayLIVE arguably the biggest oney maker youll have as a colonizer like spain is going to be trade, pay attention to trade nodes that flow or will eventually flow down into your sevilla node
[1:29:57] 18jsilvanuskill: nvm
[1:30:03] abooba_car: @Baldur330 yeah better take heroin right?
[1:30:06] shindra_imly: you first want to colonize carribean, cuz you make stupid amounts of money
[1:30:08] fiaxfestis: Tommy, you should really try Suzerain!
[1:30:10] LangerLachs1337: Isabella is such wife material AYAYA
[1:30:13] GoldFangTheDemonic: In subject tab Siphon Income from your puppets
[1:30:15] vatt_ghern_: Personally I would attack Portugal for Porto and Ceuta provinces. After you reach good mil tech
[1:30:21] Ugapiku: True you will make ~40% of your money through trade from Carribean
[1:30:22] littlesmushroom: hi tommy tommykLOVE love to see you with 6k sub again

[1:30:40] Delfrain: you got the event for the discovery of the new world so you are first
[1:30:43] jdcro89: 6k subs what is this 2021?
[1:30:46] Baldur330: @abooba_car I didn‚Äôt mean it like that. I‚Äôm very against drugs. I just feel like coffe is overhyped
[1:30:54] zCasi98: might have happened Kappa
[1:30:56] vatt_ghern_: what's wow ? Clueless
[1:30:58] thcgk: Portugal had exploration ideas for few years already so they might be slowly trying to colonize
[1:31:00] imSubt1e: @Baldur330 nah coffee is goated
[1:31:07] Dovahdux: i think you did last night not sure tho
[1:31:13] slumdwellermiguel: yea
[1:31:17] LangerLachs1337: France can claim their ass. Time to bonk the French
[1:31:21] Delfrain: there is an estate priviledge that increases missionary strength
[1:31:21] slumdwellermiguel: they start with an explorer aswell
[1:31:22] ChibiYordle: Portugal speedrunning to the carribean at lightning speed and never getting brazil is an eu4 classic
[1:31:25] vatt_ghern_: @TommyKayLIVE you can enact missionary edict to speed up conversion
[1:31:28] koolcat201: U did 3 hours wow yesterday
[1:31:32] 18jsilvanuskill: fight tlemcen

[1:31:52] heny_cze: Check for example England if he also picked exploration ideas.
[1:31:55] Ugapiku: What's the goal for 6500 subs?
[1:32:03] The_Yazoo: You did, but some people added more
[1:32:03] zCasi98: i think you didn't
[1:32:05] LangerLachs1337: yes
[1:32:08] ChibiYordle: edicts became a LOT less annoying to deal with after the last dlc since now you can an notification that an edict can be removed and does nothing
[1:32:11] matty_2599: think you missed another 8 hours too
[1:32:11] allaindebacker: yes

[2:11:27] yuri_2599: do you have a general with siege stat? maybe you want to put him in charge of the sieging army
[2:11:30] marwanzoom: @thcgk yes but you dont need to take that attrition on the entire stack
[2:11:33] daijahaden: That portuguese navy, 2 star gen, higher dip tech. Is scary, watch it closely
[2:11:37] dutchbtw: u should let their armies cross 1 by 1 so u can call them when u have new troops
[2:11:39] Hitacha: The only downside for mistakes like this is that you postpone the snowballing. And the game in SP is very boring anyway once the snowballing begins. @TommyKayLIVE

[2:12:01] 18jsilvanuskill: take the coastline
[2:12:10] 18jsilvanuskill: yup just break alliance
[2:12:16] MissingOrange: take the province they colonized so you can get to america
[2:12:18] mako0804: Check missions

[2:12:19] Koberinoo: Whats the war goal ?
[2:12:20] cheesemaker3000: Don't take anything from portugal - including money - you want a short truce
[2:12:23] menaman8090: you can connect to the gold mine but its what we call a snake and its cringe

[2:12:44] jdcro89: dont take money, alliance only
[2:12:44] 18jsilvanuskill: yup
[2:12:45] Thewanderingplayer: no money
[2:12:49] Mannrik: no money just break alliance
[2:12:53] Excitingfrog: If you wait till mid game to fully annex portugal you gain all of their colonies for free
[2:12:53] daijahaden: Can take one of their cheap islands, so you can reach carribean
[2:12:53] zeffff2: don't take money so the truce is shorter
[2:12:54] BaconatorCombo: war reps
[2:12:55] thcgk: try to get as few things as possible to finish truce with them asap
[2:12:57] yuri_2599: @dutchbtw he already ahs land in morocco

[2:13:13] klrsKevin: I tried to learn this game but Its so much things to learn
[2:13:14] ReKetuh: everything that costs warscore extends truce
[2:13:14] esparsit: That way the truce is only 6 years
[2:13:15] dutchbtw: yes but then he can lock troops @yuri_2599
[2:13:15] ChibiYordle: yes next war you PU them instead
[2:13:19] yuri_2599: 16 years is enough
[2:13:21] Deus_Vult_95: you want the truce to be shorter than the time when he can ally again
[2:13:23] zeffff2: that annull alliance won't last forever
[2:13:23] xyuke: force break alliance with england tho
[2:13:30] 65th_hammy: @TommyKayLIVE no general on lisbon siege?
