[3:21:31] Bootch: very nice
[3:21:45] gnominatorka5: cant you switch layer
[3:21:45] ventmario5: isnt that the retail sharding thing?
[3:21:47] Istunlocklocalpensioners: I mean they could even merge the servers with sharding right?
[3:21:54] mmxxkbb: also they should add a boss at every altar in stv event
[3:21:55] Bootch: OhISee retail
[3:21:55] radassbadass69: the only reason they dont want to do sharding is so people dont cross zone lines to escape wpvp
[3:21:57] AdamdsTV: Is that hunter a bot
[3:22:04] Istunlocklocalpensioners: but actually we need to be careful not to turn it into retail
[3:22:05] Beertje90: @mmxxkbb layering is actually sharding with some tweaks
[3:22:11] Istunlocklocalpensioners: because sharding can become annoying asf
[3:22:15] gnominatorka5: but whit 6k ally
[3:22:20] Istunlocklocalpensioners: seeing people disappear and reappear etc
