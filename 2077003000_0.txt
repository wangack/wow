[2:55:59] ren0m: I have a question about gearing. M+ gives you max 470 iLvL items, which can go up to 483. So the only way to get the best gear is through Vault? Or am I missing something.
[2:56:34] CyonDru: @ren0m vault or M raid(489)  + crafting(486)
[2:56:40] kelly_mac06: yup
[2:56:44] kelly_mac06: what Cyon said
[2:56:52] CyonDru: @kelly_mac06 gm!! jdotbComfy
[2:57:03] ren0m: So basically I should raid if I want great gear by the end of the season.
[2:57:26] kelly_mac06: @CyonDru morning!
[2:57:44] kelly_mac06: @ren0m you can rely on just the GV but that's a slower road
[2:57:46] CyonDru: @ren0m that or vault luck + crafted gear. since we have like a boat load of sparks now
[2:57:56] ren0m: The goal is to hit 3k, but I doubt people invite players who are around 480.
[2:57:58] FinkTV: @ren0m no just run 18-20 that gear you get from the vault can be upgraded to 489
[2:58:19] CyonDru: @ren0m just push your own key. that is what i always recommend
[2:58:25] CyonDru: if you dont get invites that is
[2:58:29] ren0m: Not a bad idea
[2:59:06] ren0m: I switched to DPS and now I know how much tougher it is to get invited :P
[3:10:09] kelly_mac06: @ren0m ye the LFG queues can suck as dps but you should be able to easily hit 3k this season
[3:10:48] ren0m: @kelly_mac06 thank you for believing in me :D
[3:12:57] ren0m: I'm not one to blame teammates, but from the runs I've done recently, it feels like people who I ran 15s with play better than those who do 18-20s. Weird.

[5:59:19] sketch223: if u get charged twice u die

[6:01:02] tvilk: having a general idea of when damage comes is nice with the timer imo
[6:01:04] sketch223: bc if hes calling for dmg on pip and melee go across the room away from the bear soak ppl gonna miss the soak and when the bear hits the wall ppl will die

[7:22:26] sketch223: if i was an evoker id be looking to spacial the priest everytime there were swirlies on the ground
[7:23:12] reippailija: if i was an aug evoker, i'd ask you to shoot me in the head
