Apart from that it doesnt stress you out if you loose. You just focus more on the game and your skill than on your rank and the points you are loosing or winning each game.  It actl lowers stress.

[4:12:30] LaserGuidedTacos: For people who want to know about the fight they are about to do. Theres 3 small dragons around the map which you can kill before you attack the big drake in middle to make the fight easier. But you get less loot. If you let them all live they will join the fight and make it harder.

[4:25:40] WickedmageX: Dodge big flame xdd
[4:25:47] Sverr_WoW: @shroud make sure the dps is positioned to dps the 1st dragon asap, you have about 5 seconds you can dps him at the beginning before he starts to move
[4:25:47] hashyfruitcake: well it's better that they don't touch the boss at all at the start only tank taking it to it's spot, kinda waste of trinkets procs on that, just wait for the first drake to spawn pop personals with trinks procs, 2nd lust aand 3rd survive
[4:25:50] ccirG: Does he play this game every day or ? chat
[4:25:52] jordinross: 3 D or no balls

[4:26:45] eskodas: @per0ken sure whatever that means
[4:26:47] SpYdota2: some used cd s for sartha, they should save everything to burst 1st drake
[4:26:50] Facyu: go go go

[4:34:10] per0ken: @shroud this fight is mainly focusing on small adds, 3rd tank really have to watch out for elementals, if they get hit by fire wall they get enrage and become insanely powerful, also raid should not attack sartharion at the start so they have their proccs avaialble on first tenebron, full cd on tenebron and you can burst shadron during bloodlust, if you survive all the 3 drakes sartharion is easy
[4:34:20] LaserGuidedTacos: get the rogues to trick you when all the adds spawn

[6:45:51] jesusjokerr: @PhazeeD thanks bro
[6:46:13] per0ken: @shroud but the fact why u cant solo tank is, Patchwerks cleaves the highest health melee player (except the one he is targeting) even if they are behind he will rotate
[6:46:37] Tobssessxic: KEKW
[6:46:38] cheeseburgur97: the most tankest must be off-tank

[6:46:49] LoLNukeLoL: You can solo tank it with no melee with you right?
[6:46:49] sicklys: lucky
[6:46:51] nemzky: you solo tanked it with zero melee in range?
[6:46:51] RealHoid: You can't solo tank it with other melee, but you can solo tank it
[6:46:51] fujihd: @per0ken you can indeed solo tank this fight very easily
[6:46:54] namzayin: @shroud solo tank from 100%hp?
[6:46:58] eggdizzle: i think 10 man is soloable, just not 25 man, in 25 man the hatefuls hit too hard

[6:48:29] fujihd: Can you check the death log on the tank tanking the hatefuls? I'm willing to bet he got no heals @shroud
[6:48:29] grimmzy: @RealHoid that would wipe threat and not make them a target
[6:48:34] Lesterr420: easier and faster to switch tanks more geared is offtank

[6:50:32] Death_Dono: @grimmzy  so they can just let the Ranged do dps for like 10 seconds and melee start later no?
[6:50:33] Tyotte: Does Hurtful Strike do more dmg then he does on you? Like is it harder to recieve that then to maintank @shroud
[6:50:36] sicklys: leeroy omg
[6:50:39] Shvartsee: @grimmzy it is based of aggro and current HP not just aggro purely. That is why melee has to dip in slime from time to time

[6:51:19] grimmzy: @Death_Dono Nope. No melee at all. If there's *any* target in range of melee on Patchwerk with threat, it'll hit them.
[6:51:43] granolafiend: you can't get undying once ulduar releases
[6:51:45] criolool: you need the whole raid to be focus
[6:51:47] TheFubz: one void fissure
[6:51:49] Tyotte: Couldnt the feral just maintank and you take the Hurtful? @shroud
[6:51:56] RealHoid: You can't get the mount after ulduar comes out (which is the 310 mount for *free*)
[6:51:58] sicklys: u will get to this poinnt

[8:23:50] its_me_yul: people wanted the classic version of wow rather than the current version
[8:23:52] subtoxiic: welcome to your first day on the internet Jbr

[8:24:53] xAWebb: @shroud you just rotate like a clock clockwise positive rotates through boss to negative and negative rotates below boss so they never touch
[8:25:03] falconwing_: @third_iteration exactly this
[8:25:11] lceWoIf: their DPS is good enough they dont necessarily NEED the buff
[8:25:16] DocAllen8404: @shroud its just doing the mechanic

[8:39:35] JBonezey: treat it like a circle, everyone goes right
[8:39:41] DocAllen8404: The only thing that triggers the achievment failing is someone registering damage from the mechanic
[8:39:42] its_me_yul: just limit test it 1st try
[8:39:43] Regalya: You have 3 secs tho if you moev as you get it should never dmg to eachother even if you pass through eachother
[8:39:51] Brolli912: undying super hard, I dc'd during this boss and lost it for my guild back in the day :(
[8:40:05] Quakezilla69: follow boat rules. always move right with someone coming at you
[8:40:06] MajurDJ: it does not fail if you cross, you just have to be quick, and melee have to be MAX melee range to make sure they arent cleaving each other through the boss
[8:40:14] Darkni1: then you still have to spread, since you swap when he switch. Since you can stand on top of eachother
[8:40:15] MajurDJ: i did this on 10 man and we crossed and got the achieve
[8:40:28] skulldrip: thats how i did this achieve
[8:40:29] ZachKeys: it doesn't really matter that much does it? we never rotate a certain way lmao

[8:41:19] falconwing_: you can keep the boss in the same place
[8:41:25] MajurDJ: the biggest issue is melee "hugging" boss and being to close on opposite sides. they gotta be absolute max melee range

[8:47:52] lceWoIf: those who change just go left :P
[8:47:58] Ino145: Stack at the right side of the boss then you can move forward. At the start, inline with boss
[8:47:59] nefarious010: i don't remember this being that complicated
[8:48:01] yannie791: ahh yes the solo
[8:48:17] flashnickgg: @bengalbroys peepoBlush
[8:48:18] ForumTroll: they cant change polarity guys for the achievement they cant go always right :P
[8:48:29] DeleldurTV: I think they way you do this if i remember back from when i did it, NOT everyone gets a shift in polarity, so if you are in the minus group and you get + rather then crossing the boss you just run away from the - stack and spread,  less people, have the buffs but its safer that way
[8:48:29] MajurDJ: on details go to "damage taken by spell" for your thaddius pulls
[8:48:43] cakeslolz: @shroud questie bugs out achievements. Debuffs take like 3 secs to go out
[8:48:49] ZGarza33: I have same addon it does fail sometimes had it happen a couple times
[8:48:55] MajurDJ: if anyone has taken damage from "negative charge" or "positive charge" then you fail. if not then you're fine. the addon saying you failed may be wrong
[8:49:02] just9n: pp poo poo
[8:49:07] daspaz: damage taken by source is its own category
[8:49:11] Jaxthrax2151: static
[8:49:12] gkirbyou: dumb question: was thay destiny talking?
[8:49:16] Jaxthrax2151: thats the dmg
[8:49:18] flip_sanderss: wikBIRTHDAY wikBIRTHDAY
[8:49:27] anthony_p_g: @just9n big if true
[8:49:29] MajurDJ: right click where it says "damage done", it will be the bottom option in the first column
[8:49:30] gatorwow: doesn't matter they wiped took damage intentionally too late to check
[8:49:39] folkron: get the addon instance achievement tracker to track this stuff easily if you want
[8:49:42] xHitchcock: addon wrong i think
[8:49:44] omathon: so i just watched the achievement from back in the day and people just  ran through
[8:49:51] koonargh: /range 10 easy peasy
[8:50:01] DocAllen8404: You will touch them when polarity shifts with the logic you guys are using
[8:50:11] Sluggs_: thats how it worked back in wotlk it was just dont hit someone
[8:50:14] clyde_jenkins: have you watched a 10min youtube vid?
[8:50:14] foxyvexx: Good morning shroud
[8:50:21] xHitchcock: watched the same video just now
[8:50:27] cakeslolz: @shroud questie bugs achieve tracking
[8:50:31] Peezo425: yes
[8:50:32] koonargh: or here is the more likely scenario, blizzard fucked it
[8:50:36] greasesausage: yes u cant cross
[8:50:42] MajurDJ: right click where it says "damage done", it will be the bottom option in the first column
[8:50:43] mrnemesis_x: crossed the streams
[8:50:45] Peezo425: you cant cross paths
[8:50:51] MajurDJ: if anyone has taken damage from "negative charge" or "positive charge" then you fail. if not then you're fine. the addon saying you failed may be wrong
[8:50:53] Hotsauce311: you cant cross paths
[8:51:03] OG__HELLFIRE: to do this fight, everyone stacks left and right of the mob. if you get negative you walk left, if positive you go right. as long as your people know their left from their right they'll be ok.
[8:51:04] DocAllen8404: yes you will lolol
[8:51:08] domGrtz: dont cross paths
[8:51:11] zev319: just do a circle path
[8:51:13] Skeedleedle: U faild b4 dmg could even go out
[8:51:14] DocAllen8404: someone will get neg and someone else will get pos
[8:51:15] white_boi_speedy: just swing super wide when swapping sides normally, we just did it and it was easy. Everyone goes to their right
[8:51:16] koonargh: walk around clock wise
[8:51:23] Mistahspleef: can a pentiumR silver N5000 cpu 1.10ghz run WoW?
[8:51:27] MajurDJ: crossing each other is completely irrelevant i promise, i can link you the achieve and linkl you the logs so you can watch the replay where we did it on 10 man
[8:51:39] Zarlus: Picture... a magnet
[8:51:45] danzi011: @keyrihh Opie is the addon
[8:51:48] OG__HELLFIRE: you guys are over thinking it
[8:51:49] JerseyBricklayer: j9 <3 shroudLove
[8:51:54] moez_id: @Mistahspleef never
[8:51:55] OG__HELLFIRE: Rotate outside of the boss
[8:52:01] DongsAreVeryExciting: don't you just spread and never move?
[8:52:04] OG__HELLFIRE: negative goes left, postive goes right
[8:52:10] OG__HELLFIRE: move every charge
[8:52:13] vinay_05: have you seen new harbor trailer
[8:52:25] Regalya: Only the damage that counts get get achivement tracker or smh you can see it on it only fails if the damage dealth.
[8:52:33] Sluggs_: you could only have 1 tank and 1 melee if thats how iot worked its not how that works
[8:52:39] daspaz: a comment on wowhead says they didnt get achieve even though they didnt take damage
[8:52:40] OG__HELLFIRE: and by left and right, i mean YOUR right.
[8:52:40] Blokane: supahm1Hype
[8:52:44] skulldrip: pretty sure somone got shocked last time, i think ghazzy got ticked at the end
[8:52:50] OG__HELLFIRE: not the position on the map
[8:52:51] Ghost051: @BlackHolesAreFake if you spread you don't get the damage buff and you'll hit enrage timer.
[8:52:54] xJohnny023: i havent played wotlk for so long and i still remebmer the tactic :'D
[8:52:58] natankoa: !server
[8:53:00] xJohnny023: its so simple
[8:53:14] Regalya: @daspaz shielded or inmunity through not taking dmg sitll fails the achievement it just doesnt have to hit other people
[8:53:19] omathon: so have the groups stack diagonal from each other, if you get it run across then go join the group
[8:53:24] OG__HELLFIRE: lmao this is painful to watch XD
[8:53:47] thed0w: when moving between zones, just move around it in a clockwise rotation, therefore no one will cross over each other
[8:53:50] StreamElements: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[8:53:51] songlokdong: 2 stacks of positive 2 neg?
[8:53:58] OG__HELLFIRE: Everyone stays stacked. Positive goes right negative goes left
[8:54:08] OG__HELLFIRE: you have 2 seconds before the zap hits and it kills the achievement
[8:54:15] Fatallife22: he doesnt get it lol
[8:54:19] OG__HELLFIRE: AAAAAAAAAAA
[8:54:26] OG__HELLFIRE: Gazzy goes left
[8:54:31] OG__HELLFIRE: you go right
[8:54:41] Peezo425: @OG__HELLFIRE there trying for the achev
[8:54:47] OG__HELLFIRE: yeah i know
[8:54:49] DongsAreVeryExciting: you just can't get zapped??
[8:54:53] OG__HELLFIRE: i've got all of these chieves
[8:54:55] thed0w: nooooooo
[8:54:56] xHairyKabeb: shut up
[8:54:59] quackerjack: You guys are over complicating the shit out of this.
[8:54:59] NOHITJEROME: this is clearly 100% impossible
[8:55:03] Ghost051: 100% the addon is broken. You guys are thinking way too hard. All that matters is that you don't take damage. The path you take is completely irrelevant.
[8:55:05] Ino145: Doesn't it "activate" a second later? You just gotta be fast.
[8:55:05] wh1sk3yp3t3: do you need to stay spread out at all times?
[8:55:06] danzi011: jfc this is awful
[8:55:08] spydersm: @NOHITJEROME KEKW
[8:55:10] ethansann: !crosshair

[8:55:12] shadorien: shroud trying to solve problem solved 15 years ago LUL
[8:55:14] just9n: ????????
[8:55:17] thed0w: Just move clockwise around the boss KEKW
[8:55:19] ToeKnee147: acheviement is tied to damage not touching, you have 3ish seconds from his cast
[8:55:21] talamah: now we're gaming
[8:55:24] xHairyKabeb: shut up, im tryna watch
[8:55:25] OG__HELLFIRE: ino yes, you have a couple seconds
[8:55:29] General_HAM: WAYTOODANK

[8:55:31] MajurDJ: can i post the link of our replay from warcraft logs? we did normal strat and got it no problem
[8:55:34] gobleys: WAYTOODANK
[8:55:34] DongsAreVeryExciting: WAYTOODANK
[8:55:34] third_iteration: Just kill the boss before he casts polarity shift 5Head
[8:55:36] just9n: u have time before u get zapped
[8:55:36] Ghost051: @wh1sk3yp3t3 There's a damage buff for the same charges to stack, and without it, the boss will enrage.
[8:55:37] BigVlass: just pass on the right from wherever you are lmao
[8:55:37] OG__HELLFIRE: Pay attention to me shroud sempai
[8:55:37] SMOKERmvp: put down RAID MARKS for shifting sides
[8:55:39] ggGiggles: You're overthinking it, it should break the acheve only on damage
[8:55:40] skulldrip: making it like 100x than it is
[8:55:40] just9n: its not immediate touching
[8:55:42] dovahkin1269: just rotate right or left
[8:55:42] nefarious010: wtf is this? i thought you just couldn't mix pos and negative folks
[8:55:46] LinksmutisLt: why dont they just stands next to each other in a line and not cross on top when moving lmao
[8:55:50] OG__HELLFIRE: postives go right, negatives go left
[8:55:57] songlokdong: yes you just do it normally...
[8:55:58] murribur: KEKW
[8:55:59] OG__HELLFIRE: ez clap
[8:55:59] just9n: lol
[8:55:59] Firebreather: KEKW
[8:56:01] DocAllen8404: @shroud yay not getting banned! lol
[8:56:02] bengalbroys: KEKW
[8:56:07] omathon: the achievement is just real hit or miss
[8:56:10] xJohnny023: hahahahahaha
[8:56:13] ogsplashgods: this is not normally at ALL
[8:56:13] just9n: im so shoced u guys didnt know that
[8:56:14] MajurDJ: just ignore your addon, as long as you're quick, and max melee range, you're fine
[8:56:16] Sluggs_: got one guyed by an addon
[8:56:16] xJohnny023: that was funnY
[8:56:17] JayPuppa: this is wrong. and it's laughable.
[8:56:18] just9n: shocked*
[8:56:18] Ghost051: You have 2 seconds to change sides before damage ticks. It's that simple.
[8:56:21] just9n: see what i did there
[8:56:23] MajurDJ: i literally did it on monday
[8:56:25] zev319: gotem kap
[8:56:27] its_me_yul: mission failed, we'll get em next time :
[8:56:30] FritosCrunch: yeah i saw
[8:56:36] ItsJustLooney: @just9n i see what you did there
[8:56:39] Sergling: shielded damage still fails it, dont shield anyone but tank
[8:56:43] just9n: :)
[8:56:43] Sluggs_: it didnt fail
[8:56:44] Ghost051: The addon is broken, yea.
[8:56:45] zev319: which addon told u u failed
[8:56:46] OG__HELLFIRE: everyone ran through the middle as well
[8:56:49] xJohnny023: u didnt fail probably.
[8:56:49] DocAllen8404: Just watch hp bars, if anyone takes damage during polarity shift, you need to wipe
[8:56:57] OG__HELLFIRE: the addon could be broken, but don't run THROUGH him
[8:56:57] daspaz: instance achievement tracker @zev319
[8:57:05] Firebreather: standup gig when @just9n
[8:57:08] OG__HELLFIRE: go around him to the left and right
[8:57:10] foxyvexx: it's more likely for the addon to be wrong, if you did it before, you know what to do ezpz
[8:57:11] just9n: :)
[8:57:13] Firebreather: :)
[8:57:17] ItsJustLooney: :)
[8:57:18] smuppers: :)
[8:57:24] just9n: everyone smile now :)
[8:57:26] MajurDJ: i think the addon is simply measuring if any opposing charges are within 10 yards at any point, which is different than taking damage from the debuff
[8:57:31] FritosCrunch: :)
[8:57:31] bengalbroys: :)
[8:57:36] shadowperfects: :)
[8:57:37] Ghost051: @MajurDJ exactly.
[8:57:38] ogsplashgods: strap on is in
[8:57:39] NOHITJEROME: this is gonna go perfectly
[8:57:42] Sluggs_: should have friendly fire shown so you see if it fails

[8:59:16] Sluggs_: ranged actually trolling
[8:59:18] Ghost051: casters nees to be stacked for damage buff
[8:59:22] Skeedleedle: Boomy stack

[8:59:52] OG__HELLFIRE: tank him out in the open
[9:00:03] OG__HELLFIRE: if you get negative go left, if you get positive go to the right
