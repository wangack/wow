[1:32:45] Salanzo: yea how tf did you fix gladius
[1:32:49] RogueStabin: I was doing some testing on the numbers with the evis nerf and it’s not looking good for sub at all
[1:33:17] Salanzo: 10% nerf to eviscerate only "not looking good for subs at all" lol
[1:33:21] anotherdayanotherbeer77: is this song by nvellen  ?
[1:33:42] DirtyYankee0: 10% = not looking good KEKW
[1:34:09] bigbootybaddie: @salanzo disable power bars?
[1:34:13] VitoBambino: @RogueStabin appreciate the insight but eviscerate is not what makes sub rogue strong lmao
[1:34:29] Twonkey9: are you gonna spin the wheel today?
[1:34:30] Salanzo: its more likely that the buffs to stamina and armor play a bigger factor than just a measley 10% nerf to evisc lol
[1:34:32] sparqTTV: yes it is
[1:34:34] sparqTTV: rofl
[1:34:44] sparqTTV: evis is a huge part
[1:34:46] DirtyYankee0: yeah  massive evicerate was a big part of sub
[1:34:58] DirtyYankee0: Is I should say
[1:35:01] Vendrek: Is it going to be 10% from baseline or current state?
[1:35:08] Laythos: is this the outro song?!? Pog
[1:35:09] BusterNaught: sub will go back to doing sub things.. controlling.
[1:35:12] mahtrousersnake: sub has plenty of tools and evis is one of them so i would be really surprised if it wasnt noticeable
[1:35:13] BusterNaught: rather than 1 shotting
[1:35:27] DirtyYankee0: baseline -10% dmg @Vendrek
[1:35:32] sparqTTV: yep. stun bot
[1:35:33] sparqTTV: rip
[1:35:43] hazardouds: is bleed dmg affected alot by armor or not?
[1:35:52] Vendrek: @DirtyYankee0 yikes that is going to hurt for sure
[1:35:56] Jasonclownking: pikabooAh
[1:35:56] suprakhal: Is Sleepihead a monk?
[1:35:57] DirtyYankee0: no it issnt
[1:36:11] mahtrousersnake: yeah dont think itll make them unviable or anything but itll change their role for sure
[1:36:16] DirtyYankee0: The armor and stamina change is the biggest change for sub
[1:36:31] DirtyYankee0: but every melee is affected by that
[1:36:36] thywo: @anotherdayanotherbeer77 yes, it is "the wind"
[1:36:44] z1nsTV: poor cdew
