[1:08:11] bastianCx: lock without death coil feels o bad LUL
[1:08:14] EilasRS: @JokerdTV i think lake of fire itself is a really nice buff of course, but the fact that you have to cast rain of fire on single target dosent make much sense tbh, coundlt thye atleast make it a spell we use or has more use
[1:08:16] DerDofe1: summon the bozos in your raid is fun!!! UltraMad
[1:08:20] realpan114: so its wotlk at lvl 60?

[1:10:29] shadotdow: @tiguricus i am very annoyed by your nonsense spams, it covers the whole chat
[1:10:37] cloakofmoon: @Aalee yea i know but since it gives fire dmg% buff it feels more like a buff to keep up rather than a spell to spam

[2:36:17] chr47: worldquests suck ass
[2:36:18] varkshot: WQs are better than daily quests
[2:36:19] mr_az3k: WoD was a decade ago KEKW
[2:36:22] snorkle0: WQs in legion were great especially with the addon to auto form group. They were completed in seconds
[2:36:26] neejla: thats only because you play 20 alts

[2:38:12] varkshot: Yeah @jokerdtv your perspective on game play is based on you playing 20 alts most players don't pay that way, your perspective might change if you played a main and an alt or two.

[4:33:26] gxniusx: its perfect imo
[4:33:29] Epixil: hey jokerdtv best leveling talents?
[4:33:30] varl0m: too long for terminally online ppl

[4:33:51] Oopogo1: problem is the other bliz games suck lol
[4:33:51] Trastar12: yeah its too long, but maybe its intended so that not only progress player reach 60 and raid without the andys?
[4:33:52] NINCOMPOOP__DUDE: LIVESFROMBASED
[4:33:52] fidd1efunk: The problem with tthat thinking is obvious
[4:33:54] photek_tn: Maybe its just fine, and players that want to test multiple toons are given enough time to decide what their main is.
[4:33:59] sickmode__: nah thats perfect time - i mean some people want to try out more than 1 2 3 classes with the runes so i think its o

[4:34:28] boopbopbamski: Aggrend siad in a interview they want SOD to be a game you can leave and come back and play they dont want it to be one where you play 18+ hours a day and burn out and the main reason they have the level brackets ;)
[4:34:35] fidd1efunk: the problem with that thinking is that any version of wow completely consumes you. There is no reason to assume that SoD wouldn't be grinded... its just dumb on their part lol
[4:34:40] huckleson: @Kushiize not getting lucky with raid gear does not = content lol
[4:34:48] flipflopbob: @jokerdtv does rogues spend thair points at 5 or less?
[4:34:53] chr47: tbh it gets boring also because a lot of classes don't have core abilities yet, so PVP, etc. is trash
[4:34:55] g0dzilla: @mikeyzee so ur opinion doesnt count... caus you are maybe 1 of 1% or let it be 10% of the playerbase...

[4:37:36] fidd1efunk: Well idk, do you see the best players in the game "playing casually"? No of course not. Bc if you want to be good you hjave to grind. If you talking about playing casual you probably ass at the game, duel me.
[4:37:40] mikeyzee: @g0dzilla  because the 10% are the ones that actually play? why wud they cate for people that barely play the game? wtf is ur logic lmao
[4:37:46] giv____: do you think living flame will ever be unlocked?

[4:37:57] butterzugzug: @YuruNeko1 fun mode? a game should always be fun anyway? whats the point in this argument?
[4:38:00] Neggs15: they’re still fixing the game too. no point in rushing the next phase when it’s still being fleshed out

[4:38:01] mikeyzee: @g0dzilla  they cater to whoever is permantly buying game time, they dnt give af about casuals that barely play????
[4:38:06] grylz89: I think sod is the future, sprinkle in a og vanilla fresh every few years ofc, but building out classic + is where it's at! The base game of vanilla is simply lightning in a bottle. @jokerdtv

[4:39:03] nssb89034236: Is fire or arcane better on mage
