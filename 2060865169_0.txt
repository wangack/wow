But I am sorry to say I don't think I can allow you to join our group. From what I'm looking at your weiner is massive. I mean the sheer girth and juiciness alone is ridiculous. It looks as if someone glued a forearm to the bottom of your torso. You can probably stand on it like a tripod. And that's not even mentioning how fat your nuts are.

[4:10:24] Wolfatoms: Class Adjustments  We intend to follow our once-per-week class adjustment schedule and take the time needed with class adjustments to not make too many changes too hastily, particularly when it comes to power reduction or ‚Äúnerfs‚Äù. You can expect to see the first full round of class adjustments arrive with weekly maintenance in your region during the week of Feb 20th.

[4:10:57] Wolfatoms: The base damage of Starsurge has been reduced by 30%. Additionally, we‚Äôve identified and fixed a bug in the Starsurge spellpower coefficient and this has now been corrected. Starsurge should be properly gaining 42.9% of spellpower as damage now, as intended. To compensate for this adjustment, we will be adding an additional effect to Starsurge that causes your next Starfire to cause 66% additional damage.

[6:57:02] hexmark42: Blizz unlock ALLY on CS
[6:57:04] hexmark42: i beg
[6:57:05] Curtsy: @BronyAlex that's how classic has been for 20 years
[6:57:16] BronyAlex: I'm new to WoW, only been playing since HC KEKW
[6:57:20] peardraxz: was you in rain of fire?
[6:57:29] hoopyfrood12: what is the crit chance though
[6:57:32] hoopyfrood12: surely its only like 10%
[6:57:32] Kurama__95: om

[6:57:49] Rightofdeath: huh dude makes a party for a dungeon farm group, we blast the dungeon, he leaves after last boss
[6:57:59] hexmark42: @Savix whats the best lvling addon?
[6:58:05] veiloflonelystars: @Curtsy on the list of current complain they aren't up so EZ
[6:58:08] floddd: man i just want a streamer read my massage loud so sad
[6:58:28] Kurama__95: @floddd You have to pay for that, sir bingusbusiness
[6:58:39] hoppo0815: SavixJammer SavixJammer SavixJammer
[6:58:50] Kurama__95: savixmuhsin
[6:58:51] Madwo: borJam
[6:58:52] Webbyster_: What is the loot Mr. Savvy Savix got outta gnomeland?
[6:58:59] Nen0x: you running art of war and sheath of light from the new runes or?
[6:59:39] Tropicocity: I just did 4 gnome bosses, got the set chest token on a need or greed, and also the paladin/resto shaman epic shield :D
[6:59:39] melvinguyy: did u clear gnomer?
[6:59:44] Nen0x: aight thanks
[6:59:52] hexmark42: @Savix whats the best lvling addon?
[6:59:53] KaizeeRx: JUDGE now do this solo
[6:59:59] Scrublordrl: ashen was kinda booty, it lost novelty quick
[7:00:04] Kurama__95: Doing this solo is cbt LULW
[7:00:06] BronyAlex: To the warriors in chat, is dual wield warrior fine? Or best to stick with 2h?
[7:00:11] babawes: have you seen the big troll guy yet? you get more coins if you're close to him
[7:00:27] Curtsy: It's only fun if you go against the spirit of it being FFA, grouping is the only real way to do this
[7:00:31] hoopyfrood12: people pay for rested xp?
[7:00:33] twitch4home007: i thought paid addons violated the tos?
[7:00:47] Deadge_Gartic: i thought this even supposed to be ffa
[7:00:48] Tropicocity: @hoopyfrood12 youtubers and some streamers are sponsored by them with a discount code
[7:00:48] KaizeeRx: @BronyAlex more gear = prolly dual wield better less gear 2h prolly better
[7:00:59] Arturius77: @twitch4home007 The addon is free the guides cost $$
[7:01:01] Curtsy: @twitch4home007 That's been a loophole for 20 years, the addon is free but the optional guides are not or some shit
[7:01:07] BronyAlex: @KaizeeRx alrite, thanks :D
[7:01:07] babawes: 15 stacks instead of 5 per kill close to troll
[7:01:12] coitomann: Got any loot from the raid? @savix
[7:01:14] Kurama__95: @twitch4home007 It's a weird gray area they're working with, lawyer talk around the ToS
[7:01:17] insaniacc_: 5 or 6 per player, 1 per mob
[7:01:18] twitch4home007: lol oh ok
[7:01:19] CptArne: 7
[7:01:36] niveous_a: he has like 3mil hp
[7:01:44] iinthebushes: boss has 3.6 mil hp or something
[7:01:47] kyoffeee: Did Savix manage to clear last boss?
[7:01:51] insaniacc_: it went fine, we ended without killing last boss. We had issue with keeping tank up
[7:01:53] KaizeeRx: nah gfuck em up man
[7:01:53] Deadge_Gartic: @kyoffeee yes
[7:01:57] KaizeeRx: if u were alone they would jump u
[7:01:58] insaniacc_: he was getting 1000-1200 dmg per hit
[7:02:00] Tropicocity: that tauren is so happy
[7:02:01] Tropicocity: LOL
[7:02:01] hexmark42: how long do they normally keep factions locked?
[7:02:04] kyoffeee: Congratulations!
[7:02:18] insaniacc_: yeah
[7:02:21] Scrublordrl: blood moon every 3 hours? how long does it last
[7:02:26] insaniacc_: he got completely rekt
[7:02:28] Deadge_Gartic: bean wasnt getting that chunked savix
[7:02:36] Curtsy: @hexmark42 they randomly unlock them, but they stay unlocked for like 15 mins or some shit because people rush to make characters
[7:02:42] cronussss: what buff did u boon?
[7:02:46] Webbyster_: yea I was tanking my run, shit hits so HARD
[7:02:48] Deadge_Gartic: @insaniacc_ was your tank hybrid ?
[7:02:49] insaniacc_: idk if its warr issue, or gear issue, but he was getting smacked too hard
[7:03:00] insaniacc_: yeah he was fury prot i think
[7:03:02] hexmark42: @Curtsy ahh thanks any idea best tank this phase?
[7:03:04] Tropicocity: Even the dragonling at 5th boss was hitting me for 450-500
[7:03:04] BronyAlex: ya
[7:03:05] Deadge_Gartic: thats the issue probably
[7:03:13] FeralTami: WOAW Stab savixDespair
[7:03:15] Doctorbac0n: like 11500
[7:03:19] Deadge_Gartic: @insaniacc_ seems like till gearing up this raid needs people commiting their role
[7:03:22] iinthebushes: 11500 i think
[7:03:27] Glathus: 45k for rank 56
[7:03:29] Glathus: 5
[7:03:39] hexmark42: whats the best tank currently chat?
[7:03:40] impkapp: @FeralTami WOAW
[7:03:43] LyteGod: Train

[7:03:44] kyoffeee: iitll be a lot easier wit hpvp
[7:03:51] floddd: how much is the mount
[7:03:51] Tropicocity: @hexmark42 shaman
[7:03:55] insaniacc_: @Deadge_Gartic yeah, its just the last boss, he smacked like no other. I think you need an actual proper proper deep tank for it

[7:04:18] FeralTami: FlowerCatJAM
[7:04:19] Curtsy: @hexmark42 I think it depends on what you are doing, shaman seems great for 5man content but warlock is great for the raid it seems
[7:04:27] KaizeeRx: war weapon is ass

[7:04:45] daveyddz: daveyddz subscribed at Tier 1. 
[7:04:45] hexmark42: @Curtsy i was thinking maybe war or druid geuss they suck?
[7:04:53] KaizeeRx: @OniLinux the mount GIGA
[7:05:07] insaniacc_: @Deadge_Gartic Eh, theres not alot of tanking gear around currently, its just stam and agi stacking
[7:05:20] Deadge_Gartic: @insaniacc_ there is plate gear available tho
[7:05:25] StreamElements: If you enjoy the content check out my other stuff! https://linktr.ee/Savixwastaken
[7:05:26] Curtsy: @hexmark42 Not sure about warrior but I think druid tank didn't really get that many good runes, but its of course still viable
[7:05:27] WookieliciousTV: wait, so u need 100 copper coins for one silver coin and 100 silver coin for 1 gold coin??
[7:05:40] WookieliciousTV: thats so much grind
[7:05:41] insaniacc_: @Deadge_Gartic oh yeah i dont think he was full plate yet

[7:10:14] Tropicocity: @Deadge_Gartic i just reread, the starsurge nerf was actually a huge nerf lol

[7:10:46] insaniacc_: we were all fire
[7:10:50] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix feels like having feral is waste tbh LULW dps you guys gain from wf dont add up to having boomy instead om
[7:10:51] insaniacc_: ignite was ticking for 1k
