[11:00:39] Retcon__: Prevention is best
[11:00:43] Koffiekoekje: idk F11 seems pretty useful vs frostbite
[11:00:45] officialpekken: Minor frostbite can be treated at home with basic first-aid measures. For all other frostbite, after appropriate first aid and assessment for hypothermia, treatment may involve rewarming, medications, wound care, surgery and various therapies, depending on the severity of your injury. Rewarming of the skin.
