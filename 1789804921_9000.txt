[5:20:54] prideofkarma_: have you been doing the chaos orb recipe at all?
[5:21:18] prideofkarma_: you sell 1 of each piece of rare gear and you get chaos orbs
[5:21:23] prideofkarma_: unid
[5:21:24] celled_: chaos recipy is too tedious dont bother LUL
[5:21:36] Hambubger86: Chaos orb recipe isn't really worth it unless you're really fast at it
[5:21:56] Hambubger86: Chaos recipe is a generally a bait
[5:21:59] DunzoCD: its only really good if you are running heists, otherwise you will never have enough amulets/rings
[5:22:03] prideofkarma_: yeah but i guess your almost to red maps so it doesnt really matter
[5:22:29] celled_: another boss like maven
[5:22:59] Hambubger86: The vast majority of the time blasting maps is way more profitable than chaos recipe
[5:23:15] DunzoCD: if you are running it blue just use an alteration
[5:23:16] prideofkarma_: use an alt orb i think
[5:23:20] prideofkarma_: idk i usually scour and alch my maps
[5:23:21] shale93: orbs of alteration or whatever its called
[5:23:27] DunzoCD: or scour/alc
[5:23:28] TheItalianStallion321: does the PoE trade website keep going down for people saying bad gateway? its fuckin annoying as shit
[5:23:38] celled_: to gain atlas passive point you want to run map rare and corrupted
[5:23:57] shale93: I think you should be doing rare maps though
[5:24:04] Hambubger86: @towelliee if you can afford to do it you should use an alch orb on every map. You'll always make back the alch.

[5:24:22] LuiBMHunter: shoulda played paladin then you'd have your own bubble :)
[5:24:25] DunzoCD: if you are in yellow maps you have to run it yellow for atlas completion, then in red maps you have to run it rare and corrupted

[5:25:44] Hambubger86: Just FYI @towelliee when you get to yellow maps you only get completion for them if you use an alch orb on them to make them rare first. And red maps you need to use an alch orb as well as a vaal orb
[5:27:08] Hambubger86: Yes
[5:27:10] prideofkarma_: to get the atlas point
[5:27:13] celled_: for altas point
[5:27:14] prideofkarma_: yeah they have to be rare maps
[5:27:28] Hambubger86: To get credit for completion
[5:27:37] prideofkarma_: correct
[5:27:38] Hambubger86: Yes
[5:27:41] Shrenko: yes
[5:27:44] celled_: need to be rare and corrupted
[5:27:49] DunzoCD: 11 has to be rare and corrupted
[5:28:23] Hambubger86: To be honest it's always worth to alch every map you do as you always will get enough back to cover the alch you used
[5:29:59] Hambubger86: You're learning that's all that matters really
[5:30:58] 91Niki: Yeah so maps are all about run as many as possible as fast as possible. Opening chests slow you down. That's why you aren't actually supposed to open chests unless they are in your path

[5:32:36] Shrenko: yeah
[5:32:42] Liquid_vsop: you can
[5:32:42] prideofkarma_: use a orb of horizon on your maps to try to get a map that you havent completed
[5:32:59] Shrenko: need to complete atlas goals to get higher tier maps, atleast last time I played :P
[5:33:05] G1vanov: You trade 3 of the same map

[5:48:53] Nevindaz: usually when I see this cheap offers I just pay it double
[5:49:01] prideofkarma_: how low can you go on res for an immortal flesh? i just dropped one with -21% and 326 regen
[5:49:03] 91Niki: If I put something up too low and someone with a Korean name buys it, they ALWAYS pay what it is actually worth
[5:49:07] celled_: experienced ppl just use addons for trading that can show price with 1button
[5:49:39] PvtHudson093: Spooders rooScream

[6:04:59] prideofkarma_: or maybe look for th actual app after you run the installer
[6:05:06] ContraRob: hit the windows key and then type awakened, and launch the app
[6:05:07] 91Niki: and the curseforge one gets updated constantly
[6:05:09] ContraRob: then launch PoE
[6:05:11] Xanctius: @91Niki and it takes a ton more ressources and overwolf has a ton of backend stuff you dont want
[6:05:11] TheGiant99: @Towelliee whats good my friend
[6:05:23] headshot_hunter6: run that?#
[6:05:23] Meowzer: use the EXE
[6:05:37] Hambubger86: try running as admin
[6:05:42] 91Niki: @Xanctius Overwolf 2016 maybe :p Current one isn't as bad. Plus you can literally set it to exit when you close poe trade

[6:06:43] 91Niki: And people are saying the overwolf one is bad KEKW
[6:06:48] Exxcar: If you need admin to install a normal program, that's not normal
[6:06:56] celled_: maybe you need to game capture
[6:07:06] Hambubger86: I have never had a single issue with awakened poe trade slowing down my PC lol
[6:07:21] Skitso777: same
[6:07:25] kokochris: @Exxcar as a security researcher who deals with Malware; I'm freaking out
[6:07:26] celled_: you are dualpc ?
[6:07:29] Hambubger86: ah
[6:07:33] celled_: oh
[6:07:50] prideofkarma_: its kind of busted right now because the trade site is busted
[6:07:52] Exxcar: @kokochris As someone who worked as OPS for a big tech for 7 years, I am too
[6:08:03] sponx: Shift+Space, you might need to set league
[6:08:03] Hambubger86: make sure the right league is selected in the program
[6:08:05] 91Niki: @Xanctius I mean if you wanna stay in that ignorant boat. Good for you SeemsGood That's a 2016 mentality tho
[6:08:20] Meowzer: hover online
[6:08:21] kokochris: @Exxcar danS
[6:08:21] Hambubger86: hit shift + space to bring up options
[6:08:22] sponx: Shift+Space
[6:08:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: the top
[6:08:26] Meowzer: select crucibal
[6:08:31] prideofkarma_: close that and press shift and space
[6:08:38] prideofkarma_: oh there you go
[6:08:41] prideofkarma_: perfect
[6:08:50] prideofkarma_: thats the price of that item
[6:08:54] Hambubger86: there you go, it has prices below
[6:09:12] Sollice: Oh what do you know. Alt F4 on a user does a time out
[6:09:31] prideofkarma_: weird that it lags for you
[6:09:53] prideofkarma_: does it do that on your game pc or is that just obs doing that?

[6:10:14] 91Niki: Yeah might be OBS not liking that it's an overlay
[6:10:16] prideofkarma_: ahh gotcha
[6:10:30] ThaOriginalGamester: yea, might be a bandwidth thing
[6:10:36] Hambubger86: Yeah that's how it works
[6:10:55] Hambubger86: it scrapes the trade API
[6:10:58] Exxcar: If it is using enough netork to tap a gigabyte network... something is horribly wrong
[6:11:14] kokochris: @Exxcar exactly...

[6:14:21] 91Niki: You gotta put them in a right order to get the most out of it
[6:14:22] Hambubger86: The poles with the skulls, they spawn big mobs
[6:14:29] prideofkarma_: you want the big skulls and chests
[6:14:32] 91Niki: and make sure you get a lot of mobs in the circles as well
[6:14:46] Hambubger86: Basically you blow up the boxes for modifiers, and you want to spawn as many of the big skulls and chests as possible

[6:22:52] 91Niki: they have a chance to drop higher
[6:23:05] Hambubger86: Just have to run maps until they drop, or hope Kirac sells some. That's why the nodes that give a chance to make your maps higher tier are good.

[6:23:06] Kheonik: Kirac might sell too
[6:23:21] 2MomsHoldingDeez: how expensive are lvl 10 maps?
[6:23:42] 91Niki: It's basically just a grind to run maps, hoping they will drop higher maps. Unless you wanna buy maps from players
[6:23:44] Xanctius: @Towelliee Try searching for "Shaping the seas" in your atlas tree, the nodes in that area of the tree helps getting higher maps
[6:24:02] JiveDude: Sell 3 lower maps for 1 tier higher map
[6:24:06] Kheonik: he does sell higher maps too, he was selling like 2 tiers higher maps for me when I was still in white maps

[6:24:52] Xanctius: center of the tree
[6:25:01] DunzoCD: getting both those is helpful at league start
[6:25:29] Xanctius: those nodes gives your maps a higher chance to drop as higher tier
[6:27:30] DunzoCD: have you not set up you map device in your hideout? or do you just like running them from karui shores?
[6:28:10] Gunch73: ten hits
[6:28:54] Hambubger86: Yeah, and RF is just not a great build for blight in general TBH
[6:29:03] G1vanov: It's your build. I have more gear and I still struggle on some blights
[6:29:19] Mostdangspy: also certain builds are way better at blight. there are some minion builds where you need to do nothing and can beat the full blight maps
[6:29:42] Xanctius: everyone was a valley girl
[6:29:46] Hebrewish012: yeah

[6:30:40] Hambubger86: Yeah, different builds are better at different league mechanics. RF is not very good at blight
[6:30:43] Ziephier: Ziephier subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[6:30:52] Xanctius: cast on death + portal :)
[6:31:03] G1vanov: RF is fine when you get Pohx level of gear LUL
[6:31:20] G1vanov: or the explode version
[6:31:22] Justica_0: Do you have a map device set up in your hideout?

[6:32:02] Hambubger86: and breacgh
[6:32:02] ShadowDMG6969: Retros
[6:32:10] neverbornlucky: you wear sketchers dog
[6:32:10] ShadowDMG6969: 100% teh retros
[6:32:37] Hambubger86: RF just kinda sucks at legion and blight
[6:33:23] Gunch73: its fine for blight you need to do towers like three cluster towers go seismic closest too portal then empower then flame
[6:33:40] Smoknjoe24: yes it's chaos damage
[6:33:40] Justica_0: That’s toxic rain
[6:33:40] Hebrewish012: pretty much

[6:37:26] Smoknjoe24: the damage you gain from unyielding is minor
[6:37:48] Smoknjoe24: So no stun no freeze
[6:37:57] neverbornlucky: my wife says what is in my pants is unstoppable
[6:38:03] Smoknjoe24: and you never go below 100% movespeed
[6:38:25] G1vanov: you can check his update vids
[6:38:31] Smoknjoe24: @neverbornlucky Yeah things that never get started are unstoppable LUL
[6:38:31] G1vanov: he has a couple
[6:38:32] MrYoke: unbreakable is too powerful for general tankyness. Chaos damage can be midigated with resistance
[6:38:56] Hambubger86: It's also possible he is getting freeze/stun immune from other sources in his build, like on his gear
[6:38:58] Xanctius: Pohx hits level 100 with it every league, sometimes multiple times a league LUL
[6:39:08] 91Niki: @neverbornlucky I mean, unstoppable to what expectations ? Kappa
[6:39:19] Smoknjoe24: For heist you can sell all but the quest heists
[6:39:58] G1vanov: your main problem is not having Uber lab and running two ES/Evasion pieces
[6:40:11] neverbornlucky: she calls it her red armored guy from xmen juggar something that is unstoppable

[6:47:49] Hambubger86: Ignores your phys resistance
[6:47:57] Nokterian: omg
[6:47:59] Shrenko: WAYTOODANK
[6:48:01] Smoknjoe24: Overwhelms phys reduction
[6:48:10] Smoknjoe24: it's like phys penetration
[6:48:11] Nokterian: 400 mobs
[6:48:17] Nokterian: naguuraMonkaS
[6:48:54] MrYoke: Each logbook can sell for 30c+
[6:49:00] Skkold: As a new PoE player, I have no idea what's going on, and I'm sure I never will lol
[6:49:00] prideofkarma_: yeah there were log books last season going for 120c
[6:49:08] Crystalyzee: it really is nothing to ppl who play
[6:49:10] Hambubger86: A logbook is a special map specifically for expedition. Can get you a shit load of currency, or sell for 30+c as well
[6:49:10] JiveDude: Thats still cheap. Divine's is were the butter is
[6:49:14] Mostdangspy: logbooks are a map that is a giant expedition
[6:49:31] Smoknjoe24: Well once you get Exarh and Eater rolling you can make 60-90c every 28 maps
[6:49:35] Hebrewish012: so save log books
[6:49:37] Hebrewish012: got it
[6:49:44] Hambubger86: I run my logbooks because they are fun and you can hit big on them, but a lot of people just sell them
[6:49:47] MrYoke: Logbooks are like expedition maps and running them can also be very lucrative.
[6:49:56] prideofkarma_: you can also gamble at tujen for raw divine orbs
[6:50:21] Xanctius: Same with Grimro and bow builds
[6:50:27] abidetx: all it takes is one lucky drop
[6:50:32] Crystalyzee: as a new player you get baited into picking up every item and portaling like 4-6 times a map vendoring shit good players skip most that loot and only pick good bases and spam more maps

[6:52:04] cynical_effect12: Your in your display mode
[6:52:05] Crystalyzee: well he also spams his pots and spamming shield charge everywhere
[6:52:19] Hambubger86: You have to think of farming like pulling on a slot machine hoping for the jackpot. The vast majority of items that drop are worthless, so its ok to ignore a lot of stuff for more chances to pull the slot machine lever.
[6:52:58] abidetx: you can change transparency of the map if its hard to see
[6:53:07] Crystalyzee: gain charges when hit is a must with your build
[6:53:08] Shrenko: potions is really important, try to keep uptime on those buffs all the time
[6:53:31] Shrenko: like use your potions towelliee !
[6:54:25] Entropist7: bis potion is bottled faith and right now its probably like 30-50 divs
[6:55:03] neverbornlucky: it has a good cast
[6:55:13] JiveDude: use instilling orbs to get triggered potions
[6:55:22] bloodogg35: Ziz made a new char last night and during 12 hour stream  he did he got the char to level 73

[6:56:42] bloodogg35: Exiles hc char got pked yesterday
[6:56:51] raldrik: rounders
[6:57:18] bloodogg35: He was rank 2 for hc
[6:58:11] Hambubger86: It was a bug with a new item
[6:58:42] neverbornlucky: I can't believe the Kang actor in major movie screwed up so bad
[6:58:48] neverbornlucky: he was set for life
[6:58:50] Xanctius: Ben dies to lag, ImExile dies to bugs
[6:58:53] Hambubger86: Basically a new item killed him due to an interaction it wasn't supposed to have
[6:59:02] sponx: There's a new belt which kills your linked target if you die, so someone asked for help killing a boss, used a link spell and killed him.
[6:59:04] Entropist7: usually they die by not reading some mod on a map and go 100-0 health in 0.001 second
[7:00:05] sponx: Yep
[7:00:10] bloodogg35: Yup
[7:00:36] Hambubger86: Yeah the PoE devs don't really care
[7:00:55] Wulfgrym: witch
[7:00:57] Xanctius: Witch
[7:01:01] Krushok_TV: witch
[7:01:03] Hambubger86: I remember back in the day when people would complain about getting scammed the devs would be like "it's a tough world out there" LUL
[7:01:04] TheGiant99: witch
[7:01:04] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[7:01:04] LspN: witch
[7:01:10] Entropist7: devs will only react if you praise le toucan
[7:01:17] Xanctius: Witch is the necro ascendancy
[7:01:17] Wulfgrym: anyone can do minions, but witch becomes a necro
[7:01:38] LspN: LspN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[7:01:39] neverbornlucky: Towelliee, go witch - frost nova, teleport, spirit of rage, zombies, and skeletons
[7:01:54] kingdaddy96: That's my current build attempt
[7:01:55] Wulfgrym: most likely a necro, but you can build a minion build for any class
[7:02:15] Hambubger86: The PoE devs treat it kind of like how Eve does. Scamming and weird interactions are a part of life. If you play HC tough shit life goes on.
[7:02:28] headshot_hunter6: ghazzy is the king of minions
[7:02:35] Smoknjoe24: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[7:02:45] Gunch73: towellie playing it now seems good
[7:03:11] Smoknjoe24: Seriously Watch Ghazzy's Minion tier list before creating ANY minion build. you'll save a lot of headaches @Towelliee
[7:03:17] Wulfgrym: yeah sounds like eve to me LUL
[7:03:18] Xanctius: Thats not really true, they did disable the belt after it happened, and I am sure they reached out to ImExile in private, they are good at that stuff
[7:03:28] Wulfgrym: then witch

[7:03:42] Wulfgrym: masks FTW
[7:03:46] Smoknjoe24: Necro in D4 is worse
[7:04:05] neverbornlucky: Towelliee you watch your mouth and name the witch junifer
[7:04:14] Hambubger86: @Xanctius in recent times they have softened a bit, yes. But there are so few instances of them restoring characters for people. They are the exceptions not the rule.
[7:04:17] Syllvn: @Smoknjoe24 what?
[7:04:18] Sir_Cranium: Roberta
[7:04:27] JiveDude: oh you starting witch

[7:05:22] lildraggonlady: HeyGuys
[7:05:25] Xanctius: @Hambubger86 yeah, ofcourse, I didnt say they would restore his character, but saying they dont care isnt true either
[7:05:25] Smoknjoe24: The necro in D4 looks like complete and utter crap
[7:05:27] Sir_Cranium: That’s the witch from pirates
