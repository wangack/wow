[2:03:23] Funderik: i disagree, if it's not the BEST alt friendly expansion doesn't mean it's a failure.
[2:03:55] Dasbesta: Wow expansions always come in 3. Had the OG vanilla, BC WOTLK, then the second Cata, Mists, WOD, which redid all the systems. Now it's third phase. Legion, BFA, SL, which did all the newer things that people are not really liking, all the borrowed popwer etc.
[2:04:10] barakiss123: i like that wayyyy better , i don’t want to be forced to do à million things with the little time i will have but it will be nice to have things to do for fun whenever i’m bored

[7:06:18] Nazreim: are the rumors true that he borrowed money from viewers and never püayed it back?
[7:06:19] thiccsushi: He should be banned off twitch the guy scammed viewers and streamers LUL

[7:08:02] melo_relo443: They won’t ban because twitch supports gambling cause it makes them money
[7:08:07] Zerevorr: borderline case to the good old problem of mental illness and personal responsiblity
[7:08:08] freetherocktv: @Towelliee but he did talk like an addict that need serious help instead of someone who is realizing he fucked up. The first step is admitting you have a problem so at least he is doing that

[7:09:07] DaltonIRL: @freetherocktv thats not even true. While Hasan was explaining to him what he should do to progress further hes making jokes about hasans voice and his ADHD not listening
[7:09:10] mavericks312: is that why there was this big thing on twitter to ban gambling on twitch now?
[7:09:12] Timothious: some jail time would probably help him realize he has a problem

[7:09:24] freetherocktv: @Towelliee Mizkif is calling big streamers to not show up to twitchcon and to also not stream for a week to make twitch ban gambling
[7:09:27] MedicinalGamer: Scammmin too strong to ban

[7:09:50] Sollice: So how does his offline personal gambling problems have to do with Twitch
[7:10:01] LandoLife: !beta
[7:10:06] AlvZav: I like turtles
[7:10:10] melo_relo443: Yeah but twitch is gonna try to find a loop hole to not ban and make a big deal out of it because he didn’t message people on twitch he did it on discord, but he used his viewers and streamers from twitch if twitch were to ban him it would look back on them because the whole gambling aspect
[7:10:12] Ezekyler: Durids op  peepoHappy
[7:10:15] L4nds1ide: trainwreck is a legend
[7:10:18] freetherocktv: @Towelliee the ones doing meet and greets
[7:10:28] Alaquane: wasn' that the whole phantomlord thing? csgo something? or is this a new scam?
[7:10:29] DaltonIRL: I think Asmon would happily take time off lmao
[7:10:38] Lenietwitch: @love_eggplant well then ban alcohol as well, is more dangerous
[7:10:47] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee now you get to say this is the reason you aren't going, instant social clout
[7:10:51] melo_relo443: ASMON would def not go to boycott the gambling stuff
[7:10:56] love_eggplant: @leniewashere im talking about on the twitch platform ?
[7:11:02] Zerevorr: @love_eggplant whatabutism
[7:11:09] ensoar: are you going to fully cap or just farm the full brutal set?
[7:11:12] kamisengames: @love_eggplant Thought open drinking was already banned
[7:11:18] AlvZav: Ban gaming xo it’s ruins lives
[7:11:21] freetherocktv: @Towelliee they are brainstorming ideas to get twitchs attention
[7:11:24] mavericks312: OTK has sponsor reasont to be a twitchcon highly doubt the dont go
[7:11:25] backstreetalright: I feel for the guy but idk if gambling is the direct issue you know maybe mental health is the problem
[7:11:28] Optimus_Servo: im sure people would find a Pachinko style loophole and still do it
[7:11:30] PhillyDilly18: Chat, this is the diablo2 soundtrack playing right?
[7:11:37] MedicinalGamer: Meet n greet = charging for meeting like a hooker
[7:11:38] VolkhvGaming: @melo_relo443 he was literally calling for a boycott his last hour of his last stream lmao
[7:11:45] love_eggplant: in my country public drinking is banned yes
[7:11:45] EdgyKoala: are youserioua, I turned teacher . No gambling or you get hit
[7:11:48] love_eggplant: u cant drink on the streets

[7:12:01] Sollice: @melo_relo443 That's not a good enough reason. He could have been a huge redditor and had people following his posts and gotten people from there to do it
[7:12:03] bartogo1988: How does the classic wotlk works, itll be separate from classic wow and so on and itll stay just lich king forever ?

[7:12:22] melo_relo443: I think I agree with banning gambling on twitch to many kids watch it
[7:12:37] mavericks312: specifically they want slots banned due to all the rng

[7:12:41] TheItalianStallion321: i honestly believe Twitch has no concrete rules, they make them up as they go along. i know some rules are set but some seem not set
[7:12:41] Alaquane: genshin impact
[7:12:42] kamisengames: Too many Games are filled with gambling now too with lootboxes
[7:12:50] Celira: plenty of gambling that happens in games that skirts the typical definition SO closely
[7:12:50] melo_relo443: Ban slots and sponsored streams that pay streamers to gamble live
[7:12:51] backstreetalright: Its hurtfull for me cuz i love gambling so much you just have to have control you know like everything in life
[7:12:54] Leafeon022: Giveaways are a form of gambling? so are point bettings lol
[7:12:59] Savagedenny: I mean when you /roll for gold in wow isn't that gambling
[7:13:15] freetherocktv: @Towelliee ya that is very true where do we start?
[7:13:17] Recording_on_the_grass: bank drinking next...
[7:13:17] mrrazputin: Giveaway of DF beta is a gambling :D
[7:13:18] MedicinalGamer: Loot boxes =  gambling
[7:13:18] AlvZav: I like mangos
[7:13:18] Ophirin: Banning slots would probably be a good start
[7:13:19] Warspick187: Yea but if your spending money to get in game currency where you gamble for items is that Gambling though?
[7:13:21] Densetsu_: Banning stuff is not the way to go imo. Exactly, the line, ban games, that has loot boxes? Ban alchohol? Because that can be bad for you and so on.
[7:13:21] Recording_on_the_grass: ban even
[7:13:28] neverbornlucky: bye bye marvel strike force
[7:13:33] EdgyKoala: Oh yeah we are Chinese .gamble for your moon cake
[7:13:36] Shirey36: arnt death rolls banned in eu?
[7:13:36] love_eggplant: i think banning online casinos is a very good start and end
[7:13:40] melo_relo443: I think the wow rolling is way different from slots
[7:13:41] EdgyKoala: truth
[7:13:44] Mecabeast: blizz was not happy about death rolls lol
[7:13:45] Sollice: @mrrazputin It's not gambling. You put nothing towards it and you lost nothing because you didnt win
[7:13:47] spookychefkarolina: Loopholes allow a lot of things to remain in place that just shouldn’t.
[7:13:47] freetherocktv: @Towelliee how do you think we can make things better without screwing over people?
[7:14:01] love_eggplant: money grab in games is unavoidable
[7:14:07] Warspick187: Yep, whats the difference
[7:14:09] spookychefkarolina: @sollice or lose technically.
[7:14:09] dozedr: @Towelliee it's not about banning gambling, it's about banning gambling sponsors and/or ads that glorify or promote it
[7:14:10] love_eggplant: but you can ban casinos easily
[7:14:22] delaine: Every second tv commercial in Ontario is for sports betting now
[7:14:23] vimie: money has real world implications (housing, food, etc)
[7:14:26] Zerevorr: Can you stop the whataboutism, just because they are other bad  dynamics doesnt mean whe shouldnt ban them
[7:14:27] kamisengames: Stop being so sensitive and trying to ban everything IMO, take more personal responsibility
[7:14:30] scumlucki: sup @towelliee
[7:14:35] melo_relo443: I get what your saying but I think casino type of gambling is way different from playing a video game
[7:14:38] Celira: pretty much has been since games became a service, not a product - gamers have nobody to blame but themselves for letting it get to this point
[7:14:42] EdgyKoala: when it feels like a gift for winning I think okay
[7:14:47] mrrazputin: @mrrazputin Gambling is conected to chances not defined by posibility of loosing or wining anything
[7:14:54] szble: fifa packs lol
[7:15:00] neverbornlucky: ban cs go gambling
[7:15:01] mavericks312: personally ban anytype of casino gambling
[7:15:02] love_eggplant: @kamisengames do you not understand how easily people are influenced by people they idolize?
[7:15:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: plinko basically
[7:15:03] EdgyKoala: but if you feel like,you lose money that is wrong
[7:15:04] DaltonIRL: @kamisengames the problem is a lot of these people aren't even 18 years old so saying "take responsibility" doesn't exactly make sense.
[7:15:21] Medobolt: i hope they ban genshin KEKW
[7:15:23] Sollice: @mrrazputin No...thats called odds. I am pretty sure gambling requires a personal stake to be considered gambling
[7:15:23] melo_relo443: Yeah twitch would have to really evaluate stuff
[7:15:30] Ramoneko: i do it once, when kid...my dad see, never more....thsi is my life education hahah
[7:15:32] kamisengames: Yes it does, Parents are responsible for thier children
[7:15:33] backstreetalright: if you guys wanna go down the line isnt financial investment gambling in a certain way?
[7:15:39] TotallyNotRaien: those are bad too
[7:15:39] mrrazputin: @mrrazputin are you from US ?
[7:15:53] Zerevorr: Gambling is a alogorythm bases dopamin scam machine, modern games also have this patterns and its an issue.
[7:15:54] reggiepowa: but for real it should be regulated
[7:15:59] Zerevorr: we need to differentiate
[7:16:02] DaltonIRL: at the end of the day if people weren't losing money XqC and Train wouldn't have a sponsorship no matter how many times they give half ass disclaimers
[7:16:02] melo_relo443: Me personally and this goes back to when they started supply drops back in cod advanced warfare they should have never allowed that
[7:16:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: when you spend money on a gacha like genshin you know the money is gone no matter what, when its real money you expect to make your money back plus more
[7:16:13] Mecabeast: got my beta when I got off work friday
[7:16:20] 30deeds: hows the AV games Towelliee
[7:16:21] Densetsu_: I mean, parents should take more responsibilities on what ur kids are doing on the web.
[7:16:26] freetherocktv: @kamisengames and the problem nowadays the parents are paying any attention to their online behavior because they want to be "friends" with their kids instead of being a parent and provide disipline
[7:16:28] scumlucki: Need an active sub for the beta opt in NotLikeThis
[7:16:29] SilverLynx87: @reggiepowa it is regulated already. You have to be in a state that allows online gamlbing to start
[7:16:38] EdgyKoala: I got no proble. With regult
[7:16:39] freetherocktv: @kamisengames aren't
[7:16:40] Timothious: You can gamble in the market but if you invest in good companies and leave it there it will grow
[7:16:48] mavericks312: @HaxzorJimDuggan yea exactly gacha games you know when you spend the money your no getting any of it back and you know exactly what your getting
[7:16:48] scumlucki: 2k is so danm greedy
[7:16:48] kingkafro: most mobile gamess for starters
[7:16:54] szble: ea makes bank of packs
[7:17:01] kamisengames: @freetherocktv And Why should my freedoms be infringed because thier parents are lazy?
[7:17:10] EdgyKoala: Asians love to g
[7:17:10] Zerevorr: We regulate one thing, then we will see about the other things, no reason to immediately regulate everything because people are stupid screaming "but what abouut XYXX"
[7:17:14] love_eggplant: just because there are hidden scams in games doesnt mean you cant restrict casino
[7:17:17] phantom0803: would be the same thing for buying gems for skins in mobas

[7:17:25] elchapoclencho: @Towelliee have you been lvling through AV?
[7:17:25] sircheex: what about just banning sponsored gambling streams?
[7:17:27] DaltonIRL: @kamisengames removing content from a platform is hardly infringing on your freedom lmao
[7:17:30] goosejamss: EU has banned loot boxes already, but FIFA packs still reign supreme
[7:17:38] spookychefkarolina: @daltonirl if you were irresponsible enough to let your kid get their hands on your wallet….. that’s not really the con artists problem. I was given an allowance on a gift card, if I spent it - that was on me. But my parents never gave me their card and said “have at it!”
[7:17:41] Celira: and thats pretty much what many countries in EU have done - so clearly, its possible
[7:17:43] freetherocktv: @kamisengames what kind of take is that? go drive a car you have to go through a lot of stuff to legally drive a car because of idiots and irresponsible people
[7:17:45] phantom0803: plausible deniability
[7:17:54] Storm0118: i think the difference is you can't gain monetary value outside the game from putting money in
[7:18:00] Shirey36: you dont want twitch making rules on that....its up to the parent to keep their kids from watching content they dont want them to be watching

[7:18:04] Densetsu_: @fractaleyes "EU" - define "EU". Not all European countries have banned loot boxes.
[7:18:07] Warspick187: Twitch doesnt need to Ban just make it iilegal for games to gamble on Boxes.... You Pay for what you want DONE
[7:18:14] piratechris: Well games with loot boxes or similar mechanics are becoming illegal all over Europe. I think games relying on that will have to change how they do business or forget the entire EU market in the future.
[7:18:15] celestiea98: !beta keys
[7:18:18] Lenietwitch: and thats should be enough
[7:18:21] Mecabeast: what's the min age in twitches tos like 16?
[7:18:23] Zerevorr: Things like csgo boxes or fifa things will also get banned, there is just awarness raising over the last few years. This is a kinda new developement resulting from proffesionalisation of gaming industry and gathered knowledge in psychology
[7:18:24] deedeemegadoodooo: morning Towelliee
[7:18:39] kolteezmo: what pally spec you rockin?
[7:18:45] ArcaneSyntax: yeah twitch can't be the parent to every child that watches the site.
[7:18:45] Zerevorr: professionalisation*
[7:18:46] freetherocktv: @Towelliee aren't loot boxes banned in Europe?
[7:18:58] phantom0803: But it is also at twitch's discretion as well. they could ban what they want for what they want without a complete line
[7:19:02] EdgyKoala: if warmed it fine. Also your wife needsto say
[7:19:07] Medobolt: @freetherocktv not all of europe
[7:19:08] hugosilva: morning
[7:19:10] jkitchin75: @freetherocktv not all of europe
[7:19:11] melo_relo443: It’s wild that twitch, YouTube, etc allow it because of all the places gambling is illegal and it’s not just streaming/video platforms it’s games to
[7:19:19] Warspick187: Just take the Gamble out of it and slightly increase prices but you know what your getting
[7:19:19] goosejamss: @Densetsu_ it's 18 countries trying to ban loot boxes, 2 already have (Belgium, Netherlands)
[7:19:20] kolteezmo: how do you feel about preg paladin?
[7:19:27] Sollice: If your in the US, gambling is not going anywhere. It's becoming more common. MOre states are allowing online spots bets and opening legal gambling
[7:19:36] SilverLynx87: I think using children on the site as a reason for a gambling ban is a stretch, most of these people are over 18 and making bad decisions and want to blame content creators
[7:19:50] piratechris: Yeah it's only a matter of time before Loot Boxes become illegal all over europe.
[7:19:57] SilverLynx87: The dude that scammed money was a grown man

[7:20:27] Sollice: @freetherocktv I agree with you on that. Mental Health in this country is severly underfunded
[7:20:29] melo_relo443: And that’s why twitch won’t ban it because of the sponsors

[7:20:37] love_eggplant: please also think about those streamers that normalize gambling
[7:20:43] love_eggplant: gambling is a serious issue and addiction like alcohol
[7:20:47] sifer007: man blizzard milked this game real good
[7:20:59] love_eggplant: normalizing drinking every weekend & gambling is very bad
[7:21:00] Warspick187: Yea but Technically you need to be 18 to gamble, 16/17 year olds have jobs and can online gamble boxes, whats the Diff?
[7:21:03] melo_relo443: Any addiction is serious @love_eggplant
[7:21:03] SilverLynx87: @love_eggplant they don't normalize gambling, I watch them. They advocate against it constantly
[7:21:11] love_eggplant: yeah because they are forced to
[7:21:18] SilverLynx87: They tell people it's risky all the time
[7:21:36] kappaday23: Kappa
[7:21:41] Zerevorr: Doing something stupid while telling people its stupid doesnt help reduce the amount of rolemodeling lol
[7:21:45] spookychefkarolina: @sollice @freetherocktv mental health is also a huge factor in gambling in particular. Much like substance abuse. But no one wants to talk about it.
[7:21:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: since when do people listen to people telling them its risky
[7:21:50] Medobolt: @Towelliee have you tried ret? im having a blast with it
[7:21:51] Sathalan: so is video games addition. so let's just had video games off twitch too @love_eggplant  monnGRUMP
[7:21:59] Sathalan: addiction*
[7:22:05] melo_relo443: I think a lot of the problem has to do with the sponsored streams and these streamers that do live gambling are winning because the stuff is rigged to win plus it’s not their money they’re playing with it’s the sponsored. It’s gives a false nerrative
[7:22:07] freetherocktv: @Sollice I have heard that gambling addiction is worse than drug addiction because you can't do much against your own high if that make sense
[7:22:08] SilverLynx87: @HaxzorJimDuggan then that's their problem??? idk what to tell you people LUL
[7:22:11] love_eggplant: @Sathalan video games addiction doesn't make people homeless

[7:22:17] Celira: "this is risky", but watch me win, and get the idea that you'll win big too!
[7:22:26] Itmyfault69: I think this whole thing is kinda a watershed  moment where we see the real danger to promoting gambling on twitch. Doubt any streamer will help someone out who is a gambler anymore. I dont even get the appeal of watching someone gamble on twitch
[7:22:29] mavericks312: 2 easy fixs twitch can make is ban casino gambling streams and sponsored gambling streams
[7:22:33] Sathalan: @love_eggplant it might for all you know
[7:22:40] SilverLynx87: If you watch someone gambling millions and think you're gonna win too you're really really dense
[7:22:46] melo_relo443: The only reason streamers say it’s risky is to cover their asses
[7:23:00] spookychefkarolina: Gambling commercials should be banned as were tobacco commercials. Every time I see a draft kings I cringe.
[7:23:01] melo_relo443: I agree
[7:23:10] Zerevorr: @Silverlynx87 Thing is this happens for a fact, so what?
[7:23:15] Anzel_1: @freetherocktv Gambling addiction isn't worse than drug addiction its just different.

[7:23:38] spookychefkarolina: @imanzel not in the mental health sense. They correlate quite a lot. Google it.
[7:23:47] elchapoclencho: saw amouranth and stpeach had a collab stream the other day, how the FCK is soft p0rn allowed on twitch while other shit gets banned instantly
[7:23:52] EdgyKoala: If gamble is is it wont
[7:23:54] MayroVision: Lifes a gamble, it’s all about the poker chips…
[7:23:55] Frosilen: Good Morning mates! ❤️
[7:24:06] Warspick187: Yea but who does that though?
[7:24:21] Anzel_1: @spookychefkarolina I've done a paper on it, I know the correlation exists but its different because of what it takes away and how it effects those around you.
[7:24:23] Zomgboy: @elchapoclencho twitch makes money so dont give a fk
[7:24:30] EdgyKoala: pachinko I can
[7:24:30] melo_relo443: I think the videos are good to but the vids only show a win not a loss which is dangerous and they give the streamers or content creators a higher chance to win plus it’s the sponsores money

[7:25:46] TheItalianStallion321: SO MANY GOOD GAMES yesterday. The Jets game, Dolphins. Cardinals
[7:25:46] spookychefkarolina: @imanzel it depends on the subject as well. Substances take a little longer to ruin ones life whereas you can gamble your car away in a minute depending on where you’re gambling.
[7:25:50] Medobolt: 3900? KEKW
[7:25:51] SilverLynx87: @melo_relo443 it is his money, you're wrong
[7:25:51] Tighron: science says yes, all social media is affecting youth mostly negatively.

[7:26:00] mayonaes: My bucs finally figured out how to beat the saints

[7:26:12] TheItalianStallion321: the Jets lost 13 straight September games. until yesterday
[7:26:18] maacckk_: Lost my starting QB Trey Lance Sadge
[7:26:29] Anzel_1: @spookychefkarolina Yeah I'll agree with you there, depending on how bad off you are or how your body reacts to the drugs you could sell quick but I digress. both addictions are a huge negative to society.
[7:26:36] NewWorldReign: how about that brawl with tom bradys tream?

[7:31:31] freetherocktv: @Towelliee do you think anything will ever be done about react content? I have nothing against it I am just curious on people restreaming content and getting paid when they do nothing themselves
[7:31:34] spookychefkarolina: @theitalianstallion321 what’s “weird” to most of today’s society though? I remember when Facebook stalking was “weird” and yet everyone does it now. It’s all about acclimation unfortunately.

[7:33:02] Zerevorr: Content that is based on others people content. There should be taxes
[7:33:04] freetherocktv: @Towelliee I mean the people that would take your VOD and upload it to youtube as if they were doing something, that happens a lot
[7:33:12] Yagr6: im going to go outside now
[7:33:16] melo_relo443: Yeah react content can be toxic I only watch one person when it comes to that stuff which is asmongold and he speaks facts
[7:33:24] warrenny: React content is low effort
[7:33:32] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: All the Druid trees are fucked IMHO
[7:33:41] spookychefkarolina: @freetherocktv people like watching people react. As rudimentary as it sounds. It’s like when you show your friend your favorite movie and you want to see them get excited at a certain part. It’s likely never going to become unpopular. Unless like Towel says, it becomes toxic.
