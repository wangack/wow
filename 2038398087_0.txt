[0:09:06] Elrathir: it looked very green to me
[0:09:24] Zuldak: The last mog you need is always the worst
[0:09:25] Elrathir: I seeee...
[0:09:29] amaya21: you half- forgot :P
[0:09:36] Cainnar: Cainnar watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 3 is good too
[0:09:37] Thoragh_: Regarding LotR wizards in my mind I always imagined a few like Gandalf gatekeeping the magic to keep it from those that may not handle it correctly (see his 'buddy' Saruman)
[0:09:53] 2manydjs: whats the addon you use to track your mount runs?
[0:09:55] bitshady: is there no limit on the big diggs?

[0:13:49] Zuldak: waycrest
[0:14:08] mrsrockguru: afternon @HazelNuttyGames and chat
[0:14:10] Hanolas: How do you feel about the 8 week patch cycle? I feel like it's too much for completionists (like me).
[0:14:25] mrsrockguru: mrsrockguru watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! weeee
[0:14:26] witchhobbit: i'm just noticing that at least with certain staffs you can still see your weapon on your back while using the new kaldorei bedrolls!
[0:14:30] Zuldak: a wailing caverns key would slap... how many people would miss that small jump and fall?
[0:14:36] beezelebaub: me when I get to stream within 15 mins of it starting PrideLionYay
[0:14:56] WhippWhapp: o/ Happy Saturday!
[0:14:59] witchhobbit: without bad clipping i should add
[0:15:20] Elrathir: @Zuldak at least one, as evidenced by Hazel just missing the small gap between those buildings :P
[0:15:25] amaya21: it's because they are so cute
[0:15:30] jeffdmk: do you even like camping?
[0:15:30] Hanolas: Btw I love how you theme your alts with their transmog and mounts etc. I aspire to do that to all of my alts!
[0:15:39] squishdotnet: its such a shame theyre horde
[0:16:05] amaya21: what horde race would you recommend for priest?
[0:16:06] AztraTheSupermage: I want Vulpera druids that transform into actual foves
[0:16:19] witchhobbit: @Hanolas yeah it makes them feel more important/unique with a little RP
[0:16:39] jakefx1: because of bugs. for me.
[0:17:05] Zuldak: One of the dracthyr calls the vulpera 'ferocious squirrels'
[0:17:10] Elrathir: Barnaclus is my other favorite of your characters, definitely do not purge, please thanks
[0:17:50] Chairo0o: used to hate camping, and swimming in the ocean. then i forced myself to di it a lot to stop myself fro missing out on cool experiences. now i love it!
[0:18:25] PortlandPeggy: Just spent 4 days glamping in the family room (no power)
[0:18:31] PortlandPeggy: definitely lost its allure
[0:18:51] cupcakechaos013: hazelLurk
[0:18:55] wolfcloudchaser80: Barnaclus just has such a presence
[0:18:59] heldtheline: Maybe when troll heritage armor is out?
[0:19:24] Zuldak: do you have any zandalari trolls? i dont think you do
[0:19:34] squishdotnet: ooh and theres those new troll cosmetics from ms. xuilan
[0:19:45] witchhobbit: yeah excited to see what itll look like
[0:19:57] Kurama__95: The 6 month long FOMO LUL
[0:20:20] Zuldak: the new gold beetle goes with the zandalari troll look pretty well
[0:20:26] heldtheline: I'm hoping draenei heritage armor is more shaman-y than paladin-y or else it's too much like LFD heritage stuff.
[0:20:30] Elrathir: it's been so long since good darkspear troll gear
[0:21:17] witchhobbit: i want draenei armor to be anything crystal-y
[0:21:27] Zuldak: yeah when i think of dranei, i think of the BC Box art guy with the purple crystal mace
[0:21:34] witchhobbit: love me some pretty rocks
[0:22:05] Zuldak: palworld?
[0:22:12] necr0me0wcer: I hope it will look like armor from that old draenei concept art
[0:22:19] GreenArrowed: cake baking?
[0:22:26] GreenArrowed: oh
[0:22:30] amaya21: nice!!
[0:22:41] dvkJoe: Hi, Hazel👋
[0:22:47] AztraTheSupermage: I'm so proud of you! :-D
[0:22:51] amaya21: may she grow up well
[0:23:54] komolana: woah wait when you make sourdough its the  same starter for different loaves?
[0:23:57] morphexia: how do you make a starter ? haah
[0:24:25] komolana: thats so coool and now i feel like i definitely know nothing about bread
[0:24:57] morphexia: what hahah why i thought it was more complicated
[0:25:22] morphexia: you can? how haha
[0:26:32] Uchiha_Cloaky: Hi there chat
[0:26:44] Zuldak: I have the feeling the AA characters are one piece references. I know Nirobin is a refernce to Nico Robin
[0:26:57] mcxoney: how did you get into bread making
[0:27:04] Uchiha_Cloaky: I still dont undetstand these azerothian archives and things quick explain plz?
[0:27:04] smashenater: hewwo GunRun everyone, this event was really confusing day one lol
[0:27:19] morphexia: remember you were talking about sourdough pizza. is it worth making_?
[0:27:26] wolfcloudchaser80: I've read that sourdough is interesting in that it quickly changes to match its environment. Take San Francisco sourdough yeast out of the bay area, and it'll stop tasting like San Francisco style.
[0:27:33] Zuldak: dont sell yourself too short. You make bread which is miles ahead of most people
[0:27:40] jakefx1: as the great Oprah once said, "I. Love. Bread."
[0:28:21] jeffdmk: such a unique teenage hobby
[0:29:58] GreenArrowed: mine is rice
[0:30:06] ellor3a: have you notice the Excavator hat not dropping at all? @hazelnuttygames
[0:30:10] Juspassnthru: Goodmorning luv the stream even though I'm for THE HORDE!
[0:30:15] Zhenedra: hazelWave
[0:30:16] Zuldak: do you prefer a specific type of rice at all?
[0:30:22] gherkinslice: Fresh warm bread with butter is the GOAT
[0:30:24] AeresTwo: who do you think first left out flour and water and then when it got all weird, decided to eat it
[0:30:28] komolana: pasta is def the way to my heart in that category mm
[0:30:41] Zuldak: ...plain rice with margarine?
[0:30:48] averageteacup: I want to make tea cakes, never baked before :D
[0:30:56] Zuldak: yeah the short grain white is good
[0:31:27] komolana: when i was young as a family we'd always have pasta with pesto and we used to call it "bogey pasta"
[0:31:33] komolana: to this day thats my number one comfort carb
[0:31:41] taylin33: growing up we had rice with sugar and milk for breakfast.
[0:31:53] wolfcloudchaser80: One of our reliable easy dishes is chicken and rice. Simple as it sounds (plus some garlic salt). Wonder if that would work pescatarian style?
[0:32:00] Zuldak: I like making lazy sushi: a rice bowl with the roll ingredients just thrown in. It's the same stuff just without the effort of making them into bite sized rolls
[0:32:34] ahnn112: are digs worth to do on alts?
[0:33:20] zrealous: had a funny thought if you swapped hair randomly in the middle of stream or weekly video
[0:33:27] nyrhalahotep: @Zuldak like a Poke bowel 😄
[0:33:45] Cainnar: is there a 1-a-week per character bonus?  not the account wide 5k, but its like 500?
[0:33:52] shootidruidy: Pasta with anything.. my favorite is elbow macaroni with tomatoes.. plain and simple
[0:33:56] russtrotter: eating out of big bowl is underrated... cleanest way to eat saucy food
[0:34:21] Zuldak: what we do for our rice is throw in garlic and vinegar in the rice cooker so the whole batch is infused with flavor
[0:34:38] Zuldak: the bent shrimp yoga position
[0:35:01] russtrotter: the "plating" of food is for softies and boomers.. big bowlin 4 lyfe
[0:35:06] Perkolate: yeah used to make rice in the rice maker with broth substituted for water. so good.
[0:35:46] Zuldak: yeah like growing up i ONLY put water in when cookign rice and my wife blew my mind by adding all sorts of things into the rice cooker
[0:35:46] jakefx1: Where is the vendor for dig currency? I am so lost
[0:35:56] MysteriousMind: we make japanese mushroom rice often, you season the rice in the cooker and throw mushrooms on top that steam in there, then mix when its done, so good!
[0:36:47] IanSabrewolfe: At 12 after?  You definitely missed it, yeah.
[0:36:48] Octopixy1971: LUL
[0:37:09] jeffdmk: what do you think about lubber being removed?
[0:37:23] jakefx1: ok, thanks! Im paying close attention!
[0:37:31] Zuldak: subbing with prime is annoying. There is always like a 2 hour lag when it expires and when you can resub
[0:37:45] jeffdmk: the hearthstone card lubber was removed from bgs
[0:37:47] jakefx1: TYTY
[0:38:04] Perkolate: yeah the pirate ele one that every refresh would gurantee a spell in the tavern
[0:38:08] IanSabrewolfe: @Zuldak And no way to set it up to re-up automatically.
[0:38:44] cashthb: henlo
[0:40:17] mrsrockguru: I liked the questline for them
[0:40:23] eielwind: oh! the claws for concern world quest is up hazel!
[0:40:24] MetaD42: thats a cool world quest add on what is it called?
[0:40:27] eielwind: if you didnt see
[0:40:53] eielwind: huh mine was up last night
[0:41:11] Grim_Kibishii: Is this the 12 month mount?
[0:42:15] Max_Battle: Do Primal Storms (design Lariat) still happen?
[0:42:34] caradosailanthus: Yes, they still happen
[0:42:43] witchhobbit: @Grim_Kibishii the tree dragon you can also get on a 6 month sub
[0:42:54] mcxoney: do you still play animal crossing?
[0:43:23] Zuldak: oh! so i am redoing the emerald dream story. At the siege of amirdrasil, i found both chromie and eternus working together. Could the infinite dragons join the good flights?
[0:43:27] fragaden: Hey Hazel and chatters
[0:43:40] Zuldak: also i wanna redeem Morchie D:
[0:43:41] caradosailanthus: @Max_Battle WoWhead will have which zone the Primal Storm is happening in or when the next one will start
[0:43:58] necrowoof: if you do the weekly on 6 characters you can get the finally at rest achievement and the pet
[0:43:58] Max_Battle: @caradosailanthus Been on for many hours and looked for it at the top of the hour... havent seen any?
[0:44:03] fibiane46: oh worldquests exist? didnt even knew that ^^ i just keep farming digs every hour
[0:44:03] IanSabrewolfe: Have you tried the Dragon Rider add on by keyboardturner, Hazel?
[0:44:16] mrsrockguru: or upstairs
[0:44:18] Max_Battle: @caradosailanthus Yeah I looked
[0:44:36] caradosailanthus: @Zuldak There is a quest line to explore this story over by the Dawn of the Infinites dungeon
[0:45:03] AnarchyMoose: wow youre hair is different color from yesterday!
[0:46:08] macydoes_: hazel im loving your wig era!
[0:46:09] riisoz: where do you get your wigs?
[0:46:16] AnarchyMoose: why SHOULDNT i buy this mohawk wig yanko
[0:46:39] IanSabrewolfe: So what you are saying is wigs are like D&D dice?
[0:47:04] macydoes_: i am so close to getting 3k IO but this week's affixes are a nightmare :(
[0:47:08] snowblood0: snowblood0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! Happy Saturday-versary
[0:47:08] Streamlabs: snowblood0 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[0:47:09] IanSabrewolfe: I DEFINITELY need to stay away from them, then, lol.
[0:47:30] eielwind: lol afflicted was so broke
[0:47:33] caradosailanthus: @Max_Battle Hmm I'll keep an eye out.  It should still be around
[0:47:57] Kurama__95: I'm having the worst time pugging 19s/20s as warrior
[0:48:08] necrowoof: the first boss in atal dazar was eating the afflicted npcs
[0:48:09] macydoes_: afflicted in the 2nd boss of galakrond fall lol my healer is having a mental breakdown
[0:48:39] Zuldak: you were preserving the relics in honey
[0:49:03] eielwind: yep thats timeways lol
[0:49:13] Diabetelicious: Timeways on tyrannical is nightmare fuel- add more dispels and it's unplayable lol
[0:49:31] brad1575: I got one and it turned into midnight :D
[0:49:43] Zuldak: the afflicted are super buggy this week eating smart heals
[0:49:45] bobbydor: fall is miserable on healers. I got my 20 and I refuse to run it anymore
[0:50:54] kazzjenkins: o/
[0:51:16] Kurama__95: I'm wiping on a key as we speak, sry about the delay response, but I'm having a hard time getting invited (can't deal with affix) and most groups are failing hard :(
[0:54:38] Kurama__95: I'm happy Shadow Priest is getting buffed next reset tho, it's one of my favorite specs in the game
[0:55:58] Zuldak: @Kurama__95 what level of keys you pushing?
[0:56:04] fallingupwards: What class do you play kurama?
[0:56:47] Status_85: Status_85 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! <3
[0:56:47] Streamlabs: status_85 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:57:45] Kurama__95: @Zuldak I'm trying to push 19s/20s on my warrior
[0:58:13] Zuldak: @Kurama__95 this week is pretty terrible. I failed a 21 rise last night because of bad afflicted placement and the boss just being mean
[0:58:24] fallingupwards: Ohh. Warriors getting hard declined this week bc of afflicted. If you can make your own grp with friends you'll have an easier time
[0:58:41] jakefx1: I no-lifed the TRs when they first started. they were fun in the beginning!
[0:58:59] Zuldak: also pro tip: do not melee stack your group for the rise dungeon. it gets very chaotic
[0:59:00] jakefx1: same!
[0:59:30] tim40361: tim40361 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[0:59:30] Streamlabs: tim40361 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:59:41] Kurama__95: @Zuldak I was the only melee aside from the tank and we wiped twice on Deios from bombs. We wiped every boss to either mechanics or not enough healing
[0:59:56] eleusis77: your autonomous cat has turned its back on chat
[1:00:19] Zuldak: this is just a stinky week and honestly i kinda wish they would remove affixes all together.
[1:00:21] Kurama__95: @fallingupwards I thought about it, but I usually prefer pugging keys as I can do them when I feel like it and raid only with friends, but I might start begging today lmao
[1:00:35] komolana: komolana subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:00:35] Streamlabs: komolana just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:00:44] Zuldak: anyone else miss the A triumphant roar echoes from atop the Seat of the Aspects as Nasz'uro, the Unbound Legacy, is formed spam?
[1:00:55] Ryok: anyone know is the goggle wobble achievement bugged? i danced with the npc during all 3 intro quests and didn't get it D:
[1:00:55] Drewcifer_1: as a healing main, afflicted affix is one week I refuse to heal.. I'll change to dps
[1:00:58] komolana: hazelLove
[1:01:07] Kurama__95: I wish every affix was a kiss/curse situation like the seasonal ones were, most right now are either boring or non-relevant
[1:02:11] eziekiyah: were you wearing the glasses? I tried it without the glasses on at first but then figured it out
[1:02:44] Ryok: @eziekiyah that might be it... i hope it was in the first one then and not the 2nd D: definitely wore them at the 3rd
[1:03:52] jeffreach: 2 raiders from jeffreach have joined!

[1:04:41] Abma13: keyboard is actually ok
[1:04:49] twennybunny: Hi Hazel! It looks like our raid party has to wait for 10 minutes to spread the raid message but we wanted to say hello!
[1:04:52] Abma13: it was getting to the carpet quickly though
[1:05:03] maachen: I hate this guy so much. I die more to this version than the original
[1:05:39] twennybunny: I'm sorry to hear that D: I dont blame you
[1:05:55] twennybunny: hazelWave hazelWave hazelWave hazelWave

[1:07:04] jgbrit: Did you finish the paladin legion Hall?
[1:07:05] Terra___l: 2 hours fishing in gilneas and still dont have googles..
[1:07:07] daws001: feels so good to have full flight as Drac now.
[1:07:16] lenny_ed: I got Lord Godfrey's specs after 6 casts today, thanks for the tip
[1:07:34] Zuldak: the big advantage of soar is that you dont use an energy to lift off
[1:07:38] Ryok: huh weird... i just danced with zenata in the waking shores WQ and it gave it to me xD must've not worn the glasses during the tutorial
[1:07:45] cashthb: I usually do the rep one too, they do turn into ~2k gold eventuall
[1:07:58] cashthb: *ones
[1:08:13] amaya21: yeah took me a while 2 but finally got them
[1:08:24] Cabbageman007: so Disappointed in Gilneas, wanted a Hearthstone inn there and viablitity there
[1:08:27] komolana: omg its ages since i saw the kyrian hangout place
[1:08:56] amaya21: if you have a worgen you can loot the toy that brings you back to gilneas
[1:08:56] dergNwolf: shadowlands was so bad for my non-engi alts
[1:08:57] necr0me0wcer: wow seems like I've got really lucky with those glasses, I've got them on my second catch LUL
[1:09:03] Terra___l: what was the name from the mission add on?
[1:09:07] dergNwolf: until zereth mortis, at which point they just stayed THERE and only there
[1:09:10] amaya21: really?
[1:09:18] amaya21: aaaah ok
[1:09:20] twennybunny: Thats interesting
[1:09:30] eziekiyah: oh thats goot to know..my wargan is only lvl 30
[1:09:30] Terra___l: thanks
[1:09:36] twennybunny: I thought everyone got it regardless of worgen up until seeing ur vid this morning
[1:09:41] caradosailanthus: @Max_Battle I see a Primal Storm in Ohn'ahran Plains right now - Earthen.  I had to click on the zone to see it, it was not showing at the higher level showing all the zones.
[1:09:43] Zuldak: nice. Means i am only missing 15 toys
[1:10:11] shootidruidy: it took me 118 cast to get the goggles
[1:10:13] twennybunny: hate to raid and run but gotta grab some lunch!
[1:10:36] twennybunny: I thought you had talked about Gilneas
[1:10:39] twennybunny: Either way
[1:10:43] twennybunny: Have a good one!~
[1:10:46] caradosailanthus: @Max_Battle It's listed on WoWhead right now, but it looks like they are not showing the upcoming ones.
[1:11:00] Max_Battle: @caradosailanthus checking
[1:11:09] diarrhea_lad: good morning! I sliced up a bunch of onions this morning for french onion soup, which is going in the crock pot
[1:11:13] Cabbageman007: voidform?
[1:11:17] gnashed: didnt wow add a rouge like dungeon in shadowlands?
[1:11:57] cashthb: you think you like gonems so much because you're also really short irl?
[1:12:12] Zuldak: I feel like the archive is a bit of an experiment to see how much players will interact with a faction with zero player power
[1:12:18] VanirElf: wait, you're short ?
[1:12:20] squishdotnet: isnt she 6'10
[1:12:24] squishdotnet: *5'10
[1:12:26] antiva: how tall are you??
[1:12:28] necr0me0wcer: @cashthb but she's very tall LUL
[1:12:33] shootidruidy: im 4'9"... i do not play gnomes lol
[1:12:39] diarrhea_lad: I still think they could have had a "revamped" torghast with some bronze dragonflight shenanigans. Like "here's  a timeline where Murlocks and Gnolls allied together"
[1:12:44] amaya21: how much in meters? :P
[1:12:51] dergNwolf: @Zuldak Winterfell Furbolgs!
[1:12:55] dergNwolf: they had that in 10.0.5
[1:12:56] antiva: tall queen!!!
[1:12:57] Max_Battle: @caradosailanthus I see it on wowhead, cant see on map, will take my JC there for scout
[1:12:59] VanirElf: archeology 2.0
[1:13:02] 6thbiscuit: I have the same Horde-side though. Mog looks great on Blood Elves, but Goblins though :)
[1:13:20] VanirElf: I got the mount from the boss
[1:13:35] Kurama__95: I was also surprised by how many ppl are digging just for cosmetics
[1:13:36] Zuldak: I kinda wonder how many players only interact with systems like M+ in pursuit of cosmetics.
[1:14:00] witchhobbit: i feel like they must test mog on humans before any other races first
[1:14:18] Kurama__95: @Zuldak In a way, people who do keys over 20 do it for the leaderboard score, which could be considered cosmetic (I think?)
[1:14:22] Diabetelicious: I do m+ for the worst cosmetic of rio score
[1:14:42] Ekemon88: with the recent inflation additions to the pvp ladder feels so much better like SL days, attainable rewards
[1:14:44] Zuldak: like how many players would be playing M+ if the reward was like ugly rags but with a lot of player power? So no cosmetics but just power rewards
[1:14:46] NateDoktor: twenny2Raidrainbow twenny2Raidrainbow TWENNY AND JEFF RAID! HOPPIN ON IN! twenny2Raidrainbow
[1:15:07] Drewcifer_1: and so begins the long journey of me playing classing to get ready for cata
[1:15:15] dergNwolf: @Zuldak so bfa raid sets
[1:15:17] dergNwolf: gaySip
[1:15:23] VanirElf: As a priest main Hazel, are you a fan of the current priest tier appearance, and which is your favorite color of the 4 available ?
[1:15:28] Ekemon88: Gl on the mount :D !
[1:15:37] Triskelian: I swore troll/dranei heritage armor was this patch
[1:15:42] dergNwolf: bfa raid sets are one of the rare cosmetics that deserve getting called out again and again
[1:16:09] dergNwolf: heritage is 10.2.7!
[1:16:13] Elrathir: s2 is probably the best priest set of all time
[1:16:17] Max_Battle: @caradosailanthus ok seen thanks for heads up
[1:16:18] VanirElf: u don't use the catalyst to finish it ?
[1:16:27] Woodled: some of the pieces dont even drop from the raid, you need to use the catalyst
[1:16:29] Elrathir: I do really like the priest set from Mythic Nighthold though
[1:16:29] blissy416: @Triskelian it was draenei skin colour and troll hair colour
[1:16:47] Zuldak: oh! so i need the bracers and legs still to complete the mythic tier mog set. I was preparing to grind out heroic track bracers and legs... but then someone pointed out i am WEARING heroic track legs and bracers...
[1:16:52] dergNwolf: idk I really love the Season 3 Shaman set
[1:16:54] Zuldak: so i am waiting for charges now
[1:17:08] dergNwolf: like, the season 3 shaman set is the sole reason I swapped my main to Shaman cause... I couldn't stand being augvoker anymore
[1:17:25] witchhobbit: you have to remember to use the catalyst at certain levels before upgrading which is annoying
[1:17:26] VanirElf: i <3 the current mage set, been on M+ grind to get the full appearance for the mythic set
[1:17:39] dagoxd1986: i just dont sell anything until season end
[1:17:43] dagoxd1986: s
[1:17:54] diarrhea_lad: I made a second DK solely so I could use more catalyst charges for LFR recolor
[1:18:01] Zuldak: you can get 2 tier piece colors per single item. Like you catalze a lfr piece for the lfr color then upgrade to normal apperence
[1:18:02] amaya21: confusing
[1:18:07] Ekemon88: hazel get your glad mount this season :D looking like a good season
[1:18:12] Zuldak: then a heroic piece, catalyze and then upgrade to mythic
[1:18:13] Kurama__95: I went a bit mental at the end of S2 where I got every tint of tier set from LFR and Normal for every class, and every tint for Priest and Rogue. All through Catalyst conversion
[1:18:17] VanirElf: they change they made to getting 1 weekly catalyst charge is awesome
[1:18:18] jakefx1: yeah thats too much, I just catalize an item if I dont have the catalized apperance!
[1:18:50] Zuldak: See! now people kinda understand why I have 9 druids geared at 450+
[1:18:56] Zuldak: easier to get the sets
[1:19:02] Ekemon88: i wish one day there is follower raids as well
[1:19:05] bobbydor: also war within transmog changes
[1:19:26] cashthb: what's that mount? horde tol barad horse?
[1:19:31] VanirElf: the pain of xmog farming old raids :(
[1:19:38] Zuldak: i dont think TWW is going to change tier set acquisition since you need the class to get their tier set
[1:19:44] cashthb: ah, makes sense
[1:19:46] linnydota: what addon are you using to keep track of the drops?
[1:19:49] Kurama__95: If they're going by the poll, the priest S2 set is gonna return on S4, so it's a second chance for you to get it LUL
[1:19:50] Ekemon88: Ekemon88 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to HazelNuttyGames's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[1:19:51] Streamlabs: ekemon88 just gifted 1 Tier 1 subscriptions!
[1:19:51] Ekemon88: Ekemon88 gifted a Tier 1 sub to LizzyShan! 
[1:19:53] blissy416: follower raids would be a cool way to end timewalking while leveling
[1:19:56] VanirElf: i'm missing 1 piece from the mage throne of thunder set from the LFR version but it's not a boss drop it's from trash
[1:19:58] blissy416: like questing through northrend and finishing with ICC
[1:20:09] Terra___l: i upgrade one item from 7/8 to 8/8 and got a new transmog didnt even know that
[1:21:03] goplacidly56: dig is coming up
[1:21:11] cashthb: jump of the bridge myb
[1:21:24] pet_pepi_rus: crinkles a runner, crinkle is a tracksta!
[1:21:58] Woodled: big dig seems very slow going for rep and for fragments, do you think its worth to just farm the WQ's when they are available?
[1:22:46] Eirchi: Hi Hazel! Floyd here now!
[1:22:49] KNGJON: VoHiYo
[1:23:42] Zandia: I only get fragments from the first wq of the 3, the two others changes to gold rewards after I did the first ones O_O
[1:23:44] kitkatsue: kitkatsue subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! Good morning Hazel.
[1:23:44] Streamlabs: kitkatsue just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:24:05] enokifungus: where is big dig now?
[1:24:06] s_0lst1ce: @Zandia same
[1:24:16] Zandia: Also, I can't see those wq's on anlu alts
[1:24:17] sence_00: yah that was disappointing, i hoped it would be more fragments
[1:24:21] Zandia: any
[1:24:31] Triskelian: Aww, Honeybear🥰 I call my pupper Boobear <3 <3 <3
[1:24:44] amaya21: i think so
[1:24:53] Zandia: So the big dig on main is kinda the only source of fragments it seems, atleast for now
[1:24:57] Eirchi: Why did they invent a new type of archaeology that's worse than the old archaeology in every way?
[1:25:28] little_c2222: Me too
[1:25:29] antiva: the pink wig looks great on you hazel! <3
[1:25:34] wolfcloudchaser80: I like the new version.
[1:26:12] Zuldak: i think players just like to complain
[1:26:16] Curufin_: for anyone that has done all the pristine artifact achieves, its not fun! ^^
[1:26:36] Zuldak: 'blizz, make it better but do not change anything'
[1:26:46] cinnatoasto_: As a real life archivist I feel like I must mention that this thing we're doing to get an archivist title, is not archiving at all!
[1:26:48] little_c2222: It's like something you want to go back and do when you have time but you never have time cuz there's always a content update
[1:27:01] cashthb: got all the toys?
[1:27:05] necrowoof: zin rok does not exist
[1:27:12] endless_pastrami: if you really wanna do an archeology grind there is the archeology legion artifact recolor
[1:27:15] Kurama__95: I'm not a fan of old archeologist and I welcome any attempt to improve it LUL
[1:27:19] fragaden: "it belongs in a museum"
[1:27:20] pet_pepi_rus: I think it’s supposed to be more like the archeology we use today in real life. where we summon elementals from totems to find treasure and use goggles to look at the past
[1:27:34] Ujai321: Morning. Who's your friend?
[1:28:36] Zuldak: chat distracted you with the rice cooking and bread
[1:28:46] cinnatoasto_: Do you have the same problem where some achievements don't show up? I'm trying to get old achievements, but some of them do not show up!
[1:28:49] Ujai321: Did you let the alarm clock do its thing today?
[1:28:54] Triskelian: Did you get the new Pepe appearances Hazel?
[1:29:16] Woodled: oh awesome! sourdough is fun to make but im not a huge fan of the taste lol
[1:29:58] Ujai321: ... It's apparently tough to sleep with the thing
[1:30:40] brazkat: do you get arch skill for these events?
[1:30:41] Ujai321: Yeah, the watch can serve you the (few, for you) notifications
[1:31:14] KNGJON: does an apple watch have a alarm that goes off? or have the capability to function as an alarm?
[1:31:14] Ujai321: Do you have an actual land line?
[1:31:21] s_0lst1ce: thanks for the tip on the interact button on the news video, it has made clicking on the piles so much easier
[1:32:10] Eirchi: Hazel, did you have a Princess phone during your Rural Canadian Upbringing?
[1:32:26] dergNwolf: dergNwolf subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:32:27] Streamlabs: dergnwolf just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:32:35] dergNwolf: tippiEgg
[1:32:47] komolana: omg that era of tech aesthetic was sooo good
[1:33:04] caroll96003: I use headphones while on the phone.
[1:33:04] Ujai321: Harsh
[1:33:10] Ujai321: For a teenager
[1:33:26] cinnatoasto_: Plastic, inflatable, transparent furniture was SO cool
[1:33:50] Ujai321: Did you come up with a coded language with your friends in your Rural Canadian Upbringing?
[1:33:51] cinnatoasto_: Wait, how old are you?
[1:34:00] witchhobbit: i love keeping my phone on silence but apparently that is a problem for everyone LUL
[1:34:11] witchhobbit: i hate hearing it ring or buzz
[1:34:30] Zuldak: i remmber playing popcap bejeweled on a flip phone
[1:34:35] Ujai321: You speak French?
[1:35:12] komolana: what would be your dream language to speak, if you could just wake up one morning and speak it without needing to learn?
[1:35:27] cashthb: you can't know with Canada
[1:35:39] Zuldak: Zuldak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! Woo 26
[1:35:39] Streamlabs: zuldak just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[1:35:51] Ujai321: It's not need, it's want
[1:35:53] amaya21: the backpack dropped!! :D
[1:36:11] Zuldak: the pro esports phase
[1:36:15] Ujai321: North or South?
[1:36:26] witchhobbit: i also wanted to learn korean when i got into kpop lol
[1:36:27] amaya21: ty! :)
[1:36:27] fleet21_: mandarin or spanish for me
[1:36:28] Zuldak: move into a gamehouse and take over TSM
[1:36:33] caradosailanthus: Japanese would be fun for anime
[1:36:39] cinnatoasto_: Hey don't let your dreams be memes!
[1:36:51] wolfcloudchaser80: Korean written language is super easy to learn. The actual spoken language.... yikes.
[1:37:03] caradosailanthus: Though Korean for K-drama would be cool too
[1:37:08] Zuldak: esports presents teams as 'friends' who work together to be the best. Reality is nothing like that
[1:37:29] Eirchi: When I had some spare time I learned the binary language of moisture vaporators
[1:37:43] sanguinette: Just got keystone máster for the first time ever. So proud
[1:37:54] Zuldak: @sanguinette GRATS!
[1:38:09] daws001: sign me up!
[1:38:12] sanguinette: hazelLove
[1:38:15] Ujai321: So what you did
[1:38:17] Zuldak: yeah even the general wow player doesnt appreciate the top pvpers
[1:38:22] Triskelian: @eirchi C3PO confirmed:D
[1:38:28] Ryok: hmm... how do i get to gilneas after doing the scenario... do i just fly there? D:
[1:38:28] fleet21_: owl died Sadge
[1:39:02] SaraDivine: 238,000 fragments is what att says
[1:39:08] cinnatoasto_: The voice of that vendor.. is that the same voice actor as Xal'atath?
[1:39:08] Zuldak: wow is  much more about pve. Id argue Max from TL is more famous to the average wow player than Hafu or Azael
[1:39:09] Papavodo: anyone got the hat drop from the dig yet?
[1:39:22] wolfcloudchaser80: Alchemy is getting annoying. People buy up gold Primal Convergent instantly... but all the silver ones just sit on the AH.
[1:39:34] SaraDivine: i was hoping it would be similar to time rifts where the vendor items can drop from the dig
[1:39:57] Ujai321: He is also just a good streamer
[1:40:26] Zuldak: well like Hafu i didnt even know she played wow for a long time. I discovered her through amongus
[1:40:34] Woodled: shes so small on top of that
[1:40:47] squishdotnet: what was the mount special on that thing
[1:41:09] Ujai321: I couldn't name the biggest pvp streamer to save my life
[1:41:13] squishdotnet: thats sorta lame
[1:41:29] bobbydor: pikaboo
[1:41:30] Kurama__95: Pikaboo is the first that comes to mind
[1:41:39] Perkolate: I find pika the most entertaining, plus has cat.
[1:41:51] kaur_q: soda is was the biggest pvp streamer
[1:42:06] Kurama__95: Pìkaboo is also not human, that man was born to do arenas
[1:42:13] Maggaeri: Crew is probably one of the top pvp streamers
[1:42:37] GreenArrowed: love max's dogs
[1:42:42] GreenArrowed: lil reptar who isn't lil anymore
[1:42:45] antiva: max's dogs are so cute
[1:42:54] fragaden: thats a perfect colab pitch
[1:42:58] Ujai321: They are also huge
[1:43:09] Maggaeri: Personally I prefer to watch men's stream
[1:43:41] antiva: lmfao smart choise
[1:43:42] Woodled: @Maggaeri yikes
[1:43:43] Octopixy1971: LUL
[1:43:44] Kurama__95: I was thinking the same thing lmao
[1:43:45] Perkolate: LUL
[1:43:47] Maggaeri: Stupid auto correct...mes
[1:43:53] Perkolate: hahahaha
[1:43:54] Zuldak: why are zalarak cavern mobs so dangerous?
[1:43:57] Elrathir: LUL
[1:43:58] Getcha_Pulll: lmao
[1:43:58] tehl00py: NotLikeThis
[1:44:00] jakefx1: whew!!!
[1:44:01] antiva: HAHAHA
[1:44:03] witchhobbit: lol
[1:44:05] Bettyann555: lol
[1:44:06] Getcha_Pulll: SAVED
[1:44:10] antiva: omfgg thats hilarious
[1:44:13] Neltalie: lmaoo
[1:44:13] eielwind: lmaaaaao
[1:44:15] Maggaeri: 😁
[1:44:23] allohomoraa: LUL
[1:44:24] uglyfem: 😭
[1:45:27] Maggaeri: I read that and was...WTF!!
[1:45:32] jakefx1: same. Im trying to do a little irl work in-between, and Im not being successful
[1:45:35] Getcha_Pulll: between digs I usually work on fruit of bloom achievement
[1:46:08] Zuldak: sadly i still do a weekly tormentors of torghast for one specific mob that drops a unique dagger ":/
[1:46:30] Kurama__95: I used to study while farming Rustfeather. Had the game alt tabbed and rarescanner would blow my ears off when it spawned LUL
[1:46:51] Eirchi: Hazel, are you a YouTube subscriber or do you use some sort of ad blocker?
[1:47:06] Zuldak: yeah wow achieves for points is a rabbit hole i do not mess with
[1:47:21] Ryok: can i fish anywhere for the glasses in gilneas?
[1:47:22] sence_00: I just broke 37000 achievement points and a lot of what is left is tedious grinds, or PVP
[1:47:24] cashthb: *most* exploration achievements up until bfa would fit your stream pretty well imo
[1:47:25] witchhobbit: same
[1:47:41] dergNwolf: omg taskmaster PridePog
[1:48:04] dergNwolf: I've learned about taskmaster like a month again and binged all 16 seasons PrideUwu
[1:48:10] dergNwolf: *a month ago
[1:48:35] dergNwolf: I've started the NZ one but need to get back to it
[1:49:00] dergNwolf: no alex horne and greg davies gaySad
[1:49:24] dergNwolf: yeah the NZ taskmaster is not as good as Greg but the assistant is not far off from Alex
[1:49:34] necr0me0wcer: how long it takes to farm Pandaria reputations? Kirin Tor Offensive specifically
[1:49:55] Eirchi: Hazel, did you try the Follower Dungeons?
[1:49:59] diarrhea_lad: MoP
[1:50:04] cashthb: not too long overall
[1:50:07] Kurama__95: Kirin Tor Offensive is the Isle of Thunder one
[1:50:09] chefdejour82: isle of thunder maybe
[1:50:15] furiforever: Buy tokens with Timewarped badges during the Pandaria timewalking, that will speed it up
[1:50:16] cashthb: and kirin tor offense is the isle of storm one
[1:50:17] helheimr: kirin tor offensive is isle of thunder MoP
[1:50:22] cashthb: *yeah thunder
[1:50:42] Triskelian: Kirin Tor was Alliance rep in MoP, Sunreavers was Horde
[1:50:56] necr0me0wcer: @furiforever yeah, that's pretty much what i'm gonna do anyway LUL
[1:51:00] Zuldak: that kadghar head pet thing is...weird
[1:51:02] Triskelian: I think
[1:51:12] cashthb: no, akshually, legion kirin tor used to old (mop) kirin tor faction
[1:51:23] dergNwolf: I think the Kirin Tor rep wqs in Legion straight up gave you the WotLK rep
[1:51:25] dergNwolf: ye
[1:51:25] cashthb: *wotlk
[1:51:30] sence_00: the head is from rep chests right?
[1:51:33] Triskelian: @zuldak I think you mean awesome
[1:51:35] cashthb: the legion kirin tor used the wotlk kirin tor
[1:52:05] witchhobbit: my suramar paragon mount took longer than my nazjatar one
[1:52:11] necr0me0wcer: i love this pet so much. it's so fun :D
[1:53:08] pet_pepi_rus: she’s doing her best ok
[1:53:22] komolana: im glad its not just me that struggles with balance despite it being my fave aesthetically :(
[1:53:29] komolana: had to give it up in the end :(
[1:53:45] Zuldak: their eagle flight form has antlers too
[1:53:58] Arabany: Make more taurens, they are like gnomes, but a bit taller
[1:54:09] jakefx1: yeah thats wild
[1:54:19] Arabany: I have 10 taurens, I think:)
[1:54:21] cashthb: well you could delete her and make a gnome 😈
[1:54:23] pet_pepi_rus: how else would you know it’s a high mountain Tauren?
[1:54:36] cashthb: or you could mak a gnome called metalbloom
[1:56:12] Zuldak: by the way if anyone has a bunch of dragon isle resources you dont want, you can go to loamm and exchange 100 supply for a boulder. Vendor the bolder for 24 gold
[1:56:44] squishdotnet: @Zuldak wait I can buy ponzos hat with supplies basically?
[1:57:03] Zuldak: yes
[1:57:10] squishdotnet: where is this magic vendor
[1:57:45] bordum: how that polar vortex been
[1:57:52] Eirchi: I actually had a Mr Potato Head when I was a kid, it was not a fun toy
[1:58:29] KrastorBrohoof: the bolders can be traded but you got to be renown 20 to do it
[1:58:39] Zuldak: this snow sucked. It was mostly sleet and then it froze into solid ice
[1:58:58] GreenArrowed: yess
[1:58:59] PortlandPeggy: ice upon more ice
[1:59:07] GreenArrowed: they had several power outages
[1:59:11] antiva: its been crazy cold here too. we hit our record low not long ago with -43 celsius
[1:59:12] PortlandPeggy: got at least 3 inches where i am
[1:59:19] bordum: just move to florida like everyone else guys lmao
[1:59:23] Zuldak: yeah it keeps thawing and refreezing but we're not getting any mroe of it so its going away slowly
[1:59:51] PortlandPeggy: the dog wants to play ball in the back yard but can't walk on the ice
[2:00:08] cashthb: there was only a few mms of snow here, weird how much difference a few thousand kilometres make
[2:00:13] Eirchi: Does Moose have his own Instagram yet?
[2:00:25] witchhobbit: i would take any amount of snow over florida any day
[2:00:44] antiva: do you have to deal with a lot of trolls with being a content creator on the internet?
[2:00:46] Arubicon: i live in canada and we spent the last week in -53 degree celcius weather which converts to the same in F
[2:01:05] Arubicon: Saskatchewan
[2:01:09] caradosailanthus: I would guess Alberta
[2:01:10] Reskendo: hello   what class is this?
[2:01:20] cashthb: what trolls?

[2:02:38] bordum: -53 i fell my bones moaning
[2:02:42] wolfcloudchaser80: I've only ever seen one particularly savvy troll in this chat, and I don't think that person lasted more than a day.
[2:02:46] Dasecondone: -53 with wind or without?
[2:02:53] Zuldak: HC self found soon!
[2:03:02] Arubicon: with..ambient was -44
[2:03:03] shadeux109: It's a great community and the streamer plays a big role in that :D

[2:03:52] antiva: this is the run, i feel it in my bones
[2:04:03] Eirchi: I like that they let you skip all the bosses in here
[2:04:38] witchhobbit: do the big digs usually take like 10 min to start?
[2:04:54] witchhobbit: i'm confused with the timing on these
[2:04:56] Cabbageman007: 48 tries got me Sharkbait
[2:04:58] bordum: i loved the mog sets for vault of incarnates but there NEVER any groups anymore
[2:05:08] Zockyzy: What's the transmog addon you use?
[2:05:14] shootidruidy: 30 min mark not the hour
[2:05:14] Lheela: Do you have the mount from kings rest? Because there is a neat trick to skip directly to the end boss there
[2:05:28] cashthb: @haleych you can mouse over the horn on the map
[2:05:57] Eirchi: When was the last time Moose had an indoor accident?
[2:06:08] witchhobbit: i thought it was every 30 min ahahahah
[2:06:09] Kurama__95: @bordum If you're only interested in class transmogs, you can farm the tokens from Forbidden Reach and catalyze them into VotI tier
[2:06:11] Reskendo: been doing BDO for some time now, need to check out wow hardcore, looks like fun
[2:06:18] antiva: i love that mummy raptor
[2:06:44] antiva: moose sounds so precious! very easily excitable little baby
[2:06:45] eielwind: the lockout sharing skip you had a video on years ago for mimirons head was life saving lol
[2:06:48] witchhobbit: got it, i kept hearing it said differently lol
[2:07:13] Perkolate: holy im' doing my first follower dungeon and the AI tank is pulling like we're practicing for the MDI
[2:07:23] goplacidly56: Prime says I can resub today but it's not working
[2:07:27] antiva: i need some moose in my life for free serotonin
[2:07:49] GreenArrowed: @Perkolate that happened to me, too!
[2:07:51] Zuldak: there was a facebook page of fedex drivers who loved greeting all the dogs as they made deliveries
[2:08:04] eielwind: they do I did it couple weeks ago
[2:08:19] bobbydor: just got invincible from the timewalking box last week. the drop rate was really high from the box
[2:08:20] HeyKairhys: I got Invincible thru Ulduar TW, lucky lol
[2:08:30] GreenArrowed: love a good tail thump
[2:08:33] baroner25: I was so mad when they changed that it took me 10 long years to get invincible to drop
[2:08:42] Zuldak: how dangerous are the tail wags? can he give people bruises?
[2:08:47] Eirchi: The Hunter and Healer AI followers are hilarious. The way they jump around in the dungeon and pull extra stuff
[2:09:12] komolana: musical boi on the bin :))
[2:09:33] antiva: we love a pup that knows his boundaries
[2:09:42] pet_pepi_rus: my advice for mount farming raids is to always go into the raid for different reasons and the mount will drop? the astral cloud serpent dropped for me when I was farming the pet! mirmirons head dropped when I was doing the Lucid Nightmare puzzle! and invincible dropped while I was doing the shadowmourne legendary. it just works!
[2:09:50] wolfcloudchaser80: My pup was that way, but loved neck-scratches
[2:10:26] Zuldak: oh boy, the undercoat blow
[2:11:17] Zuldak: its better than the street moss
[2:11:49] Eirchi: What's the most expensive thing that Moose has broken?
[2:11:52] Zuldak: it sounds like everything is on the moose menu
[2:11:56] goplacidly56: my dog does that too
[2:12:48] turbo_queenhm: Same with my boxer mix. I used to get him a bark box "tough" and the toys would be destroyed within hours haha.
[2:13:01] HeyKairhys: My dog once age a tractor tire
[2:13:04] Zuldak: the tables are just improved with his artistic touch
[2:13:12] eielwind: my dog bit the bottom of my bed frame lol
[2:13:14] goplacidly56: you might be able to just replace the legs
[2:13:41] antiva: my bunny absolutely destroyed my bed legs haha
[2:13:56] goplacidly56: My first dog ruined all my furniture, he'd even chew the corners of my nightstands
[2:13:59] Zuldak: if you show interest in it, moose is gonna take interest in it too and do it again
[2:14:09] turbo_queenhm: Haha my friend's bunny ate her baseboards antiva
[2:14:27] antiva: @ivory_wings oh yeah ive heard that tale many times
[2:14:28] Zuldak: cant wait till he learns the joy of digging in spring
[2:14:38] antiva: my bunny also ate for example my boyfriends new leather shoes D:
[2:14:40] Zuldak: its gonna be his first true spring as an adult
[2:15:26] Zuldak: imagine him going through the fields and seeing the flowers blooming....and him eating them
[2:16:03] Eirchi: Does he prefer watching Curling or Ice Hockey?
[2:16:11] Zuldak: maybe you should try and grow some of those yellow flowers ina  pot for him
[2:16:39] Libertybelle41: Incoming dumb question : How do you get back to the Ruins of Gilneas after you've completed the quest? I'd like to fish there
[2:16:42] Zuldak: are you looking to move now?
[2:16:43] cashthb: i thought you meant dinosaurs, way to kill the mood
[2:17:19] Libertybelle41: AHHH ok. Thank you <3
[2:17:21] Zuldak: for alliance the pet battle dungeon to strat might be your best bet
[2:17:26] Arabany: Can you go to the old version of Gilneas?
[2:17:53] eielwind: I was farming old ore in tbc and my god is it fast now with dragonriding
[2:17:58] Zuldak: ahh yeah ironforge... but how do you get to IF?
[2:18:06] goplacidly56: Can you keep doing the big dig on same toon all day?
[2:18:22] cashthb: just use your old dala portal, duh
[2:18:25] helheimr: or you take them tram
[2:18:29] goplacidly56: thanks
[2:18:34] Zuldak: the tram is not flast
[2:18:40] cashthb: old dala portal really puts in work nowadays
[2:18:50] antiva: i love the tram
[2:18:52] Eirchi: How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
[2:18:57] lenny_ed: same for horde with thunderbluff, use dezaralor
[2:18:59] antiva: im a public transportation fan
[2:19:32] Aness: Hi Hazel, you literally look like an anime character!  Love the wig!
[2:19:39] Eirchi: ooh, that's an old one, didn't you'd know it
[2:19:44] Zuldak: i saw a tiktoc of 'you know youre living it when youre 19 and picked up by a 300,000 ride' and it's a girl getting on a public bus
[2:20:00] eielwind: those dice would never drop for me on M+ though of course
[2:20:14] Aness: Have you had a chance to try Palworld, yet?
[2:20:32] antiva: we need busses on wow
[2:20:38] Aness: There is SO much happening, it is a little overwhelming
[2:20:48] antiva: pal world looks cute but im so turned off by all the guns n stuff
[2:21:04] Aness: It's too much for my fragile soul right now!  I will just stick to Disney Dreamlight Valley
[2:21:05] wolfcloudchaser80: I'm debating Palworld... probably would only be a thing if my partner is also interested.
[2:21:12] Perkolate: Jans and I are gonna start goin in on it. I gotta buy it now haha
[2:21:14] wolfcloudchaser80: Nice to have a wow-alternative.
[2:21:26] cashthb: how about playing quake 2 instead? it has guns, and arguably pokekmon too
[2:21:36] eielwind: I tried it a little last night, definitely overwhelming to start for me
[2:22:02] AnarchyMoose: games with friends >>>
[2:22:05] eielwind: enshrouded comes out next week I think?
[2:22:06] Perkolate: this upcoming Wed for enshrouded!
[2:22:47] eielwind: what is enshrouded like game-wise?
[2:22:53] eielwind: I haven’t seen much on it
[2:23:05] Kaseyfullofjoy: 2min warnin fer dig
[2:23:18] antiva: ohh valheim is so good for my little gathering-loving brain
[2:23:39] eielwind: I was hoping Palia would be a bit bigger
[2:23:53] Kaseyfullofjoy: oh ive been adoring valheim lately! been playin that and loggin on for digs lol
[2:24:05] vikutoru11: good afternoon, Hazel. What's that addon that shows the strategy for pet battles?
[2:24:21] HazelNuttyGames: !xufu
[2:24:21] Streamlabs: Find lists of most-used pets, import teams, look up strategies and more on https://www.wow-petguide.com/

[2:24:43] Zuldak: whats for lunch?
[2:25:15] vikutoru11: what are your top 3 pets?
[2:25:19] Eirchi: Hazel, did you get a pile of pet charms in your mail from the conversion?
[2:25:21] Zuldak: Kira agrees with nap
[2:25:48] cinder_elliot: Hazel! It's been a while, how's it goin
[2:25:49] eielwind: I was very confused about those pet charms in the mail
[2:25:57] Eirchi: Anubsynth Idol, cause he's your buddy!
[2:26:03] Zuldak: i use iron star a lot
[2:26:11] cinder_elliot: hanging in there. thanks for playing retail so i don't have to!
[2:26:29] cashthb: ikky - starlet - nexus/stormbon imo
[2:26:55] antiva: @HazelNuttyGames important question: whats your favourite carbonated drink?
[2:27:05] Tuk87: do you have your own recipe for enchiladas or do you follow some specific one usually?
[2:27:24] Papavodo: I am still saving mine yet to spen lol nearing 30k lol
[2:27:51] eielwind: improv, gasp
[2:28:22] vikutoru11: what about top 3 most pretty pets in your opinion?
[2:29:31] turaw_kemor: that little duck thing, reminded me of the trex from meet the robinsons, "I got a big head, and little arms!"
[2:29:40] eielwind: Tobias ❤️❤️
[2:29:57] vikutoru11: they're very cute <3
[2:30:01] Libertybelle41: Whoa! I just got Lord Godfey's glasses after 2 casts. TWO casts. That just never happens for me...Unless it's super easy to fish up.
[2:30:06] fragaden: Do you have an absolute favorite pet? forgive me if you have said it already
[2:30:18] eielwind: listen real puppies can have hats
[2:30:18] l_Denix_l: Tobias is a good boy
[2:31:02] fragaden: I respect that
[2:31:05] l_Denix_l: for me? >.<
[2:31:22] Zuldak: i remember back in the day before pet battles were a thing i grinded out the drakes as companions
[2:31:38] Raineve: WAT! 1700 woah lol
[2:31:51] Zuldak: yep red, blue black and emerald
[2:31:51] fragaden: i don't go out of my way to collect them. But i always welcome more pets added to my army
[2:32:08] eielwind: I got a pet in siege of orgrimmar that I need but it sells for 70k which is so tempting
[2:32:13] Aseopp: Rock and roll will soothe the savage soul
[2:32:32] fragaden: wow. i have 210...
[2:32:38] antiva: the green whelpling almost killed my mental fortitude, it took so long to drop
[2:32:42] eielwind: I did learn it haha
[2:33:10] emrys871: emrys871 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Hazel. In my opinion I personally think Blizzard should do a currency squish. After playing Classic SoD seeing millions of gold seems ridiculous, thoughts?
[2:33:11] Streamlabs: emrys871 just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:33:11] eielwind: I have like 250 pet duplicates I’m trying to sell, sell like one a week it seems
[2:33:59] emrys871: Maybe a currency revamp then>
[2:34:02] wolfcloudchaser80: Could just add a platinum coin.
[2:34:18] cashthb: told ya before, we need an expansion where inflation is the main villian
[2:34:35] Zuldak: if blizz wants to remove gold from the economy offer up another 5m gold mount
[2:34:35] Veedellmuffin: Is this digging stuff a seasonal thing or permanent?
[2:34:40] Eirchi: Gold Pressed Latinum
[2:35:01] fragaden: I tried the follower dungeons...its alright. I was worried the pace was going to be an issue like trusts tend to be.
[2:35:36] emrys871: I just miss the days when having 100k gold was alot, lol
[2:35:38] eielwind: I did 5 Nokhud followers and got no breath and gave up
[2:35:50] Eirchi: Hazel, would you want all of the AH to be region wide and not just consumables?
[2:36:22] Zuldak: i was farming the goblin trash between the 1st and 2nd boss in deadmines trying to get this goblin screwdriver mog thing
[2:36:31] Zuldak: hows that for obscure?
[2:36:45] AnarchyMoose: AH scans take a million years even now though RIP TSM Dx
[2:36:57] fragaden: sounds screwy
[2:37:22] wolfcloudchaser80: Really? Auctionator takes just a few seconds.
[2:37:29] Zuldak: its a dagger mog called goblin screwdriver. it looks like a normal dagger lol
[2:37:29] BisonD: Liar!
[2:37:35] BisonD: thats quick
[2:37:38] jeffdmk: does the stop watch go up to years?
[2:37:46] AnarchyMoose: i feel like 17 seconds is a million years xD at least when it used to be like 5 seconds haha
[2:37:56] emrys871: so Tldr Auctionator > TSM confirmed
[2:38:17] emrys871: lol
[2:38:24] eielwind: do you still have to scan the ah with tsm if you have desktop app?
[2:38:31] AnarchyMoose: i still have TSM just for the mailbox UI and stuff
[2:38:42] lenny_ed: I use both, depeneds what I do
[2:38:46] wolfcloudchaser80: I only keep TSM around now because it has a detailed history of my gold income. And I like seeing that chart go up!
[2:38:50] turaw_kemor: time to level another toon to run freehold with
[2:39:04] Zuldak: i cant get over how the archivist torch is upside down and makes you look like youre on fire
[2:39:31] MrSonicgen: Hello there.
[2:39:35] Zuldak: yep it sheeths upside down
[2:39:54] Papavodo: if you have a pack on you wont see it on your back
[2:40:07] jeffdmk: breaking news video game does not follow irl physics
[2:40:07] eielwind: I’ve always heard freehold raw gold farm is good too
[2:40:07] Papavodo: Yes
[2:40:17] Zuldak: yeah you're slapping em with the fire
[2:40:29] Papavodo: when attacking with the torch yuo go full villager attacking the monster
[2:40:35] witchhobbit: yeah with weapons like that i just use the backpacks or whatever lol
[2:40:40] Zuldak: but my fury warrior now has the candelstick thing. Dual wielding those
[2:40:51] Zuldak: double lumiare slaps
[2:41:00] eielwind: I think it’s like 1000g per run average and if you do the 10 per hour it’s decent
[2:41:48] eielwind: pulling all the trash selling greens etc
[2:42:12] fragaden: fiddle sticks
[2:42:22] turaw_kemor: one of the races also generates more raw gold too if i remember correctly too
[2:42:22] legomanj: Hey Hazel, I have a friend who wants to try normal amirdrassil, and really loves your guides, i was just wondering if you were still planning on releasing your fyraak guide
[2:42:27] turaw_kemor: one of their racials
[2:42:31] witchhobbit: you coulddd now do murozonds
[2:42:58] fragaden: what a cute transmog on that gnome
[2:43:21] AnarchyMoose: does rise give the mount thing?
[2:43:38] witchhobbit: i love how the new shirt looks with the new tabards
[2:43:39] fragaden: "you're grinding my gears"
[2:43:46] eielwind: quantum courser gave me mechagon mount
[2:44:13] witchhobbit: the 3d parts of the excavator shirts goes over the new tabards like the chain mail tabard
[2:44:30] GreenArrowed: sooo excited for warbands too
[2:44:30] Tuk87: what would be the optimal key level to farm Rise for the Quantum item?
[2:44:53] pet_pepi_rus: you know you could do that now and just store the mogs in like alts void storage, right?
[2:45:32] eielwind: and if it doesn’t work you have to get rid of it all lol
[2:45:35] Cyberwolffe: Cyberwolffe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 52 months, currently on a 52 month streak! Hi everyone.  I'm working on a Worgen alt to do the Gilnean quests
[2:45:35] Streamlabs: cyberwolffe just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[2:45:38] Papavodo: I heard its retro if you HAVE it still so hoping the legendary bow i have on a paladin is gonna trigger
[2:45:38] InfiniFiasco: was the rogue class mount quest hard for you? why did blizzard make it so hard?
[2:45:40] Perkolate: patch comes through and you get the fun/still have the space then!
[2:46:09] fragaden: isn't that the case for vendor raid gear? if you buy the set,you cannot reselll it or otherwise you lose that appearance
[2:46:13] komolana: !addons
[2:46:13] Streamlabs: Find Hazel's addon list here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jzT8uXCI-9NyhTOO9Iof30PlxwyJn-uMLpEQ85Sd2Gc/edit#gid=0
[2:46:22] pet_pepi_rus: in that case maybe wait until beta comes out and see if it works when copying a character?
[2:46:49] witchhobbit: the hunter mount didnt look fun but couldnt tell if it was actually easy or not
[2:47:11] eielwind: how much did you customize the CD voice callouts? I took a bunch off and it still feels overwhelming sometimes
[2:47:55] InfiniFiasco: hunter one is easy at higher level but rogue one you have to sneak into other factions places and could be players and guards around
[2:48:16] briskbc: Good afternoon.
[2:48:35] fragaden: they are like "this blows"
[2:49:24] eielwind: ok so no easy way to do it really lol
[2:51:41] briskbc: What do you think of the coming feature that lets you collect transmog gear to your appearances for different classes. Like if your doing old raids on a pally and you can add cloth leather and mail boss drops.
[2:51:48] eielwind: I tend to get tired of solo shuffle after like 2 rounds lol
[2:52:25] caradosailanthus: I lost all my rounds of solo shuffle on my first attempt, didn't really enjoy it
[2:52:46] caradosailanthus: I do want to get in and get stuff though, maybe next expac
[2:53:31] fragaden: id accept taking L's at every match if i were to do Arena
[2:53:44] eielwind: I want the mount so that makes me sad when I lose more than 3 and then I get mad at myself lol
[2:53:53] witchhobbit: what was s1?
[2:54:01] caradosailanthus: Yeah I've never gotten a vicious mount and I'd like to get at least one
[2:54:35] Veedellmuffin: same I've never gotten a vicious mount
[2:54:45] caradosailanthus: They are very FOMO since you can't even farm them at tiny chance in later xpacs
[2:55:07] eielwind: you can fill the bar twice and get a saddle @caradosailanthus
[2:55:17] maachen: Have a great day, Hazel & chat!
[2:55:24] eielwind: as many times as you want really
[2:55:34] Veedellmuffin: I get frustrated and give up
[2:55:36] MrSonicgen: Gonna go. Bye.
[2:55:40] Blueofthenightfall: i LOVE the season 1 dragonflight its the only pvp mount i got lol
[2:55:41] fragaden: "cat" mount. wish it was simply named that
[2:56:16] caradosailanthus: @eielwind Oh I didn't know that
[2:56:24] fragaden: toodles @MrSonicgen
[2:56:32] AnarchyMoose: getting a saddle is a HUGE commitment tho
[2:56:34] eielwind: lots of grinding to get multiple saddles though lol
[2:58:18] caradosailanthus: I main feral druid though, and am terrible at pvping on it
[2:58:22] eielwind: do you know how much % you get per rbg win?
[2:58:31] fragaden: woo
[2:58:57] Arabany: it is not a lot
[2:59:01] eielwind: I kind of want to just get a bunch of alts to 1000 rating and farm wins at that low rating lol
[2:59:15] DarthChewbaccaa: id love to try and farm some saddles but im just trash at pvp period
[2:59:44] Arabany: I do not know about nowdays, but in SL an rpg was like 2-3% if you win.
[2:59:53] Arabany: * an rbg
[3:00:34] witchhobbit: yeah thats a lot of marks thats nice
[3:00:45] witchhobbit: i love being able to buy a whole set
[3:01:36] Eirchi: Do you ever use your old mounts in Dragon Isles just to fly hands off?
[3:02:23] Aseopp: Byeee!
[3:02:27] Eirchi: Bye Hazel! Seacrest out!
[3:02:32] Uchiha_Cloaky: Can u link me ur armory?
