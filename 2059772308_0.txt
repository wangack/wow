[2:53:27] chum1y: @Lmgd1 i remember a few weeks ago we got into an argument about the high refresh monitors and i told you they couldn't even perform because of frame time vs latency.  Gamers nexus just did a huge article about this and will be testing components thru the entire pipeline from mouse to screen input now.  it'll be interesting to see which ones the performers actually are.
[2:54:52] chum1y: like they're saudering wires into the mice and contacting them to the screen
[2:54:56] Valraven_: @Lmgd1 hey bro, whats the best spec for 25-40 as shammy for lvling ?
[2:55:18] chum1y: to see which has the lowest real input delay and frame time.
[2:56:25] chum1y: to be honest only tft central has ever done any sort of real monitor testing
[2:56:44] psykfall69: Boris go WSG right now

[3:08:10] wethetv: when you log in
[3:09:19] ricktasty_tv_: any1 who can tell me name of the shield he had on shaman
[3:10:30] watercaltrop: bbbbbbboris
[3:11:20] wethetv: hows 40s shaman looking like lmgd
[3:11:27] wethetv: I'm asking since I think I wont resub again to wow
[3:13:05] wethetv: would you guys be able to summon him into your layer?
[3:15:05] wethetv: you personally sound pretty deflated atm
[3:15:39] lateloll: @wethetv if ur looking for something fresh i dont think you should sub :D its a mix of wotlk and classic, its the same shit in a different box
[3:15:54] wethetv: I had fun in phase1
[3:15:58] wethetv: but it got so drawn out
[3:16:28] wethetv: and I think, like at this point it doesn't matter what blizzard puts up I will just not play tbh
[3:16:39] huzzleqt: ele is a meme in raids and dungeons?
[3:16:55] chum1y: yeah im kinda done with blizz games @wethetv
[3:16:55] gussgus18: just link stuff plz ?
[3:17:16] chum1y: it's like the hollowed out shell of a hollowed out shell that used to be blizzard
[3:17:21] lateloll: @wethetv yea, i found myself   stuck playing the game :D wasnt really 100% enjoying it anymore, just nothing better to play, glad im off it aswell
[3:17:46] wethetv: very nice game all
[3:17:58] lateloll: @wethetv i only watch some streamers anymore
[3:18:28] chum1y: @lateloll yeah i can just watch streamers play SoD
[3:18:30] wethetv: ye @lateloll that's what it come to for me also and it's only moo and lmgd pretty much
[3:19:09] chum1y: i had more fun playing palworld than i have playing any blizzard game lately.
[3:19:35] wethetv: so what is this event even
[3:19:40] wethetv: is it a free for all fuckfest?
[3:19:56] wethetv: alkXD
[3:20:05] wethetv: man this is a good game
[3:20:10] chum1y: KEKW
[3:20:37] chum1y: its microsoft now LUL
[3:20:56] chum1y: blizzard got fired
[3:21:31] wethetv: this is a case of cloud servers just not able to keep up
[3:21:35] chum1y: the FCC in the states it pissed because MSFT apparently broke a ton of the good faith agreements when they let got of 1900 people
[3:22:34] wethetv: 1900 ex blizzard trouble employees?
[3:22:39] chum1y: so they essentially agreed not to do stuff like that and inflate their stock prices after they acquired as part of the deal, because they're worryied about antitrust stuff.  and microsoft went and did it anyways.
[3:22:42] wethetv: or just normal good employees
[3:23:06] chum1y: they just shitcanned a bunch of people to make their stock go up short term
[3:23:15] chum1y: and killed all the new IP
[3:23:24] chum1y: like the new open world survival game... shitcanned.,
[3:23:35] wethetv: I will be honest
[3:23:49] wethetv: I don't think blizzard will be able to compete with other survival games
[3:23:58] wethetv: like, is it planning on beating EFT?
[3:24:01] chum1y: all the promises they made about not gutting the company were all lies too
[3:24:01] wethetv: Rust?
[3:24:08] chum1y: they're prob gonna get a $200k fine
[3:24:15] totti_3k4: can you kill the world boss?
[3:24:15] wethetv: who cares tbh
[3:24:22] wethetv: blizzard was a husk anyways
[3:24:29] wethetv: there hasn't been any soul in it for so long
[3:24:38] chum1y: yeah it really is just a dead insect corpse at this point that looks like the animal still
[3:25:05] chum1y: like when cicada shed and it looks like the bug but u pick it up and it turns into dust.
[3:25:06] swagmandalorian: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:25:11] wethetv: ye
[3:25:22] lateloll: i started playing shooters a few years ago after i got bored of wow, took me a while to catch up to people  playing for ages :D
[3:25:55] wethetv: I hope after they hollow out blizzard, keep the golden nuggets
[3:25:58] wethetv: the games can get proper love
[3:26:04] chum1y: u mean the turds LUL
[3:26:13] wethetv: surely there is someone worth something
[3:26:17] lateloll: i hope riot really slam dunks with the mmo plans
[3:26:20] rothwall1: !server
[3:26:20] StreamElements: SOD: Living Flame EU | HC: Defias Pillager NA | Wrath: Gehennas Horde EU
[3:26:43] lateloll: riot has so much potential, they got the money, they got the experience
[3:26:54] wethetv: man these servers so good yes
[3:27:05] wethetv: this actually reminds me of 2003 BG experience
[3:27:14] chum1y: i really hope the fact that pocketpair made a AAA game on a 6.7M budget is a kick in the teeth for all these shitter AAA companies putting out billion dollar garbage.
[3:27:32] chum1y: diablo 4 budget = garbage game.
[3:27:52] wethetv: @chum1y spraying gold flakes on a steamy pile of shit and calling it chocolate.
[3:28:48] chum1y: i heard pockepair is already making a new game, hiring a bunch of new peoplpe for new IP when they have the best performing game on the market right now.  seem like chad move.
[3:29:22] chum1y: if they've figured out how to cut huge dev costs and produce quality game with no cash shop im down tf.
[3:29:34] wethetv: palworld is the perfect example of new fresh talent coming to the scene
[3:29:40] chum1y: exactly
[3:29:44] chum1y: the game is fun af.
[3:29:51] wethetv: and no relics that is shareholders
[3:29:58] wethetv: that is forcing down micro, cash shop
[3:30:00] chum1y: nobody to answer to.
[3:30:09] wethetv: That's why the production is so cheap
[3:30:15] chum1y: they want more money?  they make another game.  chads.
[3:30:16] wethetv: there's less control and channels to go thro
[3:30:50] 03logos: DinoDance TwitchConHYPE
[3:31:02] wethetv: AAA studios has lead designers that scrap great ideas or designs because they personally think it doesn't fit or whatever and the artist goes back to do more
[3:31:05] chum1y: JAMMIES
[3:31:26] wethetv: always fit a narrative
[3:31:32] chum1y: @wethetv AAA shareholder value makers don't make good games.  imagine that.
[3:31:58] chum1y: battlepass!  cash shop!  cosmetics!  3rd party gold sellers!
[3:32:02] wethetv: the only good game I've enjoyed lately is pathfinder from owlcat
[3:32:08] chum1y: yeah fuck all that.
[3:32:10] wethetv: and that's an ultra tiny russian game studio
[3:32:28] wethetv: you don't need 200 people to produce games
[3:32:48] chum1y: pocketpair did it with 30 i think.
[3:33:05] chum1y: they hired like 50 artists for new game after palworld popped off though.
[3:33:20] wethetv: that's essentially a new department though
[3:33:37] chum1y: they said most of their costs are for art department now
[3:33:57] wethetv: this is fucking 2003 pvp
[3:34:03] wethetv: alkXD
[3:34:20] wethetv: you couldn't even loot the first few days
[3:34:25] wethetv: since it would lag so much
[3:35:33] chum1y: dude.  i remember how good eternal nightmares was on Nost and how good the pvp and lag was.  and this live game service sucks ass by comparison
[3:35:46] wethetv: it's cloud servers
[3:36:08] wethetv: if each server had a dedicated shard pc like back in the day
[3:36:11] wethetv: it wouldn't be this bad
[3:36:13] HERMITcapital: i was born in 2006 lmo

[13:43:06] kozlia: does anc guidance healing proc on self
[13:43:17] bronchoped1: @diperna9 because starsurge is a low mana, high range, instant cast spell that does more damage than 6 second cast pyroblast

[13:43:45] themightyjunek: pvp duels in wow KEKW
[13:43:51] yung_gab_: Maybe reduce range for 20y base would balance it a bit in pvp

[13:44:10] yung_gab_: And 20% redc in dmg
[13:44:15] peeweeherman69: starsurge needs a straight up 50% nerf shit is busted same with sps

[13:44:48] yung_gab_: It also needs to cost 10% of own hp
[13:44:59] kozlia: yh but ur also healing urself at the same time instead of casting

[14:36:25] htvizzle: (for me)
[14:36:55] FelCodex: I hope they buff power surge to have higher proc chance
[14:37:21] hiraethonhs: shamans coulda outlast balance cause surge wasnt so retarded in p1
[14:37:27] hiraethonhs: now it's too broken

[14:37:39] htvizzle: 100% to 0
[14:37:55] eXTreMe1337: they should add more range to flameshock with lavaburst rune

[14:44:12] htvizzle: 1% hit
[14:44:49] SwordShot: can I see talents real quick???
[14:45:00] htvizzle: "target ally" instead of just "target" i think means cant use of self (maybe im wrong)
