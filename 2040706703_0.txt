[0:33:58] Squats3: no shot ben is playing again
[0:34:00] bluetheoffical: hihi
[0:34:15] allisonkielle: ret buffs ftw
[0:34:18] StanRaenslen: poe tribalism = reason
[0:34:19] Jazzarus_: @Jazzarus_ I've been checking the rotation in videos and wowhead, I think I use too much rising sun kick, I mean, I do some damage, but I saw another monk with similar gear outdpsing me
[0:34:21] xhriiis: d4 bad is the lore
[0:34:24] Squats3: oh d4
[0:34:25] Bigwes46: Can you give us the low down on the new changes? for S3?
[0:34:26] GrimmshadoXI: What a story. Wild stuff
[0:34:26] Squats3: yea yea
[0:34:26] kaelas06: d4 bad is the only lore
[0:34:31] Squats3: next season looks good. ima do hardcore
[0:34:37] shareandcare: max have you ever invited a guy to trial for the guild you met in a random m+?
[0:34:41] Squats3: i thought chat was talking about wow
[0:35:02] sorliee: They buffed ret not fury KEKW
[0:35:02] LionButLeon: Kappa
[0:35:04] kaelas06: Kappa
[0:35:06] mycho_: Kappa
[0:35:06] d0mezg4mer: his chat is just big on the d4 bad meme, people probably assumed that means ben hates it too
[0:35:11] Ehsanfury: Clueless
[0:35:13] LionButLeon: Ele atm: ???
[0:35:15] Nickystr1x: max have you ever invited a random guy to trial you met at a strip club?
[0:35:18] nightst314: Fury is doing well, especially on AoE
[0:35:24] Richadin: they for sure waited until tiersets were picked/
[0:35:27] Dengara: Ele Buffs went to REsto Kappa
[0:35:27] Jarlan23: they need to be quicker on these tuning passes
[0:35:31] JQ47: @maximum just saw riot is laying off 11% of staff
[0:35:33] larkhill: cant monitor fury feedback of no one plays the spec
[0:35:41] Squats3: fury has decent damage. their damage profile is just really awful
[0:35:46] turnipstampede: Kappa
[0:35:48] Troniin: Ret stonks looking up
[0:35:54] herptyderptyqwerty: i thought fury was one of the most popular specs
[0:35:55] deadlygalaxy534: @nightst314 out of cds its a dogshit spec
[0:36:08] Basic_3: Are we really going to go to WW with some classes being full 2-talent cleave monsters and Ret Paladin/etc still existing as-is?
[0:36:27] heziden: @Troniin not really, WoA wasnt our prob
[0:36:36] mangotangodown66: mangotangodown66 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:36:36] Syzmical: theyll get 1 more key level before the one shot
[0:36:48] draconisraccoonis: Dorki said is was nothing
[0:36:49] Benjg7: 1.5% phys dr
[0:36:50] thecajuncommie: too small, can’t read the words
[0:36:54] puneet911: basically nothing
[0:36:54] Lothland: 3 devs can do an entire mini season but 1 single dev can't fix obvious issues in current season.."too busy"
[0:37:02] larkhill: our bdk says <2%
[0:37:04] LionButLeon: Wokege BIG
[0:37:09] ArcaneSyntax: Rise of the ret meta
[0:37:11] leubinator: yuge
[0:37:13] BickenBone: Size MATTERS
[0:37:29] Durenas: bottom ish
[0:37:42] PuzzleMonkey: The typical frost buff every season
[0:37:45] LionButLeon: Ele Aware
[0:38:04] Dengara: Resto shaman is gonna start doing more than Ele soon
[0:38:16] LionButLeon: @Dengara oh for sure KEKW
[0:38:19] puneet911: breath gets 100% uptime and weird chill streak uptime
[0:38:19] sevj__: 100% uptime on chill streak for frost
[0:38:21] Zevros01: its because of the tset
[0:38:26] Zevros01: the travel time
[0:38:30] SicariusGTV: obliterate build is coming in hot
[0:38:31] Archmage_Michael: look how the messed up Havoc. just middle of the pack like usual
[0:38:43] TotallyNotillu: Shadow and ret paladin are clear winner
[0:38:45] sevj__: yup, the distance from volc made it almost permanent
[0:38:55] Nickystr1x: the travel time on volcoross?
[0:38:58] puneet911: the travel distance takes years so it stays there forever and perma 20% dps buff
[0:39:00] Nickystr1x: maybe does somethin
[0:39:08] Zevros01: the tset buff is perma
[0:39:11] eliteasr1: @Maximum Watch replay of any frost dk on that boss
[0:39:12] tuurdfergusn: breath uptime
[0:39:13] Ebonhawke7: travel time on volcoross is so weird
[0:39:28] sevj__: every tiime it bounce, it refresh, since volcoross hitbox is special, it take 2-3 sec to bounce
[0:39:34] 240_afk: sub rogue being 6.5% higher than the #2 DPS makes no sense at this point
[0:39:37] Keppie__: thats why frost mage and arcane hate that fight because some of their spells take forever to hit
[0:39:39] tuurdfergusn: extra runes and cdr
[0:39:43] panser_nes: oh no
[0:39:50] herptyderptyqwerty: ain't no one doing that
[0:39:57] Durenas: i think nymue would be a better metric
[0:40:01] LionButLeon: xdd
[0:40:04] panser_nes: no definitely no one is doing that monkaW
[0:40:05] Fleymour: remove 10.2.5 filter ? @Maximum
[0:40:07] The_origin: HeyGuys
[0:40:10] Fleymour: for video
[0:40:21] ArcaneSyntax: Everyone playing frost is too embarrassed to upload that shit to YouTube
[0:40:47] xrandomdoodx: Ele being only very good on council is making it look better than it really is Sadge
[0:40:49] LionButLeon: Hmmge
[0:40:54] ahri_feet_connoisseur: 😳 WutFace
[0:41:06] custom025: would u have brought WW as it is now to fyrakk on RWF?
[0:41:28] sorliee: xdd
[0:41:34] ottermatic69: only 1 lock spec is even on this chart
[0:41:38] Madgeneto: feral?
[0:41:38] StanRaenslen: i think he just looking at ww being #3 on this chart
[0:41:38] eggs_boiled: the augs xdd
[0:41:42] reggiepowa: brew xdd
[0:41:46] slappygilmore_: @Madgeneto no motw then
[0:41:46] custom025: Frick aug
[0:41:51] miniath_: the strictness of raid comps is as bad as its ever been this tier
[0:41:54] Durenas: haha no you need those augs
[0:41:56] Madgeneto: @Madgeneto yea i mean swap the roles ofc
[0:41:58] LionButLeon: @madgeneto cant sit feral cuz of vers buff
[0:42:03] Hansiii2911: sit 1 rogue?
[0:42:08] yukidamonk: 1 enh?
[0:42:09] srs_business: second enh?
[0:42:10] larkhill: is the 2nd enhance the only option to sit?
[0:42:10] LionButLeon: Wokege
[0:42:15] Basic_3: @ottermatic69 Only 1 Lock spec in the game
[0:42:17] Dcss97: bro the way rogue was there
[0:42:18] custom025: But fr tho enhance?
[0:42:21] Pyro_Cricket: BM hunter?
[0:42:25] Madgeneto: -50% damage xdd
[0:42:25] Dcss97: no way you sit one rogue
[0:42:26] Oracle_WoW: 1 tank it
[0:42:31] silence4tww: if you have imexile and jpc you never sit a rg
[0:42:40] Rafix1301: Yo is unholy saved?
[0:42:41] Deece_: i dont think ppl understand how valuable the massive burst dmg rogue does is insane
[0:42:42] Bigwes46: Can you show boss dam?
[0:42:48] Sekrai: Only time WW sees play is when it's broken or MW and Brew are gigabad
[0:42:48] eggs_boiled: windfury for the pesky rogues xdd
[0:42:49] GuilherMELHOR: @Maximum is assa the best rogue spec for prog??
[0:42:53] Kinghorn: garf
[0:42:57] mrcreatine123: THE FERAL
[0:43:06] Byggareebob: was? they're still broken XD
[0:43:14] Jazzarus_: LUL
[0:43:15] miniath_: it would inarguably be a raid buff class if raid buffs didnt exist
[0:43:24] xhriiis: losing mark on the raid and the adds LUL good joke
[0:43:30] Madgeneto: what role did you bring a monk on? bring a druid as that?
[0:43:37] slappygilmore_: only like 2-3% in ST
[0:43:41] slappygilmore_: bigger in M+
[0:43:42] kevdeckie: primal wrath in M+ is so key
[0:43:44] eggs_boiled: @Madgeneto mistwaever
[0:43:45] Spellb00k: rip natures vigil as well
[0:43:46] fronkacean: @spro___ ye they def arent astro gapping on ST already LMAO
[0:43:48] sorliee: The ret buff xdd while all other plate wearers gets almost nothing xdd
[0:43:56] Basic_3: @Madgeneto During prog you needed Mistweaver for Revival on Fyrakk. Also MW is just insane.
[0:43:58] xhriiis: @madgeneto impossible revival was mandatory
[0:44:13] bluetheoffical: you guys hating on ret buffs but  just look at logs , paladins are terrible
[0:44:15] slappygilmore_: @spro___ let us be good :(
[0:44:15] kevdeckie: Primal wrath and rip damage in M+ is huge
[0:44:22] Basic_3: Like Fire Mage?
[0:44:22] Durenas: i do like that they're buffing individual spells, it shows that they're thinking about how specs are actually played in different content and not just an aura buff
[0:44:28] srs_business: Shadowlands Surv
[0:44:42] EppatTV: Mistweaver
[0:44:44] kevdeckie: squishy melee spec also
[0:44:54] MrChaCho: also the Survival Tree is beans
[0:44:57] noewon: MW this season is very good
[0:44:58] kevdeckie: survival
[0:44:59] sorliee: @bluetheoffical But they buffed their AoE aswell, if it was about raid logs why not hit ST for most part, their m+ is good
[0:45:00] potatofarmer: i want to try feral on my druid alt but it always seems insane with everything going on haha
[0:45:01] illusion1990: I am a boomie and I am playing feral for Tindril
[0:45:16] miniath_: does anybody actually enjoy being in the raid solely because a raid buff?
[0:45:22] JaeDaddaa: MM hunter needs buffas
[0:45:23] gretriku: as an old school feral parser it must've felt particularly nice for you to finally be able to bring a feral to the race (meant as a compliment)
[0:45:26] bluetheoffical: @bluetheoffical woa was not even our problem and they buffed it
[0:45:41] MeisterChiefX: 4% is pretty substantial for SV when you factor in that BM is propped up by PI on stats
[0:45:41] 240_afk: sub rogue needs a nerf
[0:45:49] mk__9: Im sure chat is full of survival experts
[0:45:53] Byggareebob: why would you not play BM xd
[0:45:58] JaeDaddaa: oh look MM worst ST and we're bugged on volc
[0:46:02] JaeDaddaa: Feelsgreatman
[0:46:10] MeisterChiefX: 3.5% ish
[0:46:14] Camelbak21: They
[0:46:21] Camelbak21: They're also melee
[0:46:22] purplejesusss: that's 95% of mythic fyrrak lmao. isn'tthat like 200 people
[0:46:24] daiger5o: How is mm lower than aug lmao
[0:46:24] JansonLives: buff sub.
[0:46:34] StanRaenslen: so survival > bm
[0:46:35] TheLuo: Tfw when you get an ad
[0:46:43] TheLuo: TheLuo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:46:45] eggs_boiled: @240_afk sub rogues is insane because it can benefit so much from externals, simply a windfury totem for sub is like 13k dmg
[0:46:49] JaeDaddaa: @daiger5o we're bugged on that fight and even without the bug we're still lowest dps
[0:46:58] Madgeneto: (delete aug)
[0:47:13] leubinator: aren't most survivals in this percentile onetricks tho
[0:47:19] Durenas: and holy damage is lol

[0:47:25] 240_afk: SV hunter going to pump
[0:47:25] sprakk: Survival has no cooldowns. They're flatter than my ex
[0:47:27] TheLuo: 2min
[0:47:27] MeisterChiefX: they do but its scuffed
[0:47:27] Jazzarus_: 2 min coordinated ass
[0:47:28] Madgeneto: 2min i think
[0:47:30] ninemoreminutes: I feel like the not good players thing might not be true in the suvival case, prob one tricks who own at surv mostly
[0:47:33] Camelbak21: They basically don't really have good cds
[0:47:39] Squats3: thats not even true
[0:47:42] DevQT32: DevQT32 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[0:47:43] Squats3: it has a 2 min
[0:47:45] Kobaaya: SV pe is dogshit
[0:47:45] LionButLeon: Ele Aware
[0:47:46] StanRaenslen: their 45s slaps
[0:47:47] mopgoesham: why is augmentation so low?
[0:47:51] Kobaaya: pve*
[0:47:51] TheLuo: SV has a no CD build - but it's big CD is 2min
[0:47:54] sprakk: @Squats3 KEKW CA?
[0:47:55] Madgeneto: it does have cd but it has cd less builds i t hink
[0:48:01] TheLuo: they have a baby cd at 45sec but it's meh
[0:48:01] totemic_: it has a 2 min and 1.5 min cooldown and both are good
[0:48:04] Squats3: @Squats3 fuck yeah! its pretty shit!
[0:48:05] CoffeeASAP: Yeah I run the no CD build
[0:48:07] Squats3: but it is a CD
[0:48:07] Joneim: @mopgoesham Aug is very weak so it needs buffs bad :)
[0:48:11] eggs_boiled: sub rogues is pissing on the competition
[0:48:33] Byggareebob: sub rogue is already playing war within
[0:48:36] MeisterChiefX: there are unironically like 5 SV hunters who can do good damage on logs
[0:48:40] JakeParkbench: Are we not looking at ,mythic raids anyways, its not like its bottom skill players
[0:48:44] sprakk: @Squats3 A twig on the road would cause more of a bump than CA
[0:49:11] eggs_boiled: i think a windwalker smokes a survival 10 times out of 10
[0:49:15] Caseman984: 20 years of frost mage baby
[0:49:24] Ilue_: pug fire mages TrollDespair
[0:49:28] mopgoesham: @mopgoesham I can tell you're joking hehe but im new. is warcraft logs just bad at telling how much dps theyre outputting?
[0:49:31] JFUNKGAMING: GIGACHAD
[0:49:32] Rebizle: that's me :)
[0:49:36] mopgoesham: or are they actually not doing much

[0:49:54] R0NGG: Im gapping everyone Kappa
[0:50:13] SamyO93: Holy pal is ass :(
[0:50:14] Lothland: yeah thats the problem with holy...yup...
[0:50:15] ramentashen: since when did frost dk become good
[0:50:19] eggs_boiled: when i pug on aug, im afk half the fight, im gapping them on the astral plane
[0:50:20] JFUNKGAMING: healer changes Bedge
[0:50:23] unibeast798: @R0NGG surely
[0:50:24] Land_ZGZ: Poor Driney
[0:50:25] LionButLeon: ret eats goodf
[0:50:26] ciggyman: DRINESTER NOOOOO
[0:50:29] Durenas: ret buffs add up to ~5% single target and ~2-4% aoe depending on the situation.
[0:50:33] Atrosity: alright chat i haven't played in three months because i had a baby, what class is good after all this
[0:50:35] ninemoreminutes: no shot this ret stuff was warranted
[0:50:37] colt149: mega aoe buff
[0:50:39] fronkacean: that class needed a buff too
[0:50:42] Orthobullet: MOAR
[0:50:49] Flipeled: yup
[0:50:53] Zarroe: fury TrollDespair
[0:50:55] Rafix1301: ye
[0:50:55] Fleymour: no
[0:50:56] SamyO93: Simulation suggests a ~5.2% buff to single-target in the pure ST build / on the BiS profile. Assuming no talent changes, ~4.9% buff to ST in BiS profile in a typical M+ build.
[0:50:56] DaBearGaming: not fury
[0:50:57] leubinator: not fury tho KEKW
[0:50:58] purplejesusss: not fury bro

[0:51:00] MeisterChiefX: all but fury
[0:51:02] marcosaraujo96: Except fury
[0:51:02] m33shochque: but no buffs to fury
[0:51:02] Fleymour: only arms aoe
[0:51:04] EppatTV: Not fury KEKW
[0:51:04] Flipeled: except futy
[0:51:07] KeVForSure: Fury misses out
[0:51:08] Troniin: ret is not great in raid though
[0:51:11] exzhero: yo max tell blizzard to let ret have final reck and execution sentence again
[0:51:15] LionButLeon: ALOO

[0:51:22] Lluksobad: Lluksobad subscribed with Prime. 
[0:51:22] caveman2x: Fury Aware
[0:51:23] 240_afk: outside of fury, the buffed all lego classes because blizzard is stupid and tuned all those classes around the lego which a lot cannot get to drop
[0:51:24] TheLuo: ret is thicc come tuesday
[0:51:31] Caseman984: how do you think he answers the phone

[0:51:43] Keppie__: 1 what?
[0:51:43] enjoii_: Will SP be good/viable come reset please chat? :)
[0:51:44] Durenas: i'm not convinced that's the reason behind these buffs, 240_afk
[0:51:53] marvinsbestfriend: @Caseman984 hes a yellow! kinda guy for sure
[0:52:20] Kinghorn: garf 󠀀
[0:52:21] love4juju: the classes were tuned to get the Lego. but the lego seems elusive for many full time raiders.
[0:52:25] eggs_boiled: @enjoii_ prob not, but shadow might just get another rework before s4, so invest now when stonks are low
[0:52:26] Awsum18: @marvinsbestfriend lmfao
[0:52:33] thePaNlC: @Troniin so is arms, even worse then ter,but the arms buff is laughable compared to ret
[0:52:42] LionButLeon: GIGACHAIR

[0:53:16] Durenas: another week another no axe... tomorrow is when things turn around! 🤡
[0:53:20] 240_afk: yeah, fury should've gotten like +1% or something to keep them in line with all these changes going through
[0:53:32] Madgeneto: @enjoii_ uh yes, it was already good/viable before this buff, not it's competing for top ranged again, A tier if not S
[0:53:33] love4juju: doggo stream
[0:53:43] Madgeneto: now*
[0:53:46] guynormally: dorki did the math when the tunings first dropped, and none of them are as big as they seem
[0:53:55] Durenas: fury does alright in certain situations. they do need buffs though
[0:54:09] gretriku: @Durenas excatly what ive told myself for 3 weeks in a row now COPIUM
[0:54:17] Durenas: same
[0:55:11] gretriku: is there any chance they roll the legendary bad luck protection over to season 4 for anyone that hasnt gotten it by then?
[0:55:28] Zarroe: it'd be wild if they reset blp xdd
[0:55:29] ShadowDuelist21: COPIUM my fury brothers

[0:55:49] SlowboLaggins: @Durenas yeah m+ and fyrakk KEKW
[0:56:01] Byggareebob: its really simple actually. if you dont have the lego you need the buff bad. if you have the lego u dont need this buff at all
[0:56:09] TheLuo: So was the phone cookin?
[0:56:12] midiansgod: Good evening @Maximum and good evening everyone :)
[0:56:20] sukoWoW: instead of buffing legendary-wielding classes, what if they just buffed the legendary?
[0:56:28] goombacci: ret was fine ya
[0:56:31] Kinghorn: lsrHowdy midiansgod
[0:56:32] bluetheoffical: look at logs for ret
[0:56:33] midiansgod: I can't wait to get this ret buff lol
[0:56:33] Madgeneto: was it the police investigating your meme smuggling?
[0:56:41] KUDVIN_DI: solo target stinks
[0:56:46] KaisenSiru: Ret Pog
[0:56:47] JansonLives: ret ST is ass in M+
[0:57:07] gretriku: @sukoWoW they have been. but buffing it doesnt help everyone who plays a legendary class but cant get it to drop
[0:57:08] Durenas: wake is a 30 second cooldown
[0:57:13] RaeRizzle: Ret can only do AOE or Single target. They cant do both
[0:57:13] Squats3: not a single thing says it doesnt effect pvp. nice
[0:57:13] leubinator: rets top dmg in atal is saurids KEKW
[0:57:13] larkhill: ret is king of the 20's
[0:57:28] Troniin: Ret only plays single target in raid
[0:57:38] bazefacee: its cause ST
[0:57:39] Darklott: doesnt buffing their aoe technically to a degree buff st as well since they have to take aoe talents for m+
[0:57:41] midiansgod: @Troniin Exactly
[0:57:44] bazefacee: thats literaly it
[0:57:47] TheLuo: @Troniin Tindral would like a word.
[0:58:01] JamaBear: ST sucks inm+ and skilling for it is trash in m+
[0:58:04] Byggareebob: if you play aoe on tindral as ret ur griefing ur guild
[0:58:08] guynormally: no
[0:58:08] Durenas: no
[0:58:10] Byggareebob: but ur allowed to do that
[0:58:15] guynormally: st too stinky
[0:58:18] HeWhoMustNotBeSeen: We are the only spec to lose 20% ST to go AoE, That is why
[0:58:20] leubinator: no way
[0:58:22] Dowson91: Its kinda insane Paladins were like the buffbot class have basically no buffs
[0:58:36] nellkee: @HeWhoMustNotBeSeen kinda same for arms
[0:58:39] guynormally: boomy st is great tho, have you watched a dorki stream lately?
[0:58:39] Durenas: rets mostly run with ret aura anyway in most key levels
[0:58:48] Virelo: cant sacrifice teamates for wings in m+ xD
[0:59:05] xxMaverick: or can u
[0:59:10] bazefacee: so does fury
[0:59:11] xxMaverick: monkaHmm
[0:59:13] leubinator: ret destroys shitter mobs and does tank dmg to big mobs
[0:59:16] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite
[0:59:22] Madgeneto: @HeWhoMustNotBeSeen go less aoe? xdd
[0:59:22] Durenas: don't tell me what i can't do @virelo XD
[0:59:28] ottermatic69: everbloom
[0:59:30] MisterNioce: A RET PALADIN
[0:59:30] Virelo: Deadge
[0:59:34] surferkitty: flamestrike xd
[0:59:37] fat_european0: frost mage is useless aoe pad
[0:59:37] chubxd: chubxd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:59:42] ciggyman: aoe tod is fuckin dumb
[0:59:44] Dhizzy74: demo warlock and monk imo, big pad classes
[0:59:45] EppatTV: Flamestrike KEKW
[0:59:49] Virelo: ret aoe is pretty insane tho
[0:59:50] guynormally: frost mage kinda beans
[0:59:52] gretriku: aoe ToD is peak pad damage
[0:59:52] RoVcoVeR: ToD is nice on sang copium
[0:59:52] vepsee: aoe TOD is a dopamine enhancer
[0:59:53] Virelo: on non tyrannical weeks ret bangs
[0:59:54] bazefacee: a pug fire mage is the biggest bait
[0:59:54] bbrole: divine storm
[0:59:54] xrandomdoodx: poor ele shaman dodging buffs because of council parses lol
[0:59:54] Hitkoxd: you can play arround aoe tod pulling trash into boss
[0:59:55] vepsee: GIGACHAD
[0:59:57] shareandcare: aoe tod on bursting weeks, we love it
[1:00:00] larkhill: if ret had an aoe cc, theyd be brought more
[1:00:01] MrChaCho: Bring back old ToD
[1:00:02] Pyrrha_GG: rets only prio damage is just there generator rotation
[1:00:06] Durenas: it's a 30 second cooldown though
[1:00:07] Madgeneto: augs with high score that dont really do shit is the biggest bait xdd
[1:00:07] Virelo: idk final verdict is pretty big
[1:00:07] Ahrmanhamma: That's 5% in sims
[1:00:09] Veilzy__: 5
[1:00:09] Byggareebob: 5.2
[1:00:10] Ahrmanhamma: apparently
[1:00:10] Ciaphasrep: 5% ST
[1:00:10] bluetheoffical: less than 50
[1:00:10] Totemkatsu: not much
[1:00:11] Goats48: 5%
[1:00:11] MHMabrito: 5%~
[1:00:11] KaisenSiru: around 5.5% ST
[1:00:12] Pyrrha_GG: ~5%
[1:00:12] bluetheoffical: less than 5%
[1:00:12] alexlaprise: 4% or osmething
[1:00:13] Orthobullet: i read 5% or close to it
[1:00:13] bazefacee: 5 percent
[1:00:16] grobb12: 5%
[1:00:16] nadgob93: 4-5% st and like same for aoe
[1:00:17] kvNOVO: 5-6% st
[1:00:24] Richthofen187: wait is final verdict not a single target ability?
[1:00:30] SilverDragon53: aoe is only 2%
[1:00:31] Byggareebob: no the aoe is lower like 3-4%
[1:00:32] Lenzoface: Pala is already crushing warrs in keys PepeHands
[1:00:33] ztraws__: ye
[1:00:35] thecajuncommie: those are AOE abilities that are used in ST though
[1:00:36] Frantzen13: aoe is lower
[1:00:36] Feverdreams_0_: it makes their ST much better in their M+ build
[1:00:37] dkoi21: the buff is for st cleave
[1:00:38] Richthofen187: idk anything about ret
[1:00:39] KaisenSiru: talent yes
[1:00:40] Totemkatsu: st spender
[1:00:41] Pyrrha_GG: talent we always take
[1:00:44] toallcameone: FV is the ST spender
[1:00:44] Virelo: yea blade of justice is big dmg in single target
[1:00:45] midiansgod: yes
[1:00:45] fat_european0: Yes it replaces templar's verdict
[1:00:46] Pyrrha_GG: even in M+
[1:00:49] Ciaphasrep: final verdict is talented templar's verdict
[1:00:51] Durenas: it's a single target talent that buffs templar's verdict
[1:00:53] ArcaneSyntax: Final verdict is almost always taken in both AOE and st
[1:00:57] larkhill: you always take FV
[1:00:59] shareandcare: why did they tune ret and feral abilities in particular but gave dks and sv just 4% overall, any take on that?
[1:01:03] Veilzy__: FV is TV
[1:01:12] texas_grizzly: Templar's verdict is the ablility, final verdict is the upgraded version that's a talent.
[1:01:17] larkhill: the other option heals u and ret is already unkillable without it
[1:01:19] JaeDaddaa: MM Hunter buff MM NOW
[1:01:22] Pyrrha_GG: no
[1:01:25] Pyrrha_GG: it doesnt
[1:01:26] lumaday: FV is the improved TV
[1:01:27] KaisenSiru: Nope theyre different
[1:01:36] Durenas: JV was supposed to be the pvp talent
[1:01:38] Lenzoface: Buff warrior Madge
[1:01:43] punkyeti: Faithfather rebirth time?
[1:01:45] Pyrrha_GG: it used to be damage done
[1:01:54] thecajuncommie: JV used to be 5 holy power, and it used to be so much healing, lol
[1:01:54] Madgeneto: @Lenzoface they did. arms
[1:01:57] texas_grizzly: JV used to cost 5 HP
[1:02:01] Durenas: it used to be 100%
[1:02:02] larkhill: FV is also 20yd range which is so nice
[1:02:04] Pyrrha_GG: it used to cost 5HP and healed for damage done
[1:02:04] MrAndersen_: yea and it scaled with stun
[1:02:07] texas_grizzly: and was a huge heal with a CD
[1:02:14] toallcameone: As a ret player, I want them to go back and fix the stat issue they created with the rework. Ret went from big mastery to versa
[1:02:18] Virelo: ret paladin is kinda ranged now lol
[1:02:26] Goats48: Ret is a ranged player
[1:02:29] 240_afk: yeah...and blizzard makes arms the t-rex of wow
[1:02:33] TemnaChere: yup
[1:02:36] Durenas: yes vers/haste then vers/crit
[1:02:37] TemnaChere: Sadge
[1:02:37] Troniin: yes
[1:02:37] Mattefofan: @Maximum  yes
[1:02:40] oqqiH: yes
[1:02:40] Durenas: mastery is the worst stat
[1:02:40] larkhill: i like stacking vers though
[1:02:40] Valshaw: Yup
[1:02:41] Pyrrha_GG: verse is our second stat
[1:02:42] bluetheoffical: Yes
[1:02:44] lumaday: yes
[1:02:45] kwimb: yes
[1:02:46] toallcameone: Crit and haste are good enough right now, but it's versa
[1:02:49] aendenicus: isn’t ret haste now?
[1:02:51] Totemkatsu: so you want to be more squishy? cringe
[1:02:56] Pyrrha_GG: and mastery is in the dumpster
[1:02:56] ArcaneSyntax: They nerfed mastery because the entire kit is holy damage
[1:02:59] lumaday: Fair question
[1:03:01] ktthemage: lmao, "The Vers Curse"
[1:03:04] Virelo: its haste to a point but its always verse over everything @aendenicus
[1:03:05] Blu_ClosetGamer: nah I love vers toons. Feels nice in M+ defensively
[1:03:06] bbrole: rogue is scaling with vers and they are better than most crit/haste/mastery specs
[1:03:08] Toointro: what are solutions to the verse problem?
[1:03:10] DrQuackzalver: "well, we have to adjust *anyway* so why bother?"
[1:03:13] oqqiH: radiant decree and execution sentence use to cost holy power which was the old mastery
[1:03:13] meercatsdot: doesnt seem fair that palas get 20%+ buff and dks only 4%
[1:03:17] toallcameone: Mastery has also just been % spender damage, so glorified vers anyway
[1:03:18] Pyrrha_GG: Haste ~= vers > crit >> Mastery
[1:03:19] ottermatic69: demo lock somehow hasnt needed it
[1:03:22] neojhins: Haste vers
[1:03:35] Valshaw: I don't get why Blizzard is so afraid of Ret being a meta spec for the first time ever
[1:03:38] Pyrrha_GG: @meercatsdot 20% to a 30 second CD button
[1:03:43] fat_european0: @meercatsdot It amounts to roughly 4-5% dps gain so it's similar gains
[1:03:45] JaeDaddaa: @meercatsdot theres classes getting buffs? Laughs in ele/mm
[1:03:45] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[1:03:46] thecajuncommie: Wake of Ashes, Seething Flames, and Truths Wake are definitely are abilities, but are also just used in ST, and so buffing them makes it feel less bad when you are doing ST...and then a little bit of a buff on ST abilities. Should be a nice ST buff over all
[1:03:50] DrQuackzalver: new question for next interview
[1:03:53] Durenas: haste is very valuable. they need to buff mastery
[1:03:54] TheLuo: Feel like Ret has stacked vers for a while. They did in SL as well
[1:03:56] Neugo_Play: for haste some class classes need a full rework. Mastery is just tuning
[1:03:56] alexlaprise: mastery was nerfed after s1
[1:03:57] fat_european0: Ret scales well with haste now as well
[1:04:05] Madgeneto: wait why does it scale worse again?
[1:04:07] Fleymour: note that question for interview / dm @Maximum
[1:04:08] Leo36s: I hate the fact Vers exists as a stat at all
[1:04:12] Durenas: the reality is, except for mastery, vers, haste and crit are all super super close to each other
[1:04:12] toallcameone: Mastery just needs a rework for so many specs
[1:04:18] Vuhnylla: Vuhnylla subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 23 months of pogging.
[1:04:20] kappanostra: this current spec tree is so ass
[1:04:20] Jazzarus_: maybe they think that if every class scales with haste+mastery that's boring and want variety
[1:04:22] BukiChu: #windwalker ;c
[1:04:36] Camelbak21: It's not good
[1:04:38] ChipDota: why does vers exist at all as a stat
[1:04:39] BurtikShaun: vers is so boring too
[1:04:40] Goats48: how is passive dr bad?
[1:04:40] Hesh3: its boring
[1:04:41] MeisterChiefX: bring back multistrike
[1:04:42] Coonser: Ice cold take, because it's right
[1:04:42] fat_european0: Vers should be a pvp stat
[1:04:44] Camelbak21: Always hated vers
[1:04:44] dragonflyj0nes: i agree vers needs to go
[1:04:45] Darklott: vers being flat % increase and dr is just weird compared to how any of the others work
[1:04:47] Atreayu: I hate vers, so boring
[1:04:50] i_cassius: Arm pen
[1:04:52] dragonflyj0nes: its a stupid stat
[1:04:53] gfkoe: the defensive part of vers is nice for specs that stack it, but its weird to just stack a damage amp stat
[1:04:54] Faraday5001: fuck vers, fuck tertiaries
[1:04:55] Durenas: multistrike was basically delayed crit
[1:05:00] Madgeneto: just have 3 stats
[1:05:00] DanVicious: such a boring stat
[1:05:01] larkhill: trying to balance multistrike now would be a nightmare
[1:05:01] Pyrrha_GG: whats your take max, what is the new 4th stat in 12.0
[1:05:04] PinkTaricFTW: Multi strike is just crit
[1:05:05] FarmerFphil: arm pen waaaay worse
[1:05:05] bluetheoffical: is vers just flat % dmg increase?
[1:05:05] SilverSpik: execute stat
[1:05:06] ArcaneSyntax: Multistrike is just crit again.
[1:05:08] TheLuo: If there not a time when sacrificing haste/mastery/crit on a piece for a small % DR in high end prog?
[1:05:09] Squats3: hey. armor pen was fun
[1:05:10] Coonser: just do 3 stats
[1:05:10] Bloodfoox: just remove vers
[1:05:12] TheLuo: is*
[1:05:14] Goats48: dmg & dr in one stat is bad. got it
[1:05:17] Hesh3: gigacrit
[1:05:19] Nivi_Who: delete Vers
[1:05:19] Prime_Rage: vers such a boring stat they ever made
[1:05:20] Dowson91: Really with they'd redo gearing and stats, everything being mainstat + 2 secondaries is boring
[1:05:20] immaironman96: make vers like pvp resistance
[1:05:21] xenroku: They could split crit into crit chance and crit damage
[1:05:25] LionButLeon: multistrike aka elemental overload from ele xdd
[1:05:30] Syrjyys: @Squats3 explain how ArP works in 3 lines
[1:05:30] Bloodfoox: 3 stats is better. makes simming easier too amen
[1:05:30] srs_business: Multistrike had some cool interactions like surv Multishot
[1:05:31] Neugo_Play: twice chance for procs
[1:05:32] iBrylen: big number makes me big happy
[1:05:36] unName96: hit rating ? xdding
[1:05:36] ordained02: The problem is I feel verse is too important for keys, unless you make another accessible passive survivability stat.
[1:05:45] Orange_SM: doesnt fire want vers
[1:05:49] LionButLeon: @unName96 spriest and boomkin hit debuff again Pog
[1:05:49] fat_european0: @Maximum Do you think they'll ever cook up new secondary stats?
[1:05:51] thecajuncommie: Blizz has not been able to come up with a good 4th stat
[1:05:54] Marovia: multi is more procs for your enchants
[1:05:54] toallcameone: Also, crit has modifiers in classes to make them bigger, ie crit damage %
[1:05:56] MrChaCho: was multi strike hard to balance? I don't remember if they said why they retired it?
[1:06:04] Goats48: agreed
[1:06:09] kogin1: honestly just remove secondary stats
[1:06:19] Squats3: @Squats3 It lets your attacks bypass armor. if you get more armor pen than they have armor, it scales like mad and you do big dam
[1:06:21] Squats3: easy
[1:06:23] larkhill: theyve made new stats like demonbane and timestrike this expac. im sure they can replace vers if they wanted
[1:06:38] Camelbak21: @kogin1 hokay buddy, we want some sort of complexity out here
[1:06:48] Virelo: its multistrike lol
[1:06:49] IronboyEuw: aoe
[1:06:50] Camelbak21: It's multistrike
[1:06:50] Squats3: more dam
[1:06:51] sheffylul: its just multistrike
[1:06:52] i_cassius: strikes time
[1:06:52] Wheva: its multstrike
[1:06:52] Elliham: windfury kinda
[1:06:54] guynormally: xddShrug strikes time?
[1:06:54] vepsee: extra hit
[1:06:54] Hugosuave: its literally multistrike
[1:06:55] draisst: 10% of 10% autohit
[1:06:56] MeisterChiefX: timestrike is literally multistrike
[1:06:58] daiger5o: Just dam
[1:06:58] toallcameone: What if they made a second mastery for each class, so you could stat for mastery 1 and mastery 2
[1:06:59] argalanmg: yes
[1:06:59] PinkTaricFTW: Strikes time
[1:07:00] Freedomec: Just having 3 secondary stats would be fine imo
[1:07:02] Keppie__: Multistrike only dam tho
[1:07:04] TheLuo: Snap shots a % of your damage - target takes that damage over 3sec
[1:07:05] SilverSpik: what about replace vers with %dmg in major cd
[1:07:06] Eurybiadas: 10% chance to echo 10% of an ttacks damage
[1:07:10] kappanostra: this buff doesn't really address the fact that ret gives 30% of its damage to do ST or AoE, can't do hybrid profile, wich is terrible, this buff is only a bad way to address this problem, snowbolling the spec
[1:07:12] argalanmg: spicy multi strike
[1:07:15] Neugo_Play: @draisst it can procs on dots as well
[1:07:15] GrimmshadoXI: Not really multi strike. It's not an auto attack. It's just an extra dmg
[1:07:22] Camelbak21: What about adding CDR as a stat instead of vers
[1:07:28] Turkeypitz: overpower stat - increases all at the same rate with an increasing miss chance
[1:07:31] misfitstv1: could they not make Vers only apply to pvp and that scaling works. then make keys scale with time like you said removing the forced stat prio of vers?
[1:07:44] draisst: 10 % chance to 10 %  hit from melee i think @Maximum
[1:07:48] muse_less: snowboilin YEP
[1:07:52] larkhill: fuck it, let ret snowball into an aoe monster. just make more aoe raid fights
[1:07:55] tottodota: Why not a class stat? like a new mastery. mastery right now is for specs
[1:07:55] Squats3: We need like 5-6 more sneaky lego buffs. then the 2h classes will be good
[1:07:58] Squats3: its huge
[1:08:00] Squats3: everything
[1:08:01] LionButLeon: xdd
[1:08:03] Elliham: its back to what it was
[1:08:04] lumaday: its a bell curve
[1:08:05] ninemoreminutes: Psychic Link has gone from 15%->30%->40%->30%->25%->15%->25% and now back to 30%
[1:08:08] KaisenSiru: YEP its changed a lot
[1:08:10] Miril9: psychic link roller coaster goes on and on
[1:08:10] Wakakirri: they literally undid all our nerfs XD
[1:08:10] Squats3: ye
[1:08:12] Lara_TV_: 40 > 25 > 20 > 15 > 20 > 25 > 30
[1:08:12] Squats3: its silly
[1:08:13] dumnerd: name a number and its been that
[1:08:13] Madgeneto: they're literally reversing the nerfs xdd
[1:08:14] Lara_TV_: something like that
[1:08:17] kappanostra: misspelling, english is not my main language @Maximum
[1:08:17] sorliee: xdd
[1:08:17] LionButLeon: xdd 󠀀
[1:08:18] ZACKandATTACK: @Maximum I wish the damage in a key capped at 20s, but the HP kept scaling, so that it's about blasting and doing bigger and better pulls instead of "Can you live the 1 shots"
[1:08:18] sorliee: xdding
[1:08:19] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[1:08:23] kheim: its their «balance» spell for SP
[1:08:24] Pyrrha_GG: sounds like 30 is where it should be
[1:08:26] OG_Kawngi: it's been on a full rollercoaster
[1:08:27] Byggareebob: they dont have an AOE spender
[1:08:27] Madgeneto: YEP
[1:08:29] lumaday: Aug strikes again
[1:08:34] chefdejour82: we just cant get it right
[1:08:41] tottodota: Make a new Mastery stat for classes
[1:08:43] PublikPriest: 40 > 30 > 25 > 15 > 25 > 30
[1:08:45] Crispeke: i wonder if ret or sp has chance replacing aug in high keys
[1:08:45] toallcameone: Except for removing aug
[1:08:47] Coonser: better at tuning? Assassination rogue would like a word
[1:08:53] Fleymour: @Maximum see changelog tooltip: ***
[1:09:05] JamaBear: Devs on Shadow be like chat
[1:09:08] Keppie__: next patch they get their S2 tier back so SA and PL goes down again its an endless cycle
[1:09:10] Buff_Arcane: @PublikPriest 40% in 2 weeks Pog
[1:09:10] Durenas: @Crispeke for ret, not a chance in hell
[1:09:14] Hoflax24: Shadows damage paid for the sins of mass idspel
[1:09:14] Squats3: @Maximum i like the 20% buff to shadowy apparition. a 20% buff to nothing is still nothing
[1:09:19] surferkitty: spriest was just utility broken
[1:09:20] LionButLeon: PI YEP
[1:09:21] Leo36s: I wonder if splitting damage types into 3 or 4 categories, then associating a stat with each(% Increase) would be cool or just too convoluted
[1:09:24] xxMaverick: the dungeon pool made them op
[1:09:34] menzlo: They knew because they also nerfed MD
[1:09:36] surferkitty: they ruined both dmg and utility lol
[1:09:39] Miril9: just bring back 10.0.7 shadow for the mind sear so PL isn't as problematic
[1:09:41] Camelbak21: Not on bm hunter aoe :pogger
[1:09:46] fat_european0: I wish they'd revert the MD change and PI nerf
[1:09:47] LionButLeon: idk PI on mage slaps xdd
[1:09:47] i_cassius: Aug priest
[1:09:48] kisokos3: kisokos3 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! PopCorn
[1:09:49] slickrazor2: hows frost dk faring Clueless
[1:09:55] NaochoCheese: @slickrazor2 Sadge
[1:09:57] 240_afk: I wish they'd just remove PI from the game
[1:09:59] TAULYD: No Fury buffs L
[1:09:59] fireshar: arcane int is a bigger gain than PI for every int user xdd

[1:18:22] enigmasvea: riot mmo in shambles D:
[1:18:24] just__avery: the fighting game isnt cancelled
[1:18:24] ColdIceCreamMan: mmo and arcane are not cancelled guys.
[1:18:27] misran: god the corpospeak "refocusing on fewer, high-impact projects" is so insufferable
[1:18:33] Artheeri: Sadge Max Xyro'd us chat
[1:18:33] fzybny: Riot mmo has to be dead, mmos are a huge investment and this language doesn't sound promising
[1:18:34] alarkin: The mmo was toast the moment ghostcrawler left
[1:18:40] Dzor12: Sorry to hear @SookiePark Hope all the best for you
[1:18:42] sukoWoW: cap
[1:18:44] Durenas: the reality is, there's no good way to break this kind of news
[1:18:51] Mastodonian: (Yes it is)
[1:18:59] BigTrout3: COPIUM
[1:19:02] greenmachine11235: Lying through their teeth, 1000% money driven
[1:19:02] JakeParkbench: Tech way off hired, its really rough.
[1:19:05] LionButLeon: Kappa

[1:20:30] mathrix__: 3 years ago I went on 2 dates with a girl that worked at Riot. I hope she's okay. God I'm so lonely
[1:20:35] Reznr: being laid off fucking blows
[1:20:39] TheRealTarrjue: 6 months salary is very good
[1:20:45] Goodnevi1: Not even a call or in face, they sent an email?
[1:20:46] sukoWoW: whats Dylan's bonus this year?
[1:20:54] bergy101: didnt you guys move their for her job Aware
[1:20:57] PurpleKami: @Tombah irrelevant given the state of the industry
[1:20:59] noewon: RageyBoom only 6 months salary !
[1:21:06] d0mezg4mer: YEP
[1:21:06] LionButLeon: 5Head

[1:21:18] Tombah: which people are getting
[1:21:19] Durenas: i imagine he wrote that email knowing it would go public
[1:21:20] ThisIzD: @mathrix__ Sadge
[1:21:23] Jjmn12: these emails are all written with knowledge they will be "leaked" anyway
[1:21:24] khanqor: w pr move for sure
[1:21:29] StarShopping95: surely
[1:21:29] Ferg_6: It's transparency not leaking
[1:21:34] Lincstyle: Is their MMO dead? Lol
[1:21:36] TheBroCrow: multi-dollar company for sure
[1:21:39] xxMaverick: checkmate atheists
[1:21:39] justbeachi: who cares companies do layoffs all the time
[1:21:40] kags158: they planned on sharing the email when they first wrote it 100%
[1:21:41] Tombah: saying it is irrelevant is a shit take tho lol
[1:21:43] justbeachi: why is riot special
[1:21:51] Tombah: Tombah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:22:06] TirrinWoW: @justbeachi might wanna read the room my dude
[1:22:11] LionButLeon: Wokege
[1:22:12] JohntheBarbarian: @justbeachi yea and it sucks every time man, get some empathy
[1:22:14] Vampkenz: td:lr we hired too much and now we don't need them
[1:22:20] LionButLeon: Sadge
[1:22:22] PurpleKami: @Tombah it's the expected severance on a lay-off, I do not call that super good
[1:22:23] Atreayu: Madge
[1:22:26] toastbam: Madge

[1:22:38] roderikson: Madge
[1:22:43] Tombah: @PurpleKami if u think that package is "expected" you are mistaken lmfao.
[1:22:48] healapotamus: crazy they try to lay it all off on the customer and don’t just say we gunning for phat profits yo
[1:22:49] TheRealTarrjue: Riot had to make changes to SYSTEMS
[1:23:00] leubinator: we betted on the future and lost
[1:23:05] thecajuncommie: "Rioters"
[1:23:15] JakeParkbench: It looks like LoR got nailed for this

[1:23:41] Leo36s: read the next line tho
[1:23:43] itsmiraix: Goth boys ways
[1:23:44] JakeParkbench: Legally its a W, it sucks in every other way
[1:23:44] Sover31gn: Send them an in-game mail
[1:23:45] burnthekingx: id prefer that personally lol
[1:23:47] AoPsyke: they're warning them, but then they meet them face to face @Maximum
[1:23:48] Ronfendo: Companies out hee doing layoffs because the idea that profit growth is neverending...sad state we live in
[1:23:48] TheBroCrow: "You're fired" in the in game mail KEKW
[1:23:48] Coonser: everyone saying L has never been in an office waiting to meet with the bobs
[1:23:49] souledk: usually their manager tells them. that’s not a c level thing
[1:23:49] Frostyjoneslol: Its a W for a business becuz u dont have to deal with the begging for their job fiasco which saves the employee and employer
[1:23:50] Jeffp2662: Nah that meeting is the worst possible meeting - I'd much rather just get the emial
[1:23:50] GunsEvisu: imma show them was a real rioter is
[1:23:50] Salachavek: for a couple people to face but i see it with mass things like this
[1:23:50] Basic_3: THD is just gonna log in one day and not be in the guild.
[1:23:51] mujjating: legal w, humanity l
[1:23:52] Azkrust: If it’s a remote work situation, email makes sense
[1:23:53] hogbruhh: Would be worse if it was text instead of email I guess
[1:23:53] PurpleKami: Laying people off after the workday ended lmao
[1:23:54] ilaylow: L give the employee a forum to ask questions ALWAYS @Maximum
[1:23:55] ThisIzD: its like getting dumped in a text message.
[1:23:57] xhriiis: you do it through in game mail
[1:23:57] Mazkon: 50/50, managers doing the firing usually lies that it wasnt their decision anyway
[1:23:58] Muspel: I think it depends on the person. I'd rather get the news via email, because I don't want someone to tell me I'm fired to my face, that sounds insanely awkward. I just want to be upset in private.
[1:23:58] TheLuo: My company went through this recently and fucked up by not telling folks if they're at risk/safe RIGHT away. Created  A LOT of problems internally.
[1:23:59] Squats3: @Maximum imagine announcing your demotions on stream and saying "ill let them know in an hour or so"
[1:23:59] itsmiraix: goth both ways but you can’t really compare it to the guild because of the size
[1:23:59] dogmaster9000: what if you had to demote 500 guildies
[1:24:02] Atreayu: Better than showing up and being locked out of the building the next day
[1:24:02] Orange_SM: thats the same as breaking up with someone over text
[1:24:03] MoleDude: Hard to across a company that's spread out, and you don't want rumors spreading - so email might have been ok in this case
[1:24:03] Nickystr1x: @Maximum who would you have do it for you? either as a meme or who would do it best honestly
[1:24:04] CoffeeFlux: tbh email is better if you follow it with a call
[1:24:04] ruutangclan: imagine demoting someone through a /whisper
[1:24:04] Jjmn12: a lot of companies have people sit around for hours or days waiting to hear about their role, its better to tell everyone insta imo
[1:24:04] RaspiestMold: its a W when its 530 people fired
[1:24:05] Lupusdeus: I wonder if it will affect their MMO?
[1:24:05] gretriku: you're such a fucking coward if you can't tell them face to face, or voice to voice if you cant meet in person
[1:24:05] Durenas: I'd rather know asap and be able to make plans rather than wait in suspense
[1:24:08] silverblayde: difficult to do it at that scale though, you also don't want people waiting around for a calendar invite to let them know they've gotten fired
[1:24:08] Korentice: I mean, logistically getting in front of 500 people in a short amount of time isn't realistic
[1:24:10] Snydezz: I mean you are talking about 20 people vs hundreds possibly thousands right?
[1:24:10] seasonedcat1: They always do that for legal reasons and it is easier.
[1:24:12] Brobi: It's a W. We are talking about 530 people. Anyone that says its an L has never worked a day in their life
[1:24:12] Petahboi: @Maximum THD gets an email tho?
[1:24:13] LionButLeon: yea fuck that
[1:24:17] CoffeeFlux: drawing it out over multiple days of anxiety is _horrible_
[1:24:18] dingleberrum: fuck that shit I'd email
[1:24:18] seasonedcat1: no
[1:24:19] Sover31gn: Delegate
[1:24:20] Squats3: no you'd send it to team leads
[1:24:21] eduu9310: at least it was on a monday
[1:24:22] Dante20404: prob no
[1:24:23] OG_Kawngi: the shitty thing big corps do now is get them all on a Zoom call
[1:24:23] Ultratide_: Yall are weird af, either way youre fired lmao
[1:24:23] Sover31gn: But still face to face
[1:24:24] bpguns: no you have 100 directors and managers to do it
[1:24:25] ninemoreminutes: officers
[1:24:25] Keppie__: rather this than wait to long
[1:24:26] Scoops__: youd delegate to others
[1:24:26] Chronine: @Petahboi KEKW
[1:24:27] Muspel: Just make Driney do it
[1:24:27] Jeffp2662: @Brobi 100%
[1:24:29] Nickystr1x: I BET DRINEY WOULD JUST GET AN EMAIL
[1:24:32] ahri_feet_connoisseur: hire someone to do it
[1:24:33] gfkoe: you would delegate it but you wouldnt send them a generic email
[1:24:36] khanqor: yeah but still face to face
[1:24:37] Durenas: but what if a whole branch is cut
[1:24:37] larkhill: theres a viral video of a couple HR reps laying off an employee and getting recorded/roasted for it. email is the legal W
[1:24:39] Salachavek: except when you are firing directs
[1:24:39] SeanBad_: their managers should always be delivering the news and answering questions @Maximum
[1:24:40] Jeffp2662: What if you fired their boss
[1:24:41] ShadowDuelist21: Delegate
[1:24:42] malnourish_: makes me think of office space scene with michael bolton
[1:24:43] leubinator: DRINEY WOULD ONLY GET A SMS
[1:24:44] itsmiraix: so it hurta even more?
[1:24:46] Team_Spanky: @Maximum It depends. If I dont like making employees commute into work, just to let them go and send them home. If I can avoid them coming in and have a conversation over the phone with them, I find its easier for both parties
[1:24:46] dumnerd: @Nickystr1x wouldnt even get that
[1:24:47] TheBroCrow: @Nickystr1x Driney would get in-game mail KEKW
[1:24:49] Scoops__: like augmentation
[1:24:50] Archmage_Michael: not saying anything and just locking their keycard and system access is the best. ;-)
[1:24:55] MrKray2: should coming from the decision maker
[1:24:55] ilaylow: ITS ALWAYS BEST to give employees a forum to ask questions about whats next after a layoff
[1:24:56] Jeffp2662: You need HR to do it also or else you get sued
[1:24:57] Frostyjoneslol: With the sheer size email is best along with saving employees and employers embarrasment and the hardship thats already coming
[1:24:58] gui_rabello: YOUD STRAIGHT UP MASS REPORT DRINEY SO HE GETS BANNED AND GG
[1:25:00] seasonedcat1: HR sometimes call the employees
[1:25:02] Therealbrokensword: its like that scene from succession where he goes in and fires them all and walks out
[1:25:03] Tegraine: my old workplace canned an entire project with a couple hundred staff by email
[1:25:05] Convection: @OG_Kawngi That's what happened to us on the Solaris team at Oracle, except the VP announcing we were all fired pre-recorded his message.
[1:25:08] Chronine: Chronine subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 1 month streak! THD gets an email
[1:25:11] Ratatoskkr_: Ratatoskkr_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:25:11] Syrjyys: @TheBroCrow KEKW
[1:25:16] ThisIzD: Ghostcrawler saw the writing on the wall.
[1:25:17] JakeParkbench: @Maximum they use email since they need to do all layoffs at the same time to block any possible retaliation, scummy but its the way business is gonna be
[1:25:18] kevdeckie: well...they are having them meat their senior leader after the e-mail
[1:25:19] Coonser: which raid member would you be most worried about showing up at your door? i vote JPC
[1:25:19] StarShopping95: KEKW
[1:25:22] BigTrout3: L. i saw a meme of how to respond to an email as, "it seems like there was a hacker using your email to say I was fired. i know you're not a spineless, little bitch who'd do such a thing over email. I'm sure we'll laugh about it the morning. see you then!"
[1:25:22] ikMaxx: @Maximum What if you had to  pay salary only for 5 players and others you'd have to cut their salry completely. Would you do that yourself and tell the truth?
[1:25:24] GunsEvisu: driney would get a whisper
[1:25:27] Jeffp2662: yeah that shit SUCKS
[1:25:27] OG_Kawngi: it's for sure an L
[1:25:35] Scargon231: i've been through the 15 min interval thing. email might be an L, but it's a lowercase L
[1:25:36] Petahboi: @Maximum does THD get the email?
[1:25:36] Brobi: It's an insane W. @Maximum There is no good way of firing anyone, let alone 530 people at the same time
[1:25:37] faulen: As long as there is a follow up with a person
[1:25:42] larkhill: imagine 500+ zoom meetings in a week. no thanks
[1:25:50] SeraphimSentinel: Oh so they did both
[1:25:50] Ultratide_: riot went non verbal on them
[1:25:53] SeraphimSentinel: thats fine
[1:26:11] LionButLeon: PauseChamp
[1:26:13] Turkeypitz: you’d have to mentioned a global change, then make it personal with your lead etc
[1:26:13] Scoops__: they probably signed NDAs no?
[1:26:24] Incocknitoo: @Maximum did you saw the video of the cloudflare layoff? This was an L directly to the face
[1:26:25] faulen: fuck you...fuck you... you're cool... I'M OUT
[1:26:29] Shurafna: My whole department(50+) was laid off via zoom call. Was probably the only way to do it
[1:26:32] Maruika: max would  def just send driney an in game piece of mail telling him to pack his bags
[1:26:33] ahri_feet_connoisseur: severance is insane
[1:26:37] Squats3: i dont think thats how it works for people that want that letter of recommendation.
[1:26:38] Team_Spanky: @Maximum there is no good way to fire someone. If you look at it through the lens of what is best for the employee. You make your decision on how to deliver the message based on that.
[1:26:45] LionButLeon: Madge DUMB STREAMERS
[1:26:52] Ronfendo: thats a ton
[1:26:52] Mazkon: Thats a massive W
[1:26:53] Convection: It's normal
[1:26:53] domz_i: thats A LOT
[1:26:55] seasonedcat1: That is a lot.
[1:26:57] Archmage_Michael: 6 month is a very lot
[1:26:57] ilaylow: Email literally eliminates the opportunity for the employee to ask questions after they've been laid off.. It is definitely not the best way to do it for that reason alone
[1:26:57] Mezzedii: its a lot
[1:26:58] Ganryu22: it is a lot
[1:26:58] eduu9310: thats insane tbh
[1:26:59] silverblayde: need to sign a separation agreement basically saying you won't sue the company
[1:27:00] Shurafna: Huge W
[1:27:01] ThisIzD: pretty good in the states
[1:27:02] Jeffp2662: Thats AT LEAST double the norm
[1:27:02] Lara_TV_: As a minimum it's pretty high
[1:27:03] SVT_Dexter: it's pretty standard for a tech company
[1:27:03] saufringus: 6 months severance is insane. 6 weeks is more normal in the US
[1:27:03] null_sheen: that is alot
[1:27:04] Atreayu: usually
[1:27:05] Frostyjoneslol: 6 months of salary is ALOT more then 90% of the work population would get
[1:27:05] Yo_Dopejin: That's not normal that's pretty insane
[1:27:06] rickt0wn: that is high, usually like 2-3 months
[1:27:06] miniath_: almost certainly
[1:27:06] RaeRizzle: You usually have to sign a lot of stuff to get the severance usually
[1:27:07] lumaday: 6 mon is a ton
[1:27:07] Lara_TV_: People saying it's normal are wack
[1:27:07] domz_i: Most companies do 2weeks to 2 months
[1:27:08] Ganryu22: usually it's capped at 3/4 months
[1:27:08] Tombah: its MINIMUM of 6 months, im sure it will fluctuate with each role also. senior roles, etc
[1:27:09] NickFPV: Thats what Blizzard did
[1:27:11] slappadabas5: Yes they do
[1:27:13] CoffeeASAP: that's what I got when I was layed off from a retail dvd store lol
[1:27:14] noewon: RageyBoom only 6 months salary ! should be 12
[1:27:15] Archmage_Michael: 6 month -> NDA 100%
[1:27:15] lolwhateverdog: 6 months is pretty high comparitively. 2 months or more normal, or something like 2 weeks per year of employment
[1:27:18] souledk: I’ve worked in tech for 20 years and 6 months is insane
[1:27:18] texas_grizzly: It's not really and NDA, it's more like a "don't talk shit"
[1:27:20] Octopiii: normally a "you can't sue us" agreement
[1:27:20] Lincstyle: That's a fuckton
[1:27:22] limed: Thats standard
[1:27:28] grobb12: not in a software dev job
[1:27:28] Team_Spanky: @Maximum in cases of severance packages, They sign a waiver to lawsuit, and a NDA.
[1:27:30] Lincstyle: Most places are 2 weeks per year of service

[1:27:35] faulen: Na, that is standard
[1:27:35] slappadabas5: my wife got 1 month in hoispitality
[1:27:35] Convection: You don't have to sign an NDA, you sign a contract to get all of this but it's effectively only enforced by the fact that bringing a lawsuit is too expensive.
[1:27:38] Lara_TV_: Minimum*
[1:27:40] ahri_feet_connoisseur: huge W from a company
[1:27:40] JackOfAllApocalypses: separation agreement, techniocally, not NDA
[1:27:42] Mezamete: its generally 1 week per year you worked there.

[1:28:05] limed: The equity one is huge
[1:28:05] Tombah: W
[1:28:06] SeraphimSentinel: Yeah I mean, I think they handled this very well ngl. Companies are gonna make hiring 'bets' forever, and when you lose the bet you have to fire people, if you handle the firing well, fuck it.
[1:28:08] ahri_feet_connoisseur: free money
[1:28:09] ilaylow: @Maximum if you get a new job fast enough its literally a massive bonus

[1:28:30] JQ47: Sorry I saw she was effected by these layoffs
[1:28:33] gfkoe: yeah if they are getting a 5-10% bonus that really good
[1:28:34] ninemoreminutes: 20% of salary is kinda normal
[1:28:37] Thirdheaven: 20k=1month of rent in cali
[1:28:37] Drizoon: Sookie about to have a Brink trunk outside youre house next week
[1:28:39] Archmage_Michael: I would like to be fired with these conditions. 6 month money for free is awesome
[1:28:43] bodkinz_: Riot they will.
[1:28:46] Jeffp2662: I've never heard of getting your bonus as part of a layoff
[1:28:51] limed: Sorry to hear about the layoff @SookiePark

[1:28:53] BigTrout3: love mic breathing YEP
[1:28:59] gradyb87: Sadge
[1:29:06] MHMabrito: I mean, we can say they don't want people to shit talk their company, but maybe they're just doing right by the employees they have to let go. I see it all as a W.
[1:29:09] ImjustBatin: COBRA health plan
[1:29:15] CoffeeFlux: it basically just means they're paying for COBRA
[1:29:16] Jeffp2662: that's pretty normal
[1:29:17] Mezzedii: cobra hella expensive
[1:29:19] texas_grizzly: Basically the employer is subsidising the COBRA
[1:29:21] M3xM: Max, when are you going to do the (inevitable?) tier list with beloved guests for upcoming tier sets in s4 since they're all over the place
[1:29:21] Therealbrokensword: american health insurance is just wild to me
[1:29:22] hemofeeliac: yeah its called COBRA pay

[1:32:06] Squats3: @Maximum this is very clear "we just need to have our revenue be up and dont care what we have to spend to get there"
[1:32:07] TheRealTarrjue: @maximum the size of thid package is not normal, this is mega
[1:32:08] JakeParkbench: Nah Elon would fuck you in the ass and tell you to clean it up on the way out

[1:32:16] miniath_: check him PC this is not normally
[1:32:17] Scargon231: can confirm, this isn't abnormal for tech
[1:32:18] dkwallas: For big tech they will do more than this, but for gaming not sure
[1:32:18] Jack_the_Dipper: Riot Games has a policy regarding their equity. If a Rioter has received Riot shares from vesting their single-vesting RSUs, they will get to keep them, subject to their terms and conditions. This also applies to other vested instruments (like options, or cash-settled SARs in certain jurisdictions such as China)
[1:32:18] octnoir: Let's add 530 to ***
[1:32:19] BigTrout3: you couldn't ask for a better severance
[1:32:21] Convection: They don't ask for the stuff they bought for you back, it's not worth the time/effort
[1:32:21] MHMabrito: This is probably the best layoff package to ever exist. It's a straight W. This isn't even normal for MOST tech.
[1:32:23] Montanaught012: Riot has a reputation to uphold

[1:32:25] bitcoinonlyfans: not this good for tech
[1:32:26] ninemoreminutes: this is the please don't give us bad PR package
[1:32:26] larkhill: normal for big tech in the public eye, not any random tech
[1:32:26] grobb12: i work in biotech and its similar if a company shuts down
[1:32:27] Scargon231: tech companies tend to get people that come back. if you screw them, they won't want to come back
[1:32:28] StarShopping95: EZ
[1:32:29] jerkmcgee: tech is cushy bro
[1:32:31] Montanaught012: still makes them look attractive as an employer
[1:32:32] lolwhateverdog: @maximum this is extremely normal in general, but not this high of $$. that is usually reserved for massive companies, like FB/google/etc.
[1:32:34] LionButLeon: @RaeRizzle u can just spill it 3 years later EZ

[1:32:51] ShadowDuelist21: YEP
[1:32:52] lolwhateverdog: @maximum yes, the severance is one big check at once lol
[1:32:52] maneatingpotato1: Usually one month per year of "service"
[1:32:53] Jack_the_Dipper: But watch out with tax on that
[1:32:54] Mezamete: you get it, one check.
[1:32:55] faulen: Taxes would be a bitch
[1:32:55] StoneColdKittyy: Double dippy but the job market is really horrible right now
[1:32:56] Lincstyle: You keep it
[1:32:56] Yo_Dopejin: Happened with my last job
[1:32:57] herptyderptyqwerty: the double D EZ
[1:32:57] Jnxz: severance is typically based upon years of service w/ the org

[1:33:01] noewon: SKIP double dip
[1:33:02] Koodiijr: @Maximum The company I work for does the same thing its crazy the older guys who had 40+ years got 3 years severance and live time free internet at employee price is crazy
[1:33:02] malnourish_: that assumes theres another job for you to take
[1:33:03] Zarroe: that's if you're lucky enough to get another job
[1:33:04] BigTrout3: yes. barring a stipulation or some jokey juky shit
[1:33:04] fadedglyph: it usually is just one check
[1:33:04] Ukillay: Otherwise you wouldn't be looking for a job for 6 months

[1:33:16] Goodnevi1: I think you don't know today's job market, 6 months is not long
[1:33:17] TheLuo: @Maximum thing is - if there is a company doing layoffs it normally means the entire industry is doing it.
[1:33:20] larkhill: problem is, theres 500 other people now also looking for the same job you are
[1:33:23] Jack_the_Dipper: @Maximum true but they can put it on their CCV

[1:35:51] SneakyWoodPecker: Ya the RIOT MMO is not going to see the light of day
[1:35:54] PurpleKami: @d0mezg4mer yeah they made a post about that sadly
[1:35:58] Muspel: Wild Rift probably used to be called "League Mobile" internally, so they likely started calling it "League PC" to keep it straight
[1:36:01] joeminister: PC in the name is probably just a copyright thing
[1:36:04] Squats3: greg got out in time
[1:36:09] Monicaisblue: Sadge sookie
[1:36:12] misran: my enthusiasm for riot MMO went down big time when ghostcrawler left
[1:36:13] LionButLeon: @SneakyWoodPecker doubt they cut it lol

[1:36:15] ezztabob: Project L is gonna go hard
[1:36:17] JakeParkbench: Nah its LoR that got ripped
[1:36:19] rzocys0: it seems like its mainly the riot forge games @Maximum
[1:36:22] leubinator: no way they make a mmo if they are down bad on money
[1:36:26] Mastodonian: They cut non dev jobs yeah
[1:36:35] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Long winded say of saying "LoR aint making money"
[1:36:35] avideonut: that fighting game is gotta be dead tho
[1:36:40] Jazzarus_: @leubinator that mmo will be huge and will make them more money than league
[1:36:43] miniath_: I def felt like 3 years ago that riot was going too wide on projects they announced
[1:36:51] bigtony466: LoR is a bangergame
[1:37:00] tyler___: LoR o7

[1:37:13] ahri_feet_connoisseur: is LoR even good?
[1:37:17] saltman112: its too linear compared to hearthstone and mtg coming from a former pro hearthstone player
[1:37:18] kadashy1: dude runeterra was so fun I don't even remember why i stopped playing it
[1:37:18] ColdIceCreamMan: riot forge is sad... some many cool games
[1:37:21] Jnxz: is Riot also developing Ashes of Creation or no?

[1:37:27] xxpurplehazen: only 10k Stare
[1:37:31] guynormally: Favorite magic mana?
[1:37:36] ahri_feet_connoisseur: i worked in the studio that did LoR art and holy shit is it expensive/a lot of work
[1:37:40] ductor283: marvel snap came out after LoR and windmill dunked it into the ground so that was over for it
[1:37:44] Basic_3: LoR was pretty fun, but I didn't stick with it for whatever reason
[1:37:52] Fizzbot125: LoR is to Hearthstone as HotS was to League
[1:37:52] skydollnoa: @jnxz no. thats anotger studio
[1:37:53] thunder993: Visually hearthstone clears Lor though
[1:37:56] ahri_feet_connoisseur: LoR is very niche

[1:38:06] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @thunder993 not one bit IMO
[1:38:06] legitunplayable: legitunplayable subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 3months subbed already. Time flies.
[1:38:07] Romper_Stomper_Z: it is a great game, but came in too late, resolved many issues of other games, but lacked originality. its just improvement of existing games
[1:38:14] ninemoreminutes: the pve is good imo
[1:38:14] cosmo30k: i like the honesty
[1:38:15] Jnxz: @skydollnoa  - ty! didn't know that
[1:38:38] ColdIceCreamMan: riot forge games were great. ruined king was a banger
[1:38:43] BigTheTank: The riot forge stuff sucks, those were some cool little games
[1:39:03] oqqiH: what happened to their arpg

[1:45:44] Hopefulx: @TheRealTarrjue no
[1:45:49] oqqiH: LoR getting poopoo’d on is a big L. That game did so much in terms of world building for the franchise.
[1:45:58] TheRealTarrjue: Sadge
[1:46:07] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @oqqiH they're gonna have those artists work on differnent projects instead
[1:46:11] LionButLeon: @oqqiH sadly it aint getting money into the bank so KEKBye
[1:46:12] skydollnoa: actually have a question for chat, i m currently guildless and friendless player on wow. what would be the best way to get into low level mythic?  never ran mythic before
[1:46:34] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @oqqiH I worked for the studio that did a large part of LoR art. A lot of the GIGACHAD artists are now working on concept art for other league projects :)
[1:46:40] TheRealTarrjue: Mythic+ or mythic raid @skydollnoa ?
[1:46:47] Urebaldd: Take off all his gear and beg for carries
[1:46:53] skydollnoa: mythic +
[1:47:06] skydollnoa: i m only 460 ilvp
[1:47:08] Felizzpe: sup guys! can we actually drop the night blade from vine cracked junkbox?

[1:47:45] skydollnoa: i dont like using my gender either lol
[1:47:52] skydollnoa: @urebaldd kk ty
[1:48:11] ahri_feet_connoisseur: @oqqiH the really good artists are working. Gerard Parel for example went from LoR -> general league concept art. He's insane
[1:48:35] i_cassius: @skydollnoa also get raider io addon/app
[1:48:44] MoistyBlizz: If there's a Riot employee among us, I want to express my empathy. At Blizzard, we comprehend the difficulty of encountering such messages, and our hearts go out to you.

[1:50:19] Aizen_NP: damn he abandoned us :(
[1:50:21] JackOfAllApocalypses: probably the security system people
[1:50:28] JQ47: Hard chance he is done. Sookie was part of the layoffs I saw on Twitter.
[1:50:47] goekenaitor: ^
[1:50:54] TheRealTarrjue: @skydollnoa *** is kind of en enhancement to the presentation of the rating system (it used to be the inly rating system). It will help you get into groups later but is not necessary for actually doing any given key.
[1:51:01] TheRealTarrjue: Raider io
[1:51:24] AtomJar: @skydollnoa dont worry about add ons for low keys. Sign up for some 2-5s with your ilvl you should get in. Dont stress too much about making mistakes as at that key lvl your gear can carry alot.

[1:52:23] ModestMewtwo21: @Maximum Oh shit did she get laid off? I came into the stream late so Idk whats goin on
[1:52:24] Angeels: well did you

[1:52:25] Nyraell: but did you though?

[1:52:27] Ronfendo: Youre the rizzler, we just assume
[1:52:28] Aizen_NP: so you did?
[1:52:28] Mattyboh: I would lock down my house for you
[1:52:29] skydollnoa: because we care
[1:52:30] AndyBoyLIVE: not a no
[1:52:32] OG_Kawngi: did you get a Vision Pro lil bro
[1:52:33] TheRealTarrjue: Answer the question

[1:52:58] peanutz413: i need my daily dose of sweet dawg
[1:53:08] Ronfendo: @rustycans Investors expect that profits grow YoY
[1:53:15] ahri_feet_connoisseur: something to do with terrible interest rates for tech companies right
[1:53:16] LionButLeon: ALOO
[1:53:16] Gamerhcp: hi Lilly
[1:53:19] Gamerhcp: hi Ella
[1:53:20] peanutz413: sweet dawgs
[1:53:24] MoistyBlizz: thank you Max for covering this, its important. All of us game developers hurt when we see layoffs like this.   love your dogs and her cow <3
[1:53:25] Lukatoz: Company I work for also did a ton of layoffs today, 5%
[1:53:29] octnoir: Did you see *** website? it is noting 10,500 layooffs since 2024 Started
[1:53:31] nanerpus_: Saying all of tech is down is a really big misconception of how this problem came about
[1:53:32] rbgdev: do you foresee any impacts like this for Blizzard?
[1:53:33] sun_oce: This is definitely not a good time to be a computer science graduate
[1:53:34] Faraday5001: W cow
[1:53:34] planooooooooooooooooooooo: god these dogs are too adorable i can't even handle it
[1:53:35] octnoir: lol 10.5k layoffs in a month

[1:53:38] leubinator: looks like a lilly toy
[1:53:43] Maruika: displates looking good G
[1:53:44] Jjmn12: nanoleafs looking great
[1:53:49] Shockology101: since when have you had 3 dogs?
[1:53:50] Ronfendo: Its crazy because companies aren't even "down" they just aren't making as much money as they were, at some point companies have to realize there is going to be an upper limit to what profits are attainable.
[1:53:51] Blightrose: slysssHAPPY
[1:53:55] LionButLeon: Sadge
[1:54:00] Cakerinotv: tech industry is going through a ton of layoffs
[1:54:01] TheRealTarrjue: @maximum I don't think this is specific to game development. Riot reinvested A LOT of their covid profits into the company, which would be good if the economy wasn't in the state its in. They overestimated their position as many companies have.
[1:54:02] Camelbak21: It's not about how much money the company makes, it's about how they can justify having X positions
[1:54:06] wow_noboat: live suki interview?
[1:54:07] MemphisGamingTTV: Wishing her all the best
[1:54:07] CoffeeASAP: She should join the poddy c (pay her)
[1:54:12] Unius_: man lilly is so cute, i am kinda reconsidering my fav dog breed because of her
[1:54:13] coollerrx: Tech is in a bad spot right now
[1:54:14] Ruinx81: Liquid Suki
[1:54:15] Rictamar: 6 months of double dip could be poggers
[1:54:17] planooooooooooooooooooooo: Pog amped salary buff

[1:54:20] justmorm: get her on bt poddyc
[1:54:27] xxpurplehazen: 6month vaca pog
[1:54:27] maiadabee: salary cleave
[1:54:28] rbgdev: will blizzard be impacted?
[1:54:36] defund_pug: Do you know if blue yeti makes a different shaped mics? I can't have mine on my desk longer than 5 minutes without it ending up in my mouth
[1:54:38] Aizen_NP: sooki full time twitch mod incoming pog
[1:54:38] fateggnogg: I was laid off from a tech position a few months ago, it's rough out there for everyone
[1:54:42] Camelbak21: blizzard has like no esports scene lol

[1:54:51] nightst314: a handful a month ago
[1:54:52] skydollnoa: couple months ago no?
[1:54:53] turnipstampede: Bobby B was still in office
[1:54:56] SVT_Dexter: They didn't have to when everyone quit with the scandals
[1:54:56] Jarlan23: they did it for overewatch
[1:54:56] nanerpus_: The same call in which they announced record revenue
[1:54:57] peanutz413: will you Liquid Guys go hard in fated seasons or take it slow?
[1:54:57] Xann_: Prob the QA layoffs a few years ago^^
[1:54:59] RoVcoVeR: should've laid off Bobby K
[1:55:00] skydollnoa: didnt they do layoff last year
[1:55:01] Rictamar: if the Diablo xpac and War Within don't hit, expect layoffs I'd bet
[1:55:02] misran: well OWL just died but the team wasn't that big
[1:55:03] mattyzees: bobby had that shit running tight af already
[1:55:04] Byggareebob: CEO cuts his pay by 10% and layoffs arent needed 4Head
[1:55:05] exteps: it wasl ike 2 months ago yeah
[1:55:10] Goats48: Max can I get mod?
[1:55:10] LionButLeon: OMEGALUL
[1:55:10] Ronfendo: @ajaxdh Blizz seems to be taking the opposite approach, the Microsoft deal makes it feel like they are going to try and hire and grow to become a sturdy company longterm?
[1:55:10] NickFPV: blizzard forced in office which had alot of people leave the company. A smart lay off work adound
[1:55:13] Jack_the_Dipper: Marrch 2019 800 layed off
[1:55:16] nightst314: The OWL and Esports staff last year
[1:55:16] OG_Kawngi: you getting hard lil bro?
[1:55:17] Jjmn12: like will you be bricked
[1:55:17] destrominater: hearthstone was hit hard. month or two ago
[1:55:20] turnipstampede: like will you brick up the fated season?
[1:55:21] CoffeeASAP: are you going to rizz up fated
[1:55:22] malnourish_: BIG HARD
[1:55:22] gretriku: september i remember seeing Blizz layoffs
[1:55:24] chubbytheboi: Will you be bricked up in the fated season?
[1:55:24] AoPsyke: no RWF in fated
[1:55:24] Durenas: RTWF again lol
[1:55:26] OG_Kawngi: get hard Stare
[1:55:27] itsthelichqueen: At Activision we didn't have layoff from what I know
[1:55:28] MemphisGamingTTV: They can't prog old bosses lol
[1:55:31] malavander: economy is actually doing great, tech is just having bit of a bubble bust phase
[1:55:35] TheRealTarrjue: Fated RWF was a meme in shadowlands
[1:55:35] JohntheBarbarian: bricked gaming? Pog
[1:55:44] skydollnoa: @maximum did u talk about ur thoughts on the winning votes?
[1:55:45] Ronfendo: @NickFPV Thats the single biggest fight in Tech right now, in office vs remote work
[1:55:47] KaisenSiru: OhMyDog
[1:55:48] Slaytime101: World First Fated kills?
[1:55:48] Jack_the_Dipper: 800 layoffs on March 2019 at Blizzard @Maximum
[1:55:48] thaugtless: is there going to be a fun race
[1:55:55] ThreesFG: They always go hard
[1:55:55] theDirtyon3: maximumElla maximumLilly
[1:56:04] d0mezg4mer: get sookie in at blizz get them microsoft dollars
[1:56:13] halfwaythug: we invested our companies profits into icecream. We thought it would rise in value over the enxt couple of years. Turned out it melted - really sorry PoroSad
[1:56:17] Rictamar: lots of tech companies overleveraged themselves with cheap cash when interest rates were low, and are fucked now
[1:56:18] kelly_mac06: yea
[1:56:21] kelly_mac06: that it was
[1:56:32] kelly_mac06: damn sorry to hear about Sookie :(
[1:56:32] kriegborne: sookie blizz insider knowledge
[1:56:35] nightst314: 800 was all of ATVI, blizzard layed of 230, but lots of CM staff
[1:56:38] Team_Spanky: @Maximum how about getting players from some top guilds, and randomly group them in raid groups and race the fated raids. See which group can get the furthest on a reset or something
[1:56:40] NickFPV: @Maximum They also enforce in-office work. Which lost them a solid amount of employees. They might not need to lay anyone off for a bit.
[1:56:43] Santalama: mhmm
[1:56:45] Blightrose: dawww
[1:56:48] faulen: yeah when she wants to go out
[1:56:48] Troniin: Yazma is a nightmare at 27 and up

[1:56:50] itsthelichqueen: I want to be a community manager for Blizz so that kinda stressed me out.
[1:56:50] daiger5o: maximumFEAR
[1:56:52] Santalama: mine does that too. but its because shewants to lick my face
[1:56:54] maneatingpotato1: Its how they find serenity
[1:56:56] Camelbak21: @halfwaythug Part of that investment is also hiring people, it's a 5050
[1:57:04] Richthofen187: my dog put her whole head there cause she didnt have a nose
[1:57:10] MrChaCho: My dog shoves her head between our thighs
[1:57:13] ahri_feet_connoisseur: forcing someone to live in LA will do that to ya
[1:57:23] MoistyBlizz: those of us who are disabled still can work remotely or hybrid like me.
[1:57:37] wayaton: well they made more living in a state other than cali cause of cost of housing I would have been mad too its a massive paycut to go back into office
[1:57:38] itsthelichqueen: @NickFPV At ATVI at the main QA office they enforced it.
[1:57:41] ahri_feet_connoisseur: not just LA but irvine
[1:57:44] Wheva: Willing to be a bunch of those blizzard people who left due to no more WFH are regretting that decision in this market
[1:57:47] ahri_feet_connoisseur: isnt irvine BiS in LA
[1:57:53] ahri_feet_connoisseur: WiS8
[1:57:59] d0mezg4mer: thats what blizzard does
[1:58:01] Wheva: bet*
[1:58:01] toastbam: ?
[1:58:02] Rijotto: Im not flaming by any means. but have you even opened wow in the last two hours? just chatting with chat yea?
[1:58:04] Horisafit87: Irvine is orange county
[1:58:06] misran: irvine is a concrete jungle it sucks
[1:58:06] NickFPV: @ahri_feet_connoisseur Techically Blizzard is much more south of LA. Still LA metro area. But the cost of living is insane
[1:58:13] itsthelichqueen: Monday-Friday Remote is what ATVI is doing in Quebec
[1:58:14] OG_Kawngi: irvine is  how you throw money away
[1:58:16] MoistyBlizz: most of us can't afford to live in Irvine haha
[1:58:17] skydollnoa: irvine is oc
[1:58:18] NickFPV: TRUE! I grew up near irvine. Soooo sleepy
[1:58:20] jerkmcgee: orange county has 0 character, completely soulless
[1:58:23] malavander: safest city in America 19 years running
[1:58:24] toastbam: orange county is not la
[1:58:27] TL_izPanda: Pog I'm LA
[1:58:28] Rictamar: F for those who are mandated to go to the office, I will never take my fully remote job for granted
[1:58:29] KaisenSiru: LA Pog
[1:58:29] turnipstampede: is downtown LA, LA?
[1:58:29] theDirtyon3: San Fran is LA YEP
[1:58:30] LiviingTrash: irvine is orange county not LA
[1:58:31] jasmine12123: im in irvine ill go spit on blizzard now
[1:58:31] oqqiH: Irvine has good food but shit drivers
[1:58:33] MedicineMan: lived in Irvine. hate it. one company owns the entire city
[1:58:33] d0mezg4mer: irvine is far from everything, mass suburbs, expensive for no reason, biggest highlight is a mall
[1:58:39] chinwinz: i wouldnt say anaheim is LA
[1:58:40] NickFPV: Its great metro LA area. Max is right
[1:58:41] wayaton: lol its not all la
[1:58:41] Wheva: Sookie should work for Liquid and be your boss again
[1:58:41] TheBroCrow: Is Nebraska LA?
[1:58:42] Horisafit87: oc isnt la
[1:58:45] gwenmh: the writing has been on the walls for LoR for a while now, that game was extremely undermonitized compared to snap and magic and hearthstone
[1:58:45] skydollnoa: anaheim and irvine is oc
[1:58:47] Durenas: TBH I'd rather live in WA state
[1:58:48] oqqiH: orange is not LA
[1:58:51] volcatus: As someone who works in Irvine I promise you Orange County is not LA
[1:58:57] LionButLeon: I would GIGACHAD
[1:59:03] ahri_feet_connoisseur: only LA locals know what is and isnt LA
[1:59:08] LiviingTrash: i grew up in socal anaheim is still not LA lol
[1:59:09] skydollnoa: irvine is expensive because theres tons of colleges nearby
[1:59:09] Maruika: they got the mighty ducks tho so they are far better
[1:59:12] ordained02: Irvine is orange county and Irvine sucks, I did a lot of work just a bit concrete jungle with nothing but generic shit I hated Irvine.
[1:59:15] herptyderptyqwerty: Los Alamos, New Mexico? Pog
[1:59:19] Cv_82: would NVR live CA
[1:59:22] Ronfendo: did you get trues?
[1:59:25] NickFPV: Literally type in "Greater LA metropolitan area" its all LA
[1:59:26] skydollnoa: irvine is in the middle of all the college in that area
[1:59:27] TheRealTarrjue: I think a lot of people are looking at looking at low inflation, low unemployment and trying to reconcile layoffs as "it's just a bubble popping" as if its localized. That's true but it's looming over everyone and you can look no further than consumer debt growing at a rapid rate. Lot of people racking of credit card debt and using pay later services. It's not localized.
[1:59:34] mi_dude: baked
[1:59:34] Ronfendo: what hollow?
[1:59:36] mycho_: baked? they cooked them shits?
[1:59:39] MoistyBlizz: I just got home like 30 minutes ago from irvine, took me 3 hours to get home SADGE. lol
[1:59:42] LionButLeon: baked Gladge
[1:59:42] theDirtyon3: baked skates YEP
[1:59:43] wayaton: these citys are just outside of la 0.0
[1:59:44] Hairoglyph: 3am 4am no traffic ez
[1:59:48] jasmine12123: you can drive 20 mins to diff countries in europe, that doesn't mean you're still in the same place
[1:59:49] coffee_magic: stayin in the south bay bubbles not too bad

[2:02:04] Rictamar: very based
[2:02:11] Therealbrokensword: true, but however they should do a few weeks of no affix to see

[2:02:23] Arvakr: jb was suffering today during fyrakk

[2:02:33] BiBaButzeBenne: they could have one week without affixes
[2:02:34] TheBroCrow: Aware
[2:02:34] Yanoru: Aware
[2:02:34] ahri_feet_connoisseur: remove m+ BASED
[2:02:40] malnourish_: give us good seasonals PLS
[2:02:40] MemphisGamingTTV: Keep fortified and tyranical at least
[2:02:40] booznoon: i agree, like come on ofc its not fun to interact with storming but something with variety would be great
[2:02:41] q48live: theres a reason everybody runs 0 affixes on ptr keys.
[2:02:42] CarteretGC: remove affix, keep tyran and fort
[2:02:54] Darklott: do you think a system like greater rifts from diablo 3 would work for wow m+ @Maximum
[2:02:58] Camelbak21: KEKW
[2:02:59] wntrmut3_: agree^^ just fort/tyran
[2:03:02] xJeria: 1 seasonal affix and thats it
[2:03:04] Rictamar: haha so true
[2:03:04] skydollnoa: @carteretgc more 6 min irikdrion fight?
[2:03:06] icebreakxd: LUL
[2:03:06] ahri_feet_connoisseur: because blizzard OMEGALUL
[2:03:07] rhino_u: true
[2:03:10] Therealbrokensword: hot take: make season 4 like the pbe where they rotate a few affixes and you add them yourself if you want like the PBE, with score being the incentive
[2:03:10] RaeRizzle: Bolstering needs to go as well
[2:03:11] ZACKandATTACK: @Maximum I feel like Affixes should be buffs to make the dungeons feel different week by week and make you specifically want to play that week
[2:03:13] Aizen_NP: sanguin is fun
[2:03:21] LionButLeon: @Aizen_NP ban him
[2:03:27] Slaytime101: @Aizen_NP Get him out
[2:03:28] Darksynth: what if tyrannical added another boss mechanic instead of just a hp/dmg increase
[2:03:29] ninemoreminutes: he has an alternative idea as well above
[2:03:33] daiger5o: Encrypted shrouded
[2:03:34] relicz: rotating every other week of the 2 best seasonals
[2:03:35] CruuuLest: the two best seasonal affixes we had replace tyrann fort? monkaHmm
[2:03:37] Olivens: @Aizen_NP purge him
[2:03:42] Ronfendo: fort is so boring
[2:03:44] pratzil: Buffs not negative
[2:03:46] Camelbak21: real
[2:03:47] aelimas: yeah they should make fort feel awful too
[2:03:50] AshinaNoble: give positive affixes
[2:03:51] CarteretGC: @skydollnoa you gotta do SOMETHING
[2:03:56] mycho_: @aelimas  baseg
[2:03:56] Cebs131: Affix is the reason it isn't played
[2:03:57] drewsky96: i think that affixes where if you play around it you gain something other than time need to be cooked into regular affixes, not just seasonals
[2:04:00] Jazzarus_: the rotating dungeon pool removes the need for affixes
[2:04:01] Valshaw: affix-less season would be boring after the first week
[2:04:02] skiboots: remove the "push week" concept, not healthy
[2:04:05] turnipstampede: EGG
[2:04:18] senexis: Healer dies on pack before Morchie, 23 Rise. Healer releases, we die +30 sec later. We wait for healer to rez. 487 Warrior releases and says "why dont you run mate" we say, to save time. He says, "you know what, I dont want to play with you c:" and bricks the whole key. How are we supposed to play this game?
[2:04:20] DeathlyRaiser: I like trying to see how high my group can stack bursting then cloaking it and seeing who lives
[2:04:20] Ronfendo: will they they?
[2:04:20] Biscuitpaw: I would love a positive only affix season
[2:04:22] MrChaCho: What about some type of system where you choose your own affixes for your key. There would be positive and negative affixes to choose from and each would have it's own modifier to your key's potential score. Negative affixes increase the amount of score possible, positive lower it.
[2:04:27] Ruinx81: Incorporeal next week sweeeeeeet
[2:04:30] Sover31gn: Maybe you could trade an affix for less time/stronger bosses
[2:04:36] Ronfendo: all that wwill happen is people will pick the "easy" affixes
[2:04:39] larkhill: give me +1 piece of loot for each affix
[2:04:41] DrQuackzalver: what if each affix doubled your loot? crest and all
[2:04:44] StanRaenslen: yeah positive affixes like fated raids
[2:04:45] Therealbrokensword: what if they made it so that each affix was worth x amount of points to you rating?
[2:04:45] Thasin22: i think they should just do seasonal with fort
[2:04:47] ninemoreminutes: lmao that cheifs tweet
[2:04:48] ahri_feet_connoisseur: why does negative affixes even need to exist? Why can't M+ compete on time trial basis
[2:04:59] spiritcheese: @larkhill +1 this
[2:04:59] themadbunny275: I love seasonal affix's that involved mini bosses like shroud or encrypted
[2:05:04] Camelbak21: Yeah, positive affixes also restricts gameplay in you can only do X pull with X buff
[2:05:04] LionButLeon: xdd
[2:05:04] Cakerinotv: arent affixes by nature negative
[2:05:04] Jazzarus_: what we really need is deterministic loot from m+
[2:05:05] Zircons: LOGIN
[2:05:06] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[2:05:06] i_cassius: or higher rating when you apply affixes
[2:05:08] mycho_: xdd
[2:05:10] nightst314: @Maximum I wrote a basically 6 page post on M+ last year on the community council, nobody read it. Might take a look at it. If all things are met, M+ might be in the best state.
[2:05:11] Arvakr: he was SUFFERING today during fyrakk
[2:05:15] daiger5o: KEKW
[2:05:15] Maruika: jb has a top tier twitter account, top tier
[2:05:20] Sekht: pick your own positive could be cool. Pick an positive buff for your group
[2:05:23] ahri_feet_connoisseur: SAJ
[2:05:24] MemphisGamingTTV: Maybe take the idea of creating your own key, but depending on what affix you put on or the number of affixes you put on gives you more rating.
[2:05:24] kelly_mac06: oh man
[2:05:27] kelly_mac06: he was hating life
[2:05:29] Zircons: he just doesnt like raiding
[2:05:30] Ferg_6: he wants to log in buy gear from a vendor and log out forever
[2:05:30] Lara_TV_: bathing in frontals
[2:05:31] BobPlaysTheGames: Is the existence of push weeks really that bad? I kinda like it
[2:05:31] Zircons: i feel it
[2:05:35] Jack_the_Dipper: Maybe a random out of know where question but Im redoing key bindingsngs. Targeting with scroll up and down scroll wheel smart or not? @Maximum

[2:06:15] Arvakr: and drinking red wine
[2:06:17] maneatingpotato1: He was full teletubbie
[2:06:19] q48live: affixes are only fun for the people that play this game 8+ hours every day. normies who only get 2-4 hrs of keys a couple times a week dont want to reprog dungeons every week with different affixes
[2:06:25] PleaseLessen: P1 disc priest movement had him down bad lol

[2:17:56] OG_Kawngi: the problem is scarlet/violet sold 22+ million while being amongst the worst in the series
[2:17:58] A_Trask: it’s not comparable to Pokémon in terms of gameplay, it’s more survival progression
[2:18:04] OG_Kawngi: pokemon fans will eat anything up
[2:18:10] RaeRizzle: Pokemon knows that people will pay for what ever shit game they put out
[2:18:11] Arylena: don’t the, developers embrace AI, it would be kinda disappointing to see you play it as an artist and game dev imho

[2:19:54] slickrazor2: @Basic_3 thankfully no its shit
[2:19:54] thoromyr19: I play both games and want both to be successful. Tribalism is silly. Make both better.
[2:19:56] ishka422: steailing gameplay is fine, but no relly, they jsut stole the designs fo the pokemon

[2:21:22] gretriku: @Basic_3 they have criterion dungeons which if you squint hard enough  look kinda/sorta/maybe inspired by M+ but its still very much its own thing
[2:21:34] ishka422: the ehing is that thers has been competing pokemon style games for years, but they  didn't plagerize
[2:21:43] zirkzez: @gretriku and m+ is stole from gw2

[2:37:28] totemic_: builds are very subjective, i disagree with maxroll on many things in many builds
[2:37:29] OG_Kawngi: it's like soulslike viewers
[2:37:49] enigmasvea: @RaeRizzle lirly updated yesterday LUL
[2:38:02] Turkeypitz: sorc has a lot of decent builds - maybe not s tier - but still solid
[2:38:03] mycho_: even without the uniques i was able to one shot uber lilith with this, was so busted
[2:38:11] dubbyatt: that was op with a vampire power that gave you perma unstoppable
[2:38:21] AerialAce94: that was OP vamp power made it up all the time
[2:38:31] RaeRizzle: @enigmasvea yeh thats because its the start of a season. It gets really out dated quick

[2:40:39] mycho_: it'll still be a good build just not giga busted
[2:40:42] Turkeypitz: afaik they had added a '0', there's a few changes the add up to a nerf - how big a nerf is not currently known
[2:40:50] FerryDLX: No mana refund on procced casts of skills

[2:42:32] FerryDLX: Well ypur meteors proc firewalls and the firewalls are proccing new meteors
[2:42:33] zirkzez: firewall is about the most boring skill ive ever seen on a arpg
[2:42:41] parse219: the new construct pet you have theres an ability that will give you mana that every sorc will run most likely

[2:51:39] flippyoka: same thing about xp builds in d3
[2:51:45] ottermatic69: you need some good speedfarming to even be able to have the mats for bosses
[2:51:51] miniath_: most players will spend 90% of their time just farming
