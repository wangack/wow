[0:26:00] xiClutchBoyix: Something that you have 100% control over, and creative freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want, will never be comparable to a 9-5 working under constraints
[0:26:02] jocko____: @funkisthis they do complain. CEO and Executives just don't complain often or much at all to the open public. They keep it behind closed doors with a selected audience
[0:26:03] Mo23458: You gotta let the hair go with that macdonalds hairline

[0:26:49] chasegapo: Yo, but what about when chat asks you to do a handstand
[0:26:49] rhaziaa: And nerds tend to be a bit more introverted, which would make streaming for 8 hours + per day even more exhausting
[0:26:54] SEVNCE: you're forgetting the part where you get to do the thing you love every day, most people dont have that privilage
[0:26:54] o0darling0o: we can just chill and listen to music xaryu

[0:29:18] Synoxin: the fact there arent any confirmed new servers for it mean the eco is still screwed once you hit 60, people with full gear and enchants can still power level sf players

[0:32:23] abiduel: that's cap
[0:32:25] Logic0311: they should've added a few things to SSF, like achievements @Xaryu
[0:32:25] Kazunya_Meowryu: Im not sure if it was because Payo is sick, but yesterday he was being negative towards SoD saying its a dead game and that wow lives off waves of hype unlike other games, he said he feels like streaming wow is killing his stream, Did you have any input on this? Thank you <3
[0:32:26] CosminRBK: no way
[0:32:26] MeleePiper: no way
[0:32:26] surgento: asmon is a reacta streamer
[0:32:27] Smitana92: cap
[0:32:28] taylorsdank: if asmon plays theres 10k players at least
[0:32:29] ohioliving: biggest lie
[0:32:30] yarrpeter: Yea no way
[0:32:30] Grocery7: depends how much blizz pays him I guess
[0:32:32] PhinmaN: Cheer100
[0:32:34] shadowstorm_sod: 100% just streamers and the followers can't help so there is no reason for them to simp and play
[0:32:35] pimpdaddyping: Ssf and hc in general isn't friendly to me due to limited time available to play sod p2 is for sure my go to
[0:32:36] JinX4mdi: I find it troublesome also that people now "Know" what to do. For instance, back in the days, pvp came very natural out in the world on classic vanilla, but once pvp was released on classic, there were armies of raid parties just  camping contested borderlands, that was not the case back in the day
[0:32:37] Caledvwych: Explain briefly selfound?
[0:32:43] abiduel: asmon hasn't done a single thing by himself in wow in years
[0:32:48] JukezZA: wait Asmon playing self found makes sense since its the only way to play without the spergs
[0:32:49] coastalhappiness: @mackearns U just make shit up rofl

[0:33:01] Saiauriel: I'm not playing hardcore SF if Sodapoppin is not playing
[0:33:01] Grillelise: what is self found hc?
[0:33:02] boromoro1997: both
[0:33:04] LordBambii: @Kazunya_Meowryu every game goes through phases, there are metas on twitch on popular games, but he only plays one game which also has its waves of popularity
[0:33:05] boromoro1997: BOTH
[0:33:09] Xeonik11: hey does anyone know if you actually need 45k from rank 3 to rank 5? cause my ranker says ill be rank 5 but need more for the 40%
[0:33:10] coldyair: Asmon was talking about last epoch sf not WoW

[0:33:47] manithebunny: i play retail :D
[0:33:47] Ddocz: 69%
[0:33:48] bonyato: why is ssf not a on a fresh realm ?
[0:33:49] gongoflex: havent had the motivation to play sod phase 2

[0:34:03] peahness: you should be able to unlock all professions on hc ssf so you can make bronze tube, enchanter rods, etc
[0:34:04] aparssss: @Xaryu if you play, in what server u will play?
[0:34:04] bigwilly3737: sod is boring as hell to watch
[0:34:05] Kiryza: Agree
[0:34:06] jude0487: I'll watch but not play for sure lol
[0:34:08] kleardeath: I will watch, but with the limited time to play I cant restart every death
[0:34:11] Fungdork: uh, why would it worry you how many people play self found, when teh point is that it's a solo game. you can be the only player and it's fine
[0:34:11] bribri22222: Kappa
[0:34:12] Hibernia24: Exactly
[0:34:12] naynayayx: peaple dont wanna play SF becouse is not fresh realm

[0:34:13] JukezZA: wait Asmon playing self found makes sense since its the only way to play without the spergs
[0:34:13] MrPankratz: hell ye
[0:34:16] Logic0311: They litteraly spent 5mins "creating" SSF HC. Why not adding at least a few achievements
[0:34:18] EnTroPY_42: dropping frames
[0:34:18] shadowstorm_sod: It's great for YouTube!
[0:34:19] Kazunya_Meowryu: Im not sure if it was because Payo is sick, but yesterday he was being negative towards SoD saying its a dead game and that wow lives off waves of hype unlike other games, he said he feels like streaming wow is killing his stream, Did you have any input on this? Thank you <3
[0:34:22] Eggzactly54: Good Morning Good Sir
[0:34:24] 19ozzy92: watching hc is the best
[0:34:24] largist_: your BG music sounds kinda wonky today
[0:34:26] nezt1: hardcore is fun to watch for sure, miss grays and kargoz streams, so much vanilla <3
[0:34:26] CamGG__: some sod, some last epoch
[0:34:27] bryn_dee: Since it is never too late to start HC, I think it will get back the hype as SoD P2 levels out
[0:34:28] ohioliving: i hope people mass report the lazy ones getting boosted in ssf
[0:34:38] garlonadred: if you played SF, what would you play? didnt you say rogue a while back?

[0:34:49] LordBambii: @Kazunya_Meowryu lol viewers are hopelessly addicted and hate themselves haha.  but yeah i think he would have to branch out to do variety and become more of a personality streamer. which he could be but he'll prob seen an initial dip in viewers

[1:04:02] Gosu_Rival: Undead PVP
[1:04:03] Peschke9: how we doin Brother
[1:04:08] daijahaden: Uncoordinated zerg rush attack without healer support, is the best form of defense
[1:04:08] Breakfist_: human racial is BIS
[1:04:08] DerkMerkins: horde has almost always been better at pvp overall
[1:04:08] B_Rize: 25% stun resist is just insane

[1:05:46] Ranzorx: sell reddit asap
[1:05:47] ShinerG: whats IPO mean?
[1:05:52] cookie_jayy: Alliance was only better when humans had the trink racial

[1:06:48] Necrosizz: Like 3.1 or 3.2 iirc
[1:06:53] Ranzorx: id rather quit reddit than potentially lose money irl cause of reddit LUL
[1:06:59] SillyPanda: Reddit is just gonna get squeezed for cash like every other public company. Quality will go down
[1:07:03] dizzypeezy: u even watched world of roguecraft?
[1:07:04] madabber_: @Xaryu reddit only has one thing to offer and thats your information. they will start PUMPING ads on reddit once public

[1:08:28] phyosen: Rickele is probably the bottest of them all
[1:08:36] Deathbloomzx: mad bots in hillbrad rn
[1:08:36] Pilky02: that's only one layer aswell

[1:08:43] Seoken1: so the crazy thing is, they also offer boosting services, with the same exact message @Xaryu
[1:08:43] Knocktoff: i counted 4996
[1:08:46] Frostlicious: thats at max 200
[1:08:49] Zacrilioth: how does that guy have 4.2k mana as frost
[1:08:50] TheShazamMan: Yeah, this is one layer too lol
[1:08:52] ColePowerz: could be multi boxxing also
[1:08:52] Rindu: i wanna say atleast 12
[1:08:54] 7thSaga: LUL
[1:08:55] Liloxcj: what are they doing there??
[1:08:59] auuzib: Problem is when they ban them they have a new account up in 30 minutes or less
[1:09:03] trxxx: this happens every single day at stocks
[1:09:05] thisisgoodcontent: 6am those bots should be asleep
[1:09:17] baelz: they are not encouraged to do this
[1:09:21] baelz: gms told already
[1:09:23] flawless_jv: Too much work kekw
[1:09:25] subsonic_eye: When you spam stocks as a reg player you gotta vendor you get so much junk
[1:09:25] kleptomaggs: game masters used to whisper you
[1:09:26] cookie_jayy: LUL 󠀀
[1:09:28] bandage2: noway a bot  can do all this now ?
[1:09:30] surgento: imagine hiring a gm LUL
[1:09:30] BeeMcG: The GM should just lift them up in the air and if they keep running theyre bots
[1:09:33] Ayomeer: if there is one guy that get's banned falsely there's gonna be a shitstorm yea
[1:09:34] kiirkey: Hey Xaryu,   Was wonderring how you tab target when you have bound nova for tab? :D
[1:09:37] succaw: i was waiting to see my gnome running through LUL
[1:09:40] Ranzorx: ironically banning a lot of bots makes them more visible when they reroll
[1:09:46] Gosu_Rival: I've been watching AH at specific times through the days; I have found AH crafting bots maxing bag space and having runners come unload them and run it to the bank/mailbox. Figured the threshold of pricing on specific items.
[1:09:53] baelz: yeah... but i do agree with you, it just got 1 gm to be there and watch that shit show hahaha
[1:09:54] tquidtv: I got banned for sending 100 gold to myself

[1:10:01] Loodimus: Does sleeping bag have a min level? trying to boost my alt and for some reason I cant use the bag :C

[1:10:11] ChristoxCrousT: i got banned for buying gold
[1:10:13] reborn2win: @Xaryu Do you think Blizz is allowing this to kill the game slowly? Just getting as much money out of it until the game is dead?
[1:10:14] Kazunya_Meowryu: @tquidtv thats funny i did the same thing and didnt get banned!
[1:10:16] tquidtv: Im not lying lol

[1:10:24] Tee__Gee_: heard that a few times now
[1:10:24] Burym: W blizz
[1:10:25] Buffoncete: imagine a GM banning manually bots and being unfortunate to ban real person, the repercusion of this
[1:10:26] PERALES19: its because he bought the gold
[1:10:26] Fungdork: I like to drag horde bots into the middle of refuge point in arathi so they can't spawn far enough from guards
[1:10:27] Loodimus: Does sleeping bag have a min level? trying to boost my alt and for some reason I cant use the bag ?
[1:10:29] PERALES19: been happening to alot of ppl
[1:10:30] fetza108: liar KEKW
[1:10:30] hutchyy917: obv a lite
[1:10:31] Seoken1: probably different Bnet ID
[1:10:31] miciahclay: I've mailed gold back and forth a lot, but don't have two separate accounts
[1:10:31] st4ckz8: someon in my guild got ban for recruiting in chats.
[1:10:32] GH0STtdi: to many people have been banned for trading and sending gold to their alts
[1:10:32] hutchyy917: lie
[1:10:33] CFGs27: A lot of ppl were
[1:10:33] Trav_Where: One of my guild mates allegedly was mass reported in a BG for not having a mount and got a 14 day ban
[1:10:34] auuzib: Ive heard that a few times man
[1:10:35] curv6: ive never gotten banned for buying gold
[1:10:37] B_Rize: A lot of people are getting banned for no reason with Blizzards new automated system
[1:10:39] succaw: isnt there a way to see the pathing of bots? like if its the same cycle compare to a natural player just grinding
[1:10:40] JukezZA: isnt having 2 accounts against tos anyways?

[1:10:55] frederikv225: KEKW
[1:10:55] subsonic_eye: Automation gets lots of people banned I think
[1:10:58] taylorsdank: LMAOOO
[1:10:59] AxiomDK: I just got off a 7 day ban for abusive chat although my chat is literally disabled
[1:10:59] clee0724: LUL
[1:11:00] Slesky: @Xaryu why don't they make an invisible "wall" that can be passed through in the direct path to stockades...This wall will "Flag" players who go back and forth between vendors more than X times in a day. Then they can inspect those players by filtering only mages and just mass ban based on that
[1:11:00] taylorsdank: SO TRUE
[1:11:07] madabber_: Blizzard needs to ban the bots
[1:11:07] Gunnan22: both can be true
[1:11:07] Seoken1: hahahah
[1:11:09] hxrtge: mate of mine just got a 7 day for gold buying lol

[1:11:11] Kazunya_Meowryu: Blizzard knows your alts on your accounts,
[1:11:12] ThisGuyisLocal: stay
[1:11:16] Jehl703: Did you send 100g to yourself? Ordid you buy 100g on your 2nd account and trade it to your main account? lol
[1:11:16] AxiomDK: and then got an appeal with literally no response from a real player
[1:11:16] Joewrx: iv been banned for gold buying twice
[1:11:16] hxrtge: about 2-3 weeks ago
[1:11:17] madabber_: i showed up to my farming spot last night bam 4 bots own it
[1:11:17] LoganHawkTV: WHAT IS THAT HAIRCUT??? where is the Chad Xaryu Cut from wayy back????
[1:11:18] p_fet: @Xaryu seeing WoW go thru the same thing osrs has been going thru for a long time is funny. Get ready for people who were "wrongly banned" posting on reddit and astroturfing with other fake reddit accounts
[1:11:18] provender_: You should have to pass a CAPTCHA test before goin into Stockades
[1:11:19] Astralthundr: Astralthundr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[1:11:19] Henry_Ash: @Xaryu I have sent hundreds this weekend between my 2 accounts and no ban
[1:11:21] swolygh0st: gold buying is at all-time hgh

[1:11:27] hajanatorator: I also have been banned for a week and they showed me no reason :D
[1:11:30] Riji07: the thing is if u get wronfully banned i have ppl i know just contact them and they get unbanned
[1:11:31] Slesky: @Xaryu why don't they make an invisible "wall" that can be passed through in the direct path to stockades...This wall will "Flag" players who go back and forth between vendors more than X times in a day. Then they can inspect those players by filtering only mages and just mass ban based on that
[1:11:32] PERALES19: these servers would be daed without gold buying
[1:11:34] Soulmangos: @Kazunya_Meowryu these are people who use alts on different accounts
[1:11:37] kindaopmusic: mass reporting happens in cod all the time when people get owned. Sadly the cheaters made everyone look like a cheater
[1:11:40] AxiomDK: @Xaryu Its not like they just fired 1900 people from blizzard
[1:11:41] baelz: LOL
[1:11:45] wigglybob: As a poor 40 disc priest, I do not have thick enough skin to join AB lol
[1:11:51] Ayomeer: That's because they have too strict a system in one area and a too lienent system in another. Both absolutely can be true
[1:11:52] ClassixxApex: i got banned for logging on a different computer lol
[1:11:56] Erwincrates: RIP BOZO

[1:12:13] daijahaden: I got banned for starting a gnome supremacist guild and holding a rally once. It's rough.
[1:12:14] dycegamer: @Xaryu It's confirmation bias. No one knows how many bots get banned. But they do know if them or friends get 'wrongfully' banned. So no way to compare.
[1:12:18] AxiomDK: @Xaryu Nah bro these last 3 weeks have been different
[1:12:24] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Soulmangos yea still same thing, battlenet sees the pc you are using
[1:12:28] Seoken1: I got a suspension right around Christmas, I was in Silithus watching the bots farm the high level mobs (exploiting), and I think they mass reported me lol
[1:12:31] AxiomDK: You got no idea what your talkin about your out of the loop
[1:12:33] swolygh0st: @xaryu gold buying is at all-time high
[1:12:35] handy_grenade: i thought about gold and i got banned

[1:12:40] wanieki: Lol the Graycen voice was perfect
[1:12:46] SoSoBurrito: I'm on audio only, did Graycen just get banned? xarHUH
[1:12:46] p_fet: @Xaryu seeing WoW go thru the same thing osrs has been going thru for a long time is funny. Get ready for people who were "wrongly banned" posting on reddit and astroturfing with other fake reddit accounts
[1:12:49] tquidtv: True
[1:12:53] cabo_chris: just ban the bots! bot account are using stolen cc info. but blizz wants that stolen $$
[1:12:58] NAT0_141: @xaryu Ahmpy last night was saying SoD has lost its hype and doesnt as popular anymore. Do you agree?
[1:13:05] bloodsnaill: soda bought gold on stream and wasn’t banned so why would you get banned for it?
[1:13:05] dycegamer: Enablers
[1:13:06] Seksiviiksi: no you
[1:13:07] notBlakelol: @Xaryu got a ban on an account that hasn’t had a sub in months 🥲
[1:13:07] baelz: yesd
[1:13:08] PERALES19: they want ppl to pay 75g for a mount and not buy gold
[1:13:08] JukezZA: honestly the GDKP ban was a W change
[1:13:10] kindaopmusic: atleast GDKPs are gone, right lol
[1:13:10] g0dzilla: @kleptomaggs thats the worst excuse ive heared so far lol
[1:13:11] batchestspam: my friend got rightfully banned for buying gold
[1:13:12] cookie_jayy: you too?
[1:13:13] Grocery7: not wrong
[1:13:14] Maiqthehighking: Never bought gold never will
[1:13:16] Slesky: WOAH WUT
[1:13:19] littlewicked420: Do bot lives matter?🤔
[1:13:19] Slesky: You buy gold?!
[1:13:21] griefie01: no
[1:13:23] AbyssReborn: no
[1:13:28] B_Rize: gold buyer for life
[1:13:30] SatanicAngelBlazed: People make more gold per hour at work than they do in game so they buy it
[1:13:31] KingQueenAce: Everything is inflated because bots tho @xaryu
[1:13:31] baelz: hahahaha]
[1:13:32] purplewingedboa: I traded my friend 90 gold for his mount. He payed me back a week later. No ban yet...
[1:13:33] pymmax: blizzard employee here - I pretty much just randomly select 5 people a day to ban to keep my job

[1:13:42] MrSchneetzel: hell no
[1:13:44] enigmasvea: i just bought 100k CaughtIn4K
[1:13:45] cabeshpash: lol
[1:13:45] Erwincrates: What I find so unfair is when they ban all the guildmembers of a guild when only 2 or 3 members were doing illegal things
[1:13:45] Knocktoff: every time you say dont buy gold i buy 100
[1:13:46] bloodsnaill: GDKP ban completely killed pug raiding or made gdkps shadow raids. so far looks like sod raiding has died
[1:13:46] baelz: I agree
[1:13:46] clee0724: i have a problem buying gold Sadge
[1:13:47] soup_kup_: u cant take gold then either

[1:23:08] kleptomaggs: theres a reason era is 99% GDKP now - nobody wants to deal with the logistics of organizing 40 man raids with no compensation. SOD will have the same problem but with GDKPs not being allowed everyone will just quit except for a few guilds

[1:34:05] Loodimus: err I mean cath boost
[1:34:05] nodoh420: Bots are still everywhere. It hasn't changed anything
[1:34:05] Gashunk1: you can do everything with just a few hours, but not parsing
[1:34:06] Scar_LA: raid consumes aren't cheap
[1:34:08] pandasux: no point to buy gold in sod at all
[1:34:09] LyteKrame: What sucks is the quest dont give nearly the gold they did in phase 1.
[1:34:10] Vertigo_GB: Quests give so much gold though. Made 100 - 150g just doing quest for lvl 32-38
[1:34:12] Danzolicious: 100%
[1:34:13] Gunnan22: Hasnt improve the game
[1:34:16] MaavR6: the amount of gold we need is def farmable in a short time though
[1:34:19] Ayomeer: sure, but increasing the friction on buying raid gear is a W
[1:34:20] fetza108: gold farm as a melee Sadge
[1:34:22] dylont707: no gdkps yet everything costs as much as when they were relevant
[1:34:26] punchit04: punchit04 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! yo
[1:34:27] demotiiviert: saw more bots now then p1
[1:34:28] g0dzilla: i think it didnt effect gold buying directly... i think it just made it easier for blizzard to enforce the gold buying... cause its harder to hide it
[1:34:30] ralphh1541: crafted helm costs like a 1/3rd of what it cost 2 weeks ago
[1:34:34] Bytefish: what is the punishemnt for gdkp?
[1:34:34] iamabirdttv: i farmed all the gold on my credit card
[1:34:34] king___slender: Some dipshit in world chat yesterday said there's no healers cuz they banned GDKPs
[1:34:35] YzieGG: - 20 LVL KEKW
[1:34:41] GrimGrimGrim: 70% of sod player is gone
[1:34:41] windatar: USD to gold is half what it was week ago. So demand has fallen off after Gnomer 3 day change.
[1:34:42] koldhanded: why ppl that are buying not BOTS ???
[1:34:42] pandasux: you just quest for some days, and have a lot of gold
[1:34:44] Xeonik11: gold for talent change is so annoying when we are suppose to be dicovering man
[1:34:44] ShootinBlanx: I think they cracked down I bought some and got 2 week suspension
[1:34:48] dylont707: 75g to swap your trinket ?? how does this make sense at all
[1:34:48] MrPankratz: BAN EM
[1:34:50] leroyrobenson: Instead of banning just empty their wallets including gold they didn't buy lol.
[1:34:50] ScryerTV: You just start bann some, rest stops to buy ofc
[1:34:51] koldhanded: THEY SHOULD BAN BOTS
[1:34:53] CwyLoL: worth it

[1:34:54] koldhanded: NOT PLAYERS
[1:34:54] Muovipotilas: BAN ALL GOLD BUYERS
[1:34:58] MaavR6: ban 5% send a message, lowers the number and repeat
[1:35:03] baelz: dont ban them at the same time. start banning ppl for doing it
[1:35:06] krimsin360: They're doing really good now on gold buying, instead of 3 days they are perma-banning and the turnaround on bans is like 2-3 days not a month
[1:35:08] Bytefish: from business standpoint it's no brainer to keep gold buying
[1:35:09] incognito_enjoyer: People who complain about the amount of gold is the reason why everything is instant gratification model. It's not that hard to farm some gold and everyone wants everything instant
[1:35:09] baelz: and you'll create a fear
[1:35:09] kindaopmusic: they just need to make it easier somewho to make gold for dad gamers
[1:35:09] ControversyTV: ban bots to make gold more expensive and reduce gold buying that way
[1:35:10] Giorgio_69__: just sell gold in game like albion online does I'd say
[1:35:10] jazzyjoff: You can only indirectly conclude that. And by my judgement items on the AH are still beeing sold and bought way over the true value. That could be that rich ppl are now buying everything on the market but more likely is that ppl are still buying gold
[1:35:14] bchamp93: I saw someone on crusader strike trying to sell pendulum of doom for 4000k lol. who organically has that much gold
[1:35:15] jiggsawpuzzlemanes: It's so strange to see xar with this haircut
[1:35:18] fetza108: zenene ne ne nee
[1:35:18] sullyman13: that's very likely the case. blizzard has data scientists that figure that stuff out on revenue

[1:52:45] bloodstuck2000: Honestly that was one of the best WoW videos I've ever seen
[1:52:46] ehweron: @slapshotsd they are a different kind of people from the average wow gamer, especially classic and the "old" blizzard fanbase.
[1:52:55] Karismus: thealg8QualityShift thealg8LeahPrideMore thealg8RoseRoe
[1:53:03] vaniteaDH: ye

[1:54:42] Karismus: I was 90 years at 5 savixKEKW
[1:54:59] incognito_enjoyer: Nah, there were adults that played games like us back then. Generations have changed. Everyone wants everything instant. The older generations weren't like that
[1:55:00] math1as333: solo games feel so boring
[1:55:03] brumstool: 20 year old game, almost 2 generations
[1:55:06] Soarlozer: also a bunch of mmo features got picked up by the other genres
[1:55:06] Pirivan: Well and WAY more entertainment options competing for our time.  There are “forever” games that are not MMO’s.  LoL, DoTA, CS, Fortnite, Destiny, etc.
[1:55:07] Grocery7: just p2w everything since we have more money and less time
[1:55:09] Mel0ns: thats why phases in SoD are perfect, you want classic, but dont have the time. Phases gives people time to catch up
[1:55:13] drummond777: thats why retail feels so zoomerish
[1:55:13] doubledeadly69: what you think bout hell divers 2
[1:55:23] Rindu: adults that played game back then played tetris and pong lmao
[1:55:29] atomicblonde_pr: wow needs to star working whit real engine 5 remaster all
[1:55:29] iStrudderz: retail sucks aware
[1:55:36] 尸口尺口丂升力2548: @Pirivan Fortnite, Destiny LUL

[1:55:45] unik3v2: why u look yonger ?
[1:55:45] Mased49: so true
[1:55:47] MongoSecurity: retail sucks now and I am sad
[1:55:53] palac105: current gen is instant grat only not so much that only older players have no time
[1:55:57] Bytefish: just dont selep
[1:56:00] CwyLoL: thats why there are multiple games
[1:56:02] Karismus: kwispy11Confetti kwispy11Confetti kwispy11Confetti kwispy11Confetti
[1:56:04] vaniteaDH: I feel like the fact of how easy retail is, is what ruins the game, you can literally 1shot almost every mob you come accross
[1:56:06] iinthebushes: xar podcast when?
[1:56:08] itsmistero: Aware
[1:56:11] Gashunk1: exactly, the is some major lag
[1:56:15] Karismus: @iinthebushes THIS!!!!!!!!!!
[1:56:15] twistedbinkz: retail is a dumpster fire
[1:56:15] coconutoz: tell that to larian studios
[1:56:16] Gashunk1: re
[1:56:18] Shreddingly: whos time do you respect by removing the leveling part? if you would make the leveling part meaningful, you would respect it
[1:56:18] blorphmachine: Well putt
[1:56:19] Craester: Maybe I am alone with this but classic leveling is not that fun and takes too long IMO
[1:56:19] sokinsz: i blacked out
[1:56:20] Pixiepantss: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:56:22] incognito_enjoyer: Nah, there were adults that played games like us back then. Generations have changed. Everyone wants everything instant. The older generations weren't like that
[1:56:25] pastadactyl: What about gated tier skips, like you need to pass a class user test before allowing tier skips LUL
[1:56:27] S1RVEL0: I agree.
[1:56:27] Karismus: XAR PODCAST kwispy11Bongo !!!
[1:56:29] Mel0ns: thats why phases in SoD are perfect, you want classic, but dont have the time. Phases gives people time to catch up
[1:56:30] FamSisher: WoWs problem is they do not bring in the new generation
[1:56:30] Pixiepantss: uuuuuuuuh
[1:56:32] iStrudderz: retail sucks aware
[1:56:33] Nerzoth: well, new wow expansions, besides, I guess, Dragonflight, a much more time consuming then vanilla-tbc-wrath
[1:56:33] Erwincrates: yes Xar
[1:56:35] Pirivan: @linkinparkfhritp Hah I know, but people do play those as “their game”.  CoD, heck even Minecraft too that people just play as their “one game.”
[1:56:35] omwtwopluto: No matter all the changes blizzard has never been more successful than 04-09
[1:56:36] CwyLoL: KEKW
[1:56:39] MightyJoeBong420: I play wow classic because i know the game inside and out and can compete with the tryhards without extreme time investment
[1:56:39] MongoSecurity: I miss my old wow...
[1:56:43] bigwilly3737: true
[1:56:45] biglake_11: THAT is true
[1:56:50] try_weii: @Xaryu i think wow has not changed and adapted like it should have
[1:56:53] taylorsdank: they were like that they just didnt understand the extent of how fast they could get things
[1:56:54] themadfeltcher: you're right, my old guild mates and RL friends, who I played OG vanilla with, are still playing retail and refuse to play classic in any way shape or form.
[1:56:58] budmodeos: RuneScape has same issue!! OSRS is great, no $60 pass. RuneScape 3 is shit, has a $60 pass.
[1:57:00] dulgr_1: @Xaryu The boosted xp from BFD hopefully stays around in future phases and continues with Gnomer.  Better way to speed leveling up and respect people time.
[1:57:04] RealitySuks: You have great credibility and a solid thesis. 100% agree
[1:57:10] BCboy_: half the people in the video saying “wow is back” dont even play the game is a bit misleading edits
[1:57:11] Bytefish: helldivers 2 LUL
[1:57:14] Pixiepantss: listening
[1:57:17] Pixiepantss: ASK
[1:57:22] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu MMOs have been on upswing past few years(that are being developed atm)

[1:57:32] doublerekt1: Reset
[1:57:32] skittlespls91: more simplicity
[1:57:33] Redhairpirate13: can't honestly
[1:57:33] Arthannis: reset the game to much in it
[1:57:33] Phranchyze_RIP: @xaryu thats why a game like dark souls, elden ring were so popular, it brought back challenges
[1:57:34] blade23master: time
[1:57:34] themadfeltcher: My old friends are still playing, but just Rretail
[1:57:34] chikuto_art: better story
[1:57:34] brumstool: not much

[1:57:37] bigwilly3737: nothing
[1:57:37] Erwincrates: there's nothing that would take me back
[1:57:37] drummond777: they alwayys come back
[1:57:38] YermGames: i personally think being adult gives me more time to play
[1:57:38] duckus91: Free time
[1:57:38] Bakes00: nothing, not enough time
[1:57:39] densegod: Classic wow is the only version that was fun
[1:57:39] shupaz: time!
[1:57:39] jbeemerks: typical corporate decision making. cost/benefit (profit) analysis out weighs good game play.
[1:57:39] mtthw4l: redo the game.. start over.
[1:57:40] Volryn: Yup
[1:57:40] Lenzaloca: Timeeeee
[1:57:40] crixx111: good community and fair play
[1:57:41] tiltlit: @Xaryu not having 3 kids of my own lol
[1:57:41] JayyyRS: true
[1:57:42] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu SoD made me come back
[1:57:42] chalupacabras: Blizzard needs to make a new product. A new MMO, or REALLY lean into Classic+
[1:57:42] Xronik07: WOW2
[1:57:42] Ubmsx: nothing
[1:57:43] Ryso33: i think a lot of it is close friends not playing having time
[1:57:43] fondufilms: no job
[1:57:44] itsFrost11: for sure
[1:57:45] dennisbooker: Housing ..it is
[1:57:45] Saturos47: so stop catering to them
[1:57:45] IamSam93: If it was free and I didn't have to pay
[1:57:45] aluskyy: a thanos snap would make me come back
[1:57:45] Spl1ker: who said housing KEKW
[1:57:45] Frizankbeast: All of my homies would have to come back. The social aspect was the best part.
[1:57:46] Brothergunns22: My friends
[1:57:46] mtthw4l: WOW2
[1:57:47] iinthebushes: take me back to 2010
[1:57:48] chalupacabras: Stop working on WoW, give us something new.
[1:57:49] Threeliters: 34 hour day
[1:57:49] hot_souffle: RETAIL SUX
[1:57:49] Waxppc: Don't have time to play
[1:57:49] Elsevier86: WoW is far too much of a timesink
[1:57:49] amruta_ray: right - not enough freetime
[1:57:49] fearsomebd: yes
[1:57:50] haptic_g: 2019 classic relaunch, but thats in the past
[1:57:51] Ubmsx: 2 much work and chores :D
[1:57:51] In_Stillness: Mounts at lower levels
[1:57:52] Seronem0: People with less time should not be the ones to focus on. WoW requires time, that's what makes it what it is
[1:57:53] pistolvania281: nothing
[1:57:53] Greencrackx: there’s nothing
[1:57:53] 7thSaga: i Love Retail and i gave classic a try only to Lvl33 and went back to retail
[1:57:55] mello_yollo: all of my friends came back for classic but then stopped by tbc
[1:57:58] MrStLouis68: need a wow halo crossover tbh
[1:57:58] tsbcolin: If I win the Lotto and dont have to work anoymore @Xaryu
[1:58:04] smashdakeys: I think I am done with Wow, I recently decided to no longer buy the next expansion and put it down. After so many times I have just been disappointed too many times.
[1:58:05] trxxx: SoD made me and my friends come back and we quit at the end of wrath
[1:58:06] Greencrackx: E X A C T L Y
[1:58:06] Karismus: I cancelled my sub. Probably wont come back ever. :( Until... savixKEKW
[1:58:07] RollTide751: A new job with a lot less time at work is why I've come back, otherwise it would be nothing
[1:58:08] emmie_h: What about those of us who leave and come back
[1:58:09] Greencrackx: priorities change
[1:58:09] Fujinator: @Xaryu Your chat and other classic streamers are also a cause of troubles in retail atm. you are a classic streamer so you got a classic audience and this automaticaly makes them hate retail. I still play both and both games have merit and after 20 years I still lean towards retail as my most fun game due to the difficulty being more challenging.
[1:58:10] Pixiepantss: i switched from retail to classic KEKW
[1:58:10] Breakfist_: theyre playing god of war on the ps5 for 45 minutes a week
[1:58:13] Bytefish: Theres nothing we can do
[1:58:15] Shajaa: @Xaryu Dude I tried to get my 9 year old into SoD with me...he got bored and wanted to play fortnite again by level 10 lol.
[1:58:18] atomicblonde_pr: me i dont play anymore almost like 3 years because is the same engine and charasters dragon sucks so bad
[1:58:19] tommyayo: They need to make WoW 2
[1:58:22] doubledeadly69: sod 40 boost with mount and I’m back BOYS
[1:58:23] C137Getschwifty: i can give an answer to that they started selling shit u could only earn threw achivements and actually grinding it out to just be thrown in the shop was a big fuck u to alot of people
[1:58:23] themadfeltcher: I was about to quit, and then they announced SoD, and in the meantime I tried hardcore
[1:58:24] apexariestv: do like ptr server all max lvl and gear no bots needed
[1:58:24] tommyayo: and I would no life
[1:58:24] brumstool: makes leveling hours worthless if you can just buy it
[1:58:25] Reaperz_kinetic: @fujinator that’s just not true
[1:58:25] amruta_ray: i remember leveling more than I do, the end game raiding
[1:58:26] tsetse2fly: @7thSaga When you say classic do you mean 2019 classic or SoD?
[1:58:27] malefic918: Moat ppl say the sub
[1:58:28] emmie_h: but I will never go back to retails
[1:58:28] jbeemerks: wow is fun because of the investment and dopamine fix for your time.
[1:58:29] Redhairpirate13: nothing can, watching you instead when I get some time off @Xaryu
[1:58:30] Karismus: savixKEKW kwispy11Confetti
[1:58:31] aluskyy: lmao classic
[1:58:32] bigwilly3737: lmaooo
[1:58:34] Moogrins: Game requires too much of a commitment. More responsibilities, less free time
[1:58:36] apexariestv: same haha 😂
[1:58:37] Shreddingly: Intriguing storyline with a great gameplay loop where it is interesting to discover the world. Basically elden ring
[1:58:38] Seronem0: Why 60 boost 10 characters instead of playing one for real... idk man
[1:58:39] omwtwopluto: Zoomer mentality
[1:58:40] Karismus: Fortnite is actually fun lmao
[1:58:41] emmie_h: yeah my daughter will never play wow with me
[1:58:42] pmakewow: @Xaryu do you think there will be a hardcore self found mak'gore tourny?
[1:58:42] budmodeos: RuneScape 3 made same mistake. Pay to win on 3, no pay to win on Old School version
[1:58:44] 7thSaga: @tsbcolin  when it first came out lol
[1:58:48] NotASkiller: we love fortnite we love fortnite
[1:58:49] Redhairpirate13: for me at least
[1:58:50] flapjack1010: also so many versions of the game it splits up the few friends you have thats play the game
[1:58:51] apexariestv: Roblox is killing the young to try to learn wow
[1:58:55] Fujinator: @Reaperz_kinetic it truely is, if you watch retail streamers they will hate on classic
[1:58:57] themadfeltcher: I was bored in retail, stopped playing, went to cancel sub, saw SoD, played HC and had fun, now playing sod
[1:58:58] chrislu18: Your youtube videos brought me back tbh lol I hadn't played since WoTLK
[1:58:59] ZonaGravy: aye haircut lookin 🔥
[1:59:01] drummond777: cant get my 19 year old brother into classic because its too "slow and boring." he plays retail
[1:59:02] el__thorno: it's difficult to jump back in and come up to speed when surrounded by people with 10 extra years of sweatiness
[1:59:04] bryn_dee: I let my kid fish for me on SOD he thinks its cool but gets mad when he cant see any actual fish in the thunderbluff pond
[1:59:05] leiferikson4541: I just got a AG1 add lol
[1:59:06] palac105: @Xaryu The real problem is the requirement to show ever increasing subscription numbers that wallstreet forces on game companies
[1:59:08] 7thSaga: @apexariestv tagnCHEERING2 Roblox!
[1:59:09] Pixiepantss: probably right?
[1:59:10] WorldStar_WoW: I could listen to you talk about this all day. super interesting @xaryu
[1:59:11] try_weii: @Xaryu can i join you in discord?
[1:59:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @seronem0 because the way the game is played in retail has shifted from the game starts at level 1 to the game starts at max level
[1:59:13] Bytefish: probably
[1:59:14] apexariestv: haha 😂
[1:59:17] bigwilly3737: @Karismus stop that the game was fun in 2018 when everyone wasnt building a sky scraper on top of you now everyone is sweats
[1:59:20] doubledeadly69: they need to make it free to play no subscription and bet people will play more / come back
[1:59:20] jbeemerks: start kid on Pokémon. the grind will prepare them for wow
[1:59:20] el__thorno: SoD helped because it brought a lot of people back to square one, to come up to speed together again
[1:59:21] ZimmyX: It does somewhat work for me, I just get burnt out really quick. The community isn't the same, that's why I liked classic. Feels lonely. I love playing with others and actually communicating. Buuut, all my friends quit. @Xaryu
[1:59:25] Kazunya_Meowryu: @Fujinator yea we are just sheep, I have to check with xaryu to see if he approves
[1:59:26] MightyJoeBong420: my 6 year old daughter cleared SM GY herself at lvl 35.  I've never been so proud
[1:59:26] fyeefyee: fyeefyee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! thanks for the good content lately Xaryu
[1:59:28] Bakes00: is SSF going to bring back hardcore?
[1:59:30] wahedje: yo xar! how can we get more info about the OTK tournament? Love
[1:59:30] tuna_sandw1ch: we all know who controls the money
[1:59:37] peahness: no fresh server for ssf hc made me lose interest
[1:59:37] Ubmsx: @Xaryu where did Mitch go :(
[1:59:39] Karismus: @bigwilly3737 I only play no-build!!!
[1:59:42] takuutv: takuutv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! much love dude thanks for watching!
[1:59:44] Genghish: Jorge
[1:59:50] Reaperz_kinetic: @fujinator it’s not tho… they give their honest opinion whether that’s negative or positive is up to their opinion… plus you act like EVERYONE just automatically agree with streamers and some do but not most
[1:59:52] Seronem0: @Reaperz_kinetic But getting max level is still 10x faster than in classic. Why would we need boosts
[1:59:52] vaniteaDH: its okay
[1:59:55] 7thSaga: tagnLEO tagnRAPH tagnMIKEY tagnDON
[1:59:55] theartisanmtga: I recently found your youtube, cant stop watching your reacts!!!

[2:00:08] TheKelsur: I quit in 2008, I played from release until then.  My 11 year old daughter saw a RaV video on youtube of all things and asked if she could play world of warcraft, right around when SoD came out.  I said sure, bought her an account and she quit after three hours because she doesn't like WASD movement and I relapsed and here I am.
[2:00:09] demotiiviert: W
[2:00:10] Erwincrates: W
[2:00:10] deathbykeegs: w
[2:00:10] Karismus: @bigwilly3737 Yes its really fun I hate the building also
[2:00:10] Nerzoth: well, new wow expansions, besides, I guess, Dragonflight, are much more time consuming then vanilla-tbc-wrath were if you don't count leveling
[2:00:12] C137Getschwifty: get rid of phases and stop selling stuff in shops that took others months to grind out boom solved
[2:00:13] Ryzehx: W
[2:00:13] Reaperz_kinetic: @seronem0 you’re not wrong but because money unfortunately
[2:00:15] taylorsdank: @takuutv actually insane dude you deserve way more views
[2:00:17] peahness: have you done your sons of hodir dailies
[2:00:19] Xronik07: S tier video
[2:00:20] Ryso33: interesting how things are getting more solo and self-found within social games
[2:00:24] Fujinator: @Kazunya_Meowryu in some way this is true, if someone you watch has an opinion and his chat fuels that, your opinion will be influenced too
[2:00:25] Pixiepantss: HHAHAHAHAHAAH
[2:00:25] 7thSaga: LUL

[2:00:42] hemm22: i dont play because i used to have so many close friends playing every night. no chance they all return. SOD idea was good for nostalgia, but we realize we miss the friends not the game.

[2:00:48] takuutv: @Xaryu haha visit the UK and i'll show ya
[2:00:48] Shreddingly: But honestly, what you are pointing out is also why SOD popped off.  People don't have that much time to level so having the level cap at 25 made the game appealing to so many returning players who could take part in the "end game" content without having to open their wallet to buy a 60 boost

[3:45:39] nofrontin: what does it matter, it's a game about loot and you make the group anyways so you can choose people that won't need your items LUL

[4:09:55] Pixiepantss: the 1 shots are annoying thats it
[4:09:57] icylemons1993: you can taste 60
[4:10:01] Udenwo: phase 2 is way better, but the min makers finished all the content in one week and are board.
[4:10:03] xodd2: can you show/ link your TMW for arcane blast?
[4:10:04] H_9_K: I think 4 phases is too much. Should have been 25-45-60
[4:10:06] themadfeltcher: depends on the raid/pvp
[4:10:08] erousagi: p2 is better designed but p1 was fully uncharted while you already have expectation for p2
[4:10:08] Ayomeer: Maybe BRD is the raid :)
[4:10:09] poyohub: youre getting edged at 50
[4:10:09] KingQueenAce: nah thatll make it better imo
[4:10:10] SippinSimpSyrup: @infernaldogg ive eared ever lockout easily…..
[4:10:13] stamets: first half of BRD should be allowed tbh
[4:10:14] Xolosoz: shame no AV tho that phase since it goes open at 51
[4:10:15] TheTastyRamen: I hope p3 will be short
[4:10:16] jnuts10: Whats the raid at 50?
[4:10:16] PhoenixPresence: @H_9_K W take
[4:10:18] Shajaa: I think SM raid at 50 tho
[4:10:20] ybadmind: 50 should be 40man raid 🙃
[4:10:21] JeffMich09: @xaryu what's the next raid you think? ST?
[4:10:22] Shajaa: that'd be big pog
[4:10:22] username_kev: @Xaryu or chat, which addon shows the mobs debuffs above their nameplates?
[4:10:22] wilkeys: wilkeys subscribed with Prime. 
[4:10:23] baril47: the lvl 50 raid should help that tho
[4:10:25] taylorsdank: if the raid is better then gnomes 50 will pump
[4:10:27] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: 60 has got to be more than just a single phase right?
[4:10:28] Ervill1: phase 4 needs to be lvl59 4Head
[4:10:28] The_B4nished: Any predictions for 50 cap raid? im assuming sunken temple
[4:10:28] rpl_1337: SoD is fun but I feel like maybe they took it too far and made players a little too powerful
[4:10:32] MrStLouis68: just kill it 4Head
[4:10:34] Catalystic_Sudo: tank and spank
[4:10:35] NormanBates420: i got my mount, and got rev with AB, i don't have anything to do besides raid and i can't afford an alt

[4:16:06] EnigmaticHD: 99% of these people don't actually no. Why ask
[4:16:06] jimmy3legs: Last staff that'll drop this whole phase

[4:16:07] 1cyveins: YEP
[4:16:09] askebischoff: its second bis
[4:16:09] Duckduckgoose38: BFD one still biS for boomkin
[4:16:09] Bambambm: @Xaryu It 100% is BIS for healer druids. If you're NOT a mage healer, its not even that good. its literally the SAME as Kelris staff..............................
[4:16:10] KingQueenAce: YEP
[4:16:10] jawwshhh: THAT IS COPE
[4:16:12] malefic918: Nature Yes arcane no heals
[4:16:13] ThrokkTheWarrior: boomi does arcane dmg

[4:16:15] xNotorietyx: its fine, who cares
[4:16:15] ratlash: i think chat should bully that druid into giving that staff to Xar
[4:16:15] alexgoat94: disgusting horde music
[4:16:16] sswhurtado: yes
[4:16:17] prismo5: its fine for druids to take lmao, its a heal staff they put arcane dmg on so mages can also use it
[4:16:19] Erbsosa: DRUID SUX
[4:16:20] xOutcoldx: its 2nd bis for most ppl the 1h oh combo is always better like always
[4:16:20] calamirlol: BIS for DRUID HEAL is dagger and NECRO GNOMICON
[4:16:22] emosoda: hyper copium
[4:16:22] gregfork: It's so bad for Xaryu. Xar doesn't channel regen, +healing does nothing for beacon healing.
[4:16:23] Erbsosa: CAP ON DRUID
[4:16:23] iExco: iExco subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 3 month streak! next time for sure
[4:16:23] Saturos47: really its a hunter staff so they can feign death res
[4:16:24] Pixiepantss: o i lied
[4:16:27] Trav_Where: as a resto druid it depends on what you're looking to do. some druids go just heals, most of us are doing damage also. as an resto druid DPSing, yes its second BiS
[4:16:28] Erbsosa: DRUID SXXXXXX
[4:16:30] youbbaba: better than kelris staff for pvp by a lot
[4:16:31] Nokkz91: ppl forgetting druids do arcane damage
[4:16:32] leiferikson4541: main hand off hand is bis for resto druids

[4:16:35] Catalystic_Sudo: that hurt my soul chat
[4:16:37] msewell1717: 1h mace and healing offhand is better
[4:16:37] soup_kup_: i mean ur staff is good
[4:16:38] TocaRed: you should ask your brother jokerd to ninja staff
[4:16:39] Rybeon: What is your BIS?
[4:16:40] CodeRedOG: Streamer loot is streamer loot, smh you gotta use your priveledges
[4:16:42] KosmicDevil_: @Nokkz91 right?
[4:16:42] zoxxicc: DRUID GIVE XARYU THE STAFF, SHOW HIM THAT UR A REAL FAN xDDDD
[4:16:44] ImtherealJohnny: rip the staff
[4:16:47] SippinSimpSyrup: +healing only benefits direct healing home boy
[4:16:47] Gosu_Rival: Q.Q
[4:16:48] madabber_: BIS IS ROD FROM BFD IM DEAD
[4:16:50] jawwshhh: @baril47 Imagine ninja looting as a well known player, on stream, in front of thousands of people
[4:16:50] ImtherealJohnny: arcane mage prio tbh
[4:16:51] TocaRed: KEKL
[4:16:51] Xolosoz: @prismo5 think since healing mage is new this staff that is new created loot is probably designed for healer mage ;p
[4:17:00] ImtherealJohnny: im off, gn fellas<3
[4:17:01] KosmicDevil_: druid earned staff fair and square they should not have to give it to xar
[4:17:08] baril47: @jawwshhh well asmon used too all the time lmao
[4:17:09] Pixiepantss: awe :(
[4:17:12] lukemeleney: you def can
[4:17:12] Cyhero: do it
[4:17:12] neighbor220: i think most groups woulda gave it to mage
[4:17:14] Nappycans: yes you can
[4:17:14] Flightz5508: Rich get richer
[4:17:14] EvuNoob: u could ))))
[4:17:15] Erbsosa: nah he a clown
[4:17:15] Diezy: why no spell damage aura from lock
[4:17:16] Dracobringer: @Xaryu you could change the loot threshold to Rare for masterlooter, then you wouldn't have to manually roll off green boes or the salvage
[4:17:17] Pixiepantss: thats very sweet of him QQ <3
[4:17:18] cookie_jayy: Druid letting chat gaslight him LULW
[4:17:18] FateIRL: Are you playing self found hardcore

[4:17:30] Lioni1994: stfu chat. let the man decide
[4:17:31] Catalystic_Sudo: b o p
[4:17:32] gregfork: @SippinSimpSyrup He doesn't channel regen, I don't underrstand why he thinks the staff is so good for him. It's literally just +11 stam for Xaryu, Rod of The Ancient Sleepwalker is actually better for PvP too.
[4:17:33] TokerTy420: yes if hes tank
[4:17:33] lazmage123: dont take it off him
[4:17:35] foam52: but he's not the main character in this raid
[4:17:35] sighwarlock: if hes pact
[4:17:36] batchestspam: druids are so chill
[4:17:36] mini1mage: someone tell me that arcane blast stack counter/timer addon plzzzz

[4:17:37] Ervill1: @Erbsosa and we dont care what u say so theres that
[4:17:38] realpurpleblaziken: wow xar with morals W
[4:17:38] maniiieelll: its not his second bis, its really bad for him
[4:17:38] curv6: its such an arcane mage healing staff though
[4:17:38] Jinjzo: bis where ? its useless for druid ...
[4:17:39] xNotorietyx: why get all the gear, then you'll never raid again
[4:17:39] oTrentx: @Erbsosa ?
[4:17:39] 1cyveins: @Catalystic_Sudo t r a d a b l e
[4:17:39] SippinSimpSyrup: @baril47 imagine using that degenerate as an example
[4:17:40] Bambambm: @xaryu If you're NOT a mage healer, its not even that good. its literally the SAME as Kelris staff.............................. That staff isn't even 2nd BIS for dps mage....
[4:17:42] Mindhun7er: Xar what talents u use ?
[4:17:43] claenxx: xar, you gotta do /roll in CAPS
[4:17:45] twixduo: @Xaryu PLS SORRY TO ME <3

[4:17:50] running_backing: ERMMM ACKCHTUALLY WHY ISNT HE USING THE RUNE I WANT HIM TO USE??
[4:17:51] Meanpandah: jesus chat is ruthless
[4:17:52] levikee98: No cap i really do think this 1-10 rolls f-ing ur rolls up man… Since u do these rolls u literally didnt win any rolls @xaryu
[4:17:57] Elsevier86: Druid should keep it. build up karma for dagger
[4:18:00] irlEric: when he trades u the staff give him 50g n see if he gets banned for gdkp
[4:18:02] leiferikson4541: its bis for mage healer not for resto druid
[4:18:03] Trav_Where: considering you reserved items that are not your BiS, i would not let you have the staff. thats just me though
[4:18:04] Nateypww: just bring ‘em to the next run ez
[4:18:05] youbbaba: @Bambambm I think Xar wants the 15 extra stam
[4:18:07] Turkeypitz: the staff isn't great for druid due to lack of +damage
[4:18:09] baril47: @sippinsimpsyrup I was just saying I respect Xar for not ninjaing because not everyone would do the same lol
[4:18:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @levikee98 thats not how it works lol
[4:18:14] leiferikson4541: according to zockify
[4:18:15] istinklikepoop69: things not good  for druid lol
[4:18:17] mini1mage: why not collect 10 salvage and give one to everyone
[4:18:17] Fotbee: what is BIS for mage if not this staff? @Xaryu
[4:18:20] leiferikson4541: mage healer
[4:18:24] leiferikson4541: not mage dps
[4:18:24] Upcomin: @Trav_Where he reserved items which are BiS tho? :D
[4:18:25] Reaperz_kinetic: @ballerdeluxe yes it is LOL
[4:18:29] iFakeyTV: Warlock do not run spell aura unless they are helping someone else parse I guess.
[4:18:30] Diezy: lock can give spell damage aura with a rune for bigger parses
[4:18:30] youbbaba: @Fotbee the epic mainhand and offhand
[4:18:30] Catalystic_Sudo: @1cyveins ty
[4:18:32] PocketLotion: it’s xar s fault for rolling a 16 KEKW

[4:18:39] espi: dagger + tome
[4:18:41] SippinSimpSyrup: @baril47 my apologies, saw out of context then
[4:18:43] rxr407: blue staff is best
[4:18:44] DRDENNISPHD: watch the dagger drop and the druid is going to need it because its BIS
[4:18:45] Blu_Phoenix: yep
[4:18:46] Unvoiced_: Just got my bis dagger
[4:18:47] realpurpleblaziken: is the epic 1h sword from shock boss better for pally or rogue
[4:18:49] curv6: i need that on my spriest
[4:18:50] Stingin: Bis for mage is dagger and uldaman offhand
[4:18:51] levikee98: yes it is… @reaperz_kinetic u gotta believe in it
[4:18:52] SnugsBunny_: gizmo dagger bis for healers and dps casters.
[4:18:53] Reaperz_kinetic: @ballerdeluxe it is literally bis for healer mage
[4:18:54] kleptomaggs: dagger + mana OH -> swapping mana OH for tome when on cd
[4:18:55] jullibjar: WHAT DO THE WENDING MACHINE DO ?
[4:18:57] RageTry: dagger +  necro is bis same for druid

[4:19:19] Reaperz_kinetic: @ballerdeluxe are you sped? lol that staff is bis for healer
[4:19:22] Klups: have you finished the ulda quest
[4:19:24] maniiieelll: what is he wearing right now?
[4:19:27] baril47: @sippinsimpsyrup all good I agree with you I said asmon only because he is the shitty example of who would ninja
[4:19:29] redyboi: @jullibjar Quest
[4:19:30] cyabrotv: a streamer that actually allows others to roll on stuff huge respect
[4:19:31] classygamer17: any hunters in chat that can help me? is melee hunter the best right now for gnomer? seems like i see no more ranged hunters
[4:19:38] Cuddle_Bunz: staff esthetic is bis
[4:19:40] TocaRed: druid get high chance to join raid ?
[4:19:46] Stingin: Correct
[4:19:46] spredenett: @stoprelax he has 2 items on HR
[4:19:46] Meanpandah: that was clearly a hunter staff
[4:19:51] hou1001: Yes
[4:19:51] DRDENNISPHD: @classygamer17 yes melee hunter has the highest damage output of hunter specs
[4:19:54] gregfork: @Xaryu, +healing literally only benefits your DIRECT heals. +healing doesn't affect beacon healing. The staff isn't that good for you.
[4:19:54] d4ngling: what quest is that
[4:19:55] Erbsosa: kick droods
[4:19:56] xNotorietyx: @classygamer17 yes, ranged hunters dont even get invited
[4:19:58] mostlikelyyadad: did you get the drop you needed grom vicious fallout?
[4:20:03] espi: mace + healing offhand for pure resto, dagger + tome for resto damage
[4:20:06] ballerdeluxe: @Reaperz_kinetic ur just wrong, idk what to say
[4:20:06] classygamer17: @DRDENNISPHD thanks !
[4:20:07] Reaperz_kinetic: @ballerdeluxe LMFAO you ever think cause oh idk.. it hasnt dropped LMFAO
[4:20:17] Reaperz_kinetic: @ballerdeluxe youre using false logic... youre wrong but its all g
[4:20:22] Sgt_TBag: now you have to reinvite them next raid so they don't roll on your staff LUL
[4:20:24] classygamer17: @xNotorietyx thanks ! time to repec
[4:20:46] brandogzz: Yes meele hunter is 3x better than ranged bro

[4:20:58] batchestspam: he deserves it then
[4:21:00] TocaRed: well if no one want druid not he got more chance to join raid with good stuff ok
[4:21:00] xNotorietyx: @infernaldogg doubt it
[4:21:07] lukemeleney: feels like a good drop run though
[4:21:15] marre_88: you using mass regen?
[4:21:15] Muckbot1: Im so sorry Xar. Curse that 16
[4:21:17] Bambambm: 100% Equally as good for a Druid as it is for a Mage. One should not get preference over the other. Both 2nd BIS.
[4:21:26] brandogzz: @xNotorietyx CAP 400 dps xdd
[4:21:29] Diezy: ask lock about the demo rune that gives spell power to group for parsing. should give like 20 sp dmg
[4:21:32] frostyfreshmn: any tips for a first time wow raider? kinda nervous
[4:21:33] twixduo: @Xaryu 440 GS ITS ENOUGH TO GNOMER ???

[4:21:52] cookie_jayy: its just a big dungeon LUL
[4:21:52] Duckduckgoose38: watch your feet!
[4:21:54] Upcomin: but you didnt reserve dagger right? @Xaryu about to lose it with another 16 KEKW
[4:21:58] iFakeyTV: @gregfork It gives arcane damge. So it is a healing staff for mage
[4:22:00] soyboywolk: panic... just dont try raiding
[4:22:04] dombobble: watching a quick vid is always good
[4:22:06] Ervill1: good luck with that, 99% people expect 99 parse not fun
[4:22:07] sushicomet: i lvld a warrior to 40...what a mistake i made lol. Should i lvl a priest or warlock now chat

[4:22:13] Maiqthehighking: HUH
[4:22:17] dombobble: watch a vid on mechanics YEP
[4:22:17] batchestspam: xar wants gizmo for stam in pvp anyway, fuck that pve staff
[4:22:17] soyboywolk: its too hard..choose a different game
[4:22:18] hickey7979: @sushicomet lock
[4:22:18] sbaldwin9__1: after dual wield rune nerf whats best melee hunter wep?

[4:22:26] Lokarno: Our guild hasnt cleared it in 2 attempts, LUL People shit talk us but we have fun, zero fucks given
[4:22:29] Upcomin: but you didnt reserve dagger right? @Xaryu about to lose it with another 16 KEKW
[4:22:30] 13brill: cleared twice with casuals
[4:22:30] gregfork: @iFakeyTV It gives the same SP as rod. it's literally just +11 stam for Xaryu. If he was actually healing it'd be different, but he's just putting beacon on
[4:22:31] lichskunk74: Dont do it, goto the bar
[4:22:32] BE_OH_WHY: explain the bosses
[4:22:36] Cross86: don't get knocked off Xar
[4:22:38] ChopAfterRollin: Good luck finding a vasual group.  Everyone wants 6/6 1 hour runs

[4:22:39] poyohub: yea but youre a streamer
[4:22:42] vegasdismay: not true
[4:22:45] Trav_Where: @Upcomin irradiated robes is his BiS, which is not the power depleted chest
[4:22:49] jackpepsimba: Gnomer isnt half as hard as the community makes it out to be. Ive cleared with three warrs in group
[4:22:50] alexgoat94: they wil expect you to be 6/6 even if you havent completed the raid yet
[4:22:50] djr3mix: can you get the bfd buff at 40?
[4:22:56] deskjob_: NATTY RAIDER GIGACHAD
[4:22:57] Kersed805: or find a guild with a casual raiding experience. lots of really cool people out there who wont flame for mistakes
[4:23:00] CodeRedOG: He went through all that work to type that and still get banned lol
[4:23:02] Snor_Snup: hard to find a pug who is also willing to go blind tho
[4:23:03] ImThatFella: Yeah Zar found all the mage runes just by chance insane
[4:23:04] Upcomin: @Trav_Where well its not, since he farms gear for pvp, he gets the other set :)
[4:23:05] Psyphin808: FeelsBadMan Ozzy
[4:23:05] TokerTy420: watch his feet you should put @Xaryu

[4:23:11] iinthebushes: @djr3mix no
[4:23:14] blueberyz: @djr3mix no you can no longer get the buff at 40 and it falls off if you already have it
[4:23:15] baril47: @djr3mix no BFD buff at 40
[4:23:20] lolo40001: Tell me with a straight face u can tell the direction of this boss
[4:23:22] fijimann: @alexgoat94 ya i cant get a group since i had surgery and got to 40 late, seems everyone requires 6/6 and raid logs
[4:23:29] Upcomin: @Upcomin but took you quite a long time to look that shit up just for being super wrong :D

[5:54:19] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[5:54:26] Lobbemate: FIX TO LAYER ask Them to logout 1 min and come back
[5:54:28] realandtruephobe: I kind of wish the whole event was solo FFA
[5:54:30] Ohni14: are they ever going to fix this?
[5:54:34] b1azzuris: im so glad i no lifed to hit 40 and get my tiger mount in a week before the lag became unbearable. Havent stepped foot in there since
[5:54:34] keweiy: because why not benefit it while you can?
[5:54:57] williwhite94: might be FPS i found a good YT video that shows how to get your FPS from 60 to 120+
[5:55:05] Lukeker: @b1azzuris exalted arathi is the real stv grind
[5:55:10] bruhy04: they really need to fix the layer/lag situation. its basically unplayable
[5:55:14] Moogrins: any gnomer loot?
[5:55:15] williwhite94: ahh kk !
[5:55:19] TransMutedMaya: try downloading new RAM
[5:55:21] Loodimus: Hes got a starforge pc cmon bro
[5:55:22] MONNlBLAST: @keweiy hot garbo for mages u rather want epic dagger and mage quest offhand anyway. its only for boomkin pvp and other healers until they have mace+offhand. the staff is just hot garbo ''epic''
[5:55:23] b1azzuris: @Lukeker nothing for me there as a boomkin Sadgre

[5:55:56] ScryerTV: Yeah poll it
[5:55:56] thejiggler1: Please do
[5:55:58] PhoenixPresence: you were so hype about it
[5:55:59] GIenQuagmire613: im not lol
[5:56:01] Zacrilioth: i did the arcane explosion strat at alter this morning and got 1200 coins
[5:56:03] priestialityg: people who wanted to play SSF already played it, self imposed
[5:56:03] LueDawg: Nova Instance Tracker tracks your coins per event now
[5:56:03] keweiy: hwatever bro
[5:56:05] AfroManHamro: would be fun for the downtime on SoD
[5:56:09] Xuroz_: Horde or Ally for SF?
[5:56:12] istinklikepoop69: you should, not much else to do on sod
[5:56:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @MONNlBLAST i 90% parse but how does that even matter LMFAO
[5:56:13] infuze27: it was just what you’ve always been waiting for!
[5:56:14] lukemeleney: man, it's a pretty tight stream schedule: STV -> Gnomer -> STV
[5:56:20] infuze27: just bad timing with sod
[5:56:21] w9ak: Are you planning on playing Cata Classic? :) Cata was a pretty nice PvP exp
[5:56:28] Reaperz_kinetic: @MONNlBLAST youre just mad im calling you out on BS
[5:56:32] Zoismoe: stream will do great either way. play what you want and we will be here bro. The players will be on SSF also and youll probably start the wave @Xaryu
[5:56:35] stubell22: I’m going for r1 cata
[5:56:40] namelessthree: I dont see how you can play WoW after HC its so boring
[5:56:41] amarv: shouldn't you just aoe constantly there?
[5:56:42] stubell22: my first r1 was cata warrior
[5:57:00] infuze27: keep it for transmog

[5:57:04] Zacrilioth: and missiles
[5:57:06] LilTaisu: the healing only affect direct regen healing
[5:57:07] SurrealAndre: you can try it with spellfrost bolt buff incoming
[5:57:09] hobosam87: he gave you the staff?
[5:57:13] infuze27: missle procs are huge with barrage
[5:57:15] LilTaisu: +healing is bad for mage
[5:57:16] RacecarRemedy: weapon macro staff swaps
[5:57:19] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[5:57:22] Zacrilioth: benefits spellfrost bolt and missile procs
[5:57:30] lylo_tv: Aware less people playing
[5:57:35] amarv: arcane explosion?
[5:57:36] xEAS10: yeet
[5:57:41] SurrealAndre: theyre supposedly buffing spellfrost
[5:57:53] Zacrilioth: its not a buff, theyre just fixing the crit chance
[5:57:53] DlLDUCK: Aware
[5:57:54] calamirlol: SeemsGood SeemsGood
[5:57:55] willcantstream: that is true
[5:57:56] infuze27: true lol

[5:58:09] Magris: @Xaryu so i tried to join your group but you said i was on a different realm. can you not play with ppl on different realms?
[5:58:09] snygglejf: haha no need to fix
[5:58:17] huckleson: idk how people are still playing sod tbh
[5:58:22] Pixiepantss: xarCringe
[5:58:26] marvinmc420: i mean i dont enjoy playing when it lags this much its 2024 wouldnt expect a game to lag this much
[5:58:40] williwhite94: i was JK lol
[5:58:40] Melkor_Active: Why are people quitting sod?
[5:58:40] huckleson: its the same playerbase honestly
[5:58:44] Zoismoe: stream will do great either way. play what you want and we will be here bro. The players will be on SSF also and youll probably start the wave @Xaryu
[5:58:46] dombobble: @marvinmc420 exactly
[5:58:49] lukemeleney: doesn't Helldivers have the same server issue?
[5:58:49] Vandracon: helldivers 2 is goood

[5:58:55] Magris: well poop
[5:58:56] fxv_3: It's the FOTM game, so it's grabbing audiences from everywhere
[5:58:56] LueDawg: Is living bomb not part arcane part fire dmg?
[5:58:58] Marcotekk99: nice haircut bro u look so much better
[5:59:01] mangocat40: with this lag best bet is go 5 mage and aoe the altar if u wanna get alot of blood
[5:59:02] sajuto_: people are just done with sod for the most part and raidlogging
[5:59:04] infuze27: might as well be able to on sod too imo
[5:59:04] Whalechill: cata classic comes out in 4 months
[5:59:12] Zielepoot: hardcore content is great though
[5:59:26] huckleson: I seriously cant wait for cata, its gonna be so fun
[5:59:26] rawlexdota: Instead of this event they should have done another BG like stv BG or something, much better,
[5:59:29] lukemeleney: the phase 5 wipe in Gnomer was great content
[5:59:48] epgkrispy: What was your skill tree for arcane healer?
[5:59:49] kaizen421: @huckleson Kappa
[5:59:54] Zacrilioth: incoming stream snipers

[6:01:21] nderalvarez: have u tried 5 mages, mass regen and ae in altar?
[6:01:23] Zacrilioth: which feels better, ice lance or living bomb?
[6:01:26] cmilly1025: Hey chat anyone find a way to get your party back on the same layer I've tried reloggong reloading etc but nothing seems to work 100% of the time
[6:01:42] PhoenixPresence: broken
[6:01:45] killthedemon12: lul
[6:01:46] Reaperz_kinetic: @Zacrilioth bomb
[6:01:48] sajuto_: you guys are just running and healing lol
[6:02:23] Ayomeer: nothing is dying NotLikeThis
[6:02:34] sajuto_: not focusing one target :(
[6:02:40] Daracus98: true
[6:02:44] the_teleporter: wisdom
[6:02:48] The_Awoken_One_: The_Awoken_One_ subscribed with Prime. 
[6:02:49] Reaperz_kinetic: the event is so scuffed
[6:02:56] sureshot1193: so guys how is phase 2?
[6:02:59] beastnephew3: anywhere we can see that talent set up you were running for gnomer? damage was insane
[6:03:13] H4zeey_: H4zeey_ subscribed with Prime. 
[6:03:14] cmilly1025: I think p2 is great
[6:03:23] HuffDaddy: call me baby again Kreygasm
[6:03:23] Breakfist_: what did she bring u?
[6:03:26] Catalystic_Sudo: that’s a fat L
[6:03:32] grimxav: are you still in a raid group?
[6:03:37] FIREMAGZZ: half of SOD quit because of phase 2. look at numbers
[6:03:38] GIenQuagmire613: phase 2 is sick
[6:03:40] grimxav: maybe thats why so littl eblods
[6:03:41] cmilly1025: Wish they didn't lock letherworking branches tho
[6:03:44] grimxav: bloods
[6:03:45] PhoenixPresence: dayum imma go make a protein shake
[6:03:47] FIREMAGZZ: sod will never recover from p2
[6:03:47] Octagon3: does frost do good dmg in pvp?
[6:03:48] Kukosan: wife keeps farming the Ws
[6:03:52] realandtruephobe: did you prefer no lag but less people or lag with more ppl?
[6:03:56] Rammers: it would be good if it worked
[6:03:57] RokiBN: azzcrac
[6:04:03] Yamamoto78: i think if next phase has a raid like uldum or karazhan crypts something new tons of ppl will play
[6:04:05] hollawalah: pretty sure only 40s give blood
[6:04:07] JacquelingTV: I must be the only person who enjoys retail more, well except for gatekeeping endgame content.
[6:04:09] jkuup: @Xaryu he wasnt flaged so you dont get blood
[6:04:09] radicalvlad: D:
[6:04:13] Ayomeer: gotta get taht 0 blood KEKW
[6:04:20] foolsendit: no you got one blood
[6:04:22] aerodynam1c: god fucking damn that haircut is sick
[6:04:24] petethemyth: no its not true
[6:04:26] DovLumbridge: Is the killing blow for blood ? or participation in the fight
[6:04:27] Zoismoe: false
[6:04:28] jkuup: @Xaryu he was opt out
[6:04:31] petethemyth: even lvl 20s give blood
[6:04:36] Zoismoe: no he wasnt @jkuup
[6:04:40] schnick3698: im at 909 blood
[6:04:41] foolsendit: you had one blood he gave you one
[6:04:48] Zoismoe: dont talk if you dont know
[6:04:50] rns_aurelius: @cmilly1025 they said theyre gonna make the specialisations more meaningful. As an ele shaman im just regretting not going tailoring
[6:04:53] kaizen421: i feel like p2 lost some of the nuisance that classic pvp had
[6:04:55] ARROOCE: @schnick3698 its capped at 255 KEKW
[6:05:06] kaizen421: SOD in general actually
[6:05:08] JoetheGrimm: are those wyyman blueberries ?
[6:05:08] jkuup: @Zoismoe he was check the vod he was horde so he could kill. opt in have sword sign
[6:05:25] Zoismoe: bro... the kill literally gave him a blood
[6:05:30] Zoismoe: KEKW
[6:05:32] jkuup: nope
[6:05:33] Zoismoe: what are you on about
[6:05:35] keweiy: yes i agree as well
[6:05:36] jkuup: prob a bomb that died
[6:05:37] Reaperz_kinetic: @schnick3698 we al know youre lying..
[6:05:40] jkuup: players give 5 blood he got 1
[6:05:42] deeclan1: @Xaryu make the video quality alil better, the red shit in the distance is ugly, not so nice for the viewers
[6:05:43] lejtan1: What runes is he running
[6:05:48] marvinmc420: its fun but not when it lags like this
[6:05:49] mtnboo: like the hairdo bro
[6:05:49] istinklikepoop69: we need arenas in p3 or p4 why wouldnt they?
[6:06:02] keweiy: hoping that they will turn down the knob once full life cycle of the sod is complete and lead to classoc 2.0
[6:06:03] huckleson: @JacquelingTV I agree with you. I just hate dont like dragonflight aesthetic. Give me cata
[6:06:11] rodavlasilad: my friends are calling this “retail minus” lol
[6:06:12] FIREMAGZZ: I would LOVE sod arenas but the dev team can’t handle it
[6:06:29] huckleson: Sod is just a mess to me, quit before p2 cant take it seriously
[6:06:47] Zielepoot: arena is anti calssic
[6:06:48] JacquelingTV: I like WoW for the gameplay if anything, the endgame. Accomplishments, if you will.
[6:06:50] kaptenknuckles: what do you get from pvping or is it just for fun?
[6:06:57] Genghish: Arena kills wpvp
[6:07:00] huckleson: they added way too many stupid abilities instead of content
[6:07:08] RushedFuq: damn that gnome looks fast af
[6:07:15] Avlrex: Any tips to make some gold and  how to play arcane? first time mage
[6:07:19] Reaperz_kinetic: @huckleson kinda an L take because thats all retail is
[6:07:23] istinklikepoop69: @Genghish wpvp is a joke as it is
[6:07:23] Pragma8123: aoe classis def have an advantage in farming coins
[6:07:25] Eyeshield5: @huckleson ya, feels more like retail with all thse new abilities and shit
[6:07:26] macjcool: when you pan sear a steak in a cast iron, are you lighting that bad up to hi heat or med high
[6:07:38] Genghish: @istinklikepoop69 ye and im laughing
[6:07:41] Gorkmuk: is stv event still laggy?
[6:07:43] huckleson: @istinklikepoop69 literally wpvp in classic is so trash, idk how people like it. generally because they are bad at pvp i think
[6:07:43] subsinx: how’d gnomer go?
[6:07:45] Slickk34: I was with a mage who did flame strike and spammed from a distance, worked so well
[6:07:50] horrorzm2: @Xaryu Have you ever Mountain Biked in Arizona?
[6:07:59] hersheyjh: are you gonna play supermarket simulator?
[6:08:15] reallyeric: wtf
[6:08:16] HawaiianSpaceLasers: LUL
[6:08:18] kaptenknuckles: what do you use coins for?
[6:08:20] istinklikepoop69: @huckleson yea man kinda hard to enjoy playing 1v5 xD
[6:08:25] WildeThornberry: happened to me yesterday a lot. also had 2 min rez times
[6:08:33] Slickk34: never seen that lol
[6:08:36] Catalystic_Sudo: what doing after this?
[6:09:08] RushedFuq: yoo xaryu i just got the style goggles from gnomer =)
[6:09:15] istinklikepoop69: @Catalystic_Sudo bgs
[6:09:18] macjcool: you have to moo at him
[6:09:57] Melkor_Active: @xaryu XAR YOU CAN DRINK AND EAT UP WHILE YOU HAVE THE DEBUFF
[6:10:00] Reaperz_kinetic: lagging like crazy
[6:10:03] Lucbass: https://clips.twitch.tv/ScaryVastDadKappaClaus-FWjrthJpxfVE6fSw
[6:10:12] pmanfit91: Is this your last day of STV, final thoughts?
[6:10:17] shortsandpants: I feel like were here with you sitting in your room
[6:10:23] nderalvarez: mage orb?
[6:10:33] Dobronx8: 39 raiders from Dobronx8 have joined! 
[6:10:40] reallyeric: where do you buy pvp gear at?
[6:10:41] suhdude90: what bracers and what trinekt
[6:10:43] Genghish: Yo does melee have to kills bombs too on last gnomer boss?
[6:10:45] mlarssonxd: how do  u buy honor?
[6:10:57] sm3ed: or layering
[6:10:58] dombobble: KEKW
[6:11:07] Gorkmuk: I play on a low population server and it's super fun
[6:11:16] Skaxxx: it was lag-free for like one week idk what happened
[6:11:19] nemcoy: i think 3 ppl player party would be better with bonus honor going solo
[6:11:22] ginjakk: on wild growth no lag.... but also a pve server so meh
[6:11:28] DlLDUCK: everyone quit plz Kappa
[6:11:30] pmanfit91: That's one of the reasons I didn't stay on the Druid after giving you the port. Healing with HoTs is hard enough. Healing with HoTs and server lag.. it's not enjoyable.
[6:11:32] PhoenixPresence: Thats sad you have to say that
[6:11:33] realandtruephobe: tbh, we shouldn't be this far into the phase with this much lag in the flagship event
[6:11:34] KairuruTV: people quitting right now with the population we have, legit doesnt matter
[6:11:36] chillingdyylan: Can tplay as a warlock because i cast drain life and it says targets not in range
[6:11:39] gmazca: not a great business model lol
[6:11:44] Shreddingly: until a certain point.
[6:11:47] lukemeleney: there's a bell curve
[6:11:47] adam_brisbane: wont they just remove more layers so the same amount of people will be on your layer?
[6:11:53] Sp00kedEu: until there’s is no 1 to kill
[6:11:54] FIREMAGZZ: sod lost 200,000 players cause of this crap
[6:11:56] Shreddingly: you dont want to be looking for people for 15 minutes
[6:12:00] drummond777: im just hoping they do something tomorrow
[6:12:00] Chrisjumper1996: are you gonna play HC again ?
[6:12:01] Turkeypitz: on server pop with 500ish - STV plays well = just feels bad with an empty world
[6:12:06] Dobronx8: STV lag is so crazy. was fixed for a bit but now is pretty bad
[6:12:20] Dobronx8: I would love to see someone get a group of 500 to kill the boss
[6:12:27] mitchello85: indeed
[6:12:37] Asaf1s: 2019 AHAHHA
[6:12:45] cabeshpash: are u gonna go back to enshrouded?
[6:12:55] Gigglez_Beastmode: There was more issues with New world than server lag
[6:13:01] BlownFuse_: this event has turned to absolute trash.
[6:13:07] Lucbass: I had to reroll on a smaller server in 2019 LUL
[6:13:32] mrbluesky1337: we wiped out the alliance on our server 2019 :<
[6:13:42] Lucbass: @mrbluesky1337 faerlina?
[6:13:48] miazma1: @Xaryu sod warrior waiting room
[6:13:50] mrbluesky1337: @Lucbass eu
[6:13:50] sgrubber: How many coins do you average per event
[6:13:59] SmashTheDude: how's dark and darker going? @Xaryu
[6:14:00] realandtruephobe: I remember how fun the first few stv events were when basically no one was 40 and there was no lag
[6:14:29] schnick3698: im at 1513
[6:14:32] Brothergunns22: do you think pplwill play the event in p3 and p4?
[6:14:34] chillingdyylan: since lag most i get is 300
[6:14:45] rpkxnoscope57: why would they keep it like this still
[6:14:48] Fifaskilzz1: how are mages in pvp in phase 2?
[6:14:52] auuzib: tHe LaG iS bEtTeR xD
[6:14:53] nderalvarez: u can ez farm with 5 mages massregen and spam ae in altar
[6:14:53] batchestspam: lag never goes away now that they removed a bunch of layers
[6:14:54] buster2437: billion dollar company btw
[6:15:01] Pr0fan1ty: aoe farm with a group of mages during the lag is the way to go
[6:15:02] BlownFuse_: why the fuck have they not addressed this. it blows my mind
[6:15:02] gavinc110: sheesh thats low numbers, i dont think ive had less that 1.3k in the past week or so, up to 2.5k easily
[6:15:14] chillingdyylan: Iliteraly kill people and dont get credit as well somtimes
[6:15:15] realandtruephobe: why not have zone specific layers?
[6:15:17] Loodimus: Nah who cares about a dead world when you cant participate in content
[6:15:18] Caledvwych: Working event = dead world.
[6:15:23] Blaise9494: how does he make the healthbars class color
[6:15:23] gmazca: The event is required for BiS. I think zones being a bit more empty is fine
[6:15:24] mitchello85: priest and boomie grps will awlays smash it
[6:15:26] lukemeleney: did you see the attempt on kha'damu? guy got massssive
[6:15:27] sutakomet: add sharding
[6:15:29] 1cyveins: HUH
[6:15:32] Biddy_: i just sharded
[6:15:34] Vamptz: they outsource to the cheapest not the most efficient
[6:15:35] moogy_moog: lol
[6:15:41] xHinklebobx: retail open world pve is so good Kappa
[6:15:43] trmonx: retail still lags in such events no
[6:15:47] lylo_tv: i think i sharded
[6:15:51] Duckduckgoose38: Just give me back my ten layers
[6:15:53] mangocat40: as mage you just have to go 5 mages and aoe altar, hard casting with this lag is pointless
[6:15:55] BlownFuse_: I played two events yesterday and couldn’t even get on the same layer as my team. this event is the worst shit I’ve ever seen in a video game tbh
[6:15:56] FIREMAGZZ: they don’t have the money guys .
[6:15:56] eskivoart: i dont think casuals mind
[6:15:58] drummond777: sharding just for stv would be amazing
[6:15:58] Sznoob: Sznoob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Pog!
[6:15:58] ScarletPaladin: they did layering instead of sharding because people wanted the "social experience" of being on the same server as other ppl
[6:15:59] macjcool: it makes sense though
[6:16:01] CygnusC: maybe an exception is in order for STV
[6:16:02] Disidon: sharding = bad. need new pants
[6:16:06] Duckduckgoose38: I miss beign able to fish and make gold
[6:16:09] eskivoart: majority of retail players are casuals
[6:16:18] Duckduckgoose38: I had no problems during 10 layers
[6:16:18] the_teleporter: is it too hard to implement sharding in only stv
[6:16:21] revora_: 10 layers also = inflation then everyone complains again :)
[6:16:22] bryn_dee: Can someone explain what would be so bad about sharding? serious question tell me about the cons?
[6:16:26] LoosieJuice: im open to whatever lets my group of 5 be on the same layer
[6:16:31] rpkxnoscope57: theres laggy then unplayable, need a middle ground
[6:16:34] j03seph: they need to make the events spread over multiple zones
[6:16:36] LoosieJuice: im sick of 2 or 3 of us appearing and the other 2 or 3 disappear
[6:16:36] Disidon: @bryn_dee brown stain
[6:16:36] ims0mewhere: go to ironforge on reset day game is far from dead
[6:16:37] Duckduckgoose38: Honestly rather see less people then not be able to even get 300 coins because of player lag
[6:16:40] Fifaskilzz1: how are mages in pvp in phase2?
[6:16:42] Duckduckgoose38: This is super frustating
[6:16:44] AsapBarky: more layers=more rares too
[6:16:45] Melkor_Active: @xaryu Just make the bloodmoon event a battleground ez
[6:16:47] McDooglehimer: I remember back when Classic first came out, they didn't want to do sharding since it would break some of the "world kiting" stuff like teremus to SW, so it wouldn't be true to the Classic spirit
[6:16:47] realandtruephobe: unfortunately this might make blizzard consider a instanced pvp event for p3
[6:16:52] gmazca: If lag is the answer, then the event needs to be instanced
[6:16:55] danielbanks: Which stv ring do you use
[6:16:58] Loodimus: agree yeah dead world isnt great but the main content is what actually is bringing people together
[6:17:09] Bloozin: they should add hard jumping puzzles that reward cosmetics
[6:17:17] Lukeker: you can turn in at any altar
[6:17:23] boblewis13: how would u feel when u lost 80 bloods from 1 death tho
[6:17:30] aggr0crag32: try to concentrate the fighting
[6:17:32] chadbingles: or multiple loas
[6:17:36] ScarletPaladin: loa gives more blood, even if they uncapped you would still want to fight near loa
[6:17:43] booddhi: truth
[6:17:43] veccev: agree
[6:17:46] Duckduckgoose38: Doesnt fix the lag issues
[6:17:46] voidtouched_93: more loas
[6:17:49] Lukeker: You can turn in blood at any altar on the map
[6:17:49] TheBiggestDorc: Or just no cap
[6:17:49] Disidon: idk if that would change much
[6:17:50] askinforit: they should make it an instance
[6:17:54] askinforit: its terrible for melee
[6:17:54] Zacrilioth: they need multiple bosses
[6:17:56] RBackbreaker: yeah
[6:17:57] Yamamoto78: turn in spot is still a point of interest so ppl will go there
[6:17:58] Catalystic_Sudo: daft event tbf
[6:18:00] realandtruephobe: not sure it would help the lag all that much
[6:18:01] largist_: I think that is to prevent ppl camping mobs and singular kills on ,ap edges
[6:18:03] Duckduckgoose38: Will just make it more of a AOE fest. Reliving our classic AV days
[6:18:03] AsapBarky: youd still Min max and fight near loa
[6:18:06] Disidon: people still gonna find ways to AOE farm altars or spam execute or whatever
[6:18:06] LithoSlam: sounds like an engine problem. probably cant go above 255
[6:18:07] KairuruTV: kinda feel like you can just take the altar gimmick out entirely and just earn blood and it coverts to coins after event
[6:18:07] adam_brisbane: if you die with 500 you wil loose 50
[6:18:08] Catalystic_Sudo: doesn’t work
[6:18:10] Trav_Where: i don't really understand why a lower cap makes you feel like you need to earn more bloods
[6:18:11] KairuruTV: just flat pvp
[6:18:11] RBackbreaker: Maybe they could just slightly increase coin gain when near loas?
[6:18:21] Turkeypitz: wouldn't you still want to accrue blood the quickest?
[6:18:26] Mico027: the spirit res stay up 30 mins after the event ends
[6:18:28] miazma1: more you have the more you lose
[6:18:31] captain0bvious: Honestly I love the idea of all this world PvP but IDK if I can be bothered leveling from 25 to 40.
[6:18:34] res15t: you'd still want to find boss
[6:18:37] j03seph: I think they need a make multi zone events with max duo groups
[6:18:46] Disidon: make another boss?
[6:19:00] Zacrilioth: need multiple bosses to spread players out
[6:19:01] Trav_Where: ii would think a higher cap would encourage that further
[6:19:04] KairuruTV: bruh if 25-40 bugs you, classic may not be for u
[6:19:10] miazma1: @captain0bvious no worries mate ill stock boost you to 30 ;)
[6:19:14] CygnusC: play retail and pay for a boost
[6:19:16] thesack3: 40 60 gonna really suck for u
[6:19:21] Lukeker: retail andy
[6:19:23] ibetrippiin: just play mage lol
[6:19:24] captain0bvious: Yeah I'm getting that impression. Totally agree too. I like the idea of 60 being difficult to obtain
[6:19:27] Loodimus: Started a hunter alt yesteday already 24 lol cmon man
[6:19:29] Nytsongx: i went from 1-40 in 2d 6h /played
[6:19:32] sinfullfilled: lvling takes the longest out of anything
[6:19:32] sklingel: only going to get worse from here lol
[6:19:33] Zacrilioth: 25-40 took me a week... you can't invest one week?
[6:19:34] Disidon: @Xaryu what about having 2 bosses in different places
[6:19:36] Reaperz_kinetic: @thesack3 not really cause it goes to 50 first
[6:19:51] Lokarno: Takes a couple of hours a level at the most.
[6:19:53] chillingdyylan: Grinding for wsg rep is a little much tho lol
[6:19:55] Fifaskilzz1: how are mages in pvp in phase 2?
[6:19:56] cyphar007: pvp and pve should be seperated for casual pvpers. too much to farm for both pve and pvp to get gear
[6:20:03] prfssrzaddy: Took me about a week as a casual, hit 40 with 10+ silver coins
[6:20:05] Yeddamand: I play about 2 hours per day and skip some days and I'm lvl 39 now. And I level slooowly. Still think phases could be shorter
[6:20:07] thesack3: 40-50 gonna be a grind tho
[6:20:14] schraler: how much health do you have in your pvp set?
[6:20:19] xDeSoh: You can play Classic casually but you can't expect to receive the same amount of rewards as those who grind the time away
[6:20:21] chazz143: duels for gold????
[6:20:27] Noviike: you handed it in
[6:20:49] Zacrilioth: zul'farrak raid confirmed?
[6:20:53] Reaperz_kinetic: @thesack3 feel like its gonna be faster than 25-40
[6:21:15] lylo_tv: MadgeLate  I have 6 kids and 3 jobs, you think I have time to lvl? im lvl 27 right now SadgeCry
[6:21:22] BeeMcG: You wanna do some ABs? to lower honor required?
[6:21:28] thedirtylobster: @Xaryu Did you see they buffed the rewards for turning in supplies?
[6:21:33] Lunehr: What changes do you think they could do with Mages so they actually get to survive a global in BG's atm? @Xaryu
[6:21:34] Zielepoot: i'm just wondering what they are going to do at 60, as stats and dps are inflated right now
[6:21:41] soup_kup_: i thought druid got the staff?
[6:21:42] hiro25000: Damn. Just checked my logs with 3 part pvp cloth set. I had a 34% uptime on the 3set bonus (+40spell power for 10sec)
[6:21:49] magical_scientist: NotLikeThis
[6:21:50] RuskoBanane: little 5/0
[6:21:50] ibetrippiin: what is the point of doing ab?

[6:25:27] skimansr: @reallyeric i heard that too
[6:25:33] Melkor_Active: @xaryu what would you think if battlegrounds would be more fastpace like the bloodmoon event?
[6:25:34] Mobely__: anallect
[6:25:42] infuze27: you may want the gnomer enchant for parses
[6:25:50] booddhi: @skimansr fix your ears
[6:26:01] wahabohhle: bloodmoon is too fast paced :d
[6:26:03] nosebleedlol: 5v5 bgs

[6:26:44] yellowgaiden: i can't wait til phase 4 when every city will be raided
[6:26:47] blazzedzz: Make a new BG with different mechanics and try new things for SOD
[6:26:51] infuze27: I need arenas or rbgs in sod/classic fo sho
[6:26:54] Zacrilioth: would zoning STV help with lag? (once event starts no one can enter STV)
[6:26:54] nosebleedlol: dismantle price is so jacked rn 10g for the mats
[6:26:56] KairuruTV: i dont think arenas would fit classic, but rated rbgs could
[6:26:58] deebo5o2: the problem is there is no updated BG loot and its outdated cuz of gnomer

[6:51:38] pala_DAN: hey @xaryu what addon do you use to hide the blizzard art bar?
[6:52:10] thamysticog: are you heal?
[6:52:13] KosmicDevil_: what does spin mean?
[6:52:15] gregfork: Don't you think rod is actually better for pvp than the gnomer staff since you're not really casting arcane spells in pvp?
[6:52:32] aggr0crag32: @KosmicDevil_ aoe on flag
[6:52:47] batchestspam: damn tied game , close one
[6:53:13] btrflylol: GAMING
[6:53:20] KosmicDevil_: @aggr0crag32 what does that do exactly? like prevent them from capping or
[6:53:26] KosmicDevil_: im a pvp noob
[6:53:33] macjcool: they had like 10
[6:53:36] Nimbus723: should have grabbed BS
[6:53:46] kirk_hunts: When there's meat (enemy players) on the flag you gotta kill them and cap (spin) so the timer start working the other direction. So if you see Meat, Spin.
[6:53:51] chipchronly: sucks how bad mage feels in bgs
[6:53:51] foolsendit: Spell Healing increases the strength of your healing spells by a flat amount. This is a very weak stat for Mage Healers, as it only affects direct healing, such as the one done by Regeneration and Mass Regeneration casts, but it does not affect any Temporal Beacon healing, which is the vast majority of your healing! was on icy veins sorry for paragraph
[6:53:53] lordsloths: horde just better
[6:54:04] biggemlol: @KosmicDevil_ yes, capping requires a cast bar to complete. taking any dmg stops the player from capping. similar to a hearthstone
[6:54:06] bobbuildsitt: Go BS!

[7:10:43] Diabolikkgg: @Xaryu and youre fine with that gameplay ? xd
[7:10:45] TheBiggestDorc: what do you do when they run away from living flame
[7:10:45] kokoMcgogo: @rollinsthechamp So you are saying those changes favor Snutz? Makes no sense
[7:10:55] thebigdogg3: peak gameplay right there

Im a fire mage and just got the gnomeregan neck quest, my mates are telling me to go with the crit neck but all guides suggest the spell power one? Whats the right choice?
[7:13:10] iFreeze420: I love burnout + ice lance w nova/frostbites. 70%+ crit chance spamming
[7:13:15] dillydackx: ello xar im weston the priest xD
[7:13:20] LemonsSauced: Could anybody explain the term "spinning" regarding BGs
[7:13:22] rollinsthechamp: @kokoMcgogo First of all why wouldnt it make sense if I said it? Second of all I didnt say it favours snutz I said it might change the outcome, Snutz is a multi r1 and played in many blizzcons you say it as if Xaryu had the upperhand that easily skill-wise
[7:13:23] Stinkyj555: deep fires been fun to play in bgs

[7:13:50] grkgemini94: mage is super fragile, you can nerf our 1 shot or our aoe and suddenly noone will feel good playing a mage unless you give them a new toy
[7:13:52] ghandi300savage: thanks
[7:13:54] ottersarepeopletoo: crit for fire
[7:13:55] naturalduck: the melee neck has spell crit
[7:13:56] MrPolite2112: Only one option lol
[7:13:58] JoeBangles_: even as healer you choose piston
[7:13:59] TydenHc: spell-crit

[7:14:14] WeedWizrd: Gnome at?

[7:14:18] DeMeLoNiA: SoD is not balanced for PvP HahaLean
[7:14:20] MrPolite2112: @joebangles_ unless you main heal as a priest. Mana regen is nice
[7:14:28] junkilolzaa: whens rav doing sod p2 hardcore
[7:14:29] ghandi300savage: The Peace officers neck does have 1% spell crit tho @Xaryu
[7:14:31] rollinsthechamp: @epicninja808 What do you consider crazy good gameplay usually?
[7:14:42] BadMicro: @DeMeLoNiA you coulda stopped after the word balanced :P

[7:15:29] hazelgrant: VoHiYo
[7:15:48] Stingin: crit neck yes
[7:15:49] magical_scientist: last round. last one standing tournament
[7:15:50] ghandi300savage: PvE andys I need you
[7:15:52] MrPolite2112: @joebangles_ true, it's a preference I guess at that point.
[7:15:53] d1ehardy: 1% crit is massive and bis for fire
[7:15:55] ghandi300savage: @Stingin tyty

[7:16:08] Enterpool: that heal is crazy lol
[7:16:08] Spellb00k: its like 26 sp for one crit in this verison or some?
[7:16:12] Coorsy: piston is BiS
[7:16:12] tsetse2fly: I'd still go with piston pendant
[7:16:18] batchestspam: 8 int for more mana is bigger plus SP
[7:16:20] Stingin: makes sense yea
[7:16:31] nicktamere666: isnt intellect spell crit as well?
[7:16:31] apolowiz: Piston BIS; cuz mages actually need alot of mana with all the heals we can do now
[7:16:32] JamesRig: int = crit
[7:16:33] DeMeLoNiA: AP is very good for spell casters HahaLean
[7:16:44] adam_brisbane: if you win again you still going to have 2 marks again KEKW

[7:30:24] faddatv: the healing isnt +dmg
[7:30:27] tsetse2fly: @jellymann Well I'd still expet them to be better at later stages with better gear. But you NEED to find good healing buddies. For example if you get Bonereaver's edge at 60 you instantly become a top pvp:er in bgs with heal
[7:30:27] ThrokkTheWarrior: spells and EFFECTS
[7:30:34] BrotherDanTV: It doesn't double dip, your dmg IS healing
[7:30:35] Deathandtaxes07: wait but mages dont ahve any healing spells?
[7:30:37] Lepatats: and effects
[7:30:38] ThrokkTheWarrior: i thing chrono is an effect
[7:30:40] reefo: isn't your healing based on oypur damage
[7:30:45] Orisklit: doesn't
[7:30:46] istinklikepoop69: the staff insta rez for the pvp event might be kinda nice too @Xaryu
[7:30:48] mageguy8: I think bfd offhand + dagger is better than staff, even with aku'mai dagger elisBlob
[7:31:01] TheHieroja: i dont stack
[7:31:01] rickksen: @reefo thats a point
[7:31:04] Hello_Im_Mattias: Gratz on the Staff @Xaryu
[7:31:06] Fiftyninetwitch: have they designd any new weps in gnome?
[7:31:20] willcantstream: what bfd offhand?
[7:31:22] Deathandtaxes07: im confused why would a mage need healing at all tho? They dont have any healing spells
[7:31:30] adam_brisbane: is the on use like a battle res?
[7:31:38] bullshiiters: @Deathandtaxes07 They do heal based on damage they deal

[7:31:58] TrapAlt: Would the assumption not be, that if you are purely arcane the staff is better? or is the comination mainhand offhand give more spellpower
[7:32:09] Deathandtaxes07: @bullshiiters wait what!?
[7:32:09] ooober60: rank 5 bracers?
[7:32:12] tsetse2fly: @adam_brisbane not a bres, regular res that is RNG

[7:32:24] gamerwatcher77: how is mage in pvp right now
[7:32:28] StunningPaul: You need Tidal Charm?
[7:32:30] BigDJaki: how did you level your mage? did u just quest and dungeon or did u aoe grind?
[7:32:38] bullshiiters: @Deathandtaxes07 Shaman, lock and rogue can tank too
[7:32:39] Deathandtaxes07: HOLY SHIT! i didnt know in SOD they gave mages heals
[7:32:47] naturalduck: We need another set of gear  that gives a perfect  35 healing to test Kappa
