[0:05:50] cupcakechaos013: I’ve been trying honor mode in BG3 and it’s infuriatingly addictive haha
[0:05:55] itsparvati: she doesnt know the people, but she knows the dogs
[0:05:58] anker_jym: Since the mount is called Sharkbait, maybe you should do today's runs with the Left Shark pet out, to see if he can sniff the mount out.
[0:06:18] witchhobbit: voice but it's better now that i turned my volume up more LOL mine was lower than usual tbh hahah
[0:06:42] GreenArrowed: @cupcakechaos013 how far have you gotten? i havne't started my honour mode run yet.
[0:06:46] jimmymidjinnilsson: My dogs names are: Zafira and shes the mother and Atlas is one of her sons
[0:07:10] kynlaeh: hazel the midwest US weather is crazy. today is 50 F and by saturday it will be low 30s, Monday back up to 70 F and next thursday down to 30s again
[0:07:28] cupcakechaos013: @greenarrowed my first try I died to the brains on the beach…right now on my 4th try….i just got to the grove
[0:07:30] itsparvati: pnda TW week= alt leveling week for me, got 3 done yesterday

[0:08:33] itsparvati: 30s is warm for midwest
[0:08:39] itsparvati: especially in feb
[0:08:41] AmiYuy: Question for anyone - Can I only get the big rewards from Researchers Under Fire once per week?
[0:08:49] GreenArrowed: @cupcakechaos013 ooh i almost died there too and was so mad. then reminded myself it's supposed to be hard.
[0:09:06] Tofterid: ohh gz gz

[0:09:07] AmiYuy: Grats Hazel!
[0:09:25] kikisume: grats!!
[0:09:35] cupcakechaos013: @greenarrowed Yupp, I went through tactician and I fought for my life every step haha but I made it so now it’s time to get those gold dice
[0:09:37] witchhobbit: the other day they cancelled school and gave us text alert warnings for a lot of snow and we ended up getting maybe 1 inch or 2 of snow lol
[0:10:19] AmiYuy: Thank you Hazel!  It's confused me so much I've avoided it until now.
[0:10:19] witchhobbit: gratz on the moonbeast!! rly makes me wanna try more pvp :')

[0:14:31] kikisume: @pudde93 I say go check out *** you can tips, guides, etc
[0:14:40] anker_jym: @pudde93 don't feel like you have to do everything. There's lots of public events this time around, and they're not all relevant or required depending on your goals. Also, what Hazel said
[0:14:57] blueboywiz: do you collect items multiple times if they have the same appearance?
[0:15:16] witchhobbit: some achievements will reward collectables, will it still show the achievement string?
[0:15:26] anker_jym: Whoa, we're halfway there. Who-OA, Hazel has new hair!
[0:15:27] witchhobbit: if you take achievement off ATT
[0:15:32] cashthb: how about the rare hunt achievments tho? they are very FUN :)

[0:17:48] cashthb: PogChamp harlans loaded dice
[0:17:52] itsparvati: i managed to get this one during bfa, but im farming underrot still for that one
[0:18:15] GreenArrowed: ooo were they gel pens?
[0:18:16] BoogiePonderosa: finally did a follower dungeon. worked pretty well
[0:18:32] witchhobbit: i am still doing korthia dailies... LUL and also zereth mortis. the paragon drops a lot of mog
[0:18:32] GreenArrowed: oooh i like those
[0:18:36] Zuldak: we're not in freehold for any mount, its to get into the spirit of 10.2.6 pirates right?
[0:18:56] Elrathir: I just bit my tongue while eating Pizza #skill
[0:19:10] anker_jym: Speaking of unicorns, do you have the Pureheart Courser for 100 Exalted reps?
[0:19:11] itsparvati: that is adorbable, ngl
[0:19:45] TinySp00k: Love this Transmog :)
[0:19:46] saga_no: Husband gave me a late Valentine's Day gift today; he said it was usual to gift flowers for Valentine's - ...so he got me the LEGO Orchid
[0:19:51] BoogiePonderosa: "one freehold please" LUL
[0:20:07] itsparvati: @saga_no he is a keeper for sure
[0:20:13] BoogiePonderosa: ARRRR
[0:20:15] GreenArrowed: those pirates
[0:20:16] 6sixthousand6: my gawd....we are through the looking glass people!
[0:20:16] AmiYuy: hazelLurk hazelLurk hazelLurk
[0:20:28] saga_no: @itsparvati I do love LEGO ;D
[0:20:33] witchhobbit: @saga_no the lego flowers are the best
[0:20:59] saga_no: Yep. Also because both Hubby and I are allergic to any / all flowers... we don't waste money on real ones
[0:20:59] soullmagic: hello hazel hazelWave
[0:21:16] anker_jym: I should by now, any time I ask Hazel if she has "X" mount, the answer is yes lol
[0:21:28] itsparvati: or the heartburn
[0:21:48] forebringer: that was the end of BFA cause shadowlands came out November 2020
[0:21:48] cashthb: like sharkbait? :)
[0:22:09] BoogiePonderosa: lens flares
[0:22:12] saga_no: Murloc in Gatorade
[0:22:18] saga_no: that's what I'm blaming
[0:22:18] TotallyNotRaien: blaming the planets is always the go in my book
[0:22:19] itsparvati: its a hidden pirate lair, of course its hard to find
[0:22:27] jeffdmk: has anyone tried the better bags addon? I am using adi bags and wondering how big of a change it will be

[0:23:32] GreenArrowed: jazz snap
[0:23:41] anker_jym: Alright, I need that
[0:23:52] BoogiePonderosa: i was glad to see it keeps the form even while mounted
[0:24:02] BoogiePonderosa: which is extra funny
[0:24:26] TotallyNotRaien: because of that single toy we need murlock playable race
[0:24:34] cashthb: gamons braid does it I think
[0:24:44] TotallyNotRaien: yeah theyre great
[0:25:10] GreenArrowed: they would create a completely new murloc group for that
[0:25:11] Zuldak: i mean yeah they can mount...
[0:25:22] Gynebra: Sethrak pls!
[0:25:22] GreenArrowed: i just want tuskaar and naga
[0:25:28] itsparvati: if i was playing a murloc i dont think i could stop myself from just trolling people all day
[0:25:31] Chemex13: Mogu!
[0:25:37] forebringer: I really want the Sethrak
[0:25:38] RVIA: why are you farming this dungeon again ?
[0:25:43] BoogiePonderosa: yeah it's like a kid running with swimming fins

[0:25:53] 7thSaga: Hazel have you tried going for Shackled Ur'zul? its been almost 2 years for me and no drop im starting to give up on the light :(
[0:26:00] Zuldak: think of the 20 man ogre raids
[0:26:03] RVIA: I just want all the elves to be faction free tbh !!! <3
[0:26:08] anker_jym: Ethereals please, I need my mummies!
[0:26:16] RVIA: and a graphical update please
[0:26:48] forebringer: blastable or skippable
[0:26:51] witchhobbit: yeah i would love that mount but eonar sucks
[0:26:57] TotallyNotRaien: i just want thiccboi dracthyr
[0:27:04] BoogiePonderosa: how do i know if i have the fyrakk skip?
[0:27:06] saga_no: I did the intro(?) quests to the dig things / new rep faction / whatever it is ... I am SO confused by the whole ordeal
[0:27:09] witchhobbit: gonna wait on it as long as possible still
[0:27:17] BoogiePonderosa: was it a quest turn in?
[0:27:20] 7thSaga: Hazel or Chat is it just me or does some old raid skips reset sometimes where you gotta do that quest again?
[0:27:34] saga_no: @BoogiePonderosa When you enter the raid, do you get offered a quest? If not - do you already have it in your log? If not - you likely have the skip
[0:27:34] BoogiePonderosa: ok
[0:27:50] xGoodspeed17: 5/9 bosses is insane for a skip
[0:27:52] 7thSaga: O_o
[0:27:59] xGoodspeed17: i thought the skip was gonna be gnarlroot tswift fyrakk
[0:27:59] witchhobbit: that's a skip? LOL
[0:28:00] TotallyNotRaien: thats a slap in the face
[0:28:05] J_Trinta: Hey hazel, did you finish your pvp mount?

[0:31:13] anker_jym: This is the one time where the phrase No Dice would be a good thing lol
[0:31:21] easley___: i wanna move to canada so badly tbh
[0:31:30] saga_no: @momentum1986 What would that be? Hawaii? Puerto Rico?
[0:31:31] eziekiyah: michigan?

[0:31:55] kynlaeh: hazel, did you like living in portland overall? i am looking at making a move after grad school from the midwest and the PNW (seattle or portland) is a place i find so pretty and tranquil.
[0:31:57] eziekiyah: yes I was right!!
[0:32:04] Neltalie: im from the denmark of denmark :D
[0:32:05] kynlaeh: i figured  it was michigan as someone in indiana
[0:32:06] saga_no: (Mind you - to me - Denmark is *SOUTH*.... LUL )
[0:32:11] 7thSaga: @saga_no LUL
[0:32:11] RVIA: @saga_no he ment geographically i think
[0:32:13] lindlyn: Orange Iowa
[0:32:13] witchhobbit: there are places farther up north in the US tho
[0:32:19] BoogiePonderosa: denmark is a state of MIND maaan
[0:32:22] vildusten: @saga_no same
[0:32:26] RVIA: oh well
[0:32:27] witchhobbit: i'm shrugging lol
[0:32:37] saga_no: That's what I'm asking - what makes it geographically Denmark-esque - since Denmark isn't that far north..... ?
[0:32:39] momentum1986: I mean… it’s mostly surrounded by water, peninsular.
[0:32:47] saga_no: Michigan is pretty far up north as far as I recall
[0:32:55] RVIA: movies and insta
[0:32:58] RVIA: ahaha
[0:33:15] kynlaeh: michigan borders canada
[0:33:17] witchhobbit: yeah all the songs you needed to learn all the state names and whatnot lol

[0:33:48] BoogiePonderosa: HAHA
[0:33:51] kynlaeh: i think theres a large dutch population not sure about danish
[0:33:53] BoogiePonderosa: it SHOULD be tho
[0:33:59] saga_no: The Philly Cheesesteaks would be the best team
[0:33:59] kynlaeh: my great grandma is dutch and is there
[0:34:08] BoogiePonderosa: big ole drippy sammich on the sides of the helmets
[0:34:15] saga_no: I might even consider rooting for them if they were called the Cheesesteaks
[0:34:33] eziekiyah: ah kk my bad
[0:34:33] saga_no: BUt only consider - since - yaknow - my team is from the same state... LUL

[0:34:53] cashthb: yo Hazel, wanna do an eropean countries map quiz? c'mon Hazel, it will be fun Hazel!
[0:34:57] jeffdmk: like the banana slugs?
[0:35:03] Daemavand: Thank you! Busy busy with work but have 20 min to chekc in or so :D
[0:35:18] witchhobbit: LUL  fun
[0:35:19] BoogiePonderosa: i do appreciate oddball team names like Marlins, Pelicans,  Blue Jackets
[0:35:28] Daemavand: I love map quizzes!! pick me!
[0:35:39] saga_no: You'd find the Iberian peninsula pretty easy, and the UK I think
[0:35:43] cashthb: that's why it would be fun...
[0:35:43] itsparvati: geography was what... 5th grade
[0:35:48] Daemavand: Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego taught me everything I need to know about geography lol
[0:35:49] easley___: worst canadian province?
[0:35:59] saga_no: And when you find the UK - you'd find Iceland - and then Norway, Sweden, Finland fairly quickly
[0:36:02] GFairyGaming: @easley___ Alberta
[0:36:08] mehayla: you totally can
[0:36:11] mehayla: ontario sucks
[0:36:14] momentum1986: oh god, my seventh grade teacher had us memorizing maps and drawing them out by hand. I can still tell you where Djibouti is
[0:36:14] Ujai321: Did you finish shuffling?
[0:36:18] mehayla: onterrible
[0:36:19] kaur_q: Nunavut far too cold
[0:36:24] Daemavand: OH RIGHT
[0:36:26] Daemavand: GRATS
[0:36:28] itsparvati: i confuse norway and sweden all the time
[0:36:29] Daemavand: you're freeeeeeeeee
[0:36:33] mehayla: hey, as an albertan, alberta is cool LOL
[0:36:36] kynlaeh: alberta is so pretty tho
[0:36:51] Ujai321: Looks better on horde anyway Kappa
[0:36:52] Daemavand: I cannot believe you did that either
[0:36:56] Daemavand: you are so stubborn lol
[0:37:06] ProGnomie: should I attempt to do ALL quests in the game?
[0:37:08] Ujai321: Ok, but are you doing it in solo shuffle again next season
[0:37:15] cashthb: you *could* get it tho
[0:37:19] GFairyGaming: Sorry, Alberta minus Calgary.
[0:37:21] marq1981: heya
[0:37:26] Ujai321: All quests is a lot of quests
[0:37:26] GFairyGaming: Alberta is like the FLorida of Canada
[0:37:27] itsparvati: @ProGnomie i saw a guy doing that on stream, he was a bit nutty
[0:37:31] saga_no: @ProGnomie Yes. Do it.
[0:37:38] jeffdmk: @ProGnomie it gets really tricky near the end
[0:37:44] mehayla: @GFairyGaming Calgary is the worst part, and lethbridge
[0:37:52] kynlaeh: i think BC and Alberta are my faves, ontario was ok
[0:38:03] marq1981: why not farm rise on any m+ for reins of quantum coarser
[0:38:07] Daemavand: It's so subjective, I loved living in Calgary, despite being back in Montreal
[0:38:09] Elrathir: the obsidian cobraskin grind is so good for money atm, 8k gold each on EU :)
[0:38:10] anker_jym: @prognomie Do it! I'm trying to do the same thing currently
[0:38:13] Daemavand: and the cities are SOOOOOOO different lol
[0:38:15] Ujai321: You just made that up, right? No way that is a place
[0:38:17] jeffdmk: @ProGnomie There are likely some quests you cant do already without another account
[0:38:18] itsparvati: i moved back to the east coast for family, but i miss the midwest so much. it sucks here
[0:38:24] Ujai321: Not noot woot?
[0:38:25] marq1981: probably bigger cahnce for sharkbait
[0:38:34] ProGnomie: province or territory? ;)
[0:38:34] Daemavand: @Ujai321 It is very much a place lol
[0:38:38] mehayla: Calgary isnt TOO bad I guess, depends where in the city you lived
[0:38:43] cashthb: there are infrastructure problems everywhere tho
[0:38:48] anker_jym: Wait, do you have the King's Rest raptor?
[0:38:51] ramzie0: What difficulty does sharkbait drop from?
[0:38:53] GFairyGaming: BC is wonderful, except it's so expensive here. You know it's bad when the joke is BC stands for Bring Cash
[0:38:57] marq1981: fair enough
[0:39:05] ProGnomie: @anker_jym i read somewhere it says it will take like 3000 hours lol
[0:39:15] momentum1986: @neltalie what part of Denmark are you from? I studied in Copenhagen for a semester, absolutely loved my time there
[0:39:18] mehayla: You know its bad when the oilfield can't keep up with inflation anymore lol
[0:39:43] exwisey: if an evoker goes back to Legion, what class hall do they get?
[0:39:48] Daemavand: Which was a problem with Yellowknife last year, with the fires in the NWT
[0:40:17] cashthb: I'm pretty sure you can drive there, what you mean is that there are no roads
[0:40:17] ProGnomie: what class are you planning on maining next xpac?
[0:40:19] jeffdmk: the time reaver is a worse mount farm
[0:40:22] 7thSaga: LUL ''i dont wanna''
[0:40:39] ProGnomie: I enjoyed holy priest in legion
[0:40:43] gordastico: is there a date for expansion release?
[0:40:44] Ujai321: Holy gnomey
[0:40:53] kynlaeh: i visited victoria, vancouver, and seattle several years ago and they were all so nice
[0:41:01] kynlaeh: so pretty
[0:41:04] Daemavand: Trolls <3
[0:41:13] anker_jym: *cries in Dwarvish*
[0:41:28] witchhobbit: priest (and pally) is going to be so fun in war within hopefully, we'll see with hero talents though lol
[0:41:31] cashthb: but that's horde, where's your faction pride?!
[0:41:33] ProGnomie: wait, they are getting rid of auction house?
[0:41:53] witchhobbit: just with xala'tath and the light and everything, it's my jam
[0:41:55] momentum1986: do you have the rustfeather mount? I’m still 0-350+
[0:41:56] BoogiePonderosa: gnome-sayin?!
[0:42:04] Ujai321: Finally, your lifelong dream of "I'm gonna be a hunter with skinning and leatherworking, and I can make my own gear!" Could finally become a reality
[0:42:08] ProGnomie: don't scare me like that lol
[0:42:12] Daemavand: I didnt know that, thats really cool
[0:42:27] jeffdmk: wow no ah in retail people would lose their crap
[0:42:34] Daemavand: damnit now I'm tempted lol
[0:42:35] saga_no: Because I'm insufferable - I looked up Nunavut and the capital's latitudes
[0:42:51] momentum1986: I was sad when they got rid of the AH from the mobile app
[0:42:55] Ujai321: I forget, is ssf hc?
[0:43:00] Perkolate: Yo im' def goin in on SSF. sounds super fun
[0:43:01] ProGnomie: so hardcore means you need to delete you character after? so are you not going to raid and risk the biscuit?
[0:43:27] Ujai321: She isn't gonna do dungeons even
[0:43:29] kynlaeh: i looked at moving to british columbia but my career is not as big of a thing there as it is in the states and the role is a bit different
[0:43:47] Perkolate: Are you ready for the Deathlog content on hardcore again?
[0:43:56] kaur_q: its solo so no groups
[0:44:03] saga_no: Ohboi. Should I make a Deathlog command? ;P
[0:44:04] apheelia96: what u farming in there?
[0:44:04] Elrathir: Deathlog content is my favorite
[0:44:05] Ujai321: Getting to 60 is also a VERY long journey
[0:44:07] Daemavand: Deathlog was a blast lol
[0:44:07] msmester1: i mean sff rules are over on reaching 60 no?
[0:44:08] cashthb: they should do an expac with no ah, and only crafting orders - you can take my idea Chris
[0:44:26] ProGnomie: pew pew
[0:44:34] Ujai321: Do you miss Reddit?
[0:44:37] jeffdmk: so you are hoping flabbie can carry you?
[0:44:38] cashthb: well it's *SOLO* self found
[0:44:44] ProGnomie: what's your fave cocktail?
[0:45:15] saga_no: They haven't made it so you can't group up in SSF as far as we know
[0:45:17] jeffdmk: shrimp cocktails are amazing
[0:45:18] ProGnomie: yumm
[0:45:19] Ujai321: You said "unless I misread it", and my brain was slow and thought "miss Reddit". You get it
[0:45:25] kynlaeh: im a fan of a french martini
[0:45:34] BoogiePonderosa: dark and stormy?
[0:45:39] witchhobbit: what is in that?
[0:45:40] ProGnomie: negroni for me
[0:45:40] humaj1942: @Ujai321 unless Miss Reddit gets involved
[0:45:41] MillyLynn: Blizzard is being very careful to not use the word "solo", they specifically call it "Self Found".
[0:45:42] msmester1: i wish crafting orders were in classic it would be kinda nice without the material quality and no talent trees
[0:45:47] BoogiePonderosa: it's rum and ginger beer
[0:46:03] ProGnomie: what about cocktail bars? they have lots here in toronto
[0:46:11] kynlaeh: lemon drop martinis are also great
[0:46:13] Xan1988OG: Xan1988OG subscribed with Prime. 
[0:46:13] Streamlabs: xan1988og just subscribed with Twitch Prime!
[0:46:21] kynlaeh: sweet like lemon cake tho lol
[0:46:25] Ujai321: We will find out in a bit. Makes no difference to you anyway
[0:46:27] witchhobbit: all i need is vodka and cranberry juice lol
[0:46:36] Elrathir: Nightflame looking precious
[0:46:42] Daemavand: I'm a simple soul, give me a cozy pub with some homies and I'm a happy Dae
[0:46:46] itsparvati: drinking is for boomers, have a vape
[0:46:51] cashthb: kinda lame ngl, grouping up for caves is really [not manly]
[0:46:56] msmester1: i drank so much wine lol
[0:46:58] Ujai321: Did you see they are raising prices on subs in Canada?
[0:46:58] kynlaeh: long island iced teas are what i do when i want somethin to work tho
[0:46:59] xaezoria: i work in a bar and its so easy to just take one or two drinks after work
[0:47:02] momentum1986: I’ve been not drinking since 2015 lol. it’s better that way
[0:47:05] witchhobbit: any drink makes me so sleepy now. i don't enjoy it anymore
[0:47:13] xaezoria: escpecially since i get staff price
[0:47:17] Ujai321: Twitch subs, yeah
[0:47:19] ProGnomie: or Subway?
[0:47:26] itsparvati: wine is the worst, one glass and im in bed
[0:47:30] sence_00: @Ujai321 i honestly thought you means sandwiches for some reason
[0:47:46] witchhobbit: @itsparvati same
[0:47:52] Ujai321: Understandable, I also have sandwiches on my mind
[0:47:59] 7thSaga: The Boss from SubWay Kreygasm
[0:48:12] ProGnomie: I work in advertising, curious on your thoughts of Twitch monetization
[0:48:14] xaezoria: awww nommin little kitty
[0:48:25] Zuldak: dont eat the twitch subs D:
[0:48:38] kynlaeh: i have that exact same problem and why i get subs out
[0:48:55] saga_no: I don't think I've had a Subway sub in like 20 years, heh
[0:48:57] Daemavand: That is fascinating to me simply because I have the opposite problem, I often don't have enough fresh veggies
[0:48:59] itsparvati: remembers the sad carrots rotting in my frig
[0:49:03] Daemavand: because I eat an absurd amount each day
[0:49:10] TotallyNotRaien: fresh-ish sometimes
[0:49:12] kynlaeh: i love a good banh mi
[0:49:18] momentum1986: I worked at a subway in highschool. we got to eat the broken cookies. suspiciously, there were always more cookies broken on my shift
[0:49:19] saga_no: Subway does exist here... or at least used to
[0:49:22] mokorii: Sometimes I buy spinach to freeze it and forget to freeze it before it goes bad im so bad
[0:49:22] ProGnomie: raw carrots?
[0:49:25] ProGnomie: cooked carrots?
[0:49:26] itsparvati: they do keep for a while
[0:49:27] 7thSaga: @Zuldak arcusSub1 arcusSub2
[0:49:29] ProGnomie: steamed carrots?
[0:49:31] Ujai321: I am getting better at using the produce. But it is a slow process
[0:49:46] Ujai321: Roasted carrot is pretty good
[0:49:47] itsparvati: roasted carrots are best
[0:49:57] momentum1986: oh man, roasted carrots with shallots are the best
[0:50:05] Ujai321: Roasted most things are pretty good, tbh
[0:50:08] 7thSaga: did you know? a Tomato is a Fruit? Kappa lol
[0:50:09] kynlaeh: hazel im curious what your opinion is on calamari? my partner really likes it
[0:50:30] itsparvati: brussel sprouts!! i was the weird kid who loved them
[0:50:32] Ujai321: A reSOUPgence? (Resurgence... Listen, I'm tired)
[0:50:45] cashthb: you can grate them and mix it into a grill cheese
[0:51:02] JustFrogging: my husband and I rant about this exact thing
[0:51:03] TotallyNotRaien: b-but SEO optimization!
[0:51:10] Daemavand: Raisins are good.
[0:51:14] Ujai321: But you 1) watched it and 2) told us about it, so they won
[0:51:24] saga_no: A true kitchen 'hack' would be swapping out your chopping veggies for a mandolin
[0:51:31] cashthb: tips are for americans, just force employers to give out decent wages
[0:51:31] itsparvati: @Daemavand raisins in indian curry are awesome
[0:51:40] ProGnomie: hacks give me 'wikihow' vibes
[0:52:06] Daemavand: @itsparvati That would be good!!
[0:52:09] itsparvati: hacks=using an item in an unexpected way... atleast to me
[0:52:17] Ujai321: Do you die if you fall off the bridge?
[0:52:47] kynlaeh: do you still make your own sushi?
[0:52:58] ProGnomie: thoughts on youtube shorts?
[0:53:05] SirJonny1998: @Ujai321 you cant fall off the bridge
[0:53:12] Daemavand: A+ to sushi bowls
[0:53:16] marbared: poke,
[0:53:22] TotallyNotRaien: everybody knows bowls make food more delicious
[0:53:33] Ujai321: "so far, I made 2, and I hate it"
[0:53:41] Daemavand: I mean at least you're using a spoon rather than just sticking your face in the bowl and enjoying the hell out of that sushi bowl lol
[0:54:00] kynlaeh: thats how i feel about burritos, so much easier to just make a bowl
[0:54:12] ProGnomie: working in the ad industry, there is a LOT of talk around shorts and allocating budget towards that tactic
[0:54:13] itsparvati: they are basically an ad for your channel
[0:54:19] Ujai321: Speaking of, I was perplexed to see a video of you on insta
[0:54:33] cashthb: just get some ai to make it
[0:54:50] ProGnomie: Google is working on Demand Gen with Shorts being lower funnel, so it will likely help in terms of monetization
[0:55:27] kynlaeh: my partner saw it and now was interested in your stream so it worked :)
[0:55:32] Ujai321: The ever shrinking attention spans
[0:56:07] cashthb: you can ask me!
[0:56:07] ProGnomie: more actionable-based, traffic (click) campaigns! sorry I'm talking in jargon
[0:56:08] marbared: squirrel!
[0:56:24] captivate7: I have fallen in the trap of ACOTAR series, just finished book 1. And now my Tiktok is flooded with all of it. I am taking a break from it xD
[0:56:36] captivate7: from Tiktok*
[0:56:43] TotallyNotRaien: tiktok would ruin my life
[0:57:07] JustFrogging: feel like there is a word for that somewhere
[0:57:12] saga_no: @captivate7 How is it? My Bookish YouTube is full of that series...
[0:57:25] captivate7: it's SO good
[0:57:29] WhippWhapp: o/ happy thursday, have to head out for a job so I will lurk
[0:57:30] captivate7: I love the way she writes
[0:57:34] Ujai321: I don't scroll on short form video for that exact reason. It's like junk food for my brain. But then again, I did spend hours browsing Craigslist today, so I still lose
[0:57:40] captivate7: I can't wait to dive into book 2 ^_^
[0:57:47] saga_no: Hm.
[0:57:47] cashthb: subscribe to a ton of sexist or whatnot channels that would get you upset & away from the screen
[0:57:47] marbared: “I’m not on the tick tock” - old man me
[0:58:06] ProGnomie: im an avid ASMR watcher/listener, so watch a lot of YouTube. It's an easy swap over to shorts
[0:58:21] JustFrogging: good as a tool for specific use, bad for broadform entertainment
[0:58:23] saga_no: I'm just weary of it, because it seems - based on very mixed reviews of it - to be heavy on the romance; would you say that is accurate @captivate7 ?
[0:58:29] ProGnomie: altho i don't consumer short form content on TikTok, and am a Gen Z
[0:58:36] anker_jym: On that note, do you listen to any podcasts?
[0:58:39] averageteacup: you do what you can to bring audience... including going to wretched hive of scum and villainy just to throw a video or two :D
[0:58:46] mokorii: I'm glad I deleted tiktok when I did it seems like so many people my age (25) are addicted to that app
[0:58:58] Sneaky_Tav: finally got the leggo just now
[0:58:58] saga_no: Dopamine-hit
[0:59:04] TotallyNotRaien: dopamine crash
[0:59:19] Ujai321: "I can't watch this 45 minute episode, it's too long and taxing to watch. Ohhh, this 3 hour video essay about an obscure Russian video game I have never heard of sounds interesting"
[0:59:26] captivate7: @saga_no I wouldn't say the entire book was based off of romance or intimacy, but there was some. I think book 1 is tame compared to the others (from what I've heard)
[0:59:39] Daemavand: I think you're onto something there, though
[0:59:47] georgemag99: hedonic Balance is a thing
[1:00:12] Ujai321: (hbomberguy's video on Pathologic, btw. Great stuff)
[1:00:18] TotallyNotRaien: putting this on my hard facts book brb
[1:00:24] saga_no: @captivate7 Hmm.. ok. I'll see if I can find the first book in the series or at least an excerpt of it to see if I like the writing style then :)
[1:00:26] Ujai321: So your brain thinks a lot about your brain, hu?
[1:00:50] captivate7: @saga_no What kind of books do you usually enjoy? Any favorite authors?
[1:00:53] JustFrogging: @Ujai321 metacognitive oooooo
[1:00:57] Elrathir: Huh. I wonder if this is why I get a bit down a little while after absorbing a lot of WoW hype during a patch or expansion reveal.
[1:00:57] Daemavand: 100% agree
[1:00:59] ProGnomie: i don't want to get off of lunch
[1:01:00] anker_jym: Fun fact, the brain is the only organ that named itself.
[1:01:00] MrSonicgen: Heading out. Have a great day.
[1:01:01] Daemavand: actually 1000% agree
[1:01:24] ProGnomie: how about the apple lens thingies
[1:01:27] Daemavand: and the way its generally advised to help mitigate those habits is to try to be aware of your emotional state when you're feeling those impulses
[1:01:36] ProGnomie: vision pro?
[1:01:38] Daemavand: which is super hard
[1:01:43] anker_jym: @elrathir This was 100% me after this last Blizzcon. Having three expansions be announced overloaded me.
[1:01:44] saga_no: @captivate7 Favorite author is Neil Gaiman; I do enjoy Leigh Bardugo's books when I want an easy / quick read. Favorite book of all time is Alice in Wonderland. And of course I'm a Tolkien fan/nerd.
[1:01:49] Ujai321: It's a fine line between self awareness and narcism
[1:02:13] Daemavand: It's something I've been actively trying to cultivate for years, I have my own impulses that I struggle to control
[1:02:15] saga_no: Another favorite book is Jane Eyre, heh
[1:02:28] Daemavand: and progress has definitely been made, but its not perfect
[1:02:29] JustFrogging: narcissists have a harder time admitting failure and accepting criticsm
[1:02:31] cashthb: they look great, aad you're only make fun out of them because you can't afford it!
[1:02:32] saga_no: WHich is *technically* a  "romance" of sorts - but it doesn't shoe-horn in "romance" where it doesn't make sense
[1:02:37] JustFrogging: tell tale signs
[1:02:41] jeffdmk: It seems abundantly clear that hazel is just very self reflective
[1:02:53] ProGnomie: tell me to go back to work pls
[1:02:53] JustFrogging: ^
[1:02:55] Daemavand: Yep exactly!! It's like building your brain muscles to get stronger at managing and processing those emotions
[1:02:57] Zuldak: youve spent a lot of time thinking about this subject
[1:03:05] saga_no: Jane Eyre is the OG Girlboss.
[1:03:11] JustFrogging: hidden wife lol
[1:03:11] saga_no: There I said it
[1:03:28] captivate7: I love the girlboss vibes. That's what I get from the main character in ACOTAR :)
[1:03:46] captivate7: And yes, Tolkien is great. I am too a fan/nerd :P
[1:03:47] Ujai321: Don't trust anyone, because the one time you did, it turned out bad is just good advice
[1:03:48] Daemavand: and this is fascinating but I have to get back to work D:
[1:03:52] Daemavand: take care all and may the mounts be with you
[1:03:56] Zuldak: you should write a book about your musings about psychology and sell it.
[1:04:10] saga_no: How much of a Mary Sue is the ACOTAR main character though?
[1:04:17] Ujai321: Probably on the bifrost
[1:04:20] saga_no: Cuz I truly despise that trope.. it's so incredibly boring LUL
[1:04:20] ProGnomie: meow
[1:04:27] Gynebra: It's important to look back sometimes and see how far you've come. I try to do that when I'm being a bit to harsh on myself
[1:04:35] ProGnomie: meow meow meow
[1:04:41] JustFrogging: "lived experience expert"
[1:04:56] captivate7: I don't think at all lol
[1:05:02] captivate7: but I mean, everyone has their own opinions
[1:05:10] saga_no: I learned to love Jane Austen books when I was a English major in university - ...but like I don't read Austen for the 'romance' ...
[1:05:17] itsparvati: i will never trust a dr on tv
[1:05:30] ProGnomie: dr phil
[1:05:38] saga_no: It's just a 'thing' of that time period (in Austen)
[1:05:40] itsparvati: oz
[1:05:51] saga_no: Not really romantic and never shoe-horned into the plot
[1:05:55] TotallyNotRaien: i read my first non fiction book a couple of days ago, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, a great read
[1:06:35] sence_00: lol what books were those?
[1:06:40] captivate7: That sounds awful lol
[1:07:49] jeffdmk: That is an interesting premise
[1:08:05] ProGnomie: riské
[1:08:10] saga_no: Who's the author?
[1:08:20] jimmymidjinnilsson: jean M auel
[1:09:03] sence_00: you said homo sapiens and I thought for sure we were talking sci-fi for a moment
[1:09:10] cashthb: well... it's called "pre history" for a reason, we hardly have facts, you just pick the theory you like the most
[1:09:15] Zuldak: 30,000 years ago in europe would be wild. Literally just forests and wild animals
[1:09:15] saga_no: Ah. Cuz there's a Swedish/scandi author who wrote a series called "The Legend of the Ice People" that I have not read *yet* - but I have the whole 47-volume shabang on my self
[1:09:17] saga_no: shelf
[1:09:33] witchhobbit: he looks like the "this is fine" meme
[1:09:34] saga_no: The series is 47 volumes
[1:09:46] saga_no: I have... more than 47 books on my shelves... ;P
[1:09:52] TotallyNotRaien: forty seven?
[1:10:00] saga_no: Yes. Forty-seven.
[1:10:02] cashthb: watch a few joe rogan podcasts
[1:10:13] saga_no: They're not terribly long - ...only like 350-400 pages per book
[1:10:21] witchhobbit: oh right, i should mention, i just changed my username! this is haleych lol
[1:10:28] sence_00: ah and then we get to camp the rare spawn on broken shore
[1:10:39] saga_no: I still have Wheel of Time on my TBR
[1:10:44] captivate7: yeah.... no thanks lol
[1:11:10] witchhobbit: i should not mention how many books i have in my 1 bedroom apt NotLikeThis
[1:11:13] saga_no: Because I'm the sort of person who would prefer to read a whole series in one go... and my brain currently refuses to retain any information I read (fatigue and too much stress/crap IRL going on for the past 5 years)
[1:11:27] witchhobbit: i would have more if i had the space, i want to have a library one day
[1:11:47] cashthb: surely not, the Fizzlebangs are well respected warlocks
[1:12:04] Numb2Every1: !gamble all
[1:12:04] TotallyNotRaien: i feel jealous... i read books on my phone so no physical books to put on shelves
[1:12:13] witchhobbit: yeah i'm trying to wait to buy too many more until we move to a more perma place
[1:12:21] saga_no: I grew up with a lot of books; I was in a bookclub as a kid that sent me a book a month in the mail; My parents were in several of these bookclubs as I was growing up - so we had a small library in our living room
[1:12:25] witchhobbit: i got a kindle last year and it has been really nice
[1:12:43] saga_no: and I had like 4 bookshelves in my room stuffed to the gills
[1:12:48] GreenArrowed: i have a book problem
[1:12:52] jeffdmk: if you were doing that you should go all out and get first editions
[1:13:00] GreenArrowed: leather bound books are so pretty
[1:13:04] witchhobbit: for favorite books i would easily want to have a hard copy and a digital copy haha
[1:13:16] kynlaeh: you still considering getting a property in the not so far future?
[1:13:23] anker_jym: Hazel, were you also the type of person who didn't want to read a book/series if your parents tried to suggest one to you? Cause goodness knows I was like that lol
[1:13:23] saga_no: I have a Kindle, and i use Audible; but my *favorite* books I still buy a hardcopy of sometimes to keep on my shelf - and I do love reading physical books when my hands allow it
[1:13:25] GreenArrowed: and i always wanted a beauty & the beast style library with a rolly ladder and everything
[1:13:51] witchhobbit: @saga_no same
[1:13:56] GreenArrowed: @anker_jym i was. i had a hard time reading for school bc i hated being told to read things.
[1:13:57] TotallyNotRaien: nothing is worse than being made to read a book you dont like.... i hated reading school books
[1:14:01] saga_no: @GreenArrowed YES. I watched that movie obsessively as a child and wanted to be Belle - in the library.
[1:14:51] saga_no: @TotallyNotRaien Me regarding Huckleberry Finn. My god I hate that thing.
[1:14:59] captivate7: I just love the smell of books, so I prefer them in my hands.
[1:15:05] witchhobbit: i try to use audible but so far i have only found myself enjoying andy serkis' versions of lotr/hobbit
[1:15:15] anker_jym: @greenarrowed Same here. I was stubborn when it came to that. There was a grand total of 1 series that my parents suggested that I ended up liking.
[1:15:21] saga_no: Mostly because the phonetically written out dialect in it was near impossible to get through, and we were given 5 days to read the whole thing.
[1:15:21] BoogiePonderosa: "No plot summaries!"
[1:15:34] witchhobbit: i can't focus well with audible. i need the physical words
[1:15:43] ogrelord_shreknado: my cousin was a manager of a booksamillion and would give me the pre launch books of series I liked months before they released. it was nice
[1:15:51] witchhobbit: physical? i mean visual lol
[1:15:58] saga_no: @witchhobbit I sometimes take advantage of the combo of Kindle + Audible so I can read while I listen
[1:16:03] GreenArrowed: oh yea, i loved reading on the train when i was commuting
[1:16:03] sence_00: oh man I cant do audiobooks at all it is SO much slower than reading for me
[1:16:08] sence_00: but I respect that it helps othere
[1:16:09] GreenArrowed: i can't focus enough to read at home
[1:16:14] witchhobbit: physical words in the air lol
[1:16:17] TotallyNotRaien: audiobooks are great tho, sometimes i completely zone out and its hard to back track compared to written books
[1:16:32] anker_jym: How do you find your commute these days lol ;)
[1:16:38] witchhobbit: @saga_no yeah i would totally do that more
[1:16:51] saga_no: I've always been a periodic reader; I'll devour books for like 5-6 weeks and then not read *at all* for months
[1:17:05] itsparvati: closing your eyes on the couch with an audiobook is S tier relaxing
[1:17:11] TotallyNotRaien: saame
[1:17:11] GreenArrowed: listening to audio books on the train was funny tho, because you're still reacting to the story but you're notl ooking at anything
[1:17:21] GreenArrowed: so you look coo coo bananas ont he train just making faces. or sobbing.
[1:17:23] Zuldak: @anker_jym some times jammed due to sleepy dog blocking hallway or cat taking up the chair/parking spot at the office
[1:17:27] BoogiePonderosa: hazelShiny hazelTen hazelLurk
[1:17:28] GFairyGaming: I'm so excited, today is my last day in the office. Starting next week I'll be working from home
[1:17:30] TotallyNotRaien: the book blues are real when you finish a series or something
[1:17:56] GreenArrowed: i loooove sleep stories. clam has celebrities reading sleep stories. levar burton's voice is so soothing.
[1:17:56] saga_no: I use audiobooks a lot when I'm having very high pain days (and can't stand having my eyes open and my brain insists on having racing thoughts)
[1:18:01] sence_00: oh was that CBC's Between the Covers? My mom listened to that a lot when I was little
[1:18:08] witchhobbit: i have a hardback copy of the way of kings because it was cheap (i prefer paperback) and i almost immediately had to start reading it on kindle instead
[1:18:16] GreenArrowed: calm*
[1:18:35] saga_no: I reiterate: Andy Serkis reading The Hobbit, LotR and The Silmarillion - ....highly recommend
[1:18:43] captivate7: That's how my body gets tired lol by reading
[1:18:55] witchhobbit: @saga_no yup! it's the best
[1:18:55] GreenArrowed: @saga_no SO GOOD
[1:18:58] Zuldak: Andy Serkis is a gem
[1:19:09] saga_no: He has such good enunciation too
[1:19:20] Zuldak: Still weird he plays Alfred in one of the batman movies
[1:19:30] Zuldak: Gollum into Alfred
[1:19:31] witchhobbit: i like the andy serkis audiobooks on walks, it was especially the best in the fall
[1:19:32] saga_no: so it's easy to follow along -even when English is not your first language and wee all know how Tolkien loves to be ... "eloquent" LUL
[1:20:09] sence_00: I tried listening to the Sylvanas audiobook but turns out, while her voice is awesome...she reads like a female Shatner
[1:20:15] saga_no: I love Neil Gaiman's books - also on audiobook - because he reads them himself, so I get what he intended as far as pacing and such goes
[1:20:25] GreenArrowed: harry lloyd reads the newer version of the dunk and egg (pre game of thrones, post dance of the dragon), he's axcellent
[1:20:29] witchhobbit: are the audiobooks for GoT recommended?
[1:20:32] GreenArrowed: wow i am just typoing everywhere today
[1:20:38] Zuldak: Fun fact: Christopher lee who played Sauromon the White in LOTR was a british spy in WWII. His cousin, Ian Flemming, wrote a fictionalized spy novel very loosely based on Lee's adventures in WWII called James Bond
[1:20:51] TotallyNotRaien: is neil gaiman hard to read? ive had one of his books on my list for a while but havent braved it yet
[1:21:01] witchhobbit: netherlord boy!!!
[1:21:01] saga_no: My biggest pet peeve about audiobooks - especially if it's a series - is if they swap the reader at some point
[1:21:12] saga_no: I just want the *same* voice reading ALL the books, thanks
[1:21:44] saga_no: @TotallyNotRaien I don't find it very hard, no - and I say this as a non-native English reader
[1:21:48] BoogiePonderosa: Eric Idle from monty python narrated Charlie and Chocolate Factory and it's a fun listen
[1:21:49] mianerten: as a high end pve/pvp player, im looking for something chill to do. are the class order halls long? or relatively short?
[1:22:00] TotallyNotRaien: nice to know
[1:22:28] TotallyNotRaien: im currently trying to read war of the scaleborn and its kind of a slog, might put it on DNF
[1:22:29] lintliquor: Once I listened to one with a full cast or at least two readers, its hard for me to listen to any without that
[1:22:42] anker_jym: Listen, even if it's controversial now, the only series I was able to read on audio was Harry Potter, read by Jim Dale.
[1:22:47] TotallyNotRaien: anyone else struggle with starting new books if you havent finishes the one youre on?
[1:22:48] saga_no: @TotallyNotRaien If you've never read any Gaiman before, one of the easier ones to get into would be The Graveyard Book ... one of the 'harder' (in terms of complexity) would be American Gods (but it's SO GOOD)
[1:22:56] mianerten: okay sweet. thanks!
[1:23:09] saga_no: If you want a bit of a mix and fun - Good Omens, written along with Terry Pratchett is an excellent choice
[1:23:17] TotallyNotRaien: ill check those out thanks!
[1:23:28] lintliquor: @TotallyNotRaien Very hard for me but I'm learning to mood read and also be okay with DNF'ing
[1:23:36] saga_no: if you like graphic novels - ...The Sandman is perfection.
[1:23:45] witchhobbit: i just got that book to read before i start the show!
[1:24:07] saga_no: Book is great - show is great
[1:24:16] bobbab5: The new Buffy audio series, Slayers, has been cancelled due to Disney, for....reasons
[1:24:29] eternitycrystal: walkgar
[1:24:35] itsparvati: i hope they allow you to respec tradeskill talents next xpac
[1:24:42] saga_no: The only multi-cast audiobook I have is The Sandman - and the only multi-cast audiobook I don't hate, haha
[1:24:42] itsparvati: i was dumb and i want my pts back
[1:24:57] saga_no: (It makes sense for the Sandman to be multi-cast in audio form - if you know you know)
[1:25:12] BoogiePonderosa: i have a pet peeve about guild player notes: why can't i edit it directly in the first window that pops but instead it needs to open a new window?
[1:25:46] BoogiePonderosa: countless seconds of my life WASTED :D
[1:26:43] GreenArrowed: i always feel so bad when i leave guild with an alt
[1:26:48] 7thSaga: tasnEMP ''dew it''
[1:26:50] saga_no: I've made it a social experiment to see how far I manage to level a toon before the random guild invites start happening
[1:27:06] BoogiePonderosa: @7thSaga LUL
[1:27:08] jeffdmk: time to make a reddit post is hazel leaving her guild and why?
[1:27:21] saga_no: Thusfar - lvl30 seems to be the point where people just hammer you with invites
[1:27:26] GreenArrowed: feels like they could have just given us a one time refund
[1:27:46] ramzie0: Is it possible to get enough knowledge to fill out all the professions trees?
[1:27:46] MrHella: Guild invites start at level 10 for me on Stormrage
[1:27:57] GreenArrowed: i think a lot of people went into it not really knowing what to do, wasting a ton of their knowledge
[1:28:03] MrHella: Almost non-stop until I remember to block them
[1:28:08] itsparvati: people have addons that auto invite guildless, you need to block them asap
[1:28:14] mimpopo: Hey Hazel, just joined the stream. Did you get Sharkbait by any chance? :D
[1:28:33] BoogiePonderosa: do you think they will ever revisit guild leveling?
[1:28:40] mimpopo: Well fingers crossed!
[1:28:41] saga_no: @MrHella I'm an EU main, so that probably plays into it as well, and not as many guilds do the whole random invite thing, it appears
[1:28:45] GreenArrowed: yea that too
[1:28:54] mikael_jansson90: got the sharkbait after like 2200 kills ><
[1:29:01] saga_no: The nicer ones at least whisper you first in game and ask if you want to join -  the random invite without warning is an instant-decline every time
[1:29:11] ramzie0: yeah, i definitely just randomly assigned knowledge and am now screwed, haha
[1:29:15] itsparvati: my lesson learned is i need multiple toons with same trade
[1:29:51] GreenArrowed: having complementary trade is what's worked for me.
[1:30:19] GreenArrowed: i liked having alchemy and inscription between 2 toons
[1:30:20] itsparvati: one for gear crafting, one for misc/de/prospect
[1:30:23] saga_no: Depending on the trade, 2 toons to max out the tree fully between them seems to work fine
[1:30:41] GreenArrowed: do all of my alch then send leftover herbs to the scribe
[1:31:03] Perkolate: alch will always be a safe bet
[1:31:03] itsparvati: alchy stone is always nice early in tier
[1:31:04] saga_no: So like one toon focuses on Armor-crafting and the other toon focuses on weapon-crafting (both being blacksmiths, for example)
[1:31:06] cashthb: I'm telling you tailoring alc; it was great, I didn't even need the money... most of the time
[1:31:10] cashthb: trust me it's great
[1:31:29] GreenArrowed: enchanting was rough
[1:31:31] Perkolate: lmk what you do decide and i wont do those.
[1:31:41] itsparvati: my tailor is used for cloth flipping only, deing bracers for days
[1:31:42] witchhobbit: @mikael_jansson90 that is too many kills, omg. gratz!! ToT
[1:31:44] GreenArrowed: it felt weird to not have crafting orders for ench
[1:31:44] jeffdmk: who talks to people in a multi player game
[1:32:03] saga_no: I like having tailoring on my main, because she's a clothie; my Legacy Main also has tailoring - because I'm working on crafting every cloth armor piece in the game (over time - it takes time........... and so much time.....)
[1:32:07] TotallyNotRaien: we only use the language of jumping in this house!
[1:32:17] cashthb: I never advertised, that's why I didn't make any money, but having the (re)crafts on demand was great
[1:32:17] momentum1986: lots of those crafting system explanations end with “just trust me…” lol
[1:32:25] witchhobbit: i'm really enjoying tailoring and enchanting now
[1:32:43] itsparvati: yeah i sell my cloth cds too
[1:32:59] Perkolate: one of my fav parts were some of the gold making discord having specific channels dedicated to screenshots of ppl confused on paying for "just pressing a button"
[1:33:52] cashthb: just shank him
[1:34:05] saga_no: I try to do that; my alt army has every profession so I can in theory be self-sufficient
[1:34:05] GreenArrowed: oh we're back to warlock class stuff
[1:34:10] GreenArrowed: yes you can't kill her too fast
[1:34:14] GreenArrowed: i had this happen, too
[1:34:17] cashthb: not using the artifact stuff for shanking could help
[1:34:30] averageteacup: use foam sword toy
[1:34:33] cashthb: *staff
[1:34:36] saga_no: Put a DoT on her?
[1:34:39] GreenArrowed: foam sward
[1:34:40] saga_no: and then just slap her ?
[1:35:06] sence_00: whole body shrinka?
[1:35:40] cashthb: what a great idea
[1:35:45] GreenArrowed: always having to nakie fight
[1:35:50] FaxFeller: theres a soft sword toy that is letting you hit a mob without killing it , or something like that
[1:35:51] Xeressia: foam sword?
[1:35:55] GreenArrowed: yea the whole body shrika works, too
[1:36:02] the_do0d: do you have the foam sword toy
[1:36:29] GreenArrowed: this was so fiddly to do at max level in bfa
[1:36:32] BoogiePonderosa: hobo gnome!
[1:36:33] cashthb: you can hit him with the artifact and we could watch kungfury while he hits the treshold
[1:36:53] GreenArrowed: he has a good beard
[1:36:58] averageteacup: that's a lovely beard :D
[1:37:11] GreenArrowed: yey
[1:37:26] saga_no: Yeah the foam sword toy is fantastic for low-level things like this
[1:37:47] saga_no: I also appreciate that it's an easy toy to get
[1:37:56] saga_no: as in - buy it for like 10 copper or whatever off the vendor
[1:37:57] averageteacup: i need to see foam sword raid
[1:38:28] sence_00: i think they changed it so it doesnt work in raid sadly
[1:39:07] glisern: Just got here, kinda curious. 1: quests in Legion? Also, I don't think I've ever seen that quest symbol before, addon doing something?
[1:39:33] saga_no: @glisern Warlock Order Hall :) and the quest symbol is for "special" quests in older expansions
[1:39:47] glisern: aaah, cool :) Thank you
[1:41:23] GreenArrowed: oh, tht's how i feel about the doctor
[1:41:38] kynlaeh: i have the worst dental genetics, i spend so much time on them and i still have to get dental work :/
[1:41:39] saga_no: brb
[1:41:45] kynlaeh: i sort of have a fear of the dentist too
[1:41:50] witchhobbit: having a doctor? what is that
[1:41:57] kynlaeh: so that does not help
[1:42:05] witchhobbit: the dentist is the worst
[1:42:14] GreenArrowed: i have a lot of friends who have bad dental genes and i just didn't realize that was a thing until i was an adult
[1:42:30] witchhobbit: dental insurance doesn't even cover most of it when you get it
[1:42:38] ramzie0: Is there an updated addon that handles the mission tables from wod, legion, bfa, and sl?
[1:42:39] TotallyNotRaien: i had a cavity for years and when i got it treated the dentist said it was almost to the pulp of my molar and wouldnt needed a root canal
[1:42:42] GreenArrowed: dental insurance is a scam
[1:42:50] GreenArrowed: it's the worse of the insruances
[1:42:50] TotallyNotRaien: wouldve*
[1:42:53] kynlaeh: it is better tho now, i use to cry the days before the dentist now i just get anxious but get over it
[1:43:01] witchhobbit: cried having to pay $700 for something at the dentist, when i had insurance lol
[1:43:21] BoogiePonderosa: seeing my grandpa without his dentures was enough to make me appreciate dental care
[1:43:26] GreenArrowed: like, you have to pay then beg your insurance to maybe cover it
[1:43:32] eternitycrystal: It's so sad I pay max 800-900 euros a year going for 8 times to the dentist
[1:43:42] Alannalouwho: my bf and i got some kind of "dental insurance" with our dentist XD so we dont have a 3rd party really involved yet we do get some benefits from it
[1:44:15] GreenArrowed: i'm currently navigating the not fun world of self-employment insurances, and it's not been great
[1:44:35] kynlaeh: my mom goes to a dentist that is like a concierge dentist and its like a monthly bill that she pays and she has access to the dentist anytime during the day and she gets cleanings 4 times a year
[1:44:38] Versatildoom: My dentist has a thing. Gives you 2 yearly cleanings, x rays, and I think 10% off any needed procedures
[1:44:43] Alannalouwho: thats smart
[1:44:51] kynlaeh: and the dentist only has so many patients and you can text or call them
[1:45:02] lintliquor: I get great insurance from my employer and STILL get screwed over lol
[1:45:07] Alannalouwho: @Versatildoom yeah! ours too :D
[1:45:16] GreenArrowed: @lintliquor yup
[1:45:28] GreenArrowed: yeeeaaa
[1:45:56] itsparvati: thats where trusting your dr comes in huge. trusting they wont tell you do spend on unneeded things
[1:46:26] GreenArrowed: finding the right doctor that will do that can take a long time, tho
[1:46:54] momentum1986: I’ve had patients who end up in my icu because they held off treatment for cracked teeth etc and got a dental abscess that impaired breathing. one icu stay is like $10k per night…
[1:47:00] itsparvati: i would hope any dr knowing you are self pay would have that in mind
[1:47:04] witchhobbit: LUL
[1:47:16] Perkolate: whats the 10.2.6 thingy
[1:47:22] lintliquor: I've been crocheting a lot?
[1:47:23] Alannalouwho: i got the legendary recently and im stoked about it :D
[1:47:31] carterblueman: Why gnome
[1:47:31] MrHella: Audio book series called The Primal Hunter, great for MMO players
[1:47:32] witchhobbit: umm...food? we can always talk about food
[1:47:33] TotallyNotRaien: most of my thoughts are morbid and heavy or simply nothing, so im screwed here
[1:47:38] JustFrogging: my husband and I are adopting a hamster soon
[1:47:40] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: your hair pink
[1:47:44] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: today
[1:47:56] GreenArrowed: aw hamster
[1:48:05] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: do you have wigs?
[1:48:06] JustFrogging: ooooooo I'm doing that now
[1:48:07] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[1:48:07] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:48:10] TotallyNotRaien: give the hamster a huge wonderland of a cage please
[1:48:16] carterblueman: Do you play yordle in league
[1:48:16] TotallyNotRaien: those are awesome
[1:48:19] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: i have a pet turtle
[1:48:26] Alannalouwho: i like the pink hair, its super cute
[1:48:27] momentum1986: and one of those exercise balls
[1:48:34] witchhobbit: vhen vill you vear vigs
[1:48:35] GreenArrowed: awww turtles
[1:48:38] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: well i just got him
[1:48:40] GreenArrowed: i want a pet
[1:48:45] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: he adorable
[1:49:19] sence_00: oh Im so tempted to get a cat wheel
[1:49:19] kynlaeh: i have one for my cats
[1:49:21] kynlaeh: they love it
[1:49:31] TotallyNotRaien: i wanna see a fox on a giant hamsterwheel
[1:49:31] carterblueman: Hamster wheel is m!
[1:49:31] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: i got an estaminte ( cant spell im sorry) of his age it says 2 years old.
[1:49:35] BoogiePonderosa: i recently learned it's illegal in Belgium to own just one hamster
[1:49:36] carterblueman: M+
[1:49:37] momentum1986: maybe the squirrels in my back yard will run on one
[1:49:42] GreenArrowed: uhumans do use treadmills
[1:49:43] Alannalouwho: @kynlaeh awww lucky, i want one
[1:49:46] ahnn112: if velen has a million fans im one of them, if velen only has one its me, if velen has 0 fans im dead
[1:49:54] kynlaeh: i dont
[1:49:55] lintliquor: I tried getting my horses a huge ball to play with and it was a bust lol
[1:49:55] GreenArrowed: there are humans who LIKE running
[1:49:57] Versatildoom: I'd definitely use a giant hamster wheel if I came across one in the woods
[1:49:58] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: i got him in jan 6 of this year and i think since then he grew half a in
[1:49:59] kynlaeh: id rather go outside
[1:50:05] jangleplume: double dare!
[1:50:11] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: he a yellow bellied slider turtle
[1:50:20] momentum1986: no. they do not. those that say they like treadmills are lying to themselves and to you
[1:50:32] cashthb: just set up some alpine scenery on your apple vision pro
[1:50:47] GreenArrowed: yea that's why i have one
[1:51:03] BoogiePonderosa: i appreciate but do not like treadmills
[1:51:06] TotallyNotRaien: i dont even like walking, its only bearable when i have an objective or destination so treadmills are death
[1:51:12] momentum1986: I only run when being chased. and I avoid being chased.
[1:51:25] the_arcantis: I live in Sweden and as much as I am a winter person...having a treadmill for days I don't wish to go outside would be ideal.
[1:51:29] GreenArrowed: i bought a walking pad to keep at my desks o i can walk while i work
[1:51:33] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: had him for a month. i named him Michelangelo mikey for short
[1:51:33] saga_no: ......aaaaand back
[1:51:36] witchhobbit: in the city, the treadmill is better. outside the city, i'm walking outside for the nature
[1:51:57] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: love the ninja turtles lol
[1:52:46] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: i be right bACK
[1:52:53] witchhobbit: walking/jogging/running outside is not that enjoyable in my part of the city
[1:52:56] breezythatnotsogoodgamer: back sorry hit the caps
[1:52:56] DoctorOgenki: can you bike to a trail?
[1:52:57] TotallyNotRaien: really? for me getting my heart rate up gives me anxiety, which coincidentally also raises my heart rate
[1:53:03] mokorii: I wish I had a car, I live in Calgary so I'm so close to the rockies
[1:53:04] 7thSaga: jimblesDrive
[1:53:32] witchhobbit: same, afraid to use a bike in the city
[1:53:33] 7thSaga: LUL Hazel
[1:53:36] kynlaeh: i found the PNW as a whole much more biker friendly than the miidwest
[1:53:48] pongo72: Where did the green hair go <3
[1:53:52] HazelNuttyGames: !wig
[1:53:52] Streamlabs: it's a wig
[1:54:09] TotallyNotRaien: the idea of having a bus drive by me while biking is a big nope
[1:54:10] jeffdmk: your hair grows so fast
[1:54:31] TotallyNotRaien: grows so fast and dyes so well too
[1:54:42] kynlaeh: wait stupid question, is Victoria considered PNW? or does PNW only describe those US states/cities?
[1:54:44] TotallyNotRaien: her hair grows like play doh
[1:54:57] Kinraeel: I much more preferred SL when it comes to collectibles etc. DF feels so empty :(
[1:55:10] kynlaeh: i wasnt sure cuz its kind of southwest canada
[1:55:12] kynlaeh: that makes sense
[1:55:27] TotallyNotRaien: SL collectibles are a pain to get afterwards tho
[1:55:51] itsparvati: i mean, there really arent northern canadians
[1:56:07] itsparvati: you all live south, no cities up there
[1:56:17] kynlaeh: they deserve a badge, very cold
[1:56:27] jeffdmk: are those cities?
[1:56:33] DoctorOgenki: we americans cant comprehend being from the south of a country but still being north of 49 of our states
[1:56:57] forebringer: they aren't provinces thou
[1:57:04] saga_no: @DoctorOgenki I mean.... Americans who live in the lower 48 also *forget* that Alaska exists, so.. there is that
[1:57:28] DoctorOgenki: LuL
[1:57:48] itsparvati: @saga_no some americans forget anything outside the 48 exists
[1:57:55] saga_no: True.
[1:58:17] GreenArrowed: yes
[1:58:20] itsparvati: us
[1:58:25] itsparvati: they are us citizens
[1:58:35] GreenArrowed: you can go there
[1:58:36] GreenArrowed: yes
[1:58:36] jeffdmk: you can go live there no problem
[1:58:38] itsparvati: they can move here and vote
[1:58:44] kynlaeh: my friend is from Puerto Rico and i dont think there was any like stuff he has moved there and back several times
[1:58:59] Versatildoom: Don't you still need a passport though to go there if you are a US citizen?
[1:59:01] GreenArrowed: i spent 2 months in PR working
[1:59:08] itsparvati: you do not
[1:59:17] kynlaeh: i dont think so, i went to PR and never had a passport check
[1:59:26] itsparvati: it is still the US, free travel
[1:59:34] TotallyNotRaien: PR still cant vote in US elections right?
[1:59:37] saga_no: I suppose the passport would only indicate that you are a US citizen
[1:59:45] itsparvati: @TotallyNotRaien not if they live in PR
[1:59:57] itsparvati: but they can move to FL and vote
[2:00:04] TotallyNotRaien: why is that?
[2:00:10] itsparvati: cuz they are us citizens
[2:00:24] saga_no: US citizen - but also need a US residency to vote - I think?
[2:00:26] kynlaeh: i know a lot of PR move to orlando area so they can vote and be involved
[2:00:32] TotallyNotRaien: i mean why cant they vote while in pr? do US laws not apply in PR?
[2:00:53] itsparvati: only states get to vote in national elections, its part of being a state
[2:01:00] saga_no: Isn't there some law that says you can only vote on American soil or something like that?
[2:01:08] GreenArrowed: you don't need a passport to go to US territories fi you're a US citizen. PR are US citizens and don't need passports to come to the mainland.
[2:01:10] kynlaeh: hazel do you like mexican food?  if so whats your fave mexican dish
[2:01:17] TotallyNotRaien: thats so weird
[2:01:41] GreenArrowed: US citizens can vote absentee for their states while living in PR
[2:01:53] GreenArrowed: PR can't vote bc they're not a state
[2:02:02] quickstew: PR doesn't have federal representation in the House or Senate and they don't have electors for presidential elections
[2:02:07] 7thSaga: TACOS <3
[2:02:09] quickstew: They can vote in PR local elections
[2:02:11] kynlaeh: like tacos with corn tortillas and cilantro and onion or like flour tortillas with lettuce and cheese
[2:02:11] TotallyNotRaien: but theyre US territory right?
[2:02:16] heldtheline: According to wowhead, the next assault is in about 7 hours.
[2:02:26] 7thSaga: enchiladas's Kreygasm
[2:02:33] GreenArrowed: @TotallyNotRaien yes but they hae no federal representation
[2:02:34] jessetenfour: hi hazel, what you up to?
[2:02:36] kynlaeh: im a fan of street tacos with the cilantro and onion
[2:02:44] TotallyNotRaien: weird
[2:03:04] GreenArrowed: they have raised a vote to become a state many times
[2:03:18] 7thSaga: speaking of Tacos Hazel have you ever tried a Indian Taco? (same as any taco but instead of soft or hard shell its frybread) Kreygasm best thing in the world
[2:04:05] itsparvati: now i want naan
[2:04:08] GreenArrowed: now i want indian food, it's been so long
[2:04:10] anker_jym: Do you have a high heat tolerance, since you're talking about Indian food?
[2:04:21] Kinraeel: what was the site i could check collectibles + realms?
[2:04:34] saga_no: I have yet to find a good Indian restaurant here :(
[2:04:45] kynlaeh: have you had malai kofta? its my favourite indian dish
[2:04:45] jangleplume: do you like the spicier (heat) dishes?
[2:04:51] BoogiePonderosa: the nearest indian restaurant is an hour+ drive from me :(
[2:04:55] Kinraeel: yes thank you :)
[2:05:06] witchhobbit: we have a lot of taquerias here and it's my favorite
[2:05:16] kynlaeh: theyre my favourite
[2:05:17] kynlaeh: so good
[2:05:21] saga_no: My favorite is Chana Masala
[2:05:31] saga_no: it's vegetarian (maybe even vegan)
[2:05:32] GreenArrowed: banana pakora are my fave
[2:05:38] BoogiePonderosa: LUL
[2:05:48] kynlaeh: i agree! indian food is what helped me transition to vegetarian when i decided i wanted to
[2:05:52] Mr_fantastic123: @HazelNuttyGames if u read her quest text shes being melted down by the moonkin
[2:05:53] kryptogirrl: hello!!!
[2:05:56] witchhobbit: @saga_no that is with chickpeas right? that is my favorite, although i love lentils too
[2:05:57] jangleplume: saag paneer is wonderful
[2:06:02] saga_no: I don't care much about vegetarian/vegan food for myself - I just love the flavor of Chana Masala
[2:06:13] saga_no: @witchhobbit Yep - chickpea stew of sorts
[2:06:13] kryptogirrl: what are you doing? never been to that place I guess hahaha
[2:06:17] kynlaeh: i had a mango coconut curry with chickpeas that was great with naan
[2:06:35] BoogiePonderosa: get dat blood!
[2:06:48] GreenArrowed: i used to work for a vegan food company where almost everything was made with chickpeas so. i haven't eaten chickpeas that aren't in falafel form since i left there.
[2:07:01] BigD530: there's an Indian-fusion pizza place around here which has my favorite Chicken Tikka Masala Pizza
[2:07:09] witchhobbit: i just had a burrito last night with chicken tinga, i want it again lol
[2:07:17] kryptogirrl: which mount?
[2:07:29] Balkov_WG: chickpeas are love chickpeas are life
[2:08:13] saga_no: When I still worked as a secretary for a research company in my hometown, I was tasked with setting up the Christmas Party for our department. A good chunk of employees had various dietary needs, so I had the catering company make Chana Masala (because of the spices being kinda christmas-y) as the non-meat/non-pork option and people *loved it*
[2:08:32] GreenArrowed: i'm ordering indian now NotLikeThis
[2:08:37] anker_jym: The green one you get from the quest, the red one you get off a vendor in the order hall, the purple one is a drop from a rare, but I believe the drop chance is quite high if not 100%
[2:08:50] saga_no: I was given flowers and had my office run down by employees from all over the company telling me they could *FINALLY* attend the Christmas Party and actually have food that wasn't just boiled potatoes
[2:08:55] GreenArrowed: the assault part of this questline is so anoying
[2:09:12] kynlaeh: the indian place that i go near me has this chili paneer dish thats paneer mixed with chilis, ginger, garlic, and green onions with a spicy chili sauce and its so good
[2:09:24] saga_no: Norwegian Christmas food is very meat heavy, so anyone who doesn't eat meat or doesn't eat pork would struggle if noone cared to make sure they had a decent dish
[2:09:55] saga_no: I remember it because I had to provide the recipe for the catering company LUL
[2:09:56] Balkov_WG: @saga_no Norwegians dont have any fish? In sweden we have plenty of fish.
[2:10:10] Balkov_WG: For our christmas table, that is.
[2:10:17] cashthb: you could also start last epoch playtrough!
[2:10:21] iammadeofchalk: why did you never make a vid for fyrakk
[2:10:22] saga_no: @Balkov_WG It's more common further north and for office parties most places will usually opt for either pork or lamb because more people prefer that
[2:10:28] TotallyNotRaien: poor lumiere being manhandled like that
[2:10:56] Hippwn: last epoch is similar to diabo games an arpg
[2:11:06] cashthb: it's an arpg, nothing life changing, but got basics right - thus far, I'm only @ chapter 4/12
[2:11:12] kynlaeh: dont worry, take your time. dont feel too rushed
[2:11:13] saga_no: @Balkov_WG Basically: The North/Arctic will usually eat more fish; the West will eat more lamb; the inland and East favors pork more for Christmas dinner
[2:11:44] luscasg0y: literally my adhd life
[2:11:48] witchhobbit: same lol
[2:12:01] 7thSaga: jimblesCD
[2:12:08] Balkov_WG: @saga_no Interesting!
[2:12:15] kynlaeh: i was afraid it was making you beat yourself up cuz its been mentioned increasingly recently
[2:12:26] kynlaeh: which is very important too
[2:12:29] witchhobbit: my aunt always thought it was the best way to deal with me, it just made me annoyed lol
[2:12:39] saga_no: @Balkov_WG I'm from the Middle of the country - and grew up with pork as the standard Christmas dinner :)
[2:13:33] saga_no: But is it irrational *to you* ?
[2:13:50] saga_no: I feel that is partly the problem sometimes - others find it irrational - but to me it's completely rational
[2:14:00] kynlaeh: im also chronically there, especially with projects and i tend to beat myself up when i should have just done it
[2:14:23] TotallyNotRaien: at least youre doing right by you mentally
[2:14:44] kynlaeh: youre right that probably was a bad term to use there
[2:14:49] heldtheline: I have demand avoidance so getting stuff done is a constant struggle :(
[2:14:52] witchhobbit: oh yeah i know when i'm being irrational or just like very aware of what would help me with my mental health but LUL
[2:15:07] saga_no: Shoulda Woulda Coulda
[2:15:24] kynlaeh: t swift
[2:16:02] TotallyNotRaien: i just resigned myself to the weekly quests
[2:16:34] SaraDivine: they call that the case of the "shoulds." i know someone had said that it can help to change it to a want - do you want to do the thing.
[2:16:46] anker_jym: Azerothian Archives was unfortunately the first public event I only did the intro quests for, and then completely dropped it. I just don't have any interest in it
[2:17:01] Phenroi: I cannot WAIT for account wide rep (among other accountwide stuff)
[2:17:09] SaraDivine: lol
[2:17:46] cashthb: your problem is that you can afford to procrastinate imo
[2:17:53] cashthb: why would you do anything when you can just not
[2:18:01] TotallyNotRaien: i think a lot of things not being retroactive is kind of fair considering their limitions with the game being so old and all
[2:18:11] itsparvati: i dont understand how to get charges on the war within mount
[2:18:43] kynlaeh: i procrastinate and i cant afford to which pushes me to do it last minute, without it i would procrastinate infinitely
[2:19:00] sence_00: @itsparvati ya you have to build "static" by flying near stuff
[2:19:00] SaraDivine: i've been "working" on the insane title for 6 years. which makes me think that there's a lot of reps that would just not work well in that way.
[2:19:11] DoctorOgenki: id love account wide drake/wyrm crest achievements, having to still use lower crests to upgrade alt gear is  ResidentSleeper
[2:19:35] jessetenfour: Glad i dont look at things that way, i always get excited
[2:19:55] bobbab5: @itsparvati You can't, it has a different ability in its place
[2:20:01] heldtheline: every time I read the forums, I always have Tali saying the ol 'it was a sh*tshow, obviously' playing in my head
[2:20:16] Phenroi: Outside of account wide rep, the account wide transmog will be one of the best things coming (imo)
[2:20:25] witchhobbit: @heldtheline same LUL
[2:20:52] Yenma57: we need a massive increase to drop chances of everything, there is so much we can farm now and 1% is insane
[2:21:29] saga_no: I finally finished the Gilneas quests today
[2:21:39] cashthb: @Yenma57 absolutely not
[2:21:45] witchhobbit: my main issue is long spawn timers (i guess with the terribly low drop rates)
[2:21:49] saga_no: And finished the trading post for the month
[2:22:05] Phenroi: @Yenma57 Or at least cumulative drop chances so that the 1 in 100 chance goes up by 1 (2 in 100) up until it becomes a 100% drop chance
[2:22:13] eternitycrystal: dont you ever wanna finish collecting?
[2:22:17] TotallyNotRaien: we need farms to be easier in that you dont have to clear a full raid to get to the mount drop
[2:22:17] ImperfectDark: as a newish collector I feel like I’m more motivated by how rare these things are :D
[2:22:20] Hippwn: I don't like the 1% drops on the holidays thought they just feel horrible
[2:22:21] Marmoh: Hazel, I have a crush on a guildie, how do I make it go away?
[2:22:22] kynlaeh: i think more people would have a lot more mounts and some mounts would feel less special
[2:22:24] RTSLightning: As someone who despises Greymane, does the Horde version of Gilneas make me interact with him at all
[2:22:31] cashthb: also if they makes farm faster 'cause "we have so much to farm" ,we'll run out of farms faster
[2:22:42] tiyanigean: I am fine with 1% mounts. but the really old raids need (partial) skips for endboss mounts. like they did wid SoO
[2:22:55] Yenma57: @Phenroi yeah this is a good solution, i dont want 500 attempts at invincible lol
[2:22:58] saga_no: Does the Guildie know?
[2:23:03] JackOnline: picture them in a bad tmog
[2:23:14] Marmoh: LOL
[2:23:18] shaypressplay: I had a crush on a guildie 13 years ago and married him
[2:23:33] TotallyNotRaien: delude yourself into thinking their horrible people
[2:23:36] heldtheline: Spend more time with them, eventually you might get bored with them?
[2:23:37] sence_00: imo - realize you dont know much about them, since you only know them online your mind is filling in a LOT of blanks
[2:23:39] itsparvati: is there a reason why the crush needs to end? are they unavailable?
[2:23:41] DoctorOgenki: ya just get married, crush solved
[2:23:49] Marmoh: @saga_no Never haha
[2:23:59] LuckeyAtel: @shaypressplay Same.
[2:24:14] cashthb: what if you're into bad boys/girls tho?
[2:24:22] SaraDivine: i think of guild crushes in a similar vein of highschool sweethearts. the success rate is quite low and causes turmoil in friend groups
[2:24:32] itsparvati: getting married does not solve crushes, sadly
[2:24:34] shaypressplay: @LuckeyAtel I love that!
[2:24:38] RTSLightning: Ask them a political question, 50% chance they eliminate themselves as an option in your brain
[2:24:38] saga_no: @Marmoh Is there any reason for this crush to be a bad thing? Is the guildie in a relationship? Married? if not - ....just have fun with it
[2:25:07] TotallyNotRaien: just realize youre infatuated by them and not actually in love
[2:25:13] Marmoh: @saga_no Honestly, very very fair
[2:25:40] cashthb: @saga_no is kinda correct
[2:25:47] ivashkov92: @hazelnuttygames Are you excited for hero talents or not really?
[2:26:10] kynlaeh: im excited to see the cosmetics but not the actual skills lol
[2:26:13] ivashkov92: I feel like until i play with the talents I can’t decide if it’s great or not
[2:26:16] saga_no: @Marmoh If they never know about it - the worst thing that'll happen is that they get themselves a partner at some point - and then you'll either be over the crush, or you'll feel a little bad for a while (but since they didn't KNOW you were crushing on them in the first place - it's not *their* fault...)
[2:26:29] TotallyNotRaien: hero talents, just kinda exist, not really there to carry a whole expansion off the concept alone
[2:27:24] sence_00: Im just worried the hero talents wont actually be ready for Alpha like they wanted
[2:27:29] ivashkov92: I wonder if they will add to them in future expansions to flesh them out and add more to the fantasy or just one day integrate them into the standard tree..
[2:27:44] cashthb: honestly they are only there 'cause they didn't know how to extend the shitty talent trees
[2:27:45] Hippwn: hero talents feel like covenants again where you will have two abilities and instead of picking the theme you like you will need to pick the ones that are the "good" ones.
[2:27:55] Ysarahhh: im more excited for prepatch for warbands than the acutal expansion tbh
[2:27:55] Marmoh: @saga_no I guess I'm a proponent for enjoying that feeling without overinflating it. But it's getting harder :p
[2:28:03] cashthb: they could and should have just brought back the old format
[2:28:30] saga_no: @Marmoh It's that age-old saying (that we all hate) "it'll get worse before it gets better"
[2:28:35] itsparvati: i want to know more about the lore of the xpac
[2:28:47] TotallyNotRaien: i want flight form dynamic flight
[2:28:51] galdrelvolkfire: Hi Hazel!
[2:29:03] heldtheline: I'm pleased about the fact that delves are solo-friendly, with them and follower dungeons it feels like wow is finally recognising how many people play solo
[2:29:49] sence_00: will you play the alpha if you get access? I know the beta ptr was making you nauseous in df
[2:30:27] sence_00: feels like its coming up fast
[2:30:42] itsparvati: as a content creator, you kind of HAVE to play alpha if you have it
[2:30:50] Stormcrone: yes, all these solo-friendly options are great
[2:30:55] TotallyNotRaien: yeah no wonder theyre going for shorter expacs
[2:31:00] ivashkov92: When is alpha out? or is it already?
[2:31:27] jeffdmk: @ivashkov92 it is possible hazel knows and cant say
[2:31:34] sence_00: roadmap shows between 10.2.6 and S4 we'll get alpha
[2:31:57] sence_00: who knows how accurate the graphic is tho!
[2:32:13] cashthb: my issue with delves is that it's prolly gonna be a thorghast is situation, where some classes will have a wildly different experience - and it's not gonna be the mages that will have it easy
[2:32:19] ivashkov92: @jeffdmk This is true.
[2:33:01] ivashkov92: @hazelnuttygames If only I could do that for my own life, a person roadmap 😂
[2:33:29] cashthb: can't you just get a house with fragments? did you ask the realestate agents?
[2:33:59] cashthb: how many fragments?
[2:34:33] Yenma57: How was your DF experience on a scale 1 - 10
[2:35:41] ivashkov92: it’ll definitely be looked back as one of the greats of WoW for she s
[2:35:52] ivashkov92: for sure*
[2:36:00] TotallyNotRaien: wait did you refund it? it has a time limit
[2:36:07] Alannalouwho: yay ty for streaming, have a good day
