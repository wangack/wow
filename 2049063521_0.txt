[1:58:38] Somemodsaretools: its hard to think of how to get healers in
[1:58:50] Somemodsaretools: like its a lot of things combined not just rewards
[1:58:53] ValathEU: I play every healer but mw and evoker - I refuse to touch shuffle because im insta in 40% damp and 2.2 players havent heard of earthen totem yet
[1:58:55] Fogged: im excited to try some stuff ,feel like mage is gona be very nice at 40
[1:58:55] scjutz: Healers get reward but its so trash
[1:59:00] Fogged: for sod* oops
[1:59:09] Wrathbb1: THEY SHOULD ADD A MOUNT JUST FOR HITTING 2K ON HEALS
[1:59:13] dankent130: going 4 and 2 getting 2 rating is why healers don’t like to queue

[1:59:44] NightMunchies: healers need more time than dps
[1:59:45] joyrex_j9: they aren't going to trick dps players into healing for rewards
[1:59:48] scjutz: i mean, when i play healer its always 3-3 and + 0 rating so that makes it trash tbh
[1:59:57] jaycob_xo: i love watching people not press defensives, LOS and not interrupt and then say "one heal"
[1:59:58] chirsen: @scjutz yip thats completly disgusting too
[1:59:59] antwonjr69: healers are more difficult to play then dps
[2:00:06] NightMunchies: exactly

[5:06:13] irlEric: i was at the strip club w one of my guy friends and a friend who is a girl, there was a stripper from a city i used to live in. we talked n i made her laugh n she thought i was cute. said she was off soon and i asked if she wanted to hang out. I disctinctly remember her, she drove a lincoln navigator,  started a lingerie business. i didnt want her to know where i live to so i suggested we go to hotel. we went to hotel, she showered, we banged, she gave me a massage n we went to bed. next morning
