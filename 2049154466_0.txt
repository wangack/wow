[0:24:15] nutz_hang_uneven: 2020
[0:24:17] wackpoetic: Twitch Turbo isn't as much value as YouTube Premium but still better than some streaming services. My only complaint is that at some point Twitch broke Chromecasting from my Desktop I've tried everything
[0:24:24] nikthevoker: remember the dollar menu
[0:24:26] Xeliumimar: Subway cost me like 11-12$ for a footlong

[0:24:41] xilyx2: that was university fuel
[0:24:43] Fatcher: is there not a formal broadcast for this or is that the next rounds
[0:24:47] wackpoetic: although apparently they added a foot long cookie recently...
[0:24:48] malvarcla: subway most populated fast food in USA
[0:24:48] Cocoapuffs1: they're*
[0:24:50] Cafe0le: YEP
[0:24:52] slicesym: will the open bracket be streamed?
[0:24:52] nutz_hang_uneven: everything costs more because comapnys realized everyone will pay a price increase

[0:25:21] nikthevoker: ya subway here is dirty af
[0:25:22] ion82: old school subway was way better
[0:25:24] Babsx0: i don't think hpriest would have looked so bad if he played lightweaver instead of divine image
[0:25:24] Jubite: lock porting to the middle of the map didnt work great
[0:25:24] xilyx2: why tf did they swap
[0:25:26] betasoldier: @venruki Do you think we will see any Devoker's this weekend?

[0:26:31] SammyLettuce: every fast food place is taxin now
[0:26:31] KJBirl: its because of the stupid rewards system
[0:26:33] obviouslytai: yea mdees went up a lot
[0:26:35] wackpoetic: McDonalds could charge whatever they want if they brought back all-day breakfast
[0:26:38] kloudykloudd: its definitely NOT worth the price now lol
[0:26:39] zartorak: wendys 4 for 4 is where its at
[0:26:39] xilyx2: its because our food approval is a bit more intense in Canada
[0:26:41] macdeezyx: chick fil a is so expensive now
[0:26:42] KJBirl: they have to make money for the "free stuff" they give away on the app

[1:37:29] enjoythewalk: @hamsti no cause he is toxic crusader jr
[1:37:33] Metaphors: I hope I see some venruki destro shuffles soon.
[1:37:36] hamsti: this bracket UI is slightly bizarre
[1:37:39] flalia4: these up and comers "echo" may be worth keeping an eye on
[1:37:42] addyz0r: I'm suprised. Echo top eight? :o
[1:37:52] psychic241: didn't luxia play wit bicmex before?

[1:38:08] Baconeggcheese: He's gonna.. destruki them
[1:38:10] lordelenath: seeing echo at the top is like seeing FC Bayern in Germany at the top of the football league.

[1:38:16] ishbuux: metaphors would never lose on any class
[1:38:19] Metaphors: the metric is u getting ran down by a warrior with a hpriest healing u
[1:38:20] marvin1995xo: stream in 480p
[1:38:22] tangell0s: @Jubite feral has instincts at least, but the problem is that they have bear form, so it means giving more defensive options can be exacerbated by that.
[1:38:24] chaps_86: you're really good at both aff and demo, you'll farm on destro after a few games.
[1:38:32] Nekdoo: who wants a sub, first gets it
[1:38:34] revzzz1: LUL LUL :D

[1:38:45] DJ_HappyDays: we saw destro hpri today right? didnt they win some games
[1:38:46] Jubite: @tangell0s id rather see bear not be as good an option and introduce new options
[1:38:46] maybethistimepls: clyde is in a game
[1:38:47] Carlleque: fixed
[1:38:49] not_jsn: seeing echo at the top is like seeing coca cola in mcdonalds at the top of the fast food league

[1:38:53] tedo781: I think destro has highest first blood rate in shuffle but that’s mainly cuz people focus it or they die to it’s dam

[1:42:07] ivanvolkovi: <3 <3 <3
[1:42:09] xilyx2: i feel like you cant expect great results if you don't multi-class now
[1:42:23] Ameratzu: @kreyzy8 the real meta is do swaps permanently, look at whaaz game. it lokked like they wanted to kill the dragon and they ended up killing the druid
[1:42:31] What_ln_Tarnation: makes sense
[1:42:32] Baconeggcheese: If you don't die, you live
[1:42:44] vmewo: @xilyx2 yeah with how solved wow arena is thats very true
[1:42:52] Relyst: rogue is eternal
[1:42:53] lordelenath: a comp needs to be super-powerful to not need multiclassing, right?
[1:42:54] vmewo: I mean theyre playing rogue
[1:42:54] yepx1: just play rmp
[1:42:55] Jubite: people solo classing and are still top 10 teams in the world
[1:42:56] chaps_86: ie:rogues
[1:43:03] xilyx2: yea but MOST specs fluctuate in power
[1:43:04] Baconeggcheese: rogue world championships
[1:43:05] storm_chaser_ron: Isn't it really _just_ rogue
[1:43:08] kreyzy8: tbf whaazz only played boomy last season
[1:43:09] DeityRevert: MULTIPASS
[1:43:09] Vinnarn: yet whaazz woin last awc as boomie :D
[1:43:10] Ezflex11: Do rogue melee cleaves work rn?
[1:43:13] lordelenath: not everybody needs to multiclass, but you need some ppl on your team to do it.
[1:43:14] diskmachin1: but you have to play all speccs, doesnt rat only play sub?
[1:43:16] dpsEric: they don't even multispec though, which is even worse than not multiclassing
[1:43:16] Relyst: even when rogues have to multiclass, its to like WW or something LUL
[1:43:16] vmewo: I mean you should at leasta have to multi spec as a rogue haha but it seems like Rat just really prefers sub
[1:43:18] Esotraz: Susge hunter with fyrak wepp
[1:43:18] storm_chaser_ron: what other class doesn't have to multiclass (if they want to play)
[1:43:18] bobbybigbuxx: playing a druid is multiclassing

[2:31:57] Msv2: xD
[2:31:57] poroyou: for the faster ticks

[2:31:58] Vigi9413: does OCE not get into AWC? or if they do who do they bracket then with
[2:32:00] jawst3k: there’s a talent for keeping it on yourself

[2:32:07] its_bean92: @Fury73 Blizzard doesnt pay for streaming lol
[2:32:12] Msv2: I stun druids without bloom and can get them to below half before they come out
[2:32:15] zachgamegodx: Luxia didn’t play retail again till a few weeks ago
[2:32:23] altilla187: it heals more if you have one on yourself
[2:32:25] Esotraz: i mean they prob figured out hes 52% vers or something
[2:32:27] Pradathelord: i also think the 3x clones just drained luuxia too
[2:32:29] bobbybigbuxx: 52% vers DH is bait af
[2:32:31] Esotraz: i wouldnt touch that
[2:32:33] DougyfreshGG: i think the bloom ticks faster and you get more clearcasting maybe
[2:32:34] DeityRevert: he's sitting all the ccs

[2:32:53] lowluds: what makes a dh so immune?
[2:32:57] kyriewow: why is he not going stealth and drink
[2:33:01] comfyslayer: bfa
[2:33:01] rainmannxz: Same.
[2:33:07] chaps_86: how did he drink with treants up
[2:33:13] nezz231: and do full dmg while immune aswell.. stupid
[2:33:16] Esotraz: im still in shock that arcane and dh didnt get a nerf this latest hotfix
[2:33:16] Baconeggcheese: depends on if its passive or not imo
[2:33:19] Jubite: you have to cancel the treants
[2:33:20] its_bean92: @Fury73 if anything hes an independent contractor
[2:33:22] maybethistimepls: @chaps_86 bugs out sometimes
[2:33:23] chaps_86: since when

[2:33:31] fatulina: boring
[2:33:33] Msv2: Shadowmeld right?
[2:33:35] Msv2: No
[2:33:35] Jubite: also you keep bloom on self cuz it makes your hots tick 20% faster
[2:33:37] Msv2: Or nah?
[2:33:39] jdot117: is arcane really that tanky? havent played since the patch so real question
[2:33:41] chaps_86: even meld keeps you in combat
[2:33:44] face2face: Maybe watch from mvq POV
[2:33:45] mstr_shake: resto druid pov is just boring
[2:33:45] beeyank: man EU always has shamans
[2:33:46] chaps_86: with treants up
[2:33:48] Baconeggcheese: Needs more ww games
[2:33:49] face2face: A bit more entertaining than rdru POV
[2:33:53] bobbybigbuxx: its peekaboo healer game
[2:33:53] krisdahaka: at least is not a caster mirror, lol
[2:33:55] KralHor: i mean its a mirror, it should be that even
[2:33:59] BMaStream: Would there be an argument for the DH to run adapt since they are more than likely the CC target?
[2:33:59] What_ln_Tarnation: they should just start these games at 40% damp
[2:34:02] Vigi9413: it’s not boring it’s a mirror
[2:34:04] kyriewow: well, they are just losing mana wise
[2:34:08] CoAco95: yea maybe mvq pov is more fun
[2:34:11] Baconeggcheese: Yeah that's true, swap to mvq pov?
[2:34:22] ram13ll: Hey Ven, do you know if F tier are gonna play again? became their fan instantly last comp hehe
[2:34:25] fatulina: 2-1 for ?
[2:34:31] hadoukyn: swapxy
[2:34:55] peacant: what happens when you keep nerfing dmg and everyone has short defensive cds
[2:35:20] Pradathelord: @peacant yep
[2:35:20] jawst3k: Passive magic dam reduc it’s good tho
[2:35:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they wouldn't be this tough with a different healer
[2:35:25] heymomimonttv: i wish ele was tanky for me when i played it
[2:35:26] Relyst: 2% mana Pog
[2:35:34] tonymoltana: 3/4 of the chat would lose in 5s
[2:35:35] Msv2: Not enough
[2:35:41] Baconeggcheese: Feel like you swap this to any other healer and the games insta 50% shorter
[2:35:42] Esotraz: dw hes gonna tripple clone now to lose all the mana PepeLaugh
[2:35:51] DeityRevert: dmg is way closer this time
[2:35:51] BMaStream: @venruki  Do you think it could be worth for the DH to run adapt in this matchup?
[2:35:51] ridder30: he is giga oom
[2:35:52] Vigi9413: how far into dampen will they go
[2:35:58] fatulina: look the dmg, all the same T_T
[2:36:09] krisdahaka: swapxy healing more than jayme again
[2:36:13] eainzsp: no one seems to like rduid metas, but what healer meta would be the most fun?
[2:36:22] everlastingsummerw: he didn't have enough mana to refresh the bloom
[2:36:22] fistweaveurnan: DH has a better chance of soloing a healer than it does dying. Disgusting pig of a class.
[2:36:22] lordelenath: disc priest
[2:36:24] krisdahaka: there's the diff
[2:36:26] Esotraz: i rather have rdruid meta
[2:36:27] bobbybigbuxx: hes oom af no innervate they lose
[2:36:27] jawst3k: priest meta always most exciting
[2:36:28] vmewo: Bloom will pop as long as you refresh it below 4s duration
[2:36:28] heymomimonttv: @eainzsp fistweaver
[2:36:33] xoHOLLOW: that micro drink
[2:36:33] sillysheepweepandsleep: why ven is not playing? I started watching ven when I was 5 years old
[2:36:35] Msv2: FIVE SECONDS
[2:36:38] Esotraz: fistweaver meta is the most boring meta
[2:36:39] Msv2: Off intervate
[2:36:41] Msv2: Omggg
[2:36:41] WhereMaldo: isn’t it if you re apply at less than 5 seconds it blooms
[2:36:42] prex197: @venruki any shadowp teams on na later beside wizk?
[2:36:54] chaps_86: @WhereMaldo correct
[2:36:55] xilyx2: swapxy roots making him change form at low mana is obnoxious af lol
[2:36:55] pattarx: what is this seriesat
[2:37:04] Relyst: a diverse meta where every healer has a comp or two that can succeed
[2:37:06] ATHLTE: @prex197 theres a couple shadowplays i think
[2:37:06] numero5218: everyone wanted to hear that
[2:37:07] WhereMaldo: re-apply lifeblood that is
[2:37:08] Baconeggcheese: does the ww sub team play again
[2:37:11] Baconeggcheese: we need more of that
[2:37:12] scardef: mvqq has comms on still
[2:37:14] Jubite: bloom on self makes it tick 20% faster, wonder if that means more effort to keep them up

[2:38:47] xoHOLLOW: @TzMFk thats a name i havent heard in a  minute. he is actually eu tho lol. just played on us servers
[2:38:51] eainzsp: i think eu has more wizards so naaturally more ele's right or am i crazy
[2:38:51] HoodsShadow: NA has resto sham instead of ele's
[2:38:54] mvpala_tv: its bc NA is historically just melee zerg and historically ele isnt good against it
[2:38:56] GLYFEnation: Mes has benn playing a lot of ele but yeah he's not main a angle.

[2:41:14] hadoukyn: ret
[2:41:15] RelaxBond: why hope no mes? he used to be on every match
[2:41:15] Bombdiggity3315: they are only going to play outlaw, boomie, rsham
[2:41:17] bonaphil: @What_ln_Tarnation Outlaw/Boomy is more likely.
[2:41:25] Esotraz: they could outlaw ret
[2:41:26] Vigi9413: he can play ret
[2:41:27] What_ln_Tarnation: yeah i corrected it
[2:41:31] bonaphil: 0.8s Clone cast with outlaw/boomy is fun.

[2:47:58] jdot117: i predict there will be a lot more warlocks in NA than EU
[2:47:58] armin_ed: I hope to see a cupid team climb the ladder
[2:47:58] kreyzy8: well that makes top 8 I mean
[2:48:01] LichbornHQ: ret in awc ? no shot xd
[2:48:04] vmills: the zug is strong with that team
[2:48:09] hadoukyn: were there any bdks ?
[2:48:13] pattarx: @LichbornHQ cries in season 1
[2:48:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vanguards ret on the ladder is really good
[2:48:17] JNE14: surprising would be someone playing feral druid hahahaha
[2:48:27] Esotraz: we just saw a feral
[2:48:27] indrah___: do you think we will keep seeing ww monk?
[2:48:34] orianrrrr: There's just legit no DH/eles that queue on NA
[2:48:35] rekt1370: ret war ret dh not too bad rn
[2:48:38] fistweaveurnan: Not shocking after seeing DH replace every other spec in any comp it wants while remaining unkillable and having the highest sustain
[2:48:50] Shek_shas: Hi Ven when did it start ?
[2:48:52] Senseixww: ww best comp is with a rogue ngl
[2:48:52] DiscoSlim: world of roguecraft
[2:48:53] Esotraz: ww dh Pog
[2:48:59] PastaSeat: @fistweaveurnan DH is incredibly hard to play. You NEED to have at least 200 IQ to play DH well bro
[2:48:59] pattarx: ret dh is an insane comp. reverse + sanc makes it so tough to cc healer
[2:49:07] mayfire15: they just had to nerf dk..
[2:49:15] flames222: it kind of sucks that they did class balancing soo close to awc, kind of throws a wrench in some teams
[2:49:25] vmills: I really really wish they would at least do a light casting of qualifiers
[2:49:36] pattarx: @mayfire15 dk is great even if not in awc my guy. look at ladder representation. dk is #2 behind dh for melee specs
[2:49:36] gamblinfoo: can't wait to watch Mies'
[2:49:45] spellgunx: a lot of mage locks so far
[2:49:51] Msv2: Me2
[2:49:55] buffevoker: Mies winning awc will be so sick
[2:49:58] hadoukyn: yeah watchparties are fun
[2:49:58] mayfire15: @pattarx didn’t say it wasn’t good enough for ladder
[2:50:01] B0ost3d: i love the watch party here in stream
[2:50:02] JNE14: @venruki don't you miss being in the competition?
[2:50:03] Scudbomb: Are you casting this AWC?
[2:50:04] goesidd: ye ever since they added watch parties its cool
[2:50:06] gamblinfoo: @buffevoker  it will be LEGENDARY!
[2:50:06] SihillSP: @fistweaveurnan hard cap
[2:50:06] Esotraz: please no @buffevoker
[2:50:08] Yoseirl: i like this cause i can watch my fav stramers pov as well
[2:50:09] Cafe0le: Wish we had comms in the awc too, and the caster reacting to them LUL
[2:50:13] vmills: true and you are my favorite caster anyways lolol
[2:50:16] Jubite: you can really let loose and say penis
[2:50:21] DiscoSlim: what your best expansion?
[2:50:27] nightmxz: Getting super into the prep can be fun for competing imo
[2:50:28] draglol9: when does na start
[2:50:33] mat4th: casting the open bracket would make it last so long or you would need to hire a couple teams of casters
[2:50:35] jawst3k: do you think you ever would compete again?
[2:50:36] mayfire15: @pattarx we are watching and talking about awc
[2:50:36] Froyha: 3 amigos returning would break the internet
[2:50:38] rekt1370: why are they not on the lock wtf
[2:50:42] buffevoker: Can you just imagine how legendary it will be when ven interviews mies after victory
[2:50:45] gamblinfoo: MoP with 3 amigos was best
[2:51:01] Aramith9: you mean resist gear?
[2:51:02] shrimpsmacker: why is the ad volume so got damn high
[2:51:09] Baconeggcheese: back in my day
[2:51:12] ghanih: It is fine without the casting, but would be nice to have the accessible spectator mode for some people that are allowed
[2:51:17] galdinator: You dont like theorycrafted the best weakauras ?
[2:51:24] clemestos: Hunter moving aimed shots in mist was so good
[2:51:33] i11danzo: !holzkern
[2:51:33] Nightbot: Need a gift for your loved ones for Valentine's Day? Check out Holzkern and make sure to use my code VENRUKI15 for 15% off! http://www.holzkern.com/venruki
[2:51:33] pattarx: @mayfire15 ok so thank god they arent making tuning decisions around this. glad we can agree that dk should be nerfed more
[2:51:34] Pingabreath: back in your day it was resilience
[2:51:35] rekt1370: theorycraft the best weak aura package Pog
[2:51:37] nightmxz: Man if I didn't hate weakuaras so much I could have the most broken shit
[2:51:42] pr0x365: Reckful 3k era FTW
[2:51:43] hadoukyn: games were so much different at lans with no addons that was peak gameplay
[2:51:45] pattarx: lets get some nerf DK in the chat
[2:51:48] Traveler1353: Old grizzled veteran Venruki
[2:52:06] Scudbomb: @pattarx Buff DK
[2:52:14] pattarx: @Scudbomb rip
[2:52:36] revzzz1: :( :(
[2:52:37] Msv2: True
[2:52:39] ultra_content: @venruki  there is someone that got caught cheating during AWC ever?
[2:52:40] Synkz_00: I like that essence bar, anyone know where that's from
[2:52:54] ultra_content: like an istant ROP on dome
[2:52:56] Jubite: would be cooler to release it after the competitive weekend as a resource
[2:53:04] RedeemedbyJesus: I wish they'd fully remove addons from rated pvp and especially AWC. Would be sweet to see who's just good with the raw UI and game knowledge. Ven would be.
[2:53:10] CinematX: clyde
[2:53:10] chaps_86: clyde
[2:53:10] mayfire15: @pattarx ok and dh rogue arcane and ele should be too the

[2:53:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: The ret went down
[2:53:28] peacant: what mog is that!
[2:53:29] ghalsen: Are you competing in AWC? Where can we find the bracket?
[2:53:33] Esotraz: nerf dk ww outlaw arcane :)
[2:53:33] chaps_86: destro shot off like 8 bolts in 10 seconds

[2:53:37] SgtPepperTTV: Ven are you coming to p2 SoD? I think the Mage PvP is going to be insaneeeee would love to see you do your thing
[2:53:37] ultra_content: NERF DISC PRIEST
[2:53:50] helly421: @venruki if you were in the Awc what comp would you want to run?
[2:53:52] ultra_content: too many
[2:53:56] kyriewow: enemy won
[2:54:06] heymomimonttv: omfg an arms warrior
[2:54:11] Malte_L: ßaßa
[2:54:14] fiestawow: what is that huge class icon addon
[2:54:17] krisdahaka: I am gonna be honest, the thing that made me pause on the game for 1 year now, is the amount of mini cc and interrupts that just make you not play the game, addons and the fact that nothing dies until dampeninig hits
[2:54:19] lordelenath: are they allowed to switch up comps in these qualifiers?
[2:54:31] SgtPepperTTV: very nice man, glad to hear it, hope you're doing well!
[2:54:32] heymomimonttv: wowwww retwar no way
[2:54:34] SghettiBoy: No GDKP !
[2:54:39] hadoukyn: @lordelenath ofc
[2:54:39] jawst3k: nerf rmp
[2:54:41] conbarz: i think phase 2 will b a lot of fun... more than phase 1
[2:54:43] overpowered37: "probably" be playing haha... yeah right
[2:54:44] lordelenath: omg ret/war is gonna be so nuked by RMP.
[2:54:53] Malte_L: its onsane how many top teams there are
[2:55:00] jawst3k: no lol
[2:55:03] ultra_content: @conbarz  i hope so i stopped at level 12 watching the "end-game" content of 25 streamers xo
[2:55:06] witchcvlt: is there a link to the bracket anywhere?
[2:55:07] jawst3k: dampener inc
[2:55:13] ultra_content: @conbarz but blood moon events seems more fun
[2:55:21] armin_ed: @lordelenath They can yeah works the same since its awc qualifiers not just rando games
[2:55:22] twinbladeuk: he also rocks terrible mogs indeed
[2:55:22] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Stoichulk WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool

[2:55:42] conbarz: @ultra_content i feel that... was hard for me to invest time into it, knowing that gear will just be replaced... 40 i think itll be worth to gear out
[2:55:46] Kenny_77: RMP vs WRetRdruid is giving me such good vibes
[2:55:53] twinbladeuk: he took panda this to seriously LUL
[2:55:53] Kenny_77: oldschool
[2:55:56] Baconeggcheese: Nelf is love, nelf is life
[2:56:00] SgtPepperTTV: I respect the hell out of the people who stick to their guns and dont re-roll and still preform at a high level
[2:56:07] armin_ed: I cant believe doing holy priest
[2:56:19] Stoichulk: Stoichulk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Thanks for the stream Ruki! Also, my sub ran out when I was out of the house and it was a real bummer watching commercials during the Bicmex games.
[2:56:19] Lestorphs: would you expect to see more holy over disc?
[2:56:35] arcane_p: arcane_p subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! best channel on twitch
[2:56:36] ultra_content: @conbarz same with 40 phase it will be, but  more fun with more spells on that pvp for sure, if they add arenas at 60 as endgame sod could be nice to grind.
[2:56:42] shredder1111: it's a video game, being loyal to a class is dumb imo
[2:56:45] Msv2: Seems good
[2:57:07] gelatokush: Ven is part of the matrix
[2:57:08] Esotraz: fade blind Pog
[2:57:16] jawst3k: md not worth anymore too much mana
[2:57:22] addyz0r: I turb'd last night
[2:57:23] jawst3k: unless it’s insta
[2:57:24] mayfire15: turbo is bis
[2:57:26] kreyzy8: I got turbo too I couldn't deal with it anymore
[2:57:34] SgtPepperTTV: @shredder1111 Understandable, but I think its badass to handicap yourself because you like what you like and preform at a high level
[2:57:46] SteLawBro: I respect the people more who can play any spec at a world class level and adapt to the situation instead of holding their team back on one spec.
[2:57:48] heymomimonttv: turbo is easily the best streaming service out there for me.
[2:58:09] AuT_Stona: BIG AGREE
[2:58:12] Esotraz: TRUE
[2:58:14] twinbladeuk: i had to get turbo i watch to many random streamers, not watched TV in years

[2:58:26] ram13ll: man ..i wish the AWC unit frames would be available to public..they are so clean and nice
[2:58:27] hadoukyn: i've always found amazing how you guys can call this thing live so good
[2:58:29] lordelenath: I hated the DHs for it already and I hate evokers
[2:58:32] jawst3k: good into dbl melee
[2:58:40] lordelenath: time to hate on hpriest iguess
[2:58:49] LichbornHQ: @lordelenath only dk cant
[2:58:53] vmills: what priest talent?
[2:58:57] Baconeggcheese: I respect people who take breakfast seriously, as its the most important meal of the day and shouldn't be neglected
[2:58:58] ultra_content: ????
[2:58:59] armin_ed: Ahh good old fly hacks
[2:58:59] Esotraz: i hate zenlyn for rerolling hpriest absolute fiend Madge
[2:59:02] DiscoSlim: Which expansion do you think you were at your best in terms of skill?
[2:59:04] lordelenath: i thought so until he started flying

[2:59:18] Totesmag0tes: when disc got divine spirit

[2:59:19] pugulus_prime: We need more strong healing specs.
[2:59:29] Totesmag0tes: or w/e
[2:59:29] Xanthem4: SL Holy was unethical
[2:59:30] knadam13: you can still do that
[2:59:30] remofreecss: The Guy is casting heal

[3:12:12] galadice: give treants longer cd also
[3:12:13] sixthycent: where the hpals at????????
[3:12:21] whitewallss: hpriest is super well designed
[3:12:31] wyldeshock: hpriest is so much better to play than disc imo
[3:12:38] gdodmebxu: @galadice i'd rather them remove all the random npcs and make the relevant classes not need them
[3:12:41] CoAco95: give every healer treants YesYes
[3:12:41] whitewallss: they just stink rn and redm is op
[3:12:50] mayfire15: @jubite don’t think there is any sp mains
[3:12:56] JNE14: 2min adds
[3:12:59] galadice: @gdodmebxu fair
[3:13:02] ultra_content: the chastise into fear that u can't avoid is kinda toxic
[3:13:02] JNE14: omg
[3:13:05] lordelenath: hpriest has to cast though. thats whats wrong with it. healers who cast are so 2020 venruki.
[3:13:20] jdot117: villaye was playing shadow priest earlier i think
[3:13:23] Ameratzu: score?
[3:13:34] zeref_qq: CRAZYY
[3:13:34] flames222: you're crazy XD
[3:13:35] LichbornHQ: same as CASTERS but they dont xd
[3:13:35] nezz231: they dont anymore tho LUL
[3:13:43] Jubite: i wonder why the range mana users are called casters
[3:13:58] tastyjustt: this is solo shuffle right
[3:14:05] fusion2102: are u not commentating for the wow youtube anymore?
[3:14:11] SquidSosa: lol
[3:14:13] ultra_content: xo
[3:14:13] belvedee: new angel form for hpriest was a cool addition. lets them cast when they need to.
[3:14:14] LichbornHQ: and ele
[3:14:14] dilsnick: yea, ven has to cast this weekend
[3:14:15] Yaycarrots: FeelsWeirdMan
[3:14:18] lordelenath: not the ones that do well though. ele shaman doesnt cast, destro rarely does
[3:14:22] Pradathelord: ven does have to cast
[3:14:23] galadice: UH DKs also
[3:14:25] Pradathelord: big true
[3:14:29] ultra_content: ret for real tho sometimes
[3:14:30] dmgcurry: ven is a caster who casts awc
[3:14:31] hamsti: not looking good for clydes team
[3:14:32] heymomimonttv: dk and ret are instant casters in plate lol
[3:14:34] americanmoses18: no cast needed when i zug zug
[3:14:36] agent_zeiss: agent_zeiss subscribed with Prime. 
[3:14:37] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy agent_zeiss WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[3:14:40] zeref_qq: they have to cast the hunt
[3:14:41] Babsx0: sanctify
[3:14:43] Pradathelord: heal on floor
[3:14:46] phanabananana: yeah ret is killing the awc so far
[3:14:48] fistweaveurnan: nerf the ever living crap out of dh in every area and tone down outlaw cdr ez game
[3:14:51] filtertips: healer is the hardest role i think on top lvl
[3:15:14] thewordtv: Greater heal woulda been nuts here no cap
[3:15:17] famous1939: what i'm realizing here is i use power word shield too much as holy
[3:15:22] Yaycarrots: annkOhshucks
[3:15:22] ryskfulx: mvq is in a game now
[3:15:24] Pradathelord: i like how the warrior just spins in there
[3:15:26] Pradathelord: hahahah
[3:15:26] ItsBees: Ven can you add me to the mods in discord :3 no rush
[3:15:36] gdodmebxu: rdruid just passively ruining the game Kappa
[3:15:39] lordelenath: I mean if they lose because hes oom thats sorta how this matchup works, right? RMP has to setup kills and if they dont do that well enugh until their healer is oom they didnt play well enough?
[3:16:03] ButtaTWD: it’s interesting that current wow is based on mana even tho classes seem to do a lot of dps
[3:16:05] gdodmebxu: @lordelenath i mean it's because of rdruid though
[3:16:08] demololtv: feel like resto will always win the mana battle
[3:16:08] eainzsp: necessary evil
[3:16:09] nightmxz: They should give healers combo points Kappa
[3:16:21] zachgamegodx: arcane mage that doesnt like mana
[3:16:21] DeityRevert: could just remove dampening 4Head
[3:16:23] dougdimaddome: outlaw/ arcane is a dampener comp its not like they are playing sub fire lol @lordelenath
[3:16:23] Mozaiczny: @nightmxz Holy Paladin?? :D
[3:16:24] Pradathelord: 1:30 trinket and damp every game
[3:16:25] face2face: @gdodmebxu Hpriest is sustaining til oom all the same tho
[3:16:29] f41s3sh3p4rd: hpal has combo points
[3:16:37] gdodmebxu: @gdodmebxu rdruid takes way longer to oom and doesn't have to cast KEKW
[3:16:40] shredder1111: i feel like they should remove mana and crank the damp up
[3:16:42] famous1939: valiant effort
[3:16:44] Pradathelord: 1-1? 1-2?
[3:16:48] Jubite: the score is we're losing
[3:16:49] addyz0r: mana management is good when it is balanced. Not like rdruid that can sneak drinks and has better regen
[3:16:49] lordelenath: @dougdimaddome not sure a comp with hpriest is ever a damp comp?
[3:16:51] Pradathelord: oh 2 1 them
[3:16:51] Bombdiggity3315: looks like 2-1 now
[3:16:53] armin_ed: Its like playing double rogue in 2's, just wait for damp then kill something
[3:16:56] peacant: I think that would be a fine strategy if goes were more dangerous before dampening
[3:16:57] PastaSeat: Damn Ret / War OP better buff rogues IMO
[3:17:07] dougdimaddome: if they just play RMD they would have 3-0 this
[3:17:09] goesidd: alec flaming his replacement
[3:17:14] sixthycent: euros hate the hpals
[3:17:24] lordelenath: thats because hpal is bad
[3:17:33] mksmoke55: didnt they just win cause rdruid drank to 70%mana and hpriest was canceled after 1 sec each time?
[3:17:33] PastaSeat: I feel like Ret War without a Purge is rough
[3:17:38] Polifilla: HES DRUID MAIN NO?
[3:17:40] demololtv: what fuckin staff is that damn
[3:17:41] Polifilla: sorry caps
[3:17:48] goesidd: he won the shuffle thing on druid ye
[3:17:48] dougdimaddome: @lordelenath did you miss shadowlands?
[3:17:59] gdodmebxu: @mksmoke55 meld stealth drink needs removed
[3:18:08] Fakeswap: @demololtv legion artifact if you mean the transmog
[3:18:09] Pradathelord: @gdodmebxu how else do you win damp matches!?!?!?? Kappa
[3:18:11] chubmax: are they on a tourney realm?
[3:18:16] lordelenath: actually yes i did, only started playing 1 month ago again. but what does shadowlands have to do with this AWC?
[3:18:16] gdodmebxu: Kapp Kappa Kapp
[3:18:16] ItsBees: Ven can you add me to the mods in discord when you have a chance :3
[3:18:25] ultra_content: @dougdimaddome  boon for priest i miss only that
[3:18:29] gdodmebxu: playing against rdruid is 0 fun
[3:18:33] mksmoke55: @gdodmebxu i dont know you can see a skill difference how fast the players react to the drink
[3:18:37] ItsBees: ty rukiLove
[3:18:55] gdodmebxu: @gdodmebxu one is an rdruid and has to do way less to win
[3:18:56] ItsBees: Rdruid is op, if I can do well on it then it needs a nerf LUL
[3:19:07] Tyephoid: mistweaver not in a good spot?
[3:19:16] moltencrucible: @venruki are zeepeye and tony top 8?
[3:19:16] ALLtheEXP: I'm in the process of learning Rdruid and I'm sucking at it, but I think I'm overthinking it
[3:19:18] chubmax: the mass
[3:19:25] gdodmebxu: balance around high end 3s
[3:19:25] dougdimaddome: @lordelenath it has to do with hpriest being a healer for dampener comps lol. If they wanted to win the game early there is no reason they would play outlaw/ arcane.
[3:19:27] chizzad52: The majority isnt 1800
[3:19:29] chizzad52: its 1600
[3:19:31] ZonnyArk: i mean resto druid representation is kinda nutty
[3:19:31] modzi_xd: clone regrowth bear = gg for resto :/
[3:19:32] Lamatastisch: balance around me RAGEY
[3:19:32] chubmax: ^
[3:19:34] ryanblue98: Balance around the QQ
[3:19:35] dankgamer97: mvq is in a game
[3:19:36] EliteDamit: this is one of the main problems with league of legends balance
[3:19:36] purkey01: exactly, you definitely don’t balance around shuffle
[3:19:36] ALLtheEXP: you balance around the majority for the health of the game
[3:19:42] Bombdiggity3315: you balance around 1800 3s bracket.
[3:19:43] DeityRevert: over 2.4kish, just make damp ramp faster
[3:19:50] vmills: balance per mmr
[3:19:51] Pradathelord: start by making trinket a 2 min cd
[3:19:52] Sheepyou: Give Clone a CD and remove the cc immunity of tranq  and i would say rdruid is fine
[3:19:52] remofreecss: Maybe a increasing dumpening per rating
[3:19:55] lordelenath: honestly, just take away drinking in arena. it doesnt matter to low ratings bc nobody survives until OOM and it would fix a big advantage of rdruid.
[3:19:57] belezinha: the high end 3s is a good point to balance.
[3:19:57] gdodmebxu: @ALLtheEXP ruins tournament play
[3:19:59] xDamageincorporatedx: If you balance around solo shuffle and it means I can get a match as a dps, we take that balance :)
[3:19:59] nightmxz: I think they should strive to make the meta fun then balance around that
[3:20:00] Dopplebok: +1 for qq balance
[3:20:04] pisspuke: jamie
[3:20:08] Pradathelord: oo trimaz
[3:20:11] maybethistimepls: comms muted?
[3:20:13] Pradathelord: mr outlaw
[3:20:14] Dwilk20: Game should be balanced around 2kish and if Solo has become the primary pvp bracket should balance around it
[3:20:15] austin_545: imagine old c9 playing MLD right now in this meta.... 25 min games i stg @venruki
[3:20:21] ALLtheEXP: @gdodmebxu tournament play is such a small portion of the overall playerbase its houldn't determine the way its balanced.
[3:20:21] agent_zeiss: their matches take around 15 mins so he’ll be playing till the cows come home
[3:20:27] pisspuke: tyvm <3 <3
[3:20:28] purkey01: you can’t balance. someone’s always going to cry because they are 1600 and have to verse an rdruid but literally have no idea
[3:20:28] ultra_content: i hope they give something similar to boon at WarWithin disc heroes talents , boon of the titan or smth rukiBlankie SeemsGood
[3:20:31] ItsBees: they need to stop adding in all the stuff they added for pve purposes into pvp
[3:20:35] gdodmebxu: @gdodmebxu you should balance around playing correctly. not messing everything up
[3:20:35] ItsBees: like mobility and whatnot
[3:20:44] diperna9: anyone have a bracket
[3:20:47] purkey01: balance around the top players
[3:20:49] ultra_content: zanked has like 68 win 1 lost in 2s xo
[3:20:51] gdodmebxu: @purkey01 literally every single top rated player is complaining about rdruid
[3:20:56] pisspuke: oh noooo
[3:20:58] What_ln_Tarnation: staying hydrated EZ
[3:21:00] lordelenath: @dougdimaddome maybe it was in SL, but hpriest goes OOM pretty fast these days. really not seeing how thats a great damp comp healer pick tbh.
[3:21:13] ultra_content: most high rated % on eu like 97%
[3:21:19] jawst3k: nerf ai, procs and rng
[3:21:22] ZonnyArk: hes just sitting cc the whole game LUL
[3:21:26] kone_malone: @purkey01 rdruid is undoubtedly the most broken thing in the game atm
[3:21:29] dougdimaddome: @lordelenath which is why I said if they play rmd they win 3-0 haha
[3:21:37] gdodmebxu: @purkey01 runner up is rogue
[3:21:43] Pradathelord: the focus hunt tech is insane
[3:21:49] dougdimaddome: just because the healer isn’t the best healer for the comp doesn’t mean it is somehow not a dampener comp
[3:22:00] purkey01: check NA, Check EU and attempt to balance the top players
[3:22:05] gdodmebxu: @dougdimaddome hpriest rmp is not a dampener comp KEKW
[3:22:06] purkey01: blizz won’t do that
[3:22:13] purkey01: it’s all about pve
[3:22:18] ZonnyArk: buffs over lapping party unitframes 0/10
[3:22:22] lordelenath: @dougdimaddome maybe. but then its a bad dampener comp. which means it might as well not be one.
[3:22:27] Sheepyou: mvq is good its not fully loaded like most of the streamers have it ... u just see WeakAuras etc
[3:22:27] ALLtheEXP: the CDs on healthbars is cancer to my eyes
[3:22:29] bobbybigbuxx: I like the omnibar setup and his bars for sure
[3:22:32] purkey01: I have a feeling the comps will be very different in NA
[3:22:34] Xeliumimar: deep freeze coming to sod mage Kreygasm
[3:22:37] Jubite: gotta check what class underperformed in the raid to see who will get random pvp buffs
[3:22:40] bobbybigbuxx: yeah the nameplates are a bit much with all that going on
[3:22:45] ultra_content: lol
[3:22:55] lordelenath: do we not play immo aura selfdispell these days?
[3:23:00] dougdimaddome: @gdodmebxu you are trolling if you think outlaw arcane isn’t a dampener comp it doesn’t matter what the healer is lmao
[3:23:05] Pradathelord: i think the frames show useful info
[3:23:16] Pradathelord: DRs and prioritized purgable buffs
[3:23:17] purkey01: @dougdimaddome yep and Hpriest didn’t need to drink
[3:23:22] gdodmebxu: @dougdimaddome you can't dampen with a priest
[3:23:26] ultra_content: rmp sitting full hp
[3:23:31] What_ln_Tarnation: feel like the game has too much ability bloat, too many micro ccs and cds
[3:23:33] ImJordanHi: Thank god
[3:23:34] addyz0r: mana bar is taking dam
[3:23:39] ZonnyArk: root > root > poly > cyclone
[3:23:44] jherrera154: rogue things KEKW
[3:23:45] JNE14: Im wrecking my head with the balace but I can't define what was first the egg and the chicken
[3:23:45] dougdimaddome: @gdodmebxu I mea you can’t do it well but thats why hpriest is a bad healer for the comp lol
[3:23:49] jawst3k: rmd @ultra_content
[3:23:54] dougdimaddome: you still don’t have a win con before damp
[3:23:59] gdodmebxu: @dougdimaddome rdruid makes every comp a dampener comp Kappa
[3:24:00] Dopplebok: did you change your priest's name or is this an alt priest?
[3:24:02] amherian001: !Holzkern

[3:24:04] ultra_content: @jawst3k  true sorry
[3:24:04] armin_ed: root>clone>stun>sheep>nova>stun>clone
[3:24:06] ZonnyArk: YEP seems fine
[3:24:08] lordelenath: @What_ln_Tarnation thats certainly true. you need special mouse/keyboards these days to just have enough keybinds available for all your skills.
[3:24:11] ALLtheEXP: !Holzkern
[3:24:14] ImJordanHi: Why does NA sleep on ele so much?
[3:24:17] chubmax: yes but RMP has been king for 19 years
[3:24:19] What_ln_Tarnation: yes
[3:24:19] chubmax: RMx i guess
[3:24:21] gimmethatitem: dont let dh's hear you say that
[3:24:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah DH and rdruid are two of the top 5 strongest specs
[3:24:28] famous1939: wont someone please think of the poor dh's
[3:24:29] kone_malone: WE GOT ANY ENHANCES IN THE UPPER BRACKET!?
[3:24:33] purkey01: whatever wins people complain about it
[3:24:33] galadice: 1 RMP has won blizzcon
[3:24:35] flames222: i think that was more of a druid angle, cloning/roots on mvq
[3:24:35] purkey01: it’s insane
[3:24:36] Pradathelord: i think you're an authority on it
[3:24:37] jdot117: rmp isnt crazy in higher rating lol
[3:24:38] jawst3k: it’s not true but the forums say it is
[3:24:39] purkey01: wow community bunch of sooks
[3:24:39] Baconeggcheese: dh is op, rogues are playing a different game
[3:24:41] LichbornHQ: to answer the balance question, would be nice if for dps 1 spec balanced around shuffle and 1 around 3v3 i think
[3:24:43] Pradathelord: you're a blizzcon champion
[3:24:43] galadice: 1 time
[3:24:45] jdot117: ppl just dont know how to play against it so they rage lol
[3:24:49] Eckosaurus: didnt TSG win blizzcon in wrath?
[3:24:50] ZonnyArk: maybe not rogue mage, but rogues have always been annoying LUL
[3:24:51] What_ln_Tarnation: even if they dont win, theyre ALWAYS there
[3:24:52] armin_ed: Shadow play is cancer
[3:24:52] Vramii: it’s always viable but not the best
[3:24:53] Malgaroth: Because mage doesn't have enouggh dam ?
[3:24:55] lordelenath: youre certainly more of an authority on it that twitch chat @venruki
[3:24:57] pkire: you're definitely an athority
[3:24:58] iTzCompadre: When is NA AWC...
[3:24:59] knadam13: rogue mage has been pissing the most people off for 19 years
[3:25:01] xoHOLLOW: i think historically wizard comps have always done well in tourney
[3:25:02] chubmax: ^
[3:25:02] hypefull: NAHJ AND DOPAMINE
[3:25:02] ultra_content: in the last 3 exp tho
[3:25:03] hunterschneider12: Are there any strong warlock comps rn?
[3:25:04] Deacon_III: Cdew won, boomy dh
[3:25:07] Pradathelord: what about shaman druid
[3:25:08] Jubite: id take RMP games over damp games any day of the week
[3:25:09] purkey01: if you play a comp that doesn’t do well against another comp then you complain
[3:25:10] shawdowfax77: RMP only wins about 70% of the time bro get real
[3:25:14] PastaSeat: I think there is RMP fatigue after being so dominant in Shadowlands
[3:25:21] jdot117: @Jubite same
[3:25:21] JohnneMANN: for 15 years ive been wondering what TSG stands for
[3:25:31] jherrera154: Ven I think if the move is really really Tight RPS is gonna fucking wreck the bracket.
[3:25:32] galdinator: took rogues like 12 years to win a blizzcon
[3:25:33] shawdowfax77: dont do it
[3:25:34] ultra_content: i think in all BFA/SL/DF every final was won by a rog or smth
[3:25:35] What_ln_Tarnation: RMX just makes the game unfun for everyone else, even if i beat a RMX team, im not happy at the end
[3:25:38] pisspuke: LSD yeah
[3:25:38] Pradathelord: big true
[3:25:39] goesidd: @JohnneMANN the super gosus or w/e their team name was

[3:25:48] JNE14: @venruki yesterdaay that dh that played against you in Solo something bout ahd
[3:25:48] JokeHoleToilet: how dare you
[3:25:49] purkey01: if I play a class and I come across another class that counters me. then my opinion will be they are broken LOL
[3:25:50] ancilx: what about after they added the DR trackers
[3:25:50] twinbladeuk: and ret pala :)
[3:25:51] Pradathelord: LSD
[3:25:52] gdodmebxu: and warlocks
[3:25:52] Jubite: triggered
[3:25:53] gjvl: Sounds like you're saying rogues need a heal spec
[3:25:56] lordelenath: Ill take RMP meta over damp/rdruid meta anyday. And I'm saying that as a war main.
[3:25:57] Baconeggcheese: 70% of the time they win every time
[3:25:59] zuorias: hasn't rogue mage basically been a really good comp since arenas became a thing?
[3:25:59] Cdenzy: Kappa
[3:26:02] galadice: lock/shaman/war has the highest representation in blizzcon over the last 19 yrs
[3:26:06] EliasIsHere: Is this awc game?
[3:26:07] jdot117: ppl are so blind to things just because rmp is frustrating to play against
[3:26:08] Yaycarrots: FeelsWeirdMan
[3:26:09] tormyboo: ya ele was so relevant in tbc LUL
[3:26:12] armin_ed: nerf shamans agreed
[3:26:12] vmewo: Lock is the golden child
[3:26:13] What_ln_Tarnation: RMX is cancer to fight against, always
[3:26:15] sixthycent: shamans and locks more than rmp
[3:26:15] teribad: LSD
[3:26:15] Pradathelord: just because its a good comp doesnt mean that lock shaman and lock druid are insane
[3:26:17] Vramii: hunters never good and it makes me sad
[3:26:18] vmewo: Secret favorite
[3:26:19] JohnneMANN: @goesidd wasnt it The Gosus Crew?
[3:26:20] Pradathelord: and highly represented
[3:26:21] Malgaroth: @gdodmebxu It was garbage in sl and bfa bro,  2 last expansions
[3:26:21] tastyjustt: I mean if you all triple cross in voice rmp is brain dead
[3:26:28] Pradathelord: @JohnneMANN super gosus i think
[3:26:32] gdodmebxu: @gdodmebxu it was not KEKW
[3:26:39] vmewo: war crushes outlaw

[3:34:03] lordelenath: @bonaphil hes not confirmed. and there's 3/4 top teams right now playing ele. Its not just jaime
[3:34:25] bonaphil: @lordelenath right the 15 videos that have come out about him aren't damning. Stop defending a cheater.
[3:34:29] Extramediums: DH reminds me of a trick that was used back in the Super Nintendo days, some one put a Popsicle stick across the A and B buttons, held in place with a rubber band for a olympics game and just mashed on the stick because the game would detect controllers that you could set up so holding the buttons spams it perfectly. So to bypass it they needed ever so slightly random intervals for inputs. That's what DH's should do
[3:34:30] armin_ed: Mvq doing something really good that I dont think others have been doing is killing all them trents from druids.
[3:34:49] What_ln_Tarnation: 47
[3:34:50] Noremorse77: @bonaphil There's less than 5% chance that he's legit.
[3:34:52] lordelenath: @bonaphil i dont care about jaime. doesnt change the fact that the only spriest competing is wizk, all other casters are mage/lock/ele

[3:39:32] lordelenath: I mean I wish wow pvp was alive. but it doesnt feel that way.
[3:39:38] Baconeggcheese: I always hate when people post a SS of a mildly populated area to try and make those kinds of arguments. Same thing when people would take a screenshot of orgrimmar in classic and be like "era is poppin!"
[3:39:44] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Passelat WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool

[3:39:56] chaps_86: @Omnadren the qualifiers arent streamed/casted
[3:39:59] iTzCompadre: Ven who you think wins the first AWC Cup ?
[3:40:00] JNE14: Im out take care everyone
[3:40:02] JohnneMANN: DH reminds me of a trick that was used back in the Super Nintendo days, some one put a Popsicle stick across the A and B buttons, held in place with a rubber band for a olympics game and just mashed on the stick because the game would detect controllers that you could set up so holding the buttons spams it perfectly. So to bypass it they needed ever so slightly random intervals for inputs. That's what DH's should do
[3:40:16] Jhawkfan1: Did you ever compete in the awc
[3:40:16] Omnadren: @chaps_86 thanks
[3:40:26] Pingabreath: Feels fine to me.. But they should make it easier to get into pvp

[3:40:38] flames222: wow pvp feels fine, i get fast ques up to 2100/2200, what more do you want? lol

[3:41:43] palawakeup: how?
[3:41:45] DJ_HappyDays: HAVE YOU SEEN ELE SHAMAN ROTATION?
[3:41:47] Pradathelord: some people somehow don't annihilation enough
[3:41:49] palawakeup: dh skill is based on pre goes and shit
[3:41:49] eainzsp: cdew playing his arcane rn
[3:41:49] comfyslayer: everyone thinks that until they play it
[3:41:49] michaelss_: every class rotation is easy, playing good is what’s hard
[3:41:49] mvpala_tv: ele is easier, or dev
[3:41:50] monkestronke: bm and ele are easiest
[3:41:51] PLUGGlNG: WW monk easy rotation
[3:41:51] Cephqt: @venruki can i get a quick take on ele/spriest/healer?  I want know if its viable to push rating in ladder play
[3:41:51] palawakeup: but its rotation
[3:41:53] InkdAdam: dev evoker is easy
[3:41:53] palawakeup: is so simple

[3:41:56] Swingingwilly: evoker
[3:41:57] bambo_____: everything is easier then DH
[3:41:58] jawst3k: I think dev evoker, bm hunter
[3:41:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Chanimal rocked today, I was able to see him play
[3:41:59] Pradathelord: devoker for sure lmao

[3:42:10] CrazyJoeDavola57: demon hunter has a smooth rotation
[3:42:10] Unarmd: destro for sure
[3:42:12] ALLtheEXP: yeah, nah. Ven is right, it's not an "EZ" rotation, it just does a lot of damage
[3:42:19] spellgunx: exept fire mage does half ele and dh damage

[3:42:51] Jubite: can you turn on their comms?
[3:42:54] Extramediums: DH has the advantage of essentially rarely having to think about playing defensive. Rotations are all simple in wow.
[3:42:56] Pradathelord: struggle to live and manage 1 school even with precog
[3:42:57] krisdahaka: please don't discuss "rotations" in PvP context
[3:42:59] hataroxz: not good arcane cant even do dmg

[3:54:44] simstarx: there's no moonkins in top eu teams rn
[3:54:54] SteLawBro: High level players worried about dampening. Low level healers not queuing because things die too fast. 🤔
[3:54:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't seen a boomkin yet, but I think some will be in NA games
[3:54:58] jabbahutt89: no boomies in EU /:

[3:56:24] bobbybigbuxx: tbf if you nully shroud and start seeing the balls disappear you are supposed to tail swipe and get the rogue out of stealth
[3:56:26] rockxtv: @vmewo I was thinking just up it's energy cost so you can't triple cheap the entire team
[3:56:34] Kosok42: I keep tuning in and seeing ferals.... is there something I'm missing? I thought they were super squish
[3:56:37] JWCM: any1 got bracket

[3:57:55] Dyressa: insane rescue

[6:41:43] Badasti: @DiscoSlim I personally think Wizards benefit more from having space and time, melee relies on snowballing (in my opinion)
[6:41:55] clicket: far cry from the c9 days
[6:41:57] AsdOfc: mld into some stuff, echo on eu has been messing around w it for sure
[6:41:58] stonedmonkey: mage lock  B+ tier  maybe
[6:42:09] jacob_the_mage: @DiscSlim you win against that by having extreme pressure and if you pull back, then you have none
[6:42:37] yesterday_potato: dh and elle both no showing much on this side of the pond actually
[6:42:44] armin_ed: Outlaw rng pumps
[6:42:46] AsdOfc: i think thats a different issue from mld being a decent wizard comp though

[6:43:11] Bmojo: @venruki can you try to explain why that might be? the dh ele thing
[6:43:17] ChaosEmperor24: How many mages in eu
[6:43:21] face2face: I dont think echo will play dh ele most of the time
[6:43:22] Nextrkw: i dont think its 5
[6:43:24] Badasti: i would have thought dh boomie was a better comp
[6:43:25] kand1nsky: cdew gonna bring it
[6:43:25] Nextrkw: fuseton is not playing dh ele
[6:43:25] face2face: I think they'll do arcane outlaw

[6:43:38] Nextrkw: its 3 and jaime didnt qual
[6:43:41] armin_ed: Think NA will see the boomkin or spriest more then the ele.
[6:43:45] hozaror: ele is too squishy it just dies.
[6:43:52] skez_live: we have more r shams though
[6:44:02] stonedmonkey: all the NA ele Script and kick bott not really tourny viable
[6:44:05] skez_live: and you def won’t double sham
[6:44:18] ChaosEmperor24: @venruki whats the mage representation like?
[6:44:20] StreetBlades: Oh, ok. It's not just me then. It felt so clunky to play it against some classes
[6:44:25] ImJordanHi: WW does a lot of damage, so its like..how do you "buff it"...I feel like it needs a re work
[6:44:27] wackpoetic: WW into melee cleaves is awesome, super good, very fun. WW into caster comps is the least fun spec I've played
[6:44:31] Ceribi: @hozaror and on eu they are an immortal class

[6:47:18] PuffnTuff: and changing the game based around the top .1% is a bad way to balance

[6:47:27] StreetBlades: Yea, I agree @wackpoetic  . Had a lobby with 3 casters. Not fun at all :D

[6:52:08] veltrinor: the rogue nerf we all been waiting for
[6:52:08] Stealthgam3r: probably a good idea
[6:52:11] stonedmonkey: Draft pick like LOL so more classes get played
[6:52:11] Chappypappy1: bans are so good for games with hardcore metas
[6:52:11] Nerfmetodeath: certain people would just never get to play for their team then
[6:52:13] EFFSIN: good shaman mog
[6:52:15] DeityRevert: sounds good but would be so far from actual meta. maybe it's a good thing idk
[6:52:16] Craives: never gona see rogue again

[6:52:18] Unarmd: ban 1 healer and 1 dps
[6:52:19] wallflower819: I rem a tournament where band were allowed. Some org's tourny. It was my favorite tournament to watch
[6:52:20] PuffnTuff: lots of games do bans
[6:52:21] nargonisttv: Why is it that you don't participate in AWC? Are you unable to because you commentate?
[6:52:23] clicket: I think it'd be fun to watch but some people would just get effectively banned from tournament play

[6:52:24] HazardLaw94: perma ban boomy into liquid then and you just delete their best comp
[6:52:25] Nateypww: agreed
[6:52:32] Kikrino: Imagaine both teams got 3 bans each. 1 healer 1 range and 1 melee
[6:52:33] Paybacks: they need to at least try it at this point
[6:52:34] Cvarks: apparently arcane sucks in tourney KEKW
[6:52:36] memil141: ty 4 reddinfg my bad eng love u 4 that
[6:52:36] thyroidxd: yeah resto druid easiest ban
[6:52:40] Xanthem4: Or after a spec is played in a game, cant play the same spec for the rest of the series
[6:52:45] thebusteds: that would actually make it super interesting
[6:52:51] clicket: Imagine going against bicmex and banning survival
[6:52:53] Cvarks: yeah just not played rather
[6:52:55] rekt1370: destro best caster for sure
[6:53:10] FlexterMorgan: what if they only had 1 healing spec? lol

[6:53:23] ChaosEmperor24: And then raiku comes in and says... what did you say?!
[6:53:24] Badasti: mage durability heavily impacted by purge maybe? Lock seems a bit more consistent
[6:53:30] rekt1370: @flyingorangee  yea he died and they put chan in on destro and won LUL

[8:00:04] McLarge: @OverlordMoonOfficial I didn't see that game. What did they play against, and did they win?
[8:00:05] DaraxBarex: frost dk op?!?! kekw

[8:01:25] Mattiu: what a scum
[8:01:38] BrokenEarBank: lol not waiting is funny af
[8:01:50] modzi_xd: yea that sucks shoulda waited since he dc'd
[8:02:03] DaraxBarex: blizz cant even keep their servers together lmao
[8:02:03] Chaskw: not waiting is a bit low
[8:02:03] ImJordanHi: @BrokenEarBank How is it funny?
[8:02:05] BrokenEarBank: did they wait for his dc?
[8:02:08] McLarge: @Bmojo When looking at the ladder, there are more factors to take in. For example, there are (or at least were) a ton of DH/DKs queueing on NA, and that comp is a bit of a hard counter for Shamans in general
[8:02:16] Stoichulk: He just used distract on the treants....mind blown
[8:02:21] BrokenEarBank: because it is
[8:02:32] Alerothan: Lmao outlaw/destro's health not even moving
[8:02:37] ImJordanHi: @BrokenEarBank "because it is" highly intelligent response
[8:03:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think he just sapped a treant, too
[8:03:08] Moobot: Latest video "The Casual PvP Community Is Begging For Help" view it here: youtu.be/ztKSy4IjNfo
[8:03:14] Bmojo: @McLarge true yeah. you're not wrong. i just am convinced there's something more random at play. the meta has always been different in similar ways US vs. EU
[8:03:15] ImJordanHi: @BrokenEarBank People have waited years for this moment, literal years, and its "funny" a team doesnt wait when you DC randomly, unintentionally...hilarious......
[8:04:07] pharmztko: @brokenearbank how dare you laugh
[8:04:20] BrokenEarBank: correct it is hilarious because they just waited for him and he didn’t so it’s funny on his behalf. what’s actually funny is you crying in a chat over a video game for someone else lol
[8:04:21] healhut: we must all be outraged!
[8:04:22] McLarge: @Bmojo There certainly could be something else, but I would be inclined to agree with Ven in this instance
[8:04:24] omniboy12: @ImJordanHi people are allowed to think something is funny when others do not
[8:04:25] BrokenEarBank: @imjordanhi
[8:04:31] arxyamvs: @ImJordanHi cant say in the moment, or ever. if someone dcs by hitting a cord or intentionally.
[8:04:37] BrokenEarBank: @omniboy12 right lol kids weird
[8:04:53] DaraxBarex: omg they actually lose?!
[8:04:54] sillysheepweepandsleep: lol
[8:04:56] Nephhx: wtf
[8:04:57] BrokenEarBank: still lost lol
[8:04:59] shoal3: underestimating fdk

[8:05:10] Butterstirn69: ooooh nahj, will you ever learn ?
[8:05:15] modzi_xd: nd still lost
[8:05:18] ImJordanHi: @BrokenEarBank I'm not crying about it...I think its a weird thing to think is "funny" I can just tell you've never reached a pinnacle
[8:05:18] crawnpocktail: the cheese comp is insane if done right
[8:05:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: The burst things those specs can do are crazy
[8:05:28] sillysheepweepandsleep: lose to dc?
[8:05:28] DaraxBarex: craazy burst
[8:05:40] SuperSunBros64: devo pumps too
[8:05:42] ImJordanHi: @BrokenEarBank I'm not playing lol, I don't care. It just shows you've never accomplished anything
[8:05:56] healhut: its called irony. irony is funny.
[8:06:05] Diviniumz: frost dk won
[8:06:08] smoothytoothy: dev won
[8:06:11] healhut: dev/dk with the W
[8:06:12] sillysheepweepandsleep: these guy lost to dc
[8:06:13] BrokenEarBank: @imjordanhi lol it is funny and I don’t have to explain my accomplishments to you 😂 I know my value unlike yourself
[8:06:14] zerx_gg: Relax, children
[8:06:15] BigZachh: @venruki do you know the dismiss treant macro for r druids?
[8:06:15] DaraxBarex: frost dk team just globaled warlock lol
[8:06:22] BrokenEarBank: yeah they did, was wild
[8:06:24] danielrx25: they 1 shot the warlock
[8:06:29] ImJordanHi: @BrokenEarBank I'm sure you do ;)
[8:06:32] tarth_100: you can dismiss treants?
[8:06:34] hey_staks: frost dk team one after being dc'd for two stun drs
[8:06:36] Vipur45: yeah
[8:06:37] DaraxBarex: craazy comp
[8:06:38] SuperSunBros64: was trants team they kinda good
[8:06:39] Vipur45: totem dismiss
[8:06:43] hamberderss: just right click em
[8:06:47] Vipur45: macro it
[8:06:47] rogdox: why tho
[8:06:50] tarth_100: thats so dumb, they should keep you in combat forever to stop the drink metta!
[8:06:52] Vipur45: stealth
[8:06:55] crawnpocktail: usually cancelaura
[8:07:01] McLarge: I think Treants are just a buff up at the top right, so you can probably just cancelaura them if I had to guess
[8:07:04] tooch2: Can you please explain whats going on with the bracket, the website is actually impossible to use...
[8:07:05] crawnpocktail: i'd guess its same for treants
[8:07:06] DaraxBarex: just leave arena and drink ez pepega
[8:07:07] Vipur45: not cancelaura
[8:07:21] rawzool: nahj and them better be careful I feel like they are playing half speed against this comp and it can cheese
[8:07:24] Vipur45: can i link the macro @venruki
[8:07:32] Transparentmirror: Nah, they count as guardians. So it's like dismissing a totem @crawnpocktail
[8:07:38] Sosatko: @Vipur45 Can you PM it to me ive been LF one that works
[8:07:43] crawnpocktail: @Transparentmirror ahh okok, makes sense
[8:08:07] BrokenEarBank: to funny lol
[8:08:08] McLarge: This Frost DK is dual wielding. Interesting
[8:08:27] Stoichulk: Lining his healer with that breath
[8:08:46] tarth_100: @Vipur45  can you dm me that macro please :D
[8:08:58] AsdOfc: should a frost dk win anything idk
[8:08:59] Tuckbudford: I'd  hate to face nahj outlaw in a tournie thats gonna be hard

[8:09:19] crawnpocktail: 100% about getting that good setup
[8:09:19] ButtaTWD: fdk evoker is good rn
[8:09:25] crawnpocktail: its insane if done right
[8:09:26] Transparentmirror: Like totemic recall back in the days to dismiss totems, they should add "Burn them" for druid treants when they wanna dismiss them pepeLaugh
[8:09:46] nightmxz: I beat this team playing my prevoker in the first round LMAO
[8:10:11] nightmxz: nah we got owned by toonah kubzy then lost in losers
[8:10:24] nightmxz: I subbed out thouggh so I have 100% win this tourney :)
[8:10:24] dabufy_true: Rogue is very good
[8:10:31] dabufy_true: I like the reactions
[8:10:31] McLarge: Dude, the range on that Kidney btw
[8:10:41] ImJordanHi: @BrokenEarBank Enable whispers =)
[8:10:42] DaraxBarex: is this the last game of the day?
[8:10:48] Arcanocrystal: Should remove gouge
[8:11:16] Vipur45: /run if not UnitAffectingCombat("player")then for i=1,4 do n="t"..i CreateFrame("Button",n,UIParent,"SecureUnitButtonTemplate")_G[n]:SetAttribute("type","destroytotem")_G[n]:SetAttribute("totem-slot",i)end end /click t1 /click t2 /click t3 /click t4
[8:11:25] laner_219: hey can you explain why we don’t see ele rouge? or is it just because not many shaman mains again
[8:11:44] Arcanocrystal: But how trant when no druid 🤔
[8:11:53] chrisiirc: omg
[8:12:10] zerx_gg: oooh i memba
[8:12:11] Neurotoxal: when are they going to remove outlaw from the game
[8:12:14] unsccessful: @Vipur45 whats this
[8:12:15] McLarge: @Arcanocrystal Honestly, Sub and Outlaw just need to be viable kill targets. The problem is that they can only die to other Rogues when playing correctly
[8:12:15] Nightbot: https://raider.io/events/awc-dragonflight-season-3-cup-1-north-america/brackets/open-bracket
[8:12:25] ishbuux: only sub should get shadow dance only assa should get cheat death and cloak evasion
[8:12:26] Vipur45: treant dismiss macro
[8:12:45] Tuckbudford: I wish rogues had CPs on the target again so they cant just kid healer every 5 seconds
[8:12:46] dabinski: did crusader make it past the first 3 games?
[8:12:47] twinkieruler95: what place did chuck get
[8:13:02] dabinski: XD
[8:13:02] DaraxBarex: was there an official stream for the AWC?
[8:13:15] revzzz1: LUL LUL
[8:13:16] thorgasm69420: refs probably cheated against the maestro
[8:13:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP Big Judge
[8:13:25] druccibaby: any teams running ww?
[8:13:25] Reiumi_: pepoG
[8:13:29] Dyssyx: venruki, is 1900 high in 2s atm?
[8:13:31] nightmxz: This is the official stream for the open bracket tourney
[8:13:33] twinkieruler95: are you casting
[8:13:37] DaraxBarex: ooh cool thanks
[8:13:46] sillysheepweepandsleep: why you not playing ven
[8:13:58] nightmxz: Make sure you subscribe or use your twitch prime to support the official stream twitch.tv/venruki everyone
[8:14:05] GLYFEnation: I thought Naj was EU?
[8:14:10] Nadasky: Why is AWC so late in the season? Doesn't it make more sense to do it earlier when more people are playing WoW?
[8:14:20] zerx_gg: There's an age limit for players to participate
[8:14:21] Badasti: @sillysheepweepandsleep Ven wants to give other people a chance to win
[8:14:23] tablez: why dont you cast while playing :d
[8:14:24] DaraxBarex: i mean they waited for him
[8:14:26] zerx_gg: no old men Sadge
[8:14:34] wtfidkx: good ole static totem dc
[8:14:44] eyah: idk kalvish's team just had a drink
[8:14:48] nargonisttv: Have there been any wild upsets so far
[8:14:48] wow_revan: @venruki Ven, they was winning before CD, the rogue was practically death
[8:15:09] dabinski: nah wiz snuck in the game and hit him with the mind control d/c bug
[8:15:13] Axtin: what are the actual rules about dc's that are blizzards fault
[8:15:28] DaraxBarex: are all the players this AWC veterans or are there up and coming young players you know ven?
[8:15:34] trikkSP: @GLYFEnation he is from arizona lol
[8:15:37] Axtin: even if its something like mc bug?
[8:15:45] druccibaby: makes sense, people would abuse fake dcs
[8:15:51] dabinski: meep is like 14 @DaraxBarex
[8:16:04] Alerothan: People could fake DC's otherwise
[8:16:05] wow_revan: Interne is sux in US anyway. Its not like Eu..
[8:16:05] DaraxBarex: @dabinski oooh nice what class?
[8:16:07] just_varick: spam mc = clean sweep tourny?
[8:16:21] dabinski: mw monk
[8:16:22] million88: is this meeps team?
[8:16:37] dabinski: no @million88
[8:16:40] Axtin: ya it sucks but theres no perfect solution
[8:16:44] DaraxBarex: other esports have timeouts and pauses for DC's
[8:16:46] ButtaTWD: do you think you should kill on dc or wait
[8:16:47] Axtin: the only solution is blizz fix their game
[8:16:48] Badasti: hey there's no fairness in warfare
[8:16:48] rawzool: ppl could just say they dc when losing too
[8:16:54] Ziqoftw: there is a perfect solution
[8:17:00] eyah: why is there no pause on tr
[8:17:00] Ziqoftw: add a /pause command
[8:17:02] ishbuux: the solution is make major tournaments LAN like they used to be
[8:17:07] storm_chaser_ron: we know there are competitors that will cheat so you cant leave them additional options
[8:17:12] zerx_gg: ziqo been watchin league
[8:17:15] nightmxz: I remember that in SC2 that was great
[8:17:16] Nephhx: ^
[8:17:17] DaraxBarex: almost every esport has pause for dc
[8:17:18] Badasti: I learnt from a friend way back in the day during starcraft matches, there's no such thing as mercy >:)
[8:17:21] DaraxBarex: blizz is just suck in 2004 lol
[8:17:21] twinkieruler95: just dont DC
[8:17:23] twinkieruler95: git gud
[8:17:23] gaulois62: pause command is like basic in all esport game lol
[8:17:31] Ezflex11: I feel like a pause command is bad. Its a total red light to momentum
[8:17:32] Frostyworgz: we obviously know the admins dont want to step on toes or cdew wouldnt have been able to openly abuse innervate bug in starting room to win blizzcon
[8:17:42] Nickystr1x: even with a pause comand, a lot of the games is building up psychological momentum by reacting in the moment, so that can still shift the tempo of the game when they come back
[8:17:44] SuperSunBros64: DC automatic pauses game
[8:17:48] infernion: Is no one playing DH on NA or?
[8:17:50] healhut: @Ezflex11 so is dc'ing in the first place
[8:18:01] brewtank: brewtank subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! ive had 1400 cal the last 3 days in a row to try to hit a goal. worst thing ever LOL. never again
[8:18:01] DaraxBarex: lets be real though, blizz wont do anything. they dont care about pvp kekw
[8:18:02] infernion: I swear DH destro is the best comp in the game?
[8:18:02] nezz231: dc happens in alot of games.. pro cs got player dc and they dont restart either
[8:18:02] Tuckbudford: oh saved by the druid
[8:18:07] nightmxz: I think dh ele and dh outlaw are the only things that can stop arcane rmd
[8:18:08] infernion: Ye rogues or dh destro
[8:18:11] trikkSP: whazz masterclasss
[8:18:15] Alerothan: Even pause isnt perfect because it still messes with the tempo of the game and also gives people time to think about whats going  on that they wouldnt have had
[8:18:16] nightmxz: maybe ele outlaw too
[8:18:19] TheMysticBean: does NA have any good DH / Ele players?
[8:18:23] kreyzy8: @infernion I didn't see 1 team play DH/destro on EU today though
[8:18:27] brewtank: @infernion whaazz team gonna play destro lock and win prob
[8:18:31] infernion: @nightmxz Impossible, rogue or dh destro can't lose
[8:18:32] indrah___: how did pikaboo team? did he win?
[8:18:36] kreyzy8: it was all ele DH
[8:18:38] McLarge: @infernion If you ask most DHs, they would say that DH/Ele is better
[8:18:42] eygton: you think lock, rogue, Druid is the best line up?
[8:18:43] tablez: dh can die while outlaw is very very very hard to kill with similar dam atm
[8:18:54] infernion: Dh destro is completely godtier
[8:18:56] Axtin: so how would pause work, the players can type  /pause? or the game pauses when a player is offline
[8:18:58] Kramoune: @venruki real question... do you think arena should be like awc ? like every game is a best of 5 with a map selection like other Esport (LoL, Dota 2, Csgo 2, RB6 siege etc etc) like same format for  tourny and reg ranked
[8:18:59] nightmxz: @infernion Idk man Kubzy just lines the destro the entire game
[8:19:13] infernion: You do 70k dps without casting on destro tho
[8:19:21] nightmxz: @Axtin Game would auto pause on DC for 1min and then unpause
[8:19:22] DaraxBarex: @Axtin make it like almost every other esport in existence. have a hotkey bounded for pause lol
[8:19:32] McLarge: @infernion Ele doesn't cast either and does more
[8:19:34] FinkleTheMage: I'm not, with all those stam buffs
[8:19:40] mong00sebite: has there been any hunters?
[8:19:41] RedeemedbyJesus: Oh shoot. Just got back home and Ven is still going
[8:19:46] Axtin: @DaraxBarex i dont play other games so idk how its implemented in other games
[8:19:46] Kramoune: because every esport is the same format as tourny for regular ranked
[8:19:50] FinkleTheMage: Wiz makes Sp look SO easy, when it's legit not at all haha
[8:19:51] infernion: Wouldn't sp just auto lose to melee cleaves or hunter teams?
[8:19:52] SteLawBro: Last thingme wife needs to read is that WoW has a pause feature 🙄
[8:19:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sam on boomkin is lit
[8:19:54] FinkleTheMage: His team enables him so well too
[8:19:58] mineosx: did the frogs play rmd?
[8:20:01] wackpoetic: Destro seems OP because Fear is OP
[8:20:04] brewtank: @Axtin remember in wotlk when that monkey trinket dropped in that hall dungeon
[8:20:10] DaraxBarex: @Axtin yeah almost every esport has pause bounded to like F9 or F10 and team can just pause and wait with time limits
[8:20:13] infernion: I guess true
[8:20:14] kreyzy8: @infernion the move beats most DH/DK and DH/ret on ladder
[8:20:15] wallflower819: I'd be okay maybe as a game mode. But best out of 3
[8:20:28] Nephhx: let’s gooooo
[8:20:29] Kramoune: oom
[8:20:29] Axtin: @brewtank i do
[8:20:29] flippinbaconx: melee cleaves are kinda boring to watch tbh
[8:20:30] symbolism369: pog dev
[8:20:33] nightmxz: What's the set of the score?
[8:20:34] whittyxo: bro how do you lose to fdk
[8:20:35] wtfidkx: NONE CAN STAND AGAINST THE MIGHT OF TRANT
[8:20:37] brewtank: @Axtin i was that rdru im sorry lol
[8:20:42] americanmoses18: dude xeek legit made this comp work now we see another one lol
[8:20:43] storm_chaser_ron: frost DK OP?
[8:20:46] Raskopp: I feel like its been a while since we last saw a warrior
[8:20:47] Axtin: @brewtank lmao wow
[8:20:52] ImJordanHi: He said "we just need to kill before we go OOM" no shot that's the strat
[8:20:52] sillysheepweepandsleep: 2 1
[8:20:53] brewtank: lmao
[8:20:53] infernion: I have no idea how strong destro/outlaw is, I never played it before today, but looks insane indeed
[8:20:55] monkestronke: frost dk better than outlaw confirmed
[8:20:57] Xeronate: frost dk devoker hidden tech
[8:21:07] Badasti: frost dev cheese
[8:21:08] DaraxBarex: No wonder why blizz never touched frost dk cause its op! kekw
[8:21:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: No blood DKs, but there is a frost DK surprise LUL
[8:21:13] nightmxz: Renner needs to play prevoker, I destroyed these guys on it LOL
[8:21:16] Xeronate: thought everyone said this comp was shit because too predictable right?
[8:21:18] sillysheepweepandsleep: dh outlaw for the win
[8:21:21] Aramith9: Yall fgorget liquid played this all of ssn 1?
[8:21:23] symbolism369: @brewtank xD
[8:21:24] ariacy: Is this Xeeks team or this a different team?
[8:21:31] waggz: surprise surprise no ferals
[8:21:32] Eckosaurus: @ariacy diff team
[8:21:34] Axtin: frost dk comps should be banned
[8:21:36] McLarge: Wasn't Liquid experimenting with FDK as a counter to Outlaw back in Shadowlands Season 3? I feel like I remember them trying it on ladder and having a positive impression
[8:21:36] nikthevoker: outlaw is more cheest
[8:21:37] kingcamps_alot: that comp has no ms effect right?
[8:21:39] nikthevoker: then any Fdk
[8:21:41] palawakeup: is the gw2 team still in?
[8:21:43] GoldenKnightStd: @ariacy diferent team, xeek already on top
[8:21:43] DaraxBarex: no hunters kekw
[8:21:51] ariacy: Thank you
[8:21:51] nightmxz: @Axtin nah let's all play frost DKs so they get nerfed
[8:21:53] DaraxBarex: hunters need buff kekw
[8:21:55] Xeronate: is there good mage representation?
[8:21:57] tablez: we have all our feral dreams in one man
[8:22:01] mong00sebite: is that EU jungle the only top 8 hunter who made it?
[8:22:02] SuperSunBros64: xeek is Draco cleave I think

[8:23:02] Badasti: hey as a Mage man I'm happy to see him back on the master class LUL
[8:23:02] nightmxz: All the bad arcane mages are convincing everyone it's bad when really they're playing bad
[8:23:03] unsccessful: kubzy was R Druid main right?
[8:23:07] stillthechamp: kubzy is just different
[8:23:12] McLarge: Maybe Mage just isn't scaling with the gear as well as everything else?
[8:23:13] TheMysticBean: @Axtin gigaferal, fairs
[8:23:15] tiltedteepee: other classes get BiS gear and close gap?
[8:23:16] GLYFEnation: Is Chanimal playing EU or NA?
[8:23:17] stillthechamp: this guy is so fucking amazing on arcane its not even funny anymore
[8:23:24] waggz: i thought cassidy was playign evoker feral?
[8:23:25] KaptinKazual: @venruki all the mages expected to be able to run the execute staff, but it is nerfed like 70% on TR
[8:23:29] pugnatwoo: Chan plays on EU with Echo
[8:23:34] Axtin: @waggz they played both
[8:23:36] Bernablaw: mb lag, they are complaining about high ms
[8:23:37] GoldenKnightStd: i heard that before resto druid, kubzy was actually a mage main
[8:23:42] Buglifeee: @pugnatwoo nope
[8:23:45] zachgamegodx: nahj intensity level so low
[8:23:46] GoldenKnightStd: not sure if that s true

[8:23:58] crookedmanx: who’s winning the tournament??
[8:24:05] Alerothan: @venruki Do you think Outlaw will be seeing nerfs after AWC ends?
[8:24:08] hadesthedkgoddd: where is venruki??
[8:24:16] Dyssyx: @zachgamegodx Nahj is just the quiet achiever
[8:24:17] hamsti: and it goes through walls
[8:24:19] infernion: Hey hey hey hey hey now Ven.....
[8:24:22] revzzz1: LUL LUL
[8:24:22] hamsti: walls are the dumb part
[8:24:23] thebarnabyangel: they're rifts bro
[8:24:24] tostitoscoop: ven, sorry if been asked, but why do you do any tournies?
[8:24:24] nightmxz: Arcane should have spawned all the portals
[8:24:26] DaraxBarex: Blizz been invlove with warlocks since classic lol
[8:24:26] pugnatwoo: I could be wrong, they did last season but I feel with how good destro is that it makes sense he is the 4th for sure?
[8:24:26] Axtin: @waggz its just situational, jungle does better into warlocks
[8:24:27] dvoraklol: its a rift
[8:24:29] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy beastnephew3 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[8:24:30] Xeronate: maybe but it a portal from hell i think idkk
[8:24:33] Badasti: that and we are the only class with no stun, bring back deep freeze
[8:24:35] SaltyBites: make soldiers come out of portals
[8:24:36] infernion: I love how immolate is 25% of our damage and hits harder than UA KEKW
[8:24:36] Tuckbudford: warlocks should summon demons with their rift
[8:24:37] dvoraklol: hahaha yeah
[8:24:42] dvoraklol: dark portal
[8:24:42] figurines: Appreciate your recent youtube video. Not really accurate feedback for casual, but I"
[8:24:42] Xeronate: ones demonic dog
[8:24:44] weevinx: what’s a goon to a goblin
[8:24:45] thebarnabyangel: one's torn one's made breh
[8:24:45] nightmxz: Open a portal from the hall of the guardians order hall and release a stream of magic power
[8:24:46] CaranoBlaze: Warlocks summon portals to hell. Mages don't.
[8:24:46] figurines: enjoyed watching it
[8:24:47] kaza_bialaruska: you win, you're the champion!
[8:24:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's a rift, totally different LUL
[8:24:51] scabuu: the orignal black portal is made by a warlock
[8:24:51] Multiplemitch: mages portal but locks summon
[8:24:55] BingoTingler: portal goes both ways; rifts only deliver (demons)
[8:24:56] stealthwalker99: The double pet cs lock is more bs, 12 sec lockout
[8:24:56] pvalue01: rift is to a different world, portal is within azeroth? idk
[8:24:58] McLarge: A rift is closer to a tear and a portal is just a doorway, obviously Kappa
[8:24:59] Shxcky: rift is a fissure xD
[8:25:02] skwiglz: the should give mages portals that summon golems
[8:25:07] hunchurio: what's the score of this game?
[8:25:08] Ziqoftw: this video sounds amazing where can i watch it?
[8:25:09] Axtin: people made fun of me for kicking immolate
[8:25:10] Xeronate: mages should summon portals that kill by sucking the enemy into them and throwign them around the arena
[8:25:11] Sosatko: Mage by itself just feels like it has no kill potential
[8:25:13] Badasti: i dunno I watched a Pres Evoker 1shot himself by dispelling UA earlier LUL
[8:25:17] KaptinKazual: I am wild curious how they did the seeding.
[8:25:20] ImPlutooo: best healer for new players?
[8:25:21] imNillor: I made a devastation evoker recently.. im unsure of it yet. Would anyone else consider devoker similar to balance druid?

[8:26:50] Xeronate: but yes i agree thats a lot
[8:26:55] Nadasky: I can't even be poggers and entertaining for 10 minutes
[8:26:55] nightmxz: "Kubzy's going for a drink again... for the 48th time this game"
[8:26:56] Kymagez: coke is a hella oif a drug
[8:26:57] weevinx: bfa final season was great
[8:27:03] wow_revan: @venruki Someone said that Ziqo is the MAGE GOAT, Is that true ?
[8:27:05] revzzz1: @zerx_gg LUL :D
[8:27:10] nightmxz: "Wealthyman is sheeping off of Chanimal's fear for the 89th time"
[8:27:11] shizbamneato: Not being able to "turn it off" for 15 hrs sounds exhausting
[8:27:14] thyroidxd: unemployed is actually harder than working imo
[8:27:17] dave_seer: LUL
[8:27:20] BeavsBeavs: not the caster vooooice
[8:27:21] healhut: LUL
[8:27:25] starskedc: did you take speach classes to cast better
[8:27:26] dinky_lil: voodoo tote
[8:27:27] McLarge: Y'all remember Ineffable Truth?
[8:27:30] Somanie: @thyroidxd for certain reasons yes, can confirm
[8:27:30] BeavsBeavs: the swap
[8:27:30] Dirkdigglier: bfa season 4 was fun though when all the corruptions were being found out
[8:27:32] abhorath: Can't forget the tank trinkets.
[8:27:34] DaraxBarex: like weather reporter lmao
[8:27:38] morangee: commentate nahj running around valdrakken
[8:27:39] dvoraklol: @McLarge what was that?
[8:27:39] mr_bad__: lamo
[8:27:43] Kymagez: why i never believe anything you say, its just caster ...
[8:27:45] McLarge: Or tanks with Twilight Devastation?
[8:27:46] BeavsBeavs: it's insane to hear that swap live honestly
[8:27:48] waggz: lululululululu
[8:27:51] Alerothan: Yea but then didnt BFA turn into sudden oneshots with Drest and stuff in season 4
[8:27:51] juicymeld: can you link the bracket?
[8:27:52] crawnpocktail: @Dirkdigglier can i just say one thing? fuck void tendrils
[8:27:55] weevinx: hoj stun lock with ineffi truth lol
[8:27:57] nightmxz: Oh yeah remember when MW was disgusting
[8:27:59] Smexxin: take me back :O
[8:28:00] Kymagez: like luigi denying im his son
[8:28:02] thyroidxd: @Somanie especially going to a bunch of job interviews and the uncertainty of things ya know
[8:28:05] Kymagez: lies
[8:28:08] stuntman210: lg?
[8:28:09] nightmxz: And Kubzy MW they hit like 92% damp didn't they?
[8:28:09] dave_seer: KEKW
[8:28:17] GoldenKnightStd: bfa season 4 was actually very fun, super dragon ball Z
[8:28:19] Sosatko: Remember waiting 3 months for ur rotation
[8:28:22] Sosatko: of corruption LOL
[8:28:25] Badasti: 'certain classes' Kappa
[8:28:25] Kymagez: mage needs to die
[8:28:27] nightmxz: @Smexxin I unironically miss bfa but that's cuz I loved arcane mage that xpac LUL
[8:28:27] Arcanocrystal: Nahj probably best transmog'r in wow
[8:28:31] Applezbtw: @venruki that one EU match in bfa where both teams just waited at the pillar for like 15min LUL
[8:28:32] justjoshingyo: like rogues? shouldnt have every cc in the game and every defensive...lol
[8:28:32] DrunkJoe14: I quit pvp in bfa only expansion I’ve ever done that, hated that nothing died
[8:28:33] Kymagez: how bout dat
[8:28:35] DaraxBarex: DF pvp is so much fun. its jsut the queue times thats runinig it
[8:28:37] pvalue01: 3s damp is too slow and shuffle damp is too fast, change my mind
[8:28:40] Eckosaurus: is dampening a better answer than class changes?
[8:28:41] TypicalCalibri: Nerf rogues and dh for sure
[8:28:46] juicymeld: can we link the bracket ?
[8:28:48] X2DR: buff mages
[8:28:49] Semis394: is there a bracket anywhere?
[8:28:49] waggz: feral wall seems bugged. doesnt work
[8:28:52] nephryne: Nahj best rogue in wow, respect
[8:28:52] Tuckbudford: Bring back spite Kappa
[8:28:57] DrunkJoe14: make it start like the damp in solo q
[8:29:00] crawnpocktail: I had the shit that made your cds come back super fast on Hpala in BFA S4, remember using HOJ 3 times in a row lmaooo
[8:29:08] zachgamegodx: outlaw was kinda trash until the rework
[8:29:08] Badasti: I'd be happy to see 1 AWC where Rogues have 0 representation
[8:29:09] varok87: Why there is so few Outlaw Rogues above 2400 in SS.
[8:29:10] Nephhx: rogue lobby too strong
[8:29:11] DaraxBarex: true
[8:29:12] morangee: i'l start to play it, then watch it get nerfed
[8:29:13] starskedc: they just made 5 classes op and made the rest just fun to play o well as long as its fun
[8:29:13] Kymagez: its odd sooo many good pvpers work for blizz and the game sucks
[8:29:14] deepakchoppa: They cloak of shadows the nerfs
[8:29:16] Sosatko: @crawnpocktail Inevitable truth OPP
[8:29:20] Eckosaurus: so i should go main outlaw. gotcha
[8:29:24] allosear: Yeah DH is fine though
[8:29:27] storm_chaser_ron: bro what is that weakaura
[8:29:30] Kymagez: maybe they have no control :O
[8:29:31] storm_chaser_ron: "grip go" on screen
[8:29:32] DaraxBarex: outlaw just has a huge gap between skill floor and ceiling. blizz cant balance it
[8:29:32] gdodmebxu: @allosear KEKW
[8:29:34] storm_chaser_ron: come on man
[8:29:36] Sosatko: @venruki Remember the good ol days waiting a casual 3 months for ur corruption rotation
[8:29:39] crawnpocktail: @Sosatko that with the judgement talent was unbelievably busted fr
[8:29:41] Roundhere_: they should give outlaw red buff killing spree
[8:29:42] Hobblefoot: Outlaw is so fun once you get it
[8:29:44] nightmxz: @Kymagez a  lot of the problems with pvp aren't because of balance, it's because of class design which effects way more than just pvp
[8:29:46] skwiglz: i wish they would rw monks
[8:29:58] b_lappy: kind of brutal in solo shuff with no comms ngl
[8:30:00] dinky_lil: outlaw hides behind sub
[8:30:01] ashleet1: whats the score
[8:30:07] Kymagez: @nightmxz make me some WA's then we can talk
[8:30:09] DaraxBarex: @nightmxz True. They have PVE and raids to keep in mind which is like 95% of the player base
[8:30:10] nephryne: Outlaw is like the most fun rogue spec sadly
[8:30:10] Kymagez: <3
[8:30:22] kand1nsky: instead of nerfing outlaw they should make more classes be like outlaw. hard to master but ablet to make a dif
[8:30:29] mr_bad__: addon that changes character name to spec? @chat
[8:30:31] nightmxz: @Kymagez That'll be years of entertainment or a $1 tip for my fee
[8:30:50] DaraxBarex: @kand1nsky that would just kill the playerbase. Remember 90% are casuals. they wont be able to keep up or have patience to learn harder classes
[8:30:52] Kymagez: i pay well :) ask my hookers
[8:31:02] Somanie: @Kymagez LMAO AYO
[8:31:16] nightmxz: well I didn't expect that response lmao
[8:31:16] zerx_gg: i can confirm
[8:31:21] asenku11k: maybe pet stun
[8:31:23] Kymagez: <3
[8:31:27] palawakeup: is outlaw really that hard to master?
[8:31:46] Badasti: @palawakeup I find it pretty hard to play
[8:31:48] palawakeup: it feels very muscle memory
[8:31:49] McLarge: DH could definitely use a durability nerf. The only thing I'm afraid of dying to on the ladder is Sub Rogue, and even then I can become a pretty difficult kill target if I play really well.
[8:31:50] palawakeup: base
[8:31:52] asenku11k: well nvm cause its destro right
[8:31:53] dankers7: whats the score?
[8:31:57] palawakeup: but once u get that i feel like it almost plays itself
[8:32:00] ripinpeace10: @venruki do you ever cast holy light as holy
[8:32:01] Bmojo: @venruki region aside, what is your opinion of ele vs boom

[8:33:00] DaraxBarex: warrior and hunters where? copium
[8:33:01] FinkleTheMage: I feel like locks are a little crazy atm
[8:33:05] FinkleTheMage: Out of the casters
[8:33:14] chervz: you think healers seem balanced?
[8:33:14] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[8:33:17] Kymagez: i hope he signs up to therapy
[8:33:21] MaroXZX: The second one? There are two?
[8:33:27] justjoshingyo: HEALERS HEAL TOO MUCH
[8:33:27] indrah___: yea casters all good melee DH is broken
[8:33:28] PuffnTuff: he needs to recruit Palumor, Palumor was joking about it today anyway
[8:33:29] smoothytoothy: im sure it gets old but, just watching for abit of crusader is actually hilarious LUL
[8:33:53] WashedUpHasBeen: just remove meld drink and probably best balance we've had
[8:33:56] Kymagez: ive never seen someone so unhinged other than myself.. that guy is something
[8:33:59] Tuckbudford: but disc is s teir in every teir list LUL
[8:34:00] Smexxin: saw a lot of hpriests randomly on eu today too
[8:34:03] healhut: mw slept on imo
[8:34:10] Badasti: I'm enjoying holy priest personally
[8:34:28] smoothytoothy: he is indeed something special LUL @Kymagez
[8:34:28] FinkleTheMage: Hpriest throughput seems great, but the CDs they have to trade feels limited?
[8:34:33] DaraxBarex: clutch
[8:34:38] Smexxin: maybe hpriest dh ele is good Kappa
[8:34:47] Kymagez: Nick <3
[8:34:48] BrokenEarBank: I’m so happy awc is back.. just in time for my second shoulder surgery so I can get back in the cage.
[8:35:03] teslashock1: hpriest would lose on mana
[8:35:03] crawnpocktail: any disc comps at all?
[8:35:06] Badasti: I'm surprised teams are playing Ele instead of Boomkin with DH
[8:35:10] MaroXZX: Sry if youve alrdy done it but could you explain how the cup(s) work? When will the na and EU teams face eachother?
[8:35:11] jasuvex: it rly isnt, u have a damp comp with holy priest that ooms
[8:35:13] dvoraklol: nahj is insane dude
[8:35:17] Eckosaurus: @BrokenEarBank yo man get well soon!
[8:35:21] dvoraklol: indian
[8:35:23] storm_chaser_ron: ravioli
[8:35:24] zerx_gg: shoarma
[8:35:25] Kymagez: @venruki maybe work out like crusader, he has perfect form
[8:35:26] ezmoney3434: what addon is he using that shows the spec under their name?
[8:35:28] Badasti: get a nice fat burger
[8:35:33] RadDadQ: Pho
[8:35:35] smoothytoothy: im surprised more people arent playing outlaw boomy, clearly its still great
[8:35:36] yippey_: I had some nice ramen at the local spot and it was so good
[8:35:37] KaptinKazual: Holy Priest did win a few matches in EU though
[8:35:41] Dalok: KKona
[8:35:42] Darty12111: pasta breadbowl
[8:35:44] DaraxBarex: burger, fries and dr pepper while watching awc. perfect dinnner
[8:35:46] TheBoysCT: Let's go; i'm making burgers right now
[8:35:47] Sosatko: Anyone have a link tothe bracket?
[8:35:48] Rakitotv: get some Vietnamese
[8:35:48] spankfest11: BIG SHWARMA
[8:35:52] mvpala_tv: for sure figured you were vegan
[8:35:53] TheBoysCT: cooking and lurking
[8:35:54] KaptinKazual: Bicmex got absolutely wrecked by a team with holy priest
[8:35:57] BrokenEarBank: @eckosaurus appreciate it!!
[8:35:59] Bradskey: Just get an Una Pizza dawg, can't go wrong
[8:36:05] smoothytoothy: he was for a longtime @wowhanslol
[8:36:05] zen_oni_shinobi: tacos
[8:36:05] spankfest11: Hes from Alberta.. No chance hes Vegan
[8:36:10] Kikrino: Im craving tacos atm. Damn
[8:36:12] ezmoney3434: what addon is he using that shows the spec under their name? anyone know?
[8:36:25] McLarge: @Badasti They're both really solid options, but Ele is just a bit more durable overall I think. It's also better synergy with a Resto Druid than a Boomy has, and that's the best healer
[8:36:28] DaraxBarex: @ezmoney3434 most likely betterblizzplates
[8:36:32] SincerelyNikola: are you casting any of the touney?
[8:36:35] Kymagez: im in the sticks... nothing takeaway near me :(
[8:36:36] thyroidxd: wheres the outlaw kill potential
[8:36:37] SincerelyNikola: sorry just tuned in
