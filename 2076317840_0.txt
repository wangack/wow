[2:37:29] majkos: @fredslfm well., its still the same amount of hero talent trees, only 1 less for DH which will get only 1 hero tree
[2:37:38] majkos: all the other classes gets 3 and druid 4
[2:37:44] MrGharr: next season or TWW?
[2:38:08] IAmSolari: holy

[2:42:24] FlasheeTv: FlasheeTv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! i just wanna see the deathstalker now !
[2:42:40] brotan123: that rule is insane
[2:42:40] majkos: maybe after 20 years its time to fix pets going through walls :D
[2:43:06] xoljinn59: it s the same shit about rise strategy, must no exist
[2:43:23] SyMmBoLz: PET game design issue lol
[2:43:32] bingbongsanchez22: like my bm pets, they are everywhere but not in side the pull KEKW
[2:43:39] chutnii: dorki's team asked and the admins said no about that exact strat
[2:43:42] OldManHeph: Maybe they should disqualify the 2 bears before the first boss that also run through the wall mid-combat
[2:44:56] legendossay: He mentioned it on their podcast (him and max and dratty)
[2:45:28] majkos: Did you ask admins about that Rise strat (or fall)
[2:45:35] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[2:45:53] MrGharr: Honestly they should just enable rise portals to be usable mid combat.
[2:46:24] n_Blow: what they should do, is hard wall it. Once they go through, if the mobs cant they drop aggro and reset. That would solve the issue of that
[2:46:45] kheim: Who figured out the rise strat?
[2:47:09] DodhTV: @kheim Good question
[2:47:33] kheim: seems like a naowh thing to figure out
[2:47:43] ThreshTheDuck: like the plaguefall case ? KEKW
[2:47:52] legendossay: I think theyre too worried that the game doesnt look polished if it becomes a bug/exploit showcase event
[2:47:57] majkos: @n_Blow extra way to force mobs drop aggro in dungeon would also be abuse-able :D
[2:48:19] IAmSolari: I think this MDI has been the best one in years
[2:48:28] MrGharr: For competitor fairness this is better
[2:48:47] n_Blow: @majkos Not when it comes to count. They still would need to kill them for count.
