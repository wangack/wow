[1:50:15] LoneRobo: I would :)
[1:50:19] JuicyDoubles: danOMG
[1:50:26] DrWraithjr: NODDERS Skulls for the skull throne
[1:50:27] Big_Headed_Gamer: @bantuatha not for retail cause they get all legal. they don't care about classic.
[1:50:41] Velo22222: danKappa danSnow danSnow danDrool
[1:50:50] 5hoo: IRL they would pile up thousands of buffalo skulls as they were hunted to extinction
[1:51:09] 5hoo: they likes the trophies
[1:51:10] bantuatha: @Big_Headed_Gamer So is all good for Vanilla, BC and WotlK? (soon Cata)
[1:51:14] 5hoo: liked FeelsDankMan
[1:51:21] NeonFlux: After playing shaman a bit I would be careful untill get that chain mail on later, leather armor is pretty weak
[1:51:22] Big_Headed_Gamer: @bantuatha apparently
[1:51:25] bantuatha: Since when?
[1:51:50] 5hoo: RareDan
[1:52:01] B_T_23: LUL
[1:52:02] 5hoo: pepeLaugh
[1:52:03] NeonFlux: Lev40 I think chainmail
[1:52:09] gslaves: Owl now extra wise
[1:52:11] Celebrim1: Trying to make him wise like an owl
[1:52:13] 5hoo: but now its more wise 5Head
[1:52:14] CapitalMarket: LUL
[1:52:25] Big_Headed_Gamer: @NeonFlux you should def be running shaman with a group. there chain heal is the strongest heal in the game.
[1:52:26] NeonFlux: Leather is fine if your a druid or rogue
[1:52:26] Velo22222: but now he is blessed AngelThump
[1:52:35] Big_Headed_Gamer: @bantuatha SHRUG

[1:52:46] CptTeempo: danD
[1:52:47] thereisacow: push those dps SteerR
[1:52:59] NeonFlux: Warrior get plate at 40 shaman and Hunter get chain mail at 40 makes huge dufference
[1:53:15] gslaves: That would be wild to level together with 40 people in sync
[1:53:45] nolraizer24: danLurk
[1:53:54] NeonFlux: Yeah I wanted respect rest healer but all the raid hardcore deaths it's usually the healer gets one shot lol
[1:54:02] bantuatha: Maybe a fun dungeon with almost over leveled can be less risk with group
[1:54:07] CptTeempo: danS
[1:54:09] Velo22222: @nolraizer24 danLurk
[1:54:43] bantuatha: One day, BC hardcore will happen
[1:54:58] el_puesto: @Corion82 yeah, but after playing wow classic for almost 3 years, and then reinstalling it...it might work out of the box
[1:55:19] SeboNarro: 4Head
[1:55:22] thereisacow: 4Head
[1:55:25] Big_Headed_Gamer: @NeonFlux that's because the pool of people with brains for classic is so small. majority on classic HC right now are people who are utter clueless about grouping because retail spoils them. they don't know how to "protect the healer" but you also can't do much unless you have some levels under your belt and abilities.
[1:55:30] Big_Headed_Gamer: WutFace essay
