[2:52:26] martymcfly8711: and i can tell youre having a blast
[2:55:02] benjams8: Realistically was is an expected item level for +15 keys
[2:56:34] martymcfly8711: @benjams8 depends, have you been playing all season? no reason youre not 480+
[2:56:42] martymcfly8711: if its an alt or something than it just depends.
[2:57:17] axellent_x: do u think the person that designed this fight was like, im sure ppl can do this without addons
[2:57:26] benjams8: I'm a relatively new player, I'm at 460
[2:57:42] clickermekk: I'm still progging this boss in my guild our best is 39%.. I couldnt imagine trying to reclear this boss for FUN
[2:58:08] mrtiimmy: @clickermekk how many pulls you at?
[2:58:32] clickermekk: ill have to check WC logs
[2:58:53] clickermekk: @mrtiimmy 340
[2:59:16] mrtiimmy: ohh nice my guild at like 200 I think and we just started making it to p2 a lttle more consistent
[3:00:01] mrtiimmy: we struggle with the roster boss more than anything tbh XD
[3:00:04] clickermekk: @mrtiimmy hey thats pretty good. yea once u get P2 down its seems p3 is mostly the same but faster with overlaps
[3:00:41] mrtiimmy: @clickermekk Yea p2 doesnt seem crazy hard so far compared to p1 but not excited for p3
[3:03:28] mrtiimmy: does everyone get the mythic mount or do only a couple of people get them per mythic fyrakk?
[3:04:26] clickermekk: @mrtiimmy i think 2?
[3:04:42] durcu: wish 2 per kill continued in season 4 instead of being cut short
[3:05:22] mrtiimmy: what do they plan for season 4? the horrible .1% drop rate or are they gonna guarntee a mount at least?
[3:05:34] mrtiimmy: just want one for my druid lol
[3:06:10] Sokchoy: eat jamdotb sleep jamdotb rave jamdotb repeat jamdotb eat jamdotb sleep jamdotb rave jamdotb repeat jamdotb eat jamdotb sleep jamdotb rave jamdotb repeat jamdotb

[3:06:54] MlleSasa: Hi everyone, I’ve been watching you play for a while now and I would like to know what brand of headphones you have? Thank you in advance for your answer
[3:07:14] MicHawkh: !earpods

[3:09:30] MlleSasa: thx
[3:15:48] mrtiimmy: HIs game looks like it runs soo smoothly Feel like my comp almost dies everytime roots come out lol
[3:16:07] mrtiimmy: lowest graphics and like 70% rendering scale too
[3:20:18] dertrapov: fuckkk
[3:20:21] Valvol1NE: @mrtiimmy lower the rate details updates the meters to the minimum. Details causes insane lag if you have it to update fast
[3:21:36] dertrapov: @mrtiimmy idk if you use vuhdo, but disabling logging on that fixed my lag for tindral
[3:21:38] mrtiimmy: @Valvol1NE I always switch it back to 100% i just heard turning it down for tswift helped
[3:22:00] mystifyfps: just gained like 40 fps
[3:22:01] mystifyfps: doing that
[3:22:06] mystifyfps: i was wondering what was going on
[3:22:39] Valvol1NE: @mrtiimmy im talking about details , your addon, not your render scale. Lowering how fast details updates ,also helps with fps
[3:23:01] xpungax: xpungax subscribed with Prime. 
[3:23:14] mrtiimmy: oh yea sorry was going to respond to you then responded to Jdotb instead XD ill thinking ill just turn off details later when we doing our pulls
[3:25:13] Valvol1NE: i thought the render scale bug was fixed , apparently not cause i also just changed it and it literally gave me 20fps extra FML
[3:27:43] Blabyone: catJAM
