[2:29:49] extremelytouchable: @BadgerHuman affix caused teera/maruuk boss to only heal one. it reset the boss. people want a remake because they blame blizz and not the strategy.

[2:29:55] AuRora7: Healing a boss with Sanguine and adding a few seconds is up to players, the boss resetting entirely due to a bug never before seen is "up to the players"? lol
[2:29:57] Moethelion: @xshift8 Sure its a bug. But you can recreate it and also avoid it. It could be abused if they remake it
[2:29:58] riptack_: LUL
[2:29:58] Rozeblaadje: gooooo
[2:29:59] xShift8: True, but it is a bug. They should AT LEAST acknowledge it is a bug and fix it.

[2:30:24] kibe_horde: double trow
[2:30:26] desjy: LETS GO THUNDERED
[2:30:27] imAndrewRussell: @runnesvoid They gave one of the bosses 20% more HP with Senguine. Therefore not killing them both at same time. Not a bug
[2:30:30] Thoreya: Clown fiesta LUL
[2:30:33] ArnesMeyer: Lets go thunderstruck !!
[2:30:35] placeholderx: CrreamAwk

[2:30:48] Eploar: GO GO THUNDERSTRUCK GO GO THUNDERSTRUCK GO GO THUNDERSTRUCK
[2:30:50] extremelytouchable: @BadgerHuman I completely agree with this sentiment and agree it was a poor strategy for the affixes.
[2:30:59] Maxheadspace: Another close one by time
[2:31:02] PaperCodes: @imAndrewRussell It absolutely is. Obviously Blizz never took that scenario into account when they coded the shared health
[2:31:04] dkdyngen: remake, bosses share hp wtf?? sang should not heal 1 boss, when they share lol
[2:31:05] droogzand: why remake ? ,they let the boss heal with sanguine
[2:31:06] xShift8: @Moethelion I agree. I agree. But in this case you KNOW that thunderstruck did NOT do that on purpose-- they were doing great(only 1 death) and had no reason to do so. Admins should consider that when deciding remake or not.
[2:31:10] desjy: thundered for the win
[2:31:10] Naguura: remakes are not done unless the dungeon can not be finished bc of a bug, and no matter what happened here it didnt prevent them from finishing
[2:31:11] FlasheeTv: @runnesvoid the problem is that it shoulda healed both boss.
[2:31:14] Trellsky: THE THUNDERDOME
[2:31:14] Naguura: thats just how the MDI rules are
[2:31:15] Xenon_cl: bru what is this game
[2:31:16] Eploar: GO GO THUNDERSTRUCK GO GOTHUNDERSTRUCK!!!!
[2:31:22] jaredius1: never allow such similar team names again
[2:31:31] PaperCodes: If a boss shares damage, they should also share healing. That is an obvious coding issue.
[2:31:32] Ontarin92: no shot
[2:31:32] AuRora7: then the boss should enrage and wipe them or something, not entirely reset because Blizz never considered that scenario
[2:31:32] dechard1235: @droogzand Because they're supposed to share health, and it only healed one of them which bugged out the boss...??
[2:31:37] Maxheadspace: LOL
[2:31:38] imAndrewRussell: @PaperCodes Not a bug, If you're supposed to kill both at same time, and You as the player boost the HP of one of them.. that's a Player error
[2:31:42] desjy: LETS ALL TAKE A SECOND and realise that the team thunderstruck caused the reset and move on no remake
[2:31:43] Bearman999: 3 deathas nowi think thundered has it
[2:31:48] chandleriab: heals oom

[2:31:59] theta_sigma213: the bosses do NOT actually share health. the ability is called life link and states that the damage done to one is copied to the other
[2:32:00] ShotcallerSup: @Naguura I'll asume they (rules) changed since Legion? Genuine question
[2:32:01] extorrislilman: It’s should have healed both bosses not just one it should be a remake

[2:32:09] Eploar: @Trellsky A fight of THUNDERED and THUNDERSTRUCKagainst a THUNDER BOSS
[2:32:11] thebamfshow: or maybe people should consider not pulling sanguine trash onto boss then they wouldnt have whiped
[2:32:11] FlasheeTv: @PaperCodes not how a "shared" health pool should work
[2:32:13] PaperCodes: @PaperCodes You don’t kill both at the same time, the game kills both at the same time. They literally share damage taken. Aka, they should also share healing
[2:32:13] dechard1235: @PaperCodes you're "supposed to kill them at the same time" because they literally share a health pool, lol. thus, they should also share healing
[2:32:17] runnesvoid: my bad

[2:34:28] placeholderx: @telomir there I no calm in our dictionary BabyRage
[2:34:30] moderatygos: teams know how sanguine works, they took a risk killing a lot of adds on the bosses. unfortunate what happened, but not within the rules of a remake
[2:34:30] TheNeithorn: @TheNeithorn its technical issue boss share health and they dont died boss just reset bcs he jump out of arena
[2:34:31] thetastyskin: @Biggershoe it makes them deal more damage. have you played wow before? :)

[2:34:51] beebee023: Joel
[2:34:53] PaperCodes: @moderatygos For sure, I understand it can't really be remade because it is abusable. Unfortunate :(
[2:34:55] ChadOrc: @moderatygos they knew sanguine resets boss?
[2:34:59] frriiedd: boss should jus enrage not reset
[2:34:59] desjy: LETS GO THUNDERED
[2:35:01] vroht: @moderatygos But they were ahead. Wouldn’t have made sense to purposefully wipe to the bug and expect a rematch.
[2:35:04] thebamfshow: @thebamfshow did we just watch the same thing? yes they did, pulled add onto boss wiht sanguine that doesnt move. lollolol
[2:35:06] Telomir: did thunderstruck thderstrike themselves of the series?
[2:35:08] TheGreatChibix: Sanguine literally resetting bosses —> working as intended, lol nice joke company
[2:35:08] patlatzan: Fanbois angry
[2:35:08] mazzubeta: remake
[2:35:09] elpartepapo: Remake 👍
[2:35:12] darkhorror93: isnt beast caller gripable? how can this happen
[2:35:12] papisigis: Remake is needed, small indie company
[2:35:13] xShift8: @moderatygos That makes sense-- but thunderstruck was doing GREAT. Only 1 death. Admins can make the call to remake here. IF they were way behind then absolutely no remake. The boss RESET on what was otherwise a beautiful run.
[2:35:15] Ultrasword: nobody knew though, if thunderstruck knew they would have reset
[2:35:17] AuRora7: no one knew it would reset the boss including the casters
[2:35:17] Wordy92: thats why you ban nokud
[2:35:20] frriiedd: remake :)
[2:35:21] jaredius1: half the time comentators were talking about Thundered but meant Thunderstruck and vice versa
[2:35:22] donnjj: Reset wasnt fair.
[2:35:28] Mevraz: Git gud, no remake kekw
[2:35:28] Moethelion: Casters should really clarify there
[2:35:29] Telomir: remake needs to happen. I hope thunderstruck appeals this.
[2:35:29] buranaw: what a sad way to end series though
[2:35:29] mstanfield99: If boss share health they should share healing
[2:35:30] DocReoTV: lol Not just Nokhud lol
[2:35:31] moderatygos: @vroht thats not the point. the point is that it has to be applied consistently. the same way you can't reset if someone loses internet, unfortunate, but has to apply consistently
[2:35:33] CaptainJaxone: what a joke.  resetting boss
[2:35:33] frriiedd: yeah if they kew theyw ould have reset boss -.-
[2:35:34] Seidrrr: remake, bugged boss
[2:35:39] vengeful0ne: "that they had the boss despawn" KEKW
[2:35:40] mmschenkyy: stop cry omg...

[2:35:41] remi_2005: alt f4 KEKW
[2:35:42] extremelytouchable: @mstanfield99 why?
[2:35:44] Maxheadspace: Remake for the LuL's
[2:35:44] Xavo_TTV: my keyboard would have died
[2:35:46] PaperCodes: @moderatygos Except the healing should be shared if damage taken is shared. An affix shouldn't cause a complete reset, and it's nice to at least acknowledge that.
[2:35:47] paegggr: casters kidding or what?
[2:35:48] Arniboy: Meeix should stop talking
[2:35:50] Ultrasword: thunder struck would have reset the boss fight if they knew it would have resulted in a reset of the boss anyways
[2:35:53] Elrock15: Remake
[2:35:53] zacaries_: @donnjj it was their own doing, so yes it was very fair
[2:35:54] erfih: idk how you can just say its a player error, its not stated anywhere that they have to die at the same time
[2:35:54] WoWsallyTV: Healing should be shared if damage is shared. REMAKE
[2:35:54] frriiedd: remakeee
[2:35:55] ShelviJ: ...
[2:35:57] taika17: it doesn't matter if either of these teams win, they're gonna get destroyed by Cheese, move on!
[2:35:58] thebamfshow: not even bugged, literally user error by pulling sanguine add onto boss that doesnt move
[2:35:59] EzzLyfe: @paegggr wdym?
[2:36:03] woahdudewhat: RAGEY  󠀀
[2:36:03] Zevram86: Who codes a boss to jump outside the arena? gg Blizzard
[2:36:04] Icyxox: Definitely should be a remake, both bosses should've been healed
[2:36:07] buranaw: who wants to win by another teams boss bugging out
[2:36:11] desjy: @moderatygos cant even argue with this level of logic
[2:36:11] evilprinz: same lifepool same healing
[2:36:12] steelwill66: They thought the boss was dead why else mount up
[2:36:12] elpartepapo: Remaaaaaake
[2:36:13] donnjj: So it was
[2:36:13] Aljan95: its not a bug literally
[2:36:13] papisigis: Remake is fair
[2:36:14] zacaries_: @Arniboy maybe u should stop watching
[2:36:17] PaperCodes: @thebamfshow So a boss who shares damage taken shouldn't share healing?
[2:36:18] Taddict: @zacaries_ IF THEY HAVE SHARE HP IT SHOULDBOTH HEAL WTHAT DO U MEAN
[2:36:19] Biggershoe: "In the tank"? who the f is this
[2:36:19] AuRora7: Blizzard will patch this bug soon
[2:36:21] ponydanzax: can't call it a "tournament" with clown rules
[2:36:21] ArnesMeyer: Healing should be shared if damage is shared. REMAKE
[2:36:25] Aljan95: they just had an oopzie cause of the healing
[2:36:25] old_ratboy: explain it to thundered. if theyre okay with remake lets do that?
[2:36:27] the_general01: @Zevram86 looooooooooooool
[2:36:28] vookus: if this doesnt get remade mdi is a joke
[2:36:29] owker_lol: what happens?
[2:36:29] jaredius1: why are we still debating a boss where we all know you have to kill both same time?
[2:36:31] minjiang2: Better team definitely didn’t win in this game.
[2:36:32] donnjj: So it was bad game design.
[2:36:32] papisigis: She was inside, this needs a remake
[2:36:33] Kershyll: nobody did, the corpse despawned
[2:36:37] 2maron: coding issue

[2:36:43] michaelbluth: remake remake remake
[2:36:43] Muzluk: the boss should not jump into a place it could reset
[2:36:45] Nivaly: But that would be a bugged boss. If the spellqueue let the boss reset.
[2:36:46] minjiang2: There is no doubt that better team didn’t work that round.
[2:36:47] KillerMike: So when remake?
[2:36:49] Telomir: Thunderstruck BibleThump
[2:36:49] the_general01: gg thundered. enjoy advanment :D
[2:36:51] thebamfshow: @thebamfshow coulda killed sanguine add elsewhere right?
[2:36:51] desjy: @minjiang2 thats where your wrong
[2:36:52] DhuumFPS: ROBBED LUL
[2:36:53] theta_sigma213: y'all need to read the tool tips better lol. No shared health, no shared healing, only an ability called "life link" that states damage done to one is copied to the other
[2:36:53] xShift8: @Zevram86 Commentators wrong-- boss reset because one boss died first. The boss will not jump out of arena area for reset, so that was not the cause
[2:36:54] Elrock15: Take it to VAR
[2:36:56] nervio2701: 30Million sanguine healing, that was it for them
[2:36:56] AverageDaeg: does sangine ichor stream?
[2:36:57] PaperCodes: @jaredius1 You don’t have to kill both at the same time. They share 100% damage taken, it naturally happens.
[2:36:58] namedaccount: @jaredius1 they literally share hp - you don't "have to do anything"
[2:36:58] Mevraz: Git gud baddies no remake :D
[2:37:02] TuskAroni: it was a legit issue on the design of the boss vs the affix
[2:37:02] mmschenkyy: 30mio sanguine and they cry for remake LUL
[2:37:03] CptNo: ITS NOT FAIR  THAT A TEAM WHO  DIE MUCH THEN OTHER TO WIN, BEACUSE OF A BUG. REMAKE BLIZZARD!
[2:37:04] extremelytouchable: it was an affix put onto the boss, that's not a coding issue. nobody said they share healing and damage. its obvious they only share damage.
[2:37:04] desjy: thundered for the win
[2:37:05] Lovin89: this is a remake easy
[2:37:06] whisperwow: remake, code issue
[2:37:07] jaredius1: if you dont kill same time, bad things happen let us move on
[2:37:08] EzzLyfe: @jaredius1 you dont have a choice, thats why. Their HP goes down together, but one was healed, so it was impossible to kill at the same time

[2:41:34] Tiabbz: Did DOA get fired or something?
[2:41:34] Azack: sanguine healing isnt a bug read the boss ability tooltips LUL
[2:41:36] TuskAroni: @zacaries_ the reset on the boss is the bug. There is zero doubt that the case it was due to an ability targeting a dead boss
[2:41:42] Telomir: @zacaries_ LOL!
[2:41:44] Flagspin: it's bad coded boss fight  but mdi remake rules are clear: only when game can not be completed

[2:41:46] dyxothegod: what happend to thunderstruck?
[2:41:46] desjy: nothing was bugged  people get a grip if u let a boss thats supped to be killed at the same time heal its up to you to do the difference to bring it back
[2:41:48] extremelytouchable: @extremelytouchable I say that because that's literally how the Spirit Link works. I don't know why you guys keep addling layers. Spirit Link works one singular way. if one takes damage so does the other.
[2:41:48] whisperwow: it's a bug, the boss reset due to not handling all cases by a what seems to be "small indie company"
[2:41:51] Wordy92: there fault for not banning the dungeon GG
[2:41:51] TuskAroni: outside that boss that would never happen
[2:41:51] ModeraYsera: @Tiabbz not at all, he just is busy this weekend

[2:42:10] AriyWariy: boss resets himself and you cant play around it "not a bug"
[2:42:12] Muzluk: @Muzluk how so? either it has jump into a zone it resets, which should not happen or it resets because of out of sync health, which also not happen

[2:42:23] Kiel0Hyre: @dechard1235 It didn’t instantly reset, it reset after like 15 seconds of not killing two bosses you are supposed to kill at the same time at the same time xD
[2:42:24] zacaries_: @TuskAroni it wasnt a bug, the boss healths werent at the same cause the team had one stand in Sang which healed it, player error not bug
[2:42:25] desjy: HOW ABOUT we get rid of affixs and just keep seaonal and the first row like tyran or fort

[2:42:54] Multibocks: Bug

[2:43:00] ChadOrc: @quyn agreed
[2:43:02] desjy: @FlasheeTv there legit was no bug like seriously
[2:43:06] erfih: it says nowhere in the dungeon journal that they should die at the same time, obviously a bug
[2:43:06] Wordy92: everyone has extra propane tanks and for your gas lighters
[2:43:08] jabbatheyutt: im not sure why are people being silenced for discussing something that clearly wasn't intended? ive never seen a boss despawn in the boss area be intentional coding
[2:43:12] jaredius1: folks complaining about bugs are same folks who play the victim
[2:43:19] Muzluk: We need to know the exact reason for the reset
[2:43:19] dechard1235: @s2khieeeel It instantly reset on the bugged ability cast, is what I mean. I don't think you realise what happened. It's not a timer that starts and then resets, it's that the it's not supposed to be possible for only 1 to be alive, so it bugged out and reset
[2:43:20] desjy: there was no bug thunderstruck needs to plan for the affix
[2:43:25] Aljan95: They went for a risky play and it didnt pan out stop crying jeez
[2:43:26] zacaries_: @whogivesashtt bosses despawn all the time, not a bug.
[2:43:26] FlasheeTv: @FlasheeTv Isn't it what i just said?
[2:43:26] TuskAroni: @zacaries_ like many have said is shared health, they both should off healed the same amount as they take the same dmg. AKA a bug that they did not

[2:44:07] Alireno: Let the people discuss things. It’s their right in chat.
[2:44:08] old_ratboy: @thebamfshow yes but once that happened it was fixable as the dmg is still shared, so one boss dies before the other which resets it

[2:44:52] desjy: gaslighting is a made up word by people losing arguments
[2:44:53] whisperwow: it despawned during a cast that was apparently coded to be possible only when both bosses are alive, and hence it despawned. seems like a bug
[2:44:57] jabbatheyutt: @lostinrain1 yes! people do that all the time.
[2:44:58] Woliance: @reloadedtwopointohh One team had a sanguine drop under one of the third bosses, causing it to heal, after one of them died (they share damage taken) the boss reset

[2:49:26] primemnster: @Ultrasword Sanguine healed one boss but not the other. Due to their debuff (damage taken is shared with other boss) you cannot even the health. When one boss died the other tried to cast an ability on the "dead" boss. This caused a reset.
[2:49:31] FlasheeTv: @steelwill66 nah could be "dmg shared" actually

[2:50:49] Muzluk: @loyal2thesea let's be more precise: the dev did not think about the possibility of unsync'd health
[2:50:50] ChadOrc: @jens_der_stachel fr
[2:51:00] thebamfshow: @2916nick look up arena schedule, its a minor niche in the game
[2:51:03] frriiedd: pi is shadow priest buff not unholy :P
[2:51:03] jellyjoint: meeix is the best
[2:51:03] Boogley87: @jaredius1 Nobody is saying that is the bug, it's the interaction between the shared health bosses after that they are speaking about.
[2:51:07] dechard1235: @loyal2thesea If you go watch the replay, it's literally what you could see happen on the screen; not a guess.
[2:51:13] loyal2thesea: @muzluk lol truth
[2:51:15] TuskAroni: Muzluk is correct pretty sure this never happens on live
[2:51:24] Ultrasword: @muzluk that's not precise though, that's just speculation
[2:51:29] 2916nick: @2916nick it got more viewers than these dungeon runs LUL
[2:51:31] the_general01: y'all still talking about past games with a different better banger series goin? Hhhehehe
[2:51:33] desjy: can we time out this dude hes trolling talk about entitlement
[2:51:34] FlasheeTv: Actually if they had a bit more dps maybe it wouldn't reset
[2:51:35] mksmoke55: easy fix would be to change the bosses from taking the same damage to having a shared life pool. like that the other boss should also be healed no?
[2:51:37] ChadOrc: @muzluk good thing they do the proper amount of beta testing and fix reported bugs Kappa

[2:51:40] AriyWariy: @Boogley87 and this interaction is a bug 100%
[2:51:49] moderatygos: lot of speculation, i would love to know how many teams on live keys pull stacks of mobs into this boss
[2:51:53] buranaw: affixes should not be able to break a boss
[2:52:01] primemnster: @Ultrasword Yes
[2:52:08] PaperCodes: @Ultrasword It absolutely is precise
[2:52:08] thebamfshow: @the_general01 to be fair, thunderstruck could have and should have won every match they played in this weekend but shot themselves in the foot few to many times
[2:52:13] old_ratboy: jared they cant fix the hp pool difference by focusing one boss and ignore the other. do you know how it works at all?
[2:52:15] desjy: ill admit it ive seenthe light they bosses shoulve been healed together... BUG
[2:52:17] buranaw: @moderatygos does that matter though? It's broken interaction which should not exist
[2:52:27] jabbatheyutt: @moderatygos you don't have to be the one doing the pulls to care how the interaction works to tournament teams
[2:52:34] Ultrasword: @papercodes if you think assumptions are precise that would be a you issue imho
[2:52:36] FlasheeTv: @moderatygos my tank is too scared when she pull big.. So pulling in a boss? Not a chance sadly D:
[2:52:38] Ben_asri: Goat laugh
[2:52:39] PaperCodes: @moderatygos What part is speculation, Tygos?
[2:52:45] the_general01: @the_general01 maybe, but they didnt win and its over now plink
[2:52:48] Muzluk: @Ultrasword it is so easy to oversee some edge cases (this is way we have some many software vulnerabilities and bugs)
[2:52:50] drunkenbear1: it is sad to see every run is a mirror teams
[2:52:54] USA_Indigo: im a vengeance demon hunter, i leveled alone as vengeance because of the awesome self healing, i need to become a good group tank. is there any tutorials for that?

[2:54:48] thebamfshow: @randompally1953 then they deserve to lose if they cant do mechanics properly, grip/root it out then kill it?
[2:54:54] old_ratboy: its definitely not intended and a loophole. still the circumstances arent enough for a remake. grey area and imo normal that people discuss this issue here

[2:55:15] desjy: yeah but if the boss shares health and sanguine pools  might only heal one of them thats on you... these are the best in the world they should know better
[2:55:20] the_general01: @Doshamuri toys
[2:55:31] TuskAroni: The one thing you cant say they are bad, is mechanics this team are playing super risky and with top skill
[2:55:38] Zeldryx: burp?
[2:55:43] TuskAroni: The sanguine boss heal was an accident
[2:55:46] extremelytouchable: @randompally1953 They don't share hp. that's not what happens. They have different hp pools and a spell called Spirit Link
[2:55:48] goofybootsz: omg share themic
[2:55:52] torx10: why cheese so low?
[2:56:02] erfih: @randompally1953 still doesnt explain why it should despawn
[2:56:13] old_ratboy: yea jaredius1 you definitely not trolling at all
[2:56:38] speedy11208: @erfih the casters explained teraa tried to cast tepel on maruk but he wasnt there
[2:56:42] desjy: @randompally1953 it despanwed because of the move spirit link duhhhhh
[2:56:44] ModeraYsera: @randompally1953 They sanguined a boss up, killed one of the bosses, the second boss tries to cast on the first one (which is now friendly) and it resets. The admin ruling is that it was still completable, so no remake.
[2:56:46] extremelytouchable: @randompally1953 nope, it doesn't casters didn't know the reason why either and assumed it was range.
[2:56:50] genejitsu: y we got spriest pov?
[2:56:59] mksmoke55: @randompally1953 i guess the defeated boss wanted some kind of interaction with the other one but couldnt target it
[2:57:12] TuskAroni: @erfih it happens due to the boss targeting something that did not exist. The equivalent as dividing by zero. causes an error=reset to fix. Napkin explanation
[2:57:23] Ultrasword: testing
[2:57:24] Piroshkiii: @genejitsu Why not?
[2:57:24] brewses: huge respect for the healers on this second boss that storm is no joke
[2:57:31] loyal2thesea: I bet thunderstruck didn’t even know it was possible for the bosses health to desync via sanguine. It’s the opposite of what you’d assume since they share health so you’d have to see it in action, probably more than once to be confident of that interaction.
[2:57:34] ManagerNickylove: My friend Trigzy LOVES MDI
[2:57:38] old_ratboy: @ModeraYsera word. totally understandable decision and Im sure none of admins or casters are happy with something happening like that
[2:57:39] desjy: well looks like thunderstruck caused thier own demise get over it people

[2:58:06] Maxheadspace: to be fair, Thundered was already warmed up for this dungeon

[3:06:40] slausbang: More because I'm tired of the same meta comps on every team,
[3:06:44] RobbingHood: @papercodes Let's see how sweaty they can be
[3:06:53] ArnesMeyer: 10.0.7 before grand finals? :>
[3:07:00] desjy: LETS GO THUNDERED
[3:07:09] EzzLyfe: @TuskAroni not that many really. if u ban dk the go-to is usually a fire mage or a warlock.... with 90% of cases being the mage, so u would just be seeing mages everywhere
[3:07:18] MuRRRkn: meeix with the 500iq tips pog
[3:07:24] Xyronic: @genejitsu disagree.
[3:07:27] Imhuko: most comps have been similar in MDI, banning a class just means itd be exactly like it is, with random classes sprinkled in
[3:07:27] erfih: LUL
[3:07:30] TuskAroni: still more than 1 so no second best
[3:07:31] Xyronic: without the players there is no competition
[3:07:32] desjy: when is 10.0.7 we shouldve had that in the game 2 weeks ago come on blizzard lets get to going with the content
[3:07:33] DaBo00: I have yet to see a Hunter, granted I haven't watched all of the runs... are hunters just not good enough currently? (Good/Utility)
[3:07:33] PaperCodes: @genejitsu If you make the sport require so much of a player, they might not even compete
[3:07:47] thebamfshow: wow see how they booped the add so it didnt sanguine the boss?
[3:07:49] f4m4sb0bi: how many matches do they play after this one ?

[3:09:00] twin512bass: @ultrasword yes with a BDK so dope
[3:09:02] buranaw: Maybe just have a requirement that one class / spec needs to be changed from map to map, would remove using single comp for all. Might still be too much to practice

[3:11:11] Buffalo_Brasky: The meta changes from season to season, but it annoys people seeing the same 5-6 classes in a single season

[3:11:36] PaperCodes: @Shearin77 He means seasons, bro
[3:11:37] slausbang: The meta doesn't always change significantly though, so there are certain classes that have been top for ages.
[3:11:39] narcyboo: @Buffalo_Brasky agreed, was nice to see the fire mages and the rare hunter thoigh!
[3:12:03] slausbang: Anyone seen any warlocks?
