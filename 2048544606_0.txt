[0:40:06] stealthsp: Salam brother chuck
[0:40:11] ll_Meru_ll: touch applies before the barrage hits
[0:40:13] aant02: the projectile arrives just as the touch gets cast
[0:40:13] Wopsi: yea and the barrage damage will proc magi when hit if done from a bit of range
[0:40:14] Swishinn: it applies before barrage hits bc travel time

[2:58:34] Solastro: @cdewx  i dont understand why they gave skyreach a choice node and arent giving verdant one
[2:58:35] asdkl2312k3o: how is ur healing with that much mast
[2:58:51] hipsterdufus: but it's cool being able to use verdant to get away
[2:58:57] mayfire15: some dude was trying to say in raiku’s stream you said pres was auto win against rdruid lol
[2:59:02] chinchin23: @d0ncojones idk if you understand he seen nothing on his screen other than his toon thats so hard to do vs RM very hard
[2:59:03] jasonkbkt: Where did u get that mog?
[2:59:06] opiaatteit: do you have your rdruid macros  to copy ?
[2:59:10] Swishinn: verdant is too big of a heal to waste for mobility
[2:59:18] zachgamegodx: dev can do it, pres needs to use it to heal the guy in need of healing
[2:59:24] FlynnFluff: verdant embrace should send a dragon effigy to the target to heal that’d be a cool design
[2:59:31] Solastro: just give verdant the skyreach choice talent
[2:59:33] Solastro: ez fix
[2:59:37] shredder1111: raiku seems to think shaman is best healer now
[3:00:07] sanctusirl: Why isn't clone on a cd like rep? Clone makes me sad.
[3:00:08] ImPlutooo: What else would be better?
[3:00:16] d0ncojones: @chinchin23 saw this too he played against roque mage so there is no heal either. he waited to get full and do his rotation wasn’t that impressive or high skilled u thing if u know ur class over 200k games like pika so yeah
[3:00:27] mnowpsn: Did u see jahmillis prediction list
[3:00:30] bignoooodle: is rogue boomy S tier?
[3:00:37] Solastro: @sanctusirl i mean why isnt fear and poly on cd then too
[3:00:38] FoxiekittenWoW: echo seems to think shaman is best now, druid oom too fast and it’s too hard to get good drinks of
[3:00:38] thothoflau: whats that thing on left side of ancestral guidance?
[3:00:40] mayfire15: I think they really like rls rn
[3:00:49] mnowpsn: Yeah for tourney he ranked u guys as #1
[3:00:52] chinchin23: @d0ncojones i think its crazy hard no matter what
[3:00:54] hipsterdufus: if verdant didn't move you, the class would be less fun, also it brings you in range to use your other low range heals
[3:00:54] SteLawBro: Everything but what cdew plays is the best healer.
[3:00:56] Raaein: Started a pres this season and it's the most fun i've had healing in a long time
[3:01:01] sanctusirl: @Solastro Those cc's can break or be dispelled.
[3:01:06] shredder1111: he rated u 9.5, highest on ur team
[3:01:10] admiraltegetthoff: any caster?
[3:01:19] Neji513: holy priest and mw best healers
[3:01:27] rekroyal: rmp best comp again?
[3:01:35] mnowpsn: Yeah Jah rated every awc player on NA u were 1 of highest
[3:01:37] ionlyplaymetas: verdant should just give you 1 second freedom when used
[3:01:41] chinchin23: @shredder1111 was that related to
[3:01:41] BigHawkWoW: Outlaw rogue is the easiest class in the game
[3:01:43] FKNweebstv: verdent needs to break roots
[3:01:47] mnowpsn: And ur team as #1
[3:01:54] Kymagez: clonecity bitch
[3:01:59] shredder1111: @chinchin23 he just rated all the awc players
[3:02:08] polkaroo: Echo team verdant yourself but stuck using extra global everytime

[3:03:13] FKNweebstv: 12
[3:03:14] Solastro: dh is prolly easiest
[3:03:15] Swishinn: outlaw is actually fairly difficult to play
[3:03:16] mnowpsn: Maybe basic outlaw is but as high skill ceiling
[3:03:17] bignoooodle: 9
[3:03:17] Kymagez: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHeWDQL6Brc PepePls
[3:03:24] FoxiekittenWoW: I’ve heard it’s pretty hard to play outlaw, that doesn’t mean they are not strong
[3:03:24] Swishinn: im a hunter main, trust me guys, bm hunter is the easiest
[3:03:27] chinchin23: i'm 35
[3:03:36] scottbur13: Taylorswift playing on ReckfulRerun <3

[5:49:12] DommyJB: @cdewx what time is the tourney tomorrow? and is it on youtube or your channel?
[5:49:19] iggy_pls: cata was fun but I already played it tbh
[5:49:27] Cocoapuffs1: and its only 1 patch
[5:49:27] Bierce_IV: ^
[5:49:40] Bierce_IV: Mop tho, that i would be more excited for
[5:50:06] Pushingdownthemid: @cdewx what is your confidence going into tomorrow?
[5:50:07] Talbadar: was cata where shaman dispel healed and had no cooldown
[5:50:11] Knaxxis: im on a nasty retail grind as well rn loving  it - doing pve and disc  priest for the first time
[5:50:17] humbling_farmer: 1 raiders from humbling_farmer have joined! 
[5:50:17] LocoPollo1: I am just waiting for the new retail expansion
[5:50:18] Bigpenance: mop was the best pvp imo
[5:50:21] yimoxq: @Talbadar yes. tho the heal had a 6sec cd or something
[5:50:33] Zartirian: cata is mainly pvp gear until last season, healer uses darkmoon card all expansion
[5:50:39] Tegredy999: honor gear is perfect
[5:50:43] Tegredy999: so easy to get
[5:50:46] argalanmg: super ez
[5:50:47] beepediboop: it's a grind, but less than wotlk
[5:50:48] Tegredy999: I loved that about it
[5:50:50] Tegredy999: yes
[5:50:56] Talbadar: darkmoon card volcano was really strong for dps
[5:50:59] TheEyeVII: isn't there bis pve pieces in cata as well
[5:50:59] Tegredy999: so much less than Woltk
[5:51:02] argalanmg: yeah ez to get
[5:51:11] JustApples_: Not gunna lie, Trying to gear or level in classic is such a turn off; I would love to have a 80 sham lol
[5:51:13] ajmiller7: @cdewx I totally agree, I also totally get that you’re enjoying your retail grind which is awesome!! I’ve been having a good time in retail right now too actually as resto druid. CATA gear was easy, and they also have RBGs which were awesome in CATA
[5:51:18] Talbadar: cunning of the cruel
[5:51:24] iggy_pls: dragon soul weapons in pvp KEKW
[5:51:28] Talbadar: vial rogue trinket :(
[5:51:30] 00ZZEE: @cdewx there is a lot of talk in EU about MMR being the biggest problem with DF, do you agree?
[5:51:34] Knaxxis: im fuckin lovin retail rn
[5:51:53] frozoneee: Baj gonna relive his Get Shit On days with Dragon Soul lol
[5:51:57] Bean: whatsup charles
[5:52:00] oogaboogabuu: !followage
[5:52:00] Moobot: @oogaboogabuu oogaboogabuu's been asking Cdew to use hex for 8y 8mo OSFrog
[5:52:02] Knaxxis: coming from ayear on classic it feels so fluid and smooth and fresh and challenging
[5:52:06] Zartirian: DF added great gearing, but killed the game with shuffle and no mmr :(
[5:52:07] murasuo: @Bean R U STILL VEGAN
[5:52:08] TheEyeVII: if you're not playing retail rn idk why you're playing wow tbh, sod phase 2 is gonna last a month then back to retail TwitchConHYPE
[5:52:22] moldybread00: did u say that u like pres better than rsham for this comp a little while ago lol
[5:52:23] argalanmg: i’d say cata is the peak of raid gear affecting pvp though
[5:52:27] argalanmg: kinda a downside
[5:52:29] murasuo: Cdew bean told me hes vegan
[5:52:35] Bless94j: 4.3.4 was fun
[5:52:41] Topher45: honestly idk why people shit on shuffle so much.  it’s so nice to be able to just log in and queue without needing teammates or to lfg
[5:53:20] Knaxxis: lol theyre not for u buddy
[5:53:25] JustApples_: Tbh Warrior or ret for dragonsoul would be great tbh because I never got to really experience that but honestly classic cata seems like a big overtaking lol
[5:53:38] TheEyeVII: @Topher45 it's awful tbh, they should remove all rewards for it aside for the legend pennant if they keep it
[5:54:07] thrashies: if they fix gdkp and sold runs being the norm maybe cata classic can be good, but not better than current retail imo at least for pve which is what i do nowadays

[6:02:19] markaimfire_: What a win!
[6:02:22] ajmiller7: @cdewx rbgs in CATA were just nice to mix up the monotony and get away from raiding and arenas for a little bit. —— for AWC I heard you didn’t really practice resto druid as much, is that just because you weren’t feeling the resto druid for your comps? or do the other healers your going to play offer something more?
