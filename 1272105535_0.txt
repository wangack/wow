[1:18:16] Aquadriel: @Towelliee reality is even 90% of MYTHIC raiders wont be prolly even halfway into the raid before the lgo is available

[1:19:13] arttemm123: yeah but then reclearing will become frustrating bro

[1:21:06] ClipCraft: SOD was 7
[1:21:19] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i meant kiljaeden fml
[1:21:42] Korupcija_: hard nerfs the raid, yet people still kill sylvanas after 300 pulls with full gear, conduits etc KEKW
[1:21:53] Allexi88: If its tuned for 2 leggo's its fine, but if its not, then I think its a issue.
[1:22:03] Wcvechten: I just hope those last 3 fights are tested reallly good internally
[1:22:11] Aquadriel: @Towelliee people talk about being challenging or not but at the end of the day a large number of people cant even beat AoTC
[1:22:15] Yagr6: what is the disaster scenario?
[1:22:22] lithium364: the wall will be the massive bugs on the last 3 Kappa
[1:22:26] Pippinn: @Towelliee EP was exactly 14days
[1:22:35] Odinslayer: i think anduin will be the wall
[1:22:50] Sollice: @Towelliee Check Discord when you have a second
[1:23:14] realnzall: !ui
[1:23:15] Moobot: @realnzall TBC UI: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25206-TowellieesTBCClassicElvUICompilation169.html |SL UI: wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK. Check !Discord's pinned messages in the #cesspool channel for further installation details. Dont forget to make backups!
[1:23:18] Aquadriel: from what i understood, you STILL need revered for alts.
[1:23:21] xo_navi: WoW needs tons of QoL improvements
[1:23:21] KaisenSiru: ontyTif
[1:23:25] Funderik: yeah like i keep saying blizzard are damned no matter what they do or change.
[1:23:27] Odinslayer: they now complain about the raid tuning KEKW
[1:23:29] reffan: by gating the leggos, couldn't they just gate boes and gear trading and eliminate split runs too?
[1:23:33] flebbooo: I swear people are so lazy today in wow KEKW
[1:23:37] Thunder4o: People want BiS items in mail asap so they can go on forums and whine there is no content after that
[1:23:37] DeanoTV: ye its acc wide
[1:23:38] mavericks312: these ppl want that shit handed to them the minute they log in
[1:23:38] sneakydudezz: I just got Abyss Worm 10 mins ago haha
[1:23:41] lumaday: account wide
[1:23:42] Pippinn: @Towelliee EP was 14 days, the nighthold was 17 days
[1:23:52] pheezr_: Play the game = rewards
[1:23:53] Aquadriel: i see a lot of people saying the revered bit, so i am still a bit confused
[1:23:54] Thoreya: It is account wide
[1:24:04] xo_navi: mythic raids should be easier, the amount of bullshit just to get to a boss after a wipe is silly
[1:24:10] Odinslayer: naguura's tweet tilted the shit out of me
[1:24:12] realnzall: @Towelliee The recipe is account wide, BUT it still needs revered AND the full campaign. It's only the belt item that needs the full campaign
[1:24:18] FranciscoTheMage: Im glad for the change.  if it fucks over the 1 percent
[1:24:19] Sollice: No rarity is an addon I believe
[1:24:20] Virus2508: @AugustItokai what? no....
[1:24:26] xo_navi: @Virus2508 yes
[1:24:28] happybooger: correct
[1:24:28] Aquadriel: is the recipe i think
[1:24:32] xo_navi: Nobody wants mythic KJ every tier
[1:24:33] arttemm123: august what are u talking about
[1:24:35] Kinghorn: to be able to craft them
[1:24:47] xPilsn: AugustItokai just dont wipe
[1:24:50] Virus2508: @AugustItokai stick to hc then if that content is more suited to your skills
[1:24:51] xo_navi: I am talking about mythic raiding, i have killed mythic end bosses, it is too hard for the vast majority of the players even post nerf
[1:24:53] Aquadriel: thats so confusing
[1:25:03] xo_navi: @Virus2508 lol great argument idiot
[1:25:15] jaydavidsen: So revered is just if you want covenant leggo on something other than your belt?
[1:25:17] arttemm123: august thats terrible way of seeing stuff
[1:25:22] Wheeellz: the belt does not have a socket and does not upgrade its ilvl 265
[1:25:22] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Microsoft Bought Blizzard!? My Reaction and what it means for WoW youtu.be/ZbvkJ2zFAZM
[1:25:26] Sollice: @AugustItokai Yeah no personal attacks you two can take it to tells. It's too early in the morning for that
[1:25:33] LittleLunarboy: Exactly what to do need revered for? If you get the memory from chapter 7?
[1:25:34] bumpstock75: SO make a lego to destroy to make lego you want later
[1:25:35] xo_navi: @Sollice ?? did you not see what he said
[1:25:36] arttemm123: i would quit wow if mythic raiding was easier , i find it easy enough as it is
[1:25:48] Sollice: Did you read what I said? you TWO can take it to tells
[1:26:14] Aquadriel: arttemm123 are you naowh? gigachad
[1:26:21] reffan: link armory
[1:26:21] Kinghorn: Limit arttemm123
[1:26:22] Sollice: @Towelliee Check Discord when you have a second
[1:26:25] Spaede: He’s 5/10m
[1:26:36] Funderik: that chatter was an disgruntled ex dev that has cleared all the raids
[1:26:49] xo_navi: It isn't just the raids themselves
[1:26:51] xo_navi: it's the trash and walk back
[1:26:54] xo_navi: and the gearing process
[1:27:03] arttemm123: what walk back ?
[1:27:06] xo_navi: it all convolutes raiding into a grindfest mess
[1:27:13] DaKevin10: Ordered my first mmo mouse today. Excited to try it out. Moving on from the death adder
[1:27:21] Sollice: @DaKevin10 What did you get?
[1:27:24] sneakydudezz: @Towelliee I just got the abyss worm like 15 mins ago, after 106 tries LUL
[1:27:26] Holysal: @AugustItokai FF14 does all that. seems perfect for you imo
[1:27:42] FranciscoTheMage: OR they have lives
[1:27:46] neomonstr: Mythic raiding is easy when you join a guild that already farms the content and you just tag along LUL
[1:27:48] volkov_lol: Mythic Raiding is not fun
[1:27:52] arttemm123: not even flexing like i love prog and my guild isnt the best in the world but we clear in 2 months on a 3 day scedual
[1:27:53] popaul2533: i many try for mistress
[1:28:03] Kinghorn: or they are alliance
[1:28:05] Wcvechten: I work world of warcraft
[1:28:14] meijer32: whats your favourite allied race?
[1:28:31] cahoots82: I struggle to fit in 6 hours/week for raiding. I'm older, have a wife/kid... I couldn't imagine doing more unless I had less RL responsibilities
[1:28:53] stokes_t: should i level my rogue or warrior alt
[1:28:56] xo_navi: Just make mythic KJ again and people will cry for raid's being easier
[1:28:58] JackHealMe: Man I dream of them balancing alliance and horde
[1:29:02] ClipCraft: my guild is rank 250 US but only 2 night guild
[1:29:03] Korupcija_: asmongold has the title KEKW
[1:29:12] DaKevin10: @Sallice Lol I wasn’t sure if I should get the Logitech g600 or razer naga. Thought the naga would be an easier transition from the death adder
[1:29:24] newkingcody: MOUNT TIME
[1:29:31] Bartholomew_521: @Korupcija_ his chat got it for him does it count? KEKW
[1:29:32] ClipCraft: ok this is the mount right here
[1:29:49] Sollice: @DaKevin10 Yeah it probably would. I like my G502 though it has 14 buttons in normaly mouse places. My hands too small for those side buttons
[1:30:19] arttemm123: so do you agree that the difficulty is just fine and it shouldnt. be easier to get CE ?
[1:30:31] motorboatingpro: i'm a little weirded out seeing you play ret
[1:30:42] ClipCraft: peepoSad
[1:30:55] ticma94: Ret is the true paladin specc
[1:30:55] TheGaoSora: imagine those who aren't as fortunate to get TLPD
[1:31:07] Groullock: @Towelliee Do you think they will announce the next expansion next week?
[1:31:11] FranciscoTheMage: who's max btw?
[1:31:19] ttmaker: @TheOmniSora tlpd isn't easy at all to get
[1:31:33] TheGaoSora: @ttmaker unless you're some sort of influencer
[1:31:37] toesniffjay: @Towelliee Don't feel bad towel im on 504 attempts for this mount. Rarity raises my blood pressure everytime i look @ it
[1:31:40] Hybridwarhawk: towStop towIt
[1:31:51] Kinghorn: towStop towIt
[1:31:52] lithium364: i hope its not just mobile game announcment
[1:31:54] Aquadriel: ala legion
[1:31:55] PattiFord: why would you next expansion before 9.2 is even out
[1:31:58] ttmaker: @Towelliee do you think we are getting 10.0 announcement next week ?
[1:31:58] xo_navi: The game promotes class stacking, RNG gear loot, and half the mechanics are tuned into an addon. They need to fix mythic raiding up a lot.
[1:31:59] Funderik: next week is too early
[1:32:00] jbmoongirl: Good morning all
[1:32:00] RiggsTorvak: its always more rewarding to get in there pre nerf
[1:32:05] lithium364: they will probably announce an WoW Stream or somethig thats scheduled for march
[1:32:08] KinggKebab: I'd expect a 9.2 announcement before 10.0 announcement
[1:32:10] Dkgungo: depends how desperate they feel
[1:32:13] Odinslayer: i thnk next week is gonna be a 9.2 release date and s2 end date
[1:32:13] Funderik: it will be after the last wing of lfr is open
[1:32:25] Groullock: Well Mike said he said they are going to announce things next week.
[1:32:25] superleonidka: 9.2 will be last patch of this expansion, is that confirmed?
[1:32:27] deckardblade: peoepl are gonna lose their shit (wrongly so)
[1:32:28] FranciscoTheMage: seriously i dont keep up with the names. is it the guy who does interviews about raid encounters? the only one i know is ion
[1:32:32] Jokervenom1978: I'll play WoW mobile games if they are good
[1:32:40] Icyroark: if their good who cares
[1:32:46] flebbooo: They have talked about making wow mobile games for atleast 4-5 years now LUL

[1:33:04] Odinslayer: i mean if the mobile games are good people will play it 100%
[1:33:05] Kinghorn: EZ
[1:33:10] galifax2: there are some people who absolutely hate every mobile game
[1:33:11] TheGaoSora: Excited about what?
[1:33:12] crotool: oh nice :D
[1:33:17] Wcvechten: will you also include 10.0 in that ranking? Kappa
[1:33:31] SaDos: @galifax2 I hate every mobile game
[1:33:32] superleonidka: is that true that 9.2 is the last path of shadowlands?
[1:33:37] superleonidka: patch
[1:33:37] lumaday: I love that your old UI videos from cata are still on there. that took me back!
[1:33:39] Korupcija_: another video PogChamp
[1:33:55] TheGaoSora: FALL BACK! coxRee
[1:33:56] bertooso: what are the chances they revert the holy parading changes to wings?
[1:33:58] twistedstick1: towLets towGo towPog
[1:34:04] mavericks312: the mobile games have to be good though cause it's a crowded field now
[1:34:12] moonscryer: Cataclysm had interesting raids except for DS. I'll be honest I thought BoT has great variety of bosses.
[1:34:31] toesniffjay: I remember back in the day when towel did subsundays and played SCP and games like that, man literally raised me in my youth basically
[1:34:32] RiggsTorvak: now every expansion will get 2 patch
[1:34:42] TheGiant99: KING HENRY back today and starting
[1:34:50] sean85214: Thought cata was a good exp but then again it really when I started playing
[1:35:03] realnzall: @Towelliee Is the !ui command fully updated? As in is that still the way to install your UI?
[1:35:10] salsaboyirl: yo yo! random question but fav paly mog??
[1:35:13] twistedstick1: Do you have a phone? Who needs a phone when you have blue stacks.
[1:35:24] deckardblade: @towelliee you know whats going to happen is asmongold will shit on the mobile games and it's a wrap
[1:35:33] inj0shwetrust: This year google play is making a pc app
[1:35:39] Sollice: If Blizzard is smart they will do a DI PC client like Raid
[1:35:42] PattiFord: I hope Google will speed up that "Google Play Games" thing, beta now starts in Asia
[1:35:47] inj0shwetrust: So many mobile games you wont actually need an emulator for
[1:35:57] Aravarth: @deckardblade I mean, you vastly overestimate his influence in China, where most people play on Mobile. Diablo Immortal wasn't targeted for a Western audience.
[1:36:14] Sollice: @inj0shwetrust Yeah thats right. In Windows 11 they are making it so you can play Android Apps natively on pc
[1:36:14] deckardblade: talking abotu wow not diablo
[1:36:17] swanny85: Good morning

[1:36:54] FranciscoTheMage: what a joke
[1:36:57] ClipCraft: he tries
[1:37:02] mavericks312: yea China could give fuck all about what he says
[1:37:04] Armdel: you know what he doesn't dictate? what you think is fun
[1:37:12] Kinghorn: the guy hiding on an alt channel?
[1:37:21] geokouts: mobile games on PC for Windows will maybe start next year. It is in beta in 3 Asian countries
[1:37:25] OnyxBere: We can play the the old raids now
[1:37:28] wester19: Did you get gul dan miunt ?
[1:37:29] Aquadriel: i can see asmongolds reaction alreadt: COCK ASS!
[1:37:30] swanny85: Is this new mobile game... Massively multiplayer?
[1:37:31] xo_navi: casual people love mobile games they can pay to win in
[1:37:31] twistedstick1: Asmon doesn't make or break a game.
[1:37:35] Icyroark: dont you have phones?
[1:37:40] JackHealMe: He's got the green lit script ready
[1:38:07] Aravarth: I mean, to be fair Asmon is largely the reason FFIV exploded recently
[1:38:08] swanny85: Mount farming on the toilet.

[1:38:18] Tausgi: but he already said that wow should have mobile game. sommething like companion app from legion
[1:38:18] geokouts: Warcraft Crush Saga!!!
[1:38:21] xo_navi: People gain some ego by being "good" at games whether its mythic raiding or pay 2 win. P2Win just easier.
[1:38:24] Alepouditsa: there is bluestacks i use to play mobile games on my pc
[1:38:25] PrimalRain: Aravarth was he though?
[1:38:25] Smurflord: Subsystem for Android

[1:38:51] xo_navi: honestly candy crush is fine as long as you aren't dumping money into it
[1:38:54] twistedstick1: Candy Crush the new mine sweeper.
[1:38:59] xo_navi: I knew a guy who spent thousands on it like how
[1:39:04] Smurflord: Candy Crush has been shipping with Windows 10 since 2015....
[1:39:20] Aravarth: @PrimalRain I think so, but in the sense he was the catalyst for getting people in who were considering it. Like he was the tipping point to get people in. But they were interested to play all ready, and just hadn't taken the plunge.
[1:39:25] Armdel: especially not one from the west
[1:39:33] Orthobullet: GINAHHH
[1:39:39] TheGaoSora: Addicts in general
[1:39:39] mavericks312: look at the dbz games alone Asia eats that shit up

[1:39:41] ptcapitao: Brasil
[1:39:44] druidiful: the only mobile game i play is sudoku
[1:39:52] xo_navi: I think we underestimate how bored people are and how much money they are willing to spend on dumb shit
[1:39:56] FranciscoTheMage: which sucked
[1:40:05] mrniceguy817: Always been curious where do ppl play mobile games since it’s so huge are ppl just at home on their phone instead of a console/pc
[1:40:10] notdustinx: i liked it... :/
[1:40:11] pixxelina: I liked it a lot
[1:40:22] eyeztea: not north America or eu, must be africa then

[1:40:35] PrimalRain: Aravarth that's fair for some people. think for many it was just timing with wow not being in a good spot so they finally moved over. glad it's popping off though
[1:40:38] xo_navi: Sub fee for mobile games you've made a million dollar idea
[1:40:38] TheGaoSora: pay factor isn't always gacha
[1:40:50] Aquadriel: @Towelliee people go into mobile games expecting them to be like a PC game... that's why they get mad when they see how it is lol
[1:40:54] Thovarisk: ppl ACT surprised by it
[1:40:55] xo_navi: what you do is have the sub fee AND a cash shop
[1:40:57] Thovarisk: very different
[1:40:59] mavericks312: the gachabpart is more rng paying then just p2w
[1:41:05] darkh79: people aren't surprised -they just like to complain about everything

[1:41:37] Aquadriel: yeah but those people's opinions are irrelevant LUL
[1:41:41] xo_navi: It's just the trend in gaming for it to go towards cash grabs vs actual gameplay. But people support it so what can you do.
[1:41:42] inj0shwetrust: Youre right though
[1:41:45] happybooger: 100% thats what we will hear

[1:42:01] naturespimp: good morning hows the farm going
[1:42:02] KinggKebab: You think it'll be a mobile games announcement rather than a 9.2 announcement?
[1:42:02] twistedstick1: I can't wait to hear Asmon bitch about the pay store for Diablo Immoral.
[1:42:03] Aquadriel: prety sure wow mobile team is not as big as Immortal was/is
[1:42:08] inj0shwetrust: No im saying youre right about the community reaction
[1:42:11] bumpstock75: Its always fun getting group with player that don;t speak English. lol
[1:42:18] mavericks312: the mobile games could possibly double or triple what wow makes though
[1:42:27] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what are the real prospects for the WoW token to continue. it does provide revenue doesnt it?
[1:42:28] motorboatingpro: so long as we can do pet battles while on the throne, it'll be fine
[1:42:31] ItsXolten: 400 attempts how tf is that possible LUL

[1:59:37] mytherel: you think you wanted him to visit the stream but you dont

[1:59:41] notdustinx: Mike is always in max stream

[2:05:25] Aquadriel: of mythic LUL
[2:05:27] Thdlock: the fight was bugged so if any1 was downstairs and u got 100 energy

[2:06:22] z01z: i have zero faith the last 4 bosses wont be a shitshow without testing them

[5:00:31] Noshpan: With all of the behind-the-scenes, pre-production & post-production stuff streamers have to do, calling them wizards is pretty accurate.

[5:12:20] roronoa929: no warlock :|
[5:12:35] Everbliss: I bet not many people care about 9.2 once Lost Ark comes out
[5:12:48] sean85214: @cybermyst I know the feeling between that and need a new laptop or pc cause my laptop atm can’t support shadowlands 🤣🤣🤣
[5:13:07] Neviriah: @Rulem omg same. thats the best thing ever LUL
[5:13:08] zeitgeiz: As someone that took a break from wow, could you make a video for returning players? @towelliee liking your other YT content lately
[5:13:18] AureliusXV: lost ark has been out know one cares
[5:13:22] Everbliss: I think people will be so absorbed in Lost Ark that the 9.2 release will not matter is what I mean
[5:13:26] helperuwu3: yea but who is playing wow anymore kekw
[5:13:33] lithium364: so an guide on how to buy the right boost?

[5:13:58] zeitgeiz: @towelliee maybe a sell for coming back in 9.2.

[5:14:39] Creamyeee: Oh cool they added the Protoss to WoW finally
[5:14:47] CrusaderNero: ESO is my chillax console MMO
[5:14:49] lithium364: @Towelliee did you get all the heritage armor sets yet? maybe thats something to do before  9.2 aswell
[5:14:52] Eran_21: wow has always been intresting to watch

[5:19:44] dalaraz: 100% is going to 0 :p
[5:19:45] dracullatv: crypto is done
[5:19:47] DukeBaphomet: theyre trying to stop inflation
[5:19:51] UnProfessionalsLLC: its affecks World race less then anyone else playing the game
[5:19:57] xo_navi: I hope everyone who invested in crypto loses their money
[5:19:59] xo_navi: no lie
[5:20:01] Syprus1: that and i think its india who has condemened crypto
[5:20:06] gdtomii: @AugustItokai true KEKW
[5:20:07] Aidler: looming war is bad for crypto

[5:20:14] Rudric_Ice: crypto days are coming to an end
[5:20:16] UnProfessionalsLLC: mythic is week 3 right. so they will be on week 2 or 3 pulling boss and get their stuff. we are at week 5 until normal guilds get the power
[5:20:17] Merqury3: US inflation
[5:20:20] Dark_Kornax: they don't want a currency out of their control
[5:20:29] 24sevn: stimulus ran out :(
[5:20:35] Maxoru0: isn't China cracking down it too
[5:20:35] Oddbus: That is fucked up to say, you did something I don
[5:20:38] psukhedelon: honestly hope that 9.2 breathes some life into the game for me. played at Shadowlands release, got bored fariyl and have been happily no-lifing FFXIV since Endwalker dropped
[5:20:42] RavenorHS: Sometimes I get the hankering to come back to retail just so I can use my Corrupted Ashbringer for transmog

[5:21:14] arcaniia007: double legendary is acc wide ye?
[5:21:15] UnProfessionalsLLC: mythic doesnt release until week 2 of 9.2
[5:21:20] FredBawls: Do you think mm hunter will be good?
[5:21:31] UnProfessionalsLLC: so its LESS time for a mythic raid guild until they get the buff to assist them
[5:21:33] crushlemons: Does it mean affordable GPU'S again @towelliee ??
[5:21:36] vanellion94: is this raid map like nyalotha traversal where you mount up and run pretty far to the different bosses
[5:21:47] UnProfessionalsLLC: ok so even less weeks until mythic gets help to clear.   World first got a benny from the time adjustment
[5:22:06] dalaraz: doubt any wow race ho past 3 weeks like ever
[5:22:37] zeitgeiz: I hate that they can’t play with two leggos, but it isn’t too big a deal for most. Just worry about the tuning.
[5:22:38] herraticc: 12 days is the most
[5:22:44] Thoreya: kinda sucks
[5:22:47] AureliusXV: no one cares what that guy thinks
[5:22:53] UnProfessionalsLLC: anyoen care the Blizz NErfed us start of 9.2.  They owed us player power to make up for shards. They shoulda gave us double week 1 of new zone
[5:23:02] Armdel: not even, more like 0.1%
[5:23:03] dalaraz: not 1% more like 100 person issue
[5:23:06] UnProfessionalsLLC: They ever NERF us in the middle of a patch in history?
[5:23:13] TheRealFaithLezz: !uptime
[5:23:19] Punk611: tuning will be wierd
[5:23:39] zeitgeiz: Think Blizz didn’t have time and manpower to test and tune around two leggos
[5:23:55] UnProfessionalsLLC: They are taking our Shards day one.  We will do less dps starting 9.2.  They nerfed us in the middle of a xpack. IT a new thing I guess thy are trying
[5:23:56] Aidler: if all in the race involved parties have only 1 lego there is nothing to complain
[5:24:02] antphilosophy: @Towelliee how much time until the big announcement?
[5:24:04] iblighters: well mythic will be super nerfed on week 5 when we get our second leggo
[5:24:21] Rulem: LOL
[5:24:22] theDirtyon3: LUL

[5:29:33] Ralykx: yeah 40
[5:29:34] Alvari: thoughts about the upcoming raid at this point?
[5:29:36] ribose1982: I am really excited for 9.2. Do you think it will be some good content with what you have experienced of it so far?
[5:30:04] dracullus: leveling alone gives more playtime that many 60$ games
[5:30:17] arcaniia007: double legendary (chapter 7 unlock) is account wide?
[5:30:23] UnProfessionalsLLC: ya

[5:30:51] inj0shwetrust: I dont mind a new zone
[5:31:18] athuli2: Nope i like raiding not having another day job at korthia
[5:31:22] inj0shwetrust: Im at a point in Korhia where I just need Archivists Paragon Box mount and ive got everything else
[5:31:55] EdgyMemeBear: @inj0shwetrust Same, it's so boring but I just need one mount LUL
[5:32:26] inj0shwetrust: I just do the dailies with the big rep and kill what I come across while there
[5:32:40] theDirtyon3: i just need reliwik or however you spell it and im done
[5:32:41] inj0shwetrust: and loot any shrooms or chests along the way too
[5:32:55] dracullus: @arcaniia007 I don't think so, for finishing campaign you just get belt that could be used as second legendary, but for revered you get account wide memory and you can craft it on any character (probably any slot too, but im not sure)
[5:33:08] EdgyMemeBear: Yeah, that's what I usually do. Doesn't take too long to get a paragon box with codex imo
[5:33:28] athuli2: You are forced to grind zone anyway for conduits
[5:34:06] dracullus: there will be 226 token
[5:34:10] dracullus: account wide
[5:34:14] Milanesa_De_Pollo: there is one
[5:34:22] dalaraz: aint there a full 272 but its after 2 months grind or somethng ? @Towelliee
[5:34:26] Milanesa_De_Pollo: there just isn't one to upgrade conduits to 256
[5:34:39] solsaver12: Good, I'm so behind.
[5:34:40] sifer007: 9,2 looks amazing
[5:35:00] zeitgeiz: Wish they would just have leggos drop at maybe 9.1 max level and THEN have us upgrade. The gold cost is nuts
[5:35:02] Kelmor: and fix honor
[5:35:12] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee maybe an 80 renown thing but only usable in covenants you've gotten 80 renown in.
[5:35:25] pixxelina: sweet
[5:35:49] swordart_19: @solsaver12 then play the game
[5:36:00] Aidler: maybe they reset anima Kappa
[5:36:00] arcaniia007: @dracullus  ye but if i want belt on all my tanks then i do 7/7 chapter 6 times if i dont wanna repfarm revered?
[5:36:24] kyr_slowbro: I guess that's why the wow token is in the game, for leggo pieces
[5:36:33] solsaver12: I'll wait to play retail @swordart_19
[5:36:39] swordart_19: @cr3de exactly
[5:36:43] TheGiant99: so lots of good catch up stuff
[5:36:52] Maxoru0: that's good
[5:37:21] dracullus: @arcaniia007 I think so, but it's so late anyway (5 weeks into patch) you better off just doing few dailies instead same campaign 6 times
[5:37:35] dalaraz: theres an item in exalted with the new rep at zereth  that teaches you all conduits and takes em to 272  @Towelliee
[5:37:52] zeitgeiz: Crazy that I can level 50-60 on an alt and be ahead of a friend coming back from 9.0 trying to catch up renown lol
[5:37:55] inj0shwetrust: I just levelled a mage and sent it like 15 crates of valor gear lol
[5:38:02] gdtomii: @dalaraz it requires Cutting Edge/M+hero/Glad too
[5:38:03] sifer007: agaon blizzard throwing epics at the players
[5:38:15] roronoa929: yup
[5:38:21] inj0shwetrust: My hunter literally cant get anything esle from keys or M+
[5:38:22] NuAera: League Poggers :)
[5:38:24] Sacura_Shadow: damn straight lol
[5:38:30] swordart_19: returnig players have no value.
[5:38:33] dalaraz: @dalaraz yeah hero is fairly ok
[5:38:42] xo_navi: they always do that tho
[5:38:47] Thasin22: Yea only reason why ff was so popular was because the wow players had like YEARS of content to do.
[5:38:51] TheGiant99: why do people hjave such a issue with others getting epics
[5:38:52] theDirtyon3: its about to be a new patch...best time to grind all your alts
[5:39:12] assman_ny: All new fun stuff
[5:39:17] Snomase: @Towelliee Just got here, what epics are you talking about?
[5:39:23] dracullus: oh yeah, scrap catch ups, let's repeat huge TBC success with bringing people back
[5:39:27] swordart_19: @TheGiant99 cause they paly multiplayer game no one casres if it was singleplayer.
[5:39:29] solsaver12: When is patch 9.2?
[5:39:41] xo_navi: i think i know what you mean like 8.2 with azerite / nazjatar stuff
[5:39:45] pattar101: pattar101 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:39:47] TheGiant99: @swordart_19 but them getting those epics effects you zero
[5:39:48] Snomase: Rewind would be awesome
[5:39:56] Mattven: need to start all this at the start of the exp imo
[5:39:58] swordart_19: @TheGiant99 then you are clueless lul
[5:40:02] Aidler: 9.2 is a good patch in the tradition of past x.2 patches
[5:40:03] Crimsonbarentain: bro i want that mount
[5:40:03] Shifty_CZ: IM SO ANGY ovdRage
[5:40:20] solsaver12: lol
[5:40:22] legendarydarkstar: ashes of alar is the greatest mount
[5:40:23] xo_navi: one huge thing for me is flight path LUL
[5:40:26] Cafe0le: for alts
[5:40:27] TheItalianStallion321: what a dumb comment
[5:40:27] inj0shwetrust: you got a point lol
[5:40:28] swordart_19: SOme of you should play some pay to win mobile games
[5:40:31] dracullus: some people confuse catch up with giving you all stuff from current tier
[5:40:33] swordart_19: just swipe and be done on day one
[5:40:35] TheGiant99: @swordart_19 hoiw does them getting the epics effect yoo
[5:40:43] dalaraz: i think he is talking about alts @Towelliee
[5:40:44] Thasin22: he's a swiper
[5:40:45] sifer007: why should everybody catch up?
[5:40:47] heresjerome: is this expansion worth it iyo?
[5:40:49] kyr_slowbro: They can definitely improve things for alts at the start of the expansion, as far as the quest stuff and those things
[5:40:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: More account-wide is a good idea
[5:40:59] jacooners: but it wasnt alt friendly
[5:41:02] Broomba: getting catch up gear at beginning of expansion - putting cart before horse -- makes no sense @towelliee
[5:41:07] Armdel: gearing up is a time gate. they should just give us a vendo at the start of every patch
[5:41:11] solsaver12: agree @weirdo_dude
[5:41:19] kyr_slowbro: Grinding at the start of the expansion is fun
[5:41:25] Anbean: any news on when 9.2 going live?
[5:41:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: I can't even send my soul cinders to an alt, and the box of many things is per character....annoying
[5:41:34] kyr_slowbro: that's when the gear grind is real
[5:41:39] TheGiant99: Rep should be account wide
[5:41:48] gdtomii: Why dont they just have a vendor to buy mythic gear from the start salvdaPoog
[5:41:49] xo_navi: Does anyone actually want flight path to be time gated for a year every time?
[5:41:51] All_American25: lol @Towelliee that's me on the green bird. saw your name and was like no way
[5:41:52] Holb__: Hey all.  No luck w Wartusk yet I see
[5:41:52] dracullus: one thing that should be account wide from start are expansion systems beyond gearing that were invented to give something to do people with 1 char
[5:42:03] legendarydarkstar: @Towelliee do you think microsoft owning blizzard is a good idea?
[5:42:17] floodedrolex: Do you play any tbc?

[5:43:19] tomcruise210: man that would be awesome if they did that
[5:43:21] moa285: Just say it.. Lifelands Kappa
[5:43:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: That would be fine with me, do all the stuff on one character and it becomes account-wide
[5:43:33] Kelticlore: I liked what they did with rep in MOP with the double rep account wide once you hit revered one 1 toon and bought the token
[5:43:36] Neviriah: honestly wonder what announcement you're on about. What's this limit thing?! xD
[5:43:37] edingt0n: I look forward to being OP in legacy content so I can solo legion raids in 5 minutes again

[5:44:10] Armdel: announcing they started a Limit org
[5:44:12] a23pk: finga popingggg
[5:44:13] xo_navi: funny enough, soda is one of the best pvp players ive ever seen
[5:44:15] dalaraz: why lifelands though,we aint even at deathlands
[5:44:21] dalaraz: it should be lightlands already
[5:44:26] Short_Film: What happened with complexity? thought they were a good fit
[5:44:41] PUBGesus1392: what will WoW look like in 20 yearsa
[5:44:44] xo_navi: or used to be at least
[5:44:50] ribose1982: Do you think Preach will return to wow?
[5:44:56] GermanBacon: called it yesterday, its gonna be Heinz Beans Limit NODDERS
[5:45:09] Tr1kk1: yup, give us the bfa path finder
[5:45:12] Theduskflyer: i wish they would just bring back the EXP bonus on heirlooms
[5:45:19] smashwow: So now we have someone that plays the game Kappa
[5:45:30] turboman604: dont have time to do the retail BS, hope they get rid of covenant, legendary quests and tourghast
[5:45:34] TheGiant99: @Towelliee that would be so good
[5:45:39] assman_ny: Mike had me when he put, LMAO in his announcement
[5:45:43] Neviriah: @GermanBacon loving your nickname neviri1Giggle
[5:45:51] cahoots82: @turboman604 Take all that away and what are you playing?
[5:45:52] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Ranking EVERY World Of Warcraft Expansion - WoW Tier List youtu.be/CLrPHWHnfEw
[5:45:59] Cabbageman007: The ads are evident today
[5:46:02] dracullus: I love exploration toys from 9.1.5, always wanted stuff like that
[5:46:12] jacooners: i like grinding when its fun. torghast and renown are not fun to me
[5:46:17] joontet: @dracullus What's that?
[5:46:17] dyslexican1: It would incurage people to actually do reps. i like that idea honestly.
[5:46:21] swordart_19: i hope a lot
[5:46:27] QcSolidRock: 14 has a really good system for secondary jobs
[5:46:33] Holb__: Even if they introduced the MoP rep increase but make it like 250% or 500% increase
[5:46:33] melh1989: catch up should be for systems in current expantion, Ilvl should be something that u need to work on
[5:46:37] Kelticlore: as long as we dont have any more systems Like we have had since Legion
[5:46:39] sifer007: no more systems
[5:46:43] Snomase: I really wish borrow powers would go away
[5:46:53] swordart_19: @sifer00 dont play game it is system on , operating system 4Head
[5:46:54] Dark_Kornax: The real issue, is that the time consumption on alts is far too much.
[5:46:58] swordart_19: that would be boring
[5:47:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Games need systems, they just need to be not annoying and respect players time
[5:47:04] xo_navi: this new thing, awesome power, or AP, a new thing its sick
[5:47:07] dracullus: @joontet on alt you click toy and get whole map explored + all flight maps, there is one toy for every continent including SL
[5:47:11] swordart_19: ResidentSleeper
[5:47:21] Alvari: how's the new raid turning out? can we expect a proper race to world first?
[5:47:33] Kelticlore: you mean all the systems they had in BFA was to much LOL
[5:47:40] TheGiant99: WoW with a bnattlepass would be LIT
[5:47:52] Cafe0le: if you have borrowed power at least make it like legion spec specific
[5:47:54] smashwow: We also need something that moves into the next xpac with the character progression though
[5:47:55] xo_navi: and worse systems
[5:47:59] xo_navi: tbh
[5:48:00] solsaver12: Get rid of these systems...way too many.
[5:48:04] swordart_19: soulbinds is like only thing
[5:48:05] turboman604: srsly
[5:48:07] xo_navi: although azerite was rough
[5:48:08] tomcruise210: i miss reaping flames  FeelsStrongMan
[5:48:08] swordart_19: @solsaver12 go play classic
[5:48:10] turboman604: just want to fucking BG
[5:48:14] swordart_19: sounds boring
[5:48:16] turboman604: dont want to fucking farm anything else
[5:48:19] Dufuslongsocks: lets just say legion was the best
[5:48:22] joontet: @dracullus Man that's cool. But why does it have to cost 10k though... :/
[5:48:25] turboman604: so sick of renown shit
[5:48:28] solsaver12: I do play Classic lol @swordart_19
[5:48:29] swordart_19: There is barely eny ggameplay depth in game lul
[5:48:33] TheGiant99: Lost Ark in KR and RU have a battlepass hope we get one in NA

[5:48:40] Literae: MOP Cloak
[5:48:43] Punk611: I hate long quest lines for legos
[5:48:48] turboman604: went to TBC because retail is criminal
[5:48:55] ShadowDMG6969: !lurk
[5:49:09] Bayne77: when everything is legendary, nothing is
[5:49:13] swordart_19: put these powers on gear EZ
[5:49:13] Holb__: We end up wielding the Dragon Soul maybe as our legendary item
[5:49:14] turboman604: remember when a legendary was an actual accomplishment
[5:49:18] swordart_19: GGive me PoE/Diablo loot EZ
[5:49:22] tomcruise210: classic leggos rip
[5:49:25] jacooners: thats why i like artifact weapons
[5:49:26] spainard15: Towelliee the ideal expansion in your thoughts as far as building a community for revery one to enjoy the game again. Would you say a Wrath or MOP style  expansion?!
[5:49:27] jerexify: @Towelliee Yes! The Legion legendary system was amazing.
[5:49:27] joontet: @bayne77 well said
[5:49:30] TheGaoSora: But what about the minmaxers? Kappa
[5:49:33] Dark_Kornax: Like MoP!
[5:49:34] Sylvia_Dream: you mean like legion weapon? or bfa heart?
[5:49:41] Literae: Ring and Cloak were the best style. Grew with patch before becoming lego
[5:49:43] Dark_Kornax: Mop Cloak
[5:49:48] jerexify: Sorry, artifact weapon, not regular legendary stuff.
[5:50:03] Holb__: search for malk too
[5:50:06] sifer007: meh classic legenderis wasthe real ones
[5:50:07] DevilSpire: Like dragonwrath?
[5:50:10] spainard15: I didnt even like the MOP cloak it kills alts
[5:50:10] tomcruise210: did you full swap horde?
[5:50:15] onous_: Whats next platinum?
[5:50:17] tomcruise210: or still have alli toons?
[5:50:19] TheGiant99: another classic ANDY
[5:50:22] Holb__: Malk is for Malkorak
[5:50:26] dracullus: to be honest without RNG current legendary system just fall apart, you craft bis one and forget about rest
[5:50:27] Literae: Announcement: "We are returning to WoW from FF" ResidentSleeper
[5:50:33] Armdel: Max starts the stream at 11 then stalls for another 15 minutes
[5:50:33] TheGaoSora: war... war never changes...
[5:50:46] jerexify: Ha! lol https://twitter.com/warcraftstats/status/1484941567299182596
[5:51:01] DeeterDo: would you battle pass + subscription? or just battle pass
[5:51:08] Punk611: I have to say, the drop chance for weapons really needs a little boost. It takes way to long to find weapons.
[5:51:18] jacooners: i agree with everything you said but hte battlepass
[5:51:25] spainard15: I think Legos from Wrath and Cata was the way to go. Where it becomes a long time invested ion the game
[5:51:25] swordart_19: ONly reason i play right now is to collect cosmetics from COvenants and such
[5:51:26] tomcruise210: im anxious to see what the future holds with microsoft
[5:51:27] Literae: SWTOR Conquest Season they did. Reward for logging in etc.
[5:51:37] motorboatingpro: Aspect Power -- AP   hehehe
[5:51:40] swordart_19: That i like
[5:51:42] jacooners: but if its cosmetic thats fine
[5:51:43] Pharaoh_326: @Towelliee party finder up
[5:51:49] TheGaoSora: So... daily login bonus?..
[5:51:49] omegaflash1: omegaflash1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[5:52:00] TheGiant99: @Towelliee paid or free
[5:52:01] tomcruise210: man wow tokens on the battle pass would be sicc
[5:52:05] xo_navi: If the game was as generous as that i wouldn't feel bad supporting it
[5:52:06] Funderik: yeah no thanks to battle pass
[5:52:07] onous_: what? wheres the fucking mount being offered?
[5:52:21] hideonreddit: should be paid
[5:52:23] swordart_19: @therealonous you get multiple mounts from renown and cosmetics
[5:52:26] WolfMan4500: i say only a wow token for the current season though
[5:52:26] hideonreddit: if wow token is reward
[5:52:34] onous_: kids need mounts
[5:52:42] dyslexican1: Sad, i sat in que for your group and no one invited.
[5:52:43] StreamElements: Use code POG-TOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorBot #ad
[5:52:51] maccaruso: @Towelliee What happened?  I thought you were going to be all about that TBC Classic life?
[5:53:05] Funderik: you will just be getting free sub every month with your idea, the wow token cost more then the sub, people would never have to pay again, bad idea
[5:53:10] jacooners: i agree with that for sure
[5:53:14] solsaver12: yup
[5:53:19] jacooners: as long as they dont charge for the pass
[5:53:31] xo_navi: min ilvl sync and stuff?
[5:53:32] TheGaoSora: as long as it isn't fomo induced sure BP could work
[5:53:33] hideonreddit: yeah the math with the token doesnt make sense
[5:53:37] Lumbdan: wow people still play wow?
[5:53:41] Moronil: My wish for FF is some form of M+ but I "think" it's coming
[5:53:42] onous_: Look im still waiting on Classic/vanilla time walkingm
[5:53:47] darkh79: just make timewalking up every week and rotate - and then have pvp quest up every week and rotate
[5:53:50] darkh79: double them up
[5:53:59] PUBGesus1392: what will WoW look like in 20 years?
[5:54:00] swordart_19: OMEGALUL
[5:54:21] swordart_19: I dont care for it , dont see myself doing it would be interesting
[5:54:30] Panflete: Without loss of generality, let us assume that all vegetables suddenly develop the capacity to dream. I then postulate that, in theory, if all vegetables could dream then cucumbers would dream the wickedest of dreams.
[5:54:35] dennis_menace88: still the same exept 20 more expansions xD
[5:54:37] Lumbdan: @PUBGesus1392 servers will be down by then bro
[5:54:41] Havenmess: Is bear or dh tank better?
[5:54:49] jacooners: i agree with that 100%
[5:54:49] zoovthepally: Get rid of lfr make old content drop lfr level gear?
[5:54:51] fullryuga: For that they need to cut trash out and make the mechanics clearer
[5:54:51] dennis_menace88: dont think servers ever will go down for wow
[5:54:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sounds good to me
[5:54:55] TheGaoSora: And bring back removed mounts and xmogs
[5:54:57] PUBGesus1392: @Lumbdan how do you know that?
[5:54:58] xo_navi: @Havenmess dh prob better, bear is good too tho whatever you prefer
[5:55:14] swordart_19: If they would come out and say instead we spend time to do /renew old stuff they get laughed at
[5:55:16] DarqStalker: that mount transisition is like Tera
[5:55:25] xo_navi: @Havenmess depends also if the group has a dh buff
[5:55:26] fullryuga: For the raids to be fun, you dont want to spend an hour on trash
[5:55:27] Joneeeez: I really hope you take towelliees advice now microsoft devs, its awesome
[5:55:30] xhaven: @zoovthepally they want to keep people playing not alienate 99% of the playerbase
[5:55:32] fullryuga: the old raids
[5:55:41] TheGaoSora: BMAH was a bad idea
[5:55:50] jacooners: i dont think so either making the old raids relevant makes so much more content fun
[5:55:54] xo_navi: titan forge WutFace
[5:55:55] swordart_19: true
[5:56:02] honkblarg: I miss titanforging
[5:56:12] Moronil: GOD FORGING PogChamp
[5:56:35] piratechris: Microsoft is here to milk Wow for all it is worth and make as much money as they can from it any way they can.
[5:56:39] TheGiant99: make it f2p and add a store and sells tuff :)
[5:56:39] woodchuck91: why would they be laughed at for bringing more content to the game? Even if its old content its nothing bad with it at all
[5:56:40] TheGaoSora: Titan Forged WoW? danHmm
[5:56:47] fullryuga: For a grind they can just make a relic weapon grind like FF14 and just call them artifact weapons again
[5:56:54] xo_navi: 10.0 we're bringing back titan forging, and azerite armor
[5:56:54] ZansTeamCaptain: good for oil and money
[5:56:54] showmethesugar35: wow reforged
[5:56:56] Screamnsteam: so basically microsoft is the US and WoW is ukraine
[5:57:07] Lumbdan: 60 billion aquistion is fucking insane.. def think they over valued and paid 2 much
[5:57:08] DarqStalker: All I want is a Warthog mount in WoW and I'll resub lol
[5:57:17] xo_navi: ff14 gearing is so different anyway
[5:57:21] swordart_19: @DarqStalker get goblin trike be happy lul
[5:57:27] TheGaoSora: So is most everything in WoW though LUL
[5:57:33] Aegrial: @Lumbdan they are paying for all the IP, COD and Candy crush are worth that alone
[5:57:34] fullryuga: Better than grinding for flying
[5:57:37] Mazeltough: did i miss the limit announcement?
[5:57:56] mrniceguy817: In 10 mins I thinks
[5:57:57] DarqStalker: I hear Candy Crush is making more money than CoD
[5:58:10] jacooners: poe has that and its cool its just challenges and you get cool portals or armor and its totalyl optionally
[5:58:15] swordart_19: truee
[5:58:17] Serrion1321: Have you been normal raid already? ^^
[5:58:23] swordart_19: i love it lul
[5:58:25] QuigsTV: @Towelliee whats up hows it going?
[5:58:28] WundertueteGER: I love battlepass
