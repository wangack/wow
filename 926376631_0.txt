[0:58:01] KinggKebab: Corruption was fun, lets be real. It's just sustainable when it was as strong as it was
[0:58:09] Funderik: could be ideas for tier sets, using stuff from azerite and corruption gear
[0:58:13] NotWookiee: each piece of gear has an anima power
[0:58:33] KinggKebab: not sustainable*

[1:01:55] Funderik: this might sound crazy, however since the jailer can not just pull worlds/zones into the maw, the chances of him pulling a titan planet into the maw might be a thing (blizzard gave the idea of titan worlds)
[1:02:00] A_Klimas: no one does
[1:02:12] A_Klimas: ps5 isnt real
[1:02:40] pereadin: its the place between tthe maw and shadowlands

[1:07:44] A_Klimas: and players liked it
[1:07:47] reinhardtdog: Next expansion being the other side of Azeroth?
[1:08:15] Athaeln: Why would he care about Azeroth?
[1:08:19] TheUnknowing: I wouldnt be surprised if the jailer turns out to be a multi expac boss
[1:08:22] A_Klimas: we saw the chains on the broker world
[1:08:35] chrslp: 3 xpacs from now the jailer will be our friend
[1:08:37] A_Klimas: hes gonna do that to the shadowlands
[1:08:42] niebvelungen: @chrslp KEKW
[1:08:45] pereadin: You think tthey'll give sylvanas the 3% HP redemption arc?
[1:08:52] Xannah08: that would go with him being the world sould Sargeras killed to
[1:09:31] dracullatv: Sargeras will grab his sword and slice Jailers head off and then Azeroth will wake up and kill Sargeras LUL

[1:11:12] br0therbrian: the shamelessness with which they went full lich king 2.0 was kinda yikes
[1:11:16] TheOGDaywalker: if they made him full blown corruption id be upset
[1:11:25] MasterworkLive: arthas coming back snipes the power back
[1:11:27] pereadin: KEKW
[1:11:30] MasterworkLive: maybe
[1:11:36] br0therbrian: The only true winner is my boy apexis crystals
[1:11:38] Funderik: the cinematic where sargeras summons argus, argus says to the titans "that which you have stolen, will be your undoing" there's been some SL setup for awhile :P
[1:11:41] Strifelol: Varian will set him free :)
[1:11:47] A_Klimas: not the players thats for fuckin sure
[1:11:50] ZenigadeTV: KEKW

[1:12:05] Blistz1: BFA BABY ALL THE WAY. Where is my boy MAGNI
[1:12:27] reinhardtdog: Hmm I wonder who crafted Sargaras sword
[1:12:43] IIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIII: Late Towel stream
[1:12:58] Blistz1: @reinhardtdog he crafted it lol
[1:12:59] Funderik: great question, i'm unsure if anyone knows YET
[1:13:06] Blistz1: @reinhardtdog you can see it in the cinamatic Legion
[1:13:13] dracullatv: Yeah in 9.3 we will use Heart of Azeroth again to farm Azerite. And we will farm Azerite and Anima at the same time and then combine it to unlock new abilities LUL
[1:13:16] TheUnknowing: 9.3 back to azeroth, COLLECT AZERITE ALL OVER AGAIN, NEW ESSENCES, CORRUPTIONS BACK! Kappa
[1:13:16] dracullatv: ultimate plan
[1:13:23] br0therbrian: its all a simulation
[1:13:40] PadidinJones: @Towelliee that theory is invalid because the heart of azeroth is not provided until lvl 50 now and is not required
[1:13:42] Sadisticmedic: PogU
[1:13:45] Funderik: domination gear in 9.3 :P
[1:13:47] MasterworkLive: can the old gods travel through the realms?
[1:13:49] Sadisticmedic: PogChamp
[1:13:58] reinhardtdog: @Blistz1 Oh I guess I had forgotten
[1:14:00] IIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIII: The jailer is just the game dev
[1:14:13] br0therbrian: expert coder bros mr jailer and mr denathrius
[1:14:18] Chris_127: hydra created covid smh
[1:14:24] Shatraugh: Inside job by blizzard Kappa
[1:14:38] IIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIII: general ai jailer
[1:14:44] Blistz1: void
[1:14:48] Blistz1: ya
[1:14:50] Wackhaus: So funny Im already working (it's morning here), and it's not even February 25th at your place haha
[1:14:59] Wackhaus: 24th scuse me
[1:15:04] Hitokiri83: its the void can enter the shadows lands i dont see why not
[1:15:13] MasterworkLive: I just meant if they get fucked off to one of the covenants if they could be super powered again like hakkar
[1:15:25] br0therbrian: so like if we made a tier hierachy with the titans on top then are the void lords the anti-titans? Is the jailer the leader of the void?
[1:15:29] bigmoneymaverick: Do we know when tbc is being released?
[1:15:31] Blistz1: Okay who created the titans then? First ones? It explains why they keep saying eternal ones and titans are related
[1:15:37] Chajuseek: What do u think about Brewmaster in 9.1 after nerfed dh veg he ll be on top ?
[1:15:37] br0therbrian: Are the titans the boss of the shadowlands
[1:15:53] Funderik: i'm not so sure the old gods are void, the titans seemed to want to hide things from the shadowlands, could be a cover up, chronicles can't be trusted.

[1:18:51] draxxam: I remember all the CD-R sales back in the days at Fry's. lol
[1:18:51] Funderik: the shadowlands book coming later this year, will shake up peoples opinions i think, chronicles is basically titan propaganda.
[1:19:05] MrGrimms: wait what did I miss, whats closing?
[1:19:08] br0therbrian: i feel like towelliee moved to california to be with lula but i have no idea

[1:20:51] chrslp: Best Buy has been busy af every time I've gone during this pandemic
[1:20:54] dutchie76: Best Buy stores used to be huge
[1:20:55] br0therbrian: get rid of magnolia and make it a mini microcenter build your own zone
[1:21:04] br0therbrian: ez win
[1:21:31] br0therbrian: covid expediated the process that was inevitably gonna happen anyway
[1:21:41] PadidinJones: Oh dude ecommerce have been rising.
[1:21:43] dutchie76: Amazon taking ova
[1:21:44] MasterworkLive: the thing about computer stores is as a gamer or streamer thats one of the ones you want instant gratification on....even amazon or whatever takes a day or 2
[1:21:58] br0therbrian: The only places i can see staying open during ecommerce is clothes
[1:22:03] dutchie76: yea
[1:22:29] br0therbrian: when drone delivery gets mainstream its over for like 99% of storeslmao
[1:22:37] Blistz1: ya E-commerce will demolish the brick and mortor stores
[1:22:46] chrslp: Im one of the rare people that prefers to shop in store and wander aisles over online shopping
[1:22:52] Colt_Engineer: I mean anytime I go into a store to ask for something, I get the same weird stare with a reaponse of, "uh I don't know."
[1:22:58] dutchie76: malls are going away too
[1:23:03] dutchie76: soon enough
[1:23:30] br0therbrian: Why even deal with the social interaction of going into a place and asking some teenager when you could research it online and have it ordered in less than 3 days
[1:23:31] dutchie76: everyone likes that online
[1:23:35] Gorestack: the mahhhh

[1:39:28] YungDizzY: @RomsilGaming some people got paid during the D3 AH days
[1:39:37] Amalgamut: All that borrowed power
[1:39:51] Decoyszn: I don't think of valor as a system at all, it's a currnecy
[1:39:53] Decoyszn: currency *
[1:40:02] ZooNamiii: currency
[1:40:03] br0therbrian: procs on procs on currency
[1:40:17] A_Klimas: I don't like splitting maw currency
[1:40:21] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[1:40:23] dutchie76: remember they said no systems for this expansion?
[1:40:25] dutchie76: i memba
[1:40:26] BBUUTTEERRSSS: monkaW
[1:40:34] CDubTheRIPper: Systemlands monkaS
[1:40:41] dutchie76: systemlands LUL
[1:40:59] br0therbrian: Is retail still gonna be towelliee main focus when tbc drops?
[1:41:17] PvtHudson093: the systems were all front loaded in Slands
[1:41:36] A_Klimas: i spent my time doing this shit and now you tell me its worthless and i gadda grind again for the thing i already earned?
[1:41:49] A_Klimas: eat shit
[1:41:55] dutchie76: yep
[1:42:00] Decoyszn: @A_Klimas Kinda like your gear? Every tier, every level, every expansion? LUL
[1:42:03] dracullatv: Vault needs another system imo. I did 10x +15s for nothing and I got stygia today from vault LUL
[1:42:09] A_Klimas: not in like a month
[1:42:11] dutchie76: re grind for the mythic + gear again LUL
[1:42:26] Decoyszn: @A_Klimas a month? what timeline are you on lol
[1:42:27] dutchie76: yea Vault needs some help imo
[1:42:44] dutchie76: Valor is horrible
[1:43:02] bludthirsty95: borrowed power is a way to keep things balanced in the game man. idk why people fixate so much on "borrowed power". its a complicated game
[1:43:18] dutchie76: yea raids
[1:43:21] Decoyszn: Not sure why y'all complain about content or stuff to do. Would you rather classic with nothing?
[1:43:32] Hitokiri83: 3/6/9
[1:43:34] A_Klimas: yeah my m+ gear I already spent my time grinding cant be upgraded? gadda get the same peice in like a month from now why would i do it now?
[1:43:43] dutchie76: lol

[1:44:34] PadidinJones: @Towelliee what do you mean by reroll?

[1:45:01] A_Klimas: from my vault
[1:45:02] Nicefeetgirl: why? loot is fine as is
[1:45:17] gangstafred: the new loot made me not want to play the game
[1:45:17] Decoyszn: Loot is not fine as is
[1:45:20] dracullatv: Yeah put reroll coin for vault. And coin is farmed doing twisting corridors. Each layer will rewards you x amount of new currenty and you will use this currency to buy reroll coin for vault LUL
[1:45:23] axellent_x: Reroll as in bonus rolls?
[1:45:23] Rygothx: Can anyone tell me why his judgement has two charges?
[1:45:29] PadidinJones: @Towelliee they totally took away more than they gave this expac.
[1:45:32] dracullatv: currency
[1:45:38] sirhapus: @NovaHeadTurner thankyou very much bro!!
[1:46:02] dracullatv: LUL
[1:46:02] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[1:46:07] A_Klimas: yeah loot was worthless last expac but they over corrected. titanforging was laways the problem since legion
[1:46:07] Novaht: @sirhapus no problem ❤️
[1:46:19] dutchie76: i can see them adding gear to ChoreGhast LUL
[1:46:42] sirhapus: im just a lurker love having him on in the backround and i learn loads by what knowlage he says @NovaHeadTurner
[1:46:50] dutchie76: nope
[1:46:57] zuvic: Islands > Torghast
[1:46:57] Nicefeetgirl: mythics should not be 3 piece per timed, 2 is fine, they corrected the raid loot issue, and are adding valor. loot is fine
[1:47:04] its_andyd: neatgangdotcom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 18 month streak! towHAMUP
[1:47:04] brewss: more torghast PogChamp
[1:47:22] dutchie76: lol
[1:47:34] Decoyszn: @Nicefeetgirl valor cap and cost is pretty insane, it needs work. but it is effort on their part
[1:47:38] Zansteh: gotta farm that fish mace, sold that one with 250k
[1:47:46] Novaht: Followed him for years on my other account and even sub to him but I lost that account so I had to make another one. @sirhapus  I even started streaming as well.
[1:47:53] dutchie76: LUL
[1:48:09] Novaht: How’s your night going @towelliee
[1:48:10] tronbadgames: @Towelliee what do you mean one more layer? that wasnti in the blizzcon shit
[1:48:19] Decoyszn: @shutupRoman yah it was
[1:48:41] A_Klimas: its allllll gonna be brought back
[1:48:47] sirhapus: @NovaHeadTurner ah no way have you lost the account you started streaming on ?
[1:48:48] tronbadgames: theyre revamping the maw, adding a side zone..
[1:48:48] trivwik: They making all that money off wow tokens
[1:48:50] A_Klimas: you'll see
[1:48:59] Decoyszn: @shutupRoman yes, AND adding in new torghast
[1:49:05] Novaht: No I started streaming on this one @sirhapus
[1:49:06] Nicefeetgirl: the only thing they need to do now is up the valor gear cap to 226 for 20s or something
[1:49:08] Heavyminded: The Valor system isnt looking to good on the PTR, takes way to long to only upgrade stuff to 220 ilvl imo.
[1:49:34] Decoyszn: @shutupRoman Maw and Torghast....separate.
[1:49:40] sortehenning: They havent updated the prices on valor yet comming next week
[1:49:41] A_Klimas: each expac is an exercize in removing and re-introducing mechanics that people hated
[1:49:43] PadidinJones: And thats ok! Because blizz should be caring about player satisfaction a bit more this expac
[1:49:55] Nicefeetgirl: its absurd that pvp gets 226 for free
[1:50:10] Wheeellz: lmao getting 2100 isnt free
[1:50:14] DrakeDuude: thats a good idea
[1:50:16] Decoyszn: @Nicefeetgirl here we go again LUL. 226 isn't free
[1:50:25] Nicefeetgirl: that could work yeah, the trophy system
[1:50:28] Decoyszn: @Nicefeetgirl go get it if its so easy
[1:50:34] its_andyd: love you towelliee
[1:50:40] Nicefeetgirl: I did, didnt really have a choice
[1:51:01] Nicefeetgirl: which is what im getting at
[1:51:20] YungDizzY: Im leveling a warrior in classic right now, How the fuck did u do it without stabbing your eyes out?
[1:51:22] Decoyszn: having to do it and getting it for free are two different things. 2100 isn't easy, and half the PVE'rs couldn't even get to 1800.
[1:51:50] dHinTrO: It is when you pay for it
[1:51:54] chrslp: Hm the maw sure looks dead...lets make them spend 4x as long in there
[1:51:55] A_Klimas: yeah get 20 souls getr 2 lvls of jailer awareness. such a reward lol
[1:51:56] Nicefeetgirl: to be fair RBGs are also a thing
[1:52:10] A_Klimas: but we gadda do it for renown
[1:52:13] A_Klimas: who they foolin
[1:52:21] Decoyszn: RBG's should not count towards gear rating, that is a fair point.
[1:52:53] olboll: forgot to change my loot spec for vault and got x2 1 handed weps has choice :(
[1:52:58] NOHITJEROME: rbgs dont look easy
[1:53:18] Decoyszn: But, the reality of this whole conversation - is that PVP gearing isn't overpowered, it's that PVE gearing needed fixing. It's absurd to complain about something else instead of bringing your own content up
[1:53:23] DemonicGrizz: @Towelliee I am thinking about rolling a bear tank but have never tanked before any tips you can give to this noob tank
[1:54:18] Decoyszn: Because PVE gearing wasn't adequate. So the solution is to fix PVE, not nerf PVP.
[1:54:26] chrslp: @DemonicGrizz Remember its always the healers fault if anyone dies
[1:54:43] PadidinJones: That has not happened since Wrath @Towelliee
[1:54:46] A_Klimas: We have the BC problem. Some targeted BiS is coming from PvP
[1:54:54] DarthRektus420: yup
[1:54:59] A_Klimas: for PvE
[1:55:11] Decoyszn: Yah, exactly how I feel Towel
[1:55:12] DrakeDuude: true
[1:55:14] Nicefeetgirl: never said nerf pvp, but its kind of a slap to offer up 200 gear for a harder grind
[1:55:20] Nicefeetgirl: 220 even
[1:55:37] Decoyszn: You can't compare 2100 to 15's, bud. it's just not the same
[1:55:38] Nicefeetgirl: longer grind i should say
[1:55:47] dHinTrO: I don’t mind being forced to PvP but... forced to do rated PvP is a big yikes
[1:56:44] Decoyszn: Yup, totally different. And yes, definitely. They messed up PVE for sure.
[1:56:48] yourbrainafterdrugs: makes a lot of people very annoyed
[1:57:03] chrslp: I miss the old days of PVP
[1:57:15] Decoyszn: Agreed
[1:57:23] holypaladinyuh: just joined what we talkin bout
[1:57:23] Katrikan: guys is it worth leveling a new char on classic on another server now for TBC or should I wait for it?
[1:57:28] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now!
[1:57:48] DrakeDuude: 3 weeks of clears no loot my last mythic loot drop was feb 2
[1:57:49] chrslp: @Katrikan Worth starting unless you're set on BE or Draenei
[1:57:59] najra1989: @Katrikan whatever you like. You have plenty of time to level now, should take a bit longer than when TBC hits.
[1:58:02] A_Klimas: its also a problem with itemization right? some classes do not have m+ or mythic raid slots with good stats for their spec
[1:58:14] CDubTheRIPper: i mean youre right. its always been PVE centric. they just bonked things up with PVP
[1:58:18] Katrikan: thank you ^^
[1:58:18] Decoyszn: @A_Klimas Yes, very true
[1:58:21] A_Klimas: so you either get lucky with a vault or you pvp
[1:58:36] Decoyszn: @CDubTheRIPper No they bonked things up with PVE. PVP is pretty damn great.
[1:58:38] A_Klimas: and why wait for a vault
[1:58:43] yourbrainafterdrugs: someone may be a god in raid or dungeons but be dogshit in pvp so that dont make it fair if  the best gear you can with any kind of decent timeline is purely from rated pvp
[1:58:48] CDubTheRIPper: @Decoyszn actually you right lol
[1:58:48] A_Klimas: when you can grind pvpo
[1:59:06] anOceaninadrop: !cam
[1:59:06] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[1:59:20] Decoyszn: The two BIGGEST issues they failed at. A) Pvp wasn't as time gated as PVE, and B) We had a targeted item vendor unlike PVE.
[1:59:39] Decoyszn: If PVE had access to gear as quickly as PVP, and had a targeted item vendor...both camps would be very happy
[2:00:01] godemperordjt: @Towelliee What do you think about the AD legendary buff? Do You think it will be BiS/viable in any content?
[2:00:03] seaperz: most pve gear dont have versa anyway so Doesn´t really matter if you can upgrade 226 in pve
[2:00:08] DarthRektus420: yeah that was actualy pretty crazy to see looking back on
[2:00:24] chrslp: Ive been out in the Barrens farming Zhevra hooves for the past half hour. Strange how many of them dont have FEET
[2:00:30] Decoyszn: nah, they all had 226 weapons. but no one in the game knew 2400 gave 233 weapons.
[2:00:39] GnomeLickerGames: i just dont think pvp should be a main focused way to gear in a game designed to be about pve
[2:00:46] Decoyszn: @seaperz why do you say that?
[2:00:54] dutchie76: exbcGiggle
[2:01:03] godemperordjt: KSM is like 0.5% of the playerbase

[2:01:25] BilboSTTV: Oh lol
[2:01:35] DrakeDuude: m+ has def been down. feels like its tougher this season

[2:01:48] dutchie76: yea @DrakeGamingTV def
[2:02:01] yourbrainafterdrugs: learn fucking mechanics and you can more than likely get ksm but if you go in there and purely rely on your gear you will still fail every time
[2:02:03] dutchie76: dungeons are tougher than BFA imo
[2:02:15] Decoyszn: @DrakeGamingTV the affixes are rough af on any melee
[2:02:16] seaperz: @Decoyszn It doesn´t matter if people say that 226 pvp gear is harder to get then 226 pve gear from keystone master. Most pve gear for specs don´t want versa so...you still want to have pvp gear as a pvper and pveers will get stomped if they go into pvp with 226 gear with no versa
[2:02:17] xmedpakx: dont pvp weps take weeks to upgrade?
[2:02:23] branTVx: so what? should the casuals just log on do a pet battle and get 226 gear? where should they set the bar for casuals to actually have to play the game to get gear?
[2:02:24] SneakyPantsOW: ye i liked bfa dungeons alot more then now to a point where i just dont do dungeons anymore
[2:02:36] GnomeLickerGames: @yourbrainafterdrugs ya but for ppl who play off meta class dont even get that chance still
[2:02:39] gillychrist: @towelliee need advice. I am balding, in a hurry. Should I shave my head or wear a hat ?
[2:02:43] godemperordjt: In BFA you could get KSM in the first week with a good group, still playing cassually
[2:02:45] dHinTrO: @yourbrainafterdrugs yeah except that don’t work lol
[2:02:49] DrakeDuude: I actually prefer the affixes than bfa, i enjoy m+ more, but its less rewarding so i enjoy it less ironicly
[2:03:01] yourbrainafterdrugs: off meta? its a 15 NOT a 30
[2:03:02] Decoyszn: @seaperz What point are you trying to make? I have no idea what you're getting at
[2:03:15] Decoyszn: @bran_1015 Agreed. 15's and higher gear should be hard.
[2:03:24] CDubTheRIPper: ooo thatll be nice
[2:03:28] godemperordjt: Is the KSM valor upgrade also shared to alts?
[2:03:36] dutchie76: its all about mechanics in 5 mans
[2:03:37] Decoyszn: Yes, @godemperordjt
[2:03:40] seaperz: @Decoyszn I think i made myself pretty clear dunno what to say
[2:03:43] godemperordjt: Damn thats nuts

[2:05:22] dHinTrO: bc 2100 isn’t as hard surprisingly lol
[2:05:26] Sacralol: why is that not comparable? I'm a pve only player, but that seems fair
[2:05:36] godemperordjt: @Towelliee What do you think about the AD legendary buff? Do You think it will be BiS/viable in any content?
[2:05:37] YungDizzY: they done stupid things like that before...
[2:05:38] Decoyszn: @seaperz You mentioned pve gear not having versa and getting stomped in pvp without versa. No one was even discussing that LUL
[2:05:43] Sacralol: thats not an arguement
[2:05:44] oraclespyro: ya  its the  equvlent to aotc and cutting edhe  correct @Towelliee
[2:06:02] bludthirsty95: tbh... people underestimate how hard getting 1.8k rating is. in 2s , 3s or rbg. way harder than KSM
[2:06:11] Decoyszn: @dHinTrO says who? its actually pretty damn hard, a lot of glads last season cant even get 1800 this season.
[2:06:38] DemonicGrizz: Hey everyone which is better for a guardian druid Tauren or Troll?
[2:06:43] Decoyszn: 2.1k isn't easy. Truth be told, Towel was a prot pally which in the very beginning was broken to hell and back....doesn't count.
[2:06:48] yourbrainafterdrugs: alright here is my thing @GnomeLickerGames off meta is not that big a deal... if you are good at your class and realizing/doing mechanics you can push ksm because there are weeks easy enough to shit on a dungeon with the lesser classes/specs as long as you run with people that can do the same thing
[2:06:56] Sacralol: No, refered to the comment about having 2100 on your main and getting to buy 226 on you alt with conquest :)
[2:06:56] Shrenko: @DemonicGrizz in classic?
[2:06:57] CDubTheRIPper: you really cant compare. IMO its much harder to get 2100 than KSM. people who get KSM might not get be able to get 2100 but people who get 2100 can easily do KSM
[2:06:59] its_andyd: im high
[2:06:59] Aphro_Samurai: This tew much
[2:07:01] chrslp: Taurens best druids imo LUL
[2:07:02] dHinTrO: It’s debatable for sure but from my exp gladiator doesn’t even get looked at the same way
[2:07:07] pereadin: @DemonicGrizz tauren
[2:07:09] deerp_tv: @DemonicGrizz I like Highmountain Tauren if you're talking retial
[2:07:12] deerp_tv: retail
[2:07:15] DemonicGrizz: @Shrenko No retail
[2:07:28] Decoyszn: @dHinTrO Thats because most people who don't pvp have no clue how hard it is to compete at higher rankings
[2:07:34] PhoenixAuTv: dude it would be impossible to do alt kys, hardest  bit is not completing, its getting invited @towelliee
[2:07:36] Shrenko: @DemonicGrizz race racials isnt that big of a difference in retail
[2:08:02] PhoenixAuTv: ksm not kys.... jesus auto correc5
[2:08:10] CDubTheRIPper: much of PVE stuff is static as well, PVP is not
[2:08:10] chrslp: High ranked PVPers in TBC were pretty highly regarded iirc
[2:08:37] yourbrainafterdrugs: some people cant play as much
[2:08:37] Moobot: Bluepost confirms Valor Points system coming 9.0.5 sometime in March | https://www.wowhead.com/news=320846/blizzard-post-on-patch-9-0-5-ptr-patch-should-release-in-march
[2:08:43] Sacralol: it is! :) it's an identity issue I think. PvE'ers hating on pvpers having it equally easy
[2:08:49] Colt_Engineer: dranor
[2:08:50] GnomeLickerGames: @yourbrainafterdrugs tell that to the player base that wont invite anyone because they want only range or specific comps LUL u may believe that and i agree with u but most dont think that way
[2:09:19] A_Klimas: even vanilla was catering to casual Everquest players
[2:09:25] A_Klimas: for real
[2:09:37] A_Klimas: thats why WoW was successful
[2:09:45] CDubTheRIPper: dalaran picnic PepeHands
[2:09:45] PhoenixAuTv: yep
[2:09:59] yourbrainafterdrugs: @GnomeLickerGames ill run with ANYONE that knows their shit and has enough gear to push... cant really crutch on that because you will find somebody of character sooner or later that judges you based on your skill and not your class/spec
[2:09:59] trivwik: Sanguine Depths is just horrid
[2:10:03] Decoyszn: @yourbrainafterdrugs heres the thing - everyones counter argument is "well meta is bullshit because its still possible with any class and spec" of course, no one ever said its not. But, its about being easier. It's much easier to do it with a disc/shaman/pal and a DH and 3 ranged than 3 melees - its just facts
[2:10:08] jaysteea: get guild is the only way now
[2:10:08] dHinTrO: You gotta be patient like a mf with people
[2:10:25] listadiss: That’s true I had a 10 on DoS and the whole group left me and burned my key
[2:10:26] CDubTheRIPper: man getting into 15s as a Venthyr Ret was so horrendous. literally 10/300 attempts
[2:10:35] PhoenixAuTv: @towelliee when you tank it perfectly and people die to dodgable mechanics. i cbf doing 13-14 than 15. Why im just lookin for 15s
[2:10:45] trivwik: Try being a resto druid
[2:10:47] OG_Fear: @Towelliee I pugged my KSM as a warlock So Idk why people have issues getting in keys.
[2:11:01] YungDizzY: I was Here!!

[2:11:03] GnomeLickerGames: @yourbrainafterdrugs bro was a 203 fury warrior i find it hard to get invited to even 5s and when all u can go off of is IO score u cant make a conclusion of if someone knows their stuff
[2:11:07] Decoyszn: @yourbrainafterdrugs If I'm comparing a mage vs a ret in LFG, there is no reason to ever take the ret...it's just not a choice. Is it still possible with the ret? Of course. Will my life be easier with the mage? Yes.
[2:11:07] warrenny: @cdubtheripper Ismt venthyr good for ret
[2:11:18] OG_Fear: OG_Fear subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:11:29] OG_Fear: Forgot ot resuse my prime
[2:11:31] PrimogenitureJ: I remember those days, FL was some of the best content days for wow. Molten front and towelliee after dark for life bro
[2:11:36] CDubTheRIPper: @warrenny yeah but people dont want Rets for dungeons and if they do theyd want a Kyrian most likely
[2:12:02] CDubTheRIPper: venthyr is better for raids than dungeons imo
[2:12:06] trivwik: Huge influence
[2:12:08] warrenny: @cdubtheripper As a necro ret i usually make my own groups got ksc a few weeks ago
[2:12:09] Decoyszn: @warrenny Ret is a pretty bad spec and is melee in M+, compared to other DPS (which keep in mind, DPS players are about an entire states population worth to come by - plenty to pick from, its like Tinder)
[2:12:13] yourbrainafterdrugs: that just proves you are someone i would not run with @Decoyszn... fuck making everything so simple that you can take a nap mid key that shit is boring
[2:12:26] godemperordjt: Imagine playing a non-meta DPS class and trying to find a group for 14-15s
[2:12:41] nohmohpls: @Towelliee how do you have the venth back?
[2:12:53] branTVx: @Towelliee off topic, but what are you looking forward to the most out of TBC? and if you could make 1 #somechanges, what would it be?
[2:12:56] CDubTheRIPper: @warrenny yeahh i did for some of my 15s but most were pugs unfortunately
[2:13:06] Decoyszn: @yourbrainafterdrugs That is good for you, make everything hard on yourself and if that is fun - nothing is wrong with that. But, it doesn't take away the facts lol
[2:13:09] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @therockofgibraltar (warning)
[2:13:13] snoo_32: wow spec design is turning into albion online design. Specs are good at 1 specific game mode, and suck at other modes i think.
[2:13:17] porowozek: correction: they're gonna try and fail
[2:13:18] GnomeLickerGames: kinda the point that i was trying to make if ur a off meta class spec player u may never even get invited to a group
[2:13:23] its_andyd: half my guild
[2:13:25] CDubTheRIPper: @warrenny how is Necro ret? i wanted to go Necro for the plate armor alone lol
[2:13:41] Urebaldd: I went ww purely because my fury warr couldn't get any groups
[2:14:05] Decoyszn: And that has nothing to do with community, it's blizzard balancing and affix design.
[2:14:06] therockofgibraltar: yea that really pisses me off when key leaders don't even know what rio score x8 for a key level is and they ask for an rio that's higher than that key level x8, which is absurd. like you're either dumb or asking for a carry in LFG
[2:14:25] Demanisraar: I play ret in m+ and it's absolutley fine.. I play in a guild group though
[2:14:28] CritcobainTV: PogChamp
[2:14:28] PvtHudson093: i gave up on Slands
[2:14:29] warrenny: @cdubtheripper Great for aoe i do hc raids but mainly m+ so it works
[2:14:34] tospro: retail looks so complicated
[2:14:41] nohmohpls: @therockofgibraltar i know what you mean, its ridic
[2:14:44] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar No one ever said it wasn't fine, just not ideal.
[2:14:45] PhoenixAuTv: @towelliee what are you maining and alting tbc??
[2:14:50] railroad10989: i love the groups that ask for 1k+ but they are like 800 or lower
[2:14:52] PhoenixAuTv: also why
[2:14:54] CritcobainTV: I just need to know what's gonna be the best money maker in TBC class wise @Towelliee  cause mage aoe farming got nerfed
[2:15:03] CDubTheRIPper: @warrenny thats good to hear
[2:15:14] HotHotHeals: warlock not wanted?
[2:15:15] snoo_32: well ret is very good in arena, but kinda of not as good inMythic + or raids. So every spec has a certain mode to shine
[2:15:18] HotHotHeals: ha try being havoc
[2:15:21] PhoenixAuTv: Like character your going to play, pally, warrior ect...
[2:15:25] godemperordjt: The vault blessed my prot paladin today and got the Gods Signet 226 with big dick haste
[2:15:28] cryft: hiss casulas
[2:15:33] GnomeLickerGames: locks are a top dps class
[2:15:34] keeindordel: casuals=lazy
[2:15:35] Decoyszn: Warlocks are totally wanted
[2:15:36] Demanisraar: @Decoyszn , who cares about ideal.. just play what you enjoy... you will be a better player anyway if you have fun with it
[2:15:39] Savagee320: @Towelliee are you going alliance or horde for TBC?
[2:15:51] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar That isn't the point of discussion.
[2:15:56] Savagee320: ok
[2:16:01] CritcobainTV: !tbc
[2:16:01] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now!
[2:16:26] kislikss: @Towelliee  i made all my keys +15 on my Guardian druide and it was fun !!! All healers was happy saying best tank to heal :D
[2:16:27] CritcobainTV: Speaking of that, I need to get on there and start leveling my early farming toon LUL

[2:16:28] PhoenixAuTv: @towelliee i want to main with pally, but not sure if warriors/druids be better at that. they sound better for bosses
[2:16:35] snoo_32: @Demanisraar if you want to play at the top level, you got to use the best builds and specs. Maybe you can do low level keys, but top game is different
[2:16:38] pereadin: Yeah I switched from BSing back to Engi
[2:16:54] godemperordjt: Why not engineering?
[2:17:17] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee any idea what's good at gold farming in tbc? Mage got nerfed so idk if anything else is busted
[2:17:30] Demanisraar: @snoo_32 I was refering to a guy who said not getting in pug keys.. that is not top level.. if you play top level m+ you have a fixed group most of the time
[2:17:37] pereadin: Bro i'm excited AF for BC Shockadin
[2:18:12] cryft: hard af to get uncrushable but when you do you're a wall
[2:18:24] cryft: or uncrittable? one of those

[2:18:41] snoo_32: @Demanisraar oh ok, my bad. Yea pugs usually are not usually very friendly environment unless you can be the party leader. My bad friend.
[2:18:58] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[2:19:01] EveStarsTV: do you think they will continue to make classic x-packs, like WotLK after TBC classic?
[2:19:08] Athaeln: KEKW
[2:19:18] Decoyszn: @EveStarsTV They already said if the community wants it, they are open to WOTLK
[2:19:22] Colt_Engineer: yeah I had a my boss got a cease and disist from playing on a private sever without a vpn
[2:19:25] Phunsox: They say 2021 for TBC, but that sounds a little too good to be true
[2:19:26] CDubTheRIPper: lmao
[2:19:34] Demanisraar: @snoo_32 yeah it's toxic AF.. I don't get in pug groups myself as ret.. that is why I started a guild group.. the way to go imo
[2:19:49] Decoyszn: @Phunsox Why? It's old content.
[2:19:59] CDubTheRIPper: ok yours makes sense but why did chance do it after? LUL
[2:20:08] Demanisraar: @snoo_32 And you can do your 15's with any class... I understand if you push 20's that you need to play the meta game
[2:20:20] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar It isn't toxic. the problem isnt the community, its that blizzard can't balance their game.
[2:20:25] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[2:20:51] A_Klimas: they are very protective. why you think soda is gone
[2:20:57] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[2:20:57] Demanisraar: @Decoyszn But if I want to join a +13, it should be no issue on any class you know what I mean?
[2:20:58] sakura_2020: KEKW
[2:20:59] Phunsox: Its still like 800,000 lines of code @Decoyszn
[2:21:00] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar The community wouldn't be like that if affixes weren't far more punishing to melee than ranged or fire mages weren't aoe capped, but other specs are.
[2:21:01] PadidinJones: Cuz thats Chance the Cat!
[2:21:18] PhoenixAuTv: i love soda, he dont give a f aha
[2:21:24] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar It's not, BUT you can never say human nature is toxic - we're obviously gonna form a group that givues us a higher chance of success
[2:21:34] trivwik: He is the true "BAN"wagon
[2:21:45] PadidinJones: Its true. @Towelliee  you always talk about BC and reminisce of it
[2:21:46] TheUnknowing: that they have already been working on @Phunsox they didnt announce that they were just now starting to work on it lol
[2:21:46] godemperordjt: Cant wait for BfA legacy servers
[2:21:59] Artivicii: Artivicii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months! TBC had the best dungeons until Legion m+
[2:21:59] A_Klimas: he even did a rant back when we were launching OW saying it was a targeted thing. literally everyone on the OW team didnt have a clue who he was
[2:22:00] kodemonkee: I was born in Cataclysm LUL
[2:22:00] trivwik: said no one ever
[2:22:05] YungDizzY: Soda seems more grown up now then what he used to be
[2:22:09] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar Take maybe the fact that a healer is a little undergeared. Any extra healing they have to do on melee could make you wipe, compared to rarely needing to heal ranged and focusing on the tank?
[2:22:10] Chris_127: were you blood elf in bc?
[2:22:14] Siddyy: breaded with flour or...?
[2:22:15] cryft: im glad BC classic peeps get their game but i wont be playing, i already played bc back in the day not hype for it again
[2:22:19] godemperordjt: @Towelliee What do you think about the AD legendary buff? Do You think it will be BiS/viable in any content?
[2:22:21] A_Klimas: like whi the fuck is soda to fps people
[2:22:47] Soproatlol: is the leveling still broken in bc?
[2:22:56] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar I think the issue is people hear this meta and comp stuff, and think that means everyone believes it's just not possible with a ret. Of course it is, but you'll have a much higher chance of chesting it with a fire mage instead
[2:23:00] Noshpan: @towelliee Who are the people that can invite to the TBC guild? Just you & Gatts?
[2:23:05] YungDizzY: I remember
[2:23:19] Kalidin79: LUL fuckin posers
[2:23:20] DrakeDuude: Im like, yay new patch for retail
[2:23:20] Mcmackle: playing horde TBC
[2:23:20] PvtHudson093: vanilla was only good the first time round
[2:23:31] Demanisraar: @Decoyszn I understand what you are saying.. but people take their little 10 key waaay to serious lol
[2:23:32] Mcmackle: playing horde TBC?
[2:23:42] BilboSTTV: As some one who started in wrath should I defo play BC for the exp
[2:23:45] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar For sure, some people do I agree with that
[2:23:52] ARROOCE: I probably wont even play TBC, its the same like classic, gonna be dead after 2-4 weeks
[2:23:55] Demanisraar: @Decoyszn and I agree, melee friendly is not a thing in blizz's book
[2:23:58] Phunsox: @TheUnknowing True, but its a small team
[2:24:01] YungDizzY: I was playing Privte servers during TBC because i didnt have enough money to pay for live
[2:24:36] godemperordjt: When do you think 9.05 and 9.1 are coming out?

[2:24:41] Decoyszn: @Demanisraar Like you don't have that kind of toxicity in raids because it's a lot more balanced (as an overall dps stand point). But affixes and aoe caps just changes M+ entirely
[2:24:57] warrenny: @yungdizzy I didnt even play wow was like 10
[2:25:14] CritcobainTV: I made a mage over here on Azuresong to farm some gold for when i can make my belf rogue. So hopefully i can catch u or gattz on
[2:25:17] TheUnknowing: You have to realize that they have probably been working on this for over a year now @Phunsox
[2:25:33] TheUnknowing: yeah its a lot of code but it doesnt take that much time
[2:25:40] Demanisraar: @Decoyszn yeah.. as a melee myself for example.. the tornados are a bitch to deal with.. and if you have explosive mixed in there also it's horrible lol
[2:25:41] A_Klimas: sure as fuck glad it was possible lol, i would be pissed if i was still bustin my ass on twisting if they are already talking about a crafted maw mount that looks identical. got my and gtfo
[2:25:43] Noshpan: I have a bank alt up & starting on the TBC server. At least until BEs become available
[2:26:34] Decoyszn: @Phunsox And what, you think that code just starts over from scratch? The beta is going to already be out soon....I'm curious why you think it's this big whole ordeal for them
[2:26:46] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee the "overgearing" thing is nonsense btw for Torghast. I just did layer 8 solo on a 165 ilvl boomkin for Skoldis Halls
[2:27:05] warrenny: Cant you mount normally in o.1 maw
[2:27:21] Decoyszn: @Towelliee Ion won't give any info. He said "Figure it out" - when asked about the mount and crafting
[2:27:22] CritcobainTV: I maen, i did it on a shadow priest at like 175 too LUL
[2:27:23] yourbrainafterdrugs: yeah boomkin go brrrrrrrr
[2:27:29] Katrikan: done up to layer 7 with 155 enhan shamy
[2:27:29] Decoyszn: @warrenny Yes
[2:27:39] CritcobainTV: but i didn't have a legendary :(
[2:27:50] Ishva: Try layer 8 as a 165 Ass rogue you will know what hating life is like hahaha
[2:28:10] CritcobainTV: @Ishva It's easy if you dont play assassination LUL
[2:28:18] Ishva: hAHAHQA
[2:28:22] yourbrainafterdrugs: rogues got problems everywhere but pvp lmfao
[2:28:32] Decoyszn: @Ishva Wait, you play that spec? Why? That's like playing Survival Hunter.
[2:28:39] alluza: @Towelliee  no rogues are not having it as eazy as you paladins and other op classes
[2:28:46] Decoyszn: @yourbrainafterdrugs They have problems in PVP too
[2:28:51] Noshpan: Rogues got 99 problems, pvp ain't 1
[2:29:07] Decoyszn: If you know anything about high rated pvp, rogues aren't really that strong rn.
[2:29:12] traximmus: I mailed sub at start  and it was fking easy (1st time playing it)
[2:29:16] yourbrainafterdrugs: they have enough cc to make up for it @Decoyszn
[2:29:16] Ishva: oh no i dont play Ass rogue but i have seen the tears when i do torgast as a prot pally :)
[2:29:24] Decoyszn: @yourbrainafterdrugs What rating do you play at?
[2:29:30] Corbic247: everything has stealth detection in Torghast. meaning its hard for us to get openers on mobs to do good dmg. regardless of powers. but if things didnt have stealth detection we would just stealth past all mobs and go straight to floor bosses and do torghast in 10 minutes. blizzard doesnt want taht. we have to play there game afterall.
[2:29:46] warrenny: Coldheart plume?
[2:29:46] Stahlram: Good morning o/
[2:30:01] Xytrixz: Theres a couple powers like that, I remember I screwed a Twisting run I did once by taking frostbite wand from the rare xD
[2:30:05] Pinkerbelletje: is there any point in prepping for tbc if you don't have a lvl 60 yet?
[2:30:06] yourbrainafterdrugs: i hardly ever pvp because i get bored around 1700 @Decoyszn
[2:30:24] Decoyszn: @yourbrainafterdrugs Then that makes sense :) Anything above 2.1k and its easy to deal with rogues
[2:30:40] CritcobainTV: @thecorbicsupreme you know you can still skip it all right? get a few good powers, pop a sprint and once you out range the mobs vanish and you acn still skip most of torghast lol
[2:30:59] yourbrainafterdrugs: oh i dont have an issue with them normally but i have seen a lot of people have those issues
[2:31:01] Stahlram: you can grind gold ye
[2:31:01] Decoyszn: @yourbrainafterdrugs It's kind of like convoke. Convoke is strong af under a specific rating, but anything high rated and convoke is useless because those players can easily counter it
[2:31:04] WymGaming: you get 1 boost
[2:31:06] Corbic247: @critcobain yeah i know that.
[2:31:11] jexx1337: I hope there will be new servers for fresh starters

[2:31:35] Phunsox: It took Classic almost 2 years to be released after it was announced at Blizzcon in 2017. @Decoyszn
[2:31:39] Artivicii: u still on nat pagle towelliee?
[2:31:48] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[2:31:52] Phunsox: And I am sure they were working on it prior to Blizzcon 2017
[2:31:53] DrakeDuude: need flying to get to some of the dungeons in netherstorm
[2:31:59] PrismaticFlair: Wait when is bc coming out?
[2:32:19] warrenny: The abom?
[2:32:19] PadidinJones: Making a buttons plushy would be tricky. Too many breakable parts on an abomb
[2:32:26] Decoyszn: @DamagedPrism Late summer 21 most likely, but they said 21 in general.
[2:32:31] Pinkerbelletje: yeah that's pretty much the only reason i'd lvl rn. druid best for gold farming in classic then?
[2:32:47] PrismaticFlair: thank you @Decoyszn ^_^
[2:32:51] CritcobainTV: mage is best in classic, but gets nerfed hard in tbc
[2:32:59] Artivicii: im so stoked for druids in TBC; being a boomy off healer, off tanker
[2:33:27] Decoyszn: @Phunsox If they basically have TBC beta ready, then that means they aren't that far off bud. If they release it late summer 21, that'll be about two years most likely
[2:33:31] CDubTheRIPper: towelstradamus Kappa
[2:33:36] aid280: It's obvious theyll be doing the trio and stop there.
[2:33:42] PrismaticFlair: im gonna go get to work then, i want my affliction warlock, AND a resto druid
[2:33:47] Decoyszn: @Phunsox ALSO, most likely - their team for classic is larger today than it was prior to classic launching.
[2:34:09] Artivicii: @DamagedPrism OP ass arena classes KEKW
[2:34:11] YungDizzY: So SHE KNOWS!!!
[2:34:15] PrismaticFlair: ^_^

[2:35:00] Phunsox: TBC beta is ready?
[2:35:00] sprert: Shortly after the release of classic it was relatively clear tbc is coming because activision loves money, it was only a matter of how it will be released.
[2:35:16] Decoyszn: @Phunsox They said it'll be going live anytime soon now
[2:35:17] porowozek: wait I've seen it in recap video

[2:36:57] A_Klimas: or that thrall panel
[2:37:01] PadidinJones: I would say sad but im proud of Lula as well!

[2:37:08] porowozek: Lula is the best! That burger and D2 were my highlits of Blizzcon =)
[2:37:28] Decoyszn: @Phunsox Yah, no real way to know but you can opt in and they said it's coming very soon.
[2:37:56] YungDizzY: So they gonna announce a new expasion the same year it gonna come out?
[2:38:08] Decoyszn: @YungDizzY No?
[2:38:11] dkwhitegorilla: Trying to find a toon to make on classic

[2:39:36] nitemare34godd: hey all
[2:39:56] Decoyszn: @Morpheusx25 you get to keep dying ;)
[2:39:57] YungDizzY: @Decoyszn if the next blizzcon is in 2022 and they been releasing WoW expasions every 2 years since the game came out then how not? unless they push it back
[2:40:14] Decoyszn: @YungDizzY My guess is some sort of online announcement
[2:40:19] Touchpadwarrior: idk yet to be honest
[2:40:25] Decoyszn: @YungDizzY But not a full blown "Blizzcon"
[2:40:38] CritcobainTV: I am Disappoint
[2:41:01] Touchpadwarrior: I don't have the time to dedicate to it like I did when i was 14 lol

[2:42:23] Decoyszn: @YungDizzY Everything is a little tipped on its head right now. If I had to make a bet right now, I'd say next expansion early early 2023 with an announcement early 2022
[2:42:25] Touchpadwarrior: dude i actually texted him last month lol
[2:42:27] YungDizzY: @Decoyszn So you saying they are still going to announce the next expasion this yea

[2:43:15] YungDizzY: @Decoyszn we will see
[2:43:15] Decoyszn: @YungDizzY Given that timelines are delayed, it seems unlikely to me that we get news on a new expansion this year.

[4:21:03] Laelas_sm: its paid to have it in both classic AND TBC
[4:21:05] pereadin: I hhope they make it possible to just race chhange and server transfer

[4:23:32] CritcobainTV: you can server transfer can't you? I gave my 1700g away on my other realm when i decided to stop playing until BC so im screwed either way LUL
[4:23:40] Baernern: the main road out of ratchet would have been way faster sry :p

[4:29:00] source__2: Towelliee ur a legend dude, thanks for streaming at this time haha
[4:29:23] Moxnix13: Classic took more since they had to REBUILD it though
[4:29:24] Quakezilla69: I think people are just excited, given how long it looks like we are going to be grinding on9.0/9.0.5
[4:29:42] Moxnix13: TBC they already have and just need to bug test for relaunch
[4:29:52] MissyKib: this time they also had the code they just have to port it over to the newer client
[4:29:57] Basedd_god: pandatvHehe
[4:29:58] Blistz1: i feel like they will release it when it doestn conflict with 9.1
[4:30:11] Moxnix13: 9.1 is gonna be a long time off
[4:30:25] Moxnix13: they didnt even have samples to show off for 9.1
[4:30:59] Zvent90: I thought 9.1 would come before TBC
[4:31:00] Moxnix13: They didnt have ANYTHING and kept talking about new systems...
[4:31:06] Shrenko: good, then I got time for KSM and 1800 rating maybe and the pvp spider mount
[4:31:08] CritcobainTV: OMEGALUL
[4:31:09] Drogdorf: KEKW

[4:32:05] Shrenko: @Diangelos13 what do you mean?
[4:32:38] Moxnix13: 9.1 is still in concept phase... they litterally have TBC stored and just are dragging it out right now
[4:32:50] zulkhanis: TBC is most likely going to be around late summer (august)
[4:33:07] zulkhanis: maybe july
[4:33:08] CritcobainTV: @Diangelos13 you mean apart from Beta, and all the testing and bug fixing they still nee to do? yeah. just dragging it out LUL
[4:33:20] Shrenko: 9.1 is like 4 - 5 months away, TBC atleast 6 months @Diangelos13
[4:33:35] sagethemage40: Are they still working from home?
[4:33:36] Moxnix13: You really expect a lot of bug fixes for a game that they dont have any new content to add and have already said they have the code for?
[4:33:38] sagethemage40: The devs
[4:33:48] 91Niki: A ton of 9.1 content was still on concept art. so yeah. it will be a while. it is no way near finished. like the raids was still sketches the ones they showed us
[4:33:51] CritcobainTV: @Diangelos13 tell that to classic my man

[4:35:46] Aphro_Samurai: @Towelliee did you see the guy who beat hades on a run using a pomegranate as a controller?
[4:35:49] CritcobainTV: I just can't believe this guy thinks that classic TBC is gonna have no bugs lol

[4:39:57] CritcobainTV: U don't have to buy the expansion, it's just like the way classic works @xtkid92x
[4:40:02] 無職提督: but on the other hand, the PS5 control r falling hard worldwise
[4:40:06] CritcobainTV: it's included in the retail subscription

[4:42:41] XlOz: @91Niki Damn lucky yooou! :D so jelly

[4:43:00] 91Niki: Oh damn, ebay is full of ps5s. but they aren't all like overpriced. some are just a few dollars more expensive than store price
[4:43:00] CritcobainTV: FeelsBadMan
[4:43:03] 無職提督: the blueray dvd player was way ahead of the time
[4:43:34] DarthRektus420: yeah i remember my dad being really hype about the blu ray player the ps3 had
[4:43:37] Aphro_Samurai: i still have my 2nd gen one sitting next to my ps4 right now. the fat one that didnt have backwards capatability
[4:43:52] Neowanderer: just like xbox 360's or 1's that had the circle of death or melted down

[4:44:52] Thepilli: howdy boys
[4:45:02] Neowanderer: i think i went thru like 4 xbox 360s
[4:45:08] chickenboo1989: @Towelliee  use the Harem skill thats been introduced to classic!
[4:45:31] birdehh87: @Neowanderer, that was my brothers luck with it

[4:55:05] TheFabilolz: catJAM
[4:55:54] WoW_StandalonE: a lot of ppl have a  shitton of gold
[4:56:10] Eikus11: I dont get why people care so much about how much gold other people have? It does not affect you
[4:56:39] Moxnix13: You know the econ is busted when a naxx drop gbid for 198k gold
[4:56:59] Lazugo: Lazugo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! DING
[4:56:59] CritcobainTV: @Ikeadin definitely does lol. All the people with a lot of gold right now are gonna be the same people controlling markets in bc. Instant epic flying means they can take even more gold from you in TBC
[4:57:01] lanara233: If people have lots of gold, AH prices are higher
[4:57:02] Moxnix13: Thousand Needles, lv28ish
[4:57:07] feherlofia123: what was the gold cap in BC again
[4:57:11] tauntpleas: the hyena
[4:57:18] oradros: "ash of alar drop"  gold maker:  "the day I was waiting for"
[4:57:19] Moxnix13: Hyena pats the zone
[4:57:20] tauntpleas: ina pack
[4:58:21] Daishuki: are they gonna reset the market for tbc?
[4:58:24] Moxnix13: Prices of Primals are going to be absurd the first month or 2 easy
[4:58:43] oradros: server first 70 back in bc had his epic flying day 1
[4:58:54] Aphro_Samurai: as long as i can get mines ( flying etc) idc about the rest of the econ . im not one to buy off ah unless its needed like mats sometimes
[4:59:00] GiraffeHydra_: They shouldnt have to suffer, but we should be able to avoid them
[4:59:01] oradros: well as he hit 70 XD
[4:59:10] CritcobainTV: That's my point. I'm not saying anyone should suffer, but it would just be dope to have an option for people that DO want a full reset to get it
[4:59:39] CritcobainTV: but i get that they dont want people leaving the realms they're on now and decreasing the population
[4:59:50] DreavT2K: spells do not auto upgrade
[4:59:56] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee spells wont update on bars automatically, only melee abilities
[4:59:59] WebsterLou: Shapeshifting abilites auto ra nk up
[5:00:04] DreavT2K: only things like rage ranks etc
[5:00:05] WebsterLou: rank*
[5:00:18] SicDogg: why no cam ?
[5:00:28] Shrenko: !cam
[5:00:28] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a couple of days
[5:00:29] WebsterLou: yes
[5:00:37] SicDogg: !cam
[5:00:47] Shrenko: @SicDogg just read...
[5:00:55] SicDogg: thx
[5:00:59] arukaen: damn, that medication sounds hot LUL
[5:01:05] Aphro_Samurai: spells you can downrank. melee abilities cant so thats why they auto upgrade
[5:01:06] Dirtroit: as someone who started playing when the game came out... classic makes no sense to me. it's just so outdated compared to today's iteration of the game
[5:01:11] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee spells that cost mana aren't updated automatically i think, the rest should
[5:01:20] josh8555: reagents ahhhhhh the good ole days lmao
[5:01:28] arukaen: @Dirtroit for most people, todays version of the game is ass and thats why they love classic

[5:02:24] Shinjuro: LuvPeekL
[5:02:55] MissyKib: You can make macros for the forms to hot swap between them
[5:03:06] Alavit: make macros for them all and remove the rank bit
[5:03:07] CritcobainTV: starfire i think
[5:03:09] CritcobainTV: long ass cast tho
[5:03:16] Alavit: so like /cast healing touch will cast your max rank healing touch
[5:03:22] arukaen: @Dirtroit classic at its peak had more than retail. I know plenty of people who came back to classic and then left again once the nostalgia wore off.
[5:03:27] MissyKib: when your leveling you use the latest on learnt
[5:03:34] MissyKib: and rock back and forwards as you level
[5:03:35] OnyxLair77: Hey bro where do I find what headset you use
[5:03:45] Alavit: cat form now easy mode begins
[5:03:48] Alavit: with talents yes
[5:03:50] Boozehound: talent dude
[5:03:56] Rottencoarse: yeah that's a talent
[5:04:01] Alavit: yup
[5:04:03] Rottencoarse: yup
[5:04:04] huggisho: you need the talent
[5:04:10] Dirtroit: @arukaen you've only further proved my point that the nostalgia isn't enough
[5:04:10] InstaKiill: @Towelliee Go feral for leveling. Use mana before jumping into cat form, wrath moonfire - heal
[5:04:11] Shinjuro: tauren are just bulky so they appear to be moving slower
[5:04:13] Moxnix13: You can just make macros for your common skills to ALWAYS use max rank of that skill so you dont have to keep updating bars
[5:04:18] Denitorious: @arukaen just like pokemon..bought a gameboy just to play it and sold it two or three days later.
[5:04:50] Moxnix13: Thats what I ended up doing for MoTW/Thorns so I dont have to keep updating them

[5:05:20] Shinjuro: i might come back for TBC i had most fun leveling at that
[5:05:35] arukaen: @Dirtroit youre missing the point. plently of people came back for the nostalgia of classic and plenty stayed too because they enjoyed the state of the game. People playing Classic and TBC don't like retail and how bad it is.
[5:06:21] arukaen: @Denitorious you couldve downloaded an emulator lol.
[5:06:28] burty_burt69: are you on azuresong right now?

[5:08:24] faulen: Not yet, you get it at a different lvl
[5:08:26] Shinjuro: i think the stealth comes to an advantage later
[5:08:27] CritcobainTV: rake i think from stealth still stuns
[5:08:33] Aphro_Samurai: does he know about the move speed slow on prowl?
[5:08:43] CritcobainTV: 70% i think on prowl
[5:08:46] WebsterLou: @critcobain na it dont its pounce that does
[5:08:46] kochen3: Pounce stuns in classic, rake doesnt im 99%
[5:08:52] CritcobainTV: @WebsterLou that's right, my bad
[5:08:54] Somakarma: Does classic allow mods?
[5:08:58] WebsterLou: all good my g
[5:09:12] WebsterLou: @Somakarma you can get addons if thats what you mean bro

[5:10:44] faulen: the combo points are on the TARGET
[5:10:54] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee in classic your combo points are on your target not on the player
[5:11:08] scottiepalmer: i think your elvui will take care of you

[5:26:02] at1c: Feral better?
[5:26:12] PadidinJones: aww balls
[5:26:17] Thunderbrew: You can't make a character in TBC?
[5:26:20] Blvdman: Feral is better for leveling due to low downtime
[5:26:21] josh8555: yes confirmed pay for boost
[5:26:33] PadidinJones: multi dolla company
[5:26:44] Reiumi_: I expect them to charge me for everything
[5:26:45] Armdel: they are called "Activi$ion" for a reason

[5:26:55] mavericks312: talking CoD minded blizzard now
[5:26:57] Syllvn: Why would they give it for free? You aren't paying for CLassic
[5:26:59] Daddyknut: will the boost come in pre patch or at launch?
[5:27:11] Blvdman: @simplySylvan we are paying for classic
[5:27:19] josh8555: prepatch
[5:27:23] Zivs: you're not paying an expansion fee tho
[5:27:35] Blvdman: payment is still payment regardless how much
[5:27:42] Syllvn: @Blvdman Nah subbing is not the same as a box price, like Retail
[5:28:00] ChiefMango: @Blvdman you're paying for classic so you expect free boost to max lvl?
[5:28:11] Blvdman: @ChiefMango ? no one said that

[5:29:10] Blvdman: azeroth autopilot for classic was a godsend
[5:29:17] k1ngtmac: @towelliee do you think they should put a gold cap?  In for TBC.
[5:29:24] Nottinghams: if that's the case, those with an existing account over 58 should not be eligible tbh
[5:29:26] Artivicii: u pay now MingLee
[5:29:44] Kyrrua: Boost was a given, easy money for activision. even if u get 1 million signing against your opinion does not matter to them compared to the money they will make
[5:29:47] HopeThePriest: you still have to go through the pain of leveling in classic
[5:29:56] DeanoTV: i cant even lvl to 10 in classic too boring imo
[5:30:05] superxfire: Do druids get flight form for “free” in TBC?
[5:30:12] Artivicii: yah
[5:30:15] Artivicii: @Konpacu ya
[5:30:19] Blvdman: Only thing I think that some may say sucks is the gold transfer from classic to tbc. kills some hype of pseudo fresh start.
[5:30:21] superxfire: Cool
[5:30:23] Kyrrua: complaining on boosts is wasting time for over things

[5:31:02] Artivicii: @Konpacu just the form, i think u still need to pay 4k for the training like everyone else
[5:31:04] Shrenko: lvling is the best part of classic @DeanoTV
[5:31:05] Aphro_Samurai: sitback, relax, and pay activision its money lul

[5:31:14] tyrel_jones: To me, classic leveling was very relaxing. But thats just me
[5:31:26] Blvdman: @PadidinJones PepeHands prob once converted from usd to cad + tax prob will be 60$ CAD
[5:31:33] keenoberry: classic leveling is somehow more engaging than mythic+ to me
[5:31:59] Artivicii: @Konpacu o wait no its the other way around, u just need to buy the 60% flying before u finish the quest
[5:32:06] k1ngtmac: Hey tow. What are your thoughts about not having a gold cap? Wanted to get your opinion on this
[5:32:15] Artivicii: @Konpacu so its only like 1k, and then u do the questline

[5:33:09] Natureboyqq: amen brother

[5:33:17] MrKhanes: Indeed! Let them keep it, they worked for it.
[5:33:21] Khalio23: I agree
[5:33:23] flebbooo: that's fair, it's only really the boting at this point which is the issue
[5:33:45] flebbooo: keep seing bunch of rogues in brd boting gold all day

[5:36:21] 28jc: Kappa
[5:36:33] Sinamun1: i played classic from p1 got 30k gold atm and alot of mats i would be mad af if they make gold cap for tbc
[5:36:37] Aphro_Samurai: nah towel they have their gold, but this time around in TBC we using PLATINUM lul
[5:36:58] scottiepalmer: yea i agree with you boss i just started playing classic casually about a week ago and I have some 50g and I know for a fact I didnt have gold like that in real classic
[5:37:00] SyrothTV: yep gold cap would only hurt regular players
[5:37:04] Garylazereyess: A lot of the classic comminity buys gold now
[5:37:16] morp1onz: When TBC released the first time, did it come with a boost like the new expac when they launch ?
[5:37:23] scottiepalmer: we just play at a differnet time and most of you guys crying are apart of the problem and RMT anyways
[5:37:23] keenoberry: i feel like classic just has the bane of not having all the game design reworks they've done to combat botting through the years

[5:38:07] Nottinghams: it probably took me best part of 1 year to get max flying for 5k gold back then tho
[5:38:16] PuffyTheMagicalDragon: will TBC  have group finder? for like PVP and dungeons?
[5:38:21] vyjinx: didnt boost come with draenor or even later ?
[5:38:25] Blvdman: i think tbc to wotlk will be unholy amounts of profit
[5:38:27] Artivicii: @Nottinghams daaaam!!
[5:38:27] Sinamun1: @PuffyTheMagicalDragon no
[5:38:28] warrenny: Boosts started in legion right
[5:38:35] chrispape: ngl, If I didnt already level a few 60's in classic, Id be boosting
[5:38:39] Hank_ish: time to invest into stock
[5:38:52] mavericks312: and tbf BC won't touch the numbers classic wrath will pull in
[5:39:10] scottiepalmer: I will be honest I wish they wouldn't cater to that crowd and just let us play classic the way we wanted, I would like to see no boosts personally
[5:39:11] faulen: what addon manager do you use? Can it do Classic and Retail?
[5:39:14] Nottinghams: if you were raiding ever week, getting the 5k gold for max flying is not something could do in a week lol
[5:39:25] Dark_lite7: BC is a pretty popular expansion
[5:39:35] TweakT: it's gonna keep increasing until Wrath, my son
[5:39:37] blazingDrop: wotlk squad
[5:39:45] JayMoonTV: BC was a very popular exp
[5:39:45] HopeThePriest: people will legit quit retail forever to play bc, id stay in BC forever dude
[5:39:46] k1ngtmac: I love TBC
[5:39:46] Artivicii: TBC wasnt as popular as wotlk, but forsure it was better than wotlk
[5:39:50] synixdx: wotlk with be pog
[5:40:02] D_Embrace: BC is when raiding started getting good and PVP really kicked in with the areans
[5:40:03] scottiepalmer: haha i am actually playing BC for the exp but preping for wrath
[5:40:03] vyjinx: but what about ToC Kappa
[5:40:06] RodneyIsPro: ill play TBC for hype and when it goes down never touch again lol
[5:40:09] scottiepalmer: wrath was my true golden age
[5:40:10] drmabusee: ulduar was such a good raid
[5:40:11] keenoberry: heroic anub was actually a fun fight but fuck the rest of that raid
[5:40:18] Kyrrua: this blizzcon was weirdly focused on tbc, all the more with shadowlands not being ready. Then I saw the boost lvl 58 and I was like "oh, the money stars aligned and everything makes sense now"
[5:40:29] Nottinghams: they can stretch out tbc for more than 2 years too i think
[5:40:42] Armdel: Just the burning crusade arena experience alone would be enough for me
[5:40:54] 28jc: I'm in the "why not both" category. literally can't rank BC or WOTLK above each other
[5:41:06] keenoberry: hunting world buffs to not play my character most of the week killed classic for me
[5:41:10] AveragePvp: How many character copy’s are they allowing?
[5:41:17] Nottinghams: TBC has way more longevity
[5:41:19] Moxnix13: I want prenerf heroics
[5:41:26] scottiepalmer: wow really?
[5:41:29] faulen: @Towelliee what addon manager do you use? Can it do Classic and Retail?
[5:41:33] Artivicii: same, wotlk is somewhere in top 7
[5:41:34] Jairoy: wrath only good for ulduar lol
[5:41:34] scottiepalmer: can i ask why you dont like wrath ?
[5:41:35] I3Iackarrow: wrath was so bad
[5:41:49] scottiepalmer: i found out about you in wrath :)
[5:41:49] JokaThS: what is your top 5 exp ? @Towelliee
[5:41:51] k1ngtmac: BC is by far the best lol in my opinion
[5:41:55] Artivicii: wrath wasnt bad, it just wasnt BC good
[5:41:57] flebbooo: Isn't legion one of your favorite xpacs? Outside of tbc :)
[5:42:09] superxfire: What is his third fav xpac?
[5:42:09] KreyTrey: @towelliee whats your top 3 expansions?
[5:42:11] alluza: wrath is the best expac there was for me and tbc was not expac for me since thats when i started playing
[5:42:13] kalmenus1: But with wrath you had icc dance offs
[5:42:15] iunbearable: What happened to his camera?
[5:42:15] alluza: frozen throne
[5:42:16] Artivicii: reign of chaos
[5:42:17] Nottinghams: even when WOTLK released, the TBC servers will go on being active for years more than classic
[5:42:17] mavericks312: for me it's the Arthas story due to the older games
[5:42:20] BoNE_22: Wraths zones were pretty dope though as well...
[5:42:25] DreavT2K: because heirlooms Kappa
[5:42:28] D_Embrace: I loved TBC so much that i went hardcore in 1 of the top 10 guilds, cleared everything. Stopped and switched server and went to play with friends to clear everything from scratch again and i was never bored for a moment. It was that good in my opinion
[5:42:42] Lyffie80: wrath is first zoomer exp :D
[5:42:42] jerseyfive: arthas is warcraft
[5:42:44] TwentyAUT: DK Main since wotlk, thats why i Like wotlk, cause DK came out. Frost Tank ftw baby!
[5:42:52] angryhonkinggoose: BC> Wrath> Vanilla> Legion> Cataclysm> The rest
[5:42:56] Artivicii: illidan story was better imo, in wc3
[5:42:56] Valseki: !server

[5:43:01] Joryckfree: wrath was epic expansion good raids, perfect pvp
[5:43:03] iunbearable: !camera
[5:43:16] trillroot: Warcraft RTS = WoW Lore? n
[5:43:17] CritcobainTV: But Ulduar FeelsBadMan
[5:43:29] AveragePvp: I liked wrath because I got my first glad title lmao, flying in on a deadly gladiators frost wyrm when they were the only frost wyrms in the game, unmatched hahaha
[5:43:32] Artivicii: would make more sense if arthas was anduins father BabyRage
[5:43:34] 28jc: Yeah I loved wrath pvp personally. But I played disc priest so...
[5:43:36] mrrazputin: What are your top 5 raids overall in all expansions ?
[5:43:41] KreyTrey: @towelliee whats your top 3 expansions?
[5:43:45] Somakarma: Am I missing out if I don't do pvp or join a guild (in retail)?
[5:43:45] Nottinghams: yeah that's true. Even when classi Wrath is released, the legacy TBC servers will be so active still
[5:44:02] SyrothTV: @Towelliee i still think kael'thas got did dirty by the lore team...  pre sunwell he was prob the best char arc
[5:44:10] BBUUTTEERRSSS: BC, Legion and MoP is a solid list @Towelliee
[5:44:12] Ulfinator: Legion best imo
[5:44:14] CritcobainTV: You mean to tell me WoD isn't in your top 3? @Towelliee Kappa
[5:44:15] Artivicii: BC legion, now im somewhere inbetween mop and SL 4Head
[5:44:29] D_Embrace: the sunwell are for questing and pvping was awesome
[5:44:47] D_Embrace: Going there with a full PVPset as a 2.2k rating ret pally was melting people :D
[5:44:49] D_Embrace: I miss that
[5:45:04] Artivicii: honestly, with 9.1 releasing soon, SL might be better than mop
[5:45:35] Nottinghams: The Sunwell raid was released pretty late, most didn't have a good shot at it
[5:45:35] Artivicii: KEKW
[5:45:38] Reiumi_: PepeLaugh
[5:45:42] t0pgun_: KEKW

[5:46:42] mavericks312: what's CC lol
[5:46:49] 28jc: I liked the dungeon design in wrath, even if it was too easy
[5:46:52] firefly_on: 50 attempts ? wtf
[5:46:54] Artivicii: CC is closed captioning 4Head
[5:47:12] keenoberry: i feel like people are gonna be disappointed in TBC's difficulty
[5:47:38] Somakarma: Did you bother with pets in retail?
[5:47:48] SonofHorus82: aw Towelliee is a kitty!
[5:47:53] Artivicii: @keenoberry meh, the gear system and playstyle prevents "difficulty"
[5:47:53] D_Embrace: WOTLK introduced LFG, which in the opinion of a lot of people is where you started loosing the feeling of meeting and engaging with people. You'd get some random people, clear it and never meet them again.
[5:48:20] Ezekyler: but if they use the last patch on TBC the heroic dungeons are nerfed right?
[5:48:53] Sh4nti: Shadow labs WutFace
[5:48:54] 28jc: I know one thing, I can't wait to do some Halaa pvp
[5:48:54] Raest77: Shattered Halls 8))

[5:50:30] Nottinghams: gated behind rep and heroic keys for loot is good

[5:51:31] 28jc: I like how everyone in classic is obsessed with getting every world buff... and then they're like "waah it's too easy"
[5:51:38] Kyrrua: classic, back when bag space was important...
[5:51:42] Artivicii: @28jc KEKW
[5:51:43] raptorstrick: Can you skin
[5:51:54] 28jc: No more having to log out
[5:51:56] 28jc: to play
[5:52:01] DigitalChill: ugh no kidding the LFG spam in some classic realms is nothing but world buffs
[5:52:17] Artivicii: the world buffs in TBC were PVP related, the towers in hellfire and zangermarsh
[5:52:20] at1c: World buff meta one of the reasons to why I stopped playing classic
[5:52:20] keenoberry: casual guilds forcing world buff hunting KEKW
[5:52:36] 28jc: its cheese mode and I hate it
[5:52:36] flebbooo: D:

[5:53:31] D_Embrace: what about a rogue? :D
[5:53:32] Soulofdragon01: @Melexiz thanks, was thinking something health related
[5:53:35] Artivicii: shadowpriest FTW
[5:53:35] CritcobainTV: what about a warglaive rogue POGGERS
[5:53:44] Reiumi_: np!
[5:53:45] Orthobullet: Hmmm lock
[5:53:47] Serpzy: what's mage like in BC ? thinking of rolling from rogue to mage @towelliee

[5:54:40] Bazsidiver: bis in arena
[5:54:56] keenoberry: arcane needs t5 bonus
[5:54:56] xxcrazed25xx: mage was #4 dps
[5:54:57] CritcobainTV: Frost is better without gear, and then fire gets to be op
[5:55:03] Serpzy: always wanted to play fire so that's sweet :)
[5:55:04] Artivicii: yeah arcane was good in tier4, but tier5 and 6 was fire
[5:55:04] CritcobainTV: cause u can get icy veins
[5:55:06] Mugzly: Was enhancement shaman good in bc?
[5:55:06] izabeL: can someone link me that video?
[5:55:13] Kyrrua: mage is overshadowed by other classes in bc :(
[5:55:19] Immanis: Immanis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[5:55:20] Aphro_Samurai: if i remember right it was fire till t5 then it was arcane from then on, fire till SSC
[5:55:24] Moxnix13: Arcane needs an SP and a few innervates too
[5:55:25] Raidr211: mages are still high end dps any spec
[5:55:30] 28jc: I am just going to play mm hunter and snipe people from on top of mountains in av all day. that was my bc life
[5:55:37] SGT_SlapChop: Pallys and Druids were better tanks than warriors at T5 & T6
[5:55:37] Lasidor: spriest mana battery ftw
[5:55:43] Wholechin: what are shammys like in BC?
[5:55:48] pavepawns: u are actually lvling in classic?
[5:55:48] rizzllaa: wasnt arcanre too mana hungry ?
[5:55:49] at1c: @Mugzly Yes
[5:55:52] Kman3107: Arcane is for burst, isn't it?
[5:56:03] Artivicii: @Sgt_SlapChop true, but more like T5.5 lol
[5:56:09] Kman3107: Don't remember much arcane mages in raids
[5:56:11] jawnythompson: i want to play ret but all the talk about them still being shit kinda scares me
[5:56:12] Kyrrua: warlock top tier, priest mana regen, shaman dmg + totems
[5:56:24] Bazsidiver: but warriors have the best the mitigation
[5:56:29] DreavT2K: is arms warrior viable in bc?
[5:56:31] Artivicii: prot paladins rekt hyjal and BT
[5:56:39] Kyrrua: everything is viable in tbc
[5:56:46] DreavT2K: ok ty
[5:56:59] herzig85: rogues where sick dps in bc
[5:57:08] Bazsidiver: Kappa
[5:57:14] Novaht: @towelliee what do you think would be a recommended pc for WoW?
[5:57:19] Kyrrua: except if you are the 1% hardcore nolife raiders just play what u want
[5:57:19] at1c: based on my memory Paladin tanks where good anti magic tanks and Bears was the HP tank.
[5:57:21] Attackroot: arm warrior slam spec pve extremely gear dependent. better dps on fury anway
[5:57:21] Lasidor: evasion tanking rogues!
[5:57:33] imjorman: What's a good resource for this pre-raid gear lists for BC?
[5:57:40] KaisenSiru: vixenSELLOUT

[5:58:30] Artivicii: took until T5+ for rogues to get max hit rating tho
[5:58:42] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee I've been thinking about getting into streaming. I've heard a lot of streamers talk about having a separate "streaming PC". Is it necessary to have a separate streaming PC?
[5:58:43] Daddyknut: could dwarfs be paladins in tbc or did that came later?
[5:58:48] destinopt: Yo Towelliee ever happened to you that when ur picking intems from vault u close it to come back later now they all dissapeared ? and I know I didnt pick stygia cause I have no key

[6:05:41] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee i came back to classic on my other realm i had 200g at level 20, it was during the AQ war effort and copper / peacebloom prices were INSANE

[6:31:59] ideate_: I know they haven't released a time slot for tbc so I'm assuming they haven't released a time slot for that time frame where you can level a BE or draenai before TBC release?

[6:33:13] Thunderbrew: So TBC Classic and 9.1 Raid at the same time?
[6:33:24] mankatsui: why talking about leveling right now? what sense of this
