[2:53:30] BlueNeoh: @Deadge_Gartic Even then I'd just take Frostfire for an Elemental spec rather than deep Fire spec
[2:53:38] Druntico: If you save it for thursday then you'll get some increased EXP from it as well
[2:53:45] listrel1: yesh
[2:53:46] Deadge_Gartic: @BlueNeoh i mean it all depends on the value of pyro tbh

[2:55:37] 5hourandy: https://streamable.com/4rbch6
[2:56:01] BlueNeoh: @Deadge_Gartic For Elemental spec yeah, for deep frost it depends on how good Spellfrost is

[3:12:18] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic Early prog 90 pulls is like 1 raid night since everything one shots and you need to wait til tanks and healers stop one shotting everyone om
[3:12:28] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 yeah exactly LULW
[3:12:43] FurylordD: just do what azamous does and put every keybinding as sunder armor
[3:12:43] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 tindral is like 20 to 30 hours progress miss me with that shit
[3:13:08] FurylordD: like when he has chaos bolt as every keybinding
[3:13:09] Deadge_Gartic: i cbted pre nerf halondrus and anduin before
[3:13:10] Deadge_Gartic: never again
[3:13:15] isharpsword: do you watch awc savix?
[3:13:36] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic It got nerfed hard, 3 bombs and 12 seeds that you can't wipe raid with is a big game changer
[3:13:54] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 yeah i heard that
[3:13:55] misomander: no ive been killed thjree times
[3:13:57] misomander: by horde
[3:14:09] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 still that boss in release state gave so bad taste that i rather skip ce this tier
[3:14:18] Deadge_Gartic: i dont wanna progress that
[3:14:33] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic Pre-nerf Sepulcher as a whole was cbt
[3:14:51] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 yeah it was thats also why i quit after anduin that tier
[3:14:51] Madwo: smugalanaKEKW
[3:14:59] Grubjaw: gotta be under right

[3:15:16] StreamElements: Check out the Best VPN Surfshark -> https://surfshark.deals/SavixVPN
[3:15:24] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 weirdly those arent even the hardest raids they did , tomb of sargeras was next level cbt but more enjoyable
[3:15:31] LukeAaron413: seatbelts pog
[3:15:48] LukeAaron413: TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[3:15:54] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic My guild at the time died at Halondrus and then I joined one that had just killed Anduin, so I skipped the cbt and got my first CE EZ Clap
[3:16:17] FurylordD: hes in bfd pretty sure
[3:16:23] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 Clapgers at that time i was in a t600 guild
[3:16:24] sorkolik: hey when is sod dropping
[3:16:25] sorkolik: p2
[3:16:30] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 disbanded after anduin LULW
[3:16:32] squishalan: 4 days
[3:16:39] doubled09: AlienCapoeira
[3:16:40] the_bronze_yasuo: i heard you tried dungeonborne whatd you think of it? PogU
[3:16:41] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 lots of guilds quit during sepulcher
[3:16:42] sorkolik: is tehre point of playing if i didnt play sod already
[3:17:09] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic Can't speak for raids prior to SL, but I think what sucked in Sepulcher was how much micro-management and one shots there were, every boss was a WA nightmare
[3:17:22] CamGG__: SoD barely started
[3:17:39] Grashh: There is a lot of catch up gear as well it seems they are adding so you arent behind in that regard either
[3:17:48] Lilithintent: sod Hype sod Hype morningperson
[3:17:58] brakealot: you could probably start in 2 months and still not be behind
[3:17:59] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 problem was we had hard raids before but they were engaging fights  talking about halondrus , that fight was so simple on paper but so fkng unforgiving
[3:18:00] squishalan: @sorkolik if u wanna play alot your prob gonna have alts anyway so might as well start now
[3:18:05] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 not really engaging
[3:18:32] cptjohnnnn: Hey Savix is it sad melee havent figured out how to dodge all of gelihasts phases by just standing behind him LOL
[3:18:34] Deadge_Gartic: also whoever thought 6 second bombs was a good idea
[3:18:35] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic Halondrus was a banger fight up to heroic. That single bomb mechanic made the whole fight trash
[3:18:40] Deadge_Gartic: should get fired
[3:19:04] Discsohard: im making a new toon and my first one is 24 quit b4 i even got to 25
[3:19:14] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 i mean not only that tbh , every single ability 1 shotting LULW range just ignores everything by staying out of range and warrior charge was broken which made me hate it 3x more
[3:19:24] jtstroud: om
[3:19:26] Deadge_Gartic: @Kurama__95 when i charged into the boss i was charging in his zone lmao
[3:19:30] Kleik__: another bfd ? BirdgeLeave
[3:19:33] Deadge_Gartic: and getting 1 shot
[3:19:48] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic Classic Blizzard pathing OM
[3:20:07] cptjohnnnn: i got mad i didnt get 3 set and 2h so i rq the game on my ret
[3:20:16] Kleik__: yea i've seen part where every exp was S tier LULW
[3:20:22] Deadge_Gartic: @Kleik_bor om
[3:20:33] Kurama__95: @Deadge_Gartic What I remember most about that fight was that I progged during the same period hunters were bugged and autoshotting at random, so we'd have so many ninja pulls it was driving me insane OM

[3:25:15] OrkanenTV: @OrkanenTV Oh I had no idea. Well then it might not matter all that much.
[3:25:18] Koopa_Troopa000: SSF?
[3:25:26] johnnypoison69: nah fam sod 100%
[3:25:30] Mythirun: im just tired of classic wow
[3:25:31] wreckstormx: Cant ressurect so no
[3:25:34] Mythirun: savixArzondir
[3:25:38] goatsiez: sod is way more fun
[3:25:43] Seejay52: what is SSF
[3:25:48] Grashh: Only reason i played hc was because it had people out and about doing stuff and wow lacked that for a long time with raid logging. Sod fills that for me now so no point
[3:25:49] RenegaidenJay: @Koopa_Troopa000 Solo Self Found, you can only use items you get yourself or create yourself
[3:25:53] Mythirun: hel hel hell no
[3:25:56] Mythirun: insani162Smile
[3:26:05] cptjohnnnn: retail < SOD

[3:26:25] tw1ZTER: like masturbation?
[3:26:36] YzieGG: wait 3 month KEKW
[3:26:56] Mythirun: watching classic for 2 years damaged my brain than raiding in retail
[3:27:01] Mythirun: savixDespair
[3:27:02] tellmeagainiforgot: you mean me spamming starsurge and moonfire from 41 yards away isnt skillful? :(
[3:27:04] cptjohnnnn: its legit scissors paper rock

[3:27:16] cptjohnnnn: moonkin broken
[3:27:28] cptjohnnnn: and if you tell a moonkin they are broken they rage and call you bad hahaha
[3:27:35] Deadge_Gartic: meh you do no damage in raid you should be good for pvp at least
[3:27:42] Deadge_Gartic: thats the trade off i guess
[3:27:52] Mythirun: oh shit
[3:27:53] johnnypoison69: 1 more lockout!! ;)
[3:27:54] goochyboi: mealth
[3:27:59] cptjohnnnn: dps in raid really doesnt matter though
[3:28:01] goochyboi: om
[3:28:05] Seejay52: always waitin on @SpicymisoTV
[3:28:06] misomander: bro they keep opening trade
[3:28:07] Mythirun: war within alpha coming next month or 2
[3:28:07] misomander: and taking it all
[3:28:11] Mythirun: Wokege
[3:28:15] Deadge_Gartic: @cptjohnnnn some people doesnt really care about pvp either
[3:28:17] fiepo: I did the raid today. I still need my spell power necklace and epic staff... I guess it'll never happen
[3:28:18] wreckstormx: Dps in raid is whats fun
[3:28:24] Deadge_Gartic: @cptjohnnnn thats kinda no ending arguement
[3:28:47] FurylordD: damage?
[3:28:55] cptjohnnnn: @Deadge_Gartic in SOD raid? its clearable without even being geared
[3:29:10] cptjohnnnn: doesnt work the other way around for PVP
[3:29:11] squishalan: Akumai
[3:29:13] Deadge_Gartic: @cptjohnnnn thats not the point tho
[3:29:16] YzieGG: murky ult YEP

[3:29:52] FurylordD: they're all boring at this point
[3:29:53] Deadge_Gartic: @cptjohnnnn i mean unfortunately none of the versions of wow has any proper balancing
[3:29:55] Z3ND0G: Shadow Realm
[3:30:01] cptjohnnnn: also logging raid for SOD is beyond sad
[3:30:05] squishalan: the trick is to go in with the feral so u keep windfury
[3:30:10] Mythirun: When is sod season done
[3:30:12] Deadge_Gartic: @cptjohnnnn and not everyone plays both pve and pvp games no matter how easy or hard it is

[3:30:42] creaturesfan72: those robes havent dropped for me in 16 lock outs NOOOOOOOOOO
[3:30:55] Deadge_Gartic: @cptjohnnnn my point is 1 class sucking on 1 type of activity being good at other is the kinda trade off blizzard making for like 20 years
