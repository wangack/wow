[1:18:17] facerolljack: 9.0.2 probably
[1:18:17] Pufendorf99: Is it as good idea to get the Nathanos weapondrop for every char or will the gearing up be ok even if you have poor gear in the expansion?
[1:18:19] tr4ncetv: prep probably
[1:18:29] fewyn: patch tomorrow probably?

[1:23:46] The_Tyrannical_Talkboxx: its not the loot its the timer
[1:23:48] hierophants: the fact that shoulders/cloaks drop from the rares is kind of lazy imo

[1:43:32] keeindordel: its boring af y do i want to repeat the same god damn dungeouns but in a more difficult annoying way its a god damn chore having to farm for it to "gear" for mythic raiding its dumb af
[1:43:33] mpmhall: Do you think Timewalking, which falls on December 1, will offer a good piece of gear Towelliee?

[1:44:42] PadidinJones: Dude your DH warglieves look oversized af
[1:44:43] keeindordel: MYTHIC raiding gear should be the only best raid gear possible mythic+ should only be the middle line between heroic and mythic
[1:44:46] Thunderbrew: @keeindordel so don't play that part of the expansion. Problem solved.
[1:45:05] keeindordel: @Thunderbrew no not problem solved i HAVE to since im a CE raider

[1:46:38] keeindordel: im not trolling
[1:46:40] Zestusuka: People know bears are strong
[1:47:00] Zestusuka: I think Brew is the dark horse for the early expansion. They haven't gotten much attention
[1:47:00] NightsageOP: Yea Bear will be the best for M+ without a doubt.

[1:51:42] pereadin: In legion it took me 3 weeks after mythic launch to get the 15 achieve and that’s with pushing it hard when I was alliance.
[1:51:54] Masqerader: Blizzard always finds away to kill its most popular things
[1:51:59] pereadin: So 10 is definitely doable week 1

[1:57:23] keeindordel: like im hoenstly debating ove rit... like i know for warrior best covenant is venthyr 2nd is kyrian.. but since my class is already crap in dps no matter what i do debating if i should just go necrolord and focus more on buffing my entire raid ;/ @Towelliee
[1:57:35] exodog4: Kreygasm
[1:57:51] mysteriousm4n: I'm thinking about picking up a healer alt trying to pick between disc with the ability to go shadow and resto with the ability to go ele NotLikeThis
[1:58:05] SRDraven: Which covenant are rogues going?
[1:58:12] keeindordel: necro
[1:58:17] Raidr211: my healer is resto sham. not sure what dps ill off spec
[1:58:23] bassit: Yo chat does anyone knows where i can get this ui?
[1:58:30] NightsageOP: all i know is im ready to level my druid to 60. DROOD4LIFE
[1:58:31] amricatt: !ui
[1:58:32] Moobot: We have a new, updated Towelliee SL UI! | wowinterface.com/downloads/info23265-TowellieesTankUIElvUI169.html READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY OR IT WONT WORK.

[1:58:34] keeindordel: @SRDraven almost all of them like tht bonespike
[1:58:36] rottisxd: you literally dont
[1:58:40] Kromede: EZ
[1:58:42] idenkaz_: KEKW
[1:58:43] mysteriousm4n: Raidr211 I'd probably just go ele so you don't have to have 2 gear sets personally
[1:58:47] pedrodepacas1: you just lack dedication ;)
[1:58:53] SRDraven: @keeindordel I thought they nerfed it
[1:58:55] keilosh: @Towelliee hey towelie hella respect the grind, any idea when ur hittin the next football stream
[1:58:59] bassit: @Amricatt thanks man :D
[1:59:07] keeindordel: @SRDraven pretty sure its still good
[1:59:10] Chi_Tsumi: @clairlouise secretlabs i think, not sure about a code
[1:59:12] Raidr211: @mysteriousm4n yeah i am thinking the same thing
[1:59:15] mysteriousm4n: only 6 choices a week lol
[1:59:24] keilosh: oh never mind sorry
[1:59:27] keilosh: :(
[1:59:30] tnhorrorfan: pft lucky if i get one choice a week
[1:59:31] Clicklesly: Wont you feel like you wasted your time anyway whenever you pick an item in the first column?
[1:59:33] dengueuk: @Towelliee trying to keep more than 2 toons up on cache would cause burn out fast
[1:59:41] Seerated: You can bet someone will try though, get hospitalized in teh process
[1:59:41] tnhorrorfan: only have like 3-4 hours a week anymore to play lol
[1:59:41] R2RHIN0: I have a feeling they will lower the number of M+ dungeons required each week as the expansion goes on. It just seems way too high
[1:59:53] Collected1: meaningful choices
[1:59:55] pedrodepacas1: would you say the choice was meaningful
[2:00:02] facerolljack: PvP Cache is useless anyways if you aren't high rating
[2:00:05] mysteriousm4n: getting no choice on 4 charcters > 4 choices
[2:00:11] mysteriousm4n: 4 times the gear
[2:00:21] rottisxd: yeah and in current system you can easily keep up alts in mythic gear
[2:00:26] tonixx619: @Towelliee sup my dude
[2:00:26] B3PB3P: Do you only get to pick one out of the 9 items? Or do you get to pick one from each category
[2:00:26] Bugszy: i9t was alwaays not an upgrade or a duplicate lol
[2:00:41] othraerir: did they add the currency on beta if you didn't want to pick an item?
[2:00:45] Collected1: i want to hear from Ion. It's been a while since we've heard his voice.
[2:01:01] B3PB3P: Ah okay thanks
[2:01:02] adeekoowy: Outlaw is good in Shadowlands? Or warlock i a better choice?
[2:01:03] Eshel: Well since I don’t PvP it narrows it down to 6 choices lol
[2:01:08] dengueuk: 10 wanst it
[2:01:11] Stargazer27: Best system in Shadowlands is targeted fps - everything is sooo smooth now
[2:01:21] bassit: Man i've fallen in love with prot pally so much fun
[2:01:23] facerolljack: its 3 ilvl
[2:01:31] silent5nipess: why is it a maintenance
