[0:26:34] Bioaim7: @nicolai_original first of all, priest healing in pve is also ridiculous, so the change is good, and pvp modifiers are just shit
[0:26:37] Trales1: NO CHANGES ReallyMad
[0:26:37] Quelibrio: to e homest beast mastery rune was way op
[0:26:38] smordan69: Apparently they cant, because its the same client as HC and era

[0:26:43] simonromlie: Warrior will be the best DPS even without any runes since they are not gonna change the core game xdd
[0:26:46] jon66jon66: KEKInsane
[0:26:50] xmarcaurelx: So basically, shadow priests are useless and holy priests are just a little bit better than every other heal class. Why playing this class in the first place now?

[0:29:26] xmarcaurelx: Still, playing a priest right now sucks. You only play shadow priest for solo content and holy priest is just one option instead of THE option.

[0:29:33] nicolai_original: Just do " preist healing runes now do 20% less healing in pvp combat" @JokerdTV
[0:29:34] tedi95: @JokerdTV all they had to do was increase mana cost of rune spells for priests and it was fine
[0:29:34] hejez: make penance cost mana
[0:29:38] salk76: @nicolai_original this
[0:29:39] wesjah: imagine damping in raid
[0:29:44] HeligeOlga: fucking blizzard. killing the priest class

[0:31:09] Bioaim7: @nicolai_original yes and how you define "pvp combat" as a healer?
[0:31:15] Bedreten: Would be PVP flagged bug all over again KEKL
[0:31:17] salk76: but then initial healing would be based
[0:31:20] nicolai_original: @Bioaim7 if u heal a player in pvp combat lol
[0:31:24] Fizbane89: Just make it to where theres no knockback then
[0:31:32] wesjah: what if your pvping open world and being attacked by a mob aswel. Wil it scale back and forth then?
[0:31:39] Bioaim7: @nicolai_original ?? how do you define pvp combat in open world?
[0:31:43] realpan114: and hunters still play sod,a fter literally chaanging them every week
[0:31:46] realpan114: like its dumb
[0:31:47] fumanchu899: their pet is 1v1 aother classes, i think they know
[0:31:51] mikimoharadras: I think the change is good for hunters, it will allow to build more interessting builds, instead of only having beast mastery viable
[0:31:53] calmazing: just delete hunters from the game
[0:31:58] nicolai_original: @Bioaim7 are you 10iq, if u are hitting another player its pvp combat lol

[0:33:23] ammar1121: @JokerdTV which server  should i choose ? making my first char in SOD ;q

[0:34:06] bleezy16: DUGA
[0:34:06] theradoor: I like that they nerfed pets, but scaled dmg overall for abilities.. And that they nerfed priest healing. The healer runes were way too OP compared to other classes.
[0:34:09] tedi95: just play an off meta class/spec and you wont get hit by the nerf hammer
