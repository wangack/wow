[1:22:48] huckleson: they dont care about pvp lol
[1:22:54] DeathToad007: f aggrend this is most shitty answer
[1:23:02] SurrealAndre: you shouldn’t have to make a premade to play a BG
[1:23:20] berserage95: man i love blizzard, this was a problem in retail and they fixed it but now its a problem again and he acts like its a new problem LUL
[1:23:21] RudyRube: Just dont allow premades in AB.  Easy
[1:23:24] DeathToad007: he just says we dont want to screw over premade players with alonger queue get fucked noobs
[1:23:27] huckleson: every single pvp game has a way to solo queue
[1:23:32] Xgeonmar: yup hour long AV queue KEKW
[1:23:34] huckleson: and its the main way to queue
[1:23:38] wavecadet: make the premade que have incentive...
[1:23:39] jonathanwreeede: Premade = against solos. Solo que= against premades.
[1:23:41] wavecadet: extra rep for premade vs premade
[1:23:43] Fredthegred: they should just ban premades
[1:23:43] wavecadet: easy fix
[1:23:45] RudyRube: Force AB to have no premades, then u have a choice
[1:23:45] feed_the_kitty: It's not just a Horde thing. I've had plenty of situations with Horde Pre-mades that steam roll my pug. tis what it tis
[1:23:46] Velxir: 'We wont solve the problem now because it might be a problem later' seenms like a poor excuse
[1:23:50] hutchyy917: premade v premade is fun. make it seperate
[1:23:51] daerbgge: so? thats a problem with pvp popularity
[1:23:52] wavecadet: Yes
[1:23:53] DeathToad007: yes
[1:23:54] wavecadet: Thats fine
[1:23:56] Goated_Goods: Only WSG out right now though
[1:23:56] huckleson: YES
[1:23:57] Legendary_Wish: who cares if premade ques never pop? Problem solved. Everyone ques solo

[1:23:58] Leviosor: yes

[1:24:00] tandre92: NOO
[1:24:00] DeathToad007: yes plz
[1:24:00] lHlUlLlK: YES KILL THE PREMADES
[1:24:01] konda138: just cap premade at 5man
[1:24:01] pattythepaladin: @berserage95 I queued into the same premade 5 times last night
[1:24:04] DeathToad007: it will
[1:24:07] huckleson: who cares about premade its not like premade is some sick game mode. its literally pug stomping and its not fun
[1:24:11] lHlUlLlK: FUCK PREMADES
[1:24:12] tandre92: NOOO WHAT IN THE WORLD
[1:24:13] FurylordD: @Xgeonmar just join premade av groups
[1:24:16] DeathToad007: douche bag response
[1:24:16] pattythepaladin: on retail
[1:24:17] berserage95: how about make it like retail and max 5 people in a party queue? why are we trying to fix a problem that has already been fixed LUL
[1:24:23] the_swanz: the_swanz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:24:24] ezeebzee: limit premade size to size of regular party?
[1:24:27] daerbgge: literally is the simplest solution ever lol
[1:24:33] huckleson: premade are not worth killing solo queue at all
[1:24:33] hutchyy917: cool communication but hes doing what HE wants and not community
[1:24:33] DeathToad007: they sent me a survey and i lit ths reponse up
[1:24:34] Cant0n: Good honesty to recognize  this game has always been about playing with others
[1:24:35] SurrealAndre: F premades and the sweaty neckbeards that love them
[1:24:44] blazzedzz: Please kill pre mades I just want to q up and play man
[1:24:44] oprawindfurytv: I made a dope video, hope he watches it
[1:24:46] DeathToad007: suck my balls aggrend
[1:24:47] Saturos47: lazy answer imo. they could have seperated the queues and if down the line the queues were bad, merged it back into 1 queue again
[1:24:52] Fredthegred: just find a premade yourself 4Head
[1:24:54] macjcool: The shitty thing about Pre Mades is that htey are super specific about what classes they want. They all want 2 hunter and 2 priest
[1:24:57] evrgamerr: his argument is kinda bogus - you offer separate que's and when they don't pop - combine them.
[1:25:01] Skewed_OW: @berserage95 true, easy solution
[1:25:01] shelk_hs: queues are already 7 mins long
[1:25:09] galak321: no, it would be better to be able to que only at 5-man in wsg
[1:25:10] DeathToad007: incetinvise premade queues with loot or some shit i dont care
[1:25:14] hutchyy917: it's not a problem
[1:25:17] iStrudderz: that just means the server is dead and who really cares at that point
[1:25:20] daerbgge: solo ques wont be long. premades love pvp right? should be fine right?
[1:25:20] willyg701: 20 min ques lol
[1:25:20] ddevillax: check the clip in season of discovery channel, the 4th sodcore bfd is in there
[1:25:21] tandre92: @DeathToad007 this
[1:25:22] berserage95: bro this was a problem in retail and it was fixed how the fuck is this a convo LUL
[1:25:23] demonzhunter: nah
[1:25:24] Goated_Goods: I will take an hour Q like retail if it yields a real match
[1:25:24] zyl88: the thing is... all those cringy premade players wont play premade when they only face premades
[1:25:24] willyg701: laughs in solos huffle
[1:25:25] seven__h: Queues will also stop popping if people stop playing solo
[1:25:26] lHlUlLlK: I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME BY MYSELF I DONT WANT TO FOR A GROUP EVERYTIME I LOG IN
[1:25:26] DeathToad007: it is not better
[1:25:27] sgohst: then revert it at that point…
[1:25:27] demonzhunter: just make premades
[1:25:27] winningfob: better than a premade vs randoms
[1:25:28] aujewinashoe: when its 10v10, makes sense to split them. 40v40 premades are likely going to just be private communities or guild groups and prob wouldnt pop as often as the 10v10
[1:25:28] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: slippery slope argument imo
[1:25:29] targon_innos: Only premade ques will be long, nobody cares about that KEKW
[1:25:30] etcdev: i would rather have them add this and have it fail then never change anything though
[1:25:32] thetosis: So we cant revert if it doesnt work?
[1:25:33] Adurroo: What if you queue in smaller groups?
[1:25:34] stormlightcookie: Barney64 :)
[1:25:35] Munklebear: lol just build in a max timer where solos get put against premades when > 20 min queues. easy.  blizz loves excuses
[1:25:40] HafthorJake: @Xaryu whats the picture? the win%
[1:25:42] scavraider_301: perfer to not pop at all then pop and lose
[1:25:42] huckleson: 10+ minutes longer queue is worth not wasting 15minutes vs a premade
[1:25:43] L0pedogg: Retail Solo shuffle ques, like 40 min wait no one pvp anymore
[1:25:44] sgohst: you kinda drinking their cool aid a little

[1:25:46] DeathToad007: big L my man,. their worse response yet
[1:25:47] hutchyy917: i mean, i kind of feel ignored rather than abandoned with that post from aggrend
[1:25:48] galak321: no, it would be better to be able to que only at 5-man in wsg. You can set a limitation to the bgs queue and allowing it to not que more than 5 ppl
[1:25:49] huckleson: aggrend's takes were really dumb and out of touch tbh
[1:25:53] Javansi: Make 5 player max. queue for a bg instead of 10
[1:25:58] lurkerl0l: KEKW
[1:26:01] oprawindfurytv: It’s a real video
[1:26:04] oprawindfurytv: I made ut
[1:26:07] berserage95: people talk about the devs and sod like wow hasnt been around for 20 years lol fixing problem that have already been fixed
[1:26:07] oprawindfurytv: It
[1:26:08] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: IDK if it really is that hard to just reverse the split queues if they are just taking that long
[1:26:08] RudyRube: @huckleson Yeah theres already a functional 30 minute queue bc you have to queue and lose 3 times to get a good game
[1:26:12] jewellchris24: They should just make the benefit of solo queing worth it
[1:26:14] oprawindfurytv: Myself
[1:26:16] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: It's almost a false dilemma
[1:26:18] FurylordD: so xaryu, did someone say you were going to watch barny?
[1:26:18] AbejiSE: Well, why does it matter if it doesnt pop? just shows that not even premades wanna play against other premades
[1:26:20] huckleson: premade is not some sick thing worth protecting. Its not fun pvp gameplay at all lmfao
[1:26:25] tandre92: so think about it, people are advocating to destroy group play (premades) in pvp. the solution should be, improve the pvp, so that more want to go. dont nuke 2 or 3 friends wanting to play together

[1:26:33] inspect4: barrrrnnnyyy
[1:26:33] swizurp: anyone that says it HAS to be two que’s.. only cares about their experience right now and will likely probably not even be playing in 4-5 months. hence the exact problem with splitting up que’s down the line
[1:26:34] inspect4: lesgo

[1:27:45] RickPhilip: @ElectricSpice I feel ya...this also happened to me when I was doing machine shoulder presses. I'd say try and switch out the specific exercise that you feel is the cause, and if the issue persists, you might want to consider doing front delt targeted exercises earlier on in your upper body day. Cable front raises with a 2-3 sec tempo in the eccentric phase will get you good.

[1:40:06] norreybooambeat: Dmg Tab show all dmg done by all groups
[1:40:06] Tridos_: but its a damage parse
[1:40:07] howtowinyt: you are in the 77th percentile of people dealing damage with your druid @Xaryu
[1:40:07] Dextergg: that's because your healing was dogshit
[1:40:08] async00: one is dmg done one is healing done
[1:40:09] adam_brisbane: damage as a healer and healing as a healer
[1:40:09] miciahclay: Healing AS a healer was not so good
[1:40:11] Bivianus: damage as a healer , healer as a healer
[1:40:11] opalwinfrey: Damage done as a healer
[1:40:11] ruzxd: its how good dmg u did even tho ur a healer
[1:40:12] Huntos: damage is damage you did as a HEALER spec
[1:40:12] Mefi1988: u are healer
[1:40:13] coralgas: it switches back to overall instead of bracket
[1:40:13] samm8te: Damage good , healing bad
[1:40:13] Valzen22: @Xaryu its "healing done"
[1:40:14] GGunni: your spec is healer - how good damage you do as a healer
[1:40:14] soGGy69waFFle: damage parse vs healing parse
[1:40:15] Arandur87: You did good dmg for a healer but sucked at healing^^
[1:40:15] panzmat: @Xaryu first tab shows dps, so if you're a healer it'll compare you to other healers
[1:40:16] Doimos89: damage is damage
[1:40:17] aujewinashoe: DAMAGE AS A HEALER WAS GOOD, HEALING AS A HEALER WAS BAD
[1:40:19] Niccolo55: you did great damage as a healing
[1:40:19] Cjpriest: you didn’t heal lol
[1:40:20] shadador: @Xaryu  Damage is Damage done, healing is healing done
[1:40:21] espi: Damage tab shows your damage parse. Healing tab shows your healing parse
[1:40:21] shabomination: Damage tab is everyones dps parses. It just breaks up peopole by role
[1:40:21] Doimos89: healing is heal9ing
[1:40:22] marvinmc420: @Xaryu So you were healer, most healers do trash dmg , so your parses were high cause most healers ahve low dmg
[1:40:22] jikorax: Healers = healing, Dmg on healer = Dmg
[1:40:23] trindet: You did good damage as a healer, but bad healing. Compared to the overall playerbase
[1:40:23] fishb0mb: Leaf icon means your score is considered as a healer spec
[1:40:25] GGunni: yes
[1:40:25] Huntos: yes
[1:40:26] thenipple420: DAMAGE DONE AS RESTO SPEC
[1:40:26] Dextergg: YES
[1:40:26] 1shabbymn: @Xaryu  it's treating you as resto so you're parsing against other resto druids
[1:40:27] Mefi1988: u are flaggt as a healer
[1:40:28] adam_brisbane: correct
[1:40:29] Mairahh: exactly
[1:40:29] trindet: YES
[1:40:29] Tiliathh: @Xaryu you have near gilded damage parses, but you didnt contribute as much as a healer healing.
[1:40:30] Twisterase: yes
[1:40:30] aujewinashoe: correct
[1:40:30] caypr: yes
[1:40:31] shabomination: yes
[1:40:31] forthebored: YES
[1:40:32] athalon: YES
[1:40:33] Niccolo55: HE CAN LEARN
[1:40:34] shadador: yes
[1:40:34] capitallius: right, cuz youre in DAMAGE tab. right.
[1:40:34] Mahca_: dps parse as healer spec
[1:40:34] Porkypine666: correct
[1:40:35] Huntos: its the healers DPS
[1:40:36] Dextergg: yep
[1:40:36] Mairahh: healer is just your role
[1:40:36] jimmyhoppadom: Click on "By Bracket"
[1:40:37] Tinkeyyyy: Yes its your DPS compared to other resto druids
[1:40:39] Klopernikus: damage = damage done, healing = healing done
[1:40:40] Mefi1988: YES!!!
[1:40:45] Lamspread: Kappa
[1:40:46] miciahclay: but its not your dps parse right, just dps as a healer spec
[1:40:47] Acework: dmg compared to other healers dmg
[1:40:47] async00: yes
[1:40:47] panzmat: correct
[1:40:48] Tiliathh: Yes
[1:40:54] samm8te: beacuse you were dpsing
[1:40:56] deepfriedbrainforlunch: 1 KEKW
[1:40:57] async00: healing parses are fake anyway
[1:40:57] jimmyhoppadom: Click on "By Bracket" when on the Healing tab.
[1:40:58] espi: LUL
[1:40:59] Mairahh: KEKW
[1:41:00] yarrpeter: KEKW
[1:41:01] Goldenb0y7: lmfao
[1:41:01] Mefi1988: healing sucks but u are good in dmg as a healer
[1:41:01] Porkypine666: healing is fine
[1:41:01] Cant0n: KEKW
[1:41:02] aujewinashoe: LUL
[1:41:03] thenipple420: you used wildgrowth thats how it knows your a healer
[1:41:03] FurylordD: i mean after all you were a dps
[1:41:04] caypr: KEKW
[1:41:05] Libertas09: #1! YAYY
[1:41:05] Huntos: na jwubb has a 0 lol
[1:41:05] marvinmc420: Jwub had 0 LUL
[1:41:06] noxielle: 1 percentile Pog
[1:41:07] Senzar1337: not 0 so not worst
[1:41:11] Porkypine666: healing parse doesnt mean shit
[1:41:13] chron96: probably you didnt need to heal that much but you carried on kelris @Xaryu
[1:41:13] evrgamerr: Ironically, SOD HC makes you analyze logs - parse, cause phase 2 is so close
[1:41:16] howtowinyt: its what percentile by class you are in damage/healing done
[1:41:19] jimmyhoppadom: Click on "By Bracket" when on the healing tab.
[1:41:21] espi: healing parse = raid took a bunch of damage parse @Xaryu
[1:41:26] Aaoax: healing parse puke
[1:41:34] async00: yes, thats why healing parses are fake
[1:41:34] miciahclay: that's why healing parses are bad
[1:41:34] Porkypine666: good parse = bad group
[1:41:35] Kenithal: yeah parses probably 1 and 2 heal
[1:41:35] ben_heals_homies: Are there a lot of people playing resto druid in sod?
[1:41:36] ddevillax: it measures ur gearscore aswell so ur number is compared to people with same gearscore as u
[1:41:37] aujewinashoe: fair point made
[1:41:39] kallebalik: healing parse is a meme
[1:41:40] EX_Skenn: healing parses don't mean much, you get good parse when people take unecessary damage/cut healers
[1:41:41] fakeGrimes: good grp= crap healing parse
[1:41:43] miciahclay: bc your team needs to take damage lol
[1:41:46] Tinkeyyyy: Its hard to top heal parse unless solo healing
[1:41:46] espi: good heal parse means bad group stood in fire
[1:41:47] m3nkind: You can look at guzu hjealing its not that high too
[1:41:49] ShingaTV: KEKW
[1:41:51] TheRainMan17: LUL
[1:41:53] athalon: Healing parses barely matter tbh. Most ppl fudge them by one healing for big parses
[1:41:56] apexariestv: full wipe first boss with Mitch
[1:41:58] AnviThirteen: yeah playing SoD without wildstrikes and melee is kinda abysmal, especially as a warrior
[1:42:01] Kenithal: a good group would never parse
[1:42:04] NekoTheSpook010: Guzu did well for first time raid healing
[1:42:04] Kenithal: yes
[1:42:04] Perrjs: Hi everyone!
[1:42:05] evrgamerr: The stars aligned despite the deaths - great run
[1:42:05] async00: exactly
[1:42:06] Tiliathh: @Xaryu Honestly dont even pay attention to parses. Its just a good way to analyze what you can do better for future runs. Healer parse doesnt mean shit, damage parse is important but as a healer not as important.
[1:42:08] Senzar1337: or solo heal
[1:42:08] Dextergg: yes
[1:42:10] shadador: Or you can run one healer
[1:42:11] Porkypine666: thats it
[1:42:11] ImtherealJohnny: yes
[1:42:12] GrimShady99: EXPLAIN THAT TO MY GUILD
[1:42:12] Mangzatron: shitty group or drop healers
[1:42:14] thenipple420: Legit went over the same thing with your mage logs
[1:42:16] samm8te: best healers just go for dps parses
[1:42:17] merq: u have to solo it
[1:42:17] gruviman2: you have to Solo heal for paraes
[1:42:18] dingerdoom: parses are stupid anyway, not jsut the healing ones
[1:42:18] jacksunson: check the healing dispells
[1:42:20] berserage95: parses in anything but retail is dumb af LUL
[1:42:23] numbyooo: as long as no one dies you are a 100% good healer i guess
[1:42:27] focalized: @GrimShady99 clip it and link it to them lol
[1:42:31] paladan_tich: @Tiliathh healers with high dmg = better healers
[1:42:41] evrgamerr: Well you have to look at the inverse to make sense of healing stats
[1:42:42] AnviThirteen: wild strikes can carry any run tbh
[1:42:43] iamXebra: yeah to parse as a healer your team has to suck
[1:42:47] async00: @dingerdoom only ppl that parse 20 say this
[1:42:48] xtossboyx: the other healer must be weak so you are healing all the dmg taken
[1:42:51] FurylordD: barny
[1:42:52] numbyooo: yeah but warrior died as called so doesnt count
[1:42:52] Shabanks: Shabanks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:42:58] stormlightcookie: BARNEY
[1:42:59] provender_: @Xaryu time to create your new char!
[1:43:02] lizardboiy: barney barney barney
[1:43:04] iamXebra: healing parses = your group isnt doing mechanics and/or has low dps
[1:43:06] Tiliathh: @paladan_tich Not necessarily. Being able to keep the party alive is more important than healer damage. If you can do healer damage, great. If not, it means you are focused on cleaning up everyone elses mistakes.
[1:43:10] Pursuit01: all vid content gone
[1:43:12] Mcsteviec: I stubbed my toe super hard now its bleeded under the nail and hurts :(

[1:43:16] Cant0n: New character Pog
[1:43:22] rizzler90: @Xaryu if you looked at the deaths no one healed the melee while guzu was dispelling. thats why they died. Guzu was told to only prioritize dispelling so healing was on the druids
[1:43:23] lukecartwright95: 5 man bfd clear

[1:43:53] SillyPanda: you cant start with the scarab lord series. You won't get a lot of the references D:

[3:32:19] themadfeltcher: def get lavaburst rune before RFC cause you can only go once
[3:32:24] ronke420: lava lash is needed becouse early cost 1 mana
[3:32:34] Apocrisy: is Xarmoomoo dead?
[3:32:35] Dahra: !SODCORE
[3:32:35] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[3:32:40] laimonas1121: i fink he understood that you are on hard now :D
[3:32:47] FZanix: I told my friend about your stream and when he checked it out the first thing bro said was "That's a good looking dude."
[3:32:48] rpkxnoscope57: shamans should have a 3sec pickup for each totem that cant be used in combat and if you get too far you have to get a new totem from trainer
[3:32:54] Kettopossum: @asloff Bruh, if it worked that way 80% of players wouldn't have more than 5 runes LUL
[3:33:03] xNotorietyx: @Xaryu its so funny watching everyone come in and assume you died
[3:33:03] SpaceCowboy0811: Was hoping for Pally or rogue at last
[3:33:10] Thejacob250: 5 mana later
[3:33:17] spear1321: why would he wanna do another non glory run by getting the op rune early
[3:33:21] catapultingyomama: hardcore icc in the future pog
[3:33:27] marcelomakulas: @Xaryu  you should play Human Paladin
[3:33:38] sniperxer: once upoon a time it was year of the crickets and africa didnt even recieve one
[3:33:42] loldesole: SoDcore Devilsaur challenge? Kappa
[3:33:42] gunzpewpew: You cant use lava burst before level 25
[3:33:43] miercoles_: @catapultingyomama i've thought about this.. i wonder if youd be allowed to kill the LK
[3:33:47] TheMeescoman: Yeah if thats the goal you shouldnt
[3:33:48] morat_g: How does shammy feel so far? What spec are you going for?
[3:33:55] Xuranus83: there’s a rune in that kolkar area that you will need to group for the portal.
[3:33:56] catapultingyomama: @miercoles_ ikr
[3:33:59] like48kittens: @Xaryu does it feel like all the added moves are just far superior to all the standard moves in sod?
[3:34:01] Apocrisy: You can't repeatedly do BFD because of the addon right? it would make for great content death=delete kelris.
[3:34:02] themadfeltcher: secret shaman hax, flamtongue does a damage range based on weapon speed (like 12-18), but when you dual wield the offhand, for some reason, uses your main hand weapon speed. So a slow mainhand and a really fast offhand makes it hit fast, for max damage
[3:34:18] Cant0n: Calling it no glory given risk to get it is wild
[3:34:23] cannlbal: yes
[3:34:24] Libertas09: For sure
[3:34:25] winningfob: not all
[3:34:28] bloodstuck2000: yes

[3:34:47] ninjuhh_d4: Mitch Giving away money again over at his place rn
[3:34:52] KayyzahR: !SODCORE
[3:34:53] StreamElements: Xaryu is playing Season of Discovery with the HARDCORE ADDON to enable Solo-Self Found Hardcore mode, with one twist: NO QUEST LOOT ALLOWED. SERVER = LAVA LASH
[3:34:58] kaizen421: @ninjuhh_d4 when is he not?
[3:34:59] Vindalf: wild growth on druids is really good but costs 268 mana on the other hand starsurge cost 4 mana
[3:35:00] flxrbr: shaman Pog
[3:35:03] Apocrisy: the rune skills scale from base mana, automatically level up and outdo any ranked skill so yeah
[3:35:03] Bolt_: They can complement well though
[3:35:05] Libertas09: The increased mob health pools mean your old ablities are weaker than normal. Not to mention the mana cost cheapness of runes
[3:35:12] shortshorts010: I wanna play so bad but I must work 😩
[3:35:14] Speyto: I mainly use the rune abilities when I cast spells on 5 different alts I lvld, so yea for sure

[3:35:38] r4men_noodle: Long term ofc
[3:35:40] Apocrisy: tech bubble is basically bursting at the moment because of the covid inflation of tech.
[3:35:42] spekkert: Prob Tesla xD
[3:35:43] BootsTheAlpaca: "Time in the market is better than timing the market"

[4:13:29] Mantrakore: @Xaryu As someone who understands the benefits of an espresso machine producing the best cup of coffee, i'm surprised you don't understand the concept of a tv being the premium viewing experience for the content you love to watch when not gaming.
[4:13:33] ryan___mcg: go sports ! or any similar comment is the most cringe thing ever
[4:13:34] mega_wasteoid: natty

[4:54:50] tzuring: @Xaryu  You are comparing iphone against all other brands. Keep in mind that google, most of china phones are on andorid. so 49 % is massive. Also most of the population is in china, india etc.
[4:54:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @gunzpewpew I literally do that on my iPhone dude 😂
[4:54:55] lilssmurk: When are u playing retaill

[4:55:03] Zifadel: @Xaryu Gonna check out Elden Ring DLC when it comes out?
[4:55:04] saint_deniz: They are close call (coming from a European). Apple is good at marketing. let's be honest. I choose Apple only of one reason. For me it is a matter of anti-trust to Google.
[4:55:05] tsetse2fly: @stekkermane Not true at all. Sure some androids have it like that. But there are many other android phones that are less bloat than Iphone
[4:55:05] adam_brisbane: yes it is easier
[4:55:11] koolterminator: Sowe
[4:55:12] Trav_Where: statistically there's a better chance it was an android user

[4:55:26] morat_g: It's the same app, regardless of phone operating system
[4:55:27] barkerdoa: don’t forget android covers a shit ton of phone models and iPhone doesn’t xaryu  this also includes very cheap and crappy phones that run android not all top models
[4:55:27] RickPhilip: In some countries, you have to pay for each SMS message, with WhatsApp you only need an internet connection..pretty simple explanation tbh
[4:55:27] nutsnackk: I am using a blackberry. KEKW
[4:55:28] Skriptmonkey: EZ, on android it's a toggle for prime sub.
[4:55:30] Dryzc: The iphone userbase will continue to grow because of the way apple sets up its ecosystem.  Once youre on apple products, specifically the iphone, it becomes difficult to move back to android.  Everything is tied together on the apple platform, from your pictures to your documents.  Android is the opposite, it is easy to switch from android to ios.  Due to this, over time, the userbase will continue to trend towards apple.
[4:55:30] xofilip: Just subbed with an android to Pika
[4:55:31] lilssmurk: When are u playing retail
[4:55:35] key_5: will you stream elden ring?
[4:55:42] Seoken1: @graziNNN maybe its just personal experience, I was going through 4-5 androids a year, switched to apple 10 years ago, 2 phones
[4:55:45] d0zeboy: I’ve had both iPhone and an Android for multiple years and I can say they are the same
[4:55:48] TheKraken2024: Elden Ring DLC is going to consume my life
[4:55:48] key_5: nice
[4:55:56] tackerta: @Dryzc and thats extremely predatory
[4:55:57] Mckenziehehe: @Seoken1 same here

[4:56:05] megacornmuffin: excited for new sod next month
[4:56:07] d0zeboy: there’s no real noticeable difference between iPhone and androids
[4:56:08] Dryzc: @tackerta i agree
[4:56:10] fmxhc: its trash
[4:56:12] niemax: @seoken1 and how about UX? the literally most important part of the product for an average user so for 95% of the world. UX is superior on Android? KEKW
[4:56:12] 0luja: you mean the one android had 2 years ago?
[4:56:13] graziNNN: @graziNNN you can't say Android, it's an OS, not a phone. Buy a samsung
[4:56:14] stekkermane: @tsetse2fly yeah ofc there are some but they are few and far inbetween, or require you to use custom de-googled android ROMs

[4:58:01] The_RightTwix: I think androids can receive facetimes, you just can't send them
[4:58:01] kaizen421: apple is such a cult its actually insane

[4:58:08] OMGmacros: bro you 30 and succumb to peer pressure?
[4:58:12] Asceus_: how is it "android vs iphone" btw? it's more like apple vs samsung huawei xiaomi etc.. so I think iphone is still the winner because it reached 49% against several brands..

[4:58:48] barkerdoa: @xaryu don’t forget android covers a shit ton of phone models and iPhone doesn’t xaryu  this also includes very cheap and crappy phones that run android not all top models
[4:58:48] rephlex08: Nah, anyone hosting a facetime video call can create a link. They send it to you, and you join it like it was a zoom call.

[4:59:04] Puppytime: it's too vulnerable.
[4:59:05] saint_deniz: @Xaryu you are mostly correct. This is the area of expertise of Apple. They lock you in to the ecoszystem, by excluding other areas.
[4:59:05] Breevok: US vs TRotW. THe real world has embraced WhatsAp
[4:59:07] JuggaBugga: was that skull a quest item?

[4:59:41] afk_rudy: let's play guild wars 2
[4:59:41] Babobop: the reason you never hear iphone users talking shit is because they're actually happy with their phones, android users are always complaining because their subsconscious knows their phone sucks
[4:59:42] Udenwo: LOL
[4:59:44] HeisyTV: Guild wars is dope

[5:01:28] keredj: Food Pog
[5:01:29] Skriptmonkey: @niemax I work in IT and have had to support both iPhone and Android users. Android user experience is always easier.
[5:01:30] boobaoogabooga: Mitch just died
[5:01:31] Reaperz_kinetic: @grazinnn it’s always the android users that talk shit cause y’all know Samsung is inferior

[5:02:43] dobbygang19: Oh snaps. Eye spy with my little eye
[5:02:45] graziNNN: @niemax Android OS is hard to learn? Hmm
[5:02:46] JuggaBugga: was that skull a quest item?

[5:02:48] Bahood: i got you bro

[5:03:23] Seoken1: Iphone is more reliable/streamlined and has a better user experience, android has better technology. Both things can be true @Xaryu. Iphone user btw
[5:03:25] Nightmareo: Apple is for people who like structure and Android is for people who like having the freedom to do what they want
[5:03:25] Reaperz_kinetic: @grazinnn that’s not a thing my friend 😂
[5:03:25] afk_rudy: had the pen for business closing deals and the phone camera was dope

[5:03:45] Saiauriel: If I find out someone in my contacts is using android I instantly delete and block them. you don't wanna associate with poor people
[5:03:46] olibabbino: That's not even true
[5:03:48] niemax: @grazinnn Got real quiet huh? Point proven.
[5:03:48] lilplatotv: not even true
[5:03:49] Twix3z: I have an iPhone for 2 years but android is bis since I use to have one for 5 years
[5:03:52] Lazyawpsilver123: Imagine the level of proficiency you could achieve on Tinder if you invested the same amount of time as you do on WOW
[5:03:52] thenavydaddy: yes thats better
[5:03:55] freddan92: Android has WAYYYYYY better tech
[5:03:59] graziNNN: @niemax huh?

[5:03:59] samoth_f: Android open source
[5:04:00] curveybreaker: KEKW
[5:04:02] HEXEDstream: Having what your friends and family use is best either way so it is easier to communicate and use the tools.
[5:04:03] olibabbino: That's like 2005 arguments that they haven't updated
[5:04:07] Tropicocity: iPhone you can basically only customize the case
[5:04:10] tandre92: ????????? you being sarcastic
[5:04:14] imjdmate: whats the new joruney?
[5:04:16] Tiliathh: A phone is a phone is a phone. All yall are fighting about is branding. This is so stupid.

[5:04:24] SghettiBoy: ground beef and rice?
[5:04:24] Faymatic: But Apple is way More Safe
[5:04:25] Xuranus83: iPhone does folders and widgets now. that’s why I switched a couple years ago.
[5:04:27] dobbygang19: All phones do the same thing it's just about what you're comfortable with
[5:04:28] RickPhilip: @xjfryx lol...iphone mini users fit in as well in that case
[5:04:28] mstr_shake: apple OS is like the operating system equivalent of bumpers at a bowling ally, its safe, simple easy, great for boomers. Android for ppl with brains and independence
[5:04:29] Reaperz_kinetic: @nightmareo explain to me how it’s true
[5:04:30] Tropicocity: Do they still force you to use itunes chat, i havent had an iphone since the 4S
[5:04:30] king8515: apple>android
[5:04:30] thenavydaddy: dynamic island is on every android if you want
[5:04:31] sodafountain17: do iphones come with chargers now
[5:04:31] BlameCanadaTV: There is the developer experience too, which is also different
[5:04:34] enigmasvea: cereal?
[5:04:34] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu The biggest tech youtuber just did a blind camera test poll and Pixel(android) won bigtime
[5:04:38] LoveSiiah: ive had my iphone 7+ for like 8 years lol
[5:04:41] xxcagerxx: Android is just an OS, it has nothing to do with tech. That would be the HW manufacturers like Samsung.
[5:04:41] nikola420tesla: I just dont like Apple's company and policies in general.  They are very anti-consumer, anti- right to repair, etc..
[5:04:42] underdosage: we’re all just sold on the idea that new is always better
[5:04:44] paparevan: iPhone is always late to the party when it comes to key features
[5:04:49] Lazyawpsilver123: Imagine the level of proficiency you could achieve on Tinder if you invested the same amount of time as you do on WOW
[5:04:50] aspiration89: @xxcagerxx YEP

[5:05:04] HoppsAlot: Dang... Got me wanting to throw my TV out the window
[5:05:04] olibabbino: COPIUM
[5:05:07] toadoil: yeah iphone camera is dogshit
[5:05:10] cclusii: all these losers with there 420p androids
[5:05:10] Reaperz_kinetic: yeah Samsung has always had better cameras that’s extremely true
[5:05:12] largist_: as android user I give you that its nice with apple that everything just work straight out of the box
[5:05:12] Tropicocity: iphones even use samsung panels for their screens now
[5:05:13] espi: rice is technically cereal
[5:05:18] Faymatic: as a Developer i can say Apple keeps a way better Track of what you put into the Store. Google dont gives a F so you cam basicly Upload Viruses
[5:05:19] fueego_: this whole phone OS wars proves how effective simple marketing can be, it's mind boggling @Xaryu
[5:05:20] dobbygang19: Google software on pixel cameras is def Stier
[5:05:21] BlindGiraffe: Imagine if beef was better than chicken. Would be a crazy world
[5:05:23] Nightmareo: @Reaperz_kinetic Apple locks what u have the ability to do but is very streamlined and you are paying for that structure and security. Android allows you to do whatever you want in exchange for less security
[5:05:24] tsetse2fly: Not always
[5:05:26] keredj: just had rice turkey and broc. Inspired from yall thank you
[5:05:27] imjdmate: what's the new journey ?
[5:05:28] tsetse2fly: but a lot
[5:05:29] QTWhite0613: @Xaryu just do a poll for chat who is android user or who is apple
[5:05:30] Xuranus83: that’s fair
[5:05:34] Ddorn34: Except when they were the FIRST smartphone a we know them now
[5:05:36] comp_sci_kid: IPhone just needs a lot more testing, because Android OS system is very fragmented
[5:05:38] BlameCanadaTV: The big difference is that Apple has control over the hardware and software
[5:05:39] basedokayegspammer: COPIUM
[5:05:41] thenavydaddy: just buy the last android youll see
[5:05:43] bburton02: Lol APple is Blizzard
[5:05:45] niemax: correct
[5:05:47] BlameCanadaTV: Android is a lot of 3rd party
[5:05:47] HoppsAlot: @imjdmate Enhance Shaman to tank BFD with viewers
[5:05:52] purrfecto: @Xaryu i have a new challenge for you ... level to 25 with no quests
[5:05:52] Tropicocity: Apple makes the best tablet I'll say that
[5:05:56] CDank: the blizzard strat
[5:05:58] drummond777: yeah they made a computer LUL

[5:06:01] mstr_shake: Apple "they made a computer"
[5:06:01] catapultingyomama: Basically a copycat
[5:06:03] Bahood: they had the first steve jobs
[5:06:03] UnsafeCell: apple has the first phone I think
[5:06:04] drakeeatscakes: iphone was the first phone without buttons. Everyone been playing catch up since then
[5:06:05] Nemisane: 100%
[5:06:06] Gabriel_mer: honestly does anyone ever get excited when they upgrade thier Iphone anymore? back in the day it was exciting because things were new, now not so much
[5:06:08] Faymatic: in generell Apple is way More Secure. if you like having your Data at least kinda Safe Apple is ahead
[5:06:08] largist_: apple takes androids features in late,  ut when they release it is close to perfection in relibiality and usability
[5:06:12] Seone12: Is a 1060gtx still good for wow retail ?
[5:06:12] BlameCanadaTV: From experience, Apple does hardware way better than software
[5:06:15] MarkHewson66: Apple pc before a pc
[5:06:16] cabeshpash: iphone was innovative
[5:06:17] graziNNN: @drakeeatscakes yet, they are still behind
[5:06:18] dorkasteri: bro look out for payo
[5:06:19] FrenzyFusion: huh??? are people forgetting the original iphone?

[5:06:26] imjdmate: what's the new journey?
[5:06:28] Faymatic: also the Communication between Apple products is super convinient
[5:06:28] olibabbino: We won Pog
[5:06:28] blazzedzz: Evil never creates only replicats
[5:06:29] SoapGuy: Apple did basiclly start the home PC market though
[5:06:29] Reaperz_kinetic: @nightmareo except that’s not really true because you aren’t locked in what you have the ability to do. I have an iPhone and there isn’t anything I can’t do
[5:06:29] Twix3z: naah bad analogy LUL
[5:06:30] thenavydaddy: but android are better
[5:06:30] NekoTheSpook010: Blizz ui vs addons
[5:06:31] paparevan: I was an iPhone user from like 2011-2020 and then I switched to Android and haven't looked back
[5:06:31] lotharvr: @xaryu you remember the Kultiras guy?)))
[5:06:32] aspiration89: @Faymatic None of these android fanboys will agree with that LUL
[5:06:37] morat_g: Next convo... hmmm... Yemen?
[5:06:38] Mugginslol: @Xaryu dude how long is your hair??
[5:06:40] OMGmacros: apple streamlines to the point of chokeholding you into a specific experience
[5:06:40] xxcagerxx: @cabeshpash iPhone technically copied IBM
[5:06:41] StormRellik: WOOOOOT  we are one agine...lol
[5:06:42] ant0ff: your ep1 yt video is gonna be just u ranting about phones in each clip
[5:06:43] Tropicocity: @Seone12 Classic yes, retail it will need to be put on low-medium at 1080p if you plan to go beyond 60FPS at all, lots of visual upgrades
[5:06:43] JuggaBugga: was that skull a quest item?
[5:06:45] saberign: @Xaryu do u watch football
[5:06:49] TheRainMan17: @Xaryu Watch out, payo might trick you
[5:06:49] Lohai: i dont agree
[5:06:55] mstr_shake: Apple = base blizz UI, Android = addons
[5:06:56] Nightmareo: @Reaperz_kinetic OMEGALUL I can tell you have only ever had an iphone
[5:07:01] Wreckitralph_11: uh have fun with your Android virus
[5:07:05] cabeshpash: @xxcagerxx lol imb phone wasn't at all the same
[5:07:05] CuckBoi5467: Did your Tauren main died?
[5:07:12] amherian001: Xar what would happen if u ran into Payo kultirus now?
[5:07:15] largist_: apple takes androids features in late,  ut when they release it is close to perfection in relibiality and usability
[5:07:23] Reaperz_kinetic: @nightmareo nope… I started with Samsung and I still have one for the camera so you’re wrong again 0/2 nice try tho bud

[5:08:46] panoramix87: Use Earthshock for damage lol
[5:09:01] tsetse2fly: Shaman has to be the most boring class to level solo
[5:09:02] Nightmareo: @Reaperz_kinetic sorry but thats just wrong
[5:09:06] Reaperz_kinetic: @grazinnn I have a nice ass camera too. but sometimes I don’t feel like carrying a 3 foot 20 pound 13k lense

[5:09:52] Reaperz_kinetic: @nightmareo literally saw someone earlier say that iPhone users can’t download emulators for Pokémon when I literally have one on my iPhone that I use for Pokémon almost daily 😂
[5:09:58] panoramix87: not just interrupt its big damage
[5:10:09] panoramix87: instant cast low cooldown big damage interrupt all in one

The effect  it has compared to THC/ethanol is also very minor. But I don't think twitch chat is the appropriate place for these kind of discussions XD

[6:35:57] r4men_noodle: Nopers
[6:35:58] pogxgaming: @Xaryu Go to mulgore
[6:35:58] adam_brisbane: do the call of fire quest get your fire totems
[6:36:07] samymnster: 3 yeras and thats all u got?
[6:36:16] eldritchmustard: dont die though
[6:36:19] themadfeltcher: yeah searing totem helps soloing nicely

[6:36:24] jarketv: what server is on the hrode on
[6:36:26] themadfeltcher: don't fall going to the summit, dodgy oath
[6:36:27] daylightends89: dont die in the cave

[6:37:04] SetDog1: rare xaryu shaman footage,  i feel like you might find less exciting than mage
[6:37:05] lukemeleney: cast berserking then cast healing wave
[6:37:06] y6mz: i havent seen staff in over 20 runs
[6:37:11] chr47: Tell that to leather wearers Sadge
[6:37:12] jack_0f_clubs: @himos96 which one
[6:37:12] himos96: because i just sold epic xbow at 200 gold, i think it was good deal
[6:37:14] SurrealAndre: people would absolutely pay 100+ for the sword or staff
[6:37:32] themadfeltcher: dual wield will speed up, but weapons matter a lot
[6:37:32] macjcool: once you get lava burst you win
[6:37:36] weahhc: u dont die as shaman
[6:37:37] themadfeltcher: which makes it hard as ssf
[6:37:37] Trav_Where: i've been running bfd since the second lockout, every lockout, up to 3 toons per lockout now and have still never seen the staff drop
[6:37:43] Pixiepantss: @Trav_Where same

[6:37:47] alejandro7com: Looks like the cactus is providing some extra spiky inspiration!
[6:37:48] adam_brisbane: I have 4 25s and shaman always felt the weakest of them
[6:37:48] y6mz: @Trav_Where same
[6:38:01] SurrealAndre: streamer client
[6:38:02] Mad_Mab: sword went for 210 ish yesterday
[6:38:03] amherian001: same
[6:38:07] blazzedzz: You need molten blast rune
[6:38:11] yellowgaiden: i got the staff yesterday after 15 runes
[6:38:16] steamedmussel25: ive seen the staff and sword drop several times now but not the cross bow ones
[6:38:18] ZFredddy: lightning shield is your most efficient damage ability
[6:38:20] TarvisGaming: my shaman at 25 is great for solo
[6:38:20] adam_brisbane: Druid, Priest Hunter and Shaman
[6:38:21] tengenx: way of earth changes everything
[6:38:23] frumpy96: warrior stronk
[6:38:24] al_capow: shaman has felt waaaaay stronger than war for me
[6:38:28] al_capow: and way more versatile
[6:38:29] yellowgaiden: lightning shield is useless
[6:38:32] jakeiszerocool: than warrior? uuhhh
[6:38:33] CrispyNugs: always keep the DS up
[6:38:40] Mad_Mab: war is good in sod
[6:38:41] macjcool: I got two druids a rogue and a ret. both druids resto lol
[6:38:42] themadfeltcher: pre cast it, full mana, cast again
[6:38:43] Jmaguirez: you need way of earth and lava lash, and a good OH at like lvl 12/13 and it gets so much easier
[6:38:44] ImBlaney: shaman gets good when u get molten blast and shiel mastery
[6:38:44] yellowgaiden: never use lihgtning shield tbh
[6:38:52] NelsonGamingShow: BALLS OF LIGHTING
[6:38:57] Greasy_Doug: everyone spitting facts but it changes when you get new ranks of spells
[6:38:58] tedthebod: earth shield is passive damage too
[6:39:00] eldritchmustard: always use lightning shield
[6:39:07] yellowgaiden: why?
[6:39:11] lukemeleney: totems man
[6:39:12] Deomas11: Shaman feels slow till DW
[6:39:12] yellowgaiden: its pointless mana
[6:39:15] themadfeltcher: shaman is bits and pieces damage, light shield, auto attack, searing totem, flame shock
[6:39:21] 0luja: do you need to go to TB to get dual wield?
[6:39:24] yellowgaiden: yes
[6:39:25] SurrealAndre: @Deomas11 this, life changes after
[6:39:31] adam_brisbane: I think shaman will do really good at 40 as ELe shaman will be way more valuable
[6:39:33] yellowgaiden: gloves yies
[6:39:33] Deomas11: DW + Lava Lash quest together
[6:39:34] CrispyNugs: its a reward for lava lash
[6:39:34] Jmaguirez: lava lash has DW
[6:39:37] 0luja: Dual wield is not a rune
[6:39:39] Spiritjoo: The only thing shaman is actually good for in Phase 1 is tanking
[6:39:40] crvyxn: you can dual wield without rune
[6:39:40] themadfeltcher: it's a reward from rune qust, lavalash is rune
[6:39:41] adam_brisbane: no DW is ont a rune
[6:39:41] SurrealAndre: you get DW naturally, lava lash is the rune
[6:39:42] yellowgaiden: yes it is
[6:39:42] FRONKLINtheTORTLE: it's a skill you get when you do the lava lash rune quest
[6:39:43] rudisaurus: its quiest
[6:39:44] TarvisGaming: DW is but you dont need it. once you get lava lash you learn dual wield
[6:39:46] ImBlaney: yeah might be impossible to get in ssf
[6:39:46] yellowgaiden: DW is a rune lol
[6:39:46] Spiritjoo: It is greatly outshined everywhere else
[6:39:58] FRONKLINtheTORTLE: lava lash is like a level 10 quest that starts in TB
[6:39:59] CrispyNugs: DW is NOT a rune @yellowgaiden
[6:39:59] yellowgaiden: lava lash and Dw are together
[6:40:00] adam_brisbane: you can DW with out the Duel Wield rune
[6:40:01] ImBlaney: in solo self found its the 16 turbocharger to get the 10% hit
[6:40:03] necromahr: u can do the rune now for dual wield its easy
[6:40:04] yellowgaiden: no u cant
[6:40:09] CrispyNugs: yes
[6:40:15] CrispyNugs: the dual wield rune is just for spec 5% extra hit
[6:40:16] TarvisGaming: yes you can
[6:40:16] SmugJerry: @Xaryu what do you think is the coolest looking race in WoW?
[6:40:18] Qurco: You can
[6:40:18] slammateo: is a quest at LV 10
[6:40:19] SetDog1: youll enjoy shaman when you get scarlet gear and the ravager axe

[6:40:29] themadfeltcher: there IS a dual wield rune, that gives 10% hit. But that's not dual wield SKILL
[6:40:32] moocowthecow: Yes you can, it's a quest. The rune is enhanced dual weird, it adds hit and spell hit
[6:40:37] gdkpgold: dual wield dual wield dual wield
[6:40:42] yellowgaiden: lava lash is improved with flame tongue weapon

[6:43:15] jonasmedk1: @Xaryu, the DUAL WIELD SKILL is taught by a Tauren in TB after a small quest chain. Just to the right from the elevators. But the actual RUNE that IMPROVES the dual wielding skill is a chestrune.
[6:43:18] dycegamer: @xaryu The DW rune just makes your DW better.

[6:56:08] RockyMountainOyster: do you dw as tank shaman?
[6:56:20] Prissy18: Love the HC streams! HC Hype!

[6:56:58] Nimbus723: I've heard dual rockbiter is nuts for tanking
[6:56:59] scivationx: It's way easier to get the shaman runes in Mulgore, highly recommend heading that way

[6:57:08] waakeland: Just tuned in. Any new rules to this SoDcore attempt?
[6:57:08] SubiiWReX: literally just did this quest and got the quest item in one kill
[6:57:23] aujewinashoe: youre gonna have insane threat from rockbiter either way
[6:57:29] FeelsBadWoman: @xaryu you can tank aquanis and kelris dw, they deal non physical dmg
[6:57:31] yellowgaiden: threat is no issue as a shaman
[6:57:33] aujewinashoe: way of earth + rockbiter = unbeatable threat
[6:57:37] Deomas11: Because of WoE rune, Rockbiter is insane threat
[6:57:40] bagrain: dual rock biter is bis in general
[6:57:41] Dakix: the shield feels good on shammy imo
[6:57:44] The_Crane: Way of earth is soo good
[6:57:46] yellowgaiden: shield feels real nice
[6:57:58] bbocmot2021: way of the earth
[6:57:58] TodBobertson: Dead = Not hurting you.
[6:57:59] smol_monkey_man: kill mobs faster yep
[6:57:59] Spiritjoo: shamans have the most threat in the game
[6:58:02] bbocmot2021: give you dr
[6:58:05] zaebot3000: Shield is too much mana
[6:58:05] 808polska: the quicker u kill, the less dmg u take :p
[6:58:08] bagrain: way of earth reduces dmg
[6:58:12] bagrain: taken
[6:58:16] adam_brisbane: way of earth give you more health and less damage
[6:58:16] TodBobertson: Dead = Not hurting you. DW better. Make it dead so it stops making you dead.
[6:58:17] enoch87bear: You run 2x Rockbiter with Way of Earth rune on the pants.
[6:58:24] The_Crane: Way of earth is best tanking rune
[6:58:24] dragonfistyo: only get way of earth from main hand having rock biter
[6:58:25] yellowgaiden: you take 10% less damage with way of earth
[6:58:32] garbage003: GUZU tanked bfd today with two weaps on his shammy
[6:58:34] minimusmax_: @xaryu Washing down my steak with some PRIME AG1 r, such a great tasting way to get my essential nutrients
[6:58:40] aujewinashoe: dw tanking is good with gear/group
[6:58:44] Greasy_Doug: you deffo want to shield for raid its sketch to dw before you have good gear
[6:58:48] cobraCordite: You get way of earth with just single weapon though
[6:58:48] guldanyall: you get 30% more hp
[6:58:49] YzieGG: u have way more aggro too
[6:58:51] aujewinashoe: if you can get pumped heals its fine to dw
[6:58:53] themadfeltcher: slow MH rockbiter, fast OH flametongue <3
[6:58:54] smol_monkey_man: nah u wanna shield lmao
[6:58:55] Dakix: i dont think with sodcore duel is best
[6:58:57] aujewinashoe: otherwise dmg mit is shield
[6:58:57] cobraCordite: way of earth doesn't stack
[6:59:00] strongmem3s: get way of the earth now for lvling
[6:59:02] DJspookyghost: try it out in dungeons and swap back shield if you feel like you're taking too much damage Okayge
[6:59:03] bbocmot2021: i think you should too
[6:59:09] yellowgaiden: you need armor lol
[6:59:11] themadfeltcher: not for tanking, for leveling
[6:59:12] Craitan: ofc you tank with shield on this char
[6:59:13] blazzedzz: Way of earth is a MUST for HC lol
[6:59:17] kazuHots: shield is 700 armor
[6:59:17] The_Crane: Lots of bosses in BFD do magic dmg, so a shield doesn't even help
[6:59:20] zaebot3000: @Xaryu With little to no gear, you will want a shield 100%. I main shaman
[6:59:21] dragonfistyo: need lvl 12 for purge to get Way of Earth
[6:59:24] Jlo1868: dual tank its the best raid spec
[6:59:25] Armaerei: Tater had a shield and still had some close calls.
[6:59:26] PMA_1: dmg reduc
[6:59:27] someteej: use ur lightning shield all the time boyee
[6:59:34] audasong: OIEEEE, XARYU VOCÊ É UM GATINHOOO, BEIJOS DA SUA ADMIRADORA DO BRASIL :****
[6:59:37] Grashh: @Xaryu Dual wielding without the harder to get rune from engineering materials probably will make it not worth it. the rune gives you 10% hit chance - its massive
[6:59:41] nikotrengen: Never no Bagnon etc.?
[6:59:48] adam_brisbane: Way of earth is how you make earth shock your taunt
[6:59:49] minimusmax_: Make sure to use Xaryus code
[7:00:04] uroelement: Shield rune is chest, way of earth (+30%hp) is legs, you good @Xaryu
[7:00:07] zaebot3000: @Xaryu The shield rune is OP as it gives you TOOONNSSS of armor.
[7:00:09] c7drew: I'm baking high protein bread rn
[7:00:09] Aisssey: lightning shield is super mana efficient, cdew always spams it leveling.
[7:00:11] Direwolf_1995: hey xar :) hope you and your fam is doing great
[7:00:14] Greasy_Doug: dual wield is 100% less tanky but gives a lot more threat and dmg#
[7:00:30] Aitor229: Lightning shield good makes u go much faster
[7:00:35] taubehut: taubehut subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 86 months! xarW yeea
[7:00:38] kazuHots: shaman is herb + alch -> skinning leather -> mining engi ^^
[7:00:45] themadfeltcher: threat won't matter, rest of sodcore will have avg gear and low dmg
[7:00:56] Pillz_: @Xaryu will u onlyfangs naxx?
[7:01:00] Slaughter13x: I thought you were gonna run warlock @Xaryu
[7:01:04] FeelsBadWoman: shield is 100% better, da maybe on aquanis and kelris since they deal non physical
[7:01:05] codyc318: whats the goal now that BFD has been cleared
[7:01:15] nekrofyll: Xar, you excited for P2?
[7:01:16] ruttoluikero: RB dw tanking is good if you have healers to support it, it's going to be healing intensive with ssf setup you run. Shield + 1 hander is still very strong threat and seeing as everyone else is ssf too, threat shouldnt be issue. The run will be even safer with you having molten blast available for more aoe control..
[7:01:23] dragonfistyo: how is anyone getting dark iron ordinance for rune quest on sodcore?

[7:02:01] someteej: oh SHIT forgot its SoDcore... never getting dual wield rune lol
[7:02:03] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: the phases are too long
[7:02:05] ruttoluikero: level 10, iirc when you go TB @TuckFelstra_
[7:02:05] Maiqthehighking: roll above a 0 for my prime sub
[7:02:09] ImBlaney: however alterac is outt
[7:02:10] Dakix: i think its more than a week or 2 for most players
[7:02:12] Codratz: maybe stop rushing
[7:02:15] yellowgaiden: i think its cool
[7:02:16] nekrofyll: I'm ok with it cus I love leveling alts. SoD has been so alt friendly imo.
[7:02:17] Hugo__93: Well more builds for everyone to try
[7:02:21] Venin6: That's every content phase in wow
[7:02:28] mitchello85: world pvp in phase 2 will be epic and different imo
[7:02:28] Zellane_TV: @xaryu did you get a chance to peep the 1v3 I did? I linked in ur discord
[7:02:28] Pheiro: Do you think that's a direct result of not being able to run dungeons more than once?
[7:02:29] nikotrengen: Will you start P2 non hc?
[7:02:30] Armaerei: AV and AB will be nice
[7:02:34] skAllDays: Alot longer to level with an alt or two, def will be alot to do
[7:02:51] Maiqthehighking: Maiqthehighking subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Close one
[7:02:52] adam_brisbane: For tanking with shield your runes will probably be Shield Mastery, Way of earth and Molten Blast
[7:02:54] alejandro7com: Looks like getting that dual wield rune on SoDcore is like finding a unicorn. Good luck, my friend!
[7:03:09] Nlbbler: Most casuals will take longer than a week to Hit 25-40 and Start raiding i would guess
[7:03:12] 808polska: kill 5 scorpions and u'll loot a green!!
[7:03:21] TodBobertson: Why these crocs blockin yer jock?
[7:03:27] julfri: horde or allianz ?
[7:03:39] stormrager117: What loot we need, I just got here
[7:03:40] marioag714: bro this quest in getting me nuts
[7:03:41] TuckFelstra_: can get dual wielding at lvl 10 with lava lash. not the rune but the skill. makes lvling a bit nicer.
[7:03:45] Deathbann: did moomoo die?
[7:04:09] Syzlak3: drop isnt so low you are just unlucky
[7:04:17] MARCFD: i mustve killed 30-40 crocs on my sodcore char before i got it
[7:04:24] Cant0n: Nice Croc
[7:04:27] Maiqthehighking: This quest is always a tossup, it’s either the first mob or the hundred mob
[7:04:32] ruttoluikero: Having leveld two shamans, I have this belief that the galvanic icon that makes you kill 10 enemies with lighting bolt has hidden buff that boosts your overload procs when mob hp drops below 60%, no statistics just gut feeling SeemsGood
[7:04:33] RadiantBeard: yup
[7:04:36] cnewlou: i got amulet first try
[7:04:41] spunkfilleddowny: didnt for me
[7:04:42] enoch87bear: Type Yo to summon amulet
[7:04:46] Bahood: huge croc
[7:04:57] adam_brisbane: Pog
[7:04:57] macjcool: you gotta call the croc a bitch before you kill it to get it to drop
[7:05:01] afraidanuffin: Healing resets the chances back to 0%
[7:05:02] alejandro7com: Nice job on getting the amulet! The croc must've been intimidated by you calling it a bitch.

[7:12:57] bryn_dee: I have always enjoyed both versions of the game since classic release in 2019, but I 10000000% prefer the community in classic
[7:12:58] Movu: Didn't get me back in retail, but it got me subbing to sod though
[7:13:05] Fewis_: aint no way retail has more maybe more bots
[7:13:12] BigBabaOne77: what is meaning hardcore clear in sod i dont hear from a hardcore mode for sod
[7:13:15] wn7_: And does anyone know a rough number of what the population is on SoD???
[7:13:15] chriss_7273: retail is actually getting better
[7:13:22] nipfrost: nipfrost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! great streams
[7:13:23] twitchara7: i think sod have way more poeple
[7:13:33] Seone12: Retail is coming back Prayge
[7:13:33] spaghettibud69: you got a bag
[7:13:36] sighwarlock: doesnt matter bc retail looks empty anyways
[7:13:39] Sauzes: Why another sodcore char?
[7:13:46] adam_brisbane: SOD just feels like it has more people because you see more in the world then you do in retail
[7:13:58] TroyStory__: I just started playing retail again. Ill always go back I think.
[7:14:01] jesusjammys: Retail has like have the raid logs vs sod and barely anyone logs on sod
[7:14:02] firerrarri: solo shuffle in retail is dead no ?
[7:14:03] withthedraco: im a beginner ret pally, what youtubers and streamers should i be watching to learn? @Xaryu
[7:14:07] jesusjammys: Half*
[7:14:09] Movu: That says a lot about how crap retail is if 50% of subs would rather play something else
[7:14:10] yomamason123: That's what happens when you make 3 different versions of classic
[7:14:26] Seone12: @Movu Still pay the sub to develop retail
[7:14:40] yomamason123: The player base who likes classic get split
[7:14:40] starzha: i wanna get my boyfriend into wow, he has never played, should i have him play classic?
[7:14:42] marioag714: that quest is up
[7:14:53] alejandro7com: Looks like SoD got everyone hooked on retail again! It's like a never-ending cycle of gaming addiction. 😄
[7:14:55] xiClutchBoyix: the retail cope is always crazy.  you hear it literally every single expansion. "this one is good guys".  if retail is your thing then its good, but the game is not objectively getting any better
[7:14:55] YzieGG: I wonder why bgs have 10 min queue in retail but in classic its instant
[7:15:01] sixetqt: sixetqt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[7:15:04] Daphud: All the classes were homogenized at that point too. Healing, CC, AoE made PvP "balanced" because there were so few differences with the classes.
[7:15:12] jarjarbanks17: I'm 19 and I've been. playing since I was 3 years old
[7:15:15] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu

[7:15:35] pogchamper_69: can you imagine if there was no layers
[7:15:36] Deatherage15: @YzieGG depends what faction you are on
[7:15:46] lordgonin: and theyre faction split
[7:15:48] xDeathzDezignx: more people more irritation for me
[7:15:51] jesusjammys: SOD alone has double the raid logs as retail and hardly anyone even logs on SoD that I know of
[7:15:51] crultivar: What do u think about the new gym Iron Forge?:D
[7:15:54] marioag714: is up
[7:16:01] Seone12: they should merge more server and upgrade the server to accomodate more ppl at the same place
[7:16:02] TabouretGang3000: Is there anything you do to not suffer from back pain sitting so much ? im in Computer science and my back is killing me :(

[7:30:00] Nightmareo: classic+
[7:30:01] MrThreePik: Season of Burn
[7:30:02] alejandro7com: Lol guys, what u talking about? Only Legion ftw. I'm here for the nostalgia and epic battles, not a one-race/class commitment for life! 😄
[7:30:07] L2pNic: why wouldnt they

[7:30:30] bread1oaf1: I'd like to replay wrath, but large part of the content is the raids but modern raiding puts me off
[7:30:34] Movu: Relauch WoW as Classic+ with all the new client/server tech, textures etc
[7:30:36] x_bloodyrain_x: I think we'll get tbc era nect
[7:30:37] ruttoluikero: Classic+, new zones, skills/abilities, maybe revamp talent tree a bit, but try keeping the game pace same as it is in classic.
[7:30:39] graziNNN: for way more money
[7:30:47] RockyMountainOyster: YEP with tokens in retail you can always buy gold in classic
[7:30:50] graziNNN: Plus blizzard keeps the $
[7:30:53] blazzedzz: Banning gold buying would be the best x pack LUL
[7:30:54] arieuh: wish people go back to retail man.... they only speaking about logs, gs game is trash now
