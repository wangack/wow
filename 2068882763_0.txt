[10:39:06] JDXL: i also need divine stoorm for sheathe of light
[10:39:18] Vice_Syndicate: I hear what you're saying about not using poisons but from this wording it sounds like it's a straight up loss to not use instant poison   "When you inflict any other poison on a target, you also inflict Deadly Poison. If your weapon does not have a poison applied, it has a chance to trigger instant poison as if instant poison were applied."
[10:39:33] JDXL: nvm i dont care about that im killing redrigdge
[10:39:40] JDXL: i aint doing all that
[10:39:51] JDXL: maybe when im 40

[10:42:37] Vice_Syndicate: It doesn't say I lose the deadly brew rune effect if I apply instant poison. It says if I apply it I also trigger Deadly Poison on Instant Poison trigger. Where does Losing Deadly Brew Rune come from?
[10:42:57] wallhuh: buy out all of them and sell them for more :tf:

[10:43:40] Vice_Syndicate: ok
[10:43:48] Vice_Syndicate: I understand you now
[10:43:58] Vice_Syndicate: Thank you for explaining. It's so strangely worded though
[10:46:05] kallysen: its like they have a competition on who can write the worst tooltip and have it pass
