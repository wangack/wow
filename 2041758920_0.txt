[0:50:14] pattarx: rdruids feel like a hard thing to balance because its hard to put a value on healing that you can do while cc'd (i.e. hots)

[1:06:16] averyyi: time to go play palworld
[1:06:18] evil_primate: I'm having so much fun on disc priest, Presvoker is no fun man
[1:06:19] shredder1111: need to see some rogues in the lobby
[1:06:22] chrisiirc: @admiraltegetthoff what you think hes doing
[1:06:22] fantasiesgx: @admiraltegetthoff self suck
[1:06:27] jporter_: i actually really like this patch so far
[1:06:30] everjaz: sure
[1:06:38] shydhtv: ya just did an arena and it was a damage fest lasted like 45 seconds
[1:06:39] chrisiirc: yeah... me too
[1:06:40] ShaHugs: gluck gluck 9000
[1:06:42] fantasiesgx: my hpal seems to fall over very hard now
[1:06:44] shredder1111: that doesnt look weird at all
[1:06:46] Lathrien: self suck?
[1:06:53] bestchaakbestjjang: why are you cutting your nails outside of the bathroom bro
[1:07:05] JBugaboo: outlaw
[1:07:06] shydhtv: u think feral is good now?
[1:07:06] Lathrien: rogues
[1:07:08] tarvester: we all do a self suck sometimes man not a big deal
[1:07:11] ShaHugs: I switched to physical build as enh and started running at hpals, its super fun
[1:07:12] ryanblue98: more stam just means more time to not press cds
[1:07:12] Saidragon: What is the amp means? Right in the corner
[1:07:25] testosteronald: j
[1:07:25] chrisiirc: feral sucks big cock fr
[1:07:31] Saidragon: *apm
[1:07:33] cloudberrylive: you have a quest to turn in there chuck
[1:07:36] sober_toaster: do you think mw’er is good?
[1:07:38] W00dyyx: Where did you get your APM weakaura?
[1:07:43] ShaHugs: actions per minute
[1:07:58] zachgamegodx: attacks per minute rofl
[1:08:05] ShaHugs: pikaboo was playing with it on his ele and was at 600+ lol
[1:08:18] csjustin: are you still playing SOD or wotlk
[1:08:24] Saidragon: Thanks for the answere
[1:08:35] testosteronald: cdew when i was little i started watching you because i tought your logo is cool lol
[1:08:41] zachgamegodx: @shahugs think it counts overloads as actions tbh
[1:08:41] Solastro: you see the tweet about dekel doing like 900 apm in wrath and  probably using bannable programs
[1:08:43] kaoreal: !factor
[1:08:43] Moobot: @kaoreal Get 50% off your first box using this link! https://strms.net/factor75_cdewx
[1:08:45] Solastro: and then he retweeted it
[1:08:58] bornbetter: !factor
[1:08:59] ShaHugs: @zachgamegodx pretty sure it's just key presses
[1:09:03] damiaN_bda: do you have any idea why i cannot get your shroud WA to work lol, am i missing something in setting it up?
[1:09:08] kaoreal: Oh snap it looks like there is Factor Canada now
[1:09:09] shredder1111: 900 is cheating
[1:09:10] kaoreal: Here's hoping
[1:09:20] jo4sho85: is this the only healer ya focused on this season?
[1:09:28] Solastro: @cdewx  then dekel retweeted the tweet accusing him lmao
[1:09:28] zachgamegodx: @shahugs no way he’s pressing 10 keys a second haha
[1:09:31] admiraltegetthoff: 900 apm is literally pointless ha ha
[1:09:33] bestchaakbestjjang: i guarantee you you cannot get to 900 no matter how hard you try
[1:09:40] tarth_100: @cdewx you think that hpriest lightbringer build is worth with the changes?
[1:09:43] bestchaakbestjjang: hes botting 100%
[1:09:45] ShaHugs: @zachgamegodx ele goes prrrrrrrrrrrrr
[1:10:07] SebboTheFro: 900 APM is guaranteed chats, just compare to world class LoL/SC/Age of Empire players and you'll figure it out lol
[1:10:14] SebboTheFro: cheats*
[1:10:19] tarth_100: lightweaver* but all good.
[1:10:24] samiyam: bro dekel literally had my stream pulled up before i fought him 1st game and swapped spec BEFORE i even fought him and counter geared
[1:10:32] samiyam: guys a literal pos hooman
[1:10:39] magixss: 900 apm is just useless for wow anyway singe you are on global. Not effective actions no matter how much you spam click. Plus you didn't do that high apm in SC2 so def cheats.
[1:10:58] bestchaakbestjjang: seems like you just need to play better @samiyam  Kappa
[1:11:01] volbyz: i like when dekel says sc2 pros have 800 apm so its normal, but its like the avg sc2 pro is no where near that on avg lol...
[1:11:03] bestchaakbestjjang: how do you loseeere
[1:11:12] samiyam: hes literally streaming himself
[1:11:12] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:11:22] samiyam: ppl literally get banned in other games for that stuff
[1:11:43] bestchaakbestjjang: they only get banned if they are griefing
[1:11:56] bestchaakbestjjang: hes sniping to farm points off of you thats not bannable just scummy
[1:11:56] kaoreal: FUK they do Canada now, but not my postal code yet
[1:11:57] samiyam: and all im saying is if u do that kind of stuff willingly on ur own stream u probably have the means to bot
[1:11:59] SebboTheFro: @samiyam I mean if you could prove it you could probably get him off twitch for a while, twitch takes action against streamsniping
[1:12:06] 3william3: is there another season before the expansion or are we in the war within waiting room
[1:12:07] samiyam: and its obvious he uses ahk
[1:12:24] samiyam: and he was also accused of cheating in legion
[1:12:29] samiyam: the fish is very stinky
[1:12:35] ShaHugs: if I was in the lobby on my enh I'd let that bolt land every time
[1:12:39] bestchaakbestjjang: he doesnt even have to know if you are streaming @samiyam , wotlk has weakaura that tracks when you are queueing
[1:12:45] admiraltegetthoff: 900 apm is 15 actions per second, how would you ever do that haha, idk poor keyboard man
[1:12:49] knadam13: would rather lose the shuffle battle on the field than the precog battle in my heart
[1:13:00] samiyam: ur prob right @bestchaakbestjjang i was legit impressed he knew it was me my very 1st game i qd up
[1:13:20] bestchaakbestjjang: no it is 100% true. thats how moonfirebeam got his r1s
[1:13:25] SebboTheFro: @admiraltegetthoff I mean there is zero chance he is doing that, the literal gods of APm games like SC2 and Age of Empires doesnt have 900 APM
[1:13:33] bestchaakbestjjang: he queued against 1200 trashcans when no one was queueing
[1:13:40] bestchaakbestjjang: and got +2 for like 300 games
[1:14:23] bestchaakbestjjang: the WA notifies you if someone has left arena etc. joined arena
[1:15:19] NPBeharry: early stream poggers
[1:15:22] volbyz: @SebboTheFro i mean u can in sc2 quite easily via rapid fire keys but 900 effective apm is a hard no.
[1:15:37] ArthurKeraqs: What class is that ?
[1:15:39] SebboTheFro: @volbyz Yeah but Im talking effective APM
[1:15:43] shredder1111: short time dial lining up with essence break so good
[1:15:56] ArthurKeraqs: Did they add smth after monk?
[1:16:05] SebboTheFro: @volbyz and in those games you dont have to move your character etc with different hotkeys WHILE pressing others
[1:16:35] volbyz: @SebboTheFro i wasn't defending him, i was just saying 900 apm isn't "impossible", thats why i specified effective APM.
[1:16:35] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:16:43] SebboTheFro: @volbyz Yeah

[5:26:26] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:26:32] nonhornypeesh: i like time stop
[5:26:34] zachgamegodx: it’s good if your team goes mage but if they go lock it’s just free cc immunity for him I guess
[5:27:17] nonhornypeesh: i thought as a defensive, demo pets are fading during those 5s
[5:27:39] nonhornypeesh: and can insta cancel a ray
[5:27:42] Onshuffle: druid is playing 60 yards away you have to run through their dps to swoop
[5:27:44] nonhornypeesh: so i thought it was ok
[5:27:45] ChumpSeason: chrono loop is fun but gets pushed out by the others
[5:28:09] zachgamegodx: if your team goes mage, 100% take shroud but going lock where mage is free it seems counter intuitive

[6:11:11] gh0sty: bc season1 was funas hell
[6:11:15] forshard: i think the arena experience is you get farmed enough to get frustrated, go online, download a fistful of weakauras and addons that scream at you until you die a little less
[6:11:16] RealXrave: OMEGALUL

[6:12:50] lordzocke: the game is insanely fast paced now it’s just a giant brawl
[6:13:03] forshard: it feels like cds used to be more obv. like wings and combust and meta. then they just got fine with cds like dark soul where you just are randomly shitting out more damage
[6:13:11] Talbadar: yeah not great for fresh pvpers
[6:13:18] Junkhole903: so they made all these changes to hp pool and trinket, armor etc. did it actually slow the game down
[6:13:18] Talbadar: BC experience was nice and simple
[6:13:23] RealXrave: rl/x with pika, 0 rated healer to 1600

[6:19:26] dinoman78: I think being a dragon will be better once more gear comes out that looks good
[6:19:29] Aroty: 0% commission even
[6:19:43] tonydeezerpp: just make all of them usable in arena
[6:19:54] forshard: i feel like they were playing with it in s4 AWC when they randomly changed the arena weathers. like i remember people loving the purple kyrian arena
