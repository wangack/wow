[0:26:42] unchainedsoul0: i work 12hrs a day for every 2 weeks of every month babyunAngry
[0:26:48] DrRenedict: I think you also don't have a 'stream character' or maybe you do a bit? Idk you can clarify, I just know 'being someone else' can be extra fatiguing for streamers
[0:27:02] imag1ne_smh: to be able to do something you love and get really good money for it is the perfect job
[0:27:09] perkypeskypirate: so why do you keep canceling your night streams ;(
[0:27:10] nomountain2tall: @drrenedict He is just his acoustic self
[0:27:14] DrRenedict: Yea you feel authentic
[0:27:16] DrRenedict: Acoustic yea
[0:27:18] PabloTescobar26: @nomountain2tall Yeah base ck3 is super empty atm. You can get a bit of time out of some of the mods but even they get boring after a couple of playthroughs

[0:27:51] kaandermaan: might be a personal question, but what are you planning to do after the streaming career?
[0:28:05] FrostBitey10: its easier to be a fake person on youtube than on twitch, at least imo

[0:28:27] Lonelywolfski: OF plan is B
[0:28:27] imag1ne_smh: the only thing fake about tommy is he doesnt scream at people or scream japanese words in public
[0:28:33] imag1ne_smh: kapp
[0:28:44] L4ziik: its better to live in the moment, thats what life is about imo

[0:31:25] imag1ne_smh: if the stream dies, time to become lawyer
[0:31:31] ChaoticFlorius: @TommyKayLIVE That quest sucks KEKW
[0:31:33] Lonelywolfski: I am just waiting for you to flex your streaming on your kid future friends
[0:31:36] nomountain2tall: Your monthly wig subscription is driving up costs too much

[0:32:18] vacerss: You could use homunculi so it's more dps
[0:32:23] Valieriumborn: @TommyKayLIVE you can become a mentor for youngster streamer :D

[0:33:12] listrong7: Trade union for streamers, gotcha :)
[0:33:14] hemspoosey: Promotion
[0:33:16] aluxkang: arent the ghouls in the tomb underground?
[0:33:21] DrRenedict: 10% and we got the deal
[0:33:22] kizelet: i dont think most of these initiatives gain money
[0:33:48] DrRenedict: Alta as fuck
[0:34:00] kizelet: rich ones are managing the big ones, there are not many of them
[0:34:16] Valieriumborn: its the same in the film genre :D Agents take a lot of money xD
[0:34:24] perkypeskypirate: will you be streaming from your retirement home
[0:34:25] sorblex: I would take 50% for nothing, a even better deal - at least for me tommykDRIP
[0:34:31] Sir_Succulant: I need to live to 2077

[1:10:39] Hasmete: The board is carrying the stream tommykLUL
[1:10:39] TheOzarks: How is going your february tho
[1:10:43] nomountain2tall: HOI5 could be good they could introduce more core mechanics and use the newer engine
[1:11:03] FrostBitey10: the hoi4 subscription fee was raised to 7 euros now, i think, which is bullshit imo
[1:11:03] TheOzarks: HOI5 should have a Putin portrait
[1:11:21] eazzyd: 1 sub gifted? Tommy is so over. Dead streamer
[1:11:24] PabloTescobar26: @FrostBitey10 Same with EU4 one
[1:11:26] ChaoticFlorius: @TommyKayLIVE Its a joke about the sub system HOI4 has widepeepoSad
[1:11:34] kikzou: @DrRenedict just an idea, CA would have lot of trouble balancing the thing
[1:11:34] kaandermaan: Sturmwind. Home.
[1:11:49] Cadurana: is there a procentage drop on it?
[1:11:51] The_Yazoo: did you get your engineering trinket?
[1:12:05] zeffff2: @zeffff2 @Cadurana I haven't really been keeping up with the theories but from what I heard EU5 will drop in the next couple years, since they made a team for it
[1:12:05] Cadurana: i've seen it drop like 3 times now. but never won it
[1:12:05] FrostBitey10: @PabloTescobar26 fucking paradox
[1:12:08] PabloTescobar26: @eazzyd KEKW

[1:12:21] TheOzarks: If HOI5 was just HOI4 exactly as it is, but extremely optimized, I would be the happiest person ever
[1:12:27] PabloTescobar26: HE TOOK MY SPOT D:
[1:12:27] aluxkang: giving how the ck3 and vic3 are souless games without any real content comparing to the previous games - we should be happy that hoi4 is what it is
[1:12:32] T1_Draven: Bratt  5 more subs and you can add 1 HOUR OF WOW
[1:12:32] zeffff2: topgifter Pog
[1:12:35] Cadurana: @zeffff2 would be nice, but then again, i just need a dang new pc as i can barely play the one thats out now :D
[1:12:54] Cadurana: Shadow protection ?
[1:13:00] FrostBitey10: hoi5 with the vic 3 warfare system would be bliss Kappa
[1:13:04] HerrBratt: Always enjoying your company while I'm at the desk studying :D @TommyKayLIVE
[1:13:22] ChaoticFlorius: @TommyKayLIVE So like in HOI3
[1:13:30] FrostBitey10: i'd guess that eu5 will be the next paradox game
[1:13:34] zeffff2: @zeffff2 @Cadurana the best part of a new eu game is that there is no dlc bloat yet
[1:13:42] TheOzarks: It would be nice to go up to the cold war even to the 2000s
[1:13:45] rz_e: doesnt the rise of nations mod do that? you can choose to start from 1910 and etc
[1:13:46] JohnTheTurtleMa: JohnTheTurtleMa subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 22 months! 2 years soon

[1:17:51] TheOzarks: Theoretically if someone sent you 10 subgifts and chose to add to the board 1 hour of Roblox, would you be forced to play it?

[1:19:53] ChaoticFlorius: @TommyKayLIVE That was not meant like that KEKW Do what you want
[1:20:23] T1_Draven: @Gavstrav but bannerlord is the same no? you always set the goals yourself e.g. become king or kill person xyz
[1:20:37] Gavstrav: but The Board rules the stream so could always try
[1:20:41] Rot_Zot: !board
[1:20:41] Nightbot: Rot_zot, 10 Gifted Subs for one of these rewards > https://imgur.com/a/Wv8C59O
[1:20:45] mironp: It's good you have 7 hours of outlast
[1:20:55] kizelet: @Gavstrav i think kenshi is exactly the tommys game, too hardcore and competitive, also extensive rpg elements resembling bannerlord
[1:20:58] Rot_Zot: So 10 subs for one hour eache ?
[1:20:59] The_Yazoo: more RE7 hours Praye
[1:21:04] FrostBitey10: maybe the rule should be "if three different people gift 10 subs for one game" THEN it goes on the board
[1:21:05] Cadurana: That's why we need 10 hours on Alian Isolation so we can see him being nervous
[1:21:11] snagdag: SeemsGood
[1:21:19] PabloTescobar26: @Rot_zot 10 subs for anything that isn't TOS or Dota
[1:21:28] Rot_Zot: Ok
[1:21:41] abyssboy6969: why does he walk like that lmao
[1:21:47] T1_Draven: @PabloTescobar26 I am still sad that hes banned in dota, I would willingly go broke for dota content
[1:22:30] mironp: Hold up hold up there is no outlast or amnesia on board wtf happened??????
[1:22:50] Gavstrav: Thing about kenshi is it has a big learning curve so hed need many hours on the board
[1:22:59] PabloTescobar26: @T1_Draven I don't think I've ever watched a single dota game
[1:23:12] The_Bear_U: veryCat

[1:23:50] mironp: Did Tommy delete some things from board??? No outlast, he didn't stream it
[1:23:51] canae: good old apfelstrudel
[1:24:00] kizelet: @Gavstrav in my experience you learn basics easily which you need to know in early game, then you learn how to play late game during playing early and mid
[1:24:14] PabloTescobar26: @mironp He might not have updated the image
[1:24:28] canae: gl for the loot Tommy tommykSheep

[1:25:52] kizelet: @Gavstrav i also wanna play damn
[1:25:53] mironp: Tommy we talked yesterday that it would be fair if you stream at least one hour of every game on board per month, or it's bit unfair to those who donate.. what do you think? @tommykaylive
[1:26:22] PabloTescobar26: KEKW
[1:26:26] V3N00M: dommi kaaay

[3:17:59] FrostBitey10: there are a LOT of people that are way richer than mrbeast that do less than 1% of the philantropy that mrbeast does. people are being mad at the wrong person
[3:18:17] Beardo_1: are they wrong Kappa
[3:18:19] MrWaterB0ttle: Mr Beast's content is dementing the youth. He is breaking their understanding of money and how it is won. the 9 yr old's dream now is to participate in a Mr Beast challenge and not be an astraunaut @TommyKayLIVE
[3:18:22] Slipknoteur: LUL
[3:18:32] bruxseles: I think people that take part in his videos say he is a dickhead

[3:24:09] Beardo_1: legendary 17 pounder Prayge
[3:24:16] usg_ishimura_cpt: starcraft tommy is a goat tbh
[3:24:24] Gavstrav: Tommy is #1 at gaslighting chat
[3:24:29] PurpleGesus: the facts are what I say they are!
[3:24:40] PurpleGesus: and Tommy is the goat
[3:24:40] MaxWeeman: q.e.d.: "quod erat demonstrandum", usualy used when something has been proofen by a demonstration
[3:24:52] maxmullier: I remember you said on the eu4 roleplay game if you got serious in eu4 you could be one of the top players in eu4.
[3:24:52] FrostBitey10: @MaxWeeman NERD
[3:24:54] abugintherug: god I love this ginger
[3:25:04] bighuima: tommy let us shit talk we have nothing else
[3:25:07] PabloTescobar26: I think you should just play a game of starcraft to show how good at games you are Kappa @TommyKayLIVE
[3:25:10] MaxWeeman: By that demonstrating that you are arogant
[3:25:19] MaxWeeman: There again KEKW
[3:25:20] SoAonTwitch: Hey Tommy! Whatcha grinding in SoD?
[3:25:20] prolhty: COPIU
[3:25:23] prolhty: COPIUM
[3:25:32] PabloTescobar26: @SoAonTwitch WSG rep
[3:25:32] maxmullier: there it is
[3:25:42] coldOpposite: the point of hoi4 roleplay is not to take the meta seriously, it's to have fun
[3:25:43] bruxseles: Or saying that current kids dont have APM, While avrage 10y old in fortnite plays the game that me or you cant even comprehand whats going on @TommyKayLIVE
[3:25:43] rnk71: Any thoughts on hamilton to ferrari?

[3:26:42] PabloTescobar26: I'd rather watch tennis KEKW
[3:26:43] mironp: F1 is in circles??? KEKW
[3:26:46] unicronboi: as a briton, I never understood continental obsession with F1
[3:27:03] bruxseles: you can say that for every sport
[3:27:03] Lt_milly: ALOOO
[3:27:10] listrong7: F1 is fun to watch only when crashes happen. Sad, but it is what it is..
[3:27:18] rodakowsky4152: @listrong7 Na bro
[3:27:18] FrostBitey10: F1 is incredible when there is actual competition
[3:27:24] rodakowsky4152: @FrostBitey10 facts !!
[3:27:36] FrostBitey10: @listrong7 thats nascar dumb logic, i'm sorry
[3:28:00] PabloTescobar26: NASCAR is the best KKona
[3:28:14] Interstace: KEKW
[3:28:28] mironp: they are not driving in circles what are you talking about??? KEKW
[3:28:28] maxmullier: @pablotescobar26 it does not even compare pls, pls dont put them together
[3:28:29] bruxseles: UFc is boring beacuse man smear their balls across eachother faces
[3:28:32] MaxWeeman: Boxing is boring bc they drive in circles PepegaChat
[3:28:42] bruxseles: Football is boring beacuse 22 men run after a ball
[3:28:49] FrostBitey10: nascar is actually driving in circles. F1 is more complicated than that
[3:28:53] rodakowsky4152: tommykSheep
[3:29:00] PabloTescobar26: @maxmullier But they steer to the left sometimes in NASCAR
[3:29:00] Rot_Zot: Never go full retard
[3:29:01] OctaviusPHD: Grats Brux Clap
[3:29:15] Lt_milly: Clap
[3:29:16] bruxseles: There is more behind F1 than riding in circles
[3:29:25] unicronboi: @FrostBitey10 yeah, the circle is...asymmetrical tommykPOGGER
[3:29:25] MrWaterB0ttle: Have you seen Isle of Man TT races ? Those guys have massive balls
[3:29:26] listrong7: @FrostBitey10 is there like difference in Formulas or what, what determines someones skill in F1?
[3:29:35] Lolmeagainkek: KEKW
[3:29:36] abugintherug: muh slipstreams
[3:29:36] kozbringerl: we need pit boys
[3:29:36] rodakowsky4152: i think u have to be deep in f1 to be a fan
[3:29:36] bruxseles: im not even a fan of that but thats the truth every sport has something behind it
[3:29:46] mahomm14: Pollution Kappa
[3:29:47] dazbug2005: Formula one is the perfect sport to fall asleep to
[3:29:51] Beardo_1: pitMEN Gayge
[3:29:54] MaxWeeman: F1 is literally driving in a cirlce, just bc it does not look like a circle does not mean that its not a circle
[3:29:54] bruxseles: saying its bad and giving the most basic explanation is arogance
[3:30:00] unicronboi: do you have any thoughts on snooker Tommy?
[3:30:01] maxmullier: @pablotescobar26 yes
[3:30:01] PabloTescobar26: Football is the best sport end of discussion
[3:30:05] Lt_milly: true
[3:30:29] kozbringerl: nfl is the most entertaining
[3:30:31] rodakowsky4152: @PabloTescobar26 factsssss
[3:30:36] Dreadnought628: ever since they f1xed it for verstappen to win his first championship its been terrible
[3:30:36] mironp: I think if a car race requires you to be in top physical condition to be able to compete it is pretty cool
[3:30:42] ArghFx: Cheer1 you played zomboid yet today? LUL
[3:30:43] maxmullier: @fistooooooooo that is hurtful
[3:30:46] PabloTescobar26: @maxmullier Nah honestly I don't watch either. The only NASCAR related thing I watch is Talledega Nights LUL
[3:30:49] bruxseles: What i said about UFC is same shit you did about f1 a basic Rtarded reason to shit on a sport
[3:31:00] OctaviusPHD: KEKW

[3:31:13] bighuima: Pog peak NFL Content
[3:31:14] Rot_Zot: KEKW
[3:31:15] FrostBitey10: @listrong7 racing skill determines skill in F1. some drivers are just faster and better than the others. but it's also a combination of that and engineering. engineers compete against eachother
[3:31:15] MaxWeeman: Actually true
[3:31:17] bigbeat12: tommykGASM
[3:31:21] Rot_Zot: Chicken Nuggets

[3:31:52] kizelet: if they would offer you 500k for a year, would you stream on Kick?
[3:31:58] abugintherug: skill issue
[3:32:09] listrong7: @FrostBitey10 but it isn't drivers being faster it's formulas(the machine) being faster, so engineers should be praised and not the drivers?
[3:32:14] bruxseles: Now they stream it on european media with almost no comercials btw
[3:32:18] dazbug2005: What are your thoughts on rugby Tommy
[3:32:19] rodakowsky4152: hey tommy u got all hoi  achievements?
[3:32:20] croat1: she sounds cool

[3:32:34] cheesemanbutthegoodone: i just went to eat lunch what did  i miss
[3:32:40] aidan_mcclure: Tommy if you moved to the USA which state or which city would you live in
[3:32:52] maxmullier: A bit dumb of me to judge
[3:32:55] matty_2599: dev diary tonight?
[3:32:55] FrostBitey10: @listrong7 its a combination. you can have a great car, but that car will only be as good as the driver is. thats why you need the best driver if you have a great car. realistically they should both be praised
[3:33:07] PurpleGesus: @tommykaylive subs great dads…. but, the ones without children… whew. rough group of children here. haha
[3:33:17] rodakowsky4152: are you doing an achievement grind again?
[3:33:36] PabloTescobar26: @maxmullier It seems like a very braindead sport imo. If you're asking about Talladega Nights it's a comedy movie about a NASCAR driver
[3:33:43] maxmullier: @tommykaylive no dont worry we want more WOW

[3:37:43] kireal07: that what u like for ur bday
[3:37:46] FrostBitey10: fifa 18 made me quit fifa, that game was fucking horrible
