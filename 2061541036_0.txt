[1:09:21] anaya909: !eu
[1:09:42] anaya909: well there's usually a command lol.  but he plays eu because their peak hours line up better with this irl schedule

[1:40:45] JackBurton176: @zerahaha  might be practice
[1:41:47] JackBurton176: @jdotb reroll means to get rid of a key and hopefully get something different?
[1:42:36] JackBurton176: @jdotb can you share why you use the tank trinket?
[1:43:20] zerahaha: @JackBurton176 its a defensive cd that says "you cannot die for 15s" that also does a lot of dps
[1:43:24] touchpanel12: why no cultivation
[1:43:25] sweexie: @JackBurton176 , if you time a key you, other players can reroll their key if the timed run was at least the same level as the key in the bag :)
[1:44:07] JackBurton176: @zerahaha  many thanks

[1:51:01] Rypick: @jdotb do you think for resto druid you should be rolling as resto or boomkin for great vault weeks
[1:55:58] FLUFFALOBUFFALO: yo
[1:58:21] Piaggio: limit testing 5Head
[1:58:22] Lara_TV_: given my pug experience, I think that's exactly the reason
[2:01:54] Lara_TV_: Lmao you weren't even close to him
[2:02:26] Vixx0: chat, what is it that he presses whenever he respawns?
[2:02:39] Lara_TV_: @Vixx0 Augment Rune
[2:02:43] Vixx0: ah
[2:09:55] typ2diabeedus73: why is this the last day to push fort? all other weeks are crap?
[2:11:35] Lara_TV_: Nah, it's just the last day of this week. Technically the best week is in ~6weeks, storming/bursting.
[2:11:54] devilhawk83: today for NA is actually decent with Tyrannical, Storming and Raging @typ2diabeedus73 next week is Fortified, Entangling and Bolstering
[2:16:21] Lara_TV_: Are your gray bars for absorbs from Elvui? or a  WA?
[2:19:17] Rypick: @jdotb do you think for resto druid you should be rolling as resto or boomkin for great vault weeks
[2:22:41] brewteafulgaming: Hi all
[2:25:05] Vixx0: @rypick literally depends on what you need. Roll balance if you need something that only drops for that spec like the trinket off of twindel. If not, it doesn't matter. If ur asking him specifically, I don't think j needs anything, I believe he has all the gear he wants on this toon.
[2:28:49] devilhawk83: chrysCry RIP internet
[2:29:01] JacobBose: Hopefully its just the stream lol
[2:29:13] devilhawk83: hopefully
