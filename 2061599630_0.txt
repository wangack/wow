[2:14:15] entropy_reigns: i'm a solid skiier. i grew up on it, my dad was an instructor. i can ski circles around most people. but i'm a dumpster tier snowboarder.
[2:14:20] Stricken79: I shall celebrate valentines byu playing wow...alone naguuraSip
[2:14:43] vharakh_17: dressing up nicely on the 15th D:
[2:14:48] Exodiiac: @Stricken79 seems about right xd
[2:15:42] entropy_reigns: you rarely tell us what kinds of coffee you prefer? want to?
[2:16:54] Exodiiac: Do you have a barista machine?
[2:17:31] delikatlp: servus
[2:17:37] Exodiiac: barista is like they have in the coffee shops
[2:18:01] itsClubby: karagiWiggle
[2:18:18] ellasky: i have a breville machine and I couldn't live without it lol
[2:18:27] dunpeal: brevillle is rock
[2:18:31] Sebleh: I saw this clip about affogatos and now I want an espresso machine for the occasional espresso but they’re so expensive and I agree annoying to clean.
[2:18:35] Exodiiac: which one ellasky ?
[2:18:38] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[2:18:42] Sebleh: but also I mostly just prefer regular coffee
[2:18:51] ellasky: @Exodiiac the barista express
[2:18:56] itsClubby: that looks so nice
[2:19:16] Exodiiac: @ellasky currently thinking of buying a machine. trying to decide on what to buy
[2:19:18] faulen: and how good you are at pulling a shot
[2:19:18] dunpeal: breville bes880
[2:19:25] Alepooo: 150 euros not bad
[2:19:29] Burningwish: you need to know how to use it and the coffee itself has different temperatures and pressures
[2:19:33] Alepooo: normal moccamaster costs 200 euros
[2:19:39] Akahashy: rather pay 2 euros for coffee kekw
[2:19:41] Coffeeguru: I'll stick wit the good old moccamaser LUL
[2:20:13] ellasky: @Exodiiac the breville express is a solid pick, it's considered an entry-level machine but imo it gets the job done if you're just looking for a solid all-in-one setup
[2:20:17] Rontarmxd: spanish music GoatEmotey GoatEmotey
[2:20:31] faulen: we call it Drip coffee in the States
[2:20:38] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:20:46] Exodiiac: @ellasky isnt this one comes with a grinder built-in ? is it good ?
[2:21:14] Burningwish: do you know how to make good expresso? youir mother has a bar right?
[2:21:18] Alepooo: i only drink drip coffee at home then
[2:21:19] Alepooo: xD
[2:21:23] ellasky: @Exodiiac Yep it does, the grinder is very decent!
[2:21:37] dunpeal: I have been using the Breville BES880 Touch model for 2 years and I am very happy with that.
[2:21:38] Stricken79: I have a pod espresso machine from the supermarket widepeepoCoffee
[2:21:48] everybodygetsbees: we had one of those at the office
[2:21:50] Alepooo: we dont have capsules
[2:22:03] Alepooo: we have like a bag of coffee grounded
[2:22:14] bors1992: @Naguura have some videos in internet how to fill custom capsules
[2:22:15] Exodiiac: i honestly never enjoyed a capsule coffee machine. it is below average at best XD
[2:22:15] mejiro151: coffee is stale in those pods
[2:22:31] artisham_: You can buy reusable capsules and use your favorite coffee XD
[2:22:35] Sebleh: yeah Keurig machines are absolute unsanitary AF
[2:22:42] Sebleh: and just disgusting in general
[2:22:47] anjazell: they have a recycling program
[2:22:48] Stricken79: the problem with capsules is price, you can get a kg of coffee beans for cheap as compared to like a 10 pack of pods
[2:22:59] Exodiiac: @ellasky I currently been looking on a grinder and machine separated. might consider the breville experss
[2:23:02] fivaldrood: All coffee is bad, start your day with a vodka like a real adult
[2:23:13] bors1992: No hero in a DHT 28 this will be funny
[2:23:16] Sebleh: Nespresso capsules are much cleaner at least but it’s like $1+ per capsule IE coffee so you’re essentially paying $1-2 to make coffee at home.
[2:23:30] marcusallansson: never been a coffee drinker, i maybe have like one a year
[2:23:34] xsetikx: what does a hissing rune do exactly
[2:23:37] dunpeal: Illy bean coffee and a proper barista machine is deadly combo
[2:24:05] JohnAllenCasts: I got a capsule machine for christmas that's pretty good. It's about £5 for 16 pods
[2:24:13] Sebleh: oh yeah the different flavor or drink capsules are awesome
[2:24:19] bors1992: Here in Brazil we're masters of coffee produce, so we have some anothers brands machines with another kind of capsules veeeery much cheaper.
[2:24:19] OviTheGray: grippi8CatHype grippi8CatHype grippi8CatHype

[2:25:44] RadioFAQtiveDan: my GF is carrying her capsule machine with her on most of our vacations - so the mobility is a plus too(i guess?:D)
[2:25:45] bors1992: Nobody used hero D:
[2:25:56] Stricken79: wow NA has been down for 1.5 hours and not even a realm list yet :\
[2:26:11] Stricken79: do they need 3 gd hours today for maintenance ?
[2:26:40] Stricken79: YEP

[2:26:44] speedyysl: ya they are down still
[2:26:46] Deyconn: another 30 mins or so

[2:26:59] iamjrn: was only a 2 hour but usually goes up like 20-30 early
[2:27:06] Sebleh: probably unexpected issues
[2:27:14] warryvibe: WidestJigglin
[2:27:16] Stricken79: I'm praying for a pips today, but it is greedy since I got a gd ember last week
[2:27:22] Sebleh: they are probably prepping for 10.2.6
[2:27:22] bors1992: they're pushing 10.2.6 kekw
[2:27:34] anjazell: it’s planned, banners been up for a few days
[2:28:03] Stricken79: is hero track pips even better than a gd might of the ocean mythic track ? monkaHmm

[2:40:10] CriticalFalcon: @Naguura New to boomie here. how do i know which build to use in each dungeon? I see like 3-4 different builds and confused on how to pick
[2:40:38] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:40:39] chicagoaces: @Stricken79 i think its worth to do if you're resto but i think its not worth for dps druids to do imo
[2:40:58] Stricken79: @chicagoaces I see NODDERS
[2:42:45] Sebleh: seblehJam seblehJam
[2:43:16] Sebleh: @chicagoaces the damage you take as DPS trying to clear them is absolutely not worth the damage loss from clearing it.
[2:44:37] warrioroulis: boomie is so weak this patch?
[2:45:30] Lenietwitch: bearweaving naguuraW naguuraBear
[2:45:37] Lenietwitch: @warrioroulis is not weak :P
[2:45:47] Stricken79: boomie is not weak, it's just that naguura is bad naguuraGiggle
[2:45:52] Stricken79: Kappa
[2:45:55] marcusallansson: @Lenietwitch depends on the content you're referring to
[2:46:19] marcusallansson: boomie is bottom 3 dps in raid, but people who know the class can still pump hard
[2:46:19] Sebleh: @warrioroulis it’s not weak just has bad defensive ability.
[2:46:23] Lenietwitch: @marcusallansson ok mr actually, we are watching m+, that's the context
[2:46:25] chicagoaces: boomie def does damage but its made of glass most of the time since most druids dont know what bear form is
[2:46:29] Ditysalad: bad pad
[2:47:11] marcusallansson: lmao
[2:47:17] Freddyfx36: is balance druid easy to pick up as a first timer, if i have experiece on mage and warlock?
[2:47:39] Stricken79: idk when one spec of mage is not gonna be better than a moonkin, I seen a fire mage clear a 31 with all their shields and defensives
[2:47:46] Sebleh: does starfire on 3 targets hit the main target for less than a wrath with the right eclipses tho?
[2:47:48] Ditysalad: what about resource regen from sunfire on them?
[2:48:01] anjazell: swapping between the eclipses can be tricky
[2:48:11] Uchiha_Cloaky: Ohayo snupyHey snupyHey PopNemo
[2:48:13] Lenietwitch: @Freddyfx36 i think so, if you have exp on any caster, boomie is easy to pick imo

[2:53:54] tepkwon: Well, what else does boomie bring 🤣
[2:53:55] Nocturne118: Yes but number bigger
[2:53:56] Bloodbottler_88: Yes, that is exactly how it goes. Also, your details screens need to cover 50% of your screen.

[2:54:49] maiiisan18: idk I see dorki do both and puuuump

[2:55:03] RadioFAQtiveDan: there is this darklegacy comic where all classes does the same dmg and they want to rename their classes because the meters are in alphabetical order :D
[2:55:03] Sebleh: it’s kinda padding tho

[5:10:47] Sebleh: what about bimbi pesto?
[5:10:48] Kuroz: tuna might be a bit too much but it's a taste thing
[5:11:31] Andersonmps: Rise
[5:11:33] Sebleh: timing a higher key is a good way naguuraSip
[5:11:41] Sebleh: rise 27 I think
[5:12:47] Sebleh: where was that?
[5:12:57] Sebleh: so I can give it activity and it gets pushed to the front page
[5:13:58] miaemil: any tips on doing +25’s? this is the first season I try to push past 20’s
[5:14:24] Andersonmps: Believe!
[5:14:43] miaemil: I’ve done some 23-24s and feel like I spend half the dungeon in bear form
[5:14:46] the_lootgoblin: its easy
[5:14:51] the_lootgoblin: just dont do dumb shit
[5:14:57] the_lootgoblin: xD
[5:15:19] the_lootgoblin: as a healer i dont heal stupid
[5:15:38] Ragnaratos: @Naguura I sometimes feel so bad dps-wise compared to Ret, havoc and Outlaw in M+ BibleThump  ist this normal?
[5:15:40] Sebleh: 25s this season are like a regular 22.
[5:16:12] Sebleh: @ragnaratos you have no burst. you’re comparing yourself to burst classes. they have better burst cleave so if things die too fast they’ll stomp you every time.
[5:17:21] Ragnaratos: but even in 24 or 25, if I try to perfectly lign in pulsar
[5:17:42] NkKouros: Shadow last season was the same .until 27-28 keys the fire mages are killing all in 20 sec with flamestrike
[5:17:42] Sebleh: smart
[5:18:01] miaemil: thoughts on weaver vs rattle in higher keys?

[5:21:54] Vendrek: I spent over a month farming the Lunarblight Trousers...I got lucky on RNG...
[5:22:10] miaemil: I play with 2 premade dps and they play very bursty classes so I’ve been considering weaver for the slight more prio damage
[5:22:10] Sebleh: up to* 200
[5:22:12] Vendrek: Could take 6 months or more
[5:22:32] Sebleh: I might play with the numbers a bit still naguuraSip
