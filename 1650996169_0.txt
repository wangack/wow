[3:21:15] Wvanp: isnt the gear from old content (including these boxes)usely outdated after u did the quests in the new expansion? srry havnt played for a couple years
[3:21:26] FitzFlips: thats the 100% way to go @Swifty gear that Draggo up and get them all!"!!

[3:23:09] Wvanp: @Cybernytez been thinking to maybe return to wow the new expansion.... but if people alrdy can get ahead this way i dunno :S
[3:23:47] mutorblind: thats a lot of grinding to get 30
[3:24:11] Jasonhawkblood: @Wvanp the current gear we have does not matter at 70. It just makes leveling easier for like 6 or 7 of the levels.
[3:24:23] fracktv: where do you get those boxes?
[3:24:23] shawnquesty: I'm gonna lvl a drakthy on Tuesday

[3:25:33] atoker: 1950 is 7
[3:25:39] FitzFlips: at 1900 you 7/9

[3:26:26] Wvanp: @Jasonhawkblood @Cybernytez for the new expansion pvp wise what would you thiunk i should play? rogue/warlock/druid these are the 3 i usely like
[3:26:42] sandvei: Why are you doning prto war and prot pally?
[3:26:49] Robchew: This is in game Oribos music? No way. WotLK?
[3:26:57] DrongoLightning: @iiamsly the vendor next to flight master in Oribnos
[3:27:07] BoricuaSJ: BTW did you hear a boom this morning? it was the X37B landing
[3:27:10] Robchew: Great thx
[3:27:12] Jasonhawkblood: @Wvanp tuning is still very in the air. I would go with what you find most fun/has the most experience with and just decide as you go.
[3:27:16] FitzFlips: Ret Pala is the way to go. you power house AND you got LAY ON HANDS in arena!!! you can off heal Bop and nuke!
[3:27:17] Dudutoolbox: it's the music from the varian grave in stormwind i believe
[3:27:23] a_loof: sounds like BFA music
[3:27:23] Robchew: Sounds nordic, so prolly wotlk
[3:27:29] fro2476: isn't the level cap going up to 70? won't those loot boxes be level 60 gear?
[3:27:31] Glowfu: Its from legion i think
[3:27:37] Shockyjoe: Thats the music from the grave in stormwind
[3:27:44] Cybernytez: @Wvanp  nobody can really say what will be good ^^ the classes that are best sat the start usually get nerfed pretty quick so if anybody tells you whats good or best its already false
[3:27:56] Robchew: Is there a title or something?
[3:28:01] Wvanp: @Jasonhawkblood i played wow for 12 years orso have exp in all classes rly, just been away for a couple years so dont know which is strong or weak rly anymore
[3:28:12] Xaviwan078: the music is from wotlk

[3:30:43] Laaurris: SeemsGood
[3:30:45] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://go.corsair.com/LP9zBa
[3:30:45] Cybernytez: @Wvanp right now Affli Lock is outta control overpowered but this is Prepatch right now and it will not be so broken as it is right now, so like i said classes being OP at start is not good because they end up gettin nerfed hard
[3:30:55] Dudutoolbox: question, what do i do with my upgraded blue pvp gear once i get conquest gear? Do i just throw it away?
[3:30:55] Haukah: all specs

[3:32:38] BaronKendrick: my Bandolier and Brockade
[3:32:47] Wvanp: @Cybernytez ye its gonna be rogue or lock with more intention to roque for world pvp purpose also :p
[3:32:54] Dudutoolbox: these people dont care about points
[3:33:05] Xaviwan078: rage quit are toxic in wow ocomplete waste of time in pve to like mythic plus
[3:33:14] greys666: dis is mad people

[3:33:51] Cowardpatty: If they quit, give them a 5 day debuff
[3:34:18] eiknarf95: I had someone rage quit because they weren‚Äôt gonna gain rating‚Ä¶ like what
[3:34:25] triuxtv: week long deserter debuff after 3 rage quits
[3:34:30] Dudutoolbox: punish hard leavers but reward players who dont leave
[3:34:41] headlocks000: how else would you penalize it, if taking rating isn't the way?
[3:34:45] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:34:58] frosty78: insta rating reset then?

[3:35:11] nargathronic: Give deserters 24 hours ban :)
[3:35:33] ffejaywarrior: could they make it where you just plain can't leave?
[3:35:39] eiknarf95: If I get 1400 rating from solo shuffle can I buy crates? I haven‚Äôt done any season 4 pvp and this is currently ‚Äúpost season‚Äù
[3:35:42] Wvanp: no honor/conquest gain for the week for ragequiters
[3:35:45] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://go.corsair.com/LP9zBa
[3:35:48] johngalang6: why not just have an option to reset your rating to zero?
[3:35:49] Dudutoolbox: exactly
[3:35:59] Cybernytez: yeah its big time waste
[3:36:09] bikkss: what was that box you were farming for=
[3:36:15] Cybernytez: and some games are really hard and you fight for nothing is pretty sad
[3:36:20] au_chilli: Imagine something in WoW being a total waste of time üòÇ
[3:36:39] druagh: @swifty rage quite should lose honor and conquest
[3:36:40] HorribleHarry71: theres really no solution they could just sit in the arena and not even attck much and u still lose
[3:37:02] frosty78: i meant in the sense of an NPC next to the pvp vendor that you can interact with, and request to reset rating or of some sort.
[3:37:08] BlitzcominTwitch: realistically it should turn into 2v3 with the leftovers, but no or % of rating change from begining games
[3:37:15] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
