[1:51:49] desmo7: did you watch the kanye west one

[1:54:15] osatox: or...they can push Q4 sales and numbers
[1:54:17] Libbzy: Just got the headless horseman's mount after 87 attempts!
[1:54:18] Domi98_: they r cucking themselves by overlappin wow hype
[1:54:42] BramishEU: Theyre cutting off their nose to spite their face @towelliee , i dont play classic but i dont get it
[1:54:49] Aquadriel: because fuck classic
[1:55:00] royhandlesit: because classic is dumb
[1:55:00] liqpd: Q4 SALES IS THE REASON
[1:55:01] Spaede: meaningful choice!
[1:55:03] swampt1l: Classic Andy’s 4Head
[1:55:03] xApplemaNx: omfg this is the 11th set of adds twitch why
[1:55:16] E_mark: They might view it as two separate communities that don't overlap
[1:55:19] sprert: On the other hand a earlier naxx means an earlier tbc @Towelliee
[1:55:25] Warcraftthor: they should release it in January
[1:55:26] Grunton: more sales with clasic you just get a sub
[1:55:27] pedrodepacas1: its hard to not overshadow classic when new tier releases are cleared in under 2h
[1:55:33] papaPathos: because classic is only secondary. retail is the focus and we have a clash now. the sensible thing would be to delay naxxramas of course, but I guess blizz simply doesnt care.
[1:55:35] ShadoodHD: two separate communities that came from the same root NotLikeThis
[1:55:35] Vealzy: do you think people will be less mad if they delay Naxx until January or something? i kinda have a feeling that will also piss them off
[1:55:40] Villie: thats not true i like both
[1:56:03] Tysaur: i dont think blizz know what an mmo is Kappa
[1:56:14] swordart_19: Majority retail players don't give a single fuck about classic
[1:56:18] Aquadriel: the ammount of people that dedicates hardcore to both has to be less than 0.1%

[1:57:05] Tigerklaue: he plays classic once a week
[1:57:09] R3b3l_jme: thing is classic atm is only raid logging so it wont be as bad as you think
[1:57:11] FatChase: I honestly think he'll play Retail over classic
[1:57:13] RustproofSage: Maybe SL launch will be postponed again ;D
[1:57:13] elderikp: didn't know he really played retail
[1:57:19] Aquadriel: asmongold gonna do 1 stream of naxx for content and go back to retail and you know it @Towelliee
[1:57:20] Shrandamar: Asmon doesnt really wanna stream classic anymore
[1:57:22] loenskov798: asmon will play retail over classic def
[1:57:24] warlorddraks: hey towelliee looking for a new set of headphones what you choosing now a days

[1:57:27] SaltywankeR: from a team pov i think he will do it all ?
[1:57:31] BramishEU: Asmon is a retail guy
[1:57:34] TheUnknowing: nax 40 will be like every other classic raid so far, it will get nuked, may take a bit longer with how big it is but its going to be rekt
[1:57:45] prairydog: catJAM
[1:57:49] Grunton: clasic will always be there last raid not like more is coming to the game
[1:57:55] MightyKeyboard: @towelliee not trolling but have you been lifting weights your shoulders look bigger
[1:58:25] StateFarm206: Tim wants to play Shadowlands

[1:59:10] farlap: osatox missya6LUV
[1:59:11] gooseboy429: lirik is going alliance in shadowlands
[1:59:12] ktrain92: could be pressure from the corporate side to push this stuff out now before the end of year
[1:59:13] osatox: with COVID and the initial delay that kinda shot themselves in the foot
[1:59:15] Domi98_: I think this naxx date was for the old shadowlands release
[1:59:21] StateFarm206: @MightyKeyboard lol tim is far from that
[1:59:25] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee I think they just want to keep players in WoW as a whole, and not in other games that are coming out
[1:59:27] TheUnknowing: Naxx out so we can move on to a good classic, classic tbc Kappa
[1:59:31] elderikp: that 40% movement speed thral
[1:59:32] osatox: @farlap HeyGuys
[1:59:34] swordart_19: You just worry about streamers KEKW
[1:59:37] Thenortherngeek: maybe they are going off of the old SL release date

[2:00:13] TheUnknowing: I think its possible
[2:00:13] papaPathos: naxx was set time-schedulde wise and SL just moved to it. but they still didnt consider naxx at all.
[2:00:24] ottavianni: its posible that retail stepd on wow clasic time release
[2:00:38] snorky29: i have to say leveling is great at the moment :)
[2:00:48] StateFarm206: my family knows ill be in my room for holidays this year lol
[2:00:49] SaltywankeR: all games aim to avoid release day clash
[2:00:52] pedrodepacas1: i think this SL release date is what blizzard wanted all along and activision pushed it earlier for $. having trhe release on the anniversary of the launch of the game seems like a reasonable thing for them to want
[2:00:53] hippieslayer29: you have xbox and playstation releasing also
[2:00:55] warrenny: You mean activision Kappa

[2:24:21] RolfonZin: wtf where :O
[2:24:27] Tysaur: undercity
[2:24:40] Sprucemoose: heirloom vendor. they are books, google it

[2:25:02] Malindan: @sprucemoose I can get fps from heirlooms? towFeelsgood
[2:25:06] Avinar: I wish I could queue for all xpacs dungeons separately without being in that specific chromie time.
[2:25:07] Malarick: if Im on an alt, do I need to do the Nazjatar intro quests if I have a 60 already?
[2:25:07] Tysaur: the lvl 10 mage dps tho is insane
[2:25:08] Raedari: Legion has been worse. Maw of Souls is pretty much broken to where you cant finish lol

[2:46:03] mizerboy: hunter
[2:46:07] StateFarm206: I just want boomie to be good in raids
[2:46:09] Raaeni: enh conduits are already so bad its better to skip a potency slot LUL
[2:46:11] brandon_tapartos: @dasna95 boomkin
[2:46:14] StateFarm206: so im not sitting on the bench
[2:46:28] dasna95: @tapartos really??
[2:46:40] brandon_tapartos: yep
[2:46:50] Raaeni: always llock/mage
[2:46:56] Doowop: I just want to enjoy the game without raids and dungeons.
[2:46:59] trinita289: Yup nerf paladins to the groud :)
[2:47:00] Phalian01: My take. SL release prot pala will grow most tanks will go prot pala
[2:47:02] MuttonChopins: even ret pallys or just prot?
[2:47:10] Avinar: @wheeellz nowadays its maybe 2% or less damage. it's super close it doesn't matter, than before where horde had some useful big deal ones.
[2:47:18] Phalian01: Ret is oke but also nerfed
[2:47:21] qtceef: oh he was pooomping
[2:47:31] dasna95: @tapartos I've heard boomies and in the middele of the pact regarding legos etc. Then the final tuning etc isn't done ofc
[2:47:39] dasna95: are*
[2:47:50] Avinar: none of the covenants seemed really good for my ret when I tried them out but idk about now
[2:48:00] Affiiance: Boomie is just annoying to play now in SL
[2:48:07] dasna95: @tapartos mages and hunters are always solid and locks are always good in raids
[2:48:11] Doowop: Covenant for mage?
[2:48:14] Rulsuz: Is leveling harder or easier compared to the old version?
[2:48:31] Electhoria_Inzo: easier

[2:49:10] RichterrTV: What about Iceland??
[2:49:11] Dustmanxxx: Ive been out of wow for quite some time. So the new system is interesting.
[2:49:13] MOLAR305: do you see utilitiy for necrolord as Brew? double shield?
[2:49:13] Aro725: I thought ret always slapped at the beginning. Then one shots ppl in pvp and gets nerfed to hell lol
[2:49:24] Avinar: well with ice Lance nerfed HARD is ice Lance still as good?
[2:49:24] StateFarm206: Ice lance will always be top damage for frost

[3:29:08] Brodih_: he died at 90 so we had a good life
[3:29:11] Aeylid: 16% @MrGattz
[3:29:12] DryR: herbs are denser in BFA zones
[3:29:15] Aeylid: cuz 16 years lol
[3:29:15] MrGattz: what an odd number...
[3:29:19] MrGattz: oh.
[3:29:21] MrGattz: i guess..
[3:29:29] nenadx: leveled up from 110 to 120 with herb
[3:29:31] Aeylid: they always do the % of the amount of years
[3:29:43] UberManDude: @Towelliee Do you think the reason Blizz announced the expansion is because of Cyberpunk pushing their release date?
[3:29:46] StateFarm206: As a druid im about to just herb/mine lol and see how far i can get to 50 from 10
[3:29:48] geokouts: Sean died in his sleep. SO natural causes
[3:29:55] Aeylid: easy sauce
[3:29:57] Zavier420: lol
[3:30:20] MILESkg21: Maybe Kappa
[3:30:22] Aeylid: by then alliance warmode should be like 75% right :)
[3:30:28] Avinar: when leveling is 2 hours to hit max Kappa
[3:30:43] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning Hammer Squad @towelliee
[3:30:48] Avinar: man I feel bad for people like esfand who want to do both

[3:31:28] kofijuve: would you take Cata over Mop?
[3:31:40] Avinar: he will at least level in his off time from raid stuff I'd imagine
[3:31:48] UberManDude: @Towelliee Think about it. Lot of people thought SL would have came out in December. As soon Cyberpunk push their release date to December, that is when Blizz announced NOV release date? Nah, illumanti confirmed for real. lol
[3:31:50] yeaahyeah: BabyRage I need to play both games for 40 hours a day
[3:31:56] MILESkg21: Cata was great until DS happened

[3:33:23] StateFarm206: Isnt mythic 0 daily ?
[3:33:24] Avinar: I still haven't looked into the professions in sl

[6:55:21] PvtHudson093: i just look at my following page and who's live at the time for who i watch
[6:55:23] BuddySinister: Anyone else notice recently twitch chat doesn't update? Seems I have to refresh a few times throughout a stream
[6:55:23] Thoreya: I think people just hate notifications in general
[6:55:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: Even youtube notifies me better artoSmug
[6:55:26] LadyJasmin: when you follow now it auto turns on. i only let 5 streamers notify me
[6:55:27] Cazkain: he only bad thing with alot of subs you will not read all like this one
[6:55:29] Thoreya: Shit blows up phones
[6:55:41] datcreepa: LUL

[6:55:47] yunggluten: Blows up my phone BIG TIME LUL
[6:55:59] Brodih_: i did not even know that existed
[6:56:10] MysticalOS: yeah because of push notificcations on phones I had to pretty much turn all notifications off for all streamers ecept for ones that are rare. basically, scheduled streams I don't need notification, I know they are on
[6:56:17] fewyn: yeah i don't click the notifications
[6:56:19] VarkanosGaming: all the twich stream i follow, I have it on and none notify me
[6:56:21] Azphelle: woRkINg As INteNdeD
[6:56:22] fewyn: because they are annoying
[6:56:24] KrimsonElite: I am one of those 154 WOOT
[6:56:30] mikejames01: most of the time it does not pop up for me
[6:56:33] Puhtehdough: @Thoreya Was about to say that. If you reinstall twitch app, ALL of your followers have notifications when they go live
[6:56:36] grizzlyhorn: i always see it but never click it, i just go to your channel when i see it
[6:56:36] datcreepa: i just rely on discord
[6:56:39] D3m0nHunt3r666: It's just too spammy
[6:56:40] s_t_o_r_m__: that notification is like 2 seconds on screen lol
[6:56:41] JoeyBagadonuts: I see that and I assume I got an hour until your on
[6:56:47] Gorbungus: It disappears way too soon to react to it.
[6:56:49] PvtHudson093: I see your discord notification and i tune in
[6:56:49] Thoreya: @puhtehdough yeah it’s super annoying
[6:56:49] outbreak2005: Its super spammy
[6:57:02] Stargazer27: we dont like notifications
[6:57:04] lekkahdh: I have it turned on on my phone, be rarely click it LUL
[6:57:09] LadyJasmin: ok i am asleep so i don't come on then. i watch when i get up and then the vod. since i sub i don't get the ads
[6:57:10] MOLAR305: I wonder how good discord is for that
[6:57:18] suntoleja: @Towelliee I always just swipe away notification on my phone and turn on stream on PC
[6:57:23] Stradivarii: I'm usually at work :P
[6:57:26] Xailen: perhaps quite a few know you have a 45 min average startup time so they wait. lol Kappa
[6:57:44] hardcorl: i have 58 lol
[6:57:48] ArcaneMaki: I don't want to see EVERY single streamers I follow go live. I use it on just a few. I follow sometimes as support, not necessary because I want to watch all their streams.
[6:57:50] XshadowturkeyX: ima jsut tell you this everyoen i follow i have it to auto turn on notifications have it to popup on any tab im on for any stream i follow , i follow over 500 channles i hardly see any going live notification, twitch sucks
[6:58:04] R2RHIN0: Did you make the other announcements yet Towelliee?
[6:58:04] datcreepa: pruning the fat
[6:58:11] N3llee: 6 not liek 2?
[6:58:14] MysticalOS: yeah every one i follow notifications are on by default, the VERY first thing I do is turn t hat off :D
[6:58:21] LadyJasmin: yes 5 or 6 if they don't view your channel they lose the follow
[6:58:22] sarcilav: doesn';t it include unique monthly viewers or so? similar to the stats that are shown for websites?
[6:58:28] lekkahdh: a year or 2 sounds way better
[6:58:44] ArcaneMaki: My hammer disappeared for a while
[6:58:46] jezaknight93: thats the only reason i dont have them on
[6:58:54] s_t_o_r_m__: you already can do that btw, list of notifications

[6:59:09] LadyJasmin: that's what i do. i turn off the notifications so that only the ones that matter beep me
[6:59:09] sylvija_96: I really like that idea, I am one of the few who tends to use the notifications to go to streams, and that would be fantastic to cut down on the amount of them
[6:59:41] XshadowturkeyX: the channles i liek the most im usally in their discard and thats the main way i see when thy go live, i hardly get twitch notifications when i have them on
