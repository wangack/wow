[1:38:25] Cosmolus: people were bitching about the incentives but they are about to change their minds really quick
[1:38:30] Cosmolus: when that bag drops
[1:38:50] neverbornlucky: Panda said the new contracts within a year might kill a lot of non Asmongold streamer cause of their sub split and focus on dono over subs
[1:39:05] Isenheart91: I feel like right now is a good time to get back into WoW. Like jump into shadowlands with all content available then PrePatch :)

[1:42:33] danksly: meta dunkin another 100 bil in to ads to get another 30 users
[1:42:38] TheAverageGoob: I just got 8 from your channel last ad break

[1:42:45] railroad10989: @Towelliee  was one i seen that was 8mins and 200 hours of stream time
[1:42:56] kimmo_gaming: Thats like 1..5 minute add every 15 mins, thats crap
[1:42:57] Djfarmville: 8 is like tv standards of as as time
[1:42:58] DeanoTV: thank god theres a working adblock LUL
[1:43:04] druidhex: Sounds like old school TV commercials
[1:43:04] SpyCrabbo: seems like they are just slowly pushing it toward the ad ratio of tv
[1:43:05] Djfarmville: Ad time
[1:43:11] CritcobainTV: @DeanoTV link pls
[1:43:15] Orbrak: wait until they start to offer stream 8 mins of your 1hr add breaks LUL
[1:43:30] TheAverageGoob: I don't mind...especially since I am watching for free (without sub for now) it's a small way I can contribute to the stream
[1:43:33] SethBrowning: Some of the offers that were insane amounts required insane amounts of hours too. So that's a consideration
[1:45:21] Crisis88: Between that and Amouranth whole weekend news was ate up

[2:08:31] shiny_flaaffy: surely they can't delay it now right monkaS
[2:08:36] AureliusXV: Plus you really don't have a clue what goes into it, I have go live dates all they time and there are ao ays bugs
[2:08:38] Seathasky: I know Activision pulls the strings
[2:08:39] looney199725: its not ion
[2:08:43] looney199725: its bobby the goblin
[2:08:49] AureliusXV: Always
[2:08:50] MissSillyNilly: i have my eye on healing as the new class :p
[2:09:43] looney199725: worst thing they could have ever done is merg with activision
[2:09:58] NymannTV: please delay it :D
[2:09:59] ArcaneMaki: It's a little bit with Assassin's Creed and Ubisoft. The game devs have nothing to do with milking release schedule. It's the share holders that want the constant money.
[2:10:05] Kelticlore: was probably bobby wa ting it released early to get money before he leaves
[2:10:08] AureliusXV: I mean I could care less as I'm already playing it on beta lol
[2:10:13] falldrgn: I think the point of No return would be in a week or two.. or beginning of november.
[2:10:27] looney199725: bobby wants a boat before hes gone
[2:10:29] mongsns: thats why they dont confirm pre patch, because its not sure it gets ready
[2:10:52] AureliusXV: Ppl taking off work and shit lol
[2:11:07] digio9: delay for which reason?
[2:11:07] neverbornlucky: thats why I'm not worried about preorder right now enjoying wrath as well. Hunter got to 73
[2:11:13] looney199725: not really i think it would be good for the game and hopefully microsoft dont force them to rush development
[2:11:21] altair19992: it got delayed and was still BUGGY KEKW
[2:11:29] Kelticlore: they could would just be very bad buisness if they waited to the last week
[2:11:41] looney199725: activision is all to happy to rush content out
[2:11:43] zysmos: thing is like everyone expected this game to come out next year so wouldn't be surprised with a delay
[2:11:45] Zucchey: @looney199725 Microsoft has nothing to do with them yet on that level
[2:11:53] MissSillyNilly: im a gamer dad, and im allready at the point with my mage in WOTLK that i just park it in dala, and wait for the next raid, so im looking forward to DF :)
[2:11:58] looney199725: @Zucchey i know i said i hope when they take over they dont
[2:12:07] MissSillyNilly: by saying gamer dad, i have like 3-4 hours a day to play :p

[2:13:57] neverbornlucky: Towelliee the most fun of a expansion is not the delay or when DragonFlight launches, but on the day of launch watching you struggle to get into the game is the best Content of all. I remember shadowlands
[2:14:15] looney199725: the content so far has been rly smooth no one cares about tuning if you cant play your class

[2:15:16] SethBrowning: Area 52 on Shadowlands on launch was nearly unplayable the first few days. But that was an issue unique to A52

[2:16:24] luckfore: theyre testing 10.1 already towCopium
[2:16:30] looney199725: well they fixed beast master bug and broke something else sooo
[2:16:47] neverbornlucky: I think Blizzard is just praying on prepatch people do not fall through the area and that talents work right
[2:17:07] SethBrowning: Next week gonna be all hands on deck KEKW
[2:17:07] iseka11: @Towelliee with all your experience about the class, are ret pallys that bad for DF?
[2:17:08] Finiin: I've been out of the loop for the last couple of weeks, I think DF was doing good.  Is it not looking good now?
[2:17:09] liftedinxinfinity: same old routine with blizzard rushed
[2:17:18] Purgatan: pre patch going to be some open beta troubleshooting for them lol
[2:17:20] DovahChicken: Ye BM bug is busted doing like 1 mil dps
[2:17:22] SethBrowning: The sanitation works gonna be learning to code next week KEKW
[2:17:24] mrizzle12: That is probably why they announced end of season but not actual prepatch date
[2:17:25] Crisis88: Depending on how broken it is people wont mind too much in prepatch
[2:17:41] looney199725: that consecrate tier should have been for prot madge
[2:17:56] iseka11: Love to hear that, every single content creator that has access to beta are trashing pallys, specially ret :(
[2:17:57] dyslexican1: That is the part that is crazy to me. is pre-patch is about to come out. and so many specs don't work right. which means they haven't even actually been tested at all, because they just don't work . And it launches in a week. Thats NUTS to me.
[2:17:57] Kelticlore: i noticed the other day i got into beta
[2:17:58] xendros78: MrGM was talking about that last week, how it seems like the build quality is actually regressing as we get closer to launch
[2:18:02] Justintegra31: I really wish I could level up my last two alts but I just can't deal with SL anymore.
[2:18:16] Crisis88: Need time to lvl and gear my Evoker
[2:18:19] zysmos: @captain_stark99 Merci pour l'abonnement-cadeau !
[2:19:03] looney199725: they have stopped trying to fix tbh it seems like they would rather number tune not working classes

[2:20:28] looney199725: if they say its delayed cuz there not happy with state of game id be fine with that shows they still give a shit

[2:23:31] Justintegra31: what aura is that changing the enemy name plate'
[2:23:32] xendros78: blizz should just make feral druid top dps, great survivability, and raid utility, launch the expansion and watch the carnage
[2:23:36] poorhooligans: @neverbornlucky guess Blizz took you seriously :P
[2:23:38] Justintegra31: 's color based on agro?
[2:23:53] kimmo_gaming: by yelling a lot!
[2:24:30] Justintegra31: What aura is that changing the enemy's nameplate based on agro? (accidental enter key earlier)
[2:25:28] kimmo_gaming: Well its a hero class as they said, so you have to make an effort
[2:25:51] Kakotan2143: Well it is considered an advanced class though @Towelliee so it will take some skill to play

[2:28:26] Zucchey: You couldn't resist could you xD
[2:28:33] Donzie: @towelliee I was planning on mailing brewmaster this expansion but I feel guild leader wants me to play some other tank. Just to see if you think M+ and raiding they will be ok
[2:28:45] PigPenLen: Theyre fine so far
[2:28:47] Remmah_D: predictions o nthe most lucrative professions for DF? :)
[2:28:51] belfastcl: some servers probably have over 50k characters that could potentially log in
[2:29:26] PigPenLen: 2  new ones are pretty busy but not queue yet, for me at least
[2:29:26] KaisenSiru: Risen from the ashes
[2:29:26] neverbornlucky: Toweliiee what do you think of Undecember ?
[2:29:35] Donzie: @th3phantomlord cheers duder
[2:29:36] notdustinx: Project 60 now ?
[2:29:40] zysmos: that's what we like to see
[2:29:58] FrankTheTank1988: Brewmaster monk will always be 1 tank picked for raiding @Donzie just due to how stagger works. Unless you run into a very specific boss that has alot of magic dmg where stagger is less effective.  So seems kinda weird if your guildmaster wants you to play another tank :D
[2:30:32] FrankTheTank1988: Prot war and Brewmonk for raiding atm imo seems to be pick based on beta with VDH also relly good atm.
[2:30:43] looney199725: thats not how tanks are picked for raiding
[2:30:44] Donzie: @frankthetank1988 yeah maybe just cause usually play warrior or dk
[2:30:51] MOLAR305: I have a tank I need to lvl during time walking… I can tank for your dps
[2:30:54] looney199725: you pick the tanks based on if there dps and healer specs suck
[2:31:11] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee I recently tried to download and start back into new world and I felt lost on my character, not sure what i need to do to make myself want to play it, i just logged out PrideShrug
[2:31:33] dyslexican1: Ilove shockwave on my prot warrior.
[2:31:39] dyslexican1: Especally in M+
[2:31:53] Justintegra31: bro that stun would have cost me 5dps average.
[2:32:30] dyslexican1: I like it for the stun. Sucha nice Oh Shit button.
[2:32:39] Remmah_D: yea i just leveled a hunter 2 days ago. its QUICK

[2:34:18] FrankTheTank1988: @looney199725 the heck you on about there, thats not how you pick a tank class lol :D especialy for higher end raiding and M+. Not every player is a dps or healer some main just tanks. :) so then it comes down to picking survivability and raid /grp utility for your raid/5man grp.
[2:34:48] Lolmysterior: i finally got unbanned from the twitch stocks spam
[2:34:50] Lolmysterior: holy
[2:34:57] looney199725: frank i assume u dont rly play high end content because u deffo pick tanks based on how there other specs preforming if warrior dps sucks u need a warrior buff u bring prot
[2:34:58] Justintegra31: No matter how many times I go through this dungeon for the life of me I'll never figure out this maze.

[2:37:05] FrankTheTank1988: @looney199725 i play all 6 tanks in M+ my dude ;) i quit raiding in legion due to time investment, While yes in some cases you will bring X or y class based on Buffs. have you not seen Race to world firsts? BRM is almost always picked then whatever other tank is amazing usualy a Bdk cus of silly self healing.
[2:37:07] looney199725: yep its spicy haha
[2:37:07] Erielle04: Do you think there will be a pre-patch delay?
[2:37:14] Mojoejenkins: Guradien tuning this week???
[2:37:40] looney199725: @FrankTheTank1988 and i play all 6 in a hof guild so whats your point? im telling u the stand point of picking a tank for raid is diff to m+
[2:37:46] Justintegra31: yep. hard to delay something that hasn't been announced.
[2:37:53] KaisenSiru: ^

[2:39:10] Remmah_D: What about as an OT can they like kitty dps when they arent tanking?
[2:39:18] looney199725: @FrankTheTank1988 if you saying base toolkit wise brewmaster is good raid tank then yes i agree but you dont always pick them if you need other buffs
[2:39:46] zysmos: wow's gameplay just too good man
[2:39:50] Justintegra31: Could you imagine what our lives would be like if the servers just shut down for good one day?
[2:39:58] Remmah_D: i heard kitty bleeds gunna be boss as heck
[2:40:02] Justintegra31: just wake up one morning and BAM

[2:40:43] looney199725: xp in shambles
[2:40:49] FrankTheTank1988: @looney199725 oh im not disagreeing, but in many cases you have most buffs via dps or healers, where it then comes down to individual tank utility and their surviability. IF your lacking then you obviously make a comp change as the net buff of a class buff/debuff raising the raids dmg (for example BRM mystic touch.
[2:41:09] justagamingfiend: maze helper addon FTW
[2:41:11] KaisenSiru: anniesRage towRage

[2:41:20] Zettabyte: Don't be a leaver, @Towelliee KEKW
[2:41:40] looney199725: @FrankTheTank1988 and this is what i was explaining to you why brewmaster isnt always gonna be number 1 haha this was my point you bring the tank u need for buffs and utility if the dps/healer specs suck
[2:41:51] Steel_Saint_x: the leveling is the easy part in retail the power is a pain
[2:41:58] Paulyepsi: I still don’t understand how this is supposed to work

[2:44:05] FrankTheTank1988: @looney199725 Brm for progress is a very safe pick tho buffs/debuffs aside :D like for example you woud never pick a Guardian Druid over any of other 5 tanks in current Beta, due to terrible tunning and a talent tree thats garbage. ^^

[4:05:54] KatieGaming: hiiiiii good morning :)
[4:05:54] looney199725: it was only 7 adds u get more than that on a tv that your paying for
[4:05:54] Sollice: spicy is one way of putting it
[4:06:08] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee DO You have HBO Max? If you do my suggestion is to watch DC Showcase: Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam it is from 2010 and runs about an hour. It is a Cartoon movie. DC makes the best Cartoon movies. Some of the darker cartoon movies from DC are ones with Constantine. they are rated R
[4:06:13] Molvonos: My good deed of the year was giving Ellohime advice that brought his pet cat home.
[4:06:28] LearnedSomething: did you feel left out?
[4:06:31] Molvonos: Now I can be a massive shitlord til January.
[4:06:50] DallTV_: @Towelliee when you contract ends what will you do after ? =D
[4:06:50] Sollice: @Molvonos Do you know if Cohh found his cat?
[4:06:53] 3dRes: @Molvonos grrrHeh
[4:06:54] LearnedSomething: fair
[4:07:03] Molvonos: Not yet, Sol, but I gave him the same advice
[4:07:06] newkingcody: whats the lowest amount of money per month you would run 10 mins of ads per hour for
[4:07:07] Molvonos: And a lil extra
[4:07:13] neverbornlucky: would love to watch towellie and sloot with the others play phantasm
[4:07:44] nightknightjiujitsu: twitch just needs a skip button like tube. make things nicer for users
[4:07:47] Sollice: Aww man I hope he finds him
[4:07:52] Molvonos: Yea, I do too
[4:07:54] neverbornlucky: Panda the same when  it comes to contract. He plays the ad's but his contract prevents him from that button
[4:08:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: return ad free viewing to twitch prime members on every channel would help a bit imo

[4:10:54] nightknightjiujitsu: twitch been on autopilot for long time
[4:11:04] newkingcody: twitch favoritism

[4:11:30] duffluv22: New COD for Bruvs Night?? lol

[4:14:12] Strange_Inquiries: Tell them to sub if they don't want to see ads
[4:14:12] Donzie: or sub or buy twitch turbo :)
[4:14:12] Purgatan: I don't man, ads suck, but they don't piss me off, especially when I know what it means to the streamers.
[4:14:13] ObsidianHealer: Or just get like twitch turbo right? Then you never have to deal with ads if you arent subbed.
[4:14:21] Strayer_J: such simple advice yet such the correct answer
[4:14:26] mavericks312: 100 ppl vs 35k in ad money
[4:14:26] HonestPhilosophy: So glad I got turbo I forgot twitch had ads
[4:14:28] dimofodi: Would it really be so bad for a streamer and their chat to take 3 minutes 2x an hour to stretch their legs and go to the bathroom? If it's scheduled, it's easy to work around.
[4:14:32] Prevention6: you can't expect a streamer who's doing it as their source of income to not do it
[4:14:34] LiveFromStua: Oh no, ads on my free content...
[4:14:37] falldrgn: I saw this, just now. Behind each resume is a person with hopes and dreams and a family,  Same with streamers. Let them make their money.
[4:14:37] forthereals: but I want free stuff BabyRage
[4:14:45] wynter1: utterly amazing...tauren pun
[4:14:51] nightknightjiujitsu: im stubborn i wont sub or pay for anything
[4:15:00] LuiBMHunter: nope usually works for me
[4:15:04] neverbornlucky: Towelliee don't worry I'm lazy usually I only leave to watch anime or play the game while lurking. I don't change twitch even with commericals
[4:15:04] BlewGamingGroup: @Towelliee if you have 100+ lurkers threatening to leave. your probably sitting on enough subs to not care if a few part ways tbh
[4:15:14] looney199725: the adds are not even that bad isnt like your playing 7 10 min long adds they last like 20 seconds each

[4:15:23] raldrik: I have to reload ui when that happens
[4:15:38] NiteshadezTV: i mean you can lmao
[4:16:01] LuiBMHunter: you get a huge chunk just for killing this guy
[4:16:16] Wcvechten: I just hate it when ads pop during big moments
[4:16:25] LuiBMHunter: might get a renown when looting this one as well
[4:16:36] falldrgn: if adds play, just get up and walk around.

[4:16:40] LuiBMHunter: yep
[4:16:49] bypized: @Towelliee what is your take on people that are trying to become a streamer today. Do you think it is still possible?
[4:16:50] nightknightjiujitsu: @Wcvechten thats how theyre tryin to rope u in for ur $
[4:17:03] Prevention6: the only time I get frustrated with ads is when they are played during a hype moment in the stream that does suck sometimes
[4:17:05] 00birdhouse: I'm  to you with prime and have pushed turbo and still get a sidebar ad about once every 10 minutes
[4:17:12] NiteshadezTV: mfs act like its any different than tv or regular streaming services. why should this be any different?
[4:17:14] Wcvechten: Yeah, I know, but I'm cheap af lmao
[4:17:19] 00birdhouse: subbed
[4:17:23] nightknightjiujitsu: lol same
[4:17:38] TweektheProphet: honestly i think pre-roll adds hurt smaller streamers
[4:17:40] nightknightjiujitsu: i just go to youtube or back to rl if ads irritate me
[4:18:02] GamingDad77: @NiteshadezTV people just want a reason to complain. they would even complain about not having anyting to complain about
[4:18:14] RaegonGaming: That happens to me alot, I just leave when I get a pre roll when I look at new stremers
[4:18:17] nightknightjiujitsu: twitch is slackin there fosho
[4:18:34] Sylvannlee: how's everyone doing today?
[4:18:42] carbonoid12: cmdrlyrandar subscribed with Prime. 
[4:18:50] smashwow: it feels like twitch should have a system like youtube does that tracks the last time you saw an add
[4:18:52] carbonoid12: no ads for me
[4:19:05] 3dRes: Twitch now has a small video player in the right hand corner when ads are playing, but 9 times outta 10 it never appears LUL
[4:19:20] jerexify: 10 minutes an hour doesn't seem awful, given that it would normally be, what, 15 to 20 minutes an hour on TV?
[4:19:24] nightknightjiujitsu: i actually make it a point not to use the advertised things in life
[4:19:24] neverbornlucky: I forget which expansion it was but I found Towelliee on Twitch during one of the expansion when it was a huge launch so many people were streaming and I wanted to see what was going on got me back into wow
[4:19:25] LearnedSomething: idk, I mean they did cut down the rev share to incentivize the ads
[4:19:32] LearnedSomething: and that hurt the OGs the most
[4:19:36] Adfecto: I think they need to revolutionize how ads are played. They tried to fit a TV model to it but that doesn't really meld with live streaming.
[4:19:37] LearnedSomething: so maybe this is like a balancing thing
[4:19:39] jberry: @towelliee you want a carry in anything on that toon or you chilling?
[4:19:40] Bigbharash: twitch turbo for $10 gets you no ads for all of twitch
[4:19:41] Amarlian: They should steal the NFL idea for pre-roll ads. Do a side by side window, still have the streamer audio and run a silent type ad for people coming in @Towelliee
[4:19:44] smashwow: i like how the PiP thing is there and no sound. like look at what you can't see / hear Kappa
[4:19:45] RaegonGaming: Ublock Oirgin
[4:19:46] nightknightjiujitsu: if someone is advertisin theyre usually not hurtin for $
[4:19:54] MILESkg21: ttv adblock
[4:19:57] Armdel: ublock origin and adblock plus
[4:19:57] Zucchey: @Towelliee Popup Blocker is a godsend too
[4:19:59] toast0822: @Towelliee how are the tank specs feeling for you in dragonflight?
[4:20:02] duffluv22: Twitch is like cable when it first came out. When cable came out...it had zero commercials. Hell that was cables niche into why getting cable. Now look at cable. More commercials than regular tv. Showing my age...lol

[4:27:15] abracka_: you could get a firelands tw raid as well for some gear on this toon
[4:27:16] TheTimoBern: Cata just gross because the rp mechs are unknown to a lot of people lol

[4:27:26] killawatts75: When is TW?
[4:27:27] mavericks312: that timereaver doesnt exist

[4:27:41] Ertra: @mavericks312 ive had it since BFA
[4:27:43] Semmspiral: @KShellZx you hit 60 in the evoker starting zone so it wouldn't do you any good anyways
[4:27:43] QQisLIVE: So Timewalking is why we have 8 hour maintenance ?
[4:27:46] killawatts75: @mavericks312 I got mine on accident I didn’t know it even dropped

[4:28:11] Justintegra31: Ok, so the xp requirement change goes in with pre-patch and not release?
[4:28:12] abracka_: @QQisLIVE it's probably back end server things for pre-patch/DF
[4:28:12] QQisLIVE: I read they weren't changing the XP? I couldn't confirm that they are
[4:28:17] neverbornlucky: I remember when I used to watch hearthstone streams. Now all I watch is wow streams its odd how we stick to one community

[4:34:55] neverbornlucky: Towelliee what do you think about the Centors being on Dragon Isle. Nobble said the Lore of how they were created doesn't fit with the time line so he thinks blizzard should explain how they are there even if it means explaining how babies are made

[4:38:50] rbailey_2222: where the hell are all the tanks in beta lol
[4:38:50] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:38:53] StormiiG: @Towelliee The 2 trinket bonus in DF from pvp trinkets was 15% CC reduction and it didnt stack with Orc racial some ppl cried saying Orc racial will be useless so they reduced the set bonus to 10%
[4:39:00] StormiiG: Orc has been busted wayyyy too long
[4:39:05] Verdell263: To be fair, not once did I step into PvP during leveling for that bonus. Cancer, no thanks
[4:39:14] nightknightjiujitsu: yeah orc and human racials r op

[4:41:12] memnon94: I assume pvp gets pretty much zero focus as always
[4:41:18] nightknightjiujitsu: some kinda wpbp would b nice
[4:41:22] Jokervenom1978: ya i really miss the tower pvp from legion.
[4:41:24] AvrithSATX: I think the idea is less faction, and more "all vs all".
[4:41:24] Karn1987: im asking my doctor for a Continuous glucose monitor today so i dont have to poke my finger 12 times a day
[4:41:34] Snabido: Those FFA arenas too

[5:06:51] Walshey: when was the tech alpha? how recent
[5:06:54] looney199725: both aoc and star citizen show why kickstarters should prob be monitored more tbh
[5:07:04] Sollice: AoC is just playing the long game. Waiting until their IP is purchased

[5:07:56] looney199725: they have a issue of there plans are to big for what is possible
[5:07:57] im_capy: create kickstarter "game"...make tools instead....sell tools and scrape the IP
[5:08:01] HaxzorJimDuggan: didn't sell enough alpha access
[5:08:04] smashwow: which is ironic
[5:08:07] c0mmander_starscream: and probably bad dev management
[5:08:08] looney199725: they think they can make a 100vs100 pvp in those graphics there clowns
[5:08:08] PokerFaceMoose: Stephen is funding so he says

[5:15:03] looney199725: if you think it will preform well with 100vs100 players on it thats some copium
[5:15:05] Hupu_a: got 3090 and high end prosessor and was contemplating that need to upgrade for ashes
[5:15:08] itsbananas01: LUL Our computer will be able to handle that, but they'll render only 50 players
[5:15:23] Walshey: @Towelliee did you at least like the look of their combat update?
[5:15:23] Bernardo994: Going so high so fast with the processing power of the game will lock a lot of ppl out
[5:15:41] duffluv22: Thats why WoW with UE will never work

[5:16:09] looney199725: it reminds me of skyrim elder scrolls
[5:16:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: server capacity for ashes would have to be pretty low maybe even lower then new world to have that level of graphics
[5:16:25] itsbananas01: Also animations are definitely not great
[5:16:26] Theliahh: it looks fine but it doesnt really seem like it's doing anything unique

[5:17:58] Durithane: Do we know why the maintenance is so long tomorrow?
[5:17:59] ArcaneSyntax: the Mop heirloom weapons are worth because they have 2 sockets
[5:18:01] looney199725: @abracka_ your gonna need live insurance to play AOC cuz your gonna be sat infront of a bomb when you start that game up

[5:20:51] iamWaritself: That kind of stuff matters mostly for mythic, yeah? For norm/heroic, any tank would work right?

[5:25:31] itsbananas01: LUL Right

[5:27:00] duffluv22: Its the same with talents.
[5:27:15] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee Today is my birthday
[5:27:21] qoyote: I always found doing well on less op classes to feel more rewarding.
[5:27:22] Virus2508: df prepatch prediction?
[5:27:22] MILESkg21: play whatever you want AS LONG AS ITS THE META towRage
[5:27:30] Priatus: Pre patch is tomorrow? Will have 8 hr maintenance
[5:27:34] 91Niki: You know, the fucked up thing about a comment like that, that not only does the person playing it hear that, but so does all their viewers who is now gonna go " Oh, we're not inviting that class/spec cuz they said they suck"
[5:27:35] fewyn: fewyn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[5:27:41] Snabido: Such a hard prediction Keepo
[5:27:43] Virus2508: Pog
[5:27:51] smashwow: i will say the talent system for the classes i'm playing seem fairly balanced inside of the spec tree
[5:27:53] richardmu: no invitation in any PVE/PVP will definitely make the class/spec not fun
[5:27:55] blade_killa: @91Niki omg so dam true
[5:27:57] justagamingfiend: i think pre-patch happens on a Tuesday this year
[5:28:00] Longiboi: pretty much invest 20h of ur free time to realize you are not getting into groups because you play wrong spec
[5:28:01] SourceDna: I just want a slight buff to my bear boy
[5:28:14] MILESkg21: we all know that Feral is the red headed spec KEKW
[5:28:22] LunarbladeDK: Honestly i mostly play my mage and another character, that i find fun or is a healer/tank
[5:28:23] jeroome___: evoker community stigma is already real based on streamers
[5:28:31] KingSpud91: it also affects pug groups where theyll instantly decline you if youre not a "good" class
[5:28:32] Dyasis: same as MDI, can't play any class in m+ if they aren't played in the MDI
[5:28:33] falldrgn: I like Naows respond to tank tiers.. Just a random generated wheel spin
[5:28:37] Virus2508: man, every expansion i look forward for Naowh tank tier list KEKW
[5:28:38] metrohotness: I got to 2.3k io in affliction pigging lol screw the Meta have fun.
[5:28:40] Recording_on_the_grass: bears are the cutest!
[5:28:54] 91Niki: The amount of times I have been in groups and they go "Omg I didn't know feral could do dps like this, I always heard this are shit". That originates from someone with a follow creating stigma
[5:28:57] smashwow: you hear him chat. play warrior Kappa
[5:28:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: people are already gatekeeping certain specs on wotlk heroics LUL
[5:29:07] Walshey: "BUT YOU PLAY BEAR IF YOU LIKE IT"
[5:29:10] winraider: Echo is gearing up a bear for raid
[5:29:14] blade_killa: @91Niki exactly !
[5:29:25] Recording_on_the_grass: play the fluffys
[5:29:30] looney199725: @winraider noawh is gearing for world first 70 if thats who your on about
[5:29:44] KingSpud91: these tier lists that come out weeks before an expansion launch, where tuning hasnt even started, definitely has an affect on some people where they take that as gospel and belive that tier set is going to stick
[5:29:59] smashwow: @winraider is there a tank they aren't gearing for raid?
[5:30:20] Contendedlemon: do you have the frostwyrm proto drake from leveling a classic death knight? @Towelliee
[5:30:26] duffluv22: Nextvto last boss
[5:30:28] 91Niki: Not to mention, no matter how "bad" a spec is, put it in the right hands and the spec will PUMP. It might not pump enough for world first raiding. But they will do great
[5:30:35] DVaderCY: Mate you need more light in your face is too dark....like the dark lord
[5:30:41] ArcaneSyntax: and shaman most of the time, so movement stuff is gonna be everywhere
[5:30:46] silversoidier: Does it make you sad to not play prot Paladin during prog?
[5:30:51] 91Niki: @dvadercy Maybe he is the dark lord
[5:30:56] Thoreya: melee specs are so good in m+ rn for beta
[5:31:07] Mahal_11532: Mahal_11532 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[5:31:11] d_elven_lord: @Towelliee I agree, people get too hung up on what Streamers\influencers are doing saying. If you want to min/max you  are free to. But you don't have to play that way at all.
[5:31:20] smashwow: melee in DF in M+ with thundering oooof
[5:31:22] SonofHorus82: @91niki Towelliee is Voldemort confirmed.
[5:31:47] Fedratsailor: new version is better but melee can't stack at all.
[5:31:49] memnon94: Feral ? what's that ?
[5:31:55] Jango_: Lmao
[5:31:57] smashwow: @MindOfRob the problem with feral is it doesn't bring something special to the competitive melee slot.
[5:32:06] saltman112: no utility feral Sadge
[5:32:07] Jango_: I was stoked about feral until I saw the set bonus's
[5:32:08] MILESkg21: wasnt bear deleted in the last patch KEKW
[5:32:13] smashwow: it doesn't bring WTF or a Debuff etc
[5:32:22] Strange_Inquiries: That's a solid fuck no LUL
[5:32:27] Contendedlemon: as soon as feral gets some traction it gets nerfed to the ground, just like how their 4 P was super strong in mythic+ but it got gutted
[5:32:28] mavericks312: so apparently Sony has a silent hill showcase this week
[5:32:31] 91Niki: Bro, just watch Psybear, that dude PUMPS in m+ on his feral. Even in Shadowlands and BFA
[5:32:40] IceLoFi: what spec do u recommend for new players?
[5:32:46] HonestPhilosophy: Going from wotlk feral back to retail hurts
[5:32:50] Bernardo994: i wanna try feral so bad because its like a double rouge
[5:32:54] eldercandle: pt 2
[5:32:55] mavericks312: that could be huge for sony
[5:32:56] smashwow: feral is strong but you're "locked into" certain classes for raid. so that's a hard no
[5:33:01] MILESkg21: leaks say its probably Silen Hill 2 remake
[5:33:14] mavericks312: oh were getting a remastered series and a new game
[5:33:30] Molvonos: Who needs to watch Silent Hill when you live near the town it was based off..... towCry
[5:33:31] mavericks312: would be my prediction
[5:33:31] justagamingfiend: silent hill rumble
[5:33:44] MILESkg21: Molvonos BibleThump
[5:33:52] 91Niki: Well the reason why boomy gets picked over feral in world first, is because boomy is ranged. Most fights benefit ranged over melee. So even if the feral can do 5-10k more than a boomy, the boomy is still better for mechanics
[5:34:08] looney199725: the real question is has sean bean ever survived anything hes stared in?
[5:34:15] Molvonos: Freaking Centralia PA and it's forever burning coalmine.
[5:34:17] smashwow: @91Niki that + melee slots are just hard locked into the buffs
[5:34:20] Strange_Inquiries: @Molvonos What town is that if I may ask?
[5:34:21] ArcaneSyntax: new england in the fall is basically silent hill simulator
[5:34:24] 91Niki: @smashwow Yeah
[5:34:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: @looney199725 he didn't manage to die in The Martian
[5:34:51] smashwow: all the utility you get from druids are in the class tree mostly
[5:34:54] 91Niki: Yeah feral also doesn't bring a unique buff to the raid compared to other melee
[5:34:55] bonkyouded: bommies bring also things that a feral doesnt, such as amazing aoe
[5:34:59] smashwow: so resto or boomy
[5:35:44] Molvonos: @Strange_Inquiries Centralia, PA.  Back in the day, they decided to light a fire in the coalmine and it hasn't stopped burning.  Smoke pours up from the ground and the people living there are riddled with cancer if they decided to stick it out instead of moving away.  And since it's in the forests and mountains, with thick fog n' stuff, it gets spooky real fast.
[5:35:50] Contendedlemon: maybe phased
[5:35:53] looney199725: i still remember the reaction in got when they killed him off everyone was like shit they just killing main chars like that
[5:35:54] Dragonkiller1974: what are your thoughts on evoker?

[5:48:57] altair19992: making it so alliance and horde can be in the same guild; now that is ANCIENT code LUL
[5:49:53] 91Niki: Rami explained it really well on Dropped Frames. You can literally implement a random asset, lets say a random new critter in Org, and suddenly all of Org lags out and DCs people. The ripple effect in coding. It doesn't have to make sense.

[6:25:34] dym_jt: @Towelliee you should be able to skip that part from Oribos, takes you directly to Korthia
[6:25:36] Laudrana: It unlocks with the Korthia skip
[6:25:37] LuiBMHunter: need to unlock torghast first
[6:25:41] Tac2cul2: use your special maw mount
[6:25:41] Draugrs: if you can't mount on one toon in account you should have it on all

[6:25:50] ursinealli: no
[6:25:51] dym_jt: No
[6:25:52] mavericks312: no lol
[6:25:52] Laudrana: No, it's different

[6:25:55] Plague_GG: summon him chat
[6:25:55] Zerohz1: its 2 different for some reason
[6:25:55] SerFloyd: you have to do the korthia skip separately in oribos

[6:26:09] Rottencoarse: no they're different
[6:26:12] dym_jt: Talk to Bolvar in Oribos
[6:26:19] lalelusa: oh, I did the Torghast intro. perhaps that's why I could use it
[6:26:23] Tequima: @dym_jt Ah, they changed that - thank goodness! Still need to do part of the chain e.g. to unlock Torghat/portals
[6:26:24] Aidler: @towelliee skip it at Bolvar
[6:26:26] Fugazi811: towBolvar
[6:26:37] bankier9999: use the maw mount
[6:26:46] house573: maw is pinnacle garbage content
[6:26:55] ursinealli: You can do the Bolvar skip after doing the set up stuff in your covenant
[6:27:01] Draugrs: Agree should be on one NPC for skips
[6:27:04] garmin1987: try the shadehound mount
[6:27:04] Justintegra31: You died.
[6:27:09] GamingDad77: Have an NPC named "skipper"
[6:27:12] Theliahh: it's comical how much shit they make you do every time you hit 60 on an alt
[6:27:14] MikeyGy: the skip vendor KEKW
[6:27:21] moofia1980: yeh imagine coming back to SL after a break with all the skips and changes
[6:27:25] srze94: they are torturing 99% of the people bcs of 1% that wants to do that content again :D
[6:27:37] lalelusa: "we really want the player to immerse" so, no, there'll never be just one guy

[6:28:05] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee you can use your torghast maw mount still
[6:28:08] Einzbern: I thought that was account wide? Doing the quest made it safe for alts
[6:28:09] dym_jt: @Tequima I did another alt just a few days ago, didn't need to do any quests for Torghast.
[6:28:18] captiv8: All you have to do is the skip in oribos and ur good
[6:28:24] Stonkeep: just do the skip lol, or you are toast
[6:28:30] Lostdogal: hearth back and do the skip, this is not worth it lol

[6:29:18] Aidler: @towelliee i’d recommend to skip first
[6:29:20] demiralos: @Towelliee If you cant mount in the Maw, use the Corridor Creeper. If you ever did Twisting Corridors level 8.
[6:29:20] Snabido: Modern solution
[6:29:21] Rottencoarse: great content lmao
[6:29:24] SLoPPYALieN: LUL... very LEEEEEEERROY JENKINS of you

[6:32:53] Gingerprimer: It counted since you got the gold
[6:32:55] Mecabeast: it's like s3 normal raid ilvl

[6:33:15] PanoramicPanda: tal inara has the skip
[6:33:19] Shurn_82: is that diablo 2
[6:33:20] Theliahh: imagine a new player navigating this with no prior knowledge or friends for help
[6:33:21] ProfessorChaoos: 252 is a lot lower then i thought considering our mains are like 300 ilvl , but better than 226 greens i guess
[6:33:30] Durithane: no, do covenant ceremony then skip
[6:33:37] bankier9999: you need to do the covenent stuff first
[6:33:41] Laudrana: You need to do the first few covenant quests. There is a skip there quite soon. THEN Bolvar will let you skip.
[6:33:42] bob_the_demon: dont you have top be at a certain point in your covenant stopryline?
[6:33:43] Theliahh: same npc to start it tho
[6:33:44] Mecabeast: you might have picked the quest by accident might need to abandon it to get skip dialogue
[6:33:49] MILESkg21: the what

[6:34:06] reggiepowa: no I think

[6:34:09] Lostdogal: Pick a covenant and go to the opening quest, then it'll work
[6:34:10] srze94: oh I forgot about that
[6:34:12] Jaqhuir: just the intro
[6:34:13] bob_the_demon: Yeah the first 4 chapters i think
[6:34:14] SerFloyd: no it isn't. i just did the skip on an alt

[6:34:26] twitchmartin89: The first 2 quest or so
[6:34:28] bob_the_demon: the original 9.0 quests
[6:34:30] mayonaes: @ProfessorChaoos It is not bad considering DF quest start at 226 ish gear rewards
[6:34:30] Bashar_Strygar: getting cov abilities and conduits
[6:34:30] MysteriousMind: First soulbind
[6:34:31] desokin: where you bow etc.
[6:34:32] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  get your conduits then try talking to bolvar again
[6:34:32] Laudrana: You need to do like 5 quests in covenant before you can skip there.
[6:34:32] mrizzle12: Soulbind stuff
[6:34:34] luckyfooo: including flying to the convenants
[6:34:34] kissesaurus: Korthia unlock is till shapter 3

[6:34:45] Jaqhuir: Jaqhuir subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[6:34:49] Lostdogal: basically until you get a Soulbind I think

[6:35:22] GamingDad77: Doesn't he have to finish the Aiding venthyr and night fae?
[6:35:23] whatitdo1738: u open the soulbinds then it takes u back to orb then it lets u skip to korthia
[6:35:26] Lostdogal: no ignore all that
[6:35:32] Laudrana: You dont need to do the world quest, you can skip before that.
[6:35:56] Gingerprimer: @GamingDad77 nope
[6:36:08] Nico_vdM: you can use the 60 renown item at 50 dont have to wait till 60
[6:36:13] Lostdogal: its been a while and it shouldn't be as confusing as this lol. But I think once you're there it'll make sense
[6:36:21] reggiepowa: weekend is always dead with news
[6:36:29] Gingerprimer: They remoed so trash in HOV kind of nice
[6:36:34] im_capy: I wonder how many page refreshes wowhead gets leading up to a new expansion
