[0:50:02] Molvonos: Dunno about his monitor, but I'd be wary of asking streamers their hardware/software specs, since they tend to have specialized (i.e. expensive) gear.
[0:50:23] Molvonos: I wanted a good mic, for example, not willing to drop $800+ on one tho

[1:09:19] Gnomeknuckle: shadowlands has -1 content though
[1:09:20] KrakonSkullz: Torghast made me quit the game
[1:09:38] DeanoTV: SL does have content people just dont want to do the stuff that makes it an MMO
[1:09:56] gimmlay: the monsters and creatures look like unfinished models
[1:10:00] DeanoTV: like they complain about grinds LUL
[1:10:14] lumaday: I thought the BfA comparison was pretty on point. So many aesthetics in one expac.
[1:10:20] Lilurrn: Didn't they claim they wanted to push content faster but they've done the opposite lol
[1:10:23] Wise_Batman: is this classic or modern wow?
[1:10:23] FleuryGG: for me it feels disconnected because i grew up with wow being dragons and other epic stuff, this "broker" shenanigans doesn't feel special
[1:10:50] Demanisraar: At least no more Chorghast yeah
[1:10:56] maccaruso: Doesn't help that the aesthetic is "death" and depressing as hell in a lot of places
[1:11:05] azzurrin: People don't like Ion that's why
[1:11:09] kowaikoro: LUL
[1:11:09] luckfore: they locked him into his office and forced to work on 9.2
[1:11:09] DegenerateHaven: LUL
[1:11:15] flebbooo: KEKW
[1:11:15] bloodgulch_survivor: The most interesting and iconic tier sets were 2 and 3. Not sure if that was because WoW was fun then or they were just so unique. Probably both
[1:11:21] manmower: this xpac was the weakest story they've had in years
[1:11:22] notguiilty: dating way back to Warcraft...like WTF
[1:11:27] Rudric_Ice: Bullshit

[1:11:36] Frank4LuLz: prequal
[1:11:41] notguiilty: like they had it planned from Warcraft

[1:11:54] Breakers__: Is it confirmed there will be a WOW 2?
[1:12:01] luckfore: double leggos is broken lol
[1:12:01] azzurrin: dating back to when FFXIV announced EndWalker or this past summer when FFXIV was taking their player base LMAO
[1:12:07] odizs_: odizs_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:12:09] Gooseberries: From t he makers of Star Wars Eternity 's End!
[1:12:10] Rudric_Ice: I don't even consider BFA and SL CANON LUL
[1:12:13] Lilurrn: Why did they do like 10 interviews in 10 different languages
[1:12:14] Djugs_: "the negative was what we saw" LUL
[1:12:31] smashwow: it's looking at the same shit, with meh content, with disconnected systems, lack of community understanding. add all that up and that's why we feel the way we do.
[1:12:32] gimmlay: I agree man. I have always played wow since vanilla.. the last 2 patches have been the most underwhelming
[1:12:35] manmower: they must have a lot more that they just aren't ready to show yet
[1:12:48] Alepouditsa: @Towelliee you were playing the beta/ptr to befor even shadown lands lanche so i belive you burn on it
[1:12:54] Ertra: whoa,    a WoW stream... not what i was expecting to walk into this morning
[1:12:54] drisadel: didn't they say it was act 3 of this story, not a trilogy from Warcraft 3
[1:13:02] After43ver: wonder when next BlizzCon will be
[1:13:06] notguiilty: yeah zone and raid and most importantly the end of Sl. However them trying to trick us into thinking that their horrible writing and story was actually planned from Warcraft was a massive insult to the average player common sense
[1:13:10] xReasonZ: I think the video was overall was bad but the content itself might be good, we will have to wait for the PTR
[1:13:12] Aro725: im glad im not the only one just sick of sl design and brokers and shit. get me out
[1:13:23] Squirrel_nutty: mr world wide
[1:13:29] belfastcl: I wonder if they are working in something really different, either a new mmorpg or a revamp or wow
[1:13:33] magemaster225: the next expansion announcement is going to have to do work
[1:13:35] Wise_Batman: what happend to asmondgold?
[1:13:40] manmower: are the brokers worse than the bfa turtles though?
[1:13:42] mavericks312: i also feel that video was shot a while back for example the 2 leggo announcement after the 9.2 video
[1:13:47] kuiper_ow: @Towelliee wellcome back to korthia rift farming :)
[1:13:57] Kinghorn: google Amazin_Blvzn
[1:14:01] TheUnknowing: im sure the content will be fine, its aesthetic more than anything
[1:14:05] notguiilty: Like i never complained about any expan even BFA and WoD however this story is utter BS and them trying to trick us into thinking that it was planned from the start of WOW is just BS
[1:14:06] Alepouditsa: but we had the bigested's wait for 9.1
[1:14:08] pushnoir: I think a lot of the issues comes from community negativity ngl. BFA was just as bad if not worse than SL but didnt have this kind of public lash out, it was mostly Asmongold and Bellular back then.
[1:14:10] Thoreya: how do people know lol
[1:14:11] Thoreya: like what
[1:14:19] smashwow: i mean the dude didn't stop playing in WoD. that's saying something
[1:14:20] luckfore: surely its bigger no?
[1:14:23] KaisenSiru: The new zone looks astonishing triHYPERS
[1:14:31] Thoreya: they said its a huge ass zone
[1:14:42] manmower: they should have never messed with Sylvanas story and made her evil
[1:14:44] Ironcladd: I think it's horrible that 1 of the 2 equippable Legos have to be covenant.. yeey for cov switching ppl
[1:14:45] stratiss: It'll be time gated and alt unfriendly until 9.2.5
[1:14:56] iblighters: If the cypher hass no player power to it then idc if it's time gated
[1:14:57] Raaeni: @stratiss then dont play
[1:14:58] temp3st98: probably smaller than korthia
[1:15:00] DegenerateHaven: i miss timeless isle
[1:15:02] temp3st98: LUL
[1:15:02] Lilurrn: I'm hoping they allow flying in the new zone
[1:15:05] Thoreya: yeah both asmon and bellular said they like the cypher stuff too
[1:15:07] Thoreya: it sounds interesting
[1:15:08] Zenfar_: It feels like the devs don't want to make warcraft anymore. How can we be coming to an end of 20 years of story in a place that looks/feels nothing like warcraft LUL
[1:15:10] stratiss: @Raaeni i dont plan on it
[1:15:17] akia03: than yu get why no flying there crowd
[1:15:19] Shuttlelol: with 9.2 being the end, leads me wondering when they'll announce the next epack, dont htink they can wait til november
[1:15:19] Broomba: @lilurrn they wont
[1:15:22] Furinax: What do you think 10.0 is going to be?
[1:15:23] Erohw666: good game, lul
[1:15:37] Aro725: @Shuttlelol TRUE
[1:15:42] Rudric_Ice: Warcraft 3 ended the lich King stuff with Wrath and the Burning legion stuff in legion that's how I feel the Warcraft 3 story ended not this SL RETCON STUFF
[1:15:45] manmower: collectibles that fill in the all the story gaps from the last 15 years
[1:15:52] Wcvechten: aslong as it's account bound, I'm okay

[1:16:01] kowaikoro: the adventure sounds cool but knowing blizzard it'll be an timegated hell LUL
[1:16:06] Shuttlelol: hell ya, the language system could be sick if done correctly
[1:16:24] bloodgulch_survivor: you got some no mans sky in my wow bro
[1:16:24] notguiilty: XD Feedback hahahaha
[1:16:28] manmower: hopefully the new language becomes a permanent feature we can use in trade chat
[1:16:55] TheItalianStallion321: Tropic Thunder. i love that movie lol
[1:16:57] norshyp: WoW felt like too much of a job to me so I started FF. but I'm still optimistic the game will get better. i imagine it's hard to make a good game in the work environment they were in
[1:17:19] kowaikoro: leveling gear sets POGGERS
[1:17:26] DegenerateHaven: that was tragic
[1:17:27] Shuttlelol: the paladin gear looks ROUGH
[1:17:28] manmower: we could travel Azeroth and find places with old texts in the maker language
[1:17:30] iblighters: They don't look like class sets
[1:17:32] Sollice: DH set looked AWFUL
[1:17:36] Taz_85: Happy to be getting tier sets again even if they're ugly as shit
[1:17:40] UnholyLP: it only fits healpriests and paladins
[1:17:41] DeanoTV: shammy and hunter set looked good
[1:17:46] Demanisraar: Don't care how they look.. as long as the set bonusses are fun/good

[1:17:50] temp3st98: they still use the still concept for 3 years
[1:17:51] billybaroo1: rogues should look like black ninjas
[1:17:53] Eviltuna13: I did my first 5 star  run last night on my Holy priest. was fun
[1:18:02] flebbooo: mythic sets will make up for it COPIUM
[1:18:02] TheUnknowing: they are like half assed tier sets, congratulations every one is kyrian now
[1:18:08] lumaday: probably normal mode skins
[1:18:09] Sollice: SL
[1:18:12] belfastcl: at some point tiers started being about classes, but within a general theme
[1:18:17] Jeanssi: eternal traveler set
[1:18:18] Shuttlelol: maybe art team is hard at work on the next expansion and quickly threw together the sets
[1:18:19] KaisenSiru: People had way too high expectations for tier sets. They're still designing the sets around the aesthetics of the raid.
[1:18:21] ziri_ctr: it looks like ToC T9 sets, all the same
[1:18:21] Manabucho: it was preorder
[1:18:25] Gooseberries: Looked like th stuff from Argus to me
[1:18:26] notguiilty: the coillection set is 100 times better looking
[1:18:35] Rudric_Ice: the concept art looked cool tho but in-game DansGame
[1:18:38] Rottencoarse: it was pre-order  bonus for SL @Towelliee
[1:18:39] notguiilty: the sets look like leveling gear
[1:18:41] majorizc: pre OMEGALUL RDER
[1:18:41] Aro725: im so sick of oribos and the design. bring me back to dragons and shit
[1:18:52] notguiilty: like i feel like i already have it in my collection
[1:19:05] Shuttlelol: @Aro725 dont like the airport city? :D
[1:19:13] UnholyLP: to me it looks more light army of the light sets
[1:19:24] Rudric_Ice: the only set I like is the rogue one out of all of them
[1:19:27] Rottencoarse: oh btw have u seen sloot's tweet about u @Towelliee ? :D
[1:19:27] UnholyLP: like*
[1:19:51] Aro725: @Shuttlelol hate it lol. just the like square and robot design kills me
[1:19:55] TheItalianStallion321: i may be in the minority but...im just glad to have tier sets back....i personally dont care what they look like at this point
[1:19:55] DjDoesArtStuff: I wish so badly wow would just go FTP with microtransactions. I would come back so fast
[1:20:16] LordKain73: @DjDoesArtStuff Nope
[1:20:25] belfastcl: there is no general overarching theme there
[1:20:38] TheItalianStallion321: but i dont disagree what you're saying Towel
[1:20:38] Kauko13: There are no visionaries at Blizz at the moment ...
[1:20:40] Kromede: tier=animal in german Kappa
[1:20:40] billybaroo1: priest tier 6 Kreygasm
[1:20:45] Shuttlelol: the tier sets used to hype me up for the raids tbh
[1:20:48] manmower: old tier sets had different color schemes, that's the only difference
[1:20:52] Zoot_ABXY: I have the druid tier 5 shoulders. love those things
[1:20:53] mindrazor: Tier 5 Warlock was best ever
[1:20:57] cudlsac: thats why everyone just transmogs their gear now
[1:20:57] solsaver12: yup you could look at a character and know what class they were
[1:20:58] Griffo525: It’s not hard, that’s the frustrating bit
[1:21:03] RoxLOLZ: Yes they should have definetly gone for Class theme > Shared theme
[1:21:04] Taz_85: Getting my first full tier set in Karazhan Kreygasm
[1:21:07] Shuttlelol: ulduar paladin Kreygasm
[1:21:09] Taz_85: Good times
[1:21:12] Wcvechten: I need my spikes and skulls as a DK
[1:21:16] luckfore: think it was easier and faster for them to make them look similar
[1:21:21] DjDoesArtStuff: collecting every tier set from wrath and udner, best memeories
[1:21:32] Rudric_Ice: they wanted to go with the RAID astetic rather than the class fantasy
[1:21:40] MickyFresc: i think it's good to draw back to the theme of the raid specifically, but not to the extent we have in 9.2
[1:21:47] ShowDUH: I'm just happy it's a step toward it if the 10.0 set gonna be bonkers i'll be real happy
[1:21:49] Endogenous_: @Rudi_Ice Good way to put it.
[1:21:51] Narmus_: How long wuld it take for me to start earning enough gold not to spend real money?
[1:21:54] vatoloco2355: yes @luckfore correct they save money not coding them the different colors
[1:22:00] idenkaz_: KEKW
[1:22:04] Taz_85: But you can tell which of the new tier sets is for death knights cuz of the abstract skull mask!
[1:22:06] Kromede: all the same
[1:22:11] Demanisraar: it's all so bland
[1:22:13] Felrane: druid is the only one
[1:22:14] Nehcrom: They look like crap.
[1:22:14] mindrazor: Garbage
[1:22:16] TheGrey08: yep, too similar
[1:22:20] luckfore: warrior one looks cool
[1:22:21] iforceftw: priest set looks just like the lvling set
[1:22:22] Wcvechten: I just hope different difficulties have better colourations
[1:22:26] Gluwc: I think it's also partially because they now have 4 different color versions of the same gear. So they kind of have to homogenize down the base colors.
[1:22:27] xhaven: I like them FeelsBadMan
[1:22:30] Taz_85: I like the rogue one, actually, even if it doesn't look like it's for rogues
[1:22:31] MickyFresc: yea there's like 3 or 4 that are somewhat distinct but that's about it
[1:22:31] Fugazi811: yea those sets look awful
[1:22:31] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  this is a remake of the  crafting gear tbh
[1:22:32] billybaroo1: no green hunter gear lul
[1:22:32] Wcvechten: I think those tiers would good in black/red
[1:22:36] Taz_85: That faceless mask is neat
[1:22:38] Frank4LuLz: mop
[1:22:43] idenkaz_: last amazing set was BoD mythic set for Plate
[1:22:43] Elijahx88: @xhaven same
[1:22:43] flebbooo: legion

[1:22:45] Tedestrial: It's an alien world. I don't think we're supposed to find things very familiar.
[1:22:46] luckfore: antorus sets were very good yes
[1:22:48] Gutroan: Warfront set was kick ass though
[1:22:50] TakeThatBack: I havent cared for the sets since BC, I used Tmorph for a reallllly long time lol
[1:22:52] ShowDUH: so last time we had actual tier set  huh ...
[1:22:55] fistofnature: the Dazalador raid had amazing sets
[1:22:58] ShowDUH: let them get back in the game :P
[1:23:02] lucynsol: I would love if they did more reskins
[1:23:05] Holy_Z: the new sets are sooo ugly man
[1:23:13] KaisenSiru: I do agree. It's cool to want to make sets around the raid aesthetics, but it is restrictive, evidently
[1:23:15] ncsu_riggs: Been out of town a while.  Give up on NW?
[1:23:18] Holy_Z: looks like leveling quest sets
[1:23:35] shaneoshana: i miss this game so much
[1:23:39] Kauko13: oribos looked like cr*p and now the whole raid will look the same...
[1:23:41] fearxj: it reminds me of the combatant set in bfa
[1:23:41] Aro725: thats exactly how i feel, couldnt have said it better
[1:23:43] Tru1485: Tru1485 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[1:24:04] Rudric_Ice: I miss WoW lol didn't play for like 6 months
[1:24:23] MickyFresc: limit max said it should basically be no different for 99% of guilds
[1:24:32] Thecustomdude: I miss wow, but I don't miss the chores...
[1:24:38] xReasonZ: I hope the bonus effects from tier sets are neat
[1:24:45] KaisenSiru: I really do like the raid unlock schedule actually. 8/8 is like an Eternal Palace raid, then you get 3 more bosses after
[1:24:53] Gutroan: Miss wow too but im afraid that if I sub Ill get bored within a day again
[1:24:59] Holy_Z: they wont have to run multiple of the same class to see which one gets the best drops the first week
[1:25:00] Wcvechten: G'huun's loot KEKW
[1:25:02] theDirtyon3: Yeah
[1:25:18] theDirtyon3: I wonder what they are gonna do for the 2 and 4 sets gonna be interesting
[1:25:19] Felrane: @Gutroan thats what happened to me ha. Didn't play for 4 months and 2 days later im like why did i resub
[1:25:24] Ortinoth: the only good thing i like about 9.2 is the T sets coming back
[1:25:26] theDirtyon3: cause some classes gonna be broke
[1:25:34] neugassh: set 2 is +5% dmg set 4 is + 10% dmg
[1:25:52] Wcvechten: Too bad some of the covenant legos are really bad
[1:25:56] Holy_Z: i made so much gold from legendaries, now they are gonna double them :)
[1:25:56] Gutroan: @Felrane Haha yea but what else to play. There aren't any mmo's I want to put my time in
[1:26:02] large_kahuna: what is SoM?
[1:26:02] kuiper_ow: just got back to wow,what covenant for ret pala?
[1:26:13] Bayne77: meaningful choices
[1:26:15] warrenny: @kuiper_ow Kyrian
[1:26:18] z01z: its time gated bs like trial in wrath
[1:26:19] theDirtyon3: dont scare mne like that
[1:26:33] Felrane: @Gutroan I played some final fantasy and starwars while i was away. Nothing really hooked me though
[1:26:36] iseenoobpeoplee: @large_kahuna the new version of classic wow
[1:26:38] magemaster225: you think they keep them off the journal/testing becuase one is gonna be arthas
[1:26:43] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  https://twitter.com/Slootbag/status/1459496030144241678
[1:26:43] kuiper_ow: @warrenny ty ty
[1:26:44] Rottencoarse: :D
[1:26:57] Shuttlelol: what realm are you going for SOM?
[1:27:00] theDirtyon3: maybe its a sign of old philosophies coming back?
[1:27:01] large_kahuna: @iseenoobpeoplee oh really? are they actually going thru with some calssic+ changes?
[1:27:03] KaisenSiru: ICC yeah, and that was like 4 bosses for 2-3 weeks before the next ones unlocked
[1:27:06] Broomba: what renown level are you @towelliee?
[1:27:12] iblighters: My only problem is some the covenant leggo is so bad for some specs
[1:27:23] Gutroan: @Felrane Yea same, nothing is as polished as wow. Too bad the systems just suck in wow.
[1:27:29] parmesanchi: Arthas gonna save anduin tbh
[1:27:35] Sielu11628: I think Nathanos and Mal'ganis will be the bosses after Anduin before Jailer
[1:27:35] warrenny: That was kinda surprising they’d go back to that type of timegate
[1:27:36] Felrane: I was hopeing for 3 Lich King encounter. Bolvar/Arthas/Anduin
[1:27:39] theDirtyon3: thats would be dope
[1:27:44] idenkaz_: let that man rest ffs KEKW
[1:27:44] luckfore: anduin my son ill save ya
[1:27:52] ImRayFinkle: No, we help Arthas Madge
[1:27:59] Rudric_Ice: don't think so it will be arthas
[1:28:02] Taz_85: Having to fight prototypes of the Pantheon of Death sounds interesting
[1:28:04] neugassh: why would we help uther? he is a bitch
[1:28:06] warrenny: @felrane Anduins more a death knight
[1:28:10] Wise_Batman: i just read asmond on gogole that crazy bro wtfff
[1:28:20] Holy_Z: OMEGALUL
[1:28:25] akia03: they would have shown arthas to get more hype back for wow
[1:28:26] Bacon_21: don't know that I agree with the leggo thing, and I realize it's not Legion but that is just stupid to lock in covenant leggo imo.
[1:28:38] Rudric_Ice: maybe arthas helps anduine get rid of the domination magic or shit
[1:28:40] sarahpalinforpresident: Finaly @Towelliee is completely back playing WOW no more other shitty MMO :D
[1:28:45] Frank4LuLz: El copper
[1:28:47] mavericks312: i actually dont think we fight mal ganis but rather the dreadlord being denathrius
[1:28:50] Holy_Z: last patch and people dont know who he is or what his motivations are
[1:28:52] Toradin: Zu Lul
[1:28:55] Holy_Z: good story telling
[1:28:57] Sneaky2x: Zoval 'The Jailer' Gangsta
[1:28:57] theDirtyon3: ohhh buddy KEKW
[1:28:58] Frank4LuLz: chopper
[1:28:59] Bayne77: Birth Certificate name is Chester

[1:29:01] izdouble: KEKW
[1:29:02] Zedekul: PepeLaugh
[1:29:03] Broomba: @sarahpalinforpresident shitty mmos? WTF???
[1:29:05] jerseyfive: nipple guy
[1:29:07] pushnoir: Final Fantasy is a cheap copy of WoW, lets be honest
[1:29:12] mindrazor: LOL

[1:36:19] Demanisraar: adamant vault rewards are ass
[1:36:30] fistofnature: click close
[1:36:31] viopoppinoff: Only thought I have of the reason they are being lazy with a lot of the designs and zones is because they may be planning something bigger. Like a wow2 perhaps. Even though it could be 4-5 years out if not longer.
[1:36:34] Demanisraar: 20 tower knowledge, conduit item and sometimes a mog
[1:36:49] z01z: yea, conduit upgrades can drop, thats about the only good thing
[1:36:58] Demanisraar: conduit item does not always drop.. at least it didn't for me
[1:37:03] z01z: but, easier than farming korthia :p
[1:37:07] Holy_Z: conduits
[1:37:09] Holy_Z: 252
[1:37:09] gold9871: can drop toy and socket item

[1:51:55] iblighters: "new"
[1:51:58] Ambersulfr: I think they’re going to fix the last re-vamp with a new one
[1:51:59] thetruegodofwarr: maybe new old gods trying to corrupt it?
[1:52:01] luckfore: hoping for a legion 2.0
[1:52:05] idenkaz_: you know Azeroth waking up wont be a thing probably ever.
[1:52:07] GameingAspect: what if jailer consumes the soul of azaroth?
[1:52:10] PToastman: new old gods KEKW
[1:52:11] Squirrel_nutty: rip the arthas cord already!
[1:52:12] flebbooo: Baine will be stading straight in 10.0 COPIUM
[1:52:13] KeidooTV: back on wow dam welcome back
[1:52:15] d1stract10n: does the world soudl awakening destroy out planet?
[1:52:21] Daniel21Daniel: Good morning Towelliee, From Daniel & Melissa!!!!
[1:52:21] StraightErro: I think his boss room will be that room with the rune pillars dropping down from the ceiling, so there will be pillar humping involved
[1:52:24] giggz91: @Towelliee illidan comes back home
[1:52:26] flebbooo: standing*
[1:52:34] xReasonZ: I mean 10.0 is a nice number for a world reshape
[1:52:46] cyberratt: he's just trying to score some lsd
[1:52:59] j_bar111: @Towelliee i think the platform with anduin looks very similar to Lich king fight, i think we see arthas during or after that fight
[1:53:07] CCG_337: honestly,  reshape reality means, housing and and RP, an more jail or tits
[1:53:09] SilkeySmooth: id liek to see 10.0 be the retail version of vanilla wow and we get to re level through vanilla.
[1:53:11] xxxwaxyxxx: just wait 15 sec at the graveyard
[1:53:24] Ambersulfr: But then rebirth would never happen
[1:53:27] Sephirothxz: Thinking about arthas i dont know if i want to see him back… his story arc is so perfect that i fear it can be ruined so easily not because of blizzard but because it was so epic that nothing can compare.
[1:53:27] d1stract10n: still need to buy it

[1:53:30] Stangin2122: Tuesday starts the 17th Anniversary
[1:53:35] fistofnature: some of it is free, but most costs stygia or anima
[1:53:44] alamonav: @Towelliee thats teh weekly dungeon quests
[1:53:46] Lincoln_WoW: its the dungeon weekly that are below the inn
[1:53:51] theDirtyon3: I usually have like 1500 phantasma at the end of my runs so i buy the mog with that
[1:53:57] hbsause: it upgrades the world quests to give more
[1:53:59] Lincoln_WoW: yes
[1:54:01] alamonav: yeah
[1:54:02] feherlofia123: nzoth killed us and we are all dead
[1:54:04] CCG_337: and my only question is where the fuck is arthas in the maw?
[1:54:04] Rudric_Ice: we don't even know if jailer is bad guy or a good guy look at thanos he was the hero of his own story
[1:54:04] Hank_Chinaski: Hey Towelliee does it feel good to be back to WOW?
[1:54:10] Lincoln_WoW: no lol
[1:54:10] Leo320: Enema rewards. Kreygasm
[1:54:20] j_bar111: @Towelliee i think the platform with anduin looks very similar to Lich king fight, i think we see arthas during or after that fight
[1:54:26] madspeed312: jailer is basically thanos LUL
[1:54:28] DDFeeder: @towelliee reshape flip. sends pantheon To shadowlands To free himself from binds of maw. pantheon now trapped in maw. sargeras helps build portsl so we get back To azeroth where is world rewamp 2.0
[1:54:36] Antriludez: !SoM
[1:54:40] Sephirothxz: @towelliee when do you think new xpac announcement will happen?
[1:54:44] Ambersulfr: It would be nice if they had ever hinted about what the jailer even wants
[1:54:45] billybaroo1: thats a lot of renoun
[1:54:48] Aro725: Copium on that lol. It would be nice but i feel like they wont do that
[1:55:12] Malarick: and the sword is the portal
[1:55:12] hbsause: can you not buy the thing with the korthea currency yet for your alts to get renown?
[1:55:20] manmower: he could make horde and alliance buddies with his power
[1:55:31] alamonav: UPDATED barrens please
[1:55:33] Holy_Z: @Ambevsulfr you would think thats a big part of the story eh?
[1:55:33] Kromede: Lalafels towPog
[1:55:36] CCG_337: feels like blizz needs a new writer team, because this is so boring, just my opinion
[1:55:38] Delacrois: @madspeed312 so the jailer did nothing wrong?
[1:55:42] Wcvechten: or everything is moved 2 inches to the left
[1:55:50] GameingAspect: orcs control sw
[1:55:50] Ambersulfr: @holy_z exactly!!!
[1:55:56] d1stract10n: Gammon for warchief
[1:55:59] bearlicioussss: So cata 2.0
[1:56:02] Kromede: OMG we will be Raccoons like in Elyon
[1:56:03] Holy_Z: They dont even ever explain what remaking reality means
[1:56:07] warrenny: Or garrosh
[1:56:08] azzurrin: Thta's how they'll explain the faction being able to PvE/PvP with each other
[1:56:12] Holy_Z: its just like o... ok
[1:56:17] Silverwards: Orgrimmar is all white and city like, and Stormwind is made of steel and bones and earth
[1:56:18] DJBD83: mankrik needs his reparations! they did my guy dirty by killing his wife!
[1:56:19] hbsause: its going to be a holy expac next with the way they have been setting it up
[1:56:20] JamesRyanXF: towelliee back to warcraft
[1:56:22] Demanisraar: like broken in half
[1:56:27] Ambersulfr: If mankriks wife is alive we never go on a crusade against the quilboar
[1:56:30] Ambersulfr: That would be weird
[1:56:32] idenkaz_: I actually believe that N`Zoth at one point tells us the truth about what he did in BFA. N'Zoth is Azeroths last defence it's not how it seems.
[1:56:37] abracka_: turalyon/yrel's version of the light is basically on par with the scarlet crusade. there's no LK to control the undead either. plus, they mentioned time moves differently on azeroth while we're in the shadowlands. who knows what it'll look like when we return
[1:56:45] fistofnature: nooo PepeHands
[1:56:46] manmower: you think you'll like that color scheme for an entire xpac?
[1:56:55] Wcvechten: Zovaalia
[1:57:00] Kromede: Earth
[1:57:02] billybaroo1: deathwing destruction 2 lul
[1:57:05] Alt_slash: I wish Lost ark was out right now
[1:57:05] Brodih_: like Cataclysm x 100 ? @Towelliee
[1:57:14] Stangin2122: The ULTIMATE sundering

[1:57:26] theDirtyon3: ragnorok Pog
[1:57:26] Rudric_Ice: gallywix's pleasure palace
[1:57:29] Sephirothxz: The Jailer is good and will save us cant stand because if it was like that he simply could have said this to us. Instead his intentions is to remake reality according to what he likes and wants.
[1:57:34] d1stract10n: 2?
[1:57:36] flebbooo: Imagine the whole planet under light control
[1:57:40] manmower: time travel and we play through revamped version of every xpac over time, but changed
[1:57:41] DJBD83: on the titan
[1:57:43] snowman_gaming365: Deathwing?

[1:58:29] DJBD83: so like the turtle from Pandaria then?

[1:58:44] funKShun: Diablo Immortal
[1:58:50] Sielu11628: I hope we can swim again in this new reality, instead of walking on it
[1:58:56] ShowDUH: Nah your toon wake up in the Skyrim cart !
[1:58:57] theDirtyon3: it has to be i think
[1:58:58] Holy_Z: no shot
[1:59:02] flebbooo: we can walk on her boobs? PogChamp
[1:59:04] stratiss: He knows

[1:59:07] Nokterian: you will wake up in Skyrim @Towelliee
[1:59:09] theDirtyon3: HE KNOWS
[1:59:11] KatieGaming: whats SoM. Just read the title lol
[1:59:12] idenkaz_: you actually think they would spend 100M on a new engine?
[1:59:14] Arocian: 20 year new engine
[1:59:15] xReasonZ: Huge Hopium
[1:59:17] funKShun: New World killer Pog
[1:59:27] BananaCatchUp: No Changes Kappa
[1:59:35] Ambersulfr: That would make sense, 10.0 breaks the world and 11.0 re-does the graphics
[1:59:37] drewetling: HUGE!!
[1:59:38] wazon_7: unless they already started working on wow with new engine theres no way its happening in 11.0. Rebuilding the game on new engine is years, even decade of work
[1:59:49] Pricanballer34: Reshape reality by another time lock that you have to grind 400 days
[1:59:50] StraightErro: WoW Reborn
[1:59:58] Holy_Z: with the way OW 2 is working out I doubt they wanna make WOW 2 KEKW
[1:59:58] MrDToTheIzzle: Dont tease me
[2:00:06] o__mj__o: 15 years and their engine still laggy and cant handle stress ... new engine u say :D
[2:00:07] Mcaffee: didn't they say 9.2 would be the end of book 1, that leads me to belive that 10.0 is book 2 with the new engine
[2:00:10] funKShun: Ow2 is more like OW 1.1
[2:00:29] Malarick: come on man.  Some of us Boomers just learned what Copium is.  Now you drop Hopium?
[2:00:29] boozandbutter: damn i can't believe your back to wow been a min
[2:00:33] Ambersulfr: It’s too late for them to do a new engine for 10.0
[2:00:39] PToastman: it's taking it's time tho
[2:00:41] Molvonos: Story was good, aside from Sylvanas.
[2:00:42] Ambersulfr: Last time they did it it took what, 2 years?
[2:00:43] Nokterian: im tired of sylvannas
[2:00:48] Sicknessqt: i just think its too crazy and out of nowhere.
[2:00:58] oradros: they never explain why the jailer is bad
[2:01:01] Holy_Z: ^
[2:01:07] nokster: yes but every episode is 9 months apart
[2:01:09] Holy_Z: so many plot holes
[2:01:10] PToastman: why did they open the sky to azeroth anyway
[2:01:12] Aro725: lmfao
[2:01:12] d1stract10n: DK path fo frost
[2:01:12] abracka_: it's water that's not water
[2:01:13] Volkien: semen
[2:01:16] abracka_: simple
[2:01:16] idenkaz_: first ones bath water Kappa
[2:01:20] Gluwc: LUL
[2:01:21] luckfore: you can actually walk on this water hehe
[2:01:25] Masqerader: Water u can walk on? So ice?
[2:01:27] Hank_Chinaski: Hey Towelliee, thinking of getting back to WOW, is it any good being back playing wow?
[2:01:36] KingSlayerYotam: That's a good point, it does feels we've been dragging the same story the last 3 expacs
[2:01:38] alamonav: its aquafina, sponsering zovaal
[2:01:39] Ambersulfr: It’s just physical surface but looking like water
[2:01:49] Ambersulfr: Probably prototyping a new concept
[2:01:51] flebbooo: yeah its fine, i just wish we had more cutscenes/cinematics. Feels like we had way more of that in bfa
[2:01:53] Deathchampt: could be very salty watter
[2:01:55] Pricanballer34: It’s just land with a water copy paste filter
[2:01:57] wazon_7: the devs seem to now know their own story. They said that shadowlands will conclude the story that happened in WC3.. what? Story of WC3 ended in Legion when we "beated" Sargeras, the big bad from WC3. Jailer has nothing to do with WC3 afaik
[2:02:19] Eran_21: problem of people with the lore is that the potential of the stories are not fully exposed like jailors story could have so much more cutscenes to understand the charachter
[2:02:24] Vexxsis: this diablo 5?
[2:02:40] Ambersulfr: I want to play a murloc or a furbolg
[2:02:54] Tru1485: @wazon_7 they made it so that the jailer was behind the lich king
[2:03:13] warrenny: @wazon_7 Dreadlords sylv lich king
[2:03:16] Sephirothxz: @towelliee if u think about it what was the point of breaking the veil between azeroth and the shadowlands? The jailer didnt need azeroth to invade other covenants… so looking at 9.2 hints of the story where he went completely on a different realm azeroth veil opening wasnt needed at all
[2:03:19] Ambersulfr: Right but no one knows wtf he wants
[2:03:25] wazon_7: they just made it up in this expansion @warrenny
[2:03:31] Aro725: I think its just been so long between 9.0 and 9.1 that i forgot literally why the Jailor is even bad @Towelliee
[2:03:36] wazon_7: it has nothing to do with wc3 sotry
[2:03:40] azzurrin: would be cool if they did it like FFXIV
[2:03:43] Vexxsis: Scuff Thanos
[2:03:44] Alienfromger: i want 20+ minutes cutscenes SwiftRage
[2:03:44] Molvonos: Chadcred being an emo little fuck
[2:03:45] Sarocus: Thank fuck for that
[2:03:48] Ambersulfr: No one knows what there world even looked like when he was imprisoned.
[2:03:50] Pricanballer34: I think I’m more excited about Diablo 4 that anything wow. It’s just played out. Repetitive grind to keep you paying $15 a month because you can’t complete or progress with the game effectively due to progression gates
[2:03:51] Spathotan: The game has failed to give me a reason to stop Zovall. Why is he bad?
[2:03:56] satchvai: too bad they don't do that, would make the game better
[2:04:04] Basic_BS: Because he drops loot
[2:04:06] Basic_BS: yeehaw
[2:04:13] warrenny: @wazon_7 Added more context to previous stuff is bad?
[2:04:19] MuttonChopins: I wish they didnt cancel Bellular's voice acting addon project for WoW
[2:04:26] Dr_Booom: After BfA, I was hoping for the same number of cgi cinematic. Was cool to have them last exp
[2:04:29] Molvonos: @Spathotan He wants to enslave everyone and make reality his bitch.  That much was made clear early on.
[2:04:30] manmower: if players want WoW to be revamped we can't really be against the Jailor who is trying to do that
[2:04:42] wazon_7: invalidating most of previous story line you mean? @warrenny
[2:04:54] Molvonos: If you're into being enslaved, more power to you.  Most people find that to be reason enough tho.
[2:05:04] Sephirothxz: Couldnt the jailer simply do what he did without opening the rift between azeroth and shadowlands?
[2:05:26] Pricanballer34: Ppl who pay $15 a month and complain about same game have no IQ
[2:05:29] RunningOutOfRAM: You are paly WOW Pog
[2:05:30] azzurrin: Problem with WoW story telling is that they piece meal it through years and a lot of the lore is in books that are outside the game,  I just want it when I'm playing I should not have to read multiple books to get the full story.
[2:05:32] BlinkHeals: @rektariz doesnt he want to rule everything?
[2:05:56] misiek_buchatek: the master of master of master of master of master plan xD
[2:06:05] Mallaes: While I like FF14 and it's story, it's so cutscene heavy that I feel like I'm overfed with nothing but cutscenes during my playthrough
[2:06:14] manmower: we escape with the soul of Azeroth and implant her into a brand new world where we start over
[2:06:29] Sephirothxz: @blinkheals yes but why he asked sylvanas to open the rift between azeroth and shadowlands before he aquired the covenants sigils and became more powerless and free?
[2:06:32] 無職提督: i mean she must be a hottie, everyone wnats her
[2:06:35] wazon_7: My guess is that azeroth soul is soul/sleepy first one that apparently created titans, void, light etc
[2:06:35] Sephirothxz: Powerfull*
[2:06:45] Cru3: Good morning chat / towelliee HeyGuys towHAMUP
[2:06:49] Masqerader: The theory is Azeroth could be the most powerful titan soul in the universe
[2:06:49] alamonav: zovaal is gonna reshape wow into a battle royal
[2:06:55] TheGrey08: Azeroth might be creation
[2:06:59] KatieGaming: I am ready for a new plot
[2:07:18] jaina8675309: the soul could be a first one
[2:07:41] o__mj__o: before the titans
[2:07:54] warrenny: 2 years

[2:08:10] wazon_7: azeroth is the first one that created order, void, light and everything else
[2:08:22] Pricanballer34: Even the Jailer is tired of WoW. He wants to revamp the trash

[2:08:33] hikaritd: Zovaal says "witness REALITY's end" and on the cosmic map it says "reality" in the middle (aka Azeroth)
[2:08:36] azzurrin: ANother problem with WOW story telling is that it isn't cohesive it's piece mealed together, unlike FFXIV story telling it's so much eeaier to follow, just play the game
[2:08:38] sifer007: the story is just bad go back to orc vs human blizz
[2:08:38] unstoppablelv: LUL LUL
[2:08:43] Tru1485: while he may have known something, he was doing his job for a while then got imprisoned
[2:08:49] Mcaffee: Maybe Azeroth is the one above all, reincarnation of the actual creator of the universe
[2:08:52] Holy_Z: never seen trees on floating rocks before Kappa
[2:08:56] warrenny: Rip getting vashjir 2.0
[2:09:03] Sephirothxz: The only think it can make sense is that the jailer needed a living mortal to aquire the covenants sigils for him. Otherwise it make no sense
[2:09:08] yuvalal: why ion or muffinus were not in the video ?

[2:09:32] smashwow: look at the floating rocks that haven't been done... bitch TBC had that
[2:09:50] Ambersulfr: That’s what i was thinking too @towelliee !!! Have you guys never been to Nagrand???
[2:09:51] twistedstick1: We have something new. It's called water.... oooohhhh
[2:10:01] smashwow: magical water
[2:10:04] Pricanballer34: They trying to appeal to the obsessed and low IQ that have no ide there are better games out there. Giving them hope that “there is more” but in reality it’s copy paste
[2:10:06] Kromede: devs that never seen nagrand

[2:10:58] Deathchampt: the first chicken is there
[2:11:07] Sephirothxz: I think 9.2 will be a good patch but the story needs to be so clear otherwise they will leave us with this sense of why are we even here in the first place like 9.1 did
[2:11:19] parmesanchi: @NinjaGlovz it's probably an extension you have in your browser
[2:11:25] Buttscratchrr: They tried their best.... To push people away to make it feel like it is the players fault is the reason that wow is dying

[2:11:38] Angerday: Idk man, the whole original Jailer and Sylvanas team up thing never made any sense. Her plan was to make more forsaken and make an army to claim stormwind, then all of a sudden it was “oh hey I work for Interstellar chain boy the whole time and part of that plan was to forget that plan and fool you with my first plan”. Seemed too shoehorned.

[2:46:42] richardmu: @Towelliee at flight point in Oribos. 1000 anima
[2:46:49] Kisswani: but yeah seems kinda useless to not have a shared pool of anima between covenants now
[2:47:10] theDirtyon3: Pog
[2:47:23] theDirtyon3: get a limit carry fa sho NODDERS
[2:47:28] Todmeister9000: want's flawless
[2:47:39] Rudric_Ice: so you can only earn renown by spamming choregast ?
[2:47:41] Jollywhompus: @Towelliee are you going to play the SoM classic or is it too much the same?
[2:47:42] Todmeister9000: you need flawless for renown
[2:47:43] Etrissa: after a certainpoint you gotta move to floor 9
[2:47:43] Soliddus: What renown level are you?
[2:47:51] Aidler: @towelliee already tried solo islands?
[2:48:19] Soliddus: You should also farm layer 9 for renown if you're doing lower @towelliee
[2:48:25] Mallaes: 🐮
[2:48:35] MisterBongwater: The swap is really good now. If you’re into the transmogs you can do grateful offering farm across all covenants one one character
[2:48:36] Rudric_Ice: not pally bro LUL
[2:48:51] Maego1: Classic Enhanced :D
[2:49:02] Rudric_Ice: oh NVM lul forgot cows couldn't be pallys
[2:49:04] Bayne77: butt muh world buffs
[2:49:07] abracka_: it's def classic+, they said no class buffs for this season. it'll be a continuous wipe/improvements+new stuff
[2:49:10] Kinghorn: warriors like world buffs
[2:49:22] maccaruso: I love using World Buffs.  I hate getting World Buffs
[2:49:33] solsaver12: SoM is more of a challenge now because players found Classic too easy
[2:49:45] Jollywhompus: I like the idea, I think they need to find a good medium between D3 seasons and classic no change
[2:49:49] oshtwitch_: still feel like the bosses are still too easy
[2:49:57] hodor1969: They should give paladins a taunt
[2:50:15] Astrolarx: I can't believe that there are people willing to play a 17 year old game yet again for like the 3rd time lol
[2:50:31] Aidler: fresh and + but not new luxthoKEK
[2:50:57] ArcaneSyntax: they could have made enhance good, but since they didn't SoM is dead to me.
[2:51:02] Wrizzik: "but mah 'mersion!"
[2:51:12] ttmaker: wish 10.0 is good <3
[2:51:19] Aeylid: teh debuff count change was a good call
[2:51:22] oshtwitch_: still looking forward to the raid where all the characters are hardcore and some hunter ninjapulls and they wipe
[2:51:23] diln: they shoulda made all classes viable in SoM
[2:51:27] FerociouzMonk: the Spawns in battlefield 2042 sucks.
[2:51:30] boootybuttcheeks: Wow is good Copium
[2:51:30] luckfore: 40
[2:51:39] Mecabeast: itd be nice if som had horde pallies and ally shamans
[2:51:40] Jollywhompus: Leveling changes is the only reason I am going to try it

[2:52:14] Rudric_Ice: did they only change molten core ??
[2:52:19] ArcaneSyntax: the classes are so boring
[2:52:26] Wrizzik: world dragons, too?
[2:52:42] Alt_slash: I feel like I have nothing to play right now lol
[2:52:47] Kapers_: Wish they had BC Talents in SoM

[2:54:12] valianya: Its only BC and onward where entire focus was shifted to mostly endgame content
[2:54:29] ArcaneSyntax: I don't think it'll be 4 months of PTR
[2:54:33] Kisswani: monkaS
[2:54:49] StoicTaurus: You stepped into a trap ... that hurts ;-)
[2:54:56] d2darkalliance: Ptr is up in 2-3 weeks, more likely 3.
[2:55:05] jaina8675309: WoW 17 Year Anniversary Celebration next week got to farm the new mount
[2:55:30] Wrizzik: @jaina867530 what's the mount this time?
[2:55:45] ArcaneSyntax: there was a lot more gameplay in that announcement than the 9.1 announcement.
[2:55:52] Velashen: They were hype on announcing the new.. water....
[2:56:00] jaina8675309: Illidari Doomhawk
[2:56:08] luckfore: ptr 1 week after som launch makes sense
[2:56:14] jaina8675309: its on wowhead
[2:56:21] N3llee: is there really any hype around SoM? Feel like its very little if any at all. Except from that Hardcore group
[2:56:23] BookofFiveRings: @towelliee back on WoW yes, an amazing sight.
[2:56:38] AFKSammich: AFKSammich subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 80 months! 80 years of Towelliee? Let's fucking go.
[2:56:41] Masqerader: Anniversary in a few days, get to kill Doomwalker
[2:56:59] Noksolis: Dont know how 9.2 will be. But I just want Zovaal to win. He promised me playable tauren rogues in his new world.
[2:57:19] BookofFiveRings: lol, i'm here for it. glad to see you playing.
[2:57:28] Kisswani: Kinda how I feel about aff lock
[2:57:43] Masqerader: Battlefield has tanks :P
[2:57:51] jackvalentin: Hello are you done with new world??
[2:57:55] SteveSD: you need to use skill
[2:58:02] SteveSD: and dodge and manage stamina
[2:58:07] ArcaneSyntax: FFXIV just has dps that hold aggro
[2:58:53] Djugs_: Ashes of Creation has an actual class called "tank"
[2:59:16] luckfore: lfr ilvl :D
[2:59:34] valianya: Imagine if they added lower level content beyond just leveling quests for during leveling that you can start gaining progress in regardless of level?  A lot like how the battle pet system scales independently of level and gear.  Its its own power scale of content you can do while leveling without having to rush to endgame to enjoy
[2:59:54] Buttscratchrr: should be about 3 weeks out and the PTR was nice!
[3:00:15] Masqerader: ya ur way behind lol
[3:00:54] iblighters: WoW tanks do damage as well
[3:01:02] Kinghorn: PogChamp

[3:01:55] Kinghorn: I thought it was all quests
[3:02:08] cryft: only hard quests that might actually get you killed
[3:02:21] BirdzFlyinHi: not to be annoying, but can u tell us where you are at with WoW? Are you just coming back? How long has it been?
[3:02:57] drskull452: yup
[3:03:11] StoicTaurus: More Dots !
[3:03:11] Kinghorn: time to rend!
[3:03:18] Hyasinthe: warlock rejoice
[3:03:26] Aidler: it’s called “season of mastery” and I guess they think no bonus for casuals so normal quests
[3:03:29] cryft: say goodbye to warlock curses they just gonna agony now
[3:03:44] snuffles_80: best thing they could ever do
[3:03:50] Carahail: lol
[3:03:52] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:03:52] mmrghost7: LOL
[3:03:55] MadCowScurge: lol
[3:03:55] drskull452: lol yea true but atleast have one CoE for shadow dmg
[3:04:00] Celebrinal: THE LINT
[3:04:03] Tharia: aww
[3:04:14] mmrghost7: GOD damn
[3:04:14] Tharia: mage boost was bae
[3:04:30] snuffles_80: if this was in classic from the start I would have enjoyed alot more
[3:05:21] SteveSD: HONOR SYSTEM LOL
[3:06:04] druidiful: only if you have never died before
[3:06:05] Kisswani: that's cool
[3:06:06] kokochris: seems so
[3:06:11] padrebones2011: as long as you've never died previously
[3:06:12] ArcaneSyntax: you can only get it if you haven't died so
[3:06:23] kokochris: as long as you haven't died previously
[3:06:25] Tharia: that's cool
[3:06:26] SteveSD: hardcore and you have to voluntarily delete your character
[3:06:36] SteveSD: what a ass backwards design lol
[3:07:28] SteveSD: the death penalty doesnt even stack
[3:07:28] Oblivionul: lol not @SteveSD
[3:07:38] thecynicalshuffler: just lets everyone know you failed..   umm.. ok...
[3:07:46] kokochris: should have just left your character in the dead state.  roam as a spirit
[3:07:52] ArcaneSyntax: it's hardcore but you can keep going if you want.
[3:07:52] kokochris: danK
[3:07:55] luckfore: big yikes if quest exp isnt buffed
[3:07:58] Aidler: hardcore is quin shit
[3:07:59] SteveSD: yeh they need to permantely delete yourcharacter if you die
[3:08:02] SteveSD: thats what hardcore is...

[3:08:36] Frozzenfire: Frozzenfire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 120 months! 
[3:08:52] SteveSD: lol our games embrace hardcore so we figured we would add a watered down version that defeats the purpose of originally releasing hardcore
[3:08:53] kokochris: lol
[3:08:56] cryft: you lose some prestige for undertaking a hardcore character if you can just make it softcore whenever you want
[3:08:57] disc0dojo: Meh kinda like POE then, i dont delete my HC char if he dies. If the league is on for a while i will restart.

[3:09:36] cryft: Commander_Eggi but now theres an in-game sanctioned way of doing hardcore, which is NOT what hardcore players want
[3:09:50] Watershots: 9 ads lol
[3:09:50] Butcherdude22: svend94 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:10:07] SteveSD: the entire dynamic wont of hardcor doesnt matter if you dont lost your character on death, literary what hardcore is lol
[3:10:17] cryft: it's like they're trying to nod to hardcore players, but instead it's just "look at me i havent died yet" which is different than risking it all
[3:10:21] kokochris: @watershots blame twitch danCopium
[3:10:46] valianya: Why didn't towelliee run ads while pooping but then runs 9 ads in the middle of content...?
[3:10:47] Molvonos: @SteveSD Like people have said, delete the character yourself.  The hill you're trying to die on is an ant hill, jesus.
[3:11:15] EKS90_: I agree with @Molvonos Like.. you can still do normal hardcore. just don't use the ingame system.
[3:11:16] SteveSD: @molv or just dont play, cause this is clearly a bait, hardcore players know what hardcore is supposed to be
[3:11:18] kokochris: @stevesd not really.  other hardcore systems downgrade your character into softcore mode or non hardcore leagues
[3:11:23] SteveSD: this is for...... im not sure

[3:11:57] solsaver12: gonna be fun watching this SoM raid content lol
[3:12:16] CritcobainTV: Fucking shit. so if u dont kill him an hour after pulling, u cant kill him

[3:12:24] brewss: i think 60 mins from first pull

[3:12:27] BRUTALIT0PS: BRUTALIT0PS subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[3:12:32] Rottencoarse: you have 60 mins to kill him
[3:12:36] CritcobainTV: 4-5 depending on if u get brez out
[3:12:46] CritcobainTV: @BRUTALIT0PS hey bby ;)
[3:12:48] SteveSD: @Molvonos  you are defending a gamemode designed to delete your character on death by saying you should have that choice. go back to identity politics
[3:12:50] BRUTALIT0PS: Howdy!
[3:12:55] pugnare_: onyxia deep breaths more
[3:12:56] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee ony spawns ads while shes in the air
[3:13:02] Kisswani: @Molvonos the silly thing is that if the goal is to reach 60 without dying on one character , deleting that character or removing the buff achieve the same goal . can't understand people sometimes
[3:13:02] CritcobainTV: the trash adds that aoe
[3:13:08] N3llee: she spawns dragonkin
[3:13:11] jkitchin75: more dots
[3:13:12] CentroGaming: 2 drake adds flying around at the start, summons the warder adds during flight phase and more deep breaths
[3:13:13] N3llee: and other dragons
[3:13:16] StoicTaurus: Deep Breaths more
[3:13:16] druidiful: she deep breaths more
[3:13:24] Silverwards: more whelps, handle it
[3:13:36] ChuckyTrees: @SteveSD just delete your toon 4 head , your making nothing into somthing built around a System built by players
[3:13:39] cryft: @Kisswani it's not the same though, because if you make a character with the intent to hardcore, you invest in hardcore. if you die, but dont lose your progress, then the risk isnt actually there in the first place
[3:13:48] SteveSD: wow just constantly trying to please everyone while pleasing no one. this is kinda business 101
[3:13:51] SteveSD: unfortunate
[3:13:55] cryft: thats why people enforcing hardcore leaderboards require video evidence of all gameplay
[3:14:01] valianya: FINALLY
[3:14:23] cryft: if you can cop out to softcore to save your investment, then there isnt really risk in that character
[3:14:27] Molvonos: @Kisswani Yep.  The end goal of SoM's hardcore mode is posterty, with cosmetic stuff as the reward.  I can't understand the whining.
[3:14:44] Molvonos: Steve's just a tryhard troll at this point tbh.
[3:14:46] KurumTV: Alt-left arrow
[3:15:07] CritcobainTV: who is steve
[3:15:23] CritcobainTV: Fuck you steve :)
[3:15:26] EKS90_: @cryft who cares?... a HC char can just show video proof of them not dying, and then just continue playing that char anyway, its the same damn thing.
[3:15:27] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:15:41] EKS90_: or them dying and showing a run over
[3:15:44] EKS90_: and then play that char anyway.
[3:15:47] kokochris: @molvonos some people can't get their head around other concepts.  once they form an opinion they will stick to it and can't comprehend change. danCute

[3:16:09] theDirtyon3: monkaS
[3:16:11] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  November 15th
[3:16:16] cryft: @cryft because that just shows that this "hardcore implementation" does nothing for hardcore players
[3:16:19] Kisswani: Doomwalker is the dude infront of BT right ?
[3:16:21] Tharia: meh that's manas
[3:16:25] CritcobainTV: Mike Dhawk
[3:16:30] SteveSD: oh a micro one that looks cool go figure
[3:16:57] cryft: @Commander_Eggi the whole appeal is the risk of loss, not just "oh i guess i didnt die all the way to 60, time to wave the hardcore flag"
[3:17:00] N3llee: okay thats cool
[3:17:18] EKS90_: you can still do that tho.. do that version, let other people do this version
[3:17:33] cryft: but "this version" reduces the prestige of true hardcore
[3:17:35] Kisswani: yes please , we need them
[3:17:36] ChuckyTrees: @cryft if you dont die getting to lvl 60 then guess what , hardcore achived
[3:17:39] Molvonos: Has the Cosmetic tag, so yea.
[3:17:45] EKS90_: I like hardcore, i dont mind deleting a char, but I can see the appeal of both for different people
[3:17:57] snuffles_80: this might be the first anniversary I miss in wow since relese
[3:17:57] cosmothug: i saw there was a glasses vendor but im not sure if those are xmoggable

[3:18:09] cryft: @ChuckyTrees but without risk of losing your character, it's not hardcore. that's like saying you climbed a rock wall without a harness while wearing a harness
[3:18:22] ArcaneSyntax: leveling is already ultra fast though
[3:18:28] cryft: you were safe the whole time, you just didnt need your net
[3:18:31] Kisswani: nah , only way to level now is to buy the boost Kappa
[3:18:38] ChuckyTrees: Nope , becuz if you dont die then you achived it reguardless of what way you want to think about it
[3:18:39] Aeylid: reported :P

[3:19:57] Tharia: agreed. cool shit is kind of the point
[3:19:57] EKS90_: @ChuckyTrees no we gonna have " did you do true hardcore or did you have a softcore char you tried HC on "
[3:19:58] Molvonos: @Kisswani Euuughhhh
[3:20:07] EKS90_: @ChuckyTrees which is the exact same thing.
[3:20:13] theDirtyon3: ......

[3:23:56] Molvonos: The Mage set looks like a fucking dong tho.
[3:24:00] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  are they learning for real tho?
[3:24:08] Tyraze: We love class sets, yet they were gone for 3 years and they look like shite
[3:24:22] Kisswani: @Towelliee btw I think there are different colors for tier sets so different colors might make them better

[3:26:37] y0rtek: meh, idk its pretty bad
[3:26:40] onybear: (Looks at my shaman main) huh crazy concept…
[3:26:44] DubakuMatumbo: @Towelliee Havent watched the presentation.. did they create a new *player engagement* system?
[3:26:50] luckfore: the concept art looked sick
[3:26:51] Rudric_Ice: only rogue  looks good other sucks
[3:26:52] Zerost0rm: looks like a priest
[3:26:54] sorrel_n: They look good, but they look like they belong to a different IP
[3:26:57] Kisswani: btw , I hope we can fly at some point in Zereth Mortis
[3:27:00] DeanoTV: sham and hunter set looks good
[3:27:05] N3llee: how the hell as an artist do you think those sets look good... cool..
[3:27:05] assman_ny: Yeah, my biggest issue has been the set looks
[3:27:07] ArcaneSyntax: druid literally has antlers
[3:27:08] KatieGaming: hunter on left
[3:27:09] twarnak: Pretty trash lookin sets imo
[3:27:10] lowlifepuppet1: They are pretty lame looking lol
[3:27:10] luckfore: lock
[3:27:14] JPS15: lock
[3:27:14] madmannyyz: tier sets look like shit
[3:27:14] valianya: Hunter
[3:27:17] ArcaneSyntax: shaman is a wolf
[3:27:18] blazyturtle: lol
[3:27:21] cappei: ''This set looks nothing like a DK set. How can we fix it? Oh, I know. A skull''
[3:27:22] Claritycraft: they look like glorified leveling gear
[3:27:24] ArcaneSyntax: hunter is hawk
[3:27:25] Thdlock: no thats warlock
[3:27:27] DeanoTV: sham and hunter are 1st on each
[3:27:27] KatieGaming: far left
[3:27:28] Broomba: where is waldo?
[3:27:30] ArcaneSyntax: it aint that hard.
[3:27:33] NuAera: honestly rogue ones the best
[3:27:35] Kisswani: warlock is middle right ?
[3:27:39] Buttscratchrr: They should of put names label them on their bare minimum efforts
[3:27:42] Necrosack: robes are for hunters.  everything is hunter loot
[3:27:45] Kisswani: Thd POGGERS
[3:27:47] D3m0nHunt3r666: demonhunter is best Kappa
[3:27:47] OGXanos: @Towelliee without telling us what you know where do you think the game is heading from 9.2 to 10.x
[3:27:49] xxxwaxyxxx: its like a designer was trying to give them a reason not to fire him  " bro this water is outta this world , never been done before "
[3:27:53] Rudric_Ice: love the rogue noface one looks like tyrael
[3:27:58] chopsaki: aint worth that sub money
[3:28:00] valianya: Hunter is bird helmet scale mail chest @towelliee
[3:28:05] killswiitch: So true man
[3:28:12] Exusprime: I left wow in Cata and they look like remodels of older tier sets
[3:28:24] twarnak: 9.0 armor that wasn't the oribos style was pretty good. Like the covenant stuff. But everything after that has been lackluster.
[3:28:34] y0rtek: old gods expansion inc?
[3:28:38] killswiitch: I'll resub when the next xpac comes out
[3:28:41] Milanesa_De_Pollo: it doesn't feel like wow
[3:28:42] Masqerader: looks like stormheim
[3:28:44] Cristoff90: Looks like one of the end zones from Wildstar
[3:28:44] KatieGaming: Well it is a "building block" kind of zone
[3:28:48] Masqerader: just colored differently
[3:28:50] spyderman62: lmao
[3:28:53] mandilozano: looks like gw2, the starting zone of the small people
[3:28:55] Kisswani: it's sort of a workship to be fair
[3:29:00] luckfore: theres 2 zones no?
[3:29:12] luckfore: 1 with sand and 1 with green shit
[3:29:13] Jysy: looks alot like destiny
[3:29:16] DubakuMatumbo: @Towelliee What is they *player engagement* system in that one? IonJam
[3:29:19] sorrel_n: Ya like everything about this looks cool, but it just doesn't look like it belongs in WoW
[3:29:20] duhworks: true
[3:29:21] valianya: The idea was to make it look like Oribos
[3:29:22] StoicTaurus: Well.. that's kinda a point ;-)
[3:29:32] twarnak: Voldun
[3:29:32] goofywizard: @Jysy Defintely looks like Destiny
[3:29:33] KurumTV: Voldun
[3:29:34] KatieGaming: This is where the First Ones created things, so I would expect the entire zone to hint everything in WoW
[3:29:34] Kisswani: Voldun
[3:29:35] EmilandLA: vuldun
[3:29:36] darksoreno: VULDUN
[3:29:39] EmilandLA: voldun*
[3:29:40] Rottencoarse: Voldun
[3:29:50] Rudric_Ice: nagrand too
[3:29:50] valianya: They built Oribos and Zerith
[3:30:04] cazhually: wonder what they're gonna do with the conduits and their ilvl
[3:30:08] duhworks: nope
[3:30:08] cazhually: since renown does really change
[3:30:09] KurumTV: Have you gone through the raid news yet?
[3:30:13] luckfore: yep jailer
[3:30:13] KatieGaming: Jailer
[3:30:14] OGXanos: Zereth Mordis is them using the OG emerald dream that got datamined way back in wrath and applying new textures to it
[3:30:14] Kisswani: yeah the Jailer
[3:30:16] temp3st98: yes
[3:30:17] duhworks: yeah
[3:30:17] goofywizard: I think introducing the "First Ones" is a big mistake to WoW
[3:30:19] Masqerader: it is the jailer
[3:30:21] KatieGaming: He has his full armor back
[3:30:26] Funderik: he was grey
[3:30:37] darksoreno: its jailer after get hom sigil
[3:30:37] killswiitch: lol
[3:30:37] Rudric_Ice: he looks goofy
[3:30:39] twarnak: The covenant zones actually kinda still felt like WoW but all the stuff in the maw,oribos and now this new zereth zone just don't feel like wow imo
[3:30:42] luckfore: looks like plate set :D
[3:30:50] ChuckyTrees: @Towelliee see the Azerite behind him kappa
[3:30:52] Masqerader: So we need to rescue Anduin, I assume Wrathion is gonna appear and tell us about some cap
[3:30:52] NanotronRofl: lol, is that azerite behind the jailer?
[3:30:52] theDirtyon3: guards
[3:30:53] cam__: massive strike
[3:30:55] madmannyyz: overwhelm?
[3:30:57] XVASTOLORDX: i want that mace
[3:30:57] sorrel_n: The mistake wasn't introducing the First Ones. The mistake was demystifying the Titans too much that they had to introduce something new to be mysterious
[3:31:00] Masqerader: *cape
[3:31:01] Rottencoarse: massive strike :D
[3:31:03] Kisswani: KEKW
[3:31:11] Julia: if he had a more demonic look and maybe no legs but a floating tunic he would look scarier i think
[3:31:12] Malicone: nice xmog
[3:31:27] killswiitch: yup
[3:31:29] lowlifepuppet1: I dont like how we save the universe from evil titians. With my bow and arrow lol
[3:31:33] hikaritd: If we defeat a Titan++ powerlevel creature the lore is over for me... so fkn dumb
[3:31:34] BRUTALIT0PS: I think the story was good, but everything around it was meh
[3:31:45] Rudric_Ice: shadowlands should have been 2 expansions
[3:31:59] valianya: The design idea was to make Zerith and Oribos feel 'alien' and foreign to most of WoW

[3:32:03] Funderik: @lowlifepuppet1 reroll then and use another weapon
[3:32:12] randOMG: This is Blizzard's best attempt to escape Shadowlands.... same as it started, shitty.
[3:32:23] duhworks: he looks like a more detail arthas
[3:32:28] Masqerader: The only thing I hate about SL, is how they did Ursoc...."anima drought" yet we farmed that shit everyday
[3:32:30] BookofFiveRings: i think in later expansions they'll bring back more first ones stuff. but i think they're going to re ground themselves and do Azeroth things and stories before going back to first ones lore
[3:32:38] OGXanos: what happened to all the Arthas teasing I wonder
[3:32:38] darksoreno: mount
[3:33:01] sonothesilent: no more new world?
[3:33:04] snuffles_80: looks cheap
[3:33:05] iuraotv: argus was better imo
[3:33:07] ChuckyTrees: The start of shadowlands was good , it had hope to be a great xpack , its what happened in 9.1 that really fucked things up
[3:33:18] luckfore: they did that with argus and nazjatar too
[3:33:22] N3llee: lets hope not
[3:33:24] Ruthemann: story just have huge jumps with it. we see anduin steal that rune/sigil thing and they steal it from night fae place and Im thinking to myself are these sigils/runes something we should care about and why arent they explained to us?
[3:33:38] Rudric_Ice: this guys are not the first ones tho its their robots
[3:33:40] Fragglevision: i havent seen any of my typically watched streamers stream retail, for months now
[3:33:44] duhworks: this sounds like 40k
[3:33:48] Toradin: i want to go back to Azeroth tbh
[3:33:48] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @beardedhusky (warning)
[3:33:51] zuna1904: i just hope 10.0 will be a different wow
[3:33:51] malddktank: these guys created sargeras then?
[3:33:52] Fragglevision: I havent even touched it in months
[3:33:55] Funderik: they said there's other places we havn't discovered and seen yet in their video.
[3:33:55] OGXanos: We won't meet any first ones. They made Zereth Mordis and left, just like the titans made shit and left
[3:33:58] kraugan: word
[3:33:59] valianya: They might be
[3:34:14] KatPiter: I guess they made themselves ..... that .... way?
[3:34:15] Kisswani: I think they said that they create the different afterlives
[3:34:16] Naturalbeef: Maybe this is the kickoff to the new storyline
[3:34:20] Aidler: and the the ones before the first ones enter the stage…
[3:34:23] jerseyfive: where the hell is wow going whats next NotLikeThis
[3:34:24] scud3333: But who created the creators?? Hmm???
[3:34:42] scud3333: Patch 9.3
[3:34:44] kraugan: We will return to a new realtiy as we wont be able to stop the jailer, so called: WoW 2 !
[3:34:55] Coragarm: I rather go back to being a simple adventurer again rather then being a hero to to some ungodly worlds
[3:34:56] valianya: There's lots of other planets in living world we can go to
[3:35:03] EKS90_: literally lit
[3:35:07] EKS90_: DAmnnit!
[3:35:10] EKS90_: LUL
[3:35:10] lowlifepuppet1: Do we get the Thanos Glove with the tier set?
[3:35:19] cazhually: do they continue updating the conduits even though renown is capped at 80
[3:35:35] valianya: Better have ranged glow weapons too
[3:35:36] malddktank: paladin's wet dream
[3:35:39] Rudric_Ice: broker armor looks better than tier sets
[3:35:41] Zerost0rm: these armor sets looks way cooler wtf
[3:35:42] Cristoff90: The broker armor sets are better than the tier sets lol
[3:35:50] Basic_BS: Theres a mechagnome wearing it in the video
[3:35:53] Spathotan: the broker sets are legit
[3:35:58] Ruthemann: agreed @Cristoff90
[3:35:59] OGXanos: I hope there's  a silver version of all this gold stuff. It just looks like Legion/Demon Hunter sets with Green jewels to me
[3:35:59] Basic_BS: hard to see because mechagnome but yea
[3:36:01] ensidios_: What bothers me is that it's literally World of Patchcraft where they create such a great and awesome zone and nobody'll give a sh*t about it in the next patch
[3:36:17] StraightErro: I'm not surprised they basically made this place just a patch instead of it's own thing, they did the same to Nyalotha, I wanted so much more out of there
[3:36:26] theDirtyon3: Sepulcher
[3:36:31] zuna1904: i realy wonder how complex anduin gonna be :D
[3:36:33] luckfore: look at that special water
[3:36:34] Toradin: no
[3:36:37] Rudric_Ice: yes

[3:36:44] Aeylid: flying in news zones? what do you think this is FF?
[3:36:44] duhworks: nope
[3:36:44] Rudric_Ice: the spiders were flying
[3:36:45] Basic_BS: yes
[3:36:47] OGXanos: they said flying spiders so probably
[3:36:49] Silverwards: in the new zone? yeah already confirmed
[3:36:50] rowbojenn: it's already confirmed
[3:36:50] mandilozano: they showed a flying spider

[3:36:55] kazobtw: its amm summed in mmo champ
[3:36:58] flebbooo: oh yeah the flying spider
[3:37:04] Donutstein: After you can fly in Maw and Korthia
[3:37:07] Donutstein: then maybein here
[3:37:09] Aidler: lol in WoW the first ones are basically the devs…
[3:37:09] Donutstein: KEKW
[3:37:15] lowlifepuppet1: yay
[3:37:21] mandilozano: maybe not at the beginning, need to unlock it
[3:37:22] cazhually: what about conduits
[3:37:24] Tamex26: Who thought flying spiders were a good idea :D
[3:37:24] brodycanuck: No torghast
[3:37:29] cazhually: like are those gonna be capped too
[3:37:32] valianya: @towelliee  I saw something mentioned where Zerith flying would be part of cypher system
[3:37:36] Aeylid: snail mount MVP of 9.2

[3:37:43] ItsTrevway: @Towelliee yo happy wishes on your holiday for you and your family
[3:37:45] thiccsushi: It wont be PepeLaugh
[3:37:46] goofywizard: nah save it for 10.0
[3:37:53] OGXanos: needs to be like Timeless Isle + Argus
[3:38:08] shadowgrove88: do u think 10.0 will be  even  by next yr
[3:38:10] mett7: its gonna be big COPIUM
[3:38:11] StraightErro: It could be physically huge, but empty of content, and you fly from small space to space to do quests
[3:38:14] blazyturtle: there better be rares that drop toys
[3:38:17] brodycanuck: I want another suramar zone
[3:38:25] Mecabeast: considering we migh not get 10.0 till late 2023
[3:38:28] flebbooo: Fruits? Kreygasm

[3:39:11] Mactub: EZ
[3:39:12] Merex760: When Blizzcon happens again, I hope someone cosplays as fruit
[3:39:12] snuffles_80: like the snail in neverending story?
[3:39:13] druidiful: it better not go faster than walking speed

[3:42:40] snuffles_80: have they fixed legion raid so that we can solo it?

[3:44:50] rowbojenn: @smashwow they've framed it such that defeating Anduin happens weeks earlier in the story than killing the Jailer. It also lets them hide the last bosses to make World First more interesting in theory
[3:45:00] blazyturtle: Gachi
[3:45:02] brodycanuck: Maybe tyrande stripped her of her gear
[3:45:02] Rudric_Ice: let tyrande capture syl and torture her

[3:55:54] Rowwek: where does the story even go if there is no story reset
[3:55:58] o__mj__o: finally
[3:55:59] Sarocus: He said the third and last act, didn't he? So still some ways to go
[3:56:00] Funderik: he said end of a chapter
[3:56:01] 2Pok: maybe WoW 2 ?
[3:56:02] Wrexsoul: M. Night Spoiler - Jailer wins, rewrites everything then rides off into the sunset with a blizzard flag attached.  Game ends and there is no more lore, no more expansions. This is it.
[3:56:03] syvelion: wow realm reborn
[3:56:04] seidengreif: next 40k years forward -> 10.0 = Starcraft MMO Kappa
[3:56:04] Crypticshock: Titans are hitting Algalon's reset button.
[3:56:10] thiccsushi: 10.0 full of retcons most likely
[3:56:12] blazyturtle: new solar system to explore Pog WoW becomes starcraft online Pog
[3:56:14] GivTater: are they saying that because it's true or because it's the same thing FF has already said about endwalker?
[3:56:16] sorrel_n: It makes sense. Blizzard as a company and the WoW team all want a fresh start with players.
[3:56:16] rowbojenn: he was talking about Arthas
[3:56:19] Nokterian: I thought Legion was the end
[3:56:24] theDirtyon3: the light
[3:56:26] Funderik: arthas since wc3
[3:56:27] N3llee: the end is the begining
[3:56:27] Reklawtam: dragon isles
[3:56:28] aRustyRanger: high levels of copium
[3:56:28] Templexx: its like the 3rd movie in every franchise. just not as good lmao
[3:56:29] cappei: @GivTater Oh, I'm sure you know why LUL
[3:56:30] Zenfar_: they get rid of warcraft and azeroth, the game will die over night.
[3:56:31] Shoeboots: Dragon Isles is next xpac guaranteed
[3:56:32] magemaster225: dragon isles
[3:56:34] Basic_BS: could be anything
[3:56:35] o__mj__o: time travel the easy fix always
[3:56:36] valianya: Return to Azeroth to find Turalyon Light Cult took over Alliance and Anduin is the prodigal lost heir returning to reclaim the throne from Usurper that isn't ready to relinquish it
[3:56:38] EmpathyLiveChat: I'm hoping for Dragon Isles
[3:56:39] Tehdoze42069: wow becomes eve online
[3:56:39] Dr_Booom: LIGHT !
[3:56:39] rowbojenn: the chapter of the Jailer's influence is ending and all the stories related to that are getting tied up again
[3:56:40] byrdeen45: the world exploses and we all get deleated
[3:56:40] brodycanuck: 10.0 factions are no longer at war
[3:56:41] 2Pok: TITANS
[3:56:42] Mecabeast: illidans return????
[3:56:44] jerseyfive: back to durotar killing pigs
[3:56:45] Tzarrus: Yeah, Light v Void or Realm of Life with an Azeroth reset
[3:56:46] ArcaneSyntax: that's not what he said though. he said it pulls on threads from Wc3, not that everything led to this.
[3:56:46] Farfic: Wait did they steal the "ending scenario" from FFXIV? Ending the story to start something new lol
[3:56:47] Buttscratchrr: it will go as far as your willing to pay $14.99 a month
[3:56:47] GivTater: @cappaie Kappa
[3:57:00] TitaniumPrime7: towrw
[3:57:08] drewetling: listening to the door's the end
[3:57:08] xXSiebzehnXx: Hanging out with chromie for a whole expansion
[3:57:09] iblighters: The legion was a result of the jailer so that's how they are spinning it
[3:57:10] Xerati404: What happened with Arthas?
[3:57:13] bigoldmeatpie: i think it means something more like sylvannas's story is complete after this
[3:57:16] magemaster225: theyre gonna recreate the ternals movie
[3:57:18] varyaggamer: Factions are important they shoudn't be apart, its faction identity thats important dont erode that.
[3:57:19] TacoMan96: lets get varian back and let him redeem anduin
[3:57:21] Masqerader: Illidan and Sargeras are bros now and Sargeras finally pulls out of Azeroth and she wakens preggo
[3:57:28] Kisswani: I hope soulshapes stay after shadowlands , these are great
[3:57:29] TitaniumPrime7: towellie but what about the big sword. in the planet...
[3:57:30] DuploThief: @Towelliee how can they not have arthas in this patch where did he go after uther threw him  in the maw? where is arthas his redemption
[3:57:31] varyaggamer: Bless ya
[3:57:33] Nokterian: bless you
[3:57:34] valth: not paying it here! nor using gold im still staying away from Wow lol
[3:57:37] rowbojenn: @iblighters they were just saying that the story that started with Arthas is being tied up now
[3:57:45] Funderik: i think people are just reading too much into what he said. the way i took it is steve wants to start making a new story and not have to layer and be careful of old lore.
[3:57:45] rowbojenn: people reading way too much into that statement I think
[3:57:55] nihilistic_bat: A big blue Arthas
[3:57:59] Aeylid: will it be as hard as avatar of sargeras :P
[3:58:05] HexaDroid: So blizzard dripfeeds a small bit of content or info, and now everyone is analyzing every single detail again..
[3:58:06] idenkaz_: the avatar of arthas is the lich king KEKW
[3:58:12] Voramir: first half the fight he's a paladin, second half he's a deathknight
[3:58:13] Farfic: Anduin learns that Arthas is the solution to fight domination
[3:58:14] EmpathyLiveChat: "Father, is it over?" No, you're coming back as a raid boss...
[3:58:16] temp3st98: Probably doing the same to garrosh being ash LUL
[3:58:19] varyaggamer: Narrative problem here is how deeper can we go? I mean who is in the Sepulcher? Cause it means tomb, for one person. So is it a first one tomb
[3:58:26] Kisswani: depends on HOW he loses imo
[3:58:31] izdouble: he knows
[3:58:36] rowbojenn: I just want to lose and come back to Azeroth and it's just Season of Mastery Classic
[3:58:40] theDirtyon3: HE KNOWS
[3:58:41] Aeylid: jailer winning and thats how horde and alliance get cross faction
[3:58:43] xXSiebzehnXx: Jailer probably couldn’t control Arthas so he’s locked away
[3:58:48] Aeylid: jailer snap creates one faction
[3:58:52] Buttscratchrr: it's pretty well obvious that the jailer is gonna win and something will have a big change
[3:58:52] Aeylid: EZ
[3:58:57] Philthhy: when deathwing fucked up azeroth i lost track of what was happening
[3:59:06] Aeylid: we should have gone for the head
[3:59:09] sathreindis: "you should aim for the head"
[3:59:09] varyaggamer: Thats kinda lame, so like no matter what we do we always sorta kinda loose?
[3:59:10] lowlifepuppet1: Arthas is cleaning toilets in Torghast
[3:59:12] FirasG93: @xXSiebzehnXx jailer is a big cuck tbh
[3:59:15] mavericks312: arthas closure makes sense especially with sylvanas having her soul back now
[3:59:16] seidengreif: Arthas turned into maw gollum looking for his precious treasure sword then he will follow anduin to the new raid and bite his hand off to get the new sword
[3:59:16] iblighters: @iblighters Oh I know but Arthas was also a result of the Dreadlords. It kinda ties up everything in a "neat bow" so we can move on
[3:59:19] Todmeister9000: he pulls the sword and Azeroth wakes up
[3:59:24] Funderik: i just hope it's a full cgi cinematic and not an ingame one.
[3:59:40] superset5: they put out a release date for 9.2?
[3:59:54] Kisswani: Honestly this is my favourite part about WoW . How much speculation you can have with regards to the story
[4:00:00] snuffles_80: so many new people they wont have a choice but to restart WoW
[4:00:01] spajdrEX: more binary NPC's
[4:00:03] xXSiebzehnXx: At least they wouldn’t get asked the “what about the giant fucking sword “ question anymore LUL
[4:00:04] sorrel_n: Fresh ideas thank god
[4:00:04] vesarius: not much talent at blizzard anymore though, just woke salespeople
[4:00:07] zuna1904: world of wokecraft
[4:00:09] Philthhy: @Towelliee when is the dreamhaven game coming out
[4:00:10] Furinax: Mike who??
[4:00:13] RitzC: ill believe it when i see it
[4:00:15] cappei: I remember the last time they got a lot of new hires > we got Warlords of Draenor
[4:00:18] o__mj__o: is mike a good addition?
[4:00:24] diln: WoW resets after SL. We go back to vanilla again, but different events unfold like its not Nefarian who runs BWL or Hakkar in ZG, essentially classic+
[4:00:24] N3llee: @Furinax Yabarra .. live under a rock?
[4:00:25] Philthhy: O_O
[4:00:29] BookofFiveRings: I'm happy Christie Golden works for wow. i think Nobbel87 would be awesome working for wow also
[4:00:34] SteveSD: go woke go breoke, maybe they will leanr
[4:00:35] JordiJopie: At least they're changing a little
[4:00:36] Todmeister9000: how much influence does Mike have?
[4:00:43] viopoppinoff: I really do hope Blizzard gets their shit together and makes a comeback into a new era of Blizzard.
[4:00:52] InfamousMaverick: InfamousMaverick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[4:00:52] Lovesomeppl: i think it will be a new cata like
[4:00:55] Strayfellow: wait, so you CAN care less or you COULDN'T care less?
[4:00:59] Densetsu_: I don't think 10.0 will be something "new". It will still be the same WoW with the same stuff.
[4:01:02] o__mj__o: Ion looks depressed
[4:01:07] Kromede: IonJam
[4:01:13] MisterBongwater: I like Ion too but I think his time may have come
[4:01:17] BookofFiveRings: i like Ion too
[4:01:20] ArcaneSyntax: he gave like 3 intereviews
[4:01:23] vesarius: mike defends rmt lol
[4:01:23] brodycanuck: Ion is a mythic raider
[4:01:23] zuna1904: ion is great for the raid design or was
[4:01:31] mavericks312: i think ion is just hard at work on 10.0 an beyond
[4:01:33] Todmeister9000: Ion always looks depressed :(
[4:01:35] JordiJopie: Can't blame a single guy for all the faults in the game tho
[4:01:36] xXSiebzehnXx: I like Ion as well
[4:01:37] brodycanuck: People like to just blame the man in charge
[4:01:39] Merex760: He's still doing interviews at least. Maybe he's gonna go back to just raid design
[4:01:40] GooseComics: No he fucking doesn't lol what the hell kind of game he is playing?
[4:01:41] tydrennistv: I want wow players working on the game. ion needs to stay. player first employee second
[4:01:43] Zerksyera: Wish wow would do something to encourage world pvp
[4:01:47] Kisswani: @vesarius what ???? what are you smoking ?
[4:01:48] Furinax: If they go back to the roots like classic i will be playing that shit
[4:01:51] Quecklain: @vesarius no he doesnt
[4:01:52] cappei: If Ion plays the game more than the other devs. Oh boy oh boy, because he does not engage in his own systems LUL
[4:01:55] RitzC: ion seems like a good dude, just dont think his design philosophy is right for the game
[4:02:00] superset5: did blizz release a date for 9.2 yet??
[4:02:00] disc0dojo: forgive me i am outta touch who is this mike ?
[4:02:06] smashwow: lol what Cappaie said
[4:02:06] GooseComics: Ion is NOT playing teh same game we are playing. That's crazy talk
[4:02:07] rowbojenn: @Goosecomics he's in a mythic progression guild wym
[4:02:11] xXSiebzehnXx: Probably because Ion want to say “shut up whiny nerds” but has to say it in lawyer speak so it doesn’t hit the same
[4:02:14] vesarius: ybarra, he advertises sell runs on his own twitter
[4:02:16] BookofFiveRings: i would like if Ion and Josh got back to doing interviews
[4:02:16] rowbojenn: you can literally track Ion's progress
[4:02:20] Aeylid: ybarra
[4:02:21] 2Pok: Ibarra
[4:02:21] OGXanos: Is Samwise still there?
[4:02:22] Kisswani: @disc0priest Mike Ybarra , leader of blizz
[4:02:23] sorrel_n: Wonder if they want to avoid the rockstar developer mentality from now on so they won't be pushing Ion as much on camera
[4:02:24] Ghost051: E-barra
[4:02:25] Quecklain: @vesarius idiot
[4:02:27] gosu836: Qwip?
[4:02:27] 2Pok: YBARRA
[4:02:27] N3llee: ya-barra
[4:02:31] Nokterian: Leader
[4:02:33] Sarocus: Dear Leader?
[4:02:35] 2Pok: Qwik, yes
[4:02:35] Tzarrus: yeah i think it's like a co-lead or soemthing
[4:02:36] NovaSun84: "co-president"?  I thought there was also a woman there
[4:02:37] browncoats: E-Bar-Ahh
[4:02:38] essehbee: ee-barra
[4:02:38] Nokterian: he is not CEO or President
[4:02:44] o__mj__o: ya barrow power?
[4:02:45] Spaede: @Novasun00 she left
[4:02:48] tydrennistv: bring daddy mentzen back for one more expac
[4:02:48] radkkos: He's the CEO, not presidente
[4:02:51] zuna1904: hes the leader who boosts in wow to pay his own salary by getting people to buy wow tokens.
[4:02:53] xXSiebzehnXx: E-bar-uh
[4:02:57] NovaSun84: FeelsBadMan oh Spaede
[4:03:00] Kromede: he sells boosts Kappa
[4:03:06] valianya: @towelliee  they didn't actually   say this wraps up ALL storylines since Vanilla.  It said 'even some' story threads that old.  This 'book' they're closing with 9.2 is just closing the Chapter of Shadowlands WoW storylines.  I doubt its closing the story on Everything that came before.  They just used encompassing language in video to emphasise their breakaway from the dissappointment of recent years.
[4:03:07] browncoats: @Towelliee E-Bar-Ahh
[4:03:09] luckfore: he hasnt streamed for weeks tho :P
[4:03:10] Herzenliegen: lol
[4:03:14] rowbojenn: @Kromede everyone sells boosts lol
[4:03:21] nielefs: he sells boost for money lol
[4:03:23] theDirtyon3: ALL MYTHIC RAIDERS SELL BOOSTS
[4:03:23] Aeylid: kromede is memeing
[4:03:24] BookofFiveRings: Mike is a real one
[4:03:26] Aeylid: lol
[4:03:26] 2Pok: I have, because he is playin on NA and not on EU 4Head
[4:03:30] vesarius: he sells boosts and his company sells gold yeah
[4:03:32] GooseComics: @Goosecomics 238 ilvl? Hardly mythic progression...
[4:03:32] ArcaneSyntax: literally every mythic raider sells boosts.
[4:03:33] rowbojenn: him selling boosts made me like him more
[4:03:40] rowbojenn: he's one of us for real
[4:03:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah I love having someone in charge who plays the game. Mike and Yoshi P are great
[4:03:43] Masqerader: He doesn't sell boost, his guild has been selling boost for like a decade, I know I am on that server and have friends in that guild
[4:03:43] SteveSD: CEO of blizz sells gold.... lmao GL WoW players
[4:03:44] Quecklain: if someone has a problem with that, that person is part of the real problem
[4:03:45] radkkos: Whats the problem with selling boosts? He sells boosts for gold, not money. Whoever says otherwise is straight up retarded.
[4:03:48] Drenix_10: Ion is great, maybe it’s debatable if he should be game director, but he’s one of the last people I’d blame for current state of wow
[4:03:49] rowbojenn: that's how you know he actually plays
[4:03:53] rowbojenn: doing sales
[4:03:54] Clicklesly: How dare he sell boosts instead of carrying people for free? Kappa
[4:04:01] o__mj__o: its like saying i grind my gold like u guys
[4:04:13] rowbojenn: if he wasn't doing sales I'd question if he even raids
[4:04:15] haplessoverlook: Yeah people getting mad at that kinda cringe
[4:04:16] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @magemaster225 (warning)
[4:04:16] SteveSD: quite the opposite
[4:04:17] ArcaneSyntax: a heroic carry is like 40k hardly enough to buy a token for.
[4:04:18] Templexx: truuuuuee
[4:04:23] Wildside1177: I love the ethics warriors popping up. How do you all make it through the day mad and activist about everything? Calm down.
[4:04:25] sorrel_n: He's just RPing as a mercenary
[4:04:25] Masqerader: @Towelliee to be fair he doesn't sell boost, his guild sells boost, and that guild has been selling boost long before he was in there
[4:04:26] Quecklain: @SteveSD get the f out of here
[4:04:26] Skorb: I can't afford to buy wow tokens to pay for it MiniK
[4:04:28] Dalsonson: Or even Starlight, that’s a pretty safe organization @towelliee
[4:04:32] BadXo: oh it's terrible, but I can't argue with you about it through chat messages. The carries have made the community terrible in wow
[4:04:34] ender_casanova: I new here, greetings from COlombia... Now I love you Towelliee
[4:04:36] Dwyen: imagine being he's guildmate tho haha
[4:04:36] KatPiter: maybe they dont think people with jobs should earn in game gold too LUL
[4:04:39] haplessoverlook: @zuna1904 cringe lol
[4:04:40] notguiilty: Everything is wrong with that what are you talking about....
[4:04:41] Strayfellow: *raiding scene filled with entitled elitists that bought their way up* nawp no problem here
[4:04:42] cozyzequel: !legendary
[4:04:42] gunnhlol: people make up stories of people selling their gold, apes
[4:04:44] jeffnsteff2019: think on my server sylvanas kill on heroic was going 1mil one  time
[4:04:53] zuna1904: people are just tired of reading 24/7 tradechat spam and then seeing the Leader doing the same. Even though boosting is normal
[4:04:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: Doing stuff in game for gold is fine and it has always been a part of the game
[4:04:57] assman_ny: I go on them now and then.  Gives me a chance to see things I don't normally have time to invest in
[4:05:00] radkkos: I dont know how can ppl be this dumb thinking he makes real money out of boosts... dear lord
[4:05:01] rowbojenn: @strayfellow this is a hilarious take lol
[4:05:07] notguiilty: if the game head is reinforcing negative playstyles thne its like giving a green light to these practices
[4:05:08] theDirtyon3: oh 100%
[4:05:10] ChromaticTank: LUL
[4:05:15] 2Pok: IMAGINE HIM BEING AN INITIATE IN THE GUILD 4Head
[4:05:17] herraticc: I would
[4:05:19] Reznr: those guys actually get some 'my dad works at blizzard' clout LUL
[4:05:22] Sarocus: Had to throw Mike a follow. Curious t see how his streams are
[4:05:26] haplessoverlook: LOL
[4:05:28] OGXanos: I used to raid with a CM and we didn't get shit lol
[4:05:30] nielefs: hahaha
[4:05:31] jubee240: @Towelliee i dont get why blizzard bans people casue they will sell carries for gold.  but you can buy wow tokens and make gold that way
[4:05:32] blegobleg: making gold by offer carry is fine why ppl QQuin lollll
[4:05:34] o__mj__o: anyone knows his character name and server?
[4:05:36] valianya: Ybarra is a co-leader with that lady that worked on Diablo 2 remaster, right?  Neither is President or CEO of Blizzard
[4:05:36] GivTater: I would love for a big guild to higher me to grind mats and consumables.
[4:05:39] zuna1904: well community managers back in the day handed out some free xfers here and there
[4:05:46] haplessoverlook: Holy shit I bet Mike has a ban macro on his action bar
[4:05:49] Herzenliegen: It's always been in the game. I remember the gold runs for the raven and bear mount
[4:05:53] rowbojenn: @jubee240 they don't ban people for selling carries for gold?
[4:05:54] notguiilty: why do people need boosting thats what he should be asking and figuring out not supporting it
[4:06:09] superset5: @towelliee any release date for 9.2? apologies for the question spamming
[4:06:09] Mecabeast: bet they can get glitches fixed fast in that guild
[4:06:17] notguiilty: or atleast telling Ion that since he's not part of development
[4:06:18] rowbojenn: @notguiilty people want gear but don't want to play or join a guild
[4:06:20] vesarius: blizzard sells the gold yeah
[4:06:21] rowbojenn: what's wrong with that?
[4:06:22] Masqerader: Yankees spending money trying to boost themselves to a WS, never works out
[4:06:22] vesarius: they don'
[4:06:31] vesarius: they don't mind rmt as long as they get a cut
[4:06:35] SteveSD: WoW need to go free to play
[4:06:36] OGXanos: My only issue I have with gold carries is there's no regulation, costs vary wildly from server to server
[4:06:38] andycoin99: Will carry 15s for gold btw
[4:06:38] rbolude: if blizzard didnt sell gold people would do it, so why not control it
[4:06:49] 0dellil0: they need to focus on long term
[4:06:49] jeffnsteff2019: there was game tokens out before wow had them in everquest2 for like 100 plat be grateful wow tokens dont sell for million
[4:06:51] haplessoverlook: I missed these Wow convos <3 <3 <3 always fun to theorize
[4:06:52] Beet4: @vesarius Blizz doesn't sell gold. They dont print gold. it's redistributed
[4:06:55] Dankmanarmy: TRUE
[4:06:57] aRustyRanger: Not anymore
[4:06:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep, WoW still makes money
[4:06:59] Aidler: on activisions rooster they refer to Mike simply as “Leader, Blizzard Entertainment”
[4:07:01] SteveSD: cause they herd micro transaction whales like cattle
[4:07:05] radkkos: @OGXanos like everything in real life sold by freelancers and such ?
[4:07:05] o__mj__o: @SteveSD who in his right mind will refuse guranteed millions monthly?
[4:07:06] SteveSD: thats not good, thats sad
[4:07:06] brodycanuck: True, WoW is by far the most profitable MMORPG out there atm
[4:07:11] blegobleg: wow still best mmo :P
[4:07:12] BadXo: and the community is terrible because of it
[4:07:15] andycoin99: The cat mount alone lol
[4:07:21] LordKain73: Boy were the haters salty as fuck when they quarterly report came out. You mean WoW isn't dying?!?!
[4:07:22] valianya: Ion hasn't been a great game director the last few years, but he's a great raid/dungeon designer
[4:07:22] Pufendorf99: But people claim the game is dead. How does this add up?
[4:07:23] Fragglevision: think about if they had all the character customization stuff back then
[4:07:27] aRustyRanger: COPIUM
[4:07:28] notguiilty: @rowbojenn why dont people want to join a guild they should discover that...if most players are solo players maybe they should consider putting a solo path for gear...
[4:07:30] flebbooo: yep they chillin LUL
[4:07:34] Reznr: Cat mount makin more than all of Cata LUL
[4:07:36] NinjaGlovz: Worst expansion SO FAR
[4:07:39] vesarius: i think them promoting boosting is what wrecked the game personally, we don't need to agree shrug
[4:07:47] browncoats: @Towelliee Like New world is down to around 100k players?
[4:07:47] theDirtyon3: @contentstarvedgamer lmao
[4:07:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoW makes a lot more per player now than it used to
[4:07:51] SteveSD: we will never know unless we know how many people are on servers like steam games
[4:07:56] viopoppinoff: @contentstarvedgamer He's speaking the facts.
[4:07:56] Ghoost172: @contentstarvedgamer and its sad you are shitty at trolling :)
[4:07:59] Alepouditsa: the do make more money from mounts then expesions
[4:08:01] blegobleg: player left new world already and come back to wow hehe

[4:08:12] rowbojenn: @notguiilty I don't think most players buy boosts, there has to be 15-19 people able to boost for a group of buyers. That implies most people play the game normally and not solo buying boosts
[4:08:17] tomipips11: did toweliee said his ptr/release date predictions yet?
[4:08:17] brodycanuck: Theres still about 2million subs. People say FF is thriving when it has 1.6mill, its weird that people say WoW is dead
[4:08:19] theDirtyon3: i dont think so
[4:08:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, people have been coming back to WoW
[4:08:21] o__mj__o: @blegobleg it was obvious :D
[4:08:25] Arocian: New World had promise but
[4:08:27] BananaCatchUp: New World was ruined
[4:08:29] SteveSD: new world blows wow out of the water
[4:08:37] Athinzi: Those hate comments make me worry about peoples blood pressure.
[4:08:40] luckfore: kekw
[4:08:42] zgag: Blizz should just bring back Chris Metzen full time and everything would be good again in the Wow universe
[4:08:43] daththo_: @Towelliee +195k now
[4:08:44] vesarius: new world lol
[4:08:45] ArcaneSyntax: to be fair, with all the gold and item duping they might as well have a token.
[4:08:46] rowbojenn: @jubee240 the only way that could happen is if he went against ToS and posted it in Group Finder
[4:08:48] Buttscratchrr: new world not a sub to play yet!
[4:08:49] Just1ntime23: 222K playing now
[4:08:50] N3llee: @jubee240 he didnt get banned for the act of selling it. He got banned for the act of advertising it in LFG or trade chat
[4:08:55] Sarocus: New World has 195,510 people online right now
[4:08:56] zuna1904: i dont know. 12million subs vs like 2.5. someone gotta do the math :D
[4:09:01] kaihole: @SteveSD delusional
[4:09:03] duhworks: we need a group server que for outpost rush
[4:09:12] mavericks312: or 3 big patches with no bugs like at launc
[4:09:19] jeffnsteff2019: fix streamline questing

[4:09:27] D3ception: people will not even return to New World imo. It was just a huge hype based on close to nothing
[4:09:30] theDirtyon3: @contentstarvedgamer oh your an asmon viewer i get it now

[4:09:43] jeffnsteff2019: disagree
[4:09:44] Buttscratchrr: Their talk next big patch will have merges
[4:09:57] haplessoverlook: There’s so Many servers on retail
[4:09:59] notguiilty: @rowbojenn what does normally mean...because i been playing wow solo since forever and i know few others who also play solo....WoW is not a mandatory multiplayer game
[4:10:03] rowbojenn: @D3ception I agree with this. People aren't invested in the world or the story, just the gameplay and there will be other games that interest them before New World is fixed
[4:10:08] duhworks: idk why we need to que for it in towns
[4:10:12] jubee240: @N3llee  maybe thats what it was then .  kinda stupid but their house their rules i guess lol
[4:10:15] Masqerader: KInda like me in Battlefield 2042 last night, couldn't get into fuck all
[4:10:52] blegobleg: bf 2042 is a joke loll and full of bot in game...
[4:10:53] Dalsonson: Ys is like 600 people at peak times MAX @towelliee
[4:11:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yep
[4:11:12] rowbojenn: @notguiilty fair enough, and having top quality gear is not required either. You can always join a guild and push or buy a boost. All three ways of playing are your own choice and no one is better than others. I just don't see why buying/selling boosts for gold effects solo players at all
[4:11:23] Athinzi: I'm interested in the Egypt update whenever that comes out.
[4:11:29] haplessoverlook: @towelliee do you think retail WoW needs a server squish? Seems like there is a crazy amount of realms , divides a lot players for guilds etc
[4:11:36] Buttscratchrr: New world will be around for a while! we only seen a very small part of the map
[4:11:36] solsaver12: I'm enjoying New World

[4:12:57] maccaruso: Syndicate and Covenant ditched Ys
[4:13:06] masterlee05: back to wow?
[4:13:11] JangoMigo: do u recomend gw2? @Towelliee
[4:13:16] SteveSD: imagine if WoW showed server pop numbers like steam, people would be raging cause they cant say its not dead
[4:13:24] notguiilty: @rowbojenn well boost buyers have to be solo players because otherwise you would just do the raid with your guild/party....so they need to either figure out why are people preferring to play solo (whether its a playstyle or because the guild system isn't working anymore) rather then supporting a negative playstyle
[4:13:48] brodycanuck: Remember back when people everquest had like 500k players total and people said it was massive?
[4:13:49] Xaviwan078: its fun to see towellie back on wow
[4:13:51] Alepouditsa: @JangoMigo i recoemend ESO
[4:13:54] Buttscratchrr: wait until they add Arena and more rated PVP maps
[4:13:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Renown!
[4:13:54] theDirtyon3: ESO lost most of the good players in PVP to New World
[4:13:56] notguiilty: or put a path for solo players to play mythic
[4:14:08] Xaviwan078: lost ark was cool to
[4:14:10] maybe_torq: Pretty solid yeah, I wonder how many active players Eve has?
[4:14:20] masterlee05: yeah cause New World doesnt require a monthly sub! wow shoud ditch teh sub
[4:14:23] Aeylid: oh no
[4:14:25] FuWeii: New world is a buy to play game....they still made a shit ton of money and sold millions of copies
[4:14:30] Aeylid: i have an itch.....
[4:14:34] JangoMigo: @Alepouditsa why eso over GW2? just curious i have both downloaded
[4:14:35] tydrennistv: do you think will get cross faction raiding in 10.0
[4:14:39] Templexx: 1000%
[4:14:41] BananaCatchUp: MiniK
[4:14:45] Sly_404: thats assuming NW would all of a sudden stop bleeding players which there is no indication for
[4:14:46] radkkos: hahahahahaha
[4:14:47] assman_ny: That looks really good
[4:14:47] Buttscratchrr: Thats what I'm waiting for Lost Ark :D
[4:14:48] radkkos: of all time?
[4:14:49] KillaPr0: to be honest i didnt like it
[4:14:53] Pharaoh_326: they said march 2022
[4:14:55] brodycanuck: @tydrennis for sure
[4:14:56] AgentWhiskeyy: not better than wow still
[4:14:56] Xaviwan078: i play wow but im gonna play lost ark to for sure i play the beta
[4:15:00] ChidaRL: I'd play Lost ark if it had WASD
[4:15:04] paneridas3: they will return @theDirtyon3 new world is a 5 month game tops. I agree that lost ark is fantastic
[4:15:10] Alepouditsa: @JangoMigo GW2 i don't like pvp games
[4:15:14] SteveSD: lost ark is wallet warrior garbage
[4:15:16] Xaviwan078: been play lost ark beta very happy to
[4:15:25] masterlee05: lost ark is way better
[4:15:35] N3llee: @SteveSD educate yourself before you speaking such garbo please
[4:15:36] Xaviwan078: but dont leave wow

[4:16:14] ISirEdwardI: what is number 1
[4:16:14] MisterBongwater: yeah a lot of people sleep on GW2 and they're missing out
[4:16:15] Dalsonson: Yea, I’m likely merging into your server or we both merge into the higher pop on the realmset. Then we’ll have actual faction competition, Heliopolis is Purple Oof controlled @towelliee
[4:16:16] JangoMigo: ohh shizzzzzzzzzzzzzz

[4:18:00] Xaviwan078: but i dont have time to play it all soo stay on wow and lost ark later will see
[4:18:01] OGXanos: I tried GW2 awhile ago, just couldn't get into the story. Starting zones couldn't make me care about the characters.

[4:18:29] Jeanssi: played it in beta and in release, had great leveling, back then it just had 0 pve content in the endgame
[4:18:33] Robix256: @masterlee05 GW2 is actually F2P base game, no sub fee
[4:18:35] Beatchimp: It’s sooo good to see you play wow again !!!
[4:18:36] Lif3l3ss: @masterlee05  gw2 does not have a sub and the base game with no expansions is f2p
[4:18:37] Xaviwan078: new world looks like pvp
[4:19:00] Robix256: @masterlee05 only way to pay is for expansions
[4:19:01] kalamari__: @masterlee05 gw2 never had a sub. it was always b2p, and base game is f2p now for years
[4:19:16] Ignizshun: @Towelliee  so what brought you back to WoW today?
[4:19:28] theDirtyon3: have you been upgrading your cube?
[4:19:29] SteveSD: id rather grind gear score than mount farm and afk in city half the day lol
[4:19:32] masterlee05: @Robix256 @Lif3l3ss yeah dudes but i prefer fully f2p and Lost Ark is giving me that.... after 10 years of wow sub its enough for me i wont spend any more money for mmos
[4:19:48] D3ception: is there any rumoured date when is 9.2 coming out? Or... roughly?
[4:20:02] Throdio: You can get a Death Bound Shard
[4:20:06] andycoin99: @towelliee pvp como stomp is pretty quick for renown if you want a changeup
[4:20:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Adamant vaults can give you a big conduit upgrade
[4:20:11] ChidaRL: deathbound shard 1 time a week
[4:20:19] shadowgrove88: when would 10.0 be if 9.2 is march
[4:20:21] zuna1904: @masterlee05 as if 13 a month for a hobby is much
[4:20:22] Throdio: But otherwise it's a chance at cosmetics and toys
[4:20:25] Jeanssi: was last week
[4:20:35] kalamari__: around the date end of dragons comes out. 100%
[4:20:38] jeffnsteff2019: callin october for 10.0
[4:20:39] luckfore: maybe 9.2 development is very far already and it will release in january hopium
[4:20:40] Dankmanarmy: 9.2 must be february
[4:20:49] andycoin99: Ah my bad
[4:20:50] Dankmanarmy: March would be insane
[4:20:57] NinjaGlovz: towLets PEE

[4:21:08] Masqerader: so 3 months to wait till next
[4:21:08] Pharaoh_326: lost arc is march so 9.2 will be march
[4:21:14] masterlee05: @zuna1904 ofc it is! its so much! i have netflix,prime and wow sub, internet fees etc and living in eastern europe for 400 euros per month LUL every peny counts
[4:21:28] SSD511_: @waznt_me326 exactly LUL
[4:22:02] stratiss: MoP around GW2 release
[4:22:06] D3ception: damn, March? That's crazy... Did we ever have expansion with this little content? I think even WOD did better when it comes to that. This is like 8 months of no content repeating 3 times. I also wonder when they aim to release a new expansion but it seems insane to rush 10.0
[4:22:08] kalamari__: @Waznt_Me326 lost ark's window is from january-march
[4:22:12] OGXanos: yeah the GW2 launch but thats it

[4:41:36] malddktank: i loved castle nathria, SoD not so much
[4:41:51] TheRiwen: I understand. SL also feel like WOD all over again
[4:41:53] Masqerader: Token was like 230 like a week ago
[4:41:55] datcreepa: what went wrong in SL?
[4:42:00] andycoin99: @towelliee what’s your opinion on pushing keys?
[4:42:01] Oly_The_Tank: @Towelliee  That was Blizz's biggest issue now, so many have branched out and tasted whats out there :/ Whats your go to MMO now?
[4:42:10] Dyren03: It's good for a very very few people
[4:42:17] o__mj__o: @datcreepa shitty systems
[4:42:18] OGXanos: The new systems of SL burned me out hard before 9.1 even hit. But I'm getting that itch again.
[4:42:22] SSD511_: True
[4:42:26] Jarlan23: its because you went horde Kappa
[4:42:38] macrophages: do you think it's because your testosterone is lower due to age?

[4:43:17] datcreepa: LUL
[4:43:22] valianya: @towelliee a bunch of new raid designers DID design SoD
[4:43:42] Chaosruler: FF14 once Endwalker is out right?
[4:43:43] TheRiwen: lost ark control feels not good
[4:43:48] Kisswani: FeelsBadMan
[4:43:48] acklesdh: Sadge
[4:43:49] Jarlan23: i wanna try out swtor again. im not liking combat in ff14
[4:43:50] JeanClaudeVanDammeit: fwends :)
[4:43:56] Brewtality55: does Slootbag still play wow?
[4:44:22] Jarlan23: i need procs in my mmo combat or else i get bored
[4:44:28] flebbooo: monkaS
[4:44:29] Jarlan23: and i dont think any jobs in ff have procs
[4:44:35] valianya: Critter murder
[4:44:37] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: Do you think if the raid fights were scaled better, it would be a better raid? Or you want better-designed fights @Towelliee
[4:44:39] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  have u seen the live letter for ff14 and yoshi p's crying?
[4:44:55] gurunoni: @Jarlan23 Did they change combat?
[4:44:59] viopoppinoff: It would be cool if mmo devs worked together and brought content to all of their games with same concepts but different perspectives. Like collaboration events.
[4:44:59] Dyren03: I'm wating for lost ark
[4:45:02] Mallaes: @Rottencoarse Why did he cried? :(
[4:45:06] Jarlan23: @gurunoni in what
[4:45:21] Rottencoarse: @Mallaes  he was upset about delaying the game for 2 more weeks
[4:45:29] gurunoni: @Jarlan23 Did the combat change in swtor?
[4:45:39] BookofFiveRings: you will get it this time
[4:45:45] Jarlan23: @gurunoni no idea. i havent played it since like 2013 or something
[4:45:51] TheRiwen: chorecast is so bad
[4:45:52] BadXo: the maw is SOO FUCKING BORING
[4:45:52] o__mj__o: no variety
[4:45:53] Mallaes: @Rottencoarse Ah
[4:45:53] sorrel_n: WoW needs to go through a long process of learning from other MMOs. Feels like the devs were too isolated from the rest of the genre for years
[4:45:56] mojusk: can yu get to 80 in torghast?
[4:45:58] Jarlan23: i just remember liking it more @gurunoni
[4:46:01] gurunoni: lol gotcha
[4:46:23] Dyren03: Opinions on the class sets? KEKW @Towelliee
[4:46:24] NuAera: legion good example, maybe ToS and Argus being similar
[4:46:25] MexicanMisker: shadowlands feels so "disconnected", its hard to explain
[4:46:27] luckfore: we've only seen like 2 boss rooms, much more to come
[4:46:29] datcreepa: but where will the lore take next in WoW
[4:46:34] theDirtyon3: LUL
[4:46:38] Roblesnarf: KEKW

[4:46:55] Jarlan23: theyre just outta fucking ideas man
[4:46:58] MrNipzOP: thats why everyone quit this game lol
[4:47:03] shadowgrove88: do u think they will ever step away from  borrow power
[4:47:16] Jarlan23: 9.1 was exactly the same as 9.0
[4:47:18] Kisswani: which is the sad thing about SL , the other zones in SL is sooo good
[4:47:19] TheRiwen: I just need wow to go back to warcraft not this we have now
[4:47:40] Thoreya: We’ve been fighting orcs and dragons forever. Don’t get why it has to be that all the time
[4:47:41] MexicanMisker: it was a perfect storm of covid + lawsuits, they fell behind and i think they just threw in the towel and gave up on Shadowlands
[4:47:48] sorrel_n: They need way more evergreen content in the game. Evergreen content means a bad expansion isn't as damaging.
[4:47:48] Mrdarkslayer: have you been playing any new world or waiting for more content too?
[4:47:49] Felldoh_: 10.0 = WoW 2?
[4:47:52] Thoreya: Like it’s been 17 years. Story goes forward
[4:47:57] theDirtyon3: but this has floating rocks...its different trust me
[4:48:00] theDirtyon3: Kappa
[4:48:14] sstriife: i sure hope 10.0 is good

[4:48:22] BrewCityMonk: The copium man... LUL
[4:48:23] Mitune: Took my job as a shaman
[4:48:49] Thoreya: New world has less viewers than wow lmao. Damn
[4:48:53] iblighters: yup
[4:49:05] geturbeanout: NW ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[4:49:15] luckfore: wow has 4x the viewers FF has and 2x the viewers NW has. Dead game btw
[4:49:36] BrewCityMonk: I really want WoW to be good again, but I don't have hope for this new Blizzard
[4:49:46] Mrdarkslayer: once the new areas come out with the new mobs i think it will jump in views again
[4:49:50] Lesliech0w: WoW needs Steve Danuser relocated, if they want ot have a hope of having a cohesive, *good* story.
[4:49:52] o__mj__o: exactly :D
[4:49:58] Jarlan23: WoW also has two games under the same category
[4:50:08] MickyFresc: imagine thinking twitch viewers correlates with the quality of a game LUL
[4:50:20] AmonTheGod: LUL LUL
[4:50:22] MrNipzOP: Wo
[4:50:25] theDirtyon3: dude richs NYC irl stream last nigth was wild KEKW
[4:50:34] TheRiwen: I has know it was there since ff11
[4:50:51] o__mj__o: :D
[4:50:55] w00droh: GW2 isnnt popular on twitch, but its always had a good size player base
[4:50:55] Rudric_Ice: trie
[4:50:56] MickyFresc: yes and no, FFXIV was super popular still, as far as playerbase, but yeah in the greater social space I'd agree
[4:51:02] Rudric_Ice: true
[4:51:11] mavericks312: ff 14 was a basement dweller lets be honest
[4:51:17] Mitune: As Preach just launched his stream for it lol
[4:51:19] OGXanos: wait blizz called asmon an asshole?
[4:51:20] Terranzin: am I the only one getting depressed seing Shadowland content?
[4:51:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah people were going to FFXIV before he said anything
[4:51:40] Lesliech0w: @OGXanos Jeff Hamilton
[4:51:41] viopoppinoff: I'm playing it right now lol
[4:51:42] MickyFresc: @ogxanos sort of, just one person afaik. not a big deal imho
[4:51:43] jerseyfive: ff company should pay him 10mil
[4:51:51] JiMBOJiM69: Havent played shadowlands since Jan, am i missing anything?
[4:51:55] TheRiwen: I am just waiting for the exspansion for ff14 so i play other games while i wait
[4:52:06] thiccsushi: Yeah I wont be watching any streams during endwalker
[4:52:14] Umonkedup: iT FOR SURE WONT
[4:52:17] Umonkedup: Caps
[4:52:21] Lesliech0w: Though, to be fair, J Hamilton is the actual asshole
[4:52:21] Mitune: yep not gonna be watching streams either
[4:52:25] Cristoff90: I
[4:52:33] Kisswani: Sfia hinted at a World First stream for the first tier so that might be hype for a day or 2
[4:52:34] TheRiwen: No
[4:52:36] MickyFresc: @mijobmij i mean technically yes because there is content you haven't done, but whether it's worth doing to you is up to you
[4:52:41] valianya: WoW got into the bad habit of relying on Parasitic systems instead of Evergreen systems.  Parasitic systems are ones that add in content that can be removed and either have no impact or actually make the game more enjoyable with its removal
[4:52:57] TheRiwen: I dont do any of that anymore
[4:52:59] Jarlan23: im still not watching ff streams. im still stuck in heavensward because i wanna save money and get all the xpacs once endwalker launches
[4:53:15] gali5656: yea
[4:53:18] theDirtyon3: it will
[4:53:19] gali5656: or u can get it
[4:53:35] MickyFresc: also there are more people playing NW/XIV and may not be watching it on twitch, because they're actually playing, whereas people might be watching wow but aren't playing it themselves quite so much
[4:53:37] MoonwalkingAngel: meanwhile im enjoying skyrim again with anniversary content after 10 years
[4:54:04] MisterBongwater: you can't rush progress
[4:54:35] MrSkeezyMak: theyre called influencers for a reason
