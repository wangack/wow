[0:12:36] cussmegetban: hope it's working out alright. get well soon
[0:13:03] cussmegetban: phase 2 is a shitshow in terms of guides. a lot of aff erasure and stress on destro
[0:13:48] Matty_Television: aggrend buffs his 2 mains every patch
[0:13:51] cussmegetban: are you caught up on runes?
[0:13:52] Matty_Television: everyone else has been forgotten
[0:14:23] StormiiG: Cheer500
[0:14:40] Matty_Television: paladins can fully kill anyone through bubble cause its all instant cast, so they buffed them by making their spells cost less
[0:14:41] Matty_Television: yktv
[0:14:52] Garrott2: I have been sick off and on for 3 months. I cant get completely well either
[0:14:54] StormiiG: yo np man hope ur doin well

[0:15:14] cussmegetban: just a heads up the dark rider rune portion is excellent exp if you want to get over any hump you're experiencing
[0:15:22] cussmegetban: otherwise ofc also good gold at 40
[0:15:24] austinfilms_: yo yo
[0:15:53] 225jiggacity: !macros
[0:15:54] critcobain: I'm so done with this shit game.
[0:16:06] critcobain: is so fucking annoying to try to do the stv event and its literally nothing but lag
[0:16:08] buggzymalones: sup dude how are you doin tonight?
[0:16:22] cussmegetban: locks are alright. meta + aff still seems to be dominating
[0:16:26] Matty_Television: middle of the pack
[0:16:33] buggzymalones: Yeah was gonna say you sound a little sick
[0:16:49] InfinitePierce: drink a liter of bourbon, itll kill the germs
[0:16:50] Matty_Television: they could use a ltitle love but they are doing okay, at least thats what people say, i dont play lock
[0:17:06] Leobeans: work been kicking your butt??
[0:17:35] duckiezgo: I thought Snutz went into hibernation mode. I havenâ€™t seen this dude in years
[0:17:50] buggzymalones: Lol, so I recently joined the warlock disc. They sing your praise like no other lol.
[0:17:51] critcobain: i cant' even get into gnomer as rogue lmao
[0:17:54] critcobain: so impossible to pug
[0:17:59] austinfilms_: the raid is fun
[0:18:04] buggzymalones: Can you talk a little about lock pvp positioning?
[0:18:07] austinfilms_: im waiting on you for the pvp event
[0:18:13] Matty_Television: this phase is a clusterfuck, so all the idiots love it like crazy
[0:18:13] MarkyOchoa: depends on your class. warrior hate it. i like it as a mage
[0:18:22] cussmegetban: yeah gnomer is a fucking shitshow. it skews toward a ranged-heavy comp for efficiency
[0:18:25] acidagger: we can use the last stv event as a model of it not being good
[0:18:26] net_worth: It's fun. Will last slightly longer than p1 did
[0:18:33] StormiiG: what is the lvl 50 phase raid going to be???? SM????
[0:18:35] austinfilms_: pretty much. was watching sonii earlier. its bad lag though
[0:18:40] duckiezgo: Snutz? do we just go destro now for pvp as lock
[0:18:43] brandon2872: there really isn't enough content. I hope it is shorter than p1 cause p1 was too long
[0:18:45] Matty_Television: game of one shots, everyone dies in one hit
[0:19:09] cussmegetban: yeah pvp is call of duty now
[0:19:15] cussmegetban: if you get hit first you're pretty much dead
[0:19:17] duckiezgo: Snutz? do we just go destro now for pvp as lock??
[0:19:20] Matty_Television: mind blast hits harder than pyroblast XD
[0:19:22] ybeeezy: waaaay to long give me lvl 60 bracket please
[0:19:23] buggzymalones: I dunno how I feel about that... I was kinda hoping I could lvl an alt in SM, if there is a lockout next phase though...
[0:19:31] critcobain: I just don't enjoy it. like, im not having fun this phase. Coming back into wow a bit late and playing catch up, rogues not being great in pve so cant pug into shit at all
[0:19:35] critcobain: stv event laggy
[0:19:36] cussmegetban: @duckiezgo not really
[0:19:37] FreerideAK: Level capping is great, maybe like 2 weeks shorter on the phase though
[0:19:42] net_worth: just reroll priest for pvp
[0:19:53] Matty_Television: rogues are in a very good place rn
[0:19:58] duckiezgo: Snutz is the only pvp lock we have on twitch ðŸ˜¿ if he doesnâ€™t know we will never know
[0:20:00] Leobeans: that would be dope
[0:20:10] critcobain: rogues in pve are meh. like most physical dps
[0:20:43] Leobeans: imagine they ask you to compete in tourney again?? ooof ez
[0:20:46] buggzymalones: hey I think they made it where you want to SL then haunt if you want the full effect
[0:20:56] Matty_Television: melee hunter getting a 30% nerf on tues
[0:20:58] buggzymalones: or is it the other way around?
[0:20:59] Leobeans: oh I see
[0:21:08] TheBarehand: spriest boomies are fuckin rn
[0:21:14] nikthevoker: sup
[0:21:25] buggzymalones: okay gotcha gothca
[0:21:44] Padek_: its the blueberry the best to lvl
[0:21:49] buggzymalones: I know it was broken, and they just fixed it for SL like this week
[0:21:52] nikthevoker: nah, feels like i got a pinched nerve, losing feeling in my hands LUL
[0:21:55] cussmegetban: melee hunters no pet are fucking up fully geared warriors which i guess not a huge surprise but come on man
[0:22:31] nikthevoker: they got nerfed
[0:22:33] critcobain: like, rn i'd rather go play diablo 4 than this bull shit
[0:22:39] buggzymalones: until like later this week lol
[0:22:44] duckiezgo: SNUTZ!!!! donâ€™t forget your BFD Iâ€™m getting almost a full level from it at 31
[0:22:59] nikthevoker: i tried to sched DR appointment they said next year, so we gaming THROUGH LUL
[0:23:09] cyphar007: hey snutz where you been?
[0:23:20] TheBarehand: @duckiezgo i think u stop getting good xp at 35
[0:23:35] nikthevoker: yup life sucks, im used to it
[0:23:44] duckiezgo: @thebarehand I heard opposite itâ€™s 6k per boss
[0:23:57] duckiezgo: Snutz can get a lot of exp doing BFD
[0:24:04] nikthevoker: both, feral is giga geared, like 500+gs 3 pieces left
[0:25:40] bianchi1337lo: gut ripper
[0:25:47] nikthevoker: i found staff of jordan 1st week LUL
[0:25:51] MarkyOchoa: gnomer items aren't even that great tbh

[0:26:41] cussmegetban: gnomer epic neck basically prio'd to melee at this point. for casters hardly an improvement over the bone necklace from bfd or w/e
[0:27:07] austinfilms_: ill heal gnomer
[0:27:18] austinfilms_: went 5/6 in a pug today. its not bad
[0:27:37] austinfilms_: we would have gotten it but the team had a hard stop
[0:27:46] cussmegetban: menagerie is harder to learn but yea last boss harder overall
[0:27:46] TheBarehand: last boss is stupid ez with a lock tank
[0:27:49] austinfilms_: first 4 are easy
[0:28:04] cussmegetban: way more mechanics for the whole raid on menagerie than mekgineer
[0:28:19] nikthevoker: last boss is super easy with ENH tank and or a hunter
[0:28:29] nikthevoker: decoy totem/hunter pet taunt
[0:28:37] TheBarehand: u can kite the first boss' mechanic with searing pain
[0:28:53] nikthevoker: it will be good time when raid 2 stops acting like raid 2 LUL
[0:28:57] cussmegetban: dairy gonna give you more mucus bro!!!
[0:29:10] nikthevoker: you can cheese the mechanic with hunter pet taunt, or decoy totem too

[0:34:04] TheBarehand: yes u can opt out
[0:34:09] Stars69: ya but ally can still kill you
[0:34:10] MarkyOchoa: stv itself isn't fun with all the lag. just get your rings and your cloak and gtfo
[0:34:12] ungryniko: but theres still a shit ton of alliance
