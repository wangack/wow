[3:40:35] FarmerNappy: was talking about Towelliee
[3:40:46] N1GH7M4RE: Jeff Bezos is Cuban
[3:41:12] FarmerNappy: From the Old German beraht, meaning "bright" and ramn, meaning "raven". Taken to mean wise, as ravens were symbols of wisdom.
[3:41:36] FarmerNappy: it is german in origins
[3:42:17] FarmerNappy: bert is Most of these names are early medieval and only a comparatively small fraction remains in modern use. The element -berht has the meaning of "bright", Old English beorht/berht, Old High German beraht/bereht, ultimately from a Common Germanic *berhtaz, from a PIE root *bhereg- "white, bright".
[3:46:08] FarmerNappy: is class comp bis
