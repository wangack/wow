[0:44:51] LunarBrigade: He quit paying Cdew and the bois, so he can afford the ffxiv boost
[0:44:58] Bleedon4: Sadly ya cuz I know he isnt big on story. Boosting is the best thing he can do
[0:45:12] BadXo: who?
[0:45:17] Bleedon4: Asmongold
[0:45:19] Hybridwarhawk: That's true
[0:45:26] Evolutious: he would be fine after he gets past AAT (level 50)
[0:45:37] Evolutious: AAR*
[0:46:06] Broomba: for me, i cant boost i enjoy the leveling and story while getting content and doing the duty and raids
[0:46:12] thensio: yeah take the roids and boost, stuff leveling.
[0:46:13] jasperboy: what did I miss
[0:46:19] LunarBrigade: Honestly, ffxiv is a complete waste of time for him. They ban you instantly for being toxic. He won't last long. Hate to say it.
[0:46:24] Bleedon4: Plus even if he does want to. They have the new game plus system
[0:46:33] Bleedon4: So you can literally go back and do all the story if you care that much about it
[0:46:35] AmZambie: The boost brings you to shadowbringers now with some pretty good gear
[0:46:35] Eviltuna13: i can see it now. no matter what he will call the game shit even if he is having fun just to save face
[0:46:56] abracka_: you'd be surprised what people get banned for on XIV
[0:46:58] AmZambie: I recomend the story for shadowbringers MSQ that was really good
[0:46:58] Boxbound: Towelliee they ban people for even the smallest sligh
[0:47:00] Evolutious: LOLOL they ban literally anyone that is toxic

[5:47:22] BlueBeast33: Nah it was like that on beta, that's just pre-nerf dmg I think
[5:47:47] Kyimo: I just remember our guild losing the off tank one night and asking me to see how far we could go as a solo tank, and then having to solo tank every week ; ;
[5:48:20] Dyspareunia: Has towelliee got some of the loot he wanted?

[5:49:11] apopthis: How was Vegas?
[5:49:33] Bubisaur: 1 taret
[5:49:53] wwishie: It should only hit one player within melee range of Aran and it is important to heal that person as, besides the immediate damage they will take, they will receive a debuff which will deal large amounts of fire damage very quickly. It can be removed via Divine Shield, Ice Block, and Cloak of Shadows.
[5:50:22] badaxxjones: When Wow first came out I used the arrow keys to turn and clicked skills with my left hand and had no idea how in the world I was getting circle strafed.
