[0:21:03] plebcake_: seems a very volatile matchup, both druids are getting blasted
[0:21:30] ionlyplaymetas: is there another cup this weekend??? i thought it was in a month
[0:22:21] ionlyplaymetas: oh okay ty
[0:22:23] doclovejr: hoolibang vs the fiends is gonna be spicy
[0:22:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah this week is cup 2
[0:25:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: ads noooooo
[0:26:07] flameohotmann: you need turbo
[0:26:15] doclovejr: lmaooo

[0:27:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ouch
[0:28:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tony was back on feral
[0:30:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: MVQ was looking good today
[0:31:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa
[0:32:03] johnnythunderbunny: lurkin while i'm workin. on meetings for a while
[0:33:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dex seems really good
[0:33:40] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[0:35:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think with this match, both teams have won rounds
[0:36:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh I see they switch to dev feral
[0:36:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: It seems surprising to me that dev and feral work well together
[0:38:50] TheBackstabi: I'm surprised mana is still even with that dps but I guess if you add everything together
[0:39:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: tough fight
[0:39:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP kitty DxCat
[0:40:01] TheBackstabi: I feel like that raises the question of why not just Outlaw Dev
[0:40:08] TheBackstabi: Not sure if they have it/tried it
[0:40:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hoolibang
[0:40:21] plebcake_: if Cassidy plays DH then they might win there
[0:40:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: And The Fiends
[0:41:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hoolibang is so mean with what they do
[0:42:17] driftwood_tc: what are we watching? This some awc warm up matches?
[0:42:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: This is the AWC open bracket qualifier for cup 2
[0:42:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: EU
[0:42:58] RealXrave: precog is mvq?
[0:43:13] driftwood_tc: oh how come official warcraft twitch does broadcast it?
[0:43:19] driftwood_tc: does not*
[0:43:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: Can thug cleave do goes more often than Hoolibang?
[0:44:10] plebcake_: he’s survival only really
[0:44:34] Szain3: DinoDance
[0:44:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Makes sense to me, the windwalker would have the lowest survivability
[0:44:46] SuperMEX16: @mes any chance at a ui guide for your beautiful ui?
[0:45:45] flameohotmann: comms lawl
[0:45:49] TheBackstabi: This UI feels straight out of MoP
[0:46:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: freaking tiger
[0:47:03] TheBackstabi: I don't mean that bad, just in terms of the art frames and Gladius when most people seemed to move to sArena
[0:48:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: I want to see what Echo is like after last weekend, if they are stronger or shook. I think they come back stronger
[0:49:04] Dacendaren: yo chat
[0:49:13] Dacendaren: good good
[0:50:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Kiting that windwalker is so much harder with a sub on his team
[0:51:36] nikthevoker: O SHIT nethy smoked

[0:59:32] CaptnMurphytv: Hoolibang beat bicmex last week
[0:59:40] CaptnMurphytv: So that probably feels good
[0:59:50] nikthevoker: they got smoked
[1:00:11] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:00:13] CaptnMurphytv: Yeah they destroyed them last week definitely interesting turn around
[1:00:36] nikthevoker: nethy game 3  starting too, lots of EU games
[1:00:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Last week in the open bracket, Echo won a matchup of these comps
[1:01:35] nikthevoker: the focus hunt
[1:03:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah MVQ is a beast
[1:04:14] nikthevoker: killing totems quick, swapping fucks em
[1:04:28] XDCodeman: no idea mvq was eu o.o
[1:04:35] nikthevoker: hes keeping MS on everyone for jaime
[1:05:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Both healers close to OOM
[1:06:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah very close
[1:06:35] lightsflux: damn they were crushing it
[1:07:17] oWcsgo: His Danish
[1:07:24] addyz0r: you are correct
[1:07:28] addyz0r: denmark
[1:08:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lontar managed to get just enough mana back to keep his team solid
[1:08:06] lightsflux: you think they should’ve been on sham a little bit more?
[1:08:09] colindod: do you know if its true this season is ending in march?
[1:08:15] nikthevoker: yup 2-1
[1:08:28] Fueldx: Whats Cdew's druids name????
[1:08:52] addyz0r: cdru

[1:09:31] addyz0r: thanks for streaming. Just got here
[1:09:50] MRRowdyRuff: no lego from raid week 8
[1:10:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's really awesome to see these, for sure
[1:10:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Whoa
[1:11:49] Yacuza: can i get the lego in lfr?
[1:12:16] dawsonator171: only need to do raid one time to get leggo.
[1:13:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: I though DH ele would be the meta comp for EU
[1:16:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Not sure how Whaazz is staying on top with damage, being outlaw
[1:16:13] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[1:16:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: There MVQ passed him on the numbers
[1:17:16] Popcorn921: What do you think of Echo after Mehh quit? was it a big los or is lontar making yp for it
[1:17:43] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[1:18:05] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:19:51] dawsonator171: still sad I didn't make a team for this. WW+Deathwish Fury one shots would have been fun.
[1:20:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those flame rifts are crazy
[1:21:03] Ponycopter: DK talent question: why play Unholy Bond (effectiveness of runefore) instead of Empower rune Weapon?
[1:21:08] sunileif: waaaaaah did i slip into another reality ? mes is awke?
[1:21:34] darkvalley20: echo is lower bracket already?
[1:22:30] dawsonator171: crazy the talent of teams to push these former competitors to the max. niksi and corkiy and clyde not making top 8 last week is actually crazy.
[1:23:06] wowsuomi: Morning
[1:23:39] Xarotic: hello mes, was enjoying watching you all play ww/dk last night
[1:23:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tough fights today
[1:24:35] dawsonator171: it's pretty fresh talent. you heard Jayti in the interview last week.
[1:24:45] wowsuomi: Thats good
[1:24:58] Xarotic: do you think solo q rbg will add more talent?
[1:25:05] darkvalley20: echo upper bracket or lower nracket
[1:25:34] dawsonator171: Jayti and Eradas met each other in high shuffle and added howton. IIRC.
[1:26:25] sunileif: it is bicmex tho
[1:26:31] sunileif: seen him do crazy thigns
[1:27:03] wyldeshock: I was thinking that
[1:27:04] sunileif: D'
[1:27:08] dawsonator171: mes likes thicc things confirme.d
[1:27:11] sunileif: thicc nameplates
[1:27:34] sunileif: i like that over shield displayed
[1:27:40] dawsonator171: I personally hate the black borders on all the buttons and nameplates, chan has something very similar.
[1:27:48] addyz0r: mana not looking good for zen
[1:27:58] wowsuomi: Yeah same
[1:28:13] wyldeshock: that was no wizk link kill
[1:28:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah sub is not trashcan like some of the rogues claim, it's just a kind of lower damage dampener spec that drives them nuts
[1:29:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: They want to be one-shotting people and stuff with it still
[1:30:49] SeeJayX: When are your games? (sorry if its been asked already)
[1:31:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: The NA open bracket is later today, this is still EU
[1:31:54] addyz0r: how does he move? he has scatter on D
[1:32:18] americanmoses18: !bracket
[1:32:18] StreamElements: https://raider.io/events/awc-dragonflight-season-3-cup-1-north-america/brackets/open-bracket
[1:32:25] dpsEric: maybe just qwe
[1:32:39] addyz0r: qwe was it or the reckful zxc
[1:33:09] Xarotic: i need to adopt those types of binds I think.. i currently play wasd+mouse xd
[1:33:36] addyz0r: i'm just so oldskool fps wasd. Anything else confuses me XD
[1:33:51] Xarotic: me too - i need to force myself maybe lol
[1:33:59] Xarotic: asd are some cltuch binds
[1:34:41] Xarotic: rn i have a d bound to turn.. maybe i should move them to strafe instead?
[1:34:59] addyz0r: if i started over i would probably learn to move with mouse and have left free for binds.
[1:35:15] Xarotic: Anyone know what nameplates bicmex is using?
[1:35:26] addyz0r: i dont have turn
[1:35:48] addyz0r: literally the same as moving your mouse :D
[1:36:28] Xarotic: what do u bind ad to @addyz0r ? strage?
[1:36:28] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes

[1:36:56] mayfire15: keyboard i mean
[1:40:11] fullsendingsince96: hello mes
[1:40:14] im_nandy: sweet
[1:40:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: BOOM ratJAM
[1:40:18] addyz0r: dawg down
[1:40:18] im_nandy: surv dmg is crazy
[1:40:30] Xarotic: @mes what are ur movement binds?
[1:41:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Zenlyn is a mega healer, whoa
[1:41:10] fullsendingsince96: i tune into a thug win what a way to start my day
[1:41:18] Xarotic: is a d strafe or turn for u?
[1:43:11] addyz0r: strafe. no one uses turn in pvp
[1:43:41] Ristvakbaen1911: @addyz0r I mean, I do, but I'm also bad lol
[1:43:56] addyz0r: it makes no sense xD
[1:44:21] Ristvakbaen1911: Habit, and I do PvE more. Mostly do 1800 PvP for the mog then call it good
[1:44:24] addyz0r: what do you want to do mid pvp? turn 180 in 5 sec xD
[1:44:37] sunileif: i also have s bound to a non movement, but back peddling as a hunter usually means death
[1:44:53] addyz0r: i'm also terrible but i'm fps gamer and strafe god from ut99 time
[1:44:55] Ristvakbaen1911: I use backpedal to fake casts sometimes
[1:45:32] Ristvakbaen1911: Oh to be clear, I'm definitely not saying it's good or anything XD Just what I do
[1:45:33] sunileif: actually s is disengage so mentally its the same button
[1:45:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Huge damage spike
[1:45:56] Bombdiggity3315: can anyone tell me, I keep hearing rumors that mes is stepping back from comp pvp?
[1:46:09] Ristvakbaen1911: Are these re-runs btw or new qualifiers?
[1:46:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: These are the new open bracket qualifier games for EU
[1:46:32] Jett803: cup 2 quals
[1:46:40] Ristvakbaen1911: Ooooh nice
[1:46:46] Ristvakbaen1911: NA soon then?
[1:47:03] Ristvakbaen1911: Much appreciated ^^
[1:47:14] Ristvakbaen1911: Excited to see y'all play again
[1:47:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Just For Fun did good last week, I think
[1:48:02] Ristvakbaen1911: Side question, what team is TonyFeral on now?
[1:48:10] biofreaks: wowhead has a few more war within class trees released.
[1:48:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tony is on MyWay
[1:48:40] Frukthuset: biggest surprise so far?
[1:48:41] eMBeaR64oz: oh no bicmex healer didn’t have water
[1:48:44] mayfire15: i wish they did top 12 on broadcast
[1:48:54] Ristvakbaen1911: @wEiRdO_dUdE Ahh that's what I remembered, wasn't sure since I didn't see them. Thank you :)
[1:49:16] biofreaks: These games should absolutely be streamed by AWC. its a crime they are not.
[1:49:43] eMBeaR64oz: you should put a little win/loss counter btw if you know the numbers
[1:49:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's a lot of games to cover, and some of the matches are very one-sided
[1:50:06] eMBeaR64oz: I think it’s 2 2 atm
[1:50:09] eMBeaR64oz: yaaaaa
[1:50:11] mayfire15: well they are all happening at once and alot of the first games   just team that arent up to par
[1:50:33] mayfire15: but top 12 would be good
[1:50:46] eMBeaR64oz: I haven’t watched luxia before since this tourny, he’s kinda a vibe lol
[1:50:52] eMBeaR64oz: dunno how him and mvq doing
[1:51:48] eMBeaR64oz: does na games start at a certain time? or just whenever
[1:51:52] mayfire15: just ooming ):
[1:53:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: The openers they do are brutal
[1:53:25] ionlyplaymetas: bicmex being a literal galaxy brain on Surv makes this comp look so good
[1:54:27] eMBeaR64oz: it’s wild how little dam sun does compared to other specs but it’s burst is still decent, wonder how they’d do as outlaw surv tho
[1:54:41] eMBeaR64oz: sub*
[1:55:02] jamesxqp: when does NA start?
[1:55:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: This should be a very tough fight
[1:55:48] eMBeaR64oz: I forgot what they lost to last week
[1:56:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: dev feral
[1:56:34] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[2:00:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blasting the kitty DxCat
[2:00:36] sunileif: hmmm nerf dh after nerfing rogue
[2:01:50] wyldeshock: doesn’t Jaime cheat?
[2:01:57] wyldeshock: or did I hear wrong
[2:02:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: That drama stuff with Jaime was before I got into following AWC, I think he was cleared of any wrongdoing
[2:03:24] voranos: Will we ever see DK meta
[2:03:39] sunileif: udk 2nd on raid dps
[2:03:58] voranos: PvP not PvE, I should have clarified
[2:04:05] TheBackstabi: We'll get DK meta when Mes plays Ele in a tourney
[2:04:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: DK could be meta at some point, I think, it's just a matter of where the tuning is for it
[2:04:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: The hero talents for War Within are looking good for DK, maybe then. Could be season 4 if they tune it better
[2:05:29] eMBeaR64oz: i had a game last night where I got disarmed, lasso'd, feared with no dispell, and incapped on every essence break lol
[2:06:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ferals need some survivability help, that frenzied regen buff was not enough
[2:06:11] eMBeaR64oz: but still topped dam XD
[2:06:54] americanmoses18: mv2 lets go
[2:08:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: WHOA
[2:08:38] TheBackstabi: Sheeeeeesh
[2:08:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: He got dragoned
[2:09:01] TheBackstabi: It was a lot of damage, but kinda just underreacted
[2:09:05] freestylin9: watch your own vod?
[2:09:19] wowsuomi: https://clips.twitch.tv/SpeedyCrypticCrocodileKappaRoss-XtBQKj0jQh-lxzA9
[2:09:56] voranos: Vodception
[2:10:36] sunileif: this is like one of those reacts to himself reacting to a vod of someones else palying
[2:11:00] TheBackstabi: Incarn and Dragonrage, just needed more from something
[2:11:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Healer stunned yep
[2:11:39] MedtnerFangirl: prodigious klepto tbh
[2:11:52] waitimdesyncd: yeah after the dragon sends the go and the dh survives the stun, that isnt the full dam. Netty has only kleptod at that point, and the blue spells after the 2 red aoes is that actual dam
[2:12:30] mayfire15: alot play this comp on eu
[2:12:40] mayfire15: yeah
[2:12:47] mayfire15: feral dev is too

[2:15:51] smokechiefx: MES DURING THE DAY??
[2:15:56] smokechiefx: love to see it

[2:16:54] smokechiefx: Hoolibang in???

[2:17:38] mayfire15: yall should get second seed right?
[2:17:48] voranos: Anyone know what the schedule is, games today then top 8 starts Friday or will there be games tomorrow too?
[2:18:06] Aimed57: who knocked down hoolibang
[2:18:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Fiends knocked down Hoolibang with their thug cleave
[2:18:37] dankgamer97: @Aimed57 Bicmex, rat and zenlyn
[2:18:48] sunileif: you need a facecam with a big 'PAGAN LORD MES' neon light sign
[2:18:53] americanmoses18: damn holli downed by thug? Sadge
[2:19:00] sunileif: or just mes

[2:19:31] sunileif: sup moose

[2:22:12] sunileif: they were imported from canada
[2:22:25] FoxiekittenWoW: whne is na awc starting?
[2:22:46] sunileif: The first moose introduced into New Zealand arrived in 1900 and were released in the Hokitika Valley area
[2:23:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: NA open bracket could be going in a couple of hours, I think
[2:23:48] aitosoosi: nimmari
[2:25:02] sunileif: o by the time of 1952 they all got shot
[2:25:06] americanmoses18: moose biggest predator in canada is orca whales. moose can dive up to 20 feet and are fast swimmers @sunileif
[2:25:18] sunileif: damn that was sad
[2:25:51] sunileif: they imported em via dusky sound and intended to make a game reserve but they didnt thrive T^T
[2:26:14] sunileif: @americanmoses18 thanks americanmooses18
[2:28:02] sunileif: have you seen the new hero talents?
[2:28:07] eMBeaR64oz: oh there were changes??
[2:28:16] eMBeaR64oz: oh is this for expansion
[2:28:19] eMBeaR64oz: ohhhh
[2:29:08] sunileif: dark ranger seems lack luster
[2:29:25] eMBeaR64oz: if theres still 3 treant charges and cdr then yeah
[2:29:30] eMBeaR64oz: thats gonna be a lot of random dot dam
[2:29:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Because boomkins need more moonfire spam, treants blasting it everywhere LUL
[2:29:44] sunileif: it better break all cc
[2:29:49] eMBeaR64oz: protective regrowth
[2:29:51] eMBeaR64oz: wtf thats GOOD
[2:30:00] eMBeaR64oz: 8% DR while regrowth hot up
[2:30:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah these hero talents can be very powerful
[2:30:30] eMBeaR64oz: power of nature
[2:30:34] eMBeaR64oz: you get 5% extra healing XD
[2:30:51] eMBeaR64oz: DUDE WHAT
[2:30:55] eMBeaR64oz: @notmes durability of nature
[2:30:59] eMBeaR64oz: HAHAHA
[2:31:24] eMBeaR64oz: dude what the actual
[2:31:26] eMBeaR64oz: this is insane
[2:31:34] eMBeaR64oz: no you cant extend their wildgrowths either
[2:31:42] eMBeaR64oz: but still another passive hot from treants
[2:31:54] eMBeaR64oz: bountenous bloom
[2:31:55] biofreaks: RMP stocks going up in The War Within.
[2:32:01] eMBeaR64oz: 20% increase treant healing @notmes
[2:32:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: They can drastically tune any of these during alpha and beta this year
[2:32:14] eMBeaR64oz: dude screw this im going into cord
[2:32:19] eMBeaR64oz: im typing too much
[2:32:23] Ristvakbaen1911: I mean, can it get rid of verdancy please
[2:34:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Treants generating astral power

[2:35:20] KingAgato: force of nature is boomkin treants
[2:35:53] biofreaks: Mage is getting Frost Fire Bolt
[2:36:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: And the treants could be dotting everything with moonfire
[2:36:43] esqueuetv: no they don’t
[2:36:43] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[2:37:00] esqueuetv: the wild growth from the trees is basically just purge protection
[2:37:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: The crazy treant stuff might not be too insane if they have low health in PvP and people can kill them
[2:38:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's going to be OP if those treants can't be countered at all
[2:39:25] Trales1: i know theyre op but i fking hate playing with treants so much
[2:39:43] wEiRdO_dUdE: We get it all
[2:40:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: The devs said as we max level we will have it all, and then we just have to make choices on the choice nodes
[2:40:23] Kyltid: how long until the games start?
[2:42:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah we get to pick which hybrid tree we want, of the two available for each spec
[2:42:27] JaeDee: games today? they haven’t even tweeted anything about it
[2:43:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the EU open bracket is finishing up right now, we are waiting on an available stream to watch for the game
[2:43:37] jporter_: are the sham ones out yet?
[2:44:20] mayfire15: need to revert all the pvp nerfs and start over
[2:44:58] mayfire15: na starts at 6?
[2:45:00] eMBeaR64oz: the grove tree seems really good if things stay similarly power scaled
[2:45:12] sunileif: a good walk could be good for ya
[2:45:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: some others are going to be streaming the games too
[2:46:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: RIP hunter
[2:49:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ouch
[2:49:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: I would guess that warrior was going ham on the DK too
[2:54:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: So many numbers going up, whoa
[2:56:30] jamesxqp: you forgot to dark him..
[2:56:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: The warrior seems to go after the DK every time he can
[2:56:50] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[2:58:53] avenueone: u forgot mes
[2:59:02] avenueone: jk i just got here nfi
[2:59:04] neroxztv: he darked
[2:59:21] sunileif: pleny of dark
[2:59:22] wowsuomi: When the dk died right after amz i think his saying
[2:59:33] avenueone: mes is darkness
[3:00:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ouch MyWay didn't make it
[3:00:41] Szain3: DinoDance
[3:00:59] honsou2: just got home is there still games left
[3:01:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah saw a few ferals really struggle today
[3:01:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: I lost a lot of points on those Furbolgs over the weekend
[3:02:14] robby2125: did jaime used to play with swapxy?
[3:02:17] always_sad: swapxy's team vs hoolibang, does the loser not qualify for friday?
[3:03:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I have no idea about Hoolibang's 4th
[3:04:07] eMBeaR64oz: btw just on the left side this is the benefits of that newest tree that id go currently -treants cast moonfire -grove guardians cause dream petal heals -grove guardians nourish apply mini cenarian ward or increase LB+rejuv healing by 5% -Grove guardian healing increased by 20% -Each grove guardian you have increases all healing done by 3%
[3:04:14] HolySutul: when the games start ?
[3:04:18] eMBeaR64oz: then on the right the first one is the 8% dr
[3:04:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Maybe they could bring in a destro
[3:05:18] eMBeaR64oz: youre just gonna be a broccoli-mancer
[3:05:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those new hero talent trees are interesting, I'm definitely going to try to see how they play out
[3:05:50] sunileif: triple ret
[3:05:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: The only good thing about treants casting moonfire is that it may slow down them spamming out heals constantly
[3:06:43] eMBeaR64oz: grove guardians cast moonfire every 6 seconds it says
[3:06:52] eMBeaR64oz: its the only choice on first left node
[3:06:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah once people put a point into it, those little buggers are going to light things up
[3:07:04] avenueone: isnt a sub ww gonna melt a ret tho
[3:07:10] eMBeaR64oz: which if theres still adaptive swam that could be interesting
[3:07:19] eMBeaR64oz: adaptive swarm split*
[3:08:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: The treants are going to be some kind of disco party, with the moonfire and them kind of dancing around spamming out those heals
[3:08:09] eMBeaR64oz: RET WAR FW????
[3:08:11] eMBeaR64oz: ITS THE COMP
[3:08:29] eMBeaR64oz: HAHAHA
[3:08:34] eMBeaR64oz: good comms good comms
[3:08:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ret!!
[3:09:34] NerdEngineering: disc lol
[3:09:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ret war can be so mean, true
[3:09:39] eMBeaR64oz: I know thug is like their thing
[3:09:49] eMBeaR64oz: but I swear if they did ret hunt or dk hunt theyd just do better
[3:10:04] eMBeaR64oz: maybe not dk hunt but... yeah KEKW
[3:10:09] NerdEngineering: Rat on comms is hilarious
[3:10:22] NerdEngineering: complete opposite of Bic and Zen
[3:11:01] NerdEngineering: Best comms though is you chaperoning Chuck and Sam
[3:11:06] maenkins: that comp is disgusting
[3:11:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah yellow is good
[3:11:56] poasa21: lol what is that sheep’s head weapon?
[3:12:23] itstherealloki: wonder if ret warr would beat rogue ww
[3:12:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's a moo-adin, too.... tauren ret
[3:13:11] eMBeaR64oz: fw fails to heal when being kited, CCs that dont break or super high damage during stuns
[3:13:30] eMBeaR64oz: which im not sure if thug can really get to with a ret on other side
[3:14:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: That was a good try with the ROP
[3:14:41] NerdEngineering: you can learn so much just from watching how Bicmex positions
[3:16:13] eMBeaR64oz: rats type of english accent I wanna hear him say "beans on toast with bangers and mash"
[3:16:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah flying up would make sense
[3:18:00] eMBeaR64oz: I was just gonna ask about hpriest mana
[3:18:00] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[3:18:03] eMBeaR64oz: but i heard oom
[3:19:41] eMBeaR64oz: vanish into evasion can save rat

[3:20:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tough fight
[3:21:04] americanmoses18: poor fiends
[3:21:11] eMBeaR64oz: sub damage is kinda tragic in those long games
[3:21:13] eMBeaR64oz: for mana wars
[3:21:52] glitteris69: is everyone dropping 4 set for full vers gear?
[3:22:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: I know people hate fistweavers
[3:22:14] glitteris69: i think SV is
[3:22:15] TheEyeVII: what's up
[3:22:15] eMBeaR64oz: for what specs?
[3:22:36] eMBeaR64oz: I think i saw dannycarry at 8% vers XD
[3:22:50] eMBeaR64oz: dude is off the deep end and in the abyss
[3:23:06] lord_broldamort: I feel like outlaw and BM may be a better choice instead of surv and sub
[3:23:45] eMBeaR64oz: yeah maybe but bicmex is just such high xp with sv thats kinda his thing
[3:23:57] eMBeaR64oz: thatd be like snupy going moonkin or somethin
[3:24:00] eMBeaR64oz: haha
[3:24:23] Pillahump: is tauren the most optimal ret spec ya think?
[3:24:39] eMBeaR64oz: also hpriest prolly a crux as well
[3:24:49] eMBeaR64oz: mainly just there for crossing for this comp
[3:25:25] eMBeaR64oz: HAHAHA good comms good comms

[3:35:33] sunileif: idk he played a clip once of when it sounded angryer
[3:35:43] sunileif: it was intense
[3:36:04] sunileif: in all fairness that kinda blood lust was useful 600 years ago
[3:36:34] Bronloch: 600? LUL try 50
[3:36:39] crazycorgis: how bad are hunters? bicmex looked useless and was just dying all game

[3:41:42] mayfire15: doesnt mean mes cant
[3:42:26] waitimdesyncd: what are you more excited for of the new dk specs? Sanlayn or Rider of the apocalypse? I personlly like the blood vampyre aestetic for a DK, but the thought of using mount in combat sounds intriqueing too
[3:43:27] waitimdesyncd: https://www.wowhead.com/news/first-look-at-hero-talents-in-the-war-within-336814
[3:43:31] waitimdesyncd: they have shown sanlayn
[3:43:36] Deyconn: when do NA quals start?
[3:43:48] waitimdesyncd: no riders is still a mystery
[3:44:20] honsou2: a mount sounds pretty meh
[3:44:50] waitimdesyncd: In legion they made a big deal out of riders of the apocalypse with the fighting on mount in the open world.
[3:46:36] Anhak: Kermit: less than 24 hour warning
[3:47:04] ItszBigMeecH: ui
[3:48:19] waitimdesyncd: I assume it will replace deaths advance or IBF or something like that. They have scratched every version of it theyve tried just semi
[3:48:38] magnesiium1: is awc over for today already?
[3:48:43] sunileif: maybe its like the torghast thing where morgraine aids you in battle
[3:49:25] mayfire15: damn swapxy is fighting hoolibang
[3:49:32] waitimdesyncd: @sunileif  thats actually 200iq called out. It might just be the torghast "pet" with mograine
[3:49:46] mayfire15: im using it

[5:17:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the orange debuff is the axe dot, they say it's nerfed like 70% in PvP but it's still something
[5:17:29] fejiwow: is the dot nerfed i thought it was the uh on use
