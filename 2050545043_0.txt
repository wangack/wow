[0:16:20] Vigi9413: i liked that you swapped through like every team
[0:16:22] yowler_: thats one big manly orc
[0:16:23] CabinetMistake: just out of curiosity has arcane been good all xpac or is it a recent thing with patches?
[0:16:36] dailyshuffle: yoo ven, i made a new daily shuffle episode with some nice awc clips, you will like it LUL
[0:16:50] Kikrino: Watch party was fun cause I looked at all the diffrent teams tbh. And we vote 10/10 for dorito/saul 2vs2 cause their comp is something else
[0:16:55] ur_boy_jd: i always peep out a watch party for the cups but only the ones that don't mute the elite play by play

[0:20:36] Hotrecki: have you considered trying to play in awc again? or not worth for you?
[0:20:37] srirachuhh_sauce: just came back from a 4 year stent
[0:20:40] diperna99: Whats the small proc indicator on fire above the character?

[0:24:23] TypicalCalibri: dark pact scales off of current health
[0:24:26] CabinetMistake: ah alright

[0:25:25] TypicalCalibri: its like using altar at full heaklth
[0:25:47] SerFloyd: are the queues that bad at lower ranks?
[0:25:59] yowler_: this lobby is such a healer nightmare
[0:26:14] TypicalCalibri: queues are better at low rating because there are more low ranked players

[0:42:59] starskedc: amazing expac
[0:43:01] oxy4real: its not that important, but it has something to do with the toxicity of some people

[0:43:14] tea_berri: have a great night ven
[0:43:50] oxy4real: its screenshots of chat whispers i got while trying to play a healer for the first time in wow

[0:44:39] oxy4real: those one today hurt man @chrisiirc
[0:44:39] tea_berri: i agree close that shit out
[0:44:43] CabinetMistake: hard to find a good set of flaming cloth shoulders i feel like
[0:44:44] yesterday_potato: late night ven lets go
[0:44:56] chrisiirc: i never read them because its like allowing poison into your mind.
[0:45:01] Scargon231: i heard someone say "look cool, play cool". and honestly, they're right
[0:45:28] rekt1370: @havenblood  no but 1 handers get 2 weapon enchants making it better
[0:45:34] CabinetMistake: yeah i feel like i play better if i'm happier with my mog lol
[0:46:05] Badasti: “He who takes offense when offense was not intended is a fool, yet he who takes offense when offense is intended is an even greater fool for he has succumbed to the will of his adversary.” ― Brigham Young
[0:46:08] yesterday_potato: especially healing ss
[0:46:15] rekt1370: i was on my spriest this dh died without pressing any defensives one so ever not blur
[0:46:19] rekt1370: then he flamed me for not swapping him
[0:46:28] frankybllaze: looks like bean again
[0:46:37] yesterday_potato: just que and move on with instant ques brother
[0:46:43] chrisiirc: its true but its victim blaming in a way
[0:46:48] CabinetMistake: only shame is the guy who said it lol
[0:46:53] Badasti: heard it in a psychology video yesterday, thought it was good too :)
[0:46:59] blueberrypieface: words to live by when playing shuffle :D
[0:47:02] oxy4real: y this guy was so toxic he sent me a pictures of his glad mounts and said "you will never get those" that was so funny actually @venruki
[0:47:09] chrisiirc: its like saying "youre an idiot for being upset at being abused"
[0:47:14] SteLawBro: Talk shit, get hit - Everybody else
[0:47:18] jjc7728: when people whisper me I always just tell them "I bet you look like you play WoW irl"
[0:47:18] chrisiirc: idk just my thoughts
[0:47:38] DoYouSeeOk: @oxy4real just say youre right i wont be paying for carries and watch him get mad :P
[0:48:03] knappster15: Do tanks take more dmg in PVP?
[0:48:03] oxy4real: @DoYouSeeOk maybe i should do so :D
[0:48:11] rekt1370: best is the guys that link the one time they got glad in bfa or shadowlands
[0:48:21] rekt1370: when it was the easiest time to get glad
[0:48:27] rekt1370: glad in bfa and sl is like 1800 df
[0:48:43] CabinetMistake: rip bean
[0:48:45] yesterday_potato: dang im a glad then
[0:48:56] rekt1370: people had 4k rating in bfa and sl
[0:49:17] DoYouSeeOk: @rekt1370 had a guy send me one from like 10 years ago but got no other glad title LOL
[0:49:33] rekt1370: yea man legit guy sends me a bfa telling me hes glad and how good he is
[0:49:33] nikthevoker: BROTHABEAN!
[0:49:36] rekt1370: when hes playing terrible
[0:49:42] chrisiirc: ye, sometimes even writing things out is a good WAY TO VENT
[0:49:48] harrystyIez: just write it down like u would a journal haha
[0:49:54] Hazythe4Saken: not theraputic.... cathartic
[0:49:58] babybirdzhel: same with overly aggressive work emails
[0:50:40] DoYouSeeOk: best way to deal with them fools is to just troll em hard :P  make em rage and say nono words then report
[0:51:32] chrisiirc: pun intended
[0:51:43] oxy4real: i actually reported him
[0:51:49] oxy4real: not sure if things gonna happen tho
[0:51:49] Cerion17: I just love when a dps goes 0/6 and they blame the healers xD
[0:52:06] DoYouSeeOk: @oxy4real unless he said actual TOS words in messages nahhh
[0:52:21] jjc7728: honestly idc what someone says to me but if you are atleast gonna talk shit dont ignore me before I can respond
[0:52:22] yesterday_potato: sp ruki when?
[0:52:40] DoYouSeeOk: @Cerion17 rule #1 as dps in solo shuffle - always blame the healer
[0:53:19] ottones: What is the name of the addon that shows the coldown of enemy spells?
[0:53:30] chrisiirc: its so risky to blame a healer because youve got so much more to lose as a dps lol
[0:53:40] oxy4real: @DoYouSeeOk feelsbad, idk how new people should engage pvp if they get treated like that. Its not League where u que in and people dont have a choice but play the best. In wow they can just remove you and replace you. It is not like in other games.
[0:54:03] chrisiirc: healers get those insta q's and will happily throw games
[0:54:55] wackpoetic: chrisiirc true, I had a DH be toxic and yell at me as the healer and it was the easiest throw/report when he was on my round
[0:54:57] chrisiirc: not to mention possibility of your healer griefing you for your toxicity
[0:55:13] chrisiirc: @wackpoetic lmao i do the same man
[0:55:40] TheEyeVII: what mmr is that
[0:56:17] wackpoetic: Toxic DH's or Sub Rogues that complain about stun DR are almost guaranteed throw/report
[0:56:27] tea_berri: that was an insane rond
[0:56:29] tea_berri: rnd
[0:57:24] idiot_63: rund
[0:59:36] yesterday_potato: hard agree
[0:59:38] not_jsn: slurp up all that rating from bean
[0:59:38] magixss: indeed
[0:59:45] Badasti: DH died and feral lived - most likely to first blood vs least likely LUL
[0:59:49] Badasti: interesting outcome
[0:59:57] yesterday_potato: getting the grenade first three rounds the opposite
[0:59:59] Msv2: Fire mage bangz
[1:00:01] Tyferious: @venruki can you link that youtube video you played the other day. its like the struggles of healing
[1:00:26] limit77: InuyoFace

[3:30:55] trikkSP: sadly
[3:31:44] milcah_us_illidan: I wasn't aware they suck it ruined my favorite game CS 1.3
[3:32:29] trikkSP: @milcah_us_illidan botting is especially easy in wow due to we are able to edit the LUA code. there is a reason that addons are not a thing in newer mmos etc :)
[3:32:52] milcah_us_illidan: I thought blizzard would have a better handle on than valve
[3:33:28] milcah_us_illidan: That's heart breaking

[3:33:34] heho1231: point
[3:33:45] trikkSP: sorely mistaken, the games that does this best is valorant / riotgames since their anticheat is kernel based
[3:33:51] trikkSP: @heho1231 oh yeah baby
[3:34:59] heho1231: @trikkSP feel like more people cheat in val than you think but you cant watch fucking demos to confirm unlike cs
[3:34:59] milcah_us_illidan: Frustrating to say the least
[3:35:50] trikkSP: @heho1231 well, nothing is foolproof, but it is a fact that riot anticheat is better than valves.
[3:36:17] heho1231: true especially league
[3:36:18] Moobot: Latest video "The Casual PvP Community Is Begging For Help" view it here: youtu.be/ztKSy4IjNfo

[3:37:10] milcah_us_illidan: You don't know who he is
