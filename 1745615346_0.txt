[7:24:53] dschmidt: it should turn red since you are tracking it
[7:25:08] TheMachine_907: theres an addon for that
[7:25:58] PvtHudson093: extra action button and target the person
[7:27:19] Wukain: 6

[7:29:31] Snabido: So PvPers cant do this? 😏
[7:29:41] Foretoldlegends: Or just ask for mages only.

[7:29:46] Wukain: take all mages
[7:30:26] silversoidier: do warloc portals work or nah
[7:31:19] DunzoCD: maybe not gateway, but the circle should be like a blink right?
[7:31:27] MethSotto: warlock . warrior. mages. demon hunters
[7:31:33] silversoidier: i guess portals consider it moving
[7:33:08] keraa31: what is the strogest class for beginers ?

[7:34:27] tumb_tack: Druid tank is really easy
[7:34:38] xHukk: BM hunter is really snooze mode.  I'd say MM and Survival are not as user friendly  BM hunter or Havoc DH I'd say for someone new.
[7:34:53] DunzoCD: does an evoker moving somebody count as that person moving?
[7:35:13] xHukk: @DunzoCD did the person move? form one place to another?

[7:36:27] DunzoCD: @xHukk eh you never know how games register stuff sometimes, was just a thought
[7:37:02] Snabido: It's a click-on-ground button, aint it? Or target
[7:37:44] turfjitsu: ground target ability like healing rain efflo
[7:37:51] xHukk: @DunzoCD sure I get that.  Just seems like the idea at all just over complicates its all.  Don't always need a loop hole just for the sake of using it.  Just follow the rules and should be easy clap.
[7:38:24] SuperLost89: calling it now. one of the mages is going to move after their blink
[7:39:02] xHukk: @SuperLost89 :D
[7:39:18] stonyman187: edsf
