[2:11:31] Erielle04: TBC beta announcement this week?
[2:11:44] BlueBeast33: Nothing is allowed to go right for WoW right now apparently
[2:12:14] typhoxtv: she's just chilling in a house
[2:12:15] FdMrr: is warrior any good for tbc?
[2:12:15] Zuelase: You thinkin about maining that druid for TBC?
[2:12:21] Jared948: Going to head off, almost 4am and getting really tired lol, glad I could catch ya man :)
[2:12:42] Hjolt: i have this itch to reinstall classic and continue to casually level a mage, but something tells me its not a good idea
[2:13:28] Devildriver007: How was retri in TBC?
[2:13:36] Corbic247: YEP
[2:13:38] Ranger208: yes
[2:13:40] Corbic247: first one is free
[2:13:41] Zuelase: Can't wait to play my Paladin as well, it's gonna be good
[2:13:44] markmclean24: yes
[2:13:47] Sluggs_: the epic one costs money for mats
[2:13:48] typhoxtv: you think 58 boost will be in prepatch or at tbc launch
[2:13:49] beckett3a: free epic mount?
[2:13:52] Rensiur: Morning folks
[2:13:59] bobbyhennings: slow mount is free i think
[2:14:02] Zuelase: You do, but I think in prepatch the riding costs of the mount and the training are flipped so you have to pay more for riding.
[2:14:06] Hjolt: draenai paladins tho...
[2:14:08] Dalsonson: Free 20, Discounted 60. Same for Warlocks
[2:14:12] Corbic247: epic cost money for mats,
[2:14:13] Sluggs_: you need a bunch of mats which cost about same as an epic mount
[2:14:25] VrtniPatuljak: Draenai > Belf pala, big bois win
[2:14:29] Flenidalap: your level 40 mount is like 1 gold to learn but the lvel 60 mount you have to do a huge quest line that cost LOTS of gold
[2:14:31] Rensiur: I kinda remember Retri to meh - That was why I switched to druid during in TBC and the changeover to Wrath
[2:14:36] typhoxtv: the mats are alot cheaper now though
[2:14:40] CDubTheRIPper: danHmm
[2:14:45] Ranger208: that's fair
[2:14:47] flanders61: pally epic mount quest is around 450g
[2:14:54] Jared948: 10%rep
[2:14:57] Hjolt: the absurdity of their huge-ass mount is hard to argue with. but yes. practicality is always better.
[2:14:57] c0gnusTV: pally quest is same for BE?
[2:14:59] Hjolt: Kappa
[2:14:59] Zansteh: pgeOhno
[2:15:05] VrtniPatuljak: I prefer THICC over stats
[2:15:05] Rensiur: danF
[2:15:06] Clicklesly: Did Belfs get the quest though? I just remember learning the normal mount from a trainer back then, not sure about epic
[2:15:07] flanders61: yea
[2:15:08] GarSeason: Boosted? Theres no geared paladins on the horde side to boost ya lol
[2:15:09] RogueBear: gift of the naru LUL
[2:15:16] kirtyalex: same as warlocks
[2:15:18] raymond3195: torrent 2 min cd so mehh

[2:15:51] Hjolt: hellfire mount bombardment PTSD
[2:16:06] Zuelase: can't wait for my level 30 mount
[2:16:11] flanders61: pallies are a bit more balanced with seal of blood
[2:16:16] flanders61: but BE is BIS pally
[2:16:17] typhoxtv: too many simps for belfs
[2:16:19] kredz13: idk the free hit from dranie is pre good
[2:16:19] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: male belf KappaPride
[2:16:22] Maego1: Blood Elf invasion
[2:16:27] Hjolt: i don't think there's a single soul who thinks Draenai> Belf unironically. It's just the memes
[2:16:27] chrslp: Isnt Azuresong like 70+% Alliance?
[2:16:29] Corbic247: basic flying is 700g, epic is 5k
[2:16:32] Jared948: 1k -->5k
[2:16:34] VrtniPatuljak: Clicklesly there is a quest, maybe got free at end
[2:17:04] Sluggs_: reason to go draenei is the 1% hit
[2:17:04] tumppigo: Don't forget the +1 hit...
[2:17:06] kredz13: people pay 30k gold for naxx items, 5k for epic is nothing
[2:17:13] dreka: is paladin good in bc
[2:17:16] Hjolt: arenas, too.
[2:17:17] Denzlight: Can't wait to benefit from the swift flying from of my druid YEP
[2:17:33] Dalsonson: Mechanar
[2:17:49] Denzlight: Ofc
[2:17:50] Sluggs_: druids have a quest to get epic flight form
[2:17:51] Ranger208: I think there's a quest for swift form but yes
[2:17:52] Jared948: yes
[2:17:52] typhoxtv: these flight routes make no sense.....
[2:17:52] Sandisy: yup, lvl 68
[2:17:54] Hjolt: yes, ofc.
[2:17:55] dreka: was paladin good compared to other classes in arenas or dungeons
[2:18:01] Clicklesly: People are way too used to every class having interrupts now i guess ^^
[2:18:05] chrslp: Normal flight form isnt free though. You still need the riding skill
[2:18:06] Denzlight: Yeah they do
[2:18:06] tyrexxi: flying is 5k?
[2:18:07] chrslp: Yea
[2:18:12] danimoto10: Good morning all! tow hope yor skin thing going well towHi
[2:18:19] chrslp: You pay separately for the riding skill
[2:18:39] Sluggs_: but still worth getting epic flight form for that herbing alone
[2:18:44] raymond3195: if taurens could be pally you would go taurens we all know your belt hate
[2:18:53] Hjolt: thematically it was always funny. druids learn how to ride themselves Kappa
[2:18:56] chrslp: The biggest benefit of druids if having flight form 2 levels before anyone else is flying
[2:18:57] raymond3195: belf
[2:19:05] GarSeason: @Towelliee Male or Female belf tho
[2:19:10] XanninN: druids would do the quest for summoning anzu alone the flight form is a bonus

[2:21:26] Ranger208: am I the only one who never even thought about that and just made a char i liked?
[2:21:26] Flenidalap: i always go female.  if im gonna look at a chars ass for hours.  might as well be a females ass

[2:23:00] RageQTT: I mean it's mostly cause the female model for the most part just looks better than the male one, atleast on the ally side. Like look at male nelf, retarted running animation...
[2:23:01] VrtniPatuljak: Xanninn back then we didnt have voice changers, barely had voice chat

[2:45:34] Mitune: 45 i think is the lowest end
[2:45:34] Felrane: 44 is fine
[2:45:35] Sluggs_: mid 40s
[2:45:45] rottenbanana64: i checked the website.. dont qualify :(

[2:46:22] TheUnknowing: I'm on a waiting list for the vaccine, cant wait.
[2:46:28] SaltySandman__: @elloonious And that is the whole reason we had to wait over 2 months for the complete covenant campaign ... They want you to lock in the game and keep you in the loop instead of a straight sprint like classic. Fuck i spoiled blizzards moneymaking trick. Now they will send assassins after me.
[2:46:32] Mitune: cause state rights for some reason
[2:46:44] mrwilsoncw: @Towelliee if your pro you can go in with a lower lvl lol
[2:46:47] rottenbanana64: because of population density .. and the distribution problems with the vaccine.
[2:46:55] mrwilsoncw: @Towelliee what server ya on?
[2:47:00] Rensiur: Oh the lovely times without the atrocious Group Finder
[2:47:23] Kerminal: what server is this?
[2:47:26] elloonious: Depends on your health dept and Gov. and how good they are at their jobs
[2:47:26] Vexxsis: best times you mean
[2:47:39] rottenbanana64: take Montana eg - very very spread out and thin density. unlike Cali/NortEast or the SouthEast.

[2:50:15] Mitune: Have you gotten that feral energy helmet yet @Towelliee
[2:50:20] TheUnknowing: yeah you probably wont be tanking much

[2:54:37] Supers18: Towelliee how can they be this incompetent?
[2:54:40] Mitune: I really hope the TBC beta happens super soon, and that if they dont invite a ton they at least do the 1 to 15 beta equivalent for it
[2:54:49] Vexxsis: @lovejuice_  rogues are beautiful in tbc
[2:54:58] massey910: @lovejuice_ yeah rogue is the best class for pvp arena

[2:55:11] markmclean24: surely to christ they can buy vaccines
[2:55:14] xBanosh: what do you think about reducing respecc costs in TBC to max 5g if they opt to not give dual specc?
[2:55:14] zenniik: idm, i still havent got my keystone master and people are so strict with rio
[2:55:17] Sluggs_: 2021 is gonna be a slow year for all games
[2:55:18] lanara233: Ha, true
[2:55:18] Vexxsis: hemo/mace spec for rogues hands down
[2:55:20] Supers18: Didnt in an interview they said 9.1 will be on the PTR soon after 9.0.5 release @Towelliee
[2:55:25] GraaMee: Have to remember they have 2 versions of wow now so it makes sense to me to bounce between the 2 versions and have longer patch lengths
[2:55:40] Vexxsis: some good mute specs also for pvp
[2:55:43] Mitune: TBC will hopefully carry
[2:55:44] raymond3195: not all staff would be at home

[4:13:25] swampt1l: nah i cant wait for Classic BFA

[4:13:27] elloonious: Respawns due to 3 hour tour
[4:13:43] pukeeyyy: what are your thoughts?
[4:13:43] Kromede: play D3 for a while SwapT1_ or GW2
[4:13:56] No_Panda: @stinkypanda_ oh they for sure will do wotlk
[4:13:57] Demorase: you can already get boosted by paying mages anyway
[4:14:20] NickLeonhearth: Kinda wish those content creators would stay in their vanilla bubble...but hey, gotta follow the trend whats how on twitch
[4:14:27] CasualSCN: Boosts are cringe
[4:14:43] GoeglerenDK: but but, it will ruin the journey. a lot of us old boomers like myself, I enjoy the journey isnt ending within 2 months of a new expansions
[4:14:55] Kromede: 58 boost is fine with me, i detest leveling after doing it for at least 100 times
[4:14:56] theimmortalsin: vanilla icecream? too?
[4:15:04] mmrghost7: vanilla bobble LUL
[4:15:15] Secondbreakfasttt: @CasualSCN  speak for yourself buddy
[4:15:16] BlueBeast33: I think it'd be bad if it was unlimited, and I think Blizz knows that which is why it's just 1 per account
[4:15:21] Demorase: classic is nothing like vanilla in the way people play the game lol
[4:15:23] h_u_r_k_: you think you do, but you dont Kappa
[4:15:30] swampt1l: kinda just logging in tuesday and trying to get illdan glaive and thunderfury @Kromede
[4:15:31] No_Panda: mages are selling boosts for 1,5 years now so lvl58 boost from blizz is not an issue for average player
[4:15:44] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee I mean TBC is a 14 year old game, leveling in it isnt playing the game, the game starts after you are 70, so boost makes sense
[4:15:46] CasualSCN: @qblayy quinYikes
[4:15:55] No_Panda: @demorase 100%
[4:16:02] GoeglerenDK: but you still have to have gold panda to pay mages, a new started player wont have the gold, like myself
[4:16:06] eziz86: Not yet beta release ?
[4:16:06] Szepkah: Imagine what else going to go into Classic Cash shop. Can't wait for BT Attunment for 39.99
[4:16:20] AshixBorden: Boosts have been in the game since 2014 at this point anyway
[4:16:28] Secondbreakfasttt: @CasualSCN towRee
[4:16:53] Pufendorf99: Vanilla was the beta, TBC the game
[4:17:06] KrysKryngles: hey Towlliee, what's the best way friends and I can prepare for TBC
[4:17:10] Daccotacco: i would buy that  boost for sure
[4:17:19] No_Panda: @goeglerendk ye, they are getting gold illegally with real money so all the profit goes right NOT to the blizzard hands this way
[4:17:26] Demorase: gold token would prolly be good for the game too to reduce botting

[4:17:58] GoeglerenDK: @xanarel22  not really
[4:18:01] F1uox: No cam :(
[4:18:03] sprert: Tin foil hat on: Blizzard uses the boost to increase the bot count to have a legitimate reason to introduce wow token
[4:18:09] FluskB: @xanarel22  Ofc much pvp and world pvp
[4:18:17] Daccotacco: @Towelliee tell us
[4:18:18] BlueBeast33: 60-70 still takes a while, it's like around the time it takes for 1-40
[4:18:19] borismcgee: All botters use bots to boost their other botting accounts, not having the boost won't stop bots overall. It will just slow them down a small amount.
[4:18:20] DreavT2K: do proffesions get boosted to?
[4:18:39] theimmortalsin: TOKENSSS
[4:18:39] AshixBorden: No profession boost
[4:18:46] No_Panda: @xanarel22 you can arena, or you can just level up alts and professions to make gold and play on auction house
[4:18:47] Kman3107: 1 hour? Give me a few days to rant LUL

[4:18:52] Demorase: so many people buy gold already
[4:18:56] h_u_r_k_: 1-40 wtf no way
[4:19:00] pukeeyyy: -old world abandoned/bots get worse/easier tocheat/p2w/ i think the only one i agree with is he said they may speed up a lot of other cash services
[4:19:06] Szepkah: He had a good point saying that if someone is patient enough to level 1-60 how are they going to be resilient enough to do the attunment and struff?
[4:19:08] durtyspritewow: 1-60 takes sooooooo long
[4:19:08] NickLeonhearth: 60-70 is 15-18h gameplay
[4:19:09] BlueBeast33: I remember Joana saying that, also 1-40 doesn
[4:19:14] elloonious: I heard vanilla was all about world bosses. I think there should be more world bosses
[4:19:15] BlueBeast33: doesn't take that long if you know what you're doing
[4:19:30] applepae: 60 to 70 is amazing
[4:19:55] AshixBorden: Same every expansion
[4:19:58] DreavT2K: ppl wil stil be leveling
[4:20:09] DreavT2K: on vanilla world
[4:20:39] No_Panda: well Outland will be abandoned when Wotlk will be released, it's absolutely no problem
[4:20:54] elloonious: It's feeling like they got screwed because they dungeon leveled and the boosters "cheated"
[4:20:57] AshixBorden: What class are you going to boost?
[4:21:05] NickLeonhearth: @contentstarvedgamer lvl in vanilla for fun.... :D your name makes so much sense now
[4:21:05] Demorase: @contentstarvedgamer wrath had heirloom, made leveling alts fun
[4:21:12] neverbornlucky: Just got my stimulus check want a new graphic cards but can't tell myself to spend over 1,000 dollars on a graphic card
[4:21:26] Silentbawb99: bear tank its good
[4:21:40] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee People with #nochanges are living in some weird world and dont want to admit that with years things got better, and implementing some of that in the classic game is worth
[4:21:43] aeechtee: Did u test out prot warr after the patch? and if so, what do u think?
[4:21:55] No_Panda: also there were not a lot to do between raid tiers @contentstarvedgamer
[4:22:12] hurn_: @towelliee  the bots will exist with or without the 58 boosts. I never understood the “it will create more bots” argument.
[4:22:15] AshixBorden: Drops off the scarab boss guy
[4:22:23] Nevermolly: the tiara girl drops the second one
[4:22:33] elloonious: Prob just gonna make you kill everything to get the 2nd tab
[4:22:41] Dreija: Dreija subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! 5 years towHAMUP towGreen
[4:22:52] FluskB: True world buffs was so bad
[4:22:55] pukeeyyy: wbs are absoloute garbage
[4:23:05] Demorase: classic would have been better with #somechanges
[4:23:17] Demorase: fuck world buffs lol
[4:23:18] itsbananas01: Big true!
[4:23:21] foxies_havocing: that's why I always said that classic shit is waste of time and resources, just let them get over nostalgi
[4:23:26] foxies_havocing: nostalgia*
[4:23:36] Sarcastard: Sarcastard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! we have to stop meeting like this, people ae starting to talk
[4:23:42] FluskB: well it was just like 3 thing that was bad
[4:23:44] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Of course it failed, because people 16 years ago didnt know about things that they know now, and #nochanges doesnt work
[4:23:46] KrysKryngles: hey Towelie, best way to prepare for TBC?
[4:23:55] No_Panda: they can release vanilla the way it was, but they can't made ppl to be the way they were 15 years ago
[4:24:05] TemacTheSlayer: This shit should have went Classic+ instead of TBC - like an alternate timeline and completely new shit kinda like they did OSRS
[4:24:07] Demorase: classic is a great game regardless of nostalgia, but some aspects could use some changes
[4:24:07] elloonious: Not saying that's how I feel. I could care less if ppl boost
[4:24:16] Kyrrua: They should honestly make it so that you cannot gain xp in group with someone 10+ or level above you
[4:24:23] elloonious: Or Blizz gives em boosts
[4:24:29] Gizimoo86: 2007 world first BC French WoW player reaches level 70 in 28 hours
[4:24:46] No_Panda: @temactheslayer they are struggling to do 9.1 and you want them to do classic plus LUL
[4:24:56] itsbananas01: It was a warlock I think
[4:25:04] itsbananas01: Nymh or something
[4:25:10] TemacTheSlayer: @No_Panda I can dream. I don't even play wow anymore
[4:25:12] Kyrrua: dual spec would retain astronomically more players than no dual spec
[4:25:21] FluskB: That wand is so good
[4:25:28] No_Panda: Nyhm did cool machinimas
[4:25:35] Gizimoo86: yeah that BC world first "who reached level 70 with a mage class character called Gawell, told how he had help from 40 in-game friends working with him around the clock."
[4:25:57] Zomgboy: id love dual spec honestly, helps alot with questing and doing dungeons
[4:25:57] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:26:03] FluskB: i agree
[4:26:05] No_Panda: @temactheslayer dream wow is the best wow, we all have one SeemsGood
[4:26:11] Zomgboy: nah
[4:26:13] neverbornlucky: Nothing wrong with Group Finder if it matches right. I'd love to see them do classic cross realms arena to help with the population imbalance
[4:26:14] geokouts: dont save him
[4:26:16] Kyrrua: but ppl complain about hybrid spec dying or ppl only playing meta .. when it will be the case anyway and no one forces you to not play hybrid unless u are among 1% progress guilds
[4:26:19] Demorase: classic tuning is kind of a joke with world buffs
[4:26:23] Gizimoo86: So i think BC leveling is probably like one week if do 10 hour per day
[4:26:24] pukeeyyy: one of the few points i completely agreed with from mad was saying the fresh BC servers are a good idea for a lot of people that want a normal economy
[4:26:37] h_u_r_k_: FeelsBadMan
[4:26:42] geokouts: leave him, he was the guy who blew up the doors
[4:26:54] Demorase: @pukeeyyy it's a moot point, give it 2 months then econ would be in the same place

[4:26:56] Zansteh: drop the troll sweat, its worthless
[4:26:58] BlueBeast33: Yeah for most of us that are gonna play a lot 60-70 will take 2 or 3 days, which is why I brought up the 1-40 comparison since that takes around the same time
[4:27:05] Kyrrua: @pukeeyyy the best idea is to fight bots
[4:27:08] elloonious: True... There's alot of retail players that don't even know what boss mechanics are.
[4:27:23] Zomgboy: tank him under the door
[4:27:24] Dromgai: @Towelliee Whats the bag addon your using?
[4:27:29] Daeveren: !tbc
[4:27:29] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[4:27:51] PadidinJones: I said burn him!!
[4:27:57] 1godofwar0: you on the ancient egg quest chain?
[4:28:14] Zomgboy: @Towelliee tank him unde the door so you dont get this high into the air :)
[4:28:23] pukeeyyy: i think the argument is you would get non gold buyers playing on a fresh server so the economy wouldnt be as lopsided even though it obviously would creep in eventually
[4:28:39] TweakT: GG
[4:28:56] pukeeyyy: i dont have a strong opinion either way i love my char i wouldnt reroll
[4:29:02] bakaslayer1337: !TBC

[4:29:54] 1godofwar0: I'm just gonna play, ive never bots a boost cuz im poor lol
[4:29:56] einself111: at least for a while
[4:30:07] 1godofwar0: bought a boost
[4:30:08] TweakT: its easier to just reroll on a dead server
[4:30:13] No_Panda: there will be someone lvl 70 in 20 hours
[4:30:21] Kyrrua: wow tokens, dual spec, nerf boost 10+ lvl and maybe dungeon finder are needed right now for bc
[4:30:22] pukeeyyy: true i get ya, people gonna buy gold for mounts etc on fresh and pay crazy price
[4:30:24] TweakT: like the projects going on rn
[4:30:41] einself111: at least bots could not boost to lvl 58
[4:30:52] BlueBeast33: I gave up on fresh tbh, I already started leveling my priest on Herod
[4:31:13] TweakT: content homies
[4:31:30] einself111: players that did not play classic profit the most
[4:31:37] sprert: a proper group finder would be nice
[4:31:41] edanv: good evenin from AUS !
[4:31:55] MrGattz: tmog vender is a must
[4:31:56] Zabbuh: !tbc

[4:31:57] Kyrrua: I mean their dungeon thing, not the dungeon finder itself
[4:32:04] Demorase: dungeon finder that teleports you to dungeon with people from other servers you'll never see again is lame af
[4:32:10] No_Panda: we will have some addon for group finder I guess
[4:32:16] ILikeKillTheZombies: Will wow token price will be the same as on retail?
[4:32:23] Kyrrua: the dungeon search is what I meant, not dungeon finder ^^
[4:32:34] Maego1: the premade group thingy so you dont have to look at chat spam SeemsGood
[4:32:36] Genilort: still no bc beta wtf?
[4:32:38] beckett3a: hope they bring phasing back so 4hr queues wont be a thing again
[4:32:43] TweakT: instant char lvl boost is never good for the game
[4:32:50] Zabbuh: I get people that don't like it, but in my case, I got 5+ friends that will play just because of the boost. They just dont have time to level vanilla leveling and then start playing tbc
[4:32:53] elloonious: @Kyrrua depends on how many bots lol
[4:32:56] Zabbuh: so im happy with it
[4:32:58] Kyrrua: boost 58, dual spec, wow token, nerf boost 10+ lvl & dungeon search
[4:33:04] GabsTheBard_: i may play TBC just because boost will be available, dont wanna waste time leveling all the way again
[4:33:06] Genilort: wotlk was the very best though. but tbc is fun for pve and pvp players
[4:33:06] BlueBeast33: 15 heroics and 3 raids at the start plus arenas
[4:33:34] TweakT: 60 euro boost hf @SciGabs
[4:33:39] Oppsig1: Have they said anything about DUAL specc?
[4:34:12] einself111: So just give people fresh servers and every 1 is happy .... if people leave the overpopulated servers it is not bad that only means they need less layers lol
[4:34:17] No_Panda: @temsen same. I don't want to level 2 characters in vanilla, I'm getting a boost to 58 when it's available and meanwhile leveling main
[4:34:36] elloonious: @ILikeKillTheZombies depends on how many bots blizzard allows lol
[4:34:49] petroglyphs: !TBC
[4:34:49] Moobot: We want YOU for a WoW TBC raiding guild! Apply now! || http://towelliee.com/tbc || We will be choosing Azuresong Horde for our TBC server! Start leveling now! || Not playing Pally, no Blood Elfs yet || No TBC Launch date yet.
[4:34:49] TweakT: I cant imagine players that hate classic leveling enjoying bc
[4:34:55] Rothmar_: !tbc
[4:35:07] Genilort: tbc was also what made wow viral
[4:35:08] TweakT: KEKW
[4:35:19] TweakT: our opinion is different
[4:35:24] Daccotacco: rekt?
[4:35:28] durtyspritewow: will I have to sit in a 12k que again if i dc on launch is the question though
[4:35:30] Jawis: people crying about their "vanilla" experience not being forced on people that want tbc is just funny as hell
[4:35:30] Maego1: People expect players to play the game like they used to in 2004, cute :D
[4:35:31] Secondbreakfasttt: who cares
[4:35:34] Genilort: ye tbc is fine tuned a mix of vanilla and wotlk
[4:35:37] petroglyphs: LUL
[4:35:50] Kyrrua: Even tho I don't like it, without lvl 58 boost, you lose 50% of players, it was a given they would do it
[4:35:51] TweakT: we don't care that you dont care :)
[4:36:03] No_Panda: ye, as a bc and wow nostalgic person I don't get why this vanilla fans have to be listened to
[4:36:07] Jawis: and we dont care what you care about :)
[4:36:13] Rothmar_: !TBC

[4:36:29] jkitchin75: @TweakT we all dont care that you dont care
[4:36:29] raymond3195: classic andys the muppet brigade
[4:36:31] Secondbreakfasttt: why are you even talkng about then
[4:36:33] VikingSesh: @Towelliee are you prepping for TBC?
[4:36:37] 1godofwar0: my stance generally is post everything LUL
[4:36:41] petroglyphs: I was a cataclysm baby so I dont really care what happens LUL
[4:36:46] TweakT: see? nobody cares @jkitchin75
[4:36:48] Genilort: to be honest tbc had the coolest gear and stuff.
[4:36:51] Demorase: ye it's fair, some people only care about tbc and not classic and they dont care for leveling thru classic just for tbc
[4:37:21] MrGattz: why does nobody care that we need a tmog vender? we need a tmog system in bc
[4:37:26] durtyspritewow: will I have to sit in a 12k que again if i dc on launch like classic is the question though
[4:37:40] gorilla_quantistico: so unique reps
[4:37:42] Jawis: The Burning Shadowlands PogChamp
[4:37:43] sprert: tbc is a balanced classic with stuff to do
[4:37:50] elloonious: @Demorase Good point
[4:37:54] Secondbreakfasttt: there is no true classic, people buying mage boost and tallking about true classic exp jesus
[4:37:57] Kerminal: man im pretty lost.. what do i even prep for.. I just hit level 60 on a warrior
[4:37:59] Gizimoo86: yeah its nice mix
[4:38:03] Mike__Ro: ''You recieved a Haala battle token''
[4:38:07] No_Panda: @durtyspritewow if you are on less populated server
[4:38:09] TweakT: thats what happened in actual tbc
[4:38:11] TweakT: nobody cared
[4:38:18] MVRD: gz
[4:38:21] FluskB: GZ
[4:38:22] MVRD: PogChamp
[4:38:34] Steelsound: Will boosting through classic leveling be available?
[4:38:37] Mezukage: Aisle Dailies were on another level of world quest(island) experience. especially on pvp servers
[4:38:44] einself111: yeah but telling people that want fresh they can't have it is like the same thing just let us choose
[4:38:50] elloonious: Yah like I said, I lvl'd to 38 in classic and was like... fuck this

[4:39:02] Inapropreate: in hinterlands
[4:39:04] Genilort: how long does it even take from 60-70 dont remember
[4:39:14] Streamcrush: the irony of complaining about level boosts when paying to have your character boosted through dungeons is considered normal on Classic
[4:39:23] Demorase: @TinyTank it's 800g if you're honored with city and have r3 pvp
[4:39:33] No_Panda: @tinytank level your professions (there's a lot of YT wideos on what to prep for bc. also get gold as much as you can)
[4:39:40] NewWorldReign: You guys remember being ganked in this area, even if you're in the goblin place?
[4:39:43] BlueBeast33: @TinyTank epic mount price goes down in pre-patch I think so I'd just wait
[4:39:45] TweakT: not everybody pays for dungeon boosts, people like me enjoy leveling @StreamCrush

[4:39:57] Mezukage: True

[4:40:16] Jawis: so you don't want Blizzard to "force" stuf fon you, but the other way around it's good? I don't get it TweakT
[4:40:19] blozham: @TweakT same, literally never boosted
[4:40:24] Dennisaurus_Rex: yeah im looking at pve servers now, trying to figure out which one to transfer to come tbc
[4:40:25] Streamcrush: sure, but you're probably not part of the group complaining on the forums @TweakT
[4:40:47] TweakT: @StreamCrush I am complaining about the 58 boost
[4:40:52] TweakT: but nobody cares KEKW
[4:40:57] Silentbawb99: zangarmarsh XD
