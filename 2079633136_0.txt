[2:51:58] Elijahss: Except the alts
[2:52:07] Aidstation: I think that is very true and a lot of group aren't prepared to jump to 20 mans like that
[2:52:20] Elijahss: Yeah an alt cannot help fill 20 mans
[2:52:50] Renfuryy: they were fine last week, but this week they had to reschedule and then had too many pugs
[2:53:45] Renfuryy: I think if the group was mostly guildies (as it was before) it would be fine, just unfortunate scheduling

[2:57:42] Renfuryy: not sure why its like that, and not sure when it was changed, it sucks though, especially as disc I can't really help you without being in group
