[3:43:41] tylive52: Hardcore subathon
[3:43:46] Sarocus: Season 1 starts on June 20
[3:43:47] VixxixTV: its about a month or less than a month , they talked about this
[3:43:51] TheUnknowing: Id assume the first season would need to happen fairly quickly, but idk.
[3:44:14] Samthedamn: @ackdogg007 that would be very good and optimistic, since i think they will use pre-season to class balance and fix everything
[3:44:29] MickeyMacburns: Each class has a Fraction were you can become Exalted and become a talent from another class.
[3:44:36] Samthedamn: but they said they will give more infos on that on thier next stream
[3:44:41] Noshpan: Bless you
[3:44:52] donjana1: if u think about it the release without season is like first season tbh
[3:44:57] tylive52: I have to give my hats off to the addon devs/community they appealed everything so quick
[3:44:59] ryanc1124: top of the morning lads
[3:45:02] Sarocus: Season 1 starts on June 20 towClap
[3:45:07] vimie: hope D4 is a good time
[3:45:16] VixxixTV: Towelliee are you gonna play the D4 weekend may 12-14?
[3:45:24] mavericks312: It almost feels like Diablo is releasing content in the WoW format
[3:45:26] EKS90_: google say june 20th or september 8th. so who knows
[3:45:27] donjana1: id rather play a little bit no season so they can sort out the end game for the first season
[3:45:39] MickeyMacburns: Before you can do this you have to be Exaled in your own class Fraction
[3:46:13] AtmoTake: Zelda comes out on the 12th of May :D
[3:46:15] MickeyMacburns: Similar to City reputation
[3:46:25] MickeyMacburns: For mounts
[3:46:34] PotbellyGoat: terrible for Mother's day lol
[3:46:38] tylive52: Still some of the best game music of all time <3
[3:46:44] ackdogg007: They are going to have to do class turning and if you look at the landscape of how the D3 seasons work they typically do a 2 to 3 week ptr then adjust from there and that would already put it past the 20th
[3:46:50] Daarksyde: and it's Mother's Day weekend who are celebrating for those so it's odd weekend
[3:46:50] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[3:46:55] Exodeo_: Echo breaks to play D4 to give Liquid a chance Kappa
[3:47:14] Bawpears: That's messed up. lol
[3:47:18] EKS90_: i only raid wednesday and sunday so thats ok for me atleast my computer was not working properly last test. looking forward to this one
[3:47:24] NickLeonhearth: Liquid, whos that Kappa ?
[3:47:24] mavericks312: That Zelda game is gonna be generational
[3:47:49] mavericks312: Let’s be fair echo had a little help from the devs
[3:47:53] iamanerd: Yeah I wouldn’t want to miss Zelda I’ll skip d4 beta
[3:47:54] Exodeo_: What's this sleep you speak of? ;p
[3:48:00] jerseyfive: if blizzard tunes the bosses easy liquid can win
[3:48:08] NickLeonhearth: Liquid are all "dried" up....
[3:48:08] firewalltwitch: a little means a lot
[3:48:15] falldrgn: They both had help.. (echo and limit)
[3:48:27] falldrgn: there were nerfs when both were alseep
[3:48:42] donjana1: its still kinda dumb that blizz are not able to release at the same time for everyone
[3:48:45] LearnedSomething: a fortunate turn of events
[3:48:46] mavericks312: Nah bro releasing that morning fix was equal to the bullshit holding call in the super bowl
[3:48:50] illyasfox_inkling: When is the  next raid coming out
[3:48:51] Nerendis: But they started a day behind
[3:48:52] bugcatcher19: was it eu friendly
[3:48:54] abracka_: ah shit, now we're gonna have a naowh react
[3:49:36] Lokkyy: what headset do you use?
[3:49:37] falldrgn: Echo adjusted their schedule for NA incase this happened. It was well played. Echo just wanted it more.
[3:49:47] Exodeo_: I'd love for an outsider to win for once though to make the race more interesting again
[3:49:55] Lokkyy: ty
[3:50:15] illyasfox_inkling: I love Echo ❤️
[3:50:21] Nerendis: Echo can also pull nearly 2x as mich
[3:50:23] nilachip: Echo is a different beast
[3:50:34] MickeyMacburns: Liquid would have won they fixed the Boss fight and Echo got lucky
[3:50:34] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[3:50:48] Drizzy_Ds: i know this will start a fight, but i do believe starting a day later also has its advantage because first team in are the extra bug testers , not saying its all pros but they have some
[3:51:03] procyon_mfc: you can get heavy linen now
[3:51:08] Lupine_Fury: 40 then 80 for wool
[3:51:08] Mozzeyy_: @mickeymacburns COPIUM
[3:51:20] ArcaneSyntax: Number of pulls is kinda worthless.
[3:51:22] firewalltwitch: liquid didnt vs the nerf version of the boss though
[3:51:23] Nerendis: No I realize they are cleaner. I just mean historically we have seen them ducking grind it out.
[3:51:24] Zeke_nl: @MickeyMacburns LUL
[3:51:25] procyon_mfc: no FA here - have to go to IF
[3:51:44] mavericks312: But liquid also bug tests and gives echo a base strategy

[3:52:12] firewalltwitch: liquid beta tests for Echo
[3:53:05] MickeyMacburns: Blizz fixed the boss as Echo was raiding so everyone could relax and enjoy Christmas Holidays .
[3:53:06] ArcaneSyntax: Every race is like liquid spending half a day on a boss before it's nerfed and echo beats in half the time.
[3:53:16] falldrgn: Echo is just better, echo and Method (in its prime) have proven that the US advantage doesn't matter
[3:53:27] illyasfox_inkling: But stream  is fun to watch
[3:53:39] nilachip: get Blizz to open the raid at the same time worldwide
[3:53:41] LearnedSomething: exploitation is kind of a loaded term
[3:53:58] LearnedSomething: they definitely enjoy a lot of support
[3:54:27] firewalltwitch: i never think the viewership will get that low lol
[3:54:27] Nerendis: I think going back to not steaming is likely. Esports orgs are hemorrhaging.
[3:54:31] ArcaneSyntax: In terms of helpers NA is at a significant disadvantage
[3:54:44] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  i mean the same team winning the RWF all the time hurts the viewings
[3:54:46] JQ47: Hard to see it when echo is it's own company
[3:55:00] NickLeonhearth: I can't imagine ppl actually caring about WoW race to world first...even if you watch it, theres so much going on you dont understand shit, it's not like the MDI where you just watch 5 ppl
[3:55:09] LearnedSomething: oh ok, exploitation of the system, not the community :)
[3:55:43] ArcaneSyntax: It's an arms race and both guilds do it.
[3:55:55] procyon_mfc: yep
[3:55:55] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!

[3:56:00] mavericks312: @nickleonhearth if anyone has raided in wow before it’s pretty simple to no what’s going on
[3:56:02] Rottencoarse: you have to have on you
[3:56:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yes, mining pick in bag
[3:56:31] mavericks312: And also they have the bigger bags as well
[3:56:44] NickLeonhearth: @mavericks312 no, because I am a mythic raider, and i can follow, but i have a lot of friends who don't understand what they are seeing at all
[3:56:57] MickeyMacburns: They all have like 10 boosted chars that farm gear for one player
[3:57:13] nilachip: both had the same ivl no, so I dont see the advantage

[3:57:43] Wulfgrym: good morning all
[3:57:57] ArcaneSyntax: Actually I think bdg probably hurts Liquid more other EU guilds hurt echo.
[3:58:17] MickeyMacburns: In the second week they had all 4 set bonus^^
[3:58:18] DecayedmiNt: Hurt in what way?
[3:58:21] ArcaneSyntax: And Liquid absolutely hurts bdg
[3:58:32] FutileDiploma: The strategy is the content now
[3:58:32] Ertra: !hc
[3:58:35] soundpraenk: i have like 415ilvl char on retail, is it enough for new season start or it's better to go farm more?

[3:58:44] ArcaneSyntax: Number of resources available
[3:58:55] MickeyMacburns: Bdg has a massive boosting comunity
[3:59:17] MickeyMacburns: And Echo had there support
[3:59:28] falldrgn: at a certain point it just comes down to resources.
[4:00:06] MickeyMacburns: They been talking about deleting Echo and next time its Bgd team
[4:00:06] ArcaneSyntax: Like the NA community is smaller, having two top 10 guilds is stretching those resources thin.
[4:00:36] nilachip: the mighty Preach being paid
[4:00:39] LearnedSomething: chef, coaches, cleaning lady
[4:00:43] falldrgn: It makes me wonder how much those dudes get paid.. it can't be enough to make a living.
[4:01:05] the_general01: source: trust me bro
[4:01:05] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[4:01:09] LearnedSomething: acoustic foam?
[4:01:12] TheUnknowing: deleting echo and replacing bdg with em, sure.
[4:01:19] MickeyMacburns: Bgd wanted to buy the Echo name
[4:01:37] MickeyMacburns: Take over
[4:01:40] Thunder4o: Race to World First is nothing like before,its not on the skill of the players,money matters more than anything
[4:01:49] mavericks312: If your not a big spender that money can last awhile
[4:01:56] Wulfgrym: 4.75 plus coffee breaks and full paid lunch LUL
[4:02:02] falldrgn: @Thunder4o Imean.. it still takes skiill to do what they do..
[4:02:10] nilachip: skill matters, they top two have the ilvl when reaching the end boss
[4:02:17] MickeyMacburns: Bgd have Chinese investors
[4:02:48] MickeyMacburns: Its from boosting they make so much
[4:02:48] mavericks312: China number 1 lol
[4:02:50] Thunder4o: @falldrgn all top 10-15-20 guilds over the world are around the same skill level,but not a single guild can come close to Echo and Liquid just because of the money
[4:02:54] cabalish: towHi  morning all THS towLove towComfy

[4:03:59] Epicsapphire1988: chill

[4:05:10] cabalish: its basically hard fucking work + all the rest
[4:05:13] Nerendis: In small esports it’s not uncommon for 2-3 teams to be unbelievably higher than the rest.
[4:05:15] MickeyMacburns: I test all boosting platforms so that New games can auto block with Geo software
[4:05:43] Thunder4o: I bet number 1 and 2 wont have such a gap between them and 3-10 if not for money
[4:05:51] cabalish: its the same in sports
[4:06:09] Storm_Taker: Morning everyone
[4:06:23] Nerendis: “I bet the pats wouldn’t be as good without money” wtf?
[4:06:23] Bawpears: I think the skill was there prior to the money
[4:06:29] Thunder4o: Would of been alot better this world
[4:06:30] spektyr25: h4x0r25 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months!

[4:06:47] MickeyMacburns: Esports is basically 5-7 years of prine skill time.
[4:07:00] Aidler: And skill is ultimately where the money is
[4:07:01] Thunder4o: Ye we wanna see this,only skill to matter
[4:07:13] mavericks312: Imagine asking mike trout to play for free
[4:07:13] falldrgn: but echo and Limit also have players they can cycle in that would best players in other guilds by far.. and the top 5 can make that time commitment
[4:07:24] Cello_73: Streaming WF is a double edge sword. Cool to see, but it totally changed the race as well
[4:08:00] vimie: back in the day I just remember YT vids of the kills, they didnt stream it then?
[4:08:08] Cello_73: lol
[4:08:14] TompsonX: Cringe
[4:08:17] falldrgn: it allowed for a deeper look into the race. more insight from commentors who know what they are talking about and access to the raiders.
[4:08:26] falldrgn: and more $$ for charity
[4:08:37] DecayedmiNt: Could also stream with a delay
[4:08:49] lucid_wow: @vimie nah they would just record their kill and usually after around 5 or so kills in the world they would upload the kill vid
[4:08:50] LearnedSomething: plenty of ad space that way
[4:08:53] MickeyMacburns: Most E sport teams have players you can swap and no one notices the difference rarely you have players who shine and are irreplaceble
[4:09:26] DecayedmiNt: Paragon and Exorsus videos FeelsBadMan
[4:09:32] WoW_StandalonE: Cartel agreement
[4:09:53] MickeyMacburns: Imagine having a Zero Addon World First Race.

[4:11:06] MickeyMacburns: But i just wanna play i am pasted my gamer prime time.
[4:11:06] TheUnknowing: If it gets to the point where echo is just always winning, that would be pretty boring. I mean its almost at that point but
[4:11:18] marineboi1288: uh oh make sure u stay away from the troggs this time  lol
[4:11:21] Bawpears: I mean I've already kinda lost interest in it because its literally the same every time.
[4:11:39] TompsonX: It's okay to have the same team win as long as it's close imo

[4:11:40] vimie: race to world 2nd
[4:11:56] Thunder4o: It will be so good for everyone,even for Echo if some1 out of top 2 win RWF
[4:11:58] lucid_wow: honestly i kinda do see that happening, its like u said earlier 1 and 2 are better than 3-10 but 1 is still better than 2
[4:12:07] captivate7: losing Naowh to the rwf is rough too, he's a great tank to watch
[4:12:12] TheUnknowing: Its definitely weird when watching world like 3-4th is more interesting than watching world 1st and 2nd

[4:12:58] gassylammas: It’s beautiful that I can still wake up to towelliee 10 years later.
[4:13:02] Aidler: NA needs more EU players to win the race… kek
[4:13:07] Bawpears: I mean there is a facet to watch to see if EU loses.
[4:13:10] DecayedmiNt: if NA wins its because the headstart haHAA
[4:13:14] Vampirslayer: tbh i watch the race more for the hosts chat than the race itself
[4:13:15] falldrgn: they have some challengers in the MDI.. its not a walk in the park for echo at the MDI
[4:13:17] lucid_wow: crazy how echo as an org has the best rwf team the best mdi team and the best eu awc team
[4:13:42] MickeyMacburns: Its like football champions leauge ine tean has more money and buy all best player pool seat them on the bench an then know they are unbeatable.

[4:21:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: Reworking the affixes is awesome
[4:21:03] ClassicMalcontent: Good. I hope remains as such. As I like playing more than WoW.
[4:21:13] firewalltwitch: why is it going to be good for casuals? easy dungeons?
[4:21:32] Aidler: @thunder4o but on paper the best players…. just no team. I agree, you are spot on

[4:22:27] FoxPixels: Im super excited! I havent been playing wow for a while but this has brought me back
[4:22:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: The IO scores can get screwed by other people, I like not needing those
[4:23:09] MickeyMacburns: I find the extreme upgearing pauses is a big disadvantage for small teams who have to work. Better would be Pro Gamer and Amateuer Gamer World First.

[4:24:44] FioteBearDev: ops, 14
[4:24:47] Rilix: I dont like that i cant farm small keys to get an important item and then just upgrade it to prevent bad luck example playing unholy without a puzzlebox is laughable. I had to run low level academy's upwards of 80 times before i finally got one. and that wouldnt have been possible for me to do that many in appropriate level keys
[4:24:51] Jewishraver: Jewishraver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Thanks for all the entertainment man!

[4:26:14] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah you need to be bent friends with the guild leader to be invited to the guild now
[4:26:20] captivate7: will they continue to make updates to it you think?
[4:26:37] Scarhearth: concescrate is still pretty great
[4:26:38] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  start going ret tree imo
[4:26:43] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee benediction is better
[4:26:47] Rottencoarse: u dont need consec as retri
[4:26:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think consecrate is kind of a waste of mana
[4:26:49] procyon_mfc: we need island trogg revenge
[4:26:49] dimofodi: @captivate7 I think they'll absolutely keep working on cross-faction but it's going to take a lot of time.
[4:26:53] maventar: go ret tree to get seal of command
[4:27:01] ArcaneSyntax: Consecrate is totally not worth it outside of tanking
[4:27:03] coldarmorTBG: shoulda prolly started with benediction

[4:34:00] HonestPhilosophy: sketchy at 15 for sure
[4:34:01] Scarhearth: Ive had many overconfidence close calls had a 1 hp escape yesterday
[4:34:06] misshotmore: What addons are allowed in the Hardcore mode?
[4:34:13] ClassicMalcontent: Besides Hogger, Princess, Goldtooth... oh but you meant in Dun Morogh
[4:34:19] Rilix: two people dead there
[4:34:48] Piebringer619: Caves = BIG DANGER
[4:34:58] FioteBearDev: geomancers, the bane of HC
[4:35:11] ClassicMalcontent: Caves are Bad MKAY
[4:35:16] Sidnor: it's the hyperspawns
[4:35:21] Sidnor: 4 mobs spawned on me in this cave
[4:35:21] Jewishraver: are we taking candles?
[4:35:42] raymond3195: Ugo crater caves not nice
[4:36:21] Gengisman: @raymond3195 they are a  total mess! :P
[4:36:22] ArcaneSyntax: I think just being a paladin means you don't die
[4:36:30] MickeyMacburns: A Horde player kited an elite into the cave and stun locked it till a poor little HC player enters
[4:36:55] Piebringer619: i cant see how hunter can die
[4:37:03] Rilix: when in doubt: bubblehearth out
[4:37:06] Piebringer619: they are range while pet tank
[4:37:23] Brodih_: HC is fun because every small upgrade you get feels amazing
[4:37:26] ArcaneSyntax: It also helps that paladin has basically a shield with devo so you can still 2h
[4:37:28] raymond3195: Lay on hands means no mana as well
[4:37:32] MickeyMacburns: Hunters have the highest dearh rate from all chars
[4:37:48] FioteBearDev: @MickeyMacburns probably overconfident
[4:37:52] WoW_StandalonE: Lay on hands drain all your mana tho
[4:37:58] HonestPhilosophy: @Brodih_ I was saying yesterday a green upgrade feels like a bis raid drop
[4:38:03] Gengisman: @MickeyMacburns that cant be right
[4:38:06] desmo7: can shamans reincarnate?
[4:38:17] buodild: @MickeyMacburns pet pathing will pull so much extra on its own lol
[4:38:23] MickeyMacburns: Play Dead resist^^
[4:38:27] Brodih_: @HonestPhilosophy lol yeah it must feel like it
[4:38:34] HonestPhilosophy: i didnt even buy soulstone
[4:38:37] ArcaneSyntax: Paladins also have significantly stronger healing spells that like shaman do at earlier levels
[4:38:37] instant_savage: can u explain why bubble hearth is not allowed
[4:38:44] instant_savage: like whats the reason behind that
[4:38:45] desmo7: does feign death count as a death Kappa
[4:38:47] goldenharpbilly: Did the Warrior die?
[4:38:51] FioteBearDev: @MickeyMacburns yeah that also. gotta dismiss them like all the time lol
[4:38:52] dreamwalker213: I think a lot of hunters are overconfident and realize that a majority of the time pets can’t hold aggro worth shit and they freak out
[4:38:59] raymond3195: Warrior only good when they get whirlwind weapon
[4:39:09] FioteBearDev: @goldenharp_billy !warrior
[4:39:23] FioteBearDev: @goldenharp_billy or !death1 now i guess
[4:39:25] Bayne77: towelliee is just here so he doesnt get fined
[4:39:26] instant_savage: yeah but with ank and ss u actually die and come back, bubble ur just taking advatage of ur abilties and gear
[4:39:26] Piebringer619: no more coolest class warrior :(
[4:39:31] MickeyMacburns: Paladin is the best healer in classic with the right gear.
[4:39:32] n0tl0wHS: LOL fuck em
[4:39:36] Gengisman: @raymond3195 at what level do you get that as a warr?

[4:39:37] Nerendis: You can use petrify + hearth. Bubble hearth isn’t allowed because it’s not available to everyone, same with SS or Anhk @towelliee
[4:39:41] Zedowel: my friend died just from another paladins bubble
[4:39:44] instant_savage: u would die anyway cause if one gro member dies u all delete
[4:39:54] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[4:40:09] jkitchin75: its in your spell book

[4:40:19] PhillyRhino: Bubble-hearth should be a pvp talent only :-P
[4:40:21] Experiia: @instant_savage Dungeon groups don't work like that just duos or trios
[4:40:25] HonestPhilosophy: no its not lol
[4:40:25] Lintgamer: What if you die in dungeon as tank and other 4 people die also do they also need to delete?
[4:40:34] instant_savage: oh
[4:40:39] Nerendis: @instant_savage lol no. That’s only for duo - trio. 1-60. Not for dungeon groups.
[4:40:39] ShinerG: How were the pyramids built?
[4:40:48] dreamwalker213: @lintgamer die = delete

[5:01:46] Narodigg: So its like leftover lol
[5:01:52] Narodigg: loeftovers*
[5:01:54] Aquadriel: @Latarielle it does taste good, they are fresh and come with an ice packet to keep em fresh. Most meals i tried were good, a couple were meh but that might be cause i am a picky eater but over all was good stuff.
[5:01:56] ShinerG: Frozen is actually healthy. Look it up chat. Think of transportation and flash freezing meat and veggies/fruits is a GOOD THING. Protects against everything when frozen
[5:01:59] Sollice: Banquet FTW
[5:02:01] SmallzzIV: That brownie tho...

[5:03:21] Nerendis: I usually go to darkshore at this point @towelliee - but the run may not be worth it on HC
[5:03:21] KaisenSiru: Lunchables Pog
[5:03:23] DJDitra: the old kid cuisines were next level ghetto. The worst was the brownie and trying to eat it before it got too cold and hard.
[5:03:24] MickeyMacburns: Just explore area for xp
[5:03:34] CompSciJedi: I loved Factor's meals when I was using them, my only issue was the cost once my budget changed. Super tasty, easy to keep keto, and very easy to make
[5:03:34] colonelkashmir: Salisbury steak from banquet is besto
[5:03:38] n0tl0wHS: it was like 10 bucks
[5:03:38] Sarocus: 10 bucks for NC
[5:03:39] heatedblankit: It is all relative. Cost works out for me with time etc. ~10$ a meal is not expensive to all.
[5:03:44] heatedblankit: 10$

[5:06:00] portend: Thoguh also depends on the place you're ordering from. You're almost paying the same price for delivery as you are the meal.
[5:06:13] pacificrimme69: Yea they've been doing that all week. Ally taking guards to moonbrook, which autoflag people for pvp then 60 horde kill everyone

[5:13:34] Strke1: Good general rule of thumb for HC levelling is stay away from a lot of the middle zones of eastern kingdoms as much as possible

[5:30:07] CeruleanStar: it's my #1 played class and i haven't played it since legion :(
[5:30:08] FioteBearDev: is the addon filtering only alliance? or i assume this is a alliance server so mostly HCers are that
[5:30:12] TLew02: Im branching out and trying a healer in 10.1. Always mained a tank lol
[5:30:23] coldarmorTBG: I start my heal at 1oo hp xD not dying to some bs crit

[5:36:03] MickeyMacburns: Just Backpack only
[5:36:20] PvtHudson093: I got KSM pre ret rework
[5:36:22] NexxusWoW: Imo retail is not suited for HC because it will mostly revolve around grouped content
[5:36:35] FioteBearDev: @kvnxvo the fact that the the whole dragon isles have roads to mostly every place is actually badass, even if we don't use them

[5:46:21] CeruleanStar: oooo nice tank+4dps
[5:46:25] CeruleanStar: could probably do it faster lol
[5:46:32] CeruleanStar: just take a devoker
[5:46:34] MickeyMacburns: The trick is to multi profesion skill collect plants an Ore to 150 then change to skining and smithing
[5:46:37] Zijkrial: no healer or prot pally*
[5:46:39] potnudel: Cant you trade with you other HC alt ?

[5:48:50] FioteBearDev: @toyhutt draenei ... what? isnt HC on classic era servers?
[5:49:06] Lawbelisk: Chat does anyone know if the addon recognise whether someone traded or broke the rules ? If so that would be badass
[5:49:39] Aravarth: @Lawbelisk It does
[5:49:42] toyhutt: No Draenei for HC?  Didn't know...anyone confirm?
[5:49:44] FioteBearDev: lol the barrens
[5:50:09] emznev: LUL
[5:50:12] Aravarth: There's a Verification tab where it says if you failed the challenge, and it will trigger on trading, using your mailbox, or dying
[5:50:43] MickeyMacburns: If you do it before you load the addon no but as soon as the addon is active and your char has qualified to play yes.
[5:50:49] Lawbelisk: @Aravarth Oh really? That is awesome, now I am considering playing it.

[5:54:06] r0b928: Half my paycheck goes to Costco
[5:54:16] MickeyMacburns: I tested all. But have a real HC char. In game with out boosts but some times their is a lvl 60 mage that does aoe cloth farming as i have like 10% HP^^
[5:54:18] Lawbelisk: I'll probably wait for an official HC release
[5:54:21] legionxdix: Can you do the harcore in WotLK classic?
[5:54:50] Sleepylol93: But wrath is too easy
[5:55:00] MickeyMacburns: Yes tbc and change to Deathknight at 55
[5:55:16] jasperboy: Hardcore wrath would be the same. No trading, no grouping, no heirlooms etc etc.. but ofc, it would be 982734 times easier
[5:55:28] Asreyya: nothing is hard on wrath lol

[5:56:29] FioteBearDev: @Spiffypal towel is playing on Bloodsail Buccaneer
[5:56:40] shadow2step: highest ive gotten is 23 and got F'd in dm lol
[5:56:46] Ponickz: everyone thinks there class is the hardest
[5:57:25] MickeyMacburns: Mage is the easiest ever char to do this achieve.
[5:57:41] Zijkrial: hardcore rules in dungeons seems super rough. Going with 2 healers doesn't sound crazy to me lol.
[5:57:51] Asreyya: I'll go easy route and do a druid

[5:58:29] r0b928: Over 9000
[5:58:35] desmo7: wht are the HC rules in dungeons?
[5:58:38] adxx: im on a druid. kinda slow like warrior until level 20. after that its pretty smooth sailing
[5:58:39] xchaoskingsx: I think any class hitting 60 in HC is an achievement
[5:58:39] mooseon: was your first HC character to 60 warr?
[5:58:57] ObsidianHealer: At least 2 ayuuNodders
[5:58:58] xchaoskingsx: Its not like making a mage = instant 60
[5:59:02] aingard: Yeah, warrior without AH and trading is super rough. What classes are best for it (easiest) - mage, hunter?
[5:59:26] dreamwalker213: Lock, mage, hunter
[5:59:30] Aravarth: pet classes
[5:59:32] Experiia: Hunter has the most deaths
[5:59:32] Zijkrial: 95% of my classic deaths are to mobs patrolling. I don't think i'd enjoy hardcore LUL
[5:59:32] dracer30: All classes are hard to get to 60, some might be harder, but ive died plenty of times because of respawns lol
[5:59:34] MickeyMacburns: My Dicsi priest was first to do it back in the day
[5:59:37] bugcatcher19: rogue is slow
[5:59:48] Nerendis: Paladin and Druid are super easy
[5:59:53] mooseon: id only want a paladin or warlock for the free mount
[5:59:55] dreamwalker213: Once you get drain tank build for lock you’re basically unkillable if you don’t do dumb shit
[5:59:57] doublemeatpalace: Rogue is one of the easier ones too
[5:59:58] saveslol: Paladin has been easiest for me so far. Slow and steady, but lots of outs for death.
[6:00:07] MickeyMacburns: Disci priest is a paladin with Fear^^
[6:00:10] Ponickz: so 8 classes 7 ez got it
[6:00:10] adxx: druid is slowish. 1-10 is like playing a priest, and 10-20 is like playing a warrior but with only 1 ability lol
[6:00:20] adxx: after 20 tho, it picks up and is quite easy to solo harder quests
[6:00:31] Aravarth: That pig doesn't fuck around
[6:00:31] ObsidianHealer: I've not seen to many people do this challenge as Horde. Is it mainly Alliance? @towelliee
[6:00:31] Ponickz: wait mages are OP must be trash
[6:00:37] MickeyMacburns: You kill everthing with your Wand
[6:00:40] GabrielKD: imagine going to the princess at level 9 :(
[6:00:42] aingard: @MickeyMacburns lvling with wand? :D
[6:00:54] Ponickz: @MickeyMacburns WHAT?
[6:00:57] mooseon: i feel like paladin has a nice cushion too because of their protection aura
[6:00:58] Asreyya: yeah once you get cat form its better
[6:01:05] aingard: yeah, I expected that, haha
[6:01:08] dreamwalker213: @obsidianhealer there are horde but alliance is more popular

[6:01:49] dreamwalker213: @eviltuna13 no
[6:01:57] colonelkashmir: @eviltuna13 no
[6:01:58] Foretoldlegends: @Eviltuna13 No. You both have to log in at the same time.
[6:02:06] Eviltuna13: Ok
[6:02:08] MickeyMacburns: In Classic Disci Priest is the better Paladin^^
[6:02:12] Aravarth: respawn timers in those caves in Elwynn are no joke
[6:02:22] shadow2step: i refuse to go to westfall
[6:02:27] Ponickz: @aingard thought he said mage sorry
[6:02:54] aingard: @Eviltuna13 it is like multiboxing, you must be with each other all the time (excl druid q)
[6:03:01] not_pr0: why no druids
[6:03:01] shadow2step: that fucking place is scary in this mode lol
[6:03:09] ObsidianHealer: I have was thinkin of trying the challenge as Horde but if it's mostly Alliance I feel like I shouldnt.
[6:03:34] Ponickz: @ObsidianHealer theres alot on both sides
[6:03:41] gibby23: Are bear tanks any good in classic?
[6:04:11] Zijkrial: i wouldn't dungeon LUL
[6:04:11] CeruleanStar: wars are pretty much the only 'good' tank.. and even then it all depends on your group
[6:04:12] MickeyMacburns: Just go to hord start area and loot all the treasure chests Boe blue gear up
[6:04:14] KrakonSkullz: Can anyone play the HC challenge?
[6:04:17] Snappole_: brd and lbrs is risky haha
[6:04:17] Jango_: @gibby23 they are ok
[6:04:22] EpicJune: kill boars Southpark style LUL
[6:04:23] MoldyBaby: No, you’re relying on the healer to not waste all of that time you invested
[6:04:25] CeruleanStar: tanking in classic is more about aggro control than anythign else
[6:04:26] aingard: I would be scared to do any dg at 50... too much risk!
[6:04:31] mooseon: plaguelands more dangerous than the dungeons imo

[6:05:16] mozavich: @MoldyBaby as a healer, i digress. i'd hate to waste my time when the tank/dps can't control their aggro and just die
[6:05:17] MickeyMacburns: I do deadmines at lvl 40 solo^^^
[6:05:19] hextosis: Remind me again, can you only run a dungeon once on a HC char?
[6:05:32] mozavich: @hextosis one time
[6:05:32] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[6:05:35] dreamwalker213: @hextosis yep
[6:05:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Is that like the running of the gnomes?
[6:05:47] cptncadillac: “The way is shut. It was made by those who are Dead, and the Dead keep it, until the time comes. The way is shut.”

[6:06:13] dreamwalker213: Fastest group to level up and finish deadmines without dying
[6:06:17] samsara1989: race to deadmines is an event where you start fresh and level asap to do deadmines with a group, HC mode ofcourse.
[6:06:19] Experiia: It's ran by the Hardcore addon people
[6:06:37] MickeyMacburns: So have a super weekend all leaving work right now be live soon when i get Home
[6:06:39] MoldyBaby: @mozavich well of course you have a bias opinion and that’s okay. But, not all healers are the same either..lol don’t want to die because they’re not paying attention for a split second.
[6:06:46] CeruleanStar: i'll group for that if you do it today?
[6:06:47] SmallzzIV: you have 6 hours
[6:06:49] SmallzzIV: to lvl
[6:06:56] Nerendis: You have a set time to level up. After the set time there is a random group draft. Then it’s best time like m+ @towelliee
[6:07:03] desti_gaming: DM at 15 its risky, VanCLeef and stuff are lvl 22+
[6:07:11] adxx: And Vancleef fight is sketchy at level 15 lol
[6:07:29] adxx: Vancleef spawning 4 adds is the scary part. all level 20-21
[6:07:30] aingard: dm at 15 @Towelliee - you would need some good healing
[6:07:32] MickeyMacburns: Mind Control us badass
[6:07:52] Nerendis: Can anyone participate in the race to DM btw? Is there like a discord sign up?
[6:08:02] MickeyMacburns: All dead
[6:08:03] HalfLeif: Go agane
[6:08:04] samsara1989: no solo leveling, theres a draft after the leveling phase is over
[6:08:04] StraightErro: @Towelliee be on during the race so you can watch the spam of death notifications
[6:08:06] SmallzzIV: level on your own and then it's a draft
[6:08:08] PokerFaceMoose: in duos or trios if one dies, all die
[6:08:08] Ponickz: go in handicapped
[6:08:14] Nerendis: You level solo and get drafted into a group
[6:08:22] MickeyMacburns: One for all all for one
[6:08:45] CeruleanStar: 4x wars and a priest let's go?
[6:08:46] MickeyMacburns: Thats real hardcore
[6:08:58] mattjfrank: What about battlegrounds??
[6:09:25] ZeusDNA: Sounds like you level solo for 6 hours then you get randomly assigned to groups

[6:09:36] Nerendis: You are not grouped while level. @towelliee it’s a draft to get your dungeon group
[6:09:42] samsara1989: @ZeusDNA this
[6:09:44] desmo7: wait, if anyone in your dungeon group dies and you survive, you have to delete?
[6:09:54] Snappole_: how have you been liking HC so far?
[6:09:56] aingard: yes
[6:10:16] MickeyMacburns: That very dangerous all warrior think that the other warrior spotted the the priest tanks the boss^^
[6:10:16] Wildekatze: What happened to the good ole days of hardcore leveling in classic you were naked? Is that not hardcore anymore?
[6:10:40] ObsidianHealer: They're just BG now. @towelliee
[6:10:44] CeruleanStar: HC Gauntlet

[6:13:55] PieceOfPanic: M+ is lazy game design, and a tedious gearing experience.
[6:14:03] ShadowDMG6969: M+ is bad only whenyou don't have peeps to run the higher keys with

[6:14:36] Sayryn: LOL
[6:14:40] PieceOfPanic: It's my opinion. And has been since day one. I preferred Challenge Mode if anything
[6:14:47] MoldyBaby: Some people like what they like
[6:14:49] MickeyMacburns: Can't do the Architect Quest in Blackrock Deeps because you have to be a Ghost to take the Quest.
[6:14:49] jkitchin75: lol
[6:15:00] toyhutt: ROFL
[6:15:01] Zeraeb: lol

[6:15:03] pbnj_kills: how is it lazy though? i wanna know your side
[6:15:04] PotbellyGoat: bamfbrBron
[6:15:04] abracka_: challenge mode is literally m+ with affixes lol
[6:15:07] ShadowDMG6969: M+ Really could be worst, Let's be real they could decrease the drop rate so it's like Mount drops then it'd be overly Tedious lol
[6:15:08] TyThompson: @Towelliee make a track
[6:15:09] PotbellyGoat: Best song
[6:15:10] weirdsp4ce: How do i get a hammer to go with my shield?

[6:15:38] kvnxvo: just for a quest i dont know
[6:15:39] DocDreidel: if the quest kills you (warlock infernal) you die.
[6:15:43] dracer30: had to go play hc on another server, to many weirdos on popular ones lol
[6:15:45] agggro: !death
[6:15:46] MickeyMacburns: To give the quest in you have to be a ghost again^^
[6:15:57] PieceOfPanic: I mean, people are allowed to their opinion. Doesn't make M+ good content LUL
[6:15:57] agggro: You die on warrior?
[6:15:58] VanishSHRoguE: @PieceOfPanic really analyze what you're saying. the context is to have multiple avenues to gear up, no one is telling you to gear up through M+ if its too "tedious for you" go play a game where time isn't a factor. @Towelliee He wants to really practice FAFO -> fuck around, find out!
[6:16:06] Shugaze: we blacksmiths can make the keys to go in BRD @Towelliee
[6:16:07] MickeyMacburns: Scholo mount
[6:16:19] Alamaania: No appeals, just skip quest
[6:16:29] HalfLeif: @PieceOfPanic and your opinion doesn't make it bad content.
[6:16:31] cptncadillac: Paladins never die they are just missing in action
[6:16:34] Woofdog77: Challenge mode at the time was a lot of fun and hard I will agree there
[6:17:00] kvnxvo: gotta go for the male boars
[6:17:06] killerteapotsftw: not the wrong boars, just really rare drop
[6:17:11] MoldyBaby: @vanishshrogue he just stated his opinion and view on the matter from his standpoint. Relax.
[6:17:20] Sarocus: You're chopping those boars up with a 2H sword. Not many intact intestines left

[6:18:16] MickeyMacburns: Ungoro Crater is a Death trap
[6:18:21] PvtHudson093: your next class quest is at 20
[6:18:22] pbnj_kills: I'm not a big mythic+ person but it's 100% one of the best features ever added
[6:18:22] PieceOfPanic: I'm not against other people liking M+, their allowed to? But looking from a gaming design perspective. There's nothing "good" about making your players farm the same items over and over with a minor ilvl increase. Challenge mode on the other hand, didn't do it for gearing. But for a challenge, hence the name.
[6:18:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mythic+ is one of the three pillars in game, along with raiding and PvP
[6:18:31] Zijkrial: I'd loooove more classic dungeons
[6:18:34] CeruleanStar: i'd like to see more strategizing in dungeons opposed to just beat a timer so pull everything and aoe it all down?
[6:18:47] CeruleanStar: like really intricat pulls more difficult than say last pull in TJS
[6:18:48] ShadowDMG6969: M+ made Dungeons worth going thru instead of just the one time for quests or for finding a transmog you wanted
[6:19:08] Zijkrial: @PieceOfPanic M+ is 10x more fun with friends. it's replayable and you get to enjoy just playing the game.
[6:19:15] ShadowDMG6969: Challenge Mode was one set difficulty with little Variation
[6:19:19] MickeyMacburns: I would love to see Mythic + Raiding.
[6:19:25] PieceOfPanic: No. I'm saying, I don't like gearing through M+ since it's redundant work,
[6:19:31] Zedowel: A Little bit of both is good
[6:19:41] the_general01: @PieceOfPanic just like raiding then by your logic
[6:19:42] AnimalCrackers_19: M+ is what gets me back in wow, raiding is too much of a commitment for me.
[6:19:42] Keanuu: challenge mode was sick because you actually had to go back and farm lower content because of the way it would scale into the dungeon. m+ doesn't do that. its just do it faster imo
[6:19:46] Zijkrial: Forced to play the game and get stuff NotLikeThis
[6:19:48] ThrasiusGG: now im forced to play the video game Kappa

[6:19:57] ArcaneSyntax: Also it's not the same stuff season to season anymore
[6:20:03] Nerendis: @pieceofpanic but arena gearing is redundant. Raiding gearing is redundant.
[6:20:08] Sarocus: Without M+, gearing just stops at M0
[6:20:30] ZeusDNA: MMOs are built around farming gear with hopes of getting slightly better gear each time lol
[6:20:38] toyhutt: you just incurred the wrath of T!  The More you Know!
[6:20:44] pbnj_kills: mythic+ made current and old dungeons relevant again which is nice
[6:20:48] Exodeo_: I think that without m+ people would be bored in a season a lot sooner than the current one
[6:20:49] MickeyMacburns: M+ dungeon gear is higher than Raid gear
[6:20:57] Asreyya: hell I would be glad if they added M+ in all versions of the game lol
[6:20:59] DesH58: I don't want to play M+ but I'm forced to play M+ to get good gear, and even to get into the raids
[6:21:04] ArcaneSyntax: Ehhh
[6:21:06] CeruleanStar: i missed mage tower ;(
[6:21:09] reggiepowa: @Exodeo_ yeah like they are on wrath so everyone went to classic era
[6:21:09] ShadowDMG6969: Let's be real without M+ the way the casuals approach the game would stop at LFR Because finding a Raid group that is fun to play with isn't a simple thing
[6:21:13] CeruleanStar: i also enjoyed torghast but /shrug lol
[6:21:26] Imolate_: !death1
[6:21:26] Moobot: @imolate_ https://t.co/VggfVNqVhU
[6:21:27] ArcaneSyntax: @mickeymacburns the raid drops the highest ilvl gear in the game
[6:21:41] tirraldra: @CeruleanStar I also enjoyed it lol
[6:21:55] kw3nk: cant wait to heal again
[6:21:59] HalfLeif: And due to lockout changes pugs are horrible with hundred character turnover in an hour KEKW
[6:21:59] CeruleanStar: saying m+ is bad for the game is like saying flex raiding is bad for the game... lol
[6:22:06] MickeyMacburns: Depends on how high keys you do
[6:22:07] tirraldra: I think they could have done so much more with torghast though D:
[6:22:13] shale93: I would not play retail for last 3 expansions without m+
[6:22:15] abracka_: esp with only having two affixes on a key until +14
[6:22:19] kw3nk: didnt have alot of fun this season as heal
[6:22:26] ShadowDMG6969: As someone who plays on & Off alot I prefer the M+ being available for when i get back into the game & not be far off from being able to run with friends for content they need help with
[6:22:27] aingard: @PieceOfPanic I am sorry, but who is forcing you to get a gear from M+? Do raiding or arena, they made it quite accessible!
[6:22:31] BRob2011: what changes are we talking about ? what makes it easier to get gear from 11s?
[6:22:49] MickeyMacburns: +16 for hero crafting
[6:22:58] Thunder4o: @Towelliee And we still gonna have solo world quest only players that will whine on forums for progression system for them with gear up to Mythic raid ilvl :D
[6:23:03] VanishSHRoguE: @DesH58 you need to understand something and understand it well. Depending on the group you're running with meaning you raid, OTHER PLAYERS depend on you to pull your wheight. We are at a point where pumping out the best ilvl with proper stats takes you a long way in helping kill bosses. Don't be that dude that doesn't do shit and expects to get carried through bosses.
[6:23:07] weirdsp4ce: I'm bad with mythic plus
[6:23:10] cptncadillac: in my guild we have like 3 m+ gorups always competing each other who has the biggest score
[6:23:22] Nerendis: M+ is the best thing since Arenas. I refuse to believe otherwise.
[6:23:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some people enjoy just running Mythic+ keys all the time
[6:23:33] PieceOfPanic: It's lazy game design for sure, and bringing people into a loop of gameplay - instead of using the time for making ACTUAL content.
[6:23:33] Moobot: Tune in Jun 1st for our Second ever SUBATHON! It will be uncapped with tons of prizes and lots of goals!
[6:23:59] PieceOfPanic: It's waters down endgame, instead of BEING endgame

[6:24:12] CeruleanStar: so i've had a tough journey in retail the last few years... i essentially had to drop the game entirely during legion - so when i came back in 9.0, it was really tough to get into m+... i quit again until 10.0 but made it a goal to get all 20's timed and 2500+ rating... it's been a really fun journey and looking to do better in S2 :D
[6:24:12] ShadowDMG6969: M+ is actual content tho lol
[6:24:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Actual content? More story quests?
[6:24:19] veryhairyheyyall: hmm
[6:24:20] Nerendis: Wtf in a mmo isn’t loop of content? What??
[6:24:24] PokerFaceMoose: dungeons are not content?
[6:24:27] Sarocus: Actual content! *shot*
[6:24:30] tirraldra: m+ > 90000 dailies
[6:24:38] weirdsp4ce: I think individual dungeons you have to solo would be cool
[6:24:43] VanishSHRoguE: @PieceOfPanic when was the last time you visited a dungeon thats 10+ years old. You make that content relevant lol, plz stop @PieceOfPanic you lack this logic
[6:24:43] MickeyMacburns: We could have a legendary Gear Lottery for all players that got a Wall reward in that Week
[6:24:46] Nerendis: How is running 100 arenas or weeks of mythic raid not looped content?
[6:24:52] Hyelander_: its an MMORPG. the acutal content is to make things you do with others
[6:24:52] Snabido: Raid+ is the way
[6:25:07] tirraldra: raid + lmao
[6:25:08] jerseyfive: i would buff my class and nerf all the others KEK
[6:25:11] the_bad_goat: Do you have to join the hardcore discord in order to play?
[6:25:12] PieceOfPanic: I don't have the answer. Obviously not at hand, anyway. But I do think there's different avenues to pursue instead of "looping"
[6:25:15] dracer30: i just wish more outdoor content gave good gear
[6:25:29] ZeusDNA: Looping is just what happens in MMOs at endgame lol
[6:25:33] MetallicusGaming: the_bad_goat no, only the hardcore addon is required
[6:25:34] PotbellyGoat: Player housing bamfbrBron

[6:26:39] Nerendis: There isn’t a popular video game that I can think of that doesn’t have looping content.
[6:26:50] Thunder4o: Guys guys guys chill out!!! This fella just want to have every 3 months huge patches with alot of quests/new 10 dungeons and raid.He want "only" that :D
[6:26:54] tirraldra: MORE PET BATTLES
[6:26:57] CeruleanStar: it's like this -- just because *you* don't like it doesn't mean it's bad - and the fact you can't state an alternative drives it home that it's just content you don't like - which is just bitching
[6:26:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like endless procedurely generated stuff, but we saw how Torghast got mangled into being annoying
[6:27:09] ShadowDMG6969: THe only way MMO's can change is finding a way to make the game more immersive which is what DF did
[6:27:12] Lloyder47: There isn't one out there yet which is why you have what has been seen to be the next big thing
[6:27:13] ArcaneSyntax: Also m+ isn't anywhere near as boring now that dungeons change every season.
[6:27:15] doublemeatpalace: Can't have infinite new content, something has to be repetative.
[6:27:27] PieceOfPanic: First off. I would focus more on wide group content, personally. Bring back more raid sizes. Instead of Scaling.
[6:27:28] CeruleanStar: "wont' someone make a game that   IIIIIII like to play?"
[6:27:29] PokerFaceMoose: i think wow has commited pretty hard to raids and m+ being end game, if you do not enjoy that wow may not be the game for you. gw2 has a different content loop that can be fun.
[6:27:36] Cairfaig: They should M+ all the classic dungeons
[6:27:48] PrimaIvoid: @PieceOfPanic I'm all for being of an opinion. But if you can't think of solutions, then you're not actually contributing to the conversation.
[6:27:49] Nerendis: Queuing up for another game of League is still “looping” content.
[6:27:51] PieceOfPanic: That's fair. Indeed, different points of view.
[6:27:54] Templexx: m+ rfc? haha
[6:27:54] Thunder4o: Look the guy wants 40 man raids
[6:27:54] CeruleanStar: and there it is, the flex raid argment i claled it :D
[6:27:56] Asreyya: run the same thing over and over is pretty much an MMO thing to gear anyway
[6:27:58] Lloyder47: ohh you are way in the minority on that no one wants to get 40 people together
[6:27:59] ShadowDMG6969: LMFAO M+ CLASSIC DUNGEONS WOULD BE HILARIOUS
[6:28:02] Zedowel: I was DCing every 10 minutes earlier. I had to reboot my PC for it to stop
[6:28:04] Xirmak: @Cairfaig heh..... no
[6:28:06] mavericks312: even if they did make something new it would eventually be repeated
[6:28:07] tumb_tack: I would love to see more visions type content
[6:28:08] ArcaneSyntax: @cairfaig it would be as much work to just make a new dungeon
[6:28:11] Crunchroll0630: What do you think is the best addition to the game?
[6:28:12] PieceOfPanic: Owh, Magetower I did like. A lot
[6:28:12] weirdsp4ce: Solo dungeons, new monthly short dungeons, world treasure hunts. Not sure if those would necessarily be new content though
[6:28:12] mozavich: @ShadowDMG6969 no
[6:28:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Mage Tower was great when the tuning was spot on
[6:28:20] Keanuu: challenge mode was sick because you actually had to go back and farm lower content because of the way it would scale into the dungeon
[6:28:22] mavericks312: @Thunder4o he would then bitch he cant find 40 ppl
[6:28:27] HalfLeif: I miss pugging raids when there was actual lockouts tho, since putting em together nowadays feels like being a callcenter HR manager, people in-people out constantly

[6:28:58] PokerFaceMoose: or gw2, gw2 is mostly horizontal progression not vertical
[6:29:02] CeruleanStar: M+ bad, flex raid bad, what an argument
[6:29:07] veryhairyheyyall: yep!
[6:29:10] PieceOfPanic: It absolutely is. -But initially challenge mode was just that exactly, "after u did the content".
[6:29:10] stratiss: people would do that in WoW too if it was only one boss
[6:29:10] Lloyder47: give me loot or give me death
[6:29:15] ShadowDMG6969: @ShadowDMG6969 It'd be hilarious because how would the Classic Dungeons even be balanced to handle the way the new Classes 7 Gear sets work
[6:29:24] Thdlock: gear driven but no warforge / tforge Madge
[6:29:29] the_general01: we've been one guy'd lol
[6:29:32] mavericks312: flex raid was actually genius for ppl who cant find a full grp
[6:29:41] Maydie6066: I can't even imagine the mental stress on the Dev's for any large game, trying to satisfy over 1 million players in a game just seems overwhelmingly daunting

[6:31:08] HalfLeif: @mavericks312 people don't have any skin in the game of the group actually succeeding in the raid any more, so people just hop in and out constantly. It's horrible whereas before people toughed it out and finished raids because they didn't wanna waste their lockouts.
[6:31:17] HalfLeif: @mavericks312 so it has upsides but also major downsides

[6:33:05] PieceOfPanic: xD
[6:33:13] CeruleanStar: what do you play at the casino? just poker or tables/craps?
[6:33:20] PieceOfPanic: What's more expensive though, the gambling or the drinking ? LUL
[6:33:27] mavericks312: @HalfLeif but you are right in it does have its negatives in having to pause a raid to replace ppl and what not after every boss

[7:29:28] raldrik: the real question can you buy bags on the AH
[7:29:43] instant_savage: so if u have ksm u cant do the challege cause no one can invite u
[7:29:44] falldrgn: Or no profs.. only get drops from world or quest.. or vendors in town. No dugenons etc..
[7:29:52] PieceOfPanic: UNless ur a rogue
[7:29:52] The13Legion: When did the astronauts choose to eat their sandwich? At launch time
[7:29:53] PieceOfPanic: LUL
[7:30:01] devoted_bee: Soul stones?
[7:30:04] Dyriks: ups
[7:30:07] tenmillion: givin it the ol dick twist

[7:31:13] mavericks312: no forbidden reach ring
[7:31:15] xchaoskingsx: no playing the game
[7:31:21] Hyelander_: Cant use the keyboard and mouse
[7:31:29] ElvineTheSilent: I think that you would need to say on low io main can’t more than let’s say 1500 because most are now just lvling alts

[7:31:33] stabzmcgeee: gotta do sparks quests etc no using alt skips @Towelliee
[7:31:43] CeruleanStar: i think making it a blanket rule of "can only use items, gear, etc that your HC character obtains themselves through drops, quests, or crafting"
[7:31:44] fistofnature: when is this?
[7:31:46] kvnxvo: play on controller, limit buttons
[7:31:49] Xirmak: and bigwigs dbm XD
[7:31:52] reggiepowa: to survive what
[7:31:56] NickLeonhearth: why no ring?
[7:32:02] adxx: They should just make a server that lets you create max level characters and then do these type of HC challenges. People in arena and pvp would love that too
[7:32:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Death Knight enchants are part of their class
[7:32:15] falldrgn: you have to play blindfolded
[7:32:16] patti221: well the forbidden reach ring is obtained through questing.
[7:32:20] mavericks312: @Xirmak found the ff14 player

[7:33:34] CeruleanStar: so like, you get 1 shot that week
[7:33:35] stabzmcgeee: ksm in 1 reset
[7:33:38] Maydie6066: the group can only consist of 4 of the same class as you are playing
[7:33:38] Trekytv: Sounds like this will never get beat 😂 hard mode hard mode
[7:33:46] mavericks312: and you have to level thru shadow lands
[7:33:53] shadow2step: could you use the new starter zone or no
[7:33:54] Sollice: @Maydie6066 Meh that can be done now
[7:33:57] steldam: I have better... No gear kSM....
[7:33:57] NickLeonhearth: I'd prefer getting constant diarrhea and have no toilet paper, sounds more fun than this
[7:33:58] Quojin: can you use AH?
[7:34:10] falldrgn: nah
[7:34:18] PokerFaceMoose: i say ban AH
[7:34:23] Sollice: Use Auction House for consumables
[7:34:24] Maydie6066: can you actually get KSM in 1 reset? dont you need both Tyr and Fort completions?
[7:34:32] Sollice: Because you can only have so many professions
[7:34:40] devoted_bee: So you couldn't be an enchanter then
[7:34:44] falldrgn: no professions, no AH,  just white gear from vedors. RP walk only
[7:34:51] Sayryn: That was painful. First death.
[7:35:04] stabzmcgeee: time all 19s or 20s
[7:35:24] PokerFaceMoose: @Sayryn go agane as they say
[7:35:27] Sollice: Poor @Sayryn

[7:36:32] drewetling: yes compass
[7:36:36] DakoDraggo: F
[7:36:44] adxx: Dark shore is hard when you try to do quests 1-2 levels higher than you. certain mobs just have a lot of health, the bears and cats of the zone are ass
[7:36:46] Daarksyde: north side of that farm
