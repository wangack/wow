[1:03:18] trivotix: @anord999 Yeah, I was surprised with it being so close that they would change
[1:03:20] ArcaneSyntax: I will say, I think Liquid has more in the tank than echo at this point because liquid didn't play for 20 hours yesterday
[1:03:22] neftario105: Cool
[1:03:26] VarlBGem: Now I want a Jaina dog.
[1:03:58] EllisTheMenace1: @ArcaneSyntax they played for 18hours though

[1:04:13] illStefan: is rise hardest this week ?
[1:04:26] anord999: @trivotix to be honest I am not. When they moved a head by 2 percent, they were like now we can make our own strats.
[1:05:03] mmrghost7: echo keeps getting p3 and fail sadge
[1:05:04] ArcaneSyntax: @ellisthemenace1 liquid? No they didn't they started at 11 and ended at 1 am
[1:05:10] instant_savage: man i finally got midnight yesterday, took me 367 attempts
[1:05:16] Towelliee: https://t.co/IX1E9plEAS
[1:05:32] valianya: @towelliee  what resolution do you stream in?  The new Twitch for TV app has terrible resolution issues.  It won't let me watch you any higher than 720p60, and even that is lower quality than it should be.
[1:05:33] tylerwithghosts: Hot take but this week Everbloom has been the hardest. That second boss is a group destroyer
[1:05:38] TheeCableguy: DHT has been rough this week. Final boss with the roots is annoying.
[1:05:58] VarlBGem: That was cool.
[1:06:15] cyrex172: @instant_savage is midnight a mount? whats midnight?

[1:08:28] valianya: @towelliee  Any idea why the Twitch for TV app is throttling you to 720p?
[1:08:50] Mr_Pennywise_: refresh
[1:08:55] Calphurnious: I don't know who I was looking at but one dude had a full horizontal leanback going
[1:09:06] valianya: Yes, I normally watch you at 1080
[1:09:09] TheeCableguy: want a 470 lizzard aug?
[1:09:18] mavericks312: i expect liquid to wake up in the next hr or so
[1:09:32] TheeCableguy: Liquid is already up
[1:09:39] TheeCableguy: stream starting soon
[1:09:39] marineboi1288: Scripe looked like a zombie last night
[1:09:50] altair19992: crazy how the last two bosses are 400 + attempts KEKW
[1:09:51] Mr_Pennywise_: i have it at 1080p but some times the twitch gets stuck at 720p just keep refreshing it will get there
[1:09:53] valianya: They updated the Twitch for TV app and suddenly quality is crap for streams and VODs are worse
[1:09:59] cabalish: it will be a close one

[1:12:57] LekeroleN: Kappa
[1:13:01] Austei: nice seeing method up there on attempts too
[1:13:28] valianya: Not sure they can afford not to sell runs.  The guilds go into gold debt every RWF buying BOEs and splits
[1:13:35] tylerwithghosts: @Towelliee Any interest in 18 WM after your rise key?
[1:13:44] Austei: be great
[1:13:49] VarlBGem: That would be wild.
[1:14:00] mavericks312: honestly method winning would be best for the race overall
[1:14:01] TheeCableguy: Would be wild and fun
[1:14:06] NineThree: true. Liquid had their 6% attempt that was like a 15%ish difference than their previous.
[1:14:07] mackieeswe: echo nice pull this one
[1:15:02] mavericks312: @NineThree right and if thd and firedup dont get confused at the end it could have went further

[1:25:25] valianya: @towelliee  all your videos and vids are throttled down to 720p60 in the Twitch for TV app.  If you're paying for 1080p you might want to look into that.  It's fine on mobile, but the TV app is throttling you, but not other streams.  Cohh and the RWF have 1080 options
[1:25:31] mavericks312: how hard can it be to get to 25 anyway
[1:25:33] ArcaneSyntax: nope
[1:25:49] ArcaneSyntax: mobs are scaled up, but xp values are the same
[1:25:55] parmesanchi: They will change it when new level bands open up tho

[1:28:40] 91Niki: @valianya Sounds like an issue with your tv despite other streams having 1080p options.
[1:28:53] VarlBGem: I didn't realize it, but I was at 720p on my tv monitor, but I just moved it up to 1080p and it's holding, so idk why it might switch back.

[1:29:05] NineThree: Evokers don't seem like great DPS. or is it just this evoker?
[1:29:25] ArcaneMaki: Towel twitch stream output at 1080p on my LG C1

[1:29:31] dawnovun: Thats an aug man
[1:29:42] NobodybetterPat: good get it nerfed for us lol
[1:29:43] Thralazaar: It’s augmentation, it’s a support spec. makes the other 2 do more dam and a bunch of utility @ninethree
[1:29:46] 91Niki: @valianya You are probably much better off googling your issue, TV model/brand + the issue you are having
[1:29:53] CalcasOOM: This part is awful
[1:29:55] Klept2r: is that a Pierre Garcon jersey?
[1:30:00] mavericks312: devs about to be like oh boy here is towelliee again lol

[1:31:37] ialwaysforget7: towelliee... could you explain this boss
[1:31:54] valianya: Been refreshing it, not working for this stream.  @dawnovun  I don't think you realize how crap this latest update to the Twitch for TV app is.  There's no way to set an overall default resolution for all streams.  Every stream defaults to auto every time and it's set low.  I am manually changing resolution up to max every time I enter a stream.  Towelliee 's stream is the only one I've seen so far that only maxed at 720p instead of 1080.
[1:32:35] Masqerader: mine is always 1080 on my phone, there are 4 options, auto, 1080, 720 and the rest
[1:32:37] Niksen_99: Damn walls of text with tech issues lol

[1:47:50] Bowwjack: @Towelliee that set and the overlap with the swirlies is a rough one, but you have a bm hunter so it should be easy, the hunter needs to make sure that he just foacuses on soaks in intermission and not worry about hisdps
[1:48:09] blankvisualz: it also doesn’t help your evoker has been sub 40k dps the whole dungeon

[1:49:53] NVbrutal: just bring all ret pallys lol think they might be the only dps that can live through both orbs blowing up
[1:50:00] cyrex172: question: do the experience gains i get from wow anniversary 19 % boost also count towards quest exp or just monster kills
[1:50:15] cyrex172: im guessing just minster kills r

[1:57:59] JuliuscaesarTV: @Towelliee
[1:58:16] mavericks312: Wpvp is dead in retail lol
[1:58:22] valianya: Ashenvale is turned into a world pvp event styled after Alterac Valley in SoD.  I think it is supposed to activate after a certain amount of kills in Ashenvale or something
[1:58:23] JuliuscaesarTV: retail would be amazing if they did. i miss it
[1:58:32] Shrenko: world pvp in retail isnt dead!!

[2:00:35] strike879: retail wpvp is like that one meme picture but then instead with 1 gnome and 5 orcs
[2:00:40] valianya: World pvp in retail boils down to pvpers ganking non pvpers and griefing leveling characters to feel powerful, at the expense of the other players feeling bad.

[2:10:51] TheItalianStallion321: @ChadShields usually the boss gets nerfed after the world first kills. maybe a week or 2 later
[2:10:51] TheeCableguy: @Lilurrn They also started later
[2:11:01] TheItalianStallion321: around that time frame
[2:11:01] mavericks312: @ChadShields no its an execution fight you need to execute perfectly

[2:12:45] TheeCableguy: If it goes to reset the question is do they skip the reset or lockout

[3:23:28] Snabido: Method beats Echo, oh the shambles that can ensue LUL
[3:23:35] mavericks312: this has been the most 3 way raid in along time
[3:23:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Method could definitely do it
[3:23:56] mavericks312: if method were to kill it first or finish better then echo EU would riot lol
[3:23:58] Collected1: yeah this is a GabeN fight

[3:30:46] mavericks312: how well rested is echo really though
[3:30:54] NicStone8: rest makes a huge difference
[3:30:58] Lilurrn: I think echo is probably drained
[3:31:00] NicStone8: reduces the small easy mistakes
[3:31:14] Rudric_Ice: boss is dying today if theres no ''secret'' phase
[3:31:34] mavericks312: i think your down playing the 21 hr day they put in yesterday and probably longer watching liquid for a while
[3:31:34] jarilrpg: just watch THD, he is sleeping most of the time
[3:31:37] NicStone8: agreed

[3:32:15] TweektheProphet: who wouldn't be going 15 - 18 hrs at the lvl they need to play at
[3:32:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: THD is actually looking wide awake for him, I think the bright lights just kind of mess with him
[3:33:04] Collected1: how do you even sleep after raiding like this
[3:33:10] Collected1: your brain would just be spinning for hours

[3:36:48] Snabido: Whats this, did Blizz plug life support back into hots?
[3:37:07] Collected1: i could never raid at this level. all i see is shit on the ground.
[3:37:13] whopperplopped: Yeah I feel like they have to leave it alone
[3:37:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's just a matter of optimizing everything, yeah
[3:37:21] mavericks312: both guilds are sub 10% so i doubt they touch it
[3:37:30] Rudric_Ice: @Snabido they kinda doing it u got 3 patch notes in one month thats a lot
[3:37:32] mavericks312: i dont think method is in any kill territory yet
[3:37:41] whopperplopped: I feel like they need to rotate the boss more
[3:37:50] Seventhedeadly: omg this pull is amazing
[3:37:59] Davedaman26: got a fourth guild on this boss
[3:38:12] NineThree: Liquid already looking fresh this morning though. easy into P3

[3:47:11] Strifelol: A lot of retail places do that
[3:47:12] Mecabeast: i saw a tiktok of a couple at target exposing the same thing
[3:47:15] jarilrpg: lots of stores do that
[3:47:27] mavericks312: most sales are just prices doubled and cut by 55%
[3:47:32] Strifelol: Yep
[3:47:36] evnaae: best buy is highway robbery lmao
[3:47:44] 91Niki: And that is WHY you use a price tracker
[3:48:14] jarilrpg: people don't have money for that shit anymore
[3:48:17] CardinalTX: im surprised best buy is still in business
[3:48:21] Prisana: The line at my best buy for curbside pickup was longer then to get in
[3:48:25] MackPlays: That was 50 years ago
[3:48:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah there used to be mobs of people fighting over deals in the stores
[3:48:29] Treehop: Remember the people in tents outside for days?
[3:48:31] 91Niki: Remember when things actually used to be 50-75% off on Black Fridays. I remember
[3:48:32] mavericks312: ppl at our best buy were still bum rushing for 2 or 3 ps5s at a time
[3:48:46] mrwaddles22: best buys were busy..just not as much in store. its all transitioned to online sales. their warehouse picks and shipments are insane
[3:49:03] Mecabeast: i was shopping around for a tv and it was same price everywhere like where is the deal there
[3:49:04] Moobot: For 10% off go to -> https://gameradvantage.com/?ref=TOWEL or use code "TOWEL" at checkout!
[3:49:12] mavericks312: yea if your buying tvs right now your buying older models
[3:49:14] 91Niki: I remember people waiting in line for consoles being a good chunk off
[3:49:31] 91Niki: Now it's like 10% off SeemsGood
[3:49:39] eakiller: if they have any
[3:49:49] Strifelol: Well black fridays used to be only on Friday now, it's a week long sale event lol
[3:49:50] mavericks312: i still shop mostly bric and mortar
[3:50:04] 91Niki: @Strifelol Here in denmark they are just calling it black november LUL
[3:50:16] mavericks312: @Strifelol hell some stores start there stuff in october
[3:50:20] MackPlays: When you have Black Friday “month” and Black Friday “week”. The spirit of black FRIDAY is dead
[3:50:37] ArcaneMaki: When our company got bought by Sony and we became a first party studio, they sent us a PS5 as a welcoming gift. It was great as they were still being hard to find.
[3:50:46] Strifelol: @91Niki lmao really wtf
[3:51:01] Strifelol: @mavericks312 Yeah it's crazy, I start getting emails "Early black friday sales!!!"
[3:51:10] 91Niki: @Strifelol Yeah our versions of Walmart and similar stores has had signs saying "Black November" since the 1st of November LUL
[3:51:11] CardinalTX: I work grocery retail. Cubside is big business but they dont make much if any profit because of labor costs. Profit comes from brick and mortar shoppers
[3:52:04] mavericks312: i couldnt fathom living in a 100% online shopping world
[3:52:28] Strifelol: @91Niki That's wild lol
[3:52:31] 91Niki: I actually got really good deals on a bunch of books this Black Friday week. Got myself 10 books HYPERS and saved a bunch on it
[3:52:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've been working on a human brewmaster and they did nerf keg smash, compared to what it used to be
[3:53:00] 91Niki: Got my moms birthday present for a decent amount off too. Besides that, deals on electronics are ass

[3:53:44] 91Niki: I was looking to get pc parts to build a new pc, but all pc parts are like 5% off or so LUL not worth it. Whoooptiedoo i saved 5 bucks
[3:53:46] TurtleThumbWar: completed a +9 Alta and then immediately failed a +5 dawn of the infinites cuz healer didn’t know how to keep chrome alive on final boss. feelsbadman
[3:53:57] TheDevilFish: I member the time in Germany, when Media Markt announced that they would reduce the amount by the applicable sales tax (which was at that time 16% I think), shit got wild. Accusations that they increased the prices just a day before, so that sometimes you would have to pay even more... I mean sometimes you would get some good offers, but since then and knowing that shit, I got cautious from the start :D
[3:54:23] mavericks312: @91Niki yea PC parts havent actually been on sale since like 2020 especially with streaming being more widely known now
[3:54:32] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Yep
