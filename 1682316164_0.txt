[2:44:42] ArcaneSyntax: they gave it a 7 and complained that there was nothing to do at endgame
[2:44:43] Murlock07: ofc ign....
[2:44:45] Masqerader: IGN gave Battlefield 2042 7/10  can u take it seriouslys?
[2:44:46] abracka_: "Dragonflight is a sharply-written and breathtaking experience for the first few dozen hours, but suffers from somewhat threadbare endgame options."
[2:44:47] GameWithDerp: guessing its a combo of all tiers released together and how good DF is -- early week watching them do 30 splits to then go into mythic randomly vs as soon as servers up   felt weird
[2:44:48] Oldduketree007: isn't Ign famous for taking pay for reviews?
[2:44:54] devoted_bee: Maybe because of all the bugs
[2:45:03] Sarocus: Ign isnt exactly the pinnacle of professionalism
[2:45:07] mavericks312: ign blows ff14 and darksouls games
[2:45:11] BoezIRL: got my magmashell
[2:45:12] Aegllor: IGN wouldn’t know good if it slapped them in the face
[2:45:12] Shrenko: IGN has a big following ofc people will get influenced by them eventhough they suck
[2:45:27] cyrex172: morning everybody
[2:45:36] Snabido: Have you gotten the JC recipe from storms, towelliee?
[2:45:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know how anyone could rank Dragonflight as being bad. It's not perfect, but overall it's pretty good
[2:45:41] ArcaneSyntax: the DF reviewer also gave Shadowlands an 8
[2:46:12] cyrex172: shadowlands an 8???
[2:46:12] Saucy722: I've done 30 hours of storms, probably more by now.. I'ts less than that
[2:46:16] Oldduketree007: ign is high on something
[2:46:17] cyrex172: more like .8
[2:46:18] Wulfgrym: 8 out of 1000?
[2:46:22] Shrenko: I would say Shadowlands was an 8 at the start
[2:46:26] nikodemuscrowley: reviewing an expansion right when it comes out is dumb
[2:46:26] ArcaneSyntax: the review complained there wasn't torghast.
[2:46:41] Slapboxh: I ended up buying the neck, gave up farming
[2:46:50] xstraightbrutal: Dragonflight is a 10/10 for me
[2:46:52] Oldduketree007: I liked first raid hated the side stuff xD
[2:47:02] firewalltwitch: shadowlands was bad at the start too, the fact u needed to flight path to each zone titled me
[2:47:07] aDirtybirdy: how about them Colts? @towelliee
[2:47:10] scumlucki: hope we get a dracthyr tank class
[2:47:22] firewalltwitch: 7 is accurate for a normal gamer
[2:47:26] mcbuttchuggins: it just came out??

[2:47:43] cinnamints: I had to stop reading IGN years ago b/c all their reviews are riddled with "did you even read/watch/play the subject material?" errors

[5:19:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, Dragonflight does use WoD-style scaling for PvP gear it's good
[5:20:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: It means that the guy in crafted PvP gear has a chance when fighting the guy in full conquest gear (when that happens), it's good for PvP

[6:12:10] zeeAbe: There is another cave just below the entrance
[6:12:12] s7wede: you don't need to see it

[6:17:42] gfield2k: @mavericks312 I would say. This is the only Sport where there is two goats. Ronaldo an Messi. But this puts Messi ahead of him. But Ronaldo will have a few more World Cups
[6:17:48] magilync: I think the anomaly thing should be reworked. Really frustrating fighting to the back of a cave in combat, only for the buff to run out
