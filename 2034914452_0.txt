[4:54:04] Arbs_OW: if you do it when i'm not raiding I don't mind helping
[4:54:19] krome2dadome: @avenueone i think it goes away next week but i could def be wrong
[4:55:15] Begasaur: i need to try to squeak out 2% mastery on the shaman so i can hit 100% overload. but all i got was crit stuff today

[6:02:04] trollmasta66: are you fully clearing heroic before last bosses?
[6:02:24] mattiguesss: dang.....thats a nice shade of green
[6:02:43] RealXrave: i want that mount so badly :(
[6:03:03] mattiguesss: say word, @RealXrave
[6:03:24] trollmasta66: paly is hot garbage, does less damage than end of last patch
[6:03:26] dankNstein_: ret single target is pretty bad in pve i think they might get buffed
[6:03:32] happyheals: if you start trying now, then by the time it is good then you can have it
[6:03:45] dlarneK: are disc priests good right now ?
[6:03:52] happyheals: yes
[6:04:06] RealXrave: ive only ever gotten to elite never glad
[6:04:18] dlarneK: I quit after season 2... how do I catch up on gear lol
[6:04:19] atoker: your team struggles vs dh/dk/rsham sometimes
[6:04:22] Adrillon: Idk, i kind of hate the system for legendaries. Like ive been clearing Heroic fyrakk since the first week its been enabled to drop on two toons havent gotten one
[6:04:27] Teeball: Mesman
[6:04:31] Teeball: How're we doing
[6:04:32] Adrillon: Friend of mine who randomly plays got it week 3
[6:04:33] dlarneK: also are there any epics I need to keep a look out for ?
[6:04:51] Teeball: Trying to game?
[6:04:59] Teeball: I'll heal some 2s
[6:05:29] happyheals: Yes, an item called Jaina's Locket
[6:05:39] dlarneK: ty
[6:05:47] happyheals: it is very effective when used over mage portals
[6:05:52] atoker: @dlarneK oh man, you're in a rough spot... you'll have to heal in shuffles right now, but it will be ROUGH cuz everyone is geared
[6:06:19] dlarneK: hmmm gotcha. okay. not worth doing honor grind ?
[6:07:23] happyheals: I just send honor and conq marks from healing shuffles tro altsz
[6:07:24] atoker: @dlarneK you'll still have to grind honor, you need 200k honor for the world pvp gear, so you're better off doing shuffle and 2s as a healer to even have a CHANCE at getting caught up
[6:08:59] atoker: @dlarneK you could farm collectable stuff until season 4, then you'll be on par with everyone else.... you could also do BLITZ NOW because you will scale up to 473
[6:10:40] atoker: @dlarneK I have fresh alts that I can't use yet, because they're in full greens... so I'm grinding conquest tokens and honor tokens to  get them caught up
[6:10:56] atoker: *on my mains*
[6:11:34] FoxiekittenWoW: @dlarneK you are not far behind at all, i just went throught it and you can get almost bis gear in a day or two
[6:12:20] happyheals: I started a few days ago and have a resto druid at 485
[6:12:22] atoker: @dlarneK but I WOULD NOT recommend random bgs, because you'll face fully geared 5 mans with rows of consumables that just farm the bracket and grief the enemy team
[6:12:27] happyheals: its not too hard
[6:14:56] FoxiekittenWoW: @atoker you know you can just lower your mmr on purpose and farm completely new players with no gear for super fast conquest and honor? you dont need to try push your ratings with green ah gear. I feel like you advice here on the gearing matter is so very wrong. No flame ofc.
[6:15:11] happyheals: I may as well push my druid in 2s this week. Mes and I got to 1614. It was a good conq farm
[6:15:21] FoxiekittenWoW: @atoker you can get full gear in a day
[6:15:39] FoxiekittenWoW: @atoker especially as a healer
[6:16:19] atoker: it's 200k honor to get a full world pvp set
[6:16:22] atoker: ok well
[6:16:26] atoker: I guess I'm wrong
[6:16:36] FoxiekittenWoW: why do you want the world pvp set?
[6:17:01] happyheals: nice- honor in rbgs weekly
[6:17:26] atoker: yeah gl getting into those
[6:17:27] FoxiekittenWoW: it makes 0 sense to farm the world pvp set, when you can get full conquest almost in a day which is better
[6:17:33] FoxiekittenWoW: sure you can farm the wep
[6:18:22] happyheals: you will still be a few short
[6:18:44] FoxiekittenWoW: yes sure, but you can craft alot of gear also
[6:18:53] FoxiekittenWoW: i mean i just geared a resto shaman in one day the other day
[6:18:57] FoxiekittenWoW: the only thing i did
[6:19:00] happyheals: I still have 4 honor pieces
[6:19:10] FoxiekittenWoW: was to get the green ah gear for 5k gold or less
[6:19:16] happyheals: tru dat homie
[6:19:25] FoxiekittenWoW: then i dropped my mmr
[6:19:28] FoxiekittenWoW: and i farmed
[6:19:30] happyheals: hell no
[6:19:34] FoxiekittenWoW: arena for conquest/honor
[6:20:10] FoxiekittenWoW: then i farmed to 1600 for the free piece when i had abit of gear
[6:20:16] FoxiekittenWoW: i crafted two item
[6:20:31] FoxiekittenWoW: and boom i was full gear almost
[6:20:58] happyheals: I used to do epic rbgs only as horde on a freshy fresh, but it sounds like the battleground blitz scales you up
[6:21:17] happyheals: so just walk in wearing your homeless garb
[6:21:43] Gr33nleet: is ret playable?
[6:21:43] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[6:21:46] FoxiekittenWoW: but you dont need honor to get gear? why do you want to do bgs

[7:26:19] Cchewwy: how do u socket gear im not great at this
[7:26:56] dawsonator171: I've got pve gear to craft for embellishments so I don't really want to craft anything else.

[7:30:03] dawsonator171: I don't PVP that much on the DH cuz people tell me I'm shit.
[7:30:04] rizdane: dk is just broken
[7:30:07] Othernate: That lock was dead as soon as you ran threw the gates
[7:30:30] rizdane: but its ok punish all the locks
[7:31:08] Othernate: You ain't shit @dawsonator171

[7:31:33] happyheals: me too
[7:31:39] happyheals: I'm pretty
[7:31:45] happyheals: but I'm shit
[7:32:07] Othernate: That gets you so far in life @happyheals
[7:32:09] dawsonator171: PVE build is master commander or w/e it is.
[7:32:32] atoker: I wish I could re-work the dk talent tree so there wouldn't be as many dead talents
[7:32:48] happyheals: The face of of Porta-Potty companies
[7:33:20] Othernate: Then you would be a dev working for Activision @atoker and you would have no soul
[7:33:54] dawsonator171: I've contemplated going commander of the dead because I've ended up with extreme amounts of mastery.
[7:34:21] happyheals: >9000
[7:35:30] atoker: that
[7:35:33] dawsonator171: You're only going ghoulish frenzy in order to get more festering stacks tbh.
[7:35:34] atoker: 's my build
[7:35:39] atoker: or the build I use
[7:36:24] atoker: I sac the talent under double coils for the disease multiplier
[7:36:29] dawsonator171: I'm up to 7500 mastery, but that counts Zone of focus.
[7:36:56] Othernate: Why not 9000 @dawsonator171 ? ...
[7:37:18] dawsonator171: because there are no mastery pvp trinkets.
[7:37:44] Solushun: @Othernate 581 mastery
[7:38:25] Briggsy22: can you bring back garry
[7:39:04] dawsonator171: I imagine if you would reposition runes in the coding it wouldn't hide them. it has to be designed layering where the player frames want to be front always.

[8:33:49] SporadicLive: whats up mr mes
[8:34:14] SporadicLive: i have started playing uhdk and wanted to ask u a couple questions about talent choices
[8:34:25] SporadicLive: do u ever play ebon fever over bursting sores?
[8:34:46] ianryan306: all u have to do is google “wow pvp leaderboards” and look at all the top dks
[8:35:03] ianryan306: rot spec is #1 generally, claw build with bursting sores against kiting classes like mage
[8:35:20] Gr33nleet: warr vs dk who win ?
[8:35:23] SporadicLive: i think there's lots of situational talent changes which will be the theme of my questions for sure.
[8:35:27] ianryan306: umholy blight / ebon fever / defile main spec
[8:35:38] ianryan306: plaguebringer
[8:35:46] ianryan306: 2 pts in morbidity
[8:35:51] ianryan306: no harbinger or reaping
[8:36:17] darth__necrosis: thats reach tbh
[8:36:52] ianryan306: no its not lol its data
[8:37:19] darth__necrosis: clawing shadows w/ full coil build, reaping, is absurd big burst, nearly 1 shots
[8:37:53] StargoddessOG: Cheer1000
[8:37:54] StreamElements: StargoddessOG just cheered 1000 bits PogChamp
[8:38:10] SporadicLive: when do you decide to swap between clawing and scourge strike?
[8:38:22] StargoddessOG: <3 Keep the dream alive <3
[8:38:29] ianryan306: you will do less damage overall with claw build but more burst single target yes
[8:38:34] ianryan306: obviously
[8:38:56] StargoddessOG: you went all crazy haha
[8:39:07] darth__necrosis: @ianryan306 its how unh can secure kills, esp with reaping. Just feels too nice.
[8:39:17] StargoddessOG: awkward haha
[8:39:19] indithedog: its huge LOL
[8:39:20] Lythi: good ol patchday UI
[8:39:47] StargoddessOG: It makes the struggles worth the cuddlez later xD
[8:40:14] Lythi: i saw correctly that we basically got zero class tuning right?
[8:40:17] addyz0r: I set up udk yesterday with pve specs. I didnt like them
[8:40:42] addyz0r: any specs that feels good with coil being more valuable?
[8:40:51] stockbridge10: more dk huh
[8:44:27] Lythi: better DK wins

[8:44:41] SporadicLive: do you ever drop rotten/harbinger/reaping?
[8:45:00] happyheals: what would be a solid 2s partner for my druid?
[8:45:00] ianryan306: yes he does
[8:45:12] ianryan306: for blight, defile and 2nd morb point
[8:45:34] ianryan306: tbh i despise rot spec
[8:45:52] Lythi: you think hotfix tuning or next week before AWC?
[8:46:31] SporadicLive: sorry, whats the math on that? i thought it was just essentially 2x disease dam
[8:46:39] SporadicLive: with 100% uptime on scourgestrike buff
[8:46:54] ianryan306: against melee plague is better imo
[8:47:03] ianryan306: bc easier to get scourge off
[8:48:04] Lythi: how do you  max clawing dmg btw, do you alternate coil/claw for the dmg buff?
[8:48:04] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[8:48:19] ianryan306: i cant get more than 2-3 melee globals on mages at a time
[8:48:20] ianryan306: ever
[8:48:34] avenueone: dominant healer in all pvp*
[8:48:35] happyheals: so I should get another resto druid 2s partner
[8:49:15] happyheals: We will stealth the q
[8:49:16] Lythi: oooh wait its a buff after doomburst, not a 1stack NotLikeThis  i should read my talents better
[8:49:32] SporadicLive: do you prio coiling when u have max runic power?
[8:49:39] happyheals: yeah, I was wondering if unholy or like dh was better
[8:49:46] avenueone: except ret
[8:49:49] armin_ed: war/druid
[8:49:56] Solushun: BM Hunter @happyheals
[8:50:05] happyheals: i pulled up pvp leaderboard
[8:50:08] Solushun: trap every go stun DPS cyclone healer off trap ggs
[8:50:11] GentleKimmo: !watchtime
[8:50:11] StreamElements: GentleKimmo has spent  3 days 6 hours watching notmes
[8:50:26] ianryan306: rogue priest is better than rogue druid
[8:50:30] ianryan306: imo
[8:50:38] Solushun: outlaw rogue druid better i think sub rogue yea
[8:50:44] SporadicLive: as a learning uhdk, do u think i should play scourgestrike every game until im more comfortable
[8:51:36] ianryan306: agreed
[8:52:07] happyheals: no attaboys?
[8:52:28] ianryan306: by every button that lights up you mean literaly just death coil lol
[8:53:18] SporadicLive: when do you drop the coil talents? into mage where its harder to farm coil procs?
[8:53:38] enok92: mes with Kappa
[8:53:51] ianryan306: no the opposite
[8:54:43] SporadicLive: rotten/harbinger/reaping @notmes
[8:55:14] Xcyyted: should i prio death coiling to spend runic power or bursting wounds with clawing?:P dumb question but ye
[8:55:20] ianryan306: its really only one or the other, scourge disease build or claw and claw is easier to play esp against mages
[8:55:30] ianryan306: claw includes coil talents
[8:55:50] ianryan306: coil first then claw
[8:56:13] ianryan306: especially with proc cuz that bursts a sore too
[8:57:45] Solushun: WOOOOOOOOOO
[8:58:15] fr0zendog: Legendary weapon dont need for pvp?
[8:58:28] avenueone: mes just wants it too badly so it wont drop
[8:58:37] ianryan306: its BiS lol
[8:58:43] ianryan306: just no one has it who pvps
[8:58:44] SporadicLive: do you ever play necromancers bargain?
[8:58:53] atoker: mes, are you going to replace your chest piece with the conquest chest piece and your cloak with the crafted silken cloak?
[8:59:15] darth__necrosis: @fr0zendog its 50% nerfed in pvp on top of the stats just being bleh for unholy. No need to waste gold on it if u just pvp
[8:59:28] SporadicLive: what would make u swap into necro bargain? seems like a good baseline talent
[8:59:28] happyheals: aww
[8:59:34] SporadicLive: jsut the comp ur playing and what ur fighting?
[8:59:35] ianryan306: the ilvl and melee top damage is nuts

[9:01:40] ianryan306: how much gold is it?
[9:02:06] happyheals: if you strive to min max then one say you will evolve into a max maxer
[9:02:30] darth__necrosis: @ianryan306 after all the time it takes to drop, and then having to do things to actually make it a viable weapon through crafting stuff or buying w/e from the AH that it requires, almost 2m gold
[9:02:36] happyheals: 5% dam is a lot of dam
[9:03:08] Lythi: yeah weapon is down to 200-300k now
[9:03:11] darth__necrosis: It was 2m when ppl started getting it

[10:20:16] waitimdesyncd: now it should contrast a lot, make it easier to tell
[10:21:06] waitimdesyncd: @boostgold7  Big true, BUT having 2x doom burst procs is kinda nutty and clawing on top there are so many pros and cons D:
[10:21:42] waitimdesyncd: your char is so geared man I cant handle the hotness
[10:22:11] waitimdesyncd: @boostgold7  name? I wanna check it out Im already looking at the top 10
[10:22:38] waitimdesyncd: patrick?
[10:23:32] waitimdesyncd: sub rogue go next

[10:24:32] boostgold7: Påtrick-Tarren Mill
[10:24:39] waitimdesyncd: you were around 90% mastery and then dropped to 71% when they bursted you. Looks juicy when it goes high
[10:25:21] boostgold7: lets you play necro aura + 2/2 morbity amd frenzy its such insane dam
[10:25:23] waitimdesyncd: doom burst seems juicy ye
[10:25:25] guitguit34: he play the dot build
[10:25:31] guitguit34: not clawing shadow
[10:25:36] guitguit34: he s Why no doomburst
[10:26:30] waitimdesyncd: but doomburst is free burst and wound procs D;
[10:26:58] alltimer1986: @notmes yo what up
[10:26:59] boostgold7: having perma 12% damage is a good trade for doom though
[10:27:33] waitimdesyncd: no
[10:27:41] waitimdesyncd: you just take out 1 point from ghoulish frenzy
[10:27:50] waitimdesyncd: thats like 1% over all dam you lose for doomburst
[10:28:04] waitimdesyncd: makes no sense having that ghoulish frenzy point instead of doom burst imo
[10:28:34] waitimdesyncd: and necro aura is only 4% in pvp
[10:28:49] waitimdesyncd: but imma test it for sure
[10:29:52] boostgold7: @waitimdesyncd nah bc necro aura 4% dam and another point in morbidity so another 3% dam and frenzy 5% on transform
[10:30:59] boostgold7: i'd rather the extra dam over 70k coils every 15 or so secs
[10:31:00] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[10:31:01] alltimer1986: 20% seems huge ! only way we kill honestly is with big coil procs
[10:31:28] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/VvQNdB
[10:31:39] boostgold7: guess it depends, im playing dk/dh at 2.3cr so i just need to pump
[10:32:26] waitimdesyncd: @boostgold7   we dont need to talk about morbidity, just take 1 point from ghoulish frenzy and put it in sudden doom, rest is honor talents and 5% dam for 15 sec of 60sec is different rom doom burst damage all throughout the game to keep wouds up even at range
[10:33:32] boostgold7: i dunno bro, ive got a 70% win rate at 2.3cr atm so its preference i guess, i like pure dam build
[10:34:02] alltimer1986: if you are not playing defile your trolling I swear
[10:34:44] boostgold7: ofc
[10:35:14] waitimdesyncd: @boostgold7  yeah a lot of people are around that mmr. myself included, but im looking into builds to breach 2400 earlier than not. All the DK specs are really good at the moment. We are just curious why the no doom burst works better from what you say
[10:35:32] boostgold7: not mmr, cr
[10:35:42] waitimdesyncd: yeah same
[10:36:05] boostgold7: ok Kappa
[10:36:17] waitimdesyncd: But we are curious to what makes it so good since we havent tested without doomburst ever
[10:36:24] alltimer1986: no one can see defile still right? still bugged
[10:36:39] boostgold7: ive said, its an insane amount more damage over doomburst, you're gaining necro aura for 1
[10:36:57] waitimdesyncd: @boostgold7  pm me and we can measure cocks (cr) if thats how you want to flex
[10:37:17] boostgold7: im not flexing anything just know ur capping that's all
[10:37:52] boostgold7: yeah doomburst is nice and its burst but consistent pressure which is what wins 80% of these rdru damp comps is huge
[10:38:06] waitimdesyncd: no sudden doom
[10:39:25] alltimer1986: your playing clawing ?
[10:40:00] boostgold7: i play with a dh so frenzy is nice for every other essence break apoc goes
[10:40:17] waitimdesyncd: yeah it looks like a very noob friendly build that you'd make people that cant line up burst and cooldowns play, but its r1 rn in EU so we have to check
[10:40:37] alltimer1986: clawing build is the best hands down this might be better in RBG
[10:41:18] boostgold7: dont get me wrong, i play clawing into mls etc or these double lock russian abusers but 80% of the time im full dot dam
[10:41:28] alltimer1986: not having reaping blows I swear your just ticking them down
[10:41:46] waitimdesyncd: im going to test the no doom build in 3s now just to feel it out
[10:42:31] boostgold7: doomburst is probably better low mmr
[10:42:54] boostgold7: but every comp on eu at glad and above is rdru dampeners
[10:43:29] waitimdesyncd: would patrick be better off with 2x silken than mettle with that buiild
[10:44:55] waitimdesyncd: yeah, but I feel like doomburst is what pushes people over the edge and more often than not you get a semi short game just from bursting with klepto
[10:45:11] waitimdesyncd: I play dev/uhdk at that rating tho so we got klepto
[10:45:30] stockbridge10: gl
[10:45:32] boostgold7: whats ur char @waitimdesyncd
[10:46:02] waitimdesyncd: open dms @boostgold7  i wanna see ur stats too
[10:46:11] boostgold7: sure
[10:48:42] indithedog: ton more healing
[10:49:27] boostgold7: i think its really strong if ur on comms and syncing essence / apoc etc its just pure pressure and dam and 90% of the time we go healer yea

[11:36:22] smoochins: idk why i just didn't type in stream chat
[11:37:39] waitimdesyncd: idk if it is worth it for tank dk meta, but I tried the 3% leech talent + wrist and cloak leech, and I healed 530k over a 2 min game doing 13 mil dam. Im surprised it was my higest healing
[11:37:56] AutismPaladin: Do you think unholy will get nerfed soon?

[11:41:15] indithedog: dont worry surely next week will be leggo
[11:42:58] waitimdesyncd: Mate try that 1 point from unholy bond into 3% leech with that patrick build
[11:43:07] waitimdesyncd: I swear it is actually going ham on the heal
[11:44:12] waitimdesyncd: check it
[11:45:02] waitimdesyncd: it feels like a whole extra health bar for 1 talent point
[11:45:21] waitimdesyncd: the leech helps keep blue silken high hmmm
[11:46:54] Lythi: class design is fascinating
[11:46:58] aant02: did we get lego chat :O

[11:49:11] Solushun: I think that its a good comp... but we get punished harder vs the CC heavy team with no commms
[11:50:03] AutismPaladin: Any ebola coming up?

[11:50:38] Kazgry: @notmes do u have your platter profile on your discord?

[11:53:04] Solushun: i think a stun on rogue and be close to jerry for a quick reverse on the trap into a kite away with full hots can maybe try for science
[11:53:15] Solushun: cuz rogue has to respond to the stun
[11:53:23] aant02: early use of dark maybe for opener?
