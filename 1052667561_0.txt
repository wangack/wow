[3:33:23] Samonasuke: im actually scared to get the vaccine since i react so harshly to stuff like that..i was sick for weeks when i got my flu shot
[3:33:25] veryhairyheyyall: that's interesting
[3:33:29] sainnt757: This a heroic @Towelliee
[3:33:30] desmo7: did she download windows 10? Kappa
[3:33:41] trivwik: The person that gave that vaccine got the extra unemployment perks
[3:33:44] Lornetc: Basically, the main risk of getting too large a dose COULD be getting an immune reaction.
[3:34:14] infinitrus: attunement to eye
[3:34:25] infinitrus: the epic off last boss
[3:34:50] TheUnagiRoll: second dose reaction is because your body is already learning that this virus is bad and trying to defend against it. 1st dose can be because you may have been asymptomatic and your body is responding like it would to the second one
[3:35:04] Ramdorpser: qualified
[3:35:18] trivwik: That is comforting

[4:56:51] Shadypies: it does, overpower will blink like a proc
[4:56:59] Koalabaer79: looks like super heavyweight box fight... 3 seconds one hit :D

[5:01:44] EggwithEdges: Retail is more starter friendly
[5:02:01] xanarel22: tfw getting ads as a sub
[5:02:14] maalow: definitely try retail first, discover the game and then try classic to see how was the game before

[5:02:45] NtelisOG: retail feels smoother and a lot friendlier, I played since SL and i'm playing classic now.
[5:02:47] Sleepy_Platypus: are there going to be new classic servers? @Towelliee

[5:05:28] Shadypies: doubt it
[5:05:36] luckfore: it sounded like it was
[5:05:49] Shinjuro: hillarious title tho
[5:05:51] LSBreed: that's part of the reason I like Terry.
[5:05:59] Cibaninja: ESO crying in the corner cause nobody talks about them.....shame lol

[5:06:57] Cibaninja: A Loooong time ago
[5:07:02] Broomba: He doesn’t play ff14 neither does asmon - need to stop click bait crap
[5:07:05] Shadypies: aparrantly they got more players o.0
[5:07:15] bakkich: Competition is good tho. albeit small
[5:07:17] schizowillie: FF14 is fun though
[5:07:22] SrpskaLegija: The only serious contender at the time was SWTOR if EA would have fucked up pressuring the realease :D
[5:07:23] heavymetalhorns: I tried Final Fantasy and I was so bored... the start of that game is not made to draw in new players
[5:07:25] Shadypies: theyll all be back in 9.1 :)
[5:07:25] LSBreed: The only thing that will ever bring WoW down is WoW...
[5:07:28] Dixietwist: i still say we should grab bell and asmon and ship them off to a lone island so we dont have to hear there bullshyt anymore lol
[5:07:42] EggwithEdges: I hate how you can't customize your rotation and classes on FFXIV
[5:07:55] Ki_Ki_01: I miss Rift
[5:08:02] Thoreya: never seen a game try so hard to be more relevant than it actually is in my life
[5:08:03] theoriginalzinng: im having fun in ff14 during the lull. its not the same at all but it has fun gameplay just like other games do
[5:08:09] techdough: It is starting to stand some time though, to be fair
[5:08:21] Shadypies: poo
[5:08:21] Ohdies: the only game capable of killing wow is wow
[5:08:30] Broomba: FF14 is fun
[5:08:32] EggwithEdges: I loved playing Bard in Rift
[5:08:58] Meowrawrmoo: towHype
[5:08:59] schizowillie: They all have those shitty ass graphics though all of them
[5:08:59] Tanaros: I quit WoW for Rift back during Cata. Mostly because Cata
[5:09:02] swordart_19: @dixietwist gachiBASS island
[5:09:05] theoriginalzinng: i thought "sensible" was grounds for bans on twitter
[5:09:06] EggwithEdges: Stopped playing Rift when they started selling gear in store
[5:09:20] Ki_Ki_01: Sentinel <3
[5:09:33] Sethyrin: I play both WoW and FFXIV slootYEP
[5:09:34] Shadypies: i think its alot of sweaty nerding out because everyones waiting for 9.1
[5:09:34] Khlaro: That's what Asmon said yesterday. It's healthy competion.
[5:09:46] JeanDantez: Don't FFXIV and WoW fill somewhat different audiences
[5:09:49] schizowillie: Dude WoW is beat most realms are dead stop being delusional
[5:09:50] bakkich: They can take potential ideas fro FF tho, if the fit the style of WOW, which can be a good thing
[5:09:53] desmo7: wow stimulates final fantasy :p
[5:09:56] Streamcrush: Maybe Blizzard should be stimulated to make the game fun because the players deserve a fun game
[5:09:57] theoriginalzinng: i played ff14 back in 2013 apparently
[5:10:01] Thoreya: ud think FF would have better viewership literally anywhere too
[5:10:05] Shinjuro: way more
[5:10:06] jamarky23: Yeah cause FF14 is a Niche MMO believe it or not
[5:10:09] ThaOriginalGamester: you couldn't pay me to play FF LUL
[5:10:10] Kleipd: final fantasy had a pretty bad start tho, so they have been growing i'd say
[5:10:10] vision42g: ff owner made their devs play wow to get ideas KEKW
[5:10:12] Hayquel: Depends on what "coming for wow means to someone"
[5:10:12] Broomba: 2014 AAR
[5:10:15] Khlaro: 8 years since the reborn
[5:10:18] EggwithEdges: I think new player experience on FFXIV is bad
[5:10:29] swordart_19: I smell fanatics in chat
[5:10:31] Sleepy_Platypus: its community's love? @Towelliee
[5:10:35] schizowillie: Fun lol
[5:10:39] Cibaninja: Hmm, FF finally surprises wow about the time FFVII Remake Intergrade releases.....  The game is good though.
[5:10:44] Ohdies: regular content updates lol
[5:10:47] Kerzor1996: are there bonus rolls in final fantasy ? KEKW
[5:10:48] Shinjuro: @Towelliee 30 september 2010 was the release date for the original date when it came
[5:10:49] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Instant mounting, that should be a thing in wow
[5:10:49] Cibaninja: surpasses*
[5:10:59] Shadypies: yeh somethings wrong
[5:10:59] Tanaros: The FF story is cool to play through but after that there's nothing interesting
[5:11:00] Ki_Ki_01: It wasn't the Store to kill Rift, players could live with it, it was classes impossible to balance
[5:11:04] Speshulist: Truthbomb, they need to do away with DBM and systems like that.  It forces fights into these way over-complicated events that can only be done with said addons

[5:11:09] Blazzerx: HAMMERS UP POGGERS
[5:11:16] swordart_19: @kimmo_gaming that would look strange hmm
[5:11:24] jamarky23: I feel like the FF14 fanatics are on a massive crusade atm trying to expand their borders
[5:11:25] YardRage: are you in battle stance? you have to be to use overpower
[5:11:31] Streamcrush: every five? lmao that's optimistic for Blizzard
[5:11:51] Arazu_: what WOW need from FF is Devs relationship with players .)
[5:11:54] Kleipd: just now there was a dodge
[5:12:07] Kleipd: it won't display if you out of battle stance if that is what you ar elooking for
[5:12:10] theoriginalzinng: its not a wow killer, its just something different to play while im bored with my nearly min/maxed mains and now alts in wow
[5:12:26] Shadypies: exactly
[5:12:29] mwchaos: truuu
[5:12:40] epiczplz: shout out it towelliee truth
[5:12:46] LSBreed: How do you think Blizzard could turn around perception of Shadowlands.
[5:12:51] Shadypies: imagine how many developers were on the sette watching telly instead of developing the conduit system
[5:12:52] theoriginalzinng: 100% coming back for 9.1 whenever that is
[5:12:56] swordart_19: I just chill not problem with me xD
[5:13:13] Lornetc: Also, now they know what to do if there is an event that causes people to have to work from home from an extended period.
[5:13:31] Shadypies: and we get ion
[5:13:31] Layercake: The best thing in that article is that apparently Guild War 2 has more players than Roblox, and Wildstar still has players even that the the servers are offline and New World has a lot players , the game in not even out. LUL Cmon
[5:13:48] TheGaoSora: With the WoW community I don't blame them..
[5:13:49] Ohdies: I dont think the patch cycle is the problem but the lack of content available at launch. how many raids launched with tbc?
[5:14:04] swordart_19: Well I would not either KEKW bunch of toxic weirdos
[5:14:20] Shadypies: wonder why people have game rage so fast lol
[5:14:25] swordart_19: Some clowns on Twitter/social medial are mentally ill
[5:14:25] desmo7: we need ghostcrawler
[5:14:27] TheGaoSora: Also SE isn't bound by NA norms
[5:14:31] CDubTheRIPper: ff14 does promote a very friendly atmosphere
[5:14:41] EggwithEdges: Well, there's people telling others to spit on store mount users...
[5:14:42] just_kirk_: Toxic as in Asmonbald would curse them our everyday because his attempt at a mount failed.
[5:14:44] Shamwise: Shamwise subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 101 months, currently on a 101 month streak! For the Horde!
[5:14:46] bhxkazzam1: are we more toxic because blizzard doesnt talk to the community?
[5:14:56] swordart_19: towHorde
[5:15:02] Dixietwist: FF is just as toxic if not more so then wow in my experiance
[5:15:03] Tanaros: FF use to have a very wholesome community but as it's become more popular it's community has started to become toxic as well
[5:15:10] brandon_tapartos: just need star citizen to be done :D
[5:15:17] swordart_19: @bhxkazzam1 speak in subjectivity not generalising
[5:15:30] Broomba: @bhxkazzam1 I would say wow community has more a -holes being experts
[5:15:43] LSBreed: @towelliee That's true for the wow side of bliz. Hearthstone team is out there a lot Iksar (lead) is always doing AMAs and stuff.
[5:15:47] Shrenko: @Dixietwist no way
[5:15:47] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:15:49] theoriginalzinng: @Tanaros whenever i encounter a toxic person in ff14 i ask them if they played wow lol
[5:15:52] Shadypies: smaller communities are better
[5:15:56] CDubTheRIPper: damn LUL i havent played ff14 in a while
[5:16:08] Tanaros: @Tanaros truth
[5:16:15] Syllvn: That's not true at all. I have played 400 hours this year, not a single toxic person have I met.
[5:16:17] swordart_19: OMEGALUL who plays like that
[5:16:23] Speshulist: problem is it's an MMO.  It's supposed to be a lot of people
[5:16:23] Blazzerx: is there still layering in tbc?
[5:16:32] jamarky23: In raiding enviroment smaller communities are better indeed
[5:16:48] theoriginalzinng: man i remember this area on day one of tbc
[5:16:49] swordart_19: @blazzerx try with someone?
[5:16:51] theoriginalzinng: what a shitshow lol
[5:16:59] dokor: @Towelliee you have to be in battle stance for it to light up
[5:17:01] heavymetalhorns: I really miss Warhammer. That was my favorite MMO during that time period and I'm sad it's not around anymore FeelsBadMan
[5:17:05] YardRage: you're in battle stance right? can't do it in zerker
[5:17:07] swordart_19: That means you are landing hits KEKW
[5:17:09] ThaOriginalGamester: some people don't like The Hammer Squad showing up on Azuresong 😑 they liked their small server i guess lol
[5:17:16] Kleipd: i feel like a lot of people should stop relying on wow to be the only game they play nonstop without running out of stuff to do at some point
[5:17:20] epiczplz: you dont have too
[5:17:34] epiczplz: you have to over power the mob that dodged though
[5:17:42] jamarky23: @Kleipd  100% agree
[5:17:46] swordart_19: Just read what it does!
[5:17:48] dokor: @Towelliee just swap to battle stance when a mob dodges you
[5:18:08] theoriginalzinng: @kleipd agreed, im never looking for a wow killer... im just looking for game suppliments lol
[5:18:10] Eesay: @Towelliee It procs, but you have to stance dance to battle to use it
[5:18:13] Kleipd: @Towelliee it only blinks once when it comes up, other than that you have to pay attention to it or get a weak aura to tell you if it's up
[5:18:18] Thoreya: i do wish these content creators would just shift to FF fully and move on from wow
[5:18:25] Ponickz: @ThaOriginalGamester i never had anything but nice comments from other guilds
[5:18:26] swordart_19: Never overpower
[5:18:32] Thoreya: bc we fucking get it u dont like wow
[5:18:38] Speshulist: you have too much hit LUL
[5:18:49] kimmo_gaming: Too much hit rating, no one dodged yet Kappa
[5:18:50] Moobot: TBC has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch!
[5:18:52] Broomba: @thoreya how about content creators just go away
[5:19:00] swordart_19: You are just good at hitting stuff xD
[5:19:00] spainard15: It doesn't matter what stance it will proc and light up
[5:19:03] Valdur359: @Towelliee You have to be in battle stance to see the proc
[5:19:10] TheGaoSora: it has a casino though Kappa
[5:19:10] Kleipd: certain abilities are greyed out if you are not in the right stance to use it
[5:19:15] Wulfenst: Wulfenst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! wow has no content lol
[5:19:18] supersuhmz: some of the best content in ffxiv is the main questline
[5:19:25] LSBreed: @broomba but then we lose towelliee...
[5:19:27] Speshulist: enemies just aren't dodging.  I see Parry, Miss, etc.  No dodge
[5:19:30] Layercake: LUL If any of the wow content creators shift to FFIV ...their career will end
[5:19:37] Broomba: Why do we need content creators?
[5:19:38] Kinghorn: coxHypers
[5:19:52] Ariea_Whisper: They always come back or play both @towelliee
[5:19:53] schizowillie: What content does wow have besides beat end game raids?

[5:19:59] stratiss: depends on the content, sure no mythic + but theres a ton of other content
[5:20:05] Tanaros: FF is horrible for content creators viewship
[5:20:11] Layercake: Just look at twitch ....Streaming FFIV is just a career killer
[5:20:18] TheGaoSora: it's all depends on the host and how much he's toxic towards other games
[5:20:18] croppeast: same as BDO. Only fun thing with BDO is GvG
[5:20:23] Sam_Nash: I like it but you're right
[5:20:24] SexWhen: i quit becouse its not open world, zones saparated by loading screens ..... wtf japan
[5:20:27] Mazerbeam: WoW is super boring to watch. It's more about the player
[5:20:33] Wulfenst: @Willeaze nothing the same as FF
[5:20:34] kissesaurus: I watch those channels to fall asleep. Like a bed time story :P
[5:20:38] Speshulist: ok he just dodged and I didn't see it
[5:20:44] Streamcrush: WoW isn't that exciting to watch either, but it has certain personalities that have managed to make it interesting to watch them
[5:20:51] mmo_kenna_: ESO is the same, great to play through the stories but you don't want to watch someone else spoil them
[5:20:57] LSBreed: @broomba but he is.. When Wow lacks content towelliee moves to other games and stuff. He just doesn't rage about it because he's diversified..
[5:21:14] spainard15: it has to dodge yes, and it does not matter what stance
[5:21:15] swordart_19: I think it should
[5:21:28] Broomba: @lsbreed towelliee is a gamer not a creator of content

[5:21:44] TheGaoSora: just watch the ff14 channel, just look at all the content Kappa
[5:21:44] Broomba: His streams is content
[5:21:47] Speshulist: you definitely dodged
[5:21:52] Thoreya: wows been a top 10 game streamed on twitch for its existence..its more than just the streamer
[5:21:56] Zeltheir: Does overpower show it's proc when no in battle stance?
[5:21:56] Kleipd: overpower will proc in any stance, but unless you are in battle stance it will be geyed out
[5:21:58] Speshulist: or the mob did
[5:22:00] luckfore: damn questing is rough man
[5:22:01] Thoreya: gotta give the game a lil more credit than that
[5:22:10] Wildside1177: @Speshulist His target has to dodge.
[5:22:21] Wulfenst: How?
[5:22:25] Layercake: There were more people in the 1st five minutes in Max stream during the last world 1st race in wow, that during the entire FFIV raid race organized by Method.
[5:22:30] Wulfenst: Theres literally nothing to do in WoW
[5:22:32] TheGaoSora: True... chilledSadge
[5:22:35] Cibaninja: TBF, how many people switch from a game because of burnout, boredom, etc. and people equate that with "they hate the game"....
[5:22:36] spainard15: The Mob has to dodge, when the mob dodges or person. Then the proc will happen and you have to switch to battle stance and use the overpower.
[5:22:36] Wulfenst: outside of raid
[5:22:36] ColdChillXI: cant beat time
[5:22:39] Speshulist: @Wildside1177 did you see the clip?  he did
[5:22:41] YardRage: I gave up on Shadowlands way earlier than any other expansion
[5:23:14] EggwithEdges: Shadowlands concept seems cool, but atm execution isn't up to it
[5:23:14] Thoreya: ^ that was me with wod
[5:23:17] Speshulist: @Towelliee if you check out that clip, the mob dodged and it didn't proc.  not sure why
[5:23:17] swordart_19: @willeaze well you can push raid,m+,PvP as challenge stuff to do.Then do farming MOGS/petbattles/achievements collecting and such.
[5:23:17] Thoreya: and bfa
[5:23:22] catlinv: @Towelliee Seen that LostArk relase date?
[5:23:22] Shrenko: I really dont like where retail is going
[5:23:24] luckfore: yea its because of the drought
[5:23:24] swordart_19: They took awayuh gear
[5:23:28] TheGaoSora: Assuming 9.1 onwards will have good content, will you keep playing TBCC once it's finished it's content cycle?
[5:23:28] DiranJei: same, I was out within like 2 months. Which felt a lot earlier than other expansions
[5:23:36] Mazerbeam: Shadowlands (9.0/9.0.5) has a super short tail! And this has been the longest patch cycle in WoW history
[5:23:41] mmo_kenna_: I was hyped for covenants and then I was setting a table for a tea party.....who signed that off???
[5:23:47] Wildside1177: @Speshulist Yes there may be something odd happening but Overpower is nbased on the the mob dodging not Towelliee.
[5:23:49] swordart_19: Where is my gear where is my farming for few hour straight BabyRage
[5:23:50] Thoreya: i stopped bfa after the first month for a bit bc 8.1 was literally the worst patch ive prob ever played
[5:23:51] luckfore: we shouldve been in 9.1 2 months
[5:23:55] luckfore: ago
[5:24:01] hnti86: mounts Kappa
[5:24:02] Thoreya: bfa 8.1 was utter dogshit and made me bounce
[5:24:02] Cibaninja: what is skill number 5 on the action bar?

[5:24:08] AMDFusion: content drought in early patches..oof
[5:24:26] Tanaros: I play FF for the story then ditch till next expac. Theres nothing to do after but stand around playing with outfits like everyone else
[5:24:26] LawnSpeaker: They need to overhaul the expansion format
[5:24:52] Shadypies: i got 10 alts at 60 and love em all, but this repeat again n again taking its toll ;p
[5:24:56] Ballavar: legion grind best grind
[5:24:56] swordart_19: Give me back Artifact Power
[5:25:03] EggwithEdges: WoW needs more "filler" content
[5:25:12] thoooom: Unpopular opinion : I miss trial of the crusader
[5:25:24] swordart_19: @eggwithedges I play for power grinding mostly
[5:25:42] Ballavar: @thoooom you are right, it is unpopular.
[5:25:43] TMMOOF: oh shoot, Tow gonna catch up to my main on his alt LUL
[5:25:49] Layercake: They remove artifact power...they removed the grind...its pretty simple
[5:25:49] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:26:00] draken4o: for me the covenant system is what ruins shadowlands...
[5:26:07] swordart_19: @layercake part I loved PepeHands
[5:26:15] EggwithEdges: @swordart_19 yea, eg. Artifact power grind could work as that "filler" content. I mean just like something to do after raids etc
[5:26:51] swordart_19: @draken4o cause guide told you to pick X and y KEKW
[5:27:05] Notsure770: Last expansion is like stepping in dog poo on a freezing day.  Warm and comforting at first, then you slowly realize its dog poo
[5:27:07] Tanaros: I just miss making sure the turtles get to water SirSad
[5:27:10] LawnSpeaker: I think they should try to make an expansion that feels more like the classic levelling experience
[5:27:21] Kleipd: 🌊 🐢
[5:27:30] swordart_19: EXACTLY NO SWAP Pog
[5:27:53] impossiblesoul: @LawnSpeaker yes plz
[5:27:57] Kickapooh: your also an orc, so axe should be nice with your racial
[5:28:06] luckfore: blizzard themselves surely cant be happy with the current state of the game right?
[5:28:08] 6all: I would prefer not giving players skills/abilities via items or things like covenents
[5:28:12] Zeltheir: @Towelliee Are you sure the weakaura displays overpower's proc when not in battle stance?
[5:28:18] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker wut? did you even leveled in Shadowlands something
[5:28:20] YardRage: run awaaaaay D:
[5:28:22] draken4o: @swordart_19 no dude.. cus i want to try and have fun playing all those new cool abilities.. Not even because of "the meta"... WHy should i make second char same class .. just to try 1 new ability.. its stupid
[5:28:24] Back_To_Styx: KEKW
[5:28:39] Riddlz: LOL
[5:28:43] Speshulist: Want me to come over and sick pet on it while you wail on him?
[5:28:48] swordart_19: @draken4o well dude same logic applies for another class
[5:28:49] xDrakoor: help me stepguard xD
[5:28:50] Riddlz: heroic leap
[5:28:53] Riddlz: :P
[5:28:55] urangebirge: LUL
[5:28:59] LawnSpeaker: @swordart_19 yeah, why? You think that’s like classic?
[5:29:09] draken4o: @swordart_19 ye but.. u dont reroll another class for.. just one button..
[5:29:13] EggwithEdges: Damn that boar wanted you dead
[5:29:19] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker Don't speak about something you didn't do KEKW
[5:29:20] Cliffhoof: 45 Rage spent for a miss and resist, warrior life right there LUL
[5:29:27] LSBreed: @towelliee maybe take overpower off your bars and put it back on from spell book? that shit should have procd
[5:29:41] buckshot_feast: I can't figure out how to get it to show either
[5:29:46] LawnSpeaker: @swordart_19 I just said I did... balance and shadow
[5:29:55] Kleipd: @Towelliee overpower procs, but it only lights up while you are in battle stance
[5:30:05] LSBreed: macros don't light up
[5:30:06] Kleipd: so you have to pay attention to it yourself
[5:30:13] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker tell me difference between two then
[5:30:20] Kleipd: the macro doesn't affect it
[5:30:21] Speshulist: well you should be dodging a lot with a 250 axe skill
[5:30:33] Kickapooh: but you would think your WA would show it
[5:30:51] LawnSpeaker: @swordart_19 ... are you drunk?
[5:30:56] LSBreed: @towelliee bind macro to key and bars so you can see it light up.
[5:31:15] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker nah I love challenging what people say
[5:32:10] eQo6: The spell description says requires battle stance
[5:32:14] EggwithEdges: Where that boar came
[5:32:23] LawnSpeaker: @swordart_19 okay... so it’s not a real question then
[5:32:24] swordart_19: Ha there you go chat @eqo6
[5:32:25] LSBreed: @towelliee stand in front of the boar
[5:32:27] XenoqHD: No, has to dodge your attack
[5:32:27] Speshulist: boar can't dodge from behind right?
[5:32:32] Kickapooh: no only your attacks
[5:32:37] LSBreed: @towelliee less likely to dodge fr behind.
[5:32:44] EggwithEdges: there was dodge
[5:32:46] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker you can't say how it is different between two.
[5:32:50] EggwithEdges: no Overpower peoc
[5:32:52] EggwithEdges: proc*
[5:32:56] rpgpro24: ya i saw yellow dodge
[5:33:03] Wildside1177: I don;t think it will work in berserer stance in TBC. Could you using a macro from a later expansionm?
[5:33:32] Jamalamadingdong: the button will not ever light up in zerk stance, regardless of procs
[5:33:47] Kleipd: guys, the macro doesn't affect it, it's him not being in battle stance that makes it so it doesn't light up
[5:33:52] Wildside1177: It will never proc in berserker stance.
[5:33:54] LawnSpeaker: @swordart_19 nobody who’s played both would ask that question
[5:33:59] Kleipd: @Wildside1177 it iwll
[5:34:06] Kleipd: *will
[5:34:07] dokor: @Towelliee you have to set up a weak aura to have an alert while in zerk stance, otherwise you won't see it
[5:34:25] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker see you say something and can't even explain it, what a legend
[5:34:28] Jamalamadingdong: it will PROC but the button will never light, not sure how many times that needs to be said lol
[5:34:35] Kleipd: ^
[5:34:56] swordart_19: it light up now

[5:35:22] Kleipd: it just won't show upo
[5:35:28] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker Seems no one ever challenged you on what you say LOL
[5:35:29] Zeltheir: Wonder if there's an addon that will show if procced in other stances
[5:35:31] dokor: @Towelliee it procs in zerk stance, you just don't see it
[5:35:37] hildebrandyr: It will proc and then you will see the highlight if you swap to battle
[5:35:42] Esperz: Once you see a dodge you an switch to Battle stance and Overpower will be usable
[5:35:48] SavageELC: check your expertise rating
[5:35:49] Kickapooh: it'll proc, but it won't show that it proc'd unless you are in the appropriate stance
[5:35:51] mattyd812: It does proc, you just need to keep your eye out for the "dodge" then quickly swap over

[5:35:53] EggwithEdges: But Luthos weakaura didn't show it either
[5:36:05] Kleipd: @Towelliee as soon as you see the dodge above their head in zerk stance, use the macro, it will work
[5:36:30] swordart_19: that sounds annoying xD

[5:37:25] Jamalamadingdong: finally
[5:37:26] dokor: @Towelliee you can see the proc in zerk stance with a weak aura that tracks dodges
[5:37:39] Kleipd: PogChamp now he got it
[5:37:44] LSBreed: it's not tracking the buff properly
[5:37:54] swordart_19: @lawnspeaker you said what if it was similar to Classic I fail to see on what so I asked :P
[5:38:12] shawnmsmall35: We will have to have a talk with that WA author
[5:38:37] grizzlyhorn: i think it doesnt track it because its not a buff with an id

[5:40:08] grizzlyhorn: like if you pop bloodrage, it becomes a trackable buff at the top of your screen, overpower is just that its usable after a dodge, so i dont think the wa can tell when you get dodged to tell you that you can use overpower
[5:40:14] LSBreed: ah, lux missed that.
[5:40:47] LSBreed: it should show you as a buff
[5:40:52] Kleipd: i think 3-4 seconds?
[5:40:55] Tru7h_Reclaimer: Is it worth the loss of rage switching stances?
[5:40:58] Jamalamadingdong: it's short

[5:51:23] Zeltheir: The only problem I've ever had with Razer is the mousewheel on my old naga got a bit finicky, but I think that was just from gunk in it after using it for like 6 years LUL
[5:51:29] fewyn: i can't find any mouse other than the naga that i actually like... i do really like the corsair keyboards though
[5:51:48] DelcoAF: whaaaa?
[5:52:04] Snabido: F
[5:52:13] Wulfgrym: bastards
[5:52:14] swordart_19: F
[5:52:18] senifil: Every Razor mouse I've owned broke after a short while. Never had issues with logitech however.
[5:52:19] SavageCheez: I always have been curious about using a pad, but was skeptical about purchasing one
[5:52:41] MatsHartvig: how come?
[5:52:43] MatsHartvig: ah
[5:52:47] NispyCriblet: promotins
[5:52:48] Ballavar: moneys higher elsewhere
[5:52:50] swordart_19: @savagecheez can't you try for two weeks and give back?
[5:52:59] Paladine_Dragonslayer: I just never seem to have luck with Razer mouse buttons. Love the mice, hate the buttons
[5:53:01] SavageCheez: I guess I could
[5:53:03] Lornetc: I liked my Naga, but i prefer my Scimitar because I have giant hamhocks for hands.
[5:53:15] WarWalrus321: Never had problems with logitech mice
[5:53:22] EggwithEdges: Oof
[5:53:24] Syllvn: It's still a fairly fresh field, so people move around a lot as new jobs open up
[5:53:28] fewyn: the naga just works for me
[5:53:29] Lornetc: the naga was so tiny.
[5:53:32] Leroy_Elroy: gpro wireless?
[5:53:33] R2RHIN0: I only use Razer Mice
[5:53:39] Juppen: I hate the corsair app, maybe they changed it but a switched back to Razer a few years back
[5:53:44] EggwithEdges: My G600 broke after 5 years
[5:53:45] Wulfgrym: Well bois, no logictech mice here
[5:53:48] swordart_19: I got hyper X keyboard:P
[5:53:52] SavageCheez: I've been using a Logitech G9x mouse forever
[5:53:53] Rodom81: Rodom81 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 110 months, currently on a 110 month streak! 
[5:53:56] DelcoAF: stop getting your chicken juice all over it lol
[5:53:58] FAIL0ZOFF: TBH is there was just a honest peripheral company that does not spend money on thousand youtubers/streamers/marketing but rather focuses on making proper quality equippement
[5:54:19] FaceMcShooty: nah i have everthing from logitech and that mmo broke on me after 4 weeks xD so i bought my first naga
[5:54:21] Zeltheir: I used Razer mice for like 8 years before trying anything new
[5:54:28] EggwithEdges: If it works, why change? :D
[5:54:30] FaceMcShooty: *mouse
[5:54:30] LawnSpeaker: My Logitech mouse started double clicking after 6 months... seems like a common issue
[5:54:36] LosingWithStyle: not spending money on marketing is LITERALLY waisting tax money
[5:54:55] FAIL0ZOFF: marketing costs a TON of money, so yeah, it does have impact on final item price
[5:54:55] Syllvn: Making good products does NOT equal sales.
[5:55:02] Wulfgrym: as an older gamer, i also have owned so much razer stuff, that I'm sort of just a fan of their stuff before anyone else, corsair is 2nd now.
[5:55:05] swordart_19: true
[5:55:07] R2RHIN0: Have you ever used a Corsair Keyboard? I love mine
[5:55:50] Summix: Oh snap a fresh 60.  Is this #2 or #3?
[5:55:52] Lornetc: Im currently using corsair, but when I wear them out, break them, spill diet coke on them, i switch them out.
[5:56:02] squirmyjay: DId you guys do Kara yet?
[5:56:19] SavageCheez: I switch from a Logitech G15 board to a Corsair K95. The only issue I had was getting used to the smaller keys, but it's a great board
[5:56:25] tripl3heart: Logitech has bad parts man, steelseries and razer are so good

[5:56:26] Zeltheir: I've used the scimitar for a while, the only problem I have with it is the mouse wheel is kinda bugged
[5:56:42] Speshulist: I love my Deathadder v2 mouse and blackwidow chroma
[5:56:42] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:56:43] Gigawat74: I have had my razor stealth for like 8 years
[5:56:49] ThaOriginalGamester: chat thinks companies are in the business of making quality, long lasting products? LUL look up planned obsolescence
[5:56:53] FAIL0ZOFF: Got corsair kb K63 i got it for cheapo and it is working super nice, its 5y old now and very little to no wear, tho my ctrl broke and they send me 4 ctrls for free ;D
[5:56:55] Lornetc: My dad has an original deathadder still works like a charm.
[5:57:00] Frask81: Same thing that happened with your scimitar happened to me with the Naga towCry
[5:57:00] sifer007: LULW
[5:57:02] Holysal: thats how my nagas went. 3 in 4 months lol
[5:57:02] jerexify: @Towelliee That's my experience with Razer Naga, unfortunately. I freaking love the feel of the mouse, but I went through 3 of them in less than a year, and I just couldn't do it anymore.
[5:57:13] Shadypies: what u doing with them masturbating with em lol?
[5:57:13] catlinv: My Corsair keyboard survived my Chicken Juice Kappa
[5:57:15] mwsoldier: I've always had the best luck with razer and logi mice
[5:57:16] R2RHIN0: wow that's some serious bad luck, I've had my Corsair Strafe for like 5 years now with no issues
[5:57:18] Paladine_Dragonslayer: I love Death Adders...but they dont like me
[5:57:19] just_kirk_: I won some HyperX headphones from you 8 years ago and they are still perfect. Ordered one of their Keyboards because the headset was so nice and zero issues.
[5:57:22] ColdChillXI: Too much man
[5:57:25] fewyn: got to think about the number of hours you use the mouse too per day
[5:57:32] Gigawat74: My razor is freaking old. Works great lucky I guess
[5:57:33] fewyn: you use it a lot more than "typical" users
[5:57:47] Zeltheir: I feel like Razer's like QA or something is just a lot more thorough than other companies
[5:57:54] fewyn: yeah i totally agree
[5:57:58] Shadypies: haha no shit
[5:58:02] LawnSpeaker: @fewyn a lot of people use a mouse all day for work
[5:58:05] fewyn: i used to go through non-razer mice like every 6 months
[5:58:09] Shadypies: stomping them mouse buttons
[5:58:09] tripl3heart: mouse is like 2/3 years and then replace
[5:58:17] total_ez: my left click is acting up on my scimitar
[5:58:20] SavageCheez: I can''t program my brain to use a MMO mouse. Thankfully the K95 has 18 macro keys
[5:58:25] Shadypies: right clicks with a hammer LOL
[5:58:42] josephrt10: @Towelliee  Have u tried  cool masters ?
[5:58:43] DelcoAF: bro that's the mouse using AI to learn you... it's an upgrade
[5:58:58] DelcoAF: LUL LUL
[5:58:58] tehrobtar: i've been using red dragon for mice recently and they're pretty great... and the keyboard that my bf bought is amazing, as well
[5:59:01] LosingWithStyle: I do love my scimitar, but I don't like it's software
[5:59:07] R2RHIN0: Razer Synapse is the best by far. iCue is Meh
[5:59:09] RedDeadFredd: the new iCue is pretty dope
[5:59:17] 5gz_5g: "software" agreed, hard ware tho mhmmmm not so much
[5:59:26] FAIL0ZOFF: i dont see a reason to use MMO mouse, even WoW doesnt take me more than 2 keybound bars( ofc with modifiers and all) but still
[5:59:43] ReezyRx: Anybody try any of the Glorious mice?
[5:59:45] sipilde: I have a simitar and for some reason the OS keeps bugging and i have to reinstal it. happes like once a week
[5:59:48] Zeltheir: Yeah I think Razer Synapse is a bit more user friendly and straightforward than other softwares
