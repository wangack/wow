[1:16:17] CriticalPhil: CriticalPhil subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 71 months! 
[1:16:20] SorionTheGinger: can you solo q for islands now btw?
[1:16:26] Aeylid: dont think so
[1:16:32] Ramstein: 👀 Islands sound awesome, can I still do them?
[1:16:43] Darthyrevan: islands ptsd ptsd ptsd
[1:16:45] Thunderbrew: Only reason to do Twisting is the mount for the Maw?
[1:16:56] kharnij83: the lack of Anima given on any thing mythiC + etc is stupid
[1:16:58] Aeylid: and we fucking chomped on that shit
[1:17:03] Aervyper: @Towelliee and even if you lost in Islands you still had a chance to get something...... TOrghast feels like they just ran out of time to stuff cosmetics into the content
[1:17:04] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[1:17:10] Aeylid: and then we was like "aight imma head out"
[1:17:11] CDubTheRIPper: crreamChonk
[1:17:15] Bayne77: blizz has a habit of instead of tweaking to fix something they entirely flip to the opposite end of the spectrum
[1:17:16] Bonedit: do u srsly get nothing? in between?
[1:17:27] EpicJune: gotta get those player engagement stats LUL
[1:17:29] Bonedit: at least soul ash?
[1:17:31] northcub: do you get Soul ash for completing Twisted?
[1:17:33] Aeylid: nope
[1:17:51] Thoreya: wow needs to develop something better than torghast...SL content is starting to get a lil stale imo
[1:17:53] Aeylid: you get 4 rewards one on each even layer floor. A pet, a toy, a title, a mount
[1:17:55] Aeylid: thats it
[1:18:09] Krait06: why????? wtf they thinking?
[1:18:11] 0nowtje: when you level an alt.. you have to do all of the levels 1 by 1.. its retarded tbh..
[1:18:19] just_kirk_: Not even a lot of gold.
[1:18:25] Medobolt: isnt there a torgahst event in a few days?
[1:18:26] Ramstein: @Aeylid that's awesome tho, i like pets titles toys and mounts, the best thing about WoW is collecting all those lol
[1:18:33] Aeylid: but its once
[1:18:34] Aeylid: thats it
[1:18:38] Aeylid: now that ive cleared layer 8
[1:18:41] Aeylid: ill never go back
[1:18:54] Ramstein: well duh, once I got invincible i never went back to ICC ramste2Lul
[1:18:56] SorionTheGinger: where my mythic + sets!
[1:18:58] MrGattz: the worst part is its not even hard to make rewards. they just dont want to add them
[1:19:03] Olivermikael: there shud be transmog for m+ too
[1:19:09] Medobolt: pvp has an elite mog too
[1:19:17] Aeylid: @Ramstein but farming ICC wasn't marketed as an expac feature
[1:19:22] cavi_XD: they put rewards in the shop, it just takes cash to unlock them mteaDDumb
[1:19:22] Aeylid: it wasn't hyped up like that
[1:19:22] Darkwield: time for a battle pass KAPPA
[1:19:25] moonscryer: until the mxt boxes go on the store we won't get decent looking mounts or things.
[1:19:25] bigshovels: bigshovels subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! Woot Woot!
[1:19:25] ShadyDax: true that
[1:19:34] Recording_on_the_grass: that would be too addictive towel
[1:19:36] MrGattz: tmog, gold, pets, mounts, titles, toys, more tmog. its not hard to have rewards they just arint there
[1:19:36] Boozehound: a single rare spawn shouldn't offer more rewardds than all of corriddors
[1:19:36] Ramstein: i guess ramste2Think
[1:19:36] Aeylid: torghast was marketed and was this big thing
[1:19:39] ShadyDax: mythic+ actually so hard and no much rewards there
[1:19:40] Kromede: lich king drops a expensive pet on normal Ramstein Kappa
[1:19:47] Ramstein: @Kromede 👀 ON MY WAY
[1:19:48] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[1:19:53] metavahn231: i liked bfa dungeons more
[1:19:55] Silverbrit: Luckily twisting coridors is a one time only gig
[1:19:56] Kromede: KEKW
[1:19:57] ciranidd: i can hope for 8 more layers in 9.1
[1:19:58] ArcaneMaki: Ion is just a bit passed his time.
[1:20:01] ciranidd: with real rewards
[1:20:13] papaheals: It is hands down the best expac in the game
[1:20:14] elfwyn20: do you get soulash from twisted corridors ?
[1:20:19] Olivermikael: shud be able to insta cap soul ash in twisting
[1:20:23] blvdxoxo: just gotta drag it out enough till tbc classic
[1:20:30] EpicJune: feel like the actual devs aren't given the time to do those things
[1:20:32] Xanctius: @EIfwyn no
[1:20:34] Kromede: monkaSoap
[1:20:41] cavi_XD: Small indie company can't recover...
[1:20:41] MrKray2: @towellie I am really hoping that there is much more planned for torghast as we unlock the campaign more
[1:20:45] Ramstein: monkaSoap
[1:20:59] MrGattz: path of exile has more tmog and its a free to play game
[1:21:01] elfwyn20: @Xanctius that sucks.. thanks mate
[1:21:02] piratechris: I dunno man, could be way worse I mean just look at Cyberpunk
[1:21:03] Sincline387: I'm hoping they continue to add rewards to torghast, so you'll have additional motivation to go back
[1:21:09] I_DoctorSatan_I: AOTC not worth now since there's no mount until last raid teir at the end of the expansion.
[1:21:10] Lichcult: And tbh the mount design just seems lazy...should be way cooler for 16 hr grind in torghast @towelliee
[1:21:17] HopeThePriest: Theres no covid card there entire team is setup to work remotly before covid and everyone was stuck at home from a customer perspective. They cant use that excuse
[1:21:21] Thunderbrew: Complaining about no rewards in Twisting Corridors seems like looking for something to complain about.
[1:21:22] Viettz: Wait what' swrong with this game right now? I thought SL is best expansion.
[1:21:22] Ramstein: @MrGattz it's also microtransaction ridden and is built on being a F2P game
[1:21:23] Thoreya: if pvp wasnt so good this expansion i wouldnt be playing nearly as much
[1:21:47] cavi_XD: cyberpunk will be like Skyrim. made into a playable game through community mods....
[1:21:59] Karsus79: @Towelliee Hey Towel, hellooo, u made me cry so much with that thing woth bolvar quest
[1:22:06] Thoreya: SL is not even a bad expansion, its just stale
[1:22:10] Masqerader: with AWC next week, i can see all that convoke and such getting kicked in the balls tuesday
[1:22:23] Viettz: SL prime time is over, PoE is coming out next week
[1:22:25] Ramstein: how is it stale it just came out bro relax KEKW @Thoreya
[1:22:41] swordwindgaming: pvp is fun when its a choice
[1:22:43] MrGattz: @Ramstein right, but you cant complain about it. its free and its not pay to win or progress at all. its understandable that their tmog system is paid. but we pay blizzard 15/mo and wow has 100x more players than poe. id expect there to be more rewards for stuff we do.
[1:22:54] Olivermikael: there shud be some insane wep transmogs from finishing m + 17s or something
[1:22:58] Buttscratchrr: thats the way to do it right now pvp for gear
[1:23:03] EyecuGaming: EyecuGaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 4 month streak! thanks for the entertainment sir!
[1:23:04] Thoreya: @Ramstein i mean its been like a month and a half...and theres not much more content coming out anytime soon
[1:23:09] Adam__Aster: D:
[1:23:12] Viettz: Just get pvp gear man, so u'll feel bad when u do more raiding haha
[1:23:15] Buttscratchrr: you can rank up pvp gear as well
[1:23:19] Masqerader: Blizzard - spamming pvp for easy 200 + loot = fine Blizzard a couple xtra pieces of loot from raids, and +1 loot from timing a key = too much LOL
[1:23:19] jbeastb: state of the game is bad... tanks in pvp... tanks in pvp because the gearing is so bad... it stinks
[1:23:22] metavahn231: its REEEdiculous
[1:23:23] Ramstein: @MrGattz except there is way more in the entirety of the 16 years of content, versus what, 3 in PoE?
[1:23:24] 0nowtje: @Towelliee i cant get mouse over SAC macro to work on raid frames.. can u share ur's
[1:23:26] I_DoctorSatan_I: RIP pogChamp
[1:23:29] LSBreed: that's kinda how it was back in BC though too.
[1:23:41] Ramstein: @Thoreya do you not know how game dev works? plus corona? KEKW

[1:24:12] Malarick: I gave up trying to get a wepon. I started PVPing
[1:24:14] Olivermikael: its not BiS for Pve
[1:24:16] Thoreya: if they change the loot system i hope they dont nerf pvp and make other stuff drop more loot
[1:24:19] jbeastb: @Towelliee I agree... my enhance shammy is sporting like 5 pieces out of pvp
[1:24:19] Elswango: you're just kina fucked if vers is bad
[1:24:24] swordwindgaming: reaching 1600 is a struggle without a buddy lol
[1:24:27] jerexify: @Towelliee Because even something as "low" as 1600 is out of reach to people who are god-awful terrible at PVP like myself.
[1:24:28] Kinghorn: vers is fine for resto shamans
[1:24:30] ciranidd: or now that the full set is unlocked, on alts just grind renown catchup and upgrade the set to 190+
[1:24:30] Karsus79: Pvp Gear is very good for resto sham
[1:24:33] Xanctius: I am just surprised that we havent really seen any changes at all yet
[1:24:33] Reepham: i cant even get 1400 Sadgeä
[1:24:46] Thunderbrew: Not all of us have an OP PvP friend to carry us
[1:24:54] MrGattz: @Ramstein nah poe has been around for a pretty long time. and also id argue poe has just as much content than wow does just in a different form. they also have a new xpac every 3 months that adds more and more content
[1:25:38] Ramstein: @MrGattz fair, but keep in mind GGG built the game with F2P in mind, to be supported with microtransactions
[1:25:42] metavahn231: this is the xpac of take what you can get
[1:26:01] swordwindgaming: thats a big part of what makes it disappointing so far
[1:26:08] MrGattz: yeah. i mean they gotta pay the bills somehow
[1:26:08] tvcuisinier: is he prot i
[1:26:30] JordanRose1993: yes towelliee is prot
[1:26:38] tvcuisinier: in this arena
[1:26:43] Ramstein: I don't see WoW ever being F2P but if it did happen, you can bet they'd sell more mog/mounts/etc. than are in the game now
[1:26:48] JordanRose1993: yes...
[1:26:57] tvcuisinier: wow
[1:27:23] propwash80: @Towelliee i do have to admit the xpac is fun. the dungeons are fun, the tower/corridors are fun, havent tried the raid yet but so far the game is fun. it just feels unrewarding
[1:27:47] MrGattz: i get that their main source of income is mtx which is why there is so much of it and it looks so amazing. and wows isnt mtx which is why we dont get a ton of it. its just an expectation that i think wow should live up to being that its the king atm

[1:28:01] I_DoctorSatan_I: I don't PvP or Raid (in current tier), so, my gearing is soley dependant on M+ which is getting stale for me at this point at 207 running 13 dungeons every week and attempt to inc IO. I just feel like a robot just endlessly grinding.
[1:28:05] ghosty299: How you get 220 items from PVP'ing ?
[1:28:19] Ramstein: that's just it, being the king is both good and bad, good because everyone loves you, but bad because you don't have to be competitive
[1:28:22] MrGattz: not that wow should have more mtx, they should just have more rewards in their system for the content that we do

[1:42:53] jbeastb: Enhance is fucking awesome... especially if you are a melee dps in thier grp lol
[1:42:53] Ramstein: @kharnij83 use WoWUp instead, works seamlessly
[1:43:04] cptrogers123: may i ask what is the best way to gear up as a tank?
[1:43:15] Ramstein: be the only tank @fillebergg ramste2Lul
[1:43:28] thebakeriscomingforu: kyrian ability helps a lot in m+
[1:43:32] Olivermikael: they need to make u more tanky and less healing
[1:43:35] bartemus_prime: what do you think about blood dk's for higher keys? Don't seem to ever see them this XP
[1:43:52] Ramstein: blood was #1 for like a week werent they
[1:43:58] thebakeriscomingforu: those 5 shields do a ton of damage and give you a big absorb if you have the talent
[1:44:26] Ramstein: monkaS
[1:44:27] Vigi9413: how hard was that maw mount to get
[1:44:31] dawntreader123456: how good are demon hunter tanks?

[1:45:26] SelfishJuggler: Blood just getting smashed :(
[1:45:32] jerexify: They may not be the best, but I've been having a great time as Blood DK this expansion. Granted, I don't push high keys, and am on a Heroic raiding team, not Mythic, but it's been great fun.
[1:45:36] Zyvuun: He's doing it just in case
[1:45:39] slipper14: @fillebergg do all m0's, try to get an armor stack group if you can - you should get a ton. Do PVP if you can to fill any missing slots, should get you to like 180, get lego - then run raid
[1:45:41] Casual_Oppa: why play blood when you can be unholy atm
[1:45:44] Forestrunner201: My wife is kinda pissed that her Prot Warrior she has played since Vanilla is so crap this expansion
[1:45:48] Manabucho: Im blood in raid im a litteral rag doll xD
[1:46:19] thebakeriscomingforu: prot warrior and blood dk will be better a bit later in the xpac
[1:46:23] SelfishJuggler: Did a SoA +9 on my BDK and VDH, i can tell that its like night and day between them. You heal alot with Dk, but you get hit for like 60% as much
[1:46:25] thebakeriscomingforu: more gear will help
[1:46:25] LexisCloset: my guild uses a BDK for mythic lol

[1:52:54] Masqerader: sanguine and TD was pure aids in bfa
[1:52:59] SorionTheGinger: oh come on - tol dagor sanguine quaking - best. week. ever.
[1:53:05] vetrlidi: @I_DoctorSatan_I Same... I really enjoy playing BM over MM
[1:53:06] Masqerader: especially since it was 45 seconds till that crap despawned
[1:53:52] danksly: kool with anything except necrotic and bolstering
[1:54:17] Amarlian: at least with a druid, they can soothe one
[1:54:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: @eiriksson I enjoy BM a lot, even mained BM in BFA, it just sucks we got the nerf hammer. Blizzard didn't really need to touch us tbh. I hate how this game "needs" to buff / nerf classes/specs to be "competative" or "oh, our turn now, bye bye BM Hunter spec, you had a good run in BFA!"

[1:56:58] vetrlidi: was MM even viable in BFA? i cant remember playing it at all... i think i was BM for the whole of BFA @I_DoctorSatan_I @MrGattz
[1:57:03] danksly: that one dropped it
[1:57:15] Masqerader: the worst is in Spires when u land from being carried and everyone spawns quaking
[1:57:29] MrGattz: nah mm wasnt really ever viable in bfa. maybe for a bit at the start but thats about it
[1:57:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: @eiriksson Yes, BM was the "go to" spec in BFA. Not many ppl were playing MM at that time.

[1:58:34] Antdavs24: @eiriksson it like tried to be for like a week when BoD dropped lol but thats about it
[1:59:23] I_DoctorSatan_I: Destro Lock was THE best spec to be in BFA. Still viable in SL, but Affliction just blows em away. Demo Lock...forget about it. Just play Demo if you like pets.

[2:16:01] tawney_owl_: how do you even get to that ilvl, and not know how to do a heroic LUL
[2:16:14] ch1rpz: People have to learn though. Not everyone is a pro gamer
[2:16:17] yadungoofed101: pride takes a minute, mini boss will take 2-3 mins

[2:17:18] tawney_owl_: @ch1rpz very true, but its strange when people are high ilvl and dont know the basics
[2:17:18] cptrogers123: may i ask what is the best way to gear up as a tank?
[2:17:21] snichy: Knowing tactics > DPS
[2:17:45] NecroLicas: yo
[2:17:54] Horseweave: is a matter of exposing themselves to the content

[2:18:17] yadungoofed101: you'd have to be killing pride now to time

[2:30:11] yadungoofed101: I am a brewer lol
[2:30:14] Senthius09: the perception of how much alcohol does because other flavors dull
[2:31:21] heavenz333: towRed
[2:31:58] yadungoofed101: You can bottle condition which is basically where you carb in the bottle where you could POTENTIALLY go up like a couple tenths of a percent theoretically since you introduced more sugars. But really senthius is right about perception of alcohol content.
[2:32:00] Mecabeast: I need to go get some mead had a great peanut butter and jelly one awhile back

[3:02:15] D3m0nHunt3r666: the other day I saw someone getting booted out of 12 for being BM LUL
[3:02:21] SorionTheGinger: @Veramer actually the oposite .. if you bring good players the class doesnt matter - but bad player on great class? thats bad
[3:02:28] smashwow: keys are hard because people don't/won't interrupt or use their tool kit. every class can go in M+

[3:03:07] slipper14: @SorionZ That just isn't true, top tier classes are just better - though you can't bring actively bad players. I'd rather an OK hunter than a arcane mage, etc..
[3:03:08] metavahn231: stack enough hunters with rsham and veng DH and its easy mode, bring Pal tank and some destro locks...welcome to dead key
[3:03:10] smashwow: just like right here the group is basically a meta comp. but they're struggling because of the player

[3:03:37] Masqerader: he got farted on in otherwords
[3:03:53] WoW_StandalonE: thats why good pvp players r gold in mythics, they know their class cc and other nice utility
[3:04:00] pereadin: this hunter is trolling the key
[3:04:02] metavahn231: the specs are just way too unbalanced to even consider player skill at this point
[3:04:05] slipper14: By OK players I mean does mechanics but probably not playing class at 100%
[3:04:08] pereadin: he's doing like negative damage for being a hunter
[3:04:12] SorionTheGinger: @slipper14 also - for keys as low as 15 it literally doesnt matter what you bring - go to 20, yeah now ouy want the proper line up
[3:04:18] smashwow: a good player period would know that. pvp or pve
[3:04:50] WoW_StandalonE: pvers r not used to cc, unfortunately
[3:04:51] slipper14: Ehhhh IDK, I invited a feral to my +13 NW and we barely timed, definitely not inviting ferals in future
[3:04:58] Masqerader: Oh nice I got a some necroray egg from my calling, free mount in 3 days yay
[3:05:04] Masqerader: @Towelliee lots of caster mobs
[3:05:05] SorionTheGinger: @slipper14 and you know it was a god feral?
[3:05:06] slipper14: Though there were obviously some other issues too.... but he had 3.6k dps
[3:05:09] yadungoofed101: highest mists have been done this week
[3:05:18] slipper14: Well your average player by definition isn't a god
[3:05:18] smashwow: and i've seen ferals do 5k in a key and everything be fine
[3:05:30] yadungoofed101: apparently plaguefall is an easy timer this week
[3:05:44] pereadin: I know how to cheese that area in Sanguine Depths
[3:05:44] Wildside1177: It is amazing that every person in chat is a pro player. Amazing! lol a lot of people being critical because it is easy to be.
[3:05:46] Getitonthelow: best wow player is quin69
[3:05:49] Masqerader: sanguine gauntlet + necrotic, grievous etc = dumb
[3:05:51] SorionTheGinger: you didn't bring a bad class .. you brought a bad player @slipper14 - that is entirely my point

[3:06:10] Bugszy: hall way towards last boss its too narrow
[3:06:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: have they done any nerfing this week UL
[3:06:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: LUL
[3:06:16] Klauzzer: KomodoHype
[3:06:20] slipper14: Feral have an insanely weak damage profile for M+ IMO, even a god tier can't keep up with a fire mage, mm hunter, boomy, etc...
[3:06:24] theoriginalzinng: it literally is the new tol
[3:06:26] CoffeeNeko_972: towPog towPog
[3:06:46] slipper14: Can you time a +15 with a god feral, sure - but if you're pugging you have to assume players are close to average, so better to bring classes that pump
[3:06:51] Masqerader: my favorite part of gauntlet with grievous is if u die and res u somehow end up with your stacks of grievous lol

[3:06:54] SorionTheGinger: @slipper14 their damage profile is enough ... you don't NEED god tier classes if you just have 5 people that are good at their class
[3:07:06] WhizzleTeeTz: WhizzleTeeTz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:07:06] metavahn231: in M+ you need specs that can do it all, doesnt matter what you parsed in your heroic raid
[3:07:08] mrniceguy817: @slipper14 Insanely weak because they don’t keep up with the top 3 haha
[3:07:26] smashwow: and good != god tier. you can time 10s and 12s with 3.5k overall

[3:07:29] slipper14: Well exactly, I'd rather bring just meta classes - you get enough to apply for high keys why bother with others
[3:07:48] SorionTheGinger: thats an entirely different point ...
[3:07:54] slipper14: If it's my key I'm not inviting a feral and hoping that they surprise me in a good way.
[3:08:22] WoW_StandalonE: last boss is easy now after nerf
[3:08:28] Affiiance: The last boss here got nerfed into the ground
[3:08:49] SorionTheGinger: you keep moving the goal post ... the discussion topic was "bring the player not the class" and that is entirely correct and sufficient for 15s - if YOU want to bring the class, thats your thing but not what we were talking about initally
[3:09:05] mrniceguy817: I tank the last ball near the edge of the circle makes it ez for me anyways
[3:09:07] Affiiance: Like a week ago I think
[3:09:08] WoW_StandalonE: last week
[3:09:09] Tigerklaue: weeks ago
[3:09:10] metavahn231: whats wrong with this boss, it aint no SD second boss
[3:09:18] Bugszy: we just did last boss was the easiest in the run
[3:09:42] tbakm: it's definitely not "nerfed to the ground" all they did was help reduce the chance that abilities overlap
[3:09:53] MrTahmm: Dont twisting corridors yet?
[3:09:55] smashwow: and if you chose to bring the class over the player. you are continuing the mindset meta is the only way to do a key. which is far from the truth. even for average players
[3:09:57] MrTahmm: Done*
[3:09:57] Tigerklaue: ill go 4 high keys and the other with quick 10
[3:10:26] slipper14: Yea I guess what I'm saying is - why ever bring a non-meta class when you get 10+ hunter applying to every +14/15 posting.

[3:10:35] metavahn231: poor specs only time if they are overgeared, this is blizzards fault
[3:11:10] Templexx: waddup peoples
[3:11:25] Mecabeast: the only time class is important is if youre pushing leaderboards and playing in the middle. otherwise just bring the player.
[3:11:45] Mecabeast: *mdi
[3:11:56] SorionTheGinger: ^this
[3:11:58] pereadin: Hunter did negative damage
[3:12:05] Crystalyzee: he was potatoe for 220
[3:12:06] Masqerader: are they in pvp gear?
[3:12:11] SorionTheGinger: look at that - meta class hunter did dissapoint
[3:12:17] pereadin: The hunter should have done like 5k overall
[3:12:17] Slimbo82: link it
[3:12:18] Cosmolus: gear in m+ and raid are so shit
[3:12:25] Joyman79: well if it's full of pvp gear, doesnt help that much
[3:12:29] MrTahmm: Which trinket?
[3:12:30] Veegore: Did you finish off your twisting corridors?
[3:12:37] Tigerklaue: no one is doing m+ for gear mostly for the vault
[3:12:41] metavahn231: that hunter was a poor player but still contributed cause of spec
[3:12:46] ChillLouie: Next run complete a key
[3:12:47] officerbeardog: Pog
[3:12:59] Powerofwar_1: so how do mythics work like how do get the keys
[3:13:08] Cosmolus: it's fucking ridiculous how people have to do pvp to fill the spots left empty by raiding and m+

[3:13:46] ChillLouie: You get in one and when done you get a key brother
[3:13:53] Getitonthelow: I need that gear
[3:14:07] D3m0nHunt3r666: I do it for some minor upgrades
[3:14:08] Joyman79: well, you do m+ for gear in the sense that you do it for th vault item, which is gear too
[3:14:15] josh8555: @powerofwar_1 you change your dungeon difficulty to mythic do a 0 and get a key after you complete it
[3:14:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: its a good learning curve, but feels more of a pain than rewarding
[3:14:56] Naturalbeef: People are still in BFA loot mode.

[3:15:03] smashwow: the vault is awful compaired to say the pvp vendor
[3:15:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: Vault would be better + bfa style drops
[3:15:12] Cosmolus: it's ludicrous ... people should not have to do pvp to get gear for pve....
[3:15:15] Joyman79: i think the only problem is that pvp gear is way too good and high ilvl vs raid/m+
[3:15:16] Wildside1177: The vault is good but the amount of gear from activities like M+ and raid is too small.
[3:15:18] Gapz: @Towelliee The vault being on its first iteration is pretty good imo
[3:15:20] ninedraft317: its better then what it use to be
[3:15:38] ChillLouie: And the more you do it. The vault will reward you with a key and a choiceof gear
[3:15:50] Krusznokh: Krusznokh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[3:16:17] tbakm: "only 2 were upgrades" oooooohhh noooo what are you to do. that is already 100x better than the old system
[3:16:21] ChillLouie: The vault has rewarded me greatly ya bugging
[3:16:23] piratechris: Doing PvP to be able to do PvE... now that i Burning Crusade all over again
[3:16:47] raldrik: better than week after week of nothing or mastery corruption
[3:17:17] necralia: they need to bring back badge vendor for m+
[3:17:24] gimmlay: I Get what your saying but u cant be handing out mythic level loot all day either, reason why bfa was garbage
[3:17:29] ChillLouie: Do they give you bonus roll tokens in this xpac?
[3:17:33] Affiiance: Low IO Boomies are so bad LUL
[3:17:40] ChillLouie: Havent been able to find that
[3:17:57] gimmlay: need a valor or item upgrade system imo
[3:18:15] smashwow: i'd be down for valor again
[3:18:41] smashwow: then allow upgrades based on pve prog
[3:18:47] smashwow: solved
[3:18:48] Rictamar: FFXIV does tomestones, similar to valor, you can buy gear from a vendor after getting enough tomes
[3:18:48] smashwow: ggs
[3:18:50] Rictamar: much better imo
[3:18:54] souplordtv: I dont get why it isnt back already with pvp vendors
[3:19:38] Aro725: yeah but what if versos was your worse stat as pally? the pvp vendor would suck.
[3:19:42] brazkat: but if you add upgrades how would you have it work for pve gear? similiar to pvp? rating/highest key = upgrade to X IL>?
[3:20:22] souplordtv: youd just do it how justice/valor was before
[3:20:26] gimmlay: ye exactly braz
[3:20:32] souplordtv: and do some alterations based on key level
[3:21:03] Affiiance: This Shammy probably bought a 14 carry XD

[3:29:56] metavahn231: how have they not hotfixed loot yet lol
[3:30:21] Squats3: @Veramer because the way loot is distributed right now is intentional.
[3:30:22] Aro725: 233 is 2400
[3:30:28] Murlock07: jesus
[3:30:42] Masqerader: mythic + 1 extra piece of loot = broken, spam pvp and buy rating = fine
[3:30:43] metavahn231: @Nelothi doubtful
[3:30:54] D3m0nHunt3r666: just get him a good dinner @Towelliee Kappa
[3:31:02] metavahn231: pvp being better for gearing than mythic raiding is an oversight for sure
[3:31:17] Squats3: just go read some articles.. watch some interviews with ian. loot scarcity is intentional.
[3:31:18] zinbers: That where I play at area 52
[3:31:33] griffdog125: lol pvp is also broke with all these 1 shot mechanics n disc priests
[3:31:42] its_bean92: @Nelothi its intentional but pvp loot is way too easy
[3:31:51] ForgottenTime: @towelliee lmfao he’s in my guild
[3:31:52] metavahn231: loot isnt scarce the distribution is unbalanced and broken
[3:32:02] Decoyszn: What do you mean “and disc priests” lul
[3:32:03] Getitonthelow: what's fastest way to get to 2100
[3:32:06] Squats3: pvp gearing isnt as good as ppl say it is. youre capped to 550 a week which isnt even 1 main slot item. the only time its better is for getting weapons. which is fine
[3:32:16] swordart_19: @Getitonthelow being good 4Head
[3:32:19] Dillhouse: @Getitonthelow win
[3:32:27] metavahn231: if you dont pvp you dont get loot its so busted
[3:32:35] Decoyszn: @itsbeantv no it isn’t lol
[3:32:37] Getitonthelow: welp, that's a negative for me 🙅🏾♂️
[3:32:37] ManneehFresh: sucks for people who have absolutely no interest in pvp.
[3:32:39] Squats3: hot take- pvp

[3:33:36] LoremasterMarthan: Where does one even go to "buy" someone to carry? Asking for a friend lol
[3:33:48] Decoyszn: You can’t really carry right now
[3:33:54] Decoyszn: Meta game doesn’t allow it
[3:33:58] Ballswagger: once you get up to that rating do you have to continue playing to be able to upgrade the gear?
[3:33:59] Aro725: how do you say they get all the loot?they get maybe one piece a week or 2 if they have to save 875 conquest.
[3:34:01] Mecabeast: if only you liked ret heard its one of the strongest in 2s atm
[3:34:07] SilkeySmooth: you can get carried to 2100 east
[3:34:11] SilkeySmooth: easy
[3:34:12] Decoyszn: @ballswagger one win a week
[3:34:12] Aro725: most papers are 200-208 ilvl

[3:36:33] Decoyszn: Thought you meant WITH PvP @gabesiggy
[3:36:38] swordart_19: no one will waste hours of trying for 3 item lvls .

[3:37:59] Rictamar: people coming to a WoW stream to complain about WoW...get a grip @SilkeySmooth you clearly hate the game
[3:38:00] GabeSiggy: @ItsDecoySZN but its because my friend groups were geared and we needed a healer so i rolled one
[3:38:13] yadungoofed101: @SilkeySmooth because in the end you still suck, like all these other pugs that have high io and ilvl because they got carried
[3:38:28] SilkeySmooth: dont get mad because im calling it out
[3:38:43] AJRowland90: @silkeysmooth if you are the kind of person that needs to pay to get decent gear etc you shouldn’t even game, you probably don’t even take notice of tactics during carries 😂
[3:38:43] Decoyszn: @swordart_19 and if you aren’t gonna explain it, then next time don’t aggressively go after someone and hide afterwards.
[3:38:48] imsorryaboutwhatisaid: Chat, is he kyrian or venthry?
[3:39:01] yadungoofed101: I think you're calling it out because you dont have gold to afford a carry every now and then but other people can

[3:42:18] Decoyszn: Or some people just need to stop being pricks
[3:42:27] metavahn231: pve players should probably get to gear as fast as pvp players do...in pve lol
[3:42:30] LORECRAFT64: first time ive actually enjoyed pvp tbh i usually just kill dragons
[3:42:33] surprisetrex: @Towelliee is taking the First Avenger talent ever worth it over Crusader's Judgment in M+? I'm Kyrian if that makes a difference.
[3:42:40] yadungoofed101: LuL
[3:42:43] Affiiance: Hell yeah lol
[3:42:44] Cosmolus: Pvp is good the way it is. PVE is the problem. PVE player should not have to do pvp go get gear xD
[3:42:55] Bounty4321: @Towelliee Most of us PvPers want PvE loot to be better?
[3:42:59] Aro725: fax
[3:43:03] D3m0nHunt3r666: less bots to play with LUL
[3:43:08] srze94: @Towelliee make resilience great again!
[3:43:13] Decoyszn: Yah, I wish it was better for PVE’rs
[3:43:15] swordart_19: No wonder chat is full of BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage when Towellies is on BabyRage BabyRage moood bye chat.
[3:43:16] deadb0lt_: @enryu_mazino I 100% agree with that. having to grind honor to get decent weapons felt so weird.
[3:43:31] shale93: for years PvPers had to PvE for gear now that it is other way around for once just let them have it lol
[3:43:34] Decoyszn: @swordart_19 dude what is your toxic ass problem? Grow up
[3:43:41] Wildside1177: It is not "casual players" - is this M+ over and over loop fun to anyone? ANYONE? It blows.
[3:43:44] Bounty4321: No PvPer in their right mind wants the PvE loot to remain the same, it's going to kill the player base.
[3:44:06] Decoyszn: Exactly Bounty
[3:44:07] Cosmolus: @deadb0lt_ imagine doing 10 keys and getting 2 items and 1 of them is literally unusable. That was me last week
[3:44:09] griffdog125: lol only way to gear is vault and pvp. raid only drops anima lol
[3:44:19] manmower: you should ask for more PVE drops, not ask them to ruin a PVP gearing system they are starting to get right lol
[3:44:28] herrapertti: you absolutly dont have to do pvp for good gear, its just makes it faster. pvp players get gear faster aswell doing both
[3:44:29] Decoyszn: ^
[3:44:31] Ariea_Whisper: @boomeranng125 agreed hahahahah
[3:44:35] yadungoofed101: @boomeranng125 those fat 35 anima drops though
[3:44:43] Veegore: Don't talk about binding shot... i had a hutner binding shot a bunch of mobs in sanguine last night. feltbad

[3:44:46] Bounty4321: PvP Gearing is great, they NEED to improve PvE gearing... simple as that really.
[3:44:50] metavahn231: have you seen the official forums?
[3:44:53] HotHotHeals: Arena>Mythic Raiding
[3:44:55] mrpresbaby: are they back from vacation yet?
[3:44:59] mrpresbaby: or perma vacation?
[3:45:00] Affiiance: Omg the crying about having to play the whole game is hilarious
[3:45:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: It won't make it past 9.1.5
[3:45:13] Aro725: PVP just don't want there loot to change. PVE loot needs to be fixed asap
[3:45:24] IxProNoobxI: pft I run dungeons and raids for anima, what is gear even look like?
[3:45:26] duhworks: with pve loot being this bad on the edge of quitting the game
[3:45:28] D3m0nHunt3r666: blizzcon is gonna get slammed :P
[3:45:36] metavahn231: complaining about raider io
[3:45:36] Decoyszn: @affiiance you’re missing the point entirely, and it’s not “crying”
[3:45:38] herrapertti: if u want the gear FAST you pvp and raid/m+ but u dont need to do both if u dont want to, it just makes gearing faster for both players
[3:45:44] Bounty4321: @Towelliee I made a post on the forums asking for them to respond to the loot and reward scarcity problem in PvE... hopefully it gets a response lol
[3:45:50] Mecabeast: just need valor tokens to buy dungeon gear implement key rating like mmr for upgrades and bring armor tokens to raid
[3:45:53] Rictamar: PVP isn't mandatory, don't do it if you don't want to
[3:45:55] Jokervenom1978: I dont play wow to pvp myslef
[3:45:57] MrGattz: i get it, its just not balanced. pve needs a vender as well.
[3:45:58] peywon123: Yes and they didnt fix that problems for 2 expansions either
[3:46:04] SadDingus: remember when pvp gear was only good for pvp
[3:46:09] Chrissfrosty: there should be balance no mater what u do. just incresse with diffectly
[3:46:10] deedeemegadoodooo: should add some sort of pve vendor
[3:46:13] Wildside1177: Sooner
[3:46:15] jbeastb: bro... PVP gear is WAY to ez to get compared to PVE gear
[3:46:22] Affiiance: Im an everyday casual AOTC PVE'r and Im loving jumping into PvP here and there to get gear
[3:46:29] MrGattz: way sooner. they need to fix it like within the next few weeks
[3:46:32] imsorryaboutwhatisaid: !addons

[3:46:33] Rictamar: I agree though PVE needs a vendor, WoW's biggest competition does this and would solve problems with no getting gear you want
[3:46:37] epiczplz: ya hitting 1800 is kinda of a joke
[3:46:57] Xrudee: chat, how did he get that cosmetic back? =)
[3:46:58] PoppaShot: Thanks to whoever gifted me a sub I was asleep lmao
[3:46:59] ManneehFresh: pvp is not easy if you have zero interest in doing it .
[3:47:00] Bounty4321: @Towelliee The post I made on the forums to ask Blizzard to respond to these issues and their plans is mostly being respond to by people saying "loot is fine" lol. When me as a PvPer is asking them to fix this shit and at least TELL US what is going on
[3:47:10] WSeveryn: @Towelliee are PvE'ers upset that their is no vender like PvP has?
[3:47:22] Affiiance: hitting 1600 takes almost no effort and that gets a PVE'r Heroic ilvl gear. Its balanced right now if you ask me
[3:47:23] reinhardtdog: Honestly I miss more loot dropping and even the rng to it. Just cap the dang mythic level of raiding as best gear in game.
[3:47:37] Decoyszn: @epiczplz no it’s not, actually takes skill and time
[3:47:39] ManneehFresh: no effort for you.
[3:47:47] Lostdogal: NO more vendors though, ffs, give us stuff to do to get gear, not just grind the same shit and collect tokens
[3:47:49] surprisetrex: @Towelliee is taking the First Avenger talent ever worth it in M+? I'm Kyrian if that makes a difference.
[3:48:00] Decoyszn: @affiiance that isn’t true at all 🤦🏻♂️
[3:48:10] Liverstad: Is the problem that you dont recieve enough loot or not the RIGHT loot? Should there be some sort of conquest point currency as bad luck protection?
[3:48:15] newtothepound: show talents after plz
[3:48:21] manmower: @reinhardtdog probably have to make the high end pvp gear the highest ilevel, since it is more exclusive than mythic raiding
[3:48:26] Getitonthelow: how long does it take to get 1600 gear
[3:48:35] Affiiance: @ItsDecoySZN It is bc I have actually done it so I know how bad some ppl are that get to 1600
[3:48:47] Decoyszn: @affiiance what’s your armory then?
[3:48:49] Wildside1177: @Affiiance What about people who hate PvP? We play the game to have fun not do horrible chores.
[3:49:01] Decoyszn: @getitonthelow you get 1 piece every week to two weeks depending on the slot
[3:49:41] Jokervenom1978: Im loving everything about Shadowlands EXCEPT the lack of gear. Im a casual AotC raider and Im feeling less inclined to play.
[3:49:41] Affiiance: @ItsDecoySZN sent it to you
[3:49:50] raspaqq: the only issue comes with raid and m+ amount of loot drops,everything else is fine,u dont have to do bgs for gear,next week u can literally get full 197 with anima just like u can get 197 with honor,casual gearing is fine,competitive gearing sucks for pve
[3:50:00] MrGattz: @Wildside1177 +1 i hate pvp. i dont want to pvp so that i can get 200+ loot so that i dont get kicked out of +7 dungeon pugs.
[3:50:10] FosSiLiTate: Ritual of Woe monkaS
[3:50:31] jerexify: And hitting 1600 is not "easy". I promise, I'm god-awful terrible at PVP, and will NEVER be 1600.
[3:50:36] jerexify: Without paying for a carry.
[3:50:54] Wildside1177: @MrGattz I understand why it helps but this is a game. I do not want to log in to do something I hate because there is no choise. There is a choice. Cancel sub.
[3:50:56] D3m0nHunt3r666: gonna be close
[3:50:57] Masqerader: 7 minutes let, might not make it
[3:51:01] D3m0nHunt3r666: but you got it
[3:51:01] Masqerader: I WAS HERE
[3:51:17] Masqerader: all for 35 anima
[3:51:19] TheVigiliance: 35 anime! Oh yeah!
[3:51:20] necralia: LUL
[3:51:20] Decoyszn: @affiiance are you a pvper? I think you’re overestimating the normal causal player base. It’s kinda rough right now, and that is also coming from rank 1 players
[3:51:40] D3m0nHunt3r666: 15 NW EZ
[3:51:56] Sedoris: Necrotic Wake 15? Oof
[3:52:00] DocOaky: Its not bad, pretty forgiving timer honestly
[3:52:07] Bounty4321: @Towelliee Can I link to a forum post asking Blizzard to respond to the loot issue?
[3:52:10] Affiiance: @ItsDecoySZN No I am literally the only one in my guild that does any PvP at all, I did 1600 completely pugging with no voice comms
[3:52:13] DocOaky: We did a 17 with 2 full wipes and had 2 minutes left
[3:52:16] andTHISiswhat: whats ur fav dungeon?
[3:52:17] Masqerader: every mythic + needs their TD
[3:52:20] Towelliee: !permit bounty4321
[3:52:21] Moobot: @Bounty4321 will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)
[3:52:28] Rictamar: the problem is too many people Pug, if you join a guild you wouldn't be complaining about gear problems

[3:52:35] Decoyszn: @affiiance when did you do that?
[3:52:41] steelreign0080: as long as its not a PF Im good lol
[3:52:43] metavahn231: 15 shrine of the storm Pog

[3:53:36] OzzyBBQ: gold
[3:53:38] Tigerklaue: loot reward is a joke , anima reward is a joke
[3:53:45] pilhass10: twisting corridor was fun for a day LUL
[3:53:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: I rather get gold than anima xd
[3:53:50] crunch91: Twisting is a joke though,
[3:53:54] Affiiance: @ItsDecoySZN I am decent sure, but in 3s the people I was playing with werent even good sometimes
[3:53:54] IxProNoobxI: Yea I feel like anima should scale lol
[3:53:54] crunch91: not hard, just takes forever
[3:53:56] skdmaster: Well you do get that 1250 anima for the first twisting from bolvar
[3:53:57] zzllaazz: even if they gave like 2k gold from m+ finishing
[3:54:03] IxProNoobxI: 35 anima even in mythic raid lulz
[3:54:03] zzllaazz: at least its something
[3:54:03] LoremasterMarthan: THere should just be no realm of the game where you spend ~1 hour of your time and have nothing to show for it. Flat out.
[3:54:08] ciranidd: yea why cant there be at least a weekly quest for anima from TC?
[3:54:08] thebakeriscomingforu: if anima is a reward it should be 250 min. cause I can do a world quest and get that
[3:54:11] MrGattz: you spend 11 hours running a +17, congrats! here is your 35 anima and 1 piece of loot
[3:54:18] necralia: lol
[3:54:19] ManneehFresh: 35 anima when you neek 5k and 10k for all sactum upgrades. not worth
[3:54:25] andTHISiswhat: If everyone gets loot tho then the game would be given it to all
[3:54:36] gfield2k: I agree. But twisted corridor isn't a gear item level reward event. They specifically stated its for cosmetics @Towelliee
[3:54:41] Decoyszn: @affiiance just cause you did it, doesn’t mean every casual normal pve’r can. I promise you, it isn’t easy. Literal Blizzcon champions and AWC competitors comment on how rough 14-2000 is in this season right now compared to what it’s normally like
[3:54:43] steelreign0080: They can take some of the spell bloat out of the game and replace it with loot :)
[3:55:07] ironcarrot5327: What is the best hpal covenant?
[3:55:13] metavahn231: windwalkers got their second potency conduit thats why they pumpin
[3:55:19] Skizzurp: its fort so ofc trash stays alive and more to cleave onto
[3:55:22] Affiiance: @ItsDecoySZN well yeah you should have to work a little to get gear just like in PvE
[3:55:26] Etines4: That world quest trinket feels so good
[3:55:32] octnoir: There's like 4 of them right?
[3:55:33] Tigerklaue: the toy and pet LUL
[3:55:41] Grumperdoo: good question
[3:55:41] pilhass10: toy pet mount
[3:55:41] Orcmondo: i really love the toy!
[3:55:42] Veegore: that's the events on the calendars
[3:55:43] VictorAvalanche: toy and pet is not a cosmetic
[3:55:44] manmower: they need to make them
[3:55:45] gfield2k: Oh yeah okay you are correct. I haven't seen any lol @Towelliee
[3:55:45] pilhass10: tittle
[3:55:46] Ezekyler: patch 9.2
[3:55:47] thebakeriscomingforu: @ironcarrot5327 holy pally is kyrian
[3:55:50] ludzki__: a cosmetic is like a transmog set/wep not a shitty pet/mount haha
[3:55:51] Skaboy_TV: Random drop. 1% chance...
[3:55:54] SpreedyTV: 35 +
[3:55:55] Xailen: they are not not yet implemented I bet LUL
[3:55:58] Ardailec: 144 floors? Holy shit fuck that noise
[3:56:02] ManneehFresh: you think they had years to develope this expansion...oooh wait
[3:56:02] Veegore: The calendar event brings the cosmentics, i believe
[3:56:05] D3m0nHunt3r666: not implemented yet Kappa
[3:56:14] Sedoris: The rewards are.... very underwhelming
[3:56:16] Vindmolle: im hoping they add more rewards, because its extremely lack luster righ tnow
[3:56:19] instructOS: classic andrews
[3:56:23] Lostdogal: classic Andy :D love it
[3:56:25] LoremasterMarthan: There should be no realm of the game where you put in ~1 hour of time and have nothing productive to show for it
[3:56:29] Rictamar: Twisting Cooridors is so dumb, fuck the mount its not even worth it imo
[3:56:31] deedeemegadoodooo: or a masochist
[3:56:31] loragheta: the toy is cosmetic
[3:56:33] FattBeard: Tedious
[3:56:35] rocthenite: ytou defended bfa
[3:56:39] gfield2k: @Towelliee nah I don't argue. You make a valid point. I thought you were referring to it have gear. Context is everything lol.

[3:56:55] Freakzene: Wooons
[3:57:00] skdmaster: So the real question if that implemented cosmetics but you had to re-run twisting would you do it?
[3:57:04] ManneehFresh: and them it so unbalanced for alot of classes
[3:57:16] Gopher34: it's fun for me, i'm enjoing it (ele shaman)
[3:57:21] pilhass10: Just get good lol
[3:57:21] Veegore: my 183 guardian druid alt is rolling through layer 8 TC right now lol
[3:57:21] acklesdh: pet EZ Clap
[3:57:22] Vindmolle: thats rough
[3:57:26] crunch91: they need to learn their class then LUL
[3:57:30] ExtreemeCheese: I think there are some AMAZING things about this xpac, but they're being overshadowed by gear/twisting
[3:57:31] Rictamar: even for cosmetics it is a waste of time imo, other games to play, other things to do
[3:57:38] D3m0nHunt3r666: corruption LUL
[3:57:40] shale93: seen a person spending over 3 hours on a layer and then couldnt finish the boss lol
[3:57:46] LoremasterMarthan: You arent going to see them change anything about it until people finish up their collection of legendaries and the participation falls off a sheer cliff
[3:57:47] ishonbtw: Can confirm. As a shadow priest twisting corridor sucks.
[3:57:49] sross44: I did it last night to do the quest. Then was getting 2 shotted and couldn't finish. But found out you can leave and just do 6 floors to "find" quest items. NOT FUN
[3:57:49] pereadin: I just want the loot amount and ilevel drop from M+ tto be rescaled
[3:57:51] Mecabeast: I spent 2hrs doing layer one yesterday to fail on last boss cause bad rng for powers for the boss I had to fight
[3:57:52] Lostdogal: Torgast is sooo close to being great as well, it feels like they put actual effort into making it worse than it could be
[3:57:53] ciranidd: a weekly quest to complete any layer for 250 anima, at minimum, a recolor of the set perhaps, or another green set like the mail runner set
[3:58:09] Aro725: i liked corruption alot, not being alt friendly sucked but it was fun as hell to have 300 mastery
[3:58:11] Frankthemindsculptor: Or you spend 2 hours on a layer, can’t kill the boss and get nothing
[3:58:13] Sedoris: I like also, how people are like "It's like Mage tower tho!" But... mage tower didn't take me 3
[3:58:22] PhillyDilly18: Is the Maw Mount worth the difficulty and time consumption in Twisting Corridors Level 8? I assume yes probably...?
[3:58:24] SpreedyTV: and more loot in m+
[3:58:24] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[3:58:25] crunch91: m+ is actually useless now LUL
[3:58:29] TombStoneMercenary: Would they of been better off spreading the changes over the next couple expansions vs just dumping pretty much everything we knew in one and a half patchs?
[3:58:37] gfield2k: @ExtreemeCheese correct. It is very frustrating to run a mythic 10 an get 35 anima. At least make it 250 like what you get from the world boss
[3:58:47] ExMachineGamer: there should be gear reward also on the tower
[3:58:49] thebakeriscomingforu: visions were better than torghast
[3:58:50] Veegore: I prefer to do M+ over raiding anymore, but doing top M+ is less rewarding then H CN so what's the point
[3:58:51] andTHISiswhat: prob is they trying to implament something from diablo 3 and trying to make it fit someway... Yes the rewards should be better
[3:58:59] Aro725: 220
[3:59:04] steelreign0080: @Towelliee is that a table add on?
[3:59:04] Senseo_nl: What addon is that ?
[3:59:05] gfield2k: 220
[3:59:07] BanteringGnomes: What is that you use for your mission table?
[3:59:12] thebakeriscomingforu: you could get loot, materials, pets, mounts, and set your own difficulty
[3:59:27] crunch91: its real time
[3:59:28] Affiiance: We know what showering everyone with gear gets us... BFA
[3:59:31] crunch91: not game time
[3:59:36] MFAM_THE_Steven: 24hr from the time you chose the last
[3:59:38] Decoyszn: @crunch91 have you played every class, you do realize it’s wildly different right? some classes have it rough in Torghast
[3:59:41] Veegore: yes, their duration is from when you start it
[3:59:44] realnzall: @Towelliee anima flows last 24 hours, but you can choose a new one at daily reset
[3:59:44] Lexi__Marie: all i want to know is why does it cost anima for an anima mission
[3:59:44] peywon123: mythic 10 gives 220 in vault so
[3:59:45] Mecabeast: what if bmah items could drop in twisting corridors?
[3:59:47] Reydien: it's powered for 24 hours from when you click, but the ability to click resets at normal time
[3:59:50] xstraightbrutal: @Towelliee based off the time you chose it.
[3:59:51] BanteringGnomes: Anyone know what the mission table addon was?
[3:59:58] gfield2k: Can you explain how that works @Towelliee, the anima conductor ?
[3:59:59] Senseo_nl: @Towelliee what is the table addon u use ? :)
[4:00:00] psycothedruid: psycothedruid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 19 month streak! mornin
[4:00:02] TombStoneMercenary: @Towelliee Do you think they tried to implement to many changes to fast and got overwhelmed?
[4:00:04] Draz3nx: how do you unlock the other ones?
[4:00:05] Skaboy_TV: The red line is 24 hours, but the ability to set it happens on reset.
[4:00:09] Reydien: your ability to empower is reset-based
[4:00:11] Skaboy_TV: So you can hvae 2 up at once.
[4:00:12] Reydien: but the effect is 24 hours

[4:01:31] loragheta: i beat layer 8 like an hour or two ago and im a fucking filthy casual
[4:01:32] Ichimonka: Rogues cant even do normal torghast properly :D
[4:01:33] Veegore: Best advice for TC i have is this: Fish for a skeleton layer to start, buy the ravenous orb and use it on a skeleton for almost infinite phantasm

[4:02:20] nevdennett: Was wondering why it didn’t pop up with another quest
[4:02:23] Decoyszn: @foxies_havocing no it works exactly like Torghast...you have to do each layer
[4:02:32] griffdog125: as rsham. had perma last every 30 secs and a permanent elem. with earthquake. was nice 👌
[4:02:33] Sylnus: maximumHelpme pumper checking io,social security and bank balance

[4:03:28] bigbearjackson: I've been helping folks get through torghast on my resto shaman but twisting is getting tough
[4:03:31] Decoyszn: Everyone needs to realize different classes and specs perform better in a Torghast setting or they perform worse. Just cause you can do it, doesn’t mean another spec can
[4:03:36] warclouds: why does everyone suck from, Ragnaros @Towelliee
[4:03:39] Nightz101: hope he blows the dung

[6:07:30] thiccsushi: I only do the callings because they are like 2.5k gold a day
[6:07:45] regalbeast: yeah but if you HAD to do it there would be complaining as well
[6:07:57] Finarato: They should have made it ridiculously cheesy and fun i don't think we would mind
[6:07:59] RonnieHwan: WAIT 144 FLOORS?

[6:10:01] piratechris: Agree there is just nada to get out of Torghast
[6:10:03] regalbeast: I agree with that
[6:10:07] kashmara: No, I agree. The state of loot is totally shit.
[6:10:07] skdmaster: Do you even get a title of some sort of the tower?
[6:10:08] MOLAR305: 4g thats it
[6:10:16] KaisenSiru: Good
[6:10:17] Tinypeanut: Not asking for much, even some T-Mog would be acceptable at this point lol
[6:10:23] duncon: green BOEs :D
[6:10:49] kreloril777: its kinda fun
[6:10:49] regalbeast: hopefully it's just the first iteration of twisting corridors
[6:11:09] Syllvn: Feel like they ran out of art resources to do it
[6:11:13] SwissSteveW: 3 gold 4Head
[6:11:14] HitStreak: That mount is great but yeah, I'm not super excited about spending 14hrs in there to grind it.
[6:11:15] MasqureMan: Gaming comes down to rewards at the end of the day
[6:11:17] thiccsushi: 3 gold PogChamp
[6:11:19] Vivelli: sounds better than m+ with 35 anima
[6:11:21] LocoPollo1: 3 gold PogChamp
[6:11:21] Finarato: Plus there should be some reason for replayability
[6:11:31] HitStreak: At least Islands gave you AP
[6:11:32] Celestian_GC: Islands are WAY faster.
[6:11:35] RonnieHwan: i gain loads of skinnig materials lol
[6:11:38] Rulem: what if it was 25k gold? I would rather it be gold than gear
[6:11:38] piratechris: You're not wrong
[6:11:42] ciranidd: i mean gimme 100g to pay my repairs lol
[6:11:43] Wicked_0: I've only done torgast for legendary and now that I got them I don't go there much
[6:11:51] HitStreak: and you could come out with currency to get another chance to get a mount from Islands
[6:11:52] holst23: i wonder what the torghast thing in the calender next week is

[6:11:54] swordwindgaming: Blizzard wants you to burn lots of time
[6:11:59] ventu105: Guys Frost Mage are good choice for dps?
[6:12:01] Stormrazer78: 3gold > 3anima be happy man
[6:12:08] larres2g: Doing torghast to get my Bear legendary aswell
[6:12:11] nightmayor12: you also didnt end up with nothing if you didnt successfully complete an island
[6:12:11] GodKingMuninn: @ventu105 LUL
[6:12:12] SwissSteveW: Mage tower was great
[6:12:15] skdmaster: Thats why I am waiting to do the tower - in case they add in stuff - I can get around the maw I just hijack a ride for now
[6:12:16] Firedexx: so if they add stuff to TC in a patch would you go back and redo it?
[6:12:17] Thewraith077: @Towelliee I think the worst part was going through all 144 floors.. no soul ash.. then having to go do 2 more 8's
[6:12:19] SwissSteveW: Loved the rewards
[6:12:20] ijuki: @ventu105 Currently it is worst dps... go either arcane or fire
[6:12:21] Aeylid: hulk bear best bear
[6:12:28] HitStreak: I'm SO glad I worked to get my Mage Tower done
[6:12:29] ventu105: Ok
[6:12:33] duncon: FOMO for sure with mage tower.
[6:12:41] duncon: and i missed out :(
[6:12:44] piratechris: Get the mount and never go there again
[6:12:45] stosh1e: @Towelliee hey Im venthyr as well do you know how ember court works?
[6:12:54] torx_7: Viccus740 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[6:12:55] cyllos: I think they just didn't finish it
[6:13:05] I_DoctorSatan_I: the onyl reason why I go back to Torghast weekly now is just to collect Soul Ash to upgrade my 2nd BiS lego for my Hunter. That's it. I dont care about The Maw or some mount when you can kill one NPC in ~5 sec to ride one in the Maw.
[6:13:06] HitStreak: This has to be the first wave of Torghast content
[6:13:09] HitStreak: no way it's "done."
[6:13:09] Wicked_0: @ventu105 frost is fun but you want to get competitive i heard fire got a come back, i would check but yeah frost is fun
[6:13:17] larres2g: Are the different rooms in torghast on some sort of rotation?
[6:13:18] CozzyFlannel: i did Layer 1 and there is no way I am doing the rest of the layers. Not worth it. I would rather walk
[6:13:27] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @MadDogMadfes (warning)
[6:13:27] piratechris: We don't need more floors and layers in Torghast with shit to show for it
[6:13:32] RedChaosTV: hell the first 2 layers i did getting my mount, i got 10-15 place holder anima powers, that did nothing
[6:13:36] duhworks: is there a point to do the court?
[6:13:36] Syllvn: @Towelliee Cosmetics werent the OG plan for Torghast, so I imagine they didnt have time to make a load of new stuff and I imagine they didnt want to double up on rewards from other things
[6:13:55] oslow1337: can we get legendary in twisted ?
[6:14:08] HitStreak: They have to reduce that time commitment if they're not going to give you anything on those layers.
[6:14:10] Syllvn: Hoping 9.1 proves me right on that
[6:14:12] piratechris: They should have though more diablo like with Torghast and it baffles me that they didn't as far as loot goes
[6:14:12] regalbeast: but then we have to farm it forever
[6:14:12] raldrik: or atleast let the mobs drop normal stuff and boe's and such like the outdoor world
[6:14:18] MOLAR305: the current iteration has no replayability, because once you have the mount, whats the point
[6:14:22] hoyhoy007: true
[6:14:25] HitStreak: 1-2hrs in a layer is too long to give you nothing
[6:14:33] Thornsbury10: that would be awesome
[6:14:33] brazkat: @Towelliee what about a armor set similiar to how they did CMs
[6:14:34] Thewraith077: Like.. give me soul ash at least
[6:14:36] HitStreak: I don't even want to go back in there.
[6:14:36] ventu105: fire mage what covenant is good?
[6:14:39] SwissSteveW: Thers almost no motive to do it
[6:14:48] purplepillows: do I have to do all 8 layers this week?
[6:15:16] Dolfo3: i cleared 18 levels
[6:15:23] Finarato: @purplepillows no you have the rest of the expac
[6:15:28] hoyhoy007: maw of the maw rekt me at layer 18

[6:15:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: @stosh1e I'm Venthyr...The Ember Court is basically a mini side game to earn more rep with the Ember Court to purchase xmogs and Ember Court appearance. You will also go around SL areas to gain RSVP's to invite to you your court. You can only queue for your Ember Court senario once a week.
[6:16:20] metavahn231: why would they put storyline behind twisting corridors when most casuals have no chance against layer 8

[6:16:50] Nimz83: You can also get mounts from certain guests
[6:16:59] herc4evr: You can just go in a few hours later and get all 3 parts over 3 trips on floor 1 to 6
[6:16:59] HitStreak: Do you bother with the mission table, @Towelliee ?
[6:17:33] KnightmareFrame: Pretty dope
[6:17:43] Unrealsiege: @Nimz83 I think you need more rep with what ever guest to get a mount, been doing it all weeks and gotten the same green/blue rewards

[6:18:33] eastcoastcrumbs: dang. 3 hours until i can have a drink
[6:18:39] Hrurcf: What's the reason for the super early schedules now? @Towelliee

[6:24:03] Vivelli: oooh how?
[6:24:12] Fitty204: Why, because their agent could've made more commission?
