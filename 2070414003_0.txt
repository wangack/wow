[0:07:38] Kaekias: i don't like coffee
[0:07:44] Kaekias: also good afternoon
[0:09:36] Selecktt: @wileyecoyoted Come p3 I think locks will be pretty strong. unstable affliction and pandemic seems like it will make afflic the goto for pvp

[0:11:57] Naithxn: what would you recommend for PvE disc or holy?
[0:12:42] Selecktt: @wileyecoyoted I made a warlock recently because the last sentence in summon felguard seemed REALLY interesting. "The Felguard benefits from all talents and effects that trigger from or benefit ANY of your other Demon minions.". Leads me to believe master demonologist will make felguard give you increased damage, resistance, reduced damage taken, and threat.
[0:13:32] wileyecoyoted: @Selecktt sheesh Felguards wer already sick lol thanks for the input
[0:14:19] arianfiftyone: @Naithxn I tried both, sticking with disc

[0:48:23] Zenlyn: at the rate sod is going do u think it'll have more screen clutter than retail at 60+?
[0:48:44] Zenlyn: yeah

[0:58:43] hughjasses: to respawn
[0:58:47] Its_Ponti: Aah fair
[0:58:58] jujujay_myalias: Yeah once you are on your 5th lockout you should kill mobs and try to get a rare respawn
[0:59:08] jujujay_myalias: Until next ID is available

[0:59:40] Kiroxx: sorry to say

[1:31:29] hughjasses: i'm wrong don't listen to me
[1:31:39] Selecktt: It uses whichever one is higher for damage scaling, and will count as either shadow or frost damage, depending on whichever of your targets resistances is lower.

[1:31:43] Mystiggo: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/dual-spell-schools-explained-season-of-discovery/
[1:31:54] Mystiggo: Dual school spells scale from Spell Power of either of the relevant schools. In the case of Spellfire damage, that means that either your Arcane damage or Fire damage will be used, but never both. The highest of the two will be used
[1:32:11] rein1715: when you gonna turn in the wood
[1:32:20] amexpog: this farm is for some gnomer items?
[1:32:40] hughjasses: yeh so if you have shadow power > frost power it will never factor in frost power to shadowfrost
[1:32:58] Mystiggo: it'll also factor in resistances of your enemy and picking the lower one
[1:33:01] cole19: What are you farming? Grim-Encrusted Objects?
[1:33:01] Selecktt: ye pretty much just stack shadow sp. It does bypass shadow res stacking though.

[2:36:41] MrPoulpp: 90s then :P
[2:36:58] lerler: ure still using VP ?
[2:37:04] lerler: looks like TF is better
[2:37:56] lerler: really? interesting
[2:38:11] LogiTheBear: bless you
[2:38:14] lerler: i experienvced the opposite haha
[2:38:16] abrlol_: bless you
[2:38:38] lerler: On the priest discord it says this: "The last 4 bosses have 20% Disease damage reduction. Consider playing TF on 3, 4, 6"
[2:38:38] D3V015: void plague is also getting a 10% buff soon. will definately be better
[2:38:47] lerler: Not soon, it already happened
[2:39:24] lerler: so the change was Feb 20, imma check logs
[2:39:33] nighteye___: !addon

[2:40:55] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vm4aSwoKQ
[2:40:58] DietBeverage: anyone know what addons are used for the group list as well as the addon that shows healing numbers?
[2:41:18] Mystiggo: Snayr a big homie
[2:41:19] Selecktt: @DietBeverage Looks like default ui to me
[2:41:39] prodigy_wow: merp
[2:41:44] Deadelegy: Agreed, it's the one thing I don't like about item rack
[2:41:45] Leviosor: both are in game settings
[2:41:52] lerler: so hydra, from what I can see, rank #1 used VP but before change
[2:41:54] DietBeverage: oh nice
[2:42:01] lerler: rest of othe people in rank #2 and 3 are using TF
[2:42:12] Selecktt: 100 parse. good job.
[2:42:17] prodigy_wow: grey for sure LUL
[2:42:50] h3zky: the last 4 bosses take less dmg from disease
[2:42:50] hughjasses: 120 parse holy shit
[2:43:02] lerler: yeah so the reasoning is becuase you casting another MF is more DPS than casting a DOT
[2:43:07] net_worth: tf feels awful. non-scientific assessment
[2:43:09] Mystiggo: in a vacuum, on a patchwerk type fight, TF is like 4 dps more, depending on fight length as well
[2:43:22] lerler: I mean sorry, casting another Mind Spike is more DPS than casting another dot
[2:43:32] lerler: is what i read on the discord
[2:43:40] Mystiggo: but like so many fights have movement and mechanics, I just think VP is better on average
[2:43:43] lerler: maybe try a boss with it, and one without it
[2:44:00] Deadelegy: I definitely like this animation for mind spike more than the retail version
[2:44:01] lerler: the problem with VP is it doesnt line up correctly
[2:44:12] Mystiggo: also top logs being like 30-40 second kills on some of these bosses, TF gains some value in such a short fight
[2:45:05] lerler: that too, but yeah if you feel like VP is better by all means! i think the dps isnt that big of a difference
[2:45:10] nighteye___: whats the addon that shows the spells above his frame
[2:45:12] lerler: plus if youre moving around probably VP is better
[2:45:15] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[2:45:46] lerler: at least for me, i parsed low on the fights i used VP, and higher on the ones i did TF
[2:45:57] Mystiggo: On last boss the top 2 logs yesterday were within .4 dps and they were both using different things

[2:46:05] Mystiggo: they're REALLY close
[2:46:07] lerler: maybe try this boss with TF and see how it feels
[2:46:27] lerler: or more like do the DPS haha
[2:47:06] Mystiggo: 100%

[2:53:37] lerler: trolls have haste
[2:53:39] nabaschurus1: oh
[2:53:42] lerler: berserker
[2:53:54] lerler: u cant be lock troll

[3:19:26] epidemicttv: Good to know. I haven't done many BGs, but in STV the mage seems to be pointless as they die pretty much insta from a rogue. I will have to venture in to WSG/AB to see how druids and mages are while fighting them I suppose. Boomkin definitely seems like the strongest choice between the 2 in STV.
[3:20:07] epidemicttv: I had the joy of encountering you twice in STV so far on my gnome warrior (Invincible)

[3:46:33] fdaapproved123: reported for gdkp
[3:46:35] letsgetgoingyo: exchanging items for gold is whats not allowed
[3:46:52] NovacloudxD: 5g
[3:47:21] ImSeagullible: @letsgetgoingyo is that just for sod or what, feels surprising they'd do it now
[3:47:31] ImSeagullible: i dont really keep up with wow atm so idk
[3:47:49] letsgetgoingyo: @ImSeagullible its a phase2 major change, GDKP is now illegal
[3:47:59] fdaapproved123: exchange item for gold is gdkp
