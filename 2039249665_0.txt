[1:28:03] Aurelianus_Augustus: @N0t_Speedy if you want to grind the american air tree just  get the premium f5c, it is one of the best pre. vehicle in the game for grind
[1:28:08] N0t_Speedy: @Aurelianus_Augustus I feel like its a bit unfair that i have guns who cannot really penetrate Panthers reliably and they can just obliterate me

[1:28:44] Aurelianus_Augustus: @N0t_Speedy ahh you are grinding the ground, that is even more chaos, you need patience until abrams
[1:28:44] sidlo01: Hi tommy, idk if you know it but oversimplified release after long time second Punic war
[1:28:46] Vegasmcswagger: Imagine tommy playing dayz

[1:29:00] magicducky38: can't wait for npcs in this game, it will change everything

[1:29:25] appelflopper: @magicducky38 are they planning that?
[1:29:28] N0t_Speedy: @haix24287 Cheek is the box around the turret right?
[1:29:30] banane1784: @sidlo01 do you prefer part 1 / 2?
[1:29:42] Recyclops_22: dayz would be awesome
[1:29:44] Happyknight7: you don't know anything about dayz
[1:29:51] magicducky38: @appelflopper yup, staged implementation. So animals come first
[1:29:51] Aurelianus_Augustus: @N0t_Speedy american ground tree is trash until the modern tanks unfortunately, study your enemy and go for the weak zones, for german tanks go for the turret cheeks
[1:29:53] sidlo01: banane1784 I did not see it yet since I wait to see it idealy with tommy
[1:29:56] ct0460: @n0t_speedy That flat ass piece of armor yeah.

[1:30:28] appelflopper: arent there like runners and stuff as well?
[1:30:28] hiltskywards: cant wait for build 42 in 10 years :D
[1:30:29] ct0460: @n0t_speedy Don't shoot the rounded part of the turret cause the 76mm is kinda meh and you'll just piss of the panther.
[1:30:36] Forkayylmao: ok Gayge
[1:30:37] 0BlackSmoke0: @N0t_Speedy Get the Jumbo then the Panthers can't really pen you easily either. As for how to deal with a Panther, best way is to take the gun out and use your MG on their tracks so you can get to the side
[1:30:41] PabloTescobar26: "That's really dumb" as he proceeds to do it GIGACHAD
[1:30:48] sidlo01: Hi @TommyKayLIVE , idk if you know it but oversimplified release after long time second Punic war
