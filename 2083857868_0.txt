[2:12:38] ParfumAmerican: they are trolling you lol , you can wikipedia it
[2:12:40] daijahaden: It's supposed to be zainy and over the top. It's more a celebration of the different European cultures than a legit music competition.
[2:12:41] taylorsdank: GREAT movie on netflix that parody's it. Will Ferral stars in it.
[2:12:43] snikiwii: u should play cha cha cha xd
[2:12:43] TodBobertson: @xolossus00 If he was your "favorite streamer" then giving him $5 wouldn't be a "waste"

[2:12:57] skeetooljko: Not true. A long time ago ABBA won it.
[2:13:01] Mister_Ript: @Reaperz_kinetic Dude's paying $5 for somebody who doesn't know he exists to say acknowledge him.  Didn't work, so he doubled down and whined about it.  100% cringe, have a good day
[2:13:03] xolossus00: @TodBobertson cant joke around here?
[2:13:03] alsticky: theres nothing good about being cringe
[2:13:05] Winterfreeze: which layer you on? tryin to kill boss too but i'm horde
[2:13:06] FlowersAnger: It's a mix f meme songs and "rea" songs
[2:13:07] xAlastor89: it was better back then
[2:13:10] TheBeaverQueen: ABBA was discovered at eurovision
[2:13:18] 1cyveins: mizkifYUMP mizkifYUMP mizkifYUMP

[2:23:47] rad_oj: Probably also the fatty heal crazy kiting
[2:23:48] Nabucetin: blinking breaking cc? snare? perma slow?
[2:23:48] Piratuga: you don't need to press half the buttons Xar. Mage has those 2 buttons AND a really good kit
[2:23:59] AsiansFirst: xar is ssf dead
[2:24:02] AthanatosGR: Coc? Frost Nova? Blonk? Living Bomb?
[2:24:02] Alfacor: and poly
[2:24:02] RaCks001: thats why i abandoned mage. Hate living flame
[2:24:02] mylittlehombre: world of one shot craft
[2:24:04] JamesIRL: claok oof shadows will make me happy :)
[2:24:06] pax_rush: will there be another pvp duel tournament any time soon?
[2:24:10] bigwilly3737: 1800 heal?
[2:24:11] lupper05: is a class that requires skills
[2:24:15] onepieced: @Xaryu Are hunter's good at the moment?
[2:24:16] neversick_: they should double everyones hp lol
[2:24:21] gorebag13: @Xaryu what layer is it happening on
[2:24:26] leflame310: @jbeemerks Is Cloak of Shadows confirmed for rogues in SoD?
[2:24:28] snikiwii: what is that chrono, alter time?
[2:24:29] Reaperz_kinetic: @pax_rush there was one planned but it got delayed for an unknown amount of time
[2:24:32] mylittlehombre: priests need a bigger heal like this
[2:24:35] juice42069: mages should not be able to heal whose idea was that
[2:24:40] fireks: cries in warrior
[2:24:42] brayan1104: @xaryu what about paladins?
[2:24:45] mylittlehombre: priest should have a big heal like that
[2:24:46] mookerBL: paladin slap
[2:24:47] nacho2120: what class is more sought after to get into groups?
[2:24:47] xNotorietyx: you don’t like rewind time?
[2:24:49] bumblebeetoona: how does chrono work?
[2:24:51] pax_rush: @Reaperz_kinetic for sod?
[2:24:53] qteelmao: "Just one button"
[2:24:53] BroJibber: I need layer 2 invite for horde D:
[2:24:54] wazza76: I'm playing MM and love it, dps is lower but its way more fun!
[2:24:54] Nasty_Gnar: How would you suggest fixing warriors? COPIUM!
[2:24:55] cory_lockman: everyone on sod basically wants retail abilities/hp/mana/dmg but with classic graphics
[2:24:56] f4a_tony: 2 sec casttime for a 1200 heal is crazy
[2:24:59] tbalazs334: Pally is also good in dps now?
[2:24:59] nykkjen1: And no GCD..
[2:25:01] Vaporachi: mages are amazing but they suffer from the worse ... terrible mana issues and no good water to help
[2:25:02] mylittlehombre: priest pvp healing is kinda trash rn
[2:25:03] csouthy: should be a 4.5-5 sec cast like gpy
[2:25:04] VurtalTV: I got crit 1200 by chimaera shot earlier, seems MM is good in pvp after buff
[2:25:04] Rotcoil: soooo alter time? LUL
[2:25:07] xAlastor89: op
[2:25:08] Reaperz_kinetic: @juice42069 i mean... then wouldnt that mean shams shouldnt tank and rogues shouldnt tank?
[2:25:09] xNotorietyx: what about rewind time?
[2:25:13] marius402: watching Sonii destroy multiple ppl in a row in stv is very satisfying tho 😅
[2:25:18] Reaperz_kinetic: @pax_rush YEP
[2:25:18] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman no, i dont
[2:25:19] inoxkoma: @Xaryu where can i find your weakauras for buffs on discord ?
[2:25:20] xiClutchBoyix: I think making stam give 15 hp instead of 10 would be sick.  Boost up peoples hp who are gearing for stam but leave the people who want to not build stam squishy
[2:25:23] yashatheboi: Is there something new with the blood boss?
[2:25:26] Lord_Heia: But if you get kicked on it, all 3 schools are kciked right?
[2:25:27] TheCraigJr: Priest with serendipity 1.2 second greater heal
[2:25:34] juice42069: @Reaperz_kinetic no, it just means mage healing was a bad idea
[2:25:43] RealitySuks: As a rank 1 mage player how do you feel deep down having a heal on your mage ???
[2:25:47] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla all of these abilities are retail abilities just saying.
[2:25:51] Rotcoil: Can that heal get purged off?
[2:25:52] Vaporachi: imo they need to make it so when you Chronostatic you place a Beacon on the target for 15 seconds
[2:25:55] pax_rush: @Reaperz_kinetic ah good shit
[2:25:55] emagill97: is there something new for the boss??
[2:25:55] Winterfreeze: any horde on layer 2 that can invite?
[2:25:58] twobrat: Not to mention it has to be up or 5 seconds or it wastes the use
[2:26:00] Vaporachi: so you can use rewind time with it
[2:26:01] isi_quinn_isi: just hit 40 what do now
[2:26:03] Reaperz_kinetic: @juice42069 i disagree tbh. it is very strong and maybe neds a nerf but its not a bad idea
[2:26:08] leflame310: Anyone know if Cloak of Shadows is a confirmed rune for SoD?
[2:26:09] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman what abilities? the standart abilities? sure...
[2:26:09] Ervill1: why doesnt warrior have a heal KEKW
[2:26:11] Reck179: WARRIOR HEALS
[2:26:24] bigwilly3737: bro shouldve bubbled gg
[2:26:25] handy_grenade: did something change with the blood god?
[2:26:43] asloff: gamers gonna game, amiright?
[2:26:45] marvinmc420: @Xaryu they also just buffed mage heals and reduced the chrono mana cost :D
[2:26:47] Vaporachi: they need to put a beacon 15 sec buff on the target you Chronostatic
[2:26:50] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla bruh all the runes are retail abilities haha. Some may be named differently but its the same ability/mechanic
[2:27:02] asloff: @cory_lockman not true
[2:27:06] yodankbroo: HOLLLY
[2:27:09] RealitySuks: Lmao
[2:27:14] MarthozTv: Mages broken?,
[2:27:16] Reaperz_kinetic: @cory_lockman thats... wrong
[2:27:17] ScottyUSMC: yeah def fair and balanced lol
[2:27:17] mylittlehombre: priest need a big heal like this
[2:27:18] sorrowyato: +1884
[2:27:19] Nasty_Gnar: #MakeWarriorGreatAgain
[2:27:20] shukanara: is this a new build?
[2:27:21] Knocktoff: mages should never be above or given more love than classes that already were healers
[2:27:23] mylittlehombre: disc priest is unplayable in sod
[2:27:25] feskar_: much spellpower do you have?
[2:27:27] zalmighty98: can we see what a warriors pov is like ?
[2:27:31] cory_lockman: @Reaperz_kinetic nope
[2:27:34] Telosk: is there a class that easily beats mages ?
[2:27:39] QuanticShift: @Xaryu do u know rayan garcia looks like u
[2:27:41] ggmage60: All classes can one shot!
[2:27:42] neugassh: they should add a new mage armor so mages can tank
[2:27:42] Thrively: mages open world die pretty quickly
[2:27:43] hachito: is everyones OP.... arent we just P?
[2:27:44] Mister_Ript: Current state of PvP is just who can one-shot who first
[2:27:44] mrraylord: just buff feral
[2:27:44] warmupwarri0r: and rogues are not
[2:27:47] xolossus00: no alt plans for sod xar?
[2:27:48] handy_grenade: BUFF ROGUE
[2:27:49] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman idk... never played retail... all im saying is "i dont want to get all retail abilities" cause sod is sod and retail is retail
[2:27:51] anzzu432: the point of SoD is everybody OP
[2:27:51] mematu: @QuanticShift unlucky truth
[2:27:52] hachito: if everyones OP... aren't we just P?
[2:27:55] MarthozTv: What makes shamans good?
[2:27:55] bigwilly3737: yeah but shamans have to cast lava burst isnt it like a 3-4 second cast
[2:27:56] asloff: warriors in shambles
[2:27:56] Dylanooooo: idk man, seems like you dont want your mage to be nerfed lmao
[2:27:58] RealitySuks: Buff ROGUES !
[2:27:59] TrooperHuge: we want all classes to do well
[2:27:59] thrushmaster69: Mages being able to heal is just disgusting
[2:28:00] boolgogiking: i main warrior and rogue
[2:28:01] adumb25: yeah shamans got their instant heals aswell
[2:28:04] QuanticShift: @mematu rightt xD
[2:28:04] ninobambinow: Shamans are doing great! I can solo sm cath in an hour
[2:28:06] boolgogiking: wtf should i do
[2:28:06] lateloll: and boomies
[2:28:07] asloff: dem warriors though?
[2:28:08] wambalance: If rogues aren't broken then the game just isn't any fun
[2:28:09] warmupwarri0r: @boolgogiking floor pov player
[2:28:09] mylittlehombre: in this meta any healer class should have a big instant . priest are only good in shadow rn
[2:28:15] keltra2: which classes are good right now?
[2:28:15] handy_grenade: BUFF ROGUE - 5 SECOND CHEAP SHOT
[2:28:21] dreamreamer: Shamans destroy priests right now its fuuuuuuuucked up
[2:28:24] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla 1 big thing that is different is that retail has only max rank abilities. Classic/SoD u can downrank which can change your playstyle drastically
[2:28:25] dreamreamer: purge all our shit lol
[2:28:25] bloodsnaill: ferals can’t even get into raids especially on horde feel like I wasted a week leveling
[2:28:26] Matdaug: @ninobambinow as dual wield enh??
[2:28:27] biiestily: Yo Xar, I was wondering if you have a discount code on AG1, cause I am thinking about getting it 😅
[2:28:33] RealitySuks: Just buff ROGUES and the game will be better
[2:28:33] jackpepsimba: @lateloll how so? they're solidly A/B tier now but not OP
[2:28:38] mylittlehombre: priest can’t out heal the damage like a mage can. mage are better pvp healers than priests IMO
[2:28:38] coalminer69: hey XAR im in your raid finally get a chance to kill this boss very good day!!
[2:28:41] Alfacor: I feel like I want hunters to have harpoon
[2:28:49] coalminer69: ohh im Turbo lol
[2:28:55] bloodsnaill: shaman tanks out dps most dps classes and bring the most utility and mandatory buffs
[2:28:58] bigwilly3737: s pirest is better then mage id say
[2:29:08] mylittlehombre: shadow priests are still really good but . mages are really op
[2:29:08] bigwilly3737: your just rank 1
[2:29:09] RealitySuks: !addons
[2:29:09] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[2:29:10] Nasty_Gnar: Duel a warrior!!!!
[2:29:12] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman bet there are more diffrences... but my thoughts could be wrong... as i said, never played retail... and i never will prob
[2:29:20] warmupwarri0r: @Xaryu are you going to compete in the OTK tourney? What are your chances you think?
[2:29:22] D3KHAR: Hunter I eat mages for lunch
[2:29:31] shalomski: No void plague...
[2:29:31] batchestspam: yea if u cant block the silence ur screwed
[2:29:35] Basilikos12: dueling warriors is just bullying
[2:29:38] wondrous_shoopuf: in my casual opinion, nerf nothing! games funner that way
[2:29:42] g_rowdee: Free Rich
[2:29:43] Telosk: duel a hunter pls
[2:29:46] Reaperz_kinetic: @g0dzilla there are a lot of differences.. people just like being pessimistic
[2:29:52] nikweberr: i hope no hunter is speaking of being good at pvp lol
[2:29:55] BeeMcG: Beans kinda leaked the Blizz HC tourny
[2:29:56] ninobambinow: @matdaug elemental it's a nice afk gold farm with no one bothering you and de both blues at the end
[2:29:56] marius402: different Phase then?
[2:30:03] bigwilly3737: he didnt even hit him lmao hunters have no chance against xaryu
[2:30:03] Lagbolta: What's that description under improve on your shirt?
[2:30:04] Knocktoff: hype bait
[2:30:06] g0dzilla: @Reaperz_kinetic yea, i feel that way
[2:30:13] mylittlehombre: priest need instal heal like mage for pvp mostly
[2:30:13] dontgetworked: no hamstring lolol
[2:30:16] Nappycans: wand lol
[2:30:22] toemaytoez: YEP COC
[2:30:22] Incin_gaming: dont do him like that xar
[2:30:23] Dylanooooo: fun pov
[2:30:24] zalmighty98: BUFF WARS WTF
[2:30:24] shalomski: Lol 2 duels you resisted fear
[2:30:25] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla dont blame ya. Not everyone's cup of tea with more classes/specs. There are a bit more differences like CC in general. CC in classic/SoD is broken. Poly lasts like 15-20 seconds for example, but in retail it's 6 seconds max for a CC which is honestly needed for balance
[2:30:25] clee0724: the wand LUL
[2:30:36] Incin_gaming: dont wand him, oh noooo this is bad LOL
[2:30:38] mylittlehombre: or un nerf the -20 percent to healing they took in phase 1
[2:30:38] Nappycans: how mean
[2:30:40] inoxkoma: hahahha
[2:30:41] Nappycans: :)

[2:30:58] clee0724: KEKW
[2:31:00] juice42069: he lost you LUL
[2:31:00] biiestily: Yo, is there maybe a discount on AG1? 😏 thinking about getting some 😁
[2:31:02] Cyreal5: mages are so broken in duels lmao

[2:31:15] AP6969696969696969696969: haircuts looking fresh
[2:31:15] Crayonmuncher03: Listening to xar while i wrap up a 12 mile ez run!
[2:31:17] conq_89: Would you say sleepwalker over evil genius staff for pvp lock? @xaryu
[2:31:19] SghettiBoy: is it really that bad to be a warrior right now??
[2:31:22] batchestspam: you didnt have to do him like that @Xaryu
[2:31:22] instinct519: XAR I HAVENT PLAYED SOD YET, IS ROGUE GOOD TO ROLL FOR PVP?
[2:31:23] jdubz1111: is sod really better than hc?
[2:31:24] Siegarth_: im even going to logout of my warr f this
[2:31:25] Nappycans: that was pretty funny. good content
[2:31:26] adumb25: you can one shot casters as a shaman
[2:31:28] lateloll: @Crayonmuncher03 get it!
[2:31:31] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman balance is a big word for a mmo... imo balance isnt possible in any mmo... there are to many variables... i bet retail isnt perfect either...
[2:31:33] RealitySuks: He really got wanded to death
[2:31:34] botjuan1: @juuno106 bro needs a deep bong rip of AG1

[2:31:47] mylittlehombre: priest should get a big heal like mage. mage pvp healing is so much better
[2:31:48] warmupwarri0r: did they push the tourney because of the balance or is there some other reason?
[2:31:50] mathgun: what layer are you on?
[2:31:50] quessinator: What in ur opinion could save warriors in pvp? abilities etc @xaryu
[2:31:51] csouthy: @instinct519 rogue is amazing. but still does normal rogue stuff. not a lot of new stuff
[2:31:52] ugubugu_: A mighty warror
[2:31:55] Reaperz_kinetic: @g0dzilla retail pvp is a shit show LOL
[2:32:09] g0dzilla: @Reaperz_kinetic i belive :D
[2:32:10] xolossus00: xar > rogues tho
[2:32:18] ashraf_ma: @Reaperz_kinetic can you elaborate
[2:32:22] mylittlehombre: rogue is super good in world pvp as the stam isn’t increased like in bg
[2:32:23] infirmum: thats why you run 5 rogues so you have 10 vanishs 10 sprints
[2:32:26] thrushmaster69: oh how the mighty warriors have fallen, the only class to beat a caster once upon a time
[2:32:27] OrsiAlice: yo wait he shavedd
[2:32:33] Demetergaming: Demetergaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:32:39] bigwilly3737: @warmupwarri0r bro esfand is stuck in gta rp and miz opened his gym so otk is busy atm i think
[2:32:42] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu do you think they should give warriors some kind of mobility for pvp, maybe like a 5-6 sec FAPlike ability?
[2:32:43] BLUNDERGUN: are you inviting to layer?
[2:32:52] Reaperz_kinetic: @ashraf_ma classes havent been tuned in months. every class has every ability. if i fight a warlock or dk or hunter theres 25 different nameplates on my screen.. etc
[2:32:56] ryan___mcg: more duels Pog i live for duels Pog
[2:32:57] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla oh it's far from perfect in terms of balance. You're not wrong with either of those statements. Im just saying long CC is insane for classic. You can rotate so many DRs in classic. This means if you had 2-3 players rotating fear/trap/stun/poly/etc a player in classic literally will never ever ever be able to play the game for as long as you like
[2:33:01] warmupwarri0r: @bigwilly3737 they knew all that before announcing the tourney though...
[2:33:05] Moronomics: I envy
[2:33:08] Winterfreeze: any horde taht can invite me?
[2:33:12] Winterfreeze: on stv alyer

[2:33:51] SghettiBoy: @RealitySuks rebuke rune
[2:33:53] grebby71: like bamboo steamers? no way bro
[2:33:56] illuminationzo_o: kicking ppl?
[2:33:58] bigwilly3737: @warmupwarri0r true but i dont think its happening til like after summer
[2:34:03] c0gnusTV: is there more ally or horde on this server
[2:34:09] quessinator: probs Cloth Steamer
[2:34:13] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman wich is good isnt it? 2 diffrent games, 2 diffrent playstyles so everbody can pick the right one.
[2:34:16] RealitySuks: Oh you have to be running the rune. Ok ty
[2:34:18] BingoTingler: @c0gnusTV it's 50/50
[2:34:26] Kazunya_Meowryu: Hey Xar no rush on this at all but I wanted to check with ya, do you think you may check out that RP segment from Ozy later today or most likely another time? @Xaryu
[2:34:27] SaqFlap: what layer
[2:34:30] SghettiBoy: you think killing loa would be possible without streamer influence?
[2:34:31] Knocktoff: think aoe mages will ruin it?
[2:34:37] Reck179: @SAVIX
[2:34:43] quessinator: What in ur opinion could save warriors in pvp? abilities etc xaryu
[2:34:44] Reaperz_kinetic: @Knocktoff theres a good chance LOL
[2:34:45] gorebag13: what layer is it on
[2:34:49] grebby71: yeah most modern fabrics don’t really need steaming but they are still useful
[2:34:52] warmupwarri0r: @bigwilly3737 yeah I just found the news on tips twitter. was suprised there aren't many other articles about it. Looks like it might be level 50 instead.
[2:34:54] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla def true. I play both and I can not say they are the same game at all. Just saying 90% of abilities are the same between the 2 games with SoD
[2:34:54] g0dzilla: @gorebag13 2
[2:34:55] LimpsNoodles: hot take: if mage has to ice block, it’s because they were gonna lose
[2:34:55] infirmum: xar this is going to be my first time doing it. What's the strategy?
[2:35:02] csouthy: @gorebag13 layer 5 for horde

[2:36:23] ashraf_ma: @Reaperz_kinetic it's true there's been no changes in a month due to the MDI & AWC which should end by next reset , other than this receny dry spell , DF has been super consistent & frequent in terms of balancing & for the majority of it every spec has been viable.  also every spec doesn't have every ability , I think u mean every spec has an answer for something .. which is good for fair pvp ...
[2:36:23] lateloll: @Yemenmohi bengal is different, its in the game files just not accessible
[2:36:39] Mister_Ript: Mount isn't on the loot table online.
[2:36:39] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman well, sure the abilities overall are the same... cause i doubt blizz would love to make new abilities all the time they start something new... but abilitys can be diffrent in alot of things... even if you jchange a little thing its not the same anymore imo...

[2:40:58] Reaperz_kinetic: @ashraf_ma no i meant what i said every spec has every ability maybe not the same name but they all can do the same things. Theyve all become homogenized which is more an issue with retail in general not just pvp. also in arenas you shouldnt have a button for everything.. that doesnt make for good pvp what you bring to your group as a class should matter and tbh for the most part in retail it doesnt/hasnt for a while. IMO thats what made the WotLK/Cata/MoP era of pvp so special

[2:49:25] cory_lockman: @Reaperz_kinetic how would u feel about offering an option to change it from 20 man - 30 - 40 man raids through the player window? I feel like this would help guilds who dont have 2 -20 man rosters

[2:51:14] hotplateishot: grief citr
[2:51:16] BLUNDERGUN: beach is the worst spawn
[2:51:20] Reaperz_kinetic: @cory_lockman i think being able to pick a raid size would be  nice. I feel like most people rn dont have 40 man guilds tho since the raids are 10 mans. I wouldnt mind having the option for like 20-40 man raids
[2:51:24] NutterCircus: Stream snipers haHAA
[2:51:56] Reaperz_kinetic: @cory_lockman its the season of DISCOVERY im honestly done for the devs to try anything as long as they change it if it doesnt work
[2:51:58] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla Not sure how old you are or care too much, but I will assume that we have a ton of life to live ahead of us. I highly recommend working out if you don't do so already. The endorphins really make u feel better
[2:52:03] Reaperz_kinetic: down*
[2:52:11] g0dzilla: @Reaperz_kinetic pretty sure blizz said "picking raid size" isnt possible for classic... or it would be to much work... but pls dont quote me on that...
[2:52:23] Diddly_dope: A STONE?

[2:53:04] Kryptiiq: Yes
[2:53:06] Kryptiiq: It ddoes
[2:53:06] Dhars: Sounds familiar
[2:53:09] TEEEEmac: that is a fact
[2:53:10] Reaperz_kinetic: @g0dzilla oh for sure it would probably be a coding nightmare but the ground work for it is kinda laid with retail and WotLK. but obviously i dont work there so what do i know KEKW
[2:53:11] Dr0ddy: Correct
[2:53:11] Kryptiiq: Kha’damu no longer drops extraneous items. Kha’damu now recovers less health from his self-healing effects. As Kha’damu grows in size, he now becomes more susceptible to attacks.
[2:53:12] NutterCircus: I love savix, he is a character.
[2:53:13] AnguishTM: correct
[2:53:15] orcuuh: same here
[2:53:18] Knocktoff: no one is helping, just PVP rn

[2:53:30] Dhars: "the larger he grows, the more vulnerable he becomes" what are we talking about here?
[2:53:35] jbeemerks: heals less more dmg bigger he gets
[2:53:36] g0dzilla: @cory_lockman Im 28. Yes, i hear that alot... Sadly i dont know how to motivate me to work out. I also struggle to leave my appartment because of acciety and stuff. So ye... Its easier said then done...
[2:53:39] Reaperz_kinetic: @Knocktoff you called the aoe mages KEKW
[2:53:54] Babobop: @Dhars thank you i wasn't the only one
[2:54:03] BLUNDERGUN: mages are the scum of sod KEkW
[2:54:11] taylorsdank: @g0dzilla even just a walk every day is tremendous for your health and state of mind
[2:54:12] g0dzilla: @Reaperz_kinetic But, i agree. It would be a cool thing i think.
[2:54:13] Diddly_dope: PAUSE
[2:54:16] SlapdickWoWplayer: what is stone hard?
[2:54:16] Knocktoff: HUH
[2:54:16] bigwilly3737: huh

[2:54:17] kindaopmusic: xarGasm

[2:54:21] Doolie27: HUH HUH

[2:54:42] TEEEEmac: they just removed sword
[2:54:44] Swapzz_: so many griefers lol
[2:54:52] mctwist__: extraneous items
[2:54:53] cory_lockman: @g0dzilla Understood. Everyone starts somewhere though. Even if you start working out 1-2 a week, u will feel the benefits both mentally and physically. U got this!
[2:54:53] g0dzilla: @taylorsdank Im happy if i can force myself to go outside 1 day a week. Every day, im far aaway from that. But im working towards it.
[2:54:54] Dr0ddy: extraneous loot removed
[2:55:10] warmupwarri0r: of course mages are spamming around the altars again griefing you guys
[2:55:11] NAT0_141: just gonna drop linen cloth and a minor mana pot

[2:55:42] Stoner125: blowin ?
[2:55:42] Reaperz_kinetic: @g0dzilla i know this probably wont help BUT if you cant motivate yourself to get to the gym FORCE yourself to go even if its just to go walk on the treadmills by yourself for a little while anything that can help make you going to the gym a habit. itll suck at first but ive had friends in the same spot and doing that helped them a ton
[2:55:42] henk121: he gets bigger if u hand in bloods
[2:55:57] Frostlicious: Turn blood in for faster kill @xaryu
[2:56:02] Reaperz_kinetic: @g0dzilla everyone is different tho

[2:59:33] g0dzilla: @Reaperz_kinetic Im trying. Every day i say stuff like "tomorrow i go take a walk for 20 min" and then, i dont do it cause i feel shit. Its not like i dont want to. When i was young, i was a active kid. We went climbing/hiking/went into caves and shit... I had no issues with beeing with groups/humans but somehow that all changed sadly... I want to get back to that. Nothing more like that
[2:59:35] coastalhappiness: What's the best class in cata

[3:00:09] dedknd: COPIUM
[3:00:11] clamshell24: i think it would be way better without boss, 5 man groups roaming around fighting would be cool
[3:00:16] rakezz13: what does he drop?
[3:00:17] jackpepsimba: dogpile meta keeps you moving to diff spots in the zone
[3:00:20] SchmeckoButterboy: why are you aoeing down the people that are doing damage on him?

[3:02:18] bloodsnaill: the main problem with mage is if you have a mage every other class feels awful farming STV

[3:03:48] Reaperz_kinetic: @g0dzilla true therapy should help but also instead of only going on the days you want to go you also make yourself go on days you dont want to

[3:39:42] killadalegend: deathwing destroys everything and turns it into wow 2 Pog @Xaryu
[3:39:45] bnb02: maybe create  1-2 servers for every expansion from classic till mop and let ppl decide what they want to play
[3:39:49] sgtsmid: They should go to MoP and then add a chromie time system  that's like seasonal raiding for all the expansions up to MoP

[3:40:02] Snorlax_King: i thin classic will go through all the expac. and expecting anything different is foolish. they didnt do tbc era and wrath era so.
[3:40:02] Reaperz_kinetic: @killadalegend thats to good an idea for blizzard to comprehend
[3:40:07] fenitsz: you keep classic one expa before the current retail for people to experience, everytime retail advance classic gets to that expa
[3:40:09] adumb25: @xaryu I'm cool with finishing on timeless isle
[3:40:10] taglinetv: Incoming TBC SOD Classic

[3:40:25] miciahclay: I wouldn't be surprised that if classic+ does come out, they just nuke SOD and start it fresh

[3:40:32] DynaMightq: @Xaryu is it not confusing for new players that there is 4 different versions of wow to play?

[3:40:37] Simmshady: @Calaum facts TBC era baby
[3:40:37] erousagi: if Blizzard big dick enough, after MoP Classic, they just start a different timeline where Garrosh didn't start WoD with a completely new expansion COPIUM
[3:40:37] Freezzypop: imagine if they just made retail so sick everyone would play that again

[3:40:58] thehayzehunter: maybe make a cycle with prestige system for old characters or smth like that
[3:41:00] cepsegnever: @SghettiBoy bcos they didn't give classic+, they just put future expansion skills and talents into vanilla, its retailizing vanila basically its so embarassing, classic+ could be cool in the other hand, new raids zones etc at max lvl, but why ruin it like this? wrong direction imo

[3:52:51] pricew205: @Xaryu why is WoW so hard for new players? I just started and everything is confusing. Any advice?
[3:52:56] SuaSponte: if you alternate the weekly and wsg its not that bad of a grind
[3:53:00] Snorlax_King: @Reaperz_kinetic i can play era to the end with cliackers and 60yr olds. but GL trying to get them into mythic/heroic content.  if you playstayle is casual both will do it for you BUT retail endgame content being designed around World first mythic raiders makes it not casual friendly. i can play CS/val casually does it make them more casual than CoD/BF?
[3:53:02] Drepulus: after revered u don't take rep
[3:53:03] markusgg_: the que changes for BGs are so good @xaryu

[3:56:34] Reaperz_kinetic: @Snorlax_King i feel like youre getting mad cause im calling the version of wow you seem to main casual.... i never said classic wasnt casual as well... i just said retail is ALSO casual... both can be true at the same time... also LFG and normal difficulty is also endgame content.... its free/easy/boring endgame content but its still the endgame. I dont like to play retail casually but the majority of it is a casual game.
[3:56:38] Bloodleh: cata pvp is great
[3:56:42] zen0vae: anyone that thinks they can beat you in a duel is getting hustled
[3:56:43] macjcool: did you confirm if he moved to canada/

[3:57:25] BlindGiraffe: @inspect4 life is ephemeral
[3:57:26] SoSoBurrito: did he move because he thinks he won't have to file taxes?  that won't work cohhBonk
[3:57:27] Reaperz_kinetic: @Snorlax_King tbh the most non casual version of wow is classic HC.
[3:57:28] timkablam: Xar can you explain yourself, when did you switch to ally? did sylvanas betray you?
[3:57:29] samuxtv: He didnt even give us 12g or 3 silver coins theres no reason anymore
[3:57:32] rinohwow: surely he moved to canada right chat Clueless
[3:57:33] wimi1001: kill it 100 more times maybe mount is 1%
[3:57:33] asloff: i plan to move up there eventually
[3:57:34] themadfeltcher: They hotfixed it to say "dropped less unnecessary loot" hopefully that doesn't mean nothing
[3:57:35] jaymesze: Is cata pvp as solved as WOTLK? or more balanced?

[5:33:21] CitizenDesmond: @Xaryu I love dragons dogma 1 even if the graphics are rougher. It allows you to climb on giants and stab them or shock weapon out of their hands. Its quite cool.

[5:34:01] paraizord: but we play wow classic lol
[5:34:01] JayyyRS: yep DD1 felt way too clunky for combat

[5:34:32] XxArchAngelPwnxX: I think the graphics (other than some of the spells) are better than retail
[5:34:32] rasmusbudtz: Some things look bad
[5:34:33] Phoenix3215: They did update them some
[5:34:33] Dassarian: The graphics are stylized pretty well, so i agree
