[1:42:55] NutterCircus: The illegals are nothing less than Invaders and should be treated as such.
[1:42:58] Wraeri: the US needs to do better to incentivize having kids
[1:42:59] TurboBased: KEKL after they grant amnesty to 30 million illegals?
[1:42:59] LoRswat: Japan's is awfully low now, too?
[1:42:59] d4ceric: i had two kids, i did my job, enjoy douches

[1:43:37] Kiromancer: legal slavery
[1:43:39] normageqq: because it's insignificant and costly
[1:43:41] dirbagdan: They don't want to. Planned destruction of the West
[1:43:49] lerler: its a made up problem so yall can have something to be conservative
[1:43:52] Xara36: this is why they want the immigrants, because liberals are aborting all of their kids and not having kids to not miss going to the movies....while conservatives are having 3+ kids.  In 20 years we'll be a right leaning country
[1:43:53] fart_boiii: poor kids
[1:43:58] daijahaden: @dirbagdan Gotta be some differences though, right. You can't deport a natural born citizen for example.
[1:44:03] SynergisticTV: they want no more why peepo
[1:44:04] Cuban_Sanwich: The amount of conspiracy theories in this chat is insane.
[1:44:10] Knaldstiv: @lerler you must be stupid
[1:44:13] Rusty52986: @lerler the amount of ignorance it takes to say that.
[1:44:20] NotTheWheel: @StaysafeTV people say illegals pay taxes... but how do you do that with no social security number?
[1:44:22] NutterCircus: Dont Mexico my America. KEKL
[1:44:25] Mind_G0bl1n: importing tax payers, renters and cheap labor and lib voters4 in 1 package deal for the rich
[1:44:28] MrSuperFudge: even with your 85 iq minimum... kekW
[1:44:29] fart_boiii: fuck the military
[1:44:30] madgarlicjr: thats some final days of the roman empire shit
[1:44:31] Merex760: I just don't want us to end up like Japan. They have a serious issue with age of population cause of no one having kids + insanely strict immigration laws
[1:44:33] Man_SlaughterTV: Retention sucks too!!! i cant wait to get out, even if i dont regret it

[1:44:46] lerler: its okay yall brain rotted, in 2 years yall gonna be fighting another made up shit and then ull realize how dumb you are @Knaldstiv @Rusty52986
[1:44:47] sweetleaf_: In the big city near me they brought up a bill to let non citizens be police officers.
[1:44:49] d4ceric: thats very good deal
[1:44:49] lagginginironforge: as a canadian, I would do that.
[1:44:51] Xara36: @lerler tell that to the state trooper who was killed by an illegal in oregon (maybe it was washington) or the girl in georgia that had her head bashed in by an illegal
[1:44:52] LoRswat: with an excellence credit line, too
[1:45:00] LoRswat: *excellent
[1:45:05] normageqq: @Mind_G0bl1n most immigrants are conservative
[1:45:08] iBanEvader: @Xara36 that is so farfetched lmao
[1:45:13] HopperFly621: you could always be a non us citzen to join the military 20 years ago when I was in I served with several guys who used joining the military to get their citzenship
[1:45:20] Knaldstiv: @lerler, if its not a problem explain please
[1:45:32] MrSuperFudge: partly because americans have an entirely fucked up idea of socialism
[1:45:33] Rusty52986: @lerler I see, so what is not made up then?
[1:45:34] Kiromancer: its us here in twitch chat :D
[1:45:35] lerler: always with an anecdote KEKW @Xara36
[1:45:35] dirbagdan: @daijahaden yes but deportation isn't a right or an ammendment. for example the first ammendment and second both apply to me as a canadian visiting. I carry my pistol when I'm in the US when I'm in a carry state, for example. Obviously certain rights apply only to citizens such as voting, but all basic constutionally protected rights are applicable to all foreigners on US soil
[1:45:38] LoRswat: LUL
[1:45:39] daijahaden: @normageqq That's definetly not the case. Only true for specific immigrant groups like Cubans and maybe Venezuelans.
[1:45:49] Kenshin894: have you seen the prequel to this video? theres actually a lot of immigrants from different countries there too. lots of people think its mexican hate
[1:45:49] Mind_G0bl1n: @normageqq not talking about immigrants also you missed the beginning of the video clearly
[1:45:54] Spudea: @normageqq look what happened during the amnesty of the 80s, california was republican, after amnesty, it flipped democrat.
[1:45:54] kurupone: no
[1:45:56] NutterCircus: It reminds me of the Taiwan situation, the few American Flags, people wanted to protect them.
[1:46:02] Xara36: @lerler thats not what anecdote means you clown
[1:46:07] bigwank69: yes
[1:46:08] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV citizens always need priority over immigrants
[1:46:15] Kiromancer: then keep it that way :D
[1:46:16] iBanEvader: and i'm pro immigration
[1:46:21] Bigcricket: fair

[1:46:31] kurupone: *yes its BASED
[1:46:37] iBanEvader: what they are doing right now is scandalous
[1:46:38] dirbagdan: @daijahaden This is why Guantanamo Bay exists, in part. The consitution does not apply there, so they can get away with all kinds of crazy shit and legally be somewhat protected

[1:48:09] CannonM2K: Happens in Germany Check
[1:48:11] MrSuperFudge: Yea the cultural fabric will change, but america is literally built on immigration over assimilation... at least in principle, is it not? @StaysafeTV you may check logs now, havent given a direct reply, but think youd get the jist. T

[1:49:32] daijahaden: @dirbagdan Gotcha. Thanks making it clear. I was getting it mixed up. I suppose in my country the rights granted by the constitution are more tied to citizenship than to the territory it's applied on.
[1:49:48] Kenshin894: dont people in europe has a similar feeling about the refugees? im not too versed on their politics

[1:50:07] NutterCircus: The stupids only have time to accept the history the television gives them.
[1:50:10] iBanEvader: @Kenshin894 it's literally the same story in Europe

[1:50:34] MrSuperFudge: 100%, but after the industrial revolution then
[1:50:35] NotTheWheel: if unfettered illegal immigration was Americas intent why have we granted amnesty before to illegals? @MrSuperFudge Granted Pardon by the government... What would they be being pardoned by?

[1:53:28] TurboBased: D: every western nation doesnt want to be replaced?

Agree on the EU point though. If you want a federal EU superstate, all those national identities kinda stand in your way. So, simply replace your populations with people who have no connection to the land.

There's a company that has bought thousands of miles of highways in the US Canada and Mexico. Many in Texas for example used to be public roads and are now toll roads. The same company owns all toll roads in Ontario. They were built with my tax money and then sold for a pittance to this company who now tolls us to drive it. They are currently expansing to link Texas to Ontario to connect Mexico.

[2:45:38] Raivan994: guess I have to wait til 2033 to play it again
[2:45:42] caltex88: I think all expacs should be set up 1 era permanent server, and 1 seasonal server that resets ever 24 months
[2:45:42] M000gul: finally time to quit the game
[2:45:45] Vallun: isnt war within the current expac
[2:45:46] Maruika: is he complaining about only having 4 game modes, when for 15 years there was 1
[2:45:47] Ropy123: people will stay play, they will still come back and play those eras, but they need to get rid of bots, inflation makes it imposible for new players
[2:45:52] vasily_zee: lol won't do the netherwing grind again
[2:45:58] NotTheWheel: It was released at a bad time
[2:46:07] citrci101: They shouldve done self found from the beginning....

[2:46:25] muvh_: Feels bad. But I'm enjoying it despite that
[2:46:29] boopbopbamski: hit 60 and just join a raid with ppl who are already full raid gear
[2:46:31] fart_boiii: i never even played hard core ssf
[2:46:35] fart_boiii: but thats wack

[2:46:38] CookieClickerLegend: my queen!
[2:46:52] NotTheWheel: I thought there was gonna be a wrath era?
[2:46:56] sweetleaf_: you cant cater to every single wow fan
[2:46:57] LiquidGrizz: I liked tbc
[2:46:59] Ropy123: everyone will lvl to 85, not sure after that if they keep playing :p
[2:47:06] Kiromancer: time for private servers
[2:47:10] caltex88: I'm really surprised they did Cata. I thought they'd end it after wrath
[2:47:13] fart_boiii: bro cata pvp is the best thing coming
[2:47:16] olashma: fumbles the bag so rediculously in that voice is hilarious
[2:47:16] fart_boiii: then sod p3
[2:47:19] VenomVeinZ: classic shadowlands when?
[2:47:28] AtCollins: @staysafetv I think they’re going to bring SoD into TBC
[2:47:29] reimur: can u x4 this guys voice. lol
[2:47:34] boopbopbamski: the faction balance blizz is using in SOD will be used in all future servers
[2:47:36] jameserush1: and remove flying
[2:47:45] Spanos_: 20 years really
[2:47:50] Ropy123: @VenomVeinZ if people get bored fast, they will probably rush expansion every 6 monts
[2:47:57] hechi224: 0 world pvp sounds great compared to sod
[2:47:58] ticeyx: no one world pvps anymore
[2:47:58] boopbopbamski: ehhhhhhh i hope no
[2:48:00] Raivan994: Firemaw golden days

[2:48:23] sighwarlock: god i hope not outland
[2:48:24] Vallun: tbc + lmao
[2:48:25] AtCollins: because the TBC market is huge @staysafetv
[2:48:25] jiggeritus: they will allow SOD transfers to new TBC servers i bet
[2:48:27] citrci101: Whats the problem with extending the level cap? If you are adding more content why not more levels?
[2:48:28] fart_boiii: mop
[2:48:29] wesley_dalton: why not just play retail? genuine question
[2:48:30] Mawshaw: How out of touch would they have to be to do TBC SOD instead of extending vanilla content, surely not right? Clueless
[2:48:34] Faramar: @chuckstieg agreed

[2:50:04] Valvax: the reason why im not playing wrath right now is because its going to cata
[2:50:10] boopbopbamski: good news blizz wont be doing that and they will keep making vanilla seasonal servers over and over they will keep the good each season remove the bad and keep adding new stuff EZ $$$ for them
[2:50:16] CadiaStandsTV: Back to Vanilla PVT servers that last years LUL

[5:26:28] yung_jed: how do you do it?
[5:26:28] Mind_G0bl1n: they're playing arma 3 all day
[5:26:30] Jitsutim: civilian life doesn’t make sense after
[5:26:41] NotTheWheel: they can do it no problem
[5:26:48] Deekity: Depends on the level of consciousness of the individual
[5:26:49] MMOTV: been out of the Marines for 4yrs and still trying to adapt to civilian life

[5:27:29] lagginginironforge: What a strange company to start
[5:27:32] Metaphix: are they the ones who got killed in fallujah in like 2004 that sparked the marine invasion and huge battle
[5:27:34] lagginginironforge: but guess it worked out well
[5:27:40] unscconnor2: PBD is such an underrated interviewer

[5:28:18] sixpackchad: best decision i made was joining the miltary, second best was leaving
[5:28:20] KKonaStevieG: my uncle was on jack murphy's podcast and a few others i think
[5:28:24] NotTheWheel: Joining the military is a good opportunity if you have nothing it changed my life for the better I was only in for 6
[5:28:28] Metaphix: i got raised by a single mom and being around men 24/7 mentors and such was so good for me
[5:28:29] MMOTV: @sixpackchad so damn true
[5:28:46] BadGrahmmer: the military changed my families life for the best by a lot
[5:28:46] Jitsutim: I didn’t have a ton of transferable skills so I teach martial arts
[5:28:48] clozer_kek: Like owning a boat
[5:28:48] MMOTV: 100% dont recommend
[5:28:51] IR_ish: `do as i say, not as i do`
[5:28:51] Mind_G0bl1n: military is a pretty broad term..
[5:28:57] NotTheWheel: I think it was worth it in the end
[5:28:57] mattynuts: 100% don't recommend my route either.
[5:29:04] batmern_: same
[5:29:06] topdemona: @StaysafeTV its 100% worth it for ONE 3-6 year contract and then get disability for the rest of your life. SUPER VALUE. Free health care and money. It was dog shit but worth it.
[5:29:09] NotTheWheel: but you need to really think about it
[5:29:10] SpaceGhost8: same, took the ASVAB too
[5:29:11] CocaneSpider: It's different now, woke shit and they purged all the free thinkers by requiring a jab or discharge.
[5:29:15] topdemona: Doing a long term is 100% NOT WORTH IT
[5:29:16] KKonaStevieG: me and my cousins were gonna enlist and try and get into LRSD and my uncle was like fuck no KEKW
[5:29:29] Daximus_: which branch? or did you say sry
[5:29:32] NateTheGreatish: same
[5:29:34] hassokek: I'm not american and never understood why you give so much credit about people that wento to the military
[5:29:34] darkbringerrgw2: I assume its like most things, where being at the top/higher end goes better
[5:29:38] SpaceGhost8: eh, I think things turned out better than if I had
[5:29:39] IR_ish: sstvWAT it's great for camping
[5:29:42] postboy710: 90% chance u come out alcoholic
[5:29:44] Roxannamyu: FOMO
[5:29:49] Metaphix: im glad i joined, infantryman been to afganistan and iraq no regrets
[5:29:51] jimmythegents: It's like the movie family Man Nicolas Cage
[5:29:52] lagginginironforge: work oil fields > army
[5:29:53] NotTheWheel: You seem like a Chairforce guy
[5:30:04] HeIlraiser_: did not get accepted because of asthma and I was cross country running champ at the time lol
[5:30:09] yuckil: joined stormwind guard instead??
[5:30:25] KKonaStevieG: i never talked to a airforce recruiter, the marines were constantly bugging me LUL
[5:30:33] Metaphix: @lagginginironforge more money thats for fucking sure
[5:30:38] Jitsutim: I’ve been out 20 yers its apparently a different army now
[5:31:01] lagginginironforge: @Metaphix especially if you have ANY skill they can use. Welding, mechanics, engineering, whatever.
[5:31:20] NotTheWheel: We do get peoples shit together right quick.
[5:31:31] SpaceGhost8: they would have to change to keep recruiting
[5:31:33] Wrecktangular: They might have charged you for war crimes from all your protein farts
[5:31:43] Vallun: military, sports team, anything like that will build character that many people lack these days
[5:31:44] Metaphix: ppl getting kicked out constantly for being fuck ups tho lol @NotTheWheel
[5:31:44] yuckil: complacent army monkaW
[5:32:00] NotTheWheel: @Metaphix We don't need trash obviously.
[5:32:07] cjadude: yeah theyre called PATRIOTS
[5:32:08] HeIlraiser_: animals warriors
[5:32:12] SpaceGhost8: there aren't enough of them
[5:32:12] Metaphix: especially combat MOS's
[5:32:24] sixpackchad: it's gay, it's woke
[5:32:32] xangfang: coworker is in the reserves and she says a lot of the new people they recruit are pussies
[5:32:35] lagginginironforge: What is it about the military that squares up people so well? Is it the strict regiment for young men?
[5:32:49] shrektard69: @xangfang yeah cuz theyre desperate for ppl i assume
[5:32:50] Mind_G0bl1n: gay POG
[5:32:50] NotTheWheel: They started just introducing that stuff when I was leaving
[5:32:51] Metaphix: @lagginginironforge yeah pretty much that.
[5:33:07] CocaneSpider: @StaysafeTV the freethinkers left when told they had to take the jab
[5:33:09] inspiredtv: @lagginginironforge something about getting yelled at and degraded for 8 weeks that really turns you into a malleable being
[5:33:15] ChaptinRedbeard: na, who wants to risk  death for 30k a year
[5:33:30] Rekrian: I currently serve in the Air Force and it has turned in to a Fortune 500 company with gender identity classes etc
[5:33:33] lagginginironforge: interesting. How similar is basic training to the movies?
[5:33:35] Metaphix: @ChaptinRedbeard the vast, vast majority of military jobs are not risking death especially now
[5:33:44] inspiredtv: @lagginginironforge not similar anymore
[5:33:50] malingonium: Holy shit you've got a lot of salvages
[5:33:52] inspiredtv: also depends on branch
[5:33:55] Rekrian: I don’t recommend the military to anyone anymore. benefits don’t make it worth
[5:34:01] Rekrian: basic training is easy
[5:34:03] inspiredtv: airforce bootcamp a few years ago was pretty meh
[5:34:03] Metaphix: pretty similar, same archetypes of ppl
[5:34:05] Naddah: not like it anymore
[5:34:07] sixpackchad: US navy boot camp is not how the movies depict
[5:34:07] tepsx: Air force BMT  wasn't bad. just different. Army is prob alot worse
[5:34:08] Metaphix: full metal jacket was good
[5:34:10] SaucyRMD: A lot of basic training is co-ed now.  Very few all male (Only Fort Benning) It's a cake walk if you are in shape
[5:34:14] unscconnor2: I wouldnt know, but i heard Full metal jacket wasnt too far off what it used to be
[5:34:17] NotTheWheel: like that first half of fullmetal jacket it's like that... but it's super easy
[5:34:21] NotTheWheel: just go through the motions
[5:34:23] BadGrahmmer: Your answer is going to vary dramatically based on what decade they were enlisted
[5:34:24] kheap_: it was coed for me as well
[5:34:30] NotTheWheel: it's designed for you to pass
[5:34:31] sixpackchad: i've heard second hardest is coast guard
[5:34:31] inspiredtv: @tepsx army gets their phones now
[5:34:37] NotTheWheel: just keep at it
[5:34:44] KKonaStevieG: WutFace
[5:34:50] Metaphix: also depends on where, fort benning infantry basic is gonna be harder than other army basic training
[5:34:53] NotTheWheel: and don't leave for the military until you're ready
[5:35:05] KKonaStevieG: yeah they call fort jackson relaxin jackson KEKW
[5:35:16] lagginginironforge: Sounds like a giant orgy
[5:35:42] inspiredtv: my experience in the military was a giant who can step on whos neck to get farther type thing
[5:35:43] KKonaStevieG: just say yes Kappa
[5:35:47] astrangechatter: just you
[5:35:49] Naddah: you would fit in with the military crowd
[5:35:49] lagginginironforge: You have that dead eye stare, you look like youve killed someone
[5:35:54] NotTheWheel: I don't really care about discounts it makes me feel weird
[5:35:55] sirdreadeye: discount, people do it
[5:36:14] mattynuts: no business ever asks if you qualify for a discount
[5:36:16] TheBeaverQueen: idk about the US but in Canada we have a Veteran ID card thats from National Defense
[5:36:19] zim266: sstvWAT
[5:36:19] KKonaStevieG: gravy seals YEP
[5:36:24] Metaphix: they dont realize that a military guy is going to INSTANTLY notice the uniform KEKL
[5:36:25] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV based on the opinions you've espoused, i think you'd be very critical of today's military, as someone who was in it for 6 years
[5:36:40] hammywarrior: yeah i dont take the discount.  it feels weird
[5:37:13] Metaphix: yeah women in infantry wtf is that
[5:37:37] TheBeaverQueen: they can probably shoot better than you @Metaphix
[5:37:39] Frayeen: Have u watched the yt vid by Big boss about Blizzard yet? @staysafetv
[5:37:54] NotTheWheel: did he check out that moronic minds :x
[5:38:00] NotTheWheel: D:
[5:38:02] xangfang: give so much money on other wars
[5:38:02] Metaphix: @TheBeaverQueen they cant, and the vast majority couldnt carry me to a helicopter either
[5:38:06] NotTheWheel: tomorrow for sure COPIUM
[5:38:09] HeIlraiser_: @Metaphix its the same with the police forced by the gov
[5:38:10] Frayeen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67BFdPVKYjk&ab_channel=bigboss
[5:38:12] Frayeen: this one
[5:38:12] Freenix: I’m going on 13 years now it is what you make of it. honestly has got me to a way better position in life. don’t believe everything you see on the news about wokeness, some memo will come out someone will brief it once and then realistically no one gives a fuck about it and things keep on moving.
[5:38:17] Roxannamyu: I'm guessing I missed the lil p drama?
[5:38:22] Afterh8: hows the new place SS
[5:38:30] TheBeaverQueen: @Metaphix cause you're probably a fat fuck who never ever been close to a military base in your life get a life
[5:38:32] poorboy55: hambergers and movies, get outa here!
[5:38:32] abruptdecayO_O: for me, critiquing the military having not served feels very gross idk id rather a vet speak on it
[5:38:45] abruptdecayO_O: its so different a life
[5:38:49] malingonium: @thebeaverqueen LUL
[5:38:55] The_Loony_Bin: you know what movie i just watched with my gf, Soul the pixar movie. If you have disney plus deff a try
[5:39:07] unscconnor2: @StaysafeTV how many biden gaffes should we expect from the state of the union tomorrow?
[5:39:08] Roxannamyu: Did you see Payo's video?
[5:39:19] Metaphix: @TheBeaverQueen was infantry, been in combat many times. You're just wrong. Women are great but they are not capable of carrying a 200lb man in full kit to a helicopter sorry
[5:39:21] kheap_: yeah about a scam guild lol
[5:39:27] Roxannamyu: He complains he got scammed in gnomer

[5:39:49] lagginginironforge: I cant wait for him to stumble the entire state of the union
[5:39:51] TheBeaverQueen: maybe in the US idfk but in Canada we have no fucking problem carrying our brothers and sisters in arms
[5:39:53] mattynuts: @kheap_ i saw the clip but didn't understand because he just hip thrusts the entire time. Don't really get it,.
[5:39:55] kalex214: are we watching?
[5:39:55] johnnyhopkinwead1: he rage wiped them and cursed them out then left lol
[5:40:00] inspiredtv: gotta go all the way back
[5:40:18] ardice1: no you dont
[5:40:18] amarv: here we go again
[5:40:19] bayteors: that was me, love your stream homie
[5:40:20] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV how many times do you think biden will use the phrase "MAGA republicans" in his STOU?
[5:40:21] ardice1: go to the island
[5:40:22] bayteors: doing the same quest as you lol
[5:40:23] xangfang: I bet they get him hopped up on amphetamines to get him through the state of the union
[5:40:25] ardice1: all the way to the west
[5:40:29] chintack: i want the state of the federal reserve address
[5:40:31] ardice1: and kill nagas for the next part
[5:40:34] ryufromstreets6: you go to the island, not ratchet
[5:40:35] bayteors: its horrible lol
[5:40:42] bayteors: thankfully alliance have the fp to feathermoon
[5:40:52] lagginginironforge: lmao ofc he will
[5:40:55] SpaceGhost8: YEP
[5:40:55] sixpackchad: yes, his whole campaign platform right now is "orange man bad"
[5:40:56] sekur_: of course he will
[5:41:01] chintack: EXTREME MAGA THREATPUBLICANS
[5:41:04] Vallun: is it time for a bingo card
[5:41:05] xangfang: losing in the polls
[5:41:06] ardice1: next part of this quest you go to the island all the way to the west and kill nagas @StaysafeTV
[5:41:07] Metaphix: @TheBeaverQueen so your stance is really that women are as physically capable as men or
[5:41:15] mattynuts: @StaysafeTV what's the likely hood they will decriminalize marijuana
[5:41:17] cronoscube: based
[5:41:21] TheBeaverQueen: no but we can perform our duties the same
[5:41:21] unscconnor2: He is going to blame the border problem on the republicans because they didnt pass the recent bill that laso had funding for ukraine and israel guaranteed
[5:41:28] Roxannamyu: @StaysafeTV Random question, you ever got to Twitch Con?
[5:41:34] Roxannamyu: Go to*
[5:41:34] TheBeaverQueen: @Metaphix not always but we can perform our duties the same
[5:41:35] clozer_kek: I'm voting for SStv/DJT
[5:41:36] TrueSmugg: @TheBeaverQueen YWNBAW
[5:41:42] mattynuts: @StaysafeTV Well descheduling might happen and biden could use that as a ace.
[5:41:42] nyckcage: Decrim & tax that shit
[5:41:47] chintack: @unscconnor2 the bill that made their human trafficking legal yeah
[5:41:49] malingonium: I can't believe biden would want to spend the next four years as president anyways lmao
[5:41:50] GoshiTheBroshi: imagine thinking DT is a good and legitimate leader. both him and biden are shit
[5:41:50] popoolist: granpa vs narcissist. Who does less dmg.
[5:41:53] SpaceGhost8: not much of a point to keep it illegal at the federal level at this point
[5:42:00] mattynuts: @StaysafeTV make out out with viewrs
[5:42:06] batmern_: twitch con looks so boring every year
[5:42:06] yeahp0n: leer as cosplay
[5:42:09] Vallun: party
[5:42:10] yeahp0n: xD
[5:42:11] nyckcage: @popoolist Trump is a great grandpa as well
[5:42:15] TheBeaverQueen: @Metaphix if they wanna pass their infantry course they have to otherwise they fail... so YES the one in infantry that I know can do the exact same shit as men... same with firefighters
[5:42:19] Metaphix: @TheBeaverQueen guess we just disagree. The vast majority of duties one would find oneself doing in the military I do agree, but 200lbs is still 200lbs and the PT standards are different for a reason
[5:42:19] clozer_kek: hard pass
[5:42:32] Roxannamyu: Fair
[5:42:33] Metaphix: @TheBeaverQueen the PT standards are different

[5:43:26] bayteors: do we still have to clear our cache to see the shadowy figure
[5:43:39] MacEleven: better be good popcorn
[5:43:43] TheBeaverQueen: @Metaphix also the ones that in infranty like I said are standard with the infantry fitness it requires, thankfully theres many trades in the military

[5:43:46] ryufromstreets6: I did
[5:43:47] NaManDatAintMe: lol

[5:44:30] ardice1: @StaysafeTV The voidcore drops of the nagas, and once you loot that you continue to kill them until the shadowy figure spawns on one of their corpses... took me 10-15 minutes i know youve done it before but incase you forgot
[5:44:30] Mind_G0bl1n: pls hang the gun its unstable
