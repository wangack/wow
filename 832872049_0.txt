[0:37:32] Vile_: Yes, they were doing splits IIRC.
[0:37:38] MOLAR305: yea he said 4 splits this week
[0:37:42] Kaykerrs: My guild ok'd their raiders to make their Legos now instead of waiting since the raid is more challenging than they anticipated
[0:37:47] TheOGMed: Just noticed Camel Club went horde :(
[0:37:56] gothicgamer1: @jacooners I'm gonna vote for DKS and Monks for progression

[0:41:41] dutchie76: hey Rob
[0:41:53] Kaykerrs: Spires is the worst for sure

[0:42:03] dutchie76: why is spires so bad
[0:42:08] sinlesssinner: nah plz , dont cave in blizzard!! dont nerf!!
[0:42:15] gothicgamer1: @lukaii I have a feeling its schedule based
[0:42:24] MOLAR305: I dont know if they'd admit "overturning by mistake"
[0:42:34] dutchie76: blizzard is playing the long game that's why
[0:42:37] sinlesssinner: this is the best start ever to an expac, raid is cleared in two days by myffic raiders, rest is having trouble. Thats good:
[0:42:38] Lukaii: back to the roots :)
[0:42:47] gothicgamer1: @lukaii they have to keep up with the patches on a schedule release so if everyone is still stuck on the first raid, it's hard to push new content
[0:42:48] bgnihrnet: what's his current ilvl?

[0:43:33] sinlesssinner: yes dude
[0:43:36] necralia: as it sould be
[0:43:37] Lavani: raid should take 3 weeks to clear
[0:43:38] TMMOOF: YES
[0:43:49] dutchie76: so like vanilla lol
[0:44:03] sinlesssinner: old school, AND the gear u do get feels good u actually kill ppl or arent killed as fast as a healer
[0:44:05] Vile_: Plaguefall can eat shit.
[0:44:09] D3m0nHunt3r666: spires isnt too bad
[0:44:10] sinlesssinner: so i think they are on the right track
[0:44:10] dutchie76: yea i dont like plaguefall
[0:44:16] dutchie76: last boss sucks
[0:44:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: plaguefall is garbo though
[0:44:21] TheOGMed: HOA baby
[0:44:25] droogzand: sanguine is hard 2
[0:44:29] TheOGMed: ToP is aweful
[0:44:32] Lavani: last boss in plaguefall is a joke
[0:44:33] Kaykerrs: That last boss with the huge tentacle hit boxes wtf
[0:44:33] Jewishraver: i dont mind plague personally
[0:44:34] gothicgamer1: I found spires easy on mythic. is it way worse in mythic plus?
[0:44:35] Sneakiel0l: just dont be bad forhead ..... lol
[0:44:50] bgnihrnet: What's his current ilvl? I'm a pally too and 48k hp is insane

[0:44:57] gothicgamer1: I was also a DK tho rofl
[0:45:05] D3m0nHunt3r666: it was fixed yesterday
[0:45:11] Lavani: they fixed the hit box
[0:45:20] pereadin: I love theater
[0:45:22] Kaykerrs: Towelliee they haven't fixed the middle puddle thing on last boss in plague fall
[0:45:22] Lavani: mechanics wise its a joke
[0:45:25] pereadin: best designed dungeon fights
[0:45:36] pereadin: PvP fight best design dungeon fight in a long time

[0:46:04] sinlesssinner: is that the pvp fight?
[0:46:07] Masqerader: aren't they all horrible takes?
[0:46:11] Sneakiel0l: if your actually doing the PVP though in that fight then honestly IDK why your doing it ... just get blown up by someone with the most burst and get your butt back up to the fight
[0:46:15] Lavani: Shiva extreme lol
[0:46:23] pereadin: @sinlesssinner pvp fight is one of the ones after this first boss
[0:46:34] sinlesssinner: yea its Xav
[0:46:43] D3m0nHunt3r666: Ohhh theater
[0:46:46] sinlesssinner: Xav The unfallen
[0:47:16] sinlesssinner: so yea sanguine affixe in saguine depths :)
[0:47:29] sinlesssinner: all them blood pools

[2:35:23] oraclespyro: @Towelliee do you think the tuning of the raid will be done soon?
[2:35:34] callmeflayer: sneakie u get more powers if u kill more and sneak thru less ;)
[2:35:53] Mr_Unexceptional: @Sneakiel0l Yeah this guy ^
[2:35:54] Sneakiel0l: You cant sneak through things that can see the sneak lol

[2:40:17] Sneakiel0l: STUPID! lol FIX IT!
[2:40:43] shimwood: I do think it would be cool if they changed it for Rogues so they get more powerful by taking less anima powers and sneaking through
[2:41:09] TheCliffyShow: Cause Blizzard are haters.
[2:41:22] Zeijun: they've always had problems soloing elies
[2:41:30] meltingcheese17: is monk hard for new players?
[2:41:56] Sneakiel0l: I shouldnt be scared in torghast with 25+ powers to make me stronger and I am .. as a rogue... its never enough lol
[2:42:17] BlackAngelxD: not monks but energy classes are a lil hard but if you lvl up as one you'll get the feel of it
[2:42:30] shimwood: Or maybe make it so Rogues can pickpocket the powers instead of attacking things head-on

[2:43:35] Sneakiel0l: Most of the mobs on the higher floors can see stealth... so that doesnt really work. We have to fight things headon. And the bosses do so much damage to us .. its tough
[2:44:15] shimwood: Peridot was so great for me Kreygasm
[2:44:29] Sneakiel0l: We just need powers that are actually meaningful and help us do damage and survive. More health etc.

[4:06:20] FIUamaro: do you guys think the raid difficulty was intended? and if so do you guys see this as a positive or negative change? I have seen the community sort of split in the topic these past few days

[4:10:39] FIUamaro: @Dabogimp i agree, but we already saw some nerfs to it. I feel they should adopt this style but maybe nerf it a week after release. Although I am pretty sure there will be people complaining that it is too hard from the start

[6:42:07] TheCliffyShow: WWE should make their own MMO and have the final raid boss be Vince McMahon. And the second to last the WWE Creative team.
[6:42:57] peternguin: uncleb8HEY
