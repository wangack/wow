[0:22:16] kirk_hunts: if we just constant zerg it
[0:22:17] arrkies91: he gets stacks by killing players then does alot of dmg, so the idea is to not die
[0:22:18] adam_brisbane: just need casters
[0:22:19] Reaperz_kinetic: nah it won’t take 200 people

[0:35:07] Ophelly: you should wait 2 minute outside of STV and get layered into a new layer
[0:35:12] RednelSlendeR: Get so many people that the boss does 0 dmg 5Head
[0:35:12] shameshady: is the 15/16 march duelist tournement still happening @Xaryu ?

[0:36:54] Kazay1998: @Xaryu our first run on gnomer, we ended up 9manning Thermaplugg because our mage DC'd
[0:36:54] Nappycans: its hard to even get a group if you have never done it. :(
[0:36:56] kirk_hunts: 50-70 minutes on average not trying to speed run
[0:36:58] druib: Me and my guild went in blind first try and it took 6 hours lol
[0:37:03] eike8989: Does anyone know for what are the Radiant Ray Reflectors ?

[0:37:46] i_am_cakes: mc is also a 20 man raid in sod.
[0:37:54] NotASkiller: banning bots is bad. nobody will raid with consumes if they're too expensive
[0:37:59] roxzssx: "ban waves" COPIUM
[0:38:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @notaskiller please tell me that’s a troll
[0:38:36] yellowfunnydoge: do you filter your water? if so what do you use?
[0:38:52] radassbadass69: stop buying gold, scrubs. go to retail and buy wow tokens
[0:38:57] kindaopmusic: bunch of people got banned yesterday for gold buying
[0:38:58] druib: @notaskiller OSRS player
[0:38:59] tacodoc: @notaskiller if the server pop was 2k instead of 25k bots wouldn't be so bad
[0:39:00] roxaz_chachvm: finally some content pog
[0:39:10] limburgse: GG blizzard
[0:39:13] Nappycans: agree
[0:39:15] NotASkiller: bots keep resources cheap. people will quit if they can't afford to level their professions
[0:39:17] SLAMMMY: big W, keep it up
[0:39:17] limburgse: agreed
[0:39:18] Domatonetv: what if getting loot in duengons had some sort of human interaction ? a quest  ? a hand in or something that bots can
[0:39:19] clee0724: Josh is Goated
[0:39:20] Domatonetv: t do
[0:39:26] dingerdoom: so many L gamers these days, bots are in market becasue of that
[0:39:26] UnKillableSold: You forgot that this might become a gold mine for them, less supply (demand of noobies wanting gold will NOT stop) demand stays about same, gold becomes more expensive
[0:39:28] limburgse: keep it up Josh!
[0:39:34] myyrlidon: Xar what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:39:37] Nappycans: The amount of communications with their community lately has been pretty amazing
[0:39:48] i_am_cakes: @NotASkiller if thats the case, the prices will naturally go down. thats how the free market works. otherwise people wont be selling any consumes
[0:39:49] Pixelate93: but why don't they share the data?
[0:39:52] geminuspr: @NotASkiller thats the biggest pile of crap iver read all day gratz
[0:39:56] Reaperz_kinetic: @notaskiller I’m gonna be honest I’m snot sure you know as much about what you’re talking about as you think you do…
[0:39:58] Gashunk1: We need AI GM's - teminator first phase
[0:40:03] roxzssx: because it's fake
[0:40:05] JukezZA: why would you give the data to the gold farmers?
[0:40:09] cianfromuruguay: bots subs
[0:40:11] myyrlidon: Xar what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:40:17] tobiaseur: tobiaseur subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 5 months wuu
[0:40:19] fetza108: @myyrlidon you wont give anything back in a constantly changing game mode
[0:40:25] lucasthebestx: fuck lvling
[0:40:28] AceOfFlame: Because it just isn't
[0:40:29] cyfercake: recent post
[0:40:31] jlann: retail mindset
[0:40:33] jlann: smh
[0:40:41] radassbadass69: imagine wanting to play a game with no RMT like classic because you dont like the way newer games monetize and then buying gold in the classic game. RIP in shit hope you lost thousands of hours
[0:40:42] fetza108: @myyrlidon *they
[0:40:50] AceOfFlame: we dont live in that world anymore, idc about having to lvl my 3rd alt for next 2 weeks
[0:40:50] graziNNN: people are tired of re-leveling through the same content,, not for NEW players
[0:40:51] DuckTwelve: bro, leveling is the fun part...
[0:40:57] limburgse: Amen indeed
[0:40:57] SmugJerry: @xaryu reddit hides votes on new posts for some time (may be configurable per subreddit, not sure)
[0:40:58] lucasthebestx: LVLING IS NOT FUN
[0:40:59] fitethepower: It doesnt take less than a day
[0:41:06] Smoothieluv: same bro absolutely
[0:41:08] fitethepower: even with 100% buff
[0:41:09] AceOfFlame: Yes it has
[0:41:10] Genghish: 100 is just waay to much..
[0:41:12] Gashunk1: yeah, leveling and doing dungeons and meeting randoms is what classic is about
[0:41:12] lucasthebestx: no it is not
[0:41:13] Smoothieluv: its about the nostalgic apeal
[0:41:13] voidtouched_93: levelers will rejoice on SSF
[0:41:13] Seoken1: Thats true but this aint classic
[0:41:15] dugdimmadomed: But its because the open world leveling is so bad right now thats teh reality
[0:41:15] i_am_cakes: @radassbadass69 i didnt. i got in 0 trouble when i bought gold. no punishment at all
[0:41:17] roxzssx: it's not
[0:41:18] TrooperHuge: i think you need 1 person at max level then the rest get the boost
[0:41:18] brentosxd: Raiding on multiple characters is fun for me
[0:41:19] AceOfFlame: Thats completely UNTRUE 2019 was all about RUSHING to 60
[0:41:19] convexdnb: they have the data and have seen the dropoff
[0:41:20] nwjames1310: I like gearing and raids and pvp not lvling that's lame
[0:41:21] roxzssx: ?????
[0:41:21] 1machido: classic is bis
[0:41:22] Forgiw: @Xaryu you have 1 character what are talking about?
[0:41:22] realxRusty: leveling is the best.
[0:41:23] YaBoy_Lijah: but this is *seasonal* content. lvling all your chars shouldnt take normal time for classic
[0:41:23] Almighty_kenzo: leveling is a fun challenge especially in hardcore
[0:41:24] Darkdeaths: i like classic but it does feel a bit long without any boost
[0:41:25] radassbadass69: @i_am_cakes scrub
[0:41:26] aackee: sod is all about endame tho
[0:41:27] Reaperz_kinetic: this isn’t classic tho
[0:41:27] xProloli: i disagree, i hate leveling and love playing at 40
[0:41:27] Gashunk1: "LFM xxx elite in xxx area"
[0:41:27] LJimbox: game startys at 40!
[0:41:27] notsofarber: This is not classic @Xaryu
[0:41:28] nwjames1310: Pvp is bis
[0:41:29] Kazzatell_cz: I agree
[0:41:29] SLAMMMY: HC HYPE
[0:41:29] Brelshar: You can literally turn the buff off, there is no issue.
[0:41:30] SipDatLean: dungeon grind meta is mind numbing, they should buff xp in open world
[0:41:31] myyrlidon: Xar what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:41:32] roxzssx: 99%????
[0:41:32] Genghish: I dont mind a boost but keep it 50
[0:41:34] Seoken1: SoD  is a seasonal server,  it should allow people time to try out alts
[0:41:35] ralphh1541: nah they want us to level alts, and it just takes too long and only hardcore degens are leveling alts right now
[0:41:35] Smoothieluv: Nostalgia wins!!!
[0:41:35] quimthewarrior: loves leveling but has one character?
[0:41:36] adam_brisbane: so why cant you get a xp boost for alts?
[0:41:37] fitethepower: L
[0:41:38] Reaperz_kinetic: this is not classic tho you gotta remember that
[0:41:38] xAlastor89: Stay level 1 forever LUL
[0:41:38] jupiterzug: what??
[0:41:39] kelhorn_: I just think the 25-40 is pretty painful though. The zones are parse and spaming dungeons is horrific
[0:41:40] Pixelate93: This is SoD tho?
[0:41:40] lucasthebestx: make lvling insta lvl 40
[0:41:43] papahy0n: xaryu leveling isnt fun, and im pretty sure blizzard has logistics which is why they increased xp
[0:41:45] imbener: for twinks
[0:41:47] shortshorts010: Isn't that gatekeeping?
[0:41:48] Seoken1: This is SoD, not class, not retail
[0:41:48] AdamAnt7: they will make alts ..its season of alts
[0:41:49] Ervill1: yeah i had more fun in progression and now that im really good gear, theres not much to do
[0:41:51] arrkies91: wow never ends, no game over
[0:41:54] graziNNN: I think this is more for the many alts people have
[0:41:54] AndersenGGWP: Yo - You playing SFHC tomorrow?
[0:41:55] druib: Discovering multiple characters cause phases are too long
[0:41:55] i_am_cakes: @radassbadass69 nah, i just have a job lol
[0:41:59] Gashunk1: it's like a dying language
[0:42:01] kohunaa: if you hate leveling, you wipe back to front
[0:42:02] lucasthebestx: skip lvling noone likes it
[0:42:02] lHlUlLlK: then make it where you can turn off your exp boost, we don't have time to work and play 12hrs a day questing
[0:42:02] potnis__: nope
[0:42:04] fitethepower: after Alt #3 noone cares abotu levelling, they just want to hit max level
[0:42:06] AdamAnt7: nope
[0:42:08] ThePlayerCoachStun: The thing is though there's phases and people feel left out if they cant get to 40 quick enough to feel they really got to experience the raid etc. Then if they want to do an alt you got runes you got to get, leveling, gear, etc
[0:42:10] stumpiftw: no I don't think its a minority
[0:42:11] Genghish: Nope
[0:42:11] EnigmaticHD: thats not a minority in SOD dude
[0:42:14] SuaSponte: could just make the buff only apply to accounts with a max level characters
[0:42:14] voncline88: Here is an idea.  If you have a max level character, you unlock a 50% bonus, if you have two max level characters you get 100%
[0:42:14] dugdimmadomed: false
[0:42:16] discommm: 1-60 is a journey but 25-40 questing was so hard to quest in open world
[0:42:16] Bolt_: EASY SOLUTION: Require at least 1 level 40 on that server before giving the buff
[0:42:17] YaBoy_Lijah: minority to have alts? lol
[0:42:17] stumpiftw: I think a lot of people have multiple alts
[0:42:19] AhoiXCI: "No game is played forever" - Some old dude to his son
[0:42:19] aackee: its not
[0:42:19] handovdoom666: wait everyone doesn't have 5 characters?
[0:42:19] jlann: not a minority in SOD , SO MANY ALTS
[0:42:19] EnigmaticHD: I am a casual and I already hve 2 at max level
[0:42:21] druib: Yeah alt life is not minority life atm
[0:42:23] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu As a PvPer I disagree with the "once you're 40 it's over". Endgame PvP is an infinite content loop. I could BG or gank all day long lol. Maybe for PvE players the game ends at max level.
[0:42:24] Smoothieluv: amen!
[0:42:25] AdamAnt7: we all have 3
[0:42:25] fitethepower: I dont believe the levelling process it the game for the majority
[0:42:26] Brelshar: Thing is, is 2019, most of us have done the leveling process probably a couple dozen times over at this point.. I know all quests off by heart, I can almost level blindfold.
[0:42:29] Seoken1: Its a huge w
[0:42:31] cutaway1: Retail Andy’s ruining SoD
[0:42:31] Airitreya: true based real
[0:42:31] lucasthebestx: u can pvp at 40
[0:42:31] AceOfFlame: no one CARES about having to re lvl over and over, endgame has always been classic as well, people in 2019 SPAMMED nothing but dungeons to speed run to 60,that is the truth there is no such thing outside of HC of lvling be the game
[0:42:34] Genghish: Ye u have to unlock the exp boost by reaching max level
[0:42:34] radassbadass69: @i_am_cakes go spend your job money in the new age bitch made games that had consumers like you in mind
[0:42:35] SmugJerry: @xaryu reddit hides votes on new posts for some time (may be configurable per subreddit, not sure)
[0:42:35] flo_406: no one likes leveing
[0:42:37] twreckz9: Couldn't they just make it to were if you have a max level character all characters after have faster xp gain?
[0:42:38] Rumseyrum04: I think it can be toggled can’t it?
[0:42:38] werner__ziegler: recent post
[0:42:39] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper
[0:42:41] PMA_1: post is too new @Xaryu
[0:42:43] Gashunk1: classic+ isn't supposed to go the same trajectory as the expansions. starting to feel a bit like that
[0:42:44] kelhorn_: I just think the 25-40 is pretty painful though. The zones are scarse and spaming dungeons is horrific experience
[0:42:44] kb_h: is it pinned?
[0:42:45] wowsuomi: Thats why they made boa's with exp boosts
[0:42:45] desfunz: You can remove the exp boost if you talk to a Innkeeper
[0:42:46] Smoothiez_: new posts
[0:42:47] roxzssx: @flo_406 we do like
[0:42:49] AdamAnt7: its good for sod ..people will keep playing to play dif chars
[0:42:51] bademmett: no bias
[0:42:51] tweekers1020: why not just make the xp boost a 2hr buff in a main city or something
[0:42:52] teriko_: classic + = retail -
[0:42:54] killawatts75: there are raids now that werent here before and rune gathering in SoD so it isnt exactly like Classic is it?
[0:42:54] Degran: Aggrend even said alts are a key thing they want to maintain in SoD.  The assumption is most SoD players have already done Classic a few times.
[0:42:54] lHlUlLlK: EVERYONE IS A CASUAL ANDY . WE ARE NOT KIDS ANYMORE
[0:42:56] chillyt616: @Xaryu they really should just make that availible to the ppl who have already leveled to max, not for first timers. a buff after the completion
[0:42:58] rjhasnoclue: Simple solution would be to make the buff an optional toggle. Use it if you want, if you don’t, toggle it off
[0:43:01] nantredan: what about increasing leveling speed only for people with 1 max level toon already, @Xaryu?
[0:43:02] jupiterzug: xaryu it’s “the experience” for you because you’re a content creator, your perspective on this is biased
[0:43:02] Celbee: I don't wanna level on any version of WoW :(
[0:43:03] Seoken1: it encourages people to actually try out the new classes/runes, rather than only focusing on their mains
[0:43:03] remarkayble: Reddit about to go publicv
[0:43:04] Bolt_: @Xaryu Just add a requirement of at least 1 level 40. So that folks who haven't leveled yet don't get the buff.
[0:43:09] sdotpuff: I think xp boost is to encourage new players or old players to come play
[0:43:09] coldyair: I’d agree with you but the beginning of phase 2 proved otherwise
[0:43:11] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper
[0:43:13] PriorERA: I think the main point is to allow players to enjoy all of the new specs/playstyles.  Yeah, it's not classic, but it allows people to try the new thing in an easier way.
[0:43:13] i_am_cakes: @radassbadass69 no? lololol sorry about your bad luck
[0:43:13] Celbee: let me be max level
[0:43:17] idkwhatodo: why not make it so you have to have one or two characters already level 40 and then you can get the 100% experience?
[0:43:18] Bolt_: Yeah, that's a trash take
[0:43:21] lucasthebestx: we want instant lvl 40 so we can pvp
[0:43:22] Bolt_: I love leveling
[0:43:26] DuckTwelve: i disagree entirely - as a non-content creator
[0:43:32] Degran: @rjhasnoclue It already is
[0:43:33] Seoken1: Hardcore is about the journey, SoD is about the destination.
[0:43:34] potnis__: this aint classic wow!
[0:43:36] detourz28: I love leveling in classic. It's relaxing and fun.
[0:43:37] fitethepower: SoD =/= Classic WoW
[0:43:37] teriko_: 99% of wow players are shit tier game designers
[0:43:37] Ervill1: progression
[0:43:38] Gashunk1: Classic is about the leveling, if not you are playing the wrong MMO
[0:43:38] twitchuser2016: but its not classic anymore
[0:43:38] tacodoc: Community
[0:43:39] Seoken1: This is SoD
[0:43:39] Pixelate93: This is SoD tho? 󠀀
[0:43:40] cxn_r: @idkwhatodo because that's fucking stupid.
[0:43:41] Madmaxx777: I think this is purely about getting people the opportunity to test as many new classes/runes/content as possible on a seasonal server. it’s a balance, obviously
[0:43:43] Twyzz: Just make the XP buff optional... like the sleeping bag
[0:43:43] Bioaim7: EXACTLY
[0:43:45] petronasmercedes: You look very cute and hot
[0:43:45] lucasthebestx: it is the world which is empty couse of layers hahahahah
[0:43:46] astrix25: my biggest argument this isn’t classic wow
[0:43:46] zebercetanayurt: I liked leveling the first 20 times
[0:43:47] kirk_hunts: BASED
[0:43:47] Seoken1: people can go play classic if they want offc
[0:43:47] fitethepower: This isn't Classic WOW
[0:43:49] AceOfFlame: If yours is the truth, then why is everyone spamming SM? @Xaryu
[0:43:49] clee0724: The open world experience Pog
[0:43:50] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper
[0:43:50] discommm: 1-60 is a journey but 25-40 questing was so hard to quest in open world
[0:43:51] killawatts75: SoD isnt Classic tho
[0:43:52] Bolt_: DuckTwelve - I don't believe you -- you have a secret YouTube somewhere LUL
[0:43:52] ogMansoN: phase  2 wpvp
[0:43:54] ConceptualDesigns: the variety of things you can do and expiriences you can have
[0:43:55] kirk_hunts: BASED ON WHAT?
[0:43:56] lucasthebestx: wake up xar world is empty
[0:43:58] radassbadass69: @i_am_cakes god I wish you were trolling but ik tards like you are everywhere. nice RMT just to blue parse and quit in 2 months
[0:43:58] xTilto: dont think you can compared the world back then to now though
[0:43:58] SIaPz: This is season of discovery - the xp boost allows people to discover and explore other classes at ‘end game’ that most wouldn’t get to do otherwise. Some folks like myself only have time to play maybe 2 hours a day and I play for the end-game not so much leveling. At the rate that I play it would take the entire phase to level and gear alts.
[0:43:59] kirk_hunts: KOOMEN?
[0:44:00] bobbiesmals: crazy take for sod
[0:44:00] iRayG2: gm homie
[0:44:01] fitethepower: it IS you
[0:44:01] AhoiXCI: I prefer leveling gather gear, dungeons, End game is not my thing
[0:44:02] roxzssx: 99? kekw
[0:44:03] Brelshar: Yeah, it feels exactly the same the 50th times round..
[0:44:05] Bendjaminw: It i the numbers.  They got dmg and health numbers right in classic
[0:44:06] eskivoart: even in retail leveling is funner
[0:44:06] killawatts75: SoD has Runes has Raids for end game so there is a reason to get there faster
[0:44:08] jlann: WoW sod isnt classic wow.. the phases make levling easy, alts are super prevelant, levelingi n the barrens 3x is MISERABLE
[0:44:08] zebercetanayurt: i had enough of leveling
[0:44:08] chillyt616: 99% percent of ppl is a little over exaggerated
[0:44:09] charbosan: What you are saying may be true for Era, but not for SOD. I am interested in what SOD has brought NEW to the table
[0:44:10] AugustBurnYOU: thats how i remember 2004 when i was 16 hahah Wow was all that
[0:44:10] astrix25: this isn’t classic
[0:44:11] binki1997: Because SoD is seasonal the XP boost is very exciting. I get less time than I used to but want to try new classes with their runes. In Classic Era, hardcore, and on my first toon to 40 I wouldnt want the XP boost. Ive met new people and found a guild with slow leveling.
[0:44:12] NNamtih: The world is the game man. Exploring is the best.
[0:44:14] Gashunk1: SoD was supposed to be classic+ no?
[0:44:14] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper.
[0:44:20] Bolt_: "This isn't classic" LUL
[0:44:21] Seoken1: XP boost is a massive W
[0:44:21] kheap_: I don’t think either side of the argument will change their mind @xaryu. I am in the side of making a faster leveling experience as I don’t have all the time in the world to level
[0:44:21] fitethepower: SoD is not Classic, bad take
[0:44:30] r4men_noodle: As a relative noob (been playing WoW less than a year). I completely agree
[0:44:32] liightzouut: the scary thing is more and more people are asking for these QOL changes and blizzard is also SLOWLY just making SOD into a RETAIL Classic... its like they are slowly trying to convert people into retail lol
[0:44:33] demololtv: demololtv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[0:44:37] dingerdoom: wait there's people who treat SoD as the new retail and think their gnomer run is impressive? whoops
[0:44:38] Bolt_: Bro, SoD players are on some mind expanding drugs - I need some
[0:44:38] roxzssx: SoD is retail, not vanilla
[0:44:40] Twyzz: buff sleeping bag to 100%, make it accessible for level 10 and its fine
[0:44:42] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper
[0:44:43] xGrumpy_: @twyzz it is optional, you can turn it off at an inn
[0:44:47] c3relki11er: wrath and retail are matchmaking lobby simulators vs classic is about the journey
[0:44:48] XxArchAngelPwnxX: I mean wouldn't an EXP toggle be the best of both worlds? You want to get a quick grid to max you can if you want to take your time you could do that too?
[0:44:51] miciahclay: @AceOfFlame So they can go back and do all the quests for increased gold. This, to my, is a big reason why dungeon spamming is the "meta" for SoD at least
[0:44:51] inhaledthc: hey xaryu are u gna finish pandoras box later
[0:44:52] Seoken1: xarPrime
[0:44:55] zebercetanayurt: if you are new to wow yes enjoy leveling, after 20 years it's enough thanks
[0:44:57] TodBobertson: WE KILLING BLOOD GOD TODAY?!

[0:45:05] lukeclev: MASSIVE W FOR CASUALS
[0:45:07] cxn_r: @Xaryu you can literally turn the XP buff at any time
[0:45:07] Bolt_: Good idea, just require a single level 40 first.
[0:45:08] Lingan: Lingan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! xarHey
[0:45:09] DeathToad007: L
[0:45:11] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut Go play 2019 classic and watch how everyone including streamers spam dungeons ASAP to 60, there no such thing as this lvling exp people truly care about
[0:45:11] eskivoart: MOSTLY A DUB
[0:45:12] myyrlidon: Xar what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:45:13] tbabytheking: i have time to catch up W
[0:45:13] Seoken1: People should be encouraged to play alts
[0:45:17] itsagamerelax: till what level does discoverers delight work to now?
[0:45:18] zartorak: big W
[0:45:20] AdamAnt7: people weree just spamming SM dude ...no one is out there lvling in the world
[0:45:23] kevo_k: @Bioaim7 SOD is a seasonal game
[0:45:24] oussamahouri: didnt he watch pendaros box 5times already chat
[0:45:25] Seoken1: Yup I quit all of my alts when phase 2 launched @Xaryu
[0:45:31] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper
[0:45:35] Forgiw: its called season of discovery we want to try as many class as we can, people only playing 1 character shouldn't say anything bad until they leveled up atleast 4-5 toon to 40
[0:45:36] rmac96: rav posted a 2.5 hour video
[0:45:37] bigwank69: why is is called joyous journey if it literally halves the journey?
[0:45:37] FaluranTV: It makes sense for a seasonal version of classic. not original classic
[0:45:38] realxRusty: my only experience with wow ever is playing hardcore and now sod. i very much agree that i enjoyed the leveling process more since i created alts after getting to gnomer and only do raids and pvp is boring af
[0:45:42] Genghish: 100% exp is insane... Plus rested and u have to do like 3 BFDs to max lvl
[0:45:44] chexsmixs: thats crazy people have that many alts. Im not even 40 yet lmao
[0:45:46] richdawg: I have a lvl 20 plus of every class. I like leveling
[0:45:48] kelhorn_: I just think the 25-40 is pretty painful though. The zones are scarse and spaming dungeons is not a good experience
[0:45:52] tomfxs: lmao that guy just bragged about having no life
[0:45:52] potnis__: But this is not classic!!!! jesus
[0:45:52] AdamAnt7: this is way better...
[0:45:52] i_am_cakes: @radassbadass69 oh i didnt buy gold in sod, but in classic and tbc i did, not trolling at all. i hit 40 in sod and have yet to log in again. this phase just isnt it for me
[0:45:53] Gennyitalia: I will also say 99% of people only have time for that stuff, I personally still haven’t hit 40 yet :/
[0:45:57] ralphh1541: this isn't classic era
[0:45:59] fetza108: 100% xp buff with SM spam imagine LUL
[0:45:59] Seoken1: @Forgiw This. people should be able to try out the new runes/classes, there is only so much time
[0:46:00] cxn_r: @Xaryu Anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper
[0:46:00] Pixelate93: This is SoD tho ur supposed to alts
[0:46:01] fitethepower: HUH
[0:46:01] gentlesoaps: dont call us out like that :(
[0:46:03] noxthentus: This aint classic tho, this is a VERY short season
[0:46:04] AdamAnt7: ok boooomer
[0:46:05] Peerly: true
[0:46:07] poopflinger69: nah you had alts in wrath
[0:46:09] AceOfFlame: So the game shouldnt respect your time?
[0:46:09] roxzssx: @Xaryu this is not classic
[0:46:10] AugustBurnYOU: ALTS MOP
[0:46:11] sdotpuff: Me too
[0:46:12] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame IMO they should change dungeon spamming to 2 instances per hour
[0:46:12] SlapdickWoWplayer: I still just main 1...screw that
[0:46:12] naela1989: alts suxx
[0:46:14] ottomonster: i had plenty of alts in wotolk :P
[0:46:14] Ddocz: back then my alts were lvl 19 twinks lol @Xaryu
[0:46:14] RS_Reaver: @noxthentus totally
[0:46:15] Meaco: nah. i had one of every class in wotlk
[0:46:16] remarkayble: Sod for me
[0:46:16] ConceptualDesigns: MoP
[0:46:16] parkrangerpeter: they called "alts" for a reason, you're supposed to have them for fun not equally geared/kitted
[0:46:16] kb_h: raid splits
[0:46:17] crazyboy1_: yeah but sod is all about the alts and discover the classies. its not classic era its sod
[0:46:17] Bioaim7: @roxzssx ofc this is classic, what else
[0:46:18] ponaris: I've been doing bfd every reset with my alt and he is 31 that's not that bad
[0:46:18] jgarcia95az: wrath
[0:46:19] ottomonster: wotlk*
[0:46:20] voidtouched_93: thats all wrath classic is tbh now
[0:46:20] hSudz: definitely MOP
[0:46:20] flippittv: mop
[0:46:20] AndersenGGWP: Bro dont cater to these reddit sweats - Im playing ALOT and only have time for 1 char
[0:46:20] chasingshadowsz: i had alts in wrath
[0:46:21] astrix25: this is sod not classic
[0:46:21] Pixelate93: this is SOD
[0:46:21] tbabytheking: wrath with heirloom gear
[0:46:21] iSPEN97: this is season of discovery tho
[0:46:21] Phoenix3215: I had 3 70s in TBC
[0:46:22] ConceptualDesigns: yep
[0:46:22] bottis96: ACCOUNT BUFF IF YOU HAVE A TOON AT MAX LEVEL
[0:46:22] kevo_k: I had hella alts in wrath lol
[0:46:23] Genghish: Wotlk
[0:46:23] kirk_hunts: Twink alts in classic
[0:46:23] Darkdeaths: wrath and cata
[0:46:23] butterwurth: I had alts in cata and wrath
[0:46:23] Grevira: I had 3 alts I used to raid in OG Wrath
[0:46:23] Tomalegendary: WOD?
[0:46:24] Seoken1: Exactly, but this is a seasonal temporary server, we should encourage people playing alts so they can try everything out
[0:46:25] voncline88: in wotlk ALTs were born
[0:46:26] flashingforscuttle: Wrath with RAF
[0:46:26] voncline88: im old
[0:46:28] chillyt616: well this new, not classic. if you wnt this experience got back to classic?
[0:46:28] roxzssx: SoD != classic
[0:46:28] naela1989: but alts keep the leveling world alive
[0:46:30] LJimbox: you can disable the exp buff by tanking to an innkeeper, so if you want to enjoy the original leveling speed you still can @Xaryu
[0:46:30] fetza108: It is a dad game not alt game
[0:46:32] zebercetanayurt: It is sod
[0:46:33] Pixelate93: this is SOD not classic WDYM?
[0:46:34] poopflinger69: wrath season 8 was almost a year one plenty of alts
[0:46:34] kheap_: why are we bringing an old mindset to a new age of players? @xaryu
[0:46:34] Zzeff_Live: I botted in TBC and I still only had 1 character
[0:46:35] Trodenskjold: Alts were 100% a big thing in Cata
[0:46:35] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper. Also this isn't Classic wow. It's a completely new seasonal server.
[0:46:36] liviaaaa: I had 5 lvl 80 it wotlk and I'm not a complete no life
[0:46:36] meguidokun: i have played alts at max lvl since tbc
[0:46:36] radassbadass69: mains are based, I don't understand people's perceived need to play 6 characters at once
[0:46:36] Ddocz: BRING BACK LVL 19 TWINK META
[0:46:39] Reaperz_kinetic: this isn’t classic tho… and I’d rather have alts so that I can experience other classes… imo it’s a bad argument
[0:46:39] detourz28: I still only have 1 main on each faction.
[0:46:40] noxthentus: its not classic tho LUL
[0:46:41] zebercetanayurt: it is sod
[0:46:42] fitethepower: L Take
[0:46:42] Gashunk1: classic+ is a dream
[0:46:43] Seoken1: SoD is not Classic nor Retail, It's SoD
[0:46:44] Pixelate93: this is SOD not classic WDYM? 󠀀
[0:46:44] tbabytheking: its not classic tho its season of discovery
[0:46:45] bamfosaurus: I had an alt in cata, think it was a thing end of wotlk really
[0:46:45] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:46:46] crazyboy1_: its not era tho its sod KEKW
[0:46:46] roxzssx: it's not classic dude
[0:46:47] dado_inc: THIS SOD NOT WOW CLASSIC
[0:46:47] rubbe_jb: SoD is going full retail mode
[0:46:48] jbeemerks: there is too much cool stuff to try out
[0:46:48] voncline88: before WOTLK alts were undergeared maybe twinks not serious characters
[0:46:48] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut Then no one will want to play the game because questing is so sluggish, thats why they added gold boost to try get players to do that, but truth is, no one wants to lvl up
[0:46:50] grylz89: When I played in vanilla 2004, my GM had x2 R14s he was the one with no life @xaryu
[0:46:50] xChiip95: People are so efficient now that alts make sense
[0:46:51] dogmano7: BOTS will be able to level faster, nice!
[0:46:51] wreckedgum: THIS IS SOD. NOT CLASSIC
[0:46:53] buhhguhh: i just got banned for 14 days for buying gold sadge
[0:46:53] Reaperz_kinetic: it’s not classic lol
[0:46:54] kb_h: might be limited to casual guilds without an alt for splits
[0:46:54] Odlin_Twitch: @xaryu what you think about the gdkp changes so far?
[0:46:55] ralphh1541: cooked take
[0:46:55] eskivoart: Xar actualy cookin
[0:46:55] shadowvypers: ive literally levelled hundreds of alts on retail and an xp boost never felt good. Skipped too much of the world that way
[0:46:55] AdamAnt7: and its only been few weeeks
[0:46:56] Dinomight3: these people askign for alts aren't bis or have professions maxed
[0:46:57] iSPEN97: i want to try other classes
[0:46:57] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper. Also, this is not Classic it's SOD.
[0:46:58] baelz: yeah kinda. its a seasonal server
[0:46:58] GotLuck: but its brand new content and people want to experience it all
[0:46:59] fetza108: Back to retail
[0:46:59] tonyg_1103: hc hype hc hype
[0:47:01] Fai_z: I dont even have all classes at max. Literally unplayable...
[0:47:01] jbeemerks: not classic
[0:47:02] dado_inc: THIS IS SOD NOT CLASSSSIC
[0:47:03] Kazay1998: It's SoD, makes you want to try the other classes and see what's new. To me this makes total sense. @Xaryu
[0:47:03] liightzouut: I think they should get rid of SPAMMING dungeons... hell, make it one instance per hour. ALSO they should remove add on's
[0:47:04] DeathToad007: blizzard making bad choices
[0:47:05] zebercetanayurt: this is sod
[0:47:05] unclegez: its a season though with alot of changes coming in and out
[0:47:07] tomfxs: @buhhguhh HAhahaha
[0:47:11] LtSkippy74: I've always had alts I enjoy leveling process
[0:47:13] bakerbaker019: 4 day reset would be nice so we can raid twice a week same day
[0:47:14] Dinomight3: @Dinomight3 and people with more alts maxing alts, will only get bored faster
[0:47:16] c3relki11er: i remember begging my guild to bring my alt into nax in wrath to start to get some raid gear and it was def a different dynamic
[0:47:16] Gashunk1: dado_inc it was supposed to be classic+?
[0:47:22] twitchuser2016: they should do it like in wrath - just let ppl turn off the xp boost (noone will do it anyway)
[0:47:22] cxn_r: @Xaryu I mean, anyone can turn off the XP buff at any time by speaking to an Inkeeper.
[0:47:23] Gennyitalia: between work, family, and dailies I can only play an hour or so a day and in classic era that’s not enough time 😭
[0:47:26] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[0:47:28] Vedros_: except this is SoD, they want to encourage alts, people want to play these classes with the new runes since everything is so experimental
[0:47:28] YaBoy_Lijah: but these characters will most likely be deleted at end of season.. why waste days and weeks on leveling :(
[0:47:31] AdamAnt7: ?
[0:47:31] neomonstr: @cxn_r calm down lad LUL
[0:47:33] grylz89: When I played in vanilla 2004, my GM had x2 R14s he was the one with no life @xaryu
[0:47:34] fetza108: @deathtoad007 yes becausr playerbase are dumb again....
[0:47:34] AdamAnt7: weird take
[0:47:36] bib0u_1: these ppl are just doomers
[0:47:38] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu The arena tournament realms were my favorite thing to exist in WoW because I could PvP on any character at max level without having to level. To me endgame PvP is the infinite content loop and leveling is just in the way of that.
[0:47:39] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:47:40] letsgoforsen123: You have to level in same zones anyway... westfall and deadmines are unavoidable
[0:47:41] kelhorn_: I just think the 25-40 is pretty painful though. The zones are parse and spaming dungeons is not a good leveling experience and the zones are empty
[0:47:42] yung_jed: i agree but its season of DISCOVERY... they want ppl to have alts and try all classes
[0:47:47] cxn_r: @neomonstr ignorant for ignorants sake 'lad'
[0:47:47] Big_Zum: I think it’s because it’s completely not classic anymore and just want people to try all the new items and runes
[0:47:49] Genghish: @gennyitalia aye man your life choices
[0:47:49] DeathToad007: speedrunning classic into retail
[0:47:50] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame thats because everyone wants everything now.... no one wants to grind fopr everything and then complains there isnt any content to do... its weird and people need to learn that everything isnt instantr
[0:47:51] flintstarr: @YaBoy_Lijah Blizz already said they wouldn't just delete them
[0:47:51] kheap_: they literally said they want alts in the blue post @xaryu
[0:47:54] Seoken1: they acutally might though, if the gold rewards are still doubled LUL @Xaryu
[0:47:57] Darkdeaths: @yung_jed I second that
[0:47:58] AdamAnt7: this is good for the game
[0:47:59] Pixelate93: this is SOD not classic WDYM?
[0:47:59] Threeliters: SM burnout
[0:48:01] chillyt616: it really sounds like your the minority here looking at chat lol
[0:48:01] roxzssx: not true
[0:48:03] jbeemerks: it is fun to try all the new stuff.
[0:48:03] Kuja_: So what?
[0:48:04] kirk_hunts: SODCORE NO XP BOOST OR DELETE
[0:48:05] PriorERA: Blizz wants people to experience the new runes/specs.  I don't think it has to do with anything other than that.
[0:48:07] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut because no one cares about taking 6 months to hit max lvl anymore
[0:48:08] Pixelate93: not true
[0:48:09] aackee: if you're doing it because you're enjoying it why not
[0:48:10] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:48:10] bib0u_1: ive played classic so many times i dont need to spend 2000k hrs to lvl
[0:48:11] eskivoart: AFTER FIRST MONTH ITS OK
[0:48:11] Kuja_: Its SoD not classic
[0:48:11] roxzssx: "twist = retail"
[0:48:12] Darkdeaths: SoD to try alts and see different runes
[0:48:13] Seoken1: I mean SoD is technically built on the retail client as the baseline, though.
[0:48:14] Genghish: @gennyitalia i have no wife no job and play wow allday that sux harder
[0:48:15] adam_brisbane: what if the buff only happened to players once they reached 40?
[0:48:17] cxn_r: It's a 1 year-long seasonal server
[0:48:17] auuzib: Classic with a "retail" twist
[0:48:17] easyafff: you got your twist
[0:48:18] Gashunk1: people don't know how to enjoy a game, we gotta go fast to raid lock logging
[0:48:18] Rindu: with retail twist LUL
[0:48:18] Dinomight3: Aggrend said they're 'keeping the feel of vanilla' which this is the opposite of
[0:48:20] wreckedgum: its supposed to be DISCOVERY lol, so let people DSICOVER on everything...
[0:48:23] AdamAnt7: dude people would just stop playing at 40 or 60 or w/e if they cant lvl and alt
[0:48:24] auuzib: Discover how much you miss retail lmao
[0:48:29] budmodeos: My main is level 35 this morning. Why would I log in again until next Tuesday?? I won’t
[0:48:30] Kosmicpanther: Sod is also a season I don’t think it will have the longevity of other versions
[0:48:30] rmac96: as someone who is in school full time and wants to experience each season as it’s out, but also enjoys the grind of the game and leveling, not sure how to feel
[0:48:31] ninetysix: @Xaryu the raid log check is making it more like retail minus
[0:48:31] neomonstr: @cxn_r Spamming your message over and over just for recognition is monkaS
[0:48:32] dado_inc: nope SOD is completly new Game only the world is classic
[0:48:34] iSPEN97: as a warrior main i want to try other classes guzuBeliever
[0:48:34] Bjergby_: Season of discovery, they want people to discover everything and also all the new classes
[0:48:38] tonyg_1103: hc hype hc hype
[0:48:40] voidtouched_93: 6 alts sounds like he has enough time for 1-2 more at 40 haha
[0:48:42] AmazeJ: retail doesnt have mage heals warlock/rogue tanks
[0:48:43] eskivoart: Hold an in game poll blizzard
[0:48:43] Seoken1: @Bjergby_ THIS
[0:48:46] cxn_r: @neomonstr my guy you say lad and monkaS I know fr you're lonely
[0:48:46] kenmi2: I think this is all a test phase for a classic plus. they want maximum experimentation across all classes and players
[0:48:46] Vedros_: right but the point of Sod is experimenting with these new class runes, they said in their blue post they want to encourage alts
[0:48:48] frnkdndy: Another take is that it is annoying to loosing loot to others ALT when i havn't even got any gear on my main
[0:48:51] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame then maybe they should go play retail? the whole p[oint of classic is the slower and open world experience...
[0:48:52] Gennyitalia: @genghish very true! I just wanna hit max level relatively with others but I definitely see the downside to it 😅
[0:48:53] tbabytheking: the entire point of sod is to try new things. gotta be used to change
[0:48:54] fetza108: Sadly they are discovering what classic+ they wanted to be with alpha test gameplay LUL
[0:48:54] RS_Reaver: I think people want to experience all the new runes and playstyles, it doesn't have to be like vanilla
[0:48:56] neomonstr: @cxn_r KEKW
[0:48:57] Big_Zum: it’s really just a beta for classic plus
[0:49:02] SoSoBurrito: I want to beat the game but I don't want to play th
[0:49:03] itkbutt3rs: I main and have always (since wotlk) mained a Pala tank I want to level RDPS next should I pick mage hunter or lock?
[0:49:03] budmodeos: yeah
[0:49:03] AdamAnt7: you are not seeing the big picture ..we get it it sok
[0:49:04] wreckedgum: i miss that
[0:49:06] SoSoBurrito: e game HUH
[0:49:07] budmodeos: agreed Xaryu
[0:49:10] chasingshadowsz: AMAZIN
[0:49:12] blasphemousfaith: true
[0:49:13] Gashunk1: RPG?
[0:49:13] baileyyalexx: pshero still only plays rogue
[0:49:14] ShutrMcGavin: Tons of people don't like all the alts
[0:49:15] Dinomight3: they're taking the RPG out of the mmorpg
[0:49:16] astrix25: 2024 bruh
[0:49:19] darthpooki: it only doesnt bother us because we are the minority of the playerbase that plays a majority of every day of the week
[0:49:19] Seoken1: For streamers yes, for the general public, No
[0:49:19] lHlUlLlK: CRINGE
[0:49:21] biki2112: it also solves the meta chasing
[0:49:23] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut So your just going to ignore when I said that in 2019 everyone spammed dungeons and almost nobody was questing because people dont care about lvling outside of HC
[0:49:23] Gashunk1: Keepo
[0:49:24] iLtDan: 100 percent agree
[0:49:25] inhaledthc: yeah now i play rogue dont have time for alts
[0:49:26] fetza108: @big_zum it is not even beta bro...
[0:49:28] Seoken1: Thats streamer logic vs regular person logic @Xaryu
[0:49:28] parmejohn__: @xaryu t's because you only like mage tho. What if new runes make new classes appealing? Especially for a new player.
[0:49:28] Reaperz_kinetic: the only thing limiting alts does is limiting players to how much they can enjoy the game overall I think that’s an L concept making the XP buff a W
[0:49:29] Genghish: I tune in to Xaryu because he sounds like a gnome
[0:49:32] glizzygoblinfr: who is blud yappin to
[0:49:32] Shajaa: @xaryu a lot of their recent changes make me think they just want p2 shorter then p1 which was too long.
[0:49:35] tbabytheking: eh i'd rather have time to play every fun class i want to play
[0:49:36] Astralthundr: Its also only been 1 month.... like that's it....this xp buff is stupid this early
[0:49:37] Phoenix3215: Endgame is not always the goal
[0:49:37] Kuja_: Its not classic wow man its sod
[0:49:37] AdamAnt7: it still takes alot of time..bruh just amking it more acceable
[0:49:37] kelloggsfrostie: So true
[0:49:38] Eon_Ltd: I agree
[0:49:40] t1isokatleague: stv event drops mount?
[0:49:40] dado_inc: IS NOT CLASSIC WOW !
[0:49:40] auuzib: Watch swifty warrior vids at 12 yrs old was ICONIC xarGasm xarGasm
[0:49:41] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:49:42] astrix25: this isn’t classic
[0:49:43] Gashunk1: agree
[0:49:44] heyitsken_: xaryu are the mage guy  to me ohneH
[0:49:44] arrkies91: People having many alts etc and not one main are the ones who cant decide if they have a dick or a p*ussy
[0:49:44] dannyp19921: @Xaryu AGREED A 100 %, Xaryu ! Preach, brother !!!
[0:49:45] roxzssx: sod is not classic
[0:49:46] Dinomight3: @dado_inc yes it is mfer
[0:49:48] unclegez: its a season though.. this isnt meant to be "classic" its for trying new things etc
[0:49:48] Gashunk1: it was supposed to be classic+?
[0:49:51] Parametik: this isnt classic
[0:49:52] tonyg_1103: hc hype hc hype
[0:49:54] meguidokun: but this aint classic tho is it
[0:49:56] pattythepaladin: play classic then and not sod KEKW
[0:49:56] rmac96: as someone who is in school full time and wants to experience each season as it’s out, but also enjoys the grind of the game and leveling, not sure how to feel
[0:49:57] cxn_r: @unclegez ^
[0:49:57] arthilin: @Xaryu i'm a casual and i personally like having 1 main to care about. i guess i would personally only lvla alt when i'm raid locking solely for 1 or 2 bis
[0:49:57] Parametik: 2019 wasnt classic either
[0:49:58] kenmi2: I think this is all a test phase for a classic plus. they want maximum experimentation across all classes and players
[0:49:58] Rindu: in classic era people were spamming dungeons too the majority doesn't care about leveling unless HC :)
[0:49:59] AdamAnt7: @arrkies91 EZ BLOCK
[0:50:03] jbeemerks: how are we supposed to pick a class if we don’t try them all?
[0:50:03] spandlemo: I enjoy knowing that a certain person in my guild is a certain class
[0:50:04] Mavzerick: Season of Retail
[0:50:05] Bjergby_: They want people to discover new classes
[0:50:08] Bioaim7: how dumb are people writing "this is not classc wow"
[0:50:09] gentlesoaps: the classes are all fun. i want to dabble in them a little bit and the xp buff helps see more
[0:50:13] moka_master: oddly the pressure to level and play alts just leads to more of an empty feeling in the game, like all you are doing is rinse and repeat over and over
[0:50:14] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame yeah ... and guess who the first people who stopped playing and complained that there wasnt anything to do in classic.... it was streamers and "content" creators
[0:50:20] arrkies91: @AdamAnt7 ONE GUY SPOTTED
[0:50:23] FunTrain: Constantly giving the people what they want is what killed retail. And politics
[0:50:24] kelloggsfrostie: It's like SoD is becoming a classic experience for retail players.
[0:50:28] Astralthundr: This is literally classic+ lol
[0:50:28] ripprrooster: No alts in classic would be great
[0:50:29] JukezZA: theres nothing wrong with finishing the game and doing something else until something new comes out
[0:50:30] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut there the ones who play the most dude....
[0:50:32] tbabytheking: bro that's the entire point of sod lol
[0:50:33] dado_inc: NOT CLASSIC WOW !!!!!!!! IS SOD ... when you wanna play CLASSIC play it on vanilla server
[0:50:35] Seoken1: True, they can go play Classic. Those servers are available, this is SoD
[0:50:38] willsmiled: its already not classic
[0:50:38] samuxtv: Couldn't you make the same arguement and just say then go play classic?
[0:50:39] ralphh1541: bro SoD is a modernized version of classic wtf
[0:50:40] TodBobertson: That's what SoD is rofl.
[0:50:41] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:50:43] colt420x: Its not classic... its SOD
[0:50:44] iSPEN97: weird take
[0:50:45] Gashunk1: same trajectory as the expansions, why are we reliving it again
[0:50:45] roxzssx: sod is not classic tho
[0:50:45] kevo_k: its not classic lmao
[0:50:46] mjNeeno: its sod tho not classic
[0:50:49] druib: Too many changes. :-(!
[0:50:49] lHlUlLlK: this is SOD little bro not classic WoW
[0:50:49] easyafff: bad take
[0:50:50] donzy986: that's exactly what happened with retail....lmfao
[0:50:50] roxzssx: bad take tbh
[0:50:51] jbeemerks: @dado_inc big true
[0:50:52] i_am_cakes: @kelloggsfrostie wow, this is the fucking truth. i never thought of it this way.
[0:50:54] YaBoy_Lijah: i think they should have reduced xp by -100%
[0:50:54] sorzhx: they should just turn a toggle on/off and its a non conversation
[0:50:55] kaleeb_uli: They made classic into SOD your point doesnt make sense
[0:50:55] Bioaim7: SOD IS CLASSIC YOU DUMB
[0:50:55] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame you think asmon was someone who played the most?
[0:50:57] t1isokatleague: WAOW
[0:50:57] Bioaim7: chat
[0:50:57] Nezhoni: chat Pepega
[0:51:01] jgarcia95az: what’s the xp buff
[0:51:03] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu They described this March 5th patch as a "midpoint" of phase 2 btw so that might mean it's going to be a relatively short phase. We could be seeing P3 as early as April which would also explain the need for the experience buff.
[0:51:04] Nezhoni: PepegaPls
[0:51:04] liightzouut: you think Xaryu plays the most now?
[0:51:04] aoe_enjoyer: just think about 40-50 then 60 Aware
[0:51:04] realxRusty: SOD = CLASSIC with extra steps get over it
[0:51:06] itsagamerelax: the current xp buff only goes to 25 though right?
[0:51:07] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut people have quit more not being able to reach endgame then people who didn't because its to much of a slog, that is a truth
[0:51:09] ebuns: its not claasic ... far from it , played classic back in the days and SoD is far from that
[0:51:09] dammitcyrus: This isnt Classic tho not even remotely close its called SoD for a reason its literally just like Season of Mastery and they released a 50% xp buff off launch
[0:51:11] Flowzen123: more changes like this and it will be more like retail and not classic
[0:51:12] saveslol: I agree that era should be harder for leveling alts. Seasons are classic “with a twist” and this is part of the twist.
[0:51:13] Kuja_: They are
[0:51:14] KingCiolan: this isnt classic, fuck 40 man raids nobody has time to organise 40 man guilds again for the 3rd time
[0:51:20] Clayray53: @xaryu I do see your point. however, this isn’t classic. this is not classic, it’s a different version of classic. just i@o
[0:51:21] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:51:22] unclegez: this isnt a long term season..
[0:51:23] Clayray53: imo*
[0:51:24] Genghish: Everyone saying "its not classic" wtf u on about? Its litteraly the exact same world get ourra hete
[0:51:26] SuaSponte: there was an xp buff in season of mastery
[0:51:27] seukas: 40 man raids suck
[0:51:29] Gashunk1: don't kill the world again
[0:51:29] Darksyde1029: @Xaryu They described this March 5th patch as a "midpoint" of phase 2 btw so that might mean it's going to be a relatively short phase. We could be seeing P3 as early as April which would also explain the need for the experience buff..
[0:51:31] cxn_r: You're thinking long term for a server that will last 1 year.
[0:51:34] AdamAnt7: long tearm its a great move
[0:51:37] aoe_enjoyer: devs are discovering too
[0:51:37] poopflinger69: SoD will die when they stop making content
[0:51:40] Big_Zum: long term xp boost is great. more alts more people playing
[0:51:40] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame thats because everyone wants everything now and burnt them selves out of content by spamming ?
[0:51:40] Rindu: stonks
[0:51:42] Dinomight3: good take
[0:51:47] iSPEN97: as a warrior main i would like to play other classes aswell, its a bit lack lustering in pvp guzuBeliever  @Xaryu
[0:51:48] voidtouched_93: the leather one is so ugly lol
[0:51:48] geminuspr: Xar plays 1 class no alts ofc he not gonna like the exp buff KEKW
[0:51:51] graziNNN: it's a gnome device
[0:51:53] bruciebones: @Xaryu i think the runes make up for any time lost 'experiencing classic;' tbh
[0:51:53] t1isokatleague: looks better on gnome
[0:51:54] Beakz______: ppl find the craziest shit to complain about
[0:51:56] seukas: looks badass
[0:51:56] lolyrros: they destroyed wow by splitting the played base. back to lirking i go
[0:51:58] Shajaa: @xaryu Idk about this take considering you went gonna do SODCOR because if the time commitment
[0:51:58] Dinomight3: @voidtouched_93 classic drip baby
[0:52:00] Amittyville: nice dress
[0:52:01] Vanjince: why they say they increase the 50% xp buff (1-39) to 100%, when the 50% xp buff is acutally only active for 1-24?
[0:52:01] sdotpuff: They made mounts cheaper too?
[0:52:01] ralphh1541: the LW helm looks fucking atrocious
[0:52:04] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:52:04] jayjaydplane: SeemsGood saiyan cosplay
[0:52:05] Gashunk1: we going to be teleported between instances soon enough and Azeroth will wilt away
[0:52:05] bloodsnaill: it’s a tailoring item from an engineering base of course it looks like engineering
[0:52:07] ShruniWasTaken: @Xaryu that's the problem though.  it's a seasonal server, so "long term" is a thing we're sure of
[0:52:09] Kosmicpanther: yea I don’t think there is a “long term” for sod since it’s a seasonal realm
[0:52:09] Genghish: @ispen97 u dont sound like a warrior main man up soldier
[0:52:09] Kuja_: Based
[0:52:10] AdamAnt7: this will keep server alive for along time
[0:52:12] Seoken1: xarPrime xarPrime
[0:52:12] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut no its because people dont care about taking a long time to hit endgame, maybe you do, but majority of people seriously dont care
[0:52:15] bib0u_1: pretty much
[0:52:15] lHlUlLlK: TRUEEEEEEEE
[0:52:16] i_am_cakes: @seukas 40 man raids make it viable for lots of different classes and specs to show up. the less players in the raid the more "optimal" it has to become.
[0:52:18] samuxtv: Literally what i just said
[0:52:19] roxzssx: you said sod i classic tho
[0:52:19] willsmiled: exactly
[0:52:19] lHlUlLlK: FACTS
[0:52:19] Seoken1: Spot on
[0:52:19] auuzib: Gigachad
[0:52:20] graziNNN: sod > era
[0:52:21] Rindu: GIGACHAD
[0:52:22] lHlUlLlK: TRUEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:52:24] daschadwick: morning xar morning chat
[0:52:24] ralphh1541: THIS IS THE CORRECT TAKE
[0:52:25] brodiebrohan: hot take, the game is better without alts. all of barny’s story wouldn’t have happened if he was just leveling alts
[0:52:27] lHlUlLlK: SPOT ON
[0:52:27] bobbiesmals: w take
[0:52:28] t1isokatleague: IMA SEND YOU BACK TO ERA
[0:52:29] SabooCS: @graziNNN haha
[0:52:31] Smoothiez_: this is exactly what i was thinking when you were talking lol
[0:52:34] meguidokun: literally what some of us where saying lol
[0:52:40] Big_Zum: people were already starting to raid log gnomer 3 weeks later lol this xp boost keeps the world alive
[0:52:40] t1isokatleague: ERA IS OLD
[0:52:41] Kuja_: #GoPlayEra
[0:52:42] Fai_z: Isn't SoD supposed to be Classic+? I think that's what most people want.
[0:52:42] Vanjince: @i_am_cakes u played a classic era 40man raid? 25 warrys stacked lol
[0:52:43] thebus7: Re-subbing my usual Prime with you for YOU HAVING THE RIGHT TAKE ON THIS - cant believe the hype around the 100% increase - very outside of "Classic" move - this move is Blizzard saying "this isnt classic, you are all just beta testing new specs"
[0:52:44] iSPEN97: @Genghish yeah no but if you play warriro you would know what happens to you inv pvp with all the casters
[0:52:45] DeathToad007: people are so fuckign dumb
[0:52:45] Seoken1: I think the difference is SoD is temporary, retail is not temporary @Xaryu
[0:52:46] Astralthundr: You can already go from 25 to 40 in a weekend by spamming, people saying they don't have time is ridiculous
[0:52:46] Zuggith: yourre wrong people are happy get over it xar
[0:52:46] Nellz3r: disagree, this is a dumb argument.  exactly, season of discovery is classic plus, not retail minus
[0:52:47] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame then why do those same people complain about not having anything to do 4 days after a new phase?
[0:52:48] tacodoc: Ideally it would be a little more than Era and a little less than tbc
[0:52:51] Nezhoni: chat always has the worst takes
[0:52:55] bloodsnaill: lvling fast doesn’t really matter since we have artificially long leveling because of the level phases
[0:52:56] Loodimus: I agree and disagree. Its season of discovery and the most fun I have been having is playing and leveling alts. I like this way to expedited discovering all these different classes and runes
[0:52:57] lHlUlLlK: sod is not classic era
[0:52:59] geminuspr: @Xaryu They want ppl to level alts not raid log . Its really simple
[0:52:59] thebus7: thebus7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Re-subbing my usual Prime with you for YOU HAVING THE RIGHT TAKE ON THIS - cant believe the hype around the 100% increase - very outside of "Classic" move - this move is Blizzard saying "this isnt classic, you are all just beta testing new specs"
[0:53:00] lHlUlLlK: TRUEEEEEE
[0:53:00] kelloggsfrostie: @i_am_cakes For real man.
[0:53:03] roxzssx: sod is not classic
[0:53:03] radassbadass69: the actual core playerbase is rightfully concerned these over compensation QOL changes will kill what makes vanilla special
[0:53:03] DeathToad007: i do
[0:53:07] AdamAnt7: it is
[0:53:08] eskivoart: a divided playerbase as always
[0:53:09] i_am_cakes: @Vanjince i def did 40 man raids in classic. it was awesome
[0:53:11] richdawg: agreed xaryu
[0:53:11] roxzssx: it's not
[0:53:12] SabooCS: But its more Retail
[0:53:13] Kuja_: Wrong
[0:53:16] hasox12: yes
[0:53:16] Bioaim7: agreed
[0:53:16] dado_inc: I PLAY ERA 20 years ago.... and now i PLAY SOD !!! other game !! only SAME WORLD
[0:53:19] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut people aren't...that is something you just making up or seeing some forums post and then your = that to like 1000s of others, but people want to lvl alts but not take a long time
[0:53:20] Genghish: @ispen97 play 2 warriors u just need pots like we always did
[0:53:22] roxzssx: sod is closer to retail
[0:53:22] alrik_plays: i love that we're telling each other "go play xxx instead" since WoW launch in 2005 forums
[0:53:23] Parametik: agree to disagree
[0:53:25] lHlUlLlK: you're fried
[0:53:25] seukas: @i_am_cakes i understand the benefits of 40 man. but it basically means all the fights have to be loot pinatas which i would like something more engaging then that
[0:53:27] Seoken1: We talk about it being the journey...more people will play alts thus making the journey feel more alive, massive W
[0:53:28] indistinct: @SabooCS it definitely isnt haha
[0:53:29] bib0u_1: so just be in  a dungeon 24/7 until ur 40 like classic
[0:53:30] SabooCS: Retail Spells Retail mechanics
[0:53:30] t1isokatleague: retail has weird lore
[0:53:31] kb_h: SoD power creep has squashed the relevance of classic items so people just want to get to the good stuff
[0:53:32] auuzib: SoD gonna be "classic" era with retail QoL minus RDF/LFR.  I got 10 bucks on it.  The mount cost and XP buff proves my point
[0:53:35] blasphemousfaith: i love classic leveling and hate end game
[0:53:35] hulkdieselx: bad take. let the era andys rot on era with their "rules"
[0:53:38] TerrortheToast: if you enjoy playing it, just play it :) im having a LOT of fun either way
[0:53:38] SabooCS: WoW Token will come too
[0:53:41] graziNNN: how is sod classic close to retail? lol
[0:53:41] AdamAnt7: a litle xp boost just takes a little drudgery outta grinding lvls
[0:53:42] SabooCS: Sadge
[0:53:46] streyeker: @Xaryu  are you going to play ssf hardcore?
[0:53:48] willsmiled: at what point does classic nott become classic? is it the xp boost or is it me casting chaos bolt in classic wow?
[0:53:49] nickylas: to be fair, era isnt always enjoyable and so far no one in my communities have complained about the xp boost
[0:53:49] Forgiw: please level up 3-4 character to lvl 40 and argue about xp boost after that
[0:53:49] jakeo92: Good luck with STV boss, just a tip: don't try and kite it out of STV, it teleports back to spawn
[0:53:51] TurdBurgison: isnt the xp buff removeable?
[0:53:52] nezt1: many people many opinions
[0:53:53] lashaniquajackson: given that were locked at 40, i think the xp boost is a decent qol so we dont have to get bored leveling the same way we just leveled 3 weeks ago
[0:53:55] Clayray53: I agree it should be, however sod is working towards retail. The runes are not something new to the game, they’re mostly retail versions/spells.
[0:53:57] Armaerei: It's literally a "season" of classic wow.. it's not a dragonflight or wotlk season
[0:53:58] tacodoc: 40 man raids are more fun, but they need to make it challenging enough to be interesting
[0:53:59] aackee: sod is pretty much wrath 2.0
[0:54:00] HeavyLiftin: I think that making the game level-banded kind of degrades the whole "leveling experience" part of the game, and that's why these opinions are cropping up.
[0:54:02] Reinert7284: I think the xp boost is good so more people are playing more alts giving blizz more feedback for more content and idea
[0:54:03] Dragunstorm15: but then why give retail abilities so this is classic+ the orgiinal goal is to make it more "retail"
[0:54:07] Vanjince: @SabooCS wow token is completly fine, when there is no gdkp. why not let ppl spend there hard earned gold for a token
[0:54:07] faineant24: so living flame is a good rune or no?
[0:54:07] bloodsnaill: sod I closer to retail In the worst way trying to get into raids you need raider io scores and GS and full clear before you are 40
[0:54:12] DeathToad007: lag is becasue peopel are stakcinbg on boss
[0:54:12] ogMansoN: everyone thought it would be classic+ adding hyjal maybe, seems like theyre adding more and more retail stuff
[0:54:12] syntackx: They released Dragonflgiht then all these other projects and abandoned retail @Xaryu
[0:54:13] bib0u_1: just run SM 500 times like classic
[0:54:13] AdamAnt7: yes 100 % was way more fun before everyone try to min max
[0:54:17] yegnud: I think with the constant meta changing in each phase it's nice to have some catch up mechanics like what they've added. If warrior gets nuked in p2, I can now more easily level up something else to play
[0:54:18] b4ck13: Everytime something from SoD or Classic drops all i read is Crying and flaming of Blizzard
[0:54:19] bundi222: its on ur reddit
[0:54:22] Seoken1: LOVE IT
[0:54:24] DNuKeM91: @Xaryu havnt lagged for few days STV
[0:54:25] ralphh1541: W
[0:54:25] lolyrros: lets just keep splitting the player base and having people argue about what to play and do
[0:54:26] Aramec: are they even gonna release new server for season of mastery?
[0:54:28] SilverBugeye: @Xaryu exactly my guy  STV and lag is tash
[0:54:29] YaBoy_Lijah: @Xaryu thoughts on if blizz removed NPC mobs in STV event?
[0:54:29] chillyt616: either way you crack it, your living in a dungeon. now they just shortened the time. every1 that plays wow has almost always "tried" to play as optimally as possible
[0:54:30] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame soooo..... instead of making dungeons the way to do that they should be doing what they are doing. increase XP from OPEN WORLD quests. reduce trhe amount of dungeons people can AFK boost or spam
[0:54:33] BarberSnipez: everyone is gonna have TF now :(
[0:54:34] jbeemerks: SoD should be its own thing. Classic+ not retail-
[0:54:38] Atripla: @Xaryu have you had your AG1 today ?
[0:54:39] Seoken1: My guild has 50 active raiders and we were super worried about 40 man rosters @Xaryu
[0:54:41] t1isokatleague: the actual ppl playing sod dont rant on here
[0:54:42] ralphh1541: Nobody wants to organize 40 man raids anymore, it kills any fun
[0:54:46] AdamAnt7: ofc its fine
[0:54:48] radassbadass69: watch MC 20 man is just unchanged MC 40 man, only difference is a player cap LUL
[0:54:49] Sithwith: Another streamer I was watching Dash had a good idea on this, you get the XP boost only after reaching max level on your main toon and then you can have alts with xp boost
[0:54:49] batchestspam: @xaryu got 2k coins in one event, 5x mages with mass regen spamming AE on the boss LOA
[0:54:49] liightzouut: make the MMORPG feel alive again and make people leave dungeron instances
[0:54:52] DeathToad007: they cant change aq or naxx its too hard to scale they already said it
[0:54:54] krz_tv: have you seen the dick pic i sent you on instagram DMs ?
[0:54:55] AdamAnt7: what we gona do 40 man that is not viable
[0:54:57] i_am_cakes: @seukas i mean, it would totally be a pinata if they didnt make some changes to the bosses health, armor, and resistances. they'd have to make changes, because we're powerful as hell right now
[0:54:59] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut maybe your new to wow and everything is new to you, but majority of players have done this lvl exp to many times, its not "new" the gnomer is new, the runes at 40 is new, everything is new mostly at 40
[0:55:00] kirk_hunts: LEAVE THEM
[0:55:02] handy_grenade: idt they can
[0:55:05] TokerTy420: make 40mans great again!!
[0:55:10] AdamAnt7: anyone crying for 40 man dosent get it
[0:55:10] TurdBurgison: would prob reduce lag
[0:55:11] IamCaptainAmerica: @Xaryu i typically have GHOST Greens, how do you like the AG1 is it worth the price?
[0:55:13] t1isokatleague: 40 man u get no loot
[0:55:13] cptnraz: People like the idea of 40 man - raid until they themselves have to raid lead and get 40 people to join a raid haha!
[0:55:14] Kazay1998: @batchestspam AE?
[0:55:17] Kuja_: ??? What do you mean in the short term
[0:55:18] Joxtirol: tbh 40 man is too much people 20-25 is best raid size
[0:55:19] kirk_hunts: It makes the event hilarious when a level 44 panther is griefing you
[0:55:21] Kazay1998: @Kazay1998 oh nvm,
[0:55:23] batchestspam: @kazay1998 arcane explosion
[0:55:26] t1isokatleague: i want loot not more people
[0:55:28] Kuja_: or level another alt
[0:55:29] AdamAnt7: noo
[0:55:30] lukeclev: dude why not let us like this
[0:55:30] Kazay1998: @batchestspam yeye got it straight after hjaha
[0:55:31] streyeker: @Xaryu  are you going to play ssf hardcore?
[0:55:32] yung_jed: or level another alt????
[0:55:32] colt420x: Lmao
[0:55:32] DeathToad007: so may people are going to eb complaining they ahve nothing to do
[0:55:32] radassbadass69: If the exp buff is the only thing that'd bring you back you were never someone who was gonna stick around to begin with
[0:55:32] Parametik: its all. subjective
[0:55:34] aackee: it def is long term tho
[0:55:34] adam_brisbane: but isnt that what blizzard want people to play shorterm and buy a subscription?
[0:55:34] bloodsnaill: I’ve aoe farmed mobs for 1k coins each event only npc mobs only
[0:55:34] gooseflesh: quality over quantity
[0:55:34] kuruga70: nah will p[aly more alts
[0:55:34] killawatts75: but you need to do BGS and stuff end game
[0:55:34] samuxtv: I mean you still have to grind WSG and AB, people will still play
[0:55:35] FullBuckNasty: We've already leveled these levels several times...
[0:55:36] ahskrogue: But we are gonna hit 40
[0:55:37] Xronik07: hi xar
[0:55:37] BergEsquire: They should make a double XP weekend or month
[0:55:38] plaidshorts: nice for alts
[0:55:39] chobinhood_: 1-40 is going to be like 20-30 hours of gameplay.
[0:55:41] BergEsquire: not permanent
[0:55:42] jgarcia95az: what’s the ex plug
[0:55:42] Kuja_: We just play more alts instead
[0:55:43] CruchTV: @kuruga70 liar
[0:55:43] e7icarium: miss it
[0:55:47] Zerksyera: quit sooner or start an alt sooner
[0:55:49] Seoken1: ehh maybe I guess
[0:55:51] AdamAnt7: you have it wwrong..they were gonna hit 40 and quit befopre..now they can keep playing and do and alt now
[0:55:52] FlyingKangaroo_: i already did quit, with the xp boost i am coming back
[0:55:52] Beakz______: 100%%%
[0:55:52] Parametik: hit 40 lvl annother cause its fun not a cave grind in sm
[0:55:53] jgarcia95az: xp buff *
[0:55:54] ahskrogue: people who think leveling is too slow now are more likely to even quit before hitting 40 @Xaryu
[0:55:55] b4ck13: People at 40 quit because its impossible to get a group in this elitist 6/6 99 parse pug hell
[0:55:56] Dragunstorm15: no your going to hit 40 and want to level another character
[0:55:58] lukeclev: xar its ok to like the buff
[0:55:58] krienth: HUH
[0:55:58] Pilky02: huh
[0:55:59] Jonnist: HUH
[0:55:59] yung_jed: @FlyingKangaroo_ this
[0:56:00] ShotFake: You need the short term to survive before the long term
[0:56:03] Degran: Why does the XP boot matter? Just shut it off at the inn.
[0:56:04] i_am_cakes: that xp buff is what is going to give me the will to lvl my alt
[0:56:04] daschadwick: pause
[0:56:05] Kuja_: Weirdge take
[0:56:06] Big_Zum: the people that hit 40 and quit has already happened. this keeps the people that are still playing able to enjoy more classes…
[0:56:07] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame or maybe im more a purest and if i think people complaining about not having content because they SPAM duingeons for 5 days straight and dont weant to do that again should be whining on forums for XP buffs
[0:56:09] ShruniWasTaken: @Xaryu Seasonal servers are short term no?, Long term is servers shutting down, Like with SoM
[0:56:10] faineant24: how out of touch are you with the normal playerbase?
[0:56:11] AceOfFlame: @b4ck13 no one is asking you for 99 parsers
[0:56:12] buzja: whoa
[0:56:13] t1isokatleague: fake
[0:56:16] Kazay1998: wait
[0:56:18] Kazay1998: wtf
[0:56:19] graziNNN: must be nice being a mage
[0:56:22] AdamAnt7: @Dragunstorm15 exactly this is what im saying he dosent get it
[0:56:23] saund: meanwhile warriors get 100
[0:56:25] bloodsnaill: that’s a mage aoe group for sure

[0:56:29] miciahclay: 5 mage mass regen
[0:56:30] chobinhood_: nah thats not fake
[0:56:31] blind3d_: not fake lol
[0:56:31] graziNNN: It's real, and stupid
[0:56:31] ConceptualDesigns: AoE farming maybe?
[0:56:32] iLtDan: 5 mages aoe farm
[0:56:32] miciahclay: AE spam

[0:56:35] Joxtirol: i got 1000 as a solo rogue
[0:56:35] CruchTV: SM grind is sleeper dad gamers shit on open world pvp call it griefing there is no win for the sod gamer you guys cant make up your minds
[0:56:35] bloodsnaill: all mages we got 2k
[0:56:36] auuzib: Yall are gonna get SoD stuck in classic era but theyre gonna do ALL the QoL that retail has without RDF/LFR. Im willing to bet even the LFG Pane will stay so people dont have to spam trade chat xD
[0:56:37] lukeclev: xar, its ok to like the xp buff
[0:56:38] ponaris: It's real done 3200 the other day
[0:56:38] aerodynam1c: aoe farm the boss altar.
[0:56:38] SlapdickWoWplayer: just farm altar
[0:56:40] namesbuck: i got 1400 by myself at the altar last night
[0:56:41] DeathToad007: mage living flame spame
[0:56:41] liightzouut: like... no one is forcing you to keep playing and make more ALTs
[0:56:41] SteffeHaGG: AoE at altar with 5 mages, spawning together. Works like a charm
[0:56:42] batchestspam: IM TELLING YOU HOW
[0:56:42] chobinhood_: rez together, aoe the altar with boss nearby
[0:56:43] cptnraz: Boss + AOE on altar
[0:56:44] blind3d_: @batchestspam this
[0:56:44] orrenico: I got 1.2k as melee cleave
[0:56:44] Parametik: mages go oom
[0:56:44] Clayray53: long term tbh…bro you gotta think 70-80% of your viewers aren’t full time streamers or full time gamers. We have jobs/school/kids. I know you have a job as a streamer, but 95% of us aren’t a full time streamer actually making a living off of it. I personally play for MAYBE 1-2 hours a day.
[0:56:44] DangerPOM: 2k today as a mage aoe
[0:56:45] chrislu18: I at least hope they don't implement boosts from 40-60 later on
[0:56:45] t1isokatleague: WTF DUDE
[0:56:45] graziNNN: Mass regen
[0:56:45] holymuffin90: 5 mages 5x mass regen
[0:56:47] bloodsnaill: mass regen AE
[0:56:48] SoSoBurrito: $25 bloodcoin season pass YEP
[0:56:48] Seoken1: I have gone 2800 before (Non AoE), so 4700 is not unreasonable
[0:56:48] batchestspam: READ MY MESSAGES
[0:56:49] FIREMAGZZ: 1000 percent true
[0:56:50] danielbanks: I got 6.5k coins yesterday
[0:56:51] namesbuck: if boss is around
[0:56:52] FlynnFluff: @xaryu I get maybe 1 to 2 lvls when I get to play Sod without the xp buff I wouldn’t be sticking with it because without it I don’t have the time to get caught up and by the time 60 would come out everyone would be elitist
[0:56:52] miciahclay: 5 Mass Regen is the play
[0:56:52] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:56:53] snoozzzzzzzzzz: total for the group maybe ?
[0:56:53] FaluranTV: sit on top of walls

[0:56:56] Lewbra: yeah idk thats what i've been doing every event I get a ton
[0:56:57] themarshalTV: ICANT
[0:57:01] Kuja_: you need to have the boss close too
[0:57:02] bloodsnaill: mass regen you can’t die
[0:57:03] voidtouched_93: just don’t die, EZ
[0:57:04] orrenico: ZG altar and you stay up oni the hill
[0:57:05] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut then good for you, you like taking a long time to hit 40, thats great, if you like that...great...but your living in a vast minority where people no longer want to spend 100s of hours to hit what everyone wants to be at
[0:57:05] maagnusz1: go kill blood god pls
[0:57:06] cutaway1: 5 mass regen + living flame with boss buff
[0:57:06] cptnraz: All doing mass regen, + aoe + boss near altar
[0:57:07] dextuhx: huh?
[0:57:08] liightzouut: @liightzouut like... no one is forcing you to keep playing and make more ALTs.... like go outside or something
[0:57:08] Spijker84: if the boss is there you get like 20+ per kill
[0:57:08] phL64_: my best was 2,2k
[0:57:10] FIREMAGZZ: 5 mages don’t die as fast as
[0:57:10] batchestspam: @xaryu YOU NEED TO ALL USE MASS REGEN
[0:57:10] ConceptualDesigns: maybe it was cheezed for science purposes
[0:57:10] Necrosis1991: 5 mages
[0:57:11] kirk_hunts: These 5 mage mass regen groups
[0:57:13] americanbornchild: NotLikeThis
[0:57:16] AdamAnt7: the res is so close you get to spot on stairs before debuff comes off
[0:57:16] dextuhx: you just all respawn at the same time, and blast wave the alter
[0:57:17] Seoken1: They may also have out of group support healers hiding behind trees in the distance
[0:57:17] plsnojebait: YOU CAN USE MASSREGEN AND REWIND TIME YOU CANT DIE
[0:57:17] ponaris: @xaryu all mages res st the same time all use mass Regen and blast spam
[0:57:19] maagnusz1: just do a group and get kbs
[0:57:19] themarshalTV: x5 mass regen on gcd + arcane explosion
[0:57:20] chillyt616: you get heals from all explosions
[0:57:20] Sirmoney1: You eat and drink while you have the inmune... Then you have full HP and mana.
[0:57:24] miciahclay: Nah, 5 mass regen + AE, you go oom before you die
[0:57:26] Execrable1: yes
[0:57:27] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:57:32] bojack359: Sup xaryu? How's today going?
[0:57:32] batchestspam: 5x mass regen and arcane explosion
[0:57:35] chillyt616: every mage works off eachothres regen
[0:57:37] Felenden: you mass regen as 5 - pop Blast Wave and then spam arcane explsion until you die run back repeat\
[0:57:37] bloodyjoker420: What's up
[0:57:37] dingerdoom: what is bro gonna do with all the coins? quit sooner? KEKW
[0:57:40] Rindu: @Sirmoney1 4Head
[0:57:40] batchestspam: you get thousands
[0:57:44] thebus7: You take at all about how the EXP buff will flood servers even more with Bots....
[0:57:44] batchestspam: if coins
[0:57:45] FIREMAGZZ: DO IT XARYU 5 mages next stv for science
[0:57:46] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame like i said... people want everything now and instant. because thats how people game now. but thats not what classic is supposed to be
[0:57:47] Diddly_dope: howd kai sleep??
[0:57:53] Quaztopher: I don’t think you can kill the boss lol
[0:57:54] AdamAnt7: news flash ..we wont kill the boss
[0:57:59] erectiliann: @xaryu never forget when Thrall said “you ever seen a grown man naked?”
[0:57:59] plsnojebait: the altar is just mage groups now though so youll start getting less
[0:58:00] Nappycans: lol
[0:58:03] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut This is about alts, not even about mains, people want to play alts at endgame where mains are, not spend 100s of hours all over again
[0:58:04] bib0u_1: lol
[0:58:04] Deaddovedonoteat: good take
[0:58:05] colt420x: TRU
[0:58:07] dextuhx: @Xaryu you just all respawn on 5s dbm timer, get to alter and blast wave and arcane blast. thats the actual meta
[0:58:09] Horny_Captain_Falcon: tru
[0:58:10] graziNNN: Imagine being a warrior in this STV event
[0:58:11] damnitdann1: xardad have you pooped today
[0:58:11] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame like if you want all this, go play retail
[0:58:12] bloodsnaill: AB rep
[0:58:13] miciahclay: DBM pull timer to sync rez
[0:58:19] Seoken1: HC Classic 100% agreed, but this is SoD
[0:58:20] snoozzzzzzzzzz: levling sucks
[0:58:20] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut Well it is, stop living in 2004, we dont live in 2004
[0:58:20] thebus7: 1000000000%
[0:58:24] bellyguud: but the leveling experience is SM right now
[0:58:25] roxzssx: closer to retail tho
[0:58:26] thebus7: PREACH PREACH PREACH
[0:58:26] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:58:27] colt420x: I think its based on dicovery
[0:58:27] themarshalTV: 1000000000000000%
[0:58:27] snoozzzzzzzzzz: it s all about end game
[0:58:27] Degran: @Xaryu just turn it off at the inn?
[0:58:29] AdamAnt7: dude ...no one is lvling ..we all just spammm SM ..hello
[0:58:31] bib0u_1: so reduce xp from dungeons
[0:58:31] hulkdieselx: we dont all play this game 10 hours a day we work
[0:58:31] swoopydk: agreeeeeeeeeeeed
[0:58:32] Parametik: naw
[0:58:34] FIREMAGZZ: dude all those coins =4400 rep!
[0:58:34] bloodyjoker420: Going good bud how you doing today?and I agree with you
[0:58:35] Kuja_: Its not classic WoW its SoD, you gotta get that outta your head man
[0:58:35] Famewar: with a twist and the twist is faster leveling
[0:58:35] Celbee: Leveling is 0% of my classic
[0:58:36] Seoken1: Hardcore is about the journey, I agree with that 100%
[0:58:36] Zerksyera: Lame perspective, sorry
[0:58:37] yung_jed: if this was classic, yes. but its SoD, they made all these new runes and class identity for people to PLAY THEM not sit at level 15
[0:58:37] Bioaim7: agreed
[0:58:37] realxRusty: @AdamAnt7 nah
[0:58:37] Kersed805: thats all opinion. most of the time what I care about is end game pvp
[0:58:38] cutaway1: Classic wow = healthy food
[0:58:39] cxn_r: @Xaryu there is no longevity here, it's a 1 year seasonal server...
[0:58:39] TooByy_xX: disagree
[0:58:40] Darkdeaths: so lets sell lvl 60 boosts then!
[0:58:40] Parametik: sod is Wrath lite
[0:58:42] Clayray53: We gotta agree to disagree. not everybody is a full time streamer.
[0:58:42] thebus7: AMEN YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!!
[0:58:42] Coorsy: we all 40 already its for alts
[0:58:43] Joxtirol: poll it
[0:58:43] hearthledgerlol: Its not , Zoomers brains are fucking  cooked so they cant level slow or theyll explode
[0:58:43] shmanglez: but its only a season
[0:58:43] bobbiesmals: well clases keep getting nuked with nerfs
[0:58:44] auuzib: SoD = Classic era/retail QoL
[0:58:44] Mamba82: this is a seasonal server, there is no longevity to it
[0:58:46] Zuggith: what longevity? its seasonal
[0:58:46] TwistedFruit: rare xar l
[0:58:47] bloodsnaill: you aren’t speeding through because you have to stop at 40 and 50
[0:58:47] AdamAnt7: dude ...no one is lvling ..we all just spammm SM ..hello..
[0:58:48] cxn_r: @Xaryu there is no longevity here, it's a 1 year seasonal server..
[0:58:48] Zuggith: lmfao
[0:58:48] kodlaktv: considering i love classic and hate leveling i disagree
[0:58:48] DeathToad007: causals ruing classic just like og
[0:58:49] adam_brisbane: it is a month into phase 2 whent he buff comes out
[0:58:50] callmedcd1: @xaryu I’m getting into calisthenics and I see you on instagram doing some body weight workouts. any tips for a beginner?
[0:58:52] poorboy55: its a season server what longjevity
[0:58:52] thebus7: I only play 6 hours a week and I agree
[0:58:54] StinkyPig: there needs to be more interesting stuff to do in the leveling experience to keep it fresh
[0:58:55] snoozzzzzzzzzz: wow always been for end game content
[0:59:00] Zuggith: horrible take xaryu lol
[0:59:01] Eyedea808: isnt this beta for classic + though?
[0:59:03] iSPEN97: They where trolling
[0:59:03] Seoken1: Hardcore is about the journey, SoD is all about discovery and trying all the new stuff out
[0:59:04] Bioaim7: @adam_brisbane no it's 2 weeks
[0:59:08] Zerksyera: perspective from a streamer who wants more content
[0:59:08] FIREMAGZZ: I think your right for 80 percent of people
[0:59:08] OZZIDA: Kappa
[0:59:11] Vedros_: They said in their blue post in SoD they want to encourage alts, people want to play classes for the new runes, it’s all experimental.
[0:59:13] SlapdickWoWplayer: here's an idea. Just do what you want. level a bunch of alts? go for it. Main one char? go for it
[0:59:13] Nappycans: so its 9:15am now. What time we want to meet up?
[0:59:13] colt420x: SoD= Discover new things from classic you never seen before...not leveling
[0:59:15] astrix25: @xaryu the start of phase leveling is untouched and normal. the novelty wears off for alts
[0:59:16] myyrlidon: xar are you ignoring me or am i just unlucky
[0:59:19] batchestspam: @xaryu my alts are all 31 just from BRD runs, making it even easier is stupid
[0:59:20] Clayray53: @xaryu make a poll. For or against the XP boost
[0:59:20] jbeemerks: They said from the jump they want people to play the content in phases
[0:59:26] Big_Zum: leveling use to be the experience. it is for your first character at the launch of a server. after that it’s all about the end game
[0:59:27] AdamAnt7: im glad the whole chat gets it .....ty chat for being smart
[0:59:30] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame spamming dungeons should still be removed and they should buff questing XP... or open world mob farming. make the world feel alive.... not the entance to a dungeon
[0:59:31] realxRusty: @colt420x Discover it while leveling?
[0:59:34] shmanglez: Key word is SEASON
[0:59:36] cxn_r: @Xaryu there is no longevity here, it's a 1 year seasonal server...
[0:59:41] adam_brisbane: @Bioaim7 it came out on feb 8 the buff comes on march 5 that is 4 weeks
[0:59:41] meguidokun: lol not at all
[0:59:42] LaneWillingham: ive heard this take from multiple streamers so far, as a full time worker i dont mind the xp boost, but someone that doesnt have to work and can play all the time has their glory kinda robbed making end game accessible for everyone
[0:59:42] DeathToad007: its shit
[0:59:42] leiferikson4541: wait xp boost?
[0:59:43] ponaris: Yesterday xar
[0:59:43] Boruox: P O L L
[0:59:44] itsChubsyy: That would probably be correct
[0:59:46] AmazeJ: the other 20% just finished leveling
[0:59:46] ImClarity: 90%
[0:59:47] roxzssx: POLL
[0:59:48] bloodsnaill: people prolly burnt out on classic leveling after dying at 53 trying to kill obsidian in searing gorge @xaryu they need some speed leveling
[0:59:48] themarshalTV: poll itt
[0:59:49] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut Well its never going to be and should never be removed
[0:59:51] Dinomight3: it jsut opens the floodgates to other dumb stuff
[0:59:51] Clayray53: pollllll me bro
[0:59:52] Nappycans: @Xaryu so its 9:15am now. What time we want to meet up?
[0:59:52] jbeemerks: this is the way to keep people in the same content before end of phase.
[0:59:52] ImTsaky: @xaryu I like the idea of 20m MC cause that means half the time to acquire loot so maybe more content releases???
[0:59:52] iiTzCrayZ: you act like people really values the leveling experience when you instantly rushed through it first day 😭
[0:59:53] KingCiolan: the reality is we arent all teenagers with loads of free time any more, classic is only played by dads and boomers, you have to accept that the majority of people cant hardcore nerd wow classic anymore
[0:59:55] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[0:59:56] ShotFake: Sod doesn't = classic though
[1:00:00] cxn_r: @Xaryu there is no longevity here, it's a 1 year seasonal server.
[1:00:00] graziNNN: SoD is a test, so let them TEST things out
[1:00:01] beastnephew3: are you going to make an alt on SOD @xaryu
[1:00:05] SlapdickWoWplayer: give a dont care option
[1:00:06] DeathToad007: fucking zoomers
[1:00:06] Seoken1: Its ok to disagree chat, this is a good conversation to have
[1:00:08] ShotFake: Sod is about the new runes and new raids obv
[1:00:10] surgento: add a dont care option
[1:00:11] yung_jed: @iiTzCrayZ he didnt tho
[1:00:12] PunnyBeatsGames: any dont care option
[1:00:12] Kuja_: its not leveling boost
[1:00:13] bushthebug: what about bonus xp when you have majority talents in resto/holy spec classes
[1:00:16] Seoken1: dont care
[1:00:18] Seoken1: add the option
[1:00:21] auuzib: @Xaryu Longevity doesnt essentially matter on a Seasonal realm tho... does it?
[1:00:23] Talimill: 3rd option
[1:00:23] Goobadoobadoob: Most of the reason I don't like these changes is that they came late after I already leveled and bought mounts
[1:00:24] Talimill: not sure
[1:00:24] adam_brisbane: Cazn you make third option
[1:00:25] radassbadass69: I can COPIUM with the over boosted exp levels if things go back to normal when SEASON of discovery becomes ERA of discovery
[1:00:25] LJimbox: its nice so more people can enjoy the Raids while they are relevant.
[1:00:26] chillyt616: LET YOUR INER TROLL OUT XAR
[1:00:26] jbeemerks: argument farming
[1:00:27] mungas1: if you want to level in dungeons then do it. if you want to quest then do it
[1:00:28] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame like... ioncrease MOB XP by 100% or something.... but spamming a dungeon instide a instance shoulkd be a thing
[1:00:28] Bourdainism: should unlock once you get a level 40 for easier alts
[1:00:29] realxRusty: leveling boost saves you only a few hours anyway?
[1:00:32] bchamp93: good for the game but I'm pissed that I just hit 40 and got my mounts 2 days ago lol
[1:00:32] ShotFake: Sod isn't even scheduled to last forever
[1:00:33] PunnyBeatsGames: guess i wont vote if i dont care LUL
[1:00:33] limburgse: im not sure tho
[1:00:35] SlapdickWoWplayer: Dont care
[1:00:36] Snizzy9: should be increased exp on alts (after getting main to max)?
[1:00:36] leiferikson4541: wait we talking abt xp boost to 25?
[1:00:39] Craigumander: its hard bc everything is boring in wow. not immersive to quest at all so sadge
[1:00:41] Nellz3r: these poll results are sad
[1:00:44] ImTsaky: @xaryu I like the idea of 20m MC cause that means half the time to acquire loot so maybe more content releases???
[1:00:45] Gamalimbo: I saw it on reddit too @Xaryu
[1:00:46] erectiliann: @xaryu remember all those HC warriors you made lol
[1:00:46] Nellz3r: back to retail
[1:00:48] johnnyzampano: oneguyed
[1:00:48] beastnephew3: are you going to make an alt on SOD anytime soon like your SP in classic. @xaryu
[1:00:50] ralphh1541: sort by popular
[1:00:53] cxn_r: @Xaryu there is no longevity here, it's a 1 year seasonal server...
[1:00:55] myyrlidon: who re they tring to kill
[1:00:55] jakeo92: I can link, but gets deleted
[1:00:56] SoSoBurrito: scrubbed by devs TheIlluminati
[1:00:56] Xirtmcgirt: I'm more upset about the mount cost after buying two mounts!
[1:00:57] graziNNN: @Xaryu in chat
[1:00:57] brodiebrohan: @xaryu the thing is, I would say most of the “classic” players now are “wotlk players” so they like a fast paced game, ect. I bet if this season was out in 2019 people would hate these changes
[1:00:58] taylorsdank: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1b0p4rk/3_guilds_totaling_400500_participants_on_crusader/?share_id=xdZ5I7qEz4Hg5QQPWY1Kd&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=4
[1:00:58] itkbutt3rs: Guys, you can turn the buff on/off at an inn. You don't like it don't use it.
[1:00:59] Choopaloop: @Xaryu They attempted before the nerf to his dmg and healing
[1:00:59] tacodoc: More people doesn't make it easier
[1:00:59] iStrudderz: link in chat
[1:00:59] meguidokun: voted no and i have 2 40s, the grind was easy af lol
[1:01:00] Greynoise14: I linked
[1:01:04] Goobadoobadoob: @leiferikson4541 no the 100% xp boost from 1 to 39
[1:01:05] ColePowerz: wasnt that pree nerf
[1:01:06] astrix25: 69
[1:01:12] leiferikson4541: @Goobadoobadoob oh
[1:01:13] OZZIDA: pre nerf
[1:01:14] leiferikson4541: okay
[1:01:14] miciahclay: This was pre-nerf though
[1:01:15] damnitdann1: I saw the post too he turned into a giant
[1:01:15] Lethander54: yep
[1:01:15] taylorsdank: @jakeo92 thank you for link
[1:01:16] snoozzzzzzzzzz: no way
[1:01:18] DeathToad007: this is pre nerf
[1:01:18] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame they have already talked about possibly wanting to remove spamming of dungeons... people saiud the same thing about GDKP's being removed and look what they did
[1:01:18] Nize2: yea our server
[1:01:19] Lethander54: that's what I meant
[1:01:21] Dinomight3: look at all the photos
[1:01:22] jakeo92: Np
[1:01:28] Lethander54: look at his next
[1:01:28] remarkayble: GG
[1:01:29] OZZIDA: pre nerf 󠀀
[1:01:29] Lethander54: it's like a boot
[1:01:31] DeathToad007: this was before the nerf
[1:01:32] Ervill1: F
[1:01:32] synos___: check the last photo KEKL
[1:01:33] Lethander54: on screen
[1:01:34] Nappycans: man...
[1:01:34] itsagamerelax: ggs
[1:01:35] EbbandFlow_: They took his blood craze out
[1:01:35] limburgse: LUL
[1:01:36] Spijker84: look at all the photos
[1:01:37] Choopaloop: they nerfed that scaling
[1:01:37] davesodave: F
[1:01:41] OZZIDA: this is pre nerf
[1:01:42] adam_brisbane: they did not opt out
[1:01:42] DeathToad007: blood craze got nerfed
[1:01:43] Smoothieluv: LOLOL
[1:01:44] tacodoc: If he heals every 10 secs you probably need to max range it
[1:01:45] Kuja_: this was pre nerf
[1:01:45] DeathToad007: show the boot pic
[1:01:45] iiTzCrayZ: all the ppl who bought mounts already 😭😭
[1:01:45] limburgse: you need 1500 peepsLUL
[1:01:48] Gamalimbo: There are more pictures @Xaryu
[1:01:49] DeathToad007: scroll the pics
[1:01:49] sickal: look at other pics
[1:01:49] miciahclay: look at the other photos!
[1:01:50] hylzan: You will be fine
[1:01:50] synos___: check the other photos
[1:01:51] killawatts75: I told you
[1:01:51] Seoken1: @Xaryu BRING THE WHOLE SERVER LUL
[1:01:51] adam_brisbane: it shows hte player did not opt out
[1:01:52] Ophelly: they don'T have the zandalar emissare buff to hop out of the event
[1:01:52] funcky1969: Hey :) !
[1:01:54] sdotpuff: more pics
[1:01:54] Stinzo92: looks like all 3170 of you are going to be called into work today, xar needs you
[1:01:54] itsagamerelax: not sure if its doable sub 1000
[1:01:56] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut They have not talked about that, you are now just factually lieing, they want to make people quest more  but not remove how people want to lvl up, so thats why they added 1-39 gold boost
[1:01:56] DeathToad007: look at the othe rpics
[1:01:57] StinkyPig: @Xaryu Slower leveling experience works better with 1 dungeon lockout per day.
[1:01:58] ImTsaky: xaryu I like the idea of 20m MC cause that means half the time to acquire loot so maybe more content releases???
[1:01:59] ColePowerz: what if he drops a corrupted ashbringer
[1:02:04] synos___: he is huge
[1:02:04] Sourslays: I think you need both factions to kill this
[1:02:05] Ophelly: they are only in groups of 5
[1:02:07] Seoken1: Ya'll need to bring the entire server out
[1:02:07] Nappycans: thats a big boot
[1:02:07] erousagi: feet
[1:02:09] hulkdieselx: confirmed 68% of your viewers are gainfully employed
[1:02:10] myyrlidon: where they in multiple raids
[1:02:13] adam_brisbane: they did not opt out of the vent ?
[1:02:15] Gashunk1: ERA+ when? OpieOP
[1:02:16] jakeo92: This was prenerf attempt, we tried again yesterday with 114 guildies. He's tankable now, but too much healing
[1:02:17] Nekator: what does he drop?
[1:02:17] limburgse: oh he grows?
[1:02:22] Fai_z: @hulkdieselx bruh
[1:02:26] davesodave: try it
[1:02:28] sullyman13: you know he's going to drop 4 silver and 2 silk cloth
[1:02:29] LJimbox: literally can disable the exp boost
[1:02:30] littlehak: @xaryu I understand and respect your argument, I actually agree with you they should leave classic leveling xp alone.  but I like to be open minded and my thought process is that there is a ton of people that have gone through the classic leveling process and may be burned from it so the dev team may be thinking that and just make things easier.  idk
[1:02:31] ponaris: Maybe you need less ppl to not get his dmg buff?
[1:02:33] Floresking: Floresking subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:02:37] Parametik: they heard your take right befor eit ofc itd be different
[1:02:38] Kuja_: if you dont like it, disable it
[1:02:39] lHlUlLlK: i didn't see the poll woulda voted YES
[1:02:43] Eon_Ltd: i think most people dont care about the xp boost since they play 1 character
[1:02:46] Phoenix3215: You're not gonna get 500 people in the middle of a weekday
[1:02:47] Joxtirol: he grows when he get kills not over dmg
[1:02:47] Seoken1: Nah your opinion is still valid, but its an opinion
[1:02:48] NelsonGamingShow: HUH
[1:02:50] radassbadass69: nah the people are regarded
[1:02:51] qchdesauvage: @littlehak u wont to lvl - go era lol or hc
[1:02:53] tacodoc: Leveling isn't hard. Did it need a boost when there's already nothing to do for weeks on end?
[1:02:57] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[1:03:01] rikki1105: @Xaryu  do you think its bad that they reduce the cost of maount by 50%??
[1:03:03] AdamAnt7: lol the streamers takes effects the poll in his channel
[1:03:03] Parametik: its like politics ye
[1:03:03] stroobzbeats: democracy!
[1:03:07] bellyguud: @Xaryu aggrend said xp buff can be disabled "This can actually be disabled at any innkeeper. So if he wants to go it old school, he totally can."
[1:03:08] LaneWillingham: your opinion makes sense in your situation though
[1:03:10] Gashunk1: they should focus more on expanding the world, if they continue after naxx
[1:03:11] stroobzbeats: popular vote!
[1:03:13] Smoothieluv: Thiing is.. humans are more invested into what they put more time into
[1:03:14] Bioaim7: @Kuja_ you dont understand a thing if you say that
[1:03:17] Reinert7284: If its really that bad you can turn it off
[1:03:17] FamSisher: thats the classicwow subreddit
[1:03:20] damnitdann1: I mean I think being a full time player of the game as a job puts you in the minority, so it makes sense if you share a minority opinion
[1:03:20] Reinert7284: its a win win
[1:03:24] ShotFake: @xaryu sod isn't about the leveling experience though
[1:03:26] labraxI: yolo
[1:03:28] d4ngling: alt+f4
[1:03:33] jbeemerks: but don’t change your opinion
[1:03:33] BullzeyeWoW: Xp boost should only be for alts once you have a lvl 40
[1:03:33] CritsAndTaxes: No one asked for it - but they're throwing it out there so thats fine haha. There are so many ways to play WoW, and even many ways to play classic. Nothing lost, seasonal / limited time mode as well
[1:03:34] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[1:03:35] hubbardhs: hubbardhs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:03:40] streyeker: @Xaryu  are you going to be playing ssf?
[1:03:40] heyitsken_: @xaryu outside the WoW hype/talks any chance at doing another run on elden ring before dlc comes out to get warmed up?
[1:03:41] blackcukoo: I only have time to play a certain amount of time, if i meet a guy with 5 times the amount of playtime on his 4 alt, we are equal:P
[1:03:42] Nekator: what does that big troll drop?
[1:03:45] jakeo92: Prob was since I sent ya a mobile lin
[1:03:46] StinkyPig: @Xaryu How do you feel about implementing hc dungeon lockout rules for sod. This would avoid dungeon spam. A better experience for slow leveling
[1:03:48] rikki1105: @Xaryu  do you think its bad that they reduce the cost of maount by 50%??
[1:03:56] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[1:03:56] JNOFI: there are three reddit designs, they are beta-testing the newest one for select users
[1:04:00] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame they specifically said they dont like dungeon spamming. having a large open world and it feeling empty for the first 10 days because everyone is standing outside of a dungeon going into a instance is dumb
[1:04:01] Kickaris: Kickaris subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! ayooooo
[1:04:05] penteekk: xp buff helps me finding people for sm. it is dead atm on my server
[1:04:08] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[1:04:09] iStrudderz: Too many people got banned for gold buying, xp boost comes out at perfect time for them lol
[1:04:11] Stinzo92: i mean they clearly stated at the start that just because 60 is the cap doesnt mean its classic.
[1:04:13] Raym9nd: anything that decreases time spent leveling is good in my opinion, done it too many times
[1:04:15] graziNNN: Yes, SoD is a test, let people test things out
[1:04:15] Stinzo92: At all
[1:04:26] AppleJaxZzz: i mean u talk about a twist...level boost is a twist. its SoD just testing new things. Characters will probs be moved later
[1:04:31] AdamAnt7: LUL this guy ...is a ryda
[1:04:32] Pixelate93: true
[1:04:32] Shiggitty: they need to turn wow into a mario maker type deal so the community can just do what they want
[1:04:32] fitethepower: SOD isnt Classic
[1:04:34] Smoothiez_: and what is wrong with that
[1:04:35] ImClarity: Go play Era if you want to slowly level to 60
[1:04:36] potatoezrgud: SoD is a test realm
[1:04:36] AmazeJ: season of discovery is a test? no way!
[1:04:38] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut They specifically never said they hate dungeon spammers, they aint gonna remove it that, it will destroy the playerbase
[1:04:40] Smoothiez_: a lot of people are fine with that
[1:04:40] Pixelate93: yes
[1:04:41] Gamalimbo: Aggrend did say they are looking into SoD being end-game focused
[1:04:42] Reaperz_kinetic: @thebus7 this LITERALLY isn’t classic dude…. this IS a beta test 😂
[1:04:46] Pixelate93: exactly
[1:04:46] bellyguud: @Xaryu aggrend said xp buff can be disabled "This can actually be disabled at any innkeeper. So if he wants to go it old school, he totally can."  It's flexible IMO, you can level slow if you want
[1:04:50] AdamAnt7: noo its so we can have fun long term
[1:04:51] Quanum_Physics: TwitchConHYPE
[1:04:51] Gashunk1: everyone should have their true opinions tho
[1:04:53] lHlUlLlK: go play era
[1:04:54] ConceptualDesigns: its seasonal, test dat shit
[1:04:56] Stinzo92: They have Classic Era if you want classic so badly. Stop with this talking point its moot
[1:04:56] Shiggitty: custom servers will be a thing soon i hope
[1:04:57] DeathToad007: indeed
[1:05:00] miciahclay: I agree, these changes feel like beta testing for something later. They want to get more testing on all the classes
[1:05:02] Kuja_: classic+ wont have the exp boost probably
[1:05:03] Habaden: Seasonal, might not even be here next year
[1:05:04] PMA_1: this is wow2 beta
[1:05:04] AdamAnt7: ugh i gtg
[1:05:05] Kuja_: this isnt classic+
[1:05:06] erectiliann: The XP is great for most players, the slower ones to finish up and others start farming up alts
[1:05:06] fitethepower: ResidentSleeper
[1:05:06] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame your argument is the same thing people were syaing about removing GDKP's lol
[1:05:07] Snorlax_King: they need to nerf dungeon boosting
[1:05:07] g0dzilla: sod is beta testing... nothing else... fuck the retail/classic discussion
[1:05:09] avo_9: You have to remember this is a seasonal mode and people want to play the new specs. Because the mode is temporary, people should have faster elveling IMO
[1:05:10] bib0u_1: dungeon spam to 60 has less integrity
[1:05:10] Pixiepantss: i agree 100%
[1:05:12] DeathToad007: @lHlUlLlK nuanced take my man
[1:05:12] graziNNN: They can remove the XP in the actual game tho, this is a beta
[1:05:12] Kosmicpanther: I think the SEASONAL part keeps getting left out
[1:05:15] jbeemerks: yeah so more people playing all the classes is good
[1:05:15] Pixelate93: all games come to an end
[1:05:16] labraxI: when is SF ?
[1:05:16] lilecho93: Yea but if your community is leaving they had to change something if its taking to long to reach the "fun" part
[1:05:18] Quanum_Physics: classic plus you say?
[1:05:19] unclegez: They want as much info as they can get for classic plus, they will not put xp boost into an actual classic plus
[1:05:19] Celbee: 1000% xp boost on Classic+ would be better
[1:05:20] blazzedzz: It's a seasonal server tho
[1:05:21] zebercetanayurt: then you are contradicting yourself because if we are testing classic plus then it is better to level faster and test classes WTH
[1:05:22] matheusin_42: woah guys the game where it's completely different than the other game is not the same omg
[1:05:23] TerrortheToast: but this is not classic+, this is SoD :D
[1:05:24] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut Like I said, your talking in a vast minority of saying "remove dungeon spamming" good luck man
[1:05:26] NelsonGamingShow: you got make the game accessible XAAR
[1:05:27] kudas__: @Xaryu I feel like this goes down the road of low hanging fruit. Its on par with the way society is today. Instnat gratification over earned gratification.
[1:05:27] UltrawideGameGuy: Seasonal isn't long term
[1:05:28] cianfromuruguay: let noobs lvl alters so we have something to kill at hillsbrad
[1:05:29] Seoken1: Fair, I think they maybe should remove it for SoD Relaunch after it completes  it's current iteration
[1:05:34] jbeemerks: more people playing phase content at same time
[1:05:35] penteekk: so classic should stay a game for homeoffice people?
[1:05:35] matheusin_42: ofc SoD isnt classic, it's not supposed to be
[1:05:35] Pixelate93: all games come to an end and sod is seasonal
[1:05:35] Kuja_: Classic+ will be a completely different thing xaryu
[1:05:36] miciahclay: I don't anyone thinks classic + will have the boost, this boost is to get more testing in during SoD
[1:05:37] Pixiepantss: yessss
[1:05:39] Shiggitty: they split the game up into 3 diff parts and all have the same sub, thats a bad business model LUL
[1:05:39] Hirshberg: bro its a seasonal game mode chill this isn't classic+
[1:05:40] Dinomight3: you think you do but you don't
[1:05:40] potatoezrgud: 100% agree with you if this was actually classic plus
[1:05:41] CritsAndTaxes: hi yutoob
[1:05:41] Moerdarlaxen: agree
[1:05:42] damnitdann1: play the damn game or don’t, instead of arguing about it…that’s how I feel
[1:05:42] Pixiepantss: yesssssssssssss
[1:05:43] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame people said removing GDKP;s would kill the game... and now youre saying that removing dungeon spamming would destroy the game
[1:05:44] Alfacor: No matter what side of the line you are on with this... I think testing things is important.  We won't know how the community takes it at large until it is tried.
[1:05:44] eyonixz: they said it was for p3 and they're just bringing it forward though @Xaryu
[1:05:45] Pixiepantss: yessssssssssss
[1:05:45] xDrChoppy: SoD isnt classic WoW. Its modded WoW PTR.  @Xaryu
[1:05:45] labraxI: When is SF guys ??
[1:05:45] potatoezrgud: yes
[1:05:46] FlyingKangaroo_: yes
[1:05:46] Seoken1: So SoD 2.0 should NOT have bonus xp, I agree with that
[1:05:46] Kuja_: disagree
[1:05:46] DeathToad007: 1000% agree
[1:05:47] bellyguud: I don't get the controversy, just disable it if you don't want to level faster
[1:05:47] fitethepower: No
[1:05:47] thebus7: Amen for the longterm this is not what Classic + is, this is for beta testing! They just made that statement!! Preach Xar, honored to have you comment on this!
[1:05:47] alrik_plays: this isnt Classic+
[1:05:48] NelsonGamingShow: no
[1:05:48] greinerr: no
[1:05:48] bib0u_1: sure
[1:05:48] letsgoforsen123: no
[1:05:48] bchamp93: just go run SM 100+ times like the rest of us
[1:05:48] BigbadKevin: wouldnt more people at max level be better than less people?
[1:05:49] Pixiepantss: yes yes yes
[1:05:50] Stinzo92: Well classic+ wouldnt be a seasonal thing.. so its different
[1:05:50] JNOFI: No, disagree
[1:05:50] Parametik: no
[1:05:50] IanEdgerton: yes
[1:05:51] TooByy_xX: no
[1:05:51] picanhatv: nop
[1:05:51] Jazzarus_: no
[1:05:51] ninetysix: @Xaryu what do you think about players checking logs on level up raids
[1:05:51] iLtDan: yes
[1:05:51] Reaperz_kinetic: no lol
[1:05:52] Zerksyera: no aggree
[1:05:52] Quanum_Physics: when is the Hardcore self found starting?
[1:05:52] dianewiththehip: Yes
[1:05:52] Hirshberg: no
[1:05:52] adam_brisbane: when peopl are raid logging isnt it better to have more characters so they cna raid more?
[1:05:53] jbarish: AGREE
[1:05:53] Zanrill: no its too grindy
[1:05:53] ripprrooster: Yes
[1:05:53] Heartofc: @matheusin_42 why is it called classic then einstein?
[1:05:53] AppleJaxZzz: i mean i agree its just test
[1:05:53] FrostsWorld: No experience boost in a 3 month phase for people who work would be insane
[1:05:54] BergEsquire: BergEsquire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[1:05:54] ConceptualDesigns: its also a bait to get more players on
[1:05:55] l337I: there should be NO BOOSTS for first characters AT ALL TIMES. I can see it being good for Alts but that's it.
[1:05:55] LeggomyEggoNow: long term I agree for a seasonal server it’s ok
[1:05:55] smander: its healtthy because they are allowing people to flip "mains" constantly if the tuning. runes etc dont line up with how they wanted to play the game
[1:05:56] probeu: Classic+ is screwed if sod is the foundation lol.
[1:05:56] ColePowerz: i really dont think it matters that much
[1:05:57] Kosmicpanther: there’s no long term
[1:05:58] RedChaosTV: this isnt classic + its a "Season" of discovery , a seasonal game mode for classic wow
[1:05:58] SuaSponte: SoD is the beta test for classic plus, an xp boost is fine haha
[1:05:59] zebercetanayurt: no, then you are contradicting yourself because if we are testing classic plus then it is better to level faster and test classes WTH
[1:06:00] Snizzy9: alts could get exp boosts after having main at max imo. some ppl want multiple classes to keep things fresh
[1:06:01] chrislu18: 40 - 60 plzzz no boosts. 1-40 is kinda ehh but whatever
[1:06:01] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut You mean the  gold buyers and gold sellers saying that and creating doom? What you on about?
[1:06:01] DeathToad007: tik tok brain zoomers
[1:06:01] ShotFake: This isn't classic + tho
[1:06:02] Kuja_: This isnt classic+ though xaryu, this is SoD
[1:06:02] ImClarity: its just player pref at this point
[1:06:02] killawatts75: *throws tomato
[1:06:02] iLtDan: i dont think they will give xp boosts in actual classic+
[1:06:04] Spijker84: We cant really see the numbers, at some point, if there aren't enough people at max level to adequately test all the new balances and changes, there needs to be a boost
[1:06:04] NightMunchies: sup Xar
[1:06:05] ripprrooster: If it's dead now there is no future
[1:06:05] FoleyGrail: yes especially when the phase will last 3 months
[1:06:05] Kosmicpanther: it’s a season lol
[1:06:05] bib0u_1: its way to grindy but yea
[1:06:05] aackee: classic+ would literally all be endgame focused ??
[1:06:06] roxzssx: sod is not classic +
[1:06:08] Ama_ryilis: i don't want the boost. i like leveling slow
[1:06:08] kudas__: Yes 100 % W....... I feel like this goes down the road of low hanging fruit. Its on par with the way society is today. Instnat gratification over earned gratification.
[1:06:10] Quaztopher: brother I work 80 hours a week. nah
[1:06:10] Reinert7284: @Xaryu is it that big of a problem if you can turn if it off, for those that dont want it.
[1:06:11] penteekk: for streamers it doesnt matter. nromal peope will just play another game
[1:06:12] lilecho93: i think youre right. i think people need something to reach the fun portion of sod but also people will quit sooner from it
[1:06:14] ripwarlock2: Just wait till we get Transmog in P4
[1:06:15] Stinzo92: SOD is seasonal, an exp boost doesnt matter and one could argue its needed
[1:06:16] damnitdann1: 1 in the chat if you’ve pooped today
[1:06:16] trainindummy: The point of classic the journey to max level not the end game. Theyre taking a more retail based mindset on classic
[1:06:18] letsgoforsen123: People get tired about leveling in the same zones over and over again. It's just that simple.
[1:06:20] BigbadKevin: wouldnt more people at max level be better than less people?  󠀀
[1:06:21] stroobzbeats: I thought SoD was classic plus ?
[1:06:21] NightMunchies: how u doing bud?
[1:06:22] Nellz3r: lol this is absolutely classic+
[1:06:22] ImClarity: people have played priv servers with xp increase for years some people just want to level faster
[1:06:23] graziNNN: 2
[1:06:24] yung_jed: we live in the now xar
[1:06:25] ConceptualDesigns: pre-classic+
[1:06:27] Kuja_: For classic+ yes there shouldnt be an exp boost
[1:06:28] Goobadoobadoob: Sod is classic plus alpha
[1:06:28] iiTzCrayZ: as a new person that leveled without the cap buff at all I don’t think it’s even that hard
[1:06:30] kirk_hunts: Are you sure that we can attack the blood good when we're opted out of the event? Wouldn't that opt us out of fighting the boss?
[1:06:32] ironbull007: this is a season
[1:06:32] Parametik: idk if its semantics rather than just a different game different experience
[1:06:33] johnnyzampano: no
[1:06:33] adam_brisbane: they did not opt out
[1:06:34] miciahclay: 3 days ago
[1:06:34] namesbuck: no
[1:06:35] fitethepower: Not a chance
[1:06:35] davesodave: yes
[1:06:36] BreezeEUW: Actually havnt found leveling so soul draining. Think that cutting it up into phases has made it way more enjoyable leveling, have tried leveling classic a few times but it felt daunting.
[1:06:36] DaProfit: that as pre nerf
[1:06:36] Tovone: sod is a sandbox for classic +
[1:06:37] erectiliann: Whenever you reach max level that’s when you realize the journey was the best part
[1:06:37] Reaperz_kinetic: sod is a beta for the possibility of a future classic + …. plenty of betas have level boosts so that people can test things and try out everything.
[1:06:38] OZZIDA: EZ
[1:06:38] DeathToad007: es thi sis pre nerf
[1:06:38] Ddocz: BRING 6 GUILDS
[1:06:38] astrix25: new take: let boomies shine in pve
[1:06:39] eskilda: no
[1:06:39] Choopaloop: Yes because it got nerfed
[1:06:39] leiferikson4541: thats pre nerf
[1:06:41] probeu: No
[1:06:41] richdawg: no way no how do you kill
[1:06:43] blazzedzz: Is classic pluse beta lol
[1:06:45] ColePowerz: need to call in the reinforcements
[1:06:45] damnitdann1: 1
[1:06:46] DeathToad007: fuck off zoomers
[1:06:47] aoe_enjoyer: classic retail -
[1:06:47] crazykman290: more than likely no, but you should still try
[1:06:49] aackee: if you want nice leveling you should ask for fresh new server s
[1:06:50] Smoothieluv: ROI
[1:06:51] letsgoforsen123: ????
[1:06:51] Quaztopher: your perspective is skewed because you play 40+ hours a week. most people work and can’t play wow as much as you
[1:06:52] jbeemerks: yes you will kill it
[1:06:53] Pixiepantss: 100%
[1:06:56] smander: SoD - Season of dicovery. encourages people to play and Discover multiple different characters they may would never have tried otherwise
[1:06:57] NightMunchies: i agree
[1:06:58] limburgse: 100%
[1:06:58] jamerk_: 400 rookies, you will have 200 twitch chat pros
[1:06:59] Stinzo92: if the characters are only going to be around for a year or so, an exp boost doesnt hurt anyone.
[1:07:00] AppleJaxZzz: agreed
[1:07:01] letsgoforsen123: Who cares, I had fun
[1:07:02] Pixelate93: all games come to an end
[1:07:03] DeathToad007: we saw this happen with vanilla already
[1:07:04] AceOfFlame: @liightzouut im done with this convo, your trying to create strawmans trying to have different arguement, lvling up is not gdkps, im done
[1:07:06] samuxtv: @Xaryu It's a seasonal event, if we were talking about classic + everyone would be agreeing with you
[1:07:07] Habaden: game will be dead in a year anyways because its seasonal
[1:07:09] AppleJaxZzz: u had fun..
[1:07:10] gamesbycorporate: agreed -- which is why it's okay for a seasonal server
[1:07:10] Pixiepantss: bliz seems to not think about long term
[1:07:11] Big_Zum: yeah classic plus shouldn’t have xp buff lmao I thought we were talking about the 1 year server SoD
[1:07:11] LaneWillingham: you gotta think about it like a business brother. if most of your paying players are working full time, then slowing the level caters to a small percentage of grinders
[1:07:11] Parametik: more players? more alts? more raids? more pvp???
[1:07:12] jbeemerks: but it’s phased content
[1:07:12] ninetysix: xaryu get sardaco to lead this boss kill
[1:07:12] yung_jed: if it dies it dies. whats good for the game now is more pepole to log on and level alts
[1:07:13] Famewar: but this is seasonal cuh
[1:07:14] Kuja_: yes but SoD is not a long term thing, it a seasonal thing
[1:07:15] richdawg: exactly right xaryu
[1:07:17] Rindu: real and true
[1:07:18] dextuhx: brother its seasonal
[1:07:18] RaptorJack1: They did the 100% buff for alts, they want us playing alts in SOD
[1:07:18] FrostsWorld: I mean we're only talking 3-4 month phases... We need short term @Xaryu
[1:07:18] saveslol: but this is a seasonal thing, literally not meant for long term
[1:07:20] samuxtv: Sod isnt long term bro
[1:07:20] adam_brisbane: @xaryu if you look at the screenshot there is no debuff for opting out of event
[1:07:20] rpl_1337: But these are seasonal servers. This version is going to die anyhow
[1:07:20] Pixiepantss: 100% 100%
[1:07:21] Zerksyera: maybe it shouldnt be longterm lol
[1:07:22] jakeo92: Whatever you do, don't try and kite STV boss out of STV. He teleports back to spawn, we tried going into dusk wood
[1:07:22] Ryso33: doin great work man
[1:07:22] DeathToad007: based xar
[1:07:23] NightMunchies: all games will come to the end in time
[1:07:23] Vedros_: this is a seasonal server
[1:07:24] lHlUlLlK: no one wants to spend hundreds of hours leveling
[1:07:24] king_king10: just look at retail over all these years with smalll steps of just making it easier
[1:07:24] themarshalTV: couldnt agree more
[1:07:24] CruchTV: sod has no content long term u need cool grindable shit that makes your account special not some dumb purple thats gonna be irrelevant in 3 months
[1:07:25] Hellacat: cool opinion im gonna level some alts bro
[1:07:26] Joxtirol: Instead of lvling boost they should make new quests hubs @Xaryu
[1:07:27] Nize2: to be fair this game is gonna b pretty short
[1:07:27] aoonkk: they need 2 help people with jobs
[1:07:28] Zanrill: its a season tho
[1:07:29] fitethepower: its literally a seasonal game
[1:07:29] M1ntss: true
[1:07:29] InfernalMike: Bro there is no long term, this is a seasonal server
[1:07:29] Celbee: Longterm - remove leveling
[1:07:30] jbeemerks: there is new end game every 3 months
[1:07:32] BreezeEUW: Wow 2 release soon
[1:07:32] damnitdann1: sod is not long term
[1:07:32] SuaSponte: i dont think SoD is a long term thing though
[1:07:33] bushthebug: was seasonal ever supposed to last?
[1:07:34] fitethepower: Seasons change
[1:07:34] Philosofiser: you can’t exist in the long term if you don’t make it through the short term
[1:07:35] thebus7: Keep voicing this opinion Xar!!!!!
[1:07:36] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[1:07:36] Pixiepantss: yes
[1:07:36] lHlUlLlK: WHO TF IS PLAYING THIS GAME TO LEVEL?
[1:07:37] itsChubsyy: It won't be here 2 years from now
[1:07:38] greinerr: season of discovery wont exist 2 years from now
[1:07:39] knifeparty818: @xaryu Do you feel its bad timing for the XP boost and SF  release?
[1:07:39] Zanrill: its a season, its not supposed to last
[1:07:40] labraxI: When is SF guys ??
[1:07:41] PhinmaN: It's a temp game mode anyway
[1:07:41] Perdonamo: that post is pre-nerf
[1:07:41] bojack359: They have retail for fast get everything now
[1:07:42] chrislu18: What if they have big plans for end game and want as many people to experience that? maybe we just have to wait it out and see how it works out
[1:07:42] unclegez: Sod will not be around for years
[1:07:43] Kosmicpanther: I don’t think sod will be here next year
[1:07:43] kirk_hunts: @Xaryu real question, have we figured out if we can fight the boss while opted out of the event?
[1:07:44] ShotFake: Cuh I'm not playing sod for 20 years
[1:07:44] strangepleb: Xar is not talking about classic but about life in general, DAMN!
[1:07:45] Astralthundr: Welcome to the TikTok generation. People don't have the attention span or foresight to see the long term.
[1:07:46] bendelat: @Xaryu when people did the same quest for 20 times I don't think leveling experience has any appeal left
[1:07:47] InfernalMike: SoD is never meant to be long term
[1:07:47] cxn_r: this is a 1 year server bro lol
[1:07:47] matheusin_42: Wow players are so entitled it's crazy
[1:07:47] NightMunchies: some go on for 30+ years so only 6months
[1:07:48] Stinzo92: 2 years from now SOD wont be around my friend, its a SEASONAL server/game mode
[1:07:48] Parametik: @lHlUlLlK thank you
[1:07:49] jbeemerks: seasonal is short term by nature
[1:07:49] Mamba82: you need to succeed some in the short term though to get to the longevity point too
[1:07:49] BigbadKevin: wouldn't more people at max level be better is that not the goal here with the xp boost? @Xaryu
[1:07:50] snoozzzzzzzzzz: well u should start formin now if u need 500 lool
[1:07:50] miciahclay: Xp boost = more testing for SoD for a NEW RELEASE of something like Classic _
[1:07:51] parmejohn__: i think the season will end and our characters will be moved to classic +.
[1:07:52] aoonkk: wow is a long term investment type of game
[1:07:53] gamedaystar: Xp boost would make more sense if max lvl was 60 already
[1:07:54] Pixelate93: i'd quit if they didnt do the change
[1:07:56] Gashunk1: I want SSF SC
[1:07:56] raki379: You say "now" because you are saying people will get bored in end game content, but Blizzard is making their decisions off of their data which may suggest that they believe more people are quitting before getting to end game content
[1:07:57] Goobadoobadoob: Just because it's seasonal doesn't mean it's just going to go away where tf you think era went
[1:07:59] damnitdann1: Xar stop dodging my question have you pooped today or not?!?
[1:08:00] bellyguud: @Xaryu do you have a group playing SF?
[1:08:01] lonesovl: maybe give xp boost to characters after one hits lvl cap, increasing with more characters at the cap. Leveling hunter/mage alts for farming mats and consumes and gold is quite tiring when you already have 1 or 2 mains @Xaryu
[1:08:02] g0dzilla: @Habaden yes and thats good and intentional... because its a SEASON... what comes after the season is the importnat thing and needs be be looked at as the longevity
[1:08:02] mellven: @Xaryu im the only person in my guild that wasnt a fan of the xp and gold reward buffs
[1:08:03] Dragunstorm15: but how does an xp boost now affect season 3
[1:08:03] Reaperz_kinetic: you’re not thinking about this in the long term though… because this is a beta version of the game that will eventually lead to classic + the more people that can play the game and experience EVERYTHING at every level the better for the testing
[1:08:04] ibetrippiin: what is sf?
[1:08:04] Vedros_: it’s a seasonal server. they’re experimenting with classes and runes and they want people to play them. this isn’t a long lasting classic server
[1:08:04] meguidokun: scottye made a video on this, theres like 180k people raiding, back at bfd there was almost 500k even more, they do want us to play alts
[1:08:05] probeu: I had more fun leveling than anything I've done at 40 tbh
[1:08:06] yayo33street: When is SSF?
[1:08:07] Coalmanite_: I think the level boost should only come if you already leveled a level 40
[1:08:08] Philosofiser: you have to capture attention and maximize ROI while it lasts.
[1:08:09] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[1:08:11] Pixiepantss: what was the q lol
[1:08:15] peter_pipe_her_: confirmed (what am i confirming?)
[1:08:15] jakeo92: You can, that's what wood department did
[1:08:16] ImTsaky: do players really want a 2-3 year version tho?
[1:08:16] labraxI: When is SF guys ??
[1:08:17] Docoda: What if the exp buff was only available for alts after you leveled one character the classic way and did some pre-requirement?
[1:08:17] StoneyySage: Whats going on here.... thats not the right shirt. I dont like change Xar
[1:08:20] RS_Reaver: @mellven I like the xp but NOT the gold buffs
[1:08:21] inhaledthc: :D
[1:08:23] hearthledgerlol: They need actual content aside from runes / changed dungeons. Quest line intergration, special large scale events, unlock zones that are still lock in orignial continents, etc. They gotta do the OSRS 2007 route where they add in genuine new content and potentially have players vote on it.
[1:08:24] KosmicDevil_: didn’t they split sod into phases for longevity but they’re increasing the xp so u hit endgame and get stuck raid logging sooner
[1:08:25] killawill707: people want to play end game content . phases only last for limited amounts of time . a lot of SOD players are casual . it feels bad if they only get a short period of time to experience that content
[1:08:25] Nellz3r: my god stop talking about it being seasonal lol, it's the building blocks for classic+ and theyve stated it.  what happens now is what the future classic + is going to be
[1:08:26] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame i was just saying that youre literally having the same argument people had for removing GDKP's... if you think the mast majority of this game would quit because they couldnt spam dungeons then your living in a make believe world. This is the best version of WOW =they have made in years.
[1:08:27] NightMunchies: 2-3 version no
[1:08:29] letsgoforsen123: They should have instant max level boost if you have one max level character
[1:08:30] FrostsWorld: That dude needs to find a new guild
[1:08:31] blazzedzz: Is SOD gonna last 3 years??
[1:08:31] kirk_hunts: to me it wouldn't make sense that we can kill a boss tied to the event that we opt out of
[1:08:34] Hellacat: thankfully there are game modes without those buffs
[1:08:35] FIREMAGZZ: does this mean p3 is coming out end of March?
[1:08:36] Mikeymoney1: when is the xp boost active? @Xaryu
[1:08:37] NightMunchies: that be boring
[1:08:38] Niffah: I havent asked actually but how is life with a toupe going? Looks good atleast @Xaryu
[1:08:40] myyrlidon: @Xaryu what do you think about the new mount price changes. i looked at them and thought give me my gold back.
[1:08:50] adam_brisbane: yes you can
[1:08:50] Kazay1998: You can
[1:08:51] jakeo92: Can confirmed
[1:08:52] Gamalimbo: Why do you think there will be a mount drop from boss? What information made you think that? @Xaryu
[1:08:54] Str4nge_DejaVu: How long until they start buffing WSG rep
[1:08:54] limburgse: ye, you can see the boss when opted out
[1:08:55] greinerr: the boss can sstill kill you if youve opt'd out
[1:09:00] limburgse: dont know about targeting him
[1:09:00] lichskunk74: I'm calling bullshit
[1:09:03] nykkjen1: Where can I read about this XP boost? just heard about it
[1:09:05] ZephForShort: mount price changes?
[1:09:06] Pixiepantss: 100%
[1:09:08] ipntheshower: I think the gold reward buff is great, it'll give people more reason to get out into the world and do quests and not sit at SM for 3 days straight getting to 40
[1:09:08] Pixiepantss: 200%
[1:09:10] fitethepower: KEKW
[1:09:10] bchamp93: yeah that was dumb
[1:09:12] alexgoat94: why??
[1:09:13] thebus7: PREACH
[1:09:13] Pixiepantss: yes
[1:09:14] leiferikson4541: wait what did mount prices change to?
[1:09:15] bchamp93: getting gold is so easy
[1:09:15] Zugah17: @nykkjen1 wowhead
[1:09:15] LJimbox: they should remove runes
[1:09:15] raivven933: what does it cost ow
[1:09:16] Hirshberg: if you want a boring long ass grind go play classic era servers
[1:09:16] werner__ziegler: you can see it
[1:09:17] renswat: i bought my mount yesterday!
[1:09:20] liightzouut: @AceOfFlame these are the same people wanting to level MORE alts in a 20 year alt version of the game lol
[1:09:21] miciahclay: @killawill707 right, and bonus xp (for blizzard) is more testing with more people playing each class. I don't want xp boost and not playing many alts (2 already 40), but I can see how it helps Blizzard to do more testing
[1:09:21] Ervill1: yeah but still expecting a refund is KEKW
[1:09:24] NightMunchies: mounts priced changed yes
[1:09:24] sdotpuff: Mount price changes are not da bomb
[1:09:26] Gashunk1: you can just stop thinking if everything is handed to you
[1:09:27] Xottz: who cares about mount price just get 1 gold blood coin in like 3 STVs :)
[1:09:27] voncline88: the gold reduction was a slap in the face to anyone who bought a mount already.  oh you were faster than some people?  u have to pay more
[1:09:27] richdawg: but you will make less gold while leveling since you do it quicker so the mount being cheaper makes sense
[1:09:28] blloodwheell: one thing we need is less bots
[1:09:28] weegey: Short term "fun" planning is how retail got to the point now where they have to completely change their outlook....games should plan for long term if they wanna last
[1:09:29] bchamp93: getting gold in SoD is easy for ANY class
[1:09:29] saund: mages can just get the STV mount in two events by the looks of that last pic LuL  @Xaryu
[1:09:30] vooltage7: i am all the "sweaty" players who had gdkp gold was a nice lil sink :)
[1:09:31] feefo12: its a seasonal mode tho
[1:09:31] iiTzCrayZ: I think it is
[1:09:33] aseoun: i want a refund on the 2 full price mounts i already paid for lol
[1:09:35] Pixiepantss: YESSSSSSS thank you xaryu
[1:09:35] askinforit: nobody is getting a refund y’all are coping
[1:09:35] roxzssx: true
[1:09:37] alrik_plays: Its a Season, i dont want to spend 10 days lvling alts to 40
[1:09:37] lehighvalleyfc: I think blizz saw how many subs have been dropping from SoD lol
[1:09:37] FaluranTV: I agree with you, if this wasn't a seasonal server. this is supposed to be a short term longeivity and time commitment from players
[1:09:38] limburgse: that sounds more like retail
[1:09:38] bellyguud: yeah you have to remember its seasonal
[1:09:38] Gashunk1: you can just stop thinking if everything is handed to you EZ
[1:09:38] die__lon: these changes should have been delayed more to not screw people that just leveled and farmed gold. would make more sense closer to P3 as a compromise
[1:09:39] omwforyogirl: Sounds like its more ways to combat gold buying?
[1:09:40] iddqd_lagtime: feels lke with everything in SoD you spend gold on waylaid rep, now people are making gold of it
[1:09:40] king_king10: nu wow is everyone needs to be the same level
[1:09:41] FIREMAGZZ: how do you feel about the waylaid gold quest reward?
[1:09:41] NotASkiller: but what if people have 5 kids :(
[1:09:42] LaneWillingham: they should add a quest line for those that already paid full price for their mount that rewards them with the excess gold they wasted
[1:09:43] JNOFI: BIG DISAGREE
[1:09:46] Pilky02: Blizzard always overdo shit
[1:09:46] Lilpancakezz: fuck blizzard
[1:09:47] mr4koo: some have 4 or 5 chars and 100g per mount is insane and thats a right step. xp not so much
[1:09:47] ripwarlock2: We've already seen how this all plays out with retail and people want it again. Makes 0 sense.
[1:09:48] lichskunk74: Xar.. the entire game is pay to win now, why I quit after 16 years.. its cringe
[1:09:49] NelsonGamingShow: no way
[1:09:49] namesbuck: Thats just how life has become, give in make it easy for everyone which isn't teaching anyone anything
[1:09:50] thebus7: first content creator actually backing the essence of CLASSIC - retail/other influx of players are the ones loving these changes
[1:09:50] Tomalegendary: But it is making the game more accessible for people with less time to play
[1:09:50] aseoun: im sending aggrend a cod for the wasted mount money i spent
[1:09:51] Phubbs: at this point just give them a level 40 character
[1:09:51] roxzssx: xp boost for the lazy ppl
[1:09:53] ralphh1541: yep like era :)
[1:09:55] tomfxs: Woke blizzard appealing to everyone
[1:09:56] ShutrMcGavin: the game is already crazy easy with the runes
[1:09:56] deathbykeegs: @hirshberg if you want instant gratification go play retail?
[1:09:58] BCboy_: WutFace paragraph chat
[1:09:59] ladyb0y420: We are 5 weeks in, halfway the phase prob.. And many casuals dont ahve time to level an alt to test the different classes etc? its 100% the right play @Xaryu
[1:10:00] greinerr: the xp buff has gotten multiple of my friends to even try sod
[1:10:02] K3tchup_33: but SOD might not be a long term game mode like classic is. Who's to say what happens to SOD in a year
[1:10:03] Big_Zum: SoD xp buff rn good 1 year server. classic plus shouldn’t have xp buff.
[1:10:04] adam_brisbane: they did not opt out of event either
[1:10:06] ColePowerz: ask other ally streamers to help
[1:10:07] budmodeos: xaryu I’m glad we agree. it;’s a bummer
[1:10:08] penteekk: i agree the game should be for botters streamers and jobless people
[1:10:08] dextuhx: its easy to say stuff like this when ur a 1 character andy. let people have their fun, shit will be adjusted. youll be off the game in 2 weeks reacting to youtube content i guarantee it
[1:10:08] LJimbox: remove the buff from the boss, makes it too easy to get bloods
[1:10:09] FrennLaugh: The exp boost is something made by the community. People get miserable because they can't play what they want and have to pay gold to join raids, or relevel
[1:10:09] Dragunstorm15: right but sod is not classic it is its own separate thing
[1:10:10] Docoda: Did his heal get nerfed?
[1:10:11] Quanum_Physics: i feel like I grinder to 40 for no reason 🤦🏽‍♂️
[1:10:13] PriorERA: How does an xp boost prevent prolonging the game's longevity, though?  If people are gonna quit after a little bit at max level, they will whether they get there in 1 week or 2 weeks.
[1:10:15] bendelat: @Xaryu giving easier stuff for 1st character is not the right direcxtion, giving for 5th caracter is absolutely the right thing. How can you say it's immersiove doing same thing for 4th or 5th time?
[1:10:31] faddatv: lvling boost and lower prices for mounts extends the longevity of the phase because it incentivizes alts allowing for more pug runs raid logging
[1:10:35] Niffah: Well that guy plays in the brightness setting of the sun.. Wtf
[1:10:36] liightzouut: these same people complaining about leveling alts are the same people complaioning about how much gold it costs for mounts and CRAFTABLE EPICS.... everyone wants everything now with very little grind
[1:10:38] tacodoc: They'll never give it to us
[1:10:41] samuxtv: Again its the same arguement, if you want it harder there is Hardcore, Safe found, Classic era
[1:10:43] SilverBugeye: they couldd have done WAAAAAY more with the saber mount from STV
[1:10:44] M1ntss: duckHuh
[1:10:45] SilverBugeye: so plain
[1:10:49] meatballsammich: sods maybe gonna last a year. this is for fast data collection. I doubt classic + will have these extreme qol changes @xaryu
[1:10:49] jakeo92: Believe it or not, the boss being in arena for that pictue was because my druid kites it there from nessingway. Our guild created a choke point in arena to keep alliance griefers out for kill attempt
[1:10:50] blazzedzz: I'd agree if it wasn't a seasonal server that is just a beta to create the future classic + real launch
[1:10:52] HogwartsLegacyOfficial: yes
[1:10:53] Ervill1: 4Head
[1:11:05] brodiebrohan: @xaryu all these changes are just going to force classic players back to era severs and they will make something cool again like HC.
[1:11:06] Hirshberg: @deathbykeegs you make it seem like you can buy lvl boost like in retail, relax
[1:11:07] Gashunk1: champion
[1:11:10] JNOFI: @Xaryu you are biased because you play the game as a job, and that's fine, but the often-maligned casual gamer is exactly the target audience for Classic+. Both retail and Wotlk Classic are much more sweaty.
[1:11:18] tacodoc: Isn't bengal tiger a make a wish 1 of a kind item?
[1:11:20] Pixiepantss: LMFAO
[1:11:21] deathbykeegs: @hirshberg you can? xD
[1:11:25] TodBobertson: Why you remove that guy?
[1:11:36] Pixiepantss: LOOOL

[1:11:40] Pixiepantss: ROFLL
[1:11:50] Pixiepantss: ROFL
[1:11:53] Hirshberg: @deathbykeegs you cant buy a lvl 40 boost with money from blizzard, so no you can't
[1:11:57] PMA_1: lmfao
[1:11:57] M1ntss: duckLel
[1:12:10] MEDICx87: that's how i feel when women cut their hair short...

[1:13:07] kirk_hunts: 255
[1:13:07] Occidi: yours wouldnt be too different but going from kratos to baby is a shock for sure KEKW
[1:13:11] Zanrill: is SSF a separate server?
[1:13:15] DragoncakezZz: you drink coffee?
[1:13:18] Nillster: Thanks for the reminder @Krisics
[1:13:21] brini1234: @Xaryu  DO you drink or smoke bro ?

[3:14:22] dyriksaurusrex: maybe opting in the even and having the blood will make you do more
[3:14:23] xonan69: @Xaryu maybe you guys need to turn off the event protection buff
[3:14:23] topperwein1923: opt in and get stacks try to kill when you have blood stacks
[3:14:23] handy_grenade: maybe something to do with the ears he collects

[3:14:30] guhsilqueira: try no dots lul
[3:14:31] Melkor_Active: @xaryu maybe he works like blooddrinkers in ZG. You need to outrange the aoe life drain maybe?
[3:14:31] Diabeathis: charge the altar
[3:14:31] AchillezHeals: It got 54% because one person was kiting it and they didn't die. Everytime he kill's someone he heals. Need someone to kite it around in the arena and not die
[3:14:31] nikweberr: 255 coins
[3:14:31] drewskii318: someone asked earlier if you were sure that he went down to 50 or increases his health

[3:14:32] jackpepsimba: aint no way lmao

[3:14:35] neodude24: it’s literally a world PvP boss why would you opt out
[3:14:35] AndoBotzz: kinda looks bugged to be honest, crazy healing and the random drop
[3:14:36] MKDarker: nah
[3:14:37] yogenrylo: You shouldnt even be allowed to kill the boss if you're not opt'd in to the event. you're literally greifing the event for everyone else

[3:14:39] kaelan: @Xaryu Try kiting him out of STV - maybe hes buffed by the bloodmoon
[3:14:39] SunYuHong: did the boss die yet?
[3:14:40] peterdinkl4ge: 15 hunters, 15 shadow priests, 5 healrs 5 tanks
[3:14:40] Burritosalad: you need to sub with prime to kill it
[3:14:41] slarenoff: @Xaryu In my opinion when he got to the altar he turned in his acquired kills which made him weaker in return
[3:14:42] kharma99: EVERYONE STACK to 255 BLOODS PULL BOSS AND TAKE TO ALTER. MAKE SURE HES ON ALTER AND HAND IN BLOODS. EZ GG
[3:14:42] peterdinkl4ge: kite to SW

[3:14:51] IanEdgerton: what if you have to be opted in to be able to not heal boss
[3:14:52] FUTUREDsm: Maybe you guys do more damage to him if you have more Blood coin stacks?
[3:14:52] Shiggitty: eventually he'll be bigger than the zone itself
[3:14:52] solymer: my theory is the devs interwined something with lore, with the alter or the event.
[3:14:53] kickdotcom_: use necrotic strike
[3:14:53] JukezZA: HE SPAWNS BY AN ALTAR EVERYTIME SO IT HAS TO BE THE WAY TO KILL HIM

[3:14:55] Degran: @churuby That's a technical limitation, buff stacks can't go over 255
[3:14:56] pssdoffchristoph: BE IN THE EVENT AND FIGHT WITH HORDE TOGETHER
[3:14:56] Seoken1: You need to limit the # of people in range, so DPS ONLY steps in together and burn's ALL Cd's, then step out. Then the 2nd DPS raid group steps in and cycles their damage, rinse repeat
[3:14:57] Genghish: He heals because youre not in the event
[3:14:58] benjaminmathias: how many trophies?

[3:15:07] Reck179: GARY?

[3:15:14] Pixiepantss: that was brutal
[3:15:14] Gryphaaa: its just basic computer science
[3:15:14] Melkor_Active: @xaryu maybe he works like blooddrinkers in ZG. You need to outrange the aoe life drain maybe?

[3:15:28] jujujay_myalias: Think about how you kill Hakkar. He heals off everyone in the raid but you turn his drain against him
[3:15:28] teknison: Maybe turning in blood reduces the number of ears he has

[3:15:49] JukezZA: LESS PEOPLE = BETTER

[3:15:49] altopowder: 255 biggest signed 8 bit integer  lolzo

[3:16:13] jujujay_myalias: Think about how you kill Hakkar. He heals off everyone in the raid but you turn his drain against him
[3:16:14] nagard90: Maybe just 1 raid full of range and pets tank
[3:16:14] bpwryl: Whoever has aggro should jump into the arena so that I constantly just bounces up and down the stairs

[3:17:50] espi: @Xaryu what if the raid deals more damage if you have more bloods on you?
[3:17:51] Heln0k: turning it bloods does not hurt boss
[3:17:52] ttvtracerg: OPT IN AND TURN IN BLOODS
[3:17:52] lyrickuhui: blizz taking notes on how to prepare him
[3:17:53] NOHEARTs4: Nice ads
[3:17:54] cocopops7: where do you see the loot for this boss?
[3:17:55] ronke420: it heals boos makes more sence
[3:17:55] rootbeamm: @xaryu imagine the boss is actually controlled by a GM LOL
[3:17:55] hothandzztcg: YOU HAVE TO BRING HIM COINS
[3:17:56] GoldenFool69: You need to find out his altar where he can turn in his ears maybe.
[3:17:56] bryn_dee: You need to participate in the event to kill him
[3:17:56] EmilTuT: It would make sense if he takes damage by handing in the ears he got
[3:17:58] 13brill: NO RAIDS, ALL OPT IN
[3:17:58] moilert: Horde probably got alot of bloods and turned in when he was near
[3:17:58] Carepai: but we always aoe at altar 0 dmg to boss
[3:17:59] Eggzactly54: get half the raids to opt in half out
[3:18:00] RedFlea1: @Xaryu what if you need to die on the altar
[3:18:00] Eastgrove117: Kite him to different altars and offer coins.
[3:18:00] cStevey: @Xaryu Opt-in, have 0 blood, get leeched
[3:18:01] Kfclol2912: @xaryu what about your debuff stacks ?
[3:18:01] garzzyy: maybe turning in 2500 coins takes off the buff
[3:18:01] naturalduck: Save bloods in a previous event
[3:18:02] yoojaymoney: something about turning in bloods forsure i feel like
[3:18:02] Nize2: or farm each other till we get enough
[3:18:03] NGianga: get full stacks then opt out?
[3:18:03] chobinhood_: wintrading Pog
[3:18:03] stormlightcookie: all stack on altar with boss
[3:18:03] mattynuts: @Xaryu nah dude. If you do STV event you turn in coins near the boss the entire event. Doesn't affect his hp.
[3:18:03] Merkkinz: @xaryu what if it's just turning copper into silver
[3:18:03] RubisNosetti: We can farm each other fine??
[3:18:03] Pragma8123: Maybe the more blood you have, the more damage you do @Xaryu
[3:18:05] sewerbeast: farm each other for coins
[3:18:05] PMA_1: tweet it at josh @Xaryu
[3:18:06] nemcoy: farm eachother
[3:18:06] RubisNosetti: we get blood each other
[3:18:06] hothandzztcg: YOU HAVE TO BRING HIM COINS XARRRR
[3:18:06] cookie_jayy: pull him near altar and turn in coins
[3:18:06] Strakattackx: farm coins one event and turn in another
[3:18:07] andypandynz: this is clearly for youtube content cause nobody makes stuffthat requires 100s of people and streamers to co ordinate
[3:18:08] Heln0k: TURNING IN BLOODS DOES NOT HURT BOSS 100%
[3:18:08] durag696: LUL
[3:18:09] CrazyEasy: or just farm eachother :P
[3:18:09] Jeffthis: kill him with high blood stacks
[3:18:09] dumpdeer: farm each other
[3:18:10] hutchyy917: don’t you also get debuff for raid
[3:18:10] xProloli: people normally do event like that and boss is fine
[3:18:11] itsmikebent: Everyone has to save their blood coins of 255 then everyone do the event
[3:18:11] Bigten119: Try getting poisoned like the Hakkar fight. He will take damage instead of healing.
[3:18:12] happyhippo0815: you can kill PVE Mobs and also get coins
[3:18:12] wankels: Win trading confirmed
[3:18:12] Lethander54: Can't you just save the kills from what event to another @Xaryu ?
[3:18:13] stimxlol: Make everyone use light of elune and nuke him in 10 seconds
[3:18:13] bademmett: yes
[3:18:14] Thiccnuggie: what if we get blood
[3:18:15] xonan69: pop off the protection from loa
[3:18:16] darkowitz1444: You can stack coins in a previous event
[3:18:16] kaelan: @Xaryu Try kiting him out of STV - maybe hes buffed by the bloodmoon
[3:18:17] glestytv: thats what I was going to say
[3:18:17] Jinthus: i'd say just get a 10k hp tank and a bunch of heals, there was one that survived 2 hits
[3:18:17] darkowitz1444: And save them
[3:18:17] ThatGuestreal: max blood isnt like 250 -255?
[3:18:18] sewerbeast: we just farm each other
[3:18:18] Viisionz74: Viisionz74 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Blood Leach: Drains 415 to 535 health from nearby enemies, healing the caster for up to twice the amount stolen. you need to keep him away from the range and with minimal melee
[3:18:21] i_am_cakes: gimme the channel points g dang it
[3:18:21] nikweberr: target boss as you turn in?
[3:18:22] Unusual_Steeze: never seen the boss health go down when i turn in coins
[3:18:22] EbbandFlow_: You can hold bloods after event and then turn it off. Just dont die
[3:18:22] metzii12: Do offerings remove his stacks so he's weaker?
[3:18:23] coronalight18: kiting altar to altar and opting in an earning bloods/tunring in sound like the most likely
[3:18:23] ryandrewu: maybe the boss gives blood when you opt in and damage him
[3:18:23] yoojaymoney: if youre optd out i feel like he heals more
[3:18:24] bademmett: ya but no one is dpsing boss
[3:18:24] Qiima1: maeby you need to be part of event so he dont heal?
[3:18:25] Nimbus723: maybe it reduces his healing though
[3:18:26] Phav: it doesn't make sense that you would need 9 raid groups to kill him. it also doesn't make sense that you would be able to kill him without being a part of the event. you guys are missing some mechanics
[3:18:26] FaluranTV: cant be in a raid then tho
[3:18:27] heyimtazz: what if you dealt more damage the more blood stacks you ahgve
[3:18:27] cStevey: @Xaryu Opt-in, have 0 blood on buff, get leeched for nothing or negative because you have none on you
[3:18:27] themadfeltcher: What if it's converting copper into silver?
[3:18:28] churuby: farm eachother and stack 255 and every1 turn in at the same time
[3:18:28] jbeemerks: gotta have the blood debuff and focus boss
[3:18:28] Reck179: COINS REMOVE STACKS
[3:18:28] espi: @Xaryu what if the raid deals more damage if you have more bloods on you?
[3:18:29] HoppsAlot: This is so cool having to discover what the hell's going on
[3:18:29] colonelrunaway: Just poison everyone then maybe he steals them like hakkar
[3:18:29] moka_master: are we thinking the GM hit a little tease dropping him to 50%??
[3:18:29] PMA_1: send a tweet to josh @Xaryu
[3:18:29] Reck179: COINS REMOVE STACKS 󠀀
[3:18:29] Diddly_dope: NO LARGE GROUPS?
[3:18:30] thecone504: kite to SW angle
[3:18:30] ronke420: he heals from blood ?
[3:18:30] realandtruephobe: I missed the GM stuff because of ads
[3:18:31] Seoken1: Right but you would have no idea if it reduced his armor by 10k etc, unless you try
[3:18:31] ttvtracerg: OPT IN AOE ON BOSS NEAR AN ALTAR! = GG
[3:18:32] Bigten119: Treat it like Hakkar
[3:18:32] TobyNova: You need to really look in to what happened when he dropped down to 50% from 80% @Xaryu
[3:18:33] kb_h: maybe he only full heals when he kills people opted out
[3:18:34] hubbardhs: would be EZ with no pvp
[3:18:34] whiskeyslim_: you just have to outdps the blood leech with the players that are in range llol...
[3:18:35] realandtruephobe: what did the GM say?
[3:18:35] Tymo314: have everyone go into the event with 255 bloods
[3:18:36] gethsta: maybe you do more damage when you have stacks of blood?
[3:18:36] Saravyn: @Xaryu could turning in coins remove his stacks or lower them ??
[3:18:37] Tanthok: Just get small groups of ppl to turn in on horde and a raid group to hold him @Xaryu
[3:18:37] MaisLa0712: its not about it bringing his health down, it puts up a damage multiplier that wrecks him through his healing
[3:18:37] ripprrooster: Coins remove the buffs
[3:18:37] nagard90: One full range raid and tank with few hunter pets, too many ppl will heal him badly
[3:18:38] saund: what if BOTH horde + ALLI attack = more damage @Xaryu
[3:18:40] juice42069: ever thought he just wasnt meant to be killed?
[3:18:40] drille: maybe u dispel his stacks with the coins?
[3:18:40] bpwryl: los
[3:18:41] LINK8N: Maybe yo do more dmg if u have bloods on u
[3:18:41] Thiccnuggie: i liked the island idea
[3:18:42] IMP4LER_: maybe handing coins in heals him
[3:18:42] shalomski: Everyone,  get max blood, then join raid, and then hand in all at once as can hand in anytime
[3:18:42] cykoblast: there is a way forsure
[3:18:43] jbeemerks: Zg island. the zandalari will help
[3:18:43] wreckshoptv: kite him too booty bay
[3:18:44] ItzBeardMan: die with corrupted blood?
[3:18:44] paxxack: maybe boss get heal for all damage from people who are not op in
[3:18:45] Snorlax_King: what if what the GM said is a riddle @Xaryu
[3:18:45] LocoEvo2011: maybe only heals off people that are opted out?
[3:18:46] arcadus27: Stack up blood from previous events, enter the new event with 1000 blood per person and all turn it at once
[3:18:46] jujujay_myalias: Think about how you kill Hakkar. He heals off everyone in the raid but you turn his drain against him
[3:18:47] hothandzztcg: THEY HAVE TO HAVE COINS
[3:18:47] Slickk34: isn’t coins a sacrifice for him
[3:18:47] GoldenFool69: Coin turn ins make him stop self healing maybe?
[3:18:48] seukas: @Xaryu having bloods works liek a shield to prevent healin when the boss hits you @Xaryu
[3:18:48] Melkor_Active: @xaryu maybe he works like blooddrinkers in ZG. You need to outrange the aoe life drain maybe?
[3:18:48] Gamalimbo: 100 mages with arcane surge = GG @Xaryu
[3:18:49] ColePowerz: we need dataminers
[3:18:52] ourforcesready: maybe he doesn't do his blood leech if you continuously offer him blood
[3:18:53] hothandzztcg: EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE COINS BRO
[3:18:53] Masteve: Why do u have 11 sad faces on you screen? ? ?
[3:18:54] ThrokkTheWarrior: mortal strike him ?
[3:18:54] Dental_Buffalo: blood makes you do more dps against him
[3:18:55] devistonia1337: @Xaryu I think you can LoS the blood leech if you knew when it was gonna happen
[3:18:56] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[3:18:56] maximo469: THERE WERE ADDS REPEAT THE LAST 4 MINUTES RN
[3:18:56] GoldenFool69: Got to be with coins.
[3:18:57] TiPauloDnD: @arcadus27 its 250 max
[3:18:57] Slickk34: maybe it’s no coins at all
[3:18:57] limburgse: KEKW
[3:18:57] daschadwick: did they kill the boss
[3:18:59] InsertYourseIf: 5Head
[3:19:00] HawnkTV: @Xaryu as he steals your blood what about to try to die having sickness debuff? or something like that
[3:19:01] BrewTTV: Coins remove stacks of his trophies?
[3:19:02] ronke420: he heals from blood ?
[3:19:02] thiccgoat1: didnt u die to reflective dmg from your living bomb?? Surely thats what heals him. @Xaryu
[3:19:02] Maehdras18: @Xaryu give the boss corrupted blood debuff from ZG lol
[3:19:03] Thiccnuggie: hugeeeeeeeeeeee
[3:19:03] Zynotlive: stack mortal strikes
[3:19:04] carlosantonioar: THE MORE BLOOD YOU HAVE THE LESS THE BOSS HEALS XARYU!!
[3:19:05] kaelan: @Xaryu Try kiting him out of STV - maybe hes buffed by the bloodmoon
[3:19:05] Diddly_dope: no large groups
[3:19:05] the_snarf: except he resists 90% of them lol
[3:19:07] Chrigss: what was the gm message
[3:19:08] Bigten119: Need to be poisoned
[3:19:08] Viisionz74: I subbed just so I can tell you
[3:19:10] mariahcarries: the devs did say in an interview that he would be stronger vs full raid groups
[3:19:11] shalomski: Hand in coins once max as can hand in anytime xar
[3:19:11] RubisNosetti: Arcane mages healing the raid next time will help a lot
[3:19:11] ItzBeardMan: i think it's something with corrupted blood
[3:19:12] Catalystic_Sudo: the GM just did something I swear it matches the time line
[3:19:12] Lethander54: Did you put wound poison on?
[3:19:13] BadGerbilLion: @Xaryu clip of 50% hp??
[3:19:13] D4KiR: you need 100 raids
[3:19:14] Snipezillz: detect magic maybe
[3:19:14] Sjintao: +79k
[3:19:14] GoldenFool69: You can't opt out of the event and kill the boss imo.
[3:19:15] dr1asti: maybe the GREED is the answer and as many kills you give him so much weaker gets!
[3:19:15] Pixiepantss: thats hilarious the GM said something LUL
[3:19:16] cStevey: @Xaryu Optin, Have 0 blood stacks on you, get leeched for nothing, --- or Bring an opted in raid and see if leech kills him with the raid debuff
[3:19:16] Seoken1: You need any person that is not doing damage to step out during the leach, ideally you would cycle 4 raids stepping in/out every 1 minute individually @Xaryu
[3:19:16] arcadus27: Stack up blood from previous events, enter the new event with 1000 blood per person and all turn it at once
[3:19:17] nagard90: One full range raid and tank with few hunter pets, too many ppl will heal him badly
[3:19:17] birkaq: Xar, will you be playing HC SSF tomorrow?
[3:19:18] realandtruephobe: @carlosantonioar That is a good idea
[3:19:18] hothandzztcg: coins THE MORE BLOOS THE LESS DMG DUDE
[3:19:21] cardonish: -30 minutes
[3:19:21] gdub1177: What is that debuff?!
[3:19:22] limburgse: GO AGANE!
[3:19:23] Chrigss: what was the gm message?
[3:19:23] tyrann1cal: the gm 100% put the boss to 50% to give you the idea that you had a chance @Xaryu
[3:19:23] roberttlight: maybe its ur mage duel strat - with each mage ice blocking
[3:19:25] whiskeyslim_: what did gm say
[3:19:26] ronke420: he heals from blood ? he heals from blood ? he heals from blood ? he heals from blood ? he heals from blood ?
[3:19:27] TobyNova: When does he respawn?
[3:19:28] ewok7777: The boss punishes you for being in a raid.....
[3:19:31] drippyy212: need to break down the Blizz message
[3:19:31] Bigten119: Get poisoned for blood leach
[3:19:32] andypandynz: this is like going into tbc and thinking the fel reaver does morethan just kill and drop nothing
[3:19:32] Grocery7: maybe giving blood in altar gives him a debuff where he doesnt heal as much
[3:19:34] Skratch480: Maybe if you collect stacks of blood, and he casts his heal, he takes your stacks and damages himself? So you want to go collect a bunch of bloods before pulling him all at once?
[3:19:37] 13brill: GO OUT OF RAID
[3:19:39] kaelan: @Xaryu Try kiting him out of STV - maybe hes buffed by the bloodmoon
[3:19:39] slarenoff: @Xaryu In my opinion when he got to the altar he turned in his acquired kills which made him weaker in return since he lost all his stacks
[3:19:42] bolmaden: dont think its killable, designed to get more coins when you fight near him. Just gm trolling imo
[3:19:43] gentlehugs: @Xaryu a group kited him outside of stv last night and it just reset
[3:19:43] Lagbolta: End the prediction
[3:19:45] Beanslices: Do horde still get blood from you if they kill you?
[3:19:46] MewhTV: @Xaryu isnt there a way to negate the leech effect?
[3:19:46] cykoblast: no way
[3:19:46] braxEZze: @xaryu what if you convert coins. Will that do something?
[3:19:47] nagard90: One full range raid and tank with few hunter pets, too many ppl will heal him badly....
[3:19:47] Melkor_Active: @xaryu maybe he works like blooddrinkers in ZG. You need to outrange the aoe life drain maybe?
[3:19:48] jalfo2727: GM took out 40% and trolling you guys
[3:19:48] sl0thdc: @Xaryu kite to booty bay?
[3:19:49] Craigumander: Kite to bb and let guards take care of it LUL
[3:19:50] nikweberr: target boss as you turn in coins
[3:19:51] Lagbolta: Oh nvm
[3:19:52] Locofanta: dont u get the same message as the GM when u turn in blood?
[3:19:52] canidius: is there some kind of link with hakkar? maybe some debuff that makes his heal deal damage 8nstead?
[3:19:53] Tanthok: One large group to hold him and heal tanks and then get stream fan to kill horde and turn in. @Xaryu
[3:19:53] yoojaymoney: how long will it take to get to SW KEKW
[3:19:54] mirichan5000: you wont have time to bring him that far
[3:19:55] Goobadoobadoob: He despawns if you take him out of stv
[3:19:55] Oddfin: is it even intended to be killed?
[3:19:56] ewok7777: The boss punishes you for being in a raid......
[3:19:57] kigami_uro: he resets when he is taken to duskwood
[3:19:57] metzii12: I can only imagine you have to be opted into the event and it has to do with the offerings.
[3:19:58] MaisLa0712: i dont think kiting him to X place is whats necessary. Its a mechanic that you guys dont know exactly that you need to figure out
[3:19:59] kaizyone: Have everyone prefarm 255 coins and then turn in alltogether on the next event maybe?
[3:20:00] Fillelit: What if he only heals from people opted out?
[3:20:01] nbozh: What if you just don’t have to return any bloods on any of the altars. Maybe returning is healing him…
[3:20:01] shalomski: Get max blood in 1 event, dont hand in, join raid, all hand in together @xaryu
[3:20:01] carlosantonioar: THE MORE BLOOD U HAVE THE LESS THE BOSS HEALS!
[3:20:03] xProloli: TRY TO DROWND HIM
[3:20:03] turboer: the GM wrote: The blood loa accepts your generous offerings
[3:20:04] ScatManGo: Bring Kazzak to fight him
[3:20:04] xtinzyx: into zg
[3:20:05] themadfeltcher: Season of DISCOVERING... how to kill the unkillable event boss
[3:20:05] thebus7: Will he aggro the ZG Elites?
[3:20:06] juice42069: bring him into ZG
[3:20:06] WhySoSerious04: Yah both factions must be able to kill him if possible
[3:20:07] jujujay_myalias: Think about how you kill Hakkar. He heals off everyone in the raid but you turn his drain against him
[3:20:08] bottis96: anti streamer mechanic  cant just outnumber him
[3:20:08] Njang: Tried the same Mechanic as you use to kill Hakkar, find a way to get your blood corrupted before you donate it?
[3:20:09] romanisroamin: Why would he be killable but also need 3 raids to do so?!
[3:20:09] xtinzyx: INTO ZG
[3:20:10] thebus7: war of trolls
[3:20:11] SelWrynn: Would Booty Bay guards help?
[3:20:12] Azcendia: he cant swim
[3:20:12] jdraken: Boss awakeakens if you get enough blood kills
[3:20:12] SpaceCowboy0811: how do you get everyone on the same layer in grps of 5 @Xaryu no shot thats the answer
[3:20:15] YzieGG: its the stacks for sure
[3:20:22] Incognymous: It's for sure something with the bruised debuff
[3:20:22] treyywow: maybe if youre in the event it won’t heal him as much when he heals and it’s just dps at that point @xaryu
[3:20:23] RoonGaming: In ZG you kill the last boss by poisoning your blood
[3:20:23] GoldenFool69: Can you kite Teremus to him?
[3:20:24] juice42069: he can swim ive seen him
[3:20:25] justskeeting11: take him on the boat from booty bay
[3:20:27] RubisNosetti: Bruised buff I think gives him less healing
[3:20:30] Kazay1998: @Xaryu what if they will end the Phase2 by making the event so you kill him?
[3:20:31] Bigten119: He will heal unless he steals poisoned blood
[3:20:31] realandtruephobe: I think getting everyone full stack bloods before attempting is the play
[3:20:31] romanisroamin: It doesn't make sense you need that many people. The entire event is based in small party fights
[3:20:31] Qiima1: i think you need to be part of the event
[3:20:31] andypandynz: blizzard cant even make new content in sod and u guys thinkthey have an elaborate way to kill a useless npc LUL
[3:20:36] SpaceCowboy0811: I have 14 lol
[3:20:40] GoldenFool69: BLOOD SACRAFICE
[3:20:40] John_H_Holliday: Sounds like a job for Stitches....
[3:20:42] whiskeyslim_: ^^^
[3:20:47] hothandzztcg: ITS COINS
[3:20:48] kb_h: I doubt you opt out to kill him
[3:20:49] ourforcesready: maybe he doesn't do his blood leech if you continuously offer him blood 󠀀
[3:20:49] Turkeypitz: more bruise - less heals?
[3:20:50] jallaballan: typical alliance behaviour, solution is exploiting and bugging it
[3:20:50] quasarface: he was healing fast af from the start
[3:20:54] Melkor_Active: @xaryu maybe he works like blooddrinkers in ZG. You need to outrange the aoe life drain maybe?
[3:20:55] TobyNova: But he dropped to 50% randomly?!?!
[3:20:55] Incognymous: There's probably a way to remove the bruised debuff
[3:20:55] ewok7777: The boss punishes you for being in a raid.....
[3:20:55] Tanthok: One large group to hold him and heal tanks and then get stream fan to kill horde and turn in. @Xaryu
[3:20:55] hungry_giraffe: That is stupid
[3:20:57] nbozh: What if you just don’t have to return any bloods on any of the altars. Maybe returning is healing him…
[3:20:58] pizac7: having bloods on you = less damage you take / more damage you do ?
[3:20:58] shlipperytv: @Xaryu the bruised buff stops the boss from collecting another ear from you
[3:20:59] angriffxd: @Xaryu make 5 man grps so no debuff
[3:20:59] b1azzuris: @andypandynz TRUE KEKW
[3:20:59] mrfaabs: That would explain why you had such a good start
[3:21:01] rchrdk: guess he sucks out your blood so you have to corrupt your blood like at hakkar fight or smth @Xaryu
[3:21:03] stormlightcookie: @Xaryu https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=437715/blood-leech
[3:21:03] Pragma8123: @Xaryu more blood stacks you have, the more damage you do maybe?
[3:21:04] Brujablazing: Maybe you have to kill him when youre dead =P
[3:21:04] jdp216: this is cool
[3:21:04] Bigten119: Poisonous blood will kill him
[3:21:06] whiskeyslim_: its hilarious yall think blizz put more than 12 mins of brainpower into this boss
[3:21:06] Etheom: try sacrificing the whole raid like 10 times to max debuffs
[3:21:07] DanPlaysChess: LOL don't be weird chat
[3:21:08] sthfishyhere: maybe fatigue kill him?
[3:21:09] canidius: is there some kind of link with hakkar? maybe some debuff that makes his heal deal damage instead? some kind of poison somewhere?
[3:21:10] stormlightcookie: thats the heal! @Xaryu
[3:21:12] Decimas1: string of ears is diablo item
[3:21:13] shipy14: @Xaryu what if a ZG vendor takes the blood coins during the event for an item or something to help kill him
[3:21:14] MisterThatDude: Wowhead says you can’t be charged with bruised rebuff
[3:21:15] SghettiBoy: was there a prompt that brought this challenge on?
[3:21:15] mrfaabs: The very first pull you had was good because none of you were bruised
[3:21:16] balart: overthinking blizzard actually came with something clever to "kill" this boss, probably is not even killable KEKW
[3:21:21] azshare_: didnt the world boss dragons give you a debuff that makes it so you cant kill?
[3:21:21] ThrokkTheWarrior: MORTAL STRIKE
[3:21:22] legozoro: bring the boss into the water
[3:21:23] Udenwo: Where's the data miners at when you need em
[3:21:23] mattynuts: @andypandynz I think they probably haven't thought that far as to making the boss killable or intended to be killed.   I doubt it's a "secret world boss" mechanic. Wouldn't be surprrised if they add a mechanic in the future.
[3:21:23] Diddly_dope: feel like u cant opt out, no large groups, hord and ally damage
[3:21:23] Azcendia: cant bring him zg Island cant swim
[3:21:24] Bigten119: Need to be poisoned
[3:21:24] jackpepsimba: There is no way they want you to swim the boss out to Yojamba, this is not gonna be it lmao
[3:21:32] asloff: bloodleech has a 45 yard range
[3:21:33] wankels: Are healers trolling?
[3:21:35] DobsonWireless: My DoTs were getting resisted
[3:21:37] stormlightcookie: Drains 415 to 535 health from nearby enemies, healing the caster for up to twice the amount stolen.
[3:21:40] PROPANIAC: show gm message
[3:21:42] English_Uk: anyone got a screenshot of the Gm thing
[3:21:43] regulater45: Do it without melee
[3:21:43] braxEZze: @xaryu is there any mechanic with converting the coins? Or sacrificing them somehow?
[3:21:44] t1isokatleague: i had no blood and i did alot of dmg............
[3:21:45] andypandynz: @mattynuts its just a fel reaver, this is all for content and people are suckingit upLUL
[3:21:49] Diddly_dope: ez
[3:21:49] miciahclay: WHAT IF YOU ARE ALL IRRADIATED FROM THE GNOMER GEAR AND HE KILLS HIMSELF FROM THE BLOOD DRAIN?!?!
[3:21:49] Seoken1: You want 4 raids, and each raid only steps in to DPS during their  "turn", basically cycling 2-4 minute cooldowns. That way there are only ever 40 people within 45yd range during his heal @Xaryu
[3:21:50] SelWrynn: you also need a raid of pally tanks to bubble taunt @Xaryu
[3:21:51] Brujablazing: Always neglecting melee
[3:21:52] InsertYourseIf: LET'S GO IM IN
[3:21:53] benjocre4m: try when opt in?
[3:21:57] Fai_z: @jackpepsimba I think so too. That's too convoluted
[3:22:00] romanisroamin: Curse of tongues and mind numbing would stop his casts quite a bit
[3:22:04] falsestreams: yeah dood gnomer like 45 min
[3:22:04] ShazChamp: @Xaryu gm hint makes me think every x amount of coins causes him to delay healing by, let's say 30s or something
[3:22:08] arcksuckfrost: Xaryu tooo handsome
[3:22:09] Melkor_Active: @xaryu maybe he works like blooddrinkers in ZG. You need to outrange the aoe life drain maybe?
[3:22:10] Udenwo: not true
[3:22:10] Grevira: I'm Bruised 7 times
[3:22:11] regulater45: What does this number by my name mean?
[3:22:13] themadfeltcher: EVeryone should have been bruised
[3:22:13] Thiccnuggie: false
[3:22:14] vanDinther: @Xaryu maybe he heals more if players have less Blood for the Blood Loa? That you feed him other blood than your own which stops his healing? It's like the  mechanic on Hakkar.
[3:22:14] Nimbus723: did gnomer in 45 mins today
[3:22:16] Pixiepantss: i have 10 stacks of bruise
[3:22:16] MrPankratz: its not true
[3:22:18] kb_h: well he did get to 50% with everyone bruised up
[3:22:19] kindaopmusic: that was fun
[3:22:20] JukezZA: this is the wowhead comment : By Pomodorosan (18,663 – 4·22·116) 6 days ago (Classic) I assume this makes you unable to be targeted by the large troll's charge/execute attack. The bug that made you lose blood has been fixed since the other comments.
[3:22:21] chasingshadowsz: HUH
[3:22:23] Daracus98: what are u reserving
[3:22:23] miciahclay: Everyone in irradiated gear! Maybe the heal would hurt him
[3:22:25] JukezZA: so its not true
[3:22:25] Seoken1: They definitely need to outrange the 45yard AOE heal, that is pretty claer
[3:22:25] gatorsean123456789: GIGACHAD
[3:22:31] chobinhood_: He probably prioritizes people with fewer bruise stacks, so you dont get railed by him constantly
[3:22:33] Bigten119: Get poisoned to stop blood leach healing
[3:22:33] cxn_r: try kiting him to the Rebel Camp in STV theres a 60 elite there: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=469/lieutenant-doren#comments
[3:22:36] mattynuts: @andypandynz I mean dude. Xaryu isn't the only person to attempt this man.  Ashes and a bunch of other guilds got him down to 70% in other attempts.   too much over healing
[3:22:46] hotmanpop: EZ
[3:22:48] richdawg: streamer privilege
[3:22:49] tacodoc: What if you kite him somewhere while he's small land then make him grow to get him stuck?

[3:30:46] bpwryl: @xaryu I think you’re overanalysing the boss. His spell heals based on the amount of people around him. When he went low when he was inside the arena with most people on ledge. If whoever has aggro jumps down in arena when he is at stairs you should be able to keep him away from the big group? Or am I stupid
[3:30:47] Masheck: My group with 6 melees does it in less than 1 hour, with a moonkin parsing gray. Peoples are too sweaty nowadays in SoD with the min/max

[3:31:58] jrdman: MUCKY TROLLING
[3:31:59] swyftboi: sry for repeating but lets get a poll for points going!
[3:31:59] jackpepsimba: @InsertYourseIf I guess you dont play druid or something, but no, that's incorrect. For bombs you do not want a boomy, just a meta lock or sunfire feral

[3:35:27] itsjosso: it seems another reference saying to turn in blood @Xaryu
[3:35:29] Genghish: He said it: Blood for the Blood loa is the hint
[3:35:30] Maehdras18: @Xaryu blood leach from boss is triggered by an ability called "Blood Drive" maybe need max stacks of blood? some type of blood disease?
[3:35:31] NelsonGamingShow: discover it bro
[3:35:31] Reck179: TURN IN BLOOD TO KILL HIM

[3:35:46] Tanthok: One large group to hold him and heal tanks and then get stream fan to kill horde and turn in. I think you need to turn your blood into the boss and not the alter
[3:35:49] saveslol: if everyone gets the tag, maybe you just don’t do a raid?
[3:35:50] stormstruck12: I messaged you a couple weeks ago about my brother having cancer. He got surgery within a week of the diagnosis and his cat scan came back clean. Did not spread.

[3:35:55] Lintin: kinda need ideas :D
[3:35:55] taylorsdank: that was so good
[3:35:56] enoch87bear: Shoulda ask devs at least if he is killable or not
[3:35:56] InsertYourseIf: IT WAS FUN
[3:35:57] bobbuildsitt: There is nothing about the blood loa boss to read. What was he chanting in demonic?

[3:36:06] Lifeles85: YEP I'll be back for the second attempt
[3:36:07] ScootSmith: Everyone in your raid group needs to get a bunch of blood stacks before fighting the boss
[3:36:07] mysherryamour: @Wall_ExD I would do quests until you reach level 20, then you can honestly just spam dungeons like wailing caverns and SFK for exp
[3:36:08] LydigZen: What's a fun Character to make in SoD? Thinking of coming back
[3:36:09] Thiccnuggie: yeah that was fun :)
[3:36:10] kigami_uro: I had fun, I got 800 alliance kills
[3:36:11] SunYuHong: how closedid you get?
[3:36:11] EXiTxi: What was lowest %?
[3:36:11] Szmirk: maybe start boss when you have high stacks of blood?
[3:36:17] taylorsdank: I think that tweet was a hint @Xaryu
[3:36:21] czocze: I only had a 50% blast
[3:36:21] c3relki11er: @kigami_uro farming noobs
[3:36:21] BadGerbilLion: Were you in a raid group?
[3:36:23] jrdman: WAIT MUCKY STILL IN GROUP
[3:36:24] Melkor_Active: @xaryu STACK BLOOD FIRST
[3:36:26] sushileafbeats: need tons of ranged
[3:36:31] RedMillz: What happened? anything learned?
[3:36:32] mysherryamour: @LydigZen warlock has been a blast, huge for DPS and meta lock if you wanna PVP
[3:36:33] Eggzactly54: you didnt fail you just lacked a bit of winning is all @Xaryu
[3:36:33] benjocre4m: dont opt out maybe

[3:36:35] jamerk_: I Had to go afk. was xaryu and friends able to kill the stv blood god?
[3:36:36] limburgse: @Xaryu, maybe not in raidgroup as raidgroups gets punished this event
[3:36:37] HoppsAlot: LOAFY
[3:36:38] deluxogodx: what did the GM said during the attempt?
[3:36:39] Szmirk: @xaryu maybe you start boss encounter when you have high stacks of blood?
[3:36:41] enoch87bear: @Xaryu  what if you gather stacks and then if you have Blood, he doesn't heal and instead just consumes the bloods on you?
[3:36:41] Wall_ExD: @mysherryamour @mysherryamour got it i will continue the level guide till level 20 and i will do that
[3:36:42] Faltteri: maybe he gets healed when people return coins
[3:36:42] Maehdras18: @Xaryu need blood stacks near him when he casts his aoe heal
[3:36:43] thejiggler1: YES!
[3:36:44] uBm3D: theory is: blood loa lives from the blood of fallen players. if no one wights each other but helps to kill him, he will die
[3:36:44] sullyman13: LOAF
[3:36:45] HelluvaWrecks: having blood stacks when he drains maybe hurts him
[3:36:45] chrislu18: I think people do it outside of raid. bunch of 5 man groups. all opted out of the event and somehow all focus boss without murdering everyone
[3:36:46] Dr0ddy: Tavern music goated
[3:36:47] aluskyy: Listening
[3:36:48] alrik_plays: So the boss drops to 50% in one second and you can't figure out why, while a GM is hovering?

[3:37:15] guhsilqueira: what lofi is this
[3:37:18] JukezZA: im telling you @Xaryu what if everytime he charge kills someone on the altar it damages him because of a blood sacrifice
[3:37:19] aluskyy: is pred for first boss or last?
[3:37:20] jrdman: @jordandrones toxic for exposing liars?
[3:37:21] nahitsmedical: Guys I dont think the GM just hit him for 50%hp for no reason

[3:37:40] Zynotlive: @xaryu get some OSRS lo-fi going
[3:37:46] Poolhaus: @Xaryu  maybe being in raid is causing it to heal more. Could try having the same amount of people but all drop group before attacking
[3:37:47] regulater45: Test
[3:37:48] Shirey12: @Xaryu will we see your return for S4 or War Within Alpha?

[3:37:57] aluskyy: oh it says first im special
[3:38:04] chrislu18: The devs have always said "being in raid groups will punish you" maybe not being in a raid and forming a bunch of 5 mans
[3:38:07] Muckbot1: HOLY SHIT MUCKY IS PUMPING
[3:38:08] Lewbra: I feel like if everyone spreads he wont heal as much when he charges and that would be the strat. Obviously tough to coordinate that though
[3:38:09] gustenmm: OSRS music is amazing ^_^
[3:38:10] Witality: any doubters?
[3:38:10] mostlikelyyadad: @xaryu yo g did you get tiger mount or is that later
[3:38:24] jordandrones: @jrdman  look at the dmg....
[3:38:25] moocowthecow: I think you need to get corrupted blood fromzg somehow... OR whole zone starves him to death with no blood. I also think opting mightve hurt.  Go getem!
[3:38:30] alrik_plays: @Lewbra Ah yea, why not spread furrther out than the 45 yards his heal reaches
[3:38:30] yami_yugi_87: Just found a tablet on Yojamba Isla that says "We call upon you, Zanza of Zuldazar.

[3:38:45] sal92mc06: Any clips of what happened with Loa earlier?
[3:38:51] nahitsmedical: @vindiee We have to figure that out, but a GM interfering in that way when we are still trying to figure out mechanics only confuses us more
[3:38:54] silentchil: what tiger mount? did something new come out
[3:38:56] jordandrones: @jrdman  youre complaining about mucky and hes doing fine? BOT

[3:40:08] Skeetcannon79: did ya make it in that new ceramic cookwear?

[3:40:30] moka_master: lil GM tickle
[3:40:31] slarenoff: @Xaryu In my opinion when he got to the altar he turned in his acquired kills which made him weaker in return since he lost all his stacks
[3:40:31] CuppaCoffeh: GM
[3:40:31] clee0724: GM 100%
[3:40:31] reteeh: gm 100%

[3:40:32] Diddly_dope: gm hit on accident
[3:40:32] Goobadoobadoob: He wouldn't have pathed to where he could've taken fall damage
[3:40:33] naomgoat: 100%
[3:40:33] jandoodle2: OMEGALUL he hit his head walking in the arena Kappa
[3:40:33] Lifeles85: EZ Gm for sure
[3:40:34] ralphh1541: GM 100%
[3:40:34] Lintin: yeha gm
[3:40:34] Ayomeer: There are GMs?
[3:40:34] needmoeumph: someone mentioned that maybe his health just doubled which maybe that is the case since he was usually sitting at 100%
[3:40:35] bobbuildsitt: Hp doubling in the last 10 minutes checks out
[3:40:36] regulater45: Definitely trolled by a gm
[3:40:36] andypandynz: @Muckbot1 ur life is how much u make? LUL sad
[3:40:36] aluskyy: an npc taking fall damage? Do you even play the game? LUL
[3:40:38] Lewbra: I think it was a bug or GM I dont think that was actually part of the fight
[3:40:38] manbearpigereeno: to show you're not doing it right
[3:40:39] czocze: something to do with the BLOODS
[3:40:39] Miraelia: either GM or BLOOD
[3:40:39] sushileafbeats: did he instantly drop to 50%?
[3:40:39] GoodguyDan: Swifty maybe did a macro on it
[3:40:41] cxn_r: @Xaryu the wowhead link dono
[3:40:42] ImThatFella: What happened that you're talking about?
[3:40:42] taylorsdank: had to involve the bloods
[3:40:43] miciahclay: @domified This is interesting, what if he just got a buff and doubled his max HP XD
[3:40:43] nickels396: bug or gm yea
[3:40:43] snoozzzzzzzzzz: something to do with blood for sure
[3:40:43] lurkerl0l: either a GM or a rnadom bug
[3:40:44] Lamira: I think it has something to do with fighting together with alliance and horde since its pvp event idk
[3:40:45] mattynuts: @Ayomeer yes
[3:40:45] Zatr0: A GM with lesser martins fury
[3:40:48] packtar: GM but maybe watch the clip if you didn't already
[3:40:48] TokerTy420: GM Jedi mind tricks
[3:40:48] Maehdras18: @Xaryu no, has to do with blood stacks for sure
[3:40:51] MisterUtley: No, you guys found a mechanic. Or he bugged
[3:40:51] Tanthok: Yeah GM. I think that we need next phase for this to work
[3:40:52] slimeuruuu: No way it was a GM, most likely a mechanic
[3:40:53] domified: @miciahclay exactly
[3:40:53] Fyeah: my enormous hammer i have down my pants hit the boss from 90% to 50%
[3:40:53] SuperLost89: @Xaryu what if you need blood stacks from killing people in order to damage him?
[3:40:53] Tmugsy: @Xaryu based on twitters post prio to the event and the post in trade seems like it was a gm
[3:40:57] daLuhz: my only thought was that maybe you have one real shot at it, that if you 'wipe' he gets too big to finish him
[3:40:57] detourz28: Either it was bloods or the GM. Prob the GM though
[3:40:58] DeathToad007: gm's dont exist
[3:40:58] cxn_r: oh my bad, sorry! must have missed it! thanks! @Xaryu
[3:41:01] taylorsdank: had to be a mechanic accidentally done correctly
[3:41:02] Skeetcannon79: i think he got to 50% but was a huge SERVER LAG SPIKE so it looked like it was instantaneous
[3:41:02] mageguy8: elisBall if you get 1500 mages you can all do 4x arcane blast and one shot him with arcane surge
[3:41:03] MKDarker: wasnt it possible to check with details what got him most dmg?
[3:41:04] Thiccnuggie: i liked the island idea
[3:41:04] Eggzactly54: tsake him to stormwind
[3:41:05] mysherryamour: Honestly I think both horde and ally need to work together
[3:41:05] Tzuyami: i feel like you need high bloodstacks to kill him
[3:41:06] UnKillableSold: He hit him to see what will happen, saw you still couldn't do them i bet they will nerf again
[3:41:07] themadfeltcher: I think he gained a buff, like double life, but his base health didn't increase
[3:41:09] mysherryamour: Horde was tryna help
[3:41:13] Melkor_Active: @xaryu when he droped to 50% lot of horde came in and turned in blood while boss was near altar
[3:41:14] DanPlaysChess: hey, type 123 if you're having a good time
[3:41:15] DanPlaysChess: 123
[3:41:16] Trodenskjold: @Fyeah Trying to find it Binoculous
[3:41:17] AbyssReborn: "oopsies I auto attacked the boss" I bet
[3:41:19] Austyz: mechanic, there are 100’s of people someone probably did something that worked
[3:41:21] Skilten: @xaryu Have you considered blood stacks increase your damage done to Khad?
[3:41:23] daLuhz: @Xaryu he seemed like he was taking a lot more damage until he got that first set of ears
[3:41:23] manbearpigereeno: it's the ZG island im calling it
[3:41:36] maaxspeed: did u guys kill the blood god?
[3:41:36] nahitsmedical: A GM doing that is dumb as hell now nobody knows if it was a mechanic or a GM. it wasnt a GM and if it was they need to say something now
[3:41:37] TrueNosus: what if u kited one of those world dragons to him @Xaryu
[3:41:38] bobbuildsitt: I think his health doubled when he got enough trophies, or the 10 minute mark
[3:41:38] Thiccnuggie: @mysherryamour yeah surely the 5 stacked mages AE us the entire time were trying to help
[3:41:44] slarenoff: @Xaryu In my opinion when he got to the altar he turned in his acquired kills which made him weaker in return since he lost all his stacks
[3:41:45] MKDarker: not possible to have watched "details!" on what the boss got most dmg from?
[3:41:46] romanisroamin: I think the GM hit him to show you that even if you got him to 50% it wouldn't matter because it doing the healing mechanic wrong
[3:41:46] yami_yugi_87: there might be a hint found on the tablet found on the Yojamba Isle
[3:41:48] drewskii318: are you sure he went down in health bs health doubled ?
[3:41:49] shalomski: As you can save bloods and hand in anytime, maybe get max stack and form raid for next event, then everyone hands in when bods near altar @xaryu
[3:41:50] packtar: you should analyze the clip of when he dropped to 50%
[3:41:50] TokerTy420: true
[3:41:55] Fyeah: @Trodenskjold ask your mom she knows im tellin ya
[3:41:57] Ayomeer: "One million players" *puts pinky into the corner of his mouth*
[3:41:57] espi: it would be nonsense if you could kill the boss while NOT participating IMO.
[3:42:00] Skeetcannon79: or the boss was just designed not to be killed /shrug, maybe with an 80 man group?
[3:42:01] Miraelia: hasn't it been made so you can only kill him inside event ?
[3:42:04] yami_yugi_87: the tab says "We call upon you, Zanza of Zuldazar. Bless those that ask for your help LOA Zanza bless those that would ally with the Zandalarian people. Aid us in this time of need. Aid us LOA give us the power to strike down our enemies. Give us the power to once more defeat the Blood God"
[3:42:09] imbaman87: Listening gachiGASM
[3:42:16] limburgse: but raidgroups will get punished as they said and as we saw @Xaryu
[3:42:16] Melkor_Active: @xaryu when he droped to 50% lot of horde came in and turned in blood while boss was near altar
[3:42:17] Poolhaus: @Xaryu he could be healing off of people in the targets raid group. if you had a TON of small groups, it would be healing off less people
[3:42:18] Exempt_Instinct: clearly a part of the event
[3:42:19] Trodenskjold: @Fyeah She said she is still looking for it
[3:42:20] 13brill: oh that 1 guy has a point, check details for top dmg
[3:42:20] 666dammit: Thank you mr Streamer! This is the perfect music for going to sleep!
[3:42:20] Sweenes: song?
[3:42:20] Skilten: @espi thats what im thinking. They want to incentivize the event
[3:42:21] mcgitches: i think you should do it the same as before but opt in to the event
[3:42:23] andypandynz: its a fel reaver reskin LUL  its not this deep
[3:42:23] Merik92: is this slowed wow music haha?
[3:42:25] SghettiBoy: I bet he drops absolutely nothing and devs didnt want you to be bummed so they have to retrofit khadamu with some dope item or something
[3:42:32] ronke420: why not just get ther out of raid or group ?
[3:42:33] daLuhz: i think you guys should try bringing him to the arena before he kills a lot of you and claims all of those ear stacks
[3:42:34] trollvald: GRUBBOMON
[3:42:35] mizdirect: Blizzard wouldnt make a mechanic that would make you kite it across the zone
[3:42:40] FIREMAGZZ: ASK THE HORDE TO DO IT THEN GRIEF THEM

[3:43:10] dlune35: the dps rotation look's kinda hard
[3:43:10] ninetysix: i think if you have blood stacks he charges and removes a couple of stacks and deny him healing same as hakar poison debuff. xaryu
[3:43:13] vexsir1: i just got a mail from blizz ingame that a bot i reported got banned
[3:43:16] Dr0ddy: Think it is worth mentioning that the world boss does have a death sound file
[3:43:17] Skeetcannon79: good music bro
[3:43:18] Trodenskjold: @Fyeah I knew she was lying, when she told me she found it, and it was huge

[3:50:11] sweettacoo: did they kill the blood god? had to afk right before it
[3:50:12] ketchgg: one event everyone saves blood, next one you kill boss @Xaryu
[3:50:12] foryoucarter: doesnt explain him dropping to 50 though....
[3:50:12] duusstabil: thats how Hakkar worked in classic
[3:50:12] SavageSeb_: Its basically a guessing game right now
[3:50:13] TEEEEmac: he uses your blood to heal
[3:50:13] mctwist__: Oooh, does he take your blood stacks instead of health?
[3:50:16] wankels: Because I've always had blood
[3:50:16] mattynuts: @sweettacoo no
[3:50:19] mysherryamour: makes sense, aggrend was probably hinting at it
[3:50:21] hate_xyz: chat is so smart NODDERS
[3:50:24] JukezZA: wait so can you just do a whole 30 minute event, not turn it in and then go as a group to kill it?
[3:50:26] mysherryamour: blood for blood loa
[3:50:27] YazzLivee: makes sense why he stacks ears to 255 and blood also goes to 255
[3:50:29] Tmugsy: @Xaryu the boss took 300k 4 times in a row / not sure how having blood would do that
[3:50:29] jandoodle2: SENSE SMOrc  me no sense anymore SMOrc
[3:50:30] RedMillz: @Xaryu One thing I haven't been able to wrap my head around is that you shouldn't have to turn off the event in order to kill the boss...
[3:50:30] andypandynz: i feel like im in a dream with everyone thinking the npc actually drops something or is killable
[3:50:42] sweettacoo: @mattynuts ahh, thanks. wanted to see it, will have to check the vod
[3:50:45] coastcontraog: ehre is the hunter on the meter
[3:50:47] mysherryamour: @RedMillz maybe just a ton of groups of 5
[3:50:51] Witality: together peepoClap
[3:50:51] mattynuts: @YazzLivee the debuff actually has a numerical value of over 2500 by the time the vent was over though
[3:50:52] Ayomeer: idc bringing blood to the blood god doesn't seem like he'd hate that to me
[3:50:55] vindiee: @andypandynz why would they nerf its damage if not killable?
[3:50:59] dieseltacotv: bruh this rogue damage is laughable
[3:50:59] jjuliiuz: xarOMEGALUL

[3:51:12] mattynuts: @sweettacoo TLDR: GM chunked it? Most likely to 50%. But they never got it lower than 80% by themselves.
[3:51:12] dingerdoom: hunter on meters somewhere near the healers
[3:51:13] lonesovl: shobek finding something out about stv boss on his stream theres a tablet you need adjust brightness to read

[3:53:25] English_Uk: There is something regarding the BRUSED debuff. There is no reason for it atm. No logic behind it yet
[3:53:27] sssillyyy: @xmyastinksx hi
[3:53:27] taylorsdank: i always walk away at worst time did they kill boss lol
[3:53:31] adam90k: @trashcanff absolute neck beard chad
[3:53:32] MKDarker: @TerrortheToast sounds too niche for a solution for the event.
[3:53:42] amarv: Healer parse
[3:53:42] clee0724: @taylorsdank yess lmao
[3:53:47] taylorsdank: @clee0724 tytytytyty
[3:53:57] thejiggler1: @taylorsdank  no pretty bad fail
[3:53:58] Mahca_: @english_uk currently you lose more blood when you die while bruised
[3:53:58] trashcanff: @adam90k if I was all those things, I’m still better then youll ever be at wow stay mad
[3:53:59] wavecadet: it pairs nice with the lofi
[3:54:08] ZombieQueenElizabeth: no boss kill, clip is on twitter
[3:54:08] DaProfit: had 2 tornados touch down a mile from me in illinois last night
[3:54:09] trashcanff: @adam90k boomer
[3:54:10] estepitupp: Im in Tempe and the sky is clear lol must be nice
[3:54:11] thrushmaster69: Mages shouldn’t be able to heal bro it’s DESTRUCTION MAGIC
[3:54:12] imbaman87: do you go to ironforge gym too?
[3:54:19] adam90k: @trashcanff at a 20 yr old game? you realize what youre saying? go outside
[3:54:22] Peschke9: im jealous i iwsh it was raining
[3:54:25] English_Uk: @Mahca_ never noticed that. is it documented somewhere?
[3:54:28] Dingid: how dare you cover up the beautiful gnomeragan music of random sounds and effects
[3:54:29] Dr0ddy: How has the baby been doing?
[3:54:31] trashcanff: @adam90k ur mad stay bad
[3:54:36] Dreamzyi: @thrushmaster69 Thats warlock
[3:54:39] TerrortheToast: if you have the 3/3 set from the irradiated cloth armor you get a green glow around you - maybe he hast to suck this person?
[3:54:42] Eggzactly54: @Xaryu im eating a banana and looking right at you and chat. i thought you should know
[3:54:43] deniaL94: is the music from youtube?
[3:54:45] cykoblast: wat dropped off second boss
[3:54:48] oTrentx: U good g? LUL @trashcanff
[3:54:49] JukezZA: @Xaryu what if everytime he charge kills someone on the altar it damages him because of a blood sacrifice
[3:54:49] TEEEEmac: yes
[3:54:49] lyrickuhui: no
[3:54:49] adam90k: @trashcanff i bet 100% i am better than you at life and at wow. no question.
[3:54:50] Melkor_Active: Xes
[3:54:51] adam_brisbane: no
[3:54:52] mageguy8: no
[3:54:54] MKDarker: you need to play the event, that's it.
[3:54:54] mctwist__: Its possible
[3:54:54] ZombieQueenElizabeth: no
[3:54:56] Thejacob250: Would make sense
[3:54:56] mysherryamour: So kill a bunch of horde first before going for boss
[3:54:56] coastcontraog: sounds good
[3:54:56] beastleberry: chat is usually chill. wtf is going on today?
[3:54:56] limburgse: sounds logic
[3:54:56] Emil129c: no
[3:54:56] choppeddx: ano
[3:54:57] xbabyfirefly: yep
[3:54:57] 13brill: Logical! and makes sense so everyone can turn on him
[3:54:57] Witality: worth a try
[3:54:57] Tzuyami: i think it is more blood stack more dmg
[3:54:58] stnicholasss: ehhh maybe
[3:54:58] BierLaden: no
[3:55:00] A1K_GAMING: NO
[3:55:00] elinaip: could be
[3:55:00] jandoodle2: something with the blood makes sense y
[3:55:00] bpwryl: no
[3:55:00] Thiccnuggie: that's a leap tbh
[3:55:01] chrislu18: yes it is
[3:55:01] giftgreen247: POLL
[3:55:03] katiecat997: Yes
[3:55:04] dieseltacotv: worth a try
[3:55:04] Mahca_: @english_uk not sure if there’s a post but just something I’ve seen
[3:55:08] mageguy8: something else elisBall
[3:55:09] grovel232: you probably dont opt out
[3:55:10] mysherryamour: Might as well try it, kill horde first before going for boss
[3:55:11] fartguyl: wouldnt he want blood
[3:55:11] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: blood could reduce the healing @Xaryu
[3:55:11] Diddly_dope: think u have to be in event no large groups
[3:55:11] lyrickuhui: Just because its a no doesnt mean someone else has the answer
[3:55:12] shadowthehedgehog97: its nothing because blizzard didnt mean for it to be killed im sure
[3:55:14] choppeddx: idk :)
[3:55:14] Dr0ddy: I would assume turning in Blood to the Blood Loa would make him stronger
[3:55:15] Overdue_Cake: Y
[3:55:15] NelsonGamingShow: discover it bro
[3:55:15] SpaceCowboy0811: It's gotta be
[3:55:15] 13brill: WHOLE LAYER TURNS ON HIM, STAND TOGETHER
[3:55:16] fartguyl: hes the blood loa
[3:55:16] Thiccnuggie: we can try but its a leap
[3:55:17] clee0724: its the only thing that seems logical tbh
[3:55:17] TEEEEmac: maybe he takes blood instead of healing
[3:55:18] xbabyfirefly: ofc it wouldnt make sense if u could kill being opted out of the event lol
[3:55:18] Reaperz_kinetic: anybody saying yes or no is kinda dumb
[3:55:19] limburgse: dont go in raidgroup i think
[3:55:20] jbeemerks: Zg island
[3:55:20] alrik_plays: Makes sense, the blood god that feasts on blood, gets less health from you when you carry the blood of others (of which he can feast aswell)
[3:55:21] Merkkinz: isn't turning the blood into copper called offering or something
[3:55:21] askinforit: did y’all get it???
[3:55:23] trashcanff: @adam90k clearly hit a sore spot for u to @ me. get a life
[3:55:23] TurtleHoptv: logically you would think he heals more from it haha
[3:55:23] SlapdickWoWplayer: There's no way you can get that many people to be opted in for the event and they not just start killing each other
[3:55:24] lyrickuhui: hes unkillable. the 50% was a fluke
[3:55:24] BergEsquire: Sardaco's most recent strat has the most potential
[3:55:25] EXiTxi: I personally just dont think hes killable yet.
[3:55:27] mysherryamour: Wow, this certainly is a season of discovery
[3:55:28] MsStonedGames: sacrifice your blood
[3:55:31] Outright_K: Its just like in that one Dungeon from BfA i think it was. 'The Princess'
[3:55:32] Sgt_TBag: what if the blood you turn in is what he heals from? morfShrug
[3:55:32] Reaperz_kinetic: @shadowthehedgehog97 this is wrong… the devs literally said people should try to kill it
[3:55:37] Eggzactly54: did you AG1 before the loa?
[3:55:37] jbeemerks: probably has to do with bloods
[3:55:38] xbabyfirefly: ofc it only makes sense that u can only kill him when u are opted into the event
[3:55:39] thrushmaster69: mages shouldn’t be able to heal anyway it’s just wrong
[3:55:40] SpaceCowboy0811: It's gonna be a bloodbath
[3:55:44] Turkeypitz: according to buffs - he leeches from enemies following blood drive - its unstoppable - unless the blood drive can be avoided?
[3:55:45] adam90k: @trashcanff just wanted you to know youre a loser. thats it
[3:55:45] Thiccnuggie: oh right i forgor the implications of being in raid in blood moon
[3:55:45] Puunnn: Puunnn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:55:46] b1azzuris: no
[3:55:46] windatar: Easy way to check have everyone get blood and keep it and then attack the god together.
[3:55:47] bpwryl: @xaryu I think you’re overanalysing the boss. His spell heals based on the amount of people around him. When he went low when he was inside the arena with most people on ledge. If whoever has aggro jumps down in arena when he is at stairs you should be able to keep him away from the big group?
[3:55:48] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: or your blood coins damage him when he kills you, could be why he suddenmly dropped 40% from an aoe attack
[3:55:50] Desolate_e36: seems like that dev gave you guys a clue
[3:55:58] Bigten119: It's gotta be like Hakkar, you need the boss to suck poisoned blood so he takes damage rather than heals. Need to be poisoned.
[3:56:06] Bearcause: l
[3:56:06] reklebin: someone needs to saceifice themselves to him every 30 sec
[3:56:07] shipy14: what about the new radiation bombs? let people get hit then die to him, hakkar effect
[3:56:08] taylorsdank: blood for the blood loa i think
[3:56:09] ShadowPriestFreshy: You donated your own blood by dying.  That's why you were thanked.  You may need to collect blood continually.
[3:56:10] etremis: what realm is this?
[3:56:10] Bearcause: GoldPLZ
[3:56:10] tala____: blood for the blood god
[3:56:12] mysherryamour: blood for blood loa = have blood when killing him?
[3:56:12] oTrentx: Blood for the blood loa
[3:56:12] coastcontraog: the blood i think
[3:56:14] TerrortheToast: if you have the 3/3 set from the irradiated cloth armor you get a green glow around you - maybe he hast to suck this person?
[3:56:18] shadowthehedgehog97: he just wrote a ttroll message
[3:56:21] naomgoat: id try to sacrifice Payo, if that fails try again
[3:56:24] jackpepsimba: lmao doubt it was a clue
[3:56:24] YazzLivee: @Xaryu i imagine instead of health he drains he drains your blood stacks
[3:56:27] Gryphaaa: You dont even kill the boss you bring him enough blood
[3:56:27] ketchgg: I really think its just needing to have blood
[3:56:32] ziggler_: they were dying constantly
[3:56:32] taylorsdank: @andypandynz always hatin -.-
[3:56:35] trashcanff: @adam90k cool, glad that made ur day DansGame
[3:56:35] SpaceCowboy0811: Yeah sacrifice Payo
[3:56:36] csouthy: He says "Having fun yet?" I think we need to have fun while playing guys
[3:56:36] mattynuts: he had over 2.5k HKs wdym lol
[3:56:38] alrik_plays: @ketchgg Why
[3:56:41] YermGames: maybe his target got Di'd lol
[3:56:42] Reaperz_kinetic: @andypandynz you’re a weirdo bro nobody listening to you 😂
[3:56:42] MKDarker: @naomgoat 5Head
[3:56:44] mattynuts: people were dying more than every 30 seconds
[3:56:44] Fujinator: @Xaryu is he even meant to be killed?
[3:56:45] jackpepsimba: but dragging boss to Yojamba Isle is maybe the worst idea I've ever heard, please dont do that, there is no way thats the solution
[3:56:48] Emil129c: maybe he gets giga nerfed once he has consumed x amount of blood?
[3:56:52] dumpdeer: 255 stacks on the ears 255 blood
[3:56:53] Miraelia: he said "accepting BLOOD sacrifice", it's probs just using the blood honestly
[3:56:54] fmxhc: gm dropped him to 50% cause he knew you wont kill it. its not meant to be killed
[3:56:55] parsile: it might  be you need more than like 1k blood or something
[3:56:56] mattynuts: @Fujinator They're determined to find out
[3:56:57] TerrortheToast: if you have the 3/3 set from the irradiated cloth armor you get a green glow around you - maybe he hast to suck this person?
[3:56:59] JosieFS: going again at 3?
[3:57:01] Maehdras18: @Xaryu Aggrend said "Blood for the Blood Loa" while it's also a quote from the boss I think it's an on the nose hint
[3:57:02] jujujay_myalias: Maybe he has to kill an unbruised char on the alter and take their blood to deal damage to him? Something along those lines
[3:57:09] EXiTxi: Maybe you have to get him to stack blood, and atone him at the altar? @Xaryu
[3:57:11] pooman7913: maybe you have to die on the altars? sort of like a blood sacrifice?
[3:57:11] Turkeypitz: be outside of 45yards every 10 seconds?
[3:57:16] Zahack: has to do something with 255 blood / 255 ears
[3:57:19] pooman7913: maybe someone unbruised?
[3:57:20] Lifeles85: Hmm hmmMeeting
[3:57:23] cookie_jayy: bengal tiger not in the game
[3:57:25] mageguy8: @Xaryu elisBall maybe the new radiation bombs
[3:57:26] jstuwie: Kite him to the cave????
[3:57:27] tisoap: it cant be killed
[3:57:28] Dr0ddy: I camped the tiger cave for like a week and never saw the vendor so don't think it's there
[3:57:28] Mahca_: why would gm help kill if it’s not meant to be killed LUL nonsense
[3:57:28] moka_master: Gm was def dropping a hint
[3:57:29] luzid7: maybe not on this level
[3:57:30] romanisroamin: @xaryu I think the GM was trying to show you that u weren't doing the healing mechanic correctly. He 50% because he knew it didn't matter
[3:57:30] mattynuts: @cookie_jayy it's datamined
[3:57:31] mysherryamour: Maybe have max blood when fighting him? 255
[3:57:31] stnicholasss: must discover how to kill
[3:57:33] Wallscast: the bruising is for sure to do wit hit
[3:57:34] SghettiBoy: Is the Bengel tiger in the data or something? where is this coming from
[3:57:35] SghettiBoy: ohhh
[3:57:36] Atomsk__ZA: #seasonofdiscovery
[3:57:36] alrik_plays: They only nerfed the stacking dmg buff so his killing speed slows down towards the end of the event.
[3:57:36] Ayomeer: Not really.
[3:57:37] Reaperz_kinetic: @andypandynz you’re not very informed and that’s okay… it just means you should keep your opinions to yourself when you’re also going at someone 😂
[3:57:37] cykoblast: xaryu knows he got hinted
[3:57:40] Timmyjk: ? bengal tiger has been in the data files since 2005
[3:57:42] cookie_jayy: Oh didnt know that
[3:57:42] ChefJoe925: could be a later phase
[3:57:46] shadowthehedgehog97: didnt they tell u not to trust all datamining tho
[3:57:46] sullyman13: data mined doesnt mean it can be obtained
[3:57:46] beadle19s: ITS SOLD AT THE CNDOR IN THE CAVE
[3:57:46] czocze: someone here said he has a death audio file
[3:57:47] Szmirk: yeah probably not in this phase lol
[3:57:47] tala____: i mean bengal tiger was data mined in OG classic too lmao
[3:57:48] cykoblast: believe in xaryu
[3:57:49] jujujay_myalias: Maybe he has to kill an unbruised char on the alter and take their blood to deal damage to him? Something along those lines
[3:57:49] Melkor_Active: @xaryu Try stacking blood before engage
[3:57:51] oTrentx: Oh Andy got bopped LUL
[3:57:53] Velvuri: you get a bind on account 4 stam 4 str leather belt uuhghghhghhhh aaahhh
[3:57:53] Miraelia: the gm was giving hint i'm sure, just need to figure out what hint
[3:57:53] mattynuts: nah bruising is just a "I got molly wopped cosemetic debuff"
[3:57:55] MKDarker: it's only hoping and believing you do
[3:57:56] Nimbus723: not necessarily, they said a bunch of things can be datamined that might not actually be accessible
[3:57:58] dumpdeer: can we all kill each other to get 255 blood and go attack the boss?
[3:57:59] trashcanff: @andypandynz lol
[3:57:59] JackDiesel_: catJAM
[3:58:00] Diddly_dope: no large groups
[3:58:00] SlapdickWoWplayer: I think if you're bruised, you just dont get as much blood in the event
[3:58:02] YazzLivee: does drain blood stacks instead of health? @Xaryu if u have blood
[3:58:05] Melkor_Active: @xaryu when he droped to 50% lot of horde came in and turned in blood while boss was near altar
[3:58:06] limburgse: no raidgroup
[3:58:06] BigTimeSnack: BigTimeSnack subscribed with Prime. 
[3:58:06] kaleeb_uli: They nerfed it so you could play around it better durring the even
[3:58:06] beadle19s: SOLD AT VENDOR IN CAVE
[3:58:07] MKDarker: it's not that it will be the case if everybody believes a lot in it
[3:58:08] trashcanff: @andypandynz get rekt
[3:58:08] kallebalik: alliance and horde must do damage
[3:58:08] alexeycnt: bengal tiger it’s an old item that has been removed like back in 2006-2007
[3:58:08] choppeddx: no :)
[3:58:08] Emil129c: feed him x amount of blood and he gets nerfed
[3:58:10] sushileafbeats: gonna suck if he drops bengal tiger... cuz either its going to 1 person out of hundreds, or it goes to everyone and loses novely
[3:58:10] succaw: its gotta be something to dow ith the blood
[3:58:11] EbbandFlow_: Kite him to each Shrine
[3:58:11] Poolhaus: @Xaryu  devs made it clear that being in a raid group will be punishing. the drain heal doesnt hit people fighting near him normally, its gotta be draining more targets because of the large group
[3:58:13] sushileafbeats: novelty*
[3:58:14] Deraxuz: Does LoS work for the leech?
[3:58:14] Dr0ddy: Turning in blood makes him stronger?
[3:58:16] TerrortheToast: i think you have to wear the 3/3 irradiated set. you get a green glowing aura
[3:58:16] Mahca_: bruise just makes you lose more blood
[3:58:17] budmodeos: bengal tiger comes with level 50 raidboost in p4
[3:58:17] flash0187: slash tickle him!
[3:58:18] auuzib: It was data mined in 2005 and weve never seen it soo its really  50/50
[3:58:18] Bigten119: need poisoned blood
[3:58:18] nahitsmedical: it had a buff of ears like from hardcore
[3:58:19] clamshell24: what happens when you kill someone who is bruised
[3:58:19] DanPlaysChess: Maybe it's related to BFD. like you have to clearn Gnomer then clear bfd in 20 minutes, and Akumai jumps on a tiger and drops it
[3:58:20] carlosantonioar: if u have 255 blod cap, the boss wont heal from you
[3:58:21] hubbardhs: only a small group should be allowed near boss because of life drain
[3:58:21] swidey221: @xaryu need both horde and ally fighting it and spilling each others blood while fighting him
[3:58:23] jujujay_myalias: Maybe he has to kill an unbruised char on the alter and take their blood to deal damage to him? Something along those lines
[3:58:25] packtar: I would definitely watch the clip the other streaming has and analyze it
[3:58:25] 13brill: Everyone has to opt in, but choose to fight the boss instead of eachother
[3:58:25] Yeddamand: This might be overreaching, but what if warlocks and the likes who kan die from selfinflicted damage keep him 'satiated' and he wont charge?
[3:58:29] Eggzactly54: AG1 will do it
[3:58:29] Thiccnuggie: @Xaryu could be the exact opposite of what we wanna do. but what if we all logged out and saved the bruised debuff and eventually it did something. at like 100 stacks
[3:58:29] atinygoose: Corrupted blood somehow, because thematic
[3:58:36] Z_Luke: @xaryu I think you have to not be opted out. doesnt make sense that you should be able to kill the EVENT boss without being apart of thre EVENT.
[3:58:37] carlosantonioar: if u have 255 blod cap, the boss wont heal from you!
[3:58:37] cookie_jayy: Bengal tiger next twitch prime loot POGGERS
[3:58:37] aboringmac: Savix is going an investigative journey
[3:58:37] Miraelia: can you show the clip of when he dropped, anyone has link?
[3:58:38] Melkor_Active: @xaryu when he droped to 50% lot of horde came in and turned in blood while boss was near altar
[3:58:39] scheffman1: Peace is the answer.
[3:58:40] Turkeypitz: seems avoiding the leech is not possible - so the only alternative seems to be corrupting you blood to damage him?
[3:58:41] jbeemerks: could be something in ST next phase that unlocks how to kill him
[3:58:43] nonewstv: Just make a forum cry get him nerfed = 1shoted every time from it
[3:58:43] benjhamin99: Did the idea of kiting to all the alters get shot down? At each alter you might be able to aply a debuff and after you get all 4 you can kill
[3:58:44] RedMillz: @Xaryu I think its strange that you tried to fight the boss with the event turned off. I bet it needs to be turned on. Just makes sense
[3:58:46] TerrortheToast: i think you have to wear the 3/3 irradiated set. you get a green glowing aura
[3:58:51] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: blood tokens could reduce the healing he gets, or he takes damage if he kills someone with blood based on the amount @Xaryu
[3:58:53] Goobadoobadoob: Horde did keep flooding in and they were most likely not bruused
[3:58:56] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: blood tokens could reduce the healing he gets, or he takes damage if he kills someone with blood based on the amount. @Xaryu
[3:58:57] auuzib: OH GUIEZ It could be the start of the SoD item shop :D
[3:58:59] billybeer181920: protection potions could stop the leech effect, if it's a type of damage.
[3:59:01] braxEZze: @xaryu is there any mechanic with converting the coins? Or sacrificing them somehow?
[3:59:03] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: maybe blood tokens could reduce the healing he gets, or he takes damage if he kills someone with blood based on the amount @Xaryu
[3:59:03] moka_master: what was the massive stacks he had? there has to be something with the event that mitigates that/his heal
[3:59:03] naomgoat: duel it for gold
[3:59:03] Nlbbler: maybe you have to play the gnomer music to defeat him LUL
[3:59:05] taylorsdank: man having all the streamers come together for this is like the avengers lvl hype
[3:59:07] ketchgg: I think its super simple. Have stacks of blood or he will kill you and heal. Build up stacks of blood, then kill his ass
[3:59:07] Yeddamand: Or maybe a steady stream of turning in blood, the only time you guys actually turned blood in was when horde came to close to the altar probably
[3:59:08] Reaperz_kinetic: @terrorthetoast this actually might make sense
[3:59:10] Turkeypitz: kiting won't work cause he leeches from any enemy
[3:59:10] itkbutt3rs: 5head strat
[3:59:10] Exempt_Instinct: collect blood and donate it to the boss instead of the altars
[3:59:12] tiggilove: Prob have to be all groups of 5 focusing the boss
[3:59:17] azshare_: "A bruise, also called a contusion (pronounced: kun-TOO-zhen), happens when a part of the body is injured and blood from the damaged capillaries (small blood vessels) leaks out"    The debuff does sound like the answer
[3:59:20] monbe123: KEEP MORTAL STRIKE ON BOSS 🥳😝🥳😝
[3:59:21] zubaasa: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that... :D
[3:59:22] TerrortheToast: i think you have to wear the 3/3 irradiated set. you get a green glowing aura
[3:59:27] SpaceCowboy0811: I'm thinking if you have blood stacks the blood Leach doesn't take your HO and heal him @xaryu
[3:59:32] taylorsdank: that was what they first said!
[3:59:33] limburgse: JUP
[3:59:33] wavecadet: get blood first
[3:59:34] wavecadet: then opt out
[3:59:36] ketchgg: they dont WANT you to be in raids though...
[3:59:37] Thetacoeater007: but what about the altar
[3:59:38] themadfeltcher: You can still get bloods in raid groups, just hard
[3:59:40] ketchgg: they made that clear
[3:59:43] taylorsdank: "being in a raid group will punish you" remember
[3:59:45] miciahclay: Opt out removes your blood
[3:59:46] xbabyfirefly: would be weird if you could kill him being opted out of the event itself lol
[3:59:47] Thiccnuggie: yeah i realized the raid group thing is problematic
[3:59:48] Miraelia: sacrifice blood at altar
[3:59:49] EbbandFlow_: Why not just try stuff before deeming it wrong
[3:59:50] SpaceCowboy0811: You can still make a raid right?
[3:59:50] Genghish: Maybe if a 5man has full blood, the boss becomessuper ez
[3:59:52] mattynuts: @Xaryu opt in, no one does a group more than 5. and kill boss ?
[3:59:52] jujujay_myalias: Maybe he has to kill an unbruised char on the alter and take their blood to deal damage to him? Something along those lines
[3:59:53] 13brill: Everyone band together while opted in. defiance
[3:59:57] themadfeltcher: You can get bloods from PVE, raid group random mobs
[4:00:00] taylorsdank: "being in a raid group will punish you"
[4:00:00] Thetacoeater007: the altar seems like it should be a part of it
[4:00:04] tala____: aboid
[4:00:04] pmanfit91: You can get blood from one event, then save it for the next and opt out.
[4:00:05] ketchgg: no way they want you to opt out in order to kill him
[4:00:05] gryzard0: What happens if you go 40man without opting out?
[4:00:06] Tanthok: @Xaryu have a main raid that holds him and small group that jump in with blood. Main group is OPTED OUT
[4:00:07] eyepod: Aboid
[4:00:08] TerrortheToast: i think you have to wear the 3/3 irradiated set. you get a green glowing aura
[4:00:10] zubaasa: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that... :D
[4:00:11] moka_master: i mean he doesnt have a group tag? maybe he is meant to be free for all and all get loot who tag under the event?
[4:00:12] wavecadet: rip
[4:00:14] draethyst: it doesn’t seem right that you would have to opt out of the event to kill the boss that’s part of the event…. right?
[4:00:14] SghettiBoy: watch feet or get yeet
[4:00:16] raycon97: my theory is the streamers have no content and the boss doesnt drop anything lol
[4:00:16] RedMillz: Doesn't it feel weird to turn off the event before killing the boss that is FROM the event? @Xaryu
[4:00:22] ec48151: ec48151 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[4:00:25] mctwist__: @TerrortheToast Interesting idea, would that apply a debuff to hijm maybe?
[4:00:26] BigTimeSnack: What about the Alter where he spawns, instead of a different Alter has something to do with it?
[4:00:31] maxiliboys: Int buff
[4:00:32] mattynuts: @Xaryu carry over 255 blood to next event that's not a bad idea.
[4:00:32] jbeemerks: why would they make a boss for an event that you have to opt out of?
[4:00:32] Dabufy: yoyoyo
[4:00:33] Nawdy369: Half the raid in and half out.
[4:00:36] Miraelia: anyone got the exact gm sentence ?
[4:00:41] cykoblast: i think u cant opt out and takes lotta people not fightin n jus killing him
[4:00:43] budmodeos: @raycon97 lol
[4:00:45] Exempt_Instinct: yeah, as hes part of the event youd assume its linked to the event and to not opt out
[4:00:45] taylorsdank: are there other alters?
[4:00:54] mattynuts: @jbeemerks opting out just means you want to level and not deal with world pvp.
[4:00:59] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank yeah there are like 6
[4:01:02] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: he heals to full if he kills someone without blood perhaps @Xaryu
[4:01:08] DanPlaysChess: LUL
[4:01:11] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank we’ve already tossed the idea of taking him to each one around
[4:01:16] jeneraljelly: oof
[4:01:16] bojji900: the way u kill it u have less people and not 10 raids. 15 is enough
[4:01:18] mattynuts: what's the name of the blood debuff you get from the event?
[4:01:22] bushthebug: smitelet bro
[4:01:23] bushthebug: the sname
[4:01:24] Thiccnuggie: o7 his 99 parse
[4:01:25] bushthebug: snake
[4:01:28] taylorsdank: @Reaperz_kinetic true i feel like that would be nuts but could be it
[4:01:33] mazynga: twitch chat in the lair
[4:01:43] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: as long as everyone near the boss does over 100 dps he shouldnt heal to full every time
[4:01:53] thrushmaster69: fire mages are crazy good
[4:01:57] ballerdeluxe: UNUSED MBAR PROCS HURTING MY SOUL
[4:01:59] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank that would be wild but I mean so would having to kill him using bloods and bruises in 1000 5 man’s
[4:02:03] imbaman87: parse below 99 = kick? KEKW
[4:02:03] swidey221: you need to collude but fight him while free for all maybe? maybe his healing effect triggers off raid players or players not in event, that’s why blizz could’ve hinted initially that he’ll punish raids @xaryu
[4:02:06] mattynuts: @RSN_Thicc_Dylf ?? mob is hard to hit
[4:02:07] InsertYourseIf: GIGACHAD 99 parser
[4:02:07] wazza76: is the other mage arcane as well?
[4:02:08] Zerksyera: smitelet is dead , what a suprise
[4:02:09] shapebender: What if the sacrifice is a thing ... they don't want to kill hard-core so hunter pets?
[4:02:12] shamsoon: shamsoon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Kite him inside of ZG and bring him to Thekal, then kite both bosses on the bridge and kill both for mount
[4:02:13] Ervill1: lil dex, big di*k
[4:02:13] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: his max heal per person is 1070
[4:02:15] themadfeltcher: nuu my crowd pummeller
[4:02:15] taylorsdank: @Reaperz_kinetic exactly. i think devs purposely made it something nutty
[4:02:17] kjlor: smitelet dead LUL
[4:02:17] Miraelia: if someone attacks first and he's still red, means no raid groups just all solo attacking him could actually be key
[4:02:24] Thiccnuggie: the pummeler
[4:02:25] starkos7: lildex is daddy
[4:02:26] aroneatingsoup: fire mage
[4:02:29] billybeer181920: his pyro dmg is suss, crazy RNG
[4:02:31] oTrentx: Mucky fell off LUL
[4:02:31] JasperXIII: It's an event,  boss! I bet you can't opt out. I bet everyone has to work together
[4:02:32] gmazca: never seen the pummeler drop. nice
[4:02:34] taylorsdank: maybe bigger tha raid group the more he heals
[4:02:35] nachidru: @Xaryu What happened with the tiger event I missed it?
[4:02:37] MonkeyOverlord: Lildex showing how fire mage is #1 dps atm
[4:02:39] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank yeah for sure. which is dope I mean this is a lit community event. until we know what it is anything is on the table
[4:02:40] iinthebushes: give mace to pala
[4:02:45] iinthebushes: bis single target
[4:02:49] JackDiesel_: catJAM
[4:02:49] Coorslite619: why are you only rolling to 10
[4:02:51] chr47: Sadge never seen the mase drop
[4:02:51] hashtagstronger: he's not even 90+ LUL Kappa
[4:02:52] ebe____: can you link this lofi banger?
[4:02:53] nyjahwow: lildex 87 %
[4:02:54] Breakfist_: GIGACHAD
[4:02:56] Kiddbora: holy sht, this cozy music gave a whole new vibe to the channel, do it more @Xaryu
[4:02:59] SGRINGQ: what the music BTW ?
[4:03:02] dextuhx: LIL DEX ON TOP LOOK UP DEXTUH CLOWS
[4:03:04] Witality: KEKW
[4:03:05] espi: @ebe____ bro it takes 3 sec to find on youtube
[4:03:07] Knocktoff: HELLO
[4:03:07] TerrortheToast: i think you have to wear the 3/3 irradiated set. you get a green glowing aura
[4:03:19] Ayomeer: @Coorslite619 That's to distribute the grime-encruted thingies
[4:03:24] Jabdimus: WoW lofi on YT
[4:03:25] Ayomeer: each number is a raid member
[4:03:31] Coorslite619: @Ayomeer ahh
[4:03:35] hashtagstronger: @TerrortheToast just checked your chat history, you really believe in that KEKW
[4:03:38] Mahca_: did hunter get a bit nerf? used to be top dps
[4:03:39] bazookabtw: no AI @Xaryu DansGame

[4:04:10] packtar: any feedback on what he said in denomic from locks
[4:04:10] Mahca_: @turtlehoptv oh damn lol
[4:04:10] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank you don’t play do you?
[4:04:12] Ebeeyo: pummeler is ret bis
[4:04:14] Miraelia: for me two biggest hints are : he stays red even if someone else attacks + the blood sacrifices the gm mentioned
[4:04:15] quniceys: heal spec?
[4:04:22] ASS_MUFFIN: you still stream w/ mitch?
[4:04:25] zubaasa: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that... :D
[4:04:28] Dr0ddy: Sucks can only try every 3 hours
[4:04:34] Ervill1: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that...  :D
[4:04:40] hashtagstronger: @ASS_MUFFIN just google him and see whats up
[4:04:42] JoeBangles_: Ditch Jones
[4:04:47] Thiccnuggie: @Xaryu I wanna say i wasn't trying to shoot down your blood ideas, I was just being unnecessarily skeptical. I think we should try it
[4:04:48] carlosantonioar: do u think u guys got it next time?
[4:04:51] ASS_MUFFIN: aight
[4:04:52] taylorsdank: @Reaperz_kinetic barely :/ i work from home/have a 1 year old takes all my attention lol
[4:04:56] gomzomz: What if there's something in ZF? idk what  but I remember there's a quest to find hakkar related tablets in there
[4:04:57] stefanskijr: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that...  :D
[4:04:59] zubaasa: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that... :D
[4:04:59] Loodimus: I think just no group kill him
[4:05:00] cykoblast: for sure hes possible to kill
[4:05:01] shamsoon: @Xaryu Maybe you can stack bloods from a previous event to 255, then have a coordinated turn in while opted out of next event.
[4:05:02] d4brix: d4brix subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:05:06] waskaie: does the gear vendor sell anything odd w/ resists or something?
[4:05:13] carlosantonioar: do a pool see if people believie the boss will go down next attempet
[4:05:14] cxn_r: ZF is locked
[4:05:20] Bojanglez: !addons
[4:05:20] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[4:05:29] JoeBangles_: where is Ditch Jones? he finally go to rehab?
[4:05:34] Sharkiiiz: everyone is gonna have the stacking debuff if you guys are in raid while all getting blood
[4:05:35] rizcitron: Bring the boss to the secret cave where the new trinket tp you
[4:05:36] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank true you got your hands full
[4:05:38] SuperLost89: @Xaryu maybe turning in blood while the loa is near the altar damages him?
[4:05:38] iLtDan: @Xaryu bet he needs to go to every altar and turn in blood at each one?
[4:05:40] Twosickk: @xaryu you need to figure out his charge mechanic. is it charging the furthest away? or second threat? etc
[4:05:40] zubaasa: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that... :D
[4:05:41] gomzomz: @cxn_r ah i didn't know
[4:05:41] SuperLost89: @Xaryu maybe turning in blood while the loa is near the altar damages him??
[4:05:46] thriveindy: how’d the stv raid go?
[4:05:49] cookie_jayy: I feel like it is the altar
[4:05:53] JukezZA: @Xaryu it HAS to be the altar and the charge
[4:05:57] cookie_jayy: a Gm told me
[4:05:57] TerrortheToast: what if you have to have your blood "corrupted" by the "irradiated cloth set"  You have a green aura while wearing the set
[4:05:58] JukezZA: what if everytime he charge kills someone on the altar it damages him because of a blood sacrifice
[4:05:58] shapebender: Unless they are killing hard-core with sacrifice  ... maybe hunter pets
[4:05:58] sdotpuff: Wouldn't blood be good for him?
[4:05:58] Thiccnuggie: I liked the island idea
[4:05:59] Dr0ddy: Gotta be something with the Altars since he spawns at one
[4:05:59] stefanskijr: guys, i'm a friend of one of the GMs, he told me it has to do with an altar. When the boss is near it, it loses "size"... But he wouldn't tell me any more than that...  :D
[4:05:59] Heynong_Man_: !talents
[4:05:59] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[4:06:01] Sloppywet: @xaryu you gotta figure out how to take away his stacks
[4:06:02] mctwist__: Maybe it interacts with ZG ina  way?  Hakkar the blood god is there
[4:06:02] dutchsean: Holy spring?
[4:06:04] Genghish: Yessss
[4:06:05] Jaxxiom: naga shrine?
[4:06:06] bilbo_bohannans: ok ok hear me out. 5 altars in STV. Maybe each altar can only clear a certain amount of his ears. So what if you have to kite him around to the alters?
[4:06:07] Knocktoff: xarNerdge it makes me a bit nervous
[4:06:08] Zerksyera: KITE TO SW
[4:06:11] enoch87bear: YEP
[4:06:11] sushileafbeats: i think maybe you're supposed to spend some of the event getting ~200 blood, and then everyone smashes the boss
[4:06:15] ralphh1541: zandalari island
[4:06:15] xDooder: something happened to make him lose 40% life in seconds tho
[4:06:16] taylorsdank: yesssssssssssssssssss
[4:06:17] TEEEEmac: or the blood stacks heal him
[4:06:19] jvc723: I think you can’t be opted out of event
[4:06:19] Yson24: did you have bloods last event ??????
[4:06:20] cykoblast: yes
[4:06:21] OhZ0ne: You probably need to be opted into the event to probably even kill him. But I'm guessing the bloods you obtain during the event.
[4:06:21] grovel232: yesssssss
[4:06:21] Thiccnuggie: that does seem worth trying for sure
[4:06:22] cykoblast: it does
[4:06:22] bryn_dee: I would allllmost think it's the opposite and that giving blood to the loa alter heals him
[4:06:23] RedMillz: @Xaryu I really don't think you are suppossed to have to toggle the event off in order to kill him
[4:06:25] Loodimus: @bilbo_bohannans I like this theory
[4:06:29] SpaceCowboy0811: Nah, because that's expecting people to kite to a specific location in a giant FFA
[4:06:30] JasperXIII: It's an event boss. Has to do with the event. Bey you can't cheese it
[4:06:33] chr47: you will kill eachother with living flame, etc.
[4:06:35] Thiccnuggie: im just concerned about the obvious ramifications of that lmao
[4:06:37] ketchgg: there no way you kill the boss while opted out @Xaryu
[4:06:37] stnicholasss: do we all think the random 40% loss was a dev?
[4:06:38] moka_master: 100% the mechanic since he isnt group taggable
[4:06:38] JukezZA: the sacrafice is not giving your blood to the altar to kill the boss
[4:06:40] ShooterMcGavin827: who would get the loot then
[4:06:42] ShooterMcGavin827: group who tagged?
[4:06:43] Doimos89: then 1 guy will come opted out and heal him constantly :D
[4:06:44] Thiccnuggie: enemies from within and without
[4:06:44] gertrudesh_: what is your mage procs overlay? WA?
[4:06:44] Goosechaser101: what if everyone is supposed to have 0 blood, otherwise the blood heals him
[4:06:45] Thetacoeater007: get a bunch of groups all have 500 blood and then mob on boss
[4:06:47] moka_master: and have to be in the event
[4:06:47] tala____: and not aoe lmao
[4:06:49] mctwist__: @stnicholasss only way to explain it at the moment
[4:06:49] cykoblast: not kill each other
[4:06:49] lordextraordinary: Can only die in Arena
[4:06:51] InsertYourseIf: that's what we did lol
[4:06:51] Nimbus723: do you actually not get blood in a raid?
[4:06:52] TurtleHoptv: you all need 255 blood
[4:06:53] Genghish: Watch payo grief
[4:06:54] NotLarw: what if no one grouped  ?
[4:06:54] iinthebushes: rip layering tho
[4:06:58] jujujay_myalias: I just feel like he would have been seen takiing dmg at some point during the events
[4:07:00] Dr0ddy: Imagine only one mount drops lol
[4:07:00] L0stinthew00ds: what is the loot??
[4:07:01] cykoblast: horde and alllance has to work together
[4:07:01] Ayomeer: OR you get a ton of blood / coins
[4:07:01] sushileafbeats: maybe thats why they dont WANT you to form a raid? because it hurts the loa more? ;) @Xaryu
[4:07:01] mysherryamour: you HAVE to be in event and also have blood just to make sure
[4:07:01] Razzlee: Do one event where everyone stack blood to 255 and not turn in and the next event you bring all players with 255 blood @xaryu
[4:07:03] Osi7z: 69 blood each person
[4:07:06] lordextraordinary: Kill inside gurubashi arena
[4:07:08] grovel232: horde and ally together in one big death dance
[4:07:09] Sgt_TBag: maybe he heals off the blood stacks of the person he kills so you have to put them in the altar?
[4:07:11] stnicholasss: @mctwist__ yeah i dont see how else
[4:07:13] Maehdras18: @Xaryu maybe that's why he doesn't get tagged? Because you're meant to kill outside a raid
[4:07:13] adora_the_explora: is the mount that black saber?
[4:07:17] darkowitz1444: Blizz did say "There would be detriments to raid grouping"
[4:07:19] Thiccnuggie: true the layering...
[4:07:20] jbeemerks: loot is the same as ashenvale bosses
[4:07:21] OhZ0ne: You will need 255 bloods to prevent healing.
[4:07:21] ShooterMcGavin827: HAS to be something with the bloods
[4:07:21] chillyt616: @xaryu you can carry and turn in bloods after event. so maybe you can get some bloods and either carry to next event. or start with the event on gather a few and turn it off
[4:07:22] lyrickuhui: rip i bet 40k on no
[4:07:25] YamajiTV: are you gonna play to the elden ring expension
[4:07:25] ballerdeluxe: @Xaryu you need a /roll 10 macro my guy
[4:07:26] mackearns: thy did say raids are de-incentivized
[4:07:26] cykoblast: horde and alliance has to work together
[4:07:28] lyrickuhui: meant to be against u killin stv boss
[4:07:30] StayAwesome: I'm surprised by this point he doesn't have a /roll 1-10 macro
[4:07:35] darkmagi2: @Razzlee damn this is smart @Xaryu
[4:07:38] lyrickuhui: someone needs an item from a quest
[4:07:40] mctwist__: dont opt out, you may have to be participating in the event
[4:07:41] BrayMingo: dont have to opt out. you can hold your bloods to next event
[4:07:42] stefanblagojevic: who made that dwarf tavern remix hahah
[4:07:42] Udenwo: Do raid invites like last time, then everyone leaves the raids for 5 man groups 10 mins before vent
[4:07:43] Miraelia: what's the loa name ? imma delve into the lore
[4:07:51] SuperLost89: @Xaryu when people turned in their bloods at the altar, he lost a ton of hp
[4:07:57] L0stinthew00ds: @xaryu has anyone noticed if folks take less aoe dmg if they have LOTS of blood?
[4:08:05] darkowitz1444: I think tanking on the Altar and when he uses some ability it hurts hik
[4:08:07] packtar: were the horde turning in bloods when he went to 50%
[4:08:08] iamgabe69: @Miraelia Kha'damu
[4:08:10] Maehdras18: @Miraelia loa is Hakkar, boss is Kha'Damu
[4:08:12] Yson24: unless it has to do with an item crafted like The Onyxia scale cloak
[4:08:15] cookie_jayy: a GM
[4:08:16] stnicholasss: had to be a gm
[4:08:18] soyboywolk: ever think about getting a surface pro keyboard... the clicking is so distracting
[4:08:19] taylorsdank: nooo chanceee
[4:08:19] Kellvig: @Xaryu what are you rolling tomorrow in Solo self found? :)
[4:08:19] limburgse: a hug of a GM
[4:08:20] Mahca_: you don’t have to opt out just don’t turn in blood until next evey
[4:08:21] Zerksyera: melle turn in bloods and ranged attack boss
[4:08:22] lyrickuhui: GM was making sure an item worked
[4:08:24] Udenwo: GM for sure
[4:08:29] coastcontraog: 1 mil HIT
[4:08:30] ClinxyWow: is there a clip?

[4:08:36] limburgse: GameMaster
[4:08:37] cykoblast: there not gonna troll 1k people
[4:08:38] Udenwo: HE's letting us know we're getting close
[4:08:43] TheSward: what screenshot?
[4:08:44] cykoblast: he was jus watching
[4:08:44] Udenwo: to figuring it out
[4:08:46] PaperbackWritter: not a chatgpt gm Pog
[4:08:46] SlayerHoff: You could start a huge raid group to get all same layer then split into 5 mans
[4:08:47] packtar: there is a clip from one of the streamers
[4:08:48] Turkeypitz: check the vods - but did the boss get any buffs or debuffs from the alter?? maybe he needs to go to all 5?
[4:08:48] jbeemerks: GM would get fired if he interferes with gameplay on that many streams
[4:08:51] HoppsAlot: Could things like that be an answer to WoW longevity?
[4:08:54] TheBeerdedAssassin: maybe you only get the bruised debuff if you die without bloodstacks , so you get 200 bloodstacks so when u die it only drops a few bloods and you dont get bruised.
[4:09:02] th3hilk: he was saying you are half way there with your logic
[4:09:05] wowalbi: @jbeemerks no its season of discovery...
[4:09:07] hashtagstronger: alarm bot
[4:09:07] x_praxy_x: maybe its a troll boss. not meant to be killed meant to troll everyone tryna kill it.
[4:09:11] Mahca_: gm would not help kill
[4:09:12] Geawastaken: Maybe it was a GM showcasing how much he was healing to tell you that the arena wasn't the strat?
[4:09:12] ClinxyWow: is there a clip of the 50% thing?
[4:09:17] infuze27: the bruised debuff only makes it so you can’t body res
[4:09:19] PORRTERR: i havent seen the 360 spin in awhile
[4:09:22] taylorsdank: blizzard definitely wants to see it killed today which is awesome
[4:09:23] taylorsdank: im so stoked
[4:09:27] cykoblast: gm interference is not possible
[4:09:29] Linkan484: Any good drops so far? Just joined :)
[4:09:31] Am0n3r: @Xaryu HC SOD When?!
[4:09:35] Zacrilioth: do you think blizz will make sigil of innovation persist through death? right now its worthless for pvp
[4:09:37] limburgse: it was awesome! <3
[4:09:41] jbeemerks: the last gm employed by blizzard gets fired for helping kill boss on stream lol
[4:09:43] limburgse: cant wait till next event
[4:09:53] woiyar: sardaco mentioned something about the boss speaking in demonic, what was that about
[4:09:55] nopassi0n: did yall kill the boss?
[4:10:01] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank I mean they’re hinting at it so much it seems like they thought it would be killed a while ago 😂😂 which makes something like the bloods and altars seem like the best option
[4:10:02] mylittlehombre: have 2 raid groups one turning in bloods one killing boss. kite boss to one of the altars
[4:10:03] Osi7z: o7
[4:10:09] waskaie: its probably something easy considering the horde and alliance will be fighting over it

[4:10:27] SlapdickWoWplayer: there goes the boof
[4:10:28] Lekar624: pulling boss with no mana is ideal
[4:10:31] taylorsdank: @Reaperz_kinetic yeah i super agree. the time limit makes it so much crazier lol
[4:10:31] cykoblast: its a wipe
[4:10:32] mooarigato: For someone considering returning to wow to try SoD, what class would you recommend to get started?

[4:11:18] Reaperz_kinetic: @taylorsdank he was dying quick tho I mean if he wasn’t able to heal it’d be a one minute fight. which means there’s something else you gotta do to prepare for it imo
[4:11:21] mylittlehombre: innervate
[4:11:30] Zacrilioth: no mage armor lol
[4:11:41] fewwerw: MAGE ARMOR
[4:11:42] adora_the_explora: PUT A ARMOR ON XAR

[4:36:23] espi: -50 DKP
[4:36:23] Am0n3r: thats my observation
[4:36:25] Ionfreeze: tank has to be closest to boss start of each phase.  and each phase is new threat too.
[4:36:25] shadowvypers: still a super fast run
[4:36:29] ButterTubb: kiting causes 70% threat modifier
[4:36:30] Thetacoeater007: Boss gets aggro lowered when flame thrower

[4:38:13] realandtruephobe: @Frizankbeast Seems like boss can't get tagged and is never grey
[4:38:18] mageguy8: elisBall blood leech requires "untapped target" so it might not drain life you if you're tapped somehow
[4:38:18] Nappycans: good point adam
[4:38:24] fewwerw: @sfflash the irridiated set

[4:38:56] Salomexxen: Is it one or 2 tries on STV boss now?
[4:38:58] shadowvypers: it says you dont lose bloods if the boss kills you so that must be the key
[4:38:59] WilesDS: why opt in
[4:39:00] limburgse: and no raidgroups i think
[4:39:02] WilesDS: whats the difference

[4:40:06] shadowvypers: you dont lose bloods if the boss kills you so must be the key
[4:40:07] HellaKopta: maybe that’s why they don’t want more layers haha so it’s easier for a bunch of 5mans to organize
[4:40:07] Am0n3r: it releases a balance patch on retail

[4:52:11] SilentWisco: @MadCaptainDuck baganator or something like that i believe
[4:52:24] cykoblast: why do u need to go early if ur not makin raid groups

[4:52:42] jstuwie: WEEE been thinking
[4:52:42] rampage_002: so you get more blood the closer to the boss you are definitely has something to do with stacks of blood
[4:52:43] toemaytoez: @zerozuckerl shobek
[4:52:45] miciahclay: @cykoblast raids to start for layers, then split
[4:52:47] limburgse: YEP
[4:52:54] SilentWisco: @Plokoon100 no attempt #2
[4:53:01] cykoblast: ahh
[4:53:05] auuzib: @miciahclay THIS IS SMART
[4:53:09] Yaboyskins: I just gave my twitch prime sub let me join ur raid group for STV PLEASE lol i whispered u
[4:53:21] iamgabe69: like the mechanic in zg
[4:53:22] shadowvypers: you dont lose bloods if the boss kills you so i think you are on the right track
[4:53:24] themadfeltcher: ARE YA WINNING SON?
[4:53:24] Purplexxityy: No raid means death
[4:53:25] 444xtina: but wouldn’t the bloods auto turn in???
[4:53:27] cykoblast: what happens if ur in raid and in the event
[4:53:32] ketchgg: @Xaryu spend teh first 5 mins killing eachother to farm bloods
[4:53:42] realandtruephobe: Get Bloods. Farm Boss. Ride Bengal Mount ... --> PRofit
[4:53:42] YzieGG: @Xaryu the 3 set maybe cause its poison
[4:53:46] sushileafbeats: @444xtina only if you touch an altar, not the loa
[4:53:59] Muckbot1: @mudkip4me Make sure to Bookmark the page you obsessive troglodyte
[4:54:08] Plokoon100: what if. the irritated set poisons him @xaryu
[4:54:08] testestkappa: ok xaryu enough of this cringe back to arena
[4:54:08] goatsiez: so where did the bengal mount rumor come from?
[4:54:17] fonthy: its hc?
[4:54:24] adam_brisbane: what about 1 raid group and the rest gain bloods
[4:54:25] Reaperz_kinetic: @goatsiez data mine so we know its in the game
[4:54:27] 444xtina: @sushileafbeats ohh okay because I thought the gm said to be by the altar
[4:54:27] iamgabe69: dont need heals anyways if close to the spirit healer
[4:54:28] notso9oodgamer: will leveling be faster next week. I heard someone talking about it I thought?
[4:54:31] damnitdann1: some dude told Sav that you gotta bring a shit load of DOT dmg- affy warlocks and hunters and whatnot
[4:54:32] espi: spend 1 minute killing each other to get SOME blood
[4:54:38] Reaperz_kinetic: @goatsiez we just dont know where from and the boss is the only thing that hasnt been killed yet
[4:54:41] Sgt_TBag: if you start killing griefers, it might confuse others since they'll think you're a griefer LUL
[4:54:42] SilentWisco: @notso9oodgamer 100% xp may 5th i read
[4:54:43] damnitdann1: and you can range his leech
[4:54:44] English_Uk: Too many will die
[4:54:44] miciahclay: @goatsiez Datamined changes to the mount's tool tip around the same time as the boss nerf
[4:54:44] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu what exactly did the GM say?
[4:54:45] lntuu: what i see this as is everyone getting over 5k coins
[4:54:46] InsertYourseIf: NODDERS
[4:54:48] goatsiez: @Reaperz_kinetic you have a link or anything?
[4:54:51] fonthy: is it hc?
[4:54:54] SpaceCowboy0811: soooo, how do we get everyone same layer?
[4:54:54] Piratuga: you do need to get bloods first though @Xaryu
[4:54:54] 4wardsjack: you mean yelling for people to kill horde didnt help?
[4:54:56] SilentWisco: @SilentWisco march sorry
[4:54:57] boulderanialator: @SilentWisco may? thought it was march
[4:54:59] Reaperz_kinetic: @goatsiez i mean he looked it up earlier
[4:55:05] etremis: what realm is this?
[4:55:06] OGstrudel: we need to figure out the layer problem @Xaryu
[4:55:09] skitna: one way to find out
[4:55:11] Reaperz_kinetic: @goatsiez idk where the link is tho
[4:55:11] Heln0k: that doesnt change if you opt in or out
[4:55:12] JukezZA: you still get the tag opted in
[4:55:13] iamgabe69: !server
[4:55:13] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[4:55:15] femto_fox: why don’t you make a team dedicated to farming the blood that are opted in and they just suicide farm blood to feed the boss ?
[4:55:18] goatsiez: @Reaperz_kinetic appreciate it boss
[4:55:18] Piratuga: you need to get bloods first @Xaryu you farm each other first?
[4:55:26] cykoblast: stay in raid group while in event
[4:55:29] AndoBotzz: bengala tiger inc
[4:55:32] notso9oodgamer: @silentwisco may 5th or march 5th?
[4:55:35] vejitas4: @xaryu read your dm in game
[4:55:36] SilentWisco: March
[4:55:39] cykoblast: u get a debuf
[4:55:41] SilentWisco: @notso9oodgamer sorry march
[4:55:41] SpaceCowboy0811: still make raids to get same layer @Xaryu
[4:55:45] Muckbot1: @mudkip4me Yeah, so i cant pump raids in WoW.... what do you do? Troll in twitch chat all day? Get a job weirdo
[4:55:48] iRambo96: Hey Chat, anyone know the price of Boots of Avoidance on Alliance Crusader Strike?
[4:55:49] notso9oodgamer: awesome
[4:55:51] miciahclay: True, could just farm your own teams first to get blood
[4:55:54] n3v3ts247: that shobek?
[4:55:55] Eggzactly54: madseason is on if you wanna get him to join yall @Xaryu
[4:56:07] SilentWisco: @notso9oodgamer They are upping the gold reward for quest when max leveled as well
[4:56:09] curv6: you cant fight him there if you want everyone to keep their blood.......
[4:56:12] sledmaul: @muckbot1 you parsed a 6 and have the epic gun? C’mon dog!
[4:56:19] fonthy: what server is this?
[4:56:19] InsertYourseIf: Hmm
[4:56:19] ipntheshower: @n3v3ts247 it's Shobek and Sardaco
[4:56:21] Reaperz_kinetic: @Muckbot1 youre literally doing the same thing back at him.. wouldnt getting a job weirdo apply to you too KEKW you also dont parse well
[4:56:22] tuna_sandw1ch: almost positive he needs to be by an alter
[4:56:26] TurtleHoptv: kek yeah get 500 monkeys to pathing kite
[4:56:26] tuna_sandw1ch: that just makes sense
[4:56:30] Muckbot1: @mudkip4me I said 6/6 to get in. You have your lunch break at Jimmy Johns? thats fun!
[4:56:31] Reaperz_kinetic: @Muckbot1 just chill youre losing the fight on all sides
[4:56:31] kb_h: he dosen't seem to have threat table
[4:56:31] curv6: Wouldnt everyone accidentally turn in their blood if you fight him there?
[4:56:34] Thiccnuggie: he was clapping me in the stands
[4:56:38] Thiccnuggie: from the floor
[4:56:40] femto_fox: exactly yea , have a team feeding kills to each other to collect bloods
[4:56:45] hubbardhs: trolls taunt tho
[4:56:46] Nize2: i think he has a higher hitbox than ppl think lol
[4:56:46] Zacrilioth: if you cant make raids layering is gonna screw you over
[4:56:48] Piratuga: with blood strat you need to get bloods first @Xaryu you have to kill each other first?
[4:56:48] booddhi: he will lose aggro
[4:56:48] trevakanoosh: What bag addon does he have?
[4:56:48] Daddycool_B: No
[4:56:50] curv6: Wouldnt everyone accidentally turn in their blood if you fight him there? xaryu
[4:56:53] Daddycool_B: No one can handle one Hit
[4:56:56] kirk_hunts: Keep the players out of the raid
[4:56:58] kokoMcgogo: A cheese mechanic like that doesnt sound intended by blizzard so your first idea sounds better
[4:56:58] Muckbot1: @mudkip4me Youre not 40....
[4:57:01] kirk_hunts: and have a tank tauntingf
[4:57:03] Sillychops: can you target dummy spam?
[4:57:07] hitchenstv: @Daddycool_B I've eaten a hit as spriest, dispersed
[4:57:13] tacoking011: Need a priest in every group
[4:57:16] kickflipy: @Xaryu was that the GM that killed you?
[4:57:18] Reaperz_kinetic: @Daddycool_B nah you actually can
[4:57:19] Daddycool_B: Only dispers yes
[4:57:19] occulis: yo boys i havent played phase 2 yet. hows shadow priest performing?
[4:57:20] SilentWisco: @trevakanoosh baganator
[4:57:25] taglinetv: That seems not worth at all... shouldnt have to kite like that if the blood strat works
[4:57:27] Trix_x: did they try turning in coins while the boss was on the alter?
[4:57:33] kb_h: opting out makes him kazzak
[4:57:34] Reaperz_kinetic: @Daddycool_B not only disperse a lot of people can tank the hits
[4:57:42] Acework: thats the smartest take
[4:57:45] wreck561: makes sense
[4:57:50] Zolshy89: COPIUM
[4:57:50] xbabyfirefly: trying to do the event boss while being opted out of the event makes no sense lol
[4:57:51] InsertYourseIf: NODDERS
[4:57:53] Emil129c: feed him enough blood and he becomes weak
[4:57:55] rampage_002: closer to boss =more blood so it has to be that
[4:57:58] Muckbot1: @taylorsdank  TAKING OUT THE TRASH....., W
[4:57:58] kokoMcgogo: spot on xar
[4:58:03] reallyeric: wait does the boss actually drop loot?
[4:58:04] kindaopmusic: makes scene from what the GM said too
[4:58:06] taglinetv: Yeah xaryu's idea is bis
[4:58:09] curv6: Xar you cant fight him at an altar if you want everyone to have blood....
[4:58:10] Pudgypantss: 5Head take that will end up being wrong KEKW
[4:58:10] bakerbaker019: did they kill it
[4:58:12] inhaledthc: Hey xaryu just finished gnomer i tried tankin on my rogue but i couldn't
[4:58:15] iinthebushes: maybe both horde and alliance need to fight together because nothing is stronger than the power of friendship
[4:58:17] miciahclay: Form raids for layers, split into 5, farm your own teams to stack blood, start killing boss
[4:58:23] toemaytoez: so the griefers won't get any blood and the boss heals forever Kappa
[4:58:31] Fujinator: @Xaryu do you get the bruised debuff if you have bloods? it feels like the bruised debuff is a thing too, otherwise theirs no reason to put that debuff up
[4:58:32] meathole7: @inhaledthc skill issue
[4:58:41] jstuwie: get up to like 100bloods then head to boss
[4:58:41] ShingaTV: this boss better have loot blizzard xD
[4:58:47] Nezzy243: @Pudgypantss 5Head they prob just made a giant boss that wasnt meant to be killed and drops nothing
[4:58:52] cykoblast: jus make raids
[4:58:58] rawlexdota: You should all wear the same hat so u know who ur ally or not or soemthing
[4:58:58] romanisroamin: I think you have to SACRIFICE YOUR BLOOD to do DMG. It would make sense that if you die to the boss with coins on you it would do something to debuff or do DMG to him
[4:58:59] cykoblast: and split before event
[4:59:01] reallyeric: streamer advantage!
[4:59:06] yapercaper: make raids for better layering
[4:59:07] Piratuga: with blood strat you need to get bloods first @Xaryu you have to kill each other first, how?
[4:59:10] voncline88: do u need 5 man groups?  why not raids
[4:59:13] yapercaper: then split ya
[4:59:15] RastislavConka: what blood god
[4:59:15] jstuwie: another GM troll whisper lol
[4:59:16] Genghish: Stay away from altars
[4:59:24] ketchgg: spend first 5 mins killing eachout xaryu
[4:59:26] shadowvypers: you dont lose bloods if the boss kills you
[4:59:29] BombDiggy: if i was horde and tagged it? i could still loot?
[4:59:35] RastislavConka: whati s blood god
[4:59:35] kokoMcgogo: True @Genghish - keep boss away from altar
[4:59:36] BombDiggy: @Xaryu
[4:59:53] TheCraigJr: you should inv people to your group to get on your layer @Xaryu
[5:00:01] olanka_: can u show talent plz?
[5:00:02] poonti51: but he spawns everywhere
[5:00:04] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Maybe he evades tho?
[5:00:05] Daddycool_B: No one can bring him there
[5:00:09] walton6beast: what if he doesnt spawn at the arena?
[5:00:13] bushthebug: is the closest stv fp for alli really duskwood?
[5:00:14] EXiTxi: Theres an altar at gurubashi, i think thats a sign.
[5:00:14] realandtruephobe: I mean the kiting is not the issue right? His heal has huge range. The healing is the mechanic to understand.
[5:00:20] koooosy: what about putting the whole raid in the tower at ZG
[5:00:21] ketchgg: i think you gusy are too worried about a cheese strat, just figure out how to do damage without him healing first
[5:00:21] itsagamerelax: well now the griefers know where the spot is :S
[5:00:26] mageguy8: @Xaryu blood leech requires "untapped target" so it might not drain life you if you've been attacked by another player as part of the event elisBall maybe
[5:00:40] SuaSponte: if he heals of people without blood, then a single person can just grief over and over
[5:00:41] Nize2: have we tried the silence thing tho
[5:00:43] StunningPaul: @xaryu he's not realising EVERYONE will accidentally turn in Bloods at arena on runback
[5:00:48] realandtruephobe: Exactly
[5:00:55] taglinetv: People gotta stop trying to think about kiting and cheesing
[5:00:56] tuna_sandw1ch: it has to have something to do with the alter..hes a blood god
[5:00:57] infuze27: what does he say in demonic?!?!
[5:00:57] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!!
[5:00:57] frostbeee: ssf today?
[5:01:05] sngtokos: whats the point of killing the boss?
[5:01:05] iamgabe69: invite
[5:01:06] voncline88: what about Bruised that very likely plays a part... why else code it in
[5:01:07] Rawrch: @frostbeee tomorrow
[5:01:09] Haematopodidae: shobek DansGame
[5:01:11] miciahclay: Play away from altars to not turn in blood!
[5:01:23] cykoblast: why not stay i raids n keep the debuff
[5:01:24] realandtruephobe: @miciahclay This is a good point.
[5:01:24] shadowvypers: Dont fight him near a loa
[5:01:24] Grocery7: AYO
[5:01:24] iamgabe69: gachiBASS
[5:01:25] InsertYourseIf: HUH
[5:01:26] espi: HUH
[5:01:27] DrJamesBuchamomile: Hakkar is the blood god, afterall

[5:01:34] Eggzactly54: remembere to opt in
[5:01:34] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!!
[5:01:34] petethemyth: reaching
[5:01:34] Smor7: gachiBASS
[5:01:34] Parametik: BIG SUCK
[5:01:34] chasingshadowsz: huh
[5:01:36] curv6: gachiBASS suck me blood god
[5:01:37] clee0724: HUH
[5:01:38] yung_jed: so are we turning off protection?
[5:01:43] chipchronly: but then all the other people near him are going to heal him who don’t have blood
[5:01:44] tala____: No way, thats too easy to grief
[5:01:52] miciahclay: @xaryu make sure to opt back in
[5:01:53] RastislavConka: @Xaryu  what is blood god
[5:01:57] shadowvypers: you dont lose bloods if boss kills you
[5:01:58] yaboiswagnaros: bruised IRL means blood is bad
[5:01:58] Genghish: Bruised heals him more
[5:02:00] 1cyveins: that's not true
[5:02:00] parsile: maybe its like 100 blood +
[5:02:01] Fai_z: can you remove the debuff by first aid?
[5:02:03] xbabyfirefly: bruised debuff is when hes already sucked you, so he cant suck you again
[5:02:04] trickjames2: you do
[5:02:06] Klups: OPT IN @Xaryu
[5:02:06] ZombieQueenElizabeth: Remeber to opt in for the event
[5:02:07] OZZIDA: flag for event
[5:02:07] chetterbancettv: 100% get bruised in normal
[5:02:08] ChristoxCrousT: @Xaryu you dont loose blood when u die to him
[5:02:09] FoleyGrail: you need topto back in
[5:02:10] taglinetv: dont forget to opt back in
[5:02:11] infuze27: bruised just makes it so you can’t body res
[5:02:14] Jabdimus: Maybe he heals off the bruised targets, and as long as you have blood on you -- he doesn't heal
[5:02:15] TodBobertson: WHAT LAYER?!
[5:02:15] Genghish: Irl bruise is blad blood said someone
[5:02:19] chobinhood_: I think bruise makes you less likely to be targeted by him, just so he doesnt kill you repeatedly @Xaryu
[5:02:28] TodBobertson: WHAT LAYER ?!
[5:02:34] mattygisme: What if being in the raid the heal did way more than intended
[5:02:37] baboonya: Be cool if the boss drops a piece of a map that's legendary.
[5:02:40] Reaperz_kinetic: @TodBobertson bruh chill lol we got time
[5:02:41] bobbuildsitt: Bruised probably increases heals. And makes bloods harder to accumulate
[5:02:45] budmodeos: they’re worried about Microsoft laying them off, not making an epic puzzle world boss. Wow token.
[5:02:48] tala____: Nah, people would rather grief streamers than get coins lmao
[5:02:52] Coorslite619: it'd be cool if you made sacrifices
[5:02:55] infuze27: guys bruised just makes it so you can’t body res
[5:03:00] cykoblast: makes sense
[5:03:02] stevi3: makes sense thematically too
[5:03:03] kokoMcgogo: I like you theory xar
[5:03:05] NotLarw: LOL
[5:03:06] JukezZA: AHHAHAHAHA

[5:03:14] Zolshy89: def COPIUM
[5:03:14] scottish_barsteward: Lol
[5:03:16] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!!
[5:03:16] Wew_lad_: my initial guess was horde and ally have to work together
[5:03:17] Psico_420: im with payo lol
[5:03:17] Dinomight3: no shot getting bloods will affect it
[5:03:21] S0LSTICEech0: then you need people on the horde side to also attack the boss
[5:03:22] Kersed805: i love that payo is a realist lol
[5:03:22] realandtruephobe: One thing im wondering is what happens with layers. Last time on same server but diferent layer the boss never left beach
[5:03:22] TodBobertson: WHAT LAYER ?! 󠀀
[5:03:23] Daddycool_B: 100% with payo
[5:03:28] reallyeric: its does have like 3 million health no way yall can kill it
[5:03:29] TodBobertson: WHAT LAYER IS THIS ON?!
[5:03:37] Nize2: yea then split it
[5:03:46] chipchronly: whole raid light of elune 10 sec nuke ez gg 😵‍💫
[5:03:55] Mico027: it'd be funny if they kill it and it drops nothing
[5:03:58] lyrickuhui: when they leave it will delayer them
[5:03:59] StunningPaul: Is he ever gonna realise you can't do Arena strat? People will turn in blood
[5:04:00] adam_brisbane: why not make it only healers
[5:04:08] booddhi: @Xaryu just make a full raid then kick everyone
[5:04:11] tuna_sandw1ch: still think payo needs to be given as a sacrifical offering
[5:04:14] zartorak: When is the next blood boss @xaryu?
[5:04:19] shadowvypers: you need bloods
[5:04:20] Knocktoff: ehh
[5:04:25] Nooshbag98: bigger dot
[5:04:26] tala____: that's not it, promise lmao
[5:04:32] realandtruephobe: @zartorak 40 mins
[5:04:34] rawlexdota: You dont get blood
[5:04:36] lukemeleney: ok so raid, but don't opt out
[5:04:39] Razzlee: debuff and can't get blood
[5:04:42] heyimtazz: why would having more blood make him heal less off blood Xaryu? Hakkar is a bout poisoning your blood
[5:04:49] Dhowkes: you get slowed very bad
[5:04:58] Hozitojones: u get slowed
[5:05:04] tala____: "not gonna hit eachother" lmao ok
[5:05:06] bilborto69: oh this is gonna go well xdd
[5:05:08] keweiy: dude you have nice content for real
[5:05:09] realandtruephobe: But people need to get bloods before farming boss
[5:05:14] pizzabudet1337: Fury of the Blood Loa The Blood Loa demands sport, not slaughter of the helpless! Leave your raid group or face his wrath! All stats and movement speed reduced by 5%.
[5:05:16] Muckbot1: @mudkip4me why you so scared???? LOL
[5:05:19] realandtruephobe: Idk if you need max
[5:05:21] keweiy: just randomly opened to this awesomeness
[5:05:21] mattygisme: Notice how you can hold bloods when the event ends
[5:05:21] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!!
[5:05:22] the_naes94: what if u farm in 1 event 255 bloods and after that at next event u take the buff?
[5:05:24] yellowgaiden: u only have 20 minutes
[5:05:25] Daddycool_B: Xaryu, i know what you guys are trying and i love the challenge spirit. But you just can't kill it.
[5:05:26] TokerTy420: id say 100??
[5:05:28] Dinomight3: no
[5:05:29] kb_h: sounds spicy and intended
[5:05:29] MrFreeEnergy: /pray boss because hakkar?
[5:05:29] NotLarw: true
[5:05:30] sushileafbeats: I say get around 100
[5:05:30] Loodimus: id imagine more bloods less heals
[5:05:33] Dinomight3: you can't get to -
[5:05:34] teejway__: need everyone to go pvp for 5-10 min and then fight so the ressing doesnt effect you
[5:05:34] Dinomight3: 0
[5:05:36] TokerTy420: you dont have enough time @Xaryu
[5:05:36] InsertYourseIf: LETS JUST KILL EACH OTHER TO FARM BLOODS
[5:05:38] miciahclay: Just trade with each other
[5:05:38] nyjahwow: boss have max 255 blood on him
[5:05:38] tala____: y'all are overcomplicating it
[5:05:39] Razzlee: try to get 100 bloods
[5:05:40] Nimbus723: way too hard to get max blood in time
[5:05:43] chancerofl: @Daddycool_B says who
[5:05:43] shadowvypers: you dont lose blood when boss kills you
[5:05:45] luzid7: 250 is max i think
[5:05:45] kb_h: sounds like fun
[5:05:45] nyjahwow: what if u need ful lstack of bloods
[5:05:46] RedFlea1: @Xaryu you can make a spot where everybody aoes and players that have bloods run in to die
[5:05:46] blazzedzz: I'd say just get some bloods
[5:05:46] shamsoon: @xaryu can you check what layer you are on?
[5:05:49] kokoMcgogo: just spend first 5-10 min getting blood
[5:05:50] Zacrilioth: @Xaryu btw, forming a raid you only get a debuff if YOU kill other players. attacking boss WONT GIVE YOU RAID DEBUFF
[5:05:53] Dinomight3: 1 blood will be the same as 250, it's the same debuff lol
[5:05:53] graziNNN: what layer?
[5:05:55] hutchyy917: getting max blood first doesn’t sound like the strat
[5:05:59] Gryphaaa: @Xaryu def dont go for max
[5:05:59] hollywoodz007: more bloods less suck?
[5:06:00] erakson: I think you need to do the opposite, everyone slaughters each other after tagging the boss and he eventually dies from damaging himself
[5:06:02] kb_h: I bet its either turn in, or go for the kill
[5:06:03] Muckbot1: @mudkip4me ignore me on all toons LOL youre pathetic <3
[5:06:10] shadowvypers: you only lose bloods when a player kills you
[5:06:14] Fai_z: you end up losing too much time, just do for some time, then try to kill
[5:06:15] bigtimerush_1989: @Muckbot1 WOAH
[5:06:16] sunguyyy: getting max bloods would be dumb big waste of time
[5:06:17] MrFreeEnergy: /pray boss dude
[5:06:19] ScovieJ: think from a Blizz dev perspective...they would never require everyone in the STV chaos to all have max bloods
[5:06:23] MrFreeEnergy: hakkar lore
[5:06:25] mattygisme: What if turning in stops the heal for a bit.
[5:06:28] Cluzza: how are you going to get into the altar without turning in the blood
[5:06:32] heyimtazz: why would having more blood make him heal less off blood Xaryu? Hakkar is a bout poisoning your blood 󠀀
[5:06:37] realandtruephobe: @MrFreeEnergy What is that supposed to do?
[5:06:38] 444xtina: the blood thing is prob a waste of time tbh
[5:06:40] RedFlea1: @Xaryu you can make a spot where everybody aoes and players that have bloods run in to die so everybody has bloods on
[5:06:46] Zacrilioth: @Xaryu btw, forming a raid you only get a debuff if YOU kill other players. attacking boss WONT GIVE YOU RAID DEBUFF
[5:06:47] Cluzza: in to arena*
[5:06:51] Himaru7: maybe dmg on him increases with blood stacks
[5:06:53] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!! Fight him away from altars?
[5:06:57] sushileafbeats: watch killing him gives everyone 1 gold coin
[5:06:58] blazzedzz: I think Xar is right
[5:06:59] cookie_jayy: WHAT LAYER
[5:07:01] skoobss: what layer are you on?
[5:07:02] bushthebug: you need a shaman AND a pally to both attack the boss
[5:07:04] MexredFeral: WHEN START NEXT EVENT?
[5:07:04] ChristoxCrousT: blizz watching all this and taking credit while they make up what to do with this
[5:07:06] WilesDS: what layerr
[5:07:09] graziNNN: any1 know the layer?
[5:07:16] bobbuildsitt: It makes sense, the devs want y'all to embrace the 5 man stuff
[5:07:17] 444xtina: the hint was about location nothing about groups
[5:07:18] booddhi: @Xaryu the altar at arena will lose blood
[5:07:20] ppdxd: what server is this guys
[5:07:22] ttvtracerg: HORDE GONNA FORM A RAID GROUP AND HEAL THE BOSS
[5:07:23] Cluzza: you have to walk past the altar when you enter the arena wouldnt that turn your blood in?
[5:07:31] EXiTxi: what layer is it?
[5:07:34] ttvtracerg: they’re forming
[5:07:40] aackee: is it killable?
[5:07:41] booddhi: @Xaryu the altar at arena will remove blood
[5:07:46] MrFreeEnergy: @whitewatersalvo hakkar lore blood god stuff
[5:07:46] bundi222: What if the Boss isnt at gurubashi?
[5:07:46] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!! Fight him away from altars?
[5:07:48] pizzabudet1337: Can't walk past altar in Arena without getting rid of bloods
[5:07:49] Hyperioz: @zacrilioth wrong u get it as soon as the event starts and ur in a raid
[5:07:49] mysherryamour: @ttvtracerg nah horde is trying to fight boss also
[5:07:52] mysherryamour: don't kill us
[5:07:55] Reaperz_kinetic: that would be lit
[5:07:57] RedFlea1: @Xaryu you can make a spot where everybody aoes and players that have bloods run in to die so everybody has bloods on ps: altar removes bloods right?
[5:07:58] lyrickuhui: its less lore
[5:07:59] Nize2: wat about the shitty gnomer items
[5:08:02] lyrickuhui: more what is around us now
[5:08:05] kickflipy: @Xaryu Did anyone translate his demon?
[5:08:06] shadowvypers: fight away from loas
[5:08:11] bhigg32: could the 4 digit number in his tool tip actually be ##, ## coordinates?
[5:08:13] sickal: what layer is he on
[5:08:13] xbabyfirefly: ur in no way supposed to kite him lol
[5:08:13] chobinhood_: radiation bombs from gnomer?
[5:08:16] booddhi: @Xaryu the altar at the arena will remove your blood
[5:08:18] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!! Fight him away from altars?
[5:08:19] Zacrilioth: @Hyperioz are you 100% sure? I'm looknig at info from reddit about the debuff
[5:08:23] chasingshadowsz: an empty cave with flying dicks
[5:08:25] ttvtracerg: altar in gurubashi don’t go close
[5:08:25] SavageSeb_: I think you guys just overthink it and blizzard didn´t even think of anything at all. Its just overtuned as always
[5:08:27] 1cyveins: the demon voice is just a side effect of a warlock debuff
[5:08:29] DvidTV: can you show talents?
[5:08:30] heyimtazz: he heals off blood though, it makes ssense to poison your blood somehow
[5:08:32] Thiccnuggie: yeah it does add up
[5:08:32] Grocery7: hes drinking their blood instead of yours
[5:08:34] swidey221: @xaryu if that’s the case it’s important to not fight near the altars at all
[5:08:48] BigTimeSnack: Remind people to opt back in maybe?
[5:08:48] Hyperioz: @zacrilioth my guild already tried it
[5:08:50] braxEZze: @xaryu , you can't be in Gurubashi! You lose your bloods??!! Fight him away from altars?
[5:08:50] EXiTxi: Blizzard listening in for ideas to roll out next patch. Streamers = game devs. Genious.
[5:08:50] bpwryl: @xaryu you can create a custom chat channel in game so everyone participating can communicate despite being all split up
[5:08:51] sickal: wha layer is he on
[5:08:52] booddhi: @Xaryu @Xaryu the altar at the arena will remove your bloodd
[5:08:52] shadowvypers: you dont lose bloods if boss kills you
[5:08:53] Cluzza: arena altar will take ur bloods
[5:08:55] ihymisery: The GM did say "The blood god accepts your offerings" while he was getting healed
[5:08:56] Seline88: He still damages you with blood, not sure if he heals or not
[5:08:57] 444xtina: the Gm said altar is important
[5:08:58] saveslol: people are definitely over thinking this. Has to be something to do with the blood.
[5:09:01] 444xtina: that cancels out the blood theory
[5:09:02] DvidTV: can you show talents?
[5:09:02] mylittlehombre: you actually may need 255 or max that would be tough
[5:09:04] ChefJoe925: gotta be careful around the alter
[5:09:05] TheBeerdedAssassin: so dont fight him near altars cuz then ppl turn in and have no bloods

[5:09:24] sullyman13: ban wave inc

[5:12:53] bryn_dee: Ok but.. nothing in sod is this complicated.. what makes us think they would put something in the game that people who don't coordinate with 5+ raid groups via twitch stream cannot obtain?... Anyone else think its just overthinking or am i just jelly I can't be there because I am at work?
[5:12:58] kb_h: or just one group gets lucky

If you dont want server to lag. Just stay in 1 place and press 1 spell without movement and you might be able to accomplish killing boss.

[6:16:34] iFreeze420: @spookystylo yeah he was only casting Living Bomb lol
[6:16:34] absolute3x: You need stable server to kill it, this was mighty close and I think a kill was probable without dc'ing issues and lag
[6:16:39] ALeotar: @xaryu think it has to do with the ears, i think he had 200 and than life went up maybe
[6:16:40] iRambo96: that was so sick

[6:17:26] hughjasses: you guys are silly it's def a ddos
[6:17:28] absolute3x: so many dps lost to disconecct so who knows, i think its probable that was a kill on a staable server
[6:17:29] vap33: need more DPS
[6:17:29] chipchronly: Dragging it somewhere makes no sense
[6:17:30] adam90k: you had that with consistent dps
[6:17:30] chipchronly: at all
[6:17:31] re1er: to get pvp
[6:17:32] DanRas08: Maybe it gets HP buff when it reaches max ears
[6:17:32] Dre_26: its not an areal thing
[6:17:35] Taxsvcs: what about turn bloods in at the phase at 20%?
[6:17:36] English_Uk: DID it Die?

[6:17:45] handovdoom666: what if you have to have no blood for the last 20%
[6:17:46] SkumbagPikachu: you are not supposed to kill it lol
[6:17:46] tala____: If mages werent AOE andys we'd be fine
[6:17:47] PaperbackWritter: I dont think it is dragging related
[6:17:47] kryfy: @Xaryu they originally said that the boss would be downed in the arena
[6:17:48] MightyCactus1: maybe bloods being turned in does something to make him stronger
[6:17:48] flanney0403: take him to an altar to drop his stacks?
[6:17:49] morfius09: its not meant to be killed and blizz intervened
[6:17:49] Kasemox: Everyone log out for 2 hours now KEKW
[6:17:49] peashooterpete: inb4 it dies and nothing drops lol
[6:17:50] greaterscrying: it's the ddos

[6:17:51] zerozuckerl: less living bombs from xar
[6:17:53] Melkor_Active: DIE LESS HEAL THE TANKS
[6:17:53] jimg3: the players griefing with aoe is the biggest problem imo
[6:17:54] Pacoona: wihtout DC;ing you kill that
[6:17:54] wilbbbur: Maybe they didn't think people would try to kill it so they didn't do anything to it and all of you are speculating on it, when it really doesn't do anything?
[6:17:57] re1er: @peashooterpete most likely outcome
[6:17:58] Kirnc: get rid of mages 100%
[6:17:59] iFreeze420: yeah less living bombs
[6:18:01] RubisNosetti: No living bomb, no living flame,

[6:18:06] king___slender: Sorry all you whiners were inconvenienced for a few mins for something really cool
[6:18:09] dbd994: blizzard ddos
[6:18:09] absolute3x: if you think about it, all the dc's that's very many dps lost and minutes wasted
[6:18:09] Tommyb_nyc_5: no1 else could tank it
[6:18:11] Seoken1: you guys are close, mix in 1 new strategy and it’s a kill @xaryu
[6:18:12] crazyt4c0: prob cant kill him when too many ppl die
[6:18:13] AusoRadio: @Xaryu 255 ears = hp buff
[6:18:13] TerrortheToast: maybe the GM thaught like: damn that seems too easy and added accidentally a 1 in front of the 3 million HP? xD
[6:18:13] adam90k: you would do more damage with less people
[6:18:14] dime_____: @king___slender a few mins lol
[6:18:15] HoshTFT: THANKS FOR THE 30 MINS OF LAG XARYU :)
[6:18:15] fngironman: get your ally dbags to stop griefing we had it
[6:18:15] tiggilove: Just keep away from the altar so ppl don't turn their coins in and he heals
[6:18:17] ShinuPK: HAHAHAHA
[6:18:17] megasen: so what's the takeaway?
[6:18:18] domsie: DUDE, what if he gets Life PER BLOOD ON PEOPLE??

[6:18:21] garzzyy: i mean why not
[6:18:22] Snipezillz: blizz dc them all cuz they cheesd it
[6:18:22] Tommyb_nyc_5: he didnt run at anyone else once the GM got einvolved
[6:18:23] R3v00: perhaps he gets a % Health at 20% health based on how many Ears he has
[6:18:24] ShinuPK: unboon for the kill Pog
[6:18:26] lightweaver70: the disconnects is what slowed all the damaged
[6:18:26] Seoken1: unboon n burn
[6:18:27] bobbuildsitt: Arena is stupid
[6:18:28] sal92mc06: Living flame server crashed too, its not your own server's problem.
[6:18:31] absolute3x: on a stable server i think that was a kill
[6:18:32] BeeMcG: the annoying mages aoeing also didnt help
[6:18:32] XL0N: EZ
[6:18:33] Moogrins: Is it possible that at 20% he gathers health from players in a certain radius? An anti zerg thing?
[6:18:35] spooky_zen: might be solar flair interrupting internet
[6:18:36] king___slender: @dime_____ 20 mins big baby

[6:18:56] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[6:18:56] whatcha_kno: I see it from both sides of view. yes it sucks that ppl are all clumping together to do this boss, and it ruining other ppl trying to level. but also servers should be able to handle
[6:18:58] lyrickuhui: GUYS GM HAS THE BUFF ON
[6:18:59] fgaudreau05: Atleast GM is level cap at 40 too lol
[6:19:00] crainiam: GM got healer aggro

[6:19:04] sloankets: @xaryu thanks for crashing the servers
[6:19:05] Mcmackle: maybe the DDOS gave him hp
[6:19:05] Deceasedcheeks: What's happening here? Why there's more people than the usual?

[6:19:17] empyreaNw0w: @Xaryu At 22% (looked at Savix stream) he changed HP from 1 second to the other. He had 255 ears the entire time at this point. GM changed his HP with .hp command
[6:19:18] yami_yugi_87: The tablet on the Isle says a name of an NPC. Based on lore that NPS is inside ZG. Maybe bring the boss to gates of ZG?
[6:19:22] muztho: alls that gm had to do was one atack and it was dead

[6:20:30] 0reversable: Xar could it be he didn't heal as much this time because his heal spell only heals him off of the target and their party members?
[6:20:30] kinkylolftw1: maybe u have to equip the new white weapons from SM to giga smash him? :P

[6:20:42] acturs: Xaryu At 22% (looked at Savix stream) he changed HP from 1 second to the other. He had 255 ears the entire time at this point. GM changed his HP with .hp command - I can link the clip
[6:20:44] Famewar: youll be worlds 20th by then

[6:21:26] Maxlefou147: DDOS confirmed its on bnet
[6:21:28] rizcitron: stack the blood before so you have 30 minutes to kill it
[6:21:28] SghettiBoy: its because khadamu doesnt drop anything lol
[6:21:29] Miraelia: i think something happened
[6:21:29] ScatManGo: maybe maxing out 255 blood, makes u do more damage
[6:21:29] DaProfit: theres a DDos message on bnet
[6:21:29] luckyhappyduck: getting the word out to grief you guys
[6:21:30] acturs: @udenwo write it so xaryu sees it

[6:21:35] uluwatu_: @tonesview4 there is no ddos lmao
[6:21:36] Zolshy89: They do that all the time in Race to World First
[6:21:36] absolute3x: dc;ing tanked your dps
[6:21:37] batchestspam: it happened exactly at 20% seems like a mechanic
[6:21:37] TrapAlt: There is a very high likelihood that boss is not meant to die and they dont know what happens when he dies, so they modified him
[6:21:37] purplewingedboa: I think the GM was giving a clue of how much it heals?
[6:21:39] eskimobootycall: they didnt you bozo
[6:21:39] woodgnomes: even call of duty is down now @Xaryu
[6:21:40] TheCraigJr: GM was at arena and ZG has to be something with them
[6:21:41] bluefatka: Shobek
[6:21:42] acturs: @knocktoff WORD
[6:21:43] Gi_Units: Go back and look at the video when he was at 14% the first time when he suddenly gained health to 20%
[6:21:44] heypancaks: gm cant mod the boss only dev team
[6:21:45] Ayomeer: I doubt regular GMs can change mobs. Would have to be a dev or smth
[6:21:46] Seoken1: He was 100% modifying the boss in live real time
[6:21:47] Pixiepantss: 100%
[6:21:50] wowitspayday: they do not wnat you to

[6:22:00] Tommyb_nyc_5: THEY WERE HELPING u
[6:22:02] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu WHAT IF, the GM somehow accidentally scaled the boss by BEING THERE
[6:22:03] absolute3x: why would a gm grief lol that's a conspiracy theory
[6:22:03] themadfeltcher: Can you only know the ACTUAL HP if people haven't killed it before? I thought addons showed it via knowledge from previous kills
[6:22:03] Tommyb_nyc_5: cuz ur streamer
[6:22:03] RubisNosetti: Helping because of DDOS
[6:22:03] iTyped: F i was on a zep :(
[6:22:04] Tommyb_nyc_5: lol
[6:22:05] taintmeister92: maybe you cheesed it and they didnt want you to kill it
[6:22:07] sabsab4: I doubt they would sabotage you
[6:22:08] Mister_Painter: boss was dying too quickly, increased health
[6:22:10] nickels396: it drops nothing haha that’s why they didn’t want it to die
[6:22:11] cykoblast: they where helping because of the lag
[6:22:12] monkatos_andy: ????? KEKL
[6:22:13] eskimobootycall: they are 100% not trying to help you cmon now
[6:22:13] keweiy: of course gm can change values. there are tools developed by the dev team
[6:22:14] rohmantv: LOL Wut
[6:22:15] rrissole: what is the blood thing? does having blood increase dps on boss?
[6:22:16] wihahz: maybe it was supposed to enrage
[6:22:16] Tommyb_nyc_5: GM didnt greif
[6:22:18] JaimzWoW: I think they helped to check it out, but did change his HP to make sure you guys don't kill it
[6:22:18] pipefull: 255 EAR BUFF IS BIG
[6:22:18] mrbooshiama: HELPING BECAUSE OF DDOS @Xaryu

[6:22:20] VagalHunter: That redit post said they had that happen too I think it's a mechanic
[6:22:20] Zerksyera: BNET down
[6:22:21] tala____: tell that to mages
[6:22:22] kinkylolftw1: @Xaryu What about maybe the new weapons from SM beats him somehow? like why else are they in the game? like legendary weapons on KT in TBC
[6:22:22] stnicholasss: they haven’t added loot to it
[6:22:22] wowitspayday: literally just lagging the world thats all ur doin
[6:22:23] kindaopmusic: people cant aoe
[6:22:24] Heln0k: can we have bloods from previous event and then join raid group for the next one and keep bloods?
[6:22:25] Wrenzoe: Maybe we aren't suppose to be able to kill the boss yet?
[6:22:26] monkatos_andy: @rohmantv KEKW
[6:22:26] empyreaNw0w: @Xaryu  I do
[6:22:26] jumpalottahigh: based
[6:22:26] kb_h: this happens with all broken encounters and mechanics
[6:22:29] hashg0dx: why would the gms try to help when they havent had gms in games for YEARS XD
[6:22:30] hashsnob: dont log out with your blood, it goes away
[6:22:31] lz_vie: I think it was a lot of the people griefing
[6:22:32] keweiy: it is a basic sql query
[6:22:33] InsertYourseIf: Susge GM
[6:22:34] eph_eph: blizz got ddos
[6:22:34] TacoDood: it was at 900 ears it went up

[6:22:36] hope_vr: 225 EAR BUFF
[6:22:36] Tommyb_nyc_5: GM spawned at 25%
[6:22:40] Bolt_: well, since our strimmer doesn't have an HP addon LOL
[6:22:40] jimg3: but players are griefing with aoe it will be so hard to kill it
[6:22:41] hashg0dx: GM deff getting fired lol
[6:22:45] Wrenzoe: which is why the gm spawn to increase his health?
[6:22:46] acturs: @udenwo clip inc they are on to it
[6:22:47] wyrmboi: @heln0k yep
[6:22:48] mjtown: it was definitely the fight that caused the lag-its immediately better now
[6:22:48] meguidokun: griefers are clearly a factor
[6:22:49] rokes92: yoooo brooo you cut the hair
[6:22:49] Maehdras18: @Xaryu what if it's based on the time remaining in the event?
[6:22:49] absolute3x: scroll back to the 20%ers
[6:22:49] ripwarlock2: bro 1000s
[6:22:50] Tommyb_nyc_5: DW we will have the horde readyy for u
[6:22:50] Shredmuffn: you lost to lag
[6:22:51] notmotts: @hashg0dx unlikely
[6:22:52] Varousek: Couldnt it just be a type of enrage ? @Xaryu
[6:22:52] Thiccnuggie: it was also near the 15 min mark
[6:22:54] lz_vie: like if you don't have that many mages just like killing everyone
[6:22:54] tala____: enrage phase having more HP than BASE? ok
[6:22:55] gnube: the GM was not there to help. that is for sure. so they were there to prevent *something*
[6:22:56] KosmicDevil_: at 20% i saw a thing that said "hakkar goes into a killing frenzy!"
[6:22:56] Miraelia: that smells more like mechanic than gm
[6:22:56] evanjamz: says DDOS on battlenet
[6:22:58] resume___: it was 22%
[6:23:00] RubisNosetti: 50% couldn't get on layer\
[6:23:02] GrifffTV: DDos?
[6:23:03] jandoodle2: it probably didnt scale enough with the amount of people so he mightve changed its hp Keepo
[6:23:07] monkatos_andy: Aware
[6:23:07] SkumbagPikachu: You are not supposed to kill him lol
[6:23:07] Taxsvcs: Do you think you turn in bloods at that phase?

[6:28:50] neodude24: Think about it, they just added they tiger why would they let it be so easy to drop of course they are messing with it live
[6:28:50] overlayguy_fan: In which state is Xaryu located?
[6:28:50] Miraelia: honestly i don't think gm intervened WHILE FIGHTING
[6:28:51] wileyecoyoted: lets break the servers again yayyyyyyy
[6:28:51] sdotpuff: He started with 3.4m KEKW
[6:28:52] raki379: HP scaling per player tagged?
[6:28:53] Sharkiiiz: remember that GM also appeared on ur guys first aattemp
[6:28:54] Speyto: no way that many ppl ccan kill without server lagging out
[6:28:55] csouthy: i think he has a mechanic that wasnt working as intended?
[6:28:55] Ryett: Did you have any SP or Melee hunters?
[6:28:56] Syloa: check logs for abilities
[6:28:57] Patricd1991: how many people do you guys think were there on the layer 9 raids x 40  450
[6:28:57] Bongaholic_27: the boss had no loot and you almost killed it so they had to slow you down
[6:28:57] absolute3x: Holy shmokes, you got a haircut
[6:28:58] SkumbagPikachu: @Xaryu They dont want you killing the boss is why they changed it lol
[6:29:00] sushileafbeats: @Xaryu I think the boss scales to people around him. And the GM showing up ACCIDENTALLY scaled him up, since GM is probably highhhh level.
[6:29:01] Larewt: Probably wants you to kill him a certain way and isn't meant to be burned like that @Xaryu
[6:29:02] HelluvaWrecks: maybe you drop blood stacks at 20
[6:29:04] mrthundercatx: Yall are gonna break the game again on SSF release

[6:29:04] Chewii_OP: boss used last stand lol
[6:29:05] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu do you not think this is just a P2 of the boss when it changes at the final 20%?
[6:29:06] jellymann: isn't it ssf tomorrow? @Xaryu
[6:29:07] absolute3x: Looking handsome
[6:29:08] PastryDeath: all the blizzard servers went down
[6:29:09] DarkTemp45: could the boss be meant to scale based on how many people attack him like in retail world bosses?
[6:29:10] madbullx: bobby sabotage
[6:29:10] meguidokun: we need no grifers
[6:29:11] tala____: replace the griefing mages with teasm players ok
[6:29:11] flugrman: there’s going to be more people
[6:29:11] hulkdieselx: you clowns crashed all the other servers too
[6:29:11] griefie01: Lag was from DDOS attacks @Xaryu
[6:29:11] wileyecoyoted: bruh the servers are still down but at least yall got 5 minutes of content XD
[6:29:12] neodude24: that was first try they just changed it that’s way to easy for the best mount in the game
[6:29:12] LueDawg: Oh so if he gets 255 ears it's GG '
[6:29:12] Wrenzoe: Yah lots of mage aoe troll
[6:29:12] StormshieldFaerlina: you need warriors to execute him at 20%
[6:29:13] largist_: this might be something intended to come back at lv60
[6:29:13] CIamzy: This is crazy
[6:29:13] baurblades: Xaryu I think the boss scales to people around him. And the GM showing up ACCIDENTALLY scaled him up, since GM is probably highhhh level.
[6:29:13] Miraelia: DDOS confirmed ?
[6:29:14] absolute3x: YES!
[6:29:15] auroris9: You were blasting aoe lol

[6:29:19] lucasfevi: u were doing AOE lmao
[6:29:20] lizardboiy: bro
[6:29:21] gangletronic: throw STV lumber at him
[6:29:21] hashg0dx: how are server gonna be stable when you get 1000 people on one layer?
[6:29:21] Manzelluz: make sure that bitch starsky isnt on
[6:29:21] 44_james_44: the blizzard client is having a ddoss
[6:29:23] PloppinTurdz: DDoS
[6:29:23] absolute3x: He knows! server fucked you
[6:29:23] superdupergrundy: this is lit
[6:29:23] sushileafbeats: I bet the GM accidentally scaled the boss up by being high level.
[6:29:23] mrthundercatx: You guys were the ddos lmfao
[6:29:24] limburgse: this was so much fun <3
[6:29:24] keweiy: maybe it still doesnt have the loot table yet as someone mentioned. gm didnt want experience to end on a sad note
[6:29:25] chr47: Xar was using living flame too LUL

[6:29:25] InsertYourseIf: I only started griefing cuz other people kept killing me
[6:29:25] iFreeze420: also you had 0 dps except for living bomb grief
[6:29:26] Domatonetv: at 20% he is buffed by his kills !
[6:29:27] Swapzz_: GM presence over scaled the boss HP
[6:29:27] jaysstwotime: the servers are actually getting ddos'd lol
[6:29:28] flugrman: there’s going to be more people no doubt
[6:29:29] wulfgar___: it makes sense with the gear buffs if this boss hasnt been changed since classic
[6:29:29] Slipfit: Servers were laggy because of you bro lol
[6:29:30] English_Uk: @jellymann SFF is dead before release
[6:29:30] draethyst: I think the health based on layer population makes sense. if that’s the case, maybe the ddos chaos caused a spike in layer population, and then a spike in boss hp?
[6:29:31] iplayhots: PagMan
[6:29:31] Tanov96: @Xaryu check eu in 15min to see his hp 󠀀
[6:29:31] monkatos_andy: ddos COPIUM gm COPIUM

[6:29:37] CrerisRs: @baurblades gm was lvl 40 and was getting one shot by the boss so they didnt have that much hp to begin with
[6:29:38] Spicynooodlee: Spicynooodlee subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:29:38] GreenLizzardx: maby it scale based on the amount of ppl in the layer
[6:29:38] LueDawg: @Xaryu Look at the 255 ears buff appear right after health boost

[6:29:43] Nize2: i think that gm tried to help after a dev tried fixing it, so different ppl
[6:29:44] tuskraiderwow: could not be 'planned'.  nothing triggered it that we can see nor does the mob show anything.
[6:29:44] kinkylolftw1: You are 400 people colluding to kill it? I just dont think blizzard wanted you to kill it like that, no way you are supposed to collude for the kill like that, IF the boss is even suposed to be killed. There must be another strategy, to kill him with way less people.
[6:29:45] Chiphazzord: they posted on the launcher they are being ddos
[6:29:46] Miraelia: buffed by kills or buffed by somethin
[6:29:47] GreenLizzardx: and it bugged out
[6:29:50] krome2dadome: that's just my warrior alt

[6:30:14] Bhimasena: It is so smoothly designed. you get used to his mechanics until he is 20% and then the real fight begins

[6:31:00] Pixiepantss: no way thats a mechanic
[6:31:01] IshiidaJK: Not a chance
[6:31:01] Kryptiiq: no way
[6:31:02] Fearsoldier: @Xaryu a DEV showed up to stop you not a GM.
[6:31:02] Incognymous: If it's unkillable why would the dm tank
[6:31:02] CuppaCoffeh: GM was there seeing if you were using an exploit
[6:31:03] budmodeos: GM saved blizzard
[6:31:03] s0rrybr0ther: 2 silver 55 copper
[6:31:03] RubisNosetti: did he get the hp buff at 255 kills?
[6:31:03] hashg0dx: nope
[6:31:03] swyftboi: can everyone still log in?
[6:31:03] GreenLizzardx: its not a mecanich
[6:31:04] nickels396: blizzard 1000000% changed the health there
[6:31:04] Larewt: I 100% think they intend you to do some kind of mechanic to kill the boss and didn't expect you to be able to burn it like that. So they increased the health to stop you from doing it through pure damage
[6:31:04] GARPAR: Nerdge
[6:31:04] marty_hayes: just got in servers may be back
[6:31:04] danielbanks: What mount are you talking about ?
[6:31:05] hope_vr: YEP
[6:31:05] rohmantv: u have to kill em 3 times again
[6:31:05] hashg0dx: you cant
[6:31:06] Nezzy243: no
[6:31:07] Nuvak1711: No
[6:31:07] madbullx: 360 no scope
[6:31:07] hashg0dx: lol
[6:31:07] BryanC614: dont forget the mechanic of DC every 15 seconds.
[6:31:08] realandtruephobe: Just do the math
[6:31:08] Stinkfyst: +heals
[6:31:08] sengip: not in1 4min
[6:31:09] Miraelia: @vindiee on the clip that was linked it shows
[6:31:09] DragoncakezZz: So no HC then?
[6:31:09] stayinallive: if it doesnt drop from the blood boss. where else would think it would come for
[6:31:09] slimeuruuu: i think thats the point of the health increase, to not be able to kill it with straight damage
[6:31:10] Taxsvcs: Do you think you turn in the bloods when he gets HP buff?
[6:31:10] SmugJerry: @Xaryu IT'S A MECHANIC, NOT TO BE BRUTE FORCED!!!!!!!!! KILLING IT OUTRIGHT IS BRUTE FORCING
[6:31:11] Patricd1991: @Xaryu all that matters is you got their attention. if there wasn't loot. that's changed and it's buffed healthwise
[6:31:11] DPTDave: without Dc's and griefers, yeah
[6:31:11] cheddabeze: brute force it
[6:31:11] baurblades: Xaryu I think the boss scales to people around him. And the GM showing up ACCIDENTALLY scaled him up, since GM is probably highhhh level.
[6:31:12] tala____: Not with the connection
[6:31:13] adumb25: if you find him early + less laag + everyone single target it could be possible
[6:31:13] GARPAR: monkaHmm
[6:31:13] cheddabeze: yes
[6:31:13] auroris9: There is prob a trick to weaken him
[6:31:14] PloppinTurdz: HALO it is!!!! good day to you sirs!
[6:31:14] michaelosborne1: no way
[6:31:14] xpume: ALL right EU LETS do THIS! 15 MIN!
[6:31:14] SmugJerry: YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING
[6:31:15] madflava123: without crash
[6:31:15] CIamzy: Blizz just taking the fun outta everything
[6:31:16] Tanov96: @Xaryu check eu in 15min to see his hp
[6:31:16] Carpenterhill: @xaryu   can you have blood from previous event and join a raid grp?
[6:31:17] wihahz: without DCs yes
[6:31:17] mr_friseur: with the boys tho?
[6:31:17] mandude42069: i dont think those numbers are real
[6:31:17] superrxl: well it was a insane fight tho :)
[6:31:17] budmodeos: Don’t trust blizzard
[6:31:17] sengip: not in 14min
[6:31:17] Frostlicious: YOU CAN
[6:31:17] garzzyy: if you boon
[6:31:18] Epilate: maybe there is a way to do MORE DAMAGE TO HIM IN THAT PHASE
[6:31:18] absolute3x: yes, you were on pace for 3% per minute but dc's ruined it
[6:31:18] bemyepoop: take forever lol
[6:31:19] jgarcia95az: thats not a mechanic
[6:31:19] PaperbackWritter: not in 30m
[6:31:19] Zanketsuk3n: we probably could if we didn't lag/dc
[6:31:19] panzmat: not with griefers
[6:31:20] Piratuga: more gear
[6:31:21] HunterericTV: without the ddos for sure
[6:31:21] Wrenzoe: yah no way
[6:31:21] sullyman13: maybe at lvl 60
[6:31:21] SurianSkyborn: we barely did 5 million that attempt
[6:31:21] DirtyDan1659: not with 25% of the peopel there killing everyone
[6:31:22] Frostlicious: UNBOON AND CONSUME
[6:31:22] caaarlmemaybe: @xaryu maybe you have to deny him the ears: if you have aggro kite as much as possible, if he gets too close people need to kill you so he doesnt get the kill
[6:31:22] bigcaptain8: u can infinetly respawn @Xaryu
[6:31:23] DirtyDan1659: and the DC
[6:31:24] donnjj: YES if you get more people and srevers dont crash
[6:31:24] the_naes94: the gm has the  event buff - thas a clue
[6:31:24] hitchenstv: 100dps 100players
[6:31:24] Markusdaffu: @Xaryu EU blood moon about to start go watch some EU streams to see how much HP it has
[6:31:25] sushileafbeats: I think GM was high level which scaled the boss accidentally. I mean they showed up same time. @Xaryu
[6:31:25] HilmKang: without the DDOS I think so. most people weren’t damaging bc of DCs
[6:31:26] DankestDingus: without trolls yes
[6:31:26] aseoun: he had the 255 buff long before 20%. you guys are blind lol
[6:31:26] tigerslap_ow: you're probably not supposed to kill him
[6:31:27] Kirnc: think we didnt start attacking until 3:10 ish
[6:31:27] shadowvypers: you’d have to be on him right away with no grifers
[6:31:27] pliley: disconnects was the problem IMO
[6:31:28] Adrenalinefl: battlenet is down
[6:31:29] wellrath: Not sure if memeing, it's obvious they dident want you to kill it
[6:31:30] morfius09: 0 griefers 0 lag yea
[6:31:30] Piratuga: lvl 50 or more gear4
[6:31:30] bugcatcher19: need mores raid groups
[6:31:30] mr_bahama: there is absolutely no shot this is designed to be killed, it would ruin the event moving forward.
[6:31:31] Miraelia: he says a sentence just at 20% feels like a mechanix @Xaryu
[6:31:32] SurianSkyborn: maybe we do 8 then
[6:31:32] realandtruephobe: the aoe griefers really slowed it down
[6:31:33] bsraider: he going to have the 67mil tomorrow
[6:31:33] SurianSkyborn: but 17m ?
[6:31:34] Actill: yall should make a raid
[6:31:34] Turkeypitz: you'll find out next event to see what the health is
[6:31:34] AxiomDK: How do you get him low?
[6:31:35] dalvasorsali: 17mn in 30 minutes how much dps? @xaryu
[6:31:35] Caljim: Starsky was griefing you all the time
[6:31:36] ddevillax: ragnaros has 2 mil life
[6:31:36] IRagexdaily: so why servers pooping out lol
[6:31:36] Po_Savage: yes u can if you all arent disconecting 20 times in 4 minutes lmao @Xaryu
[6:31:36] spookystylo: I kept getting aoed down
[6:31:37] SmugJerry: @Xaryu IT'S A MECHANIC, NOT TO BE BRUTE FORCED!!!!!!!!! KILLING IT OUTRIGHT IS BRUTE FORCING, YOU ARE MISSING SOMETHING
[6:31:37] absolute3x: you were chunking it after the health increase
[6:31:38] iFreeze420: cough cough Living Bomb cough cough
[6:31:38] Udenwo: 10K DPS
[6:31:38] vindiee: @Miraelia in game I saw a yellow text saying something about blood god
[6:31:39] s0rrybr0ther: grief
[6:31:39] n3v3ts247: not at level 40 maybe at 50 and 60
[6:31:39] Exempt_Instinct: @Xaryu if its not a mechanic theres nothing you can do, so assume it is and try and figure out what the mechanic might be
[6:31:39] CrerisRs: you would need like 3000 people to kill him in 30 mins
[6:31:42] MrYettii: Raidleading a group in retail when the servers went down. Can't imagine raidleading 500 people
[6:31:42] Chiphazzord: and the ddos doesnt help
[6:31:42] mandarinengtr: Killing him the wrong way. Or they didnt think people would actually do it and needed to fix a loot table for it happening
[6:31:43] myyrlidon: unless you had retail chaacters
[6:31:43] monkatos_andy: Aware
[6:31:43] Carpenterhill: @xaryu  can you have blood from previous event and join a raid grp?
[6:31:43] Zolshy89: Xaryu they do that all the time in race to world first, like if they are smashing a boss that is a wall boss they add hp. or vice versa
[6:31:44] j8sonx: if you start right away you might
[6:31:46] mitchowens: 100 people doing 100dps for a full 30 minutes would clear it
[6:31:47] BullzeyeWoW: Aoe scumbags...
[6:31:47] baurblades: Xaryu I think the boss scales to people around him. And the GM showing up ACCIDENTALLY scaled him up, since GM is probably highhhh level.
[6:31:48] hitchenstv: 9444 dps over 30 min
[6:31:48] Nezzy243: AGGREND TWEET
[6:31:48] s0rrybr0ther: grief will happen
[6:31:49] raki379: Maybe the HP was supposed to scale to the amount of tags, and blizz didn't expect 500 people to show up
[6:31:50] KIMLARS: I mean I dont think the boss would be able to heal without any ability being used. I mean if it would have been a mechanic it would have been some sort of spell or whatever.
[6:31:50] Udenwo: 10K DPS would kill it lol
[6:31:51] nickels396: half the people there were just aoeing and farming bloods @xaryu
[6:31:51] RubisNosetti: I think it's a phase
[6:31:52] Taxsvcs: Do you think you turn in the bloods when he gets HP buff?  Cheer100 Cheer100
[6:31:52] Lewbra: the health change didnt happen at 20%
[6:31:53] Dre_26: u would need 45k dps
[6:31:53] hashg0dx: @SmugJerry KEKW CLOWNGE

[6:31:57] Xottz: 250 people doing 31.5 DPS will kill it in 30 mins
[6:31:58] ellyger: What did he say?
[6:31:58] benjaminmathias: on 1% the health pool will go to 147M hp :D :D
[6:31:58] SecretSOS: take to arena
[6:31:59] AxiomDK: Can  someone link this clip?
[6:31:59] BeatthisGames: maybe if the raid rise is that big, but 10 people do about 170 in 3 minutes

[6:32:03] B1acknife: if there is a patch tomorrow when you log on maybe
[6:32:03] sushileafbeats: I think GM was high level which scaled the boss accidentally. I mean they showed up same time. @Xaryu D:

[6:32:13] Domatonetv: he is buffed by his kills , it prob meant to be smaller group
[6:32:13] RiK3R87: Is it his ears buff?  Did he have capped ears when he gained the HP
[6:32:14] wihahz: who does he give the ears to?
[6:32:14] Nytsongx: maybe he killed too many people?

[6:32:24] ellgthompson: i dont think you need to drag the boss around it would be a stupid idea considering he changes target over and over
[6:32:25] sushileafbeats: Boss was scaled accidentally because of high level GM
[6:32:25] 4F4Monteiro: maybe taking him out of STV OMG
[6:32:25] xJmoh: Mortal strike
[6:32:25] rohmantv: Dps check
[6:32:25] s0rrybr0ther: killing it inside the arena
[6:32:25] Spicynooodlee: We can do it
[6:32:26] themadfeltcher: you forgot to put dampen magic on everyone
[6:32:26] dmediifps: server down
[6:32:26] superrxl: the fight was insane tho

[6:32:28] Valencia_Pete: maybe its intended for 60 content and you drag him to zg
[6:32:29] Playonwordz: depot the blood at 20% @Xaryu
[6:32:30] Tommyb_nyc_5: HAVE TO KITE HIM TO THE ARENA

[6:32:31] Taxouney: kill him in the gurubashi arena
[6:32:31] massiveshade: there's also not a a thousand people hitting rag

[6:32:33] werdnaeagle: you need to detect magic the boss tomorrow so you can see his buffs
[6:32:33] MoastaJ: maybe you need to cash in bloods
[6:32:33] kiruz__: Mathematicly it is possible. 10 groups, with 40 ppls, each doing 150dps avg would do 108 MLN dmg in 30 min
[6:32:33] soulnobi: Take him to garbashi arena
[6:32:35] PhokingTV_: check his EARS TOTAL @Xaryu DID HE HIT 255 THEN BUFF?
[6:32:35] KIMLARS: I mean I dont think the boss would be able to heal without any ability being used. I mean if it would have been a mechanic it would have been some sort of spell or whatever.

[6:32:36] ddraggbagg: Risky, but could be the way
[6:32:37] mitchowens: 100 people at 100 dps would kill it in 28 minutes
[6:32:37] tala____: then he heals to full KEKW
[6:32:37] morfius09: stun him right before 20% so he doesnt enrage Kappa
[6:32:37] PhokingTV_: check his EARS TOTAL @Xaryu DID HE HIT 255 THEN BUFF? 󠀀
[6:32:37] rsandoval305: more curse od DOOM
[6:32:37] GreenLizzardx: if it was a mecanic it would not change the max hp from 14m to 67m
[6:32:37] timmys7f: @kinkylolftw1 The flavor text on the weapons all lead to "echo" locations for priest Pain Sup rune, which is hidden inside SM
[6:32:37] TheMercDeadpool: The mechanic is kill him in retail
[6:32:37] RealTy_Guy: at 10 mins left in event HP value increases
[6:32:38] ayesoh195: Maybe you have to drag him to the arena!!!
[6:32:38] CSmitty917: you have to kite him to all altars and then ZG for blood god.  Look at how they are laid out
[6:32:39] Anadaeos: Kite to stormwind
[6:32:39] kief770: Drag him to the water to wash off the blood hes gained
[6:32:39] Epilate: there must be a way to do MORE DAMAGE TO HIM ONCE HE GOES INTO HIGH HP
[6:32:39] obstata: thats a good idea tho
[6:32:40] monkatos_andy: kite to org
[6:32:40] absolute3x: i know this was a kill on a stable server, im 100
[6:32:41] Madmaxx777: gotta feed him payo and give him indigestion
[6:32:41] AxiomDK: Have you guys tried taking him to hakkar island north west? @Xaryu
[6:32:41] Saint_Vallion: DUMP BLOOD AT 20% OR FARM 250 BLOOD AND START THE BOSS
[6:32:41] WordOfJesus: Can I tame this boss on hunter???
[6:32:42] SgtPepperTTV: DETECT MAGIC HIM
[6:32:42] PhokingTV_: check his EARS TOTAL @Xaryu DID HE HIT 255 THEN BUFF?

[6:32:51] sushileafbeats: I think GM was high level which scaled the boss accidentally. I mean they showed up same time.
[6:32:51] adam90k: you dont need that many people
[6:32:51] RubisNosetti: at 20% he gets max hp based on his total kills?
[6:32:52] dalvasorsali: 37k dps needed
[6:32:52] JonSolod: @Xaryu each alter probably needs a certain amount of blood
[6:32:53] PhokingTV_: check his EARS TOTAL @Xaryu DID HE HIT 255 THEN BUFF?
[6:32:54] theawesomestshow: DDOS
[6:32:55] ayesoh195: Drag him to the arena!
[6:32:55] SavageSeb_: You should have checked though if he still heals up if you handed in ears as it wasn´t killable anymore
[6:32:56] s0rrybr0ther: INSIDE ARENA
[6:32:56] Spicynooodlee: I just think we should Stay together and not go Crazy to kill each other and focus the boss
[6:32:57] re1er: trolling
[6:32:58] EFFSIN: u need the sword of 1000 truths
[6:32:58] adumb25: maybe turning in bloods deals damage in phase 2
[6:32:58] SecretSOS: kite to arena 󠀀
[6:32:59] Kirnc: ooo kiting him to each altar gives him a buff
[6:33:00] Sakarith_: @oakleafresin already did that

[6:33:03] InsertYourseIf: Your living bomb is AOE @Xaryu LUL
[6:33:04] penny_lanee: @oakleafresin they did I believe
[6:33:04] Moogrins: The mechanic is possibly a life leech for players within range so he can't be zerged. But the better explanation is GM involvement
[6:33:05] realandtruephobe: I was melee and was getting shredded by aoe ers
[6:33:06] KIMLARS: I mean I dont think the boss would be able to heal without any ability being used. I mean if it would have been a mechanic it would have been some sort of spell or whatever
[6:33:06] tr0bs: living bomb ur killing ur team
[6:33:06] bigcaptain8: blizzard is saying they are experiencing a ddos attack @Xaryu

[6:33:08] mitchowens: you have way too many people
[6:33:09] adam90k: maybe the health scales based on the nearby people
[6:33:10] stayinallive: unboon before he hits 20%
[6:33:10] berrychronic: what if the blood god isnt meant to be killed yet
[6:33:10] CSmitty917: You have to take him to ZG for the blood god

[6:33:12] Cinna303: he can spawn around the zone, so if its a movement thing you either need a central location, or specific areas spread out thru zone (altars)
[6:33:14] mitchowens: need less people
[6:33:14] easyafff: maybe something with the bruised debuff
[6:33:14] StormshieldFaerlina: gurubashi arena
[6:33:14] monkatos_andy: @oakleafresin where do you think they should take him though?
[6:33:14] kamuriz: they buffed the HP so warriors could catch up on the meters @Xaryu
[6:33:16] cotaino79: what if is a mechanic like last stand from warriors, that inflates health for a small period of time
[6:33:16] absolute3x: have to remember, it's not just streamers dc'ing, whole bunch of people. so many dps lost
[6:33:16] chr47: Living bomb LUL
[6:33:16] jacksunson: I couldve killed you but i decided to be a good rogue
[6:33:16] mitchowens: only 100 or so
[6:33:18] rampage_002: why did he hit 50% elaier whatever that was is prolly what yall need to do

[6:33:19] Kryptiiq: we already took em there spammers
[6:33:19] Saint_Vallion: mages were trolling aswell with aoe
[6:33:19] Drgreenthumb2891: Maybe its a mechanic thats on a timer, how much time was left when his HP went up?

[6:33:19] Sakarith_: @oakleafresin u are cringe
[6:33:20] Patricd1991: giving blizz too much credit. no drop originally and that's why the GM intervened
[6:33:21] sushileafbeats: I think GM was high level which scaled the boss accidentally. I mean they showed up same time.
[6:33:22] miercoles_: jesus, they literally took him to the arena.
[6:33:22] bsraider: @PhokingTV_  thats exactly it
[6:33:23] RealitySuks: Mathematically you have to consider the variables which shows, not possible right now
[6:33:24] swidey221: @xaryu did his kills debuff go away when his health spiked??
[6:33:24] Exempt_Instinct: @Xaryu if its not a mechanic theres nothing you can do, so assume it is and try and figure out what the mechanic might be
[6:33:25] dllls_: killing people with living bomb lmao
[6:33:25] RedFlea1: Maybe drag him to  zg
[6:33:26] Thiccnuggie: yeah i was just kinda running as kitty burning energy and dc'd come back dead and repeat
[6:33:26] hitchenstv: @Xaryu If they don't want a kill, it will probs ave 67M in 3 hours. If it's back down we gucci tomorrow
[6:33:26] leagueoflouwtjie: you were being griefed by 1 warlock constantly
[6:33:27] erousagi: @Xaryu what about the actual goal is not to kill him at 20% but heal him to full 67 mil
[6:33:27] Valencia_Pete: your bombs were just killing melee LUL
[6:33:27] Carpenterhill: can you have blood from previous event and join a raid grp?
[6:33:28] dinghulberry: Maybe at 20% he gains hp for every blood a player has around him
[6:33:29] superrxl: was a insane fight
[6:33:29] Bhimasena: there was so many yellow numbers on that living bomb indeed KEKW

[6:33:35] Aeryn_Zemyra: Probly something you were meant to come back to at level 50/60
[6:33:36] wihahz: mind control cap him
[6:33:36] Fiitshaced: maybe a bit smaller of a group so the lag is less and everyone can actually get through a rotation
[6:33:37] Saint_Vallion: PepeLaugh
[6:33:38] deniaL94: great day great day
[6:33:39] dime_____: LOL
[6:33:39] krome2dadome: @Xaryu would need roughly 9500 total dps to kill the boss in 30 mins. so like 63 dps doing 150 dps. or 475 dps doing 20 dps lol...
[6:33:39] wavecadet: self found comes out late
[6:33:39] keweiy: if you bring him to echo isles it may heal from npcs right? they dont have debuff
[6:33:40] Taxouney: Kill him in the gurubashi arena
[6:33:40] chr47: Doing aoe on the boss where all the melee are is maybe not the best idea @xaryu?

[6:34:02] Baysick: the gm was lvl 40

[6:34:18] NawtyTyme: bagel tiger might be a epic mount and they dont want u getting it yet? @Xaryu
[6:34:18] Spicynooodlee: I think they did it

[6:34:25] andres_1123: why are you ok with ruining the game for everyone else?
[6:34:25] realandtruephobe: If they didn't want you to kill it why not just give it 67m to begin with?
[6:34:25] bushthebug: killing boss opens ZG
[6:34:26] churuby: the gm interaction prob messed it up
[6:34:27] TheYellowOfTheEgg: There was a GM at this fight?
[6:34:27] DreycoTW: gm was a bot
[6:34:27] CrerisRs: gm was going 100 to 0 every hit, just being immune, he didnt have much hp
[6:34:28] mitsankladan: after 20% boss didn’t regenerate his HP
[6:34:29] melvindorkus: theres no scaling in the game they said so it had to be manual or a mechanic
[6:34:29] ScatManGo: i dont think so. it happened like exactly at 20 percent. didnt it>

[6:34:30] vishu_tw: @Xaryu it would have dropped the gm's browsers history and didn't want you do find out
[6:34:30] Spicynooodlee: boss too OP
[6:34:30] InsertYourseIf: TRUE the boss took the invulnerability from him

[6:34:34] Phoenix3215: Too many variables

[6:34:35] Tommyb_nyc_5: thats such a cop out
[6:34:35] PhokingTV_: check his EARS TOTAL @Xaryu DID HE HIT 255 THEN BUFF? 󠀀

[6:34:39] MongoSecurity: Yeah I bet they buffed it
[6:34:40] Gi_Units: But it’s not gonna increase his base amount of health
[6:34:41] ddevillax: you need 11500dps in total to do 17 million hp in 25 minutes
[6:34:41] themadfeltcher: What if random people who opted out joined in and got killed?
[6:34:42] Camosurfer21: does boss heal or gain max hp and heal?

[6:34:48] KIMLARS: 100% GM buffed his HP, no player/mob can gain 14mil health without casting anything D:
[6:34:49] cotaino79: the gm didnt had blood
[6:34:49] rainha_wow: At 21% his health was multiplied by 21. That's weird
[6:34:49] brock_bahma: was it 20% or 21%?
[6:34:50] axantur12: @CrerisRs his buff says he absorbs fatal damage, not that hes immune to it
[6:34:50] PhokingTV_: ok
[6:34:51] Tommyb_nyc_5: i watched the whole thing there was no GM intereference
[6:34:53] HulkingPear: was gm tanking when he went up? or after?

[6:35:13] saprelec: Didn't the hp drop when you pulled (or gm pulled) the boss to the altar? Did  it drop his ears??
[6:35:16] spooky_zen: maybe the program would ahve crashed if he died so gm buffed it
[6:35:18] reteeh: what if gm was showed u what to do ? when bring him to altar - give bk blood
[6:35:18] CrerisRs: @axantur12 the fact that the boss was able to hit him for more than his entire health pool means that the gm definitely doesnt have much hp tho
[6:35:21] dizzypeezy: Xaryu missed it on stream but a second GM also popped up and tanked, named Brotherjohn
[6:35:23] re1er: huh
[6:35:24] mandude42069: The game dosn't sent health data like that
[6:35:24] ddevillax: you need at least 11500 dps in total to do 17 million hp in 25 minutes
[6:35:26] iFreeze420: 21 21 21
[6:35:27] ladyb0y420: issnt it obv, bring him to the ARENA at STV when hes at 20% @Xaryu
[6:35:29] re1er: maybe it's an enrage?
[6:35:29] Baconhole: Quick someone ask ChatGPT for the answers
[6:35:29] dalvasorsali: 80 dps * 500 players * 60 * 15 = doable
[6:35:32] mandude42069: it's addons trying to figure it out
[6:35:32] Bhimasena: They only gm interraction i saw was tagging it because the servers lagged
[6:35:32] deniaL94: @alrightyballmighty yes he was visible, buff was mouseovered by xaryu
[6:35:34] Gi_Units: weird
[6:35:35] ctrlbeesy: lmaooo
[6:35:36] NGianga: maybe last 20% you need to kill him in the arena?
[6:35:36] Xottz: that has to be a coincidence tho
[6:35:38] StormshieldFaerlina: AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count.
[6:35:38] Badbotqt: 10+9=21
[6:35:38] kindaopmusic: We need 21 Savage to get on his all to help us
[6:35:39] Genghish: 9 + 10
[6:35:40] Uzziah56: @xaryu have you tried taking him out of the zone or seeing what that does? Maybe he loses the blood hakkars blessing or something cuz its limited to STV
[6:35:43] Carpenterhill: can you have blood from previous event and join a raid grp?
[6:35:43] dualitylol: brotherjohn died, he wasnt a gm
[6:35:43] Sharkiiiz: i saw brother john aswell
[6:35:43] monkatos_andy: brother John KEKL
[6:35:44] Gamalimbo: I saw brotherjohn as well
[6:35:44] re1er: could be timing
[6:35:45] themadfeltcher: Nah I think it's probalby an intended mechanic
[6:35:45] LueDawg: He got 255 ears
[6:35:47] Nize2: anyone have a clip of brotherjohn
[6:35:48] axantur12: @CrerisRs if fatal damage is being absorbed, then his effective health pool is infinite
[6:35:51] Exempt_Instinct: @Xaryu if its not a mechanic theres nothing you can do, so assume it is and try and figure out what the mechanic might be
[6:35:51] Alfacor: Its in your vod @Xaryu I saw it here. BrotherJohn
[6:35:55] jettmknz: let’s say you guys kill boss and ashbringer drops :O
[6:35:56] Kickproof: Kha converted to numbers is 1181, the same spell id for regeneration
[6:35:56] nickels396: I think people are overthinking way too hard. some of these mechanics wouldn’t be achievable in an open world setting and blizzard knows this. I think they just added health cause they didn’t want it to die @xaryu
[6:35:56] CrerisRs: @saprelec neither dropped, he was still big when despawning
[6:35:56] GreenLizzardx: if it was a mecanic it would not change the max hp from 14m to 67m
[6:35:57] re1er: could be speed
[6:35:59] GoodGriffey: Maybe is a timing situation
[6:35:59] mighttx: brotherjohn is literally a 40 priest
[6:36:00] Sharkiiiz: someone get the clip of brother john, i know it was on xar's stream
[6:36:01] hashg0dx: funny that the health went up with the gm was present
[6:36:01] PMA_1: call josh @Xaryu
[6:36:02] Tommyb_nyc_5: AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. EXACTLY - NOT THE GM
[6:36:03] tuttskie: it looks like he consumed the ears
[6:36:04] saprelec: Didn't the hp drop when you pulled (or gm pulled) the boss to the altar? Did  it drop his ears??
[6:36:04] mighttx: check who list
[6:36:04] ddevillax: you need 11333dps in total to do 17 million hp in 25 minutes
[6:36:05] mitsankladan: what if everyone had 255 bloods and boss zero ears
[6:36:06] seangelma: brotherjohn wasnt a gm
[6:36:06] AndoBotzz: why thw gm then?
[6:36:10] FaluranTV: brotherjohn is a 40 horde priest lmao
[6:36:10] 13brill: 1 mil hp per 100 ears?
[6:36:10] Mestema17: does he say anything when his health increases?
[6:36:12] McNerdSauce: i personally think GM's didnt think anyone would get as far as yall did and they yoinked the HP
[6:36:13] sushileafbeats: was the 2nd GM 60?
[6:36:13] re1er: gotta go fast?
[6:36:18] AxelFromAustralia: definitely something to do with 21 savage, it’s obvious, and try playing some 21 next stream?
[6:36:18] tuttskie: he consumed the ears
[6:36:19] YaBoy_Lijah: what if you have to take him to entrace of ZG @Xaryu
[6:36:19] jakerose07: i was right next to brotherjohn he is an undead priest lol
[6:36:20] Pixiepantss: i have no idea
[6:36:22] Carpenterhill: @xaryu  can you have blood from previous event and join a raid grp?
[6:36:25] nonhealer: @Xaryu  you broke all classic serves........
[6:36:25] Uzziah56: @xaryu have you tried taking him out of the zone or seeing what that does? Maybe he loses the blood hakkars blessing or something cuz its limited to STV
[6:36:27] vaniteaDH: theres no mechanic that scales HP like that, they dont make wow bosses like that, if it was ment to happen he would heal
[6:36:30] 1osku: Bring him to ZG at the last phase. Hakkar is the blood god after all!!
[6:36:31] absolute3x: login screen dps isn't that good
[6:36:32] lukemeleney: I definitely don't think it's a location based mechanic, the boss spawning randomly and being basically untankable would make that impossible
[6:36:32] kirk_hunts: MORE HUNTERS
[6:36:34] britcoffins: @Xaryu This effort is destroying Hardcore. Hundreds of people have died due to the lag and mass DCs :/
[6:36:34] Tanov96: @Xaryu check eu in 10min to see his hp
[6:36:35] rampage_002: 20% turnin bloods
[6:36:35] fantasticodave: the tinfoil theory is wild LUL
[6:36:36] ImThatFella: I had to step out did you get him
[6:36:36] phinn_insertclass: anyone try using the soul prism thing from the box rep vendor yet?
[6:36:37] f4a_tony: It's not just 17Mil, he also heals its much harder than just 17 mil hp
[6:36:38] Badbotqt: maybe he gets hp increased after a certain amount of ears
[6:36:39] emagill97: wait til Friday, can get more people…
[6:36:42] PhokingTV_: 500 MELEE HUNTERs
[6:36:43] kirk_hunts: LITERALLY JUST MORE HUNTERs
[6:36:45] themadfeltcher: people are hitting 3-500 in raid, 11k dps isn't that hard, only like 30-40 people
[6:36:45] PhokingTV_: 500 MELEE HUNTERs IS THE ONLY WAY
[6:36:46] kirk_hunts: haha
[6:36:47] saprelec: Didn't the hp drop when you pulled (or gm pulled) the boss to the altar? Did  it drop his ears??
[6:36:48] neodude24: BLIZZARD DDOS
[6:36:48] pretty_cool_guy: that's only 100 dps for 100 people
[6:36:49] DPTDave: less griefers
[6:36:49] pigpowerful: 1 more boomie and you guys had it
[6:36:49] wrenched: brotherjohn is a player, I have seen him on the server several times
[6:36:50] kirk_hunts: No
[6:36:50] detourz28: @britcoffins DDoS bud
[6:36:52] pretty_cool_guy: to do 10k
[6:36:53] CyjaxOG: should mind control check mobs around the boss to see if there is any cheeky abilities they ahve to debuff the boss
[6:36:53] kirk_hunts: Not melee hunters
[6:36:57] tigerslap_ow: did he consume the ears to regain health?
[6:36:57] Yaboyskins: theres no way u need more players
[6:36:57] DNuKeM91: not more players
[6:36:57] kirk_hunts: Ranges hunters
[6:36:59] Exempt_Instinct: @Xaryu if its not a mechanic theres nothing you can do, so assume it is and try and figure out what the mechanic might be.
[6:37:00] PhokingTV_: 500 MELEE HUNTERS ITLL BE DEAD in 5 MINS
[6:37:03] taylorsdank: I think without the DDOS it wouldve worked
[6:37:03] sushileafbeats: that was enough players
[6:37:04] Kongapuss: they want him to be killed, but not at lvl 40. He drops somes some items related to lvl 60 which will require much less players and much less stress on the server. In order to prevent people from getting angry or loot dropping that they didnt want they increased the health to make in unkillable
[6:37:04] CrerisRs: @axantur12 if boss gains hp based on hp of other people it doesnt matter if you absorb fatal damage, cause you still dont have high hp pool. That would be some really whacky mechanic interaction
[6:37:04] PaperbackWritter: if you need 17M it is not possible
[6:37:05] absolute3x: uptime!
[6:37:05] DankestDingus: locks with dots
[6:37:08] keweiy: lol hc first commenters. it is sad
[6:37:08] absolute3x: Exactly
[6:37:09] nickels396: less trolls not more players
[6:37:09] BonerB: @Xaryu are you disappointed about missing out on the fomo of the first stv boss kill?
[6:37:09] aluskyy: they said servers were getting ddos'd tho
[6:37:09] britcoffins: @detourz28 no it happened last night too when they were trying it
[6:37:09] fatlittlepaypig: issue is 20 year old servers
[6:37:10] StormshieldFaerlina: AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count. AT 20% his max hp increases according to his ear count.
[6:37:11] dryforg1v1ng: @Xaryu what if everyone needs to run ZF to get the carrot on a stick at level 40 to run the boss in circles and he loses ear buff
[6:37:12] kronic10: @xaryu theres a ddos atm
[6:37:12] neodude24: ITS A DDOS
[6:37:13] tztdarth: THE DC HAPPENED BECAUSE BLIZZ HAD A DDOS ATTACK @Xaryu
[6:37:14] Miraelia: thinking about the lore, what if at 20% everybody needs to drop their blood at the altar ? @Xaryu
[6:37:14] Bromorin: need specific comp tbh
[6:37:15] koldhanded: true
[6:37:15] ImThatFella: Wait I have a alert from blizzard saying they are getting ddosed is that from your thingZ?
[6:37:17] Bromorin: 1 button buuilds
[6:37:17] BryanC614: need blizzard to get good man thats all. you guys had that
[6:37:19] Chiphazzord: having a ddos at that time was just bad luck
[6:37:23] PhokingTV_: DID YOU TRY ASKING IT NICELY FOR LOOT ? @Xaryu
[6:37:25] hashg0dx: people in chat seriously thinking its DDOS
[6:37:26] Uzziah56: @xaryu have you tried taking him out of STV?
[6:37:26] SkyGeGee: if you're a warrior or rogue, stay home as usual
[6:37:28] absolute3x: Uptime is a perfect word i was thinking of
[6:37:28] hashg0dx: xD
[6:37:31] WordOfJesus: guys, How does Xar have the Elite banner around his character frame?
[6:37:31] Mubistar: just all palas  with bubble
[6:37:31] itsphilw: Kappa
[6:37:32] lukemeleney: go teleport somewhere random?
[6:37:34] tigerslap_ow: don't restart battlenet. its a 15 min que to login right now
[6:37:35] Doimos89: i don't think it is anything has to do with crazy coordiantion, it's SOD
[6:37:36] neonhvit: So did it drop something or?
[6:37:37] PhokingTV_: DID YOU TRY ASKING IT NICELY FOR LOOT ? @Xaryu 󠀀
[6:37:38] CrerisRs: @Tommyb_nyc_5 his hp wouldve gone up 255 times which it didnt so probably not
[6:37:39] taylorsdank: this is a moment in history
[6:37:39] keweiy: yes

[6:37:46] tztdarth: GM SHOWING UP WAS 10/10
[6:37:46] Larewt: @hashg0dx I was getting Dc'd on another server constantly
[6:37:46] sushileafbeats: im sticking to the GM scaled it theory, by accident

[6:37:59] Ilove_togetwet: @Xaryu there is a que to log in right now because it says they are currently experiencing an attack
