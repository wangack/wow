[2:14:10] crematedBrain: well true Mr_Moffert, however combining it with "Players will also see an increase in experience gained within the Blackfathom Deeps raid dungeon when it is cleared. The raid dungeon will still continue to run with the current lockout timer, and players will no longer gain the world buff beyond level 39, however." makes it reasonable imo

[2:30:02] BikiniBodhi: that was a bug
[2:30:04] Rahmulous: Guzu have you ever heard of this movie called Water World? it’s BiS
[2:30:06] BikiniBodhi: aggrend said so
[2:30:15] GwionLlyr: ICD for windfury like tbc
[2:30:15] wreckstormx: how are your bags not always filled up?
[2:30:16] Lissard: gl getting a group without full gear at this point tbh
[2:30:17] m1cke90: GCD of windfury increased, meaning less procs

[2:30:43] mithrandoig: @Lissard if you arent parsing dont even play right
[2:30:58] DamDamPew: Mr Guzu do you think we will get 40 man raids later on? I enjoy big raids a lot more.
[2:31:24] Tropicocity: It has higher dps and more top end damage than prebis raid 2handers lol
[2:31:27] Syloa: 12?
[2:31:29] Rahmulous: They know people won’t play warrior if it’s more complex than one button
[2:31:30] piperboi: not 40 man plz
[2:31:33] Soulzone: i pref 10man
[2:31:34] bronchoped1: 40 is just a chore...
[2:31:36] dreamreamer: 20 MAN IS PEFECT
[2:31:36] Gostaw: i think we get 20 at 50
[2:31:36] Mr_Moffert: same
[2:31:37] krulfar: 20 is bis
[2:31:39] MVPeteTV: pls no 40 man
[2:31:42] biki2112: 40 man is classic
[2:31:43] nareshamidday: 40 man raid is literally the worst LU>
[2:31:45] mackattack4208: 20 is BiS
[2:31:45] grylz89: Do you use tclap rune? Or CBR
[2:31:46] Radikul: 15 man inc
[2:31:46] BarberSnipez: i like 40 lol
[2:31:47] Mr_Moffert: yea im really sad gnomer is a 10man
[2:31:53] Mr_Moffert: 40 is comfy
[2:31:54] tresher1: 25mwn?
[2:31:54] losfisk: 20 to 25 man max
[2:31:59] fenris77p: 40 man bis
[2:32:02] Huntenn: Just give us flex
[2:32:05] BabaChaw: 10 is good for pugging. 20 is better for quality. 40 .. you just need so many people online
[2:32:11] Clinsure: If they do 40 man, they need to add more loot drop
[2:32:11] excent_: 40man raids will kill the game
[2:32:12] TradewindFTW: IMO, at level 25, 10 is fine.  for level 40, should've been 15 or 20 with level 50 going to 25 and level 60 at 40 man.
[2:32:12] bronchoped1: @mr_moffert leveling raids should be 10 man. Makes sense
[2:32:13] Belfelol: i love 10 man raiding so much! for a semi casual player its so good
[2:32:13] Fungdork: 40 man isn't harder to put together than any other size, because it's the same issue as a retail store. you try to skeleton crew to have the minimum necessary and then any absence fucks you.
[2:32:17] Kersed805: ZG was perfection
[2:32:17] grylz89: @guzu Do you use tclap rune? Or CBR
[2:32:18] BarberSnipez: a pug 40 man sounds awful, a guild 40 isnt bad
[2:32:19] Fungdork: the amount of people in the raid doesn't matter
[2:32:21] fenris77p: It is but it just feels so much better!
[2:32:22] twitchforgotmyaccount: 40-man is great when someone else does the logistics
[2:32:22] irlEric: w the new gear u can 20 man 40 man raids
[2:32:26] studshift: they should do 20man w/ 40man loot :P
[2:32:27] Fungdork: it's about people being selfish and needing to never miss out
[2:32:28] wisenot: its true but 40 is still better
[2:32:31] StreamElements: Follow my Twitter, NOW! Madge https://www.twitter.com/guzuTV
[2:32:32] chr47: 25 man is BiS imho, works out better with groups
[2:32:33] litenroger: Everquest was 72 in the beginning. 40 is small scale :) But yes it sucks with organizing these big raids
[2:32:40] mackattack4208: hell yea brother
[2:32:43] Radikul: 72 wtf
[2:32:44] Mr_Moffert: @bronchoped1 i dont think bfd and gnomer are "levelng raids" since were stuck on the phase for a while
[2:32:44] wreckstormx: imagine being a paladin and buff 40 ppl plus pets every 5 minutes
[2:32:55] Fungdork: your critique of 40 man raids is a fallacy
[2:32:58] Fungdork: it's not about the number
[2:33:03] bl1nk_1298: the only people who WANT 40 man raids have never organized one lol
[2:33:04] Fungdork: it's about recruiting people unwilling to sit
[2:33:04] Rixxey: 10 man is BiS imo. easy to play with friends and ugs
[2:33:05] bronchoped1: @wreckstormx no longer 5 minutes at 40
[2:33:06] Rixxey: pugs
[2:33:09] ScootSmith: Guzu gets sad when he cant see his name on the DPS list in 40 man groups
[2:33:09] mackattack4208: om
[2:33:11] SuperLost89: @Guzu thoughts on them doing a static 20 man thats harder with better loot, and then a normal version that's flex?
[2:33:12] Moogimog: The developer said that a 40 man raid was less demanding than a 10man raid, where everyone has an important role to play. And that it was precisely the philosophy of SOD to be less "hardcore". I don't like it :/
[2:33:15] saren_x: ???
[2:33:16] Holyfoly: 40 is so awesome, unless you are the one doing the organisation
[2:33:21] dolesy20: I'd rather have the 20man raids. I've done plenty of 40 mans
[2:33:27] Ewriick: om
[2:33:28] derpaherbertt: it means its a penis
[2:33:29] krulfar: om
[2:33:30] Fungdork: no because that's a problem at 5 or 500

[2:33:32] BlauUmlaut: my god the EQ raid groups were (at the time) mega epic
[2:33:34] mackattack4208: it's always about the number...
[2:33:36] Fungdork: it doesn't matter what the number is
[2:33:37] mayyoo_V2: peepoSwing  󠀀
[2:33:37] Soulzone: We just need more raids imo BASEDCIGAR
[2:33:38] wreckstormx: @bronchoped1 i know im talking about 40 man raids in vanilla
[2:33:39] sexylegs9: Why aren't you unbooning? @Guzu
[2:33:39] Deliverererer: yeah that's literally the argument against 40
[2:33:40] Fungdork: you'll have the same problem
[2:33:41] saren_x: ????????????
[2:33:42] Fungdork: at 20 or 500
[2:33:42] Dr_RobT: The only people who want 40 man raids are the people who were gettting invited as teh 38th and 39th person as a random fill and they got lucky and took the loot
[2:33:43] Eisval_Okom: he means he's a phallus see?
[2:33:45] Syloa: ????
[2:33:46] twitchforgotmyaccount: @Fungdork huh
[2:33:48] bl1nk_1298: @Fungdork homie is trying to sound smarter than the point hes making lol
[2:33:50] Dr_RobT: nobody who organizes raids wants 40 man raids
[2:33:51] Diddly_dope: UNBOON
[2:33:57] wisenot: nah its harder the bigger the raid
[2:33:59] Fungdork: it's not, I've been doing it for fucking 20 years rofl
[2:34:01] Snackybox: true and real
[2:34:02] Rixxey: @Fungdork go make a 500 man raid ill wait om
[2:34:05] krulfar: @Fungdork if you have 2-3 people giving problems at 20, you would have 4-6 at 40, ez maths om
[2:34:07] chr47: true
[2:34:11] Muaytitus: LOL
[2:34:11] Radikul: @Fungdork Kappa
[2:34:13] pizzawizardmoji: just say: tanks do stuff
[2:34:13] fenris77p: True, but not that much more annoying...
[2:34:13] Kazay1998: @Snackybox alowo big ma
[2:34:14] eXWeiner: lmfao larp
[2:34:15] tresher1: D:
[2:34:17] Foodlebar: GOTTEM
[2:34:19] alecx69420: even 20 man mythic is rough sometimes, fewer ppl is always easier
[2:34:19] Ewriick: @Fungdork more ppl walking their dogs and needing to pee and getting water and doing mechanics or listening gets more challenging the larger a raid gets, you can't argue with that
[2:34:22] Rixxey: 40 ppl is ass
[2:34:23] Foodlebar: OneGuy in the chat
[2:34:25] Moogimog: I don't have time now to organize a 40 man raid, i'm not 15 like in vanilla
[2:34:26] Snackybox: more drama in 40 man too
[2:34:28] mackattack4208: OneGuy
[2:34:28] Syloa: the biggest source of stress and drama in wow is other people. fewer people = less drama
[2:34:29] nareshamidday: bro think doing that thing for 20 years is making the point LUL
[2:34:29] Deliverererer: clearly lost their mind from organizing 40 ppl for 20 years
[2:34:30] Rixxey: 40 ppl I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY EVEN ARE
[2:34:33] studshift: its ass for loot and its ass for sign ups
[2:34:33] Serpentsting2: 40 ppl is to much
[2:34:35] Fungdork: the problem is that you need to have people that bench, doesn't matter if it's for a 10 man or a 40 man. that's the only problem. you need to have people who will only raid sometimes
[2:34:37] icubicc: 2 head andy feels like legit cockboii
[2:34:44] alecx69420: YEP
[2:34:44] studshift: if u have a 40man roster, just make 2 20 mans lol
[2:34:45] Jinxul: loot distribution is more terrible
[2:34:51] Coggn: Always someone AFK ina 40 man
[2:34:52] Tangents92: No reason to make 40 man no more GDKP :(
[2:34:52] Fungdork: it'sabout the type of people, not the amount
[2:34:52] Tomoglaziat: He is a dumbass more toons the harder its
[2:35:00] Lunaris100: I don't get loot in 10 mans, I dread to think how bad it would be in 20/25/40
[2:35:04] krulfar: and in 40 men you need literally double
[2:35:12] asddyo: 40 man raid is a battle of attrition
[2:35:12] Ticklezao: ICANT
[2:35:13] Diddly_dope: unboon
[2:35:15] Rixxey: @Fungdork benched players need to PuG, pugs are easier as 10 man. fuck a 40 man you can't even name 40 people
[2:35:15] Soulzone: more ppl TrollDespair
[2:35:16] Syloa: ICANT
[2:35:18] tresher1: YEP
[2:35:20] Ewriick: @Fungdork with more people, the risk of the "wrong type" in your raid increases
[2:35:22] Justyy52: and more loot drama :D :D
[2:35:22] bl1nk_1298: @Fungdork youre wrong on this one lol. no matter what activity, the more people involved, the more complicated it is.
[2:35:22] dani_dorko: u need 40 man that want to commit every week. els you will lose gear every week
[2:35:23] Tangents92: @Diddly_dope Think he is saving for kel and aku
[2:35:24] Toastedyogurt: ABOZO
