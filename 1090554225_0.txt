[1:05:51] DragonofWolves: Man i hate they nerfed the hatchets, those things were OP as well but also fun as hell to use
[1:06:26] apopthis: @dragonofwolves Ya. It sucked but honestly needed to be done. Everyone was using those damn things. It would have been really boring in pvp
[1:06:48] Riggoz1: whats your rep at? im finding it getting boring to do it everyday now
[1:06:52] apopthis: I personally think anyway
[1:07:32] Jayko337: There’s definitely a catch to the buy to play. The shop is going to be filled with shit that you’re going to want. So you’ll end up spending more money on New World than wow. Watch lol

[1:09:31] DragonofWolves: I'd laugh if blizz came out with their own version of pokemon go
[1:09:44] akia03: @Towelliee hows your mythic prog going ?
[1:09:57] ElDrakenMan: can you imagine waiting in line at doctors office getting those dailies done? Daum

[1:12:57] stallowned: any 6 days
[1:13:03] Fangy_Playz: @towelliee MMO gaming is hot again. WoW kicking off with this raid tier, New World coming out, Final Fantasy spiking in players so bad that they ran out of digital copies. Everquest release expansion number 100 Kappa
[1:14:06] DragonofWolves: I was just about to say you're a pally you can't heroic leap to get treasures but i saw the venthyr ability

[1:15:54] Fangy_Playz: Blizzard will release something to combat Endwalker
[1:16:02] ahla03: playing yeah it would make sense, but tbf mobile games have NEVER fared well on twitch.
[1:16:10] dutchie76: yea the will release a TBC phase
[1:16:19] ahla03: the resolution is weird and the viewer experience will be pretty bad
[1:16:32] Fangy_Playz: Probably black temple to be honest
[1:16:35] DragonofWolves: True blizz would release a TBC phase because they wouldn't dare rush out 9.2
[1:16:53] aikopooh: endwalker will be released in november right idk about blizz releasing something to relate
[1:16:59] dutchie76: 9.2 imo isnt coming out till next year
[1:17:05] dutchie76: early
[1:17:10] DragonofWolves: this is true
[1:17:17] luckfore: mid august together with 9.2? :O

[1:20:47] Colt_Engineer: unless you do pvp like halo 2 or 3, pvp can never be truly balanced
[1:20:50] MOLAR305: want to pvp? go play an fps
[1:20:50] Wulfgrym: PVP is a side thing, no one really cares except for a small niche
[1:21:25] akia03: pvp mmos also need allot more devs and such for balancing
[1:21:32] BeeMazed: ARK it just comes down to who can stay up longer. It is fun for a weekend with some friends though
[1:21:39] Fangy_Playz: @towelliee I'm in school for game design and I story boarded a MMO and I was like man this sounds good. But the further I get into my game design knowledge I'm like. "This is going to be a BITCH to code."
[1:22:23] wildcat_19: i feel like they had somethin like that in swg w/ powerful npcs at bases
[1:23:03] BeeMazed: There is room for different comps in the seiges but world PvP there will be a meta.
[1:23:25] MOLAR305: castles should only be available to claim for like 6 hours a day and the longer you have the castle it will be harder to take. you get guardians you can upgrade by investing in the castle daily
[1:23:28] Fight_Monkey: Blade and soul pulled off pvp i think. Very 1v1 focused
[1:24:02] CatoireLore: I always get nervous about keeps in pvp. I played on a shadowbane server where one powerhouse guild literally controlled the server and it was insane

[1:25:55] warrenny: Sylv

[1:26:09] Ezekyler: pulls*
[1:26:11] grapyz: making a rare like this in open world content was not a smart idea on blizz part. It created so much toxic lmao
[1:26:45] Ezekyler: Echo 60% and Limit 61% @Towelliee
[1:26:50] grapyz: blood dk is perfect for this. just grip him away

[1:34:25] Colt_Engineer: I can't enough of those memes
[1:34:27] BeeMazed: New World is the most hyped new MMO in at least 5-6 years pretty excited =)
[1:34:30] Waffilios: Competition is always good
[1:34:40] CritcobainTV: its a shit fight to watch
[1:34:40] sinlesssinner: its sunday, ppl are out i think
[1:34:44] Wulfgrym: i don't think most people care lol
[1:34:46] luckfore: eveyone is play FF14 remember

[1:34:51] sinlesssinner: i just got back home from a day out
[1:34:52] Stoneric: @Towelliee any thoughts on Palia? I'm generally interested in it, seems like a whole different vibe for a MMO. Any of course New World

[1:35:29] Wulfgrym: 77.2k on asmon stream
[1:35:30] Macnerd1239: the fight is boring and they keep turning comms off so its just a silent stream. not surprised no ones watching.
[1:35:31] Beastafied: Sundays! day of rest.
[1:35:47] Ezekyler: i'm playing FFXIV looks and play like WoW but i put a sticker on the screen it says it's FFXIV Kappa
[1:35:48] Orcmondo: my grass is like 4 inches too tall, too busy wowing

[1:37:01] Epiclawlzable: they are still doing their blue microphone listen ins every few pulls
[1:37:13] Waffilios: Limit hasn’t they are just chilling waiting for boss timers
[1:37:18] nightmayor12: max's stream has all comms
[1:37:23] theDirtyon3: just watch max's stream not the complexity stream guys
[1:37:25] Eraste: shoot i barely hit rank 4 yesterday. was disappointed i got basically nothing from it
[1:37:26] nightmayor12: better than the caster channel
[1:37:41] Jayko337: Palia is animal crossing lol
[1:37:52] Dudamnit: palia seems nice and cozy, community-sim
[1:37:53] Janwaat: Janwaat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 86 months! towHi
[1:37:53] Average_Stali: just hit rank 5 today and all i could do was but the ability to loot the stupid ghost swords in korthia
[1:37:59] pilhass10: Method is popping off
[1:38:01] Stoneric: @Towelliee Palia is a massively-multiplayer community simulation game set in a brand new high fantasy world with elements of open world adventure games. It’s a cozy and welcoming world that we hope fans of the community sim genre will love for years to come.
[1:38:05] apopthis: Paila is MMO Animal Crossing
[1:38:27] Aidler: echo is taking a break
[1:38:38] Jayko337: Give me a wow pvp mmo please
[1:38:40] oldmcstabbin: blizzard only did good instances and raids the last long while kekw
[1:38:53] akia03: palia looks awesome only game im looking forward to
[1:38:57] pilhass10: you just missed 1 rare in your realm LUL
[1:39:11] Average_Stali: even the gear upgrades are rep locked behind 61 for the 226 gear...my guild is progressing KT on normal and painsmith on heroic, i will be overgeared when i can finally buy the upgrades
[1:39:12] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:39:33] Waffilios: I really do think they need to reclear next reset to have the dmg to be able to kill her. The fight is so boring though
[1:39:44] pilhass10: I'm rank 6 in 1 week max 2
[1:40:00] akia03: and upgrade 5-6 at rank 6 plus a ton of renown
[1:40:02] BeeMazed: They need to stop balancing the game around M+ and super causal players
[1:40:04] rei__03: @Waffilios and what is a fun fight in ur opinion?
[1:40:07] BeeMazed: and Mythic raiders
[1:40:19] pilhass10: it's only 16k from rank 5 to 6
[1:40:35] luckfore: 9.1 feels like it was made by a small group of ppl and 9.2 will be big
[1:40:43] Waffilios: @rosashy denathrius was a super fun fight
[1:40:57] Average_Stali: and you get a decent 1k rep for looting the sword treasures
[1:41:01] akia03: i started solo killing rares again takes to long to wait
[1:41:07] pilhass10: I tought it would be like 21k so
[1:41:24] ILikeKillTheZombies: Ion is hyping every patch Kappa
[1:41:35] Average_Stali: so big cos its the prepatch
[1:41:41] rei__03: i could see that
[1:41:45] aikopooh: but question is can that patch bring ppl back or not also how long it will hold players in that patch
[1:41:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee i mean it would be the last patch considering it's already been almost a year XD
[1:41:56] 123Sepi123: Wow is your main game right towelboy? thats the only game i enjoy watching since I play it myself while I have a wow streamer on twitch
[1:42:49] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee he needs to stop asking about covenants tbh and start asking about some other stuff that's related to the game
[1:42:52] mmrghost7: blizz will not change jack cuz of interviews
[1:43:17] MOLAR305: are they all back in the office?
[1:43:24] CritcobainTV: basically they would have to just make it so the draught was at the start of the expansion instead of at the end right? @Towelliee
[1:43:27] ILikeKillTheZombies: Blizzard is at similar situation like with wod, you had wildstar on the horizon and now new world, ff and ashes
[1:43:50] Arocian: new expansion is going to push out
[1:43:53] Bixster: Working from home is probably also not as exciting when you work on something as wow.
[1:44:05] akia03: 9.2 is cata 2.0 remade azorath?
[1:44:42] Average_Stali: next expac will be an old god one fo sho, i believe that N'Zoth planned this whole thing out!

[1:46:11] zyppeli: @Towelliee Hyped for new world?
[1:46:24] Bixster: is there even something coming with the classic phases? maybe last phase with the sunwell isle
[1:46:31] Eraste: new world is like mid august or something like that
[1:46:32] sakura_2020: how's progress going for Shade?
[1:46:40] Strange_Inquiries: @Rottencoarse It hasn't though. It's brought industry developers rather than game developers. Not sure if you understand what i'm saying. The developers there are not the passionate devs there once were and this is happening across gaming companies.
[1:46:42] aikopooh: world first ends boom wow viewers go down back to normal lol
[1:46:46] warrenny: Still raiding starting heroic next week most likely
[1:46:48] BeeMazed: The leveling time in New World will be similar to the leveling time in Classic WoW
[1:46:49] akia03: is new world a good stream game tho with all the crafting and no raids/pvp like arena
[1:46:52] pilhass10: PogChamo

[1:47:04] GTmask: he knows!
[1:47:40] mmrghost7: shame sylvanas doesnt have secret phase
[1:48:07] BeeMazed: I think New World will put in a Battle Pass but I could be wrong.
[1:48:20] BeeMazed: I would prefer a Battle Pass over a crazy cash shop
[1:48:34] BeeMazed: They were thinking about it
[1:48:45] akia03: @mmrghost7 that would make it a 20 plus minute fight wouldnt it than

[1:53:16] A_New_Challenger: So...still on track for 31st of next month?
[1:53:16] MOLAR305: limit got her to 65 again. consistent pulls. this bitch is going down today I think
[1:53:38] Norcore: @SilkeySmooth ofc, the streamers will be there to make a show, nobody cares about some sperg trying to ruin the fun
[1:53:44] Eraste: that would be surprising, considering how everyone was bitching about how overtuned the whole raid was when it launched

[2:00:52] apopthis: @lithium364 not really. It's mostly cosmetic and lore
[2:00:55] Norcore: @lithium364 it's just roleplay, and of course the faction determines what guilds you can join
[2:01:10] tadeeche: says you can switch faction but only once every 120 days
[2:01:24] CritcobainTV: @Wulfgrym nah >:)

[2:12:42] Vivelli: the whole team? oh ok cool
[2:12:49] BeeMazed: New world favors the side that is pushing a territory to war so eventually, a territory will get pushed it can only be delayed.
[2:13:04] Vivelli: oh Im Pepega ok dont mind me
[2:13:25] MOLAR305: I pictured in my head the team captains drafting streamers like a fantasy football draft lol
[2:13:26] Sollice: I watched SolidFPS streams during Outriders. Good streamer
[2:13:39] BRUTALIT0PS: @BRUTALIT0PS I honestly don't know, I have not been paying any attention to New World at all because I am nolifing my college atm, lol
[2:13:56] Streets404: i wanted to go #TeamSyndicate, but i don't know that EU streamers at all :3 so for beta i will choose probalby #TeamCoventant and help Zmok/Naguura from EU
[2:14:12] Vivelli: sucks the beta is only open for 2 weeks tho. but just means release is right around the corner
[2:14:20] BeeMazed: Was that her cooking on the Limit stream?
[2:14:23] lithium364: is there an page with all the teams on it for information?
[2:14:24] akia03: even if the race ends today?

[2:18:04] Vivelli: once beta releases, does the NDA for the alpha content get lifted? idk how that works

[2:18:20] duhworks: that need to be a mega sever than
[2:18:26] lithium364: only 1 EU Team is announced so far (covenant)?
[2:18:35] Broomba: @towelliee -- do u think New world beta will be better optimized than the alpha version?
[2:18:37] Streets404: i wonder who we get in EU for Marauders team
[2:18:47] apopthis: @lithium364 Covenant is on NA East
[2:19:05] Vivelli: oh thats cool
[2:19:08] Vivelli: i cant wait
[2:19:08] apopthis: No EU teams that I've seen @lithium364
[2:19:25] zSKIz1: so the big news is the team?

[2:57:21] NOHITJEROME: have you ever been part of one of those runs?
[2:57:23] MOLAR305: if you are lightee you go win PoE seasons
[2:58:13] Fenwig: @Towelliee They knew just didnt wanna get banned for cheesing

[2:58:40] ohnomyvirgineyes: are pally tanks less squishy since 9.1

[2:58:42] NOHITJEROME: blizzard wouldnt ban them for that LUL
[2:58:42] ohnomyvirgineyes: ?
[2:59:10] Aidler: Was it the job of max to know of the trinket? well i have no idea...
[2:59:20] ohnomyvirgineyes: this is why i stopped playing my pally tank
[3:00:25] MOLAR305: avade had done it the night before
[3:00:42] MOLAR305: so they knew. but waited on echo
[3:00:49] SavageCheez: he did before the quit this morning
[3:01:09] crashoverride_gaming: kinda funny how one trinket had such an impact on the race though
[3:01:39] Aidler: that was a definit f up from blizzards side

[3:02:34] akia03: like the bombs on lich king
[3:02:34] Brodih_: noob here, what does the trinket do to help the fight ?
[3:02:41] SavageCheez: Max commended Echo on the good strat (using the trinket)
[3:03:08] Aidler: that's good sportmanship
[3:03:14] akia03: @Qhaz_ lets you ress so adds despawn
[3:03:51] akia03: @Qhaz_ so dps takes tank buster resses with trinket and that mechanic is null
[3:03:56] tadeeche: dont blame echo for using it blame blizzard for letting that get through
[3:04:12] Aidler: @tadeeche true
[3:04:14] NOHITJEROME: LUL
[3:04:29] SoriinX: 10 15sec adds in a row.. Jesus thats fucking awful
[3:04:30] NOHITJEROME: testing mythic mechanics must be pretty difficult
[3:04:31] Brodih_: ah ok thanks @diathi123
[3:04:38] NOHITJEROME: itd be hard not to miss something
[3:05:20] Aidler: fixed for the reclear naguuraMonkaS
[3:05:29] Brodih_: would blizz nerf the trinket for the reset ?
[3:05:32] akia03: and you cant acept bliz to know all the wierd strats these guilds will use
[3:05:46] Eraste: i know im not watching really atm cause i know its gonna be a while
[3:05:46] Rudric_Ice: the bigger question is who will get the world first sylvanas mount

[3:06:24] BeeMazed: Asmon at almost 100k right now doing old FFIV dungeons lol
[3:06:24] akia03: mythic is already shorter than heroic
[3:06:27] NOHITJEROME: i thought the best fight this patch was painsmith
[3:06:31] NOHITJEROME: its really easy to follow as a viewer
[3:06:41] NOHITJEROME: and you can see the skill of the players and their mistakes in realtime
[3:06:59] tadeeche: 4-3-2-1
[3:07:02] Sollice: Just an update for everyone......Unless its RWF stuff, we aren't really interested in other streamers playing other games
[3:07:09] MOLAR305: 63% 18 alive
[3:07:13] Sollice: We know some people are enjoying FF14 lol
[3:07:17] Rudric_Ice: painsmith was they only boss which was fun to watch
[3:07:25] NOHITJEROME: painsmith is fun because you can really follow it as a viewer
[3:07:33] MOLAR305: damn that soak went south
[3:07:34] NOHITJEROME: i can relate to dodging traps indiana jones style LUL
[3:07:43] NOHITJEROME: and making mistakes and instantly dying
[3:07:46] Aidler: @Sollice swiftYep
[3:08:54] akia03: is 225 itemlvl on a lock good enough to start sod heroic?
[3:08:54] Rudric_Ice: the worst boss was after painsmith that was a snooze fest LUL
[3:09:12] MOLAR305: man limit got her to 63% had 18 alive and then before hitting a new best just went splat... that raid dmg is just soooo much
[3:09:12] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:09:56] NOHITJEROME: how do they keep the entire raid topped up? are there any raid wide heals
[3:10:00] NOHITJEROME: or is it just really good healing assignments
[3:10:12] Rudric_Ice: maybe they over tuned it without saying anything LUL
[3:10:15] NOHITJEROME: sometimes the entire raid seems to take massive damage at the same time but they get topped up instantly
[3:10:17] BeeMazed: You have to stagger healer CDs
[3:10:37] Aidler: 4 teams on Sylvanas is interesting but no viewer can follow 100 tries each 8 - 10 minutes towRip
[3:10:57] Rudric_Ice: back to venthyr tow ?
[3:11:13] Mecabeast: im super proud of bdgg it looks like their recruitment is really paying off
[3:11:43] MOLAR305: it's like 9 mins just to get to phase 3
[3:12:07] NOHITJEROME: lmao
[3:12:11] NOHITJEROME: thats pretty likely tbh LUL
[3:12:15] NOHITJEROME: theres no way that trinket is intended right
[3:12:21] NOHITJEROME: to bypass mechanics
[3:12:29] MOLAR305: I would expect them to hit fix it
[3:12:44] Wildside1177: He just said he thinks it will die today.
[3:12:44] MOLAR305: hot*

[3:14:29] BeeMazed: He is on the Syndicate team with Smashly
[3:14:53] Wildside1177: where are the new world teams posted?

[3:16:04] MOLAR305: divine bell wq is up for anyone needing it
[3:16:19] Broseidon7624: burke is bringing the whole late shift
[3:16:22] Raffah_: cant wait to watch
[3:16:22] NOHITJEROME: that sounds sweet
[3:16:36] the_bad_goat: So watching the world first and thought what would it take for you to join limit or bdg and legit compete if you wanted to?
[3:16:45] akia03: and team twitch chat to take them all down
[3:17:01] Versedric: hello mr towel my name is Poon
[3:17:09] Wildside1177: Too bad Cohh didn't like New World.
[3:17:10] Norcore: @Towelliee Summit's a friend of Josh OMEGALUL
[3:17:13] NOHITJEROME: ya or you at a huge disadvantage LUL
[3:17:20] Aidler: I kinda hope the RWF is finished before the New World beta starts
[3:17:27] Versedric: you picked my CD up in broad daylight and you scratched it
[3:17:36] BeeMazed: What about Sodapoppin?
[3:17:41] mneYEP: hows that chinese team doing?
[3:18:00] MOLAR305: I think they are 5/10
[3:18:16] NOHITJEROME: are they 2 days behind start time wise?
[3:18:18] NOHITJEROME: or are they struggling
[3:18:20] mneYEP: better than i expected actually lol
[3:18:40] mneYEP: 11 out of 10 would be pretty good
[3:18:42] Norcore: 11/10 KEKW
[3:18:48] akia03: aster got all the players but not the players raidleaders
[3:18:48] NOHITJEROME: is there a chinese server or do they have 400 ping
[3:18:49] Aidler: china not as strong as we thought
[3:18:54] apopthis: 11/10 is the same as 5/7
[3:19:02] 91Niki: 11/10 that's twitch chat Kappa
[3:19:10] BeeMazed: You can try to bring in Pace22, he is big into New World PvP
[3:19:24] Wildside1177: Sylvanus is a long distance run, not a sprint.
[3:19:30] Eraste: i already beat the 9.2 raid Kappa

[3:19:54] Raffah_: Josh has been playing the closed alpha a lot
[3:20:03] akia03: you need thdlock to farm in new world
[3:20:30] Sluggin1: Josh grinds mmos and does his homework
[3:20:33] Raffah_: I have seen some of the expeditions, they are amazing
[3:20:38] Strange_Inquiries: @Towelliee I'm going to be honest, I really hate the fucking maw. So many Debuffs and such an annoyance to play in. It's kind of trash. Am i missing something here that it sucks so much for me?
[3:20:49] Norcore: I see Lirik i type lirikOSVN

[3:21:19] akia03: souls
[3:21:24] Norcore: @D3adlyDoughnut said Lirik LUL
[3:21:48] NOHITJEROME: has new world added new content? in the beta it was very solid but there was like 1 quest type LUL
[3:21:55] NOHITJEROME: combat was good tho
[3:22:01] Raffah_: they changed everything
[3:22:02] Broseidon7624: just invite asmon Kappa
[3:22:20] danieel770: hi im new
[3:22:50] NOHITJEROME: thats good the game has a lot of potential
[3:22:53] BeeMazed: I feel like they should bring Swifty in one of the teams. He is an OG MMO player. Would be a good fit for the Syndicate team.
[3:23:11] NOHITJEROME: anything funded by amazon has a chance to be good, cant believe what they did with crucible
[3:23:17] blazenalot: what legendary are you making for the paladin?
[3:23:20] NOHITJEROME: i think crucible was a good wakeup call for them
[3:23:51] NOHITJEROME: ya different team but the execs must have seen it
[3:23:55] Norcore: yeah dungeons weren't even a thing last year, neither expeditions, there are legendary quest lines where you get legendary weapons, lots of stuff was added
[3:24:01] ogOnydruid: mr towel, long time no see man. hows horde treating ya
[3:24:05] roogar1234: @Towelliee thoughts on new world?

[3:24:57] BionicMagician: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:25:10] BeeMazed: They should tune World PvP bosses for 20+ people. If more try to zerg the boss then there should be extra buffs on the world bosses.
[3:25:10] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:25:34] NOHITJEROME: yeah i think everyone remembers the beta and nothing else
[3:25:35] BeeMazed: World bosses not world PvP bosses
[3:25:39] NOHITJEROME: or alpha i forget what it was
[3:25:52] NOHITJEROME: the shelf life of new MMOs is definitely a concern to me
[3:26:02] NOHITJEROME: when everyone plays 18 hours per day the content is gonna be done in 2 weeks LUL
[3:26:07] BeeMazed: Someone data mined something that looked like their version of M+
[3:26:09] bgriff87: KEKW
[3:26:11] love_eggplant: is new world also pve friendly now?
[3:26:16] love_eggplant: last time i checked it was a pvp game

[3:26:45] AzizianQ: i have no friend to play with Sadge
[3:26:46] NOHITJEROME: just from the alpha the pvp is all about ganging up on people
[3:26:48] Nardap: i think new world might be best for pvp content in the long run
[3:26:59] NOHITJEROME: so definitely good to have a guild
[3:27:08] NOHITJEROME: also the territory stuff would be impossible solo
[3:27:16] RavenARPG: I am really hoping for new world
[3:27:27] NOHITJEROME: i really like the territory system design :D
[3:27:30] NOHITJEROME: building up a city is very cool
[3:27:45] JonnyFivesAlive: what server you playing on?
[3:27:47] NOHITJEROME: i like that idea
[3:27:49] Raffah_: they probably gonna cap the servers to 5k+ ppl
[3:27:51] NOHITJEROME: twitch integrated MMOs
[3:27:52] Raffah_: LUL
[3:27:56] akia03: so other guilds on that server if they atack the streamers they can get banned ?
[3:27:59] 91Niki: monkaS
[3:28:01] Norcore: @BeeMazed I haven't heard of this but sounds amazing. I really like how currently gems attached to weapons modify weapon dmg type (for example converts half of your weapon dmg to fire, or other elements), it could be interesting seeing how would that interact with M+ type dungeons
[3:28:06] NOHITJEROME: wow could definitely integrate more into twitch as well, maybe we will see some big innovation
[3:28:16] crashoverride_gaming: what server?
[3:28:20] NOHITJEROME: amazon owns twitch ya @ibangedaqt_
[3:28:23] 91Niki: They're watching us monkaS
[3:28:38] SoriinX: Any idea if we will be able to pre download before the 20th?
[3:28:38] CritcobainTV: towTinfoil payoS
[3:28:49] roogar1234: @Towelliee what should i except in new world? i bought the game but didnt quite read alot about it
[3:28:50] BeeMazed: @Norkore Yeah, there was something about expedition mutations. It could be anything but sounds alot like M+.
[3:28:51] Hetsartim: Are you not tired of running around doing Maw quests? Honestly curious
[3:28:56] NOHITJEROME: thats good, im excited to watch
[3:29:06] akia03: ah k so if a big guild takes over the areas of the streamers they arnt in trouble
[3:29:08] Nardap: jeff bezos is TheIlluminati you
[3:29:10] NOHITJEROME: do you have a character in mind already? more range focus, melee?
[3:29:15] NOHITJEROME: i feel like ranged had a big advantage in the alpha
[3:29:15] throwawaym3: Never thought it was funny when people did that anyways
[3:29:26] NOHITJEROME: having a rifle and just standing really far away
[3:29:30] itsChiliiii: TheIlluminati

[3:30:57] NOHITJEROME: no melee is getting near our door
[3:31:22] Phishsticks420: @d3adlydoughnut thank you for the gift sub, I think I missed it I'm at work
[3:31:24] throwawaym3: Even new world employees are trying to escape his toxic crowd
[3:31:28] anamroth: Echo coming
[3:31:37] Nardap: i remember the running for quests with no narrative content from lasts years new world beta
[3:31:47] throwawaym3: Honestly i dont blame them, its awful.
[3:31:50] Norcore: @y0sshh nobody wants to deal with it honestly... LUL
[3:31:53] 91Niki: Can't blame them
[3:32:04] NOHITJEROME: i love streamer collaboration the campaign idea seems interesting
[3:32:08] NOHITJEROME: ill watch it for sure
[3:32:11] Aidler: echo at 60 % and they fired bloodlust
[3:32:25] NOHITJEROME: amazon needs to do that or the standard for the platform will be a disaster LUL
[3:32:27] Ezekyler: Sylvanas at 55% Echo
[3:32:32] CritcobainTV: echo at 54%
[3:32:37] BeeMazed: They completely changed the direction of their game because of toxic ganking PvP
[3:32:39] NOHITJEROME: 55% jeez it might die today
[3:32:41] Aidler: 54 % no deads
[3:32:44] memnon94: 53
[3:32:46] belfastcl: I remember during the preview there were a bunch yelling racist stuff through the in-game coms
[3:32:53] Ezekyler: 53%
[3:33:13] throwawaym3: Im glad to see method is coming back
[3:33:13] 91Niki: POGGERS
[3:33:17] Felrane: what % do you need to get her to
[3:33:18] NOHITJEROME: they all instantly exploded LUL
[3:33:20] NOHITJEROME: oh my god
[3:33:21] 91Niki: RIP
[3:33:25] Norcore: LOL
[3:33:25] 3663Sharad: what was that
[3:33:26] Wildside1177: If you take quick action against toxic people as soon as a game goes online I think it will make a huge difference.
[3:33:26] MackAttack1421: 51.8%
[3:33:26] Ezekyler: 52%
[3:33:28] 3663Sharad: the fuck

[3:33:38] SavageCheez: 50
[3:33:39] Densetsu_: 50 I think
[3:33:39] bgriff87: 50
[3:33:40] Ezekyler: 50% i think
[3:33:40] aikopooh: 50
[3:33:41] MOLAR305: we assume 50
[3:33:46] Aidler: nobody knows
[3:33:48] konmenos: 51.79
[3:33:50] Nardap: i love how the lady is calm and the man is malding
[3:33:51] lithium364: 50% unless theres not some mythic only stuff
[3:33:52] 3663Sharad: scammed
[3:33:53] Ezekyler: but no one knows for sure
[3:33:56] SoriinX: @Towelliee Whats your go to GFuel flavor?
[3:33:57] throwawaym3: they're gonna get it within the next few pulls
[3:33:58] NOHITJEROME: at 50% does other stuff come out?
[3:34:00] BeeMazed: Was that a new mechanic or was it a enrage type mechanic?
[3:34:35] Ezekyler: 61%
[3:34:39] Panadol324: echo - 51% wipe shame :P
[3:34:40] Wildside1177: Wasn't heroic Ragnaros almost 20 min in firelands.
[3:34:43] SicDogg: method best ?
[3:34:47] BeeMazed: You make fight Mecha-Sylvanas after 50%
[3:34:54] NOHITJEROME: isnt 51% a lot to go though or does the fight not have any more mechanics
[3:34:59] CritcobainTV: 2
[3:35:01] 3663Sharad: 2 Dead
[3:35:02] Felrane: 2 i think
[3:35:05] tadeeche: not till the very end
[3:35:08] Sayryn: Yeah, but Echo went from 60 to almost dead
[3:35:18] Ezekyler: it was their best attempt, never get under 60%
[3:35:24] Nardap: 51% does leave room for some mechanic though?
[3:35:59] Drogdorf: all alive to last platform
[3:36:03] MOLAR305: they were at 55 with 20 up

[3:36:07] Dagomarus: it wasnt even 2% it was 1.21
[3:36:10] ShrenTheOrc: they used like all 3 on platforms
[3:36:31] konmenos: when was last time a tier raid ended in the first week?
[3:36:34] Ezekyler: Sylvanas raid damage is relentless, a lot of pressure on healers @Towelliee
[3:36:45] mrelgaato: 1.71% for Echo
[3:37:05] NOHITJEROME: i would hate to be a healer on this fight
[3:37:13] NOHITJEROME: id also hate to be a tank on any mythic fight
[3:37:14] Dagomarus: yeah you just cant have this many dead
[3:37:23] Dagomarus: you literally need everyone
[3:37:24] Lintgamer: So what are you thoughts that the raid is going to be cleared this fast? @Towelliee
[3:37:24] Nardap: is it a execution issue or a gear issue or both?...maybe healers dont have the gear to keep the heals going
[3:37:34] ShrenTheOrc: echo is on point man
[3:37:38] roogar1234: what should i look for at the launch of new world chat?
[3:37:39] maalow: They hit enrage with under 2% left
[3:37:50] Dagomarus: If echo stop, Limit will take this
[3:38:00] 3663Sharad: Echo must be salted as hell
[3:39:46] Nardap: its kinda hard to say @roogar1234 since first the game was supposed to be mainly pvp based but they switched it to a more pve based mmo last year...now they have added more dungeons and story based content i think
[3:40:11] Nardap: i still think the fighting over regions will be a major feature
[3:41:59] Norcore: @Nardap do you mean in New World?
[3:42:19] cyclonos: scripe scheming a plan

[3:45:37] valth: echo will take it i think
[3:45:43] Nardap: in how many days?
[3:45:43] maalow: that was pull 100
[3:45:49] Glisur85: cool
[3:45:55] D3m0nHunt3r666: It's in the bad
[3:45:57] D3m0nHunt3r666: bag*
[3:45:58] Norcore: @Glisur85 they are all the same server and they will play against each other, Syndicate Vs Marauders Vs Covenant
[3:46:12] Sir_KnightErrant: did they say what the server cap will be @Towelliee. Do you think that with all those creators on one server it will be flooded?
[3:46:14] dsdub: the guild sloot is in is doing very well i just realized
[3:46:45] Drogdorf: Imagine if its a troll and she acually goes to 40% on mythic LUL

[3:47:29] jason_shade: im not mentally prepared for them to kill sylvanas today(at 50%) because it will mean that this tier was extremely disappointing with the last half cheese. I thought for sure once i saw painsmith that they were making a grinder. I'm not sure what happens to the game if this is a pushover tier
[3:47:59] Moonphire: Echo out here on fire this tier
[3:48:09] Gloine2264: Gloine2264 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! hi
[3:48:23] Pamito: BDGG gonna come in and steal it Kappa
[3:48:31] Nardap: well on the other hand wow has been around a long time now with tens and tens of raid bosses...people have experience of killing bosses with varied tactics
[3:48:56] jason_shade: yeah, and it suggests that they didn't intend to make that boss that hard, from what i've seen of the other 3
[3:48:59] konmenos: have the rwf raider became too good?
[3:49:00] lithium364: big surprise, mythic sylvanas lasts till 1% 35 min fight, this is what blizzard meant when they described the encounter as epic
[3:49:04] jason_shade: 4 really, if we assume sylvanas is about to die
[3:49:41] Felrane: we all quit
[3:49:42] D3m0nHunt3r666: welp its the patch
[3:49:52] Glisur85: The hype died after everybody was able to despawn mechanics on KT
[3:49:54] jason_shade: i can tell you from advertising for raid sales that the population is gone
[3:50:00] Apokolipz: the world is on vacation
[3:50:04] GuineaChop: Its just so many people split in streams - almost all the raiders are streaming their POV
[3:50:05] Arinoras: summer time
[3:50:07] Moonphire: very good point towel
[3:50:09] lithium364: my realmpool died no guild even has 8/10 heroic :( :(
[3:50:09] Eraste: blizz still digging that hole and dont wanna come out
[3:50:10] Sephirothxz: Summer time
[3:50:10] ChgChg1: Raids aren't new and exciting anymore. At a point it's just another boss.
[3:50:11] Scoodles91: well the patch was like 2 months late :D, kinda expected
[3:50:16] hardcorl: and asmongold has 100k play ff online
[3:50:17] ElDrakenMan: why doesnt blizzard hype up WFR? They should stream it like the mytic plus stuff they do
[3:50:17] migzony: ppl are watching Ging's stream
[3:50:18] sluggin6780: I’m just watching her boobs
[3:50:33] CriticalPhil: State of the game though people lost faith in shadowlands a while back
[3:50:35] Nardap: wow is suffering from self inflicted wounds atm i think
[3:50:44] Catspaw66: If Sylvannas actually died for reals in this raid it'd get more viewers I believe.
[3:50:58] Drogdorf: everyone is on the FF14 train atm
[3:51:02] Wildside1177: The raid is not as good as CN by far.
[3:51:05] crashoverride_gaming: so just got new world deluxe addition. so what server we going on hammer squad?

[3:51:16] D3m0nHunt3r666: ^^^
[3:51:18] MrKhanes: I think its because of how ppl feel about wow right now.
[3:51:19] lithium364: also its summer and covid lifted in most countrys
[3:51:29] Moonphire: How many more attemtps before Echo goes to bed
[3:51:37] crashoverride_gaming: Thank you :)
[3:51:51] ohnot___her: IMO, Echo goes to bed w/o killing, limit wins
[3:51:58] kharnij83: CN was also during the pandemi crap so more people stuck home
[3:52:11] Wildside1177: Towelliee I am going to try to tank in NW. Teach me how!
[3:52:14] mrsuflakis: They undertuned the bosses so its less fun
[3:52:23] Felrane: I haven't actually watched any of the race this time
[3:52:23] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:52:25] westpanda: That’s what I said yesterday when 4 raids were first pulling Her like all top 4 guilds were pulling her roughly same time for first time and WoW was like #7 on games behind like minecraft lol @towelliee

[3:52:48] jason_shade: they been raiding since i woke up so like 8 hours or so?
[3:52:55] MrKhanes: Its just 9 pm in europe. So they will defintly do more hours
[3:52:57] slatester: they said they're not going to bed until she dies
[3:52:59] Moonphire: Time to pop the adderal and gfuel
[3:53:02] Ezekyler: 61%
[3:53:11] kuiper_ow: @Towelliee are you watching ROSHTEIN? :D
[3:53:17] ohnot___her: I dont think lunch was the move either

[3:54:11] Moonphire: Those guys are their 1k spins lol
[3:54:14] Kinghorn: think they are just buying up AHs?
[3:54:20] Kinghorn: getting gear
[3:54:22] Sch1ey: scripted

[3:54:39] Glisur85: They are building the anticipation
[3:54:41] Waspire: have you tried the high limit coin pushers ?
[3:54:42] BoatLoadsofDope: wonder how much debt thwy
[3:54:46] daniel85mg: Crazy they just pause after a pull like that
[3:54:52] jason_shade: they said they were going to try to find some more damage
[3:54:58] jason_shade: so AH etc yeah
[3:54:58] BoatLoadsofDope: going to go into this raid LUL
[3:54:58] Nardap: maybe they want to give the people a break so they can get more focused
[3:55:11] Moonphire: Just get an apt in Van 4Head

[3:55:20] Waspire: look it up on you tube
[3:55:20] GodKingMuninn: buy the AH duh
[3:55:31] Waspire: its in vegas
[3:55:45] Felrane: boe should just not drop till mythic is cleared on your server ;p
[3:56:00] westpanda: 2% is a lot on her it’s not 2% of like normal boss it’s more close to 5% consider she “dies” at 50%
[3:56:04] jason_shade: you better save up that 500k for when andy dalton starts in september
[3:56:21] Kinghorn: LUL
[3:56:28] Rottencoarse: @Jason_Shade LOL
[3:56:29] beejayWL: 3 games now
[3:56:30] ixianprince: @thenextmartian they were 3,6% off
[3:56:30] dinomiyte: maybe it dosent end at 50%
[3:56:32] Moonphire: There's a preseason, it's 1 less game than normal
[3:56:41] Moonphire: Cause of the longer reg season
[3:56:49] jason_shade: LUL
[3:57:03] chessboxin34: preseason, a good measuring stick for qb success lmao
[3:57:03] beejayWL: that would be nice but knowing the bears they will run dalton out anyway in regular season
[3:57:07] SGT_SlapChop: Dalton will be day 1 starter
[3:57:24] westpanda: Yeah idk where they get the extra dmg tbh that was like a perfect pull til last platform they had one tank death on platform 3 I think and that was it like it doesn’t get more perfect and still off pretty good on dmg
[3:57:33] daniel85mg: Roger seems like a great funny dude
[3:58:51] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee scripe and roger tend to overthink things
[3:59:01] Rottencoarse: thats one of the reasons they lost the nylotha race
[3:59:02] westpanda: Yeah but they have to do a perfect pull again and hope that boes pulls 4-5% more dmg cause 2% HP is more then 2% on her
[3:59:13] jason_shade: limit's on lunch
[3:59:14] westpanda: I mean they can do it but they need a perfect pull 0 deaths against
[3:59:16] westpanda: Again
[3:59:44] nightmayor12: BoE's destroyed nyalotha
[4:00:30] BigLoe: push more
[4:00:41] westpanda: Method is gonna sleep and wake up and steal the kill KEKW
[4:01:04] Theduskflyer: 75 hours lol
[4:01:10] mavericks312: what's limits best pull?
[4:01:14] ohnot___her: What was the cheese in KT?
[4:01:19] Glisur85: lol some good copy pasta yesterday
[4:01:25] Eraste: "we had to interrupt and stay out of the red circle. you cant compete now days" KEKW
[4:01:32] 6thBama: 1422223

[4:02:18] hardcorl: limits best 61,73
[4:02:21] SavageCheez: Probably updating addons
[4:02:29] ShrenTheOrc: the ads a real
[4:02:36] Norcore: @fistothefistybot but which one, isn't he in classic and shadowlands too?
[4:02:36] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:02:43] slatester: they also restart to fix lag issues with the fight
[4:02:45] westpanda: I think there is some merit to killing bosses on BC and wotlk first because the raiders were not paid/ pulling 15 hours a day for weeks straight or have 8292920 million gold and viewers trading gear etc
[4:02:53] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[4:02:58] tadeeche: odds both guilds kill on same pull?
[4:02:59] CritcobainTV: true
[4:03:08] westpanda: Different times but don’t think those kills were push overs
[4:03:13] jason_shade: limit's pulling
[4:03:21] Catspaw66: BDGG and method are neck adn neck on progress and pulls. both at 83%
[4:03:28] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee limit is pulling
[4:03:33] gwar234: you know if they don't like adds they could use an amazon prime?!?!?! lol
[4:03:40] slatester: I think weakauras have gotten too sophisticated

[4:04:17] Drogdorf: I miss Paragon
[4:04:20] Nardap: wasnt the idea of hardcore raiding that they didnt use too many addons?
[4:04:25] The_Hollow_Man: just imagine blizzard doing this today, the shit storm they would get
[4:04:33] MOLAR305: in vanilla we had a 2 hour window for vael, if it ended you had to wait 8 hours
[4:04:45] jason_shade: normal time so 630 PST
[4:04:59] shawnmsmall35: is this Mythic Sylvanas?
[4:05:03] Norcore: @slatester i think addons and macros in general make the game way easier
[4:05:45] Nardap: though this is 100 attempts...which is still quite a lot...no normal guild does that many in a limited time frame
[4:06:03] Glisur85: How wild would it be if they both killed it this pull
[4:06:08] Nardap: only takes a few deaths for setback

[5:00:39] N3llee: literally pull by pull % by %
[5:00:39] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee Meanwhile at Blizzard HQ: Dev1: Did you enabled the percantage thrashhold for mythic Syvlanas? Dev2: The what? LUL
[5:00:41] NOHITJEROME: @Ajssi hello how are you today?
[5:00:41] Arinos90: dumb question, does the fight end at 50%?
[5:00:42] daniel85mg: no way it doesn't die today
[5:00:49] NOHITJEROME: it better end at 50% or people gonna riot LUL

[5:01:58] Mr_Hasselhoff: I chose to believe there is a secret phase
[5:02:03] Masqerader: 25m enrage timer and a secret phase? I don't see it
[5:02:04] Sollice: If there is a secret phase I am sure the two guilds will be PISSED lol
[5:02:07] Dkgungo: max thinks they can get her to sub 60 before last platform
[5:02:10] Ezekyler: more BoE Kappa
[5:02:11] Dagomarus: true its 50% or reset
[5:02:18] Masqerader: or w/e it was
[5:02:21] bdna2: 50% is where she dies on heroic and normal?
[5:02:39] foxies_havocing: hero went off thats why :D
[5:02:40] NOHITJEROME: ya i agree
[5:02:46] Zavier420: Maybe at 50% she goes super saiyan
[5:02:48] daniel85mg: yep
[5:02:51] Dagomarus: probably saving their cooldowns for lust on final platform
[5:02:51] N3llee: Limits dps is way higher and Echos healing is way better
[5:03:01] Norcore: yeah but what's the point of higher dps if they don't dodge spells
[5:03:02] Rudric_Ice: only thing is limit is dying
[5:03:02] mrkenndy: @Towelliee yes i think its cause the druids go heals at certain spots with the volume of boomkins
[5:03:28] CritcobainTV: Just send echos healers to limit and it's an EZ GG KEKW
[5:03:44] Rottencoarse: @Critcobain lol
[5:03:44] deja_foo: Wait… so the fight ends at 50% and not 0%?
[5:03:44] Rudric_Ice: limit is GO GO GO and echo is calm and submissive
[5:04:03] Sollice: They are healing struggling P2 for sure
[5:04:06] XLTooTall: is there not a mythic aura that gets applied at 45 percent or is that incorrect info datamined @Towelliee
[5:04:06] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:04:15] nightmayor12: im pretty sure maeveys shaman is way more geared than his priest.
[5:04:23] daniel85mg: .... and suddenly hype is peaking again
[5:04:28] Kinghorn: fight ends on 19.8ish% on normal and heroic so Toots_Gaming
[5:04:30] Dagomarus: echos dps is better right now
[5:04:32] nightmayor12: and Zaelia is maining priest for this tier on echo
[5:04:33] Kinghorn: 49.8
[5:04:36] Kinghorn: my bad
[5:04:47] UzarhFPS: @Towelliee echo just had a 0.25% wipe
[5:04:50] Rudric_Ice: LUL
[5:04:56] Dagomarus: get lulas dinner ready, shes coming home
[5:04:57] Jimbobaus: Yes 50% on normal and heroic. In the ptr Sylvanas has a spell aura that is 50 normal and 45 mythic so there is a rumour she might be 45% mythic but it’s believed it will be 50% still. This race is so exiting compared to others.
[5:04:59] FranciscoTheMage: dang that sucks.. she's done a great job
[5:05:05] daniel85mg: Pretty sure both Limit pallies are mains, not sure about priests
[5:05:20] ChiefMango: @Towelliee what's your prog in the raid?
[5:05:20] Sollice: Her coming home early is a good thing
[5:05:21] NOHITJEROME: if limit take this itd be wild

[5:06:14] CritcobainTV: its targeted
[5:06:17] Dagomarus: its not 2nd phase thats the problem
[5:06:17] NOHITJEROME: people do not get topped up fast
[5:06:18] CritcobainTV: i think
[5:06:23] Dagomarus: its the 3rd thats limits weakness
[5:06:36] Hitmanblood: lets go LIMIT!
[5:06:40] iseenoobpeoplee: Kappa

[5:22:11] Wulfgrym: How does Max think they can kill it at 45% this week?????
[5:22:14] prof_history: dont think 45 is doable until reset. in which case NA gets a day advantage
[5:22:14] Galadeon: 45% will require a reset, and NA gets a headstart
[5:22:15] requlim: SylvanasJAM towQueen
[5:22:17] Aidler: but that's entirely on Blizz. that's how I see it
[5:22:18] Arocian: Raid Team: What is the Percent? Blizzard: Please check a Fan Website.

[5:22:36] 3663Sharad: Scripe wants to do some math @Towelliee
[5:22:36] laaxxxd: Limit about to do normal runs
[5:22:37] zgag: That what makes it a WF race. Would be bad for Blizzard to give them inside info.
[5:22:43] Crashmobber: how do they even know that its for sure 45%?
[5:22:46] Nightshaft25: ION like "you dont know when sylvannas is dead"
[5:22:50] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee limit is going to do splits rn
[5:22:50] bgriff87: towOof
[5:22:51] ZuluAnimal: I love it frim Blizz

[5:22:57] chrslp: @Crashmobber Datamined info
[5:22:58] mrshooky: told u theres a secret phase
[5:23:04] Brenndon: I don't wanna sound salty, but this is soo cheese. Echo gets boss to 49.5% > Limit stops and goes splits. If echo didnt get boss to that % limit would never know....
[5:23:06] FranciscoTheMage: WHY on EARTH would anyone THINK the heroic death percentage would be the same
[5:23:07] Teitanblood: 45 is not confirmed though. Could be 40
[5:23:09] rymerre: lol these adult cry babies
[5:23:12] Wulfgrym: Ion is just going to say Git Gud
[5:23:13] chrslp: There was a rumor of it being datamined that she's 45%
[5:23:15] tadeeche: wonder if it was cause she was casting?
[5:23:17] bigblue02005: 0 percent kill
[5:23:19] Ajssi: @Towelliee its too much 4.5%
[5:23:21] zephirozz: Could it be 0.07 off?
[5:23:27] sinlesssinner: @Layercake with the same gear today Limit couldnt keep up with echo tho... so yea its not all gear
[5:23:28] s1cKNation: Aster will come out of nowhere to win the race Jebaited secret tactics Jebaited
[5:23:30] RockemSockem0821: echo's chat is crying about blizzard lol
[5:23:30] slatester: there's no way they get another 5% without more gear
[5:23:31] Nightshaft25: @Brenndon yeap thats a true fact
[5:23:35] prof_history: wild card, you gotta get her to 0%. FF14 looking REAL good now lol
[5:23:41] HotHotHeals: here come the tweets
[5:23:44] Arocian: maybe they were .001 off

[5:24:12] NOHITJEROME: aster getting this win would be hilarious
[5:24:25] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee why is it called complexity and also called limit
[5:24:27] CADZtv: yh they literally thought they killed it
[5:24:27] Nightshaft25: Nice one
[5:24:29] nightmayor12: lula going to be in texas for another week LUL
[5:24:31] Dagomarus: echo is far more consistant
[5:24:32] Masqerader: They assumed and assumed wrong
[5:24:42] ChiefMango: @FranciscoTHEmage Eh, why not? it's not like she's got the same health numbers. And more mechanics. It would be perfectly normal to assume same % end.
[5:24:45] Arocian: Next week, we found a bug with the percentage for kill and have patched a fix
[5:24:54] swampt1l: Limit is guild name and Complexity is the org @franciscothemage

[5:26:24] CGd0c: scripe said 45 on his stream
[5:26:28] ZuluAnimal: its a strange one
[5:26:29] FranciscoTheMage: @Daismoon thats what im saying when did blizz ever say 50
[5:26:37] ChiefMango: 1.1% in relative to the 45% i guess
[5:26:39] Rio_duh: Blizzard dont have to tell them anything. Figure it out
[5:26:41] FranciscoTheMage: and why should they reveal it?
[5:26:41] zgag: No. No way that info should be shared
[5:26:41] 3663Sharad: They take a break
[5:26:42] KingofMeccano: im not suprised its not 50% tbh cause as that is only for heroic blizzard would definalty not want to make it that easy for mythic so i would so 40-45% to keep it interesting
[5:26:44] Ezekyler: yes
[5:26:45] sinlesssinner: u know what even Blizzard doesnt know when she dies
[5:26:47] Masqerader: They won't be able to get that dps
[5:27:07] Panadol324: below 49% anduin is targetable and Secret faze starts
[5:27:11] Ezekyler: Limit is over too, no point to keep trying
[5:27:19] Rippan: if its 45%, they wont hit that before reset Sadge
[5:27:20] Noiseeater: is limit going?
[5:27:25] zgag: Echo should have to decide on what they want to do w/o help from Blizzard
[5:27:26] genks1337: Lol they are asking if 3 healing is possible
[5:27:28] Kinghorn: towQueen burn the hype!
[5:27:30] royhandlesit: Mythic Sylvannas is skynet
[5:27:30] FranciscoTheMage: False hope. Bravado. HUBRIS
[5:27:31] loktar_ogars: @Panadol324 really?
[5:27:33] sinlesssinner: @Panadol324 did u notice that too? cause i saw him in mid platform moving...
[5:27:33] NOHITJEROME: is there gear they could get before reset that could get them 4% more?
[5:27:35] kokochris: how do you kill that which has no life towQueen
[5:27:35] santamex: that shit would have tilted me so hard, would just go to bed
[5:27:40] slatester: some of the echo players are saying they have nothing left to upgrade
[5:27:41] CADZtv: echo talking about being a lil more agressive with their druids
[5:27:43] mavericks312: imagine what this does to echos psyche though
[5:27:46] loktar_ogars: i saw aundin too
[5:27:49] Daismoon: Everyone says they should have told them...NO
[5:27:54] Rudric_Ice: guess they aint sleepin lol
[5:27:54] telepaatti: 4% is seems way too much
[5:27:55] MOLAR305: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6myQLRWQAMfo99?format=jpg&name=large
[5:27:56] Wulfgrym: This is the secret phase bois
[5:28:00] sinlesssinner: so i wasnt the only one, Anduin does do something at 50%
[5:28:01] zgag: It would taint the WF race if Blizzard told them the %
[5:28:01] tadeeche: this tier did not make up for the content drought
[5:28:02] prof_history: 50-45% secret mythic unsub to our game phase. pretty legit
[5:28:02] Norcore: @NOHITJEROME not before reset i think
[5:28:07] Holysal: everyone wanted a special mythic phase now they hate it lol
[5:28:10] CADZtv: alot of echo druid were off healing
[5:28:17] Wulfgrym: @exaxis_painting exact
[5:28:21] 05_Scubaskot: buy some more BOEs 4Head
[5:28:24] Masqerader: Obi Wan be like... EU got Alderaan'd
[5:28:26] Panadol324: if Thatcher realy True ten wow devs just f.... everyone:)
[5:28:26] FranciscoTheMage: it might be a secret phase with some dodging healing and stuff. and she eventually dies
[5:28:34] Rippan: @Holysal there is no secret phase, it just require more dmg.

[5:28:45] Rio_duh: Blizzard dont have to tell them anything. Figure it out
[5:28:48] ChiefMango: they don't need to say %, only confirm it's not 50% like Hc. wouldn't taint anything. just confirming it's not a bug
[5:28:48] bgriff87: LUL
[5:28:51] Wulfgrym: Blizzard dev's probably don't know when she dies, can't answer the question
[5:28:56] FranciscoTheMage: @Rio_duh I AGREE
[5:29:14] rilsolo: yea
[5:29:14] kokochris: ya just confirm they didn't get it. no harm
[5:29:23] chrslp: I do agree tbh. Its frustrating but you cant be mad at Blizz. Everyone just assumed it was 50%

[5:29:55] FranciscoTheMage: Not a BUG
[5:29:56] Holysal: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=359430/sylvanas
[5:29:59] zgag: Blizzard can tell them that why they got to was intended. That's all they need to say
[5:30:00] bgriff87: YEP
[5:30:01] lithium364: atleast they can enjoy the food for one more week
[5:30:05] Sollice: I would imagine if Limit is doing splits that means they are going to keep continuing. I would assume at this point they probably know its 45%
[5:30:06] zgag: where *
[5:30:07] bgriff87: Just a yes or no
[5:30:08] prof_history: its just shitty that if it is 45% NA almost 100% wins. they will have a day advantage to the reset
[5:30:12] ChiefMango: that patch note update does not confirm it's 45% on mythic xD it just means she has 5% less health in HC then before nerf.
[5:30:17] CADZtv: limit has the advantage now honestly
[5:30:22] Nokterian: Not a bug but a feature
[5:30:22] CADZtv: huge
[5:30:23] nightmayor12: This is so fitting for this patch haha
[5:30:25] Nokterian: LUL
[5:30:30] Rippan: yeah
[5:30:32] Norcore: yeah...
[5:30:33] Brenndon: 3 healers @Towelliee ? :D:D:D
[5:30:35] HotHotHeals: is blizzard involved in any of these RWF events?
[5:30:36] nightmayor12: no communication on blizzard yet again
[5:30:37] Holysal: @exaxis_painting yep it does. hope for a global release but doubt it
[5:30:38] thecynicalshuffler: just gotta git gud... thats all lol
[5:30:40] FranciscoTheMage: Hereeee come the CHINESE team
[5:30:45] tadeeche: didnt they do heroic splits already
[5:30:48] rilsolo: max just said its doable to get 45% just very hard
[5:30:51] jinnchu: Max keeps saying he thinks its still kill-able at 45%
[5:30:52] sorrel_n: Limit just said they can probably do it without a reset
[5:30:57] bgriff87: Whats Limits best attempt %?
[5:30:58] zSKIz1: what are you drinking?
[5:31:02] Daismoon: Do the math....See if they can get 45%
[5:31:02] zgag: Sco going to come in and take WF now
[5:31:08] lithium364: imagine they go for splits next week and painsmith gets buffed in hotfix LUL
[5:31:09] garkhyt: Nope not a bug, then BOSS call Devs and instruct a hotfix release and make it 45% GG
[5:31:11] sinlesssinner: @jinnchu they didnt even get to 50 lol
[5:31:12] Rippan: Echo did the math.. and they dont think so LUL
[5:31:16] Rudric_Ice: those 40 raiders didnt work out for aster LUL
[5:31:17] mrkenndy: @Towelliee i think unless i mathed wrong they need to find 5.94m more damage over the fight
[5:31:23] officialviz: @Rippan Theres no math to be done lol.
[5:31:23] wildcat_19: need more boomkins
[5:31:23] Ezekyler: @Towelliee https://imgflip.com/i/5gwdpc
[5:31:25] Yosbo: @sorrel_n yet na cant get below 60%

[5:31:49] 05_Scubaskot: Brah, Kungen is already in the next Xpac @Towelliee
[5:31:58] chrslp: One of their boomkins did 1m+ damage less than #1 damage
[5:31:59] memnon94: so limit stopped as well or what ?
[5:32:00] CADZtv: FAX kungen beat newworld wdym tow
[5:32:00] dracullus: Kungen would take Sylvanas to 0%
[5:32:01] sinlesssinner: @jinnchu thats even worse tho :p
[5:32:01] Rudric_Ice: Kungen already started progressing for 9.3 raid
[5:32:02] bigblue02005: Kungen has finished 6.0 in FF14 already
[5:32:03] kokochris: he is on 10.0 right now
[5:32:04] Rippan: officialviz ofc there is, you calculate the max dmg you as a guild can produce with the current gear.. its not rocket science
[5:32:04] swampt1l: Kungen soloed Sylvannas btw
[5:32:04] Sollice: Kungen killed all of the first ones
[5:32:04] sorrel_n: Kungen proving 10.0 raids killable for Blizzard testers
[5:32:05] SinanUnver: I love Kungen man ! hahaha so funny AF

[5:34:15] FranciscoTheMage: what are the specs on all their pcs have they released that info
[5:34:18] Sollice: None of this crap Blizzard conspiracy theory NA crap
[5:34:27] chrslp: Do they have all 25 at that place or is it just a core group?
[5:34:28] kokochris: @sollice towTinfoil
[5:34:29] Rudric_Ice: so are we sure she dies at 45 percent now ?
[5:34:34] DragonofWolves: Get em sollice
[5:34:36] mavericks312: like I said tho the race is now limits to lose
[5:34:37] mrkenndy: @Rudi_Ice nope lol
[5:34:38] kokochris: no we ain't sure
[5:34:50] Pamito: @sollice, its an NA conspiracy KKona
[5:35:01] Galadeon: If it is 45%, this will also let BDG and Method catch up also.
[5:35:11] Yosbo: A reset needed to kill sylv would mean na gets the wf handed to them tbh
[5:35:13] Sollice: I am conspiring with myself to purge dumb conspiracy messages
[5:35:19] Sollice: No need
[5:35:21] sinlesssinner: @Towelliee so u think everyone else on Sylvanas Mythic should stop doing attempts right?
[5:35:23] chrslp: LUL
[5:35:24] Sollice: That was easy :)
[5:35:28] ZippoIsFreeFromJail: Bdg and Method not gona carch up i till thursday or friday

[5:35:35] audderd: audderd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 19 month streak! 
[5:35:36] Bakuryuha96: @Sollice Dude you make my day so much lmao
[5:35:39] slatester: the last second hotfix shows how poorly they tuned this raid originally
[5:35:42] sinlesssinner: i see , yea u are right
[5:35:42] Masqerader: Paragon gonna come out of retirement and take it
[5:35:46] MOLAR305: well this will definitely make it easier if you wait for reset
[5:35:54] Zippaya: limit was there, so this knowlege is so important for them
[5:35:56] mrkenndy: @sinlesssinner can echo or limit find 5.94 mill damage over the fight? thtas the issue
[5:35:56] royhandlesit: echo casters taking it real hard
[5:36:03] Hypertitan: it's crazy to me that sco has pulled method back to where they are...i've been pretty impressed with how well they've done this teir
[5:36:04] 91Niki: Why delete when you can ban ?
[5:36:07] Birder_L: dumb question sorry, what does reset have to do with it? gear?

[5:36:13] Wulfgrym: Shade is going to sneak in and take the title
[5:36:14] zgag: Blizzard really needs to be very careful on what they say. Echo should have to make a call based off the notion that the % they got to was intended. Nothing more
[5:36:14] akia03: so pvp rogues now?
[5:36:14] Rippan: Nihilum!
[5:36:18] Masqerader: Say one thing about this race, it's been the best and closest in terms of multiple guilds on the last boss at one time
