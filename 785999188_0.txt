[4:33:20] Yochimo: Ok I've never played wow in my life, like ever, what the heck is going on lol
[4:33:44] hotgamermilk: @Yochimo there is a mechanic where you need 3 tanks, but they are only using 2
[4:33:45] ShouldveRolled: o the reason stores can play music is they r playing it from a source that already has permission to play it publically
[4:33:56] cabbagesz: @jakenbakeLIVE they said its not shut down, but be carefull if you drive up bc cops are waiting to ticket
[4:34:02] Yochimo: Oooooh
[4:34:04] ShouldveRolled: which doesnt make sense if they dmca him for walking by a store
[4:34:11] silverlobo: thats cool

[4:36:06] lazerlemons: what type of tank has the highest avoidance now?
[4:36:29] hawkthethird: apparently when napter first came out it was within the law and then they rewrote copy right law to make it illegal or whatever
[4:36:33] hotgamermilk: NotLikeThis
[4:36:40] bobarooska: wubbyWax

[4:37:08] Clee_Torrees: I don't think twitch will actually perms ban big streamers for this, probably going to change policy first
[4:37:12] SteeIFire88: What happened m8?
[4:37:17] vodloser: WAYTOODANK
[4:37:22] hottopicemployee: WAYTOODANK
[4:37:33] hotgamermilk: @Griznar it's out of twitch's hands, it's a legal thing
[4:37:38] hawkthethird: I mean they banned doc for whatever reason and he raked in the money
[4:37:47] Foular: Tbh even if they figure out the strat they won't clear this. The tuning just isn't right.
[4:37:55] Mythlor: LULW
[4:37:59] Clee_Torrees: @cashcatt the perms ban for 3 strike policy is from twitch

[4:38:20] sparic: twitch will do what gives them the least liability
[4:38:21] Athanas2221: PepeLaugh
[4:38:45] hotgamermilk: @Griznar yes but if someone is "breaking the law" and they don't ban them, twitch goes down
[4:38:45] SteeIFire88: Guys What did Jake F with?
[4:39:29] hotgamermilk: doesn't matter if it's 3 strikes or whatever. They could 100% HELP the streamer out by giving them resources and tools, but whether or not they ban someone based on the DMCA is beyond them @Griznar
[4:39:36] hawkthethird: does section 230 not protect twitch in this case?
[4:39:38] kuramaahhnl: DansGame
[4:39:50] hawkthethird: content users post the site isnt liable for
[4:40:04] Alectryon: slimes going to kill patch before this raid
[4:40:17] ShouldveRolled: i believe they r not liable but they have to take the content down
[4:40:18] hotgamermilk: twitch has to take reasonable action to prevent the user from posting it
[4:40:21] GreenyScott: LMFAO

[5:45:57] PataGUCCiCarry: im really curious what twitch will do about all this. Such a negative impact on the platform and experience
[5:45:59] GreenyScott: @EVADcobra1 apparently not enough
[5:46:00] vodloser: Sadge
[5:46:03] SaneSci: make an archive channel and upload them all in there?

[5:46:08] throbbin_bowls: Sadge
[5:46:14] vodloser: chat will cover some of the video tho

[5:46:53] FCLiver: @ShouldveRolled i mean it takes me a couple of days to finish one
[5:46:53] gritz_n_pitz: @jakenbakeLIVE youre gonna have to put the YT link in youre About page
[5:46:58] PataGUCCiCarry: like amazon can do this, they have the capacity
[5:47:05] treboniann: i would be bummed tbh if you deleted all the vods. ISNT TWITCHES CEO AN ENGINEER TYPE GUY holy fuck what is he doing... this shit is soooo poorly run its pathetic
[5:47:05] Bullet_Drifter: ya they don't have this problem. FB gaming LULW
[5:47:06] SaneSci: What
[5:47:07] GreenyScott: and as long as the chat has timestamps, it'll be possible to sync it up with vods
[5:47:13] efthimi0s: they dont do it because they think they can get away with not doing it
[5:47:13] ShouldveRolled: it costs money
[5:47:16] evadcobra1: watch twitch does this after u delete everything
[5:47:18] SaneSci: What is the point of media share if it might cause you to get DMCA? *
[5:47:18] efthimi0s: being the #1 paltform etc
[5:47:25] hirengames: i dont think twitch can do this. amazon owns twitch. so i think its all up to amazon
[5:47:28] REVitRevy: @trebonianlive being an engineer isnt related to the problems that have
[5:47:42] Dj_Bobby_G: Twitch would have to pay for so many streamers and licenses
[5:47:50] gritz_n_pitz: money its always money @jakenbakeLIVE
[5:47:58] Dj_Bobby_G: Not many Facebook streamers
[5:48:06] Bullet_Drifter: its all done by UMG universal music group. its 45 billion dollar company Vs Twitch which is like 1 billion LUL
[5:48:07] GreenyScott: yeah that wont happen lol
[5:48:19] taketimebekind: The law needs to catch up to 2020
[5:48:20] Suicidalsnail69: For as many ads they’ve been showing they could pay for it LUL
[5:48:21] treboniann: @zeroto_tuu hes a tech engineer tho... he makes systems that handle these kinds of things... twitch is engineered so poorly. but ya its also legal issues...
[5:48:28] LayWastedd: LETS BAN OUR USERS INSTEAD. FUCK IT. gachiHYPER - twitch probably
[5:48:32] sotif: $$$
[5:48:32] SaneSci: Facebook probably has more advertising power too, which is a good leverage

[5:49:03] Bullet_Drifter: Talk to Devin Nash. he knows this shit.
[5:49:04] TrueDrag0n: Goodluck getting a response back from Twitch. I never got one. Sadge
[5:49:07] teknotranz: everything started with DOJ suing Google weeks ago.. all other tech companies in the valley are just doing house cleaning..
[5:49:10] FCLiver: @dium gad damn LUL
[5:49:11] PataGUCCiCarry: do you have a designated partner relations manager at twitch you can talk to? @jakenbakeLIVE
[5:49:16] taketimebekind: @bullet_drifter he did
[5:49:17] REVitRevy: @trebonianlive i think its lazy to just force everyone to delete; but then again they shouldnt handle each persons videos.
[5:49:29] Athanas2221: i firmly believe twitch is devolving
[5:49:37] boeuf: twitch's 3 strike rule is archaic
[5:49:44] TrueDrag0n: I need a summon.
[5:49:51] treboniann: @zeroto_tuu ya they have had years and years to design systems to help streamers clean up their directories but they havent done anything. its wild.
[5:49:52] LayWastedd: @Athanas2221 not devolving. its just getting targeted since they are the biggest stream platform.
[5:49:53] Dloreh: the worst part about that is vods arent monetized like yt videos are
[5:49:59] ShouldveRolled: i think youtubes live streaming is better than twitches
[5:50:03] REVitRevy: the twitch vod ui is ass
[5:50:04] LayWastedd: people want a piece of that ad money pie @Athanas2221
[5:50:08] efthimi0s: just like dev companies...twitch getting worse after being bought out by a mega corp
[5:50:09] hamlife_: yea thats the worst imo the 3 strikes and they NEVER go away

[6:53:36] hirengames: it's not a mana issue?
[6:53:46] grillabiff: is there no mana tide anymore
[6:53:47] lazerlemons: Melee need to run out when tanks die
[6:53:48] dium: theoretically, the melee should not be dying because hateful strike hits the first three targets on his threat table
[6:53:50] shreksgooch: tell qt stop overhealing and he will have mana
[6:53:51] klondikebruh: @jakenbakeLIVE Does moon know he can soothe the enrage?
[6:53:53] dium: and those should be the tanks
[6:53:56] CallMeAyAyRon: @dium, are they able to use Greater Dreamless Sleep Potion ?
[6:53:59] lazerlemons: till third tank starts taking hatefuls
[6:53:59] grillabiff: save BL for execute
[6:54:00] dium: unsure
[6:54:00] resonantblue: the life of a healer
[6:54:12] KhazzakBFRPG: dium it's actually the highest health targets from what i remember
[6:54:15] emilpeace: logics..
[6:54:17] CallMeAyAyRon: @dium, I don't know if they are trash now, but I remember using that with Tank CDs back in vanilla
[6:54:19] dium: yes, that too
[6:54:21] ShouldveRolled: or be square

[6:54:41] resonantblue: def are
[6:54:42] CallMeAyAyRon: Yah, it's looking like tank table and health

[6:54:54] moji_joji: i obviously wouldnt expect him to play after project 30 but watching Jake play wow is actually pretty entertaining
[6:54:56] CallMeAyAyRon: because when a tank dies, it takes a bit for the them to catch back up
[6:55:00] CallMeAyAyRon: I thought they could still taunt
[6:55:03] CallMeAyAyRon: to get back up to the top
[6:55:08] BigTuckTV: jnbPog BEAT EU LETS GO
