[1:59:49] Lazurbeem: I'm just hoping the take out some of the bloat in the game.  It's getting to be too much when it doesn't have to be.
[1:59:52] conquestandvictory: People just expect WoW to be some phenomenal thing with no downsides. Its hard to please every spoiled minded individual on this earth
[2:00:28] valianya: Survival game genre is a growing market with no single best game to compete against like LoL killed HotS in competition.  I want to see what Blizzard puts together and how they innovate or change the genre with a survival game that seems to be fantasy, and possibly multi-world or isekai genre (modern person transported to other world)
[2:00:56] Raykuilu: which version u all prefer ? hc - wotlk or retail ?
[2:01:11] Jeshooa: I just want the story to be good thats literally all I care about personally
[2:01:13] Sicknessqt: Raids and dungeons are fine but we need some evergreen cool systems like player housing
[2:01:15] Rexy95: retail

[2:02:38] Duekov: Classic + could be new content :v
[2:03:13] conquestandvictory: The good thing about WoW is that is an ever living game, whatever people think of it. Like your account and characters grow and stay with the years. Its basically a nice place to hangout with. Games like League are just pointless fun without any progress inside
[2:03:26] denflup: I think classic is retail at this point, wotlk classic
[2:03:29] Respls: Classic+ is copium
[2:03:31] Thoreya: HC is just too slow paced for me I get bored easily. Cata + and retail will keep me engaged for a while

[2:03:47] wareagle07: A lot of people may not have been around for the old content so it's newish for them.
[2:03:57] khrownoes: So do you play classic for views or fan catering
[2:04:12] Kinghorn: LMAO

[2:06:34] WundertueteGER: Do you think they will make one of the shaman specs a support spec or a new shaman support spec?

[2:12:12] Rottencoarse: @jkitchin75 really?
[2:12:22] Eviltuna13: @legendarism you can upgrade to the 12 month and it will just add in the months
[2:12:24] Molvonos: Better incentivization for purchasing it.
[2:12:33] Zerfell: no thats included with each plan
[2:12:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: 6000

[2:12:44] jkitchin75: @legendarism 6 moth gets it too
[2:12:48] Rottencoarse: yeah 6k
[2:12:49] Zerfell: you get 500 with a 1month sub
[2:12:49] MoodyVanessa: i think the 500 tenders per month is what we already get montly
[2:12:50] KingDaDa1011: 6k

Doesn't seem to have even a TBA timeslot for Survival game s o likely only hear anything about it at Opening Ceremony.  But no ne of the usual Art or Music, or specific topic, or dev Q&A panels are listed this year.

[4:01:50] Molvonos: What sword?
[4:01:52] eviaz_: no they need to introduce new areas within those old zones. and maybe remaster the zones
[4:01:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: In theory they could add like another 500 devs to completely rework the whole game

I did a dungeon but was mostly in Ret gear (aside shield+weapon+trinkets) and I felt weak as hell. Is that cause of no Defense stat on gear? rotation was fine. Just not sure if gear was the factor of if thats just how prot is
[4:02:10] mavericks312: Dude what sword are y’all talking about

[4:05:52] mavericks312: @audiojaq how so traveling to azeroths soul is gonna be awesome
[4:05:56] valianya: Revamp a few zones at a time, bronze dragon lets you toggle to past or 'current' version.  Current version is updated to post Dragonflight, maybe with some max level quests or WQs that is side story content  updating the zone storyline.  Would feel more like a living world
[4:06:08] bypized: That would be the "reset" the reset is going to a different place
[4:06:12] mavericks312: Bro I’m ready to leave Azeroth behind
[4:06:53] Korupcija_: just put 2 next to "WoW" and people will be hype again
[4:07:01] AudioJaq: Lol it’ll be the same cycle of content. Nothing about retail can excite me anymore.

[4:13:04] abracka_: one page back
[4:13:06] valianya: Shadowlands basically was new mini planets as devs tried to excite players with cosmic stuff while failing to provide satisfying connection to Azeroth's characters and story.  Baine the sitting bull, Arthas disenchanted, useless Bolvar, everything Sylvanas, etc.  Devs tried cutting ties to Azeroth's storyline and it fell flat as The Nippler failed to interest anyone.

[4:17:22] Wcvechten: But what about the pirate storyline Kappa
[4:17:29] bypized: I think DFs story is better, but it misses to tell story beats and it leaves on assumptions
[4:17:32] coldhandsbeatz: A lot of ppl just hasnt done the main chunk of story. They were locked behind the renown tiers. Thats a silly design
[4:17:49] ProClicker: Legion was that last time I paid attention to the story. After that it went to shit
[4:17:54] coldhandsbeatz: The Tyr storyline is also all over the place. They should just have waited and put it all together
[4:18:02] mavericks312: @coldhandsbeatz you sneeze and you get renown

[4:18:35] belfastcl: most scientific research starts like that as well (what if X...)
[4:18:37] valianya: DF story is on rails unless you didn't follow it and started picking up quests randomly
[4:18:46] bypized: Yes, imo in this expac is too much where it leaves to nowhere. So I just think we will get to another WHAT SWORD... I can be wrong :)

[4:19:33] Quikbeard: found the asmon watcher
[4:19:38] devilhawk83: DF’s storyline is fine, not as good as Legion’s but it is still decent. There are games that got far worse storylines that makes you want to say “wtf were they thinking about and push it out”
[4:19:38] Quikbeard: "disney as fuck"
[4:19:39] oradros: fyrrak is a mini sargeras

[4:23:16] Z3ROR: Towel, what do you think is the most Warcraft thing they did in DF?
[4:23:18] MackPlays: Marvel is Disney
[4:23:20] Molvonos: The story makes perfect sense to people who have the capacity functionally read.
[4:23:24] kriegs77: How dare you sir! calling ppl out for having no opinion of their own, im so madge imma go watch asmon and see what he thinks about this outrageous discrimination

[4:24:06] funviking99: You don’t ever see Illidan in classic disenchating Gul’dan
