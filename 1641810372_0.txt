[0:54:54] saund: below avarage GDKP's will struggle in ulduar
[0:54:54] prophetzoe22: Group leader just gets all the money? Wtf that’s fucked

[0:55:04] paulieepaull2: Will you hit 42-0 before bedtime?
[0:55:04] Daymercs: nahh
[0:55:05] 0mnibombulator: this is the equivalent of smurfing in bronze elo in league, just play against ur own skill level bruh
[0:55:07] killrog__: and the gold goes to a pot that is split between players in the group
[0:55:10] Daymercs: you can pug
[0:55:10] sinyaii: when you going back to school for that phd @Pikabooirl
[0:55:12] twinbladeuk: or a ert pala Sadge
[0:55:15] Daymercs: and most pugs now do 2 item SR
[0:55:17] ripintides: it is literally so easy to get into a guild raid, my guild literally just did 24man immortal because we didn't have a 25th KEKW
[0:55:18] robbns: gdkp is stupid
[0:55:20] WhoTheHellisMogli: harder to gdkp on retail with xserver
[0:55:21] Sparticle100: lol I mean what's gonna be harder for a new player.  Farm 10k+ gold or join a guild
[0:55:27] AugTV: So you are basically gonna need to be ballin irl to be able to afford the gold to buy items :D
[0:55:29] Drkblur: i dont understand why classic players went back to gdkp?
[0:55:29] rzlaqk: LUL

[0:55:43] moujee01: 25man nax pug ok, pretty sure uldurar will wipe on trash
[0:55:48] killrog__: you can run gdkps and make gold this way for 2 weeks and buy whatever you want

[6:17:18] sakuiin: pika u pushing 10h stream?
[6:17:19] acquitypremier: Meth is right handed version of amphetamine and adderall is the left handed version
[6:17:20] DeanGTV: Oh that was back when it was Tempo Storm! i remember now
[6:17:20] Yorandomexplode: why hunters hitting 40k kill shots

[6:18:11] cybixgoblin: sounds like DMT
[6:18:12] dauxboy99: is he kodak black.. im on adderall
[6:18:13] realatro: yes in doses that are low and not recrational people with adhd can feel as if they got something that makes them feel like they should have ben feeling like this for all along but its often taken by mistake as thee euphoria / but in high doses it makes you scatter brained and changes focus on subjects like mitch
[6:18:16] VitoBambino: ima be honest Pika idk what you were trying bro LMAO
[6:18:17] YahniiTooHotty: its how life should be
[6:18:19] acquitypremier: It is d-amphetamine for meth and L-amphetamine for adderall, they are isomers
[6:18:19] c4s_mangler: How would swords hemo spec do vs melee?
[6:18:25] 0alpha12358: Hunters are not hitting 40k  kill shots
[6:18:26] narcdime101: yeah i gotta take 30-40mg a day lol
[6:18:32] RogueDogg: adder misinfo
[6:18:33] flovin1: it's bad in long term
[6:18:34] YahniiTooHotty: @Pikabooirl you prob took too high of a dose
[6:18:40] Anonomysss: you build up tolerance and then its basically microdosing, so you only get merginal effects
[6:18:41] flovin1: my friends had hard time cuz of that
[6:18:41] StorMskies: if you see shapes when you take adderall. you dont have adhd lmao
[6:18:42] theericberic: @Pikabooirl bruh Im from Europe, it is NOT normal at all to hear of a nation hooked on Adderall
[6:18:49] LfgPlex: i was 60mg for years
[6:19:08] jBeastwood: normalize ADHD.
[6:19:11] Arkelly92: 90 percent of yall dont need that shit consider this
[6:19:12] realatro: acqquilt lmao no, dd-amphetamine is not meth its a compeltely diff drug prescribed just like adderall, adderall is d and l amphetamine salts d-amphetamine is dexedrine, methampetamine is literally a different drug.
[6:19:42] cybixgoblin: @theericberic pharma in the US pushes young Doctor's to prescribe it
[6:19:51] victordm2794: USE RACIAL
[6:20:04] Myltra: suddenly everyone in chat has a medical degree
[6:20:08] victordm2794: USE RACIAL, EATING SP
[6:20:14] cybixgoblin: @theericberic pharma reps become best friends with doctor's, go golfing with them and shit just to push prescrips
[6:20:35] imphamousbro: i left 4 hours ago and you were 5-0.... what kind of progress is this pika
[6:20:36] DeanGTV: @Pikabooirl was that in 2016 with chanimal? the winners was Splyce, Fabs/boetar/swapxy
[6:20:41] Redziee: in the uk where im from you have to go through vigorous tests before potentially given medication, brain scans and everythin @cybixgoblin
[6:20:41] acquitypremier: @realatro was talking about the metabolites in the body
[6:20:45] mexirican81: EZ
[6:20:45] realatro: I see one person giving actual medical terminology, and i'm a physicians assistant yes @Myltra
[6:21:13] mac_driz: @myltra or people just weak I was told I had adhd in school never took adderral grew up to be fine just couldn't focus in school wit bullshit I didn't wanna learn
[6:21:14] orpuc: he defo has it
[6:21:18] dauxboy99: Im on adderall i feel hightech when i piss
[6:21:22] buhbangbruh: Self diagnose Jones
[6:21:23] realatro: @acquitypremier still wrong, meth is still a different drug - it can has it's own d,l isomers as ewll.
[6:21:25] theericberic: @cybixgoblin it's nuts man, that's what it is, and here we have Mitch self diagnosing himself like a Tumblr girl
[6:21:29] kelfeno: all i know is everyone I know who knows this much about meth is addicted to stimulants
[6:21:38] realatro: doesn't convert to d-amphetamine
[6:21:41] mortreedh: that guy say much zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[6:21:50] se0nz: bro what is that hair lmao... gotta fix that @Pikabooirl
[6:21:50] johnytsunami: sounds like an infant
[6:21:54] DeanGTV: @Pikabooirl they played Bm/Enh/Rdruid(HPal)
[6:21:57] TheKevh: TheKevh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[6:21:59] Dhezqt: That step the pet was INSANE
[6:22:04] mlbAct: @kelfeno i know a lot about meth and i’m addicted to downers absolutely hate uppers
[6:22:17] CerealKiller_HS_: Hey @pikabooirl is it true that rogue just becomes better in pve as WOTLK phases come out but shittier in pvp?
[6:22:17] n3oeclipse: pikabooDent check?
[6:22:18] Sardaco: big worth for me
[6:22:27] surfingdog25: its jones
[6:22:28] buhbangbruh: @pikabooirl gotta fix the headphone hair XD
[6:22:30] jBeastwood: I was diagnosed with severe adhd. Mitch for sure has adhd.
[6:22:31] surfingdog25: hes the case
[6:22:43] cybixgoblin: that's not ADHD that's lack of social skills imo
[6:22:43] dauxboy99: he does
[6:22:46] Redziee: mitch does that in calls constantly LUL with xaryu
[6:22:46] hemm__: lol
[6:22:49] ssj2cooler: thats fried
[6:22:49] Anthony925x: OMEGALUL
[6:22:50] braydynn333: wsg brotha bear
[6:22:51] colin_md1: this is a core demographic for that medication that has addictive qualities, so it makes sense there's a lot of buzz about it.
[6:22:56] surfingdog25: Mitch is literally that
[6:23:00] reminiscence16: ooooh wow wow
[6:23:01] jBeastwood: There's different forms of severe adhd
[6:23:02] Wottl: Sounds like that's a convenient excuse to start ignoring people
[6:23:05] reminiscence16: my friend has been like that recently lol
[6:23:05] narcdime101: pretty spot on lol
[6:23:10] reminiscence16: i just assumed he didnt like me LMAO
[6:23:15] doublewhopperwithcheese69: yes he does 1000% hahaha
[6:23:29] mlbAct: you legit described mitch wym he doesn’t do that lol
[6:23:32] theericberic: jokes aside, Mitch prob does not have a severe case of ADHD, but Im wondering about myself, some smaller simptoms fit
[6:23:42] lilbbyoda: That’s def Mitch lmao
[6:23:50] Drkblur: no chat. people with adhd are hard to have a conversation wtih cause they cant even hardly pay attention to what youre saying. mitch is hyper active but he carries conversation well
[6:23:52] iripple: do i really need 16 ads in an hour
[6:23:57] Wottl: the problem with defining adhd like that is it becomes easy to convince yourself you have it, and easy for someone to sell you pharmaceuticals over it
[6:24:11] rothman182: he was on the mage and pika died first KEKW
[6:24:12] jBeastwood: ADHD traits also include trouble keeping up with things, getting really into things then falling off entirely, struggling with planning, and so much more
[6:24:15] braydynn333: braydynn333 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:24:22] CerealKiller_HS_: Hey @pikabooirl is it true as WotLK phases come out, rogue becomes better in pve but worse in pvp?
[6:24:23] mlbAct: “last game” … 40 games later
[6:24:33] synergistx: Dk is balanced Kappa
[6:24:39] theericberic: agreed, you need a proper psychological assessment by a  professional in order to determine if you have ADHD
[6:24:40] teyec_: its insane lmao
[6:24:44] cybixgoblin: ADHD symptoms = challenge of growing up IMO
[6:24:45] surfingdog25: its not very bad long term
[6:24:49] ilovecoodies: how far did you guys get before loss
[6:24:49] mlbAct: @jbeastwood yeah that’s legit me bud idk if i have adhd
[6:24:54] surfingdog25: so bad
[6:24:58] reminiscence16: yep
[6:24:59] nebzy_: No, adderall is insane, being on this stuff long term is really bad for you
[6:25:01] realatro: yeh adhd symptoms are so easy to say "yeah i have  that" the reason is because the symptoms ofr adhd and it's different types are lliterally everything
[6:25:03] VitoBambino: nah bro i just do taxes LMAOOOO
[6:25:05] sakuiin: @Pikabooirl u doing 10h stream?
[6:25:07] acquitypremier: Thats how i feel when spearfishing lol
[6:25:08] hemm__: there is also just ADD the original
[6:25:10] Faithdimmer: Like Wrath arena?
[6:25:13] celipra85: @jBeastwood 1000000% correct, as i live with it. IT seriously sucks sometimes
[6:25:17] buhbangbruh: It’s literally legal speed
[6:25:19] DeanGTV: @Pikabooirl everyone was playing BeastCleave or Demo/Enh at that tourney. BeastCleave came out on top
[6:25:26] Redziee: ur supposed to microdose adhd med
[6:25:31] mlbAct: @realatro yeah i have a lot of the symptoms but i don’t think i have it idk
[6:25:34] wakkolol: that sounds carzy as shit
[6:25:36] chaddarkwizard: adderal to make a sandwich KEKW
[6:25:37] chuckers37: No
[6:25:40] Drkblur: Generally people with adhd just feel normal with it
[6:25:41] whattheh3llbro: isn't is just like speed?
[6:25:42] Wottl: adhd is an incredible excuse to medicate an entire population and induce problems
[6:25:47] chuckers37: I work in family practice and thats not the case
[6:25:53] CerealKiller_HS_: Hey is it true as WotLK phases come out, rogue becomes better in pve but worse in pvp? @pikabooirl
[6:25:55] jBeastwood: Adderall is different when you have adhd compared to not. People w/ ADHD have low dopamine from things, so adderall increases the stimulus to comparable levels to regular people.
[6:25:58] cybixgoblin: yeah they hyperactive part of ADHD just means you're a fucking kid... boys don't wanna sit there in class 8 hours a day, yeah they're gonna seem hyper
