[1:18:13] azgal0r33: it can be for 9.2, the cinematic shows northrend and naxxramas
[1:18:47] rosina_scarlett: ellesmere can beat echo's team

[1:32:00] theszoti: it's been confirmed that he's the last boss of shadowlands
[1:32:21] Exodeo_: I wouldn't mind SL being shortened..I don't like it lol
[1:32:23] theoneeleven: @Towelliee I dont think it will end early, but I think the expansion will move away from shadowlands after 9.1
[1:32:26] satanic_viewer: I have class from now 7am till 6pm, kill me tow
[1:32:26] garkhyt: You 1st hear it here.... Towii called it :D
[1:32:30] Xsilentghost: so in other words 10.0 is gonna be huge like 8 zones 12 dungeons on release /pray

[1:33:02] Exodeo_: What do you think the next expansion will be?
[1:33:04] Gebirges: Blizz normally finishes the story of an expansion with the .2 patch and sets up the next with the .3 patch
[1:33:36] rohdey: i mean, if it's 3 years and content people want to play it'll be no different imo

[1:37:12] Exodeo_: There just seems a massive radio silence on retail atm
[1:37:30] rohdey: could be non discloser stuff
[1:37:39] Kelticlore: I wouldnt be surprised if blizz has back up plans incase something happens during expansion and the .3 patch has to be scrapped to focus on the nextr expansion
[1:37:58] Sephirothxz: @towelliee do you think they alteady gave up on shadowlands or was just their plan to go this slower?
[1:38:19] Exodeo_: I'm using the downtime to gear and learn how to Guardian though, so I don't mind :)
[1:38:23] Yagr6: they are to prideful to give up on shadowlands
[1:38:38] Xsilentghost: So what would be the recovery path if there was no 9.3? Like wouldn't 10.0 have a huge lack on content in they're behind.

[1:39:05] BadXo: BadXo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 78 months! 
[1:39:18] theorodrem5: shadowlands isnt a bad expansion for them to scrub
[1:39:21] Gebirges: and i honestly don't think they drop Shadowlands because it's way too well recieved
[1:39:23] theorodrem5: so much potential
[1:39:27] Xsilentghost: They also had over 25 Job postings for just wow like last 2 weeks
[1:39:44] Gebirges: hell yea
[1:39:44] MundiPlays: @Towelliee what do you think will be the lore theme of 10.0?
[1:39:52] satanic_viewer: I don't like the story
[1:40:10] belfmasterracer: i miss BFA :(
[1:40:10] cruzeal: shadowlands is meh
[1:40:13] piratechris: If you go by subs it's not really well received
[1:40:16] Layercake: They are at least 6 months behind on dev time since SL release, they have 2 choices , remove 1 major patch or delay 10.0. We will see
[1:40:25] Exodeo_: I still think Wod was worse than SL
[1:40:39] theorodrem5: theres just nothing to do now
[1:40:41] eGomatiCs: I miss Legion
[1:40:45] Gebirges: the one thing that makes Shadowlands bad atm is the lack of patch content due to the pandemic shit
[1:40:47] Yagr6: i could care less about the covenants and i would rather have a new talent system/revamp
[1:40:47] Gebirges: imo
[1:40:49] satanic_viewer: i loved wod story, but the game was bad
[1:40:50] theorodrem5: thats all, but leggos and soulbinds i find to be interesting
[1:40:52] PadidinJones: @Towelliee what was the worst expac IYO
[1:41:07] strike879: just wish they would use more of the old zones. the brokers are a perfect ''enemy'' to go to old zones in oribos its already visible they travel to get things so we could go to grizly hills to save furbolgs or something
[1:41:30] Kelticlore: Wasnt MOP the longest expansion

[1:41:51] Gebirges: WoD was the longest LUL
[1:41:52] adoreith: wasn't cata?
[1:42:06] AureliusXV: a lot of bandwagon shit on twitch
[1:42:25] Sephirothxz: We seriously needs some challenge mode sets/weapons in Shadowlands its getting really boring
[1:42:32] Gebirges: 1 year of ICC with a raid no one knows now before Cata
[1:42:57] rosina_scarlett: MoP was 779 days

[1:43:34] NecromedesDK: HFC to Legion was forever ngl
[1:43:56] keenoberry: it reveals one of the flaws of how they've been doing the patches and how theres no content outside the patch's content
[1:43:56] satanic_viewer: mop drought was not unbearable cause of timeless isle pvp and good content overall
[1:44:00] Gebirges: Ruby Sanctum tho
[1:44:11] Layercake: And that was without a pandemic HahaThink

[1:44:55] satanic_viewer: this man knows nuthin'
[1:44:58] PadidinJones: Comon Cletus! You gunna walk over but you gunna limp back
[1:45:19] satanic_viewer: legion invasions was awesome
[1:45:25] Gebirges: Legion Pre-Patch Leveling lmao
[1:45:27] rosina_scarlett: i want another legion pre patch leveling imo
[1:45:29] Kelticlore: Legion prepatch is super great for LVLing
[1:45:30] Gebirges: so fast
[1:45:30] heydoublea: i loved legion
[1:45:33] Jay_rb: Everyone was farming rares on the Timeless isle for content KEKW
[1:45:34] Exodeo_: I still use those invasions to lvl lol
[1:45:42] theoneeleven: Need another preleveling event
[1:45:44] satanic_viewer: i remember seeing crossroads full of people
[1:45:44] XarkoLP: i missed the Pre-Patch-Leveling FeelsBadMan
[1:45:48] Demkie: Is there a way we get some release dates this tuesday during the Q&A ?
[1:46:10] Gebirges: are Legion invasions still worth for leveling? oO
[1:46:20] Kelticlore: I use WOD for LVLing
[1:46:32] TweakT: August release TBC :D
[1:46:39] fat_european0: @Towelliee Do you think we will have the next xpac announced in 6-7 months when Blizzcon was supposed to happen? LUL
[1:46:42] Cartharon: do you think we will get prepatch date this week?
[1:46:52] Yagr6: wasnt there a rumor that the dragon isles is gonna be a future expansion
[1:47:06] satanic_viewer: i believe on tow, he's usually on point
[1:47:09] shmurcules: Why you say “technically” they can’t say anything about 9.1 before tbc
[1:47:14] XarkoLP: imagen TBC and 9.1 will release on the same date KEKW
[1:47:32] 123Sepi123: are they keeping us waiting so long for new content in order to get a massive sub drop, so it will increase like crazy again when new content launches. Thus unlocking new millions in bonues to the CEO?
[1:47:36] luckfore: man the wow community is hungry for some new content ^^
[1:47:41] Xsilentghost: Do you think SOD will have anduin/garrosh mythic only phase
[1:48:18] Chhakss: @towelliee do you think they will continue making till wotlk or tbc might be the last?
[1:48:20] Sephinated: !room
[1:48:20] Moobot: @Sephinated Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[1:48:22] Antdavs24: May 18th for pre patch of BC release? Because if that’s release shouldn’t we get pre patch this week then lol
[1:48:25] GTmask: towTinfoil
[1:48:26] Gebirges: The best thing Blizz could do for m+ next to the rating system is make keys either completely random OR give us the choice of dungeon for set key
[1:48:50] Antdavs24: Quarterly earnings 1000% matter lol
[1:48:58] luckfore: 6month sub with mount 100% when 8.1 launches
[1:49:11] Gebirges: WoW on Switch Pog
[1:49:27] LazyDynamics: so TBC release in 2nd quarter?
[1:49:54] xaezoria: which mount is this?
[1:49:58] Layercake: They are 100% banking on TBC saving the year ...and maybe they are right
[1:50:22] Antdavs24: Got it @towelliee thanks man! Misheard
[1:51:02] alejandrogonor: Do you play classic?
[1:51:22] fat_european0: Do you think they'll change the new xpac every 2 years cycle? It feels like they need more than 2 years of dev time for xpacs tbh.
[1:51:25] Gebirges: 9.1 in late May and TBC in August
[1:51:48] xaezoria: which mount are you farming?
[1:51:48] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[1:52:13] Gebirges: NEVER Kappa
[1:52:25] Tyrolore: Oondasta @xaezoria_r
[1:52:33] fat_european0: we've only seen 2 bosses
[1:52:41] PadidinJones: I mean at least it stopped crashing!
[1:53:02] Thdlock: they typically do like 4
[1:53:06] Thdlock: but 2nd week was planned to be only 2
[1:53:10] Reign_69: 9.1 possibly late June early/mid July

[1:55:53] Zlick: I cant wait for items to be Mawforged for +10 ilvls in Shadowlands KEKW
[1:55:58] Thdlock: im almost done when thats over i will be sad i need grind
[1:56:03] Thdlock: give it to me give grind
[1:56:15] siphira_: Portals KEKW
[1:56:20] 123Sepi123: have you done CE this tier?
[1:56:34] SirGoldenPants: You probably get asked questions along the lines of this quite a bit. Do you think wow will ever be fixed or slowly die over time
[1:56:53] neverbornlucky: shadow and bones  is good  if you like fantasy
[1:56:55] Gebirges: If Mawforged armor would give bonus armor, i'm fine with it when they bring back Glad Stance for Warrior
[1:56:58] preheats_lawyer: Man teleport for +20s seems kinda weird. I was expecting a mount for that or something. Maybe all +25s will be a mount? But I think only 100 ppl would get that monkaW
[1:57:14] Gebirges: +15 is Mount
[1:57:18] Gebirges: +20 is Teleport
[1:57:19] Nuhaso: Nuhaso subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:57:23] neverbornlucky: netflix
[1:57:25] ChidaRL: i just got the mirrors completed on my paladin but the chests just keeps giving me the Dagger transmog
[1:57:29] Funderik: what do you rate mortal kombat? i gave it a 9/10, some throwbacks, comedy at times, action, just overall a good nostalgia trip
[1:57:33] preheats_lawyer: @Gebirges I was thinking a glad equivalent mount
[1:57:41] 123Sepi123: wow will have a long life, alot of players are not even interested in trying other games, they have way too much time invested in wow to just give it up
[1:57:48] Gebirges: In MoP and WoD Silver rewarded the mount and Gold gave the Teleports
[1:58:00] preheats_lawyer: so?
[1:58:01] Gebirges: and transmog
[1:58:12] BarthelemeusNL: and did you get a paragon on your monk?
[1:58:23] viRo_369: should be +15 tele // +20 mount
[1:58:28] alejandrogonor: towWar
[1:58:36] preheats_lawyer: Do you think we'll get the new xpac announced this year?
[1:58:40] ShafinTwo: @preheats_lawyer  nice name lmao
[1:58:46] fat_european0: with avoidance PogChamp
[1:58:47] Gebirges: a permanent teleport is just too good tho
[1:59:07] heydoublea: can prot pallys do mythic castle?
[1:59:10] preheats_lawyer: @demoholic123 :D
[1:59:12] heydoublea: or would it be too hard
[1:59:17] neverbornlucky: two year  old  nephew to smart for own good. figured out how to unlock the door  with  a quarter
[1:59:25] Exodeo_: How is the renovating going btw?
[1:59:27] ChidaRL: i have gotten the ring a few times on the vault and i kept choosing something else
[1:59:35] Thdlock: avoidance is a secret op stat sometimes like i remember argus mythic our tanks wearing lower ilvl for 20% avoidance because the only dmg was his scythe and that was reduced by avoidance same with epxlosions
[1:59:37] dazz911: is there a realese date for TBC classic ??
[1:59:38] fat_european0: I was eligible to trade away the first sire ring I looted which sucked FeelsBadMan

[2:12:54] XarkoLP: Legion felt a bit to fast for me with all the patches
[2:12:58] carpentz0r: I’m just trying to get Max ilvl before new patch
[2:13:11] Thoreya: They shud get rid of soul ash

[2:13:41] ChidaRL: i am saving my stygia for the mounts in 9.1
[2:13:42] bengu_bengu_: they should stop creating systems every expansion and then create new systems to fix the old system. They need to FOCUS on CONTENT
[2:13:43] GonoFPS: yeah Im time gated for my 235 lego, my warlock is full 226 with a 190 lego lol
[2:13:45] fat_european0: I just want to play my damn class without feeling gimped. As a mage I want NF for Fire, Venthyr for Frost and Kyrian for Arcane...
[2:13:46] pooranoia: pooranoia: words mean nothing im singing to don KING
[2:13:47] Xsilentghost: But why, why is it like that
[2:13:55] Gore90: Yeah they are just screwing themselves. Hopefully one day they will make another good expansion
[2:14:02] luckfore: legion had a new update every 77 days, it was so good
[2:14:06] Funderik: if we want to be real, it won't be till past 10.0 we will get "normal" patch lengths. there will be a delay when they get back in office too because it will take time to setup and get used to it. :/
[2:14:08] piratechris: I don't think you can solely blame working from home for the current situation with retail. There is more too it in my opinion.
[2:14:12] JLmorten: They know we are going to bee here for a loong time and have time to do this slow.
[2:14:15] noway137: @Towelliee covid im guessing?
[2:14:15] dsj0: Besides covid but do you think could be the reason for the delay. Internal directional conflict?
[2:14:17] XarkoLP: but if they let catch up to fast, u would unsub earlier Kappa

[2:15:52] noway137: renown catch up isnt there? @Towelliee
[2:15:55] adoreith: I know they say that we have the whole expansion to get anima for all the mount etc but you can bet that they will add more and more cosmetics for anima, which in the end is just stupid to collect
[2:15:56] neverbornlucky: i spent  all my anime on armor upgrade for warrior
[2:15:58] fat_european0: Accountwide ve'nari didn't change much tbh. You still need to do the same stuff taht gives you rep for stygia
[2:15:59] Zoidbergxxx: Yea now we can upgrade gear to 197ilvl poggers
[2:16:02] Thdlock: the thing is I dont really trust them after the scam they did in the beta with conduit energy
[2:16:03] Funderik: there's always the option of not doing the anima stuff, since it's cosmetic and bonus content. maybe it's me
[2:16:03] Gebirges: i did farm every day now to go from level 2 on everything to level 3 portals in 7 days
[2:16:04] Antdavs24: The anima grind is actually a joke, Idk who they assumed would want it in its current state

[2:17:11] adoreith: honestly like when they nerfed his health a few weeks ago on HC, it made the fight even harder haha
[2:17:11] Thdlock: what they could do is make it so that he auto phases at 35% instead of 40% or timer
[2:17:23] Funderik: sire was tuned good i think
[2:17:36] ChidaRL: i was doing sire earlier, and we were wiping because people didnt stop dps on phase 1
[2:17:46] Omajjin: towUnforch towUnforch
[2:18:14] Tofter: wowprog doesn't count asian servers
[2:18:17] othraerir: 1851 9/10
[2:18:19] kronnnotv: whats that chestpiece called on your orc ?
[2:18:19] Daikanatv: 898 according to wowheads tracker
[2:18:24] Exodeo_: My guild is working on Council atm <.<
[2:18:24] GonoFPS: 836
[2:18:40] Exodeo_: Also, I love the tmog on Doomer
[2:19:02] drunch85: 1017?
[2:19:05] AsapXO: 1853-1836
[2:19:12] GonoFPS: 1017
[2:19:14] almighty_h0lm: The chestpiece is Rampaging Giant's Chestplate @TheKronnoLad
[2:19:32] kronnnotv: @almighty_h0lm thanks :D
[2:19:50] preheats_lawyer: Honestly, it's kinda crazy to think that we were supposed to have next xpac announced in 6 months this year and we're still 2-3 months away from 9.1
[2:20:35] Jakeminater: Hammers up!
[2:20:36] fat_european0: I agree. They should make the game more fun
[2:20:36] Moobot: TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch! || Towel will be switching to Belf Pally on prepatch || No TBC Launch date or prepatch date yet.
[2:20:39] chukudu: we got Daisy, Daisy is love Daisy is life
[2:20:40] othraerir: depends how badly they want people to keep playing i guess
[2:20:42] idenkaz_: maybe give casuals a reason to play so the game doesnt fell dead
[2:20:57] lanara233: Blizzard haven't even acknowledged that there's a delay to 9.1
[2:21:14] Xsilentghost: if everything was normal when would of 9.1 originally released?
[2:21:19] Funderik: @preheats_lawyer we won't get 10.0 info this year, no way.
[2:21:37] preheats_lawyer: @RS_Iron_Jay not release, but announcement of the xpac. We were supposed to get it if there weren't any delays
[2:21:42] idenkaz_: its almost like mythic + and mythic raider won the fight over WoW. so  they have the game for themselves. The ksm shit still makes me angry af.
[2:22:11] Funderik: @preheats_lawyer "supposed to" you mean expecting :P
[2:22:11] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:22:12] pkLeech: are there even any predictions/infos on 10.0/next xp?
[2:22:24] idenkaz_: sry im a bit mad of what is happening in wow atm
[2:22:30] Mozzi_IRL: its a MF to try and get an alt geared
[2:22:48] preheats_lawyer: @RS_Iron_Jay I mean that's the cycle they've been doing since forever.
[2:23:07] ChidaRL: i have 2 high geared characters, and all others are like 200-207
[2:23:07] fat_european0: @Towelliee Nah mains are fucked as well tbh. The game is sooo offspec unfriendly...
[2:23:11] rhaw78: I have such bad gas.. my wife is gonna hate me
[2:23:16] Zlick: Just farm Valor and upgrade ur alts.. Oh wait, Valor cap KEKW KEKW
[2:23:17] lucaniusTV: Do we know when tbc comes out has blizzard said anything
[2:23:20] Gebirges: DansGame
[2:23:44] Funderik: @preheats_lawyer there's notihng saying it won't or will happen, 9.1 will be out before blizzcon and we'll get 9.1.5/9.2 info aswell.
[2:23:45] TechnicolourTV: 11k rn I think
[2:23:48] MleveK: its account though
[2:23:51] Gebirges: season max is 9.5k
[2:23:52] almighty_h0lm: valor cap is 9500 right now
[2:23:56] Zlick: You cant upgrade a single 2h from 184 to 220 KEKW
[2:24:05] TechnicolourTV: err, yeah 9.5k
[2:24:07] chrispape: KSM gated to use valor sucks ass
[2:24:09] torridcheese3: I'm stuck between getting to 60 and raiding in classic before TBC and gearing a new alt before 9.1. Both feel like forever.
[2:24:12] preheats_lawyer: @RS_Iron_Jay I mean yeah. But it's extremely unlikely. It puts into perspective how far behind Blizz is :/
[2:24:17] almighty_h0lm: but upgrading solid gear pieces (2h weapon for example) is expensive
[2:24:23] GonoFPS: what suck is the soft gates to upgrade your gear, I get it for early on but at this point in the game people log in do 1 raid 1 key log off
[2:24:36] satanic_viewer: what's your vaping setup?
[2:24:53] GonoFPS: so for people who get back online it's either you buy or buy it
[2:24:59] rhaw78: @GonoFPS that's what I did in BFA, lol
[2:25:18] rhaw78: that one raid and M+ part
[2:25:29] Funderik: @preheats_lawyer yeah everyone knows they are behind, but can't blame them, i bet they would all love to be back in the office with each other working like normal. it's effected 1000s of games.
[2:25:37] dsj0: Will raider io and the ingame rating system be the same or separate?
[2:25:48] BulldozerBear: How is that any different than raider.io?
[2:26:01] preheats_lawyer: @RS_Iron_Jay Oh yeah, i'm not blaming them for it. I just thought it was kinda mind blowing tbh
[2:26:01] jasperboy: @dsj0 separate things afaik
[2:26:01] idenkaz_: yeah bu weekly 15 is no casual content whatsoever why dont they get that
[2:26:10] dsj0: Thanks
[2:26:30] dsj0: Well, then I have a feeling people will just ignore ingame system and stick with raider.
[2:26:38] Blistz1: Are blizzard back in the offices now?
[2:26:44] Zlick: While you wait, bring new character to Oondasta :D
[2:26:44] fat_european0: over 1k I think
[2:26:45] Thoreya: theyre splitting tyrannical and fortfied. thats huge lol
[2:26:47] MleveK: 1K
[2:26:47] rohdey: 1k and up
[2:26:49] woody879: lol 400
[2:26:49] Thoreya: ppl gonna be pissed
[2:26:52] woody879: i wish
[2:26:56] rohdey: 1h is 400
[2:27:00] Cerbrus0: Spaming M+ in this xpac just sucks, doing anything above 15 don't reward you on anything, you just do it for raider.io, the fact that you only get 210 ilvl for a 15 is ridiculous @Towelliee
[2:27:10] Funderik: @preheats_lawyer yeah it really sucks, really sucks, a break is nice and healthy tho. they just need to keep staying open about it and letting people know.
[2:27:37] Blistz1: wait
[2:27:40] flebbooo: that sucks FeelsBadMan
[2:27:45] Blistz1: are they at home or at the office?
[2:27:49] Thoreya: they need new fucking ideas
[2:27:53] Thoreya: and split away from classic stuff
[2:27:59] fat_european0: Just repeat Legion idk why it's so difficult FeelsBadMan
[2:28:27] Thoreya: @fat_european0 bc they scrapped WoD after a year

[2:28:29] soth_klf: revert gcd changes all i want
[2:28:35] Gebirges: look them adding Master Loot back LUL
[2:28:37] adoreith: look how long we waited for a pvp vendor lol
[2:28:41] Cerbrus0: Spaming M+ in this xpac just sucks, doing anything above 15 don't reward you on anything, you just do it for raider.io, the fact that you only get 210 ilvl for a 15 is ridiculous @Towelliee
[2:28:50] dreamjag: the loot caused 2 guilds i was in to die
[2:28:51] fat_european0: @Thoreya Yeah, but they have the foundation with legion. Just copy paste most of it. It shouldn't need as much dev time.
[2:28:59] Xsilentghost: Do you think Ion is a big problem or its just other stuff
[2:29:00] Kelticlore: sets should be a higher iLVL
[2:29:08] Mozzi_IRL: I never it seen it becoming that difficult.
[2:29:13] BadXo: They tried to bring SL close to classic (loot and grind) - and nobody wanted that
[2:29:22] kalmenus1: So you’re saying they are using the craps table to make decisions LUL hope it lands on red
[2:29:24] Thoreya: i think half of the wow team wants one thing. the other half the wow team wants something else
[2:29:28] Thoreya: which is a big problem
[2:29:32] Artivicii: sup sup
[2:29:34] Thdlock: ye i mean not sure why they thought classic stuff was good to replicate its 2 different games
[2:29:36] Contendedlemon: and blizzard being blizzard will stick to their guns and not change a thing and not listen to the community till its last minute (9.3) but it will be too late
[2:29:39] idenkaz_: Twitch

[2:29:51] Thoreya: BFA was a loot pinata and people complained i specifically remember that
[2:29:59] MetalManGG: I just want to find a guild to do a couple of m+ before the new raid comes out. I haven't raided since Uldir and that makes me sad
[2:30:00] piratechris: The loot cause me and all my friends to unsub... we will probably re-sub for TBC but yeah that's were it's at
[2:30:05] Blistz1: Lol remember john hight video where he was high af
[2:30:13] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: the most agregious part was that PVP gave insane targeted loot while pve gave you nothing
[2:30:20] adoreith: probably the release of classic in general influenced everything
[2:30:21] Secondbreakfasttt: with all respect but fckhm
[2:30:27] Thoreya: Ion gets pressed more than John. when John is higher than him LUL LUL towGift
[2:30:30] Thoreya: poor Ion
[2:30:43] idenkaz_: let loot be loot, yeah right buddy KEKW
[2:30:47] BadXo: The personal loot system is also not a good design
[2:30:47] PoppaShot: @Towelliee nothing was better than getting that mega titanforged arcano crystal from the world boss in legion KEKW
[2:30:48] Blistz1: i wish blizard were more commucative like riot games
[2:30:56] 2naDlisch: All those brit youtubers pined for "loot that matters"
[2:30:57] Gebirges: make Loot great again
[2:31:00] Thoreya: not for nothing tho when Ion say that all twitch chat got hyped
[2:31:00] othraerir: it's not like you needed loot to kill vanilla bosses
[2:31:01] pkLeech: @Blistz1 good one LUL
[2:31:01] Thoreya: so idk
[2:31:01] byrdeen45: they need to bring back tokens
[2:31:02] Kromede: you no take candle IonJam
[2:31:08] Samaellus: @Towelliee  There is not og wow team anymore
[2:31:11] Thdlock: IonJam conduit energy
[2:31:17] Mozzi_IRL: I truely hoped the Vault would be better than what it was
[2:31:21] michaisn: They should make it that loot from endgame content is usable until the end of the expansion, thats a good thing from classic

[2:31:33] rhaw78: D3's new season has been nice. Good break from WoW
[2:31:33] preheats_lawyer: Spend weeks getting 2.1k rating to clear a raid with barely any loot and any gear you get you have to trade away. FeelsGoodMan
[2:31:34] GonoFPS: my experience turned out so shitty lmao
[2:31:36] allinex_wow: I cant wait for a new MMO to come out. currently just doing 1x m14 key a week to collect the weekly chest
[2:31:46] flebbooo: truue, i admit i thought less loot was a good idea but in practice it felt awful
[2:31:53] BadXo: "Let loot be loot" is fine, but let people TRADE loot and don't starve and gate everyone so badly
[2:31:55] dsj0: im one of those. I actually thought it would be more rewarding with less loot. But oboy did I change my mind
[2:32:02] pipboy733: after a mount or something?
[2:32:07] Djfarmville: Remember when kungen had a breakdown about how little loot he got shadowlands LUL
[2:32:08] bengu_bengu_: bring back titanforging :)
[2:32:17] Thoreya: they need let retail be retail. let it be its own thing, and let classic be classic. itll allow retail more freedom to do whatevertf they want
[2:32:17] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[2:33:02] brilargaming: When are they building the new cabinet? I`m stoked to see it done
[2:33:05] allinex_wow: Why dont they just get some top players on 1 desk and let them figure it out - easy for them
[2:33:05] Thoreya: titanforging may seem like a controversial topic
[2:33:09] JeemTeam: ya if they would regulate it
[2:33:13] spankymcpie: it made me wanna run mythic+ dungeons more
[2:33:20] Funderik: we are getting maw touched armour, maybe that's your new tf/wf/corruption gear :P
[2:33:26] Gebirges: Ion is that kind of person that can't accept defeat or someone being right over him @Towelliee
[2:33:40] preheats_lawyer: I guess wow will be good again when we get Legion Classic FeelsBadMan
[2:33:43] othraerir: OMG don't talk sense ;)
[2:33:47] Thoreya: how much u wanna bet its John height thats making all these bad decisions and not Ion LUL
[2:33:58] MetalManGG: it was like that in MoP wasn't it?
[2:33:59] Mozzi_IRL: That sounds like a good idea
[2:34:12] flebbooo: i watched one of your Legion reviews from back in the day and u mentioned the exact same thing at the time Clap
[2:34:16] fat_european0: @MetalManGG yeh it could thunderforge or warforge 5 ilvls higher
[2:34:25] Funderik: that sounds good now, however half a patch in people would hate it. let's be honest
[2:34:29] MetalManGG: yeah, thunder/warforged was really good
[2:34:35] luckfore: so why dont they listen?
[2:34:39] idenkaz_: was a soul crushing stream bro.
[2:34:51] Jermo11: i miss legion FeelsBadMan
[2:34:55] Thoreya: bc a lot of people dont like titanforging?
[2:34:55] dreamjag: yeh great system i miss the forging and bonus rolls made it fun which is why you should play games in first place
[2:34:57] Xsilentghost: what is your biggest hope for tomorrow preach interview

[3:23:49] Sollice: Thor Ragnarok was amazing
[3:23:49] noway137: dr strange is great origin
[3:23:50] odysseus1: we don't talk about Norton's Hulk though
[3:23:51] FresheFefe: dr. strange
[3:23:57] idenkaz_: Ragnarok was trash
[3:23:57] SpratsTV: guardians of the galaxy is my favorite
[3:24:02] industry_: Hey @towelliee are you playing Returnal later?
[3:24:04] 2naDlisch: Captain America could have been longer, and still be great
[3:24:12] Ribbwich: @Towelliee do you watch Hulk lol
[3:24:17] I_DoctorSatan_I: End Game is probally the best MCU movie out there, beating the originals tbh
[3:24:24] Darthyrevan: @Sollice it is... yeah just didnt like how they cheesed it compared to the other 2, prefered the more serious thor
[3:24:26] ShadoodHD: captain marvel... meh
[3:24:40] Wh1rly: what did you play in classic wo?
[3:24:43] Ribbwich: Any of them lol
[3:24:45] Sollice: @Darthyrevan Well then I guess you wont be watching Love and Thunder :P lol
[3:24:48] xaezoria: whos your favorite hulk?
[3:24:50] ArcaneSyntax: yeppppppp thats why i play one too.
[3:24:50] Ribbwich: in your MCU rewatch
[3:24:52] 91Niki: Cap winter soldier is my fav mcu movie
[3:25:08] jerexify: Ragnarok was trash? WHAT? That movie was fantastic.
[3:25:19] Ribbwich: whats wrong with Captain Marvel now?
[3:25:33] ElPolloBatman: the first cap movie was rather bad. i didn't like that they sugarcoated world war 2 for some international audience and were afraid of showing swastikas, because whoever might get butthurt by that. doctor strange was also not that good, they need to amp it up by a lot for doc strange 2
[3:25:33] Darthyrevan: >_>
[3:25:38] 91Niki: If you say Ragnarok is trash you literally have ZERO taste
[3:25:38] industry_: Awesome I can't wait to see you play it
[3:25:38] Mostdangspy: Def the best Thor movie
[3:25:41] 0rvis: Hell yeah it was amazing Pog
[3:25:43] Sollice: @Darthyrevan Darth...How old are you if you don't mind me asking.
[3:25:45] alundrius: ragnarok was amazing
[3:25:51] Bullviine: it was ok, Hulk was terrabad in it thouhg
[3:25:52] raldrik: towUnforch
[3:25:54] Seerated: Yea, that was a good one, Hela so damn hot
[3:26:00] Darthyrevan: @Sollice  np and im 28
[3:26:00] Wh1rly: what game?
[3:26:01] 91Niki: Taika Waititi is a fucking god amongst directors
[3:26:25] Ribbwich: Taika Waititi is gonna help save star wars
[3:26:28] I_DoctorSatan_I: Well, Age of Ultron set the pace for Tony since his vision when all of the Avengers died trying to beat Thanos when Capt America said "You were supposed to save us....". That dialog is the MOST important dialog in the MCU. This is why Tony died because he knew he HAD to, not because he wanted to.
[3:26:31] Rayvon_Lunatic: returnal reminds me of metroid
[3:26:33] YardRage: I thought Ragnarok was good, particularly leading to up the really really dark avengers movie
[3:26:34] noway137: idk if this is an uunpopullar opinion but i really didnt like black panther...
[3:26:36] Sollice: Ahh ok. Your old enough then. Ragnarok sang to my 80s kid heart. If you were super young it may not vibe with you. But you are old enough to get it
[3:26:56] ElPolloBatman: there are people who dislike gotg and ragnarok because they're moving away form the comics by a lot and basically james gunn and taika waititi movies. a big issue with gotg is that drax is an entirely different and extremely dumb character compared to his comic version
[3:27:12] idenkaz_: he looked badass but thats it
[3:27:19] ArcaneSyntax: im excited for Sam Raimi's Doctor Strange.
[3:27:23] Ribbwich: bruh i completely forgot Ultron. Constantly in Wandavision I was like "have I even SEEN Age of Ultron...?"
[3:27:33] Anyerfillag: @ElPolloBatman if Marvel/Disney didn't like what they were doing those movies would be changed ASAP
[3:27:42] ElPolloBatman: apparently age of ultron had a 3-5h cut once whedon was finished
[3:27:44] noway137: allso quicksilver PepeHands
[3:27:46] Alexakosgg: clicker
[3:27:46] 91Niki: @Sollice Taika Waititi is gonna direct Love and Thunder as well. It's gonna be amazing HYPERS
[3:27:48] YardRage: James Spader's voice was awesome for Ultron.. that's about it ha
[3:27:52] alundrius: would have loved to see ultron get 2 movies, james spader was soo godd
[3:28:15] dv_domino: @YardRage agreed
[3:28:20] Darthyrevan: Yeah just personal opinion really, i understand everyone has their own favourites / dislikes. The director did well on mandalorian just hope he does well with star wars
[3:28:24] alundrius: blacklist
[3:28:24] drunken_panda86: watch it
[3:28:26] ElPolloBatman: one does not simply go full retard and release a snyder cut
[3:28:28] drunken_panda86: it's awesome :)
[3:28:30] alundrius: its goooood
[3:28:32] xaezoria: blacklist is amazing
[3:28:32] R2RHIN0: Black list is a great show
[3:28:33] Mostdangspy: They are still making more Blacklikst. It is amazing
[3:28:38] Ribbwich: I mean, Age of Ultron made over a billion dollars.
[3:28:40] drunken_panda86: and his character is the most intriguing one :)
[3:28:41] Ribbwich: So.
[3:28:43] ShadoodHD: you need to watch it man, it's good
[3:28:47] JMoney_1331: Stargate was gold
[3:28:49] I_DoctorSatan_I: I cant wait for Guaridans of the Galaxy 3 though...we get to see Adam Warlock
[3:28:55] Takobaited: !room
[3:28:55] Moobot: @Takobaited Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:28:56] Keldirrin: Yeah, Blacklist. He pretty much has his Ultron voice on the entire time. Its fun imagining that he is Ultron in a human skin.
[3:28:58] idenkaz_: i was so bored i watched the mentalist. its now one of my fav shows ever KEKW
[3:29:05] ElPolloBatman: i'm more interested in the future. will feige even bother to try and form a second avengers team?

[3:29:30] Ispintowin: I watched Mortal Kombat on Friday and it was really good @towelliee
[3:29:31] ElPolloBatman: the top two are avatar and endgame
[3:29:32] Sollice: @91Niki Everything he touches is gold. I am so looking towards it
[3:29:36] dv_domino: tony stark funneled money to inflate the numbers for age of ultron
[3:29:37] Takobaited: they re-released avatar again
[3:29:39] idenkaz_: at some point they did
[3:29:40] noway137: avatar was rereleased in china @Towelliee
[3:29:42] 91Niki: It did, and then Avatar re released, and beat them again LUL
[3:29:45] ElPolloBatman: both movies went for two move screenings
[3:29:49] Sollice: End Game beat Avatar, but this year they RE RELEASED Avatar to get more money
[3:29:49] idenkaz_: yes
[3:29:58] Sollice: Which I think is complete shit
[3:30:01] Ribbwich: Avatar sucks monkey balls
[3:30:02] itakkii: !room
[3:30:02] Moobot: @itakkii Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:30:07] ShadoodHD: omfg re released? KEKW
[3:30:10] 91Niki: @Sollice Literally. He's AMAZING
[3:30:11] 2naDlisch: It did beat avatar, then disney put avatar back in the theatre in china
[3:30:13] Ondikus_maximus: They re-released Avatar in China like 2 months ago so it would get #1 again, lol
[3:30:15] YardRage: Frozen 2 Jebaited

[3:30:24] idenkaz_: KEKW TFA
[3:30:26] Ribbwich: @Towelliee it was the first star war in a whille
[3:30:34] pyrocannibal00: new star wars = trash
[3:30:39] Sollice: They should re-release Black Panther...That's probably an easy 200 million more
[3:30:46] noway137: han is coming back for F9 Pog
[3:30:46] nonstopdisco: thanks for streaming in the mornings, towelliee.. i love these convos.. so chill and relaxing
[3:30:49] jiffynuts: And who wins? Disney. All that Disney money
[3:30:52] Ribbwich: @pyrocannibal00 you shut your mouth about Mandalorian.
[3:30:52] PadidinJones: As a family @Towelliee
[3:30:57] I_DoctorSatan_I: that's pretty shady, End Game beat Avatar, but then they flipped the script and took #1 spot again. LUL
[3:30:58] 91Niki: @Sollice Yep. Chadwick is gonna carry that <3
[3:31:17] Sollice: I hear he didn't win the Oscar last night...People aren't happy
[3:31:20] 91Niki: LUL agree Towelliee

[3:32:01] Takobaited: people didn't realize how coool Chris Evans was until after his first movie
[3:32:05] Ribbwich: @Towelliee wow it only made 370m
[3:32:18] Ondikus_maximus: It was at the beginning where this whole superhero era was just gaining traction, so it kinda makes sense.
[3:32:27] 91Niki: @Sollice People are more unhappy that he didn't get more appreciation time. Most people aren't unhappy that he didn't win. They are just unhappy the academy haven't recognized him more for his work.
[3:32:29] sh1asurprise: Yeah people still had Fantasic Four PTSD when First Avenger came out
[3:32:30] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Takobaited He had a good role in the movie "Push"
[3:32:30] Ribbwich: wooooooooooooooow
[3:32:38] Sollice: I am a Marvel fan boy but I enjoy some of the DCEU movies. I am still amazed though that DCEU can't get a Kevin Feige type of person to think of the long game and guide DCEU to success. What a shit show that company is
[3:32:45] pyrocannibal00: lmao
[3:32:46] LawnSpeaker: warcraft movie was good though
[3:32:56] ArcaneSyntax: captain america also cost way less than the warcraft movie
[3:32:58] TODDMANFLEX: warcraft was amazingly bad lol
[3:33:05] Takobaited: @I_DoctorSatan_I absolutely, agreed, MCU just made him super popular
[3:33:07] Ribbwich: Warcraft is better with the deleted scenes
[3:33:14] Ribbwich: where someone says long eared fuck

[4:00:03] Nico_vdM: Jaina has a LOT of explaining to do
[4:00:12] casualfury: activision exist because of the dreadlords
[4:00:16] mmrghost7: pandas are dreadlords booom
[4:00:17] Holybytheway: I wanna know why demon hunters cant "detect" the dreadlords in the Venthyr Covenant Sanctum

[4:00:29] Apokolipz: illidan  exists because of the dreadlords   but he saw the truth
[4:00:33] Contendedlemon: dw we'll kill the jailer in one LFR que Kappa
[4:00:35] mattmasters96: story good yes, the game itself isnt that great
[4:00:39] Sollice: Jailer SHOULD NOT DIE this expansion. He should actually win and next expansion should be a huge galactic war and jailer has become so powerful the other realms have to join forces to kill him
[4:00:40] Blah206: Preach <3
[4:00:41] Funderik: from before wow, since warcraft.
[4:00:46] ShadoodHD: i can't wait to drag that "Light" dreadlord and kick his ass to tell us everything
[4:00:46] Artivicii: im diggin the lore rn, might have more potential than Legion
[4:00:47] flebbooo: 100%
[4:00:58] evillocks: the void and old gods wont let the jailer take over
[4:01:05] Ribbwich: How would the Jailer even "die"?
[4:01:12] FistoTheFistybot: Sylvanas kills the jailer KAppa
[4:01:13] ShadoodHD: Lorthraxion: Champion. welcome back! Wait why do you have that bludgeon?
[4:01:14] Nico_vdM: Is the Dreadlord world destroyed?
[4:01:15] hostile2715: so, who's gonna get the "ENOUGH!" moment in 9.1?
[4:01:16] FistoTheFistybot: Kappa *
[4:01:19] Nico_vdM: Nathreza?
[4:01:20] idenkaz_: Nzoth will come in clutch so save our ass. mark my words.
[4:01:25] ghostofnappa_doom: nzoth our true leader and his return to save us
[4:01:25] Wcvechten: We'd probably be stuck in the middle
[4:01:26] Artivicii: group up with nzoth KEKW
[4:01:29] Apokolipz: the jailer uses the sword into azeroth
[4:01:37] BarthelemeusNL: give me my twilight def back and i team up whit him as a tank XD
[4:01:40] ShadoodHD: BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD, wait wrong Old God
[4:01:51] raldrik: Yes lets do that group with old gods. TD without corruption limits
[4:01:53] LoremasterMarthan: Give me a Halo 3 "work with the flood" moment with Nzoth and we just drop the Jailer's ass
[4:01:54] alundrius: world war warcraft
[4:01:58] casualfury: poor jailer
[4:02:01] Sollice: @Towelliee Thats how it should be. This should be the time where Blizzard just goes fucking ape shit
[4:02:02] Spaede: The Dread lord doing dreadful things ** Pikachu face**
[4:02:05] pyrocannibal00: i can finally be a murloc
[4:02:06] Blah206: Jailer sounding a lot like myself
[4:02:07] Funderik: i hope for once we don't win and they do some crazy shit. we a due a loss
[4:02:09] Holybytheway: Whats gonna be the name of the next Xpac? Jail ? Pog
[4:02:09] Lycis: But they were all betrayed o.o
[4:02:11] Nasilvera: Azeroth Endgame
[4:02:16] idenkaz_: Nah bro Nev´ari is still there.
[4:02:17] Sollice: And make it the biggest expansion ever. WoW needs them to do this
[4:02:17] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee And Illidan gets to kill him at the end LOL
[4:02:20] I_DoctorSatan_I: Just know, Queen Azshara is a "visionary" that can see things to come. Why do you think N'zoth kept her alive....
[4:02:22] PhillyDilly18: Are we only destined to fight the cosmos going forward in WoW? Not complaining, just wondering.
[4:02:26] PadidinJones: Could it very well be possible that we might lose this expac? @Towelliee
[4:02:36] Artivicii: milhouse manastorm will probably be on the jailors side
[4:02:46] ShadoodHD: then we transition to Starcraft MMO 4Head
[4:02:55] idenkaz_: this will not happen any time soon bro
[4:02:57] idenkaz_: sorry
[4:02:59] flebbooo: that would be amazing Kreygasm
[4:03:05] stefan4dawn: @shadoodhd  true
[4:03:08] Nico_vdM: I still want my void vs light expansion
[4:03:10] soth_klf: Protoss class OMG
[4:03:11] Silvergorillia: When does tbc drop?
[4:03:24] PadidinJones: That might not be too bad if they make Starcraft MMO like SWTOR
[4:03:26] capnkalland: which he'll get
[4:03:30] idenkaz_: waking up azeroth? this is the biggest event in wow, no way they do this
[4:03:32] evillocks: what if the Jailer releases all death onto azeroth
[4:03:32] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:03:34] Dyriks: yes and another excuse to have Magni yell at us to collect Azerite Kappa
[4:03:36] BarthelemeusNL: no he still needs the sigil from the arbiter
[4:03:40] spekktrum19: If they jailer invades Azeroth, I could see the Titans coming back
[4:03:40] Artivicii: @Nico_vdM yesss give us a paladin/priest/warlock expansion plsss
[4:03:45] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:03:47] Sollice: @Nico_vdM I don't know that we will get that. The light can be pretty terrible also. Blizzard normally does a good vs evil thing
[4:03:49] Funderik: 9.3 will be the setup to go back to azeroth, 9.2 jailer will be free and causing problems.
[4:04:02] soth_klf: 9.4 we kill the jailer and be the jailer
[4:04:03] Rudric_Ice: what if Jailer is the good guy and we just don't know it yet ?
[4:04:12] Nico_vdM: Well I didnt say that either void or light was good
[4:04:20] savioccs: what song is this? is this from diablo? sounds like it
[4:04:24] Nico_vdM: Just the two entities going against each other
[4:04:26] Sollice: It's diablo yes
[4:04:30] mrsig27: mrsig27 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[4:04:36] idenkaz_: i cant see that. waking the world soul up, finally seeing her as a "titan" would make the story ready for its conclusion
[4:04:38] capnkalland: What's going to happen with aduin
[4:04:52] Sollice: If we are lucky? He dies and we never hear from him again lol
[4:05:09] Nico_vdM: He is probably making babies with Sylvanas
[4:05:13] Nico_vdM: or practicing
[4:05:23] ShadoodHD: my prediction will come true.. eventually towTinfoil
[4:05:25] casualfury: true
[4:05:28] Masqerader: Wrathion will show up and be like "i have this cloak"
[4:05:30] Funderik: yeah i think 9.2 the jailer will be free and all the shit will kick off
[4:05:30] Dyriks: "The jailer has hurt azeroth! Champion! I can smell Azerite nearby! Lets go collect it!" Kappa
[4:05:33] BarthelemeusNL: you forgot one thing the arbitor still has a sigil to so you needs to attack oribosd too
[4:05:34] I_DoctorSatan_I: Jaina said it herself in the beginning area of Najatar: "Azshara, the most powerful sorceress the world has ever known.". I think Azshara will make a appearance sometime in this expansion.
[4:05:38] casualfury: LUL
[4:05:41] Artivicii: best case scenario? he rerolls into a paladin and becomes half as badass as his father @capnkalland
[4:05:43] YardRage: Jailer tired of not being able to use his mount Kappa
[4:05:44] nielefs: they stop at 9.2 i think
[4:05:46] Apokolipz: hehe
[4:05:56] Unlivedsam: Unlivedsam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[4:05:58] Sollice: At this point, I would be ok with 9.2 ending if they need the time to turn around and make 10.0 the most insane xpac we can get
[4:06:02] pyrocannibal00: uh oh, coffee is workin
[4:06:03] DecayedmiNt: Jailer just wants to kill everything
[4:06:03] Ambersulfr: If it takes them this long to put out 9.x updates they might as well go to 10 relatively quickly.
[4:06:09] Masqerader: there is no Thanos bs
[4:06:11] Masqerader: with jailor
[4:06:16] ShadoodHD: good intention by killing millions of innocent people?....
[4:06:17] mattmasters96: I still think Nzoth still killed all of us and we got sent to the shadowlands :)
[4:06:29] hostile2715: What's Lothraxion's deal?
[4:06:36] Masqerader: if he kills the arbiter it all ends
[4:06:39] Sollice: He probably doesn't. I think Jailer and Arbiter are two halves of one being
[4:06:48] Funderik: he attacks the arbiter in the raid, they added in a new area with 9.1 data mining
[4:07:00] Nico_vdM: unforch
[4:07:02] idenkaz_: it was Ve´nari all along Kappa playe Agatha theme
[4:07:10] Artivicii: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[4:07:12] Dimitrios90: LUL
[4:07:18] I_DoctorSatan_I: my question is, what's supposed to go into the Jailers chest. It's just a empty hole in his chest.
[4:07:21] Aravarth: are the spoilers over yet
[4:07:24] priestoverdrive: how did jailer manage to create an army if he was banished and stuff..?
[4:07:31] Novirtue_: Would be the biggest twist ever, when you defeat the jailer you wake up in azeroth realizing that shadowlands was a complete corruption dream of Nzoth and the world is fully corrupted so it's Cataclysm 2.0 LUL
[4:07:34] idenkaz_: I sitll believe bro
[4:07:37] acklesdh: monkaW
[4:07:38] drunch85: Towelliee is a dreadlord Kappa
[4:07:39] idenkaz_: just saying
[4:07:40] mattmasters96: Jania is a dreadlord
[4:07:40] kimmo_gaming: BOOM
[4:07:42] ShadoodHD: towTinfoil
[4:07:42] acklesdh: monkaS
[4:07:48] Rudric_Ice: you gonna play resident evil 8 when it comes out ?
[4:07:49] Sollice: towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil towTinfoil
[4:07:50] Ambersulfr: @Aravarth mostly, just speculation now.
[4:07:53] Xsilentghost: whoever did the voice acting for venari is great
[4:07:54] Nico_vdM: Ven'ari is Illidan or Magni KEKW
[4:07:59] PvtHudson093: Everyone is a Dreadlord
[4:08:12] captain_steve_rogers: My question now is, Towelliee are you a Dreadlord, because it seems like everyone is now
[4:08:13] mmrghost7: jaina is the dreadlord
[4:08:14] Masqerader: 7th
[4:08:18] BarthelemeusNL: did you finish falcon and the winter soldier?
[4:08:31] ShadoodHD: joining the twilight hammer aint so bad now....
[4:08:33] Sollice: @PvtHudson093 That may actually be a plot point. We finally find out dreadlords have infiltrated everyone and now we are all suspicious of everyone
[4:08:53] Artivicii: play VR horror game pls tow
[4:08:56] unreformed_xd: where did u get ur weapon from
[4:08:59] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee do we still think july timeframe for the patch?
[4:09:02] capnkalland: Does that mean you have your Vegas trip planned yet?
[4:09:11] Sollice: Oh god
[4:09:14] Sollice: SHIT WIZARD
[4:09:16] Artivicii: khadgar KEKW
[4:09:22] Ambersulfr: Maybe we rescued dreadlords from Torghast and not our friends :o
[4:09:23] itrollulel: hey bud, were you actually getting push notifications from immortal? just curious
[4:09:29] MleveK: @Towelliee TBC vs 9.1 which would you play if they came out at the same time.
[4:09:30] Wcvechten: I mean, isn't medivh also still kinda chilling in space or something
[4:09:34] mmrghost7: khadgar is having party
[4:09:34] PadidinJones: Dadghar coming to save our asses
[4:09:36] Sollice: Here comes Khadgar coming back to be everyones hero
[4:09:36] ShadoodHD: wait... then medivh could be one ScaredyCat
[4:09:40] Yurian33: so Khadgar has Cerebro
[4:09:41] Artivicii: wouldnt illidan technically be able to detect them
[4:09:41] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee No no no, if Khadgar returns that means Magni returns LOL
[4:09:44] Squirrel_nutty: khadgar is a shit wizard
[4:09:46] twistedstick1: Jailer will disappear for one x-pac then it's on.
[4:09:47] ShadoodHD: and magni
[4:09:50] Wedgeh: So WoW turns into the biggest game of among us, trying to weed out the impostors?
[4:10:00] itrollulel: not sure how i feel about that
[4:10:02] DunzoCD: When does Illidan come back with Sargaras in tow?
[4:10:12] Sollice: @Wedgeh Good point lol
[4:10:12] PadidinJones: Dadgar comes back but anduin stick him with Kingsmourne!
[4:10:13] itrollulel: i mean yeah i get it, but from diablo... eeeek
[4:10:13] ShadoodHD: AND ILLIDAN TOO NotLikeThis
[4:10:19] MrGattz: you can turn off notifications you know...
[4:10:21] Holysal: you can turn it off
[4:10:24] I_DoctorSatan_I: TBC = old recycled content. 9.1 = new content. geee, which would i play if they both came out...hmmm, hard choice!!!!! Kappa
[4:10:29] MrGattz: fucking crazy ik
[4:10:31] Masqerader: wait
[4:10:32] capnkalland: mind blown
[4:10:42] Nico_vdM: Champion, several azerite woooons lay exposed nearby
[4:10:44] Sollice: I can't wait for Immortal to come out. I will be purchasing a new toilet seat to accompany it's launch
[4:11:04] AMDFusion: !room
[4:11:04] Moobot: @AMDFusion Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™

[4:11:09] Masqerader: u mean I have the power to turn off notifications on my phone? the innovation these days :P
[4:11:13] Holybytheway: even then you got MTX look at blizz tbh
[4:11:24] Ambersulfr: If thrall was replaced, that explains his strange-ass weapon choice in the Maw opening. towTinfoil
[4:11:26] Holybytheway: DIablo immortal fiasco
[4:11:31] I_DoctorSatan_I: mobile gaming is extremely popular in China though, that's why most companies shill out mobile games.
[4:11:33] Sollice: One of those nice pleather deals. And I will not be able to piss standing up at that toilet as to not dribble on the seat
[4:11:37] twistedstick1: Toilet seat in the shape of a phone?
[4:12:01] MrGattz: people are just dilutional
[4:12:04] ShadoodHD: nothing is free
[4:12:04] Aravarth: Nevermind that, it's a basic tenet of business. The business needs to make money.
[4:12:16] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: people are lucky you dont have to pay for it and have micro transactions
[4:12:17] Riggoz1: Battle pass + cosmetics I assume
[4:12:19] MleveK: as long as MTX are cosmetics
[4:12:30] I_DoctorSatan_I: the air i breathe is free 4Head
[4:12:38] Layercake: No Mtx LUL ...COD mobile made 10 billion in 2020
[4:12:43] traunch: gross
[4:12:57] Sollice: Please make a future battlefieldf
[4:13:03] Barralgul: i'd spend hundred of euros for a wow gatcha
[4:13:14] klindatu: Maybe a RAID: Shadowlegends but with Warcraft characters in high res?
[4:13:15] Ambersulfr: I don't know how I feel about WoW Mobile. I like the complexity of it on PC
[4:13:18] Sollice: No previous or current war Battlefields. Go back to the future and give us something interesting
[4:13:21] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: if they make wow for mobile it would be cool to see wow for console
[4:13:48] Rudric_Ice: EZ
[4:13:48] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:13:49] Masqerader: @Sollice it will mostly be modern again
[4:13:52] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Sollice that was a failed Battlefield though. BATTLEFIELD (is the next title name), will be modern.
[4:13:56] Holysal: most of the world dont mind p2w games. US is the country that doesnt like it
[4:13:56] aikopooh: big numbers=$$$
[4:13:58] Riggoz1: how much is that a month lol jeez
[4:14:02] Dyriks: I've been waiting for Immortal for a long time. I can't wait to play it <3
[4:14:06] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: only 10 years? I think it would take blizz longer than that
[4:14:08] Layercake: And during a pandemic btw LUL
[4:14:16] Sollice: 2142 was a head of its time though. A future Battlefield now would make more sense
[4:14:25] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: holy shit wow
[4:14:32] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: I didn't expect that

[4:14:45] Artivicii: blizzard gear store is pretty pumpin too
[4:14:52] misternil1214: when is wow mobile coming out??
[4:14:53] Sollice: Good old Scourge McKotick getting ready for his money vault pool
[4:14:54] unreformed_xd: where did u get ur weapon from?
[4:14:55] Holybytheway: 25€ for an automated process YEP Realm Transfer
[4:15:01] MrGattz: its not like anyone is forcing you to play them
[4:15:06] pulses_music: are they gonna launch the Burning Crusade on official servers?
[4:15:06] Rudric_Ice: i wanna play diablo immortals ngl
[4:15:09] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Sollice no it wouldnt. The mass majority of the BF community wanted a "modern" BF. The community is also tired of "future" and "past war" titles.
[4:15:22] Broomba: @towelliee that baby orc will be best seller and make millions
[4:15:22] unreformed_xd: oooohh okay ty
[4:15:23] Artivicii: artifact wep

[4:15:30] Holybytheway: PvP legion aritfact app i think
[4:15:43] Aravarth: @Towelliee Honestly, MTX is basic psychology. Someone is willing to pay 9 diamonds or whatever to skip an hour to reset their timer on their match-3 mobile game because of the endorphin hit.
[4:15:51] Griffo525: Griffo525 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[4:15:51] mattmasters96: you think they are gonna make anything past Wrath Classic? I dont think so personally
[4:15:59] Nico_vdM: @Towelliee there is a Blizzard news post where they state that there will be optional purchases for Diablo Immortal
[4:16:01] Aravarth: They wouldn't pay $0.25 though because that's "real money", so they set up in-game currencies that they have to buy.
[4:16:02] Rudric_Ice: it is already
[4:16:10] Mecabeast: morning hope we're keeping the towunforch to a min
[4:16:10] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: some phones now days have ports to plug in a tv and controller
[4:16:14] Broomba: @mattmasters22 it will stop at wraith classic
[4:16:25] Aravarth: I guarantee Blizzard's mobile games will have some in-game currency.
[4:16:31] AlexSinclair: @Towelliee  do you think blizz will do anything about dead realms. Im currently on a server that is connected to 6 others but most of the time there is less than 50 people online.
[4:16:36] Artivicii: pc dead race
[4:16:49] Sollice: @I_DoctorSatan_I I agree it shouldn't go back to old wars that is done. But it's not like BF hasn't had its fair share of modern setting titles.
[4:16:53] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: I bought my ez gf a razer phone and it was like a medium strength pc literally had like 16gb of ram
[4:16:57] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: ex*
[4:16:58] 24sevn: activision didn't make cod mobile :)
[4:17:14] Rudric_Ice: WoW on console lets go Kappa
[4:17:31] corncob78: if you think about it. comparably. very few people have xbox ps5 PC... everyone has a phone
[4:17:38] Ambersulfr: As much as I hate to admit it, I spend more time on mobile because I can't be in front of my PC and take care of the kids.
[4:17:38] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[4:17:47] Ambersulfr: So I personally put more time and money into mobile.
[4:18:04] Mecabeast: mobile games are just worse console games
[4:18:05] Masqerader: sell the kids on ebay, problem solved
[4:18:06] OceanManCarter: Blizz better not announce those mobile games at Blizzcon if they want things to go smoothly hahaha

[4:18:17] Ambersulfr: I'll do like 15 minutes here, 15 minutes there, and it really adds up.
[4:18:33] Rudric_Ice: i mostly play mobile games when im in the bathroom or about to sleep
[4:18:36] onyx_pupper: pllus most mobile games have a huge pay to win system that is a cash cow with low rates
[4:18:38] Aravarth: Seated on the toilet for an hour -- bad for you. Seated at the PC for 8 hours straight -- no big deal. Kappa
[4:18:38] raldrik: you know when your feet fall asleep on the toilet that its a good mobile game
[4:18:42] Sollice: @chbrown299 They can announce mobile games, but it can't be their lead title for a franchise.
[4:18:48] Layercake: It's miracle that we still get great single player games without MTX, i can't imagine the struggle that some devs have with all the pressure from all the suits
[4:18:50] Artivicii: @raldrik KEKW
[4:19:10] misternil1214: wow mobile would be dope
[4:19:11] Kravel: raid shadowlegends is sh!t
[4:19:21] Mecabeast: clash of clans was like log in upgrade at someone come back in an hour
[4:19:40] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Sollice And EA/DICE learned from past/current data which BF titles are still getting play time. It's BF4, BF1 and BFV. But it's been back to back "past war" titles. where as its been 8 years since a modern BF came out. That's why. 8 yrs is a LONG time for a much needed "modern" BF titles.
[4:20:23] ZakuzaGB: i prefer the old style world war battlefields
[4:20:42] remixonfire91: no more ww2 bfs pls
[4:20:42] Moobot: TBC is around the corner! If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde!

[4:21:11] Sollice: We have like 4 MP WW2 games coming out this year so yeah a modern BF game is needed for sure
[4:21:13] Mecabeast: low key I have a feeling dimmortal will be really freaking good
[4:21:31] Aravarth: I mean, I really liked Day of Defeat 3.1 back in the early 200s
[4:21:33] Aravarth: *20000s
[4:21:38] Aravarth: ffs 2000s
[4:21:43] jamarky23: Sorry to say but the gunplay is absolute dogshit in that game
[4:21:54] Nico_vdM: What class are you playing?
[4:21:55] Sollice: @Aravarth Living in the future
[4:21:56] jamarky23: looks good tho
[4:22:06] Ambersulfr: The desert thing is the devs of diablo memeing us at this point.
[4:22:06] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Aravarth yea DoD was extremely popular back in the day. Such a good game for that time.
[4:22:21] TSquadSully: TSquadSully subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[4:22:48] SonofHorus82: @I_DoctorSatan_I BF Hardline was the best BF in the last 10 years so hard agree on that point.
[4:22:57] Masqerader: the only errors i saw in Enlisted was pilot error by a streamer Towellikazie @Towelliee
[4:23:07] Sollice: Ehhhhh I dont think many people would agree with you @SonofHorus82
[4:23:18] ZakuzaGB: it kind of makes you feel like a winner no matter what because you get so many Bot kills
[4:23:23] SonofHorus82: @Sollice those people can eat it.
[4:23:27] Sollice: lol
[4:23:34] Aravarth: @I_DoctorSatan_I Almost married a girl I met playing DOD. Had a really, *really* big community I played with, and man a lot of neckbeards were upset I hooked up with this one girl in it.
[4:23:43] Sollice: I actually forget Hardline was a BF title. No joke
[4:23:44] PhoenixAuTv: Hardline ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[4:23:45] remixonfire91: BF3 was the goat
[4:23:46] MrGattz: payday 2 is better.
[4:23:46] SonofHorus82: Fucking LOVED Hardline. Fight me.
[4:23:47] I_DoctorSatan_I: @SonofHorus82 huh? BFH flopped within the BF community in less than a year... LUL BF4 was king over BFH
[4:23:53] Masqerader: Battlefield 3
[4:23:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:23:58] jamarky23: BF1 1000%
[4:24:07] Aravarth: BF1942 Kappa
[4:24:10] idenkaz_: bf3 was something special man
[4:24:10] S1appadabass: Battlefield 2142 is the real goat
[4:24:12] Masqerader: Battlefield 2 in 2005 will always be my favorite
[4:24:18] 91Niki: Hardline was fun. You could rekt up kills so easy in that game. But it's far from the best bf game
[4:24:34] remixonfire91: BF1 was so much fun , i hope the new bf brings the engine to a modern combat scenario
[4:24:44] Mecabeast: wasn't 3 the one where people memed jumping out of planes and sniping someone out of a helicopter while falling
[4:24:45] I_DoctorSatan_I: becasue BFV is shit and BF4 has way too many cheaters.
[4:24:49] Zolshy89: good, they changed the colors
[4:24:54] Rudric_Ice: its the same map just rehashed
[4:24:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: i havent played BFV since January LUL LUL
[4:25:16] Zolshy89: of map and made it so there is more cover so you dont get caught out behind big areas with no cover
[4:25:27] Sollice: Neir:Automana 2.332147812647521498932856278553675189725637192

[4:25:55] Mecabeast: I picked up outriders last week after watching you and sloot play
[4:26:11] Secondbreakfasttt: it's like Korthia recoloered with 2 zones lmao
[4:26:19] Masqerader: I shouid get back into battlefield
[4:26:22] Sollice: Ehhh Outriders still have so many crashes
[4:26:27] Nico_vdM: For some reason Nier gameplay is currently tied to your fps.  Since he has it at 144hz the gameplay is very fast
[4:26:42] Aravarth: I imagine Outriders will go the way of Sea of Thieves really quickly... a big initial push, but then ppl get tired and move on
[4:26:46] onyx_pupper: im hyped for mass effect remake
[4:26:50] ZakuzaGB: i never ended up getting it for that reason didnt want to buy it during the hype
[4:26:58] Masqerader: imagine quitting one game because tired of 15s to do another game that u do 15s lol
[4:26:59] ZakuzaGB: looked like a blast though
[4:27:04] ShadoodHD: when it's something like that i don't want to play the game at all :

[4:31:01] Mecabeast: 35 weeks and no mount yikes
[4:31:11] magemaster225: how many players do you think are staying lcassic only

[4:31:18] dels78: the real question is, why?
[4:31:27] StrengthCoachJoe: @Towelliee have you gotten into sports cards at all? Just opened some new boxes and got a Rod. Blankenship! #KickersMatter
[4:31:45] tigzie: remember when classic came out, and you had people actually forming a line for kills on quest mobs in elwynn
[4:31:58] dels78: gotcha, makes sense for resets
[4:32:06] Aravarth: What class are you planning on playing in TBCC?
[4:32:22] shimwood: @tigzie What's Elwynn? SMOrc
[4:32:28] BarthelemeusNL: but do you have all the drop rate mounts in shadowlands?
[4:32:32] Aravarth: Kappa
[4:32:35] satanic_viewer: @7r4v3L The probability of not receiving galleon mount at 4678 tries is literally 0,03%. How unlucky can you be
[4:32:36] dracullatv: Nothing to do? You can farm Torghast for fun LUL

[4:33:16] 7r4v3L: @satanic_viewer pretty unlucky it seems, 28 chars, everyweek, all with bonus rolls :(
[4:33:22] deygust: pretty sure they said dranei and be are starting at 40
[4:33:29] Rosstt: Do you think shadowlands will get scrapped kind of like WOD was with how long it’s taking to put content out?
[4:33:36] satanic_viewer: @7r4v3L it must be close, or less you're just too unlucky
[4:33:40] Broomba: @deygust who said that?
[4:33:46] tigzie: the day of TBC release, im going to make a big pot of spaghetti that will last me a few days...mmm yummy cant wait

[4:39:46] Aravarth: Surgery? oof
[4:39:50] nocontextlive: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[4:39:50] Carahail: its to early to think nice things like that,need more coffee first
[4:40:02] satanic_viewer: I have huolon, it's super easy
[4:40:08] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Hammer of unforch your face Kappa
[4:40:14] Masqerader: i have hulon/sha
[4:40:16] maccaruso: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[4:40:16] jerexify: @Towelliee If you don't already have the white tricerotops mount from the bones, you should have enough on a character by the time this is over to get it... lol Silver lining?
[4:40:21] ZakuzaGB: huolon is such a nice mount i wanted it for ages was so happy when i did
[4:40:33] jerexify: Or is it the raptor that comes from the bones?
[4:40:47] Mecabeast: thoughts on if they get maguire and Garfield in the next spiderman?
[4:40:53] Nico_vdM: Luckily I got Huolon on the first day
[4:40:59] Masqerader: @Towelliee best way to do it is probably on peta
[4:41:03] satanic_viewer: i got it alone, when I was farming the emperor shaohao rep
[4:41:03] Squirrel_nutty: hammer of unfortunate face?
[4:41:15] Sollice: @Mecabeast I think its kind of confirmed at this point with them getting Alfred Molina as Doc Oct
[4:41:23] Masqerader: I did it on fox
[4:41:26] Broomba: @squirrel_nutty someone is new here
[4:41:35] satanic_viewer: everytime i go to dalaran i feel so nolstagic I want to cry
[4:41:37] Sollice: So there is definitly some cross universe Spiderman craziness going on
[4:41:38] Masqerader: i set my camp to isle and just teleported to the spawn
[4:41:41] Masqerader: think 45
[4:41:52] Squirrel_nutty: Broomba hahahah your cute, no i just miss heard
[4:41:54] Nico_vdM: There is a medallion that ports you there
[4:42:06] Miguel85NYC: Anything new with Swtor?
[4:42:08] Shellstars: Im after Horridan is it normal or heroic? pls
[4:42:14] Nico_vdM: No the isle
[4:42:15] stallowned: they made the drop rate higher for huolon?
[4:42:16] Masqerader: no
[4:42:39] thiccsushi: swtor has great stories but after doing that feels like a skeleton
[4:42:47] Aravarth: Played SWTOR for about a year when it first came out, completed the initial storyline, then after that was like "Meh, back to WoW"
[4:43:14] Miguel85NYC: true
[4:43:22] Sollice: is Patch Power like Brain Power?
[4:43:23] BarthelemeusNL: wow not XD
[4:43:25] Masqerader: @Towelliee use the vulpera racial and just set camp to his spawn with Peta and move the rest over and grp farm
[4:43:30] JayNyte: GW2 has an expansion coming out sometime soon
[4:43:32] ZakuzaGB: you need something to look forward to in mmos
[4:43:34] JayNyte: Cantha
[4:43:36] Aravarth: new content
[4:43:38] Aravarth: yup
[4:43:42] Blah206: big true
[4:43:57] Venasmat: I do :)
[4:43:59] JayNyte: cold. lmao
[4:43:59] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:43:59] Porkbutt1984: seqKEK
[4:44:06] Masqerader: I played GW2 for 2 weeks and that was it
[4:44:09] kronnnotv: thats eso
[4:44:10] remixonfire91: its the last gw2 expansion too
[4:44:11] kronnnotv: xD
[4:44:11] thiccsushi: GW2 is barely above maintence mode with the shit they get
[4:44:13] Balkidar: Its not a bad timeline. The pre-patch will lead people into the TBC launch. Once the content is dried up, 9.1. gg
[4:44:14] MrKhanes: Thats ESO
[4:44:19] stratiss: thats eso lmao
[4:44:19] Aravarth: When you think about it, releasing Classic was the most brilliant subscription retention plan Blizzard could have released. When Classic dropped, retail was in a *massive* content mid-patch drought.
[4:44:20] ZakuzaGB: its really annoying because GW2 was so good bacn in 2012 when it came out
[4:44:20] Putcride: @Towelliee what about rift its been five years since they released a xpack
[4:44:33] remixonfire91: yeap its ending the lore

[4:44:47] ZakuzaGB: GW3 actually has raids
[4:44:51] ZakuzaGB: at the begining
[4:45:03] Sollice: Wasn't it lazypeon who just did a video about Rift. He said he saw NO ONE playing
[4:45:04] Putcride: I believe you
[4:45:10] Miguel85NYC: thats sad
[4:45:18] brain_wash: Rift was dead from the get go imo, toons with giant anime tiddies for waifu weirdos
[4:45:19] Dimitrios90: LUL
[4:45:21] aikopooh: thats suppa sad
[4:45:24] LegoCoin: wow 1 guy LUL
[4:45:25] pahotam: what the addon he uses that tells you where to get everything
[4:45:28] belfastcl: there are more people working in ultima online, which I think are 3
[4:45:29] Dixietwist: lol
[4:45:36] stratiss: He also didn't get out of the starter zone
[4:45:36] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:45:39] Sollice: @pahotam All The Things?
[4:45:41] remixonfire91: i wouldnt be suprised if they were working on gw3 already , they cut out a lot of huge changes specially about wvw in gw2 and since its the last gw2 expansion everything can happen
[4:45:43] Ezmaraldaa: It was a great game when it came out
[4:45:45] SonofHorus82: @pahotam All the things.
[4:45:46] Masqerader: I remember my friend quit WOW for rift in when cata came out, 10 days later, "hi guys, got a raid spot"

[4:45:50] BarthelemeusNL: that is where a snare was hit when he mentioned lazy peon
[4:46:07] belaham: @towelliee  any new information come out about new world?
[4:46:20] capnkalland: I played rift when it first came out for a few months, then got bored of it real quick
[4:46:28] ezxistence: Survival mmos are good, toxic pvp, but fun
[4:46:38] MrKhanes: @belaham Yeah they had some new info on friday i think it was. Check there twitter
[4:46:46] ZakuzaGB: i think he said he was gunna keep doing them but said he was branching out
[4:46:51] Sollice: Listen... I dont watch the fucker. Asmon was watching it while i turned in for 5 minutes lol
[4:46:52] PokerFaceMoose: its called content lol
[4:46:53] remixonfire91: at this poin t he just does it for money
[4:46:55] king_julian_96: How is the game still going if it only has 1 dev I couldn’t imagine a game having 1 dev and still being alive
[4:47:00] MrGattz: sound strategy
[4:47:02] thiccsushi: I mean thats the job he made for himself and built an audeince around
[4:47:14] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: who are we talking about? I missed the start of this convo
[4:47:19] ManChamp: he probably actually hates them but hes still addicted to them Sadge
[4:47:19] Miguel85NYC: all i want is an Official Pokemon MMO
[4:47:20] Sollice: LazyPeon
[4:47:21] thekingkronick: yeah i think he said he didnt have enough to keep his channel completely mmo focused but i dont remember him "shitting" on mmo's i musta watched a diff video
[4:47:30] Artivicii: TF
[4:47:34] MrGattz: did you expect him to be able to figure that out?
[4:47:43] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: oh ok ty
[4:47:48] Rastailian: the aptly named lazypeon
[4:47:49] BarthelemeusNL: so in wow terms he didnt even get too elwyn forest
[4:47:54] stratiss: he plays to level 10 in every mmo and says they are dog shit i dont get it
[4:48:01] Masqerader: Lazy Peon sounds like the nickname of a Urophiliac
[4:48:09] Warcried: Pretty much everything sucks, if you look
[4:48:16] ZakuzaGB: he basically thinks theres no future for mmos anymore based on the games hes played in the last 2-3 years
[4:48:16] codedizle: yet he actively plays ESO LUL
[4:48:21] Sollice: Ehhh I think people going to be disappointed by AoC
[4:48:25] Warcried: Cross your eyes and enjoy something
[4:48:25] belfastcl: i liked his stuff until the ashes of creation vid, that looked fishy
[4:48:37] thiccsushi: eso is kinda fun to play on the side for all the zone stories
[4:48:43] thekingkronick: i dont wanna sound like im arguing for an argument but im genuinely intrigued as to your opinion, do you not think mmos are in a bad state?
[4:49:00] SonofHorus82: I dont know about that. Did you see Madseaon's TBC boost video. Holy shit dude cry more.
[4:49:01] stratiss: All we can do is hope AoC is good
[4:49:11] AureliusXV: it wont
[4:49:19] AureliusXV: lmao
[4:49:26] ZakuzaGB: honestly im not even slightly excited for AoC
[4:49:28] Quillix84: There are a ton of MMOs but that doesnt m ean that its good
[4:49:33] kilroy_xiv: he's still way more positive than HvBabyface... who has descended into madness  LOL
[4:49:35] maccaruso: AoC?  No politics in channel please
[4:49:37] TheRiwen: FF14 is the best
[4:49:59] siiqo_: ashes of Creation, not politics
[4:50:00] thiccsushi: @SonofHorus82 thats classic andys for you they cry about everything and are mostly toxic PokGengar
[4:50:05] Sollice: With all of the ideas behind AoC, is it going to be too hardcore for the average person to want to play it
[4:50:07] Miguel85NYC: What ever happened to EverQuest Next? That game looked amazing
[4:50:07] ZakuzaGB: i feel like AoC would have done better coming out no where rather than being hyped up like crazy
[4:50:15] Bledstepelin: BDO is a lifelong glacier slow commitment, WoW is a casino, and the rest are just sub par
[4:50:15] Bullviine: agree @ZakuzaGB
[4:50:18] Miguel85NYC: did they cancel Everquest next?
[4:50:26] Sollice: Yes
[4:50:31] Miguel85NYC: really??
[4:50:35] Aaradin: Thats been dead for a while unfortunately
[4:50:36] king_julian_96: towelliee how far do you think classic will go will we get a legion classic or will it end at wrath
[4:50:49] Sollice: SOE was doomed the moment it was purchased by Daybreak. That is an S tier shit company.
[4:50:54] Bullviine: Aoc = WAR 2
[4:51:12] stratiss: New World seems to making a lot of good moves recently
[4:51:18] thiccsushi: I think ashes is going to be like no mans sky with the huge hype train crashing when reality sinks in with all the promises
[4:51:27] SonofHorus82: @thiccsushi my real issue is that I'm one of those Candys and when they say that dumb shit it makes all of us look like lunatics. Worst part is when they say "No one" or " We all." Like... m'fer dont lump me in with your insanity.
[4:51:28] Sollice: Why release a game when you can continue to making millions developing a game
[4:51:32] thekingkronick: my personal experience of world of warcraft is i picked it up for the first time like 3 months ago and loved the game loved the dungeons. i pushed to m+10 myself and then decided i wanted people to play with and enjoy/learn the end tier content with. and thats where sadly i put the game down after being unable to find any form of socialism within the game. this is just my experience as a new player but i find it sad, idk if im just in the minority of what people want from an mmorpg anymore
[4:51:35] verentnarv: AoC will have a problem similar to no man sky, people are hyping the game too much and when the game comes, they'll get mad because of their own expectations getting out of hand
[4:52:03] satanic_viewer: i don't like mmo's i like wow, i think a lot of people are like me
[4:52:05] Aravarth: @thekingkronick I think you mean "socialising", not "socialism".
[4:52:12] Wildside1177: @thekingkronick LOL socialism in the game.
[4:52:14] codedizle: @thiccsushi true but nms is really good now LUL
[4:52:35] thekingkronick: i meant socialism mate
[4:52:40] verentnarv: LUL
[4:52:42] Orbion666: Can’t wait for D4
[4:52:43] sharpps: AoC kinda hyped their own game up too much
[4:52:48] Sollice: The last video I saw about AoC with that raiding the castle kind of looked like shit
[4:52:57] LegoCoin: yup
[4:52:58] CloudPants8081: forsenE  still no mount
[4:52:59] thiccsushi: @codedizle Yeah thats the course I see it taking shit in the beginning because of tons of promises that cant be filled on launch then a year or so later they start phasing some of the stuff in
[4:53:01] Artivicii: KEKW true
[4:53:02] stallowned: true
[4:53:15] Aravarth: lol so you're upset there's no seizing the means of production in WoW? lolololol
[4:53:17] LegoCoin: There can be only 1 MMO LUL
[4:53:19] xauron42: Thats a toxic mindset
[4:53:22] MrKhanes: Im really looking forward to New World, i had so much fun playing in it last year. Its not going to be the next big thing in mmorpg genre, but its going to be fun to play regardless.
[4:53:24] BubbaChubbs420: we're spoiled
[4:53:26] Blah206: roflgatorS
[4:53:28] siiqo_: lol
[4:53:35] Kittastrophe: didn't swtor launch fall into that issue
[4:53:38] S1appadabass: not wow, straight to jail
[4:53:43] Mecabeast: that's why e3 always looks so pretty
[4:53:44] ShadoodHD: *grabs popcorn*
[4:53:49] Kittastrophe: and total biscuit trashing the game before release
[4:53:53] Masqerader: people will always find something to bitch about
[4:53:56] remixonfire91: the thing is aoc is making a lot of things for hardcore players thats why i dont see the game surviving
[4:53:59] belfastcl: only ff and eso managed to turn that around, after some investment...
[4:54:00] Balkidar: First impressions have and will always be a real thing
[4:54:00] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:54:01] thiccsushi: The problem with AOC is the huge promises they keep making over and over then showcasing barely anything and adding in cash shop stuff LUL
[4:54:09] Jm3llow: No LFG? LeTs aLL pLaY cLaSsiC and TBC!
[4:54:11] remixonfire91: they dont make things for the casual player
[4:54:11] jbeastb: @Towelliee Imagine if our expectations for a MMO on release existed when WOW launched originally
[4:54:13] sinlesssinner: we aint spoiled get with the times :)
[4:54:15] codedizle: I like WoW for collecting, I like eso for it's progression the CP system is cool, story, zone design and housing
[4:54:16] Aidler: asmon will try to protect AoC. he likes it. it covers many things he wants. lol
[4:54:17] belaham: so you are saying the MMORPG community is the original cancel culture LUL @towelliee
[4:54:27] Bullviine: I think the stuff that thye have showed of AoC they are drinking their own Koolaid, as honestly it looks so bad, its closer to EQ2 then being better than WOW
[4:54:33] JOYhossain202: @Towelliee what do u think of new patch 9.1?
[4:54:38] ZakuzaGB: yeah let the devs do their thing ffs
[4:54:41] Blah206: ^^
[4:54:43] Artivicii: KEKW
[4:54:49] Orbion666: ALTF4 ftw LUL
[4:54:56] Aravarth: I think what it is, is that MMO people just want to complain lol
[4:54:58] king_julian_96: Even wow expansions are veiwed harshly in alpha if it sucks
[4:54:59] thiccsushi: @Aidler On paper with all the things they say will be there it sounds like it will be the best mmo but can they deliver on that probably not
[4:54:59] xauron42: Yea not syaing your wrong, but the mmo community itself has grown pretty toxic
[4:54:59] Sollice: They HAD to show AoC though since it's not backed by anyone but its own money
[4:55:02] thunder993: wow should do the same with expansions
[4:55:03] aikopooh: LUL
[4:55:05] Dimitrios90: TRUE LUL
[4:55:08] Sollice: They had to show people the game so they could intake more money
[4:55:15] raldrik: towGold towUnforch
[4:55:19] Penguinslol: towUnforch towUnforch towUnforch
[4:55:21] MrKhanes: So true! we can hope more mmo devs do what they did.
[4:55:33] Shugaze: wonder why we as community became so jaded and negative about up and coming MMOs
[4:55:40] Mozzi_IRL: lmao!
[4:55:43] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: D:
[4:55:48] Wildside1177: Adjust methods to the environment. The internet is a complete cesspool. Avoid it until ready.
[4:56:07] Artivicii: truuuuuuuuu
[4:56:15] Balkidar: Lol... Thank you but also, fuck you. thats the community
[4:56:17] ZakuzaGB: they shouldnt even announce the game is coming out until its  at a solid BETA stage
[4:56:21] aikopooh: well thats how ppl now are days
[4:56:21] ShadoodHD: mfers dont even play the game to begin with KEKW
[4:56:23] Jm3llow: New World plays almost identically to ESO
[4:56:30] Shugaze: RIOT games MMO, wonder where thats going
[4:56:34] ZakuzaGB: games get way too hyped up these days and it ruins them
[4:56:34] codedizle: I hated eso at launch now it's great LUL
[4:56:45] Sollice: everyone hated ESO at luanch lol
[4:56:48] thiccsushi: we wont hear shit about riots mmo for another like 3 or so years
[4:56:52] jbeastb: I want an MMO version of Valheim lol
[4:56:55] ezxistence: I might not even do TBC if Myth of Empires, Atlas wipe coming
[4:57:00] Shugaze: most of the ESO hate is the horrible animations that break immersion
[4:57:05] sharpps: Well Blizzard defo got something going for them with always being able to announce stuff for either retail or classic
[4:57:08] ezxistence: ESO was great
[4:57:11] LegoCoin: I still play ESO, FFXIV and WOW atm
[4:57:13] stratiss: ESO has made a hell of a comeback. Ton of players
[4:57:16] Dreadscore: aoc was announced in 2018 right?
[4:57:16] Mozzi_IRL: I hope AoC is good
[4:57:25] ezxistence: ESO at launch was amazing
[4:57:28] ShadoodHD: jokes on you, one single mention of mmo will trigger the community Kappa_nation
[4:57:29] Artivicii: what errors
[4:57:30] Bullviine: if anything RIOT is our only hope on a decent MMO game, #
[4:57:36] ShadoodHD: Kappa
[4:57:37] king_julian_96: So if bc prepatch is may 18 when do you think we will actually get actual bc classic
[4:57:49] Sollice: Again.....Riot doesn't have to show their game anytime soon. They have that Tencent money to do what they want. AoC doesn't ( by choice ) have that luxory
[4:57:50] Shugaze: i hope that RIOT mmo isnt related to league
[4:57:50] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[4:57:59] Dreadscore: god i hope not, the upcoming alpha 1 should be NDA free right? which means anyone can stream it?
[4:58:07] ezxistence: New World is more comprable to Guildwars
[4:58:10] thiccsushi: @Dreadscore I think it was like 2016 it was suppose to launch alphas in 2018/2019/2020 etc
[4:58:10] ultimaflarestar: Trusting Riot to put out a good game when they can't even keep league players happy
[4:58:11] SonofHorus82: shit I still play LOTRO. Sad that the new lotr mmo got cancelled.
[4:58:18] Shugaze: yea New World is doing big changes since last time i played
[4:58:29] ronin_c137: @hbsumo its already confirmed to be pn league lore
[4:58:31] Dreadscore: pay 500USD lol
[4:58:38] CloudPants8081: forsenE
[4:58:42] shinas: lmao
[4:58:43] Artivicii: holy shit
[4:58:45] eldacal: it was beaufitul on the very first alpha i played it
[4:58:47] Shugaze: @ronin_c137 damn.. atpFeelsBeardMan

[4:58:52] Artivicii: bruh thats a lot
[4:58:52] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[4:58:54] ShadoodHD: ... so like star citizen
[4:58:56] LegoCoin: I have it :-)
[4:58:57] ShadoodHD: Keepo
[4:58:58] Dreadscore: it's 500 i looked it up
[4:58:58] raldrik: Yeah gotta pay to test. What a backwards ass world we live in
[4:58:59] Ambersulfr: They set the price point high enough that you feel vested and don't want to bash it.
[4:59:02] thiccsushi: @Towelliee The steven guy said he would give asmon a bunch of keys might wanna hit him up during that time if you dont have one LULW
[4:59:04] shinas: star citizen is cheaper LUL
[4:59:32] acklesdh: KEKW
[4:59:32] CritcobainTV: MEMW
[4:59:42] MrKhanes: I cant wait to see you play it @Towelliee so we finally can see what type of game AoC is.
[4:59:43] Klauzzer: RI OMEGALUL T
[4:59:51] AureliusXV: i hop riot mmo is good
[4:59:53] Bullviine: we ll said Towelllie
[4:59:55] AureliusXV: hope
[4:59:55] Aidler: 500 bucks to play a alpha. hmmm sounds fishy
[4:59:55] kokochris: Im really enjoying ESO
[4:59:56] Shugaze: can we blame blizz for ALWAYS releasing some content whenever a new MMO comes around?
[5:00:01] Hellbenderer: does AoC have a trinity system?
[5:00:02] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: why did they need a kickstarter tho and why would anyone give amazon money
[5:00:03] thunder993: I feel like ashes is getting too much hype before anyone has seen a thing
[5:00:11] SonofHorus82: @Sollice I was interested to see where they were going to go and what era we would get.
[5:00:16] Bullviine: The Hype that is out there for AOC is the same as when Warhammer Online came out
[5:00:22] piratechris: @HBsumo We don't have to worry about that for the duration of SL
[5:00:23] Bullviine: and that failed abd
[5:00:25] Bullviine: *bad
[5:00:28] thiccsushi: Not only is ashes over hyped mfers spent thousands on a game that hasnt released from buying up all the cosmetics
[5:00:35] Klauzzer: hot damn
[5:00:37] Ambersulfr: @HBsumo I don't. If the MMO can't compete with WoW then they didn't have a lot of hope anyway.
[5:00:40] Wrizzik: $400. What is this; Star Citizen?
[5:00:50] Dreadscore: you can't find it at their shops rn,  but im telling you it was and will be 500usd

[5:00:51] Sollice: @SonofHorus82 Yep would have been good. Especially with the hype building for the TV show. A lot of free press they could have gotten for the MMO
[5:00:56] shinas: i think they showed too much and i honestly dont see much progres compared to 1 or 2 years ago. The BR looked better than the stuff they show currently @Towelliee
[5:00:58] im_n0t_jezus: AOC going to be like the new star citizen imo
[5:01:00] belaham: last time I looked they didn't have a paid for alpha one anymore but that was like 6 months ago.
[5:01:04] CloudPants8081: forsenKek
[5:01:11] Dreadscore: and the thing is they dont even need the money dude
[5:01:15] cschwartzy: 2023 lol
[5:01:17] MIKEBRASKA: its actually a good video, just has a click baity title
[5:01:25] Shugaze: @Ambevsulfr the issue with wow is for most of us our lifestyle and our character invested for years
[5:01:26] Jm3llow: Bruh watch the damn video before you take shit out of context with a title LUL
[5:01:27] stratiss: is it josh? if so the video is good
[5:01:27] Sollice: @Dreadscore Who doesnt need the money?
[5:01:32] Dreadscore: aoc
[5:01:35] stratiss: steven commented on the video
[5:01:42] LegoCoin: You can only get into Alpha Two now for $375
[5:01:51] remixonfire91: he looks like you man KEKW
[5:01:58] Bullviine: @Towelliee DO you liek th elook of AOC? what they have shown? Dont you think it looks like EQ2?
[5:01:59] MIKEBRASKA: the premise is, stop hyping it so hard that it automatically disappoints regardless of how good it is
[5:02:01] Immhey: LUL
[5:02:09] thunder993: he says things people want to hear, will see if it's true
[5:02:11] Sollice: Yeah....but ultimatley what do we think about car salesman... Slimey scuzzy and forceful lol
[5:02:13] Ambersulfr: @HBsumo people our age, yea. There are a ton of teenagers coming up into the gaming sphere every single year that don't give a flying fuck about WoW.
[5:02:15] CritcobainTV: I don't even drive and I'd buy a car from him LUL
[5:02:17] ezxistence: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:02:22] king_julian_96: I don’t think anyone will care then cause the next expac for wow should be out by then

[5:03:26] CritcobainTV: Hey josh, this is why you're a fucking idiot" KEKW
[5:03:28] Mcfailadin: NotLikeThis
[5:03:37] Immhey: He is too defensive.
[5:03:46] Jm3llow: @Towelliee Watch the video before you take it out of context. The video is defending the game and telling people to reign in their expectations...
[5:03:50] Riggoz1: to much hype is tough if it has a bad launch
[5:03:59] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[5:03:59] ZakuzaGB: saying like wow i like the graphics etc is different to hyping up to the point of making it seem like wowkiller 50.0
[5:04:05] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: being defensive is asking to get attacked
[5:04:05] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:04:08] MIKEBRASKA: gotta commend the guy for sticking to his guns though lol
[5:04:11] CritcobainTV: HeyGuys
[5:04:14] Shugaze: @Ambevsulfr yea you are right, but are teens even interested in MMOs in general?
[5:04:16] Bullviine: Steven is no different from the guy who hugely hyped Warhammer online back in the days when that was announced and launched.
[5:04:17] Sollice: @Jm3llow He isn't taking anything out of context? He read the title of the video and read the comments. He isn't talking about the context of the video
[5:04:21] kokochris: god damn love this music track
[5:04:23] LegoCoin: $375 for Alpha 2 but not sure if you can get in Alpha 1 anymore
[5:04:31] Dreadscore: people bash on wow all the time i dont see Ian tweeting all over
[5:04:34] MrKhanes: I couldnt find a pack for alpha 1
[5:04:42] CritcobainTV: POGGERS
[5:04:45] Dreadscore: @Towelliee alpha 1 in not available for purchase yet
[5:04:47] codedizle: I really like the new companion system coming to eso and the endeavor system so you'll be able to actually earn crown creates in game
[5:04:48] CloudPants8081: forsenKek
[5:04:49] br0fest0r: yeah fuck that
[5:04:52] Klauzzer: lol
[5:04:54] shinas: thats a huge red flag imo
[5:04:55] PokerFaceMoose: they dont have a thing to buy a1 atm, but said they will re add it
[5:05:00] PokerFaceMoose: re add an option*
[5:05:00] ZakuzaGB: who in their right mind would pay that
[5:05:07] Ambersulfr: @HBsumo not sure... they could be more into mobile games? I run into kids in WoW still.
[5:05:10] thiccsushi: Spending thousands of dollars before a game releases KEKW
[5:05:17] DoodleNoodle: @Towelliee have you moved to a new place?
[5:05:21] Shugaze: Camelot Unchained has been under NDA for a while now
[5:05:26] Klauzzer: :tf: cvHazmat
[5:05:27] Immhey: Steven will come in here if you are about to criticize AoC LUL
[5:05:32] Klauzzer: amogus
[5:05:33] Xsilentghost: if riot mmo is anything like skyrim eso type gameplay I'll be disappointed
[5:05:37] Dreadscore: Steve's gonna comment on this VOD promised LUL
[5:05:39] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: and they even got a kickstarter
[5:05:41] 91Niki: Like imagine if the game never releases. What if it flops and you spend 100s of dollars on in game stuff LUL
[5:05:48] Jm3llow: @Sollice he just made it seem like Steven was defending his game against the maker of the video and that's not the case at all(if you actually watch the video)
[5:05:52] Kinghorn: any sus in chat towF
[5:05:55] CritcobainTV: I'm gonna tweet to him and tell him you're talking about the game KEKW
[5:05:56] Immhey: He is literally everywhere.
[5:06:00] thiccsushi: @Xsilentghost I think it'll be closer to wow style since ghostcrawler is leading it
[5:06:08] shinas: the BR looked better than the current shit
[5:06:10] LegoCoin: yeah I stopped buying all there dam cosmetics - to many cosmetics are just cash grab and no one can get any ing game LUL
[5:06:14] Mecabeast: riot mmo needs to have a system closer to wow than eso or bdo
[5:06:21] DoodleNoodle: !room
[5:06:21] Moobot: @DoodleNoodle Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:06:33] The_Fat_Jedi_: yep
[5:06:34] Artivicii: wildstar KEKW
[5:06:35] Blah206: lol
[5:06:35] ezxistence: Never trust a korean mmo :D
[5:06:41] CritcobainTV: I have trust issues because my dad left FeelsBadMan
[5:06:42] kokochris: As gamers in general. that is true
[5:06:43] SlackerSlack017: true true
[5:06:45] Blah206: @Artivicii Wildstar was a good one
[5:06:50] kokochris: @critcobain danLove
[5:06:54] 91Niki: I just have trust issues period LUL
[5:06:57] codedizle: @mecabeast what kinda system?
[5:06:59] CloudPants8081: tppowerHeresTommy
[5:06:59] thiccsushi: korean mmo = who can swipe their card the hardest
[5:07:01] ultimaflarestar: And yet the mmo community will still overhype itself again
[5:07:04] CritcobainTV: @91Niki same :(
[5:07:06] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: I was born with trust issues
[5:07:11] Dreadscore: wow sux man
[5:07:17] ezxistence: @thiccsushi Its who can swipe for 24 hours x365 days a day... hahahaha
[5:07:24] Dixietwist: wildstar / bless online / FF . and they ask us why were skeptical lol
[5:07:40] kokochris: people will drop off hard if its not amazing content
[5:07:41] Riggoz1: remember when Wildstar tried the hardcore scene... LUL
[5:07:42] Lamp680: Sometimes self created. The community will trash a game that is not "thier" game to the point were the community think it is true.
[5:07:42] dwyanewade23: !room
[5:07:42] Moobot: @dwyanewade23 Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:07:45] thiccsushi: bless online was a known scam tho that failed in 3 regions before it came to steam
[5:07:49] Sollice: I love WoW, but I maintain now matter how much Blizzard does or can listen to us and make changes, WoW is 16 years old. People are just desperate for something new.
[5:07:55] VowelMovement5: ff? isnt that FInal Fantasy
[5:07:58] codedizle: FF? @dixietwist  nothing is wrong with FF lol
[5:08:00] VowelMovement5: thats good game
[5:08:01] ezxistence: Wow should ahve created new 40 man dungeons, fuck retail
[5:08:09] LegoCoin: gud
[5:08:11] Blah206: Is this the no mans sky on pc
[5:08:28] Aravarth: You know, that sounds SUPER sheisty TBH. When a company charges you $500 to play an early alpha -- when the retail game is gonna be maybe $60 -- that's basically the company saying "We want to have a few hardboners pay US to develop the game in advance and then have them provide feedback, rather than pay employees to do the work"
[5:08:29] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee It also depends if any of the leveling things you're doing affect end game, cause 90% of MMO players just play for the end game
[5:08:34] onyx_pupper: would be a good idea when you hit every 10 lvls you do a mini dungeon
[5:08:34] Laluzmia: lol
[5:08:53] Dixietwist: @codedizle  when ff first came out pre RR
[5:08:53] Sollice: It is super schisty, there is no question about it
[5:09:19] Hyper_Real: do I get company stock if I spend the 500?
[5:09:28] Rastailian: @towelliee happy NFL Draft week
[5:09:34] LegoCoin: yeah what cosmetics are they going to give in game. So many are exclusive prior to release
[5:09:36] Ambersulfr: MMOs are a ton of work, and they don't have access to the testing user base WoW does.
[5:09:41] Ambersulfr: WoW gets a ton of free labor from us.
[5:09:41] Blah206: lol
[5:09:47] capnkalland: you mean bitch period
[5:09:53] king_julian_96: Trust issues I get we all have trust issues
[5:09:56] Holysal: yeah
[5:09:56] tomloy: !room
[5:09:57] Moobot: @tomloy Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:09:58] capnkalland: hell yeah brother
[5:09:58] Sollice: Asmon is weird about things though. Blizzard shop release a $20 dollar mount and he want's to blow up Blizz HQ, then he is ok with AOC havign it initially
[5:10:01] thiccsushi: I still think its weird as fuck to pay like 500 to play an alpha of a game
[5:10:05] Rastailian: this Thursday, yup
[5:10:06] Aidler: AoC = "Game as a Service" towLul
[5:10:11] Holysal: looks like Fields is going to drop
[5:10:18] Sollice: like a mount from the blizzard shop is the literal worst thing that could ever happen
[5:10:24] Immhey: I dont like MTX in WoW and AoC has shit tons of it even before the game is playable. LUL
[5:10:30] kaya4tw: there is a lot of community-created content, tools, addons for WoW, which makes WoW the best among MMOs
[5:10:33] Aravarth: Gesundheit
[5:10:42] LeBigNose: Prosit
[5:10:42] ronin_c137: @towelliee when asmon first interviewed steven all he knew was lazypeons video, nothing more.
[5:10:43] CritcobainTV: bless u
[5:10:47] Masqerader: at this rate I am gonna have the same amount kills as u in lootable attempts
[5:10:49] Holysal: they lance or jones is going 3rd
[5:10:53] Holysal: said
[5:10:58] Rastailian: Fields was managing epilepsy
[5:11:02] dredderz: @towelliee, I think it's time you, Asmon, and a few other hardcore wow gents pool your ideas together and make the next big MMO's. :)
[5:11:02] kaya4tw: Any new game wont have this community support in the beginning. Unless the game offers that directly
[5:11:07] S1appadabass: @towelliee Fields is this years "problem" player
[5:11:11] Masqerader: ew
[5:11:21] Sollice: @Towelliee You don't buy in to the 49ers Jones conspiracy theory?
[5:11:26] Masqerader: keep jimmy g
[5:11:32] CMack_72: almost every player from Ohio St is a problem player
[5:11:35] Masqerader: if they're healthy 49ers will be fine
[5:11:46] Yagr6: mac jones was not tested at alabama i woulndt draft a QB from bama
[5:11:46] dreamjag: They are saying trey lance now for sf
[5:11:48] capnkalland: Picking Mac Jones that early is like the Bears taking Trubiskey in 2017...
[5:12:05] Artivicii: im average 4Head
[5:12:09] CritcobainTV: Average? D: Google said i was bigger than average FeelsBadMan
[5:12:16] Blah206: for the people <3
[5:12:33] jerexify: @Towelliee Do you still have that Alliance character on Bloodmyst that needed a port?
[5:12:53] Shugaze: da bears
[5:13:12] Mallaes: I'm feeling like a squeaky toy atm because of the new R&C trailer :V
[5:13:12] jerexify: @Towelliee I can jump on my Mage if you want to log onto that one next.
[5:13:39] pavepawns: OH YE BOOOIS GUESS WHO JUST GOT TIMELESS PROTO DRAKE
[5:13:42] Dreadscore: can't get the new plagufall mount :(

[5:13:56] Masqerader: lol it's not like they passed on mahomes or watson that draft... oh wait
[5:13:58] Ambersulfr: The PF mount will get a lot easier.
[5:13:59] Holysal: @Dreadscore why not?
[5:14:06] Dreadscore: i suck lol
[5:14:15] Dreadscore: can't solo as prot warr
[5:14:17] Holysal: just kill the last 2 bosses

[5:14:24] CritcobainTV: Just suck the teet. FeelsGoodMan
[5:14:29] Holysal: @Dreadscore oh
[5:14:45] Masqerader: wait till august for gamescoms
[5:14:48] RaysFTW: Every expac starts out fun for me until I realize solo play means I can't do much of anything so I start farming old content again until I get bored and quit again.
[5:14:52] Mecabeast: as an avg player that only gets a few hours a day to play its difficult to gear and catch up with mid or late patch.
[5:14:57] Immhey: 500$ wtf?
[5:14:58] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: give back money? it's amazon Kappa
[5:15:00] RageDriven: Did you move or on vacation Towelliee?

[5:16:33] RaysFTW: @RaysFTW I've never played but I really want to. At this point I'm just waiting for D4 to try it out. anneChamp
[5:16:38] fistofnature: LUL
[5:16:40] Lycis: True
[5:16:53] Ambersulfr: The companies shouldn't be posting on vids because it increases their visibility.
[5:16:56] RaysFTW: omg, first time i use the reply fuction and I reply to myself . Sadge
[5:17:01] verentnarv: let the game do the talking
[5:17:03] Kittastrophe: who is bigger square enix or blizzard?\
[5:17:05] SlackerSlack017: doesnt ffxiv acknowledge the areas they are lacking at
[5:17:13] stratiss: that's what makes Steven different though, he's involved with mmorpg community
[5:17:20] cbiskit89: YoshiP would try to fix something if you criticized it in ffxiv
[5:17:20] Holysal: yeah
[5:17:21] Immhey: Cuz Ion got his job criticizing the game in the first place.
[5:17:22] Ambersulfr: You can sort of thread, but it's awkward.
[5:17:23] thiccsushi: With ions preach interview tomorrow I wonder how often he will pop evasion CD
[5:17:23] RaysFTW: Yes, that's what I tried and failed at. LUL
[5:17:24] Lycis: But those are established mmos not like New World or AoC LUL
[5:17:25] CADZtv: yes
[5:17:27] Artivicii: oof toxic
[5:17:35] Holysal: @RaysFTW here is a reply lol
[5:17:36] magemaster225: how much groaning is gonna happen with the preach interview tomorrow, that other interview this weekend was kinda rough
[5:17:39] ultimaflarestar: YoshiP tells you to stop playing his game if you're not having fun, and would try to fix what you didn't like about the game, he's the best
[5:17:46] Lycis: Yea what could go wrong LUL
[5:17:53] Dreadscore: FAR future
[5:17:53] Ambersulfr: I don't like the threading because you end up losing track of the rest of chat.
[5:17:53] RaysFTW: @RaysFTW Is this reply to you? lol
[5:17:57] codedizle: YoshiP is great ya
[5:17:59] ZakuzaGB: let the game being good be your defence
[5:17:59] CADZtv: ashes always loooked like a cap to me

[5:18:54] Fawcheddar: I see youre mount farming - SL not doing so hot?
[5:19:03] Holysal: @RaysFTW bc you it was the first comment is why
[5:19:04] Immhey: Ion will be fine. He has pretty thick skin.
[5:19:07] Immhey: LUL
[5:19:15] Lycis: LUL
[5:19:17] CritcobainTV: bro im dead ass making popcorn
[5:19:19] RaysFTW: @RaysFTW Oh okay, so it just tags my name in each one, including my replies, I guess.
[5:19:20] Masqerader: @Fawcheddar he beat 1st raid, no mount from mythic boss, why keep doing it?
[5:19:22] raldrik: towUnforch towGold
[5:19:24] CADZtv: ion has a big trunk to- anyway
[5:19:27] S1appadabass: That man is Neo
[5:19:28] CritcobainTV: You HAVE to have thick skin to be in the public eye for that
[5:19:30] RhoSigmaPhi: do u think ppl would be as mad over the game if it was free and u only had to pay sub
[5:19:30] Wildside1177: I wouldn't.
[5:19:32] Putcride: hes a l former awyer

[5:19:50] Masqerader: that or aoe cap
[5:19:50] Thoreya: if they removed conduit energy
[5:19:51] ChhmaCat: it's not that they should be concerned about damaging thier thick skin...  It's that they see what pisses people off.
[5:19:59] thiccsushi: conduit energy is so fucking dumb
[5:20:07] RhoSigmaPhi: for example in league of legends when riot fucks up, ppl aren't that mad cuz the game is free
[5:20:15] ZakuzaGB: who did the previous interview?
[5:20:17] ChhmaCat: I wish more than anything they would address BOTS personally
[5:20:19] Danning: wait, what is conduit energy? im noob
[5:20:25] RaysFTW: Genuine question, how do you make the game more accessible to all types of players while still rewarding those that put in a ton of time and effort to do the hardest stuff?
[5:20:29] pavepawns: if they made covenants available to all how much would ppl freak in chat?
[5:20:29] Thoreya: people are gonna be out for blood LUL LUL

[5:21:09] thiccsushi: @Danning Think like if you had 10 charges and everytime you changed a talent you used a charge. If you wanna swap specs you will drain charges quick and you only get 1 charge a day
[5:21:10] RageerPLZ: @Towelliee is it true China get's guaranteed drops for raid? something to do with anti gambling laws?
[5:21:22] Lycis: Every time his eye twitch when he says Delay LUL
[5:21:25] magemaster225: nah theyll just give us 20 energy now XD
[5:21:32] ChhmaCat: They kinda have crap systems and then they change them and everyone PRAISES blizzard  It's certainly by desing
[5:21:34] Danning: @thiccsushi ohhh yeah, for sure. gotcha. lol thank you
[5:21:35] Riggoz1: why we even had to waste time on energy is just a huge disconnect that people have asked since beta lol
[5:21:42] Ambersulfr: That conduit energy thing does drive me insane, so I would also be happy to see it be yeeted.
[5:21:44] Mecabeast: maybe some questions on the built in io score to not skip pushing on certain weeks
[5:21:47] RaysFTW: @RaysFTW In a sense but I wouldn't say doing LFG raids only makes the game accessible to all.
[5:21:51] shinas: you think the delay is mainly due to covid? other mmos dont seem to be that effected on it
[5:21:54] strike879: conduit energy needs a craftable consumable so you can swap when ever but its less then brb need to swap for just this boss
[5:21:54] Ambersulfr: Trying to play PVE/PVP Resto and Ele is so stressful
[5:21:59] Artivicii: oooo yea
[5:22:00] Artivicii: true
[5:22:02] Masqerader: ya
[5:22:03] DrakeDuude: ya
[5:22:06] Thoreya: a 9.1 release date would be nice :)
[5:22:07] Artivicii: m+content pls
[5:22:07] Sunstepgg: seasonal affix will be anima powers is my bet
[5:22:08] SonofHorus82: Anima WQs will give 40 Anima instead of 35.
[5:22:14] Quimby54: @shinas other mmos have smaller patches more often
[5:22:16] CritcobainTV: I just wanna know when we're gonna get player housing so i can invite my girl Sylvanas over
[5:22:18] luckfore: hes gonna announce 9.1 is next week :)
[5:22:19] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[5:22:25] Masqerader: Maybe more info on adjusting storming/spiteful
[5:22:26] shinas: @Quimby54 which i prefer
[5:22:28] verentnarv: dealing with sylvanas on 9.1 seems odd, makes it seem like the jailer will be in 9.2, similar to wod.
[5:22:31] thiccsushi: that sylvanas bow tho Kreygasm
[5:22:31] shinas: personally LUL
[5:22:40] Akoudadis: @Towelliee when should i come back forrr 9.1? :D Also new streaming room when?
[5:22:51] twistedstick1: towQueen towQueen
[5:22:57] altieri43: This is first time I quit wow in last 5 years
[5:23:02] dracullus: if all tokens were changed from 35  to 40, it would be pretty big actually
[5:23:17] SonofHorus82: what time is the interview tomorrow?
[5:23:19] Sandman_88: @critcobain meanwhile in ffxiv.
[5:23:21] ezxistence: Dear Toweliee,    Ive noticed a recent trend on twitch of kiddy pools and floatable s, when can we expect a Toweliee kiddy pool stream with forehead signatures
[5:23:28] codedizle: @critcobain I've been wanting housing and a complete profession rework for years now I doubt it will ever happen LUL
[5:23:46] Masqerader: I imagine the interview will go like this, Preach ask a question, Ion answers and Preach tears up
[5:23:46] RaysFTW: I just wish there wasn't such a huge leap in gear impact in pvp. PVP is not enjoyable whatsoever as a more casual player when gear makes fights impossible regardless of skill.
[5:23:47] Sandman_88: @altieri43 good stuff, play something more worthy of your time.
[5:23:50] gold9871: wich is around 19:00 eu time
[5:23:52] capncolbeer: another stat squish
[5:24:15] Riggoz1: should their be the next xpac announced this year later?
[5:24:29] twistedstick1: The garrisons is the only housing we will ever get.
[5:24:31] Masqerader: Preach gets all aggressive, Ion claps back "heard you got benched for your Sire kill"
[5:24:33] LecterSRK: @RaysFTW yeah i agree. there should be a difference but not this huuge gap. i feel like i cant even tickle anyone with my 205 gear
[5:24:37] shinas: in a few year stat squishes will be every patch LUL
[5:24:37] RaysFTW: way too soon to talk about the next expac.
[5:24:40] rhodeini: hey
[5:24:45] codedizle: garrisons isnt even close to housing tho LUL
[5:24:48] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[5:24:52] Mecabeast: I might go see it this weekend
[5:24:52] lellongg: !room
[5:24:52] Moobot: @lellongg Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:24:53] codedizle: it's not housing lmao
[5:24:54] SonofHorus82: Kano was SO baller in the new movie.
[5:24:55] thecynicalshuffler: kano is the GOAT
[5:24:56] Shadowlemur01: Id kill for some housing man
[5:24:59] ezxistence: kano was priceless
[5:25:00] magemaster225: noob saibot inc
[5:25:02] Kittastrophe: everyone's favorite foul mouth aussie
[5:25:02] hrdstylem: "i knew id get mine first' rofl
[5:25:06] CritcobainTV: Kano was my favorite fucking part of MK 100%
[5:25:10] DrakeDuude: too many spoilers on mc. ill combat another time
[5:25:14] seo1978: Why did they destroy Legion transmog/mount farming and then lie saying they hadnt had specific examples and its always been like this?...when it hasnt...my favourire thing to do at end of tier is broken.
[5:25:21] ZakuzaGB: ELLO baby did u miss me
[5:25:29] ezxistence: true
[5:25:30] Broomba: watched first MK last night -- cheezy and interesting, got the second one and new one to watch @towelliee
[5:25:31] onyx_pupper: People were getting mad cause he wasnt super muscular
[5:25:35] AcidAbyss: everyone on twitter just a bunch of hipsters waiting to talk trash about a popcorn flick
[5:25:35] Knocx: she doesnt have a mark, kano in the background WHOMP WHOMP
[5:25:43] seo1978: not class, raid mounts etc
[5:25:45] crazypowah: @Towelliee movie was such a disapointment
[5:25:45] Glozki: you can
[5:25:50] seo1978: scaling is way off
[5:25:55] magemaster225: raid scaling in legion still messed up
[5:25:56] RaysFTW: @LecterSRK Exactly. I almost exclusively pvp and as a solo player but I'm screwed by the guy doing mythics and jumps into pvp for shit and giggles.
[5:26:12] seo1978: he said he wanted specific examples
[5:26:25] Masqerader: aggramar, mythic gul'dan is still rough
[5:26:26] dalaraz: @Towelliee you can check simplearmory for easyer mount viewage
[5:26:27] thunder993: I can solo guldan mythic, didnt try argus
[5:26:27] seo1978: we should be able to do it by end of Shadowlands lol
[5:26:28] Kinghorn: it fucking sucks
[5:26:29] luckfore: you cant
[5:26:36] Mecabeast: I don't remember wow stuff being so difficult
[5:26:45] Mecabeast: wod*
[5:26:46] CritcobainTV: Should be able to farm it at the start of Shadowlands, fuck the end of it
[5:26:47] pavepawns: poor blackhand during bfa
[5:26:50] Kinghorn: I would love to farm legion shit
[5:26:51] seo1978: it's a big past time for many people
[5:26:52] LecterSRK: yeah and them telling us nothing changed is the infuriating part
[5:26:54] nilachip: wait KJ is still hard ?
[5:26:58] mirreftw: It's so dumb. Legion raids should be easy as fuck
[5:27:05] tb3763: Just because thats how its always been doesnt mean its wrong now that you cant...
[5:27:06] Riggoz1: yes KJ is very hard unless you are an DH and cheese it
[5:27:06] capncolbeer: level squish messed that up
[5:27:07] Sarole: vape device and ejuice ?
[5:27:08] panzmat: you can kill pretty much everything now except KJ..
[5:27:10] Sandman_88: thats awful design
[5:27:13] TweakT: blizzardians dont want peepo to farm old raids for golde
[5:27:15] seo1978: being released as 'content' in 9.3?
[5:27:19] TweakT: thats what I did for entirety of bfa
[5:27:22] Armdel: wasn't one of the theories that the gear ilvl scaling is applying to legion stuff
[5:27:34] thiccsushi: They know its fucked but just dont want to say it
[5:27:35] LecterSRK: legacy scaling will be the next big content patch LUL
[5:27:43] Masqerader: like u can't do soulhunter because he constantly puts u to sleep, than there is eonar
[5:27:44] Riggoz1: I have.. nothings changed

[5:27:44] pavepawns: nope
[5:27:48] panzmat: my DK can solo each boss except the ones where it forces you to have multiple people, like Eonar
[5:27:48] luckfore: i tried its the same as live
[5:28:08] Mecabeast: I've seen some of the kj avatar and guldan solos and they were rough, taloc in uldir I was having struggles with too on normal
[5:28:08] Kinghorn: legacy scaling and a selfie cam update LecterSRK the big 9.2
[5:28:23] seo1978: i can do a lot on main but not all my lats are 226
[5:28:23] pavepawns: i can solo mythic kj but its rly hard
[5:28:28] seo1978: alts*
[5:28:30] LecterSRK: @Kinghorn PauseChamp wow saved?
[5:28:30] thunder993: you can solo it as dh probably
[5:28:34] CritcobainTV: I wasn't able to kill fucking Avatar because he destroyed the platform fast AF and the lava damage DESTROYS you
[5:29:02] inj0shwetrust: Also is Legion going to become Timewalking at some point ?
[5:29:02] Kittastrophe: return of mage tower would be nice
[5:29:06] luckfore: i tried nyalotha mythic, we didnt even get passed maut lol
[5:29:08] Hot_Hard_Cowboy: is it possible to solo eonar?
[5:29:19] Coofieeee: i've never played wow. i always wonder if its a good time to start but just hearing how much people are dissapointed with it makes me think twice about it
[5:29:26] luckfore: with 20
[5:29:30] CritcobainTV: Oof
[5:29:33] paradoxyy: ASmon did mythic nyalotha they cleared full
[5:29:38] Kinghorn: it should later in this expansion inj0shwetrust
[5:29:38] Riggoz1: lets try lol
[5:29:41] CritcobainTV: Maut was easy as balls even in BFA KEKW
[5:29:44] luckfore: we were 20 ppl with 200+ ilvl
[5:29:44] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:29:47] nilachip: lets try it
[5:29:49] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee lets do it Kappa
[5:29:50] Mecabeast: that's a mechanics issue then
[5:30:06] Aaradin: asmon did it and cleared it
[5:30:16] nilachip: refusing good content
[5:30:22] pavepawns: soloing kj on mythic took me a while cause i kept fckin up the shadow orbs falling down
[5:30:23] Broomba: lets throw asmon a party then
[5:30:24] RaysFTW: @Coofuh the people disappointed have mostly played it a lot and for years so they will expect something different than a first-timer. It's a fun game but if you never played maybe try classic first?
[5:30:25] Riggoz1: I think Asmon had all 225+ players right?
[5:30:41] CritcobainTV: So you're saying we're not good enough? FeelsBadMan

[5:30:43] luckfore: true, but at the start of BFA Antorus mythic was already easy with a pug. Scaling is just fucked
[5:30:51] Spaede: people probably just werent wearing heart of azeroth with essences. Its not bad
[5:30:59] atmfees: asmon's group was a complete mess on nzoth
[5:31:02] Broomba: asmon can sit at start of raid and be carried
[5:31:05] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: whot level ?! SoonerLater
[5:31:17] Gurtington_: he's always carried then says he wasn't carried
[5:31:31] piratechris: Scaling is not good and also the gold farming from old raids etc... not so much anymore
[5:31:31] Mecabeast: I was soloing mythic antorus during 8.3 then prepatch wrecked it
[5:31:50] RaysFTW: I think I threw out my Heart of Azeroth when SL came out because I was so done with that whole freaking concept.
[5:31:53] CADZtv: @Broomba funny every time i see him raiding hes leading and doing mechenics
[5:31:58] Kromede: pepeMeltdown
[5:32:00] Masqerader: i went and finished the 20 pvp daily wq in legion for the mount recently
[5:32:19] Glozki: finally down to two more class mounts that achiev on the broken shore is such a pain
[5:32:20] Broomba: lol @CadzFPS really? now but at beginning of raid hes being carried
[5:32:31] ultimaflarestar: It's next year the and next expansion is about to come out, Legion scaling is still fucked and blizzard continue to claim it's fine Kappa
[5:32:33] Kinghorn: you dont have the druid flight form?
[5:32:35] BarthelemeusNL: 4 days
[5:32:38] Broomba: he doesnt raid or mythic raid anymore
[5:32:38] S1appadabass: not that long
[5:32:38] Kinghorn: you must
[5:32:39] fistofnature: a few hours
[5:32:39] SonofHorus82: I think I only have Paladin and Mage.
[5:32:40] Kromede: forever
[5:32:46] Kinghorn: kk
[5:32:53] thiccsushi: balance of power should be acc wide by now
[5:32:54] George2001k: How hard should an item be to obtain that allows you to set a teleport point anywhere on the Warcraft universe?
[5:32:55] Masqerader: if u did all the broken shore shit
[5:32:56] CritcobainTV: LUL diabetes owl guy
[5:32:57] BarthelemeusNL: you are timed gated by the mission board
[5:33:03] DreamIV: Like 2-3 days
[5:33:05] CADZtv: @Broomba how do you get carried if your leading and last one dead in hes groups that he makes that are pugs?
[5:33:08] RaysFTW: Diabetes cocoon guy owl-looking dude.
[5:33:10] jerexify: @Towelliee When you need the part that requires Mark of the Sentinaax, let me know. I have a bunch of beacons saved in my bank.
[5:33:11] DreamIV: The missions hold everything up
[5:33:11] Rastailian: Wilfred Brimley lol
[5:33:12] Masqerader: @Towelliee if u did all the broken shore shit and class campaign its quick
[5:33:12] Glozki: have to wait for WQ on broken shore is a big timegate
[5:33:12] tb3763: 4 days is nothing....
[5:33:13] Aidler: we can always do the legion stuff in a few years once Legion Classic is out towLul
[5:33:13] George2001k: It would be an awesome item to get though
[5:33:21] Broomba: @CadzFPS when raid opens up hes being carried
[5:33:26] CADZtv: @Broomba btw im not saying hes the best player btw
[5:33:37] nerd__life: !ROOM
[5:33:37] Moobot: @Nerd__life Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[5:33:50] xxOgre22xx: walter brimley is a tuskarr, not a druid mount lol
[5:33:53] Artivicii: lmfao
[5:34:00] piratechris: Man classic Legion servers.. now that would be something
[5:34:00] Artivicii: HAAAAA
[5:34:00] DreamIV: If it wasn’t for the mission board you could do it in one day for class mounts
[5:34:05] AcidAbyss: yep
[5:34:05] RageDriven: THE BEETUS
[5:34:06] CritcobainTV: LUL

[5:34:18] jerexify: @Towelliee When you need the part that requires Mark of the Sentinaax, let me know. I have a bunch of beacons saved in my bank.
[5:34:26] Chiraakitteh: From the movie Cocoon
[5:34:27] SonofHorus82: @RaysFTW He was in a movie called Cocoon a loooooong time ago.
[5:34:27] CritcobainTV: By the Light of Diabeetus D:
[5:34:34] RaysFTW: from diabeetus?
[5:34:44] Broomba: Our House granddad -- @towelliee you remember that show?
[5:34:46] SumZeroGG: He gone
[5:34:48] RaysFTW: @SonofHorus82 Ah, okay. lol
[5:34:51] LecterSRK: he died august 2020
[5:35:03] CADZtv: @Broomba are you basing this purely on item level he recruits or how they perform?
[5:35:05] CushyPop: He also looks like every Tuskarr in the game
[5:35:07] Dixietwist: wilford brimley
[5:35:23] thirdmoonbrew: Died: August 1, 2020
[5:35:29] Broomba: @CadzFPS thats been his pattern since cata
[5:35:33] CADZtv: @Broomba cause im basing it on how people perform in his raid and hes always the last one alive
[5:36:03] CADZtv: @Broomba ok so your basing him being carried cause he only gets high ilevel players
[5:36:36] Broomba: players who know the fight and he never raids hard core since a long time unlike towelliee @CadzFPS
[5:36:54] Aidler: @CadzFPS not always towLul
[5:36:57] Broomba: hes always like this since cata

[5:37:36] CADZtv: which are pugs obv
[5:37:47] Kromede: IonJam
[5:37:55] Broomba: long after raid is open and he knows the fight, but during beta, alpha or even raid opens, he waits
[5:38:11] CADZtv: im just curious how hes gets carried when he raid leads these pug groups lol
[5:38:22] Broomba: obviously you havent his pattern since 2012
[5:38:26] S1appadabass: da hell yall arguing about?
[5:38:49] Broomba: @S1appadabass not arguing pointing out that his pattern is always the same
[5:39:01] verentnarv: I mean @cadzfps , most of those pugs he picks are players with mythic ilvl, you don't really need to lead them
[5:39:05] codedizle: just cuz you raid lead doesn't mean you aren't being carried LUL
[5:39:24] CADZtv: @varienus yh ofc but those players are always wiping to

[5:57:25] mavericks312: mk was a good 7/10
[5:57:40] ManiacalCarl: The fighting was...ok. ;) The acting was like watching Lizzie McGuire. Old boy couldn't even get it up, and then in the next scene, he is in charge and telling everyone else what their "matchups" are going to be. My personal opinion.

[7:15:05] Moobot: @xTwoShoes Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[7:15:13] josh8555: The PvP sounds awesome shadows fight under a clan to take over the immortals throne lol
[7:15:34] Vato33: Good examples of mobile mmos switching to get highly p2w and losing customers are L2R and World of Kings
[7:15:45] Jonboto: !ORIGIN
[7:15:47] SpartanAdventus: none of the npc ever expect you to be a live and always sound surprised when you talk to them
[7:16:03] Vato33: Hope Diablo doesnt end up like this, but mobile mmos tend to enjoy the micro transactions
[7:19:04] DollaDSheets: why else would they do mobile if not for the micro transactions

[7:21:12] Vato33: Some of the mobile mmos have potential, World of Kings is basically a copy of WoW, but clearance of end content was only possible with a deep pocket
[7:21:19] hoarci: does this or will this have contoller support? @Towelliee
[7:21:21] Azazelduma: Infinity blade

[7:22:02] Ludicruz: @Towelliee  You playing the game on your phone or on the app on your PC ?
[7:22:09] XenMonkey: If that's the case, why does it need to be on mobile? Surely it would havce been just as effectrive and successful on pc/console?
[7:22:10] 3dRes: What microtransactions are there?
[7:22:26] Vato33: It always starts with a hype, and ends up with a huge disappointment, as more f2p players cant clear content

[7:22:26] remixonfire91: its the same as poe , the game is free but you want to look cool ? spend  80 euros on cosmetics , want more stash tabls ? spend more 50 on those
[7:22:28] josh8555: its alpha
[7:22:40] wilkesy07: this looks like a mobile game
[7:22:46] TheUnknowing: Sure, but then that would defeat the purpose of diablo 4 @XenMonkey
[7:22:46] DollaDSheets: it is
[7:22:52] RogueBear: you'll probably be able to play it completely free but to top the leaderboards and max your resources it'll cost you $
[7:22:57] Vato33: Not sure why no mobile mmo tried monthly subscriptions, as that option is available
[7:23:01] mpmhall: Is this a sponsored stream?
[7:23:04] 3dRes: @wilkesy07 that's because it is...
