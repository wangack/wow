[0:29:25] nbagamer191: Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) is an eye condition in which your cornea — the clear, dome-shaped front of your eye — gets thinner and gradually bulges outward into a cone shape.  A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes. However, it can affect one eye more than the other. It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and 30 years of age. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer

(Not including level time for first month of botting, no clue how long it takes for a bot to level up)  Since gametime share between games, and the classic versions has no upfront cost the botfarms can scale exponentially
[2:15:12] earlyseasoneric: @JokerdTV so the weapon enchant was more expensive then 1 wow token?

[6:28:17] kaffe_re_re_reformed: @Harleybane are u a polish toilet cleaner working 16 hours 2 times a day?

[6:28:31] LightBladeStream: @Harleybane so you dont care about wow, your other hobbies are more important to you ok
[6:28:34] melvinguyy: the only thing that sucks is rolling on the tier pieces with 9 other ppl, but that will get a lot easier from now when ppl get more pieces
[6:28:35] kaffe_re_re_reformed: @Harleybane also, you have multiple hobbies - you CHOSE to spend your time on other things. whats the issue?
[6:28:41] dysgenic1: what is your budget for raid @JokerdTV  ?

[6:29:45] grumbles28: The problem is there isnt a big enough sample size for it to even out. If you roll on the chest every lockout against 6 people its very possible to lose the roll 20 times in a row.

[6:31:15] Azibex: @Papalotapuss HUHA
[6:31:15] BLUNDERGUN: 100% xp buff is so fucking easy
[6:31:17] Brelshar: Shkek Clap

[6:43:47] nullGod_: realisticly theres nothing else than parsing if gnomeregan is on farm..
[6:44:05] bubblesthebelfwarrior: shaman bear and pally are best solo tanks rn and mage/priest is best solo healing then u can stack 8 dps=buffs is build we found this phase
[6:44:13] WalterweightTV: i mean i just like enjoy my id ,meanwhile,have pink number reconfort a bit, but it not life changer
[6:44:13] callmedillon: Its almost like 10man raids in classic dont work and are dogshit
[6:44:17] gigaroguerin: but just clearing the raid is boring, id rather play something else if not parse focused group tbh, my opinion
[6:44:19] BLUNDERGUN: parsing as ret pally is impossible atm because ACP is required for good single dps KEKW blizzard design
[6:44:27] x_jdot: now ranged hunters are almost treated as second dlass KEKL

[6:45:01] izzylawl: It's alright bro let's goooo
[6:45:02] WalterweightTV: and some player need more time than to enjoy/farm a phase
[6:45:04] Brelshar: Heart of the Lion is probably raid wide because Kings can be raid wide.
[6:45:04] Dissolution187: Whoa the yap
[6:45:04] SpencersanTV: All these parsers should go play retail
[6:45:06] WalterweightTV: than me

[6:46:38] bubblesthebelfwarrior: if less buffs are needed cuase share more then u have a higher chance to get inv a none buff role
[6:46:39] LightBladeStream: Everyone having feral buff is just more fun tho, regardless of optimal

[6:47:02] WalterweightTV: i dont need rogues on my raids tbh
[6:47:03] kartofl910: WHO care rogue's

[6:48:10] infuz10n: give warlocks windfury
[6:48:13] Fenriz25: give wf to rogue and warrior EZ
[6:48:19] Texan_NRV: making item that  bring the buff like the fist weapon in gnomer that give elem curse
[6:48:27] vacerss: its more fun to play warrior with wf
[6:48:34] LightBladeStream: Windfury is way more fun than simply a 5% dmg buff like retail
[6:48:34] MonzonWasTaken: yap
[6:48:34] BLUNDERGUN: paladin really needs a juicer rune buff for raid slots
[6:48:37] Exusprime: is warcraft logs broken or warrior tanks back on top?

[7:08:12] Kujiia: ye think is a good decision, with all the runes system ppls want to try something new it's refreshing
[7:08:13] 0bbie: they didnt add any new ways of getting xp like killing new rare elite mobs or anything, no new quest chains
[7:08:13] grillparty1992: the entire blizzard decision making is terrible, they are rushing everything. SoD p2 has been a disaster to me. hopefully i get cata beta

[7:25:12] torslash12: disband raid no wb
[7:25:14] chrisasaur_: @JokerdTV the strat is to have 1 person move in and out, and range group stays still
[7:25:15] Saynay: 3Head rl
[7:25:20] gdkpgold: kick the mage
[7:25:21] CoolTV: ME NAME ICEBLOX Pepega
[7:25:24] sendhelp111: AAAAAAA
[7:25:25] SNIFFFA: no
[7:25:26] crowbar8: 1 group and a gigachad is all you need
[7:25:26] OnlyRift: 2 groups of 3 thats all
[7:25:27] qiip_fabi: there r 2 tactics
[7:25:27] koffingz96: no
[7:25:28] crowbar8: who ruyns out and in
[7:25:29] CaerToo: That positioning was weird AF
[7:25:31] Dogistyle07: you dont need 6 players moving classic players cant think
[7:25:33] MonzonWasTaken: yap
[7:25:36] CoolTV: YEP
[7:25:36] chrisasaur_: theres different ways to bait the charge
[7:25:37] Saftiest: Melee can soak brother, so the mage soaks it to melee
[7:25:38] 21up21: the mage rl wanted to be group 1 and let melee soak the chains from him while u all be group 2
[7:25:39] uldamanfarmer: demon group
[7:25:43] urmadlife: dont bullly the mage he is just gaming SadgeCry
[7:25:43] Sacha68: just 1 healer need to move forward and backwards check wowhead
[7:25:43] chrisasaur_: you can chain to melee and have 1 person move in and out
[7:25:47] Lancer210: just 1 guys moves.... he makes it either jump to him + melee's.. then he moves in and next goes to caste..
[7:25:48] Seloei: You have one ranged group and one melee and then one healer on melee side runs in and out and controls who gets it
[7:25:49] Humurious: one person takes the debuff to melee
[7:25:50] Altaadela: Yeah so the mage was gonna run long on melee side, so range on moon takes 1, then mage runs out and take it with melee
[7:25:51] Humurious: it’s ez
[7:25:53] daveinspace_: bro its so easy just move the boss between 2 ranged groups stacked on wall and nobody move @JokerdTV
[7:25:53] TheEventGuy: @CoolTV actually your name is Smart Fridge
[7:25:58] Dogistyle07: @chrisasaur_ at least one person with brain
[7:25:58] Narvisia: Steady shot needs to be have a quicker cast time, since it gets the hidden .5 second delay. Maybe would still need weapon damage adjusted too
[7:26:06] gdkpgold: nah just have second tank stacked with 6k soaking the beam alone
[7:26:06] crowbar8: it can be, he runs in with it
[7:26:08] AgentIce99: melee and ranged need to stay in one spot and only 1 healer has to move in and out
[7:26:09] Xeonik11: this strat works by having range on right side of boss and melee on left. the mage just goes in and out for charge and it should go to melee group
[7:26:10] lukersz: ReallyMad WTF NOOB RL, TELL ME TACTICS FOR THIS TUTORIAL RAID (part 2/6)
[7:26:10] Dogistyle07: 1 person is enough moving the whole fight
[7:26:12] Humurious: that is what the range stack is for KEKW
[7:26:19] Seloei: Ranged stands still and takes it when healer runs in. When ranged soaked he runs out to bait  it to melee
[7:26:24] Saiauriel: Start flaming them UltraMad
[7:26:31] Dogistyle07: it is try to think maybe
[7:26:34] bubblesthebelfwarrior: u dont get it lol
[7:26:35] LightBladeStream: 1 person is enough, but demons cant stand correctly
[7:26:37] Altaadela: No they move in so only take every second one
[7:26:38] Humurious: he goes closer than the range stack
[7:26:40] Dogistyle07: he needs to go every second arc only
[7:26:41] bobbobp: the one guy goes furthest, then he runs to melee
[7:26:42] Lancer210: give up. streamer brains don't understand advanced tacts :D
[7:26:42] EldarionDK: Ranged group will be 2nd soakers
[7:26:46] Mystiggo: he won't get targeted 2 times in a row because he moves in for every second one
[7:26:47] Dogistyle07: cause range camp gets first arc
[7:26:48] AgentIce99: he moves back in causing the other healer to be targetted, but only one healer has to move
[7:26:49] Harska: it chains to the melee grp with 1 person moving wich is great strat
[7:26:49] chrisasaur_: no, cause the range group is standing out. the 1 person moving is out ranging or in melee @JokerdTV
[7:26:49] bubblesthebelfwarrior: 1 guy moves making the other guy that didnt move out more
[7:26:52] bubblesthebelfwarrior: 200iq
[7:26:54] ChiliDogLarry: soakers HUHA
[7:26:58] Harska: our healers usually are the only ones moving
[7:26:59] Sacha68: yes
[7:27:00] Saynay: tell them your opinion otherwise they never improve ReallyMad
[7:27:03] daveinspace_: bro its so easy just move the boss between 2 ranged groups and nobody move
[7:27:05] Humurious: knock into wall
[7:27:16] TheEventGuy: ahhh gachiW
[7:27:21] Humurious: aoe behind boss
[7:27:30] AgentIce99: stacks on tank
[7:27:30] Seloei: Aoe debuff on top of tank
[7:27:31] chrisasaur_: theres a safe spot
[7:27:37] Dogistyle07: u make 1 range camp which doesnt have to move cause they get arc anyway and 1 person runs every second arc behind range camp and baits it into melee camp @JokerdTV
[7:27:39] TheEventGuy: i like em big
[7:27:44] G2Gbuyer: what do you think to p2?
[7:28:01] HoppyHippo_: what is naing
[7:28:02] vacerss: why over complicate stuff thats easy

[7:28:38] Ubiitwa: my guild put the ranged in two walls and makes the tank dance the boss around LUL
