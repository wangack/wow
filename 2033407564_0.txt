[0:32:04] Spyke_ZGZ: Also, I watched a video this morning on the Overwatch League, and had Blizzard actually cared about that game/community
[0:32:15] Spyke_ZGZ: I think it would've been bigger than League/Dota
[0:32:25] Rmont: overwatch is the worst game in existence
[0:32:31] Spyke_ZGZ: Because of the devs.
[0:32:58] Rmont: overwatch, where you can be mad even while winning
[0:33:24] Spyke_ZGZ: The first 6 months of Overwatch is still probably my fondest gaming memories.
[0:33:29] Spyke_ZGZ: Right next to PUBG butgs

[0:55:31] OopsiePoopsieD_ZGZ: Theres a new program going around that lets you make any game think you are using a controller when you are using mouse and key... soo, now people have aim assist on mouse and key and its so broken
[0:55:59] Topher_IRL: So they tried to block Cronus and now people are using a software solution
[0:56:00] Topher_IRL: LUL
[0:56:04] OopsiePoopsieD_ZGZ: However, i do understand that program can be used to be helpful for some games, but people are just using it to cheat lol
[0:56:05] Spyke_ZGZ: @OopsiePoopsieD_ZGZ Oh that's not new. That's been around forever. CoD devs just didn't seem to think/care about it being an issue.
[0:56:13] Wombatt_ZGZ: How do I report a strimmer for baiting with puppies and then NOT having the pupper cam active??? ASking for a friend.
