[4:10:55] mulletrocker11358: love it
[4:11:12] floobyttv: they care about TBC right now they could care less about retail
[4:11:12] DoubleNova: the next expansion will be out before 9.1
[4:11:16] Fubarlogixx: i find it insae that it still isnt out and ive paid zero attention to wow all together
[4:11:17] floobyttv: TBC has been extremely successful
[4:11:21] TheUnknowing: honestly the longer it takes the more im losing hype for 9.1 lol
[4:11:48] matt2d2007: i just want the mogs from the new raid lol

[4:11:57] Unciatim: They looked at current 9.1 and said.. welll that will keep them busy for about a month or two... what wil lthey do till 9.2, rls date July 2022...
[4:11:59] KragnosWoW: I went from wanting heroic sylvanas bow to being content on the LFR bow XD
[4:12:02] Naturalbeef: No way they make the 29th. Mid-july seems the closest
[4:12:09] Alepouditsa: yea we are ready for the next one
[4:12:19] grizzlyhorn: ive been a retail randy for a few years and im hard considering quitting shadowlands for tbc
[4:12:19] CritcobainTV: SL could've been amazing if shit came out on time man
[4:12:20] floobyttv: yes... then you have people switching to TBC who are playing 18 hours a day since launch

[4:12:23] Broomba: Blizzard should cut the cord on SL
[4:12:33] iitsmadness: maybe they release 9.2 on june 29th LUL
[4:12:33] JubJubWantRubRubs: i just want Legion 2 with more classhalls questlines FeelsBadMan
[4:12:34] da_moosse: I love shadowlands, I just got bored with the content
[4:12:57] KragnosWoW: People will cope their way through 9.1, they will hate the aesthetic but force themselves to enjoy it
[4:13:01] EggwithEdges: Sylvanas is ony leader I'll follow >:(
[4:13:02] Genric_Tv: I wish covid haven’t ripped shadowlands (if it had anything to do with it)
[4:13:11] Dorky1495: problem with shadowlands, is they are so keen on making the game easy; TBC is more enjoyable cause the content actually feels hard (due to character power)
[4:13:21] Dorky1495: you can do everything in shadowlands yourself, minus raiding and dungeons
[4:13:32] Bernardo994: im not even coming back I just want to know the story
[4:13:35] Broomba: I think SL was doomed to fail: whether it was covid or system user or both
[4:13:42] Aethn: "OK Sylvanas is Dead whats next ... 2 more years of The Maw ... FML"
[4:13:51] Elektrixie: hey,  I'm just glad to have classic to keep my interest
[4:13:53] 28jc: blizzard knows they can rest on the subs from classic
[4:14:03] CritcobainTV: Like i said. I think SL would've been amazing if shit came out on time
[4:14:08] Bernardo994: covenents flopped
[4:14:25] xdrshootemx: @Towelliee  what  keyboard do you use ?
[4:14:35] Lesrek: @Baleroc1 They've already said there isn't a 9.3
[4:14:37] CritcobainTV: I feel like covenants kind of made you forced to play certain things to be competitive for mythic, and that was a problem too
[4:15:06] TheUnknowing: I think shadowlands failure is just the same as WoD at the moment, no content and its had no content just because of the development of 9.1 taking so long
[4:15:27] Lesrek: @Baleroc1 They have said the next raid tier is the last one.  Defeating the jailor is the end.
[4:15:28] Th3Hammer: niceee
[4:15:29] CaptainJoeyNY: my steelseries apex 350 has 2 USB ports on the front, its great
[4:15:36] Lesrek: So 9.3 won't be a raid patch if it exists

[4:21:08] delmoranis: how in the hell lol nice
[4:21:19] Lesrek: @Baleroc1 Sorry, my point wasn't that they've said that 9.3 in not happening, but for it to happen, they'd need another raid tier and they have said that isn't happening
[4:21:21] akia03: @Baleroc1 the new xpax will be out when 9.3 would launch
[4:21:22] buckshot_feast: catJAM
[4:21:28] dracullus: @Mannana96 so you think 9.1 will last full year after 9.0 lasted 7 months and people almost riot? ;D
[4:21:47] stratiss: We getting a release date soon?
[4:21:52] thiccsushi: 9.3 content will probably be put into the new expac just like 9.1 stuff would be pushed into 9.2 because 9.1 looks pretty light weight
[4:21:54] rohdey: is there ever a possibility for 3 year xpac cycle instead of 2?
[4:22:03] dracullus: @Towelliee if there will be 9.3, Anduin most lilkely would be boss of 9.2

[4:22:07] Frank4LuLz: 10.0 LEGION 2?????
[4:22:09] rhodeos_: 9.3 "Here comes the void..do do dodoo"
[4:22:13] matt2d2007: expansion announcement at gamescon like legion?
[4:22:21] BlueBeast33: We need more smaller raids for current WoW, it's disappointing to get only 3 raids for an entire expansion
[4:22:33] KragnosWoW: Lets all agree 9.1 will be better than e3 was this year XD
[4:22:36] Broomba: Don’t think blizzard doesn’t want it to last 2-3 years
[4:22:38] Ricerev: wrath had smaller raids
[4:22:43] Genric_Tv: Blizzard needs to pull a bungie
[4:22:47] Alepouditsa: i am thinking them like junkies that the need the money evry month
[4:22:50] itscityboy: May other mmo's rise during that time
[4:23:02] dracullus: @Mannana96 exactly 7 months next week, and patch is 2-3 weeks away
[4:23:04] SilkeySmooth: retail wont last until nov 2022..lol
[4:23:15] geokouts: Activision : I have and idea! make every patch a DLC being charged 5$!
[4:23:17] BlueBeast33: True, but I still think we need more raids like Trial of Valor
[4:23:21] phyllixprime: imagine shadowlands staying in 9.0 for 2 years then blizz says ok we are done new expansion now
[4:23:23] nchester51: bigger boss raids are always better imo made legion good
[4:23:30] nchester51: and nyalotha
[4:23:30] dracullus: rise? like Wildstar during WoD? ;D

[4:24:33] BadXo: I'm having a great time in FF XIV at the moment - not sure I'll be back to wow at 9.1. Not really missing WoW much at the moment.
[4:24:48] JubJubWantRubRubs: POGGERS
[4:25:32] rohdey: I think people want 1-3, 1-2 boss raids
[4:25:36] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee You think Blizzard are getting sick of putting Sylvanas in everything and now they've decided to kill her off?
[4:25:50] TheUnknowing: at this point, get shadowlands over with, lets go
[4:25:55] PvtHudson093: BFA had 39 raid bosses
[4:25:58] TheUnknowing: give me a legion 2.0
[4:26:14] dracullus: so 9.1 is delayed, but suddently they work "shit ton" on 10.0? I say they is huge chance 10.0 is delayed as well
[4:26:16] BlueBeast33: I just want more smaller raids like Gruul's Lair or Trial of Valor
[4:26:21] rohdey: i thought they only said there wasn't anything 'planned'
[4:26:31] Frank4LuLz: 10.0....LEGION 2
[4:26:44] Korupcija_: @Baleroc1 nice thinking 🤡
[4:26:55] Bernardo994: lol yea let it die
[4:26:56] Fhirn: hopefully they make the next expansion withouth new systems and just hugely improve the old ones
[4:26:59] thiccsushi: Best bet would be throw the good 9.3 ideas into 10.0
[4:27:00] Genric_Tv: @towelliee  do you think blizz should do what bungie did and break ties with activison to save there IP
[4:27:38] Broomba: 9.3 and 10 would be 2 different things: system lore cont, etc incompatible
[4:27:40] westelan_: how was vegas? whatd you get up to?
[4:27:56] thiccsushi: I wish we kept artifact weps and kept building on it tbh
[4:28:03] PrxSick: i think the players should've been the 5th covenant and been able to use anything from whichever covenant

[4:29:01] jerexify: I mean... Where's the lie? lmao
[4:29:02] dracullus: if only he would do that
[4:29:03] jamarky23: What about his wow merch?
[4:29:03] NewWorldReign: New World too, they already impressed me.
[4:29:04] Templexx: you think covid is still valid excuse tho? its been hella long time lol
[4:29:04] LordMorrowbringer: You sound angry about it.
[4:29:08] Galkresh: We can only hope he moves to FF14 forever
[4:29:19] Lesrek: Fucking Bell.  He went from an decent content creator to a terrible youtube clickbate fabricator of drama
[4:29:20] EverestTheFallen: Bellular is the new Zybak
[4:29:21] Zippaya: yeah, WOW is duying and ressurecting every 3,4 months :D
[4:29:22] Folkja: sweeping trikes
[4:29:22] zodd_amhai: imo FF14 is way worse than WoW
[4:29:27] SaltyTunapants: @Towelliee sweeping strikes buff
[4:29:31] keziya: it's 360
[4:29:32] Broomba: @galkresh how about bellular just leave the gaming world
[4:29:33] keziya: and it's awful
[4:29:49] da_moosse: I have yet to find a game that has gripped me like wow did 12 years ago
[4:29:51] Bernardo994: but to squares credit they are on time
[4:29:51] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:29:52] RuthlessWelshy: bellular is clickbaiter extradonaire
[4:29:56] Galkresh: @Broomba equally fine for sure. Lol. So long as he's not in WoW and I don't have to know his content exists I'm good.
[4:29:59] diivil92: zybak thats a name i havent heard in a while
[4:30:03] Bernardo994: even with COVID
[4:30:08] stratiss: when we getting a 9.1 date towelliee
[4:30:17] BlueBeast33: I'm unhappy with Shadowlands like Bellular is and even he is annoying me at this point
[4:30:29] Broomba: And for me if he’s not in wow and ff14
[4:31:08] PvtHudson093: we need that release date to so we can chill out
[4:31:13] Broomba: Just drink that Pepsi zero like bellular does and all is good
[4:31:14] geokouts: we will shut up for like 1 or 2 weeks
[4:31:15] MrsPyra: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:31:16] Tequilawyrm: It's honestly tragic because i think the systems of SL have so much more potential compared to Legion/BFA
[4:31:19] GrizlyInsertion: See, I am glad that I took a break from wow for a couple of years, other than grinding to prep for 9.1, I don't have anything to bitch about.
[4:31:22] LaminatedTV: oddly, i'm still having fun. still do our raid clears every week. some arena and m+. working on old achievements. /shrug
[4:31:33] Galkresh: yep

[4:32:18] warrenny: Tbh tbc is so fun not even sure ill go back to 9.1
[4:32:21] Templexx: new world soon too. either out on that day or b4 id think
[4:32:21] Catspaw66: Wow won't be in trouble as a mmo until you see Taliesen & Evital shilling hard for FF14 LUL
[4:32:35] jamarky23: And then Bellular is gonna be all "the future of wow looks great again"
[4:32:48] jerexify: @Towelliee In your 15+ years of WoW, have you ever gotten to a point where you thought about NOT tanking anymore? I'm really kind of burned out on it... I'm considering a switch.
[4:32:49] maple_butters: Enjoy the streams ! @Aserak your welcome
[4:32:58] Mheerkat: i am playing ff14 because they are diff games tbh
[4:33:01] Genric_Tv: All I here is ff14 is the wow killer and it feels kida over hyped it looks super flashy as well
[4:33:11] ark_faber: FFXIV crafting is crazy good
[4:33:24] zSKIz1: i love how FF14 is getting lots of good hype right now.  it'll bring competition to the MMO genre and competition is ALWAYS good
[4:33:26] Fades1209: Bell's just looking for the next market to profit off of. Any business looks to grow.
[4:33:26] Korupcija_: what are your thought on wow being a seasonal game? @Towelliee
[4:33:34] CritcobainTV: what do you mean? you pushed 2.1k in 2s? Kappa @Towelliee
[4:33:36] zSKIz1: it'll lead to better WoW for us wow players
[4:33:48] Megared25: Ffxiv and wow why can’t we be friends
[4:33:53] Mheerkat: the only thing sure for me as a casual in both games is FF community is well more friendly than wows
[4:33:57] RuthlessWelshy: yeah competition in mmo's is a godd thing
[4:33:59] BlueBeast33: I haven't enjoyed pvp since Cata
[4:34:16] skyshiva28: what nameplates do u use?
[4:34:27] Fades1209: with 9.1, I just hope theyre not holding onto the release date to combat New World's launch. I honestly don't think the game can handle that long of a drought, but with blizzard nowadays you never know.
[4:34:33] Shinjuro: @Towelliee we are supposed to have really hot on friday for us it kinda is 34-35 degrees or so
[4:34:39] zSKIz1: so i'm all for ff14 being big.  allow the 2 to be friends.  wow was like nvidia / intel for so long and took advantage of being king
[4:34:42] imallin1234: Dogs have sunscreen??
[4:34:43] bob2305: the mosquitoes are bad even for dogs also
[4:34:43] ピンドロール: i've played both 14 and WoW for years, and while yes 14's community is friendlier, the bad part of 14's community is the absoulte worst of any gaming community
[4:34:46] zSKIz1: now amd is pushing intel
[4:34:47] KUR0SIVE: ffxiv isnt that like the only jrpg mmo that made it? i dont know many others phantasy star online maybe
[4:34:50] dracullus: @Genric_Tv every MMO on surface is more interesting than after you play it for 15 years, I remember clickbaiters praising Black Desert Online during drought between WoD and Legion
[4:34:53] EverestTheFallen: only 87 here in lakeside
[4:34:56] kashmara: It was 111F last night in Phoenix at 9pm last night
[4:35:05] Genric_Tv: Honestly it scares me when wow is in trouble it’s mainly the only game that can hold my attention and gives me the feel of accomplishment from gaming
[4:35:19] Frank4LuLz: Sylvanas becomes Alliance War chief
[4:35:23] zSKIz1: same @Genric_Tv
[4:35:30] 28jc: ill pocket heal you in wrath pvp
[4:35:30] CritcobainTV: Ret dk hpal Pog
[4:35:38] Megared25: Ff xi is my fave mmo over ffxiv
[4:35:39] zSKIz1: which is why i'm actually very excited FF14 has good hype, it'll lead to a better wow for us
[4:35:40] BlueBeast33: Wrath pvp was great
[4:35:50] KonceptionZ: wow will never die
[4:35:57] zSKIz1: wow won't disappear.  but ff14 competition will lead to a better wow for everyone
[4:36:05] Megared25: Yep
[4:36:06] norseraider23: copium ?

[4:36:24] Genric_Tv: True
[4:36:27] EggwithEdges: Next MMO is the WoW killer ofc
[4:36:31] KonceptionZ: al these new mmo's coming out, blizzard is def taking pages out of their book to improve wow.
[4:36:40] LosingWithStyle: I think it's dumb to suggest wow is in trouble, but this is the first time another game has even come close to WoW.  And FF has been around for years, it's not going anywhere either.

[4:37:22] SteveSD: if wow didnt realize classic's it would be dead
[4:37:23] Megared25: Not In valdrum but valkrum dunes yes pls lol @zodd_amhai
[4:37:26] Clicklesly: WoW2 will kill WoW Kappa
[4:37:26] Fades1209: people used to say that about Everquest. what life would be like without Evercrack for the next fix.
[4:37:30] zSKIz1: we are saying FF14 brings competition to the genre which is good for WoW
[4:37:31] SteveSD: release*
[4:37:36] magemaster225: first tme? dot jpeg
[4:37:38] rsimpson105: I am looking forward to old school DKs in the wrath relaunch
[4:37:38] Dorky1495: @SteveSD ppl been saying that for 17 years my man
[4:37:40] Oopogo1: its more a hope that it will than a belief that it will dethrone wow...ppl get fed up with years of blizzard's crap
[4:37:42] stratiss: I've been playing the alpha it's a fun experience, but you're not gonna get the raid experience out of New World.
[4:37:52] SteveSD: im playing FF11, 10 times better than retail
[4:38:02] SteveSD: game made for gaming , not micro transactions =p
[4:38:02] Frank4LuLz: pac man , zelda
[4:38:07] keziya: wow is basically metallica
[4:38:08] Spykex02: I’ve been having fun playing prot pally for the first time on tbc. I don’t really care about the other stuff.
[4:38:11] manmower: quake
[4:38:14] zodd_amhai: lets see if FF14 will still be dominant 15 years later
[4:38:17] kenzellbtw: if blizzard can retain the elements of tbc classic there will never be a wow killer
[4:38:17] 28jc: started in cs 1.5
[4:38:19] zSKIz1: new world open beta last august was better optimized than the alpha i have right now
[4:38:20] DelcoAF: it's the facebook of rpgs
[4:38:38] d3vde: found out that league of legends is apparently 15 years old this year that blew my mind @Towelliee
[4:38:50] J_Bran3: Rainbow Six Siege has been still pretty popular as of late for like 7 teards
[4:38:52] J_Bran3: years..
[4:38:54] Rapapep: I don't get why people care so much about if it's dying or not.
[4:38:56] DelcoAF: it's an addicting game
[4:38:58] magemaster225: all these games want to be games as a service, but then they all never do the service part
[4:38:59] manmower: dota came out in 2003
[4:38:59] zSKIz1: @Towelliee us in chat are not saying wow is dying or there is a new wow killer
[4:39:09] ncsu_riggs: why are there random gnomes in this instance?
[4:39:12] PadidinJones: @Towelliee but you dont feel that WoW is becoming a dead game right?
[4:39:27] Dorky1495: people dont want IRL in a game, they escape IRL in games
[4:39:30] stratiss: tbf Steven admitted in the QA it's not for everyone
[4:39:39] Megared25: I have been hearing wow dieing since cataclysm
[4:39:40] casa_dilla_: @towelliee what server are you on
[4:39:41] manmower: minesweeper still going strong as well
[4:39:56] masenka_: team based outdoor sandbox pvp mmo's are a nightmare to develop and make work. AoC has bitten off  a lot

[4:40:45] casa_dilla_: @towelliee what server are you on?
[4:40:51] zSKIz1: wow is not dying, it won't die for a long time
[4:40:54] fynnswow: @Tequilawyrm I don't recall ever hearing it in TBC/Wrath/maybe started around ICC/late cata is when I started hearing it.
[4:40:58] Flooaboo: The game was so much better in tbc
[4:41:05] J_Bran3: Thoughts on Rocket League popularity?

[4:41:20] railroad10989: if the bow or beast lord gear drops im be really sad lol
[4:41:22] Frank4LuLz: galaxies
[4:41:24] BadXo: wait, wasn't RIFT shut down ?
[4:41:25] slimoby: don't talk about wildstar:(((((
[4:41:26] AMDFusion: Classic era server @Towelliee Kappa
[4:41:26] da_moosse: rift not dead? impressive
[4:41:28] T0MMYT: pepeMeltdown
[4:41:28] Catspaw66: Everquest
[4:41:29] fynnswow: wildstar was the only game I found to be an actual wow killer. but then people complained about it being too hard
[4:41:32] magemaster225: star wars galaxy
[4:41:34] slimoby: wilstar still hurts so much
[4:41:37] Bayne77: wildstar and wow dead? Kappa
[4:41:38] geokouts: Man i loved City of Heroes
[4:41:39] slimoby: wildstar*
[4:41:40] aiden53015: classic era servers are dead af
[4:41:40] Megared25: Ffxi not dead
[4:41:44] Shinjuro: i still go back to SWTOR now and then
[4:41:48] ice_cream_dog: what abouy DYING games? @Towelliee
[4:41:49] ark_faber: FlyFF
[4:41:54] Masta_Gomes: it's the managed decline that is disappointing to watch. I know that companies need to make profit off their product but I feel now more than ever it's much more apparent and actively hurting the 'vision' and 'reputation' of the game and company. A part of me would be completely happy to see the game actually end on a high note and with a good standing. Probably a very non popular opinion lol
[4:42:02] Megared25: Still going after 19 years
[4:42:02] Zerofkgiven: wildstar was way ahead of its time
[4:42:04] T0MMYT: asheron's call Pepehand
[4:42:06] Tequilawyrm: @ThatUnfluffyPanda Starting off a counter point with "i feel" or "i dont remember" isn't a great first step to convincing me the WoW community have always been cringey doomsayers
[4:42:09] phyllixprime: they are busy planning 9.1 release kappa

[4:42:20] CaptainJoeyNY: Classic servers will get busy again, after BC progress ends

[4:42:27] dracullus: releasing fresh vanilla servers now would be so stupid
[4:42:28] fynnswow: @Tequilawyrm I can state it as fact like you did and be equally wrong.
[4:42:28] Clicklesly: "Yet" ^^
[4:42:32] CaptainJoeyNY: out of 25 PServers, only like 4 were BC servers
[4:42:32] slimoby: can we bring wildstar back?
[4:42:34] SteveSD: Boosts killed classic, they are just morons
[4:42:40] SteveSD: but they want money they dont give a f
[4:42:44] LawnSpeaker: They won’t announce that stuff so soon after bc
[4:42:45] TiredCarcass: just need some new stuff, been too long
[4:42:49] PadidinJones: @Tequilawyrm I wasnt saying that WoW was a dead game. I don't think it is at all. Ive been playing since Wolk when they said the same thing too. I wanted to hear my boy @Towelliee say it out loud
[4:42:57] LawnSpeaker: I think they’ll do wotlk first
[4:43:05] Genric_Tv: Bc feels better then classic for most classes
[4:43:10] LawnSpeaker: Then announce progression servers
[4:43:15] zodd_amhai: BC is just the best
[4:43:21] Tequilawyrm: @ThatUnfluffyPanda I just dont understand the rabid wow fandoms obsession with constantly praying their game will die or making comparison to other games like FF14
[4:43:23] fynnswow: on a scale of 1-10 how crappy would it be of blizzard if they hold off on 9.1 until FF14 expac?
[4:43:38] Dorky1495: 10
[4:43:42] Flooaboo: Hypothetically, what would you think of them continuing development of the game after lich king, but taking it in a different direction than they did for cata lol
[4:43:59] Genric_Tv: I could see them releasing it mid July
[4:44:00] Nehcrom: Let's hope both games can compete with each other to make them even better.
[4:44:12] slimoby: wildstar was by far my fav MMO, what happened to it wasn't fair
[4:44:29] Genric_Tv: I’m hoping we will hear somthing soon
[4:44:30] fynnswow: @Tequilawyrm I got a horde tattoo 11 years ago. The wow of today isn't the wow that started that passion. It's a shame.

[4:45:05] KonceptionZ: p2 tbc is late august
[4:45:15] porkkkkkkkkkk: phase 2 shouldn't launch until October
[4:45:16] mrpresbaby: what's your prediction date for  9.1 now?
[4:45:16] Ziephier: could launch with Sword of Legion
[4:45:18] dracullus: @Towelliee if end of season warning is this week, it will be June 29th
[4:45:20] Korupcija_: COPIUM
[4:45:23] giantbuckethead: @Towelliee are you going to play New World?
[4:45:31] LawnSpeaker: @flooaboo they should rerelease wotlk and cata with no lfg or lfr
[4:45:35] Tequilawyrm: @ThatUnfluffyPanda You weren't the same person you were 11 years ago. Sorry the game isn't filling the same void in your life it did back then

[4:46:07] Korupcija_: it's pet battle week during new world release :(
[4:46:08] Genric_Tv: But rumors are rumors
[4:46:13] fynnswow: @Tequilawyrm that's a lot of assumptions to make, compared to the fact the game has changed.
[4:46:20] Flooaboo: @LawnSpeaker I would tend to agree. I liked the lfg they had in late bc, where you just list your name for a dungeon/raid
[4:46:43] Tequilawyrm: @ThatUnfluffyPanda It's an assumption that peoples lives drastically change over 11 years? Kappa
[4:46:47] DramaticTv: thye did a massive tunign pass yesterday for M+

[4:48:28] LawnSpeaker: @flooaboo I hope that when they do progression servers they’ll put in the work to add new content and remove a lot of the things classic players don’t like from newer expansions like lfr
[4:48:37] Tequilawyrm: @diathi123 That's lost ark

[4:50:44] itscityboy: @Bombayshow like after WotLK, what do they do? cause everything after that is dog shit
[4:51:11] JubJubWantRubRubs: cant drink cause the furniture is angry OMEGALUL
[4:51:15] Flooaboo: @LawnSpeaker I think it's hopeful to think they would add any new content to the old games, but I could see them taking out things like LFR
[4:51:22] kw3nk: Breastplate is technically also prebis cause the 3x12 Stam sockets

[4:52:48] LawnSpeaker: @flooaboo I want them to go further than that... I don’t think they should look at progression servers as old content. Characters would eventually roll into the retail game, and they could sell a “progression pass”
[4:52:55] Genric_Tv: Speaking of that can u go over gear I belive that the wowhead prebis is kinda bs and I don’t wanna follow it
[4:53:01] CritcobainTV: fuuuuck mana tombs

[5:23:00] J_Bran3: ^Nice band name lol
[5:23:02] Oopogo1: @ElPolloBatman kinda weird right? coolest race can't play em
[5:23:09] Unciatim: a lot of them aren't getting the shot "for reasons" then going out to party.... kinda like the golfer Jon Rahm... lost out on 1.7mil because he didnt want to get the shot and went out.. etc etc etc
[5:23:09] Frank4LuLz: drinking and smoking

[5:24:51] Masqerader: Bucks could be dominating down low and Giannis out at the 3pt line clanging 3s on the rim
[5:24:55] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee did you see the big realms exploiting layers? Some groups killed kazzak like 4 times on diff layers and got loot every time
[5:25:13] bantuatha: If so, someone has to do big amount of camping
[5:26:18] CaptainJoeyNY: yup
[5:26:22] jeneraljelly: Theyre not gonna get banned
[5:26:29] J_Bran3: @Masqerader So true lol
[5:26:33] jeneraljelly: blizz doesnt gaf
[5:26:39] CaptainJoeyNY: Actually, you wont get banned for doing it in the world, but in dungeons you get banned

[5:27:23] Heksanar: I mean an addon ;P
[5:27:32] MagicHoof: endless reserves
[5:27:36] jeneraljelly: Thats an isntance not open world layering
[5:27:38] Vita_activa: How did you learn about the bans?
[5:27:48] Bayne77: TowelNarc Kappa
[5:28:06] bantuatha: @Towelliee Blizzard seems has spared your account since you know you don't want to fuck with the exploit bug

[5:28:24] CaptainJoeyNY: its different in a zone that in a dungeon
[5:28:25] jeneraljelly: Its their layering system so i dont see how they can ban people  for layer hopping open world
[5:28:31] bantuatha: And you did reported the bug right?
[5:28:37] jeneraljelly: @CaptainJoeyNY I think youre 100% right
[5:28:40] Bombayshow: They should ban Home IP people would shit themselves LUL
[5:29:42] Kinghorn: kazzak isnt endless though
[5:29:45] Dorky1495: its an exploit KEKW
[5:29:48] Kinghorn: only a finite number of layers
[5:29:56] CritcobainTV: @Kinghorn it is when there's like 15 layers lmao
[5:29:57] EthicalHermit: does it have a loot lockout?
[5:29:59] jeneraljelly: I guess well wait and see
[5:30:10] CaptainJoeyNY: You could organically find Kazzak without "switching" layers
[5:30:23] CritcobainTV: @CaptainJoeyNY yeah, ONCE
[5:30:46] CaptainJoeyNY: yeah thats a bit much
[5:30:49] Naturalbeef: Imagine not comprehending that it's an exploit regardless of where it's located
[5:30:50] jason_tacey: that's crazy
[5:30:57] Vita_activa: that is crazy tbh
[5:31:10] CaptainJoeyNY: @Naturalbeef imagine being a judgyboy
[5:31:10] dracullus: well they are morons, what else is there to say
[5:31:11] CostanzatheMage: LUL
[5:31:12] RageerPLZ: They really enjoy chess
[5:31:12] roeddogg: clever use of game mechanics though
[5:31:14] slimoby: accident
[5:31:34] GeekInParadise: "It's the devs fault for letting it slip through"
[5:31:34] Bayne77: cant log in, oh well, ff14 it is! Kappa
[5:32:08] jeneraljelly: We have been beta testing TBC the whole time
[5:32:12] CritcobainTV: I didnt' see any bugs, definitely saw some rats though
[5:32:16] Vita_activa: worst part is the people in that raid have no excuse: if you are raiding kara right now, someone in your raid has experience; they know they are only supposed to loot those bosses one.
[5:32:21] sprert: there are a lot of bugs everywhere in tbc
[5:32:25] GeekInParadise: Oh yeah, I had it in quotes to show that's what the abusers would try to use
[5:32:29] Vita_activa: or what other bosses in wow give more than one drop ...
[5:32:39] Vita_activa: no precedent to loot more than once
[5:32:44] CritcobainTV: I love this shit right now tbh
[5:32:50] jeneraljelly: its 100% rushed
[5:32:54] jeneraljelly: so many bugs and broken shit
[5:32:58] jeneraljelly: classic activision
[5:32:59] shortyforthewin: blizz have had so many years fixing that issue so i dunno what too say exatly
[5:33:03] JyroX: People who try to justify bug abuse are the same folks who think stuff at the store should be free if it doesn't scan properly. 4Head
[5:33:03] Longlastnamae: its not even a new bug
[5:33:22] ThaOriginalGamester: LUL
[5:33:34] hammack52: weather the devs let something slip through or not it is the gamers fault for abusing something that they know is not working as intened, and looting a raid boss of any kind multiple times is one of those things
[5:33:41] bantuatha: @Towelliee Like I said you are very lucky to be the first one discovering it
[5:34:01] warrenny: Isnt that normal for beta?
[5:34:02] parzhc: yea some how chess event chest is tied to shade of aran trash mob respawns
[5:34:11] CritcobainTV: 2nd boss is a joke
[5:34:16] CritcobainTV: random dmg onto a player
[5:34:16] xXSiebzehnXx: GRIZZLY HILLS towHAMUP
[5:34:22] CritcobainTV: and a stun
[5:34:22] have_an_egg: Consortium Revered boss quest chain; unlocks Yoj - epic rings and random rolled blues
[5:34:24] Kinghorn: ranged stay maxed range shouldnt be bad
[5:34:25] bantuatha: @Towelliee You had Karazhan's gear you should able to be prepare now
[5:34:46] lonelybloody2: range need to be max range to need get it by EQ
[5:34:49] jason_tacey: face boss away iirc
[5:34:53] Oopogo1: revered for 1 use key...exalted for permanent key
[5:34:57] have_an_egg: AH, Yor, yeah, I was close :P
[5:35:08] lonelybloody2: to not get it *
[5:35:27] JyroX: Also, if you have the patience to sit through Chess 30-40 times, you have the patience to go kill Wild Boars in Elwynn Forest to go from level 1-70. Accept your ban and just reroll. 4Head
[5:37:19] TheItalianStallion321: the impulse is called.....retail

[5:40:46] Shinjuro: i just hit 53 today ive ben relentlessly grinding my way from level 1 since i dont really wanna pay for boost xD
[5:40:54] da_moosse: pay for me to boost on a new account and il be a prot warrior until the end of classic times

[5:41:24] Nevindaz: WICKED
[5:41:52] TheGaoSora: Mage goes brrrrrrrrrr
[5:42:01] JyroX: Have boosts been a good thing for Classic? I'd like to think they have been. Original classic TBC had trouble getting new players into end-game because the only level-boosting that existed violated the TOS.
[5:42:52] zechetto: I have at least 3 friends that would not have been playing whitout boost
[5:43:28] KnsWoW: i wouldnt
[5:43:29] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:43:44] Archiee: I'm poor, so I'm leveling that shit :( feelsbadman
[5:43:46] ArcaneSyntax: also after like 65 it's impossible to tell if someone boosted or not.
[5:43:52] Oopogo1: towellie's just bill dipperly
[5:44:06] JyroX: There are plenty of adults working full-time with kids who don't have time for the grind to get to end-game and just want to log on and do dungeons and raids with their friends. Nothing wrong with using boost to get to do that imo.
[5:44:34] osatox: boosts are great for ppl who value their time. Rather than spend days leveling a fresh toon, just a portion of a work day to get to the boosted level is worthwhile
[5:44:38] Masqerader: i got to level 10 and was like I am good, and spent 600k retail gold to buy the boost with bnet balance
[5:45:21] ForgottnHero21: If they allowed more than one boost per account, they would make even more bank
[5:45:24] CaptainJoeyNY: I just wish I could boost my pally. I have leveled enough toons through vanilla content in classic
[5:45:34] katsou07: i would boost every class if we had the chance so much time saved
[5:45:40] pronkk_: i boosted hunter and am sad now, want shaman
[5:45:47] JyroX: Blizzard puts that stuff in the game to try to cut down on scammers and third-party websites making money off their product. They know people will pay for it, so they might as well sell it.
[5:46:01] Dorky1495: can they let me boost my shammy on ally k thanks blizz
[5:46:06] chrslp: Oh 100% they will. Thatd be throwing $ away otherwise
[5:46:09] Masqerader: I forgot about spell pushback, i regret making a caster lol

[5:48:10] JyroX: Cross-realm LFG even in Classic would be pretty nice, but I'm not a game design expert
[5:48:20] raldrik: do you think tbc will die when 9.1 goes live or will it just pause until people get through 9.1 content
[5:48:24] ArcaneSyntax: but when they do the barber shop just make it the retail one.

[5:49:22] KombatWombat07: there's so much to do in tbc people won't get bored of it any time soon
[5:49:53] dracullus: end of August is too soon for 9.1.5, so it must be TBC phase
[5:49:53] MikedUpGaming: Really wish this NDA was over

[5:51:12] Bombayshow: I have the same problem in shadowland LUL
[5:51:13] wadethewaters: ive played every single day 18 hours a day since TBC launch and i still have shit to do
[5:51:19] MikedUpGaming: I'm at about 300+ hours in the Alpha
[5:51:31] BlueBeast33: And this phase doesn't even have Tier 5
[5:51:34] chrslp: I got like halfway into honored pretty much on all of the outland reps by the time i hit 70
[5:51:36] apopthis: I'm going nuts.  I've been looking for a group for SFK on my tbc server for two days to do my pali quest
[5:51:41] MikedUpGaming: Yeah
[5:51:42] pk99: I'm not even 70 yet LUL
[5:51:57] MikedUpGaming: Alpha pop isn't that big yet
[5:52:17] JyroX: During the old days of Classic, people didn't really know the game, have ironed-out strats, crazy add-on's, etc etc etc so it seemed a lot more complicated/difficult than it actually was.
[5:52:42] JyroX: With re-release and only "really" hardcore WoW players playing it, it seems a lot easier I'm betting.
[5:53:04] Hexof: ye I remember the kara attune being way harder than it actually is. LUL
[5:53:10] MikedUpGaming: I think they will have 6 at launch
[5:53:18] MikedUpGaming: With 9 planned I think
[5:53:18] apopthis: I think 5 or 6 @Towelliee
