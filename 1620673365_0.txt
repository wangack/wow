[3:49:02] Euneekz: 15 resil = 4 defense rating
[3:49:07] GreekGoatt: If WoW adds more skillshot skills instead of simple target and more depth to class fantasy i.e. more specs, it would be awesome

[4:15:59] streetpan: you should be tanking the boss where you are now sitting to eat...
[4:16:01] VoylRL: 2 drakes is just much easier on 25m 10m is kind ameh
[4:16:06] weelomeelo: @getitbiggie if u release before everyone is dead u get the lust debuff, the addon is to remember people
[4:16:11] Dakooria: Is there a reason why they aren't tanking Sarth away from the drakes?

[4:17:46] weelomeelo: @cydol looks like bartender
[4:17:46] Abnecide: 25m is easier because few people can get carried
[4:17:54] neroforte77: howmany healer?
[4:17:57] streetpan: you should tank him where you are now
[4:18:00] BillboyJAM: I got 5 on it
[4:18:00] iTWONi: 5 on it!
[4:18:01] weelomeelo: @abnecide yep, depends on the team
[4:18:10] streetpan: idk why you would tank him is such a weird spot
[4:18:14] Dakooria: @abnecide I've done 2 drake with 3 tanks; it's not really a dps check fight, it's a stay alive
[4:18:19] kaizenherr: that dragon can be a new modCheck emote
[4:18:22] Death_Dono: 4Head just dodge the fire wall
[4:18:24] VoylRL: @weelomeelo we beat 25m with half the raid dead during most of the fight KEKW
[4:18:37] weelomeelo: tanking where he is is better to pull mobs but it is a lot worse since there's no time to evade the wave
[4:18:40] neroforte77: 2 or 3 heals?
[4:18:46] weelomeelo: @weelomeelo yep ahhahaha
[4:19:10] Hugo_BAWS: 10man in cata was dope
[4:19:42] itsanthony07: ;
[4:19:44] weelomeelo: I prefer 10m because I usually raid with a perfect 10 man team
[4:20:02] weelomeelo: it was hard back then to find 25 good people, or at least 20
[4:20:16] streetpan: why he never use wings btw xD
[4:20:20] itzBlaZn: Does anyone know why Shroud changed DPI against his own advice? 50 DPI is
[4:20:32] weelomeelo: @streetpan it mess the threat
[4:20:37] lwisecarver: @BlaZnBoyZ cuz shroud is GIGACHAD
[4:20:38] phelixdacat00: you tank the big boss in the far right corner
[4:20:47] Supmeow: is this 3 drake?

[4:21:53] weelomeelo: @phelixdacat00 they fixed it on classic, didn't they?
[4:22:02] phelixdacat00: nope.
[4:22:06] coolwhipsing: just dont attack vesp, at this point sarth has 1.8 mil
[4:22:15] johndead75: Sounds like to me you need to sell OTK
[4:22:19] triplezro: 15min away
[4:22:20] Regalya: Boss has 65% Extra Hp now it's unzergable so has to do the correct way
[4:22:26] weelomeelo: thats dope, it's way easier to tank on the right far corner then

[4:22:57] cobravomero: why the heck u talk while eating, disgusting
[4:22:59] zay__x: i did 25m 3d back when it was on retail and we tanked it seperately
[4:23:02] blackdragon620: Leeroy Jenkins?
[4:23:04] Monoxcidee: I did 3 drake lastnight we tanked sap that corner but we tanked the drakes next to him when they came down to keep it easy on heals/dps
[4:23:06] triplezro: hey
[4:23:06] weelomeelo: repair??
[4:23:11] chEEsEypOOfs85: if nobody is taking tail whip dmg, you think fire resist aura would be better? cuz of the adds
[4:23:13] Dakooria: No, it does works in the closer corner; I've run this on 10/25, the corner they eat at was the easiest for me tanking him. you can dodge both fire walls without even moving the Sarth if you pre-position him right
[4:23:14] Omegamonkaw: talking with ur mouth full sounds like u got a dik in it

[4:33:49] ChubbyMikey: @walid342 no, this is world of warcraft.
[4:33:50] dragoniitezz: But for the positioning you would need to kick out right and then move left to the corner to have the dragon sideways
[4:34:02] cooberss: my main tank <3
[4:34:02] hagspretten: @shroud You pull the boss to the right on pull, then drag him to the corner you tanked him in. That way the tail wont be towards the raid and melee dps can shuffle side to side to dodge fire wall
[4:34:07] jotaaVII: chat this is Naxx?
[4:34:11] dubblejae: @Voyl_ well he never specified so

[4:38:19] bohan_: its reflect damage... when 2nd drake comes out you get twilight torment debuff
[4:38:23] Death_Dono: i think they are dying from meteors
[4:38:23] VoylRL: yeah
[4:38:25] Xytelol: You guys have no dmg
[4:38:26] simply_sain: true
[4:38:29] VoylRL: damage is very low
[4:38:39] Xytelol: How are people doing < 3k dps
[4:38:46] Zlutus: combat rogue and frost dk, ofc its lacking
[4:38:48] ba_dzik: 2 guys died by wave
[4:38:54] blazemarley: you know theres a little cheese spot/spot to tank on the right corner where it makes it easy mode for you @shroud

[4:39:11] silentstormpt: most anyway
[4:39:16] FrozyTV: I think dmg is low because people are focusing on their positioning and not die, when they get used to it, dmg will get better I feel like
[4:39:19] „Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Éç„Éº„É†„ÇØ„Ç¢: Kreygasm

[4:39:23] lajmenno: If the whelps are a problem just have dps enter the portal with a healer
[4:39:27] Pigsgideonwar: Tank adds on the dragon
[4:39:27] simply_sain: 5k+ dps is pretty standard
[4:39:44] Abnecide: yea 5k is pretty normal at this point if you know your rotation and stats and spec etc
[4:39:45] mtg0beast: are they PRe raid BIS?
[4:39:47] Jonsbe: taunt the dragon between the boss and raid
[4:40:02] Fugeki: @mtg0beast doubt

[4:40:14] chriswhoppers: I've never played this games, is it free to play?
