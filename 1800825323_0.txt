[0:39:16] Weemancod: i dont think they should start messing with stuff like that
[0:39:19] Cowardpatty: I mean, playing devil's advocate, how is that different than Vanish?
[0:39:45] Dibles714: bubble hearth is cheating
[0:39:50] VanishmentThisWorld: cus enemies can still see through your vanish
[0:40:02] itsHanoo: Agree, in that case ice block, vanish, etc shouldn't be removed
[0:40:05] ttvturdle: ayyyyoooo hows it goin man \
[0:40:05] Bare02: i think the other stuff can fail where bubble hearth cant
[0:40:10] Reapshc: I think someone has personal vendetta vs paladins or something lol. Same thing as hunters having pets , locks etc. each classes have their perks.

[0:40:11] algalontheobserver: Should be allowed to group, no AH or mailbox. Only appeals allowed are D/C or such deaths.
[0:40:17] bruktserviett: just have the death=delete and let hc be a group activity
[0:40:28] darkpatron90: bubble hearth is a disqualify for hc
[0:40:28] VanishmentThisWorld: i dont think they can get it til lvl50 or something anyways right?
[0:40:32] Weemancod: @Reapshc this exactly
[0:40:33] BOMGAR: vanish can resist, bubble hearth is 100% safe
[0:40:40] DevineSpIkE: bubble hearth is a 100% save
[0:40:45] DevineSpIkE: same as a soul stone
[0:40:58] Dibles714: A pally would literally never die

[0:41:09] bruktserviett: disable bub hearth in grp content
[0:41:10] Cowardpatty: It's on an hour CD right?  And you are inconvenienced by wasting a hearth.  I dunno, I don't see the problem with it
[0:41:39] Riddle010: i mean AH doesnt exist anyway so why farm gold?
[0:41:51] xAce101x: idk if they should ban it. people make or dont make a paladin knowing they can bubble hearth.
[0:42:18] bbarrell: No AH is a huge reason why HC is so much more fun
[0:42:24] drmabusee: i think bot programmer can adjust
[0:42:28] Riddle010: honestly i think taht would ruin it
[0:42:29] divineholy1: When’s last time u been to Disney world swiftytoday?
[0:42:37] VanishmentThisWorld: they can fix boosts by only allowing grouping within 5 lvls of each other
[0:42:49] chimerablaque: bubble hearth doesnt even work til 45 or something
[0:42:55] trashcanman3: Be too easy to have a main funnel money to your hardcore on a regular server
[0:44:27] chimerablaque: bubble length not long enuf til later in game

[1:57:12] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: What is in hardcore mode if you're a hunter and your pet dies, that's it. It's dead. Got to go tame another one
[1:57:18] icefloe_: NN

[1:57:55] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: I'm talking about a pet for a hunter. What if it can permit as well
[1:57:55] Cowardpatty: If hunter pet dies, hunter has to stop playing, since they are a duo  ;-)
[1:58:20] divineholy1: Is the tru coward
[1:58:24] BoldH3art: so if u are full lvl and die its gone? all worke u do is for nothig?
[1:58:28] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: Or they just have to go tame another one and release the one that died since you know technically dead
[1:58:38] LegendarySamuraiZenKai: That would make it more risky to go team another one. You would have the chance of dying without a pet until you could tame another one

[3:21:10] zall96: They don't want to go to the office, even if its half the time required. Employees are a bit spoiled
[3:21:19] xichell: if retail dies I'll continue paying the sub just to play classic

[6:04:13] kingbigdookie: you dont like cheaters, but you are cheating in hardcore by leveling duos but not duos
[6:04:41] Cerealy: they have it on their phones or another monitor and know the best moves before they are played

[6:20:41] DewyGG: @Zer0_Nation no
[6:20:47] Locrinus: Teaming!
[6:20:59] cetkaoh: is she streaming still?
[6:21:08] Locrinus: It’s called teaming and in Fortnite, it’s against the rules
[6:21:19] ZweiTTV: doesnt that kinda mean its against the spirit of the rules lol
[6:21:32] Yaboybaldwin: Is this allowed?
[6:21:36] Locrinus: Well…
[6:21:37] LowYaBusa: I think teaming up is like asking for help. Invalid run
[6:21:47] MrBoomToasted: their not teaming lol, their just doing the same quests
[6:22:04] ZweiTTV: happen to be doing the same thing huh :\
[6:22:18] DrunkenHorror: @moneyisthemotive2 yes teaming like this is against the rules if youre not a duo
[6:22:24] Locrinus: That’s what ppl said who got caught on Fortnite, but we’re banned anyways
[6:22:46] formidable_dave: formidable_dave subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[6:22:47] StreamElements: formidable_dave just subscribed for 32 months in a row PogChamp
[6:22:54] Panzertree: I don't see how it would be against the rules as your allowed to run dungeons in groups
[6:22:59] Locrinus: See, they are helping each other
[6:23:03] Locrinus: Teaming
[6:23:09] Justissier: Coastal Runners
[6:23:11] Aldever13: @Swifty did you get human heritage armor yet?
[6:23:44] Panzertree: grouping/teaming is a core mechanic of an MMORPG
[6:23:52] TrillOGtv: SUNDER
[6:24:06] leaf421: sunder armor more dmg yeah?
[6:24:10] TrillOGtv: get 5 stacks of sunder then HS
[6:24:21] DrunkenHorror: @Panzertree because it sais you cant ask for help or team in any way unless you select duo/trio at the start then the rules change,  and there are specific rules for dungeon grouping,  one of which is no grinding/questing
[6:24:21] Locrinus: They are playing hardcore mode you twit
[6:24:30] RoloDB: sunder is more damage, bec you are also spamming for OP procs
[6:24:38] Venom77: What mace?
[6:24:41] RoloDB: HS eats an AA and that also lessens rage regen
[6:24:46] CygnusC: heroic strike costs way more rage
[6:25:09] DrunkenHorror: @Panzertree the game mode they are playuing forbids it except under specific circumstances

[6:26:38] DrunkenHorror: @Swifty arnt you worried grouping like this will invalidate the run?
[6:26:46] Panzertree: well as they are not actually in a group I think it could be called a grey area
[6:27:16] ZweiTTV: it against the rules though, only team up if youre in a duo
[6:27:22] ZweiTTV: youre intentionally helping eachother
[6:27:27] DewyGG: they aren't teaming every enemy... they wouldn't get xp or complete quests
[6:27:36] MrBoomToasted: NotLikeThis
[6:27:39] CygnusC: you're allowed to help other people
[6:27:42] Zetherior: xp and loot arnt shared chat LUL
[6:27:49] SendNewsWunk: what is the best server for hardcore?
[6:27:53] coopsboyy_: New house swify??
[6:27:54] ZweiTTV: they are purposely splitting over condensed mobs
[6:27:57] wonderwaffle407: HC police LUL
[6:27:58] Locrinus: When you are telling each other to watch your backs, or to come this way, or coordinate, I think that constitutes teaming, ergo grouping.
[6:28:01] coopsboyy_: I haventr watched in about 5 years
[6:28:09] Zetherior: @Zer0_Nation that happens naturally
[6:28:12] spankymcpie: @Zer0_Nation cry about it
[6:28:14] Tomoglaziat: bloodsail buch
[6:28:22] cosmichushpuppy: Officer this character right here!
[6:28:23] Glenwoodgames: ya call the hc police lool

[6:28:42] HorribleHarry71: lets turn them in chat
[6:28:44] MrBoomToasted: They aren't doing anything wrong, so let it go people
[6:28:53] TrillOGtv: chill they are 20
[6:28:55] Glenwoodgames: right
[6:28:55] CygnusC: you're not allowed to have fun, I HATE THIS
[6:28:58] i_cook_up: Your not allowed to ask for help
[6:29:01] Zetherior: @Locrinus that happens naturally ingame also.. its an rp server too, so it happens a lot
[6:29:18] sharpenk: whos rules you all talking about? blizz or the guild?
[6:29:26] xichell: you are not allowed to ask for buffs help hmmm
[6:29:32] Glenwoodgames: like sh ut up
[6:29:43] i_cook_up: Then your run is therefore valid end of discussion
[6:29:44] TheFungineer2: swiftyNohealer
[6:29:44] BoricuaSJ: WoW itself was never designed for  just solo leveling anyways.
[6:29:48] Locrinus: Def teaming tho.  Coordinating and making call outs. Graven warning Swifty about patting elites instead of him not noticing organically.
[6:30:01] Zetherior: you're still allowed to give help and buffs, just not to ask for them
[6:30:07] Locrinus: Teagen*
[6:30:07] ConkersBadCodeDay: You're an awesome person dude I just dropped by to say God bless you man. Take care.
[6:30:13] HorribleHarry71: no more teaming no more teaming no more teaming chant it with me chat

[6:31:17] VanishmentThisWorld: they gotta have something to complain about LuL
[6:31:22] DrunkenHorror: @xichell you cant ever ask for help with anything,  no rules against helping others but if they ask and you help and someone is recording it could get both runs invalidated

[6:36:09] dopieGG: Some people just enjoy chaos, unfortunately.
[6:36:10] SnuxyGG: died on 24 warrior, sad day, gonna keep the journey going non-HC
[6:36:16] Panzertree: I think the big issue here is HC is not supposed to be fun per some people, so they have to complain about you having fun
[6:36:29] DrunkenHorror: @Swifty 100% agree,  but they have been know to use streamer Vods to enforce rules/ used to validate.  i was mostly talking about when you were planning out how to take a camp/ coordinating they could argue/say thats teaming/asking for help
[6:37:02] SetDog1: i thought accepting continued help may violate rule
[6:37:09] i_cook_up: Yeah and if they invalidate your run that’s days of time played gone
[6:37:18] DrunkenHorror: doubt they would care but was just curious if you cared at all if that could lead to an invalidation

[6:38:05] DinkytheDoodle: I just think that what people have issue with it you are going against the spirit of HC. Alone..on your own...grinding it out. You keep saying "it's not against the rules" while it may not be...it seems against the spirit of HC. They feel you are stretching the rules to allow what your doing and not offically teaming up

[7:14:55] ceodwarf420: he should contact with them, or maybe we dont know, he already talked to them and is just not saying anything to us
[7:15:13] alexa_brie: so should everyone stream their 0-max so a mod can make sure no one assisted them the whole time? streamers if anything get more critique than anyone else

[10:19:35] Herzenliegen: Tries*
[10:19:51] DewyGG: yeah the 1 dungeon run sucks a bit since I love dungeons but makes sense they want more people questing to level and not grind dungeon 24/7

[10:20:40] Nev0: @multiversu8 in the addon there is a tab "dungeons" that shows what you have ran and the ID of your save. If there are 2 different IDs for one dungeon your challenge is failed
[10:20:41] HighWarlordofCHAZ: Name of the monitor ?
[10:20:43] Zeracho: Can you not raise it so you're not looking down at the center of the screen? Seems like that would strain your neck after awhile
