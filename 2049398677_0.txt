[0:25:43] Heisenberg: @StaysafeTV did u see the dungeon caster loot got buffed?
[0:25:49] holy_molar: @StaysafeTV Do you think the mage boosting meta, as its known right now, is dead with the changes to Regen/Mass Regen?
[0:25:50] NutterCircus: 7g is enough
[0:25:51] sengip: hit DMF for the buffs too @StaysafeTV
[0:25:57] jimbonni: 1.20 GOLD
[0:25:57] wookinit: i think they are like 2g
[0:26:20] kirurgen95: spellfire no longer heals
[0:26:26] kirurgen95: or well reduced healing
[0:26:26] holy_molar: Its the Class duning one
[0:26:53] mazian4: I mean mages are just gonna be using blizzard again so its fine
[0:26:56] kaiju_kin: its crazy they made it so much better
[0:27:03] eliwood63: mages will still be able to do the zf gy boost. not gonna change much imo
[0:27:12] Mawshaw: As a mage I agree. They needed to make it so living flame doesn't heal and it seems like that's what they did
[0:27:23] iknowido: quest in ashenvale
[0:27:26] Qworalmarker: the OH from the BFD raid quest is good
[0:27:26] mazian4: buy arcane one

[0:27:32] kamuriz: bfd quest
[0:27:33] iknowido: let me get the name
[0:27:37] Kallego7: arcane wrath
[0:27:38] Moo360: mages are such a hero class in vanilla they could literally have just not added any runes to them and they'd still be good
[0:27:40] 903gaming: +7 arcane
[0:27:44] sound_wayv: the damp note quest
[0:27:46] iknowido: yup
[0:27:49] Qworalmarker: that one
[0:27:51] NutterCircus: KEKL
[0:27:54] TheBootyBoyTV: Chat there's something about raid night I just love while playing on my ret paladin.  My phone is blown up by hot, beautiful women who want to date me while I just try to focus on dealing incredible damage.

[0:27:57] ShingaTV: buy nature or arcane dmg one?
[0:27:58] iknowido: no sp but nice stats
[0:28:01] TrooperHuge: hey!
[0:28:24] iknowido: get 1 more int ans d stam with quest shoulders
[0:28:35] TrooperHuge: you feeling better?
[0:28:47] sengip: Can't mages just AOE farm the same way they used to in Classic if they did nerf regen? Like the AOE ice bs in ZF
[0:29:12] ATcaribou: i have so much i want to get done in 8 days. im not even sure what i should prioritize. i guess rep and professions. prequest can wait as im not sure i can make it to first lockout anyways
[0:29:25] mazian4: Thats boring though why limit what people can do
[0:29:27] iknowido: funny because mages are actually better than ever at aoe farming
[0:29:43] iknowido: actually tank the whole dungeon
[0:29:55] sengip: @iknowido  not if spellfire doesnt heal lol
[0:30:00] emergencybig: did u think gdkp ban was good?
[0:30:01] iknowido: yes
[0:30:05] g0dzilla: i think mages dont hurt anybody by boosting others...

[0:30:11] g0dzilla: is that just me?

[0:31:48] g0dzilla: @iknowido source?
[0:31:52] ATcaribou: @StaysafeTV design question, would you prefer each class be locked to their main armor type. warriors cant roll on leather, boomie cant roll on cloth, paladan cant roll on cloth, etc?
[0:31:56] StoneyYeti: isnt it like less than 8 dyas
[0:31:57] iknowido: chat

[0:33:38] TheBootyBoyTV: TBH 98% of my time has been on one character and I am in no way bored when you think about rune gathering, rep grinds like WSG, etc
[0:33:48] TheBootyBoyTV: plus just traditional farming
[0:33:50] maverrick15: im sorta bored in sod cause im only grinding on 1 but got multiple alts that are just casual
[0:33:51] Frayeen: I got 6 full bis chars rdy for p2
[0:33:51] sliizew: playing 1 character also makes you boring Pepega
[0:34:08] ATcaribou: the only people bored are people who thing "ive cleared the raid already, what else is there?"
[0:34:31] linkitcraig: 250 damage dot...jfc
[0:34:36] g0dzilla: @TheBootyBoyTV WSG is the most boring pvp thing i have ever played in 10 years of gaming now
[0:34:36] tally_squid: where osrs
[0:34:44] TheBootyBoyTV: @g0dzilla no disagreement with you
[0:34:51] RockyMountainOyster: I imagine a whole raid of Engi's will be able to cheese fights?

[0:36:39] Ruinx81: Depends how many other groups there are farming that spot
[0:36:41] spike82q: DMF should be a non  pvp zone for those gamer dads, so they dont have to waste 2 hours trying form a raid to get the buff

[0:36:56] only499atkfc: does anyone know if completing all the quests and having them ready for turn in gonna be worth it ?

[0:38:36] OGTigolebitties: what level do u guys think the BFD gear will fall off?

[0:48:45] HighWarlordofCHAZ: Has Streamer Prio been bad for the game?
[0:48:50] ATcaribou: @Lmgd1 you killed graysfordays, but we still love you
[0:48:55] abdarahyin: Asmon's perspective is it punishes non-gold buyers... but Zack fails to understand that you don't need to buy gold in world where only 10% of the raid buys gold for the GDKP LMAO LUL LUL LUL
[0:48:57] flugrman: anyone else overwhelmed but pumped by p2?
[0:48:58] numblezzz: typical russian hating on the beauty of capitalism
[0:49:11] jimbonni: I think staysafe never hyad streamer prio bro
[0:49:11] wookinit: i pugged and didnt even know 1 mechanic we had no issues lol
[0:49:14] Deomas11: Gear should be earned through IN-GAME effort and/or skill. Real life activites should never impact that. It's simple.
[0:49:15] seimmavi: Blizzard are saying that they have "multiple detection methods for GDKP that are effective both inside and outside of dungeon or raid instances" and at the same time they are not doing anything with army of bots running around ICANT
[0:49:15] Swooshi_XD: the game is easy
[0:49:17] g0dzilla: @HighWarlordofCHAZ What Streamerprio?
[0:49:18] chipm_: how does a bfd go bad?
[0:49:18] AFKJG: streamers saying gdkp's are bad but people like asmon just open trade with random fans and get unlimited gold LUL not all of us have streamer privs
[0:49:21] boxhead66: I have not had a failed run yet
[0:49:25] maverrick15: people say that gdkps are better cause the people are better but if those people did ms>os runs theyd also be just as good
[0:49:28] jimbonni: HE always pugs so
[0:49:29] thepinga: people exaggerate how bad the classic crowd it. its some weird retail brain
[0:49:29] jimbonni: :D
[0:49:31] ATcaribou: pugging has been pretty excellent. missed the first 4 lockouts for being slow, pugged every one on 2 characters since with one 1 failed run
[0:49:37] dave3ooo: what
[0:49:38] HighWarlordofCHAZ: Good healers and tanks could make a lot of gold doing GDKPs.
[0:49:40] Utmost777: only viewer raids fail seqKEK
[0:49:46] Riv_VK: yea pugging has gone well for me too done around 30 on 5 alts and only 1 went bad
[0:49:50] HrdScp: I swear bad players dont even join gdkps
[0:49:59] dave3ooo: @HighWarlordofCHAZ anyone can make a lot of gold in gdkps
[0:50:00] HighWarlordofCHAZ: @g0dzilla Streamers get the loot.
[0:50:04] windatar: As someone that never did GDKP or really cared about them. I just think the whole shitstorm of banning GDKP is hilarious. Literally everything is on fire depending on where you look.
[0:50:10] numblezzz: ive heard gdkps generally go way better than random pugs
[0:50:17] Deomas11: Gear should be earned, not bought - wether for gold or dollars. It's simple.
[0:50:18] wookinit: yep
[0:50:19] Maxifrog: @HrdScp naw i've had some retarded carries
[0:50:21] wookinit: W

[0:50:44] dave3ooo: a buyer isn't a carry
[0:50:54] dave3ooo: so funny how people mistake the two
[0:50:55] abdarahyin: @seimmavi Blizzard can't stop bots lol. Ask the botters themselves. It's not hard to find a "tough guy" who's badass at WoW and knows a guy... so they're stopping the incentive to bot in the first place... Blizzard W. DinoDance
[0:51:02] g0dzilla: @highwarlordofchaz, dont see a issue there... if the community wants to support the streamer like that, its not against the rules or stuff...
[0:51:04] Metaphix: turned me from wrath for sure
[0:51:09] mazian4: You think they are testing the waters for cataclysm? @StaysafeTV
[0:51:11] windatar: Ybarra gets fired and GDKP gets canned, little sus at the timing NGL.
[0:51:15] give_me_a_1_in_chat: nah id say they only really got bad in wrath. classic and tbc they werent that bad
[0:51:20] linkitcraig: it used to be that you couldn't pay to win raid gear, but now you can
[0:51:29] Deomas11: The largest reason bots are rampant is gold-buyers for GDKPs. Cutting the demand might be more effective then attacking the supply.
[0:51:29] dirbagdan: Here's a wild take... you can do pug runs and just roll on loot... :O
[0:51:31] Geedub13: Ybarra loved GDKPS lol
[0:51:36] bakerbaker019: no only if you dont like them
[0:51:40] BonustrackTV: there still gunna be GDKPs who are we kidding?

[0:51:48] dave3ooo: @Deomas11 incorrect, bots would exist with or without gdkps
[0:51:54] wookinit: yea it was stupid
[0:51:54] crumbler81: without gdkp, I might actually get to raid Naxx this time around...back in classic I just couldn't afford consumes for it.
[0:51:54] seimmavi: @seimmavi Double digit iq take, please never speak on this subject ever again, ty
[0:51:56] g0dzilla: @windatar Ybarra left Blizz... he didnt get fired... read his twitter posts
[0:51:57] numblezzz: while we are at it, also give bigger punishment to buyers. pathetic they didnt even suspend soda, just took his gold
[0:51:57] abdarahyin: A large portion of Gold Seller's profits are at stake because a good portion of gold buyer GDKPer's are quitting/stopping
[0:51:59] aBradAbroad: @StaysafeTV read that malding link please
[0:52:08] ATcaribou: gdkp in era right now is ridiculous. 50k g per item is noirmal
[0:52:09] Ruinx81: ERA is riddled with GDKP and economy is ruined
[0:52:09] wookinit: around ZG
[0:52:11] AFKJG: please correct me if im wrong, but how much of your gold is earned vs given by fans? I know asmon just gets handed mounds of gold.
[0:52:19] Deomas11: Bots will exist, but activity will go down signifantly if people aren't buying for GDKPs anymore.
[0:52:22] windatar: @g0dzilla I did, and it stinks of. "Microsoft gave me the option to leave on my own term."
[0:52:24] bottlekiddz: im so sad locks didnt get Seed. I wanted to warlock boost

[0:53:06] dirbagdan: @Deomas11 GDKP is literally THE ONLY reason for gold buying other than maybe BOE's. This will definitely hurt gold selling

[0:54:02] spansonite1: MrDestructoid
[0:54:03] dirbagdan: Games should be games. I love you @StaysafeTV but part of me even thinks streaming has ruined gaming
[0:54:09] boopbopbamski: guy probably had 10+ lvl 25s running GDKPs everyday selling gold
[0:54:11] windatar: GDKP is banned "I wont play anymore." Reeks of someone that sold gold. Because the game is the same, the game didn't change so why quit? unless it no longer made him money
[0:54:17] thenothing93: they updated all caster items from 5 man dungeons, just posted on wowhead
[0:54:19] linkitcraig: make some?
[0:54:25] abdarahyin: @windatar and bought gold*
[0:54:27] Valencia_Pete: lol you got cloth tho
[0:54:29] Snaketrap: YEP
[0:54:31] AFKJG: GDKP is a viable way to earn gold if you don't need gear.
[0:54:32] numblezzz: fucking streamers Madge
[0:54:35] Nyk_Wyld: HeyGuys sstvLOVE
[0:54:38] bottlekiddz: can you just make a GDKP guild and get around the new rule?
[0:54:47] Dreako00: How have Streamers ruined games?
[0:54:55] Mawshaw: @AFKJG viable =/= ethical
[0:54:56] abdarahyin: @AFKJG Which is fueled by the minority in that raid that buy 3rd party gold... that's the point.
[0:54:57] numblezzz: @AFKJG youre earning botted gold that people bought btw
[0:54:59] aBradAbroad: nO yOu CaN't ThEy wiLl StiLl hAppEn iN diScoRd
[0:55:00] numblezzz: indirect cheating
[0:55:01] spansonite1: <3 VoHiYo streamers
[0:55:04] cockjab: @bottlekiddz they said they are implementing a way to detect gdkps ingame
[0:55:05] NutterCircus: You dont have to play on streaming servers.
[0:55:14] windatar: @abdarahyin I doubt he bought gold, buying gold is banned. But some RMT sites allowed players to sell gold back. With GDKP's banned thats gone which is why people are quitting. It no longer makes them money.
[0:55:19] g0dzilla: @bottlekiddz we will see i guess... but i doubt it will be easy... seems like they are going hard on that topic
[0:55:27] linkitcraig: @AFKJG Clueless
[0:55:32] Swooshi_XD: @NutterCircus theres a streamer on every server though
[0:55:41] wookinit: yea had a buddy in classic pay their bills from selling gold to lazy guildies jsut from their gdkp runs was degen to the next lvl
[0:55:48] retau_: cant NIT do that?
[0:55:49] abdarahyin: @windatar "Gold is banned... he didn't buy gold..." Kappa LMAO
[0:55:51] linkitcraig: ill track it
[0:55:51] dirbagdan: YEP POOGERS
[0:55:52] AFKJG: ban the bots over the type of run then? banning a type of run is a bunch of empty promises, they will find ways around the "ban"
[0:55:52] QuestFor420: for a price
[0:55:53] numblezzz: NOPERS
[0:55:53] bakerbaker019: wheres staysafe been?>
[0:55:57] intefer: i will count them dont worry :)
[0:55:57] Grock: No :)
[0:56:01] Snaketrap: NA i'll track it
[0:56:02] Piorum_: doesn't NIT track that?
[0:56:03] DankWizard420: I cant count
[0:56:03] jimbonni: guys will my boots go out [Extraplanar Spidersilk Boots]if i drop tailer?
[0:56:07] Deomas11: Minority of players buy gold, but majority of GDKPs particpants do so they can get the gold from the guy that bought it. Everyone wants a gold buyer in their GDKP group.
[0:56:15] linkitcraig: NIT would show mobs killed i think
[0:56:17] n0fragtv: trying my first prime drink today Pog
[0:56:18] linkitcraig: not the levels
[0:56:22] Snaketrap: NA 42
[0:56:27] ironbull007: what about boon?
[0:56:27] aengelmonhster: @dankwizard420 2 is after 1 man
[0:56:40] retau_: i think you're right craig
[0:56:41] Masteve: did u look at the rune leaks mr staysafe
[0:56:41] windatar: @abdarahyin I'm saying he probably sold the gold he got from GDKP's. Why would he buy it? He probably did GDKP's with people who bought it, stored the gold and sold it to RMT sites. No more GDKP no more RMT for him.
[0:56:43] DankWizard420: @aengelmonhster I only count with roman numerals Susge
[0:56:46] abdarahyin: @AFKJG Or... ban the incentive to have bots in the first place??? Why bot if you can't sell gold... flosstPLINK
[0:56:52] g0dzilla: @AFKJG there will be ways arround it, yes... but i thing blizz is going hard on them... if enforcement is good, they will get punished
[0:56:53] tsetse2fly: @Piorum_ It for sure tracks mobs, dunno if adds are added to that
[0:57:04] whymaib12: 1
[0:57:10] minihansen12: Is this for a video?
[0:57:12] Juubbz: ive been gone, is @StaysafeTV in favor of the GDKP ban?
[0:57:13] Deomas11: Cutting demand for gold buying is a smarter play than attacking the supply (bots).
[0:57:31] jimbonni: any one knows ?will my boots go out [Extraplanar Spidersilk Boots]if i drop tailer?
[0:57:36] numblezzz: @g0dzilla meanwhile people like sodapoppin openly buying gold, but didnt even get suspended. just had their gold removed
[0:57:39] tsetse2fly: @Juubbz yes
[0:57:41] AFKJG: @AFKJG banning gdkp's to get rid of bots? what about the pickpocketing bots, the herbalism bots, the mining bots, the farming bots? they will just run the AH as they usually do, GDKP or not
[0:57:43] g0dzilla: @Deomas11 Its not that easy bro... otherwise it would happen
[0:57:48] aerodynam1c: pogg i caught a stream live
[0:57:49] Masteve: Did he look at the runes yet? : )
[0:58:22] tyrone710: yoooo
[0:58:25] g0dzilla: @numblezzz, idk why, if and what happened with soda... but i guess, blizz has reasons why they didnt...
[0:58:33] mazian4: @StaysafeTV Updated dungeon loot too
[0:58:46] bottlekiddz: Shaman 2h Poggers, warlock lack of AOE left me sad
[0:58:46] windatar: @AFKJG Bot population is based on how many people are buying gold for the server. GDKP being banned cuts back on the buyers. Which means botters get lower payouts. Higher chance they move their opterations to a different version of wow where the market isn't banned.
[0:58:47] numblezzz: @g0dzilla i was just using soda as an example. they have been soft on all gold buyers
[0:58:53] AFKJG: I don't buy gold though, it's just nice to join a GDKP and earn a little gold. i've never personally made a bunch, but just enough to buy raid mats and shit. maybe i'm the minority then?
[0:59:09] NutterCircus: the new meta is going to be lvling without questing for the gold at max lvl.
[0:59:16] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[0:59:18] aerodynam1c: get inside his mind
[0:59:21] spansonite1: <3
[0:59:34] jodihighrolly: he walks to the edge and turns around
[0:59:41] g0dzilla: @numblezzz, well, gold buyer arnt the only issue... and sometimes its better to leave buyer to get the seller... seller are #1 prio...
[0:59:46] numblezzz: @AFKJG many people have the same sentiment as you, but yeah the gold is fundamentally coming from bots/sellers so its bad for the game
[0:59:47] AFKJG: @AFKJG I can see your point, that makes sense. I am curious to see how they ban GDKP. cant they just rename it to community funded run or some shit? make a guild and raid with gdkp rules? hmm
[1:00:01] AFKJG: @AFKJG I see your point
[1:00:04] Deomas11: @AFKJG Where do you think the majoirty of GDKP gold comes from? The best GDKP payouts always have gold buyers in the group.
[1:00:13] DankWizard420: @AFKJG it'l be the transfer of gold
[1:00:25] mjaumjaumjaum: GDKP replaced by FAPDKP there solved
[1:00:29] abdarahyin: @AFKJG Exactly... why buy gold 3rd party when 10% of your GDKP raid buys gold??? You still benefit from gold buying.
[1:00:34] linkitcraig: ok
[1:00:35] g0dzilla: @afkjg, no... it wont be that easy to avoid violating the gdkp  rule
[1:00:38] AFKJG: @AFKJG I've done 10-20 GDKP runs and averaged like 5-20g per run, i've never made boujee ass money in a GDKP lol
[1:00:44] spike82q: those 400g shoulders though
[1:00:55] dirbagdan: what about the stone dudes?
[1:00:59] spike82q: yeah need a hunter and pet to tank it
[1:01:01] minihansen12: @StaysafeTV Pigs and the beastmasters pull together
[1:01:04] holy_molar: The Pigs are tied to the Handlers, not the Warrior mobs
[1:01:06] sliizew: you pulled his pet :)

[1:01:26] Kukiap0: Kukiap0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:01:30] hypnoidal: mining bars*
[1:01:31] windatar: But I mean, if discord/raid leaders are dropping out of doing GDKP's then thats that for most GDKP's. After all, they wont happen if there is no one leading them.
[1:01:37] linkitcraig: i have a spreadsheet
[1:01:37] Kukiap0: hi :)
[1:01:40] seimmavi: Make a guild, transfer gold with guild bank, use some 1g items instead of gold itself, ppl will find way around it and blizzard will shit themselves like they usually do
[1:01:46] windatar: Regular casual wow players already don't want to raid lead.
[1:01:47] windatar: Lol
[1:01:54] AFKJG: @Kukiap0 agree
[1:01:54] NutterCircus: Any counters in the chat? KEKL
[1:01:56] g0dzilla: @hypnoidal Try it out and tell us :D
[1:02:13] g0dzilla: All those WHAT IF questions
[1:02:14] dirk_Sora: pepeLaugh what if?
[1:02:17] tsetse2fly: Nerdge
[1:02:20] abdarahyin: @AFKJG The game shouldn't benefit you, the minority, when there's a plague ruining the game going on.... Thankfully you can just PLAY the game for 10 minutes and make 20g anyways so you're not affected.
[1:02:24] Deomas11: There's always a workaround, but if the workaround is complex, nobody will do it.
[1:02:26] g0dzilla: Try it guys... if you get banned, you know what you did wrong :D
[1:02:31] g0dzilla: Easy
[1:02:33] spike82q: than proceeds to post discord link
[1:02:36] ATcaribou: yeah those people are called idiots
[1:02:37] Daddecool: Perhaps we can use them to strengthen our starcruisers

[1:03:06] 3PO_SitHappen: everybody thinks the smarte :D
[1:03:07] AFKJG: Streamers shouldn't be allowed to take viewer gold if it's THAT easy to earn gold LUL
[1:03:13] TheReam: TheReam subscribed with Prime.

[1:03:20] Nightbot: @pilapicante -> LANGUAGE VIOLATION [warning]
[1:03:20] windatar: There are discords being spun up just to Narc on GDKP discords. There is dozens if not hundreds of players banding together to do blizzards jobs for them. For the LULz. Which is pretty funny.
[1:03:26] OrangeBar86: @StaysafeTV Your nightbot think its not allowed to say good evening LUL
[1:03:26] dirbagdan: We're gonna start seeing weird shit posted in LFG chat as code for GDKP
[1:03:37] bullriko: what do you think about the future dot critting? is this to much?
[1:03:44] jimbonni: so true
[1:03:53] dirbagdan: @windatar Where can I sign up?
[1:03:58] Deomas11: All it takes is one snitch (who's sour about loot) to rat out a GDKP and get everyone banned. Nobody will risk is secretly
[1:04:02] Nightbot: @pilapicante -> LANGUAGE VIOLATION
[1:04:07] abdarahyin: @dirbagdan All it takes is for 1 guy to report a raid he's in when he realizes it's a GDKP.
[1:04:14] jimbonni: ar u guys still QQ about GDKP xD
[1:04:17] NutterCircus: Lets face it, some of that gold you see being given to streamers is paid for by the streamers.

[1:06:23] g0dzilla: @Amp_III look good for what?
[1:06:26] abdarahyin: Pugging is easily going to not be mostly GDKPs anymore, even if dudes go on secret discords to risk anyone joining who's not on board with a single arid to jeopardize the entire fucking operation.

[1:09:20] abdarahyin: @ATcaribou They also lack 0% care for any sense of geography. Ruins my immersion if I can't logically conclude the economical factors in the development of rival civilizations.
[1:09:25] foldp: and how does grouping affect that?
[1:09:26] wavecadet: @StaysafeTV you see that they are updating Dungeon gear? Looks like a lot of Caster gear specifically is getting buffed

[1:14:27] Evilgelato: this is guaranteed xp/hour as there is no contest and no ganking
[1:14:36] bottlekiddz: im curious with the banning of GDKP, if it just turns the currency into a new from. Start using Thorum bars as gold or something
[1:14:36] linkitcraig: ~1.2 hour levels i think?
[1:14:46] Evilgelato: staysafe, do u know the jugle aoe pull spot in rfk?

[1:15:51] Lionkingler1: cant wait for mage to ding 40 within 2 hours
[1:15:53] Ryafl1: i thought they were nerfing mage healing
[1:15:55] DankWizard420: 7? monkaSpin
[1:15:59] wavecadet: are you leveling warlock first?
[1:16:04] RobinSamaGaim: taking to much time killing elites test killing normal mobs in the open world

[1:16:40] artilectXLII: ...so does anyone have any guesses on the region that will host the PVP-carnage at phase with level 50? feralas? hinterlands?
[1:16:41] seimmavi: @bottlekiddz Blizzard has room temp iq and gonna shit themselves like they usually doo

[1:17:35] therealrickdiculous: SM probably
[1:17:41] boxhead66: cant fear in GY
[1:17:43] bronzeruse: solo rfk grinding? that really going to be good?
[1:17:44] WhaleBlast: SM is cool
[1:17:45] HrdScp: do you not want to group?
[1:17:48] Lionkingler1: 30
[1:17:49] wavecadet: 29-30
[1:17:49] TheBootyBoyTV: 31? 32?
[1:17:51] WhaleBlast: SM looks cool
[1:17:54] bottlekiddz: @seimmavi i think the gold just gets turned into another currency. Weather its a guild what sells DKP for gold. People are always 2 steps ahead of the developers
[1:17:56] dirbagdan: 28 depending on role
[1:17:57] Lionkingler1: lockouts gonna fuck you otherwise
[1:17:59] lizcat_: 27/28?
[1:18:06] minihansen12: you never want to do SM gy if u can skip it

[1:18:41] Furuluru: @maverrick15 for one fun clear?
[1:18:59] yuckil: pig maxxing
[1:19:04] linkitcraig: is it SoD with reduced xp to mobs and bosses give more xp?
[1:19:11] ATcaribou: you can juggle them on the thorn up top. its worth it
[1:19:14] Ruinx81: What other classes can solo this efficiently? Hunter and rogue?
[1:19:30] maverrick15: @Furuluru if it wasnt gonna be alot of xp they wouldnt even of mentioned it
[1:19:44] spookystylo: you got your pre quests ready for turn in?
[1:19:55] seimmavi: @seimmavi Yeah, probably. Hopefully blizz will get rid of this idea and let ppl play the game the way they want to. I dont like being forced to join some loot system when gdkp was perfectly fine for me already
[1:19:57] Furuluru: @maverrick15 true, they stated significant
[1:20:03] WhaleBlast: holy shit BatChest
[1:20:07] KrotonGG: use the secret root thorn technique
[1:20:10] dirbagdan: lol
[1:20:12] wavecadet: KEKL

[1:20:16] TheBootyBoyTV: kekw
[1:20:18] jimbonni: omg
[1:20:26] jimbonni: LOL
[1:20:27] maverrick15: @Furuluru so its obviously nto confirmed but my guess is about a level
[1:20:33] justlootzhs: *by running to the tip of the briar
[1:20:33] dirbagdan: Deadge
[1:20:37] therealrickdiculous: the frenzy boars slap at low health
[1:20:40] didactylos6: no falling dmg here?
[1:20:47] WhaleBlast: restart?
[1:20:57] wavecadet: Soulstone Madge

[1:22:03] Derderf: i dont think so
[1:22:04] sound_wayv: cant fear
[1:22:12] linkitcraig: @ATcaribou ah, u might be right
[1:22:17] ryufromstreets6: are you not doing a quest stack?
[1:22:18] UfigZ: would need a group for sm
[1:22:22] KrotonGG: @staysafetv you can use the thorn on the root to make the boars path back on forth and never reach you. just go to the tip of thorn then to base of thorn
[1:22:24] WhaleBlast: oh two mages
[1:22:25] WhaleBlast: frosts
[1:22:45] PeasantNoMore: Lib is too stacked, fear is not an option there right?

[3:04:09] kingpincognito: You think people would be open to a ban on GDKP bidding, but not the buy-in? They say the gold distribution at the end is what keeps pugs from leaving. And the bidding is what drives RMT. Compromise? idk
[3:04:40] NutterCircus: ZERO GDKP... SUFFER IN SILENCE.
[3:05:16] snake_like: I use mistletoe to bribe people to mistletoe me. 20 spirit is not bad especially with lock mana issues in p1

[3:09:46] staymoonkinJR: @StaysafeTV the GDKP Mafia is seeking your location and they are not happy Madge
[3:09:46] Robglobgubob: I hope all the spell power stuff brings casters up. Having boomie buffs might close some gap but berserker stance just hits so hard
[3:09:54] snake_like: sanest 4chan user clawing at the smallest iota of power their regarded mind can comprehend

[3:13:12] Bobersale: only fans doesnt have to be nude content.
[3:13:12] Lionkingler1: had the same thing happen to some other person I followed
[3:13:13] dreadd39: omg that disgusting. where? so i know where to avoid it

[3:14:38] VegaCP: @spike82q I subbed to your mother's last night flotSirenSong

[3:15:06] numblezzz: you need to find a fetish niche
[3:15:12] KCYON: there was a very small twitch streamer that had 20 viewers reguarily that has 100-200 viewers now. she had an OF at 20 viewers
[3:15:14] ScarfaceCEO: Once you sell that type of content it takes a piece of you that you can never get back.
[3:15:19] NutterCircus: Yea, you aint gonna boom on twitch... unless you are boosted by big streamers. PauseChamp
[3:15:27] soupxhot: if I did OF i'd only do feet pics but any chick I've heard does it goes from mild stuff to hardcore content in like 3-6 months of starting
[3:15:30] kaiju_kin: amouranth makes <.1% of what she makes now if she started there
[3:15:37] DankWizard420: still in the 100s KEKW
[3:15:39] serioux1993: but guys give way more money on onlyfans than twitch if they are hooked
[3:15:42] squidgeymane: I got like 100 viewers atm and it still feels impossible lol
[3:15:47] iBanEvader: you can make it if you're very talented
[3:15:50] KCYON: 100 is very difficult
[3:15:58] numblezzz: amouranth makes all hey money from turkish dudes that cant figure out VPNs
[3:16:05] NutterCircus: There are ALOT of very pretty girls on Twitch.
[3:16:16] KCYON: that is the only silver lining
[3:16:17] dreadd39: then there is palmbee, perfection.
[3:16:19] KCYON: lool
[3:16:25] DankWizard420: it 100% helps for the initial low viewer barrier, but the ceiling still exists
[3:16:27] zestyerb: u gotta have a huge ass
[3:16:31] RIPNARsty: PoroSad
[3:16:36] NutterCircus: I love Palmbee, she is such a darling.

[3:50:34] fake_based: yea imagine that
[3:50:35] savagelo256: on*
[3:50:43] rsSilence: Yes, I think swatting should be treated as attempted 1st degree murder and absolutely deserves the death penalty
[3:50:54] unresolvedbroccoli: holy balls im reading about this person. sh!ts pretty fckd up
[3:50:55] numblezzz: hot take, there should be a higher category than "proven without reasonable doubt" that allows torture for obscene crimes
[3:50:59] Tbird65: I feel the same way about drunk driving...not so much the death penalty but that the punishment should be much more severe
[3:51:03] justjones37: in the medieval age they did that
[3:51:10] tepsx: what made you decide not to stay Engi?
[3:51:26] AxelFromAustralia: was there such thing as swatting before streamers?

[3:51:35] Farenheight451: im glad they made the pvp trinket remove everything because rogues are going to be gross
[3:51:37] imradioaktive: the older I get the more I get it
[3:51:41] Zaziben: public executions
[3:51:42] nardurah: people need to have some limits or death
[3:51:44] surtayne: Public stonings would be LIT
[3:51:50] moneyfornothing69: the government shouldn't tolerate people putting tax payers and their cops at risk because some nerd gets teen angst. It's bad for business.
[3:51:52] carlos_the_7th: It only makes sense
[3:51:53] pisketti: guillotine or deportation for  Ilhan Omar, her choice :)

[3:53:23] cl_ogar0: @cptnkuroky IN USA you just get shot if you dont raise 2 hands on time

[3:55:00] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV my dad had an accident with one of the most infamous criminals in history and the stockholm syndrome originated from him https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Olofsson
[3:55:11] iBanEvader: kinda crazy how szmall the world is
[3:55:15] AxelFromAustralia: did swatting exist before streaming @staysafetv?
[3:55:24] pisketti: errrr, technically the SWAT team doesn't use AR-15s Nerdge
[3:55:37] fake_based: they have to check it out for sure
[3:55:47] spike82q: what if it was meth fueled psychoses
[3:55:49] DobsonWireless: Did you get swatted while you had the infant child at home?
[3:55:52] N_Tys: anyone sympathetic to the swatter doesn't have kids and a family.
[3:55:57] aBradAbroad: agreed, and punish the people who endanger that system severly
[3:55:59] thisyaboycam: I don't think its real bro
[3:56:00] clamthenerd: I think people should be investigated if they use uwu
[3:56:01] DobsonWireless: that sucks
[3:56:05] Noitheknight333: but if you get swatted once. the police department should have a note or record of a false positive report

[3:56:28] unresolvedbroccoli: did you have a VPN when that all happened?
[3:56:31] iBanEvader: it's funny how small the world is
[3:56:36] Robglobgubob: that scared the crap out of me
[3:56:40] numblezzz: @Noitheknight333 most big streamers now contact their local police department to warn about fake call ins
[3:56:55] numblezzz: cops are pretty informed about it now
[3:56:59] HrdScp: I think death sentence would be bad cuz some of those mfs probably don't even want to live
[3:57:02] rsSilence: The proper response is for the police to take it seriously until it's evident that it was a swatting incident, then apologize profusely to the victim and work with them to make any future attempts less harmful.
[3:57:14] h2h_nillz: 50 to be safe
[3:57:20] carlos_the_7th: @HrdScp 2 birds, 1 stone

[4:10:44] teis05: brings things alive
[4:10:51] NutterCircus: I like to RP on Crusader Strike.
[4:10:56] saund: Instead of people RPing, they could actively try to find a relationship with Jesus Christ, would do them way more good
[4:10:58] Shocklate_: Yo @StaysafeTV
[4:11:02] KCYON: it'd be nice to be playing a game and the rp'ers are memeing around

[4:12:35] fart_boiii: its best when u can drive ur car into everyone
[4:12:44] spike82q: just fat shaming everyone at the burger oint lmao
[4:12:46] relyt1981: good evening staysafe!
[4:12:51] NutterCircus: GTA RP is just doing outside shit while you are inside.
[4:12:54] Mauraderss: and if you miss 2 days of watching you are out of the loop because so much happens in that time
[4:12:56] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV I literally stopped watching television because of all the reality bullshit and ads and now it's here on twitch with GTA RP LUL
[4:12:58] numblezzz: gta rp stopped being funny when they banned the racist caricatures
[4:13:01] rawreefers: there he is
[4:13:32] fake_based: it was cool for like a week
[4:14:05] KCYON: i remember watching one where they were actually killing shit, stealing helicopters, that was p cool
[4:14:05] spike82q: what if were a simulation, and being controlled by the 4th dimensional being,  and were all just just Rp avatars right now
[4:14:06] EarSlug: t pain got to work for rock star because he was on gta rp
[4:14:09] Mauraderss: GTARP blew up during lockdowns because everyone had so much free time
[4:14:25] spike82q: *hits blunt * whoa
[4:14:33] KCYON: and it really depends on the streamer, theres only one dude that i could watch do gta rp lool

[4:15:20] trippledipperski: hes talking about the lw haste gloves
[4:15:22] spike82q: tailoring has epic boots
[4:15:23] NutterCircus: Its in Atlas loot under LW
[4:15:27] dustydollars2121: @spike82q your soul is the 4th dimensional being running your 3 dimensional body
[4:15:28] spike82q: blacksmithing ahs epic chest
[4:15:36] bots_bots: guys hes a boomkin why would he want melee haste gloves
[4:15:51] corsair714: Did you talk about GDKP ban!?
[4:15:55] spike82q: @dustydollars2121  * blows mind *  whoa dude

[4:16:49] Mauraderss: blizzard finally read staysafes comment from the suggestion box Pog
[4:17:05] saund: Thr changes to phase 2 makes me not feel bad about paying a monthly subscription again
[4:17:08] corsair714: Chat whats gunna be bis next phase? Am I fucked as a rogue?
[4:17:18] numblezzz: asmon said GDKPs are great for the game tho
[4:17:29] dustydollars2121: @StaysafeTV Have you seen the movie Highlander? Thoughts on it?
[4:17:29] LegendFromWoW: it ruins runs with people who paid for carries and shouldnt be there
[4:17:30] Tomoglaziat: All I see is on Edge is gold selling sites it is descrasfull
[4:17:44] numblezzz: ban both monkaHmm
[4:17:44] daughtylock: daughtylock subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Been a great 20 months!
[4:17:49] iBanEvader: GDKP ban is collateral damage
[4:17:53] avoidedneXt: asmon's take is always a utilitarian argument
[4:17:53] slaysin05: its good in a world where goldbuying doesnt exist but thats not gona happen
[4:17:55] koctopus: GDKP in a perfect world is great when no one buys gold thru rmt and farms it themselves
[4:17:57] iBanEvader: I'm also not 100% happy with it
[4:18:00] NutterCircus: The botting is a gravey train for Blizz.
[4:18:01] koctopus: but that aint the case
[4:18:02] garbobean: i dont care about gdkp, but the chat spam was unbelievable in LFG
[4:18:04] kaiju_kin: for real, it will literally never happen
[4:18:06] sigilfish: probably little bit all
[4:18:08] papa_bunnz: no difference in effort to banning bots vs. banning GDKP. they'll fail at both
[4:18:09] spike82q: I agree with your take GDKP's would be okay IF the gold being oscillated around  wassn't from botted applications
[4:18:10] numblezzz: they are way too easy on gold buyers. people are willing to buy gold because they only do wrist slaps
[4:18:17] BonustrackTV: but then how would asmon and 96% of other streamers get their gold lol?
[4:18:22] numblezzz: if people lost their accounts, gold buying would stop
[4:18:23] vejitas4: @staysafetv GDKPS are bad gold buying or not
[4:18:29] joelp904: Will you play HC again?
[4:18:39] iBanEvader: worth a try I agree with that
[4:18:46] Mauraderss: gold buying was a thing back in 2009 even, but it never really destroyed the economy
[4:18:46] iBanEvader: don't think it will change that much
[4:19:04] gressil1234: in classic you need to farm gold 4 hours a week for consumes if you want to raid, how will this fix gold selling issue?
[4:19:06] spike82q: now people will have to do older raids out fo the kindness of there hearts
[4:19:32] numblezzz: ban it all monkaGun purge all corruption
[4:19:35] xxgriimez: super off topic but what can we do to end the onlypans plague this shit is getting out of hand @StaysafeTV
[4:19:48] Radtvlol: BASED
[4:19:50] NutterCircus: Asmon gets funneled gold so ofcourse he is for GDKP.
[4:19:52] LegendFromWoW: They don't have the resources for a proactive enforcement.
[4:20:08] aBradAbroad: LUL
[4:20:09] Frayeen: I mean people are mad because gdkp is majority of wow playerbase in classic/sod
[4:20:10] fart_boiii: if only it was narnia
[4:20:16] Lunights: evidently the price of gold dropped by 50% on sod servers after the gdkp ban. so clearly this is a good move in the right direction
[4:20:23] ZaffronXXX: thats how you start to create new ideas, complaining is the agony of the psyche that leads to evolution
[4:20:28] vejitas4: @staysafetv you are correct 100% killing rmt wont happen, all you can do is bring it ad low as posible
[4:20:31] corsair714: Gold 50% off you say?? brb
[4:20:32] dustydollars2121: Exactly so build a wall like Israel has.... Their wall is BADASS!!! noone getting through that thing
[4:20:51] iBanEvader: @Frayeen nah I barely see GDKPs yet in SoD
[4:20:57] JetGC: I think its funny you guys play season of discovery when blizzard out of the kindness of their hearts gave us retail wow and the non binary dragons
[4:20:58] h2h_nillz: What made you roll horde on SoD?
[4:21:06] numblezzz: i said this earlier, but sodapoppin was openly buying gold for weeks. blizz didnt suspend him, only took his gold
[4:21:13] numblezzz: punishments like that encourage buying
[4:21:23] JetGC: you agree?
[4:21:28] corsair714: @JetGC Yea but Sod has the they/them lock pet thats why @StaysafeTV plays it
[4:21:31] NutterCircus: Silk Will.
[4:21:33] spike82q: im surprised they don't implement a Daily type quest at  maxed level in that phase,

[4:41:10] NutterCircus: The whole box thing is a freaking TROLL if you ask me.
[4:41:17] cjadude: life isnt just about boxes ss
[4:41:18] Jurassitol: They're inflating away the value of American voters
[4:41:19] heylowdub: Go to the tigers eye emerald spot its bis

[4:42:24] Pelgresh: ???? KEKW
[4:42:28] Furydeath9: already stocked up on cheap items for the new waylay boxes too EZ
[4:42:28] Jurassitol: Good
[4:42:35] NutterCircus: It would be diff if you could carry more than one box, but one box till you go to a capital is a bit much.
[4:42:40] sixpackchad: @StaysafeTV thoughts on zuckerberg's testimony before the senate judicial hearing? or the tiktok CEO?
[4:42:40] ZeroSugarGod7: LUL
[4:42:50] Jurassitol: They're patriots
[4:42:51] NutterCircus: Its called Nationalism.
[4:42:51] fuzeb0x_: sounds BASED to me

[4:43:30] iknowido: america sold itself
[4:43:38] NutterCircus: One of the reasons why you never see Americans telling Japan how to run their country.
[4:43:41] Jurassitol: I identify as a skinless american
[4:43:49] caltex88: Every country other than Canada and U.S. do it that way
[4:43:50] numblezzz: remember that the taiwanese government is a civil war faction that still claims ownership of the mainland, only exists because of american intervention
[4:43:55] DobsonWireless: I think im speaking japanese I really think so.......
[4:44:01] scrubknightx: damn i was just listening to this song while deadlifting

[4:46:33] Aphrayel: Im from New Zealand, its so weird to me that people other than americans can vote in the american election.
[4:46:34] MC_WhiteNoiz: What we need is to take back our economy from oversized corporations ruining the American dream of engaging in commerce in good faith. All previous societies had redistributions of wealth. We silo it over multiple generations in corporations, not people.
[4:46:47] NutterCircus: I think I would moongarden port to fly to TB.

[4:47:43] Aphrayel: @numblezzz Britains dont vote in our elections. You have to be a New zealand citizen to vote in our elections
[4:47:49] AxelFromAustralia: we need to acknowledge the traditional owners or the barrens, the Kolkar, welcome to country Staysafe

[4:49:33] numblezzz: international IQ maps monkaLaugh
[4:49:45] MC_WhiteNoiz: Yup, like democracy. We need to have healthy citizens. but we destroy our society for the sake of the bottom line.
[4:49:49] coolcrazyguy72: we live in a society

[5:02:07] NutterCircus: Jefferson said something like that.
[5:02:13] madgarlicjr: now we all vote and its meaningless cuz the deep state controls everything anyway

[5:03:43] numblezzz: catholics Madge
[5:03:54] spike82q: tthe modern American school system is primarily to provide trained and obedient workers to fuel America's expanding industrial economy,  shut up vote and die in war

[5:04:09] cleannjerkk: the only reason imo that the women dont fight is because its way easier to rebuild a society with 2 man and 100 women then 2 women and 100 man

[5:05:08] NutterCircus: Back then your race was determined by what we consider nationality now days.
[5:05:08] spike82q: Irish ppl were slaves ,  look at early american posts " Irish need not apply"  they only became acceptable when " white people " started to become a minority

[5:05:50] rsSilence: The Irish became acceptable when the Union wanted them to die in Southern cotton fields.
[5:05:51] numblezzz: before the brother wars taught us we were one people Sadge
[5:06:02] AxelFromAustralia: you don’t think any part of it was to control women? it wasn’t just a matter of military service, women have been oppressed worldwide at the time and still to this day in the middle east

[5:07:19] devvastate: FACTS
[5:07:25] father_ruckus_: well,  fuck the current pope,  fucking commie

[5:07:46] tendollafatha: jefferson was fiercely loyal to france
[5:07:50] numblezzz: i mean, its more rooted in anglo hatred of catholics. anglos built early america
[5:08:02] NutterCircus: The founders were a bunch of smart guys in their 20s

[5:11:27] therealrickdiculous: probably
[5:11:27] scrubknightx: They might add new boxes that give more rep too
[5:11:27] iBanEvader: yes easily
[5:11:28] chazburner: but you would have to go back
[5:11:29] xD_Big_Cat: To honored? 100% yes
[5:11:30] gryphsx: close enough prob
[5:11:31] corsair714: We barely got honored
[5:11:32] mattygisme: Yes but that's a lot of extra travelling imo
[5:11:32] Deomas11: If whenever you get a box, you fill it and hand it in, then yes.
[5:11:34] rsSilence: I think they need to allow us to carry more than 1 box at a time in P2
[5:11:35] helloiamlucas: they may change the box system too and make it easier
[5:11:36] chazburner: it's only like 16 boxes to honored
[5:11:38] rsSilence: It's such a bad restriction
[5:11:39] Farenheight451: what if that rune is good for leveling
[5:11:41] gryphsx: the higher lvl boxes will give more rep id guess
[5:11:43] divadnothsa: seems like the  higher lvl25 boxs give 800 rep its safe to assume the 30+ give 1k?
[5:11:44] Piorum_: higher level boxes will give more rep
[5:11:45] madgarlicjr: peepoHappy
[5:11:50] Lonny_Packs: Box grind is the best from the minile outside ogrimmar. Fast run there and logout skip back.
[5:11:54] 5by_five: i think the constant stops to turn em in is gonna be a slog for your levelin @StaysafeTV
[5:11:56] bboofit: maybe but are you going to interrupt questing everytime you get a box to turn it in?
[5:12:07] bots_bots: so not super saiyan 3 but 2?
[5:12:10] KingIngeborg: just farm rep chest now in higher zones (20+) then u get more rep
[5:12:39] madgarlicjr: if anything, at 40 you can go back to these zones and just kill things faster and make it EZ

[5:21:46] iBanEvader: @chazburner quality of life are books you find in dungeons

[7:44:27] SlapaH03: just ask them on twitter
[7:44:30] dj_clerik: they probably won't give rep either. bet blizz caps the low lvl boxes at honored
[7:44:41] Mehmehran: they will have buffed xp for new players, because of that new buff. but highly doubt it'll be worth for players at 25

[7:47:01] Vigo__M: What are you up to Staysafe?
[7:47:03] OrganikCum: gonna be honest i hate this new box rep shit
[7:47:04] SourMilkNPennies: not like there's anything else to do in this game
[7:47:05] Smokjoker: im interested in reading a book what book do you recommend to read? @StaysafeTV
[7:47:08] IR_ish: what about that cave in stonetalon, didn't you get a boatload of boxeS?
[7:47:14] IR_ish: minus the PvP ofcourse
[7:47:15] christiangodwarrior97: i think it might be faster to farm these boxes at the venture qo cave next to orgrimmar and then using  the logout skip
[7:47:18] mith124: i still play wrath so prob not a lot
[7:47:20] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[7:47:23] jcurt03: How is wasting 100 hours ahead of time worth saving like 2 hrs on launch
[7:47:49] numblezzz: wait, is he farming boxes for next phase? blizz historically makes turn ins not work on future releases
[7:48:03] numblezzz: i'd bet money they turn gray
[7:48:04] omarali118: it's easy if you have the special orange helper
[7:48:06] TesservcT: Oldge
[7:48:20] windatar: I usually do a rotation in my farm spot and as soon as I get a regular crate I go to a captial city auction house everything I get and then go back. I generally get a half dozen crates an hour and roughly 3-5 gold.
[7:48:22] oochie1: 30 hours for 25-40 seems pretty long
[7:48:42] Skiddy1987: you have any alts in SOD?
[7:48:43] Unvoiced_: What are your plans for first gnomer clear? straight in there when you ding?
[7:49:02] popeyeformedellin: @windatar " I just waste my time cuz i have no idea how and what to do "
[7:49:05] NutterCircus: On launch thats fast, you spend first 12 hours fighting for tags.
[7:49:09] windatar: Isn't 25-40 twice the experience then 1-25?
[7:49:09] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV did you see that clip of Ayanna Pressley saying its racist because Walgreens closed in a black neighborhood because of theft lol
[7:49:35] avoidedneXt: @cyonara74 make sure you get really angry over the news
[7:49:38] numblezzz: the claim of racism when retailers close in ghettos has been around a long time
[7:49:42] Piorum_: I did some dungeon grinding tests in a 5 man and we are expecting pessimistically 45k xp an hour in rfk
[7:49:42] omarali118: She's the bald black woman on the "Squad"
[7:49:45] avoidedneXt: everybody get angry about race now
[7:49:50] Mungtime: I would also close my business if theft was constant
[7:49:57] windatar: @popeyeformedellin What you never mindlessly do something while listening to an audible book? Lol.
[7:50:14] bboofit: hillbrad quests?
[7:50:17] mundanesickle: considering speed runs to 25 are about 8-12. I wouldnt be surprised if we see the first 40s within 24 hours with all this prep time
[7:50:20] tactical_rage_quit: you need to shave time and are fresh out of razors
[7:50:34] OrganikCum: you going from 25-28ish with wsg marks?
[7:50:48] numblezzz: @STREAMSNIPELUL the post said raid groups will be negatively impacted
[7:50:48] oochie1: that's like four good quests you've got in TB alone
[7:51:02] bboofit: any quests in hillsbrad?
[7:51:13] ryufromstreets6: did you do 1k needles quests
[7:51:15] JohnWick_QQ: stone talon
[7:51:17] garbobean: anything in thousand needles?
[7:51:18] JohnWick_QQ: ashenvale?
[7:51:20] JohnWick_QQ: nothing?
[7:51:21] numblezzz: @STREAMSNIPELUL oh gotcha. yeah thats problematic, didnt think of that
[7:51:29] garbobean: theres a bunch in TN that are really easy
[7:51:36] izikperz: run to stocks man
[7:52:02] dr_cia_again: last good movie you saw mr safe?
[7:52:21] Brenno_Mc: those TM quests are all long chains
[7:52:22] DumbledorSoD: tailoring eng or tailoring ench for mage healer/dps
[7:52:32] antimondez: thousand needles?
[7:52:46] christiangodwarrior97: who would win, a dad gamer with prep time, or an adderal sniffing, monster chugging, jobless classic andy.
[7:52:54] ryufromstreets6: thousand needles should be good to prequest in
[7:53:07] Brenno_Mc: have you done all of southern barrens?
[7:53:22] handovdoom666: @DumbledorSoD if you do tailor/ench you can make sure and DE it to raise your Enchant skill
[7:53:34] mattbarz989: Yeah requesting isn't that bad 20 question stack cast
[7:53:42] handovdoom666: @handovdoom666 make stuff*
[7:53:59] anfractuous17: you can make a turn in route to make it more efficient
[7:54:09] ragef1st: 1 week baby
[7:54:24] oochie1: @StaysafeTV taurajo is pretty efficient if you're doing a full route because it's just a quick stop and then you continue flying to 1k
[7:54:29] ryufromstreets6: would the travel time to go there to turn it in be less exp than rfk grinding though?
[7:54:38] therattmoth: Hillsbrad, Hearth to 1K, fly Camp T, Fly TB, Fly Stonetalon, Fly Zoram to BFD for XP  thats my turn in schedule
[7:54:42] windatar: With how strong BFD made people for their level wouldn't dungeon running with 5 people be the best way to level up?
[7:54:49] garbobean: you can get steelsnap in TB for thousand needles
[7:54:55] DenZoHunter: group of bodyguard?
[7:55:03] numblezzz: @windatar thats what im thinking
[7:55:08] OrganikCum: you spamming wsg all day on the 7th?
[7:55:12] zaebot3000: YES :D
[7:55:13] voreal22: what level for RFK?
[7:55:16] studshift: Not I
[7:55:18] NutterCircus: lets go
[7:55:18] Brenno_Mc: Camp T has all of the named mobs around it that you can kill now and it drops something to start a Q
[7:55:22] old_old_old_doug: id go
[7:55:32] Plathyy: I LOVE MY HUSBAND VIBE
[7:55:38] studshift: @StaysafeTV  howdy partner

[7:55:44] numblezzz: @Plathyy BASEDCIGAR
[7:55:48] cyonara74: get quests in tb
[7:55:50] garbobean: TB
[7:55:51] windatar: @numblezzz Thats what I'm going to do, my BFD group will split into two groups and just mass run instances to get ahead of the rest of the rat pack for quests. Lol.
[7:55:56] Plathyy: 1k
[7:56:00] ryufromstreets6: that's a TB quest, but you kill in 1k
[7:56:01] therattmoth: 1k needles turn in RB
[7:56:03] voreal22: TB
[7:56:03] therattmoth: TB

[7:56:13] dodgydad33: spirit cliff
[7:56:13] therattmoth: hunter rise
[7:56:17] voreal22: Hunter rise
[7:56:21] dodgydad33: hunter rise
[7:57:06] cashaga: lol that was me
[7:57:16] numblezzz: @cashaga HeyGuys

[7:58:55] zol_zolli: leatrix plus - thank you :)

[7:59:11] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[7:59:14] antimondez: they like 1800 - 2600
[7:59:24] HrdScp: I'm convinced Leatrix caused crashes in hc so I never installed it
[7:59:27] windatar: I kept my BFD raid quests just for phase 2. I bet those are like 3-4k each LOL.
[7:59:47] oochie1: @StaysafeTV the assassination note in 1k is really good because it has an immediate follow-up at the handin
[7:59:50] windatar: Also Alliance bfd raid quest rewards were ass anyway.
[8:00:11] numblezzz: eh i think its a non issue
[8:00:22] SlapaH03: BFD clear run should give XP too next phase
[8:00:28] bots_bots: did leveling in dungeons for prebis items anyway /shrug
[8:00:35] numblezzz: saving up xp for next phase is ultra autistic, shouldnt balance the game around it
[8:00:38] windatar: You know what fixes that meta? If Blizzard created new quest hubs when the next phase comes out at that level.
[8:00:42] numblezzz: just grind on release
[8:00:42] windatar: Really easy fix.
[8:00:49] deywa7: but the extra gold gives u a trade off and its your choice really
[8:00:54] thephilosophile: @staysafetv perhaps if they do this again they can create an xp bank type system?
[8:00:57] OrganikCum: im spamming wsg for marks on the 7th, going from 25 to 28 or so that way, then dungeon spamming. i don't mind it
[8:01:00] cadeg29: @staysafetv love your streams bro! keep it up

[8:01:56] cadeg29: lets have discussion about the border situation. Texas W
[8:02:07] AlphaSimply: theres a WA believe it or not shows all the best quest and the XP they give

[8:04:01] AceOfFlame: He actually was considered fat in their religion
[8:04:08] numblezzz: kinda cringe but he squats more than me so i cant talk shit
[8:04:09] Vehicle_King: If an American isn't fat they arent consuming enough and thus they are failures.
[8:04:16] AlphaSimply: He was a God, which prolly mean he wasn't real. Bc there is only one God Prayge
[8:04:38] cashaga: what's ridiculous is the range of Starsurge
[8:04:39] harvenius: "I'm not super morbidly obese, I'm doomsday prepping!"
[8:04:39] windatar: I mean wasn't being fat in olden times a sign of wealth? As in you could only be fat if you had enough wealth to be fat while literally everyone else was rail thin because of food insecurity?
[8:04:48] AlphaSimply: ICANT
[8:05:01] Chiphazzord: thors not real whats it matter
[8:05:03] Lionkingler1: according to obama
[8:05:06] AlphaSimply: He watched the latest Marvel movie, where Thor got overweight

[8:07:57] Arcsilin: nutter
[8:07:57] numblezzz: one down pepeLaugh
[8:08:27] windatar: @StaysafeTV The mobs here and higher level should give you the boxes that are high enough level for the bonus EXP come next phase. (They're not called low level crates)
[8:08:35] AceOfFlame: @windatar however during those times, war was rampart on every day basis so it also hard to be fat since your basic job was being physical
[8:09:07] windatar: @AceOfFlame Yep.
[8:09:25] timmeh_timbo: glhf

[8:20:53] bots_bots: saving pearl kinda wild
[8:20:57] VashSwagpede: GET EM

[8:25:25] cafrozed: Kappa
[8:25:32] DenZoHunter: why
[8:25:37] fviii: BASEDHALT enough is enough
[8:25:52] AlphaSimply: example: looks at Wrath
[8:25:55] artilectXLII: ...thoughts on maybe better enjoying/wallowing-in this unique experience of launch of phase 2 of SoD instead of level-grinding to max level in cringe ways? is it not better to take it slow & get the most enjoyment/content out of every second?
[8:26:09] AlphaSimply: Wrath is plagued
[8:26:39] bots_bots: the fact that you are typing that means you are the one with the problem
[8:26:42] KKonaStevieG: no it must be done Kappa
[8:26:46] zer0pov: So the issue Is not the gdkp at all. Is the gold purchase.
[8:26:52] re5onxnce: grind mobs 25-40 gather gold
[8:27:24] coiozzz: @zer0pov not even that. It's the botting
[8:27:27] AlphaSimply: Gold buying and bots is 100% the problem if GDKPs were a way to make $ it would be diff
[8:27:33] leroylol: hell ya brother
[8:27:36] MrPink604: are you stackin waylaid supplies for xp?
[8:27:52] AmericanDynamo: What dungeon are you doing?
[8:27:53] Brenno_Mc: which dungen?
[8:27:58] bots_bots: rfk
[8:28:04] lightkekerino: stack GOLD for next phase waylaids
[8:28:05] Goldbowser: i got 83 boxes. better than nothing
[8:28:10] MrPink604: but they said they're going to be reworked to give more
[8:28:14] AlphaSimply: DansGame
[8:28:31] bots_bots: @MrPink604 we aren't certain that buff will apply to 1-25 boxes
[8:28:35] itsae__: they will buff it tho
[8:28:36] Lionkingler1: values his time very very little
[8:28:38] heygoditsme: lmao
[8:28:38] Roo1993: what else u gonna do til p2
[8:28:41] Carlt4pult: didnt they wanna change exp ot those ?
[8:29:09] VashSwagpede: Did they confirm that or is that speculation?
[8:29:16] VashSwagpede: the current waylaids not getting buffed
[8:29:24] VashSwagpede: FUCK
[8:29:56] Dillsmof: You doing some pre questing big hog?
[8:30:37] MrPink604: he said "particularly for the ones in the 25-40 range" but implies the lower level ones will still get some benefit
[8:30:59] MrPink604: but some improvement on 200xp is probably not enough to justify
[8:31:30] sargent_baddy: ideally how much gold per 25 should we be comfortable with for p2 launch
[8:31:30] tsetse2fly: Wait why doesn't he like you?
[8:31:30] h2h_nillz: Its X BRO
[8:31:38] Goldbowser: if they change lower boxes, they will not tell us now. it will be blizz-style ninja buff
[8:31:38] bots_bots: he did not outright say the 1-25 wont get the buff
[8:31:42] noChance219: Wym he doesn't like you?
[8:31:49] MikeTheShow: vouch
[8:31:52] bots_bots: he said "increasing xp... particularly in the ones after 25
[8:31:54] numblezzz: the anti fat statements def hurt him
[8:31:55] coiozzz: YES
[8:31:57] MrPink604: I only use twitter to look at pictures of cute raccoons
[8:31:59] anfractuous17: in a space like twitch yeah
[8:32:02] Lionkingler1: very BASED tho

[9:00:39] aidsmeister1: @AceOfFlame 100% lmao. I'm glad it's been better than people anticipated!
[9:00:44] aidsmeister1: Contact a few PMs. I'm not in the US, but have experience dealing with residential and commercial property. Might be different there, but here they can be completely out of their depth but passive landlords don't realise how much stuff is being mishandled or being unattended to. You still need to keep a watchful eye - sometimes renting can be more work than you'd anticipate, even with a PM because you might need to step in if the PM really botches stuff up. Happened a few times with me.
[9:00:56] aidsmeister1: Sorry for the long message but thought it might be helpful :)

[9:03:49] IR_ish: i am a tenant

[9:59:20] dramatikdave: what specc is best for lock ?
[9:59:29] coolcrazyguy72: aboriginals in Australia weren’t even using bows when the British arrived. it’s highly likely there were societies who were greatly advanced compared to the rest of humans thousands of years ago
[9:59:35] pappej: They probably had wooden construction equipment like cranes etc. and engineers, I don't think it's such a strange feat as people make it out to be
[9:59:40] dramatikdave: lvling for example
[10:00:14] IR_ish: have you guys seen the massive stones used in constructing the base of the acropolis ?

[10:04:10] pappej: I'd assume the heaviest stoenes are at the base though
[10:04:13] Denz0TV: Not just heavy. But how accurate you had to place these giant ass blocks. Even an inch off and the structure would end up as a spiral and not a pyramid
[10:04:16] coolcrazyguy72: earths billions of years old man look at what humans have done in 2000 years
[10:04:17] pappej: So you wouldn't need to lift them
[10:04:28] aBradAbroad: mizkif started a gym?

[10:06:45] sanspeur: you fucking know tell us
[10:06:45] Denz0TV: Also how accurate you had to place those giant ass blocks. Even an inch off and the structure would end up as a spiral and not a pyramid
[10:06:46] pappej: Is there any civil engineers giving their takes on this? Would be interesting to hear
[10:06:57] Desriq__: Cleopatra was black
[10:06:58] JasonMunday: John Wayne Gay Seed
[10:07:00] pappej: I still don't find it that unbelievable
[10:07:07] Vunoka: Some say that the Ancient Godess Lizzo did the canonball and off the wave she created they surfed all the granite into the pyramids
[10:07:07] Piorum_: How they built the pyramids is actually quite simple, however we are not ready to understand yet
[10:07:15] Vtal: There were ancient Mages called Magi

[10:10:02] Piorum_: The pyramids were built closer in time to now than the sphinx
[10:10:06] coolcrazyguy72: if bob lazar was telling the truth about the sports model being found in an archeological dig ancient Egyptians might have found a ufo to build the pyramids

[10:11:36] gogol_sm: TheIlluminati
[10:11:37] Cley145: YEP
[10:11:38] Vindicti: The out of Africa theory is just subversion
[10:11:44] pappej: The religious adherence to the out-of-Africa theory just shows that there is no interest to discovering our history
[10:11:45] clozer_kek: we're all red&white on the inside
[10:11:52] OrganikCum: lol cock
[10:11:56] Genghjs: The people who control the system ofc

[10:12:53] ArtiiBoii: yes
[10:12:54] crazee76: I get the feeling that people misunderstood the +50% exp buff, it is only for people starting out and will go from 1-25 the buff is not for people 25-40, this is why they are doing exp in BFD and the turn ins for the boxes which stops at 39..
[10:12:56] Vunoka: Thats it, im packing my bags, im going to Antartica
[10:12:56] osopolar1977: you can’t go Antartica
[10:13:02] 21Khal: guzuSUS ?

[10:13:10] Muaytitus: not an alien guy, just a hyperborrean
[10:13:15] re5onxnce: I like the Admiral Byrd story
[10:13:17] AlphaSimply: theres always photos of giant creatures, scientist had labs there, (that are abandoned now) they used to do test on things. (supposedly)
[10:13:20] Vunoka: What if I do it without their permission
[10:13:21] Pwinzor: you need to be accepted to go there too its a whole process
[10:13:22] Gealls: no human would be able to keep his mouth shut if there was smthing like that there
[10:13:22] IR_ish: what are they gonna do? arrest me?
[10:13:23] Vunoka: ??
[10:13:24] AlphaSimply: already*
[10:13:29] IR_ish: just start a war on them
[10:13:30] adamg46: who controlled Antarctica?
[10:13:30] story_writer_rent: the war didnt end after hitler died. they say the nazis had their real shit in Antarctica
[10:13:34] fart_boiii: they dont want you to see the edge

[10:15:04] fart_boiii: we live in a dome like the simpsons predicted
[10:15:23] fart_boiii: the simpsons know everything
[10:15:43] b0ndl: I thought it's commonly accepted therory that there were 4 groups of humans evolving pretty much at the same time. for example blue eyes are exclusively one specific line
[10:15:46] eshonxv: people seethe at the idea that ancient humans might have been smarter than they are
[10:15:47] fuguelah: Ancient ruins in Antarctica supports Earth dynamo flip theory. Which is scary af.
[10:15:50] The_Loony_Bin: look at the sumerian king list, those guys were ancient
[10:15:53] Mawshaw: peepoSitWizard Earthen, arise
[10:16:01] AlphaSimply: Ask the Catholic, they have the hidden scrolls of history
[10:16:07] pappej: Don't you think many of the Hyperborean myths just come from the fact that the indo-european migrations came from the northern steppes? Migration into America from the north, into India from the north etc.
[10:16:11] PazokiTV: says online you can go to Antarctica and thousands of people do a year. countries just signed a treaty to say no military presence is allowed there
[10:16:13] Vtal: What ancient findings would you find in antartica?
[10:16:14] Genghjs: @abruptdecayo_o yes it is allowed to stay near the shores but you're not allowed to freely explore Antarctica look it up man Antarctic treaty
[10:16:18] b0ndl: yeah 4 groups
[10:16:18] Vunoka: Because the global elite wants us to mix and ruin the western race to create a lot of sub 120 iq individuals who are easily controlled
[10:16:22] glorymcho: Aliens man, everybody knows it!
[10:16:40] clozer_kek: 144k dna strands (were) our common thread
[10:16:42] zUg_zUg_: Atlantis
[10:17:02] Vunoka: Dont read what my mst
[10:17:04] Vunoka: !vanish
[10:17:06] adamg46: Yeah cause surely down that road your suggesting there are different species of humans
[10:17:06] story_writer_rent: why is it that every successful and advanced civilization built that empire from dehumanizing others. most modern tech was discovered/made by nazis. romans had slaves. egyptians had slaves.
[10:17:14] pholuszxy: @Mawshaw
[10:17:17] tsetse2fly: How do you explain that you have the same DNA to 99%+ as an african man? zulul
[10:17:17] berni2031: does anybody know in chat, we only get 225 profs on lvl 40, right?
[10:17:18] b0ndl: StaysafeTV I thought it's commonly accepted therory that there were 4 groups of humans evolving pretty much at the same time. for example blue eyes are exclusively one specific line
[10:17:21] Piorum_: @Mawshaw
[10:17:25] adamg46: not you specifically, just that line of thought
[10:17:25] Mawshaw: HUH
[10:17:30] aerodynam1c: @berni2031 yes
[10:17:40] fart_boiii: humans have civilized thousands of times before us under the great firmemented dome of that of which we live
[10:17:49] pappej: @tsetse2fly Now do monkeys

[10:18:17] Sharksleep: that happened with me, i have blue eyes but the rest of my family has brown eyes
[10:18:21] Frank4LuLz: blue eyes is the genetic abnormality
[10:18:22] AlphaSimply: i have blue, both parents are not blue eyed
[10:18:23] calybroon: if the recessive gene is carried through yes thats possible
[10:18:24] kalsizzle2: my parents are both brown eyes dark hair and im blue eyes blonde

[10:18:29] tsetse2fly: Epic rare elite blue eyed spawn child
[10:18:29] Vtal: Its the recessive gene
[10:18:30] PazokiTV: blue eyes are a mutation, not an inherent trait
[10:18:31] Vunoka: Both parents have to have the blue genetic trait for that to happen
[10:18:42] coolcrazyguy72: eye colour is just a chemical imbalance. you can change it with drugs
[10:18:42] trinity_at: cause you have 2 eye colours, one isn’t visible and your secondary eye colour
[10:18:50] Genghjs: Some are born blue but turn brown after first years
[10:18:52] story_writer_rent: the secret to the advancement of the human race might be cruelty
[10:18:55] zUg_zUg_: mutants
[10:18:58] fuguelah: If there are ruins in Antarctica we are talking about millions of years of continental shift... Unless the earth flips like a dynamo cyclicly, causing massive floods.
[10:18:58] clozer_kek: Mitochondrial
[10:19:03] Sawfthandz: On both sides, we each had siblings with blue eyes as well, her sister, my brother.
[10:19:11] b0ndl: true

[10:42:42] Boosticuff: spitting facts rn
[10:42:51] oilerr: Do you think it will make sense to have 40 waylaid supply boxes ready for the next phase? @StaysafeTV
[10:43:38] aparssss: @StaysafeTV they said they will inscrease XP bro
[10:43:41] oilerr: I thought they said they'd increase the xp gain
[10:43:44] Denz0TV: That is also 40 inventory slots
[10:43:44] aparssss: they gonna worth more
[10:43:49] ZIMdb_: i thought it was 1200?
[10:43:54] Denz0TV: only 24-40 boxes are
[10:43:58] Denz0TV: 25%
[10:43:58] oilerr: oooh i see

[10:44:11] aBradAbroad: ahhh
[10:44:13] aBradAbroad: i didnt know that
[10:44:16] bots_bots: they didnt say they werent either but it seems unlikely
[10:44:37] Wrettchh: EZ
[10:44:41] TesservcT: no enough bank space
[10:44:50] TesservcT: not*
[10:44:52] Denz0TV: No where near enough inventory space for that shit lol
[10:45:12] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: will they still give some reputation? @StaysafeTV
[10:45:19] aerodynam1c: imagine the sleeping bag is from supply rep
[10:45:23] sargent_baddy: farm gold
[10:45:26] HEIZALL: :)
[10:45:42] Denz0TV: You're better off farming 18x  WSG marks
[10:45:43] Gjalarx: probably gonna add more stuff for rep
[10:47:09] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: nah its good
[10:47:13] sargent_baddy: 1200 exp for 3 marks way better
[10:47:14] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[10:47:22] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: its just like retail new patch, old items are basically useless there too
[10:47:28] justsmilin247: next phase is going to be hugeeeee
[10:47:34] Denz0TV: I dislike that they didn't specify the exact amount BFD will give XP wise
[10:47:41] somebdk: if they do it they should do it without announcing it. :D
[10:48:01] PippTheKid: think they said they were deleting those
[10:48:04] Syrlia: mailbox will be purged
[10:48:06] oilerr: naah they said they will change it @StaysafeTV so u cant get mails
[10:48:06] 1Head_KFC_MANAGER: they were deleting that
[10:48:12] Kden1: how many can you have in your inventory?
[10:48:14] mrhood71: i thought they annouce deleting them
[10:48:22] Gjalarx: u can have 20
[10:48:35] bluntsamurai98: @oilerr where'd they say that?
[10:48:41] bluntsamurai98: actually curious no hate
[10:48:51] sargent_baddy: should be able to farm them on the 7th
[10:48:58] sargent_baddy: if not oh well i guess
[10:49:18] bots_bots: they said they would purge mail during maintenance on the 7th i think that means that night
[10:49:21] bots_bots: right before p2 patch
[10:49:26] itsdynabro: maxqt is such a cringe name
[10:49:52] sargent_baddy: @bots_bots makes sense
[10:50:10] Denz0TV: @StaysafeTV Did they say how much xp BFD will give?
[10:50:36] believedbiscuit: they said they're purging it on maintenance so you still would have time to farm them after
[10:50:38] oilerr: My guess is 50% of a level
[10:50:40] tsetse2fly: I'd guess around a level
[10:50:57] WestiiaK: and if you're 10 man or 8
[10:50:57] fivenu: 3 Day lockout on BFD still, it should give atleast 1 lvl of XP every clear, whatever lvl u are
[10:51:08] bots_bots: if u arent full bis its worth regardless of scaling
[10:51:13] aerodynam1c: my guild is logging out at bfd > hillsbrad turn ins > tb summ > ct > 1k needles > rfk
[10:51:14] DRONJET: are they fixing rogue combo stacking?
[10:51:35] gary_ontwitch: thats only true if it scales faster than the xp you can get frmo quests and mobs
[10:51:40] jallaballan: it will be a sizeable amount upon completetion
[10:51:56] G14__Classified: sup dude
[10:52:06] Denz0TV: You think it will be faster than handing in quest stack into spellcleave dungeon spam?
[10:52:17] 冂凵乃口: so i can't send all consumes and cloth from my alt before phase start?
[10:52:18] iscamog: @StaysafeTV can I post links? I wanted your take on something
[10:52:28] iscamog: https://youtu.be/d4vHegf3WPU
[10:52:32] Vunoka: How is lmgd going to recover from no SoD beta? Is he okay? First time he is doing content he hasnt done 50x times over already D:
[10:52:37] iscamog: prob old news but only just saw it
[10:52:38] Seoken1: the only hard limiting factor is lockout 1, which is Feb 13th. So my thought is be ready on as many characters for lockout 1 as possible, everything else is optional
[10:53:04] pizzagubben1: @iscamog KEKInsane
[10:53:12] Wesqt1: @冂凵乃口 only wsg marks are getting purged
[10:53:24] stevsal89: gum?

[10:54:21] Seoken1: yeah I think most guild groups are planning on running February 12th for that reason, or even the AM of the 13th LUL
[10:54:28] tsetse2fly: The raid gonna be hard for world first people trying to figure out the mechanics
[10:54:31] Seoken1: gives them as much time as possible to farm
[10:54:39] stevsal89: when a getting more gum
[10:55:23] pappej: Sadge
[10:55:37] Bolbaron: why would it be that bad to not full clear on 1st reset
[10:55:48] Bolbaron: I'll be glad to even step in there 1st reset
[10:55:57] aerodynam1c: where do i buy incendrites
[10:56:07] stevsal89: sweeeeet I’ll stay tuned
[10:57:09] bots_bots: u dont get the xp if u dont full clear right? they said the xp comes at the end

[11:34:59] cafrozed: they had him dead to rights and just let him go

[11:35:07] KtgWar: Liberals are the only people who call the swat on people

[11:41:02] coiozzz: @vunoka I do that but still feels like it's not enough. I hike every weekend (not alone), go to theatre etc
[11:41:10] PippTheKid: mine does on 25 shaman but its a custom profile i didnt make @Marlye213
[11:41:43] StreetBlades: you can edit it with the quests you have and it will add which ever values you put in
[11:41:57] perseay797: Is SoD giving you what you were hoping for? @StaysafeTV
[11:42:02] coiozzz: @Mind_G0bl1n I have no problem coping with it. Whatever's thrown my way I will deal with it one way or another. It's just that I strongly feel like this isn't how life is supposed to go
[11:42:06] StreetBlades: it was 1550 at 25
[11:42:10] StreetBlades: 20#
[11:42:20] Marlye213: @PippTheKid it only shows fileed bar for me, when i mouseover it nothing appears, so idk

[11:42:36] StreetBlades: for the lvl you are
[11:43:09] PippTheKid: @Marlye213 gotta be a setting for it somewhere
[11:43:12] StreetBlades: Ah ok. Didn't know. Sorry

[11:43:31] weaxofc: dont forgett to pret silk :D or mabye you wait with that trun in to 50 phase ?
[11:44:04] coiozzz: @Mind_G0bl1n Eh, I don't think that's the case (Romanian here btw). What ruined the economy is consumerism and the never ending chase for economic growth
[11:44:17] IR_ish: number go up good
[11:44:25] NutterCircus: Its like watching the lvls go up live! EleGiggle
[11:44:44] coiozzz: @coiozzz add to that people's obsession with wealth and status, consumerism etc
[11:44:45] Mind_G0bl1n: @coiozzz yeah hence biden getting us into all sorts of wars
[11:44:58] MrPink604: just type the name once and copy it into the search bar?
[11:45:10] OrganikCum: yea biden is doing great, as long as you ignore the prices of everything and all the wars and the lack of leadship
[11:45:34] coiozzz: Do you guys really think one person, Biden in this case, has that much influence? Let's be honest
[11:45:42] OrganikCum: he is the president. yes.
[11:45:50] coiozzz: it would've been shit no matter who was the president
[11:46:16] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Hello
[11:46:22] coiozzz: this is the result of a decade of low to 0 interest loans for businesses
[11:46:47] bots_bots: do you think any current president has more influence today than any dead person has today?
[11:46:52] christiangodwarrior97: its more expensive everywhere i dont think trump would have whipped out exodia and solved it
[11:46:53] Mind_G0bl1n: @coiozzz not to mention the constant bailouts most recently of the private banks
[11:46:56] coiozzz: as well as too many people living beyond their means
[11:47:01] tsetse2fly: gm peepoHappy @basedschizo44
[11:47:07] IR_ish: that is almost a level already!
[11:47:08] Nightbot: COVERING THE HUGE SOD PHASE 2 NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kNXGec_1k
[11:47:19] coiozzz: @Mind_G0bl1n those banks needed bailouts exactly because of bad loans
[11:47:39] perseay797: Will you rock affli or destro in p2?
[11:47:42] Mind_G0bl1n: @coiozzz they should let them fail like true capitalism intended
[11:47:50] coiozzz: @christiangodwarrior97 exactly. It has fuck all to do with whoever the US president is
[11:48:03] coiozzz: @Mind_G0bl1n there was never such a thing as true capitalism
[11:48:04] Mind_G0bl1n: people/banks who get overlevereged should be allowed to get rekt
[11:48:30] Githany: Warlock Tank is going to be unhinged with Hellfire and pushback protection.
[11:48:47] Mind_G0bl1n: but no we refuse and rather fight 2 world wars at once to keep the bad banks running
[11:48:53] TheSanguist: Isn't it like 2k exp for turning in the Ashenvale PVP event item as well?
[11:48:56] coiozzz: there are countless billion dollar businesses who never made a cent of profit...explain that
[11:49:33] IR_ish: i want real banks back, that hold an item for safe keeping until you want it back... then charge you for it.
[11:49:35] TheDastardlyD: you have the letter
[11:49:36] perseay797: Just kill 1 mob :)
[11:49:39] TheDastardlyD: that you didn't start
[11:49:42] MrPink604: a single box
[11:49:46] weaxofc: mate you can turn in Silk and prep wsg marks ?
[11:49:46] NutterCircus: The two quests in bags
[11:49:47] IR_ish: don't want them to gamble with my money
[11:49:50] Mind_G0bl1n: just discover a zone for the xp
[11:49:58] coiozzz: @Mind_G0bl1n at the end of the day, I still believe the ordinary Joe is to blame because all these issues are cultural at their core imo
[11:50:01] JayBravoTV: don’t forget silk and wool turn in, that’s juicy
[11:50:03] perseay797: UWUtanka AYAYA

[11:50:50] Vicente_Prime: i thought you weren accumulating quests man
[11:50:55] Yeahmate: silk/wool handins
[11:51:09] coiozzz: @Mind_G0bl1n it's the people who think life is about accumulation of wealth and being "better" than their neighbours
[11:51:11] VeZzE666: Why not just do next part of blood shards
[11:51:15] Marlye213: assasination plot ha folloup
[11:51:22] trizinwow: trizinwow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hi :)
[11:51:29] TweakT: it aint? @coiozzz
[11:51:32] divadnothsa: Did you do wool donation?
[11:51:41] Yeahmate: @StaysafeTV silk/wool handins

[11:52:25] bots_bots: when u go to SM
[11:52:29] bots_bots: you can do org
[11:52:44] boinky27: if you turn in blood shards now you can get the nak lok kuz skull quest, as well as the weapons. quest, which you can just keep the items, and the lok skull is a 2fer as you have to go to crossroads after.
[11:52:47] coconutenjoyer: !video

[11:53:12] bots_bots: silk is like 1600 i think
[11:53:15] z1p022: what is the strat once you turn in all qs? Dungon grind or more quests?
[11:53:21] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: buy weapons of choice on the AH
[11:53:22] speedzombie: Silk so expensive
[11:53:24] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  your looking at classic value isnt it based off SoM values?
[11:53:27] TweakT: u gotta accumulate 60-70% of house price wealth so u dont need to take a slave owner’s loan for 40 years @coiozzz
[11:53:47] boinky27: @staysafetv if you turn in blood shards now you can get the nak lok kuz skull quest, as well as the weapons. quest, which you can just keep the items, and the lok skull is a 2fer as you have to go to crossroads after.
[11:53:49] IR_ish: ye, just park it there and then hearth to where you want to go LUL
[11:53:56] Mind_G0bl1n: @coiozzz i wouldnt mind if it was pure capitalism, the system is too rigged currently and looks more like imperialism
[11:54:21] Mind_G0bl1n: thats why i rather not think about it and just milk it while playing games
[11:54:36] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: weapons of choice quest, you can buy them on the AH prolly
[11:54:45] coiozzz: @TweakT and why do you think owning a home is so expensive? could it maybe be because of those who hoard homes and come up with stupid regulations so their homes keep their high prices?
[11:55:01] coiozzz: @Mind_G0bl1n to me it looks like feudalism
[11:55:09] chogie1: Can have items i bag/bank on wep of choice
[11:55:19] boinky27: he’s the guy by the smith
[11:55:20] VeZzE666: You did that before A New ore sample
[11:55:27] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: sadge
[11:55:30] 冂凵乃口: @weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu its bop, but you can loot it without quest
[11:55:53] perseay797: This dragonflight trailer being shoved down your throat LUL
[11:55:59] staxx23: has anyone had the issue where they cant play classic because it says "sub expired" but you can login on retail?
[11:56:07] VeZzE666: But it opens a give in in crossroads after it that is huge exp
[11:56:10] Lawdito007: it do
[11:56:15] boinky27: @staysafetv it chains into another quest instantly to crossroads
[11:56:18] boinky27: ahh nvm
[11:56:41] Phatshot3: Can you pre collect the items now with out turning in first part of chain?
[11:56:42] VeZzE666: Where do you start then?
[11:56:43] TweakT: its expensive because interest rates were low for a time, people took out huge loans and interest rates went up when pandemic hit because gov took out even more loans and supply/demand is the reault we have today so only thing to do right now is to save money @coiozzz
[11:57:01] 冂凵乃口: that quest in crossroads give 3k
[11:57:03] weaxofc: you can aslo store wsg token in mailbox
[11:57:10] Wesqt1: @weaxofc false
[11:57:16] Vicente_Prime: broo
[11:57:16] Jay_rb: In game
[11:57:19] weaxofc: 1 day before
[11:57:19] Vicente_Prime: don't kill urself
[11:57:24] VeZzE666: Then you will fly over crossroads to Stonetalon
[11:57:29] weaxofc: they are in mailbox 24 H mate
[11:57:36] chogie1: spirit res is at the elevator
[11:57:37] perseay797: You can store up to 20 wsg marks and turn them in on 25. Each turn is is about 1k exp
[11:57:38] Wesqt1: they are purging mailbox, mat.
[11:57:40] Wesqt1: mate*
[11:57:44] gary_ontwitch: @TweakT home prices were out of whack long before interest rates went up, there's been significant undersupply since before the GFC
[11:57:53] weaxofc: we talking
[11:57:54] Wesqt1: talking to a guy in chat
[11:57:57] weaxofc: about wsg token
[11:58:01] the_dorner: the_dorner subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Finished genealogy of morals and most of revolt against the modern world last month. Don't agree with every part but they were extremely motivating. Millions must try.
[11:58:03] Wesqt1: <3
[11:58:05] Mind_G0bl1n: @TweakT then we got into one war and then another and took more loans and when the banks started failing the fed took on more loans
[11:58:06] coiozzz: @TweakT they were expensive even before, but not THAT expensive. The demand is inflated by the hoarders and the supply can't keep up because of regulations
[11:58:07] weaxofc: yeah adn 24 h before you can store 18 more
[11:58:12] weaxofc: yes you can
[11:58:13] mrtomtishh: cant u get wsg in mailbox last 24 hours
[11:58:14] weaxofc: 24 h before
[11:58:18] IR_ish: gotta go fast if you wanna get your kill quests done before everyone else
[11:58:22] zobolebay: are you gonna have day before release marks in your mailbox? they last 24h
[11:58:22] weaxofc: day before p2 you can
[11:58:23] weaxofc: so
[11:58:25] IR_ish: otherwise you're going to share mobs Kappa
[11:58:26] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  its 60 of each cloth type per turn in right
[11:58:42] Seoken1: no way

[12:41:46] xAcaelus: whats the logout skips addon called sstvWAT
[12:41:46] gary_ontwitch: LOL yeah its nuts
[12:41:54] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  This addon is experimental; don't rely on the logout skip locations too much. To use this addon, open the map and click the Show LogoutSkips button. Red x's are locations where the logout skips will teleport you to. The red lines are Voronoi partitions which act as boundaries between different logout skip teleport locations. The idea is that if you perform a logout skip, you will be teleported to the location indicated by the x that is within the polygon that you are in.
[12:41:55] Arcsilin: what is that?
[12:42:08] GuggenX: That addon is not accurate btw
[12:42:28] TheFubz: i need this addon

[12:44:40] kodiak_1: is this some triangle theory shit again like phase 1?

[12:48:34] limburgse: the buffs arent working anymore at 39 so i think you’ll get xp from it, im not sure what they gonna do with the WSG tokens with launch p2, i heard that they gonna reset them. but that can be a rumor 🙃
[12:48:35] Phatshot3: you can collect the pages and save a quest slot
[12:48:47] xAcaelus: why wouldnt you utilize your hearth though

[12:49:28] ItHatWhat: there isnt any unless you left the animals
[12:49:31] Kebabra_: Have you done all the rare mobs?
[12:50:01] limburgse: @chatgpttwitchbot ah oke
[12:50:25] perseay797: King of the Foulweald is actually done closer to Splintertree. You do it, go to Splinter, fly to Zoram to turn in.
[12:51:16] ensn97: how long you expecting 25-40 take in /played?
[12:51:33] warsoul_: if you fly up left then fly down
[12:51:41] ensn97: grouping in dungeons all way?
[12:51:52] perseay797: So about 2hours per lvl. That's fast.
[12:51:53] ensn97: wondering for my group of 3 warrs, feral and priest
[12:51:56] ensn97: ohh solo

[12:52:31] limburgse: the outside questworld will be cursed the first 2 weeks, every mob will be hypercamped. 25/40 zone will be perished every 2 minutes 🙈
[12:52:33] IronCartographer: isn't there an exp bonus from grouping that makes it worthwhile?
[12:52:56] Henariii: Henariii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! yooo Faze 2 goin to be dope
[12:52:57] Krabue: @StaysafeTV what dungeon 1st?

[12:54:27] StreetBlades: I just tried to click off the wowhead add off your stream. I'm so fried :D
[12:54:31] einself111: @Fluffshock novaworldbuffs
[12:54:35] Fluffshock: ty
[12:54:43] perseay797: Holy shit this min maxing
[12:54:46] IronCartographer: @xAcaelus They said completing the raid gave exp so it might not be worth cutting down from 10man if it's per-raid rather than per-mob
[12:54:58] perseay797: So you plan to do 30 hours stream and then go to bed? Bedge
[12:55:19] osopolar1977: I’ll be 2 weeks behind
[12:55:52] xAcaelus: @IronCartographer regardless our xp bar will be back and lowering the amount of people in the raid mobs will give xp regardless
[12:56:21] Phatshot3: your other quest can be assassination plot in 1k, it will also open a follow up in the same camp
