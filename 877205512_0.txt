[1:07:52] alextheory_: Huntsman Mythic i assume! But hard to know
[1:08:02] Thunderbrew: So Sloot GQuit or they disbanded the guild?
[1:08:03] D3mitr1: but I guess all good things come to an end

[1:09:13] kacchan_bo: some stupid right of first refusal
[1:09:14] Thunderbrew: Like you said, probably better for Sloot to just Tank for someone and not be a Guild Master
[1:09:14] Artivicii: definitely sensed the frustrations during his mythic prog streams
[1:09:19] danimoto10: seems like some raiders wanted to compete WF at some point
[1:09:23] Vigi9413: finally got that elusive Sire kill
[1:09:28] Molvonos: I know he was getting tired of guildies bitching about not wanting to do progressive content, like farming stygia for sockets n' stuff.
[1:09:32] Jay_rb: Mythic's only been out 4 weeks right?
[1:09:33] Veegore: Tegu posted a long tweet about it

[1:13:07] Kromede: DH > tank
[1:13:36] D3mitr1: I have no doubt sloot would find a good guild
[1:13:37] Brandonhipster: They should called M+ DH+
[1:13:50] Gruffian: you should

[1:16:21] D3mitr1: that wouldn't be a bad match tbh
[1:16:34] Truedusk: Truedusk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 85 months, currently on a 85 month streak! 
[1:16:47] MOLAR305: if sloot wants to really relax, he will convert to dps
[1:16:57] Vigi9413: sloot wouldn't be satisfied in Shade, no offense
[1:16:58] D3mitr1: he loves tanking tho
[1:17:15] Vorog1: I saw DJ’s are kinda casual now
[1:17:17] Thunderbrew: Sloot could heal?
[1:17:18] MOLAR305: yea but that is how one goes on a real breain vacation
[1:17:26] MOLAR305: brain*
[1:17:31] D3mitr1: yeah
[1:17:39] D3mitr1: unless max recruits sloot
[1:17:44] D3mitr1: that would be pog
[1:17:48] smokingcactus: I think tanking is very relaxing.
[1:17:51] D3mitr1: then darkee goes dps
[1:17:53] Cetraben: Most tanks would rather DPS than Tank, as Tanking is pretty unrewarding. It's pass/fail, nothing really more.
[1:18:07] ohnot___her: Do you think Sloot wants to go WF?
[1:18:10] ahies28: You never know Sloot may very well want to raid and play with IRL friends
[1:18:17] smokingcactus: I'd rather tank idc if rewarding or not
[1:18:25] mitchr2812: Did you see that the affix is explosion? Also for you?
[1:18:28] jimmwayne: sloo to echo meeres agian dd
[1:18:40] WoW_StandalonE: DH always dead lol
[1:18:45] D3mitr1: tbh anyone would recruit sloot
[1:18:45] on_sale_menswear: Your mage is bad
[1:19:12] D3mitr1: dude just has tonns of experience
[1:19:14] ThatGuyFayde: weird considering how much CC that group has
[1:19:16] Cosmolus: idk how nobody insta ccs the bladestorm
[1:19:34] Tinit5190: I do most of them as guard druid. One moonfire lel
[1:19:44] shifferbrains562: @Towelliee Any tips on Blood? Proper CD usage before pulls in M+?
[1:19:47] thebakeriscomingforu: in my experience pugs don't interrupt.
[1:20:04] thebakeriscomingforu: Why I use the holy sigil lego on my prot pally
[1:20:38] lumaday: @shifferbrains562 great guides on wowhead
[1:20:41] northcub: your elitist views are completely out of touch with the vast majority of the Warcraft community, you need to take a break most of us are just not as skilled as you
[1:21:02] Brandonhipster: ???? Northcub
[1:21:05] Molvonos: @northcub lol
[1:21:12] 911Viking: @northcub i mean hes doing #14.. not exactly casual content
[1:21:42] shifferbrains562: @lumaday I've read those and Icy Veins. All they recc is using Rune Tap before and hope I don't get crushed.
[1:21:50] MrGattz: thats exactly what an elitest would say
[1:21:54] puppythrower: @911Viking 14 is casual content..
[1:22:08] 911Viking: i guess im super casual
[1:22:19] brain_wash: Towellie comes off as elitist to people?!?!?!?!? BWWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[1:22:24] brain_wash: Ha
[1:22:28] shutyourface: or reroll vengence demon hunter
[1:22:44] thebakeriscomingforu: to be fair dungeons just hit hard, its partly why the most mobile tanks are doing well right now. kit
[1:22:47] thebakeriscomingforu: kite*
[1:22:57] Thunderbrew: Towelliee is not Elitist. He's a nice guy.

[1:23:37] Molvonos: There's a difference between being Elitest and having common sense. Some tanks are in bad places, Blood DK is one of them. Prot Warrior is one of them. Calling them bad isn't 'elitest'
[1:24:07] AMutatedWaffle: Prot warriors aren't bad raid wise
[1:24:10] Affiiance: Prot Warriors were in RWF, think they are ok
[1:24:49] AgentWhiskeyy: i mean prot warrior was used for limit

[1:24:59] AgentWhiskeyy: for all raid
[1:25:08] cheersfordoobies: all the top tier blood dks ask why people play blood dks, lmaoo
[1:25:15] shutyourface: rallying cry
[1:25:17] AgentWhiskeyy: true like brewmaster
[1:25:21] Vigi9413: They used a prot warrior because arms is terrible
[1:25:21] Gruffian: Prot warrior had some reflect things that were nerfed too.
[1:25:22] BaldBroGaming: We have a blood DK in our raid, I am constantly having to use Blessing of Sacrifice on him
[1:25:24] Vigi9413: and they wanted the rally
[1:25:28] Molvonos: Pretty niche reasons.
[1:25:28] AgentWhiskeyy: but warrior does take less physical damage
[1:25:39] ThisTHC: warriors are squishy as fuck
[1:25:39] wildheittv: They specifically had the Prot for Rally and last 3 bosses. nothing else
[1:25:43] Molvonos: Doesnt make them viable compared to others (Looking at you, VDH)
[1:25:44] esceti95: yh i wish they were good my fav tank to play
[1:25:48] Affiiance: I mean if the class can Tank Sire at the Cutting Edge level I would say its fine
[1:25:51] jerexify: Blood DK is fine for our Heroic raiding team. :D :D
[1:25:52] brain_wash: Old new now, but anybody else watch Max in that heroic raid this weekend with some random guild, hilarious
[1:26:04] PlayKn1ght: idk, i play blood dk and so far my experience is that i live long after my party dies to mechanics
[1:26:22] noxitall: LevelupKent has been playing blood dk in the wow channel
[1:26:24] D3mitr1: healers hate bdks tho
[1:26:27] Endy253: My problem isnt my Blood DK but the fact that I never get Vers gear.
[1:26:30] ThisTHC: @affiiance played by a cutting edge player yes
[1:26:33] GermanBacon: GermanBacon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 88 months! 
[1:26:35] PlayKn1ght: my healer loves blood dks
[1:26:44] ThisTHC: @affiiance a world first player *
[1:26:45] D3mitr1: to spikey
[1:27:02] Daggerstry: It is officially W-2 season
[1:27:17] Affiiance: Yeah, its gonna be fine in you Heroic Raid @ThisTHC even if not played perfectly
[1:28:03] FresheFefe: they need to change pve loot, it's so frustrating
[1:28:07] ThisTHC: its not though thats the problem lol. I run with dh prot war and the difference between the 2 is massive
[1:28:34] lumaday: Which lego are you using in M+ these days @Towelliee ?
[1:28:47] epiczplz: so happy i choose to play VDH and monk this expansion
[1:29:27] shutyourface: not gonna be any DH in progression if they do that lmao
[1:29:28] SlayerLightStorm: Drop rates need to be buffed, seriously.
[1:30:03] Slafer383: the thinkg is faire brand is not only OP thing, its just the class overall now. like all the shit
[1:30:04] ShinyLox: So what are you maining right now?
[1:30:18] Thunderbrew: I'm glad I'm a scrub and can still play my Prot Paladin
[1:30:29] Affiiance: Have you guys not learned yet? Every expansion theres a best tank that holds the title for most of the expansion
[1:30:43] daniel85mg: lol
[1:30:43] thebakeriscomingforu: when prot paladin went from a charge system back to holy power it messed with how often we could use shield of the righteous.
[1:31:01] Aro725: Yeah i think slooty could use some drinks for sure. Hope hes doing alright
[1:31:01] PlayKn1ght: yeah and there's always a few players that manage to be skilled at the class that make it in the leaderboards
[1:31:37] northcub: DH just came out yesterday, they havnt waited for anything
[1:31:37] shutyourface: havoc is so bad
[1:31:42] shutyourface: but still tons of fun
[1:31:57] MOLAR305: @northcub the king of hot takes today
[1:32:05] AMutatedWaffle: @northcub they were shit the expac they came out, and shit for all but the last tier in bfa lmao
[1:32:06] kekwnano: I feel like Bremaster is slept on
[1:32:11] Thunderbrew: Millie drives me nuts by saying this will drive you nuts
[1:32:16] Dannubb: @Towelliee whats the best covenant for Brewmaster
[1:32:18] ThisTHC: At least the can still pvp. just need to use their night fae ability
[1:32:23] ThisTHC: they*
[1:32:28] Daggerstry: You just give the boss the crystal of course
[1:32:48] Uutef: its the Z
[1:32:51] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: ye the laser from Millie to stun millhouse
[1:32:52] DelamTTL: the lazer that stuns boss
[1:32:55] DelamTTL: stuns you too
[1:32:57] pilhass10: seems like you don't know the mechanics in that boss aswell LUL
[1:32:59] jerexify: @Towelliee I noticed that they changed the debuff from Greater Greedstone in Revendreth that wouldn't let you mount to a buff, now, so you can just click it off.
[1:33:02] TheNumber35: Stun comes from the laser towel, just walk out of the laser path
[1:33:03] DelamTTL: same with shadowfury for the chicken doom
[1:33:10] Vinnie__C: tank life just pay it offf
[1:33:35] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I healed that through on my 11 today
[1:33:50] DelamTTL: you cant burst either boss down before they each phase
[1:33:54] pilhass10: not a bug if you do too much dps it just phases and fucks it up
[1:34:05] DelamTTL: like if you lust right away and burn millhouse down it scuffs the millificient phase
[1:34:29] TheNumber35: If you kill Millhouse before the phase change, he won’t use shadowfury in her phase
[1:34:47] MourvinMad: i am panic mode healer. it me
[1:34:55] ShinyLox: LOL Ive been there
[1:35:00] daniel85mg: early expac makes healers all panic

[1:35:33] blazeofhell: well, as a holy paly, when people stand in bad stuff, even two WoG do not save them(
[1:35:43] thebakeriscomingforu: in a twist Kyrian seems to be covenant pick for most tanks
[1:35:43] Raffah_: today I had to heal the tank as ret pally on first boss of halls, healer was out of circle LUL
[1:35:52] northcub: it is extremely BM for tanks and dps to side heal, you need to trust your group
[1:36:02] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Least I can expect my Gfuel order is Wednesday, I think.
[1:36:08] Molvonos: @northcub You're trying to hard to troll homie

[1:41:02] MechNL: surely with combustion
[1:41:10] northcub: lastnight I watched Max from Limit raid lead Heroic CN for 4 hours,at no point was he as critical of his members wiping the raid as you are critical of pugs in a mythic+ not using shackle and sooth
[1:41:14] board4life65: the mage should be able to save combust for add
[1:41:14] nemesis981: just have him save combust for it
[1:41:16] MOLAR305: @Lockrocker he might have had some had that whole jailtime thing not happened

[1:43:03] Stahlram: it is most definitely Jack Bauer
[1:43:18] RakwaXD: I miss that show with the cell phones that had the magic batteries.
[1:43:23] N3llee: 24 WAS GRREAT
[1:43:26] MOLAR305: 24 wasthe shit
[1:43:42] SlayerLightStorm: 24 was one of the best shows. I absolutely LOVED it. BOAT in my books.
[1:43:56] AgentWhiskeyy: that 24 countdown at the end to hit their commecials
[1:43:57] AgentWhiskeyy: iconic
[1:44:00] MOLAR305: @northcub did you notice during RWF max telling people not to pull a THD, its passive agressive criticism
[1:44:19] warrenny: Shames hes in prison
[1:44:21] MOLAR305: @northcub perspective, do you have it?
[1:44:24] gidgeet: I've been watching Kim's Convenience on Netflix cute sitcom
[1:44:30] Aro725: hes holding combustion way too long, with kindling he should get it back every min so no use to save it
[1:44:34] thebakeriscomingforu: is it a frost, arcane, or fire mage?
[1:44:36] rohdey: wait 2k TOTAL dmg? or 2k DPS?
[1:44:51] MOLAR305: frost
[1:44:53] board4life65: his not using combust on adds
[1:45:28] SlayerLightStorm: towLul I don't even see what Northcub is saying because I have him blocked. Suck it, nerd. towLul
[1:45:29] ImSharpee: its 1 min cd
[1:45:30] buffility: he should use it more
[1:45:30] DannyG757: with nf its like every minute
[1:45:34] DelamTTL: timing it for good usage is rough
[1:45:34] Aro725: with kindling you get it to like 1 min
[1:45:36] ImSharpee: with kindling and shifting power
[1:45:36] Aeylid: i mean its like a 1:15 CD with covenant and stuff
[1:45:36] epiczplz: not even if you talent kindling its like 1 min
[1:45:38] DelamTTL: if you're not confident
[1:45:41] AyeitzDenny: its less eith the nightfae ability
[1:45:43] DelamTTL: but yeah with kindling its up alot
[1:45:44] MrGattz: its a 2 min cd that shortens every time you crit iirc
[1:45:59] TheNumber35: You should be using combust on like every other pack as a fire mage with NF cov
[1:46:34] board4life65: 2min + kingling talent= 1 min cd combust
[1:47:06] ChroniC_ZA: Tyriancal makes that boss alot harder with that dot
[1:47:08] twistedstick1: That DH looks a bit weak.

[1:58:30] manis_tv: real sweet
[1:58:32] Affiiance: Its over on Youtube, and it had pretty decent viewership yesterday
[1:58:41] NickTheFridge: @KingSpud91 true. theyre not good tanks without that i dont think. hopefully a buff to armor or general tankiness comes with a nerf to WoG!
[1:58:43] thebakeriscomingforu: Bear tanks are looking pretty good right now
[1:59:21] KingSpud91: @NickTheFridge agreed. Theres defo an issue with prot pala armor. Also compared to other tanks (such as DH) that can passively heal.. its kind of unfair xD
[1:59:43] rohdey: ToD is op for this boss and the Shattered's
[1:59:48] Affiiance: Prot Pallies are having their fun in Arenas right now
[1:59:50] rohdey: even as a MW
[2:00:10] NickTheFridge: @KingSpud91 Yea man the meta of always brining a DH is frustrating. Wish there was more tank diversity in higher keys :(
[2:00:21] SamDavidsin: this boss is a joke
[2:00:23] MrFuzzynuts420: https://clips.twitch.tv/VenomousColdbloodedSlothBIRB
[2:00:26] Affiiance: Prot Pallies are basically another healer in RBGs too
[2:00:50] KingSpud91: @NickTheFridge its just going to be DH for a while then blizz will probably buff warriors again and theyll be the Meta. Palas just get left behind like in BFA
[2:01:13] FrozenShades: @NickTheFridge I dont blame them, Vengenance Tank is just nuts right now.

[2:03:57] blazeofhell: it would be better if blizz added a vendor that instead of anime you would get currency for that shop. need anima - buy it, did like 20+ m+ get an item or upgrade

[2:04:09] RoxxusPlays: really hope they announce a badge vendor next patch

[2:06:01] Artivicii: True
[2:06:02] RoxxusPlays: As a fire mage, even when i try to pop combust for trash and bosses as much as i can, but i also tend to judge wrong when i should use it or not

[2:13:38] Stahlram: more people looking at Torghast as group content is what needs to happen
[2:13:38] thebakeriscomingforu: twisting corridors needs more reasons to go. Then add badge vendors for gear

[2:15:18] DannyG757: still bad
[2:15:24] indiegarona: I thought fire mages were the thing.
[2:15:35] jbeastb: well... it's tough to justify a frost mage when fire mages are so good
[2:15:38] Gargeth: Tried Frost again after this buff and still sucked.

[2:18:47] kokochris: there is no way they can make every class equal. its just not gonna happen.
[2:18:56] Plague_GG: Max said yesterday that raiding tank comp depends on how what tanks they use. Warriors and havocs were sub-par dps so they brought them as tanks.
[2:19:04] thebakeriscomingforu: some fights, affixes, etc will cater to some specs more
[2:19:06] mrniceguy817: That’s actually prob the best way they can do it so they don’t mess up current prog comps
[2:19:06] indiegarona: They've tried though. Back in the day, dps didn't have self healing.
[2:19:09] FrozenShades: Can we buff the spec's that have been dogshit forever? Survival Hunter?
[2:19:10] palthons: all three specs fpr mage are 100 dps within each other
[2:19:21] axxowow: thats how the elite stay in control :D
[2:19:40] indiegarona: Hey - I'd be on board with them making paladins and shamans faction specific again.
[2:19:56] lumaday: At least it changes periodically
[2:19:58] x614x_engineer: survival hunter actually isnt preforming that bad
[2:20:10] axxowow: that true too ;)
[2:20:29] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[2:20:34] thebakeriscomingforu: the elites will play whatever. they don't care about a given class. they just play what sims best in this given xpac and tier.
[2:20:40] sobralwilson: hi
[2:20:48] generaljosh721: 7? does towelliee know something we don't? Kappa
[2:21:04] kokochris: I went back to my affliction lock this expac. ya it worked out . I played fury in bfa, and man it was rough at times. so I fully feel peoples pain. they will continue to tune
[2:21:07] indiegarona: yeah...
[2:21:16] cheersfordoobies: was he a master...baiter
[2:21:17] MrFuzzynuts420: Not interested in playing vengeance? The rotation seems similar to prot pally
[2:21:18] jakobsurfs: i play casual and have 4 60s all 190+ and have never done above a +7
[2:21:24] tarot_with_tricia: Can someone explain to me why Athene is trying to look like Jesus lol
[2:21:50] warrenny: Played havoc in bfa now ret so fun
[2:21:53] thebakeriscomingforu: it is still the start of the xpac, as each patch comes out, things will be tuned
[2:21:55] The_PatientZero: Is he a BrM main now? Or is it just for the raiding?
[2:21:55] Veegore: i'd love to play brew i just can't get into it. i've tried so many times

[2:26:07] slammers199: What key did he do on his brewmaster?
[2:26:53] indiegarona: Everyone feared for your life, there.
[2:26:59] kokochris: as for torghast. I know you are against gearing or currency for gear. however I still believe it's a good idea. the gear item level should be at your current world quest level. right now for catch-up outside of raids and dungeons you have world quests. but the rate at which they are available is limited and slow. allow for that catch-up in torghast.
[2:27:08] inx_nz: !classic
[2:27:11] leshiltv: Max from Limit says Blood Dk will be top dog tank next raid tier he thinks. They pack the dps of other tanks rn. It was on his stream yesterday.
[2:27:14] inx_nz: Yo @Towelliee did u play Classic bor?

[2:29:32] VGSquirtle: Playing that long con bear tank
[2:29:39] leshiltv: Pally as a class in general is in a great place rn all specs
[2:29:59] cheersfordoobies: necrolord
[2:30:04] the_robinhood: kyrian
[2:30:11] deckardblade: id wait until 9.1 i bet they change a lot of the covenants
[2:30:13] PlayKn1ght: venthyr is for m+
[2:30:15] PlayKn1ght: for blood
[2:30:16] trawsz: What is this class you’re playing now? A monk?
[2:30:22] Mallaes: Most UH DK that I've saw go Necrolord
[2:30:23] the_robinhood: yeah. venthyr is M+ and Kyrian is raid tier.
[2:30:24] MrFuzzynuts420: I just want healing to be better on my vengeance and I’ll be happy
[2:30:25] cheersfordoobies: from what ive seen for multispec blood
[2:30:27] indiegarona: Venthyr is just the best because... story.
[2:30:32] cheersfordoobies: not very many mainspec blood
[2:30:34] ZynysterTV: Kyrian for raid and Venthyr for m+
[2:30:43] thebakeriscomingforu: prot pally was designed to consecrate and stand their ground. issue is that most fights any more require movement. Perhaps the mastery needs redesigned for paladins?
[2:30:46] jerexify: I play Venthyr, but I'm also only raiding at the Heroic level on my Blood DK.
[2:30:57] oraclespyro: guildie of mine said kyrian
[2:31:00] CazualD: Myriam supposed to be best for raiding
[2:31:10] cheersfordoobies: i only run like 10s and 11s and ive mostly seen necrolord bloods
[2:31:10] CazualD: Kyrian*
[2:31:12] indiegarona: I mean, what other covenant lets you drag around shirtless, brooding Kael'Thas in chains?
[2:31:14] Affiiance: Honestly The Blood DK Covenants are pretty balanced
[2:31:26] the_robinhood: blood is pretty bad right now.

[2:33:07] lithium364: frost got mega nerfed the last 4 weeks of beta yeah
[2:33:10] leshiltv: 1 was my guild lol we have a blood dk
[2:33:27] cheersfordoobies: looks like kyrian for raiding yeah
[2:33:33] porowozek: I remember one guy raiding as Survival in Nyalotha with us and you couldn't see his rating in logs cause there was "less then 300 parses" or some shit slootKEKW

[2:34:50] indiegarona: I did a Spires 11 a few nights ago and wanted to gouge my eyes out.
[2:34:50] parlangua89: will this change once all the soulbinds get unlocked?
[2:34:54] leshiltv: That 2nd boss is my bane
[2:35:19] jerexify: @Towelliee Out of curiosity, why not 15s?
[2:35:23] indiegarona: @leshiltv the gauntlet is the worst boss in there, lol
[2:35:36] Affiiance: What the best way to farm Renown for catch up on alts?
[2:35:44] jerexify: @Towelliee Ah, it just sounded like you were specifically targeting 14s.
[2:36:20] leshiltv: Blizz needs to change that imo...15+ should be more rewarding
[2:36:28] Gruffian: It's like always the opposite of what you think
[2:36:33] indiegarona: @Towelliee not sure if you saw, but earlier I said congrats on the house! So happy for you guys. Growing up so fast!
[2:36:49] BIueDream: @Affiiance just playing the game will catch you up, even dungeons will drop renown.

[2:40:08] Gruffian: Upgrading the renown gear is basically free 197 or whatever max is
[2:40:13] thebakeriscomingforu: gearing up is easy enough until 197
[2:40:15] D3m0nHunt3r666: 197 are dropped from caches as well
[2:40:16] cheersfordoobies: thats what im doing a alt for profs @Indiegarona

[2:41:44] PlayKn1ght: we have unfinished business in nf land
[2:41:50] cheersfordoobies: how long until 9.1 do you think few months?
[2:42:14] GalapagosPlays: I like you man
[2:42:19] Fhirn: I love shadowlands, but for once i wish blizz would just balance stuff in rapid mode
[2:42:29] Masqerader: which means flying will come slower /cry
[2:42:34] chyzzle05: How do you have all of those anima streams
[2:42:40] lithium364: i wonder if they will nerf the itemlvl increase with 9.1 and the following patches so we keep our 9.0 gear longer
[2:42:45] akia03: april is to long a wait imo
[2:42:46] Thoreya: i mean they did say that its different from bfa where they dont have to put a big fire out
[2:42:59] cheersfordoobies: yeah how funny was that soft buff to convoke and them reverting it so fast hahaha
[2:43:10] GalapagosPlays: What’s the best bag
[2:43:31] N3llee: That next tier isnt happening till spring
[2:43:31] akia03: lots of cassuals will be gone than i think if no new content before march
[2:43:36] byrdeen45: there going to lose so meny players becouse of gear
[2:43:39] Affiiance: They always give catchup gear at the beginning of each Patch
[2:43:41] AgentWhiskeyy: its true
[2:43:48] AyeitzDenny: lol i wonder if gearing is shit on purpose, so that they can have more time for new content
[2:43:50] kokochris: yup that's exactly what's gonna happen
[2:43:50] AgentWhiskeyy: because at a certain point theres like a curve
[2:43:58] Armdel: and here i am hoping to hit 210 before the next tier
[2:44:02] angmar95: will there be a 9.0.5?
[2:44:17] lithium364: if they dont do it casual guilds will quit just like they did after the first raiding tier in cataclysm
[2:44:42] kokochris: if your behind. just start your own raid and invite people who need gear too. it will fill up, and you may have alot of fun together. I found the best groups this way. no one acted like a toddler and everyone was having fun
[2:44:44] Affiiance: I mean Im at 217 not doing any Mythic Raiding, so the gearing isnt that bad
[2:44:46] Fat_Saq22: i am happy with my 199 gear
[2:44:46] GalapagosPlays: What do you class as a causal player
[2:44:49] jerexify: @Armdel Me too. lol I'm close, but the RNG gods have decided that I'm never getting a weapon upgrade.
[2:44:52] byrdeen45: Are they trying to drive away the casual players
[2:44:55] Kriven: BC is cool and I loved the expansion but im not all that excited for playing older content again.
[2:45:21] thiccsushi: damn just heard sloots guild died PepeWhy
[2:45:22] lithium364: i wish callings would reward anima...
[2:45:29] GalapagosPlays: What is a casual player lol...
[2:45:39] lanara233: @lithium364 yeah that would be cool
[2:45:44] N3llee: we are at the 30-60 day mark now so
[2:45:51] akia03: have to milk those 6 month subs
[2:46:03] kokochris: at one point the will release all the catch-up mechanics. for now, drag it out a bit.
[2:46:03] Thunderbrew: Casual players pay the bills

[2:46:14] Pey0: need a dps T?

[2:46:27] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Been breezing through the Ardenweald storyline on my hunter.
[2:46:32] Syllvn: As someone playing Casually atm, still so much to do I haven't been too concerned with the gear, though I would be more inclined to try more if it wasn't so bad.
[2:46:36] akia03: exodus already started
[2:46:36] D3m0nHunt3r666: 215 !? tastelessRage

[3:03:35] UberManDude: @Towelliee Not going to lie, It's rare that I see some tanks use their own HP pots. As a healer, that makes me happy, lol.

[3:06:23] UberManDude: @tawney_owl_ I find that so weird. I have a warrior prot tank as an alt and I use ALL of the buttons when the situations comes for it. If its there, one should use it right?

[3:07:15] Captain_nShaneO: np.. all i play is monk so it's nice to see people show interest LUL
[3:07:39] foxies_havocing: you just move left right :O
[3:07:52] tawney_owl_: @UberManDude Im not super amaizng at BM so maybe im not getting the max useage out of it, but in my eperience alot of their utilities are for more specific damage situtaions, the rest of it is generally just keeping ur stagger under control and fortifying using ur brew stacks
[3:07:57] Veegore: did they fix the skip ahead for the shield and come back?
[3:07:58] Endy253: Did blizz consider the 2nd boss cheat bannable?
[3:07:59] I_DoctorSatan_I: You still would be having Pride in that area anyway going into the boss you'll still have the same trash + 1 elite to get another Pride before this boss.
[3:08:00] D3m0nHunt3r666: just gotta be aware of when it comes tastelessLUL

[3:13:47] Frostfury: Sooo thoughts of Sloot ? :( @Towelliee me sad
[3:13:49] I_DoctorSatan_I: If you lust here, you *might* have lust for the last boss b/c of mob density from here on out, plus this being a 14 anyway.
[3:13:59] mainian: You can actually drop down to boss #3 room kill some trash down there summon prideful, go back to 2nd boss :) Also, couldn't post this earlier :(. Some how I was not a follower on twitch but have been a follower on tweeter for 5 years? ... priorities
[3:14:23] MOLAR305: @mainian they fixed it and you cant pull boss

[3:15:41] Frostfury: It fucking hurts like hell on Prot Pallies
[3:15:46] I_DoctorSatan_I: RDPS should be getting the outter orbs while the melee and tank get the closer orbs to boss

[4:07:03] massivekity: Been there
[4:07:05] Ariktor: you gotta grip when the vulpin casts the fixation its not fixed
[4:07:19] Apakuli: You have two dks
[4:07:21] Apakuli: who can brez
[4:07:28] pera_red: dk?

[4:12:01] I_DoctorSatan_I: most DK's know about this "bug" oO whatchu talking about

[4:15:25] metavahn231: "best and worst M+" isnt that exciting
[4:15:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: I dont understand why Blizzard would even touch this to hot fix it. If you can PREVENT damage happening to you or anyother player, this is basically using "spells" to mitigate the Vulpins ability to deal dmg. People see it as a "exploit" or "bug" but I see it (and use it) for survival.

[4:18:27] Choopa73: Are they bringing back sets for next patch?

[4:21:18] Masqerader: lol pet loot, thanks blizzard
[4:21:43] tawney_owl_: thx chat
[4:21:48] 4996kyle: i feel like 80% of the keys i get are sanguine

[4:22:08] Masqerader: i only get spires
[4:22:20] 4996kyle: i wonder if theyre gonna actually nerf sanguine so it isnt aids every week
[4:22:30] metavahn231: i spam spires of ascenion because it has 3 weaps heh
[4:22:33] 4996kyle: no other dungeon is that difficult
[4:23:04] pereadin: I have an easy key on my DK iirc
[4:23:38] 4996kyle: whats that map overlay for oribos?
[4:23:53] neverbornlucky: Finally got my Paladin to level 60
[4:24:10] D3m0nHunt3r666: So many bugs in spires I found in the last couples of days
[4:24:13] Strik3r019: that 2nd boss is aids
[4:24:34] symesc: its not even 2nd boss...its the first boss if you dont have enough dps/ healing
[4:24:45] pereadin: Raging Frenzied Ghouls KEKw
[4:24:53] 4996kyle: its every boss LOL
[4:24:57] 4996kyle: 1st/2nd xtra aids
[4:25:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: the dungeon is bad not just the 2nd boss xd
[4:25:12] D3m0nHunt3r666: Give us more gear so we have less issues tastelessLUL
[4:25:13] Vigi9413: the gauntlet at the end is aids
[4:25:14] 4996kyle: yea the trash is also strong af
[4:25:19] fistofnature: i got pushed off the edge on the first sanguine boss LULW
[4:25:22] Kaykerrs: First boss is ez with prideful
[4:25:34] swordwindgaming: They won't change it because it just hurts people who run m+
[4:25:38] 4996kyle: i kinda dlike loot being low
[4:25:40] Chazbad: I don't really feel like second boss i SD is too bed. You just need to rotate somewhat cd's & you can't have to much ramp damage on the ad
[4:25:42] vyjinx: they are changing loot ?
[4:25:42] D3m0nHunt3r666: isnt that what happened to essences LUL
[4:25:43] swordwindgaming: casuals don't really run m+ a lot so who cares
[4:25:44] 4996kyle: i hated having to super grind to keep up
[4:25:53] SpoonManes: wooo lol
[4:26:00] 4996kyle: wiat what are they doing with loot?
[4:26:03] zipocal: an upgrade system would be nice to keep it even with the pvp system
[4:26:06] kingkongibeton: is them changing it confirmed?
[4:26:08] Squid1030: they are changing loot?
[4:26:18] pmdawg: WAIT WHAT, EVERYONE GETS LOOT GARANTEES IN DUNGEONS AND RAIDS?
[4:26:33] FOI2EST: 2 pieces of gear for 5 ppl after 40min is trash
[4:26:35] pereadin: wait, theres a hard confirm they're changing it?
[4:26:41] metavahn231: i just want M+ to not be terrible
[4:26:43] D3m0nHunt3r666: I think they will revert for M+
[4:26:50] Cosmolus: @4996kyle You sir . You like being punched in the dick i can tell
[4:26:55] 4996kyle: yea id rather them increase m+ end chest than give some upgrade system
[4:26:59] lithium364: ion blue post blaming pve players for not gearing with pvp incoming Kappa
[4:27:09] pereadin: I just want ilevel from M+ to be slightly higher. give me 220's out of 15's at the most
[4:27:11] metavahn231: titanforging returns
[4:27:15] D3m0nHunt3r666: it's funny you get more loot from regular mythic than a m+ LUL
[4:27:16] ManneehFresh: not better just less shitty lol
[4:27:21] kingkongibeton: whats your thoughts should they give same amount of loot for m+ and higher ilvl or more loot?
[4:27:21] dmac614: Why toon did you get the maw mount on?
[4:27:22] Snup78: cant they make an xpac that work well for 2 years by litsening to us ?
[4:27:27] Kromede: ions formula: shit x 2 Kappa
[4:27:31] Slitze: what u vaping?
[4:27:47] Velashen: Loot should feel special. The old way of giving it out like candy never felt rewarding either. Hopefully they find a good compromise.

[4:27:49] Prettyneat: I think one of the biggest problems with the loot changes is still not being able to trade a bad piece in a mythic raid. The scarcity is fine, not being able to trade it is stupid.
[4:27:53] neverbornlucky: I'm casual I don't need loot just let me play the game and see stuff
[4:27:53] Molvonos: 226 Quantum Device inc
[4:27:54] tekfury: its gonna be expensive tho :(
[4:27:54] board4life65: he knows!!
[4:27:55] ManneehFresh: that would be the best solution to balance the pvp vendorwith a pve vendor
[4:27:58] Aro725: i dont think youll be able to buy it, but youll be able to upgrade the pieces you have
[4:28:03] Vigi9413: I'll probably only say this once but.... the Ardenweald story campaign was pretty good
[4:28:06] Tyduss89: do it like pvp?
[4:28:10] bonebolts: how was the currency done in BFA ? dailies?
[4:28:11] jakobsurfs: What about a random token instead of exact gear?
[4:28:15] metavahn231: is that insder knowledge Kappa
[4:28:18] Veegore: oine from each row would be great
[4:28:18] blucifer1320: Like conq and valor
[4:28:26] PhillyDilly18: @Towelliee I am still surprised that they make these changes if they are just going to revert them back and/or change them.
[4:28:41] metavahn231: thats exactly what FFXIV does
[4:28:46] blucifer1320: Like we used to
[4:29:10] metavahn231: and xiv has never had complaints of loot
[4:29:10] Aidler: so I will not get anything towLul
[4:29:18] Kromede: StinkyGlitch
[4:29:22] Daismoon: Show your maw mount
[4:29:29] blucifer1320: No back when you could collect badges and buy gear
[4:29:45] board4life65: one piece of loot from each raid, mythic + and pvp ?
[4:29:57] s4boi: They cant have a game where you PvP to gear for PvE
[4:29:58] Snup78: pvp havent got loot for 6 years
[4:30:06] pmdawg: is this all hypothetical?
[4:30:27] Sandisy: that pvp gives the best loot outside mythic raiding is very bad. I mean, what % raids mythic? 0.05%?
[4:30:33] Alt_slash: Alt_slash subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[4:30:36] Sedoris: Revenge thinking is nasty
[4:30:37] Aro725: they arent changing pvp gear. they said they love it and its staying the same. They need to change PVE gear. doing that doesnt mean pvp will change
[4:30:41] blucifer1320: I think ppl want this to be too fast anyway. The idea that the mythic raid was beat in a week is sad
[4:30:46] Kromede: i want gear from pet battles
[4:30:47] noteworthynerd: I absolutely cannot stand that mindset... Instead of "They shouldn't have that because we didn't!" it should be "We all get loot!"
[4:30:47] s4boi: specially for classes where Versatility, main stat for PvP is, their best secondary stat
[4:30:51] Wulfgrym: agreed and agreed
[4:30:55] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[4:30:56] metavahn231: maybe it should be balanced? instead of one or the other lol
[4:30:57] MrGattz: you dont break something just because something else was broken that you fixed. you dont go and break your car because you fixed your broken tv.

[4:31:26] 4996kyle: 100% agree right there
[4:31:27] Snup78: no legendary either :)
[4:31:29] 4996kyle: also bring back master loot.
[4:31:32] Molvonos: The 'I Got Mine, fuck ya'll' mentality is bad.
[4:31:33] mrelgaato: Give back essences
[4:31:33] kingkongibeton: what do you think of m+ ilvl drops compared to raid?
[4:31:35] D3m0nHunt3r666: and give back coins :P
[4:31:38] s4boi: Legit statement
[4:31:40] lithium364: yeah classes with vers as their best stat for pve is even worse, literally not needing to raid normal/hc with your guild cause pvp gear is fully better then nathria pieces
[4:31:40] board4life65: one piece of loot from each raid, mythic + and pvp from the weekly vault?
[4:31:41] mrelgaato: essences are fun
[4:31:47] 4996kyle: i've heard there reasoning behind not having master loot and its just dumb to me
[4:31:52] metavahn231: why cant M+
[4:32:03] Cosmolus: PREACH
[4:32:06] 4996kyle: their*
[4:32:10] swordwindgaming: they want to keep dungeon activity high so reducing loot drops forces people to run more runs with more people
[4:32:17] kingkongibeton: a m+ 15-key is wayyy harder than any heroic raid content though i feel like
[4:32:18] swordwindgaming: but pvp is available for easier loot so f that
[4:32:36] D3m0nHunt3r666: My class sucks in heroic and not in m+, what an easy choice tastelessLUL
[4:32:38] Wulfgrym: they took away the ilvl and took away the loot, so what is the point of m+
[4:32:43] noteworthynerd: You're right, but you only need 4 friends for a 15 @kingkongibeton
[4:32:43] Snup78: but m+ killed raiding they tried to fix it i guess
[4:33:07] kingkongibeton: @noteworthynerd yea true
[4:33:17] Armdel: They could even carry Quin
[4:33:28] metavahn231: blizz tried to force everyone into raiding, but I think they are going to quit instead
[4:33:47] metavahn231: and certainly they wont pvp
[4:33:57] Roaringkittylol: Good
[4:34:02] cowthulhu1: I know a dozen people that have already quit.
[4:34:02] safeway10: keyzike subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[4:34:06] bmi86: @Towelliee also the ppl that have the resources to spend on wow but not the time are old players who do not have the time to play much cous of work and family and stuff the could make time for maybe 1-2 m+ runs a week. will most likely dont see a reason to spend money on sub and tokens anymore
[4:34:09] lithium364: the pvp trinkets giving main stat on use eclipsing most raid trinkets is not helping aswell
[4:34:12] TheOGDaywalker: what up towelliee!
[4:34:24] ZetherTV: im 205 no raids was not ez haha
[4:34:26] pera_red: yeah the casual person doing around +6-8 are falling back hard now, im stuck at like 202 i lvl and everyone is on +14-15s
[4:34:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: I dont raid in my alts, but do m+, now m+ drops just makes it harder to keep on par with it
[4:34:27] swordwindgaming: my sub runs out in 4 days, still don't know if I'll resub despite having tokens out the arse
[4:34:28] trivwik: Are you surprised about the packers beating the Rams?
[4:34:37] metavahn231: but its like funneling people from one dumpster fire into another one gj
[4:34:41] AelyzZ: But you can do that, just do +12 gear up and go heroic? But yeah they should do 3 drops again..
[4:34:48] Aidler: @veramer I agree. many will quit. probably not forever but then again there are a lot of other games out there
[4:34:50] crashoverride_gaming: I’m still sour over no weapon drops in the raid
[4:34:55] cowthulhu1: Im 213 and have not raided or pvpd.
[4:35:00] Snup78: true
[4:35:15] Vigi9413: My friend bet me $100 that the Browns would wind tomorrow
[4:35:20] Vigi9413: easiest $100 i'll ever make
[4:35:22] akia03: @crashoverride_gaming weapon tokens drop there
[4:35:22] chessboxin34: donald has a separated rib so
[4:35:24] blucifer1320: It was the play, to raid for fun you need gear. Right now anyone clearing mythics and even most heroic are min/maxing which takes a lot of fun out of the game and ruins classes chances of being at raid
[4:35:29] swordwindgaming: raiding is pointless when you can get your 213s from arena
[4:35:33] Snup78: goat rogers
[4:35:33] Janribet: what do you think of bills vs ravens last night
[4:35:35] trivwik: What is your call on Tampa Bay and New Orleans?
[4:35:37] KPable: donald was hurt

[4:36:40] maxon1969: i think everything is fine most fun ive been having in along time
[4:37:09] managwinis: that was a vanilla thing
[4:37:10] noteworthynerd: I played Classic to get that feeling lol
[4:37:21] Sedoris: Taking something away from people always feels bad and they seem to forget that sometimes
[4:37:25] Hellbenderer: the feeling is: fustration LUL
[4:37:32] pera_red: grinding Kappa i did 40 ish +6s before i had a weapon drop
[4:37:34] leshiltv: Making getting a legendary different so it's more meaningful seems like it would be good no?
[4:37:34] Aidler: I remember some who propagated the „meaningful loot“ meta towLul
[4:37:34] lithium364: agree it feels like cataclysm all over again
[4:37:36] blucifer1320: Do you think the implementation of classic was a reason they made this move?
[4:37:36] ZetherTV: look at vanilla now too so corrupted
[4:37:42] Cosmolus: Yeah but i don't want to get dick slapped with 35 anima after a 10+ key
[4:37:42] Snup78: @whiteblondeboi most of them yes but they are !% of the player base
[4:37:45] bmi86: @Towelliee were not in kansas anymore toto
[4:37:47] Sandisy: balance the damn classes better. don't take 5-6 months to do a tuning pass. it's math, how hard can it be?
[4:37:48] KPable: had 2 officers in my guild last night retire bc of this issue
[4:37:48] MrGattz: if i wanted to "work" for my loot id demand to be paid irl. i want to play a game and relax and get loot. not work at a job im not getting paid for. or id go play classic.
[4:37:57] Captain_nShaneO: people had to actually CC LUL
[4:37:59] blucifer1320: Trying to bring back the “nostalgia” of it
[4:38:14] Roaringkittylol: Let them unsub then... there needs to be a transition phase back to normal. Stop catering to noobs.
[4:38:14] lithium364: the class balancing still happening every 5-6 month again is actually pissing me off already
[4:38:15] meatshield2012: yea i made it to the second lving zone and was already over wow 2nd xpac i had zero excitement about time to move on
[4:38:19] kandorkaboom: best solution, more and more difficulties. and scaling difficulties. The more options for loot the better.
[4:38:25] Kromede: until blizzard gets angry and give us SELFIE ULTRA-HD and Pepe Mount
[4:38:29] Snup78: @whiteblondeboi yup LUL
[4:38:31] pera_red: @MrGattz i feel the same way 100%
[4:38:47] kovex: so wait how do you have your mount in the maw?
[4:38:48] talic420: they cut it to low to fast
[4:38:49] Sedoris: Stop poking the dead horse that's been buried... leave it in the ground
[4:38:58] Vigi9413: I wish they gave you a title for completing your covenant campaign
[4:39:02] runiih: In other hand they give obnoxious good gear progression for pvp KEKW
[4:39:10] Sedoris: @Vigi9413 You get a title at 40 renown
[4:39:15] Luuin: @Towelliee the people who went through that feeling in vanilla aren't 18 years old anymore with tons of free time to grind all that gear.
[4:39:17] noteworthynerd: I think that if PVP were the same way, people might be more willing. But PVP isn't the same way so they need to buff PVE
[4:39:35] D3m0nHunt3r666: Sometimes I feel when they make drastic changes...just like the GCD in BFA they just shoot their own foor on purpose tastelessLUL
[4:39:49] Kromede: KEKW
[4:39:54] anithics: kekw
[4:39:56] Snup78: KEKW
[4:39:59] Aidler: @mrgattz agree. I have enough challenges irl

[4:40:35] RobNXS: 2 zones is like an hour lol

[4:40:41] Kromede: perhaps gold making is the way to go, i'm at 2 mill with low effort Kappa
[4:40:49] 4996kyle: also glad we're not doing around the world every difficulty for AP
[4:40:52] Wranglicon: i do feel reigning in the loot dropping was a good idea. they just went way too far.
[4:40:53] JacobBose: Its not a bad game its just not alt friendly so ppl try to come up with excuses
[4:40:56] Vigi9413: I love this stupid, unbalance fucking game
[4:41:04] talic420: and riots mmo will not be out till next wow exp if that
[4:41:04] dirrtygrrl: How long do you feel it should take you to get BiS geared on a toon? I
[4:41:09] swordwindgaming: SL is real good for gold making
[4:41:12] blucifer1320: I haven’t played since wrath and I’m building a machine to come back because I see a lot of old school dudes I was running with smashing
[4:41:22] maxlol: i have a friend that literally logs on everyday just do farm gold
[4:41:39] Mecabeast: some people want parse
[4:41:43] trivwik: lolol That is so true
[4:41:43] Kromede: bumbelbeetuna
[4:41:51] Luuin: @Towelliee had that happen in legion with Flasks I was selling
[4:41:52] Sedoris: Ah... that's when, out of spite, you sell it even lower.
[4:41:54] lithium364: gold mafia so true
[4:42:17] Relbain: @Towelliee How do you feel about tanks at this point of the expansion?
[4:42:25] zanis_: Playing how frequently though ?
[4:42:30] swordwindgaming: if I could live with it, I would farm furs all day for that easy blue fur. Might as well buy BoEs that way.
[4:42:32] Vigi9413: if you gear just by m+ you might hit 210 by March Kappa
[4:42:41] FOI2EST: i got roasted for undercutting a BoE 2H by 5k lol
[4:42:50] blucifer1320: Fuck yeah man 2 is legit

[4:42:56] trivwik: I have ran HoA like ten times for a staff and haven't gotten it yet. That is just in the past 3 days. Not including since expac dropped
[4:43:02] eyyorlay1c1: how much?
[4:43:15] Ponickz: whats the avg price
[4:43:16] KayEeVeeEyeEn: anyone know if frost dk leg should be absolute zero for arenas?
[4:43:17] dirrtygrrl: And the follow up to that BiS question is if no TF/Corruption and loot dropped as it did in the past and everyone was BiS in 2 months, what do they have to work for gear wise for the rest of that patch
[4:43:28] swordwindgaming: @pfylow I killed the first boss of Necrotic Wake on heroic 100 times for the gun drop and it only dropped twice.
[4:43:28] MrTrevinoo: !playlist
[4:43:43] maxlol: whats this level15/level25 raider thing?
[4:43:48] trivwik: oof @swordwindgaming
[4:43:52] eyyorlay1c1: reasonable
[4:44:00] Captain_nShaneO: @swordwindgaming did you leave after the first boss or finish the dungeon with your group?
[4:44:02] jordono176: Would you ever consider selling for a community?
[4:44:07] The420batman: what about prime subs? lmao
[4:44:13] BadLuckGamingNA: @Towelliee 31k a good buy in
[4:44:15] D3m0nHunt3r666: I come from Tow stream , show me discount code Kappa
[4:44:16] Vigi9413: do you get a finder's cut?
[4:44:25] jordono176: A gold only community
[4:44:36] Crowzcut: towel i been selling torhgast
[4:44:39] The420batman: gallywix was a "gold only" community
[4:44:40] cowthulhu1: selling should stop as well. it makes people lazy.
[4:44:53] propwash80: @Towelliee is it possible to still get the maw mount or is that a timed event?
[4:45:01] kandorkaboom: @cowthulhu1 that's a silly opinion. MMOs will always have carries. That's part of it.
[4:45:04] Vigi9413: what's wrong with selling?
[4:45:05] Gladiator816: @cowthulhu1 I think it’s more about time constraints. Not everyone has hours to wipe on bosses.
[4:45:07] RobNXS: Would we need to be an actual contributing member of the team? Or could I bring a ilvl 150 alt in haha
[4:45:15] Vigi9413: if people got gold who are you to tell them not to buy carries?
[4:45:21] The420batman: @propwash80 you can do the twisting corridors and if you complete layer 8 you get a mount
[4:45:23] Captain_nShaneO: i bet blizz is doing the math on all the dungeon/raid selling and by next xpac they'll do it themselves... "gear store"
[4:45:36] lithium364: yeha time for that blizzard gear store
[4:45:37] Molvonos: Uh, yea.
[4:45:45] lithium364: Kappa
[4:45:45] Clicklesly: Sell runs often require you to suicide at the pull iirc, so no contributing ^^
[4:45:46] propwash80: @The420batman is the twisting corridor always open or does it cycle?
[4:45:48] bonebolts: everquest FeelsAmazingMan
[4:45:49] Molvonos: "WTS LODI CAMP, 2mil GOLD, PST"
[4:45:51] Crowzcut: @Towelliee i made 2.1mil with torghast
[4:45:57] blucifer1320: Sold buffs in eq
[4:46:03] Sedoris: if I wanna spend my gold on ERP in goldshire, or Gear, that's my darn right
[4:46:07] figurines: its the dirty truth of lots of these "gold" sales is that the mythic raiding guilds pay irl money. so its not cool and not OK
[4:46:14] MrTrevinoo: from where are you streaming the WoW music, towelliee?
[4:46:14] Vigi9413: where exactly can you advertise now?
[4:46:15] Velashen: Turning tricks in chat for gold Kappa
[4:46:21] Crowzcut: yes 250k a run on twisting
[4:46:27] Molvonos: @figurines You got facts to back you up, or that heresay?
[4:46:33] The420batman: @CrowzCut what class you use to run it for selling?
[4:46:33] vaalie: 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨
[4:46:39] metavahn231: once blizzard put in tokens you can buy with real money it was anything goes
[4:46:41] Vigi9413: WF raiders to sale runs to pay back their debt
[4:46:52] Crowzcut: 3 paladin and dk
[4:46:52] Brodih_: any news from Sloot ?
[4:46:53] maxlol: Blizz has really cracked down on RMT, sure they still exist but its mostly just for gold
[4:47:00] The420batman: ah you 5 man it?
[4:47:02] brokenjester: ive never cared very much about how other people play a game or what they do in a game the way some wow players do
[4:47:30] smilylol_: @Towelliee what does ur guild usually charge for a H CN run?
[4:47:35] Vigi9413: Imagine it's your 6th alt... do you want to gear it yourself? or pay some gold and get loot funneled ?
[4:47:40] blucifer1320: If they would give back ML we could GDKP again and that was actually fun

[4:48:03] jason_shade: i liked gdkp a lot
[4:48:06] Vigi9413: idk how he hasn't burnt out
[4:48:06] Kindosar: more context, full time job is 2080 hours
[4:48:09] D3m0nHunt3r666: so he burned himself lol
[4:48:11] juryvicious2: the man put in his time
[4:48:11] Gladiator816: @maxlol Well now people just buy WoW tokens to get gold if need be. So blizzard is making their money regardless
[4:48:13] HwmTheWigl: I think its absolutely stupid to pay real money to get carried through a video game.

[4:58:17] Aidler: is there a spot open for Sloot in BDG?
[4:58:20] Brodih_: @Zarinna2015 no Teggu
[4:58:21] Vigi9413: I'd like to see him just tank
[4:58:22] Tru1485: the guild dies

[5:01:01] Brodih_: also Sloot joining a guild will give it a lot more visibility since he's is so well known in the WoW community
[5:01:06] Kinghorn: towCry
[5:01:14] Vigi9413: @Hitokiri83 sloot would never be satisfied in shade
[5:01:19] kekwnano: Sloot and Max would be god tier combo
[5:01:23] Frostfury: Any guild out there even top 10 will take Sloot
[5:01:41] Hitokiri83: @Vigi9413 i know would be a pipe dream
[5:01:41] Vigi9413: what about FSY?
[5:01:50] noteworthynerd: Yeah Golden Guardians
[5:01:52] Jarlan23: max was more interested in their weak aura maker

[5:02:47] Tipullo: You're right though at this point it makes no sense for him to stick EU
[5:02:48] Frostfury: I am on Kazzak
[5:02:54] cazhually: i'm excitedt to find out
[5:02:56] fivz__: why not Pieces?

[5:03:02] Frostfury: FatShark / Walkthrough are English guild
[5:03:08] Kinghorn: they dont noteworthynerd
[5:03:15] fivz__: yeh
[5:03:15] dreamwalker213: And he wouldn’t be day raiding those crazy hours with FSY
[5:03:18] noteworthynerd: Yeah I didn't think so
[5:03:38] Frostfury: But but Towelliee and Sloot? :o 2 amazing pallies <3
[5:04:02] Vigi9413: does FSY speak English?
[5:04:02] Crowzcut: method got news next week big one
[5:04:17] noteworthynerd: No I don't think so
[5:04:19] Aidler: towelliee and sloot would be something very special but not a WF guild towLul
[5:04:21] Xenoxis: Whats that addon for the mission table hes using
[5:04:22] diablo4andy: is mythic denathrius really 50min long kill?
[5:04:23] FOI2EST: I think he should tank for midwinter :^)
[5:04:24] Vigi9413: I assume they might
[5:04:24] Frostfury: Yes they do
[5:04:26] Crowzcut: no
[5:04:33] Vigi9413: don't they have to do hardcore raiding?
[5:04:36] Vigi9413: they're World 4

[5:05:29] Tipullo: Not sure they need a tank
[5:05:30] cazhually: why won't echo, or complexity limit
[5:05:32] Furiouszorn: what does sloot play now for progression?
[5:05:33] anithics: do you think he can just get in to one of them????
[5:05:37] anithics: is it some sort of process
[5:05:40] FosSiLiTate: Sloot should join the Russian or Korean guilds, they fit his culture of excellence
[5:05:41] CDubTheRIPper: someone is losing a spot soon LUL
[5:05:43] board4life65: Method?
[5:05:44] Kinghorn: sloot can play any tank
[5:05:45] cazhually: it would suck kick out their other tanks for sloot
[5:05:45] Vigi9413: I don't think echo/limit would have a spot open
[5:05:50] CDubTheRIPper: or maybe he just creates his own again
[5:05:50] cazhually: i don't if we would like that
[5:05:52] FOI2EST: is blood legion still around?
[5:06:00] dreamwalker213: Most of the top 10 guilds will have tanks already most likely which is the shitty part
[5:06:06] lumaday: perfect timing
[5:06:08] CDubTheRIPper: Santa towelliee is back giving out cloaks
[5:06:17] Kinghorn: either way I am excited to see what he does
[5:06:45] Aidler: @board4life65 I don‘t think Sloot and Sco would work well together in a raiding guild
