Is that the mood that you guys were looking for or pointing towards specifically?

Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, and after that u can study 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understud me.

[0:54:22] astrachanec: @Warcraft You added new subraces. It not absolutely new races, like worgens and goblins, or pandas. Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, and after that u can study 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understand me.

Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, doing quests. And step by step, you are stydying 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understand me.

If one character is better, the group will be better. With personal loot, you promote individualism and selfishness. Dont remove loot master

Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, and after that u can study 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understand me.
