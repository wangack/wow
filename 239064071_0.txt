Cata and WoD were very action packed, Mists was "cartoony" or a lighter mood," Legion was dark and somewhat alien. With BFA it seems that there's some sort of misty horror setting. Is that the mood that you guys were looking for or pointing towards specifically?

Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, and after that u can study 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understud me.

[0:54:22] astrachanec: @Warcraft You added new subraces. It not absolutely new races, like worgens and goblins, or pandas. Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, and after that u can study 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understand me.

[0:55:41] astrachanec: You added new subraces. It not absolutely new races, like worgens and goblins, or pandas. Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, doing quests. And step by step, you are stydying 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understand me.

[1:08:28] astrachanec: @Warcraft You added new subraces. It not absolutely new races, like worgens and goblins, or pandas. Du you planing doing this with classes? do you planing add more specs for existing classes? something like u r coming in location, farming reputation, and after that u can study 4-rt spec. you can give only DD clases 1 more role. something like blood mage, priestess of Eluna and something else. Sry, if my eng is bad, i hope u can understand me.
