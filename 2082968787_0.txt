[0:22:03] hitchmeister59: It's got teeth
[0:22:30] Lenitas: If they eat through their asshole, then their asshole doubles as a mouth and is therefore a mouth
[0:22:37] Sygorian: Dont all butts have teeth ? Wait...
[0:22:39] AssumptionPrime: I would think that definitionally, if they eat with it, it's the mouth and not the ass
[0:22:51] databob1: @taliesinandevitel I'm with you on this they are totally ass worms

[0:24:09] Rico_Azzarash: Oh no. You may regret that choice xD
[0:24:09] Coloredtoad: Why are streamers hyping up the skull x bones as housing?? its definitely not housing and it will just be an event that we kill mobs to fill a bar.
[0:24:10] morbid0ne: ...Karlach
[0:24:26] Rico_Azzarash: Just let me got home xD
[0:24:31] madmerco: My wife loves the movies but she can't get past the fact that Frank Herbert came up with all of this shit and then named his main character "Paul" .

[0:25:12] doomer_dan_: the alextrasza one is echoing too
[0:25:21] chryseis: It HAS to be next week, right??
[0:25:34] morbid0ne: @madmerco haha, so true. I guess they need the main protag to be relatable?

[0:27:58] og_muddpuppy: every Hollywood actor is a nepo baby at this point
[0:28:02] Kydar: No Echo on Karlach * :)
[0:28:07] RosieSeren: Surprises are great, but knowing and waiting for a surprise is not a nice feeling
[0:28:24] Elrathir: how did it feel to get ratioed by Holly?
[0:28:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin don't worry  wow devs learned from diablo devs with gauntlet release to keep them guessing
[0:28:43] Coloredtoad: I just hope all the build up is worth it and it doesn‚Äôt land with a resounding thud.
[0:29:16] morbid0ne: @rosieseren Don't most birthdays operate that way?
[0:29:22] TheFlypster: Tali you're beautiful and I love you
[0:29:27] proffknight: @taliesinandevitel do you think could do something crazy and just stealth drop the patch like a Beyonc√© album
[0:29:33] kaijoe_: At first, I read it as F You
[0:29:34] KeyouiX: fuck u
[0:29:35] mdeckTV: fuck
[0:29:43] literally_human_garbage: i think it's like a jokey disappointment
[0:29:43] chryseis: A little poke at the community reactions
[0:29:49] knightjudicator: a very neutral "oh no, no date again"
[0:29:52] MrScotticus: "it's unfortunate that we aren't getting a release date"
[0:29:52] Qargory: i read it as fuuuuuuuck
[0:29:53] Saiyori: A memey way to say FU for no release date lol
[0:29:53] Metket: some ppl went for hero talents my eyes
[0:29:54] Nerraw3: I read it as, "This blows"
[0:29:57] jimbowheat: you are saying "fuuuuuuck" sadly
[0:29:57] TiredZubat: the old school meme
[0:30:03] Syllvn: I am english and know your humour so I feel I can't judge.
[0:30:03] Rico_Azzarash: I read it like "Holy, please leave the comment below please"
[0:30:04] neverbornlucky: Taliesin what is tweeter? I don't even use X anymore
[0:30:08] Durwen: it could?
[0:30:14] holyzeke: that how I feel when you say the reset is delayed ü§£
[0:30:15] KeyouiX: i thought you meant fuck you but in a joke way
[0:30:28] liveshowfieldy: oh yeah I totally read it as jokey disappointment, which is why I was so confused by her ‚Äúsorry?‚Äù
[0:30:31] knightjudicator: there is NO WAY "ffffuuuu" is too old of a meme that people don't remember!!!
[0:30:37] madmerco: yeah, the lol makes it more of a friendly fuck off. like you're ribbing a friend.
[0:30:42] liveshowfieldy: I assumed the question mark was a typo
[0:30:46] bangoobangoo: Did Holly maybe read it as "F U"?
[0:30:49] nessimee: the lol in front took away that notion i think
[0:30:59] Durwen: yeah, I totally read as fuck you, sorry
[0:31:01] AlanC2024: seriously. thats what people thought
[0:31:16] darth_nykal: Lol it reads more like "fuck yooooouuuuuuuu!"
[0:31:17] DarthTaz0: text comedy can be rough
[0:31:24] kikisume: LUL LUL
[0:31:30] literally_human_garbage: i mean i understood it and i'm garbage, so what's everyone else's excuse?
[0:31:35] chryseis: Tone is easy to misinterpret online lol
[0:31:40] madmerco: I took it as less serious.
[0:31:41] Beertrain2k: "As long as I don't do anything stupid, I'll get this achievement... FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"
[0:31:49] Merex760: It's the internet in 2024 unless you communicate emotions/reactions in a gif, people will misread you
[0:31:51] dookie_44: lol F youuuuuuuuuu
[0:31:56] holyzeke: Talie we have gifs for that
[0:31:58] Coloredtoad: it‚Äôs like when Ralphie dropped the lug nuts in A Christmas Story‚Ä¶ Fuuuuuuuuuuuuddddgggeeeeee
[0:32:00] MrScotticus: It's easy to imagine why WoW devs might default to being on the defensive I guess
[0:32:01] bangoobangoo: RE-CANCELLED
[0:32:10] knightjudicator: how do you read this as "fuck you" :(
[0:32:21] liveshowfieldy: Americans just don‚Äôt get our humour man, learnt that the hard way at various NYC parties lmao
[0:32:34] Harper_n7: Harper_n7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto tneTayto
[0:32:42] hitchmeister59: Should've gone with the Vader "Nooooooooooooooo...."
[0:32:49] bangoobangoo: @knightjudicator The letters alone. People read things differently, a failing of the Internet. :)
[0:32:49] FelPlague: I think even if she knew it was a joke, with all the people being aholes it was prob just another needle on the camels back.
[0:32:51] knightjudicator: @liveshowfieldy fuuuu is a rage comic internet meme
[0:32:59] dookie_44: Sorry? no, f*ck YOU
[0:33:09] Balen_42: People are too sensitive nowadays
[0:33:19] restokin: Sorry, not sorry
[0:33:27] darth_nykal: I really feel like they're over-hyping it inadvertently
[0:33:37] Metket: holly is goddest
[0:33:42] knightjudicator: it's not too sensitive if they misread it as a fuck you
[0:33:43] patrickfitzsimmons: If the patch doesn't have something great in it, it won't end well anyway.
[0:33:45] Kainiee: they teased us too early
[0:33:51] FatCatDad48: Good afternoon folks!
[0:33:51] bigoldmeatpie: @knightjudicator tbf i don't know what it means so i googled and everything came up as "it means fuck"
[0:33:59] neverbornlucky: Taliesin tweeter is owned by Elon Musk so can't use it
[0:34:27] Metket: yeah i feel that
[0:34:27] cyclopsnerd: text communication is wonderful :)
[0:34:32] bettys_dungeon_adventures: sounds like you should apologize to Holly
[0:34:34] FelPlague: need to send holly some flowers and chocolates on patch day.
[0:34:35] bettys_dungeon_adventures: LUL
[0:34:37] morbid0ne: Maybe just a "NooooOOOOOoooo" would have gone over better?
[0:34:47] knightjudicator: should have posted the rage comic face
[0:35:02] morbid0ne: üò¨
[0:35:09] liveshowfieldy: @knightjudicator fair enough but the point still definitely stands regardless
[0:35:19] hyzenthlays: gotta start using more emoticons tali (o^o)
[0:35:32] Qargory: lmaoo
[0:35:33] Metket: LMAO
[0:35:36] Nerraw3: lolol
[0:35:40] knightjudicator: LUL NotLikeThis
[0:35:41] morbid0ne: LUL
[0:35:47] Qargory: one cancelled uk wow streamer to another
[0:35:49] neverbornlucky: Taliesin said donald trump
[0:35:57] literally_human_garbage: poor MrGM too lol
[0:35:58] all_beef_franks: do you think the "Bit o' Fun" part is meant to be said in a pirate type of slang? as a hint?
[0:36:01] Nulgar: heya
[0:36:02] DarthTaz0: a good gif would have cleared that up. needed Keanu yelling at the sky from Point Break under it
[0:36:11] morbid0ne: Yes
[0:36:17] nessimee: yes agreed
[0:36:18] Nulgar: oh, are we talking about the absolutely disingenous reactions to Holly's reply and your reply to hers?
[0:36:21] morbid0ne: Hindsight is 20/20
[0:36:24] nessimee: nooooo would have been the message
[0:36:27] kittiezZ_: i mean clearly it wasnt an FU it was a FUUUUUUU just missing the ck
[0:36:27] cabeshpash: lol
[0:36:30] kittiezZ_: XD
[0:37:08] bangoobangoo: From blue checks? Surely not.
[0:37:12] bettys_dungeon_adventures: the internet being unkind? no way, that never happens
[0:37:27] cabeshpash: the lack of content in the meantime is disappointing tbh
[0:37:30] DarthTaz0: I like it
[0:37:30] RosieSeren: I have to agree with fleks there
[0:37:30] fleks27: smart guy, i agree
[0:37:31] darth_nykal: Over-hype
[0:37:33] kaijoe_: I think it's fine!
[0:37:35] jimbowheat: It better not be really shit!
[0:37:36] DarthTaz0: fun to have a bit of mystery
[0:37:39] bettys_dungeon_adventures: i like it
[0:37:39] morbid0ne: I don't mind, as long as it matches the hype
[0:37:40] magemaster225: wish they put out hints each week
[0:37:40] Rico_Azzarash: I'm sorry I will interrupt us all for a bit
[0:37:42] Nulgar: honestly, it's a minor patch, and if there'd been a PTR for that, people would have talked about the datamined contents for a week, and then forget about it and/or complain that there's no new content on live realms
[0:37:42] Syllvn: It's fine?
[0:37:43] Shorpa: I like it
[0:37:43] apheelia96: When is the next update?
[0:37:43] cosmopanda13: It's been too long now for sure
[0:37:43] cabeshpash: I think it's going to get expectations too high probably
[0:37:44] MrScotticus: I think it hypes people up so much that it'll be hard to meet that hype
[0:37:45] FelPlague: I think having 10.2.6 be a ??? instead of a pirate flag woulda been better, but other then that idk
[0:37:50] proffknight: i like it, just hope its good
[0:37:51] RosieSeren: surprises are great, but knowing and waiting for a surprise is not a nice feeling
[0:37:52] showerbees: I‚Äôm still excited for it
[0:37:56] grimblymcgoo: Truthfully, nobody in my guild has even mentioned the patch once
[0:37:57] Dred_Scythe: Tease it when it's ready, a week out at most.
[0:37:59] chryseis: I liked it at first but I would have liked less time between hyping it and putting it out
[0:38:01] lellandria: might be starting to drag, hard to get excited about something without an endpoint in sight
[0:38:02] ryarose42: just have the knowledge that the longer something is kept enshrouded the higher the expectations build
[0:38:02] Sorin__: I think they hit an unexpected delay since some of the teasing died down
[0:38:04] kaijoe_: It's nice to see the team excited about it, so I don't really care what it ends up being
[0:38:07] neverbornlucky: More Pirate emotes from Muffin plz taliesin
[0:38:12] chico_escuela: indifference is what I feel
[0:38:13] Nerraw3: I'm fine with getting people excited about the game instead of "just another patch"
[0:38:19] Kydar: I like mystery but we need some scheduling?
[0:38:19] bangoobangoo: "We are here to serve" only feeds into people's entitlement tbh
[0:38:25] all_beef_franks: 10.2.5 was kind of a let down, so i think people are just wanting a bit more, at this stage of the xpac
[0:38:25] databob1: They should have done more teasing like official posts to hype it and give it a release date
[0:38:26] 1NessaToday: The fact that they didnt announce shit about this patch means this patch can only flop, even if it was player housing
[0:38:27] Rico_Azzarash: Rico_Azzarash subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[0:38:45] patrickfitzsimmons: Its a huge mistake as people will not be happy unless it has something great in it. They have been to secretive.
[0:38:48] TaliesinAndEvitel: tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneDisco tneTaliSelch
[0:38:50] dright424: I feel like a date would resolve all the frustration people have right now
[0:38:52] druidhex: what did MR GM say about palestine?
[0:38:54] Lenitas: No info on the content of the patch is fine, the lack of a release date to go with that is getting frustrating

[0:39:14] darth_nykal: Her constant wink-wink nudge-nudge is setting community expectations higher than they're going to deliver in a mid-major-patch patch.

[0:39:33] jimbowheat: @druidhex Nothing. He said something nice about Starbucks.
[0:39:34] xantoor: I think with the season nearing a close (people finishing their ratings in arena/ and raiding tempo) there is a bit of a lull.. and lack of news or content.. and just expansion speculation for a month + is just .. tiresom.. (( plus many of us remember the Warlords of Draenor -- LONG drought)
[0:39:41] apheelia96: I like secrets except for when. cause I like to plan
[0:39:41] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can you tell muffin to  tweet more pirate emotes plz
[0:39:47] cabeshpash: I'm fine with the mystery as well, but the content drought is rough rn

[0:40:13] 1NessaToday: I think this tease would be better at the start of an expansion rather then at the very end where we are reaching for every straw
[0:40:18] doomer_dan_: I've always wondered what glucose parent means. can you explain it?
[0:40:18] madmerco: tneEviHeart tneEviHeart
[0:40:19] Harper_n7: You already did but thank you again :)
[0:40:23] apheelia96: YES
[0:40:26] liveshowfieldy: I feel like it was a really risky move. the long drawn out silence over it, the lack of PTR combined with how early it was teased has created an enormous, almost unnecessary amount of pressure for whatever 10.2.6 is, to be phenomenal at a time where faith in the game isn‚Äôt at an all time high.
[0:40:44] Rico_Azzarash: The proper Anniversary !
[0:40:46] Kydar: @doomer_dan_ sugar daddy/sugar mommy/sugar baby = glucose parenting
[0:40:46] Nulgar: Nulgar gifted a Tier 1 sub to databob1! They have given 231 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:41:13] cabeshpash: what vitamins?
[0:41:19] patrickfitzsimmons: you can only be this secretive if its something great, so if its not it wont end well.
[0:41:22] bigoldmeatpie: @TaliesinAndEvitel i always took it that based on how the flag is on the roadmap that it'll drop the 3rd week of march since it's sat right on the line between winter and spring
[0:41:22] yuumleague: thank you for your last video! i loved it very much, your joy for wow is contagious :D
[0:41:29] doomer_dan_: @Kydar ohhhhmg ty i feel so dumb haha.
[0:41:35] 1NessaToday: At this point the whole patch should be a joke. Pirate transmog for free for logging in, along with a sign that says "lol fuuuu"
[0:41:56] kittiezZ_: idc what the patch is - i would just like to know when to expect it, i totally agree
[0:42:01] Kydar: @doomer_dan_ all good! there are too many things to learn for average culture nowadays, always okay to ask :)
[0:42:09] neverbornlucky: Taliesin its ok we all get old and have to start BALUE cHEWY
[0:42:14] showerbees: that would feel bad, I pretty much always log on with plans
[0:42:18] bottis96: no date means they changed something
[0:42:23] Nevom_: The pirate patch has been drawn out too long, when you're wife says she's got some exciting news and won't tell you, after a while you just say, you know, I'm not that interested anymore
[0:42:30] bottis96: not ready yet
[0:42:40] bettys_dungeon_adventures: i bet its player housing LUL
[0:42:41] cabeshpash: that's true I didn't think of that
[0:43:02] morbid0ne: I mean, it could be cool because we'll all be in the dark about it equally like back in the day. But yeah, I get that.
[0:43:08] konndor91: Also some of us would like to take off work...
[0:43:08] Coloredtoad: Didn‚Äôt they say the patch will still be on the ptr at some point?
[0:43:14] showerbees: no chance they don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs coming out right?
[0:43:16] 1NessaToday: Can we make a bingo card for this patch? Could be amazing content for the weekly reset after launch, just in case its a flop
[0:43:23] Lenitas: I also would like to know for sure that a secret drop like that to be global
[0:43:41] cabeshpash: @Coloredtoad I don't think it's going to be on PTR
[0:43:50] Rico_Azzarash: There is also a danger zone where people get to high expectation wich will not be comparable with reality
[0:44:15] Kydar: @Rico_Azzarash fully agreed!
[0:44:22] Caladin_the_Paladin: Thank you for the gift sub, @TaliesinAndEvitel . Much obliged to you. And thank you to the one who made that possible (Sorry, I've forgotten your name). Cheers! tneWineTime
[0:44:31] cabeshpash: honestly if 10.2.5 had more content then it would be a non issue I think
[0:44:43] Nulgar: it's @Rico_Azzarash!!!
[0:44:52] 1NessaToday: Would a random drop be better if it wasnt on the timeline? That way 10.2.6 would feel more like a plus
[0:45:00] cabeshpash: lol yup
[0:45:03] cyclopsnerd: ugh that 5 tier reputation not having any reward was so frustrating
[0:45:10] Lenitas: I keep forgetting about digs, I did them on release day and never after
[0:45:13] Harper_n7: wtf are digs?
[0:45:16] caradosailanthus: The lesson to learn is to wait until the content is at a point when a release date is internally known before hyping
[0:45:22] cabeshpash: I didn't care about any of the rewards, and it was super buggy
[0:45:23] holyzeke: digs can F right off
[0:45:35] chlorophyllkid: i'd say there are 50% of ppl who enjoy diggs *wink*
[0:45:41] patrickfitzsimmons: They should have given a rough date and give people a rough idea to cover expectation, something to focus on.
[0:45:49] Nulgar: oh, I think I forgot to do the Dig last week
[0:45:53] bigoldmeatpie: i did it once and said "oh that's a thing" and didn't do another one
[0:46:05] konndor91: The quality and implementation of digs makes me worry about the quality of the 10.2.6 event
[0:46:07] Nulgar: no wait, I remember getting the DMF buff for it... I think
[0:46:11] lellandria: a year and a half of digs is getting old tbh
[0:46:16] Caladin_the_Paladin: I don't dig the digs either.
[0:46:36] doomer_dan_: The vendor prices on the dig rewards are wildly too high
[0:46:54] Rico_Azzarash: @Nulgar What? Who? WHERE?
[0:46:54] fleks27: i usually do all the more world content style things in downtime but i skipped this one
[0:46:57] neverbornlucky: tALIESIN OMG DON'T  check wow news today THERE is no news
[0:47:06] Nulgar: @Rico_Azzarash over there!
[0:48:18] vague_pumpkin: no
[0:48:27] Nulgar: yes
[0:48:35] Nulgar: no wait no
[0:48:36] caradosailanthus: I like doing things on alts, so I am rarely bothered by so-called content droughts
[0:48:37] In_Ex_Fan: Heyo, just wanted to say thanks for the giftie!
[0:48:40] Nulgar: well, let's wait for the options
[0:48:52] Metket: when wow goes for BFA, SL territory when it comes to patches it gets concerning / boring
[0:48:53] cabeshpash: @Harper_n7 the new content that was released In 10.2.5, which are repeatable quests where you dig up artifacts
[0:49:14] YayFiber: Just knowing when things are coming is fine enough, imo.

[0:49:36] Coshisan: well you need to click vote also :) not only choose on the poll
[0:49:37] Rico_Azzarash: I just like to interrupt you  SORRY XDDD
[0:49:42] morbid0ne: Omg, @rico_azzarash is baller
[0:49:54] Kydar: @bottis96 maybe hotfixes? I'm not sure
[0:50:03] kittysnugglez: We still discussing this dead game?
[0:50:05] patrickfitzsimmons: Unless 10.26 is on the level of something like player housing it will be hammered by a lot of people. They dragged it out to long with no information.
[0:50:09] 1NessaToday: We just shouldnt do a surprise drop at the tail end of en expac. In the middle or beginning this would be fine
[0:50:12] Sorin__: I think they had an unexpected delay which prevented us getting a date
[0:50:21] XCherryBombX: this makes season 4 feel even farther away
[0:50:22] morbid0ne: @kittysnugglez lol, it is far from dead
[0:50:24] yuumleague: <3
[0:50:27] cyclopsnerd: this dead game is my favorite game
[0:50:29] alextheblight: I just saw "release date" and picked that
[0:50:29] Rico_Azzarash: It's Rico... the boy who will never get mana buff from you if you'll have one xDDD

[0:50:46] cabeshpash: lmaooo
[0:50:47] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel you prejudiced the chat! You laid out your opening argument!
[0:50:47] kittysnugglez: Lol Asmon hasn't been streaming wow jokes on you
[0:50:49] grimblymcgoo: @kittysnugglez Asmon does not dictate what happens to a game
[0:50:52] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I heard Asmongold has a new react video too you
[0:50:52] ParzTV81: lol rekt
[0:50:54] chryseis: Gottem
[0:50:54] TheDeekins: @TaliesinAndEvitel I think making all the 10.1 world stuff irrelevant had a surprisingly big impact; the ED stuff is boring and there's less to do in 10.2 than in 10.1
[0:50:59] Warbeast78: Tali is trying to have 5 videos on his content
[0:51:04] Kydar: @kittysnugglez that's the point
[0:51:07] Nulgar: Nulgar gifted a Tier 1 sub to kittysnugglez! They have given 232 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:51:13] apheelia96: @kittysnugglez hes not streaming it but he trashes it on the regular
[0:51:28] AlanC2024: honestly this could be a test of if they could keep a patch under wraps and no leaks so when they do a future patch they can have stuff we know about and things we dont
[0:51:28] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel if you're going to lay out arguments, you need your fancy barristers wig
[0:51:30] kittysnugglez: Yeah who doesn't trash on it lol. Dead game
[0:51:47] jhopps12: @kittysnugglez I don't :)
[0:51:48] Nulgar: @kittysnugglez 1. you'll now have the emotes for a month tneEvi 2. you ensured that T&E got money, and 3. you'll be reminded in a month about this tneTali
[0:51:50] apheelia96: I dont trash it because I enjoy the game
[0:52:00] kittiezZ_: tneEvi

[0:52:26] neverbornlucky: Taliesin where is the F u poll ?
[0:52:34] Eregbueye: If I had no hype for it to begin with what do I press :D
[0:52:38] eyeoin: is there generally any hype for a .6 patch anyway
[0:52:46] Metket: @TaliesinAndEvitel true question is always should be like this: people lost hype after announcement of next exp for the remaining of the current exp or not
[0:52:50] Nulgar: aw shucks
[0:52:52] Rico_Azzarash: Wait... Where is an option "were never hyped?" D":  I feel excluded
[0:52:55] showerbees: Sick Malcom in the Middle reference
[0:53:01] chlorophyllkid: is there a season 4 announcement?
[0:53:01] Thowarr: I didn't have any hype for this .6 patch; waiting for the next expac honestly
[0:53:03] jhopps12: your youtube videos have been super great recently! @TaliesinAndEvitel
[0:53:04] kittiezZ_: @eyeoin right??? wheres 10.3 :p

[0:53:40] redbubs1: Im so hyped illbe hyped for the rest of us
[0:53:59] sebggg: I'm more hyped for this patch than any patch in recent memory
[0:54:05] kittysnugglez: If only Blizzard gave a shit about passionate wow communities like this. Instead they farm your sub money and abuse your undying hope that the game doesn't suck.
[0:54:12] redbubs1: The pirate flag patch will redeem gilneas patch
[0:54:16] ropergaran: I wasn't hyped for 10.2.6 to begin with, so I didn't have anything to lose
[0:54:18] cabeshpash: who nightsquall?
[0:54:29] siegeorc: I think I‚Äôve had a generalized gamer burnout and want some grass to touch more often, but when it goes out I‚Äôll probably play a bunch of the patch
[0:54:44] eyeoin: @TaliesinAndEvitel is there generally hype for non x.x.5/.0 patches?
[0:54:49] morbid0ne: @kittysnugglez Ah, hyperbolic statements. Nice rage bait.
[0:54:50] TheAsteryon: I don't get hype for the micro patches
[0:54:51] Caladin_the_Paladin: @kittysnugglez Damn. Who shit in your Cheerios this morning?
[0:55:00] TankenFunk: Trans media? TransgenderPride
[0:55:01] showerbees: S4 m+ just dungeons with pirates
[0:55:02] cabeshpash: yeah cryptic teasers might've worked
[0:55:05] TankenFunk: sign me up
[0:55:07] grimblymcgoo: Transmedia? WOKE STREAMER
[0:55:13] redbubs1: They would never oversell and underdeliver
[0:55:14] neverbornlucky: I thought taliesin was asking if we lost height
[0:55:14] caradosailanthus: Just don't hype things until they are very close to ready
[0:55:31] Nulgar: Quick Poll: Is Season of Discovery setting up Retail story "Trans Media"? frogmu1Hehe
[0:55:32] dright424: For me its more 10.2.5 failed to keep the hype
[0:55:34] crowzeyy: i'm trying to use my prime sub, it's available but no button for it?? anyone know how to fix
[0:55:40] liveshowfieldy: oh yeah I 100% agree, there‚Äôs definitely a reason for all the background lore scattered throughout DF on him, would be weird if it was just arbitrary and for nothing
[0:55:44] seanstrachan: Yeah like tweeting cryptic images, both from in-game and just random shit to give us hints to fuel speculation
[0:55:45] bettys_dungeon_adventures: i think you can only edge someone for so long before they lose interest. a release date might have helped but its just taken too long
[0:55:56] kittysnugglez: The game is great can't deny it.
[0:56:00] Rico_Azzarash: WAIT! Shadowlands was S TIER!!!
[0:56:01] kittysnugglez: Just dead
[0:56:19] morbid0ne: Lol, okay
[0:56:20] Caladin_the_Paladin: @Rico_Azzarash If "S" stands for "Sucked", than I agree.
[0:56:26] Caladin_the_Paladin: *then
[0:56:31] X_barley: X_barley subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Went on a Dan Olson binge after that podcast, he's really fucking cool man I love his wow opinions, especially about that amirdrassil quest with the npcs in the world
[0:56:32] Thowarr: "S" = shyte tier
[0:56:33] brandorkian: except lore
[0:56:38] Nulgar: @Rico_Azzarash ok now I'm torn, because I usually shit on the term "S Tier" for meaning "shit tier" tneEvi
[0:56:43] brandorkian: shadowlands lore is oof
[0:56:48] SwordCannonn: PokPikachu
[0:56:49] d0mezg4mer: don't really know what is gained by insisting the game is dead
[0:56:54] caradosailanthus: I'll be curious to see if they redesign Wildstalker Druid Hero Talents, because they are getting terrible reviews
[0:57:03] Caladin_the_Paladin: @d0mezg4mer Edgelord credits.
[0:57:05] Rico_Azzarash: Ahahahahah XD
[0:57:07] alextheblight: /golfclap
[0:57:07] kittysnugglez: Id love to see wow grow into the legend it once was. Kinda feeling like the hope is lost
[0:57:08] knightjudicator: dammit Tali
[0:57:08] xantoor: BOOOO to that joke
[0:57:11] crowzeyy: crowzeyy subscribed with Prime. 
[0:57:12] xantoor: BOO THIS MAN
[0:57:12] madmerco: Here he comes Squalling down the street making pirate noises to everyone he meets. hey hey he's a pirate!
[0:57:18] X_barley: fucked up you know we dont know the alphabet
[0:57:31] morbid0ne: @d0mezg4mer He wants to bait Tali
[0:57:45] Thowarr: @caradosailanthus so is the Balance/Resto hero talents; I guess they're not doing a balance/feral hero talent set? sadge
[0:57:48] bladestitch: I can't believe that people still don't get the joke.
[0:58:00] crowzeyy: fluttLove
[0:58:00] Kydar: @madmerco Clap Clap Clap
[0:58:05] redbubs1: Wow and xbox will come soon tm
[0:58:30] Alienduck2: As far as gameplay goes, shadowlands is exactly the same as dragonflight. In fact, I'd go so far as to say Shadowlands had better raid fights. Amirdrassil fights are boring. M+ is better in dragonflight only because there's more diversity.
[0:58:42] Sorin__: There are way more long lived games now, lots more competition
[0:58:58] yuumleague: your transmog is beautiful :)
[0:59:00] Nulgar: Corgo100 saw an interesting take earlier: those 10 million weren't all consistent subscribers, people came and went, and the numbers were high because the game was still new and hyped by everyone
[0:59:02] Thowarr: @TaliesinAndEvitel I think you've spoken of this before, but is WoW overall too hard to get into? Learning systems, classes, as well as trying to follow lore (if that's their thing)?
[0:59:07] X_barley: It's interesting having never played during that generational peak cause I genuinely have never felt like the playerbase was lacking in anyway
[0:59:08] knightjudicator: @Alienduck2 SL gameplay inherently included covenants which were a pain to swap around. DF doesnt have that issue
[0:59:31] kittysnugglez: At what point do we accept that wow is obsolete and we move on to different, bigger things?
[0:59:32] monkey_d_luffy933: monkey_d_luffy933 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:59:34] apheelia96: duckJam
[0:59:43] Nulgar: after all, some time later we heard that over 100 million accounts had been created
[0:59:56] Thowarr: @kittysnugglez when both the active and private servers are all dead, with the heat death of the universe
[0:59:58] Ysarahhh: @kittysnugglez theres nothing stopping you leaving, why do we have to lol
[1:00:01] doomer_dan_: i'm chooing WoD everytime. best expac
[1:00:12] seanstrachan: @kittysnugglez pretty doomer of you
[1:00:13] caradosailanthus: Get on a low pop RP server with WM on and get out in the world.  Almost a Single Player game
[1:00:19] fleks27: its also reset day and lots of people may raid or do m+
[1:00:23] redbubs1: Why did wow videos crater so hard after bfa and sl
[1:00:28] X_barley: self induced constrictions
[1:00:32] Alkey29: yea.. my guild has concluded their raid progression until season 4.
[1:00:34] morbid0ne: @kittysnugglez You, you mean? That's up to you, isn't it.
[1:00:37] Nulgar: @caradosailanthus yeah but that's always been the case tneEvi
[1:00:40] X_barley: rp servers are separated on purpose
[1:00:42] Saiyori: this just in, water is wet
[1:00:44] Durwen: I haven't been able to log in... The game's been updating for quite some time now
[1:00:45] Caladin_the_Paladin: Who could've had anticipated it would work that way? LUL
[1:00:46] Metket: argent dawn would be more crowded if they didn't lose population to AYAYAYA final fantasy
[1:00:47] wastedxtime93: WHAAAAAAAAAAA
[1:00:52] FatCatDad48: In other news: Fire, still hot
[1:00:53] yelreah: no way thats crazy
[1:00:56] Beertrain2k: Lol pop server = Low pop ??? MIND BLOWN...
[1:00:56] saarkhastick: Holy shit is that what low pop means???
[1:01:06] jhopps12: new YT thumbnail right there!
[1:01:07] Alkey29: do you like to visit goldshire on moonguard ?  its still very popular :)
[1:01:08] kittiezZ_: tneEvi tneEvi
[1:01:09] Saiyori: new thumbnail pic right there
[1:01:12] wastedxtime93: Shocked Pikachu*
[1:01:13] morbid0ne: Lolol
[1:01:16] Alienduck2: @knightjudicator That was really only an issue for the highest levels of gameplay. Doing +15s and heroic raid you did not need to worry about swapping covs.
[1:01:17] Caladin_the_Paladin: LUL
[1:01:17] crowzeyy: LUL
[1:01:17] neverbornlucky: Taiesin they are in wow SOD
[1:01:19] HolocronCoder: But Tali, if you combine all of the options that minimize other people in the game, then there are not that many in the game!
[1:01:25] Chrisraijin_: LUL LUL
[1:01:35] Nulgar: @caradosailanthus they LITERALLY (and I mean that literally) bribed people to play on RP-PvP servers during the early expansions already
[1:01:45] wastedxtime93: kekw
[1:01:46] jhopps12: LUL
[1:01:46] Rico_Azzarash: LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:01:47] caradosailanthus: I was already on the server when the pop crashed and I have no intention to leave my IRL friends and in game friends on the server
[1:01:50] jeldin: ruthless
[1:01:50] Aelissia: lol
[1:01:52] morbid0ne: Omg, I hate click bait thumbnails
[1:01:53] 1NessaToday: But if the game wasnt dead there souldnt be low pop servers tneAni
[1:01:54] siegeorc: tneEvi tneEvi tneEvi
[1:01:55] Shrandamar: lol
[1:01:55] Nimsh: tneKragwa
[1:02:00] hyzenthlays: that guy from pans labyrinth?
[1:02:04] Thoreya: sod was so dead they had to buff leveling a phase ahead lol
[1:02:04] vlaovich88: If I walk into an instance, without a group, there is literally noone around. This game sucks!!!!
[1:02:13] Thoreya: they dropped 75% players in phase 2
[1:02:37] neverbornlucky: Taliesin where are the wow SOD players? Dead game
[1:02:41] databob1: kraken194CanaryPanic1 tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE tneMovEEE
[1:02:43] redbubs1: Fake news
[1:02:44] S3N71: Good afternoon Talie.  Congrats on 5 year Partnerversary
[1:02:48] kittysnugglez: Dead game foreal lol
[1:02:59] dergNwolf: can't believe game kaputt
[1:03:01] ArcaneSyntax: tbh SoD is a lot more boring in phase 2
[1:03:01] showerbees: I‚Äôm in the raid  rn
[1:03:05] redbubs1: Classic owning retail
[1:03:09] kittysnugglez: Bunch of people sitting in valdrakken lobby simulator waiting for mythic plus groups to take em
[1:03:15] d0mezg4mer: there's no public info on sub numbers so any talk of "dead" or "drop in phase 2" is just made up from thin air
[1:03:19] lellandria: My house is dead, only me here
[1:03:24] all_beef_franks: SoD players are just the bots
[1:03:27] Alienduck2: Playing sod last night and walking through the barrens, I saw THREE people on a full server. Dead game.
[1:03:29] kittysnugglez: Standing in valdrakken doing nothing = not dead
[1:03:34] kinslayerneko: ya know, I liked azerite gear üôÇ
[1:03:37] morbid0ne: I love how you were saying you were enjoying the positivity in this stream and suddenly this twat shows up
[1:03:42] databob1: @lellandria mine too
[1:03:46] grimblymcgoo: @redbubs1 Where the hell are you getting your numbers? Blizz doesnt release them and its the same sub. The smoothness of your brain is showing
[1:03:46] Thoreya: @kittysnugglez u do realize theres 9 expansions where players can be right
[1:03:56] ArcaneSyntax: SoD phase one didn't even have more players than retail.
[1:03:56] Thoreya: not just one city
[1:03:58] eyeoin: @ArcaneSyntax why? its pretty much the same. I essentially main sod at this point, only difference is less of a grind in STV compared to ashen
[1:04:02] jimbowheat: @kittysnugglez people have been standing around in cities since Vanilla. It's half the game!
[1:04:11] TankenFunk: *presents anecdotal evidence* "As you can see from the statistics I presented"
[1:04:12] Alienduck2: @kinslayerneko talents with extra steps. Essences were cool tho.
[1:04:17] seanstrachan: @kittysnugglez why are you here if you're just going to constantly be negative? Find something else to enjoy maybe?
[1:04:20] chryseis: Same thing how more people will read the first book in a trilogy rather than the whole series. Like, statistically.
[1:04:27] lonesomecowboy: this season was hard goated i really hope they don't listen to the MDI andys who say this season has been bad it's been so so so so good for like 15-22 key civilians like me lol
[1:04:27] bladestitch: The people that nitpicks about how many player there is would just whinge about something else if player levels climbed.
[1:04:28] kittysnugglez: Valdrakken cough cough I mean lobby simulator
[1:04:32] ArcaneSyntax: @eyeoin it just wasn't as fun idk, none of my friends are playing
[1:04:47] Alkey29: what is the raid for season 4?
[1:04:51] Thoreya: @eyeoin bc theres nothing to do
[1:04:54] kinslayerneko: @Alienduck2 the abilities they gave you were more generalized than talents, like lightning crashes and bleeds regardless of class.
[1:04:54] Metket: raid was better, outdoor world was better in s3 then s2 so
[1:04:59] figgenbaum: unless theres a sex scene
[1:05:09] morbid0ne: I love how you were saying you were enjoying the positivity in this stream and suddenly this twat shows up
[1:05:18] TheAsteryon: kind of blows not getting a new raid for s4
[1:05:22] eyeoin: @Thoreya what was there to do in season 1 comparatively is what i'm asking. It's a very similar content arc.
[1:05:30] kittysnugglez: Holy shit there's a whole 25 people standing in valdrakken mid day doing nothing game definitely isn't dead KEK
[1:05:30] Alkey29: was the fated season in shadowlands rehashed raids?
[1:05:30] jimbowheat: Max from Liquid was talking yesterday as if he knows something about the new raid tier and he said its really good.
[1:05:32] seanstrachan: @taliesinandevitel did you hear Avatar is getting 2 more seasons?
[1:05:37] bladestitch: Have you watched One Piece yet?
[1:05:39] thunduz: thunduz subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 50 months, currently on a 50 month streak! took the family on vacation but I couldn‚Äôt miss my 50 month streak so you have me for this split second of celebration. much love to T&E!
[1:05:42] morbid0ne: Well, that's good
[1:05:46] kinslayerneko: on top of that I like the grind for god rolls on armor and weapons
[1:05:48] Nulgar: @morbid0ne they wait until you say something positive and then try to shit on it
[1:05:50] hyzenthlays: @kittysnugglez go snuggle a kitty or something mate
[1:05:51] neverbornlucky: Clip it Chat Taliesin admits he is taking blue chewy
[1:06:08] thunduz: tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes tneMovEviHeartEyes
[1:06:13] all_beef_franks: WoW is so dead, the streams lately are just family guy
[1:06:15] liveshowfieldy: you happened to given last epoch a try by any chance?
[1:06:26] TankenFunk: Not 50 month sub yet, not a friend :(
[1:06:35] apheelia96: bad for ur heart though
[1:06:37] Eregbueye: eregbuLife
[1:06:40] Alienduck2: @Alkey29 Weekly rotation of the expansion's raid, yes. S4 of DF likely to be the same.
[1:06:45] kittysnugglez: Guys there a whole 25 people standing around doing nothing in the main city on a high pop server mid day. Game isn't dead!
[1:06:46] figgenbaum: dont mind the dust on them
[1:06:53] gryffiest: unless it was in front of your teenage neighbor lol!
[1:06:54] kiewies: I just tuned in dear goodness
[1:06:55] apheelia96: oh hell no what ever works
[1:07:02] morbid0ne: This guy is an idiot
[1:07:03] yelreah: ill be honest seeing wow get called dead is a bit silly to me like im 22 and been playing wow since i was SEVEN and ive heard ppl call it dead like every expansion im p sure üò≠
[1:07:07] MrAxeffect: its raid time
[1:07:10] thunduz: back to family time. have fun all!
[1:07:12] Lenitas: Also phasing is a thing
[1:07:22] 1NessaToday: You can clearly see the game is dead!!!!!111!!!
[1:07:24] Harper_n7: More people than I ever saw in Oribos LUL
[1:07:24] kittysnugglez: I'm just a wow hater don't mind me
[1:07:36] gryffiest: clearly kitty
[1:07:39] seanstrachan: This Kittysnugglez is just looking for attention clearly
[1:07:42] Beertrain2k: @kittysnugglez Easy.
[1:07:46] bladestitch: Why is that?
[1:07:47] kittysnugglez: I mean, I got it so.
[1:07:48] Alienduck2: @yelreah If a video game can't sustain Fortnite numbers for a decade, obviously it's a dead game because infinite upward momentum is the goal in capitalism
[1:07:54] eyeoin: I think it looks pretty lively
[1:07:58] all_beef_franks: is your guild still raiding weekly?
[1:08:01] Alkey29: ohh @Alienduck2 ,   would the bosses mechanics change?  wouldnt ppl clear it out faster since everyone's familiar with the boss mechanics?
[1:08:01] neverbornlucky: Taliesin explain the point of a roleplay server ?
[1:08:06] chryseis: Yeah, I don't rp but I adore WrA
[1:08:20] kinslayerneko: Azerite gear had so much more potential
[1:08:24] morbid0ne: So, an idiot
[1:08:24] Nulgar: @kittysnugglez imagine how many more are out in the world
[1:08:27] TheDeekins: not only that, but less content than in 10.1 since we're missing .5 and .7 content
[1:08:32] Metket: there are rp servers and there is Argent dawn
[1:08:44] atamala: ah more immersive, like "Got Milk"
[1:08:48] ArcaneSyntax: no characters named "hotdogswallower"
[1:08:49] saarkhastick: Are you saying my name wouldn't work?
[1:08:49] TheDeekins: I was running multiple alts and had plenty to do in 10.1, now I just raid log because ED activities are boring
[1:08:51] KanaCiCi: :)
[1:08:52] kittysnugglez: Nobody goes out in the world lol. Everyone sits in valdrakken waiting for queue
[1:08:52] Lenitas: I also love walking into random RP going on
[1:08:55] cyclopsnerd: pvper names
[1:09:03] weapon000: noobkiller 23
[1:09:03] knightjudicator: RP servers best servers IME
[1:09:08] atamala: other than these guild names lol
[1:09:14] Lenitas: Especially with release of Belthamel was a bunch of it going on there
[1:09:21] liveshowfieldy: @all_beef_franks we got 4/9M but have had dropouts so taken a break while we recruit
[1:09:22] eyeoin: Moonguard rp unironically is super cool once you get past goldshire
[1:09:29] redbubs1: What is there to do on rp servers than erp
[1:09:31] bladestitch: Been using the time to farm mounts. Got myself Invincible and Kor'kron. :)
[1:09:31] ArcaneSyntax: no "glizzyguzzy" character names
[1:09:38] Alienduck2: @Alkey29 Yes and no. There were affixes like in mythic plus that made the raid slightly more interesting, but there wasnt anything new added to individual fights.
[1:09:39] goatviolence: I didn't truly enjoy the game until I was on an RP server
[1:09:42] databob1: I got mocked in an lfr dungeon for being on an rp server
[1:09:50] Harper_n7: Are you saying I can't be a cum slut on an RP server? That's not what I've heard about the Goldshire Inn...
[1:09:51] kittysnugglez: RP servers are for thirsty virgins with weird fetishes
[1:10:17] Metket: and the good thing is if you write Citizens of dalaran in chat you will see how good it is
[1:10:20] Harper_n7: @kittysnugglez What a wildly bad take....
[1:10:37] crowzeyy: @kittysnugglez you obviously just hear someone say something and make that your whole opinion on things LUL
[1:10:37] morbid0ne: @kittysnugglez Clearly you don't play this game. Ever seen what a Superbloom is like?
[1:10:40] Beertrain2k: OOOOP
[1:10:40] hyzenthlays: Gotteem
[1:10:41] riffraff005: :D

[1:11:01] kittysnugglez: Kek thinks he gotten
[1:11:04] neverbornlucky: Taliesin I thought  RP servers were only for people who wanted to do things underwater in certain city places
[1:11:05] sedated421: lonerb1Peepotype
[1:11:09] Disjoint_Dwarf: As a solo player, RP servers are better for the focusing on story and immersion
[1:11:11] Harper_n7: Spring's definitely coming early with that heat
[1:11:24] kittysnugglez: Trolling? I'm spewing my honest thoughts kek
[1:11:26] Caladin_the_Paladin: Dead troll.
[1:11:36] jhopps12: your trolling game is dead LUL
[1:11:44] morbid0ne: @taliesinandevitel Go to Amirdrassil and show this wank the Superbloom
[1:11:50] morbid0ne: Lol, dead troll

[1:12:17] Caladin_the_Paladin: They think they're that important? LUL
[1:12:19] TheDeekins: I might trikS
[1:12:20] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can I name my character leftnut and rightnut on roleplay server?
[1:12:27] Eregbueye: @kittysnugglez why are you on a wow stream then lol
[1:12:33] teldariol: teldariol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! 
[1:12:33] Harper_n7: @kittysnugglez Yet you're in a Twitch chat for a game with a sub that is like 20 years old from Blizzard...
[1:12:35] bladestitch: More fun to laugh at him. :P
[1:12:37] knightjudicator: Left Knut
[1:12:39] bigoldmeatpie: we're witnessing someone with a shame kink in chat
[1:12:39] atamala: oh ban me next! ban me!
[1:12:49] ramzie0: @neverbornlucky you might get reported 3.5 seconds after zoning in
[1:12:55] Caladin_the_Paladin: Ban me harder, zaddy!
[1:12:57] liveshowfieldy: imagine saying kek unironically
[1:12:59] Disjoint_Dwarf: Banning trolls would give them too much satisfaction - keep edging them
[1:13:13] ArcaneSyntax: no more masochism, only sadism
[1:13:13] sedated421: BOP smash me with a ban hammer daddy ban me daddy
[1:13:16] alextheblight: you might get reported into a namechange since people don't like 'non-rp' names on rp servers
[1:13:17] bladestitch: Look how buthurt he is.
[1:13:21] morbid0ne: It's pretty obvious
[1:13:21] liveshowfieldy: @kittysnugglez this is why you have horrible luck with women
[1:13:26] alextheblight: ah beaten to it
[1:13:38] goatviolence: @alextheblight nah people are usually pretty chill
[1:13:39] alextheblight: I understood it. I love that musical

[1:13:43] Disjoint_Dwarf: Do iiiiiiiiiit
[1:13:47] Volkien: I know why you play disc priest now, talie. You never mentioned the changes and how broken they made disc. I ksmed 4 toons before I knew that.
[1:13:52] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can I go as a night elf on a role play server and ask the horde to burn some more trees plz
[1:13:53] bladestitch: My brother had a character called KoenigSAAB.
[1:13:55] Thoreya: @kittysnugglez u spewed how much u dont like the game for 20 minutes. how much do you wanna tell us u dont like the game?

[1:14:12] eyeoin: I dont even know what im hoping for...but not that
[1:14:15] Lenitas: Haste though
[1:14:22] Thowarr: I guess that explains why I need blue pills already; Thanks @TaliesinAndEvitel dad!

[1:19:02] alextheblight: your dk being a belf reminded amirdrassil tier dk helmet's mouth doesn't move on belves :(
[1:19:08] kaijoe_: Just like Blizz's Titan project, this Titanborne is also cancelled.
[1:19:11] alextheblight: reminded me*
[1:19:13] jimbowheat: going for the third account probably!
[1:19:16] yelreah: he needs to spell out the message give him a sec
[1:19:20] MikeyGy: that dk set is so so sexy damn
[1:19:21] kinslayerneko: Stare wtf
[1:19:22] Harper_n7: @jimbowheat beat me to it lol
[1:19:23] Beertrain2k: 2/2 Completed.
[1:19:24] bettys_dungeon_adventures: @jimbowheat i was just thinking that
[1:19:25] MilkEggsFabricSoftener: The Last Titan(born)
[1:19:46] showerbees: might not be the typing speed if you know what I mean
[1:19:47] Thoreya: why
[1:19:47] bladestitch: Whats his third name gonna be hm...
[1:19:48] vlaovich88: tneTrundleMaldini
[1:19:49] kaijoe_: That tier is so good
[1:19:50] Thoreya: what was wrong with panda
[1:19:51] hyzenthlays: he looks sick tho
[1:19:53] dergNwolf: WHYYYYY
[1:19:53] Sch1ey: Boooo
[1:19:54] crowzeyy: the sick xmog makes up for it
[1:19:55] dergNwolf: tippiCry
[1:19:56] alextheblight: hmm
[1:19:58] Eregbueye: BibleThump panda
[1:19:59] X_barley: SETTLE ON A RACE FOR THIS GUY
[1:20:01] brian_777777777: yep
[1:20:02] Beertrain2k: Not a panda ??? "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU !!"
[1:20:04] databob1: @taliesinandevitel that is a metal DK
[1:20:10] cyclopsnerd: you'll regret it when pandas get their heritage set in 2039 :(
[1:20:13] X_barley: back to Draenei in a month
[1:20:17] alextheblight: my dk is a belf too, but at what cost?
[1:20:17] Sygorian: Your draenei was also baller
[1:20:19] dergNwolf: you were the chosen one phillieSad
[1:20:23] peacefrog04: Panda's look derpy
[1:20:29] Thoreya: female pandas look cool tho
[1:20:37] bettys_dungeon_adventures: pandas look too goofy to be DKs LUL
[1:20:43] Thoreya: they have good melee animations
[1:20:44] nezzynerdz: The panda stance though!! is it really worht??
[1:20:58] morbid0ne: They bounce and plate doesn't look great on them imo
[1:20:58] RosieSeren: think panda models might need a soft update, looking a little older in comparison now
[1:21:00] alextheblight: I like pandas, but the stretchy textures on gear is eh
[1:21:03] X_barley: Is the headcannon that he cant stay in one body?
[1:21:04] funviking99: KomodoHype
[1:21:12] dergNwolf: but there already are too many male blood elves in the game
[1:21:13] dergNwolf: phillieSad
[1:21:17] yuumleague: he was a mechagnome ? D:
[1:21:23] In_Ex_Fan: Did you also faction change with this DK?
[1:21:30] MikeyGy: he's actualy a changeling
[1:21:46] Nulgar: I wonder where people get the Pedo theory from - I keep asking whenever it gets brought up on Reddit etc., but never get any replies, so it's probably just something some disingenous streamer said
[1:21:59] bladestitch: Want to boost a mage but can't decide what race I should have for it.
[1:22:01] alextheblight: poggers
[1:22:39] morbid0ne: Ah yes, an obviously hetero male with a beautiful and intelligent wife with two kids is a pedo. That's sound logic...
[1:22:45] Lenitas: Haste mastery does feel nice on Blood DK
[1:22:50] alextheblight: yikes...
[1:22:56] kittiezZ_: i havent read anything like that but
[1:22:56] caradosailanthus: It's become the default insult
[1:22:56] hyzenthlays: projection?
[1:22:57] liveshowfieldy: @bladestitch dwarf if you‚Äôre going fire for the increase to crit damage
[1:23:00] jimbowheat: Never heard that before!
[1:23:13] RosieSeren: think it might be one of those "the call is coming from inside the house" type things
[1:23:13] bettys_dungeon_adventures: i havent heard that either
[1:23:19] morbid0ne: I've never heard that, myself either.
[1:23:19] wickedjesther: must the all the gnome rolepay on BG3
[1:23:21] Nulgar: yeah that makes sense
[1:23:25] Sygorian: Everyone that leans left is a pedo, didnt you know
[1:23:26] alextheblight: shows I hang out in the right places since I've never heard that
[1:23:27] Nulgar: typical maga bullshit
[1:23:27] bladestitch: It's not like any of the people that use that word ever care about the welfare of kids.
[1:23:33] floatinging: almost certainly
[1:23:33] Sch1ey: Yes
[1:23:35] eyeoin: its probably just something from the right's bag or insults
[1:23:40] Nimsh: maybe someone just saw the beard and thought you were rolf harris
[1:23:46] funviking99: Kappa
[1:23:50] sedated421: TransgenderPride
[1:24:14] databob1: @taliesinandevitel yeah that really popular on the American right at this time
[1:24:18] TankenFunk: Transmog? In MY DUDEBRO world of WARcraft?!?!
[1:24:36] Metket: and ofc you forget it
[1:24:38] yuumleague: you will forget about it

[1:26:28] X_barley: Are you going for axe on him?
[1:26:30] ramzie0: I do not understand how the catalyst thing works
[1:26:31] alextheblight: death metal Skeletor colors
[1:26:37] bladestitch: I might soon get a new job with much higher salary. One of the first thing I intend to do is to sub. :)
[1:26:40] liveshowfieldy: the PvP elite one looks amazing
[1:27:11] Rico_Azzarash: Tali. We are doing guild heroic leggo farm
[1:27:30] alextheblight: @ramzie0 you put a piece of non-tier gear (has to be "champion" quality at minimum, iirc) into it and it becomes a tier piece
[1:27:40] Rico_Azzarash: Maybe you can join on DK ?
[1:28:15] Nulgar: with the way upgrades help you unlock the next higher appearance during the season, I reailly wish for something afterwards, too. Like, if you got a mythic raid drop, you also unlock the heroic, normal and LFR appearance.
[1:28:36] Rico_Azzarash: I guess it will happen tomorrow
[1:28:44] DarthTaz0: @alextheblight you can put veteran gear in too
[1:28:47] ramzie0: @alextheblight Oh. It's that simple? wow I feel dumb, lol
[1:29:27] Harsbo: Is this a DK with a vampire fantasy
[1:29:31] Harsbo: ?
[1:29:33] Saiyori: that's on the belt!? I thought that was on the pants that's wild
[1:29:43] alextheblight: @DarthTaz0 right, thank you. Been a while since I used it
[1:29:49] ramzie0: I love that the white SL legendary items give the Mythic SoD appearances
[1:29:50] alextheblight: Skeletor fantasy*
[1:30:52] TheDeekins: I started playing in BFA for the first time since WOTLK and I was so confused and sad at the absence of tier sets
[1:31:02] hyzenthlays: what's for dinner?
[1:31:09] X_barley: good video
[1:31:15] Saiyori: I actually liked the transmog not being tier because it themed after the raids, but I recognize that is /not/ a popular opinion Now if they did it like Vault of the Incarnates, I'm totally fine with it bc it's still raid-themed
[1:31:24] Harsbo: I saw it. Xalatath is in it. 10/10
[1:31:30] X_barley: Putting story in classic motivates me to actually want to play it
[1:31:32] emarol_dk: I love that you are doing weekly reset every week , allways look forward to it :)
[1:31:36] brian_777777777: yes i love your video
[1:31:44] Arlaeya: Oh yeah it's great! I won't start a new character to play SoD, but I love that it's there
[1:31:53] bomayaa: found your vid fascinating as I don't play SOD so had no idea
[1:32:04] X_barley: Do they want more classic players to jump to retail?
[1:32:09] Frazael: 12 raiders from Frazael have joined! 
[1:32:13] Honorbound94: Honorbound94 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 43 months with the best streamers on Twitch and everywhere else. Hope you, Evi, and the kids are doing well!
[1:32:33] bladestitch: Do you like suggestions for events happening in UK or is that something you prefer we don't give? Just asking since it's about storytelling.
[1:32:51] Frazael: Hey Taliiiii frazaeLove
[1:33:10] Nulgar: Xal'atath in SoD? Trans media! /s
[1:33:16] bladestitch: Yes, oral storytelling festival.
[1:33:22] X_barley: Tali's gonna get a BAFTA invite from chat üëÄ
[1:33:32] alextheblight: Xal'atath said trans rights PrideTrans
[1:33:54] grimblymcgoo: Primal?? Order??
[1:33:56] Theorof: About player housing, do you think it's going to be freely opened to all players, or will we have to do something to get the
[1:34:02] 1NessaToday: "write that little seqment" that was half of the vid, lol
[1:34:19] Theorof: Most basic one
[1:34:43] seanstrachan: Would help to be on your priest

[1:34:58] Disjoint_Dwarf: Well a Vanilla lore book says there are 5 old gods - opinions Tali?
[1:35:00] Kydar: you're not on a priest
[1:35:06] seanstrachan: And a dk
[1:35:07] GameingAspect: also not a preist
[1:35:10] Metket: LMAO
[1:35:13] alextheblight: LUL
[1:35:15] seanstrachan: Hahaha
[1:35:18] bomayaa: hahaha

[1:36:01] Ryylar: got it lol
[1:36:04] X_barley: youtube he fucked up, people on youtube just to say, he fucked up
[1:36:38] bladestitch: Has kitty returned to be laughed at?
[1:36:42] bigoldmeatpie: i miss the order halls so much
[1:36:52] In_Ex_Fan: I hope youtube will remember how tali totally wanted to go to the priest order hall with his DK, cause he doesn't care for them rules.
[1:36:52] X_barley: Makes me want an Evoker hall now
[1:37:24] Nusu1828: @thunduz Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:37:39] GameingAspect: consumed by its kin hmmm
[1:37:42] bottis96: YES YES
[1:38:08] alextheblight: I'm still on that too, yeah
[1:38:20] alextheblight: (knaifu is an old god)
[1:39:03] X_barley: Could she be like, an undead old god? We know necromancy can be anything
[1:39:41] cyclopsnerd: that would be a very cool reveal
[1:40:00] Arlaeya: I'm definitely leaning that way now
[1:40:01] alextheblight: old gods are messed up in all kinds of ways, so you never know
[1:40:02] ramzie0: We've been told that Y'Shaarj was 'ripped' from Azeroth by the titans, yeah?
[1:40:32] Connor_Quest: Thats what the Titans told us anyway...
[1:41:07] Ojomon_: I think it takes away from Xalatath as a character if she is/is part of Yshaarj
[1:41:45] GameingAspect: not just the heart?
[1:41:48] ramzie0: @Ojomon_ I agree. I'd like to see knaifu be a new unique entity with agency
[1:41:57] Travnar: @Ojomon_ agreed
[1:42:27] showerbees: Xalatath seems to operate a lot differently than we‚Äôre used to seeing old gods no?
[1:42:32] ramzie0: doesn't the heart talk to you in Siege of Org?
[1:42:42] times_old_roman: His heart did whisper to us afaik. Although that could be different.
[1:43:00] HolocronCoder: If that's what she is, and she went 'home' to the void.. Is it possible that she went back to overthrow the original Void Lords or some other interaction? Since it'd mean she wasn't a Void Lord herself, as your original theory.
[1:43:26] baseboned: why were the old gods at war if they all had the same goal, being sent by the void to corrupt azeroth
[1:43:27] Arlaeya: We never met Ya'shaarj in game. we don't know what they are like
[1:43:39] Arlaeya: they might be exactly like Xal
[1:43:42] morbid0ne: Do we even know Yshaarj is a "he"? It sounds like a feminine name to me ü§î
[1:43:52] draeganfire: @baseboned It's in their chaos nature to war with each other
[1:44:35] bladestitch: Wonder if she's wants to go back to be tentacly or if she's sticking with this body...
[1:44:36] ramzie0: A point to Tali's theory with Xal'atath is that the weapon drop from Siege is called "Xal'atoh" and it whispers to you too
[1:44:42] grimzero617: Tali this last Weekly Reset got me more hyped for TWW than Blizzcon did
[1:44:52] Connor_Quest: @ramzie0 oh thats good
[1:44:53] Travnar: Tangential, but one thing I really enjoyed that Danuser introduced was the Old God's not necessarily being aligned with the Void Lords.
[1:45:06] lil_doreo: "I'be got it right here......."
[1:45:42] DarthTaz0: Every time you call "Rylar" my brain hears "Rylan" and I can't help but think having Rylan as a twitch editor is an odd flex
[1:45:50] alextheblight: oh LUL
[1:46:03] alextheblight: yeah
[1:46:16] alextheblight: (Benedictus)
[1:46:35] ramzie0: I need to level another shadow priest
[1:47:06] aeson_of_raid_sock: she‚Äôs draining men. hallelujah
[1:47:42] X_barley: so what, everyone makes mistakes
[1:47:45] X_barley: I still love her
[1:47:46] Frazael: Maybe she drained N'zoth too, or Galakrond, right?
[1:48:05] SisterblissUK: @aeson_of_raid_sock 4Head
[1:48:07] Saiyori: This is like collecting on investments
[1:48:20] baseboned: Do you think this was intentionally seed planting story points in Legion and BFA? Or just convenient?
[1:48:26] Frazael: And now she is using nerubians to collect the blood of c'thun and yogg
[1:48:33] Jol_jin: well she does say "It's been a while sense she was in a mortal form" so what was she before?
[1:48:34] X_barley: We killed Nzoth because she drained some of him?
[1:48:47] grimzero617: Why are you making this sound so good? Now I'm going to be crushed when it's not true
[1:48:48] BreninUK: how did the blade end up on that alter if the shadowpriests have it?
[1:48:53] X_barley: Can you still do this questline?
[1:48:58] times_old_roman: Oh, and If Yshaarj comes back than that will alert the Titans to return again?
[1:49:13] ramzie0: Xal'atoh
[1:49:29] DunesGames: xalatoes
[1:49:30] Aztecmike: if she's the only artifact to not be used on "that sword" (unless I'm mistaken), do you think there's a connection/reason to that on a lore level?
[1:49:42] showerbees: what would this point to lore-wise if it ends up being true?
[1:49:48] ramzie0: @X_barley yes, you can still do both of these quest lines
[1:49:54] TyndiVelspaz: Xala'this, xala'that, xala'toth
[1:50:06] Travnar: Why are Legion quests so good lol I wish they were the new player experience (maybe with a little less Burning Legion flavor)
[1:50:54] Connor_Quest: What if the old gods were all one old god at one point and that's why they fight
[1:51:00] Connor_Quest: thats the 'fifth'
[1:51:07] X_barley: It helps that Dawn of the infinites was a time travel dungeon and it‚Äôs the one place we‚Äôve seen her directly involved recently
[1:51:10] DaTraS: so she can become the prime ev... eh.. void .. thing?
[1:51:10] ryarose42: If they are the fifth old god it could be fitting that they want to consume those that consumed them originally
[1:51:16] cyclopsnerd: why am I rooting for her :')
[1:51:34] showerbees: she absorbs all of the old gods to reform her original self?
[1:51:59] alextheblight: betrayal.... again!
[1:52:03] HolocronCoder: It's kinda great that people are so ready and excited to be betrayed by Xalatath one way or another
[1:52:11] Frazael: Can you imagine she successfully take the essences of th other old gods and then she goes to aberrus and summon a void lord? THAT is hype
[1:52:17] alextheblight: quel'thalas plays a part, apparently
[1:52:18] Bobndude: i feel like the wow community has kinda just accepted that yasharaj will never show up in game cause thye've been "dead" for so long. what a twist that would be
[1:52:37] Thoreya: midnight is such a fire expac name
[1:52:40] X_barley: It‚Äôs not going to end well for us
[1:52:45] MrAndersen_: whatever story brings the mantid back is the story im hoping for
[1:52:48] ramzie0: @Thoreya it's also going to be 12.0
[1:52:48] Frazael: yup
[1:52:57] Thoreya: @ramzie0 ik. super cool
[1:52:58] Nulgar: bit cringe tbh
[1:52:59] funviking99: also Silvermoon revamped , nice
[1:53:09] Quackster27: @ramzie0 thats cool
[1:53:10] cyclopsnerd: oh snap
[1:53:18] Arlaeya: yuup!
[1:53:37] Disjoint_Dwarf: THE WOOOOOOOONZZZZ CHAMPION
[1:53:42] Eregbueye: VoHiYo yasharash
[1:53:49] Volkien: SO He was connected directly to Azeroth and had titan powers?
[1:53:52] grimzero617: For real? Is this canon?! Is my brain melting?!
[1:53:52] Frazael: hahahaha
[1:53:54] alextheblight: if Y'shaarj shows up I hope he doesn't look like the snake thing like he does in Hearthstone. I want a monstrosity with 7  heads guzuDink
[1:53:55] Vandosz: with that logic couldnt he use Nordrassil instead?
[1:53:58] cyclopsnerd: I really enjoy this theory
[1:53:59] Connor_Quest: He's connected the dots
[1:53:59] bomayaa: bro
[1:54:00] avatos_94: what about nordrassil?
[1:54:01] Heranara: So we're pulling a Kiljaeden out of a old god?
[1:54:07] alextheblight: shows up in WoW*
[1:54:09] showerbees: Wasn‚Äôt the well a source of arcane energy not void?
[1:54:15] the_rethan_family: So could Anveena Teague be an old god?
[1:54:17] jhopps12: Tali, the Blizzard snipers are aiming!  You've cracked the code!
[1:54:17] Metket: are we gonna learn that on 3rd expension though or not? Kappa
[1:54:20] Saiyori: THA WOOOOOUNS
[1:54:48] Thoreya: feel like bfa had a looooot of story for the future of wow
[1:54:50] bigoldmeatpie: so xal'atath for midnight and then she regains her big bad powers and it's y'sharajj for last titan?
[1:54:56] Arlaeya: ...with Amirdrassil existing now, Nordrassil might still be in play
[1:55:00] Volkien: Y'shaarj would have had access to at least Time travel or is amanthul chasing Y'shaarj thru timelines?
[1:55:16] Chrisraijin_: Y'shaarj was "sucking" the arcane there xd
[1:55:16] bangoobangoo: Brother
[1:55:18] X_barley: We also to consider how vulnerable the sunwell is, Alleria stepped near it and it almost collapsed
[1:55:19] times_old_roman: LuL
[1:55:22] TyndiVelspaz: wAT?!
[1:55:24] alextheblight: DansGame
[1:55:25] kittiezZ_: lmao what the heck
[1:55:28] Quackster27: what an example
[1:55:28] brian_777777777: poop blood
[1:55:32] Bobndude: LOL this analogy xD
[1:55:34] Frazael: But why arcane energy tho? It should have been pure azerite coming out of the well
[1:55:40] showerbees: That would make sense turning the highborne into naga after too
[1:55:41] Ryylar: no way this analogy is going in the vid lol
[1:55:42] morbid0ne: Lol
[1:55:44] bigoldmeatpie: so the old gods are giant turds
[1:55:46] bangoobangoo: Probably how Metzen explained it as well, obviously
[1:55:47] showerbees: that makes a lot of sense
[1:55:47] TyndiVelspaz: So Yashiraj is just the corn kernals from a void dookie?
[1:55:47] grimzero617: This took a hard turn lol
[1:55:57] Frazael: yeah exactly
[1:56:15] hitchmeister59: Homeopathic essence storage?
[1:56:19] Heranara: So we took a bucket put some poop water in it used said poop water to make the sunwell and now the bacteria will cause old gods in the sunwell?
[1:56:19] Baconpunch: LuL
[1:56:25] Efendal: maybe the titans cleaned it with a facility there
[1:56:28] Bobndude: DO IT
[1:56:31] Lacee666: then how is azerite looking different from arcane?
[1:56:32] Bobndude: POOP EMOJI
[1:56:38] Heranara: üí©
[1:56:42] liveshowfieldy: I prefer that name to midnight tbh
[1:56:45] the_rethan_family: Is Anveena a poop then?
[1:56:57] theColwal: someone made a really good pointabouttheinteraction betweenAlleria and the Sunwell
[1:56:59] brian_777777777: because magic
[1:57:02] Bobndude: World of Warcraft: Poop in the Water
[1:57:09] showerbees: this is 5head I‚Äôm on board
[1:57:34] Heranara: New Class: Plumber
[1:57:51] highlord1991: this theory makes more sense then jailor stoy
[1:57:54] grimzero617: You could do a shit in it?
[1:58:01] catherea: The heads of tics can still remain embedded in the skin even if you remove it
[1:58:02] ArkyteCurse: Azerite not looking arcane could support the theory that world souls aren't titans default and are corrupted by one of the forces. at the moment the titans have more magic invested into azeroth than other forces. azerite could be a mix of several forces but is arcane dominant
[1:58:11] alextheblight: dumping Kel'Thuzad's remains into it was enough to screw it up, so probably
[1:58:16] hyzenthlays: @catherea better than a poop analogy? xd
[1:58:22] DragnosiOfNede: Cheer100 Xal‚Äôitath‚Ä¶the reborn of a poo floater‚Ä¶.. winning
[1:58:41] Vandosz: Not anymore because now you see it coming
[1:59:03] Bobndude: big agree
[1:59:10] catherea: @hyzenthlays Depends on how you want to look at it
[1:59:12] Theorof: Hypothesis
[1:59:27] bottis96: So were all the old Gods connected/part submerged into Azeroth? Are there more too them below the surface?
[1:59:27] grimzero617: I legitimately love this theory
[1:59:29] Heranara: @alextheblight Right so we should not pour Gramps Remains into the Well of eternity either.
[1:59:41] showerbees: the story team is taking so many notes rn
[1:59:51] arthexwow: She's just a direct offspring of N'zoth for sure :D
[1:59:54] Connor_Quest: @ArkyteCurse It gives credence to why Sagaras destroyed worlds and not just take them over
[1:59:56] kanaab: Maybe not corrupted but "infused", like Trolls that turned into Night Elves, Eredar that turned into Man'ari
[2:01:08] brian_777777777: so she already used the timeways to absorb void energy from galakrond and you think she is doing something sussy in SOD
[2:01:12] times_old_roman: and SOD will be Cthun?
[2:01:14] Promilie: Slurp the Yoggy Power to regain her status as proper Old God
[2:01:37] Nulgar: oh and we know Blizz loves a good Thanatos Gambit
[2:01:42] Heranara: So She used Yogg-sarons üí© to make Galakron to use Galakrons üí© to get Yogg-sarons üí© ?
[2:01:48] alextheblight: that'd be insane
[2:01:59] alextheblight: (good type of insane)
[2:02:00] Quackster27: thunduz, thank you for the gift <3
[2:02:04] Bobndude: a new phase/boss in cthunn's room?!
[2:02:15] cyclopsnerd: I love this  build up they're doing with SoD, makes me so excited for the Saga
[2:02:34] Travnar: That seems like a first time for something like this in any media lol
[2:02:37] Travnar: Would be awesome
[2:02:40] Bobndude: would be wild
[2:02:41] grimzero617: Dude I cannot stand how much I love this idea
[2:02:53] str4ysheep: she is also harvesting old god blood in war within
[2:02:53] Nonyamuff: That would be cool
[2:02:58] Merex760: That would actually be incredible to use Classic WoW to tell new stories from that era that sets up retail
[2:03:11] alextheblight: so SoD would just be an elaborate ad for TWW? If so, I'm down
[2:03:25] bomayaa: I love the idea and if that isn't their plan, they need to rewrite it now
[2:03:32] the_howlermonkey: SOD is going to tell the story of Xalataths rise entirely  up to herr appearence in the next three xpacs??? Not just AQ
[2:03:41] Phenroi: LOL Slurpy slurp slurp
[2:03:46] morbid0ne: Slurry slurp? Goo
[2:03:49] bangoobangoo: That's the biggest support of this theory so far.
[2:03:54] Travnar: So are we expecting some sort of Lord Voldemort = Tom Riddle type of thing with Xal = Y'Sharj
[2:03:58] bangoobangoo: Just the name recognition
[2:04:09] kanaab: I like saying Y'shaarj as Why Charge Eh
[2:04:16] grimzero617: And the Yashaarj conflict takes place over the whole Wold Soul Saga?!
[2:04:24] Heranara: You say that but i already Temble when i hear the name Slurpy Slurp Slurp!
[2:04:31] Eregbueye: the most powerful one, and look what other 3 are capable of tho
[2:04:34] bomayaa: stupid dumb priest players
[2:05:04] Disjoint_Dwarf: I wish we could pick sides in this Cosmic Disco War
[2:05:06] ArkyteCurse: This theory also explains why Xal would partner with Galakrond. Who would have a bigger beef/vendetta with the Titans other than y'shaarj. Maybe Galakrond even knows that and that's how she convinced him to partner with her, by telling him the truth
[2:05:10] REAPER_Replicator: i always said Y'Shaarj was never fully killed just a part of him
[2:05:12] Aztecmike: So with Iridikron gathering the essence of Galakrond, does that potentially make him an ally or would he be working for Y'Shaarj
[2:05:30] alextheblight: we respect Y'Shaarj' new identity PrideTrans
[2:05:33] ArkyteCurse: Oh yep Iridikron
[2:05:45] bladestitch: Maybe she'll die then later reappear screaming "Fooled you!".
[2:05:57] Daffe3: maby she is a hidden daughter of a old god
[2:06:04] Disjoint_Dwarf: I, for one, would welcome our new Waifu overlord
[2:06:10] neverbornlucky: Taliesin do you think there ever was Teen Titans in wow see what I did there
[2:06:20] Disjoint_Dwarf: *Knifu
[2:06:22] seanstrachan: Hmmm I don't think it's pronounced like that though ;)
[2:06:23] showerbees: she may not care about the titans still though could just be using irridikron as a pawn to gain access to the timeways
[2:06:33] BreninUK: isnt it said Har-binge-er? =D
[2:06:34] applefactory: Harbin-jer
[2:06:41] apheelia96: I need to watch your last few cinematic analysis
[2:06:49] BreninUK: Lolz
[2:06:57] alextheblight: harbinger, or hardly bingin'
[2:07:01] MeggoArt: MeggoArt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! tneJellycat tneJellycat tneJellycat  xally chats hell yes
[2:07:03] Frazael: Do you think Azshara will ally with xal? The naga speak about the harbinger in a song of the depths
[2:07:22] MeggoArt: 56!
[2:07:56] neverbornlucky: Taliesin are you excited about all the future night elf hunter females that will be on your role play server soon with arcane bows thanks to hero talents ?
[2:08:02] Elrathir: 56 is nice, but not quite enough for your pretty teeth
[2:08:02] alextheblight: don't feel bad, Tali. I thought it was "harbringer" for an embarrassingly long time
[2:08:08] MeggoArt: you're too kind tneMovEviHeartEyes i actually had a different twitch name when i originally subbed
[2:08:18] applefactory: as a lore numpty, I'm confused. I thought the old gods were playthings of the void lot?
[2:08:29] Disjoint_Dwarf: Alternatively, Xal maybe is one of THE Void Lords?
[2:08:55] X_barley: Not like Azshara has anything to do with the well of eternity or anything
[2:09:09] Frazael: @X_barley exactly!
[2:09:15] applefactory: so wouldn't it be MORE SCARIERER to have her being a void entity, rather than old gods. We've battered them laods of times
[2:09:29] ArkyteCurse: What is the background behind Xal in TWW trailer? Is that like silvermoon with all the void portals, or is that some unknown place?
[2:09:33] Trebled_Mind: feels like the story of Diablo collecting the prime evils into one being. Like Xal is trying to become some what of a Tathemet. The original Evil dragon in Diablo.
[2:10:13] X_barley: Return to Forbidden Reach will go down as such an important patch for the lore
[2:10:21] alextheblight: low-key excited for Azshara becoming a god
[2:10:37] Spafuncio: Wonder if Azshara would be part of the League of Baddies with Xala'tath and Iridikron
[2:10:51] MeggoArt: azshara needs to come back so i can marry her
[2:11:07] MeggoArt: nyalotha
[2:11:07] X_barley: she got whisked away
[2:11:08] alextheblight: ny'alotha
[2:11:13] alextheblight: yes
[2:11:15] bladestitch: Fucking of from the raid.
[2:11:18] draeganfire: When she got yonked off by N'zoth
[2:11:26] alextheblight: she talked about taking a "new throne"
[2:11:33] X_barley: But it sounds like its going well for her to be fair
[2:11:38] Smeson: I genuinely get interested in this story you talk about with Y'shaarj, I hope you are correct
[2:11:39] grimzero617: She had enough of that boss room just like the rest of us
[2:11:43] Henshini: First sh gave us the knife, then she ran away
[2:11:48] X_barley: Also that's nearly 10 years ago in Canon
[2:11:48] MeggoArt: important that she gave wrathion the empty blade of the black empire before she fucked off
[2:11:56] alextheblight: hmm
[2:12:13] alextheblight: too fabulous to be stopped, that's how
[2:12:16] draeganfire: She is certainly arrogant enough to do it
[2:12:23] ArkyteCurse: She could have done it with Xal! Obvi Xal is how she opened that void portal when she escaped
[2:12:24] applefactory: the void stuff is much more interesting - the primalists give off serious 'crap transformer' vibes imo. Like that one that turned into a dinosaur. It was rubbish.
[2:12:30] Elrathir: @MeggoArt oh holy sh-
[2:12:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin can we make the Naga into a third faction already plz
[2:12:56] applefactory: Hope so. I feel like they're in the way of the good stuff
[2:13:05] morbid0ne: Crap transformer, lol. I like Iridikron, so far.
[2:13:15] TyndiVelspaz: Bet last titan is Sargeras because the Void kills the other titans
[2:13:16] Kuppjark: cant wait to kill gods again :)
[2:13:29] rushof90: a
[2:13:35] Metket: please let us lose once
[2:13:37] applefactory: titans vs Void Lords is the cage match we all want to see.
[2:13:37] Thoreya: :O
[2:13:40] rushof90: so the end of wow
[2:13:49] Thoreya: he‚Äôs that strong to do that?
[2:13:50] DashzTV: Where do we go after the Last Titan is the real question
[2:13:52] nadiaaa: f u amanthul
[2:13:54] ArkyteCurse: What if the void/void gods as we know it is gone and is now under the control of Azshara, kinda like how we left bolvar with the lich. Azshara gets to be queen and stay out of our way
[2:14:07] shabobado: metzen said midnight would include the unification of of the elf tribes. wouldn‚Äôt azshara have a part to play in that?
[2:14:14] bomayaa: you think void and titans wiped in one expansion?
[2:14:15] yelreah: man i really do hope we see more of sargergas
[2:14:18] draeganfire: I think that Azeroth, when she is born, is going to be a culmination of all the "cosmic forces" and will prove to be too much for any of the other powers to handle
[2:14:20] madmerco: Midnight ends with us killing the Shadow Jailer robot in Xereth umbra.
[2:14:29] Disjoint_Dwarf: So is she a First One?
[2:14:34] ArkyteCurse: Because a whole Force can't collapse otherwise the entire cosmos would spin out of balance (unless that's the plan post Last Titan)
[2:14:45] rushof90: the end of the trilogy will be the final space is what I meant if cut part of my message
[2:14:46] applefactory: please...let us never mention the first ones again
[2:14:48] yelreah: i think azeroth is just corrupted to hell and back at this point. like she whispers to magni (?) last i remember and guess who else whispers to people
[2:14:55] alextheblight: "first ones"? Never heard of it. Nope.
[2:15:01] Disjoint_Dwarf: So "stem cells"-ish
[2:15:12] vlaovich88: They are stem cells
[2:15:18] sScottyKarate: Marvels Celestials
[2:15:19] rushof90: xpac **
[2:15:20] Bobndude: its an egg
[2:15:21] Kuppjark: D:
[2:15:25] Trebled_Mind: it‚Äôs the way Celestials are born in Marvel
[2:15:26] X_barley: First ones are (ironically) like Titans in Greek mythology and the worldsouls are Gods, lying in slumber, just waiting to be born.
[2:15:31] neverbornlucky: Taliesin repoducing with rocks
[2:15:34] bucephalos: How could her power destroy the work of the first ones?
[2:15:35] Kuppjark: interesting and disgusting
[2:15:36] vlaovich88: @disjoint_dwarf opp you beat me to it. Slow fingers haha
[2:15:43] applefactory: the word 'essence' is doing some seriously heavy lifting here
[2:16:00] Frazael: Ordering
[2:16:01] aeson_of_raid_sock: how are you‚Ä¶. infusing your ‚Äúessence‚Äù?
[2:16:02] applefactory: I just keep thinking bear spooge
[2:16:06] X_barley: HUH
[2:16:09] Theorof: Essence is poo water if we are following the narrative today
[2:16:09] catherea: Memories of Antorus
[2:16:10] alextheblight: lewd
[2:16:11] MeggoArt: what i'm gathering from this is that the titans don't bang and we have the curse of flesh to thank for that LUL
[2:16:17] funviking99: LUL
[2:16:38] Ueberschande: what will the earth soul become then in the end?
[2:16:40] madmerco: Azeroth is essentially Captain Planet she's been infused with so many types of magic. a Bukakke in the context of the rock jiz analogy.
[2:16:48] neverbornlucky: Taliesin you should watch the anime named Cherry Magic! Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?!
[2:16:53] grimzero617: grimzero617 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! This is the best lore theory you've ever had. Completely makes up for "the Maldraxxus"
[2:17:26] yelreah: i think maybe it‚Äôll be something like what happened to argus‚Äô worldsoul. hence maybe more involvement of sargeras in last titan
[2:17:31] mxfelwinter: what if the curse of flesh is just reverse titan's "orderization" of an already existing beings that the titans basically transformed into basically stone and metal machines
[2:17:37] applefactory: the big bads right now don't seem big or bad enough - at this point I'm not sure another old god would do the job. We need someething more bigger and more badder.
[2:18:08] a_cyrus_: how could she be?
[2:18:28] jmalmin: That is a good comment from H√•p.
[2:18:31] X_barley: Holly didn't respond to this one as not to spoil us
[2:18:44] Bobndude: you can glyph your mindbender to be a sha-ling no?
[2:19:09] a_cyrus_: no way
[2:19:09] grimblymcgoo: @applefactory  Comments like that got us the Jailer. Calm down
[2:19:18] Disjoint_Dwarf: personal Headcanon, Pandaren SPriests serve the Sha/Y'Shaarj
[2:19:46] a_cyrus_: no way she is Y'Shaarj
[2:19:48] Nulgar: @applefactory we got someone that could destroy and re-create the entire universe last expansion tneEvi how much bigger do you wanna go?
[2:20:18] jhopps12: its gonna be titled: "Poop in the Water"
[2:20:41] a_cyrus_: i saw but i don't agree, besides that it's a cool theory
[2:20:44] alextheblight: 'tis a real possibility
[2:20:52] Nulgar: Corgo100 say "Y'Shaarj is a surely Susan" 10 times frogmu1Hehe
[2:20:52] bucephalos: he ate the heart of the thunder king
[2:21:20] mxfelwinter: Xalathat personality is way too diferent to how old gods related beings behave
[2:21:41] a_cyrus_: @mxfelwinter agree
[2:21:48] neverbornlucky: Taliesin are you for Sure it isn't Secretly Donald Trump ?
[2:22:13] jmalmin: I do not really think she is a old god. Mostly because she collect void energy. I think she is something else. Because the old gods trapped her in that blade to keep her away from them.
[2:22:16] grimzero617: Don't all the old gods speak differently?
[2:22:21] yelreah: she‚Äôs been the only successful one thus far compared to other older gods LOL
[2:22:33] applefactory: Or that's just a void thing
[2:22:43] MeggoArt: my take is that the lovecraft references don't match up. xalatath is much closer to a Nyarlathotep type being
[2:22:51] vlaovich88: She is good at making us think she is cool, that is for sure!
[2:22:57] onlyfayz: The only reason why I don't think Xal'atath is an old god, is because she has a "visage" form as the only Old God and/or Void Lord right? From what we know?
[2:23:11] grimzero617: Nzoth having a crazy loud booming voice was jarring
[2:23:21] alextheblight: should have stuck with the fishsona, yeah
[2:23:24] NiteOwl11617: could you imagine fighting a tiny fish model for a final raid boss?
[2:23:30] a_cyrus_: wasnt xalatah imprisoned by the other old gods?
[2:23:46] applefactory: my money's on some kind of void herald. Another old god would be pretty disappointing at this stage. She's too interesting a character.
[2:24:09] Disjoint_Dwarf: @grimzero617 right? would have been scarier if Nzoth whispered all the time
[2:24:28] iamdrewonline: its dinner time
[2:24:39] ka_gu_ra: Hi @TaliesinAndEvitel ! Just finished Shadowbringers 5.3. Why does a 35 year old man have to cry multiple times through one expansion of a video game?
[2:24:45] onlyfayz: Would it not make more sense that xal'atath is the herald of y'shaarj ?
[2:24:58] rushof90: not that I want It to end but how long do you really think this game can go on the trilogy build up really feels like an ending to me
[2:25:28] alextheblight: byeee, have a nice dinner
[2:25:30] MeggoArt: tneEviHeart tneEviHeart tneEviHeart tneEviHeart tneEviHeart tneNzothEye tneNzothEye <3 <3 <3
[2:25:32] MrScotticus: Have a great evening!
[2:25:34] mxfelwinter: both old gods gaslight and trick, but Xalathat doesnt exactly usually seem to corrupt or drive people insane (or asimilate), she just use their own personalities and flaws for her own goals and just discard people once she got what she want
[2:25:35] Frazael: Thank you Tali! Byeeeeee
[2:25:38] siegeorc: always lovely Tali!
[2:25:42] kittiezZ_: enjoy dinner :D
[2:25:45] riffraff005: thanks for the stream!
[2:26:10] NiteOwl11617: good night
[2:26:20] Vandosz: extended stream!
[2:26:30] MeggoArt: love this energy
[2:26:50] morbid0ne: Lol, Taliesin baited for an encode xD
[2:26:58] MeggoArt: consider: how much of this is her and how much is the blade?
[2:27:07] mxfelwinter: i mean corrupt like mind control
[2:27:09] vlaovich88: Encore encore encore!!!!
[2:27:17] catherea: GivePLZ cather29Soon TakeNRG
[2:27:40] morbid0ne: Lol, night!
[2:27:42] MeggoArt: <333
[2:27:46] Brogzor: great content thanks!
[2:27:47] siegeorc: lol
[2:27:52] siegeorc: tneNzothEye tneNzothEye tneNzothEye
[2:28:04] mxfelwinter: she doesnt do the traditional fel corruption, necromantic corruption, old god corruption, she just use your normal real world c orruption
