[1:23:26] Hidden_Citizen: what are splits?

[1:23:28] Kromede: undead caster hunter itscityboy Kappa

[1:23:40] I_DoctorSatan_I: I'm going to save my Soul Ash for ilvl 210 Legendary, that 190 is "meh" tbh..210 to 225 Soul Ash mats its pretty significant than 1250 to 2000 soul ash.
[1:23:41] sevens777s: whats the point of waiting @Towelliee
[1:23:43] Staksor: can we get rank 4 in season 1? danHmm
[1:23:46] AureliusXV: same amount
[1:23:47] Soulshoxs: you need ash to level up to making rank 4 though
[1:23:51] br0fest0r: that just costs gold though
[1:23:56] itscityboy: @sharie Yeah I'm trying to figure that one out. I've played 5 classes so far this pre patch trying to figure it out PepoDance
[1:23:57] JediNeo99999: The cost is the same regardless
[1:23:57] Madnezz123: its so hard for me to delete my gear that I wont be using for leveling lol
[1:23:59] mainetrev: dont you need just enough ash to make up the difference to upgrade
[1:24:00] Soulshoxs: gonna take time with the limit of it
[1:24:00] N3llee: so you are saying its better to hold on to the stiga
[1:24:01] Vosy1984: isn't there a list on what you can get per week? @Towelliee
[1:24:02] zulter2: It's the same amount of soul ash to upgrade or to craft. So it doesn't amtter
[1:24:09] torvoltas: hm dosnt this all add up to smae number upgrading or waiting?
[1:24:11] mainetrev: so from one to 2 750? + the item?
[1:24:11] SgtFinesse: Towelliee where can i get the Shadowlands Countdown Add on?

[1:26:48] Zomgboy: especially since you cant switch that easily
[1:26:49] rhk_: If thy stopped doing big changes we wouldnt be

[1:26:54] aikopooh: my first choice is Kyrian second is Necrolords
[1:26:54] Sollice: Morning everyone, Morning @Towelliee
[1:26:55] Domi98_: mages were settled on nightfae and blizz just fked us yesterday with the hotfix now we need to resim
[1:26:55] Staksor: feels good to choose a covenant only by visuals LUL Venthyr all the way
[1:26:56] Opti87: Either way, im going necrolord. Even if it isnt the best.
[1:26:56] yng_tc: @Towelliee What cov do I want for shadow priest?
[1:26:56] AdoraVal: I am also confused which one to pick
[1:26:57] Kin_: im not panicking, im panicking that my rogue isnt levelled yet xD
[1:26:58] MysticRaven_: when the meaningful choice is too meaningful
[1:27:02] oopat11: flip a coin
[1:27:04] Hidden_Citizen: I just pick whichever covenant looks the coolest
[1:27:06] Ezekyler: i go Night Fae, i don't care about what's more op, i choose what i most like and care
[1:27:10] Genni_boi: im going Venthyr for arms warrior
[1:27:10] oopat11: choose
[1:27:19] br0fest0r: Its gonna be alright, everybody panic!
[1:27:22] sipilde: going for the look too lol
[1:27:22] I_DoctorSatan_I: pfftt...Venthyr 100% Can nobody change my mind and going in SL with 2.8M gold...pshh, im good.
[1:27:23] callum_bm: Ez pick for a hunter
[1:27:24] Madnezz123: @Towelliee covenants for dk are almost perfectly balanced. The difference from each other is 1%
[1:27:27] Kromede: i like the new blue emotes towRee towPog towHype towCringe
[1:27:28] ulamog7: !mounts
[1:27:28] DeanoTV: revendreth Kreygasm
[1:27:32] ScratchStar: yeah team Venthyr!

[1:27:35] TMMOOF: Loving this chill as music @towelliee
[1:27:36] nocte1: my DK will be going Venthyr i think
[1:27:36] Brianp_123: @Towelliee do i go scryor or aldor?
[1:27:42] andurian01: Imagine picking wrong and getting benched? Or having 4 toons of the same class to have one of each
[1:27:42] Wreckyuk: for m+ or raiding?
[1:27:45] N3llee: same with my dk
[1:27:47] MarquisLek: they just buffed convoke the spirits so night fae numba 1
[1:27:49] Lupusdeus: No
[1:27:49] TimeLordReaper: please tell me unholy dk is not nightfae anymore
[1:27:50] MysticRaven_: Since i dont have a guild to raid im glad shadow priest mythic covenant is necrolord i really wanted to go necro
[1:27:53] NILLme: im glad that blizz quietly made necrolords bis covenant
[1:27:54] sharie: i want Kyrian, but venthyr have a slight edge for raiding. Probably still go for kyrian for the looks
[1:27:57] aikopooh: kyrian still top pick as for destro if u ask me
[1:27:58] Sollice: Going MM Hunter was thinking Kyrian but would love to be Venthyr
[1:27:58] Kromede: towOof
[1:28:02] NILLme: for dks
[1:28:03] ZyntosAran: @Val_Kyrie_Pixie all of them? You can only do one per char
[1:28:04] Soulshoxs: you won't be able to get up to rank 4 for legendaries in mythic at all. For a tailor to make a rank 4 base item it takes 31k shrouded cloth, 36k lightless silk and 18030 and 6975 orbioreal shards to even make the 1st rank 4 base
[1:28:07] darkrowse21: is kyrian still best for hunters
[1:28:17] yunitoYuniro: Not sure what class to main lol let alone pick a convenant
[1:28:17] warrenny: Saw afterlives maldraxxus and played it on beta now want them as ret
[1:28:19] railroad10989: what is the good covenant for moonkin??
[1:28:20] Madnezz123: @TimeLordReaper all covenants are balanced for dk. Arguably necrolord is the best
[1:28:22] ShowDUH: @twillightopal no it's Night Fae
[1:28:24] AdoraVal: @ZyntosAran Yeah I know, but after you cap at 40 you can switch right?
[1:28:27] UberManDude: @Towelliee Question, were the release times in the previous expansion earlier than the current one that is coming out on Monday?
[1:28:27] Grantmc88: @twillightopal NF and Kyrian are really close now
[1:28:29] Eshel: I’m just tickled shitless that people aren’t talking about the “ripcord” anymore lmao
[1:28:38] Sollice: I refuse to go night fae the armor for mail looks like shit on a stick
[1:28:38] ZyntosAran: @Val_Kyrie_Pixie no, you will loose everything yo ugo
[1:28:39] darkrowse21: wowhead said kyrian
[1:28:41] warrenny: @yunitoyuniro What classes you considering
[1:28:41] Lincoln_WoW: and the venthyr soulbinds aren't fully implemented in simc
[1:28:43] TacticalKabuki: Chat, does anyone know where his leveling bar comes from?
[1:28:45] ZyntosAran: @Val_Kyrie_Pixie *got
[1:28:49] PotbellyGoat: how long is the current 30% going for on GFuel?
[1:28:52] 1boomajin1: kyrian still best for M+ though?
[1:28:57] ShowDUH: @twillightopal follow Icy-Veins for hunters not Wowhead ;)
[1:28:57] Kemsari: for every casual player it should be a style desicion, not what ypou HAVE to take because mythic raiders or top m+ players choose that

[1:29:05] AdoraVal: @ZyntosAran Ah so then I want four mains then if I want everything huh? x.x
[1:29:06] PotbellyGoat: thanks man!
[1:29:07] ghxstyard: Blizzard: "WRITE THAT DOWN"
[1:29:08] ShowDUH: @twillightopal they aren't updating day to day
[1:29:08] Kraandrijver: How come your shield of the righteous duration is 3 times as long as mine?
[1:29:10] sevens777s: @Towelliee is the 10% enough for pugs to meta game ?

[1:29:16] Shrenko: damn it I ordered before 30% LUL
[1:29:16] BuzzCutBronson: lifes great
[1:29:22] Soulshoxs: so essentially it takes 18k ash to even get to rank 4 base item
[1:29:23] Sollice: Has anyone had the Moon Pie GFUEL?
[1:29:23] warrenny: Kyrian boring tho plus identity thing is dumb

[2:23:42] Crysis_live: @dawnovun there is not a large difference, I believe it's only Ray Traced shadows. Other games have reflections, lights, etc. Ray Tracing is not fully implemented in every game

[4:06:39] flanders61: can you change which one you use when or are you locked to one type?
[4:06:42] Bayne77: Light it on!
[4:06:44] Pathoren: According ti bicepspump on Wowhead Venthyr still best for Unholy DK. Going Venthyr unless that changes before I hit 60
[4:06:46] Creesy69: at this rate hpal is just gonna be holy light spam
[4:06:53] Lincoln_WoW: yes
[4:06:57] Craetos_: ye

[4:07:12] ApexBullets: definitely
[4:07:13] CrowCommando: I have Bliz's "Just nerf it" mentality. I wish they would buff the weak things in order to balance sometimes instead of just nerfing everything - Fun Detected
[4:07:15] MechNL: shaman druid disc

[4:08:02] alex12645: to make you have to bring them to raids
[4:08:04] Creesy69: our MT has gone vengeance just for the debuff, because no one wants to play havoc
[4:08:06] MechNL: we dont have a dh in our raid because havoc sucks massive penis and our tanks are brew and a guy that refuses to play anything other than prot pal
[4:08:23] thebakeriscomingforu: The debuffs are lame because Blizz made a huge deal about removing them from the game. Then when monks and DH were added, they gave the debuffs.... which makes them mandatory
[4:08:28] MOLAR305: Ñ its got the tilde on the N

[4:09:06] im__carrot: torghast seems fun
[4:09:15] mackanj91: if they dont wanna remove those buffs DH and monk bring, they should let more classes/specc bring em, survival for exempel that doesnt bring anything
[4:09:18] Craetos_: well...you want 1x DH just because of debuff tho
[4:09:19] KingGoris: do you have one for the jailer too? im team jailer all the way LUL

[4:10:46] Creesy69: warrior feelsbadman
[4:10:49] Cosmolus: Warriors are dogshit xD
[4:10:58] A_P_P_L_E_S: warriors LUL
[4:11:02] Craetos_: arms warrior looking to be decent + shouts
[4:11:07] YellowFlag: VDH are not good in Myth ? They slap so hard in M+
[4:11:10] dalaraz: i mean you dont need to brink a monk for 3 physical dps,and it will be hard to have more than 3
[4:11:13] YouMadAtMeBro: since u been playing the beta alot can u switch ur covenant after u choose one
[4:11:19] cosmothug: prot pala gonna get nerfed
[4:11:22] KingSpud91: vdh is higher than prot palas
[4:11:23] SaiyanKent: Did they nerf kyrian pally?
[4:11:24] MechNL: yes but it resets ur renown @2L2G
[4:11:26] Craetos_: execute phase with Venthyr and talents will be strong
[4:11:28] Creesy69: i'm maining warrior for utility KEKW
[4:11:32] Cosmolus: KEKW
[4:11:33] thebakeriscomingforu: I think tanks are decently close, except for prot warriors
[4:11:35] turbofreee: @Towelliee Could you share the vendor macro you used earlier please?
[4:11:40] Treason824: lol just say it
[4:11:47] Affiiance: Warriors kekw
[4:11:53] Creesy69: we dont know yet really
[4:11:54] MechNL: arms will scale into the tier with more haste as they always do
[4:11:58] MechNL: you wont take htem on prog
[4:12:05] YouMadAtMeBro: did i make it to the video that tauren priest with a mace hammer?
[4:12:05] MOLAR305: AOE pally is higher, single target i feel VDH as venthyr its higher bc of sinful brand leggo
[4:12:15] Cosmolus: Plain bad that's what u mean KEKW
[4:12:16] Ezekyler: Warriors FeelsBadMan
[4:12:17] TheRealAxiom: they bring the %5 attack buff tho lol
[4:12:20] thebakeriscomingforu: They are last currently but warriors tend to scale as expac goes on
[4:12:25] Bapcha: waerriors are fine. half the people wont do keys higher than 15
[4:12:42] Ponnjie: @Towelliee What covenant would you suggest for a ret paladin?
[4:12:53] Craetos_: prot warrior is currently unusable for raiding, but as dps, you want arms warrior because execute phase with Venthyr and talents is really strong now + 2 shouts as utility
[4:12:57] denith969: im still trying to decide what to main between WW, Havoc, Prot Pally. i just do AOTC and M+ tho
[4:13:03] Aro725: 70 cold LMAO
[4:13:08] alertbagel: i need to get back into WoW
[4:13:12] YouMadAtMeBro: truth beer is so good its from cincy ohio its 7.3% ipa taste good too
[4:13:14] Ex_Zero_: as of right now, Ret is probably going Venthyr
[4:13:19] imperfectlie: bear best tank Kappa
[4:13:24] Kisswani: more than half the people wont do 15s
[4:13:24] thebakeriscomingforu: if you are doing progression meta matters. If you are not doing progression then it doesn't matter and play what you want.
[4:13:25] Nolmac: 70 cold???
[4:13:31] Ex_Zero_: altho, we get a new change everyday... so
[4:13:33] fishdix7: is brewmaster good?
[4:13:34] MOLAR305: the leggo cdr helps spam sinful brand more often
[4:13:35] Ex_Zero_: who knows
[4:13:35] irishwhiskey__: turbofreee, do you mean that macro that lets you quickly upgrade gear on beta?
[4:13:40] LuffyLechuga: how are dk frost going? Bad I suppose

[4:17:07] Arhaar: do we level as prot to 60 ? or retri
[4:17:12] Hazno: @MexicanMisker very realistic
[4:17:12] ya7y007: @Towelliee how many hours stream on launch marathon, and whats ur expectation for tech issues , how bd from 1 to 10
[4:17:15] Murry07: And now even Flight master's Whistle will not work :(
[4:17:17] fishdix7: i heard u need like 8 hours from 50 to 60
[4:17:19] fishdix7: maybe less
[4:17:43] YouMadAtMeBro: it ticks me off i played wow more than 2 months for BFA and i only pvp and i dont hear anything for pvp about shadowlands
[4:17:46] ya7y007: how bad
[4:17:47] subluxt7: i appreciate the grind cap tbh
[4:17:50] Hazno: there's not a lot of "required" shit to do in Shadowlands to stay up to date on your characters
[4:17:51] MechNL: only daily thing is maw stygia iirc
[4:17:53] GFiTV: @Towelliee There is no rush to grind day one right? just level and get capped in week 1? (eu has an extra day to get capped, so even more lazy?)
[4:17:55] Zivs: people gonna complain that there's no content KEKW
[4:17:56] Eraste: i level pretty slow and im expecting ~15 hours or so

[4:18:40] Hazno: @Towelliee haha no, what you "need" to do during week 1 :D
[4:18:41] subluxt7: the bigger question is will Stormrage actually be up for expansion? If i recall it was down for quite awhile when BFA launched LUL
[4:18:42] Empyrialist: "I do not concede" too topical blizz...
[4:18:45] assman_ny: Im there lol
[4:18:49] GFiTV: @Towelliee Which covenant are you picking? i myself am going kyrian :)
[4:18:59] Drakenking: @2L2G theres a few articles on wowhead but your pvp wins go towards items in the great vault, honor is back as a currency you can buy and upgrade gear with based on your rating, your gear is bought from a vendor so you choose your progression, pvp scaling was removed in prepatch, etc
[4:19:12] LeonardLongNips: guys -- pve only do I go fury or outlaw? I cant decide at all.
[4:19:13] Seerated: Says the guy instantly zoning in to a low pop server :D

[4:19:38] smiteyzzz: Ugh torghast

[4:48:58] Zevtherev: @towelliee I don’t think I’ll be on til later launch time. Is it even worth it?
[4:49:02] Drakenking: its 100% true
[4:49:06] Drakenking: database merges are fucking scary
[4:49:08] taolos: there's only so much you can do for massive population increase

[4:56:21] kaizer4400: I can't fucking wait either
[4:56:24] MexicanMisker: do u think they will add more dungeons? 8 dungeons seems kinda low...
[4:56:27] KingSpud91: it definitely has potential but we just have to wait and see what blizz do with it.
[4:56:30] Ziephier: I thought Burning Crusade and Lich King were good expansions
[4:56:32] ericscicluna: fuck corruption and bonus rolls

[4:57:03] philxi: How much linear single player content do i need to do for renowned?
[4:57:04] TweakT: I just ran through Ghostlands & Sunstrider isle... no expansion is gonna beat my BC vibe
[4:57:05] zenmastafunk: funny thing is it will literally have to compete with BC
[4:57:07] Aeylid: i dont think the gearing will be an issue i just think its gonna be a big culture shock to a lot of peeps and perhaps they should have eased them into it a bit more
[4:57:09] Aeylid: but overall
[4:57:10] Aro725: i feel like the bonus rolls will be hard to get used to at first. But once you get loot youll appreciate it alot more
[4:57:10] TweakT: but Vanilla was the best over WoW experience
[4:57:10] Aeylid: DO IT!
[4:57:17] ram95r: What covenant do you recommend for a paladin tank @towelliee
[4:57:18] philxi: I just wanna log in and farm some gear with my friends.

[4:57:32] dowden: MemoAcebo the servers are already live? You can be online and you will get the quest as soon as Blizzard flips the switch, no need to logout and back in
[4:57:38] MetallicusGaming: Work hard and play hard
[4:57:44] mojusk: quality over quantity loot
[4:57:48] Choowey: Great vault
[4:57:48] MercUnow: They pushed out Bonus Rolls but they did increase the amount of Loot you receive from your weekly chest
[4:58:07] highlydegen: did you prefer m+ in legion or bfa @Towelliee
[4:58:11] LeonnSol: Could you explain it please? the weekly vault @Towelliee
[4:58:16] Choowey: Is BfA the worst xpac in your opinion?
[4:58:31] Spykex02: i really enjoy prot paladin but tanking intimidates the hell out of me
[4:58:31] sunprotofactor: what made BFA so bad?

[4:59:38] highlydegen: what about mayo mechanics with the ketchup
[4:59:41] Craetos_: if there is a ketchup, I am all in :D

[5:06:02] sstriife: at 120ilvl when will you start to replace gear ?
[5:06:04] Syllvn: Beta streaming is not reflective of launch though dude.
[5:06:09] Saranade: I'm just not too excited about having SO many systems to consider
[5:06:15] sinlesssinner: yea for mythic geared pppl i understand it, but even for alts...tahts a new one for SL
[5:06:18] mojusk: mythic w socket last all of leveling
[5:06:18] Farfic: don't normal dungeons drop 158 ilvl stuff??

[5:06:45] zenmastafunk: @Towelliee should i level in a group or solo?
[5:06:49] TheNautican: should save your rare kills for when you're 60 tho
[5:06:50] sinlesssinner: i have like 5 alts i leveled in prepatch, but it seems the gear i got from the rares, is enough for like 2 zones, which is kinda meh to me
[5:06:51] Saranade: I believe the azerite shit doesn't work at level 51
[5:06:51] squigglytv: @4caps no
[5:06:53] MetallicusGaming: 4caps essences and azerite traits are disabled in SL zones

[5:12:18] dirtyoldgrandpa024: like the one ethereal dude when you come back to maw for first time , you have to keep reloading screen or leave area and come back to see him
[5:12:29] Farfic: it's prob under or up top
[5:12:32] Butawhydood20: @defender95 I you're seeing the weakaura he's using, all of the skills under the weakaura does list the bindings
[5:12:32] Syllvn: Wouldn't the WQ be disabled at launch as nobody would have them unlocked yet? Not that it doesn't need to be fixed for alts
[5:12:35] Zooka03: @MetallicusGaming i havent watched him in a while so. i had no clue
[5:12:35] RAF_Sean: Do you not get the gem that tells you where she is when you select the quest on the right?
[5:12:42] xluckydawgx: Its south im pretty sure
[5:12:56] xluckydawgx: Look at comments
[5:12:58] MetallicusGaming: Zooka03 how dare you Kappa

[5:13:19] defender95: yep
[5:13:20] MILESkg21: yeah
[5:13:21] RAF_Sean: Click the quest and the icon will point up

[5:13:25] Ausden: report it as bug
[5:13:30] Zooka03: @MetallicusGaming but it isnt like naxx is goin to take a while, i guess he doesnt want to divert retail players with classic wow
[5:13:31] Mogwaimonk: submit
[5:13:33] squigglytv: yer, also click the ? and it should have a little yellow icon
[5:13:36] RAF_Sean: It’s not a bug
[5:13:38] JubJubWantRubRubs: @Towelliee next comment said something about it couldnt be completed, but maybe its a old comment
