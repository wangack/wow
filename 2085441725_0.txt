[2:51:24] Vigi9413: do we hate shuffle?
[2:51:29] Vigi9413: i don't think it's terrible
[2:51:29] avenueone: just make all classes but deathknights v deathknights
[2:51:57] Drathimos: @sunileif i do think we will be choosing our cosmic team for the upcoming cosmic war
[2:52:08] sunileif: omg thats what the pirate flag is
[2:52:16] sunileif: many leaders gonna die!
[2:52:34] Vigi9413: so when the introduce solo rbgs we run for the hills
[2:52:37] sunileif: please not my calia!!!
[2:52:52] eMBeaR64oz: wonder if they could do something where like you solo q into 3s bracket, it pairs you up under 2400 and then after the game it could be a thing of like "check box to stay as group?" or something
[2:53:04] eMBeaR64oz: so you could inject some randoms into 3v3 at ratings up to a certain point
[2:53:16] bolddywow: solo rbgs will be so fun
[2:53:32] sunileif: ey have solo rbgsth
[2:53:36] sunileif: they'
[2:53:37] Vigi9413: so how do you think they revamp solo shuffle as to make it more rewarding to not stop queing 3's
[2:53:51] sunileif: thats what blitz is, it has a mmr attached to it
[2:54:21] eMBeaR64oz: @krome2dadome @notmes my sister is visiting this weekend for an oscar party but im down to log in after this weekend sometime
[2:54:58] sunileif: inflation based on player pool size?
[2:55:09] bolddywow: @sunileif  u neet to have attached mmr with displayed numbers otherwise players will not play it
[2:55:14] bolddywow: need*
[2:55:15] Vigi9413: i think solo has  introduced more people to pvp but it's definitely flawed like the trolls who just choose not to heal and lose every round
[2:55:33] sunileif: @bolddywow its displayed when you pull up the /who of the bg
[2:55:41] Drathimos: ive been able to do more arena with shuffle than i have been able to for the past 10 years
[2:55:46] Drathimos: in just one expac
[2:55:50] Vigi9413: so like... a different glad for every bracket?
[2:55:58] sunileif: my mm has 2k blitz rating
[2:56:17] Vigi9413: 3 different mounts n stuff
[2:56:18] crusadein: you think the upcoming Solo RBGs will give the high warlord/grand marshal title like solo gives elite

[2:56:50] Vigi9413: 3 different gear sets would be cool but would one set be ass in a different bracket?
[2:57:05] sunileif: give a seperate mount color per  2s 3s and rbg
[2:57:38] Vigi9413: i loved our shadowlands rbgs
[2:57:48] Vigi9413: but i hate most rbg'ers they're toxic as hell
[2:58:06] sunileif: @Vigi9413 thats all pvp
[2:58:49] theodeth: hey Mes, guessing you already covered the patch notes?
[2:58:51] Vigi9413: i feel like they should've had an mmr reset somewhere
[2:59:01] dawsonator171: @Vigi9413 MES is also toxic
[2:59:16] sunileif: theres gonna be more?
[2:59:17] Vigi9413: green players shouldn't be stuck at 2k mmr because of 2 seasons ago
[2:59:20] theodeth: i haven't looked at them in depth yet
[2:59:26] sunileif: @dawsonator171 NODDERS
[2:59:34] petkicklol: feeling like unholy is even more doomed with no fw nerfs

[2:59:57] Drathimos: so season 4 ptr should come out next week or the week after?
[3:00:00] sunileif: like the other day when mes was so angry despite 900 subs
[3:00:23] dawsonator171: mes is angry alot lately.
[3:00:27] eMBeaR64oz: o wow i didnt see those outlaw parts
[3:00:36] Vigi9413: like seriously though how do you not even put them on the blue post.. they can't be that in denial

[3:04:33] sunileif: just make dk do 15% more dam to leather
[3:04:39] sunileif: fixed
[3:04:59] Vigi9413: looks like dh's will just have to always make sure throw glaive is on cd before blade dance?
[3:05:06] Vigi9413: to maintain 4 set
[3:05:10] crusadein: @Vigi9413 i really wish diseases got buffed man, doing 9k dmg into 1m health pools agony
[3:05:57] Drathimos: dk being a low mobility but unstoppable is good class fantasy but deaths advance uptime is too low to make an impact. i think it should be a permanent passive
[3:06:00] Vigi9413: i tried playing my ret and it just feels bad to me but i know the spec isn't terrible
[3:06:40] Vigi9413: i see no problem with glimpse
[3:06:41] Vigi9413: Kappa
[3:06:43] Old_Tomatoes: What do they want DK to be?
[3:07:11] Vigi9413: i think frost needs just a total rework it's so weird
[3:07:22] Drathimos: if we were to get a new class in world soul saga what do you think it would be? something from warcraft 3?
[3:07:34] Vigi9413: imagine they give frost dk the survival hunter treatment and just completely rework that spec into something different
[3:07:53] Drathimos: i am guessing tinker or warden
[3:08:00] Vigi9413: @Drathimos we're getting a race in war within not sure if they'll drop a class
[3:08:15] Old_Tomatoes: Wouldnt they have announced it at the reveal?
[3:08:17] Drathimos: @Vigi9413 ya, it would come in midnight or tlt
[3:08:18] Old_Tomatoes: if it was a class
[3:08:42] Old_Tomatoes: Agility Pog
[3:09:10] Old_Tomatoes: They used abilities like blink and fok tho
[3:09:57] Drathimos: i feel like warden could be dhs third spec. their gameplay is very similar but different theme. i can imagine illidan and maeiv becoming a pair and they'll mentor others
[3:10:14] Drathimos: felrush/blink, night warrior/demon form
[3:10:31] Old_Tomatoes: I swear people just want goblin techies analogues in pvp
[3:10:39] Drathimos: illidan became the warden of saregras at the end
[3:10:50] Vigi9413: should turn frost dk into like a frost incarnate like a ranged hybrid thing idk it'd be neat
[3:10:59] Old_Tomatoes: A medic sounds cool and thats pretty much it to me

[3:11:57] XDCodeman: it would end up being a melee dps tank and support class probably
[3:12:48] XDCodeman: how many axes you making mes?
[3:12:53] Drathimos: i cant imagine they'll leave dh as the only class with 2 specs forever
[3:13:39] Old_Tomatoes: I dont think it will ever happen because they wont ever make a techy kind of expansion
[3:13:43] XDCodeman: i want 4th shaman spec to happen earth tank spec would be so sick then all 4 elements have a spec
[3:14:07] Drathimos: well theres a world revamp coming so we're gona need a lot of engineers. that could be the theme that introduces them
[3:15:06] XDCodeman: to be fair also who knows what we are gonna find underground could be evoker 2.0
[3:15:28] Drathimos: yeah they said the blood elf zone will be the main hub for midnight expac and it will be greatly expanded/revamped
[3:15:44] Drathimos: probably same for northrend/ulduar
[3:16:18] Drathimos: taliesin also made a video hinting about a possible upcoming "player housing" feature
[3:16:26] Drathimos: he got the inside scoop
[3:16:36] Drathimos: revamp the world to allow housing
[3:17:00] avenueone: housing in ultima online was the best
[3:17:03] Drathimos: it wont be like garrison, that was a flop
[3:17:11] avenueone: ud stealth in and kill them and take all their best gear while they afkd
[3:17:13] Drathimos: it's gotta be something that isnt phased like that. something that can be seen in public
[3:17:19] Old_Tomatoes: Im surprised they never bothered with just an instance portal and call it a day, give you furniture to play with then leave
[3:17:50] Drathimos: the way he explained housing sounded very enticing, its gona be the new evergreen end game incentive feature

[3:48:44] trollmasta66: @Drathimos I did at first, until I looked at global count and he was using silence on me over and over... and I'm a warrior...
[3:50:01] trollmasta66: I didn't think much of it until he was using silence on only me the last two games and lost those last two. So I checked globals and rotation. He was running the same rotation, but I guess the bot broke because instead of runnning the cc rotation on the healer, it switched to me.

[4:19:18] Drathimos: i think it would be weird to hide such a huge feature like housing out of the upcoming expac pitch. they might add like initial smaller systems soon but the full fledged housing system wont be in until midnight
[4:19:51] Drathimos: yeah but at least they said the expacs will be quicker

[5:35:59] squire394: incredibly impressive you guys got as far as you did without countering dh with dh - shows how good you guys really are
[5:37:19] squire394: at no discredit to echo ofc, its just quite clear that extra dh damage was the fine line between win/lose
[5:38:24] opticalaccuarcy: General thoughts on the tuning? sorry im late
[5:38:40] opticalaccuarcy: HeyGuys
[5:42:14] squire394: i guess so yeah, would be interesting to see what would happen if it played out again - hard to tell without seeing the changes live
[5:45:32] RotkidAU: I was the resto shaman
[5:45:32] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[5:45:34] RotkidAU: Lovely
[5:48:21] Szain3: DinoDance
[5:49:46] pathowatch: Sup Mes, hope it all dissipates quickly.
[5:50:23] squire394: its tough to see that they find a bug with dh before they find the tuning issues with DK - i miss seeing you on the AWC screen man. I'm hoping this ret/war/fw pans out well if we dont see dk changes soon
[5:50:29] pathowatch: I seek sun when sick
[5:52:37] pathowatch: I feel the buff to mages buffs hunters.
[5:52:59] crusadein: you think ww/dk/rsham can ball better than pairing with a DH or an outlaw
[5:54:49] itssNezumi: i mean is DH even gonna be viable anymore after patch?
[5:55:02] squire394: ahh i see, its sad to see - it seems like there needs to be more communication on blizzards behalf, both to us and internally seems like they're chopping off the elbow and not realising it affects the hand
[5:58:17] crusadein: kind of wish they just removed DHs passive wall talent. cheesy they just get dmg reduction just cause their purple.
[5:59:08] squire394: i get you, I'm just an eu andy thats barely touched his toes into pvp just trying to get a grasp on things. i guess you cant see positive change without any change at all, its a good start. It'd be nice to see some more frequent changes even if its biweekly
[6:00:59] TheEyeVII: is dh dead on tues?
[6:02:01] TheEyeVII: isn't it just defensives and 10% on EB which is nothing really? or did I miss something
[6:05:08] itssNezumi: everyone getting off DH on tuesday xD
[6:05:12] xiliketurtlex: 2 tier set bug fixed. applies 50% in pvp
[6:05:31] xiliketurtlex: which applies to soulscar
[6:05:47] xiliketurtlex: so overall less damage for dh on reset
[6:05:47] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[6:07:10] TheEyeVII: off dh & on ret, cuz for no reason they buffed that by 20%
[6:07:28] everquest101: people should be happy for nerfs should be happy for buffs to get other classes  to  be bettter
[6:07:37] Solushun: we love ret/war!
[6:11:14] TheEyeVII: it's gonna be ret/war & demo/frost mage, so much better than dh comps at least dewTrig ...
[6:13:34] everquest101: the  thing is every time dk  got a  buff they nuked it leavin it  even worse status it was then it ebcome less played class and in last balance patch it gets 0 attention
[6:17:24] DOGGFOOD69: hey mes are the dh nerf big?
[6:18:07] rosina_scarlett: that ret damage my lord
[6:18:37] sunileif: kill the rogue!
[6:18:46] sunileif: kill him good and hard!

[6:21:48] sunileif: so its a possibility?
[6:21:52] sunileif: ;D
[6:21:58] curseofthemorningwood: Just hope the nerf on DH will bring them closer to other dps classes
[6:22:06] mouro52: WHich best in shuffle atm? Between ret/war/dk?
[6:22:50] ItsYaBoyOOH: rsham
[6:23:03] sunileif: hmmm sub rogue needs a nerf
[6:23:16] ItsYaBoyOOH: didnt realize amb talent is nerfed by 50% in pvp too lol
[6:23:44] elitemanslayerx: bottom line if mes is backseating dk reroll :P
[6:24:23] curseofthemorningwood: Seems like unholy is pretty decent most expansions
[6:24:24] sunileif: @elitemanslayerx mes crushed a pvp dev's dreams now dk is cursed
[6:24:28] ItsYaBoyOOH: feral mage and mage boomie/ lock
[6:24:43] mouro52: So both ret/warr is better than DKs now?
[6:25:09] mouro52: That makes me sad
[6:25:20] curseofthemorningwood: Just wish we could get a classic version of legion
[6:25:25] mouro52: I wanna play frost dk with obli but i hate using the bouncy ability
[6:25:26] rosina_scarlett: War seems very squishy for PvP right now. Most I see just fall over
[6:25:44] TheEyeVII: the dh 2p thing was a bug but it's just pad throw glaive dmg, that thing buffs EB and burst? which that is just nerfed by 10% goes from 250k to 225k deathsweep, right?
[6:25:45] RotkidAU: mes bro every spec has to be good at everything now. might aswell delete classes
[6:26:11] Glowerss: The 2p was not pad at all it's like 20% of their damage
