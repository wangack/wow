[0:27:44] Lichcult: eating a spinach wrap with agave mustard Kreygasm
[0:27:55] glutenrich69: Potassium is a mineral that your body needs to work properly. It is a type of electrolyte. It helps your nerves to function and muscles to contract. It helps your heartbeat stay regular. It also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells.
[0:27:56] goopunch: potasium is an electrolyte I think

[0:40:03] Renfuryy: what you eat even affects your mental health. high refined carbohydrates are linked to increased anxiety

[0:40:36] Veriance: fuegoHi
[0:40:46] CuBicCal: debi looks sober fuegoHehe
[0:40:59] Lichcult: @Renfuryy for sure but i'd be willing to bet that it's also correlated with sedentary lifestyles which, i'd argue, is a bigger driving factor to high anxiety
[0:41:31] DesiHeat: fuegoHi
[0:41:43] Renfuryy: kinda the same but there's different ways to eat carbs, everything in fast food is bad
[0:41:47] Arlhachedhel: hello

[0:43:12] Renfuryy: @Renfuryy kermitNODDERS
[0:44:03] Lichcult: @Renfuryy i just think too much fixation on diet is bad, the most important thing is to exercise an hour a day. if i had to choose which is more important, i'd say exercise everytime
[0:44:08] Dynamics831: you should go get another tri tip salad desi Tasty
[0:44:49] Dynamics831: you cant outwork a bad diet tho
[0:45:05] Lichcult: @Dynamics831 you can if you run 5 miles everyday KEKW try it
[0:45:21] Dynamics831: it's not sustainable
[0:45:23] Renfuryy: @Lichcult I agree, there's a lot of proven benefits to exercise. overall, balance is key, both with diet and exercise

[1:11:16] xephur: Just an FYI most of the Bloodmoon items are Unique-Equipped: Bloodmoon(1) so you can't equip the MH and OH.

[1:16:39] Renfuryy: if everyone has more hp, abilities deal less % of your hp
[1:16:52] Elijahss: On reset ya.  Druids, pallies, Shaman, and mages are getting buffed.  I guess the pally buffs already happened.

[5:46:03] Elijahss: @Renfuryy that's why if you are early you never get layered like this

[6:19:40] Megtorr: where did u lost your glass?
[6:19:43] IDrink2Much: Good evening Desi! hope youre having a good night so far

[6:22:49] Arriv003: lulz - I saw the listing for the earthquake but it said, "Ontario, CA" and I thought Ontario Canada LUL
[6:23:01] nickas31: just hit 29 on my priest
[6:23:01] DesiHeat: fuegoHi
[6:23:18] pinatairl: i visited texas once and i thought i experienced earthquake, turns out it was spacex testing rockets 20 miles away- everything was shaking inside the cabinets
[6:24:19] RealSiggs: PogT
[6:24:23] MitchJones: <3
[6:25:15] pinatairl: i never experienced real earthquake
[6:25:17] Jake96: im great thank you sorry for late reply
[6:25:28] Arriv003: It's hot in Texas. Hot and humid
[6:25:32] Renfuryy: @pinatairl I havent either, hard to imagine without experiencing it
[6:25:32] Bashoot: thats whats up, thats mitch jones whaaa KEKsweat
[6:26:29] Arriv003: I never knew air conditioned seats were a thing until I got it as an option on my rental car in TX. Air conditioned seats are an amazing experience!
[6:26:40] RealSiggs: KEKsweat shadow priests thinking about the incoming nerf KEKsweat
[6:26:57] Renfuryy: kermitNODDERS
[6:27:03] Rhythmicx1: seismograph
[6:27:08] Bashoot: richter scale
[6:27:20] pinatairl: @Arriv003 is it just cooling or actually ventilating?
[6:27:24] Renfuryy: whats the safest place to be during an earthquake?
[6:27:37] Bashoot: @Renfuryy another country
[6:27:43] pinatairl: like 5km off shore
[6:27:44] Renfuryy: KEKL
[6:27:45] pinatairl: or  in air
[6:27:45] Elijahss: under a strong desk maybe
[6:27:48] krasserwas: consider moving to a safer place? :D
[6:27:51] Arriv003: @pinatairl the seats blow cold air up your hoo-ha!
[6:28:06] rankjuann: Has probado patatas chips y lonchas de queso?
[6:28:07] Rhythmicx1: a good place is under your desk in your situation
[6:28:18] Bashoot: outside is safe tho i think cuz if the building collapses
[6:28:18] Rhythmicx1: protect your neck and head
[6:28:21] Renfuryy: monkaW
[6:28:22] pinatairl: @pinatairl sounds insane, i need that in my gamer chair
[6:28:24] ZhaTheStreamer: how's your night desi?
[6:28:29] Farikov: Yo
[6:28:47] ZhaTheStreamer: i try to say i'd help people, like i helped someone once who got hit by a car
[6:29:04] Farikov: how are u doing
[6:29:12] paannzz: alliance on this server sucks
[6:29:18] Renfuryy: im wondering where if youre home, like I know for tornados youre supposed to go into a basement if you can, or a center room in the house
[6:29:28] rankjuann: Is the boomkins a problem? Hahaha
[6:29:36] paannzz: doorways
[6:29:40] ZhaTheStreamer: maybe it's just too early desi?
[6:29:50] pinatairl: @Renfuryy im p sure in asia where theyre very prone to it they go outside
[6:29:50] Arriv003: gotta get geared and then you'll be strong
[6:29:51] Renfuryy: im hoping gear balances it out, im dying faster than I was in phase 1 with no abilities xff
[6:30:01] Elijahss: Isnt AB a horde favored BG?  I dont remember losing very much.  and WSG is/was the opposite.
[6:30:04] Farikov: Coolies
[6:30:13] ZhaTheStreamer: boomkins always broken in pvp imo
[6:30:16] Arriv003: Are you in full plate yet?
[6:30:28] Renfuryy: Theres a forum post right now asking for blizz to put in a flat % dmg reduction into pvp
[6:30:36] ZhaTheStreamer: good point
[6:30:40] ZhaTheStreamer: you full plate desi?
[6:30:46] Elijahss: @Renfuryy that should revert it
[6:31:11] Arriv003: well, okay then! Once you get full plate gear, the rogues will cry
[6:31:18] Renfuryy: like resil basically
[6:31:19] shadotdow: just googled, 2024/02/15 23:38:40 - there was actually an earthquake with magnitude 3.8 in CA
[6:31:36] Arriv003: There are lv40 plate items
[6:31:42] dipchit1: flat % is not like resil, resil nerfs crits way harder which is super lame
[6:31:48] Elijahss: phase 1 had a flat % dmg reduction
[6:31:52] Elijahss: in BGs
[6:32:06] Renfuryy: @dipchit1 thats true
[6:32:35] Elijahss: week 1 or 2
[6:32:38] daimonds3: yo
[6:32:42] Jake96: hows the bgs going?
[6:32:48] DesiHeat: fuegoHi
[6:33:05] Arriv003: @Elijahss that makes sense if true. I saw some of the wsg fights Desi was in and was thinking, "How are these lasting soo long?"?
[6:33:13] Renfuryy: we could try a wsg, it might also be that theres more people in an AB
[6:33:17] Jake96: fuegoHi @daimonds3
[6:33:26] dipchit1: id like to see a stam rebalance like in tbc, where each pt of stam is worth less ilevel than other stats
[6:33:27] Jake96: well fuck thats annoying
[6:33:28] Renfuryy: 15 people instead of 10
[6:34:02] Arriv003: YEP
[6:34:03] Fossabot: YEP
[6:34:18] Arriv003: There's a good hammer off the pummeler in Gnomer

[6:34:40] daimonds3: someone typed on me, and ill just say, that i have no idea how this site works, i just joined after 8 years of not using it
[6:34:45] JC0830: Gn Desi. Sorry I haven't been active very much lately.  Supposedly finishing the new house in the next couple weeks 🤷🏼‍♂️

[6:41:42] Elijahss: maybe it would
[6:41:59] CookiesOnDowels: Nessie fuegoRave fuegoPls
[6:42:25] scorpibrot: if they give warr  bladestorm...he can be A tier
[6:42:37] skymtv: damn sod pvp is so dogshit
[6:42:51] eneyeseakaywhy20: hows the sod grind
[6:44:11] chris091: its insane. slam hist hard and compared to MS only costs 15rage.
[6:44:23] eneyeseakaywhy20: are you still on crusdaer strike?
[6:45:14] Elijahss: I really like the current version of Blood Moon
[6:45:43] kenzellbtw: did they fix blood moon btw?
[6:45:57] Elijahss: isnt MS just for the debuff
[6:46:03] Arriv003: Is it because you don't have a strong weapon?
[6:46:09] Elijahss: in SoD
[6:46:16] Renfuryy: the debuff makes it impossible to heal through with the amount of dmg from everything else right now
[6:46:28] Renfuryy: I could probably go oom and not get you to 100% hp through ms
[6:46:42] Begrooved: MS doesn't hit very hard in classic/sod
[6:46:46] Elijahss: I never got to go arm too much to Classic on my Warrior, I was always tanking
[6:46:49] rankjuann: try WSG desi
[6:46:50] Begrooved: for the rage cost*
[6:46:52] Renfuryy: im down for whatever
[6:47:14] Begrooved: but the healing debuff is oppressive
[6:47:39] wormaldson: probably gonna win DonkSass
[6:47:43] jimbology: lotta people need wsg exalted for bracers tbh
[6:47:43] Renfuryy: theres 10 people instead of 15, might feel different
[6:47:49] jimbology: probably a lot of people queueing it
[6:47:56] Arriv003: oh yea, wsg bracers were really good at 40
[6:48:20] Jake96: oooof love me some warsong
[6:48:23] Renfuryy: theres 25 instances of AB and 20 of WSG right now
[6:48:31] Renfuryy: yes duel me
[6:48:34] Elijahss: I am all good either way, I actually still need a lot of WSG rep
[6:48:41] Jake96: hahaha jeez nice dad joke haha

[6:56:00] Ehnaton1: am i trippin or do you have a new hairstyle hair color every other stream ?
[6:56:09] Arriv003: I think SoD cannibalized a lot of the wrath player base. It'll pick back up when cata is released
[6:56:34] Ehnaton1: every other day i'd say
[6:56:44] Herathas: good morning :D

[6:58:08] ZhaTheStreamer: ruby was boring
[6:58:14] Ehnaton1: maybe i am just misremembering
[6:58:19] Elijahss: SoD will still be a thing on Cata release
[6:58:20] Arriv003: I try to log into wrath most every day, but I just can't motivate myself to do anything
[6:58:43] DevilDolls: I don't think cata will have half the wotlk launch player count
[6:58:47] paannzz: Ruby sanctum is SO much trash for 1 boss
[6:59:02] jimbology: i am for sure, icc drops my trinkets and cool sword NODDERS
[6:59:20] jimbology: all ruby sanctum gives me is a cloak and some bracers, psh
[6:59:25] Arriv003: @DevilDolls wotlk really was peak wow
