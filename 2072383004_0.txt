[5:27:08] Mystylerocks: with meta
[5:27:10] primisus69: demon form looks cool what else do you need
[5:27:21] Itrulia: you dont give up on fear technically, you give up on mana :D
[5:27:40] Holtann: But I have to play my Illídân character :(
[5:27:43] varatupaj: if you dont play meta you get onetapped by classies presssing one button as well - melee hunters, rogues etc
[5:27:47] Mystylerocks: i mean.. meta is like almost 1/3 of your mana if not more. u only have the aoe fear
[5:27:55] varatupaj: but meta is boring as fuck thats true
[5:28:18] NoxyCookie: but rogues and hunters are also squishy as fucj
[5:28:18] Nezzy243: @varatupaj so does every other caster minus mage
[5:28:39] NoxyCookie: meta is tanky as hell and just pains you down xdd
[5:28:52] varatupaj: soul link with haunt is pretty good but 2 sec cast on corruption is so painfull
[5:29:12] Nezzy243: yeah theres other problems
[5:29:17] Nezzy243: like warlocks still exist
[5:29:21] savage23z: Hey Hydra long time fan. Whats the addon above your player frame showing what spell you're pressing?
[5:29:39] Creampuff1112: like mage spamming frostbolt as its only ability in Vanilla pve
[5:29:45] snayrofficial: play  like a mage
[5:29:48] snayrofficial: lol
[5:30:02] Itrulia: my fav thing to do against noob meta warlocks is to fear them with my warrior once the lifedrain goes out, outrange it and go back in. They panic so hard
[5:30:12] primisus69: how is the ele going?

[5:30:32] Itrulia: or dispelling it on my priest
[5:30:37] Nezzy243: @Itrulia i love when one presses it on my priest and i dispel, watching them run in fear is fucking hilarious
[5:30:40] Nezzy243: LMAO
[5:30:44] Nezzy243: read my mind
[5:31:16] Itrulia: especially if they open with it
