[2:24:08] Cliptons: for a game and studio of this scale with this production value, i'd expect it to do more
[2:24:09] AzzinothXXX: 100 million is good for a small indie russian dev

[2:30:12] DigDu6: @MeltedDoubt i thought so too
[2:30:13] yergoood: @oletule car extracts as pmc. pmc-scav extracts. Extracting as scav also gives rep.
[2:30:14] Raf_Giraffe: wait scav levels separately?
[2:30:15] StreamElements: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[2:30:15] fearghan: Are you even playing the game if your scav doesn’t have kappa
[2:30:18] outlaaz: @okaywellokay thats not possible without leveling your pmc because some upgrades are locked behind pmc levels
[2:30:19] UberknallerTV: @brysonl999 I know the feelings kek
[2:30:19] SneakyFiend_: @oletule u have to kill every scavs on map while being a scav
[2:30:19] HEMIN6WAY: and you can run with the bosses when you have 6.0 scav rep
[2:30:22] ToxikToad: Scav lvl ppl. Not scav rep
[2:30:23] MeltedDoubt: you can level up ur scav????? O_O
[2:30:23] optimuspottery: @Raf_Giraffe yes
[2:30:24] Daggerx1x: that was a bug
[2:30:25] igamenightly: you have to level your pmc in order to max the hideout though
[2:30:25] Rewdawakening: "KekW !" - Bless you.
[2:30:25] SteremyJeele: It's also not possible LUL You need to get rep and levels with traders to max the hideout.
[2:30:26] MambasTherapy: that's not possible
[2:30:26] PapaGrim1: scav is where i make money lol
[2:30:27] ManULegend18: That sounds like bs lol
[2:30:30] SashaAustin: They should make a Lirik nade
[2:30:32] MambasTherapy: you need trader rep
[2:30:33] sunjo_hsk: what is the point of doing hideout if youre only gonna scav
[2:30:33] AbelDenibus: shrouds SCAV higher than my PMC LUL
[2:30:33] spaid7: That's not possible? lol
[2:30:33] Cadalso: max hideout wouldn't be possible scav only
[2:30:33] SavageExpiry: if it was on TikTok it has to be real
[2:30:36] EpicBatmanNinja: i mostly do my looting on scav. PMC is for pvp and questing LUL
[2:30:38] tjc240a: scav queues are like 45secs
[2:30:39] CafePatron: yeah you have hit traders Levels to get Hideout upgrades so thats not possible lol
[2:30:40] okaywellbuh: @outlaaz thats what i thought but he showed zero pmc raids
[2:30:41] NivekFPS: im at 6.7 now
[2:30:41] UberknallerTV: -2.0 scav rep here
[2:30:42] Qaliar: you need PMC skill levels to upgrade hideout
[2:30:47] ViTo_855: Take Taxi Extracts
[2:30:48] ToxikToad: My highest was lvl 21
[2:30:48] Sazuke__: @shroud I killed 3 very juicy pmc's last night, had 2 kitted m4"s and a lone star. It was fun, they probably uninstalled XD
[2:30:49] outlaaz: @okaywellokay ok but its literally not possible
[2:30:49] actualop: i think fps_shaka has like 7 or 12 idk

[2:30:49] mariuszenigma: how do you reload without droping magazine?
[2:30:53] spaid7: Im at 7.4 scav rep now.
[2:30:55] HEMIN6WAY: its  a grind, but so cool to fight with the bosses and scoop up the loot
[2:30:56] Daggerx1x: that tik tok was a bug, you dont get any "PMC loadout" as a scav ever
[2:30:56] PBRbiter: above 6 is fun. you can chill with scav bosses and bait pmc's
[2:30:58] hipsi85: can't you team up with random Scavs during Lobby? @shroud

[2:38:38] ociifer: probably make less gear fear for new players
[2:38:40] hipsi85: probably server performance reasons for that . ..
[2:38:40] Poeti: @Blazeit420SwagNoScopezXXX  OMEGALUL
[2:38:40] SteremyJeele: There are loose backpack spawns, they're just very rare.
[2:38:41] SparkleTheatre: I've seen a lot of guns laying against the gun boxes lately
[2:38:45] Cooksleyplayer: More loose loot for sure
[2:38:46] KontrolStyle: that'd be cool

[2:38:47] flirtle: lil scav encampments

[2:38:51] OrcalaFF: DayZ type rare gun spawns

[2:38:59] thejubilex: theres a loose backpack spawn at the scav town next to the bunker on woods, and then an mbss spawns on the boat on the pier at shoreline
[2:38:59] l_DMC_l: also loot should be random
[2:39:01] KontrolStyle: that's so old
[2:39:03] Ducstin: truuueeeee
[2:39:03] Azepzep: even low quality loot would help new players
[2:39:05] vinicius_mi: and also allot more scavs
[2:39:05] Igelkotte: loot should be everywhere
[2:39:07] Yell0w_Sn0w: 5 fps  then

[2:39:18] Banndido: make game much better
[2:39:19] pi0noplee: dayz
[2:39:20] EntropyB: Agreed. Loose loot locations should be all over the map and randomly spawn
[2:39:20] ThePiter333: random / dynamic loot
[2:39:21] Twinklestar5: but it is already like that lol, you just know all spawns
[2:39:25] deathwush: would be cool would also kill the servers even more
[2:39:27] araoq: u mean random loot?
[2:39:28] CoolieRanks: But does too much loose loot make it warzone?
[2:39:29] MrJorgeWBush: shroud the beast?!!
[2:39:30] imswaye: so more of a dynamic loot spawning
[2:39:30] boostservices: or u swap to dayz and all good
[2:39:31] MrJorgeWBush: !!!
[2:39:31] valrash1981: With perma spawns in certain area's for certain items.
[2:39:32] yislerr: !time
[2:39:33] StreamElements: @yislerr, Mike's local time is: 04:04:14 PM PST
[2:39:33] mjerticla: Dayz style
[2:39:36] JeebieBeebies: Yeah, lot more spawns, low chance for any spawn to have anything
[2:39:40] Poogieboy1: should be like pubg
[2:39:43] waty0usay: that would make the game incredibly boring
[2:39:44] Bujafu: so more loot or more random
[2:39:49] karbonkyle: shirley
[2:39:49] MangoPickle: what kind of coffee you drink shrood?? PauseChamp

[2:39:56] revbenji2: Clueless surely
[2:39:56] SoldierR6: Clueless
[2:39:57] RaisingCainz: creating dynamic loot spawns like that takes time
[2:39:58] CPatRan: And don't call me Shirley
[2:40:01] n0rthbandit: I already fill my bag in the first 5 mins lol
[2:40:02] shogo_han: there's a spot on that roof
[2:40:02] freque22: yah, there should be more random loot, and less quality perpetual loot spawns
[2:40:04] RedNuker: shroudM
[2:40:04] dietn5: or he knows and hes still hiding and exploiting
[2:40:05] freque22: spread the wealth

[2:40:07] CrazyjeanALV: quest shotgun check? no need?
[2:40:08] Twinklestar5: well for me it feels like it's everywhere but it's my first wipe
[2:40:09] Azhriel: how does he intend on finding the invisible guy if he's invisible?
[2:40:09] TheFuns1: @CPatRan shut up you
[2:40:10] swankyburgerr: @waty0usay Not at all, What makes it boring is everything always spawning in the same places
[2:40:11] CPatRan: Classic airplane joke
[2:40:12] pitbadger: The only place I know that spawns kitted guns is Kiba but they’re behind 2 doors you need keys for
[2:40:14] Tarheel: yea but then u get oversaturated with loot, so it make sying less of a concern cause u can find shit everywhere

[2:40:40] thejubilex: thats what happens when invisible people loot things
[2:40:41] mutedmedic: u stopped searching because u moved stuff into the bag
[2:40:43] looterwins: invisable player bugged unsearchable loot
[2:40:44] Koffiekoekje: Wtf was that a flashlight on the SKS, is that possible? LUL
[2:40:44] artanoswiz: @shroud Tekk the rig, your armor is fkked anyways
[2:40:44] aSickHuman: prob the invis guy's loot
[2:40:49] KontrolStyle: damn that's a pretty bad bug
[2:40:50] manclr4ke: to summ1t in two diff occations, one that hutch was killed by a invi guy that summ1t could see(so 2 POVs of the thingy), and summ1t not being seen by a guy with a thermo, you can see it in the end of summ stream last nite

[2:40:52] JohnDashack: invis guy prob took those
[2:40:53] mutedmedic: oh, nvm.

[2:40:59] Banndido: thay have so much work and the game is still beta after 5 years
[2:41:00] MangoPickle: monkaHmm

[2:41:07] BatteryAcidLoL: that backpack is a worse 12 slot backpack now
[2:41:07] RedNuker: so weird
[2:41:08] iamlegend069: the inv guy glitched the loot
[2:41:09] waty0usay: @swankyburgerr you don't seem to understand the traffic in this game
[2:41:10] CallMeHuff: that use to be a search skill trick for exp
[2:41:12] Rewdawakening: Dead cells
[2:41:13] x1dragonx: Cause the invis guy looted them!!! @shroud
[2:41:13] dietn5: scav boss ?
[2:41:13] swineninety9: Thats how they fixed the Rubber banding, just make is so you can't see anyone rubber banding.
[2:41:16] mourtzoudis536: so that's what happened to me yesterday

[2:41:27] MonozBeatz: @Banndido its almost 13 years now my guy
[2:41:27] Soliel: He's not saying ADD more loot to eh already existing pool . Just have it in more random spots. Gives a bigger insensitive to explore other areas.
[2:41:38] KontrolStyle: YEP
[2:41:47] Versified: KEKW
[2:41:55] bobtheimpaler: @Soliel incentive
[2:41:56] FaonPage: looks like DayZ type of curse
[2:42:02] waty0usay: @swankyburgerr if you have to scan every pixel on every map to find loot worth 5k roubles, nobody would play this game
[2:42:07] Soliel: @BobTehImpaler  yep that too
[2:42:13] bobtheimpaler: ;)
[2:42:14] Banndido: @MonozBeatz no shot released as alpha in 2016
[2:42:20] madpickl3: can you kill invisible guy, or he is immune to dmg too?
[2:42:25] boxOkrumm: Need energy
[2:42:27] swankyburgerr: @waty0usay Bros not cooking at all
[2:42:27] Soliel: sumNice sumS
[2:42:32] JeebieBeebies: @Soliel yeah, could make stashes just have food, meds, ammo, and spawn more stuff loose
[2:42:38] EchoCreep: do even they fix stuf or patch is just for bait
[2:43:08] SteremyJeele: They patched one of the issues leading to the bug, but obviously not the whole thing yet.
[2:43:13] Scoochhy: SeemsGood
[2:43:20] Soliel: @JeebieBeebies yea,so many areas on all maps just get passed by due ot NO loot or just plain trash.
[2:43:22] Soliel: to
[2:43:25] swankyburgerr: Streets is huge but only like 2 buildings are worth looting
[2:43:28] valrash1981: He was through here.

[3:00:26] ApexAiry: @Gumrick ? have you? because the initial recoil is the most dificult part. Once it levels out its pretty easy to stay on target on full auto. If you burst you deal with that each time

[4:33:27] General_HAM: honeslty games could be the same way if they wanted to prob
[4:33:28] LordPoseidon1204: Ikr...one day my songs gnna play on your stream
[4:33:30] Chatting0nAaYoinkedPhone: damn there's still a likelihood for dmca even if u don't vod ur streams, that's insane
[4:33:30] JerseyBricklayer: u turned off t swift, unacceptable
[4:33:33] acemagex: The only side it makes sense is the side where antiquated record labels control the current copyright system :)
[4:33:45] mushironi: why did twitch have to mask their metallica concert that one time on livestream then
[4:33:45] outsideinsiders: Just song along to all the songs and claim Articistic expression rights? Big 🧠👍
[4:33:46] StreamElements: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[4:33:48] fakechatter: They get less money now that streaming is popular so they have to squeeze whatever they can
[4:33:49] Rudy3276: Many men have been turned off by T Swift
[4:33:53] worm45s: @hawk_moth it's not exactly about the source but the audio channel that you use

[4:34:06] DarkKraken69: @Vertxel Twitch doesn't care. The only time that they took action was when the massive DMCA strikes came down. They removed everyones strikes and started working on a system to help streamers. It wasn't twitch though that helped, it was the people who made OBS, and Stream Elements that really came through
[4:34:14] Rudy3276: He shook her off
[4:34:16] steezycheese: its 2 shot burst
