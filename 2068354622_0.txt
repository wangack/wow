[0:16:11] zoegoTV: not in germany either tho
[0:16:20] zoegoTV: would be sick tho
[0:16:36] kaukos: Imagine instead of mooses we would have alpackas running around widl
[0:16:39] zoegoTV: the wool is r1
[0:17:12] notmorbos: yea if anyone needs a few sacks of unrefined, raw alpaca wool
[0:17:18] notmorbos: my dads too lazy to do anything with it

[0:18:21] zoegoTV: syntetic is shit
[0:18:25] pdavidsen: thats why all my clothes are made of asbestos ratirlRain
[0:18:36] notmorbos: idk modern sheep and alpaca are bred in a way that they would actually die if you dont shear the wool yearly
[0:18:44] zoegoTV: exactly
[0:18:45] notmorbos: so were at a point were its kinda doomed either way
[0:19:01] notmorbos: although i agree in principle

[0:20:51] notmorbos: if by "genetically modified" you mean bred for generations to do exactly that, then yes
[0:21:06] notmorbos: but no crazy scifi gene modification
[0:21:12] utbiu: 70 billion chicken are killed every year sadge

[0:33:34] UndeadKillerTBC: was playing casually first 3 months
[0:34:02] kaukos: bracket 1 means highest honor spot every week
[0:34:10] UndeadKillerTBC: went full degen mode during covid
[0:34:35] UndeadKillerTBC: ye was fun times ngl
[0:34:43] ekunx: so you have to be among the few dudes with most honor every week for 3 months
[0:34:43] UndeadKillerTBC: premades with friends
[0:34:45] ekunx: Wheezy

[0:36:42] kaukos: it means you had to get 1.7mil honor for the reset
[0:36:46] UndeadKillerTBC: 1.7 mil honor in 1 week
[0:36:50] infrex1: In Cata dispel is also different. You can cast it on someone who doesn't have any debuffs, so you cannot "predispel" a HoJ or smth

[0:39:56] notmorbos: well idk exactly what level other things are set to, but at the highest setting it will be in front of map and other menus as well
[0:40:02] zelraftw: you finally get bauble of pally i see

[2:34:28] Raikubest: Think in modern expansions the late seasons are actually by far the worst but ur logic works up until like Legion
[2:35:47] Raikubest: Cuz i think s1-s4 legion was better than rest of legion, and bfa s1 was by far best bfa season, Shadowlands s2 was best season (s3-s4 garbage) and DF s1 > s2 > s3

[2:42:20] Raikubest: complete garbage game
[2:42:36] ear_shot: u need dopamine
[2:42:41] saubur: sounds like cata @raikubest
[2:43:02] Raikubest: So this just makes it so that no one wants to play at all right

[2:43:56] Urpalmax: Blizzard just believes in you
[2:43:57] Raikubest: then ever since no one plays
[2:44:09] Raikubest: Solo shuffle is worse, u can go like 50-24 winrate and ur going down in rating
[2:44:12] ktp_blue: if you were just bad like me you'd never run out of progress KEKW
[2:44:20] Raikubest: and solo shuffle r1 was the same since January 2nd

[2:45:34] Urpalmax: @Raikubest why no play wrath? I hear Johnnybanana is playing
[2:45:47] ktp_blue: it both sucks...and can be good? It's nice to have options of what game to play at any one time. Why be locked down by just one version of wow!
[2:46:30] simstarx: simstarx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! noooo faking auto sub is still on i gotta fix this
[2:46:36] Simmshady: @ktp_blue separates the community far too much
[2:46:46] scorp1onxtrem: wut the mmr is going up but you get 0 rating ?
[2:46:49] simstarx: peepoClap
[2:47:08] simstarx: how r Jonte today
[2:47:14] shizophrenla: wth 10 games 0 raiting :O
[2:47:20] ktp_blue: for each individual i think it's good. from the mmo perspective...yea many group-mechanics that are participation dependent will suffer
[2:48:00] Kalimboo: you will get points next game btw
[2:48:12] Raikubest: AWC is only 2 cups + finals (s3) and 2 cups + finals (s4) and the reason for less tournaments cuz ppl complained is because there will be 3 AWC seasons (S1 war within AWC)

[2:48:42] ktp_blue: this was about..."is it good that retail/cata out at the same time" raiku mentioned
[2:49:07] Turaxyy: sadge
[2:49:45] Raikubest: no so usually they do this always they do 4 cups + finals and 4 cups per  finals
[2:49:46] Raikubest: every year
[2:49:53] Raikubest: but this year they are doing 3 AWCs
[2:50:03] faint_be: gratz on hotter streak
[2:50:15] simstarx: less per season
[2:50:32] Raikubest: its less per season but its 1 more season
[2:51:05] simstarx: more pressure to perform i bet? @Raikubest not many chances to gather points
[2:51:30] j4fmate: can you play a game as female dwarf pls? :)
[2:51:30] Raikubest: its good i think yea because usually the break from AWC is very long and now its abit shorter breaks
[2:51:37] Raikubest: we got 2nd yea

[2:52:11] loafoath: + 0 everytime
[2:52:21] Kalimboo: win next game and you will get points !!
[2:52:30] kenniflopper: @Raikubest Cata soon EZ
[2:52:33] Raikubest: Demonhunter and Outlaw rogue are the only 2 good dps specs in the game and resto shaman is the only good healer
[2:52:39] vitpro: when is meta not dogshit on retail kekw
[2:52:52] Raikubest: The game is so bad
[2:53:11] arenasheep: it reflect the real world too
[2:53:15] notmorbos: its the cata -> mop -> riot mmo pipeline
[2:53:18] Raikubest: and CC dosnt matter at all because healer trinket is 90 secs and cc is so short since s2 of DF
[2:53:19] notmorbos: dont cope for war within
[2:53:27] Raikubest: so u cant even win on skill u win on damage done
[2:53:28] Srenix: Next expansion gonna be insane though
[2:53:32] Turaxyy: I mean on wrath only warrior is a good dps right
[2:53:33] Raikubest: cuz u cant win on CC
[2:53:35] simstarx: it has potential though, but they aren't changing frequently enough
[2:53:39] ear_shot: the cope within
[2:53:44] saubur: @srenix srenixPOOOG
[2:54:08] Raikubest: Cyclone is the only good CC in the game xDDDDDDD (6 secs as always)
[2:54:27] Raikubest: its the longest cc, cant be dispelled and cannot break from dmg

[2:54:39] Turaxyy: ^^
[2:54:42] ktp_blue: some day you gotta do the hydra special and do disc double mage 3s KEKW
[2:54:44] XerineTV: @Srenix Cata or war within?
[2:54:57] Raikubest: poly from 10 secs in wotlk to 6 in DF
[2:55:04] Raikubest: but all ur dmg spells in DF is AOE
[2:55:07] Raikubest: even as mage
[2:55:15] Urpalmax: @Raikubest are you sure you are not just doing DR sheep
[2:55:34] Raikubest: the game is dogshit, i dont think the game was ever this bad
[2:56:01] ear_shot: is gaming dead?
[2:56:17] Urpalmax: dont worry next xpac will make this one seem better
[2:56:35] nivalen292: life is dead
[2:56:50] bamboonas: Is it bad I enjoyed season 1 bfa more than all of wotlk and df?
[2:57:04] notmorbos: s1 bfa was solid
[2:57:11] Raikubest: s1 bfa was actually not bad except for how op rshaman was
[2:57:31] Turaxyy: I think ertail canno't change into a good game at this point
[2:57:36] Srenix: BFA was quite fun, RMP superstrong though
[2:57:41] Srenix: RMP a little too strong
[2:57:42] ravine77: s4 bfa with buyable corruptions was also quite nice
[2:57:49] bamboonas: Cata and mop was the golden ages of pvp though
[2:58:06] Raikubest: WOD was best pvp expansion
[2:58:11] Srenix: Wasnt it like RMP and Turbo only in BFA S1
[2:58:18] Urpalmax: FULL 9 SEC KIDNEY RED BUFF KILLING SPREE
[2:58:26] Urpalmax: LOOK WHAT IM DOING TO HIM
[2:58:26] notmorbos: wod minus turbo wouldve been great. but maybe i was just bad
[2:58:32] Raikubest: BFA s1 best comp was dh boomy rsham
[2:58:36] Raikubest: and RPS
[2:59:16] stacyer: @Raikubest was in s1 rsham was completely unkillable in ghost wolf?
[2:59:21] Raikubest: ye
[2:59:23] stacyer: :D
[2:59:54] drigo26: @raikubest why was wod?
[3:00:02] Urpalmax: cuz of wwdk
[3:00:13] Srenix: SOD Arena level 60, might be a thing
