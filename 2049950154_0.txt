[1:30:35] Snizzlenose: does ursine vigor have a cooldown?
[1:30:50] Blackgoose25: no
[1:33:01] seeddyybe: to play resto druid you don't stack any mastery at all?
[1:33:02] 27conv: there a few way to shift into cat form off gcd
[1:33:14] 27conv: like 4 or 5 abilities
[1:33:18] 27conv: tigers fury berzerk
[1:33:20] 27conv: dash

[1:37:56] seamonkie26: I timed a 21 EB with like 10 secs left the tank was just pulling small mobs like the beserkers by themselves
[1:38:14] ren0m: 29 EB?
[1:38:19] ren0m: Sounds doable
[1:38:34] ren0m: I though it gives more score
[1:38:45] Sorr08: Since you got on the tournament realm, do you plan on playing a couple different classes or just sticking to druid?
[1:38:51] DevotiionR: thaner was saying dic preist is only meta with aug evoker cause of the movement while casting spell, otherwise you struggle really hard

[1:40:20] LogikHQ: do you mostly pug your keys?
[1:40:50] ren0m: Why are Holy Priest not as popular? What are they missing compared to other healers?
[1:40:58] DevotiionR: drs ^
[1:41:59] reppap: Holy just doesn't AOE heal well, and damage is similar to disc
[1:42:32] ren0m: I tried pala and it felt weird, so I'll probably give my priest a go. So I guess I have to go disc.
[1:42:43] Snizzlenose: disc heals like a wet noodle without mindbender, so the 4p makes it real nice for mindbender uptime
[1:42:46] justbeachi: it's weird to me that anyone ever wants to play holy priest when disc is just always better
[1:43:18] ren0m: For me, disc just feels like you're a DPS that heals.
[1:43:37] ren0m: In contrast to other healers where you heal and when you have a chance you do dps.
[1:43:53] kelly_mac06: holy was so fucking good then
[1:43:57] kelly_mac06: omg
[1:44:33] Blazedude99: @ren0m isnt that the same with mw/pal ?

[1:45:57] kelly_mac06: sounds like cope
[1:46:20] spoon_rl: Thats a tweet if ive ever heard one
[1:46:46] kelly_mac06: lol yea i started the counter clockwise shit for that boss after inting for a while, so much easier
[1:47:00] prugar: DHs need an Irdikron simulator
[1:47:21] DevotiionR: disc really scares me when we go into a pull with no mindbender, heals are crappy
[1:48:35] kelly_mac06: YUP
[1:48:42] LogikHQ: bit easier for mobile healers though  - almost got caught out while casting on rsham yesterday lol

[2:37:52] Cruzerthebruzer: It's really nice not having to rely on people hitting a button
[2:38:01] razortanktv: cuz once you figure out the private aura its a non issue.
[2:38:06] Rypick: yea
[2:38:29] Maplewindz: It's a step in the right direction from blizz
[2:38:34] razortanktv: its really just undoing the original sin of even making it a private aura
[2:38:42] Cruzerthebruzer: In terms of pull count it probably doesn't matter at this point for your guild but it feels significantly better and maybe blizzard realize they're idiots
[2:39:45] Cruzerthebruzer: what a perfect song to wake up to
[2:39:58] HealsAndThat: I haven't even killed tindral yet, these Fyrakk nerfs are completely meaningless to me still :D

[3:00:28] eolin89: @juhakimyo y thats what i thought but still suprising. Should try it too in doti
[3:00:29] naturesremedy: @flawlesslykun Yeah, I have eyes thanks :D
[3:00:36] Celissah: I got a +27 ToTT on my rdruid, kinda scared to go into it. But will try today. Any tips for the dung? I've always had problem with the crushing depths.
[3:02:15] PrimerinoTV: you doing MDI jdot
[3:02:31] flawlesslykun: @naturesremedy you'd be surprised how many ppl don't :) also because u asked such a question, that's why i recomended such a thing. Usualy there is a stat you always stack (haste in the case of rdruid for m+, and vers if u going for dmg) but enchants is always something that usualy serves to bridge the gap of a stat you're missing, depending on what you are wearing
[3:04:19] naturesremedy: @flawlesslykun So then why is Jdot stacking crit?
[3:04:30] naturesremedy: I know the basics :)
[3:05:11] flawlesslykun: pretty sure he's not tho. the crit he has are from tierpieces (maybe another 489 piece from vault idk). i know he's a haste vers enjoyer
[3:05:19] naturesremedy: All his gems
[3:05:22] naturesremedy: are haste crit
[3:05:38] flawlesslykun: YEP

[4:05:11] burne114: are we hyped for the no healer keys being done in time trials?
[4:05:29] kelly_mac06: i feel like the nerfs were delayed bc of HOF
[4:05:47] kelly_mac06: if HOF filled faster (or had a lower cap) they would be nerfing faster
[4:05:50] burne114: I thought low to mid 20s was about standard for MDI? Or maybe im dumb
[4:06:00] ren0m: Is there any serious competition in MDI or is it like RWF?

[4:08:11] Patrikhg: i thnk only last boss but then u might play a bit more leechy specs
[4:08:50] burne114: i guess its true that for that trash, especially becuase it's tyran, they probably blow up those dragon pulls so fast

[4:43:59] cyn_x: j dote angel
[4:44:02] ritsrawr: idk... i been considering changing my spec... saw Growl doing it ez with tree.... he took Reforistation and just made sure he was on his 3rd every time she popped

[4:45:06] itsmagyks: the lizard dies tn
[4:45:20] ritsrawr: its like first one is Dr's and covoked... 2nd i pre hot pop all 3 trees, and third set is power pot and flourish, then im kinda tapped
[4:45:45] Darkelment: you should be able to alternate convoke and flourish
[4:45:52] Darkelment: since 1 of the set is 0 damage
[4:46:09] ritsrawr: yeah convoke should be back up after that 3rd im thinking
[4:46:19] ritsrawr: but like i said convoke rng be killing people sometimes
[4:46:38] Darkelment: ya i mean people have to pop defensives it does 1.5mill damage in 3 sec

[7:38:23] sgtshellshocka: im looking at the progress on warcraftlogs, thats probably why it isnt accurate
[7:38:27] sgtshellshocka: hmmm
[7:39:01] OrieleHS: warcraftlogs won't see kills that aren't logged and uploaded
[7:39:35] kelly_mac06: yea and the official HOF removes the booster "kills" that show in RIO
[7:39:41] kelly_mac06: so it's more reliable
[7:40:20] sgtshellshocka: good to know
