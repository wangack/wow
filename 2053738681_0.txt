[0:25:37] ionlyplaymetas: good showing out there today mes, i was hyped you got to play! hopefully unholy is buffed for the next cup!
[0:26:54] MaybeRespect: Still prefering claw build?

[0:27:00] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[0:28:09] michaelss_: my favourite part is they remove spell warding because it’s visible on details but rets dev aura that’s 3% is hidden so no one says a thing
[0:28:55] MaybeRespect: Nah bro they bout to buff DK to the moon!
[0:29:43] ionlyplaymetas: i wanted you guys to pop out with the ele/dh so bad
[0:29:44] michaelss_: but like spellwarding was 1.5% and people said they’re immmortal when it’s legit less than dev aura
[0:31:36] MaybeRespect: @michaelss_ Because if a class counters casters it's the end of the world bro
[0:32:12] MaybeRespect: haha i joke
[0:32:19] michaelss_: if dev aura and d stance showed on details people would scream for nerfs but cause dks stuff shows as healing it always gets nerfed because people are details gamers. I don’t even feel tanky against double caster anymore which was dk “niche”
[0:33:06] Peachxp_: Can i ask why defile? personally it feels awk
[0:34:48] michaelss_: lots of haste and mastery raw stats plus cleave & slow and it has a chance to put wound on the target which saves you festering globals also
[0:35:20] michaelss_: just put it down before you apoc, you’ll get used to it
[0:35:57] michaelss_: the haste you get from it actually gives you more globals than the one global you use to put it down in the long run
[0:48:40] Vigi9413: sorry it was 2nd place but you can get it back next week
[0:48:41] anmusallam: hello mesman how are you sir

[0:55:33] jacob_the_mage: mes my unholy DK feels squishy bro am I doing something wrong in pvp?
[0:55:39] IamWalnuts: the real question is where is the frost dk ww pres
[0:56:11] murloc_111: TBAG TBAG
[0:56:18] Vigi9413: how many cups are there for AWC
[0:56:24] Peachxp_: just 6-0'd a lobby with ur build felt pretty good actually the defile slow was noticable
[0:56:30] dankgamer97: have you guys seen any ww rogue comps ? looks busted KEKW
[0:56:46] Vigi9413: @murloc_111 you good bud?
[0:58:43] Peachxp_: is it a addon or a weakaura that replaces their name with the arena 123 number?
[0:58:55] IamWalnuts: they broke your shells insta jesus
[0:59:05] Vigi9413: I think it’s a script
[0:59:11] Vigi9413: or used to be
[1:00:22] sunileif: whats wrong with this murloc guy?
[1:00:25] kondal13: hey mes tough spot but good  games today man
[1:00:30] dankgamer97: @Peachxp_ might be betterblizzplates, think it have that feature
[1:00:44] crusadein: is the giga haste performing better than stacked mastery?
[1:00:48] sunileif: tbags of freindship
[1:00:56] sunileif: thats why klink always gets the bag
[1:01:11] sunileif: everyone wants to be klinks freind
[1:01:16] Vigi9413: did you get some run today I had to leave after game 2
[1:01:40] neko_young: you play defile every game?
[1:02:07] sunileif: i am curious as to how ww or even mm can hit so hard in arena and yet not raid
[1:02:27] sunileif: is just cause its built around tiny burst windows
[1:02:32] sunileif: and has no sustain
[1:04:47] Vigi9413: I notice it’s usually you/trill or sam/trill do you and sam have any comps you’ve played together?
[1:06:04] AxiomDK: Hey mes!
[1:06:27] Eradivyn: how squishy do you feel? is it feel horrible? @notmes

[1:36:55] trollmasta66: My lego wep is 14% of my damage for M+.... fury sucks
[1:37:53] ionlyplaymetas: will their wins get vacated if he is found to be botting?
[1:38:41] trollmasta66: Anyone else think some of the rogues were using sus macros in the AWC.
[1:41:29] trollmasta66: The cancel if (X), target if (x), ext.
[1:42:01] niuZIXIao: u cant do  that anymore
[1:42:09] trollmasta66: bunch of new macros that will make your character not do things unless something happens. Similar to the kick macro
[1:42:23] niuZIXIao: u meant scripting
[1:42:30] niuZIXIao: macros cant do that
[1:42:32] trollmasta66: There are still target macros
[1:42:36] trollmasta66: No it was a macro
[1:42:52] trollmasta66: it was being used for awhile until blizz started banning for it
[1:42:54] niuZIXIao: arent you talking about the present?
[1:43:01] niuZIXIao: ofc macros like that existed b4
[1:43:19] krome2dadome: sup lord mes
[1:43:30] trollmasta66: There were some sus targetting macros being used in live
[1:43:46] trollmasta66: mostly rogues and healers, I think Sam was using one on his Druid for a minute
[1:43:48] krome2dadome: enjoying the tsg experience?
[1:45:35] niuZIXIao: @trollmasta66 are you implyin the "wiz link kill"? It did look sus af but they did lose anyway.
[1:46:31] theodeth: cdew taking a giant shit on your comp
[1:46:31] trollmasta66: Well pika looked like his attacks were bugging out like hell, like he was using killing spree
[1:46:32] krome2dadome: there is 0% chance that wiz is cheating. should prob leave that convo there
[1:46:36] trollmasta66: but he was sub
[1:47:00] niuZIXIao: Pika never talented kill spree tho
[1:47:15] trollmasta66: Now that I think of you, you can prob make a DR stun macro, cancels cast if DR
[1:47:26] trollmasta66: @niuZIXIao I know, he was sub
[1:47:36] trollmasta66: I was using killing spree as an example of how it looked
[1:47:44] niuZIXIao: he was sub during which match?
[1:47:53] niuZIXIao: I think he was outlaw the entire series
[1:47:57] greatshampoo: he was outlaw every round
[1:48:15] trollmasta66: Diff day?
[1:48:16] niuZIXIao: the only sub rogue that played today was the EU champ Howton
[1:48:40] krome2dadome: u guys gotta kill any hpal u fight pretty sure @notmes
[1:49:44] krome2dadome: we never beat hpal teams w/o running them down and stun/arranging them on freedom
[1:49:55] krome2dadome: stranging*
[1:51:09] nikthevoker: we need a no name NA arc like EU
[1:52:12] iTarnish_: was sam the only one playing balance ?
[1:53:57] trollmasta66: @iTarnish_ think so
[1:54:07] trollmasta66: a lot of the same comps as last AWC
[1:58:05] krome2dadome: the classic tsg experience. losing on mana every game KEKW

[2:01:22] krome2dadome: the best we’ve done recently (into other rdruids) was w/ dot build, stopping every drink with epidemic, and just hitting closest
[2:08:27] wowsuomi: I need to watch back some of the games
[2:08:56] krome2dadome: we tried that last one a bit I think. can hit some like 200k+ reaping clawings
[2:09:06] krome2dadome: but yea idk much abt dk
[2:10:07] krome2dadome: just feels like tsg really lacks kill potential after dk nerfs
[2:10:16] krome2dadome: and hp buffs
[2:10:34] gremell: u got haste?
[2:10:43] krome2dadome: like our only win condition in a lot of games is max pveing
[2:10:46] neko_young: when was the last expansion that TSG is actually good?
[2:11:10] krome2dadome: it was good at the start of this season
[2:11:33] neko_young: i mean it is a zug zug comp

[3:23:02] shamebadge: 3000/4000 NVIDIA NVENC generations are actually pretty good.. it's the 1000/2000 cards that suck for video encoding

[3:23:59] eMBeaR64oz: I’m still curious about those deaths on link totems

[3:25:19] shamebadge: @artsskeit hell yea it is.. I would -never- use an AMD CPU for gaming
[3:25:35] shamebadge: always stick Intel for gaming, and NVIDIA graphics cards
[3:26:16] artsskeit: love - my 7800x3d
[3:26:48] artsskeit: nah get fucked
[3:27:51] Aprost0_0: Is there some guide to his interface D:
[3:27:52] shamebadge: 7800 is an ok cpu, but not the best for gaming. AMD excel better at business multitasking
[3:29:25] Ratkingdomdh: @shamebadge shut ur amd shaming mouth
[3:30:03] shamebadge: @Ratkingdomdh You're about to get Aldi's

[3:36:04] shamebadge: sure, let me send you some examples to use
[3:36:24] shamebadge: Streamlabs or OBS?
[3:37:03] eMBeaR64oz: that sounds all good, and I’m also not seeing blurry frames so
[3:37:17] eMBeaR64oz: or artifactinf
[3:37:23] eMBeaR64oz: nah
[3:37:34] avenueone: hes watching on 43"
[3:37:40] eMBeaR64oz: looked on phone and on tv and was watching on pc earlier it seems fine
[3:37:50] shamebadge: mixture of the eye and I have a larger monitor which amplifies defects :P
[3:38:35] eMBeaR64oz: I mean my tv is 65, my monitor is 27, gaming main monitor 24 and then phone and not getting it on anything
[3:38:47] eMBeaR64oz: tv 60.hz monitors 144
[3:39:52] eMBeaR64oz: might wanna check your monitor for overscan or some monitors have a ghosting effect if you push to 165hz or more depending on brand and quality
[3:40:56] shamebadge: @eMBeaR64oz I am an industry leader in broadcasting and multimedia streaming. I have an eye for defects in video encoding
[3:41:17] shamebadge: generally when I introduce myself I get flamed by 12 year olds on Twitch, so I tend not to :)
[3:41:59] shamebadge: @notmes check if your settings are different/lower than what I sent you. your screen might look different than mine depending if you are in simple or advanced mode. 2 pass is worth it yes
[3:42:03] al_capow: it looks pretty solid to me
[3:42:04] eMBeaR64oz: I do this for a living too I’m just not sure what your seeing lol
[3:42:13] shamebadge: you can use high quality and not low latency
[3:42:27] eMBeaR64oz: I’m not 12 year old@just letting you know what I’ve observed people do
[3:42:35] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[3:43:00] shamebadge: low latency is more used for live  streaming to reduce glass to glass delays
[3:43:30] shamebadge: you sacrifice a very small % of quality for speed. either is acceptable though you're not aiming for ultra low latency

[3:45:43] eMBeaR64oz: nice, yeah I enjoy the nvenc codecs for sure
[3:45:52] bubblefeet_: what’s your job title
[3:46:46] shamebadge: I own all my companies @bubblefeet_
[3:47:35] ImHomegr0wn: monkaW
[3:48:18] eMBeaR64oz: most my job is video editing and algorithm guessing, but used obs now exclusively since do g full time yt like 8ish years ago, and I have an obsessive personality so went DEEP on obs as well as video/audio min maxing lol
[3:48:32] eMBeaR64oz: going *
[3:48:56] bubblefeet_: how does one work directly with engineers from competing companies
[3:49:44] shamebadge: @bubblefeet_ I have contracts with both. I use technology from both of them
[3:49:54] TheBackstabi: I mean it's not that far fetched. MSI and ASUS make AMD and Nvidia cards
[3:50:01] eMBeaR64oz: professional spy
[3:50:16] shamebadge: some of their technology is competing and some of it is complimentary
[3:50:20] eMBeaR64oz: or just one of the many third party companies that deal with them lol
[3:51:31] TeamLiquid: Looking to take your gameplay to the next level? Learning a new class and would like some pointers? Head on over to our discord go.adv.gg/S0oICP to schedule a coaching session with your favorite Team Liquid raider!
[3:52:49] eMBeaR64oz: that’s be cool if there was a third big consumer grade company that could drive competition
[3:53:10] bubblefeet_: not an easy business to get into
[3:53:14] shamebadge: their enterprise technology helps drive the consumer grade a lot
[3:53:22] TheBackstabi: The Intel cards definitely messed with low/entry level
[3:53:26] bubblefeet_: talking about iterations on the same product over decades
[3:53:30] TheBackstabi: It's just going to take an eternity for them to build up
[3:53:54] bubblefeet_: yeah but intel is a well established computer hardware giant
[3:54:04] shamebadge: I have never used Intel's new Arc graphics cards, but I've seen a lot of great reviews on them for the low end market at a great price
[3:54:44] shamebadge: I think they would be a good potential to look into for a budget alternative to NVIDIA. especially for encoding/decoding their quality performance is pretty good for the cost
[3:55:28] bubblefeet_: what sort of engagement do you get viewer wise shame?
[3:55:32] TheBackstabi: The nature of GPUs today means the only companies capable of entering are established giants. I see no way a brand new company could gain enough VC interest to actually enter it
[3:55:37] shamebadge: NVIDIA knows they have the best right now and they charge a premium for it. you pay for the name, but you know you're getting quality software, drivers, hardware.. it's a good package
[3:55:43] shamebadge: @bubblefeet_ what do you mean?
[3:56:13] bubblefeet_: mm not to mention the price standard set during mining craze
[3:56:32] bubblefeet_: prices skyrocketed, nvidia saw avg consumer was willing to buy anyways, kept the price there
[3:57:37] TheBackstabi: When I saw a report that high-priced, low-yield products outperformed low-price, high-yield I was very surprised
[3:57:50] TheBackstabi: Not sure on the accuracy of that or where I saw it, so could've been bait
[3:58:01] shamebadge: companies are still price gouging. to make things worse solid state storage and memory prices are going up a good 30-50% further
[3:59:53] avenueone: tate: Your interesting pagan brick lord Mez!
[4:00:47] mattehlol: AMD have said it's not currently in their scope to make the best of the best
[4:01:06] mattehlol: better to focus on making something that gets close with good value
[4:01:20] TheBackstabi: Yeah it was something along the lines of "We could make a 4090 competitor by throwing more power into it, but it doesn't make sense"
[4:01:46] overrrlord12: yoo grats
[4:01:56] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[4:02:13] TheBackstabi: Which when you consider the 4090 as mostly a working card, AMD lacks all the software benefits that people would buy the 4090 for, so understandable to not waste $ on making that kind of hardware
[4:02:52] TheBackstabi: But that loops back around to why doesn't AMD develop their productivity software
[4:04:27] shamebadge: NVIDIA for a long time has been a software company first, and pivoted a lot of their efforts into AI lately
[4:04:27] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[4:05:01] TheBackstabi: How did none of those kill
[4:05:06] shamebadge: their enterprise L40/L40S A100 H100/H200 are making them incredible sales
[4:05:21] hinalloo: @notmes how u tracking fire shock on a1, a2, a3?
[4:05:27] shamebadge: these cards share some DNA with the consumer grade graphics cards
[4:06:09] shamebadge: AMD hasn't been doing a good job in competing with the high end consumer grade graphics cards, so they started to focus more on the low/mid markets
[4:07:18] shamebadge: for gaming Intel would be a better choice IMO
[4:07:42] TheBackstabi: Aren't the L cards basically 4090's repackaged? Or at least a similar base
[4:07:47] shamebadge: from all testing I've done I've gotten more consistent results from Intel CPUs for gaming, Intel CPUs for AI, and AMD CPUs for general workstation/server workloads
[4:08:24] shamebadge: @TheBackstabi very similar DNA to the 4090, passively cooled with double the ram. that's the easiest way to think of them
[4:08:48] shamebadge: L40 is a CUDA capped version, L40S is unlocked. both have the same NVENC/NVDEC performance
[4:10:04] shamebadge: same architecture though, yea
[4:11:59] TheBackstabi: I'm curious how/what you tested for Intel/AMD CPU gaming performance. Everything I've seen has favored the 7000X3D chips against their price-equivalent Intel ones
[4:12:50] shamebadge: I generally only deal with higher end SKUs for sampling @TheBackstabi
[4:13:08] TheBackstabi: Yeah I'm talking about the entire stack
[4:13:12] KorialstraszTV: The real question is if you are stricktly playing wow and streaming is AMD mid range actually the way to go when it comes to performance vs price
[4:13:28] shamebadge: the last consumer CPUs ones I tested were 13900K and 7950X
[4:14:06] shamebadge: for the 3D AMD variants I've only tested their EPYC CPUs, which I did not benchmark for gaming :)
[4:14:31] TheBackstabi: Ah, yeah that'd impact your view then
[4:14:41] TheBackstabi: If you get a chance, take a look at the newer X3Ds
[4:14:54] TheBackstabi: With only a small handful of exceptions, they blow Intel out hard
[4:16:53] shamebadge: I'll check it out.  One thing to keep in mind the only difference is the V cache and it's hit or miss (no pun intended)
[4:18:17] imabeast001: bro my game keeps getting “instance not found” and I tried everything. I’m pretty sure it’s my addons causing it but I updated them. 😥
[4:20:49] shamebadge: @imabeast001 an easy option is to turn them all off and see if it works. I've never seen an addon impact instance not found, but hey wow is buggy as hell. stranger things could happen
[4:20:53] TheBackstabi: I'd have to look into the specifics, but I believe the 7800X3D specifically has a layout that makes that VCache change very, -very- good (I believe it's 1CCD). Depending on what the 7900/7950 does in a given game, the 7800 can outperform lol
[4:22:13] shamebadge: oh no doubt the V cache is incredibly fast. you have to consider worst case scenario if it isn't hitting the V cache variants are usually a -hair- slower than the non V cache SKUs (not enough that it should matter)
[4:22:36] shamebadge: I think the Intels get pretty consistent performance vs the ups and downs you might get with AMD (projecting here based on past experience)
[4:24:31] shamebadge: also another thing to keep in mind, if you're comparing the upper end 7950 with 3d , compare it against a similar 14900k from Intel. I'd probably put my $ on the 14900k it -should- in more instances than not consistently be faster

[4:28:23] ryanbigdaggers: No kap
[4:29:25] i11danzo: thoughts about yesterday? @notmes
[4:31:14] TheBackstabi: @shamebadge Yeah it can vary depending on game. i.e it looks like FF14 and Siege favors Intel frequency, while other titles the 7800 in particular will beat 14900k (7900X3d/7950X3d vary more from CCD shenanigans)
[4:31:20] Cuhrismuh: Stream quiet tonight
[4:31:28] TheBackstabi: 7800X3d*
[4:32:22] shamebadge: depending on how the game engines are built and tuned they might favor higher core count, or higher core frequency
[4:32:34] shamebadge: every game will respond differently
[4:32:38] Cuhrismuh: Your team did well at least
[4:32:46] artsskeit: does the 7950x3d vary?  i thought it was functionally a 7800x3d + 8 additional cores without the vcache so same gaming performance with additional productivity
[4:33:00] shamebadge: @notmes that change you made in OBS did make an improvement
[4:33:25] shamebadge: in the few arena games I saw
[4:33:55] shamebadge: yea yea
[4:34:14] TheBackstabi: @artsskeit That's the problem - one CCD has the enhanced vcache, the other doesn't. So if the game, windows, or AMD software starts being dumb, it'll start flipping between the two, increasing frame times
[4:36:24] TheBackstabi: You can manually control that, but it's a game-by-game config so can be time consuming to set. Generally the advice I've seen is for purely gaming, prefer the 7800X3d
[4:36:37] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[4:36:39] shamebadge: What output is low mes?
[4:36:49] shamebadge: your audio?
[4:38:11] shamebadge: ehh.. the bitrate cap Twitch has kind of makes it on the low/mid range for 1440p
[4:38:32] shamebadge: Twitch kind of built themselves around 1080p
[4:38:37] shamebadge: that's my point

[4:45:33] shamebadge: the ABR ladder settings Twitch uses is low, you are correct yes.
[4:46:14] shamebadge: it's basically "here is the origin stream resolution and bitrate, and anything below it in the ladder is using gimped settings". they do it to reduce the transcoding load
[4:46:21] shamebadge: increase density
[4:46:55] shamebadge: storage is expensive yes :)
[4:47:01] Skyzehlol: indeed
[4:47:14] cdewx: 968 raiders from cdewx have joined! 
[4:47:14] StreamElements: cdewx just raided the channel with 968 viewers PogChamp
[4:47:17] shamebadge: on average streamers use hundreds of GB of storage of videos on my servers

[4:47:34] cdewx: cdewx subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 81 months! ez
[4:47:41] shamebadge: I don't think streamers realize how much storage their videos take
[4:48:42] shamebadge: wait until 4khd becomes mainstream
[4:48:49] MrChillGates: streaming video is expensive
[4:48:52] MrChillGates: server wise
[4:48:55] TheBackstabi: PirateSoftware made a very funny short about Twitch's money issue https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_sNcbXj5A0
[4:49:27] MrChillGates: yessirrr
[4:50:00] shamebadge: so - Twitch has many pre-recorded videos broadcasting which are low earners for them, also they were in bidding wars with Google and Facebook with exclusive/non-exclusive contracts in the past. they are not entering bidding wards anymore, but the damage was already done
[4:50:17] shamebadge: it does not cost twitch $4,360
[4:50:22] shamebadge: that's a lie :P
[4:50:37] shamebadge: notmes, those #'s are not accurate
[4:50:51] TheBackstabi: Yeah definitely an over-estimation as Twitch as a company (and being tied to Amazon) has lower rates
[4:50:53] MrChillGates: they own the severs
[4:51:09] MrChillGates: but they could still allocate them to smething else
[4:51:22] hotpocket2077: if 1000 people randomly host a stream in 1 day, that's 1mil gone god damn
[4:51:32] shamebadge: let's assume 8000 viewers at 8mbps, that's 64gbps for 8 hours (assuming also none of those get kicked down in ABR)
[4:52:04] shamebadge: this guy is quoting retail prices, not wholesale prices
[4:52:39] TheBackstabi: But it's a great visualizer of just how much it -could- take to operate such a thing. Even if you cut the prices by 90%, that's a fuckton across every streamer
[4:52:51] shamebadge: so the reality is, people don't want to pay to be able to stream
[4:52:58] AntTheRogue: bro i just got +0 rating for a 4-2 in shuffle on a fresh rdruid alt at 1700 lol how
[4:53:09] reavethederp: that guys good, but this sounds ridiculous
[4:53:24] shamebadge: people don't want to pay for access to social media networks. if they did it would make it easier to monetize the networks reliably versus going to advertising revenue and selling your data instead
[4:54:02] Kronstharor: Ee
[4:54:19] reavethederp: intresting
[4:54:25] MrChillGates: the storage isnt the expensive part imo
[4:54:33] MrChillGates: the streaming is very
[4:54:34] shamebadge: you're being transcoded 5x :P 720p 60fps, 720p 30fps, 480p, 360p, 160p
[4:54:39] Colaja953: borpaSpin
[4:55:08] shamebadge: @MrChillGates the storage is expensive
[4:55:16] MrChillGates: if they were smart they would make is p2p
[4:55:18] xdtai: i used to watch streams on 160p in the background when my internet was horrible, i would have it as background noise
[4:55:32] MrChillGates: @shamebadge i am saying compared to the streaming aspect
[4:55:37] gracioussatan: maybe they'll introduce a barrier to entry for streaming
[4:55:54] blightclub: It is really interesting how many tech companies operate at a loss. As someone graduating this year with a CS degree - the job market is rough because interest rates are limiting the amount of VC money floating around to these companies
[4:56:00] shamebadge: they won't make you pay for streaming because the consumers wouldn't pay for it
[4:56:28] shamebadge: it's like in the USA people are used to "Free refills", and the rest of the world is used to paying for refills
[4:56:31] MrChillGates: p2p id peer to peer and that would involve everyone collectively sharing their bandwidth to watch the stream
[4:56:41] shamebadge: you have consumers conditioned to certain expectations and they are hard to give them up
[4:57:54] shamebadge: 8khd streaming isn't even going to be touched for at least 5+ years or more
[4:58:07] shamebadge: I've done 8khd streaming at 150mbps in my lab
[4:58:07] MrChillGates: no i am saying that people could use a peer to peer setup to help the streamer stream. it would be like a torrent
[4:58:29] shamebadge: 4khd you can do pretty nice with 25-40mbps
[4:58:59] indithedog: i heard about that
[4:59:02] shamebadge: network infrastructures are not ready for 8khd live streaming. not yet
[4:59:10] indithedog: cool for IRL streams
[4:59:32] GlobalWarming: casey neistat said after a couple hours he forgot he was wearing it
[4:59:35] Allomaternal: i saw someone watching a basketball game with it, looked pretty solid
[4:59:39] shamebadge: we're still upgrading servers from 100gbps to 400gbps network adapters on servers in production
[5:00:00] eMBeaR64oz: I think it will@also need to be smaller sized, like goggles or glasses without a wire
[5:00:06] al_capow: can you image playing first person wow in it
[5:00:10] shamebadge: we're going to need servers with multi tbps network adapters before you can even think of doing 8khd live streaming in scale
[5:00:11] al_capow: all those procs
[5:00:12] Allomaternal: definitely smaller size yeah
[5:01:13] 7ifetime: this is the 'pro' so theyll probably release a normal one
[5:01:15] eMBeaR64oz: they want it to be usable in public, which atm with people that have used it irl looks dystopian af
[5:01:20] shamebadge: the first one always pays the innovator tax
[5:01:33] al_capow: Xreal exists in the form your thinking of, but it's just as AR glasses
[5:01:38] al_capow: but those are the best reviewed atm
[5:01:45] eMBeaR64oz: the tech is gonna be insane tho, and it’ll only get better
[5:01:45] al_capow: you're*
[5:01:58] shamebadge: iphones priced their products extremely low when they first came out because they were investing in spreading the OS not the hardware
[5:02:18] 7ifetime: apple watch, maybe
[5:02:19] shamebadge: iphone made their money from the appstore, not the iphone hardware
[5:02:19] Allomaternal: its a product that kind of shows what's to come
[5:02:34] GlobalWarming: when its the size of regular glasses thats when itll be widespread
[5:02:36] xdtai: apple watch didnt WOW you
[5:02:47] eMBeaR64oz: think about game streaming with it and for me personally possibly editing
[5:03:06] shamebadge: most people went from flip phones to an iphone. it was a game changer having a full OS in your phone
[5:03:18] al_capow: mes check out https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-air-2-pro
[5:03:24] MrChillGates: honestly amazon probably uses twitch to lose money and write it off as a loss and 2x the value because it is costing them money in server space and actual money
[5:03:26] al_capow: and some of the vids
[5:03:30] shamebadge: but through the iterations the technology in iphone slowed down and they went for safe vs innovative bleeding edge
[5:03:43] eMBeaR64oz: there’s also tech atm I saw where someone would THINK about something and it would type it out, so imagine in like 15 yea when you can think about something and the vision pro does it instead of needing hand gestures
[5:04:00] eMBeaR64oz: years*
[5:04:02] al_capow: also forgot to mention it earlier but awesome tourney today <3
[5:04:23] al_capow: yeah AR glasses
[5:04:56] lasergazer3: What about the new Musk brain microchip?
[5:05:06] al_capow: they miss the interactive component vision pro have, e.g. hand gestures
