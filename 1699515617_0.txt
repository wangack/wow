[0:41:08] EzShotPR: can you make hhtd maker smaller ?
[0:41:44] Varcolac_: Frostydk has an awesome looking ability breath of syndrogosa but it does so little damage that is not even worth it. but that talent actually adds like something to think about when you're playing Frost at night instead of obliterate howling blast obliterate frostrike obliterate frostrike obliterate howling blast....

[1:27:04] 7fpv: They also need to not show the number of players ready when que pops. because higher level people can go on stream and win trade with friends by making sure they both see the same number ready
