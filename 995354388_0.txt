[2:18:33] ElPolloBatman: get metzen to sign it

[2:18:47] Knocx: its DnD 5th E
[2:18:51] KaisenSiru: Catan is very good
[2:19:02] Wildside1177: Pandemic is an amazing tabletop game.
[2:19:07] ElPolloBatman: settlers is technically a boardgame and the metzen thing is a sourcebook for a pen and paper campaign
[2:19:10] Wildside1177: No joke
[2:19:26] Kinshar: What do you think about the serious gaming change?
[2:19:32] xALcaPWNedx: week 2 of healing from my bone graft. this sucks lol
[2:19:40] Knocx: its a sourcebook for DnD 5th E
[2:19:41] PokerFaceMoose: its an additional source book to dungeons and dragon 5e.
[2:19:42] grimblymcgoo: so its basically a campaign book?
[2:19:53] magemaster225: yeah he basically wants to put out a rulebook/campaign for people to follow
[2:19:55] PokerFaceMoose: and new rules
[2:19:56] Sarocus: lol, the kickstarter is at 571k out of the 50k goal
[2:20:02] LoremasterMarthan: It's a DnD source book - so a different campaign of sorts for the purposes of playing DnD
[2:20:09] smashwow: think they meant serious gaming as in Allen and Vic
[2:20:10] BlueBlurPrime: still need ash to get to rank 5, then 6&7 need an item
[2:20:29] HumusGG: You still need Soul Ash at least to make a rank 4 if you want a different legendary
[2:20:34] Alchin0: itd be nice if they switched soul ash to upgrade conduits
[2:20:50] ElPolloBatman: @Towelliee if you wanna give boardgames a try you should check out gloomhaven - jaws of the lion. or 7 wonders if you're more into cards or pandemic: legacy if you want legacy game (play through it once with changes applying to rules, board and cards)
[2:20:58] Korupcija_: fuck blizzard! PogChamp

[2:21:56] Madnezz123: wow is gonna hit wod subs numbers till 9.1 comes out
[2:22:06] brewsephtv: Soul ash not having a catchup is the main reason I haven't had any motivation to prep my prot pally because I still have like 3 legendaries I still need to craft
[2:22:31] Fluaxx: What about WoD final patch?
[2:22:32] LoremasterMarthan: Does that count HFC -> Legion?
[2:22:36] fistofnature: Torgast PogChamp
[2:22:40] falldrgn: Hell I just don;t want to do M+ to gear up again to catch up for 9.1 is valor useless for me then?

[2:25:51] etter00: lol gold from meat 🍖
[2:25:57] DeanoTV: new expansion should bring new class yea
[2:25:57] HAMMERRAZOR: the covnenant callings, the profession gathering bags and the rest, just give you alot of gold selling that stuff

[2:26:50] Brandonhipster: will void lords be in the next one?

[2:27:24] BRUTALIT0PS: 10.0 I am sure they will try to make it big, but we'll see what happens
[2:27:25] LoremasterMarthan: Feels like a hot take, but i really dont think we need any more races/classes for at least 1 or 2 more expansions after Shadowlands
[2:27:26] rimonabant: people already looking towards the next expansion.. we're just chasing the dragon at this point
[2:27:31] ElPolloBatman: it's time to bring out the big guns, the next wow expansion will allow you to romance npcs

[2:28:06] theorodrem5: ppl loved fresh classic
[2:28:07] fistofnature: Wow2 Pog
[2:28:08] Brandonhipster: i would be down for that
[2:28:10] raldrik: yeah that would kill wow.
[2:28:15] Brandonhipster: start fresh with a updated WoW
[2:28:18] ElPolloBatman: how about wow with the looks of overwatch?
[2:28:21] Sarocus: They could do like Everquest and let us port our characters to WoW2
[2:28:25] Sollice: Why not? WoW could have a story end. Time skip ( forwards OR backwards ) and come out with a new engine and new game
[2:28:32] MrEvilRex: here is my pitch: to Azeroth is dying and to avoid the Jailor/Void lords etc.. Azeroth fuses their souul with all the players allowing them to use 2 specs at the same time...
[2:28:40] duffluv22: I'll be down for it. It needs something new!!!
[2:28:40] jasonx282: world of starcraft? something like nomans sky
[2:28:42] Valestrus: @Towelliee do you think youll be able to carry one of our WoW toons into WoW 2.0?
[2:28:44] Funderik: idk why people get the idea wow 2 would be better, it's the same devs lol they only upgrade would be graphics
[2:28:46] swinkeh: update azeroth to the present day a time after we completed all those quests
[2:28:49] spekktrum19: i can see the void lords coming, illidan and the titans, including sargeras, coming back etc. for 10.0
[2:28:50] McGreeb: wow 2? thet are rereleasing it soon, your streaming wow 9
[2:29:01] Quimby54: yeah nah that's a terrible idea, especially if they scrap 17 years of effort
[2:29:07] Shockey187: yeah... I spent way too many degenerate for a complete restart
[2:29:14] Shockey187: hours*
[2:29:34] swordwindgaming: MMORPG sequels as an idea is so dead
[2:29:42] Arocian: yeah, many won't give up all the years of time and collection
[2:29:43] cptrogers123: could finally be nice if they took a risk man
[2:29:45] king_julian_96: Maybe they will have a option to copy your character from wow 1 to wow 2 so you don’t lose that 17 year progress you did
[2:29:47] pixxelina: yup
[2:29:47] ElPolloBatman: world of diablocraft, i'm calling it! and the first expansion will be deckard cain: black ops
[2:29:47] swordwindgaming: the trend is to take existing MMORPG franchises mobile, and the people want it
[2:29:52] duffluv22: Problem will be supply and demand. You need the availability of the stuff needed. Hell I still can get a new graphics card!!!!
[2:29:54] Shrandamar: They wont do WoW2, they are more likely to do some kind of revamp of the game in big expansion
[2:29:55] MattyjTV: i could see them doing a wow 2 with an option to import things from current wow like achive and mogs i wouldnt be the worst
[2:30:01] smashwow: gotta keep bobby employed Kappa
[2:30:16] grimblymcgoo: wow and their mobile games on king
[2:30:23] KingSlayerYotam: diablo 2 will be good
[2:30:24] ElPolloBatman: i assume hearthstone is a big deal due to revenue
[2:30:29] Brandonhipster: There like World of warcraft immortal
[2:30:33] swordwindgaming: WoW Mobile is going to be forever. You know its coming.
[2:30:34] Valestrus: @Towelliee do you think youll be able to carry one of our WoW 1.0 toons into WoW 2.0? (IF IT HAPPENS)
[2:30:42] Sollice: I don't think Hearthstone brings in the money as much anymore
[2:30:52] scenario17: @smashwow keep Bobby afloat, on that yacht lol
[2:30:53] Unciatim: Good reason for the aged brain trust to leave... we want to make a new game... ActiOverlords.. NOOOOOOOO.. Milk WoW and make mobile games.. cause ya know, yhou all have cell phones right????
[2:30:58] Bullviine: @Towelliee - Do you think WoW needs a new engine?
[2:30:59] brian_777777777: like fable 3
[2:31:00] Brandonhipster: idk those unreal 4 video of WoW from that guy was good
[2:31:02] capncolbeer: draw distance
[2:31:05] buffn99: RTX on
[2:31:06] capncolbeer: higher-rez models
[2:31:08] Xailen: I bet they would scuff a new engine, kill the game possibly
[2:31:08] KaisenSiru: Never going to happen
[2:31:09] MistaHat: If you can see the fur lol
[2:31:11] Bullviine: New Engine, new problems
[2:31:12] magemaster225: they put on a cel-shaded/anime filter, genshin impact style
[2:31:19] duffluv22: Wow in unreal???!!! Hell yes!!!!
[2:31:21] capncolbeer: more polygons, smoother corners
[2:31:21] LeonardLongNips: higher res and better shadow/lighting
[2:31:23] beckett3a: wow has always been known as a game you could run on a toaster
[2:31:23] Kromede: mutant bear Kappa
[2:31:26] robertjordan83: @Towelliee people freaked out over the new character models, its not going to be very different visually
[2:31:28] swordwindgaming: A new WoW would look stylistically the same, but the engine would be a lot easier to work with. The WC3 engine is getting on in years.
[2:31:31] thiccsushi: A new engine for better cpu optimization maybe
[2:31:38] grimblymcgoo: higher res just makes people have to upgrade their computers
[2:31:38] LoremasterMarthan: There is a level of "uncanny valley" to video games with animation/quality - if you hit a super realistic level, alot of the animations will end up looking downright creepy in its current style
[2:31:51] Sollice: It wont be in UE4 or any UE at this point. They dont want to pay a competitor those royalities
[2:31:55] Shrandamar: yeah they are working on a new engine, it's cross-platform too so that could finally see wow move to console or mobile :P
[2:31:58] capncolbeer: better engine could aqueeze more performance out of newer CPU's
[2:31:58] McGreeb: The engine stuff can all be done without calling it WoW 2
[2:32:05] Valestrus: @Towelliee do you think youll be able to carry one of our WoW 1.0 toons into WoW 2.0? (IF IT HAPPENS)
[2:32:10] Baldarsar: @Towelliee  i think WoW looks good as it is, nothing needs to be changed only fine tuned. it got his own style .
[2:32:16] S3RialDust: What we need is not wow 2.0, it's world of starcraft

[2:32:30] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[2:32:35] Bullviine: Rather they announce a new MMO, Universe of Starcraft
[2:32:37] Tyrsfal: Sup! Big shame about jeff :(
[2:32:48] Sollice: @Bullvine_007 Agree
[2:32:55] Baldarsar: @Towelliee i think WoW looks good as it is, nothing needs to be changed only fine tuned. it got his own style
[2:33:02] Brandonhipster: yeah i miss starcraft universe
[2:33:05] reyvin40: they should do some new skins for druids.  Maybe a gorilla guardian skin.
[2:33:06] OmgItsEdizzle: Whatever it is, it needs to keep Towelliee playing so I have something entertaining to watch at work REEEEEEEEEEEEE
[2:33:08] Brandonhipster: sucks SC2 pretty much dead
[2:33:12] Brandonhipster: from support really
[2:33:15] Shrandamar: I think their main reason for wanting a new engine is to make it easier to make content faster
[2:33:27] capncolbeer: could be porting OW engine stuff over for better latency....PVP
[2:33:30] scartotem: tbh i probably wouldnt play a wow2 if it changed the game too much. not interested in learning a whole new game
[2:33:38] Brandonhipster: LUL
[2:33:38] Sollice: @ShrandaTV How can a new engine help get content out quicker? They have 17 years of experience in this engine
[2:33:39] Thoreya: go go go lol
[2:33:40] Thoreya: go back in
[2:33:40] stijn0416: OOF

[2:33:46] Frank4LuLz: bannerd
[2:33:47] Bullviine: AFter seeing Ashes video and engine and New World Videos, let them leave the engine alone. These new MMos look garbo compared to WoW
[2:33:48] swordwindgaming: F
[2:33:50] Frank4LuLz: banned
[2:33:50] stijn0416: LUL
[2:33:51] McGreeb: RIP
[2:33:53] capncolbeer: old engine
[2:33:53] HumusGG: F
[2:33:56] manmower: 10.0 is a perfect time to revamp the old world
[2:33:56] swordwindgaming: Theres your reason for a new engine right there.
[2:33:57] Bulgogiprince: Artistically if it's the same, but refined fixes on clipping and other display errors with a new engine would be great
[2:34:02] Thoreya: literally lmao
[2:34:03] king_julian_96: Lol
[2:34:08] pavepawns: what just happened?
[2:34:10] denflup: u have faith in 9.1?
[2:34:15] KaisenSiru: Yeah WoW is fine as it is. Honestly, I think it just needs more variety of skeleton rigs. While the reskins look good, you can't unseen what the skeletons usually are
[2:34:19] Frank4LuLz: rip
[2:34:29] tposingsnorlax: D:
[2:34:32] Sollice: Torghast n00b
[2:34:39] LoremasterMarthan: RIP Hardcore run
[2:34:46] HumusGG: at least the instance did not reset
[2:34:53] mizerboy: Is 9.1 going to save this Xpac?
[2:35:01] Brandonhipster: i dont think so
[2:35:15] grimblymcgoo: @mizerboy probably not.
[2:35:25] McGreeb: I hear something about being able to level in torghast in 9.1?
[2:35:27] swordart_19: @mizerboy lol what to save? I game is good you play it or not.
[2:35:45] DeanoTV: the expac doesn't need saved, people just need to stop being lazy and do the actual content
[2:35:46] Thewunk: Thewunk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:35:53] grimblymcgoo: @McGreeb some datamining indicates they may be adding experience to torghast. nothing positive yet though
[2:36:07] grimblymcgoo: @DeanoTV lol? we've all done the content for months
[2:36:09] Valestrus: @Towelliee do you think youll be able to carry one of our WoW 1.0 toons into WoW 2.0? (IF IT HAPPENS)
[2:36:14] Fluaxx: Experience to torghast but you can only do it at max level?
[2:36:14] duffluv22: I think the only thing that is keeping wow interesting is trying to see what will happen to its characters.
[2:36:16] McGreeb: @Grimblymcgoo goot way to get Twisting Coridoors done
[2:36:49] DeanoTV: @Grimblymcgoo the new patch will bring new content and no1 will do it and complain theres nothing to do
[2:37:00] tposingsnorlax: Cata 2.0
[2:37:19] grimblymcgoo: @DeanoTV you're not making sense. people will play the new zone, the mega dungeon, and the raid.
[2:37:19] MrGhostlore: It's somewhat concerning that so many people are jumping ship
[2:37:20] swinkeh: update azeroth to the present day a time after we completed all those quests
[2:37:20] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:37:21] mizerboy: Not complaining there is nothing to do. This xpac for me has been underwhelming
[2:37:27] Shrandamar: what if time reversed and the continents got united again? :P
[2:37:28] Mitune: I mean they have the whole cosmos to work with so it is possible to just be on a completely different planet
[2:37:30] Thoreya: id like to see more systemic changes than like a graphic revamp
[2:37:32] Frank4LuLz: Cataclysm - Refoged
[2:37:41] smashwow: she'll crack that egg iirc
[2:37:44] captiv8: captiv8 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[2:37:59] manmower: azeroth will split in half, so we can have space battles horde v alliance in BFA2
[2:38:02] Brandonhipster: @Grimblymcgoo I guess 1 raid and lots of people already at top gear means we are lazy. :P
[2:38:03] PadidinJones: Azeroth will pop out like the aliens in Alien movies
[2:38:13] Sincline387: wow 2.0 is going to be an expansion with an upgraded engine not a true "new" game.  Everquest 2 proved that a model that cuts off character continuity is doomed to fail
[2:38:13] Templexx: how about the other side of azeroth
[2:38:18] PokerFaceMoose: i want a time jump so we can drop a bunch of these characters that have lingered too long.
[2:38:24] spekktrum19: haven't they talked about time moving differently in SL? i think they will play up that idea when/if we go back to Azeroth
[2:38:26] xrandomdoodx: warforged LUL
[2:38:26] Calphurnious: I'd wait like 10 years at least so they really wait for gpus to progress before a revamp
[2:38:31] common_taco: Azeroth will wake up and kill us all with the sword and say, thanks for nothing
[2:38:33] reyvin40: Azeroth is flat
[2:38:36] LoremasterMarthan: Azeroth is flat confirmed
[2:38:36] UlyssesPaxton: Wow re-crafted
[2:38:43] PokerFaceMoose: i think the map we see is the whole thing.
[2:38:44] Templexx: bunch kalimdor flat earthers
[2:38:48] MrEvilRex: flat azeroth confirmed
[2:38:51] PokerFaceMoose: its just a globe flattened out
[2:38:52] Xerevil: Azeroth is flat confirmed...LOL
[2:38:59] ryte1676: there are more sides to aezeroth as long as the sub money keeps rolling in
[2:39:04] smashwow: flazeroth Kappa
[2:39:06] MrGhostlore: Flat Azeroth Society
[2:39:09] Kinshar: World of Warcraft: Now with new devs
[2:39:18] McGreeb: Flat Azeroth confirmed, Towelliee said so
[2:39:24] PidiaP: PidiaP subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Here’s to help with the homelessness Kappa
[2:39:40] duffluv22: Azeroth wakes up and fixes everything back to pre cata. Wow New World
[2:39:42] j_bar111: I love when they do remakes and let you toggle on the old graphics, like they did in halo too
[2:39:46] Gorblade_69: Personally i don't think we need more places to go to. There's plenty of space already that can be used for things in the future.
[2:40:06] duffluv22: Introducing new engine
[2:40:11] SilverAlix: De other other side
[2:40:41] odysseus1: There's so much classic space that could be used for 10.0 though. Some reverse Cataclysm where things are rebuilt across the world
[2:40:48] Mitune: hopefully 10.0 has less systems or no special weird systems
[2:40:49] bobmcfob: If you were to get your own gfuel flavor what would you do
[2:40:53] sepehr_akhavans: why don't you go invis and just kill bosses?
[2:40:57] Brandonhipster: Ion not the only one working on this game...WHAT

[2:41:28] Mitune: its an intern for WW lol
[2:41:31] KuruxGaming: Ion is wow's politician
[2:41:31] UlyssesPaxton: Ion is a good face man for WoW. He was a player first.
[2:41:33] Frank4LuLz: Ion is THE RAZOR
[2:41:36] Shrandamar: Holinka is doing classes right?
[2:41:37] LoremasterMarthan: Wowhead designs my class thickSMILER
[2:41:39] sprert: Well if Ion would be the only one, it would explain the current prograss of the next patch
[2:41:39] BubbaChubbs420: Ion made it all
[2:42:04] swordart_19: True
[2:42:04] swinkeh: if i was a dev for a class i wouldnt want ppl to know me, ud get so much crap
[2:42:08] Thoreya: if ion leaves im scared
[2:42:13] bobmcfob: I wonder how much Activision is influencing changes
[2:42:19] Frank4LuLz: Legion was so awesome

[2:42:32] Brandonhipster: Legion was great.
[2:42:35] Knocx: he works for ncsoft now
[2:42:38] robertjordan83: @Towelliee he left after legion

[2:43:26] Thoreya: you can honestly see how much of a shitshow blizz is when you look at like indeed job reviews and stuff ppl say a lot there
[2:43:36] LoseAlotLuke: I swear everyone just leaves blizzard lol
[2:43:42] KaisenSiru: Calling it next week
[2:43:57] thiccsushi: its usually 3 weeks of prog
[2:44:23] swordart_19: @thoreya so big they make billions doesn't add up
[2:44:23] Shrandamar: they need the raid to stay hard because 9.1 is so far away lol
[2:45:16] Supergluten: is Twolallie sitting on da ground?
[2:45:19] lastdeo: is this the longest?
[2:45:19] Templexx: do we still think its a few months out?
[2:45:22] xxcujozxx: what was it 14 months of SoO?
[2:45:29] xxcujozxx: and how many of HFC?
[2:45:31] swordart_19: They overnerfed sludge needlessly
[2:45:48] grimblymcgoo: End of expansion is not the same as mid expansion though. SoE and HFC dont compare
[2:45:56] grimblymcgoo: SoO*

[2:47:11] MrGhostlore: We are like 6 months from the new expansion announcement. That is what is scary
[2:47:13] KuruxGaming: We may be in SL for almost 2.5 years at this point
[2:47:17] mavericks312: i could see them being back in HQ by atleast mid may
[2:47:19] Mitune: This could be the longest simply because it is 10.0 which should be huge
[2:47:24] raldrik: I am hoping it is shorter because it is likely separate teams
[2:47:24] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[2:47:41] swordwindgaming: Whens the next WoW anniversary?
[2:47:47] grimblymcgoo: How were they not doing conference video calls while working from home? Covid definitely affected the work, but i feel like now the excuse is just being overused
[2:47:48] Brandonhipster: yeah i have a feeling this will be a 3 year expansion
[2:47:58] Supergluten: untard for a sec, what is the meaning of the anima? not anime...
[2:48:06] rpc111: Blizzards in decline cant expect them to produce at the same pace anymore

[2:49:09] Frank4LuLz: old engine problems
[2:49:09] MrGhostlore: yeah. 9.1 - 9.2 - 10.0
[2:49:13] Mitune: It could last longer if they do a huge renovation of things. Essentially a mini expansion
[2:49:14] Shrandamar: I have a feeling whatever was 9.3 is now 9.2 and the end of the expansion
[2:49:14] MapenEG: they already gave us flying.
[2:49:17] Supergluten: guys... untard for a moment pls, the anima draught
[2:49:18] king_julian_96: I think we will still get a 9.3 towelliee

[2:50:15] CrispyNugs: TBC how soon do we think boys? August release?!
[2:50:21] manmower: weren't they transparent for Shadowlands release delay?
[2:50:29] itsjustin_ow: They don’t want to scare investors
[2:50:31] smashinu187: I feel like wow/blizz is just in this weird state of flux and it just feels like they dont even know what to do with the future of the game anymore....
[2:50:34] Unciatim: The unsubbing is what caused them to get rid of mth to mth subs...
[2:50:48] fistofnature: pepeMeltdown expansion over pepeMeltdown
[2:50:52] Frank4LuLz: lose our minds and unsub and burn down the joint
[2:50:58] Brandonhipster: yeah he been real shhhh
[2:51:08] Medobolt: i really hope they dont abandon SL i love it PepeClap
[2:51:09] YardRage: just give us a lick, Blizz Kappa
[2:51:10] LoremasterMarthan: Yea and like someone said, in a "normal" year, we are like 6 months from when we would normally start seeing hints at the next expansion already lol
[2:51:16] Mitune: Yeah, they are probably a bit of disorganized mess, and dont quite know for sure themselves
[2:51:20] brian_777777777: end of shadows: we didnt think we'd actually get this far
[2:51:22] Supergluten: @Towelliee  did i get shadowbanned sir?

[2:52:04] Shrandamar: they've gone completely silent since blizzcon, it's spooky
[2:52:12] parrzival1: sup
[2:52:24] Frank4LuLz: 17 years X 12 months X 14 bucks, plus expansion costs, hell ya we entitled
[2:52:27] Bulgogiprince: Comparing FFXIV and WoW dev work is ultimately just showing the difference between NA and Japanese work culture
[2:52:30] rpc111: Notice how things are getting worse with their output across the board
[2:52:31] ChedaPlays: Sadly they will blame it on Covid, i mean i know covid still is around, but they could made a different aproach like u said, more connected to community and players.

[2:55:45] jerexify: @Towelliee I didn't even know about legendaries in Legion... That was before I was in a guild, and only played by myself. I wasn't very involved.
[2:55:45] Kalidin79: I didnt get them all, but i got what i wanted
[2:55:48] Bombayshow: I did 24/32
[2:55:50] Bombayshow: Im sad
[2:55:51] j_bar111: I got all 36 apperances
[2:55:53] niebvelungen: I got all classes for all specs
[2:55:54] BlueBlurPrime: I just didnt get the healer ones, hated working on that couldnt time it right
[2:55:58] Bombayshow: 36*
[2:56:01] Medobolt: oh i forgot about those KEKW
[2:56:09] Geesmiley: Mage Tower was one of the best features of Legion
[2:56:11] KaisenSiru: Also got all 36 appearances
[2:56:13] Nico_vdM: I came back about 5 weeks before BFA and had enough time to get some of the appearances I wanted
[2:56:21] Nico_vdM: I am only sad that I didnt go for havoc one
[2:56:25] Jarlan23: should we save our soul ash or should i make a lego right now for funsies?
[2:56:34] CardinalTX: Mage tower great success. And they never did it again
[2:56:37] Medobolt: i got them on NA but to go play EU PepeHands
[2:56:37] shawnmsmall35: I was not good enough to be able to do the Mage Tower runs
[2:56:42] j_bar111: The healing ones were the hardest for me b/c of the last phase and having to not be at full health with how much gear i had
[2:56:43] Medobolt: but had to*
[2:57:02] elijuhxx: how do you stay so invested into the same game for such a longtime?? I wish i could do this
[2:57:09] LoremasterMarthan: THe most upsetting thing that I missed was the weapon/armor appearences from MoP/WoD before M+ existed
[2:57:14] LoremasterMarthan: some of the coolest xmog they ever did
[2:57:23] ChedaPlays: Would u ilke to see opening of Mage tower, but u can only unlock base appereance?
[2:57:53] Brandonhipster: i will be down for that
[2:57:53] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:57:53] j_bar111: @LoremasterMarthan I only got the lock CM set, im sad i didnt get the WOD weapons
[2:57:54] tposingsnorlax: I missed out on a ton of mage towers, cause I was lazy FeelsBadMan
[2:58:04] ChedaPlays: True.
[2:58:04] jerexify: Don't get me wrong, I'm very sad I can't get that bear form, but I don't think they should allow people to get it now. A new one, sure, but not the same one.
[2:58:11] jerexify: That takes away its uniqueness.

[2:58:30] corncob78: thoughts on Jeff leaving?
[2:58:30] Mitune: Are they going to be doing anymore with torg in 9.1 or is what they have added/been datamined really going to be it/
[2:58:39] Roadskii: Torghast would be better than the Mage Tower if they added things like appearances etc.
[2:58:44] cruzeal: i just want the white werebear form that's it
[2:58:45] Calphurnious: @daisyxivern I really regret not getting gold on my mage in mop personally.
[2:59:04] Bombayshow: corncob78 everyone leaving blizz its the new trend
[2:59:06] Medobolt: just nf blink
[2:59:10] tposingsnorlax: @Calphurnious I was just hella bad abck then, so didn't get them done either. Nor the Draenor ones.
[2:59:13] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee With all the news of major team members leaving  Blizzard does this make you worried about the future of the game ( new expansions being released)?
[2:59:25] Brandonhipster: demon gate on my lock LUL
[2:59:26] Spaede: one was called Zhovals Latrine i believe
[2:59:30] ChedaPlays: For corridors, u gonna do them once for Ach and then u done :D
[2:59:40] Geesmiley: mage tower had just the right amount of effort versus reward, the rewards were decent and it wasn't a calk walk, had to put forth some effort to make progress
[2:59:51] Geesmiley: cake walk*
[2:59:58] Bombayshow: Geesmiley until you had full heroic antorus , Yes
[3:00:10] Unciatim: Hunters, locks and tanks... 210
[3:00:10] LoremasterMarthan: I really think they should let you farm corridors for soul ash beyond the artificial cap that is here now so that people can catch up
[3:00:11] Bombayshow: after that it was a faceroll if you knew mech
[3:00:27] luckfore: i think it looks great
[3:00:29] Morrdock: !room
[3:00:30] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:00:43] deathrift991: Looks more like ICC then torghast to me
[3:00:48] raldrik: looking forward to the mega dungeon that looks amazing
[3:00:50] Redbearded16: Druid in TC can pretty much knock the whole thing out at 210
[3:00:53] dalaraz: the moment i saw the torghast theme i was kinda sigh
[3:00:54] aikopooh: that 9.1 raid is just re used torghast and called raid Kappa
[3:00:58] Brandonhipster: oh there a boss that uses anima powrrs
[3:00:59] Bombayshow: deathrift991 they have the same music
[3:00:59] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee With all the news of major team members leaving Blizzard does this make you worried about the future of the game ( new expansions being released)?
[3:01:23] swordwindgaming: sorry Towellie none of us have WoW for a job lol
[3:01:25] ChedaPlays: I was assuming , that they will do 4 raids  based on covenants. plus one that is tottaly unique for the last one.. idk thats me
[3:01:27] rpc111: All blizz has is stuff they have in storage lol
[3:01:31] Medobolt: it looks different for me tbh like its same place but different enough
[3:01:42] luckfore: some of the boss rooms have a different theme
[3:01:55] ravenoushydra: I hope every raid this expansion is just a different torghast wing Kappa
[3:01:57] Frank4LuLz: change it to the Dreamscape of Emerald Dreams... KEKW @Towelliee
[3:02:00] Almanes: wait this isnt the new raid?
[3:02:08] swordart_19: @towelliee Do you think after raid there will be revealing moment like after Tomb of Sargeras we have seen Argus?
[3:02:16] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[3:02:19] Mitune: It just more maw theme when people are tired of the theme already
[3:02:23] LoremasterMarthan: On a seperate note, how do we feel that after all the hullabaloo about getting the "maw specific" mounts, you are going to be able to just use whatever in 9.1 anyway?
[3:02:27] icemanj99: Well that explains the torture part of Torghast, repetitive instances that go on and on and on...
[3:02:35] McGreeb: How much longer do you think the patch would take if they had to design and build whole new environments for the raid
[3:02:40] rpc111: Cant wait for classic legion lol
[3:02:58] luckfore: we shouldve gotten 9.1 around this time and gotten 9.2 ptr in a couple weeks
[3:03:02] king_julian_96: Have you tested the 2 new raid bosses
[3:03:04] fooxytv: Ads 1 of 8?
[3:03:09] jerexify: @Towelliee Are you going to get your DK prepared, too, or is that one not on your list?
[3:03:10] Ludiaro: funny you say that @towelliee i did click on the stream cause the title says ptr boss tank and saw torghast on the thumbnail and thought you were raid testing
[3:03:11] aikopooh: havent lost "yet"
[3:03:32] Ludiaro: jebaited
[3:03:43] Xenrawr: but still give your CEO a $200m bonus!
[3:03:44] Ertra: @Ludiaro it also says PREP
[3:04:34] K2K_Ex12: @Towelliee i have a quick question what class is the easiest to level to max level? because ive tried most of them but i dont know xD
[3:04:48] NAT0_141: 8 ads chain is brutal. Thankfully the towel stream is still running in the corner
[3:04:58] Redpandalol: @towelliee I’m taking it as a grain of salt. But asmongold was saying one more person is leaving blizz. Jeff was a surprise
[3:05:12] luckfore: hows morale of there
[3:05:20] swordwindgaming: 2 million can't fix anything. Kappa
[3:05:21] PvtHudson093: he could buy us the Sloth pet by donating the rest needed
[3:05:26] mabrno: Yo, have you moved?
[3:05:33] shadowgrove88: think strian of bfa and covid hit SL hard tbh
[3:05:36] Shrandamar: !room
[3:05:36] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon™
[3:05:37] PvtHudson093: !room
[3:05:40] Frank4LuLz: Need to give Raises, it expensive to live in California, especially in Irvine, poor low levels
[3:05:40] SteamAlpaca: @Towelliee Do you think they'll release classic Cataclysm? Or Mop?
[3:05:41] VictorAvalanche: !room
[3:05:58] Mitune: I dunno SL feels like WoD 2.0 to me
[3:06:00] king_julian_96: so towelliee if 9.1 takes as long as it looks like it is going to do you think 9.2 at the earliest will be January 2022
[3:06:04] mabrno: !ROOM
[3:06:17] aikopooh: yep
[3:06:18] VictorAvalanche: lol Wod 2.0
[3:06:19] Sch1ey: yeahhh
[3:06:23] swordart_19: 0 chance
[3:06:25] brian_777777777: cant wait to play some fresh DK
[3:06:28] dasdoody: Can't wait for WotLK
[3:06:29] Shugaze: arthas carrying wrath again
[3:06:29] Unciatim: WoD failed cause it was World Of Orcraft part 5 electric bugaloo
[3:06:29] LoremasterMarthan: Wrath will be the money maker if nothing else than the fact Ulduar is still THE best raid for a vast majority of the population
[3:06:32] brian_777777777: post nerf woooo
[3:06:36] DoubleNova: what would a prediction for a release on Wrath?
[3:06:42] Bombayshow: 365 days siege of org lasted, never forgetti
[3:06:43] rpc111: True wrath was amazing
[3:06:50] da_moosse: wrath is my shit
[3:06:50] zaraine1: even if you hate wrath , that expansion was just worth it for the music

[3:07:13] mattoxi: wrath 2024
[3:07:22] da_moosse: the wrathgate questline is the best in game
[3:07:29] rpc111: But i would never put it past blizzard to try to cash in twice on xpacs
[3:07:39] swinkeh: next q is twisting corridor to find anduin
[3:07:47] LoremasterMarthan: Wrathgate was only good because it was the first in game cinematic we ever got
[3:07:47] joe_g_433: I think after Thrall, there is signs of the lion quest
[3:07:49] brian_777777777: the dungeon crawl in ICC is better

[3:08:29] JeemTeam: oof
[3:08:45] Shugaze: wrath and cata babys
[3:08:45] LoremasterMarthan: If you were a hardcore raider, Wrath really wasnt the best. For everyone else, it is probably top 3
[3:08:45] Medobolt: if you missed the quest turn in. the followers should be the torg area
[3:08:46] stealthx23: wotlk was the start of the catch up system and i hated it
[3:08:47] dalaraz: they dont want your opinion if they dont like it :p @Towelliee

[3:21:22] ryte1676: twisting
[3:21:24] MrEvilRex: it is twisting coridor
[3:21:31] MrEvilRex: look at the bottom of the map
[3:21:37] YardRage: D:
[3:21:37] UmbraTeddy: i been meaning to try bahama mama
[3:21:38] tetsroth: it needs to be Twisting corridoes
[3:21:38] Unciatim: yes
[3:21:39] joe_g_433: TC only
[3:21:40] joker2880: Yeah
[3:21:42] StarbuckTech: renovations @Simuil
[3:21:42] Bezroth: yep
[3:21:43] ryte1676: no, you can do up to lvl 6, rinse repeat
[3:21:43] BlueBlurPrime: just do the first 6, then leave and repeat
[3:21:45] Ghoost172: you can just do 6 then leave and do 6 again if thats easier and faster for you
[3:21:47] igdr_: you can apparently do 6 and repeat
[3:21:51] igdr_: ye
[3:21:54] Broomba: i found first clue at level 6 found out every6 is clue, no you dont have to do all 18
[3:21:56] Bezroth: you can do the first 6 3 times
[3:22:07] Hyperitron: you dont have to do all 18
[3:22:08] BlueBlurPrime: floor 6 boss 3 times works
[3:22:09] tetsroth: first 6 floors
[3:22:09] dalaraz: you need 3 sets of 6  not a full 18 @Towelliee
[3:22:12] joker2880: You have to do 3 bosses in TC
[3:22:13] ryte1676: do layer 1, go up to floor 6.. leave repeat
[3:22:15] Bombayshow: faceroll it , you will get many followers
[3:22:17] ryte1676: yes
[3:22:17] Zeijun: 1-6 three times
[3:22:18] Bezroth: yep
[3:22:18] Hyperitron: yea
[3:22:22] BlueBlurPrime: yeah any layer works
[3:22:22] Hyperitron: that's what i did
[3:22:23] LoremasterMarthan: I mean you're still doing 18 floors either way arent you lol
[3:22:24] scrribbles: you get the item from the boss - so you do the first boss 3 times
[3:22:25] raptorstrick: There is like 3 hints in there
[3:23:21] joker2880: Bossess drop
[3:23:49] Bezroth: every sixth floor
[3:24:24] LoremasterMarthan: Well and now its even dumber because in 9.1 they are just gonna let you use whatever mounts you want come a certain point in the story
[3:24:24] joker2880: Same here, TC wasn't fun at all
[3:24:27] Bombayshow: Reward is accomplishment Kappa
[3:24:29] LoremasterMarthan: So there is even less reason to do corridors
[3:24:32] Cacos: I was one of those lucky SoB that got the mount at first try in the hunt in the Maw LULW
[3:24:47] SmuttBudgie: ^
[3:25:03] Bombayshow: LUL
[3:25:05] MrEvilRex: I wanted beta Tower of torgahst
[3:25:17] swinkeh: the reward is the friends you make along the way
[3:25:24] dianthusnemo: did all 8 layers - got my stuff and left - never going back
[3:25:29] UmbraTeddy: give me a new druid form for clearing like mage tower
[3:25:30] Crow_Bot: i still need to do TC for the mount, but i rarely have a 2 hour block to get shit done outside of raid
[3:25:34] dalaraz: i want less friends ,not more :p
[3:25:34] Seerated: Did that quest on my main, that's the one and only time I've set my foot in TC, fuck that.
[3:25:36] Kromede: STAHP
[3:25:41] beckett3a: the reward is not having to play it anymore
[3:25:45] zaraine1: well that sounds like a you problem LUL
[3:25:49] shimwood: What are friends? I only have WoW
[3:25:53] Cacos: Would it be that bad if they awarded you with a free socket after completing the corridor till end? Capped at one per week?
[3:25:53] Kromede: thoon ConcernDoge
[3:25:55] swordart_19: Twisting Corridors instead of fast speed/hype/epic music you put music for sleeping instead and slowly fall asleep while doing it.
[3:26:12] LoremasterMarthan: "we did it, we won. now what do we do?" "we uh... we play the game"
[3:26:12] Crow_Bot: TC needed a save game option
[3:26:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: as soon as i finished layer 8 twisting and got the mount i never went back to the maw LUL
[3:26:16] Broomba: what time do the construction guys come over and start work @towelliee

[3:26:55] crimestream: Simpsons quote: "This is boring. Make it crash or something." "Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the scale-model pilot."
[3:26:56] normysan: Yeah, twisting is so unrewarding
[3:27:16] LoremasterMarthan: At a decent pace of say... 1.5ish hours for each level to do all 18 floors, you are putting in like.. 12 hours of mindless grinding for a title and a mount

[3:27:17] Crow_Bot: Should have been 4 layers instead of 8

[3:27:36] JeemTeam: yes
[3:27:42] raldrik: and it is work because it scales so hard after floor 15 that if you dont get good powers you just wasted hours

[3:28:04] SilverAlix: Atleast islands looked nice
[3:28:05] McGreeb: I have only done 1 layer on my Paladin because i just cant bring myself to spend 7 more hours in TC
[3:28:08] shimwood: MRAAAZ

[4:30:57] Crowdog76: Whats your guess on 9.1 release?
[4:30:57] Unciatim: They probably are replacing them.... cause when  the lay the flooring , they might have to adjust the floor boards so their aren't any gaps...
[4:31:17] Bulgogiprince: In Korea a lot of the floors are mostly concrete
[4:31:20] biggiemcg33: They remove the baseboards to put the floor down so that it can contract and expand over the subfloor.  There will be new or put back the old ones
[4:31:20] Crow_Bot: End of June to mid-July is my guess

[5:24:41] theDirtyon3: So anthem 2.0? Kappa
[5:24:50] Lycis: basically
[5:24:53] 91Niki: If a beta has keys, odds are PandaTV has them

[5:25:26] YardRage: oh, did you need that inventory? my bad Kappa
[5:25:57] Lycis: Double Frozen o.o
[5:26:32] A_New_Challenger: Anthem faced a loot and mission loop issue, and outriders didn't have either of those problems. Outriders is really good, but kinda a quick fling - is what it is and fun while it lasts
[5:26:35] Chiraakitteh: They announced that they would be replacing the missing legendaries with god roll versions
[5:26:37] VinnyDaPoooh: nah they didnt give gear back just "fixed" the bug
[5:27:09] DonMateo83: what happened?

[5:27:30] BubbaChubbs420: maybe you can have a priest pull you out of limbo LuL
[5:27:49] SeckSymbols: 70 Hours is more than most games
[5:28:03] Lycis: Outriders faced an unnecessary online part which quickly destroyed trust credits
[5:28:18] A_New_Challenger: To me Outriders was like an arcadie condensed Division. All the fun flying right at you, but it doesn't try to keep you coming back or sinking time the way the division did
[5:28:23] wraaith: i wonder how many hours played for everyone one wow
[5:28:25] Trippletea: ever play borderlands? :p

[5:28:47] BubbaChubbs420: you earn trust credits? LuL
[5:28:50] Lycis: LUL
[5:29:05] SeckSymbols: Outriders wasn't intended to be a game that has an extensive endgame
[5:29:07] SeckSymbols: It had a set end to it
[5:29:25] SeckSymbols: It fulfilled what it was supposed to fulfill
[5:29:27] A_New_Challenger: Agreed. I really enjoyed my time with it and will prob pop in some more, but I like that it didn't try to become my new game
[5:29:46] Wcvechten: Hope that tthe upcoming build fixes it
[5:29:52] Trippletea: NotLikeThis
