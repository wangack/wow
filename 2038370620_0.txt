[0:19:33] acaciashrub: i think haste on crits talent for boomy is big
[0:19:42] bomzzwtf: You use mangle, and shred with clear casting
[0:19:42] GamerGierr: You will never use claw
[0:19:47] Sinostra: mangle is just a better claw
[0:20:09] Sinostra: tranqui for resto ?
[0:20:12] jaykray369: is hurricane  bad aoe spell for boomy?
[0:20:25] cyanne112: would you even go boomkin form instead of NS?
[0:20:50] Sinostra: would resto use tranqui ?
[0:20:51] acaciashrub: natures grace
[0:21:28] cyanne112: you dont really get wrath procs in pvp lol
[0:22:22] cyanne112: moonfury is just based dmg increase, it has no scaling
[0:22:26] bassiemon123: Heyo heroHYPERS
[0:23:17] bassiemon123: I am hyped, got my new desk + chair. Setting everything up, excited to play in a bit.
[0:23:17] cyanne112: depending on how much SP we get from gnom gear you might even pass it
[0:23:43] GamerGierr: If you're resto you will be using travel form and not cat for movement speed
[0:23:44] fakemejo: what do u lose by going skull bash?
[0:24:14] chrishjan: star surge on 42 yard range that stuns people with 200% crit dmg? ye pls
[0:24:47] Sinostra: you need to take imp healing touch anyways
[0:24:49] Sinostra: for NS
[0:25:16] cyanne112: going further than NS seems so useless
[0:25:17] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist

[0:26:40] vrsswow: vrsswow watched 15 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[0:26:40] cyanne112: regardless you still try to get 1 point in NG
[0:26:43] SireTV: hey @Hydramist - at 60, what was the pvp tier list in classic era/som? trying to pick a main based on that, not based on current phase 1 tier lists.
[0:28:15] Sinostra: i don't think people will take nature's grasp without spending the 4 points to improve it
[0:28:22] Sinostra: is it worth it on its own ?
[0:28:34] perozx: perozx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! wadup romeyoyo
[0:28:47] acaciashrub: it’s good vs classes that attack fast even with 1pt
[0:28:53] Lindstedt_: 5/5 mark?
[0:29:03] Sinostra: 35% is kinda bad
[0:29:23] cyanne112: bash
[0:29:24] Lindstedt_: charge
[0:29:26] Lindstedt_: or bash
[0:29:27] fakemejo: bash
[0:29:27] cyanne112: or charge
[0:29:35] Lindstedt_: Raor
[0:29:38] Lindstedt_: people out of stealth
[0:29:44] cyanne112: its A LOT better than imp motw anyway
[0:30:01] Rtxyy: will be there arenas in phase 2 ?
[0:30:28] cyanne112: @Sinostra its crazy good and more or less mandatory in a pvp spec. it lasts 45 sec
[0:30:36] Rtxyy: ??
[0:31:16] jjshiffy: good idea
[0:31:35] Gac_Ttv: @Hydramist will shadow be good dps with full shadow tree talents at lvl 40?
[0:31:38] Rtxyy: Guys there will be arena in phase 2 of sod ?
[0:31:49] Sinostra: @cyanne112 yeah, but are 4 points not worth to get to 100% ?
[0:31:58] lilputien: @Rtxyy never
[0:32:00] LoobGaming: STV style arena
[0:32:12] chrishjan: they said they dnt wanna focus on pvp and rather focus on pumping content
[0:33:45] cyanne112: @Sinostra not really, its good enough as it is.
[0:34:10] lilputien: at least they can put skirmish
[0:34:49] Lindstedt_: 10
[0:35:12] guidelock: mage is king and its not a discussion GIGACHAD
[0:35:17] guidelock: o7
[0:37:15] Sinostra: problem is : how do we check spells paladins get in p2 ?
[0:37:17] vepsee: we'll prob get another 12, 4 for 3 new slots
[0:37:42] lilputien: hpal will be good lvl 40
[0:37:47] Lindstedt_: did u do fc druid tree?
[0:38:13] cyanne112: might or parry
[0:38:17] cyanne112: not much of a choice
[0:39:02] chrishjan: not as an enchant byt we get AB BOOTS
[0:39:06] chrishjan: move speed
[0:39:35] chrishjan: eye 4 eye is insane
[0:40:48] exp_wraith: ~15% crit with bfd gear

[0:44:36] fakemejo: avenger shield super op, only slow they got
[0:44:36] chrishjan: ur suggesting to replace ur only slow?
[0:44:40] chrishjan: cmon
[0:46:39] Sinostra: and that's kinda it
[0:47:18] Sinostra: that aura is only useful to priests and palas anyways
[0:47:30] cyanne112: if you are doing group pvp/wsg ofc you drop it, you have plenty of better slows in your team
[0:48:14] Mystylerocks: HeyGuys
[0:48:33] secondfiddlejk: what is that addon that shows spells that u can train at higher levels?
[0:49:12] Mystylerocks: @secondfiddlejk WhatsTraining
[0:49:49] secondfiddlejk: thanks @Mystylerocks
[0:50:06] Sinostra: and shield lasts 2 sec longer
[0:50:26] Cupz21: !bis
[0:50:26] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AuG_Cve3KE
[0:50:33] Mystylerocks: any fresh bfd's? can tank on msr
[0:51:08] Mystylerocks: yea cleanse 42 hammer 44 is quite big
[0:51:33] fakemejo: holy shock for holy
[0:51:45] fakemejo: nvm thats talent
[0:52:40] Mystylerocks: wisdom seal is quite big in terms of PvE especially for prots
[0:53:05] Mystylerocks: in pvp nah
[0:54:30] Mystylerocks: conc 1 for sure for stealthies
[0:54:32] Mystylerocks: f1
[0:54:34] Mystylerocks: r1*
[0:55:33] Mystylerocks: u would go 3/3 hit and bop/freedom for sure
[0:56:11] psykfall69: dont u play 2h still?
[0:56:24] HeyImArty: does not work on HoJ
[0:57:05] Sinostra: don't think so, especially with hunters
[0:57:12] Sinostra: hunters already have kings
[0:58:09] HeyImArty: Double checked spell data, precision only affects things that require a melee weapon
[0:58:14] HeyImArty: So doesnt affect HoJ or judge
[0:58:23] Ziadibrahim7: u uploading that spreadsheet anywere?
[0:58:40] Mystylerocks: my brain's all confused, i think its in wotlk that the hit talent has big value. probably full holy is the way. the bop/freedom talent is nice but not worth the detour in prot (as 40)
[0:59:08] HeyImArty: hydraKit Mayhem?
[0:59:11] HeyImArty: Whats tinyKitten upto
[0:59:24] staun: Awesome! Thank you for doing this
[0:59:39] HeyImArty: only "value" is imp conc aura but eeeeh
[0:59:59] Sinostra: you event added n/a to prot
[1:00:01] Mystylerocks: yeah with sod talents, i would. played pala for so long! lacking conc vs holy shield is gonna be a thing though
[1:00:07] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[1:00:15] HeyImArty: You can skip Prot then Ryan
[1:00:18] HeyImArty: next class kekw
[1:00:22] Mystylerocks: ez skip
[1:00:55] Sinostra: it could only become relevant with runes
[1:01:03] Sinostra: and we can't prediect that
[1:01:08] Sinostra: predict*
[1:01:11] HeyImArty: Prot will not be relevant because Holy Shield costs your entire mana pool & your firstborn kid, the only "value" is imp conc aura
[1:01:19] Mystylerocks: AM CONC POG? #prayge
[1:01:24] cyanne112: thing is for a hpala HS is kinda bad, but if they get some runes interacting with it, like reducing cd/letting it proc instant FL like wrath, then its gonna be good
[1:02:05] HeyImArty: Safely willing to bet "no" on prot pally unless they get some godtier runes
[1:02:08] Mystylerocks: i mean if rogues and warriors are the meta u might as well haha
[1:02:55] Mystylerocks: if they get smthn that gives % to get back the cooldown for avenger shield
[1:02:56] Mystylerocks: ooof
[1:03:46] Sinostra: yeah, but you can't assume runes
[1:03:50] skyttone: !newvid
[1:03:51] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT8n61Bgc60
[1:05:02] HeyImArty: TinyKitten cam when
[1:05:53] JonaDefty: ele is the real deal at 40
[1:05:59] Mystylerocks: ele feels like almost all talents are big
[1:06:02] Mystylerocks: cantwait
[1:06:10] HeyImArty: Ele with overload sounds fucking hilarious
[1:06:10] JonaDefty: ele gets realy nice ranks compared to 25 too
[1:06:11] HeyImArty: hydraGoose
[1:06:13] parla: orc
[1:06:15] Superabbit35: orc

[1:06:19] krashxx: Tauren!
[1:06:22] fakemejo: troll
[1:06:23] Mystylerocks: orc is the way but warstorm for ele is huge too
[1:06:24] satras12: orc male shaman bis
[1:06:27] parla: tauren is cooler tho
[1:06:28] psykfall69: orc 25% stun resist too good
[1:06:33] JonaDefty: female tauren
[1:06:33] HeyImArty: Stun resist is way more banter
[1:06:37] cyanne112: tauren, orc dmg racial doesnt do anything
[1:06:56] HeyImArty: Stun resist makes Pshero tilt, thats worth
[1:06:58] krashxx: Tauren !
[1:07:02] luzid7: i always go tauren because of the melee range
[1:07:22] ntmutant: ntmutant watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Tauren female chad
[1:07:22] Mystylerocks: if u play ele then tauren if enha  go orc
[1:07:24] Mystylerocks: ez solution
[1:07:26] DanUK_47: In Phase 2 dps rankings where will shadow priest be
[1:07:35] SoMoistv: the extra 5% hp also nice
[1:07:50] m0n3ybadger: what spec would you play?
[1:07:50] biglychillin: Just go tauren
[1:07:52] HeyImArty: Romeboy is already human priest
[1:07:54] HeyImArty: you've memed enough
[1:07:55] JonaDefty: tauren for the boys
[1:07:56] HeyImArty: go orc
[1:08:32] m0n3ybadger: Tauren. the orc blood fury only applies to attack power
[1:08:33] HeyImArty: Human priest in classic still hurts

[1:09:53] biglychillin: dang, i was about to name my guy that
[1:09:59] luzid7: stun resist only helps vs rogues and tauren range helps anytime
[1:09:59] lerler: oh this name is bis
[1:10:04] cyanne112: a rogue will still shut you down. stun resist or no
[1:10:23] fakemejo: aaaaand its gone

[1:14:37] cyanne112: yeah and u need to get the 5 useless points in moonfire crit too
[1:14:40] cyanne112: so its 10
[1:15:29] wholelottabobb: just tuning in, did you already talk ab enhance?
[1:15:52] JonaDefty: i'd drop convection for the fire nova delay and fire totem dmg
[1:16:26] Poffinator: gonna feel cool when shamans can talent to do what hunters did this phase
[1:16:27] luzid7: fire totem is also good becuase almost no one skill it and people don't realize how fast your nova totem procs
[1:16:38] JonaDefty: wait till you see the ranks too
[1:16:48] Mystylerocks: ele is is to S as in SEND them to the graveyard tier for sure
[1:17:09] fiskensfriend: has hydra done mage yet?
[1:17:24] JonaDefty: water shield competes with lava burst
[1:17:25] Mystylerocks: no water shield cuz lava burst is hands
[1:17:30] Mystylerocks: we do use LS
[1:18:09] SoMoistv: I think u use cleansing instead
[1:18:12] Mystylerocks: in PvP u usually drop poison cleanse
[1:18:15] Superabbit35: rather have cleansing totem
[1:18:19] Mystylerocks: or disease cleanse
[1:18:42] screwu666: but can ele even finish the cast before he is dead from backstab, warrior mortal strike , hunter pet or boomie starsurges and spam of moonfire?
[1:19:30] fakemejo: all shaman speccs gets mail also :>
[1:19:33] JonaDefty: purge rank 2
[1:19:59] Superabbit35: well in 1v1 it's tough but in team play ele gonna be crazy, it's either tunnel them down or instantly die
[1:20:08] HeyImArty: Ryan missing the most important ability of all

[1:20:33] Reckoner64: right isnt lb like 2.5second cast
[1:20:36] Reckoner64: thats brutal
[1:20:41] Mystylerocks: windwall totem, so many random shit
[1:20:42] Mystylerocks: lmao
[1:20:42] jazni_23: sentry totem might be bugged still to help negate fall damage, not sure if it's fixed in sod
[1:20:48] JonaDefty: ye
[1:21:04] eXTreMe1337: this wants me to multibox ele again like it did in original vanilla/bc/wotlk back in the days
[1:21:06] JonaDefty: wait for windwall rune
[1:21:09] bayernmunchen90: played since 2005 never heard of that totem
[1:21:11] prodigy_wow: never seen that hah
[1:21:21] JonaDefty: it makes an actual wall of wind
[1:21:24] JonaDefty: you cant pass through
[1:21:30] prodigy_wow: blocks projectiles lol
[1:21:37] Mystylerocks: searing totem 40
[1:21:45] Mystylerocks: that thing can be nasty long term
[1:21:48] cyanne112: wasnt there a thing with windwall totem and stopping fall dmg?
[1:21:50] JustOndore: Shamans are gonna be nasty
[1:22:10] Sinostra: disease cleansing totem seems nice too

[1:23:25] eXTreMe1337: what about grounding totem with 30?
[1:23:37] SoMoistv: ^
[1:23:43] bayernmunchen90: how will windfury totem work with wild strikes?
[1:24:01] JonaDefty: ankh i guess lol
[1:24:05] massesto: reincarnation
[1:24:16] Sinostra: Astral recall op
[1:24:39] Mystylerocks: as ele i will use rockbiter for shamanistic rage mana gains (mind you when i dw with double rockbiter i get ~80/mp1!)
[1:24:50] Superabbit35: Earth Shock is quite good for enhance
[1:24:59] eXTreMe1337: rockbiter dw still for shamanistic rage management regen maybe, but prob not in pvp
[1:25:00] JonaDefty: 100% lvling sham second
[1:25:07] bayernmunchen90: well resto shamans need something
[1:25:13] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[1:25:13] eXTreMe1337: maybe outfight runeswitch
[1:25:33] Mystylerocks: for sure u have to, is gun be so much fun
[1:26:26] DarianaTW: resistance totems for boomy, mage fire and more
[1:26:26] WallyJustice: everoytn has a shaman in era
[1:26:32] WallyJustice: or sod
[1:26:52] WallyJustice: mage shaman war non negotiable
[1:26:54] WallyJustice: lol
[1:27:15] massesto: warlocks are gonna go crazy at level 40
[1:27:24] DarianaTW: you can play melee lava burst now with wf weapon
[1:27:30] JustOndore: Have we done warlocks yet @Hydramist
[1:27:43] hagbulbia: do warlocks!
[1:28:05] bassiemon123: Ayy Just in time
[1:28:12] WallyJustice: B tier
[1:28:34] rns_aurelius: is way of earth on the same slot as dual wield spec?
[1:28:44] bassiemon123: Stormstrike will hit with both weapons wich is kinda nice. Ele Just way more dominant.
[1:28:45] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @rns_aurelius no
[1:28:56] DarianaTW: grounding
[1:29:16] bassiemon123: For tanking prob water shield
[1:29:21] bassiemon123: If they dual wield
[1:29:28] Sinostra: @JustOndore nope, waiting for it
[1:29:31] DarianaTW: pve stuff
[1:30:11] VcodeXOXO: imp str totem for urself and team if u wanna put the point there
[1:30:26] the_moist_factory: wouldnt they be dual weilding
[1:30:27] bassiemon123: Drop 2h
[1:30:33] the_moist_factory: so the 2 hander kinda not good?
[1:30:42] bassiemon123: Hmm
[1:30:49] bassiemon123: Yee it would be great
[1:30:54] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: you can't drop it to get the totem increase
[1:30:55] cyanne112: and you lose 30% hp
[1:31:24] niku_baku: might get a 2h rune for phase 2
[1:31:44] bassiemon123: Ye will hit with both weapons
[1:31:48] fakemejo: ngl all runes for shamans r kinda meh
[1:32:09] cajli: you think priest will be able to swap racials in later phases?
[1:32:16] the_moist_factory: have you seen warrior runes
[1:32:38] the_moist_factory: warriors rn are god awful
[1:33:31] Mystylerocks: does toughness give slow resist in classic for shamans? i dont remember
[1:33:32] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: @the_moist_factory they were never good before mortal strike
[1:33:36] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: and intercept
[1:33:46] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: also pummel
[1:33:53] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: phase2 warriors are very big
[1:34:11] wholelottabobb: i currently tank without using any tank runes as enhance. sham rage, dw spec, lava lash. hoping you can do this next phase
[1:34:13] wholelottabobb: like fury prot
[1:34:25] the_moist_factory: warriors will still lose to rets and most casters
[1:34:51] the_moist_factory: like SP are going to be the biggest thing next phase and they destroy warriors
[1:34:57] DarianaTW: 3,5
[1:34:58] Mystylerocks: not much at least 25
[1:35:06] bisonkron: never once you get chain heal
[1:35:19] cyanne112: idk man losing 30% hp, 10% DR AND double shock never seems worth it lol
[1:35:50] Mystylerocks: i cast so little healing wave as rshaman in current ph1 that i went for healing rain, pretty neat when wsg groups play in that area. it can crit and proc a trash buff (ancestral thingy)
[1:36:28] Sinostra: pushback reduction is always a no brainer
[1:36:39] DarianaTW: pushback now is insane
[1:36:42] Mystylerocks: idk so many pets i went for healing focus
[1:36:45] Mystylerocks: its giga must
[1:36:46] DarianaTW: you need that even in pve
[1:37:23] Mystylerocks: maybe as pvp skip tide and that dumb pve spring
[1:37:30] Mystylerocks: and stop it at purification or even just NS
[1:37:50] ephixa_fan: hydraLeigh
[1:38:01] DarianaTW: for that you need reduction cast
[1:38:43] Mystylerocks: grounding cd too
[1:38:44] fakemejo: - shock cost?
[1:38:52] Mystylerocks: on the left side of the enha crit
[1:38:53] luscombe24: grounding cd
[1:39:02] DarianaTW: grounding cd
[1:39:05] eXTreMe1337: grounding cd
[1:39:22] Mystylerocks: for sure looks solid
[1:39:34] Mystylerocks: can cheese 1 pt of totems for ancestral trash buff
[1:39:36] Mystylerocks: "trash"
[1:39:45] Mystylerocks: out of totem mana cost*
[1:41:35] eXTreMe1337: hope resto will get some sort of instantheal/hot rune
[1:41:49] screwu666: sounds like riptide might actually make it to the runes
[1:41:58] screwu666: riptide would be a game change
[1:42:06] screwu666: and the earth grab totem
[1:42:26] screwu666: i hate to cast 3 seconds of healing wave more
[1:42:32] screwu666: or the yellow piss
[1:43:02] Sinostra: you can already add MS to the war
[1:43:32] DarianaTW: rend deep and impale
[1:43:40] EX_Skenn: never
[1:43:44] HeyImArty: you will never heroic strike
[1:43:47] HeyImArty: you dont have the rage for it
[1:44:09] Skibat: quick strike benefits from heroic cost though
[1:44:16] EX_Skenn: I think you go full tactical at 40, you need to swap around stances
[1:44:27] DucktorLarsen: you can't stance disarm if you're only 3/5. it cost 20 rage
[1:44:31] HeyImArty: HeyImArty subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! weapon spec is just "whatever the best available weapon type is" next phase, i guess that depends on Gnomer raid loot
[1:44:34] JonaDefty: you wont quick strike in pvp
[1:45:13] screwu666: fml i forgot about mace stun :D OH NOOOOO
[1:45:17] screwu666: NOT AGAIN
[1:45:19] marcusjoncus: axe spec
[1:45:25] EX_Skenn: idk at 60 people mostly play axe or sword with R14 weapons
[1:45:26] screwu666: tbc flashbacks
[1:45:32] xoHaptix: warriors with pendulum gonna be gross idk
[1:45:34] screwu666: crowd pummeler with mace stun?
[1:45:55] Mystylerocks: isnt crowd pumm super fast AS tho
[1:45:56] JonaDefty: theres a new non consumable one
[1:45:56] xoHaptix: warriors can’t use pummeled @screwu666
[1:46:03] screwu666: god bless us
[1:46:08] xoHaptix: only paladin/shaman/druid
[1:46:08] HeyImArty: 4.0 speed Pendulum of Doom from Uldaman with Axe Spec ryan
[1:46:09] KALOVAYA_MACCA_CTACA: it will be 100%, every old BFD item is a new one in the raid
[1:46:13] Sinostra: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=210741/automatic-crowd-pummeler
[1:46:19] Sinostra: not usable by warriors
[1:46:34] EX_Skenn: I don't think imp charge is better than anger management honestly
[1:46:42] HeyImArty: its literally class restricted
[1:46:49] QuickfireDouble: class restricted
[1:46:50] ahlzera: Too fast aswell
[1:47:04] EX_Skenn: yeah but only 6, you get those fairly quick with anger management
[1:47:09] HeyImArty: you cant use it evne if you wanted to lmao
[1:47:11] reggieface420: isnt the mace class restricted
[1:47:11] HeyImArty: its pally sham druid
[1:47:12] the_moist_factory: you dont need anger managment cuz you will hardly be swapping stances cuz of warbringer
[1:47:12] marcusjoncus: maybe the axe from the last boss of gnomer will be epic wep :)
[1:47:20] EX_Skenn: the tooltip is wrong
[1:47:24] EX_Skenn: it gives you 1 rage every 3 sec
[1:47:25] reggieface420: anger management is actually bugged in classic, it gives rage
[1:47:27] reggieface420: yes
[1:47:28] Mystylerocks: it also hiddenly regenets 1 rage every 3
[1:47:30] HeyImArty: it adds 1 rage per 3 sec
[1:47:34] ahlzera: It also generates rage
[1:47:38] EX_Skenn: yes
[1:47:39] HeyImArty: yes
[1:47:41] EX_Skenn: all the time
[1:47:49] HeyImArty: the tooltip is an ancient relic from Vanilla
[1:47:59] HeyImArty: 1 per per 3sec = 30% slower out of combat rage decay
[1:48:08] HeyImArty: So its just a hidden permanent 1rage/3s
[1:48:20] EX_Skenn: can always remove points in 2h yeah
[1:48:35] reggieface420: is this for a pve or a pvp build? im assuming pvp?
[1:48:40] reggieface420: considering warbringer
[1:49:01] HeyImArty: Mortal Strike gonna go hard next patch
[1:49:20] ahlzera: Arms is bis in pve aswell next phase, so very similar
[1:49:38] EX_Skenn: @ahlzera nah the sim is better as fury, flurry is too good
[1:50:03] Kenny_Marsh: imp hamstring
[1:50:16] ahlzera: @ex_skenn i sim way higher as arms, cant afford to drop new deep wounds
[1:50:53] JonaDefty: its not very user friendly in pvp
[1:50:55] reggieface420: its hard to use consumed by rage in pvp
[1:50:57] JonaDefty: its amazing in pve though
[1:51:00] reggieface420: i use attack speed
[1:51:15] Kenny_Marsh: with endless rage maybe
[1:51:24] HeyImArty: rage potions exist next phase & they are cheap as chips
[1:51:32] HeyImArty: if you wanna meme with the consumed by rage
[1:51:54] the_moist_factory: lol
[1:51:56] Kenny_Marsh: consumed by rage -> sweeping -> mortal + WW
[1:51:59] Kenny_Marsh: one shot huntard
[1:52:13] HeyImArty: Rage pot gives you 30-60
[1:52:13] the_moist_factory: rage pooling is hard in pvp
[1:52:20] HeyImArty: rage pot & charge -> you have consume by rage
[1:52:25] reggieface420: quick strike procs windfury which can be quite good
[1:52:43] Kreynz: has blizzard released what the new runes will be?
[1:52:51] Sinostra: you already have a warrior
[1:52:59] HeyImArty: is Ryan poor on SoD, rough times
[1:53:17] HeyImArty: Man made a bank alt in Undercity
[1:53:19] HeyImArty: absolute amature
[1:53:24] JonaDefty: lmao
[1:53:50] maxmystixx767: yo @Hydramist good to know that my favourite dnb mix is on your stream haha the #60 one
[1:53:53] HeyImArty: Thunderbluff is like 2x closer
[1:54:09] Kreynz: what will be the horde buff city in phase 2 do u think
[1:54:13] reggieface420: embrace thunderbluff
[1:54:13] Kreynz: for alliance it's obviously ironforge
[1:54:17] eXTreMe1337: but uc is darkmode
[1:54:39] eXTreMe1337: no sunlight bis
[1:54:42] Slaanesh74: TB also gets a movement speed buff all the time
[1:54:50] maxmystixx767: ah damn the 107 haha ye the 60 has kind of same cover theyre both my fdacourite mixes hahahaha
[1:54:54] the_moist_factory: do you have a list of all the quest you prefarmed for phase 2?
[1:55:09] HeyImArty: more range
[1:55:11] HeyImArty: rage*
[1:55:55] reggieface420: berserker stance at 30 is
[1:56:00] reggieface420: kinda good
[1:56:18] reggieface420: intercept
[1:56:25] JonaDefty: its missing intercept cause you get it from berserker stance q
[1:56:36] HeyImArty: 30, and it also gives you Intercept
[1:56:39] massesto: B stance is 30
[1:56:54] rns_aurelius: its from a quest thats probably why its not there
[1:57:09] massesto: yes
[1:57:10] HeyImArty: Execute hits rly hard at 40
[1:57:14] HeyImArty: like, really hard
[1:57:15] massesto: execute is huge
[1:57:28] reggieface420: yeah execute does like 450 dmg with 10 rage at 40
[1:57:30] massesto: u rarely use rend unless dueling a rogue
[1:57:39] reggieface420: it hurts
[1:57:48] dills85: wonder if slam is going to be viable now
[1:58:02] HeyImArty: instant cast slam rune lmao
[1:58:09] massesto: slam slaps, but it's hard to use sadly
[1:58:16] dills85: with timing slam can do crazy burst but its so situational
[1:58:27] Kreynz: I hope they give warriors taste for blood + unrelenting assault as a rune
[1:58:28] HeyImArty: yes, you have to wave it
[1:58:28] massesto: correct
[1:58:31] HeyImArty: weave*
[1:58:50] HeyImArty: it costs rage which would go into WW/MS
[1:58:51] HeyImArty: so eh
[1:59:14] reggieface420: u would just use quick strike if u  had insane amounts of rage probably instead of slamming
[1:59:26] reggieface420: slam is kinda clunky
[1:59:30] massesto: warriors are just gonna be super good in pve now with bt
[1:59:37] massesto: pvp we are finally useful for MS
[1:59:57] Kreynz: is wound poison in classic like it was in tbc? stacks up to 5 with 10% ms per stack?
[2:00:05] reggieface420: its numerical kreynz
[2:00:09] reggieface420: not %
[2:00:09] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[2:00:19] reggieface420: so if u get poisoned the next heal heals you for like -46 or something
[2:00:25] massesto: yeah
[2:00:27] Kreynz: oh wtf
[2:00:31] HeyImArty: Unbirdled wrath is ass
[2:00:31] massesto: that talent sucks
[2:00:32] Kreynz: so wound poison isn't a real ms effect in classic
[2:00:37] HeyImArty: it's complete ass
[2:00:38] Kreynz: only warriors have it hten
[2:00:45] EX_Skenn: it's really bad yes
[2:00:56] EX_Skenn: for pvp you go with the shout range
[2:01:01] reggieface420: it depends on the heal they are getting healed by
[2:01:06] reggieface420: it scales off of cast speeds i think
[2:01:24] reggieface420: or maybe because its just a flat reduction its worse against slow cast speed heals
[2:01:29] Kreynz: is it like negative spell power?
[2:01:32] massesto: blood craze is giga good
[2:01:43] HeyImArty: 1.5
[2:01:46] HeyImArty: 1s with 5 talents LMAO
[2:01:53] massesto: issue is u dont have the 15 rage
[2:02:20] reggieface420: i remember in early classic there was a way to make slam good with some bug that got fixed
[2:02:22] HeyImArty: you dont go imp execute prolly
[2:02:23] fakemejo: guys is 2g for rfc boost a rip off?
[2:02:33] Kreynz: ah yer so wound poison is like negative +healing on that target... thats so weird lol
[2:03:04] QuickfireDouble: yes
[2:03:06] HeyImArty: it's a thing but why aren't you arms MS then
[2:03:08] massesto: it can be good
[2:03:08] reggieface420: cant really pvp without ms
[2:03:16] massesto: depending on the 2 hander u get
[2:03:25] massesto: but you will always go arms for pvp
[2:03:32] HeyImArty: fury 2h technically ok with a faster weapon because BT is AP not weapon dmg
[2:03:33] massesto: MS is just way too good and the dmg on it is just insane
[2:03:35] HeyImArty: but like, juts spec Arms
[2:03:57] HeyImArty: imagine if it was TBC & Death Wish was arms
[2:04:09] Pentextherealz: howl
[2:04:11] massesto: pendulum of doom with MS hits so fucking hard it'll make u puke
[2:04:12] DarianaTW: 2hander fury can do something with 2hander rune's
[2:04:16] Kreynz: are warriors like raid bosses like in tbc where if they have 5 seconds of uptime you die?
[2:04:18] DarianaTW: but will see
[2:04:42] reggieface420: the prot tree is cooked
[2:04:45] GIRTH_TV: i just dont get blizzard SOD choices for warrior. how do they give the best class all of the best runes
[2:05:01] massesto: just skip prot hydra
[2:05:05] massesto: its so cooked
[2:05:18] QuickfireDouble: gotta use a shield w/ devastate
[2:05:45] reggieface420: u cant get any rage
[2:05:57] massesto: You get negative rage in prot
[2:06:00] massesto: its disgusting
[2:06:07] HeyImArty: Ryans mic arm sounds sketchy
[2:06:29] reggieface420: getting hit to build rage is weird
[2:06:35] reggieface420: its the same formula from 1-60 i think
[2:06:41] reggieface420: so u dont build for shit
[2:06:43] reggieface420: at low levels
[2:06:54] horvat007: priest is hopefully gonna be fun still
[2:06:56] massesto: Higher white hits = more rage
[2:07:00] horvat007: at least I hope so
[2:07:08] massesto: going prot u sacrifice so much weapon dmg its just troll
[2:07:18] massesto: last stand is the only good thing from prot
[2:08:32] massesto: Warlock
[2:08:36] massesto: Warlock is gonna cook
[2:08:38] boxxyhaha: warlock

[2:13:39] FIREMAGZZ: I hope they stay the course and just buff hunter priest and druid.
[2:13:40] massesto: rippppp
[2:13:45] Sinostra: spellstone won't be used imo
[2:13:50] Sinostra: never gets

[2:15:09] rotbodi: next phase so goood
[2:15:11] Ignz7: !newvid
[2:15:11] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT8n61Bgc60

[2:15:22] Sinostra: talents would be this
[2:15:26] Sinostra: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/0500253012201145

[2:16:00] the_moist_factory: idk about exhuast
[2:16:10] Sinostra: yeah dark pact is useeless
[2:16:18] the_moist_factory: SUPRESSION
[2:16:18] Zelimeth: need supression surely
[2:16:20] Zelimeth: for the hit?
[2:16:24] Zelimeth: 5/5 must?
[2:16:27] the_moist_factory: supression is better than exhaust
[2:16:32] Sinostra: depends on the gear
[2:16:33] massesto: you could put points in demonic for extra hp
[2:16:34] Sinostra: but yeah
[2:16:38] Sinostra: you can add supression
[2:16:45] massesto: instead of all the coex points
[2:16:54] SoMoistv: 1 on exhaustion is enough imo
[2:16:56] JonaDefty: snutz was saying surpression works vs shadow resist too
[2:16:58] alboro1: Milord Hydra, will you share that lovely spreadsheet?
[2:17:06] Sinostra: @massesto that's very meh
[2:17:12] the_moist_factory: its 40% with other talents
[2:17:13] the_moist_factory: its not good
[2:17:20] Sinostra: yeah 10% is bad, hence why i'm going 30%
[2:18:06] SoMoistv: supression is 1% per talent, not 2% even tho it says so
[2:19:09] JonaDefty: i know snutz is going 5/5 on it
[2:19:24] Zelimeth: yeah i got it from a snutz thing too
[2:19:32] the_moist_factory: but isnt resist different from hit>?
[2:20:29] Zelimeth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfP8XEUybYo&t=66s&ab_channel=Snutz 1m 6s
[2:22:01] MVPeteTV: do we know how many points we need in shadow focus at 40?
[2:23:06] the_moist_factory: im pretty sure this is how the talents are suppose to work for lock at 40
[2:23:08] the_moist_factory: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/5500253012201005
[2:23:50] varatupaj: snutz is playing 5/5 sup
[2:23:51] massesto: dont priest get shadow prot this coming phase?
[2:23:56] massesto: or is it later
[2:24:03] the_moist_factory: 10% movement is it worth though?
[2:24:11] Sinostra: @the_moist_factory nah, you need more
[2:24:11] the_moist_factory: i mean if melee is already on you whats the point?
[2:24:13] massesto: I think u go 2/4 in imp coex
[2:24:20] massesto: 4/4 seems meh
[2:24:55] opti90: song name?
[2:25:52] Kreynz: do you think it's weird that penance can crit even tho channels usually in classic can't crit
[2:25:55] Kreynz: like mage regen can't crit
[2:26:13] fakemejo: im levling a troll just for shadow next phase
[2:26:13] HeyImArty: would not call Blackout wiggleroom
[2:26:18] HeyImArty: Blackout is too good
[2:26:27] the_moist_factory: i mean if you go 5/5 shadow focus then 5/5 supression same thing?
[2:26:37] Kreynz: ye but penance doesn't enter the game til wrath and everything can crit in wrath anyway
[2:26:50] Zelimeth: i'd rather go 5/5 supression to be safe :D
[2:27:12] fiskensfriend: @
[2:27:24] Sinostra: also, do we get a new spellpen trinket ?
[2:27:27] Sinostra: at level 40
[2:27:31] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist then u have 20 MP from WSG trinkit at 40
[2:27:36] fiskensfriend: to counter
[2:27:36] Zelimeth: until we know the new loot, ppl will be using pearl for sure

[2:27:58] xoHaptix: @Sinostra yes
[2:28:04] HeyImArty: is resistance still bugged vs dot dmg in SoD
[2:28:19] xoHaptix: @HeyImArty psure
[2:28:51] MVPeteTV: i think next raid will give res for something else than shadow, probably somehting that corresponds with the raid
[2:29:14] Vazcoll: Will there be a disc\holy build that priest can run for open world pvp?
[2:29:21] Zelimeth: i reckon nature res
[2:29:29] HeyImArty: nature res inc from gnomer
[2:29:30] xoHaptix: prob nature res
[2:29:33] JonaDefty: nature res can fuck off  i wanna play ele
[2:29:38] Drunk_Mantis: i think gnomer will be fire and arcane, maybe some nature
[2:29:48] Zelimeth: bfa all over again
[2:29:49] reggieface420: i suspect we'll get nature res
[2:29:52] MVPeteTV: dont think it was before but it is now
[2:29:56] Zelimeth: corruption on gear returning
[2:29:57] HeyImArty: void made sense for BFD if you know the lore
[2:29:59] rns_aurelius: It was always twilight so it makes sense to make it shadow
[2:30:00] xoHaptix: just praying for epic engi goggles
[2:30:01] HeyImArty: void doesnt make sense for gnomer
[2:30:04] Zbile: yep, preparing us for the new big void expansion...or 3 of them
[2:30:16] MVPeteTV: im guessing nature for gnomer
[2:30:28] HeyImArty: Gnomer nature/fire makes the most sense
[2:30:34] HeyImArty: if they wanna keep it thematic/lore relevant
[2:31:04] Sinostra: @HeyImArty they definetely will
[2:31:08] sheephill: fire makes sense with the bombs and stuff
[2:31:24] HeyImArty: if they are good they'll swap to shadow res aura
[2:31:27] sheephill: I think 3 points is the play tbh
[2:32:19] HeyImArty: im sure there will be some spell hit items aswell in the raid
[2:32:59] reggieface420: are you wearing 1% hit boots always tho
[2:32:59] rns_aurelius: how much does demon armour give? couldnt a lock benefit from all 3
[2:33:02] reggieface420: idk exactly
[2:33:11] reggieface420: oh right it wouldnt matter at all
[2:33:42] vertebreakergaming: Was pirest fear not physical in vanilla? Could of sworn it was which is why it cant be dispelled.
[2:33:43] krit23k: GalaxyUnpacked copyThis TinyFace
[2:34:10] vertebreakergaming: got it thanks
[2:34:38] Droczid: !newvid

[2:34:41] sheephill: doesnt work
[2:34:42] reggieface420: u cant
[2:34:54] JonaDefty: bop it
[2:34:58] sheephill: worked on some private server but not in classic
[2:34:58] JonaDefty: twist it
[2:35:01] HeyImArty: it's just a randomly undispellable fear for no fucking reason
[2:35:03] Zd_90: any Wsg premade ?horde :)
[2:35:06] the_moist_factory: pull ity
[2:35:06] HeyImArty: spaghetti was cooking that day on the job
[2:35:29] eXTreMe1337: oh lol and i tried to dispel in pvp
[2:35:36] Zelimeth: does r2 go to magic at all? :D
[2:35:38] the_moist_factory: thats why undead is king racial
[2:35:54] Sinostra: you can skip demo on this one
[2:36:10] Zelimeth: rank 2 fear if it does more mobs, do they change it to a mgical debuff - prob not
[2:36:15] Sinostra: no
[2:36:18] the_moist_factory: losing insta corruption
[2:36:19] DarianaTW: no
[2:36:20] the_moist_factory: its rough
[2:36:20] Sinostra: no one's plaaying demo in pvp
[2:36:29] Mystylerocks: it will happen lads, but it will be some meta melee only pvp
[2:36:32] Sinostra: demo doesn't help your damage
[2:36:44] Zelimeth: felguard rune ionc
[2:36:45] Zelimeth: inc
[2:36:53] Mystylerocks: fel int
[2:36:58] reggieface420: i feel like dot specs are in a weird place because multi dotting only makes pom bounce more
[2:37:04] reggieface420: in group pvp
[2:37:08] Sinostra: you have a grand total of 0 damage increase
[2:37:50] Mystylerocks: yah so bad for so deep in the tree :D
[2:37:53] HeyImArty: Imp Spellstone existing is such a meme
[2:38:18] the_moist_factory: level 50 is better for locks
[2:38:19] Kenny_Marsh: you and your pet*
[2:38:24] HeyImArty: its you and pet
[2:38:25] maximoum91: You and the pet
[2:38:25] HeyImArty: not just pet
[2:38:38] rns_aurelius: 40 resist from master demonoligist, 30 from priest buff and 45 from shadow res aura
[2:38:40] Sinostra: Felhunter's base resist is pretty high
[2:38:50] Sinostra: pet's gonna resist a lot
[2:39:30] HeyImArty: Fel Hunter has base 120 resist at 60, should be baseline 2 per 1 level
[2:39:46] Sinostra: sad thing is, suppression doesn't seem to apply to haunt
[2:40:01] HeyImArty: Banishing Felhunter in lock mirrors is insane, you have to CoE them
[2:40:06] Sinostra: yeah
[2:40:08] Sinostra: sasdg
[2:40:10] Sinostra: sadge

[2:40:34] reggieface420: i wonder if u can ever play affliction with pom in the game
[2:40:50] Mystylerocks: will be fun to see destro PvP , hoping for a lil Shadowfury rune ofc?
[2:40:51] reggieface420: chaos bolt seems fun
[2:41:21] Sinostra: that's the point
[2:41:26] HeyImArty: "Felhunters have innate magic resistance, equal to twice its master's level."
[2:41:28] Sinostra: gimme wrath shadowfury please
[2:41:30] HeyImArty: double checked to be sure
[2:41:43] LostOrbitt: yo
[2:41:48] JonaDefty: i would give them 70% shadowflame snare and reduce the range on the drain rune
[2:41:52] Noilane: im expecting some shadow runes following all the fire ones
[2:42:00] Mystylerocks: yea cast time if it stuns normally or only ministuns and instant
[2:42:12] reggieface420: tbc shadowfury has a short cast time but there's not too many tbc abilities in sod, most stuff is wotlk
[2:42:25] Mystylerocks: idk can u imagine a meta soul link warlock dying to any melee in pvp?
[2:42:37] Mystylerocks: they will just run around agony, life drain with rune and spam searing
[2:42:58] reggieface420: meta is weaker vs other casters which ppl are scared of at 40 already
[2:43:09] Sinostra: why wouldn't you go master channeler ?
[2:43:32] AdamNicholsMusic: cant wait for SL
[2:43:32] Sinostra: chest rune
[2:43:33] Noilane: chest rune
[2:43:35] rns_aurelius: its the sucky sucky rune
[2:43:35] the_moist_factory: wrong drain life
[2:44:06] rns_aurelius: if soul siphon was on legs it might be usable
[2:44:19] laptopgamerx69: hey hydra new viewer here just wanted to get your thoughts on ziqo as a human being
[2:44:37] prodxx_: !Runes
[2:44:38] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[2:44:40] reggieface420: i think ur good vs things that can't heal themselves
[2:44:45] reggieface420: and basically useless otherwise
[2:44:49] chickenburgah: hey
[2:44:52] chickenburgah: LORD BOXXY HERE
[2:45:46] svettsune: ey bois
[2:46:06] Sickslol: soul link will still do a ton of damage with incinerate rune & haunt lol
[2:46:08] Zelimeth: dont think so
[2:46:10] Mystylerocks: agony is so meh
[2:46:16] HeyImArty: imp agony is 1 of your flex slots
[2:46:16] Sinostra: still more damage
[2:46:19] notJumu: imp life tap
[2:46:19] Zelimeth: prob tongues or exhausting
[2:46:21] Zelimeth: more of the time
[2:46:22] thatragingarab: how come u didnt add mortal strike to warrior?
[2:46:24] the_moist_factory: img agony vs exhaust lol
[2:46:24] Zelimeth: life tap bis
[2:46:24] HeyImArty: you can use them for anything else & not bad
[2:46:31] notJumu: get imp life tap
[2:46:58] Mystylerocks: might as well imp mana
[2:47:06] thatragingarab: oh my bad
[2:47:12] HeyImArty: man added MS to warrior before he even opened the talent calc
[2:47:38] Zelimeth: more range, siphon life for the DL protection
[2:47:46] Sinostra: you have double extra drain life + siphon
[2:48:04] Zelimeth: immolate too maybe
[2:48:08] eXTreMe1337: extra dot which benefits from haunt rune
[2:48:10] Noilane: nf procs out the ass with drain and corr always up
[2:48:16] reggieface420: UA?
[2:48:18] Sinostra: now imagine adding UA on top of that
[2:48:19] reggieface420: oh
[2:48:22] reggieface420: shadow's embrace
[2:48:23] reggieface420: is what u mean
[2:49:01] Zelimeth: i'd take 1 pt out of imp exh for the final talent
[2:49:04] Zelimeth: for that on demand mana if needed
[2:49:10] reggieface420: yea shadow's embrace worked kinda like winter's chill where u could technically dispel their debuffs, just you'd fail half the time
[2:49:18] Sinostra: @Zelimeth you got tap
[2:49:25] Zelimeth: without losing hp
[2:49:28] Sinostra: no need for 2 mana spells
[2:49:50] Zelimeth: i guess its preference but i'd go for it
[2:49:57] Zelimeth: might be a situation where u cant tap
[2:49:57] Sinostra: yeah, it is
[2:50:07] Mystylerocks: depends what u do with them i  take it
[2:50:10] HeyImArty: feldoggo doesnt go oom
[2:50:10] Sinostra: yeah, you risk ooming your pet
[2:50:13] Zelimeth: if felhunter devours it gets mana back right?
[2:50:14] Mystylerocks: like if u have auto cast on spells
[2:50:18] HeyImArty: but if you pact it does go oom
[2:50:21] Skipiz852: are you making a new video ?
[2:50:25] Mystylerocks: he gets hp back when devouring
[2:50:29] Mystylerocks: i dont remember mana
[2:50:29] AdamNicholsMusic: the only one that goes oom is imp lol
[2:50:33] Sinostra: it gets health back
[2:50:38] HeyImArty: Devour heals in classic
[2:50:40] Sinostra: i don't think mana
[2:50:41] HeyImArty: doesnt give mana
[2:51:15] HeyImArty: It doesnt, you cant pact
[2:51:20] HeyImArty: if you pact your doggo will be sad
[2:51:20] Mystylerocks: it doesnt :D
[2:51:41] Sinostra: also can't cs without mana
[2:51:50] anderswhk: $10 for the mental time youre putting into this shit is nothing lol

[2:53:32] HeyImArty: wth is a youtube member subscription
[2:54:05] Mystylerocks: fel dom too
[2:54:29] misstherese: hello
[2:54:32] anderswhk: @HeyImArty supporting the content creator, no idea how it actually works. No ads i guess which is viable since YouTube is now fucking you for using ad block lol
[2:54:40] Zelimeth: i wasnt sure if the column is highlighting new things 25-40 or overall benefits of the spec
[2:54:44] Sinostra: Demo isn't gonna be played
[2:54:49] Sinostra: unless crazy runes
[2:55:32] tpleym: does the new runes at 40 go on other gear?
[2:55:58] Sinostra: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/warlock/--0550005122005141
[2:56:03] Sinostra: my take on destro
[2:56:05] Mystylerocks: if u play fire lock u skip
[2:56:09] anderswhk: havent actually played SoD or WoW since it came out, work shit. Is SoD fun or is it kind of meh?
[2:56:10] Zelimeth: incinerate prob to buff that CB
[2:56:34] bassiemon123: Ur wsg video did pritty good right? How about making a AB one, might be 1 of few.
[2:56:37] eXTreMe1337: u can get yt premium for like 1dollar with a vpn set to india, ukraine, turkey or whatever (depends on your county and creditcard)
[2:56:38] tpleym: damn, going to struggle with binds
[2:57:15] AdamNicholsMusic: no
[2:57:17] Quentey: no
[2:57:18] luzid7: chaos is fire
[2:57:24] Sinostra: nope, doesn't
[2:57:36] Zelimeth: dont get soulfire until like 50 tho
[2:57:37] Zelimeth: right
[2:57:57] AdamNicholsMusic: i cant wait to seduce then blast
[2:58:12] Sinostra: eh, i'd still go felhunter
[2:58:20] Sinostra: magic dispel and cs is too much value
[2:58:36] Sinostra: and randies always break your seduce in bg anyways
[2:59:20] Sinostra: problem is, you have no instants
[2:59:29] Sinostra: how do you not get csed ?
[2:59:29] cockjab: rogues gonna be running rampant so seduction would def be useful
[2:59:46] anderswhk: is hydra going to play lock, or is he just making strats to duel them?
[3:00:04] Mystylerocks: reviewing and rating all specs / classes
[3:00:19] bayernmunchen90: meta is overrated in pvp
[3:00:22] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[3:01:34] tpleym: they have pet atlest
[3:01:51] Sinostra: really depends on the runes
[3:02:06] Sinostra: what made it great was shadowfury/haste proc
[3:02:19] Sinostra: and a 100% snare on conflag
[3:02:20] anderswhk: arent deep demo going to be ridiculous no matter what? I havent played sod
[3:02:50] Zelimeth: destro is a bit setup based
[3:03:23] nikko669: when is Phase 2 ?
[3:03:34] Mystylerocks: feb 8th
[3:03:40] tpleym: destro has big potential for bg
[3:03:41] nikko669: thx
[3:03:52] HeyImArty: no Death Coil at 40 is painful
[3:04:33] wowjunkie94: Bolt conflag Shadowburn for prob like 2k dmg
[3:04:46] the_moist_factory: i wonder how reflective enginerring will work vs mages
[3:05:09] the_moist_factory: like living flame
[3:05:31] the_moist_factory: will it reflect the spell entirely or just the dmg
[3:06:19] tpleym: livingf flame is shit anyways
[3:06:28] Toxiferous: Taste the flames of Sulfuron
[3:06:34] Mystylerocks: little lickah for us
[3:07:00] fakemejo: some1 has gotten farmed by living flame
[3:07:03] Solarqq: !song
[3:07:15] sulltan95: @hydramist can u show the ones u did
[3:07:22] fattyjuicer: ur shoulders look so sick
[3:07:31] KeevK26: wanna go for rogue next?
[3:08:56] Zelimeth: it's good research tho
[3:08:56] staun: Also very interesting!
[3:09:13] causemosmvp: I hope you skipped paladins since they will be useless anyway
[3:09:14] jgarcia95az: mage
[3:09:15] Zelimeth: sub all the way
[3:09:23] DarianaTW: assa all the wau
[3:09:24] DarianaTW: way
[3:09:24] Zelimeth: prep is bis
[3:09:29] Danimal_Media: what we doin?
[3:09:35] Mystylerocks: some prep mix for sure, too strong
[3:09:41] cockjab: prep for double blind surely
[3:09:44] staun: Done mage already?
[3:10:54] Danimal_Media: ele will be scary af
[3:10:57] Veekayx: hows feral druid looking mate
[3:11:17] cockjab: im so excited for shadow
[3:11:32] fakemejo: i agree, got to lvl 12 and quit =)
[3:12:17] nerkklal: @Hydramist What do u think about ret lvl 40? s tier?
[3:12:27] cockjab: i hope we get dual spec at 40
[3:12:36] Danimal_Media: buzzin
[3:12:42] Mzin8: is this pve or pvp tier list
[3:12:44] DarianaTW: all cc's
[3:12:46] Mzin8: or both
[3:12:47] fattyjuicer: whats this spellbook addon
[3:13:02] cockjab: kidney and blind
[3:13:06] Mystylerocks: Whats Training @fattyjuicer
[3:13:28] fattyjuicer: ty
[3:13:59] Mistolin_: good against priests
[3:14:06] Danimal_Media: @Mzin8 pvp mostly
[3:14:33] DarianaTW: assa i think or sub
[3:14:38] staun: Does Ele has anything to reduce pushback?
[3:14:48] DarianaTW: assa will be so strong now with poisons increase
[3:14:48] cockjab: hemo prob wont be worth dmg compared to 40 energy backstabs with slaughter rune
[3:15:32] cockjab: but you have your control abilites now so mobility isnt as important imo
[3:15:44] cockjab: you can lock down and burst much easier
[3:16:07] Kreynz: will rogues still use quick draw if they have kidney? Is there a good alternative rune option there?
[3:16:38] alboro1: safe fall @Hydramist
[3:16:56] Murixtv: @kreynz could be useful since it’s ranged,  but probably not as good as it is now
[3:17:00] cockjab: sub with hemo uses evis
[3:17:02] Danimal_Media: none with saber?
[3:17:04] the_moist_factory: saber slash just better
[3:17:47] cockjab: expose isnt worth at 40 imo
[3:18:03] Danimal_Media: they get vigor?
[3:18:10] Danimal_Media: assa
[3:18:32] Danimal_Media: muti oculd go hard with vigor
[3:18:47] cockjab: i think you gotta go for prep at 40
[3:18:51] Addiox: ye many specs
[3:18:56] cockjab: double blind is just too good
[3:19:02] fakemejo: i would give perp a msg
[3:19:05] DarianaTW: assa full poisons and bleed....will hurt everything
[3:19:18] Danimal_Media: ye can't see not being sub atm
[3:19:30] DarianaTW: no envenom, stun
[3:19:37] Danimal_Media: yeah muti envenom and deadly brew?
[3:19:56] Amerish88: Just tuned in, has he placed priest yet?
[3:20:00] ama__deus: What are we theorycrafting on?
[3:20:01] cockjab: all 3 trees have useful talents for any pvp spec you usually pick from each
[3:20:13] Danimal_Media: muti needs poison for more damage no? I am out of touch with rogue
[3:20:21] eXTreMe1337: maybe mix speccs and not go for 40 talent?
[3:20:44] rns_aurelius: deadly brew will mean your crippling/would will also apply deadly poison
[3:20:48] Danimal_Media: prep will defo be bis for wpvp surely
[3:20:49] cockjab: 40 talent def not worth ever in pvp imo
[3:21:03] Skipiz852: can u go imp. backstab and prep at 40 or not enough points ?
[3:21:22] DarianaTW: that is pve stuff
[3:21:24] kottessontv: hi hydra

[3:21:44] DarianaTW: no
[3:21:51] Danimal_Media: not in pvp i think
[3:21:54] ama__deus: Isn't having a DOT passively applied kinda shit for a rogue in PVP? FeelsDankMan
[3:21:57] mysst23: have you done mage prediction?
[3:22:02] Addiox: not in pvp
[3:22:04] hobobob000: oh god
[3:22:28] Xadriell: yeah that seems fine
[3:22:30] xaar94: without knowledge about the new runes this tierlist is atm worthless
[3:22:34] hobobob000: ra is underrated imo
[3:23:20] ama__deus: Won't shadow still have massive mana issues?
[3:23:26] devoedm8: this bit pve or pvp?
[3:23:31] fakemejo: pvp
[3:23:55] ama__deus: Priest seems like such a safe bet to play moving forward
[3:23:55] DarianaTW: yea
[3:24:01] cockjab: i never like seal fate
[3:24:02] rns_aurelius: pallys druids and shamans have been given runes to address mana issues i assume priests will get one too
[3:24:59] hobobob000: if this is pvp wouldn't prep builds be stronger? or we cookin up an assass build rn?
[3:25:20] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[3:25:21] Amerish88: Is there a link to that googledoc yet?
[3:25:53] ama__deus: Link to the video will be just fine when it's out
[3:26:03] Amerish88: no worries
[3:26:03] ama__deus: and, you know, monetized EZ
[3:26:29] cockjab: ya i wouldnt use a pure assa build
[3:26:32] ama__deus: Did you do feral already?
[3:27:05] alboro1: improved sap @Hydramist
[3:27:39] cockjab: imp sap is sub
[3:27:58] alboro1: can't pvp without that talent
[3:28:21] mynutsz: s
[3:28:22] AlphaRavenQT: What is the server ?
[3:30:20] ama__deus: In the last 5 minutes, I saw 3 variations of Hydra or Hydramist char names on Crusader Strike EU KEKW Guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
[3:30:59] ExamanteD: Preach
[3:31:01] cockjab: id use something like this for dagger sub (prep, imp sap, 20 energy cs) https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/rogue/-3203-05024303030012_156v976hna6j0
[3:31:06] jijlol: surely rogues getting shadowstep
[3:31:23] ama__deus: @jijlol wouldn't count on it, now that they have that pseudo step
[3:31:35] ama__deus: Blizz seems cautious about mobility abilities in general for SOD
[3:32:00] tpleym: gouge?
[3:32:03] Ellusi0n: no hemo?
[3:32:47] cockjab: ya 40 energy backstab much more dmg than 35 hemo
[3:32:56] Danimal_Media: dont need if BS
[3:33:08] Danimal_Media: shiv?
[3:33:32] ama__deus: Does between the eyes share CD with KS?
[3:33:45] ama__deus: probably at least DR, so yeah, likely useless to double dip there
[3:33:56] cockjab: ya it does
[3:33:58] tpleym: yes
[3:33:58] slug_22: IT DOES
[3:34:02] fakemejo: imagine how broken if not
[3:34:30] xDropperd: Ranged Stun/kick is kinda nice though
[3:34:31] BiggieBoyZ: might come some more ranged stuff idk
[3:34:50] Danimal_Media: was that instad of envenom?
[3:34:51] fitzgeraldn: between the ayes is ranged though
[3:35:09] sulltan95: @hydramist BTE is way better than kidney , it does huge dmg and it is ranged
[3:35:09] Wickk77: man im really afraid that spriest will be dogsh!t
[3:35:17] Murixtv: between the eyes and pistol shot will keep you from getting kited in some situations
[3:35:22] Danimal_Media: envenom is good vs plate probs
[3:35:29] ama__deus: Feel like BtE will mostly be a duelling rune, but could be wrong
[3:35:42] AlphaRavenQT: any1 know server name ?
[3:35:55] Impax101: Hey
[3:35:57] cockjab: yup
[3:35:59] BiggieBoyZ: KEKW
[3:36:02] tpleym: yep
[3:36:21] Danimal_Media: I think it depends on if they get a rune that allows combos to be self recorded and not target
[3:36:21] jijlol: RIP SAP
[3:36:52] ExamanteD: Yeah
[3:37:10] Danimal_Media: if combos can be on any target and can swap targets with full combos, BTE will be awesome
[3:37:16] cockjab: if pvp trinkets werent out yet id say sub is S but rogues gonna be forced to blind trinkets
[3:37:26] Murixtv: is this pve or pvp tier list
[3:37:31] Rusk1turbooo: Without runes, in the classic beta, many rogues were playing Hemo Mace build
[3:37:38] Rusk1turbooo: at 49
[3:37:40] Rusk1turbooo: 40*
[3:38:10] jijlol: any news on shadowdance

[3:41:22] cockjab: missing imp sprint
[3:41:24] ExamanteD: Yep combat will be terrible for pvp but seems great for pve
[3:41:40] dreeeamyy: Cant wait for Beastial Wrath and all the 10483729 nerfs its gonna get
[3:41:42] ama__deus: I am dying to play shadow, but kinda doubtful it will slap Sadge

[3:50:32] ziad_nasr: but viper is with no cd in vanilla isn’t it?
[3:50:33] lawnmoving: Hey Hydra! Question about wotkl as disc mage vs druid warrior - what do you think should be the right strat?

[3:59:35] Kiwifruits: watch them get trap launcher lol
[4:00:12] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[4:00:23] TopRinser: surv really good against 1v1 melee
[4:00:25] kleptomaggs: BM with full stam build, let pet solo
[4:00:33] TheZtiff: give us the shaman :D
[4:00:38] dreeeamyy: If nothing charges and runes are ”bad” BM tree is just way too good
[4:00:47] Inzio: @Hydramist vods wont load for me what did you tier ret pal?
[4:00:59] dreeeamyy: everyone will be Bm
[4:01:21] ama__deus: Curious about mage, seeing how they're right now
[4:01:24] mjolnirson: sharing this?
[4:01:34] ama__deus: This might be the first time mages aren't top dog at 25 LUL
[4:01:37] uceyjuicyxix88: how do you move nugkeyfeedback bro ? and engineering still top tier profession ? used this time LW for void gloves on rogue
[4:02:10] reach27: mages are top dog for botting gold KEKW
[4:02:49] v1betr1b3: dont do CoC
[4:02:57] kleptomaggs: the only new spells mages get from 25 to 40 are mana agate and cone of cold, everything else is a rank up (unless its a talent)
[4:02:57] peetca: go arcane
[4:02:59] tpleym: CoC is 34
[4:03:08] ama__deus: what do you mean how hard it is to cast?
[4:03:23] L0opito: usually you take points for precision from frostbite
[4:03:36] staun: @kleptomaggs what about block, shield
[4:03:52] kleptomaggs: @staun those are talents
[4:04:02] staun: @kleptomaggs lmao. i realised when i re-read
[4:04:09] dreeeamyy: just wanna say ive really been vibin to the chill dnb lately
[4:04:12] dreeeamyy: i like it alot
[4:04:33] v1betr1b3: frost channeling is kinda important
[4:04:38] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist the thing with cone is that u use it most of the time when have shatter combo ready. So its not a 35% increase its a 70%
[4:04:40] L0opito: rarely take chill it's when heavy focused on peeling (stack for sheep dispel)
[4:04:41] ama__deus: feel like at some point freezing fingers + ice lanec has to come online for frost mages
[4:04:43] reach27: mana gem :)
[4:04:58] fakemejo: as frost? doubt
[4:04:59] v1betr1b3: drinking blows
[4:05:11] L0opito: cone 2/3 is "best" value
[4:05:23] kleptomaggs: winters chill > cone every time
[4:05:24] reach27: arcane might be the play for pve atleast depending on runes
[4:05:34] L0opito: oh ye 1 mb
[4:06:29] BiggieBoyZ: winters chill more of arena talent tbh
[4:06:34] kleptomaggs: ice lance does triple damage vs frozen targets so crits are going to be very important
[4:07:23] L0opito: i'd drop frostbite and blizz for 2/3 one
[4:07:28] BiggieBoyZ: not worth
[4:07:28] L0opito: 2/3 frostbite
[4:07:51] v1betr1b3: with shatter we've got alot of crit anyway
[4:07:52] Sinostra: is imp blizzard really that important ?
[4:07:52] reach27: what is rank of frostbolt?
[4:07:59] v1betr1b3: dont think WC is that good, maybe just 1 for dispels
[4:08:05] eXTreMe1337: permafrost so op fo rank1 frostbolt
[4:08:06] reach27: not bad
[4:08:22] kleptomaggs: mana agate
[4:08:25] kleptomaggs: huge
[4:08:26] TopRinser: @Sinostra im gonna use it 3/3 just because its hella annoying probs wont take shatter
[4:08:29] L0opito: no
[4:08:30] BiggieBoyZ: no
[4:08:33] Shad_WW: No
[4:08:36] L0opito: you always use r1
[4:08:37] Shad_WW: you always use r1 nova
[4:08:38] L0opito: ye
[4:08:45] dreeeamyy: no think its the same
[4:08:58] kleptomaggs: cone of cold
[4:09:19] kleptomaggs: its new tho, nobody has cone rn
[4:09:35] eXTreMe1337: dmg of higher nova rank not worth the extra manacost
[4:09:37] guidelock: GIGACHAD we at the bis class
[4:09:44] reach27: fire gets kinda screwed because lvl 42 for next rank of fireball
[4:09:52] dreeeamyy: lvl 38 arcane explosion is gonna be juicy

[4:11:01] BiggieBoyZ: gonna sell a stack of water for 2g
[4:11:31] BiggieBoyZ: 4 mana bars to make a stack
[4:11:54] L0opito: really really depends on rune
[4:12:05] L0opito: maybe blizz will put in some stupid stuff like dispel lmao
[4:12:09] jijlol: heard mages gettin deep
[4:12:17] v1betr1b3: icy veins get reset by snap
[4:12:17] L0opito: imagine
[4:12:19] Neverwind_: icy veins makes more sense in fire lol
[4:12:21] L0opito: deep freeze rofl
[4:12:24] guidelock: arcane will be S+ and i will oneshot you all with surge EZ
[4:12:26] BiggieBoyZ: no shot deep freeze comes back
[4:12:29] L0opito: it does
[4:12:31] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: are they introducing new runes into the existing slots or a new item slot?
[4:12:34] realScreaMy: icy veins is good bcs reset with snap
[4:12:35] Neverwind_: Yes it oes
[4:12:44] tpleym: icy veins, when on cd switch runes
[4:12:52] Kiwifruits: heard they are gettin magic dispel too with improved dispel curse or w/e
[4:12:54] kleptomaggs: arcane would be nutty for the one shot arcane surge build but it depends if it can one shot people after 1-2 arcane blasts (casted or POM)
[4:13:00] dreeeamyy: Mages always find a way to S tier i swear
[4:13:02] jijlol: ice barrier and deep cracker
[4:13:05] L0opito: god tier 1v1
[4:13:05] v1betr1b3: plus were getting Water Elemental, poggggzzz
[4:13:09] Sinostra: Demo Z tier
[4:13:30] L0opito: SL useless in BG but unkillable 1v1
[4:13:30] realScreaMy: if fire get hot streak rune would be A or S tier tho
[4:13:36] dreeeamyy: imagine fel guard rune NotLikeThis
[4:13:41] L0opito: Meta in BG means he can get bannished KEKW
[4:13:50] chagool1: Coldsnap for frost talents?
[4:13:57] L0opito: You can
[4:14:05] L0opito: It's a demon you can't sheep it
[4:14:08] ShirtOffTime: cant sap meta
[4:14:10] dreeeamyy: LUL
[4:14:13] ShirtOffTime: so you should be able to banish
[4:14:14] ama__deus: soul link feels like it'll get so much busted synergy out of this new drain life version
[4:14:21] Sinostra: loooool, if it's bannable, it's even worse
[4:14:58] eXTreMe1337: wast there items with insane attackpower againsr demons?
[4:15:08] ama__deus: Can you enslave meta warlocks? Kappa
[4:15:11] dreeeamyy: now that you say it, locks are gonna be aids
[4:15:13] Sinostra: also, when the pet is banned, it disables SL
[4:15:21] L0opito: Can't fear with meta tho it's a taunt but ye
[4:15:31] dreeeamyy: do locks get death coil aswell at 40?
[4:15:40] BiggieBoyZ: death coil 42 KEKW
[4:15:41] L0opito: Death coil is 42 iirc
[4:15:56] dreeeamyy: ahh some saving grace atleast

[4:17:54] fatlance: improved fire blast worth it
[4:17:57] dreeeamyy: just chillin
[4:17:59] Neverwind_: I still thing you use regen in chest for pvp
[4:18:04] reach27: fire might not be so good in pve though
[4:18:07] Neverwind_: Since living flame is relevant
[4:18:09] tpleym: hmm
[4:18:20] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: big dmg but these fire mages will die to 1 hunter multi
[4:18:47] reach27: get in the deadzone is only chance

[4:19:05] Neverwind_: clazzi on 60s
[4:19:05] tpleym: dragons breath inc
[4:19:10] Neverwind_: <3
[4:19:18] BiggieBoyZ: gief DB Pog
[4:19:45] ama__deus: I feel like the enlightenment mana reg could be dope for BG PVP somehow
[4:20:37] L0opito: Nah Master of Elements not rly worth it I think, Fire Power too good
[4:20:48] guidelock: the based spec is next KEKW
[4:20:50] Toxiferous: agreed
[4:21:24] Toxiferous: fire power > MoE
[4:21:37] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: would skip moe
[4:21:37] reach27: maybe some 1 shot arcane surges
[4:21:38] Neverwind_: Fire in PVE would go nuts!
[4:21:39] dezuslol: !talents
[4:21:39] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[4:21:41] L0opito: Ye scorch is pretty cheap tbh
[4:21:47] stalkerbronet: its pvp or pve tierlist? just tuned in
[4:21:47] Neverwind_: You heard it here first guys :>
[4:22:01] guidelock: THE ARCANE DREAM
[4:22:01] eXTreMe1337: blastwave has knockback, right? i'll live at sawmill in AB
[4:22:03] reach27: pom ab into surge
[4:22:11] L0opito: @eXTreMe1337 it doesn't in vanilla
[4:22:15] Tolleee: what is the spellbook addon called?
[4:22:35] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: @Neverwind_ they will be the best caster dps for sure, cant see them overtaking rogues ferals so maybe 4th best
[4:22:37] reach27: need a rune to give haste proc for missiles
[4:22:37] Fropsy: @Tolleee what's training?
[4:22:47] hamzaderkiller: will the list be public after you finished it ?
[4:22:51] perplexity: 220 raiders from perplexity have joined! 
[4:22:55] guidelock: u go absorb 100%
[4:23:01] Tolleee: @fropsy cheeres
[4:23:02] hamzaderkiller: nice
[4:23:13] Neverwind_: perpo :o
[4:23:15] taylor13xd: yo
[4:23:22] luzid7: arcane is so nice you can heal dps in raids, you can aoe farm and pvp
[4:24:23] Neverwind_: 100% arcane conce
[4:24:35] taylor13xd: arcane concentration is bis
[4:24:39] guidelock: monkaHmm
[4:24:53] luzid7: uh can you pump pyro? i think not right
[4:25:04] DisorderlyTV: I would grab imp mana shield
[4:25:09] L0opito: imp mana shield kind of a must, increases mana efficiency of it
[4:25:12] guidelock: we play POM Surge
[4:25:14] guidelock: EZ
[4:25:15] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[4:25:41] L0opito: meditation or absorption for shield i guess?
[4:25:44] luzid7: true what is this lel
[4:25:45] DisorderlyTV: could drop meditation tbh
[4:25:51] reach27: the 1 shot ability
[4:26:05] fakemejo: ARCANE DREAM ?
[4:26:15] guidelock: u hard cast a Arcane blast into POM Arcane blast into manapot surge
[4:26:21] guidelock: on ur sheeped priest
[4:26:24] luzid7: mana pot into arcane surge xD
[4:26:31] reach27: maybe get icy veins as well for the no knockback
[4:26:33] Neverwind_: and then you are the meme "Guess I will die"
[4:26:39] fakemejo: 4sec
[4:26:41] guidelock: i wanna say 4s
[4:26:44] luzid7: not long 4 sec  i think
[4:26:46] Neverwind_: 4x
[4:26:55] L0opito: 6sec debuff duration
[4:26:58] guidelock: so u can do 4 stcks on hunter pet, evo into surge for 1.9k crit
[4:27:03] guidelock: even rn
[4:27:07] fiskensfriend: Deadge
[4:27:23] guidelock: but if u kick the arcane cast
[4:27:24] reach27: i can hear ziqo laughing already
[4:27:27] guidelock: ur fcked
[4:27:31] satras12: arcane reflector where
[4:27:33] ama__deus: @reach27 KEKW
[4:27:42] eXTreMe1337: 30y range sucks on AB
[4:28:01] fakemejo: imagine what living flame is proccing for aswell
[4:28:13] guidelock: hope surge scales well perpRage
[4:28:34] Unholy_john: Why are we looking at mage talents? What about priest?
[4:28:35] DisorderlyTV: arcane surge drops another mage at 70% hp in a duel, so dumb
[4:28:35] guidelock: AMEN BROTHER
[4:28:39] luzid7: LUL
[4:28:42] reach27: the arcane dream 1 shot spec
[4:28:43] guidelock: u do the 2x AB into surge with arcane power up
[4:28:51] guidelock: its actually class
[4:29:27] guidelock: you die KEKW
[4:29:29] Inzio: you have spells and talents switched in arcane @Hydramist
[4:29:33] fatlance: yh arcane gonna be real man
[4:29:43] guidelock: change regen to enlightened
[4:29:46] guidelock: its 10% dmg
[4:29:48] guidelock: KEKW
[4:29:51] Sinostra: Lock can counter this
[4:29:56] eXTreMe1337: managem
[4:30:02] Wicks_TV: lock just pet locks this
[4:30:11] BiggieBoyZ: mana gem ofc
[4:30:11] reach27: gnome racial bis for this
[4:30:16] Sinostra: yeah, and dispels sheep
[4:30:23] rebelscumx: lock hunter druid
[4:30:26] guidelock: the 15% crit is better when u do crit, but the 10% is there always
[4:30:31] guidelock: so idk what we run
[4:30:32] Fluvluv: the pet is a class tbh
[4:30:51] Sinostra: bro, warlock pets are no hunter pets
[4:30:54] ama__deus: @guidelock well, not always. Only when you're 70%+ mana
[4:31:00] dreeeamyy: Alright, thats a wrap, time for horror GoldPLZ
[4:31:11] Sinostra: hunters will kill the arcane mage before the burst just with the pet
[4:31:12] guidelock: @ama__deus indeed, but u do ur combo out of sheep
[4:31:15] guidelock: so u can evo
[4:31:22] realScreaMy: well if arcane cget arcane barrage  :D would be better than surge
[4:31:24] guidelock: and mana pot/gem
[4:31:33] dreeeamyy: I can tell you are scared man ur stalling Kappa
[4:31:36] ama__deus: @guidelock for that 1shot gimmick, it'll def be available, yeah
[4:31:45] guidelock: yep
[4:31:53] Sinostra: Combat needs to be C then
[4:32:40] Fluvluv: i think shockadin is gonna be a thing in the future
[4:33:15] ama__deus: Balance probably leading the A tier at the very least
[4:33:19] dreeeamyy: S tier for balance 100%
[4:33:37] fiskensfriend: @Hydramist at 60 the ZG trinkit for mages increases arcane crit dmg by 50% LUL will be even bigger balast
[4:34:06] BiggieBoyZ: just give us starsurge instead
[4:34:12] dreeeamyy: do it just to tilt the Ret Andys LUL
[4:34:50] Neverwind_: That's for pve or pvp?
[4:35:05] Sinostra: @Neverwind_ pvp
[4:36:13] reach27: maybe ret A tier?
[4:36:17] dreeeamyy: looks good to me tbh
[4:36:20] Zaetv: Zaetv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 86 months! sheesh
[4:36:20] Inzio: @Hydramist isnt shadow going to suffer with mana most likely?
[4:36:22] playerpersonx: ele shaman is going to be absolutely cracked next phase, cant wait
[4:36:26] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: ret would put A
[4:37:09] fakemejo: balance need s+ they r getting convoke rune
[4:37:09] Neverwind_: Shadow wouldn't be S
[4:37:19] Neverwind_: Best is A
[4:37:20] LESSQEWQEWMOREPEWPEW: put some sexy class colours at the top
[4:38:14] reach27: arcane mage could be S depending on situaltion since they can also heal
[4:38:23] eXTreMe1337: hope they'll add more new spells and not many retail spells
[4:38:28] Sinostra: i think Demo lock is n/a
[4:38:34] GameOverz: can i see your ranks on the rogues :)
[4:38:37] Neverwind_: Biased
[4:38:57] dreeeamyy: But palas have purify right ?
[4:39:07] wcked07: ret will be s if they have pendulum of doom xD
[4:39:10] Fawh: warr C?
[4:39:12] dreeeamyy: its like cleanse light
[4:39:14] Fawh: Sadge
[4:39:27] Fawh: ah read that wrong
[4:39:37] Fawh: ye I think they are A too
[4:39:37] dreeeamyy: okey i see
[4:39:56] Kiwifruits: @Hydramist rsham with healing way/overload means their healing waves are gonna be insane, throw that in with their utility i think its easy S
[4:40:32] Lurvvvv: can u show druid tier list ?
[4:41:08] drumcodeforlife: Show me youre Shaman Tank Prediction
[4:41:11] drumcodeforlife: :>
[4:42:26] playerpersonx: rogue is in a bit of a weird spot cause you want talents in both combat and sub for mutilate spec, but obviously you want adrenaline rush or premed
[4:42:28] basydb: whats the spellbook addon?
[4:42:30] eXTreMe1337: but better escape with shifting
[4:42:36] realScreaMy: well if mage get hot streak rune he also hit S tier
[4:42:49] optik_rec0rds: @basydb isnt it just "whats training"
[4:43:08] basydb: @optik_rec0rds danke
[4:43:22] GameOverz: rogue with hemo build running with a feral...thoughts?
[4:43:31] Binarylime: Enhance is gonna suffer without Rockbiter Rune, making them squishy and losing double shock, also Lava Lash sucks. Wouldn't put it at A. Nothing atm is buffing an Enhance at it's core.  B tier at best and even that is a stretch.
[4:43:37] angrykittymeow: Hunters will get Sniper Shot
[4:43:40] reach27: missile barrage rune would be nuts for arcane
[4:43:50] playerpersonx: 31/0/20 hunter is going to be sick at 60 if pet damage stays high
[4:43:55] Binarylime: no
[4:43:56] hamzaderkiller: you think hunters without wotlk disengage will just get crushed by meeles @Hydramist
[4:43:58] Binarylime: Rockbiter needs main hand
[4:44:05] Binarylime: to get the rune buff
[4:44:11] Binarylime: it's shit
[4:44:18] Lurvvvv: Druid!
[4:44:21] Lurvvvv: !druid
[4:44:28] Binarylime: played Enhance in vanilla with full Naxx gear in pre patch
[4:44:35] Binarylime: it's gonna be the same as now
[4:44:41] sportscolax: just tuned in. how is lock doin
[4:44:44] Binarylime: just a squishy auto attack bot
[4:44:50] Toxiferous: move both down
[4:45:18] Toxiferous: both no mobility
[4:45:18] Rayman_1990: I hope they add colossus smash rune for warr. Prenerf 100% version FrankerZ
[4:45:29] Binarylime: can just try playing Sham rage now, it's not good at all
[4:45:32] Binarylime: survival wise
[4:45:37] Kiwifruits: man if rshamn gets riptide itll be kinda unfair with way of earth/kick/ground etc lol
[4:45:37] Binarylime: Enhance needs a full revamp
[4:46:05] Binarylime: no
[4:46:15] eXTreMe1337: sham get ankh for a 2nd try Kappa
[4:46:15] Toxiferous: if only
[4:46:18] Binarylime: it's the same with Rockbiter and feral WF atm
[4:46:28] GameOverz: am i stupid... hemo build rogue...open with garrote..saber slash..hemo..rupture..with a feral with mangle. thoughts chat? seems like it could be strong?
[4:46:30] Rizlah13: maybe they change the rune to rockbiter and wf
[4:46:32] yeahboimp4s: without way of earth shammys are so squishy
[4:46:37] BiggieBoyZ: ancestral guidance meme spec with healthstone/pot/recombulator
[4:46:45] playerpersonx: tbh combat mutilate will probably be decent if you just skip adrenaline rush
[4:47:16] tpleym: a fat sword from gonmer with cold blood and evis(40) might be just as broken as arcane surge?
[4:47:27] reach27: give mage spellsteal rune
[4:47:40] Binarylime: and Stormstrike in 40 is gonna be a huge dissapointment unless they make a rune for it. 20 Sec CD and it doesnt even buff Fire so no point in going Lava Burst for it. No synergy at all in this damn spec
[4:47:42] playerpersonx: yeah rogue is in a weird spot at 40 cause most specs want to skip level 40 talent but at the same time want it
[4:48:18] fakemejo: and make it useable for 2h
[4:48:18] Kiwifruits: theyll prolly give them primal strike or something like ret getting crusader
[4:48:18] wreckedgum: !song
[4:48:20] fakemejo: nvm it is
[4:48:25] wreckedgum: !playlist
[4:48:41] wreckedgum: can you share your playlist on spotify or whatever is bro?
[4:48:48] Binarylime: on another note. Who the hell made the Lava Burst and Flame Shock synergy? It's the most awkward design. 20 Yard range Flame shock + a global, then 2 sec cast Lava Burst...... wtf is that
[4:48:48] Hydramist: https://youtu.be/y4o3WAcfKOI?t=2879
[4:49:03] wreckedgum: legend, thanks
[4:49:33] Binarylime: yepp... and no1 thought to make Flame shock 30 yards within the Lava Burst rune
[4:50:00] Sinostra: Let's talk about locks
[4:50:06] Sinostra: Demo is n/a in pvp
[4:50:11] bigfrankwow: PS Hero would be good for Rogue
[4:50:19] Sinostra: it's the only spec in the game that doesn't get more damage
[4:50:19] reach27: did they release runes before phase 1 or were they datamined?
[4:50:45] reach27: oh yeah
[4:50:47] Sinostra: yeah but if it's only a tank, it'll be mostly useless
[4:51:00] Sinostra: and if meta is bannable, it'll be even worse
[4:51:02] BiggieBoyZ: not all of the runes were shown but most of them
[4:51:37] Rayman_1990: @Sinostra good for bullying phys dmg classes thats for sure
[4:51:43] realScreaMy: Frost with Deep Freeze or Elemental be S tier for sure same as Fire with hot streak rune
[4:52:06] realScreaMy: Agree

[4:52:28] Sinostra: @Rayman_1990 not if the lock plays felhunter
[4:52:29] playerpersonx: @Sinostra there are hardly any other talents in the two other warlock trees that increase damage. There's a little fire damage in destro and 10% shadow + a little curse of agony in affliction but thats it. demo will still be incredibly good in pvp with spell power gear and stam
[4:52:39] Xzanelol: Pog
[4:53:23] Sinostra: it adds up
[4:54:17] optik_rec0rds: corruption does less damage than void plague tho atleast atm
[4:54:19] eXTreMe1337: drainlife with masterchanneler does more dps than corruption on 1 target afaik
[4:54:37] playerpersonx: soul link + master channeler = warlocks are literal raid bosses
[4:55:00] turn2spikejester: Ele shaman is going to be HYYYUGGGGEEE :D
[4:55:03] Rayman_1990: @playerpersonx both are dispellable btw
[4:55:05] reazer93: meta soul link :)
[4:55:05] satras12: wait how do you kill wlock with SL and demon form as physical dmg class ? sounds impossible
[4:55:09] Sinostra: exactly, demo is a noob trap
[4:55:47] playerpersonx: @Rayman_1990 soul link is not dispellable
[4:55:55] Rayman_1990: @playerpersonx in vanilla it is
[4:56:07] notJumu: @Rayman_1990 it's not
[4:56:12] onemanwoifpack: Hows Druid?
[4:56:13] Koivoo: 42
[4:56:13] varatupaj: 42
[4:56:25] optik_rec0rds: yeah 42
[4:56:32] Rayman_1990: @notJumu it is I am 99.9 % sure, they changed that later
[4:56:39] optik_rec0rds: rank 3 is on lvl 34
[4:56:39] Sinostra: locks get everything at 42 LUL
[4:56:46] playerpersonx: @Rayman_1990 it is not my man. played warlock on private servers and classic at 60 for a long time. not dispellable
[4:56:52] varatupaj: corruption is r34 at 40, kinda meh
[4:57:03] hazt3r: show me mage :D
[4:57:03] bambucha34: what are the predictions for mage?
[4:57:06] Toxiferous: i think you can dispel it off the pet @playerpersonx
[4:57:15] wreckedgum: WOW streamers play the best tunes, no1 can tell me otherwise
[4:57:20] hazt3r: ty :)
[4:57:21] optik_rec0rds: and sadly coil is also on 42 :P
[4:57:25] chard_GG: shadow stier? :o
[4:57:26] vimovo: sorry off topic is your wpvp priest spec 5/2/9 - 4/5 blackout
[4:57:34] Sinostra: @optik_rec0rds and paranoia
[4:57:38] L0opito: Healing Mage going to be real annoying cuz of r2 dispel / purge
[4:57:43] Uprimex: Disc would be good?
[4:57:55] Ignz7: can u show warr
[4:58:00] Binarylime: just take some Frost DK abilities in Wrath, port them to Enhance ez
[4:58:09] playerpersonx: @Toxiferous that might be true, not sure about that
[4:58:10] Binarylime: Lightning Grip and some Obliterate thingy
[4:58:24] jarlo123: @hydramist u dont see balance getting hard nerfed on surge?
[4:58:35] vimovo: ty bro
[4:58:47] Toxiferous: @playerpersonx WoWhead does say Dispel type: Magic
[4:59:21] jarlo123: How u rated rogues/wars?
[4:59:43] Sinostra: @Hydramist can you share the excel file ? would be nice to access it
[4:59:49] turn2spikejester: Ele sham super strong I think. Best overall class for any situation/comp.
[5:00:12] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[5:00:30] playerpersonx: @Toxiferous yeah it is magic, but you cant dispel it off the warlock so I'm pretty sure it just reapplies after you dispel it from the pet
[5:00:48] Mikulasass: can u show rogue pred plz
[5:01:06] y6mz: rogue will be s surely
[5:02:08] dogsenses: when is rogue not S tier, every single expansion since TBC they have been one of the best, if not the best class both pvp and pve
[5:02:18] jarlo123: Have u rated wars?
[5:02:30] bigfrankwow: rogue will be good, but hard ot imagine its holds its value in large scale wpvp after a few of them key cooldowns are gone
[5:02:36] SnotBoogey: i hope mage gets spellsteal
[5:02:40] reach27: missile barrage rune plz
[5:02:58] SnotBoogey: are they gonna open up slots for more runes or still just 3 runes?
[5:03:03] notJumu: @Rayman_1990 https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-era-%E2%80%9Cnot-a-bug%E2%80%9D-list-updated-april-22-2021/175887 "Soul Link cannot be dispelled by dispelling the Warlock’s pet." You either have to kill the pet or banish them to remove SL
[5:03:12] reach27: there will be 6 rune slots
[5:03:19] dogsenses: I dont think anyone can argue that rogue has been the main class in wow since inception
[5:03:31] fakemejo: next idea @Hydramist  pre bis raid for shadow/disc :)
[5:03:38] fakemejo: p2
[5:03:55] reach27: might be some boe greens that are good
[5:04:00] varatupaj: so best way to counter sl warlock is another warlock :D
[5:04:02] illigazz: new follower, so couldnt chat earlier. For lock, dont need improve corruption. just hard cast corruption once then use everlasting rune so it never falls off tho
[5:04:07] dogsenses: just the default 1sec gcd they have is already hidden OP, every other class besides feral and unholy dk need FIFFTY percent (50 % fucking haste) to reach what they have by default
[5:04:16] TheZtiff: I hope we gona get valeu from enginering this phase
[5:04:27] dogsenses: hello ??
[5:04:28] reach27: aint no way im gridning exalted for bracers
[5:04:28] lncandenza: Na there's a bunch of good gear nearing 40. You really only need staff/neck/trinket
[5:04:33] playerpersonx: @dogsenses you realise this is a completely new version of WoW right? so they are not S tier in relation to other classes in this new version of WoW where other classes are better
[5:04:34] moarpwp: @Hydramist you put affli S but you didn't mention about them as top5. Do you have doubt about them? I mean they have worst last talent but maybe blizzard touches that skill :/
[5:04:37] lncandenza: Rest you can replace with better stuff
[5:04:44] y6mz: hard casting corruption feels so bad
[5:04:51] Unholy_john: @Hydramist Can you show lvl 40 shadow pvp talents pls?
[5:05:07] Sinostra: @illigazz only works if there is only 1 target
[5:05:16] Sinostra: and it's still a 2 sec cast
[5:05:17] varatupaj: you can seduce to cast corruption
[5:05:23] tpleym: it think destro going to be good
[5:05:43] Sinostra: @varatupaj yeah, but the succubus is useless after

[5:06:09] Toxiferous: I've seen a table how more +hit combats resistance
[5:06:13] Toxiferous: its really technical tho
[5:06:47] playerpersonx: @Toxiferous does +hit even combat resistance? I thought you needed spell pen to do that
[5:06:50] kevinrmp: wait wait, i really dont think shadow focus hit chance will affect resist table, but only hit table
[5:06:52] varatupaj: @Sinostra with demon she gives you more dmg, and you can use seduce to interrupt spell casts
[5:06:52] notJumu: no imp VE?
[5:07:01] jaimonji: do you think they will add SoD 2s on 60?
[5:07:21] jarlike: Just tuned in.. Are you going  to upload this?
[5:07:23] Toxiferous: I can try to find, its prob buried in a class discord
[5:07:28] moarpwp: @Hydramist i miss some part of stream, can you talk aobut affli? I mean dark pact is joke but I think affli way to go unfortunately
[5:07:45] tpleym: why 5 in shadow focus for pvp?
[5:07:55] Sinostra: @varatupaj isn't seduce a 1.5 or 2sec cast in classic ?
[5:07:59] jaimonji: What do you think of trispec at 60 for like party pvp
[5:08:10] tpleym: ah okey, thanks
[5:08:19] Unholy_john: Too bad we cannot get unbreakable will at 40
[5:08:27] L0opito: Hit affects resistance if the spell is binary only afaik
[5:08:32] varatupaj: @Sinostra yes but its of your gsd, so if you react fast enough you can interrupt heals
[5:09:36] Sinostra: @varatupaj it's cluncky af
[5:10:14] L0opito: @Hydramist https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Binary_spell
[5:10:24] xswamps: !bis
[5:10:24] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AuG_Cve3KE
[5:10:35] kevinrmp: vamp touch could be rly clunky as vamp embrace is a debuff. so u have to debuff 4 times before you get to cast
[5:11:00] L0opito: Because binary spells can't partial resist
[5:11:03] varatupaj: @Sinostra i agree that felhunter spellock is better, but still possible to pull of and has no cd
[5:11:22] Sinostra: @varatupaj it does apply the dr tho
[5:11:27] devoedm8: @Hydramist how does pala rank to lock at 40?
[5:11:46] kevinrmp: so the hit talent will only affect stuff like mind blast and death for enemy resitances then?
[5:11:54] L0opito: Oh ye
[5:11:59] jarlike: no longer rank 1 frostbolt?
[5:11:59] L0opito: My bad
[5:12:17] L0opito: I thought it was hit ye
[5:12:18] illigazz: so for Spriest it's only good for like MindBlast, ShadowWord Death etc
[5:12:30] xDropperd: Maybe still hit, but tooltip was cleaned up
[5:12:30] illigazz: since they are binary
[5:12:34] mrabs0lute: !talents
[5:12:34] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[5:12:39] Unholy_john: Should be easy to test at 40
[5:12:47] Unholy_john: or once p2 hits
[5:12:49] vimovo: do you think its too early in sod for them to introduce never seen before runes
[5:13:08] illigazz: mage has all new stuff so
[5:13:51] vimovo: true true
[5:14:07] erik93: shadow priest S tier for p2? didnt see ur list
[5:14:33] eXTreMe1337: @hydramist will there be a good hybrid priest build at 40?
[5:14:44] dreeeamyy: all i want is the classes i play being buffed and everyone else nerfed
[5:14:51] TheZtiff: What makes ele s tier?
[5:14:51] dreeeamyy: not too much to ask tbh
[5:14:52] Uprimex: Disc would be good as well, with PI
[5:15:13] GamerGierr: breakable will amirite
[5:16:41] Rayman_1990: @notJumu ye Ive just tested on my era lock actually, despite saying "magic" shammy couldnt purge it, cant even cancel it by right click
[5:16:48] kevinrmp: i think wotlk has penance pushback, but the talent is 70% reduced pushback rather than 70% chance to avoid pushback, making you never get pushed back enough to lose a tick
[5:16:53] infuze27: yeah thats my only gripe with lvl 40 phase, u end up wanting a few more points lol
[5:17:28] infuze27: oh yea im pumped for 50-60
[5:17:35] Toxiferous: I found an explanation for +spell hit
[5:17:45] baelgond: no spirit tap on disc for pvp?
[5:18:08] Toxiferous: just click the guide link up top in the resistance calc site
[5:18:14] poistay: does spirit tap work in bgs?
[5:18:23] baelgond: vanguard disc priest
[5:18:46] Toxiferous: yes
[5:18:57] Toxiferous: down in binary spells category
[5:19:01] Toxiferous: there is a formula
[5:19:06] jarlike: Remove resist :)
[5:19:28] Toxiferous: the explanation is below the formula
[5:20:08] eXTreMe1337: 26 pages, looks like he did his phd on that
[5:20:20] Toxiferous: least obsessed wow player
[5:21:07] dreeeamyy: what about non-binery they/them spells ?
[5:21:40] dogsenses: lgbt spellls  OP ?
[5:21:44] Toxiferous: it goes into further detail in the Binary Spells category
[5:22:05] Sinostra: what about dots ?
[5:22:06] kevinrmp: frostbolt not being able to partially resist is sus. im sure ive had that happen many a times before
[5:22:11] Sinostra: are they binary ?
[5:22:35] Toxiferous: frostbolt doesnt partial. at least it didnt in classic 2020
[5:22:36] y6mz: dots cant partially resist so
[5:22:48] dreeeamyy: lets read a 60 page research document to figure this out LUL
[5:22:57] notJumu: even if it doesn't count as hit it will help binary spells like fear get resisted less because it's -10% spell resist chance
[5:23:04] L0opito: Reminds me of the video of Ziqo with his shadow res gear. Basically dots are scuffed and can't partial resists on ticks
[5:23:20] eXTreMe1337: ^this
[5:23:23] Toxiferous: well they can partial if the first tick partials
[5:23:37] Toxiferous: but they dont if the first tick hits full afaik
[5:24:04] dreeeamyy: cant you just re-apply the dot until its perfect
[5:24:09] fakemejo: scale from 1-10 how fried is ur brain now ryan
[5:24:09] Toxiferous: yes
[5:24:37] ezypzxd: It says right there what that resistance chance mean
[5:24:39] y6mz: that would be insane
[5:25:07] dreeeamyy: the amount of dedication that some guy put into figuring this out is amazing
[5:25:18] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[5:25:59] Toxiferous: we stand on the shoulders of giants
[5:26:36] Toxiferous: I think it's just a tooltip
[5:26:38] dreeeamyy: ”hello my name is twitch chat and i have a PHD in Wow Classic resistance calculations”
[5:26:52] ezypzxd: Localweedman
[5:26:53] flowen001: can you test it ?
[5:26:54] marcid2k: less hit requires
[5:26:55] Toxiferous: it's just hit
[5:27:06] ezypzxd: “Reduces the chance targets resist your spells by x%” - these mean the same thing, that it reduces the chance of spell misses
[5:27:06] Binarylime: when we played vanilla, everyone said that u needed 7% hit as Shadow to be hit capped. Should be able to check warcraftlogs for it aswell
[5:27:44] Toxiferous: does it show school specific hit?
[5:27:47] Toxiferous: dont think it does
[5:27:50] Binarylime: the addon doesn't work for current Enhance Dual Wield Spec for 10% either, so don't look at that for confirmation
[5:28:02] dreeeamyy: i dont think it shows school specific hit from talents
[5:28:04] dreeeamyy: ye
[5:28:06] Oztecx: shadow got really messed up with everyones +shadow resist from BFD gear. like my priest had +35 res
[5:28:12] xDropperd: Did you get 3 hit from boon?
[5:28:21] Binarylime: but every1 treated the 10% from talent as 10% hit
[5:28:54] tpleym: Do note that this talent is not a form of spell penetration, and will not reduce the effects of a target's resistance. Shadow resistance will grant targets the same chance to fully resist shadow spells regardless of this talent.
[5:28:54] misstherese: 🤔
[5:29:32] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Isn't shadow ress bugged in classic?
[5:30:24] kevinrmp: mind flay should be binary too then? since it slows
[5:30:31] kevinrmp: though its also a "dot"
[5:30:43] Peoplewhinetoomuch: I remember Ziqo talking about it for the Mak'gora tournament. He farmed a shadow ress set but skipped it because he took more shadow dmg with the set.
[5:30:45] tpleym: wich means, its basically hit cahnce
[5:31:41] jarlike: Did that mean you can cast Fb and apply slow withouth damage?
[5:32:16] Toxiferous: nope
[5:32:29] notJumu: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15330/shadow-focus#comments
[5:32:30] notJumu: "Do note that this talent is not a form of spell penetration, and will not reduce the effects of a target's resistance. Shadow resistance will grant targets the same chance to fully resist shadow spells regardless of this talent."
[5:32:36] Toxiferous: either you hit the fb and apply the slow or it misses
[5:33:04] kevinrmp: imagine if heals could miss and resist
[5:33:05] L0opito: @Hydramist Extended Character Stats shows Focus as +hits, just tried it on my Priest
[5:33:34] felstavd: I will full send holy nova build :D
[5:33:43] Xzanelol: lmfao
[5:33:45] Rayman_1990: @kevinrmp that would be nice april fools trolling Kappa
[5:33:46] fakemejo: 26 pages, how this guy got paid
[5:33:47] notJumu: haha fair enough
[5:33:52] fakemejo: hope*
[5:33:57] jerotw: he literally wrote a physics course
[5:34:23] jarlike: Does this mean mages cant FB rank1 stack?
[5:34:26] eXTreMe1337: doctor spellhit
[5:34:36] tpleym: but thats tbc no?
[5:35:54] L0opito: Some mechanics work like wotlk in SoD, safe to think this is accurate kek
[5:36:26] Toxiferous: 75% is the cap of dmg reduction
[5:36:32] Toxiferous: from resistance
[5:36:33] L0opito: ^ye
[5:36:39] jaimonji: if you go deep shadow you can still heal bgs?
[5:36:42] jarlike: where did the -25% come from?
[5:36:53] L0opito: cuz 100% is basically a miss
[5:36:53] Unholy_john: because at max resistance there is still 25% miss
[5:37:11] Toxiferous: yes
[5:37:19] notJumu: if u plug in the +10% hit from shadow focus into the calc it shows u it doesn't change the overall chance of resist. Only spell pen does.
[5:37:23] jaimonji: if you go deep shadow you can still heal bgs with like healing runes
[5:37:50] Toxiferous: 125
[5:38:06] jaimonji: they will add new rune slots for the new runes or still 3 rune slots?
[5:38:08] jujujay_myalias: It's basically a fraction of the amount of resistance your target has and the cap (which is target's lvl *5). The max it can be is 75% so you find the actual by multiplying the fraction by the max
[5:38:23] Unholy_john: the 25% is wrong
[5:38:25] Toxiferous: you cant reduce the equation
[5:38:32] Toxiferous: PEMDAS
[5:38:38] Toxiferous: order of operations
[5:38:42] Unholy_john: multiply 75% times the resistance quotient first
[5:38:50] Unholy_john: then subtract from 100%
[5:39:05] Peoplewhinetoomuch: math NotLikeThis  my weakest link
[5:39:12] Unholy_john: so at max resistance the number in brackets would be 25%
[5:39:20] Toxiferous: yes 100% is 1
[5:39:21] jujujay_myalias: They do the 100 - to switch it from "chance to resist" to "chance to hit"
[5:39:29] jujujay_myalias: so chance to hit is 100 - chance to resist
[5:39:33] Unholy_john: Just look at the formula for max resistance
[5:39:52] Unholy_john: the quotient would be 1 and that means 25% chance to hit * 0.96 + the spell hit
[5:40:51] Unholy_john: Can you link the doc somewhere pls?
[5:40:56] eXTreMe1337: shouldnt it be 0.13 instead of 13
[5:41:01] Toxiferous: yes
[5:41:08] jarlike: a little Jealous of ppl that understand this math!
[5:41:44] Unholy_john: @jarlike It's not that hard to be honest. The question is whether the forn
[5:41:48] Unholy_john: formula is correct
[5:42:04] Toxiferous: 86/76
[5:42:26] Toxiferous: so talent is +13% effectiveness
[5:42:45] Sinostra: doen't that depend where the talent's calculationn comes in ?
[5:42:48] notJumu: @Hydramist plug the #s into the calc with shadow focus as +10% hit, it doesn't change the overall chance of resist. Only spell pen does.
[5:43:00] Unholy_john: Spell hit seems much better than spell pen
[5:43:02] jarlike: @Fnatic_Benny W/e you dont feel is hard might be hard :)
[5:43:19] Peoplewhinetoomuch: So the wsg 10 spell pen trinket is huuuuuge Kappa
[5:43:28] Toxiferous: @notJumu it only works for binary spells
[5:44:15] Toxiferous: you have to check the binary spell box
[5:44:19] Toxiferous: for it to account for hit
[5:45:07] Unholy_john: Level *5
[5:46:07] dreeeamyy: Considering how much math scared me in school this is sort of horror in a way
[5:46:35] dreeeamyy: if i had 10% of ur smartness, imagine
[5:46:40] Peoplewhinetoomuch: trinket
[5:46:40] jarlike: @dreeeamyy This might be a way to redeem the horror
[5:46:59] jarlike: Math is powerfull
[5:47:23] notJumu: @Toxiferous it's checked, binary spells at lvl 40 pvp with 40 shadow res and 20 spell pen and +13% spell hit have an 8.42% overall chance to resist because only spell pen reduces the remaining resist chance of 8%
[5:47:33] dreeeamyy: Ryan studied math right? it shows
[5:47:42] jujujay_myalias: It's quite interesting how valuable something like shadow res is at lvl 25 given that the cap is 125. That means even the random item with 5 or 10 res actually does quite a bit of work
[5:47:44] Peoplewhinetoomuch: does motw give any resistance at lvl 40?
[5:47:49] roshlando: its basic math
[5:48:01] Unholy_john: Math at university is not about calculating anything LUL
[5:48:09] dreeeamyy: man i dont know what 7 times 7 is
[5:48:12] Unholy_john: You only prove theorems
[5:48:15] jarlike: Does all this math include the 1% miss chanse?
[5:48:18] dreeeamyy: and u call this basic math
[5:48:39] encrypteddeath: Are you still doing this?
[5:49:03] fakemejo: u are only on page 11/26 still a few to go Kappa
[5:49:18] dreeeamyy: @encrypteddeath he is wired in now
[5:49:19] Ben_Loz: they might add draenei next phase get racial hit
[5:49:39] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @jarlike do you mean to resist?
[5:49:42] Unholy_john: TLDR: run hit not spell pen
[5:49:43] notJumu: @Hydramist if u plug these #s into the calc the only thing that changes the resist chance is spell pen not spell hit%
[5:49:45] dreeeamyy: xD
[5:49:49] jujujay_myalias: Also spell pen is really good
[5:49:53] codelean: @Hydramist i think romeyoyo will be stier? whats your opinion on that?
[5:49:59] fakemejo: so we go 5/5 regardless
[5:50:04] life_waste: magic resist pot at 50 resist
[5:50:07] dreeeamyy: all this studying for conclusion ”this talent is pretty good” Kappa
[5:50:13] tpleym: so yea, full shadow focus. till u maybe get alot hit on gear
[5:51:13] eXTreMe1337: lot of ppl will still wear pearl in p2 for a while
[5:51:16] encrypteddeath: Do you think Shadow priest will be viable for raids next phase?
[5:51:34] Danzolicious: It will be ok, but only 1
[5:51:59] jujujay_myalias: Alright now let's do non-binary!
[5:52:02] Unholy_john: @dreeeamyy The question was rather whether you would waste talent points :)
[5:52:04] Sinostra: the calculations are wayyyyyy more complicated in non-binary spells cases
[5:52:44] notJumu: @Hydramist the calculator results on this site for binary spells directly contradict the conclusion we've arrived at here ><
[5:53:02] Toxiferous: did you click the binary spell box?
[5:53:07] notJumu: yes
[5:53:20] notJumu: refreshed and reopened and replicated the same results multiple times now
[5:53:22] Toxiferous: interesting
[5:53:38] dreeeamyy: @fnatic_benny it just sounded funny ^^
[5:53:42] Peoplewhinetoomuch: what is a binary spell?
[5:53:43] infuze27: thats a long short LUL
[5:53:45] jarlike: So as Benny said . Is it worth spending points in as  disc?
[5:53:48] luzid7: 8 boomkins 2 priests. i better wait 15 min lol
[5:53:59] Toxiferous: @notJumu i see the results change when i click the box
[5:54:03] L0opito: :D
[5:54:14] infuze27: READ MORE
[5:54:20] jarlike: Keep going
[5:54:21] kevinrmp: @jarlike most likely yes for pvp
[5:54:24] koeniz: read more
[5:54:25] jujujay_myalias: non-binary!
[5:54:33] jujujay_myalias: We wanna know about dots
[5:54:35] Unholy_john: What did the doc say on non-binary spells?
[5:54:35] jarlike: with a scary voice
[5:54:40] Sinostra: non binary spells are more complicated
[5:54:47] Unholy_john: Hit doesn't do anything against resistances there, right?
[5:54:49] encrypteddeath: What is the magic hit rating you want to completely avoid 50 shadow res?
[5:54:52] Sinostra: the math are the scary part yeah
[5:55:15] notJumu: @Toxiferous the results change if u toggle between binary but for binary toggled on more spell hit in the box does not reduce the overall resist % only spell pen does
[5:55:48] jarlike: Why was six afraid of seven?
[5:56:09] unhoLynx_: because seven eight nine
[5:56:15] notJumu: there's no difference between +3% and +13% spell hit on binary according to the calculator
[5:56:17] jarlike: :)
[5:56:43] L0opito: based Mage discord
[5:57:04] xDropperd: Can't you use both the  lvl 20 and the lvl 40 trinket for +30 spell pen?
[5:57:25] vimovo: bro wrote a thesis
[5:57:47] Toxiferous: @Toxiferous i see a change in Overall chance of resist ⓘ box
[5:58:12] jarlike: it is always 1% chanse?
[5:58:39] drisslikethis: ziqo cries in raid boss gear
[5:58:47] infuze27: why do u think they made it like that :O
[5:58:57] infuze27: like a random 1% resist in a duel tourney is stupid
[5:59:03] Toxiferous: because 2004 reasons
[5:59:12] infuze27: true
[5:59:21] Peoplewhinetoomuch: but how can it be worse to have resistance?
[5:59:23] infuze27: and it wasnt supposed to be balanced around pvp/1v1 i guess
[5:59:37] luzid7: could you link that pls
[5:59:46] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Or maybe i remember wrong that he said he took more dmg.
[5:59:51] Toxiferous: @Peoplewhinetoomuch its not, Ziqo died faster because he sacrificed stam gear for resist
[6:00:08] Toxiferous: so he died faster because he had less hp
[6:00:13] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[6:00:29] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @Toxiferous makes sense
[6:01:59] jarlike: Lpool  versus  Bournemouth any watching tomorrow :)
[6:03:01] Unholy_john: Insane how much testing must have gone into this LUL
[6:03:09] jarlike: soft and hard cap?
[6:04:42] Toxiferous: its all the way on the right
[6:04:53] Toxiferous: but its nice to get blue line to 0 for less burst
[6:04:56] jujujay_myalias: Well they always add to 100 right
[6:06:38] jujujay_myalias: I think the main takeaway here is just that hit chance and resistance are separate when it comes to non-binaries. Going over hit cap has no effect on reducing partial resists
[6:07:02] notJumu: could u plug these values into the binary spell calculator again pls? Overall chance of resist doesn't seem to change between +3% and +13% spell hit on there only spell pen reduces it
[6:11:19] tpleym: damn
[6:11:48] jarlike: Does that apply for PVE also?
[6:12:00] illigazz: afflication all of a sudden sounding pretty good lads
[6:12:19] Sinostra: it does mention wow classic
[6:12:25] Unholy_john: I wonder whether Void plague works the same as sw:p
[6:12:41] Unholy_john: The other day 30+mobs always resisted vp but not sw:d
[6:12:41] jujujay_myalias: Didn't Ziqo say that if the first DOT tick was not partially resisted, none of the subsequent resistance rolls happened. But if it was partially resisted then the subsequent resistance rolls did occur? Still seems vaguely buggy and different than what this is describing
[6:12:43] gororororoo: gororororoo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[6:12:54] jarlike: So no Dot snapchotting?
[6:14:04] jujujay_myalias: That sounds like they fucked up and somehow rolled back that change
[6:14:24] Sinostra: dots only use 1/10 of the target's resistance anyways
[6:14:36] HaeliusTV: !server
[6:14:37] Nightbot: Living Flame Horde EU / Crusader Strike Horde US
[6:14:48] Sinostra: so either way, it's pretty unlikely they get partial resists
[6:14:55] Toxiferous: so just stack 10x shadow res EZ
[6:15:02] Sinostra: i can log on ally if you wanna test
[6:15:11] Unholy_john: Can you reach the resistance cap in Sod? Can you get 125?
[6:15:19] Unholy_john: Prob not, right?
[6:15:58] Sinostra: warlocks have a bit more
[6:16:09] Sinostra: demon armor gives shadow res
[6:16:12] Toxiferous: DMF res for LULZ
[6:16:13] DisorderlyTV: the other 5 is from offhand
[6:16:14] Unholy_john: So hard to test whether the claim that it's linear holds true
[6:16:19] eXTreMe1337: mage can get 10 from arcanetree
[6:16:24] jujujay_myalias: the wand has 5 and one of the Off hands has 5. Plus 10 cloak ennchant
[6:16:45] bloodandbone: hydra witch addon do you use to see the numbers on your spell?
[6:16:47] Sinostra: demon armor gives shadow res
[6:16:52] HaeliusTV: link the doc plz

[6:17:25] jujujay_myalias: That's still a decent amount with a cap of 125 though. Certainly resistance does have some value at 25
[6:17:27] jarlike: Shadow focus is the big one
[6:17:37] Sinostra: i can test it as lock
[6:17:40] Sinostra: on my fear
[6:17:45] bloodandbone: hydra witch addon do you use to see the numbers on your spell?
[6:18:06] Toxiferous: yes
[6:18:06] kevinrmp: fear is affliction yes
[6:18:21] Sinostra: yeah it should
[6:18:54] Sinostra: true
[6:19:04] bloodandbone: can u say again pls
[6:19:11] Toxiferous: stat weight classic
[6:19:18] jujujay_myalias: Also a WA to track partial resist DOTs would be huge. Imagine an everlasting affliction partially resisted corruptionn.. rip
[6:19:37] Toxiferous: can i has VIP for finding source?
[6:19:58] reach27: whats the plan for leveling 25-40?
[6:20:03] bluegorillas: hi,what gpu you currently using?

[6:21:42] jujujay_myalias: I'll try to make one for myself tomorrow. Can share it if I figure it out
[6:21:55] tpleym: a small 4 hour sess on hit
[6:21:57] jujujay_myalias: nvm
[6:22:08] Sinostra: i'd say you need a non dot binary spell to test 1
[6:22:16] jarlike: Stay for the math
[6:22:21] dreeeamyy: LUL LUL LUL
[6:22:29] MikeKrond: too little math for my taste
[6:22:29] Mystylerocks: phd on resistances SeemsGood
[6:22:33] Eavesdropz93: I enjoyed the Math seminar
[6:22:34] Sinostra: non binary dot*
[6:22:38] dreeeamyy: i came for the horror i stayd for the math class
[6:22:44] Beastylol: Resist 101 with professor Hydra

[6:23:11] xDropperd: There is no good hit chance vods out there. This is gold
[6:23:14] eXTreMe1337: "finally we can play the game"
[6:23:25] Toxiferous: all you really need is a scrolling battle text to show dmg resisted
[6:23:25] jarlike: It's almost 0000!  that is a scary  time to play
[6:23:35] dreeeamyy: please dont link him anything new about resistances
[6:23:40] dreeeamyy: chat i beg you

[6:24:06] Sinostra: that was the true horror
[6:24:12] Blgdiesel: could you show the tier list?
[6:24:30] Kiroxx: ugliest priest ever!
[6:24:32] Instaby: are you using a protractor or a gonomioter for you beard design?
[6:25:01] Ben_Loz: going from N/A to S is crazy
[6:25:14] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[6:25:44] reach27: warrior always reliant on pocket healers
[6:26:04] sterikacid: But the new runes could change this completely?
[6:26:48] Toxiferous: yep
[6:27:05] UMRIz: can you link this sheet?
[6:27:38] Toxiferous: affliction always OP at lvl 39 twink bracket
[6:27:40] jarlike: @UMRIz Same
[6:27:46] smuga0: HeyGuys
[6:27:48] smuga0: we need u on wrath
[6:29:02] Kiroxx: and when arcanesurge gets fixed finally.
[6:29:05] xDropperd: Does the New Talents / Spells change any of the meta runes for PvP, like Burnout/Scorch?
[6:29:06] Kiroxx: not regen orking atm.
[6:29:14] Toxiferous: gnome mage so good for arcane surge
[6:29:16] reach27: missile barrage rune plz
[6:29:21] Blgdiesel: cool I'm assuming you will revisit it when we get the new runes
[6:30:02] eXTreMe1337: i see prices of arcane res gear going to da moon
[6:30:38] Sinostra: let's just find some math formulas about that other game
[6:30:55] Blgdiesel: monkaW warning
[6:31:28] dreeeamyy: monkaGIGA
[6:31:37] jarlike: Salt and iron for Ghost's-
[6:31:42] Creoxx: monkaGIGA
[6:32:11] smuga0: monkaGIGA
[6:33:36] dreeeamyy: Hes got aweful stats tho
[6:33:41] dreeeamyy: only 0’s
[6:33:43] dreeeamyy: smh
[6:36:25] smuga0: SeemsGood
[6:36:30] jarlike: You got the same eerie effect aas the game
[6:36:36] Sinostra: only 0 demons banished makes sense
[6:36:46] Sinostra: locks don't have banish yet at 25
[6:36:47] dreeeamyy: production value 10/10
[6:38:13] Creoxx: i was just about to ask, is that santa, but it actually is KEKW
[6:39:14] jarlike: Guessing salt and iron is not enough to win this round?
